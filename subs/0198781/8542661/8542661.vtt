All right,
Mr Bile, is it?

36
00:03:38.627 --> 00:03:41.016
Uh... my friends
call me Phlegm.

37
00:03:41.107 --> 00:03:42.301
Uh-huh.

38
00:03:42.387 --> 00:03:44.503
Mr Bile, can you tell me
what you did wrong?

39
00:03:44.587 --> 00:03:45.622
I fell down?

40
00:03:45.707 --> 00:03:47.425
No, no, before that.

41
00:03:47.507 --> 00:03:51.102
Can anyone tell me
Mr Bile's big mistake?

42
00:03:51.187 --> 00:03:52.415
Anyone?

43
00:03:52.507 --> 00:03:54.065
( coughs )

44
00:03:54.147 --> 00:03:54.863
( groans )

45
00:03:54.947 --> 00:03:56.300
Let's take a look
at the tape.

46
00:03:56.387 --> 00:03:57.342
Here we go.

47
00:03:57.427 --> 00:03:59.418
Uh, right...
puh-puh-puh-puh...

48
00:03:59.507 --> 00:04:00.906
Ah! There, see?

49
00:04:00.987 --> 00:04:02.739
The door.
You left it wide open.

50
00:04:02.827 --> 00:04:03.577
( whiopers )

51
00:04:03.667 --> 00:04:05.259
( all ourouring )

52
00:04:05.347 --> 00:04:07.224
And leaving the door open
is the worst mistake

53
00:04:07.307 --> 00:04:09.821
any employee
can make because...?

54
00:04:09.907 --> 00:04:12.580
Um... it could let in a draft?

55
00:04:12.667 --> 00:04:13.941
It could let in

56
00:04:14.027 --> 00:04:15.983
a child!

57
00:04:16.067 --> 00:04:17.136
Oh! Mr Waternoose!

58
00:04:17.227 --> 00:04:21.857
There is nothing more toxic
or deadly than a human child.

59
00:04:21.947 --> 00:04:24.017
A single touch could kill you!

60
00:04:24.107 --> 00:04:25.984
Leave a door open

61
00:04:26.067 --> 00:04:28.865
and a child could walk
right into this factory!

62
00:04:28.947 --> 00:04:30.778
Right into the monster world!

63
00:04:30.867 --> 00:04:32.095
I won't go
in a kid's room!

64
00:04:32.187 --> 00:04:33.063
You can't make me!

65
00:04:33.147 --> 00:04:35.980
You're going in there
because we need this.

66
00:04:36.067 --> 00:04:38.217
( children screaoing )

67
00:04:38.307 --> 00:04:40.025
( whiopering )

68
00:04:40.107 --> 00:04:41.222
( static and feedback )

69
00:04:41.307 --> 00:04:42.183
( screaoing stops )

70
00:04:42.267 --> 00:04:44.178
Our city is counting on you

71
00:04:44.267 --> 00:04:46.383
to collect
those children's screams.

72
00:04:46.467 --> 00:04:49.140
Without scream,
we have no power.

73
00:04:49.227 --> 00:04:51.058
Yes, it's dangerous work

74
00:04:51.147 --> 00:04:53.945
and that's why I need
you to be at your best.

75
00:04:54.027 --> 00:04:56.939
I need scarers
who are confident, tenacious

76
00:04:57.027 --> 00:04:59.700
tough, intimidating.

77
00:04:59.787 --> 00:05:05.020
I need scarers like... like...
James P. Sullivan.

78
00:05:05.107 --> 00:05:07.985

79
00:05:08.067 --> 00:05:09.739
Hey! Good morning,

It's now five after

00:05:12.067 --> 00:05:13.386
in the big monster city.

82
00:05:13.467 --> 00:05:15.059
Temperature's a
balmy 65 degrees--

83
00:05:15.147 --> 00:05:16.978
which is good news
for you reptiles--

84
00:05:17.067 --> 00:05:19.297
and it looks like it's
going to be a perfect day

85
00:05:19.387 --> 00:05:21.298
to maybe, hey,
just lie in bed, sleep in

86
00:05:21.387 --> 00:05:25.062
or simply... work out that flab
that's hanging over the bed!

87
00:05:25.147 --> 00:05:26.500
Get up, Sulley!

88
00:05:26.587 --> 00:05:28.259
-( honking )
-( screaoing )

89
00:05:28.347 --> 00:05:32.022
I don't believe I ordered
a wake-up call, Mikey.

90
00:05:32.107 --> 00:05:34.018
Hey! Less talk, more pain,
marshmallow boy!

91
00:05:34.107 --> 00:05:35.506
-( growling )
-Feel the burn!

92
00:05:35.587 --> 00:05:36.861
You call yourself
a monster?

93
00:05:36.947 --> 00:05:37.823
( growling )

94
00:05:37.907 --> 00:05:39.306
Scary feet, scary feet,
scary feet!

95
00:05:39.387 --> 00:05:40.422
Oop! The kid's awake!

96
00:05:40.507 --> 00:05:42.099
Okay, scary feet, scary feet,
scary feet, scary feet--

97
00:05:42.187 --> 00:05:43.063
Kid's asleep!

98

( roaring )

99
00:05:44.107 --> 00:05:45.176
Twins! In a bunk bed!

100
00:05:45.267 --> 00:05:47.497
( growling )

101
00:05:47.587 --> 00:05:48.815
Ooh! I thought I had you there.

102
00:05:48.907 --> 00:05:50.340
Okay, Sulley, here we go.

103
00:05:50.427 --> 00:05:51.576
You ready? Follow it.

104
00:05:51.667 --> 00:05:52.622
Oh! It's over here!

105
00:05:52.707 --> 00:05:53.776
Oh, look over there!

106
00:05:53.867 --> 00:05:55.141
Don't let the kid
touch you!

107
00:05:55.227 --> 00:05:56.216
Don't let it touch you!

108
00:05:56.307 --> 00:05:58.059
I don't know,
but it's been said

109
00:05:58.147 --> 00:05:59.580
I love scaring kids in bed!

110
00:05:59.667 --> 00:06:01.498
Come on, fight that plaque!
Fight that plaque!

111
00:06:01.587 --> 00:06:02.815
Scary monsters
don't have plaque!

112
00:06:02.907 --> 00:06:05.137
1 1 8... do you have 1 1 9?

113
00:06:05.227 --> 00:06:06.626
Do I see 1 20?

114
00:06:06.707 --> 00:06:07.822
Oh, I don't believe it!

115
00:06:07.907 --> 00:06:09.260
I'm not even
breaking a sweat.

116
00:06:09.347 --> 00:06:10.223
Not you!

117
00:06:10.307 --> 00:06:11.456

the window of innocence
is shrinking.

136

Human kids are harder to scare.

137
00:06:45.747 --> 00:06:48.261
Of course, M.I. is prepared
for the future

138
00:06:48.347 --> 00:06:49.416

I can't believe it.

149
00:07:11.347 --> 00:07:12.382
Oh, Mike...

150
00:07:12.467 --> 00:07:14.822
I was on TV!

151
00:07:14.907 --> 00:07:16.420
Did you see me?
I'm a natural!

152
00:07:16.507 --> 00:07:17.383
( phone rings )

153
00:07:17.467 --> 00:07:18.343
Hello.

154
00:07:18.427 --> 00:07:19.303
I know!

155
00:07:19.387 --> 00:07:20.263
Hey, wasn't I great?

156
00:07:20.347 --> 00:07:21.462
Did the whole
family see it?

157
00:07:21.547 --> 00:07:22.582
It's your mom.

158
00:07:22.667 --> 00:07:24.783
What can I say?
The camera loves me.

159
00:07:34.947 --> 00:07:36.062
( bicycle bell rings )

160
00:07:36.147 --> 00:07:37.819
I'm telling you, big daddy

161
00:07:37.907 --> 00:07:40.216
you're going to be seeing
this face on TV a lot more often.

162
00:07:40.307 --> 00:07:42.104
~Yeah? Like, on
Monstropolis's Most Wanted?

163
00:07:42.187 --> 00:07:43.302
( oocking laughter )

164
00:07:43.387 --> 00:07:44.740
You've been jealous
of my good looks

165
00:07:44.827 --> 00:07:45.862
since the
fourth grade, pal.

166
00:07:45.947 --> 00:07:47.300
Have a good day, sweetie.

167
00:07:47.387 --> 00:07:49.503
You, too, hon.

168
00:07:49.587 --> 00:07:51.418
Whoo!
Okay, Sulley, hop on in.

169
00:07:51.507 --> 00:07:52.496
Nope. Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

170
00:07:52.587 --> 00:07:53.463
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

171
00:07:53.547 --> 00:07:54.741
Where you going?
What are you doing?

172
00:07:54.827 --> 00:07:56.545
Mikey, there's a scream shortage.
We're walking.

173
00:07:56.627 --> 00:07:57.582
Walking?! Yep.

174
00:07:57.667 --> 00:07:58.543
No, no, no, my baby.

175
00:07:58.627 --> 00:07:59.503
Come on. Come on.

176
00:07:59.587 --> 00:08:00.622
Look, she needs
to be driven.

177
00:08:00.707 --> 00:08:03.096
Bye, baby.
I... I'll call you!

178
00:08:03.187 --> 00:08:04.825
MIKE:
Hey, genius,
you want to know why

179
00:08:04.907 --> 00:08:06.101
I bought the car? Huh?

180
00:08:06.187 --> 00:08:07.063
Not really.

181
00:08:07.147 --> 00:08:08.102
To drive it!

182
00:08:08.187 --> 00:08:09.506
You know, like,
on the street?

183
00:08:09.587 --> 00:08:10.815
With the honk-honk
and the vroom-vroom

184
00:08:10.907 --> 00:08:11.783
and no walking involved.

185
00:08:11.867 --> 00:08:12.743
( oock whining )

186
00:08:12.827 --> 00:08:14.180
Give it a rest,
will you, butterball?

187
00:08:14.267 --> 00:08:15.825
Come on, you could
use the exercise.

188
00:08:15.907 --> 00:08:17.135
I could use
the exercise?!

189
00:08:17.227 --> 00:08:19.263
Look at you.
You have your own climate!

190
00:08:19.347 --> 00:08:21.463
GIRL MONSTERS:
How many tentacles
jump the rope?

191
00:08:21.547 --> 00:08:23.026
BO Y MONSTER:
Morning, Mike!
Morning, Sulley!

192
00:08:23.107 --> 00:08:23.983
Hey! Morning, kids.

193
00:08:24.067 --> 00:08:24.943
Hey, kids.

194
00:08:25.027 --> 00:08:25.903
How you doing?

195
00:08:25.987 --> 00:08:27.545
Bye, Mike!
Bye, Sulley!

196
00:08:27.627 --> 00:08:29.299
BIG EYE:
Ow! Hey!

197
00:08:29.387 --> 00:08:31.264
( huooing )

198
00:08:33.947 --> 00:08:35.778
( sneezing )

199
00:08:35.867 --> 00:08:37.346
Ah, nuts.

200
00:08:37.427 --> 00:08:39.304
( singing )

201
00:08:39.387 --> 00:08:41.139
Hey, hey, hey! Fellas!

202
00:08:41.227 --> 00:08:42.103
Hey, Tony!

203
00:08:42.187 --> 00:08:44.382
Tony! Ba-da-bing!

204
00:08:44.467 --> 00:08:45.343
-Hey, Tony!
-Tony!

205
00:08:45.427 --> 00:08:46.303
Pow, pow,
pow, pow, pow!

206
00:08:46.387 --> 00:08:47.786
I hear somebody's
close to breaking

207
00:08:47.867 --> 00:08:48.743
the all-time
scare record.

208
00:08:48.827 --> 00:08:49.942
Ah, just trying
to make sure

209
00:08:50.027 --> 00:08:51.380
there's enough scream
to go around.

210
00:08:51.467 --> 00:08:52.377
( laughing )

211
00:08:52.467 --> 00:08:53.616
Hey! On the house!

212
00:08:53.707 --> 00:08:55.538
-Hey, thanks!
-Grazie!

213
00:08:55.627 --> 00:08:57.265
MIKE:
Ba-da-bing!

214
00:08:57.347 --> 00:08:58.939
( startled gasp )

215
00:08:59.027 --> 00:09:00.824
Oh, great.

216
00:09:00.907 --> 00:09:01.862
Hey, Ted!

217
00:09:01.947 --> 00:09:03.380
Good morning!

218
00:09:03.467 --> 00:09:04.582
( clucking )

219
00:09:06.427 --> 00:09:07.621
See that, Mikey?

220
00:09:07.707 --> 00:09:09.026
Ted's walking to work.

221
00:09:09.107 --> 00:09:10.256
Big deal.

222
00:09:10.347 --> 00:09:12.019
Guy takes five steps
and he's there.

223
00:09:17.827 --> 00:09:19.260
( phones ringing )

224
00:09:19.347 --> 00:09:20.905
FEMALE MONSTER:
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.

225
00:09:20.987 --> 00:09:23.103
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.

226
00:09:23.187 --> 00:09:24.063
Morning, Sulley.

227
00:09:24.147 --> 00:09:25.023
Morning, Ricky.

228
00:09:25.107 --> 00:09:25.983
Hey, it's the Sullster!

229
00:09:26.067 --> 00:09:27.102
See you on the scare floor,
buddy!

230
00:09:27.187 --> 00:09:28.256
Hey, Marge.
Hey, how was jury duty?

231
00:09:28.347 --> 00:09:29.905
Morning, Sulley!

232
00:09:29.987 --> 00:09:31.136
Hey!

233
00:09:32.187 --> 00:09:34.098
Hey, it's still
leaning to the left.

234
00:09:34.187 --> 00:09:35.176
It is not!

235
00:09:35.267 --> 00:09:36.143
Hey, fellas.

236
00:09:36.227 --> 00:09:37.103
Hey,Jerry.

237
00:09:37.187 --> 00:09:38.461
Hey, Mr Sullivan!

238
00:09:38.547 --> 00:09:41.266
Guys, I told you,
call me Sulley.

239
00:09:41.347 --> 00:09:42.223
( nervous giggling )

240
00:09:42.307 --> 00:09:43.183
I don't think so.

241
00:09:43.267 --> 00:09:45.064
We just wanted to wish
you good luck today.

242
00:09:45.147 --> 00:09:46.102
Hey. Hey, hey,
hey, hey!

243
00:09:46.187 --> 00:09:47.336
Come on, get lost,
you two.

244
00:09:47.427 --> 00:09:48.780
You're making him
lose his focus.

245
00:09:48.867 --> 00:09:49.743
Oh. Sorry.

246
00:09:49.827 --> 00:09:50.703
See you later,
fellas.

247
00:09:50.787 --> 00:09:52.505
Go get 'em,
Mr Sullivan!

248
00:09:52.587 --> 00:09:55.499
Quiet! You'll make
him lose his focus.

249
00:09:55.587 --> 00:09:56.463
Oh, no. Sorry!

250
00:09:56.547 --> 00:09:57.502
Shut up!

251
00:09:57.587 --> 00:09:59.339
-( phones ringing )
-Monsters, Inc. Please hold.

252
00:09:59.427 --> 00:10:01.463
Monsters, Inc.
I'll connect you.

253
00:10:01.547 --> 00:10:02.662
Ms Fearmonger is on vacation.

254
00:10:02.747 --> 00:10:03.862
Would you like her voice mail?

255
00:10:03.947 --> 00:10:06.541
Oh, Schmoopsie-poo.

256
00:10:06.627 --> 00:10:08.345
-( snakes squealing )
-Googley Bear!

257
00:10:08.427 --> 00:10:09.462
Happy birthday.

258
00:10:09.547 --> 00:10:12.015
Oh, Googley-woogley,
you remembered!

259
00:10:12.107 --> 00:10:13.256
Hey, Sulley-wulley.

260
00:10:13.347 --> 00:10:14.575
Oh, hey, Celia...

261
00:10:14.667 --> 00:10:15.622
weelia.

262
00:10:15.707 --> 00:10:17.299
( clears throat ):
Happy birthday.

263
00:10:17.387 --> 00:10:18.615
Thanks.

264
00:10:18.707 --> 00:10:21.505
So, uh... are we going
anywhere special tonight?

265
00:10:21.587 --> 00:10:23.862
I just got us
into a little place

266
00:10:23.947 --> 00:10:25.824
called, um...
Harryhausen's.

267
00:10:25.907 --> 00:10:26.783
( gasps )

268
00:10:26.867 --> 00:10:27.936
Harryhausen's?!

269
00:10:28.027 --> 00:10:30.063
But it's impossible to
get a reservation there!

270
00:10:30.147 --> 00:10:32.024
Not for Googley Bear.

271
00:10:32.107 --> 00:10:33.620
I will see you
at quitting time

272
00:10:33.707 --> 00:10:34.901
and not a minute later.

273
00:10:34.987 --> 00:10:35.942
Okay, sweetheart.

274
00:10:36.027 --> 00:10:37.301
Think romantical
thoughts.

275
00:10:37.387 --> 00:10:39.378
You and me

276
00:10:39.467 --> 00:10:40.695
Me and you

277
00:10:40.787 --> 00:10:43.017
Both of us together!

278
00:10:43.107 --> 00:10:45.337
You know, pal, she's the one.

279
00:10:45.427 --> 00:10:46.655
That's it.
She is the one!

280
00:10:46.747 --> 00:10:48.180
I'm happy for you.

281
00:10:48.267 --> 00:10:49.825
Oh, and, uh,
thanks for hooking me up

282
00:10:49.907 --> 00:10:51.181
with those reservations.

283
00:10:51.267 --> 00:10:53.223
Oh, no problem.
They're under the
name Googley Bear.

284
00:10:53.307 --> 00:10:54.183
Oh, good ide...

285
00:10:54.267 --> 00:10:56.337
You know,
that wasn't very funny.

286
00:10:56.427 --> 00:10:57.462
( gasps )

287
00:10:58.787 --> 00:10:59.663
What the...?

288
00:10:59.747 --> 00:11:00.623
Wazowski!

289
00:11:00.707 --> 00:11:01.583
( screaos )

290
00:11:01.667 --> 00:11:02.816
( grunts )

291
00:11:02.907 --> 00:11:03.737
( chuckling )

292
00:11:03.827 --> 00:11:04.896
What do you know?

293
00:11:04.987 --> 00:11:07.706
It scares little kids
and little monsters.

294
00:11:07.787 --> 00:11:08.697
I wasn't scared.

295
00:11:08.787 --> 00:11:11.017
I have... allergies.

296
00:11:11.107 --> 00:11:12.017
( coughing )

297
00:11:12.107 --> 00:11:13.586
Uh-huh. Sure.

298
00:11:13.667 --> 00:11:15.464
Hey, Randall, save it for
the scare floor, will you?

299
00:11:15.547 --> 00:11:16.980
I'm in the zone today,
Sullivan.

300
00:11:17.067 --> 00:11:18.864
Going to be doing
some serious scaring.

301
00:11:18.947 --> 00:11:20.380
Putting up some big numbers.

302
00:11:20.467 --> 00:11:21.502
Wow, Randall.

303
00:11:21.587 --> 00:11:22.622
That's great.

304
00:11:22.707 --> 00:11:24.220
That should make it
even more humiliating

305
00:11:24.307 --> 00:11:25.501
when we break the record first.

306
00:11:25.587 --> 00:11:26.064
Ha, ha!

307
00:11:26.147 --> 00:11:27.580
Shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh.

308
00:11:27.667 --> 00:11:28.895
Do you hear that?

309
00:11:28.987 --> 00:11:31.820
It's the winds of change.

310
00:11:33.027 --> 00:11:35.666
( oocking voice ):
''You hear it?
You hear the winds of ch...?''

311
00:11:35.747 --> 00:11:36.941
Oh, what a creep.

312
00:11:37.027 --> 00:11:39.143
One of these days,
I am really...

313
00:11:39.227 --> 00:11:41.536
going to let you
teach that guy a lesson.

314
00:11:43.827 --> 00:11:45.101
( deep croaking )

315
00:11:45.187 --> 00:11:46.461
( liquid squishing )

316
00:11:48.187 --> 00:11:50.496
Chalooby! Baby!

317
00:11:51.707 --> 00:11:53.140
MIKE:
Good morning, Roz

318
00:11:53.227 --> 00:11:55.058
my succulent
little garden snail.

319
00:11:55.147 --> 00:11:56.580
And who would
we be scaring today?

320
00:11:56.667 --> 00:12:00.740
Wazowski, you didn't file
your paperwork last night.

321
00:12:00.827 --> 00:12:02.419
Oh, that darn paperwork.

322
00:12:02.507 --> 00:12:05.943
Wouldn't it be easier
if it all just blew away?

323
00:12:06.027 --> 00:12:06.982
( chair squeaking )

324
00:12:07.067 --> 00:12:09.342
Don't let it happen again.

325
00:12:09.427 --> 00:12:10.860
Yes, well, I'll, uh...

326
00:12:10.947 --> 00:12:13.177
I'll try to be less careless.

327
00:12:13.267 --> 00:12:15.497
I'm watching you, Wazowski.

328
00:12:15.587 --> 00:12:17.464
Always watching.

329
00:12:17.547 --> 00:12:18.502
Whoo! She's nuts.

330
00:12:18.587 --> 00:12:20.339
Always!

331
00:12:20.427 --> 00:12:23.499
CELIA ( over P.A. ):
All scare floors are now active.

332
00:12:23.587 --> 00:12:26.226
Assistants, please report
to your stations.

333
00:12:26.307 --> 00:12:27.501
( oetallic clunk )

334
00:12:35.307 --> 00:12:37.537
( oachine beeps, bell dings )

335
00:12:43.627 --> 00:12:45.219
( bell dings )

336
00:13:02.187 --> 00:13:04.906
( clanking and whirring )

337
00:13:09.107 --> 00:13:10.301
( chioe rings )

338
00:13:10.387 --> 00:13:13.857
Okay, people,
eastern seaboard coming on-line.

339
00:13:13.947 --> 00:13:15.824
We got scarers coming out!

340
00:13:18.587 --> 00:13:22.102
( draoatic brass fanfare
~ playing )

341
00:13:29.227 --> 00:13:31.980
Ooh, they're
so awesome.

342
00:13:50.547 --> 00:13:52.458
( knuckles cracking )

343
00:13:52.547 --> 00:13:54.299
( clanging and growling )

344
00:13:55.587 --> 00:13:56.576
( snarls )

345
00:14:00.387 --> 00:14:01.342
( blowing )

346
00:14:01.427 --> 00:14:02.576
( growling )

347
00:14:16.347 --> 00:14:19.145
Hey... may
the best monster win.

348
00:14:19.227 --> 00:14:20.455
I plan to.

349
00:14:20.547 --> 00:14:21.582
( bell ringing )

350
00:14:21.667 --> 00:14:24.261
We are on in seven... six...

351
00:14:24.347 --> 00:14:27.976
five... four... three...

352
00:14:28.067 --> 00:14:29.978
two...

353
00:14:31.307 --> 00:14:32.422
( horn blaring )

354
00:14:32.507 --> 00:14:33.303
( growls )

355
00:14:34.587 --> 00:14:35.781
You're the boss.
You're the boss.

356
00:14:35.867 --> 00:14:36.936
You're the big,
hairy boss.

357
00:14:41.667 --> 00:14:42.895
( child screaoing )

358
00:14:44.467 --> 00:14:45.502
( bell dings )

359
00:14:45.587 --> 00:14:47.782
Oh, I'm feeling
good today, Mikey!

360
00:14:47.867 --> 00:14:48.743
Yeah!

361
00:14:48.827 --> 00:14:49.942
MIKE:
Whoa!

362
00:14:50.027 --> 00:14:51.221
Attaboy.
Attaboy.

363
00:14:51.307 --> 00:14:52.535
Another door coming right up.

364
00:14:52.627 --> 00:14:55.187
( whirring and clanking )

365
00:14:55.267 --> 00:14:56.382
( child screaoing )

366
00:14:56.467 --> 00:14:57.502
( bell dings )

367
00:14:59.267 --> 00:15:00.143
( growling )

368
00:15:00.227 --> 00:15:01.501
You're still behind,
Randall.

369
00:15:01.587 --> 00:15:03.543
You know, maybe I should
realign the scream intake valve.

370
00:15:03.627 --> 00:15:04.457
Just get me
another door!

371
00:15:04.547 --> 00:15:05.662
A door! Yes, door!

372
00:15:05.747 --> 00:15:08.102
( child screaoing )

373
00:15:08.187 --> 00:15:09.779
( bell dings )

374
00:15:09.867 --> 00:15:11.061
( bells dinging )

375
00:15:12.907 --> 00:15:15.057
( beeping )

376
00:15:15.147 --> 00:15:15.863
( oetallic clanking )

377
00:15:15.947 --> 00:15:16.777
( click and hiss )

378
00:15:16.867 --> 00:15:19.301
( children screaoing )

379
00:15:19.387 --> 00:15:21.537
( bells dinging )

380
00:15:21.627 --> 00:15:23.936
( children screaoing )

381
00:15:30.267 --> 00:15:32.497
Well,Jerry, what's
the damage so far?

382
00:15:32.587 --> 00:15:35.055
We may actually
make our quota today, sir.

383
00:15:35.147 --> 00:15:37.945
Hmm. First time
in a month.

384
00:15:38.027 --> 00:15:39.983
( gurgling and burping )

385
00:15:40.067 --> 00:15:41.500
Huh?!

386
00:15:41.587 --> 00:15:42.736
( door buzzing )

387
00:15:42.827 --> 00:15:44.658
( screaoing and sobbing )

388
00:15:44.747 --> 00:15:46.100
What happened?

389
00:15:46.187 --> 00:15:47.256
The kid almost
touched me!

390
00:15:47.347 --> 00:15:48.541
She got this close
to me!

391
00:15:48.627 --> 00:15:49.901
She wasn't
scared of you?

392
00:15:49.987 --> 00:15:51.022
She was only six!

393
00:15:51.107 --> 00:15:52.381
I could've been dead!

394
00:15:52.467 --> 00:15:54.298
I could've died!

395
00:15:54.387 --> 00:15:56.423
Keep it together, man.

396
00:15:56.507 --> 00:15:57.496
( whistling )

397
00:15:57.587 --> 00:15:59.066
Hey! We got a dead
door over here!

398
00:15:59.147 --> 00:16:00.421
-We're coming!
-Coming!

399
00:16:00.507 --> 00:16:02.099
-Look out!
-Out of the way!

400
00:16:02.187 --> 00:16:03.984
-Coming through!
-Excuse us.

401
00:16:04.067 --> 00:16:06.456
( whiopering )

402
00:16:06.547 --> 00:16:09.015
We've lost 58 doors
this week, sir.

403
00:16:09.107 --> 00:16:10.938
Oh, kids these days.

404
00:16:11.027 --> 00:16:13.336
They just don't get
scared like they used to.

405
00:16:13.427 --> 00:16:15.338
Let her rip!

406
00:16:15.427 --> 00:16:18.146
( buzzing )

407
00:16:20.107 --> 00:16:22.257
( oetallic clank )

408
00:16:22.347 --> 00:16:24.815
( eerie blubbering )

409
00:16:24.907 --> 00:16:25.783
( child screaoing )

410
00:16:25.867 --> 00:16:26.743
( bell dings )

411
00:16:26.827 --> 00:16:27.703
Uh, sir?

412
00:16:27.787 --> 00:16:28.663
What?!

413
00:16:28.747 --> 00:16:30.146
Look.

414
00:16:30.227 --> 00:16:32.297
CELIA ( over P.A. ):
Attention.

415
00:16:32.387 --> 00:16:34.298
We have a new scare leader:
Randall Boggs.

416
00:16:34.387 --> 00:16:35.456
( snickering )

417
00:16:35.547 --> 00:16:37.981
( assistants cheering )

418
00:16:38.067 --> 00:16:40.945
( children screaoing )

419
00:16:42.787 --> 00:16:43.902
( knuckles cracking )

420
00:16:43.987 --> 00:16:44.817
Slumber party.

421
00:16:44.907 --> 00:16:45.783
( laughing )

422
00:16:45.867 --> 00:16:46.822
Whoo!

423
00:16:46.907 --> 00:16:48.420
( beeping )

424
00:16:48.507 --> 00:16:49.986
CELIA ( over P.A. ):
Never mind.

425
00:16:50.067 --> 00:16:51.705
Hey! Watch it!

426
00:16:51.787 --> 00:16:54.017
( Sulley laughing )

427
00:16:54.107 --> 00:16:56.826
Well,James, that was
an impressive display!

428
00:16:56.907 --> 00:16:58.784
Oh, just doing my job,
Mr Waternoose.

429
00:16:58.867 --> 00:17:00.778
Of course, I did
learn from the best.

430
00:17:00.867 --> 00:17:01.982
( both laughing )

431
00:17:02.067 --> 00:17:05.184
If I don't see a new door at
my station in five seconds

432
00:17:05.267 --> 00:17:07.940
I will personally
put you through the shredder!

433
00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:08.777
( screaos )

434
00:17:09.011 --> 00:17:11.605
Hey, Wazowski, nice job!

435
00:17:11.691 --> 00:17:13.124
Those numbers
are pretty sweet.

436
00:17:13.211 --> 00:17:14.405
Are they?

437
00:17:14.491 --> 00:17:15.844
You know,
I hadn't even noticed.

438
00:17:15.931 --> 00:17:17.284
And, uh...
how is Georgie doing?

439
00:17:17.371 --> 00:17:18.440
He's doing great!

440
00:17:18.531 --> 00:17:19.805
I love working
with that big guy.

441
00:17:19.891 --> 00:17:20.801
( child screaoing )

442
00:17:20.891 --> 00:17:21.926
Keep the doors coming,
Charlie.

443
00:17:22.011 --> 00:17:23.046
I'm on a roll today.

444
00:17:23.131 --> 00:17:24.769
George and I
are like brothers.

445
00:17:24.851 --> 00:17:25.727
( gasping )

446
00:17:25.811 --> 00:17:28.325
231 9!

447
00:17:28.411 --> 00:17:30.322
( gasping )

448
00:17:32.451 --> 00:17:33.770
( alaro blaring )

449
00:17:33.851 --> 00:17:35.967
COMPUTER VOICE ( over P.A. ):
Red alert! Red alert!

450
00:17:36.051 --> 00:17:37.370
Red alert! Red alert! Red alert!

451
00:17:37.451 --> 00:17:38.884
FEMALE ( over P.A. ):
George Sanderson

452
00:17:38.971 --> 00:17:40.563
please remain motionless.

453
00:17:40.651 --> 00:17:41.800
Prepare for decontamination.

454
00:17:41.891 --> 00:17:43.040
Get it off!

455
00:17:43.131 --> 00:17:44.723
JERRY:
Duck and cover, people!

456
00:17:47.291 --> 00:17:49.680
Oh, not the CD A.

457
00:17:52.811 --> 00:17:54.722
( siren wailing )

458
00:17:57.451 --> 00:17:58.406
CD A AGENT:
Move! Move! Move!

459
00:17:58.491 --> 00:17:59.970
Coming through, please.
Stand aside.

460
00:18:00.051 --> 00:18:01.120
CD A AGENT 2:
Clear the contaminated area.

461
00:18:01.211 --> 00:18:02.200
( screaos )

462
00:18:02.291 --> 00:18:03.929
CD A AGENT:
This is a 231 9 in progress.

463
00:18:04.011 --> 00:18:04.887
Keep the area clear.

464
00:18:04.971 --> 00:18:06.040
Coming through.
Watch yourself.

465
00:18:06.131 --> 00:18:07.166
( grunts )

466
00:18:07.251 --> 00:18:08.570
( whiopering )

467
00:18:10.011 --> 00:18:11.285
Stand back.

468
00:18:11.371 --> 00:18:13.168
Careful.

469
00:18:13.251 --> 00:18:14.525
( oetallic clang )

470
00:18:14.611 --> 00:18:15.805
( drills whirring )

471
00:18:20.091 --> 00:18:20.841
( all gasping )

472
00:18:20.931 --> 00:18:22.967
( ouffled explosion )

473
00:18:24.211 --> 00:18:26.361
( drills whirring )

474
00:18:26.451 --> 00:18:27.645
All clear.

475
00:18:27.731 --> 00:18:29.244
Situation is niner-niner-zero.

476
00:18:29.331 --> 00:18:30.764
Ready for decon.

477
00:18:30.851 --> 00:18:31.886
Hey, thanks, guys.

478
00:18:31.971 --> 00:18:33.040
That was a close one.

479
00:18:33.131 --> 00:18:34.484
Okay.

480
00:18:34.571 --> 00:18:36.402
( shears buzzing )

481
00:18:36.491 --> 00:18:38.049
( screaoing )

482
00:18:38.131 --> 00:18:39.962
( whiopering )

483
00:18:40.051 --> 00:18:41.882
( ripping )

484
00:18:41.971 --> 00:18:43.927
( screaoing )

485
00:18:44.011 --> 00:18:46.479
JERRY:
Okay, people, take a break!

486
00:18:46.571 --> 00:18:47.845
We got to shut down
for a half-hour

487
00:18:47.931 --> 00:18:48.920
and reset the system.

488
00:18:49.011 --> 00:18:51.445
An entire scare floor
out of commission.

489
00:18:51.531 --> 00:18:53.203
What else can go wrong?

490
00:18:54.731 --> 00:18:57.040
Oh... what a day.

491
00:18:57.131 --> 00:18:58.803
We're just going through
a rough time, sir.

492
00:18:58.891 --> 00:19:00.927
Everyone knows you're going
to get us through it.

493
00:19:01.011 --> 00:19:02.808
Tell that to the
board of directors.

494
00:19:02.891 --> 00:19:04.324
( slurping )

495
00:19:04.411 --> 00:19:05.924
James, this company

496
00:19:06.011 --> 00:19:08.650
has been in my family
for three generations.

497
00:19:08.731 --> 00:19:11.689
I would do anything to
keep it from going under.

498
00:19:11.771 --> 00:19:12.965
Oh, so would I, sir.

499
00:19:13.051 --> 00:19:14.404
Well...

500
00:19:14.491 --> 00:19:17.085
Say, I could use your help
with something.

501
00:19:17.171 --> 00:19:18.570
Anything, sir.

502
00:19:18.651 --> 00:19:20.642
You see, we've hired
some new scare recruits

503
00:19:20.731 --> 00:19:22.562
and frankly, they're...
they're, um... uh...

504
00:19:22.651 --> 00:19:24.084
Inexperienced?

505
00:19:24.171 --> 00:19:25.570
Oh, they stink!

506
00:19:25.651 --> 00:19:26.845
Uh-huh.

507
00:19:26.931 --> 00:19:28.728
And I thought maybe
you might come by tomorrow

508
00:19:28.811 --> 00:19:30.244
and give them a demonstration.

509
00:19:30.331 --> 00:19:33.289
Show them what it takes
to be a top scarer, huh?

510
00:19:33.371 --> 00:19:36.329
I'll start out with the old
Waternoose jump-and-growl.

511
00:19:36.411 --> 00:19:37.924
( growling loudly )

512
00:19:38.011 --> 00:19:39.808
Ha! Oh, oh, yes!

513
00:19:39.891 --> 00:19:41.165
Now, that's my boy!

514
00:19:41.251 --> 00:19:42.479
( both laughing )

515
00:19:44.091 --> 00:19:46.400
( ringing )

516
00:19:47.811 --> 00:19:49.369
JERRY:
Let's go, everybody!

517
00:19:49.451 --> 00:19:50.725
All doors must be returned!

518
00:19:50.811 --> 00:19:52.403
No exceptions!

519
00:19:56.931 --> 00:19:57.920
-Whoo!
-Oh, yeah.

520
00:19:58.011 --> 00:19:59.763
I've never seen anything
like you today.

521
00:19:59.851 --> 00:20:01.079
You were on
a roll, my man.

522
00:20:01.171 --> 00:20:02.047
Another day like this

523
00:20:02.131 --> 00:20:03.246
and that scare record's
in the bag.

524
00:20:03.331 --> 00:20:04.286
That's right, baby!

525
00:20:04.371 --> 00:20:05.360
Uh-huh.

526
00:20:09.251 --> 00:20:10.730
So get this--
as if dinner wasn't enough

527
00:20:10.811 --> 00:20:12.802
I'm taking her to
a monster truck rally afterwards.

528
00:20:12.891 --> 00:20:13.767
Nice.

529
00:20:13.851 --> 00:20:15.045
What's on your agenda?

530
00:20:15.131 --> 00:20:16.644
I'm going to head home
and work out some more.

531
00:20:16.731 --> 00:20:18.642
Again? You know, there's
more to life than scaring.

532
00:20:18.731 --> 00:20:19.686
( sniffing )

533
00:20:19.771 --> 00:20:21.045
Whew. Hey, can I
borrow your odorant?

534
00:20:21.131 --> 00:20:22.484
Yeah. I got, uh...

535
00:20:22.571 --> 00:20:25.324
smelly garbage or old dumpster.

536
00:20:25.411 --> 00:20:26.526
You got low tide?

537
00:20:26.611 --> 00:20:27.487
No.

538
00:20:27.571 --> 00:20:28.447
How about wet dog?

539
00:20:28.531 --> 00:20:29.486
Yep. Stink it up.

540
00:20:30.971 --> 00:20:31.847
( growling )

541
00:20:31.931 --> 00:20:33.159
You know, I am so romantic

542
00:20:33.251 --> 00:20:34.809
sometimes I think
I should just marry myself.

543
00:20:34.891 --> 00:20:36.119
Give me a break,
Mike.

544
00:20:36.211 --> 00:20:38.645
What a night of romance
I got ahead of me.

545
00:20:38.731 --> 00:20:39.880
Tonight is about me

546
00:20:39.971 --> 00:20:41.643
and Celia.

547
00:20:41.731 --> 00:20:44.245
Ooh, the love boat
is about to set sail.

548
00:20:44.331 --> 00:20:45.161
( ioitating ship horn )

549
00:20:45.251 --> 00:20:46.366
'Cause I got
to tell you, buddy

550
00:20:46.451 --> 00:20:48.487
that face of hers,
it just makes my heart go...

551
00:20:48.571 --> 00:20:49.447
Yikes!

552
00:20:49.531 --> 00:20:50.600
Hello, Wazowski.

553
00:20:50.691 --> 00:20:53.364
Fun-filled evening
planned for tonight?

554
00:20:53.451 --> 00:20:55.123
Well, as a
matter of fact...

555
00:20:55.211 --> 00:20:57.566
Then I'm sure you
filed your paperwork

556
00:20:57.651 --> 00:20:59.642
correctly... for once.

557
00:21:00.771 --> 00:21:04.286
Your stunned silence
is very reassuring.

558
00:21:04.371 --> 00:21:06.202
Oh, no. My scare reports--
I left them on my desk

559
00:21:06.291 --> 00:21:08.168
and if I'm not at
the restaurant in five minutes

560
00:21:08.251 --> 00:21:09.320
they're going to give
our table away!

561
00:21:09.411 --> 00:21:10.287
What am I going to tell...

562
00:21:10.371 --> 00:21:11.247
Schmoopsie-poo.

563
00:21:11.331 --> 00:21:12.764
Hey, Googley Bear.
Want to get going?

564
00:21:12.851 --> 00:21:13.886
Do I ever!
It's just that...

565
00:21:13.971 --> 00:21:15.006
What?

566
00:21:15.091 --> 00:21:16.001
Uh, you know,
there's a small....

567
00:21:16.091 --> 00:21:17.285
I don't understand.

568
00:21:17.371 --> 00:21:19.009
It's just that I forgot
about some paperwork

569
00:21:19.091 --> 00:21:20.160
I was supposed to file.

570
00:21:20.251 --> 00:21:21.730
Mike was reminding me.

571
00:21:21.811 --> 00:21:22.766
Thanks, buddy.

572
00:21:22.851 --> 00:21:23.886
Whoo.

573
00:21:23.971 --> 00:21:25.324
I was? I mean, I was!
Yeah, I was.

574
00:21:25.411 --> 00:21:26.605
Oh, okay.
Let's go then.

575
00:21:26.691 --> 00:21:27.567
We're going!

576
00:21:27.651 --> 00:21:28.527
On my desk, Sulley.

577
00:21:28.611 --> 00:21:29.805
The pink copies
go to Accounting

578
00:21:29.891 --> 00:21:31.119
the fuchsia ones
go to Purchasing

579
00:21:31.211 --> 00:21:32.326
and goldenrod ones
go to Roz.

580
00:21:32.411 --> 00:21:33.287
Huh!

581
00:21:33.371 --> 00:21:34.406
Leave the puce.

582
00:21:37.211 --> 00:21:40.009
SULLEY:
Pink copies go to Accounting,
the fuchsia ones go to Roz.

583
00:21:40.091 --> 00:21:42.082
No, fuchsia ones
go to Purchasing.

584
00:21:42.171 --> 00:21:43.923
The goldenrod ones go to Roz.

585
00:21:44.011 --> 00:21:46.605
Man, I have no idea
what puce is.

586
00:21:49.611 --> 00:21:51.602
Oh, that's puce.

587
00:21:51.691 --> 00:21:54.922
Hmm?

588
00:21:55.011 --> 00:21:57.684
Uh, hello?

589
00:21:57.771 --> 00:21:59.887
Anyone?

590
00:21:59.971 --> 00:22:02.121
There's a door here.

591
00:22:02.211 --> 00:22:03.166
Hmm.

592
00:22:15.131 --> 00:22:17.201

Hello?

595
00:22:21.971 --> 00:22:22.847
Hey.

596
00:22:22.931 --> 00:22:23.807
Psst.

597
00:22:23.891 --> 00:22:25.483
Anybody scaring in here?

598
00:22:25.571 --> 00:22:27.402
Hello?

599
00:22:27.491 --> 00:22:28.446
Yo!

600
00:22:34.771 --> 00:22:36.727
Hmm.

601

609
00:22:53.531 --> 00:22:54.600
Gotcha!

612
00:22:58.571 --> 00:22:59.526
Eh!

( loud crashing, toy squeaking )

622
00:23:15.011 --> 00:23:16.285
Yeow!

623
00:23:17.371 --> 00:23:18.326

640
00:24:17.971 --> 00:24:18.881
No, no-- stay back.

642
00:24:22.051 --> 00:24:23.120

( laughing )

660
00:25:30.491 --> 00:25:32.846
Oh, Michael, I've had
a lot of birthday...

661
00:25:32.931 --> 00:25:34.444
well, not a
lot of birthdays

662
00:25:34.531 --> 00:25:36.522
but this is the
best birthday ever.

663
00:25:36.611 --> 00:25:37.487
Hmm.

664
00:25:37.571 --> 00:25:39.607
What are you
looking at?

665
00:25:39.691 --> 00:25:40.680
I was just thinking

666
00:25:40.771 --> 00:25:42.602
about the first time
I laid eye on you--

667
00:25:42.691 --> 00:25:43.646
how pretty you looked.

668
00:25:43.731 --> 00:25:44.766
Stop it!

669
00:25:44.851 --> 00:25:46.000
Your hair was
shorter then.

670
00:25:46.091 --> 00:25:47.490
Mm-hmm. I'm thinking
about getting it cut.

671
00:25:47.571 --> 00:25:48.447
( faint squeal of fear )

672
00:25:48.531 --> 00:25:49.600
No, no, I like
it this length.

673
00:25:49.691 --> 00:25:50.567
( sighs of relief )

674
00:25:50.651 --> 00:25:52.050
I like everything
about you.

675
00:25:52.131 --> 00:25:53.041
Just the other day

676
00:25:53.131 --> 00:25:54.450
someone asked me
who I thought

677
00:25:54.531 --> 00:25:56.328
the most beautiful monster was
in all of Monstropolis.

678
00:25:56.411 --> 00:25:57.287
You know what I said?

679
00:25:57.371 --> 00:25:58.645
What did you say?

680
00:25:58.731 --> 00:25:59.607
I said...

681
00:25:59.691 --> 00:26:00.726
Sulley?

682
00:26:00.811 --> 00:26:02.039
Sulley?

683
00:26:02.131 --> 00:26:03.086
No! No, no.

684
00:26:03.171 --> 00:26:04.399
That's not
what I was going to say.

685
00:26:04.491 --> 00:26:05.844
Mike, you're not making sense.

686
00:26:05.931 --> 00:26:07.523
SULLEY:
Hi, guys!

687
00:26:07.611 --> 00:26:08.930
What a coincidence,
running into you here!

688
00:26:09.011 --> 00:26:10.444
Uh, I'm just going
to order something to go.

689
00:26:10.531 --> 00:26:11.407
Michael...

690
00:26:11.491 --> 00:26:12.367
Sulley!

691
00:26:12.451 --> 00:26:13.486
I wonder what's good here.

692
00:26:13.571 --> 00:26:14.924
Get out of here.
You're ruining everything.

693
00:26:15.011 --> 00:26:16.046
I went back to get
your paperwork

694
00:26:16.131 --> 00:26:17.007
and there was a door.

695
00:26:17.091 --> 00:26:18.046
What?

696
00:26:19.411 --> 00:26:20.924
( rattling )

697
00:26:21.011 --> 00:26:21.887
A door?!

698
00:26:21.971 --> 00:26:22.847
Randall was in it.

699
00:26:22.931 --> 00:26:23.841
Wait a minute.
Randall?

700
00:26:23.931 --> 00:26:24.841
That cheater!

701
00:26:24.931 --> 00:26:26.603
He's trying
to boost his numbers!

702
00:26:26.691 --> 00:26:27.919
There's something else.

703
00:26:28.011 --> 00:26:28.887
What?!

704
00:26:28.971 --> 00:26:30.086
Ook-lay in the ag-bay.

705
00:26:30.171 --> 00:26:31.047
What?!

706
00:26:31.131 --> 00:26:32.200
Look in the bag.

707
00:26:32.291 --> 00:26:33.929
What bag?

708
00:26:34.011 --> 00:26:36.127
( sighs )

709
00:26:37.171 --> 00:26:38.889
( gasps )

710
00:26:38.971 --> 00:26:40.563
( giggling )

711
00:26:40.651 --> 00:26:41.766
Oh!

712
00:26:41.851 --> 00:26:42.920
They don't have
anything I like here.

713
00:26:43.011 --> 00:26:43.966
So take care, Celia!

714
00:26:44.051 --> 00:26:44.881
Excuse me, sir.

715
00:26:44.971 --> 00:26:45.847
What's going on?

716
00:26:45.931 --> 00:26:47.364
Celia, please try
to understand.

717
00:26:48.611 --> 00:26:50.124
I have to do something!

718
00:26:50.211 --> 00:26:51.087

720
00:26:52.731 --> 00:26:53.846

There's a kid here--
a human kid!

( exclaioing in baby talk )

729

CD A HELICOPTER PILOT:
Please remain calm.

737

This is not a drill.

738
00:27:29.331 --> 00:27:31.049
( siren wailing,
~ tyres screeching )

739
00:27:31.131 --> 00:27:33.008
CD A AGENT:
We have an 835 in progress.

740
00:27:33.091 --> 00:27:33.921
Please advise.

741
00:27:34.011 --> 00:27:36.206
Michael? Michael?

742
00:27:36.291 --> 00:27:37.280
Oh, Celia.

743
00:27:37.371 --> 00:27:38.850
-Please come with me.
-Ow. Stop pushing.

744
00:27:38.931 --> 00:27:40.728
Hey, get your hands off
my Schmoopsie-poo!

745
00:27:40.811 --> 00:27:43.006
Building clear.
Ready for decontamination.

746
00:27:43.091 --> 00:27:45.924
Well, I don't think that date
could have gone any worse.

747
00:27:46.011 --> 00:27:46.966
( explosion )

748
00:27:47.051 --> 00:27:48.689
( electrical buzzing )

749
00:27:52.491 --> 00:27:54.243
If witnesses are to be believed

750
00:27:54.331 --> 00:27:56.367
there has been
a child security breach

751
00:27:56.451 --> 00:27:58.601
for the first time
in monster history.

752
00:27:58.691 --> 00:28:00.010
We can neither confirm nor deny

753
00:28:00.091 --> 00:28:02.082
the presence of
a human child here tonight.

754
00:28:02.171 --> 00:28:03.809
Well, a kid flew right over me

755
00:28:03.891 --> 00:28:06.041
and blasted a car
with its laser vision!

756
00:28:06.131 --> 00:28:08.281
I tried to run from it,
but it picked me up

757
00:28:08.371 --> 00:28:10.760
with its mind powers
and shook me like a doll!

758
00:28:10.851 --> 00:28:12.648
It's true!
I saw the whole thing!

759
00:28:12.731 --> 00:28:15.199
It is my
professional opinion

760
00:28:15.291 --> 00:28:18.089
that now is the time
to... panic!

761
00:28:18.171 --> 00:28:19.365
Oh-oh.

762
00:28:19.451 --> 00:28:21.442
( both yelling )

763
00:28:21.531 --> 00:28:22.646
Oh, it's coming!

764
00:28:22.731 --> 00:28:23.880
It's coming!

765
00:28:23.971 --> 00:28:25.723
( giggling ):
Boo!

766
00:28:25.811 --> 00:28:26.926
( both screaoing )

767
00:28:27.011 --> 00:28:28.842
( distant sirens wailing )

768
00:28:29.891 --> 00:28:31.404
( delighted cry )

769
00:28:31.491 --> 00:28:33.129
( yelling )

770
00:28:33.211 --> 00:28:34.610
No, no, no, no, no!

771
00:28:34.691 --> 00:28:35.806
Come here, kid.

772
00:28:35.891 --> 00:28:36.846
Whee.

773
00:28:38.971 --> 00:28:40.370
No, don't touch those,
you little...!

774
00:28:40.451 --> 00:28:41.327
Oh, now

775
00:28:41.411 --> 00:28:42.446
those were alphabetized.

776
00:28:42.531 --> 00:28:43.520
It's okay, it's all right.

777
00:28:43.611 --> 00:28:44.805
As long as it doesn't
come near us

778
00:28:44.891 --> 00:28:45.767
we're going to be okay.

779
00:28:45.851 --> 00:28:46.727
( sneezes )

780
00:28:46.811 --> 00:28:47.960
( screaos )

781
00:28:48.691 --> 00:28:49.919
( yelling in pain )

782
00:28:50.011 --> 00:28:51.239
( whiopering in fear )

783
00:28:51.331 --> 00:28:52.446
Wanna ride on it!

784
00:28:53.931 --> 00:28:54.568
Da, da-da.

785
00:28:54.651 --> 00:28:55.527
Da-da-da.

786
00:28:55.611 --> 00:28:56.646
Oh, y-you like this?

787
00:28:56.731 --> 00:28:57.561
Fetch!

788
00:28:57.651 --> 00:28:58.527
( giggles )

789
00:28:58.611 --> 00:29:00.090
( gasps )

790
00:29:00.171 --> 00:29:01.490
Hey, hey, that's it!

791
00:29:01.571 --> 00:29:03.402
No one touches
little Mikey!

792
00:29:03.491 --> 00:29:05.209
( whining )

793
00:29:05.291 --> 00:29:07.168
Mike, give her the bear.

794
00:29:08.811 --> 00:29:09.687
Oh, no.

795
00:29:09.771 --> 00:29:11.523
( piercing screao )

796
00:29:11.611 --> 00:29:12.964
( electrical buzzing )

797
00:29:14.611 --> 00:29:17.364
( screaoing and crying
~ continue )

798
00:29:17.451 --> 00:29:20.329
( buzzing continues )

799
00:29:22.611 --> 00:29:23.521
( exclaioing in fear )

800
00:29:23.611 --> 00:29:24.805
Make it stop, Sulley!

801
00:29:24.891 --> 00:29:25.960
Make it stop!

802
00:29:26.051 --> 00:29:27.200
Look!
See the bear?

803
00:29:27.291 --> 00:29:28.280
Ooh, nice bear.

804
00:29:28.371 --> 00:29:29.406
( screaos )

805
00:29:29.491 --> 00:29:30.526
Sulley!

806
00:29:30.611 --> 00:29:31.600
See?

807
00:29:31.691 --> 00:29:32.680
Ooh, bear, ooh.

808
00:29:32.771 --> 00:29:34.443
Oh, he's
a happy bear.

809
00:29:34.531 --> 00:29:36.044
He's not crying,
neither should you

810
00:29:36.131 --> 00:29:37.405
Or we'll be in trouble

811
00:29:37.491 --> 00:29:38.480
'Cause they're gonna find us

812
00:29:38.571 --> 00:29:40.562
So please stop crying

813
00:29:40.651 --> 00:29:41.686
Right now.

814
00:29:41.771 --> 00:29:42.760
Good, good, Sulley.
Keep it up.

815
00:29:42.851 --> 00:29:44.045
You're doing great.

816
00:29:44.131 --> 00:29:45.280
Ooh, the happy bear,
he has no...

817
00:29:45.371 --> 00:29:46.520
( screaoing )

818
00:29:46.611 --> 00:29:47.839
She touched me!

819
00:29:47.931 --> 00:29:48.841
Sulley, the bear!

820
00:29:48.931 --> 00:29:49.807
The bear!

821
00:29:49.891 --> 00:29:50.801
Give her the...

822
00:29:50.891 --> 00:29:52.370
Whoa!

823
00:29:54.811 --> 00:29:56.164
( giggles )

824
00:29:56.251 --> 00:29:57.479
( screaoing with laughter )

825
00:29:57.571 --> 00:29:59.323
( electrical buzzing
~ grows louder )

826
00:29:59.411 --> 00:30:00.366
( light bulb shatters )

827
00:30:00.451 --> 00:30:01.361
( giggles )

828
00:30:01.451 --> 00:30:03.009
What was that?

829
00:30:03.091 --> 00:30:04.001
( thuoping )

830
00:30:04.091 --> 00:30:04.967
I have no idea

831
00:30:05.051 --> 00:30:06.769
but it would be
really great

832
00:30:06.851 --> 00:30:08.284
if it didn't
do it again.

833
00:30:08.371 --> 00:30:09.486
( giggles )

834
00:30:09.571 --> 00:30:10.845
Shh, shh, shh.

835
00:30:10.931 --> 00:30:12.000
Shh...

836
00:30:12.091 --> 00:30:13.206
Shh.

837
00:30:13.291 --> 00:30:14.883
Shh...

838
00:30:23.491 --> 00:30:24.719
Ah!

839
00:30:28.091 --> 00:30:29.160
How could I do this?

840
00:30:29.251 --> 00:30:30.684
How could I be so stupid?

841
00:30:30.771 --> 00:30:32.250
This could destroy
the company.

842
00:30:32.331 --> 00:30:33.207
The company?

843
00:30:33.291 --> 00:30:34.610
Who cares
about the company?!

844
00:30:34.691 --> 00:30:35.567
What about us?

845
00:30:35.651 --> 00:30:37.084
That thing is
a killing machine!

846
00:30:37.171 --> 00:30:39.207
La-la-la-la-la-la

847
00:30:39.291 --> 00:30:41.088
I bet it's just waiting
for us to fall asleep

848
00:30:41.171 --> 00:30:42.206
and then wham!

849
00:30:42.291 --> 00:30:43.963
Oh, we're easy prey,
my friend-- easy prey.

850
00:30:44.051 --> 00:30:45.848
We're sitting targets.

851
00:30:45.931 --> 00:30:46.761
Okay, look, I think

852
00:30:46.851 --> 00:30:48.125
I have a plan here.

853
00:30:48.211 --> 00:30:51.283
Using mainly spoons, we dig
a tunnel under the city

854
00:30:51.371 --> 00:30:53.168
and release it into the wild.

855
00:30:53.251 --> 00:30:55.242
Spoons.

856
00:30:55.331 --> 00:30:56.684
That's it, I'm out of ideas.

857
00:30:56.771 --> 00:30:58.124
We're closed.
Hot air balloon?

858
00:30:58.211 --> 00:30:59.803
Too expensive.
Giant slingshot?

859
00:30:59.891 --> 00:31:00.767
Too conspicuous.

860
00:31:00.851 --> 00:31:01.886
Enormous wooden horse?
Too Greek!

861
00:31:01.971 --> 00:31:05.043
( speaking baby talk )

862
00:31:05.131 --> 00:31:07.087
No plan. No plan.

863
00:31:07.171 --> 00:31:09.401
Can't think.
Can't think.

864
00:31:09.491 --> 00:31:10.446
Flatlining.

865
00:31:10.531 --> 00:31:11.407
Uh, Mike?

866
00:31:11.491 --> 00:31:13.607
I think she's getting tired.

867
00:31:13.691 --> 00:31:15.443
Well, then
why don't you

868
00:31:15.531 --> 00:31:17.920
find someplace
for it to sleep?

869
00:31:18.011 --> 00:31:19.524
While I think of a plan!

870
00:31:21.051 --> 00:31:22.643
Are you sleepy?

871
00:31:22.731 --> 00:31:24.642
You want to sleep?

872
00:31:24.731 --> 00:31:25.720
Is that what you want?

873
00:31:25.811 --> 00:31:27.130
Huh?

874
00:31:35.051 --> 00:31:38.930
( crunching )

875
00:31:39.011 --> 00:31:40.046
Okay, all right.

876
00:31:40.131 --> 00:31:41.644
I'm making a nice
little area for you to...

877
00:31:41.731 --> 00:31:42.766
( giggling )

878
00:31:42.851 --> 00:31:44.569
No. Hey, hey,
that's my bed!

879
00:31:44.651 --> 00:31:46.004
You're going to get
your germs all over it.

880
00:31:48.131 --> 00:31:49.086
( sighing ):
Fine.

881
00:31:49.171 --> 00:31:51.446
My chair is
more comfortable anyway.

882
00:31:51.531 --> 00:31:52.759
( yells )

883
00:31:52.851 --> 00:31:53.727
What?

884
00:31:53.811 --> 00:31:54.960
( speaking fearfully )

885
00:31:56.651 --> 00:31:57.527
It's just a closet.

886
00:31:57.611 --> 00:31:58.680
Will you go to sleep?

887
00:32:02.331 --> 00:32:04.083
Hey, that looks like Randall.

888
00:32:04.171 --> 00:32:06.446
Randall's your monster.

889
00:32:06.531 --> 00:32:09.443
You think he's going
to come through the closet

890
00:32:09.531 --> 00:32:10.407
and scare you.

891
00:32:10.491 --> 00:32:12.402
Oh, boy,
how do I explain this?

892
00:32:12.491 --> 00:32:13.401
Uh, it's empty.

893
00:32:13.491 --> 00:32:14.765
-See?
-Ah!

894
00:32:14.851 --> 00:32:16.523
No monster in here.

895
00:32:19.971 --> 00:32:21.370
Well, now there is

896
00:32:21.451 --> 00:32:23.965
but I'm not going to scare you.

897
00:32:24.051 --> 00:32:25.120
I'm off-duty.

898
00:32:28.931 --> 00:32:30.159
Okay.

899
00:32:30.251 --> 00:32:34.529
How about I sit here,
until you fall asleep?

900
00:32:36.531 --> 00:32:37.646
Go ahead.

901
00:32:37.731 --> 00:32:39.050
Go to sleep.

902
00:32:39.131 --> 00:32:40.007
Now.

903
00:32:40.091 --> 00:32:42.889
Now... go.

904
00:32:42.971 --> 00:32:44.165
Uh, you...

905
00:32:44.251 --> 00:32:45.400
go...

906
00:32:45.491 --> 00:32:46.480
to...

907
00:32:46.571 --> 00:32:47.560
sleep.

908
00:32:47.651 --> 00:32:49.130
( ioitating snoring )

909
00:32:49.211 --> 00:32:50.564
( giggles )

910
00:32:53.931 --> 00:32:55.649
( sighs in relief )

911
00:33:11.891 --> 00:33:14.246
( door creaks softly )

912
00:33:19.811 --> 00:33:21.324
Hey, Mike,
this might sound crazy

913
00:33:21.411 --> 00:33:23.447
but I don't think
that kid's dangerous.

914
00:33:23.531 --> 00:33:25.601
Really? Well, in that case,
let's keep it.

915
00:33:25.691 --> 00:33:27.568
I always wanted a pet
that could kill me!

916
00:33:27.651 --> 00:33:28.800
Now, look.

917
00:33:28.891 --> 00:33:30.563
What if we just put
her back in her door?

918
00:33:30.651 --> 00:33:32.004
What?

919
00:33:32.091 --> 00:33:33.001
Mike, think about it.

920
00:33:33.091 --> 00:33:34.524
If we send her back,
it's like it never happened.

921
00:33:34.611 --> 00:33:35.600
Everything goes back to normal.

922
00:33:35.691 --> 00:33:36.567
Is that a joke?

923
00:33:36.651 --> 00:33:37.686
Tell me you're joking.

924
00:33:39.291 --> 00:33:41.566
Sulley, I'd like to think
that, given the circumstances

925
00:33:41.651 --> 00:33:43.289
I have been extremely
forgiving up to now

926
00:33:43.371 --> 00:33:44.520
but that is a horrible idea!

927
00:33:44.611 --> 00:33:45.805
What are we going to do?

928
00:33:45.891 --> 00:33:47.643
March right out into
public with that thing?

929
00:33:47.731 --> 00:33:50.120
Then I guess we just waltz
right up to the factory, right?

930
00:33:50.295 --> 00:33:53.287
I can't believe we
are waltzing right
up to the factory.

931
00:33:53.375 --> 00:33:56.333
Sulley, a mop,
a couple of lights
and some chair fabric

932
00:33:56.415 --> 00:33:57.973
are not going
to fool anyone!

933
00:33:58.055 --> 00:34:00.171
Just think about
a few names, will you?

934
00:34:00.255 --> 00:34:02.371
Loch Ness, Bigfoot,
the Abominable Snowman--

935
00:34:02.455 --> 00:34:04.969
they all got one thing
in common, pal-- banishment.

936
00:34:05.055 --> 00:34:06.329
We could be next!

937
00:34:06.415 --> 00:34:07.530
Don't panic--
we can do this.

938
00:34:07.615 --> 00:34:08.650
Hey, how you doing, Frank?

939
00:34:08.735 --> 00:34:09.645
Hey, guys.

940
00:34:09.735 --> 00:34:10.770
Everything's going

941
00:34:10.855 --> 00:34:12.004
to be okay.

942
00:34:12.095 --> 00:34:13.005
( gasping )

943
00:34:13.095 --> 00:34:15.006
( equipoent buzzing loudly )

944
00:34:16.775 --> 00:34:18.367
Number One wants this place
dusted for prints.

945
00:34:18.455 --> 00:34:19.604
Careful with that.

946
00:34:19.695 --> 00:34:21.014
I got a good view from here.

947
00:34:21.095 --> 00:34:22.653
A little lower.

948
00:34:22.735 --> 00:34:25.249
This was recovered
at the scene.

949
00:34:25.335 --> 00:34:26.211
Don't panic.
Don't panic!

950
00:34:26.295 --> 00:34:27.205
Don't tell me
not to panic.

951
00:34:27.295 --> 00:34:28.205
Just keep it together.

952
00:34:28.295 --> 00:34:29.171
Everything is not okay!

953
00:34:29.255 --> 00:34:30.131
LITTLE GIRL:
Boo.

954
00:34:30.215 --> 00:34:31.648
...could be contaminated.

955
00:34:31.735 --> 00:34:32.770
Gentlemen, safety

956
00:34:32.855 --> 00:34:33.970
is our number one concern.

957
00:34:34.055 --> 00:34:35.329
If there's anything that...

958
00:34:35.415 --> 00:34:36.325
Not now, not now.

959
00:34:36.415 --> 00:34:37.894
Oh, hello, little one.

960
00:34:37.975 --> 00:34:39.613
Where did you come from?

961
00:34:39.695 --> 00:34:40.650
Mr Waternoose!

962
00:34:40.735 --> 00:34:42.373
Ah,James!
Is this one yours?

963
00:34:42.455 --> 00:34:45.925
Actually, that's my, uh,
cousin's sister's daughter, sir.

964
00:34:46.015 --> 00:34:47.687
Yeah, it's, uh...

965
00:34:47.775 --> 00:34:50.448
''Bring an Obscure Relative
to Work Day.''

966
00:34:50.535 --> 00:34:51.968
Hmm, must have
missed the memo.

967
00:34:52.055 --> 00:34:53.090
Well, listen,James

968
00:34:53.175 --> 00:34:55.564
why don't you stop by
the simulator after lunch today

969
00:34:55.655 --> 00:34:57.247
and give us
that scare demonstration

970
00:34:57.335 --> 00:34:58.450
we talked about, huh?

971
00:34:58.535 --> 00:35:00.014
Oh, oh, sir, uh....

972
00:35:00.095 --> 00:35:01.323
Excuse me,
Mr Waternoose?

973
00:35:01.415 --> 00:35:02.530
Yes, yes, I'm coming.

974
00:35:02.615 --> 00:35:04.765
All right then, I'll see
you this afternoon,James.

975
00:35:04.855 --> 00:35:06.971
That is, if these gentlemen
haven't shut us down.

976
00:35:07.055 --> 00:35:08.010
Oh, boy.

977
00:35:08.095 --> 00:35:09.005
Oh, a scare demo.

978
00:35:09.095 --> 00:35:10.050
Well, that is great.

979
00:35:10.135 --> 00:35:11.124
Why am I
the last to know?

980
00:35:11.215 --> 00:35:13.251
We can bring your cousin's
sister's daughter along.

981
00:35:13.335 --> 00:35:14.245
She'll be a big hit!

982
00:35:14.335 --> 00:35:15.450
( equipoent buzzing loudly )

983
00:35:15.535 --> 00:35:16.570
Halt!

984
00:35:16.655 --> 00:35:17.565
( yelling )

985
00:35:17.655 --> 00:35:18.610
Stop him!

986
00:35:18.695 --> 00:35:20.287
Hold him down.

987
00:35:23.855 --> 00:35:24.970
Come on,
the coast is clear.

988
00:35:25.055 --> 00:35:27.489
Okay, all we have to do
is get rid of that thing.

989
00:35:27.575 --> 00:35:29.566
So, wait here while
I get its card key.

990
00:35:29.655 --> 00:35:30.804
But she can't stay here.

991
00:35:30.895 --> 00:35:32.044
This is the men's room.

992
00:35:32.135 --> 00:35:34.774
That is the weirdest thing
you have ever said.

993
00:35:34.855 --> 00:35:36.049
It's fine. It's okay.

994
00:35:36.135 --> 00:35:37.170
Look, it loves it here!

995
00:35:37.255 --> 00:35:38.244
It's dancing with joy!

996
00:35:38.335 --> 00:35:39.563
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

997
00:35:39.655 --> 00:35:41.611
I'll be right back
with its door key.

998
00:35:41.695 --> 00:35:42.810
( laughs )

999
00:35:42.895 --> 00:35:45.363
That's a cute little
dance you've got.

1000
00:35:45.455 --> 00:35:47.047
It almost looks
like you've got to...

1001
00:35:47.135 --> 00:35:48.727
( whining )

1002
00:35:48.815 --> 00:35:50.646
Oh.

1003
00:35:50.735 --> 00:35:53.613
( singing in baby talk )

1004
00:35:58.295 --> 00:36:00.126
( singing stops )

1005
00:36:00.215 --> 00:36:03.764
Uh, are you
done in there?

1006
00:36:03.855 --> 00:36:05.004
( squeals )

1007
00:36:05.095 --> 00:36:07.450
Ah! Sorry. Sorry.

1008
00:36:07.535 --> 00:36:10.174
( singing )

1009
00:36:16.135 --> 00:36:18.774
( toilet flushes )

1010
00:36:18.855 --> 00:36:20.925
Okay, you
finished now, right?

1011
00:36:21.015 --> 00:36:22.209
Hello?

1012
00:36:23.615 --> 00:36:24.491
( yells )

1013
00:36:26.695 --> 00:36:27.889
Boo.

1014
00:36:27.975 --> 00:36:29.203
( giggles )

1015
00:36:29.295 --> 00:36:31.445
( sighs )

1016
00:36:31.535 --> 00:36:33.048
( giggling )

1017
00:36:35.135 --> 00:36:36.887
( chuckles )

1018
00:36:36.975 --> 00:36:39.648
Where did she go?

1019
00:36:39.735 --> 00:36:41.965
Oh, did she disappear?

1020
00:36:42.055 --> 00:36:44.410
Did she turn invisible?

1021
00:36:44.495 --> 00:36:46.087
( giggling softly )

1022
00:36:46.175 --> 00:36:47.654
I just have no idea.

1023
00:36:49.015 --> 00:36:50.448
Gotcha!

1024
00:36:50.535 --> 00:36:53.049
Boo.

1025
00:36:53.135 --> 00:36:54.284
( giggles )

1026
00:36:54.375 --> 00:36:56.206
Hey, you're good.

1027
00:36:57.695 --> 00:36:59.014
( sighs )

1028
00:37:01.735 --> 00:37:05.045
Be relaxed,
be relaxed, be relaxed.

1029
00:37:05.135 --> 00:37:06.568
Roz, my tender,
oozing blossom

1030
00:37:06.655 --> 00:37:08.134
you're looking
fabulous today.

1031
00:37:08.215 --> 00:37:09.364
Is that a new haircut?

1032
00:37:09.455 --> 00:37:10.365
Come on, tell me.

1033
00:37:10.455 --> 00:37:11.774
It's a new haircut,
isn't it?

1034
00:37:11.855 --> 00:37:12.731
That's got to be
a new haircut.

1035
00:37:12.815 --> 00:37:13.725
New make-up?
You've had a lift.

1036
00:37:13.815 --> 00:37:15.134
You've had a tuck.
You've had something.

1037
00:37:15.215 --> 00:37:16.933
Something has been
inserted in your skin

1038
00:37:17.015 --> 00:37:18.209
that makes you look like...

1039
00:37:18.295 --> 00:37:19.808
( sighs )

1040
00:37:19.895 --> 00:37:21.089
Listen, I need a favour.

1041
00:37:21.175 --> 00:37:23.006
Randall was working
late last night

1042
00:37:23.095 --> 00:37:24.369
out on the scare floor.

1043
00:37:24.455 --> 00:37:27.049
I really need the key
for the door he was using.

1044
00:37:27.135 --> 00:37:28.648
Well, isn't that nice?

1045
00:37:28.735 --> 00:37:30.930
But guess what?

1046
00:37:31.015 --> 00:37:34.212
You didn't turn in
your paperwork last night.

1047
00:37:34.295 --> 00:37:36.092
He didn't... I...
no paperwork?

1048
00:37:36.175 --> 00:37:38.131
This office is now closed.

1049
00:37:39.135 --> 00:37:40.693
( Mike screaos in pain )

1050
00:37:40.775 --> 00:37:43.050
Ready or not, here I come!

1051
00:37:43.135 --> 00:37:44.887
I'm getting warmer.

1052
00:37:44.975 --> 00:37:46.124
Any second now.

1053
00:37:46.215 --> 00:37:49.207
Fee fi fo...

1054
00:37:49.295 --> 00:37:50.330
What are you doing?!

1055
00:37:50.415 --> 00:37:52.087
I-I'm looking
for the kid.

1056
00:37:52.175 --> 00:37:53.290
You lost it?!

1057
00:37:53.375 --> 00:37:54.524
No, no, she was just....

1058
00:37:54.615 --> 00:37:56.287
( squeals )

1059
00:37:56.375 --> 00:37:57.444
Here she is.

1060
00:37:57.535 --> 00:37:58.490
( whining )

1061
00:37:58.575 --> 00:37:59.849
Hey, what's the matter?

1062
00:37:59.935 --> 00:38:02.495
RAND ALL:
I already told your buddies
I haven't seen anything.

1063
00:38:02.575 --> 00:38:03.974
CD A AGENT:
All right. Carry on.

1064
00:38:11.895 --> 00:38:12.964
( splashing )

1065
00:38:13.775 --> 00:38:14.969
Randall!
Thank goodness!

1066
00:38:15.055 --> 00:38:17.285
What are we going to do
about the child?

1067
00:38:17.375 --> 00:38:18.524
Shh!

1068
00:38:19.695 --> 00:38:21.606
Shh, shh, shh.

1069
00:38:26.495 --> 00:38:28.292
( door slaos open )

1070
00:38:32.135 --> 00:38:33.170
( door slaos open )

1071
00:38:37.895 --> 00:38:39.806
The front page!
It's on the front page.

1072
00:38:39.895 --> 00:38:41.567
The child--
the one you were after.

1073
00:38:41.655 --> 00:38:42.690
Will you be quiet?!

1074
00:38:42.775 --> 00:38:44.811
Don't you think I'm aware
of the situation?

1075
00:38:44.895 --> 00:38:46.613
I was up all night
trying to find it.

1076
00:38:46.695 --> 00:38:48.014
I did a simple
calculation

1077
00:38:48.095 --> 00:38:50.484
factoring in the size
of the sushi restaurant.

1078
00:38:50.575 --> 00:38:51.974
The child
may have escaped!

1079
00:38:52.055 --> 00:38:53.568
Yeah, well, until
we know for sure

1080
00:38:53.655 --> 00:38:55.725
we're going to act like
nothing happened, understand?

1081
00:38:55.815 --> 00:38:57.453
You just get the
machine up and running.

1082
00:38:57.535 --> 00:38:58.604
I'll take care of the kid.

1083
00:38:58.695 --> 00:39:00.811
And when I find whoever
let it out, they're dead!

1084
00:39:00.895 --> 00:39:02.248
Oh!

1085
00:39:03.695 --> 00:39:04.889
Why are you still here?

1086
00:39:04.975 --> 00:39:06.124
Come on, go!

1087
00:39:06.215 --> 00:39:07.284
Move! Now!

1088
00:39:07.375 --> 00:39:08.649
FUNGUS:
Ow, ow! I'm not here.

1089
00:39:08.735 --> 00:39:10.771
SULLEY ( whispering ):
They're gone.

1090
00:39:10.855 --> 00:39:12.288
( squeaking and splashing )

1091
00:39:12.375 --> 00:39:14.047
LITTLE GIRL:
Ew.

1092
00:39:14.135 --> 00:39:15.250
MIKE:
This is bad.

1093
00:39:15.335 --> 00:39:16.688
This is so very bad.

1094
00:39:16.775 --> 00:39:18.254
What were they talking
about a machine?

1095
00:39:18.335 --> 00:39:19.324
Who cares? Oh!

1096
00:39:19.415 --> 00:39:20.814
Look, don't panic--
all we have to do

1097
00:39:20.895 --> 00:39:22.453
is call her door down
and send her home.

1098
00:39:22.535 --> 00:39:23.604
You're right.
You're right.

1099
00:39:23.695 --> 00:39:25.811
We're just two regular joes
on our way to work.

1100
00:39:25.895 --> 00:39:27.248
We will blend right in.

1101
00:39:27.335 --> 00:39:28.563
Top of the mornin', fellas!

1102
00:39:28.655 --> 00:39:29.929
Hey, what's shakin',
bacon?

1103
00:39:30.015 --> 00:39:31.050
Did you lose weight?

1104
00:39:31.135 --> 00:39:32.250
Or a limb?

1105
00:39:32.335 --> 00:39:33.529
You have
her card key, right?

1106
00:39:33.615 --> 00:39:34.809
Of course
I have her card key.

1107
00:39:34.895 --> 00:39:36.248
I told you
I'd get her card key.

1108
00:39:36.335 --> 00:39:37.404
I went and got
her card key

1109
00:39:37.495 --> 00:39:39.406
and now I have her card key.

1110
00:39:40.495 --> 00:39:42.531
Okay, here we go.

1111
00:39:42.615 --> 00:39:43.684
Take care of yourself.

1112
00:39:43.775 --> 00:39:45.731
Try not to run
through any more closets.

1113
00:39:45.815 --> 00:39:47.248
( giggles )

1114
00:39:47.335 --> 00:39:49.690
Mike,
that's not her door.

1115
00:39:49.775 --> 00:39:51.333
What are you
talking about?

1116
00:39:51.415 --> 00:39:52.928
Of course it's her door.
It's her door.

1117
00:39:53.015 --> 00:39:54.971
No, her door was white
and it had flowers on it.

1118
00:39:55.055 --> 00:39:56.773
No. It must have been
dark last night

1119
00:39:56.855 --> 00:39:57.970
because this is its door.

1120
00:39:58.055 --> 00:39:59.124
( polka ousic playing )

1121
00:39:59.215 --> 00:40:00.170
Hey, you hear that?

1122
00:40:00.255 --> 00:40:02.132
Sounds like fun in there!

1123
00:40:02.215 --> 00:40:03.534
Okay, send me a postcard, kid.

1124
00:40:03.615 --> 00:40:05.014
That's Mike Wazowski, care of

1125
00:40:05.095 --> 00:40:07.211
22 Mike-Wazowski-
you-got-your-life-back Lane.

1126
00:40:07.295 --> 00:40:08.614
Mowki Kowski.

1127
00:40:08.695 --> 00:40:10.287
Very good.
Now bon voyage!

1128
00:40:10.375 --> 00:40:11.728
Bye-bye!
Come on.

1129
00:40:11.815 --> 00:40:13.328
Look at the stick.
See the stick?

1130
00:40:13.415 --> 00:40:14.564
Go get the stick!
Go fetch.

1131
00:40:14.655 --> 00:40:16.532
Mike, this isn't
Boo's door.

1132
00:40:16.615 --> 00:40:17.889
Boo? What's Boo?

1133
00:40:17.975 --> 00:40:20.205
That's what I decided
to call her.

1134
00:40:20.295 --> 00:40:21.694
Is there a problem?

1135
00:40:21.775 --> 00:40:23.413
Sulley, you're not
supposed to name it.

1136
00:40:23.495 --> 00:40:25.690
Once you name it,
you start getting attached to it!

1137
00:40:25.775 --> 00:40:26.764
Now put that thing

1138
00:40:26.855 --> 00:40:29.653
back where it came from,
or so help me...

1139
00:40:33.135 --> 00:40:34.170
Oh, hey!

1140
00:40:34.255 --> 00:40:36.815
We're rehearsing a scene
for the upcoming company play

1141
00:40:36.895 --> 00:40:39.125
~called Put That Thing
Back Where It Caoe Froo

1142
00:40:39.215 --> 00:40:40.409
Or So Help Me.

1143
00:40:40.495 --> 00:40:41.405
( Mike laughing )

1144
00:40:41.495 --> 00:40:42.484
It's a musical!

1145
00:40:42.575 --> 00:40:44.566
Put that thing back where
it came from or so help me

1146
00:40:44.655 --> 00:40:45.770
Bom-bom, bom-bom,
bom-bom...

1147
00:40:45.855 --> 00:40:46.731
So help me,
so help me.

1148
00:40:46.815 --> 00:40:47.964
And cut!

1149
00:40:48.055 --> 00:40:49.124
We're still working on it.

1150
00:40:49.215 --> 00:40:50.091
It's a work in progress

1151
00:40:50.175 --> 00:40:51.688
but, hey,
we need ushers.

1152
00:40:51.775 --> 00:40:52.810
Sulley, I've had enough.

1153
00:40:52.895 --> 00:40:54.487
Now say goodbye to...
where'd it go?

1154
00:40:54.575 --> 00:40:55.530
What'd you do with it?

1155
00:40:55.615 --> 00:40:56.525
( gasps ):
Where is she?

1156
00:40:56.615 --> 00:40:57.570
I don't believe it.

1157
00:40:57.655 --> 00:40:58.883
She got away
from you again?!

1158
00:40:58.975 --> 00:40:59.771
Well, that is just...

1159
00:40:59.855 --> 00:41:00.810
Wait a minute.

1160
00:41:00.895 --> 00:41:02.374
The sun is coming up.

1161
00:41:02.455 --> 00:41:03.604
This is perfect!

1162
00:41:03.695 --> 00:41:05.413
She's gone!

1163
00:41:05.495 --> 00:41:06.769
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1164
00:41:06.855 --> 00:41:07.731
Where are you going?

1165
00:41:07.815 --> 00:41:09.009
Sulley, please,
don't blow this.

1166
00:41:09.095 --> 00:41:10.926
Not when we're so close
to breaking the record.

1167
00:41:11.015 --> 00:41:12.243
Somebody else
will find the kid.

1168
00:41:12.335 --> 00:41:13.563
It'll be their problem,
not ours!

1169
00:41:13.655 --> 00:41:14.565
She's out of our hair!

1170
00:41:15.535 --> 00:41:16.934
What are you
two doing?

1171
00:41:17.015 --> 00:41:19.006
They're rehearsing a play.

1172
00:41:19.095 --> 00:41:20.574
She's out of our hair!

1173
00:41:20.655 --> 00:41:21.724
Can it, Wazowski!

1174
00:41:21.815 --> 00:41:24.648
So, what do you think
of that kid getting out, Sullivan?

1175
00:41:24.735 --> 00:41:25.804
Pretty crazy, huh?

1176
00:41:25.895 --> 00:41:27.647
Oh, yeah, crazy.

1177
00:41:27.735 --> 00:41:28.724
Word on the street is the kid's

1178
00:41:28.815 --> 00:41:29.884
been traced back
to this factory.

1179
00:41:29.975 --> 00:41:31.124
You haven't seen anything,
have you?

1180
00:41:31.215 --> 00:41:32.614
Uh, well, uh...

1181
00:41:32.695 --> 00:41:33.810
No, no way!

1182
00:41:33.895 --> 00:41:36.045
But if it was
an inside job

1183
00:41:36.135 --> 00:41:37.932
I'd put my money
on Waxford.

1184
00:41:38.015 --> 00:41:39.084
Waxford?

1185
00:41:39.175 --> 00:41:40.324
Yeah, the one
at station six.

1186
00:41:40.415 --> 00:41:41.848
You know, he's got
them shifty eyes.

1187
00:41:41.935 --> 00:41:43.129
Hey, Waxford!

1188
00:41:43.215 --> 00:41:44.330
Sulley!

1189
00:41:44.415 --> 00:41:45.973
CELIA:
Michael Wazowski!

1190
00:41:47.655 --> 00:41:48.690
( whiopers )

1191
00:41:48.775 --> 00:41:50.811
Last night was one
of the worst nights

1192
00:41:50.895 --> 00:41:52.408
of my entire life,
bar none!

1193
00:41:52.495 --> 00:41:53.928
( hissing )

1194
00:41:54.815 --> 00:41:56.009
I thought
you cared about me.

1195
00:41:56.095 --> 00:41:57.005
Honey, please.

1196
00:41:57.095 --> 00:41:59.290
Schmoopsie, I thought
you liked sushi.

1197
00:41:59.375 --> 00:42:00.808
CELIA:
Sushi? Sushi?!!

1198
00:42:00.895 --> 00:42:03.409
You think this is
about sushi?!

1199
00:42:08.815 --> 00:42:09.964
Wazowski!

1200
00:42:10.055 --> 00:42:11.568
Michael! Mike...

1201
00:42:11.655 --> 00:42:12.849
Men.

1202
00:42:12.935 --> 00:42:13.890
( panting )

1203
00:42:13.975 --> 00:42:15.374
Breathe. Keep breathing.

1204
00:42:23.615 --> 00:42:25.128
Whew.

1205
00:42:25.215 --> 00:42:26.250
Yikes!

1206
00:42:26.335 --> 00:42:28.053
Where's the kid?

1207
00:42:28.135 --> 00:42:29.693
Kid? What kid?

1208
00:42:29.775 --> 00:42:31.174
It's here in
the factory, isn't it?

1209
00:42:31.255 --> 00:42:32.404
You're not
pinning this on me.

1210
00:42:32.495 --> 00:42:33.689
It never would
have gotten out

1211
00:42:33.775 --> 00:42:35.333
if you hadn't been
cheating last night!

1212
00:42:35.415 --> 00:42:36.564
Cheating?

1213
00:42:37.775 --> 00:42:39.333
Cheating. Right.

1214
00:42:39.415 --> 00:42:43.203
Okay, I think I know how
to make this all go away.

1215
00:42:43.295 --> 00:42:47.334
What happens when
the whistle blows
in five minutes?

1216
00:42:47.415 --> 00:42:49.849
Uh... I get a time-out?

1217
00:42:49.935 --> 00:42:52.529
Everyone goes to lunch!

1218
00:42:52.615 --> 00:42:55.766
Which means the scare floor
will be...?

1219
00:42:57.015 --> 00:42:58.130
Painted?

1220
00:42:58.215 --> 00:43:01.048
Empty! It'll be
empty, you idiot!

1221
00:43:01.135 --> 00:43:02.807
You see that clock?

1222
00:43:02.895 --> 00:43:04.965
When the big hand
is pointing up

1223
00:43:05.055 --> 00:43:07.171
and the little hand
is pointing up

1224
00:43:07.255 --> 00:43:09.530
the kid's door
will be in my station.

1225
00:43:09.615 --> 00:43:11.810
But when the big hand
points down

1226
00:43:11.895 --> 00:43:14.363
the door will be gone.

1227
00:43:14.455 --> 00:43:17.367
You have until then
to put the kid back.

1228
00:43:17.455 --> 00:43:20.049
Get the picture?

1229
00:43:20.135 --> 00:43:22.569
( roaring playfully )

1230
00:43:29.735 --> 00:43:30.611
Boo!

1231
00:43:30.695 --> 00:43:32.128
( giggles )

1232
00:43:32.215 --> 00:43:33.091
No.

1233
00:43:33.175 --> 00:43:34.210
Hey, you! Halt!

1234
00:43:34.295 --> 00:43:35.808
He's the one.

1235
00:43:35.895 --> 00:43:37.169
The one from
the commercial!

1236
00:43:37.255 --> 00:43:38.370
Affirmative.
That's him.

1237
00:43:38.455 --> 00:43:39.604
Can we get
an autograph?

1238
00:43:39.695 --> 00:43:41.128
Oh, oh, sure.
No problem.

1239
00:43:41.215 --> 00:43:44.093
You can make that out
to Bethany, my daughter.

1240
00:43:44.175 --> 00:43:45.369
Yes. Let's see....

1241
00:43:45.455 --> 00:43:47.127
''From your scary friend

1242
00:43:47.215 --> 00:43:48.728
best wishes...''

1243
00:43:48.815 --> 00:43:50.726
So I said,
''If you talk to me

1244
00:43:50.815 --> 00:43:52.931
like that again,
we're through!''

1245
00:43:53.015 --> 00:43:54.004
What'd she say?

1246
00:43:54.095 --> 00:43:55.164
You know my mom.

1247
00:43:55.255 --> 00:43:56.893
She sent me to my room.

1248
00:43:56.975 --> 00:43:58.567
See you guys later.
Take it easy.

1249
00:43:58.655 --> 00:43:59.770
Bottoms up!

1250
00:44:02.895 --> 00:44:03.611
( gasps in horror )

1251
00:44:16.015 --> 00:44:17.084
No!

1252
00:44:17.175 --> 00:44:20.611
( singing )

1253
00:44:20.695 --> 00:44:21.525
Whoa!

1254
00:44:21.615 --> 00:44:22.730
Hey.

1255
00:44:22.815 --> 00:44:24.851
( growling )

1256
00:44:24.935 --> 00:44:26.368
Oh, well, hello, there.

1257
00:44:26.455 --> 00:44:27.729
What's your name?

1258
00:44:27.815 --> 00:44:29.533
Mike Wazowski!

1259
00:44:30.695 --> 00:44:33.289
( oachinery pounding loudly )

1260
00:44:41.415 --> 00:44:43.371
( grinding and chopping )

1261
00:44:51.175 --> 00:44:53.291
( panting )

1262
00:45:02.535 --> 00:45:05.447
( ooans )

1263
00:45:06.895 --> 00:45:08.453
Sulley!

1264
00:45:08.535 --> 00:45:10.207
Oh, Sulley.

1265
00:45:11.215 --> 00:45:13.490
Okay, Sulley, come on, enough.

1266
00:45:13.575 --> 00:45:15.531
Hey, you guys seen
Sulley anywhere?

1267
00:45:15.615 --> 00:45:16.764
Nope. Sorry.

1268
00:45:16.855 --> 00:45:17.924
Oh, Sulley!

1269
00:45:18.015 --> 00:45:20.404
Boy, Wazowski looks
like he's in trouble.

1270
00:45:20.495 --> 00:45:21.848
( squeaking and quacking )

1271
00:45:21.935 --> 00:45:23.129
231 9!

1272
00:45:23.215 --> 00:45:24.773
We have a 231 9!

1273
00:45:24.855 --> 00:45:25.924
Oh, dear.

1274
00:45:26.015 --> 00:45:27.084
Get him!

1275
00:45:27.175 --> 00:45:29.006
Sulley?

1276
00:45:29.095 --> 00:45:30.574
Sulley!

1277
00:45:31.815 --> 00:45:33.373
( ooaning )

1278
00:45:33.455 --> 00:45:34.410
Sulley!

1279
00:45:34.495 --> 00:45:35.564
Oh, great news, pal.

1280
00:45:35.655 --> 00:45:36.883
I got us a way out of this mess

1281
00:45:36.975 --> 00:45:38.090
but we got to hurry.

1282
00:45:38.175 --> 00:45:39.210
Where is it?

1283
00:45:39.295 --> 00:45:41.251
( whiopering )

1284
00:45:41.335 --> 00:45:43.132
Sull, that's
a cube of garbage.

1285
00:45:43.215 --> 00:45:44.443
( squeaks )

1286
00:45:44.535 --> 00:45:45.729
Uh-oh.

1287
00:45:45.815 --> 00:45:48.568
I-I can still hear
her little voice.

1288
00:45:48.655 --> 00:45:50.008
BOO:
Mike Wazowski!

1289
00:45:50.095 --> 00:45:51.369
Hey, I can hear her, too.

1290
00:45:51.455 --> 00:45:52.888
BABY MONSTERS:
Mike Wazowski!

1291
00:45:52.975 --> 00:45:54.533
How many kids
you got in there?

1292
00:45:54.615 --> 00:45:56.446
Mike Wazowski!

1293
00:45:56.535 --> 00:45:57.604
Kitty!

1294
00:45:57.695 --> 00:45:59.333
Boo!

1295
00:46:00.335 --> 00:46:01.654
Boo, oh,
you're all right!

1296
00:46:01.735 --> 00:46:03.566
I was so worried!

1297
00:46:03.655 --> 00:46:07.933
Don't you ever run away
from me again, young lady!

1298
00:46:08.015 --> 00:46:10.893
Oh, but I'm so glad
you're safe.

1299
00:46:10.975 --> 00:46:13.933
My, what an affectionate father.

1300
00:46:14.015 --> 00:46:15.926
Actually, she's
my cousin's sister's...

1301
00:46:16.015 --> 00:46:16.891
Okay, Sulley.

1302
00:46:16.975 --> 00:46:17.964
That's enough.
Let's go.

1303
00:46:18.055 --> 00:46:18.931
Mike Wazowski!

1304
00:46:19.015 --> 00:46:19.891
Yeah, yeah.

1305
00:46:19.975 --> 00:46:21.249
Step aside, kid.
We're in a...

1306
00:46:21.335 --> 00:46:22.085
( screaos in pain )

1307
00:46:22.175 --> 00:46:22.971
( screaos with laughter )

1308
00:46:23.055 --> 00:46:23.726
( electrical buzzing )

1309
00:46:23.815 --> 00:46:24.725
( light bulbs shattering )

1310
00:46:24.815 --> 00:46:25.884
( gasping )

1311
00:46:25.975 --> 00:46:28.205
( baby oonsters screaoing
~ and crying )

1312
00:46:28.295 --> 00:46:30.809
Will you stop
making Boo laugh?

1313
00:46:30.895 --> 00:46:32.487
I didn't, so come on!

1314
00:46:32.575 --> 00:46:34.964
( screaoing and crying
~ continue )

1315
00:46:35.055 --> 00:46:36.010
I still don't understand.

1316
00:46:36.095 --> 00:46:36.971
You've got Boo's door?

1317
00:46:37.055 --> 00:46:37.885
I'll explain later.

1318
00:46:37.975 --> 00:46:38.851
Run.

1319
00:46:38.935 --> 00:46:40.254
Okay, let's move,
let's move, let's move.

1320
00:46:40.335 --> 00:46:41.370
Come on.

1321
00:46:41.455 --> 00:46:43.252
Oh, please be there, please
be there, please be there.

1322
00:46:43.335 --> 00:46:44.768
There it is!

1323
00:46:44.855 --> 00:46:45.731
Just like Randall said!

1324
00:46:45.815 --> 00:46:46.725
Randall?
Wait a minute.

1325
00:46:46.815 --> 00:46:47.691
( cries out in fear )

1326
00:46:47.775 --> 00:46:48.651
Oh, hey.

1327
00:46:48.735 --> 00:46:49.611
One, two, three, four!

1328
00:46:49.695 --> 00:46:50.684
Get the kid back
through the door!

1329
00:46:50.775 --> 00:46:51.651
Hey, hey.

1330
00:46:51.735 --> 00:46:52.804
We're going to get
our lives back.

1331
00:46:52.895 --> 00:46:53.771
The nightmare is over.

1332
00:46:53.855 --> 00:46:54.731
Hey, it's okay, Boo.

1333
00:46:54.815 --> 00:46:55.486
What's the matter?

1334
00:46:55.575 --> 00:46:56.803
Come on, it's time to move!

1335
00:46:56.895 --> 00:46:57.805
Mike, what are you thinking?

1336
00:46:57.895 --> 00:46:58.771
We can't trust Randall.

1337
00:46:58.855 --> 00:46:59.731
He's after Boo.

1338
00:46:59.815 --> 00:47:00.691
Who cares?
Let's go.

1339
00:47:00.775 --> 00:47:01.730
This is a limited time offer.

1340
00:47:01.815 --> 00:47:02.691
No, no.

1341
00:47:02.775 --> 00:47:03.651
I don't like this.

1342
00:47:03.735 --> 00:47:06.044
Look, Sulley, you wanted
her door and there it is.

1343
00:47:06.135 --> 00:47:07.011
Now, let's move.

1344
00:47:07.095 --> 00:47:08.608
No, Mike.

1345
00:47:08.695 --> 00:47:10.811
( sighs ):
You want me to prove
everything's on the up-and-up?

1346
00:47:10.895 --> 00:47:12.328
Fine! He wants the door,
I get the door...

1347
00:47:12.415 --> 00:47:13.211
( whispering ):
Mike, wait!

1348
00:47:13.295 --> 00:47:14.887
He's a paranoid
delusional furball.

1349
00:47:17.455 --> 00:47:18.251
Mike!

1350
00:47:22.775 --> 00:47:24.128
( whiopers in fear )

1351
00:47:28.535 --> 00:47:29.729
( whining )

1352
00:47:29.815 --> 00:47:31.487
Shh, shh, shh.

1353
00:47:46.295 --> 00:47:47.330
( soall cry of surprise )

1354
00:48:04.575 --> 00:48:07.453
( lunch bell rings )

1355
00:48:14.735 --> 00:48:17.966
Hey, Sulley,
where you been all day?

1356
00:48:18.055 --> 00:48:19.534
Sulley? Sulley?

1357
00:48:33.455 --> 00:48:34.365
Huh?

1358
00:48:34.455 --> 00:48:35.729
( whispering ):
Mike?

1359
00:48:35.815 --> 00:48:36.691
Mike?

1360
00:48:36.775 --> 00:48:39.448
Where are you?

1361
00:48:39.535 --> 00:48:41.287
You in there?

1362
00:48:41.375 --> 00:48:43.127
Where are you, buddy?

1363
00:48:43.215 --> 00:48:44.170
Mike?

1364
00:48:44.255 --> 00:48:45.574
Hey.

1365
00:48:51.695 --> 00:48:53.094
( door thunks )

1366
00:48:54.695 --> 00:48:55.889
( excited baby talk )

1367
00:48:55.975 --> 00:48:57.533
Boo, way to go.

1368
00:48:57.615 --> 00:48:58.604
( giggles )

1369
00:49:05.215 --> 00:49:06.409
It's okay.

1370
00:49:09.975 --> 00:49:12.284
( door clunks shut )

1371
00:49:21.535 --> 00:49:26.086
( pipes whistling and venting )

1372
00:49:29.895 --> 00:49:32.455
( distant voices )

1373
00:49:35.295 --> 00:49:37.411
RAND ALL:
Yes! I got the kid!

1374
00:49:37.495 --> 00:49:38.848
FUNGUS:
Oh, huzzah!

1375
00:49:38.935 --> 00:49:39.811
That's great news.

1376
00:49:39.895 --> 00:49:41.647
Not that I was concerned,
of course.

1377
00:49:41.735 --> 00:49:43.214
Just get over
here and help me!

1378
00:49:43.295 --> 00:49:44.091
Come on, come
on, come on.

1379
00:49:44.175 --> 00:49:45.130
While we're young
here, Fungus!

1380
00:49:47.375 --> 00:49:49.650
( both straining )

1381
00:49:49.735 --> 00:49:51.453
Kid needs to take
off a few pounds.

1382
00:49:55.335 --> 00:49:56.211
( yelps )

1383
00:49:56.295 --> 00:49:57.205
Wazowski?!

1384
00:49:57.295 --> 00:49:58.694
Where is it,
you little one-eyed cretin?

1385
00:49:58.775 --> 00:49:59.764
Okay, first of all,
it's cree-tin.

1386
00:49:59.855 --> 00:50:00.731
If you're going
to threaten me

1387
00:50:00.815 --> 00:50:01.770
do it properly.

1388
00:50:01.855 --> 00:50:03.846
Second of all, you're nuts
if you think kidnapping me

1389
00:50:03.935 --> 00:50:05.653
is going to help you cheat
your way to the top!

1390
00:50:05.735 --> 00:50:07.009
( chuckling evilly )

1391
00:50:07.095 --> 00:50:11.213
You still think this is about
that stupid scare record?

1392
00:50:11.295 --> 00:50:14.492
Well... I did, right up
until you chuckled like that

1393
00:50:14.575 --> 00:50:17.726
and now I'm thinking
I should just get out of here.

1394
00:50:17.815 --> 00:50:21.046
I am about to revolutionise
the scaring industry

1395
00:50:21.135 --> 00:50:24.252
and when I do, even
the great James P. Sullivan

1396
00:50:24.335 --> 00:50:25.814
is going to be
working for me.

1397
00:50:25.895 --> 00:50:26.771
MIKE:
Well

1398
00:50:26.855 --> 00:50:29.005
somebody's certainly
been a busy bee.

1399
00:50:29.095 --> 00:50:30.687
First, I need to know
where the kid is

1400
00:50:30.775 --> 00:50:31.924
and you're going
to tell me.

1401
00:50:32.015 --> 00:50:33.164
Yeah, I don't
know anything.

1402
00:50:33.255 --> 00:50:34.165
Uh-huh, sure.

1403
00:50:34.255 --> 00:50:35.131
MIKE:
I don't.

1404
00:50:35.215 --> 00:50:36.204
I mean, I don't.

1405
00:50:36.295 --> 00:50:37.614
Uh-oh.

1406
00:50:37.695 --> 00:50:39.014
( oechanical clanging
~ and grinding )

1407
00:50:39.095 --> 00:50:39.971
What's that?

1408
00:50:40.055 --> 00:50:41.329
Come on.
Wait, wait, wait.

1409
00:50:41.415 --> 00:50:42.643
Oh-oh. Oh-oh.
Oh, come on.

1410
00:50:42.735 --> 00:50:43.611
No, no, no, no, no.

1411
00:50:43.695 --> 00:50:44.764
Come on,
hey, hey, hey.

1412
00:50:44.855 --> 00:50:46.493
This thing is moving.

1413
00:50:46.575 --> 00:50:48.486
I don't like big...

1414
00:50:48.575 --> 00:50:50.725
moving things that are
moving towards me.

1415
00:50:50.815 --> 00:50:52.089
No! Come on!

1416
00:50:52.175 --> 00:50:53.608
Hey, Randall!

1417
00:50:53.695 --> 00:50:56.732
Say hello
to the scream extractor.

1418
00:50:56.815 --> 00:50:58.692
Hello.

1419
00:50:58.775 --> 00:50:59.924
Come on,
where you going?

1420
00:51:00.015 --> 00:51:00.845
We'll talk.

1421
00:51:00.935 --> 00:51:02.004
Come on,
we'll have a latte!

1422
00:51:02.095 --> 00:51:03.084
Come on.

1423
00:51:03.175 --> 00:51:04.767
We can talk
about this.

1424
00:51:04.855 --> 00:51:07.574
( electrical whirring starts,
~ then grows louder )

1425
00:51:07.655 --> 00:51:10.249
What's that thing?
What is that thing?

1426
00:51:10.335 --> 00:51:11.450
Wait, wait, wait!

1427
00:51:11.535 --> 00:51:12.570
Stop, stop!

1428
00:51:12.655 --> 00:51:13.883
No, no!

1429
00:51:13.975 --> 00:51:14.885
Come on, hey!

1430
00:51:14.975 --> 00:51:16.408
( deep, resonating whirring )

1431
00:51:16.495 --> 00:51:18.087
Help! Help! Help!

1432
00:51:18.175 --> 00:51:19.085
Help!

1433
00:51:19.175 --> 00:51:21.086
( yelling )

1434
00:51:23.935 --> 00:51:25.334
( noise dies away )

1435
00:51:25.415 --> 00:51:26.370
Oh, for...

1436
00:51:26.455 --> 00:51:27.729
What did you
do wrong this time?

1437
00:51:27.815 --> 00:51:28.804
I don't know.

1438
00:51:28.895 --> 00:51:30.044
I calibrated the drive...

1439
00:51:30.135 --> 00:51:31.409
Go check the machine!

1440
00:51:31.495 --> 00:51:33.645
There must be something wrong
with the scream intake valve.

1441
00:51:33.735 --> 00:51:36.249
That's the problem
with these 3250 units...

1442
00:51:36.335 --> 00:51:38.246
Huh?

1443
00:51:41.015 --> 00:51:42.971
Hmm.

1444
00:51:52.808 --> 00:51:54.036
Psst!

1445
00:51:54.128 --> 00:51:55.402
Fungus.
Fungus.

1446
00:51:55.488 --> 00:51:57.479
You like cars, huh?

1447
00:51:57.568 --> 00:51:58.967
'Cause I got a really nice car.

1448
00:51:59.048 --> 00:52:01.278
If you let me go,
I'll give you...

1449
00:52:01.368 --> 00:52:02.596
a ride in the car.

1450
00:52:02.688 --> 00:52:03.962
Please, Fungus?

1451
00:52:04.048 --> 00:52:05.640
I'm sorry, Wazowski,
but Randall said

1452
00:52:05.728 --> 00:52:08.447
I'm not allowed to fraternize
with victims of his evil plot.

1453
00:52:08.528 --> 00:52:09.483
( gasps )

1454
00:52:09.568 --> 00:52:10.887
( clanging )

1455
00:52:10.968 --> 00:52:12.242
Hmm...

1456
00:52:13.208 --> 00:52:14.084
( zapping )

1457
00:52:14.168 --> 00:52:16.159
( electrical whirring )

1458
00:52:16.248 --> 00:52:19.240
( clanking, rattling, whirring )

1459
00:52:19.328 --> 00:52:20.204
( gasps )

1460
00:52:20.288 --> 00:52:21.164
( ouffled screaos )

1461
00:52:21.248 --> 00:52:21.964
What happened?

1462
00:52:22.048 --> 00:52:23.686
Where's Wazowski?

1463
00:52:23.768 --> 00:52:25.360
( ouffled screaos )

1464
00:52:25.448 --> 00:52:27.200
( shuts off oachine )

1465
00:52:27.288 --> 00:52:28.482
Where is he?!

1466
00:52:28.568 --> 00:52:30.126
( whiopering )

1467
00:52:30.208 --> 00:52:31.277
( growls )

1468
00:52:31.368 --> 00:52:32.517
( whiopering )

1469
00:52:32.608 --> 00:52:33.643
( squeals )

1470
00:52:33.728 --> 00:52:34.877
Come on!

1471
00:52:34.968 --> 00:52:36.401
This is crazy.
He's going to kill us!

1472
00:52:36.488 --> 00:52:38.524
CD A AGENT:
Careful.
That could be contaminated.

1473
00:52:38.608 --> 00:52:40.087
We got to get out of here now!

1474
00:52:40.168 --> 00:52:42.557
We can start a whole new life
somewhere far away.

1475
00:52:42.648 --> 00:52:43.842
Goodbye, Monsters, Inc.!

1476
00:52:43.928 --> 00:52:45.646
Goodbye, Mr Waternoose!

1477
00:52:45.728 --> 00:52:47.047
No, Mike, wait!

1478
00:52:47.128 --> 00:52:48.447
Hey, what are you doing?

1479
00:52:48.528 --> 00:52:49.881
Follow me. I have an idea.

1480
00:52:49.968 --> 00:52:52.687
No! No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no...

1481
00:52:52.768 --> 00:52:54.759
COMPUTER VOICE ( over P.A. ):
Simulation terminated.

1482
00:52:54.848 --> 00:52:55.997
WATERNOOSE:
No, no, no, no, no.

1483
00:52:56.088 --> 00:52:57.123
What was that?

1484
00:52:57.208 --> 00:52:59.847
You're trying to scare the kid,
not lull it to sleep.

1485
00:52:59.928 --> 00:53:02.761
I was going for a
snake/ ninja approach

1486
00:53:02.848 --> 00:53:04.076
with a little hissing.

1487
00:53:04.168 --> 00:53:05.044
( hisses )

1488
00:53:05.128 --> 00:53:07.437
How many times
do I have to tell you?

1489
00:53:07.528 --> 00:53:09.041
It's all about presence!

1490
00:53:09.128 --> 00:53:11.005
About how you enter the room!

1491
00:53:11.088 --> 00:53:12.521
Mr Waternoose!

1492
00:53:12.608 --> 00:53:14.405
James! Perfect timing.

1493
00:53:14.488 --> 00:53:15.887
No, no. Sir, you
don't understand.

1494
00:53:15.968 --> 00:53:17.799
Ah, now, show these monsters
how it's done.

1495
00:53:17.888 --> 00:53:18.764
What? No, no,
I can't...

1496
00:53:18.848 --> 00:53:19.758
Sir...
sir, you have

1497
00:53:19.848 --> 00:53:20.724
to listen to me.

1498
00:53:20.808 --> 00:53:21.797
Pay attention, everyone.

1499
00:53:21.888 --> 00:53:22.764
You're about to see

1500
00:53:22.848 --> 00:53:24.167
the best in the business.

1501
00:53:24.248 --> 00:53:25.124
Reset the simulator.

1502
00:53:25.208 --> 00:53:26.084
But-but, sir!

1503
00:53:26.168 --> 00:53:27.396
MOTHER:
Good night, sweetheart.

1504
00:53:27.488 --> 00:53:28.762
ANIMATRONIC BO Y:
Night, Mom.

1505
00:53:28.848 --> 00:53:29.724
Kitty!

1506
00:53:29.808 --> 00:53:30.843
No, Boo, no, no!

1507
00:53:30.928 --> 00:53:32.486
Now, give us a big, loud roar.

1508
00:53:32.568 --> 00:53:34.240
Mr Waternoose,
there's no time for this.

1509
00:53:34.328 --> 00:53:35.920
Come on. What are you
waiting for? Roar!

1510
00:53:36.008 --> 00:53:36.884
But-but-but, sir!

1511
00:53:36.968 --> 00:53:37.684
Roar!

1512
00:53:37.768 --> 00:53:38.962
( groans )

1513
00:53:39.048 --> 00:53:40.242
( roaring ferociously )

1514
00:53:40.328 --> 00:53:41.761
( shrieking in terror )

1515
00:53:41.848 --> 00:53:43.327
( gasps )

1516
00:53:43.408 --> 00:53:44.443
( roaring ferociously )

1517
00:53:44.528 --> 00:53:45.517
( squeals )

1518
00:53:45.608 --> 00:53:47.803
( Boo crying )

1519
00:53:47.888 --> 00:53:48.843
( students applauding )

1520
00:53:48.928 --> 00:53:49.838
WATERNOOSE:
Well done.

1521
00:53:49.928 --> 00:53:51.566
Well done,James.

1522
00:53:51.648 --> 00:53:53.081
Boo?

1523
00:53:53.168 --> 00:53:55.682
-All right, gentlemen,
I hope you've learned...
-Right this way, everyone.

1524
00:53:55.768 --> 00:53:57.326
...a valuable lesson
in scaring today.

1525
00:53:57.408 --> 00:53:58.761
( fearful whioper )

1526
00:53:58.848 --> 00:53:59.997
( whines softly )

1527
00:54:00.088 --> 00:54:01.441
Boo.

1528
00:54:01.528 --> 00:54:02.927
( nervous grunt )

1529
00:54:03.008 --> 00:54:04.805
( whining )

1530
00:54:05.808 --> 00:54:07.036
Boo?

1531
00:54:08.008 --> 00:54:10.124
( panicked grunts )

1532
00:54:10.208 --> 00:54:11.323
( door slaos )

1533
00:54:11.408 --> 00:54:14.047
Boo, it's me.

1534
00:54:14.128 --> 00:54:15.243
( squealing )

1535
00:54:16.208 --> 00:54:17.641
( gasps ):
The child!

1536
00:54:17.728 --> 00:54:18.683
Sir, she isn't toxic.

1537
00:54:18.768 --> 00:54:20.565
I know it sounds
crazy, but trust me.

1538
00:54:20.648 --> 00:54:21.524
Boo?

1539
00:54:21.608 --> 00:54:22.643
No, no, no, no.

1540
00:54:22.728 --> 00:54:23.604
It's okay.

1541
00:54:23.688 --> 00:54:24.757
I was just...

1542
00:54:24.848 --> 00:54:25.883
( whiopering in fear )

1543
00:54:25.968 --> 00:54:27.765
No, no, no, no, no,
don't be scared.

1544
00:54:27.848 --> 00:54:29.486
That wasn't real.

1545
00:54:29.568 --> 00:54:30.683
It's just a...

1546
00:54:30.768 --> 00:54:31.803
I was just...

1547
00:54:31.888 --> 00:54:33.116
( crying ):
No...

1548
00:54:35.368 --> 00:54:37.324
( Boo continues crying )

1549
00:54:42.288 --> 00:54:43.607
( Boo sobbing )

1550
00:54:43.688 --> 00:54:44.882
Boo.

1551
00:54:44.968 --> 00:54:46.481
MIKE:
...and he was going
to test it out

1552
00:54:46.568 --> 00:54:48.445
on that sweet,
little girl.

1553
00:54:48.528 --> 00:54:50.246
Boo.
Now that we
have her...

1554
00:54:50.328 --> 00:54:51.477
...he is trying
to kill us.

1555
00:54:51.568 --> 00:54:53.160
This whole thing
is Randall's fault.

1556
00:54:53.248 --> 00:54:54.476
Randall?

1557
00:54:54.568 --> 00:54:56.877
Yes. And we can take
you to his secret lab,
which is right here

1558
00:54:56.968 --> 00:54:57.844
in this factory.

1559
00:54:57.928 --> 00:54:59.122
How could this happen?

1560
00:54:59.208 --> 00:55:01.005
Oh, how could this happen?

1561
00:55:01.088 --> 00:55:03.124
Does anyone else
know about this?

1562
00:55:03.208 --> 00:55:04.084
No, sir.

1563
00:55:04.168 --> 00:55:05.487
Good.

1564
00:55:05.568 --> 00:55:08.321
This company can't afford
any more bad publicity.

1565
00:55:08.408 --> 00:55:12.401
Now, before we do
anything else, let's...

1566
00:55:12.488 --> 00:55:14.718
take care of the child.

1567
00:55:18.008 --> 00:55:21.284
Oh, I never thought things
would come to this...

1568
00:55:21.368 --> 00:55:24.166
not in my factory.

1569
00:55:24.248 --> 00:55:27.320
I'm sorry you boys
got mixed up in this.

1570
00:55:27.408 --> 00:55:28.841
Especially you,James.

1571
00:55:28.928 --> 00:55:30.566
But now we can set

1572
00:55:30.648 --> 00:55:33.958
everything straight again
for the good of the company.

1573
00:55:34.048 --> 00:55:35.083
( whirring )

1574
00:55:35.168 --> 00:55:36.521
( thunk )

1575
00:55:36.608 --> 00:55:37.643
MIKE:
Uh...

1576
00:55:37.728 --> 00:55:39.844
sir, that's not her door.

1577
00:55:39.928 --> 00:55:41.441
I know, I know.

1578
00:55:44.288 --> 00:55:45.323
It's yours.

1579
00:55:45.408 --> 00:55:46.397
( startled gasps )

1580
00:55:46.488 --> 00:55:47.477
( grunts )

1581
00:55:47.568 --> 00:55:49.684
( yelling )

1582
00:55:49.768 --> 00:55:50.564
No!

1583
00:55:51.688 --> 00:55:52.916
( gasps )

1584
00:55:53.008 --> 00:55:56.967
( voice echoing ):
Boo!

1585
00:55:59.968 --> 00:56:00.923
( gasps )

1586
00:56:01.008 --> 00:56:01.963
No! No!

1587
00:56:02.048 --> 00:56:03.925
No! No! No! No!

1588
00:56:04.008 --> 00:56:04.963
No!

1589
00:56:05.048 --> 00:56:06.242
( desperate grunts )

1590
00:56:06.328 --> 00:56:07.238
It's too late!

1591
00:56:07.328 --> 00:56:08.841
We're banished, genius.

1592
00:56:08.928 --> 00:56:10.680
We're in the human world!

1593
00:56:10.768 --> 00:56:13.965
Oh, what a great idea, going
to your old pal Waternoose!

1594
00:56:14.048 --> 00:56:16.118
Too bad he was in
on the whole thing!

1595
00:56:16.208 --> 00:56:19.723
All you had to do was listen
to me--just once!

1596
00:56:19.808 --> 00:56:21.878
But you didn't, did you?

1597
00:56:21.968 --> 00:56:24.323
You're still not listening!

1598
00:56:24.408 --> 00:56:27.081
( yelling )

1599
00:56:27.168 --> 00:56:31.207
( Sulley grunting and groaning )

1600
00:56:31.288 --> 00:56:32.323
Take that!

1601
00:56:32.408 --> 00:56:34.000
( growling )

1602
00:56:34.088 --> 00:56:35.646
( gasps in horror )

1603
00:56:38.248 --> 00:56:40.557
Welcome to the Himalayas!

1604
00:56:40.648 --> 00:56:42.878
( wind gusting )

1605
00:56:42.968 --> 00:56:44.481
''Abominable''!

1606
00:56:44.568 --> 00:56:45.444
( chuckles )

1607
00:56:45.528 --> 00:56:46.722
Can you believe that?

1608
00:56:46.808 --> 00:56:48.526
Do I look abominable to you?

1609
00:56:48.608 --> 00:56:51.406
Why can't they call me
the Adorable Snowman or...

1610
00:56:51.488 --> 00:56:54.207
or the Agreeable Snowman,
for crying out loud?

1611
00:56:54.288 --> 00:56:55.516
I'm a nice guy.

1612
00:56:55.608 --> 00:56:56.802
Snow cone?

1613
00:56:56.888 --> 00:56:57.764
Yuck.

1614
00:56:57.848 --> 00:56:58.678
No, no, no.

1615
00:56:58.768 --> 00:57:00.281
Don't worry--
it's lemon.

1616
00:57:00.368 --> 00:57:02.404
Uh, how about
you, big fella?

1617
00:57:02.488 --> 00:57:04.558
Snow cone?

1618
00:57:04.648 --> 00:57:09.039
Did you see the way she...
looked at me?

1619
00:57:09.128 --> 00:57:10.561
( sighs )

1620
00:57:10.648 --> 00:57:12.400
Ah, poor guy.

1621
00:57:12.488 --> 00:57:13.477
I understand.

1622
00:57:13.568 --> 00:57:15.160
It ain't easy
being banished.

1623
00:57:15.248 --> 00:57:16.442
Take my buddy, Bigfoot.

1624
00:57:16.528 --> 00:57:17.677
When he was banished

1625
00:57:17.768 --> 00:57:20.646
he fashioned an enormous diaper
out of poison ivy.

1626
00:57:20.728 --> 00:57:22.525
Wore it on his head
like a tiara.

1627
00:57:22.608 --> 00:57:24.087
Called himself King Itchy.

1628
00:57:24.168 --> 00:57:26.807
Ah, it won't be so hard for
you guys, though, you know.

1629
00:57:26.888 --> 00:57:28.241
I mean, how lucky
can you get?

1630
00:57:28.328 --> 00:57:29.761
Banished with your
best friend.

1631
00:57:29.848 --> 00:57:31.201
He is not my friend.

1632
00:57:31.288 --> 00:57:33.119
Oh. I just assumed you
were buddies, you know

1633
00:57:33.208 --> 00:57:34.687
when I saw you out
there in the snow

1634
00:57:34.768 --> 00:57:35.644
hugging and all that.

1635
00:57:35.728 --> 00:57:36.683
Look at that big jerk.

1636
00:57:36.768 --> 00:57:38.201
Ruined my life, and for what?

1637
00:57:38.288 --> 00:57:39.323
A stupid kid!

1638
00:57:39.408 --> 00:57:41.239
Because of you,
I am now stuck

1639
00:57:41.328 --> 00:57:42.761
in this frozen
wasteland!

1640
00:57:42.848 --> 00:57:43.758
Wasteland?

1641
00:57:43.848 --> 00:57:46.203
I think you mean wonderland!

1642
00:57:46.288 --> 00:57:48.597
I mean, how about
all this fabulous snow, huh?

1643
00:57:48.688 --> 00:57:51.077
Oh, and wait till you see
the local village.

1644
00:57:51.168 --> 00:57:52.681
Cutest thing in the world.

1645
00:57:52.768 --> 00:57:54.998
I haven't even mentioned
all the free yak's milk.

1646
00:57:55.088 --> 00:57:56.521
What... what did you say?

1647
00:57:56.608 --> 00:57:57.484
Yak's milk.

1648
00:57:57.568 --> 00:57:59.206
Milking a yak
ain't exactly a picnic.

1649
00:57:59.288 --> 00:58:00.926
You know, once you pick
the hairs out

1650
00:58:01.008 --> 00:58:01.963
it's very nutritious.

1651
00:58:02.048 --> 00:58:03.845
No, no. Something
about a village.

1652
00:58:03.928 --> 00:58:05.043
Where?
Are there kids in it?

1653
00:58:05.128 --> 00:58:06.038
Kids? Sure.

1654
00:58:06.128 --> 00:58:07.846
Tough kids, sissy kids,
kids who climb on rocks...

1655
00:58:07.928 --> 00:58:08.804
Where is it?!

1656
00:58:08.888 --> 00:58:10.207
It's at the bottom
of the mountain.

1657
00:58:10.288 --> 00:58:11.357
Around a three-day hike.

1658
00:58:11.448 --> 00:58:12.642
Oh, three days?!

1659
00:58:12.728 --> 00:58:14.047
We need to get there now!

1660
00:58:14.128 --> 00:58:16.244
( thuop )

1661
00:58:18.008 --> 00:58:18.963
( ding )

1662
00:58:24.648 --> 00:58:26.400
You want to go to the village?

1663
00:58:26.488 --> 00:58:28.524
Okay, rule number one
out here.

1664
00:58:28.608 --> 00:58:29.597
Always...

1665
00:58:29.688 --> 00:58:30.757
No.

1666
00:58:30.848 --> 00:58:32.998
Never go out in a blizzard.

1667
00:58:33.088 --> 00:58:34.646
We need to get to Boo.

1668
00:58:34.728 --> 00:58:36.081
( grunts, then gasps )

1669
00:58:36.168 --> 00:58:37.886
Boo?!

1670
00:58:37.968 --> 00:58:39.287
What about us?

1671
00:58:39.368 --> 00:58:40.244
( grunts )

1672
00:58:40.328 --> 00:58:41.920
Ever since that kid
came in

1673
00:58:42.008 --> 00:58:43.327
you've ignored
everything I've said

1674
00:58:43.408 --> 00:58:44.557
and now look where we are!

1675
00:58:45.608 --> 00:58:48.042
Oh, we were about
to break the record, Sulley.

1676
00:58:48.128 --> 00:58:49.561
We would have had it made!

1677
00:58:49.648 --> 00:58:50.763
None of that matters now.

1678
00:58:50.848 --> 00:58:53.237
None of it matter...

1679
00:58:53.328 --> 00:58:54.443
Wa-wait a second.

1680
00:58:54.528 --> 00:58:56.644
None of it matters?

1681
00:58:56.728 --> 00:58:58.207
( sighs )

1682
00:58:58.288 --> 00:58:59.607
MIKE:
Okay.

1683
00:58:59.688 --> 00:59:01.599
That's.... no. Good. Great.

1684
00:59:01.688 --> 00:59:04.248
So, now the truth
comes out, doesn't it?

1685
00:59:04.328 --> 00:59:07.400
Oh, would you
look at that?

1686
00:59:07.488 --> 00:59:09.206
We're out of
snow cones, uh...

1687
00:59:09.288 --> 00:59:10.846
Let me... just go outside

1688
00:59:10.928 --> 00:59:12.077
and make some more.

1689
00:59:12.168 --> 00:59:16.446
Sulley, what about everything
we ever worked for?

1690
00:59:16.528 --> 00:59:19.600
Does that matter?
Huh?

1691
00:59:19.688 --> 00:59:21.519
And what about Celia?

1692
00:59:21.608 --> 00:59:25.203
I am never... never
going to see her again.

1693
00:59:25.288 --> 00:59:26.767
Doesn't that matter?

1694
00:59:30.048 --> 00:59:31.003
( sighs )

1695
00:59:32.208 --> 00:59:33.607
What about me?

1696
00:59:33.688 --> 00:59:35.201
I'm your pal.

1697
00:59:35.288 --> 00:59:37.244
I'm... I'm your best friend.

1698
00:59:37.328 --> 00:59:39.364
Don't I matter?

1699
00:59:41.128 --> 00:59:42.561
( sighs )

1700
00:59:42.648 --> 00:59:43.683
I'm sorry, Mike.

1701
00:59:43.768 --> 00:59:46.566
I'm sorry we're stuck out here.

1702
00:59:46.648 --> 00:59:48.718
I didn't mean
for this to happen.

1703
00:59:48.808 --> 00:59:50.366
But Boo's in trouble.

1704
00:59:50.448 --> 00:59:52.200
I think there might
be a way to save her

1705
00:59:52.288 --> 00:59:53.801
if we can just
get down to that...

1706
00:59:53.888 --> 00:59:54.764
''We''?

1707
00:59:54.848 --> 00:59:56.566
Whoa, whoa, whoa. ''We''?

1708
00:59:56.648 --> 00:59:57.842
No.

1709
00:59:57.928 --> 00:59:59.759
There's no ''we'' this time, pal.

1710
00:59:59.848 --> 01:00:02.043
I-if-if you want
to go out there

1711
01:00:02.128 --> 01:00:03.322
and freeze to death

1712
01:00:03.408 --> 01:00:05.683
you be my guest...

1713
01:00:05.768 --> 01:00:08.601
because you're on your own.

1714
01:00:30.728 --> 01:00:34.084
( wind whistles )

1715
01:00:43.888 --> 01:00:46.402
Hey, I got more snow cones!

1716
01:00:51.448 --> 01:00:52.358
Ohh!

1717
01:00:57.088 --> 01:00:58.043
Ahh!

1718
01:01:04.768 --> 01:01:05.200
Ahh!

1719
01:01:05.288 --> 01:01:06.164
( yells )

1720
01:01:06.248 --> 01:01:09.240
( grunting and groaning )

1721
01:01:12.688 --> 01:01:15.566
( wind howling )

1722
01:01:17.968 --> 01:01:21.165
( distant child screaoing )

1723
01:01:25.168 --> 01:01:28.080
( children screaoing )

1724
01:01:31.408 --> 01:01:32.841
Oh, come on, now, George.

1725
01:01:32.928 --> 01:01:34.486
I know you can do this.

1726
01:01:34.568 --> 01:01:37.560
I picked out an easy door
for you-- in Nepal.

1727
01:01:37.648 --> 01:01:39.639
Nice, quiet Nepal.

1728
01:01:39.728 --> 01:01:41.320
You know, you're right.

1729
01:01:41.408 --> 01:01:42.557
Here, take this.

1730
01:01:42.648 --> 01:01:44.206
Go get 'em, Georgie!

1731
01:01:44.288 --> 01:01:45.926
Gangway! Look out!
Coming through!

1732
01:01:46.008 --> 01:01:47.202
Sorry, George.

1733
01:01:47.288 --> 01:01:48.562
Hey, you can't just...

1734
01:01:48.648 --> 01:01:49.524
( gasps )

1735
01:01:49.608 --> 01:01:50.438
23...

1736
01:01:50.528 --> 01:01:52.166
( gagging )

1737
01:01:55.128 --> 01:01:56.277
( whistling )

1738
01:01:56.368 --> 01:01:57.483
Out of the way!

1739
01:01:57.568 --> 01:01:58.444
-Hey!
-Whoa!

1740
01:01:58.528 --> 01:01:59.927
Don't!

1741
01:02:00.008 --> 01:02:01.566
( gasps )

1742
01:02:01.648 --> 01:02:02.637
( whiopers )

1743
01:02:02.728 --> 01:02:03.922
Finally!

1744
01:02:04.008 --> 01:02:06.124
I never should have
trusted you with this.

1745
01:02:06.208 --> 01:02:08.517
Because of you, I had
to banish my top scarer!

1746
01:02:08.608 --> 01:02:10.838
With this machine,
we won't need scarers.

1747
01:02:10.928 --> 01:02:13.078
Besides, Sullivan got
what he deserved.

1748
01:02:13.168 --> 01:02:16.046
Sullivan was twice the scarer
you will ever be!

1749
01:02:16.128 --> 01:02:17.038
( low growl )

1750
01:02:17.128 --> 01:02:18.197
( panting )

1751
01:02:18.288 --> 01:02:19.164
( clanging )

1752
01:02:19.248 --> 01:02:20.442
( grunting )

1753
01:02:20.528 --> 01:02:21.802
( yells with effort )

1754
01:02:23.568 --> 01:02:26.765
( oechanical whirring )

1755
01:02:26.848 --> 01:02:28.361
( gasps )

1756
01:02:28.448 --> 01:02:30.598
Kitty!

1757
01:02:30.688 --> 01:02:31.723
( whirring and hissing )

1758
01:02:31.808 --> 01:02:33.366
( yelling )

1759
01:02:33.448 --> 01:02:34.676
( shrieking )

1760
01:02:34.768 --> 01:02:35.883
( roaring )

1761
01:02:37.488 --> 01:02:38.284
Kitty!

1762
01:02:38.368 --> 01:02:38.959
Sullivan?

1763
01:02:39.048 --> 01:02:40.276
( grunting )

1764
01:02:43.008 --> 01:02:44.885
Wh-whoa!

1765
01:02:44.968 --> 01:02:46.162
Kitty!

1766
01:02:46.248 --> 01:02:47.317
Sorry, Boo.

1767
01:02:47.408 --> 01:02:48.682
Stop him!

1768
01:02:48.768 --> 01:02:49.803
( growls )

1769
01:02:49.888 --> 01:02:52.243
Let's get you home.

1770
01:02:52.328 --> 01:02:52.885
( panting )

1771
01:02:52.968 --> 01:02:53.844
( blow lands )

1772
01:02:53.928 --> 01:02:54.804
Ooh!

1773
01:02:54.888 --> 01:02:56.162
WATERNOOSE:
Finish him off!

1774
01:02:56.248 --> 01:02:57.158
Oh! Ooh! Oh!

1775
01:02:57.248 --> 01:02:59.079
( clanging )

1776
01:03:00.368 --> 01:03:01.323
( thunk )

1777
01:03:02.848 --> 01:03:04.361
You don't know how long

1778
01:03:04.448 --> 01:03:07.121
I've wanted to do
that, Sullivan.

1779
01:03:07.208 --> 01:03:08.084
( grunts )

1780
01:03:08.168 --> 01:03:09.567
( chuckles )

1781
01:03:09.648 --> 01:03:11.559
( punches landing )

1782
01:03:11.648 --> 01:03:12.558
Hah!

1783
01:03:12.648 --> 01:03:13.364
Ooh!

1784
01:03:13.448 --> 01:03:14.676
( shrieks )

1785
01:03:16.088 --> 01:03:17.726
( panting )

1786
01:03:17.808 --> 01:03:18.718
Ooh!

1787
01:03:18.808 --> 01:03:19.718
Mike?!

1788
01:03:19.808 --> 01:03:21.480
Look, it's not that I
don't care about the kid.

1789
01:03:21.568 --> 01:03:22.796
Mike, you don't
understand.

1790
01:03:22.888 --> 01:03:24.560
Yes, I do. I was
just mad, that's all.

1791
01:03:24.648 --> 01:03:25.922
I needed some time to think.

1792
01:03:26.008 --> 01:03:27.885
But you shouldn't
have left me out there.

1793
01:03:27.968 --> 01:03:28.878
( thuop )

1794
01:03:28.968 --> 01:03:30.287
I'm being attacked!

1795
01:03:30.368 --> 01:03:31.562
No, I'm not attacking you.

1796
01:03:31.648 --> 01:03:32.717
I'm trying to be honest.

1797
01:03:32.808 --> 01:03:33.684
Just hear me out.

1798
01:03:33.768 --> 01:03:34.917
You and I are a team.

1799
01:03:35.008 --> 01:03:37.522
Nothing is more important
than our friendship.

1800
01:03:37.608 --> 01:03:38.484
I-I-I know, kid.

1801
01:03:38.568 --> 01:03:39.683
He's too sensitive.

1802
01:03:39.768 --> 01:03:41.247
( gagging )

1803
01:03:41.328 --> 01:03:42.044
( whining cry )

1804
01:03:42.128 --> 01:03:43.402
Come on, pal.

1805
01:03:43.488 --> 01:03:45.046
If you start crying,
I'm going to cry

1806
01:03:45.128 --> 01:03:46.481
and I'll never get through this.

1807
01:03:46.568 --> 01:03:48.957
I'm sorry
I wasn't there for you

1808
01:03:49.048 --> 01:03:49.924
but I am now.

1809
01:03:50.008 --> 01:03:50.758
Ow!

1810
01:03:50.848 --> 01:03:52.201
Sulley, I am baring
my soul here.

1811
01:03:52.288 --> 01:03:54.279
The least you could do
is pay attention!

1812
01:03:55.288 --> 01:03:56.801
( yells in pain )

1813
01:03:56.888 --> 01:03:58.765
( sighs in relief )

1814
01:03:58.848 --> 01:04:00.964
Hey, look at that--
it's Randall! It's...

1815
01:04:01.048 --> 01:04:01.878
Oh.

1816
01:04:01.968 --> 01:04:03.162
Come on!

1817
01:04:03.248 --> 01:04:04.442
WATERNOOSE:
Get up!

1818
01:04:04.528 --> 01:04:06.325
There can't be
any witnesses.

1819
01:04:06.408 --> 01:04:07.557
There won't be.

1820
01:04:07.648 --> 01:04:09.081
I'm glad you came back, Mike.

1821
01:04:09.168 --> 01:04:11.557
Somebody's gotta take care
of you, you big hair ball.

1822
01:04:11.648 --> 01:04:12.558
( Celia screaoing )

1823

( screaoing )

1824
01:04:14.288 --> 01:04:15.164
Ow!

1825
01:04:15.248 --> 01:04:17.125
Schmoopsie-poo,
I really can't talk.

1826
01:04:17.208 --> 01:04:18.163
Come on!

1827
01:04:18.248 --> 01:04:19.681
Michael, if you
don't tell me

1828
01:04:19.768 --> 01:04:21.884
what's going on right
now, we are through!

1829
01:04:21.968 --> 01:04:23.037
You hear me? Through!

1830
01:04:23.128 --> 01:04:24.197
Here's the truth.

1831
01:04:24.288 --> 01:04:25.926
You know the kid that they're
looking for-- Sulley let her in.

1832
01:04:26.008 --> 01:04:26.918
We tried to
send her back

1833
01:04:27.008 --> 01:04:28.202
but Waternoose
had this secret plot

1834
01:04:28.288 --> 01:04:30.597
and now Randall's right behind
us and he's trying to kill us!

1835
01:04:30.688 --> 01:04:33.805
You expect me to believe that
pack of lies, Mike Wazowski?!

1836
01:04:33.888 --> 01:04:35.116
Mike Wazowski!

1837

1844
01:04:44.488 --> 01:04:45.603
Make way. Move it!

1845
01:04:45.688 --> 01:04:46.882

Huh?

1850
01:04:55.408 --> 01:04:56.284
No, I didn't.

1851
01:04:56.368 --> 01:04:57.403
Get out of my way!

1852

Let me through!

1858
01:05:08.652 --> 01:05:09.641
Sulley,
what are you doing?

1859
01:05:09.732 --> 01:05:10.608
Grab on, Mike!

1860

MIKE:
Sulley, what are we doing?

1865
01:05:22.452 --> 01:05:25.489
We have to get Boo's door
and find a station.

1866
01:05:25.572 --> 01:05:28.962
MIKE:
What a plan--
simple, yet insane!

( growls )

1868
01:05:31.132 --> 01:05:32.406

01:05:52.252 --> 01:05:53.048
Wow!

1875
01:05:53.132 --> 01:05:54.042
Don't look down!

1876

How are we supposed
to get it now?

That's right, Boo.

2000
01:10:32.692 --> 01:10:33.727
You did it.

2001
01:10:33.812 --> 01:10:34.847
You beat him.

01:10:39.372 --> 01:10:41.408
Okay, Boo,
it's time to go home.

2005
01:10:41.492 --> 01:10:43.642
Take care of yourself,
and be a good girl, okay?

2006
01:10:43.732 --> 01:10:44.767
( gasps )

2007
01:10:44.852 --> 01:10:45.841
Oh, no!

2008
01:10:45.932 --> 01:10:46.808
The power's out!

2009
01:10:46.892 --> 01:10:48.245
Make her laugh again.

2010
01:10:48.332 --> 01:10:49.526
All right, I got a move here.

2011
01:10:49.612 --> 01:10:50.806
It'll bring down the house.

2012
01:10:50.892 --> 01:10:51.961
Up...

2013
01:10:52.052 --> 01:10:53.087
( oetallic clang )

2014
01:10:53.172 --> 01:10:54.207
( groans softly )

2015
01:10:54.292 --> 01:10:56.522
Oh, sorry, she didn't see that.

2016
01:10:56.612 --> 01:10:58.045
What?! What'd you do,
forget to check

2017
01:10:58.132 --> 01:10:59.121
if her stupid hood was up

2018
01:10:59.212 --> 01:11:00.281
ya big dope?!

2019
01:11:00.372 --> 01:11:02.567
( singsong ):
Uncle Mike, try not to yell
in front of her.

2020
01:11:02.652 --> 01:11:04.085
You know we still need her
to laugh.

2021
01:11:04.172 --> 01:11:05.048
Right.

2022
01:11:05.132 --> 01:11:06.008
( laughs )

2023
01:11:06.092 --> 01:11:07.650
Hey, Boo, just kidding. Look!

2024
01:11:07.732 --> 01:11:08.608
( gibberish )

2025
01:11:08.692 --> 01:11:10.125
Funny, right? Huh?
See what the...

2026
01:11:10.212 --> 01:11:11.281
These are the jokes, kid.

2027
01:11:11.372 --> 01:11:12.407
Whoa!

2028
01:11:12.492 --> 01:11:14.130
What's happening?

2029
01:11:14.212 --> 01:11:16.442
SULLEY:
Hold on!

2030
01:11:16.532 --> 01:11:19.410
When the door lands
in this station, cut the power.

2031
01:11:19.492 --> 01:11:22.484
You'll have the child
and the criminals responsible

2032
01:11:22.572 --> 01:11:24.847
for this whole mess.

2033
01:11:24.932 --> 01:11:26.809
Great.
A welcoming committee!

2034
01:11:26.892 --> 01:11:28.564
What are we going to do?!

2035
01:11:28.652 --> 01:11:32.167
( electrical huooing )

2036
01:11:34.492 --> 01:11:35.925
( clang )

2037
01:11:39.772 --> 01:11:40.807
This is the CD A.

2038
01:11:40.892 --> 01:11:41.927
Come out slowly

2039
01:11:42.012 --> 01:11:43.525
with the child
in plain sight.

2040
01:11:43.612 --> 01:11:45.762
Okay, okay.

2041
01:11:45.852 --> 01:11:46.728
You got us.

2042
01:11:46.812 --> 01:11:47.801
Here we are.

2043
01:11:47.892 --> 01:11:48.802
Here's the kid.

2044
01:11:48.892 --> 01:11:50.325
I'm cooperating.

2045
01:11:50.412 --> 01:11:52.209
But before you take us away,
I have one thing to say:

2046
01:11:52.292 --> 01:11:53.168
( gags )

2047
01:11:53.252 --> 01:11:54.526
Catch!

2048
01:11:54.612 --> 01:11:56.443
( all shouting ):
231 9!

2049
01:11:56.532 --> 01:11:58.124
We have a toxic
projectile!

2050
01:11:58.212 --> 01:11:59.770
Halt! After the suspect!

2051
01:11:59.852 --> 01:12:01.205
Cover the area!
Bring in reinforcements!

2052
01:12:01.292 --> 01:12:02.691
WATERNOOSE:
Stop him!

2053
01:12:02.772 --> 01:12:05.286
( Boo squeaks )

2054
01:12:05.372 --> 01:12:06.441
Come on.

2055
01:12:06.532 --> 01:12:08.648
Don't let them get away.

2056
01:12:08.732 --> 01:12:09.608
What...?!

2057
01:12:09.692 --> 01:12:10.727
No, wait, wait!

2058
01:12:10.812 --> 01:12:12.370
Come back!
He has the child!

2059
01:12:12.452 --> 01:12:13.646
( frustrated growl )

2060
01:12:15.732 --> 01:12:17.404
( Boo squeaks )

2061
01:12:17.492 --> 01:12:19.881
Sullivan? Sullivan!

2062
01:12:19.972 --> 01:12:21.451
Give me the child!

2063
01:12:21.532 --> 01:12:22.647
Me not go!

2064
01:12:22.732 --> 01:12:23.608
Give her to me!

2065
01:12:24.772 --> 01:12:26.842
( panting )

2066
01:12:26.932 --> 01:12:28.365
( grunts )

2067
01:12:30.172 --> 01:12:31.969
( oetallic creaking )

2068
01:12:32.052 --> 01:12:36.250
WATERNOOSE:
Open this door!
Open this door!

2069
01:12:36.332 --> 01:12:37.924
( growling and pounding )

2070
01:12:38.012 --> 01:12:39.730
Hey!

2071
01:12:39.812 --> 01:12:41.211
Sullivan!

2072
01:12:41.292 --> 01:12:42.122
( yells )

2073
01:12:42.212 --> 01:12:43.884
WATERNOOSE:
Don't do it.

2074
01:12:43.972 --> 01:12:44.643
( beep )

2075
01:12:44.732 --> 01:12:45.403
Come on.

2076
01:12:45.492 --> 01:12:48.370
Don't go in that room!

2077
01:12:48.452 --> 01:12:49.965
( yelling )

2078
01:12:50.052 --> 01:12:52.247
I think we stopped him, Boo.

2079
01:12:52.332 --> 01:12:53.367
You're safe now.

2080
01:12:53.452 --> 01:12:56.524
You be a good girl, okay?

2081
01:12:56.612 --> 01:12:59.001
This has gone
far enough,James.

2082
01:12:59.092 --> 01:13:00.320
She's home now!
Just leave her alone!

2083
01:13:00.412 --> 01:13:01.447
I can't do that!

2084
01:13:01.532 --> 01:13:02.567
She's seen too much.

2085
01:13:02.652 --> 01:13:04.210
You both have.

2086
01:13:04.292 --> 01:13:05.691
It doesn't have to be this way.

2087
01:13:05.772 --> 01:13:07.285
I have no choice!

2088
01:13:07.372 --> 01:13:08.361
Times have changed.

2089
01:13:08.452 --> 01:13:09.965
Scaring isn't enough any more.

2090
01:13:10.052 --> 01:13:11.405
But kidnapping children?!

2091
01:13:11.492 --> 01:13:13.005
I'll kidnap
a thousand children

2092
01:13:13.092 --> 01:13:14.445
before I let
this company die

2093
01:13:14.532 --> 01:13:16.204
and I'll silence anyone

2094
01:13:16.292 --> 01:13:18.044
who gets in my way!

2095
01:13:18.132 --> 01:13:19.360
No!

2096
01:13:19.452 --> 01:13:21.602
( child's voice ):
Good night, Mom.

2097
01:13:21.692 --> 01:13:23.284
( wooan's voice ):
Good night, sweetheart.

2098
01:13:23.372 --> 01:13:24.248
Good night, Mom.

2099
01:13:24.332 --> 01:13:26.482
What, wh-what is this?!
What? Who? Huh?

2100
01:13:26.572 --> 01:13:28.847
COMPUTER:
Simulation terminated.
Simulation terminated.

2101
01:13:28.932 --> 01:13:30.763
Well, I don't know
about the rest of you guys

2102
01:13:30.852 --> 01:13:32.649
but I spotted
several big mistakes.

2103
01:13:32.732 --> 01:13:34.165
But-but-but how-how did...?
How did...?

2104
01:13:34.252 --> 01:13:35.287
MIKE:
You know what?

2105
01:13:35.372 --> 01:13:38.011
Let's watch my favourite part
again... shall we?

2106
01:13:38.092 --> 01:13:41.084
( repeating ):
I'll kidnap a thousand children
before I let this company die.

2107
01:13:41.172 --> 01:13:42.924
What...? Wha...?

2108
01:13:43.012 --> 01:13:44.923
I'll kidnap
a thousand children before...

2109
01:13:45.012 --> 01:13:46.286
( baby talk )

2110
01:13:46.372 --> 01:13:47.725
Shh, shh, shh, shh!

2111
01:13:47.812 --> 01:13:49.211
Shh!

2112
01:13:49.292 --> 01:13:50.168
I'll get him.

2113
01:13:50.252 --> 01:13:51.287
All right,
come with us, sir.

2114
01:13:51.372 --> 01:13:52.441
Wh-what are
you doing?

2115
01:13:52.532 --> 01:13:53.408
Take your
hands off me!

2116
01:13:53.492 --> 01:13:54.527
You can't arrest me!

2117
01:13:54.612 --> 01:13:55.727
I hope you're happy, Sullivan!

2118
01:13:55.812 --> 01:13:58.007
You've destroyed this company.
Monsters, Incorporated is dead!

2119
01:13:58.092 --> 01:14:00.606
Where will everyone
get their scream now?!

2120
01:14:00.692 --> 01:14:02.842
The energy crisis
will only get worse

2121
01:14:02.932 --> 01:14:04.445
because of you!

2122
01:14:04.532 --> 01:14:05.760
( loud clang )

2123
01:14:07.452 --> 01:14:09.602
Stay where you are.

2124
01:14:09.692 --> 01:14:10.522
Huh?

2125
01:14:10.612 --> 01:14:11.931
Number One
wants to talk to you.

2126
01:14:12.012 --> 01:14:14.048
Attention!

2127
01:14:19.812 --> 01:14:21.723
Hello, boys.

2128
01:14:21.812 --> 01:14:22.722
BOTH:
Roz?!

2129
01:14:22.812 --> 01:14:26.566
Two and a half years
of undercover work

2130
01:14:26.652 --> 01:14:28.483
were almost wasted

2131
01:14:28.572 --> 01:14:32.008
when you intercepted
that child, Mr Sullivan.

2132
01:14:32.092 --> 01:14:35.448
Of course, without your help,
I never would have known

2133
01:14:35.532 --> 01:14:38.251
that this went all the way up
to Waternoose.

2134
01:14:38.332 --> 01:14:40.004
( baby talk )

2135
01:14:40.092 --> 01:14:41.571
( gasps )

2136
01:14:41.652 --> 01:14:42.846
ROZ:
Now...

2137
01:14:42.932 --> 01:14:44.411
about the girl...

2138
01:14:44.492 --> 01:14:47.529
I just want to
send her home.

2139
01:14:47.612 --> 01:14:48.681
Very good.

2140
01:14:48.772 --> 01:14:49.807
( chioing tones )

2141
01:14:49.892 --> 01:14:51.484
Bring me a door shredder.

2142
01:14:51.572 --> 01:14:54.484
What, you mean... you mean,
I can't see her again?

2143
01:14:54.572 --> 01:14:57.803
That's the way it has to be.

2144
01:14:57.892 --> 01:15:00.850
I'll give you
five minutes.

2145
01:15:05.732 --> 01:15:07.006
( whirring huo )

2146
01:15:11.012 --> 01:15:12.570
Well, so long, kid.

2147
01:15:12.652 --> 01:15:14.449
Mike Wazowski!

2148
01:15:14.532 --> 01:15:15.885
Yeah.

2149
01:15:15.972 --> 01:15:21.000
Ah, Boo,
it's been fun.

2150
01:15:21.092 --> 01:15:22.286
Go ahead.

2151
01:15:22.372 --> 01:15:24.761
Go grow up.

2152
01:15:30.572 --> 01:15:32.528
( door creaking )

2153
01:15:35.092 --> 01:15:37.242
( squealing in delight )

2154
01:15:37.332 --> 01:15:38.447
( laughing )

2155
01:15:42.732 --> 01:15:43.608
Uh-uh, B-Boo...?

2156
01:15:43.692 --> 01:15:44.568
( speaking baby talk )

2157
01:15:44.652 --> 01:15:45.687
Um... Boo?

2158
01:15:45.772 --> 01:15:47.125
( speaking baby talk )

2159
01:15:47.212 --> 01:15:48.247
Oh, look at that.

2160
01:15:48.332 --> 01:15:50.482
Yeah, you know...

2161
01:15:50.572 --> 01:15:52.244
Oh, that's cute, yeah.

2162
01:15:52.332 --> 01:15:53.321
( baby talk )

2163
01:15:53.412 --> 01:15:54.481
Uh, Boo, um...

2164
01:15:54.572 --> 01:15:55.482
( squeaking toy )

2165
01:15:55.572 --> 01:15:56.925
Well, that's very nice.

2166
01:15:57.012 --> 01:15:58.684
( giggling )

2167
01:15:58.772 --> 01:16:00.046
Come here, you!

2168
01:16:00.132 --> 01:16:01.360
( squeals )

2169
01:16:01.452 --> 01:16:03.408
( both laughing )

2170
01:16:07.932 --> 01:16:10.571
Oh, he's a happy bear...

2171
01:16:10.652 --> 01:16:12.131
( giggling )

2172
01:16:12.212 --> 01:16:14.248
( baby talk )

2173
01:16:16.012 --> 01:16:17.764
Nothing's coming
out of your closet

2174
01:16:17.852 --> 01:16:19.251
to scare you
any more, right?

2175
01:16:19.332 --> 01:16:20.401
Mm...

2176
01:16:20.492 --> 01:16:22.801
Yeah.

2177
01:16:22.892 --> 01:16:25.247
Goodbye, Boo.

2178
01:16:25.332 --> 01:16:27.766
Kitty.

2179
01:16:27.852 --> 01:16:29.922
Kitty has to go.

2180
01:17:08.612 --> 01:17:10.682
Boo!

2181
01:17:10.772 --> 01:17:12.922
( gasps )

2182
01:17:13.012 --> 01:17:15.890
Kitty?

2183
01:17:15.972 --> 01:17:18.247
( ootor buzzing loudly )

2184
01:17:21.652 --> 01:17:22.846
( clicks off )

2185
01:17:22.932 --> 01:17:24.206
None of this

2186
01:17:24.292 --> 01:17:27.090
ever happened, gentlemen.

2187
01:17:27.172 --> 01:17:31.688
And I don't want to see
any paperwork on this.

2188
01:17:34.012 --> 01:17:36.082
( door closes )

2189
01:17:52.412 --> 01:17:54.448
Take him away.

2190
01:17:54.532 --> 01:17:56.363
( all ourouring )

2191
01:17:56.452 --> 01:17:58.283
I bet we get
the rest of the day off.

2192
01:17:58.372 --> 01:17:59.407
You idiot!

2193
01:17:59.492 --> 01:18:01.483
They're going
to shut down the factory!

2194
01:18:01.572 --> 01:18:03.164
( all gasp )

2195
01:18:03.252 --> 01:18:05.208
I'm telling you, pal,
when that wall went up

2196
01:18:05.292 --> 01:18:07.647
you should have seen the look
on Waternoose's face.

2197
01:18:07.732 --> 01:18:09.802
Whoo-hoo! I hope we get
a copy of that tape.

2198
01:18:09.892 --> 01:18:10.961
Hey, you all right?

2199
01:18:11.052 --> 01:18:13.043
Come on, pal,
cheer up, we did it!

2200
01:18:13.132 --> 01:18:14.121
We got Boo home.

2201
01:18:14.212 --> 01:18:16.442
Ah, sure, we put the factory
in the toilet, and...

2202
01:18:16.532 --> 01:18:18.762
gee, hundreds of people
will be out of work now.

2203
01:18:18.852 --> 01:18:21.082
Not to mention the angry mob
that'll come after us

2204
01:18:21.172 --> 01:18:22.969
when there's no more power,
but, hey...

2205
01:18:23.052 --> 01:18:25.930
at least we had
some laughs, right?

2206
01:18:28.012 --> 01:18:30.731
Laughs...

2207
01:18:30.812 --> 01:18:31.961
( crickets chirping )

2208
01:18:32.052 --> 01:18:33.724
( wind blowing softly )

2209
01:18:33.812 --> 01:18:36.451
( door quietly creaks open )

2210
01:18:45.692 --> 01:18:46.841
( boy gasps )

2211
01:18:49.292 --> 01:18:50.691
Hey, is this thing on?
Hello?

2212
01:18:50.772 --> 01:18:52.364
Hello?
Testing, testing.

2213
01:18:52.452 --> 01:18:53.771
Hey, good evening.
How are you?

2214
01:18:53.852 --> 01:18:55.080
How are you?
Nice to see you.

2215
01:18:55.172 --> 01:18:57.083
I tell you, it's good
to be here in... your room.

2216
01:18:57.172 --> 01:18:58.241
Where you from?

2217
01:18:58.332 --> 01:18:59.481
Never mind.

2218
01:18:59.572 --> 01:19:01.483
You're in
kindergarten, right?

2219
01:19:01.572 --> 01:19:02.607
Oh, I love kindergarten.

2220
01:19:02.692 --> 01:19:04.364
Best three years of my life.

2221
01:19:05.332 --> 01:19:06.651
Of my life.

2222
01:19:06.732 --> 01:19:07.608
But I love sports.

2223
01:19:07.692 --> 01:19:08.886
Dodgeball was the best.

2224
01:19:08.972 --> 01:19:09.848
Oh, yeah.

2225
01:19:09.932 --> 01:19:11.285
I was the fastest one out there.

2226
01:19:11.372 --> 01:19:12.930
Course I was the ball.

2227
01:19:13.012 --> 01:19:14.650
But I...

2228
01:19:14.732 --> 01:19:16.165
was the ball, see?

2229
01:19:16.252 --> 01:19:17.844
All right.

2230
01:19:21.892 --> 01:19:23.405
( ruobling )

2231
01:19:23.492 --> 01:19:24.925
( ruobling gets louder )

2232
01:19:25.012 --> 01:19:26.127
( gurgling )

2233
01:19:26.212 --> 01:19:28.043
Ah...

2234
01:19:28.132 --> 01:19:29.247
( huge burp )

2235
01:19:29.332 --> 01:19:30.401
Ah?

2236
01:19:30.492 --> 01:19:31.925
( laughing )

2237
01:19:32.012 --> 01:19:33.127
Hey, thanks a lot.

2238
01:19:33.212 --> 01:19:34.281
I'll be here all week.

2239
01:19:34.372 --> 01:19:35.964
Remember to tip your waitresses.

2240
01:19:36.052 --> 01:19:37.690
( guffawing )

2241
01:19:37.772 --> 01:19:39.046
( rippling gurgle )

2242
01:19:39.132 --> 01:19:40.281
( bell dings )

2243
01:19:40.372 --> 01:19:41.600
Great job, Mikey.

2244
01:19:41.692 --> 01:19:43.808
You filled your quota on
the first kid of the day.

2245
01:19:43.892 --> 01:19:44.881
Not bad, huh?

2246
01:19:44.972 --> 01:19:47.042
You know, only somebody
with perfect comedic timing

2247
01:19:47.132 --> 01:19:48.804
could produce this much energy
in one shot.

2248
01:19:48.892 --> 01:19:50.325
Uh-huh, and the fact
that laughter is

2249
01:19:50.412 --> 01:19:51.845
ten times more
powerful than scream

2250
01:19:51.932 --> 01:19:52.967
had nothing to do with it.

2251
01:19:53.052 --> 01:19:54.041
( clears throat )

2252
01:19:54.132 --> 01:19:55.360
CELIA:
Oh, Googley Bear.

2253
01:19:55.452 --> 01:19:57.647
Come here, you.

2254
01:19:57.732 --> 01:19:58.608
Schmoopsie-poo!

2255
01:19:58.692 --> 01:19:59.602
Googley.

2256
01:19:59.692 --> 01:20:00.681
Whoa!

2257
01:20:00.772 --> 01:20:01.807
( snakes chittering )

2258
01:20:01.892 --> 01:20:02.927
( Mike giggling )

2259
01:20:03.012 --> 01:20:03.967
Girls!
Girls, put...

2260
01:20:04.052 --> 01:20:06.168
Stop, stop, stop!

2261
01:20:06.252 --> 01:20:08.447
Michael,
you're such a charmer.

2262
01:20:08.532 --> 01:20:09.760
Hey, did you bring
the magazine?

2263
01:20:09.852 --> 01:20:11.080
They just delivered
a whole box.

2264
01:20:11.172 --> 01:20:12.048
Let me see it!

2265
01:20:12.132 --> 01:20:13.201
( laughing )

2266
01:20:13.292 --> 01:20:14.691
Sulley and I
made the cover, right?

2267
01:20:14.772 --> 01:20:17.923
( whispering ):
I don't believe it.

2268
01:20:18.012 --> 01:20:19.525
( syopathetically ):
~Googley Bear...

2269
01:20:19.612 --> 01:20:22.809
I'm on the cover
of a magazine!

2270
01:20:22.892 --> 01:20:24.245
Ow!

2271
01:20:24.332 --> 01:20:25.606
( chattering )

2272
01:20:27.052 --> 01:20:28.565
( jittering blubbers )

2273
01:20:28.652 --> 01:20:30.643
Oh, this is great!

2274
01:20:30.732 --> 01:20:33.007
( huooing happily )

2275
01:20:33.092 --> 01:20:34.810
( child laughing uproariously )

2276
01:20:34.892 --> 01:20:35.881
( bell dings )

2277
01:20:35.972 --> 01:20:38.645
Oh.

2278
01:20:41.292 --> 01:20:43.522
( distant laughter )

2279
01:20:43.612 --> 01:20:44.931
( kazoo whirs )

2280
01:20:45.012 --> 01:20:46.843
( toy horn toots )

2281
01:20:55.972 --> 01:20:57.007
MIKE:
Hey, Sulley!

2282
01:20:57.092 --> 01:20:58.207
( yells )

2283
01:20:58.292 --> 01:20:59.361
Hey, uh, Mike.
I was, uh, just...

2284
01:20:59.452 --> 01:21:00.521
Well, listen,
if you got a minute

2285
01:21:00.612 --> 01:21:01.840
there's something
I want to show you.

2286
01:21:01.932 --> 01:21:02.808
But-but-but...

2287
01:21:02.892 --> 01:21:03.768
Okay, close your eyes.

2288
01:21:03.852 --> 01:21:04.841
Follow me.
Come on.

2289
01:21:04.932 --> 01:21:05.808
I-I-I...

2290
01:21:05.892 --> 01:21:06.961
No peeking.

2291
01:21:07.052 --> 01:21:08.485
Keep coming,
keep coming,
keep coming.

2292
01:21:08.572 --> 01:21:09.607
Come on,
keep coming.

2293
01:21:09.692 --> 01:21:10.727
Keep coming,
keep coming.

2294
01:21:10.812 --> 01:21:11.847
Mike...

2295
01:21:11.932 --> 01:21:13.365
Follow the sultry
sound of my voice.

2296
01:21:13.452 --> 01:21:14.328
Okay, stop.

2297
01:21:14.412 --> 01:21:15.367
Open them.

2298
01:21:16.532 --> 01:21:18.170
Ta-da!

2299
01:21:18.252 --> 01:21:19.890
Mike...

2300
01:21:19.972 --> 01:21:21.121
is that...?

2301
01:21:21.212 --> 01:21:22.406
Sorry it took

2302
01:21:22.492 --> 01:21:23.527
so long, pal.

2303
01:21:23.612 --> 01:21:25.921
It was a lot of wood
to go through.

2304
01:21:26.012 --> 01:21:27.491
You know,
it only works

2305
01:21:27.572 --> 01:21:29.528
if you have
every piece.

2306
01:21:42.292 --> 01:21:44.044
( whirring huo )

2307
01:21:52.932 --> 01:21:55.207
( creaking )

2308
01:21:55.292 --> 01:21:57.283
Boo?

2309
01:21:57.372 --> 01:21:59.090
BOO:
Kitty!

2310
01:22:07.416 --> 01:22:09.691
( bouncy blues oelody plays )

2311
01:22:09.776 --> 01:22:10.845
-Speed.
-Marker.

2312
01:22:10.936 --> 01:22:11.925
And... action.

2313
01:22:12.016 --> 01:22:15.611
SULLEY:
If I were a rich man

2314
01:22:15.696 --> 01:22:19.450
With a million or two

2315
01:22:19.536 --> 01:22:22.369
MIKE:
I'd live in
a penthouse

2316
01:22:22.456 --> 01:22:26.813
In a room
with a view

2317
01:22:26.896 --> 01:22:28.568
And if I were handsome

2318
01:22:28.656 --> 01:22:29.532
No way.

2319
01:22:29.616 --> 01:22:30.765
It could happen.

2320
01:22:30.856 --> 01:22:34.815
Those dreams
do come true

2321
01:22:34.896 --> 01:22:38.809
I wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have you

2322
01:22:38.896 --> 01:22:42.571
Wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have

2323
01:22:42.656 --> 01:22:46.126
Wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have

2324
01:22:46.216 --> 01:22:48.810
Wouldn't have nothing...

2325
01:22:48.896 --> 01:22:49.885
( giggling )

2326
01:22:49.976 --> 01:22:50.886
DIRECTOR:
Okay, cut.

2327
01:22:50.976 --> 01:22:53.570
( flushing )

2328
01:22:53.656 --> 01:22:55.806
Okay, you finished
now, right?

2329
01:22:55.896 --> 01:22:56.772
Hello?

2330
01:22:56.856 --> 01:22:57.732
Hello.

2331
01:22:57.816 --> 01:22:58.692
( yells )

2332
01:22:58.776 --> 01:22:59.731
( laughs )

2333
01:22:59.816 --> 01:23:01.408
( both laugh )

2334
01:23:01.496 --> 01:23:02.565
Come on, get lost, you two.

2335
01:23:02.656 --> 01:23:03.975
You're making him
lose his focus.

2336
01:23:04.056 --> 01:23:04.932
Oh, sorry.

2337
01:23:05.016 --> 01:23:06.210
See you later, fellas.

2338
01:23:06.296 --> 01:23:07.331
Go get 'em, Mr Solomon.

2339
01:23:07.416 --> 01:23:08.292
You idiot!

2340
01:23:08.376 --> 01:23:09.365
It's Sullivan, not Solomon!

2341
01:23:09.456 --> 01:23:10.332
What?

2342
01:23:10.416 --> 01:23:11.326
You're messing up the scene!

2343
01:23:11.416 --> 01:23:12.292
Sorry.

2344
01:23:12.376 --> 01:23:13.775
We're never going to work
in Hollywood again!

2345
01:23:13.856 --> 01:23:14.732
Let me do it over.

2346
01:23:14.816 --> 01:23:15.692
Shut up!

2347
01:23:15.776 --> 01:23:16.652
Keep rolling!

2348
01:23:16.736 --> 01:23:17.646
You're making it worse!

2349
01:23:17.736 --> 01:23:19.772
JERRY:
Duck and cover, people!

2350
01:23:22.456 --> 01:23:25.050
( squeaking )

2351
01:23:25.136 --> 01:23:26.046
Hey, thanks, guys.

2352
01:23:26.136 --> 01:23:27.285
That was a close one.

2353
01:23:27.376 --> 01:23:32.450
( yelling )

2354
01:23:32.536 --> 01:23:34.606
Ta-da!

2355
01:23:34.696 --> 01:23:37.369
( all laughing )

2356
01:23:37.456 --> 01:23:40.129
Oh, Boo, it's been fun.

2357
01:23:42.496 --> 01:23:43.724
Go ahead.

2358
01:23:43.816 --> 01:23:45.568
Go throw up.

2359
01:23:45.656 --> 01:23:46.566
( Boo giggles )

2360
01:23:46.656 --> 01:23:48.089
What?
What did I say?

2361
01:23:48.176 --> 01:23:49.052
What? What?

2362
01:23:49.136 --> 01:23:50.091
Cut.

2363
01:23:51.736 --> 01:23:52.612
Hey, Ted!

2364
01:23:52.696 --> 01:23:53.651
Good morning!

2365
01:23:53.736 --> 01:23:54.771
( unrealistic roaring )

2366
01:23:54.856 --> 01:23:55.766
Cut.

2367
01:23:55.856 --> 01:23:57.209
Hey, how was that?
Was I scary?

2368
01:23:57.296 --> 01:23:58.206
Do I get the part?

2369
01:23:58.296 --> 01:23:59.206
Thank you.

2370
01:23:59.296 --> 01:24:00.206
Can I do it again?

2371
01:24:00.296 --> 01:24:01.206
I can be taller!

2372
01:24:01.296 --> 01:24:02.206
Next!

2373
01:24:02.296 --> 01:24:04.207
And action!

2374
01:24:04.296 --> 01:24:05.934
Okay, let's move.
Let's move, let's move!

2375
01:24:06.016 --> 01:24:06.892
( yelling )

2376
01:24:06.976 --> 01:24:07.852
( loud crash )

2377
01:24:07.936 --> 01:24:08.812
Ow!

2378
01:24:08.896 --> 01:24:10.090
( laughter )

2379
01:24:10.176 --> 01:24:12.815
Can we get a little more wax
on the floor, please?

2380
01:24:12.896 --> 01:24:13.806
Wait a minute.
Randall?

2381
01:24:13.896 --> 01:24:14.806
That cheater!

2382
01:24:14.896 --> 01:24:16.614
He's trying
to boost his numbers!

2383
01:24:16.696 --> 01:24:17.924
There's something else.

2384
01:24:18.016 --> 01:24:18.892
What?!

2385
01:24:18.976 --> 01:24:21.285
Look-lay in the bag-bay.

2386
01:24:21.376 --> 01:24:23.526
I think you mean
''Ook-lay in the ag-bay.''

2387
01:24:23.616 --> 01:24:24.685
What? Didn't I...?

2388
01:24:24.776 --> 01:24:26.573
Well, you know, maybe
you should just take a minute

2389
01:24:26.656 --> 01:24:27.611
and ead-ray
your ipt-scray.

2390
01:24:27.696 --> 01:24:28.572
( chuckles )

2391
01:24:28.656 --> 01:24:31.011
You think he's in going
to come through the closet

2392
01:24:31.096 --> 01:24:31.972
and scare you.

2393
01:24:32.056 --> 01:24:33.728
Oh, boy, how do I explain this?

2394
01:24:33.816 --> 01:24:34.965
Uh, it's empty.

2395
01:24:35.056 --> 01:24:36.045
See?

2396
01:24:36.136 --> 01:24:37.569
Guess who.

2397
01:24:37.656 --> 01:24:41.126
( laughter )

2398
01:24:41.216 --> 01:24:42.569
Action.

2399
01:24:47.176 --> 01:24:48.325
Hey, what's the...

2400
01:24:48.416 --> 01:24:49.405
( laughing )

2401
01:24:49.496 --> 01:24:50.451
( chuckles )

2402
01:24:50.536 --> 01:24:51.605
Okay, very funny.

2403
01:24:51.696 --> 01:24:53.493
Hey, I look good in a suit.

2404
01:24:53.576 --> 01:24:54.326
Marker.

2405
01:24:54.416 --> 01:24:55.405
And action.

2406
01:24:55.496 --> 01:24:57.373
Let her rip.

2407
01:24:57.456 --> 01:24:58.571
Go.

2408
01:24:58.656 --> 01:25:00.567
( loud whirring )

2409
01:25:00.656 --> 01:25:01.532
Whoa!

2410
01:25:01.616 --> 01:25:03.652
Shut it off!
Shut it off!

2411
01:25:03.736 --> 01:25:04.691
( yelling )

2412
01:25:04.776 --> 01:25:06.209
Pull the lever!

2413
01:25:06.296 --> 01:25:07.445
( yells )

2414
01:25:07.536 --> 01:25:09.606
You're making it worse!

2415
01:25:11.496 --> 01:25:14.613
MIKE:
But I must admit it

2416
01:25:14.696 --> 01:25:18.974
Big guy, you
always come through

2417
01:25:19.056 --> 01:25:24.050
I wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have you

2418
01:25:26.256 --> 01:25:29.771
BOTH:
You and me together

2419
01:25:29.856 --> 01:25:33.485
That's how it
always should be

2420
01:25:33.576 --> 01:25:39.333
One without the other
don't mean nothing to me

2421
01:25:39.416 --> 01:25:42.089
Nothing to me...

2422
01:25:42.176 --> 01:25:43.165
Oh, hey!

2423
01:25:43.256 --> 01:25:45.816
We're rehearsing a scene

Or I'll poke myself

2433
01:26:01.576 --> 01:26:03.248
It's a work in progress.

2434
01:26:03.336 --> 01:26:05.008
It's gonna get better.

2435
01:26:07.776 --> 01:26:09.095

2443
01:26:21.176 --> 01:26:22.245

I just gotta cry...

2451
01:26:35.136 --> 01:26:36.967
Your seat is right
over there, sir.

2452
01:26:37.056 --> 01:26:38.489
Boo!

2453
01:26:38.576 --> 01:26:40.134
There's a child,
there's a child

2454
01:26:40.216 --> 01:26:41.365
There's a human child

2455
01:26:41.456 --> 01:26:42.332
Oh, no!

2456
01:26:42.416 --> 01:26:43.451
Running
'round the restaurant

2457
01:26:43.536 --> 01:26:44.412
This is really wild

2458
01:26:44.496 --> 01:26:45.372
( screaoing )

2459
01:26:45.456 --> 01:26:47.094
What in heaven's name
will become of us?

2460
01:26:47.176 --> 01:26:49.406
We who are living
in Monstropolis?

2461
01:26:49.496 --> 01:26:50.929
( tinkling crash )

2462
01:26:51.016 --> 01:26:52.813
( piano segues to ballad )

2463
01:26:52.896 --> 01:26:54.648
All right, Wazowski.

2464
01:26:54.736 --> 01:26:57.045
Tell us where the kid is.

2465
01:26:57.136 --> 01:26:58.774
( booing and hissing )

2466
01:26:58.856 --> 01:27:00.574
I will never talk!

2467
01:27:00.656 --> 01:27:01.611
Never!

2468
01:27:03.976 --> 01:27:06.968
She's out of our hair

2469
01:27:07.056 --> 01:27:09.012
( light applause and whistles )

2470
01:27:09.096 --> 01:27:13.931
And just when I dare...
to care

2471
01:27:14.016 --> 01:27:17.213
She says, ''au contraire''

2472
01:27:17.296 --> 01:27:21.289
You're my pair...
of friends

2473
01:27:21.376 --> 01:27:22.286
I love you.

2474
01:27:22.376 --> 01:27:23.331
( sobbing loudly )

2475
01:27:23.416 --> 01:27:24.895
Keep it together, man!

2476
01:27:24.976 --> 01:27:31.495
And so we put that kid
back where she came from

2477
01:27:31.576 --> 01:27:34.329
And she helped us to find

2478
01:27:34.416 --> 01:27:40.651
A better tomorrow today!

2479
01:27:40.736 --> 01:27:42.089
Thank you!

2480
01:27:42.176 --> 01:27:44.371
What a night for my mother
to be in the audience!

2481
01:27:44.456 --> 01:27:45.332
Ladies and gentlemen

2482
01:27:45.416 --> 01:27:46.292
my mom!

2483
01:27:46.376 --> 01:27:48.492
( whistling loudly )

2484
01:27:48.576 --> 01:27:51.568
Thank you, Monstropolis!

2485
01:27:51.656 --> 01:27:54.329
BOTH:
I don't have to say it

2486
01:27:54.416 --> 01:27:55.451
SULLEY:
Ah, say it anyway.

2487
01:27:55.536 --> 01:27:56.412
MIKE:
'Cause we...

2488
01:27:56.496 --> 01:27:59.010
Both know it's true

2489
01:27:59.096 --> 01:28:03.612
I wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have

2490
01:28:03.696 --> 01:28:07.211
I wouldn't have
nothing if I didn't have

2491
01:28:07.296 --> 01:28:11.414
I wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have you

2492
01:28:11.496 --> 01:28:17.526
Wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have you.

2493
01:28:17.616 --> 01:28:18.492
( ousic ends )

2494
01:28:18.576 --> 01:28:20.453
One more time.

2495
01:28:20.536 --> 01:28:22.208
( ousic begins again )

2496
01:28:22.296 --> 01:28:23.172
It worked!

2497
01:28:23.256 --> 01:28:24.894
I don't have to say it

2498
01:28:24.976 --> 01:28:26.250
I'm gonna anyway!

2499
01:28:26.336 --> 01:28:28.327
'Cause we both
know it's true

2500
01:28:28.416 --> 01:28:30.247
Let's take it
home, big guy.

2501
01:28:30.336 --> 01:28:34.249
BOTH:
I wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have

2502
01:28:34.336 --> 01:28:37.726
I wouldn't have
nothing if I didn't have

2503
01:28:37.816 --> 01:28:41.968
I wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have you

2504
01:28:42.056 --> 01:28:43.648
You, you

2505
01:28:43.736 --> 01:28:44.725
A, E, I, O...

2506
01:28:44.816 --> 01:28:46.772
That means you, yeah.

2507
01:28:46.856 --> 01:28:48.050
( ousic ends )
