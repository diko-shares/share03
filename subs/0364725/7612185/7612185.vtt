00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:29.310
<i>Tired of the same old you?</i>

2
00:00:29.404 --> 00:00:34.319
<i>Tired of being out of shape
and out of luck with the opposite sex?</i>

3
00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:37.151
<i>Tired of being overweight
and under-attractive?</i>

4
00:00:37.246 --> 00:00:40.034
Yeah! Oh. Hello!

5
00:00:40.123 --> 00:00:42.330
I'm White Goodman...

6
00:00:42.417 --> 00:00:46.331
owner, operator and founder
of Globo Gym America Corp...

7
00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:50.506
and I'm here to tell ya that you don't
have to be stuck with what ya got.

8
00:00:50.592 --> 00:00:53.129
Hey, Rory. Looking good.

9
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.427
Here at Globo Gym,
we understand that...

10
00:00:55.514 --> 00:00:58.757
“ugliness” and “fatness”
are genetic disorders...

11
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.217
much like baldness
or necrophilia...

12
00:01:01.311 --> 00:01:05.350
and it's only your fault if you don't
hate yourself enough to do something about it.

13
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.647
And that's where we come in.

14
00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:11.352
Globo Gym employs
a highly-trained...

15
00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:15.531
quasi-cultural staff of
personal alteration specialists.

16
00:01:15.617 --> 00:01:18.609
And with our competitively-priced
on-site cosmetic surgery...

17
00:01:18.704 --> 00:01:22.197
we can turn that Frankenstein
you see in the mirror every morning...

18
00:01:22.291 --> 00:01:24.783
into a Franken-fine!

19
00:01:24.876 --> 00:01:27.083
Of course, you'll still be you
in a legal sense...

20
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.878
but think of it as a thinner,
more attractive, better you...

21
00:01:29.965 --> 00:01:32.002
than you could ever become
without us.

22
00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:36.006
How do I know? Well, I'm not only
the founder of Globo Gym.

23
00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:38.053
I'm also a client.

24
00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:43.308
<i>That's me six years
and 600 pounds ago...</i>

25
00:01:43.395 --> 00:01:45.477
<i>before I knew
how much I hated myself.</i>

26
00:01:45.564 --> 00:01:48.431
<i>That all changed once I founded Globo Gym.</i>

27
00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:50.516
<i>But don't just take
my word for it.</i>

28
00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:53.478
<i>Listen to these Globo Gymers
tell you how it is.</i>

29
00:01:53.572 --> 00:01:56.940
Mmm.

30
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.368
That feels good.

31
00:02:01.455 --> 00:02:04.823
Oh, that tickle machine.

32
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.044
Crash, no!
Crash, out! Bad dog!

33
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.964
No grundle.

34
00:02:14.051 --> 00:02:16.258
<i>Come on down and join the winning team.</i>

35
00:02:16.345 --> 00:02:19.588
Because here at Globo Gym,
we're better than you...

36
00:02:19.681 --> 00:02:21.888
and we know it!

37
00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:24.888
Spare me.

38
00:02:32.527 --> 00:02:35.861
<i>Mr. La Fleur, this is Doris
from the Department of Water and Power.</i>

39
00:02:35.947 --> 00:02:39.531
<i>We've been trying to reach you for some
time now, but your phone was disconnected.</i>

40
00:02:39.618 --> 00:02:42.531
<i>I'm calling to inform you that we'll be
shutting off your water and power...</i>

41
00:02:42.621 --> 00:02:45.283
<i>at 5:00 p.m. today due to
an eight-month-overdue account.</i>

42
00:02:45.374 --> 00:02:48.537
<i>Thank you, and have a nice day.</i>

43
00:02:48.627 --> 00:02:50.618
<i>This is Seth from Videorama.</i>

44
00:02:50.712 --> 00:02:52.953
<i>The following DVDs
are now overdue:</i>

45
00:02:53.048 --> 00:02:57.884
Drunken Hussies 3, Backdoor Patrol 5
<i>and</i> Mona Lisa Smile.

46
00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:00.210
<i>Thank you.</i>

47
00:03:14.528 --> 00:03:17.441
Come on, baby. Be there. Be there.

48
00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.663
It's gonna be a good day.
I'm proud of you.

49
00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:40.417
<i>We're just around the corner.
My gym's right here.</i>

50
00:03:40.512 --> 00:03:42.503
I promise.
We're almost there.

51
00:03:42.597 --> 00:03:44.588
Here we go.

52
00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:47.015
You guys are lifesavers.
I appreciate the effort.

53
00:03:47.102 --> 00:03:49.469
Don't pull a hammy over it.
Perfect.

54
00:03:54.943 --> 00:03:58.402
Give me that garbage.
Shouldn't you be on the treadmill?

55
00:04:00.532 --> 00:04:03.320
- <i>Buenas días, O.</i>
- Hey, Peter.

56
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.119
- How's my little tax shelter this morning?
- Everything's shipshape.

57
00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:10.323
Don't hold out on me.
What's happening?

58
00:04:10.417 --> 00:04:12.909
Well, it's just...

59
00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:15.836
- I'm trying this new voice mail
dating thing, you know.
- Right.

60
00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:20.211
And, like, no one's even left me a message,
and it's been almost two months.

61
00:04:20.302 --> 00:04:22.919
Well, keep your chin up.
There's someone out there for everybody.

62
00:04:23.013 --> 00:04:24.674
- You think?
- Absolutely.

63
00:04:24.765 --> 00:04:27.223
You know, in some cases, there's two
somebodies for one person.

64
00:04:27.309 --> 00:04:31.018
I like to call that the jackpot.
See ya later, dater.

65
00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:35.181
- <i>Hey, Peter!</i>
- Hey, Gordon.

66
00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:37.437
Hey, buddy. I'm really wailin'
on my glutes this morning.

67
00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:39.689
- Sounds great, Gord.
- Yeah, I'm gonna shock the biceps later.

68
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.488
Finish up with some cardio. You know,
change it up, keep the body guessing.

69
00:04:42.574 --> 00:04:45.111
- That's always been my approach.
I like to keep my body guessing.
- Sure. That's right.

70
00:04:45.202 --> 00:04:48.445
Hey, I wanted to ask you something.
You catch the game last night?

71
00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:52.247
- Can I say yes to you?
- Amateur Curling Championships on ESPN 8.

72
00:04:52.334 --> 00:04:55.918
- I had no idea.
- You missed a doozy. Really great stuff.

73
00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:59.213
I feel dumb for asking this, but how
do you hear about these things?

74
00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:03.588
- <i>O.S.Q. Obscure Sports Quarterly.</i>
- Of course, the <i>O.S.Q.</i>

75
00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:06.887
- Started reading it in college,
you know, for the chicks.
- Glad that worked out for you.

76
00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:09.260
- Thanks very much. Bye-bye.
- My pleasure.

77
00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:11.433
- Love the orange and love the headphones.
- Thank you very much, Pete.

78
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.602
- When I come back, I wanna
see you on a different machine.
- You got it, buddy!

79
00:05:13.688 --> 00:05:18.307
Get this- Ow! Ow!

80
00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:21.644
- You need a spot?
- I'm cool, Pete. Hey.

81
00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:23.775
Okay, come on.
Let's get this out of here.

82
00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:26.323
You okay? You're like a human
Chinese puzzle.

83
00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:29.071
- Here. And we're not gonna get hurt.
- Thanks, Pete.

84
00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:31.494
What are you doin' with all
that weight anyway? It's dangerous.

85
00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:34.039
It'll be worth it when I
make the cheerleading squad this time...

86
00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:36.116
prove to Amber and everyone else
that I'm not a loser.

87
00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:38.623
Okay, hang on a second.
You wanna become a cheerleader...

88
00:05:38.713 --> 00:05:41.000
to prove to a girl that
you are <i>not</i> a loser?

89
00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:43.583
Yeah. What?

90
00:05:43.677 --> 00:05:46.465
Nothing. Just high school's changed
a little bit since I was a kid.

91
00:05:46.555 --> 00:05:48.592
Plus, all anyone
ever remembers...

92
00:05:48.682 --> 00:05:50.673
is what happened
at last year's tryouts.

93
00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:52.758
I'm the laughingstock
of the school.

94
00:05:52.853 --> 00:05:56.266
I'm sure it's not that big of a deal.
What happened at last year's tryouts?

95
00:05:58.066 --> 00:06:01.149
Justin Redman,
ready and super-psyched!

96
00:06:01.236 --> 00:06:04.854
- Hey, Amber.
- Hi, Justin. Good luck.

97
00:06:04.948 --> 00:06:09.488
Uh, good luck to you
making, uh, your judgments.

98
00:06:09.578 --> 00:06:12.491
And from the girls' line,
we need girl number...

99
00:06:12.581 --> 00:06:15.118
double zero,
Martha Johnstone.

100
00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:18.121
- Whoo!
- Aah!

101
00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:20.623
Whoo!

102
00:06:20.714 --> 00:06:22.546
Whoo!

103
00:06:22.632 --> 00:06:25.124
<i>Toss to hands,
liberty and cradle out, okay?</i>

104
00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:28.593
I'm not wearing
any panties.

105
00:06:31.016 --> 00:06:33.223
Ready?
One, two.

106
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:37.053
<i>Liberty, ready?</i>

107
00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:51.154
Dude!

108
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.201
- Wow.
- Yeah.

109
00:07:01.296 --> 00:07:03.788
- It was the worst.
- Look, Justin.

110
00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:07.591
Don't worry so much about this Amber
situation. It'll all work itself out in the end.

111
00:07:07.677 --> 00:07:11.466
- Thanks, Pete.
- You'll laugh at this one day. I'm laughing already.

112
00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:14.514
Go at your own pace.
That's what it's there for.

113
00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:16.683
Ow!

114
00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.307
- Who goes there?
- It's me. It's Peter. It's Peter.

115
00:07:19.397 --> 00:07:21.559
- Oi, Peter.
- Yeah.

116
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.732
Oh!

117
00:07:25.362 --> 00:07:28.150
'Tis about the matter
of payment for me membership.

118
00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:30.230
Steve be a touch short
this month.

119
00:07:30.325 --> 00:07:32.487
That's all right, Steve.
just pay me when you get the money.

120
00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:34.909
The dread pirate Steve
be in no man's debt.

121
00:07:34.996 --> 00:07:36.987
I'll make a barter with you
true as the North Star.

122
00:07:37.082 --> 00:07:38.993
- Right.
- In exchange for your kindness...

123
00:07:39.084 --> 00:07:41.917
I'll be splittin'
me buried treasure with you.

124
00:07:42.003 --> 00:07:45.212
Once I find it, that be.

125
00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:47.505
That's not gonna be necessary.
I'm flattered by the gesture...

126
00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:50.505
but honestly just, you know, a couple bucks
here and there, I think we'll be fine.

127
00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:55.385
- Thanks, Peter. I'll be on the StairMaster.
- Okay, Steve.

128
00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:57.557
Next time, maybe just
say hello, that's all.

129
00:07:57.644 --> 00:08:00.682
Okay.

130
00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:07.518
- Hello.
- Oh.

131
00:08:07.612 --> 00:08:10.980
It's actually not my birthday
till next month, but terrific.

132
00:08:11.074 --> 00:08:15.113
I'm so sorry. Hi. I'm Katherine Veatch
with Hawthorne Stone.

133
00:08:15.203 --> 00:08:16.864
Oh.

134
00:08:16.955 --> 00:08:20.448
- Your bank.
- Right. My bank.

135
00:08:20.542 --> 00:08:23.284
Well, you are very attractive
for a banker.

136
00:08:23.378 --> 00:08:25.836
- Thank you. I'm not a banker. I'm a lawyer.
- Really?

137
00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:28.334
And what kind of law
are you involved in, pretty eyes?

138
00:08:28.425 --> 00:08:30.007
Sexual harassment, mostly.

139
00:08:30.093 --> 00:08:32.209
- Oh.
- But I also handle...

140
00:08:32.303 --> 00:08:35.261
real estate and tax law,
which is why I'm here.

141
00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:38.841
- Hang on a second. You're saying
this place here is in default?
- No. You're in foreclosure.

142
00:08:38.935 --> 00:08:41.927
You were in default during the six months
we sent you delinquency notices.

143
00:08:42.022 --> 00:08:45.185
- I thought that those were just warnings.
- They were warnings.

144
00:08:45.275 --> 00:08:48.142
Well, no one warned me.
So what happens now?

145
00:08:48.236 --> 00:08:50.193
I just pretty much make my payments
out to somebody else?

146
00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.863
It means you have 30 days to pay off
the balance of your mortgage...

147
00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:55.031
or you lose your gym.

148
00:08:55.118 --> 00:08:57.655
Perfect. What's the damage?
What do I owe you?

149
00:08:57.746 --> 00:08:59.487
Fifty thousand dollars.

150
00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:04.791
Personal check gonna be okay? Might
have to wait till the end of the month...

151
00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:08.212
to go ahead and cash her, because I do
have to switch some funds around.

152
00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:10.710
Unfortunately, the charity I like
to work with is gonna take a hit.

153
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.543
Mr. La Fleur, I can assure you
this is a very serious situation.

154
00:09:14.637 --> 00:09:18.221
Yeah. No, I-- This is extremely serious,
Mrs., uh, Veatch.

155
00:09:18.308 --> 00:09:21.346
It's Ms. I'm gonna need to review
all of your financial statements...

156
00:09:21.436 --> 00:09:24.895
- and assess any tax liabilities there may be.
- <i>Absolutely</i>

157
00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:26.722
I don't know how you say Ms. for a Mr.,
'cause it's just Mr....

158
00:09:26.816 --> 00:09:29.399
but if there was a Ms. Mr.,
I'm a-- I'm a Ms. as well.

159
00:09:29.486 --> 00:09:32.353
You do keep financial records,
don't you?

160
00:09:32.447 --> 00:09:34.984
- Invoices, revenue reports, taxable income?
- <i>You kidding me?</i>

161
00:09:35.075 --> 00:09:36.736
- I got a whole closet full.
— <i>Here?</i>

162
00:09:36.826 --> 00:09:38.942
Yeah. I call 'em keepers.

163
00:09:42.624 --> 00:09:44.661
<i>Problem is that
I've never really filed them.</i>

164
00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:46.492
No kidding.

165
00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:49.999
Just out of curiosity, who would
wanna buy this place anyway?

166
00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:52.752
Come on. Come on. Squeeze it. Squeeze it.

167
00:09:52.842 --> 00:09:57.086
Squeeze it. Yeah. Come on. Come on.
Get it up. Get it up, get it up, get it up.

168
00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.217
Come on. One more, bitch!
One more, bitch!

169
00:09:59.307 --> 00:10:02.265
Yeah, bitch! Yeah!

170
00:10:02.352 --> 00:10:04.889
- Yeah!
— Now you're my bitch!

171
00:10:04.979 --> 00:10:07.095
Yeah!

172
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:09.602
Whoo!
Yeah, baby!

173
00:10:09.692 --> 00:10:15.233
Involuntary spasm. Look at--
Look at the show! Enjoy the show!

174
00:10:15.323 --> 00:10:18.611
- <i>Whoo!</i>
- Is this a bad time? I could always come back.

175
00:10:18.701 --> 00:10:20.942
<i>Looks like some real
dude sweat going on.</i>

176
00:10:21.037 --> 00:10:23.369
Add three pounds to the scales in the women's
locker room before you go home.

177
00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:26.198
- Yes, sir.
- Refreshment?

178
00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:30.035
I've got protein paste,
carb laxative.

179
00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:32.121
Oh!
Suffocated kumquat, perhaps?

180
00:10:32.215 --> 00:10:34.502
No, thank you. I'm actually
trying to cut down on those.

181
00:10:34.592 --> 00:10:38.256
- They're good. They are good.
- I know what you mean. Walk with me.

182
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.968
- Hey, Briana. Cellulite seminar tomorrow, 0600.
- Sounds great.

183
00:10:46.062 --> 00:10:50.351
Nice job, Suzie.
You call that a sit-up?

184
00:10:50.441 --> 00:10:52.773
Don't slack, Trevor.
I'm watching you.

185
00:10:52.861 --> 00:10:54.852
There's a good energy
in the gym.

186
00:10:54.946 --> 00:10:56.937
<i>Let me guess
why you're here, Pete.</i>

187
00:10:57.031 --> 00:10:59.819
You're here because I bought
out the second mortgage on your gym...

188
00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:02.651
and you've got 30 days
to make $50,000...

189
00:11:02.745 --> 00:11:04.861
or your gym
becomes my gym.

190
00:11:04.956 --> 00:11:07.197
Look, White, I know that
we've had our differences in the past--

191
00:11:07.292 --> 00:11:11.126
Differences? Is that what you call
sleeping with three of my female trainers?

192
00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:13.453
- It was one night.
- Or how about that strip-o-gram you sent me...

193
00:11:13.548 --> 00:11:15.755
for the Globo Gym
one-year anniversary?

194
00:11:15.842 --> 00:11:19.210
- The stripper was meant to be congratulatory.
- It was also a man.

195
00:11:19.304 --> 00:11:21.466
Let's not get hung up
on details here, okay?

196
00:11:21.556 --> 00:11:24.218
- Look, we're both professionals.
- Oh, really? Professionals?

197
00:11:24.309 --> 00:11:27.392
Last I heard, my gym makes money.
Yours doesn't.

198
00:11:27.478 --> 00:11:31.312
My gym's worth over four million dollars.
Your gym isn't worth four.

199
00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:35.768
I have shareholders.
You haven't even got... cup holders.

200
00:11:35.862 --> 00:11:38.194
- Why would I want cup holders?
- The point is...

201
00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:41.319
Globo Gym is a beacon
of human physical perfection.

202
00:11:41.409 --> 00:11:43.491
A benchmark
in the fitness community.

203
00:11:43.578 --> 00:11:48.539
Your <i>gym</i> is a skid mark
on the underpants of society.

204
00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:53.290
You see, Peter, I wasn't born
expecting the world to do me any favors.

205
00:11:53.379 --> 00:11:56.497
I earned this body
and I built this temple...

206
00:11:56.591 --> 00:12:00.380
<i>out of nothing more than a little
“can do” attitude and some elbow grease.</i>

207
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:03.212
And, yes, a large inheritance
from my father, Earl Goodman.

208
00:12:03.306 --> 00:12:05.593
So if I choose
to level Average Joe's...

209
00:12:05.683 --> 00:12:09.426
to build a new auxiliary parking structure
for my members, so be it.

210
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:12.012
There's nothing
you can do about it.

211
00:12:12.106 --> 00:12:14.598
In 30 days, I'll be bulldozing
that shit heap you call a gym...

212
00:12:14.692 --> 00:12:16.933
into permanent nothingness.

213
00:12:17.028 --> 00:12:20.566
And I can only hope that
you and the mongrel race...

214
00:12:20.657 --> 00:12:23.820
that comprise your membership
are inside it when I do.

215
00:12:25.203 --> 00:12:28.070
Show Mr. La Fleur out.

216
00:12:28.164 --> 00:12:30.405
Turn it up high, Reggie.

217
00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:34.618
I wanna burn!

218
00:12:34.712 --> 00:12:36.703
So that's the deal.

219
00:12:36.798 --> 00:12:40.462
We got 30 days to raise $50,000,
or Average Joe's is history.

220
00:12:40.551 --> 00:12:43.043
Now, I got 10 minutes.
I'll open it up to some "Q" and "A."

221
00:12:43.137 --> 00:12:46.596
<i>You don't have to raise your hands.
It's more of an open forum.</i>

222
00:12:46.683 --> 00:12:49.516
- But, yeah, okay, Owen. Kick us off.
- Uh, yes, Peter.

223
00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:52.344
And I'm just spitballin' here...

224
00:12:52.438 --> 00:12:56.056
but why don't we pay it off in Canadian
dollars and save ourselves some money?

225
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:58.016
<i>All right, just so you know...</i>

226
00:12:58.111 --> 00:13:00.227
if that's a route that you're interested
in traveling...

227
00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:04.565
it's $50,000 American, it would be 70,000
roughly Canadian dollars.

228
00:13:04.659 --> 00:13:07.276
How are we gonna
come up with $120,000?

229
00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:09.611
<i>Owen, no, no.
You don't add 'em together.</i>

230
00:13:09.706 --> 00:13:14.041
And technically, Peter, I'm sorry
to say this, but it's more like $73,313.

231
00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:17.085
Look, it doesn't matter.
We can't come up with $50,000.

232
00:13:17.171 --> 00:13:19.754
- <i>We're screwed.</i>
- Gar!

233
00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:21.832
It seems to me an insurmountable
amount of money.

234
00:13:21.926 --> 00:13:25.260
No, it's not insurmountable.
Come on. Come on.

235
00:13:25.346 --> 00:13:28.259
We can't just sit back and
let Globo Gym take us over.

236
00:13:28.349 --> 00:13:31.512
Average Joe's
is too important.

237
00:13:31.602 --> 00:13:33.809
Gordon, where do you go
when your wife changes the locks?

238
00:13:33.896 --> 00:13:36.388
- Average Joe's.
- Right.

239
00:13:36.482 --> 00:13:38.814
Dwight, Owen, what are you guys
gonna do if Joe's goes under?

240
00:13:38.901 --> 00:13:41.518
- Work at the airport again?
- I ain't workin' no airport again.

241
00:13:41.612 --> 00:13:44.855
<i>No, 'cause you hated it.</i>

242
00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:48.112
And, Steve, where do you go to do
whatever is it that you do?

243
00:13:48.202 --> 00:13:51.365
<i>Gar. Joe's be
the only place for Steve.</i>

244
00:13:51.456 --> 00:13:54.539
Gar! You're right!
Do you see?

245
00:13:54.625 --> 00:13:57.868
And I'll tell you, there's no way I can go
back to working out at my high school.

246
00:13:57.962 --> 00:14:00.044
It's just they'd laugh at me there,
lock me in lockers...

247
00:14:00.131 --> 00:14:02.122
make me eat clay.

248
00:14:02.216 --> 00:14:04.708
But not here.
Not at Joe's.

249
00:14:04.802 --> 00:14:07.920
<i>I need this place.
You guys need this place.</i>

250
00:14:08.014 --> 00:14:10.972
Come on!

251
00:14:11.059 --> 00:14:14.973
I got it! I know how
we can raise the money.

252
00:14:15.063 --> 00:14:17.646
- How?
- Car wash!

253
00:14:17.732 --> 00:14:19.518
Ha-ha-ha!

254
00:14:19.609 --> 00:14:22.192
<i>♪ My milk shake brings all the boys to the yard ♪</i>

255
00:14:22.278 --> 00:14:24.360
<i>♪ And they're like
it's better than yours ♪</i>

256
00:14:24.447 --> 00:14:26.358
<i>♪ Damn right
It's better than yours ♪</i>

257
00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:28.565
<i>♪ I could teach you
But I have to charge ♪</i>

258
00:14:28.659 --> 00:14:30.616
<i>♪ My milk shake brings
all the boys to the yard ♪♪</i>

259
00:14:33.664 --> 00:14:37.749
I mean, what are the chances?
Same day, right across the street?

260
00:14:37.835 --> 00:14:39.746
Come on. The girls
beat us fair and square.

261
00:14:39.837 --> 00:14:43.046
Now, I for one am gonna be
a gentleman about it and go over there...

262
00:14:43.132 --> 00:14:45.248
and congratulate each
and every one of them personally.

263
00:14:45.343 --> 00:14:47.050
- Hi, purple.
- Uh, guys?

264
00:14:47.136 --> 00:14:49.798
Guys? Uh, not to be
a naysayer or anything...

265
00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:53.678
but the only customer we've had is that weird
guy who keeps paying Justin to wash his truck.

266
00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:01.352
That's it, boy.

267
00:15:01.442 --> 00:15:05.106
Get in there nice and deep-like.

268
00:15:05.196 --> 00:15:08.734
Yeah, that's not good.

269
00:15:08.825 --> 00:15:10.486
Gar, this sucks!

270
00:15:22.171 --> 00:15:25.709
Relax, Justin.
It's just a cutout.

271
00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:29.168
At Globo Gym we're better than you,
and we know it.

272
00:15:29.262 --> 00:15:32.220
Sign up now.

273
00:15:32.306 --> 00:15:34.547
Do you smell that fitness?
I do.

274
00:15:34.642 --> 00:15:37.100
<i>Rock it and shock it, baby.</i>

275
00:15:37.186 --> 00:15:40.099
- You gotta burn it to earn it!
- What's in the envelope?

276
00:15:40.189 --> 00:15:43.272
Free 30-day trial memberships
to Globo Gym.

277
00:15:43.359 --> 00:15:47.193
- Cool.
- It's a joke, Owen. He sent it to us as an insult.

278
00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:51.274
Maybe we could sell 'em for cash,
'cause the car wash actually cost us money.

279
00:15:51.367 --> 00:15:54.280
- So we're further away from saving this place?
- Afraid so.

280
00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:56.657
- We're never gonna raise enough money.
- <i>This blows.</i>

281
00:15:56.747 --> 00:15:58.954
Guys, I know
this is tough to take...

282
00:15:59.041 --> 00:16:03.376
but if an impromptu car wash doesn't raise us
the $50,000 we need to save this place...

283
00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:05.079
then I guess
it just isn't in the cards.

284
00:16:05.173 --> 00:16:06.789
<i>Trust me here.</i>

285
00:16:06.883 --> 00:16:08.920
If there was any way,
any way in the world...

286
00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:13.425
we could've raised $50,000 in 30 days
short of robbing a bank, I'd do it.

287
00:16:13.514 --> 00:16:15.471
We could sell blood and semen.

288
00:16:15.558 --> 00:16:18.300
- Gar!
- What? Not mixed together.

289
00:16:18.394 --> 00:16:22.228
Look, guys, I love the enthusiasm.
I love the energy here.

290
00:16:22.315 --> 00:16:24.181
But we're looking at
this thing here the wrong way.

291
00:16:24.275 --> 00:16:27.358
Let's start to celebrate
the good times that was Joe's.

292
00:16:27.445 --> 00:16:30.403
We gotta start looking at this
Irish-wake style.

293
00:16:33.242 --> 00:16:37.486
<i>Let me be the first to say good-bye
to Average Joe's.</i>

294
00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:41.574
We gave it a hell of a run, guys.
Now, let's try to have some fun.

295
00:16:41.667 --> 00:16:44.659
I'm gonna go put on “The Thong Song,”
and we'll tear this place apart.

296
00:16:44.754 --> 00:16:48.122
Wait! Wait!
Peter! Peter!

297
00:16:48.216 --> 00:16:50.457
We could play dodgeball.

298
00:16:50.551 --> 00:16:53.168
That's very nice, Gordon,
but I just think everyone's tired.

299
00:16:53.262 --> 00:16:55.219
I really don't think
playing a game's gonna help.

300
00:16:55.306 --> 00:16:57.468
No, no, we--
we could play dodgeball.

301
00:16:57.558 --> 00:17:01.096
There's a tournament in Las Vegas.
I feel so dumb I didn't think about it before.

302
00:17:01.187 --> 00:17:03.645
<i>I read about the Las Vegas
International Dodgeball Open...</i>

303
00:17:03.731 --> 00:17:06.439
every single year
in <i>Obscure Sports Quarterly.</i>

304
00:17:06.526 --> 00:17:09.018
Of course. I mean, that's a very-very
common, totally common thing.

305
00:17:09.111 --> 00:17:13.480
<i>And the best part, it's open to any team
that wins a regional qualifying match.</i>

306
00:17:13.574 --> 00:17:17.568
How the hell is dodgeball gonna get us
the $50,000 we need to save this place?

307
00:17:17.662 --> 00:17:19.869
- 'Cause they have a cash prize
for the first-place winner.
- How much?

308
00:17:19.956 --> 00:17:22.448
$50,000!

309
00:17:22.542 --> 00:17:25.660
<i>Guys, we are not gonna get
$50,000 for playing dodgeball.</i>

310
00:17:25.753 --> 00:17:28.962
- Why not?
- First of all, none of us even
know how to play dodgeball.

311
00:17:29.048 --> 00:17:31.540
I do. Yeah, we played it
in P.E. last year.

312
00:17:31.634 --> 00:17:33.625
They showed us this film
about it and everything.

313
00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:37.053
- Can you get your hands on that film?
- Sure, I guess.

314
00:17:37.139 --> 00:17:39.801
<i>Guys, can we please try to be
serious here for just one second?</i>

315
00:17:39.892 --> 00:17:42.179
You said anything we could do
to raise the money, right?

316
00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:45.228
Well, this is that anything.
This is it right here!

317
00:17:45.314 --> 00:17:48.682
Come on, guys. Show of hands.
Who wants to play dodgeball?

318
00:17:48.776 --> 00:17:51.814
Come on!

319
00:17:54.031 --> 00:17:57.865
Come on, Pete.

320
00:17:57.952 --> 00:18:01.161
You guys had me
at blood and semen. Come here.

321
00:18:04.792 --> 00:18:07.955
You want it, don't you,
fat boy?

322
00:18:08.045 --> 00:18:12.835
You want that doughnut.
Go ahead and have a bite.

323
00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:16.839
Just a little bite.
One little bite won't hurt you.

324
00:18:22.059 --> 00:18:24.596
<i>Oh, mama!</i>

325
00:18:24.687 --> 00:18:26.678
Sir, Katherine Veatch
is here to see you.

326
00:18:26.772 --> 00:18:29.764
Give me 30 seconds, then send her in.

327
00:18:29.859 --> 00:18:31.349
Yes, sir.

328
00:18:47.251 --> 00:18:48.867
Thank you.

329
00:18:54.091 --> 00:18:56.128
Oh. Hello, Katherine.

330
00:18:56.218 --> 00:18:58.380
Good to see you.
I didn't know you were dropping by.

331
00:18:58.471 --> 00:19:00.382
You asked me to come over.

332
00:19:00.473 --> 00:19:03.135
Did I?

333
00:19:03.225 --> 00:19:06.058
<i>Are you reading the dictionary?</i>

334
00:19:07.855 --> 00:19:09.812
You caught me.
I like to break a mental sweat too.

335
00:19:09.899 --> 00:19:14.484
<i>Grab a chair. So, I trust
everything's going swimmingly...</i>

336
00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:17.688
<i>with our acquisition
of Average Joe's?</i>

337
00:19:17.782 --> 00:19:21.366
So far, yeah.
I mean, there's a lot...

338
00:19:21.452 --> 00:19:23.489
to do over there,
so I should probably get back.

339
00:19:23.579 --> 00:19:25.616
<i>That is a really
interesting painting.</i>

340
00:19:25.706 --> 00:19:30.542
Oh. Thank you. Yeah, that's, uh--
that's me taking the bull by the horns.

341
00:19:30.628 --> 00:19:34.371
<i>That's how I handle my business.
It's a metaphor.</i>

342
00:19:34.465 --> 00:19:37.583
- I get it.
- But that actually happened, though.

343
00:19:37.677 --> 00:19:41.671
<i>Anyway, we're a pretty
tight-knit tribe here...</i>

344
00:19:41.764 --> 00:19:44.677
but there's always room
for one more squaw.

345
00:19:44.767 --> 00:19:48.101
So please, whatever you do,
don't think of me as your <i>boss.</i>

346
00:19:48.187 --> 00:19:50.849
- Oh, I don't.
- I just don't wanna get into a formal thing here.

347
00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:54.899
I'm White, you know?
I'm White. W-H-I-T...

348
00:19:56.237 --> 00:19:58.353
E.

349
00:19:58.447 --> 00:20:01.360
<i>Thanks, Mr. Goodman,
but I'm contracted by the bank.</i>

350
00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:03.361
I mean, they just assigned me
to your account, that's all.

351
00:20:03.452 --> 00:20:06.410
Right. Well, you work for the bank,
bank works for me...

352
00:20:06.497 --> 00:20:09.455
so, ipso facto, I'm your boss.

353
00:20:09.542 --> 00:20:12.534
<i>Point is,
I would love to see...</i>

354
00:20:12.628 --> 00:20:15.211
that pretty little bone structure
of yours around here some more.

355
00:20:15.297 --> 00:20:18.164
I mean, there's no reason
we need to be shackled...

356
00:20:18.259 --> 00:20:22.423
by the strictures of the employee-employer
relationship.

357
00:20:22.513 --> 00:20:24.550
Unless, of course,
you're into that sort of thing.

358
00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.927
<i>In which case,
I got some shackles in the back.</i>

359
00:20:27.017 --> 00:20:31.727
I'm just kidding. But seriously, I've got 'em.

360
00:20:31.814 --> 00:20:35.682
I'm just doing my job,
Mr. Goodman. In fact...

361
00:20:35.776 --> 00:20:38.063
I actually...

362
00:20:38.154 --> 00:20:41.021
- prefer it over there.
- <i>Really?</i>

363
00:20:41.115 --> 00:20:43.948
You like it with those freaks
over there in Loser Town, huh?

364
00:20:44.034 --> 00:20:47.243
Freaks? They're not freaks.
They're people, just like you and me.

365
00:20:47.329 --> 00:20:50.071
People!

366
00:20:50.166 --> 00:20:52.533
People just like you and me.

367
00:20:52.626 --> 00:20:57.416
<i>Oh, man. That is what I love about you,
Kate. You've got a personality.</i>

368
00:20:57.506 --> 00:20:59.747
Ah! That is rich.

369
00:20:59.842 --> 00:21:02.960
A real sauciness that I find...

370
00:21:03.053 --> 00:21:06.341
extremely attractive.

371
00:21:07.683 --> 00:21:10.641
- We should mate.
- What?

372
00:21:10.728 --> 00:21:13.971
Date. I said we should date sometime.
You know, socially.

373
00:21:14.064 --> 00:21:16.852
Go out and kick it.

374
00:21:16.942 --> 00:21:19.274
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

375
00:21:19.361 --> 00:21:22.319
I just, uh, threw up
in my mouth a little bit.

376
00:21:22.406 --> 00:21:26.900
Yeah, you know, in some cultures,
they only eat vomit.

377
00:21:26.994 --> 00:21:30.783
I never been there,
but I read about it in a book.

378
00:21:30.873 --> 00:21:34.582
I'm sorry, Mr. Goodman.
I don't date clients.

379
00:21:36.337 --> 00:21:41.753
I get it. Don't crap where you eat.
I understand.

380
00:21:41.842 --> 00:21:46.552
Me'Shell! Please escort
Miss Veatch out.

381
00:21:46.639 --> 00:21:49.176
Oh, and Katherine.

382
00:21:49.266 --> 00:21:51.633
Make sure my acquisition
of that gym goes smoothly.

383
00:21:51.727 --> 00:21:54.890
They're up to something
over there. I can smell it.

384
00:22:01.737 --> 00:22:01.896
Über-American Instructional Films...

385
00:22:01.904 --> 00:22:04.362
Über-American Instructional Films...

386
00:22:04.448 --> 00:22:08.191
teaching America's youth
since 1938.

387
00:22:14.792 --> 00:22:16.874
<i>Hey, there, Timmy!</i>

388
00:22:16.961 --> 00:22:21.000
Holy mackerel, mister.
You scared the jeepers out of me.

389
00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:24.503
<i>How would you like to take a break
from that fine lead-based paint...</i>

390
00:22:24.593 --> 00:22:27.961
- <i>and learn about dodgeball?</i>
- Boy, would I!

391
00:22:30.307 --> 00:22:33.299
Wow! Where am I, mister?

392
00:22:33.394 --> 00:22:35.385
<i>You're in a Chinese opium den, Timmy.</i>

393
00:22:35.479 --> 00:22:38.847
<i>This is where the sport of dodgeball
was invented in the 15th century...</i>

394
00:22:38.941 --> 00:22:41.273
<i>by opium-addicted Chinamen.</i>

395
00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:45.570
<i>But back then, the Chinamen threw
severed human heads at each other...</i>

396
00:22:45.656 --> 00:22:48.273
<i>instead of the A.D.A.A.-approved
balls we use today.</i>

397
00:22:50.661 --> 00:22:52.402
A.D.A.A.?

398
00:22:52.496 --> 00:22:55.830
<i>That's the American Dodgeball
Association of America.</i>

399
00:22:55.916 --> 00:22:59.034
<i>Dodgeball is played with
six players on each team...</i>

400
00:22:59.128 --> 00:23:01.460
<i>and six rubber balls.</i>

401
00:23:01.547 --> 00:23:05.040
<i>The object of the game is to eliminate
the opposing players.</i>

402
00:23:05.134 --> 00:23:07.671
<i>Once all the players
on one team are eliminated...</i>

403
00:23:07.761 --> 00:23:10.344
- <i>the opposing team wins!</i>
- <i>Wow!</i>

404
00:23:10.431 --> 00:23:13.674
I can't wait to get
the fellas together and play!

405
00:23:13.767 --> 00:23:18.386
<i>Whoa, whoa!
Hang on a second there, sport.</i>

406
00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:21.598
- Patches O'Houlihan?
<i>- That's right, Timmy.</i>

407
00:23:21.692 --> 00:23:25.276
<i>Patches O'Houlihan,
the seven-time A.D.A.A. all-star...</i>

408
00:23:25.362 --> 00:23:27.854
<i>is here to take you
the rest of the way.</i>

409
00:23:27.948 --> 00:23:31.441
- Jeepers! Really?
- You betcha, champ.

410
00:23:31.535 --> 00:23:36.780
If you catch a ball that's thrown at you
before it hits the ground...

411
00:23:36.874 --> 00:23:39.457
<i>then the player who threw that ball
is out, not you.</i>

412
00:23:39.543 --> 00:23:45.164
Plus, another player from your team gets
to come back into the game!

413
00:23:45.257 --> 00:23:48.295
- It's a two-player swing.
- Gee, thanks, Patches.

414
00:23:48.385 --> 00:23:50.968
I can't wait to start
my own team at school.

415
00:23:51.055 --> 00:23:54.218
That-a-boy, tiger.
But remember...

416
00:23:54.308 --> 00:23:58.927
dodgeball is a sport of violence,
exclusion and degradation.

417
00:23:59.021 --> 00:24:02.139
So, when you're picking players
in gym class...

418
00:24:02.232 --> 00:24:06.396
<i>remember to pick the bigger,
stronger kids for your team.</i>

419
00:24:06.487 --> 00:24:10.401
That way, you can all gang up
on the weaker ones...

420
00:24:10.491 --> 00:24:12.858
like Winston here.

421
00:24:17.122 --> 00:24:20.035
Nice one, son.
You'll be an all-star yet.

422
00:24:20.125 --> 00:24:23.959
Just remember
the five “D”s of dodgeball:

423
00:24:24.046 --> 00:24:28.290
dodge, duck, dip,
dive and... dodge.

424
00:24:28.384 --> 00:24:31.422
Till next time, this is
Patches O'Houlihan...

425
00:24:31.512 --> 00:24:33.799
saying take care of your balls...

426
00:24:33.889 --> 00:24:36.347
and they'll take care of you.

427
00:24:37.559 --> 00:24:39.596
Okay, guys, any questions?

428
00:24:39.687 --> 00:24:42.770
<i>Great. And, uh,
just for your information...</i>

429
00:24:42.856 --> 00:24:45.689
I signed us up for the sub-regional qualifier
tomorrow at the Waldorf Rec Center.

430
00:24:45.776 --> 00:24:47.733
But we haven't even
practiced yet.

431
00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:51.609
We have to qualify for the Vegas Open,
and tomorrow's regional's our last chance.

432
00:24:51.699 --> 00:24:53.690
All right, everyone, just relax.
I've always found...

433
00:24:53.784 --> 00:24:57.197
the best way to learn a sport
is by playing it anyway.

434
00:24:57.287 --> 00:25:00.655
Anyone needs me, I'll be
in my office doing Mad Libs.

435
00:25:00.749 --> 00:25:04.413
Okay, thanks, Peter. Appreciate that a lot.
Okay, I think everybody knows--

436
00:25:07.923 --> 00:25:10.381
Don't you have
an office of your own?

437
00:25:10.467 --> 00:25:12.504
Yes, I do have
an office of my own.

438
00:25:12.594 --> 00:25:14.961
I have a very nice office with
a view and air conditioning.

439
00:25:15.055 --> 00:25:18.389
- Rub it in.
- What I don't have in my office is a closet...

440
00:25:18.475 --> 00:25:21.183
<i>overflowing with 30 years
of financial transactions...</i>

441
00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:23.432
devoid of any discernable
filing system known to man.

442
00:25:23.522 --> 00:25:27.481
Hard to believe I only got a semester
of junior college under my belt.

443
00:25:27.568 --> 00:25:33.109
For instance, do you realize you haven't
collected any membership fees in 13 months?

444
00:25:33.198 --> 00:25:36.657
I'm curious. Is it strictly apathy,
or do you really not have a goal in life?

445
00:25:36.744 --> 00:25:40.487
I found that if you have a goal
that you might not reach it.

446
00:25:40.581 --> 00:25:44.324
<i>But if you don't have one,
then you are never disappointed.</i>

447
00:25:44.418 --> 00:25:48.833
And I gotta tell ya,
it feels phenomenal.

448
00:25:48.922 --> 00:25:53.007
- Well, I guess that makes sense in a really sad way.
- <i>Sad?</i>

449
00:25:53.093 --> 00:25:55.050
You wanna know what's sad?

450
00:25:55.137 --> 00:25:57.970
Six grown men playing dodgeball.

451
00:25:58.057 --> 00:26:00.890
<i>Okay, since I'm here, I'm gonna go ahead
and probably do some abs.</i>

452
00:26:00.976 --> 00:26:03.684
Gonna shock it up.
Gonna let it go.

453
00:26:03.771 --> 00:26:06.388
<i>You know, I like to work out
all the time for this kind of sporting event.</i>

454
00:26:06.482 --> 00:26:09.440
<i>I gotta stretch it out. Gotta be limber
and loose. That's the only way to play.</i>

455
00:26:09.526 --> 00:26:13.986
<i>- Hey, you guys take vitamins?
- I take vitamins all the time.</i>

456
00:26:15.324 --> 00:26:18.817
Hmm. Dodgeball, eh?

457
00:26:18.911 --> 00:26:23.951
Well, if Peter La Fleur thinks a few
red rubber balls can save his sorry gym...

458
00:26:24.041 --> 00:26:26.999
well, he's in
for quite a surprise.

459
00:26:35.177 --> 00:26:38.135
- Sorry I'm late, guys.
- Hey, Pete.

460
00:26:38.222 --> 00:26:41.840
- Bad morning, boss?
- They usually follow good nights, Dwight.

461
00:26:41.934 --> 00:26:44.096
Hey, Gordon, your family's here.

462
00:26:44.186 --> 00:26:47.144
- Where?
- Right over there.
- <i>Great!</i>

463
00:26:47.231 --> 00:26:49.222
<i>She knows I don't like it
when she watches me.</i>

464
00:26:49.316 --> 00:26:51.478
- I get all nervous.
- The kids take after you, Gord.

465
00:26:51.568 --> 00:26:53.605
Yeah. Well, she's their stepmother.

466
00:26:53.695 --> 00:26:56.778
<i>I remarried three years ago. You know,
one of those Internet mail-order things.</i>

467
00:26:56.865 --> 00:26:59.778
- How's that working out for you?
- Really great.

468
00:26:59.868 --> 00:27:02.576
- Good.
- Really great. Hey, honey.

469
00:27:04.331 --> 00:27:07.449
“L” for love. Good times.

470
00:27:07.543 --> 00:27:09.500
“L” for love?
That doesn't mean love, Gordon.

471
00:27:09.586 --> 00:27:12.419
No, it's-- People have different
translations for different things.

472
00:27:12.506 --> 00:27:16.750
That's a special bond you have with
your mail-order wife. I think that's nice. It's fine.

473
00:27:16.844 --> 00:27:19.836
- How many teams are in this qualifier?
- Uh, two.

474
00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:21.967
All we have to is beat this team
and we're in the Vegas Open, right?

475
00:27:22.057 --> 00:27:24.640
- Yeah, yeah.
- That seems pretty simple.
- Who's the other team?

476
00:27:24.726 --> 00:27:26.683
Uh, I have it right here.
just a sec.

477
00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:30.013
Uh... Troop 417.

478
00:27:30.107 --> 00:27:33.350
Christ. We're playing Boy Scouts.

479
00:27:33.443 --> 00:27:35.229
Not quite.

480
00:27:43.912 --> 00:27:45.448
Bollocks!

481
00:27:50.752 --> 00:27:54.962
<i>Troop 417, ready? Average Joe's, ready?</i>

482
00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:58.461
<i>Set? Dodgeball!</i>

483
00:28:10.189 --> 00:28:12.430
<i>You're out!</i>

484
00:28:15.152 --> 00:28:18.065
<i>You're out!</i>

485
00:28:26.997 --> 00:28:29.409
I'm gonna send ya to hell!

486
00:28:30.542 --> 00:28:33.159
Come on, Pete!

487
00:28:37.049 --> 00:28:40.883
- Ow!
- I'm really sorry. Are you all right?

488
00:28:40.969 --> 00:28:44.382
Why would you hit a girl? Why?

489
00:28:44.473 --> 00:28:46.510
I am so sorry. Are you okay?

490
00:28:48.936 --> 00:28:51.268
<i>Troop 417!</i>

491
00:28:51.355 --> 00:28:53.437
Face! In your face!

492
00:28:53.523 --> 00:28:55.605
You're adopted. Your parents
don't even love you.

493
00:29:00.322 --> 00:29:02.233
And now,
without further ado...

494
00:29:02.324 --> 00:29:06.318
<i>it gives me great pleasure
to award first--</i>

495
00:29:07.996 --> 00:29:12.240
Uh, I'm sorry. We--
We have a bit of a problem here.

496
00:29:12.334 --> 00:29:16.419
Unfortunately for Troop 417...

497
00:29:16.505 --> 00:29:20.373
during the A.D.A.A.
required random drug screening...

498
00:29:20.467 --> 00:29:23.129
<i>one of your player's urine
tested positive for...</i>

499
00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:25.882
three separate types
of anabolic steroids...

500
00:29:25.973 --> 00:29:29.887
<i>and a low-grade
beaver tranquilizer.</i>

501
00:29:29.977 --> 00:29:34.596
<i>I'm afraid by rule
your team must be disqualified.</i>

502
00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:36.977
Goddamn you, Bernice!
Ooh!

503
00:29:37.067 --> 00:29:39.354
<i>By the power vested in me...</i>

504
00:29:39.444 --> 00:29:43.779
I declare the winner of this year's dodgeball
regional qualifying tournament...

505
00:29:43.865 --> 00:29:46.778
and grammar jamboree to be...

506
00:29:46.868 --> 00:29:48.654
<i>Average Joe's Gym.</i>

507
00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:53.326
God!

508
00:30:00.215 --> 00:30:03.128
<i>All I'm saying to you, Kate,
is that you can admit...</i>

509
00:30:03.218 --> 00:30:05.334
the real reason
why you showed up today.

510
00:30:05.429 --> 00:30:07.966
- <i>It's okay.</i>
- Like I said, I was in the neighborhood...

511
00:30:08.056 --> 00:30:10.673
and I just thought you guys could
probably use a cheering section.

512
00:30:10.767 --> 00:30:14.135
Kate, if you wanna join the team,
all you have to do is ask.

513
00:30:14.229 --> 00:30:17.517
Thank you, Peter.
I don't.

514
00:30:17.607 --> 00:30:19.598
Then it's obvious that you dig me.

515
00:30:19.693 --> 00:30:22.481
- <i>You're hooked on La Fleur.</i>
- Oh, God.

516
00:30:22.571 --> 00:30:24.733
<i>I've been through this
many times. I'm sorry.</i>

517
00:30:24.823 --> 00:30:27.565
You can't stay away from me.
I'm so stupid.

518
00:30:27.659 --> 00:30:30.117
All right, no, I'll admit
that in spite of yourself...

519
00:30:30.203 --> 00:30:33.821
you have brief moments
where you're not completely--

520
00:30:33.915 --> 00:30:36.873
<i>What?</i>

521
00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:40.078
- Where I'm not completely what?
<i>- Pathetic.</i>

522
00:30:41.381 --> 00:30:43.418
<i>Oh, hey, White.</i>

523
00:30:43.508 --> 00:30:45.545
I didn't think that
Nazi camp got out until 8:00.

524
00:30:45.635 --> 00:30:47.672
Did you decide
to skip arts and crafts?

525
00:30:47.763 --> 00:30:51.006
Yes, I did.
Oh, hello, Kate.

526
00:30:51.099 --> 00:30:53.887
I wasn't aware
I was paying you to socialize.

527
00:30:53.977 --> 00:30:55.684
You're not. I'm off the clock.

528
00:30:55.771 --> 00:30:58.354
Well, isn't that convenient for you...

529
00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.772
<i>and the clock?</i>

530
00:31:00.859 --> 00:31:02.896
I just thought I'd drop by
and congratulate you...

531
00:31:02.986 --> 00:31:04.977
on your victory
by disqualification today...

532
00:31:05.072 --> 00:31:07.530
<i>and introduce you to the team
that will be winning...</i>

533
00:31:07.616 --> 00:31:11.826
the Las Vegas International
Dodgeball Open-- my team.

534
00:31:11.912 --> 00:31:14.700
Allow me the pleasure
of introducing you to...

535
00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:17.703
Blade...

536
00:31:17.793 --> 00:31:23.709
Laser, Blazer.

537
00:31:23.799 --> 00:31:26.757
I believe you've met
my fitness consigliere, Me'Shell.

538
00:31:26.843 --> 00:31:29.130
- We've met.
- <i>Oh, and I almost forgot.</i>

539
00:31:29.221 --> 00:31:31.508
Our last player.

540
00:31:31.598 --> 00:31:36.638
Meet Fran
Stalinofskivitchdavitovichsky.

541
00:31:39.272 --> 00:31:41.513
Oh!

542
00:31:41.608 --> 00:31:45.021
<i>♪ Lady in red ♪</i>

543
00:31:46.613 --> 00:31:48.479
<i>In her home country
of Romanovia...</i>

544
00:31:48.573 --> 00:31:50.905
dodgeball is the national sport...

545
00:31:50.992 --> 00:31:54.701
and her nuclear power plant's team
won the championship five years running...

546
00:31:54.788 --> 00:32:00.409
<i>which makes her the deadliest woman
on Earth with a dodgeball.</i>

547
00:32:00.502 --> 00:32:02.459
Ball me, Blazer.

548
00:32:02.546 --> 00:32:06.130
Show them, Fran.

549
00:32:09.344 --> 00:32:12.427
<i>And that's just
her changeup.</i>

550
00:32:12.514 --> 00:32:14.630
<i>End of demo.</i>

551
00:32:14.724 --> 00:32:19.059
We are the Globo Gym
Purple Cobras, and we will--

552
00:32:19.146 --> 00:32:22.104
we will rock you!

553
00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:28.694
I think that guy
might really be dead.

554
00:32:30.407 --> 00:32:32.364
Wait a minute.
Wait-Wait-Wait a minute.

555
00:32:32.451 --> 00:32:34.692
How can you be entered
in the Las Vegas Open?

556
00:32:34.786 --> 00:32:37.073
You didn't even win
a regional qualifying match.

557
00:32:37.164 --> 00:32:40.498
Oh, my God! We never even won
a regional qualifying match!

558
00:32:40.584 --> 00:32:42.791
Oh, yeah, now I remember.

559
00:32:42.878 --> 00:32:46.496
The dodgeball chancellor's
an extremely personal friend of mine...

560
00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:49.833
and I helped him shed some unwanted
poundage before beach season.

561
00:32:49.926 --> 00:32:53.419
<i>So you can close your little rule book
on that one, Poindexter.</i>

562
00:32:53.513 --> 00:32:57.302
Look, White, we didn't come here to rumble.
We came here to celebrate as a team.

563
00:32:57.392 --> 00:32:59.429
So if you don't mind,
there's plenty of bar here...

564
00:32:59.519 --> 00:33:02.432
- for you and the Globo-nauts.
- Team?

565
00:33:02.522 --> 00:33:06.516
What team? Your best player
thinks he's a pirate.

566
00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:08.442
Ahoy! That's it!

567
00:33:08.528 --> 00:33:10.690
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay, first of all...

568
00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:13.863
he is way more of a pirate
than you will ever be.

569
00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:17.363
And secondly, we don't know
who our best player is yet.

570
00:33:17.454 --> 00:33:20.663
We've only had one game.
It could be any one of us at this point.

571
00:33:20.749 --> 00:33:22.786
That's great.
Go ahead, make your jokes...

572
00:33:22.876 --> 00:33:26.164
Mr. Jokey Joke-maker.

573
00:33:26.254 --> 00:33:28.291
But let me hit you
with some knowledge.

574
00:33:28.381 --> 00:33:30.793
You should quit now and save yourself
the embarrassment...

575
00:33:30.884 --> 00:33:34.297
of losing with these losers
in Las Vegas, La Fleur.

576
00:33:34.387 --> 00:33:37.596
Alliteration aside, I think I'll take
my chances in the tournament.

577
00:33:37.682 --> 00:33:39.298
Yeah, you will take
your chances.

578
00:33:39.392 --> 00:33:42.259
I know. I just said that.

579
00:33:42.354 --> 00:33:46.268
- I know you just said that.
- Okay, I'm not sure where you're going with this.

580
00:33:46.358 --> 00:33:49.066
- Well, I'm not sure where you're going with this.
- That's what I just said.

581
00:33:49.152 --> 00:33:51.985
- That's what I'm saying to you.
- All right.

582
00:33:53.114 --> 00:33:55.105
Touché.

583
00:33:57.118 --> 00:33:59.485
Me and my squad are gonna split.

584
00:33:59.579 --> 00:34:01.946
<i>But we'll see you at the tournament.
Oh, and La Fleur...</i>

585
00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:04.031
best bring your bib...

586
00:34:04.125 --> 00:34:06.537
'cause it's gonna get messy!

587
00:34:09.839 --> 00:34:12.752
<i>Are you all right? You okay?</i>

588
00:34:14.553 --> 00:34:17.136
Let's bounce. Cobras!

589
00:34:18.598 --> 00:34:21.511
Gar!

590
00:34:21.601 --> 00:34:26.641
Okay, guys, let's just get ourselves cleaned up
and head on home, all right?

591
00:34:33.029 --> 00:34:37.239
Hey, you. That was the worst
damned display of dodgeball...

592
00:34:37.325 --> 00:34:39.362
I've seen in 40 years.

593
00:34:39.452 --> 00:34:42.740
If you wanna have dodgeball victory,
you gotta grab it by its haunches...

594
00:34:42.831 --> 00:34:45.072
and you gotta
hump it into submission.

595
00:34:45.166 --> 00:34:48.409
- That's the only way.
- Okay, crazy guy.

596
00:34:48.503 --> 00:34:50.540
I'm-I'm gonna go home now.

597
00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:52.997
I ain't crazy, and I ain't a guy.

598
00:34:54.217 --> 00:34:57.255
The name's Patches O'Houlihan.

599
00:34:57.345 --> 00:35:01.680
- I'm your new coach.
<i>- Patches O'Houlihan?</i>

600
00:35:01.766 --> 00:35:04.724
- The guy from the dodgeball film?
- Yeah, he said he wants to coach us.

601
00:35:04.811 --> 00:35:07.644
- And you said yes?
- Look, I figured having the steady hand...

602
00:35:07.731 --> 00:35:10.143
of a seasoned dodgeball coach
could only benefit us, Dwight.

603
00:35:10.233 --> 00:35:13.442
All right, all right.
But he's not weird or anything, is he?

604
00:35:13.528 --> 00:35:17.362
No! No, he's totally normal.

605
00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:29.913
Ahh! I love the smell
of queef in the morning.

606
00:35:30.003 --> 00:35:32.870
I mean, you know,
normal for us.

607
00:35:32.964 --> 00:35:36.798
- Line up, ladies!
- What does he mean, line up?

608
00:35:36.885 --> 00:35:40.753
- Now!
- Aah!

609
00:35:40.847 --> 00:35:44.841
If you're gonna learn
to be true dodgeballers...

610
00:35:44.934 --> 00:35:48.643
then you've got to learn
the five “D”s of dodgeball:

611
00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:51.939
<i>dodge, duck, dip, dive and dodge.</i>

612
00:35:52.025 --> 00:35:57.896
<i>If you master the five “D”s,
no amount of balls on Earth can hit you.</i>

613
00:35:59.157 --> 00:36:02.650
- Queer bait, go ahead.
- Me, or--

614
00:36:02.744 --> 00:36:04.655
Yeah, um, shouldn't we, like...

615
00:36:04.746 --> 00:36:07.408
learn by dodging balls
that are thrown at us, or--

616
00:36:07.499 --> 00:36:10.867
That's what this sack
of wrenches is for.

617
00:36:16.007 --> 00:36:18.840
<i>If you can dodge a wrench,
you can dodge a ball.</i>

618
00:36:18.927 --> 00:36:21.009
What?

619
00:36:30.772 --> 00:36:32.604
Any other questions?

620
00:36:32.691 --> 00:36:34.898
Oh, my God!

621
00:36:34.984 --> 00:36:37.567
Yeah. Uh, Patches, are you sure...

622
00:36:37.654 --> 00:36:40.112
that this is completely necessary?

623
00:36:40.198 --> 00:36:43.190
Necessary?

624
00:36:43.284 --> 00:36:45.901
Is it necessary for me
to drink my own urine?

625
00:36:45.995 --> 00:36:48.077
- Probably not.
- <i>No!</i>

626
00:36:48.164 --> 00:36:52.158
But I do it anyway, because it's sterile
and I like the taste.

627
00:36:52.252 --> 00:36:55.916
- Okay.
- <i>And if you're going to lead this squad La Fleur...</i>

628
00:36:56.005 --> 00:36:59.339
you got to learn to do
the dance in the dark.

629
00:36:59.426 --> 00:37:02.043
Here, put that on.

630
00:37:02.137 --> 00:37:04.549
All right, ladies, buckle up!

631
00:37:04.639 --> 00:37:06.175
It's showtime!

632
00:37:08.101 --> 00:37:11.469
Dodge! Duck! Dip!
Dive!

633
00:37:11.563 --> 00:37:13.645
Duck!

634
00:37:13.732 --> 00:37:15.439
- Aah!
- Dive!

635
00:37:15.525 --> 00:37:18.313
- Aah!
- <i>Dip! Dive!</i>

636
00:37:18.403 --> 00:37:20.690
- Dive!
- Aah!

637
00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:25.490
<i>I've got three weeks to whip you suck-ass
failure junkies into shape!</i>

638
00:37:25.577 --> 00:37:29.161
Come on! I get better runs
in my shorts!

639
00:37:29.247 --> 00:37:32.080
Catch a ball,
one of their guys goes out...

640
00:37:32.167 --> 00:37:34.955
one of our guys comes back in.

641
00:37:35.044 --> 00:37:38.287
<i>That's the way you hurt 'em.
That's the way you win.</i>

642
00:37:40.759 --> 00:37:42.875
Let's go!
A little hustle here!

643
00:37:56.107 --> 00:38:00.192
<i>Come on!
Only 19 miles to go.</i>

644
00:38:00.278 --> 00:38:02.189
Ha-ha!

645
00:38:03.615 --> 00:38:06.607
- Attaboy!
- Aah!

646
00:38:06.701 --> 00:38:08.738
Next man!

647
00:38:08.828 --> 00:38:10.944
Uh, good luck to you, Gordon.
I want you to remember now...

648
00:38:11.039 --> 00:38:13.872
- that it's 90% mental.
- Okeydokey.

649
00:38:13.958 --> 00:38:17.417
<i>If you can dodge traffic, you can dodge a ball.</i>

650
00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:24.503
You got it, Gordon.

651
00:38:24.594 --> 00:38:26.926
Ooh, God!

652
00:38:27.013 --> 00:38:30.131
I'm fine!
I'm okay!

653
00:38:30.225 --> 00:38:32.466
- Okay.
- I'm fine.

654
00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:35.268
Ooh!

655
00:38:37.106 --> 00:38:40.019
- Ow, man!
- Wake up, Smithy!

656
00:38:45.323 --> 00:38:50.363
<i>Holy hell, son, you're about as useful
as a cock-flavored lollipop.</i>

657
00:38:50.453 --> 00:38:53.491
<i>Quick feet!
Fast hands!</i>

658
00:38:53.581 --> 00:38:55.538
<i>Catch it and throw!</i>

659
00:38:55.625 --> 00:38:58.913
<i>Pick up the pace!
All right!</i>

660
00:38:59.003 --> 00:39:02.086
<i>What a bunch of females!</i>

661
00:39:04.175 --> 00:39:07.588
<i>Jesus! Give me that.</i>

662
00:39:09.222 --> 00:39:12.055
You couldn't hit water
if you fell out of a boat.

663
00:39:12.141 --> 00:39:15.179
Where's your killer instinct, son?
You gotta get angry!

664
00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:18.854
You gotta get mean!
That's the only way you can play.

665
00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:22.274
Well, I guess I'm not
really an angry person.

666
00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:25.318
Aah! Ow!

667
00:39:25.405 --> 00:39:27.772
- Ooh!
- Are you angry now?

668
00:39:29.367 --> 00:39:31.324
- Breathe it out. You all right?
- <i>Come on!</i>

669
00:39:31.411 --> 00:39:34.449
- Let's get going here!
- <i>I'm okay.</i>

670
00:39:41.254 --> 00:39:43.791
Little help?

671
00:39:52.432 --> 00:39:55.800
What?
Eight years of softball.

672
00:39:55.894 --> 00:39:59.683
- Man, she gotta be a lesbian.
- She is not a lesbian.

673
00:39:59.772 --> 00:40:03.606
All I know is, that dyke can play.

674
00:40:13.995 --> 00:40:16.236
Come on. Come on!

675
00:40:16.331 --> 00:40:18.413
- Please?
- We need you.

676
00:40:18.499 --> 00:40:20.991
- You're really good.
- Yeah. Owen will be team manager if you play.

677
00:40:21.085 --> 00:40:23.668
- I will?
- Shut up.

678
00:40:23.755 --> 00:40:26.588
Look, guys, I find White Goodman
creepy just like you do.

679
00:40:26.674 --> 00:40:29.416
- All the more reason for you to join us.
<i>- Come on, Kate.</i>

680
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:31.592
Time to put your mouth
where our balls are.

681
00:40:31.679 --> 00:40:35.968
Sorry, I can't. I'm under contract.
It would be a conflict of interest.

682
00:40:36.059 --> 00:40:38.175
Suit yourself.

683
00:40:38.269 --> 00:40:40.977
<i>All right, guys, you heard Billie Jean King.</i>

684
00:40:41.064 --> 00:40:44.898
No crying in the breast milk.
We got plenty of work to do. Let's go.

685
00:40:44.984 --> 00:40:48.272
<i>Ah, man!</i>

686
00:40:48.363 --> 00:40:50.775
Now we've punched the pizza dough down...

687
00:40:50.865 --> 00:40:52.902
and it's time to sauce it up.

688
00:40:52.992 --> 00:40:54.949
Oh, boy, is my mouth watering.

689
00:40:55.036 --> 00:40:57.073
You're gonna wanna put
a big dollop of that tangy red...

690
00:40:57.163 --> 00:41:00.372
dead center on the dough, then
use the cheese to shove it to the edge.

691
00:41:00.458 --> 00:41:03.325
- <i>Oh, yeah.</i>
- Sir, I think you should take a look at-- Whoa!

692
00:41:03.419 --> 00:41:06.707
Uh-- What-- What--

693
00:41:08.216 --> 00:41:10.173
What have I said
about knocking? Hmm?

694
00:41:10.259 --> 00:41:12.671
- <i>Always knock!</i>
- Whoa! Sorry, sir.

695
00:41:12.762 --> 00:41:15.299
What is so important
that you need to...

696
00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:18.178
interrupt me during
my private reflection period?

697
00:41:18.267 --> 00:41:20.725
These.

698
00:41:24.899 --> 00:41:29.518
- They're getting better.
- Yes, I can see that, Me'Shell.

699
00:41:29.612 --> 00:41:31.819
I'm through playing games.

700
00:41:31.906 --> 00:41:34.068
It's time to end this square dance
once and for all.

701
00:41:34.158 --> 00:41:36.320
What about the girl?
She can throw.

702
00:41:36.411 --> 00:41:40.826
Well, I'll simply have to woo Kate
a bit sooner than nature intended.

703
00:41:40.915 --> 00:41:43.498
But rest assured, Me'Shell...

704
00:41:43.584 --> 00:41:49.079
there's no resistin' when White Goodman
puts on his shiny shoes.

705
00:41:53.136 --> 00:41:55.628
<i>♪ Tonto, jump on it
Jump on it ♪</i>

706
00:41:55.722 --> 00:41:57.884

707
00:42:01.561 --> 00:42:04.178
<i>♪ Apache, jump on it

708
00:42:08.776 --> 00:42:10.733
<i>Who is it?</i>

709
00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:14.188
It's White.

710
00:42:14.282 --> 00:42:17.866
- Surprise.
- White.

711
00:42:17.952 --> 00:42:22.321
Uh, what-- what are you--
what are you doing here?

712
00:42:22.415 --> 00:42:24.531
How do you, uh,
know where I live?

713
00:42:24.625 --> 00:42:26.992
It's called the Freedom
of Information Act, Kate.

714
00:42:27.086 --> 00:42:29.043
The hippies finally
got something right.

715
00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:31.246
Just kiddin', but not really.

716
00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:34.583
Hey, I got some great news.
Sit down.

717
00:42:34.677 --> 00:42:39.592
- What is it?
- You're fired.

718
00:42:39.682 --> 00:42:42.515
- I'm what?
- You're fired. I called up the bank...

719
00:42:42.602 --> 00:42:45.435
and told 'em that you were stealing and
drinking on the job, and they bought it.

720
00:42:45.521 --> 00:42:48.684
Can you believe it? They assigned some
other Johnny Pencil-pusher to my account.

721
00:42:48.775 --> 00:42:50.982
Why would you do that?

722
00:42:51.069 --> 00:42:53.652
I'm here to begin
my courtship with you, Kate.

723
00:42:53.738 --> 00:42:56.275
You fired me so I'd date you?

724
00:42:56.365 --> 00:42:58.527
Uh-huh.

725
00:42:58.618 --> 00:43:01.326
- You are a crazy little man.
- Come on, Kate.

726
00:43:01.412 --> 00:43:03.153
I know you've been hiding
some feelings for me.

727
00:43:03.247 --> 00:43:05.579
Oh. Yeah, nausea!

728
00:43:05.666 --> 00:43:08.875
If you don't get off my porch in two seconds,
you're gonna know exactly how that feels.

729
00:43:08.961 --> 00:43:13.501
Ooh-hoo! You like the freaky stuff, huh?
That's cool.

730
00:43:14.926 --> 00:43:17.884
Well, I can be naughty too.

731
00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:21.929
Real freaky naughty.
Ooh.

732
00:43:22.016 --> 00:43:25.475
- You a naughty freak?
- You need some help leaving, White?

733
00:43:25.561 --> 00:43:27.893
This doesn't concern you, La Fleur.

734
00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:30.062
Not nearly as much
as your hair does.

735
00:43:30.149 --> 00:43:34.188
That's for sure. But, uh, I believe
she asked you to leave.

736
00:43:37.198 --> 00:43:39.280
I get it.

737
00:43:39.367 --> 00:43:41.904
You caught the scent
of a lesser stag in your nostrils.

738
00:43:41.994 --> 00:43:44.577
<i>Pity.</i>

739
00:43:44.664 --> 00:43:46.575
I'll let you have your little moment,
La Fleur.

740
00:43:46.666 --> 00:43:49.283
'Cause after this tournament,
your gym...

741
00:43:49.377 --> 00:43:54.042
your life and your gal
are gonna be mine.

742
00:43:54.132 --> 00:43:56.248
All mine.

743
00:43:56.342 --> 00:43:59.084
To be continued--
Aah! Oh!

744
00:43:59.178 --> 00:44:01.840
You don't get
to touch me ever!

745
00:44:01.931 --> 00:44:04.389
Okay, Romeo,
let me help you up.

746
00:44:04.475 --> 00:44:08.059
- Get off of me! Don't you touch me!
- Whoa!

747
00:44:10.273 --> 00:44:13.231
It is over
between us, Kate.

748
00:44:13.317 --> 00:44:17.231
Nobody makes me bleed
my own blood. Nobody!

749
00:44:30.626 --> 00:44:32.663
Well, at least
that wasn't weird.

750
00:44:32.753 --> 00:44:35.916
- Yeah.
- Do I smell cookies?

751
00:44:36.007 --> 00:44:39.921
- <i>Hey!</i>
- Dear Barbara.

752
00:44:48.269 --> 00:44:50.180
I like unicorns.

753
00:44:50.271 --> 00:44:52.512
Wow.

754
00:44:52.607 --> 00:44:55.190
Look, I know you said no
to joining the team...

755
00:44:55.276 --> 00:44:58.860
but I'd like you to reconsider
as a personal favor to me.

756
00:44:58.946 --> 00:45:00.903
- Look, Peter--
- Look, before you answer...

757
00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:03.573
I think it's important for you to know
you'd have your own changing room.

758
00:45:03.659 --> 00:45:05.866
- Really?
- Sort of.

759
00:45:05.953 --> 00:45:09.366
- Mmm.
- Oh, and, uh, there's also this.

760
00:45:09.457 --> 00:45:12.415
- Oh. Okay, what's this?
- I overdid.

761
00:45:14.962 --> 00:45:17.078
Oh, look at you.

762
00:45:17.173 --> 00:45:20.382
Two expired movie passes,
and a coupon...

763
00:45:20.468 --> 00:45:23.836
for one free back rub
from Peter La Fleur.

764
00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:25.637
Play your cards right,
that could turn into a full-body.

765
00:45:25.723 --> 00:45:28.010
Okay, will you just stop,
please?

766
00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:32.389
I don't want your perk package.
I don't want your back rub.

767
00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:35.893
I just wanna see the look on White Goodman's
face when we win that tournament.

768
00:45:35.983 --> 00:45:39.601
- You're in?
- I'm in.

- Pep.
- Yeah, Cotton. Hey.

786
00:46:36.085 --> 00:46:38.452
Everybody,
32 teams in play.

787

789
00:46:45.344 --> 00:46:48.837
- Cotton!
- Well, there's an electricity in the air, folks.

790
00:46:48.931 --> 00:46:51.798
A palpable hue of anticipation.

791
00:46:51.892 --> 00:46:55.351
Immortality
five simple victories away.

00:47:29.263 --> 00:47:31.846
- Hey.
- Hey. What's in the box?

796
00:47:31.932 --> 00:47:36.517
Guys, I figured a real dodgeball team
needs real dodgeball uniforms.

797
00:47:36.604 --> 00:47:40.689
And so I threw out those old ratty ones
and designed these myself.

798
00:47:40.775 --> 00:47:44.109
All right! Now we get our thing going on.
Maybe we start smacking each other.

799
00:47:44.195 --> 00:47:47.278
I hope everything fits.

800
00:47:48.783 --> 00:47:51.571
- Wait.
- Nice.

801
00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:53.901
This isn't right.

802
00:47:54.830 --> 00:47:56.992

- What's this?

805
00:48:01.545 --> 00:48:04.537
What the hell is that?
This is screwed up!

806
00:48:04.632 --> 00:48:06.669
This is great! What are
we supposed to do now?

807
00:48:06.759 --> 00:48:09.171
Don't worry. We'll play in
what we've got on, right?

808
00:48:09.261 --> 00:48:12.970
No, we can't. A.D.A.A. rules require
we wear matching uniforms.

809
00:48:13.057 --> 00:48:15.344
Well, I don't think they require...

810
00:48:15.434 --> 00:48:19.177
- ass-less chaps, okay?
- Look, everyone, can we
calm down here for a second?

811
00:48:19.271 --> 00:48:21.933
We're gonna have plenty of time to find
other uniforms before we have to play.

812
00:48:22.024 --> 00:48:26.143
<i>Ladies, ladies, we gotta get on the court
or we're gonna forfeit the game!</i>

813
00:48:26.237 --> 00:48:30.105
<i>Come on! Let's go! Let's see
some movement! Chop-chop!</i>

814
00:48:30.199 --> 00:48:32.236
I don't see any movement!
Let's go!

820
00:48:45.881 --> 00:48:49.795
- That is some good, clean
family fun there, eh, Cot?
- Right you are.

821
00:48:49.885 --> 00:48:52.092
Here comes Germany's Team Blitzkrieg.

822
00:48:52.179 --> 00:48:55.763
<i>The reigning European champ hopes
to extend their empire here on American soil.</i>

823
00:48:55.850 --> 00:48:57.807
<i>Appeasement be damned!</i>

824
00:48:57.893 --> 00:49:01.477
<i>And here comes the relatively
unknown challengers...</i>

825
00:49:01.564 --> 00:49:06.809
a regional qualifying team,
Average Joe's Gymnasium.

826
00:49:15.369 --> 00:49:18.578
Oh, my sweet Jesus.

827
00:49:18.664 --> 00:49:20.120
That's rad.

828
00:49:20.207 --> 00:49:23.575
<i>Hey, asshole, you guys suck!</i>

829
00:49:23.669 --> 00:49:27.503
Thank you. Nice-Nice
to be in Vegas. Uh, hi.

830
00:49:27.590 --> 00:49:31.379
<i>We're all here and, um,
we are ready to play.</i>

831
00:49:34.221 --> 00:49:37.634
- Okay.
- Okay.

832
00:49:37.725 --> 00:49:41.013
<i>And we get our first glimpse
of the Average Joe's squad...</i>

833
00:49:41.103 --> 00:49:43.720
<i>sporting some unwieldy uniforms.</i>

834
00:49:43.814 --> 00:49:45.771
<i>I feel like I'm watching a Cher video, Cotton.</i>

835
00:49:45.858 --> 00:49:47.849
- Average Joe's ready?
- Gar!

836
00:49:47.943 --> 00:49:49.900
Blitzkrieg ready?

837
00:49:49.987 --> 00:49:52.069
Dodgeball!

838
00:49:52.156 --> 00:49:56.320
<i>And we're underway! Average Joe's
versus the heavily-favored German team.</i>

839
00:49:56.410 --> 00:49:58.902
<i>Of course, S&M gear
first made popular...</i>

840
00:49:58.996 --> 00:50:03.786
- <i>by the lyric poet Sappho
from the island of Lesbos.</i>
- Clean hit! You're out!

841
00:50:03.876 --> 00:50:08.336
<i>Leather and latex belong in
the bedroom, not on the dodgeball court, Cotton.</i>

842
00:50:08.422 --> 00:50:13.758
Where's that training?
Dodge, duck, dip, dive, dodge!

843
00:50:13.844 --> 00:50:16.552
<i>Oh! Captain Peter La Fleur gets eliminated...</i>

844
00:50:16.639 --> 00:50:19.506
<i>and Coach O'Houlihan
is not happy.</i>

845
00:50:25.356 --> 00:50:27.768
<i>Ooh! I'll tell you what.</i>

846
00:50:27.858 --> 00:50:30.065
<i>This Average Joe's team doesn't look up to snuff.</i>

847
00:50:30.152 --> 00:50:33.520
Mid-line infraction! You stepped
over the line! You're out!

848
00:50:33.614 --> 00:50:36.072
Dan, the Average Joe's
catches a break there.

849
00:50:36.158 --> 00:50:39.742
<i>But the Germans still dominating
this Maginot Line-like defense.</i>

850
00:50:39.828 --> 00:50:41.910
- <i>Good toss by the submissive out there.</i>
- You're out!

851
00:50:41.997 --> 00:50:46.662
<i>Just two players left for-- Oh!
Check that. Make it one.</i>

852
00:50:46.752 --> 00:50:49.619
Looks like Average Joe's
might be heading home early.

853
00:50:49.713 --> 00:50:54.924
<i>It's all up to the only player without
a “Y” chromosome-- Kate Veatch.</i>

854
00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:57.593
<i>Oh! What a throw!</i>

855
00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:01.264
- Hold your phone. She's got a cannon.
- Yes!

856
00:51:01.350 --> 00:51:05.560
- Come on! Come on, Kate!
- You're the only man out there!
Give it to 'em, baby!

857
00:51:05.688 --> 00:51:08.771
<i>The Germans have a two-one advantage.
Oh! Great catch!</i>

858
00:51:08.857 --> 00:51:10.973
<i>And Peter La Fleur's back in the game.</i>

859
00:51:11.068 --> 00:51:13.059
How about that?
It's a two-on-one switcheroo.

860
00:51:13.153 --> 00:51:15.440
<i>And now Joe's
has the upper hand.</i>

861
00:51:15.531 --> 00:51:17.693
- <i>Great deflection.</i>
- Take it to him!

862
00:51:17.783 --> 00:51:22.528
- <i>He's ball-less now!</i>
<i>- He doesn't have any balls, Cotton!</i>

863
00:51:22.621 --> 00:51:25.488
Average Joe's!

864
00:51:25.583 --> 00:51:30.828
<i>Oh, my sweet click!
It's magic! All right!</i>

865
00:51:30.921 --> 00:51:33.333
<i>Oh, my, the Germans losing in the first round.</i>

866
00:51:33.424 --> 00:51:36.712
And Average Joe's wins
in a shocking upset.

867
00:51:36.802 --> 00:51:39.419
I feel shocked.

868
00:51:39.513 --> 00:51:42.096
- Yeah!
— We won!

869
00:51:47.605 --> 00:51:50.188
Losers!

870
00:52:00.367 --> 00:52:04.406
You must be Daddy.

871
00:52:04.496 --> 00:52:08.114
<i>Average Joe's has shocked
the dodgeball pundits...</i>

872
00:52:08.208 --> 00:52:11.576
<i>and made it to tomorrow's round, where
we'll separate the wheat from the chaff...</i>

873
00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:13.536
<i>the men from the boys...</i>

874
00:52:13.631 --> 00:52:15.793
<i>and the awkwardly feminine
from the possibly Canadian.</i>

875
00:52:15.883 --> 00:52:19.547
<i>So don't go anywhere, folks.
It's just getting exciting.</i>

876
00:52:22.723 --> 00:52:24.885
What the hell?

877
00:52:24.975 --> 00:52:27.558
That guy's a dickhead.

878
00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:36.813
You wanted to see me,
Patches?

879
00:52:36.904 --> 00:52:38.986
You did good out there.
Real good.

880
00:52:39.073 --> 00:52:40.780
<i>You're a natural leader,
La Fleur.</i>

881
00:52:40.866 --> 00:52:43.528
Those men and that muff-diver
in there believe in you.

882
00:52:43.619 --> 00:52:47.078
- Kate's not a muff-diver--
- Ahh, no.

883
00:52:48.457 --> 00:52:50.573
Hey. That's for you.

884
00:52:51.835 --> 00:52:53.872
I can't accept this, Patches.

885
00:52:53.962 --> 00:52:56.249
<i>You're a hell of a player, Peter.
You earned it.</i>

886
00:52:57.716 --> 00:52:59.627
I got some hookers
in my room.

887
00:52:59.718 --> 00:53:02.585
<i>What do you say we go celebrate?
My treat.</i>

888
00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:05.923
No, thanks. I-I think I'll just stick
with the scarf here, but thank you.

889
00:53:06.016 --> 00:53:08.223
Suit yourself, queer.

890
00:53:18.195 --> 00:53:20.186
- I'm sorry.
- Justin?

891
00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:22.988
Amber. Jeez, Louise,
what are you doin' here?

892
00:53:23.075 --> 00:53:25.407
We're here for the National
Cheerleading Championships.

893
00:53:25.494 --> 00:53:27.952
Oh! Yeah, no doi, the N.C.C.'s.
That's so awesome.

894
00:53:28.038 --> 00:53:30.780
We're in the finals tomorrow.
What are you doing here?

895
00:53:30.874 --> 00:53:33.241
I'm in the dodgeball tournament.

896
00:53:33.335 --> 00:53:35.702
<i>Yeah, these are my teammates Dwight,
Ms. Veatch, and, uh--</i>

897
00:53:35.796 --> 00:53:39.460
- Gordon.
- Yeah. This is Amber, so--

898
00:53:39.550 --> 00:53:41.712
Come on, babe. I want to
ride the roller coaster.

899
00:53:41.802 --> 00:53:43.793
Uh, hey, Derek.
Sweet 'do, man.

900
00:53:43.887 --> 00:53:46.879
Get bent, helmet.
Let's go, Amber.

901
00:53:46.974 --> 00:53:49.716
- It was nice to see you. And good luck tomorrow!
- And I'll see you.

902
00:53:49.810 --> 00:53:52.393
You look... healthy.
Uh, good.

903
00:53:52.479 --> 00:53:55.141
<i>What?</i>

904
00:53:55.232 --> 00:53:57.940
Don't worry about that guy, Justin.
He's a total jerk.

905
00:53:58.026 --> 00:54:01.485
Yeah. He'll probably fall off the roller coaster
and break every bone in his body.

906
00:54:01.572 --> 00:54:04.280
- Nice, Dwight.
- I'm just sayin', it happens.

907
00:54:04.366 --> 00:54:08.280
- My cousin Ray-Ray? Boop! Dead.
- Thanks, man.

908
00:54:11.206 --> 00:54:14.619
Let's huddle up here! We got some work to do.

909
00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:17.998
<i>We got lucky
in the first round.</i>

910
00:54:18.088 --> 00:54:20.295
We caught those
dirty Krauts napping.

911
00:54:20.382 --> 00:54:23.875
<i>But that ain't gonna happen again,
so blow out the horse hockey...</i>

912
00:54:23.969 --> 00:54:27.678
blockers in the center, funneling;

913
00:54:27.765 --> 00:54:32.680
aim low; and will someone
catch a goddamn ball?

914
00:54:32.770 --> 00:54:37.480
It's like watching a bunch of retards
trying to fuck a doorknob out there.

915
00:54:37.566 --> 00:54:41.400
<i>Get it together!
Let's play some dodgeball.</i>

916
00:54:41.487 --> 00:54:45.526
- Hands in. One, two, three, Joe's!
- Joe's!

917
00:54:47.242 --> 00:54:49.483
- Average Joe's ready?
- Yes!

918
00:54:49.578 --> 00:54:51.740
Lumberjacks ready?

919
00:54:51.830 --> 00:54:54.162
- Dodgeball!
<i>- Average Joe's has their work cut out...</i>

920
00:54:54.249 --> 00:54:56.536
<i>for them, facing these
Lumberjacks in the second round.</i>

921
00:54:56.627 --> 00:55:00.211
<i>These woodsmen probably haven't even
smelled a woman in eight months. Ooh!</i>

922
00:55:00.297 --> 00:55:02.379
<i>They must masturbate a lot, Cotton.</i>

923
00:55:02.466 --> 00:55:04.377
Clean hit! You're out!

924
00:55:04.468 --> 00:55:08.086
<i>Got him in the beer gut.
And Average Joe's looking tough.</i>

925
00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:09.966
Yes!

926
00:55:10.057 --> 00:55:12.970
Yah!

927
00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:15.893
<i>Oh, now there's a souvenir
for a lucky fan.</i>

928
00:55:18.190 --> 00:55:22.275
<i>Boom! Timber!
Peter La Fleur nails him.</i>

929
00:55:22.361 --> 00:55:26.525
That's all she wrote, folks. And Average Joe's
does some clear-cutting of their own...

930
00:55:26.615 --> 00:55:28.731
<i>and moves on
to the quarter-final.</i>

931
00:55:30.452 --> 00:55:33.319
<i>Globo Gym hoping to drop
an A-bomb here on the Kamikazes.</i>

932
00:55:33.413 --> 00:55:36.075
<i>I don't know how they can
play in diapers, Cotton. I never could.</i>

933
00:55:36.166 --> 00:55:38.203
Peek-a-boo!

934
00:55:38.293 --> 00:55:42.332
<i>Oh, White Goodman, employing
his patented peek-a-boo style attack...</i>

935
00:55:42.422 --> 00:55:45.039
<i>tells Suzuki Toyota Oshinawa,
“This is my dojo.”</i>

936
00:55:45.133 --> 00:55:48.216
- <i>Ooh!</i>
- Is he gonna feel that tomorrow or what, Cotton?

937
00:55:48.303 --> 00:55:52.968
- Right in his beak!
- <i>A relentless Globo Gym attack, led by...</i>

938
00:55:53.058 --> 00:55:54.969
<i>their Lilliputian leader,
White Goodman.</i>

939
00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:58.269
<i>It's gotta be the hair,
Cotton. It's beautiful.</i>

940
00:55:58.355 --> 00:56:01.768
<i>Feathered and lethal.
You just don't see it nowadays.</i>

941
00:56:01.859 --> 00:56:07.855
<i>Whoa-ho! And Globo Gym says,</i>
“Domo arigato, <i>Mr. Roboto"...</i>

942
00:56:07.948 --> 00:56:10.030
<i>and breezes into the semi-final.</i>

943
00:56:11.952 --> 00:56:14.990
<i>Skillz That Killz, ready? Average Joe's ready?</i>

944
00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:19.324
- Dodgeball!
- <i>Average Joe is plannin' to
playa-hate Skillz That Killz...</i>

945
00:56:19.418 --> 00:56:22.536
<i>the inner-city champ
for five years straight.</i>

946
00:56:22.629 --> 00:56:26.623
<i>Skillz might be looking past Average Joe's,
doing a little more dancing than dodgeballing.</i>

947
00:56:26.717 --> 00:56:30.301
<i>They better chickity-check
themselves before they wreck themselves, Cotton.</i>

948
00:56:30.387 --> 00:56:32.378
<i>Right you are, partner. Great catch!</i>

949
00:56:32.472 --> 00:56:36.340
<i>La Fleur wheels and fires! Got him!</i>

950
00:56:36.435 --> 00:56:39.143
Winner! Average Joe's!

951
00:56:39.229 --> 00:56:41.971
<i>And Average Joe's, not blinded by the bling-bling...</i>

952
00:56:42.065 --> 00:56:44.272
<i>advances to the semi-final!</i>

953
00:56:46.945 --> 00:56:51.155
<i>Globo Gym's making mincemeat of
the Las Vegas Police Department.</i>

954
00:56:51.241 --> 00:56:54.654
Oh! That's gotta hurt.

955
00:56:54.745 --> 00:56:57.157
<i>Bu-Bu-Bu-Bull's-Eye!</i>

956
00:56:57.247 --> 00:56:59.579
<i>Winner! Globo Gym!</i>

957
00:56:59.666 --> 00:57:03.705
<i>Sportsmanship be darned! Globo Gym
hands the Las Vegas Police Department...</i>

958
00:57:03.795 --> 00:57:06.878
- <i>a “187”, and they're goin' to the finals!</i>
- Cobra, Cobra, Cobra, yes!

959
00:57:10.010 --> 00:57:14.220
<i>The Poughkeepsie State Flying Cougars
are all over Average Joe's today.</i>

960
00:57:14.306 --> 00:57:16.422
<i>It just doesn't look good for them.
The winner of this match...</i>

961
00:57:16.516 --> 00:57:20.305
<i>goes on to face Globo Gym
in the finals, and right now it's all-- Oh!</i>

962
00:57:20.395 --> 00:57:24.480
- <i>Right in the testicles.</i>
- You, bro.</i>

963
00:57:24.566 --> 00:57:28.730
- <i>Average Joe's down to their
final two players.</i>
- Come on!

964
00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:31.232
- <i>Peter La Fleur can't hold on!</i>
- Clean hit! You're out!

965
00:57:31.323 --> 00:57:34.281
- Time out! Gordy!
- Time out! Time out!

966
00:57:34.368 --> 00:57:36.826
Time! Time is out!

967
00:57:36.912 --> 00:57:39.279
<i>It looks like the clock
is about to strike midnight...</i>

968
00:57:39.373 --> 00:57:43.241
<i>on this Cinderella story, turning
Average Joe's into the proverbial pumpkin.</i>

969
00:57:43.335 --> 00:57:47.169
I sure do like pumpkins, Cotton.

970
00:57:47.255 --> 00:57:50.793
You ain't gonna be able to hit 'em.
They're too good, and you suck something awful.

971
00:57:50.884 --> 00:57:54.593
- Yes, sir. I sure do.
- Our only shot is for you to get angry!

972
00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:58.469
- Roger that. Okay.
- All right. Hands in.

973
00:57:58.558 --> 00:58:00.799
- One, two, three-- Hit 'em!
- Joe's!

974
00:58:00.894 --> 00:58:04.387
<i>You've gotta get angry! Get angry now!</i>

975
00:58:04.481 --> 00:58:07.439
<i>Gordon Pibb, alone facing five Cougars.</i>

976
00:58:07.526 --> 00:58:10.359
- Oh, boy.
- <i>It's all but the crying. Sayonara...</i>

977
00:58:10.445 --> 00:58:13.403
<i>auf Wiedersehen,
and good-bye.</i>

978
00:58:25.627 --> 00:58:29.871
- Dodgeball!
<i>- And let the dodgeball slaughter begin.</i>

979
00:58:29.965 --> 00:58:34.630
<i>Good deflection there.
Hanging on, and another one.</i>

980
00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:36.711
<i>Three balls at once!
Who knew?</i>

981
00:58:36.805 --> 00:58:40.014
<i>Now it's four on one.
Pibb is not going down without a fight!</i>

982
00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:43.513
- That's it!
- <i>You're kidding me!</i>

983
00:58:43.603 --> 00:58:45.640
<i>He's calling them out!</i>

984
00:58:45.731 --> 00:58:48.689
<i>Now it's two on one!
Who would have thunk it?</i>

985
00:58:48.775 --> 00:58:51.437
Go, you crazy son of a bitch!

986
00:58:51.528 --> 00:58:53.644
<i>He's on the warpath!</i>

987
00:58:55.824 --> 00:58:58.441
<i>Incredible! It's one on one!</i>

988
00:58:58.535 --> 00:59:02.369
- <i>I can't believe it!</i>
<i>- It's just not believable, Cotton.</i>

989
00:59:10.630 --> 00:59:11.711
- <i>Winner!</i>
<i>- Average Joe's wins!</i>

990
00:59:11.715 --> 00:59:15.253
- <i>Winner!</i>
<i>- Average Joe's wins!</i>

991
00:59:15.343 --> 00:59:19.883
<i>They are going to the finals
to play Globo Gym for $50,000!</i>

992
00:59:19.973 --> 00:59:22.715
<i>That'll buy you one heck of a blumpkin.</i>

993
00:59:22.809 --> 00:59:25.176
<i>Right you are, Pep. To be honest, folks...</i>

994
00:59:25.270 --> 00:59:29.355
<i>I never would have dreamed it possible,
but with seven-time A.D.A.A. all-star...</i>

995
00:59:29.441 --> 00:59:34.481
Patches O'Houlihan at the helm,
I guess it must be the luck of the Irish.

996
00:59:38.658 --> 00:59:42.617
Tomorrow, we're gonna pecker-slap
those Globo Gym bastards!

997
00:59:42.704 --> 00:59:44.866
- Yeah!
- You really think we can beat Globo Gym, Pete?

998
00:59:44.956 --> 00:59:47.163
As long as we got Patches,
we got a shot.

999
00:59:52.422 --> 00:59:57.212
Oh, my God.

1000
00:59:57.302 --> 01:00:00.420
Well, it's probably the way
he would have wanted to go.

1001
01:00:00.514 --> 01:00:02.551
- What?
- <i>Guys!</i>

1002
01:00:02.641 --> 01:00:04.803
What are we gonna do
without Patches?

1003
01:00:04.893 --> 01:00:07.055
We gonna get our taints
handed to us, that's what!

1004
01:00:07.145 --> 01:00:10.183
- What's a taint?
- I don't know. Sounds bad.

1005
01:00:11.691 --> 01:00:14.649
Maybe you should go
say something to the guys.

1006
01:00:14.736 --> 01:00:17.228
Yeah. They don't really make a...

1007
01:00:17.322 --> 01:00:21.941
“Sorry your dodgeball coach just got
crushed by two tons of irony” Hallmark card.

1008
01:00:24.162 --> 01:00:26.244
I'll be right back.

1009
01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:37.464
<i>¿Donde está la biblioteca,
Pedro?</i>

1010
01:00:37.551 --> 01:00:41.169
- White?
- We're opening a new Globo Gym in Mexico City.

1011
01:00:41.263 --> 01:00:46.429
I been boning up on my Spanish.

1012
01:00:46.518 --> 01:00:49.977
Me'Shell was having some digestive problems.
I hope you don't mind.

1013
01:00:50.063 --> 01:00:52.350
Will you shut that?

1014
01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:55.057
For all of us, babe.

1015
01:00:57.946 --> 01:01:01.655
So that's the deal.
I give you $100,000...

1016
01:01:01.741 --> 01:01:03.732
you sign over the deed
to your gym.

1017
01:01:03.827 --> 01:01:07.286
Period.
End o' story.

1018
01:01:07.372 --> 01:01:10.660
You really think you can come in here
and buy me out, White?

1019
01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:13.208
- You're a lot dumber than I thought.
- Hmph.

1020
01:01:13.295 --> 01:01:17.755
I don't think I'm a lot dumber than you
thought that I think that I thought I was once.

1021
01:01:19.259 --> 01:01:22.251
Look, Peter.
I know what it's like!

1022
01:01:22.345 --> 01:01:24.632
Really! I mean, for all our
blustering back and forth...

1023
01:01:24.723 --> 01:01:26.839
we're really pretty much
the same guy.

1024
01:01:26.933 --> 01:01:30.597
We're both leaders. And I like what you've
clone with the gym over there. Really!

1025
01:01:30.687 --> 01:01:35.853
I love the, “I'm not okay, you're not okay,
but that's okay” thing you got goin'.

1026
01:01:35.942 --> 01:01:39.060
“You can be fat, as long as you're happy
on the inside.” It's great! It works.

1027
01:01:39.154 --> 01:01:42.613
And they love <i>you.</i>
<i>Whoo,</i> do they love you.

1028
01:01:42.699 --> 01:01:45.987
- You're their Fonzie, Pete.
- Hey!

1029
01:01:46.077 --> 01:01:48.284
Right?

1030
01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:52.535
But do you really think it's fair for them
to put all that pressure on you?

1031
01:01:52.626 --> 01:01:54.708
<i>All</i> the time?
Hmm?

1032
01:01:54.794 --> 01:01:58.378
<i>Looking to you to solve
their every problem?</i>

1033
01:01:58.465 --> 01:02:02.880
I mean, come on.
I know you.

1034
01:02:02.969 --> 01:02:05.085
You know you.

1035
01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:07.262
And I know you know
that I know you.

1036
01:02:07.349 --> 01:02:10.717
<i>You're heading
for a fall, Pete.</i>

1037
01:02:10.810 --> 01:02:12.926
Sooner or later,
Average Joe's is gonna close.

1038
01:02:14.397 --> 01:02:16.388
And when it does...

1039
01:02:16.483 --> 01:02:18.520
they're gonna blame you.

1040
01:02:18.610 --> 01:02:22.274
I don't know if you've ever seen $100,000...

1041
01:02:22.364 --> 01:02:24.105
except maybe in the movies.

1042
01:02:24.199 --> 01:02:28.158
But I assure you,
something gets lost in the translation.

1043
01:02:30.455 --> 01:02:34.039
<i>Money. $100,000.</i>

1044
01:02:34.125 --> 01:02:37.083
Dodgeball game.

1045
01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:41.505
Take the money.
Invest it in something.

1046
01:02:41.591 --> 01:02:44.003
Give it to charity.
I don't care.

1047
01:02:51.434 --> 01:02:53.516
Just sign the contract.

1048
01:02:58.984 --> 01:03:02.022
Come on, guys.
We got Peter.

1049
01:03:02.112 --> 01:03:06.447
And they got guys named “Laser”
and “Blazer” and “Taser” and all kinds of “-asers.”

1050
01:03:06.533 --> 01:03:09.821
Gar. Steve's gotta go
drain the sea monster.

1051
01:03:09.911 --> 01:03:13.154
Here you go, guys.
Justin, your virgin daiquiri.

1052
01:03:13.248 --> 01:03:15.455
- Thanks, Ms. Veatch.
- <i>Gordon?</i>
- Nothin' for me.

1053
01:03:15.542 --> 01:03:18.705
<i>Dwight says we're gonna get killed
out there. What do you think, Peter?</i>

1054
01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:21.412
- Let's not talk about tomorrow.
- What are we gonna do, Pete?

1055
01:03:21.506 --> 01:03:23.747
I don't know, Justin.
It's a little complicated, isn't it?

1056
01:03:23.842 --> 01:03:25.958
- But what do you think we should do?
- Yeah, come on. Tell us.

1057
01:03:26.052 --> 01:03:28.339
- Come on, boss.
- What's the plan?
- Yeah.

1058
01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:31.673
What do you guys want from me here?
I don't have a plan for ya.

1059
01:03:31.766 --> 01:03:34.849
We're gonna play Globo Gym tomorrow,
and we're probably gonna lose.

1060
01:03:36.062 --> 01:03:38.520
It's the truth.

1061
01:03:38.606 --> 01:03:41.724
The sooner you guys get that through your head,
the easier this whole thing's gonna be.

1062
01:03:43.111 --> 01:03:45.694
Jesus Christ.

1063
01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:47.817
He didn't mean that.

1064
01:03:47.907 --> 01:03:49.989
- Is he being serious?
- Mm-mm.

1065
01:03:50.076 --> 01:03:52.693
<i>Oh, he's probably just stressed out.</i>

1066
01:03:52.787 --> 01:03:55.620
I've never seen him
like that.

1067
01:03:57.083 --> 01:04:01.702
Gar, matey. Where are you headed?
Peter!

1068
01:04:01.796 --> 01:04:04.458
You are not a pirate.

1069
01:04:11.931 --> 01:04:15.014
Okay, guys. Let's get out of here
and get some rest for tomorrow.

1070
01:04:23.193 --> 01:04:26.151
Hey, Dwight.
Uh--

1071
01:04:26.237 --> 01:04:29.480
I'm gonna catch up with you guys later.
I'm gonna go have a bathroom--

1072
01:04:29.574 --> 01:04:32.532
Go to the drink...
in the bathroom.

1073
01:04:32.619 --> 01:04:34.610
Whatever you do,
wash your hands.

1074
01:04:40.126 --> 01:04:44.415
<i>♪ Never seen you looking so
lovely as you did tonight ♪</i>

1075
01:04:44.506 --> 01:04:47.123
- <i>♪ I've never seen you shine so bright ♪</i>
- Excuse me, miss.

1076
01:04:47.217 --> 01:04:51.552
- I was wondering if-
- You are the one who stares at me.

1077
01:04:51.638 --> 01:04:57.133
- Why is this?
- Because I think you're the most
beautiful thing I've ever seen.

1078
01:05:04.651 --> 01:05:06.733
Watch it, freak.

1079
01:05:18.415 --> 01:05:22.079
<i>Go back to Treasure Island!</i>

1080
01:05:22.168 --> 01:05:25.160

01:06:05.879 --> 01:06:09.964
Hello, everybody, and welcome
to what you've all been waiting for:

1091
01:06:10.049 --> 01:06:13.963
a David and Goliath story
truer than the Bible itself.

1092
01:06:14.053 --> 01:06:18.047
The championship dodgeball match
here on ESPN Eight, the <i>Ocho.</i>

1093
01:06:20.518 --> 01:06:22.509
Peter?

1094
01:06:24.898 --> 01:06:27.731
Peter? Hello?

1095
01:06:29.277 --> 01:06:32.065
Peter. Come on.
Everybody headed down--

1096
01:06:42.999 --> 01:06:45.036
So, what happens
on a double fault?

1097
01:06:45.126 --> 01:06:47.959
Oh, on any double fault,
you go to sudden-death elimination.

1098
01:06:48.046 --> 01:06:50.458
It's continuation rule
113-D.

1099
01:06:50.548 --> 01:06:53.210
- Whatever.
- Hey, guys, wait up!

1100
01:06:56.888 --> 01:07:00.722
Justin! Oh, I've been
looking for you everywhere.

1101
01:07:00.808 --> 01:07:02.890
Really? I mean why?
What's up?

1102
01:07:02.977 --> 01:07:06.015
Derek fell off the roller coaster
and broke every bone in his body.

1103
01:07:06.105 --> 01:07:08.688
- He can't compete!
- Oh, my God. That's awful.

1104
01:07:08.775 --> 01:07:12.359
He was the center Kewpie with me. Without
the center Kewpie, we can't do our routine.

1105
01:07:12.445 --> 01:07:15.483
- Oh, no. I'm sorry.
- You gotta do it.

1106
01:07:15.573 --> 01:07:17.905
What?
N-N-N-N-No.

1107
01:07:17.992 --> 01:07:22.657
- I-- I can't!
- Please! You're the only one in
Las Vegas who knows our routine.

1108
01:07:22.747 --> 01:07:25.614
I can't! I mean, I have the dodgeball
championships at noon!

1109
01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:29.042
Oh, you'll be back in time!
I promise!

1110
01:07:29.128 --> 01:07:32.871
All right. I'll do it.

1111
01:07:32.966 --> 01:07:34.832
- Yes! Okay!
- I gotta tell the guys.

1112
01:07:34.926 --> 01:07:37.668
- No! No time. No time!
- I gotta tell the guys.

<i>Average Joe's are a 50-to-1 underdog here today.</i>

<i>No one is giving them much of a chance.
What do you think, Pep?</i>

1115
01:07:45.812 --> 01:07:48.895
Cotton? Hey. I spoke with White Goodman
before today's match...

1116
01:07:48.982 --> 01:07:52.566
and he told me that his team
really wants to win this one.

1117
01:07:52.652 --> 01:07:55.861
Right you are.
And the stage is set...

1118
01:07:55.947 --> 01:07:58.939
<i>for Darwin's cruelest play to unfold,
so don't go anywhere, folks.</i>

1119
01:07:59.033 --> 01:08:01.365
<i>The</i> schadenfreude
<i>is about to begin.</i>

1120
01:08:01.452 --> 01:08:04.069
I don't understand.
Why would Peter leave?

1121
01:08:04.163 --> 01:08:06.074
'Cause he knows we're gonna get killed
out there, that's why.

1122
01:08:06.165 --> 01:08:09.374
<i>Hey, that's not true.
I don't know why Peter left...</i>

1123
01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:11.451
but we can do this
without him.

1124
01:08:11.546 --> 01:08:14.459
We're just gonna have to figure it out.
Owen, you'll have to play.

1125
01:08:14.549 --> 01:08:16.290
Okay, yeah.

1126
01:08:16.384 --> 01:08:19.126
Great, but we'll still be
two players short.

1127
01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:22.133
We're still missin' the teenage love puppy
and Steve the Pirate.

1128
01:08:22.223 --> 01:08:24.931
Who's “Steve the Pirate”?

1129
01:08:25.018 --> 01:08:28.761
The only guy on our team
who dresses like a pirate.

1130
01:08:28.855 --> 01:08:34.021
Wait. There's a guy on our team
dressed like a pirate?

1131
01:08:34.110 --> 01:08:36.602
<i>And now, let's hear it for...</i>

1132
01:08:36.696 --> 01:08:41.941
<i>the West Davenport High School
Charging Donkeys!</i>

1133
01:08:42.035 --> 01:08:46.029
Donkeys! Whoo!

1134
01:08:47.206 --> 01:08:49.197
<i>Donkeys!</i>

1135
01:08:51.753 --> 01:08:54.165
<i>♪ Yo, yo, better listen up ♪</i>

1136
01:09:03.931 --> 01:09:06.923
- <i>♪ Whee ♪</i>
<i>- ♪ Around and around we go ♪</i>

1137
01:09:09.062 --> 01:09:12.475
♪ Yo, be donkeys ♪♪

1138
01:09:12.565 --> 01:09:15.182
- Wow! We did it!
- Holy cow!

1139
01:09:16.527 --> 01:09:18.734
Oh, it was perfect.
You were perfect.

1140
01:09:18.821 --> 01:09:21.939
- Oh, God! I gotta go!
- Wait, wait, wait. Aren't you
gonna stay for the trophy?

1141
01:09:22.033 --> 01:09:25.242
I'm sorry, Amber.
I got my own trophy to win.

1142
01:09:41.594 --> 01:09:43.551
Now I'm goin'.

1143
01:09:49.686 --> 01:09:53.725
<i>And here come the Globo Gym
Purple Cobras, led by White Goodman, all business.</i>

1144
01:09:53.815 --> 01:09:56.056
<i>We haven't seen Average Joe's yet.</i>

1145
01:09:56.150 --> 01:10:00.144
They still haven't made it to the court.
It could be a psychological ploy--

1146
01:10:00.238 --> 01:10:03.526
- or perhaps something worse.
- - They're definitely not on the court, Cotton.

1147
01:10:03.616 --> 01:10:05.983
- <i>Their absence is noticeable.</i>
- Thank you.

1148
01:10:06.077 --> 01:10:08.739
<i>And we'll be right back after
these words from our sponsor.</i>

1149
01:10:12.583 --> 01:10:15.951
Can I get a bottle of water?

1150
01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:20.918
Aren't you Peter La Fleur?

1151
01:10:21.008 --> 01:10:24.046
- Lance Armstrong?
- Yeah, that's me. But I'm a big fan of yours.

1152
01:10:24.178 --> 01:10:27.762
- Really?
- Yeah. I've been watchin' the dodgeball
tournament on the <i>Ocho.</i>

1153
01:10:27.849 --> 01:10:30.181
ESPN 8. I just can't get enough of it.

1154
01:10:30.268 --> 01:10:33.602
But good luck on the tournament. I'm pullin'
for you against those jerks from Globo Gym.

1155
01:10:33.688 --> 01:10:36.146
I think you better hurry up,
or you're gonna be late.

1156
01:10:36.232 --> 01:10:41.227
Uh-- Actually, I decided to quit,
Lance.

1157
01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:44.403
Quit? You know, once I was thinkin'
about quittin'...

1158
01:10:44.490 --> 01:10:47.027
when I was diagnosed with brain,
lung and testicular cancer...

1159
01:10:47.118 --> 01:10:49.200
all at the same time.

1160
01:10:49.287 --> 01:10:52.746
But with the love and support of my
friends and family, I got back on the bike...

1161
01:10:52.832 --> 01:10:55.699
and I won the Tour de France
five times in a row.

1162
01:10:55.793 --> 01:10:57.830
But I'm sure you have
a good reason to quit.

1163
01:11:00.131 --> 01:11:02.498
So what are you dyin' from
that's keepin' you from the finals?

1164
01:11:02.592 --> 01:11:06.586
Right now, it feels a little bit like...
shame.

1165
01:11:06.679 --> 01:11:10.263
Well, I guess if a person never
quit when the going got tough...

1166
01:11:10.349 --> 01:11:13.717
they wouldn't have anything
to regret for the rest of their life.

1167
01:11:13.811 --> 01:11:16.974
But good luck to you, Peter. I'm sure
this decision won't haunt you forever.

1168
01:11:25.072 --> 01:11:29.157
Steve? Steve the Pirate.
“Scurvy!”

1169
01:11:29.243 --> 01:11:31.826
No. Not ringin' any bells.

1170
01:11:31.913 --> 01:11:35.122
- Forget it, man.
- Please. We'll play with four people.

1171
01:11:35.208 --> 01:11:37.825
It's not an advantage!
Can't you bend the rules just this once?

1172
01:11:37.919 --> 01:11:41.128
There's nothing I can do!
Rules are rules.

1173
01:11:41.214 --> 01:11:44.627
You don't have enough players. Inform
the committee and Mr. Goodman...

1174
01:11:44.717 --> 01:11:47.960
- about Average Joe's forfeit.
- Yes, sir.

1175
01:11:48.054 --> 01:11:50.170
Better luck next year.

1176
01:11:51.474 --> 01:11:53.806
Excuse me!
Sorry I'm late.

1177
01:11:53.893 --> 01:11:55.884
You won't believe what just happened
to me, though.

1178
01:11:55.978 --> 01:11:59.016
- <i>Hey, guys. What's up?</i>
- You’re just in time to help us forfeit.

1179
01:11:59.106 --> 01:12:03.441
Forfeit? Why?

1180
01:12:03.528 --> 01:12:06.737
Well, I-I don't know
what to tell you, but--

1181
01:12:06.823 --> 01:12:10.942
<i>yes-- no-- I'm being told that Average Joe's
does not have enough players...</i>

1182
01:12:11.035 --> 01:12:13.652
<i>and will be forfeiting
the championship match.</i>

1183
01:12:13.746 --> 01:12:17.159
It's a bold strategy. Cotton.
Let's see if it pays off for them.

1184
01:12:17.250 --> 01:12:21.539
To the tournament floor we go for the scepter
presentation from the dodgeball chancellor.

1185
01:12:22.964 --> 01:12:25.171
Ladies and gentlemen!

1186
01:12:25.258 --> 01:12:28.341
By the power vested in me
by our governing body...

1187
01:12:28.427 --> 01:12:32.091
the American Dodgeball
Association of America...

1188
01:12:32.181 --> 01:12:34.673
<i>and in concordance
with our sponsors...</i>

1189
01:12:34.767 --> 01:12:36.883
<i>Lumber Liquidators
and Omaha Steaks...</i>

1190
01:12:36.978 --> 01:12:41.188
it gives me great pleasure
to declare the winner of this year's...

1191
01:12:41.274 --> 01:12:44.312
Las Vegas International
Tournament to be--

1192
01:12:44.402 --> 01:12:46.439
<i>Wait! He's here!</i>

1193
01:12:51.284 --> 01:12:53.742
Hey, guys.
Sorry I'm late.

1194
01:12:53.828 --> 01:12:57.196
- I'm ready to play, Your Honor.
- Too late, La Fleur.

1195
01:12:57.290 --> 01:12:59.372
Your lovable band of
losers already forfeited.

1196
01:12:59.458 --> 01:13:01.369
- The trophy and the money are mine.
- He's right.

1197
01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:03.417
Your team has already forfeited.
There's nothing you can do.

1198
01:13:03.504 --> 01:13:07.293
<i>Facial, La Fleur! Total facial!</i>

1199
01:13:07.383 --> 01:13:10.250
<i>Actually, that's not true.</i>

1200
01:13:10.344 --> 01:13:13.712
The Tournament Committee can overturn
the chancellor's decision-- that's you, sir--

1201
01:13:13.806 --> 01:13:15.843
- by a two-thirds vote.
- No, he's right. He's right.

1202
01:13:15.933 --> 01:13:18.300
- What?
- Yeah. So it's a bylaw. It's a-- Give it--

1203
01:13:18.394 --> 01:13:20.635
Will you-- It's a bylaw!

1204
01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:25.099
- What's a “bylaw?”
<i>- Hang on a second here, folks.</i>

1205
01:13:25.192 --> 01:13:30.028
- Let them play!
<i>- We might just have a championship game yet!</i>

1206
01:13:30.114 --> 01:13:34.358
<i>Listen to this crowd!</i>

1207
01:13:34.452 --> 01:13:38.696
<i>Unbelievable! Well, Pepper, it's clear
what the crowd here wants.</i>

1208
01:13:38.789 --> 01:13:41.531
But the committee members
have the final say.

1209
01:13:41.626 --> 01:13:43.663
And it looks like
they've come to a decision.

1210
01:13:43.753 --> 01:13:46.620
- Let them play! Let them play!
- <i>Joe's needs two yes votes to play--</i>

1211
01:13:46.714 --> 01:13:48.751
<i>There's one thumbs-up.</i>

1212
01:13:48.841 --> 01:13:51.173
- <i>Good news for Joe's.</i>
- Oh! Oh, please.

1213
01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:53.547
<i>Let's see how our
second judge votes.</i>

1214
01:13:53.638 --> 01:13:57.256
- Thank you for a little sanity.
- <i>Oh, tough sledding! It's all even.</i>

1215
01:13:57.350 --> 01:14:01.765
<i>Their fate hangs on the thumb
of our final judge.</i>

1216
01:14:01.854 --> 01:14:05.438
<i>Thumbs up!
Average Joe's can play!</i>

1217
01:14:05.524 --> 01:14:08.687
That is pure poppycock!
You're gonna let them do that?

1218
01:14:08.778 --> 01:14:12.237
- Thank you, Chuck Norris.
- Thank you, Peter.

1219
01:14:14.075 --> 01:14:17.158
All right, captains. Shake hands,
and let's have a clean match!

1220
01:14:17.244 --> 01:14:19.861
Good luck, White.

1221
01:14:20.957 --> 01:14:24.621
Cram it up your cramhole,
La Fleur.

1222
01:14:24.710 --> 01:14:28.169
Prepare to be humiliated
on cable television.

1223
01:14:28.255 --> 01:14:30.371
Whatever.

1224
01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:35.635
- Nice of you to show up.
- Yeah, I thought so too.

1225
01:14:35.721 --> 01:14:38.509
What? I got a plan.

1226
01:14:40.434 --> 01:14:43.643
Okay, guys. Let's play smart.
Wait for your two-on-ones.

1227
01:14:43.729 --> 01:14:46.642
Cover closely for your pickups.
What's our team motto?

1228
01:14:46.732 --> 01:14:48.973
- Aim low?
- That's right.

1229
01:14:49.068 --> 01:14:51.935
All I'm asking is that
your give it your best for Patches.

1230
01:14:52.029 --> 01:14:56.318
I say we go out there, we let it all hang loose,
try to have some fun.

1231
01:14:56.409 --> 01:14:59.151
I mean, it's only dodgeball, right?

1232
01:14:59.245 --> 01:15:03.079
- Put 'em in. One, two, three--
- Joe's!

1233
01:15:26.605 --> 01:15:28.596
Globo Gym ready!

1234
01:15:28.691 --> 01:15:30.773
<i>Average Joe's ready!</i>

1235
01:15:33.571 --> 01:15:37.314
- Dodgeball
<i>- The championship
match is underway.</i>

1236
01:15:37.408 --> 01:15:40.321
<i>Average Joe's versus
the Globo Gym goliath.</i>

1237
01:15:40.411 --> 01:15:45.872
<i>Ooh! Quick elimination there for Kate Veatch.</i>

1238
01:15:45.958 --> 01:15:49.872
<i>White Goodman's hit!
The ball goes up for grabs, and...</i>

1239
01:15:49.962 --> 01:15:53.830
- <i>it's caught!</i>
- That's a catch!
- You're out, La Fleur!

1240
01:15:53.924 --> 01:15:58.885
<i>Peter La Fleur has got to sit out, and
Joe's has lost their two best players early.</i>

1241
01:15:58.971 --> 01:16:03.932
<i>Dwight Baumgarten still playing hard.
Hits Me'Shell Jones right on the dome!</i>

1242
01:16:04.018 --> 01:16:07.261
You're mine next time!

1243
01:16:07.354 --> 01:16:10.688
- Hyah!
- <i>Oh! Right in the</i> tokhes.

1244
01:16:10.775 --> 01:16:14.313
<i>Two-one, ese,
and Globo Gym is dominating.</i>

1245
01:16:18.365 --> 01:16:20.823
- Hi.
- Hey.

1246
01:16:23.037 --> 01:16:25.495
- You're out! You're out!
- <i>I don't know what that was all about.</i>

1247
01:16:25.581 --> 01:16:28.323
<i>But it leaves Joe's on the wrong side
of a 4-2 advantage.</i>

1248
01:16:30.461 --> 01:16:33.499
<i>Joe's gets an elimination.
It's two on three.</i>

1249
01:16:33.589 --> 01:16:36.081
- Get out!
- <i>Gordo!</i>

1250
01:16:36.175 --> 01:16:39.839
Lose your temper, Gordo. Get mad!

1251
01:16:39.929 --> 01:16:42.887
<i>White Goodman with a catch! Gordon Pibb
goes out, Me'Shell Jones comes back in.</i>

1252
01:16:42.973 --> 01:16:45.681
Whoo! You're out, four-eyes!

1253
01:16:45.768 --> 01:16:48.851
<i>It's all up to Average Joe's
youngest member.</i>

1254
01:16:48.938 --> 01:16:51.555
- He's gotta make a play here, Pepper.
- Yeah, word, Cotton.

1255
01:16:51.649 --> 01:16:54.391
<i>Four Cobras and one Joe.</i>

1256
01:16:54.485 --> 01:16:58.399
<i>Even a rabid mongoose wouldn't have
a chance now-- Oh! Nice dodge!</i>

1257
01:16:58.489 --> 01:17:00.321
- Stay alive! Stay alive! Stay alive!
- Catch one!

1258
01:17:02.743 --> 01:17:04.825
<i>They're just toying
with the young man now.</i>

1259
01:17:04.912 --> 01:17:06.903
<i>He's got to avoid getting hit here, Cotton.</i>

1260
01:17:06.997 --> 01:17:09.739
- <i>That's the key.</i>
- Justin, let's go, let's go.

1261
01:17:09.834 --> 01:17:13.498
<i>Oh! That's a great catch! And another!</i>

1262
01:17:13.587 --> 01:17:15.999
<i>Peter La Fleur comes back
into the game!</i>

1263
01:17:16.090 --> 01:17:18.548
Just like that,
a three-player swing.

1264
01:17:18.634 --> 01:17:21.843
- Joe's isn't done yet.
- Justin!

1265
01:17:21.929 --> 01:17:25.547
- I love you!
- I love you t--

1266
01:17:25.641 --> 01:17:29.259
<i>Joanie Loves Chachi!</i>

1267
01:17:29.353 --> 01:17:31.720
Two players left on each side.
What a match.

1268
01:17:31.814 --> 01:17:36.729
What a sport! Throw out the rule book,
folks. It's down and dirty now.

1269
01:17:36.819 --> 01:17:39.402
<i>Street dodgeball.</i>

1270
01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:44.949
<i>Look out! La Fleur goes down.
He's a sitting duck!</i>

1271
01:17:45.035 --> 01:17:49.996
Noooo!

1272
01:17:50.082 --> 01:17:53.950
<i>How about that, folks? Kate Veatch
takes the dodgeball bullet for Peter La Fleur.</i>

1273
01:17:54.044 --> 01:17:56.251
<i>Now, that's sacrifice!</i>

1274
01:17:56.338 --> 01:17:59.421
<i>As touching a moment as we've seen
on the dodgeball court all tournament.</i>

1275
01:18:01.385 --> 01:18:04.252
- Hey!
- <i>Oh, a blatant cheap shot from White Goodman.</i>

1276
01:18:04.346 --> 01:18:07.555
That's court misconduct! That's a warning!

1277
01:18:07.641 --> 01:18:09.552
Oh, come on!
Gimme a break!

1278
01:18:10.769 --> 01:18:13.306
- You okay? Jesus.
- Yeah. I'm fine.

1279
01:18:13.397 --> 01:18:15.229
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I'm all right. I'm all right.

1280
01:18:15.316 --> 01:18:18.354
- It was an accident! Come on!
I thought she was in play.
- Not a chance.

1281
01:18:18.444 --> 01:18:21.687
We're sweating like greased monkeys
out here! I can't hold on to a ball.

1282
01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:24.989
- <i>Sorry, miss, but you're out.
You got to get off the court.</i>
- Right.

1283
01:18:25.075 --> 01:18:27.362
- Watch him, man! Come on.
- Hey, Peter!

1284
01:18:27.453 --> 01:18:30.662
- Yeah?
- Kick his ass.

1285
01:18:30.748 --> 01:18:34.457
- <i>Here comes the in-game restart</i>
- Players, to your positions!

1286
01:18:34.543 --> 01:18:39.037
<i>Looks like it's gonna be a two-on-one,
a ménage à trois of pain.</i>

1287
01:18:39.131 --> 01:18:41.793
Usually you pay double
for that kind of action, Cotton.

1288
01:18:44.970 --> 01:18:48.588
<i>You're playing ready dodgeball.
Balls are at your feet.</i>

1289
01:18:48.682 --> 01:18:51.014
Ready? Dodgeball!

1290
01:18:51.101 --> 01:18:54.389
It's a cat-and-mouse game,
folks. Peter La Fleur...

1291
01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:57.142
<i>has got to wait for his shot.</i>

1292
01:18:58.901 --> 01:19:03.361
<i>He gets the elimination!</i>

1293
01:19:03.447 --> 01:19:09.193
<i>Oh, my! Globo Gym wins.
A Cinderella story cast asunder.</i>

1294
01:19:09.286 --> 01:19:11.903
<i>Average Joe's has
come all this way for nothing.</i>

1295
01:19:11.997 --> 01:19:15.456
- <i>Absolutely nothing.</i>
<i>- They're not gonna get anything, Cotton.</i>

1296
01:19:15.542 --> 01:19:19.285
<i>No elimination! Double fault!</i>

1297
01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:21.542
Double fault! You stepped
over the line on the throw!

1298
01:19:21.632 --> 01:19:23.464
- <i>Double fault!</i>
- What?

1299
01:19:23.550 --> 01:19:25.917
You out of your mind?
That is the worst call I have ever seen!

1300
01:19:26.011 --> 01:19:28.969
I'm out here bustin' my butt, and you
come in here with a bush-league call like that?

1301
01:19:29.056 --> 01:19:33.596
- That is total bullcrap!
- A.D.A.A. continuation rule 113-D, sir.

1302
01:19:33.686 --> 01:19:36.804
- Sudden death!
- All right! Bring it!

1303
01:19:36.897 --> 01:19:40.356
<i>I don't believe it, folks. Sudden death!</i>

1304
01:19:40.442 --> 01:19:44.686
Well, let me tell ya.
A double-fault final play elimination...

1305
01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:48.273
hasn't occurred since
the Helsinki episode of 1919.

1306
01:19:48.367 --> 01:19:51.109
And I think we all remember
how that turned out.

1307
01:19:51.203 --> 01:19:55.322
Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to witness
the greatest happening in sport.

1308
01:19:55.416 --> 01:19:57.703
Sudden-death dodgeball.

1309
01:19:57.793 --> 01:20:00.251
- Pepper needs new shorts!
- Oh!

1310
01:20:02.214 --> 01:20:05.423
<i>White, Peter--
this is sudden death.</i>

1311
01:20:05.509 --> 01:20:09.343
Only striking an opposing
player eliminates him.

1312
01:20:09.430 --> 01:20:11.637
Catching the ball does nothing.

1313
01:20:11.724 --> 01:20:15.763
Both feet must remain
in the triangle at all times.

1314
01:20:15.853 --> 01:20:18.094
You may throw anytime
after my call.

1315
01:20:18.188 --> 01:20:21.476
<i>Understood?</i>

1316
01:20:21.567 --> 01:20:25.105
<i>Okay. Let's have a clean match.
Good luck, gentlemen.</i>

1317
01:20:25.195 --> 01:20:28.563
This is it, “La Loser.”

1318
01:20:30.034 --> 01:20:34.824
You ready for the--
whoo-- hurricane?

1319
01:20:34.913 --> 01:20:38.577
Just don't go cryin' to mama when I spank you
in front of all these people, White.

1320
01:20:39.918 --> 01:20:42.000
You don't go cryin'
to your daddy...

1321
01:20:42.087 --> 01:20:44.875
after I wipe it up
with your face.

1322
01:20:46.383 --> 01:20:48.590
- Uh, White?
- Yeah?

1323
01:20:48.677 --> 01:20:51.294
You look awful fat
in those pants.

1324
01:20:51.388 --> 01:20:53.675
<i>Players to your positions!</i>

1325
01:20:53.766 --> 01:20:57.054
<i>Sudden death is all about
gamesmanship, folks. Throw too early...</i>

1326
01:20:57.144 --> 01:21:00.512
<i>and you're defenseless;
throw too late and you're eliminated.</i>

1327
01:21:00.606 --> 01:21:04.099
<i>Dilemma,
thy name is dodgeball.</i>

1328
01:21:04.193 --> 01:21:07.311
This sport doesn't build character,
it reveals it.

1329
01:21:07.404 --> 01:21:10.442
“F”-in' “A”, Cotton.
“F”-in' “A”!

1330
01:21:12.284 --> 01:21:14.400
Come on, talk to me.

1331
01:21:16.121 --> 01:21:18.237
Listen up, crotch stain.

1332
01:21:18.332 --> 01:21:22.872
Remember your training,
and trust your instincts.

1333
01:21:22.961 --> 01:21:25.578
You can do it!
I believe in you.

1334
01:21:27.633 --> 01:21:30.295
Bye-bye.

1335
01:21:30.386 --> 01:21:34.425
- Right.
<i>- Players turn, and step in.</i>

1336
01:21:50.197 --> 01:21:54.191
- What the hell's he doin'?
- I don't know.

1337
01:21:57.079 --> 01:22:01.619
- Get a load of this guy.
- <i>In 23 years of broadcasting...</i>

1338
01:22:01.708 --> 01:22:03.745
I thought I'd seen it all,
folks, but it looks like...

1339
01:22:03.836 --> 01:22:06.749
Peter La Fleur has
actually blindfolded himself.

1340
01:22:06.839 --> 01:22:09.627
Yeah, he will not be able
to see very well, Cotton.

1341
01:22:18.642 --> 01:22:21.725
Ready?

1342
01:22:25.899 --> 01:22:29.893
Dodgeball!

1343
01:22:35.033 --> 01:22:39.368
Good-bye, Peter.
I always knew you were weak.

1344
01:22:43.417 --> 01:22:46.535
Air Goodman, comin' at ya!

1345
01:22:54.386 --> 01:22:57.504
<i>Down goes Goodman!
Down goes Goodman!</i>

1346
01:22:57.598 --> 01:23:00.511
Winner! Average Joe's!

1347
01:23:04.354 --> 01:23:08.689
- Wow!
<i>- Do you believe in unlikelihoods?</i>

1348
01:23:08.775 --> 01:23:13.485
<i>Average Joe's shocking the dodgeball world
and upsetting Globo Gym...</i>

1349
01:23:13.572 --> 01:23:15.734
<i>in the championship match.</i>

1350
01:23:15.824 --> 01:23:20.318
- Unbelievable!
- Ladies and gentlemen, I have
been to the Great Wall of China.

1351
01:23:20.412 --> 01:23:24.326
I have seen the pyramids of Egypt. I've
even witnessed a grown man satisfy a camel.

1352
01:23:24.416 --> 01:23:26.874
But never, in all my years
as a sportscaster...

1353
01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:32.000
<i>have I witnessed something as improbable--
as impossible-- as what we've witnessed today.</i>

1354
01:23:32.090 --> 01:23:35.173
<i>The little team that could--
Average Joe's Gymnasium...</i>

1355
01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:38.753
<i>underdogs throughout--
stand before us aglow...</i>

1356
01:23:38.847 --> 01:23:41.965
as true dodgeball champions.

1357
01:23:42.059 --> 01:23:46.724
<i>On behalf of the American Dodgeball
Association of America...</i>

1358
01:23:46.813 --> 01:23:51.182
it is my honor to present to you
this check of $50,000!

1359
01:23:57.866 --> 01:24:00.699
What are you so happy about, La Fleur?
None of this matters.

1360
01:24:00.786 --> 01:24:03.369
<i>You signed your gym
over to me last night. Remember?</i>

1361
01:24:03.455 --> 01:24:07.449
<i>You lost. I won.
Suck failure, freaks.</i>

1362
01:24:07.543 --> 01:24:10.911
Peter, is that true?

1363
01:24:11.004 --> 01:24:16.545
Yeah, it's true. It's true I sold
Average Joe's to White.

1364
01:24:16.635 --> 01:24:19.218
It's true that
every man has his price.

1365
01:24:19.304 --> 01:24:23.969
<i>And it's also true that money won
is a lot sweeter than money earned.</i>

1366
01:24:24.059 --> 01:24:27.643
- Now he's a “philosophizer”.
- Excuse us. Step aside, please.

1367
01:24:29.606 --> 01:24:31.973
Here are your winnings,
Mr. La Fleur. Congratulations.

1368
01:24:32.067 --> 01:24:34.604
- Right on time. I appreciate it. Thank you, boys.
- What is that? Who is that?

1369
01:24:34.695 --> 01:24:37.437
- Wh-What winnings? What is that?
- <i>Gosh, I forgot to tell you.</i>

1370
01:24:37.531 --> 01:24:42.276
I took the $100,000 bribe that you gave me
last night and I put it on us to win.

1371
01:24:42.369 --> 01:24:47.614
We were goin' off at 50-to-1. Anyone? Top
of your head? What's 50 times $100,000?

1372
01:24:47.708 --> 01:24:53.078
- $50,000?
- Five million dollars! Peter, are you kidding me?

1373
01:24:53.171 --> 01:24:55.458
Surprise!

1374
01:24:58.468 --> 01:25:01.756
Stick it in your ear, La Fleur.
I wouldn't sell you your gym back...

1375
01:25:01.847 --> 01:25:03.884
for all of King Midas's silver.

1376
01:25:03.974 --> 01:25:05.965
The gym is mine!
So you can take your band...

1377
01:25:06.059 --> 01:25:08.847
of yellow-bellied losers
and crawl out of here.

1378
01:25:08.937 --> 01:25:12.726
You're right. I can't make you sell
Average Joe's back to me, so...

1379
01:25:12.816 --> 01:25:16.059
I guess I'll just take your advice
and invest in something.

1380
01:25:16.153 --> 01:25:18.565
Say, uh, the controlling
stake of Globo Gym.

1381
01:25:18.655 --> 01:25:20.271
That's preposterous! I'd never allow it.

1382
01:25:20.365 --> 01:25:23.983
<i>Globo Gym is a publicly-traded company,
there is nothing you can do about it.</i>

1383
01:25:24.077 --> 01:25:29.789
<i>So, I would control Globo Gym
and everything that Globo Gym owns...</i>

1384
01:25:29.875 --> 01:25:33.834
which, as of last night,
is Average Joe's Gym!

1385
01:25:35.422 --> 01:25:37.754
- I'm your new boss, White.
— You can't be my boss!

1386
01:25:37.841 --> 01:25:40.173
Nobody's my boss. I'm my own boss!
I created myself!

1387
01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:43.423
- You're fired, pal.
- You can't do anything to me!

1388
01:25:43.513 --> 01:25:47.006
You're goin' down, La Fleur.
You're going down like a sweet muffin!

1389
01:25:47.100 --> 01:25:50.764
- Another time. Another time.
- <i>You suck, La Fleur!</i>

1390
01:25:52.606 --> 01:25:54.722
Give me that!

1391
01:25:57.653 --> 01:26:00.862
- I mean, the blindfold was crazy.
- <i>Hey, hey.</i>

1392
01:26:00.947 --> 01:26:04.360
Peter.

1393
01:26:04.451 --> 01:26:06.909
Look, it's Steve the Pirate.

1394
01:26:09.498 --> 01:26:12.707
- Wow.
- I just wanted to tell you...

1395
01:26:12.793 --> 01:26:14.955
that I thought about
what you said...

1396
01:26:15.045 --> 01:26:19.334
and...
I guess you're right.

1397
01:26:19.424 --> 01:26:21.756
I'm not really a pirate.

1398
01:26:23.261 --> 01:26:25.844
I don't know, Steve.

1399
01:26:25.931 --> 01:26:30.801
I mean, if you're not a pirate, who the hell
am I gonna split all that buried treasure with?

1400
01:26:33.313 --> 01:26:36.305
Gar.

1401
01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:39.984
- Peter--
- Gar, Steve.

1402
01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:44.405
It's beautiful.
Hyah-hah!

1403
01:26:45.951 --> 01:26:47.988
We missed you.

1404
01:26:51.123 --> 01:26:54.912
- Hey, you.
- Hey, you.

1405
01:26:56.628 --> 01:26:58.619
- Joyce?
- Kate!

1406
01:26:58.714 --> 01:27:02.048
- What are you doing here?
I thought you were in Guam.
- I caught an earlier flight.

1407
01:27:02.134 --> 01:27:05.627
- I wouldn't have missed this for the world.
- You are amazing.

1408
01:27:09.641 --> 01:27:14.181
- I told you she was a lesbian.
- Wow. Good call.

1409
01:27:14.271 --> 01:27:17.855
Hey! I'm not a lesbian.

1410
01:27:17.941 --> 01:27:19.602
You're not?

1411
01:27:19.693 --> 01:27:22.685
No. I'm bisexual.

1412
01:27:25.115 --> 01:27:27.277
Oh! Snap!

1413
01:27:27.367 --> 01:27:31.452
All right. Everybody?
Smile big.

1414
01:27:36.418 --> 01:27:40.332
Hi, I'm Peter La Fleur, owner
and operator of Average Joe's Gym.

1415
01:27:40.422 --> 01:27:44.131
And I'm here to tell ya,
you're perfect just the way you are.

1416
01:27:44.217 --> 01:27:47.130
But if you feel like losin' a few pounds,
gettin' healthier...

1417
01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:49.587
and makin' some good friends
in the process...

1418
01:27:49.681 --> 01:27:51.672
then Joe's is the place for you.

1419
01:27:51.767 --> 01:27:55.431
Don't forget that youth dodgeball classes
are forming right now.

1420
01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:57.557
So come on down
and learn a great game...

1421
01:27:57.647 --> 01:27:59.638
the way it's supposed
to be played.

1422
01:27:59.733 --> 01:28:01.815
- Right, kids?
