Cover yourself up, Ella.
We're not there yet. Good girl.

7
00:00:57,324 --> 00:01:00,243
Sh, sh, sh. Not our stop yet.

00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:46,364
Stand clear of the doors.

13
00:02:40,924 --> 00:02:42,764
Excuse me.

14
00:02:46,604 --> 00:02:49,004
Is everything all right in there?

15
00:03:16,004 --> 00:03:18,923
Sorry, madam. You wouldn't mind
looking after my kids

16
00:03:18,924 --> 00:03:20,883
for a minute, would you?
I'll be right back.

17
00:03:20,884 --> 00:03:22,381
Yeah. No problem.

18
00:03:22,406 --> 00:03:24,204
Thank you very much. I'll be right back.

00:03:29,044 --> 00:03:31,563
Suspicious in toilet C-D.

20
00:03:31,564 --> 00:03:34,003
Sergeant David Budd, Metropolitan Police.

21
00:03:34,004 --> 00:03:35,124
What's going on?

22
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,860
You've got an intelligence report
for an Asian male in his 20s?

23
00:03:40,564 --> 00:03:41,763
How do you know about that?

24
00:03:41,764 --> 00:03:43,843
I saw you checking out
the guy in my carriage.

25
00:03:43,844 --> 00:03:46,283
He's fine but I saw someone
acting suspiciously at Marston.

26
00:03:46,284 --> 00:03:48,323
I don't know if he succeeded
in boarding the train

27
00:03:48,324 --> 00:03:49,780
but, if he did,
he could be in the toilet.

28
00:03:51,684 --> 00:03:53,563
Look, I'm an Operational
Firearms Commander

29
00:03:53,564 --> 00:03:56,364
with Specialist Protection.
What's the plan?

30
00:04:00,804 --> 00:04:03,443
British Transport Police have
put out an alert on a possible

31
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:06,163
suicide bomber attempting to
board a London-bound service.

32
00:04:06,164 --> 00:04:08,323
We've been ordered to stop
the train at Barnet Shed.

33
00:04:08,324 --> 00:04:10,883
It's a derelict depot out in the sticks.

34
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:13,443
SO 19... SCO19.

35
00:04:13,444 --> 00:04:15,163
They're going to board the train.

36
00:04:15,164 --> 00:04:16,964
How long till we get there?

37
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,723
- Seven minutes.
- He won't detonate in the toilet.

38
00:04:20,724 --> 00:04:23,100
He'll go into the carriage
for maximum casualties.

39
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,700
Right, stick with me on this.
What's your name?

40
00:04:26,404 --> 00:04:29,043
- Sandra.
- Give me your number.

41
00:04:29,044 --> 00:04:34,323
Uh... 07700900876.

42
00:04:34,324 --> 00:04:35,844
- I need to call this in.
- Do it.

43
00:04:51,364 --> 00:04:54,844
This way, Sarge.
We'll take you down to track-side.

44
00:05:19,644 --> 00:05:22,083
I need a few more minutes.
Is that all right?

45
00:05:22,084 --> 00:05:24,324
- Yeah. No problem.
- Thank you.

There's dozens of
passengers on this train,

51
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:00,483
- my kids included.
- What?

52
00:06:00,484 --> 00:06:02,723
Can you unlock the exit doors
while the train's moving?

53
00:06:02,724 --> 00:06:04,444
- DISCONNECT BEEPS
- Hello?

54
00:06:06,524 --> 00:06:08,364
Shit.

Shit.

00:06:18,364 --> 00:06:19,724

What I said is can you...?

00:06:37,644 --> 00:06:40,203
The stop's just a few minutes away.
Let's not do anything to...

61
00:06:40,204 --> 00:06:42,568
If he feels the train brake,
he'll know it's an unscheduled stop.

62
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,881
He'll go into the carriage and
detonate the device. No.

63
00:06:44,882 --> 00:06:47,260
Can you unlock the doors while
the train's moving or not?

64
00:06:48,004 --> 00:06:50,563
- Yes.
- When I say so, do it.

65
00:06:50,564 --> 00:06:52,804
- Let me take care of the rest.
- The rest of what?

66
00:06:54,084 --> 00:06:55,960
To throw him off the train.

67
00:07:02,857 --> 00:07:04,017
Stand by.

68
00:07:19,604 --> 00:07:21,124
Do it now.

69
00:08:00,244 --> 00:08:02,883
Subject does not appear
to be carrying a device.

70
00:08:02,884 --> 00:08:05,483
He's an Asian male, late 20s,
wearing a black baseball cap,

71
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:07,643
grey T-shirt and carrying a green coat.

72
00:08:07,644 --> 00:08:10,723
Advise SCO19 he's heading towards
the front of the train and does not

73
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:13,764
appear to be a threat. Repeat,
does not appear to be a threat.

74
00:08:17,124 --> 00:08:19,900
I'm going to examine the toilet
for signs of a device.

75
00:08:20,564 --> 00:08:22,483
Trojan, Control, active message.

00:08:27,724 --> 00:08:29,083
Proceed as planned.

80
00:08:29,084 --> 00:08:31,963
- Copy.
- Train ETA's three minutes.

81
00:08:31,964 --> 00:08:33,404
Three minutes!

That's all.

86

I can see you're as scared as I am.

00:09:14,764 --> 00:09:16,804
Miss, I just want to help you.

88
00:09:19,244 --> 00:09:20,604
You don't have to do this.

89
00:09:22,644 --> 00:09:24,300
You can change your mind.

90
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:27,403
Don't do that! Please don't do that!
Don't move. Stay still.

91
00:09:27,404 --> 00:09:31,323
Please. Just stay still.
Please! Just stay still. Don't move.

You don't want to do this.

You don't look like you do.

97
00:09:57,404 --> 00:10:00,603
Listen, the specialist
counter-terrorism unit

98
00:10:00,604 --> 00:10:03,883
already know about a potential
incident on this train.

99
00:10:03,884 --> 00:10:06,524
So what I'd like to do
is just tell them...

100
00:10:08,377 --> 00:10:09,857
...that you're willing to talk.

101
00:10:11,724 --> 00:10:13,620
Does that sound OK to you?

102
00:10:14,404 --> 00:10:16,302
Just talk, is that a start?

103
00:10:23,564 --> 00:10:25,683
There's a second bomber...

104
00:10:25,684 --> 00:10:27,403
...but we're talking.

105
00:10:27,404 --> 00:10:29,123
Now write this down.

106
00:10:29,124 --> 00:10:30,963
Young Asian female,

107
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,123
equipped with an explosives vest.

108
00:10:33,124 --> 00:10:36,163
Advise SCO19 she's willing to talk.

109
00:10:36,164 --> 00:10:40,883
Request armed officers hold back
from boarding the train

110
00:10:40,884 --> 00:10:43,163
and that bomb disposal and negotiators

111
00:10:43,164 --> 00:10:45,443
are deployed as operational priority.

112
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:49,603
But firstly, right now,
evacuate the adjacent carriages.

113
00:10:49,604 --> 00:10:51,500
Yeah. OK.

114
00:10:56,164 --> 00:10:58,603
This is your guard speaking.

115
00:10:58,604 --> 00:11:01,603
Would all passengers in carriage D

116
00:11:01,604 --> 00:11:06,963
please make your way at once
into carriages E and F?

117
00:11:06,964 --> 00:11:11,483
And would all passengers in
carriage C please make your way

118
00:11:11,484 --> 00:11:14,443
- immediately into carriages B and A?
- Come on, wake up. We've got to move.

119
00:11:14,444 --> 00:11:16,444
- Where's Daddy?
- Wake up.

120
00:11:17,015 --> 00:11:18,134
I'll just have a look

121
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:21,163
and make sure that everyone's
getting out all right. OK?

122
00:11:21,164 --> 00:11:24,380
All right? I'm not going anywhere.
I'm staying right here.

123
00:11:32,204 --> 00:11:36,004
It's OK. It's OK.

124
00:11:37,324 --> 00:11:39,123
My name's David.

125
00:11:39,124 --> 00:11:40,883
David Budd.

126
00:11:40,884 --> 00:11:42,124
What's yours?

127
00:11:50,004 --> 00:11:51,204
Nadia.

128
00:11:52,524 --> 00:11:54,923
The man that was in here before,

129
00:11:54,924 --> 00:11:57,124
is that your husband?

130
00:12:00,444 --> 00:12:01,764
Yeah?

131
00:12:03,404 --> 00:12:05,524
And your husband wants you to die?

132
00:12:07,604 --> 00:12:10,123
You don't have to be a martyr, Nadia.

133
00:12:10,124 --> 00:12:12,323
We can deactivate this device

134
00:12:12,324 --> 00:12:14,403
and we can protect you from your husband.

135
00:12:14,404 --> 00:12:17,460
You don't ever have to see him
again if you don't want to.

136
00:12:19,804 --> 00:12:21,803
Hey, Nadia.

137
00:12:21,804 --> 00:12:23,020
Nadia, look at me.

138
00:12:24,364 --> 00:12:27,763
I'm just as scared as you are, I promise.

139
00:12:27,764 --> 00:12:30,884
I'm just bringing my kids back
from visiting my mum.

140
00:12:32,724 --> 00:12:34,643
You have children?

141
00:12:34,644 --> 00:12:36,620
Yes. I do. Two.

142
00:12:39,004 --> 00:12:42,660
That's Ella. She's ten.
Charlie. He's eight.

143
00:12:45,844 --> 00:12:48,220
I just want to take them home
to their mum.

144
00:12:57,764 --> 00:13:01,363
Trojan, Control, we've got
a sit rep from the train guard.

145
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:04,203
There's an off-duty specialist
protection officer on board.

146
00:13:04,204 --> 00:13:05,963
PS David Budd.

147
00:13:05,964 --> 00:13:07,180

Stand by.

149
00:13:13,644 --> 00:13:15,060
It's all right.

150
00:13:15,724 --> 00:13:17,883

Stop! Please! Stop!
Listen to me. Listen to me.

154
00:13:24,844 --> 00:13:27,643
Why would someone you love want
you to kill yourself?

155
00:13:27,644 --> 00:13:29,403
You've been brainwashed.

156
00:13:29,404 --> 00:13:31,403
He has. You have.

157
00:13:31,404 --> 00:13:33,123
And I know.

158
00:13:33,124 --> 00:13:35,682
I was in Afghanistan.
I saw mates get killed.

159
00:13:35,683 --> 00:13:38,043
Nearly got killed myself.
For what? Nothing.

160
00:13:38,044 --> 00:13:41,003
Politicians. Cowards and liars.
Ours and theirs.

161
00:13:41,004 --> 00:13:43,763
People full of talk but will never
spill a drop of their own blood.

162
00:13:43,764 --> 00:13:46,923
But you and I,
we're just collateral damage.

163
00:13:46,924 --> 00:13:48,980
Don't let them win, Nadia.

164
00:13:49,964 --> 00:13:51,284
Don't let them win.

165
00:13:57,364 --> 00:14:00,020
Police officer! Don't shoot!

166
00:14:03,924 --> 00:14:06,723
All right? Stay right here.
I'm not going anywhere.

167
00:14:06,724 --> 00:14:08,643
- You hear that?
- INDISTINCT VOICES

168
00:14:08,644 --> 00:14:11,083
That's them evacuating
everyone from the train.

169
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:12,483
So it's just you and I.

170
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:15,120
It's just us here. OK?

171
00:14:15,724 --> 00:14:19,843
- Armed police! Armed police!
- Get down on the ground!

172
00:14:19,844 --> 00:14:23,923
Put your hands on your head
and get down! Get down!

173
00:14:23,924 --> 00:14:25,620
Don't move!

174
00:14:29,724 --> 00:14:34,300
Stay exactly where you are, Nadia.
Don't move, OK? All right.

175
00:14:35,004 --> 00:14:36,603
Armed Police!

176
00:14:36,604 --> 00:14:39,483

00:14:39,484 --> 00:14:41,803
We know who you are! Stand clear!

178
00:14:41,804 --> 00:14:45,163
It's all right. I'm not going anywhere.

179
00:14:45,164 --> 00:14:48,843
Just stay very still now, Nadia. OK?

180
00:14:48,844 --> 00:14:50,363
David, work with me, yeah?

181
00:14:50,364 --> 00:14:53,683
You've done a great job
but you're not OFC here. I am.

182
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:56,963
I need you to stand down, nice and easy.

183
00:14:56,964 --> 00:14:59,843
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm staying right here with you.

184
00:14:59,844 --> 00:15:03,083
It's all right. Nothing's changed.
It's just us talking here.

185
00:15:03,084 --> 00:15:07,284
- Just stay, really, really still.
- OK? Move... away... from the subject.

186
00:15:14,924 --> 00:15:16,250
In position.

187
00:15:16,275 --> 00:15:18,643
It's OK, Nadia. It's all right. It's OK.

188
00:15:18,644 --> 00:15:21,883
TFC reports sniper in position.
Critical shot authorised.

189
00:15:21,884 --> 00:15:23,003
Received.

190
00:15:23,004 --> 00:15:25,444
Nadia, I need you to trust me.

191
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,563
I'm going to turn round
and speak to this officer.

192
00:15:28,564 --> 00:15:31,003
She's cooperating.
She intends to surrender.

193
00:15:31,004 --> 00:15:34,163
She does not intend to activate
the device. Get Expo here.

194
00:15:34,164 --> 00:15:36,060
They're here. Now move away.

195
00:15:37,284 --> 00:15:40,460
It's all right. It's OK.
I'm not going anywhere. I'm not.

196
00:15:40,461 --> 00:15:42,483
David, stand clear.

197
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:46,083
Nadia, you need to show them you're
not going to detonate the device.

198
00:15:46,084 --> 00:15:47,203
Now, when I ask you to,

199
00:15:47,204 --> 00:15:49,643
I want you to raise your arms
either side of you.

200
00:15:49,644 --> 00:15:51,003
Can you do that for me when I ask?

201
00:15:51,004 --> 00:15:52,803
This is your final warning. Stand clear!

202
00:15:52,804 --> 00:15:55,044
Nadia's going to spread her arms

203
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,483
and we're going to stay put
and wait for Expo.

204
00:15:58,484 --> 00:16:00,363
Trojan OFC to TFC.

205
00:16:00,364 --> 00:16:03,083
PS Budd has been given repeated
warnings to stand down but has

206
00:16:03,084 --> 00:16:05,683
failed to cooperate. We have
no clear shot of the subject.

207
00:16:05,684 --> 00:16:08,083
That's it, nice and slow.
Stay close to me.

208
00:16:08,084 --> 00:16:10,803
Come in. Come in, close to me. That's it.

209
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:12,883
All right, doing really well.

210
00:16:12,884 --> 00:16:15,123
Doing really well, Nadia.

211
00:16:15,124 --> 00:16:17,323
That gun, that's an MCX carbine.

212
00:16:17,324 --> 00:16:19,643
A bullet from that would go
through the both of us.

213
00:16:19,644 --> 00:16:22,483
I'm trusting they're not going
to shoot one of their own.

214
00:16:22,484 --> 00:16:25,140
All right? You trust me too?

215
00:16:26,644 --> 00:16:27,684
OK.

216
00:16:29,404 --> 00:16:30,964
Shit.

217
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,163
Shit. Oh, come on.

218
00:16:33,164 --> 00:16:35,643
Control to Sniper 1.
Do you have a clean shot?

219
00:16:35,644 --> 00:16:37,003
Negative.

220
00:16:37,004 --> 00:16:40,683
Stay in there. Don't go out.
Stay here. Stay here with me.

221
00:16:40,684 --> 00:16:43,603
Subject required out of toilet
for critical shot.

222
00:16:43,604 --> 00:16:46,323
- Received.
- Get Expo here, now!

223
00:16:46,324 --> 00:16:49,577
David, I need the subject
to step out of the toilet.

224
00:16:49,578 --> 00:16:51,816
No, she's going to stay here
and wait for Expo.

225
00:16:51,817 --> 00:16:54,003
- That's what we're going to do.
- Don't move. Come out of the toilet.

226
00:16:54,004 --> 00:16:56,563
- Come out of the toilet.
- Stay really still for me, will you?

227
00:16:56,564 --> 00:16:58,700
- That's it. You're doing really good.
- Out now, miss. Listen to me.

228
00:16:58,701 --> 00:17:00,755
- Get Expo here.
- David, stand aside.

229
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,868
Don't fire! Do not do this!

230
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:08,723
- You need to come out of the toilet!
- Don't do this! Don't do this!

231
00:17:08,724 --> 00:17:11,083
Nadia, stay there, don't move.
Please don't move, Nadia!

232
00:17:11,084 --> 00:17:13,403
- Step out of the toilet!
- Don't do this. Don't do this.

233
00:17:13,404 --> 00:17:15,563
- Please don't do this.
- David, stand down! Out! OUT!

234
00:17:15,564 --> 00:17:18,992
- Stay here! That's it. Don't do this!
- Get out of the fucking toilet!

235
00:17:18,993 --> 00:17:20,200
No!

236
00:17:25,884 --> 00:17:30,083
- No shot!
- All right. Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

237
00:17:30,084 --> 00:17:32,941
All right, Nadia. Hold tight. That's it.

238
00:17:32,942 --> 00:17:35,243
Just keep moving. Hold tight.

239
00:17:35,244 --> 00:17:39,420
OK. All right.

240
00:17:41,444 --> 00:17:44,603
Control to Sniper 1.
Can you execute critical shot?

241
00:17:44,604 --> 00:17:46,060
Negative.

242
00:17:46,884 --> 00:17:48,500
That's it, Nadia.

243
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:54,023
No clean shot available.
Repeat, no clean shot available.

244
00:17:55,644 --> 00:17:58,524
- Expo.
- Control. Sending Expo in now.

245
00:17:59,684 --> 00:18:01,483
Expo is coming.

246
00:18:01,484 --> 00:18:02,980
Thank you.

247
00:18:03,924 --> 00:18:06,084
All right, Nadia. I've got you.

248
00:18:15,364 --> 00:18:16,804
Explosives officer.

249
00:18:18,284 --> 00:18:22,523
Stay calm. Stay calm.

250
00:18:22,524 --> 00:18:25,443
Miss? My name's Karen.

251
00:18:25,444 --> 00:18:28,044
Now I need you to put your arms down.

252
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:32,310
Good. Now turn your palms towards me...

253
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:35,144
...and do not move.

254
00:18:38,564 --> 00:18:40,683
Nadia, I'm going to step to the side.

255
00:18:40,684 --> 00:18:42,460
I'll be right here.

256
00:18:43,644 --> 00:18:45,644
I'm moving towards you now.

257
00:18:47,204 --> 00:18:50,740
Nadia, now I need to ask you...

258
00:18:51,484 --> 00:18:55,044
...this object in your hand
is the initiation device?

259
00:18:56,684 --> 00:18:58,163
Yes.

260
00:18:58,164 --> 00:19:00,724
Does anyone else have
control of this device?

261
00:19:04,637 --> 00:19:05,797
No.

262
00:19:08,204 --> 00:19:10,164
Straighten your arm, please.

263
00:19:35,644 --> 00:19:37,044
Arms up, please.

264
00:19:38,564 --> 00:19:39,604
All the way up.

265
00:19:41,964 --> 00:19:43,404
Turn around for me, please.

266
00:19:47,124 --> 00:19:49,124
I'm going to remove the belt.

267
00:20:21,644 --> 00:20:23,283
I need everyone out now.

268
00:20:23,284 --> 00:20:24,564
Open the door.

269
00:20:31,524 --> 00:20:34,963
I'm going to step off the train,
then ask you to follow me.

270
00:20:34,964 --> 00:20:36,524
All right?

271
00:20:43,724 --> 00:20:45,700
OK, nice and slowly.

272
00:20:46,124 --> 00:20:48,244
Keep your hands where we can see them.

273
00:20:56,404 --> 00:20:57,607
Stay calm.

274
00:20:57,632 --> 00:20:59,606
Stay still and we'll lift
you down to the ground.

275
00:20:59,607 --> 00:21:01,283
- Stay still!
- Nadia!

276
00:21:01,284 --> 00:21:05,083
Don't look over there. Look down at
the ground. Down at the ground.

277
00:21:05,084 --> 00:21:08,084
Go! Go! Let's go!

278
00:21:13,804 --> 00:21:16,883
It's over. You're safe now.

279
00:21:16,884 --> 00:21:19,540
He can't hurt you.
No-one's going to hurt you.

280
00:21:51,964 --> 00:21:53,844
Come on. Out you get.

281
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,498
- Thanks, mate.
- Oh, God.

282
00:21:58,523 --> 00:22:00,403
- Mummy!
- Thank God! Come here.

283
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:01,940
Oh.

284
00:22:02,524 --> 00:22:05,003
Oh, sweetheart.

285
00:22:05,004 --> 00:22:08,924
Sorry. By the time
I'd given a statement, I...

286
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,616
- Love, it's all right.
- Thank you.

287
00:22:11,617 --> 00:22:13,460
I'm fine. Look, we're all fine.

288
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:15,643
It's all right.

289
00:22:15,644 --> 00:22:18,714
Night-night, sweetheart. I love you.

290
00:22:18,715 --> 00:22:21,403
Night-night, Charlie bear. Goodnight.

291
00:22:21,404 --> 00:22:23,843
Night-night, sweetheart.

292
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:26,523
Night, big man. Night.

293
00:22:26,524 --> 00:22:28,324
- I love you.
- I love you too.

294
00:22:42,084 --> 00:22:44,060
They'll be all right, love.

295
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:46,483
I should be heading off.

296
00:22:46,484 --> 00:22:47,724
You don't have to.

297
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:51,778
You sure?

298
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:55,004
Are you feeling OK?

299
00:23:06,044 --> 00:23:08,164
Come on. Let's talk downstairs.

300
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,730
Oh, for Christ's sake, Dave.

301
00:23:16,364 --> 00:23:17,820
Sorry.

302
00:23:19,844 --> 00:23:22,323
I'm sorry. I'm a fucking idiot.

303
00:23:22,324 --> 00:23:23,844
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

304
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:40,541
NEWS REPORTS: Terrorists armed
with a suicide vest

305
00:23:40,542 --> 00:23:43,403
boarded the London-bound train
just before...

306
00:23:43,404 --> 00:23:45,643
...the Prime Minister has called a
meeting of Cobra...

307
00:23:45,644 --> 00:23:47,163
No-one was injured in the attack

308
00:23:47,164 --> 00:23:49,563
on a packed train en route to
London Euston Station.

309
00:23:49,564 --> 00:23:51,879
...and we would urge members of
the public to remain vigilant...

310
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,803
...the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre

311
00:23:53,804 --> 00:23:55,403
will assess the current threat level.

312
00:23:55,404 --> 00:23:56,763
My Government remains resolute

313
00:23:56,764 --> 00:23:58,603
in our determination
to root out terrorism.

314
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:01,843
JTAC has the raised the threat
level from moderate to substantial.

315
00:24:01,844 --> 00:24:05,043
What I'm being told is most
worrying about yesterday's incident

316
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:08,723
is the exceptionally high level of
sophistication of the explosive vest

317
00:24:08,724 --> 00:24:10,643
employed by the would-be attackers.

318
00:24:10,644 --> 00:24:14,163
It would appear most likely that
this is the work of a terror cell

319
00:24:14,164 --> 00:24:17,283
and there may well be
accomplices still at large.

320
00:24:17,284 --> 00:24:19,763
Frank Gardner, there,
our security correspondent.

321
00:24:19,764 --> 00:24:21,483
- Morning, Sarge.
- Cheers, Ken.

322
00:24:21,484 --> 00:24:23,963
...the level of sophistication
of the 1st of October device

323
00:24:23,964 --> 00:24:27,763
and the very real concern that it
represents a new and devastating

324
00:24:27,764 --> 00:24:31,883
threat to national security has led
the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre

325
00:24:31,884 --> 00:24:36,243
to raise the UK's terror threat
level to substantial.

326
00:24:36,244 --> 00:24:38,419
We're joined now by the Home Secretary,

327
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,923
the Right Honourable Julia Montague, MP.

328
00:24:40,924 --> 00:24:44,643
Before we begin, Nick, I'd like
to pay tribute to the courage of

329
00:24:44,644 --> 00:24:47,083
all members of the police
and security service

330
00:24:47,084 --> 00:24:50,524
whose selfless actions prevented
an appalling act of terrorism.

331
00:24:58,924 --> 00:25:00,963
Bit of a day yesterday.

332
00:25:00,964 --> 00:25:03,643
If you need some time off or for me
to refer you to occ health

333
00:25:03,644 --> 00:25:06,163
- for some counselling...
- I'm fine, thanks, ma'am.

334
00:25:06,164 --> 00:25:07,763
It's a miracle you're in one piece.

335
00:25:07,764 --> 00:25:09,858
We're all very lucky the
bomber changed her mind.

336
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:10,976
Hm.

337
00:25:10,977 --> 00:25:14,243
Not that she's saying much.
And the husband's saying nothing.

338
00:25:14,244 --> 00:25:17,403
It seems like when the time came
she froze and the husband panicked.

339
00:25:17,404 --> 00:25:18,444
Yeah.

340
00:25:19,924 --> 00:25:23,163
Great job, David. A credit to the branch.

341
00:25:23,164 --> 00:25:24,660
Thank you, ma'am.

342
00:25:25,244 --> 00:25:28,283
So far you've acted as PPO to
visiting foreign dignitaries?

343
00:25:28,284 --> 00:25:29,683
That's right, ma'am.

344
00:25:29,684 --> 00:25:31,003
The commissioner's ordered me

345
00:25:31,004 --> 00:25:34,003
to review specialist protection
on senior politicians.

346
00:25:34,004 --> 00:25:36,483
I'm assigning you to a Cabinet minister.

347
00:25:36,484 --> 00:25:38,323
The Home Secretary.

348
00:25:38,324 --> 00:25:39,940
Very good, ma'am.

349
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,300
It's a move up.

350
00:25:42,764 --> 00:25:44,324
Yes.

351
00:25:44,604 --> 00:25:46,004
Thank you, ma'am.

352
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,190
Good man.

353
00:25:50,263 --> 00:25:51,623
Ma'am.

354
00:26:32,384 --> 00:26:36,666

355
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,740
_

356
00:27:16,124 --> 00:27:18,044
My Glock and two magazines, please.

357
00:27:49,724 --> 00:27:52,083
That's the principal now,
skipper, in the first car.

358
00:27:52,084 --> 00:27:53,323
The backup's behind.

359
00:27:53,324 --> 00:27:56,564
Her driver's Terry
and the PPO's PC Tom Fenton.

360
00:28:01,924 --> 00:28:03,443
- Ma'am.
- Kim.

361
00:28:03,444 --> 00:28:05,883
Ma'am, this is PS Budd, the new PPO.

362
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:08,363
Pleasure to meet you, ma'am.
I was wondering if we could

363
00:28:08,364 --> 00:28:10,923
discuss you using the underground
entrance from now on?

364
00:28:10,924 --> 00:28:12,564
I'm late for a meeting.

365
00:28:13,857 --> 00:28:15,577
Julia likes to be seen.

366
00:28:26,524 --> 00:28:29,203
- What's happening with Andrew Marr?
- I'll chase them today.

367
00:28:29,204 --> 00:28:30,763
I thought it was all confirmed.

368
00:28:30,764 --> 00:28:33,763
There's a possibility
that Number 10 want the slot.

369
00:28:33,764 --> 00:28:35,963
And when were you planning to tell me?

370
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,243
I was waiting for the right moment.

371
00:28:38,244 --> 00:28:39,684
You didn't find it.

372
00:28:46,084 --> 00:28:48,723
Sierra Zulu 7-2 from Control.

373
00:28:48,724 --> 00:28:50,563
Go ahead, Control. 7-2 over.

374
00:28:50,564 --> 00:28:55,163
7-2, do you have an ETA for Tulip
to arrive at Melbourne?

375
00:28:55,164 --> 00:28:59,284
Control, traffic is heavy,
ETA 12 minutes. 7-2 over.

376
00:29:00,884 --> 00:29:04,844
7-2, can you call up when
one minute away? Control out.

377
00:29:36,684 --> 00:29:39,203
Rob Macdonald, special advisor
to the Home Secretary.

378
00:29:39,204 --> 00:29:40,323
Leave a message.

379
00:29:40,324 --> 00:29:42,963
Hi, it's me. We need to catch up.

380
00:29:42,964 --> 00:29:44,443
Come to the flat.

381
00:29:44,444 --> 00:29:47,364
Not sure what time I'll be home.
Depends on the traffic.

382
00:29:51,884 --> 00:29:54,180
Cross the river and take the south circ.

383
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:57,123
Terry's been driving me for three years.

384
00:29:57,124 --> 00:29:59,564
I think he can be trusted to
determine the fastest route.

385
00:30:00,644 --> 00:30:02,283
I've made a dynamic risk assessment

386
00:30:02,284 --> 00:30:05,203
and, given the current threat level,
I'm recommending a diversion.

387
00:30:05,204 --> 00:30:07,043
How much longer will that take?

388
00:30:07,044 --> 00:30:09,403
Can't say for certain, ma'am.

389
00:30:09,404 --> 00:30:12,403
In that case we'll just take the
usual route, please, Terry.

390
00:30:12,404 --> 00:30:14,043
Take the south circ, if you don't mind.

391
00:30:14,044 --> 00:30:17,003
My job's to keep you safe, ma'am.
I won't tell you how to do yours.

392
00:30:17,004 --> 00:30:19,420
No, but you're happy to make it harder.

393
00:30:31,484 --> 00:30:35,380
47-79, we'll park up across
the road and wait.

394
00:30:51,804 --> 00:30:53,084
Ma'am.

395
00:31:01,884 --> 00:31:04,804
If you wouldn't mind holding
here a moment, please, ma'am.

397

Hi.

398
00:31:16,185 --> 00:31:17,483
I've just remembered I've got nothing in.

399
00:31:17,484 --> 00:31:19,042
Are you all right to pick up a takeaway?

400
00:31:19,067 --> 00:31:20,163
Not a problem. Usual?

401
00:31:20,164 --> 00:31:21,580
Sure.

402
00:31:27,124 --> 00:31:28,980
May I ask what you're doing?

403
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,083
What's behind this door?

404
00:31:31,084 --> 00:31:32,923
My study.

405
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:35,763
Seriously? I'm expecting a colleague
and I need you to fuck off.

406
00:31:35,764 --> 00:31:36,804
No offence.

407
00:31:38,331 --> 00:31:39,571
None taken.

408
00:31:53,764 --> 00:31:56,203
That was us plotting
to build the Death Star.

409
00:31:56,204 --> 00:31:57,643
How long's this going to take?

410
00:31:57,644 --> 00:31:59,604
Can't say for certain, ma'am.

411
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:01,210
Just get on with it.

412
00:32:29,884 --> 00:32:32,603
- PC Knowles said your name's Budd.
- Yes, ma'am.

413
00:32:32,604 --> 00:32:36,030
The officer who prevented the 1st of
October rail attack. That was you?

414
00:32:36,031 --> 00:32:37,158
Yes, ma'am.

415
00:32:38,924 --> 00:32:40,363
It's been a long and trying day.

416
00:32:40,364 --> 00:32:42,820
I'm sorry we got off on the wrong foot.

417
00:32:43,877 --> 00:32:45,277
Thank you, ma'am.

418
00:32:48,597 --> 00:32:49,917
All is forgiven.

419
00:32:51,444 --> 00:32:52,963
As you wish, ma'am.

420
00:32:52,964 --> 00:32:55,244
No, really, I've been a total cow.

421
00:32:56,464 --> 00:32:58,024
All is forgiven.

422
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:07,700
Thank you.

423
00:33:09,484 --> 00:33:11,228
- Skip...
- Evening.

424
00:33:11,253 --> 00:33:13,388
Mr Macdonald visiting the principal.

425
00:33:18,644 --> 00:33:19,684
DOORBELL

426
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:25,570
I can get it.

Oh. Hello.

428
00:33:37,204 --> 00:33:38,524
Evening, sir.

429
00:33:39,644 --> 00:33:40,683
Rob Macdonald.

430
00:33:40,684 --> 00:33:42,803
Perfect timing. I'm starving.
Come through.

431
00:33:42,804 --> 00:33:44,163
Sergeant Budd won't be long.

432
00:33:44,164 --> 00:33:45,683
Actually, I'm all done, ma'am.

433
00:33:45,684 --> 00:33:46,883
Thank you, Sergeant.

434
00:33:46,884 --> 00:33:48,963
Couple of prawn crackers going
if you want some?

435
00:33:48,964 --> 00:33:50,284
No, thank you, sir.

436
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,730
- Have a good evening, ma'am.
- You too.

437
00:33:57,684 --> 00:33:59,324
I got this for later.

438
00:34:20,964 --> 00:34:22,443
Evening, lads.

439
00:34:22,444 --> 00:34:23,484
Skip.

You OK?

445
00:35:12,684 --> 00:35:14,724
Yeah. I'm just calling for a chat.

446
00:35:15,964 --> 00:35:17,444
About what?

447
00:35:20,644 --> 00:35:22,483
Just calling for a chat, Vic.

448
00:35:22,484 --> 00:35:23,963
What do you want?

449
00:35:23,964 --> 00:35:26,483
What do I want?
I'm just calling to say hello.

00:35:26,484 --> 00:35:28,163
Just missed you, that's all.

Why can't we just have a chat
like two normal adults, Vicky?

453
00:35:35,084 --> 00:35:37,180
This is not normal.

454
00:35:39,084 --> 00:35:42,683
Vicky, I've put a lid on it.
I'm handling things.

455
00:35:42,684 --> 00:35:46,483
I know what happens when you call
late with a few drinks inside you.

456
00:35:46,484 --> 00:35:48,083
I've not even had a few drinks.

NEWS REPORTS: There is a heightened
police presence at airports,

...ignited a debate on national security,

00:36:16,284 --> 00:36:18,323
which has the potential to
split the Government.

The Prime Minister,
considered a moderate...

472
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:23,123
The Home Secretary's efforts to
enhance surveillance powers through

473
00:36:23,124 --> 00:36:27,844
a new Regulation of Investigatory
Powers Bill, so-called RIPA-18...

474
00:36:34,404 --> 00:36:37,243
Home Secretary, two minutes till
I take you through to the studio.

475
00:36:37,244 --> 00:36:38,284
Thank you.

476
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:48,324
I bet the PM pulled out because he
knew you'd do a much better job.

477
00:36:48,577 --> 00:36:50,740
Sounds like a reason NOT to pull out.

478
00:36:53,364 --> 00:36:54,723
Your decaf.

00:36:54,724 --> 00:36:56,843

- Christ!
- Shit.

481
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,883
SHE LAUGHS. I'm sorry. Shut up.

482
00:37:02,884 --> 00:37:05,163
- Give her your blouse.
- It'll never fit.

483
00:37:05,164 --> 00:37:07,723
- Oh, for God's sake!
- Give her yours, then.

484
00:37:07,724 --> 00:37:09,883
I don't wear blouses, do I?

485
00:37:09,884 --> 00:37:11,723
Can we dry it out?

486
00:37:11,724 --> 00:37:14,220
Don't be ridiculous. There's no time.

487
00:37:14,924 --> 00:37:17,043
Fresh on this morning, ma'am.

488
00:37:17,044 --> 00:37:18,723
You've got to be kidding me.

489
00:37:18,724 --> 00:37:21,083
My shirts are altered to
fit over my ballistic vest

490
00:37:21,084 --> 00:37:23,980
so the chest-to-waist ratio
should be compatible.

491
00:37:24,404 --> 00:37:26,843
Well, don't all stand around gawping.

492
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:30,060
And you, fuck off and organise
Sergeant Budd a new shirt.

493
00:37:33,764 --> 00:37:35,900
You'll have to tuck it
under your jacket, ma'am.

494
00:37:36,777 --> 00:37:38,097
Thank you.

495
00:37:42,604 --> 00:37:44,083
Some privacy?

496
00:37:44,084 --> 00:37:45,404
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

497
00:38:02,004 --> 00:38:03,123
Home Secretary,

498
00:38:03,124 --> 00:38:06,123
just how anxious should we be
about this terrorist threat?

499
00:38:06,124 --> 00:38:08,123
Is there another one around the corner?

500
00:38:08,124 --> 00:38:09,563
We are a target.

501
00:38:09,564 --> 00:38:11,643
We can't be complacent.

502
00:38:11,644 --> 00:38:15,443
Now, I am committed to supporting
our security services

503
00:38:15,444 --> 00:38:18,923
by giving them greater powers
to confront greater threats.

504
00:38:18,924 --> 00:38:21,803
The Government is intent on
forcing through a beefed-up

505
00:38:21,804 --> 00:38:25,123
Regulation of Investigatory
Powers Act this year,

506
00:38:25,124 --> 00:38:29,043
RIPA-18 as it's been dubbed,
spearheaded by you,

507
00:38:29,044 --> 00:38:32,407
but critics are calling it
a snoopers' charter to monitor

508
00:38:32,408 --> 00:38:36,923
phone calls, e-mails and social
media without judicial review.

509
00:38:36,924 --> 00:38:41,323
Andrew, only those intent on acts
of violence have anything to fear.

510
00:38:41,324 --> 00:38:43,803
And the Prime Minister has been
quoted as saying that,

511
00:38:43,804 --> 00:38:45,283
"Lessons need to be learned

512
00:38:45,284 --> 00:38:47,963
"from our military interventions
in the Middle East."

513
00:38:47,964 --> 00:38:50,243
So what do you think
those lessons might be?

514
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:53,803
I can't see any justification
for believing the Taliban would

515
00:38:53,804 --> 00:38:57,443
govern Afghanistan in peace
and harmony, or Iraqi insurgents

516
00:38:57,444 --> 00:39:00,723
would ever have formed a stable
democracy, or Isis would ever

517
00:39:00,724 --> 00:39:04,043
form a state with which the world
could have diplomatic relations.

518
00:39:04,044 --> 00:39:08,163
And, Andrew, I certainly do not miss
the tyranny of Saddam Hussein.

519
00:39:08,164 --> 00:39:10,523
So what are the lessons to be learned?

520
00:39:10,524 --> 00:39:13,483
The Prime Minister has been
very clear on how we deal

521
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:15,963
with the present
and build a more secure future.

522
00:39:15,964 --> 00:39:19,403
That doesn't require
apologising for the past.

523
00:39:19,404 --> 00:39:23,243
TV: I can't see any justification
for believing the Taliban would

524
00:39:23,244 --> 00:39:26,843
govern Afghanistan in peace and
harmony, or Iraqi insurgents would

525
00:39:26,844 --> 00:39:29,484
ever have formed a stable democracy or...

526
00:39:31,004 --> 00:39:32,683
...and build a more secure future.

527
00:39:32,684 --> 00:39:36,500
That doesn't require
apologising for the past.

528
00:39:37,004 --> 00:39:39,764
...doesn't require
apologising for the past.

529
00:39:41,284 --> 00:39:44,564
That doesn't require
apologising for the past.

530
00:39:45,964 --> 00:39:49,683
...doesn't require
apologising for the past.

531
00:39:49,684 --> 00:39:53,963
...apologising for the past.
..apologising for the past.

532
00:39:53,964 --> 00:39:55,483
...apologising for the past.

533
00:39:55,484 --> 00:39:58,363
...apologising for the past.
..apologising for the past.

534
00:39:58,364 --> 00:40:01,884
FADING OUT: ..apologising for the
past... apologising for the past.

535
00:40:07,324 --> 00:40:11,163
Hello. Reception. Where? Yes, here he is.

536
00:40:11,164 --> 00:40:13,927
Security, they need you upstairs! Quick!

537
00:40:18,164 --> 00:40:19,620
Clear back!

538
00:40:42,444 --> 00:40:43,963
How can you treat me like that?

539
00:40:43,964 --> 00:40:45,763
You have had it in for me from day one!

540
00:40:45,764 --> 00:40:48,323
- Oh, stand there like a smug prat!
- Sergeant Budd, thank you.

541
00:40:48,324 --> 00:40:51,363
Sergeant Budd, would you kindly
escort Ms Dyson from the building

542
00:40:51,364 --> 00:40:54,442
and we can all get back to work?
Thank you.

543
00:40:54,443 --> 00:40:56,843
...for a job that you don't even
know what I do on a daily basis.

544
00:40:56,844 --> 00:41:00,181
Have you taken the time? No.
Because you are that arrogant.

545
00:41:00,182 --> 00:41:02,683
- Get back in your office! Narcissist!
- There's a cab coming for her.

546
00:41:02,684 --> 00:41:04,545
Oh, a cab! Keep your cab.

547
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:05,944
- You narcissistic, smug prick.
- Sorry.

548
00:41:05,945 --> 00:41:07,883
Good luck with your interview, darling!

549
00:41:07,884 --> 00:41:10,163
I wouldn't work here if I'm fucking paid.

550
00:41:10,164 --> 00:41:13,048
- Miss, will you come with me, please?
- No.

551
00:41:14,964 --> 00:41:18,180
Come on. Let's talk about it
downstairs. All right?

552
00:41:20,284 --> 00:41:21,524
SHE MUTTERS

553
00:41:31,284 --> 00:41:33,700
Can you not stand so close to me, please?

554
00:41:35,644 --> 00:41:38,803
Yeah, I'm just coming out
onto the street now.

555
00:41:38,804 --> 00:41:39,940
Thanks.

556
00:41:40,484 --> 00:41:42,123
Bit calmer?

557
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:43,563
If you don't want to deal with them,

558
00:41:43,564 --> 00:41:46,203
I can sort out sending on your
personal belongings.

559
00:41:46,204 --> 00:41:47,700
Thank you.

560
00:41:48,204 --> 00:41:49,723
What happened?

561
00:41:49,724 --> 00:41:52,643
They've started interviewing
candidates for my job.

562
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:54,843
Didn't even tell me they were
giving me the push. So...

563
00:41:54,844 --> 00:41:56,363
They didn't say why?

564
00:41:56,364 --> 00:41:59,363
There's no "they".
It's just her. Sociopath.

565
00:41:59,364 --> 00:42:01,281
God help anyone who sees through her.

566
00:42:01,282 --> 00:42:02,914
I thought they were sending you a cab.

567
00:42:02,915 --> 00:42:05,124
Yeah. I don't need their shitty cab.

568
00:42:22,964 --> 00:42:25,087
Sierra Zulu 7-9, Lavender inbound.

569
00:42:25,088 --> 00:42:27,363
This is a breakdown of the
additional powers sought by RIPA-18.

570
00:42:27,364 --> 00:42:29,243
Mind if I steal your boss
for a minute, Rob?

571
00:42:29,244 --> 00:42:31,708
Uh, sure. See you inside.

572
00:42:31,709 --> 00:42:34,084
Interesting TV interview.
You must be very proud.

573
00:42:34,085 --> 00:42:36,606
I'd like to get into the Chamber
if that's all right with you, Roger.

574
00:42:36,607 --> 00:42:38,483
Planning to hijack the
counter-terror debate for a bit more

575
00:42:38,484 --> 00:42:41,163
- shameless self-promotion?
- Is there a point to this conversation?

576
00:42:41,164 --> 00:42:43,471
- Why aren't you returning my calls?
- Pardon me, ma'am,

577
00:42:43,472 --> 00:42:45,483
for security reasons,
I'd prefer if you moved indoors.

578
00:42:45,484 --> 00:42:47,243
You work for us, Plod,
so wind your neck in.

579
00:42:47,244 --> 00:42:49,643
I'm the fucking Chief Whip
and when I call, you answer.

580
00:42:49,644 --> 00:42:52,123
We claim the centre ground
but you're heading off-piste.

581
00:42:52,124 --> 00:42:54,470
The PM can count on my full support.

582
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:57,603
Bullshit. He's weakened. You're making
a move for the leadership.

583
00:42:57,604 --> 00:42:59,883
Sir, ma'am, I really do
need you both to move inside.

584
00:42:59,884 --> 00:43:02,844
Can't you call your monkey off?
Throw him some nuts.

585
00:43:03,144 --> 00:43:04,584
I'm mixed-race.

586
00:43:13,844 --> 00:43:15,803
RINGING TONE

587
00:43:15,804 --> 00:43:17,763
- Hi.
- John. Roger Penhaligon.

588
00:43:17,764 --> 00:43:19,643
- You OK?
- No. Not great.

589
00:43:19,644 --> 00:43:23,243
I need to record my side of
a conversation with one of the PPOs.

590
00:43:23,244 --> 00:43:26,163
Are you? Biracial?

591
00:43:26,164 --> 00:43:27,460
No, ma'am.

592
00:43:29,564 --> 00:43:31,683
Right, where were we?

593
00:43:31,684 --> 00:43:33,283
Right. This is a summary

594
00:43:33,284 --> 00:43:36,484
of the limitations
in existing legislation...

595
00:43:53,284 --> 00:43:54,564
All clear, ma'am.

596
00:43:59,577 --> 00:44:00,737
Sergeant Budd.

597
00:44:11,044 --> 00:44:12,460
Your shirt.

598
00:44:13,284 --> 00:44:14,860
Thank you, ma'am.

599
00:44:15,244 --> 00:44:19,043
I'm sorry about Chanel. She took
her dismissal badly and my staff

600
00:44:19,044 --> 00:44:21,924
thought you'd be the best
person to deal with it.

601
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:24,444
If you can talk someone out of
blowing up a train...

602
00:44:30,604 --> 00:44:31,843
Want one?

603
00:44:31,844 --> 00:44:33,443
On duty, ma'am.

604
00:44:33,444 --> 00:44:35,243
Soft drinks in the fridge.

605
00:44:35,244 --> 00:44:37,100
No... thank you, ma'am.

606
00:44:37,964 --> 00:44:39,923
Do you prefer David or Dave?

607
00:44:39,924 --> 00:44:41,244
I answer to both, ma'am.

608
00:44:47,364 --> 00:44:49,342
You won't have heard yet

609
00:44:49,343 --> 00:44:52,323
but we are going to charge
the male 1st of October attacker.

610
00:44:52,324 --> 00:44:55,483
He appears to have plausible links
to Islamist terrorists,

611
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:58,083
though I'm not at liberty
to say more at this stage.

612
00:44:58,084 --> 00:44:59,723
That's good news. Thanks, ma'am.

613
00:44:59,724 --> 00:45:03,803
And thanks to you, his wife's alive
to assist with our inquiries.

614
00:45:03,804 --> 00:45:06,883
It seems I'm constantly finding
reasons to compliment you.

615
00:45:06,884 --> 00:45:08,740
Not quite constantly.

616
00:45:11,724 --> 00:45:13,500
Is there a Mrs Budd?

617
00:45:13,804 --> 00:45:16,563
Yes, ma'am. Vicky. We have two children.

618
00:45:16,564 --> 00:45:17,780
What are their names?

619
00:45:18,284 --> 00:45:20,060
Ella and Charlie.

620
00:45:21,484 --> 00:45:24,220
Your shifts must make
home life difficult.

621
00:45:26,964 --> 00:45:28,883
I'm sorry. That was private.
I shouldn't have.

622
00:45:28,884 --> 00:45:33,340
No, it's... You'd know, ma'am,
all these hours you work.

623
00:45:34,671 --> 00:45:36,631
Goes with the territory.

624
00:45:38,564 --> 00:45:40,660
Did you always want to be a politician?

625
00:45:41,124 --> 00:45:42,900
I hope you don't mind me asking that.

626
00:45:44,004 --> 00:45:46,163
I was a criminal barrister.

627
00:45:46,164 --> 00:45:49,403
I witnessed at first hand how
the causes of crime often

628
00:45:49,404 --> 00:45:53,963
have as much to do with a person's
upbringing and social circumstances.

629
00:45:53,964 --> 00:45:56,804
I sought a role in which
I could make a real difference.

630
00:46:01,764 --> 00:46:02,924
I'm keeping you.

631
00:46:05,857 --> 00:46:07,260
May I ask, ma'am...

632
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:11,940
...that interview you did on telly,
did you mean what you said?

633
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:15,244
I'm sorry?

634
00:46:15,584 --> 00:46:17,304
About the Middle East.

635
00:46:19,364 --> 00:46:22,460
See, I don't say only what
the people want to hear.

636
00:46:23,084 --> 00:46:27,300
I'm about doing the right thing
and making the hard choices.

637
00:46:27,924 --> 00:46:31,524
The thing is, David/Dave,
I don't need you to vote for me,

638
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:33,190
only to protect me.

639
00:46:36,124 --> 00:46:37,524
Rest assured, ma'am.

640
00:46:37,698 --> 00:46:39,298
I'll do what's required.

641
00:46:45,184 --> 00:46:46,624
Ma'am.

642
00:46:50,831 --> 00:46:51,871
DOOR CLOSES

643
00:47:02,284 --> 00:47:03,324
Skipper.

644
00:47:39,364 --> 00:47:40,844
HE SIGHS

645
00:48:05,764 --> 00:48:08,923
Sorry, I was just getting ready for work.

646
00:48:08,924 --> 00:48:11,820
I just wanted to apologise for
the other night.

647
00:48:13,097 --> 00:48:14,300
OK.

648
00:48:16,204 --> 00:48:18,923
I was just having a couple of rounds
of toast but I can make you some.

649
00:48:18,924 --> 00:48:20,644
You're all right, love. I'm fine.

650
00:48:21,844 --> 00:48:23,164
The kids not up yet?

651
00:48:25,324 --> 00:48:27,404
They're all right, aren't they?

652
00:48:27,884 --> 00:48:29,084
Sleepover.

653
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:31,603
Both of them?

654
00:48:31,604 --> 00:48:35,660
TV: RIPA-18 will give them that support.

655
00:48:36,784 --> 00:48:38,304
Vic?

656
00:48:40,204 --> 00:48:42,163
Look, don't take this the wrong way.

657
00:48:42,164 --> 00:48:45,403
I know you're disappointed
to miss the kids, but...

658
00:48:45,404 --> 00:48:47,363
...maybe that's why it's best
that you call ahead

659
00:48:47,364 --> 00:48:48,724
if you're going to come round.

660
00:48:54,624 --> 00:48:56,184
I was hoping we could talk.

661
00:48:57,964 --> 00:49:00,243
- Why?
- I've said I'm sorry.

662
00:49:00,244 --> 00:49:01,604
Yeah, you always are.

663
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:05,283
You need help, Dave.

664
00:49:05,284 --> 00:49:07,923
I need a job that pays the bills, Vic.

665
00:49:07,924 --> 00:49:10,363
Yes. And I keep covering for you
so that you can keep it

666
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:13,260
but I've stopped being able
to stand back and watch.

667
00:49:14,044 --> 00:49:15,443
You are getting worse, Dave.

668
00:49:15,444 --> 00:49:18,020
Love, I'm sorry,
but we can work through this.

669
00:49:21,111 --> 00:49:22,671
I've met someone.

670
00:49:27,844 --> 00:49:28,884
He was here?

671
00:49:30,737 --> 00:49:31,777
Overnight?

672
00:49:33,204 --> 00:49:34,364
Yes.

673
00:49:36,084 --> 00:49:38,043
- Still here?
- No.

674
00:49:38,044 --> 00:49:40,923
Look, I... I was going to tell you.

675
00:49:40,924 --> 00:49:43,723
You farm our kids out so you can
have your night together?

676
00:49:43,724 --> 00:49:46,843
They're with their school friends.
They've had a lovely time.

677
00:49:46,844 --> 00:49:48,043
Do they know?

678
00:49:48,044 --> 00:49:49,643
They think that he's a friend.

679
00:49:49,644 --> 00:49:50,684
Oh.

680
00:49:52,604 --> 00:49:53,884
Dave...

681
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:02,850
Dave?

682
00:50:05,364 --> 00:50:07,163
Let's not get divorced yet.

683
00:50:07,164 --> 00:50:11,300
Oh, God, no. We're not that serious
or anything. It's early days.

684
00:50:13,364 --> 00:50:15,324
In case anything happens to me at work...

685
00:50:16,451 --> 00:50:19,771
...you'll still get the pension
if we're legally married.

686
00:50:31,164 --> 00:50:33,843
That the Counter-Terrorism
and Security Act 2015

687
00:50:33,844 --> 00:50:36,580
simply does not go far enough.

688
00:50:37,724 --> 00:50:38,923
Hi. Chanel.

689
00:50:38,924 --> 00:50:40,580
Yeah, sorry.

690
00:50:41,604 --> 00:50:42,883
I hope here's OK.

691
00:50:42,884 --> 00:50:44,803
Oh, fine. Can I get you anything?

692
00:50:44,804 --> 00:50:47,164
- No, please, let me.
- Maybe later.

693
00:50:49,244 --> 00:50:52,057
Look, I know, but you
just always seemed open

694
00:50:52,058 --> 00:50:53,643
to the wider possibilities of a story,

695
00:50:53,644 --> 00:50:55,763
not one to regurgitate the press release.

696
00:50:55,764 --> 00:50:57,083
Thanks very much.

697
00:50:57,084 --> 00:50:58,963
And for getting in touch.

698
00:50:58,964 --> 00:51:00,763
Julia Montague's the woman of the hour,

699
00:51:00,764 --> 00:51:02,643
so my editor didn't take much persuading.

700
00:51:02,644 --> 00:51:05,363
"Woman of the hour."
Talk about an understatement.

701
00:51:05,364 --> 00:51:07,603
You weren't able to give me much
detail over the phone.

702
00:51:07,604 --> 00:51:09,580
Yeah, that's right. Well...

703
00:51:10,164 --> 00:51:12,563
...I just want to stop everyone
getting carried away

704
00:51:12,564 --> 00:51:15,083
with this idea that she's
such a brilliant politician.

705
00:51:15,084 --> 00:51:17,780
- How would you describe her?
- A sociopath.

706
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:20,683
The most dangerous person in the country.

707
00:51:20,684 --> 00:51:22,003
More dangerous than the people

708
00:51:22,004 --> 00:51:23,883
that she keeps calling
enemies of freedom.

709
00:51:23,884 --> 00:51:26,643
- How's she dangerous?
- She's got an agenda.

710
00:51:26,644 --> 00:51:31,380
To heighten fear, to destroy
debate and to seize power.

711
00:51:32,044 --> 00:51:34,443
What evidence do you have to
substantiate these claims?

712
00:51:34,444 --> 00:51:36,683
I've worked for two years
in the Home Office,

713
00:51:36,684 --> 00:51:39,860
most of that time in daily contact
with Julia Montague.

714
00:51:41,857 --> 00:51:43,697
You were fired, Chanel.

715
00:51:45,084 --> 00:51:46,124
Yeah.

716
00:51:47,244 --> 00:51:49,163
In Whitehall, this isn't a story,

717
00:51:49,164 --> 00:51:51,803
"Aide gets fired.
Aide bad-mouths minister."

718
00:51:51,804 --> 00:51:54,388
I'm trying to explain
how Julia's different.

719
00:51:54,389 --> 00:51:56,083
But you're not explaining
how you're different

720
00:51:56,084 --> 00:51:58,300
from any other disgruntled
former employee.

721
00:51:58,964 --> 00:52:02,323
You've got my number and e-mail
if you find something concrete.

722
00:52:02,324 --> 00:52:04,084
I hope things work out for you.

723
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:27,403
Are you getting in?
Do you want me to call someone?

724
00:52:27,404 --> 00:52:29,723
That's the last thing I want you to do.

725
00:52:29,724 --> 00:52:30,964
Open invitation.

726
00:52:58,644 --> 00:53:01,203
For decades, the West

727
00:53:01,204 --> 00:53:04,683
has been inflicting suffering
on the poor and powerless.

728
00:53:04,684 --> 00:53:08,660
The war in the desert, in the oil fields,

729
00:53:09,084 --> 00:53:12,443
we've brought it back
to the streets of Britain.

730
00:53:12,444 --> 00:53:14,723
There's kids growing up over here,

731
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:19,083
all they hear is what's been done
to families and friends over there.

732
00:53:19,084 --> 00:53:22,980
Who can blame them
if they want to push back?

733
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:32,763
And when they push back,

734
00:53:32,764 --> 00:53:36,404
our politicians act
like it's come from nowhere,

735
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:39,363
so they can pass laws
restricting our freedoms

736
00:53:39,364 --> 00:53:42,523
and order new attacks against
the so-called terrorists,

737
00:53:42,524 --> 00:53:47,020
and guess what?
The cycle of violence goes on.

738
00:53:49,004 --> 00:53:51,900
Always wondered if
you'd turn up some time.

739
00:53:52,444 --> 00:53:54,620
Soapbox is not really my thing, mate.

740
00:53:55,084 --> 00:53:57,060
That's not how you were in Helmand.

741
00:53:57,644 --> 00:53:59,780
That was a crazy time out there.

742
00:54:00,164 --> 00:54:01,883
I'm trying to put all that behind me.

743
00:54:01,884 --> 00:54:04,020
I'm making a proper go of civvy street.

744
00:54:04,844 --> 00:54:10,140
Put PTSD on your job application,
who's going to hire you, right?

745
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:12,820
Just because it's not visible...

746
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:20,443
Mate, you can't beat it on your own.

747
00:54:20,444 --> 00:54:22,380
The counselling sessions,

748
00:54:23,084 --> 00:54:25,540
they're really helpful.

749
00:54:25,844 --> 00:54:29,084
- There's a bunch of us now, good...
- I'm good, thanks.

750
00:54:35,284 --> 00:54:37,444
So what are you doing now?

751
00:54:37,790 --> 00:54:38,830
Police.

752
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:42,780
Doing what?

753
00:54:43,404 --> 00:54:44,683
Specialist protection.

754
00:54:44,684 --> 00:54:48,363
Government ministers.
Are you fucking kidding me?

755
00:54:48,364 --> 00:54:50,684
You're protecting those wankers?

756
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:54,483
You turn up after all this time
and tell me this shit?

757
00:54:54,484 --> 00:54:57,820
What's that about?
You've got a fucking nerve, mate.

758
00:54:59,124 --> 00:55:01,900
- I knew you'd understand.
- Understand what?

759
00:55:02,804 --> 00:55:04,763
You said it out in Helmand.

760
00:55:04,764 --> 00:55:05,923
You say a lot of stuff

761
00:55:05,924 --> 00:55:08,180
when you've seen your
best mates blown to pieces.

762
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:12,323
That if you ever found yourself
right beside one of those bastards

763
00:55:12,324 --> 00:55:13,603
that sent us out there,

764
00:55:13,604 --> 00:55:15,964
you'd just close your eyes
and pull the trigger.

765
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:19,243
You'd still have a face.

766
00:55:19,244 --> 00:55:20,884
I'd still have a family.

767
00:56:04,564 --> 00:56:06,164
Doors and seat belts.

768
00:56:09,444 --> 00:56:10,803
Little bird told me

769
00:56:10,804 --> 00:56:13,420
you were Johnny on the spot
at the 1st of October?

770
00:56:14,324 --> 00:56:15,763
Yes, sir.

771
00:56:15,764 --> 00:56:18,884
Looks like the Home Secretary
couldn't be in safer hands.

772
00:56:34,684 --> 00:56:36,364
Lavender outbound.
