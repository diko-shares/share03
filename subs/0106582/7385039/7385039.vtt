00:02:16.558 --> 00:02:19.430
<i>Rescue three.
Jessie, do you see him yet?</i>

2
00:02:20.391 --> 00:02:22.393
Patience, my love, patience.

3
00:02:26.317 --> 00:02:28.189
Wait a minute. I think I have him sighted.

4
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.941
Frank, what's the word?

5
00:02:31.573 --> 00:02:33.524
The word is we got him over there.

6
00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:40.081
<i>Rescue three, this is Rescue Center. Over.</i>

7
00:02:40.281 --> 00:02:41.492
This is three. Go ahead.

8
00:02:41.873 --> 00:02:43.454
<i>Jessie, we're getting general clearance</i>

9
00:02:43.534 --> 00:02:45.246
<i>in the southeastern region of the park.</i>

10
00:02:45.336 --> 00:02:48.669
<i>You will probably have sufficient
cloud base to get into the tower,</i>

11
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.092
<i>but please be advised
you'll still encounter</i>

12
00:02:51.172 --> 00:02:52.713
<i>some strong winds and turbulence.</i>

13
00:02:52.844 --> 00:02:55.756
<i>We would advise
against a winch rescue. Over.</i>

14
00:02:55.887 --> 00:02:59.300
Wilco, Center. I'll proceed
with wire cross from opposite tower.

15
00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.182
- Three out.
<i>- Center out.</i>

16
00:03:16.777 --> 00:03:18.909
Gabe, Hal's signalling he's OK.

17
00:03:21.742 --> 00:03:22.953
Gabe?

18
00:03:24.535 --> 00:03:25.626
Gabe, where are you?

19
00:03:26.377 --> 00:03:29.039
I'm just hanging out, Jess.

20
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.211
Oh, my God.

21
00:03:35.386 --> 00:03:38.639
I don't recognize the face,
but the butt does look vaguely familiar.

22
00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:41.552
<i>Hey, be careful,
or you'll embarrass old Frank.</i>

23
00:03:42.593 --> 00:03:44.845
It would take a heap more
than that, rock-jock.

24
00:03:45.185 --> 00:03:46.056
Yeah.

25
00:04:25.726 --> 00:04:26.727
Gabe?

26
00:04:27.057 --> 00:04:28.558
They're below the top of the tower.

27
00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:31.271
They're on the ledge just above you.

28
00:04:31.351 --> 00:04:32.562
You got another few feet.

29
00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.743
- Glad you could join us.
- Yeah, sure. Hi, Sarah.

30
00:04:42.823 --> 00:04:43.653
Hi, Gabe.

31
00:04:44.574 --> 00:04:46.747
So, how's the knee?

32
00:04:46.827 --> 00:04:49.249
I think it's out. No big deal.

33
00:04:49.329 --> 00:04:53.003
Oh, yeah, I remember when you twisted it
getting out of that hot tub.

34
00:04:53.623 --> 00:04:55.966
I thought it was
an old war wound from 'Nam.

35
00:04:56.877 --> 00:04:58.548
Really? Hmm.

36
00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:03.223
Rescue three.
I've located a stranded climber.

37
00:05:03.343 --> 00:05:05.926
Jessie, please send down a transport line.

38
00:05:17.237 --> 00:05:18.738
So, tell me, how you feeling?

39
00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:20.150
Fine, considering.

40
00:05:21.241 --> 00:05:23.032
What do you say we take off...

41
00:05:24.074 --> 00:05:26.906
and leave this clown behind, huh?

42
00:05:26.996 --> 00:05:28.198
Don't tempt me.

43
00:05:35.415 --> 00:05:36.546
Rescue three.

44
00:05:37.086 --> 00:05:41.130
Please be advised that Ranger Walker
is making advances toward my girlfriend...

45
00:05:41.211 --> 00:05:44.093
<i>that's liable to get his ass kicked
right off this mountain. Over.</i>

46
00:05:44.884 --> 00:05:47.056
Be informed Gabe
makes advances to me only

47
00:05:47.136 --> 00:05:50.019
or he'll be climbing down
4,000 feet and sleeping outside.

48
00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:52.562
Baby, he lies.

49
00:06:25.675 --> 00:06:28.598
- Is it really 4,000?
- Yeah, just about.

50
00:06:28.678 --> 00:06:33.142
Hey, remember, whatever this guy says
about me, don't believe it, OK?

51
00:06:33.512 --> 00:06:34.393
Thanks.

52
00:06:46.235 --> 00:06:48.577
OK. Come on over.

53
00:06:53.082 --> 00:06:56.535
I know you're nervous,
but we've done this a hundred times, OK?

54
00:06:56.625 --> 00:06:57.626
- Mm-hmm.
- Mmm?

55
00:06:59.338 --> 00:07:00.209
OK?

56
00:07:02.131 --> 00:07:04.293
Excuse me, Captain Hot Tub?

57
00:07:06.135 --> 00:07:08.717
Keep your arms and legs
inside the vehicle at all times. OK?

58
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.851
All right, that's great, Hal.

59
00:07:12.931 --> 00:07:14.223
Hey!

60
00:07:14.353 --> 00:07:16.435
That really inspires confidence.

61
00:07:23.272 --> 00:07:26.655
So, how did this clown talk you
into climbing up to the tower?

62
00:07:26.735 --> 00:07:28.447
He told me it was better than sex.

63
00:07:29.118 --> 00:07:29.988
Really?

64
00:07:33.492 --> 00:07:35.534
You ready
for the best ride in the park?

65
00:07:35.994 --> 00:07:37.956
- Give me a second. I'll let you know.
- OK.

66
00:07:50.589 --> 00:07:52.551
Ah, you look like hell.

67
00:07:53.051 --> 00:07:53.972
He made it.

68
00:07:54.052 --> 00:07:55.934
Of course he did. Of course he did.

69
00:07:56.014 --> 00:07:57.766
Really, there's nothing to it.

70
00:07:58.186 --> 00:07:59.978
OK, I can do this.

71
00:08:00.058 --> 00:08:01.480
Sure you can.

72
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:03.812
I'm sorry for all the trouble, really.

73
00:08:03.902 --> 00:08:05.944
- Oh, Sarah, don't worry about it. Really.
- Thanks.

74
00:08:06.525 --> 00:08:09.568
- Did you see that?
- Yeah, yeah.

75
00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:14.492
- We're still on for dinner tonight, right?
- Of course we are.

76
00:08:14.573 --> 00:08:15.453
OK.

77
00:08:17.115 --> 00:08:19.247
- OK. You're ready now.
- OK.

78
00:08:19.327 --> 00:08:20.498
That's it.

79
00:08:23.872 --> 00:08:25.834
Now, just sit right down into it.

80
00:08:28.877 --> 00:08:30.428
Come on, guys. The wind's picking up.

81
00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:34.262
All right, Sarah,
just keep your eyes on me.

82
00:08:34.342 --> 00:08:35.974
No, don't look... Sarah.

83
00:08:36.054 --> 00:08:38.596
Sarah, look...
Sarah, look at me. That's it.

84
00:08:38.686 --> 00:08:40.849
- Right.
- Just start to pull.

85
00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:43.641
<i>One hand after another. That's it.</i>

86
00:08:43.731 --> 00:08:47.105
<i>Sarah, You're doing great...
really, great. Keep goin'.</i>

87
00:08:48.106 --> 00:08:49.988
And just keep looking at me.

88
00:08:51.449 --> 00:08:53.611
Sarah, that's great!
You're starting to look like a pro.

89
00:08:53.701 --> 00:08:54.822
Keep going.

90
00:08:55.573 --> 00:08:56.905
That's it. Nice and easy.

91
00:08:57.495 --> 00:08:59.657
Hey, Hal,
we're gonna be out of a job soon.

92
00:08:59.998 --> 00:09:02.210
All right, a little more, Sarah.

93
00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:03.411
That's it.

94
00:09:03.911 --> 00:09:04.792
That's it.

95
00:09:05.043 --> 00:09:06.874
One, two.

96
00:09:10.798 --> 00:09:11.669
Sarah?

97
00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:13.471
- Oh, God!
- Sarah!

98
00:09:13.551 --> 00:09:15.303
Gabe! Gabe!

99
00:09:15.383 --> 00:09:17.345
No! No!

100
00:09:17.425 --> 00:09:18.886
- Gabe!
- Sarah, Hold on!

101
00:09:18.976 --> 00:09:20.017
- Sarah!
- Gabe!

102
00:09:20.638 --> 00:09:23.101
- Oh, please, I'm going to fall!
- No, you're not!

103
00:09:23.181 --> 00:09:24.982
You're OK. You're going to be OK!

104
00:09:25.062 --> 00:09:27.815
- Can you reach the main line?
- No, I can't!

105
00:09:27.895 --> 00:09:29.397
- Don't swing.
- God, I'm slipping!

106
00:09:29.567 --> 00:09:32.860
- Gabe, can you keep the line steady?
- That clip's not gonna hold!

107
00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.863
- I can't hold on, Gabe! Help me, please!
<i>- Gabe.</i>

108
00:09:35.943 --> 00:09:38.576
- You have to go after her.
- No!

109
00:09:38.656 --> 00:09:40.037
- Gabe, no!
- Hold on, Sarah.

110
00:09:40.117 --> 00:09:41.539
- I'm coming out to get you!
- No!

111
00:09:41.619 --> 00:09:43.331
It's not rigged for two people.

112
00:09:43.411 --> 00:09:45.373
Just keep it from swinging.
I'm gonna send out my harness.

113
00:09:45.503 --> 00:09:47.415
Forget the harness. There's no time!
I'm going for her!

114
00:09:47.505 --> 00:09:49.797
Gabe, shit! No!

115
00:09:50.628 --> 00:09:52.299
Sarah, I'm coming for you!

116
00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.301
I can't hold on! I'm slipping!

117
00:09:54.382 --> 00:09:57.134
Hold on just a little bit longer!
I'm coming for you!

118
00:09:57.214 --> 00:10:00.307
Gabe,
please hurry! I can't hold on!

119
00:10:00.518 --> 00:10:02.810
Sarah, don't look down.
Keep looking at me.

120
00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:05.312
- That's it. Hold it.
- I'm trying!

121
00:10:07.975 --> 00:10:09.476
It's breaking. She's losing it.

122
00:10:09.567 --> 00:10:13.731
- Sarah! He'll have you in a second, baby!
- No, I can't

123
00:10:13.821 --> 00:10:16.283
- Come on, baby! Don't you give up!
- No! No!

124
00:10:16.483 --> 00:10:17.985
Look at me, baby. Come on.

125
00:10:18.075 --> 00:10:19.907
- Please, Sarah!
- Hurry, Gabe. You're almost there.

126
00:10:19.987 --> 00:10:22.449
- You're almost there, Gabe. Keep going.
- I'm here, Sarah.

127
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:24.662
- Sarah, I'm here.
- Gabe!

128
00:10:25.663 --> 00:10:27.494
- I don't want to die!
- Sarah!

129
00:10:28.045 --> 00:10:30.838
Reach up and grab him! Reach up!

130
00:10:31.298 --> 00:10:33.460
- Sarah, reach up!
- Come on, honey!

131
00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:35.422
- Use your other hand! Reach up now.
- Reach up!

132
00:10:35.502 --> 00:10:38.756
Sarah, you've got to reach out!

133
00:10:40.808 --> 00:10:43.891
Hold on! Hold on!
I got you! I got you.

134
00:10:43.971 --> 00:10:46.814
- I can't hold on! I'm going to die!
- You are going to be all right.

135
00:10:46.894 --> 00:10:49.226
- No!
- You're not going to die.

136
00:10:51.268 --> 00:10:52.819
Don't you lose her, Gabe.

137
00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:54.982
I got her. Reach up.

138
00:10:55.272 --> 00:10:57.074
I'm slipping. I'm slipping!

139
00:10:58.695 --> 00:11:01.408
- You can do it, Sarah.
- Hold her, Gabe! Hold her.

140
00:11:01.488 --> 00:11:03.200
Gabe, please don't let me fall.

141
00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.492
Please, please, I don't want to die.

142
00:11:05.582 --> 00:11:07.534
- You're not gonna die.
- I'm slipping!

143
00:11:07.624 --> 00:11:09.786
Sarah, I got you!
Just reach up!

144
00:11:09.876 --> 00:11:11.918
I can't, Gabe!

145
00:11:11.998 --> 00:11:14.381
You can do it.
Please, baby, just reach up!

146
00:11:14.461 --> 00:11:17.294
- Reach up!
- Hal! Hal! I'm slipping!

147
00:11:17.384 --> 00:11:19.636
Gabe, man, don't you lose her!

148
00:11:19.716 --> 00:11:22.139
- Don't you let her go!
- Don't let me fall.

149
00:11:24.181 --> 00:11:26.473
I'm slipping!

150
00:11:27.053 --> 00:11:28.014
Sarah, please.

151
00:11:28.104 --> 00:11:30.056
No! No, I'm slipping! Gabe!

152
00:11:30.146 --> 00:11:32.058
Gabe, don't let me fall! No!

153
00:11:32.148 --> 00:11:35.442
- No!
- Help me! I'm falling! Gabe!

154
00:11:36.152 --> 00:11:38.024
No! Please!

155
00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:45.952
Gabe!

156
00:11:46.032 --> 00:11:48.785
No! Sarah, no!

157
00:11:48.875 --> 00:11:50.076
No!

158
00:11:58.795 --> 00:12:00.086
Jesus Christ.

159
00:12:21.157 --> 00:12:22.448
<i>...forty-four A.</i>

160
00:12:22.779 --> 00:12:26.282
<i>Treasury Agent,
Mac Lamoore, please contact D.A.U.</i>

161
00:12:36.752 --> 00:12:37.753
Lock 'em up.

162
00:12:39.796 --> 00:12:42.378
Travers, we'll be fuelled up
and ready to go in ten minutes.

163
00:12:42.468 --> 00:12:43.339
Very good.

164
00:12:51.267 --> 00:12:52.188
Mr. Travers.

165
00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:55.601
Thank you.

166
00:12:55.691 --> 00:12:56.983
- Hey, Rich.
- Morning, Walt.

167
00:12:57.063 --> 00:12:59.065
This is Agent Matheson, F.B.I.

168
00:12:59.145 --> 00:13:00.236
Mr. Travers.

169
00:13:00.606 --> 00:13:03.569
Matheson has been transferred
from the Denver office to Frisco.

170
00:13:03.649 --> 00:13:05.861
As a professional courtesy
between offices,

171
00:13:05.951 --> 00:13:07.703
I was asked if he could hitch a ride.

172
00:13:08.404 --> 00:13:10.286
Got plenty of room.
Be glad to accommodate you.

173
00:13:10.746 --> 00:13:12.368
- Appreciate it.
- You're the boss.

174
00:13:12.458 --> 00:13:15.040
Let's head out to the tarmac.
Matheson, have you been totally briefed?

175
00:13:15.541 --> 00:13:18.414
- I don't know about totally.
- Who the hell ever is?

176
00:13:18.504 --> 00:13:21.337
It's the most protected shipment
we've got and the most useless.

177
00:13:21.417 --> 00:13:23.048
These bills aren't even in circulation.

178
00:13:23.509 --> 00:13:26.632
$1,000 bills we're transporting are only
used for international banking exchange.

179
00:13:26.722 --> 00:13:28.424
You always transport through the air?

180
00:13:28.514 --> 00:13:31.136
Mostly. Armoured cars can be hijacked,
trains derailed...

181
00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:33.389
but nobody can touch us in flight.

182
00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:35.811
Haven't lost a bill in 12 years, Walt.
Don't jinx me now.

183
00:13:35.891 --> 00:13:38.684
I swear. Treasury agents
are the most superstitious people

184
00:13:38.774 --> 00:13:40.235
in the entire federal government.

185
00:13:40.316 --> 00:13:42.488
We should be.
Everybody wants what we have.

186
00:14:01.336 --> 00:14:03.338
Gabe! Hey, man, Gabe!

187
00:14:03.418 --> 00:14:05.671
- It's Gabe. He's back!
- I can see that, man.

188
00:14:05.801 --> 00:14:06.882
Hey, Gabe!

189
00:14:07.052 --> 00:14:08.263
Come on, man. Let's go!

190
00:14:19.855 --> 00:14:22.067
- Hey, Gabe!
- Gabe!

191
00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:25.731
Gabe!

192
00:14:30.075 --> 00:14:31.576
How you doing, Gabe?

193
00:14:31.656 --> 00:14:33.198
Dude, turn that down.

194
00:14:33.789 --> 00:14:36.331
You guys. How you doing, Brett, Evan?

195
00:14:36.411 --> 00:14:39.374
Hey, man, where you been?
You fall off the planet or something?

196
00:14:39.454 --> 00:14:41.456
No, I've been working up in Denver.

197
00:14:41.586 --> 00:14:42.707
- Work?
- Yeah!

198
00:14:42.797 --> 00:14:44.339
Don't say that word, man.

199
00:14:44.419 --> 00:14:47.052
Man, I hate work, even when
somebody else is doing it.

200
00:14:48.303 --> 00:14:50.425
Hey, Gabe, we're flying off
the tower today.

201
00:14:50.555 --> 00:14:51.756
You should come on with us.

202
00:14:51.846 --> 00:14:54.469
Yeah, man. Today's going to be
the day for a killer jump.

203
00:14:57.012 --> 00:14:59.314
- No, thanks. Can't.
- Come on, man.

204
00:14:59.394 --> 00:15:02.397
Don't tell me that job in Denver
made you scared of heights?

205
00:15:04.109 --> 00:15:04.979
No...

206
00:15:06.111 --> 00:15:09.824
Hey, look, you guys better watch out
'cause some bad weather's comin' in, OK?

207
00:15:09.904 --> 00:15:11.906
We like it extreme.

208
00:15:13.408 --> 00:15:16.621
Hey, man, see you later, Gabe.
Good to have you back.

209
00:15:16.741 --> 00:15:18.703
Yeah, good to see you. Later.

210
00:15:19.284 --> 00:15:20.415
Peace.

211
00:15:37.642 --> 00:15:38.973
How you doing, Jess?

212
00:15:45.149 --> 00:15:46.731
Hello, Gabriel.

213
00:15:49.694 --> 00:15:51.616
Got yourself a new horse?

214
00:15:54.318 --> 00:15:56.951
- Where have you been?
- Just working.

215
00:15:59.203 --> 00:16:01.375
After the funeral, I just had to leave.

216
00:16:01.996 --> 00:16:03.327
Had to leave?

217
00:16:05.209 --> 00:16:07.251
Believe me, a lot of us wanted to leave.

218
00:16:08.212 --> 00:16:11.135
But you know what? We stayed.

219
00:16:14.048 --> 00:16:15.219
Jess...

220
00:16:16.721 --> 00:16:18.843
a lot of things fell apart on that ledge.

221
00:16:18.973 --> 00:16:20.224
I know.

222
00:16:20.554 --> 00:16:22.436
But I don't think you know how much.

223
00:16:23.687 --> 00:16:26.100
Why can't you just believe
you did everything you could?

224
00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:28.853
Did I? I don't know.

225
00:16:29.103 --> 00:16:31.065
Maybe I shouldn't have
gone out on that line.

226
00:16:32.526 --> 00:16:35.659
Maybe I panicked. I don't know.

227
00:16:35.739 --> 00:16:37.821
I was there, remember?

228
00:16:37.912 --> 00:16:39.954
You were the only one who didn't panic.

229
00:16:40.204 --> 00:16:43.287
So, why don't you do us a favour
and quit hoarding all the guilt?

230
00:16:43.998 --> 00:16:47.962
You held on as long as you could.
And what about Hal?

231
00:16:48.042 --> 00:16:51.505
What was Hal doing on the tower
with a girl who could barely climb?

232
00:16:51.585 --> 00:16:54.378
Look, I can't blame Hal for anything,
Jessie, it was me.

233
00:16:55.969 --> 00:16:57.381
All me.

234
00:16:57.931 --> 00:16:59.513
Well, give it up, Gabe...

235
00:17:00.054 --> 00:17:02.556
because let me tell you something...
it doesn't get any better.

236
00:17:03.477 --> 00:17:04.888
It doesn't get any better?

237
00:17:05.349 --> 00:17:06.230
Mmm.

238
00:17:07.691 --> 00:17:09.523
I really don't think you understand.

239
00:17:10.564 --> 00:17:13.817
- What?
- I don't think you understand.

240
00:17:14.027 --> 00:17:15.609
I don't understand?

241
00:17:17.281 --> 00:17:19.953
I think I'm the only one that understands.

242
00:17:22.406 --> 00:17:25.659
Believe me, there were times when I
didn't know what I wanted to do more...

243
00:17:25.749 --> 00:17:28.372
hate you or love you.

244
00:17:29.583 --> 00:17:31.965
But one thing I did know
and I still do know...

245
00:17:32.626 --> 00:17:34.338
is I understand you.

246
00:17:47.981 --> 00:17:49.683
Did you come back to stay?

247
00:17:56.439 --> 00:17:58.031
You didn't.

248
00:18:01.284 --> 00:18:02.656
I can't.

249
00:18:04.037 --> 00:18:05.538
I can't. Not here.

250
00:18:07.871 --> 00:18:09.703
Jessie, I came back for you.

251
00:18:11.044 --> 00:18:14.087
And if you like,
I want you to come with me.

252
00:18:17.711 --> 00:18:20.633
You come back after being gone
for almost a year

253
00:18:20.714 --> 00:18:22.675
and you expect me to just leave?

254
00:18:24.888 --> 00:18:26.519
This is our home.

255
00:18:28.471 --> 00:18:29.933
Now it's my home.

256
00:18:30.683 --> 00:18:33.776
And I can't just pick up and go
for all the wrong reasons.

257
00:18:41.654 --> 00:18:42.535
Jessie...

258
00:18:43.786 --> 00:18:46.369
If you don't mind, I'd better
pick up the rest of my stuff.

259
00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:49.122
You know where everything is.

260
00:18:49.742 --> 00:18:50.913
I'm late for work.

261
00:19:07.009 --> 00:19:08.181
Hey, big boy.

262
00:19:19.982 --> 00:19:22.114
<i>Roger, Five-Lima,
scattered, broken clouds...</i>

263
00:19:22.194 --> 00:19:24.367
<i>20,000 feet with a severe storm advisory.</i>

264
00:19:25.077 --> 00:19:26.238
Check the storm scope.

265
00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:49.762
Travers says you're being transferred.

266
00:19:50.182 --> 00:19:51.894
Oh, yeah. Moving up in the world.

267
00:19:51.974 --> 00:19:52.855
Mmm.

268
00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:10.823
<i>The forecast...
cloudy skies with flurries today.</i>

269
00:20:10.913 --> 00:20:14.166
<i>We can expect an inch of snow
and a high in the low 30s.</i>

270
00:20:14.246 --> 00:20:18.170
<i>Overnight flurries will increase with
a total accumulation of three inches.</i>

271
00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:20.082
<i>Tonight's low near 15.</i>

272
00:20:20.172 --> 00:20:22.965
Hey, Jessie, you're just in time
for another masterpiece.

273
00:20:23.045 --> 00:20:24.136
Hiya, Jess.

274
00:20:24.216 --> 00:20:27.639
Oh, I think old Frank
nailed it with that stroke.

275
00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:29.721
What do you think?

276
00:20:30.012 --> 00:20:31.053
I don't know.

277
00:20:32.184 --> 00:20:33.345
What do you see?

278
00:20:34.186 --> 00:20:35.187
Surprise me.

279
00:20:35.557 --> 00:20:37.439
What usually eats a banana?

280
00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:39.851
A monkey.

281
00:20:39.942 --> 00:20:42.564
This is a picture of
a banana eating a monkey.

282
00:20:42.654 --> 00:20:45.027
- Nature in reverse.
- Where?

283
00:20:46.698 --> 00:20:47.819
Right here.

284
00:20:49.241 --> 00:20:53.165
Frank, you look like
a normal guy, but he's not...

285
00:20:53.825 --> 00:20:55.167
are you, Frankie?

286
00:20:55.247 --> 00:20:56.458
Hey, I'm an artist.

287
00:21:11.132 --> 00:21:11.973
We're being tracked.

288
00:21:12.053 --> 00:21:14.226
- We have a Jetstar, three o'clock.
- Travers!

289
00:21:14.596 --> 00:21:17.389
Stay put. Don't anyone
jump to conclusions.

290
00:21:22.984 --> 00:21:25.647
- He's coming in too slow.
- No, we're going too fast.

291
00:21:25.737 --> 00:21:28.700
We're too high. Give me 180 knots,
drop to 15,000 feet.

292
00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:29.651
You got it.

293
00:21:30.702 --> 00:21:34.616
Christ. We're losing altitude
and slowing down. Get your weapons.

294
00:21:34.706 --> 00:21:37.158
What the hell are you doing?
I have jurisdiction on this jet.

295
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.213
Now I have jurisdiction.
I said get your weapons!

296
00:21:42.714 --> 00:21:44.716
These are highly trained agents,
Mr. Matheson.

297
00:21:45.216 --> 00:21:49.170
I think you're overreacting.
Just calm down and give me the gun.

298
00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:50.512
You're out of control.

299
00:21:50.592 --> 00:21:52.093
What the hell are you waiting for,
goddamn it?

300
00:21:52.173 --> 00:21:54.135
Don't you see what he's doing?
He's hijacking the shipment.

301
00:22:14.786 --> 00:22:15.947
What the fuck was that?

302
00:22:29.921 --> 00:22:31.552
- Move into position.
<i>- Look alive, Kristel.</i>

303
00:22:31.632 --> 00:22:33.965
<i>Crossover transfer,
ten seconds and counting.</i>

304
00:22:34.175 --> 00:22:36.267
November one-two-niner-five Lima...

305
00:22:36.347 --> 00:22:38.809
this is Jetstar six-eight-zero
Tango-Tango.

306
00:22:38.889 --> 00:22:40.972
<i>Is frequency secure? Over.</i>

307
00:22:41.142 --> 00:22:44.025
<i>Roger, Tango-Tango.
This is Five-Lima. Go ahead.</i>

308
00:22:44.105 --> 00:22:45.686
<i>We have visual contact.</i>

309
00:22:45.776 --> 00:22:48.029
<i>What is your heading, speed and level?
Over.</i>

310
00:22:48.109 --> 00:22:51.322
<i>We're heading 0-8-0
and doing 2-5-0 knots level...</i>

311
00:22:51.402 --> 00:22:53.984
<i>at flight level 2-1-0-niner. Over.</i>

312
00:22:54.075 --> 00:22:55.986
<i>Five-Lima, we're opening up.</i>

313
00:22:56.077 --> 00:22:57.948
<i>Rise and shine, gentlemen.
Let's make history.</i>

314
00:22:58.369 --> 00:23:00.661
Roger, Five-Lima.
We'll begin closing.

315
00:23:00.741 --> 00:23:02.793
<i>Bring your speed back to 1-5-0.</i>

316
00:23:02.873 --> 00:23:07.548
<i>Commence descent to flight level 1-4-0
and turn right onto 2-6-0. Over.</i>

317
00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:13.674
<i>We're level. Flight level 1-4-0
and steady, 2-6-0 degrees.</i>

318
00:23:13.754 --> 00:23:15.676
<i>The weather ahead looks a bit threatening.</i>

319
00:23:15.756 --> 00:23:16.887
Roger.

320
00:23:17.097 --> 00:23:20.511
<i>- Travers, report your position.
- Ready to disengage tail cone.</i>

321
00:23:20.601 --> 00:23:21.472
<i>Stand by.</i>

322
00:23:29.019 --> 00:23:31.151
- Tail cone's clear.
- Roger.

323
00:23:47.377 --> 00:23:48.709
<i>Phase one complete.</i>

324
00:23:50.791 --> 00:23:52.382
<i>Tango-Tango,
prepare to receive cable.</i>

325
00:23:53.253 --> 00:23:55.095
<i>Tango-Tango standing by.</i>

326
00:23:55.295 --> 00:23:57.217
<i>Tango-Tango,
what's the turbulence back there?</i>

327
00:23:57.507 --> 00:23:59.009
<i>She's all over the place.</i>

328
00:23:59.099 --> 00:24:01.852
<i>This thing's got the response
of a 747 at this speed.</i>

329
00:24:02.222 --> 00:24:03.553
<i>Sounds like fun.</i>

330
00:24:03.643 --> 00:24:05.936
<i>We're streaming the drogue down.
We'll see you in a minute.</i>

331
00:24:06.016 --> 00:24:08.438
<i>Welcoming party's ready.
Good luck.</i>

332
00:24:08.518 --> 00:24:11.772
<i>We're moving in to pick up the drogue now.
Tango-Tango out.</i>

333
00:24:18.658 --> 00:24:20.280
I've got it. Stand by, Kristel.

334
00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:21.872
<i>Standing by.</i>

335
00:24:24.624 --> 00:24:25.825
We're locked on.

336
00:24:26.877 --> 00:24:28.248
Into the transfer position.

337
00:24:28.919 --> 00:24:29.789
Check.

338
00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:31.881
Moving into transfer position.

339
00:24:32.672 --> 00:24:35.215
We're closing to 1-4-0 feet.

340
00:24:35.295 --> 00:24:38.428
<i>We're closing.
We'll report when in position.</i>

341
00:24:41.931 --> 00:24:44.844
- Travers, We're too close to the storm.
- Don't lose your nerve.

342
00:24:45.305 --> 00:24:47.767
All they'll find is a plane
that went down in the storm.

343
00:24:48.518 --> 00:24:50.940
- Hurry up, Travers.
<i>- On my way.</i>

344
00:24:51.311 --> 00:24:53.193
The cases are hooked up and ready.

345
00:24:55.815 --> 00:24:59.529
Charge goes off in five minutes.
Stick to the plan and you're rich.

346
00:24:59.609 --> 00:25:00.570
Got it.

347
00:25:01.781 --> 00:25:03.493
<i>Tango-Tango in position.</i>

348
00:25:04.574 --> 00:25:06.706
- What's taking so long?
- Patience.

349
00:25:09.829 --> 00:25:12.041
Tango-Tango, dip the plane.
I'm coming over.

350
00:25:12.121 --> 00:25:15.004
<i>Wilco, Five-Lima.
Tango-Tango standing by</i>

351
00:25:15.084 --> 00:25:18.378
<i>at flight level 1-4-0
and steady 2-6-0 degrees.</i>

352
00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:23.132
Five-Lima, I'm out of here.

353
00:25:23.222 --> 00:25:24.093
Roger.

354
00:25:28.848 --> 00:25:30.640
<i>What the hell is he doing?</i>

355
00:25:32.311 --> 00:25:34.143
<i>Five-Lima, where are the cases?</i>

356
00:25:43.653 --> 00:25:45.745
- Kristel, we've got him.
<i>- Roger.</i>

357
00:25:45.825 --> 00:25:47.577
Why didn't you send the money first?

358
00:25:48.207 --> 00:25:51.160
Somehow, I didn't think
you'd wait for me if I sent it first.

359
00:26:13.182 --> 00:26:14.733
We're approaching
the storm fast.

360
00:26:14.814 --> 00:26:16.145
I can't hold this course much longer.

361
00:26:16.235 --> 00:26:19.318
- <i>Niner-zero seconds.</i>
- What's keeping him?

362
00:26:20.439 --> 00:26:22.321
Let's move your ass up there.

363
00:26:24.073 --> 00:26:26.115
I'm at the cases. Stand by.

364
00:26:26.365 --> 00:26:27.907
Tango-Tango standing by.

365
00:26:28.497 --> 00:26:29.748
You fuck.

366
00:26:37.876 --> 00:26:39.458
<i>We've lost the pilot.</i>

367
00:26:39.548 --> 00:26:41.300
<i>- Who did you leave up there?
- No one.</i>

368
00:26:46.715 --> 00:26:49.718
Get underneath the jet.
The cases will slide over.

369
00:26:55.354 --> 00:26:57.105
<i>Who the fuck
is the surprise guest?</i>

370
00:27:07.616 --> 00:27:09.368
Just get those cases.

371
00:27:10.619 --> 00:27:12.581
He's hurt bad. What should we do with him?

372
00:27:12.661 --> 00:27:14.873
Get him to a hospital, fast.

373
00:27:20.298 --> 00:27:23.091
- We're not levelling out.
- One-zero seconds.

374
00:27:23.171 --> 00:27:25.384
- I've lost hydraulics!
<i>- We're going to be fine.</i>

375
00:27:41.189 --> 00:27:42.901
The cable's blown free.

376
00:27:43.191 --> 00:27:45.273
Don't unhook it.
The cases are still there.

377
00:27:45.774 --> 00:27:47.986
- Don't lose the money, goddamn it!
- Hold it.

378
00:27:48.827 --> 00:27:50.488
- Pull the cable!
- We gotta pull!

379
00:27:50.578 --> 00:27:52.330
- Bypass switch one.
- Check.

380
00:27:52.831 --> 00:27:54.873
<i>- Bypass switch two.
- Keep pulling.</i>

381
00:27:54.953 --> 00:27:56.875
- <i>Nothing.</i>
- OK. Switch to manual.

382
00:27:56.955 --> 00:27:58.837
Hold the fuckin ' plane steady!

383
00:27:58.917 --> 00:28:02.420
- Pull! Come on!
- Travers, don't fuck it up!

384
00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:04.793
- How's number one engine?
- Oil pressure falling.

385
00:28:05.253 --> 00:28:07.756
- Come on. Don't lose the money.
- They're coming.

386
00:28:08.506 --> 00:28:10.138
Oh! Goddamn it! Shit!

387
00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:14.142
- We've lost it.
- Oh, fuck!

388
00:28:16.224 --> 00:28:17.145
Release the cable.

389
00:28:21.399 --> 00:28:22.610
Close it up.

390
00:28:26.194 --> 00:28:28.696
So this is your idea
of a foolproof plan?

391
00:28:29.197 --> 00:28:32.490
<i>You stupid bastard.
Kristel, what's the report?</i>

392
00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:35.413
The hydraulics aren't functioning.
He shot off the hydraulics.

393
00:28:35.533 --> 00:28:37.075
We gotta fire warning light
number four.

394
00:28:37.205 --> 00:28:39.417
I'm losing altitude.
We're gonna go down!

395
00:28:39.497 --> 00:28:41.919
Dump the fuel. You'll have to
pick your way through the peaks.

396
00:28:41.999 --> 00:28:44.252
Close the fuel valve
and shut off all fuel pumps!

397
00:28:46.174 --> 00:28:49.587
Don't bother to buckle up.
You may not want to survive this.

398
00:28:50.338 --> 00:28:52.800
Flaps to 25 degrees
before we lose all power.

399
00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:54.432
Flaps, 25 degrees.

400
00:28:54.512 --> 00:28:57.845
Reduce power 60%.
Shut down all generators and the motors.

401
00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.562
Lower flaps. You may have
to hand-crank them down.

402
00:29:12.199 --> 00:29:13.361
You want the gear down?

403
00:29:13.451 --> 00:29:15.743
Leave the gear up.
Shut down all power.

404
00:29:15.823 --> 00:29:16.864
Check.

405
00:29:16.954 --> 00:29:18.245
Give me a hand with the controls.

406
00:30:04.161 --> 00:30:06.083
Wow! Did you catch that thunder?

407
00:30:06.163 --> 00:30:08.755
That was too loud for thunder, man.
Come on. Let's rock and roll.

408
00:30:08.836 --> 00:30:11.628
One, two, three!

409
00:30:15.802 --> 00:30:17.764
- I'm free!
- Radical, man.

410
00:30:17.844 --> 00:30:20.677
Man, look at me. Watch this. Yeah.

411
00:30:31.398 --> 00:30:32.819
Mike?

412
00:30:34.821 --> 00:30:35.902
Mike?

413
00:30:37.284 --> 00:30:38.445
Shit.

414
00:30:45.412 --> 00:30:47.374
You thought of everything, didn't you?

415
00:30:47.544 --> 00:30:49.456
Everything except what's happening now.

416
00:30:50.917 --> 00:30:53.920
Kill the pig!
Your fucking plan almost killed us!

417
00:30:55.011 --> 00:30:56.963
Kill the pig, my ass.

418
00:30:57.844 --> 00:30:59.015
We're partners in this.

419
00:30:59.175 --> 00:31:00.307
Were.

420
00:31:01.638 --> 00:31:03.219
Give me the tracking monitor.

421
00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:05.522
What the hell are you gonna do with it?

422
00:31:05.812 --> 00:31:07.394
Don't make him ask twice.

423
00:31:07.474 --> 00:31:08.855
Give it to him.

424
00:31:10.276 --> 00:31:13.570
You want it? Take it.

425
00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:15.862
It's only got 50,000 code variations.

426
00:31:15.942 --> 00:31:18.234
I'll break your fucking neck in a minute!

427
00:31:18.324 --> 00:31:20.577
- Go ahead. Break my fucking neck!
- Sit down.

428
00:31:22.118 --> 00:31:24.240
In case you slept through the landing...

429
00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:26.993
you'll need all the money you can find
to buy your way out of this country.

430
00:31:27.243 --> 00:31:29.455
You know it, and I know it.

431
00:31:29.546 --> 00:31:31.998
How do we get off the mountain,
even if we find it?

432
00:31:34.921 --> 00:31:36.052
Kristel.

433
00:31:39.926 --> 00:31:41.718
I think we found a frequency.

434
00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:45.762
<i>Somebody help, please.</i>

435
00:31:45.852 --> 00:31:48.604
<i>Is there somebody there?
Somebody please help.</i>

436
00:31:48.685 --> 00:31:50.066
Rocky Mountain Rescue. Come in.

437
00:31:51.567 --> 00:31:52.899
Rocky Mountain Rescue. Come in.

438
00:31:53.109 --> 00:31:54.570
<i>Oh, thank God!</i>

439
00:31:55.111 --> 00:31:58.905
<i>Ah, we're stranded.
We were hiking and lost our bearings.</i>

440
00:31:59.075 --> 00:32:01.327
We didn't expect
the weather to come in this fast.

441
00:32:01.407 --> 00:32:04.951
OK. Just take it easy. Take it easy.
How many people in your party? Over.

442
00:32:07.914 --> 00:32:10.917
Five people. I don't know where we are.

443
00:32:12.168 --> 00:32:16.883
<i>I... I see only a cylinder-type
rock formation. Over.</i>

444
00:32:16.963 --> 00:32:18.634
It's got to be Comb Bluff.

445
00:32:18.714 --> 00:32:20.886
Winds are too strong
to get a chopper up there.

446
00:32:20.967 --> 00:32:22.048
Try to stay calm.

447
00:32:22.138 --> 00:32:24.300
<i>We're on our way.
You're gonna be all right.</i>

448
00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:27.143
Please hurry. Billy's going into shock.

449
00:32:27.683 --> 00:32:29.765
Please, we need insulin.

450
00:32:29.855 --> 00:32:32.438
Please, hurry.

451
00:32:35.231 --> 00:32:36.652
"We need insulin."

452
00:32:39.945 --> 00:32:41.487
Would you have thought of that?

453
00:32:54.670 --> 00:32:56.582
- Thank God you didn't leave.
- Why?

454
00:32:56.672 --> 00:32:59.255
We just got an emergency call.
Five climbers are stranded off Comb Bluff.

455
00:32:59.335 --> 00:33:01.637
The weather's pouring in,
and Hal's gone up alone.

456
00:33:02.588 --> 00:33:04.680
- Hal's a good climber.
- What?

457
00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:06.432
What's that supposed to mean?

458
00:33:07.222 --> 00:33:08.934
It means he can handle it himself.

459
00:33:11.687 --> 00:33:13.439
It he gets up there
and socked in by the weather,

460
00:33:13.519 --> 00:33:14.690
they'll never make it down.

461
00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:17.983
Gabe, he needs someone
who has emergency medical training...

462
00:33:18.063 --> 00:33:20.105
and knows every handle to those peaks.

463
00:33:20.195 --> 00:33:23.779
I'm the last one he wants help from,
and that's not what I came back here for.

464
00:33:23.949 --> 00:33:26.492
Our problems are not the issue right now.
Those people are.

465
00:33:26.572 --> 00:33:28.534
What it he can't do it alone?

466
00:33:29.575 --> 00:33:32.578
Look, Jessie, I haven't climbed in months.

467
00:33:32.668 --> 00:33:34.289
You just lose the feel.

468
00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:36.872
Maybe you mean the nerve.

469
00:33:43.679 --> 00:33:45.220
I didn't mean that.

470
00:33:48.684 --> 00:33:49.634
It's OK.

471
00:33:50.686 --> 00:33:53.939
Gabe, I know you don't want to be
responsible for anybody's life anymore...

472
00:33:54.019 --> 00:33:56.601
but I'm talking about somebody
that was your best friend.

473
00:33:57.022 --> 00:33:58.944
Please, Gabe, he took the west ridge.

474
00:33:59.024 --> 00:34:01.526
It you take the north face,
you can beat him. No problem.

475
00:34:03.698 --> 00:34:06.701
What has happened to you?
Don't you feel anything anymore?

476
00:34:06.781 --> 00:34:08.243
Feel anything?

477
00:34:09.114 --> 00:34:10.575
Jessie, I came back for you.

478
00:34:10.956 --> 00:34:12.457
I'm not talking about me.

479
00:34:12.867 --> 00:34:14.459
I'm talking about you.

480
00:34:17.212 --> 00:34:19.044
Go ahead... leave.

481
00:34:19.544 --> 00:34:20.415
But if you don't do this now,

482
00:34:20.505 --> 00:34:22.968
you're gonna be stuck on that ledge
for the rest of your life.

483
00:34:48.783 --> 00:34:50.615
Where the hell is that goddamn plane?

484
00:34:51.115 --> 00:34:52.997
Looks like she went down in the storm.

485
00:34:53.748 --> 00:34:57.121
Now, that storm front is still building,
so even it we could send up a search plane

486
00:34:57.201 --> 00:34:59.294
it would be impossible
to see anything on the ground.

487
00:35:00.004 --> 00:35:02.757
- What about roads?
- There aren't any roads up there.

488
00:35:04.008 --> 00:35:05.259
Mr. Wright.

489
00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:08.383
Mr. Wright. These two FBI agents
were insisting on seeing you.

490
00:35:08.553 --> 00:35:10.304
Mr. Wright, I'm Agent Hayes.
This is Agent Michaels.

491
00:35:10.385 --> 00:35:12.717
Look, If you're concerned about your agent
who was along for the ride,

492
00:35:12.807 --> 00:35:14.018
I've got nothing to tell you.

493
00:35:16.431 --> 00:35:19.524
Matheson wasn't along for the ride.
He was working surveillance.

494
00:35:19.644 --> 00:35:21.315
Surveillance? Of what?

495
00:35:21.976 --> 00:35:23.898
The Bureau have been
getting sketchy reports

496
00:35:23.978 --> 00:35:26.731
that Treasury jets were being monitored
between Denver and San Francisco.

497
00:35:26.821 --> 00:35:28.282
Now, we didn't wanna tell your department

498
00:35:28.362 --> 00:35:29.694
because we thought
it might be an inside job.

499
00:35:30.074 --> 00:35:33.157
That's impossible.
You're suggesting a hijacking?

500
00:35:33.537 --> 00:35:36.951
Hell no. Not only did I have
my best men on that flight...

501
00:35:37.121 --> 00:35:39.293
but each one of those cases
were monitored.

502
00:35:39.543 --> 00:35:42.376
And the money
is in unexchangeable denominations.

503
00:35:42.456 --> 00:35:45.549
I tell you, man, it would be useless
for anybody to try to steal it.

504
00:35:45.629 --> 00:35:47.341
Yeah, except for this man.

505
00:35:47.421 --> 00:35:49.804
- Who the hell is this?
- Name is Eric Qualen.

506
00:35:49.924 --> 00:35:52.466
We've been tracking him for sometime now
without much success.

507
00:35:52.927 --> 00:35:54.718
He's a former member
of military intelligence...

508
00:35:54.809 --> 00:35:57.391
who's found it more profitable
going to the other side.

509
00:35:57.471 --> 00:36:00.815
Industrial espionage.
Hijacking diamonds from South Africa.

510
00:36:00.895 --> 00:36:03.858
Theft and disposal of millions
in negotiable bearer bonds.

511
00:36:03.938 --> 00:36:05.189
You name it.

512
00:36:05.479 --> 00:36:08.402
He has the international connections
to move this currency, Mr. Wright,

513
00:36:08.482 --> 00:36:12.406
and $100 million offers one hell
of a temptation to this psychotic.

514
00:36:12.866 --> 00:36:14.658
Jesus Christ.

515
00:36:42.856 --> 00:36:44.978
What the hell are you doing up here, man?

516
00:36:45.359 --> 00:36:47.611
I was talking to Jessie. She filled me in.

517
00:36:47.691 --> 00:36:48.562
Did she?

518
00:36:49.483 --> 00:36:51.445
Well, now let me fill you in.

519
00:36:51.775 --> 00:36:53.487
As far as I am concerned,

520
00:36:53.567 --> 00:36:56.910
you can take your ass down and go back
to that hole you've been hiding in.

521
00:36:58.452 --> 00:37:00.744
Once we get these people down,
I'm gone, Hal.

522
00:37:01.575 --> 00:37:04.167
No. You're out of here now.

523
00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:09.252
Why the hell did you come up here?
To prove something?

524
00:37:10.794 --> 00:37:12.796
Look, I know how you
feel about me, all right.

525
00:37:12.886 --> 00:37:14.087
You don't know anything!

526
00:37:15.639 --> 00:37:17.390
You did it your way...

527
00:37:18.301 --> 00:37:19.262
and she died.

528
00:37:28.772 --> 00:37:31.605
- I did what I thought was right.
- Well, you were wrong.

529
00:37:31.695 --> 00:37:33.947
It was your weight on the line
that did it.

530
00:37:34.027 --> 00:37:36.029
There wasn't time for anything else, Hal.

531
00:37:36.109 --> 00:37:38.531
Oh... well, I guess
we'll never know, will we?

532
00:37:38.611 --> 00:37:40.744
Look, Hal,
it was a bad time for everybody.

533
00:37:40.824 --> 00:37:43.456
What the hell
do you know about bad times, man?

534
00:37:43.536 --> 00:37:46.830
You didn't love her, and you didn't
have to explain to her family.

535
00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:49.332
And you didn't have to look
into her eyes when she was falling!

536
00:37:49.542 --> 00:37:52.755
- Now drop it!
- No, buddy!

537
00:37:55.678 --> 00:37:58.221
It was you who dropped it.

538
00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:08.891
You want to do it?

539
00:38:09.562 --> 00:38:10.693
Do it.

540
00:38:12.105 --> 00:38:13.316
No...

541
00:38:16.529 --> 00:38:17.570
You live with it.

542
00:38:49.812 --> 00:38:50.983
They're here.

543
00:38:52.024 --> 00:38:53.275
<i>Right on time.</i>

544
00:38:53.986 --> 00:38:55.818
How many of them are there?

545
00:38:56.939 --> 00:39:00.743
We got two heroes.
We'll greet 'em at the top.

546
00:39:08.451 --> 00:39:10.503
- Where's the helicopter?
- What the hell's going on?

547
00:39:15.417 --> 00:39:18.921
- Where's the helicopter?
- It can't fly in this weather.

548
00:39:19.011 --> 00:39:21.213
- Is either of you a chopper pilot?
- No.

549
00:39:22.675 --> 00:39:23.886
What are your names?

550
00:39:24.767 --> 00:39:25.968
Tucker and Walker.

551
00:39:26.098 --> 00:39:28.270
Well, Tucker and Walker,
we're missing three bags.

552
00:39:29.101 --> 00:39:29.932
What's in them?

553
00:39:30.022 --> 00:39:31.393
None of your fucking business!

554
00:39:32.144 --> 00:39:35.818
Suits, socks, $100 million,
the usual stuff.

555
00:39:36.568 --> 00:39:39.441
Travers here was smart enough
to bring along a tracking device.

556
00:39:39.902 --> 00:39:41.653
Don't use my name, goddamn it.

557
00:39:50.913 --> 00:39:51.954
Key it.

558
00:39:53.996 --> 00:39:57.209
Look at the map. This is where
we've lost our belongings.

559
00:39:57.589 --> 00:40:00.342
The red dots on the monitor
are the three cases.

560
00:40:00.422 --> 00:40:02.594
You recognize these locations?

561
00:40:06.428 --> 00:40:07.809
Let me jar your memory.

562
00:40:07.930 --> 00:40:09.761
It you don't recognize them,
you're useless.

563
00:40:09.851 --> 00:40:12.104
Useless items are usually discarded.

564
00:40:13.105 --> 00:40:16.188
- Right, Travers?
- Get off my back, Qualen.

565
00:40:16.978 --> 00:40:18.480
Off?

566
00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:21.022
I haven't even got on it, yet.

567
00:40:22.114 --> 00:40:26.238
Once again,
do you recognize these locations?

568
00:40:32.704 --> 00:40:33.705
Ryan.

569
00:40:41.753 --> 00:40:43.545
Yeah. We do.

570
00:40:44.175 --> 00:40:45.347
Then let's go.

571
00:40:50.892 --> 00:40:52.724
Wait a minute, asshole!

572
00:40:57.058 --> 00:40:58.229
Where is it?

573
00:41:04.365 --> 00:41:05.527
Up there.

574
00:41:08.239 --> 00:41:10.492
<i>Rescue one,
this is Rescue Center.</i>

575
00:41:10.572 --> 00:41:11.993
<i>Hal? Come in, Hal.</i>

576
00:41:12.073 --> 00:41:14.916
<i>- Over.</i>
- Nice. You're Hal?

577
00:41:16.828 --> 00:41:18.920
You, stay. You!

578
00:41:21.793 --> 00:41:22.674
Fetch.

579
00:41:30.391 --> 00:41:31.643
Fetch!

580
00:41:33.054 --> 00:41:34.345
Do it.

581
00:41:40.691 --> 00:41:42.904
<i>Rescue one,
this is Rescue Center.</i>

582
00:41:42.984 --> 00:41:44.315
<i>Do you copy?</i>

583
00:41:45.276 --> 00:41:48.950
Hal, come in. Hal, come in. Over.

584
00:41:58.459 --> 00:42:01.422
Watch yourself under the overhang.
It could deliver anytime.

585
00:42:02.083 --> 00:42:05.176
Anytime you feel like
saying something, don't.

586
00:42:05.836 --> 00:42:07.508
We're waiting, gentlemen.

587
00:42:08.009 --> 00:42:10.091
- I need my bolt gun and ice axe.
- No.

588
00:42:10.261 --> 00:42:13.344
- Don't give him anything.
- Take his coat for insurance.

589
00:42:14.305 --> 00:42:15.596
He could freeze to death!

590
00:42:16.727 --> 00:42:19.190
You've got your own problems, Hal.

591
00:42:22.603 --> 00:42:26.147
Ryan, get a rope.
I want this dog on a leash too.

592
00:42:30.151 --> 00:42:32.453
Tie it. It better hold.

593
00:42:41.912 --> 00:42:44.214
Forget me. If you can, get away.

594
00:42:44.795 --> 00:42:45.836
Would you?

595
00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:51.422
Go fetch, wonder dog.

596
00:43:13.864 --> 00:43:15.405
Move it, Walker.

597
00:43:19.199 --> 00:43:22.502
Keep it taut. Ryan, keep it taut!

598
00:43:25.585 --> 00:43:28.669
Hal, come in please.
Hal, come in please. Over.

599
00:43:54.404 --> 00:43:56.036
I don't trust him.

600
00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:31.481
Damn.

601
00:44:37.987 --> 00:44:40.280
I don't think we need two guides.

602
00:44:41.621 --> 00:44:43.913
Retire him when he comes down.

603
00:44:44.624 --> 00:44:47.497
They're going to kill you!
Don't come down! Don't come down!

604
00:44:47.917 --> 00:44:49.709
Pull the rope. Pull the rope!

605
00:44:52.251 --> 00:44:54.674
Pull, goddamn it! Pull!

606
00:45:00.099 --> 00:45:01.891
- Come on! Pull!
- Pull it!

607
00:45:05.975 --> 00:45:07.226
Pull, goddamn it!

608
00:45:07.436 --> 00:45:09.018
Ow!

609
00:45:25.745 --> 00:45:26.956
Watch it!

610
00:45:28.828 --> 00:45:30.459
- Get him!
- No!

611
00:45:30.539 --> 00:45:31.420
Do it.

612
00:46:52.961 --> 00:46:56.334
Your friend just had
the most expensive funeral in history.

613
00:46:56.414 --> 00:46:57.916
Now it's only you.

614
00:46:58.717 --> 00:47:01.219
<i>Come in, Rescue Unit.
Rescue Unit, come in.</i>

615
00:47:01.299 --> 00:47:03.421
Hal, what's going on? Hal?

616
00:47:03.512 --> 00:47:04.382
Hal?

617
00:47:05.173 --> 00:47:06.094
Talk.

618
00:47:06.595 --> 00:47:09.097
No messages, no codes, no tricks.

619
00:47:09.177 --> 00:47:11.850
You haven't found us. It was a fake call.

620
00:47:13.391 --> 00:47:15.523
Jessie, I've just reached
the top of the tower.

621
00:47:15.604 --> 00:47:17.896
<i>So far, there's no sign of anyone.</i>

622
00:47:17.986 --> 00:47:20.398
<i>Looks like a phony call. Over.</i>

623
00:47:20.488 --> 00:47:24.532
You've got to be kidding me.
Do you want me to fly up after you? Over.

624
00:47:24.612 --> 00:47:27.035
No. Negative.
The winds are still too high.

625
00:47:27.115 --> 00:47:29.407
I'm going to ride out the storm up here.

626
00:47:29.497 --> 00:47:31.870
We'll take shelter at the old Doug...

627
00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:34.292
Hal, I'm losing you. Hal. Come in.

628
00:47:34.372 --> 00:47:36.004
<i>Come in, Hal. Over.</i>

629
00:47:36.544 --> 00:47:38.376
Go on to the next case.

630
00:47:42.670 --> 00:47:45.013
He said the tower, but he's on Comb Bluff.

631
00:47:45.964 --> 00:47:49.217
Frank, fly me to the west valley.
The winds are never too strong there.

632
00:47:49.307 --> 00:47:51.389
It's only a half-hour climb
to the Douglas Shaft.

633
00:47:51.469 --> 00:47:53.811
It's the only shelter for miles around.
Hal would have to go there.

634
00:47:53.972 --> 00:47:57.605
- Jessie, that is a bad idea.
- Please, Frank.

635
00:47:57.895 --> 00:48:00.898
Look, if I don't find him,
you can come pick me up by nightfall.

636
00:48:00.979 --> 00:48:03.031
Hal would have my head.

637
00:48:03.111 --> 00:48:04.942
And it's such a handsome head.

638
00:48:08.116 --> 00:48:09.617
Please, Frank.

639
00:48:10.698 --> 00:48:12.490
I'll buy one of your paintings.

640
00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:23.671
Hold up!

641
00:48:26.714 --> 00:48:28.095
Where is it?

642
00:48:35.012 --> 00:48:37.315
There. On top of the peak.

643
00:48:37.685 --> 00:48:39.186
- Come on.
- Hold it.

644
00:48:41.729 --> 00:48:43.401
Looks like a winding route to me.

645
00:48:45.403 --> 00:48:47.985
The fastest way is
straight up the east face.

646
00:48:48.656 --> 00:48:51.699
Of course, there are only 12 guys
in the world who could do it.

647
00:48:52.079 --> 00:48:53.410
You want to try it?

648
00:50:38.224 --> 00:50:40.847
Gabe. What's happened?
What's happened?

649
00:50:40.937 --> 00:50:43.810
Oh, my God. You're frozen. Come sit down.

650
00:50:43.890 --> 00:50:45.942
Gabe, where's your pack,
where's your sweater?

651
00:50:46.022 --> 00:50:48.895
- Talk to me, Gabe. What happened?
- They got Hal.

652
00:50:49.486 --> 00:50:52.108
The distress call was a fake.

653
00:50:53.650 --> 00:50:55.652
Fake? What do you mean it was fake?

654
00:50:56.282 --> 00:51:00.036
Before they crashed,
they dumped cases of money.

655
00:51:00.116 --> 00:51:02.118
- They? Who's they?
- I don't know.

656
00:51:02.208 --> 00:51:05.541
They're using Hal to find it.
When they do, he's dead.

657
00:51:05.662 --> 00:51:08.504
Jess, you gotta get on the radio
and call Frank...

658
00:51:08.965 --> 00:51:12.218
and tell him to call the state police.

659
00:51:12.548 --> 00:51:14.671
The cold killed my radio,
but Frank's gonna be looking for me.

660
00:51:14.761 --> 00:51:18.174
- We'll contact everybody from the chopper.
- The sun goes down in an hour.

661
00:51:18.675 --> 00:51:20.176
What do you want me to do?

662
00:51:21.267 --> 00:51:23.679
Let's take everything we need. Let's move.

663
00:51:23.770 --> 00:51:25.561
We got to get to
that next case before they do.

664
00:51:31.858 --> 00:51:33.149
We're close!

665
00:51:33.239 --> 00:51:35.491
- It's just up there!
- It better be.

666
00:51:37.323 --> 00:51:40.786
You know something? I'm getting
real fucking tired of your threats.

667
00:51:41.247 --> 00:51:42.288
Are you?

668
00:52:20.115 --> 00:52:21.237
It's there.

669
00:52:34.299 --> 00:52:36.592
Oh, my God. What do we do now?

670
00:52:37.503 --> 00:52:38.924
You got a pencil?

671
00:53:22.007 --> 00:53:23.178
Over here.

672
00:53:45.570 --> 00:53:46.701
Goddamn.

673
00:53:48.873 --> 00:53:51.126
The son of a bitch is still alive!

674
00:53:57.632 --> 00:54:00.044
I'm beginning to dislike this Mr. Walker.

675
00:54:02.387 --> 00:54:04.799
He can't be far. Find him. Go.

676
00:54:27.111 --> 00:54:28.323
Go.

677
00:55:09.153 --> 00:55:10.074
Come on.

678
00:55:24.718 --> 00:55:25.970
Give me a flare.

679
00:55:27.761 --> 00:55:29.383
- Meet me at Eagle's Cape.
- I'm not leaving.

680
00:55:29.473 --> 00:55:30.424
Jessie, don't worry about me!

681
00:56:52.385 --> 00:56:53.807
Gravity's a bitch, isn't it?

682
00:56:53.887 --> 00:56:55.929
Fuck the money, and fuck you!

683
00:56:56.259 --> 00:56:58.561
I wasn't born to die
on a fucking mountain.

684
00:56:58.892 --> 00:57:01.064
Where were you born to die?
Got a place picked out?

685
00:57:01.144 --> 00:57:03.857
I don't need to hear that fucking shit
from you, boy. Come on...

686
00:57:03.977 --> 00:57:06.569
Maybe this boy should make
this big mouth a little bigger.

687
00:57:06.649 --> 00:57:07.901
Stop this!

688
00:57:08.982 --> 00:57:11.574
The fight's not here. It's out there.

689
00:57:15.829 --> 00:57:17.370
Find us some shelter.

690
00:57:26.539 --> 00:57:28.882
Next time you're, like,
watching MTV, you know...

691
00:57:29.292 --> 00:57:32.255
take a split second
and flip it to the Weather Channel.

692
00:57:32.345 --> 00:57:35.298
I mean, hey, where would you
rather be right now?

693
00:57:35.348 --> 00:57:38.431
Here in tent city, or at home
playing some righteous air hockey?

694
00:57:38.801 --> 00:57:40.683
Air hockey's definitely got my vote.

695
00:57:40.763 --> 00:57:42.805
Exactly, cheesehead, exactly.

696
00:57:43.856 --> 00:57:45.688
- Cheesehead?
- Cheesehead.

697
00:57:50.903 --> 00:57:53.366
- He was here.
- What was in there?

698
00:57:53.486 --> 00:57:54.987
Answer the man.

699
00:57:55.698 --> 00:57:58.571
- Nothing. Just tourist souvenirs.
- Or equipment.

700
00:57:59.202 --> 00:58:01.874
Maybe Walker plans
to look after his friend here.

701
00:58:02.415 --> 00:58:03.826
He's not my friend...

702
00:58:03.996 --> 00:58:07.079
and I don't like him
any more than I do you.

703
00:58:07.710 --> 00:58:08.961
Nice try.

704
00:58:09.752 --> 00:58:13.336
But I never underestimate the power
of loyalty when it comes naturally.

705
00:58:14.427 --> 00:58:17.139
Not like the kind that has to be paid for.

706
00:58:19.011 --> 00:58:20.092
Make a fire.

707
00:58:23.766 --> 00:58:25.728
It costs a fortune to heat this place.

708
00:58:28.691 --> 00:58:30.443
That's bad humour, I know.

709
00:58:38.661 --> 00:58:41.664
We better get some sleep.
We're gonna need it.

710
00:58:55.467 --> 00:58:57.089
Rescue units, come in.

711
00:58:57.680 --> 00:59:00.803
Again, do you read? Come in.

712
00:59:01.473 --> 00:59:03.635
<i>What the hell is going on up there?</i>

713
00:59:04.056 --> 00:59:05.017
<i>Hal.</i>

714
00:59:05.517 --> 00:59:07.309
<i>Jessie, do you read?</i>

715
00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:12.064
Jessie. It looks
as if we're drawing a crowd.

716
00:59:12.194 --> 00:59:15.067
We're down to a few hours before
the whole fucking world shows up.

717
00:59:15.277 --> 00:59:17.149
- Where's the next one?
- It's on the tower.

718
00:59:17.239 --> 00:59:18.400
How far?

719
00:59:19.992 --> 00:59:22.204
He asked how far, goddamn it!

720
00:59:22.905 --> 00:59:26.368
You know what I think? I think
you've been taking the scenic route.

721
00:59:27.209 --> 00:59:28.710
Now, how far is it?

722
00:59:29.251 --> 00:59:30.832
Half a day.

723
00:59:31.503 --> 00:59:33.045
It's half a day.

724
00:59:33.255 --> 00:59:38.300
Hey, Hal! Hal! Check it out, man.
It's Hal. Hey, man, you stuck up here too?

725
00:59:39.261 --> 00:59:41.263
- You missed a great jump yesterday.
- Walk over.

726
00:59:41.343 --> 00:59:44.016
For Christ's sakes, man,
they're just kids.

727
00:59:44.176 --> 00:59:46.978
- Why don't you let them go?
- We're not animals.

728
00:59:47.099 --> 00:59:50.232
Don't force us to be. Walk over.

729
00:59:51.233 --> 00:59:54.146
Hey, man, was that storm
a real bummer or what?

730
00:59:54.526 --> 00:59:56.398
Me and him were in tent city last night.

731
00:59:57.489 --> 00:59:59.651
- Yeah.
- Hey, Hal.

732
00:59:59.821 --> 01:00:02.194
We're gonna take one last jump and split.

733
01:00:02.364 --> 01:00:04.155
You baby-sitting hikers or what?

734
01:00:06.788 --> 01:00:08.540
- Run, man, run! Go!
- What?

735
01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:10.041
Run! Get the hell out...

736
01:00:24.966 --> 01:00:26.518
No!

737
01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:41.402
Son of a bitch. You didn't have to kill...

738
01:00:41.482 --> 01:00:42.694
Shut up!

739
01:00:44.235 --> 01:00:45.536
Sue me.

740
01:00:49.661 --> 01:00:50.491
Fuck.

741
01:01:22.233 --> 01:01:23.404
Shoot him! Dammit.

742
01:01:24.365 --> 01:01:25.446
Shoot him!

743
01:01:25.866 --> 01:01:27.909
You're letting him get away! Shoot him!

744
01:01:49.850 --> 01:01:51.392
Shit. Ow!

745
01:01:56.357 --> 01:01:57.938
You murdering motherfuck.

746
01:01:58.979 --> 01:02:01.111
Kill a few people,
they call you a murderer.

747
01:02:02.403 --> 01:02:04.985
Kill a million, and you're a conqueror.

748
01:02:05.406 --> 01:02:06.527
Go figure.

749
01:02:07.698 --> 01:02:09.820
Move on, Tucker. Time is short.

750
01:02:56.576 --> 01:02:58.749
OK. Just like you said.

751
01:02:58.829 --> 01:03:01.171
- He's taking them the long way around.
- All right.

752
01:03:01.291 --> 01:03:03.754
To stay ahead of them, we're gonna
have to go through that crack.

753
01:03:08.548 --> 01:03:10.090
You said there was a way across.

754
01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:11.261
There is.

755
01:03:11.591 --> 01:03:13.433
- Where the fuck is it?
- There.

756
01:03:13.513 --> 01:03:14.845
You blind?

757
01:03:17.687 --> 01:03:20.310
Hell with the money. Radio the chopper.

758
01:03:23.103 --> 01:03:24.774
You just don't get it, do you?

759
01:03:24.854 --> 01:03:29.069
We're in bed now, joined at the hip,
partners in crime.

760
01:03:31.321 --> 01:03:35.205
You've crossed over, Travers,
and there's no crossing back.

761
01:03:57.807 --> 01:03:59.349
All right, that'll keep it dry.

762
01:04:08.358 --> 01:04:10.570
OK, let's do it.

763
01:04:14.784 --> 01:04:15.945
Get a good footing.

764
01:04:17.947 --> 01:04:19.118
OK.

765
01:04:26.415 --> 01:04:27.667
It's slick, Jess.

766
01:04:31.631 --> 01:04:32.922
Good foothold.

767
01:05:07.336 --> 01:05:09.498
Jessie, don't move.

768
01:05:12.001 --> 01:05:14.053
Oh, my God.

769
01:05:16.675 --> 01:05:18.507
- Let's get out of here.
- No!

770
01:05:20.809 --> 01:05:22.471
Jessie, you gotta get down!

771
01:05:22.721 --> 01:05:23.973
Come on!

772
01:05:26.225 --> 01:05:27.396
Get down!

773
01:05:29.188 --> 01:05:30.479
Stay close to me.

774
01:05:35.024 --> 01:05:36.945
All right, get down. Head down.

775
01:05:37.025 --> 01:05:38.487
Hold on. Just hold on now.

776
01:05:40.409 --> 01:05:42.080
It's on my backpack!
It's on my back!

777
01:05:42.161 --> 01:05:43.782
Jessie, stop screaming.

778
01:05:47.666 --> 01:05:49.628
Stop, they're all over me.

779
01:05:49.838 --> 01:05:52.000
- Let's get out!
- There's one on my back!

780
01:05:52.090 --> 01:05:53.922
It's off your back. It's off your back.

781
01:05:54.002 --> 01:05:55.504
- No, there is.
- There's nothing on your back.

782
01:05:55.714 --> 01:05:58.297
It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.

783
01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:04.893
<i>Rocky Mountain Rescue Center,
this is Rescue 3. Over.</i>

784
01:06:06.475 --> 01:06:08.807
<i>Rescue three,
this is Rescue Center. Go ahead.</i>

785
01:06:10.228 --> 01:06:13.362
<i>The vis is good. I've got at least
20 miles in all directions.</i>

786
01:06:13.442 --> 01:06:15.614
<i>If anyone's out here,
I'll find them. Over.</i>

787
01:06:16.024 --> 01:06:18.276
<i>Roger, three. Center out.</i>

788
01:06:29.918 --> 01:06:31.329
<i>Center, this is three.</i>

789
01:06:31.790 --> 01:06:34.923
<i>I've picked up a signal on the thermal
imager just north of Comb Bluff.</i>

790
01:06:35.213 --> 01:06:36.585
<i>Landing to investigate.</i>

791
01:07:23.181 --> 01:07:27.305
Hey! Get out! Get out of here!

792
01:07:29.017 --> 01:07:30.558
Get the hell out!

793
01:07:36.023 --> 01:07:37.485
Jesus Christ.

794
01:07:41.149 --> 01:07:43.571
Here, I got you. I got you.

795
01:07:43.901 --> 01:07:46.824
I got you, son. I got you.

796
01:07:47.825 --> 01:07:49.156
There's the opening.

797
01:07:49.907 --> 01:07:52.500
When I get up there, I'll hook up the line

798
01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:54.211
and you follow me up.

799
01:07:54.542 --> 01:07:56.544
- OK?
- All right.

800
01:08:05.723 --> 01:08:08.976
- The other one is following.
- I'll move to a high point, flank him.

801
01:08:09.136 --> 01:08:11.018
Don't kill him until you get the money.

802
01:08:11.389 --> 01:08:12.600
Sure.

803
01:08:18.686 --> 01:08:20.858
<i>Mr. Wright,
we found the I.D. on the dead pilot.</i>

804
01:08:20.938 --> 01:08:22.940
<i>He was known to fly for Qualen. Over.</i>

805
01:08:23.110 --> 01:08:25.533
<i>Well, what about
the Treasury jet? Over.</i>

806
01:08:25.613 --> 01:08:27.535
<i>Its wreckage is scattered
over a two-mile area.</i>

807
01:08:27.695 --> 01:08:29.326
<i>No bodies have been found. Over.</i>

808
01:08:30.157 --> 01:08:33.911
Finally. An F.A.A. satellite
has located a downed aircraft.

809
01:08:34.161 --> 01:08:36.503
Head 110 miles south-southwest

810
01:08:36.584 --> 01:08:38.165
- of the park entrance.
- OK.

811
01:08:38.626 --> 01:08:41.669
<i>Treasury Control,
get the rescued people on their way.</i>

812
01:08:41.759 --> 01:08:43.841
<i>We're headed straight there. One out.</i>

813
01:08:43.961 --> 01:08:45.012
<i>Center out.</i>

814
01:09:10.697 --> 01:09:12.950
- I got it, Jess.
- Yeah.

815
01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:15.542
We're almost out.
I can chop through.

816
01:09:44.231 --> 01:09:45.442
Jessie, come on up!

817
01:09:45.522 --> 01:09:47.023
OK!

818
01:09:53.330 --> 01:09:54.581
Walker.

819
01:09:54.661 --> 01:09:56.623
Small world, ain't it?

820
01:09:58.164 --> 01:09:59.496
Don't even think about it.

821
01:10:01.087 --> 01:10:02.999
Your life's on sale, Walker.

822
01:10:03.089 --> 01:10:04.841
The price is 30 million.

823
01:10:04.921 --> 01:10:07.173
- Where is it?
- It's gone.

824
01:10:08.845 --> 01:10:11.718
What the fuck are you talking about?
Where's the money?

825
01:10:11.798 --> 01:10:14.641
I burned it. Never could save anything.

826
01:10:15.682 --> 01:10:19.516
Not even a dumb mountain boy like you
would burn $30 million.

827
01:10:20.226 --> 01:10:22.769
I don't make deals, Walker,
but I'll make one with you.

828
01:10:23.189 --> 01:10:26.653
Hand over the money,
and I'll just kill you and not the girl.

829
01:10:28.154 --> 01:10:29.445
Now, give me the money!

830
01:10:33.569 --> 01:10:34.911
Gabe?

831
01:10:37.163 --> 01:10:38.324
All right.

832
01:10:52.929 --> 01:10:54.140
Gabe.

833
01:10:54.801 --> 01:10:56.472
Come on up. Come on!

834
01:10:57.683 --> 01:10:59.095
- Can you walk?
- Yeah.

835
01:10:59.555 --> 01:11:01.187
Kynette, what's going on?
Where's the money?

836
01:11:02.939 --> 01:11:05.191
- He said he torched it.
<i>- Where is he now?</i>

837
01:11:05.311 --> 01:11:06.943
He dropped down into some cave.

838
01:11:08.104 --> 01:11:09.695
You've had your chance. Move it out now.

839
01:11:09.775 --> 01:11:11.697
- Kristel, get the C-4.
<i>- Roger.</i>

840
01:11:12.408 --> 01:11:13.819
Just give me five minutes.

841
01:11:13.909 --> 01:11:16.662
I said get the fuck out of there.

842
01:11:16.742 --> 01:11:19.665
Good. And blow up that black bastard
while you're at it.

843
01:11:20.076 --> 01:11:21.827
Save me the time of doing it myself.

844
01:11:41.477 --> 01:11:45.020
It you want me, I'll be here!

845
01:11:50.776 --> 01:11:52.358
I'm in here!

846
01:12:04.830 --> 01:12:06.161
I'm in here.

847
01:12:11.917 --> 01:12:13.469
You're making it too easy for me.

848
01:12:19.805 --> 01:12:20.976
No!

849
01:12:38.363 --> 01:12:39.574
No bullets, bitch!

850
01:12:49.334 --> 01:12:52.547
Now, I'm gonna ask you just three times,
where's the money?

851
01:12:56.461 --> 01:12:57.512
Sissy.

852
01:12:57.802 --> 01:12:59.134
You hit like a sissy.

853
01:13:01.516 --> 01:13:03.969
Wrong answer, motherfucker!

854
01:13:07.272 --> 01:13:08.523
Get up!

855
01:13:09.184 --> 01:13:11.816
Now, I'm gonna ask you for a second time.

856
01:13:12.357 --> 01:13:14.859
Where is the money?

857
01:13:16.441 --> 01:13:17.532
Burned it.

858
01:13:18.483 --> 01:13:20.485
Wrong answer!

859
01:13:29.124 --> 01:13:31.126
Time to kill a mountain man.

860
01:13:36.301 --> 01:13:40.425
It amazes me, in this day and age,
when a man

861
01:13:40.965 --> 01:13:42.217
will put money

862
01:13:42.637 --> 01:13:44.349
before the personal safety

863
01:13:44.759 --> 01:13:47.722
of himself and his bitch.

864
01:13:52.477 --> 01:13:55.019
At least you can go to your grave knowing

865
01:13:55.109 --> 01:13:57.111
that I'm gonna treat the bitch...

866
01:13:58.523 --> 01:13:59.774
right!

867
01:14:18.252 --> 01:14:22.216
Gabe, are you OK? Oh, God!
Oh, God! I thought he killed you!

868
01:14:23.427 --> 01:14:26.050
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. I'm all right.

869
01:14:29.263 --> 01:14:31.856
<i>Hal, Jessie, do you read?</i>

870
01:14:32.356 --> 01:14:34.478
<i>Again, do you read? Come in.</i>

871
01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:39.023
<i>Hal, Jessie, what the hell's
going on up there?</i>

872
01:14:39.113 --> 01:14:40.234
Jessie, find it.

873
01:14:54.578 --> 01:14:55.459
It's ready.

874
01:14:57.631 --> 01:14:59.543
Rescue 1, Rescue 2.

875
01:14:59.633 --> 01:15:02.586
<i>- Do you copy? Over.</i>
- Here it is! Here it is!

876
01:15:02.756 --> 01:15:04.798
<i>I found Evan in the east valley.</i>

877
01:15:05.299 --> 01:15:07.051
<i>He's got a gunshot wound in the back.</i>

878
01:15:07.141 --> 01:15:10.304
<i>He's en route to the medical center
in Granby in critical condition.</i>

879
01:15:11.185 --> 01:15:13.767
<i>In case you can hear this,
I'm resuming my search.</i>

880
01:15:14.598 --> 01:15:15.729
Come on!

881
01:15:18.812 --> 01:15:21.195
You'll make somebody a fine wife someday.

882
01:15:23.947 --> 01:15:25.279
You should see me bake a cake.

883
01:15:39.122 --> 01:15:42.376
He's still alive,
for another four minutes.

884
01:15:42.926 --> 01:15:43.877
Where's it set?

885
01:15:43.967 --> 01:15:45.799
Primed to go off
right over his head.

886
01:15:46.430 --> 01:15:48.302
Fuck!

887
01:15:50.053 --> 01:15:52.015
Gabe, three minutes! There's a bomb!

888
01:15:52.095 --> 01:15:56.309
Get the hell out of there!
There's a bomb over your head! Gabe...

889
01:15:58.772 --> 01:16:00.103
Jessie, get the gear!

890
01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:09.953
Come on, Jessie. This way.

891
01:16:10.323 --> 01:16:13.116
That charge is gonna cause a landslide.
We gotta get to the west face.

892
01:16:17.210 --> 01:16:18.662
Why the hell are we wasting time?

893
01:16:18.752 --> 01:16:21.164
Making sure he's not going
to find that last case.

894
01:16:27.090 --> 01:16:28.882
You want to kill me, don't you, Tucker?

895
01:16:30.263 --> 01:16:32.345
Well, take a number and get in line.

896
01:16:37.270 --> 01:16:38.391
All right, the ledge is too far.

897
01:16:38.481 --> 01:16:40.433
Take this rope and pull it apart
and tie it together.

898
01:16:40.483 --> 01:16:42.685
- We're gonna rappel down.
- This rope is 60 years old.

899
01:16:42.776 --> 01:16:44.437
- Will it hold?
- Don't think so.

900
01:16:44.527 --> 01:16:45.688
Bad answer.

901
01:17:00.793 --> 01:17:04.377
- Frank! Frank!
- Frank! Frank!

902
01:17:04.457 --> 01:17:06.799
- No, Frank!
- He can't see you, Jess. He can't see you.

903
01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:08.341
Go!

904
01:17:24.437 --> 01:17:26.279
Here comes our ride. Move.

905
01:17:29.402 --> 01:17:31.984
OK, now, swing as hard as you can.
Push!

906
01:18:05.017 --> 01:18:06.228
Gabe...

907
01:18:19.912 --> 01:18:20.993
Jump.

908
01:19:17.639 --> 01:19:20.722
Frank! Frank! Frank!

909
01:19:21.843 --> 01:19:23.765
Frank! Frank!

910
01:19:24.976 --> 01:19:26.898
Frank! No!

911
01:19:27.269 --> 01:19:29.441
Frank!

912
01:19:55.006 --> 01:19:57.759
What's happening here?
Where's the rest of the group?

913
01:19:59.511 --> 01:20:00.512
Welcome.

914
01:20:01.683 --> 01:20:02.634
What are you doing?

915
01:20:03.224 --> 01:20:04.475
Now, back off!

916
01:20:05.847 --> 01:20:07.519
Well, I came here to help you.

917
01:20:07.599 --> 01:20:08.640
You did.

918
01:20:09.891 --> 01:20:11.142
Don't move.

919
01:20:16.027 --> 01:20:18.740
- Frank! Frank!
- Better hurry, Tucker.

920
01:20:18.820 --> 01:20:20.111
A friend in need.

921
01:20:20.241 --> 01:20:22.243
Get the hell out of here!

922
01:20:24.325 --> 01:20:25.656
Frank!

923
01:20:34.756 --> 01:20:36.918
No!

924
01:20:45.176 --> 01:20:46.637
You stupid maniac!

925
01:20:47.178 --> 01:20:50.101
- No one told you to shoot.
- We've wasted enough time.

926
01:20:50.181 --> 01:20:51.482
Frank?

927
01:21:06.077 --> 01:21:08.199
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

928
01:21:15.376 --> 01:21:17.878
This man never hurt anybody!

929
01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:20.511
Touching.

930
01:21:21.462 --> 01:21:23.594
Kristel, check the chopper. Let's go.

931
01:21:52.162 --> 01:21:53.834
Get back! Get back!

932
01:21:53.914 --> 01:21:56.086
Go! Jessie, run!

933
01:22:16.016 --> 01:22:17.648
That son of a bitch.

934
01:22:19.399 --> 01:22:23.023
All right. We use a chopper
to locate the third case.

935
01:22:23.323 --> 01:22:25.866
- Then we get the hell out of here.
- No.

936
01:22:26.236 --> 01:22:28.238
There's not enough fuel to search around.

937
01:22:28.488 --> 01:22:30.120
Just enough to get us down.

938
01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:32.202
You're not running things, Travers.

939
01:22:33.743 --> 01:22:36.746
As soon as he finds the money,
you're as dead as me.

940
01:22:38.839 --> 01:22:40.290
Give me the monitor.

941
01:22:41.631 --> 01:22:42.843
Now.

942
01:22:56.106 --> 01:22:59.769
- What's the code, Travers?
- I told you, Qualen.

943
01:22:59.859 --> 01:23:03.063
Fifty thousand possible
key code combinations...

944
01:23:03.313 --> 01:23:05.115
in 15-second intervals.

945
01:23:05.985 --> 01:23:08.618
So, what's the fucking code?

946
01:23:15.825 --> 01:23:17.997
Well, look what Agent Travers found.

947
01:23:18.248 --> 01:23:21.421
I guess he is running things after all.
Isn't he?

948
01:23:23.923 --> 01:23:27.006
So what's the plan, Travers?
We use the chopper to find the money.

949
01:23:27.086 --> 01:23:28.047
Right?

950
01:23:29.259 --> 01:23:31.010
What a good idea.

951
01:23:32.051 --> 01:23:33.393
But then again...

952
01:23:34.724 --> 01:23:36.476
without a pilot...

953
01:23:37.557 --> 01:23:39.809
nobody even gets off this mountain.

954
01:23:41.561 --> 01:23:42.692
What are you doing, Eric?

955
01:23:44.604 --> 01:23:48.988
- Do you know what real love is, Kristel?
- No.

956
01:23:51.451 --> 01:23:53.162
Sacrifice.

957
01:24:05.004 --> 01:24:07.426
Now I'm the only one
who can fly us out of here.

958
01:24:07.797 --> 01:24:09.298
We're partners again.

959
01:24:11.010 --> 01:24:13.182
Now, take your toy...

960
01:24:13.973 --> 01:24:16.095
and find our money.

961
01:24:18.517 --> 01:24:20.139
Radio when you find it.

962
01:24:22.481 --> 01:24:24.063
I'm waiting here.

963
01:24:33.322 --> 01:24:35.494
All right, the last of the money's
at Crockett River.

964
01:24:35.614 --> 01:24:37.496
If we take the northern ridge,
we can get there first.

965
01:24:37.576 --> 01:24:38.747
Look, there is no "we."

966
01:24:39.328 --> 01:24:41.961
What I'm gonna do is go along
the north trail to Bitker Ladder.

967
01:24:42.041 --> 01:24:43.963
And you go on to the station for help.

968
01:24:44.043 --> 01:24:45.044
Are you crazy?

969
01:24:45.124 --> 01:24:47.256
Look, if they find the money,
Hal's dead.

970
01:24:47.626 --> 01:24:49.878
- Just get back there fast.
- All right.

971
01:24:49.969 --> 01:24:51.670
<i>Roger, Control.
But where the hell</i>

972
01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:53.592
<i>are those National Guard choppers? Over.</i>

973
01:24:53.882 --> 01:24:56.425
<i>They had a mechanical,
sir. It's being worked on now.</i>

974
01:24:56.555 --> 01:24:59.018
<i>- Their E.T.A. is one hour.</i>
- An hour?

975
01:24:59.098 --> 01:25:01.980
Well, you got to do better than that.
Now, get a move on. Out.

976
01:26:27.565 --> 01:26:28.766
Stop there.

977
01:26:33.071 --> 01:26:34.232
We're close.

978
01:26:34.822 --> 01:26:36.274
I got it locked in.

979
01:26:37.655 --> 01:26:39.277
So we're finished with him, yeah?

980
01:26:40.989 --> 01:26:42.280
Yeah. Do it quietly.

981
01:26:43.491 --> 01:26:45.873
Your insane boss just made enough noise

982
01:26:45.913 --> 01:26:47.915
for anyone within ten miles to hear us.

983
01:26:51.499 --> 01:26:52.880
It's been fun.

984
01:26:58.846 --> 01:27:00.798
Hey, Delmar.

985
01:27:01.719 --> 01:27:02.930
From me to you...

986
01:27:04.472 --> 01:27:05.803
you're an asshole.

987
01:27:07.185 --> 01:27:08.266
Yeah?

988
01:27:08.686 --> 01:27:10.978
And you're a loudmouth, punk slag

989
01:27:11.729 --> 01:27:13.231
who's about to die.

990
01:27:14.312 --> 01:27:15.313
Maybe.

991
01:27:17.024 --> 01:27:18.906
But in a minute I'll be dead.

992
01:27:19.987 --> 01:27:21.028
You...

993
01:27:22.029 --> 01:27:23.781
will always be an asshole.

994
01:27:24.492 --> 01:27:26.163
So go ahead and shoot.

995
01:27:26.994 --> 01:27:28.746
I'm getting cold.

996
01:27:32.830 --> 01:27:33.881
Shoot!

997
01:27:36.834 --> 01:27:38.335
Who's shooting?

998
01:27:44.552 --> 01:27:45.432
Tell me...

999
01:27:46.093 --> 01:27:47.515
do you like soccer?

1000
01:27:48.435 --> 01:27:49.937
It's a great sport.

1001
01:27:50.017 --> 01:27:54.481
I was a fucking good striker.
Isn't that something?

1002
01:28:05.412 --> 01:28:07.825
Oh, God!

1003
01:28:08.115 --> 01:28:09.416
Fuck you!

1004
01:28:09.496 --> 01:28:11.538
Ah, you're swearing now.

1005
01:28:13.290 --> 01:28:16.543
That's a penalty kick for unsportsmanlike.

1006
01:28:21.839 --> 01:28:23.090
A lovely little chip shot.

1007
01:28:26.223 --> 01:28:28.015
He dribbles past one defender...

1008
01:28:28.555 --> 01:28:29.686
two defenders...

1009
01:28:31.308 --> 01:28:32.519
three defenders.

1010
01:28:40.237 --> 01:28:42.319
Striker lines up at the penalty spot.

1011
01:28:43.070 --> 01:28:44.531
He focuses on the ball.

1012
01:28:44.611 --> 01:28:46.533
The crowd is on its feet.

1013
01:28:47.034 --> 01:28:49.076
Striker moves to his left.

1014
01:28:49.706 --> 01:28:51.118
He draws back his foot.

1015
01:28:51.578 --> 01:28:52.749
He comes in.

1016
01:29:13.270 --> 01:29:14.811
Season's over, asshole!

1017
01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:24.611
I said quietly.

1018
01:29:58.024 --> 01:29:59.936
What the fuck is going on?

1019
01:30:01.898 --> 01:30:03.529
This is not right.

1020
01:30:18.414 --> 01:30:19.665
What the fuck!

1021
01:30:19.796 --> 01:30:21.627
Shit!

1022
01:30:38.474 --> 01:30:39.895
Goddamn.

1023
01:30:40.476 --> 01:30:42.818
Fuck you, Walker!

1024
01:30:46.522 --> 01:30:48.074
Fucker!

1025
01:30:57.032 --> 01:30:58.334
Goddamn it!

1026
01:31:02.918 --> 01:31:04.290
Come in, goddamn it.

1027
01:31:07.092 --> 01:31:08.674
Have you got what we need?

1028
01:31:08.924 --> 01:31:12.348
<i>It's Walker. The son of a bitch
is still alive, Qualen.</i>

1029
01:31:12.638 --> 01:31:14.390
No names. This is an open line.

1030
01:31:14.470 --> 01:31:16.972
I don't give a shit, Eric Qualen!

1031
01:31:18.644 --> 01:31:20.686
Had to be insane to tie up

1032
01:31:20.766 --> 01:31:23.018
with a lowlife piece of shit
like you anyway.

1033
01:31:24.019 --> 01:31:24.900
They beat us.

1034
01:31:26.402 --> 01:31:29.485
<i>A couple of fucking
mountain rangers beat us.</i>

1035
01:31:30.235 --> 01:31:33.989
Jesus Christ, that's Travers.
Get a bead on that frequency.

1036
01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:37.372
They beat the man
no law agency ever could.

1037
01:31:37.453 --> 01:31:38.704
Get off the radio.

1038
01:31:38.784 --> 01:31:41.707
And I'm finding that
pretty fucking hilarious, Qualen.

1039
01:31:41.787 --> 01:31:43.999
Stop transmitting, you stupid bastard!

1040
01:31:44.750 --> 01:31:47.292
It's hard to believe
I sold out after 20 years

1041
01:31:47.382 --> 01:31:48.674
and this is my payback?

1042
01:31:49.795 --> 01:31:52.678
To run on a mountain
with a fucking dirtbag like you!

1043
01:31:53.258 --> 01:31:55.340
Travers, you've lost your mind.

1044
01:31:56.511 --> 01:31:58.433
Lost it. Have I lost it?

1045
01:31:58.724 --> 01:32:02.477
Fucking, yeah, I've lost it, Qualen!
Pure, fucking Section Eight!

1046
01:32:04.559 --> 01:32:05.560
<i>I gotta go.</i>

1047
01:32:06.601 --> 01:32:08.653
I'm on my last official manhunt.

1048
01:32:10.445 --> 01:32:12.237
<i>Adios</i>, motherfucker!

1049
01:32:20.245 --> 01:32:22.167
You got a bearing on that frequency yet?

1050
01:32:23.368 --> 01:32:25.040
<i>Yes. Eight minutes away.</i>

1051
01:32:44.479 --> 01:32:46.441
You're dead, Walker!

1052
01:33:42.196 --> 01:33:45.499
Frank! Frank! Frank!

1053
01:33:47.792 --> 01:33:50.454
Frank! Frank!

1054
01:35:22.295 --> 01:35:23.847
I won, Walker!

1055
01:35:41.695 --> 01:35:44.157
Gabe! Gabe!

1056
01:36:05.588 --> 01:36:06.970
Travers, come in.

1057
01:36:10.643 --> 01:36:11.935
Travers, come in.

1058
01:36:13.056 --> 01:36:16.059
Compliments of Delmar.
Too late. You missed him.

1059
01:36:16.149 --> 01:36:18.481
He decided to take a swim to Arizona.

1060
01:36:18.651 --> 01:36:20.603
- Tucker.
<i>- That's right.</i>

1061
01:36:22.405 --> 01:36:24.197
<i>Congratulations.</i>

1062
01:36:24.857 --> 01:36:25.698
Qualen?

1063
01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:28.451
<i>It's all over.</i>

1064
01:36:28.952 --> 01:36:32.285
Walker. You resilient bastard.

1065
01:36:32.365 --> 01:36:33.956
So you're still alive.

1066
01:36:35.078 --> 01:36:37.080
I want that money, and I want it now.

1067
01:36:37.170 --> 01:36:39.001
Qualen, the game's over.

1068
01:36:39.832 --> 01:36:40.833
You lost.

1069
01:36:40.923 --> 01:36:44.046
Oh, no. The game's
just getting interesting.

1070
01:36:44.757 --> 01:36:46.799
<i>I'm airborne now, you see.</i>

1071
01:36:47.510 --> 01:36:50.763
As a matter of fact,
I've picked up a passenger

1072
01:36:50.843 --> 01:36:52.515
I think you might be interested in.

1073
01:36:54.887 --> 01:36:56.138
Go on, talk.

1074
01:36:56.889 --> 01:36:58.691
I said talk, goddamn it!

1075
01:37:00.393 --> 01:37:03.816
Gabe. Hal, he's got me. I'm sorry.
I thought he was Frank.

1076
01:37:04.567 --> 01:37:05.988
You get the picture, Walker?

1077
01:37:06.779 --> 01:37:08.281
<i>Now, I want that money.</i>

1078
01:37:08.651 --> 01:37:11.324
Meet me at the highest point
from where you are.

1079
01:37:11.744 --> 01:37:17.249
It you don't, we're going to find out
it this little angel of yours can fly.

1080
01:37:18.621 --> 01:37:21.083
Jessie, take him to the highest point
near Bitker Ladder.

1081
01:37:21.914 --> 01:37:24.296
<i>I'll meet you there. Don't worry.</i>

1082
01:37:24.376 --> 01:37:26.419
Love's a killer, isn't it?

1083
01:37:42.234 --> 01:37:43.525
Where are you, Walker?

1084
01:37:43.736 --> 01:37:45.317
<i>You're getting warmer.
Keep climbing.</i>

1085
01:37:46.899 --> 01:37:48.490
<i>You're getting closer, Qualen.</i>

1086
01:37:48.570 --> 01:37:49.782
<i>Look out.</i>

1087
01:38:08.420 --> 01:38:10.923
<i>I must admit,
you're a real piece of work.</i>

1088
01:38:11.093 --> 01:38:13.765
Yeah, and I must admit,
you're a real piece of shit.

1089
01:38:24.106 --> 01:38:25.477
Throw it up, or I'll kill her.

1090
01:38:25.978 --> 01:38:28.190
You do, and the cash is gone.

1091
01:38:29.441 --> 01:38:30.612
The money.

1092
01:38:31.483 --> 01:38:34.406
I want you to put her down. Over there!

1093
01:39:28.590 --> 01:39:29.751
Jessie, run!

1094
01:39:29.841 --> 01:39:32.043
- What about you?
- Run!

1095
01:39:33.845 --> 01:39:34.966
Run!

1096
01:39:36.848 --> 01:39:37.929
Come on, Qualen.

1097
01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:41.142
I got what you want. Come on.

1098
01:39:49.310 --> 01:39:50.732
<i>Come on. Come and get it.</i>

1099
01:39:56.738 --> 01:39:58.199
<i>Come on. Closer.</i>

1100
01:39:59.530 --> 01:40:01.032
<i>Come on, closer.</i>

1101
01:40:02.073 --> 01:40:04.205
<i>- A little closer, Qualen.</i>
- Throw it in.

1102
01:40:04.285 --> 01:40:06.127
Bring it closer.

1103
01:40:07.418 --> 01:40:08.379
Oh, my God.

1104
01:40:16.047 --> 01:40:17.258
Throw it in.

1105
01:40:34.855 --> 01:40:36.357
Damn you, Walker!

1106
01:40:53.043 --> 01:40:54.215
Run!

1107
01:41:33.413 --> 01:41:35.836
Jessie, move, move!

1108
01:41:47.267 --> 01:41:48.228
Come on.

1109
01:42:12.452 --> 01:42:13.583
Gabe!

1110
01:42:28.098 --> 01:42:30.720
It's just us now, you piece of shit.

1111
01:42:45.485 --> 01:42:46.576
Gabe!

1112
01:42:46.826 --> 01:42:48.488
Watch out!

1113
01:42:48.948 --> 01:42:50.700
Get out of there, man!

1114
01:42:54.544 --> 01:42:56.205
Stick around.

1115
01:42:59.919 --> 01:43:00.880
We had a deal...

1116
01:43:02.001 --> 01:43:03.923
and now we've just got each other.

1117
01:43:05.004 --> 01:43:06.556
You're not afraid to die.

1118
01:43:12.642 --> 01:43:13.473
Come on, get him!

1119
01:43:18.858 --> 01:43:20.399
- Gabe!
- Get out of there!

1120
01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:21.360
It's gonna fall!

1121
01:43:21.861 --> 01:43:25.274
Remember, shithead.
Keep your arms and legs in the vehicle

1122
01:43:25.615 --> 01:43:27.827
at all times!

1123
01:43:48.347 --> 01:43:49.678
Give me the rope!

1124
01:43:53.973 --> 01:43:54.974
OK.

1125
01:43:59.308 --> 01:44:00.769
I'm out of here.

1126
01:44:23.582 --> 01:44:27.466
Gabe, buddy, you think you could have
put a little less effort in that climb?

1127
01:44:27.756 --> 01:44:29.798
I mean, I thought you were in shape.

1128
01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:33.682
- I guess I'm just falling apart.
- Yeah.

1129
01:44:33.762 --> 01:44:35.474
This is Agent Wright. Copy?

1130
01:44:35.554 --> 01:44:36.685
Yeah, copy.

1131
01:44:37.186 --> 01:44:39.228
<i>Please identify yourselves. Over.</i>

1132
01:44:39.308 --> 01:44:41.900
Yeah, this is Hal Tucker,
Rocky Mountain Rescue.

1133
01:44:42.561 --> 01:44:44.443
<i>Hey, we're glad to see you guys.</i>

1134
01:44:44.853 --> 01:44:46.655
<i>If you're looking for Mr. Qualen...</i>

1135
01:44:46.735 --> 01:44:49.778
try about 4,000 feet south of here.

1136
01:44:49.858 --> 01:44:52.531
<i>He'll be the one
wearing a helicopter. Over.</i>

1137
01:44:53.412 --> 01:44:56.705
<i>Good. I'll arrange transportation
for the three of you.</i>

1138
01:44:56.785 --> 01:44:58.206
<i>You can sit tight for a while.</i>
