1
00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.080
Rescue 3.
Jessie, do you see him yet?

2
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.020
Patience, my love, patience.

3
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.230
Wait a minute.
I think I have him sighted.

4
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.130
Frank, what's the word?

5
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.170
The word is we got him
over there.

6
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.010
Rescue 3, this is Rescue Center.
Over.

7
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.600
This is 3. Go ahead.

8
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.950
Jessie, we're getting general clearance
in the southeastern region of the park.

9
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.750
You will probably have sufficient
cloud base to get into the tower...

10
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.480
but please be advised you'll still
encounter strong winds and turbulence.

11
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.460
We would advise
against a winch rescue. Over.

12
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.990
Wilco, Center. I'll proceed
with wire cross from opposite tower.

13
00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.500
- Three out.
- Center out.

14
00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.780
Gabe, Hal's signaling he's okay.

15
00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.610
Gabe?

16
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.920
Gabe, where are you?

17
00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.020
I'm just hanging out, Jess.

18
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.630
Oh, my God.

19
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.460
I don't recognize the face,
but the butt does look vaguely familiar.

20
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.200
Hey, be careful,
or you'll embarrass old Frank.

21
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.740
It would take a heap more
than that, rock-jock.

22
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.370
Yeah.

23
00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.650
Gabe?

24
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.980
They're below
the top of the tower.

25
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.050
They're on the ledge
just above you.

26
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.150
You got another few feet.

27
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.360
- Glad you could join us.
- Yeah, sure. Hi, Sarah.

28
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.770
Hi, Gabe.

29
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.400
So, how's the knee?

30
00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.910
I think it's out. No big deal.

31
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.640
I remember when you twisted it
getting out of that hot tub.

32
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.140
I thought it was
an old war wound from 'Nam.

33
00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.180
Really? Hmm.

34
00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.650
Rescue 3.

35
00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.120
I've located a stranded climber.

36
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.950
Jessie, please send down
a transport line.

37
00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.440
So, tell me, how you feeling?

38
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.800
Fine, considering.

39
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.140
What do you say we take oft...

40
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.580
and leave this clown behind, huh?

41
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:08.870
Don't tempt me.

42
00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.180
Rescue 3.

43
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.590
Please be advised
that Ranger Walker...

44
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.820
is making advances
toward my girlfriend...

45
00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.450
that's liable to get his ass kicked
right off this mountain.

46
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.730
Be informed Gabe makes advances
to me only...

47
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.670
or he'll be climbing down
4,000 feet and sleeping outside.

48
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.200
Baby, he lies.

49
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.300
- Is it really 4,000?
- Yeah, just about.

50
00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:13.810
Hey, remember, whatever this guy says
about me, don't believe it, okay?

51
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.140
Thanks.

52
00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:29.260
Okay. Come on over.

53
00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:37.190
I know you're nervous, but
we've done this a hundred times, okay?

54
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:38.740
Mm-hmm.

55
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.240
Excuse me, Captain Hot Tub?

56
00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.440
Keep your arms and legs
inside the vehicle at all times.

57
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.580
That's great, Hal.

58
00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.110
That really inspires confidence.

59
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.330
So, how did this clown talk you
into climbing up to the tower?

60
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.700
He told me
it was better than sex.

61
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:11.360
Really?

62
00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:16.270
You ready for the best ride
in the park?

63
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.370
Give me a second.
I'll let you know.

64
00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.280
You look like hell.

65
00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.650
He made it.

66
00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:36.660
Of course he did.

67
00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:38.820
Really, there's nothing to it.

68
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.690
Okay, I can do this.

69
00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:42.230
Sure you can.

70
00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.560
I'm sorry
for all the trouble, really.

71
00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.130
- Oh, Sarah, don't worry about it.
- Thanks.

72
00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:48.970
- Did you see that?
- Yeah, yeah.

73
00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:55.170
- We're still on for dinner tonight?
- Of course we are.

74
00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:56.680
Okay.

75
00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:59.910
Okay. You're ready now.

76
00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.250
That's it.

77
00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:06.850
Now, just sit
right down into it.

78
00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:11.160
Come on, guys.
The wind's picking up.

79
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:15.130
Sarah, just keep
your eyes on me.

80
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.630
No, don't look-- Sarah.

81
00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:19.260
Sarah, look at me. That's it.

82
00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:22.400
- Right.
- Just start to pull.

83
00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:24.340
One hand after another.

84
00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:27.840
You're doing great--
Really, great. Keep goin'.

85
00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:31.710
And just keep looking at me.

86
00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.340
That's great!
You're starting to look like a pro.

87
00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:36.150
Keep going.

88
00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:38.090
That's it. Nice and easy.

89
00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.350
Hey, Hal, we're gonna
be out of a job soon.

90
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:42.950
A little more, Sarah.

91
00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:44.550
That's it.

92
00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.560
One, two.

93
00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.140
Oh, God!

94
00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:56.040
Gabe! Gabe!

95
00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:58.080
No!

96
00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:59.630
Hold on!

97
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:03.800
- I'm going to fall!
- No, you're not!

98
00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.710
You're going to be okay!

99
00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:10.220
- Can you reach the main line?
- No, I can't! I'm slipping!

100
00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:13.590
- Gabe, can you keep the line steady?
- That clip's not gonna hold!

101
00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:16.590
I can't hold on!
Help me, please!

102
00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:19.320
- Gabe, you have to go after her.
- No!

103
00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.260
- Gabe, no!
- I'm coming out to get you!

104
00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:26.130
It's not rigged for two. Keep it from
swinging. I'll send out my harness.

105
00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.170
No time! I'm going tor her!

106
00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.210
Gabe, shit! No!

107
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.970
Sarah, I'm coming tor you!

108
00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.980
I can't hold on! I'm slipping!

109
00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:37.810
Hold on just a little bit longer!
I'm coming for you!

110
00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.110
Gabe, please hurry!
I can't hold on!

111
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:43.550
Don't look down.
Keep looking at me.

112
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:46.490
- That's it. Hold it.
- I'm trying!

113
00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.220
It's breaking. She's losing it.

114
00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:54.390
Sarah! He'll have you
in a second, baby!

115
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:56.930
Come on, baby!
Don't you give up!

116
00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:01.140
Hurry, Gabe.
You're almost there.

117
00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:03.540
- Keep going.
- I'm here, Sarah.

118
00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:05.370
Sarah, I'm here.

119
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:08.240
I don't want to die!

120
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:11.580
Reach up and grab him! Reach up!

121
00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:14.210
- Sarah, reach up!
- Come on, honey!

122
00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:16.150
- Use your other hand!
- Reach up!

123
00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:24.550
Hold on! Hold on!
I got you! I got you.

124
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:27.560
I can't hold on!
I'm going to die!

125
00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:29.960
You're not going to die.

126
00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:33.560
Don't you lose her, Gabe.

127
00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.300
I got her. Reach up.

128
00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:37.810
I'm slipping. I'm slipping!

129
00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:42.140
- You can do it, Sarah.
- Hold her, Gabe!

130
00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:43.980
Please don't let me fall.

131
00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:46.240
Please, I don't want to die.

132
00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.220
- You're not gonna die.
- I'm slipping!

133
00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:50.450
Sarah, I got you! Just reach up!

134
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.650
I can't, Gabe!

135
00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.120
You can do it.
Please, baby, just reach up!

136
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:57.990
Hal! Hal! I'm slipping!

137
00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:00.330
Gabe, man, don't you lose her!

138
00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.870
- Don't you let her go!
- Don't let me fall.

139
00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.200
I'm slipping!

140
00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:08.760
Sarah, please.

141
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.770
No, I'm slipping! Gabe!

142
00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.780
Gabe, don't let me fall!

143
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:16.180
- No!
- Help me! I'm talling! Gabe!

144
00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.520
No! Sarah, no!

145
00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.040
Jesus Christ.

146
00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:06.950
Treasury Agent Mac Lamoore,
please contact D.A.U.

147
00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:19.000
Lock 'em up.

148
00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.410
Travers, we'll be fueled up
and ready to go in ten minutes.

149
00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.680
Very good.

150
00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.510
Mr. Travers.

151
00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.690
- Hey, Rich.
- Morning, Walt.

152
00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.790
This is Agent Matheson, F.B.I.

153
00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:40.960
Travers.

154
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:44.260
Matheson has been transferred
from the Denver office to Frisco.

155
00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:48.430
As a professional courtesy
I was asked if he could hitch a ride.

156
00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:51.000
Got plenty of room.
Be glad to accommodate you.

157
00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.040
- Appreciate it.
- You're the boss.

158
00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:55.770
Let's go. Matheson,
have you been totally briefed?

159
00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:59.110
- I don't know about totally.
- Who the hell ever is?

160
00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:02.020
It's the most protected shipment
we've got and the most useless.

161
00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:04.110
These bills aren't even
in circulation.

162
00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:07.320
$1,000 bills we're transporting are only
used for international banking exchange.

163
00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:09.120
You always transport
through the air?

164
00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:11.820
Mostly. Armored cars can be hijacked,
trains derailed...

165
00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:14.060
but nobody can touch us in flight.

166
00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:16.830
Haven't lost a bill in 12 years.
Don't jinx me now.

167
00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:20.890
Treasury agents are the most
superstitious people in the government.

168
00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:23.500
We should be.
Everybody wants what we have.

169
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:44.020
Gabe! Hey, man, Gabe!

170
00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:46.320
- It's Gabe. He's back!
- I can see that.

171
00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.860
Come on, man. Let's go!

172
00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:12.280
How you doing, Gabe?

173
00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.380
Dude, turn that down.

174
00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:17.050
You guys.
How you doing, Brett, Evan?

175
00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:20.100
Where you been?
You fall off the planet or something?

176
00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.500
- No, I've been working up in Denver.
- Work?

177
00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:25.030
Don't say that word.

178
00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:27.800
I hate work, even when
somebody else is doing it.

179
00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:32.500
Gabe, we're fying off the tower today.
You should come with us.

180
00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.200
Today's going to be the day
for a killer jump.

181
00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:39.640
- No, thanks. Can't.
- Come on, man.

182
00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:43.120
Don't tell me that job in Denver
made you scared of heights?

183
00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:50.490
You guys better watch out 'cause
some bad weather's comin' in, okay?

184
00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.830
We like it extreme.

185
00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:57.330
Hey, man, see you later, Gabe.
Good to have you back.

186
00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.430
Yeah, good to see you. Later.

187
00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.100
Peace.

188
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:19.920
How you doing, Jess?

189
00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:27.420
Hello, Gabriel.

190
00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:32.370
Got yourself a new horse?

191
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:38.410
- Where have you been?
- Just working.

192
00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.610
After the funeral,
I just had to leave.

193
00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.770
Had to leave?

194
00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.370
Believe me, a lot of us
wanted to leave.

195
00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:49.850
But you know what?

196
00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.850
We stayed.

197
00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:56.320
Jess...

198
00:15:57.490 --> 00:15:59.660
a lot of things fell apart
on that ledge.

199
00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:01.320
I know.

200
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.300
But I don't think
you know how much.

201
00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:07.130
Why can't you just believe
you did everything you could?

202
00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.700
Did I? I don't know.

203
00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:11.970
Maybe I shouldn't have
gone out on that line.

204
00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:16.340
Maybe I panicked. I don't know.

205
00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:18.510
I was there, remember?

206
00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:20.880
You were the only one
who didn't panic.

207
00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:24.580
Why don't you do us a favor
and quit hording all the guilt?

208
00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:28.610
You held on as long as you could.
And what about Hal?

209
00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:32.490
What was Hal doing on the tower
with a girl who could barely climb?

210
00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.360
I can't blame Hal tor anything.
It was me.

211
00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:38.070
All me.

212
00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:40.660
Well, give it up, Gabe...

213
00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:43.260
because let me tell you something--
It doesn't get any better.

214
00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:46.000
It doesn't get any better?

215
00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:51.180
I really don't think
you understand.

216
00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:54.680
- What?
- I don't think you understand.

217
00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:56.690
I don't understand?

218
00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:00.990
I think I'm the only one
that understands.

219
00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:06.330
Believe me, there were times when I
didn't know what I wanted to do more--

220
00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:09.030
Hate you or love you.

221
00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:13.230
But one thing I did know
and I still do know...

222
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.570
is I understand you.

223
00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.980
Did you come back to stay?

224
00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:38.720
You didn't.

225
00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:43.330
I can't.

226
00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.770
I can't. Not here.

227
00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:51.100
Jessie, I came back tor you.

228
00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:54.870
And it you like,
I want you to come with me.

229
00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:03.420
You come back after being gone for
almost a year and expect me to leave?

230
00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.720
This is our home.

231
00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:10.920
Now it's my home.

232
00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:14.760
And I can't just pick up and go
for all the wrong reasons.

233
00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:27.610
If you don't mind, I'd better
pick up the rest of my stuff.

234
00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.340
You know where everything is.

235
00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:32.610
I'm late for work.

236
00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.390
Hey, big boy.

237
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:02.800
Roger, Five-Lima,
scattered, broken clouds...

238
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.110
20,000 feet with
a severe storm advisory.

239
00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:07.310
Check the storm scope.

240
00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:30.510
Travers says
you're being transferred.

241
00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:32.600
Oh, yeah.
Moving up in the world.

242
00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:51.530
The forecast-- cloudy skies
with flurries today.

243
00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.830
We can expect an inch of snow
and a high in the low 30's.

244
00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:58.830
Overnight flurries will increase with
a total accumulation of three inches.

245
00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:00.770
Tonight's low near 15.

246
00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:03.640
Hey, Jessie, you're just in time
tor another masterpiece.

247
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:05.200
Hiya, Jess.

248
00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.710
Oh, I think old Frank
nailed it with that stroke.

249
00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:10.610
What do you think?

250
00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:12.770
I don't know.

251
00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:14.840
What do you see?

252
00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:16.220
Surprise me.

253
00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:18.750
What usually eats a banana?

254
00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.550
A monkey.

255
00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:23.250
This is a picture
of a banana eating a monkey.

256
00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:25.820
- Nature in reverse.
- Where?

257
00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:28.500
Right here.

258
00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:34.060
Frank, you look like
a normal guy, but he's not...

259
00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:35.830
are you, Frankie?

260
00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:37.670
Hey, I'm an artist.

261
00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:52.790
We're being tracked.

262
00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:55.050
- Jetstar, three o'clock.
- Travers!

263
00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:58.220
Stay put. Don't anyone
jump to conclusions.

264
00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:06.330
- He's coming in too slow.
- No, we're going too fast.

265
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.530
We're too high. Give me 180 knots,
drop to 15,000 feet.

266
00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:11.440
You got it.

267
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:15.310
Christ. We're losing altitude
and slowing down. Get your weapons.

268
00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:18.210
What the hell are you doing?
I have jurisdiction on this jet.

269
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:22.980
Now I have jurisdiction.
I said get your weapons!

270
00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:25.920
These are highly trained agents,
Mr. Matheson.

271
00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:29.950
I think you're overreacting.
Just calm down and give me the gun.

272
00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:32.790
- You're out of control.
- What the hell are you waiting for?

273
00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:35.160
He's hijacking the shipment.

274
00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:57.310
What the fuck was that?

275
00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.360
- Move into position.
- Look alive, Kristel.

276
00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:14.770
Crossover transfer,
ten seconds and counting.

277
00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:16.700
November 1-2-niner-five Lima...

278
00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:19.140
this is Jetstar
6-8-0 Tango-Tango.

279
00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:21.870
Is frequency secure? Over.

280
00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:24.710
Roger, Tango-Tango.
This is Five-Lima. Go ahead.

281
00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:28.720
We have visual contact. What is
your heading, speed and level? Over.

282
00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:32.150
We're heading 0-8-0
and doing 2-5-0 knots level...

283
00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:34.690
at flight level 2-1-0-niner.

284
00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:36.690
Five-Lima, we're opening up.

285
00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:38.750
Rise and shine, gentlemen.
Let's make history.

286
00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:41.350
Roger, Five-Lima.
We'll begin closing.

287
00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:43.460
Bring your speed back to 1-5-0.

288
00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:48.370
Commence descent to flight level 1-4-0
and turn right onto 2-6-0. Over.

289
00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:54.340
We're level. Flight level 1-4-0
and steady, 2-6-0 degrees.

290
00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:56.350
The weather ahead
looks a bit threatening.

291
00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:58.400
Roger.

292
00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:01.210
- Travers, report your position.
- Ready to disengage tail cone.

293
00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:02.880
Stand by.

294
00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:12.230
- Tail cone's clear.
- Roger.

295
00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:30.240
Phase one complete.

296
00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:33.180
Tango-Tango,
prepare to receive cable.

297
00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:36.380
Tango-Tango standing by.

298
00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:38.390
Tango-Tango,
what's the turbulence back there?

299
00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:42.820
She's all over the place. This thing's
got the response of a 747 at this speed.

300
00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:46.620
Sounds like fun. We're streaming the
drogue down. We'll see you in a minute.

301
00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:49.260
Welcoming party's ready.
Good luck.

302
00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:52.930
We're moving in to pick up
the drogue now. Tango-Tango out.

303
00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:01.210
I've got it. Stand by, Kristel.

304
00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:03.210
Standing by.

305
00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:07.480
We're locked on.

306
00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:09.640
Into the transfer position.

307
00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:10.910
Check.

308
00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:13.390
Moving into transfer position.

309
00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:16.020
We're closing to 1-4-0 feet.

310
00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:19.960
We're closing.
We'll report when in position.

311
00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:25.930
- We're too close to the storm.
- Don't lose your nerve.

312
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.970
All they'll find is a plane
that went down in the storm.

313
00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:32.030
- Hurry up, Travers.
- On my way.

314
00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:34.370
The cases are hooked up
and ready.

315
00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:40.210
Charge goes off in five minutes.
Stick to the plan and you're rich.

316
00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.510
Got it.

317
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:45.180
Tango-Tango in position.

318
00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:47.520
- What's taking so long?
- Patience.

319
00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:53.260
Tango-Tango, dip the plane.
I'm coming over.

320
00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:56.160
Wilco, Five-Lima.
Tango-Tango standing by...

321
00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:58.760
at flight level 1-4-0
and steady 2-6-0 degrees.

322
00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:04.100
Five-Lima, I'm out of here.

323
00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:05.610
Roger.

324
00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:11.900
What the hell is he doing?

325
00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:15.850
Five-Lima, where are the cases?

326
00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:26.420
- Kristel, we've got him.
- Roger.

327
00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:28.790
Why didn't you send
the money first?

328
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:32.820
Somehow, I didn't think
you'd wait tor me if I sent it first.

329
00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:56.820
We're approaching the storm fast.
I can't hold this course much longer.

330
00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:59.990
- 9-0 seconds.
- What's keeping him?

331
00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:03.230
Let's move your ass up there.

332
00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.090
I'm at the cases. Stand by.

333
00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:09.100
Tango-Tango standing by.

334
00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:10.570
You fuck.

335
00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:20.140
We've lost the pilot.

336
00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:22.150
- Who did you leave up there?
- No one.

337
00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:31.480
Get underneath the jet.
The cases will slide over.

338
00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:38.060
Who the fuck is our guest?

339
00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:51.210
Just get those cases.

340
00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:53.270
He's hurt bad.
What should we do with him?

341
00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:56.380
Get him to a hospital, fast.

342
00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:03.930
- We're not leveling out.
- 1-0 seconds.

343
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:05.930
I've lost hydraulics!

344
00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:23.880
The cable's blown tree.

345
00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:26.380
Don't unhook it.
The cases are still there.

346
00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:28.820
- Don't lose the money, goddamn it!
- Hold it.

347
00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:31.320
- Pull the cable!
- We gotta pull!

348
00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:33.410
- Bypass switch one.
- Check.

349
00:27:33.490 --> 00:27:35.550
- Bypass switch two.
- Keep pulling.

350
00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:37.680
- Nothing.
- Switch to manual.

351
00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.660
Hold the fuckin' plane steady!

352
00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:43.260
- Pull! Come on!
- Travers, don't fuck it up!

353
00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:45.630
- How's number one engine?
- Oil pressure falling.

354
00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:49.100
- Come on. Don't lose the money.
- They're coming.

355
00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:50.970
Goddamn it! Shit!

356
00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:55.340
- We've lost it.
- Oh, fuck!

357
00:27:57.050 --> 00:27:58.640
Release the cable.

358
00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:03.450
Close it up.

359
00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:09.850
So this is your idea
of a foolproof plan?

360
00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:13.230
You stupid bastard.
Kristel, what's the report?

361
00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:16.320
The hydraulics aren't functioning.
He shot them out.

362
00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:17.920
Fire warning, line tour.

363
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.230
I'm losing altitude.
We're gonna go down!

364
00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:23.140
Dump the fuel. You'll have to pick
your way through the peaks.

365
00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:25.070
Close the fuel valve and pumps!

366
00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:30.780
Don't bother to buckle up.
You may not want to survive this.

367
00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:33.510
Flaps to 25 degrees
before we lose all power.

368
00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:35.610
Flaps, 25 degrees.

369
00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:38.520
Reduce power 60%.
Shut down all generators.

370
00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:45.260
Lower flaps. You may have
to hand-crank them down.

371
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.490
- You want the gear down?
- Leave the gear up. Shut down all power.

372
00:28:56.570 --> 00:29:00.070
Give me a hand
with the controls.

373
00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:46.790
Wow! Did you catch that thunder?

374
00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:49.450
That was too loud tor thunder.
Let's rock and roll.

375
00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:52.960
One, two, three!

376
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:58.460
- I'm free!
- Radical, man.

377
00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:01.500
Man, look at me. Watch this.

378
00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.510
Mike?

379
00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:19.550
Shit.

380
00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:28.190
You thought of everything,
didn't you?

381
00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:30.200
Everything except
what's happening now.

382
00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:34.590
Kill the pig!
Your fucking plan almost killed us!

383
00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:39.800
Kill the pig, my ass.
We're partners in this.

384
00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:40.970
Were.

385
00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:44.040
Give me the tracking monitor.

386
00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:46.550
What the hell are you
gonna do with it?

387
00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:48.210
Don't make him ask twice.

388
00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:50.880
Give it to him.

389
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:54.250
You want it? Take it.

390
00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:56.790
It's only got
50,000 code variations.

391
00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:59.060
I'll break your fucking neck
in a minute!

392
00:30:59.130 --> 00:31:01.260
- Go ahead. Break my fucking neck!
- Sit down.

393
00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.930
In case you slept
through the landing...

394
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.870
you'll need all the money you can find
to buy your way out of this country.

395
00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:10.130
You know it, and I know it.

396
00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:13.140
How do we get oft the mountain,
even if we find it?

397
00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:16.870
Kristel.

398
00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:22.950
I think we found a frequency.

399
00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:26.580
Somebody help, please.

400
00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:29.280
Is there somebody there?
Somebody please help.

401
00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:32.190
Rocky Mountain Rescue. Come in.

402
00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.390
Oh, thank God!

403
00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:39.830
Ah, we're stranded.
We were hiking and lost our bearings.

404
00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:42.170
We didn't expect
the weather to come in this fast.

405
00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:46.700
Just take it easy.
How many people in your party? Over.

406
00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:51.740
Five people.
I don't know where we are.

407
00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:57.580
I-- I see only a cylinder-type
rock formation. Over.

408
00:31:57.650 --> 00:31:59.320
It's got to be Comb Bluff.

409
00:31:59.390 --> 00:32:02.880
Winds are too strong to get a chopper
up there. Try to stay calm.

410
00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:04.980
We're on our way.
You're gonna be all right.

411
00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:08.430
Please hurry.
Billy's going into shock.

412
00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:10.590
Please, we need insulin.

413
00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:13.100
Please, hurry.

414
00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:17.840
"We need insulin."

415
00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:22.740
Would you have thought of that?

416
00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:37.290
- Thank God you didn't leave.
- Why?

417
00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:39.950
Emergency call. Five climbers
are stranded off Comb Bluff.

418
00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:43.190
The weather's pouring in,
and Hal's gone up alone.

419
00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:45.700
- Hal's a good climber.
- What?

420
00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:47.830
What's that supposed to mean?

421
00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:50.460
It means he can handle it himself.

422
00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:55.710
It he gets socked in by the weather,
they'll never make it down.

423
00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:58.770
Gabe, he needs someone
who has emergency medical training...

424
00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:00.870
and knows every handle
to those peaks.

425
00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:04.550
I'm the last one he wants help from, and
that's not what I came back here for.

426
00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:07.320
Our problems are not the issue
right now. Those people are.

427
00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:10.190
What if he can't do it alone?

428
00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:13.250
Look, Jessie,
I haven't climbed in months.

429
00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:15.130
You just lose the feel.

430
00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.960
Maybe you mean the nerve.

431
00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:26.540
I didn't mean that.

432
00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:31.310
It's okay.

433
00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:34.650
I know you don't want to be responsible
for anybody's life anymore...

434
00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:37.710
but I'm talking about somebody
that was your best friend.

435
00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:39.720
Please, Gabe,
he took the west ridge.

436
00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:42.820
It you take the north face,
you can beat him.

437
00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:47.450
What has happened to you?
Don't you feel anything anymore?

438
00:33:47.530 --> 00:33:51.490
Feel anything?
Jessie, I came back for you.

439
00:33:51.570 --> 00:33:53.500
I'm not talking about me.

440
00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:55.500
I'm talking about you.

441
00:33:57.910 --> 00:34:00.210
Go ahead-- Leave.

442
00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:03.770
But if you don't do it, you'll be stuck
on that ledge tor the rest of your life.

443
00:34:29.470 --> 00:34:31.440
Where the hell is that
goddamn plane?

444
00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:34.030
Looks like she went down
in the storm.

445
00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:37.810
That storm front is still building, so
even it we could send a search plane...

446
00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:40.750
it would be impossible
to see anything on the ground.

447
00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:44.620
- What about roads?
- There aren't any roads up there.

448
00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:46.620
Mr. Wright.

449
00:34:46.690 --> 00:34:49.160
These two F.B.I. agents
insist on seeing you.

450
00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:51.890
I'm Agent Hayes.
This is Agent Michaels.

451
00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:55.290
It you're concerned about your agent who
got a ride, I've nothing to tell you.

452
00:34:57.130 --> 00:35:00.470
Matheson wasn't along tor the ride.
He was working surveillance.

453
00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:02.600
Surveillance? Or what?

454
00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:05.900
The Bureau have been getting reports
Treasury jets were being monitored...

455
00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:07.770
between Denver
and San Francisco.

456
00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:10.780
We didn't tell you because
we thought it might be an inside job.

457
00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:14.210
That's impossible.
You're suggesting a hijacking?

458
00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:17.720
No. Not only did I have
my best men on that flight...

459
00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:20.220
but each one of those cases
were monitored.

460
00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:23.260
And the money
is in unexchangeable denominations.

461
00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:26.320
It would be useless
tor anybody to try to steal it.

462
00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:28.120
Except for this man.

463
00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:30.600
- Who the hell is this?
- Name is Eric Qualen.

464
00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:33.530
We've been tracking him
without much success.

465
00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:35.540
He's a former member
of military intelligence...

466
00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:38.100
who found it more profitable
going to the other side.

467
00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:41.630
Industrial espionage.
Hijacking diamonds from South Africa.

468
00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:44.680
Theft and disposal of millions
in negotiable bearer bonds.

469
00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:49.240
You name it. He has the international
connections to move this currency...

470
00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:53.480
and $100 million offers one hell
of a temptation to this psychotic.

471
00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:55.850
Jesus Christ.

472
00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:25.810
What the hell
are you doing up here, man?

473
00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:28.320
I was talking to Jessie.
She filled me in.

474
00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:30.090
Did she?

475
00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:32.250
Well, now let me fill you in.

476
00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:37.730
You can take your ass down and go back
to that hole you've been hiding in.

477
00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:42.200
Once we get these people down,
I'm gone, Hal.

478
00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:45.000
No. You're out of here now.

479
00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:50.970
Why the hell did you come up here?
To prove something?

480
00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:53.480
Look, I know how you feel
about me, all right.

481
00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:55.450
You don't know anything!

482
00:36:56.520 --> 00:37:00.150
You did it your way
and she died.

483
00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:12.300
- I did what I thought was right.
- Well, you were wrong.

484
00:37:12.370 --> 00:37:14.770
It was your weight on the line
that did it.

485
00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:17.400
There wasn't time
for anything else.

486
00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:19.340
Well, I guess we'll never know.

487
00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:21.430
It was a bad time tor everybody.

488
00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:24.140
What the hell do you know
about bad times, man?

489
00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:27.670
You didn't love her, and you didn't
have to explain to her family.

490
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:30.780
And you didn't have to look
into her eyes when she was falling!

491
00:37:30.850 --> 00:37:33.620
- Now drop it!
- No, buddy!

492
00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:38.920
It was you who dropped it.

493
00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:50.310
You want to do it?

494
00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:51.970
Do it.

495
00:37:57.210 --> 00:37:59.150
You live with it.

496
00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:32.640
They're here.

497
00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:34.710
Right on time.

498
00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:37.550
How many of them are there?

499
00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:41.580
We got two heroes.
We'll greet 'em at the top.

500
00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:52.070
- Where's the helicopter?
- What the hell's going on?

501
00:38:56.110 --> 00:38:59.600
- Where's the helicopter?
- It can't fly in this weather.

502
00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:02.700
- Is either of you a chopper pilot?
- No.

503
00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:05.080
What are your names?

504
00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:07.170
Tucker and Walker.

505
00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:09.080
We're missing three bags.

506
00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:10.740
What's in them?

507
00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:12.220
None of your tucking business!

508
00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:17.190
Suits, socks, $100 million,
the usual stuff.

509
00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:20.160
Travers here was smart enough
to bring along a tracking device.

510
00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:22.490
Don't use my name, goddamn it.

511
00:39:31.610 --> 00:39:32.870
Key it.

512
00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:38.410
Look at the map. This is where
we've lost our belongings.

513
00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:41.250
The red dots on the monitor
are the three cases.

514
00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:43.910
You recognize these locations?

515
00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:48.750
Let me jar your memory.

516
00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:50.990
It you don't recognize them,
you're useless.

517
00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:54.000
Useless items
are usually discarded.

518
00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:57.160
- Right, Travers?
- Get off my back, Qualen.

519
00:39:58.070 --> 00:39:59.630
Off?

520
00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:03.070
I haven't even got on it yet.

521
00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:07.800
Once again, do you recognize
these locations?

522
00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:15.310
Ryan.

523
00:40:22.530 --> 00:40:25.020
Yeah. We do.

524
00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:26.820
Then let's go.

525
00:40:31.770 --> 00:40:34.240
Wait a minute, asshole!

526
00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:39.130
Where is it?

527
00:40:45.310 --> 00:40:46.910
Up there.

528
00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:52.920
Rescue 1, this is Rescue Center.
Hal? Come in, Hal.

529
00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:55.820
Nice. You're Hal?

530
00:40:57.730 --> 00:40:59.820
You, stay. You!

531
00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:04.170
Fetch.

532
00:41:11.570 --> 00:41:13.970
Fetch!

533
00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:15.640
Do it.

534
00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:23.810
Rescue 1, this is Rescue Center.

535
00:41:23.890 --> 00:41:26.080
Do you copy?

536
00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:29.820
Hal, come in.
Hal, come in. Over.

537
00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:42.960
Watch yourself under the overhang.
It could deliver anytime.

538
00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:46.670
Anytime you feel
like saying something, don't.

539
00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:48.940
We're waiting, gentlemen.

540
00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:51.140
- I need my bolt gun and ice ax.
- No.

541
00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:54.270
- Don't give him anything.
- Take his coat tor insurance.

542
00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:57.550
He could freeze to death!

543
00:41:57.620 --> 00:42:00.210
You've got your own problems, Hal.

544
00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:08.230
Ryan, get a rope.
I want this dog on a leash too.

545
00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:13.690
Tie it. It better hold.

546
00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:25.610
Forget me. It you can, get away.

547
00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:27.270
Would you?

548
00:42:30.490 --> 00:42:32.420
Go fetch, wonder dog.

549
00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:56.710
Move it, Walker.

550
00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:03.410
Keep it taut.
Ryan, keep it taut!

551
00:43:06.490 --> 00:43:10.080
Hal, come in please.
Hal, come in please. Over.

552
00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:36.940
I don't trust him.

553
00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:12.750
Damn.

554
00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:21.190
I don't think
we need two guides.

555
00:44:22.530 --> 00:44:24.830
Retire him when he comes down.

556
00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:28.430
They're going to kill you!
Don't come down!

557
00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:30.600
Pull the rope. Pull the rope!

558
00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:35.700
Pull, goddamn it! Pull!

559
00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:43.580
- Come on! Pull!
- Pull it!

560
00:44:46.890 --> 00:44:48.290
Pull, goddamn it!

561
00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:49.950
Ow!

562
00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:07.840
Watch it!

563
00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:11.370
- Get him!
- No!

564
00:45:11.450 --> 00:45:13.070
Do it.

565
00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:37.260
Your friend just had
the most expensive tuneral in history.

566
00:46:37.330 --> 00:46:39.530
Now it's only you.

567
00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:42.130
Come in, Rescue Unit. Come in.

568
00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:45.400
Hal, what's going on? Hal?

569
00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:47.000
Talk.

570
00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:50.010
No messages, no codes,
no tricks.

571
00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:53.210
You haven't found us.
It was a take call.

572
00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:56.410
Jessie, I've just reached
the top ot the tower.

573
00:46:56.490 --> 00:46:58.820
So far,
there's no sign of anyone.

574
00:46:58.890 --> 00:47:01.320
Looks like a phony call. Over.

575
00:47:01.390 --> 00:47:05.420
You've got to be kidding me. Do you
want me to fly up atter you? Over.

576
00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:07.930
No. Negative.
The winds are still too high.

577
00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.330
I'm going to ride out
the storm up here.

578
00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:13.460
We'll take shelter
at the old Doug--

579
00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:15.200
Hal, I'm losing you. Come in.

580
00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:17.400
Come in, Hal. Over.

581
00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:20.310
Go on to the next case.

582
00:47:23.050 --> 00:47:26.810
He said the tower,
but he's on Comb Bluff.

583
00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:30.150
Frank, fly me to the west valley.
The winds are never too strong there.

584
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:32.590
It's only a half-hour climb
to the Douglas Shaft.

585
00:47:32.650 --> 00:47:35.020
It's the only shelter around.
Hal would have to go there.

586
00:47:35.090 --> 00:47:38.720
- Jessie, that is a bad idea.
- Please, Frank.

587
00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:41.790
If I don't find him,
you can come pick me up by nightfall.

588
00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:43.920
Hal would have my head.

589
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.870
And it's such a handsome head.

590
00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:51.540
Please, Frank.

591
00:47:51.610 --> 00:47:53.870
I'll buy one of your paintings.

592
00:48:03.590 --> 00:48:05.180
Hold up!

593
00:48:07.290 --> 00:48:09.990
Where is it?

594
00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:18.230
There. On top of the peak.

595
00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:20.100
- Come on.
- Hold it.

596
00:48:22.170 --> 00:48:24.300
Looks like a winding route to me.

597
00:48:26.310 --> 00:48:29.470
The fastest way is
straight up the east face.

598
00:48:29.550 --> 00:48:32.610
Ot course, there are only 12 guys
in the world who could do it.

599
00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:34.310
You want to try it?

600
00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:21.850
Gabe. What's happened?

601
00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:24.790
Oh, my God. You're frozen.
Come sit down.

602
00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:28.960
Gabe, where's your pack, your sweater?
Talk to me. What happened?

603
00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:30.500
They got Hal.

604
00:50:30.570 --> 00:50:33.160
The distress call was a fake.

605
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:37.070
Fake? What do you mean
it was fake?

606
00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:40.970
Before they crashed,
they dumped cases of money.

607
00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:43.070
- Who's they?
- I don't know.

608
00:50:43.150 --> 00:50:46.510
They're using Hal to find it.
When they do, he's dead.

609
00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:49.410
You gotta get on the radio
and call Frank...

610
00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:53.320
and tell him to call
the state police.

611
00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:56.320
The cold killed my radio,
but Frank's gonna be looking tor me.

612
00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:59.090
- We'll contact them from the chopper.
- The sun goes down in an hour.

613
00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:01.100
What do you want me to do?

614
00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:04.600
Let's take everything we need.
Let's move.

615
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:07.030
We got to get to that next case
before they do.

616
00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:14.070
We're close!

617
00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:17.080
- It's just up there!
- It better be.

618
00:51:18.350 --> 00:51:22.150
You know something? I'm getting
real tucking tired of your threats.

619
00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:23.810
Are you?

620
00:52:01.290 --> 00:52:02.880
It's there.

621
00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:18.300
Oh, my God. What do we do now?

622
00:52:18.370 --> 00:52:19.970
You got a pencil?

623
00:53:03.050 --> 00:53:04.640
Over here.

624
00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:28.030
Goddamn.

625
00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:32.540
The son of a bitch
is still alive!

626
00:53:38.650 --> 00:53:41.050
I'm beginning to dislike
this Mr. Walker.

627
00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:46.090
He can't be far. Find him. Go.

628
00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:09.980
Go.

629
00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:50.990
Come on.

630
00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:06.970
Give me a flare.

631
00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:10.480
- Meet me at Eagle's Cape.
- I'm not leaving.

632
00:55:10.550 --> 00:55:12.480
Don't worry about me!

633
00:56:32.890 --> 00:56:34.830
Gravity's a bitch, isn't it?

634
00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:37.230
Fuck the money, and fuck you!

635
00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:39.820
I wasn't born to die
on a mountain.

636
00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:42.200
Where were you born to die?
Got a place picked out?

637
00:56:42.270 --> 00:56:44.930
I don't need to hear
that shit from you, boy.

638
00:56:45.010 --> 00:56:47.840
Maybe this boy should make
this big mouth bigger.

639
00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:49.930
Stop this!

640
00:56:50.010 --> 00:56:52.740
The fight's not here.
It's out there.

641
00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:58.850
Find us some shelter.

642
00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:09.830
Next time you're, like,
watching MTV, you know...

643
00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:13.270
take a split second
and flip it to the Weather Channel.

644
00:57:13.330 --> 00:57:16.330
I mean, hey, where would you
rather be right now?

645
00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:19.700
Here in tent city, or at home
playing some righteous air hockey?

646
00:57:19.770 --> 00:57:21.710
Air hockey's definitely
got my vote.

647
00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:24.710
Exactly, cheesehead, exactly.

648
00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:26.710
- Cheesehead?
- Cheesehead.

649
00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:34.390
- He was here.
- What was in there?

650
00:57:34.460 --> 00:57:36.620
Answer the man.

651
00:57:36.690 --> 00:57:39.960
- Nothing. Just tourist souvenirs.
- Or equipment.

652
00:57:40.030 --> 00:57:42.930
Maybe Walker plans
to look after his friend here.

653
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.970
He's not my triend...

654
00:57:45.030 --> 00:57:48.330
and I don't like him
any more than I do you.

655
00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:50.530
Nice try.

656
00:57:50.610 --> 00:57:54.370
But I never underestimate the power
of loyalty when it comes naturally.

657
00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:58.410
Not like the kind
that has to be paid tor.

658
00:57:59.950 --> 00:58:01.280
Make a tire.

659
00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:07.140
It costs a fortune
to heat this place.

660
00:58:09.690 --> 00:58:11.630
That's bad humor, I know.

661
00:58:19.700 --> 00:58:22.670
We better get some sleep.
We're gonna need it.

662
00:58:36.020 --> 00:58:38.610
Rescue units, come in.

663
00:58:38.690 --> 00:58:41.750
Again, do you read? Come in.

664
00:58:41.820 --> 00:58:45.020
What the hell
is going on up there?

665
00:58:45.090 --> 00:58:46.390
Hal.

666
00:58:46.460 --> 00:58:49.430
Jessie, do you read?

667
00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:53.130
Jessie. It looks as if
we're drawing a crowd.

668
00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:56.190
We're down to a few hours before
the whole tucking world shows up.

669
00:58:56.270 --> 00:58:58.210
- Where's the next one?
- On the tower.

670
00:58:58.270 --> 00:58:59.710
How far?

671
00:59:00.980 --> 00:59:03.880
He asked how far, goddamn it!

672
00:59:03.950 --> 00:59:08.140
You know what I think? I think
you've been taking the scenic route.

673
00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:10.380
How far is it?

674
00:59:10.450 --> 00:59:12.440
Halt a day.

675
00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:15.890
- It's half a day.
- Hey, Hal!

676
00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:19.650
Check it out, man. It's Hal.
Hey, man, you stuck up here too?

677
00:59:19.730 --> 00:59:22.290
- You missed a great jump yesterday.
- Walk over.

678
00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:24.990
For Christ's sakes, man,
they're just kids.

679
00:59:25.070 --> 00:59:28.000
- Why don't you let them go?
- We're not animals.

680
00:59:28.070 --> 00:59:31.230
Don't force us to be. Walk over.

681
00:59:32.310 --> 00:59:35.330
Hey, man, was that storm
a real bummer or what?

682
00:59:35.410 --> 00:59:37.340
Me and him were
in tent city last night.

683
00:59:38.410 --> 00:59:40.210
- Yeah.
- Hey, Hal.

684
00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:43.310
We're gonna take one last jump
and split.

685
00:59:43.380 --> 00:59:45.110
You baby-sitting hikers?

686
00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:49.750
- Run, man, run!
- What?

687
00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:51.380
Get the hell out--

688
01:00:20.290 --> 01:00:22.550
Son of a bitch.
You didn't have to kill him!

689
01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:24.090
Shut up!

690
01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:27.020
Sue me.

691
01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:31.730
Fuck.

692
01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:03.960
Shoot him!

693
01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:06.770
Shoot him!

694
01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:09.700
You're letting him get away!
Shoot him!

695
01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:32.330
Shit. Ow!

696
01:01:37.170 --> 01:01:38.720
You murdering motherfuck.

697
01:01:39.830 --> 01:01:42.060
Kill a few people,
they call you a murderer.

698
01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:46.170
Kill a million,
and you're a conqueror.

699
01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:48.070
Go figure.

700
01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:51.310
Move on, Tucker. Time is short.

701
01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:39.690
Okay. Just like you said.

702
01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:42.230
He's taking them the long way around.

703
01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:45.230
To stay ahead of them, we're gonna
have to go through that crack.

704
01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:51.100
You said there was a way across.

705
01:02:51.170 --> 01:02:52.500
There is.

706
01:02:52.570 --> 01:02:54.370
- Where the fuck is it?
- There.

707
01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:55.880
You blind?

708
01:02:58.650 --> 01:03:01.810
Hell with the money.
Radio the chopper.

709
01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:05.720
You just don't get it, do you?

710
01:03:05.790 --> 01:03:10.020
We're in bed now, joined at the hip,
partners in crime.

711
01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:16.150
You've crossed over, Travers,
and there's no crossing back.

712
01:03:38.690 --> 01:03:41.050
All right, that'll keep it dry.

713
01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:51.520
Okay, let's do it.

714
01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:57.660
Get a good tooting.

715
01:03:59.270 --> 01:04:01.240
Okay.

716
01:04:07.350 --> 01:04:09.280
It's slick, Jess.

717
01:04:12.590 --> 01:04:14.780
Good foothold.

718
01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:50.380
Jessie, don't move.

719
01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:54.890
Oh, my God.

720
01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:59.360
- Let's get out of here.
- No!

721
01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:03.640
Jessie, you gotta get down!

722
01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:05.140
Come on!

723
01:05:07.110 --> 01:05:08.270
Get down!

724
01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:11.340
Stay close to me.

725
01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:18.050
All right, get down.

726
01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:19.350
Hold on to me.

727
01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:23.150
It's on my back!

728
01:05:30.570 --> 01:05:32.060
Let's get out!

729
01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:36.670
It's off your back.
There's nothing on your back.

730
01:05:36.740 --> 01:05:38.200
It's okay.

731
01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:45.840
Rocky Mountain Rescue Center,
this is Rescue 3. Over.

732
01:05:47.350 --> 01:05:50.040
Rescue 3, this is Rescue Center.
Go ahead.

733
01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:54.210
The vis is good. I've got
at least 20 miles in all directions.

734
01:05:54.290 --> 01:05:57.090
If anyone's out here,
I'll find them. Over.

735
01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:59.130
Roger, 3. Center out.

736
01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:12.570
Center, this is 3.

737
01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:16.080
I've picked up a signal on the thermal
imager just north of Comb Bluff.

738
01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:18.110
Landing to investigate.

739
01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:08.250
Get out! Get out of here!

740
01:07:09.930 --> 01:07:12.420
Get the hell out!

741
01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.440
Jesus Christ.

742
01:07:22.010 --> 01:07:25.100
Here, I got you. I got you.

743
01:07:25.180 --> 01:07:28.270
I got you, son. I got you.

744
01:07:28.350 --> 01:07:30.780
There's the opening.

745
01:07:30.850 --> 01:07:33.680
When I get up there,
I'll hook up the line...

746
01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:35.520
and you follow me up.

747
01:07:35.590 --> 01:07:38.110
- Okay?
- All right.

748
01:07:46.670 --> 01:07:49.970
- The other one is following.
- I'll move to a high point, flank him.

749
01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:52.440
Don't kill him
until you get the money.

750
01:07:52.510 --> 01:07:53.940
Sure.

751
01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:01.880
Mr. Wright, we found the I.D.
on the dead pilot.

752
01:08:01.950 --> 01:08:04.110
He was known to fly for Qualen.
Over.

753
01:08:04.190 --> 01:08:06.480
What about the Treasury jet?
Over.

754
01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:08.580
Its wreckage is scattered
over a two-mile area.

755
01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:10.950
No bodies have been found. Over.

756
01:08:11.030 --> 01:08:15.020
Finally. An F.A.A. satellite
has located a downed aircraft.

757
01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:19.120
Head 110 miles south-southwest
of the park entrance.

758
01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:22.530
Treasury Control, get
the rescue people on their way.

759
01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:24.940
We're headed straight there.
One out.

760
01:08:25.010 --> 01:08:26.400
Center out.

761
01:08:51.670 --> 01:08:54.030
I got it, Jess.

762
01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:56.800
We're almost out.
I can chop through.

763
01:09:25.070 --> 01:09:26.400
Jessie, come on up!

764
01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:27.900
Okay!

765
01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:35.540
Walker.

766
01:09:35.610 --> 01:09:38.340
Small world, ain't it?

767
01:09:38.410 --> 01:09:40.440
Don't even think about it.

768
01:09:41.980 --> 01:09:43.950
Your life's on sale, Walker.

769
01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:45.780
The price is 30 million.

770
01:09:45.850 --> 01:09:48.580
- Where is it?
- It's gone.

771
01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:52.660
What the fuck are you talking about?
Where's the money?

772
01:09:52.730 --> 01:09:55.590
I burned it.
Never could save anything.

773
01:09:56.600 --> 01:10:00.470
Not even a dumb mountain boy like you
would burn $30 million.

774
01:10:01.270 --> 01:10:03.960
I don't make deals, Walker,
but I'll make one with you.

775
01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:07.600
Hand over the money, and I'll
just kill you and not the girl.

776
01:10:09.010 --> 01:10:10.410
Give me the money!

777
01:10:14.010 --> 01:10:16.310
Gabe?

778
01:10:18.090 --> 01:10:19.520
All right.

779
01:10:35.870 --> 01:10:38.500
Come on. Come on!

780
01:10:38.570 --> 01:10:40.040
- Can you walk?
- Yeah.

781
01:10:40.110 --> 01:10:42.130
Kynette, what's going on?
Where's the money?

782
01:10:43.810 --> 01:10:46.210
- He said he torched it.
- Where is he now?

783
01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:47.870
He dropped down into some cave.

784
01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:50.850
You've had your chance.
Move it out now.

785
01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:52.720
- Kristel, get the C-4.
- Roger.

786
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:54.780
Just give me five minutes.

787
01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:57.620
I said get the fuck out of there.

788
01:10:57.690 --> 01:11:00.850
Good. And blow up that black bastard
while you're at it.

789
01:11:00.930 --> 01:11:03.490
Save me the time
of doing it myself.

790
01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:26.080
It you want me, I'll be here!

791
01:11:31.690 --> 01:11:33.630
I'm in here!

792
01:11:45.710 --> 01:11:47.640
I'm in here.

793
01:11:52.710 --> 01:11:54.340
You're making it too easy tor me.

794
01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:20.460
No bullets, bitch!

795
01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:33.610
Now, I'm gonna ask you just three times:
where's the money?

796
01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:38.590
Sissy.

797
01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:40.250
You hit like a sissy.

798
01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:45.730
Wrong answer, motherfucker!

799
01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:50.140
Get up!

800
01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:53.170
Now, I'm gonna ask you
for a second time.

801
01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:55.730
Where is the money?

802
01:12:56.810 --> 01:12:58.780
Burned it.

803
01:12:58.850 --> 01:13:00.810
Wrong answer!

804
01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:12.290
Time to kill a mountain man.

805
01:13:17.300 --> 01:13:21.290
It amazes me, in this day and age,
when a man...

806
01:13:21.370 --> 01:13:23.430
will put money...

807
01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:25.730
before the personal safety...

808
01:13:25.810 --> 01:13:29.040
of himself and his bitch.

809
01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:35.970
At least you can go
to your grave knowing...

810
01:13:36.050 --> 01:13:38.350
that I'm gonna treat the bitch...

811
01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:41.050
right!

812
01:13:59.770 --> 01:14:03.070
Are you okay? Oh, God!
I thought he killed you!

813
01:14:04.310 --> 01:14:07.140
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm all right.

814
01:14:10.220 --> 01:14:13.210
Hal, Jessie, do you read?

815
01:14:13.290 --> 01:14:15.410
Again, do you read? Come in.

816
01:14:17.390 --> 01:14:19.660
Hal, Jessie, what the hell's
goin' on up there?

817
01:14:19.730 --> 01:14:21.990
Jessie, find it.

818
01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:36.770
It's ready.

819
01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:40.410
Rescue 1, Rescue 2.

820
01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:42.950
- Do you copy? Over.
- Here it is!

821
01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:46.080
I found Evan in the east valley.

822
01:14:46.150 --> 01:14:48.090
He's got a gunshot wound
in the back.

823
01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:51.720
He's en route to the medical center
in Granby in critical condition.

824
01:14:51.790 --> 01:14:55.420
In case you can hear this,
I'm resuming my search.

825
01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:56.690
Come on!

826
01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:02.130
You'll make somebody
a fine wife someday.

827
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:06.240
You should see me bake a cake.

828
01:15:20.050 --> 01:15:23.420
He's still alive,
tor another four minutes.

829
01:15:23.490 --> 01:15:26.390
- Where's it set?
- Primed to go oft right over his head.

830
01:15:27.260 --> 01:15:29.320
Fuck!

831
01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:33.060
Gabe, three minutes!
There's a bomb!

832
01:15:33.130 --> 01:15:36.570
Get the hell out of there!
There's a bomb over your head!

833
01:15:39.470 --> 01:15:41.840
Jessie, get the gear!

834
01:15:48.350 --> 01:15:51.280
Come on, Jessie. This way.

835
01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:54.150
That charge is gonna cause a landslide.
We gotta get to the west face.

836
01:15:58.090 --> 01:16:00.290
Why the hell are we wasting time?

837
01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:03.190
Making sure he's not
going to find that last case.

838
01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.940
You want to kill me,
don't you, Tucker?

839
01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:13.500
Well, take a number
and get in line.

840
01:16:18.210 --> 01:16:21.310
The ledge is too far. Take this rope
and pull it apart and tie it together.

841
01:16:21.380 --> 01:16:23.610
- We're gonna rappel down.
- This rope is 60 years old.

842
01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:25.520
- Will it hold?
- Don't think so.

843
01:16:25.590 --> 01:16:26.710
Bad answer.

844
01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:43.670
Frank! Frank!

845
01:16:45.510 --> 01:16:48.270
- No, Frank!
- He can't see you.

846
01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:50.240
Go!

847
01:17:05.530 --> 01:17:08.720
Here comes our ride. Move.

848
01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:13.020
Okay, now, swing as hard
as you can. Push!

849
01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:02.070
Jump.

850
01:18:58.740 --> 01:19:01.640
Frank! Frank! Frank!

851
01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:38.810
What's happening here?
Where's the rest of the group?

852
01:19:40.450 --> 01:19:42.070
Welcome.

853
01:19:42.150 --> 01:19:43.670
What are you doing?

854
01:19:43.750 --> 01:19:45.510
Now, back off!

855
01:19:46.790 --> 01:19:48.720
I came here to help you.

856
01:19:48.790 --> 01:19:50.850
You did.

857
01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:52.650
Don't move.

858
01:19:57.030 --> 01:19:59.120
- Frank! Frank!
- Better hurry, Tucker.

859
01:20:01.270 --> 01:20:02.700
Get out of here!

860
01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:27.690
You stupid maniac!

861
01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:31.130
- No one told you to shoot.
- We've wasted enough time.

862
01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:32.630
Frank?

863
01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:49.110
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

864
01:20:56.290 --> 01:20:58.780
This man never hurt anybody!

865
01:21:00.190 --> 01:21:02.250
Touching.

866
01:21:02.330 --> 01:21:04.700
Kristel, check the chopper.
Let's go.

867
01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:34.860
Get back! Get back!

868
01:21:34.930 --> 01:21:37.800
Go! Jessie, run!

869
01:21:56.750 --> 01:21:58.680
That son of a bitch.

870
01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:04.150
All right. We use a chopper
to locate the third case.

871
01:22:04.220 --> 01:22:07.090
- Then we get the hell out of here.
- No.

872
01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:09.320
There's not enough fuel
to search around.

873
01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:11.260
Just enough to get us down.

874
01:22:11.330 --> 01:22:13.700
You're not running things,
Travers.

875
01:22:14.770 --> 01:22:17.700
As soon as he finds the money,
you're as dead as me.

876
01:22:19.710 --> 01:22:22.440
Give me the monitor.

877
01:22:22.510 --> 01:22:23.870
Now.

878
01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:40.820
- What's the code, Travers?
- I told you, Qualen.

879
01:22:40.890 --> 01:22:44.160
Fifty thousand possible
key code combinations...

880
01:22:44.230 --> 01:22:46.160
in 15-second intervals.

881
01:22:46.970 --> 01:22:49.530
So, what's the fucking code?

882
01:22:56.640 --> 01:22:59.080
Well, look
what Agent Travers found.

883
01:22:59.150 --> 01:23:01.080
I guess he is running things
after all.

884
01:23:01.150 --> 01:23:03.120
Isn't he?

885
01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:07.910
So what's the plan, Travers?
We use the chopper to find the money.

886
01:23:07.990 --> 01:23:09.080
Right?

887
01:23:10.190 --> 01:23:12.890
What a good idea.

888
01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:15.550
But then again...

889
01:23:15.630 --> 01:23:18.530
without a pilot...

890
01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:21.000
nobody even gets off
this mountain.

891
01:23:22.340 --> 01:23:24.270
What are you doing, Eric?

892
01:23:25.570 --> 01:23:28.740
Do you know what
real love is, Kristel?

893
01:23:32.350 --> 01:23:33.780
Sacrifice.

894
01:23:45.930 --> 01:23:48.690
Now I'm the only one
who can fly us out of here.

895
01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:50.890
We're partners again.

896
01:23:52.030 --> 01:23:54.830
Now, take your toy...

897
01:23:54.900 --> 01:23:57.200
and find our money.

898
01:23:59.510 --> 01:24:01.170
Radio when you find it.

899
01:24:03.380 --> 01:24:05.310
I'm waiting here.

900
01:24:14.250 --> 01:24:16.650
All right, the last of the money's
at Crockett River.

901
01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:18.990
If we take the northern ridge,
we can get there first.

902
01:24:19.060 --> 01:24:22.890
There is no "we." I'm gonna go along
the north trail to Bitker Ladder.

903
01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:24.990
You go on to the station
tor help.

904
01:24:25.070 --> 01:24:28.560
- Are you crazy?
- It they find the money, Hal's dead.

905
01:24:28.640 --> 01:24:30.800
- Just get back there fast.
- All right.

906
01:24:30.870 --> 01:24:34.530
Roger, Control. But where the hell
are those National Guard choppers?

907
01:24:34.610 --> 01:24:36.800
They had a mechanical, sir.
It's being worked on now.

908
01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:40.040
- Their E.T.A. is one hour.
- An hour?

909
01:24:40.110 --> 01:24:43.010
You got to do better than that.
Now, get a move on. Out.

910
01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:09.800
Stop there.

911
01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:15.670
We're close.

912
01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:18.510
I got it locked in.

913
01:26:18.580 --> 01:26:21.780
So we're finished
with him, yeah?

914
01:26:21.850 --> 01:26:24.340
Yeah. Do it quietly.

915
01:26:24.420 --> 01:26:26.750
Your insane boss
just made enough noise...

916
01:26:26.820 --> 01:26:29.450
tor anyone within ten miles
to hear us.

917
01:26:32.430 --> 01:26:34.360
It's been fun.

918
01:26:39.770 --> 01:26:41.700
Hey, Delmar.

919
01:26:42.770 --> 01:26:45.470
From me to you...

920
01:26:45.540 --> 01:26:48.030
you're an asshole.

921
01:26:48.110 --> 01:26:49.600
Yeah?

922
01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:52.580
And you're a loudmouth,
punk slag...

923
01:26:52.650 --> 01:26:55.170
who's about to die.

924
01:26:55.250 --> 01:26:56.340
Maybe.

925
01:26:57.950 --> 01:27:00.940
But in a minute I'll be dead.

926
01:27:01.020 --> 01:27:02.890
You...

927
01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:04.820
will always be an asshole.

928
01:27:04.890 --> 01:27:07.950
So go ahead and shoot.

929
01:27:08.030 --> 01:27:09.790
I'm getting cold.

930
01:27:13.830 --> 01:27:15.360
Shoot!

931
01:27:17.770 --> 01:27:19.360
Who's shooting?

932
01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:27.040
Tell me...

933
01:27:27.110 --> 01:27:29.380
do you like soccer?

934
01:27:29.450 --> 01:27:30.970
It's a great sport.

935
01:27:31.050 --> 01:27:35.850
I was a fucking good striker.
Isn't that something?

936
01:27:46.430 --> 01:27:49.060
Oh, God!

937
01:27:49.140 --> 01:27:50.470
Fuck you!

938
01:27:50.540 --> 01:27:52.560
Ah, you're swearing now.

939
01:27:54.170 --> 01:27:57.570
That's a penalty kick
for unsportsmanlike.

940
01:28:02.750 --> 01:28:04.150
A lovely little chip shot.

941
01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:09.520
He dribbles past one defender...

942
01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:11.920
two defenders...

943
01:28:11.990 --> 01:28:13.420
three defenders.

944
01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:23.360
Striker lines up
at the penalty spot.

945
01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:25.560
He focuses on the ball.

946
01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:27.570
The crowd is on its feet.

947
01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:30.110
Striker moves to his left.

948
01:28:30.180 --> 01:28:32.410
He draws back his foot.

949
01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:33.780
He comes in.

950
01:28:53.770 --> 01:28:55.830
Season's over, asshole!

951
01:29:03.710 --> 01:29:06.340
I said quietly.

952
01:29:38.310 --> 01:29:40.840
What the fuck is going on?

953
01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:44.850
This is not right.

954
01:29:59.430 --> 01:30:00.870
Fuck!

955
01:30:19.390 --> 01:30:21.410
Goddamn.

956
01:30:21.490 --> 01:30:23.850
Fuck you, Walker!

957
01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:29.820
Fucker!

958
01:30:37.940 --> 01:30:40.030
Goddamn it!

959
01:30:43.780 --> 01:30:45.740
Come in, goddamn it.

960
01:30:48.010 --> 01:30:49.950
Have you got what we need?

961
01:30:50.020 --> 01:30:53.420
It's Walker. The son of a bitch
is still alive, Qualen.

962
01:30:53.490 --> 01:30:55.420
No names. This is an open line.

963
01:30:55.490 --> 01:30:58.010
I don't give a shit,
Eric Qualen!

964
01:30:59.660 --> 01:31:01.630
Had to be insane to tie up...

965
01:31:01.690 --> 01:31:04.750
with a lowlife piece of shit
like you anyway.

966
01:31:04.830 --> 01:31:05.920
They beat us.

967
01:31:07.330 --> 01:31:11.060
A couple of fucking
mountain rangers beat us.

968
01:31:11.140 --> 01:31:15.040
Jesus Christ, that's Travers.
Get a bead on that frequency.

969
01:31:15.110 --> 01:31:18.410
They beat the man
no law agency ever could.

970
01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:19.740
Get off the radio.

971
01:31:19.810 --> 01:31:22.750
And I'm finding that
pretty fuckin' hilarious, Qualen.

972
01:31:22.820 --> 01:31:25.050
Stop transmitting,
you stupid bastard!

973
01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:28.140
It's hard to believe I sold out
after 20 years...

974
01:31:28.220 --> 01:31:30.660
and this is my payback?

975
01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:34.220
To run on a mountain
with a fuckin' dirtbag like you!

976
01:31:34.290 --> 01:31:36.420
Travers, you've lost your mind.

977
01:31:37.530 --> 01:31:39.730
Lost it. Have I lost it?

978
01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:43.530
Fuckin' A, I've lost it, Qualen!
Pure, fuckin' section eight!

979
01:31:45.470 --> 01:31:47.560
I gotta go.

980
01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:50.370
I'm on my last official manhunt.

981
01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:53.380
Adios, mothertucker!

982
01:32:01.150 --> 01:32:03.210
You got a bearing
on that frequency yet?

983
01:32:04.420 --> 01:32:07.120
Yes. Eight minutes away.

984
01:32:25.410 --> 01:32:27.350
You're dead, Walker!

985
01:33:23.100 --> 01:33:24.300
Frank!

986
01:35:02.870 --> 01:35:04.340
I won, Walker!

987
01:35:22.620 --> 01:35:24.050
Gabe!

988
01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:48.410
Travers, come in.

989
01:35:53.550 --> 01:35:56.920
Compliments of Delmar.
Too late. You missed him.

990
01:35:56.990 --> 01:35:59.580
He decided to take a swim
to Arizona.

991
01:35:59.660 --> 01:36:02.530
- Tucker.
- That's right.

992
01:36:03.460 --> 01:36:05.620
Congratulations.

993
01:36:05.700 --> 01:36:06.790
Qualen?

994
01:36:08.100 --> 01:36:10.030
It's all over.

995
01:36:10.100 --> 01:36:13.230
Walker. You resilient bastard.

996
01:36:13.310 --> 01:36:16.000
So you're still alive.

997
01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:18.200
I want that money,
and I want it now.

998
01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:20.750
Qualen, the game's over.

999
01:36:20.810 --> 01:36:21.910
You lost.

1000
01:36:21.980 --> 01:36:25.140
Oh, no. The game's
just getting interesting.

1001
01:36:25.220 --> 01:36:27.190
I'm airborne now, you see.

1002
01:36:28.890 --> 01:36:31.690
As a matter of tact,
I've picked up a passenger...

1003
01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:33.490
you might be interested in.

1004
01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:37.760
Go on, talk.

1005
01:36:37.830 --> 01:36:40.060
I said talk, goddamn it!

1006
01:36:42.070 --> 01:36:44.900
Hal, he's got me. I'm sorry.
I thought he was Frank.

1007
01:36:44.970 --> 01:36:47.060
You get the picture, Walker?

1008
01:36:47.140 --> 01:36:49.660
Now, I want that money.

1009
01:36:49.740 --> 01:36:52.610
Meet me at the highest point
from where you are.

1010
01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:55.370
It you don't,
we're going to find out...

1011
01:36:55.450 --> 01:36:58.350
it this little angel of yours
can fly.

1012
01:36:59.550 --> 01:37:02.210
Jessie, take him to the highest point
near Bitker Ladder.

1013
01:37:02.290 --> 01:37:05.380
I'll meet you there.
Don't worry.

1014
01:37:05.460 --> 01:37:07.650
Love's a killer, isn't it?

1015
01:37:23.210 --> 01:37:26.410
- Where are you, Walker?
- You're getting warmer. Keep climbing.

1016
01:37:27.810 --> 01:37:29.580
You're getting closer.

1017
01:37:29.650 --> 01:37:31.620
Look out.

1018
01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:52.030
I must admit,
you're a real piece of work.

1019
01:37:52.100 --> 01:37:54.830
Yeah, and I must admit,
you're a real piece of shit.

1020
01:38:05.020 --> 01:38:06.990
Throw it up, or I'll kill her.

1021
01:38:07.050 --> 01:38:10.080
You do, and the cash is gone.

1022
01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:13.820
- The money.
- I want you to put her down.

1023
01:38:13.890 --> 01:38:15.330
Over there!

1024
01:39:09.380 --> 01:39:10.850
Jessie, run!

1025
01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:13.150
- What about you?
- Run!

1026
01:39:14.450 --> 01:39:15.890
Run!

1027
01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:19.020
Come on, Qualen.

1028
01:39:19.090 --> 01:39:22.250
I got what you want. Come on.

1029
01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:32.640
Come on. Come and get it.

1030
01:39:37.580 --> 01:39:39.510
Come on. Closer.

1031
01:39:40.580 --> 01:39:42.980
Come on, closer.

1032
01:39:43.050 --> 01:39:45.280
- A little closer, Qualen.
- Throw it in.

1033
01:39:45.350 --> 01:39:47.250
Bring it closer.

1034
01:39:48.350 --> 01:39:49.450
Oh, my God.

1035
01:39:56.760 --> 01:39:58.350
Throw it in.

1036
01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:17.450
Damn you, Walker!

1037
01:40:34.130 --> 01:40:35.290
Run!

1038
01:41:14.510 --> 01:41:17.070
Jessie, move!

1039
01:41:27.950 --> 01:41:29.050
Come on.

1040
01:42:09.030 --> 01:42:12.360
It's just us now,
you piece of shit.

1041
01:42:27.250 --> 01:42:29.580
Watch out!

1042
01:42:29.650 --> 01:42:31.620
Get out of there, man!

1043
01:42:35.620 --> 01:42:37.280
Stick around.

1044
01:42:40.990 --> 01:42:42.360
We had a deal...

1045
01:42:42.430 --> 01:42:44.900
and now we've
just got each other.

1046
01:42:46.100 --> 01:42:48.260
You're not afraid to die.

1047
01:42:53.710 --> 01:42:55.070
Come on, get him!

1048
01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:01.440
Get out of there!

1049
01:43:02.510 --> 01:43:03.980
Remember, shithead.

1050
01:43:04.050 --> 01:43:06.640
Keep your arms and legs
in the vehicle...

1051
01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:08.410
at all times!

1052
01:43:29.070 --> 01:43:31.070
Give me the rope!

1053
01:43:34.910 --> 01:43:36.350
Okay.

1054
01:43:40.290 --> 01:43:41.680
I'm out of here.

1055
01:44:04.540 --> 01:44:08.640
Gabe, buddy, you think you could have
put a little less effort in that climb?

1056
01:44:08.710 --> 01:44:11.410
I mean,
I thought you were in shape.

1057
01:44:12.780 --> 01:44:14.780
- I guess I'm just falling apart.
- Yeah.

1058
01:44:14.850 --> 01:44:16.550
This is Agent Wright. Copy?

1059
01:44:16.620 --> 01:44:20.320
- Yeah, copy.
- Please identify yourselves. Over.

1060
01:44:20.390 --> 01:44:22.990
Yeah, this is Hal Tucker,
Rocky Mountain Rescue.

1061
01:44:23.060 --> 01:44:25.720
Hey, we're glad to see you guys.

1062
01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:27.730
If you're looking
for Mr. Qualen...

1063
01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:30.860
try about 4,000 feet
south of here.

1064
01:44:30.940 --> 01:44:33.630
He'll be the one
wearing a helicopter. Over.

1065
01:44:33.710 --> 01:44:35.200
Good.

1066
01:44:35.270 --> 01:44:37.300
I'll arrange transportation
for the three of you...
