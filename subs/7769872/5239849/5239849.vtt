1
00:02:06.036 --> 00:02:07.292
We're not clear yet.

2
00:02:07.316 --> 00:02:09.784
There are still 30 pallets
of cannon shells in C bunker.

3
00:02:09.956 --> 00:02:11.868
Forget the munitions,
there is no time.

4
00:02:11.898 --> 00:02:13.710
Just get everyone on the transports.

5
00:02:13.796 --> 00:02:16.026
Oh, no.

6
00:02:28.036 --> 00:02:30.231
We've caught them in the
middle of their evacuation.

7
00:02:31.156 --> 00:02:34.592
I have my orders from
Supreme Leader Snoke himself.

8
00:02:34.796 --> 00:02:38.425
This is where we snuff out
the Resistance once and for all.

9
00:02:38.996 --> 00:02:41.635
Tell Captain Canady
to prime his dreadnought.

10
00:02:41.796 --> 00:02:47.314
Incinerate their base, destroy their
transports and obliterate their fleet.

11
00:03:02.276 --> 00:03:05.712
General, Resistance ship approaching.
Guns and shields in attack mode.

12
00:03:06.756 --> 00:03:09.145
A single light fighter.

13
00:03:18.596 --> 00:03:20.985
Happy beeps here, buddy, come on.

14
00:03:21.156 --> 00:03:22.372
We've pulled crazier stunts than this.

15
00:03:22.396 --> 00:03:24.432
Just for the record,
Commander Dameron,

16
00:03:24.636 --> 00:03:26.069
I'm with the droid on this one.

17
00:03:26.236 --> 00:03:28.113
Thank you for your support, General.

18
00:03:29.276 --> 00:03:30.425
Happy beeps.

19
00:03:31.596 --> 00:03:32.596
Attention.

20
00:03:32.676 --> 00:03:34.612
This is Commander Poe Dameron
of the Republic fleet,

21
00:03:34.636 --> 00:03:37.528
<i>I have an urgent
communiqu√© for General Hugs.</i>

22
00:03:37.796 --> 00:03:38.949
Patch him through.

23
00:03:39.476 --> 00:03:41.990
This is General Hux
of the First Order.

24
00:03:42.476 --> 00:03:44.467
The Republic is no more.

25
00:03:44.636 --> 00:03:47.867
Your fleet are Rebel scum
and war criminals.

26
00:03:48.076 --> 00:03:50.510
Tell your precious princess
there will be no terms,

27
00:03:50.676 --> 00:03:52.690
there will be no surrender.

28
00:03:54.476 --> 00:03:56.287
<i>Hi, I'm holding for General Hugs.</i>

29
00:03:56.556 --> 00:03:57.724
This is Hux.

30
00:03:57.725 --> 00:03:59.514
You and your friends are doomed.

31
00:03:59.716 --> 00:04:02.153
We will wipe your filth
from the galaxy.

32
00:04:03.676 --> 00:04:05.212
<i>Ok. I'll hold.</i>

33
00:04:06.396 --> 00:04:07.396
Hello?

34
00:04:07.756 --> 00:04:09.770
<i>Hello? Yup.
I'm still here.</i>

35
00:04:10.536 --> 00:04:12.154
Can you... Can he hear me?

36
00:04:12.916 --> 00:04:14.144
<i>Hugs?</i>
He can.

37
00:04:14.316 --> 00:04:17.247
<i>With an H. Skinny guy.
Kinda pasty.</i>

38
00:04:17.996 --> 00:04:21.033
I can hear you.
Can you hear me?

39
00:04:21.236 --> 00:04:22.996
Look, I can't hold forever.
If you reach him,

40
00:04:23.396 --> 00:04:25.908
<i>tell him Leia has
an urgent message for him...</i>

41
00:04:26.276 --> 00:04:28.351
I believe he's tooling with you, sir.

42
00:04:28.716 --> 00:04:29.968
<i>About his mother.</i>

43
00:04:30.836 --> 00:04:32.349
Open fire!

44
00:04:32.436 --> 00:04:34.052
BB-8, punch it!

45
00:04:43.876 --> 00:04:45.275
He's going for the dreadnought.

46
00:04:46.956 --> 00:04:48.071
He's insane.

47
00:04:51.116 --> 00:04:52.193
That's got a kick.

48
00:05:06.476 --> 00:05:08.353
Alright, taking out the cannons now.

49
00:05:08.436 --> 00:05:09.556
<i>Tallie, start your approach.</i>

50
00:05:09.596 --> 00:05:10.756
<i>Copy that.</i>

51
00:05:12.236 --> 00:05:13.340
<i>Captain Canady?</i>

52
00:05:13.341 --> 00:05:15.595
<i>Why aren't you blasting that puny ship?</i>

53
00:05:15.596 --> 00:05:18.156
That puny ship is too small
and at too close range.

54
00:05:18.316 --> 00:05:19.669
We need to scramble our fighters

55
00:05:20.156 --> 00:05:21.874
five bloody minutes ago.

56
00:05:22.036 --> 00:05:23.316
He'll never penetrate our armor.

57
00:05:23.396 --> 00:05:25.193
He's not trying to penetrate our armor.

58
00:05:25.396 --> 00:05:27.352
He's clearing out our surface cannons.

59
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:30.900
<i>One cannon left.</i>

60
00:05:31.116 --> 00:05:32.435
<i>And here comes the parade.</i>

61
00:05:38.076 --> 00:05:39.076
<i>Yeah! Yeah, I see him!</i>

62
00:05:44.896 --> 00:05:46.085
No, no, no.
Damn it!

63
00:05:46.476 --> 00:05:47.836
BB-8, my weapons systems are down.

64
00:05:47.956 --> 00:05:49.252
We gotta take out that last cannon

65
00:05:49.276 --> 00:05:50.345
or our bombers are toast.

66
00:05:50.516 --> 00:05:51.735
<i>Work your magic, buddy.</i>

67
00:06:07.396 --> 00:06:08.909
Are the auto-cannons primed?

68
00:06:09.076 --> 00:06:10.076
Primed and ready, sir.

69
00:06:10.236 --> 00:06:11.430
What are we waiting for?

70
00:06:11.836 --> 00:06:12.871
Fire on the base!

71
00:06:17.476 --> 00:06:18.476
Punch it!

72
00:06:26.836 --> 00:06:29.236
<i>The last transport is in the air.
The evacuation is complete.</i>

73
00:06:29.956 --> 00:06:30.984
You did it, Poe.

74
00:06:31.396 --> 00:06:34.493
Now get your squad back here
so we can get out of this place.

75
00:06:34.676 --> 00:06:35.745
No, General...

76
00:06:35.836 --> 00:06:37.394
<i>We can do this.
We have the chance</i>

77
00:06:37.556 --> 00:06:38.725
to take out a dreadnought.

78
00:06:42.676 --> 00:06:44.268
<i>These things are fleet killers.</i>

79
00:06:44.436 --> 00:06:45.476
<i>We can't let it get away.</i>

80
00:06:45.516 --> 00:06:46.710
Disengage now...

81
00:06:46.876 --> 00:06:49.574
<i>Commander.
That is an or...</i>

82
00:06:55.136 --> 00:06:58.487
Wipe that nervous expression
off your face, Threepio.

83
00:06:59.216 --> 00:07:01.389
Well, I will certainly try, General.

84
00:07:01.956 --> 00:07:03.105
Nervous?

85
00:07:05.916 --> 00:07:07.535
Let's go, BB-8.

86
00:07:07.536 --> 00:07:08.651
It's now or never!

87
00:07:32.236 --> 00:07:34.252
<i>Yes!</i>

88
00:07:36.236 --> 00:07:37.888
All clear! Bring the bombs.

89
00:07:38.076 --> 00:07:39.076
Captain,

90
00:07:39.716 --> 00:07:41.413
Resistance bombers approaching.

91
00:07:41.916 --> 00:07:42.985
Of course they are.

92
00:07:56.076 --> 00:07:57.476
<i>Bombers, keep that tight formation.</i>

93
00:07:57.596 --> 00:07:59.232
<i>Fighters, protect the bombers.</i>

94
00:07:59.496 --> 00:08:01.332
<i>It's not every day we
get a shot at a dreadnought,</i>

95
00:08:01.356 --> 00:08:02.391
<i>so let's make this count.</i>

96
00:08:02.516 --> 00:08:03.551
<i>Copy that, Blue Leader.</i>

97
00:08:03.716 --> 00:08:05.666
You get us there, we'll give it to them.

98
00:08:05.756 --> 00:08:06.790
<i>Copy. We're on it.</i>

99
00:08:06.791 --> 00:08:07.756
Fighters incoming.

100
00:08:09.836 --> 00:08:11.149
<i>Gunners, look alive.</i>

101
00:08:13.516 --> 00:08:14.692
<i>Snubfighters at two-ten!</i>

102
00:08:14.716 --> 00:08:15.852
<i>They're coming in!
Form up!</i>

103
00:08:15.876 --> 00:08:17.275
They're everywhere!

104
00:08:17.676 --> 00:08:18.676
Here they come.

105
00:08:18.756 --> 00:08:19.812
Incoming fighters.
Form up.

106
00:08:19.836 --> 00:08:21.236
Vector in at attack speed.

107
00:08:21.276 --> 00:08:22.994
Pull up!
Flank right.

108
00:08:24.236 --> 00:08:26.830
Mayday! Mayday!
Mayday! We're going down!

109
00:08:27.316 --> 00:08:28.986
Recharge the auto-cannons.

110
00:08:29.836 --> 00:08:31.454
Target their cruiser.

111
00:08:37.196 --> 00:08:38.031
I see it.

112
00:08:38.032 --> 00:08:39.366
Tallie, they've targeted

113
00:08:39.436 --> 00:08:41.074
<i>the fleet and begun
the priming sequence.</i>

114
00:08:41.236 --> 00:08:42.236
<i>Copy that.</i>

115
00:08:42.436 --> 00:08:43.436
<i>We're almost there.</i>

116
00:08:44.916 --> 00:08:47.208
<i>Bombardiers, begin your drop sequence.</i>

117
00:08:54.276 --> 00:08:55.936
<i>I've got a visual on the target.</i>

118
00:08:56.116 --> 00:08:57.850
<i>We're approaching the sweet spot.</i>

119
00:09:00.796 --> 00:09:02.876
<i>Bombs are armed.</i>

120
00:09:25.516 --> 00:09:26.673
Auto-cannons aimed.

121
00:09:26.674 --> 00:09:28.110
Forty seconds to full charge.

122
00:09:28.276 --> 00:09:30.376
Destroy that last bomber!

123
00:09:35.756 --> 00:09:37.032
<i>Paige, come in.</i>

124
00:09:37.033 --> 00:09:38.229
<i>We're over the target.</i>

125
00:09:38.336 --> 00:09:39.792
<i>Why aren't your bay doors open?</i>

126
00:09:39.916 --> 00:09:42.091
<i>You're the only bomber left.
It's all down to you!</i>

127
00:09:51.516 --> 00:09:52.915
Nix!
<i>Paige!</i>

128
00:09:53.076 --> 00:09:54.907
Drop the payload now!

129
00:10:04.196 --> 00:10:05.196
Look out!

130
00:10:07.076 --> 00:10:08.304
No!

131
00:11:10.156 --> 00:11:11.305
<i>Bombs away!</i>

132
00:11:38.836 --> 00:11:40.952
Direct hit! Dreadnought down!

133
00:12:15.056 --> 00:12:16.852
General, Supreme Leader Snoke

134
00:12:16.853 --> 00:12:18.592
is making contact from his ship.

135
00:12:20.756 --> 00:12:21.756
Excellent.

136
00:12:22.876 --> 00:12:24.915
I'll take it in my chambers.

137
00:12:26.276 --> 00:12:28.610
General Hux.

138
00:12:30.196 --> 00:12:31.157
Good.

139
00:12:31.158 --> 00:12:32.288
Supreme Lea...

140
00:12:35.636 --> 00:12:38.538
<i>My disappointment
in your performance,</i>

141
00:12:38.539 --> 00:12:41.372
<i>cannot be overstated.</i>

142
00:12:41.636 --> 00:12:43.686
They can't get away,
Supreme Leader.

143
00:12:44.876 --> 00:12:47.652
We have them tied
on the end of a string.

144
00:12:59.196 --> 00:13:00.311
Rey!

145
00:13:16.956 --> 00:13:18.055
Well done, pal.

146
00:13:22.076 --> 00:13:24.279
Finn naked leaking bag? What?

147
00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:25.448
Did you fry a chip?

148
00:13:32.516 --> 00:13:34.234
Finn! Finn, buddy.

149
00:13:35.116 --> 00:13:36.469
It's so good to see you.

150
00:13:36.636 --> 00:13:37.671
What? Let's...

151
00:13:37.876 --> 00:13:40.213
We need to get you dressed.
Come on.

152
00:13:41.076 --> 00:13:42.452
You must have a thousand questions.

153
00:13:42.476 --> 00:13:43.550
Where's Rey?

154
00:14:46.716 --> 00:14:48.154
Master Skywalker?

155
00:15:12.316 --> 00:15:13.727
Master Skywalker?

156
00:15:15.876 --> 00:15:17.314
I'm from the Resistance.

157
00:15:17.315 --> 00:15:18.493
Your sister Leia sent me.

158
00:15:18.494 --> 00:15:19.754
We need your help.

159
00:15:29.316 --> 00:15:30.588
Hello?

160
00:16:02.316 --> 00:16:03.695
Go away.

161
00:16:10.596 --> 00:16:12.075
Chewie, what are you doing here?

162
00:16:12.836 --> 00:16:14.236
He said you're coming back with us.

163
00:16:14.456 --> 00:16:15.456
How did you find me?

164
00:16:15.616 --> 00:16:17.288
Long story.
We'll tell you on the Falcon.

165
00:16:18.396 --> 00:16:19.449
Falcon?

166
00:16:22.356 --> 00:16:23.356
Wait.

167
00:16:27.076 --> 00:16:28.387
Where's Han?

168
00:16:34.076 --> 00:16:37.910
Tied on a string indeed,
General Hux. Well done.

169
00:16:38.176 --> 00:16:41.373
The Resistance will soon
be in our grasp.

170
00:16:41.476 --> 00:16:43.471
Thank you, Supreme Leader.

171
00:16:51.276 --> 00:16:54.675
You wonder why I keep a rabid cur,

172
00:16:54.676 --> 00:16:57.186
in such a place of power?

173
00:16:57.756 --> 00:16:59.738
A cur's weakness,

174
00:16:59.739 --> 00:17:01.310
properly manipulated,

175
00:17:01.876 --> 00:17:04.885
can be a sharp tool.

176
00:17:07.556 --> 00:17:09.228
How's your wound?

177
00:17:10.436 --> 00:17:11.585
<i>It's nothing.</i>

178
00:17:15.116 --> 00:17:18.265
The mighty Kylo Ren.

179
00:17:19.596 --> 00:17:21.234
When I found you,

180
00:17:22.235 --> 00:17:25.395
I saw what all masters live to see.

181
00:17:26.156 --> 00:17:29.935
Raw, untamed power.

182
00:17:30.196 --> 00:17:31.935
And beyond that,

183
00:17:31.936 --> 00:17:35.434
something truly special.

184
00:17:36.396 --> 00:17:38.910
The potential of your bloodline.

185
00:17:39.916 --> 00:17:44.273
A new Vader.

186
00:17:49.996 --> 00:17:52.510
Now I fear...

187
00:17:54.196 --> 00:17:56.435
I was mistaken.

188
00:17:59.076 --> 00:18:01.390
<i>I've given everything I have to you.</i>

189
00:18:02.636 --> 00:18:03.955
<i>To the dark side.</i>

190
00:18:04.116 --> 00:18:07.028
Take that ridiculous thing off.

191
00:18:16.236 --> 00:18:19.990
Yes, there it is.

192
00:18:21.396 --> 00:18:24.832
You have too much
of your father's heart in you,

193
00:18:24.916 --> 00:18:25.951
young Solo.

194
00:18:26.156 --> 00:18:27.748
I killed Han Solo.

195
00:18:29.036 --> 00:18:30.833
When the moment came,
I didn't hesitate.

196
00:18:30.996 --> 00:18:32.554
And look at you,

197
00:18:32.636 --> 00:18:35.946
the deed split your spirit to the bone.

198
00:18:36.116 --> 00:18:38.584
You were unbalanced,

199
00:18:38.796 --> 00:18:42.471
bested by a girl
who had never held a lightsaber!

200
00:18:42.676 --> 00:18:43.904
You failed!

201
00:18:47.116 --> 00:18:48.515
Skywalker lives.

202
00:18:49.796 --> 00:18:54.426
The seed of the Jedi Order lives.

203
00:18:54.596 --> 00:18:56.473
And as long as it does,

204
00:18:56.636 --> 00:18:59.746
hope lives in the galaxy.

205
00:19:00.156 --> 00:19:02.236
I thought you...

206
00:19:02.237 --> 00:19:03.954
would be the one...

207
00:19:03.955 --> 00:19:05.389
to snuff it out.

208
00:19:06.596 --> 00:19:09.633
Alas, you're no Vader.

209
00:19:10.796 --> 00:19:12.910
You're just a child...

210
00:19:15.236 --> 00:19:17.031
in a mask.

211
00:19:50.236 --> 00:19:51.371
Prepare my ship.

212
00:19:57.336 --> 00:19:59.088
There's no light left in Kylo Ren.

213
00:19:59.956 --> 00:20:01.348
He's only getting stronger.

214
00:20:01.756 --> 00:20:04.965
The First Order will control
all the major systems within weeks.

215
00:20:05.676 --> 00:20:07.232
We need your help.

216
00:20:07.796 --> 00:20:09.790
We need the Jedi Order back.

217
00:20:12.796 --> 00:20:15.151
We need Luke Skywalker.

218
00:20:19.556 --> 00:20:21.709
You don't need Luke Skywalker.

219
00:20:22.556 --> 00:20:24.455
Did you hear a word I just said?

220
00:20:24.456 --> 00:20:25.455
You think what?

221
00:20:25.456 --> 00:20:30.152
I'm gonna walk out with a laser sword
and face down the whole First Order?

222
00:20:30.796 --> 00:20:33.294
What did you think
was going to happen here?

223
00:20:33.876 --> 00:20:34.995
You think that I came

224
00:20:34.996 --> 00:20:38.994
to the most unfindable place
in the galaxy for no reason at all?

225
00:20:39.476 --> 00:20:40.709
Go away.

226
00:20:41.476 --> 00:20:43.273
I'm not leaving without you!

227
00:21:51.236 --> 00:21:52.351
Careful!

228
00:22:28.476 --> 00:22:29.909
You're wasting your time.

229
00:23:47.596 --> 00:23:49.027
Who are you?

230
00:23:53.196 --> 00:23:55.391
I know this place.

231
00:24:01.116 --> 00:24:03.789
Built a thousand generations ago...

232
00:24:04.556 --> 00:24:06.065
to keep these.

233
00:24:07.596 --> 00:24:10.135
The original Jedi texts.

234
00:24:12.556 --> 00:24:14.118
Just like me,

235
00:24:14.419 --> 00:24:16.766
they're the last of the Jedi religion.

236
00:24:20.836 --> 00:24:22.189
You've seen this place.

237
00:24:22.656 --> 00:24:24.033
You've seen this island.

238
00:24:24.836 --> 00:24:26.327
Only in dreams.

239
00:24:27.956 --> 00:24:29.633
Who are you?

240
00:24:30.236 --> 00:24:31.236
The Resistance sent me.

241
00:24:31.396 --> 00:24:32.590
They sent you?

242
00:24:32.996 --> 00:24:34.987
What's special about you?

243
00:24:36.836 --> 00:24:38.195
Where are you from?

244
00:24:38.296 --> 00:24:39.092
Nowhere.

245
00:24:39.316 --> 00:24:41.650
No one's from nowhere.
Jakku.

246
00:24:41.956 --> 00:24:44.209
Alright, that is pretty much nowhere.

247
00:24:44.916 --> 00:24:47.310
Why are you here,
Rey from nowhere?

248
00:24:47.676 --> 00:24:48.911
The Resistance sent me.

249
00:24:49.956 --> 00:24:50.991
We need your help.

250
00:24:51.376 --> 00:24:52.315
The First Order's become unstoppable.

251
00:24:52.316 --> 00:24:54.355
Why are you here?

252
00:25:07.556 --> 00:25:10.946
Something inside me
has always been there.

253
00:25:13.436 --> 00:25:14.767
But now it's awake.

254
00:25:17.236 --> 00:25:18.515
And I'm afraid.

255
00:25:19.916 --> 00:25:20.985
I don't know what it is...

256
00:25:21.676 --> 00:25:23.207
or what to do with it.

257
00:25:23.676 --> 00:25:24.975
And I need help.

258
00:25:25.876 --> 00:25:27.446
You need a teacher.

259
00:25:29.036 --> 00:25:30.185
I can't teach you.

260
00:25:30.996 --> 00:25:32.031
Why not?

261
00:25:33.396 --> 00:25:35.352
I've seen your daily routine.
You're not busy.

262
00:25:35.816 --> 00:25:38.970
I will never train
another generation of Jedi.

263
00:25:39.716 --> 00:25:41.911
I came to this island to die.

264
00:25:43.556 --> 00:25:46.728
It's time for the Jedi, to end.

265
00:25:47.476 --> 00:25:48.476
Why?

266
00:25:49.876 --> 00:25:51.844
Leia sent me here with hope.

267
00:25:52.516 --> 00:25:54.949
If she was wrong,
she deserves to know why.

268
00:25:56.436 --> 00:25:57.610
We all do.

269
00:26:27.656 --> 00:26:29.192
You're demoted.
What? Wait! We...

270
00:26:29.693 --> 00:26:31.886
We took down a dreadnought.
At what cost?

271
00:26:32.056 --> 00:26:33.774
You start an attack,
you follow it through.

272
00:26:33.936 --> 00:26:35.928
Poe, get your head out of your cockpit.

273
00:26:36.196 --> 00:26:38.733
There are things that you cannot solve

274
00:26:38.734 --> 00:26:41.508
by jumping in an X-wing
and blowing something up!

275
00:26:41.876 --> 00:26:43.732
I need you to learn that.

276
00:26:44.916 --> 00:26:46.713
There were heroes on that mission.

277
00:26:47.176 --> 00:26:48.255
Dead heroes.

278
00:26:49.116 --> 00:26:50.515
No leaders.

279
00:26:55.916 --> 00:26:57.707
We're really nowhere.

280
00:26:58.076 --> 00:26:59.707
How's Rey gonna find us now?

281
00:27:02.436 --> 00:27:03.835
A cloaked binary beacon.

282
00:27:03.996 --> 00:27:05.509
To light her way home.

283
00:27:07.036 --> 00:27:09.072
Alright, so until she gets back,
what's the plan?

284
00:27:09.436 --> 00:27:11.033
We need to find a new base.

285
00:27:11.396 --> 00:27:13.724
One with enough power
to get a distress signal

286
00:27:13.725 --> 00:27:16.265
to our allies, scattered
in the Outer Rim.

287
00:27:17.996 --> 00:27:19.648
Proximity alert!

288
00:27:20.036 --> 00:27:21.036
They found us.

289
00:27:21.336 --> 00:27:22.535
That's impossible.

290
00:27:35.156 --> 00:27:36.987
That's Snoke's ship.

291
00:27:37.156 --> 00:27:38.455
You gotta be kidding me.

292
00:27:39.296 --> 00:27:40.343
Can we jump to lightspeed?

293
00:27:40.344 --> 00:27:42.055
We have enough fuel resources
for just one jump.

294
00:27:42.256 --> 00:27:43.492
Well, then, do it.
We gotta get out of here.

295
00:27:43.516 --> 00:27:44.535
Wait.

296
00:27:45.756 --> 00:27:48.116
They've tracked us through lightspeed.

297
00:27:49.596 --> 00:27:50.796
That's impossible.

298
00:27:51.116 --> 00:27:52.116
Yes.

299
00:27:53.916 --> 00:27:55.388
And they've done it.

300
00:27:56.756 --> 00:27:57.852
So if we jump through lightspeed,

301
00:27:57.876 --> 00:27:59.772
they'll just find us again
and we'll be out of fuel.

302
00:27:59.796 --> 00:28:00.796
They've got us.

303
00:28:01.256 --> 00:28:02.408
Not yet, they don't.

304
00:28:03.736 --> 00:28:05.556
Permission to jump in an X-wing
and blow something up?

305
00:28:05.736 --> 00:28:06.835
Permission granted.

306
00:28:06.996 --> 00:28:08.475
Admiral, swing us around!

307
00:28:08.636 --> 00:28:10.452
Full astern.
Rotate shields!

308
00:28:10.716 --> 00:28:13.153
To your stations!
Move, move, move!

309
00:28:27.636 --> 00:28:28.636
Follow my lead.

310
00:28:33.556 --> 00:28:35.770
<i>Green Squadron to launch position.</i>

311
00:28:36.236 --> 00:28:38.352
<i>Clear all launch traffic.</i>

312
00:28:42.056 --> 00:28:44.126
Don't wait for me!
Jump in and fire her up!

313
00:28:44.236 --> 00:28:48.149
Technicians, lock down supplies
for launch conditions.

314
00:29:18.996 --> 00:29:20.327
Move! Move!

315
00:29:37.596 --> 00:29:38.995
Poe, are you alright?

316
00:29:39.156 --> 00:29:41.351
We need to get out of range
of those Star Destroyers.

317
00:29:41.516 --> 00:29:42.715
We need to what?

318
00:29:43.076 --> 00:29:44.429
Full engines ahead.

319
00:29:44.596 --> 00:29:48.271
Get out of range of the Star Destroyers
and the fighters will fall back.

320
00:29:48.436 --> 00:29:50.008
All craft, full engines!

321
00:29:50.276 --> 00:29:51.812
Concentrate rear shields.

322
00:30:50.796 --> 00:30:52.832
<i>Ren, the Resistance
have pulled out of range.</i>

323
00:30:53.036 --> 00:30:54.549
<i>We can't cover you at this distance.</i>

324
00:30:54.716 --> 00:30:56.171
<i>Return to the fleet.</i>

325
00:30:58.916 --> 00:31:01.305
What is the point of all this

326
00:31:01.476 --> 00:31:04.366
if we can't blow up three tiny cruisers?

327
00:31:05.036 --> 00:31:06.727
Well, they're faster and lighter, sir.

328
00:31:07.196 --> 00:31:09.076
They can't lose us,
but they can keep at a range

329
00:31:09.156 --> 00:31:11.356
where our cannons are ineffective
against their shields.

330
00:31:11.916 --> 00:31:14.035
Well, keep up the barrage.

331
00:31:14.796 --> 00:31:16.864
Let's at least remind them
that we're still here.

332
00:31:17.376 --> 00:31:18.376
Very good, sir.

333
00:31:18.716 --> 00:31:21.206
They won't last long
burning fuel like this.

334
00:31:22.276 --> 00:31:24.071
It's just a matter of time.

335
00:32:31.836 --> 00:32:33.872
Move! Out of the way, everybody!
Give room!

336
00:32:33.996 --> 00:32:35.505
Life signs are weak, but she's fighting.

337
00:34:08.736 --> 00:34:09.736
Artoo?

338
00:34:11.076 --> 00:34:12.248
Artoo!

339
00:34:14.956 --> 00:34:15.789
Yes.

340
00:34:16.016 --> 00:34:17.172
Yeah, I know.

341
00:34:18.356 --> 00:34:20.426
Hey, sacred island, watch the language.

342
00:34:22.916 --> 00:34:24.252
Old friend.

343
00:34:26.676 --> 00:34:28.632
I wish I could make you understand.

344
00:34:29.676 --> 00:34:31.467
But I'm not coming back.

345
00:34:32.396 --> 00:34:35.452
Nothing can make me
change my mind.

346
00:34:40.036 --> 00:34:42.550
<i>Years ago, you served my father
in the Clone Wars.</i>

347
00:34:42.916 --> 00:34:45.476
<i>Now he begs you to help him
in his struggle against the Empire.</i>

348
00:34:45.636 --> 00:34:47.892
<i>I regret that I am unable to present
my father's request to you in person...</i>

349
00:34:47.916 --> 00:34:49.190
That was a cheap move.

350
00:34:49.596 --> 00:34:51.132
<i>But my ship has fallen under attack,</i>

351
00:34:51.156 --> 00:34:53.624
<i>and I'm afraid my mission
to bring you to Alderaan has failed.</i>

352
00:34:53.756 --> 00:34:55.612
<i>This is our most desperate hour.</i>

353
00:34:55.876 --> 00:34:57.389
<i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.</i>

354
00:34:58.516 --> 00:34:59.710
<i>You're my only hope.</i>

355
00:35:11.116 --> 00:35:13.489
Tomorrow at dawn.

356
00:35:14.516 --> 00:35:15.735
Three lessons.

357
00:35:15.996 --> 00:35:18.490
I will teach you the ways of the Jedi,

358
00:35:19.276 --> 00:35:20.828
and why they need to end.

359
00:35:31.196 --> 00:35:32.515
General Organa,

360
00:35:33.516 --> 00:35:34.516
Leia,

361
00:35:34.836 --> 00:35:37.509
is unconscious but recovering.

362
00:35:38.916 --> 00:35:40.852
That's the only good news I have.

363
00:35:41.596 --> 00:35:42.945
Admiral Ackbar,

364
00:35:43.446 --> 00:35:44.949
all our leadership,

365
00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:46.074
they're gone.

366
00:35:47.116 --> 00:35:48.996
Leia was the sole survivor
on the bridge.

367
00:35:49.196 --> 00:35:50.390
Oh, dear. Oh, dear!

368
00:35:50.556 --> 00:35:54.374
If she were here, she'd say
save your sorrow for after the fight.

369
00:35:55.876 --> 00:35:56.945
To that end,

370
00:35:57.996 --> 00:36:01.350
the chain of command is clear
as to who should take her place.

371
00:36:02.876 --> 00:36:04.414
Vice Admiral Holdo

372
00:36:04.956 --> 00:36:06.508
of the cruiser Ninka.

373
00:36:07.796 --> 00:36:09.129
Thank you, Commander.

374
00:36:15.556 --> 00:36:16.750
Four hundred of us,

375
00:36:16.916 --> 00:36:18.229
on three ships.

376
00:36:19.956 --> 00:36:22.350
We're the very last
of the Resistance.

377
00:36:24.556 --> 00:36:25.886
But we're not alone.

378
00:36:26.956 --> 00:36:29.151
In every corner of the galaxy,

379
00:36:29.316 --> 00:36:32.114
the downtrodden and oppressed
know our symbol,

380
00:36:32.396 --> 00:36:34.148
and they put their hope in it.

381
00:36:34.916 --> 00:36:36.508
We are the spark

382
00:36:36.596 --> 00:36:39.845
that will light the fire that
will restore the Republic.

383
00:36:41.196 --> 00:36:42.440
That spark,

384
00:36:42.741 --> 00:36:45.367
this Resistance must survive.

385
00:36:46.676 --> 00:36:48.426
That is our mission.

386
00:36:50.316 --> 00:36:51.590
Now, to your stations.

387
00:36:54.196 --> 00:36:55.891
And may the Force be with us.

388
00:37:01.956 --> 00:37:03.230
That's Admiral Holdo?

389
00:37:04.236 --> 00:37:06.172
Battle of Chyron Belt Admiral Holdo?

390
00:37:09.636 --> 00:37:10.810
Not what I expected.

391
00:37:12.236 --> 00:37:13.249
Vice Admiral?

392
00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:14.691
Commander Dameron.

393
00:37:14.856 --> 00:37:17.696
With our current fuel consumption,
there is a very limited amount of time

394
00:37:17.756 --> 00:37:19.612
that we can stay out of range
of those Star Destroyers.

395
00:37:19.836 --> 00:37:21.591
Very kind of you to make me aware.

396
00:37:22.396 --> 00:37:23.532
Let's get me those fuel projections.

397
00:37:23.556 --> 00:37:25.676
And we need to shake them
before we can find a new base, so...

398
00:37:25.956 --> 00:37:27.009
what's our plan?

399
00:37:27.476 --> 00:37:29.173
Our plan, captain?

400
00:37:30.156 --> 00:37:31.828
Not commander, right?

401
00:37:31.896 --> 00:37:34.046
Wasn't it Leia's last official act
to demote you,

402
00:37:34.316 --> 00:37:35.369
for your dreadnought plan...

403
00:37:36.396 --> 00:37:38.671
where we lost our entire bombing fleet?

404
00:37:42.116 --> 00:37:43.435
Captain. Commander.

405
00:37:43.516 --> 00:37:44.876
You can call me whatever you like.

406
00:37:44.996 --> 00:37:46.534
I just wanna know what's going on.

407
00:37:47.316 --> 00:37:48.365
Of course you do.

408
00:37:48.956 --> 00:37:49.956
I understand.

409
00:37:50.556 --> 00:37:53.268
I've dealt with plenty
of trigger-happy flyboys like you.

410
00:37:53.996 --> 00:37:55.096
You're impulsive.

411
00:37:56.876 --> 00:37:57.991
Dangerous.

412
00:37:59.356 --> 00:38:00.948
And the last thing we need right now.

413
00:38:01.996 --> 00:38:05.709
So stick to your post
and follow my orders.

414
00:38:18.996 --> 00:38:20.892
<i>Turbolink banks seven and eight</i>

415
00:38:20.916 --> 00:38:22.493
<i>are offline due to maintenance.</i>

416
00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:57.774
What are you doing here?

417
00:38:57.996 --> 00:38:59.395
Hey. Hi.

418
00:39:00.676 --> 00:39:01.474
I was...

419
00:39:01.775 --> 00:39:03.384
You know, I was just...
You're Finn!

420
00:39:04.756 --> 00:39:05.850
The Finn!

421
00:39:06.436 --> 00:39:07.888
The Finn?
Sorry.

422
00:39:08.556 --> 00:39:10.114
I work behind pipes all day.

423
00:39:10.556 --> 00:39:14.071
Doing talking with Resistance heroes
is not my forte.

424
00:39:15.236 --> 00:39:16.330
Doing...

425
00:39:16.596 --> 00:39:17.811
Doing talking.

426
00:39:18.916 --> 00:39:19.995
I'm Rose.

427
00:39:20.756 --> 00:39:21.771
Breathe.

428
00:39:23.056 --> 00:39:23.649
Ok.

429
00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:27.706
Yeah. Look, I'm not a Resistance hero,
but it was nice talking to you, Rose.

430
00:39:31.116 --> 00:39:32.608
May the Force be with you.

431
00:39:34.616 --> 00:39:35.791
You, too.

432
00:39:37.476 --> 00:39:40.288
Ok. But you are a hero.

433
00:39:41.076 --> 00:39:43.734
You left the First Order,
what you did on the Starkiller Base...

434
00:39:44.196 --> 00:39:46.222
When we heard about it,
my sister Paige said Rose...

435
00:39:46.523 --> 00:39:47.694
that's a real hero.

436
00:39:48.036 --> 00:39:50.856
Know right from wrong and don't
run away when it gets hard she said.

437
00:39:51.236 --> 00:39:52.332
You know...

438
00:39:52.356 --> 00:39:54.074
Just this morning, I've had to stun

439
00:39:54.156 --> 00:39:56.431
three people trying to jump
ship in this escape pod.

440
00:39:56.596 --> 00:39:58.666
What?
They were running away.

441
00:39:59.036 --> 00:40:00.185
That's disgraceful.

442
00:40:01.156 --> 00:40:02.171
I know.

443
00:40:05.276 --> 00:40:06.276
Anyway...

444
00:40:06.436 --> 00:40:08.108
Gotta get back
to what I was doing, so...

445
00:40:08.376 --> 00:40:09.495
What were you doing?

446
00:40:10.196 --> 00:40:11.290
Just...

447
00:40:11.476 --> 00:40:13.356
Checking the escape pods.
Doing some checks.

448
00:40:13.676 --> 00:40:15.731
No, it's routine checks.
By boarding one...

449
00:40:17.596 --> 00:40:18.795
with a packed bag.

450
00:40:19.716 --> 00:40:20.716
Ok.

451
00:40:20.876 --> 00:40:21.932
Listen, I'm...

452
00:40:35.676 --> 00:40:37.587
I can't move.
I can't move.

453
00:40:37.756 --> 00:40:39.633
I know.
What happened?

454
00:40:39.796 --> 00:40:41.732
I'm taking you to the brig
and turning you in for desertion.

455
00:40:41.756 --> 00:40:42.905
I was not deserting.

456
00:40:43.076 --> 00:40:45.306
I told you that...
My sister just died

457
00:40:45.476 --> 00:40:46.768
protecting the fleet.

458
00:40:47.236 --> 00:40:49.247
And you were running away.

459
00:40:50.196 --> 00:40:51.211
I'm sorry.

460
00:40:51.716 --> 00:40:52.716
But this fleet is doomed,

461
00:40:52.796 --> 00:40:55.026
and if my friend comes back to it,
she's doomed too.

462
00:40:55.356 --> 00:40:56.371
I've gotta get this...

463
00:40:57.956 --> 00:40:59.833
I gotta get this beacon
far away from here.

464
00:40:59.996 --> 00:41:01.349
Then she'll find me and be safe.

465
00:41:02.196 --> 00:41:03.773
You're a selfish traitor.

466
00:41:04.516 --> 00:41:06.236
Look, we can't outrun
the First Order fleet.

467
00:41:06.436 --> 00:41:07.710
We can jump to lightspeed!

468
00:41:07.876 --> 00:41:09.292
Well, they can track us
through lightspeed.

469
00:41:09.516 --> 00:41:10.572
They can track us through lightspeed?

470
00:41:10.596 --> 00:41:11.596
Yeah.

471
00:41:11.676 --> 00:41:12.732
They'd just show up
thirty seconds later

472
00:41:12.756 --> 00:41:13.812
and we'd have blown a ton of fuel,

473
00:41:13.836 --> 00:41:15.952
which by the way,
we're dangerously short on.

474
00:41:16.636 --> 00:41:18.354
They can track us through lightspeed.
Yes.

475
00:41:18.676 --> 00:41:19.676
And they could...

476
00:41:20.196 --> 00:41:21.196
I can't feel my teeth.

477
00:41:21.756 --> 00:41:23.155
What did you shoot me with?

478
00:41:23.316 --> 00:41:24.316
Active tracking.

479
00:41:24.476 --> 00:41:25.511
What now?

480
00:41:26.156 --> 00:41:27.372
Hyperspace tracking is new tech

481
00:41:27.396 --> 00:41:29.910
but the principle must be
the same as any active tracker.

482
00:41:30.076 --> 00:41:32.510
They're only tracking us
from the lead ship.

483
00:41:33.276 --> 00:41:34.675
But we can't get to the tracker.

484
00:41:35.056 --> 00:41:36.932
It's an A-class process,
they'll control it from the main bridge.

485
00:41:36.986 --> 00:41:38.342
Well I mean, yes,
but every A-class process...

486
00:41:38.436 --> 00:41:40.625
has a dedicated power breaker.

487
00:41:41.356 --> 00:41:41.977
But.

488
00:41:42.378 --> 00:41:44.916
Wait, but who knows where
the breaker room is on a Star Destroyer?

489
00:41:47.196 --> 00:41:49.073
I'm the guy that used to mop it.

490
00:41:49.556 --> 00:41:50.784
If I can get us there,

491
00:41:51.276 --> 00:41:53.007
I can shut their tracker down.

492
00:41:53.636 --> 00:41:55.492
Just give it to me
one more time, simpler.

493
00:41:55.756 --> 00:41:58.743
So, the First Order's only
tracking us from one Destroyer,

494
00:41:58.744 --> 00:42:00.205
the lead one.
So we blow that one up?

495
00:42:00.476 --> 00:42:01.812
I like where your head's at, but no.

496
00:42:01.836 --> 00:42:03.652
They'd only start tracking us
from another Destroyer.

497
00:42:03.676 --> 00:42:04.676
But if we can...

498
00:42:04.756 --> 00:42:07.012
If we sneak on board the lead Destroyer
and disable the tracker

499
00:42:07.036 --> 00:42:08.372
without them realizing, then we can...

500
00:42:08.396 --> 00:42:10.466
They won't realize it's off
for one system cycle.

501
00:42:10.636 --> 00:42:13.025
About six minutes.
Sneak on board.

502
00:42:15.356 --> 00:42:16.669
Disable the tracker.

503
00:42:18.276 --> 00:42:20.171
Our fleet escapes before they realize.

504
00:42:28.876 --> 00:42:29.876
How'd you two meet?

505
00:42:32.836 --> 00:42:33.836
Just luck.

506
00:42:35.596 --> 00:42:36.596
Yeah?

507
00:42:36.956 --> 00:42:37.984
Good luck?

508
00:42:38.636 --> 00:42:39.785
Not sure yet.

509
00:42:40.276 --> 00:42:41.629
Poe, we gotta do this.

510
00:42:41.796 --> 00:42:43.991
It'll save the fleet and it'll save Rey.

511
00:42:45.756 --> 00:42:48.116
If I must be the sole voice of reason,

512
00:42:48.117 --> 00:42:50.567
Admiral Holdo will never
agree to this plan.

513
00:42:51.836 --> 00:42:53.970
Yeah, you're right, Threepio.

514
00:42:54.436 --> 00:42:56.996
It's a need-to-know plan,
and she doesn't.

515
00:42:57.256 --> 00:42:58.894
That wasn't exactly my...
Alright,

516
00:42:59.056 --> 00:43:00.409
you guys shut down that tracker.

517
00:43:00.476 --> 00:43:01.996
I'll be here to jump us to lightspeed.

518
00:43:02.116 --> 00:43:03.116
The question is,

519
00:43:03.376 --> 00:43:05.496
how do we sneak the two of you
onto Snoke's Destroyer?

520
00:43:05.516 --> 00:43:06.552
We steal clearance codes.

521
00:43:06.553 --> 00:43:08.756
No, they're bio-hexacrypt
and rescrambled every hour.

522
00:43:10.516 --> 00:43:12.976
We can't get through their
security shields undetected.

523
00:43:13.756 --> 00:43:14.784
Nobody can.

524
00:43:18.836 --> 00:43:20.049
<i>Could I do it?</i>

525
00:43:20.516 --> 00:43:21.890
<i>Of course I could do it.</i>

526
00:43:21.891 --> 00:43:22.746
<i>But I can't do it.</i>

527
00:43:23.116 --> 00:43:24.788
<i>I'm a little tied down right now.</i>

528
00:43:26.236 --> 00:43:28.047
Maz? What is happening?

529
00:43:28.236 --> 00:43:31.192
<i>Union dispute.
You do not want to hear about it.</i>

530
00:43:31.676 --> 00:43:33.428
<i>But, lucky for you,</i>

531
00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:37.304
<i>there is exactly one guy I trust
who can crack that kind of security!</i>

532
00:43:39.836 --> 00:43:41.474
<i>He's a master codebreaker,</i>

533
00:43:41.676 --> 00:43:43.090
<i>an ace pilot,</i>

534
00:43:43.091 --> 00:43:44.568
<i>a poet with a blaster.</i>

535
00:43:47.276 --> 00:43:48.276
Oh, my.

536
00:43:48.476 --> 00:43:50.716
It sounds like this codebreaker fellow
can do everything.

537
00:43:51.076 --> 00:43:53.144
<i>Oh, yes, he can.</i>

538
00:43:54.756 --> 00:43:58.656
<i>You'll find him with a red
plom bloom on his lapel</i>

539
00:43:58.876 --> 00:44:01.470
<i>rolling at a high stakes table</i>

540
00:44:01.836 --> 00:44:03.827
<i>in the casino on Canto Bight.</i>

541
00:44:03.996 --> 00:44:05.648
Canto Bight? No, no. That's...

542
00:44:05.949 --> 00:44:06.950
Maz...

543
00:44:07.156 --> 00:44:09.132
Is there any way that we can
take care of this ourselves?

544
00:44:09.156 --> 00:44:10.376
<i>Sorry, kiddo.</i>

545
00:44:10.377 --> 00:44:11.929
<i>This is rarefied cracking.</i>

546
00:44:12.356 --> 00:44:13.709
<i>You wanna get on that Destroyer,</i>

547
00:44:13.836 --> 00:44:15.349
<i>I only know one option.</i>

548
00:44:15.876 --> 00:44:17.890
<i>Find the Master Codebreaker.</i>

549
00:45:46.716 --> 00:45:48.605
You'll bring Luke Skywalker to me.

550
00:45:55.316 --> 00:45:57.591
You're not doing this.
The effort would kill you.

551
00:46:02.596 --> 00:46:03.716
Can you see my surroundings?

552
00:46:03.836 --> 00:46:05.349
You're gonna pay for what you did!

553
00:46:05.516 --> 00:46:06.790
I can't see yours.

554
00:46:08.476 --> 00:46:09.570
Just you.

555
00:46:11.916 --> 00:46:13.315
So, no.

556
00:46:14.956 --> 00:46:16.711
This is something else.

557
00:46:23.276 --> 00:46:24.276
Luke.

558
00:46:24.636 --> 00:46:26.088
What's that about?

559
00:46:40.996 --> 00:46:43.085
I was cleaning my blaster.
It went off.

560
00:46:46.436 --> 00:46:47.585
Let's get started.

561
00:46:51.756 --> 00:46:53.235
Who were those things?

562
00:46:54.036 --> 00:46:55.355
Caretakers.

563
00:46:55.516 --> 00:46:56.631
Island natives.

564
00:46:56.796 --> 00:46:59.185
They've kept up the Jedi structures
since they were built.

565
00:46:59.916 --> 00:47:01.474
I don't think they like me.

566
00:47:01.636 --> 00:47:03.308
Can't imagine why.

567
00:47:39.276 --> 00:47:40.595
Master Skywalker,

568
00:47:41.116 --> 00:47:42.412
we need you to bring the Jedi back

569
00:47:42.436 --> 00:47:45.234
because Kylo Ren is strong
with the dark side of the Force.

570
00:47:45.396 --> 00:47:47.764
Without the Jedi, we won't
stand a chance against him.

571
00:47:48.036 --> 00:47:49.845
What do you know about the Force?

572
00:47:50.876 --> 00:47:53.709
It's a power that Jedi have
that lets them control people

573
00:47:54.436 --> 00:47:55.869
and make things float.

574
00:47:55.956 --> 00:47:56.956
Impressive.

575
00:47:57.416 --> 00:47:59.172
Every word in that sentence was wrong.

576
00:47:59.596 --> 00:48:02.627
Lesson one, sit here, legs crossed.

577
00:48:09.676 --> 00:48:12.748
The Force is not a power you have.

578
00:48:12.916 --> 00:48:14.725
It's not about lifting rocks.

579
00:48:15.596 --> 00:48:17.527
It's the energy between all things,

580
00:48:17.596 --> 00:48:19.666
a tension, a balance,

581
00:48:19.836 --> 00:48:21.911
that binds the universe together.

582
00:48:22.276 --> 00:48:23.176
Ok.

583
00:48:24.436 --> 00:48:25.585
But what is it?

584
00:48:27.076 --> 00:48:28.270
Close your eyes.

585
00:48:30.196 --> 00:48:31.549
Breathe.

586
00:48:32.276 --> 00:48:33.276
Now,

587
00:48:34.716 --> 00:48:35.865
reach out.

588
00:48:42.636 --> 00:48:43.671
I feel something.

589
00:48:43.796 --> 00:48:44.852
You feel it?
Yes, I feel it.

590
00:48:44.876 --> 00:48:45.996
That's the Force.
Really?

591
00:48:46.036 --> 00:48:47.652
It must be
really strong with you.

592
00:48:47.676 --> 00:48:48.676
I've never felt any...

593
00:48:52.676 --> 00:48:53.904
You meant reach out like...

594
00:48:56.556 --> 00:48:57.556
I'll try again.

595
00:49:00.076 --> 00:49:01.076
Breathe.

596
00:49:03.316 --> 00:49:05.193
Just breathe.

597
00:49:08.356 --> 00:49:10.586
Reach out with your feelings.

598
00:49:15.956 --> 00:49:17.150
What do you see?

599
00:49:21.236 --> 00:49:22.236
The island.

600
00:49:24.156 --> 00:49:25.191
Life.

601
00:49:26.556 --> 00:49:27.875
Death and decay,

602
00:49:29.436 --> 00:49:30.869
that feeds new life.

603
00:49:32.556 --> 00:49:33.591
Warmth.

604
00:49:34.716 --> 00:49:35.716
Cold.

605
00:49:37.996 --> 00:49:39.195
Peace.

606
00:49:40.996 --> 00:49:42.070
Violence.

607
00:49:43.316 --> 00:49:44.795
And between it all?

608
00:49:45.596 --> 00:49:46.596
Balance.

609
00:49:47.356 --> 00:49:48.584
An energy.

610
00:49:51.796 --> 00:49:53.129
A Force.

611
00:49:54.876 --> 00:49:56.468
And inside you?

612
00:49:57.636 --> 00:49:59.028
Inside me...

613
00:50:00.396 --> 00:50:02.266
that same Force.

614
00:50:03.956 --> 00:50:06.754
And this is the lesson.

615
00:50:06.916 --> 00:50:10.033
That Force does not
belong to the Jedi.

616
00:50:11.316 --> 00:50:14.069
To say that if the Jedi die,
the light dies, is vanity.

617
00:50:14.276 --> 00:50:15.992
Can you feel that?

618
00:50:18.156 --> 00:50:19.694
There's something else...

619
00:50:21.836 --> 00:50:23.269
beneath the island.

620
00:50:24.196 --> 00:50:25.196
A place.

621
00:50:26.556 --> 00:50:27.705
A dark place.

622
00:50:29.836 --> 00:50:30.851
Balance.

623
00:50:31.716 --> 00:50:33.647
Powerful light, powerful darkness.

624
00:50:33.916 --> 00:50:35.031
It's cold.

625
00:50:40.796 --> 00:50:41.865
It's calling me.

626
00:50:43.196 --> 00:50:44.231
Resist it, Rey.

627
00:50:45.356 --> 00:50:46.360
Rey?

628
00:50:49.156 --> 00:50:50.156
Rey!

629
00:50:58.996 --> 00:51:00.793
You went straight to the dark.

630
00:51:02.156 --> 00:51:03.836
That place was trying
to show me something.

631
00:51:03.976 --> 00:51:05.507
It offered something you needed.

632
00:51:06.316 --> 00:51:08.325
And you didn't even try
to stop yourself.

633
00:51:09.796 --> 00:51:11.188
But I didn't see you.

634
00:51:13.356 --> 00:51:14.728
Nothing from you.

635
00:51:18.476 --> 00:51:20.685
You've closed yourself off
from the Force.

636
00:51:24.356 --> 00:51:25.609
Of course you have.

637
00:51:27.076 --> 00:51:29.848
I've seen this raw strength
only once before,

638
00:51:30.676 --> 00:51:32.228
in Ben Solo.

639
00:51:32.596 --> 00:51:34.214
It didn't scare me enough then.

640
00:51:35.516 --> 00:51:36.929
It does now.

641
00:51:49.436 --> 00:51:50.436
What was that?

642
00:51:50.596 --> 00:51:51.690
Nothing, admiral.

643
00:51:51.996 --> 00:51:53.249
Passing debris.

644
00:52:00.676 --> 00:52:02.507
The fleet's only got
18 hours of fuel left.

645
00:52:02.916 --> 00:52:04.035
We gotta hurry.

646
00:52:05.556 --> 00:52:07.312
Still can't reach the Resistance?

647
00:52:08.396 --> 00:52:09.468
Keep at it.

648
00:52:09.476 --> 00:52:11.114
If you get through, check their status.

649
00:52:11.276 --> 00:52:12.395
And ask about Finn.

650
00:52:47.796 --> 00:52:49.652
Why is the Force connecting us?

651
00:52:50.116 --> 00:52:51.116
You and I.

652
00:52:51.276 --> 00:52:52.675
Murderous snake.

653
00:52:53.436 --> 00:52:54.434
You're too late.

654
00:52:54.435 --> 00:52:56.473
You lost. I found Skywalker.

655
00:52:57.756 --> 00:52:58.956
Did he tell you what happened?

656
00:53:00.356 --> 00:53:02.506
The night I destroyed his temple,
did he tell you why?

657
00:53:02.676 --> 00:53:04.870
I know everything
I need to know about you.

658
00:53:05.436 --> 00:53:06.449
You do?

659
00:53:09.516 --> 00:53:11.427
You do.

660
00:53:12.716 --> 00:53:14.427
You have that look in your eyes.

661
00:53:14.796 --> 00:53:16.593
From the forest.

662
00:53:19.276 --> 00:53:20.675
When you called me a monster.

663
00:53:20.676 --> 00:53:22.592
You are a monster.

664
00:53:28.036 --> 00:53:29.189
Yes, I am.

665
00:53:53.716 --> 00:53:54.716
Ok.

666
00:53:54.916 --> 00:53:57.146
We get in, we find this codebreaker,
we get out.

667
00:53:57.316 --> 00:53:59.411
You know this town?
Canto Bight?

668
00:53:59.676 --> 00:54:00.870
From stories.

669
00:54:01.036 --> 00:54:04.472
It's a terrible place filled with
the worst people in the galaxy.

670
00:54:04.596 --> 00:54:05.596
Great.

671
00:54:26.836 --> 00:54:28.474
I told those two, I said,

672
00:54:28.636 --> 00:54:31.309
This is a public beach.
You can't park that shuttle here.

673
00:54:31.476 --> 00:54:34.070
But they just lit off toward the casino.

674
00:54:41.196 --> 00:54:42.629
Place your bets.
Place your bets.

675
00:54:42.836 --> 00:54:44.588
All bets on the table
right now, right now!

676
00:54:44.716 --> 00:54:45.751
Place your bets here.

677
00:54:59.396 --> 00:55:00.097
Ah, yes!

678
00:55:00.698 --> 00:55:03.013
This place, is great!

679
00:55:03.156 --> 00:55:04.156
Ok.

680
00:55:06.796 --> 00:55:10.345
Maz said this Master Codebreaker
would have a red plom bloom on his lapel.

681
00:55:10.516 --> 00:55:12.416
Let's find him and get out of here.

682
00:55:12.936 --> 00:55:14.472
Well played.
The house wins.

683
00:55:15.756 --> 00:55:16.812
Where are your manners, more like?

684
00:55:16.836 --> 00:55:17.836
Come on!

685
00:55:41.676 --> 00:55:42.732
We've covered this whole casino.

686
00:55:42.756 --> 00:55:43.756
Zero red plom blooms.

687
00:55:43.836 --> 00:55:45.476
Where is this guy?

688
00:55:50.236 --> 00:55:51.708
Were those what I think they were?

689
00:55:59.116 --> 00:56:00.267
What are those things?

690
00:56:00.268 --> 00:56:01.107
Fathiers.

691
00:56:02.036 --> 00:56:03.449
I've never seen a real one.

692
00:56:04.236 --> 00:56:06.675
Look, this whole place is beautiful.
I mean, come on.

693
00:56:07.636 --> 00:56:09.274
Why do you hate it so much?

694
00:56:10.236 --> 00:56:11.410
Look closer.

695
00:56:16.716 --> 00:56:19.149
My sister and I grew up
in a poor mining system.

696
00:56:21.196 --> 00:56:24.472
The First Order stripped our ore
to finance their military

697
00:56:25.876 --> 00:56:28.092
then shelled us to test their weapons.

698
00:56:34.036 --> 00:56:35.706
They took everything we had.

699
00:56:37.436 --> 00:56:39.796
And who do you think
these people are?

700
00:56:40.476 --> 00:56:44.012
There's only one business in the galaxy
that'll get you this rich.

701
00:56:44.596 --> 00:56:45.611
War.

702
00:56:46.196 --> 00:56:48.551
Selling weapons to the First Order.

703
00:56:50.556 --> 00:56:54.911
I wish I could put my fist through this
whole lousy, beautiful town.

704
00:57:02.756 --> 00:57:03.791
Red plom bloom!

705
00:57:12.036 --> 00:57:13.071
Red plom bloom!

706
00:57:13.276 --> 00:57:14.425
The Master Codebreaker!

707
00:57:20.796 --> 00:57:22.454
Yep, those are the shuttle parkers.

708
00:57:23.556 --> 00:57:24.556
Alright.

709
00:57:24.676 --> 00:57:29.113
You two are under arrest
for parking violation 27B/6.

710
00:57:29.276 --> 00:57:30.332
You have the right to remain...

711
00:57:30.356 --> 00:57:32.372
What was that?
No, no, no. Not now, Lovey.

712
00:57:32.556 --> 00:57:33.591
I'm on a roll.

713
00:59:17.636 --> 00:59:18.889
Lesson two.

714
00:59:19.196 --> 00:59:23.348
Now that they're extinct,
the Jedi are romanticized, deified.

715
00:59:23.836 --> 00:59:26.389
But if you strip away the myth
and look at their deeds,

716
00:59:27.076 --> 00:59:29.112
the legacy of the Jedi is failure.

717
00:59:29.436 --> 00:59:30.585
Hypocrisy, hubris.

718
00:59:30.716 --> 00:59:31.716
That's not true.

719
00:59:31.916 --> 00:59:34.476
At the height of their powers,
they allowed Darth Sidious to rise

720
00:59:34.596 --> 00:59:36.473
create the Empire, and wipe them out.

721
00:59:36.876 --> 00:59:38.787
It was a Jedi Master
who was responsible

722
00:59:38.956 --> 00:59:42.073
for the training
and creation of Darth Vader.

723
00:59:42.236 --> 00:59:43.749
And a Jedi who saved him.

724
00:59:44.436 --> 00:59:46.536
Yes, the most hated man in the galaxy.

725
00:59:46.656 --> 00:59:48.451
But you saw there
was conflict inside him.

726
00:59:48.556 --> 00:59:51.050
You believed that he wasn't gone.
That he could be turned.

727
00:59:51.516 --> 00:59:53.088
And I became a legend.

728
00:59:54.556 --> 00:59:56.706
For many years, there was balance,

729
00:59:56.876 --> 00:59:58.275
and then I saw...

730
00:59:58.556 --> 00:59:59.556
Ben.

731
01:00:00.996 --> 01:00:02.229
My nephew,

732
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:04.871
with that mighty Skywalker blood.

733
01:00:05.036 --> 01:00:07.556
And in my hubris, I thought
I could train him, I could,

734
01:00:07.557 --> 01:00:09.107
pass on my strengths.

735
01:00:10.716 --> 01:00:11.912
Han was...

736
01:00:12.613 --> 01:00:14.126
Han about it but...

737
01:00:16.596 --> 01:00:17.609
Leia...

738
01:00:19.556 --> 01:00:21.811
trusted me with her son.

739
01:00:22.716 --> 01:00:23.716
I took him,

740
01:00:24.756 --> 01:00:26.308
and a dozen students,

741
01:00:27.556 --> 01:00:29.069
and began a training temple.

742
01:00:31.236 --> 01:00:33.010
By the time I realized I was...

743
01:00:33.611 --> 01:00:36.053
no match for the darkness
rising in him,

744
01:00:37.156 --> 01:00:38.714
it was too late.

745
01:00:40.036 --> 01:00:41.389
What happened?

746
01:00:44.836 --> 01:00:46.315
I went to confront him.

747
01:00:48.596 --> 01:00:50.168
And he turned on me.

748
01:00:50.676 --> 01:00:52.155
Ben, no!

749
01:00:55.276 --> 01:00:57.092
He must have thought I was dead.

750
01:00:59.076 --> 01:01:00.304
When I came to,

751
01:01:02.396 --> 01:01:03.968
the temple was burning.

752
01:01:05.516 --> 01:01:08.189
He had vanished
with a handful of my students.

753
01:01:09.276 --> 01:01:11.471
And slaughtered the rest.

754
01:01:12.916 --> 01:01:14.907
Leia blamed Snoke but...

755
01:01:15.596 --> 01:01:16.824
it was me.

756
01:01:17.556 --> 01:01:18.855
I failed.

757
01:01:22.476 --> 01:01:25.213
Because I was Luke Skywalker.

758
01:01:26.436 --> 01:01:27.947
Jedi Master.

759
01:01:33.676 --> 01:01:35.048
A legend.

760
01:01:37.556 --> 01:01:39.431
The galaxy may need a legend.

761
01:01:44.436 --> 01:01:48.414
I need someone to show me
my place in all this.

762
01:01:54.556 --> 01:01:56.274
And you didn't fail Kylo.

763
01:01:56.676 --> 01:01:57.814
Kylo failed you.

764
01:01:58.836 --> 01:02:00.008
I won't.

765
01:02:21.196 --> 01:02:23.529
The main cruiser's
still keeping beyond range.

766
01:02:24.716 --> 01:02:26.547
But their medical frigate is out of fuel...

767
01:02:27.476 --> 01:02:29.228
and its shields are down.

768
01:02:29.396 --> 01:02:31.173
The beginning of their end.

769
01:02:32.756 --> 01:02:34.108
Destroy it.

770
01:02:37.556 --> 01:02:40.866
The last of our crew has been
evacuated and heading your way.

771
01:02:41.916 --> 01:02:43.454
It's been an honor, admiral.

772
01:02:43.716 --> 01:02:45.593
<i>Godspeed, Rebels!</i>

773
01:02:48.956 --> 01:02:49.991
Admiral,

774
01:02:50.716 --> 01:02:52.672
fuel reserves at six hours.

775
01:02:54.476 --> 01:02:56.512
Maintain our current course.

776
01:02:57.356 --> 01:02:58.828
Steady on.

777
01:03:04.116 --> 01:03:05.116
Finn,

778
01:03:05.276 --> 01:03:07.292
Rose, where are you guys?

779
01:03:12.756 --> 01:03:13.805
Deal me in.

780
01:03:17.036 --> 01:03:18.036
Thanks.

781
01:03:19.996 --> 01:03:23.093
Finn, the fleet
is running on fumes.

782
01:03:24.076 --> 01:03:26.729
Without a codebreaker to break us
onto Snoke's Star Destroyer...

783
01:03:28.036 --> 01:03:29.628
What do we do?
I don't know.

784
01:03:30.196 --> 01:03:32.690
Unless you got a thief in your pocket,
our plan is shot.

785
01:03:34.876 --> 01:03:36.195
I can do it.

786
01:03:40.356 --> 01:03:41.356
What?

787
01:03:43.036 --> 01:03:44.051
What?

788
01:03:45.116 --> 01:03:46.116
What?

789
01:03:46.276 --> 01:03:47.568
Sorry, I just...

790
01:03:48.376 --> 01:03:50.312
couldn't help but overhear all the stuff

791
01:03:50.396 --> 01:03:53.054
that you were saying really loudly...

792
01:03:54.036 --> 01:03:55.389
while I was trying to sleep.

793
01:03:57.596 --> 01:03:58.995
Codebreaker?

794
01:03:59.956 --> 01:04:00.989
Thief?

795
01:04:02.356 --> 01:04:03.550
I can do it.

796
01:04:03.716 --> 01:04:05.969
We're not talking about
picking pockets, ok?

797
01:04:07.516 --> 01:04:09.027
Yeah.

798
01:04:11.396 --> 01:04:13.352
Don't let the wrapper fool you, friend.

799
01:04:14.076 --> 01:04:16.216
Me and the First Order codeage...

800
01:04:16.717 --> 01:04:18.091
go way back.

801
01:04:19.516 --> 01:04:20.551
And...

802
01:04:22.276 --> 01:04:23.853
if the price is right,

803
01:04:25.476 --> 01:04:26.960
I could break you,

804
01:04:26.961 --> 01:04:30.211
into old man Snoke's boudoir.

805
01:04:32.116 --> 01:04:33.124
No.
We're...

806
01:04:33.125 --> 01:04:33.993
We got it covered.

807
01:04:37.636 --> 01:04:38.910
Hatukga.

808
01:04:52.396 --> 01:04:53.748
Did he just...
Yeah.

809
01:04:55.716 --> 01:04:57.354
We gotta get out of here!
This way!

810
01:04:57.516 --> 01:04:58.585
Why you little...

811
01:05:03.716 --> 01:05:05.513
Did you do this?

812
01:05:08.636 --> 01:05:09.671
Hey, hands up!

813
01:05:10.836 --> 01:05:11.981
Hands up!

814
01:05:11.982 --> 01:05:13.066
Yeah, man.

815
01:05:29.296 --> 01:05:30.788
What's your story, roundie?

816
01:05:31.516 --> 01:05:32.585
They went this way!

817
01:05:37.356 --> 01:05:39.147
Lock down all the exits.
Wait.

818
01:05:43.916 --> 01:05:45.108
That smelled great.

819
01:05:45.676 --> 01:05:47.076
Those cops will be here any minute.

820
01:05:47.077 --> 01:05:47.507
What now?

821
01:06:20.836 --> 01:06:22.254
No, wait.
Please, don't!

822
01:06:29.956 --> 01:06:31.236
We're with the Resistance.

823
01:06:37.196 --> 01:06:39.152
Roger that.
Checking the stables now.

824
01:06:46.076 --> 01:06:47.836
This way. They must
have come through here.

825
01:07:01.196 --> 01:07:02.496
Go, go, go, go!

826
01:07:09.316 --> 01:07:11.336
Stop enjoying this!
Stop enjoying this!

827
01:07:17.316 --> 01:07:19.497
<i>We've got them.
They're not going anywhere.</i>

828
01:08:03.796 --> 01:08:05.276
Move, move, move!
Get out of the way!

829
01:08:07.236 --> 01:08:09.366
Our ship's on the beach.
Straight ahead!

830
01:08:11.476 --> 01:08:12.476
We need cover!

831
01:08:23.356 --> 01:08:24.430
Too much cover!

832
01:08:37.156 --> 01:08:38.171
There it is!

833
01:08:40.956 --> 01:08:42.787
No!
Come on!

834
01:08:58.036 --> 01:09:00.016
Let the herd go.
Stick with the perps.

835
01:09:05.596 --> 01:09:06.631
Where'd they go?

836
01:09:09.876 --> 01:09:10.945
I think we lost him!

837
01:09:11.116 --> 01:09:12.932
Now we get down to the beach
and circle back around...

838
01:09:12.956 --> 01:09:13.956
Cliff!

839
01:09:24.116 --> 01:09:25.151
We're trapped.

840
01:09:28.116 --> 01:09:29.310
It was worth it, though.

841
01:09:29.956 --> 01:09:31.230
To tear up that town,

842
01:09:31.596 --> 01:09:32.824
make them hurt.

843
01:09:42.436 --> 01:09:43.436
Go.

844
01:09:48.476 --> 01:09:49.704
Now it's worth it.

845
01:09:59.996 --> 01:10:01.196
There they are.

846
01:10:06.636 --> 01:10:09.150
BB-8! Wait, are you flying that thing?

847
01:10:15.196 --> 01:10:16.668
Need a lift?

848
01:11:10.756 --> 01:11:11.756
Luke.

849
01:11:13.076 --> 01:11:14.225
Leia.

850
01:11:23.076 --> 01:11:24.953
I'd rather not do this now.

851
01:11:25.636 --> 01:11:26.789
Yeah me too.

852
01:11:29.356 --> 01:11:30.848
Why did you hate your father?

853
01:11:35.396 --> 01:11:37.896
Do you have something, a cowl
or something you could put on?

854
01:11:41.576 --> 01:11:43.951
Why did you hate your father?
Give me an honest answer.

855
01:11:45.556 --> 01:11:48.070
You had a father who loved you,
he gave a damn about you.

856
01:11:48.276 --> 01:11:50.312
I didn't hate him.
Then why?

857
01:11:50.716 --> 01:11:51.716
Why what?

858
01:11:55.236 --> 01:11:56.669
Why what? Say it.

859
01:11:57.996 --> 01:11:59.015
Why did you...

860
01:12:00.116 --> 01:12:01.472
Why did you kill him?

861
01:12:02.516 --> 01:12:03.710
I don't understand.

862
01:12:03.876 --> 01:12:04.876
No?

863
01:12:05.036 --> 01:12:06.636
Your parents threw you away
like garbage.

864
01:12:06.836 --> 01:12:08.306
They didn't!
They did.

865
01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.197
But you can't stop needing them.

866
01:12:11.036 --> 01:12:12.264
It's your greatest weakness.

867
01:12:13.116 --> 01:12:14.236
Looking for them everywhere,

868
01:12:14.356 --> 01:12:15.450
in Han Solo,

869
01:12:16.036 --> 01:12:17.533
now in Skywalker.

870
01:12:21.236 --> 01:12:22.933
Did he tell you what happened
that night?

871
01:12:23.396 --> 01:12:24.396
Yes.

872
01:12:26.476 --> 01:12:27.545
No.

873
01:12:29.316 --> 01:12:30.954
He had sensed my power,

874
01:12:32.276 --> 01:12:33.794
as he senses yours.

875
01:12:35.276 --> 01:12:36.748
And he feared it.

876
01:12:53.796 --> 01:12:55.070
Liar.

877
01:12:59.516 --> 01:13:00.869
Let the past die.

878
01:13:02.476 --> 01:13:04.385
Kill it if you have to.

879
01:13:07.356 --> 01:13:09.675
That's the only way to become
what you were meant to be.

880
01:13:53.276 --> 01:13:55.187
No! No!

881
01:14:35.676 --> 01:14:37.075
Rey?

882
01:15:06.156 --> 01:15:08.329
I should have felt trapped or panicked.

883
01:15:08.996 --> 01:15:10.175
But I didn't.

884
01:15:13.876 --> 01:15:16.606
This didn't go on forever,
I knew it was leading somewhere.

885
01:15:17.876 --> 01:15:20.244
And that, at the end,
it would show me what I came to see.

886
01:15:22.516 --> 01:15:23.915
Rey.

887
01:15:32.436 --> 01:15:34.331
Let me see them.

888
01:15:35.116 --> 01:15:37.107
My parents,

889
01:15:37.276 --> 01:15:39.046
please.

890
01:16:14.476 --> 01:16:16.546
I thought I'd find answers here.

891
01:16:18.156 --> 01:16:19.209
I was wrong.

892
01:16:22.076 --> 01:16:23.728
I'd never felt so alone.

893
01:16:26.356 --> 01:16:27.555
You're not alone.

894
01:16:32.876 --> 01:16:34.095
Neither are you.

895
01:16:35.236 --> 01:16:36.555
Rey?

896
01:16:44.356 --> 01:16:45.828
It isn't too late.

897
01:17:43.756 --> 01:17:44.791
Stop!

898
01:17:54.156 --> 01:17:57.068
Is it true?
Did you try to murder him?

899
01:17:57.236 --> 01:17:59.370
Leave this island now!

900
01:17:59.836 --> 01:18:00.836
Stop.

901
01:18:02.316 --> 01:18:03.316
Stop!

902
01:18:07.876 --> 01:18:08.945
Did you do it?

903
01:18:09.156 --> 01:18:10.847
Did you create Kylo Ren?

904
01:18:40.836 --> 01:18:42.216
Tell me the truth.

905
01:18:48.636 --> 01:18:50.092
I saw darkness.

906
01:18:52.396 --> 01:18:54.207
I'd sensed it building in him.

907
01:18:54.476 --> 01:18:57.115
I'd seen it in moments
during his training.

908
01:18:57.636 --> 01:18:59.467
But then I looked inside,

909
01:18:59.916 --> 01:19:02.669
and it was beyond
what I ever imagined.

910
01:19:07.916 --> 01:19:10.066
Snoke had already turned his heart.

911
01:19:11.756 --> 01:19:14.509
He would bring destruction,
and pain, and death,

912
01:19:14.596 --> 01:19:17.633
and the end of everything I love
because of what he will become.

913
01:19:17.634 --> 01:19:19.593
And for the briefest moment
of pure instinct,

914
01:19:19.676 --> 01:19:20.851
I thought I could stop it.

915
01:19:24.036 --> 01:19:26.204
It passed like a fleeting shadow.

916
01:19:27.396 --> 01:19:29.173
And I was left with shame,

917
01:19:30.596 --> 01:19:32.452
and with consequence.

918
01:19:33.316 --> 01:19:35.193
And the last thing I saw...

919
01:19:35.716 --> 01:19:37.627
were the eyes of a frightened boy

920
01:19:37.716 --> 01:19:39.984
whose master had failed him.

921
01:19:41.876 --> 01:19:42.876
Ben, no!

922
01:19:49.796 --> 01:19:52.212
You failed him by thinking
his choice was made.

923
01:19:52.296 --> 01:19:53.296
It wasn't.

924
01:19:53.436 --> 01:19:55.033
There's still conflict in him.

925
01:19:55.396 --> 01:19:58.035
If he were turned from the dark side,
that could shift the tide.

926
01:19:58.196 --> 01:19:59.848
This could be how we win.

927
01:20:00.116 --> 01:20:03.108
This is not going to go
the way you think.

928
01:20:03.636 --> 01:20:04.664
It is.

929
01:20:05.076 --> 01:20:07.329
Just now when we touched hands,

930
01:20:07.996 --> 01:20:09.470
I saw his future.

931
01:20:10.276 --> 01:20:12.014
As solid as I'm seeing you.

932
01:20:12.396 --> 01:20:15.811
If I go to him, Ben Solo will turn.

933
01:20:16.116 --> 01:20:17.116
Rey,

934
01:20:17.716 --> 01:20:19.486
don't do this.

935
01:20:35.676 --> 01:20:37.268
Then he's our last hope.

936
01:21:18.356 --> 01:21:19.789
Master Yoda.

937
01:21:20.636 --> 01:21:23.070
Young Skywalker.

938
01:21:25.356 --> 01:21:26.789
I'm ending all of this.

939
01:21:27.116 --> 01:21:29.384
The tree, the text, the Jedi.

940
01:21:29.756 --> 01:21:30.950
I'm gonna burn it down.

941
01:22:08.356 --> 01:22:09.789
Skywalker.

942
01:22:09.876 --> 01:22:10.911
Missed you, have I.

943
01:22:24.116 --> 01:22:25.354
So it is time...

944
01:22:27.316 --> 01:22:29.113
for the Jedi Order to end.

945
01:22:29.276 --> 01:22:31.506
Time it is.

946
01:22:36.236 --> 01:22:41.133
For you to look past
a pile of old books?

947
01:22:41.916 --> 01:22:43.668
The sacred Jedi texts.

948
01:22:45.136 --> 01:22:46.286
Read them, have you?

949
01:22:46.716 --> 01:22:48.149
Well, I...
Page-turners

950
01:22:48.656 --> 01:22:49.684
they were not.

951
01:22:50.236 --> 01:22:52.113
Yes, yes, yes.

952
01:22:52.316 --> 01:22:53.635
Wisdom they held,

953
01:22:53.796 --> 01:22:55.896
but that library contained nothing,

954
01:22:55.897 --> 01:22:59.247
that the girl Rey
does not already possess.

955
01:23:02.516 --> 01:23:03.888
Skywalker,

956
01:23:04.916 --> 01:23:06.827
still looking to the horizon.

957
01:23:07.296 --> 01:23:09.064
Never here, now?

958
01:23:09.876 --> 01:23:12.436
The need in front of your nose.

959
01:23:16.116 --> 01:23:17.354
I was weak.

960
01:23:18.996 --> 01:23:19.996
Unwise.

961
01:23:20.156 --> 01:23:22.716
Lost Ben Solo, you did.

962
01:23:23.436 --> 01:23:25.570
Lose Rey, we must not.

963
01:23:26.316 --> 01:23:29.114
I can't be what she needs me to be.

964
01:23:29.756 --> 01:23:31.951
Heeded my words not, did you?

965
01:23:32.396 --> 01:23:34.810
Pass on what you have learned.

966
01:23:35.076 --> 01:23:37.192
Strength, mastery.

967
01:23:38.156 --> 01:23:39.748
But weakness,

968
01:23:39.916 --> 01:23:42.305
folly, failure also.

969
01:23:42.476 --> 01:23:44.993
Yes, failure most of all.

970
01:23:45.456 --> 01:23:48.414
The greatest teacher, failure is.

971
01:23:58.036 --> 01:23:59.036
Luke,

972
01:24:01.636 --> 01:24:04.726
we are what they grow beyond.

973
01:24:05.796 --> 01:24:09.594
That is the true burden of all masters.

974
01:24:23.236 --> 01:24:25.192
Four parsecs to go.
This thing really cooks.

975
01:24:25.356 --> 01:24:26.728
I just hope we're in time.

976
01:24:27.196 --> 01:24:28.595
You can actually do this, right?

977
01:24:29.156 --> 01:24:31.147
Yeah, about that...

978
01:24:34.916 --> 01:24:37.852
Guys, I can do it.

979
01:24:39.276 --> 01:24:41.995
But there exists a predo it
conversation about price.

980
01:24:42.756 --> 01:24:45.176
Once we're done, the Resistance
will give you whatever you want.

981
01:24:45.996 --> 01:24:47.036
What you got deposit wise?

982
01:24:47.916 --> 01:24:49.184
Are you kidding me?

983
01:24:49.185 --> 01:24:50.111
Look at us.

984
01:24:51.196 --> 01:24:52.948
Is that Haysian smelt?

985
01:24:55.596 --> 01:24:56.715
That's something.

986
01:24:57.076 --> 01:24:59.271
No, we gave you our word.
You're gonna get paid.

987
01:24:59.396 --> 01:25:00.590
That should be enough.

988
01:25:00.591 --> 01:25:02.330
Guys, I wanna keep helping.

989
01:25:03.156 --> 01:25:06.626
But no something, no doing.

990
01:25:06.796 --> 01:25:08.587
Ok, listen here, you've got...

991
01:25:09.356 --> 01:25:10.494
Do it.

992
01:25:14.036 --> 01:25:15.333
Now I can help.

993
01:25:18.316 --> 01:25:19.385
Give it back.

994
01:25:20.876 --> 01:25:21.876
What?

995
01:25:22.156 --> 01:25:23.826
Give it back!

996
01:25:24.196 --> 01:25:26.316
You have no idea how much
that medallion means to her.

997
01:25:26.636 --> 01:25:29.173
What are you... Why are you
ransacking your own ship?

998
01:25:32.116 --> 01:25:33.185
It's not your ship.

999
01:25:34.996 --> 01:25:36.031
He says I stole it.

1000
01:25:36.196 --> 01:25:37.483
Yeah, I got that.

1001
01:25:37.484 --> 01:25:38.391
We stole it.

1002
01:25:40.316 --> 01:25:42.146
At least you're stealing
from the bad guys...

1003
01:25:43.196 --> 01:25:44.196
and helping the good.

1004
01:25:44.356 --> 01:25:46.312
Good guys, bad guys,

1005
01:25:46.476 --> 01:25:47.612
made up words.

1006
01:25:49.236 --> 01:25:52.785
Let's see who formerly owned
this gorgeous hunk.

1007
01:25:55.916 --> 01:25:58.111
This guy was an arms dealer.

1008
01:25:58.916 --> 01:26:01.913
Made his bank selling weapons
to the bad guys.

1009
01:26:06.436 --> 01:26:07.615
And the good.

1010
01:26:09.356 --> 01:26:12.168
Finn, let me learn you something big.

1011
01:26:13.676 --> 01:26:15.892
It's all a machine, partner.

1012
01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:19.833
Live free, don't join.

1013
01:26:32.356 --> 01:26:34.445
That was the last of their support ships.

1014
01:26:34.956 --> 01:26:36.276
It's just their main cruiser now.

1015
01:26:36.656 --> 01:26:37.935
And their fuel reserve?

1016
01:26:38.196 --> 01:26:39.714
By our calculation,

1017
01:26:40.076 --> 01:26:41.155
critical.

1018
01:26:45.796 --> 01:26:46.796
She in there?

1019
01:26:46.876 --> 01:26:47.972
The admiral's banned you
from the bridge.

1020
01:26:47.996 --> 01:26:49.076
Let's not have a scene.
No, let's.

1021
01:26:49.596 --> 01:26:51.427
Holdo?
You're not allowed in here.

1022
01:26:51.428 --> 01:26:52.258
Flyboy.

1023
01:26:52.259 --> 01:26:53.345
Cut it, lady.

1024
01:26:54.036 --> 01:26:55.935
We had a fleet,
now we're down to one ship,

1025
01:26:55.936 --> 01:26:57.454
and you've told us nothing!

1026
01:26:58.036 --> 01:27:00.567
Tell us that we have a plan!

1027
01:27:01.436 --> 01:27:02.436
That there is hope!

1028
01:27:02.596 --> 01:27:03.995
When I served under Leia,

1029
01:27:04.156 --> 01:27:06.624
she would say, hope is like the sun.

1030
01:27:07.096 --> 01:27:09.410
If you only believe in it
when you can see it...

1031
01:27:09.476 --> 01:27:11.306
You'll never make it through the night.

1032
01:27:12.156 --> 01:27:13.475
Yes.

1033
01:27:21.476 --> 01:27:23.592
Are you fueling up the transports?

1034
01:27:29.116 --> 01:27:30.190
You are.

1035
01:27:31.116 --> 01:27:32.244
All of them?

1036
01:27:33.636 --> 01:27:35.162
We're abandoning ship?

1037
01:27:35.163 --> 01:27:36.163
Is that...

1038
01:27:36.636 --> 01:27:38.636
That's what you got?
That's what you brought us to?

1039
01:27:39.236 --> 01:27:40.236
Coward!

1040
01:27:41.116 --> 01:27:44.094
Those transport ships
are unarmed, unshielded.

1041
01:27:44.156 --> 01:27:46.431
We abandon this cruiser, we're done.

1042
01:27:46.432 --> 01:27:47.686
We don't stand a chance.

1043
01:27:47.687 --> 01:27:49.315
No, you are not just a coward,

1044
01:27:49.476 --> 01:27:50.689
you are a traitor.

1045
01:27:51.716 --> 01:27:53.646
Get this man off my bridge.

1046
01:28:00.756 --> 01:28:03.132
<i>Finn, Holdo's loading
the crew in the shuttle.</i>

1047
01:28:03.156 --> 01:28:05.415
<i>She's going to abandon ship.
Where are you?</i>

1048
01:28:05.416 --> 01:28:07.134
Poe, we're on our way
back to the fleet.

1049
01:28:07.196 --> 01:28:08.245
We're so close.

1050
01:28:08.316 --> 01:28:09.492
Did you find the Master Codebreaker?

1051
01:28:09.516 --> 01:28:11.632
Well, we found a codebreaker.

1052
01:28:12.076 --> 01:28:13.312
<i>We can shut the tracker down.</i>

1053
01:28:13.436 --> 01:28:15.027
<i>Just buy us a little more time.</i>

1054
01:28:16.316 --> 01:28:17.454
Alright. Hurry.

1055
01:28:23.156 --> 01:28:25.036
As soon as I launch,
you jump back out of range.

1056
01:28:25.376 --> 01:28:27.829
Stay there until you get my signal
for where to rendezvous.

1057
01:28:29.636 --> 01:28:31.834
If you see Finn before I do,

1058
01:28:32.516 --> 01:28:33.516
tell him...

1059
01:28:35.716 --> 01:28:37.468
Yeah, perfect.
Tell him that.

1060
01:29:44.476 --> 01:29:45.845
Cloaking our approach.

1061
01:29:45.846 --> 01:29:47.185
We should be off their scopes.

1062
01:29:47.596 --> 01:29:49.905
Then we slice a slit in their shield.

1063
01:29:50.076 --> 01:29:51.414
Blip bloppity bloop,

1064
01:29:52.756 --> 01:29:54.512
and slip right through.

1065
01:30:13.156 --> 01:30:16.273
So a stormtrooper
and a who now are doing what?

1066
01:30:16.336 --> 01:30:17.799
They are trying to save us.

1067
01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:19.392
This is our best chance for escape.

1068
01:30:19.556 --> 01:30:21.612
You have to give Finn and Rose
all the time that you can.

1069
01:30:21.636 --> 01:30:23.991
You have bet the survival
of the Resistance

1070
01:30:24.156 --> 01:30:26.409
on bad odds and put us all at risk.

1071
01:30:27.076 --> 01:30:28.325
There's no time now.

1072
01:30:28.436 --> 01:30:30.915
We have to get clear of the cruiser.
Load the transports.

1073
01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:31.556
Right away, admiral.

1074
01:30:31.596 --> 01:30:32.772
Yeah, I was afraid you'd say that.

1075
01:30:33.296 --> 01:30:34.752
Vice Admiral Holdo,

1076
01:30:34.836 --> 01:30:36.633
I am relieving you
of your command

1077
01:30:36.796 --> 01:30:39.572
for the survival of this ship,
its crew and the Resistance.

1078
01:30:40.956 --> 01:30:42.886
I hope you understand
what you're doing.

1079
01:30:43.716 --> 01:30:44.716
Yeah.

1080
01:30:44.956 --> 01:30:46.012
I'm going to the bridge.

1081
01:30:46.236 --> 01:30:47.827
If they move, stun them.

1082
01:31:08.156 --> 01:31:09.908
At least three cycles so far.

1083
01:31:10.076 --> 01:31:11.656
Yes, sir.
We are working on it.

1084
01:31:18.796 --> 01:31:20.707
I will do my best, sir.

1085
01:31:30.916 --> 01:31:32.110
Almost there.

1086
01:31:41.276 --> 01:31:42.728
You don't have to do this.

1087
01:31:43.596 --> 01:31:45.288
I feel the conflict in you.

1088
01:31:45.356 --> 01:31:46.774
It's tearing you apart.

1089
01:31:48.116 --> 01:31:49.161
Ben,

1090
01:31:49.462 --> 01:31:51.949
when we touched hands,
I saw your future.

1091
01:31:52.356 --> 01:31:54.745
Just the shape of it,
but solid and clear.

1092
01:31:55.316 --> 01:31:57.346
You will not bow before Snoke.

1093
01:32:00.596 --> 01:32:01.854
You'll turn.

1094
01:32:04.396 --> 01:32:05.634
I'll help you.

1095
01:32:06.596 --> 01:32:07.709
I saw it.

1096
01:32:08.276 --> 01:32:09.814
I saw something, too.

1097
01:32:11.356 --> 01:32:12.356
Because of what I saw,

1098
01:32:12.516 --> 01:32:14.950
I know when the moment comes,
you'll be the one to turn.

1099
01:32:15.676 --> 01:32:17.273
You'll stand with me.

1100
01:32:18.156 --> 01:32:19.156
Rey,

1101
01:32:20.356 --> 01:32:22.265
I saw who your parents are.

1102
01:32:37.556 --> 01:32:41.868
Well done, my good
and faithful apprentice.

1103
01:32:42.036 --> 01:32:45.834
My faith in you is restored.

1104
01:32:47.356 --> 01:32:49.586
Young Rey.

1105
01:32:51.716 --> 01:32:53.274
Welcome.

1106
01:32:58.636 --> 01:32:59.810
So this is it.

1107
01:33:00.276 --> 01:33:01.753
The tracker's right behind this door.

1108
01:33:15.156 --> 01:33:17.272
Haysian smelt.

1109
01:33:17.716 --> 01:33:19.015
Best conductor.

1110
01:33:27.716 --> 01:33:29.129
And you're welcome.

1111
01:33:31.316 --> 01:33:33.212
Good time to figure out
how we get back to the fleet?

1112
01:33:33.436 --> 01:33:34.908
I know where the nearest
escape pods are.

1113
01:33:34.996 --> 01:33:35.996
Course you do.

1114
01:33:36.276 --> 01:33:37.873
<i>BB-8, tell me something good.</i>

1115
01:33:39.756 --> 01:33:40.950
Poe, we're almost there.

1116
01:33:41.116 --> 01:33:42.652
<i>Have the cruiser prepped
for lightspeed.</i>

1117
01:33:42.676 --> 01:33:44.406
Yeah, I'm on it, pal.
You just hurry.

1118
01:33:46.616 --> 01:33:48.995
Clear the bridge, escort the
officers down to the hangar.

1119
01:33:48.996 --> 01:33:50.509
Commander...
Captain Dameron,

1120
01:33:50.796 --> 01:33:52.573
Admiral Holdo was looking for you.

1121
01:33:52.636 --> 01:33:53.685
Yeah, we spoke.

1122
01:33:55.236 --> 01:33:57.466
Sir, I am almost afraid to ask.

1123
01:33:57.636 --> 01:33:59.467
Good instinct, Threepio.
Go with that.

1124
01:34:12.236 --> 01:34:13.236
Seal that door!

1125
01:34:16.036 --> 01:34:17.076
We're running out of time.

1126
01:34:17.156 --> 01:34:18.384
Come on, how's it going?

1127
01:34:18.556 --> 01:34:20.114
Almost there.

1128
01:34:21.156 --> 01:34:23.355
Threepio, where do you think
you're going?

1129
01:34:23.456 --> 01:34:25.247
It would be quite against
my programming

1130
01:34:25.316 --> 01:34:27.034
to be party to a mutiny.
Hey!

1131
01:34:27.196 --> 01:34:29.027
It is not correct protocol.

1132
01:34:30.896 --> 01:34:32.210
Neither is this!

1133
01:34:32.396 --> 01:34:33.372
Finn?

1134
01:34:33.373 --> 01:34:34.452
<i>We're ready to make the jump!</i>

1135
01:34:34.556 --> 01:34:35.584
Now or never.

1136
01:34:39.356 --> 01:34:40.356
Now.

1137
01:34:47.896 --> 01:34:48.896
You're up.

1138
01:35:06.596 --> 01:35:08.852
<i>You there, hands up!
Watch them, watch them.</i>

1139
01:35:08.876 --> 01:35:10.972
<i>Drop your weapons, now!
Hands up, Rebel scum.</i>

1140
01:35:10.996 --> 01:35:12.468
<i>Get down! I said, down!</i>

1141
01:35:22.436 --> 01:35:24.233
<i>FN-2187.</i>

1142
01:35:26.116 --> 01:35:28.371
<i>So good to have you back.</i>

1143
01:35:29.316 --> 01:35:30.431
They didn't make it.

1144
01:35:44.556 --> 01:35:45.671
Leia.

1145
01:35:56.956 --> 01:35:58.412
<i>Please board the transports</i>

1146
01:35:58.436 --> 01:36:00.711
<i>according to your
evacuation designation.</i>

1147
01:36:02.056 --> 01:36:03.392
Ok, help me push him up, guys.

1148
01:36:03.516 --> 01:36:05.016
That one's a troublemaker.

1149
01:36:05.636 --> 01:36:06.664
I like him.

1150
01:36:07.596 --> 01:36:08.631
Me, too.

1151
01:36:09.356 --> 01:36:11.747
Now, time to board your transport.

1152
01:36:12.516 --> 01:36:14.154
For the transports to escape,

1153
01:36:15.156 --> 01:36:17.814
someone needs to stay behind
and pilot the cruiser.

1154
01:36:22.716 --> 01:36:24.274
Too many losses.

1155
01:36:25.956 --> 01:36:27.872
I can't take any more.

1156
01:36:28.436 --> 01:36:29.710
Sure you can.

1157
01:36:31.116 --> 01:36:32.452
You taught me how.

1158
01:36:35.596 --> 01:36:36.870
May the Force be...

1159
01:36:38.916 --> 01:36:40.634
You go on.
I've said it enough.

1160
01:36:42.396 --> 01:36:45.466
May the Force be with you always.

1161
01:36:52.596 --> 01:36:53.932
<i>Cloaking device activated.</i>

1162
01:36:53.956 --> 01:36:55.287
<i>We should be off their scopes.</i>

1163
01:36:55.956 --> 01:36:57.545
Let's hope this works.

1164
01:37:14.996 --> 01:37:17.071
Come closer, child.

1165
01:37:20.076 --> 01:37:22.490
So much strength.

1166
01:37:22.956 --> 01:37:26.028
Darkness rises,

1167
01:37:26.236 --> 01:37:29.945
and light to meet it.

1168
01:37:30.876 --> 01:37:34.789
I warned my young apprentice
that as he grew stronger,

1169
01:37:35.116 --> 01:37:37.676
his equal in the light would rise.

1170
01:37:40.276 --> 01:37:41.345
Skywalker...

1171
01:37:41.736 --> 01:37:43.067
I assumed.

1172
01:37:44.356 --> 01:37:45.356
Wrongly.

1173
01:37:48.596 --> 01:37:50.093
Closer, I said.

1174
01:37:57.196 --> 01:37:58.948
You underestimate Skywalker,

1175
01:37:59.676 --> 01:38:00.791
and Ben Solo,

1176
01:38:01.476 --> 01:38:02.550
and me.

1177
01:38:03.356 --> 01:38:05.167
It will be your downfall.

1178
01:38:06.916 --> 01:38:08.527
Have you seen something?

1179
01:38:09.276 --> 01:38:12.234
A weakness in my apprentice.

1180
01:38:12.396 --> 01:38:14.087
Is that why you came?

1181
01:38:17.156 --> 01:38:18.528
Young fool.

1182
01:38:19.036 --> 01:38:22.611
It was I who bridged your minds.

1183
01:38:23.156 --> 01:38:26.512
I stoked Ren's conflicted soul.

1184
01:38:26.676 --> 01:38:29.793
I knew he was not strong enough
to hide it from you.

1185
01:38:29.956 --> 01:38:35.189
And you were not wise enough
to resist the bait.

1186
01:38:38.756 --> 01:38:40.075
And now,

1187
01:38:40.636 --> 01:38:45.471
you will give me Skywalker.

1188
01:38:46.676 --> 01:38:49.010
Then I will kill you

1189
01:38:49.316 --> 01:38:51.989
with the cruelest stroke.

1190
01:38:52.836 --> 01:38:53.636
No.

1191
01:38:54.476 --> 01:38:55.504
Yes.

1192
01:38:59.756 --> 01:39:02.429
Give me

1193
01:39:03.756 --> 01:39:05.474
everything.

1194
01:39:06.036 --> 01:39:07.508
No! No!

1195
01:39:08.196 --> 01:39:09.231
No!

1196
01:39:16.316 --> 01:39:17.954
No. No.

1197
01:39:18.116 --> 01:39:19.210
No, no, no!

1198
01:39:24.236 --> 01:39:25.305
Poe.

1199
01:39:31.036 --> 01:39:32.036
What is that?

1200
01:39:32.196 --> 01:39:33.893
The mineral planet, Crait.

1201
01:39:34.156 --> 01:39:36.511
An uncharted hideout from
the days of the Rebellion.

1202
01:39:37.036 --> 01:39:39.013
That's a Rebel base?
Abandoned,

1203
01:39:39.396 --> 01:39:40.396
but heavily armored

1204
01:39:40.756 --> 01:39:43.012
with enough power to get a distress
signal to our allies

1205
01:39:43.036 --> 01:39:44.185
scattered in the Outer Rim.

1206
01:39:44.356 --> 01:39:46.153
Holdo knew the First Order

1207
01:39:46.154 --> 01:39:47.465
was tracking our big ship.

1208
01:39:47.636 --> 01:39:50.269
They're not monitoring
for little transports.

1209
01:39:50.996 --> 01:39:53.687
So we could slip down to
the surface unnoticed and...

1210
01:39:54.288 --> 01:39:56.232
hide till the First Order passes.

1211
01:39:58.796 --> 01:39:59.896
That could work.

1212
01:40:01.516 --> 01:40:03.472
She was more interested

1213
01:40:03.596 --> 01:40:05.651
in protecting the light than she was...

1214
01:40:06.516 --> 01:40:08.584
seeming like a hero.

1215
01:40:20.956 --> 01:40:22.230
Godspeed,

1216
01:40:22.516 --> 01:40:23.849
Rebels.

1217
01:40:53.676 --> 01:40:55.029
Well done, Phasma.

1218
01:40:56.156 --> 01:40:58.609
<i>Your ship and payment,
as we agreed.</i>

1219
01:41:06.796 --> 01:41:08.188
You lying snake.

1220
01:41:13.236 --> 01:41:15.211
We got caught,

1221
01:41:16.196 --> 01:41:18.266
I cut a deal.

1222
01:41:19.076 --> 01:41:20.076
Wait,

1223
01:41:20.796 --> 01:41:22.115
cut a deal with what?

1224
01:41:22.116 --> 01:41:23.936
Sir, we checked on the
information from the thief.

1225
01:41:24.396 --> 01:41:26.830
We ran a decloaking scan,
and sure enough,

1226
01:41:26.996 --> 01:41:29.496
30 Resistance transports
have just launched from the cruiser.

1227
01:41:30.516 --> 01:41:32.266
He told us the truth.

1228
01:41:33.476 --> 01:41:35.148
Will wonders never cease?

1229
01:41:35.556 --> 01:41:36.256
No.

1230
01:41:36.796 --> 01:41:37.796
Our weapons are ready?

1231
01:41:37.956 --> 01:41:39.009
Ready and aimed, sir.

1232
01:41:40.156 --> 01:41:41.294
Fire at will.

1233
01:41:42.516 --> 01:41:44.029
Wait. No, no.
No, you can't!

1234
01:41:44.596 --> 01:41:45.649
No!

1235
01:42:00.116 --> 01:42:01.708
<i>Admiral, we're taking fire!</i>

1236
01:42:01.709 --> 01:42:03.452
<i>Do we turn around?</i>
No, you're too far out.

1237
01:42:03.976 --> 01:42:06.076
Full speed to planetfall.
Full speed!

1238
01:42:12.076 --> 01:42:14.112
Well, well,

1239
01:42:14.196 --> 01:42:17.950
I did not expect Skywalker
to be so wise.

1240
01:42:18.556 --> 01:42:21.116
We will give him and the Jedi Order

1241
01:42:21.316 --> 01:42:23.571
the death he desires.

1242
01:42:24.316 --> 01:42:25.544
After the Rebels are gone,

1243
01:42:25.716 --> 01:42:27.195
we will go to his planet

1244
01:42:27.356 --> 01:42:30.990
and obliterate the entire island.

1245
01:42:37.996 --> 01:42:39.395
Such spunk.

1246
01:42:40.076 --> 01:42:41.191
Look here now.

1247
01:42:48.636 --> 01:42:53.264
The entire Resistance
on those transports...

1248
01:42:54.316 --> 01:42:57.925
Soon they will all be gone.

1249
01:42:58.396 --> 01:43:01.513
For you, all is lost.

1250
01:43:07.156 --> 01:43:09.849
Still that fiery spit of hope.

1251
01:43:11.196 --> 01:43:14.347
You have the spirit of a true Jedi!

1252
01:43:22.836 --> 01:43:24.155
And because of that,

1253
01:43:25.276 --> 01:43:26.675
you must die.

1254
01:43:29.476 --> 01:43:31.526
My worthy apprentice,

1255
01:43:31.796 --> 01:43:35.550
son of darkness,
heir apparent to Lord Vader.

1256
01:43:35.716 --> 01:43:39.152
Where there was conflict,
I now sense resolve.

1257
01:43:39.356 --> 01:43:42.029
Where there was weakness, strength.

1258
01:43:42.836 --> 01:43:44.428
Complete your training,

1259
01:43:44.756 --> 01:43:48.747
and fulfill your destiny.

1260
01:43:58.396 --> 01:43:59.968
I know what I have to do.

1261
01:44:02.116 --> 01:44:03.116
Ben.

1262
01:44:04.916 --> 01:44:07.111
You think you can turn him?

1263
01:44:07.676 --> 01:44:09.373
Pathetic child.

1264
01:44:11.036 --> 01:44:13.425
I cannot be betrayed,

1265
01:44:13.636 --> 01:44:15.572
I cannot be beaten.

1266
01:44:15.836 --> 01:44:18.091
I see his mind,

1267
01:44:18.356 --> 01:44:21.428
I see his every intent.

1268
01:44:21.716 --> 01:44:22.816
Yes.

1269
01:44:24.036 --> 01:44:29.713
I see him turning
the lightsaber to strike true.

1270
01:44:30.276 --> 01:44:31.345
And now,

1271
01:44:32.156 --> 01:44:34.033
foolish child,

1272
01:44:34.196 --> 01:44:36.052
he ignites it,

1273
01:44:36.796 --> 01:44:40.345
and kills his true enemy!

1274
01:45:21.476 --> 01:45:23.196
Come on, give it full thrusters.
Full speed!

1275
01:45:23.356 --> 01:45:24.455
I am, sir.

1276
01:45:27.436 --> 01:45:28.949
You murdering bastard!

1277
01:45:30.096 --> 01:45:31.746
Take it easy, Big F.

1278
01:45:32.196 --> 01:45:34.929
They blow you up today,
you blow them up tomorrow.

1279
01:45:35.756 --> 01:45:37.294
It's just business.

1280
01:45:39.956 --> 01:45:41.050
You're wrong.

1281
01:45:44.836 --> 01:45:45.871
Maybe.

1282
01:47:29.356 --> 01:47:30.356
Ben!

1283
01:47:42.636 --> 01:47:43.685
The fleet.

1284
01:47:43.956 --> 01:47:44.996
Order them to stop firing.

1285
01:47:45.116 --> 01:47:46.613
There's still time to save the fleet.

1286
01:47:55.636 --> 01:47:56.705
Ben?

1287
01:47:58.916 --> 01:48:00.672
It's time to let old things die.

1288
01:48:03.436 --> 01:48:04.436
Snoke.

1289
01:48:04.876 --> 01:48:06.050
Skywalker.

1290
01:48:08.196 --> 01:48:09.349
The Sith.

1291
01:48:10.236 --> 01:48:11.225
The Jedi.

1292
01:48:11.226 --> 01:48:13.289
The Rebels, let it all die.

1293
01:48:14.236 --> 01:48:15.236
Rey.

1294
01:48:17.316 --> 01:48:18.595
I want you to join me.

1295
01:48:20.756 --> 01:48:23.316
We can rule together
and bring a new order to the galaxy.

1296
01:48:23.476 --> 01:48:24.775
Don't do this, Ben.

1297
01:48:26.036 --> 01:48:27.105
Please don't go this way.

1298
01:48:27.276 --> 01:48:29.807
No, no. You're still holding on!

1299
01:48:29.808 --> 01:48:30.746
Let go!

1300
01:48:31.916 --> 01:48:33.691
Do you wanna know the truth
about your parents?

1301
01:48:35.196 --> 01:48:36.595
Or have you always known?

1302
01:48:38.946 --> 01:48:40.504
And you've just hidden it away.

1303
01:48:42.796 --> 01:48:44.109
You know the truth.

1304
01:48:45.156 --> 01:48:46.389
Say it.

1305
01:48:49.716 --> 01:48:50.716
Say it.

1306
01:48:52.956 --> 01:48:54.269
They were nobody.

1307
01:48:54.636 --> 01:48:56.174
They were filthy junk traders,

1308
01:48:56.436 --> 01:48:58.347
who sold you off for drinking money.

1309
01:49:00.396 --> 01:49:03.413
They're dead in a paupers
grave in the Jakku desert.

1310
01:49:04.276 --> 01:49:06.132
You have no place in this story.

1311
01:49:06.133 --> 01:49:06.945
You come from nothing.

1312
01:49:07.346 --> 01:49:08.287
You're nothing.

1313
01:49:12.716 --> 01:49:13.790
But not to me.

1314
01:49:18.076 --> 01:49:19.076
Join me.

1315
01:49:32.556 --> 01:49:33.591
Please.

1316
01:50:03.996 --> 01:50:04.996
Sir,

1317
01:50:05.596 --> 01:50:08.149
the Resistance cruiser's
preparing to jump to lightspeed.

1318
01:50:09.156 --> 01:50:10.225
It's empty.

1319
01:50:10.396 --> 01:50:12.236
They're just trying
to pull our attention away.

1320
01:50:12.676 --> 01:50:13.825
Pathetic.

1321
01:50:13.826 --> 01:50:15.486
Keep your fire on the transports.

1322
01:50:44.036 --> 01:50:46.755
<i>Execution by blaster
is too good for them.</i>

1323
01:50:46.916 --> 01:50:48.752
<i>Let's make this hurt.</i>

1324
01:50:54.676 --> 01:50:55.676
Finn.

1325
01:51:00.316 --> 01:51:01.908
<i>On my command.</i>

1326
01:51:06.716 --> 01:51:07.990
She's running away.

1327
01:51:10.116 --> 01:51:11.116
No, she isn't.

1328
01:51:25.196 --> 01:51:26.298
No!

1329
01:51:26.299 --> 01:51:28.154
Fire on that cruiser!

1330
01:51:41.996 --> 01:51:42.996
<i>Execute.</i>

1331
01:52:27.116 --> 01:52:28.116
Finn!

1332
01:52:28.356 --> 01:52:30.734
There's a shuttle back that way!
We gotta go!

1333
01:52:46.636 --> 01:52:47.769
<i>Traitor!</i>

1334
01:52:49.756 --> 01:52:50.656
<i>What?</i>

1335
01:53:14.076 --> 01:53:15.076
Finn!

1336
01:53:34.476 --> 01:53:36.228
<i>You are a bug in the system.</i>

1337
01:53:36.596 --> 01:53:37.790
Let's go, chrome dome.

1338
01:53:45.476 --> 01:53:46.591
Come on!

1339
01:53:56.276 --> 01:53:57.276
No!

1340
01:54:03.236 --> 01:54:04.036
Hey.

1341
01:54:20.196 --> 01:54:22.535
You were always scum.

1342
01:54:24.396 --> 01:54:25.509
Rebel scum.

1343
01:54:39.396 --> 01:54:41.426
Hey! Need a lift?

1344
01:55:19.396 --> 01:55:21.512
What happened?

1345
01:55:22.116 --> 01:55:23.788
The girl murdered Snoke.

1346
01:55:28.236 --> 01:55:29.589
What happened?

1347
01:55:29.756 --> 01:55:31.916
She took Snoke's escape craft.

1348
01:55:32.716 --> 01:55:34.115
We know where she's going.

1349
01:55:35.116 --> 01:55:37.296
Get all our forces down
to that Resistance base.

1350
01:55:37.416 --> 01:55:38.549
Let's finish this.

1351
01:55:39.556 --> 01:55:40.705
Finish this?

1352
01:55:41.316 --> 01:55:43.486
Who do you think you're talking to?

1353
01:55:43.836 --> 01:55:46.350
You presume to command my army?

1354
01:55:47.116 --> 01:55:50.472
Our Supreme Leader is dead!
We have no ruler!

1355
01:55:54.996 --> 01:55:58.106
The Supreme Leader is dead.

1356
01:56:00.276 --> 01:56:03.293
Long live the Supreme Leader.

1357
01:56:21.236 --> 01:56:23.386
They're coming, shut the door.

1358
01:56:31.156 --> 01:56:32.828
Incoming!

1359
01:56:36.436 --> 01:56:38.313
Go! Go! Move!

1360
01:56:39.276 --> 01:56:41.032
Get that shield door down!

1361
01:56:57.076 --> 01:56:58.452
No! Wait, don't shoot! It's us!

1362
01:56:58.476 --> 01:56:59.511
No! Don't shoot!

1363
01:56:59.676 --> 01:57:00.676
Hold your fire!

1364
01:57:00.836 --> 01:57:02.572
Don't shoot!
Hold your fire!

1365
01:57:05.436 --> 01:57:06.664
Finn?
Finn!

1366
01:57:07.236 --> 01:57:08.874
Rose! You're not dead!

1367
01:57:09.076 --> 01:57:10.170
Where's my droid?

1368
01:57:11.556 --> 01:57:12.591
Buddy!

1369
01:57:12.756 --> 01:57:14.870
I'm so glad to see you!

1370
01:57:16.676 --> 01:57:18.826
Wait, what?
Wait, wait, wait, slow down.

1371
01:57:18.996 --> 01:57:20.270
Is this all that's left?

1372
01:57:30.636 --> 01:57:32.917
Alright, shields are up
so they can't hit us from orbit.

1373
01:57:33.156 --> 01:57:34.476
Use whatever power we've got left

1374
01:57:34.556 --> 01:57:36.592
to broadcast a distress signal
to the Outer Rim.

1375
01:57:36.756 --> 01:57:38.428
Use my personal code.

1376
01:57:38.916 --> 01:57:41.749
If there are any allies to the Resistance,

1377
01:57:42.316 --> 01:57:43.431
it's now or never.

1378
01:57:44.156 --> 01:57:46.067
Rose, what do you got?

1379
01:57:46.556 --> 01:57:50.051
Rotting munitions, rusted artillery,
some half-gutted skim speeders.

1380
01:57:50.316 --> 01:57:51.316
Well,

1381
01:57:52.316 --> 01:57:53.749
let's just pray that big-ass door

1382
01:57:53.876 --> 01:57:55.851
holds long enough for us to get help.

1383
01:58:06.436 --> 01:58:08.233
A battering ram cannon.

1384
01:58:08.396 --> 01:58:09.534
A what now?

1385
01:58:10.476 --> 01:58:11.875
Miniaturized Death Star tech.

1386
01:58:12.536 --> 01:58:14.288
It'll crack that door open like an egg.

1387
01:58:14.556 --> 01:58:16.356
There has to be a back way
out of here, right?

1388
01:58:17.516 --> 01:58:19.213
BB-8, what do you got?

1389
01:58:20.116 --> 01:58:23.313
BB-8 has analyzed
the mine's schematics.

1390
01:58:23.476 --> 01:58:26.593
This is the only way in or out.

1391
01:58:33.956 --> 01:58:34.956
Come on.

1392
01:58:35.956 --> 01:58:37.184
We have allies.

1393
01:58:37.436 --> 01:58:39.167
People believe in Leia.

1394
01:58:39.956 --> 01:58:41.714
They'll get our message,
they'll come.

1395
01:58:42.076 --> 01:58:43.906
But we have to buy time.

1396
01:58:45.276 --> 01:58:47.249
We gotta take out that cannon.

1397
01:58:52.236 --> 01:58:53.236
On me! On me!

1398
01:58:54.436 --> 01:58:55.436
Move! Move!

1399
01:58:55.756 --> 01:58:57.109
Go back! Gather your weapons!

1400
01:58:57.276 --> 01:58:58.709
Get over here!

1401
01:58:58.876 --> 01:58:59.916
Hold your fire!

1402
01:59:17.156 --> 01:59:18.156
Salt.

1403
01:59:18.416 --> 01:59:19.916
Ground forces, incoming.

1404
01:59:20.056 --> 01:59:21.528
<i>Copy that. On our way.</i>

1405
01:59:38.836 --> 01:59:39.985
Engage your mono-ski.

1406
01:59:40.156 --> 01:59:41.214
The green toggle.

1407
01:59:51.756 --> 01:59:52.905
Alright, listen up.

1408
01:59:53.416 --> 01:59:56.533
I don't like these rust buckets
and I don't like our odds, but...

1409
01:59:56.716 --> 01:59:58.035
What the hell?

1410
01:59:58.196 --> 01:59:59.470
Just keep it tight

1411
01:59:59.636 --> 02:00:02.694
and don't get drawn in too close
till they roll that cannon out front.

1412
02:00:22.676 --> 02:00:25.006
Alright, ground forces,
lay down some fire!

1413
02:00:37.956 --> 02:00:39.833
Thirteen incoming light craft.

1414
02:00:39.996 --> 02:00:41.907
Shall we hold until we clear them?

1415
02:00:41.916 --> 02:00:44.394
No. The Resistance
is in that mine.

1416
02:00:45.316 --> 02:00:46.465
Push through.

1417
02:00:51.316 --> 02:00:52.829
Fighters, break off!

1418
02:01:03.216 --> 02:01:06.094
Come on! We gotta hold them
till they pull up that cannon!

1419
02:01:21.236 --> 02:01:23.272
<i>Rose, you got three right behind you!</i>

1420
02:01:31.156 --> 02:01:32.156
I can't lose them!

1421
02:01:40.376 --> 02:01:41.376
Yeah!

1422
02:01:54.896 --> 02:01:55.952
I like this!

1423
02:02:04.556 --> 02:02:07.628
Blow that piece of junk out of the sky!

1424
02:02:07.836 --> 02:02:09.189
All fighters!

1425
02:02:16.356 --> 02:02:18.028
Chewie, peel off from the battle.

1426
02:02:18.196 --> 02:02:19.549
Draw them away from the speeders.

1427
02:02:25.356 --> 02:02:26.994
She drew them off! All of them!

1428
02:02:27.256 --> 02:02:28.848
Oh, they hate that ship!

1429
02:02:41.356 --> 02:02:42.356
Chewie!

1430
02:03:13.716 --> 02:03:14.716
There it is!

1431
02:03:19.916 --> 02:03:21.031
That is a big gun.

1432
02:03:21.196 --> 02:03:22.516
<i>Ok, it's heavily armored.</i>

1433
02:03:22.636 --> 02:03:24.527
Our only shot is right down the throat.

1434
02:03:32.436 --> 02:03:34.188
The cannon's opening.
This is our chance.

1435
02:03:34.356 --> 02:03:35.636
All firepower on those speeders.

1436
02:03:35.716 --> 02:03:37.550
Concentrate all fire on the speeders!

1437
02:03:45.036 --> 02:03:46.369
We're taking heavy losses.

1438
02:03:58.876 --> 02:04:00.892
They're picking us all off.
We're not gonna make it.

1439
02:04:00.916 --> 02:04:02.634
<i>Alright, making my final approach.</i>

1440
02:04:02.796 --> 02:04:04.195
<i>Target in sight, guns are hot.</i>

1441
02:04:04.356 --> 02:04:05.584
No! Pull off!

1442
02:04:05.756 --> 02:04:06.591
What?

1443
02:04:06.592 --> 02:04:08.532
The cannon is charged!
It's a suicide run!

1444
02:04:08.956 --> 02:04:10.009
<i>All craft, pull away!</i>

1445
02:04:10.076 --> 02:04:12.246
No! I'm almost there!
<i>Retreat, Finn!</i>

1446
02:04:12.316 --> 02:04:13.444
That's an order!

1447
02:04:22.556 --> 02:04:24.706
Finn? It's too late! Don't do this!

1448
02:04:24.876 --> 02:04:26.867
No! I won't let them win!

1449
02:04:28.916 --> 02:04:30.872
<i>No! Finn, listen to Poe!</i>

1450
02:04:31.136 --> 02:04:32.169
<i>We have to retreat!</i>

1451
02:04:44.516 --> 02:04:46.950
<i>The cannon is warming up now.</i>

1452
02:04:47.116 --> 02:04:48.452
<i>Copy that. We see it.</i>

1453
02:04:48.476 --> 02:04:49.628
<i>Preparing to fire.</i>

1454
02:05:32.036 --> 02:05:33.867
Move! Go, go! Quick!

1455
02:05:34.036 --> 02:05:35.408
Let's go, let's go!

1456
02:05:42.116 --> 02:05:43.116
Rose?

1457
02:05:48.956 --> 02:05:50.071
Rose?

1458
02:05:50.476 --> 02:05:51.476
Rose?

1459
02:05:52.796 --> 02:05:54.027
Why would you do that?

1460
02:05:54.716 --> 02:05:56.093
I was almost there.

1461
02:05:57.396 --> 02:05:58.875
Why would you stop me?

1462
02:05:59.636 --> 02:06:01.352
I saved you,

1463
02:06:02.796 --> 02:06:03.796
dummy.

1464
02:06:04.916 --> 02:06:06.488
That's how we're gonna win.

1465
02:06:06.756 --> 02:06:08.545
Not fighting what we hate,

1466
02:06:09.596 --> 02:06:11.251
saving what we love.

1467
02:06:31.396 --> 02:06:32.749
General Hux,

1468
02:06:32.916 --> 02:06:34.074
advance.

1469
02:06:34.816 --> 02:06:36.008
No quarter.

1470
02:06:37.916 --> 02:06:39.174
No prisoners.

1471
02:06:41.236 --> 02:06:43.967
Our distress signal's been
received at multiple points,

1472
02:06:44.636 --> 02:06:46.106
but no response.

1473
02:06:47.276 --> 02:06:48.628
They've heard us,

1474
02:06:49.396 --> 02:06:50.912
but no one's coming.

1475
02:06:55.876 --> 02:06:57.626
We fought till the end.

1476
02:07:00.356 --> 02:07:05.005
But the galaxy has lost all its hope.

1477
02:07:06.676 --> 02:07:07.709
The spark...

1478
02:07:10.036 --> 02:07:11.515
is out.

1479
02:07:37.116 --> 02:07:38.274
Luke.

1480
02:07:47.116 --> 02:07:49.010
I know what you're gonna say.

1481
02:07:50.916 --> 02:07:52.647
I changed my hair.

1482
02:07:54.756 --> 02:07:56.228
It's nice that way.

1483
02:07:58.276 --> 02:07:59.414
Leia,

1484
02:08:01.076 --> 02:08:02.076
I'm sorry.

1485
02:08:02.276 --> 02:08:03.307
I know.

1486
02:08:04.316 --> 02:08:05.711
I know you are.

1487
02:08:07.316 --> 02:08:09.172
I'm just glad you're here...

1488
02:08:10.196 --> 02:08:11.254
at the end.

1489
02:08:13.156 --> 02:08:14.987
I came to face him, Leia.

1490
02:08:16.996 --> 02:08:18.526
And I can't save him.

1491
02:08:19.596 --> 02:08:22.172
I held out hope for so long,

1492
02:08:25.636 --> 02:08:27.696
but I know my son is gone.

1493
02:08:29.076 --> 02:08:30.795
No one's ever really gone.

1494
02:09:07.496 --> 02:09:08.727
Master Luke.

1495
02:09:32.276 --> 02:09:33.276
Stop!

1496
02:09:58.916 --> 02:10:02.631
I want every gun we have
to fire on that man.

1497
02:10:07.596 --> 02:10:08.596
Do it.

1498
02:10:25.716 --> 02:10:26.831
More!

1499
02:10:30.116 --> 02:10:31.116
More!

1500
02:10:45.676 --> 02:10:47.014
That's enough.

1501
02:10:48.756 --> 02:10:50.151
That's enough!

1502
02:10:56.876 --> 02:10:58.314
Do you think you got him?

1503
02:10:59.836 --> 02:11:01.667
Now, if we're ready to get moving,

1504
02:11:01.836 --> 02:11:03.431
we can finish this.

1505
02:11:04.196 --> 02:11:05.196
Sir?

1506
02:11:31.796 --> 02:11:33.115
Bring me down to him.

1507
02:11:33.476 --> 02:11:36.209
Keep the door covered
and don't advance until I say.

1508
02:11:36.396 --> 02:11:37.396
Supreme Leader,

1509
02:11:37.836 --> 02:11:39.349
don't get distracted, our goal...

1510
02:11:41.836 --> 02:11:43.064
Right away, sir.

1511
02:11:44.196 --> 02:11:45.409
Med pack!

1512
02:11:45.916 --> 02:11:47.152
I need a med pack!

1513
02:11:48.156 --> 02:11:49.592
She's hurt pretty bad.

1514
02:12:08.956 --> 02:12:10.030
It's Kylo Ren.

1515
02:12:10.436 --> 02:12:11.630
Luke's facing him alone.

1516
02:12:11.796 --> 02:12:12.768
Well, we should help him.

1517
02:12:12.769 --> 02:12:14.728
Let's go.
No, wait. Wait.

1518
02:12:28.696 --> 02:12:30.651
Did you come back
to say you forgive me?

1519
02:12:32.356 --> 02:12:34.033
To save my soul?

1520
02:12:35.996 --> 02:12:36.996
No.

1521
02:12:56.476 --> 02:12:58.006
He's doing this for a reason.

1522
02:13:00.556 --> 02:13:02.308
He's stalling so we can escape.

1523
02:13:02.396 --> 02:13:04.612
Escape? He's one man
against an army.

1524
02:13:04.636 --> 02:13:06.149
We have to help him,
we have to fight.

1525
02:13:06.150 --> 02:13:08.511
No, no, no. We are the spark
that'll light the fire

1526
02:13:08.596 --> 02:13:10.188
that'll burn the First Order down.

1527
02:13:11.316 --> 02:13:13.888
Skywalker's doing this
so we can survive.

1528
02:13:14.556 --> 02:13:16.115
There's gotta be a way
out of this mine.

1529
02:13:16.116 --> 02:13:17.276
Hell, how did he get in here?

1530
02:13:17.436 --> 02:13:21.475
Sir, it is possible that
a natural unmapped opening exists.

1531
02:13:21.776 --> 02:13:24.734
But this facility is such
a maze of endless tunnels

1532
02:13:24.896 --> 02:13:26.973
that the odds of finding an exit are...

1533
02:13:27.374 --> 02:13:29.469
15,428...
Hush. Shush up.

1534
02:13:29.470 --> 02:13:30.470
Shut up!

1535
02:13:32.116 --> 02:13:33.134
To one.
Listen.

1536
02:13:36.516 --> 02:13:38.746
My audio sensors
no longer detect the...

1537
02:13:38.916 --> 02:13:39.916
Exactly.

1538
02:13:45.876 --> 02:13:47.595
Where'd the crystal critters go?

1539
02:13:54.276 --> 02:13:55.276
Follow me.

1540
02:13:59.836 --> 02:14:01.492
What are you looking at me for?

1541
02:14:01.856 --> 02:14:02.935
Follow him.

1542
02:14:15.076 --> 02:14:17.544
If the beacon's right beneath us,
they've got to be somewhere.

1543
02:14:17.816 --> 02:14:19.129
Keep scanning for life forms.

1544
02:14:29.036 --> 02:14:30.049
This way.

1545
02:14:35.116 --> 02:14:36.754
I see them! Chewie, there!

1546
02:14:50.436 --> 02:14:53.114
No. No, no, no.

1547
02:14:56.716 --> 02:14:57.716
No!

1548
02:15:09.956 --> 02:15:11.187
Lifting rocks.

1549
02:15:51.876 --> 02:15:53.990
I failed you, Ben.

1550
02:15:55.236 --> 02:15:57.491
I'm sorry.
I'm sure you are!

1551
02:15:58.756 --> 02:16:00.626
The Resistance is dead.

1552
02:16:00.996 --> 02:16:02.254
The war is over.

1553
02:16:02.756 --> 02:16:04.347
And when I kill you,

1554
02:16:04.916 --> 02:16:07.150
I will have killed the last Jedi.

1555
02:16:07.516 --> 02:16:08.631
Amazing.

1556
02:16:09.196 --> 02:16:11.635
Every word of what you just said...

1557
02:16:12.036 --> 02:16:13.050
was wrong.

1558
02:16:15.316 --> 02:16:18.033
The Rebellion is reborn today.

1559
02:16:20.636 --> 02:16:22.027
The war...

1560
02:16:22.296 --> 02:16:23.768
is just beginning.

1561
02:16:25.676 --> 02:16:29.355
And I will not be the last Jedi.

1562
02:17:09.356 --> 02:17:10.892
I'll destroy her,

1563
02:17:11.556 --> 02:17:12.692
and you,

1564
02:17:13.756 --> 02:17:14.894
and all of it.

1565
02:17:19.236 --> 02:17:20.136
No.

1566
02:17:21.356 --> 02:17:24.787
Strike me down in anger
and I'll always be with you.

1567
02:17:27.236 --> 02:17:29.006
Just like your father.

1568
02:18:18.756 --> 02:18:19.756
No.

1569
02:18:24.076 --> 02:18:25.892
See you around, kid.

1570
02:18:39.876 --> 02:18:41.275
No!

1571
02:21:18.716 --> 02:21:20.752
C'ai!

1572
02:21:20.836 --> 02:21:22.092
Such a friend.

1573
02:21:23.156 --> 02:21:24.174
Chewie!

1574
02:21:26.096 --> 02:21:27.096
It looks good.

1575
02:21:28.396 --> 02:21:29.545
That was crazy, man.

1576
02:21:30.996 --> 02:21:32.475
Hi.
Hi.

1577
02:21:33.076 --> 02:21:34.111
I'm Poe.

1578
02:21:34.956 --> 02:21:35.956
Rey.

1579
02:21:36.316 --> 02:21:37.351
I know.

1580
02:21:49.676 --> 02:21:51.732
When we get to the Outer Rim,
I have a contact there.

1581
02:21:51.756 --> 02:21:53.076
Quite definitely possible.

1582
02:22:03.476 --> 02:22:04.555
Luke is gone.

1583
02:22:05.736 --> 02:22:06.935
I felt it.

1584
02:22:07.836 --> 02:22:09.667
But it wasn't sadness or pain
It was...

1585
02:22:10.956 --> 02:22:12.965
peace and purpose.

1586
02:22:14.236 --> 02:22:15.355
I felt it, too.

1587
02:22:18.236 --> 02:22:20.448
How do we build a Rebellion from this?

1588
02:22:25.596 --> 02:22:27.315
We have everything we need.

1589
02:22:47.956 --> 02:22:49.453
Luke Skywalker,

1590
02:22:49.916 --> 02:22:51.413
Jedi Master.
