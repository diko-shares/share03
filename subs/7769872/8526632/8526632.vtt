It's an A-class process,
they'll control it from the main bridge.

573

Well, I mean, yes,
but every A-class process...

Just give it to me
one more time, simpler.

581
00:41:55.846 --> 00:41:59.141
So, the First Order's only tracking us
from one Destroyer, the lead one.

582
00:41:59.308 --> 00:42:00.393
So we blow that one up?

584
00:42:01.936 --> 00:42:03.646
