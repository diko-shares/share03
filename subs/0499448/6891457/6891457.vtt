From my chess set.
- which chess set?

I didn't exactly have
a solid gold chess set
in finchley, did I?

- don't you see?
- what?

112
00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:24.880
Imagine walls.

113
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.520
And columns, there.

114
00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:36.520

Then what is it?

We're not exactly sure.

121
00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.600
Impossible.

122
00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:52.320
I warned this council when it
put its trust in lord miraz...

123
00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.920
- ...there would
be consequences.
- no.

124
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.920
We can't accuse the
lord protector without proof.

125
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.040
How long are we going
to hide behind that excuse?

Until every chair
in this chamber is empty?

Ever since the death
of caspian the ninth,

you've behaved
as if you were king.

133

Now it seems that from
behind his walls even prince

Thank you, lord sopespian.

I trust you can tell
us how such
a tragedy could have occurred.

142

That is the most
disturbing news of all.

blatant crime on fairy tales?

- what?
- [Men Talking, indistinct]

149
00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:43.680
We forget, my lords...
Narnia was once a savage land.

150
00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:46.800
Fierce creatures roamed free.

151
00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:50.720
Much of our
forefathers' blood was shed

152
00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:54.760
to exterminate this vermin.

153
00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:01.640
Or so we thought.

154
00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:06.720
But while we've been bickering
amongst ourselves...

...They've been breeding
like cockroaches under a rock!

why we don't like you.

Well, I intend to strike back.

160

Even if I have to cut down
the entire forest...

161
00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:44.280
...I assure you,
I will find prince caspian

162
00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:49.080
and finish what
our ancestors began.

163
00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:10.200
- catapults.
- what?

164
00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:16.120
This didn't just happen.
Cair paravel was attacked.

[Crackling]

166
00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:04.360
Don't suppose you have
any matches, do you?

167
00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:07.680
No, but...

168
00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:09.840
...Would this help?

169
00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:12.960
You might have mentioned
that a bit sooner.

170
00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:57.920
I can't believe it.
It's all still here.

171
00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:13.760
[Lucy] I was so tall.

172
00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:16.720
Well, you
were older then.

173
00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:20.920
As opposed to
hundreds of years
later... When you're younger.

174
00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:36.960
- [Lucy] What is it?
- my horn.

175
00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:40.880
I must've left it on my saddle
the day we went back.

176

When aslan bares his teeth,
winter meets its death.

177
00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:09.480
When he shakes his mane...

178

...We shall have spring again.

179
00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:22.320
Everyone we knew...
Mr. Tumnus and the beavers...

180
00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:26.320
...They're all gone.

181
00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:36.000
I think it's time we
found out what's going on.

182
00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.720
He won't stop staring.

183
00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.320
So don't look.

184
00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:08.320
Here's far enough.

185
00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:18.720
Drop him!

186
00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:21.280
Crows and crockery!

187
00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.040
[Grunting]

188
00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.880
[Gagging]

189
00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:05.760
"Drop him"!

190
00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:10.400
That's the best
you can come up with?

191
00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.760
A simple "thank you"
Would suffice.

192
00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:15.760
They were doing fine
drowning me without your help.

193
00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.760
Maybe we should have let them.

194
00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.880
Why were they trying
to kill you, anyway?

195
00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:24.960
They're telmarines.
That's what they do.

196
00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:28.360
Telmarines? In narnia?

197
00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:32.680
Where have you been
for the last few
hundred years?

198
00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:34.400
It's a bit of a long story.

199
00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:46.920
Oh, you've got
to be kidding me.

200
00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:49.920
You're it?

201
00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:53.080
You're the kings
and queens of old?

202
00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:56.800
High king peter,
the magnificent.

203
00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:00.800
You probably could've
left off the last bit.

204
00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:04.360
[Laughing] Probably.

205
00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.840
You might be surprised.

206
00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:11.320
Oh, you don't want
to do that, boy.

207
00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.880
Not me. Him.

208
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.040
- [Grunts]
- [Lucy] Edmund!

209
00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:35.000
You all right? Oh!

210
00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:36.840
[Lucy Laughing]

211
00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.000
[Growls] Huh!

212
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.720
Beards and bedsteads!

213
00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:00.000
Maybe that horn
worked after all.

214
00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:02.040
What horn?

215
00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:24.400
[Male] This bread is so stale.

216
00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:27.880
[Male 2] I'll just give
him some soup. He should
be coming around soon.

217
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.840
[Male] I don't think
I hit him hard enough.

218
00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:32.080
[Male 2] nikabrik,
he's just a boy.

219
00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:34.920
He's a telmarine,
not some lost puppy.

220
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.320
You said you
were gonna get rid of him.

221
00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:39.920
No. I said
I'd take care of him.

222
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.360
We can't kill him now.
I just bandaged his head.

223
00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:46.400
It would be like
murdering a guest.

224
00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:48.920
How do you think his friends
are treating their guest?

225
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.920
Trumpkin knew
what he was doing.
It's not the boy's fault.

226
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.880
Ah!

227
00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.200
Stop! Stop!

228
00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.960
Hold it. No, no!

229
00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:04.400
I told you we should
have killed him
when we had the chance.

230
00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:05.920
You know why we can't.

231
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.480
If we're taking a vote,
I'm with him.

232
00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:09.920
We can't let him go.
He's seen us.

233
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.440
Enough, nikabrik!

234
00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:14.040
Or do I have to sit
on your head again?

235
00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:19.280
And you. Look what
you made me do.

236
00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.840
I spent half the morning
on that soup.

237
00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:24.800
What are you?

238
00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:27.960
You know, it's funny
that you would ask that.

239
00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.360
You think people would
know a badger
when they saw one.

240
00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.440
No. No, I mean...

241
00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:37.000
...You're narnians.
You're supposed to be extinct.

242
00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:39.480
Sorry to disappoint you.

243
00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:45.920
Here you go. Still hot.

244
00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:49.400
Since when did we open
a boarding house
for telmarine soldiers?

245
00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:55.920
I'm not a soldier.
I am prince
caspian. The tenth.

246
00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:58.960
What are you doing here?

247
00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:02.520
Running away.

248
00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:09.480
My uncle has always
wanted my throne.

249
00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:14.680
I suppose I have
only lived this long

250
00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:17.520
because he did not
have an heir of his own.

251
00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:24.360
- oh... That changes things.
- yeah.

252
00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:26.680
Means we don't have
to kill you ourselves.

253
00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:29.360
You're right.

254
00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:34.000
- where are you going?
- my uncle won't stop
until I am dead.

255
00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:38.320
But... You can't leave.
You're meant to save us.

256
00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:41.880
Don't you know what this is?

257
00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:57.320
[Rattling]

258
00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:11.560
You have quite
a library, Doctor.

259
00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:18.080
Is there anything
particular you seek, my lord?

260
00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:22.080
I think I've already found
what I'm looking for...

261
00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:27.040
...In one of my soldiers!

262
00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:49.400
What do you know
of queen susan's horn?

263
00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:51.960
It was said to be magic.

264
00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:53.920
Magic?

265
00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:55.480
The narnians believed

266
00:30:55.560 --> 00:31:00.320
it could summon their kings
and queens of old.

267
00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:05.280
At least,
such was the superstition.

268
00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:11.680
And what does caspian
know of this superstition?

269
00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:17.280
My lord, you forbade me
from mentioning the old tales.

270
00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:21.360
So I did.

271
00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:32.760
I will say this. If caspian
does know of the deep magic...

272
00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:36.480
...My lord would
have good reason
to be nervous.

273
00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:53.320
First our prince...

274
00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:55.280
...Now his tutor.

275
00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:58.680
If the members of miraz's
own house are not safe,

276
00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:02.040
- are any of us?
- [Man] Lord sopespian!

277
00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:04.840
Those are dangerous words,
lord sopespian.

278
00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:07.720
But these are
dangerous times, general.

279
00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:13.360
One should choose his words
as carefully as he chooses
his friends.

280
00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:20.120
How long until
the bridge is finished?

281
00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:23.800
- construction continues
on schedule.
- that's not good enough.

282
00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:26.400
I need my army
across that river now.

283
00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:29.360
May I suggest you contribute
some of your own men?

284
00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:31.800
I've only so many
at my disposal.

285
00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:35.800
A fact you'd
be wise to remember.

286
00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:39.200
Go to beruna.

287
00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:41.200
Take as many
troops as you need.

288
00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:43.880
We must get to caspian
before they do.

289
00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:46.160
"They," my lord?

290
00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:50.240
It's time you
learned your history.

291
00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:21.760
They're so still.

292
00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:27.240
They're trees.
What'd you expect?

293
00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:30.160
They used to dance.

294
00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:36.240
Wasn't long after you left
that the telmarines invaded.

295
00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:41.200
Those who survived retreated
to the woods. And the trees,

296
00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:46.200
they retreated so deep
into themselves that they
haven't been heard from since.

297
00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:50.160
I don't understand. How could
aslan have let this happen?

298
00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:55.240
Aslan? Thought he abandoned
us when you lot did.

299
00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:02.280
We didn't mean to leave,
you know.

300
00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:05.840
Makes no difference now,
does it?

301
00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:10.800
Get us to the narnians...
And it will.

302
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.760
Hello, there.

303
00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:54.200
[Grunting]

304
00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:58.080
It's all right. We're friends.

305
00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:01.280
[Grunts]

306
00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:09.040
- don't move, your majesty.
- [Growling]

307
00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:14.160
Stay away from her!

308
00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:22.160
- shoot, susan! Shoot!
- [Lucy Screaming]

309
00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:37.800
- why wouldn't he stop?
- I suspect he was hungry.

310
00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:53.760
Thanks.

311
00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:58.560
He was wild.

312
00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:02.040
I don't think he
could talk at all.

313
00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:06.040
Get treated like
a dumb animal long enough,

314
00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:10.080
that's what you become.

315
00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:14.960
You may find narnia a more
savage place
than you remember.

316
00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:17.200
- [Blade Cuts]
- [Sobbing]

317
00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:34.040
- [Rustling]
- I can hear you.

318
00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:40.000
I just think we should wait
for the kings and queens.

319
00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:44.640
Fine! Go then!
See if the others
will be as understanding!

320
00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:49.120
Or maybe I'll come with you.
I want to see you explain
things to the minotaurs.

321
00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:52.000
Minotaurs?

322
00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:54.160
They're real?

323
00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:55.720
And very bad-tempered.

324
00:36:55.800 --> 00:37:00.120
- yeah, not to mention big.
- huge.

325
00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:03.600
What about centaurs?
Do they still exist?

326
00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:06.640
Well, the centaurs will
probably fight on your side.

327
00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:10.000
But there's no telling
what the others will do.

328
00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:13.240
What about aslan?

329
00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:21.040
How do you know
so much about us?

330
00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:23.680
- stories.
- wait a minute.

331
00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:26.960
Your father told you
stories about narnia?

332
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.280
No, my professor, he...

333
00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:34.680
Listen, I'm sorry.
These are not
the kind of questions

334
00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:37.040
you should be asking.

335
00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:41.000
- what is it?
- human.

336
00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:43.760
- him?
- no. Them.

337
00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:47.000
[Men Shouting]

338
00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:49.800
- there they are!
- run!

339
00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:54.680
[Shouting]

340
00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:03.760
Now!

341
00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:11.840
Oh! Ah!

342
00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:15.280
- oh, no.
- wait. I'll go.

343
00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:24.040
Take it. Go! It's more
important than I am.

344
00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:30.240
[Grunts]

345
00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:34.240
Whoa! Uh!

346
00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:43.840
Oh!

347
00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:52.000
- [Panting]
- [Squeaking]

348
00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:59.080
Get him out of here.

349
00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:04.760
Ah!

350
00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.000
Where are you?

351
00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:14.800
Ah!

352
00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:26.200
Ah! Hyah!

353
00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:30.760
Choose your last words
carefully, telmarine.

354
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.680
You are a mouse.

355
00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:37.760
[Sighs] I was
hoping for something
a little more original.

356
00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:40.120
Pick up your sword.

357
00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:43.800
Uh... No, thanks.

358
00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:47.160
Pick it up! I will not
fight an unarmed man.

359
00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:49.320
Which is why
I might live longer

360
00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:52.160
if I choose not
to cross blades
with you, noble mouse.

361
00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:56.080
I said I would not fight you.
I didn't say I'd let you live!

362
00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.240
Reepicheep!

363
00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:00.040
- stay your blade!
- trufflehunter?

364
00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:04.000
I trust you have a very
good reason for this
untimely interruption.

365
00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:08.240
- he doesn't. Go ahead.
- he's the one
who blew the horn.

366
00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:13.160
- what?
- then let him
bring it forward.

367
00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:19.840
This is the reason
we have gathered.

368
00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:26.240
[Susan] I don't
remember this way.

369
00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:27.760
That's the problem with girls.

370
00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:29.200
You can't carry a map
in your heads.

371
00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:31.520
That's because our heads
have something in them.

372
00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:36.080
I wish he'd just listen
to the DL.F.
In the first place.

373
00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:40.960
- DL.F.?
- dear little friend.

374
00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:44.280
Oh, that's not at all
patronizing, is it?

375
00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:49.200
I'm not lost.

376
00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:52.080
No.

377
00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:55.080
You're just going
the wrong way.

378
00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:57.080
You last saw caspian
at the shuddering woods,

379
00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:59.960
and the quickest way there
is to cross at the river rush.

380
00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:03.560
But unless I'm
mistaken, there's
no crossing in these parts.

381
00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:07.080
That explains it, then.
You're mistaken.

382
00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:33.560
You see, over time,
water erodes the earth's soil,
carving deeper...

383
00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:35.160
Oh, shut up.

384
00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:38.560
- is there a way down?
- yeah, falling.

385
00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:41.520
Well, we weren't lost.

386
00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:44.560
There's a ford near beruna.
How do you feel
about swimming?

387
00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:47.160
I'd rather that than walking.

388
00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:50.080
Aslan?

389
00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:53.080
It's aslan!
It's aslan over there!

390
00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:55.760
Don't you see? He's right...

391
00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:01.600
...There.

392
00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:04.280
Do you see him now?

393
00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:07.120
I'm not crazy.

394
00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:10.160
He was there.
He wanted us to follow him.

395
00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:15.680
I'm sure there are any number
of lions in this wood.

396
00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:19.040
- just like that bear.
- I think I know aslan
when I see him.

397
00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:23.080
Look, I'm not about
to jump off a cliff

398
00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:25.160
after someone
who doesn't exist.

399
00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:27.280
The last time
I didn't believe lucy

400
00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:30.560
I ended up looking
pretty stupid.

401
00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:38.080
Why wouldn't I have seen him?

402
00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:40.640
Maybe you weren't looking.

403
00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:44.000
I'm sorry, lu.

404
00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:10.120
[Shouting]

405
00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:11.680
Kill him!

406
00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:14.600
- telmarine!
- liar!

407
00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:16.080
Murderer!

408
00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:18.000
All this horn proves
is they've stolen

409
00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:19.520
yet another thing from us!

410
00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:20.520
I didn't steal anything.

411
00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:22.280
Didn't steal anything?

412
00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:23.560
Shall we list the things

413
00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:25.040
the telmarines have taken?

414
00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:26.680
- our homes!
- our land!

415
00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:29.200
- our freedom!
- our lives!

416
00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:30.520
You stole narnia!

417
00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:32.240
You would hold me accountable

418
00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:33.680
for all the crimes
of my people?

419
00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:35.600
Accountable...

420
00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:38.320
...And punishable.

421
00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:41.920
Ha! That is rich coming
from you, dwarf.

422
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.880
Have you forgotten it was
your people who fought
alongside the white witch?

423
00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:49.880
And I'd gladly do it again,
if it would rid us
of these barbarians.

424
00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:53.280
Then it's lucky that it is not
in your power to
bring her back.

425
00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:57.840
Or are you suggesting
that we ask this boy
to go against aslan now?

426
00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:01.200
- [Roaring]
- [Shouting]

427
00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:04.760
Some of you may
have forgotten, but
we badgers remember well...

428
00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:09.800
...That narnia was never right
except when a son of adam
was king.

429
00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:12.400
He's a telmarine! Why would
we want him as our king?

430
00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:14.720
- [Shouting]
- because I can help you.

431
00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:17.320
- it's a trick!
- at least hear him out!

432
00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:21.200
Beyond these woods,
I'm a prince.

433
00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:24.800
The telmarine throne
is rightfully mine!

434
00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:29.400
Help me claim it, and I
can bring peace between us.

435
00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:34.840
It is true. The time is ripe.

436
00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:37.880
I watch the skies...

437
00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:44.320
...For it is mine
to watch as it
is yours to remember, badger.

438
00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:49.280
Tarva, the lord of victory,
and alambil,
the lady of peace,

439
00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:53.760
have come together
in the high heavens.

440
00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:58.200
And now here, a son of adam
has come forth...

441
00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:02.280
...To offer us
back our freedom.

442
00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:05.760
Is this possible?
Do you really
think there could be peace?

443
00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:08.280
Do you? I mean, really?

444
00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:13.360
Two days ago, I didn't
believe in the existence
of talking animals...

445
00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:16.480
...Or dwarves... Or centaurs.

446
00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:20.840
Yet here you are
in strength and numbers

447
00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:24.320
that we telmarines
could never have imagined.

448
00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:29.760
Whether this horn is magic
or not, it brought
us together.

449
00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:32.240
And together,

450
00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:36.320
we have a chance
to take back what is ours.

451
00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:42.160
If you will lead us,
then my sons and I...

452
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.920
...Offer you our swords.

453
00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:59.640
And we offer you our lives,
unreservedly.

454
00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:04.840
Miraz's army will not
be far behind us, sire.

455
00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:10.280
If we are to be ready for
them, we need to hurry to find
soldiers and weapons.

456
00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:16.440
I'm sure they
will be here soon.

457
00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:31.240
[Man] These ones!
And these ones!

458
00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:35.360
[Man 2] timber!

459
00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:39.440
- [Man 3] get back!
- watch your back!

460
00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:42.880
[Man 4] look out!

461
00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:45.920
- steady, steady!
- timber!

[Men Shouting]

463
00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:06.400
Perhaps this
wasn't the best way
to come after all.

464
00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:37.720
[Peter] So where exactly
do you think you saw aslan?

465
00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:43.240
I wish you'd all stop trying
to sound like grown-ups.

466
00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:47.160
I don't think I saw him,
I did see him.

467
00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:50.160
I am a grown-up.

468
00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:52.280
It was right over...

- lucy!

470
00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:01.440

Lucy, are you awake?

472
00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:54.720
Hmm...

473
00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:01.280
Why do you think
I didn't see aslan?

474
00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:08.200
You believe me?

475
00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:11.360
Well, we got across the gorge.

476
00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:16.240
I don't know.

477
00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:20.480
Maybe you didn't
really want to.

478
00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:27.120
You always knew we'd be
coming back here, didn't you?

479
00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:29.520
I hoped so.

480
00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:38.240
I finally just got used
to the idea of
being in england.

481
00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:41.200
But you're happy
to be here, aren't you?

482
00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:45.200

Well, yes, but...
I thought you'd be older.

- if you like, we could
come back in a few years...
- no.

No, that's all right.

- well, at least we know some
of you can handle a blade.

522
00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:51.240
Yes, indeed. And I have
recently put it to good use,

523
00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:53.440
securing weapons
for your army, sire.

524
00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:57.720
Good. Because we're going
to need every
sword we can get.

525
00:55:57.760 --> 00:56:01.440
Well, then you will probably
be wanting yours back.

526
00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:23.800
How much did they take?

527
00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:26.480
Enough weapons and armor
for two regiments.

528
00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:30.160
But... There's more.

529
00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:36.200
"You were right
to fear the woods."

530
00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:40.840
- "x"?
- caspian. The tenth.

531
00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:44.720
I apologize, my lord.
The blame is mine.

532
00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:47.160
I know.

533
00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:49.840
Tell me, general...

534
00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:52.880
...How many men did you lose?

535
00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:56.760
- none, my lord.
- none?

536
00:56:56.840 --> 00:57:02.240
They came like ghosts,
in the dead of night.
We never saw them.

537
00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:06.840
Then how do you
explain your injuries?

538
00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:17.840
I asked...

539
00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:20.200
...How many men were killed

540
00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:24.320
during this bloody
narnian attack?

541
00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:30.200
Of which you were
a fortunate survivor.

542
00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:34.760
General...

543
00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:37.320
...How many?

544
00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:53.920
Three.

545
00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:04.720
I apologize, lord sopespian.

546
00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:10.800
Caspian is not a victim
of this savage uprising.

547
00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:12.560
He is the instigator.

548
00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:20.920
It seems narnia
is in need of a new king.

549
00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:32.160
[Peter] Well, it's good
you have troops,

550
00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:36.280
but we need
some fortifications.
Somewhere to train.

551
00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:43.160
So? What are they like?

552
00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:47.760
Malcontents, complainers,
stubborn as mules
in the morning.

553
00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:50.800
Oh. So you like them, then.

554
00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:53.800
Well enough.

555
01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:16.720
It may not be what you are
used to, but it is defensible.

556
01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:19.880
Peter. You may
want to see this.

557
01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:37.360
It's us.

558
01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:41.840
What is this place?

559
01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:44.880
You don't know?

560
01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:23.400
He must know what he's doing.

561
01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:32.480
I think it's up to us now.

562
01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:08.200
[Peter] It's only
a matter of time.

563
01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:11.520
Miraz's men and war machines
are on their way.

564
01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:15.360
That means those same men
aren't protecting his castle.

565
01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:17.760
What do you propose we do,
your majesty?

566
01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:21.080
- we need to get ready for it.
- to start planning for...

567
01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:28.240
Our only hope
is to strike them
before they strike us.

568
01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:32.400
- crazy. No one
has taken that castle.
- there's always a first time.

569
01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:36.240
- we'll have
the element of surprise.
- we have the advantage here!

570
01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:40.240
If we dig in, we
could probably
hold them off indefinitely.

571
01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:44.360
[Trufflehunter] I, for one,
feel safer underground.

572
01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:47.440
Look. I appreciate
what you've done here,

573
01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:51.240
but this isn't a fortress.
It's a tomb.

574
01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:53.200
Yes. And if they're smart,

575
01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:55.720
the telmarines will just wait
and starve us out.

576
01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:59.640
- we could collect nuts!
- yes! And throw them
at the telmarines.

577
01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:01.840
Shut up!

578
01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:04.320
I think you know
where I stand, sire.

579
01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:12.920
If I get your troops in,
can you handle the guards?

580
01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:20.160
Or die trying, my liege.

581
01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:22.320
[Lucy] That's what
I'm worried about.

582
01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:25.480
Sorry?

583
01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:28.880
You're all acting like
there's only two options.

584
01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:31.280
Dying here, or dying there.

585
01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:35.360
- I'm not sure you've
been listening.
- no, you're not listening.

586
01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:39.160
Or have you forgotten
who really defeated
the white witch, peter?

587
01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:44.320
I think we've waited
for aslan long enough.

588
01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.360
[Grunts]

589
01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:44.800
- shh.
- [Grunts]

590
01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:55.360
[Chittering]

591
01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:39.880
Professor?

592
01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:06.400
- I have to find him.
- you don't have time.

593
01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:08.200
you need to get the gate open.

594
01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:10.400
you wouldn't be
here without him.

595
01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:12.200
And neither would I.

596
01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:17.760
You and I can deal with miraz.

597
01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:20.400
And I can still get
to the gate in time.

598
01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:49.480
- yes, I'm a mouse. Hyah!
- [Grunts]

599
01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:11.560
Ah! We were expecting someone,
you know, taller.

600
01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:15.920
- you're one to talk.
- is that supposed
to be irony?

601
01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:26.920
Five more minutes?

602
01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:31.400
What are you doing here?

603
01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:35.800
I didn't help you escape just
so you could break back in.

604
01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:37.480
You have to get out

605
01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:40.160
before miraz
learns you're here.

606
01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:42.880
He's going
to learn soon enough.

607
01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:44.920
We are giving him your cell.

608
01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:50.280
Don't underestimate miraz
as your father did.

609
01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:53.920
What are you talking about?

610
01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:57.160
I'm sorry.

611
01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:18.440
[Chuckles]
Thank goodness you're safe.

612
01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:20.200
Get up.

613
01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:26.880
- [Prunaprismia] Caspian?
- stay where you are.

614
01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:28.200
What are you doing?

615
01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:30.720
I should think it's obvious,
dear.

616
01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:34.760
Some families might consider
this inappropriate behavior.

617
01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:36.880
That doesn't seem
to have stopped you!

618
01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:39.560
But you are not like me,
are you?

619
01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:44.800
It's sad. The first time
you've shown any backbone...

620
01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:46.560
...And it's such a waste.

621
01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:52.400
Put the sword down, caspian.

622
01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:57.560
- I don't want to do this.
- we don't want you to either.

623
01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:04.160
This used to be
a private room.

624
01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:07.480
What are you doing? You're
supposed to be
in the gatehouse!

625
01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:09.760
No!

626
01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:12.880
Tonight for once,
I want the truth.

627
01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:16.240
Did you kill my father?

628
01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:22.480
Now we get to it.

629
01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:25.760
You said your brother
died in his sleep.

630
01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:27.760
That was more or less true.

631
01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:30.880
Caspian, this won't
make things any better.

632
01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:33.760
We telmarines would have
nothing had we not taken it.

633
01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:36.600
Your father knew that
as well as anyone.

634
01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:38.760
How could you?

635
01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:41.600
For the same reason
you will pull that trigger.

636
01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:44.280
- for our son.
- stop!

637
01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:47.200
- stay right there.
- you need to make a choice.

638
01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:49.800
Do you want our child
to be king?

639
01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:53.160
Or do you want him
to be like caspian here?

640
01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:58.240
- fatherless!
- no!

641
01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:00.840
- caspian!
- agh!

642
01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:04.800
[Screaming]

643
01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:25.840
[Bell Tolling]

644
01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.200
What is that supposed to mean?

645
01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:38.320
- [Man] We're under attack!
- [Man 2] sound the alarm!

646
01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:41.840
- [Man 3] men! Grab your bows!
- [Shouting]

647
01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:49.360
- peter!
- our troops are just outside!
Come on!

648
01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:55.240
Now, ed! Now!

649
01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:57.880
- signal the troops!
- I'm a bit busy, pete!

650
01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:12.320
Agh!

651
01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:15.920
Oh...

652
01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:23.840
Peter! It's too late. We have
to call it off while we can.

653
01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:25.880
[Peter] No, I
can still do this!

654
01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:28.920
Help me!

655
01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:39.240
[All Straining]

656
01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:49.920
Exactly who are you
doing this for, peter?

657
01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:56.320
Come on!

658
01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:07.880
Charge!

659
01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:15.320
[Man] We're under attack!

660
01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:23.440
[Man] Attack! Attack!

661
01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:34.920

- [Screaming]

[All Shouting]

663
01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:43.320
For narnia!

664
01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:03.800
Ah!

665
01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:25.200
Archers!

666
01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:28.400
[Man] Pick a target!

667
01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:31.960
Take aim!

668
01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:39.280
[Screaming]

669
01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:41.440

672
01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:25.880
Ah!

673

[Groaning]

674
01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:45.400
Get that gate closed.

675
01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:03.280
[Man Grunting behind door]

676
01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:33.960
[Roaring]

677
01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:40.440
Fall back!

678
01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:48.560
We need to retreat! Now!

679
01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:53.840
Go! Get her out of here!

680
01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:56.560
Back to the gate! Go!

681
01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:05.320
- caspian!
- I'll find him!

682
01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:10.200
Go! Get out! Go!
Get out! Retreat!

683
01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:16.600

685
01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:53.440
Give the order.

686
01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:57.320
My men are
still down there.

01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:14.840
What happened?

696
01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:16.560
Ask him.

697
01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:19.800
- peter.
- me?

698
01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:22.360
You could've called it off.
There was time.

699
01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:24.360
No, there wasn't,
thanks to you.

700
01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:27.280
If you kept to the plan,
those soldiers might be alive.

701
01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:29.680
If you'd stayed here
like I suggested,
they definitely would be!

702
01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:34.320
- you called us, remember?
- my first mistake.

703
01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:37.440
No. Your first mistake
was thinking you
could lead these people.

704
01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:39.400
Hey!

705
01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:44.200
I am not the one
who abandoned narnia.

706
01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:48.560
You invaded narnia.
You have no more right
to lead it than miraz does.

707
01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:53.400
You, him, your father...
Narnia's better off
without the lot of you.

708
01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:56.400
- [Screaming]
- [Edmund] Stop it!

709

[Gasping]

710
01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:39.920
What are you all
standing around for?

711
01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:44.960
Telmarines will
be here soon enough.

712
01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:51.440
Thank you...
My dear little friend.

713
01:23:56.920 --> 01:24:01.520
- well done, lads.
- move it faster, mate.
Too slow!

714
01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:13.600
[Man] Beruna
pledges its troops.

715
01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:17.520
[Man 2] galma
pledges its troops.

716

717
01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:24.640
[Man 4] ettinsmoor
pledges its troops.

718
01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:58.440
[Chanting] Long live the king!
Long live the king!

719
01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:04.560
[Crowd Continues chanting]

720
01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:26.920
Are you so glad
of that magic horn now, boy?

721
01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:31.920
Your kings and queens
have failed us.

722
01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:37.680
Your army's half dead.
And those that aren't
will be soon enough.

723
01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:41.640
What do you want?
Congratulations?

724
01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:47.800
You want your uncle's blood.
So do we.

725
01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:51.960
You want his throne?
We can get it for you.

726
01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:13.360
[Nikabrik] You tried
one ancient power. It failed.

727
01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:16.520
But there is
a power greater still.

728
01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:21.840
One that kept
even aslan at bay
for near a hundred years.

729
01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:28.840
- [Growling]
- [Rumbling]

730
01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:38.600
- who's there?
- [Rasping]

731
01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:40.600
[Voice] I am hunger.

732
01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:45.600
I am thirst.

733
01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:49.880
I can fast a hundred years...

734
01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:52.280
...And not die.

735
01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:55.880
I can lie a hundred nights
on the ice...

736
01:26:55.960 --> 01:26:58.320
...And not freeze.

737
01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:05.440
I can drink a river of blood
and not burst.

738
01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:10.480
Show me... Your enemies!

739
01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:14.800
What you hate, so will we.

740
01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:17.840
No one hates better than us.

741
01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:26.160
And you can...
Guarantee miraz's death?

742
01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:28.920
And more.

743
01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:43.280
Let the circle be drawn.

744
01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:47.360
[Speaking Foreign language]

[Shouting In foreign language]

746
01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:55.960
[Caspian] Wait.

747
01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:00.840
This isn't what I wanted.

748
01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:02.840
[Snarls]

749
01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:08.560
One drop of adam's blood
and you free me.

750
01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:11.280
Then I am yours, my king.

751
01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:13.400
No!

752
01:29:35.240 --> 01:29:36.840
[Peter] Stop!

753
01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:53.920
[Howling]

754
01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:56.320
[Grunts]

755
01:29:57.640 --> 01:29:59.200
[Screaming]

756
01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:15.440
[Gasps]

757
01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:20.640
Come on! Come.

758
01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:23.280
Get away from him!

759
01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:29.840
Peter, dear.

760
01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:32.440
I've missed you.

761
01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:35.840
Come.

762
01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:38.440
Just one drop.

763
01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:43.360
You know you can't
do this alone.

764
01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:17.320
I know. You had it sorted.

765
01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:09.280
Why did you never tell me
about my father?

766
01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:17.120
My mother was a black dwarf
from the northern mountains.

767
01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:20.680
I risked my life
all these years

768
01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:24.600
so that one day...

769
01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:29.080
...You might be a better king
than those before you.

770
01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:34.080
Then I have failed you.

771
01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:42.160
Everything I told you...
Everything I didn't...

772
01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:46.160
...It was only
because I believe in you.

773
01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:52.480
You have a chance
to become the most noble
contradiction in history.

774
01:32:55.480 --> 01:32:59.040
The telmarine
who saved narnia.

775
01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:25.640
You're lucky, you know.

776
01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:29.760
What do you mean?

777
01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:32.440
To have seen him.

778
01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:38.640
I wish he'd just given me
some sort of proof.

779
01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:44.720
Maybe we're the ones who need
to prove ourselves to him.

780
01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:52.680
Pete. You'd better
come quickly.

781
01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:58.560
Cakes and kettledrums.
That's your next big plan?

782
01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:04.440
Sending a little girl
into the darkest parts
of the forest? Alone!

783
01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:08.760
- it's our only chance.
- and she won't be alone.

784
01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:14.400
Haven't enough
of us died already?

785
01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:18.640
Nikabrik was my friend too.
But he lost hope.

786
01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:22.760
Queen lucy hasn't.
And neither have I.

787
01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:25.600
For aslan.

788
01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:27.600
For aslan!

789
01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:36.640
- then I'm going with you.
- no. We need you here.

790
01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:39.600
We have to hold them off
until lucy and susan get back.

791
01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:42.440
[Caspian] If I may...

792
01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:51.600
Miraz may be a tyrant
and a murderer...

793
01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:57.520
...But as king, he is
subject to the traditions...

794
01:35:57.560 --> 01:36:01.360
...And expectations
of his people.

795
01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:05.520
There is one in particular
that may buy us some time.

796
01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:16.360
Perhaps they intend
to surrender.

797
01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:18.240
No.

798
01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:25.240
They are much
too noble for that.

799
01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:29.480
"I, peter, by
the gift of aslan,
by election and by conquest,

800
01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:34.600
high king of narnia,
lord of cair paravel and
emperor of the lone islands,

801
01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:37.440
in order to prevent the
abominable effusion of blood,

802
01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:42.560
do hereby challenge the
usurper miraz to single combat
upon the field of battle.

803
01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:48.320
The fight shall be to
the death. The reward
shall be total surrender."

804
01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:53.320
- tell me, Prince edmund...
- king.

805
01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:58.400
- pardon me?
- it's "king edmund,"
actually.

806
01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:01.280
Just "king," though.
Peter's the high king.

807
01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:04.440
I know, it's confusing.

808
01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:09.440
Why would we risk
such a proposal

809
01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:13.240
when our armies could
wipe you out by nightfall?

810
01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:17.240
Haven't you already
underestimated our numbers?

811
01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:22.600
I mean, only a week ago
narnians were extinct.

812
01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:25.280
And so you will be again.

813
01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:27.320
Then you should
have little to fear.

814
01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:31.400
[Laughing] This is not
a question of bravery.

815
01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:35.440
So you're bravely refusing
to fight a swordsman
half your age?

816
01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:40.360
I didn't say I refused.

817
01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:42.800
[Man] You have our support,
your majesty.

818
01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:44.600
Whatever your decision.

819
01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:47.360
Sire, our military
advantage alone

820
01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:49.520
provides the perfect excuse
to avoid

821
01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:53.320
- what might otherwise be...
- I'm not avoiding anything!

822
01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:56.280
I was merely pointing out

823
01:37:56.360 --> 01:37:59.160
that my lord is well
within his rights to refuse.

824
01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:02.520
His majesty would
never refuse.

825
01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:05.400
He relishes the chance
to show the people

826
01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:07.960
the courage
of their new king.

827
01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:14.440
You.

828
01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:22.880
You should hope
your brother's sword
is sharper than his pen.

829
01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:31.520
Destrier has always served me
well. You are in good hands.

830

- thanks.

833
01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:52.640
Maybe it is time
you had this back.

834
01:38:54.880 --> 01:38:59.560
Why don't you hold on to it.
You might need
to call me again.

to call me again?

Well, feel free.

- take the reins.
- what are you doing?

have learned what they can
from this world.
