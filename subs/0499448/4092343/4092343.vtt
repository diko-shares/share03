1
00:01:07.059 --> 00:01:08.267
Towels.

2
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:39.840
Lord Miraz?

3
00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:42.343
You have a son.

4
00:01:45.681 --> 00:01:48.307
The heavens have blessed us.

5
00:01:51.061 --> 00:01:53.312
You know your orders.

6
00:01:57.985 --> 00:01:59.860
General Glozelle?

7
00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:03.990
Yes, my lord.

8
00:02:38.692 --> 00:02:39.817
Five more minutes.

9
00:02:39.901 --> 00:02:42.778
You won't be watching
the stars tonight, my prince.

10
00:02:42.863 --> 00:02:44.864
Come. We must hurry.

11
00:02:47.993 --> 00:02:51.203
Professor, what's going on?
-Your aunt has given birth ...

12
00:02:52.414 --> 00:02:53.748
...to a son.

13
00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:00.421
Come.

14
00:03:51.098 --> 00:03:53.307
You must make for the woods.

15
00:03:53.391 --> 00:03:55.768
The woods?
-They won't follow you there.

16
00:03:58.855 --> 00:04:01.524
It has taken me
many years to find this.

17
00:04:03.652 --> 00:04:06.695
Do not use it except
at your greatest need.

18
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.989
Will I ever see you again?

19
00:04:09.074 --> 00:04:12.034
I dearly hope so, my prince.

20
00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:15.955
There is so much more
I meant to tell you.

21
00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:19.708
Everything you know
is about to change.

22
00:04:19.793 --> 00:04:21.836
Close the drawbridge!

23
00:04:22.504 --> 00:04:23.963
Now, go.

24
00:04:29.761 --> 00:04:31.971
Halt!
-Halt!

25
00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:50.072
A son! A son!

26
00:04:50.157 --> 00:04:54.702
Lady Prunaprismia has this night
given Lord Miraz a son!

27
00:05:47.714 --> 00:05:51.675
Which of you superstitious old women
wants to spend the night in a cell?

28
00:08:04.017 --> 00:08:05.517
He's seen us.

29
00:08:19.741 --> 00:08:21.200
Take care of him.

30
00:08:27.874 --> 00:08:29.875
No!

31
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:37.216
Mind yourself, love.
-I'm sorry.

32
00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:39.009
Watch where you're going!

33
00:08:39.094 --> 00:08:40.761
Wait for me!

34
00:08:53.983 --> 00:08:56.485
You go to Saint Finbar's?

35
00:08:56.569 --> 00:08:57.778
That's right.

36
00:08:57.862 --> 00:09:01.240
I go to Hendon House.
Across the road.

37
00:09:02.367 --> 00:09:03.826
I've seen you ...

38
00:09:05.412 --> 00:09:06.870
...sitting by yourself.

39
00:09:09.416 --> 00:09:13.001
Yes, well,
I prefer to be left alone.

40
00:09:15.463 --> 00:09:16.922
Me, too.

41
00:09:17.799 --> 00:09:19.091
What's your name?

42
00:09:21.177 --> 00:09:23.470
Phyllis.
-Susan!

43
00:09:25.765 --> 00:09:27.808
You'd better come quickly.

44
00:09:31.688 --> 00:09:33.230
Paper here!

45
00:09:34.274 --> 00:09:35.941
Get your daily paper!

46
00:10:13.813 --> 00:10:14.813
Edmund!

47
00:10:17.317 --> 00:10:19.359
Go on! Kick him in the face!

48
00:10:32.248 --> 00:10:34.958
Stop it. Break it up.
That's enough. Come on.

49
00:10:36.336 --> 00:10:38.170
That's it. Get up.

50
00:10:39.339 --> 00:10:40.506
Act your age!

51
00:10:49.432 --> 00:10:52.226
You're welcome.
-I had it sorted.

52
00:10:53.853 --> 00:10:55.354
What was it this time?

53
00:10:56.356 --> 00:10:58.941
He bumped me.
-So you hit him?

54
00:10:59.025 --> 00:11:03.445
No. After he bumped me,
they tried to make me apologize.

55
00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:05.239
That's when I hit him.
-Really?

56
00:11:05.323 --> 00:11:08.450
Is it that hard just to walk away?
-I shouldn't have to.

57
00:11:08.535 --> 00:11:11.662
I mean, don,t you ever get tired
of being treated like a kid?

58
00:11:11.746 --> 00:11:13.288
We are kids.

59
00:11:13.373 --> 00:11:15.249
Well, I wasn't always.

60
00:11:16.709 --> 00:11:18.377
It's been a year.

61
00:11:19.796 --> 00:11:21.838
How long does he
expect us to wait?

62
00:11:21.923 --> 00:11:24.550
I think it's time to accept
that we live here.

63
00:11:24.634 --> 00:11:27.052
It's no use pretending
any different.

64
00:11:29.889 --> 00:11:31.390
Oh, no.

65
00:11:33.059 --> 00:11:36.228
Pretend you're talking to me.
-We are talking to you.

66
00:11:38.773 --> 00:11:41.316
Quiet, Lu.
-Something pinched me!

67
00:11:41.401 --> 00:11:42.901
Stop pulling!
-Not touching you.

68
00:11:42.986 --> 00:11:46.238
Look, would all of you just ...
What is that?

69
00:11:46.322 --> 00:11:48.657
It feels like magic.
-Everyone hold hands.

70
00:11:48.741 --> 00:11:50.742
I'm not holding your hand!
-Just ...

71
00:12:57.352 --> 00:12:59.227
Shame you're not
as quick as me, Ed!

72
00:12:59.312 --> 00:13:01.647
Last one in's a rotten egg.

73
00:13:01.731 --> 00:13:02.856
Watch out!

74
00:13:04.484 --> 00:13:06.193
Here it comes!

75
00:13:14.535 --> 00:13:16.203
Wait a minute!

76
00:13:19.999 --> 00:13:21.667
Come on, Susan. Hurry up!

77
00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:24.294
Come on, it's lovely.

78
00:13:26.547 --> 00:13:27.881
Edmund.

79
00:13:30.176 --> 00:13:32.511
Ed? Ed!

80
00:13:37.517 --> 00:13:40.644
What is it?
-Where do you suppose we are?

81
00:13:40.728 --> 00:13:42.604
Well, where do you think?

82
00:13:42.689 --> 00:13:45.524
Well, I don't remember
any ruins in Narnia.

83
00:14:38.828 --> 00:14:40.579
Wonder who lived here.

84
00:14:48.254 --> 00:14:50.297
I think we did.

85
00:14:58.681 --> 00:15:00.182
Hey, that's mine.

86
00:15:00.266 --> 00:15:02.684
From my chess set.
-Which chess set?

87
00:15:02.769 --> 00:15:06.229
I didn't exactly have a solid gold
chess set in Finchley, did I?

88
00:15:11.778 --> 00:15:13.278
Can't be.

89
00:15:20.787 --> 00:15:22.621
Don't you see?
-What?

90
00:15:24.499 --> 00:15:25.832
Imagine walls.

91
00:15:28.836 --> 00:15:30.462
And columns, there.

92
00:15:34.967 --> 00:15:37.427
And a glass roof.

93
00:15:45.853 --> 00:15:47.395
Cair Paravel.

94
00:16:23.224 --> 00:16:26.268
Wait. Wait, my lord.
It is not what you think.

95
00:16:26.352 --> 00:16:28.603
Then what is it?

96
00:16:28.688 --> 00:16:30.522
We're not exactly sure.

97
00:16:35.903 --> 00:16:37.821
Impossible.

98
00:16:47.331 --> 00:16:51.751
I warned this council when it
put its trust in Lord Miraz ...

99
00:16:52.879 --> 00:16:55.338
... there would be consequences.
-No.

100
00:16:55.423 --> 00:16:58.300
We can't accuse the Lord
Protector without proof.

101
00:16:58.384 --> 00:17:01.469
How long are we going
to hide behind that excuse?

102
00:17:01.554 --> 00:17:04.723
Until every chair
in this chamber is empty?

103
00:17:06.225 --> 00:17:09.978
Lords of the council,
my apologies for being late.

104
00:17:10.062 --> 00:17:12.814
I wasn't aware we were in session.

105
00:17:13.482 --> 00:17:15.984
No doubt you were
otherwise occupied.

106
00:17:18.654 --> 00:17:20.196
My lord?

107
00:17:20.948 --> 00:17:24.075
Ever since the death
of Caspian the ninth,

108
00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.537
you've behaved
as if you were king.

109
00:17:27.622 --> 00:17:31.833
Now it seems that from behind his walls
even Prince Caspian has gone missing.

110
00:17:32.835 --> 00:17:35.837
My deepest condolences, Lord Miraz.

111
00:17:36.339 --> 00:17:39.507
Imagine, losing your nephew,

112
00:17:39.592 --> 00:17:42.010
the rightful heir to the throne,

113
00:17:42.094 --> 00:17:45.680
on the very night your wife
has blessed you with a son.

114
00:17:47.016 --> 00:17:49.434
Thank you, Lord Sopespian.

115
00:17:49.518 --> 00:17:52.854
Your compassion is a boon
in this troubled time.

116
00:17:52.939 --> 00:17:56.608
I trust you can tell us how such
a tragedy could have occurred.

117
00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:05.617
That is the most
disturbing news of all.

118
00:18:10.331 --> 00:18:15.043
Our beloved Caspian was abducted ...

119
00:18:18.464 --> 00:18:20.507
...by Narnians.

120
00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:23.551
You go too far, Miraz.

121
00:18:23.636 --> 00:18:28.306
Expect us to stand by while you blame
such a blatant crime on fairy tales?

122
00:18:34.981 --> 00:18:36.272
What?

123
00:18:38.776 --> 00:18:43.154
We forget, my lords,
Narnia was once a savage land.

124
00:18:44.448 --> 00:18:46.491
Fierce creatures roamed free.

125
00:18:47.868 --> 00:18:51.538
Much of our forefathers,
blood was shed

126
00:18:51.622 --> 00:18:54.165
to exterminate this vermin.

127
00:19:00.131 --> 00:19:02.507
Or so we thought.

128
00:19:03.342 --> 00:19:06.594
But while we've been bickering
amongst ourselves ...

129
00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:12.934
...they've been breeding
like cockroaches under a rock!

130
00:19:13.019 --> 00:19:16.688
Growing stronger. Watching us.

131
00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:21.735
Waiting to strike!

132
00:19:26.323 --> 00:19:30.201
And you wonder why
we don't like you.

133
00:19:31.704 --> 00:19:35.331
Well, I intend to strike back.

134
00:19:37.376 --> 00:19:41.171
Even if I have to cut down
the entire forest,

135
00:19:41.255 --> 00:19:45.258
I assure you,
I will find Prince Caspian

136
00:19:45.342 --> 00:19:49.512
and finish what our ancestors began.

137
00:20:07.239 --> 00:20:09.616
Catapults.
-What?

138
00:20:10.951 --> 00:20:15.080
This didn't just happen.
Cair Paravel was attacked.

139
00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:04.838
Don't suppose you have
any matches, do you?

140
00:21:06.799 --> 00:21:08.174
No, but ...

141
00:21:09.301 --> 00:21:10.760
...would this help?

142
00:21:10.845 --> 00:21:13.680
You might have mentioned that
a bit sooner.

143
00:21:55.764 --> 00:21:58.600
I can't believe it.
It's all still here.

144
00:22:12.114 --> 00:22:14.657
I was so tall.

145
00:22:14.742 --> 00:22:16.784
Well, you were older then.

146
00:22:18.329 --> 00:22:21.664
As opposed to hundreds of years
later ... when you're younger.

147
00:22:35.721 --> 00:22:37.972
What is it?
-My horn.

148
00:22:38.057 --> 00:22:41.517
I must've left it on my saddle
the day we went back.

149
00:23:03.123 --> 00:23:06.584
When Aslan bares his teeth,
winter meets its death.

150
00:23:08.254 --> 00:23:10.088
When he shakes his mane ...

151
00:23:11.966 --> 00:23:13.675
...we shall have spring again.

152
00:23:17.596 --> 00:23:23.017
Everyone we knew ...
Mr. Tumnus and the Beavers ...

153
00:23:25.771 --> 00:23:27.021
...they're all gone.

154
00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:36.823
I think it's time we found out
what's going on.

155
00:23:50.254 --> 00:23:51.921
He won't stop staring.

156
00:23:52.631 --> 00:23:53.965
So don't look.

157
00:24:07.313 --> 00:24:08.980
Here's far enough.

158
00:24:18.324 --> 00:24:19.574
Drop him!

159
00:24:19.658 --> 00:24:21.993
Crows and crockery!

160
00:25:04.828 --> 00:25:06.371
"Drop him"!

161
00:25:08.999 --> 00:25:11.459
That's the best
you can come up with?

162
00:25:11.543 --> 00:25:13.628
A simple "thank you" would suffice.

163
00:25:13.712 --> 00:25:16.631
They were doing fine
drowning me without your help.

164
00:25:16.715 --> 00:25:18.424
Maybe we should have let them.

165
00:25:19.385 --> 00:25:21.594
Why were they trying
to kill you, anyway?

166
00:25:23.263 --> 00:25:26.182
They're Telmarines.
That's what they do.

167
00:25:26.266 --> 00:25:29.477
Telmarines? In Narnia?

168
00:25:29.561 --> 00:25:32.688
Where have you been
for the last few hundred years?

169
00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:35.316
It's a bit of a long story.

170
00:25:44.785 --> 00:25:47.703
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

171
00:25:49.415 --> 00:25:50.998
You're it?

172
00:25:51.083 --> 00:25:54.043
You're the kings and queens of old?

173
00:25:55.337 --> 00:25:57.880
High King Peter, the Magnificent.

174
00:25:58.715 --> 00:26:01.092
You probably could've
left off the last bit.

175
00:26:02.761 --> 00:26:04.178
Probably.

176
00:26:06.265 --> 00:26:07.598
You might be surprised.

177
00:26:09.601 --> 00:26:12.520
You don't want to do that, boy.

178
00:26:12.604 --> 00:26:14.647
Not me. Him.

179
00:26:32.207 --> 00:26:33.416
Edmund!

180
00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:36.294
You all right?

181
00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:58.232
Beards and bedsteads!

182
00:26:58.317 --> 00:27:01.152
Maybe that horn worked after all.

183
00:27:01.987 --> 00:27:03.279
What horn?

184
00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:25.927
This bread is so stale.

185
00:27:26.011 --> 00:27:29.430
I'll just get him some soup.
He should be coming around soon.

186
00:27:29.515 --> 00:27:31.766
I don't think
I hit him hard enough.

187
00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:33.559
Nikabrik, he's just a boy.

188
00:27:33.644 --> 00:27:38.022
He's a Telmarine, not some lost puppy.
You said you were gonna get rid of him.

189
00:27:38.106 --> 00:27:41.609
No. I said I'd take care of him.

190
00:27:41.693 --> 00:27:44.987
We can't kill him now.
I just bandaged his head.

191
00:27:45.072 --> 00:27:47.990
It would be like murdering a guest.

192
00:27:48.075 --> 00:27:50.451
How do you think his friends
are treating their guest?

193
00:27:50.536 --> 00:27:54.080
Trumpkin knew what he was doing.
It's not the boy's fault.

194
00:27:58.544 --> 00:28:00.002
Stop! Stop!

195
00:28:00.712 --> 00:28:02.797
Hold it. No, no!

196
00:28:02.881 --> 00:28:05.883
I told you we should have killed him
when we had the chance.

197
00:28:05.968 --> 00:28:09.220
You know why we can't.
-If we're taking a vote, I'm with him.

198
00:28:09.304 --> 00:28:11.389
We can't let him go. He's seen us.

199
00:28:11.473 --> 00:28:13.015
That's enough, Nikabrik!

200
00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:15.268
Or do I have to sit
on your head again?

201
00:28:16.895 --> 00:28:19.605
And you.
Look what you made me do.

202
00:28:20.607 --> 00:28:22.942
I spent half the morning
on that soup.

203
00:28:24.403 --> 00:28:26.153
What are you?

204
00:28:26.238 --> 00:28:29.490
You know, it's funny
that you would ask that.

205
00:28:29.575 --> 00:28:31.993
You think people would know
a badger when they saw one.

206
00:28:32.077 --> 00:28:33.619
No. No, I mean ...

207
00:28:35.122 --> 00:28:38.416
...you're Narnians.
You're supposed to be extinct.

208
00:28:39.209 --> 00:28:40.751
Sorry to disappoint you.

209
00:28:44.089 --> 00:28:47.466
Here you go. Still hot.

210
00:28:47.551 --> 00:28:51.012
Since when did we open a boarding
house for Telmarine soldiers?

211
00:28:51.096 --> 00:28:52.388
I'm not a soldier.

212
00:28:53.432 --> 00:28:57.101
I am Prince Caspian. The tenth.

213
00:28:58.103 --> 00:29:00.271
What are you doing here?

214
00:29:02.441 --> 00:29:03.983
Running away.

215
00:29:07.779 --> 00:29:10.906
My uncle has always
wanted my throne.

216
00:29:13.201 --> 00:29:16.203
I suppose I have only
lived this long

217
00:29:16.288 --> 00:29:18.914
because he did not have
an heir of his own.

218
00:29:21.293 --> 00:29:25.880
Well, that changes things.
-Yeah.

219
00:29:25.964 --> 00:29:28.215
Means we don't have
to kill you ourselves.

220
00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:30.593
You're right.

221
00:29:32.721 --> 00:29:35.806
Where are you going?
-My uncle won't stop until I am dead.

222
00:29:35.891 --> 00:29:39.477
But you can't leave.
You're meant to save us.

223
00:29:40.687 --> 00:29:43.105
Don't you know what this is?

224
00:30:10.384 --> 00:30:12.968
You have quite a library, doctor.

225
00:30:15.972 --> 00:30:19.892
Is there anything particular
you seek, my lord?

226
00:30:19.976 --> 00:30:23.479
I think I've already found
what I'm looking for ...

227
00:30:25.524 --> 00:30:28.359
...in one of my soldiers!

228
00:30:47.087 --> 00:30:50.256
What do you know
of Queen Susan's horn?

229
00:30:51.007 --> 00:30:53.634
It was said to be magic.

230
00:30:53.719 --> 00:30:55.386
Magic?

231
00:30:55.470 --> 00:31:00.558
The Narnians believed it could summon
their kings and queens of old.

232
00:31:01.351 --> 00:31:04.687
At least, such was the superstition.

233
00:31:07.441 --> 00:31:11.819
And what does Caspian
know of this superstition?

234
00:31:11.903 --> 00:31:17.074
My lord, you forbade me
from mentioning the old tales.

235
00:31:19.077 --> 00:31:21.203
So I did.

236
00:31:27.836 --> 00:31:33.007
I will say this. If Caspian
does know of the Deep Magic,

237
00:31:33.091 --> 00:31:36.427
my lord would have
good reason to be nervous.

238
00:31:51.276 --> 00:31:53.110
First our prince ...

239
00:31:53.945 --> 00:31:55.529
...now his tutor.

240
00:31:55.614 --> 00:31:58.824
If the members of Miraz's
own house are not safe,

241
00:31:58.909 --> 00:32:02.203
are any of us?
-Lord Sopespian!

242
00:32:02.287 --> 00:32:05.247
Those are dangerous words,
Lord Sopespian.

243
00:32:05.332 --> 00:32:08.125
But these are
dangerous times, general.

244
00:32:08.627 --> 00:32:13.172
One should choose his words as
carefully as he chooses his friends.

245
00:32:18.136 --> 00:32:21.305
How long until the
bridge is finished?

246
00:32:21.389 --> 00:32:24.850
Construction continues on schedule.
-That's not good enough.

247
00:32:24.935 --> 00:32:27.228
I need my army across that river now.

248
00:32:27.312 --> 00:32:30.397
May I suggest you contribute
some of your own men?

249
00:32:30.482 --> 00:32:32.691
I've only so many at my disposal.

250
00:32:33.276 --> 00:32:36.237
A fact you'd be wise to remember.

251
00:32:38.365 --> 00:32:39.949
Go to Beruna.

252
00:32:40.033 --> 00:32:44.370
Take as many troops as you need.
We must get to Caspian before they do.

253
00:32:45.664 --> 00:32:46.997
"They," my lord?

254
00:32:47.082 --> 00:32:49.834
It's time you learned your history.

255
00:33:19.948 --> 00:33:21.156
They're so still.

256
00:33:24.035 --> 00:33:26.912
They're trees. What'd you expect?

257
00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:30.749
They used to dance.

258
00:33:32.836 --> 00:33:35.880
Wasn't long after you left
that the Telmarines invaded.

259
00:33:37.215 --> 00:33:39.800
Those who survived
retreated to the woods.

260
00:33:39.885 --> 00:33:42.303
And the trees,

261
00:33:42.387 --> 00:33:47.057
they retreated so deep into themselves
that they haven't been heard from since.

262
00:33:47.142 --> 00:33:51.145
I don't understand. How could
Aslan have let this happen?

263
00:33:51.229 --> 00:33:52.563
Aslan?

264
00:33:53.231 --> 00:33:55.900
Thought he abandoned us
when you lot did.

265
00:34:00.906 --> 00:34:03.032
We didn't mean to leave, you know.

266
00:34:04.409 --> 00:34:06.744
Makes no difference now, does it?

267
00:34:06.828 --> 00:34:09.246
Get us to the Narnians ...

268
00:34:09.915 --> 00:34:11.373
...and it will.

269
00:34:48.995 --> 00:34:50.245
Hello, there.

270
00:34:55.293 --> 00:34:58.212
It's all right. We're friends.

271
00:35:04.678 --> 00:35:06.136
Don't move, Your Majesty.

272
00:35:13.645 --> 00:35:15.145
Stay away from her!

273
00:35:19.484 --> 00:35:20.859
Shoot, Susan! Shoot!

274
00:35:34.582 --> 00:35:38.711
Why wouldn't he stop?
-I suspect he was hungry.

275
00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:54.727
Thanks.

276
00:35:57.856 --> 00:35:59.440
He was wild.

277
00:36:01.109 --> 00:36:03.235
I don't think he could talk at all.

278
00:36:04.446 --> 00:36:07.114
Get treated like
a dumb animal long enough,

279
00:36:07.198 --> 00:36:09.158
that's what you become.

280
00:36:11.327 --> 00:36:14.705
You may find Narnia a more
savage place than you remember.

281
00:36:33.224 --> 00:36:34.892
I can hear you.

282
00:36:37.687 --> 00:36:40.856
I just think we should wait
for the kings and queens.

283
00:36:42.609 --> 00:36:45.819
Fine! Go then! See if the others
will be as understanding!

284
00:36:45.904 --> 00:36:47.404
Or maybe I'll come with you.

285
00:36:47.489 --> 00:36:50.115
I want to see you
explain things to the minotaurs.

286
00:36:51.743 --> 00:36:52.910
Minotaurs?

287
00:36:54.329 --> 00:36:55.496
They're real?

288
00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:57.039
And very bad-tempered.

289
00:36:57.123 --> 00:37:00.459
Yeah, not to mention big.
-Huge.

290
00:37:01.795 --> 00:37:04.671
What about centaurs?
Do they still exist?

291
00:37:04.756 --> 00:37:07.716
Well, the centaurs will
probably fight on your side.

292
00:37:07.801 --> 00:37:10.886
But there's no telling
what the others will do.

293
00:37:12.806 --> 00:37:14.348
What about Aslan?

294
00:37:19.854 --> 00:37:22.356
How do you know so much about us?

295
00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:25.109
Stories.
-Wait a minute.

296
00:37:25.193 --> 00:37:27.861
Your father told you
stories about Narnia?

297
00:37:28.696 --> 00:37:30.364
No, my professor, he ...

298
00:37:32.617 --> 00:37:33.700
Listen, I'm sorry.

299
00:37:33.785 --> 00:37:37.621
These are not the kind of questions
you should be asking.

300
00:37:40.125 --> 00:37:42.376
What is it?
-Human.

301
00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:45.129
Him?
-No. Them.

302
00:37:48.633 --> 00:37:50.843
There they are!
-Run!

303
00:38:03.356 --> 00:38:04.773
Now!

304
00:38:14.325 --> 00:38:16.451
Oh, no.
-Wait. I'll go.

305
00:38:22.167 --> 00:38:25.002
Take it. Go!
It's more important than I am.

306
00:38:58.244 --> 00:39:00.204
Get him out of here.

307
00:39:10.715 --> 00:39:11.965
Where are you?

308
00:39:27.899 --> 00:39:31.777
Choose your last words
carefully, Telmarine.

309
00:39:33.238 --> 00:39:34.488
You are a mouse.

310
00:39:36.366 --> 00:39:39.076
I was hoping for something
a little more original.

311
00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:40.535
Pick up your sword.

312
00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:45.332
No, thanks.

313
00:39:45.416 --> 00:39:48.669
Pick it up! I will not fight
an unarmed man.

314
00:39:48.753 --> 00:39:50.796
Which is why I might live longer

315
00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:53.674
if I choose not to cross blades
with you, noble mouse.

316
00:39:53.758 --> 00:39:57.302
I said I would not fight you.
I didn't say I'd let you live!

317
00:39:57.387 --> 00:39:59.012
Reepicheep!

318
00:39:59.097 --> 00:40:01.223
Stay your blade!
-Trufflehunter?

319
00:40:01.307 --> 00:40:05.352
I trust you have a very good reason
for this untimely interruption.

320
00:40:05.436 --> 00:40:08.897
He doesn't. Go ahead.
-He's the one who blew the horn.

321
00:40:10.858 --> 00:40:13.944
What?
-Then let him bring it forward.

322
00:40:17.615 --> 00:40:20.409
This is the reason we have gathered.

323
00:40:26.124 --> 00:40:27.374
I don't remember this way.

324
00:40:27.458 --> 00:40:30.669
That's the problem with girls.
You can't carry a map in your heads.

325
00:40:30.753 --> 00:40:33.880
That's because our heads
have something in them.

326
00:40:33.965 --> 00:40:37.551
I wish he'd just listen
to the D.L.F. in the first place.

327
00:40:37.635 --> 00:40:40.762
D.L.F.?
-Dear Little Friend.

328
00:40:42.307 --> 00:40:45.475
Oh, that's not at all
patronizing, is it?

329
00:40:48.646 --> 00:40:50.772
I'm not lost.

330
00:40:50.857 --> 00:40:51.982
No.

331
00:40:53.526 --> 00:40:56.069
You're just going the wrong way.

332
00:40:56.154 --> 00:40:58.613
You last saw Caspian
at the Shuddering Woods,

333
00:40:58.698 --> 00:41:01.658
and the quickest way there
is to cross at the river Rush.

334
00:41:01.743 --> 00:41:05.078
But unless I'm mistaken,
there's no crossing in these parts.

335
00:41:05.163 --> 00:41:08.206
That explains it, then.
You're mistaken.

336
00:41:31.022 --> 00:41:34.941
You see, over time, water erodes
the earth's soil, carving deeper ...

337
00:41:35.026 --> 00:41:36.651
Oh, shut up.

338
00:41:36.736 --> 00:41:39.946
Is there a way down?
-Yeah, falling.

339
00:41:40.031 --> 00:41:42.949
Well, we weren't lost.

340
00:41:43.034 --> 00:41:46.203
There's a ford near Beruna.
How do you feel about swimming?

341
00:41:46.287 --> 00:41:48.330
I'd rather that than walking.

342
00:41:49.624 --> 00:41:51.041
Aslan?

343
00:41:51.626 --> 00:41:54.503
It's Aslan!
It's Aslan over there!

344
00:41:55.171 --> 00:41:57.047
Don't you see? He's right ...

345
00:42:01.177 --> 00:42:02.427
...there.

346
00:42:03.221 --> 00:42:05.472
Do you see him now?

347
00:42:06.724 --> 00:42:08.517
I'm not crazy.

348
00:42:08.601 --> 00:42:11.395
He was there.
He wanted us to follow him.

349
00:42:14.482 --> 00:42:17.442
I'm sure there are any number
of lions in this wood.

350
00:42:17.527 --> 00:42:20.570
Just like that bear. -I think
I know Aslan when I see him.

351
00:42:21.906 --> 00:42:24.491
Look, I'm not about
to jump off a cliff

352
00:42:24.575 --> 00:42:26.701
after someone who doesn't exist.

353
00:42:26.786 --> 00:42:29.162
The last time I didn't believe Lucy

354
00:42:29.247 --> 00:42:31.706
I ended up looking pretty stupid.

355
00:42:37.588 --> 00:42:39.423
Why wouldn't I have seen him?

356
00:42:39.507 --> 00:42:41.842
Maybe you weren't looking.

357
00:42:43.886 --> 00:42:45.137
I'm sorry, Lu.

358
00:43:11.789 --> 00:43:13.415
Kill him!

359
00:43:13.499 --> 00:43:15.208
Telmarine!
-Liar!

360
00:43:16.461 --> 00:43:17.586
Murderer!

361
00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:20.881
All this horn proves is they've
stolen yet another thing from us!

362
00:43:20.965 --> 00:43:23.884
I didn't steal anything.
-Didn't steal anything?

363
00:43:23.968 --> 00:43:26.761
Shall we list the things
the Telmarines have taken?

364
00:43:26.846 --> 00:43:28.472
Our homes!
-Our land!

365
00:43:28.556 --> 00:43:30.849
Our freedom!
-Our lives!

366
00:43:30.933 --> 00:43:32.058
You stole Narnia!

367
00:43:32.143 --> 00:43:35.437
You would hold me accountable
for all the crimes of my people?

368
00:43:35.521 --> 00:43:36.938
Accountable ...

369
00:43:37.857 --> 00:43:39.399
...and punishable.

370
00:43:40.526 --> 00:43:42.903
That is rich coming from you, dwarf.

371
00:43:42.987 --> 00:43:47.032
Have you forgotten it was your people
who fought alongside the White Witch?

372
00:43:47.116 --> 00:43:50.911
And I'd gladly do it again,
if it would rid us of these barbarians.

373
00:43:50.995 --> 00:43:54.498
Then it's lucky that it is not
in your power to bring her back.

374
00:43:55.583 --> 00:43:59.044
Or are you suggesting that we ask
this boy to go against Aslan now?

375
00:44:02.423 --> 00:44:06.009
Some of you may have forgotten,
but we badgers remember well,

376
00:44:06.093 --> 00:44:10.764
that Narnia was never right
except when a Son of Adam was king.

377
00:44:10.848 --> 00:44:13.767
He's a Telmarine!
Why would we want him as our king?

378
00:44:13.851 --> 00:44:15.727
Because I can help you.

379
00:44:15.811 --> 00:44:18.605
It's a trick!
-At least hear him out!

380
00:44:18.689 --> 00:44:22.275
Beyond these woods, I'm a prince.

381
00:44:23.152 --> 00:44:25.946
The Telmarine throne
is rightfully mine!

382
00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:30.283
Help me claim it,
and I can bring peace between us.

383
00:44:31.619 --> 00:44:35.539
It is true. The time is ripe.

384
00:44:36.707 --> 00:44:38.959
I watch the skies,

385
00:44:39.043 --> 00:44:43.672
for it is mine to watch
as it is yours to remember, badger.

386
00:44:45.258 --> 00:44:50.262
Tarva, the lord of victory,
and Alambil, the lady of peace,

387
00:44:50.346 --> 00:44:53.390
have come together
in the high heavens.

388
00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:59.104
And now here,
a Son of Adam has come forth ...

389
00:45:00.481 --> 00:45:03.400
...to offer us back our freedom.

390
00:45:03.484 --> 00:45:06.653
Is this possible? Do you really
think there could be peace?

391
00:45:06.737 --> 00:45:09.364
Do you? I mean, really?

392
00:45:09.448 --> 00:45:14.536
Two days ago, I didn't believe
in the existence of talking animals ...

393
00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:17.414
...or dwarves ... or centaurs.

394
00:45:18.958 --> 00:45:22.168
Yet here you are
in strength and numbers

395
00:45:22.253 --> 00:45:25.338
that we Telmarines
could never have imagined.

396
00:45:25.423 --> 00:45:30.760
Whether this horn is magic or not,
it brought us together.

397
00:45:31.637 --> 00:45:33.555
And together,

398
00:45:33.639 --> 00:45:36.349
we have a chance
to take back what is ours.

399
00:45:37.602 --> 00:45:42.897
If you will lead us,
then my sons and I ...

400
00:45:44.108 --> 00:45:46.776
...offer you our swords.

401
00:45:57.121 --> 00:46:00.498
And we offer you our lives,
unreservedly.

402
00:46:02.168 --> 00:46:05.920
Miraz's army will not
be far behind us, sire.

403
00:46:06.005 --> 00:46:11.051
If we are to be ready for them, we need
to hurry to find soldiers and weapons.

404
00:46:14.263 --> 00:46:17.390
I'm sure they will be here soon.

405
00:46:28.361 --> 00:46:30.904
These ones!
And these ones!

406
00:46:34.075 --> 00:46:36.159
Timber!

407
00:46:36.827 --> 00:46:39.496
Get back!
-Watch your back!

408
00:46:40.831 --> 00:46:42.374
Look out!

409
00:46:44.251 --> 00:46:46.795
Steady, steady!
-Timber!

410
00:47:04.188 --> 00:47:07.315
Perhaps this wasn't the best way
to come after all.

411
00:47:35.970 --> 00:47:38.680
So where exactly
do you think you saw Aslan?

412
00:47:41.225 --> 00:47:44.352
I wish you'd all stop trying
to sound like grown-ups.

413
00:47:44.437 --> 00:47:47.731
I don't think I saw him,
I did see him.

414
00:47:48.399 --> 00:47:50.567
I am a grown-up.

415
00:47:51.402 --> 00:47:53.570
It was right over ...

416
00:47:53.654 --> 00:47:55.405
Lucy!

417
00:48:00.494 --> 00:48:01.745
...here.

418
00:48:52.129 --> 00:48:54.130
Lucy, are you awake?

419
00:49:00.012 --> 00:49:02.180
Why do you think
I didn't see Aslan?

420
00:49:07.311 --> 00:49:09.354
You believe me?

421
00:49:09.438 --> 00:49:12.357
Well, we got across the gorge.

422
00:49:15.110 --> 00:49:17.111
I don't know.

423
00:49:19.031 --> 00:49:21.533
Maybe you didn't really want to.

424
00:49:25.329 --> 00:49:28.206
You always knew we'd be
coming back here, didn't you?

425
00:49:28.833 --> 00:49:30.583
I hoped so.

426
00:49:35.506 --> 00:49:39.509
I finally just got used
to the idea of being in England.

427
00:49:39.593 --> 00:49:42.011
But you're happy
to be here, aren't you?

428
00:49:43.889 --> 00:49:46.015
While it lasts.

429
00:51:51.225 --> 00:51:52.864
Lucy.

430
00:51:56.465 --> 00:51:58.065
Lucy.

431
00:52:06.657 --> 00:52:08.700
Aslan!

432
00:52:18.836 --> 00:52:21.546
I've missed you so much!

433
00:52:25.175 --> 00:52:27.677
You've grown.
-Every year you grow ...

434
00:52:27.761 --> 00:52:29.804
...so shall I.

435
00:52:31.682 --> 00:52:35.977
Where have you been?
Why haven't you come to help us?

436
00:52:37.187 --> 00:52:40.189
Things never happen
the same way twice, dear one.

437
00:52:48.198 --> 00:52:50.033
Susan! Wake up!

438
00:52:52.453 --> 00:52:56.039
Certainly, Lu.
Whatever you like.

439
00:53:18.687 --> 00:53:20.396
Wake up.

440
00:53:36.747 --> 00:53:38.206
Aslan?

441
00:54:16.995 --> 00:54:18.454
No, stop!

442
00:54:40.644 --> 00:54:42.562
Prince Caspian?

443
00:54:42.646 --> 00:54:45.273
Yes? And who are you?

444
00:54:45.357 --> 00:54:47.358
Peter!

445
00:54:57.244 --> 00:55:00.413
High King Peter.
-I believe you called.

446
00:55:00.497 --> 00:55:04.000
Well, yes, but ...
I thought you'd be older.

447
00:55:04.877 --> 00:55:07.628
If you like, we could
come back in a few years ...

448
00:55:08.005 --> 00:55:11.632
No. No, that's all right.
You're just ...

449
00:55:11.717 --> 00:55:14.677
You're not exactly what I expected.

450
00:55:17.848 --> 00:55:19.015
Neither are you.

451
00:55:20.392 --> 00:55:23.269
A common enemy unites
even the oldest of foes.

452
00:55:23.353 --> 00:55:27.607
We have anxiously awaited
your return, my liege.

453
00:55:27.691 --> 00:55:29.942
Our hearts and swords
are at your service.

454
00:55:30.027 --> 00:55:31.819
Oh, my gosh, he is so cute.

455
00:55:31.904 --> 00:55:35.323
Who said that?
-Sorry.

456
00:55:36.867 --> 00:55:40.203
Your Majesty,
with the greatest respect,

457
00:55:40.287 --> 00:55:43.789
I do believe "courageous,"
"courteous," or "chivalrous"

458
00:55:43.874 --> 00:55:46.042
might more befit a knight of Narnia.

459
00:55:46.126 --> 00:55:49.295
Well, at least we know some of you
can handle a blade.

460
00:55:49.379 --> 00:55:52.381
Yes, indeed. And I have
recently put it to good use,

461
00:55:52.466 --> 00:55:54.508
securing weapons for your army, sire.

462
00:55:54.593 --> 00:55:58.846
Good. Because we're going
to need every sword we can get.

463
00:55:58.931 --> 00:56:02.433
Well, then, you will probably
be wanting yours back.

464
00:56:22.037 --> 00:56:24.997
How much did they take?

465
00:56:25.082 --> 00:56:27.541
Enough weapons and armor
for two regiments.

466
00:56:27.626 --> 00:56:31.003
But ... there's more.

467
00:56:33.924 --> 00:56:37.426
"You were right to fear the woods."

468
00:56:37.511 --> 00:56:42.181
"X"?
-Caspian. The tenth.

469
00:56:42.266 --> 00:56:45.935
I apologize, my lord.
The blame is mine.

470
00:56:46.019 --> 00:56:47.603
I know.

471
00:56:49.356 --> 00:56:50.773
Tell me, general ...

472
00:56:52.359 --> 00:56:54.193
...how many men did you lose?

473
00:56:54.778 --> 00:56:57.905
None, my lord.
-None?

474
00:56:57.990 --> 00:57:03.160
They came like ghosts, in the
dead of night. We never saw them.

475
00:57:04.997 --> 00:57:07.832
Then how do you
explain your injuries?

476
00:57:16.967 --> 00:57:19.218
I asked ...

477
00:57:19.303 --> 00:57:21.554
...how many men were killed

478
00:57:21.638 --> 00:57:25.391
during this bloody Narnian attack?

479
00:57:26.852 --> 00:57:31.147
Of which you were
a fortunate survivor.

480
00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:35.651
General ...

481
00:57:36.570 --> 00:57:38.321
...how many?

482
00:57:53.003 --> 00:57:54.962
Three.

483
00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:05.973
I apologize, Lord Sopespian.

484
00:58:06.975 --> 00:58:11.937
Caspian is not a victim
of this savage uprising.

485
00:58:12.022 --> 00:58:13.564
He is the instigator.

486
00:58:18.695 --> 00:58:21.906
It seems Narnia is in need
of a new king.

487
00:58:31.291 --> 00:58:33.376
Well, it's good you have troops,

488
00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:37.171
but we need some fortifications.
Somewhere to train.

489
00:58:40.717 --> 00:58:44.387
So? What are they like?

490
00:58:44.471 --> 00:58:49.642
Malcontents, complainers,
stubborn as mules in the morning.

491
00:58:49.726 --> 00:58:51.685
So you like them, then.

492
00:58:52.938 --> 00:58:54.772
Well enough.

493
01:00:13.101 --> 01:00:17.980
It may not be what you are used to,
but it is defensible.

494
01:00:18.064 --> 01:00:20.941
Peter. You may want to see this.

495
01:00:36.333 --> 01:00:38.459
It's us.

496
01:00:40.837 --> 01:00:42.880
What is this place?

497
01:00:44.257 --> 01:00:45.925
You don't know?

498
01:02:22.814 --> 01:02:24.732
He must know what he's doing.

499
01:02:31.823 --> 01:02:33.782
I think it's up to us now.

500
01:03:06.816 --> 01:03:09.234
It's only a matter of time.

501
01:03:09.319 --> 01:03:13.238
Miraz's men and war machines
are on their way.

502
01:03:14.115 --> 01:03:17.117
That means those same men
aren't protecting his castle.

503
01:03:17.202 --> 01:03:18.911
What do you propose we do,
Your Majesty?

504
01:03:18.995 --> 01:03:21.664
We need to get ready for it.
-To start planning for ...

505
01:03:26.169 --> 01:03:29.763
Our only hope is to strike them
before they strike us.

506
01:03:29.764 --> 01:03:31.840
Well that's crazy.
No one has taken that castle.

507
01:03:31.925 --> 01:03:35.427
There's always a first time.
-We'll have the element of surprise.

508
01:03:35.512 --> 01:03:38.430
But we have the advantage here!
-If we dig in,

509
01:03:38.515 --> 01:03:41.392
we could probably
hold them off indefinitely.

510
01:03:43.186 --> 01:03:46.105
I, for one, feel safer underground.

511
01:03:46.189 --> 01:03:49.316
Look. I appreciate
what you've done here,

512
01:03:49.401 --> 01:03:51.944
but this isn't a fortress.
It's a tomb.

513
01:03:52.028 --> 01:03:53.612
Yes. And if they're smart,

514
01:03:53.697 --> 01:03:56.532
the Telmarines will just wait
and starve us out.

515
01:03:56.616 --> 01:04:00.452
We could collect nuts! -Yes!
And throw them at the Telmarines.

516
01:04:00.537 --> 01:04:02.663
Shut up!

517
01:04:02.747 --> 01:04:04.707
I think you know
where I stand, sire.

518
01:04:09.462 --> 01:04:13.382
If I get your troops in,
can you handle the guards?

519
01:04:17.721 --> 01:04:20.973
Or die trying, my liege.

520
01:04:21.057 --> 01:04:24.935
That's what I'm worried about.
-Sorry?

521
01:04:26.730 --> 01:04:29.648
You're all acting like
there's only two options.

522
01:04:29.733 --> 01:04:32.276
Dying here, or dying there.

523
01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:36.155
I'm not sure you've been listening.
-No, you're not listening.

524
01:04:36.239 --> 01:04:39.491
Or have you forgotten who really
defeated the White Witch, Peter?

525
01:04:41.953 --> 01:04:44.747
I think we've waited
for Aslan long enough.

526
01:08:39.691 --> 01:08:40.691
Professor?

527
01:09:04.632 --> 01:09:07.467
I have to find him.
-You don't have time.

528
01:09:07.552 --> 01:09:11.430
You need to get the gate open.
-You wouldn't be here without him.

529
01:09:11.514 --> 01:09:12.931
And neither would I.

530
01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:18.812
You and I can deal with Miraz.

531
01:09:18.896 --> 01:09:21.064
And I can still get
to the gate in time.

532
01:09:46.674 --> 01:09:48.759
Yes, I'm a mouse.

533
01:10:09.947 --> 01:10:12.699
We were expecting someone,
you know, taller.

534
01:10:12.784 --> 01:10:16.411
You're one to talk.
-Is that supposed to be irony?

535
01:10:25.463 --> 01:10:26.963
Five more minutes?

536
01:10:28.216 --> 01:10:30.801
What are you doing here?

537
01:10:32.386 --> 01:10:36.139
I didn't help you escape
just so you could break back in.

538
01:10:37.058 --> 01:10:38.725
You have to get out

539
01:10:38.810 --> 01:10:41.228
before Miraz learns you're here.

540
01:10:41.312 --> 01:10:43.146
He's going to learn soon enough.

541
01:10:44.148 --> 01:10:45.816
We are giving him your cell.

542
01:10:47.985 --> 01:10:51.154
Don't underestimate Miraz
as your father did.

543
01:10:52.782 --> 01:10:54.783
What are you talking about?

544
01:10:56.077 --> 01:10:57.953
I'm sorry.

545
01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:19.599
Thank goodness you're safe.

546
01:11:19.684 --> 01:11:21.017
Get up.

547
01:11:26.399 --> 01:11:28.150
Caspian?
-Stay where you are.

548
01:11:28.234 --> 01:11:31.778
What are you doing?
-I should think it's obvious, dear.

549
01:11:31.863 --> 01:11:35.866
You know, some families might
consider this inappropriate behavior.

550
01:11:35.950 --> 01:11:38.118
That doesn't seem to have stopped you!

551
01:11:38.202 --> 01:11:40.370
But you are not like me, are you?

552
01:11:42.206 --> 01:11:46.042
It's sad. The first time
you've shown any backbone ...

553
01:11:46.127 --> 01:11:47.544
...and it's such a waste.

554
01:11:50.798 --> 01:11:53.633
Put the sword down, Caspian.

555
01:11:54.635 --> 01:11:58.597
I don't want to do this.
-We don't want you to either.

556
01:12:03.728 --> 01:12:05.312
This used to be a private room.

557
01:12:05.396 --> 01:12:08.648
What are you doing? You're
supposed to be in the gatehouse!

558
01:12:08.733 --> 01:12:09.900
No!

559
01:12:10.902 --> 01:12:13.737
Tonight for once,
I want the truth.

560
01:12:15.406 --> 01:12:17.240
Did you kill my father?

561
01:12:21.954 --> 01:12:23.747
Now we get to it.

562
01:12:24.582 --> 01:12:26.917
You said your brother
died in his sleep.

563
01:12:27.001 --> 01:12:28.919
That was more or less true.

564
01:12:29.003 --> 01:12:32.172
Caspian, this won't
make things any better.

565
01:12:32.256 --> 01:12:35.258
We Telmarines would have
nothing had we not taken it.

566
01:12:35.343 --> 01:12:37.594
Your father knew that
as well as anyone.

567
01:12:38.512 --> 01:12:40.013
How could you?

568
01:12:40.097 --> 01:12:42.599
For the same reason
you will pull that trigger.

569
01:12:43.809 --> 01:12:45.769
For our son.
-Stop!

570
01:12:45.853 --> 01:12:48.688
Stay right there.
-You need to make a choice, dear.

571
01:12:48.773 --> 01:12:51.066
Do you want our child to be king?

572
01:12:51.150 --> 01:12:54.110
Or do you want him
to be like Caspian here?

573
01:12:57.281 --> 01:12:59.866
Fatherless!
-No!

574
01:12:59.951 --> 01:13:01.910
Caspian!

575
01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:34.192
What's that supposed to mean?

576
01:13:36.195 --> 01:13:39.739
We're under attack!
-Sound the alarm!

577
01:13:39.824 --> 01:13:42.784
Men! Grab your bows!

578
01:13:47.206 --> 01:13:50.333
Peter! -Our troops are
just outside! Come on!

579
01:13:55.172 --> 01:13:56.506
Now, Ed! Now!

580
01:13:56.590 --> 01:13:59.050
Signal the troops!
-I'm a bit busy, Pete!

581
01:14:21.741 --> 01:14:25.035
Peter! It's too late.
We have to call it off while we can.

582
01:14:25.119 --> 01:14:26.911
No, I can still do this!

583
01:14:28.789 --> 01:14:29.998
Help me!

584
01:14:47.558 --> 01:14:51.061
Exactly who are you
doing this for, Peter?

585
01:14:56.233 --> 01:14:57.442
Come on!

586
01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:08.953
Charge!

587
01:15:14.502 --> 01:15:16.419
We're under attack!

588
01:15:22.343 --> 01:15:24.636
Attack! Attack!

589
01:15:42.655 --> 01:15:44.447
For Narnia!

590
01:16:23.988 --> 01:16:26.197
Archers!

591
01:16:27.992 --> 01:16:29.492
Pick a target!

592
01:16:31.996 --> 01:16:33.037
Take aim!

593
01:16:41.672 --> 01:16:42.672
Ed!

594
01:17:44.944 --> 01:17:46.653
Get that gate closed.

595
01:18:40.332 --> 01:18:41.708
Fall back!

596
01:18:48.299 --> 01:18:49.966
We need to retreat! Now!

597
01:18:52.511 --> 01:18:54.679
Go! Get her out of here!

598
01:18:55.472 --> 01:18:58.057
Back to the gate! Go!

599
01:19:03.689 --> 01:19:07.233
Caspian!
-I'll find him!

600
01:19:07.318 --> 01:19:11.362
Go! Get out! Go!
Get out! Retreat!

601
01:19:16.327 --> 01:19:18.036
Follow me!

602
01:19:52.821 --> 01:19:54.113
Give the order.

603
01:19:56.784 --> 01:19:58.201
My men are still down there.

604
01:19:58.285 --> 01:20:01.537
Draw back!
Get out! Retreat!

605
01:20:05.459 --> 01:20:06.542
Now!

606
01:20:10.464 --> 01:20:12.090
Fire!

607
01:20:34.571 --> 01:20:37.782
Run for your life!
Save yourself!

608
01:20:52.089 --> 01:20:53.923
Peter! The bridge!

609
01:21:10.315 --> 01:21:11.774
Leave us! Go, brothers!

610
01:21:12.818 --> 01:21:15.903
In the name of Aslan!

611
01:22:14.171 --> 01:22:16.005
What happened?

612
01:22:16.089 --> 01:22:17.840
Ask him.

613
01:22:18.467 --> 01:22:20.927
Peter.
-Me?

614
01:22:21.011 --> 01:22:23.638
You could've called it off.
There was still time.

615
01:22:23.722 --> 01:22:25.389
No, there wasn't, thanks to you.

616
01:22:25.474 --> 01:22:28.267
If you kept to the plan,
those soldiers might be alive.

617
01:22:28.352 --> 01:22:31.145
If you'd stayed here like I suggested,
they definitely would be!

618
01:22:31.230 --> 01:22:35.149
You called us, remember?
-My first mistake.

619
01:22:35.234 --> 01:22:38.611
No. Your first mistake was thinking
you could lead these people.

620
01:22:41.782 --> 01:22:45.284
I am not the one who abandoned Narnia.

621
01:22:45.369 --> 01:22:49.789
You invaded Narnia. You have no more
right to lead it than Miraz does.

622
01:22:49.873 --> 01:22:51.582
You, him, your father ...

623
01:22:52.417 --> 01:22:55.002
Narnia's better off
without the lot of you.

624
01:22:55.879 --> 01:22:57.213
Stop it!

625
01:23:38.422 --> 01:23:41.007
What are you all
standing around for?

626
01:23:43.343 --> 01:23:45.887
Telmarines will be
here soon enough.

627
01:23:48.724 --> 01:23:52.268
Thank you ...
my dear little friend.

628
01:23:57.983 --> 01:24:02.612
Well done, lads.
-Move it faster, mate. Too slow!

629
01:24:12.372 --> 01:24:14.957
Beruna pledges its troops.

630
01:24:15.042 --> 01:24:18.920
Galma pledges its troops.

631
01:24:19.004 --> 01:24:21.881
Tashbaan pledges its troops.

632
01:24:21.965 --> 01:24:25.635
Ettinsmoor pledges its troops.

633
01:24:55.290 --> 01:24:58.835
Long live the king!
Long live the king!

634
01:24:59.336 --> 01:25:02.536
Long live the king!
Long live the king!

635
01:25:03.237 --> 01:25:06.637
Long live the king!
Long live the king!

636
01:25:07.138 --> 01:25:10.638
Long live the king!
Long live the king!

637
01:25:11.039 --> 01:25:14.239
Long live the king!
Long live the king!

638
01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:18.540
Long live the king!
Long live the king!

639
01:25:18.741 --> 01:25:22.541
Long live the king!
Long live the king!

640
01:25:24.861 --> 01:25:27.905
Are you so glad
of that magic horn now, boy?

641
01:25:30.075 --> 01:25:33.285
Your kings and queens have failed us.

642
01:25:33.370 --> 01:25:38.708
Your army's half dead. And those
that aren't will be soon enough.

643
01:25:40.168 --> 01:25:42.712
What do you want?
Congratulations?

644
01:25:44.172 --> 01:25:47.925
You want your uncle's blood.
So do we.

645
01:25:49.177 --> 01:25:53.014
You want his throne?
We can get it for you.

646
01:26:10.323 --> 01:26:14.702
You tried one ancient power.
It failed.

647
01:26:14.786 --> 01:26:17.913
But there is a power greater still.

648
01:26:18.832 --> 01:26:22.752
One that kept even Aslan at bay
for near a hundred years.

649
01:26:36.683 --> 01:26:38.976
Who's there?

650
01:26:40.062 --> 01:26:41.645
I am hunger.

651
01:26:44.691 --> 01:26:46.567
I am thirst.

652
01:26:48.111 --> 01:26:50.905
I can fast a hundred years ...

653
01:26:52.032 --> 01:26:53.616
...and not die.

654
01:26:54.451 --> 01:26:57.286
I can lie a hundred nights
on the ice ...

655
01:26:57.954 --> 01:26:59.789
...and not freeze.

656
01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:05.795
I can drink a river of blood
and not burst.

657
01:27:06.630 --> 01:27:10.800
Show me ... your enemies!

658
01:27:11.885 --> 01:27:16.055
What you hate, so will we.

659
01:27:16.139 --> 01:27:18.891
No one hates better than us.

660
01:27:22.646 --> 01:27:27.108
And you can ...
guarantee Miraz's death?

661
01:27:28.151 --> 01:27:29.985
And more.

662
01:27:42.207 --> 01:27:44.750
Let the circle be drawn.

663
01:28:55.822 --> 01:28:57.072
Wait.

664
01:29:00.785 --> 01:29:02.411
This isn't what I wanted.

665
01:29:05.081 --> 01:29:10.085
One drop of Adam's blood
and you free me.

666
01:29:10.170 --> 01:29:12.421
Then I am yours, my king.

667
01:29:13.215 --> 01:29:14.632
No!

668
01:29:36.613 --> 01:29:37.947
Stop!

669
01:30:19.155 --> 01:30:21.865
Come on! Come.

670
01:30:22.951 --> 01:30:24.410
Get away from him!

671
01:30:29.916 --> 01:30:31.333
Peter, dear.

672
01:30:32.043 --> 01:30:33.711
I've missed you.

673
01:30:36.047 --> 01:30:37.339
Come.

674
01:30:37.966 --> 01:30:39.717
Just one drop.

675
01:30:41.970 --> 01:30:44.680
You know you can't do this alone.

676
01:31:15.628 --> 01:31:18.547
I know. You had it sorted.

677
01:32:06.429 --> 01:32:09.431
Why did you never tell me
about my father?

678
01:32:12.102 --> 01:32:17.022
My mother was a Black Dwarf
from the Northern Mountains.

679
01:32:19.401 --> 01:32:21.777
I risked my life all these years

680
01:32:21.861 --> 01:32:25.531
so that one day ...

681
01:32:25.615 --> 01:32:29.618
...you might be a better king
than those before you.

682
01:32:32.288 --> 01:32:34.623
Then I have failed you.

683
01:32:38.211 --> 01:32:43.048
Everything I told you,
everything I didn't,

684
01:32:43.133 --> 01:32:47.010
it was only because I believe in you.

685
01:32:47.095 --> 01:32:53.058
You have a chance to become the most
noble contradiction in history.

686
01:32:56.312 --> 01:32:59.690
The Telmarine who saved Narnia.

687
01:33:24.507 --> 01:33:26.341
You're lucky, you know.

688
01:33:28.219 --> 01:33:30.179
What do you mean?

689
01:33:31.764 --> 01:33:33.640
To have seen him.

690
01:33:35.810 --> 01:33:40.022
I wish he'd just given me
some sort of proof.

691
01:33:42.358 --> 01:33:46.111
Maybe we're the ones who need
to prove ourselves to him.

692
01:33:51.034 --> 01:33:53.994
Pete. You'd better come quickly.

693
01:34:56.933 --> 01:35:00.602
Cakes and kettledrums.
That's your next big plan?

694
01:35:01.437 --> 01:35:06.191
Sending a little girl into the darkest
parts of the forest? Alone!

695
01:35:06.276 --> 01:35:10.237
It's our only chance.
-And she won't be alone.

696
01:35:12.282 --> 01:35:16.076
Haven't enough of us died already?

697
01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:20.581
Nikabrik was my friend too.
But he lost hope.

698
01:35:21.332 --> 01:35:24.334
Queen Lucy hasn't.
And neither have I.

699
01:35:25.461 --> 01:35:26.878
For Aslan.

700
01:35:27.463 --> 01:35:29.006
For Aslan!

701
01:35:33.970 --> 01:35:37.556
Then I'm going with you.
-No. We need you here.

702
01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:40.559
We have to hold them off
until Lucy and Susan get back.

703
01:35:41.644 --> 01:35:43.186
If I may ...

704
01:35:47.859 --> 01:35:51.987
Miraz may be a tyrant
and a murderer ...

705
01:35:53.781 --> 01:35:58.535
...but as king, he is
subject to the traditions ...

706
01:35:58.620 --> 01:36:02.456
...and expectations of his people.

707
01:36:02.540 --> 01:36:06.335
There is one in particular
that may buy us some time.

708
01:36:14.677 --> 01:36:17.304
Perhaps they intend to surrender.

709
01:36:17.388 --> 01:36:18.847
No.

710
01:36:21.434 --> 01:36:23.852
They are much too noble for that.

711
01:36:26.189 --> 01:36:30.609
"I, Peter, by the gift of Aslan,
by election and by conquest,

712
01:36:30.693 --> 01:36:35.864
High King of Narnia, Lord of Cair
Paravel and emperor of the Lone Islands,

713
01:36:35.948 --> 01:36:39.076
in order to prevent
the abominable effusion of blood,

714
01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:43.747
do hereby challenge the usurper Miraz to
single combat upon the field of battle.

715
01:36:43.831 --> 01:36:48.960
The fight shall be to the death.
The reward shall be total surrender."

716
01:36:51.964 --> 01:36:54.299
Tell me, Prince Edmund ...
-King.

717
01:36:55.385 --> 01:36:59.596
Pardon me?
-It's King Edmund, actually.

718
01:36:59.681 --> 01:37:02.349
Just "King," though.
Peter's the high king.

719
01:37:03.309 --> 01:37:05.227
I know, it's confusing.

720
01:37:07.855 --> 01:37:10.691
Why would we risk such a proposal

721
01:37:10.775 --> 01:37:14.194
when our armies could
wipe you out by nightfall?

722
01:37:15.238 --> 01:37:18.198
Haven't you already
underestimated our numbers?

723
01:37:18.866 --> 01:37:23.870
I mean, only a week ago
Narnians were extinct.

724
01:37:23.955 --> 01:37:26.164
And so you will be again.

725
01:37:26.249 --> 01:37:28.500
Well, then you should have
little to fear.

726
01:37:30.420 --> 01:37:32.504
This is not a question of bravery.

727
01:37:32.588 --> 01:37:36.258
So you're bravely refusing
to fight a swordsman half your age?

728
01:37:38.302 --> 01:37:41.471
I didn't say I refused.

729
01:37:41.556 --> 01:37:44.015
You shall have our support,
Your Majesty.

730
01:37:44.100 --> 01:37:45.851
Whatever your decision.

731
01:37:45.935 --> 01:37:50.939
Sire, our military advantage alone
provides the perfect excuse to avoid

732
01:37:51.023 --> 01:37:54.067
what might otherwise be ...
-I'm not avoiding anything!

733
01:37:55.695 --> 01:37:57.320
I was merely pointing out

734
01:37:57.405 --> 01:38:00.198
that my lord is well
within his rights to refuse.

735
01:38:00.283 --> 01:38:02.826
His Majesty would never refuse.

736
01:38:03.911 --> 01:38:06.621
He relishes the chance
to show the people

737
01:38:06.706 --> 01:38:08.957
the courage of their new king.

738
01:38:14.172 --> 01:38:15.255
You.

739
01:38:19.177 --> 01:38:23.805
You should hope your brother's sword
is sharper than his pen.

740
01:38:28.478 --> 01:38:32.898
Destrier has always served me well.
You are in good hands.

741
01:38:32.982 --> 01:38:34.649
Or hooves.

742
01:38:40.323 --> 01:38:43.533
Good luck.
-Thanks.

743
01:38:47.663 --> 01:38:49.164
Look.

744
01:38:51.292 --> 01:38:53.668
Maybe it is time you had this back.

745
01:38:56.172 --> 01:39:00.675
Why don't you hold on to it.
You might need to call me again.

746
01:39:07.683 --> 01:39:11.812
You might need to call me again?
-Oh, shut up.

747
01:39:57.942 --> 01:40:00.902
If it should appear
to be going poorly ...

748
01:40:05.741 --> 01:40:07.868
Understood, Your Majesty.

749
01:40:21.340 --> 01:40:25.552
I hope you won't be too
disappointed when I survive.

750
01:40:56.042 --> 01:40:58.627
There is still time to surrender.

751
01:41:00.963 --> 01:41:02.881
Well, feel free.

752
01:41:02.965 --> 01:41:05.467
How many more must
die for the throne?

753
01:41:06.469 --> 01:41:08.011
Just one.

754
01:41:33.496 --> 01:41:36.164
Ride!
-They've seen us!

755
01:41:51.055 --> 01:41:53.264
Take the reins.
-What are you doing?

756
01:41:53.349 --> 01:41:58.061
I'm sorry, Lucy. But it looks as if
you'll be going alone after all.

757
01:43:15.598 --> 01:43:17.599
Are you sure you
don't need that horn?

758
01:44:33.843 --> 01:44:37.428
Does His Highness need a respite?

759
01:44:37.513 --> 01:44:39.139
Five minutes?

760
01:44:40.432 --> 01:44:41.641
Three!

761
01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:02.829
Lucy?

762
01:45:02.913 --> 01:45:06.291
She got through ...
with a little help.

763
01:45:06.375 --> 01:45:09.294
Thanks.
-Well, you were busy.

764
01:45:09.378 --> 01:45:14.048
I assume you won't let things
get that close again!

765
01:45:19.263 --> 01:45:22.307
You better get up there.
Just in case.

766
01:45:22.391 --> 01:45:24.851
I don't expect the Telmarines
will keep their word.

767
01:45:29.690 --> 01:45:32.150
Sorry.
-It's all right.

768
01:45:32.234 --> 01:45:33.776
Be careful.

769
01:45:35.196 --> 01:45:36.613
Keep smiling.

770
01:45:49.251 --> 01:45:51.294
How does he look to you?

771
01:45:51.837 --> 01:45:53.296
Young.

772
01:45:56.008 --> 01:46:00.386
But His Majesty's doing
extremely well ... for his age.

773
01:46:08.729 --> 01:46:10.271
I think it's dislocated.

774
01:46:14.902 --> 01:46:18.279
What do you think happens
back home if you die here?

775
01:46:22.368 --> 01:46:25.411
You know you've always been there,
and I never really ...

776
01:46:28.582 --> 01:46:29.832
Save it for later.

777
01:48:19.109 --> 01:48:20.526
Respite!

778
01:48:24.156 --> 01:48:25.531
Respite.

779
01:48:26.325 --> 01:48:28.701
Now's not the time
for chivalry, Peter!

780
01:48:29.787 --> 01:48:31.245
Show no mercy!

781
01:48:51.308 --> 01:48:53.810
Look out!

782
01:49:19.795 --> 01:49:22.171
What's the matter, boy?

783
01:49:23.298 --> 01:49:25.466
Too cowardly to take a life?

784
01:49:29.513 --> 01:49:31.639
It's not mine to take.

785
01:50:13.932 --> 01:50:16.476
Perhaps I was wrong.

786
01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:22.023
Maybe you do have the makings
of a Telmarine king after all.

787
01:50:35.621 --> 01:50:37.705
Not one like you.

788
01:50:47.007 --> 01:50:49.926
Keep your life.

789
01:50:50.010 --> 01:50:53.513
But I am giving the Narnians
back their kingdom.

790
01:51:24.586 --> 01:51:25.836
My king.

791
01:51:29.091 --> 01:51:33.427
I'll deal with you when this is over.

792
01:51:34.263 --> 01:51:37.265
It is over.

793
01:51:51.780 --> 01:51:56.033
Treachery! They shot him!

794
01:51:56.118 --> 01:51:58.536
They murdered our king!

795
01:51:59.371 --> 01:52:01.372
Be ready!

796
01:52:03.166 --> 01:52:04.333
Peter!

797
01:52:10.966 --> 01:52:12.717
Go!

798
01:52:19.891 --> 01:52:23.060
To arms, Telmar!

799
01:52:23.145 --> 01:52:24.937
To arms!

800
01:52:29.109 --> 01:52:30.109
Loose!

801
01:52:55.677 --> 01:52:57.136
Cavalry!

802
01:52:59.056 --> 01:53:02.892
Attack!

803
01:53:19.368 --> 01:53:21.702
Archers to the ready!

804
01:53:45.477 --> 01:53:47.228
Narnians!

805
01:53:47.312 --> 01:53:50.564
Charge!

806
01:54:11.878 --> 01:54:15.005
One, two ...

807
01:54:15.090 --> 01:54:17.550
Three, four ...

808
01:54:17.634 --> 01:54:20.469
Five, six ...

809
01:54:22.848 --> 01:54:24.265
Take your aim!

810
01:54:26.017 --> 01:54:27.435
Stay with them!

811
01:54:29.688 --> 01:54:32.857
Eight, nine ...

812
01:54:32.941 --> 01:54:34.984
Get ready!

813
01:54:36.611 --> 01:54:38.279
Now!

814
01:55:00.469 --> 01:55:03.304
Stop! Back! Back!

815
01:55:04.890 --> 01:55:07.558
Hold it now! Hold it!

816
01:55:10.729 --> 01:55:11.771
Now!

817
01:55:27.496 --> 01:55:30.286
Charge!

818
01:55:43.087 --> 01:55:44.887
Charge!

819
01:56:11.498 --> 01:56:13.165
You're a mouse.

820
01:56:13.250 --> 01:56:15.626
You people have no imagination.

821
01:56:44.406 --> 01:56:46.156
Move it!

822
01:56:46.241 --> 01:56:48.075
Loose! Loose!

823
01:56:56.126 --> 01:56:57.710
Lucy?

824
01:57:06.595 --> 01:57:08.137
Back to the How!

825
01:57:13.435 --> 01:57:14.894
Cut off their escape!

826
01:57:14.978 --> 01:57:16.207
Loose!

827
01:57:18.508 --> 01:57:20.008
Loose!

828
01:57:27.282 --> 01:57:30.659
Brace yourselves!

829
01:58:21.336 --> 01:58:23.003
Crush them all.

830
01:59:33.867 --> 01:59:34.908
Aslan!

831
01:59:44.419 --> 01:59:47.796
I knew it was you.
The whole time, I knew it.

832
01:59:47.881 --> 01:59:50.090
But the others didn't believe me.

833
01:59:50.175 --> 01:59:52.634
And why would that stop you
from coming to me?

834
01:59:55.472 --> 01:59:58.348
I'm sorry. I was too scared
to come alone.

835
02:00:00.268 --> 02:00:02.311
Why wouldn't you show yourself?

836
02:00:02.395 --> 02:00:05.606
Why couldn't you come roaring in
and save us like last time?

837
02:00:05.690 --> 02:00:09.276
Things never happen
the same way twice, dear one.

838
02:00:14.282 --> 02:00:19.453
If I'd have come earlier, would everyone
who died ... could I have stopped that?

839
02:00:21.456 --> 02:00:24.541
We can never know
what would have happened, Lucy.

840
02:00:24.626 --> 02:00:28.879
But what will happen
is another matter entirely.

841
02:00:28.963 --> 02:00:31.423
You mean you'll help?
-Of course.

842
02:00:31.508 --> 02:00:35.135
As will you.
-Oh, I wish I was braver.

843
02:00:35.220 --> 02:00:38.097
If you were any braver,
you'd be a lioness.

844
02:00:38.181 --> 02:00:43.227
Now, I think your friends
have slept long enough, don't you?

845
02:01:15.176 --> 02:01:17.261
Come on!

846
02:02:21.034 --> 02:02:22.367
Lucy.

847
02:02:48.686 --> 02:02:51.021
For Aslan!

848
02:02:56.444 --> 02:02:59.321
We can defeat them
if we draw them to the river.

849
02:02:59.405 --> 02:03:02.366
We must regroup. To Beruna!

850
02:03:02.450 --> 02:03:04.493
To the bridge!

851
02:04:02.427 --> 02:04:04.177
Charge!

852
02:04:32.248 --> 02:04:35.125
What is happening?

853
02:04:35.209 --> 02:04:38.170
The river!
-Retreat!

854
02:04:38.254 --> 02:04:40.255
Back! Back!

855
02:05:42.360 --> 02:05:43.944
Come on.

856
02:06:12.557 --> 02:06:14.975
Assemble on that bank!

857
02:06:16.227 --> 02:06:18.478
You will not be harmed!

858
02:06:20.148 --> 02:06:22.482
Surrender your weapons!

859
02:06:23.317 --> 02:06:25.652
Take off the armor!

860
02:06:42.670 --> 02:06:46.256
Rise, kings and queens of Narnia.

861
02:06:49.844 --> 02:06:51.178
All of you.

862
02:06:56.767 --> 02:06:58.685
I do not think I am ready.

863
02:06:58.769 --> 02:07:02.063
It's for that very reason
I know you are.

864
02:07:50.404 --> 02:07:53.156
Thank you, Your Majesty.

865
02:07:53.241 --> 02:07:55.408
Thank you.

866
02:07:57.453 --> 02:08:02.415
Hail, Aslan!
It is a great honor to be in ...

867
02:08:06.420 --> 02:08:09.089
I'm completely out of countenance.

868
02:08:09.173 --> 02:08:13.051
I must crave your indulgence for
appearing in this unseemly fashion.

869
02:08:14.929 --> 02:08:16.972
Perhaps a drop more?

870
02:08:17.056 --> 02:08:20.100
I don't think it does that.
-You could have a go.

871
02:08:21.477 --> 02:08:23.186
It becomes you well, small one.

872
02:08:23.271 --> 02:08:26.106
All the same, great king,

873
02:08:26.190 --> 02:08:31.653
I regret that I must withdraw, for a
tail is the honor and glory of a mouse.

874
02:08:31.737 --> 02:08:35.198
Perhaps you think too much
of your honor, friend.

875
02:08:35.283 --> 02:08:40.161
Well' it's not just the honor.
It's also great for balance.

876
02:08:40.246 --> 02:08:43.790
And climbing.
And grabbing things.

877
02:08:43.874 --> 02:08:47.210
May it please Your High Majesty,
we will not bear the shame

878
02:08:47.295 --> 02:08:50.297
of wearing an honor
denied to our chief.

879
02:08:50.381 --> 02:08:53.300
Not for the sake of your dignity,

880
02:08:53.884 --> 02:08:56.136
but for the love of your people.

881
02:09:02.143 --> 02:09:06.646
Look! Thank you, my liege.
I will treasure it always.

882
02:09:06.731 --> 02:09:11.484
From this day forward it will serve
as a great reminder of my huge humility.

883
02:09:13.487 --> 02:09:17.574
Now, where is this dear little
friend you've told me so much about?

884
02:09:37.720 --> 02:09:39.846
Do you see him now?

885
02:10:44.745 --> 02:10:47.664
Because you have snuck in ...

886
02:10:47.748 --> 02:10:50.875
I'm sorry, but their future
in that world shall be good.

887
02:10:51.836 --> 02:10:53.920
Your Majesty?

888
02:11:03.597 --> 02:11:07.058
We are ready.
Everyone has assembled.

889
02:11:16.402 --> 02:11:20.780
Narnia belongs to the Narnians,
just as it does to man.

890
02:11:20.865 --> 02:11:25.118
Any Telmarines who want to stay
and live in peace are welcome to.

891
02:11:25.202 --> 02:11:27.537
But for any of you who wish,

892
02:11:27.621 --> 02:11:31.249
Aslan will return you
to the home of our forefathers.

893
02:11:31.333 --> 02:11:34.377
It's been generations
since we left Telmar.

894
02:11:34.462 --> 02:11:36.838
We're not referring to Telmar.

895
02:11:36.922 --> 02:11:39.591
Your ancestors were
seafaring brigands.

896
02:11:39.675 --> 02:11:42.385
Pirates run aground on an island.

897
02:11:42.470 --> 02:11:47.557
There they found a cave, a rare chasm
that brought them here from their world.

898
02:11:47.641 --> 02:11:50.435
The same world as our
kings and queens.

899
02:11:52.980 --> 02:11:55.398
It is to that island
I can return you.

900
02:11:55.483 --> 02:11:59.486
It is a good place for any
who wish to make a new start.

901
02:12:01.614 --> 02:12:02.739
I will go.

902
02:12:05.034 --> 02:12:06.659
I will accept the offer.

903
02:12:14.502 --> 02:12:16.169
So will we.

904
02:12:20.508 --> 02:12:26.346
Because you have spoken first,
your future in that world shall be good.

905
02:13:09.098 --> 02:13:11.224
Where did they go?
-They killed them.

906
02:13:11.308 --> 02:13:15.019
How do we know he is not
leading us to our death?

907
02:13:15.104 --> 02:13:18.648
Sire. If my example
can be of any service,

908
02:13:18.732 --> 02:13:21.568
I will take 11 mice through
with no delay.

909
02:13:28.659 --> 02:13:32.579
We'll go.
-We will?

910
02:13:32.663 --> 02:13:35.874
Come on. Our time's up.

911
02:13:37.334 --> 02:13:39.252
After all ...

912
02:13:40.671 --> 02:13:43.256
...we're not really
needed here anymore.

913
02:13:47.678 --> 02:13:50.138
I will look after it
until you return.

914
02:13:50.222 --> 02:13:52.265
I'm afraid that's just it.

915
02:13:54.268 --> 02:13:56.019
We're not coming back.

916
02:13:59.189 --> 02:14:00.189
We're not?

917
02:14:01.066 --> 02:14:02.358
You two are.

918
02:14:03.611 --> 02:14:07.280
At least,
I think he means you two.

919
02:14:08.198 --> 02:14:10.158
But why?

920
02:14:10.242 --> 02:14:13.494
Did they do something wrong?
-Quite the opposite, dear one.

921
02:14:13.579 --> 02:14:15.538
But all things have their time.

922
02:14:15.623 --> 02:14:19.042
Your brother and sister have learned
what they can from this world.

923
02:14:19.126 --> 02:14:21.794
Now it's time for them
to live in their own.

924
02:14:23.839 --> 02:14:25.798
It's all right, Lu.

925
02:14:27.301 --> 02:14:30.178
It's not how I thought
it would be ...

926
02:14:30.262 --> 02:14:32.639
...but it's all right.

927
02:14:32.723 --> 02:14:36.434
One day you'll see, too.
Come on.

928
02:15:10.678 --> 02:15:12.720
I'm glad I came back.

929
02:15:14.139 --> 02:15:16.182
I wish we had more time together.

930
02:15:18.686 --> 02:15:21.020
It would never have worked, anyway.

931
02:15:21.105 --> 02:15:22.772
Why not?

932
02:15:22.856 --> 02:15:25.525
I am 1,300 years older than you.

933
02:15:46.046 --> 02:15:49.215
I'm sure when I'm
older I'll understand.

934
02:15:50.259 --> 02:15:53.219
I'm older and don't think
I want to understand.

935
02:17:10.798 --> 02:17:13.299
Aren't you coming, Phyllis?

936
02:17:23.602 --> 02:17:26.395
You don't think there's
any way we can get back?

937
02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.296
I've left my new torch in Narnia.
