WEBVTT

1
00:02:22.768 --> 00:02:24.687
(speaking German)

2
00:02:26.021 --> 00:02:28.399
(German)

3
00:02:37.241 --> 00:02:40.244
(German continues)

4
00:03:03.267 --> 00:03:06.896
(German continues)

5
00:03:26.457 --> 00:03:29.335
(German continues)

6
00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:48.520
(both arguing)

7
00:03:55.444 --> 00:03:57.446
(door opens)

8
00:03:57.529 --> 00:03:59.239
(door closes)

9
00:04:02.743 --> 00:04:04.912
Do you have any idea
what they were arguing about?

10
00:04:06.997 --> 00:04:08.499
D-Do you speak English?

11
00:04:08.582 --> 00:04:12.544
(French accent) Yeah. No, I'm sorry.
My German is not very good.

12
00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:21.345
Have you heard that as couples get older,
they lose their ability to hear each other?

13
00:04:22.304 --> 00:04:23.973
No.

14
00:04:24.056 --> 00:04:28.185
Well, supposedly, men lose their ability
to hear higher-pitched sounds.

15
00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:31.230
And women eventually
lose hearing on the low end.

16
00:04:31.313 --> 00:04:34.191
- I guess they sort of nullify each other.
- I guess.

17
00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:37.987
Nature's way of allowing couples to grow
old together without killing each other.

18
00:04:40.656 --> 00:04:42.282
What are you reading?

19
00:04:43.158 --> 00:04:44.535
Ah, yeah.

20
00:04:45.536 --> 00:04:48.122
- How about you?
- Um...

21
00:04:48.747 --> 00:04:51.291
- Mmm. (chuckles)
- Hmm.

22
00:04:57.673 --> 00:05:00.634
(man, woman speaking German)

23
00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:07.349
Look, I was thinking about going
to the lounge car sometime soon.

24
00:05:07.433 --> 00:05:10.019
- Would you like to come with me?
- Yeah.

25
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.938
Okay.

26
00:05:32.207 --> 00:05:34.460
So how do you speak such good English?

27
00:05:34.543 --> 00:05:37.212
I went to school
for a summer in Los Angeles.

28
00:05:37.296 --> 00:05:38.756
- Yeah?
- It's fine here?

29
00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:40.549
Yeah, this is good.

30
00:05:40.632 --> 00:05:42.760
Then I spent some time in London.

31
00:05:43.635 --> 00:05:45.054
Uh, well...

32
00:05:45.137 --> 00:05:47.347
How do you speak such good English?

33
00:05:47.431 --> 00:05:49.141
Me? I'm American.

34
00:05:49.224 --> 00:05:50.350
- You're American?
- Yeah.

35
00:05:50.434 --> 00:05:52.227
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

36
00:05:52.311 --> 00:05:55.272
(laughing) No, I'm joking.

37
00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:59.276
I knew you were American. And of course,
you don't speak any other language, right?

38
00:05:59.985 --> 00:06:01.987
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it, I get it.

39
00:06:02.071 --> 00:06:04.281
So I'm the crude, dumb, vulgar American

40
00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:07.201
who doesn't speak any other languages,
who has no culture, right?

41
00:06:07.284 --> 00:06:09.244
But I tried.

42
00:06:09.328 --> 00:06:11.455
I took French for four years
in high school.

43
00:06:11.538 --> 00:06:15.834
When I first got to Paris,
I stood in line at the Metro station,

44
00:06:15.918 --> 00:06:18.462
I was practicing ―
<i>Une billet' s'il vous plaît.</i>

45
00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:20.839
<i>- Une billet' s'il vous plaît.
- Un billet.</i>

46
00:06:20.923 --> 00:06:23.425
<i>Un'</i> whatever ― <i>Un ― Un ―</i>

47
00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:26.261
<i>Un billet' s'il vous plait.
Un billet' s'il vous plait.</i>

48
00:06:26.345 --> 00:06:30.891
And I get up there and I look at this woman
and my mind goes completely blank.

49
00:06:30.974 --> 00:06:34.520
And I start saying , "Ah, listen, I need
a ticket to get to, um ―" You know.

50
00:06:34.603 --> 00:06:37.272
So, anyway. Um ―

51
00:06:37.356 --> 00:06:39.399
So where are you headed?

52
00:06:39.483 --> 00:06:43.570
Well, back to Paris.
My classes start next week.

53
00:06:43.654 --> 00:06:47.491
- You're still in school? Where do you go?
- Yeah. La Sorbonne, you know?

54
00:06:47.574 --> 00:06:49.201
Sure.

55
00:06:50.702 --> 00:06:54.123
- Are you coming from Budapest?
- Yeah, I was visiting my grandmother.

56
00:06:54.206 --> 00:06:55.499
Ah. How is she?

57
00:06:55.582 --> 00:06:58.377
(laughing) She ― She's okay.

58
00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.546
- She's all right?
- She's fine, yeah.

59
00:07:01.713 --> 00:07:05.050
- How about you? Where are you going?
- I'm going to Vienna.

60
00:07:05.134 --> 00:07:08.595
- Vienna? What's there?
- I have no idea. I'm flying out of there tomorrow.

61
00:07:08.679 --> 00:07:10.722
- Ah. You're on holiday?
- Uh...

62
00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:17.146
- Uh, I don't really know what I'm on.
- Okay.

63
00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:21.024
I'm just traveling around. I've been riding
the trains the past two, three weeks.

64
00:07:21.108 --> 00:07:24.653
Mm-hmm. You were visiting friends
or just on your own?

65
00:07:24.736 --> 00:07:28.407
- Yeah. I had a friend in Madrid , but, um ―
- Madrid? That's nice.

66
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.660
Yeah, I got one of those
Eurail passes, is what I did.

67
00:07:31.743 --> 00:07:33.245
That's great.

68
00:07:33.328 --> 00:07:37.666
So, has this trip around Europe
been good for you?

69
00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:40.627
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, it's been, um ― It sucked.

70
00:07:40.711 --> 00:07:42.379
- You know?
- What?

71
00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:44.506
-(laughing) No, it's ― It isn't ―
-(laughing)

72
00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:47.134
It's had its, um ― Well, I'll tell you.

73
00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:49.761
Sitting , you know, for weeks on end ,
looking out the window

74
00:07:49.845 --> 00:07:51.930
has actually been kinda great.

75
00:07:53.307 --> 00:07:54.975
What do you mean?

76
00:07:55.976 --> 00:07:58.061
Well, uh, you know, for inst ―

77
00:07:58.145 --> 00:08:00.856
You have ideas
that you ordinarily wouldn't have.

78
00:08:01.773 --> 00:08:03.442
- What kind of ideas?
- You wanna hear one?

79
00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:05.277
- Yeah, tell me.
- All right.

80
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.405
- Uh, I have this idea, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

81
00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:12.034
For a television show. Some friends of mine
are these cable access producers.

82
00:08:12.117 --> 00:08:14.453
Do you know what that is, cable acc...

83
00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:19.249
Anybody can produce a show real cheap,
and they have to put it on. Right?

84
00:08:19.333 --> 00:08:23.587
I have this idea for this show that would last
24 hours a day, for a year straight, right?

85
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:27.299
What you do is you get 365 people

86
00:08:27.382 --> 00:08:29.593
from cities all over the world

87
00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:32.596
to do these 24-hour documents of real time,

88
00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:35.599
capturing life as it's lived.

89
00:08:35.682 --> 00:08:38.977
You know, it would start
with a guy waking up in the morning

90
00:08:39.061 --> 00:08:41.313
and , uh, you know, taking a long shower,

91
00:08:41.396 --> 00:08:44.608
um , eating a little breakfast,
making a little coffee,

92
00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:47.110
you know, and , uh, reading the paper.

93
00:08:47.194 --> 00:08:49.529
Wait, wait, all those mundane, boring things

94
00:08:49.613 --> 00:08:52.950
everybody has to do
every day of their fucking life?

95
00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:54.952
I was gonna say
"the poetry of day-to-day life."

96
00:08:55.035 --> 00:08:57.955
But you say it the way you say it,
I'll say it the way I say it.

97
00:08:58.038 --> 00:09:00.958
- Who's gonna want to watch this?
- But think about it like this ―

98
00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:05.295
Why is it that a dog
sleeping in the sun is so beautiful?

99
00:09:05.379 --> 00:09:07.089
You know? It is. It's beautiful.

100
00:09:07.172 --> 00:09:09.967
But a guy standing at a bank machine,
trying to take some money out,

101
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.261
looks like a complete moron.

102
00:09:12.344 --> 00:09:16.598
So it's like a <i>National Geographic</i> program ,
but on people.

103
00:09:16.682 --> 00:09:18.517
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

104
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.520
- What do you think?
- I can ― I can see it ―

105
00:09:21.603 --> 00:09:23.855
Like 24 boring hours. Sorry.

106
00:09:23.939 --> 00:09:27.276
And , like, a three-minute sex scene
where he falls asleep right after, no?

107
00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:29.778
Yeah! You know ―

108
00:09:29.861 --> 00:09:31.571
- I mean, that would be a great episode.
- Yeah.

109
00:09:31.655 --> 00:09:34.616
- People would talk about that episode.
-(laughing)

110
00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.952
You and your friends
could do one in Paris if you wanted to.

111
00:09:37.035 --> 00:09:38.829
Oh, sure.

112
00:09:38.912 --> 00:09:43.792
The key ― The thing that kinda
haunts me is, uh ― is the distribution.

113
00:09:43.875 --> 00:09:47.587
Getting these tapes from town to town,
city to city, so that it would play continuously.

114
00:09:47.671 --> 00:09:51.967
'Cause it'd have to play all the time
or else it just wouldn't work.

115
00:09:52.968 --> 00:09:54.636
Thank you.

116
00:09:55.846 --> 00:09:57.514
Thanks.

117
00:09:58.765 --> 00:10:01.435
You know what?
They're not service-oriented.

118
00:10:01.518 --> 00:10:02.853
(chuckles)

119
00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:05.564
Just an observation about Europe.

120
00:10:13.363 --> 00:10:17.826
My parents have never really spoken
of the possibility of my falling in love

121
00:10:17.909 --> 00:10:21.079
or getting married or having children.

122
00:10:21.163 --> 00:10:23.165
Even as a little girl,

123
00:10:23.248 --> 00:10:27.919
they wanted me to think as a future career
as a, you know, interior designer

124
00:10:28.003 --> 00:10:30.213
or lawyer or something like that.

125
00:10:30.297 --> 00:10:35.093
I'd say to my Dad , "I want to be a writer,"
and he'd say, "Journalist."

126
00:10:35.177 --> 00:10:39.890
I'd say I wanted to have a refuge for stray cats
and he'd say, "Veterinarian."

127
00:10:39.973 --> 00:10:42.726
I'd say I wanted to be an actress
and he'd say, "TV newscaster."

128
00:10:43.894 --> 00:10:46.980
It was this constant conversion
of my fanciful ambition

129
00:10:47.064 --> 00:10:50.275
into these practical,
moneymaking ventures.

130
00:10:50.359 --> 00:10:51.943
Mmm.

131
00:10:52.027 --> 00:10:55.322
I always had a pretty good
bullshit detector when I was a kid.

132
00:10:55.405 --> 00:10:57.783
I always knew when they were
lying to me, you know?

133
00:10:57.866 --> 00:10:59.576
By the time I was in high school,

134
00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:03.205
I was dead set on listening to what
everybody thought I should be doing with my life

135
00:11:03.288 --> 00:11:06.083
and just kinda... doing the opposite.

136
00:11:07.501 --> 00:11:09.252
Nobody was ever mean about it.

137
00:11:09.336 --> 00:11:14.716
It's just I could never get very excited
about other people's ambitions for my life.

138
00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.135
Hmm. But you know what?

139
00:11:17.219 --> 00:11:20.555
If your parents never really
fully contradict you about anything

140
00:11:20.639 --> 00:11:23.642
-and are basically nice and supportive ―
- Right.

141
00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:27.354
It makes it even harder
to officially complain.

142
00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:29.106
You know, even when they're wrong.

143
00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:33.235
It's this passive-aggressive shit.
You know what I mean? It's...

144
00:11:33.318 --> 00:11:34.569
I hate it.

145
00:11:34.653 --> 00:11:36.655
- I really hate it.
-(chuckling)

146
00:11:36.738 --> 00:11:42.661
Well, you know, despite all that kind
of bullshit that comes along with it,

147
00:11:42.744 --> 00:11:45.747
I remember childhood as this...

148
00:11:46.581 --> 00:11:48.542
you know, this magical time.

149
00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:49.876
I do.

150
00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:53.839
I remember when, uh, my mother
first told me about death.

151
00:11:53.922 --> 00:11:56.133
My great-grandmother had just died ,

152
00:11:56.216 --> 00:11:58.718
and my whole family
had just visited them in Florida.

153
00:11:58.802 --> 00:12:00.887
I was about three,
three and a half years old.

154
00:12:01.638 --> 00:12:04.683
Anyway, I was in the backyard , playing ,

155
00:12:04.766 --> 00:12:06.768
and my sister had just taught me

156
00:12:06.852 --> 00:12:10.730
how to take the garden hose
and do it in such a way that,

157
00:12:10.814 --> 00:12:13.900
uh, it sprayed into the sun
and it would make a rainbow.

158
00:12:13.984 --> 00:12:15.986
Right?

159
00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:18.029
So I was doing that,

160
00:12:18.113 --> 00:12:21.116
and through the mist,
I could see my grandmother.

161
00:12:21.199 --> 00:12:25.078
You know? And she was
just standing there, smiling at me.

162
00:12:25.162 --> 00:12:28.498
And , uh, I held it there for a long time

163
00:12:28.582 --> 00:12:33.545
and I looked at her,
and then finally I-I let go of the nozzle.

164
00:12:33.628 --> 00:12:36.214
You know? And then I dropped the hose.

165
00:12:36.298 --> 00:12:38.091
And she disappeared.

166
00:12:38.175 --> 00:12:41.428
So I run back inside
and I tell my parents.

167
00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:45.474
And they, uh, sit me down
and give me this big rap

168
00:12:45.557 --> 00:12:50.687
on how, when people die, you never
see them again and how I'd imagined it.

169
00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.772
But I knew what I'd seen.

170
00:12:52.856 --> 00:12:55.817
I was just glad that I saw it.
I've never seen anything like that since.

171
00:12:55.901 --> 00:12:58.320
But I don't know.

172
00:12:58.403 --> 00:13:02.574
It just kinda let me know
how ambiguous everything was.

173
00:13:02.657 --> 00:13:04.242
You know? Even death.

174
00:13:05.702 --> 00:13:08.622
You're really lucky you can
have this attitude toward death.

175
00:13:10.999 --> 00:13:13.919
I think I'm afraid of death
24 hours a day.

176
00:13:14.002 --> 00:13:16.129
I swear.

177
00:13:16.213 --> 00:13:19.925
That's why I'm in a train right now.
I could have flown to Paris, but I'm too scared.

178
00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:22.844
- Oh, come on.
- I can't help it. I can't help it.

179
00:13:22.928 --> 00:13:26.473
I know the statistics say "na na na,"
it's safer. Whatever.

180
00:13:26.556 --> 00:13:29.976
When I'm in a plane, I can see it.
I can see the explosion.

181
00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.479
- I can see me falling through the clouds.
-(imitates explosion)

182
00:13:32.562 --> 00:13:37.901
And I'm so scared of those few seconds
of consciousness before you're gonna die.

183
00:13:37.984 --> 00:13:40.320
You know, when you know
for sure you're gonna die?

184
00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.450
I can't stop thinking that way.

185
00:13:45.534 --> 00:13:48.286
- It's ― It's exhausting.
- Yeah, I bet.

186
00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:50.497
(laughs) Really exhausting.

187
00:13:54.751 --> 00:13:57.379
- I think this is Vienna.
- Yeah.

188
00:13:58.547 --> 00:14:01.758
- You get off here, no?
- Yeah. What a drag.

189
00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:05.095
I wish I had met you earlier.
I really like talking to you.

190
00:14:06.596 --> 00:14:08.515
Yeah, me too. (laughs)

191
00:14:08.598 --> 00:14:10.892
It was really nice talking to you.

192
00:14:33.582 --> 00:14:35.375
(man on PA speaking German)

193
00:14:41.965 --> 00:14:45.010
I have an admittedly insane idea,
but if I don't ask you this,

194
00:14:45.093 --> 00:14:47.095
it's gonna haunt me the rest of my life.

195
00:14:47.178 --> 00:14:48.972
What?

196
00:14:50.557 --> 00:14:55.645
Um... I want to keep talking to you.
I have no idea what your situation is.

197
00:14:55.729 --> 00:15:01.693
But, uh... But I feel like we have
some kind of a connection, right?

198
00:15:01.776 --> 00:15:04.404
- Yeah, me too.
- Yeah, right. Well, great.

199
00:15:04.487 --> 00:15:08.867
So you should get off the train with me here
in Vienna and come check out the town.

200
00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:11.578
- What?
- Come on. It'll be fun. Come on.

201
00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:13.622
- What would we do?
- I don't know.

202
00:15:13.705 --> 00:15:17.626
All I know is I have to catch an Austrian
Airlines flight tomorrow morning at 9:30,

203
00:15:17.709 --> 00:15:20.754
and I don't have enough money for a hotel,
so I was just gonna walk around ,

204
00:15:20.837 --> 00:15:23.214
and it'd be a lot more fun
if you came with me.

205
00:15:23.298 --> 00:15:27.594
And if I turn out to be some kind of psycho,
you just get on the next train.

206
00:15:27.677 --> 00:15:30.180
All right, think of it like this. Um...

207
00:15:31.681 --> 00:15:36.311
Uh, jump ahead ten, 20 years.
Okay? And you're married.

208
00:15:36.394 --> 00:15:40.065
Only your marriage doesn't have
that same energy that it used to have.

209
00:15:40.148 --> 00:15:42.442
You start to blame your husband.

210
00:15:42.525 --> 00:15:45.945
You start to think about all those guys
you've met in your life

211
00:15:46.029 --> 00:15:49.366
and what might have happened
if you picked up with one of them , right?

212
00:15:49.449 --> 00:15:51.618
Well, I'm one of those guys. That's me.

213
00:15:51.701 --> 00:15:54.663
So think of this as time travel
from then to now,

214
00:15:54.746 --> 00:15:57.457
to find out what you're missing out on.

215
00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:02.295
See, what this really could be is a gigantic
favor to both you and your future husband

216
00:16:02.379 --> 00:16:04.422
to find out that you're not
missing out on anything.

217
00:16:04.506 --> 00:16:07.258
I'm just as big a loser as he is,
totally unmotivated , totally boring ,

218
00:16:07.342 --> 00:16:10.053
and , uh, you made the right choice
and you're really happy.

219
00:16:12.597 --> 00:16:15.350
- I...
-(mouthing words)

220
00:16:16.476 --> 00:16:19.646
- Let me get my bag.
- Yeah.

221
00:16:25.902 --> 00:16:27.654
(giggles)

222
00:16:44.879 --> 00:16:47.924
- We should get a locker for all this stuff.
- Okay.

223
00:16:48.007 --> 00:16:50.301
(PA announcer speaking German)

224
00:16:52.262 --> 00:16:56.057
- What's your name?
- My name? Uh, it's Jesse.

225
00:16:56.141 --> 00:16:58.643
It's James, actually,
but everybody always calls me Jesse.

226
00:16:58.727 --> 00:17:02.063
- You mean Jesse James?
- No, no, just Jesse.

227
00:17:02.147 --> 00:17:03.606
I'm Celine.

228
00:17:17.996 --> 00:17:20.498
- This is a nice bridge.
- Yeah.

229
00:17:25.587 --> 00:17:27.922
- This is kinda weird.
- Yeah, it's kinda weird , isn't it?

230
00:17:28.006 --> 00:17:31.259
I mean, it's a little awkward. (laughs)

231
00:17:31.342 --> 00:17:35.180
- But it's all right, right?
- Yeah, this is great. Let's go to some places.

232
00:17:35.263 --> 00:17:37.515
- Look at your book.
- We're in Vienna. Let's go to some places.

233
00:17:37.599 --> 00:17:39.934
- Look, let's ask these guys.
- Okay.

234
00:17:40.018 --> 00:17:42.437
Uh, excuse me. Excuse me.

235
00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.690
<i>- Sprechen sie</i> English?
<i>- Ja.</i> Of course.

236
00:17:45.774 --> 00:17:48.276
- Could you speak German for a change?
- What?

237
00:17:48.359 --> 00:17:49.986
No, it was a joke.

238
00:17:50.069 --> 00:17:54.115
Well, listen, we just got into Vienna today
and we're looking for something fun to do.

239
00:17:54.199 --> 00:17:55.950
Like museums, exhibitions.

240
00:17:56.034 --> 00:17:59.162
But museums are not that funny
anymore these days.

241
00:17:59.245 --> 00:18:02.207
Uh, and they are closing right now.

242
00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:05.460
- How long are you going to be here?
- Just for tonight.

243
00:18:05.543 --> 00:18:08.797
Why did you come to Vienna?
What could you be expecting?

244
00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.965
Um...

245
00:18:11.049 --> 00:18:12.634
We're on honeymoon.

246
00:18:13.843 --> 00:18:16.596
Yeah. She got pregnant.
We had to get married.

247
00:18:16.679 --> 00:18:19.557
- No, I don't believe you. You're a bad liar.
-(laughing)

248
00:18:19.641 --> 00:18:21.559
Um... (laughs)

249
00:18:21.643 --> 00:18:24.395
(speaking German)

250
00:18:24.479 --> 00:18:27.982
This is, uh ― This is a play we're both in.

251
00:18:28.066 --> 00:18:30.360
- And we would like to invite you.
- You're actors?

252
00:18:30.443 --> 00:18:32.821
Not professional actors.
Part-time actors for fun.

253
00:18:32.904 --> 00:18:36.241
It's a play about a cow
and the Indians searching for it.

254
00:18:36.324 --> 00:18:40.995
- There are also politicians, Mexicans, Russians.
- Communists.

255
00:18:41.079 --> 00:18:43.581
- You have a real cow on stage?
- No, not a real cow.

256
00:18:43.665 --> 00:18:46.209
- It's an actor in a cow costume.
- And he is the cow.

257
00:18:46.292 --> 00:18:49.379
Yes, I am the cow,
and the cow is a bit weird.

258
00:18:49.462 --> 00:18:53.216
- The cow has a disease.
- She's acting a bit strange, like a dog.

259
00:18:53.299 --> 00:18:56.135
If someone throws a stick,
she fetches it and brings it back.

260
00:18:56.219 --> 00:18:59.472
And she can smoke
with hooves and everything.

261
00:18:59.556 --> 00:19:02.559
- Great.
- And as you see, there's the address.

262
00:19:02.642 --> 00:19:06.271
- It's in the second district.
- Near the Prater. You know the Prater?

263
00:19:06.354 --> 00:19:10.608
- Ah, the big Ferris wheel. We should do it.
- Everybody knows the wheel.

264
00:19:10.692 --> 00:19:15.613
Perhaps you can go to the Prater
before the play. It starts at 21:30.

265
00:19:15.697 --> 00:19:17.699
-21:30?
- It's 9:30.

266
00:19:17.782 --> 00:19:20.076
Oh, 9:30. Right, right.

267
00:19:20.159 --> 00:19:22.704
Okay, great. What's the name of this play?

268
00:19:22.787 --> 00:19:26.291
It translates as <i>Bring Me The Horns</i>
<i>of Wilmington's Cow.</i>

269
00:19:26.374 --> 00:19:29.419
- I'm Wilmington's cow.
- All right.

270
00:19:29.502 --> 00:19:31.337
- Will you be there?
- We'll try.

271
00:19:31.421 --> 00:19:33.339
- I'm the cow.
- You're the ― (chuckles)

272
00:19:33.423 --> 00:19:35.049
Good-bye.

273
00:19:38.845 --> 00:19:41.264
(bell tolling)

274
00:19:54.736 --> 00:19:57.238
- I got an idea. Are you ready?
- Yeah.

275
00:19:57.322 --> 00:19:59.949
It's Q & A time.
We've known each other a little while now.

276
00:20:00.033 --> 00:20:04.203
We're stuck together, so we're gonna
ask each other a few direct questions.

277
00:20:04.287 --> 00:20:07.290
- All right?
- So we ask each other questions.

278
00:20:07.373 --> 00:20:10.835
- And you have to answer 100% honestly.
- Of course.

279
00:20:10.919 --> 00:20:13.963
- Okay. All right, first question.
- You.

280
00:20:14.047 --> 00:20:16.299
(German accent) Describe for me ―
Yes, I'm going to ask you.

281
00:20:16.382 --> 00:20:22.013
Describe for me your first
sexual feelings towards a person.

282
00:20:23.139 --> 00:20:25.475
My first sexual feelings. Oh, my God.

283
00:20:25.558 --> 00:20:27.060
Um...

284
00:20:27.727 --> 00:20:29.562
I know, I know.

285
00:20:29.646 --> 00:20:32.106
Jean-Marc Fleury. (giggles)

286
00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:34.108
Jean-Marc Fleury?

287
00:20:34.192 --> 00:20:37.153
We were at this summer camp together,
and he was a swimmer.

288
00:20:37.236 --> 00:20:38.571
Yeah.

289
00:20:38.655 --> 00:20:41.699
He had bleached-out chlorine hair
and green eyes.

290
00:20:41.783 --> 00:20:45.286
And to improve his times,
he'd shave the hair off his legs and arms.

291
00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:48.873
- That's disgusting.
- Oh, no. He was like this gorgeous dolphin.

292
00:20:48.957 --> 00:20:51.376
And my friend Emma
had a big , big crush on him.

293
00:20:51.459 --> 00:20:54.754
So one day I was cutting across the field
back to my room

294
00:20:54.837 --> 00:20:56.756
and he came walking up beside me.

295
00:20:56.839 --> 00:21:01.469
And I told him , "You should date Emma
because she has a big crush on you."

296
00:21:01.552 --> 00:21:04.806
And he turned to me and said ,
"Well, that's too bad ,

297
00:21:04.889 --> 00:21:07.433
because I have a big crush on you."

298
00:21:07.517 --> 00:21:12.939
So ― Yeah. It scared the hell out of me
because I thought he was so fine.

299
00:21:13.022 --> 00:21:15.566
And then he officially
asked me out on a date.

300
00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:18.069
You know, I pretended I didn't like him.

301
00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:23.282
You know, I was so afraid
of what I might do.

302
00:21:23.366 --> 00:21:25.284
Uh... Well...

303
00:21:25.368 --> 00:21:28.955
I went to see him swim a few times
at the swimming competition.

304
00:21:29.038 --> 00:21:32.125
He was so sexy, really.
I mean really sexy.

305
00:21:32.208 --> 00:21:35.503
You know, we kind of wrote these
little declarations of love to each other

306
00:21:35.586 --> 00:21:37.255
at the end of the summer

307
00:21:37.338 --> 00:21:42.885
and promised we would keep writing forever
and , like, meet again very soon.

308
00:21:42.969 --> 00:21:46.139
- Did you?
- Of course not.

309
00:21:46.222 --> 00:21:48.141
Then I think this is
the opportune time to tell you

310
00:21:48.224 --> 00:21:50.435
that I happen to be a fantastic swimmer.

311
00:21:51.352 --> 00:21:53.271
- Really?
- Yeah.

312
00:21:53.354 --> 00:21:56.024
- I'll make note of that.
- Okay. Uh...

313
00:21:56.107 --> 00:21:58.693
- So it's my turn, no?
- All right. Yes, your turn.

314
00:21:58.776 --> 00:22:00.194
- Hit me.
- Um...

315
00:22:01.863 --> 00:22:03.614
Have you ever been in love?

316
00:22:05.533 --> 00:22:08.453
Yes. Next question.

317
00:22:08.536 --> 00:22:10.455
- What was the first ―
- Wait a minute.

318
00:22:10.538 --> 00:22:12.457
- So we can give one-word answers?
- Sure. Why not?

319
00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:15.918
No, no. After I went into such private details
about my first sexual feelings?

320
00:22:16.002 --> 00:22:18.129
I know, but those are
two very different questions.

321
00:22:18.212 --> 00:22:21.632
I could answer the sexual feelings thing ,
no problem , but love ―

322
00:22:21.716 --> 00:22:24.385
- What if I asked you about love?
-(giggles)

323
00:22:24.469 --> 00:22:27.680
I would have lied , but at least
I would have made up a great story.

324
00:22:27.764 --> 00:22:30.475
You would've lied! Great.
Love is a complex issue.

325
00:22:30.558 --> 00:22:32.477
I mean, it's like, um ―

326
00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.980
Yes, I have told somebody that I
loved them before, and I had meant it.

327
00:22:36.064 --> 00:22:39.692
But was it totally unselfish, giving love?

328
00:22:39.776 --> 00:22:42.528
Was it a beautiful thing? Not really.

329
00:22:42.612 --> 00:22:45.239
It's like, love ―

330
00:22:45.323 --> 00:22:47.658
I mean, I don't know.

331
00:22:47.742 --> 00:22:49.911
You know?

332
00:22:49.994 --> 00:22:51.662
Yeah, I know what you mean.

333
00:22:51.746 --> 00:22:53.873
But as far as sexual feelings go,

334
00:22:53.956 --> 00:22:58.836
I'll have you know it started with an obsessive
relationship with Miss July 1978.

335
00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.172
- Do you know <i>Playboy</i> magazine?
- Yeah, I've heard of it.

336
00:23:01.255 --> 00:23:02.840
- Do you know Crystal?
- No.

337
00:23:02.924 --> 00:23:05.676
You don't know Crystal?
Well, I knew Crystal.

338
00:23:06.511 --> 00:23:08.763
Um , is it my turn now?

339
00:23:08.846 --> 00:23:12.100
Okay, tell me something
that really pisses you off,

340
00:23:12.183 --> 00:23:14.102
really drives you crazy.

341
00:23:14.185 --> 00:23:18.022
- Pisses me off? Everything pisses me off.
- Okay, list a couple.

342
00:23:18.106 --> 00:23:19.774
Um... Wait, I know.

343
00:23:19.857 --> 00:23:23.528
I hate being told by strange men,
a strange man in the street ―

344
00:23:23.611 --> 00:23:24.862
Yeah?

345
00:23:24.946 --> 00:23:29.283
You know, like, to smile to make them
feel better about their boring life.

346
00:23:29.367 --> 00:23:31.119
Um , what else?

347
00:23:31.202 --> 00:23:35.039
I hate ―
I hate that 300 kilometers from here,

348
00:23:35.123 --> 00:23:38.960
there's a war going on, people are dying
and nobody knows what to do about it.

349
00:23:39.043 --> 00:23:41.337
Or they don't give a shit, I don't know.

350
00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:45.133
I hate that the medias ― You know,
they're trying to control our minds.

351
00:23:45.216 --> 00:23:47.135
- The media?
- Yeah, the media.

352
00:23:47.218 --> 00:23:50.471
It's very subtle,
but it's a new form of fascism , really.

353
00:23:50.555 --> 00:23:52.473
Um... Um...

354
00:23:52.557 --> 00:23:54.433
I hate ― (chuckles)

355
00:23:54.517 --> 00:23:58.396
I hate when I'm in a foreign country,
especially in America ― they're the worst.

356
00:23:58.479 --> 00:24:02.900
Each time I wear black or lose my temper
or say anything about anything ,

357
00:24:02.984 --> 00:24:05.903
they always go,
"Oh, it's so French, it's so cute."

358
00:24:05.987 --> 00:24:09.574
(makes gagging noise)
I hate that. I can't stand it, really.

359
00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:14.954
- Is that all?
- Well, there's a lot of things, but...

360
00:24:15.037 --> 00:24:17.582
- So, it's my turn.
- Okay.

361
00:24:17.665 --> 00:24:20.126
- You're gonna answer?
- Yes, I'll answer.

362
00:24:20.209 --> 00:24:23.880
- Uh, what's a problem for you?
- You, probably.

363
00:24:23.963 --> 00:24:25.923
(laughing) What?

364
00:24:26.007 --> 00:24:31.220
No. I had a thought the other day
that kind of qualifies as a problem.

365
00:24:31.304 --> 00:24:34.390
- What is it?
- It was a thought I had on the train.

366
00:24:34.473 --> 00:24:37.018
So okay, all right.

367
00:24:37.101 --> 00:24:39.562
Um , do you believe in reincarnation?

368
00:24:39.645 --> 00:24:41.772
- Yeah, yeah. It's interesting.
- Yeah. Right.

369
00:24:41.856 --> 00:24:45.610
Most people talk about past lives
and things like that.

370
00:24:45.693 --> 00:24:49.864
You know, and even if they don't
believe it in some specific way,

371
00:24:49.947 --> 00:24:52.408
people have some kind of notion
of an eternal soul, right?

372
00:24:52.491 --> 00:24:54.660
- Yeah.
- Okay. Well, this was my thought.

373
00:24:54.744 --> 00:24:58.372
50,000 years ago, there were not
even a million people on the planet.

374
00:24:58.456 --> 00:25:02.293
10,000 years ago, there's, like,
two million people on the planet.

375
00:25:02.376 --> 00:25:06.464
Now there's between five
and six billion people on the planet.

376
00:25:06.547 --> 00:25:11.844
Now, if we all have
our own individual, unique soul,

377
00:25:11.928 --> 00:25:13.804
where do they all come from?

378
00:25:13.888 --> 00:25:17.642
Are modern souls
only a fraction of the original souls?

379
00:25:17.725 --> 00:25:20.937
'Cause if they are,
that represents a 5,000-to-1 split

380
00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:23.231
of each soul
in just the last 50,000 years,

381
00:25:23.314 --> 00:25:25.650
which is like a blip in the earth's time.

382
00:25:25.733 --> 00:25:30.947
So at best, we're like these
tiny fractions of people walking...

383
00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:35.368
Is that why we're so scattered?
Is that why we're all so specialized?

384
00:25:35.451 --> 00:25:38.579
- Wait a minute. I'm not sure ― I don't agree ―
- I know, I know.

385
00:25:38.663 --> 00:25:40.498
It's a totally scattered thought.

386
00:25:41.582 --> 00:25:44.335
Which is kinda why
it makes sense, you know?

387
00:25:44.418 --> 00:25:46.337
I agree with you.

388
00:25:47.421 --> 00:25:49.382

I think it left a bigger impression on me
at that time

429

I know.

432
00:29:22.803 --> 00:29:25.973
There was this little old man that talked to us.
He was the groundskeeper.

433
00:29:26.056 --> 00:29:28.893
He explained that most of the people
buried here,

434
00:29:28.976 --> 00:29:31.729
they'd washed up on the bank
of the Danube.

435
00:29:33.272 --> 00:29:34.982
How old are these?

436
00:29:35.065 --> 00:29:37.568
Around the beginning of the century or so.

437
00:29:37.651 --> 00:29:40.404
It's called "Cemetery of the No-Name"
because they often didn't really know

438
00:29:40.488 --> 00:29:44.158
who those people were ―
maybe a first name, that's all.

439
00:29:44.241 --> 00:29:46.452
Why were all the bodies washing up?

440
00:29:46.535 --> 00:29:50.498
I think some were from accidents
on boats and things like that.

441
00:29:50.581 --> 00:29:53.626
But most of them were suicides
that jumped in the river.

442
00:29:55.669 --> 00:29:59.757
I always liked the idea of all those
unknown people lost in the world.

443
00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:04.136
When I was a little girl, I thought that if none
of your family or friends knew you were dead ,

444
00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:06.972
then it's like not really being dead.

445

446
00:30:13.395 --> 00:30:15.689
Ah, here she is, I think.

00:30:15.773 --> 00:30:18.776
Yeah, this is the one I remember the most.

448
00:30:22.071 --> 00:30:24.740
She was only 13 when she died.

449
00:30:24.823 --> 00:30:29.370
That meant something to me.
I was that age when I first saw this.

00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:10.716
And they try their best to be nice to me.

493
00:34:11.717 --> 00:34:14.470
- Did your parents divorce?
- Yeah, finally.

494
00:34:14.553 --> 00:34:17.181
They should've done it a lot sooner,
but they stuck together for a while

495
00:34:17.264 --> 00:34:20.017
for the well-being of my sister and I ,
thank you very much.

496
00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:23.103
-(chuckling)
- I remember my mother once ―

497
00:34:23.187 --> 00:34:26.482
She told me right in front of my father ―
They were having this big fight ―

498
00:34:26.565 --> 00:34:28.275
that he didn't really want to have me,

499
00:34:28.358 --> 00:34:31.695
that he was really pissed off when he
found out that she was pregnant with me,

500
00:34:31.779 --> 00:34:33.322
that I was this big mistake.

501
00:34:33.405 --> 00:34:35.324
That really shaped the way I think.

502
00:34:35.407 --> 00:34:39.203
I always saw the world as this place
where I really wasn't meant to be.

503
00:34:39.286 --> 00:34:40.829
That's so sad.

504
00:34:40.913 --> 00:34:46.585
Well, I mean, I eventually took pride in it,
like my life was my own doing or something ,

505
00:34:46.668 --> 00:34:49.213
like I was crashing the big party.

506
00:34:49.296 --> 00:34:52.049
(laughing) That's the way to see it.

507
00:34:52.132 --> 00:34:55.594
My parents, they're still married ,
and I guess they're very happy.

508
00:34:55.677 --> 00:35:00.307
But I think it's a healthy process to rebel
against everything that came before.

509
00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:02.643
Yeah. Yeah. But...

510
00:35:05.187 --> 00:35:06.939
I've been wondering lately.

511
00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:11.276
Do you know anyone
who's in a happy relationship?

512
00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:14.571
Uh, yeah, sure.

513
00:35:14.655 --> 00:35:16.198
I know happy couples.

514
00:35:17.074 --> 00:35:19.701
- But I think they lie to each other.
-(giggles)

515
00:35:19.785 --> 00:35:21.328
Yeah.

516
00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:24.331
People can live their whole life as a lie.

517
00:35:24.414 --> 00:35:26.416
My grandmother,
she was married to this man,

518
00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:29.837
and I always thought she had
a very simple, uncomplicated love life.

519
00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:32.089
But she just confessed to me

520
00:35:32.172 --> 00:35:37.261
that she spent her whole life dreaming about
another man she was always in love with.

521
00:35:37.344 --> 00:35:40.472
She just accepted her fate. It's so sad.

522
00:35:41.265 --> 00:35:44.601
In the same time, I love the idea
that she had those emotions and feelings

523
00:35:44.685 --> 00:35:46.603
I never thought she would have had.

524
00:35:46.687 --> 00:35:49.106
I guarantee you, it was better that way.

525
00:35:49.189 --> 00:35:52.734
If she'd ever got to know him , I'm sure
he would have disappointed her eventually.

526
00:35:52.818 --> 00:35:55.237
- How do know? You don't know them.
- Yeah, I know.

527
00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:58.448
It's just, people have these romantic
projections they put on everything

528
00:35:58.532 --> 00:36:00.909
that's not based on any kind of reality.

529
00:36:00.993 --> 00:36:02.744
- Romantic projections?
- Yeah.

530
00:36:02.828 --> 00:36:05.247
Oh, Mr. Romantic
up there on the Ferris wheel ―

531
00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:09.167
-"Oh, kiss me. The sunset. Oh, it's so beautiful."
- All right, all right.

532
00:36:09.251 --> 00:36:11.879
Tell me about your grandmother.
What were you saying about her?

533
00:36:11.962 --> 00:36:15.132
-(giggling)
-(shouts)

534
00:36:29.146 --> 00:36:31.607
JESSE: Hey, check these guys out.

535
00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:33.817
"Hey, Hans, I have a confession to make.

536
00:36:33.901 --> 00:36:35.819
I'm not wearing any underwear
underneath this thing."

537
00:36:35.903 --> 00:36:38.906
-(laughing)
-"Oh, really? Does that frighten you?"

538
00:36:45.454 --> 00:36:48.498
- Can I tell you a secret?
- Yeah.

539
00:36:48.582 --> 00:36:50.459
- Come here.
- What?

540
00:36:50.542 --> 00:36:52.294
Come here.

541
00:37:02.137 --> 00:37:04.348
(laughter)

542
00:37:05.557 --> 00:37:08.602
CELINE: Look at this palm reader.
She's interesting-looking , no?

543
00:37:08.685 --> 00:37:10.187
JESSE: Yeah.

544
00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:11.897
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
- What?

545
00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:14.775
- I just made eye contact.
- She's not coming over?

546
00:37:14.858 --> 00:37:16.526
- Yeah, she is.
- Oh, shit.

547
00:37:17.778 --> 00:37:19.905
(Celine laughing)

548
00:37:19.988 --> 00:37:21.490
- Oh, no.
- Oh, my God.

549
00:37:21.573 --> 00:37:23.700
- CELINE: You want your palm read?
- No. Not at all.

550
00:37:23.784 --> 00:37:25.786
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

551
00:37:25.869 --> 00:37:27.663
- Okay.
- Hello.

552
00:37:27.746 --> 00:37:29.164
Here she is.

553
00:37:30.082 --> 00:37:32.751
(speaking German)

554
00:37:32.834 --> 00:37:35.504
Uh, <i>Français,</i> English?

555
00:37:39.675 --> 00:37:41.969
I want your palm read.

556
00:37:44.012 --> 00:37:46.223
Yeah. How much is it?

557
00:37:46.306 --> 00:37:49.309
For you, 50. Okay?

558
00:37:49.393 --> 00:37:50.894
Okay.

559
00:37:55.607 --> 00:37:56.817
Oh.

560
00:37:56.900 --> 00:38:00.153
So you have been on a journey

561
00:38:00.237 --> 00:38:02.280
and you are a stranger to this place.

562
00:38:03.198 --> 00:38:07.077
(chuckles) You are an adventurer,

563
00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:08.578
a seeker,

564
00:38:09.663 --> 00:38:12.207
an adventurer in your mind.

565
00:38:16.211 --> 00:38:20.215
You are interested
in the power of the woman,

566
00:38:20.298 --> 00:38:25.429
in a woman's deep strength and creativity.

567
00:38:25.512 --> 00:38:27.723
You're becoming this woman.

568
00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:38.025
But you need to resign yourself
to the awkwardness of life.

569
00:38:38.108 --> 00:38:41.570
Only if you find peace within yourself

570
00:38:42.279 --> 00:38:45.866
will you find true connection with others.

571
00:38:49.286 --> 00:38:52.789
- He is a stranger to you?
- Mmm , I guess so.

572
00:38:57.627 --> 00:39:01.006
(sighs)
You will be all right. He's learning.

573
00:39:01.089 --> 00:39:03.050
(chuckles) Okay.

574
00:39:03.842 --> 00:39:05.427
Money.

575
00:39:12.559 --> 00:39:14.603
You're both stars.

576
00:39:14.686 --> 00:39:16.730
Don't forget.

577
00:39:16.813 --> 00:39:19.900
When the stars exploded
billions of years ago,

578
00:39:19.983 --> 00:39:22.944
they formed everything that is this world.

579
00:39:23.028 --> 00:39:26.031
Everything we know is stardust.

580
00:39:26.114 --> 00:39:29.785
So don't forget you are stardust.

581
00:39:29.868 --> 00:39:31.870
(laughing)

582
00:39:34.748 --> 00:39:36.750
I mean, that's very nice and all,

583
00:39:36.833 --> 00:39:42.172
I mean, that we're all stardust
and you're becoming this great woman.

584
00:39:42.255 --> 00:39:44.257
But I hope you don't
take that any more seriously

585
00:39:44.341 --> 00:39:47.260
than some horoscope
in a daily syndicated newspaper.

586
00:39:47.344 --> 00:39:49.262
What are you talking about?

587
00:39:49.346 --> 00:39:51.890
She knew I was on vacation
and that we didn't know each other

588
00:39:51.973 --> 00:39:54.226
and that I was going to
become this great woman.

589
00:39:54.309 --> 00:39:57.521
But what was that
"I am learning" bullshit?

590
00:39:57.604 --> 00:40:00.190
That's way condescending , you know?

591
00:40:00.273 --> 00:40:02.192
She wasn't even doing me.

592
00:40:02.275 --> 00:40:06.738
I mean, if opportunists like that
ever had to tell the real truth,

593
00:40:06.822 --> 00:40:08.949
it would put their asses out of business.

594
00:40:09.032 --> 00:40:12.077
Just once I'd love to see
some little old lady

595
00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:15.122
save up all her money
to go to the fortune-teller,

596
00:40:15.205 --> 00:40:18.667
she'd get there all excited about hearing
her future and the woman would say,

597
00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:23.839
"Uh-huh... Tomorrow
and all your remaining days

598
00:40:23.922 --> 00:40:26.091
will be exactly like today,

599
00:40:26.174 --> 00:40:28.802
a tedious collection of hours.

600
00:40:28.885 --> 00:40:32.264
And you will have no new passions
and no new thoughts

601
00:40:32.347 --> 00:40:34.724
and no new travels.

602
00:40:34.808 --> 00:40:37.102
And when you die,
you'll be completely forgotten."

603
00:40:37.185 --> 00:40:38.478
You know?

604
00:40:38.562 --> 00:40:40.313
"Fifty schillings, please."

605
00:40:40.397 --> 00:40:42.566
- That I'd like to see.
-(laughs)

606
00:40:43.316 --> 00:40:46.695
It's so funny how she almost
didn't notice you, huh?

607
00:40:46.778 --> 00:40:48.572
It's weird. I wonder why.

608
00:40:48.655 --> 00:40:51.825
- She was really wise and intense.
- Wi ― Yeah?

609
00:40:51.908 --> 00:40:54.161
- I really love what she said.
- Of course you do.

610
00:40:54.244 --> 00:40:57.038
You pay your money, you hear something
that makes you feel good about yourself.

611
00:40:57.122 --> 00:41:00.750
If you want, there's a seedy section
of Vienna we can buy a hit of crack.

612
00:41:00.834 --> 00:41:02.752
Would you like that? Huh? Yeah?

613
00:41:02.836 --> 00:41:04.754
(giggles) You're so ―

614
00:41:05.881 --> 00:41:07.757
Stardust! Stardust!

615
00:41:12.762 --> 00:41:15.390
Ow! (French)

616
00:41:17.267 --> 00:41:18.810
Oh, there's an exhibition.

617
00:41:20.103 --> 00:41:22.063
Yup, I guess we'll miss it.

618
00:41:22.147 --> 00:41:24.566
Doesn't start until next week.

619
00:41:24.649 --> 00:41:26.568
Yeah, I think so.

620
00:41:28.778 --> 00:41:31.573
I actually saw this one
a few years ago in a museum.

621
00:41:32.699 --> 00:41:36.828
I stared and stared at it.
Must have been 45 minutes.

622
00:41:38.038 --> 00:41:39.164
I love it.

623
00:41:40.081 --> 00:41:42.334
<i>"La Voie Ferrée.</i> " That's great.

624
00:41:44.169 --> 00:41:47.839
I love the way the people seem
to be dissolving into the background.

625
00:41:49.299 --> 00:41:51.885
Look at this one.

626
00:41:51.968 --> 00:41:55.764
It's like the environment's,
you know, stronger than the people.

627
00:41:57.724 --> 00:42:00.769
His human figures
are always so transitory.

628
00:42:00.852 --> 00:42:03.188
It's funny. Transitory?

629
00:42:03.271 --> 00:42:05.065
Transitory.

630
00:42:10.654 --> 00:42:13.323
-(footsteps)
-(bell tolling)

631
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:26.711
- You think this is open?
- I don't know. Let's try it.

632
00:42:26.795 --> 00:42:28.964
(horn honking)

633
00:42:53.154 --> 00:42:56.199
I was in an old church
like this with my grandmother

634
00:42:56.283 --> 00:42:58.201
a few days ago in Budapest.

635
00:43:00.495 --> 00:43:03.665
Even though I reject
most of the religious thing ,

636
00:43:03.748 --> 00:43:06.668
I can't help but feeling
for all those people

637
00:43:06.751 --> 00:43:10.839
that come here, lost or in pain, guilt,

638
00:43:11.923 --> 00:43:13.842
looking for some kind of answers.

639
00:43:15.677 --> 00:43:19.514
It fascinates me how a single place
can join so much pain and happiness

640
00:43:19.597 --> 00:43:22.309
for so many generations.

641
00:43:22.392 --> 00:43:23.935
You close with your grandmother?

642
00:43:26.521 --> 00:43:28.148
Yeah.

643
00:43:29.774 --> 00:43:32.694
I think it's because
I always have this strange feeling

644
00:43:32.777 --> 00:43:35.655
that I'm this very old woman,

645
00:43:35.739 --> 00:43:37.490
laying down, about to die.

646
00:43:39.326 --> 00:43:43.663
You know, that my life is just
memories or something.

647
00:43:47.375 --> 00:43:49.294
That's so wild.

648
00:43:49.377 --> 00:43:54.299
I mean, I always think that
I'm still this 13-year-old boy

649
00:43:54.382 --> 00:43:56.593
who doesn't really know
how to be an adult,

650
00:43:56.676 --> 00:44:02.557
pretending to live my life, taking notes
for when I'll really have to do it.

651
00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:05.935
Kind of like I'm in a dress rehearsal
for a junior high play.

652
00:44:08.438 --> 00:44:10.565
That's funny.

653
00:44:10.648 --> 00:44:14.361
Then up there in the Ferris wheel
was, like, this very old woman

654
00:44:14.444 --> 00:44:16.154
kissing this very young boy.

655
00:44:16.237 --> 00:44:17.947
- Right?
- Mmm.

656
00:44:22.077 --> 00:44:26.498
Do you know anything about the Quakers ―
the Quaker religion?

657
00:44:26.581 --> 00:44:28.583
- No, not much.
- No?

658
00:44:28.666 --> 00:44:31.294
I went to this Quaker wedding once.

659
00:44:31.378 --> 00:44:33.546
It was fantastic.

660
00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:36.966
What they do is the couple comes in
and they kneel down

661
00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:39.344
in front of the whole congregation,

662
00:44:39.427 --> 00:44:41.971
and they just stare at each other.

663
00:44:42.055 --> 00:44:43.431
And nobody says a word

664
00:44:43.515 --> 00:44:47.936
unless they feel that God moves them
to speak or say something.

665
00:44:48.937 --> 00:44:52.941
And then after an hour or so of just, uh,

666
00:44:53.024 --> 00:44:55.193
staring at each other,

667
00:44:55.276 --> 00:44:57.070
they're married.

668
00:44:58.405 --> 00:45:00.698
That's beautiful. I like that.

669
00:45:17.006 --> 00:45:18.967
This is a horrible story.

670
00:45:19.884 --> 00:45:21.052
What?

671
00:45:21.136 --> 00:45:23.263
It's not the appropriate place to tell it, but ―

672
00:45:23.346 --> 00:45:27.058
- What?
- I was driving around with this buddy of mine.

673
00:45:27.142 --> 00:45:28.643
He's a big atheist.

674
00:45:28.726 --> 00:45:32.313
And we came to a stop
next to this homeless guy.

675
00:45:32.397 --> 00:45:35.024
My buddy takes out a hundred-dollar bill,

676
00:45:35.108 --> 00:45:38.528
he leans out of the window and he says,

677
00:45:38.611 --> 00:45:40.822
"Do you believe in God?"

678
00:45:40.905 --> 00:45:44.617
The guy looks at my friend ,
he looks at the money,

679
00:45:44.701 --> 00:45:46.119
says, uh...

680
00:45:46.953 --> 00:45:48.746
"Yes, I do."

681
00:45:48.830 --> 00:45:52.208
My friend says, "Wrong answer."
We drove away.

682
00:45:53.293 --> 00:45:56.546
- That's mean, no?
- Yeah. Yeah.

683
00:46:04.262 --> 00:46:05.972
Ow! (laughing)

684
00:46:06.055 --> 00:46:10.351
Would you be in Paris by now
if you hadn't gotten off the train with me?

685
00:46:10.435 --> 00:46:12.020
No, not yet.

686
00:46:12.979 --> 00:46:14.647
What would you be doing?

687
00:46:14.731 --> 00:46:17.400
I'd probably be hanging around the airport,
reading old magazines,

688
00:46:17.484 --> 00:46:20.153
crying in my coffee
'cause you didn't come with me.

689
00:46:20.236 --> 00:46:22.113
Oh! Oh.

690
00:46:24.908 --> 00:46:28.912
Actually, I think I'd probably gotten off
the train in Salzburg with someone else.

691
00:46:28.995 --> 00:46:31.122
Oh, yeah? Oh, I see.

692
00:46:31.206 --> 00:46:33.291
So I'm just a dumb American

693
00:46:33.374 --> 00:46:37.545
momentarily decorating
your blank canvas, huh?

694
00:46:37.629 --> 00:46:39.797
- I'm having a great time.
- Really?

695
00:46:39.881 --> 00:46:41.716
- Yeah.
- Me too.

696
00:46:43.885 --> 00:46:47.514
I'm so glad because no one knows I'm here,
and I don't know anyone that knows you

697
00:46:47.597 --> 00:46:50.600
that would tell me
all the bad things you've done.

698
00:46:50.683 --> 00:46:53.019
- I'll tell you some.
- Yeah, I'm sure.

699
00:46:53.978 --> 00:46:56.940
You know, you hear
so much shit about people.

700
00:46:57.023 --> 00:47:00.735
I always feel like the general of an army
when I start dating a guy,

701
00:47:00.818 --> 00:47:02.987
plotting my strategy and maneuverings,

702
00:47:03.071 --> 00:47:06.115
knowing his weak points,
what would hurt him , seduce him.

703
00:47:07.033 --> 00:47:08.701
It's horrible.

704
00:47:12.664 --> 00:47:14.582
If we were around each other all the time,

705
00:47:14.666 --> 00:47:18.044
what would be the first thing about me
that would drive you mad?

706
00:47:18.127 --> 00:47:20.588
Mmm ― Uh, no, no.
I'm not going to answer this question.

707
00:47:20.672 --> 00:47:21.923
- What?
- No.

708
00:47:22.006 --> 00:47:25.510
I just ― I dated this girl once
who used to always ask me that.

709
00:47:25.593 --> 00:47:27.470
-"What about me bugs you?"
- Uh-huh.

710
00:47:27.554 --> 00:47:31.391
So finally I said , "Well, I don't think
you handle criticism too well."

711
00:47:31.474 --> 00:47:34.644
She flew into a rage and broke up with me.
That's a true story.

712
00:47:34.727 --> 00:47:37.313
All she ever really wanted to do
was to have an excuse

713
00:47:37.397 --> 00:47:39.899
to tell me what she thought
was wrong with me.

714
00:47:39.983 --> 00:47:41.526
- Is that what you want?
- What?

715
00:47:41.609 --> 00:47:43.444
- Something about me bugs you?
- No.

716
00:47:43.528 --> 00:47:46.614
- Tell me. What is it about me bugs you?
- Nothing at all.

717
00:47:46.698 --> 00:47:49.367
If it had to be something ,
what would it be?

718
00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:53.204
If it had to be something ,
if I <i>had</i> to think about it,

719
00:47:53.288 --> 00:47:57.000
I kind of didn't really like this reaction
back at the palm reader.

720
00:47:57.083 --> 00:47:59.544
You were like this rooster prick.

721
00:47:59.627 --> 00:48:01.879
Rooster prick?
What the hell is a rooster prick?

722
00:48:01.963 --> 00:48:06.175
You were like a little boy whining because
all the attention wasn't focused on him.

723
00:48:06.259 --> 00:48:09.387
Listen, this woman robs you blind , okay?

724
00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:12.015
You were like a little boy,
walking by an ice cream store,

725
00:48:12.098 --> 00:48:15.059
crying because his mother wouldn't
buy him a milk shake or something.

726
00:48:15.143 --> 00:48:18.438
- I don't care what the charlatan has to say ―
-(man speaking German) Hello.

727
00:48:18.521 --> 00:48:20.982
-(speaking German)
- What?

728
00:48:22.066 --> 00:48:25.403
-(German)
- Oh. I understand a little bit.

729
00:48:25.486 --> 00:48:28.031
But he doesn't at all. I'm sorry.

730
00:48:28.114 --> 00:48:30.658
Okay, so, um...

731
00:48:30.742 --> 00:48:32.327
May I ask you a question?

732
00:48:33.077 --> 00:48:34.621
Yeah.

733
00:48:34.704 --> 00:48:37.582
So, I would like to make a deal with you.

734
00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:44.047
I mean, instead of just asking you for money,
I will ask you for a word.

735
00:48:44.130 --> 00:48:46.591
You give me a word. I'll take the word.

736
00:48:46.674 --> 00:48:50.178
Then I will write a poem
with the word inside.

737
00:48:51.346 --> 00:48:53.890
And if you like it, if you like my poem ,

738
00:48:53.973 --> 00:48:57.018
if you feel it adds something
to your life in any way,

739
00:48:57.101 --> 00:48:59.687
then you can pay me
whatever you feel like.

740
00:49:00.396 --> 00:49:02.398
I write in English, of course.

741
00:49:03.524 --> 00:49:05.318
- Okay.
- All right. Great.

742
00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:09.572
So?

743
00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:11.658
Pick a word.

744
00:49:12.450 --> 00:49:14.202
Oh, um ―

745
00:49:14.285 --> 00:49:17.914
A word. Um... milk shake.

746
00:49:17.997 --> 00:49:22.251
Milk shake. Oh, good. I was gonna say
"rooster prick." But great. Milk shake.

747
00:49:22.335 --> 00:49:26.214
Milk shake? Okay. Milk shake.

748
00:49:26.923 --> 00:49:29.425
- All right, so, we'll...
- Good.

749
00:49:39.769 --> 00:49:44.190
JESSE: Gotta say I like this
Viennese variation of a bum.

750
00:49:44.273 --> 00:49:46.901
I like what he said about
adding something to your life, no?

751
00:49:46.984 --> 00:49:48.152
Yeah.

752
00:49:48.236 --> 00:49:51.656
So, uh, were we having
our first fight back there?

753
00:49:51.739 --> 00:49:53.658
- No.
- Yeah, I think so.

754
00:49:53.741 --> 00:49:55.159
I think we were.

755
00:49:55.243 --> 00:49:58.955
Even if we were a little bit, why does
everyone think conflict is so bad?

756
00:49:59.038 --> 00:50:01.165
There's a lot of good things
coming out of conflict.

757
00:50:01.249 --> 00:50:05.378
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so. I don't know.

758
00:50:05.461 --> 00:50:09.507
I always think if I could just accept the fact
that my life was supposed to be difficult,

759
00:50:09.590 --> 00:50:11.634
that's what's to be expected ,

760
00:50:11.718 --> 00:50:16.723
then I might not get so pissed off about it
and I'd be glad when something nice happens.

761
00:50:16.806 --> 00:50:20.560
Maybe that's why I'm still in school.
It's easier to have something to fight against.

762
00:50:20.643 --> 00:50:24.939
Yeah, well, we've all had such
competitiveness ingrained in us.

763
00:50:25.022 --> 00:50:27.442
I can be doing the most nothing thing.

764
00:50:27.525 --> 00:50:31.154
I can be throwing some darts,
shooting some pool,

765
00:50:31.237 --> 00:50:34.157
and all of a sudden
I feel it come over me ―

766
00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:36.534
I have <i>got</i> to win.

767
00:50:36.617 --> 00:50:40.037
CELINE: Is that why you tried to
get me off the train ― competitiveness?

768
00:50:40.121 --> 00:50:41.748
- JESSE: What do you mean?
- Okay.

769
00:50:43.166 --> 00:50:44.834
Got your poem.

770
00:50:44.917 --> 00:50:46.919
Oh, all right.

771
00:50:48.421 --> 00:50:50.423
Will you read it to us?

772
00:50:53.676 --> 00:50:55.428
Sure. Okay.

773
00:50:59.182 --> 00:51:01.392
"Daydream delusion,

774
00:51:01.476 --> 00:51:03.269
limousine eyelash.

775
00:51:04.061 --> 00:51:06.439
Oh, baby, with your pretty face.

776
00:51:08.065 --> 00:51:09.901
Drop a tear in my wine glass.

777
00:51:09.984 --> 00:51:12.236
Look at those big eyes.

778
00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:14.864
See what you mean to me ―

779
00:51:14.947 --> 00:51:17.658
sweet cakes and milk shakes.

780
00:51:17.742 --> 00:51:19.911
I'm a delusion angel.

781
00:51:20.703 --> 00:51:23.247
I'm a fantasy parade.

782
00:51:23.331 --> 00:51:27.460
I want you to know what I think.
Don't want you to guess anymore.

783
00:51:27.543 --> 00:51:30.087
You have no idea where I came from.

784
00:51:30.171 --> 00:51:32.173
We have no idea where we're going.

785
00:51:32.256 --> 00:51:36.177
Lodged in life like branches in the river.

786
00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:39.305
Flowing downstream , caught in the current.

787
00:51:39.388 --> 00:51:42.433
I'll carry you. You'll carry me.

788
00:51:43.434 --> 00:51:45.144
That's how it could be.

789
00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:48.773
Don't you know me?

790
00:51:48.856 --> 00:51:50.817
Don't you know me by now?"

791
00:51:51.943 --> 00:51:53.778
Great.

792
00:51:53.861 --> 00:51:55.863
- Thanks.
- Thanks, man.

793
00:51:56.614 --> 00:51:58.115
Uh ―

794
00:51:59.659 --> 00:52:00.993
Here you go, uh ―

795
00:52:02.745 --> 00:52:04.497
- Thanks.
- JESSE: All right.

796
00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:06.874
- Here. Thank you.
- Thank you.

797
00:52:06.958 --> 00:52:08.918
- Good luck, man.
- Bye.

798
00:52:09.001 --> 00:52:10.503
- Bye.
- Bye.

799
00:52:24.183 --> 00:52:26.686
- That's wonderful, no?
- Yeah, yeah.

800
00:52:30.565 --> 00:52:33.568
- What?
- You know he probably didn't just write that.

801
00:52:33.651 --> 00:52:36.404
He wrote it, but he probably
just plugs that word in ―

802
00:52:36.487 --> 00:52:38.698
whatever ― milk shake, you know.

803
00:52:38.781 --> 00:52:40.616
What do you mean?

804
00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:42.785
Nothing. I loved it. It was great.

805
00:52:42.869 --> 00:52:44.370
(laughing)

806
00:52:50.293 --> 00:52:52.253
- JESSE: You know what drives me crazy?
- What?

807
00:52:52.336 --> 00:52:56.090
There's all these people talking about
how great technology is and how it saves time.

808
00:52:56.173 --> 00:53:01.095
But what good is saved time if nobody uses it,
if it just turns into more busy work?

809
00:53:01.178 --> 00:53:02.221
- Yeah.
- Right?

810
00:53:02.305 --> 00:53:06.475
You never hear somebody say, "With the time
I've saved by using my word processor,

811
00:53:06.559 --> 00:53:08.978
I'm gonna go to a Zen monastery
and hang out."

812
00:53:09.061 --> 00:53:10.563
-(Celine laughs)
- You don't hear that.

813
00:53:10.646 --> 00:53:12.940
Time is abstract anyway.

814
00:53:13.024 --> 00:53:15.610
- Were you looking at this girl?
- What?

815
00:53:15.693 --> 00:53:17.695
(Celine laughs)

816
00:53:17.778 --> 00:53:19.530
- You want to go in here?
- What?

817
00:53:19.614 --> 00:53:22.658
- You want to go in here?
- Yeah. It's a club, no?

818
00:53:22.742 --> 00:53:24.243
Yeah.

819
00:53:25.202 --> 00:53:26.370
- You want to go?
- Yeah.

820
00:53:26.454 --> 00:53:27.830
Hello.

821
00:53:27.914 --> 00:53:30.207
-(speaking German)
- Fifty schillings.

822
00:53:30.291 --> 00:53:31.792
- Fifty schillings.
- Each.

823
00:53:31.876 --> 00:53:35.046
I got a hundred. Here. I got it.

824
00:53:35.129 --> 00:53:37.256
I'll buy you a beer. Thank you.

All right.

<i>Merde!</i>

841
00:54:59.588 --> 00:55:01.799
Well, um ―

842
00:55:01.882 --> 00:55:05.845
We haven't talked about this yet,
but are you dating anyone?

843
00:55:05.928 --> 00:55:10.433
You got a boyfriend waiting on you
back in Paris or anything like that?

844
00:55:10.516 --> 00:55:13.144
- No, not right now.
- Not right ― But you did.

845
00:55:14.603 --> 00:55:16.689
We broke up about six months ago.

846
00:55:16.772 --> 00:55:17.982
- Six months?
- Yeah.

847
00:55:18.065 --> 00:55:19.316
Oh, I'm sorry.

848
00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:22.069
I mean, I'm not that sorry.
But tell me about him.

849
00:55:22.153 --> 00:55:24.488
Oh, no. No way. I can't.

850
00:55:24.572 --> 00:55:27.950
- It's really ― really boring.
- Come on, tell me about him.

851
00:55:29.076 --> 00:55:32.121
Okay. I was really disappointed.

852
00:55:32.204 --> 00:55:34.165
I thought this one would last for a while.

853
00:55:34.248 --> 00:55:38.461
I mean, he was very stupid ,
ugly, bad in bed ,

854
00:55:38.544 --> 00:55:41.297
alcoholic, you know.

855
00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:44.216
- A real prizewinner.
- Yeah. (laughing)

856
00:55:44.300 --> 00:55:46.927
I was kind of giving him a favor,
but he left me,

857
00:55:47.011 --> 00:55:48.929
saying I loved him too much

858
00:55:49.013 --> 00:55:52.933
and , you know, I was blocking
his artistic expression and stuff.

859
00:55:53.017 --> 00:55:54.810
Shit like that, you know.

860
00:55:54.894 --> 00:55:57.313
But anyway, I was traumatized and became ―

861
00:55:57.396 --> 00:56:00.441
(sighs) And became
totally obsessed with him.

862
00:56:00.524 --> 00:56:04.445
And so I went to see this shrink, you know,
and it came up that I had written

863
00:56:04.528 --> 00:56:08.532
this little, stupid story about this woman
trying to kill her boyfriend...

864
00:56:09.617 --> 00:56:13.245
and how she was gonna do it,
you know, all the intricate details.

865
00:56:13.329 --> 00:56:16.665
- How to do it and not get caught.
- She was gonna kill her boyfriend?

866
00:56:16.749 --> 00:56:18.125
Yeah. (laughing)

867
00:56:18.209 --> 00:56:20.586
Yeah, she was. I mean ―

868
00:56:20.669 --> 00:56:23.589
It's nothing I would do,
but it was just some writing.

869
00:56:23.672 --> 00:56:25.091
No, I understand.

870
00:56:25.174 --> 00:56:27.760
Anyway, this stupid shrink believed
everything I was telling her.

871
00:56:27.843 --> 00:56:29.804
It was my first time seeing her.

872
00:56:29.887 --> 00:56:33.224
- She said she <i>had</i> to call the police.
- She had to call the police?

873
00:56:33.307 --> 00:56:38.020
She was ― <i>Merde!</i> She was totally
convinced I was really gonna do it.

874
00:56:38.104 --> 00:56:41.190
Even though I'd explained to her
it was just some writing and stuff.

875
00:56:41.273 --> 00:56:44.443
She said , looking deep into my eyes,
"The way you said it.

876
00:56:44.527 --> 00:56:47.238
I know you are going to do it,
the way you said it!"

877
00:56:47.321 --> 00:56:49.782
- She was totally out of her mind.
- Aaah!

878
00:56:49.865 --> 00:56:52.368
It was my first and last session.

879
00:56:52.451 --> 00:56:54.495
So what happened then?

880
00:56:54.578 --> 00:56:56.205
Hmm.

881
00:56:56.288 --> 00:56:58.457
I totally got over him , you know.

882
00:56:58.541 --> 00:57:04.421
But now I'm obsessed that he's gonna die
from an accident a thousand kilometers away.

883
00:57:04.505 --> 00:57:07.091
- Oh, right.
- I'm gonna be the one accused.

884
00:57:09.927 --> 00:57:14.014
Why is it you become obsessed with people
you don't really like that much?

885
00:57:14.098 --> 00:57:16.433
- You know what I mean?
- I don't know.

886
00:57:18.602 --> 00:57:20.688
So how about you?

887
00:57:21.522 --> 00:57:23.983
- What?
- Are you with anyone?

888
00:57:24.066 --> 00:57:25.776
Um ―

889
00:57:25.860 --> 00:57:29.488
It's funny how we managed
to avoid this subject for so long.

890
00:57:29.572 --> 00:57:31.657
Yeah, but now you have to tell me.

891
00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:36.495
Well, I kind of see love
as this escape for two people

892
00:57:36.579 --> 00:57:38.414
who don't know how to be alone, you know?

893
00:57:38.497 --> 00:57:40.666
Or, uh ― You know what's funny?

894
00:57:40.749 --> 00:57:45.671
People always talk about how love
is this totally unselfish, giving thing.

895
00:57:45.754 --> 00:57:49.133
But if you think about it,
there's nothing more selfish.

896
00:57:49.216 --> 00:57:50.843
Yeah, I know.

897
00:57:52.011 --> 00:57:53.888
So, who just broke up with you?

898
00:57:55.806 --> 00:57:57.308
What?

899
00:57:59.310 --> 00:58:01.645
You sound like you've just been hurt
or something.

900
00:58:01.729 --> 00:58:03.397
- Oh, do I?
- Yeah.

901
00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:05.024
All right, um ―

902
00:58:05.774 --> 00:58:07.776
A big confession, you know?

903
00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:10.404
I should have told you this earlier
or something , but...

904
00:58:11.572 --> 00:58:16.285
I didn't come to Europe just to hang out
and read Hemingway in Paris

905
00:58:16.368 --> 00:58:18.245
and shit like that, you know.

906
00:58:18.329 --> 00:58:21.624
I saved up my money all spring
to fly to Madrid

907
00:58:21.707 --> 00:58:24.335
and spend the summer
with my girlfriend who has been ―

908
00:58:24.418 --> 00:58:26.337
- Your girlfriend?
- My ex-girlfriend.

909
00:58:26.420 --> 00:58:29.798
Who's been in this asinine
art history program for the last year.

910
00:58:29.882 --> 00:58:33.469
Anyway, I got here, right,
and we were reunited at long last,

911
00:58:33.552 --> 00:58:37.723
and we went out to dinner our first night
with six of her friends ―

912
00:58:37.806 --> 00:58:40.643
Pedro, Antonio, Gonzalo,

913
00:58:40.726 --> 00:58:43.020
Maria, Suzy from home, you know?

914
00:58:43.103 --> 00:58:46.690
She pretty much managed to avoid being
alone with me for the first couple of days,

915
00:58:46.774 --> 00:58:49.777
and I stuck around for a while
just to kinda let it really sink in

916
00:58:49.860 --> 00:58:52.363
that she wished I hadn't come.

917
00:58:53.155 --> 00:58:55.157
So I bought the cheapest flight
out of Europe,

918
00:58:55.241 --> 00:58:58.494
this one leaving out of Vienna tomorrow,
but it didn't leave for a couple of weeks,

919
00:58:58.577 --> 00:59:01.121
so I bought this Eurail pass, you know.

920
00:59:01.205 --> 00:59:04.750
You know what's the worst thing
about somebody breaking up with you?

921
00:59:06.794 --> 00:59:09.755
- Yeah?
- It's when you remember how little you thought

922
00:59:09.838 --> 00:59:11.882
about the people you broke up with

923
00:59:11.966 --> 00:59:15.970
and you realize that that is how little
they're thinking about you.

924
00:59:16.053 --> 00:59:17.596
- Oh. (chuckling)
- You know?

925
00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:20.724
You'd like to think that you're both
in all this pain, but really, they're just,

926
00:59:20.808 --> 00:59:22.643
-"Hey, I'm glad you're gone."
-(laughing)

927
00:59:22.726 --> 00:59:25.229
Believe me, I know.

928
00:59:25.312 --> 00:59:28.899
- You should look at bright colors.
- What?

929
00:59:28.983 --> 00:59:31.110
That's what the shrink told me, you know?

930
00:59:31.193 --> 00:59:36.282
I was paying her 900 francs an hour
to hear that I was a homicidal maniac,

931
00:59:36.365 --> 00:59:40.327
but I could perhaps shift my obsession
if I would concentrate on bright colors.

932
00:59:40.411 --> 00:59:42.454
Well, did it work?

933
00:59:42.538 --> 00:59:44.039
Well ―

934
00:59:45.541 --> 00:59:48.085
- It didn't help your pinball.
- Well, no. (laughing)

935
00:59:48.168 --> 00:59:52.131
Yeah, well, you know,
I mean, I haven't killed anyone lately.

936
00:59:52.214 --> 00:59:53.841
- Not lately?
- Mmm.

937
00:59:53.924 --> 00:59:55.926
Well, that's good. You're cured then.

938
01:00:02.016 --> 01:00:07.187
I mean, there's these breeds of monkeys, right?
And all they do is have sex, like, all the time.

939
01:00:07.271 --> 01:00:12.026
And , uh, they turn out to be the least violent,
the most peaceful, the most happy ―

940
01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:15.529
You know? So, I mean,
maybe foolin' around's not so bad.

941
01:00:15.612 --> 01:00:18.365
- Are you talking about monkeys?
- Yes, I'm talking about monkeys.

942
01:00:18.449 --> 01:00:20.534
- Ah, I thought so. Yeah. You know?
- Why?

943
01:00:20.617 --> 01:00:24.371
I never heard this one,
but it reminds me of this perfect, you know,

944
01:00:24.455 --> 01:00:26.874
male argument
to justify them fooling around.

945
01:00:26.957 --> 01:00:28.959
No, no, no!
Women monkeys are foolin' around too.

946
01:00:29.043 --> 01:00:30.544
- Everybody's fooling around.
-(groans)

947
01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:33.047
- Ooh! Ooh!
- Yeah ― That's cute.

948
01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:38.761
You know, I have this awful, paranoid thought
that feminism was mostly invented by men

949
01:00:38.844 --> 01:00:41.055
so they could , like,
fool around a little more.

950
01:00:41.138 --> 01:00:44.391
You know, "Woman, free your mind.
Free your body. Sleep with me.

951
01:00:44.475 --> 01:00:47.770
We're all happy and free as long
as I can fuck as much as I can."

952
01:00:47.853 --> 01:00:50.731
- Ah! All right, all right.
- I'm sure.

953
01:00:50.814 --> 01:00:53.609
But maybe, maybe there's
some biological things at work here.

954
01:00:53.692 --> 01:00:55.652
- Biological.
- If you had an island , right?

955
01:00:55.736 --> 01:00:56.737
Yeah?

956
01:00:56.820 --> 01:01:00.908
And there were 99 women on the island
and only one man,

957
01:01:00.991 --> 01:01:03.702
in a year you'd have
the possibility of 99 babies.

958
01:01:03.786 --> 01:01:04.787
Right.

959
01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:07.706
But if you have an island with 99 <i>men</i>
and only one woman,

960
01:01:07.790 --> 01:01:10.584
in a year you have the possibility
of only one baby.

961
01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:13.045
- So ―
- So ― You know what?

962
01:01:13.128 --> 01:01:15.047
- What?
- On this island , you know,

963
01:01:15.130 --> 01:01:17.966
I think there will be only,
like, maybe 43 men left

964
01:01:18.050 --> 01:01:20.886
because they would have killed each other
trying to fuck this poor woman.

965
01:01:20.969 --> 01:01:22.429
You know what I mean?

966
01:01:22.513 --> 01:01:26.392
And on the other island ,
there would be 99 women, 99 babies,

967
01:01:26.475 --> 01:01:28.310
and no more men

968
01:01:28.394 --> 01:01:31.105
because they would have all
gotten together and eaten him alive.

969
01:01:31.188 --> 01:01:34.608
Oh, yeah? Yeah?
See, I think there's something to that.

970
01:01:34.691 --> 01:01:38.570
I think on some level, women don't mind
the idea of destroying a man.

971
01:01:38.654 --> 01:01:42.866
Like, I was once walking down the street
with my ex-girlfriend , right?

972
01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:47.788
We just walked by these real ―
four thuggy-looking guys next to a Camaro.

973
01:01:47.871 --> 01:01:51.166
And , uh, one of 'em sure enough
says, "Hey, baby, nice ass."

974
01:01:51.250 --> 01:01:54.920
So I'm like, "All right. No big deal.
I'm not gonna get uptight about this."

975
01:01:55.003 --> 01:01:58.132
- Yeah, plus, you know, there were four of them.
- Yeah, exactly. There's four of 'em.

976
01:01:58.215 --> 01:02:00.217
But she turns around ,
she says, "Fuck you, dickheads!"

977
01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:03.429
And I'm like,
"Okay, wait a minute here." Right?

978
01:02:03.512 --> 01:02:06.056
They're not gonna come and kick <i>her</i> ass.
Know what I mean?

979
01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:09.560
So who just got pushed to the front line
on that one? You see what I'm saying?

980
01:02:09.643 --> 01:02:12.521
I mean, women say they hate it
if you're all territorial and protective,

981
01:02:12.604 --> 01:02:16.984
but if it suits them , then they'll tell you
you're being all unmanly or wimpy.

982
01:02:17.067 --> 01:02:21.905
You know what? I don't think women
really wants to destroy men. And if ―

983
01:02:21.989 --> 01:02:24.867
Even if they want to, they don't succeed.
You know what I mean?

984
01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:27.119
I'm sure even men are destroying women ―

985
01:02:27.202 --> 01:02:30.330
or are capable of destroying women
much more than women.

986
01:02:30.414 --> 01:02:32.833
Well, anyway ―
It's depressing. You know what?

987
01:02:32.916 --> 01:02:35.544
- What? You wanna stop talking about this?
- Yeah. I hate it.

988
01:02:35.627 --> 01:02:38.464
- Okay. Well, over it.
- You know, man-woman. There's no end to this.

989
01:02:38.547 --> 01:02:41.300
- Like ― You know.
- It's like a skipping record , you know?

990
01:02:41.383 --> 01:02:42.426
(laughs) Yeah.

991
01:02:42.509 --> 01:02:45.596
Every couple's been having
this conversation forever.

992
01:02:45.679 --> 01:02:48.307
And nobody came up with anything.

993
01:03:04.239 --> 01:03:06.867
I saw a documentary on that.
It's a birth dance.

994
01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:09.036
- A birth dance.
- Yeah.

995
01:03:36.939 --> 01:03:39.066
- Should I give her some money?
- Yeah.

996
01:03:39.149 --> 01:03:42.236
JESSE: Everything that's interesting
costs a little bit of money.

997
01:03:43.987 --> 01:03:48.617
So a birth dance, huh?
Looked a little bit like a mating dance to me.

998
01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:51.662
No, but really,
women used it when giving birth.

999
01:03:51.745 --> 01:03:54.206
In some part of the world ,
they still do it.

1000
01:03:54.289 --> 01:03:55.499
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1001
01:03:55.582 --> 01:03:58.001
The woman in labor enters a tent,

1002
01:03:58.085 --> 01:04:00.921
and the women of her tribe
surround her and dance,

1003
01:04:01.004 --> 01:04:03.340
and they encourage the birthing woman
to dance with them

1004
01:04:03.423 --> 01:04:05.717
-so as to make the birth less painful.
- Yeah?

1005
01:04:05.801 --> 01:04:09.096
And when the baby's born,
they all dance in celebration.

1006
01:04:09.179 --> 01:04:12.057
Wow. I don't think my mom
would've gone for that.

1007
01:04:13.058 --> 01:04:15.686
CELINE: I like the idea of dancing
as a common function in life,

1008
01:04:15.769 --> 01:04:17.604
something everybody participates in.

1009
01:04:17.688 --> 01:04:20.107
Mmm. I know. I heard about this old guy

1010
01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:23.193
who, uh, was watching
some young people dance,

1011
01:04:23.277 --> 01:04:25.112
and he said , "How beautiful.

1012
01:04:25.195 --> 01:04:28.031
They're trying to shake off their genitals
and become angels."

1013
01:04:28.115 --> 01:04:30.534
- I like that.
- All right, one question. Back there ―

1014
01:04:30.617 --> 01:04:34.288
When the women are dancing
and being all spiritual and stuff, right?

1015
01:04:34.371 --> 01:04:36.957
Where are the men?
Are we out food gathering?

1016
01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:40.085
Are we not invited?
Y'all don't need us? What?

1017
01:04:40.168 --> 01:04:42.588
Men are lucky we don't bite off their head
after mating.

1018
01:04:42.671 --> 01:04:45.465
Certain insects do that, you know?
Like spiders and stuff?

1019
01:04:45.549 --> 01:04:47.384
- Mm-hmm.
- We at least let you live.

1020
01:04:47.467 --> 01:04:49.094
- What are you complaining about?
- Yeah.

1021
01:04:49.177 --> 01:04:52.264
See, you're officially kidding ,
but there's somethin' to that.

1022
01:04:52.347 --> 01:04:54.641
- You keep bringing stuff like that up.
- What?

1023
01:04:54.725 --> 01:04:57.144
- Yeah!
- No, no, no. Wait a minute.

1024
01:04:57.227 --> 01:04:58.854
Talking seriously here.

1025
01:04:58.937 --> 01:05:01.481
I mean, I always feel this pressure

1026
01:05:01.565 --> 01:05:04.192
of being a strong and independent icon
of womanhood

1027
01:05:04.276 --> 01:05:09.865
and not making ― making look like
my whole life is revolving around some guy.

1028
01:05:09.948 --> 01:05:14.286
But... loving someone, and being loved ,

1029
01:05:14.369 --> 01:05:16.371
means so much to me.

1030
01:05:17.289 --> 01:05:19.374
I always make fun of it and stuff,

1031
01:05:20.459 --> 01:05:25.255
but isn't everything we dream in life
a way to be loved a little more?

1032
01:05:27.591 --> 01:05:29.718
Yeah.

1033
01:05:29.801 --> 01:05:31.595
I don't know.

1034
01:05:31.678 --> 01:05:33.889
Sometimes I dream

1035
01:05:33.972 --> 01:05:36.933
about being a good father
and a good husband.

1036
01:05:37.017 --> 01:05:39.728
- And sometimes that feels really close.
- Hmm.

1037
01:05:40.437 --> 01:05:42.439
But then other times,

1038
01:05:43.398 --> 01:05:45.359
it seems silly,

1039
01:05:45.442 --> 01:05:48.862
like it would , uh, ruin my whole life.

1040
01:05:49.863 --> 01:05:52.491
And it's not just a ― a fear of commitment

1041
01:05:52.574 --> 01:05:55.160
or that I'm incapable of caring or loving ,

1042
01:05:55.243 --> 01:05:57.746
because... I can.

1043
01:05:58.664 --> 01:06:02.417
It's just that...
If I'm totally honest with myself,

1044
01:06:03.168 --> 01:06:07.464
I think I'd rather die knowing
that I was really good at something ,

1045
01:06:07.547 --> 01:06:10.634
that I had excelled in some way.

1046
01:06:10.717 --> 01:06:16.139
You know? Than that I'd just been
in a nice, caring relationship.

1047
01:06:18.558 --> 01:06:20.477
Yeah.

1048
01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:23.480
But... I had worked for this older man,

1049
01:06:23.563 --> 01:06:27.025
and once he told me
that he had spent all of his life

1050
01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:29.069
thinking about his career and his work.

1051
01:06:29.152 --> 01:06:32.114
And... he was 52,
and it suddenly struck him...

1052
01:06:32.864 --> 01:06:35.992
that he had never really given
anything of himself.

1053
01:06:36.076 --> 01:06:38.578
His life was for no one and nothing.

1054
01:06:39.996 --> 01:06:42.207
He was almost crying saying that.

1055
01:06:45.377 --> 01:06:47.963
You know, I believe
if there's any kind of God ,

1056
01:06:48.046 --> 01:06:50.173
it wouldn't be in any of us ―

1057
01:06:50.257 --> 01:06:52.175
not you or me.

1058
01:06:53.176 --> 01:06:55.345
But just this little space in between.

1059
01:06:58.598 --> 01:07:01.393
If there's any kind of magic in this world ,

1060
01:07:01.476 --> 01:07:05.272
it must be in the attempt of understanding
someone, sharing something.

1061
01:07:07.983 --> 01:07:10.360
I know. It's almost impossible to succeed.

1062
01:07:10.444 --> 01:07:13.488
But... who cares, really?

1063
01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:17.576
The answer must be in the attempt.

1064
01:07:36.386 --> 01:07:38.263
(chattering)

1065
01:07:42.976 --> 01:07:45.604
(man speaking German)

1066
01:07:48.899 --> 01:07:51.526
(speaking German)

1067
01:07:57.032 --> 01:07:59.326
(speaking German)

1068
01:08:10.879 --> 01:08:13.465
(speaking German)

1069
01:08:25.894 --> 01:08:28.313
I really think this <i>is</i>
a civilization in decline.

1070
01:08:28.396 --> 01:08:30.023
- Look at the service.
- The service?

1071
01:08:30.106 --> 01:08:33.360
Where is the waitress? In New York,
this person would be out of a job.

1072
01:08:33.443 --> 01:08:35.570
(speaking German)

1073
01:08:41.576 --> 01:08:44.120
Okay. Now I'm gonna call
my best friend in Paris,

1074
01:08:44.204 --> 01:08:46.748
who I'm supposed to
have lunch with in eight hours.

1075
01:08:46.832 --> 01:08:48.917
- Okay?
- Okay.

1076
01:08:50.126 --> 01:08:54.297
Dring. Dring. Dring. Dring.

1077
01:08:54.381 --> 01:08:57.425
- Dring. Dring. Pick up!
- What?

1078
01:08:57.509 --> 01:09:00.554
- Pick up the phone.
- Uh, oh, hello?

1079
01:09:00.637 --> 01:09:03.098
<i>- Allô? Vani' c'est Celine.</i>
- Mm-hmm?

1080
01:09:03.181 --> 01:09:04.641
- Ah!
<i>- Comment ça va?</i>

1081
01:09:06.101 --> 01:09:08.395
<i>Ça va bien. Et toi?</i>

1082
01:09:09.729 --> 01:09:11.857
-(speaking French rapidly)
- Ah ―

1083
01:09:12.774 --> 01:09:16.486
I-I've been workin' on my English recently.
You wanna talk in English? Just for laughs?

1084
01:09:17.070 --> 01:09:19.364
- Yeah, okay. That's a good idea.
-(laughs)

1085
01:09:19.447 --> 01:09:24.327
Um , I don't think I'm gonna be able
to make it for lunch today. I'm sorry.

1086
01:09:24.411 --> 01:09:28.832
I ― I met a guy on the train,
and I got off with him in Vienna.

1087
01:09:28.915 --> 01:09:32.210
- We're still there.
- Are you crazy?

1088
01:09:33.211 --> 01:09:35.005
Probably.

1089
01:09:35.088 --> 01:09:37.090
Wh-What, he's Austrian? He's from there?

1090
01:09:37.173 --> 01:09:39.926
No, no, no, no. He's passing through here too.
He's American.

1091
01:09:40.010 --> 01:09:42.053
He's going back home tomorrow morning.

1092
01:09:42.137 --> 01:09:44.598
Why'd you get off the train with him?

1093
01:09:44.681 --> 01:09:47.017
Well, he convinced me.

1094
01:09:48.143 --> 01:09:49.936
I mean, actually, I was ―

1095
01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:54.190
I was ready to get off the train with him
after talking to him a short while.

1096
01:09:54.274 --> 01:09:56.359
He was so sweet, I couldn't help it.

1097
01:09:57.652 --> 01:09:59.279
We were in the lounge car,

1098
01:09:59.362 --> 01:10:03.491
and he begin to talk about him as a little boy
seeing his great-grandmother's ghost.

1099
01:10:04.868 --> 01:10:07.495
I think that's when I fell for him.

1100
01:10:08.204 --> 01:10:11.708
Just the idea of this little boy
with all those beautiful dreams.

1101
01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:16.129
- He trapped me.
- Mm-hmm.

1102
01:10:18.298 --> 01:10:20.133
And he's so cute.

1103
01:10:20.216 --> 01:10:24.012
He has beautiful blue eyes,
nice pink lips.

1104
01:10:25.263 --> 01:10:29.351
Greasy hair! (laughing) I love it.

1105
01:10:29.434 --> 01:10:32.020
He's kind of tall
and he's a little clumsy.

1106
01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:36.650
I like to feel his eyes on me
when I look away.

1107
01:10:41.279 --> 01:10:44.532
He kind of kisses like an adolescent.
It's so cute.

1108
01:10:44.616 --> 01:10:46.993
- What?
- Yeah, we kissed.

1109
01:10:47.077 --> 01:10:49.037
It was so adorable.

1110
01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:52.248
As the night went on,
I began to like him more and more.

1111
01:10:54.084 --> 01:10:55.919
But I'm afraid he's scared of me.

1112
01:10:56.002 --> 01:11:00.215
I told him the story about the woman
that kills her ex-boyfriend and stuff.

1113
01:11:00.298 --> 01:11:02.133
He must be scared to death.

1114
01:11:02.217 --> 01:11:05.345
He must be thinking
I'm this manipulative, mean woman.

1115
01:11:07.597 --> 01:11:10.266
I just hope he doesn't
feel that way about me.

1116
01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:12.852
Because you know me.
I'm the most harmless person.

1117
01:11:14.771 --> 01:11:17.691
The only person
I could really hurt is myself.

1118
01:11:18.608 --> 01:11:20.610
I don't think he's scared of you.

1119
01:11:20.694 --> 01:11:23.738
- I think he's crazy about you.
- Really?

1120
01:11:23.822 --> 01:11:26.741
I've known you a long time,
and I got a good feeling.

1121
01:11:26.825 --> 01:11:29.035
You gonna see him again?

1122
01:11:30.328 --> 01:11:32.247
We haven't talked about that yet.

1123
01:11:37.752 --> 01:11:39.963
Okay. It's your turn.
You call your friend.

1124
01:11:40.046 --> 01:11:42.007
- Okay?
- Uh ― All right, all right.

1125
01:11:42.090 --> 01:11:44.175
Um ― Uh ―

1126
01:11:44.926 --> 01:11:49.431
Bring , bring , bring. I usually get
this guy's answering machine. Brrring!

1127
01:11:51.224 --> 01:11:52.892
Hi, dude. What's up?

1128
01:11:52.976 --> 01:11:55.979
- Uh ― Hey, Frank, how ya been?
-(laughing)

1129
01:11:56.062 --> 01:11:57.814
Glad you're home.

1130
01:11:57.897 --> 01:12:01.067
Cool. Yeah. So how was Madrid?

1131
01:12:01.151 --> 01:12:03.486
Uh, Madrid sucked.

1132
01:12:03.570 --> 01:12:07.198
Uh, you know, Lisa and I
had our long-overdue meltdown.

1133
01:12:07.907 --> 01:12:09.909
Oh, too bad. I told you, no?

1134
01:12:09.993 --> 01:12:13.038
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
The long-distance thing just never works.

1135
01:12:13.121 --> 01:12:15.373
I was only in Madrid for a couple days.

1136
01:12:15.457 --> 01:12:17.834
And I got a cheaper flight out of Vienna,

1137
01:12:17.917 --> 01:12:19.919
but, uh,

1138
01:12:20.003 --> 01:12:22.047
you know, it really
wasn't that much cheaper.

1139
01:12:22.130 --> 01:12:25.842
I just, uh ―
I couldn't go home right away.

1140
01:12:25.925 --> 01:12:27.761
I didn't wanna see anybody I knew.

1141
01:12:27.844 --> 01:12:30.305
I just wanted to be a ghost,
completely anonymous.

1142
01:12:32.348 --> 01:12:33.975
- So are you okay now?
- Yeah.

1143
01:12:34.059 --> 01:12:37.145
Yeah. No, no. Yeah!
I'm great. I'm great. That's the thing.

1144
01:12:37.228 --> 01:12:38.563
I'm rapturous.

1145
01:12:39.355 --> 01:12:40.982
And I'll tell you why.

1146
01:12:41.066 --> 01:12:43.985
I met somebody on my last night in Europe.
Can you believe that?

1147
01:12:44.069 --> 01:12:46.863
- That's incredible.
- I know. I know.

1148
01:12:46.946 --> 01:12:50.325
And you know how they say we're all
each other's demons and angels?

1149
01:12:51.326 --> 01:12:54.287
Well, she was literally a Botticelli angel,

1150
01:12:54.370 --> 01:12:57.582
just tellin' me that
everything was gonna be okay.

1151
01:13:00.251 --> 01:13:01.753
How did you meet?

1152
01:13:03.254 --> 01:13:05.131
- On the train.
- Hmm.

1153
01:13:05.215 --> 01:13:09.761
She was sittin' next to this very weird couple
that started fighting , so she had to move.

1154
01:13:09.844 --> 01:13:12.013
She sat right across the aisle from me.

1155
01:13:12.097 --> 01:13:14.224
So we started to talk.

1156
01:13:14.307 --> 01:13:16.643
And , uh, she didn't like me much at first.

1157
01:13:16.726 --> 01:13:19.437
She's super-smart, very passionate,

1158
01:13:19.521 --> 01:13:22.398
um , and beautiful.

1159
01:13:23.817 --> 01:13:26.694
And I was so unsure of myself.

1160
01:13:26.778 --> 01:13:29.155
I thought everything I said
sounded so stupid.

1161
01:13:31.241 --> 01:13:34.369
Aw, man, I wouldn't worry about that.

1162
01:13:34.452 --> 01:13:37.247
- Nah.
- Nah, I'm sure she was not judging you.

1163
01:13:37.956 --> 01:13:40.208
No. And by the way,
she sat next to you, no?

1164
01:13:40.291 --> 01:13:42.669
- I'm sure she did it in purpose.
- Oh, yeah?

1165
01:13:42.752 --> 01:13:45.213
Yeah. (laughs)

1166
01:13:47.215 --> 01:13:50.176
Us men are so stupid.
We don't understand anything about women.

1167
01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:52.095
Mm-mmm.

1168
01:13:52.178 --> 01:13:54.848
They act kind of strange,
the little I know of them.

1169
01:13:55.431 --> 01:13:56.933
Don't they?

1170
01:13:58.351 --> 01:13:59.853
Yeah.

1171
01:14:03.773 --> 01:14:07.777
I feel like this is some dream world
we're in, you know?

1172
01:14:07.861 --> 01:14:09.821
Yeah, it's so weird.

1173
01:14:09.904 --> 01:14:13.825
It's like our time together is just ours.
It's our own creation.

1174
01:14:14.784 --> 01:14:17.871
It must be like I'm in your dream
and you're in mine or something.

1175
01:14:17.954 --> 01:14:19.247
Mm-hmm.

1176
01:14:19.330 --> 01:14:23.418
And what's so cool is that this whole evening ,
all our time together,

1177
01:14:23.501 --> 01:14:25.879
shouldn't officially be happening.

1178
01:14:25.962 --> 01:14:29.174
Yeah, I know. Maybe that's why
this feels so otherworldly.

1179
01:14:31.593 --> 01:14:34.762
But then the morning comes
and we turn into pumpkins, right?

1180
01:14:34.846 --> 01:14:37.599
- Aaah!
-(laughing) I know.

1181
01:14:38.474 --> 01:14:43.646
But at this time, I think you're supposed to
produce the glass slipper and see if it fits.

1182
01:14:43.730 --> 01:14:46.024
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1183
01:14:46.107 --> 01:14:47.734
It'll fit.

1184
01:15:05.793 --> 01:15:08.922
JESSE: This friend of mine had a kid ,
and it was a home birth,

1185
01:15:09.005 --> 01:15:11.257
so he was there
helping out and everything.

1186
01:15:11.341 --> 01:15:14.344
But he said at that profound
moment of birth ―

1187
01:15:14.427 --> 01:15:19.224
Uh, he was watching his child
experiencing life for the first time,

1188
01:15:19.307 --> 01:15:21.684
trying to take its first breath.

1189
01:15:21.768 --> 01:15:25.396
All he could think about was
that he was lookin' at somethin'

1190
01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:27.690
that was gonna die someday.

1191
01:15:27.774 --> 01:15:30.401
He just couldn't get it out of his head.

1192
01:15:30.485 --> 01:15:34.364
And I think that's so true.
You know, everything is so finite.

1193
01:15:34.447 --> 01:15:37.408
I mean, but ― but don't you think
that's what, um ,

1194
01:15:37.492 --> 01:15:40.995
makes our time and specific moments
so important?

1195
01:15:41.079 --> 01:15:44.249
Yeah, I know.
It's the same for us tonight though.

1196
01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:51.172
After tomorrow morning , we're probably
never gonna see each other again, right?

1197
01:15:53.091 --> 01:15:55.301
You don't think
we'll ever see each other again?

1198
01:15:57.762 --> 01:15:59.264
What do you think?

1199
01:16:00.682 --> 01:16:03.518
Well ― Um ―

1200
01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:07.772
Gosh, I don't know. Uh ―

1201
01:16:07.855 --> 01:16:10.566
- I mean, I hadn't planned another trip to ―
- Uh, me too.

1202
01:16:10.650 --> 01:16:13.778
I mean, I live in Paris.
You live in the US. I totally understand ―

1203
01:16:13.861 --> 01:16:16.155
I'd hate to make you fly.
You hate to fly, right?

1204
01:16:16.239 --> 01:16:18.366
I'm not so scared of flying.

1205
01:16:19.450 --> 01:16:23.371
- I mean, I could.
- Well, if you were gonna come to the US

1206
01:16:23.454 --> 01:16:25.832
or if, you know ― I mean, if I ―

1207
01:16:25.915 --> 01:16:29.252
Or you know, I mean,
I could come back here.

1208
01:16:29.335 --> 01:16:31.462
What? What?

1209
01:16:31.546 --> 01:16:34.382
No, let's just be rational adults
about this.

1210
01:16:35.466 --> 01:16:37.510
We ―

1211
01:16:37.593 --> 01:16:39.595
Maybe we should try something different.

1212
01:16:39.679 --> 01:16:42.849
I mean, it's not so bad
if tonight is our only night, right?

1213
01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:46.311
People always exchange
phone numbers, addresses.

1214
01:16:46.394 --> 01:16:49.230
They end up writing once,
calling each other once or twice.

1215
01:16:49.314 --> 01:16:51.232
Right. Fizzles out.

1216
01:16:51.316 --> 01:16:53.860
Yeah. I mean, I don't want that.
I hate that.

1217
01:16:54.861 --> 01:16:56.487
I hate that too. Yeah.

1218
01:16:57.071 --> 01:17:00.366
Why do you think everybody thinks relationships
are supposed to last forever anyway?

1219
01:17:00.450 --> 01:17:02.493
Yeah, why? It's stupid.

1220
01:17:04.579 --> 01:17:07.206
But you think tonight's it, huh?

1221
01:17:07.290 --> 01:17:10.877
I mean, that... tonight's our only night?

1222
01:17:12.879 --> 01:17:15.423
It's the only way, no?

Well, all right.

01:21:13.953 --> 01:21:17.957
like traveling or staying up all night
and watching the sunrise,

1283

Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1298
01:22:19.644 --> 01:22:20.978
Hmm?

1299
01:22:21.062 --> 01:22:24.899
It's just usually, it's myself
that I wish I could get away from.

1300
01:22:26.108 --> 01:22:28.319
Seriously, think about this.

1301
01:22:28.402 --> 01:22:32.156
I have never been anywhere
that I haven't been.

1302
01:22:32.239 --> 01:22:33.240
Hmm.

1303
01:22:33.324 --> 01:22:37.953
I've never, uh, had a kiss
when I wasn't one of the kissers.

1304
01:22:38.037 --> 01:22:42.667
You know, I've never, um , gone to the movies
when I wasn't there in the audience.

1305
01:22:43.668 --> 01:22:47.838
I never been out bowling if I wasn't there,
you know, makin' some stupid joke.

1306
01:22:47.922 --> 01:22:50.966
I think that's why so many people
hate themselves. Seriously.

1307
01:22:51.050 --> 01:22:55.680
It's just that they are sick to death
of being around themselves.

1308
01:22:56.472 --> 01:23:00.142
Let's say you and I
were together all the time.

1309
01:23:00.226 --> 01:23:02.561
You'd start to hate
a lot of my mannerisms...

1310
01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:07.942
and the way, uh ― the way every time
that we would have people over, uh,

1311
01:23:08.776 --> 01:23:11.529
I'd be insecure
and I'd get a little too drunk.

1312
01:23:11.612 --> 01:23:17.952
Or, uh, the way I tell the same stupid ,
pseudo-intellectual story again and again.

1313
01:23:19.745 --> 01:23:22.373
You see, I've heard all those stories.

1314
01:23:22.456 --> 01:23:24.959
So, of course I'm sick of myself.

1315
01:23:26.419 --> 01:23:27.670
But...

1316
01:23:29.213 --> 01:23:31.173
being with you, uh,

1317
01:23:32.967 --> 01:23:35.344
has made me feel like I was somebody else.

1318
01:23:37.221 --> 01:23:41.183
And the only other way
to lose yourself like that is, um ,

1319
01:23:42.184 --> 01:23:46.480
you know, dancing or alcohol or...

1320
01:23:47.481 --> 01:23:49.817
drugs and stuff like that.

1321
01:23:52.778 --> 01:23:55.156
Fucking?

1322
01:23:55.239 --> 01:23:58.868
- Fu ― Fucking. Yeah. That's one way. Yeah.
- Yeah?

1323
01:24:12.757 --> 01:24:14.717
Do you know what I want?

1324
01:24:15.801 --> 01:24:17.219
What?

1325
01:24:20.347 --> 01:24:22.141
To be kissed.

1326
01:24:25.352 --> 01:24:27.188
Well, I can do that.

1327
01:24:40.910 --> 01:24:42.953
Wait. Wait.

1328
01:24:43.037 --> 01:24:46.248
(sighs heavily)

1329
01:24:46.332 --> 01:24:48.375
I have to say something stupid.

1330
01:24:49.543 --> 01:24:50.961
All right.

1331
01:24:52.379 --> 01:24:55.216
- It's very stupid.
- Okay.

1332
01:24:57.134 --> 01:24:59.345
I don't think we should sleep together.

1333
01:25:01.597 --> 01:25:05.142
I mean, I want to, but since we're
never gonna see each other again,

1334
01:25:06.268 --> 01:25:08.270
it'll make me feel bad.

1335
01:25:09.230 --> 01:25:11.899
I'll wonder who else you're with.
I'll miss you.

1336
01:25:17.321 --> 01:25:19.865
I know. It's not very adult.

1337
01:25:19.949 --> 01:25:22.535
Maybe it's a female thing.
I can't help it.

1338
01:25:23.452 --> 01:25:25.454
Let's see each other again.

1339
01:25:27.581 --> 01:25:31.418
No, I don't want you to break our vow
just so you can get laid.

1340
01:25:32.378 --> 01:25:35.339
I don't wanna just get laid.
I want to, um ―

1341
01:25:35.422 --> 01:25:38.717
I mean ― I mean, I think we should.

1342
01:25:40.219 --> 01:25:42.388
I mean, we die in the morning , right?

1343
01:25:43.681 --> 01:25:46.725
- I think we should.
- No. Then it's like some male fantasy.

1344
01:25:46.809 --> 01:25:50.354
Meet a French girl on the train,
fuck her and never see her again.

1345
01:25:50.437 --> 01:25:53.065
This great story to tell.
I don't wanna be a great story.

1346
01:25:53.148 --> 01:25:56.110
I don't want this great evening
to just have been for that.

1347
01:25:56.193 --> 01:25:57.570
- Okay.
- Okay?

1348
01:25:57.653 --> 01:26:01.073
Okay. We don't have to have sex.
It's not a big deal.

1349
01:26:03.450 --> 01:26:04.952
Okay.

1350
01:26:12.001 --> 01:26:14.169
You don't wanna see me again?

1351
01:26:15.421 --> 01:26:17.256
No, of course I do. Listen.

1352
01:26:17.339 --> 01:26:19.800
If somebody gave me the choice right now

1353
01:26:19.884 --> 01:26:22.511
of to never see you again or to marry you,

1354
01:26:22.595 --> 01:26:24.346
I would marry you, all right?

1355
01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:26.473
And maybe that's
a lot of romantic bullshit,

1356
01:26:26.557 --> 01:26:28.893
but people have gotten married
for a lot less.

1357
01:26:32.688 --> 01:26:35.065
Actually ―

1358
01:26:35.149 --> 01:26:40.070
(sighs) I think I decided I wanted to sleep
with you when we got off the train.

1359
01:26:43.908 --> 01:26:46.327
Now that we've talked so much,
I don't know anymore.

1360
01:26:46.410 --> 01:26:49.163
- Oh, God.
-(laughing) What?

1361
01:26:57.671 --> 01:27:00.132
Why do I make everything so complicated?

1362
01:27:00.215 --> 01:27:02.051
I don't know.

1363
01:27:33.999 --> 01:27:36.627

1364
01:27:38.337 --> 01:27:40.547

1365
01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:49.890
♪♪ (continues)

1366
01:28:03.529 --> 01:28:07.658
JESSE: What do you think's the first thing
you're gonna do when you get back to Paris?

1367
01:28:07.741 --> 01:28:11.036
Call my parents. What about you?

1368
01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:15.416
I don't know. I'll probably go pick up my dog.
He's stayin' with a friend of mine.

1369
01:28:15.499 --> 01:28:17.626
- You have a dog? I love dogs.
- Yeah. You do?

1370
01:28:17.710 --> 01:28:20.379
- Yeah.
- Oh. Oh, shit.

1371
01:28:20.462 --> 01:28:22.089
- What?
- Oh!

1372
01:28:22.172 --> 01:28:24.758
I don't know. We're back in real time.

1373
01:28:24.842 --> 01:28:26.927
I know. I hate that.

1374
01:28:27.011 --> 01:28:28.971
What is that?

1375
01:28:30.472 --> 01:28:32.683
Sounds like a harpsichord.

1376
01:28:32.766 --> 01:28:37.062
- Oh, check that out.
-(whispers) Somebody's playing.

1377
01:28:37.146 --> 01:28:38.647
Shh.

1378
01:28:43.068 --> 01:28:44.570
(whispers) That's cool.

1379
01:28:59.460 --> 01:29:00.961
What?

1380
01:29:03.255 --> 01:29:05.674
JESSE: You ever danced to a harpsichord?

1381
01:29:05.758 --> 01:29:07.176
Of course.

1382
01:29:10.888 --> 01:29:14.099
- Oh, wow.
- What?

1383
01:29:14.183 --> 01:29:17.936
Uh ― I'm gonna take your picture...

1384
01:29:19.313 --> 01:29:21.231
so I never forget you

1385
01:29:21.315 --> 01:29:24.777
or, uh ― or all this.

1386
01:29:25.569 --> 01:29:27.279
Okay. Me too.

1387
01:30:13.617 --> 01:30:17.538
(bell tolling)

1388
01:30:25.587 --> 01:30:29.049
JESSE: "The years shall run like rabbits."

1389
01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:33.262
What?

1390
01:30:34.763 --> 01:30:36.765
Nothin'. Nothin'.

1391
01:30:37.975 --> 01:30:42.646
I have this, uh, recording of Dylan Thomas

1392
01:30:42.729 --> 01:30:44.898
reading a W. H. Auden poem.

1393
01:30:44.982 --> 01:30:47.234
He's got a great voice.

1394
01:30:47.317 --> 01:30:49.236
He just ―

1395
01:30:49.319 --> 01:30:51.947
- It's like ―
- Hmm? What?

1396
01:30:52.030 --> 01:30:57.411
(Welsh accent) "All the clocks
in the city began to whir and chime.

1397
01:30:57.494 --> 01:31:00.205
Oh, let not time deceive you.

1398
01:31:00.289 --> 01:31:02.958
You cannot conquer time.

1399
01:31:03.041 --> 01:31:05.252
In headaches and in worry,

1400
01:31:05.335 --> 01:31:08.338
vaguely life leaks away,

1401
01:31:09.089 --> 01:31:11.175
and time will have his fancy

1402
01:31:11.258 --> 01:31:13.927
tomorrow or today."

1403
01:31:14.011 --> 01:31:16.763
-(chuckles)
- Somethin' like that.

1404
01:31:16.847 --> 01:31:18.348
It's good.

1405
01:31:25.647 --> 01:31:29.651
When you talked earlier
about after a few years

1406
01:31:29.735 --> 01:31:31.737
how a couple
would begin to hate each other

1407
01:31:31.820 --> 01:31:36.533
by anticipating their reactions
or getting tired of their mannerisms,

1408
01:31:37.618 --> 01:31:40.829
I think it would be the opposite for me.

1409
01:31:40.913 --> 01:31:45.417
I think I can really fall in love
when I know everything about someone ―

1410
01:31:46.710 --> 01:31:50.714
The way he's gonna part his hair,
which shirt he's gonna wear that day,

1411
01:31:50.797 --> 01:31:54.551
knowing the exact story
he'd tell in a given situation.

1412
01:31:56.803 --> 01:31:59.306
I'm sure that's when I know
I'm really in love.

1413
01:32:20.911 --> 01:32:22.955
- Hey, guess what.
- What?

1414
01:32:23.747 --> 01:32:25.874
We didn't go to those guys' play.

1415
01:32:25.958 --> 01:32:27.376
- Play?
- Yeah.

1416
01:32:27.459 --> 01:32:28.877
- The cow?
- Yeah.

1417
01:32:28.961 --> 01:32:32.756
(laughs) Oh, yeah, we didn't.
Oh, no. We missed it.

1418
01:32:46.895 --> 01:32:49.856
(man speaking German on PA)

1419
01:32:58.657 --> 01:33:01.118
Okay. You know what bus
you're taking to the airport, right?

1420
01:33:01.201 --> 01:33:03.203
- Yeah, no problem.
- I should get on this one.

1421
01:33:03.287 --> 01:33:05.330
- Right here? You wanna get on that one?
- Yeah.

1422
01:33:05.414 --> 01:33:07.291
Um ―

1423
01:33:07.374 --> 01:33:09.209
Okay.

1424
01:33:09.293 --> 01:33:11.837
- I guess this is it, no?
- Yeah.

1425
01:33:12.587 --> 01:33:14.214
Um , I really ―

1426
01:33:15.465 --> 01:33:18.135
-(departure bell rings)
- I-I ―

1427
01:33:18.218 --> 01:33:20.137
I mean ― You know.

1428
01:33:20.220 --> 01:33:22.514
- Yeah, I know. Me too.
-(man speaking on PA)

1429
01:33:24.057 --> 01:33:25.559
I ―

1430
01:33:26.518 --> 01:33:28.603
My ― Yeah.

1431
01:33:28.687 --> 01:33:31.648
Have a great life.
Have fun with everything you're gonna do.

1432
01:33:31.732 --> 01:33:34.276
All right, all right.
Good luck with school and all that.

1433
01:33:34.359 --> 01:33:35.861
Okay.

1434
01:33:35.944 --> 01:33:38.155
Well, I hate this.

1435
01:33:38.238 --> 01:33:40.657
- Me too. The train is about to leave.
- Yeah.

1436
01:33:48.623 --> 01:33:53.170
Listen. All this bullshit we were talkin' about ―
about not seeing each other again?

1437
01:33:53.253 --> 01:33:55.547
- I don't wanna do that.
- I don't wanna do that either.

1438
01:33:55.630 --> 01:33:58.008
- You don't either?
- I was waiting for you to say ―

1439
01:33:58.091 --> 01:34:01.219
- Why didn't you say something?
- I was afraid maybe you didn't want to see me.

1440
01:34:01.303 --> 01:34:03.930
Listen, what do you wanna do?

1441
01:34:04.014 --> 01:34:07.225
Maybe ― Maybe we should meet here
in five years or something.

1442
01:34:07.309 --> 01:34:09.770
All right, all right.
Five years? Five years? That's a long time.

1443
01:34:09.853 --> 01:34:13.065
Yes, it's awful.
It's like a sociological experiment.

1444
01:34:13.148 --> 01:34:15.317
- How 'bout one year?
- One year. All right. All ―

1445
01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:18.320
- One ― How 'bout six months?
- Six months?

1446
01:34:18.403 --> 01:34:20.155
- Yeah.
- It's gonna be freezing.

1447
01:34:20.238 --> 01:34:21.448
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

1448
01:34:21.531 --> 01:34:23.742
Who cares? We come here,
we go somewhere else.

1449
01:34:23.825 --> 01:34:25.827
Okay.

1450
01:34:25.911 --> 01:34:28.914
Uh, six months from now or last night?

1451
01:34:29.498 --> 01:34:32.834
- Um ― Last night. Six months from last night ―
- Okay.

1452
01:34:32.918 --> 01:34:35.670
Which was, uh, June 16.

1453
01:34:35.754 --> 01:34:40.342
So, uh, track nine, six months
from now at 6:00 at night.

1454
01:34:40.425 --> 01:34:42.427
- De ― December.
- December, yeah.

1455
01:34:42.511 --> 01:34:45.639
It's a train ride for you. I gotta fly
all the way over here and shit like that.

1456
01:34:45.722 --> 01:34:47.307
But I'm gonna be here.

1457
01:34:47.391 --> 01:34:49.768
- Okay, me too.
- All right.

1458
01:34:51.770 --> 01:34:54.272
- And we're not gonna call, write or ―
- Nah, it's depressing.

1459
01:34:54.356 --> 01:34:56.566
- Yeah. Okay.
- All right.

1460
01:34:57.984 --> 01:35:01.613
All right. Your train's gonna leave.
Say good-bye.

1461
01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:04.282
Bye.

1462
01:35:04.366 --> 01:35:05.700
Good-bye.
