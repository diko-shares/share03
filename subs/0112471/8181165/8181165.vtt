No.

11
00:04:25.202 --> 00:04:29.339
Supposedly, men lose their ability to hear high-pitched sounds...

12
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.275
...and women lose hearing in the low end.

13
00:04:32.276 --> 00:04:34.344
I guess they nullify each other.

14
00:04:34.345 --> 00:04:37.714
I guess. Nature's way of allowing couples to grow old together...

Oh, yeah.

18
00:04:46.557 --> 00:04:48.397

(MAN, WOMAN SPEAKING GERMAN)

21
00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:08.745
I was thinking about going to the lounge car.

22
00:05:08.746 --> 00:05:12.086
-Would you like to come with me? -Yeah.

23
00:05:33.371 --> 00:05:35.572
How do you speak such good English?

24
00:05:35.573 --> 00:05:38.775
I went to school for a summer in Los Angeles.

25
00:05:38.776 --> 00:05:41.996
-It's fine here? -Yeah, this is good.

26
00:05:45.383 --> 00:05:48.351
-Wow. -How do you speak such good English?

27
00:05:48.352 --> 00:05:50.320
Me? I'm American.

28
00:05:50.321 --> 00:05:53.601
-You're American? Are you sure? -Yeah.

29
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.010
(LAUGHING)

30
00:05:54.492 --> 00:05:57.761
No, I'm joking. I knew you were American.

31
00:05:57.762 --> 00:06:01.031
And you don't speak any other language, right?

32
00:06:01.032 --> 00:06:03.033
Yeah, yeah. I get it, I get it.

33
00:06:03.034 --> 00:06:05.435
I'm the crude, dumb, vulgar American...

34
00:06:05.436 --> 00:06:10.373
...who doesn't speak other languages, who has no culture. But I tried.

35
00:06:10.374 --> 00:06:14.210
I took French in high school. When I first got to Paris...

36
00:06:14.211 --> 00:06:16.780
...I stood in line at the metro station.

37
00:06:16.781 --> 00:06:18.801
I was practicing.

38
00:06:22.653 --> 00:06:24.193
Whatever.

39
00:06:27.358 --> 00:06:30.627
And I get up there, and I look at this woman...

40
00:06:30.628 --> 00:06:35.648
...and my mind goes blank. And I say, l need a ticket to get to....

41
00:06:35.766 --> 00:06:37.546
So anyway....

42
00:06:38.803 --> 00:06:40.937
So where are you headed?

43
00:06:40.938 --> 00:06:42.939
Well, back to Paris.

44
00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.976
-My classes start next week. -You're still in school? Where?

45
00:06:46.977 --> 00:06:48.745
La Sorbonne. You know?

46
00:06:48.746 --> 00:06:50.046
Sure.

47
00:06:51.782 --> 00:06:53.550
You're coming from Budapest?

48
00:06:53.551 --> 00:06:57.431
-I was visiting my grandmother. -Oh. How is she?

49
00:06:56.796 --> 00:06:58.276
(LAUGHING)

50
00:06:57.822 --> 00:06:59.482
She's okay.

51
00:06:59.523 --> 00:07:02.323
-She's all right? -She's fine.

52
00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.229
-How about you? Where are you going? -I'm going to Vienna.

53
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:07.564
Vienna? What's there?

54
00:07:07.565 --> 00:07:09.966
No idea. I'm flying out of there tomorrow.

55
00:07:09.967 --> 00:07:12.047
You're on holiday?

56
00:07:15.573 --> 00:07:18.374
I don't really know what I'm on. You know?

57
00:07:18.375 --> 00:07:22.812
I've just been traveling around, riding trains for two or three weeks.

58
00:07:22.813 --> 00:07:26.449
You were visiting friends or just on your own?

59
00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:28.651
I had a friend in Madrid, but....

60
00:07:28.652 --> 00:07:31.387
-Madrid, that's nice. -I got a Eurail pass...

61
00:07:31.388 --> 00:07:32.689
...is what I did.

62
00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:34.224
That's great.

63
00:07:34.225 --> 00:07:38.165
So has this trip around Europe been good for you?

64
00:07:38.796 --> 00:07:41.956
Yeah, sure. It's been.... It sucked.

65
00:07:42.366 --> 00:07:43.666
(LAUGHING , LAUGHING) What?

66
00:07:45.669 --> 00:07:47.103
It's had its....

67
00:07:47.104 --> 00:07:50.740
I'll tell you, sitting for weeks on end looking out the window...

68
00:07:50.741 --> 00:07:53.841
...has actually been kind of great.

69
00:07:54.478 --> 00:07:56.498
What do you mean?

70
00:07:57.014 --> 00:07:59.182
Well, you know, for instance...

71
00:07:59.183 --> 00:08:02.819
...you have ideas that you ordinarily wouldn't have.

72
00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:05.054
-What kind of ideas? -Want to hear one?

73
00:08:05.055 --> 00:08:07.257
-Tell me. -All right.

74
00:08:07.258 --> 00:08:10.393
I have this idea, okay, for a television show.

75
00:08:10.394 --> 00:08:13.296
Some friends of mine are cable-access producers.

76
00:08:13.297 --> 00:08:15.797
Do you know what that is?

77
00:08:16.333 --> 00:08:20.336
Anybody can produce a show real cheap, and they have to put it on.

78
00:08:20.337 --> 00:08:24.707
I have this idea for a show that lasts 24 hours a day for a year straight.

79
00:08:24.708 --> 00:08:26.142
What you do is you get...

80
00:08:26.143 --> 00:08:29.963
...365 people from cities all over the world...

81
00:08:30.681 --> 00:08:33.883
...to do these 24-hour documents of real time.

82
00:08:33.884 --> 00:08:36.624
Capturing life as it's lived.

83
00:08:36.687 --> 00:08:40.857
You know, it would start with a guy waking up in the morning...

84
00:08:40.858 --> 00:08:43.092
...and taking the long shower...

85
00:08:43.093 --> 00:08:47.030
...eating a little breakfast, making a little coffee...

86
00:08:47.031 --> 00:08:48.364
...reading the paper....

87
00:08:48.365 --> 00:08:50.633
Wait. All those mundane, boring things...

88
00:08:50.634 --> 00:08:53.870
...everybody has to do every day of their fucking life?

89
00:08:53.871 --> 00:08:56.172
I was going to say, The poetry of day-to-day life.

90
00:08:56.173 --> 00:08:58.875
You say it your way. I'll say it my way.

91
00:08:58.876 --> 00:09:01.077
-Think of it like this-- -Who's gonna watch?

92
00:09:01.078 --> 00:09:05.582
Think about it like this. Why is it that a dog sleeping in the sun...

93
00:09:05.583 --> 00:09:08.284
...is so beautiful? It is. It's beautiful.

94
00:09:08.285 --> 00:09:11.087
But a guy taking money from a bank machine...

95
00:09:11.088 --> 00:09:13.323
...Iooks like a complete moron?

96
00:09:13.324 --> 00:09:17.727
So it's like a National Geographic program, but on people.

97
00:09:17.728 --> 00:09:19.028
Yeah.

98
00:09:19.697 --> 00:09:21.777
What do you think?

99
00:09:24.868 --> 00:09:29.672
...and a three-minute sex scene where he falls asleep right after.

100
00:09:29.673 --> 00:09:32.775
Yeah, and that would be a great episode.

101
00:09:32.776 --> 00:09:35.845
(LAUGHING) People would talk about that episode.

102
00:09:35.846 --> 00:09:39.449
You and your friends could do one in Paris if you wanted.

103
00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:44.454
I don't know. The key, the thing that haunts me is the distribution.

104
00:09:44.455 --> 00:09:48.591
Getting these tapes from town to town so it would play continuously.

105
00:09:48.592 --> 00:09:53.732
Because it would have to play all the time, or it just wouldn't work.

106
00:09:54.098 --> 00:09:55.698
Thank you.

107
00:09:56.967 --> 00:09:58.387
Thanks.

108
00:09:59.803 --> 00:10:02.963
You know what? Not service oriented.

109
00:10:02.713 --> 00:10:04.193
(CHUCKLES)

110
00:10:03.874 --> 00:10:06.854
Just an observation about Europe.

111
00:10:14.551 --> 00:10:18.121
My parents never really spoke of the possibility...

112
00:10:18.122 --> 00:10:22.158
...of my falling in love or getting married or having children.

113
00:10:22.159 --> 00:10:24.227
Even as a little girl...

114
00:10:24.228 --> 00:10:27.897
...they wanted me to think as a future career as a, you know...

115
00:10:27.898 --> 00:10:31.301
...interior designer or lawyer or something like that.

116
00:10:31.302 --> 00:10:34.304
I'd say to my dad, l want to be a writer.

117
00:10:34.305 --> 00:10:36.239
And he'd say, Journalist.

118
00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:40.977
I'd say I wanted to have a refuge for stray cats. He'd say, Veterinarian.

119
00:10:40.978 --> 00:10:44.814
I'd say I wanted to be an actress. He'd say, TV newscaster.

120
00:10:44.815 --> 00:10:49.018
It was this constant conversion of my fanciful ambition into these...

121
00:10:49.019 --> 00:10:52.059
...practical moneymaking ventures.

122
00:10:53.057 --> 00:10:56.392
I had a good bullshit detector when I was a kid.

123
00:10:56.393 --> 00:10:59.095
I always knew when they were lying to me.

124
00:10:59.096 --> 00:11:01.331
By high school, I was dead set...

125
00:11:01.332 --> 00:11:05.735
...on listening to what everybody thought I should do with my life...

126
00:11:05.736 --> 00:11:08.296
...and doing the opposite.

127
00:11:08.639 --> 00:11:13.509
Nobody was ever mean about it. I just could never get very excited...

128
00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:17.146
...about other people's ambitions for my life.

129
00:11:17.147 --> 00:11:20.116
But you know what? If your parents never...

130
00:11:20.117 --> 00:11:23.986
...fully contradict you about anything and are nice and supportive...

131
00:11:23.987 --> 00:11:25.347
Right.

132
00:11:25.522 --> 00:11:28.491
...it makes it even harder to officially complain.

133
00:11:28.492 --> 00:11:32.562
Even when they're wrong, it's this passive-aggressive shit.

134
00:11:32.563 --> 00:11:34.163
You know what I mean?

135
00:11:34.164 --> 00:11:35.764
(CHUCKLING) I hate it.

136
00:11:35.833 --> 00:11:37.633
I really hate it.

137
00:11:37.634 --> 00:11:41.637
Well, you know, despite all that kind of bullshit...

138
00:11:41.638 --> 00:11:43.873
...that comes along with it...

139
00:11:43.874 --> 00:11:46.614
...I remember childhood as...

140
00:11:47.544 --> 00:11:49.779
...this magical time.

141
00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:54.260
I do. I remember when my mother first told me about death.

142
00:11:54.985 --> 00:11:59.889
My great-grandmother had died, and my family had visited them in Florida.

143
00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:02.725
I was about 3, 3 1/2 years old.

144
00:12:02.726 --> 00:12:05.795
Anyway, I was in the back yard playing...

145
00:12:05.796 --> 00:12:09.599
...and my sister had just taught me how to take the garden hose...

146
00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.602
...and do it in such a way that...

147
00:12:12.603 --> 00:12:16.723
...it sprayed into the sun and would make a rainbow.

148
00:12:17.241 --> 00:12:19.342
And so I was doing that...

149
00:12:19.343 --> 00:12:22.678
...and through the mist, I could see my grandmother.

150
00:12:22.679 --> 00:12:26.182
And she was just standing there, smiling at me.

151
00:12:26.183 --> 00:12:29.463
And I held it there for a long time...

152
00:12:29.553 --> 00:12:31.554
...and I looked at her.

153
00:12:31.555 --> 00:12:35.024
And then finally, I let go of the nozzle, you know?

154
00:12:35.025 --> 00:12:37.293
And then I dropped the hose...

155
00:12:37.294 --> 00:12:39.674
...and she disappeared.

156
00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:42.832
And so I run back inside and tell my parents.

157
00:12:42.833 --> 00:12:47.133
And they sit me down and give me this big rap on how...

158
00:12:48.038 --> 00:12:52.708
...when people die, you never see them again, and how I'd imagined it.

159
00:12:52.709 --> 00:12:55.445
But I knew what I'd seen. I was glad I saw that.

160
00:12:55.446 --> 00:12:59.615
I've never seen anything like that since. But I don't know.

161
00:12:59.616 --> 00:13:03.886
It just kind of let me know how ambiguous everything was.

162
00:13:03.887 --> 00:13:05.547
Even death.

163
00:13:06.757 --> 00:13:10.937
You're lucky you can have this attitude toward death.

164
00:13:12.062 --> 00:13:15.064
I think I'm afraid of death 24 hours a day.

165
00:13:15.065 --> 00:13:18.701
I swear. I mean, that's why I'm in a train right now.

166
00:13:18.702 --> 00:13:21.571
I could've flown to Paris, but I'm scared.

167
00:13:21.572 --> 00:13:24.073
-Oh, come on. -I can't help it.

168
00:13:24.074 --> 00:13:27.677
I know the statistics say, Na, na, na, it's safer. Whatever.

169
00:13:27.678 --> 00:13:31.013
When I'm in a plane, I can see the explosion.

170
00:13:31.014 --> 00:13:33.516
(IMITATES EXPLOSION) I can see me falling through the clouds.

171
00:13:33.517 --> 00:13:37.987
And I'm so scared of those few seconds of consciousness...

172
00:13:37.988 --> 00:13:41.988
...before you die. When you know you're gonna die.

173
00:13:44.261 --> 00:13:46.796
I can't stop thinking that way.

174
00:13:46.797 --> 00:13:48.431
It's exhausting.

175

-Come on. -What would we do?

I don't know. All I know is I catch a flight tomorrow morning at 9:30...

00:15:18.822 --> 00:15:22.391
...and I can't afford a hotel, so I was going to walk around...

Only your marriage doesn't have that same energy it used to have.

00:15:41.578 --> 00:15:43.546
You start to blame your husband.

203
00:15:43.547 --> 00:15:46.682
You think about all those guys you've met in your life...

00:15:46.683 --> 00:15:50.553
...and what might've happened if you'd picked up with one of them.

I'm one of those guys. That's me.

We were at this summer camp together, and he was a swimmer.

293
00:20:39.709 --> 00:20:42.878
He had bleached-out chlorine hair and green eyes...

294
00:20:42.879 --> 00:20:46.348
...and to improve his times, he'd shave his legs and arms.

295
00:20:46.349 --> 00:20:49.985
-That's disgusting. -He was like this gorgeous dolphin.

296
00:20:49.986 --> 00:20:52.421
My friend Emma had a big crush on him.

297
00:20:52.422 --> 00:20:56.058
So one day, I was cutting across the field back to my room...

298
00:20:56.059 --> 00:20:58.994
...and he came walking up beside me. I told him...

299
00:20:58.995 --> 00:21:02.598
...You should date Emma. She has a big crush on you.

300
00:21:02.599 --> 00:21:04.366
And he turned to me and said...

301
00:21:04.367 --> 00:21:08.437
...Well, that's too bad, because I have a big crush on you.

302
00:21:08.438 --> 00:21:11.807
So, yeah, it really scared the hell out of me...

303
00:21:11.808 --> 00:21:14.243
...because I thought he was so fine.

304
00:21:14.244 --> 00:21:19.384
Then he officially asked me on a date. I pretended I didn't like him.

305
00:21:20.317 --> 00:21:24.617
You know, I was so afraid of what I might do, you know.

306
00:21:26.389 --> 00:21:30.025
So I went to see him swim a few times at the competition.

307
00:21:30.026 --> 00:21:33.262
And he was so sexy. Really. I mean, really sexy.

308
00:21:33.263 --> 00:21:37.967
We wrote these little declarations of love at the end of the summer...

309
00:21:37.968 --> 00:21:41.570
...and, you know, promised we would keep writing forever...

310
00:21:41.571 --> 00:21:44.039
...and meet again very soon and--

311
00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.474
Did you?

312
00:21:45.475 --> 00:21:47.242
Of course not.

313
00:21:47.243 --> 00:21:52.323
Then this is the opportune time to tell you I'm a fantastic swimmer.

314
00:21:52.382 --> 00:21:54.282
-Really? -Yeah.

315
00:21:54.551 --> 00:21:57.119
-I make note of that. -Okay.

316
00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.788
-So it's my turn. No? -Yes, your turn.

317
00:21:59.789 --> 00:22:01.209
Hit me.

318
00:22:02.926 --> 00:22:05.546

319
00:22:06.596 --> 00:22:07.696
Yes.

320
00:22:07.697 --> 00:22:09.531
Next question.

321
00:22:09.532 --> 00:22:11.300
-What was the-- -Wait a minute.

322
00:22:11.301 --> 00:22:13.869
-So I can give one-word answers? -Why not?

323
00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:16.939
After I went into detail about my sexual feelings?

324
00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:21.610
They're different questions. I could answer the sexual-feelings thing.

325
00:22:21.611 --> 00:22:25.514
(GIGGLES) But, you know, love-- I mean, what if I asked you about love?

326
00:22:25.515 --> 00:22:29.485
I would have lied, but at least I would have made up a great story.

327
00:22:29.486 --> 00:22:32.287
Love is a complex issue, you know?

328
00:22:32.288 --> 00:22:37.226
I mean, yes, I've told somebody that I love them, and I've meant it.

329
00:22:37.227 --> 00:22:40.662
But was it totally unselfish, giving love?

330
00:22:40.663 --> 00:22:42.765
Was it a beautiful thing?

331
00:22:42.766 --> 00:22:46.226
Not really. You know, it's like, love....

332
00:22:46.436 --> 00:22:48.696
I mean, I don't know.

333
00:22:48.872 --> 00:22:50.412
You know?

334
00:22:50.974 --> 00:22:54.777
-Yeah. I know what you mean. -But as far as sexual feelings go...

335
00:22:54.778 --> 00:22:57.846
...it started with an obsessive relationship...

336
00:22:57.847 --> 00:23:01.083
...with Miss July, 1978. Do you know Playboy magazine?

337
00:23:01.084 --> 00:23:03.819
-I've heard of it. -You know Crystal?

338
00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:07.520
You don't know Crystal? Well, I knew Crystal.

339
00:23:08.558 --> 00:23:10.559
Is it my turn now?

340

341

-God, everything pisses me off. -List a couple.

343
00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:23.605
Oh, I know. I hate being told by strange men...

344
00:23:23.606 --> 00:23:25.674
...strange men in the street...

345
00:23:25.675 --> 00:23:30.935
...you know, to smile to make them feel better about their boring life.

Are modern souls only a fraction of the original souls?

392
00:25:18.755 --> 00:25:22.958
If they are, that represents a 5000 to 1 split of each soul...

A little old man talked to us. He was the groundskeeper.

428
00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:30.205
He explained that most of the people buried here...

429
00:29:30.206 --> 00:29:33.786
...had washed up on the bank of the Danube.

430
00:29:34.243 --> 00:29:36.211
How old are these?

00:29:36.212 --> 00:29:40.182
Around the beginning of the century. It's called No Name Cemetery...

432
00:29:40.183 --> 00:29:42.984
...because they often didn't know who those people were.

433
00:29:42.985 --> 00:29:45.420
Maybe a first name, that's all.

434
00:29:45.421 --> 00:29:47.522
Why were all the bodies washing up?

435
00:29:47.523 --> 00:29:51.660
I think some were from accidents on boats and things like that.

436
00:29:51.661 --> 00:29:56.021
But most of them were suicides that jumped in the river.

437

I always liked the idea of all those unknown people lost in the world.

439
00:30:03.172 --> 00:30:05.907
...if none of your family or friends knew you were dead...

440
00:30:05.908 --> 00:30:08.076
...then it's like not really being dead.

...and I thought she had an uncomplicated love life.

513
00:35:30.866 --> 00:35:35.103
But she just confessed to me that she spent her whole life...

514

...dreaming about another man she was in love with.

515

She just accepted her fate. It's so sad.

In the same time, I love that she had these emotions...

00:35:59.128 --> 00:36:02.030
It's not based in any kind of reality.

Romantic projections? Oh, Mr. Romantic up in the Ferris wheel?

Oh, kiss me. The sunset. Oh, it's so beautiful.

...they formed everything that is this world.

I mean, she wasn't even doing me.

589
00:40:03.338 --> 00:40:07.842
I mean, if opportunists like that ever had to tell the real truth...

590
00:40:07.843 --> 00:40:10.111
...it would put them out of business.

591
00:40:10.112 --> 00:40:14.916
Just once, I'd love to see some little old lady save up all her money...

592
00:40:14.917 --> 00:40:20.297
...to go to the fortuneteller. She'd get there and the woman would say...

...Tomorrow and all your remaining days...

594
00:40:24.927 --> 00:40:27.161
...will be exactly like today...

...a tedious collection of hours.

...she almost didn't notice you. It's weird. I wonder why.

She was really wise and intense. I really loved what she said.

00:42:54.376 --> 00:42:56.410
I was in an old church like this...

628
00:42:56.411 --> 00:43:00.411
...with my grandmother a few days ago in Budapest.

629
00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:04.819
Even though I reject most of the religious thing...

630
00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:08.990
...I can't help but feeling for those people that come here...

631

...Iost or in pain, guilt...

...Iooking for some kind of answers.

...of so many generations.

00:43:23.639 --> 00:43:26.739
You're close with your grandmother?

Yeah.

637
00:43:30.979 --> 00:43:34.882
I think it's because I always have this strange feeling...

638
00:43:34.883 --> 00:43:39.363
...that I'm this very old woman laying down, about to die.

639

That's so wild.

...Iive my life, taking notes for when I'll really have to do it.

No, not much.

...and it was fantastic.

653
00:44:34.643 --> 00:44:36.010
What they do is...

654

...the couple comes in and they kneel in front of the whole congregation...

655

...or say something.

And then, after an hour or so of just...

659

...staring at each other...

...they're married.

...and he says, Do you believe in God?

672

He says...

673
00:45:48.049 --> 00:45:49.829
...Yes, I do.

674

675
00:45:52.053 --> 00:45:53.893
We drove away.

No, not yet.

What would you be doing?

681
00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:18.579
I'd probably be hanging around the airport...

682
00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:22.880
...crying in my coffee because you didn't come with me.

683
00:46:26.054 --> 00:46:30.024
I'd probably gotten off the train in Salzburg with someone else.

Oh, yeah? Oh, I see.

685
00:46:32.194 --> 00:46:34.295
So I'm just a dumb American...

00:47:15.704 --> 00:47:20.241
...what would be the first thing about me that would drive you mad?

700
00:47:20.242 --> 00:47:23.410
No. I'm not going to answer this question.

701
00:47:23.411 --> 00:47:26.714
I dated this girl once who used to always ask me that.

702
00:47:26.715 --> 00:47:28.516
What about me bugs you?

703
00:47:28.517 --> 00:47:32.419
Finally I said, l don't think you handle criticism too well.

704
00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:35.723
She flew into a rage and broke up with me. That's true.

705
00:47:35.724 --> 00:47:38.058
All she wanted was to have an excuse...

706
00:47:38.059 --> 00:47:40.961
...to tell me what she thought was wrong with me.

707
00:47:40.962 --> 00:47:42.396
Is that what you want?

708
00:47:42.397 --> 00:47:44.632
Something about me bugs you?

709
00:47:44.633 --> 00:47:47.735
-What is it about me bugs you? -Nothing at all.

710
00:47:47.736 --> 00:47:50.571
If it had to be something, what would it be?

711
00:47:50.572 --> 00:47:54.275
If it had to be something, if I had to think about it...

712
00:47:54.276 --> 00:47:58.078
...I kind of didn't really like this reaction at the palm reader.

713
00:47:58.079 --> 00:48:00.648
You were like this rooster prick.

714
00:48:00.649 --> 00:48:02.716
What the hell is a rooster prick?

715
00:48:02.717 --> 00:48:04.418
You were like a boy whining...

716
00:48:04.419 --> 00:48:08.479
...because all the attention wasn't focused on him.

717
00:48:10.592 --> 00:48:13.127
You were like a boy walking by an ice-cream store...

718
00:48:13.128 --> 00:48:16.096
...crying because his mom won't buy him a milk shake.

719
00:48:16.097 --> 00:48:20.157
(MAN SPEAKING GERMAN) I don't care what this charlatan has to say about--

(SPEAKING GERMAN)

721
00:48:21.369 --> 00:48:22.669
(GERMAN) What?

722
00:48:25.407 --> 00:48:29.107
I understand a little, but he doesn't at all.

723
00:48:31.846 --> 00:48:34.346
May I ask you a question?

724
00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:39.150
So I would like to make a deal with you.

725
00:48:40.555 --> 00:48:45.259
I mean, instead of just asking you for money, I will ask you for a word.

726
00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:49.797
You give me a word, I take the word, and then I will write a poem...

727
00:48:49.798 --> 00:48:52.238
...with the word inside.

728
00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:55.369
And if you like it, if you like my poem...

729
00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:58.138
...if it adds something to your life in any way...

730
00:48:58.139 --> 00:49:01.442
...then you can pay me whatever you feel like.

731
00:49:01.443 --> 00:49:04.423
I'll write in English, of course.

732
00:49:04.679 --> 00:49:07.179
-Okay. -All right. Great.

733
00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:10.130
So?

734
00:49:12.187 --> 00:49:13.907
Pick a word.

735
00:49:15.323 --> 00:49:16.743
A word.

736
00:49:17.959 --> 00:49:20.427
-Milk shake. -Milk shake? Oh, good.

737
00:49:20.428 --> 00:49:23.530
I was gonna say rooster prick. But great. Milk shake.

738
00:49:23.531 --> 00:49:25.191
Milk shake?

739
00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:27.520
Okay, milk shake.

740
00:49:27.969 --> 00:49:30.469
-All right, so.... -Good.

741
00:49:41.016 --> 00:49:45.076
I gotta say, I like this Viennese variation of bum.

742
00:49:45.453 --> 00:49:48.756
I like what he said about adding something to your life.

743
00:49:48.757 --> 00:49:52.517
So, were we having our first fight back there?

744
00:49:53.995 --> 00:49:56.330
I think so. I think we were.

745
00:49:56.331 --> 00:50:00.100
Even if we were, why does everyone think conflict is so bad?

746
00:50:00.101 --> 00:50:03.137
There's a lot of good things coming out of conflict.

747
00:50:03.138 --> 00:50:05.158
Yeah, I guess so.

748
00:50:05.273 --> 00:50:08.709
I always think if I could just accept the fact...

749
00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:12.846
...that my life was supposed to be difficult, that's what's expected...

750
00:50:12.847 --> 00:50:14.882
...then I might not get so pissed off.

751
00:50:14.883 --> 00:50:17.918
And I'd just be glad when something nice happens.

752
00:50:17.919 --> 00:50:19.586
That's why I'm still in school.

753
00:50:19.587 --> 00:50:22.289
It's easier to have something to fight against.

754
00:50:22.290 --> 00:50:26.460
Well, we've all had such competitiveness ingrained in us.

755
00:50:26.461 --> 00:50:29.797
You know, I can be doing the most nothing thing.

756
00:50:29.798 --> 00:50:32.332
Throwing some darts or shooting some pool.

757
00:50:32.333 --> 00:50:35.369
Then all of a sudden, I feel it come over me.

758
00:50:35.370 --> 00:50:37.450
I have got to win.

759
00:50:37.806 --> 00:50:41.475
Is that why you tried to get me off the train? Competitiveness?

760
00:50:41.476 --> 00:50:43.496
What do you mean?

761
00:50:44.713 --> 00:50:46.280
I got a poem.

762
00:50:46.281 --> 00:50:48.121
Oh, all right.

763
00:50:49.551 --> 00:50:51.931
Will you read it to us?

764
00:50:54.856 --> 00:50:56.516
Sure. Okay.

00:51:35.530 --> 00:51:37.297

-Here. Thank you. -Thank you.

Good luck.

790
00:52:25.346 --> 00:52:27.606
It was wonderful, no?

791
00:52:31.719 --> 00:52:34.588
-What? -He probably didn't just write that.

792
00:52:34.589 --> 00:52:37.457
He wrote it, but he probably plugs that word in.

793

794
00:52:39.928 --> 00:52:41.728

But what good is saved time if nobody uses it?

00:53:03.051 --> 00:53:07.688
I never hear anybody say, With the time I've saved using my word processor...

800
00:53:07.689 --> 00:53:10.958

We haven't talked about this yet, but are you dating anyone?

818
00:55:07.041 --> 00:55:11.611
You got a boyfriend waiting on you back in Paris or anything like that?

819
00:55:11.612 --> 00:55:14.592
-No, not right now. -But you did.

820
00:55:15.817 --> 00:55:17.718
We broke up six months ago.

821
00:55:17.719 --> 00:55:20.420
Six months ago? Oh, I'm sorry.

822
00:55:20.421 --> 00:55:23.357
I mean, I'm not that sorry. Tell me about it.

823
00:55:23.358 --> 00:55:26.998
No way. I can't. It's really, really boring.

824
00:55:27.328 --> 00:55:29.888
Come on. Tell me about it.

825
00:55:31.566 --> 00:55:33.533
I was really disappointed.

826
00:55:33.534 --> 00:55:37.004
I thought this one would last for a while. He was...

827
00:55:37.005 --> 00:55:40.825
...very stupid, ugly, bad in bed, alcoholic....

828
00:55:41.743 --> 00:55:44.663
(LAUGHING) -You know. -A real prize winner.

829
00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:47.581
I was kind of giving him a favor.

830
00:55:47.582 --> 00:55:50.550
But he left me, saying I loved him too much.

831
00:55:50.551 --> 00:55:55.271
I was blocking his artistic expression or some shit like that.

832
00:55:56.024 --> 00:55:59.226
But anyway, I was traumatized and became--

(SIGHS)

834
00:55:59.227 --> 00:56:01.962
And became totally obsessed with him.

835
00:56:01.963 --> 00:56:05.298
So I went to a shrink, and it came up that I had written...

836
00:56:05.299 --> 00:56:10.439
...this stupid story about this woman trying to kill her boyfriend...

837
00:56:10.805 --> 00:56:12.305
...and how she'd do it.

838
00:56:12.306 --> 00:56:15.842
It's all the details of how to do it and not get caught--

839
00:56:15.843 --> 00:56:18.823
(LAUGHING) She was gonna kill her boyfriend?

840
00:56:19.847 --> 00:56:24.284
Yeah, she was. It's nothing I would do, but it was just some writing.

841
00:56:24.285 --> 00:56:25.752
No, I understand.

842
00:56:25.753 --> 00:56:28.789
This stupid shrink believed everything I told her.

843
00:56:28.790 --> 00:56:32.692
It was my first time seeing her. She said she had to call the police.

844
00:56:32.693 --> 00:56:35.313
She had to call the police?

845
00:56:36.297 --> 00:56:39.299
She was totally convinced I was really gonna do it.

846
00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:42.436
Even though I had explained it was just some writing.

847
00:56:42.437 --> 00:56:45.572
She said, looking into my eyes, The way you said it...

848
00:56:45.573 --> 00:56:47.641
...I know you are going to do it.

849
00:56:47.642 --> 00:56:50.562
She was totally out of her mind.

850
00:56:51.012 --> 00:56:53.780
It was my first and last session.

851
00:56:53.781 --> 00:56:56.101
So what happened then?

852
00:56:57.452 --> 00:56:59.832
I totally got over him.

853
00:56:59.954 --> 00:57:01.488
But now, I'm obsessed...

854
00:57:01.489 --> 00:57:06.329
...that he's gonna die from an accident or 1000 kilometers away.

855
00:57:10.998 --> 00:57:13.967
Why is it you become obsessed with people you don't...

856
00:57:13.968 --> 00:57:15.902
...really like that much?

857
00:57:15.903 --> 00:57:17.683
I don't know.

858
00:57:19.707 --> 00:57:21.727
So how about you?

859
00:57:22.643 --> 00:57:25.323
-What? -Are you with anyone?

860
00:57:26.781 --> 00:57:30.750
It's funny how we managed to avoid this subject for so long.

861
00:57:30.751 --> 00:57:32.719
But now you have to tell me.

862
00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:35.122
Well, I kind of see love...

863
00:57:35.123 --> 00:57:39.963
...as this escape for two people who don't know how to be alone.

864
00:57:41.162 --> 00:57:43.830
It's funny. People always talk about how...

865
00:57:43.831 --> 00:57:46.833
...Iove is this totally unselfish, giving thing.

866
00:57:46.834 --> 00:57:50.937
But if you think about it, there's nothing more selfish.

867
00:57:50.938 --> 00:57:52.358
I know.

868
00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:55.840
So who just broke up with you?

869
00:57:56.911 --> 00:57:58.211
What?

870
00:58:00.381 --> 00:58:02.883
You sound like you just were hurt.

871
00:58:02.884 --> 00:58:04.184
Do l?

872
00:58:04.452 --> 00:58:06.052
All right.

873
00:58:06.888 --> 00:58:08.788
Big confession.

874
00:58:09.056 --> 00:58:12.659
I should've told you this earlier or something.

875
00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:15.328
I didn't come to Europe just to...

876
00:58:15.329 --> 00:58:19.266
...hang out and read Hemingway in Paris and shit like that.

877
00:58:19.267 --> 00:58:22.769
I saved up my money all spring to fly to Madrid...

878
00:58:22.770 --> 00:58:25.539
...and spend the summer with my girlfriend--

879
00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:27.474
-Your girlfriend? -My ex-girlfriend...

880
00:58:27.475 --> 00:58:31.011
...who has been on this art history program for the last year.

881
00:58:31.012 --> 00:58:34.614
Anyway, I got here. We were reunited at long last...

882
00:58:34.615 --> 00:58:38.952
...and we went out to dinner our first night with six of her friends.

883
00:58:38.953 --> 00:58:41.513
Pedro, Antonio, Gonzalo...

884
00:58:41.789 --> 00:58:44.157
...Maria, Suzy from home.

885
00:58:44.158 --> 00:58:47.727
She managed to avoid being alone with me for the first few days...

886
00:58:47.728 --> 00:58:53.228
...and I stuck around just to let it sink in that she wished I hadn't come.

887
00:58:54.135 --> 00:58:58.104
So I bought the cheapest flight out, this one leaving out of Vienna.

888
00:58:58.105 --> 00:59:02.275
It didn't leave for a couple weeks, so I bought this Eurail pass.

889
00:59:02.276 --> 00:59:07.356
You know what's the worst thing about somebody breaking up with you?

890
00:59:08.316 --> 00:59:11.318
It's when you remember how little you thought about...

891
00:59:11.319 --> 00:59:15.379
...the people you broke up with, and you realize...

892
00:59:16.953 --> 00:59:18.493
(CHUCKLING)

893
00:59:18.092 --> 00:59:20.594
You'd like to think you're both in pain...

894
00:59:20.595 --> 00:59:23.797
(LAUGHING) ...but really, they're just, Hey, I'm glad you're gone.

895
00:59:23.798 --> 00:59:25.938
Believe me, I know.

896
00:59:26.467 --> 00:59:29.447
You should look at bright colors.

897
00:59:30.171 --> 00:59:32.239
That's what the shrink told me.

898
00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:35.041
I was paying her 900 francs an hour...

899
00:59:35.042 --> 00:59:37.544
...to hear that l was a homicidal maniac...

900
00:59:37.545 --> 00:59:41.815
...but I could shift my obsession if l would concentrate on bright colors.

901
00:59:41.816 --> 00:59:43.536
Did it work?

902
00:59:46.621 --> 00:59:49.289
(LAUGHING) -Didn't help your pinball. -Well, no.

903
00:59:49.290 --> 00:59:53.293
Yeah, well, you know, I haven't killed anyone lately.

904
00:59:53.294 --> 00:59:54.928
Not lately?

905
00:59:54.929 --> 00:59:57.789
That's good. You're cured then.

906
01:00:03.271 --> 01:00:06.840
There's breeds of monkeys, and all they do is have sex...

907
01:00:06.841 --> 01:00:08.475
...all the time.

908
01:00:08.476 --> 01:00:10.910
And they turn out to be the least violent...

909
01:00:10.911 --> 01:00:14.080
...the most peaceful, the most happy.

910
01:00:14.081 --> 01:00:16.783
So maybe fooling around's not so bad.

911
01:00:16.784 --> 01:00:20.120
-Are you talking about monkeys? -Yes, I am.

912
01:00:20.121 --> 01:00:22.321
-I thought so. -Why?

913
01:00:25.593 --> 01:00:28.228
...male argument to justify them fooling around.

914
01:00:28.229 --> 01:00:33.129
(GROANS) Women monkeys are fooling around too. Everybody's fooling around.

915
01:00:33.501 --> 01:00:37.270
That's cute. I have this awful, paranoid thought...

916
01:00:37.271 --> 01:00:40.674
...that feminism was mostly invented by men so they could...

917
01:00:40.675 --> 01:00:42.175
...fool around more.

918
01:00:42.176 --> 01:00:45.545
Woman, free your mind, free your body. Sleep with me.

919
01:00:45.546 --> 01:00:50.446
We're all happy and free, as long as I can fuck as much as I can.

920
01:00:50.885 --> 01:00:52.018
All right.

921
01:00:52.019 --> 01:00:55.522
But maybe there's some biological things at work here.

922
01:00:55.523 --> 01:00:57.257
If you had an island...

923
01:00:57.258 --> 01:01:01.858
...and there were 99 women on the island and only one man...

924
01:01:02.096 --> 01:01:05.098
...in a year, you'd have the possibility of 99 babies.

925
01:01:05.099 --> 01:01:08.601
But if you have an island with 99 men and only one woman...

926
01:01:08.602 --> 01:01:13.382
...in a year, you have the possibility of only one baby. So....

927
01:01:13.574 --> 01:01:14.741
You know what?

928
01:01:14.742 --> 01:01:19.112
On this island, I think there will be only, like, maybe 43 men left.

929
01:01:19.113 --> 01:01:23.216
They would've killed each other trying to fuck this poor woman.

930
01:01:23.217 --> 01:01:27.654
And on the other island, there would be 99 women, 99 babies...

931
01:01:27.655 --> 01:01:29.522
...and no more man.

932
01:01:29.523 --> 01:01:32.292
Because they would've all eaten him alive.

933
01:01:32.293 --> 01:01:33.833
Oh, yeah?

934
01:01:33.894 --> 01:01:35.829
There's something to that.

935
01:01:35.830 --> 01:01:40.490
On some level, women don't mind the idea of destroying a man.

936
01:01:41.202 --> 01:01:44.270
I was walking down the street with my ex-girlfriend...

937
01:01:44.271 --> 01:01:48.975
...and we'd just walked by these four thuggy-looking guys next to a Camaro.

938
01:01:48.976 --> 01:01:52.345
And one of them says, Hey, baby. Nice ass!

939
01:01:52.346 --> 01:01:56.216
So I'm like, No big deal. I won't get uptight about this.

940
01:01:56.217 --> 01:01:57.984
Plus, there were four of them.

941
01:01:57.985 --> 01:02:01.154
Exactly. But she says, Fuck you, dickheads!

942
01:02:01.155 --> 01:02:04.555
And I'm like, Okay. Wait a minute, here.

943
01:02:04.558 --> 01:02:07.327
They're not gonna come over and kick her ass.

944
01:02:07.328 --> 01:02:10.463
So who just got pushed to the frontline on that one?

945
01:02:10.464 --> 01:02:13.633
Women say they hate it if you're all protective.

946
01:02:13.634 --> 01:02:18.204
But if it suits them, then they'll tell you you're being unmanly.

947
01:02:18.205 --> 01:02:22.985
You know what? I don't think woman really wants to destroy man.

948
01:02:23.244 --> 01:02:25.812
Even if they want to, they don't succeed.

949
01:02:25.813 --> 01:02:28.214
I'm sure even men are destroying women...

950
01:02:28.215 --> 01:02:31.484
...or are capable of destroying women much more than women--

951
01:02:31.485 --> 01:02:33.987
Anyway, it's depressing. You know what?

952
01:02:33.988 --> 01:02:36.790
-You wanna stop talking about this? -I hate it.

953
01:02:36.791 --> 01:02:38.558
Men, women, it's....

954
01:02:38.559 --> 01:02:40.819
There's no end to it.

955
01:02:41.595 --> 01:02:43.296
(LAUGHS) It's like a skipping record.

956
01:02:43.297 --> 01:02:46.699
Every couple's been having this conversation forever.

957
01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:49.680
And nobody came up with anything.

958
01:03:05.453 --> 01:03:08.087
I saw a documentary on that. It's a birth dance.

959
01:03:08.088 --> 01:03:09.928
A birth dance?

960
01:03:38.018 --> 01:03:40.286
Should I give her some money?

961
01:03:40.287 --> 01:03:44.347
Everything that's interesting costs a little money.

962
01:03:45.125 --> 01:03:46.926
So a birth dance, huh?

963
01:03:46.927 --> 01:03:49.863
Looked a little bit like a mating dance to me.

964
01:03:49.864 --> 01:03:52.866
No, but really. Women used it when giving birth.

965
01:03:52.867 --> 01:03:56.207
In part of the world, they still do it.

966
01:03:56.504 --> 01:03:59.172
The woman in labor enters a tent...

967
01:03:59.173 --> 01:04:01.975
...and the women of her tribe surround her and dance.

968
01:04:01.976 --> 01:04:04.477
They encourage her to dance with them...

969
01:04:04.478 --> 01:04:06.980
...so as to make the birth less painful.

970
01:04:06.981 --> 01:04:11.401
And when the baby is born, they all dance in celebration.

971
01:04:11.552 --> 01:04:14.354
I don't think my mom would've gone for that.

972
01:04:14.355 --> 01:04:18.758
I like the idea of dancing as something everybody participates in.

973
01:04:18.759 --> 01:04:21.979
I know. I heard about this old guy...

974
01:04:22.096 --> 01:04:24.430
...who was watching some young people dance.

975
01:04:24.431 --> 01:04:26.032
He said, How beautiful.

976
01:04:26.033 --> 01:04:29.168
They're shaking off their genitals to become angels.

977
01:04:29.169 --> 01:04:30.270
I like that.

978
01:04:30.271 --> 01:04:31.671
One question, though.

979
01:04:31.672 --> 01:04:35.542
When the women are dancing and being all spiritual and stuff...

980
01:04:35.543 --> 01:04:36.843
...where are the men?

981
01:04:36.844 --> 01:04:41.347
Are we out food gathering? Are we not invited? You all don't need us?

982
01:04:41.348 --> 01:04:43.850
Men are lucky we don't bite off their heads after mating.

983
01:04:43.851 --> 01:04:47.020
Certain insects do that, like spiders and stuff?

984
01:04:47.021 --> 01:04:49.622
We let you live. What are you complaining about?

985
01:04:49.623 --> 01:04:53.459
See, you're officially kidding. But there's something to that.

986
01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:56.229
You keep bringing stuff like that up.

987
01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:59.832
No, no. Wait a minute. Talking seriously here.

988
01:04:59.833 --> 01:05:02.936
I mean, I always feel this pressure of being...

989
01:05:02.937 --> 01:05:05.772
...a strong and independent icon of womanhood...

990
01:05:05.773 --> 01:05:08.007
...and not making it look like...

991
01:05:08.008 --> 01:05:11.768
...my whole life is revolving around some guy.

992
01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:14.213
But loving someone...

993
01:05:14.214 --> 01:05:17.554
...and being loved means so much to me.

994
01:05:18.319 --> 01:05:21.479
I always make fun of it and stuff...

995
01:05:21.655 --> 01:05:23.890
...but isn't everything we do in life...

996
01:05:23.891 --> 01:05:26.991
...a way to be loved a little more?

997
01:05:31.131 --> 01:05:32.865
I don't know.

998
01:05:32.866 --> 01:05:35.001
Sometimes I dream...

999
01:05:35.002 --> 01:05:38.237
...about being a good father and a good husband.

1000
01:05:38.238 --> 01:05:41.374
And sometimes it feels really close.

1001
01:05:41.375 --> 01:05:43.755
But then other times...

1002
01:05:44.345 --> 01:05:46.545
...it seems silly...

1003
01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:48.414
...Iike it would...

1004
01:05:48.415 --> 01:05:50.735
...ruin my whole life.

1005
01:05:50.884 --> 01:05:54.253
And it's not just a fear of commitment...

1006
01:05:54.254 --> 01:05:57.590
...or that I'm incapable of caring or loving because...

1007
01:05:57.591 --> 01:05:59.131
...I can.

1008
01:05:59.727 --> 01:06:03.847
It's just that, if I'm totally honest with myself...

1009
01:06:04.131 --> 01:06:05.999
...I think I'd rather die knowing...

1010
01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.735
...that I was really good at something.

1011
01:06:08.736 --> 01:06:11.776
That I had excelled in some way...

1012
01:06:11.805 --> 01:06:13.906
...than that I'd just been in...

1013
01:06:13.907 --> 01:06:16.767
...a nice, caring relationship.

1014
01:06:23.417 --> 01:06:27.020
I had worked for this older man, and once he told me...

1015
01:06:27.021 --> 01:06:30.890
...that he had spent all of his life thinking about his career.

1016
01:06:30.891 --> 01:06:33.826
He was 52, and it suddenly struck him...

1017
01:06:33.827 --> 01:06:37.397
...that he had never really given anything of himself.

1018
01:06:37.398 --> 01:06:40.558
His life was for no one and nothing.

1019
01:06:41.135 --> 01:06:44.115
He was almost crying saying that.

1020
01:06:46.473 --> 01:06:49.142
I believe if there's any kind of God...

1021
01:06:49.143 --> 01:06:51.444
...it wouldn't be in any of us...

1022
01:06:51.445 --> 01:06:53.585
...not you or me...

1023
01:06:54.114 --> 01:06:57.574
...but just this little space in between.

1024
01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:02.488
If there's any kind of magic in this world...

1025
01:07:02.489 --> 01:07:07.809
...it must be in the attempt of understanding someone sharing something.

1026
01:07:09.163 --> 01:07:12.803
I know, it's almost impossible to succeed...

1027
01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:15.740
...but who cares really?

1028
01:07:37.236 --> 01:07:38.836

I think this is a civilization in decline. Look at the service.

01:08:31.011 --> 01:08:35.491
Where is the waitress? In New York, she'd be out of a job.

1034
01:08:43.557 --> 01:08:45.892
I'm gonna call my friend in Paris...

...who I'm supposed to have lunch with in eight hours.

1036
01:08:57.237 --> 01:08:58.671
Pick up.

1037
01:08:58.672 --> 01:09:01.532

1040
01:09:17.991 --> 01:09:20.851
(LAUGHS) Yeah, okay. That's a good idea.

1041
01:09:22.129 --> 01:09:26.369
I don't think I'll be able to make it for lunch today.

01:09:36.176 --> 01:09:39.412
-He's Austrian? He's from there? -No, No.

1045
01:09:39.413 --> 01:09:43.316
He's passing through. He's American. He's going back home tomorrow.

1046
01:09:43.317 --> 01:09:45.397
Why'd you get off?

1047
01:09:45.886 --> 01:09:48.206
Well, he convinced me.

1048
01:09:49.256 --> 01:09:53.226
I mean, actually, I was ready to get off the train with him...

1049
01:09:53.227 --> 01:09:55.394
...after talking to him a short while.

1050
01:09:55.395 --> 01:09:58.555
He was so sweet, I couldn't help it.

1051
01:09:58.832 --> 01:10:01.467
In the lounge car, he began to talk about...

1052
01:10:01.468 --> 01:10:05.648
...him as a boy seeing his great-grandmother's ghost.

1053
01:10:05.939 --> 01:10:09.039
I think that's when I fell for him.

1054
01:10:09.276 --> 01:10:14.176
Just the idea of this little boy with all those beautiful dreams.

1055
01:10:14.581 --> 01:10:16.421
He trapped me.

1056
01:10:19.419 --> 01:10:21.320
And he's so cute.

1057
01:10:21.321 --> 01:10:23.689
He has beautiful blue eyes...

1058
01:10:23.690 --> 01:10:25.890
...nice pink lips...

1059
01:10:26.526 --> 01:10:28.426
(LAUGHING) ...greasy hair.

1060
01:10:28.829 --> 01:10:30.429
I love it.

1061
01:10:30.797 --> 01:10:34.437
He's kind of tall, and he's a little clumsy.

1062
01:10:35.302 --> 01:10:39.122
I like to feel his eyes on me when I look away.

1063
01:10:42.442 --> 01:10:45.745
He kind of kisses like an adolescent. It's so cute.

1064
01:10:45.746 --> 01:10:49.386
-What? -Yeah, we kissed. It was so adorable.

1065
01:10:50.250 --> 01:10:54.610
As the night went on, I began to like him more and more.

1066
01:10:55.188 --> 01:10:57.023
I'm afraid he's scared of me.

1067
01:10:57.024 --> 01:11:01.494
I told him the story about the woman that kills her ex-boyfriend.

1068
01:11:01.495 --> 01:11:03.162
He must be scared to death.

1069
01:11:03.163 --> 01:11:07.403
He must be thinking I'm this manipulative, mean woman.

1070
01:11:08.702 --> 01:11:11.404
I just hope he doesn't feel that way about me.

1071
01:11:11.405 --> 01:11:15.465
Because, you know me, I'm the most harmless person.

1072
01:11:15.876 --> 01:11:19.636
The only person I could really hurt is myself.

1073
01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:21.781
I don't think he's scared of you.

1074
01:11:21.782 --> 01:11:24.250
I think he's crazy about you.

1075
01:11:24.251 --> 01:11:26.552
-Really? -I've known you a long time.

1076
01:11:26.553 --> 01:11:30.313
I got a good feeling. You gonna see him again?

1077
01:11:31.792 --> 01:11:34.772
We haven't talked about that yet.

1078
01:11:38.899 --> 01:11:41.801
Okay, it's your turn. You call your friend.

1079
01:11:41.802 --> 01:11:44.062
All right, all right.

1080
01:11:47.107 --> 01:11:50.687
I usually get this guy's answering machine.

1081
01:11:52.346 --> 01:11:54.546
(LAUGHING) Hi, dude. What's up?

1082
01:11:55.916 --> 01:11:58.951
Hey, Frank. How you been? I'm glad you're home.

1083
01:11:58.952 --> 01:12:00.586
Cool. Yeah.

1084
01:12:00.587 --> 01:12:02.667
So how was Madrid?

1085
01:12:02.823 --> 01:12:04.663
Madrid sucked.

1086
01:12:05.592 --> 01:12:08.794
Lisa and I had our long overdue meltdown.

1087
01:12:08.795 --> 01:12:10.896
Too bad. I told you, no?

1088
01:12:10.897 --> 01:12:14.266
Yeah, yeah. The long-distance thing just never works.

1089
01:12:14.267 --> 01:12:16.502
I was only in Madrid for a couple days.

1090
01:12:16.503 --> 01:12:19.723
I got a cheaper flight out of Vienna.

1091
01:12:21.174 --> 01:12:24.610
You know, it really wasn't that much cheaper. I just....

1092
01:12:24.611 --> 01:12:29.048
I couldn't go home right away. I didn't want to see anybody I knew.

1093
01:12:29.049 --> 01:12:33.049
I just wanted to be a ghost, completely anonymous.

1094
01:12:33.487 --> 01:12:35.021
So are you okay now?

1095
01:12:35.022 --> 01:12:38.657
Yeah. I'm great. I'm great. That's the thing.

1096
01:12:38.658 --> 01:12:40.326
I'm rapturous.

1097
01:12:40.327 --> 01:12:42.028
And I'll tell you why.

1098
01:12:42.029 --> 01:12:45.131
I met somebody on my last night in Europe.

1099
01:12:45.132 --> 01:12:48.034
-That's incredible. -I know, I know.

1100
01:12:48.035 --> 01:12:52.438
You know how they say we're all each other's demons and angels?

1101
01:12:52.439 --> 01:12:56.139
Well, she was literally a Botticelli angel...

1102
01:12:56.610 --> 01:12:59.950
...telling me everything would be okay.

1103
01:13:01.648 --> 01:13:03.668
How did you meet?

1104
01:13:04.418 --> 01:13:06.198
On the train.

1105
01:13:06.353 --> 01:13:09.722
She was sitting next to a weird couple that was fighting...

1106
01:13:09.723 --> 01:13:13.092
...so she moved. She sat right across the aisle from me.

1107
01:13:13.093 --> 01:13:15.227
So we started to talk.

1108
01:13:15.228 --> 01:13:17.630
She didn't like me much at first.

1109
01:13:17.631 --> 01:13:19.465
She's super smart...

1110
01:13:19.466 --> 01:13:21.726
...very passionate...

1111
01:13:22.269 --> 01:13:24.289
...and beautiful.

1112
01:13:25.005 --> 01:13:27.805
And I was so unsure of myself.

1113
01:13:27.808 --> 01:13:31.568
I thought everything I said sounded so stupid.

1114
01:13:32.412 --> 01:13:35.632
Oh, man. I wouldn't worry about that.

1115
01:13:36.049 --> 01:13:38.818
No, I'm sure she was not judging you.

1116
01:13:38.819 --> 01:13:41.320
No, and by the way, she sat next to you.

1117
01:13:41.321 --> 01:13:43.255
I'm sure she did it on purpose.

1118
01:13:43.256 --> 01:13:44.796
(LAUGHS) Oh, yeah?

1119
01:13:48.361 --> 01:13:53.141
Us men are so stupid. We don't understand anything about women.

1120
01:13:53.433 --> 01:13:56.535
They act strange, the little I know of them.

1121
01:13:56.536 --> 01:13:58.196
Don't they?

1122
01:14:04.878 --> 01:14:08.638
I feel like this is some dream world we're in.

1123
01:14:08.982 --> 01:14:10.983
Yeah, it's so weird.

1124
01:14:10.984 --> 01:14:13.385
It's like our time together is just ours.

1125
01:14:13.386 --> 01:14:15.706
It's our own creation.

1126
01:14:15.956 --> 01:14:19.859
It must be like I'm in your dream and you're in mine.

1127
01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:23.362
And what's so cool is that this whole evening...

1128
01:14:23.363 --> 01:14:27.066
...all our time together, shouldn't officially be happening.

1129
01:14:27.067 --> 01:14:31.547
Yeah, I know. Maybe that's why this feels so otherworldly.

1130
01:14:32.639 --> 01:14:36.976
But then the morning comes and we turn into pumpkins, right?

1131
01:14:35.654 --> 01:14:37.134
(LAUGHING)

1132
01:14:36.977 --> 01:14:38.397
I know.

1133
01:14:39.546 --> 01:14:42.548
But now, you're supposed to produce the glass slipper...

1134
01:14:42.549 --> 01:14:44.869
...and see if it fits.

1135
01:14:47.287 --> 01:14:48.887
It'll fit.

1136
01:15:07.174 --> 01:15:09.074
This friend of mine had a kid...

1137
01:15:09.075 --> 01:15:12.511
...and it was a home birth, so he was there helping out.

1138
01:15:12.512 --> 01:15:16.332
But he said at that profound moment of birth...

1139
01:15:16.783 --> 01:15:20.753
...he was watching his child experiencing life for the first time...

1140
01:15:20.754 --> 01:15:22.888
...trying to take its first breath.

1141
01:15:22.889 --> 01:15:26.625
All he could think about was that he was looking at something...

1142
01:15:26.626 --> 01:15:28.994
...that was gonna die someday.

1143
01:15:28.995 --> 01:15:31.830
He couldn't get it out of his head.

1144
01:15:31.831 --> 01:15:35.701
And I think that's so true. Everything is so finite.

1145
01:15:35.702 --> 01:15:38.671
But don't you think that's what...

1146
01:15:38.672 --> 01:15:42.208
...makes our time and specific moments so important?

1147
01:15:42.209 --> 01:15:43.442
Yeah, I know.

1148
01:15:43.443 --> 01:15:46.663
It's the same for us tonight, though.

1149
01:15:48.582 --> 01:15:53.482
After tomorrow, we'll probably never see each other again, right?

1150
01:15:54.187 --> 01:15:57.707
You don't think we'll ever see each other?

1151
01:15:59.059 --> 01:16:01.139
What do you think?

1152
01:16:06.666 --> 01:16:09.046
Actually, I don't know.

1153
01:16:09.269 --> 01:16:10.703
I hadn't planned another--

1154
01:16:10.704 --> 01:16:14.473
Me too. I live in Paris, you live in the U.S. I understand.

1155
01:16:14.474 --> 01:16:17.610
I'd hate to make you fly. You'd hate to fly, right?

1156
01:16:17.611 --> 01:16:20.291
I'm not so scared of flying.

1157
01:16:20.547 --> 01:16:21.780
I mean, I could.

1158
01:16:21.781 --> 01:16:23.749
Well, if you were gonna...

1159
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:25.517
...come to the U.S...

1160
01:16:25.518 --> 01:16:27.119
...or if, you know, if l....

1161
01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:29.980
I mean, I could come back here.

1162
01:16:30.624 --> 01:16:31.924
What?

1163
01:16:32.626 --> 01:16:36.326
No, let's just be rational adults about this.

1164
01:16:38.798 --> 01:16:40.699
We should try something different.

1165
01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:44.820
It's not so bad if tonight is our only night, right?

1166
01:16:45.238 --> 01:16:47.339
People exchange numbers, addresses.

1167
01:16:47.340 --> 01:16:50.376
They end up writing once, calling each other twice.

1168
01:16:50.377 --> 01:16:52.444
Right. Fizzles out.

1169
01:16:52.445 --> 01:16:55.665
Yeah, I don't want that. I hate that.

1170
01:16:55.949 --> 01:16:57.909
I hate that too.

1171
01:16:58.151 --> 01:17:01.687
Why does everybody think relationships should last forever?

1172
01:17:01.688 --> 01:17:04.068
Yeah, why? It's stupid.

1173
01:17:05.592 --> 01:17:08.212
But you think tonight's it?

1174
01:17:08.461 --> 01:17:11.741
I mean, that tonight's our only night?

1175
01:17:13.967 --> 01:17:16.287
It's the only way, no?

1176
01:17:19.139 --> 01:17:21.099
Well, all right.

1177
01:17:22.008 --> 01:17:23.609
Let's do it.

1178
01:17:23.610 --> 01:17:26.350
No delusions, no projections.

1179
01:17:27.347 --> 01:17:30.147
(VIOLIN, ACCORDION) We'll just make tonight great.

1180
01:17:32.052 --> 01:17:33.892
Let's do that.

1181
01:17:36.608 --> 01:17:38.148
(CONTINUES)

1182
01:17:50.737 --> 01:17:53.439
We should do some kind of handshake.

1183
01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:55.520
Give me your hand.

1184
01:17:58.178 --> 01:18:00.498
To our one and only...

1185
01:18:01.948 --> 01:18:04.148
...night together...

1186
01:18:04.184 --> 01:18:06.924
...and the hours that remain.

1187
01:18:09.054 --> 01:18:10.414
(KISSES)

1188
01:18:15.362 --> 01:18:16.662
What?

1189
01:18:19.199 --> 01:18:20.866
It's just....

1190
01:18:20.867 --> 01:18:23.067
It's depressing, no?

1191
01:18:23.670 --> 01:18:26.638
Now, the only thing we're gonna think of is...

1192
01:18:26.639 --> 01:18:29.375
...when we'll have to say goodbye.

1193
01:18:29.376 --> 01:18:32.778
We could say goodbye now. Then we won't worry about it.

1194
01:18:32.779 --> 01:18:34.019
Now?

1195
01:18:34.714 --> 01:18:36.081
Say goodbye.

1196
01:18:36.082 --> 01:18:37.982
(CHUCKLES) -Bye. -Goodbye.

1197
01:18:39.152 --> 01:18:40.319
Au revoir.

1198
01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:42.580
-Later. -Later, yeah.

1199
01:18:43.501 --> 01:18:45.041
(CONTINUES)

1200
01:19:12.419 --> 01:19:14.379
Here's the plan.

1201
01:19:17.490 --> 01:19:19.391
-Red wine. -Red wine. Right.

1202
01:19:19.392 --> 01:19:22.792
-You think you can do that? -No problem.

1203
01:19:27.333 --> 01:19:29.893
-Wish me luck. -Good luck.

1204
01:19:31.538 --> 01:19:32.898
Hello.

1205
01:19:37.177 --> 01:19:38.677
Do you speak English?

1206
01:19:38.678 --> 01:19:40.938
-A bit. -Yeah? A bit?

1207
01:19:40.947 --> 01:19:43.782
I'm having kind of an odd situation...

1208
01:19:43.783 --> 01:19:45.918
...which is that....

1209
01:19:45.919 --> 01:19:48.659
You see that girl over there?

1210
01:19:52.258 --> 01:19:55.394
Well, this is our only night together...

1211
01:19:55.395 --> 01:19:57.235
...and she....

1212
01:19:58.998 --> 01:20:02.501
The problem is that she wants a bottle of red wine...

1213
01:20:02.502 --> 01:20:05.302
(LAUGHING) ...and I don't have any money.

1214
01:20:10.577 --> 01:20:14.546
...give me the address of this bar, and I would promise...

01:34:31.470 --> 01:34:35.406
Last night. Six months from last night, which was...

1390
01:34:35.407 --> 01:34:37.247
...June 1 6th.

1391
01:34:41.613 --> 01:34:43.153
December.

1392
01:34:43.315 --> 01:34:47.915
It's a train ride for you, but I gotta fly all the way here.

1393
01:34:48.554 --> 01:34:51.114
-Okay, me too. -All right.

1394
01:34:52.591 --> 01:34:54.359
We won't call, write or--

1395
01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:56.560
No, it's depressing.

1396
01:34:59.098 --> 01:35:01.065
Your train's gonna leave.

1397
01:35:01.066 --> 01:35:02.786
Say goodbye.

1398
01:35:03.402 --> 01:35:04.642
Bye.

1399
01:35:07.906 --> 01:35:09.506
Au revoir.

1400
01:35:10.576 --> 01:35:11.936
Later.
