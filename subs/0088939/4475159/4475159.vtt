00:03:04.142 --> 00:03:06.811
Girls, your mama got supper.

6
00:03:14.945 --> 00:03:19.407
Celie, you got the ugliest smile this side of Creation.

It'd kill your mama.

14
00:05:03.387 --> 00:05:07.014
Dear God, I'm 14 years old.

Let me know what's happening to me.

18
00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:24.323
One day, my daddy come and say,
"You gonna do what your mama wouldn't."

19
00:05:24.616 --> 00:05:28.536
Now, I got two children by my daddy.

25
00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:50.933
...because her heart been broke.

26

Dear God, he act like
he can't stand me no more.

27
00:06:11.538 --> 00:06:14.331
I don't think he killed my baby boy.

28
00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:20.463
I heard he sold it
to a preacher and his wife.

29
00:06:26.344 --> 00:06:29.638

Celie is ugly but she works hard,

90
00:12:29.791 --> 00:12:31.875
Not since their mammy did it.
