1
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.410
Aah!

2
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.780
- Whoo!
- Ha ha ha!

3
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.790
Aah!

4
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.350
Oh, man! Heh heh.

5
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.860
- Did you see that?
- Woo!

6
00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.800
Oh, my God. Ha ha!

7
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.860
- Yes! Yes!
- Nice, nice, nice.

8
00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.240
- Aw, sick!
- Worth the wait.

9
00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.260
Oh, babe. You missed out.

10
00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.300
Yes!

11
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.740
I want to get off.

12
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.150
Whoo! Ow!

13
00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.350
Ha ha ha!

14
00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:18.720
That was intense, man.

15
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.990
To feel how that would be
to just crash and burn like that.

16
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.830
Yeah, yeah. Maybe for you,
but our lives are actually goin' somewhere.

17
00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.990
Oh! OK, well, where we gotta go
is to the roller coaster.

18
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.830
'Cause our pass is for 9:15.

19
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.270
If we miss that,
we'll stand in line...

20
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.500
for, like, a day and a half,
and that's gonna kill me.

21
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.530
- OK!
- All right?

22
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:32.540
So let's go.

23
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.070
They're totally gonna dig this, man!

24
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.770
OK. Come on, it won't kill us to get
a deep-fried Snickers and a Coke.

25
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.250
Before ridin' Devil's Flight?
Yeah, that might kill me.

26
00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.410
No! What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger, man.

27
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:44.650
Ha ha ha!

28
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.870
- Unh!
- Ha ha!

29
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.200
Oh, I'll take that.

30
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.870
No. Come on, gimme.
It's not even mine, Kevin.

31
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.240
It's the yearbook's.
Just... Kevin.

32
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:07.240
Ha ha!

33
00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.940
- Oh!
- Oh, got it.

34
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.780
- Oh, my God, you're such an idiot.
- Hey. Hey. Gimme the...

35
00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.680
Ha ha!

36
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.910
- Ow!
- Nice.

37
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.650
Um, could you, like,
please delete that one of Stacy?

38
00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.050
Ha ha!

39
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.920
These are for the yearbook.

40
00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.080
And I have to turn them in tomorrow
to make a deadline...

41
00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.150
and, like, I doubt it if a shot of
Stacy Kobayashi's camel toe...

42
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.350
is gonna make it in there.

43
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.490
Whew. I'd buy two.

44
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:29.790
Ha ha ha!

45
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.200
Number 38, your order's ready.

46
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.260
That's us.

47
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.770
I am so sorry.

48
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.360
Kevin can get so out of control.

49
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.310
Let me just say
he would make me crazy.

50
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.740
Ha! I mean, you know
I'm such a control freak...

51
00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.540
like I couldn't handle that.

52
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.480
I'm breaking up with him.

53
00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.580
Couple of weeks.
After graduation.

54
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.950
I've been wanting to for a while.

55
00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.580
But don't tell anybody, OK?

56
00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:57.920
Whoa. Ha ha!

57
00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.720
Now, that shot there?
That'll sell some yearbooks.

58
00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.250
- I love it.
- I love it.

59
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.630
Oh! Oh, all right,
so I'm a total whore.

60
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.160
Come on, go, go, go,
go, go, go go!

61
00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.600
Oh, my God, Ashley, you're winning.
You're totally winning.

62
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.660
- Am I winning?
- Yeah, come on, hurry!

63
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.570
OK, come on, come on,
come on, come on!

64
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.180
Am I winning? Look around,
I don't want to look.

65
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.440
You're totally winning.

66
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.540
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on!

67
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.950
- Don't look!
- Oh, my God! Come on!

68
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.280
Oh, my God!
I'm winning! I'm winning!

69
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.150
Aah! Aah!

70
00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.250
- I won!
- I knew you would.

71
00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.920
Oh, my God! Gimme my prize.

72
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.490
- Good job.
- That was so awesome, Ashley.

73
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:35.590
Ashley.

74
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.630
Woo! Ha ha!

75
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.200
How ya doin', my brother?
You havin' a good time, huh?

76
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.830
- You like that?
- Ha ha!

77
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.780
Yeah! You like it.
Give it up. Give it up.

78
00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.680
Whoo-ooh!

79
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:53.980
Sam!

80
00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.080
Excuse me.

81
00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:04.520
You're not a senior.

82
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.960
And what are
you gonna do about it...

83
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.230
Miss "Cutest Couple,"
Rah Rah? Ha ha!

84
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.990
Mom know you're here?

85
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.730
You are a complete bitch
if you tell her.

86
00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.700
Proof where you were.

87
00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.370
Take a shot of this.

88
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:19.630
Ha ha ha!

89
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.270
Yeah! That's what I'm talking about.
That's three.

90
00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.180
♪ That is three, number three ♪

91
00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.120

Man, I am hot.

92
00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:34.310
- Man, gimme some right here, man.
- Right here! Right here!

93
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.520

Get the fuck back. Hoo!

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.860
My God, I am good. Here we go.

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:41.260
Boy, I'll tell ya...

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.090

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.430
Big prize. Watch out.

101
00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:51.500
Unh!

102
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.040

You want that blue one?

105

That's the one we gonna get.

106
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.950
Ha ha ha!

107
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:13.220
Ha ha ha ha!

108
00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:18.700
You can run, but you cannot hide.

109
00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:20.700
- Yes!
- Whoo! Here we are, baby.

110
00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:21.760
- Yes!
- Whoo!

111
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.830
- There it is.
- Awesome.

112
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:25.740
Here, get a pic of this. Ahhh!

113
00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:28.540
This is the beginning of the end.

114
00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:31.600
Ha ha ha!

115
00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:33.840
Hey, guys, get in line.

116
00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.680
Let's go on again!

117
00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:41.750
What's wrong?

118
00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.220
I'm...

119
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.420
I was having that feeling
like dejá vu, you know?

120
00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:50.760
Except for something
that hasn't happened yet.

121
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.860
Hey, J.

122
00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.130
Come on, man, let's go.

123
00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:55.160
- Yeah, yeah, hold on.
- Come on.

124
00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.670
What, are you weirded out
by the ride?

125
00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:01.530
'Cause, look, I know you.
And I think that maybe...

126
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.130
you're nervous about
this roller coaster...

127
00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:05.810
because they say the real fear
with these rides...

128
00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:09.150
comes from the feeling
of having no control.

129
00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:12.310
Everyone imagines weird stuff
when they get scared.

130
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:15.020
But it never turns out
to be what they imagine.

131
00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:16.550
Never.

132
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:18.990
OK.

133
00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:22.760
You can run, but you cannot hide.

134
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.490
Oh! Where you guys are right now
if you raise your hands and just...

135
00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:27.500
Ha... cup them slightly...

136
00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.940
it'll look you're holding
the devil's balls.

137
00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:31.800
And we'd wanna do that why?

138
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.170
When else you ever gonna see
a dick that big?

139
00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:35.470
I'm lookin' at one right now.

140
00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:40.040
Ha ha!
Man, you guys are smokin' hot.

141
00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.350
- Get out, Frankie.
- Yeah, why are you even here?

142
00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:44.180
Yeah, you graduated,
like, two years ago.

143
00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.580
I stuck around to monitor
your development.

144
00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:48.490
Yeah. Good to go.
Good to go, baby.

145
00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.510
Let's do it. Let's do it.
Come on. Come on.

146
00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.760
You may never return
from Devil's Flight.

147
00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:55.990
Ha ha ha ha!

148
00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:58.160
You're totally sad.

149
00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:03.840
Try not to scream!

150
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:06.810
Ha ha ha!

151
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:12.250
That was totally awesome!

152
00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.610
Yeah! Sweet!

153
00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:39.540
You all right?

154
00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:41.870
There's nothing to worry about.

155
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:44.100
A roller coaster
is just elemental physics.

156
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:47.170
A conversion of potential energy
to kinetic energy.

157
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.340
Yeah. Odds are like
one in 250 million...

158
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.720
of dying in a roller coaster.

159
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:53.080
Yeah, yeah,
thanks for that, McKinley.

160
00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.420
You're more likely to die
driving to an amusement park...

161
00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.450
than dying at one.

162
00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:01.220
Whoo! Heh.

163
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.200
Here we go.

164
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:13.740
Whoo!

165
00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.570
You like this?

166
00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:20.210
Won it on the Wacky Ladder.

167
00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:23.840
You know that ladder deal
that wobbles? Took it.

168
00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:26.620
I like this. It's old school.

169
00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:29.680
Frankie Cheeks
is old school, ladies.

170
00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.520
What's that?
Oh, well, it'd be my honor.

171
00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:34.550
Ew.

172
00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.500
Oh! Let's go.

173
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:38.160
Hey... Baby.

174
00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.130
- How many?
- Uh, 4.

175
00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:41.500
- 4.
- Yeah.

176
00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:42.870
Uh, gate one.

177
00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.170
- Yeah. Front car.
- Yes!

178
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:45.330
Wait... No. No, please.

179
00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:47.770
I'm sorry, I don't wanna be a hassle.
I just... I can't sit in the front.

180
00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:49.970
I cannot see the tracks. I'll freak.

181
00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:52.540
OK. Take it easy.

182
00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:55.640
Uh, well, Carrie will sit in
the back with you. Right, babe?

183
00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.680
Uh! Why me?
What? 'Cause we're girls?

184
00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:01.750
Fuck that. I'm going to Berkeley
and I won't get to do this for a while.

185
00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:02.980
I'm sitting in the front.

186
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:05.480
J, just go, OK? I'll live.

187
00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:05.820
You're not gonna sit by yourself.

188
00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:06.950
You're not gonna sit by yourself.

189
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:08.960
All right, you know what?
We'll just settle this like real men.

190
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.660
How about that? Hmm? Call it.

191
00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:30.730
Heads.

192
00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:34.330
Shit! Damn it.

193
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.770
All right, fine, what the fuck.
It's the same ride, right?

194
00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.600
Go. Go ahead. Bye, babe.

195
00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:42.160
Hey, uh, just do me a favor.

196
00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:44.010
Keep an eye on her, OK?
She's kinda freaked out.

197
00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.170
- Oh. Cool.
- All right?

198
00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:47.150
Yeah. Boom, buddy.
No problem.

199
00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:53.110
Ha ha ha!

200
00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.690
Aaah!

201
00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:13.140
Ohh!

202
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:23.240
Here we go. Hey!

203
00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.440
J! Keep your hands
to yourself, man.

204
00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:27.780
I'm serious. You know,
payback's a bitch, OK?

205
00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:29.620
You know, she might need
some comforting...

206
00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:31.250
and I'll be there for her. OK?

207
00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:33.560
Hey, no! No.
Get out. Get out.

208
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:34.990
Hey! Find another cockpit,
Top Gun.

209
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:36.720
No. Get...

210
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.790
Let's just get in the back, OK?

211
00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:41.990
Ha ha ha!

212
00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:44.130
Ahem.

213
00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:48.170
Guess who's back?

214
00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:49.770
- Ugh.
- Ugh.

215
00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:52.210
Hey!

216
00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:54.210
I'll meet you at the end.

217
00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.580
Here! All right!

218
00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:58.780
Cool!

219
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:02.280
Hey. How'd you guys
get in here?

220
00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.050
What? I'm 55 inches.

221
00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:05.560
- Sure. Come on out.
- Oh, man.

222
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:06.890
You, too. Out.

223
00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:08.120
- Ready?
- Ohh!

224
00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.560
I told you
we wouldn't get away with it.

225
00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.620
You OK?

226
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:13.190
Let's go on the bumper cars.

227
00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:15.170
Come on. Here we go.

228
00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:19.800
Yeah!

229
00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:25.700
What's up, man? I'm good.

230
00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:32.040
Dare you to, uh, flash me
them sweet, sweet titties...

231
00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:33.310
when we go through the loop.

232
00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:40.620
All right. Ha ha!

233
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.090
Yo! What, you can't read?

234
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:53.340
Oh. Well, can I just put it
in my pocket, man?

235
00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:54.400
- Is that cool?
- Yeah.

236
00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.430
Yeah? Cool.
Thanks, buddy. Sorry.

237
00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:06.640
Oh!

238
00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:08.520
Aw, shit!

239
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:13.080
Here you go!

240
00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:23.760
Whoo-ooh!

241
00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:27.330
Whoo! Win, baby!
Yes, baby! Win!

242
00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:29.170
Come on!

243
00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:31.010
Come on. Get hyped.

244
00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.340
The first hill's so high.

245
00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:33.810
Yeah.

246
00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:36.710
This is what we need!

247
00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:39.580
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

248
00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:40.850
Whoo!

249
00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:43.360
Whoo-hoo!

250
00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:45.480
- Let's do this!
- Just win!

251
00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:46.510
Ow!

252
00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:50.360
Whoo!

253
00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.430
Aw, yeah!

254
00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:18.020
Whoo!

255
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:25.930
Whoo! Shit!

256
00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:35.200
Aah!

257
00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.040
Oh, man.

258
00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.010
Oh, my God!

259
00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:40.030
Here we go!

260
00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:41.770
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

261
00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:43.080
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

262
00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.480
Aah!

263
00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:46.540
Yeah! Whoo!

264
00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:55.120
Aah!

265
00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.260
- Aah!
- Aah!

266
00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:02.960
Ha ha!

267
00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:07.300
Aah! Aah! Ha ha ha!

268
00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:09.300
Whoo!

269
00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:12.340
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

270
00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:14.780
Ha ha ha! Whoo!

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:31.160
Whoo!

274
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:38.430
Yeah! Show me your titties!

275
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:39.600
- Fuck off, Frankie!
- Oh!

276
00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:50.250
Aah!

277
00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:52.620
- Aah!
- Aah! Aah!

278
00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:56.120
Aah!

279
00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:00.690
Unh!

280
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:04.460
Oh, shit!

281
00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.120
- Aah!

282
00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:07.500
Aah!

283
00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:11.940
Oh, my God!
We're gonna fall off!

284
00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:13.460
Aah!

285
00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:18.210
No!

286
00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.220
- Aah!
- Aaah!

287
00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:35.390
Aah!

288
00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.290
Aah!

289
00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:41.130
Oh! Oh!

290
00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:48.270
Aah!

291
00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:52.210
Unh!

292
00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:55.200
Oh!

293
00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:56.710
- Yow!

294
00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:58.880
No!

295
00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:00.280
Aah!

296
00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:08.620
Whoa!

297
00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:10.950
Aah!

298
00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:14.660
No! Aah!

299
00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:27.240
Aah!

300
00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.110
Erin, hang on!

301
00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:31.510
Erin!

302
00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:33.040
- Hang on!
- Don't let go!

303
00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:34.050
I can't.

304
00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:36.180
Aah!

305
00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:37.850
Aah!

306
00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:39.380
No!

307
00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:41.550
Aah!

308
00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:43.360
Oh, God!

309
00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.950
Hang on, Wen.

310
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.900
Hang on! Help me rock it!

311
00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:54.530
Unh! Unh! Unh!

312
00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:58.140
Unh!

313
00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:01.800
Almost got it! Gently.

314
00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:13.490
Aaaah!

315
00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:18.130
No!

316
00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.760
Unh! Aah!

317
00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.770
Aah!

318
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
Let's settle this like real men.

319
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:29.000
Tales.

320
00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:30.000
What are you doing?

321
00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:33.000
I'm not getting on the ride 
Nobody's....

322
00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.130
Yo. What, you can't read?

323
00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:36.840
Oh, well. I'll just...
I'll put it in my pocket, OK?

324
00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:37.970
Yeah.

325
00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:39.530
Thanks, bro.

326
00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:40.910
Ahh. All right.
Let's do this, Wen...

327
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:42.810
What're you...?

328
00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:44.440
Here you go!

329
00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.710
Yeah! Let's do it, baby! Whoo!

330
00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:48.780
We have to get off of here.

331
00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:51.290
No, don't push the button!
Don't! Don't push the button!

332
00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.990
Unh! Let me off! Let me off!

333
00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:55.360
Wen, Wen! It's all right.
Jesus, it's gonna be over...

334
00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:57.120
No! It's gonna crash!
It's gonna crash!

335
00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.150
Wendy?

336
00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.790
The hydraulics will rupture!
The tracks'll collapse! Please!

337
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:03.300
- What's going on?
- Let me off!

338
00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:04.630
Chick's on somethin'.

339
00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:05.730
It's all right! You'll be OK!

340
00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:06.800
OK, let 'em out. Just the back.

341
00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:08.100
Wen. Hey! Wendy!

342
00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:11.340
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

343
00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:13.570
Relax. Now, what's the matter?

344
00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:16.010
I saw it. I saw it in my head.

345
00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:18.410
The tracks collapsed.
The roller coaster crashed.

346
00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:20.210
No, she was just a little upset before.

347
00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:22.280
Man, please, can you please
control that bitch?

348
00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:25.650
Damn. "It's gonna crash!
The hydraulics, the coaster!"

349
00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:27.680
Man, she's just trying to get
some fuckin' attention.

350
00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:29.460
You know what?
You're a real piece of shit, Lewis.

351
00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:30.960
- Fuck you.
- Fuck <i>moi?</i>

352
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.360
No, man, fuck you!
Don't touch me.

353
00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.370
Ow!

354
00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.390
Hey, hey!

355
00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:35.630
Unh!

356
00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:36.640
Just relax!

357
00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:37.970
Fight, man!

358
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.060
Hey. Hey. Let me out.

359
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:40.700
Nobody else gets off this ride!

360
00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.670
Dude, let me off.

361
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:44.010
So high school.

362
00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.170
Let's out.

363
00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:46.240
- Calm down!
- Get off of him!

364
00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:47.300
- Relax!
- Lan!

365
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:50.180
Where you ladies going?
There's a fight.

366
00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:53.810
Get him out of here!
Hey! Calm down! Relax!

367
00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:56.150
Dude, let me off.
I gotta make sure she's OK.

368
00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:58.420
- Relax! Calm down!
- ♪ Hey! Ho! Let's go ♪

369
00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.080
- Get your big ass off me, man!
- ♪ Hey, ho, let's go! ♪

370
00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:02.530

373
00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:08.500

374
00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:09.900
♪ Hey, ho ♪

375
00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:13.970
Dude, that's my girlfriend!

376
00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:15.000
Oh, my God!

377
00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.440
Whoo!

378
00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:18.440
Stop it! No! Stop it!

379
00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:22.450
Stop it! Please!
Please, the tracks are broken.

380
00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:25.450
Stop! Stop! Please!

381
00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:27.010
Jason!

382
00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:28.990
Hey, just relax, OK?

383
00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:31.350
- Please!
- Ease up, man. She's all right.

384
00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:32.520
OK? Just let her settle down.

385
00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.030
She can settle down at home!
Now listen...

386
00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:35.650
what is your home phone number?

387
00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.660
OK, we're gonna call your mother.
Everything will be taken care of...

388
00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:40.690
Aah!

389
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.900
Oh, my God! Jason!

390
00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:42.890
Ohh.

391
00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:23.100
Hey, Wendy!

392
00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:24.860
Hey!

393
00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:27.600
Wait! Wendy!

394
00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.230
Hey! Hey, Wen. Wait.

395
00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:30.970
I need... I need to talk to you
about something.

396
00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:32.810
Just here to pick up my diploma.

397
00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:34.110
You're not going to graduation?

398
00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:35.440
No.

399
00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:39.210
Look, you're not the only one
in a fucked up place, OK?

400
00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:41.910
God, I mean,
I just thought maybe...

401
00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:43.980
it'd be good for you to be somewhere
where other people feel the same way.

402
00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:45.010
At graduation?

403
00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:46.790
No. Thanks.
I've had enough funerals.

404
00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:48.220
Then do it for J and Carrie.

405
00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:50.090
Do what? If you die,
then there's nothing...

406
00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:52.460
then you're just dead,
and they don't know.

407
00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:53.760
And if they are up in Heaven
with Lincoln and Gandhi...

408
00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:56.270
do you think they really care about
our high school graduation? No.

409
00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:58.770
I am alive, and I don't care.

410
00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.100
As soon as I pull out
of that parking lot...

411
00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:02.440
I am so out of McKinley.

412
00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:03.840
Without J, what's here for me?

413
00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:05.870
I'm here. OK?

414
00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:09.350
I made a promise to J
that I would take care of you.

415
00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:12.210
On the ride. For 3 minutes.

416
00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:14.280
You weren't making
the promise for a lifetime.

417
00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.340
Kevin...

418
00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:18.010
if it wasn't for
you and J being friends...

419
00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:19.750
and me and Carrie being friends...

420
00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:22.450
we wouldn't have even hung out.

421
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:27.330
We don't even like each other.

422
00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:38.410
"Lan McKinley."

423
00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:40.880
How pathetic is it
that my last name...

424
00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:42.610
is the same as my high school?

425
00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:45.480
Julie, look who
I got to sign my yearbook.

426
00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:48.210
- No way. Nice.
- Yeah.

427
00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:58.130
I think we should invite her.

428
00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:59.650
- You think?
- Yeah.

429
00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:05.630
Wen? Um...

430
00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:08.230
So we're ready
for graduation tonight...

431
00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:10.670
we're going to
the tanning salon after this...

432
00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:13.140
and we are so totally cool
if you wanna come with.

433
00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:14.300
Totally.

434
00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:16.400
And just like, talk if you want.

435
00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:19.980
Here's my cell.

436
00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:22.280
I already have your number.

437
00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:26.550
That was so nice of us.

438
00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:37.900
You're not alone.

439
00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:39.770
God, I appreciate
everyone trying to help.

440
00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.030
OK? I really do.

441
00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:42.800
No, it's happened before.

442
00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:45.870
OK? I went online looking for
an explanation about...

443
00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:48.170
Wendy, just... just listen
to me, all right?

444
00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:51.240
All right, look, I went online
looking for an explanation...

445
00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:52.720
about what happened,
and I found out...

446
00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:55.280
about this high school
French class from New York.

447
00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:58.310
Six years ago
they went on a trip to Paris.

448
00:25:58.360 --> 00:25:59.650
When they were boarding...

449
00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:02.130
a kid had a vision that
the plane was gonna explode.

450
00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:05.220
Just like you did.

451
00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:06.820
He freaked out...

452
00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:09.260
and seven people
got off the plane.

453
00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:13.170
Just like us.

454
00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:18.900
And on takeoff,
Flight 180 blew up.

455
00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:21.280
And over the next several months...

456
00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:25.480
everyone who got off that plane
started dying in weird accidents.

457
00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.970
They died in the order they would've
if they had stayed on the plane.

458
00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:32.420
Unless someone intervened,
then it skipped them.

459
00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:35.020
Fuck you, Kevin.

460
00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:37.960
W-Wendy! Wendy! Hey!

461
00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.790
Ohh, every time we come here.

462
00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:08.050
I was thinking of going
for 20 minutes in the Muller.

463
00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:10.820
We did that for all the funerals
and it turned out amazing.

464
00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:12.300
Yeah, but that was just
a couple of weeks ago, though.

465
00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:13.890
I mean, we're still pretty bronzed.

466
00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:15.800
I was just thinking
we could go for, like, a tune-up.

467
00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:18.230
I just wanna make sure
that we look our best.

468
00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:19.530
Yeah.

469
00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:21.600
You know, for all those kids
that died that night...

470
00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.570
who will never get a graduation.

471
00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:26.870
You know what?
You're totally right.

472
00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:29.210
- I'm sorry.
- Mmm.

473
00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:55.130
This is my... my good guy
luck bracelet...

474
00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:57.400
that Grandma left me in her will.

475
00:27:58.740 --> 00:27:59.730
Ohh!

476
00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:01.840
Julie?

477
00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:05.550
I need...

478
00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:10.620
I could use some help.

479
00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:16.350
I have such...
such guilt over Jason.

480
00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:19.420
I should never have let
that ride go.

481
00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:22.960
God. I'm usually such
a control freak...

482
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.470
but I didn't do
enough to stop it.

483
00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:27.990
I should've done everything
I could to stop it.

484
00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:31.800
And I would give anything...

485
00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.970
to have a second chance.

486
00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:38.440
But I never can.

487
00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:45.850
I don't want to some day
feel that way about you, Julie.

488
00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:49.190
I mean,
I can't talk to Mom and Dad.

489
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:53.130
You're all I have left.

490
00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:56.630
You think when I find a place...

491
00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:58.900
maybe you could come stay
with me for a while?

492
00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:03.200
You know I will.

493
00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:06.900
You...

494
00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:10.440
keep this now...

495
00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:12.970
and I'll get it
when I come see you.

496
00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:17.990
Oh. And... hey,
how 'bout on your end?

497
00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:21.190
Can I use the school camera
for graduation tonight?

498
00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:24.060
Yeah. As long as you bring it back
to school on Monday.

499
00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:25.590
Done.

500
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:27.760
Oh. Um...

501
00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:29.230
Actually, the battery is pretty low...

502
00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:32.570
so why don't you go get ready,
and I'll recharge it a bit.

503
00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:34.160
Cool.

504
00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:50.550
In a hurry, Yuri.

505
00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:52.580
Sorry, sorry.
Cell phone signal is shit in here.

506
00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:54.590
I think tanning beds
mess with signal.

507
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:56.090
I must go outside.

508
00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:58.890
Why don't you just use that phone?

509
00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:01.900
I would, but she talks forever,
then my boss gives me shit.

510
00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:05.070
Shit. That's her.

511
00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:07.040
Ohh!

512
00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:08.160
You know what? Just go outside.

513
00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:09.540
We can deal with this ourselves.

514
00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:11.100
OK.

515
00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:17.110
Hey. No drinks in the room
this time, OK?

516
00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:18.170
Good.

517
00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:31.390
What are you doing?

518
00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:33.920
Nobody is walking in here
and seein' me naked.

519
00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:13.450
Oh, my God.

520
00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:26.070
Dude, he said no drinks.
If you spill that shit...

521
00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:27.910
we're gonna have to clean it
up like last time.

522
00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:30.070
Mmm!

523
00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:32.640
Happy, beyotch?
Nothing to spill.

524
00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:36.850
Why does Yuri keep it
so cold in here?

525
00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:39.750
Maybe it's supposed to be colder
for the machines or whatever.

526
00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:41.850
Oh, a few degrees won't hurt.

527
00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:27.170
Shit! I forgot my iPod.

528
00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:29.210
Sucks, bitch.

529
00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:31.420
They got CDs.

530
00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:36.850
Ew. Celine?

531
00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:38.290
Britney?

532
00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:40.530
Dude, are we like the only cool people

00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:43.470
Uh, yeah.

Ugh. Whatever.

535
00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:03.580
Why are you wearing underwear?

536
00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:05.850
Steinmetz says
he gets off on tan lines.

537
00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:08.380

I set it too hot in here.

00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:41.060
Hello?

584
00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:44.100
- Hey, Ashley, it's Wendy...
- Psych! Leave a message.

585
00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:46.840
Hi, Ashley, this is Wendy.

586
00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:47.900
Gimme a call whenever
you guys are done.

587
00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:48.910
Aah!

588
00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:50.810
And thanks again for the invite.

589
00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:52.910
- Someone help!
- Aah!

590
00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:56.850
Sorry I was too late.

591
00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:04.620
Aah!

592
00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:06.260
Aah! Aah!

593
00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:08.790
Aah! Aah! Aah!

594
00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:14.100
Aah! Aah! Aah!

595
00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:18.200
Aah! Aah!

596
00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:20.110
Oh! Oh!

597
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:21.610
Oh! Aah!

598
00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:23.710
Aaah! Aaah!

599
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:28.880
Hey, open the door!

600
00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:39.860
Help me!

601
00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:44.960
Aah!

602
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:51.270
Aah!

603
00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:54.300
Aah!

604
00:38:55.980 --> 00:39:00.350
We may feel that our lives
are not our own.

605
00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:04.380
That Death controls,
frames our lives.

606
00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:07.790
Our birth's nothing
but death begun.

607
00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:12.420
Yet, whether it is with
this tragic loss of young lives...

608
00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:15.870
which we have
suffered much of late...

609
00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:20.800
or with the soft passing
of the elderly in the night...

610
00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:25.470
we are all equal in Death's eyes.

611
00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:28.210
"Equal in Death's eyes?"

612
00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:30.200
All of us?
How can you say that?

613
00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:31.480
Shut up, McKinley.

614
00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:34.180
Dude, think it through.
Charlie Manson made it to 70.

615
00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:36.240
- Osama? Still kickin'.
- Let's go.

616
00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:38.980
Pimps, vice-presidents
walking around.

617
00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:41.720
- All the atrocities they've committed...
- Let's just go. Come on.

618
00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:43.020
They're alive and well.

619
00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:47.120
These two girls, who'd never
done shit to anybody...

620
00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:49.360
- Shh!
- They don't get to make it to 18?

621
00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:51.030
Where's the fucking
equality in that?

622
00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:53.340
- What?
- Come on, man.

623
00:39:53.370 --> 00:39:55.030
I can... Yeah. Fine.

624
00:39:55.070 --> 00:39:56.700
Fine. All right. All right.

625
00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:58.500
I'm fine. All right.

626
00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:00.310
That's crazy.

627
00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:05.080
Those of you who would like
to pay a final remembrance...

628
00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:08.280
please step forward at this time.

629
00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:17.990
I so feel this is so my fault.

630
00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:20.500
How could it possibly be your fault?

631
00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:23.630
Seein' women as nothin' but fun bags.

632
00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:27.660
I mean... if I'd've seen their...

633
00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:30.500
whatever... humanity...

634
00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:33.600
they wouldn't have felt
the pressure to look so good.

635
00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:38.050
Impress Franklin Cheeks.
Go on diets. Deodorize.

636
00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:41.450
Stretch. Tan.

637
00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:44.080
Don't be down, Frankie.

638
00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:45.890
Be proud of your ability
to make everything...

639
00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:48.190
that happens somehow
a story about you.

640
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.330
God!

641
00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:07.140
Yo, man.
These things really suck, man.

642
00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:09.410
Fucking boring.

643
00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:12.280
Hey, if you ever have
to come to my funeral...

644
00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:14.050
man, bring me a PSP or somethin'.

645
00:41:14.090 --> 00:41:15.750
'Least I have somethin' to do then.

646
00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:22.560
Whew.

647
00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:25.290
Hello?

648
00:41:25.330 --> 00:41:26.890
I'm with J.

649
00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:56.190
What are you doing up here
in the nosebleeds?

650
00:41:57.700 --> 00:41:59.630
You know, I could've
gotten you second row.

651
00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:02.900
I didn't want to upset
anyone by being there.

652
00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:07.100
And I wondered if
maybe here I could feel J's...

653
00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:11.070
spirit or presence or...

654
00:42:11.110 --> 00:42:13.100
whatever.

655
00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:15.940
But now that I'm here...

656
00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:19.580
if there's any place that makes me feel
like there's no life after death...

657
00:42:21.250 --> 00:42:23.220
it's a cemetery.

658
00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:28.090
Yeah, I haven't felt
Carrie's spirit either.

659
00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:30.860
And I've tried.

660
00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:33.830
Real hard. Heh.

661
00:42:36.570 --> 00:42:39.630
I thought maybe
he's been with me since...

662
00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:45.770
that night...
before I got on the ride...

663
00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:47.710
Jason said...

664
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:49.340
God, and it was just
to get me on the ride...

665
00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:51.180
he said...

666
00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:55.780
"Your fear is from a sense
of having no control."

667
00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:58.520
And I've felt that fear
since the moment he said it.

668
00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:02.490
Even thought it maybe somehow
caused the hallucination...

669
00:43:02.530 --> 00:43:07.120
but this fear is more
than just being scared.

670
00:43:07.170 --> 00:43:09.730
It's like a presence.

671
00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:13.670
Like a living thing
always with me.

672
00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:16.830
You think it's J?

673
00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:18.400
No, I know it's not.

674
00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:23.310
This presence is the opposite
of how J made me feel.

675
00:43:23.350 --> 00:43:27.650
It's cold and terrifying.

676
00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:05.950
That's the last photograph
Lincoln posed for.

677
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:07.480
The photographic plate
was broken...

678
00:44:07.530 --> 00:44:09.890
causing a line
that can't be removed.

679
00:44:09.930 --> 00:44:11.760
Exactly where he was shot.

680
00:44:13.930 --> 00:44:15.800
Look. See the shadow?

681
00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:20.030
But what do these pictures
have to do with us?

682
00:44:20.070 --> 00:44:23.440
Look. This occurred
one year to the day...

683
00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:25.530
of the Flight 180 disaster.
Look at the road sign.

684
00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:27.600
Look, I guess you came
to me with this...

685
00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:29.940
because I'm responsible
for putting this in your head...

686
00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:31.210
with the Flight 180 thing.

687
00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:33.270
And it did happen,
and it may be occurring here...

688
00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:35.080
but you can't believe
every weird thing out there...

689
00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:36.250
because you're desperate
for an answer.

690
00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:38.190
I took these.

691
00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:40.190
That night.

692
00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:48.930
These?

693
00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:53.760
Are these it?

694
00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:01.300
Oh, shit.

695
00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:04.780
Oh... shit.

696
00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:07.910
Ohh.

697
00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:12.010
Whoa, whoa, hey.
You all right?

698
00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:13.680
I'm feeling a little woozy.

699
00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:17.290
When was the last time you ate?

700
00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:20.120
I don't remember.

701
00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:22.990
All right, come on. I'll drive.

702
00:45:27.370 --> 00:45:31.070
OK, those kids on Flight 180
died in accidents...

703
00:45:31.110 --> 00:45:33.440
in the order they would've died
if they'd have stayed on the plane.

704
00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:36.110
OK?
So if this is that, then...

705
00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:39.440
then Frankie was behind
Ashlyn and Ashley.

706
00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:42.020
When I saw Ashley
and Ashlyn's picture...

707
00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:44.080
I felt this instinct.

708
00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:45.850
Like there was a hint
in the picture. I even...

709
00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:48.360
I even called to see if
I could keep them from going.

710
00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:49.620
Well, what's
Frankie's picture look like?

711
00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:50.680
It's right here.

712
00:45:50.730 --> 00:45:53.060
- You got it?
- Yeah.

713
00:45:56.070 --> 00:45:57.560
- Wait! Watch out!
- Oh!

714
00:45:57.600 --> 00:45:59.660
Hey! Hey! Are you crazy?

715
00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:01.730
Sorry!

716
00:46:04.210 --> 00:46:06.040
All right,
let's just eat over there.

717
00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:07.310
And go through
the drive through.

718
00:46:07.350 --> 00:46:08.540
I don't want anyone hearing
what we're talking about.

719
00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:10.270
Well, it's nice to see
that things haven't made you...

720
00:46:10.310 --> 00:46:11.680
any less of a control freak.

721
00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:21.780
- You got it?
- Yeah, all right.

722
00:46:21.830 --> 00:46:22.850
Here's Frank's picture.

723
00:46:22.890 --> 00:46:24.420
All right.

724
00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:26.830
Well, this is obvious.
He's falling off a ladder.

725
00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:29.770
A rope ladder, though.
Maybe he might hang.

726
00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:33.460
Look, or maybe it's not that literal.
All right, what's...

727
00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:34.730
Could there be anything
in these prizes?

728
00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:37.470
Oh, what, like he's gonna get
crushed by a giant Spongebob?

729
00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:40.840
Hey, Spongebob lives underwater.

730
00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:44.800
It's so sad that you know that.

731
00:46:44.850 --> 00:46:46.870
All right. He won that tacky
mud-flap girl chain...

732
00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:48.480
on this game, though, so...

733
00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:50.490
aren't those usually
on those big 18 wheelers?

734
00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:51.780
Yeah. Yeah.

735
00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:53.690
God, I don't see it in
this picture anywhere though.

736
00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:57.960
All right! God.

737
00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:02.430
All right.

738
00:47:06.170 --> 00:47:07.330
Uh, can I take your order?

739
00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:09.200
Yeah. What do you want?

740
00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:15.710
Are you OK?

741
00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:26.480
Please tell me
there's a short in your wiring.

742
00:47:28.930 --> 00:47:31.860
Whoa. Whoa. That guy's
way too close to my truck.

743
00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:33.990
Hey, you're too fucking
close, man! Pull up!

744
00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:35.620

We're all done here.
You need a ride?

773
00:49:40.070 --> 00:49:42.540
Um, we can walk to my house...

774
00:49:42.570 --> 00:49:44.940
and then I'll give you
a ride to yours.

775
00:49:46.310 --> 00:49:47.570
No, thanks. We'll be OK.

776
00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:53.640
Will we?

777
00:49:56.090 --> 00:49:57.520
Yeah. We'll be all right.

778
00:49:57.550 --> 00:50:00.080
I mean...

779
00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:02.220
how Frank...

780
00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:04.060
God, it... it's not only horrible...

781
00:50:04.090 --> 00:50:07.330
but can you feel...
can you feel how vicious it was?

782
00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:08.730
Easy.

783
00:50:08.770 --> 00:50:10.700
OK? Easy.

784
00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:13.990
Let's just...

785
00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:15.870
let's just take a step back.

786
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:19.540
All right? He was behind
Ashley and Ashlyn on the ride...

787
00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:21.670
but there was no ladder here.
You know, there was no rope.

788
00:50:21.710 --> 00:50:24.240
Nothing in that picture pointed to this.

789
00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:26.040
We were wrong about the photos.

790
00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:28.950
I should've left town.
It's better not knowing.

791
00:50:28.990 --> 00:50:31.980
No, it's never better
staying ignorant.

792
00:50:32.020 --> 00:50:34.080
Willful ignorance
is surrendering control.

793
00:50:35.090 --> 00:50:38.890
What, did you read that somewhere
in Mrs. Brooks' English class?

794
00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:42.790
No. L... you know, I'm not...

795
00:50:42.830 --> 00:50:45.200
I'm not the total idiot
you think I am.

796
00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:48.740
OK, that's Lewis after Frank...

797
00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:50.830
then lan and Erin.

798
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:53.000
There's a couple of kids behind them,
but I can't make them out...

799
00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:55.100
because this guy's arm's
in the way. Can you?

800
00:50:55.150 --> 00:50:56.130
No.

801
00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:58.050
All right, you know what?

802
00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:00.520
We'll ask Lewis, lan, and Erin
if they remember.

803
00:51:00.550 --> 00:51:02.110
OK?

804
00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:04.680
Are there any more pictures
from the roller coaster?

805
00:51:17.970 --> 00:51:20.700
I guess...

806
00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:22.300
that kind of thing
is gonna happen to us

807
00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:23.530
for the rest of our lives.

808
00:51:23.570 --> 00:51:25.170
Yeah.

809
00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:28.940
You know, I was gonna...

810
00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:31.140
I was gonna ask her to marry me.

811
00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:34.680
Right after graduation.

812
00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:36.520
Heh.

813
00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:50.070
Oh.

814
00:51:56.140 --> 00:51:58.110
No, wait.

815
00:51:58.140 --> 00:51:59.570
Look, behind Stacy.

816
00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:01.770
That's Frank.

817
00:52:02.910 --> 00:52:04.510
This picture shows how he died.

818
00:52:09.550 --> 00:52:11.910
All right, go back to Lewis.

819
00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:15.360
OK, he's got that hammer.

820
00:52:15.390 --> 00:52:18.260
And the weight looks like
it's coming down...

821
00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:20.090
on his head.

822
00:52:20.130 --> 00:52:21.120
No, no, no, check this out.

823
00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:24.260
Right now Lewis is down at State
for football training camp.

824
00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:26.700
State's team is called the Sultans.

825
00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:28.360
That's it. That's the clue.

826
00:52:28.410 --> 00:52:31.370
We have to tell him.
Show him these pictures.

827
00:52:35.650 --> 00:52:36.670
Wouldn't you want to know?

828
00:52:38.250 --> 00:52:39.610
Wait, there's pictures of us in there?

829
00:52:39.650 --> 00:52:41.340
Yeah.

830
00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:42.650
Yeah, of course.

831
00:52:42.690 --> 00:52:44.680
Huh. No.

832
00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:47.490
No. I don't want to see mine.
No. Huh.

833
00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:48.820
What about willful ignorance?

834
00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:51.520
Well, I'm full of shit, all right?!

835
00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:53.260
I mean, I never thought
I could see my own death...

836
00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:54.560
before it happened, Wendy.

837
00:52:55.730 --> 00:52:57.890
No, you know what?
We can tell Lewis, but...

838
00:52:57.930 --> 00:53:00.900
Seriously, if there's any way
to beat this thing...

839
00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:02.530
I gotta stay focused...

840
00:53:02.570 --> 00:53:04.130
and if I look at that picture,
all I'm gonna do is obsess.

841
00:53:04.170 --> 00:53:06.730
So, you know what?
No, I don't want to see it.

842
00:53:08.850 --> 00:53:11.010
I mean, unless we have to.

843
00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:14.750
You mean until we have to.

844
00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:22.350
One more thing.

845
00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:24.360
Is it bad?

846
00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:27.660
I mean, is it, like,
painful or embarrassing?

847
00:53:27.930 --> 00:53:30.200
I mean, there's nothing, like,
up my ass or anything, right?

848
00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:31.830
I'll see you tomorrow.

849
00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:10.370
You on crack. Both of you.

850
00:54:10.410 --> 00:54:12.740
Just listen, OK?
Ashley and Ashlyn were first.

851
00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:14.400
Then Frankie Cheeks
and then you. This is the...

852
00:54:14.450 --> 00:54:15.970
- Aw, come on, Kevin.
- Listen.

853
00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:17.500
McKinley and Erin
were next, all right?

854
00:54:17.550 --> 00:54:19.680
And there were two people in front of us.
Do you remember who they were?

855
00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:21.980
Fuck no, and I don't care.
And you shouldn't care either, man...

856
00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:24.320
'cause what you're tellin' me
right now is straight bullshit.

857
00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:25.410
Just listen, Lewis.

858
00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:27.820
Kevin, it's like those stories.

859
00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:31.690
Like this guy was killed
by a car he sold 10 years ago.

860
00:54:31.730 --> 00:54:35.030
Two sisters, right, were killed when
they were driving to visit each other.

861
00:54:35.070 --> 00:54:37.190
You know, shit like that, man.

862
00:54:37.230 --> 00:54:38.700
Fuck the Bruins!

863
00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:40.970
Oh, yeah! Fuck the Bruins!

864
00:54:41.010 --> 00:54:42.770
Bruin faggots!

865
00:54:42.810 --> 00:54:44.400
Yeah! Fuck the Bruins!

866
00:54:47.410 --> 00:54:50.740
Man, you're reading into this shit
like them damn urban legends.

867
00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:52.750
Three people have died, Lewis.

868
00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:54.110
I mean, if you think
this can be written off...

869
00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:56.120
as a simple coincidence
and it ends there...

870
00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:57.980
you're in serious denial.

871
00:54:58.020 --> 00:54:59.510
Unh! What about you two, huh?

872
00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:00.820
What?

873
00:55:00.860 --> 00:55:03.990
You both lost people real close
to you in a fucked-up way.

874
00:55:04.030 --> 00:55:05.960
And in order to feel
less guilty or whatever...

875
00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:07.730
seeing signs and patterns, man.

876
00:55:07.770 --> 00:55:11.530
I don't blame you.
But it's wrong, dawg.

877
00:55:11.570 --> 00:55:14.060
Unh! It's wrong.

878
00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:17.300
That's denial.

879
00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:19.170
Unh!

880
00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:22.540
- Unh!
- You got it!

881
00:55:22.580 --> 00:55:24.840
OK, what about what happened
at the roller coaster? Huh?

882
00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:25.870
Wendy saw it.

883
00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:28.780
Man, she got a hunch.
Fuckin' intense, but she got a hunch.

884
00:55:28.820 --> 00:55:31.250
Man, I'm here because I get
good hunches before every down.

885
00:55:31.290 --> 00:55:33.280
No, you know
they're either gonna run or pass.

886
00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:34.920
Hers came to her from nowhere.

887
00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:36.690
You're here and alive because of her.

888
00:55:36.730 --> 00:55:38.220
No, I'm alive because of me.

889
00:55:38.260 --> 00:55:39.790
No, listen.
You don't get it, man.

890
00:55:39.830 --> 00:55:41.200
Does that make sense to you?

891
00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:43.030
There's nothing to get, Kevin!
It's bullshit.

892
00:55:43.070 --> 00:55:44.830
No, just hear me out, all right?

893
00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:45.890
Unh.

894
00:55:45.940 --> 00:55:47.300
♪ Yeah ♪

895
00:55:52.510 --> 00:55:55.540
Talk about a vision.
Man, I seen my whole life played out...

896
00:55:55.580 --> 00:55:57.980
and it sure as hell
ain't gonna end now. Unh!

897
00:55:58.020 --> 00:55:59.240
It's going just as I saw it.

898
00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:02.510
35 high school games
without an injury.

899
00:56:02.550 --> 00:56:04.890
- <i>USA Today</i> All-American.
- Second team.

900
00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:06.890
- Free ride to play for the Sultans!
- The Bruins passed on you.

901
00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:08.450
Man, fuck the Bruins!

902
00:56:08.490 --> 00:56:09.980
- Fuck 'em!
- You goddamn right!

903
00:56:10.030 --> 00:56:12.090
What the fuck is a Bruin anyway?

904
00:56:12.130 --> 00:56:13.720
Aah!

905
00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:16.100
Unh! Unh! Unh!

906
00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:17.730
Four years from now...

907
00:56:17.770 --> 00:56:20.290
Lewis Romero goin' in
the second round to Oakland.

908

Unh!

909
00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:24.170
He's gonna romp and stomp.

910
00:56:24.210 --> 00:56:28.200
15 seasons, with four Super Bowl
rings on his fingers.

911
00:56:28.250 --> 00:56:30.370
Lewis ain't afraid of no death.
Fuck Death!

912
00:56:30.410 --> 00:56:32.810
Death is a fuckin' Denver fan.

913
00:56:32.850 --> 00:56:34.550
Death wear blue and orange.

914
00:56:34.590 --> 00:56:37.380
Real men wear black.

915
00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:38.580
Lewis ain't afraid of no Death.

916
00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:40.920
Death is afraid of me!

917
00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:42.430
Death fears me!

918
00:56:42.460 --> 00:56:43.690
Kevin.

919
00:56:43.730 --> 00:56:45.820
'Cause, baby, I just win.
I just win, Kevin!

00:56:45.860 --> 00:56:49.770
That's all I know how to do!
I just win! Unh!

921
00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:51.100
Fuck Death!

922
00:56:51.140 --> 00:56:53.070
- Fuck the Bruins!
- Yeah!

923
00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:55.000
Aah!

924
00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:56.470
- Look out!
- Lewis!

925
00:56:58.610 --> 00:57:00.080
Man, that was close, Lewis.

926
00:57:00.110 --> 00:57:02.100
Hey, did you see that?

927
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:05.600
Whoo! What I tell you,
Kevin, huh?

928
00:57:05.650 --> 00:57:07.580
Fuck Death! I just win!

929
00:57:07.620 --> 00:57:09.020
That's all I know
how to do, Kevin.

930
00:57:09.050 --> 00:57:10.150
Baby, I just win!

931
00:57:11.290 --> 00:57:12.380
Aaaaah!

932
00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:14.720
- Ooooh!
- God!

933
00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:26.940
Did I do something...

934
00:57:29.110 --> 00:57:30.800
to bring this on everybody?

935
00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:32.930
Don't, Wendy.

936
00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:35.970
But why me?

937
00:57:36.010 --> 00:57:38.280
All those people out there
wanting to have a premonition...

938
00:57:38.310 --> 00:57:41.150
or see a ghost or whatever,
and I don't.

939
00:57:44.250 --> 00:57:47.020
I just want it to stop.

940
00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:48.890
Just stop.

941
00:57:48.930 --> 00:57:51.620
I don't know why, Wendy...

942
00:57:51.660 --> 00:57:54.220
but you didn't do anything.

943
00:57:55.370 --> 00:57:57.890
All right? This is just...

944
00:57:57.930 --> 00:57:59.830
I don't know. I mean,
I wish I knew why, you know?

945
00:57:59.870 --> 00:58:02.600
I wish I could... I could
come up with a guess even...

946
00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:04.830
to make you feel OK, but...

947
00:58:07.310 --> 00:58:09.710
You know, I can't.

948
00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:13.410
Yeah.

949
00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:16.080
There's nothing I can do.

950
00:58:20.460 --> 00:58:21.890
Can you drive?

951
00:58:22.890 --> 00:58:24.480
Heh.

952
00:58:24.530 --> 00:58:25.790
Yeah.

953
00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:32.190
You know, by the way,
that... that picture of me.

954
00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:36.540
My, uh, my head's not, like,
through the windshield or anything?

955
00:58:36.570 --> 00:58:38.940
You know,
crushed by a steering wheel?

956
00:58:38.980 --> 00:58:40.810
Impaled by a gear shift?

957
00:58:44.150 --> 00:58:45.310
Right?

958
00:58:59.060 --> 00:59:00.760
Zip, it's Pip.

959
00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:02.230
Have you cut
those plywood orders yet?

960
00:59:02.270 --> 00:59:03.760
Uh, that's a big no, Pip.

961
00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:07.170
Osama bin Supervisor wants me
to get rid of these pigeons first.

962
00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:08.800
They keep settin' off the alarms.

963
00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:23.940
Hello, babies.

964
00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:52.620
Ha ha ha!

965
00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:56.560
Oh, ha ha ha! Heh.

966
01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:03.700
Hey. After I, uh, restock
this stuff...

967
01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:05.730
that these pinhead customers
can't manage...

968
01:00:05.770 --> 01:00:07.670
to return to the shelves
themselves...

969
01:00:07.710 --> 01:00:09.110
we can blow out of here, OK?

970
01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:10.770
Righty-o, babe.

971
01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:16.240
Aah!

972
01:00:16.290 --> 01:00:18.010
Erin, it's Wendy and Kevin.

973
01:00:18.050 --> 01:00:19.650
Shit!

974
01:00:19.690 --> 01:00:21.590
You scared the shit out of me!

975
01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:23.820
Yeah, wait till you hear
what we have to tell you.

976
01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:35.340
Zip, it's Pip. Come over here.

977
01:00:35.370 --> 01:00:38.100
You are gonna trip
when you hear this.

978
01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:41.340
Well, paint me intrigued, Pip.
I'm on my way.

979
01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:44.810
So let me get this straight.
I'm gonna O.D. On nail polish...

980
01:00:44.850 --> 01:00:47.820
and lan is gonna be
embarrassed to death?

981
01:00:47.850 --> 01:00:49.480
You saw what happened
to Wendy, right?

982
01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:52.420
What's happened to the others?
I mean, you just saw their pictures.

983
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.430
Oh, my God, guys,
what's going on?

984
01:01:05.470 --> 01:01:08.730
What's going on?
That's crazy! That's crazy!

985
01:01:08.770 --> 01:01:10.600
Ha ha!

986
01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:14.400
We need to know who was sitting
behind you on the roller coaster.

987
01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:17.810
OK, who was sitting behind us
on the roller coaster?

988
01:01:17.850 --> 01:01:20.820
Oh! Oh, wait! Wasn't it
that one guy who got voted...

989
01:01:20.850 --> 01:01:23.680
most likely to become
manager at Red Lobster?

990
01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:24.910
Oh, no. You know what?
God, I remember.

991
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:26.720
There was this guy,
uh, black cloak...

992
01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:28.280
I didn't see his face, but, um...

993
01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:30.520
the ride attendant
did take his sickle...

994
01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:33.930
before the ride started
if that's helpful in any way.

995
01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:35.830
Do you think we care
if you laugh at us?

996
01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:37.350
This is our lives, OK?

997
01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:39.660
What choice do we have?
Just give into it?

998
01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:41.500
Oh, God. You know what?
There is no "it."

999
01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:44.440
OK, wait, are you guys saying
that Death is, like, a person?

1000
01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:47.100
No. It's like... like a force.

1001
01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:50.840
Yeah. Well, you know what?
A force is just a force.

1002
01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:53.350
It's nothing else.
Just transferred energy.

1003
01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:56.840
I mean, it has no goals,
no awareness that is a force.

1004
01:01:56.890 --> 01:01:58.550
But there is awareness, McKinley.

1005
01:01:58.590 --> 01:02:01.020
In fact, in past cases,
if the next in line is saved...

1006
01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:03.320
it'd skip that person.
That's why we're here.

1007
01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:05.120
Oh, man,
what have you been smoking?

1008
01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:09.390
Ha ha!

1009
01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:14.170
- Top shelf.
- OK.

1010
01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:24.910
Kevin! Those banners.
They're in the picture.

1011
01:02:26.550 --> 01:02:28.070
Lan, watch those boxes!

1012
01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:36.050
What the fuck, man?
You said those boxes were falling!

1013
01:02:36.090 --> 01:02:37.850
No, I said watch the boxes.

1014
01:02:37.890 --> 01:02:39.520
Really? What for?
They're not doing anything.

1015
01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:42.500
We're not gonna apologize
for trying to save you.

1016
01:02:42.530 --> 01:02:46.400
You haven't seen or been through
what we have... yet.

1017
01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:48.030
Oh. Yet.

1018
01:02:48.070 --> 01:02:51.300
OK, so who's next in this theory
you have, me or lan?

1019
01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:53.710
Well, we know the order of how
we were sitting on the roller coaster...

1020
01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:56.180
but not how it works
with people who sat together.

1021
01:02:56.210 --> 01:02:59.010
OK, we don't know
if Ashley or Ashlyn died first.

1022
01:02:59.050 --> 01:03:01.680
Hmm. God, Death is
fucking complicated.

1023
01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:03.150
Ha ha!

1024
01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:05.280
No, you know what?
It's not complicated.

1025
01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:07.880
It's simple. People die.

1026
01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:09.320
That's just part of life.

1027
01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:12.120
150,000 people a day, actually.

1028
01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:14.060
You know? I mean...

1029
01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:16.120
we're biological entities,
and death is just...

1030
01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:18.460
- Top shelf.
- The end of biological function.

1031
01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:19.490
It's as simple as that.

1032
01:03:26.410 --> 01:03:28.880
How can you explain
what happened to us as simple?

1033
01:03:28.910 --> 01:03:30.710
I mean, if Wendy never had
that premonition...

1034
01:03:30.750 --> 01:03:33.240
and none of us had gotten off that ride,
we'd all be dead right now.

1035
01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:35.610
- Does that not make sense to you?
- Oh, yeah.

1036
01:03:35.650 --> 01:03:39.550
Kevin, how come when a guy dies
of a plain heart attack...

1037
01:03:39.590 --> 01:03:41.220
no one goes, like...

1038
01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:44.380
"Oh, wow, he was
eating French toast...

1039
01:03:44.430 --> 01:03:46.220
"when Princess Diana
died in Paris...

1040
01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:49.420
"and then he saw her funeral on TV,
and now he's dead"?

1041
01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:50.990
You know why?
Because they'd sound crazy...

1042
01:03:51.030 --> 01:03:54.490
so guess how you two
sound right now? Crazy.

1043
01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:56.940
Zip, I'm done.
So finish cutting those orders...

1044
01:03:56.970 --> 01:03:58.300
- so we can get out of here.
- OK!

1045
01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:47.310
Unh!

1046
01:04:49.830 --> 01:04:50.810
Heh heh!

1047
01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:05.270
Ugh!

1048
01:05:05.310 --> 01:05:06.900
Sick.

1049
01:05:42.180 --> 01:05:44.010
OK.

1050
01:05:44.050 --> 01:05:46.010
Let's go with
what you guys are saying.

1051
01:05:46.050 --> 01:05:47.340
Let's just say, you know...

1052
01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:49.820
that Death does have
a conscious plan...

1053
01:05:49.850 --> 01:05:52.180
and that it's been
set into motion. Great.

1054
01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:55.380
So, Newton's third law of motion,
and, well, look...

1055
01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:57.250
I'm just guessing
that it goes for Death, too...

1056
01:05:57.290 --> 01:05:59.120
when he's working in our world.

1057
01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:03.100
Newton says that every action
has an equal and opposite reaction.

1058
01:06:03.130 --> 01:06:06.190
So, that means that...

1059
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:10.140
if Death has taken action,
so can we.

1060
01:06:10.170 --> 01:06:12.370
And that that action
we take might have...

1061
01:06:12.410 --> 01:06:14.970
an opposite reaction
that thwarts Death's intent.

1062
01:06:15.010 --> 01:06:16.740
You're being a fucker, but go on.

1063
01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:19.640
OK. OK.

1064
01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:22.910
What if, for example...

1065
01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:27.750
the last in line were to make
the utilitarian choice...

1066
01:06:29.090 --> 01:06:30.250
Kill themselves.

1067
01:06:32.430 --> 01:06:34.860
Wow! Wow! That's pretty much
gonna ruin any plan...

1068
01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:37.590
that Death's put in motion.
And even better...

1069
01:06:37.630 --> 01:06:41.500
hey, it's gonna save
five skipped lives.

1070
01:06:47.610 --> 01:06:49.200
Any takers?

1071
01:06:51.810 --> 01:06:54.110
Nah, I didn't think so.

1072
01:07:03.790 --> 01:07:05.260
There! Those!

1073
01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:10.490
Ugh!

1074
01:07:10.530 --> 01:07:11.900
Aah!

1075
01:07:14.570 --> 01:07:16.130
Ooh!

1076
01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:24.430
Aah!

1077
01:07:25.450 --> 01:07:26.440
Unh! Unh!

1078
01:07:28.650 --> 01:07:29.880
Unh!

1079
01:07:43.130 --> 01:07:45.390
Aah!

1080
01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:06.280
I didn't say anything.
I mean, I think...

1081
01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:07.790
they were trying to scare us
into saying something...

1082
01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:09.810
but they had nothing
to keep me there.

1083
01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:11.290
What'd you tell 'em?

1084
01:08:11.330 --> 01:08:13.560
Everything.
I didn't do anything.

1085
01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:15.390
I told them about
the pictures in the camera...

1086
01:08:15.430 --> 01:08:16.590
and Flight 180
and Frankie and Lewis...

1087
01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:19.000
and why we went to see
lan and Erin and...

1088
01:08:19.030 --> 01:08:20.470
Did they believe you?

1089
01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:22.530
Yeah, right.
Would you believe me?

1090
01:08:22.570 --> 01:08:25.060
No, they looked at me
like I was crazy.

1091
01:08:25.110 --> 01:08:27.540
10 hours they had us in there.

1092
01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:28.940
For all we know...

1093
01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:30.840
whoever was sitting
behind Erin is already dead.

1094
01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:32.440
And we're next.

1095
01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:34.000
Now.

1096
01:08:36.850 --> 01:08:40.950
Lan almost died first,
but we intervened.

1097
01:08:40.990 --> 01:08:44.360
So it skipped lan.
That's... that's how we regain control.

1098
01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:45.690
If someone intercedes...

1099
01:08:45.730 --> 01:08:47.590
the life that was supposed
to be next is skipped.

1100
01:08:47.630 --> 01:08:48.860
All right, wait, wait, wait.

1101
01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:51.390
So, going by the way we sat
on the roller coaster...

1102
01:08:52.870 --> 01:08:56.030
Well, I'm next... and then you.

1103
01:08:56.070 --> 01:08:59.230
We can beat this.

1104
01:08:59.270 --> 01:09:02.040
We're so close.
We can't give up.

1105
01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:06.510
All right, my dad's here.
He's gonna give me a ride back.

1106
01:09:06.550 --> 01:09:09.520
But are you sure
we shouldn't stick together?

1107
01:09:09.550 --> 01:09:11.420
It's just for a couple of hours.

1108
01:09:11.450 --> 01:09:12.440
All right? A couple of hours.

1109
01:09:12.490 --> 01:09:15.420
Go back, look at the pictures,
see if you can find any more clues...

1110
01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:19.190
and I'll ask everybody I see if they know
if anyone else got off the ride.

1111
01:09:19.230 --> 01:09:21.290
OK?

1112
01:09:23.630 --> 01:09:25.930
Was there something
I should know about going?

1113
01:09:27.770 --> 01:09:29.930
No, it's just...

1114
01:09:29.970 --> 01:09:32.460
I'll just be freaking out
every second...

1115
01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:34.440
hoping you're OK.

1116
01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:36.470
Why?

1117
01:09:37.750 --> 01:09:39.680
I mean,
we don't even like each other.

1118
01:09:39.710 --> 01:09:42.340
Heh.

1119
01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:44.910
Come here.

1120
01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:51.150
OK?

1121
01:09:51.190 --> 01:09:52.950
All right, I got my cell.

1122
01:09:52.990 --> 01:09:54.290
OK.

1123
01:10:12.410 --> 01:10:13.670
Hey, Wen?

1124
01:10:13.710 --> 01:10:15.480
So we're meeting some guys
at that centennial thing...

1125
01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:19.680
and I could really use
my good-luck... bracelet.

1126
01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:37.490
Mmm.

1127
01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:50.340
Huh.

1128
01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:24.450
Hey, this is Julie.
Leave a message.

1129
01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:26.380
Call me on my cell right away.

1130
01:11:31.930 --> 01:11:33.190
Hello?

1131
01:11:33.230 --> 01:11:35.130
Do you remember Julie
being on the roller coaster?

1132
01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:36.990
What, your sister? No.

1133
01:11:37.030 --> 01:11:38.360
No, she would've said
something by now.

1134
01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:39.960
The person sitting
behind lan and Erin...

1135
01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.630
was wearing the exact same
charm bracelet...

1136
01:11:41.670 --> 01:11:43.400
our grandmother gave her.

1137
01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:45.430
Amber or Perry
were probably with her...

1138
01:11:45.470 --> 01:11:47.200
so they're next.

1139
01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:48.610
I gotta find Julie.

1140
01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:49.730
She went to
the tricentennial thing.

1141
01:11:49.780 --> 01:11:51.770
Well, l... I'm here now,
working security.

1142
01:11:51.810 --> 01:11:53.440
I'll start looking for her.

1143
01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:55.410
- I'm on my way.
- Wen, wait.

1144
01:11:55.450 --> 01:11:57.140
Look, after them, we're next.

1145
01:11:57.180 --> 01:11:59.450
So in case somethin'
happens to 'em...

1146
01:11:59.490 --> 01:12:01.150
before we meet up...

1147
01:12:01.190 --> 01:12:02.920
remember that time
we talked about?

1148
01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:04.650
When to look at our pictures?

1149
01:12:04.690 --> 01:12:06.420
It's now.

1150
01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.730
Great. Mine has no clue.

1151
01:12:17.770 --> 01:12:20.540
It's just me standing in front of
a blank background...

1152
01:12:20.570 --> 01:12:22.940
with Jason at
the amusement park.

1153
01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:25.950
Wait. McKinley.

1154
01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:29.070
Lan? Is he in the picture?

1155
01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:32.710
No, but it... it feels like a clue.

1156
01:12:33.990 --> 01:12:36.320
And yours is the picture
that I took...

1157
01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:38.090
when I flashed the camera
in your face.

1158
01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:42.080
It's all out of focus
and overexposed, like...

1159
01:12:47.670 --> 01:12:49.360
Like a firework
went off in my face?

1160
01:13:14.890 --> 01:13:18.090

1161
01:13:18.130 --> 01:13:21.260

The British are coming!

- Whoo!
- Yay!

1170
01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:51.790
Get 'em while they're hot!

1171
01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:58.660
Take it to those Redcoats!

1172
01:13:58.710 --> 01:14:01.000
Column, advance!

1173
01:14:13.050 --> 01:14:14.950
The kite is aloft.

1174
01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:19.220
Now, let us hope
for some lightning.

1175
01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:21.820
Fuck you, Ben Franklin.

1176
01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:33.270
But he kept insisting.
"Get over here," right?

1177
01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:37.570
This is awesome, dude!

1178
01:14:37.610 --> 01:14:38.870
Heh heh.

1179
01:14:38.910 --> 01:14:40.280
Whoa. Hey!

1180
01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:41.750
Ha ha! Come on!

1181
01:14:41.780 --> 01:14:43.770
Hey, get out of here with those, man!
You're gonna set these off!

1182
01:14:43.820 --> 01:14:45.280
Hurry, dude.

1183
01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:46.720
Come on, man, let's go!
Hurry up!

1184
01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:51.950
Ladies and gentlemen,
to celebrate McKinley's tricentennial...

1185
01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:54.720
the fireworks extravaganza
will begin shortly.

1186
01:14:59.870 --> 01:15:01.390
Oh, my God. Julie.

1187
01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:02.400
- What?
- Look.

1188
01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:04.340
There's Kahlil.

1189
01:15:04.370 --> 01:15:05.960
Should we?

1190
01:15:06.010 --> 01:15:07.670
Hey, guys. I'm sorry,
but you can't be here, OK?

1191
01:15:07.710 --> 01:15:10.010
The viewing site is over there.
You too, sir. Come on.

1192
01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:11.870
They're not gonna
make us move, are they?

1193
01:15:11.910 --> 01:15:13.500
I don't fucking believe them.

1194
01:15:13.550 --> 01:15:16.040
- OK, we gotta clear out.
- Mm-hm.

1195
01:15:22.620 --> 01:15:24.110
Excuse me.

1196
01:15:49.250 --> 01:15:50.770
- Ladies.
- Boys.

1197
01:15:50.820 --> 01:15:51.810
What's going on?

1198
01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:54.850
Hey, Julie.

1199
01:15:54.890 --> 01:15:57.320
- You three need to come with me.
- What did we do?

1200
01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:59.050
Look, it's for your own safety,
Julie, all right?

1201
01:15:59.090 --> 01:16:00.920
I'll tell you about it as soon as
we get away from here, OK?

1202
01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:02.790
Let go of me!

1203
01:16:02.830 --> 01:16:03.890
Julie.

1204
01:16:03.930 --> 01:16:05.120
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1205
01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:06.320
Julie!

1206
01:16:34.130 --> 01:16:35.150
Heh heh heh!

1207
01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:38.130
- Sweet.
- Ha ha!

1208
01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:42.390
Yeah!

1209
01:16:45.740 --> 01:16:47.000
Light it! Light it!
Go, go, go, man!

1210
01:16:52.750 --> 01:16:54.540
Julie!

1211
01:16:58.320 --> 01:16:59.810
Uh! Oh!

1212
01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:05.780
- Oh, shit!
- Dude, we gotta bail!

1213
01:17:20.270 --> 01:17:21.570
- Aah!
- Unh!

1214
01:17:21.610 --> 01:17:23.940
Unh! Hey!

1215
01:17:25.410 --> 01:17:28.610
Julie! No, wait, wait.

1216
01:17:28.650 --> 01:17:31.120
You're in danger, OK?
I'm trying to explain something.

1217
01:17:31.150 --> 01:17:33.880
Let me explain this to you.

1218
01:17:37.790 --> 01:17:39.220
Julie, look out!

1219
01:17:40.590 --> 01:17:42.390
- Aah!
- Unh!

1220
01:17:43.930 --> 01:17:45.730
Aah!

1221
01:17:45.770 --> 01:17:46.860
Julie!

1222
01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:49.390
Unh!

1223
01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:51.270
Aah! Unh!

1224
01:17:53.170 --> 01:17:54.700
Cut him off!

1225
01:17:59.610 --> 01:18:00.910
Unh!

1226
01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:03.470
Aah!

1227
01:18:06.750 --> 01:18:07.740
Aah!

1228
01:18:10.220 --> 01:18:11.620
Aah!

1229
01:18:19.130 --> 01:18:20.460
OK, OK.

1230
01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:24.200
Stay back! He's dangerous!

1231
01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:28.770
I got him.

1232
01:18:28.810 --> 01:18:31.000
- Just let me go.
- No, Julie.

1233
01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:32.240
You have to tell me,
you have to listen.

1234
01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:34.540
Tell me who was sitting next to you
on the roller coaster!

1235
01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:36.450
Oh, my God,
Julie, are you all right?

1236
01:18:38.150 --> 01:18:39.450
Listen to me!
You have to tell me...

1237
01:18:39.490 --> 01:18:41.350
who was sitting next to you
on the roller coaster!

1238
01:18:41.390 --> 01:18:43.790
Who? She's next!

1239
01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:50.060
Aah!

1240
01:19:02.410 --> 01:19:03.740
Kevin.

1241
01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:15.310
Aah!

1242
01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:17.020
Fire!

1243
01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:19.250
Kevin.

1244
01:19:19.290 --> 01:19:22.820
You saved my life.

1245
01:19:28.530 --> 01:19:29.930
Thanks for that, McKinley.

1246
01:19:29.970 --> 01:19:31.940
- Shut up, McKinley!
- No!

1247
01:19:31.970 --> 01:19:33.440
We have to get out of here now.

1248
01:19:33.470 --> 01:19:34.630
What's the deal?

1249
01:19:34.670 --> 01:19:37.270
Lan McKinley.
He causes my death.

1250
01:19:37.310 --> 01:19:39.440
In my picture I was wearing
the McKinley grad night shirt.

1251
01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:41.240
- He's the clue.
- What?

1252
01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:43.270
There's a first aid tent,
there should be security.

1253
01:19:45.450 --> 01:19:47.420
Get the fuck outta here, McKinley!

1254
01:19:47.450 --> 01:19:51.510
Hey, I'm just celebrating
our town's tricentennial.

1255
01:19:54.630 --> 01:19:55.690
You followed me!

1256
01:19:55.730 --> 01:19:57.630
Oh! You are paranoid.

1257
01:19:57.660 --> 01:19:59.720
But, hey, I saw what happened.

1258
01:19:59.770 --> 01:20:02.530
You're next, right?
You're the end of it, aren't you?

1259
01:20:02.570 --> 01:20:03.970
Man, I would be paranoid, too.

1260
01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:05.800
You didn't even believe me!

1261
01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:08.900
Yeah, well, seeing is believing.

1262
01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:10.640
Then you have
to stay away from me!

1263
01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:13.910
"Have to"?
Wow, that's extreme.

1264
01:20:18.620 --> 01:20:20.750
Oh, no way.

1265
01:20:22.420 --> 01:20:24.120
Do I cause your death?

1266
01:20:25.790 --> 01:20:27.730
Just like you caused Erin's?

1267
01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:30.750
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, what? What?

1268
01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:33.660
You have a vision? Was I in it?

1269
01:20:33.700 --> 01:20:35.600
Was I in a picture?

1270
01:20:37.870 --> 01:20:40.300
Just tell me how to start it off!

1271
01:20:40.340 --> 01:20:43.000
Let's get this over with!

1272
01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:45.770
You'll save me
if you just stay away!

1273
01:20:45.810 --> 01:20:47.110
Then it'll all be over!

1274
01:20:47.150 --> 01:20:50.120
What do I care? It skipped me.

1275
01:20:50.150 --> 01:20:51.950
For me, it is over.
I'm not dying.

1276
01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:54.850
I'm not dying!

1277
01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:07.060
Ha ha ha!

1278
01:21:07.100 --> 01:21:09.160
You see?

1279
01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:10.460
I'm not gonna die!

1280
01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:12.800

Yeah, but the air'll feel good.

1312
01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:28.920

Bruins, yeah!

Hey, man, peace out!

1319
01:24:56.220 --> 01:24:57.750
- Come on.
- Excuse me.

1320
01:24:57.790 --> 01:25:00.190
- Watch out!
- Hey, Bruins!

1321
01:25:00.230 --> 01:25:02.220
You missed the beginning.
Did you see that?

1322
01:25:02.260 --> 01:25:03.390
This is it!

1323
01:25:03.430 --> 01:25:07.060
Yo, comin' through. Excuse me.

1324
01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:11.040
Oh, my God.

1325
01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:15.800
I can't believe this. Here.

1326
01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:20.510
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

1327
01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:23.210
I thought you weren't
coming till tonight.

1328
01:25:23.250 --> 01:25:25.680
Well, Dad's car just, like,
dies out of nowhere...

1329
01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:27.520
and he couldn't get it fixed
anywhere on a holiday...

1330
01:25:27.550 --> 01:25:28.920
so instead of sitting around
for a few hours...

1331
01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:30.890
I lucked out and caught
an early train.

1332
01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:32.690
I hope I'm not messing you up or...

1333
01:25:32.730 --> 01:25:34.890
No, no, it's just, um...

1334
01:25:34.930 --> 01:25:38.660
I think I had a sense
that you were coming now.

1335
01:25:42.570 --> 01:25:45.000
I was just...

1336
01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:48.370
I was feeling like I did that night.

1337
01:25:49.380 --> 01:25:51.370
No. No, it's over.

1338
01:25:51.410 --> 01:25:54.280
You, me, Kevin went over
a thousand scenarios.

1339
01:25:54.310 --> 01:25:55.610
Lan was gonna cause your death...

1340
01:25:55.650 --> 01:25:57.450
you intervened,
and it skipped us.

1341
01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:06.850
Look, I'm not worried.

1342
01:26:06.890 --> 01:26:09.830
I ran into Kevin at home.
He's not worried.

1343
01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:11.130
And, if I were you...

1344
01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:13.530
until something happens
to me and then Kevin...

1345
01:26:13.570 --> 01:26:15.190
you've got nothing
to worry about.

1346
01:26:16.540 --> 01:26:18.370
You're right.

1347
01:26:18.410 --> 01:26:20.240
Uhh.

1348
01:26:20.270 --> 01:26:22.430
Hey, l... I want you to meet
my roommate and my friend, OK?

1349
01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:23.570
Yeah.

1350
01:26:25.510 --> 01:26:26.910
Hey, guys. This is Julie, my...

1351
01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:40.890
What are you doing here?

1352
01:26:40.930 --> 01:26:43.120
Wendy! Julie!

1353
01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:45.060
What are the chances?

1354
01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:46.460
How long have you been
on this train?

1355
01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:48.090
Uh, since home.

1356
01:26:48.130 --> 01:26:49.970
I was headin' up
to check out the game.

1357
01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:51.560
I was gonna look you up
afterwards.

1358
01:26:54.170 --> 01:26:55.400
You OK?

1359
01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:57.210
Is something wrong?

1360
01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:06.810
Aah!

1361
01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:19.830
Aah!

1362
01:27:26.070 --> 01:27:27.330
Aah!

1363
01:27:29.910 --> 01:27:32.610
- Aah!
- Unh!

1364
01:27:35.150 --> 01:27:37.140
- Julie, stay down!
- Aah!

1365
01:27:37.180 --> 01:27:39.410
Julie!

1366
01:27:39.450 --> 01:27:40.440
Aah!

1367
01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:47.060
- Kevin!
- Unh!

1368
01:27:48.660 --> 01:27:49.750
Aaaaaah!

1369
01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:52.600
Oh, God!

1370
01:27:52.630 --> 01:27:53.760
Aah!

1371
01:27:54.770 --> 01:27:57.170
Aah!

1372
01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:45.980
Aah! Unh!

1373
01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:08.100
No!

1374
01:29:08.140 --> 01:29:11.440
I was gonna look you up
afterwards, but...

1375
01:29:12.850 --> 01:29:13.900
You OK?

1376
01:29:13.950 --> 01:29:16.440
Is somethin' wrong?

1377
01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:19.710
The train...

1378
01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:22.780
Oh, shit. Not again.

1379
01:29:22.820 --> 01:29:24.410
