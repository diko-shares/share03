26
00:02:48.213 --> 00:02:49.716
Oh, man! Heh heh.

27
00:02:50.967 --> 00:02:52.218
- Did you see that?
- Woo!

28
00:02:55.556 --> 00:02:57.183
Oh, my God. Ha ha!

29
00:02:57.224 --> 00:02:59.227
- Yes! Yes!
- Nice, nice, nice.

30
00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:00.604
- Aw, sick!
- Worth the wait.

31
00:03:00.646 --> 00:03:01.647
Oh, babe. You missed out.

32
00:03:01.688 --> 00:03:02.690
Yes!

33
00:03:02.732 --> 00:03:05.109
I want to get off.

34
00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:18.542
Whoo! Ow!

35
00:03:18.584 --> 00:03:19.753
Ha ha ha!

36
00:03:19.795 --> 00:03:21.088
That was intense, man.

37
00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:23.382
To feel how that would be to just crash and burn like that.

38
00:03:23.423 --> 00:03:23.982
Yeah, yeah.

39
00:03:24.008 --> 00:03:26.218
Maybe for you, but our lives are actually goin' somewhere.

40
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.388
Oh! OK, well, where we gotta go is to the roller coaster.

41
00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.223
'Cause our pass is for 9:15.

42
00:03:30.265 --> 00:03:31.641
If we miss that, we'll stand in line...

43
00:03:31.683 --> 00:03:32.894
for, like, a day and a half, and that's gonna kill me.

44
00:03:32.935 --> 00:03:33.895
- OK!
- All right?

45
00:03:33.978 --> 00:03:34.937
So let's go.

46
00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:37.441
They're totally gonna dig this, man!

47
00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:40.152
OK. Come on, it won't kill us to get a deep-fried Snickers and a Coke.

48
00:03:40.194 --> 00:03:41.469
Before ridin' Devil's Flight?

49
00:03:41.495 --> 00:03:42.656
Yeah, that might kill me.

50
00:03:42.691 --> 00:03:45.784
No! What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, man.

51
00:03:45.826 --> 00:03:47.035
Ha ha ha!

52
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.266
- Unh!
- Ha ha!

53
00:04:04.307 --> 00:04:05.599
Oh, I'll take that.

54
00:04:05.641 --> 00:04:06.299
No. Come on, gimme.

55
00:04:06.325 --> 00:04:07.268
It's not even mine, Kevin.

56
00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.645
It's the yearbook's.
Just... Kevin.

57
00:04:08.687 --> 00:04:09.646
Ha ha!

58
00:04:09.688 --> 00:04:11.315
- Oh!
- Oh, got it.

59
00:04:11.356 --> 00:04:12.915
Oh, my God, you're such an idiot.

60
00:04:12.941 --> 00:04:14.152
Hey. Hey. Gimme the...

61
00:04:14.194 --> 00:04:16.071
Ha ha!

62
00:04:16.112 --> 00:04:17.323
- Ow!
- Nice.

63
00:04:17.365 --> 00:04:20.034
Um, could you, like, please delete that one of Stacy?

64
00:04:20.076 --> 00:04:21.453
Ha ha!

65
00:04:21.495 --> 00:04:23.330
These are for the yearbook.

66
00:04:23.372 --> 00:04:25.499
And I have to turn them in tomorrow to make a deadline...

67
00:04:25.541 --> 00:04:28.544
and, like, I doubt it if a shot of Stacy Kobayashi's camel toe...

68
00:04:28.586 --> 00:04:29.755
is gonna make it in there.

69
00:04:29.796 --> 00:04:30.881
Whew. I'd buy two.

70
00:04:30.923 --> 00:04:32.174
Ha ha ha!

71
00:04:32.216 --> 00:04:33.593
Number 38, your order's ready.

72
00:04:33.635 --> 00:04:35.678
That's us.

73
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.180
I am so sorry.

74
00:04:37.222 --> 00:04:38.766
Kevin can get so out of control.

75
00:04:38.808 --> 00:04:41.692
Let me just say he would make me crazy.

76
00:04:41.727 --> 00:04:44.148
Ha! I mean, you know I'm such a control freak...

77
00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:46.942
like I couldn't handle that.

78
00:04:50.613 --> 00:04:51.865
I'm breaking up with him.

79
00:04:51.907 --> 00:04:53.318
Couple of weeks.

80
00:04:53.344 --> 00:04:54.993
After graduation.

81
00:04:55.035 --> 00:04:56.371
I've been wanting to for a while.

82
00:04:56.412 --> 00:04:58.998
But don't tell anybody, OK?

83
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.334
Whoa. Ha ha!

84
00:05:00.376 --> 00:05:01.510
Now, that shot there?

85
00:05:01.536 --> 00:05:03.154
That'll sell some yearbooks.

86
00:05:04.131 --> 00:05:05.674
- I love it.
- I love it.

87
00:05:05.716 --> 00:05:10.054
Oh!
 Oh, all right, so I'm a total whore.

88
00:05:10.095 --> 00:05:11.555
Come on, go, go, go, go, go, go go!

89
00:05:11.597 --> 00:05:13.049
Oh, my God, Ashley, you're winning.

90
00:05:13.075 --> 00:05:14.017
You're totally winning.

91
00:05:14.059 --> 00:05:14.710
Am I winning?

92
00:05:14.736 --> 00:05:16.061
Yeah, come on, hurry!

93
00:05:16.103 --> 00:05:17.981
OK, come on, come on, come on, come on!

94
00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.566
Am I winning?

95
00:05:19.592 --> 00:05:20.608
Look around, I don't want to look.

96
00:05:20.643 --> 00:05:21.861
You're totally winning.

97
00:05:21.902 --> 00:05:22.945
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!

98
00:05:22.987 --> 00:05:25.364
- Don't look!
- Oh, my God! Come on!

99
00:05:25.406 --> 00:05:26.071
Oh, my God!

100
00:05:26.097 --> 00:05:27.725
I'm winning! I'm winning!

101
00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:30.579
Aah! Aah!

102
00:05:30.621 --> 00:05:32.665
- I won!
- I knew you would.

103
00:05:32.706 --> 00:05:35.335
Oh, my God! Gimme my prize.

104
00:05:35.377 --> 00:05:35.700
Good job.

105
00:05:35.726 --> 00:05:36.920
That was so awesome, Ashley.

106
00:05:36.962 --> 00:05:38.005
Ashley.

107
00:05:41.134 --> 00:05:43.052
Woo! Ha ha!

108
00:05:43.094 --> 00:05:44.688
How ya doin', my brother?

109
00:05:44.714 --> 00:05:46.624
You havin' a good time, huh?

110
00:05:48.226 --> 00:05:50.269
- You like that?
- Ha ha!

111
00:05:50.311 --> 00:05:51.516
Yeah! You like it.

112
00:05:51.542 --> 00:05:53.190
Give it up. Give it up.

113
00:05:53.232 --> 00:05:55.109
Whoo-ooh!

114
00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:56.403
Sam!

115
00:06:01.993 --> 00:06:03.494
Excuse me.

116
00:06:05.623 --> 00:06:06.957
You're not a senior.

117
00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:08.375
And what are you gonna do about it...

118
00:06:08.416 --> 00:06:11.629
Miss "Cutest Couple," Rah Rah? Ha ha!

119
00:06:11.671 --> 00:06:13.423
Mom know you're here?

120
00:06:14.967 --> 00:06:17.136
You are a complete bitch if you tell her.

121
00:06:17.177 --> 00:06:19.139
Proof where you were.

122
00:06:19.181 --> 00:06:20.807
Take a shot of this.

123
00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:22.059
Ha ha ha!

124
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:30.270
Yeah! That's what I'm talking about.

125
00:06:30.296 --> 00:06:30.694
That's three.

126
00:06:30.735 --> 00:06:32.613
# That is three, number three #

127
00:06:32.655 --> 00:06:35.534
# Oh, I'm the man, I'm the man #
Man, I am hot.

128
00:06:35.576 --> 00:06:36.208
Man, gimme some right here, man.

129
00:06:36.234 --> 00:06:36.744
Right here! Right here!

130
00:06:36.785 --> 00:06:37.598
What you doin'?

131
00:06:37.624 --> 00:06:38.954
Get the fuck back. Hoo!

132
00:06:38.996 --> 00:06:40.329
My God, I am good.

133
00:06:40.355 --> 00:06:41.291
Here we go.

134
00:06:41.333 --> 00:06:43.710
Boy, I'll tell ya...

135
00:06:43.745 --> 00:06:45.505

3 for 3. It's all mine.

139
00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:51.678
Here we go. Here we go.

140
00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:52.482
Big prize.
Watch out.

141
00:06:52.508 --> 00:06:52.847
Come on.

142
00:06:52.888 --> 00:06:53.931
Unh!

143
00:06:56.809 --> 00:06:58.479
Ho ho ho!

144
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.397
# That's what I'm talkin' 'bout #

145
00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:01.259
We gonna get that one.

146
00:07:01.285 --> 00:07:02.192
You want that blue one?

147
00:07:02.233 --> 00:07:03.234
That's the one we gonna get.

148
00:07:05.737 --> 00:07:08.366
Ha ha ha!

149
00:07:10.827 --> 00:07:15.666
Ha ha ha ha!

150
00:07:15.708 --> 00:07:21.131
You can run, but you cannot hide.

151
00:07:21.173 --> 00:07:23.133
- Yes!
- Whoo! Here we are, baby.

152
00:07:23.176 --> 00:07:24.219
- Yes!
- Whoo!

153
00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.263
- There it is.
- Awesome.

154
00:07:26.304 --> 00:07:28.182
Here, get a pic of this. Ahhh!

155
00:07:28.224 --> 00:07:30.976
This is the beginning of the end.

156
00:07:32.061 --> 00:07:34.063
Ha ha ha!

157
00:07:34.105 --> 00:07:36.275
Hey, guys, get in line.

158
00:07:40.948 --> 00:07:43.116
Let's go on again!

159
00:07:43.158 --> 00:07:44.201
What's wrong?

160
00:07:45.787 --> 00:07:47.664
I'm...

161
00:07:47.706 --> 00:07:49.876
I was having that feeling like dejá vu, you know?

162
00:07:49.917 --> 00:07:53.211
Except for something that hasn't happened yet.

163
00:07:53.253 --> 00:07:54.297
Hey, J.

164
00:07:54.338 --> 00:07:55.590
Come on, man, let's go.

165
00:07:55.632 --> 00:07:57.592
- Yeah, yeah, hold on.
- Come on.

166
00:07:57.634 --> 00:07:59.136
What, are you weirded out by the ride?

167
00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:02.395
'Cause, look, I know you.

168
00:08:02.421 --> 00:08:03.976
And I think that maybe...

169
00:08:04.017 --> 00:08:05.602
you're nervous about this roller coaster...

170
00:08:05.644 --> 00:08:08.273
because they say the real fear with these rides...

171
00:08:08.314 --> 00:08:11.611
comes from the feeling of having no control.

172
00:08:11.651 --> 00:08:14.780
Everyone imagines weird stuff when they get scared.

173
00:08:14.821 --> 00:08:17.450
But it never turns out to be what they imagine.

174
00:08:17.492 --> 00:08:18.993
Never.

175
00:08:20.287 --> 00:08:21.455
OK.

176
00:08:21.497 --> 00:08:25.210
You can run, but you cannot hide.

177
00:08:25.252 --> 00:08:27.963
Oh! Where you guys are right now if you raise your hands and just...

178
00:08:28.005 --> 00:08:29.966
Ha... cup them slightly...

179
00:08:30.008 --> 00:08:32.384
it'll look you're holding the devil's balls.

180
00:08:32.426 --> 00:08:34.262
And we'd wanna do that why?

181
00:08:34.304 --> 00:08:36.640
When else you ever gonna see a dick that big?

182
00:08:36.681 --> 00:08:37.934
I'm lookin' at one right now.

183
00:08:37.975 --> 00:08:42.481
Ha ha!
Man, you guys are smokin' hot.

184
00:08:42.523 --> 00:08:43.288
Get out, Frankie.

185
00:08:43.314 --> 00:08:44.817
Yeah, why are you even here?

186
00:08:44.859 --> 00:08:46.653
Yeah, you graduated, like, two years ago.

187
00:08:46.695 --> 00:08:49.031
I stuck around to monitor your development.

188
00:08:49.072 --> 00:08:49.958
Yeah. Good to go.

189
00:08:49.984 --> 00:08:50.950
Good to go, baby.

190
00:08:50.992 --> 00:08:52.130
Let's do it. Let's do it.

191
00:08:52.156 --> 00:08:52.993
Come on. Come on.

192
00:08:53.035 --> 00:08:57.207
You may never return from Devil's Flight.

193
00:08:57.248 --> 00:08:58.458
Ha ha ha ha!

194
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.628
You're totally sad.

195
00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:06.302
Try not to scream!

196
00:09:06.343 --> 00:09:09.264
Ha ha ha!

197
00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:14.728
That was totally awesome!

198
00:09:14.763 --> 00:09:16.063
Yeah! Sweet!

199
00:09:40.635 --> 00:09:42.012
You all right?

200
00:09:42.053 --> 00:09:44.348
There's nothing to worry about.

201
00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:46.559
A roller coaster is just elemental physics.

202
00:09:46.601 --> 00:09:49.647
A conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy.

203
00:09:49.688 --> 00:09:51.816
Yeah. Odds are like one in 250 million...

204
00:09:51.858 --> 00:09:53.193
of dying in a roller coaster.

205
00:09:53.235 --> 00:09:55.570
Yeah, yeah, thanks for that, McKinley.

206
00:09:55.612 --> 00:09:57.906
You're more likely to die driving to an amusement park...

207
00:09:57.948 --> 00:09:59.909
than dying at one.

208
00:10:01.703 --> 00:10:03.705
Whoo! Heh.

209
00:10:10.297 --> 00:10:11.674
Here we go.

210
00:10:14.344 --> 00:10:16.220
Whoo!

211
00:10:18.473 --> 00:10:20.058
You like this?

212
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.687
Won it on the Wacky Ladder.

213
00:10:22.729 --> 00:10:26.317
You know that ladder deal that wobbles?
Took it.

214
00:10:26.358 --> 00:10:27.497
I like this.

215
00:10:27.523 --> 00:10:29.111
It's old school.

216
00:10:29.153 --> 00:10:32.157
Frankie Cheeks is old school, ladies.

217
00:10:32.199 --> 00:10:33.310
What's that?

218
00:10:33.336 --> 00:10:35.995
Oh, well, it'd be my honor.

219
00:10:36.036 --> 00:10:37.037
Ew.

220
00:10:37.079 --> 00:10:38.851
Oh! Let's go.

221
00:10:38.886 --> 00:10:40.625
Hey... Baby.

222
00:10:40.667 --> 00:10:42.627
- How many?
- Uh, 4.

223
00:10:42.669 --> 00:10:43.963
- 4.
- Yeah.

224
00:10:44.005 --> 00:10:45.340
Uh, gate one.

225
00:10:45.381 --> 00:10:46.633
- Yeah. Front car.
- Yes!

226
00:10:46.674 --> 00:10:47.802
Wait... No. No, please.

227
00:10:47.843 --> 00:10:49.085
I'm sorry, I don't wanna be a hassle.

228
00:10:49.111 --> 00:10:50.262
I just... I can't sit in the front.

229
00:10:50.304 --> 00:10:52.474
I cannot see the tracks. '
I'll freak.

230
00:10:52.516 --> 00:10:55.018
OK. Take it easy.

231
00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:58.147
Uh, well, Carrie will sit in the back with you.
Right, babe?

232
00:10:58.188 --> 00:10:59.045
Uh! Why me?

233
00:10:59.071 --> 00:11:01.151
What?
'Cause we're girls?

234
00:11:01.193 --> 00:11:01.802
Fuck that.

235
00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:04.237
I'm going to Berkeley and I won't get to do this for a while.

236
00:11:04.279 --> 00:11:05.490
I'm sitting in the front.

237
00:11:06.491 --> 00:11:07.951
J, just go, OK?
I'll live.

238
00:11:08.034 --> 00:11:09.453
You're not gonna sit by yourself.

239
00:11:09.495 --> 00:11:10.261
All right, you know what?

240
00:11:10.287 --> 00:11:11.455
We'll just settle this like real men.

241
00:11:11.497 --> 00:11:12.360
How about that?

242
00:11:12.386 --> 00:11:13.190
Hmm? Call it.

243
00:11:13.374 --> 00:11:14.209
Heads.

244
00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:17.837
Shit! Damn it.

245
00:11:18.839 --> 00:11:20.110
All right, fine, what the fuck.

246
00:11:20.136 --> 00:11:21.258
It's the same ride, right?

247
00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.094
Go. Go ahead. Bye, babe.

248
00:11:23.136 --> 00:11:25.639
Hey, uh, just do me a favor.

249
00:11:25.722 --> 00:11:26.564
Keep an eye on her, OK?

250
00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:27.517
She's kinda freaked out.

251
00:11:27.558 --> 00:11:28.685
- Oh. Cool.
- All right?

252
00:11:28.726 --> 00:11:29.840
Yeah. Boom, buddy.

253
00:11:29.866 --> 00:11:30.670
No problem.

254
00:11:35.569 --> 00:11:36.611
Ha ha ha!

255
00:11:41.408 --> 00:11:44.204
Aaah!

256
00:11:54.675 --> 00:11:56.635
Ohh!

257
00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:06.731
Here we go. Hey!

258
00:12:06.773 --> 00:12:08.942
J! Keep your hands to yourself, man.

259
00:12:08.984 --> 00:12:09.582
I'm serious.

260
00:12:09.608 --> 00:12:11.279
You know, payback's a bitch, OK?

261
00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.114
You know, she might need some comforting...

262
00:12:13.156 --> 00:12:14.742
..and I'll be there for her.
OK?

263
00:12:14.783 --> 00:12:15.671
Hey, no! No.

264
00:12:15.697 --> 00:12:17.077
Get out. Get out.

265
00:12:17.119 --> 00:12:18.495
Hey! Find another cockpit, Top Gun.

266
00:12:18.536 --> 00:12:20.247
No. Get...

267
00:12:20.289 --> 00:12:22.291
Let's just get in the back, OK?

268
00:12:24.002 --> 00:12:25.504
Ha ha ha!

269
00:12:25.546 --> 00:12:27.631
Ahem.

270
00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:31.678
Guess who's back?

271
00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.264
- Ugh.
- Ugh.

272
00:12:33.306 --> 00:12:35.725
Hey!

273
00:12:35.767 --> 00:12:37.728
I'll meet you at the end.

274
00:12:39.646 --> 00:12:41.106
Here! All right!

275
00:12:41.148 --> 00:12:42.274
Cool!

276
00:12:43.484 --> 00:12:45.779
Hey. How'd you guys get in here?

277
00:12:45.821 --> 00:12:47.573
What? I'm 55 inches.

278
00:12:47.614 --> 00:12:49.074
- Sure. Come on out.
- Oh, man.

279
00:12:49.116 --> 00:12:50.410
You, too. Out.

280
00:12:50.452 --> 00:12:51.619
- Ready?
- Ohh!

281
00:12:51.661 --> 00:12:54.081
I told you we wouldn't get away with it.

282
00:12:54.123 --> 00:12:55.124
You OK?

283
00:12:55.166 --> 00:12:56.709
Let's go on the bumper cars.

284
00:12:56.751 --> 00:12:58.670
Come on. Here we go.

285
00:13:02.048 --> 00:13:03.300
Yeah!

286
00:13:08.181 --> 00:13:08.807
What's up, man?

287
00:13:08.833 --> 00:13:09.249
I'm good.

288
00:13:12.937 --> 00:13:15.566
Dare you to, uh, flash me them sweet, sweet titties...

289
00:13:15.608 --> 00:13:16.817
when we go through the loop.

290
00:13:22.115 --> 00:13:24.117
All right. Ha ha!

291
00:13:28.915 --> 00:13:31.627
Yo! What, you can't read?

292
00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:36.841
Oh. Well, can I just put it in my pocket, man?

293
00:13:36.883 --> 00:13:37.927
- Is that cool?
- Yeah.

294
00:13:37.968 --> 00:13:39.971
Yeah? Cool.
Thanks, buddy. Sorry.

295
00:13:48.606 --> 00:13:50.149
Oh!

296
00:13:50.232 --> 00:13:52.027
Aw, shit!

297
00:13:55.531 --> 00:13:56.616
Here you go!

298
00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:07.295
Whoo-ooh!

299
00:14:07.336 --> 00:14:09.036
Whoo! Win, baby!

300
00:14:09.062 --> 00:14:10.866
Yes, baby! Win!

301
00:14:10.925 --> 00:14:12.719
Come on!

302
00:14:12.761 --> 00:14:14.554
Come on. Get hyped.

303
00:14:14.596 --> 00:14:15.889
The first hill's so high.

304
00:14:15.931 --> 00:14:17.350
Yeah.

305
00:14:17.392 --> 00:14:20.228
This is what we need!

306
00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:23.106
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

307
00:14:23.148 --> 00:14:24.399
Whoo!

308
00:14:24.441 --> 00:14:26.903
Whoo-hoo!

309
00:14:26.944 --> 00:14:29.030
- Let's do this!
- Just win!

310
00:14:29.071 --> 00:14:30.032
Ow!

311
00:14:32.451 --> 00:14:33.912
Whoo!

312
00:14:35.288 --> 00:14:36.957
Aw, yeah!

313
00:15:00.153 --> 00:15:01.571
Whoo!

314
00:15:07.786 --> 00:15:09.455
Whoo! Shit!

315
00:15:17.172 --> 00:15:18.758
Aah!

316
00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.594
Oh, man.

317
00:15:20.635 --> 00:15:22.555
Oh, my God!

318
00:15:22.597 --> 00:15:23.597
Here we go!

319
00:15:23.638 --> 00:15:25.307
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

320
00:15:25.349 --> 00:15:26.643
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

321
00:15:26.678 --> 00:15:28.019
Aah!

322
00:15:28.061 --> 00:15:30.105
Yeah! Whoo!

323
00:15:35.487 --> 00:15:38.657
Aah!

324
00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.829
- Aah!
- Aah!

325
00:15:44.539 --> 00:15:46.500
Ha ha!

326
00:15:49.295 --> 00:15:50.838
Aah! Aah! Ha ha ha!

327
00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:52.842
Whoo!

328
00:15:53.968 --> 00:15:55.886
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

329
00:15:55.928 --> 00:15:58.348
Ha ha ha! Whoo!

330
00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:00.642
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

331
00:16:04.147 --> 00:16:06.107
Aah! Aah!

332
00:16:11.864 --> 00:16:14.702
Whoo!

333
00:16:19.249 --> 00:16:22.002
Yeah! Show me your titties!

334
00:16:22.044 --> 00:16:23.171
- Fuck off, Frankie!
- Oh!

335
00:16:32.515 --> 00:16:33.808
Aah!

336
00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:36.186
- Aah!
- Aah! Aah!

337
00:16:37.771 --> 00:16:39.690
Aah!

338
00:16:42.945 --> 00:16:44.238
Unh!

339
00:16:46.615 --> 00:16:48.033
Oh, shit!

340
00:16:48.075 --> 00:16:49.703
- Aah!
- Aah!

341
00:16:49.744 --> 00:16:51.079
Aah!

342
00:16:52.122 --> 00:16:53.216
Oh, my God!

343
00:16:53.242 --> 00:16:55.501
We're gonna fall off!

344
00:16:55.543 --> 00:16:57.045
Aah!

345
00:17:00.341 --> 00:17:01.760
No!

346
00:17:12.105 --> 00:17:13.773
- Aah!
- Aaah!

347
00:17:17.487 --> 00:17:18.946
Aah!

348
00:17:20.783 --> 00:17:21.867
Aah!

349
00:17:23.453 --> 00:17:24.704
Oh! Oh!

350
00:17:30.168 --> 00:17:31.837
Aah!

351
00:17:34.507 --> 00:17:35.800
Unh!

352
00:17:36.802 --> 00:17:38.763
Oh!

353
00:17:38.805 --> 00:17:40.306
- Yow!
- Kevin!

354
00:17:41.308 --> 00:17:42.476
No!

355
00:17:42.518 --> 00:17:43.852
Aah!

356
00:17:51.028 --> 00:17:52.195
Whoa!

357
00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:54.532
Aah!

358
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:58.245
No! Aah!

359
00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:10.808
Aah!

360
00:18:10.843 --> 00:18:12.679
Erin, hang on!

361
00:18:12.721 --> 00:18:15.098
Erin!

362
00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:15.585
Hang on!

363
00:18:15.612 --> 00:18:16.643
Don't let go!

364
00:18:16.684 --> 00:18:17.644
I can't.

365
00:18:17.685 --> 00:18:21.440
Aah!

366
00:18:21.482 --> 00:18:22.984
No!

367
00:18:24.151 --> 00:18:25.154
Aah!

368
00:18:25.195 --> 00:18:26.947
Oh, God!

369
00:18:26.989 --> 00:18:28.532
Hang on, Wen.

370
00:18:28.573 --> 00:18:31.493
Hang on! Help me rock it!

371
00:18:36.583 --> 00:18:38.127
Unh! Unh! Unh!

372
00:18:40.004 --> 00:18:41.715
Unh!

373
00:18:42.883 --> 00:18:45.386
Almost got it!
Gently.

374
00:18:55.273 --> 00:18:57.067
Aaaah!

375
00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:01.739
No!

376
00:19:01.781 --> 00:19:04.368
Unh! Aah!

377
00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:07.371
Aah!

378
00:19:10.041 --> 00:19:11.751
Yo. What, you can't read?

379
00:19:11.793 --> 00:19:12.469
Oh, well. I'll just...

380
00:19:12.495 --> 00:19:13.420
I'll put it in my pocket, OK?

381
00:19:13.462 --> 00:19:14.546
Yeah.

382
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:16.131
Thanks, bro.

383
00:19:16.173 --> 00:19:16.701
Ahh. All right.

384
00:19:16.727 --> 00:19:17.509
Let's do this, Wen...

385
00:19:17.551 --> 00:19:19.428
What're you...?

386
00:19:19.469 --> 00:19:21.055
Here you go!

387
00:19:21.097 --> 00:19:23.308
Yeah! Let's do it, baby!
Whoo!

388
00:19:23.349 --> 00:19:25.394
We have to get off of here.

389
00:19:25.436 --> 00:19:26.559
No, don't push the button!

390
00:19:26.585 --> 00:19:27.897
Don't! Don't push the button!

391
00:19:27.938 --> 00:19:30.608
Unh! Let me off!
 Let me off!

392
00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:31.238
Wen, Wen!
It's all right.

393
00:19:31.264 --> 00:19:31.943
Jesus, it's gonna be over...

394
00:19:31.984 --> 00:19:32.904
No! It's gonna crash!

395
00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:33.736
It's gonna crash!

396
00:19:33.778 --> 00:19:34.738
Wendy?

397
00:19:34.822 --> 00:19:36.468
The hydraulics will rupture!

398
00:19:36.494 --> 00:19:38.410
The tracks'll collapse! Please!

399
00:19:38.451 --> 00:19:39.159
What's going on?

400
00:19:39.185 --> 00:19:39.911
Let me off!

401
00:19:39.953 --> 00:19:41.246
Chick's on somethin'.

402
00:19:41.288 --> 00:19:42.330
It's all right!
You'll be OK!

403
00:19:42.372 --> 00:19:43.416
OK, let 'em out.
Just the back.

404
00:19:43.458 --> 00:19:44.709
Wen. Hey!
Wendy!

405
00:19:46.753 --> 00:19:47.963
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

406
00:19:48.005 --> 00:19:50.174
Relax. Now, what's the matter?

407
00:19:50.216 --> 00:19:52.635
I saw it. I saw it in my head.

408
00:19:52.677 --> 00:19:53.658
The tracks collapsed.

409
00:19:53.684 --> 00:19:55.012
The roller coaster crashed.

410
00:19:55.054 --> 00:19:56.807
No, she was just a little upset before.

411
00:19:56.849 --> 00:19:58.892
Man, please, can you please control that bitch?

412
00:19:58.934 --> 00:20:00.391
Damn. "It's gonna crash!

413
00:20:00.417 --> 00:20:02.272
The hydraulics, the coaster!"

414
00:20:02.314 --> 00:20:04.274
Man, she's just trying to get some fuckin' attention.

415
00:20:04.358 --> 00:20:04.828
You know what?

416
00:20:04.854 --> 00:20:06.069
You're a real piece
of shit, Lewis.

417
00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:07.570
- Fuck you.
- Fuck moi?

418
00:20:07.612 --> 00:20:08.989
No, man, fuck you!
Don't touch me.

419
00:20:09.031 --> 00:20:09.990
Ow!

420
00:20:10.032 --> 00:20:10.991
Hey, hey!

421
00:20:11.033 --> 00:20:12.242
Unh!

422
00:20:12.283 --> 00:20:13.244
Just relax!

423
00:20:13.285 --> 00:20:14.578
Fight, man!

424
00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:15.663
Hey. Hey. Let me out.

425
00:20:15.705 --> 00:20:17.290
Nobody else gets off this ride!

426
00:20:17.373 --> 00:20:19.293
Dude, let me off.

427
00:20:19.334 --> 00:20:20.627
So high school.

428
00:20:20.669 --> 00:20:21.796
Let's out.

429
00:20:21.838 --> 00:20:22.839
- Calm down!
- Get off of him!

430
00:20:22.881 --> 00:20:23.923
- Relax!
- Ian!

431
00:20:23.965 --> 00:20:25.556
Where you ladies going?

432
00:20:25.582 --> 00:20:26.803
There's a fight.

433
00:20:26.844 --> 00:20:28.474
Get him out of here!

434
00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:30.432
Hey! Calm down! Relax!

435
00:20:30.474 --> 00:20:31.322
Dude, let me off.

436
00:20:31.348 --> 00:20:32.767
I gotta make sure she's OK.

437
00:20:32.809 --> 00:20:33.663
Relax! Calm down!

438
00:20:33.689 --> 00:20:35.020
# Hey! Ho! Let's go #

439
00:20:35.062 --> 00:20:35.890
Get your big ass off me, man!

440
00:20:35.916 --> 00:20:36.689
# Hey, ho, let's go! #

441
00:20:36.731 --> 00:20:39.151
- Let me out!
- # Hey, ho, let's go! #

442
00:20:39.192 --> 00:20:40.444
Dude!

443
00:20:40.485 --> 00:20:43.363
# Hey, ho, let's go, hey, ho, let's go #

444
00:20:43.405 --> 00:20:45.116
- Here we go!
- Let me off!

445
00:20:45.158 --> 00:20:46.534
# Hey, ho #

446
00:20:49.205 --> 00:20:50.581
Dude, that's my girlfriend!

447
00:20:50.623 --> 00:20:51.624
Oh, my God!

448
00:20:51.666 --> 00:20:53.042
Whoo!

449
00:20:53.084 --> 00:20:55.044
Stop it! No! Stop it!

450
00:20:56.212 --> 00:20:57.158
Stop it! Please!

451
00:20:57.184 --> 00:20:59.049
Please, the tracks are broken.

452
00:20:59.091 --> 00:21:02.054
Stop! Stop! Please!

453
00:21:02.095 --> 00:21:03.639
Jason!

454
00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:05.600
Hey, just relax, OK?

455
00:21:05.642 --> 00:21:07.977
- Please!
- Ease up, man. She's all right.

456
00:21:08.019 --> 00:21:09.145
OK? Just let her settle down.

457
00:21:09.187 --> 00:21:10.648
She can settle down at home!
Now listen...

458
00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:12.275
what is your home phone number?

459
00:21:12.316 --> 00:21:13.754
OK, we're gonna call your mother.

460
00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:15.278
Everything will be taken care of...

461
00:21:15.319 --> 00:21:17.322
Aah!

462
00:21:18.616 --> 00:21:23.538
Oh, my God! Jason!

463
00:22:17.812 --> 00:22:19.523
Ohh.

464
00:22:58.028 --> 00:22:59.739
Hey, Wendy!

465
00:22:59.781 --> 00:23:01.498
Hey!

466
00:23:01.533 --> 00:23:04.245
Wait! Wendy!

467
00:23:04.287 --> 00:23:05.872
Hey! Hey, Wen. Wait.

468
00:23:05.913 --> 00:23:07.624
I need... I need to talk to you about something.

469
00:23:07.666 --> 00:23:09.460
Just here to pick up my diploma.

470
00:23:09.501 --> 00:23:10.753
You're not going to graduation?

471
00:23:10.794 --> 00:23:12.088
No.

472
00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:15.885
Look, you're not the only one in a fucked up place, OK?

473
00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:18.553
God, I mean, I just thought maybe...

474
00:23:18.595 --> 00:23:20.640
it'd be good for you to be somewhere where other people feel the same way.

475
00:23:20.682 --> 00:23:21.683
At graduation?

476
00:23:21.724 --> 00:23:23.435
No. Thanks.
I've had enough funerals.

477
00:23:23.476 --> 00:23:24.860
Then do it for J and Carrie.

478
00:23:24.895 --> 00:23:26.731
Do what? If you die, then there's nothing...

479
00:23:26.772 --> 00:23:29.109
then you're just dead, and they don't know.

480
00:23:29.151 --> 00:23:30.402
And if they are up in Heaven with Lincoln and Gandhi...

481
00:23:30.444 --> 00:23:32.905
do you think they really care about our high school graduation?
No.

482
00:23:32.946 --> 00:23:35.408
I am alive, and I don't care.

483
00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:36.743
As soon as I pull out of that parking lot...

484
00:23:36.785 --> 00:23:39.079
I am so out of McKinley.

485
00:23:39.121 --> 00:23:40.497
Without J, what's here for me?

486
00:23:40.539 --> 00:23:42.542
I'm here. OK?

487
00:23:42.584 --> 00:23:46.004
I made a promise to J that I would take care of you.

488
00:23:46.045 --> 00:23:48.883
On the ride.
For 3 minutes.

489
00:23:48.924 --> 00:23:50.928
You weren't making the promise for a lifetime.

490
00:23:50.969 --> 00:23:53.013
Kevin...

491
00:23:53.055 --> 00:23:54.681
if it wasn't for you and J being friends...

492
00:23:54.723 --> 00:23:56.914
and me and Carrie being friends...

493
00:23:56.949 --> 00:23:59.103
we wouldn't have even hung out.

494
00:24:01.273 --> 00:24:03.985
We don't even like each other.

495
00:24:12.663 --> 00:24:15.082
"Ian McKinley. "

496
00:24:15.123 --> 00:24:17.544
How pathetic is it that my last name...

497
00:24:17.585 --> 00:24:19.259
is the same as my high school?

498
00:24:19.294 --> 00:24:22.132
Julie, look who I got to sign my yearbook.

499
00:24:22.173 --> 00:24:24.885
- No way. Nice.
- Yeah.

500
00:24:32.812 --> 00:24:34.815
I think we should invite her.

501
00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:36.316
- You think?
- Yeah.

502
00:24:40.446 --> 00:24:42.288
Wen? Um...

503
00:24:42.323 --> 00:24:44.910
So we're ready for graduation tonight...

504
00:24:44.951 --> 00:24:47.330
we're going to the tanning salon after this...

505
00:24:47.371 --> 00:24:49.832
and we are so totally cool if you wanna come with.

506
00:24:49.867 --> 00:24:50.959
Totally.

507
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.087
And just like, talk if you want.

508
00:24:54.296 --> 00:24:56.640
Here's my cell.

509
00:24:56.675 --> 00:24:58.969
I already have your number.

510
00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:03.223
That was so nice of us.

511
00:25:13.111 --> 00:25:14.572
You're not alone.

512
00:25:14.613 --> 00:25:16.448
God, I appreciate everyone trying to help.

513
00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:17.701
OK? I really do.

514
00:25:17.742 --> 00:25:19.494
No, it's happened before.

515
00:25:19.536 --> 00:25:22.539
OK? I went online looking for an explanation about...

516
00:25:22.581 --> 00:25:24.840
Wendy, just... just listen to me, all right?

517
00:25:24.875 --> 00:25:27.921
All right, look, I went online looking for an explanation...

518
00:25:27.962 --> 00:25:29.381
about what happened, and I found out...

519
00:25:29.422 --> 00:25:31.968
about this high school French class from New York.

520
00:25:32.009 --> 00:25:35.014
Six years ago they went on a trip to Paris.

521
00:25:35.055 --> 00:25:36.348
When they were boarding...

522
00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:38.809
a kid had a vision that the plane was gonna explode.

523
00:25:38.851 --> 00:25:41.896
Just like you did.

524
00:25:41.937 --> 00:25:43.522
He freaked out...

525
00:25:43.564 --> 00:25:45.943
and seven people got off the plane.

526
00:25:48.446 --> 00:25:49.864
Just like us.

527
00:25:51.908 --> 00:25:55.580
And on takeoff, Flight 180 blew up.

528
00:25:55.621 --> 00:25:57.958
And over the next several months...

529
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.171
everyone who got off that plane started dying in weird accidents.

530
00:26:02.213 --> 00:26:05.676
They died in the order they would've if they had stayed on the plane.

531
00:26:05.717 --> 00:26:09.096
Unless someone intervened, then it skipped them.

532
00:26:09.137 --> 00:26:11.724
Fuck you, Kevin.

533
00:26:11.766 --> 00:26:14.645
W- Wendy! Wendy! Hey!

534
00:26:38.633 --> 00:26:41.470
Ohh, every time we come here.

535
00:26:41.512 --> 00:26:44.765
I was thinking of going for 20 minutes in the Muller.

536
00:26:44.807 --> 00:26:47.518
We did that for all the funerals and it turned out amazing.

537
00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:48.979
Yeah, but that was just a couple of weeks ago, though.

538
00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:50.605
I mean, we're still pretty bronzed.

539
00:26:50.647 --> 00:26:52.482
I was just thinking we could go for, like, a tune-up.

540
00:26:52.524 --> 00:26:54.944
I just wanna make sure that we look our best.

541
00:26:54.986 --> 00:26:56.237
Yeah.

542
00:26:56.279 --> 00:26:58.282
You know, for all those kids that died that night...

543
00:26:58.324 --> 00:27:00.284
who will never get a graduation.

544
00:27:02.079 --> 00:27:02.646
You know what?

545
00:27:02.672 --> 00:27:03.579
You're totally right.

546
00:27:03.621 --> 00:27:05.915
- I'm sorry.
- Mmm.

547
00:27:29.278 --> 00:27:31.822
This is my...
my good guy luck bracelet...

548
00:27:31.864 --> 00:27:34.117
that Grandma left me in her will.

549
00:27:35.452 --> 00:27:36.453
Ohh!

550
00:27:36.495 --> 00:27:38.539
Julie?

551
00:27:40.375 --> 00:27:42.253
I need...

552
00:27:45.506 --> 00:27:47.341
I could use some help.

553
00:27:48.926 --> 00:27:50.449
I have such...

554
00:27:50.475 --> 00:27:53.057
such guilt over Jason.

555
00:27:53.098 --> 00:27:56.144
I should never have let that ride go.

556
00:27:56.186 --> 00:27:59.691
God. I'm usually such a control freak...

557
00:27:59.732 --> 00:28:01.192
but I didn't do enough to stop it.

558
00:28:01.234 --> 00:28:04.696
I should've done everything I could to stop it.

559
00:28:05.738 --> 00:28:08.534
And I would give anything...

560
00:28:08.576 --> 00:28:10.703
to have a second chance.

561
00:28:13.499 --> 00:28:15.167
But I never can.

562
00:28:19.798 --> 00:28:22.593
I don't want to some day feel that way about you, Julie.

563
00:28:22.628 --> 00:28:25.930
I mean, I can't talk to Mom and Dad.

564
00:28:27.932 --> 00:28:29.852
You're all I have left.

565
00:28:31.938 --> 00:28:33.357
You think when I find a place...

566
00:28:33.398 --> 00:28:35.609
maybe you could come stay with me for a while?

567
00:28:37.779 --> 00:28:39.906
You know I will.

568
00:28:41.951 --> 00:28:43.619
You...

569
00:28:45.662 --> 00:28:47.165
keep this now...

570
00:28:47.206 --> 00:28:49.709
and I'll get it when I come see you.

571
00:28:51.378 --> 00:28:54.715
Oh. And... hey, how 'bout on your end?

572
00:28:54.757 --> 00:28:57.928
Can I use the school camera for graduation tonight?

573
00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:00.807
Yeah. As long as you bring it back to school on Monday.

574
00:29:00.842 --> 00:29:02.309
Done.

575
00:29:03.351 --> 00:29:04.478
Oh. Um...

576
00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:05.945
Actually, the battery is pretty low...

577
00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:09.317
so why don't you go get ready, and I'll recharge it a bit.

578
00:29:09.352 --> 00:29:10.902
Cool.

579
00:29:26.172 --> 00:29:27.297
In a hurry, Yuri.

580
00:29:27.339 --> 00:29:27.859
Sorry, sorry.

581
00:29:27.885 --> 00:29:29.299
Cell phone signal is shit in here.

582
00:29:29.341 --> 00:29:31.344
I think tanning beds mess with signal.

583
00:29:31.379 --> 00:29:32.810
I must go outside.

584
00:29:32.845 --> 00:29:35.641
Why don't you just use that phone?

585
00:29:35.683 --> 00:29:38.645
I would, but she talks forever, then my boss gives me shit.

586
00:29:40.397 --> 00:29:41.815
Shit. That's her.

587
00:29:41.857 --> 00:29:43.776
Ohh!

588
00:29:43.818 --> 00:29:44.903
You know what? Just go outside.

589
00:29:44.944 --> 00:29:46.279
We can deal with this ourselves.

590
00:29:46.321 --> 00:29:47.822
OK.

591
00:29:49.741 --> 00:29:53.830
Hey. No drinks in the room this time, OK?

592
00:29:53.871 --> 00:29:54.914
Good.

593
00:30:07.013 --> 00:30:08.138
What are you doing?

594
00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:10.684
Nobody is walking in here and seein' me naked.

595
00:31:48.178 --> 00:31:50.223
Oh, my God.

596
00:32:00.443 --> 00:32:01.444
Dude, he said no drinks.

597
00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:02.571
If you spill that shit...

598
00:32:02.606 --> 00:32:04.699
we're gonna have to clean it up like last time.

599
00:32:04.734 --> 00:32:06.827
Mmm!

600
00:32:06.868 --> 00:32:07.991
Happy, beyotch?

601
00:32:08.017 --> 00:32:09.438
Nothing to spill.

602
00:32:11.373 --> 00:32:13.626
Why does Yuri keep it so cold in here?

603
00:32:14.043 --> 00:32:16.505
Maybe it's supposed to be colder for the machines or whatever.

604
00:32:16.546 --> 00:32:18.632
Oh, a few degrees won't hurt.

605
00:32:43.955 --> 00:32:45.958
Shit! I forgot my iPod.

606
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.002
Sucks, bitch.

607
00:32:48.043 --> 00:32:50.213
They got CDs.

608
00:32:53.591 --> 00:32:55.636
Ew. Celine?

609
00:32:55.677 --> 00:32:57.061
Britney?

610
00:32:57.096 --> 00:32:59.307
Dude, are we like the only cool people that come here or what?

611
00:32:59.349 --> 00:33:02.234
Uh, yeah.

612
00:33:02.269 --> 00:33:05.023
Ugh. Whatever.

613
00:33:19.206 --> 00:33:22.377
Why are you wearing underwear?

614
00:33:22.419 --> 00:33:24.630
Steinmetz says he gets off on tan lines.

615
00:33:24.672 --> 00:33:27.175
All right.

616
00:34:11.103 --> 00:34:12.648
# Roller coaster #

617
00:34:12.689 --> 00:34:13.982
# Of love #

618
00:34:14.024 --> 00:34:15.323
# Say what? #

619
00:34:15.358 --> 00:34:17.486
# Roller coaster #

620
00:34:17.528 --> 00:34:19.134

00:34:20.781 --> 00:34:21.783
# Right #

623
00:34:21.825 --> 00:34:23.410
# Of love #

624
00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:25.997
# Roller coaster #

625
00:34:26.039 --> 00:34:28.124
# Ooh ooh ooh #

626
00:34:28.166 --> 00:34:31.963
# Roller coaster of love #

627
00:34:32.004 --> 00:34:33.673
# Roller coaster #

628
00:34:33.714 --> 00:34:35.049
# Wow wow wow #

629
00:34:35.084 --> 00:34:36.384
# Ooh ooh ooh #

630
00:34:36.426 --> 00:34:39.889
# Roller coaster of love... #

631
00:35:01.123 --> 00:35:03.083
# I #

632
00:35:04.084 --> 00:35:05.086
# Huh, huh #

633
00:35:08.924 --> 00:35:10.760
# I'm gonna ride, girl #

634
00:35:10.802 --> 00:35:12.262
# Yeah #

635
00:35:12.303 --> 00:35:13.889
# Whoo-hoo-hoo #

636
00:35:13.931 --> 00:35:15.516
# Wow, yeah #

637
00:35:15.558 --> 00:35:16.641
# Huh huh #

638
00:35:18.144 --> 00:35:19.270
# Ow #

639
00:35:19.312 --> 00:35:21.105
# Oh, oh #

640
00:35:25.694 --> 00:35:27.405
Whoo.

641
00:35:27.447 --> 00:35:30.450
# Roller coaster of love #

642
00:35:30.492 --> 00:35:31.744
# Love roller coaster, girl #

643
00:35:31.786 --> 00:35:33.538
# Roller coaster #

644
00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:36.459
# Lovin' you in a freaky world, child #

645
00:35:36.494 --> 00:35:39.462
# Roller coaster of love #

646
00:35:46.762 --> 00:35:49.105
Camera charged?

647
00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:52.060
Oh, um, sorry, the battery's totally dead.

648
00:35:52.102 --> 00:35:53.938
Camera's not working. Sorry.

649
00:35:57.193 --> 00:36:00.403
Look, Julie, I need a minute, OK?

650
00:36:00.445 --> 00:36:02.448
Like private.

651
00:36:07.037 --> 00:36:09.958
# That feels nice,
roller coaster #

652
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.252
# One more time #

653
00:36:12.294 --> 00:36:15.715
# Roller coaster of love #

654
00:36:16.799 --> 00:36:18.550
# Roller coaster #

655
00:36:19.636 --> 00:36:24.141
# Roller coaster of love #

656
00:36:26.852 --> 00:36:28.814
Ugh.

657
00:36:28.856 --> 00:36:31.358
It's way too warm in here now, huh?

658
00:36:36.574 --> 00:36:37.485
I fucked up.

659
00:36:37.511 --> 00:36:39.534
I set it too hot in here.

660
00:36:39.576 --> 00:36:41.120
Huh?

661
00:36:54.596 --> 00:36:56.014
Ow! Aah!

662
00:36:58.768 --> 00:36:59.893
Hello?

663
00:36:59.935 --> 00:37:01.355
Hey, Ashley, it's Wendy...

664
00:37:01.381 --> 00:37:02.964
Psych! Leave a message.

665
00:37:04.399 --> 00:37:05.692
Hi, Ashley, this is Wendy.

666
00:37:05.733 --> 00:37:06.735
Gimme a call whenever you guys are done.

667
00:37:06.777 --> 00:37:07.737
Aah!

668
00:37:07.778 --> 00:37:09.655
And thanks again for the invite.

669
00:37:09.697 --> 00:37:11.742
- Someone help!
- Aah!

670
00:37:13.744 --> 00:37:15.705
Sorry I was too late.

671
00:37:21.294 --> 00:37:23.463
Aah!

672
00:37:23.505 --> 00:37:25.091
Aah! Aah!

673
00:37:25.133 --> 00:37:27.635
Aah! Aah! Aah!

674
00:37:30.639 --> 00:37:32.934
Aah! Aah! Aah!

675
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:37.065
Aah! Aah!

676
00:37:37.106 --> 00:37:38.942
Oh! Oh!

677
00:37:38.983 --> 00:37:40.442
Oh! Aah!

678
00:37:41.611 --> 00:37:42.571
Aaah! Aaah!

679
00:37:46.617 --> 00:37:47.744
Hey, open the door!

680
00:37:56.463 --> 00:37:58.716
Help me!

681
00:38:01.135 --> 00:38:13.150
Aah!

682
00:38:14.819 --> 00:38:19.199
We may feel that our lives are not our own.

683
00:38:19.241 --> 00:38:23.245
That Death controls, frames our lives.

684
00:38:23.287 --> 00:38:26.631
Our birth's nothing but death begun.

685
00:38:26.666 --> 00:38:31.297
Yet, whether it is with this tragic loss of young lives...

686
00:38:31.339 --> 00:38:34.718
which we have suffered much of late...

687
00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:39.683
or with the soft passing of the elderly in the night...

688
00:38:39.718 --> 00:38:44.313
we are all equal in Death's eyes.

689
00:38:44.354 --> 00:38:47.032
"Equal in Death's eyes?"

690
00:38:47.067 --> 00:38:47.674
All of us?

691
00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:49.069
How can you say that?

692
00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:50.320
Shut up, McKinley.

693
00:38:50.362 --> 00:38:51.500
Dude, think it through.

694
00:38:51.526 --> 00:38:53.032
Charlie Manson made it to 70.

695
00:38:53.074 --> 00:38:55.118
- Osama? Still kickin'.
- Let's go.

696
00:38:55.159 --> 00:38:57.830
Pimps, vice-presidents walking around.

697
00:38:57.871 --> 00:38:59.466
All the atrocities they've committed...

698
00:38:59.492 --> 00:39:00.584
Let's just go. Come on.

699
00:39:00.625 --> 00:39:01.877
they're alive and well.

700
00:39:01.918 --> 00:39:06.006
These two girls, who'd never done shit to anybody...

701
00:39:06.048 --> 00:39:08.217
- Shh!
- they don't get to make it to 18?

702
00:39:08.259 --> 00:39:09.886
Where's the fucking equality in that?

703
00:39:11.221 --> 00:39:12.555
- What?
- Come on, man.

704
00:39:12.591 --> 00:39:13.891
I can... Yeah. Fine.

705
00:39:13.933 --> 00:39:15.560
Fine. All right. All right.

706
00:39:15.601 --> 00:39:17.396
I'm fine. All right.

707
00:39:17.431 --> 00:39:19.189
That's crazy.

708
00:39:20.649 --> 00:39:23.944
Those of you who would like to pay a final remembrance...

709
00:39:23.986 --> 00:39:27.157
please step forward at this time.

710
00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:36.877
I so feel this is so my fault.

711
00:39:36.919 --> 00:39:39.381
How could it possibly be your fault?

712
00:39:39.423 --> 00:39:42.509
Seein' women as nothin' but fun bags.

713
00:39:42.551 --> 00:39:46.555
I mean... if I'd've seen their...

714
00:39:46.597 --> 00:39:49.393
whatever... humanity...

715
00:39:49.434 --> 00:39:52.480
they wouldn't have felt the pressure to look so good.

716
00:39:52.522 --> 00:39:54.687
Impress Franklin Cheeks.

717
00:39:54.713 --> 00:39:56.944
Go on diets. Deodorize.

718
00:39:56.979 --> 00:40:00.323
Stretch. Tan.

719
00:40:01.366 --> 00:40:02.951
Don't be down, Frankie.

720
00:40:02.993 --> 00:40:04.787
Be proud of your ability to make everything...

721
00:40:04.822 --> 00:40:07.081
that happens somehow a story about you.

722
00:40:11.878 --> 00:40:13.213
God!

723
00:40:23.435 --> 00:40:26.020
Yo, man.
These things really suck, man.

724
00:40:26.062 --> 00:40:28.273
Fucking boring.

725
00:40:28.315 --> 00:40:31.152
Hey, if you ever have to come to my funeral...

726
00:40:31.194 --> 00:40:32.946
man, bring me a PSP or somethin'.

727
00:40:32.988 --> 00:40:34.614
'Least I have somethin' to do then.

728
00:40:38.494 --> 00:40:41.457
Whew.

729
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.169
Hello?

730
00:40:44.211 --> 00:40:45.795
I'm with J.

731
00:41:12.202 --> 00:41:15.081
What are you doing up here in the nosebleeds?

732
00:41:16.583 --> 00:41:19.191
You know, I could've gotten you second row.

733
00:41:19.226 --> 00:41:21.798
I didn't want to upset anyone by being there.

734
00:41:21.839 --> 00:41:26.011
And I wondered if maybe here I could feel J's...

735
00:41:27.513 --> 00:41:29.974
spirit or presence or...

736
00:41:30.016 --> 00:41:32.019
whatever.

737
00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:34.855
But now that I'm here...

738
00:41:34.897 --> 00:41:38.485
if there's any place that makes me feel like there's no life after death...

739
00:41:40.153 --> 00:41:42.115
it's a cemetery.

740
00:41:44.033 --> 00:41:46.995
Yeah, I haven't felt Carrie's spirit either.

741
00:41:48.037 --> 00:41:49.749
And I've tried.

742
00:41:50.791 --> 00:41:52.752
Real hard. Heh.

743
00:41:55.464 --> 00:41:58.551
I thought maybe he's been with me since...

744
00:42:00.553 --> 00:42:01.831
that night...

745
00:42:01.857 --> 00:42:04.684
before I got on the ride...

746
00:42:04.725 --> 00:42:06.603
Jason said...

747
00:42:06.645 --> 00:42:08.229
God, and it was just to get me on the ride...

748
00:42:08.271 --> 00:42:10.071
he said...

749
00:42:10.106 --> 00:42:14.695
"Your fear is from a sense of having no control. "

750
00:42:14.737 --> 00:42:17.407
And I've felt that fear since the moment he said it.

751
00:42:17.449 --> 00:42:21.413
Even thought it maybe somehow caused the hallucination...

752
00:42:21.454 --> 00:42:26.043
but this fear is more than just being scared.

753
00:42:26.085 --> 00:42:28.629
It's like a presence.

754
00:42:28.671 --> 00:42:32.592
Like a living thing always with me.

755
00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:35.763
You think it's J?

756
00:42:35.805 --> 00:42:37.307
No, I know it's not.

757
00:42:37.349 --> 00:42:42.230
This presence is the opposite of how J made me feel.

758
00:42:42.272 --> 00:42:46.569
It's cold and terrifying.

759
00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:24.866
That's the last photograph Lincoln posed for.

760
00:43:24.907 --> 00:43:26.409
The photographic plate was broken...

761
00:43:26.451 --> 00:43:28.828
causing a line that can't be removed.

762
00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:30.705
Exactly where he was shot.

763
00:43:32.874 --> 00:43:34.710
Look. See the shadow?

764
00:43:36.337 --> 00:43:38.966
But what do these pictures have to do with us?

765
00:43:39.008 --> 00:43:42.352
Look. This occurred one year to the day...

766
00:43:42.387 --> 00:43:43.491
of the Flight 180 disaster.

767
00:43:43.517 --> 00:43:44.473
Look at the road sign.

768
00:43:44.514 --> 00:43:46.516
Look, I guess you came to me with this...

769
00:43:46.558 --> 00:43:48.895
because I'm responsible for putting this in your head...

770
00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:50.146
with the Flight 180 thing.

771
00:43:50.188 --> 00:43:52.190
And it did happen, and it may be occurring here...

772
00:43:52.232 --> 00:43:54.025
but you can't believe every weird thing out there...

773
00:43:54.067 --> 00:43:55.193
because you're desperate for an answer.

774
00:43:55.235 --> 00:43:57.113
I took these.

775
00:43:57.154 --> 00:43:59.115
That night.

776
00:44:06.041 --> 00:44:07.876
These?

777
00:44:11.588 --> 00:44:12.715
Are these it?

778
00:44:17.722 --> 00:44:20.224
Oh, shit.

779
00:44:21.810 --> 00:44:23.729
Oh... shit.

780
00:44:25.314 --> 00:44:26.858
Ohh.

781
00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:29.903
Whoa, whoa, hey.

782
00:44:29.929 --> 00:44:30.947
You all right?

783
00:44:30.988 --> 00:44:32.614
I'm feeling a little woozy.

784
00:44:34.283 --> 00:44:36.244
When was the last time you ate?

785
00:44:37.454 --> 00:44:39.081
I don't remember.

786
00:44:40.249 --> 00:44:41.918
All right, come on.
 I'll drive.

787
00:44:46.298 --> 00:44:50.011
OK, those kids on Flight 180 died in accidents...

788
00:44:50.053 --> 00:44:52.389
in the order they would've died if they'd have stayed on the plane.

789
00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:55.058
OK?
So if this is that, then...

790
00:44:56.269 --> 00:44:58.396
then Frankie was behind Ashlyn and Ashley.

791
00:44:59.647 --> 00:45:00.983
When I saw Ashley and Ashlyn's picture...

792
00:45:01.018 --> 00:45:03.027
I felt this instinct.

793
00:45:03.069 --> 00:45:04.779
Like there was a hint in the picture. I even...

794
00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:07.324
I even called to see if I could keep them from going.

795
00:45:07.359 --> 00:45:08.575
Well, what's Frankie's picture look like?

796
00:45:08.617 --> 00:45:09.619
It's right here.

797
00:45:09.661 --> 00:45:11.997
- You got it?
- Yeah.

798
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.501
- Wait! Watch out!
- Oh!

799
00:45:16.543 --> 00:45:18.630
Hey! Hey! Are you crazy?

800
00:45:18.671 --> 00:45:20.673
Sorry!

801
00:45:23.177 --> 00:45:24.720
All right, let's just eat over there.

802
00:45:24.755 --> 00:45:26.263
And go through the drive through.

803
00:45:26.305 --> 00:45:27.474
I don't want anyone hearing what we're talking about.

804
00:45:27.516 --> 00:45:29.226
Well, it's nice to see that things haven't made you...

805
00:45:29.268 --> 00:45:30.644
any less of a control freak.

806
00:45:39.112 --> 00:45:39.654
You got it?

807
00:45:39.681 --> 00:45:40.740
Yeah, all right.

808
00:45:40.782 --> 00:45:41.824
Here's Frank's picture.

809
00:45:41.866 --> 00:45:43.368
All right.

810
00:45:43.409 --> 00:45:44.456
Well, this is obvious.

811
00:45:44.482 --> 00:45:45.788
He's falling off a ladder.

812
00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:47.269
A rope ladder, though.

813
00:45:47.295 --> 00:45:48.734
Maybe he might hang.

814
00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:51.456
Look, or maybe it's not that literal.

815
00:45:51.482 --> 00:45:52.421
All right, what's...

816
00:45:52.462 --> 00:45:53.672
Could there be anything in these prizes?

817
00:45:53.714 --> 00:45:56.425
Oh, what, like he's gonna get crushed by a giant Spongebob?

818
00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:59.804
Hey, Spongebob lives underwater.

819
00:46:01.223 --> 00:46:03.768
It's so sad that you know that.

820
00:46:03.810 --> 00:46:05.854
All right. He won that tacky mud-flap girl chain...

821
00:46:05.896 --> 00:46:07.439
on this game, though, so...

822
00:46:07.481 --> 00:46:09.442
aren't those usually on those big 18 wheelers?

823
00:46:09.483 --> 00:46:10.736
Yeah. Yeah.

824
00:46:10.777 --> 00:46:12.654
God, I don't see it in this picture anywhere though.

825
00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:16.909
All right! God.

826
00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:21.414
All right.

827
00:46:25.128 --> 00:46:26.295
Uh, can I take your order?

828
00:46:26.337 --> 00:46:28.173
Yeah. What do you want?

829
00:46:33.263 --> 00:46:34.681
Are you OK?

830
00:46:42.816 --> 00:46:45.444
Please tell me there's a short in your wiring.

831
00:46:47.905 --> 00:46:48.561
Whoa. Whoa.

832
00:46:48.587 --> 00:46:50.826
That guy's way too close to my truck.

833
00:46:50.868 --> 00:46:52.953
Hey, you're too fucking close, man! Pull up!

834
00:46:52.995 --> 00:46:54.581
Hey!

835
00:46:58.794 --> 00:47:00.420
# There is someone #

836
00:47:00.462 --> 00:47:01.964
Stop! Stop!

837
00:47:02.005 --> 00:47:03.007
# Walking behind you #

838
00:47:04.008 --> 00:47:05.677
Watch out! Shit!

839
00:47:05.719 --> 00:47:06.846
- What the fuck?
- # Turn around #

840
00:47:06.887 --> 00:47:08.973
- Oh, my God!
- # Look at me #

841
00:47:09.015 --> 00:47:10.058
Get out! Get out!

842
00:47:10.084 --> 00:47:11.101
What? What?

843
00:47:11.143 --> 00:47:12.770
Behind us!

844
00:47:12.811 --> 00:47:14.021
There's no one in that truck!

845
00:47:14.056 --> 00:47:15.196
# Watching your footsteps #

846
00:47:15.231 --> 00:47:16.953
Shit! Hey! Pull up, man!

847
00:47:16.979 --> 00:47:18.342
Come on! Pull up!

848
00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:22.990
- # Look at me #
- Unh! Shit!

849
00:47:23.031 --> 00:47:23.991
- # There is someone #
- Back up!

850
00:47:24.032 --> 00:47:25.076
Back up!

851
00:47:26.119 --> 00:47:28.121
# Who really loves you #

852
00:47:29.624 --> 00:47:31.792
# Here's my heart #

853
00:47:31.834 --> 00:47:32.249
Watch your eyes!

854
00:47:32.275 --> 00:47:33.003
Watch your eyes! Come here!

855
00:47:33.045 --> 00:47:35.255
# In my hand #

856
00:47:35.297 --> 00:47:39.009
# Turn around #

857
00:47:39.051 --> 00:47:40.386
- # Look at me #
- Come on. Let's go!

858
00:47:40.428 --> 00:47:41.722
Come on, come on, come on.

859
00:47:47.562 --> 00:47:48.938
Unh!

860
00:48:26.568 --> 00:48:27.903
- Oh!
- Unh!

861
00:48:37.248 --> 00:48:39.004
We're all done here.

862
00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:40.585
You need a ride?

863
00:48:40.626 --> 00:48:43.095
Um, we can walk to my house...

864
00:48:43.130 --> 00:48:45.507
and then I'll give you a ride to yours.

865
00:48:46.885 --> 00:48:48.136
No, thanks.
We'll be OK.

866
00:48:53.142 --> 00:48:54.227
Will we?

867
00:48:56.647 --> 00:48:58.107
Yeah. We'll be all right.

868
00:48:58.149 --> 00:49:00.651
I mean...

869
00:49:00.693 --> 00:49:02.778
how Frank...

870
00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:04.615
God, it... it's not only horrible...

871
00:49:04.656 --> 00:49:05.823
but can you feel...

872
00:49:05.849 --> 00:49:07.910
can you feel how vicious it was?

873
00:49:07.952 --> 00:49:09.287
Easy.

874
00:49:09.329 --> 00:49:11.289
OK? Easy.

875
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.585
Let's just...

876
00:49:14.627 --> 00:49:16.462
let's just take a step back.

877
00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:20.133
All right? He was behind Ashley and Ashlyn on the ride...

878
00:49:20.175 --> 00:49:21.200
but there was no ladder here.

879
00:49:21.226 --> 00:49:22.261
You know, there was no rope.

880
00:49:22.303 --> 00:49:24.805
Nothing in that picture pointed to this.

881
00:49:24.847 --> 00:49:26.642
We were wrong about the photos.

882
00:49:26.683 --> 00:49:27.983
I should've left town.

883
00:49:28.009 --> 00:49:29.520
It's better not knowing.

884
00:49:29.561 --> 00:49:32.566
No, it's never better staying ignorant.

885
00:49:32.607 --> 00:49:34.652
Willful ignorance is surrendering control.

886
00:49:35.695 --> 00:49:39.491
What, did you read that somewhere in Mrs. Brooks' English class?

887
00:49:41.201 --> 00:49:43.370
No. I... you know, I'm not...

888
00:49:43.412 --> 00:49:45.790
I'm not the total idiot you think I am.

889
00:49:46.999 --> 00:49:49.336
OK, that's Lewis after Frank...

890
00:49:49.378 --> 00:49:51.422
then Ian and Erin.

891
00:49:51.463 --> 00:49:53.591
There's a couple of kids behind them, but I can't make them out...

892
00:49:53.633 --> 00:49:55.268
because this guy's arm's in the way.

893
00:49:55.294 --> 00:49:55.677
Can you?

894
00:49:55.719 --> 00:49:56.721
No.

895
00:49:56.762 --> 00:49:58.639
All right, you know what?

896
00:49:58.681 --> 00:50:01.100
We'll ask Lewis, Ian, and Erin if they remember.

897
00:50:01.142 --> 00:50:02.685
OK?

898
00:50:02.727 --> 00:50:05.272
Are there any more pictures from the roller coaster?

899
00:50:18.581 --> 00:50:21.291
I guess...

900
00:50:21.333 --> 00:50:22.877
that kind of thing is gonna happen to us

901
00:50:22.919 --> 00:50:24.128
for the rest of our lives.

902
00:50:24.170 --> 00:50:25.755
Yeah.

903
00:50:27.258 --> 00:50:29.552
You know, I was gonna...

904
00:50:29.593 --> 00:50:31.722
I was gonna ask her to marry me.

905
00:50:33.307 --> 00:50:35.267
Right after graduation.

906
00:50:35.309 --> 00:50:37.103
Heh.

907
00:50:49.201 --> 00:50:50.661
Oh.

908
00:50:56.752 --> 00:50:58.713
No, wait.

909
00:50:58.755 --> 00:51:00.173
Look, behind Stacy.

910
00:51:01.174 --> 00:51:02.384
That's Frank.

911
00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:05.095
This picture shows how he died.

912
00:51:10.143 --> 00:51:12.521
All right, go back to Lewis.

913
00:51:14.523 --> 00:51:15.949
OK, he's got that hammer.

914
00:51:15.984 --> 00:51:18.862
And the weight looks like it's coming down...

915
00:51:18.904 --> 00:51:20.698
on his head.

916
00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:21.741
No, no, no, check this out.

917
00:51:21.783 --> 00:51:24.869
Right now Lewis is down at State for football training camp.

918
00:51:24.911 --> 00:51:27.330
State's team is called the Sultans.

919
00:51:27.365 --> 00:51:28.958
That's it. That's the clue.

920
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.306
We have to tell him.

921
00:51:30.332 --> 00:51:32.029
Show him these pictures.

922
00:51:36.258 --> 00:51:37.260
Wouldn't you want to know?

923
00:51:38.845 --> 00:51:40.222
Wait, there's pictures of us in there?

924
00:51:40.263 --> 00:51:41.975
Yeah.

925
00:51:42.016 --> 00:51:43.267
Yeah, of course.

926
00:51:43.308 --> 00:51:45.270
Huh. No.

927
00:51:45.353 --> 00:51:48.106
No. I don't want to see mine.
No. Huh.

928
00:51:48.148 --> 00:51:49.442
What about willful ignorance?

929
00:51:49.483 --> 00:51:52.153
Well, I'm full of shit, all right?!

930
00:51:52.195 --> 00:51:53.864
I mean, I never thought I could see my own death...

931
00:51:53.906 --> 00:51:55.157
before it happened, Wendy.

932
00:51:56.367 --> 00:51:57.218
No, you know what?

933
00:51:57.244 --> 00:51:58.495
We can tell Lewis, but...

934
00:51:58.537 --> 00:52:01.540
Seriously, if there's any way to beat this thing...

935
00:52:01.575 --> 00:52:03.167
I gotta stay focused...

936
00:52:03.209 --> 00:52:04.751
and if I look at that picture, all I'm gonna do is obsess.

937
00:52:04.793 --> 00:52:05.767
So, you know what?

938
00:52:05.793 --> 00:52:07.363
No, I don't want to see it.

939
00:52:09.466 --> 00:52:11.636
I mean, unless we have to.

940
00:52:12.637 --> 00:52:15.348
You mean until we have to.

941
00:52:21.356 --> 00:52:22.983
One more thing.

942
00:52:23.024 --> 00:52:24.985
Is it bad?

943
00:52:25.027 --> 00:52:28.280
I mean, is it, like, painful or embarrassing?

944
00:52:28.573 --> 00:52:30.825
I mean, there's nothing, like, up my ass or anything, right?

945
00:52:30.867 --> 00:52:32.452
I'll see you tomorrow.

946
00:52:37.376 --> 00:52:39.002
You on crack. Both of you.

947
00:52:39.044 --> 00:52:39.839
Just listen, OK?

948
00:52:39.865 --> 00:52:41.380
Ashley and Ashlyn were first.

949
00:52:41.422 --> 00:52:42.551
Then Frankie Cheeks and then you.

950
00:52:42.577 --> 00:52:43.049
This is the...

951
00:52:43.091 --> 00:52:44.593
- Aw, come on, Kevin.
- Listen.

952
00:52:44.634 --> 00:52:46.136
McKinley and Erin were next, all right?

953
00:52:46.178 --> 00:52:47.402
And there were two people in front of us.

954
00:52:47.428 --> 00:52:48.305
Do you remember who they were?

955
00:52:48.347 --> 00:52:49.248
Fuck no, and I don't care.

956
00:52:49.274 --> 00:52:50.600
And you shouldn't care either, man...

957
00:52:50.642 --> 00:52:52.936
'cause what you're tellin' me right now is straight bullshit.

958
00:52:52.977 --> 00:52:54.062
Just listen, Lewis.

959
00:52:54.104 --> 00:52:56.440
Kevin, it's like those stories.

960
00:52:56.482 --> 00:53:00.320
Like this guy was killed by a car he sold 10 years ago.

961
00:53:00.362 --> 00:53:03.658
Two sisters, right, were killed when they were driving to visit each other.

962
00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:05.826
You know, shit like that, man.

963
00:53:05.868 --> 00:53:07.328
Fuck the Bruins!

964
00:53:07.369 --> 00:53:09.581
Oh, yeah! Fuck the Bruins!

965
00:53:09.623 --> 00:53:11.416
Bruin faggots!

966
00:53:11.458 --> 00:53:13.044
Yeah! Fuck the Bruins!

967
00:53:16.047 --> 00:53:19.385
Man, you're reading into this shit like them damn urban legends.

968
00:53:19.427 --> 00:53:21.388
Three people have died, Lewis.

969
00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:22.764
I mean, if you think this can be written off...

970
00:53:22.806 --> 00:53:24.767
as a simple coincidence and it ends there...

971
00:53:24.808 --> 00:53:26.602
you're in serious denial.

972
00:53:26.644 --> 00:53:28.145
Unh! What about you two, huh?

973
00:53:28.187 --> 00:53:29.439
What?

974
00:53:29.481 --> 00:53:32.609
You both lost people real close to you in a fucked-up way.

975
00:53:32.651 --> 00:53:34.612
And in order to feel less guilty or whatever...

976
00:53:34.654 --> 00:53:36.364
seeing signs and patterns, man.

977
00:53:36.406 --> 00:53:38.054
I don't blame you.

978
00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:40.161
But it's wrong, dawg.

979
00:53:40.202 --> 00:53:42.706
Unh! It's wrong.

980
00:53:44.166 --> 00:53:45.959
That's denial.

981
00:53:46.001 --> 00:53:47.795
Unh!

982
00:53:48.837 --> 00:53:51.174
- Unh!
- You got it!

983
00:53:51.216 --> 00:53:53.468
OK, what about what happened at the roller coaster?
Huh?

984
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:54.511
Wendy saw it.

985
00:53:54.553 --> 00:53:55.561
Man, she got a hunch.

986
00:53:55.587 --> 00:53:57.432
Fuckin' intense, but she got a hunch.

987
00:53:57.473 --> 00:53:59.894
Man, I'm here because I get good hunches before every down.

988
00:53:59.935 --> 00:54:01.937
No, you know they're either gonna run or pass.

989
00:54:01.979 --> 00:54:03.564
Hers came to her from nowhere.

990
00:54:03.606 --> 00:54:05.317
You're here and alive because of her.

991
00:54:05.359 --> 00:54:06.860
No, I'm alive because of me.

992
00:54:06.902 --> 00:54:07.386
No, listen.

993
00:54:07.412 --> 00:54:08.444
You don't get it, man.

994
00:54:08.486 --> 00:54:09.822
Does that make sense to you?

995
00:54:09.863 --> 00:54:11.033
There's nothing to get, Kevin!

996
00:54:11.059 --> 00:54:11.657
It's bullshit.

997
00:54:11.699 --> 00:54:13.493
No, just hear me out, all right?

998
00:54:13.535 --> 00:54:14.536
Unh.

999
00:54:14.578 --> 00:54:15.954
# Yeah #

1000
00:54:21.169 --> 00:54:22.155
Talk about a vision.

1001
00:54:22.181 --> 00:54:24.173
Man, I seen my whole life played out...

1002
00:54:24.215 --> 00:54:26.635
and it sure as hell ain't gonna end now. Unh!

1003
00:54:26.676 --> 00:54:27.885
It's going just as I saw it.

1004
00:54:27.927 --> 00:54:31.181
35 high school games without an injury.

1005
00:54:31.223 --> 00:54:32.510
USA Today All-American.

1006
00:54:32.536 --> 00:54:33.517
Second team.

1007
00:54:33.559 --> 00:54:34.637
Free ride to play for the Sultans!

1008
00:54:34.664 --> 00:54:35.562
The Bruins passed on you.

1009
00:54:35.597 --> 00:54:37.105
Man, fuck the Bruins!

1010
00:54:37.147 --> 00:54:38.648
- Fuck 'em!
- You goddamn right!

1011
00:54:38.690 --> 00:54:40.735
What the fuck is a Bruin anyway?

1012
00:54:40.777 --> 00:54:42.362
Aah!

1013
00:54:42.403 --> 00:54:44.740
Unh! Unh! Unh!

1014
00:54:44.782 --> 00:54:46.367
Four years from now...

1015
00:54:46.408 --> 00:54:48.953
Lewis Romero goin' in the second round to Oakland.

1016
00:54:48.994 --> 00:54:50.663
Unh!

1017
00:54:50.705 --> 00:54:52.833
He's gonna romp and stomp.

1018
00:54:52.875 --> 00:54:56.838
15 seasons, with four Super Bowl rings on his fingers.

1019
00:54:56.921 --> 00:54:58.420
Lewis ain't afraid of no death.

1020
00:54:58.446 --> 00:54:59.049
Fuck Death!

1021
00:54:59.090 --> 00:55:01.469
Death is a fuckin' Denver fan.

1022
00:55:01.511 --> 00:55:03.221
Death wear blue and orange.

1023
00:55:03.262 --> 00:55:06.058
Real men wear black.

1024
00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:07.226
Lewis ain't afraid of no Death.

1025
00:55:07.268 --> 00:55:09.562
Death is afraid of me!

1026
00:55:09.603 --> 00:55:11.105
Death fears me!

1027
00:55:11.140 --> 00:55:12.356
Kevin.

1028
00:55:12.398 --> 00:55:13.556
'Cause, baby, I just win.

1029
00:55:13.582 --> 00:55:14.484
I just win, Kevin!

1030
00:55:14.526 --> 00:55:16.887
That's all I know how to do!

1031
00:55:16.913 --> 00:55:18.406
I just win! Unh!

1032
00:55:18.448 --> 00:55:19.741
Fuck Death!

1033
00:55:19.783 --> 00:55:21.743
- Fuck the Bruins!
- Yeah!

1034
00:55:21.785 --> 00:55:23.663
Aah!

1035
00:55:23.704 --> 00:55:25.122
- Look out!
- Lewis!

1036
00:55:27.292 --> 00:55:28.752
Man, that was close, Lewis.

1037
00:55:28.794 --> 00:55:30.753
Hey, did you see that?

1038
00:55:30.795 --> 00:55:34.258
Whoo! What I tell you, Kevin, huh?

1039
00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:36.261
Fuck Death!
 I just win!

1040
00:55:36.303 --> 00:55:37.679
That's all I know how to do, Kevin.

1041
00:55:37.721 --> 00:55:38.805
Baby, I just win!

1042
00:55:39.974 --> 00:55:41.059
Aaaaah!

1043
00:55:41.101 --> 00:55:43.395
- Ooooh!
- God!

1044
00:55:53.157 --> 00:55:55.618
Did I do something...

1045
00:55:57.788 --> 00:55:59.456
to bring this on everybody?

1046
00:55:59.498 --> 00:56:01.583
Don't, Wendy.

1047
00:56:01.668 --> 00:56:04.629
But why me?

1048
00:56:04.671 --> 00:56:06.966
All those people out there wanting to have a premonition...

1049
00:56:07.008 --> 00:56:09.802
or see a ghost or whatever, and I don't.

1050
00:56:12.930 --> 00:56:15.684
I just want it to stop.

1051
00:56:15.726 --> 00:56:17.561
Just stop.

1052
00:56:17.603 --> 00:56:20.315
I don't know why, Wendy...

1053
00:56:20.357 --> 00:56:22.901
but you didn't do anything.

1054
00:56:24.028 --> 00:56:26.573
All right? This is just...

1055
00:56:26.614 --> 00:56:27.083
I don't know.

1056
00:56:27.109 --> 00:56:28.492
I mean, I wish I knew why, you know?

1057
00:56:28.534 --> 00:56:31.286
I wish I could...
I could come up with a guess even...

1058
00:56:31.328 --> 00:56:33.498
to make you feel OK, but...

1059
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.379
You know, I can't.

1060
00:56:40.714 --> 00:56:42.092
Yeah.

1061
00:56:43.093 --> 00:56:44.761
There's nothing I can do.

1062
00:56:49.142 --> 00:56:50.561
Can you drive?

1063
00:56:51.562 --> 00:56:53.146
Heh.

1064
00:56:53.229 --> 00:56:54.482
Yeah.

1065
00:56:59.279 --> 00:57:00.198
You know, by the way, that...

1066
00:57:00.224 --> 00:57:00.864
that picture of me.

1067
00:57:00.906 --> 00:57:05.203
My, uh, my head's not, like, through the windshield or anything?

1068
00:57:05.245 --> 00:57:07.623
You know, crushed by a steering wheel?

1069
00:57:07.665 --> 00:57:09.500
Impaled by a gear shift?

1070
00:57:12.837 --> 00:57:14.005
Right?

1071
00:57:27.773 --> 00:57:29.442
Zip, it's Pip.

1072
00:57:29.484 --> 00:57:30.902
Have you cut those plywood orders yet?

1073
00:57:30.943 --> 00:57:32.445
Uh, that's a big no, Pip.

1074
00:57:32.487 --> 00:57:35.865
Osama bin Supervisor wants me to get rid of these pigeons first.

1075
00:57:35.907 --> 00:57:37.493
They keep settin' off the alarms.

1076
00:57:50.593 --> 00:57:52.637
Hello, babies.

1077
00:58:01.105 --> 00:58:03.316
Ha ha ha!

1078
00:58:03.357 --> 00:58:07.279
Oh, ha ha ha! Heh.

1079
00:58:11.117 --> 00:58:14.413
Hey. After I, uh, restock this stuff...

1080
00:58:14.454 --> 00:58:16.415
that these pinhead customers can't manage...

1081
00:58:16.456 --> 00:58:18.376
to return to the shelves themselves...

1082
00:58:18.418 --> 00:58:19.794
we can blow out of here, OK?

1083
00:58:19.836 --> 00:58:21.464
Righty-o, babe.

1084
00:58:25.802 --> 00:58:26.929
Aah!

1085
00:58:26.970 --> 00:58:28.722
Erin, it's Wendy and Kevin.

1086
00:58:28.764 --> 00:58:30.350
Shit!

1087
00:58:30.392 --> 00:58:32.275
You scared the shit out of me!

1088
00:58:32.310 --> 00:58:34.521
Yeah, wait till you hear what we have to tell you.

1089
00:58:43.115 --> 00:58:46.035
Zip, it's Pip. Come over here.

1090
00:58:46.077 --> 00:58:48.789
You are gonna trip when you hear this.

1091
00:58:48.830 --> 00:58:50.925
Well, paint me intrigued, Pip.

1092
00:58:50.951 --> 00:58:52.043
I'm on my way.

1093
00:58:52.085 --> 00:58:53.630
So let me get this straight.

1094
00:58:53.656 --> 00:58:55.504
I'm gonna O.D. on nail polish...

1095
00:58:55.546 --> 00:58:58.508
and Ian is gonna be embarrassed to death?

1096
00:58:58.550 --> 00:59:00.178
You saw what happened to Wendy, right?

1097
00:59:00.219 --> 00:59:01.507
What's happened to the others?

1098
00:59:01.533 --> 00:59:03.164
I mean, you just saw their pictures.

1099
00:59:13.695 --> 00:59:16.155
Oh, my God, guys, what's going on?

1100
00:59:16.196 --> 00:59:17.353
What's going on?

1101
00:59:17.380 --> 00:59:19.451
That's crazy! That's crazy!

1102
00:59:19.492 --> 00:59:21.328
Ha ha!

1103
00:59:22.413 --> 00:59:25.124
We need to know who was sitting behind you on the roller coaster.

1104
00:59:25.166 --> 00:59:28.358
OK, who was sitting behind us on the roller coaster?

1105
00:59:28.393 --> 00:59:29.167
Oh! Oh, wait!

1106
00:59:29.193 --> 00:59:31.550
Wasn't it that one guy who got voted...

1107
00:59:31.585 --> 00:59:34.386
most likely to become manager at Red Lobster?

1108
00:59:34.428 --> 00:59:35.638
Oh, no. You know what?
God, I remember.

1109
00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:37.431
There was this guy, uh, black cloak...

1110
00:59:37.473 --> 00:59:39.016
I didn't see his face, but, um...

1111
00:59:39.058 --> 00:59:41.227
the ride attendant did take his sickle...

1112
00:59:41.269 --> 00:59:44.649
before the ride started if that's helpful in any way.

1113
00:59:44.690 --> 00:59:46.567
Do you think we care if you laugh at us?

1114
00:59:46.602 --> 00:59:48.070
This is our lives, OK?

1115
00:59:48.112 --> 00:59:49.216
What choice do we have?

1116
00:59:49.242 --> 00:59:50.176
Just give into it?

1117
00:59:50.211 --> 00:59:51.278
Oh, God. You know what?

1118
00:59:51.304 --> 00:59:52.207
There is no "it. "

1119
00:59:52.242 --> 00:59:55.162
OK, wait, are you guys saying that Death is, like, a person?

1120
00:59:55.203 --> 00:59:57.831
No. It's like... like a force.

1121
00:59:57.873 --> 00:59:59.708
Yeah. Well, you know what?

1122
00:59:59.734 --> 01:00:01.544
A force is just a force.

1123
01:00:01.586 --> 01:00:02.596
It's nothing else.

1124
01:00:02.622 --> 01:00:04.054
Just transferred energy.

1125
01:00:04.089 --> 01:00:07.552
I mean, it has no goals, no awareness that is a force.

1126
01:00:07.593 --> 01:00:09.262
But there is awareness, McKinley.

1127
01:00:09.303 --> 01:00:11.765
In fact, in past cases, if the next in line is saved...

1128
01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:12.880
it'd skip that person.

1129
01:00:12.906 --> 01:00:14.060
That's why we're here.

1130
01:00:14.102 --> 01:00:15.854
Oh, man,
what have you been smoking?

1131
01:00:17.271 --> 01:00:20.108
Ha ha!

1132
01:00:22.444 --> 01:00:24.906
- Top shelf.
- OK.

1153
01:00:32.916 --> 01:00:34.154
Kevin! Those banners.

1154
01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:35.653
They're in the picture.

1155
01:00:37.297 --> 01:00:38.798
Ian, watch those boxes!

1156
01:00:43.971 --> 01:00:44.952
What the fuck, man?

1157
01:00:44.978 --> 01:00:46.808
You said those boxes were falling!

1158
01:00:46.843 --> 01:00:48.601
No, I said watch the boxes.

1159
01:00:48.643 --> 01:00:49.245
Really? What for?

1160
01:00:49.271 --> 01:00:50.271
They're not doing anything.

1161
01:00:50.313 --> 01:00:53.233
We're not gonna apologize for trying to save you.

1162
01:00:53.275 --> 01:00:57.154
You haven't seen or been through what we have... yet.

1163
01:00:57.189 --> 01:00:58.781
Oh. Yet.

1164
01:00:58.822 --> 01:01:02.035
OK, so who's next in this theory you have, me or Ian?

1165
01:01:02.077 --> 01:01:04.454
Well, we know the order of how we were sitting on the roller coaster...

1166
01:01:04.496 --> 01:01:06.916
but not how it works with people who sat together.

1167
01:01:06.958 --> 01:01:09.753
OK, we don't know if Ashley or Ashlyn died first.

1168
01:01:09.794 --> 01:01:12.423
Hmm. God, Death is fucking complicated.

1169
01:01:12.465 --> 01:01:13.883
Ha ha!

1170
01:01:13.925 --> 01:01:14.841
No, you know what?

1171
01:01:14.867 --> 01:01:16.011
It's not complicated.

1172
01:01:16.053 --> 01:01:18.639
It's simple. People die.

1173
01:01:18.681 --> 01:01:20.057
That's just part of life.

1174
01:01:20.099 --> 01:01:22.852
150,000 people a day, actually.

1175
01:01:22.893 --> 01:01:24.813
You know? I mean...

1176
01:01:24.855 --> 01:01:26.857
we're biological entities, and death is just...

1177
01:01:26.898 --> 01:01:29.193
- Top shelf.
- the end of biological function.

1178
01:01:29.235 --> 01:01:30.236
It's as simple as that.

1179
01:01:37.162 --> 01:01:39.622
How can you explain what happened to us as simple?

1180
01:01:39.664 --> 01:01:41.458
I mean, if Wendy never had that premonition...

1181
01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:44.003
and none of us had gotten off that ride, we'd all be dead right now.

1182
01:01:44.044 --> 01:01:46.346
- Does that not make sense to you?
- Oh, yeah.

1183
01:01:46.381 --> 01:01:50.303
Kevin, how come when a guy dies of a plain heart attack...

1184
01:01:50.345 --> 01:01:51.971
no one goes, like...

1185
01:01:52.013 --> 01:01:55.142
"Oh, wow, he was eating French toast...

1186
01:01:55.184 --> 01:01:56.977
"when Princess Diana died in Paris...

1187
01:01:57.019 --> 01:02:00.189
"and then he saw her funeral on TV, and now he's dead"?

1188
01:02:00.231 --> 01:02:00.674
You know why?

1189
01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:01.732
Because they'd sound crazy...

1190
01:02:01.774 --> 01:02:05.237
so guess how you two sound right now? Crazy.

1191
01:02:05.279 --> 01:02:05.970
Zip, I'm done.

1192
01:02:05.996 --> 01:02:07.699
So finish cutting those orders...

1193
01:02:07.741 --> 01:02:09.075
- so we can get out of here.
- OK!

1194
01:02:57.093 --> 01:02:58.094
Unh!

1195
01:03:00.598 --> 01:03:01.599
Heh heh!

1196
01:03:14.614 --> 01:03:16.032
Ugh!

1197
01:03:16.074 --> 01:03:17.660
Sick.

1198
01:03:52.953 --> 01:03:54.788
OK.

1199
01:03:54.830 --> 01:03:56.791
Let's go with what you guys are saying.

1200
01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:58.126
Let's just say, you know...

1201
01:03:58.168 --> 01:04:00.588
that Death does have a conscious plan...

1202
01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:02.965
and that it's been set into motion. Great.

1203
01:04:03.007 --> 01:04:06.177
So, Newton's third law of motion, and, well, look...

1204
01:04:06.219 --> 01:04:08.054
I'm just guessing that it goes for Death, too...

1205
01:04:08.089 --> 01:04:09.890
when he's working in our world.

1206
01:04:09.932 --> 01:04:13.895
Newton says that every action
has an equal and opposite reaction.

1207
01:04:13.930 --> 01:04:16.982
So, that means that...

1208
01:04:17.024 --> 01:04:20.904
if Death has taken action, so can we.

1209
01:04:20.945 --> 01:04:23.157
And that that action we take might have...

1210
01:04:23.199 --> 01:04:25.742
an opposite reaction that thwarts Death's intent.

1211
01:04:25.784 --> 01:04:27.537
You're being a fucker, but go on.

1212
01:04:27.578 --> 01:04:30.415
OK. OK.

1213
01:04:30.456 --> 01:04:33.711
What if, for example...

1214
01:04:33.752 --> 01:04:38.550
the last in line were to make the utilitarian choice...

1215
01:04:39.886 --> 01:04:41.054
Kill themselves.

1216
01:04:43.223 --> 01:04:43.708
Wow! Wow!

1217
01:04:43.734 --> 01:04:45.642
That's pretty much gonna ruin any plan...

1218
01:04:45.684 --> 01:04:47.241
that Death's put in motion.

1219
01:04:47.267 --> 01:04:48.396
And even better...

1220
01:04:48.437 --> 01:04:52.275
hey, it's gonna save five skipped lives.

1221
01:04:58.408 --> 01:04:59.993
Any takers?

1222
01:05:02.622 --> 01:05:04.916
Nah, I didn't think so.

1223
01:05:14.595 --> 01:05:16.055
There! Those!

1224
01:05:19.559 --> 01:05:21.269
Ugh!

1225
01:05:21.311 --> 01:05:22.688
Aah!

1226
01:05:25.358 --> 01:05:26.942
Ooh!

1227
01:05:34.243 --> 01:05:35.244
Aah!

1228
01:05:36.246 --> 01:05:37.247
Unh! Unh!

1229
01:05:39.458 --> 01:05:40.669
Unh!

1230
01:05:53.934 --> 01:05:56.187
Aah!

1231
01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:16.075
I didn't say anything.

1232
01:06:16.101 --> 01:06:17.088
I mean, I think...

1233
01:06:17.129 --> 01:06:18.589
they were trying to scare us into saying something...

1234
01:06:18.631 --> 01:06:20.634
but they had nothing to keep me there.

1235
01:06:20.676 --> 01:06:22.094
What'd you tell 'em?

1236
01:06:22.136 --> 01:06:24.347
Everything.
I didn't do anything.

1237
01:06:24.389 --> 01:06:26.182
I told them about the pictures in the camera...

1238
01:06:26.224 --> 01:06:27.392
and Flight 180 and Frankie and Lewis...

1239
01:06:27.433 --> 01:06:29.811
and why we went to see Ian and Erin and...

1240
01:06:29.853 --> 01:06:31.271
Did they believe you?

1241
01:06:31.313 --> 01:06:32.014
Yeah, right.

1242
01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:33.358
Would you believe me?

1243
01:06:33.399 --> 01:06:35.860
No, they looked at me like I was crazy.

1244
01:06:35.902 --> 01:06:38.364
10 hours they had us in there.

1245
01:06:38.406 --> 01:06:39.740
For all we know...

1246
01:06:39.782 --> 01:06:41.660
whoever was sitting behind Erin is already dead.

1247
01:06:41.702 --> 01:06:43.245
And we're next.

1248
01:06:43.287 --> 01:06:44.830
Now.

1249
01:06:47.667 --> 01:06:51.755
Ian almost died first, but we intervened.

1250
01:06:51.797 --> 01:06:52.828
So it skipped Ian.

1251
01:06:52.854 --> 01:06:55.176
That's... that's how we regain control.

1252
01:06:55.218 --> 01:06:56.511
If someone intercedes...

1253
01:06:56.552 --> 01:06:58.430
the life that was supposed to be next is skipped.

1254
01:06:58.465 --> 01:06:59.682
All right, wait, wait, wait.

1255
01:06:59.723 --> 01:07:02.226
So, going by the way we sat on the roller coaster...

1256
01:07:03.687 --> 01:07:06.857
Well, I'm next... and then you.

1257
01:07:06.899 --> 01:07:10.069
We can beat this.

1258
01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:11.325
We're so close.

1259
01:07:11.351 --> 01:07:12.889
We can't give up.

1260
01:07:14.115 --> 01:07:15.499
All right, my dad's here.

1261
01:07:15.525 --> 01:07:17.328
He's gonna give me a ride back.

1262
01:07:17.370 --> 01:07:20.332
But are you sure we shouldn't stick together?

1263
01:07:20.374 --> 01:07:22.251
It's just for a couple of hours.

1264
01:07:22.293 --> 01:07:23.252
All right? A couple of hours.

1265
01:07:23.294 --> 01:07:26.256
Go back, look at the pictures, see if you can find any more clues...

1266
01:07:26.298 --> 01:07:30.010
and I'll ask everybody I see if they know if anyone else got off the ride.

1267
01:07:30.052 --> 01:07:32.096
OK?

1268
01:07:34.474 --> 01:07:36.768
Was there something I should know about going?

1269
01:07:38.604 --> 01:07:40.773
No, it's just...

1270
01:07:40.815 --> 01:07:43.277
I'll just be freaking out every second...

1271
01:07:43.319 --> 01:07:45.279
hoping you're OK.

1272
01:07:45.321 --> 01:07:47.282
Why?

1273
01:07:48.575 --> 01:07:50.493
I mean, we don't even like each other.

1274
01:07:50.534 --> 01:07:53.163
Heh.

1275
01:07:54.248 --> 01:07:55.750
Come here.

1276
01:08:00.798 --> 01:08:01.966
OK?

1277
01:08:02.008 --> 01:08:03.802
All right, I got my cell.

1278
01:08:03.844 --> 01:08:05.137
OK.

1279
01:08:23.242 --> 01:08:24.494
Hey, Wen?

1280
01:08:24.535 --> 01:08:26.330
So we're meeting some guys at that centennial thing...

1281
01:08:26.372 --> 01:08:30.502
and I could really use my good-luck... bracelet.

1282
01:08:47.356 --> 01:08:48.357
Mmm.

1283
01:09:00.078 --> 01:09:01.206
Huh.

1284
01:09:31.451 --> 01:09:33.421
Hey, this is Julie.

1285
01:09:33.447 --> 01:09:35.289
Leave a message.

1286
01:09:35.331 --> 01:09:37.249
Call me on my cell right away.

1287
01:09:42.798 --> 01:09:44.050
Hello?

1288
01:09:44.092 --> 01:09:45.969
Do you remember Julie being on the roller coaster?

1289
01:09:46.010 --> 01:09:47.846
What, your sister? No.

1290
01:09:47.887 --> 01:09:49.223
No, she would've said something by now.

1291
01:09:49.265 --> 01:09:50.808
The person sitting behind Ian and Erin...

1292
01:09:50.850 --> 01:09:52.477
was wearing the exact same charm bracelet...

1293
01:09:52.519 --> 01:09:54.270
our grandmother gave her.

1294
01:09:54.312 --> 01:09:56.272
Amber or Perry were probably with her...

1295
01:09:56.314 --> 01:09:58.067
so they're next.

1296
01:09:58.108 --> 01:09:59.450
I gotta find Julie.

1297
01:09:59.485 --> 01:10:00.611
She went to the tricentennial thing.

1298
01:10:00.653 --> 01:10:02.614
Well, I... I'm here now, working security.

1299
01:10:02.656 --> 01:10:04.282
I'll start looking for her.

1300
01:10:04.324 --> 01:10:05.239
I'm on my way.

1301
01:10:05.265 --> 01:10:06.285
Wen, wait.

1302
01:10:06.327 --> 01:10:07.996
Look, after them, we're next.

1303
01:10:08.037 --> 01:10:10.291
So in case somethin' happens to 'em...

1304
01:10:10.332 --> 01:10:12.001
before we meet up...

1305
01:10:12.042 --> 01:10:13.793
remember that time we talked about?

1306
01:10:13.835 --> 01:10:15.504
When to look at our pictures?

1307
01:10:15.546 --> 01:10:17.298
It's now.

1308
01:10:26.852 --> 01:10:28.604
Great. Mine has no clue.

1309
01:10:28.646 --> 01:10:31.399
It's just me standing in front of a blank background...

1310
01:10:31.441 --> 01:10:33.819
with Jason at the amusement park.

1311
01:10:33.861 --> 01:10:36.822
Wait. McKinley.

1312
01:10:36.864 --> 01:10:39.951
Ian? Is he in the picture?

1313
01:10:39.992 --> 01:10:43.580
No, but it... it feels like a clue.

1314
01:10:44.874 --> 01:10:46.918
And yours is the picture that I took...

1315
01:10:46.953 --> 01:10:48.963
when I flashed the camera in your face.

1316
01:10:49.005 --> 01:10:52.967
It's all out of focus and overexposed, like...

1317
01:10:58.557 --> 01:11:00.226
Like a firework went off in my face?

1318
01:11:25.757 --> 01:11:28.970
# There is someone #

1319
01:11:29.012 --> 01:11:32.140
# Walking behind you #

1320
01:11:35.394 --> 01:11:38.606
# Look at me #

1321
01:11:38.648 --> 01:11:40.483
# There is someone #

1322
01:11:40.525 --> 01:11:44.447
# Watching your footsteps #

1323
01:11:47.159 --> 01:11:49.077
# Look at me #

1324
01:11:50.663 --> 01:11:54.042
# There is someone #

1325
01:11:54.084 --> 01:11:56.295
# Who really loves you #

1326
01:11:56.337 --> 01:11:58.463
The British are coming!
The British are coming!

1327
01:11:58.505 --> 01:12:01.050
- Whoo!
- Yay!

1328
01:12:01.092 --> 01:12:02.677
Get 'em while they're hot!

1329
01:12:07.392 --> 01:12:09.561
Take it to those Redcoats!

1330
01:12:09.603 --> 01:12:11.898
Column, advance!

1331
01:12:23.953 --> 01:12:25.831
The kite is aloft.

1332
01:12:27.333 --> 01:12:30.128
Now, let us hope for some lightning.

1333
01:12:30.170 --> 01:12:32.714
Fuck you, Ben Franklin.

1334
01:12:40.974 --> 01:12:42.459
But he kept insisting.

1335
01:12:42.485 --> 01:12:44.170
"Get over here," right?

1336
01:12:46.356 --> 01:12:48.484
This is awesome, dude!

1337
01:12:48.525 --> 01:12:49.777
Heh heh.

1338
01:12:49.819 --> 01:12:51.161
Whoa. Hey!

1339
01:12:51.196 --> 01:12:52.656
Ha ha! Come on!

1340
01:12:52.698 --> 01:12:53.826
Hey, get out of here with those, man!

1341
01:12:53.852 --> 01:12:54.658
You're gonna set these off!

1342
01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:56.167
Hurry, dude.

1343
01:12:56.202 --> 01:12:57.161
Come on, man, let's go!

1344
01:12:57.187 --> 01:12:57.645
Hurry up!

1345
01:12:59.121 --> 01:13:02.834
Ladies and gentlemen, to celebrate McKinley's tricentennial...

1346
01:13:02.876 --> 01:13:05.630
the fireworks extravaganza will begin shortly.

1347
01:13:10.761 --> 01:13:12.304
Oh, my God. Julie.

1348
01:13:12.346 --> 01:13:13.306
- What?
- Look.

1349
01:13:13.348 --> 01:13:15.225
There's Kahlil.

1350
01:13:15.267 --> 01:13:16.853
Should we?

1351
01:13:16.894 --> 01:13:17.235
Hey, guys.

1352
01:13:17.261 --> 01:13:18.563
I'm sorry, but you can't be here, OK?

1353
01:13:18.605 --> 01:13:19.897
The viewing site is over there.

1354
01:13:19.923 --> 01:13:20.898
You too, sir. Come on.

1355
01:13:20.939 --> 01:13:22.776
They're not gonna make us move, are they?

1356
01:13:22.817 --> 01:13:24.402
I don't fucking believe them.

1357
01:13:24.444 --> 01:13:26.948
- OK, we gotta clear out.
- Mm-hm.

1358
01:13:33.539 --> 01:13:35.041
Excuse me.

1359
01:14:00.154 --> 01:14:01.698
- Ladies.
- Boys.

1360
01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:02.699
What's going on?

1361
01:14:03.951 --> 01:14:05.745
Hey, Julie.

1362
01:14:05.787 --> 01:14:07.301
You three need to come with me.

1363
01:14:07.327 --> 01:14:08.248
What did we do?

1364
01:14:08.289 --> 01:14:09.959
Look, it's for your own safety, Julie, all right?

1365
01:14:10.001 --> 01:14:11.836
I'll tell you about it as soon as we get away from here, OK?

1366
01:14:11.877 --> 01:14:13.714
Let go of me!

1367
01:14:13.755 --> 01:14:14.798
Julie.

1368
01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:16.050
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1369
01:14:16.091 --> 01:14:17.259
Julie!

1370
01:14:45.043 --> 01:14:46.086
Heh heh heh!

1371
01:14:47.629 --> 01:14:49.048
- Sweet.
- Ha ha!

1372
01:14:52.343 --> 01:14:53.304
Yeah!

1373
01:14:56.682 --> 01:14:57.326
Light it! Light it!

1374
01:14:57.352 --> 01:14:57.960
Go, go, go, man!

1375
01:15:03.691 --> 01:15:05.484
Julie!

1376
01:15:09.239 --> 01:15:10.742
Uh! Oh!

1377
01:15:15.164 --> 01:15:16.707
- Oh, shit!
- Dude, we gotta bail!

1378
01:15:31.224 --> 01:15:32.518
- Aah!
- Unh!

1379
01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:34.854
Unh! Hey!

1380
01:15:36.357 --> 01:15:39.527
Julie! No, wait, wait.

1381
01:15:39.568 --> 01:15:40.525
You're in danger, OK?

1382
01:15:40.551 --> 01:15:42.072
I'm trying to explain something.

1383
01:15:42.107 --> 01:15:44.825
Let me explain this to you.

1384
01:15:48.746 --> 01:15:50.165
Julie, look out!

1385
01:15:51.541 --> 01:15:53.335
- Aah!
- Unh!

1386
01:15:54.879 --> 01:15:56.673
Aah!

1387
01:15:56.714 --> 01:15:57.800
Julie!

1388
01:15:58.801 --> 01:16:00.344
Unh!

1389
01:16:00.386 --> 01:16:02.222
Aah! Unh!

1390
01:16:04.098 --> 01:16:05.641
Cut him off!

1391
01:16:10.564 --> 01:16:11.858
Unh!

1392
01:16:13.443 --> 01:16:14.402
Aah!

1393
01:16:17.698 --> 01:16:18.700
Aah!

1394
01:16:21.161 --> 01:16:22.580
Aah!

1395
01:16:30.088 --> 01:16:31.423
OK, OK.

1396
01:16:33.802 --> 01:16:35.136
Stay back!
He's dangerous!

1397
01:16:38.599 --> 01:16:39.725
I got him.

1398
01:16:39.767 --> 01:16:41.937
- Just let me go.
- No, Julie.

1399
01:16:41.979 --> 01:16:43.188
You have to tell me, you have to listen.

1400
01:16:43.230 --> 01:16:45.481
Tell me who was sitting next to you on the roller coaster!

1401
01:16:45.523 --> 01:16:47.401
Oh, my God, Julie, are you all right?

1402
01:16:49.111 --> 01:16:49.565
Listen to me!

1403
01:16:49.591 --> 01:16:50.405
You have to tell me...

1404
01:16:50.447 --> 01:16:52.282
who was sitting next to you on the roller coaster!

1405
01:16:52.324 --> 01:16:54.744
Who? She's next!

1406
01:16:59.333 --> 01:17:01.002
Aah!

1407
01:17:13.350 --> 01:17:14.685
Kevin.

1408
01:17:24.781 --> 01:17:26.282
Aah!

1409
01:17:26.324 --> 01:17:27.992
Fire!

1410
01:17:28.034 --> 01:17:30.204
Kevin.

1411
01:17:30.246 --> 01:17:33.792
You saved my life.

1412
01:17:39.507 --> 01:17:40.884
Thanks for that, McKinley.

1413
01:17:40.925 --> 01:17:42.887
- Shut up, McKinley!
- No!

1414
01:17:42.928 --> 01:17:44.388
We have to get out of here now.

1415
01:17:44.430 --> 01:17:45.598
What's the deal?

1416
01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:46.629
Ian McKinley.

1417
01:17:46.655 --> 01:17:48.226
He causes my death.

1418
01:17:48.267 --> 01:17:50.395
In my picture I was wearing the McKinley grad night shirt.

1419
01:17:50.436 --> 01:17:52.189
- He's the clue.
- What?

1420
01:17:52.231 --> 01:17:54.233
There's a first aid tent, there should be security.

1421
01:17:56.403 --> 01:17:58.370
Get the fuck outta here, McKinley!

1422
01:17:58.405 --> 01:18:02.494
Hey, I'm just celebrating our town's tricentennial.

1423
01:18:05.581 --> 01:18:06.665
You followed me!

1424
01:18:06.706 --> 01:18:08.584
Oh! You are paranoid.

1425
01:18:08.626 --> 01:18:10.711
But, hey, I saw what happened.

1426
01:18:10.753 --> 01:18:11.722
You're next, right?

1427
01:18:11.748 --> 01:18:13.507
You're the end of it, aren't you?

1428
01:18:13.549 --> 01:18:14.925
Man, I would be paranoid, too.

1429
01:18:14.967 --> 01:18:16.760
You didn't even believe me!

1430
01:18:16.802 --> 01:18:19.890
Yeah, well, seeing is believing.

1431
01:18:19.931 --> 01:18:21.601
Then you have to stay away from me!

1432
01:18:21.642 --> 01:18:22.659
"Have to"?

1433
01:18:22.685 --> 01:18:24.921
Wow, that's extreme.

1434
01:18:29.609 --> 01:18:31.737
Oh, no way.

1435
01:18:33.406 --> 01:18:35.075
Do I cause your death?

1436
01:18:36.785 --> 01:18:38.705
Just like you caused Erin's?

1437
01:18:39.748 --> 01:18:41.750
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what?
What?

1438
01:18:41.792 --> 01:18:44.629
You have a vision? Was I in it?

1439
01:18:44.671 --> 01:18:46.589
Was I in a picture?

1440
01:18:48.842 --> 01:18:51.302
Just tell me how to start it off!

1441
01:18:51.337 --> 01:18:53.973
Let's get this over with!

1442
01:18:54.015 --> 01:18:56.768
You'll save me if you just stay away!

1443
01:18:56.810 --> 01:18:58.103
Then it'll all be over!

1444
01:18:58.145 --> 01:19:01.107
What do I care? It skipped me.

1445
01:19:01.149 --> 01:19:02.123
For me, it is over.

1446
01:19:02.149 --> 01:19:02.943
I'm not dying.

1447
01:19:02.984 --> 01:19:05.822
I'm not dying!

1448
01:19:16.334 --> 01:19:18.045
Ha ha ha!

1449
01:19:18.086 --> 01:19:20.130
You see?

1450
01:19:20.172 --> 01:19:21.465
I'm not gonna die!

1451
01:19:21.507 --> 01:19:22.731
It's you, Wendy!

1452
01:19:22.757 --> 01:19:23.827
You're dead!

1453
01:19:59.428 --> 01:20:02.641
# Came back down from this fight #

1454
01:20:02.683 --> 01:20:04.142
- Hi!
- # Will get ya deeper #

1455
01:20:04.226 --> 01:20:05.561
# And make you right #

1456
01:20:05.602 --> 01:20:06.646
Thank you.

1457
01:20:06.688 --> 01:20:09.441
# Bruno's drops threaten her... #

1458
01:20:09.482 --> 01:20:10.692
Wait, what about that great curry place?

1459
01:20:10.734 --> 01:20:12.152
Don't we get off at Booth?

1460
01:20:12.194 --> 01:20:13.050
Oh, you mean Gupta's.

1461
01:20:13.076 --> 01:20:14.029
You get off at Oswald.

1462
01:20:14.070 --> 01:20:15.656
Oh, that's right.

1463
01:20:16.908 --> 01:20:19.370
You know, if I can't be home for Thanksgiving...

1464
01:20:19.411 --> 01:20:22.164
I need some semblance of a traditional dinner.

1465
01:20:22.206 --> 01:20:24.376
Turkey, stuffing, pie.

1466
01:20:24.668 --> 01:20:25.961
If you don't have turkey for one Thanksgiving...

1467
01:20:26.003 --> 01:20:27.630
is that really gonna kill you?

1468
01:20:28.631 --> 01:20:31.759
# There is someone #

1469
01:20:31.801 --> 01:20:35.263
# Walking behind you #

1470
01:20:35.305 --> 01:20:38.601
# Turn around #

1471
01:20:38.643 --> 01:20:42.356
# Look at me #

1472
01:20:42.398 --> 01:20:45.736
# There is someone #

1473
01:20:45.777 --> 01:20:49.657
# Watching your footsteps #

1474
01:20:49.699 --> 01:20:50.950
# Turn around #

1475
01:20:58.501 --> 01:21:01.754
# There is someone #

1476
01:21:01.796 --> 01:21:05.926
# Who really needs you #

1477
01:21:05.968 --> 01:21:08.847
# Here's my heart #

1478
01:21:38.049 --> 01:21:40.593
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

1479
01:21:43.431 --> 01:21:44.807
This is Booth Street.

1480
01:21:44.849 --> 01:21:47.177
Next stop is Oswald.

1481
01:21:47.203 --> 01:21:49.271
End of the line.

1482
01:21:49.313 --> 01:21:53.359
The next stop is the end of the line.

1483
01:21:54.403 --> 01:21:57.155
Wendy! Next stop after this.

1484
01:21:57.197 --> 01:21:58.115
Let's just walk.

1485
01:21:58.141 --> 01:21:59.492
It's freezing out.

1486
01:21:59.527 --> 01:22:01.161
Yeah, but the air'll feel good.

1487
01:22:01.196 --> 01:22:03.956
I could use some air.

1488
01:22:06.501 --> 01:22:09.046
Yeah!

1489
01:22:09.088 --> 01:22:10.381
Ha ha ha! Yeah, man!

1490
01:22:10.416 --> 01:22:11.674
All right, man. See ya.

1491
01:22:11.715 --> 01:22:12.759
Let's go, Bruins!

1492
01:22:12.801 --> 01:22:13.801
Bruins, yeah!

1493
01:22:29.696 --> 01:22:31.198
Hey, man, peace out!

1494
01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:32.783
- Come on.
- Excuse me.

1495
01:22:32.825 --> 01:22:35.202
- Watch out!
- Hey, Bruins!

1496
01:22:35.244 --> 01:22:36.382
You missed the beginning.

1497
01:22:36.408 --> 01:22:37.246
Did you see that?

1498
01:22:37.288 --> 01:22:38.415
This is it!

1499
01:22:38.457 --> 01:22:42.085
Yo, comin' through. Excuse me.

1500
01:22:44.130 --> 01:22:46.049
Oh, my God.

1501
01:22:47.051 --> 01:22:50.846
I can't believe this. Here.

1502
01:22:52.558 --> 01:22:55.526
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

1503
01:22:55.561 --> 01:22:58.230
I thought you weren't coming till tonight.

1504
01:22:58.272 --> 01:23:00.734
Well, Dad's car just, like, dies out of nowhere...

1505
01:23:00.775 --> 01:23:02.569
and he couldn't get it fixed anywhere on a holiday...

1506
01:23:02.604 --> 01:23:03.945
so instead of sitting around for a few hours...

1507
01:23:03.987 --> 01:23:05.907
I lucked out and caught an early train.

1508
01:23:05.949 --> 01:23:07.742
I hope I'm not messing you up or...

1509
01:23:07.784 --> 01:23:09.912
No, no, it's just, um...

1510
01:23:09.954 --> 01:23:13.709
I think I had a sense that you were coming now.

1511
01:23:17.588 --> 01:23:20.049
I was just...

1512
01:23:20.090 --> 01:23:23.428
I was feeling like I did that night.

1513
01:23:24.429 --> 01:23:26.391
No. No, it's over.

1514
01:23:26.432 --> 01:23:29.310
You, me, Kevin went over a thousand scenarios.

1515
01:23:29.352 --> 01:23:30.646
Ian was gonna cause your death...

1516
01:23:30.688 --> 01:23:32.481
you intervened, and it skipped us.

1517
01:23:39.156 --> 01:23:41.909
Look, I'm not worried.

1518
01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:43.610
I ran into Kevin at home.

1519
01:23:43.636 --> 01:23:44.871
He's not worried.

1520
01:23:44.913 --> 01:23:46.164
And, if I were you...

1521
01:23:46.206 --> 01:23:48.584
until something happens to me and then Kevin...

1522
01:23:48.626 --> 01:23:50.253
you've got nothing to worry about.

1523
01:23:51.588 --> 01:23:53.424
You're right.

1524
01:23:53.465 --> 01:23:55.266
Uhh.

1525
01:23:55.301 --> 01:23:57.470
Hey, I... I want you to meet my roommate and my friend, OK?

1526
01:23:57.511 --> 01:23:58.596
Yeah.

1527
01:24:00.557 --> 01:24:01.975
Hey, guys.
This is Julie, my...

1528
01:24:13.616 --> 01:24:15.951
What are you doing here?

1529
01:24:15.993 --> 01:24:18.162
Wendy! Julie!

1530
01:24:18.204 --> 01:24:20.122
What are the chances?

1531
01:24:20.164 --> 01:24:21.499
How long have you been on this train?

1532
01:24:21.540 --> 01:24:23.126
Uh, since home.

1533
01:24:23.168 --> 01:24:25.003
I was headin' up to check out the game.

1534
01:24:25.045 --> 01:24:26.630
I was gonna look you up afterwards.

1535
01:24:29.217 --> 01:24:30.468
You OK?

1536
01:24:30.510 --> 01:24:32.263
Is something wrong?

1537
01:24:40.856 --> 01:24:41.857
Aah!

1538
01:24:53.205 --> 01:24:54.874
Aah!

1539
01:25:01.130 --> 01:25:02.383
Aah!

1540
01:25:04.969 --> 01:25:07.681
- Aah!
- Unh!

1541
01:25:10.226 --> 01:25:12.187
- Julie, stay down!
- Aah!

1542
01:25:12.228 --> 01:25:14.482
Julie!

1543
01:25:14.523 --> 01:25:15.524
Aah!

1544
01:25:20.655 --> 01:25:22.115
- Kevin!
- Unh!

1545
01:25:23.742 --> 01:25:24.827
Aaaaaah!

1546
01:25:25.828 --> 01:25:27.664
Oh, God!

1547
01:25:27.706 --> 01:25:28.832
Aah!

1548
01:25:29.833 --> 01:25:32.253
Aah!

1549
01:26:18.977 --> 01:26:21.062
Aah! Unh!

1550
01:26:39.586 --> 01:26:43.173
No!

1551
01:26:43.214 --> 01:26:46.510
I was gonna look you up afterwards, but...

1552
01:26:47.929 --> 01:26:48.971
You OK?

1553
01:26:49.013 --> 01:26:51.517
Is somethin' wrong?

1554
01:26:52.601 --> 01:26:54.813
The train...

1555
01:26:54.854 --> 01:26:56.376
Oh, shit.
Not again.

1556
01:26:56.411 --> 01:26:57.947
The train... 1366

1557
01:26:57.982 --> 01:26:58.754
1369We gotta get out!

1558
01:26:58.789 --> 01:27:00.681
Oh, shit.
Not again. 1367

1559
01:27:00.716 --> 01:27:03.143
1370 It's not working.

1560
01:27:03.178 --> 01:27:05.572
We gotta get out!
