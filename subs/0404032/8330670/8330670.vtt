<i>Dr. Mueller,</i>

367
00:24:40.021 --> 00:24:42.272
<i>what's your position
at the university hospital?</i>

368
00:24:42.273 --> 00:24:45.150
I am chairman
of the Department of Neurology.

369
00:24:45.151 --> 00:24:47.944
And after you heard about
the dorm-room incident,

370
00:24:47.945 --> 00:24:49.654
what were your initial thoughts?

371
00:24:49.655 --> 00:24:52.782
At first, I thought perhaps
Emily had taken illegal drugs,

372
00:24:52.783 --> 00:24:55.327
some type of hallucinogen.

373
00:24:55.328 --> 00:24:58.747
But we ran tests and found
no trace of drugs in her system.

374
00:24:58.748 --> 00:25:01.250
And the more she explained
the incident to me,

375
00:25:01.251 --> 00:25:04.920
the more I began to suspect
something else.

<i>of all the muscles of the body.</i>

THOMAS: <i>Is it possible for a
person suffering from such a seizure</i>

383
00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:22.562
<i>to have hallucinations</i>

384
00:25:22.563 --> 00:25:24.773
<i>or perceive the things
that Emily described?</i>

385
00:25:24.774 --> 00:25:26.524
<i>The muscle contractions
could feel</i>

386
00:25:26.525 --> 00:25:28.360
<i>like an extreme pressure
on the body,</i>

387
00:25:28.361 --> 00:25:31.280
<i>and it is certainly possible

388
00:25:31.281 --> 00:25:32.989
for a person to perceive

389
00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:35.658
all sorts of strange
and violent things.

390
00:25:35.659 --> 00:25:38.578
So suspecting
that Emily was epileptic,

391
00:25:38.579 --> 00:25:39.829
how did you proceed?

392
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:41.915
I administered
an electroencephalograph.

393
00:25:41.916 --> 00:25:43.333
What did the EEG reveal?

394
00:25:43.334 --> 00:25:45.794
It showed
a possible epileptic focus

395
00:25:45.795 --> 00:25:47.796
in the patient's
left temporal lobe.

396
00:25:47.797 --> 00:25:49.881
Did this require
specific treatment?

397
00:25:49.882 --> 00:25:51.841
Yes, I began
a medication schedule for Emily

398
00:25:51.842 --> 00:25:53.551
with the drug Gambutrol.

399
00:25:53.552 --> 00:25:57.431
I also advised regular follow-up
examinations and further tests.

400
00:25:57.432 --> 00:26:00.600
But Emily failed to keep her
follow-up appointments with me.

401
00:26:00.601 --> 00:26:02.018
Did she give any reason

402
00:26:02.019 --> 00:26:03.895
for discontinuing
these appointments?

403
00:26:03.896 --> 00:26:06.398
Yes, she told me she was
convinced that her condition

404
00:26:06.399 --> 00:26:07.774
was a spiritual one.

405
00:26:07.775 --> 00:26:10.527
It was the conviction
of her priest, she said,

406
00:26:10.528 --> 00:26:12.070
and she shared his beliefs.

407
00:26:12.071 --> 00:26:14.490
Doctor, was it your impression
Emily placed her care

408
00:26:14.491 --> 00:26:15.907
entirely
in Father Moore's hands?

409
00:26:15.908 --> 00:26:17.867

JUDGE:
Sustained.

411
00:26:21.372 --> 00:26:23.957
After the end of October,
did you ask Emily

412
00:26:23.958 --> 00:26:26.960
why she had stopped filling
her Gambutrol prescriptions?

413
00:26:26.961 --> 00:26:28.295
Yes.

414
00:26:28.296 --> 00:26:30.630
She said that Father Moore
had suggested

415
00:26:30.631 --> 00:26:31.798
she stop taking the drug.

416
00:26:31.799 --> 00:26:33.342
And what,
in your medical opinion,

417
00:26:33.343 --> 00:26:35.927
was the direct result
of Father Moore's suggestion?

418
00:26:35.928 --> 00:26:38.388
I firmly believe Father Moore's
suggestion killed her.

419
00:26:38.389 --> 00:26:40.474
Objection, Your Honor.
The witness is asserting

420
00:26:40.475 --> 00:26:43.352
outrageous conclusions
based on pure hearsay evidence.

421
00:26:43.353 --> 00:26:45.103
Technically correct,

422
00:26:45.104 --> 00:26:48.857
but I'll allow it, as part of
his expert opinion testimony.

423
00:26:48.858 --> 00:26:50.567

425
00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:55.989
Doctor, you said you observed
a <i>possible</i> epileptic focus

426
00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:57.782
in the temporal lobe.

427
00:26:57.783 --> 00:26:59.576
Doesn't this imply
that what you observed

428
00:26:59.577 --> 00:27:01.161
may not have been
an epileptic focus?

429
00:27:01.162 --> 00:27:02.996
Yes, that's also possible.

430
00:27:02.997 --> 00:27:05.374
And would Father Moore's advice
to stop taking Gambutrol

431
00:27:05.375 --> 00:27:08.043
be good advice if Emily were,
in fact, not epileptic?

432
00:27:08.044 --> 00:27:09.627
Of course.

433
00:27:09.628 --> 00:27:11.838
But that's not the case here.
She was epileptic.

434
00:27:11.839 --> 00:27:14.424
Really?

435
00:27:14.425 --> 00:27:17.344
When Emily saw objects
move on their own,

436
00:27:17.345 --> 00:27:20.180
and felt an invisible
presence on top of her,

437
00:27:20.181 --> 00:27:22.891
was she experiencing symptoms
typical of epilepsy?

438
00:27:22.892 --> 00:27:24.393
Not typical, no.

439
00:27:24.394 --> 00:27:27.521
Are they typical indications
of any other conditions?

440
00:27:27.522 --> 00:27:28.813
Say, for example, psychosis?

441
00:27:28.814 --> 00:27:30.566
Yes, I would say that's correct.

442
00:27:30.567 --> 00:27:34.069
But isn't psychosis an entirely
different medical condition

443
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:35.111
from epilepsy?

444
00:27:35.112 --> 00:27:36.738
Yes, in my experience, it is.

445
00:27:36.739 --> 00:27:39.282
So, doctor, aren't you
selectively choosing what parts

446
00:27:39.283 --> 00:27:41.577
of Emily's experiences
fit your epilepsy diagnosis

447

which might indicate otherwise?

BRIGGS: I have advanced
degrees in medicine, psychiatry,

neurology from Johns Hopkins,

583
00:41:16.933 --> 00:41:21.062
And I have had three books
and several dozen papers

584
00:41:21.063 --> 00:41:23.356
published in the fields
of neurology

585
00:41:23.357 --> 00:41:24.982

586
00:41:24.983 --> 00:41:27.526
What was the cause of death,
as determined by the autopsy?

587
00:41:27.527 --> 00:41:30.654
The decedent expired
due to a gradual shutdown

588
00:41:30.655 --> 00:41:31.822
of the bodily functions.

589
00:41:31.823 --> 00:41:34.116
Why did her body shut down?

590
00:41:34.117 --> 00:41:37.286
The autopsy found that, uh,
it was a cumulative effect

591
00:41:37.287 --> 00:41:40.998
from numerous physical traumas
exacerbated by malnutrition,

592
00:41:40.999 --> 00:41:43.500
which severely inhibited
her ability

593
00:41:43.501 --> 00:41:45.878
to recuperate
from those traumas.

594
00:41:45.879 --> 00:41:47.463
Um, in other words,

595
00:41:47.464 --> 00:41:50.799
her starving body had
little or no means to recover

596
00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:52.468
from the injuries
it was sustaining,

597
00:41:52.469 --> 00:41:54.345
and so it eventually
just gave out.

598
00:41:54.346 --> 00:41:56.013
How did Emily
get these injuries?

599
00:41:56.014 --> 00:41:59.850
Some were the result of
violent epileptic seizures,

600
00:41:59.851 --> 00:42:02.270
and some were self-inflicted.

601
00:42:02.271 --> 00:42:04.605
And why, in your opinion,
did Emily injure herself?

602
00:42:04.606 --> 00:42:06.232
And why did she stop eating?

603
00:42:06.233 --> 00:42:09.610
Upon review of
her complete medical file,

604
00:42:09.611 --> 00:42:12.238
I concluded
that Emily's epilepsy

605
00:42:12.239 --> 00:42:14.115
had evolved into
a condition known as

606
00:42:14.116 --> 00:42:15.866
psychotic epileptic disorder.

607
00:42:15.867 --> 00:42:18.035
This is a rare development,
to be sure.

608
00:42:18.036 --> 00:42:20.496
But one that I have witnessed
numerous times.

609
00:42:20.497 --> 00:42:23.124
You mean that Emily was
both epileptic and psychotic?

610
00:42:23.125 --> 00:42:24.125
Yes.

611
00:42:24.126 --> 00:42:25.542
Please explain how this

612
00:42:25.543 --> 00:42:27.753
psychotic epileptic disorder
would manifest itself.

613
00:42:27.754 --> 00:42:29.255
The seizures would have

614
00:42:29.256 --> 00:42:31.006
<i>the characteristic symptoms
of schizophrenia</i>

615
00:42:31.007 --> 00:42:34.760
<i>such as auditory
and visual hallucinations</i>

616
00:42:34.761 --> 00:42:36.720
<i>and sometimes extreme paranoia.</i>

617
00:42:36.721 --> 00:42:38.473
<i>The seizures may lock up</i>

618
00:42:38.474 --> 00:42:40.891
<i>the joints
and slightly contort the body.</i>

619
00:42:40.892 --> 00:42:42.893
<i>The pupils will dilate,</i>

620
00:42:42.894 --> 00:42:44.853
<i>making the eyes appear black.</i>

621
00:42:44.854 --> 00:42:46.397
So you believe she had epilepsy,

622
00:42:46.398 --> 00:42:48.274
which developed
into a violent psychosis,

623
00:42:48.275 --> 00:42:49.733
a condition
that can be controlled

624
00:42:49.734 --> 00:42:51.486
with the drug Gambutrol?

625
00:42:51.487 --> 00:42:54.405
Yes. And it would've been if
she'd continued her treatment.

626
00:42:54.406 --> 00:42:55.697
Dr. Briggs,
in your opinion,

627
00:42:55.698 --> 00:42:57.533
if Emily continued
with her medication,

628
00:42:57.534 --> 00:42:58.659
would she be alive today?

629
00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:00.828
Absolutely.

630
00:43:00.829 --> 00:43:02.788
If treated early,

631
00:43:02.789 --> 00:43:06.625
psychotic epileptic disorder is
rarely fatal.

632
00:43:06.626 --> 00:43:08.336

634
00:43:11.298 --> 00:43:13.799

should have realized

635
00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:18.095
that Emily was in need
of continued medical treatment.

636
00:43:18.096 --> 00:43:19.305
Thank you, doctor.

00:43:19.306 --> 00:43:20.890

638
00:43:23.977 --> 00:43:25.811
Doctor, you testified
that Gambutrol

639
00:43:25.812 --> 00:43:27.771
could have controlled
Emily's condition.

640
00:43:27.772 --> 00:43:28.814
Mm-hmm.

641
00:43:28.815 --> 00:43:30.232
How do you know that?

642
00:43:30.233 --> 00:43:33.569
It's the inevitable result
of taking the drug.

643
00:43:33.570 --> 00:43:36.030
Gambutrol would have controlled
her epileptic seizures,

644
00:43:36.031 --> 00:43:38.533
which were the root cause
of her psychosis.

645
00:43:38.534 --> 00:43:41.035
But wasn't Emily still
experiencing psychotic symptoms

646
00:43:41.036 --> 00:43:43.204
even after she started
taking the medication?

647
00:43:43.205 --> 00:43:44.455
Yes.

648
00:43:44.456 --> 00:43:46.415
Because Gambutrol has
a cumulative effect.

649
00:43:46.416 --> 00:43:49.001
It... It takes time to build up
in the patient's system.

650
00:43:49.002 --> 00:43:51.462
So you assume that Gambutrol
would've helped her,

651
00:43:51.463 --> 00:43:52.588
but you don't know that.

652
00:43:52.589 --> 00:43:55.007
It's a reasonable assumption,
but...

653
00:43:55.008 --> 00:43:57.009
No, of course,
I can't be certain.

654
00:43:57.010 --> 00:43:58.802
Hm.

655
00:43:58.803 --> 00:44:04.266
Doctor, is psychotic epileptic
disorder a common medical term,

656
00:44:04.267 --> 00:44:05.851
or did you just make it up?

657

the illness...

my name is Erin Bruner,

and I represent the defendant,
Richard Moore.

747
00:47:57.834 --> 00:48:00.001
Mr. Thomas has contended

748
00:48:00.002 --> 00:48:04.089
that Emily Rose suffered from
a serious medical condition

749
00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:07.426
that required medical treatment,
nothing more.

750
00:48:07.427 --> 00:48:10.887
He has asserted
that any attempt by my client

751
00:48:10.888 --> 00:48:13.682
to help Emily by anything
other than medical means

752
00:48:13.683 --> 00:48:17.978
was not only inappropriate,
but criminally negligent.

753
00:48:17.979 --> 00:48:20.648
I'm now gonna ask

754
00:48:20.649 --> 00:48:22.483
that you keep an open mind

755
00:48:22.484 --> 00:48:25.861
to what our evidence
and testimony will show.

756
00:48:25.862 --> 00:48:28.405
Medical treatment was
not the answer for Emily,

757
00:48:28.406 --> 00:48:32.701
because she simply did not
suffer from a medical condition.

758
00:48:32.702 --> 00:48:37.791
She was neither epileptic,
nor psychotic.

759
00:48:40.001 --> 00:48:43.712
Emily Rose's condition, in fact,
was demonic possession.

760
00:48:43.713 --> 00:48:46.799
An exorcism was her only hope
for a cure.

920
00:58:00.644 --> 00:58:05.648
Yes. Possession is one term
for a basic human experience

921
00:58:05.649 --> 00:58:10.778
reported by a great number
of people all around the world.

922
00:58:10.779 --> 00:58:13.990
In my fieldwork,
I've seen many people

923
00:58:13.991 --> 00:58:17.160

a sense of being invaded

924

from the supernatural realm.

was invaded?

Why did this possession
happen to her?

927
00:58:24.585 --> 00:58:27.128
Based on my study
of the case file,

928
00:58:27.129 --> 00:58:31.341

was a hypersensitive.

"the separate reality."

different from everyone else.

uniquely susceptible

that is alien to them.

Dr. Adani...

959
00:59:50.963 --> 00:59:53.507
why do you think
Emily's exorcism failed?

960
00:59:53.508 --> 00:59:55.800
The medical treatment,

961
00:59:55.801 --> 00:59:58.845
specifically,
the drug, Gambutrol.

962
00:59:58.846 --> 01:00:00.472
Please explain.

963
01:00:00.473 --> 01:00:04.976
The exorcism ritual results
in a specific brain activity

964
01:00:04.977 --> 01:00:08.980
that cuts the person off
from the possession experience.

965
01:00:08.981 --> 01:00:14.235
But Emily's exorcism
could not have achieved this

966
01:00:14.236 --> 01:00:17.030
because the doctor
gave her Gambutrol,

967
01:00:17.031 --> 01:00:20.908
which has an intoxicating effect
on the brain.

968
01:00:20.909 --> 01:00:25.163
The drug made her immune
to the psycho-spiritual shock

969
01:00:25.164 --> 01:00:28.291
that exorcism
is intended to provide.

970
01:00:28.292 --> 01:00:30.710
What do you believe was
the ultimate result of treatment

971
01:00:30.711 --> 01:00:32.379
with this intoxicating drug?

972
01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:36.257
Gambutrol locked Emily
in the possessed state.

973
01:00:36.258 --> 01:00:39.844
This left her unable
to respond to the exorcism.

974
01:00:39.845 --> 01:00:44.433
And therefore, it directly
contributed to her death.

01:25:48.519 --> 01:25:53.356
I think it's a record
of certain... indications

1411
01:25:53.357 --> 01:25:55.358
that Emily was possessed, uh...

1412
01:25:55.359 --> 01:25:56.860
Signs of possession,
you may call them.

1413
01:25:56.861 --> 01:25:58.152
By "signs of possession"

1414
01:25:58.153 --> 01:26:00.572
would you mean
her speaking in languages

1415
01:26:00.573 --> 01:26:02.615
we might assume
she couldn't possibly know?

1416
01:26:02.616 --> 01:26:05.994
And the vocalization of two
distinct voices simultaneously?

1417
01:26:05.995 --> 01:26:08.204
Yes. Among other signs
that I observed

1418
01:26:08.205 --> 01:26:10.582
and described to the court
while the tape was playing.

1419
01:26:10.583 --> 01:26:12.834

really hear on the tape.

at your word on those, won't we?

Your Honor.
Mr. Thomas.

1422
01:26:17.297 --> 01:26:20.759
I apologize. Father,
as Emily's parish priest,

1423
01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:23.762
are you aware that she underwent
advanced catechism training?

1424
01:26:23.763 --> 01:26:25.097
Yes. Yes.
Her family is very devout.

1425
01:26:25.098 --> 01:26:26.514
And in that training,

1426
01:26:26.515 --> 01:26:28.391
did she study Ancient Greek,
Hebrew and Latin?

1427
01:26:28.392 --> 01:26:29.976
Yes, I think that's right.

1428
01:26:29.977 --> 01:26:32.478
She might have even spent
some time studying Aramaic,

1429
01:26:32.479 --> 01:26:34.230
the language of Christ
and his disciples,

1430
01:26:34.231 --> 01:26:35.941
which, according
to the transcripts,

1431
01:26:35.942 --> 01:26:37.776
we also heard
on the audiotape, correct?

1432
01:26:37.777 --> 01:26:39.193
She spoke Aramaic on the tape,

1433
01:26:39.194 --> 01:26:40.820
but I don't think
it was part of her training.

1434
01:26:40.821 --> 01:26:42.072
But it was offered

1435
01:26:42.073 --> 01:26:43.865
as an elective
at her catechism school.

1436
01:26:43.866 --> 01:26:46.492
I have the school's curriculum
here in my file if you'd like.

1437
01:26:46.493 --> 01:26:49.287
No, I... I'll accept
that she might have been

1438
01:26:49.288 --> 01:26:50.663
exposed to that language.

1439
01:26:50.664 --> 01:26:52.457
And according to
her high school records,

1440
01:26:52.458 --> 01:26:54.918
German was the foreign language
she studied there, yes?

1441
01:26:54.919 --> 01:26:56.544
I don't know.
If you say so.

1442
01:26:56.545 --> 01:26:59.005

all the strange languages

No.
Good. Now, Father,

1446
01:27:05.471 --> 01:27:07.889
we've already established
that you're no medical expert.

1447
01:27:07.890 --> 01:27:09.474
As you said,
that's not your field.

1448
01:27:09.475 --> 01:27:11.893
But are you aware
of the dual sets of vocal cords

1449
01:27:11.894 --> 01:27:13.311
that every human possesses?

1450
01:27:13.312 --> 01:27:14.854
No.
Have you heard

1451
01:27:14.855 --> 01:27:17.149
of the superior vocal cords
which are a bit higher

1452
01:27:17.150 --> 01:27:19.358
than the primary ones
we use to speak?

1453
01:27:19.359 --> 01:27:20.610
No.
No, so you didn't know

1454
01:27:20.611 --> 01:27:22.236
that Tibetan monks, for example,

1455
01:27:22.237 --> 01:27:23.905
as part of their
religious training

1456
01:27:23.906 --> 01:27:26.116
actually teach themselves
to activate

1457
01:27:26.117 --> 01:27:28.827
both sets of vocal cords
at once?

1458
01:27:28.828 --> 01:27:30.620
No, I-I didn't know that.

1459
01:27:30.621 --> 01:27:32.246
Well, now that you do know,

1460
01:27:32.247 --> 01:27:33.873
would you think
it's possible that Emily,

1461
01:27:33.874 --> 01:27:35.500
in her psychotic state,

1462
01:27:35.501 --> 01:27:37.961
might have activated both
of her sets of vocal cords,

1463
01:27:37.962 --> 01:27:39.796
so as to achieve
the... amazing effect

1464
01:27:39.797 --> 01:27:41.547
we heard captured
on your audiotape?

1465
01:27:41.548 --> 01:27:43.257
Her state was not psychotic.

1466
01:27:43.258 --> 01:27:45.760
Father Moore, you told us that
in the exorcism we just heard,

1467
01:27:45.761 --> 01:27:49.597
you actually saw, once again,
this black-robed figure

1468
01:27:49.598 --> 01:27:51.016
or demonic apparition,
am I right?

1469
01:27:51.017 --> 01:27:52.225
Yes.

1470
01:27:52.226 --> 01:27:53.852
But, of course,
we couldn't see him

1471
01:27:53.853 --> 01:27:55.394

correct?

1472
01:27:55.395 --> 01:27:56.938
No, of course not.
No, of course not.

1473

yet another supernatural aspect

doesn't prove, correct?

01:45:31.826 --> 01:45:33.451
as Dr. Adani suggests?

1755
01:45:33.452 --> 01:45:37.455
A person... who's more likely,
by her very nature,

1756
01:45:37.456 --> 01:45:40.458
to become possessed?

1757
01:45:40.459 --> 01:45:45.338
I can't say that,
but the question is...

1758
01:45:45.339 --> 01:45:46.549
is it possible?

1759
01:45:48.509 --> 01:45:52.596
Is it a fact that Gambutrol
anesthetized Emily's brain

1760
01:45:52.597 --> 01:45:56.309
so that the exorcism ritual
was rendered ineffective?

1761
01:45:58.186 --> 01:45:59.938
I can't be sure of that.

1762
01:46:02.565 --> 01:46:03.816
But is it possible?

1763
01:46:05.193 --> 01:46:09.488
Is it a fact that Emily
was beloved by God?

1764
01:46:11.449 --> 01:46:15.160
And that after her exorcism,
she chose to suffer till the end

1765
01:46:15.161 --> 01:46:18.330
so that we might believe in
a more magical world?

1766
01:46:18.331 --> 01:46:22.751
A world where the spiritual
realm really exists?

1767
01:46:22.752 --> 01:46:24.837
I can't say that's a fact.

1768
01:46:25.922 --> 01:46:28.466
But ask yourself:

1769
01:46:30.135 --> 01:46:31.510
Is it possible?

1770
01:46:32.929 --> 01:46:35.180
It's what Emily believed.

1771
01:46:35.181 --> 01:46:36.932
It's what Father Moore believed.

1772
01:46:36.933 --> 01:46:40.602
And that sincere belief
is what determined her choices

1773
01:46:40.603 --> 01:46:41.853
and his.

1774
01:46:41.854 --> 01:46:45.566
Now, for the most
important question:

1775
01:46:47.152 --> 01:46:49.903
Is Father Richard Moore guilty

1776
01:46:49.904 --> 01:46:54.158
beyond a reasonable doubt
of negligent homicide?

1777
01:46:54.159 --> 01:46:56.076
Did he, in fact,

1778
01:46:56.077 --> 01:46:59.246
neglect Emily's needs
in such a way

1779
01:46:59.247 --> 01:47:01.957
that her death
is now on his hands?

1780
01:47:01.958 --> 01:47:02.958
No!

1781
01:47:02.959 --> 01:47:06.128
That is not a fact.

1782
01:47:06.129 --> 01:47:09.298
It is not a fact
that Emily was epileptic.

1783
01:47:09.299 --> 01:47:13.510
It is not a fact
that she was psychotic.

1784
01:47:13.511 --> 01:47:15.762
Facts...

1785
01:47:15.763 --> 01:47:18.891

01:47:20.518 --> 01:47:22.060
The only fact,

1787
01:47:22.061 --> 01:47:27.440
the only thing I know
beyond a doubt in this case,

1788
01:47:27.441 --> 01:47:31.320
is that Father Moore loved Emily
with his whole heart.

1789
01:47:31.321 --> 01:47:34.739
He did everything
in his power to help her.

1790
01:47:34.740 --> 01:47:39.871

so we could hear her story.

is not one of them.

if it pleases the court,

at the start of trial
that if found guilty,

1809
01:49:12.380 --> 01:49:14.256
he would be sentenced
immediately.

Yes, I recall that.

1811
01:49:16.426 --> 01:49:18.385
Does the prosecution
have any objection

1812
01:49:18.386 --> 01:49:20.012

do you understand this sentence,

1816
01:49:30.273 --> 01:49:31.731
which has been found
against you?

1817
01:49:31.732 --> 01:49:33.108
Yes, Your Honor.

And do you understand
the gravity of this crime?

That you may, under the law,

1820
01:49:37.322 --> 01:49:40.198

of up to 10 years?

1821
01:49:40.199 --> 01:49:41.616
Yes, I do.

Are there any statements

1823
01:49:43.786 --> 01:49:45.620

1824

No, Your Honor.

Very well.
Excuse me, Your Honor...

1826
01:49:49.959 --> 01:49:52.043
but the jury would like
to make a recommendation

1827
01:49:52.044 --> 01:49:53.838
regarding the sentence.
Objection.

1828
01:49:54.839 --> 01:49:56.465
Sit down, counselor.

1829

It's only a recommendation,
and I would like to hear it.

We recommend a sentence
of time served.

I'll accept that.

01:50:21.491 --> 01:50:23.201
