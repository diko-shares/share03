1
00:01:12.323 --> 00:01:14.741
So, I'm here.

2
00:01:14.742 --> 00:01:18.911
- And, I do not see anything happening.
<i>- Right.</i>

3
00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:20.747
- <i>Right.</i>
- At all.

4
00:01:20.748 --> 00:01:21.831
<i>Look, I'm very sorry, sir.</i>

5
00:01:21.832 --> 00:01:25.043
Guess what I'm trying to understand is,
what is the reason for this delay exactly?

6
00:01:25.044 --> 00:01:27.253
<i>- Yeah. Mr. Plotkin, I'm so sorry.</i>
- Specifically.

7
00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:30.757
- <i>But it's just that when we set out...</i>
- Yeah, we closed in November.

8
00:01:30.758 --> 00:01:33.092
We had all the permit applications in
before the end of the year.

9
00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:34.844
<i>Right. Once we get
the final stamp of approval.</i>

10
00:01:34.845 --> 00:01:36.387
And we can't get the trucks here
a little early?

11
00:01:36.388 --> 00:01:38.264
- Just, you know, get 'em started.
- <i>Miami Beach ordinances...</i>

12
00:01:38.265 --> 00:01:39.682
- <i>won't let me do that.</i>
- Is anyone actually...

13
00:01:39.683 --> 00:01:41.768
- enforcing those regulations?
- <i>Look, Mr. Plotkin,</i>

14
00:01:41.769 --> 00:01:43.394
<i>I know that you're eager to move in. Okay.</i>

15
00:01:43.395 --> 00:01:45.104
- <i>Once we get the final stamp of approval.</i>
- No.

16
00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:46.564
- <i>You're gonna be the first...</i>
- One second.

17
00:01:46.565 --> 00:01:47.691
<i>Sure.</i>

18
00:01:48.192 --> 00:01:49.275
Hello?

19
00:01:50.861 --> 00:01:54.113
You see what's going on at GME?

20
00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:55.740
<i>There's more of these idiots?</i>

21
00:01:55.741 --> 00:01:58.701
<i>The short sellers, now they're getting
creamed by the little guy...</i>

22
00:01:58.702 --> 00:01:59.869
A lot more.

23
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.412
<i>They won't hold much longer.</i>

24
00:02:01.413 --> 00:02:02.539
Go away.

25
00:02:03.415 --> 00:02:05.667
Oh Gabe, honey, they're holding.

26
00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:08.836
<i>It just crossed a hundred.</i>

27
00:02:08.837 --> 00:02:11.172
<i>Gabe, where are you?</i>

28
00:02:11.173 --> 00:02:12.340
Fuck!

29
00:02:12.341 --> 00:02:14.133

I think we're having
some sort of miscommunication here.

55
00:03:09.106 --> 00:03:10.731
Because I'm not trying
to move into that house.

56
00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:13.443
I'm trying to tear that house down
so I can build a tennis court

57
00:03:13.444 --> 00:03:15.445
for me and my family to play
during the pandemic.

58
00:03:15.446 --> 00:03:16.946
- <i>I see.</i>
- I thought it would be very simple.

59
00:03:16.947 --> 00:03:18.906
Apparently, it isn't because
the pandemic is almost over

60
00:03:18.907 --> 00:03:20.533
- and there's no tennis court.
- <i>Okay, Mr. Plotkin.</i>

61
00:03:20.534 --> 00:03:21.951
Thank you for your time.

62

00:03:23.704 --> 00:03:26.540

Hi there, Ken, how are you?
Great to hear from you.

- What? What's wrong with a Heinie?

92
00:05:41.008 --> 00:05:42.508
Drinking it since we were 17!

93
00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:44.594
Hey, drink what you like. No judgment.

94
00:05:44.595 --> 00:05:46.262
Uh, you have a Hamm's?

95
00:05:46.263 --> 00:05:48.848
- I'll have one of those.
- The fuck did you just order?

96
00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:51.726
Oh, it's a nice one outta Milwaukee.
Good quality.

97
00:05:51.727 --> 00:05:54.604
- Fifty cents a can before markup.
- C'mon, Kitty. Forget about price.

98
00:05:54.605 --> 00:05:55.896
Get him a Heineken, thank you.

99
00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:57.356
- It's on me.
- Thanks, man.

100
00:05:57.357 --> 00:06:00.067
Thank you, that's nice.
I'll have a Hamm's.

101
00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:01.694
So a Heineken and a Hamm's?

102
00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:02.820

00:06:02.821 --> 00:06:04.030

How you been, man?

106
00:06:11.997 --> 00:06:14.123
The whole Sara thing.

107
00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:17.335
Oh, yeah. Okay, uh...

108
00:06:17.336 --> 00:06:18.795
Up and down.

109
00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:20.505
Yeah.

110
00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:23.799
- How's your asshole brother?
- Still an asshole.

111
00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.594
- Okay.
- Yeah.

112
00:06:26.178 --> 00:06:27.803
- Keeping busy at least?
- Uh...

113
00:06:27.804 --> 00:06:30.931
Got the day job at MassMutual.
Working on my portfolio.

114
00:06:30.932 --> 00:06:33.352
That's the last thing you should be
worrying about right now.

115
00:06:33.852 --> 00:06:35.811
Why? It's a... It's a good distraction.

116
00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:37.146
Lemme take that over for you.

117
00:06:37.147 --> 00:06:38.731
We got thousands of analysts at B of A

118
00:06:38.732 --> 00:06:41.192
- that do just this. C'mon, Kitty.
- All good, man. Thank you.

119
00:06:41.193 --> 00:06:42.735
You should be focused on your family
right now.

120
00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:44.236
Not fucking around with penny stocks.

121
00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:46.947
They're not all penny stocks.
GameStop isn't a penny stock.

122
00:06:46.948 --> 00:06:48.449
GameStop?

123
00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:49.909
- Dude...
- You used to love GameStop!

124
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:53.080
- Yeah, then I grew up.
- Well, I think it's undervalued.

125
00:06:53.664 --> 00:06:55.665
I just sold off a bunch of other shit
to double down.

126
00:06:55.666 --> 00:06:57.625
How much are we talking? A grand?

127
00:06:57.626 --> 00:06:58.751
- Fifty.
- Bucks?

128
00:06:58.752 --> 00:06:59.877
Grand.

129
00:06:59.878 --> 00:07:01.003
53 grand.

130
00:07:01.004 --> 00:07:02.964
Yeah.

131
00:07:07.594 --> 00:07:08.594
Kitty...

132
00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:12.598
- Man, you don't even own a house.
- It's got a ton of short interest,

133
00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:14.433
- You got a one-year-old.
- Which is artificially pushing...

134
00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:15.851
- Jesus, bro.
- The price down.

135
00:07:15.852 --> 00:07:18.312
- You never bet against Wall Street!
- Wall Street gets it wrong all the time.

136
00:07:18.313 --> 00:07:19.855
- Look at '08.
- That was a one-off, Kitty.

137
00:07:19.856 --> 00:07:21.315
These guys, they have all the money

138
00:07:21.316 --> 00:07:23.442
and the fancy degrees
and the political juice in the world,

139
00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:25.653
- and they get it wrong all the time.
- Are you out of your fucking mind?

140
00:07:25.654 --> 00:07:28.448
They've got the advantage,
and they still get it wrong.

141
00:07:30.075 --> 00:07:32.618
No, gimme that, I'm drinking it.
Even if it's 50 cents.

142
00:07:32.619 --> 00:07:33.703
It's 4 bucks.

143
00:07:33.704 --> 00:07:35.788
Well, my man just spent 53K
on a penny stock.

144
00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:37.665
So, all he can afford is water.

145
00:07:37.666 --> 00:07:40.167
- You're a Wall Street guy?
- Very much no.

146
00:07:40.168 --> 00:07:41.711
I'm a Wall Street guy.

147
00:07:41.712 --> 00:07:43.213
What was the stock?

148
00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:45.549
GameStop.

149
00:07:46.925 --> 00:07:48.259
The video game store. At the mall.

150
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.846
- You really bought $53,000 of it?
- Yeah, I don't believe it.

151
00:07:51.847 --> 00:07:54.014
I think he's fucking with us.
You're fucking with us, right?

152
00:07:54.015 --> 00:07:55.725
You don't even have 50 grand.

153
00:07:55.726 --> 00:07:56.893
Let's see.

154
00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:00.439
Oh, shit.

155
00:08:02.524 --> 00:08:04.442
How is she falling for this?
How are you falling for this?

156
00:08:04.443 --> 00:08:06.819
He won't spend 5 bucks for a beer,

157
00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:10.239
but he'll put 50k in a stock
that you think is a joke.

158
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.825
And that's interesting to you?

159
00:08:12.701 --> 00:08:13.785
Yeah.

160
00:08:14.995 --> 00:08:16.121
It is.

161
00:08:22.085 --> 00:08:23.669
Drink your shitty beer.

162
00:08:33.054 --> 00:08:34.096
Hey!

163
00:08:34.097 --> 00:08:35.223
Hey!

164
00:08:37.642 --> 00:08:39.185
Bedtime's already done?

165
00:08:39.186 --> 00:08:42.564
Yeah, she was exhausted.
She skipped her nap.

166
00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:45.900
- How was Briggsy?
- Uh...

167
00:08:45.901 --> 00:08:47.360
Good. Yeah.

168
00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.412
You guys talk about Sara?

169
00:08:59.331 --> 00:09:00.331
Uh...

170
00:09:03.835 --> 00:09:05.503
Do you wanna sit down a minute?

171
00:09:05.504 --> 00:09:07.671
I'll feel better if I finish these first.

172
00:09:08.633 --> 00:09:10.884
No, you won't.

173
00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:37.284
Do you think I'm insane?

174
00:09:37.285 --> 00:09:38.620
Yeah.

175
00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:41.540
Sorry. About what?

176
00:09:42.707 --> 00:09:43.833
GameStop.

177
00:09:43.834 --> 00:09:46.586
The most compelling
asymmetric opportunity in the market?

178
00:09:48.713 --> 00:09:51.006
- What, did Briggsy make you jumpy?
- A little.

179
00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:53.133
- What was his argument?
- He didn't have one.

180
00:09:53.134 --> 00:09:55.719
- Well.
- He just said it was a reckless bet.

181
00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.097
He said "you're putting your money
in the next Blockbuster."

182
00:09:58.098 --> 00:09:59.015
Enough. Fuck Briggsy.

183
00:09:59.016 --> 00:10:02.394
Babe, you literally know more about
this damn company than you know about me.

184
00:10:02.853 --> 00:10:03.770
It's true.

185
00:10:03.771 --> 00:10:06.772
And because of you, I know more about
this company than I know about myself.

186
00:10:06.773 --> 00:10:10.569
But what if I'm missing something?
We can't afford to miss something.

187
00:10:11.903 --> 00:10:13.655
It's all our savings.

188
00:10:14.364 --> 00:10:15.532
Go do a video.

189
00:10:16.825 --> 00:10:18.659
I can finish these first. I'm happy to...

190
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.786
Go see what the nerds have to say.

191
00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:23.455
Our Wall Street Bets people
aren't nerds, Caroline.

192
00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:25.958
They're gangsters.
You make a dumb case and post it,

193
00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:28.378
- they'll rip you apart.
- Well, then don't make a dumb case.

194
00:10:47.522 --> 00:10:49.024
Okay, let's see what's new.

195
00:10:51.985 --> 00:10:54.029
Oh, there's a share. Okay, here we go.

196
00:10:56.948 --> 00:10:58.241
Oh shit.

197
00:11:21.598 --> 00:11:23.058
All right...

198
00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.436
Just check on... See here.

199
00:11:36.738 --> 00:11:39.490
Yo, what up, everybody?
Roaring Kitty here.

200
00:11:39.491 --> 00:11:42.618
Uh, I've done a few of these now,
mostly on my investing methodology.

201
00:11:42.619 --> 00:11:45.454
Uh, but today I'm gonna try something
a little different.

202
00:11:45.455 --> 00:11:48.874
I appreciate the feedback
you guys have been leaving me by the way.

203
00:11:48.875 --> 00:11:52.544
Uh... Oh! More feedback comin' in hot.

204
00:11:52.545 --> 00:11:56.340
"Less cats." Okay. Great.

205
00:11:56.341 --> 00:11:59.969
Ah, like I was saying...
Uh, what was I saying?

206
00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:00.929
Ah, I'm gonna try...

207
00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:03.138
Oh, and here's one from Ballz.

208
00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:04.640
"Nerd."

209
00:12:04.641 --> 00:12:06.642
And nerd is in all capitals.

210
00:12:06.643 --> 00:12:10.688
Like, okay, that's kinda mean.
But okay, fair.

211
00:12:10.689 --> 00:12:11.772
Uh...

212
00:12:11.773 --> 00:12:13.774
"Nice shirt, Grandpa"?

213
00:12:13.775 --> 00:12:17.069
What? How old do you think I am?

214
00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:18.029
You know what?

215
00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:21.156
Thanks for the comments.
We're gonna come back to them at the end.

216
00:12:21.157 --> 00:12:22.450
Here's what I wanna talk about.

217
00:12:23.326 --> 00:12:26.578
Uh, I'm gonna pick a stock and
talk about why I think it's interesting.

218
00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:28.540
And that stock is...

219
00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.960
GameStop. Uh...

220
00:12:32.752 --> 00:12:34.128
I know it's a polarizing stock

221
00:12:34.129 --> 00:12:36.630
and some of you probably gonna
tune out of the stream right now

222
00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:39.133
when you hear I'm bullish on GameStop.
But I am.

223
00:12:39.134 --> 00:12:43.220
You can see it is now the biggest position
by far in the Roaring Kitty portfolio.

224
00:12:43.221 --> 00:12:44.139
So...

225
00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:47.182
yeah, I think everyone else is crazy,
and I think I'm right.

226
00:12:47.183 --> 00:12:51.729
But I've been wrong plenty of times
in the past. So, uh...

227
00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:55.274
<i>So there are a lot of aspects to this
bold thesis, a lot of moving parts,</i>

228
00:12:55.275 --> 00:12:57.776
<i>but I boil it down
to what I consider the three overs:</i>

229
00:12:57.777 --> 00:13:00.112
The digital risks seem to me
to be overblown,

230
00:13:00.113 --> 00:13:01.572
the negative sentiment is overdone,

231
00:13:01.573 --> 00:13:03.323
you can see it
with the huge short interest,

232
00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:05.242
and the value is overlooked.

233
00:13:05.243 --> 00:13:07.412
Wall Street just doesn't see it.

234
00:13:08.038 --> 00:13:09.204
Why?

235
00:13:09.205 --> 00:13:12.459
Mr. Market, why?

236
00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:15.961
<i>The hedge funds are overlooking
the value in the company</i>

237
00:13:15.962 --> 00:13:18.672
<i>just like they overlook
the people who shop there.</i>

238
00:13:18.673 --> 00:13:21.383
<i>They assume most people download
games online now.</i>

239
00:13:21.384 --> 00:13:25.721
<i>But look, 25% of gamers
still buy new discs from GameStop,</i>

240
00:13:25.722 --> 00:13:28.766
<i>and 40% buy used games from the store.</i>

241
00:13:28.767 --> 00:13:30.726
<i>And the market's kinda forced
my hand here.</i>

242
00:13:30.727 --> 00:13:33.687
<i>What more can I say?
I just like the stock.</i>

243
00:13:33.688 --> 00:13:34.773
Hey!

244
00:13:35.482 --> 00:13:36.900
Shit!

245
00:13:37.942 --> 00:13:39.610
- Did I wake you?
- Please stop.

246
00:13:39.611 --> 00:13:42.488
Mr. Donaldson, I need you in your bed.

247
00:13:42.489 --> 00:13:44.490
Kerin, can you please
make sure Mr. Donaldson...

248
00:13:44.491 --> 00:13:46.950
I don't need to go to bed.
I need a cup of coffee.

249
00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:49.828
We can get you a cup of coffee.
Kerin, coffee.

250
00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:50.997
Oh!

251
00:13:51.623 --> 00:13:52.791
Well, isn't that beautiful?

252
00:13:53.374 --> 00:13:54.500
Oh shit.

253
00:13:55.835 --> 00:14:00.714
"100% short GameStop stock"?

254
00:14:00.715 --> 00:14:02.091
It's an investment video.

255
00:14:02.092 --> 00:14:04.676
Hey, Jenny, for real,

256
00:14:04.677 --> 00:14:07.513
I wouldn't take investment advice
from a guy in a cat shirt.

257
00:14:07.514 --> 00:14:10.140
Oh, okay.
Who do you take investment advice from?

258
00:14:10.141 --> 00:14:16.814
I don't have investments. And if I did,
I'd listen to, like, a banker.

259
00:14:16.815 --> 00:14:18.315
Just the way they like it.

260
00:14:18.316 --> 00:14:22.277
"They." Oh boy. Here we go...

261
00:14:22.278 --> 00:14:23.445
Just never mind.

262
00:14:23.446 --> 00:14:24.905
No, no, no, please tell me.

263
00:14:24.906 --> 00:14:28.117
I'm dying to know what Luke Wilson
from <i>The Royal Tenenbaums</i>

264
00:14:28.118 --> 00:14:30.744
thinks we should do
with our $68,000 a year.

265
00:14:30.745 --> 00:14:31.870
Who from what?

266
00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:32.955
Ugly Björn Borg.

267
00:14:32.956 --> 00:14:34.123
Okay, fine.

268
00:14:34.124 --> 00:14:37.042
Wall Street is betting
that this company is gonna fail.

269
00:14:37.043 --> 00:14:38.627
It's called shorting.

270
00:14:38.628 --> 00:14:42.214
And if it fails, well,
then everybody loses their job,

271
00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:44.884
but these hedge fund assholes
make a shit ton of money.

272
00:14:45.468 --> 00:14:49.221
It's bullshit. It's a bullshit way
for rich people to get richer.

273
00:14:49.222 --> 00:14:50.889
How did you even find this guy?

274
00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:53.517
70,000 people have watched this video.

275
00:14:53.518 --> 00:14:55.936
He posts his balance sheets
and everything.

276
00:14:55.937 --> 00:14:57.771
Wall Street Bets is going crazy over this.

277
00:14:57.772 --> 00:14:59.898
- Who?
- It's an Internet forum.

278
00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:00.984
Uh-huh.

279
00:15:01.776 --> 00:15:03.026
- On Reddit.
- Now, see. No, no.

280
00:15:03.027 --> 00:15:05.404
I'm not gonna do this with you.
The last time you brought up Reddit,

281
00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:08.157
it was just all these oil paintings
of Donald Trump on horseback.

282
00:15:08.158 --> 00:15:09.950
- You liked it.
- Detestable.

283
00:15:09.951 --> 00:15:12.619
- Look.
- Okay, yeah. Let's take a look.

284
00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:14.204
Um...

285
00:15:14.205 --> 00:15:16.665
"Shit's not a pump-and-dump

286
00:15:16.666 --> 00:15:20.043
if it never dumps, you fuckheads..."

287
00:15:20.044 --> 00:15:24.173
"Feed me your tears,
I use it as anal lube on your wives."

288
00:15:24.174 --> 00:15:25.299
Why did you go to that one?

289
00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:28.844
Oh! Oh! Oh! "Strap on ur theta dildo"

290
00:15:28.845 --> 00:15:32.973
- "n start pounding."
- Okay. Yes, that shit exists on here.

291
00:15:32.974 --> 00:15:36.768
But I also learned the difference between
a delta squeeze and a gamma squeeze.

292
00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:38.770
And now everyone
is talking about call options.

293
00:15:38.771 --> 00:15:42.316
Jenny, baby,
you're never gonna find a man on there.

294
00:15:43.735 --> 00:15:45.986
And you're never gonna date Puff Daddy.

295
00:15:45.987 --> 00:15:48.405
First of all, no one has said Puff Daddy
since the '90s

296
00:15:48.406 --> 00:15:50.783
and second of all, this isn't Puff Daddy.

297
00:15:51.576 --> 00:15:52.744
This is Loop Daddy.

298
00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:57.539
Okay, well, whatever Daddy he's called,
he's weird looking.

299
00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:00.292
Hey, well, my guy has, what,
5 million TikTok followers.

300
00:16:00.293 --> 00:16:02.044
- How many does yours have?
- I don't know.

301
00:16:02.045 --> 00:16:04.796
Quick scroll. 412.

302
00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:07.132
- Who cares?
- The Internet at large.

303
00:16:07.133 --> 00:16:09.177
But hey. Least I aim high.

304
00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.096

319
00:17:06.651 --> 00:17:09.612
Shit... Yo, what's... Hey, Brad.

320
00:17:16.828 --> 00:17:20.665
Yo, um, I was wondering
if could I get an advance on my pay?

321
00:17:21.291 --> 00:17:22.791
I can run it up the chain,

322
00:17:22.792 --> 00:17:25.253
but with all the cutbacks,
that's unlikely.

323
00:17:26.337 --> 00:17:28.463
Oh, hey! You could do
the employee TikTok contest.

Yeah, man, totally.

326
00:17:33.344 --> 00:17:36.306
That's dope. I was thinkin' "Savage."

327
00:17:37.682 --> 00:17:39.641
Yeah. Yeah, sure, I love it.

328
00:17:39.642 --> 00:17:42.103
Or yo, that Drake one with Lil Durk.

329
00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:44.938
That's a great one too.

330
00:17:44.939 --> 00:17:46.733

00:17:47.275 --> 00:17:48.192
C'mon.

00:17:48.193 --> 00:17:50.819

by shorting the stock even more.</i>

507
00:25:55.721 --> 00:25:59.808
<i>This is our call to activate
diamond hands, my fellow warriors.</i>

508
00:25:59.809 --> 00:26:04.813
<i>We will not let the gay bears defeat us.
We are on a mission to the fucking moon.</i>

509
00:26:04.814 --> 00:26:07.857
<i>This is one that is bigger
than your personal gains.</i>

510
00:26:07.858 --> 00:26:10.485
<i>More than just ten dies for a new Lambo.</i>

511
00:26:10.486 --> 00:26:14.656
<i>This is our chance to rise up together.
To stick it to the big man.</i>

512
00:26:14.657 --> 00:26:16.908
<i>Squeezing Melvin by the fucking balls</i>

513
00:26:16.909 --> 00:26:19.829
<i>with the collective power
of diamond handing autists.</i>

514
00:26:20.412 --> 00:26:23.832
<i>Wall Street Bets I thought were a bunch
of idiots just throwing money at a stock</i>

515
00:26:23.833 --> 00:26:25.542
<i>because they thought it was funny</i>.

516
00:26:25.543 --> 00:26:26.876
<i>I was wrong.</i>

517
00:26:26.877 --> 00:26:29.420
<i>Now I see what Wall Street Bets really is.</i>

518
00:26:29.421 --> 00:26:32.465
<i>- It is a revolution.
- This is one of those rare moments</i>

519
00:26:32.466 --> 00:26:34.592
<i>where Wall Street are the ones
getting screwed over.</i>

520
00:26:34.593 --> 00:26:36.302
<i>And when we decide we're hungry,</i>

521
00:26:36.303 --> 00:26:38.763
<i>there is very little
the rich can do to stop us</i>

522
00:26:38.764 --> 00:26:40.932
<i>- from beating them.
- It's a GameStop to stop the game.</i>

523
00:26:40.933 --> 00:26:43.101
<i>- Power to the people.
- I'm jerking off right now.</i>

524
00:26:43.102 --> 00:26:44.143
<i>Jerking off right now.</i>

525
00:26:44.144 --> 00:26:46.771
<i>So welcome aboard, grab your peanuts,</i>

526
00:26:46.772 --> 00:26:48.731
<i>and get the fuck in, retard.</i>

527
00:26:48.732 --> 00:26:50.900
Ho, ho, ho!

528
00:26:50.901 --> 00:26:56.322
What up, everybody? Merry Christmas,
Happy New Year's, happy holidays. Uh...

529
00:26:56.323 --> 00:26:58.741
2020... See ya.

530
00:26:58.742 --> 00:27:01.870
2020 has been a very rough year
for my family too.

531
00:27:01.871 --> 00:27:04.956
So this GameStop news
has been a bit of a bright spot.

532
00:27:04.957 --> 00:27:07.542
Uh, look at this, I mean, where it's at.

533
00:27:07.543 --> 00:27:11.254
It's a five bagger
from where it was over the summer.

534
00:27:11.255 --> 00:27:15.258
You don't often see a thesis
play out like this.

535
00:27:15.259 --> 00:27:16.342
So we gotta...

536
00:27:16.343 --> 00:27:18.971
We can't take it for granted, right?
We gotta appreciate it.

537
00:27:19.889 --> 00:27:22.308
<i>Thank you, Santa. Right.</i>

538
00:27:23.058 --> 00:27:26.853
<i>Uh, I wanted to say cheers all of you.</i>

539
00:27:26.854 --> 00:27:29.106
You're why I'm here in the first place.

540
00:27:29.773 --> 00:27:32.859
Uh, it's fun to talk about.
I mean, I figure,

541
00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:35.445
if I worked at a hedge fund,
I'd compare notes with my colleagues.

542
00:27:35.446 --> 00:27:38.031
<i>But I don't.
I'm stuck at home like you guys. So...</i>

543
00:27:38.032 --> 00:27:40.408
<i>Uh, I believe in this stock.</i>

544
00:27:40.409 --> 00:27:42.745
<i>And I believe in this community.</i>

545
00:27:43.412 --> 00:27:44.621
<i>Um...</i>

546
00:27:44.622 --> 00:27:49.501
<i>I'll be honest, uh,
it's been kind of a shitty year.</i>

547
00:27:50.753 --> 00:27:55.506
<i>Uh, for a lot of people. Lotta people
lost people the past 12 months. I did too.</i>

548
00:27:55.507 --> 00:27:57.759
Uh, my sister, Sara.

549
00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:58.843
Uh...

550
00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:08.687
I don't talk about it much.

551
00:28:10.481 --> 00:28:12.440
<i>But it felt right to tell you.</i>

552
00:28:12.441 --> 00:28:14.776
<i>Uh, we've been through so much together.</i>

553
00:28:14.777 --> 00:28:17.905
<i>You've made me feel a part of something,
something big.</i>

554
00:28:18.864 --> 00:28:21.700
<i>So, uh, Merry Christmas. Cheers.</i>

555
00:28:55.567 --> 00:28:56.694
I like your car.

556
00:28:59.196 --> 00:29:00.405
It's a classic.

557
00:29:00.406 --> 00:29:02.073
- '95.
- Yes!

558
00:29:02.074 --> 00:29:03.950
Sadly, it's a gas-guzzler.

559
00:29:03.951 --> 00:29:06.453
Yeah, yup, this one too.

560
00:29:07.413 --> 00:29:11.457
But she's such a beauty
I couldn't stand to trade her.

561
00:29:11.458 --> 00:29:13.126
'96 Honda Accord?

562
00:29:13.127 --> 00:29:16.547
Uh, 2003. Not quite a classic.

563
00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:29.017
It's kinda weird to talk to someone
and see their whole face. Right?

564
00:29:29.018 --> 00:29:30.561
It's been so long.

565
00:29:31.395 --> 00:29:35.148
I... I work at a hospital,
you could probably tell.

566
00:29:35.149 --> 00:29:36.400
Essential worker.

567
00:29:36.984 --> 00:29:38.401
Thank you for everything you do.

568
00:29:38.402 --> 00:29:39.695
Oh, you're very welcome.

569
00:29:51.165 --> 00:29:52.583
Hey, uh...

570
00:29:53.709 --> 00:29:55.127
Have a good night.

571
00:29:56.045 --> 00:29:57.171
Cool.

572
00:29:57.963 --> 00:29:59.465
Safe travels.

573
00:30:16.148 --> 00:30:18.316
<i>Remember when
you were just making fun of me</i>

574
00:30:18.317 --> 00:30:21.736
- and now you're literally obsessed.
- No, I don't recall.

575
00:30:21.737 --> 00:30:24.697
- How much are you up?
- 948.

576
00:30:24.698 --> 00:30:27.909
Stock dipped a little,
it was like 2,000 before Christmas.

577
00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:29.536
Maybe you should sell.

578
00:30:31.705 --> 00:30:33.831
No. It's not about the money.

579
00:30:33.832 --> 00:30:35.833
The stock market is not about the money?

580
00:30:35.834 --> 00:30:38.420
No. You just gotta read
some of the stuff on here.

581
00:30:39.004 --> 00:30:42.715
Never understood why my dad
was so pissed off about this whole thing,

582
00:30:42.716 --> 00:30:43.842
but now I do.

583
00:30:45.427 --> 00:30:46.928
I told you about his store, right?

584
00:30:46.929 --> 00:30:48.388
Costco?

585
00:30:49.056 --> 00:30:50.556
Shopko.

586
00:30:50.557 --> 00:30:52.226
It was like, this like...

587
00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:54.853
big chain in our area.

588
00:30:55.687 --> 00:30:59.566
My dad, he worked his way all the way up
from bag boy to general manager.

589
00:31:00.317 --> 00:31:03.027
Then one of these Wall Street funds
came in, bought it,

590
00:31:03.028 --> 00:31:07.490
and vampire-sucked all the money out of it
and then declared bankruptcy.

591
00:31:07.491 --> 00:31:08.659
Fuck.

592
00:31:09.785 --> 00:31:10.869
Yeah.

593
00:31:12.579 --> 00:31:15.624
He lost his pension. Everything.

594
00:31:16.959 --> 00:31:19.836
It's why he had to work at
Pick 'n fuckin' Save till the day he died.

595
00:31:19.837 --> 00:31:22.297
And now that's why
I'm up to my ass in debt.

596
00:31:23.632 --> 00:31:26.301
And these fuckers are trying to do
the same thing to GameStop.

597
00:31:27.761 --> 00:31:28.929
Fuck 'em.

598
00:31:30.556 --> 00:31:31.890
Fuck 'em all.

599
00:31:53.537 --> 00:31:55.413
- Wait, look.
- Hm?

600
00:31:55.414 --> 00:31:56.831
Look at this.

601
00:31:56.832 --> 00:31:59.709
- This guy wants to CashApp me $100
- Shut the fuck up.

602
00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:03.754
To send him a selfie. Or 500
if I live chat him from a bubble bath.

603
00:32:03.755 --> 00:32:05.673
Yes! Yes, we should do it.

604
00:32:05.674 --> 00:32:07.884
- What?
- Yes, we do it.

605
00:32:07.885 --> 00:32:10.345
And then put the money into GameStop.

606
00:32:10.888 --> 00:32:14.640
- Who am I talking to right now?
- C'mon, bitch, let's go get a tub.

607
00:32:16.351 --> 00:32:18.811
<i>♪ We got this motherfucker lit

00:32:27.029 --> 00:32:28.362
<i>♪ Unh, please don't pretend... ♪</i>

612
00:32:28.363 --> 00:32:29.530
Your entire business

613
00:32:29.531 --> 00:32:31.657
is kids spending their lunch money
on random stocks.

614
00:32:31.658 --> 00:32:33.492
They come to you because it's free.

615
00:32:33.493 --> 00:32:37.580
But if you don't charge a commission
on their trades,

616
00:32:37.581 --> 00:32:39.498
how do you make money?

617
00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:46.130
The idea for Robinhood really came out
of the Occupy Wall Street movement.

618
00:32:46.131 --> 00:32:47.840
All those people
with no way of getting in.

619
00:32:47.841 --> 00:32:50.176
Is that what Occupy was about?

620
00:32:50.177 --> 00:32:52.970
I mean, were they trying to get in or...

621
00:32:52.971 --> 00:32:55.181
So we said, it's not enough to occupy.

622
00:32:55.182 --> 00:32:58.142
- We need to democratize Wall Street.
- Nat, I'm not sure you know this,

623
00:32:58.143 --> 00:32:59.644
but Baiju and I are both immigrants.

624
00:32:59.645 --> 00:33:01.437
I was born in Bulgaria,

625
00:33:01.438 --> 00:33:04.107
and Baiju's parents immigrated from India
to the Deep South.

626
00:33:04.983 --> 00:33:08.653
Can you imagine growing up
in rural Virginia with a name like

627
00:33:08.654 --> 00:33:11.697
Baiju Prafulkumar Bhatt?

628
00:33:11.698 --> 00:33:15.034
We created commission-free trading
so that anyone can get in the game.

629
00:33:15.035 --> 00:33:18.579
You don't even need a bank account.
People have really responded.

630
00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:22.541
We've added 5 million users,
uh, in the last six months,

631
00:33:22.542 --> 00:33:25.378
- for a total of, um...
- Close to 20 at this point. Million.

632
00:33:25.379 --> 00:33:27.213
So, you're one of these tech companies

633
00:33:27.214 --> 00:33:29.548
that's exploded growth-wise,
but doesn't make any money.

634
00:33:29.549 --> 00:33:31.384
- We make money.
- But how?

635
00:33:31.385 --> 00:33:34.387
- If you don't charge commission then...
- From interest on people's accounts.

636
00:33:34.388 --> 00:33:35.972
But your users are mostly young.

637
00:33:35.973 --> 00:33:38.766
So, how much money can they
really be keeping in their account?

638
00:33:38.767 --> 00:33:40.393
There's also payment for order flow.

639
00:33:40.394 --> 00:33:41.311
What's that?

640
00:33:41.312 --> 00:33:44.188
We prefer the term "stock order routing."

641
00:33:44.189 --> 00:33:46.148
When you buy or sell a stock on our app,

642
00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:48.943
we send your order to market makers,
who process the order.

643
00:33:48.944 --> 00:33:51.320
They pay us a tiny rebate on every trade.

644
00:33:51.321 --> 00:33:53.114
- Tiny.
- But it adds up.

645
00:33:53.115 --> 00:33:55.449
We should really get back to how we...
started our company.

646
00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:56.951
What market maker do you work with?

647
00:33:56.952 --> 00:33:59.245
A few. Citadel Securities mostly.

648
00:33:59.246 --> 00:34:01.622
Ken Griffin's firm?
Isn't that a hedge fund?

649
00:34:01.623 --> 00:34:05.209
Well, Ken Griffin's hedge fund
is called Citadel.

650
00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:07.878
But Citadel Securities
is a completely different company.

651
00:34:07.879 --> 00:34:09.673
Also owned by Ken Griffin?

652
00:34:11.091 --> 00:34:12.175
All right,

653
00:34:12.843 --> 00:34:15.512
we weren't gonna do this,
but we'll give you a scoop.

654
00:34:16.179 --> 00:34:18.015
Off the record for now.

655
00:34:18.682 --> 00:34:19.725
Okay.

656
00:34:21.059 --> 00:34:22.978
We're looking to IPO soon.

657
00:34:24.855 --> 00:34:27.357
Damn. Okay.

I don't need to concentrate.

681
00:35:21.286 --> 00:35:23.704
Fine. I need to concentrate.

682
00:35:23.705 --> 00:35:25.956
What do you need to concentrate about?

683
00:35:25.957 --> 00:35:27.124
What?

684
00:35:27.125 --> 00:35:29.335
I thought they were veering over
into our lane.

685
00:35:29.336 --> 00:35:31.922
Nobody was veering, Elaine.
It's okay.

686
00:35:35.884 --> 00:35:37.927
You talk to any of the girls
at the clinic?

687
00:35:37.928 --> 00:35:39.638
A few of them have called.

688
00:35:42.933 --> 00:35:44.350
I miss it.

689
00:35:44.351 --> 00:35:46.186
Boys, never retire.

690
00:35:46.853 --> 00:35:48.522
Keith, never retire.

691
00:35:49.189 --> 00:35:51.190
Kevin, if you ever get a job,
never retire.

692
00:35:51.191 --> 00:35:52.274
I have a job!

693
00:35:52.275 --> 00:35:54.568
Yet you still live with Ma and Dad.

694
00:35:54.569 --> 00:35:58.197
Oh, you're some big professional now
cuz you're fucking king dork on YouTube?

695
00:35:58.198 --> 00:35:59.532
Just one of many dorks.

696
00:35:59.533 --> 00:36:01.867
This asshole
thinks he's Jimmy Buffett now.

697
00:36:01.868 --> 00:36:03.452
- C'mon.
- Warren Buffett.

698
00:36:03.453 --> 00:36:05.496
- Warren Buffett.
- See?

699
00:36:05.497 --> 00:36:08.500
You're not either of the Buffetts, Kitty!

700
00:36:11.753 --> 00:36:13.004
You're Ballz?

701
00:36:16.299 --> 00:36:18.008
- Hey!
- Ah, good Christ.

702
00:36:18.009 --> 00:36:18.927
- Fellas.
- Ma.

703
00:36:18.928 --> 00:36:21.388
Drop! Stop it!

704
00:36:25.851 --> 00:36:27.018
Door Dash is not a job.

705
00:36:28.186 --> 00:36:29.228
MassMutual's a job.

706
00:36:29.229 --> 00:36:31.480
- A job's got business cards.
- Door Dash is a job.

707
00:36:31.481 --> 00:36:32.773
Okay, I'm a first responder.

708
00:36:32.774 --> 00:36:35.569
And second of all, Ma,
nobody uses business cards anymore.

709
00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:39.239
We're proud of you, honey.

710
00:36:40.282 --> 00:36:41.532
Get a room.

711
00:37:01.428 --> 00:37:04.431
Take your time. I'll be in the car.

712
00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:17.944
Yeah.

713
00:37:26.536 --> 00:37:27.829
Love you.

714
00:37:51.895 --> 00:37:53.479
<i>It has been dragging on.</i>

715
00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:55.773
<i>Honestly, I don't know
when we'll be able to start demo</i>

716
00:37:55.774 --> 00:37:57.608
<i>because local ordinances are a nightmare.</i>

717
00:37:57.609 --> 00:38:00.861
<i>My heart bleeds for you.
Having to borrow a tennis court.</i>

718
00:38:00.862 --> 00:38:02.655
"Borrower is slave to the lender."

719
00:38:02.656 --> 00:38:03.697
Is that Buffett?

720
00:38:03.698 --> 00:38:06.909
It's the Bible. Uh, Proverbs.
My Grandpa Melvin used to say it.

721
00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:08.619
When he was starting
his convenience store,

722
00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:09.954
he refused to borrow one dollar.

723
00:38:09.955 --> 00:38:10.996
It was a point of pride.

724
00:38:10.997 --> 00:38:12.790
Ah, yes, your humble beginnings.

725
00:38:12.791 --> 00:38:16.920
"Grandpa Melvin" Capital,
now with 16 billion under management.

726
00:38:17.504 --> 00:38:20.172
Better than "Citadel."
You sound like you're preparing for war.

727
00:38:20.173 --> 00:38:21.298
I'm a man of the people.

728
00:38:21.299 --> 00:38:22.508
You rented out a resort,

729
00:38:22.509 --> 00:38:25.928
and relocated your entire firm here
so you could stay open during lockdown.

730
00:38:25.929 --> 00:38:29.181
Says the man who flew his whole firm
down private just for a party.

731
00:38:29.182 --> 00:38:31.100
And anyway,
what kind of company shuts down

732
00:38:31.101 --> 00:38:32.977
just because the government tells them to?

733
00:38:32.978 --> 00:38:35.187
All the ones in your short portfolio.

734
00:38:35.188 --> 00:38:37.147
- And yours.
- Ah!

735
00:38:37.148 --> 00:38:39.775
<i>- All except for one actually.
- Which one?</i>

736
00:38:39.776 --> 00:38:41.735
<i>- GameStop.
- How?</i>

737
00:38:41.736 --> 00:38:44.405
<i>They sell computer mouses. Mice?</i>

738
00:38:44.406 --> 00:38:46.574
<i>They claim it makes them
an essential business.</i>

739
00:38:46.575 --> 00:38:49.159
<i>That is the smartest dumbest thing
I've ever heard.</i>

740
00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:51.954
<i>I know, it's actually a fun one.
The revenue's in the toilet.</i>

741
00:38:51.955 --> 00:38:54.748
<i>632 million net loss last year.</i>

742
00:38:54.749 --> 00:38:57.793
<i>They'd be better off just burning
the whole company down.</i>

743
00:38:57.794 --> 00:39:00.963
<i>The stock though, it has been volatile.
It's been up.</i>

744
00:39:00.964 --> 00:39:03.549
- Buybacks?
- Retail traders.

745
00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:05.759
Bro. I don't have it, bro.

746
00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:06.885
- Damn, brother.
- Sorry, man.

747
00:39:06.886 --> 00:39:08.345
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Have a good one, bro.

748
00:39:08.346 --> 00:39:10.765
- Yo, stay up though! Aight, bro. Aight.
- Yeah.

749
00:39:16.438 --> 00:39:18.063
I'm gonna put these back real quick.

750
00:39:25.572 --> 00:39:26.740
Hey, Marcos.

751
00:39:27.699 --> 00:39:28.867
Yes, Bradley?

752
00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:32.703
Uh, I... I love how you engaged
with that customer,

753
00:39:32.704 --> 00:39:34.997
but we really wanna close
those pre-owned sales.

754
00:39:34.998 --> 00:39:36.373
The margin's more than double.

755
00:39:36.374 --> 00:39:37.875
Oh shit, double.

756
00:39:37.876 --> 00:39:39.835
Yeah, you didn't do
any of the five prongs, dude:

757
00:39:39.836 --> 00:39:43.297
Pre-orders. Reward-card subscriptions.
Used sales. New sales. Trade-ins.

758
00:39:43.298 --> 00:39:45.090
Yeah, I mean,
when I was a 16-year old gamer,

759
00:39:45.091 --> 00:39:47.092
all I wanted was a reward-card
subscription.

760
00:39:47.093 --> 00:39:50.430
$5 cash back monthly,
20 points for every dollar spent...

761
00:39:51.014 --> 00:39:51.848
Don't get me started.

762
00:39:51.849 --> 00:39:54.433
A lot of really smart people in corporate
put this plan together.

763
00:39:54.434 --> 00:39:56.852
Yeah, but any of them
ever played a video game?

764
00:39:56.853 --> 00:39:59.813
Uh, it doesn't matter, Marcos,
because they own our asses.

765
00:39:59.814 --> 00:40:02.984
Yo, they don't own my ass, so.

766
00:40:03.526 --> 00:40:04.610
They do,

767
00:40:04.611 --> 00:40:06.071
and they always will.

768
00:40:09.157 --> 00:40:10.200
Mask.

769
00:40:12.118 --> 00:40:13.370
Hey, Bradley.

770
00:40:16.498 --> 00:40:18.583
You ever heard of a short squeeze?

771
00:40:26.341 --> 00:40:28.134
Is that a sexual thing?

772
00:40:29.969 --> 00:40:31.346
No.

773
00:40:32.806 --> 00:40:34.181
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

774
00:40:34.182 --> 00:40:36.809
<i>Here's what's going on.
Late last year,</i>

775
00:40:36.810 --> 00:40:41.480
<i>hedge funds started shorting stock
in the retail store GameStop.</i>

776
00:40:41.481 --> 00:40:45.067
<i>Meaning they had bet against it
and needed it to drop in price</i>

777
00:40:45.068 --> 00:40:48.862
<i>for their investments to be successful.
Now unfortunately for the hedge funds,</i>

778
00:40:48.863 --> 00:40:54.410
<i>small investors started buying the stock
led by something called Wall Street Bets,</i>

779
00:40:54.411 --> 00:40:58.080
<i>a popular, juvenile,
foul-mouthed Reddit page.</i>

780
00:40:58.081 --> 00:40:59.915
<i>And when Wall Street Bets noticed</i>

781
00:40:59.916 --> 00:41:03.752
<i>that hedge funds had taken
a large short position in GameStop stock,</i>

782
00:41:03.753 --> 00:41:06.422
<i>they decided to punish
the Wall Street big boys</i>

783
00:41:06.423 --> 00:41:09.259
<i>and launched a coordinated buying spree.</i>

784
00:41:09.884 --> 00:41:12.886
<i>The revolutionaries on Reddit
are spanking Wall Street's ass.</i>

785
00:41:12.887 --> 00:41:18.976
<i>GameStop shares absolutely going nuts.
I think it was up over 70% at one point.</i>

786
00:41:18.977 --> 00:41:20.936
<i>- Massive short squeeze,</i>
- Show me...

787
00:41:20.937 --> 00:41:23.689
- <i>closing there, with a gain of 51%</i>
- the tendiesss!

788
00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:25.649
<i>After traders on message boards...</i>

789
00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:30.487
What?

790
00:41:30.488 --> 00:41:35.492
Happy Wednesday! Happy hump day!
Gee... look at this!

791
00:41:35.493 --> 00:41:36.910
Look at this shit!

792
00:41:36.911 --> 00:41:40.122
A 90% increase in one day?
In one fucking day!

793
00:41:40.123 --> 00:41:43.500
We're goin' to the mooooon.

794
00:41:43.501 --> 00:41:46.670
Whoa-ho-ho-ho!

795
00:41:46.671 --> 00:41:49.298
Okay, now, if you've been watching
this price action,

796
00:41:49.299 --> 00:41:50.466
this is what I'm talking about.

797
00:41:50.467 --> 00:41:52.551
<i>Yeah, but you can really feel that panic
from Wall Street, right.</i>

798
00:41:52.552 --> 00:41:54.928
When they... we're starting to feel
a little squeeze. Starting to feel it.

799
00:41:54.929 --> 00:41:56.472
You're starting to really feel
a little squeeze.

800
00:41:56.473 --> 00:41:59.266
I need a drink. I need a drink.
I know we all drinking tonight.

801
00:41:59.267 --> 00:42:00.809
We fucking did it!

802
00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:03.604
We started from the bottom
and now we're here!

803
00:42:03.605 --> 00:42:06.982
Let's raise a glass

804
00:42:06.983 --> 00:42:10.904
to a great company
that's undervalued, cheers.

805
00:42:11.488 --> 00:42:15.115
<i>Soon may the tendiemen come...
Show me the ten dies. Show me the ten dies.</i>

806
00:42:15.116 --> 00:42:16.366
I got 'em right here.

807
00:42:16.367 --> 00:42:19.745
Show me the ten dies. I just gotta...
I just gotta dip.

808
00:42:19.746 --> 00:42:22.457
I just gotta... I just gotta dip. Ah!

809
00:42:23.875 --> 00:42:24.709
Mmm.

<i>♪ No way

811
00:42:27.545 --> 00:42:30.380
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

812
00:42:30.381 --> 00:42:32.090
11 fucking million dollars?

813
00:42:32.091 --> 00:42:33.051
<i>What the fuck!</i>

814
00:42:33.052 --> 00:42:35.803
- Oh, language. The baby's here.
- <i>What are you gonna do?</i>

815
00:42:35.804 --> 00:42:38.096
Get a Ferrari? A Lambo?

816
00:42:38.097 --> 00:42:39.848
Caroline, you're gonna ask for
a big diamond, right?

817
00:42:39.849 --> 00:42:41.225
I have a diamond.

818
00:42:41.226 --> 00:42:43.685
<i>Keith, you get a fucking diamond!
If I were you, I'd look like</i>

819
00:42:43.686 --> 00:42:46.271
- <i>DJ Khaled right now.</i>
- Kev! It's not real.

820
00:42:46.272 --> 00:42:47.898
I mean, it's real, but it's just paper.

821
00:42:47.899 --> 00:42:50.984
Just on paper! You're gonna sell, right?

822
00:42:50.985 --> 00:42:52.278
- No!
- Maybe.

823
00:42:52.821 --> 00:42:55.531
I mean, I don't know. Uh...

824
00:42:55.532 --> 00:42:59.034
- We... we haven't talked about it.
- <i>What the fuck is wrong with you?</i>

825
00:42:59.035 --> 00:43:02.287
I'm riding Mom's bike every day
to Dorchester to drop off cheeseburgers

826
00:43:02.288 --> 00:43:03.747
because you won't let me use
your fucking car.

827
00:43:03.748 --> 00:43:05.916
And you're mister "I won't sell
and take millions of dollars."

828
00:43:05.917 --> 00:43:08.252
And, well, what you do with your life
is your choice.

829
00:43:08.253 --> 00:43:11.171
<i>You think I wanted to get laid off
from Dick's during a global pandemic?</i>

830
00:43:11.172 --> 00:43:14.383
I love those sneakers, man.
I loved that store. I love Dick's.

831
00:43:14.384 --> 00:43:17.469
- <i>Mom's bike doesn't even have gears.</i>
- We don't know if it's reached the top.

832
00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:20.389
The stock jumped like 23% yesterday.

833
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:22.266
- Double from Friday's close.
- But he's right.

834
00:43:22.267 --> 00:43:24.643
I mean, 11 million dollars
is a lot of fucking dough.

835
00:43:24.644 --> 00:43:25.894
- Thank you!
<i>- Okay, yes,</i>

00:43:30.358 --> 00:43:32.776
Got a 2 billion market cap.
I mean, could it go pff? Yeah.

839
00:43:32.777 --> 00:43:35.738
But that's not what I'm seeing.
That's not what I'm seeing, Kev.

840
00:43:36.823 --> 00:43:38.575
Kev? You there?

841
00:43:41.202 --> 00:43:42.328
Did he hang up?

842
00:43:43.037 --> 00:43:44.372
Yeah.

843
00:43:54.883 --> 00:43:56.758
Fuck, I think hold.

844
00:44:00.054 --> 00:44:02.764
- Girl, you gotta sell.
- I'm not selling.

845
00:44:02.765 --> 00:44:03.974
How much are you up?

846
00:44:03.975 --> 00:44:05.976
58,000 and some change.

847
00:44:08.438 --> 00:44:10.856
Baby girl, what the fuck?

848
00:44:10.857 --> 00:44:12.983
You need to get out while you can.

849
00:44:12.984 --> 00:44:15.652
- Don't be an idiot.
- You remember red headband guy.

850
00:44:15.653 --> 00:44:19.156
He's worth 11 million dollars.
And he's not selling.

851
00:44:19.157 --> 00:44:21.199
- No fucking way.
- Yes fucking way.

852
00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.828
This is what I'm telling you.
Diamond hands.

853
00:44:24.996 --> 00:44:28.540
Diamond hands. You hold the line
no matter what the market does.

854
00:44:28.541 --> 00:44:29.958
No matter what Wall Street says.

855
00:44:29.959 --> 00:44:32.002
What happens
when everyone else sells first,

856
00:44:32.003 --> 00:44:34.755
and before you get out
you've lost all your money?

857
00:44:34.756 --> 00:44:36.506
Are there any volunteers?

858
00:44:36.507 --> 00:44:38.383
- I'm...
- Anyone?

859
00:44:38.384 --> 00:44:40.594
- We're gonna hold the line.
- C'mon.

860
00:44:40.595 --> 00:44:42.722
- Someone has to go first.
- Okay, yeah. I'll do it.

861
00:44:48.102 --> 00:44:49.645
Here we go everyone.

862
00:44:49.646 --> 00:44:52.648
The first Covid vaccine
at Pittsburgh Presbyterian.

863
00:44:52.649 --> 00:44:54.107
<i>Ah!</i>

864
00:44:54.108 --> 00:44:55.567
Fuck! Fuck!

865
00:44:55.568 --> 00:44:59.572
<i>Fuck! Guys, we need your help.
What should we do?</i>

866
00:45:00.823 --> 00:45:04.660
So listen, my girl bought in under 20
and now it is over 60.

867
00:45:04.661 --> 00:45:06.578
So like, should she sell?

868
00:45:06.579 --> 00:45:08.873
On the one hand, she has principles.

869
00:45:09.916 --> 00:45:13.293
On the other,
she has 100k in student debt. So...

870
00:45:13.294 --> 00:45:16.046
One way you could think
about the comparison between

871
00:45:16.047 --> 00:45:18.674
Marxism and Utilitarian tradition

872
00:45:18.675 --> 00:45:22.386
is that they both have a micro story
and a macro story.

873
00:45:22.387 --> 00:45:24.763
When you think of Utilitarian tradition...

874
00:45:24.764 --> 00:45:29.185
The only thing that would convince her
to sell is if Roaring Kitty sold.

875
00:45:30.395 --> 00:45:32.813
So... Where my pussy at?

876
00:45:32.814 --> 00:45:35.899
You have the micro story
for the Pareto principle

877
00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:38.653
for how each individual action will go.

878
00:45:39.487 --> 00:45:40.737
But you also have a macro story.

879
00:45:40.738 --> 00:45:42.864
<i>Where my pussy at? Where my pussy at?</i>

880
00:45:42.865 --> 00:45:45.033
<i>- Where my pussy at?!</i>
- Sorry.

881
00:45:45.034 --> 00:45:48.286
<i>Where my pussy aaaaatttt?!</i>

882
00:45:48.287 --> 00:45:49.830
I'm so sorry.

883
00:45:49.831 --> 00:45:53.208
Hey, hey, where my pussy at? Ha!

884
00:45:53.209 --> 00:45:56.087
- Where is my pussy at?
- It's not in here.

885
00:46:17.025 --> 00:46:18.775
Whoa,

886
00:46:18.776 --> 00:46:21.362

- How was your day?
- Long.

934
00:49:00.479 --> 00:49:05.067
It's so hard to keep them focused
on Zoom school. They're just not into it.

935
00:49:05.943 --> 00:49:07.569
How was your day?

936
00:49:07.570 --> 00:49:08.738
Good.

937
00:49:11.032 --> 00:49:13.491
You're not worried
about the short squeeze thing?

938
00:49:13.492 --> 00:49:15.577
The dam'll break next week.

939
00:49:15.578 --> 00:49:18.163
A few of them will decide it's gone
high enough, they'll cash out,

940
00:49:18.164 --> 00:49:21.249
the rest will follow,
whole thing will come crashing down.

941
00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:24.420
I can't think of the last short squeeze
that actually worked.

942
00:49:25.379 --> 00:49:26.714
Ackman and Herbalife.

943
00:49:27.298 --> 00:49:29.299
Before that... Piggly Wiggly?

944
00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:30.634
Piggly Wiggly.

945
00:49:30.635 --> 00:49:35.305
Yeah. 1923, a bear cartel was shorting
the Piggly Wiggly grocery store.

946
00:49:35.306 --> 00:49:40.352
The founder, he takes out a loan
for what would be $150 million today.

947
00:49:40.353 --> 00:49:42.812
He buys back almost all the stock,
like 99% of the stock.

948
00:49:42.813 --> 00:49:45.148
The price of the stock goes up 50%.

949
00:49:45.149 --> 00:49:47.400
- How much is GameStop up?
- Then, the exchange,

950
00:49:47.401 --> 00:49:49.277
they halt trading on the stock

951
00:49:49.278 --> 00:49:52.113
so the short sellers
can cover their positions.

952
00:49:52.114 --> 00:49:53.782
Is that legal?

953
00:49:53.783 --> 00:49:56.535
The founder had to
declare bankruptcy. So...

954
00:49:57.411 --> 00:49:58.912
it was all fine in the end.

955
00:49:58.913 --> 00:50:01.457
And you knew all that or you looked it up?

956
00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:04.710
Every fund manager knows that story.

957
00:50:08.798 --> 00:50:10.174
You looked it up.

958
00:50:12.009 --> 00:50:13.886
Double checked some numbers maybe.

959
00:50:23.271 --> 00:50:26.189

960
00:50:26.190 --> 00:50:28.483

961
00:50:28.484 --> 00:50:32.404
<i>- They won't hold much longer.
- Oh, Gabe, honey, they're holding.</i>

962
00:50:32.405 --> 00:50:34.489

00:52:15.883 --> 00:52:17.759
And betray your boyfriend?
Absolutely not. No.

1006
00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:19.761
- <i>The stock is up 581%.</i>
- Maybe.

1007
00:52:19.762 --> 00:52:21.930
<i>They are being very specific:</i>

1008
00:52:21.931 --> 00:52:23.223
<i>- To break the shorts.
- Yes.</i>

1009
00:52:23.224 --> 00:52:25.350
<i>I mean, what's going on
in GameStop right now</i>

1010
00:52:25.351 --> 00:52:27.185
<i>conceivably could take
a couple of firms out.</i>

1011
00:52:27.186 --> 00:52:30.021
<i>Hedge funds if they were
stupid enough to be short.</i>

1012
00:52:30.022 --> 00:52:32.066
Babe, how much did we make today?

1013
00:52:33.526 --> 00:52:34.526
5 million.

1014
00:52:34.985 --> 00:52:36.486
And yesterday?

1015
00:52:36.487 --> 00:52:37.655
4 million.

1016
00:52:40.199 --> 00:52:41.199
Babe...

1017
00:52:41.742 --> 00:52:42.785
Yeah?

1018
00:52:43.744 --> 00:52:46.454
We're, like, really fucking rich.

1019
00:52:53.129 --> 00:52:54.880
How much did we lose today?

1020
00:52:57.425 --> 00:52:58.425
A billion.

1021
00:53:00.928 --> 00:53:01.928
And yesterday?

1022
00:53:03.472 --> 00:53:04.473
A billion.

1023
00:53:09.354 --> 00:53:12.147
<i>Some news to bring you right now
is that Melvin Capital Management,</i>

1024
00:53:12.148 --> 00:53:16.276
<i>this is the hedge fund
that had shorted this company,</i>

1025
00:53:16.277 --> 00:53:21.948
<i>that had effectively been attacked
by an army of investors trying to push up</i>

1026
00:53:21.949 --> 00:53:24.784
<i>and press up the stock of GameStop.</i>

1027
00:53:24.785 --> 00:53:27.370
<i>They've taken a rather huge loss...</i>

1028
00:53:27.371 --> 00:53:30.291
Sorry, if you could just
put your head up for a sec?

1029
00:53:30.958 --> 00:53:31.958
Thanks.

1030
00:53:32.376 --> 00:53:33.794
How long've you been down here?

1031
00:53:34.295 --> 00:53:35.295
A few months.

1032
00:53:36.589 --> 00:53:37.923
You like the weather?

1033
00:53:40.092 --> 00:53:43.553
Heat is nice. The humidity not as much.

1034
00:53:43.554 --> 00:53:45.388
I can see that.

1035
00:53:45.389 --> 00:53:48.976
- Hm.
- All right, I think you're good to go.

1036
00:54:14.668 --> 00:54:16.586
- Hey!
<i>- Hey, man.</i>

1037
00:54:16.587 --> 00:54:18.421
- Hi.
- <i>It's good to connect.</i>

1038
00:54:18.422 --> 00:54:19.631
You too. Great to be here.

1039
00:54:19.632 --> 00:54:20.798
- Excited.
<i>- I'm glad you are.</i>

1040
00:54:20.799 --> 00:54:22.592
<i>Listen, I want to get right to it.</i>

1041
00:54:22.593 --> 00:54:25.471
<i>From what I'm hearing,
you guys are bankrupt.</i>

1042
00:54:27.223 --> 00:54:28.723
No! What? No.

1043
00:54:28.724 --> 00:54:31.809
<i>'Cause the word on the street
is that you're drowning.</i>

1044
00:54:31.810 --> 00:54:34.062
No, that's... That's crazy.

1045
00:54:34.063 --> 00:54:36.565
- We're doing great.
- <i>You're on the record with that?</i>

1046
00:54:37.149 --> 00:54:38.025
Obviously.

1047
00:54:38.026 --> 00:54:41.277
<i>All right, man. Well, then, we're gonna
get the live feed up right now,</i>

1048
00:54:41.278 --> 00:54:43.947
<i>and then we're gonna get to you
right after this next advertising break.</i>

1049
00:54:43.948 --> 00:54:45.783
Perfect, great. Yes, can't wait.

1050
00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:52.121
<i>All right, one more spot
and then you're gonna be up.</i>

1051
00:54:52.122 --> 00:54:55.208
<i>I really do think this is the right time
for you to communicate.</i>

1052
00:54:55.209 --> 00:54:57.293
- Great, yes. Agreed.
- <i>Great. We're gonna do it.</i>

1053
00:54:57.294 --> 00:54:59.797
<i>Address it all head on.
It's gonna be good</i>.

1054
00:55:01.882 --> 00:55:04.050
- No.
- <i>What? Gabe, we're on in 10 seconds.</i>

1055
00:55:04.051 --> 00:55:05.343
I can't do this. I'm sorry.

1056
00:55:05.344 --> 00:55:06.262
<i>Gabe, seriously.</i>

1057
00:55:06.263 --> 00:55:08.012
- Bye, I'm terribly sorry.
<i>- Seriously, c'mon.</i>

1058
00:55:08.013 --> 00:55:10.653
- Good to see you. The pleasure's here.
- <i>We're going on right now.</i>

1059
00:55:16.605 --> 00:55:17.605
Babe,

1060
00:55:18.607 --> 00:55:19.775
what's the damage?

1061
00:55:52.099 --> 00:55:53.391
Let me guess, you need cash.

1062
00:55:53.392 --> 00:55:55.435
<i>Didn't call Ken first, did you?</i>

1063
00:55:55.436 --> 00:55:57.104
He had Phillips reach out.

1064
00:55:57.605 --> 00:55:58.981
<i>How much did he offer?</i>

1065
00:56:00.482 --> 00:56:01.941
I haven't called him back yet.

1066
00:56:01.942 --> 00:56:03.401
Well, how much do you need?

1067
00:56:03.402 --> 00:56:05.820
You know what? Don't answer that.
The number doesn't matter.

1068
00:56:05.821 --> 00:56:07.405
Whatever it is, I'd love to buy in.

1069
00:56:07.406 --> 00:56:09.490
<i>Tell Ken to fill in the rest.</i>

1070
00:56:09.491 --> 00:56:10.701
Prick.

1071
00:56:16.749 --> 00:56:17.790
- <i>Hey, Ken.</i>
- Hey.

1072
00:56:17.791 --> 00:56:20.919
<i>Hi, um... So, I might need...</i>

1073
00:56:21.837 --> 00:56:22.837
<i>Uh...</i>

1074
00:56:23.672 --> 00:56:24.672
<i>A new investor.</i>

1075
00:56:24.673 --> 00:56:25.965
Consider it done.

1076
00:56:25.966 --> 00:56:27.967
<i>Just keep moving forward.</i>

1077
00:56:27.968 --> 00:56:30.595
<i>Don't think about
what Grandpa Melvin used to say.</i>

1078
00:56:30.596 --> 00:56:31.930
Prick.

1079
00:56:33.807 --> 00:56:35.767
- Thank you.
<i>- Both Citadel</i>

1080
00:56:35.768 --> 00:56:39.479
- <i>and Point72 have infused</i>
- Poor guy.

1081
00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:42.982
<i>$3 billion into Melvin Capital</i>

1082
00:56:42.983 --> 00:56:45.860
- <i>to try to shore up...</i>
- Another goddamn bailout.

1083
00:56:45.861 --> 00:56:47.570
Can you believe this crap?

1084
00:56:47.571 --> 00:56:48.780
Nobody bailed me out

1085
00:56:48.781 --> 00:56:51.783
when Richard left me alone
with two toddlers, a mortgage,

1086
00:56:51.784 --> 00:56:53.076
a shit car that never works.

1087
00:56:53.077 --> 00:56:54.827
You can say "shit" but we can't?

1088
00:56:54.828 --> 00:56:56.871
It's just so damn unfair and you know it.

1089
00:56:56.872 --> 00:57:00.875
All we've done for the last year
is work our asses off helping people,

1090
00:57:00.876 --> 00:57:03.586
and all we've gotten is one $600 check.

1091
00:57:03.587 --> 00:57:06.631
This idiot effs up just about as bad
as anyone could eff,

1092
00:57:06.632 --> 00:57:09.676
and his friends come running in
with $3 billion.

1093
00:57:09.677 --> 00:57:11.928
That's why I keep telling you:
you're never gonna win.

1094
00:57:11.929 --> 00:57:14.514
Just take the money and do something nice.
Pay off your mortgage.

1095
00:57:14.515 --> 00:57:16.058
Get that one braces.

1096
00:57:16.642 --> 00:57:18.143
Look who's still holding.

1097
00:57:19.603 --> 00:57:21.604
If he's in, I'm in.

1098
00:57:21.605 --> 00:57:23.564
Yeah, he's still gonna need braces.

1099
00:57:23.565 --> 00:57:24.649
Your teeth are perfect.

1100
00:57:24.650 --> 00:57:27.902
So what? The stock's up $150.
How much higher is it gonna go?

1101
00:57:27.903 --> 00:57:30.196
We control the price now. Not Wall Street.

1102
00:57:30.197 --> 00:57:31.698
And no one on there is selling.

1103
00:57:31.699 --> 00:57:32.740
Shoes.

1104
00:57:32.741 --> 00:57:34.951
- Ugh. You're all so delusional.
- Maybe.

1105
00:57:34.952 --> 00:57:37.370
But look at what we managed to do
with these hedge funds.

1106
00:57:37.371 --> 00:57:38.996
If we keep driving up the price,

1107
00:57:38.997 --> 00:57:42.166
maybe we'll scare more of these guys
into closing out their shorts,

1108
00:57:42.167 --> 00:57:44.252
and then all of that bailout money...

1109
00:57:44.253 --> 00:57:45.670
- Wait...
- becomes ours.

1110
00:57:45.671 --> 00:57:46.671
Your screen name...

1111
00:57:47.381 --> 00:57:48.924
is Stonkmom?

1112
00:57:53.345 --> 00:57:54.345
- Hey!
- Help your mother.

1113
00:57:54.346 --> 00:57:56.848
- Why me and not Keith?
- Just shut up and do it, okay?

1114
00:57:56.849 --> 00:57:59.058
- Kev, take the potatoes.
- 'Cause you're rich now?

1115
00:57:59.059 --> 00:58:01.144
Mr. 23 million on paper but I won't sell.

1116
00:58:01.145 --> 00:58:03.397
- Kevin.
- Loser says what?

1117
00:58:04.398 --> 00:58:06.859
- What?
- Kevin, let Keith tell them.

1118
00:58:10.070 --> 00:58:11.070
Tell us what?

1119
00:58:12.573 --> 00:58:15.283
Oh, uh...
I was waiting to tell you in person.

1120
00:58:15.284 --> 00:58:18.411
But the, uh, stock we bet on,
GameStop, is up.

1121
00:58:18.412 --> 00:58:19.580
Ah, good.

1122
00:58:20.706 --> 00:58:23.167
- How much up?
- He's up 23 million, Pop.

1123
00:58:23.751 --> 00:58:24.751
You're an asshole.

1124
00:58:24.752 --> 00:58:27.295
- Don't kid us.
- Uh, it's real.

1125
00:58:27.296 --> 00:58:29.965
Yeah, it's real.
And he's refusing to sell.

1126
00:58:31.842 --> 00:58:32.885
What is going on?

1127
00:58:33.927 --> 00:58:35.261
- You're pulling our leg.
- No.

1128
00:58:35.262 --> 00:58:37.180
Your son's a huge Internet celebrity now.

1129
00:58:37.181 --> 00:58:40.016
Millions of people including "Stonkmom"
thinks he's some like,

1130
00:58:40.017 --> 00:58:42.185
- I don't know, investment genius.
- No, he is a genius.

1131
00:58:42.186 --> 00:58:43.394
No, he's not.

1132
00:58:43.395 --> 00:58:45.147
You're up 23 million?

1133
00:58:46.148 --> 00:58:47.566
And you're not selling.

1134
00:58:49.193 --> 00:58:50.526
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

1135
00:58:50.527 --> 00:58:52.028
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1136
00:58:52.029 --> 00:58:54.363
Do you even know
how much $23 million is?

1137
00:58:54.364 --> 00:58:56.657
And you're just gonna let it ride?
What's the matter with you?

1138
00:58:56.658 --> 00:58:58.868
- I know what I'm doing, Dad.
- But why aren't you selling?

1139
00:58:58.869 --> 00:59:00.787
What, wait! Is this illegal?
Are you in trouble?

1140
00:59:00.788 --> 00:59:01.954
No. No, he's not in trouble.

1141
00:59:01.955 --> 00:59:03.039
- It's totally legal.
- Yeah.

1142
00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:04.832
He's posting his balance sheet
on the Internet.

1143
00:59:04.833 --> 00:59:06.000
- What?
- Hedge fund managers,

1144
00:59:06.001 --> 00:59:08.461
they go on CNBC all the time
to pump up the stock.

1145
00:59:08.462 --> 00:59:10.922
All I do is post my balance sheet
on Wall Street Bets

1146
00:59:10.923 --> 00:59:14.175
- after market close.
- You post your balance sheet?

1147
00:59:14.176 --> 00:59:15.343
Yeah, the same idiot

1148
00:59:15.344 --> 00:59:18.137
who left a fresh pair of Nikes out on
the bleachers for just anyone to take.

1149
00:59:18.138 --> 00:59:19.305
So you admit they were stolen!

1150
00:59:19.306 --> 00:59:20.932
- We gotta talk about this.
- You're a fuckin' moron.

1151
00:59:20.933 --> 00:59:22.391
- Least I won.
- What's the point of winning

1152
00:59:22.392 --> 00:59:23.726
if you let some dipshit steal the prize?

1153
00:59:23.727 --> 00:59:25.269
You would've broke a four
if you had the Zooms.

1154
00:59:25.270 --> 00:59:26.771
A four minute mile
isn't everything, Kevin.

1155
00:59:26.772 --> 00:59:28.648
Maybe we should get in touch
with Briggsy.

1156
00:59:28.649 --> 00:59:30.650
- You know, he works in finance.
- Yes.

1157
00:59:30.651 --> 00:59:32.860
You think Briggsy knows
more about this than Keith does?

1158
00:59:32.861 --> 00:59:34.904
Well, can you talk about why
you're putting your stocks

1159
00:59:34.905 --> 00:59:37.156
- in the Wall Street Journal?
- Wall Street Bets.

1160
00:59:37.157 --> 00:59:38.741
What if someone tries to rob you?
Kidnap the baby?

1161
00:59:38.742 --> 00:59:39.992
No one's gonna kidnap the baby.

1162
00:59:39.993 --> 00:59:41.869
- Nobody wants that baby, Mom.
- I'm just saying,

1163
00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:43.162
that if we're gonna talk to somebody,

1164
00:59:43.163 --> 00:59:44.872
- you need to talk to Briggsy.
- Yes, honey.

1165
00:59:44.873 --> 00:59:46.458
- This is the point...
- Enough!

1166
00:59:47.543 --> 00:59:49.126
You guys, Keith has literally

1167
00:59:49.127 --> 00:59:51.420
poured his heart and his soul
into this for the past year.

1168
00:59:51.421 --> 00:59:52.798
He knows what he's doing.

1169
00:59:58.554 --> 01:00:01.056
I know it's been a tough time, Elaine.

1170
01:00:08.981 --> 01:00:10.065
You should still sell.

1171
01:00:12.484 --> 01:00:13.652
Think you should sell.

1172
01:00:17.489 --> 01:00:19.782
And just fuck the principle
of the whole thing?

1173
01:00:19.783 --> 01:00:21.742
I don't like it any more than you do.

1174
01:00:37.092 --> 01:00:38.551
You really don't think
that he's fucking selling?

1175
01:00:38.552 --> 01:00:39.552
No!

1176
01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:40.970
Ladies.

1177
01:00:42.347 --> 01:00:43.347
Masks.

1178
01:00:46.727 --> 01:00:50.104
Kids are with their father for a few days.
So, I'm going to Florida.

1179
01:00:50.105 --> 01:00:52.857
You finally fucking sold.
Halle­fuckin-lujah.

1180
01:00:52.858 --> 01:00:54.984
No, I'm putting it on my Visa.

1181
01:00:54.985 --> 01:00:56.068
You shitting me?

1182
01:00:56.069 --> 01:00:58.237
You're worth hundreds of thousands
of dollars in stock,

1183
01:00:58.238 --> 01:00:59.864
and you're amassing credit card debt.

1184
01:00:59.865 --> 01:01:01.866
You really are out of your mind.

1185
01:01:01.867 --> 01:01:05.870
No, babe, I'm all in. Diamond hand.

1186
01:01:05.871 --> 01:01:07.955
Did you know that Gabe Plotkin
gave an interview?

1187
01:01:07.956 --> 01:01:10.499
He's been getting death threats,
anti-Semitic messages

1188
01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.835
- from these WSB guys.
- It was ten comments.

1189
01:01:12.836 --> 01:01:15.755
There's always bad apples.
And the moderators deleted it right away.

1190
01:01:15.756 --> 01:01:17.840
You're just gonna ride this thing
till zero?

1191
01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:20.051
No. I'm buying call options.

1192
01:01:20.052 --> 01:01:23.597
- That could go to 600 by tomorrow.
- Your kid is never getting braces.

1193
01:01:31.605 --> 01:01:34.148
<i>There's 8 million people in there
and they're all holding.</i>

1194
01:01:34.149 --> 01:01:35.274
<i>It's only going to go up.</i>

1195
01:01:35.275 --> 01:01:36.817
It's a joke, Marcos.

1196
01:01:36.818 --> 01:01:38.862
But you're treating it
like it's real life.

1197
01:01:39.738 --> 01:01:40.738
Pops.

1198
01:01:42.783 --> 01:01:43.783
Look.

1199
01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:47.078
- This is real. Hold it. Look.
- Hey.

1200
01:01:47.079 --> 01:01:48.079
Aw, man.

1201
01:01:49.706 --> 01:01:51.415
8 million people is real.

1202
01:01:51.416 --> 01:01:53.085
H-O-D-L.

1203
01:01:53.794 --> 01:01:57.254
8 million don't even know
how to spell "hold."

1204
01:01:57.255 --> 01:01:58.173
It's a joke.

1205
01:01:58.174 --> 01:02:01.014
- A corny joke.
- It's not funny.

1206
01:02:04.721 --> 01:02:05.721
Mom,

1207
01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:07.932
look.

1208
01:02:07.933 --> 01:02:10.559
I got $175,000 in stock right now.

1209
01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:11.727
What?

1210
01:02:11.728 --> 01:02:12.688
Like serious money,

1211
01:02:12.689 --> 01:02:15.773
like I could get you a house
and get you up out of here, kind of money.

1212
01:02:15.774 --> 01:02:16.941
Baby.

1213
01:02:16.942 --> 01:02:19.360
Where did you get the money to buy this?

1214
01:02:19.361 --> 01:02:20.444
Uh-huh.

1215
01:02:20.445 --> 01:02:23.322
I bought call options, for cheap.

1216
01:02:23.323 --> 01:02:26.409
- And they hit.
- So now you're gonna sell?

1217
01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:27.828
Nah. No, I buy more.

1218
01:02:28.662 --> 01:02:30.496
At this price!?

1219
01:02:30.497 --> 01:02:32.540
When they hit,
I'm gonna buy you a mansion.

1220
01:02:32.541 --> 01:02:33.624
It's gonna be crazy.

1221
01:02:33.625 --> 01:02:36.420
My son, I don't need a mansion.

1222
01:02:38.338 --> 01:02:39.715
<i>Papi.</i>

1223
01:02:40.090 --> 01:02:41.258
Be careful.

1224
01:02:41.758 --> 01:02:44.135
Don't get addicted to this, my son.

1225
01:02:44.136 --> 01:02:45.846
This can be like a drug.

1226
01:02:51.893 --> 01:02:56.647

- We never have.</i>

1239
01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:28.929
<i>It's like generational injustices.</i>

1240
01:03:28.930 --> 01:03:32.391
<i>This is like

1241

Hey, did you try a different browser?

1257
01:04:21.733 --> 01:04:24.027
- I plugged the browser.
- Shit, we're fucked.

1258
01:04:25.195 --> 01:04:26.362
Bro, what the fuck?

1259
01:04:26.363 --> 01:04:28.563
- What the fuck, dude?

What?

1264
01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:52.264
They shut down Wall Street Bets.

- What?
- "Hateful and discriminatory content."

1266

That's weird.

01:05:04.317 --> 01:05:05.318
No?

1269
01:05:06.361 --> 01:05:09.697
I mean, it's like they're trying
to stop people from talking to each other.

1270

Babe, are you gonna get that?

1271
01:05:18.206 --> 01:05:19.124
Yes.

Oh.

1273
01:05:22.169 --> 01:05:23.169
Hello?

1274
01:05:24.671 --> 01:05:27.632
Ah, yes, I am...

1275
01:05:28.133 --> 01:05:31.386
I am the Roaring Kitty
and Deep F-ing Value.

1276
01:05:33.180 --> 01:05:36.600
Ah, no, but nobody ever asked me.

1277
01:05:38.685 --> 01:05:40.019
Oh, okay.

1278
01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:42.813
Sir, I just want to say
how grateful I am for this job

1279
01:05:42.814 --> 01:05:44.732
and how much it means
to me and my family.

1280
01:05:44.733 --> 01:05:47.152
I would never let a hobby jeopardize...

1281
01:05:48.862 --> 01:05:50.822
Okay. I understand.

1282
01:05:56.786 --> 01:05:59.246
- Yeah?
- It's MassMutual. They're...

1283
01:05:59.247 --> 01:06:02.666
getting calls from reporters "concerned"
about my "outside activities."

1284
01:06:02.667 --> 01:06:04.543
Was all this against the rules?

1285
01:06:04.544 --> 01:06:07.463
I wasn't...? Maybe now it is...

1286
01:06:07.464 --> 01:06:08.464
Okay.

1287
01:06:11.426 --> 01:06:12.969
Well, what was that call?

1288
01:06:14.596 --> 01:06:16.055
- Keith?
- It's okay.

1289
01:06:16.056 --> 01:06:17.264
What, are you going to lose your job?

1290
01:06:17.265 --> 01:06:18.265
- What?
- It's fine.

1291
01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:21.143
- They gave me a choice.
- Between what?

1292
01:06:21.144 --> 01:06:22.937
Between your job and Roaring Kitty?

1293
01:06:22.938 --> 01:06:24.855
Uh...

1294
01:06:24.856 --> 01:06:27.733
- Resign or I'm fired.
- That's what he just said?

1295
01:06:29.027 --> 01:06:30.027
I got it.

1296
01:06:32.239 --> 01:06:33.364
<i>Fuck it, Wall Street Bets is down,</i>

1297
01:06:33.365 --> 01:06:34.282
<i>I can't see Roaring Kitty's balance sheet.</i>

1298
01:06:34.282 --> 01:06:35.200
Oh fuck.

1299
01:06:35.201 --> 01:06:36.451
I don't know what to do.

1300
01:06:36.952 --> 01:06:38.035
This could be the sell-off.

1301
01:06:38.036 --> 01:06:40.079
I really don't wanna do that.

1302
01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:43.250
Well, me neither.
But you can't let it go to zero.

1303
01:06:44.125 --> 01:06:46.460
It's 150 grand. You need that money.

1304
01:06:46.461 --> 01:06:48.922
And nobody is gonna hold
if they can't see what he's doing.

1305
01:06:51.633 --> 01:06:53.093
Close your eyes and count to three.

1306
01:06:53.802 --> 01:06:54.802
One.

1307
01:06:56.638 --> 01:06:57.638
- Two.
- Two.

1308
01:06:58.765 --> 01:06:59.766
- Three.
- Three.

1309
01:07:03.436 --> 01:07:05.479
Your phone's ringing.

1310
01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:07.690
This is the sound of the world.

1311
01:07:07.691 --> 01:07:09.400
Your phone is ringing!

1312
01:07:09.401 --> 01:07:13.530
Oh, Robinhood. Yeah. It's an app.

1313
01:07:14.114 --> 01:07:15.406
It's on the phone.

1314
01:07:15.407 --> 01:07:17.784
- Yeah, no, your phone is ringing.
- Oh.

1315
01:07:18.827 --> 01:07:21.120
Yes...

1317
01:07:23.999 --> 01:07:25.917
Slow down, Norm, what did you say?

1318
01:07:26.418 --> 01:07:30.838
The NSCC just sent us a file,
they want a deposit of 3 billion

1319
01:07:30.839 --> 01:07:32.549
to clear all the trades coming in.

1320
01:07:33.258 --> 01:07:34.550
Sorry.

1321
01:07:34.551 --> 01:07:35.634
Wait, who?

1322
01:07:35.635 --> 01:07:41.181
They're a subsidiary of the DTCC.
And they're requesting 3 billion.

1323
01:07:41.182 --> 01:07:46.146
Ah... Okay. Sorry, it's a little loud in
here. I thought you just said 3 billion.

1324
01:07:46.646 --> 01:07:47.689
<i>I did!</i>

1325
01:07:48.982 --> 01:07:51.692
- But we don't have 3 billion, Norm.
- That's correct.

1326
01:07:51.693 --> 01:07:54.738
<i>We've only ever raised 2 billion
in the history of the company.</i>

1327
01:07:55.613 --> 01:07:57.573
Holy fuck! What if we don't pay?

1328
01:07:57.574 --> 01:07:59.034
They shut us down.

1329
01:07:59.993 --> 01:08:02.995
The IPO, like, everything... poof.

1330
01:08:02.996 --> 01:08:05.874
Gretchen, Dan and I are going to
jump on a call with Citadel at 9.

1331
01:08:09.711 --> 01:08:12.755
Maybe this would be a good time
for me to chat with Ken Griffin.

1332
01:08:12.756 --> 01:08:15.467
<i>Sure. We'll mention that.</i>

1333
01:08:17.052 --> 01:08:18.344
I can't sleep.

1334
01:08:18.345 --> 01:08:19.387
Me neither.

1335
01:08:19.888 --> 01:08:21.181
I just feel sick!

1336
01:08:22.182 --> 01:08:23.767
We'll buy it back first thing.

1337
01:08:25.602 --> 01:08:27.020
Please shut up.

1338
01:08:41.868 --> 01:08:43.328
What the fuck.

1339
01:08:46.414 --> 01:08:47.540
Oh! What the fuck!

1340
01:08:48.583 --> 01:08:50.668
- What the fuck!
- Okay, let me try.

1341
01:08:51.753 --> 01:08:53.129
Is it frozen?

1342
01:08:58.385 --> 01:09:00.178
They cut off the buy option.

1343
01:09:00.887 --> 01:09:02.429
What?! That's fucking criminal.

1344
01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:03.722
I can't hear you, Baiju!

1345
01:09:03.723 --> 01:09:05.099
<i>What the fuck did you do?</i>

1346
01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:06.809
- Calm down.
- Me calm down?

1347
01:09:06.810 --> 01:09:08.394
You shut down trading on GameStop?

1348
01:09:08.395 --> 01:09:09.561
<i>Not all trading.</i>

1349
01:09:09.562 --> 01:09:10.729
Norm worked it out.

1350
01:09:10.730 --> 01:09:14.274
The DTCC agreed to lower the deposit
to 700 million

1351
01:09:14.275 --> 01:09:16.443
if we shut off buying,
and that's what I did.

1352
01:09:16.444 --> 01:09:18.487
<i>The Depository Trade Commission?</i>

1353
01:09:18.488 --> 01:09:20.739
<i>They're like one degree away
from Ken Griffin.</i>

1354
01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:22.950
One more time, Baiju.

1355
01:09:22.951 --> 01:09:23.952
Butt boys!

1356
01:09:25.954 --> 01:09:28.080
- What?
<i>- It's not going to be okay.</i>

1357
01:09:28.081 --> 01:09:29.331
You need to fix this...

1358
01:09:29.332 --> 01:09:30.959
Shh. I know, it's okay.

1359
01:09:31.835 --> 01:09:33.253
I did fix it, Baiju.

1360
01:09:35.463 --> 01:09:38.173
<i>We've been watching shares
of GameStop all day long</i>

1361
01:09:38.174 --> 01:09:41.844
<i>after hitting a staggering high of $483.</i>

1362
01:09:41.845 --> 01:09:44.805
<i>The shares are now down to about 140.</i>

1363
01:09:44.806 --> 01:09:47.766
<i>Now, the best we can tell
is the Robinhood app</i>

1364
01:09:47.767 --> 01:09:52.396
<i>that seems to have triggered what really
has become a panic sell-off in this name.</i>

1365
01:09:52.397 --> 01:09:57.025
<i>And so if you're a retail investor
or a Reddit user and you've held,</i>

1366
01:09:57.026 --> 01:09:59.779
<i>well, you are feeling some serious pain
right now.</i>

1367
01:10:00.989 --> 01:10:02.157
Oh God.

1368
01:10:03.616 --> 01:10:04.451
Fuck.

1369
01:10:04.452 --> 01:10:06.410
<i>Now the criticism centered on Robinhood</i>

1370
01:10:06.411 --> 01:10:10.372
<i>for abandoning their followers here
in favor of helping those who had shorted</i>

1371
01:10:10.373 --> 01:10:11.915
<i>all these stocks in the first place.</i>

1372
01:10:11.916 --> 01:10:14.376
<i>I don't particularly like the move
on Robinhood today.</i>

1373
01:10:14.377 --> 01:10:16.170
<i>I'm talking to people this morning
that say,</i>

1374
01:10:16.171 --> 01:10:18.046
<i>"Okay, that is anti-capitalism.</i>

1375
01:10:18.047 --> 01:10:19.548
<i>- You can't do that."</i>
- Fuck you, Robinhood!

1376
01:10:19.549 --> 01:10:24.261
<i>There's been some controversy
about Citadel and some vague accusations</i>

1377
01:10:24.262 --> 01:10:27.431
<i>that somehow Citadel may have been
involved in Robinhood's decision, Wolf,</i>

1378
01:10:27.432 --> 01:10:30.893
<i>to stop or restrict trading
in GameStop and other shorts...</i>

1379
01:10:30.894 --> 01:10:31.935
<i>Who is it from?</i>

1380
01:10:31.936 --> 01:10:34.731
The Tendieman...?

1381
01:10:36.608 --> 01:10:37.525
Come back inside.

1382
01:10:37.526 --> 01:10:39.068
Diamond fucking hands!

1383
01:10:41.237 --> 01:10:45.407
<i>We all know how I feel about him.
I think he's a rat, a liar.</i>

1384
01:10:45.408 --> 01:10:50.246
<i>Okay, Vlad, you know everybody here
who's watching us hates your guts, right?</i>

1385
01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:54.750
<i>Thank you, Dave, that's, uh...
that's what I hear.</i>

1386
01:10:54.751 --> 01:10:58.670
<i>But I'm a really big fan of your show
and hopefully I can answer</i>

1387
01:10:58.671 --> 01:11:00.797
<i>- some of your questions.
- Vlad, can you hear us?</i>

1388
01:11:00.798 --> 01:11:03.800
<i>- Vlad the stock impaler.</i>
- Yes, I'm here... Hi.

1389
01:11:03.801 --> 01:11:05.928
<i>Spill the beans, man,
what happened last week?</i>

1390
01:11:05.929 --> 01:11:08.722
<i>Why couldn't people buy GameStop shares?</i>

1391
01:11:08.723 --> 01:11:10.641
<i>The people demand an answer.</i>

1392
01:11:10.642 --> 01:11:14.186
<i>To give you some background,
I'm chief executive of Robinhood...</i>

1393
01:11:14.187 --> 01:11:15.521
<i>- Robbing executive.
- Yeah, we know that.</i>

1394
01:11:15.522 --> 01:11:17.189
And I just want to say,

1395
01:11:17.190 --> 01:11:19.858
- we had no liquidity problem<i>.
- Well, did something maybe shady</i>

1396
01:11:19.859 --> 01:11:21.693
<i>go down here?
Seems weird that you'd get a sudden</i>

1397
01:11:21.694 --> 01:11:23.820
<i>- 10 billion dollar demand... You know.</i>
- Three, 3 billion...

1398
01:11:23.821 --> 01:11:26.031
<i>- Okay, but 3 billion just suddenly,
- Yeah.</i>

1399
01:11:26.032 --> 01:11:28.116
<i>- Out of nowhere and...
- Well, I wouldn't impute</i>

1400
01:11:28.117 --> 01:11:31.245
<i>any shadiness to any of this, um...</i>

1401
01:11:31.246 --> 01:11:33.455
I don't have the full context, uh,

1402
01:11:33.456 --> 01:11:35.958
as to what was going on
with the NSCC to,

1403
01:11:35.959 --> 01:11:39.002
to, uh, make these calculations.

1404
01:11:39.003 --> 01:11:41.463
<i>To what degree
are you beholden to Citadel?</i>

1405
01:11:41.464 --> 01:11:44.841
<i>I mean, like, basically,
if Citadel is unhappy, then what happens?</i>

1406
01:11:44.842 --> 01:11:47.803
- <i>It was a hard temperance.
- Is anyone holding you hostage right now?</i>

1407
01:11:47.804 --> 01:11:48.721
<i>Uh, no.</i>

1408
01:11:48.722 --> 01:11:52.599
<i>There's just no rational explanation
on why they would do what they did</i>

1409
01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:55.310
<i>without outside pressure, interference.</i>

1410
01:11:55.311 --> 01:11:57.980
<i>And they basically cratered the stock
on purpose.</i>

1411
01:11:57.981 --> 01:12:01.024
<i>So, I just don't believe
anything that guy says.</i>

1412
01:12:01.025 --> 01:12:03.402
<i>I wanted to take a cold shower
after seeing him say that.</i>

1413
01:12:03.403 --> 01:12:06.071
<i>Robinhood is facing lawsuits,
we know that.</i>

1414
01:12:06.072 --> 01:12:08.448
<i>After halting trade, they are accused</i>

1415
01:12:08.449 --> 01:12:10.617
<i>- of rigging the market.
- When the big guys,</i>

1416
01:12:10.618 --> 01:12:13.870
<i>including one of your main investors
in your company started to lose,</i>

1417
01:12:13.871 --> 01:12:16.540
<i>you shut down the game
to starve the little guy.</i>

1418
01:12:16.541 --> 01:12:19.543
<i>They're stealing from the poor
and giving back to the rich.</i>

1419
01:12:19.544 --> 01:12:22.921
<i>They're robbing from the 'hood! Why?</i>

1420
01:12:22.922 --> 01:12:25.966
<i>- I want to be 100% clear,
- All of you guys deserve to burn in hell.</i>

1421
01:12:25.967 --> 01:12:27.342
<i>- This decision to...
- And go to jail.</i>

1422
01:12:27.343 --> 01:12:28.468
<i>Restrict trade was not made
on the direction</i>

1423
01:12:28.469 --> 01:12:29.720
<i>I'm just trying to get my mom
out the 'hood.</i>

1424
01:12:29.721 --> 01:12:32.514
<i>- Of Citadel or any market maker.
- What the fuck? Fuck you!</i>

1425
01:12:32.515 --> 01:12:33.932
<i>And your Mama Dukes,
you motherfucking fraud.</i>

1426
01:12:33.933 --> 01:12:34.933
<i>Fuck this guy.</i>

1427
01:12:35.727 --> 01:12:38.228
This guy is just
an obfuscating piece of shit.

1428
01:12:38.229 --> 01:12:39.521
Fucker.

1429
01:12:39.522 --> 01:12:41.857
There's only one man
I wanna hear from right now.

1430
01:12:41.858 --> 01:12:44.484
And Wall Street Bets is down,
so it's crickets.

1431
01:12:44.485 --> 01:12:46.070
It's crickets out here.

1432
01:12:46.946 --> 01:12:48.072
Say it with me.

1433
01:12:48.573 --> 01:12:50.575
- Where my pussy at!
- Where my pussy at!

1434
01:12:51.284 --> 01:12:52.827
- Mr. Gill!
- Mr. Gill!

1435
01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:57.456
- Roaring Kitty, I fucking love you!
- Keith Gill!

1436
01:12:57.457 --> 01:12:59.207
- Keith Gill, please!
- Okay.

1437
01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:02.336
- Please.
- Oh, sorry, this is, like, my house, uh...

1438
01:13:02.337 --> 01:13:03.921
- You want my autograph?
- Yeah.

1439
01:13:04.839 --> 01:13:05.839
You've been served.

1440
01:13:08.801 --> 01:13:11.637
Hey, to the moon, baby! To the moon.

1441
01:13:11.638 --> 01:13:12.846
Holy shit.

1442
01:13:17.769 --> 01:13:21.605
Sorry to interrupt. We need to talk
about the GameStop situation.

1443
01:13:21.606 --> 01:13:22.981
I thought Mecane was handling it.

1444
01:13:22.982 --> 01:13:25.817
So did we. But the committee's
specifically requested you, sir.

1445
01:13:25.818 --> 01:13:28.029
If they want specifics,
they can have Mecane.

1446
01:13:28.738 --> 01:13:30.657
It's not a choice, unfortunately.

1447
01:13:34.869 --> 01:13:36.120
Shitballs.

1448
01:13:38.915 --> 01:13:39.915
Keith?

1449
01:13:41.417 --> 01:13:44.503
- A congressional subpoena.
- I never did anything illegal.

1450
01:13:44.504 --> 01:13:45.963
And I always had disclaimers...

1451
01:13:46.631 --> 01:13:48.841
Why would you have disclaimers
if you weren't worried?

1452
01:13:49.384 --> 01:13:51.803
They're standard practice, Caroline,
everyone has them.

1453
01:13:56.808 --> 01:13:57.808
Babe...

1454
01:14:01.187 --> 01:14:03.731
- the answer is not in your computer.
- Whoa!

1455
01:14:04.357 --> 01:14:08.319
There's a dozen reporters on our lawn!
You have to testify before Congress.

1456
01:14:08.986 --> 01:14:11.738
- The game has changed.
- I know. I hear you.

1457
01:14:11.739 --> 01:14:13.157
I don't think you do.

1458
01:14:18.705 --> 01:14:20.123
Oh, my God. We're...

1459
01:14:21.666 --> 01:14:22.999
We're gonna go to my mother's.

1460
01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.168
No, she has terrible Wi-Fi.

1461
01:14:25.169 --> 01:14:27.212
I'm not talking about you.

1462
01:14:27.213 --> 01:14:29.090
I'm talking about me and her.

1463
01:14:29.841 --> 01:14:31.384
You need to figure this out.

1464
01:14:44.564 --> 01:14:46.440
- Where are you going?
- To the track.

1465
01:14:46.441 --> 01:14:48.775
- You were just on the track.
- I'm going again.

1466
01:14:59.287 --> 01:15:01.705
Hi. Can I interest you in
some champagne or a mimosa?

1467
01:15:01.706 --> 01:15:03.999
- Is it free?
- It is when you sit up here.

1468
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.001
Well, there is a last time for everything.

1469
01:15:06.002 --> 01:15:07.502
Oh, you'll be back.

1470
01:15:07.503 --> 01:15:11.758
I had half a million in stocks last week,
but Wall Street cheated.

1471
01:15:12.258 --> 01:15:13.426
Surprise, surprise.

1472
01:15:15.219 --> 01:15:16.471
I could have cashed out.

1473
01:15:17.597 --> 01:15:19.389
I could have paid my mortgage.

1474
01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:21.057
Could have gotten my kid braces.

1475
01:15:21.058 --> 01:15:21.976
Got a new car.

1476
01:15:21.977 --> 01:15:23.727
Honey, I'm gonna get you
something stronger.

1477
01:15:23.728 --> 01:15:25.229
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1478
01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:32.486
Meow!

1479
01:15:32.487 --> 01:15:33.612
Kitty!

1480
01:15:33.613 --> 01:15:36.323
You know you can't just eat other people's
food. They do reviews, right?

1481
01:15:36.324 --> 01:15:37.365
Very funny.

1482
01:15:37.366 --> 01:15:38.366
Here.

1483
01:15:38.868 --> 01:15:40.160
What's this?

1484
01:15:40.161 --> 01:15:41.620
Look, they were on sale, all right,

1485
01:15:41.621 --> 01:15:44.664
- before you get all emotional and shit.
- Holy shit, you fucking softy.

1486
01:15:44.665 --> 01:15:46.875
Who put you up to this? Caro? Ma?

1487
01:15:46.876 --> 01:15:48.668
No, Dad called me in tears,

1488
01:15:48.669 --> 01:15:50.504
said my big brother
needed some moral support.

1489
01:15:50.505 --> 01:15:52.964
Ah, fuck off. I can't.

1490
01:15:52.965 --> 01:15:55.050
C'mon, man.
Will you at least try 'em on? Please?

1491
01:15:55.051 --> 01:15:57.093
Try 'em. C'mon,
you're the richest man in Brockton,

1492
01:15:57.094 --> 01:15:59.679
- you dress like an asshole.
- I lost 15 million yesterday.

1493
01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:01.640
And another 15 the day before that.

1494
01:16:01.641 --> 01:16:04.018
You're still the richest man in Brockton,
like, by far.

1495
01:16:04.685 --> 01:16:08.522
Bro, you got rich dudes
pissing in their pants right now.

1496
01:16:08.523 --> 01:16:11.316
I mean, c'mon, man, how many people
from Brockton High can say that?

1497
01:16:11.317 --> 01:16:12.484
This has gone crazy,

1498
01:16:12.485 --> 01:16:15.320
I got reporters hounding me
outside my house.

1499
01:16:15.321 --> 01:16:17.448
Yeah, man, me too.
They're coming after you.

1500
01:16:19.033 --> 01:16:20.742
You didn't talk to them, did you?

1501
01:16:20.743 --> 01:16:24.079
What do I look like? I said no.
I said give me 50 grand maybe.

1502
01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:25.163
Tell me you're kidding.

1503
01:16:25.164 --> 01:16:27.833
Well, if you give me 20, then maybe
we wouldn't have to deal with this shit.

1504
01:16:27.834 --> 01:16:28.875
The fuck is wrong with you!?

1505
01:16:28.876 --> 01:16:32.295
Kevin, I've just been subpoenaed
by Congress, man.

1506
01:16:32.296 --> 01:16:33.964
I do not have time for your bullshit.

1507
01:16:33.965 --> 01:16:36.508
- Oh, come off it, man!
- Seriously, asshole.

1508
01:16:36.509 --> 01:16:38.469
- Chill! It was a joke!
- Fuck!

1509
01:16:46.394 --> 01:16:47.394
I know.

1510
01:16:48.062 --> 01:16:49.062
Sorry.

1511
01:16:56.028 --> 01:16:58.197
We never used to fight this much.

1512
01:17:01.117 --> 01:17:03.077
- Sara.
- I miss her.

1513
01:17:03.703 --> 01:17:04.703
Me too.

1514
01:17:05.162 --> 01:17:06.581
She kept your ego in check.

1515
01:17:07.248 --> 01:17:09.417
Whole fuckin' world kept my ego in check.

1516
01:17:10.501 --> 01:17:13.170
What the fuck are you gonna tell
Congress, Keith? Huh?

1517
01:17:14.255 --> 01:17:16.299
Beg them not to send me to prison?

1518
01:17:18.551 --> 01:17:19.551
Hey...

1519
01:17:20.136 --> 01:17:24.265
Hey, do you remember back at Stonehill
when they dared me to run that mile naked?

1520
01:17:24.765 --> 01:17:26.474
Yeah, there was a crazy storm that night.

1521
01:17:26.475 --> 01:17:28.184
- You dumb shit.
- Fuck you, man.

1522
01:17:28.185 --> 01:17:30.604
That was dope, man.
I'm a legend over there.

1523
01:17:30.605 --> 01:17:31.855
Everybody remembers that!

1524
01:17:31.856 --> 01:17:32.981
- Okay.
- They do, man.

1525
01:17:32.982 --> 01:17:35.025
You don't think people remember
your 4-minute 3-second mile?

1526
01:17:35.026 --> 01:17:36.985
Oh... what is this, a pep talk?

1527
01:17:36.986 --> 01:17:38.486
Motherfucker, stop hiding.

1528
01:17:38.487 --> 01:17:42.033
Seriously. Okay, stop being all meek
and shit and running away.

1529
01:17:42.867 --> 01:17:45.410
What, you want me to run through
lightning with my dick out?

1530
01:17:45.411 --> 01:17:46.411
Yeah.

1531
01:17:46.412 --> 01:17:48.581
Please, exactly that.

1532
01:17:49.290 --> 01:17:51.584
Run through lightning with your dick out.
Fuck it.

1533
01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:01.260
You didn't go to your mom's?

1534
01:18:03.179 --> 01:18:04.388
You took the car.

1535
01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:08.225
How was the run? Did it clear your head?

1536
01:18:09.018 --> 01:18:10.560
Kev found me, brought me these.

1537
01:18:10.561 --> 01:18:13.064
Hm. You guys talked?

1538
01:18:13.564 --> 01:18:16.317
Yup, he, uh, told me to run naked.

1539
01:18:16.817 --> 01:18:18.401
- You ran naked?
- No.

1540
01:18:18.402 --> 01:18:22.573
Uh, it's a metaphor. He's saying
I gotta take this thing head on.

1541
01:18:23.658 --> 01:18:24.658
Well...

1542
01:18:30.081 --> 01:18:31.666
I'd kinda like to see you run naked.

1543
01:18:35.294 --> 01:18:37.964
By the way, Wall Street Bets is back up.

1544
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:40.967
The motherfucker held.

1545
01:18:41.717 --> 01:18:46.097
Holy shit! He lost 30 million,
and he still fucking held.

1546
01:18:49.475 --> 01:18:51.185
- Robinhood's back up.
- What?

1547
01:18:51.978 --> 01:18:54.397
- We gotta get back in.
- Where's the stock at right now?

1548
01:18:55.147 --> 01:18:56.148
109.

1549
01:18:56.649 --> 01:18:57.692
Are you sure?

1550
01:18:58.192 --> 01:19:00.945
That's like all of the money
that we made back into the stock.

1551
01:19:04.824 --> 01:19:07.326
Yeah. We can't let them
get away with this.

1552
01:19:09.412 --> 01:19:10.412
Fuck 'em.

1553
01:19:10.830 --> 01:19:12.039
If he's in, I'm in.

1554
01:19:12.915 --> 01:19:14.125
If he's in, I'm in.

1555
01:19:17.628 --> 01:19:18.629
Okay.

1556
01:19:20.297 --> 01:19:21.297
Fuck!

1557
01:19:27.304 --> 01:19:31.933
<i>The frenzy continues with retail investors
bidding back up GameStop.</i>

1558
01:19:31.934 --> 01:19:34.102
<i>- Meme stock mania is back.
- up more than 80%</i>

1559
01:19:34.103 --> 01:19:36.646
<i>as those message board traders
simply sent it higher.</i>

1560
01:19:36.647 --> 01:19:38.314
<i>Stock volatility continuing,</i>

1561
01:19:38.315 --> 01:19:41.192

1562
01:19:41.193 --> 01:19:44.612
<i>an ongoing battle between
retail investors and short sellers.</i>

1563
01:19:44.613 --> 01:19:46.156
<i>We're gonna have a lot more
on this story.</i>

1564
01:19:46.157 --> 01:19:49.242
<i>CEOs of Robinhood, Reddit,
Citadel and Melvin Capital.</i>

1565
01:19:49.243 --> 01:19:52.662
<i>Along with Keith Gill,
better known as Roaring Kitty</i>

1566
01:19:52.663 --> 01:19:56.041
<i>on social media, will be in the hot seat.</i>

1567
01:20:00.504 --> 01:20:03.590
<i>I'm here testifying today
far removed from my background.</i>

1568
01:20:03.591 --> 01:20:06.676
<i>I grew up in a middle-class family
in Portland, Maine.</i>

1569
01:20:06.677 --> 01:20:08.344
My dad was a grocery store executive.

1570
01:20:08.345 --> 01:20:09.805
Maybe leave that part out.

1571
01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:12.223
The part about my dad?

1572
01:20:12.224 --> 01:20:13.349
The executive part.

1573
01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:14.935
Okay... okay.

1574
01:20:18.272 --> 01:20:22.734
I went to a public high school.
I studied hard and got into Northwestern.

1575
01:20:22.735 --> 01:20:24.819
- Just say "a good college."
- Upon...

1576
01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:26.404
I can't say I went to Northwestern?

1577
01:20:26.405 --> 01:20:28.282
- Too elite.
- Northwestern's too...

1578
01:20:28.949 --> 01:20:29.949
All right.

1579
01:20:33.788 --> 01:20:38.374
Upon graduation, I did not have a job.
Today, I'm married with four children.

1580
01:20:38.375 --> 01:20:40.628
Gabe, where do you plan on
doing your testimony?

1581
01:20:43.005 --> 01:20:45.758
- Here.
- In front of your wine collection?

1582
01:20:47.802 --> 01:20:50.970
I mean, this is... I don't have that big
of a wine collection honestly.

1583
01:20:50.971 --> 01:20:52.013
Yeah, it's huge.

1584
01:20:52.014 --> 01:20:53.932
Digital risks seem to be overblown.

1585
01:20:53.933 --> 01:20:56.434
Two, the negative sentiment is overdone.

1586
01:20:56.435 --> 01:21:00.231
- Three, the value...
- Maybe... here would be nice.

1587
01:21:03.526 --> 01:21:05.527
- Too many windows.
- Too many windows... Oh.

1588
01:21:05.528 --> 01:21:06.694
It's very bright.

1589
01:21:06.695 --> 01:21:09.864
- Yeah, ocean front's not a great idea.
- It's blue.

1590
01:21:09.865 --> 01:21:11.616
Yeah. Okay, I hadn't thought of that.

1591
01:21:11.617 --> 01:21:14.536
That, uh, yeah, downstairs there's more...
there's probably darker rooms.

1592
01:21:14.537 --> 01:21:16.704
<i>What a bandit.
Most of you know this guy,</i>

1593
01:21:16.705 --> 01:21:18.331
<i>who is the Roaring Kitty character,</i>

1594
01:21:18.332 --> 01:21:19.791
- <i>who was really pushing it.</i>
- Holy shit.

1595
01:21:19.792 --> 01:21:21.835
- <i>You know, voicing the information.</i>
- Yo, Riri, our boy's on the news.

1596
01:21:21.836 --> 01:21:23.753
<i>And what's the potentially systemic risk?</i>

1597
01:21:23.754 --> 01:21:26.089
<i>Those relationships in D.C. are strong.</i>

1598
01:21:26.090 --> 01:21:30.218
<i>The guys who run those hedge funds are
the guys who fund presidential campaigns.</i>

1599
01:21:30.219 --> 01:21:32.178
<i>- You know Roaring Kitties don't have
- That's a good point.</i>

1600
01:21:32.179 --> 01:21:33.596
<i>- That kind of influence,
- Gill is now being sued</i>

1601
01:21:33.597 --> 01:21:34.681
<i>- but the hedge fund managers do.
- For securities fraud</i>

1602
01:21:34.682 --> 01:21:37.016
<i>over his alleged role
in the GameStop rally.</i>

1603
01:21:37.017 --> 01:21:39.894
<i>Is Mr. Gill likely to appear,
and if he appears,</i>

1604
01:21:39.895 --> 01:21:44.065
<i>is he likely to talk
if he faces the potential of prosecution?</i>

1605
01:21:44.066 --> 01:21:49.070
Fundamentals are based on three things:
One, digital risks are overblown.

1606
01:21:49.071 --> 01:21:50.989
Two, the negative sentiment is overdone.

1607
01:21:50.990 --> 01:21:52.199
And three...

1608
01:21:55.911 --> 01:21:56.745
Fuck.

1609
01:21:56.746 --> 01:21:58.955
- Ah, c'mon, shut up.
- I know all this.

1610
01:22:00.374 --> 01:22:02.876
You guys, you guys, stop.
Stop, let's keep going.

1611
01:22:02.877 --> 01:22:04.002
All right, let's go again.

1612
01:22:04.003 --> 01:22:06.337
You're right, this is serious.
You can go to jail forever.

1613
01:22:06.338 --> 01:22:07.964
- A long time. Long, long time.
- All right. You ready?

1614
01:22:07.965 --> 01:22:09.924
You ready here we go. Back in the game.

1615
01:22:09.925 --> 01:22:13.094
- Mr. Gill. May I call you Mr. Gill, sir?
- It's my name.

1616
01:22:13.095 --> 01:22:15.597
Why the fuck wouldn't you be able
to call him Mr. Gill?

1617
01:22:15.598 --> 01:22:17.557
What were your intentions
with the YouTube videos

1618
01:22:17.558 --> 01:22:19.184
and your social media posts on GameStop?

1619
01:22:19.185 --> 01:22:20.768
- Yes.
- Thank you, congresswoman.

1620
01:22:20.769 --> 01:22:22.270
You're welcome.

1621
01:22:22.271 --> 01:22:24.397
I developed a theory
that the company was undervalued

1622
01:22:24.398 --> 01:22:26.191
despite the significant short interest.

1623
01:22:26.192 --> 01:22:28.193
Oh, so you were aware
of the short interest.

1624
01:22:28.194 --> 01:22:30.778
It is public knowledge.
You can see it in the SEC filings.

1625
01:22:30.779 --> 01:22:33.114
And your goal
was to break these shorts, yes?

1626
01:22:33.115 --> 01:22:36.743
To rally an online mob to artificially
push the price of GameStop soaring,

1627
01:22:36.744 --> 01:22:39.871
ah, "to the moon" as they say,
isn't that correct, Mr. Gill?

1628
01:22:39.872 --> 01:22:41.831
Objection, objection,
you're leading the witness.

1629
01:22:41.832 --> 01:22:42.916
- Kev...
- Witness.

1630
01:22:42.917 --> 01:22:44.375
I yield my time to the chair.

1631
01:22:44.376 --> 01:22:46.836
You were hoping for the short squeeze,
weren't you, Mr. Gill?

1632
01:22:46.837 --> 01:22:48.004
You short squeezing bastard.

1633
01:22:48.005 --> 01:22:50.089
The short squeeze
was a marginal point of the thesis.

1634
01:22:50.090 --> 01:22:52.258
Then why did you talk about it
in your videos all the time?

1635
01:22:52.259 --> 01:22:54.093
You did talk about it in your videos.
You talked about it a lot.

1636
01:22:54.094 --> 01:22:55.637
- You remember about the squeeze.
- Exactly.

1637
01:22:55.638 --> 01:22:56.846
You were like
"It's just a little squeeze."

1638
01:22:56.847 --> 01:22:57.847
Exactly.

1639
01:22:57.848 --> 01:23:00.391
Are you really asking us to believe
that you weren't a leader

1640
01:23:00.392 --> 01:23:02.602
- to all these retail traders?
- You're fucked, buddy.

1641
01:23:02.603 --> 01:23:04.771
- My point of view...
- Asking. Yes or no?

1642
01:23:04.772 --> 01:23:06.272
- Yes or no?
- Yes. So yes.

1643
01:23:06.273 --> 01:23:07.482
- Yes or no?
- You are admitting it. Yes.

1644
01:23:07.483 --> 01:23:08.900
Remember you with a cheap bottle
of champagne.

1645
01:23:08.901 --> 01:23:10.109
At any moment... Kevin!

1646
01:23:10.110 --> 01:23:11.152
- Kevin!
- Dunking ten dies like a fucking...

1647
01:23:11.153 --> 01:23:12.153
What?

1648
01:23:13.364 --> 01:23:15.741
I'm running with my dick out.

1649
01:23:16.825 --> 01:23:18.201
Okay, why don't you just say that?

1650
01:23:18.202 --> 01:23:19.578
Okay, I'll stop.

1651
01:23:20.371 --> 01:23:25.250
All right. Mr. Gill, what exactly
about the fundamentals

1652
01:23:25.251 --> 01:23:28.544
- led you to build this bull case?
- What the fuck's with the voice?

1653
01:23:28.545 --> 01:23:30.880
I don't know, I was trying to do AOC,
but it was flat.

1654
01:23:30.881 --> 01:23:32.173
I don't even think she's on the panel.

1655
01:23:32.174 --> 01:23:33.383
You shut the fuck up, Briggsy.

1656
01:23:33.384 --> 01:23:34.759
- I'll slap the shit out of you.
- Is she on that panel?

1657
01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:35.678
- I swear to God.
- You're gonna slap me?

1658
01:23:35.679 --> 01:23:37.053
- Yeah, let's go.
- You ready to go?

1659
01:23:37.054 --> 01:23:39.723
<i>- Let's go.
- I've been waiting for this, dog.</i>

1660
01:23:57.157 --> 01:23:58.157
Come here.

1661
01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:08.711
You're gonna be great.

1662
01:24:09.962 --> 01:24:12.672
If it goes bad, it's gonna be real bad.

1663
01:24:12.673 --> 01:24:14.465
Well, don't let it go bad.

1664
01:24:14.466 --> 01:24:18.720
<i>This hearing will be first
in a series of hearings by the committee</i>

1665
01:24:18.721 --> 01:24:23.808
<i>to examine the recent market volatility
involving GameStop.</i>

1666
01:24:23.809 --> 01:24:28.396
<i>I want to know how each
of the witnesses here today</i>

1667
01:24:28.397 --> 01:24:30.565
- <i>contributed to the historic...</i>
- Gabe, can you sit up?

1668
01:24:30.566 --> 01:24:33.736
<i>Trading events in January.</i>

1669
01:24:34.278 --> 01:24:36.529
<i>This recent market volatility</i>

1670
01:24:36.530 --> 01:24:41.117
<i>has put a national spotlight
on institutional practices</i>

1671
01:24:41.118 --> 01:24:42.785
<i>by Wall Street firms.</i>

1672
01:24:42.786 --> 01:24:46.456
<i>And they have demonstrated
the enormous potential power</i>

1673
01:24:46.457 --> 01:24:49.168
<i>of social media in our markets.</i>

1674
01:24:49.752 --> 01:24:53.297
<i>We will hear firsthand from the witnesses
regarding these events.</i>

1675
01:24:53.922 --> 01:24:58.092
<i>The hearing will be an opportunity
for this committee to get the facts</i>

1676
01:24:58.093 --> 01:25:01.346
<i>about the role
each of the witnesses represent,</i>

1677
01:25:01.347 --> 01:25:04.974
<i>played in the events
we are examining today.</i>

1678
01:25:04.975 --> 01:25:07.435
<i>Well, now, Mr. Griffin,
if I could ask you this first question.</i>

1679
01:25:07.436 --> 01:25:08.354
Of course.

1680
01:25:08.355 --> 01:25:10.522
<i>How many people
are in the room with you?</i>

1681
01:25:11.398 --> 01:25:12.440
That's your question?

1682
01:25:12.441 --> 01:25:14.921
<i>If you can just count how many
people are in the room with you.</i>

1683
01:25:19.156 --> 01:25:22.658
<i>There are five people,
including myself, in this room.</i>

1684
01:25:22.659 --> 01:25:24.327
- <i>Anyone in your organization...</i>
- Such a prick.

1685
01:25:24.328 --> 01:25:26.537
<i>Since January 1st, contact Robinhood?</i>

1686
01:25:26.538 --> 01:25:31.376
We of course talk to Robinhood routinely
in the ordinary course of business.

1687
01:25:31.377 --> 01:25:33.711
We manage a substantial portion
of their order flow.

1688
01:25:33.712 --> 01:25:36.089
<i>But did you talk to them about restricting</i>

1689
01:25:36.090 --> 01:25:40.301
<i>or doing anything to prevent people
from buying GameStop?</i>

1690
01:25:40.302 --> 01:25:43.096
I want to be perfectly clear.

1691
01:25:43.097 --> 01:25:46.808
<i>We had no role in Robinhood's decision</i>

1692
01:25:46.809 --> 01:25:49.060
- <i>to limit trading in GameStop.</i>
- Fuck you, Ken Griffin.

1693
01:25:49.061 --> 01:25:52.940
<i>So, if we depose everyone
in your organization, we would find that?</i>

1694
01:25:53.607 --> 01:25:54.525
That is correct.

1695
01:25:54.526 --> 01:25:57.151
Looks like a Disney Channel villain.

1696
01:25:57.152 --> 01:26:01.739
<i>Mr. Plotkin, do you believe
that there is manipulation, distrust,</i>

1697
01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:04.659
<i>and overall inequality
within American finance?</i>

1698
01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:06.828
My focus is on my company, Melvin...

1699
01:26:08.497 --> 01:26:09.664
Hello?

1700
01:26:09.665 --> 01:26:11.374
You're on mute, dick!

1701
01:26:11.375 --> 01:26:13.001
<i>Ah, I'm sorry, you're on mute.</i>

1702
01:26:17.214 --> 01:26:18.881
He just keeps going.

1703
01:26:18.882 --> 01:26:20.716
My area of expertise.

1704
01:26:20.717 --> 01:26:24.470
<i>You're still on mute. I haven't been able
to hear a word you said, unfortunately.</i>

1705
01:26:24.471 --> 01:26:26.848
<i>Mr. Tenev,
would you be willing to commit today</i>

1706
01:26:26.849 --> 01:26:29.016
<i>- to voluntarily pass on the proceeds...</i>
- Oh. Marry me.

1707
01:26:29.017 --> 01:26:31.811
<i>Of the payment for order flow
to Robinhood customers?</i>

1708
01:26:31.812 --> 01:26:34.355
Congresswoman, I appreciate that question.

1709
01:26:34.356 --> 01:26:38.568
When the statement you refer to was made,
it was before Robinhood forced

1710
01:26:38.569 --> 01:26:40.570
the entire industry to drop

1711
01:26:40.571 --> 01:26:42.280
- commissions and replicate our...
<i>- I should take that as a no.</i>

1712
01:26:42.281 --> 01:26:45.116
<i>You're not willing to pass on
the proceeds of payment for order flow</i>

1713
01:26:45.117 --> 01:26:46.076
<i>to your customers?</i>

1714
01:26:46.077 --> 01:26:48.786
- When the other brokers drop...
- <i>I'm just talking about today.</i>

1715
01:26:48.787 --> 01:26:49.996
- Asshole.
- <i>I don't want to be rude.</i>

1716
01:26:49.997 --> 01:26:51.372
<i>I just have limited time,</i>

1717
01:26:51.373 --> 01:26:55.376
<i>but if removing the revenues that you make
from a payment for order flow</i>

1718
01:26:55.377 --> 01:26:58.880
<i>would cause the removal
of free commissions,</i>

1719
01:26:58.881 --> 01:27:00.673
<i>doesn't that mean that
trading on Robinhood</i>

1720
01:27:00.674 --> 01:27:02.633
<i>isn't actually free to begin with?</i>

1721
01:27:02.634 --> 01:27:04.011
Good question.

1722
01:27:10.642 --> 01:27:12.894
<i>Thank you very much, Mr. Gill.</i>

1723
01:27:12.895 --> 01:27:17.524
<i>You are now recognized for five minutes
to present your oral testimony.</i>

1724
01:27:29.453 --> 01:27:31.914
Thank you, members of the committee.

1725
01:27:34.458 --> 01:27:37.753
I am happy to discuss my purchase
of GameStop shares

1726
01:27:38.337 --> 01:27:41.715
and my discussions of their fair value
on social media.

1727
01:27:42.549 --> 01:27:44.175
But before I do that,

1728
01:27:44.176 --> 01:27:46.094
a few things I am not:

1729
01:27:47.888 --> 01:27:49.097
I am not a cat.

1730
01:27:50.641 --> 01:27:52.892
- What did he say?
- He just said cat, Ma.

1731
01:27:52.893 --> 01:27:54.185
It's like a kitty thing.

1732
01:27:54.186 --> 01:27:56.604
<i>Nor am I a hedge fund.
I do not have clients,</i>

1733
01:27:56.605 --> 01:28:01.943
<i>and I do not provide personalized
investment advice for fees or commissions.</i>

1734
01:28:01.944 --> 01:28:04.029
I grew up in Brockton, Mass.

1735
01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:06.656
My family was not wealthy.

1736
01:28:06.657 --> 01:28:09.992
<i>My father was a truck driver
and my mom a registered nurse.</i>

1737
01:28:09.993 --> 01:28:12.203
- That's you, Ma!
- I was one of three kids

1738
01:28:12.204 --> 01:28:15.289
and the first in my family
to earn a four-year college degree

1739
01:28:15.290 --> 01:28:19.460
when I graduated from Stonehill College
in 2009.

1740
01:28:19.461 --> 01:28:21.587
<i>That was not a good time
to be looking for a job.</i>

1741
01:28:21.588 --> 01:28:24.090
<i>From 2010-2017,</i>

1742
01:28:24.091 --> 01:28:27.552
<i>there were significant periods
when I was unemployed.</i>

1743
01:28:27.553 --> 01:28:29.929
<i>I took an interest in the stock market,</i>

1744
01:28:29.930 --> 01:28:32.223
and even though I had very little money,

1745
01:28:32.224 --> 01:28:36.435
I used those times to educate myself
and learn more about investing.

1746
01:28:36.436 --> 01:28:40.398
<i>Mr. Gill, I find it hard to believe
that you predicted everything</i>

1747
01:28:40.399 --> 01:28:44.068
<i>that happened to GameStop
with no inside information.</i>

1748
01:28:44.069 --> 01:28:45.820
Uh, I didn't predict it.

1749
01:28:45.821 --> 01:28:49.198
I honestly couldn't explain everything
that happened in January.

1750
01:28:49.199 --> 01:28:53.035
<i>I've seen your videos. You honestly
couldn't recount to the committee</i>

1751
01:28:53.036 --> 01:28:57.624
<i>what caused every single up and down
of the stock in January?</i>

1752
01:28:58.208 --> 01:28:59.334
<i>I think you could.</i>

1753
01:29:00.669 --> 01:29:04.046
I did follow the stock, uh, very closely,

1754
01:29:04.047 --> 01:29:07.675
but threshold lists, order flows,
halting purchases, according to the press,

1755
01:29:07.676 --> 01:29:09.635
these all had a material impact
on the stock.

1756
01:29:09.636 --> 01:29:12.305
Here's the thing: I have
a bit of experience with this stuff,

1757
01:29:12.306 --> 01:29:14.307
and even I barely understand
these matters.

1758
01:29:14.308 --> 01:29:18.185
It's alarming how little we all know
about the inner workings of the market.

1759
01:29:18.186 --> 01:29:20.896
Which is why I'm glad this committee
is examining what happened,

1760
01:29:20.897 --> 01:29:23.691
particularly with the exorbitant
short interest

1761
01:29:23.692 --> 01:29:26.652
as well as any potentially
manipulative shorting practices

1762
01:29:26.653 --> 01:29:30.823
and brokers' reported failures to
timely deliver shares and settle trades.

1763
01:29:34.119 --> 01:29:36.329
A lot of people feel the system is broken.

1764
01:29:36.330 --> 01:29:40.416
<i>The whole idea of the stock market is to
be, like, kind of a fair playing field,</i>

1765
01:29:40.417 --> 01:29:44.338
<i>where if you're smart, maybe with a little
luck, you could make your fortune.</i>

1766
01:29:45.130 --> 01:29:47.466
<i>But, if it ever was that,
it's certainly not any more.</i>

1767
01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:51.886
The big firms have such a big advantage,
in terms of technology and information

1768
01:29:51.887 --> 01:29:55.223
and just sheer wealth, there's no hope
for the little guy anymore.

1769
01:29:55.974 --> 01:29:57.851
<i>Or there was no hope.</i>

1770
01:29:58.602 --> 01:30:00.646
<i>Maybe now, there is.</i>

1771
01:30:02.814 --> 01:30:04.274
And as for me,

1772
01:30:04.983 --> 01:30:06.150
I like the stock.

1773
01:30:07.152 --> 01:30:09.612
He's a gangster for that.

1774
01:30:09.613 --> 01:30:11.322
I don't plan on selling any time soon.

1775
01:30:11.323 --> 01:30:13.032
- Hold it.
- Say that shit.

1776
01:30:13.033 --> 01:30:14.075
Diamond fucking hands.

1777
01:30:14.076 --> 01:30:15.077
Diamond hands, baby.

1778
01:30:16.203 --> 01:30:17.745
Attaboy.

1779
01:30:17.746 --> 01:30:19.122
What a nerd.

1780
01:30:19.748 --> 01:30:20.748
Thank you.

1781
01:30:28.340 --> 01:30:30.759
It was good. I think.

You're a fucking gangster.

1799
01:32:19.618 --> 01:32:22.119
Hey, man, I notice you've been
selling a lot of new games,

1800
01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:25.414
and I just wanted to remind you, again,
that we really wanna be pushing customers

1801
01:32:25.415 --> 01:32:28.001
towards the higher-margin pre-owned games.

1802
01:32:29.044 --> 01:32:31.003
Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.

1803
01:32:31.004 --> 01:32:31.922
Excuse me?

1804
01:32:31.923 --> 01:32:34.632
Oh, and in fact, I'm not gonna do
any of the Circle of Life bullshit.

1805
01:32:34.633 --> 01:32:36.091
Or your TikTok dance contest.

1806
01:32:36.092 --> 01:32:37.177
You're quitting, then.

1807
01:32:39.137 --> 01:32:40.137
Okay.

1808
01:32:40.138 --> 01:32:41.973
No, I mean, I thought about it, but...

1809
01:32:42.974 --> 01:32:44.767
Like, yo, I love it here.

1810
01:32:44.768 --> 01:32:46.519

1811
01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:50.065
Well, you're awfully smug for a kid
who lost all his money buying stock.

1812
01:32:50.565 --> 01:32:52.984
What did you say it was going to?
A thousand?

1813
01:32:54.236 --> 01:32:56.738
I'm also not gonna work
at the ass crack of dawn any more.

1814
01:32:57.864 --> 01:32:58.864
You're fired.

1815
01:33:00.659 --> 01:33:01.909
No, I'm not.

1816

Half.
