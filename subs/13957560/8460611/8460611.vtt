but he'll put 50k in a stock
that you think is a joke.

169
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.825
And that's interesting to you?

170
00:08:12.701 --> 00:08:13.785
Yeah.

171
00:08:14.995 --> 00:08:16.121
It is.

172
00:08:22.085 --> 00:08:23.670

[Keith] Hey!

176
00:08:34.097 --> 00:08:35.223
[woman] Hey!

177
00:08:37.642 --> 00:08:39.186

00:08:39.186 --> 00:08:42.564
Yeah, she was exhausted.
She skipped her nap.

179
00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:45.901
- How was Briggsy?
- Uh...

180
00:08:45.901 --> 00:08:47.360
Good. Yeah.

181
00:08:50.989 --> 00:08:52.699

182

183
00:08:59.331 --> 00:09:00.290
[Keith] Uh...

184
00:09:03.835 --> 00:09:05.504
Do you wanna sit down a minute?

185
00:09:05.504 --> 00:09:07.672
I'll feel better if I finish these first.

186
00:09:07.672 --> 00:09:08.632

187
00:09:08.632 --> 00:09:10.884
[Caroline] No, you won't.

188
00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:37.285
Do you think I'm insane?

189
00:09:37.285 --> 00:09:38.620
Yeah.

190
00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:41.540
Sorry. About what?

191
00:09:42.707 --> 00:09:43.834
GameStop.

192
00:09:43.834 --> 00:09:46.586
The most compelling
asymmetric opportunity in the market?

193
00:09:48.713 --> 00:09:51.007
- What, did Briggsy make you jumpy?
- A little.

194
00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:53.134
- What was his argument?
- He didn't have one.

195
00:09:53.134 --> 00:09:55.720
- Well.
- He just said it was a reckless bet.

196
00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.098
He said "you're putting your money
in the next Blockbuster."

197
00:09:58.098 --> 00:09:59.015
Enough. Fuck Briggsy.

198
00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:02.394
Babe, you literally know more about
this damn company than you know about me.

199
00:10:02.853 --> 00:10:03.770
It's true.

200
00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:06.773
And because of you, I know more about
this company than I know about myself.

201
00:10:06.773 --> 00:10:10.569
But what if I'm missing something?
We can't afford to miss something.

202

205
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.787
Go see what the nerds have to say.

206
00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:23.456
Our Wall Street Bets people
aren't nerds, Caroline.

207
00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:25.959
They're gangsters.
You make a dumb case and post it,

208
00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:28.378
- they'll rip you apart.
- Well, then don't make a dumb case.

00:10:47.522 --> 00:10:49.024
Okay, let's see what's new.

211

Oh, there's a share. Okay, here we go.

212
00:10:56.948 --> 00:10:58.241
Oh shit.

213
00:11:21.598 --> 00:11:23.058
All right...

214
00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.436
Just check on... See here.

215

Yo, what up, everybody?
Roaring Kitty here.

216
00:11:39.491 --> 00:11:42.619
Uh, I've done a few of these now,
mostly on my investing methodology.

217
00:11:42.619 --> 00:11:45.455
Uh, but today I'm gonna try something
a little different.

218
00:11:45.455 --> 00:11:48.875
I appreciate the feedback
you guys have been leaving me by the way.

219
00:11:48.875 --> 00:11:52.545
Uh... Oh! More feedback comin' in hot.

220
00:11:52.545 --> 00:11:56.341
"Less cats." Okay. Great.

221
00:11:56.341 --> 00:11:59.970
Ah, like I was saying--
Uh, what was I saying?

222
00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:00.929
Ah, I'm gonna try...

223
00:12:00.929 --> 00:12:03.139
Oh, and here's one from Ballz.

224
00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:04.641
"Nerd."

225
00:12:04.641 --> 00:12:06.643
And nerd is in all capitals.

226
00:12:06.643 --> 00:12:10.689
Like, okay, that's kinda mean.
But okay, fair.

227
00:12:10.689 --> 00:12:11.773
Uh...

228
00:12:11.773 --> 00:12:13.775
"Nice shirt, Grandpa"?

229
00:12:13.775 --> 00:12:17.070
What? How old do you think I am?

230
00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:18.029
You know what?

231
00:12:18.029 --> 00:12:21.157
Thanks for the comments.
We're gonna come back to them at the end.

232
00:12:21.157 --> 00:12:22.450
Here's what I wanna talk about.

233
00:12:23.326 --> 00:12:26.579
Uh, I'm gonna pick a stock and
talk about why I think it's interesting.

234
00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:28.540
And that stock is...

235
00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.960
GameStop. Uh...

236
00:12:32.752 --> 00:12:34.129
I know it's a polarizing stock

237
00:12:34.129 --> 00:12:36.631
and some of you probably gonna
tune out of the stream right now

238
00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:39.134
when you hear I'm bullish on GameStop.
But I am.

239
00:12:39.134 --> 00:12:43.221
You can see it is now the biggest position
by far in the Roaring Kitty portfolio.

240
00:12:43.221 --> 00:12:44.139
So...

241
00:12:44.139 --> 00:12:47.183
yeah, I think everyone else is crazy,
and I think I'm right.

242
00:12:47.183 --> 00:12:51.730
But I've been wrong plenty of times
in the past. So, uh...

243
00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:55.275
<i>So there are a lot of aspects to this
bold thesis, a lot of moving parts,</i>

244
00:12:55.275 --> 00:12:57.777
<i>but I boil it down
to what I consider the three overs:</i>

245
00:12:57.777 --> 00:13:00.113
The digital risks seem to me
to be overblown,

246
00:13:00.113 --> 00:13:01.573
the negative sentiment is overdone,

247
00:13:01.573 --> 00:13:03.324
you can see it
with the huge short interest,

248
00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:05.243
and the value is overlooked.

249
00:13:05.243 --> 00:13:07.412
Wall Street just doesn't see it.

250
00:13:08.038 --> 00:13:09.205
Why?

251
00:13:09.205 --> 00:13:12.459
Mr. Market, why?

<i>The hedge funds are overlooking
the value in the company</i>

253
00:13:15.962 --> 00:13:18.673
<i>just like they overlook
the people who shop there.</i>

<i>They assume most people download
games online now.</i>

255

still buy new discs from GameStop,</i>

Hey, Jenny, for real,

273

I wouldn't take investment advice
from a guy in a cat shirt.

Oh, okay.
Who do you take investment advice from?

275
00:14:10.141 --> 00:14:16.815
I don't have investments. And if I did,
I'd listen to, like, a banker.

276
00:14:16.815 --> 00:14:18.316
Just the way they like it.

No, no, no, please tell me.

from <i>The Royal Tenenbaums</i>

with our $68,000 a year.

[Jenny] Okay, fine.

285
00:14:34.124 --> 00:14:37.043
Wall Street is betting
that this company is gonna fail.

286
00:14:37.043 --> 00:14:38.628
It's called shorting.

287
00:14:38.628 --> 00:14:42.215
And if it fails, well,
then everybody loses their job,

288
00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:44.884
but these hedge fund assholes
make a shit ton of money.

for rich people to get richer.

- It's an Internet forum.

- On Reddit.
- Now, see. No, no.

00:15:03.027 --> 00:15:05.405
I'm not gonna do this with you.

a delta squeeze and a gamma squeeze.

And you're never gonna date Puff Daddy.

313
00:15:45.987 --> 00:15:48.406
First of all, no one has said Puff Daddy
since the '90s

314
00:15:48.406 --> 00:15:50.783
and second of all, this isn't Puff Daddy.

315
00:15:51.576 --> 00:15:52.744
This is Loop Daddy.

316

he's weird looking.

in rural Virginia with a name like

671
00:33:08.654 --> 00:33:11.698
Baiju Prafulkumar Bhatt? [laughs]

672
00:33:11.698 --> 00:33:15.035
We created commission-free trading
so that anyone can get in the game.

673
00:33:15.035 --> 00:33:18.580
You don't even need a bank account.
People have really responded.

674
00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:22.542
We've added 5 million users,
uh, in the last six months,

675
00:33:22.542 --> 00:33:25.379
- for a total of, um...
- Close to 20 at this point. Million.

676
00:33:25.379 --> 00:33:27.214
[Nat]
So, you're one of these tech companies

677
00:33:27.214 --> 00:33:29.549
that's exploded growth-wise,
but doesn't make any money.

678
00:33:29.549 --> 00:33:31.385
- We make money.
- [Nat] But how?

679
00:33:31.385 --> 00:33:34.388
- If you don't charge commission then...
- From interest on people's accounts.

680
00:33:34.388 --> 00:33:35.973
[Nat] But your users are mostly young.

681
00:33:35.973 --> 00:33:38.767
So, how much money can they
really be keeping in their account?

682
00:33:38.767 --> 00:33:40.394
There's also payment for order flow.

683
00:33:40.394 --> 00:33:41.311
What's that?

684
00:33:41.311 --> 00:33:44.189
We prefer the term "stock order routing."

685
00:33:44.189 --> 00:33:46.149
When you buy or sell a stock on our app,

686
00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:48.944
we send your order to market makers,
who process the order.

687
00:33:48.944 --> 00:33:51.321
They pay us a tiny rebate on every trade.

688
00:33:51.321 --> 00:33:53.115
- Tiny.
- But it adds up.

689
00:33:53.115 --> 00:33:55.450
We should really get back to how we...
started our company.

690
00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:56.952
What market maker do you work with?

691
00:33:56.952 --> 00:33:59.246
A few. Citadel Securities mostly.

692
00:33:59.246 --> 00:34:01.623
Ken Griffin's firm?
Isn't that a hedge fund?

693
00:34:01.623 --> 00:34:05.210
Well, Ken Griffin's hedge fund
is called Citadel.

694
00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:07.879
But Citadel Securities
is a completely different company.

695
00:34:07.879 --> 00:34:09.673
Also owned by Ken Griffin?

696
00:34:11.091 --> 00:34:12.175

You need to get out while you can.

- Don't be an idiot.
- You remember red headband guy.

904

He's worth 11 million dollars.
And he's not selling.

- No fucking way.
- [Jenny] Yes fucking way.

906
00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.828
This is what I'm telling you.
Diamond hands.

907
00:44:24.996 --> 00:44:28.541
Diamond hands. You hold the line
no matter what the market does.

908
00:44:28.541 --> 00:44:29.959
No matter what Wall Street says.

909
00:44:29.959 --> 00:44:32.003
What happens
when everyone else sells first,

910
00:44:32.003 --> 00:44:34.756

you've lost all your money?

911
00:44:34.756 --> 00:44:36.507

- [man] Anyone?

913
00:44:38.384 --> 00:44:40.595
- [Jenny] We're gonna hold the line.
- [woman] C'mon.

914
00:44:40.595 --> 00:44:42.722
- Someone has to go first.
- Okay, yeah. I'll do it.

<i>Fuck! Guys, we need your help.
What should we do?</i>

920
00:45:00.823 --> 00:45:04.661
So listen, my girl bought in under 20
and now it is over 60.

921
00:45:04.661 --> 00:45:06.579
So like, should she sell?

922
00:45:06.579 --> 00:45:08.873
On the one hand, she has principles.

923
00:45:09.916 --> 00:45:13.294
On the other,
she has 100k in student debt. So...

924
00:45:13.294 --> 00:45:16.047
One way you could think
about the comparison between

925
00:45:16.047 --> 00:45:18.675
Marxism and Utilitarian tradition

926
00:45:18.675 --> 00:45:22.387
is that they both have a micro story
and a macro story.

927
00:45:22.387 --> 00:45:24.764
When you think of Utilitarian tradition...

928
00:45:24.764 --> 00:45:29.185
The only thing that would convince her
to sell is if Roaring Kitty sold.

929
00:45:30.395 --> 00:45:32.814
So... Where my pussy at?

930
00:45:32.814 --> 00:45:35.900
[professor] You have the micro story
for the Pareto principle

931

for how each individual action will go.

932
00:45:39.487 --> 00:45:40.738

A few of them will decide it's gone
high enough, they'll cash out,

1002
00:49:18.164 --> 00:49:21.250
the rest will follow,
whole thing will come crashing down.

1003
00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:24.420
I can't think of the last short squeeze
that actually worked.

1004
00:49:25.379 --> 00:49:26.714
Ackman and Herbalife.

1005
00:49:27.298 --> 00:49:29.300
Before that... Piggly Wiggly? [laughs]

1006
00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:30.635
Piggly Wiggly.

1007
00:49:30.635 --> 00:49:35.306
Yeah. 1923, a bear cartel was shorting
the Piggly Wiggly grocery store.

1008
00:49:35.306 --> 00:49:40.353
The founder, he takes out a loan
for what would be $150 million today.

1009
00:49:40.353 --> 00:49:42.813
He buys back almost all the stock,
like 99% of the stock.

1010
00:49:42.813 --> 00:49:45.149
The price of the stock goes up 50%.

1011
00:49:45.149 --> 00:49:47.401
- How much is GameStop up?
- Then, the exchange,

1012
00:49:47.401 --> 00:49:49.278
they halt trading on the stock

1013
00:49:49.278 --> 00:49:52.114
so the short sellers
can cover their positions.

1014
00:49:52.114 --> 00:49:53.783
Is that legal?

1015
00:49:53.783 --> 00:49:56.535
The founder had to declare bankruptcy. So...

1016
00:49:57.411 --> 00:49:58.913
it was all fine in the end.

1017
00:49:58.913 --> 00:50:01.457
And you knew all that or you looked it up?

1018
00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:04.710
Every fund manager knows that story.

1019
00:50:08.798 --> 00:50:10.174
You looked it up.

1020
00:50:12.009 --> 00:50:13.886

1028
00:50:44.292 --> 00:50:46.294
You should probably dial in.

1164
00:57:11.929 --> 00:57:14.515
Just take the money and do something nice.
Pay off your mortgage.

1165
00:57:14.515 --> 00:57:16.058
Get that one braces.

1166
00:57:16.642 --> 00:57:18.143
Look who's still holding.

1167
00:57:19.603 --> 00:57:21.605
If he's in, I'm in.

1168
00:57:21.605 --> 00:57:23.565
Yeah, he's still gonna need braces.

1169
00:57:23.565 --> 00:57:24.650
Your teeth are perfect.

1170
00:57:24.650 --> 00:57:27.903
So what? The stock's up $150.
How much higher is it gonna go?

1171
00:57:27.903 --> 00:57:30.197
We control the price now. Not Wall Street.

1172
00:57:30.197 --> 00:57:31.699
And no one on there is selling.

1173
00:57:31.699 --> 00:57:32.741
Shoes.

1174
00:57:32.741 --> 00:57:34.952
- Ugh. You're all so delusional.
- [Jenny] Maybe.

1175
00:57:34.952 --> 00:57:37.371
But look at what we managed to do
with these hedge funds.

1176
00:57:37.371 --> 00:57:38.997
If we keep driving up the price,

1177
00:57:38.997 --> 00:57:42.167
maybe we'll scare more of these guys
into closing out their shorts,

1178
00:57:42.167 --> 00:57:44.253
and then all of that bailout money...

1179
00:57:44.253 --> 00:57:45.671
- [Chris] Wait...
- becomes ours.

1180
00:57:45.671 --> 00:57:46.588
your screen name...

1181
00:57:47.381 --> 00:57:48.924
is Stonkmom?

1182
00:57:53.345 --> 00:57:54.346
- Hey!
- Help your mother.

1183
00:57:54.346 --> 00:57:56.849
- Why me and not Keith?
- Just shut up and do it, okay?

1184
00:57:56.849 --> 00:57:59.059
- Kev, take the potatoes.
- 'Cause you're rich now?

1185
00:57:59.059 --> 00:58:01.145
Mr. 23 million on paper but I won't sell.

1186
00:58:01.145 --> 00:58:03.397
- Kevin.
- Loser says what?

1187
00:58:04.398 --> 00:58:06.859
- What?
- Kevin, let Keith tell them.

1188
00:58:10.070 --> 00:58:10.946
Tell us what?

1189
00:58:12.573 --> 00:58:15.284
Oh, uh...
I was waiting to tell you in person.

1190
00:58:15.284 --> 00:58:18.412
But the, uh, stock we bet on,
GameStop, is up.

1191
00:58:18.412 --> 00:58:19.580
Ah, good.

1192
00:58:20.706 --> 00:58:23.167
- How much up?
- He's up 23 million, Pop.

1193
00:58:23.751 --> 00:58:24.752
[Steve] You're an asshole.

1194
00:58:24.752 --> 00:58:27.296
- Don't kid us.
- Uh, it's real.

1195
00:58:27.296 --> 00:58:29.965
Yeah, it's real.
And he's refusing to sell.

1196
00:58:31.842 --> 00:58:32.885
What is going on?

1197
00:58:33.927 --> 00:58:35.262
- You're pulling our leg.
- No.

1198
00:58:35.262 --> 00:58:37.181
Your son's a huge Internet celebrity now.

1199
00:58:37.181 --> 00:58:40.017
Millions of people including "Stonkmom"
thinks he's some like,

1200
00:58:40.017 --> 00:58:42.186
- I don't know, investment genius.
- No, he is a genius.

1201
00:58:42.186 --> 00:58:43.395
No, he's not.

1202
00:58:43.395 --> 00:58:45.147
You're up 23 million?

1203
00:58:46.148 --> 00:58:47.566
And you're not selling.

1204
00:58:49.193 --> 00:58:50.527
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

1205
00:58:50.527 --> 00:58:52.029
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1206
00:58:52.029 --> 00:58:54.364
Do you even know
how much $23 million is?

1207
00:58:54.364 --> 00:58:56.658
And you're just gonna let it ride?
What's the matter with you?

1208
00:58:56.658 --> 00:58:58.869
- I know what I'm doing, Dad.
- [Elaine] But why aren't you selling?

1209
00:58:58.869 --> 00:59:00.788
What, wait! Is this illegal?
Are you in trouble?

1210
00:59:00.788 --> 00:59:01.955
No. No, he's not in trouble.

1211
00:59:01.955 --> 00:59:03.040
- It's totally legal.
- Yeah.

1212
00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:04.833
He's posting his balance sheet
on the Internet.

1213
00:59:04.833 --> 00:59:06.001
- What?
- [Keith] Hedge fund managers,

1214
00:59:06.001 --> 00:59:08.462
they go on CNBC all the time
to pump up the stock.

1215
00:59:08.462 --> 00:59:10.923
All I do is post my balance sheet
on Wall Street Bets

1216
00:59:10.923 --> 00:59:14.176
- after market close.
- You post your balance sheet?

1217
00:59:14.176 --> 00:59:15.344
Yeah, the same idiot

1218
00:59:15.344 --> 00:59:18.138
who left a fresh pair of Nikes out on
the bleachers for just anyone to take.

1219
00:59:18.138 --> 00:59:19.306
So you admit they were stolen!

1220
00:59:19.306 --> 00:59:20.933
- We gotta talk about this.
- You're a fuckin' moron.

1221
00:59:20.933 --> 00:59:22.392
- Least I won.
- What's the point of winning

1222
00:59:22.392 --> 00:59:23.727
if you let some dipshit steal the prize?

1223
00:59:23.727 --> 00:59:25.270
You would've broke a four
if you had the Zooms.

1224
00:59:25.270 --> 00:59:26.772
A four minute mile
isn't everything, Kevin.

1225
00:59:26.772 --> 00:59:28.649
Maybe we should get in touch
with Briggsy.

1226
00:59:28.649 --> 00:59:30.651
- You know, he works in finance.
- Yes.

1227
00:59:30.651 --> 00:59:32.861
You think Briggsy knows
more about this than Keith does?

1228
00:59:32.861 --> 00:59:34.905
Well, can you talk about why
you're putting your stocks

1229
00:59:34.905 --> 00:59:37.157
- in the Wall Street Journal?
- Wall Street Bets.

1230
00:59:37.157 --> 00:59:38.742
What if someone tries to rob you?
Kidnap the baby?

1231
00:59:38.742 --> 00:59:39.993
No one's gonna kidnap the baby.

1232
00:59:39.993 --> 00:59:41.870
- Nobody wants that baby, Mom.
- [Steve] I'm just saying,

1233
00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:43.163
that if we're gonna talk to somebody,

1234
00:59:43.163 --> 00:59:44.873
- you need to talk to Briggsy.
- [Elaine] Yes, honey.

1235
00:59:44.873 --> 00:59:46.458
- This is the point...
- Enough!

1236
00:59:47.543 --> 00:59:49.127
You guys, Keith has literally

1237
00:59:49.127 --> 00:59:51.421
poured his heart and his soul
into this for the past year.

1238
00:59:51.421 --> 00:59:52.798
He knows what he's doing.

1239
00:59:58.554 --> 01:00:01.056
I know it's been a tough time, Elaine.

1240
01:00:08.981 --> 01:00:10.065
You should still sell.

1241
01:00:12.484 --> 01:00:13.652
Think you should sell.

1242
01:00:15.779 --> 01:00:17.489
[professor speaking indistinctly]

1243
01:00:17.489 --> 01:00:19.783
And just fuck the principle
of the whole thing?

1244
01:00:19.783 --> 01:00:21.743
I don't like it any more than you do.

1245
01:00:21.743 --> 01:00:23.787
[tense, pensive music playing]

1246
01:00:37.092 --> 01:00:38.552
You really don't think
that he's fucking selling?

1247
01:00:38.552 --> 01:00:39.469
[Harmony] No!

1248
01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:40.804

Masks.

1250
01:00:46.727 --> 01:00:50.105
Kids are with their father for a few days.
So, I'm going to Florida.

1251
01:00:50.105 --> 01:00:52.858
You finally fucking sold.
Halle­fuckin-lujah.

1252
01:00:52.858 --> 01:00:54.985
No, I'm putting it on my Visa.

1253
01:00:54.985 --> 01:00:56.069
You shitting me?

1254
01:00:56.069 --> 01:00:58.238
You're worth hundreds of thousands
of dollars in stock,

1255
01:00:58.238 --> 01:00:59.865
and you're amassing credit card debt.

1256
01:00:59.865 --> 01:01:01.867
You really are out of your mind.

1257
01:01:01.867 --> 01:01:05.871
No, babe, I'm all in. Diamond hand.

1258
01:01:05.871 --> 01:01:07.956
Did you know that Gabe Plotkin
gave an interview?

1259
01:01:07.956 --> 01:01:10.500
He's been getting death threats,
anti-Semitic messages

1260
01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.836
- from these WSB guys.
- It was ten comments.

1261
01:01:12.836 --> 01:01:15.756
There's always bad apples.
And the moderators deleted it right away.

1262
01:01:15.756 --> 01:01:17.841
[Chris] You're just gonna ride this thing
till zero?

1263
01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:20.052
No. I'm buying call options.

1264
01:01:20.052 --> 01:01:23.597
- That could go to 600 by tomorrow.
- Your kid is never getting braces.

1265

[Marcos] <i>There's 8 million people in there
and they're all holding.</i>

<i>It's only going to go up.</i>

1267
01:01:35.275 --> 01:01:36.818
[in Spanish] It's a joke, Marcos.

1268
01:01:36.818 --> 01:01:38.862
But you're treating it
like it's real life.

1269
01:01:39.738 --> 01:01:40.572
Pops.

1270
01:01:42.783 --> 01:01:43.617
Look.

1271
01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:47.079
- This is real. Hold it. Look.
- [in English] Hey.

1272
01:01:47.079 --> 01:01:48.038
Aw, man.

1273
01:01:49.706 --> 01:01:51.416
8 million people is real.

1274
01:01:51.416 --> 01:01:53.085
[in Spanish] H-O-D-L.

1275
01:01:53.794 --> 01:01:57.255
8 million don't even know
how to spell "hold."

1276
01:01:57.255 --> 01:01:58.173
It's a joke.

1277
01:01:58.173 --> 01:02:00.926
- [woman speaks in Spanish] A corny joke.
- [in English] It's not funny.

1278
01:02:04.721 --> 01:02:05.555
Mom,

1279
01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:07.933
look.

1280
01:02:07.933 --> 01:02:10.560
I got $175,000 in stock right now.

1281
01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:11.728
[in Spanish] What?

1282
01:02:11.728 --> 01:02:12.688
Like serious money,

1283
01:02:12.688 --> 01:02:15.774
like I could get you a house
and get you up out of here, kind of money.

1284
01:02:15.774 --> 01:02:16.942
Baby.

1285
01:02:16.942 --> 01:02:19.361
Where did you get the money to buy this?

1286
01:02:19.361 --> 01:02:20.445
[father] Uh-huh.

1287
01:02:20.445 --> 01:02:23.323
I bought call options, for cheap.

1288
01:02:23.323 --> 01:02:26.410
- And they hit.
- [in English] So now you're gonna sell?

1289
01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:27.828
Nah. No, I buy more.

1290
01:02:28.662 --> 01:02:30.497
[in Spanish] At this price!?

1291
01:02:30.497 --> 01:02:32.541
When they hit,
I'm gonna buy you a mansion.

1292
01:02:32.541 --> 01:02:33.625
It's gonna be crazy.

1293
01:02:33.625 --> 01:02:36.420
My son, I don't need a mansion.

Don't get addicted to this, my son.

01:02:44.136 --> 01:02:45.846

So did we. But the committee's
specifically requested you, sir.

they can have Mecane.

- I never did anything illegal.

And I always had disclaimers...

1529

Why would you have disclaimers
if you weren't worried?

You have to testify before Congress.

You need to figure this out.

- To the track.

- It is when you sit up here.

Well, there is a last time for everything.

1548

Oh, you'll be back.

1549
01:15:07.503 --> 01:15:11.758
I had half a million in stocks last week,
but Wall Street cheated.

You know you can't just eat other people's
food. They do reviews, right?

Look, they were on sale, all right,

- Holy shit, you fucking softy.

needed some moral support.

Ah, fuck off. I can't.

C'mon, man.
Will you at least try 'em on? Please?

1570

Try 'em. C'mon,
you're the richest man in Brockton,

- you dress like an asshole.
- I lost 15 million yesterday.

1572

And another 15 the day before that.

1573
01:16:01.641 --> 01:16:04.018
You're still the richest man in Brockton,
like, by far.

1574

Bro, you got rich dudes
pissing in their pants right now.

1575

I mean, c'mon, man, how many people
from Brockton High can say that?

This has gone crazy,

1577
01:16:12.485 --> 01:16:15.321
I got reporters hounding me
outside my house.

1578
01:16:15.321 --> 01:16:17.448
Yeah, man, me too.
They're coming after you.

1579

You didn't talk to them, did you?

1580
01:16:20.743 --> 01:16:24.080
What do I look like? I said no.
I said give me 50 grand maybe.

Tell me you're kidding.

1582

Well, if you give me 20, then maybe
we wouldn't have to deal with this shit.

Kevin, I've just been subpoenaed
by Congress, man.

I do not have time for your bullshit.

- Seriously, asshole.

We never used to fight this much.

Whole fuckin' world kept my ego in check.

What the fuck are you gonna tell
Congress, Keith? Huh?

1598
01:17:14.255 --> 01:17:16.299
Beg them not to send me to prison?

Hey...

1600
01:17:20.136 --> 01:17:24.265
Hey, do you remember back at Stonehill
when they dared me to run that mile naked?

1601

Yeah, there was a crazy storm that night.

1602

- Fuck you, man.

That was dope, man.
I'm a legend over there.

- Okay.
- They do, man.

1606

You don't think people remember
your 4-minute 3-second mile?

Oh... what is this, a pep talk?

Motherfucker, stop hiding.

Seriously. Okay, stop being all meek
and shit and running away.

1620

Yup, he, uh, told me to run naked.

1621

- You ran naked?
- No.

1622

I gotta take this thing head on.

01:20:08.345 --> 01:20:09.805
[woman] Maybe leave that part out.

1656
01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:12.224
The part about my dad?

1657
01:20:12.224 --> 01:20:13.350
The executive part.

1658
01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:14.935
Okay... okay.

1659
01:20:18.272 --> 01:20:22.735
I went to a public high school.
I studied hard and got into Northwestern.

1660
01:20:22.735 --> 01:20:24.820
- Just say "a good college."
- Upon...

1661
01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:26.405
I can't say I went to Northwestern?

1662
01:20:26.405 --> 01:20:28.282
- Too elite.
- Northwestern's too...

1663
01:20:28.949 --> 01:20:29.784
All right.

1664
01:20:33.788 --> 01:20:38.375
Upon graduation, I did not have a job.
Today, I'm married with four children.

1665
01:20:38.375 --> 01:20:40.628
Gabe, where do you plan on
doing your testimony?

1666
01:20:43.005 --> 01:20:45.758
- Here.
- In front of your wine collection?

1667
01:20:47.802 --> 01:20:50.971
I mean, this is... I don't have that big
of a wine collection honestly.

1668
01:20:50.971 --> 01:20:52.014
Yeah, it's huge.

1669
01:20:52.014 --> 01:20:53.933
[Keith]
Digital risks seem to be overblown.

1670
01:20:53.933 --> 01:20:56.435
Two, the negative sentiment is overdone.

1671
01:20:56.435 --> 01:21:00.231
- Three, the value...
- Maybe... here would be nice.

1672
01:21:03.526 --> 01:21:05.528
- Too many windows.
- Too many windows... Oh.

1673
01:21:05.528 --> 01:21:06.695
It's very bright.

1674
01:21:06.695 --> 01:21:09.865
- Yeah, ocean front's not a great idea.
- It's blue.

1675
01:21:09.865 --> 01:21:11.617
Yeah. Okay, I hadn't thought of that.

1676
01:21:11.617 --> 01:21:14.537
That, uh, yeah, downstairs there's more...
there's probably darker rooms.

1677
01:21:14.537 --> 01:21:16.705
[woman on TV] <i>What a bandit.
Most of you know this guy,</i>

1678
01:21:16.705 --> 01:21:18.332
<i>who is the Roaring Kitty character,</i>

1679
01:21:18.332 --> 01:21:19.792
- <i>who was really pushing it.</i>
- Holy shit.

1680
01:21:19.792 --> 01:21:21.836
- <i>You know, voicing the information.</i>
- Yo, Riri, our boy's on the news.

1681
01:21:21.836 --> 01:21:23.754
<i>And what's the potentially systemic risk?</i>

1682
01:21:23.754 --> 01:21:26.090
[man]
<i>Those relationships in D.C. are strong.</i>

1683
01:21:26.090 --> 01:21:30.219
<i>The guys who run those hedge funds are
the guys who fund presidential campaigns.</i>

1684
01:21:30.219 --> 01:21:32.179
<i>- You know Roaring Kitties don't have
- That's a good point.</i>

1685
01:21:32.179 --> 01:21:33.597
<i>- that kind of influence,
- Gill is now being sued</i>

1686
01:21:33.597 --> 01:21:34.682
<i>- but the hedge fund managers do.
- for securities fraud</i>

1687
01:21:34.682 --> 01:21:37.017
<i>over his alleged role
in the GameStop rally.</i>

1688
01:21:37.017 --> 01:21:39.895
<i>Is Mr. Gill likely to appear,
and if he appears,</i>

1689
01:21:39.895 --> 01:21:44.066
<i>is he likely to talk
if he faces the potential of prosecution?</i>

1690
01:21:44.066 --> 01:21:49.071
Fundamentals are based on three things:
One, digital risks are overblown.

1691
01:21:49.071 --> 01:21:50.990
Two, the negative sentiment is overdone.

1692
01:21:50.990 --> 01:21:52.199
And three...

1693
01:21:55.911 --> 01:21:56.745
Fuck.

1694
01:21:56.745 --> 01:21:58.956
- Ah, c'mon, shut up.
- [Keith] I know all this.

1695
01:21:58.956 --> 01:22:00.374
[Kevin laughing]

1696
01:22:00.374 --> 01:22:02.877
You guys, you guys, stop.
Stop, let's keep going.

1697
01:22:02.877 --> 01:22:04.003
All right, let's go again.

1698
01:22:04.003 --> 01:22:06.338
You're right, this is serious.
You can go to jail forever.

1699
01:22:06.338 --> 01:22:07.965
- A long time. Long, long time.
- All right. You ready?

1700
01:22:07.965 --> 01:22:09.925
You ready here we go. Back in the game.

1701
01:22:09.925 --> 01:22:13.095
- Mr. Gill. May I call you Mr. Gill, sir?
- It's my name.

1702
01:22:13.095 --> 01:22:15.598
[Kevin] Why the fuck wouldn't you be able
to call him Mr. Gill?

1703
01:22:15.598 --> 01:22:17.558
What were your intentions
with the YouTube videos

1704
01:22:17.558 --> 01:22:19.185
and your social media posts on GameStop?

1705
01:22:19.185 --> 01:22:20.769
- Yes.
- [Keith] Thank you, congresswoman.

1706
01:22:20.769 --> 01:22:22.271
[Caroline] You're welcome.

1707
01:22:22.271 --> 01:22:24.398
I developed a theory
that the company was undervalued

1708
01:22:24.398 --> 01:22:26.192
despite the significant short interest.

1709
01:22:26.192 --> 01:22:28.194
Oh, so you were aware
of the short interest.

1710
01:22:28.194 --> 01:22:30.779
It is public knowledge.
You can see it in the SEC filings.

1711
01:22:30.779 --> 01:22:33.115
[Briggsy] And your goal
was to break these shorts, yes?

1712
01:22:33.115 --> 01:22:36.744
To rally an online mob to artificially
push the price of GameStop soaring,

1713
01:22:36.744 --> 01:22:39.872
ah, "to the moon" as they say,
isn't that correct, Mr. Gill?

1714
01:22:39.872 --> 01:22:41.832
Objection, objection,
you're leading the witness.

1715
01:22:41.832 --> 01:22:42.917
- Kev...
- [Briggsy] Witness.

1716
01:22:42.917 --> 01:22:44.376
I yield my time to the chair.

1717
01:22:44.376 --> 01:22:46.837
You were hoping for the short squeeze,
weren't you, Mr. Gill?

1718
01:22:46.837 --> 01:22:48.005
You short squeezing bastard.

1719
01:22:48.005 --> 01:22:50.090
The short squeeze
was a marginal point of the thesis.

1720
01:22:50.090 --> 01:22:52.259
[Briggsy] Then why did you talk about it
in your videos all the time?

1721
01:22:52.259 --> 01:22:54.094
You did talk about it in your videos.
You talked about it a lot.

1722
01:22:54.094 --> 01:22:55.638
- You remember about the squeeze.
- Exactly.

1723
01:22:55.638 --> 01:22:56.847
You were like
"It's just a little squeeze."

1724
01:22:56.847 --> 01:22:57.848
[Briggsy] Exactly.

1725
01:22:57.848 --> 01:23:00.392
Are you really asking us to believe
that you weren't a leader

1726
01:23:00.392 --> 01:23:02.603
- to all these retail traders?
- You're fucked, buddy.

1727
01:23:02.603 --> 01:23:04.772
- My point of view...
- Asking. Yes or no?

1728
01:23:04.772 --> 01:23:06.273
- [Kevin] Yes or no?
- [Briggsy] Yes. So yes.

1729
01:23:06.273 --> 01:23:07.483
- Yes or no?
- You are admitting it. Yes.

1730
01:23:07.483 --> 01:23:08.901
Remember you with a cheap bottle
of champagne.

1731
01:23:08.901 --> 01:23:10.110
At any moment... Kevin!

1732
01:23:10.110 --> 01:23:11.153
- Kevin!
- Dunking tendies like a fucking--

1733
01:23:11.153 --> 01:23:12.071
What?

1734
01:23:13.364 --> 01:23:15.741
I'm running with my dick out.

1735
01:23:16.825 --> 01:23:18.202
Okay, why don't you just say that?

1736
01:23:18.202 --> 01:23:19.578
Okay, I'll stop.

1737
01:23:20.371 --> 01:23:25.251
All right. Mr. Gill, what exactly
about the fundamentals

1738
01:23:25.251 --> 01:23:28.545
- led you to build this bull case?
- [Briggsy] What the fuck's with the voice?

1739
01:23:28.545 --> 01:23:30.881
I don't know, I was trying to do AOC,
but it was flat.

1740
01:23:30.881 --> 01:23:32.174
[Briggsy]
I don't even think she's on the panel.

1741
01:23:32.174 --> 01:23:33.384
[Kevin] You shut the fuck up, Briggsy.

1742
01:23:33.384 --> 01:23:34.760
- I'll slap the shit out of you.
- [Briggsy] Is she on that panel?

1743
01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:35.678
- [Kevin] I swear to God.
- [Briggsy] You're gonna slap me?

1744
01:23:35.678 --> 01:23:37.054
- [Kevin] Yeah, let's go.
- [Briggsy] You ready to go?

1745
01:23:37.054 --> 01:23:39.723
<i>- Let's go.</i>
- [Kevin] <i>I've been waiting for this, dog.</i>

1746
01:23:45.104 --> 01:23:48.107
[tense, pensive music playing]

1747
01:23:51.443 --> 01:23:52.528
[sighs]

1748
01:23:57.157 --> 01:23:57.992
Come here.

1749
01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:08.711
You're gonna be great.

1750
01:24:09.962 --> 01:24:12.673
If it goes bad, it's gonna be real bad.

1751
01:24:12.673 --> 01:24:14.466
Well, don't let it go bad.

1752
01:24:14.466 --> 01:24:18.721
[Waters] <i>This hearing will be first
in a series of hearings by the committee</i>

1753
01:24:18.721 --> 01:24:23.809
<i>to examine the recent market volatility
involving GameStop.</i>

1754
01:24:23.809 --> 01:24:28.397
<i>I want to know how each
of the witnesses here today</i>

1755
01:24:28.397 --> 01:24:30.566
- <i>contributed to the historic...</i>
- Gabe, can you sit up?

1756
01:24:30.566 --> 01:24:33.736
<i>trading events in January.</i>

1757
01:24:34.278 --> 01:24:36.530
<i>This recent market volatility</i>

1758
01:24:36.530 --> 01:24:41.118
<i>has put a national spotlight
on institutional practices</i>

1759
01:24:41.118 --> 01:24:42.786
<i>by Wall Street firms.</i>

1760
01:24:42.786 --> 01:24:46.457
<i>And they have demonstrated
the enormous potential power</i>

1761
01:24:46.457 --> 01:24:49.168
<i>of social media in our markets.</i>

1762
01:24:49.752 --> 01:24:53.297
<i>We will hear firsthand from the witnesses
regarding these events.</i>

1763
01:24:53.922 --> 01:24:58.093
<i>The hearing will be an opportunity
for this committee to get the facts</i>

1764
01:24:58.093 --> 01:25:01.347
<i>about the role
each of the witnesses represent,</i>

1765
01:25:01.347 --> 01:25:04.975
<i>played in the events
we are examining today.</i>

1766
01:25:04.975 --> 01:25:07.436
[Vargas] <i>Well, now, Mr. Griffin,
if I could ask you this first question.</i>

1767
01:25:07.436 --> 01:25:08.354
Of course.

1768
01:25:08.354 --> 01:25:10.522
<i>How many people
are in the room with you?</i>

1769
01:25:11.398 --> 01:25:12.441
[Ken] That's your question?

1770
01:25:12.441 --> 01:25:14.526
<i>If you can just count how many
people are in the room with you.</i>

1771
01:25:19.156 --> 01:25:22.659
<i>There are five people,
including myself, in this room.</i>

1772
01:25:22.659 --> 01:25:24.328
- [Vargas] <i>Anyone in your organization...</i>
- Such a prick.

1773
01:25:24.328 --> 01:25:26.538
<i>since January 1st, contact Robinhood?</i>

1774
01:25:26.538 --> 01:25:31.377
We of course talk to Robinhood routinely
in the ordinary course of business.

1775
01:25:31.377 --> 01:25:33.712
We manage a substantial portion
of their order flow.

1776
01:25:33.712 --> 01:25:36.090
<i>But did you talk to them about restricting</i>

1777
01:25:36.090 --> 01:25:40.302
<i>or doing anything to prevent people
from buying GameStop?</i>

1778
01:25:40.302 --> 01:25:43.097
I want to be perfectly clear.

1779
01:25:43.097 --> 01:25:46.809
<i>We had no role in Robinhood's decision</i>

1780
01:25:46.809 --> 01:25:49.061
- <i>to limit trading in GameStop.</i>
- Fuck you, Ken Griffin.

1781
01:25:49.061 --> 01:25:52.940
[Vargas] <i>So, if we depose everyone
in your organization, we would find that?</i>

1782
01:25:53.607 --> 01:25:54.525
That is correct.

1783
01:25:54.525 --> 01:25:57.152
Looks like a Disney Channel villain.

1784
01:25:57.152 --> 01:26:01.740
<i>Mr. Plotkin, do you believe
that there is manipulation, distrust,</i>

1785
01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:04.660
<i>and overall inequality
within American finance?</i>

1786
01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:06.829
My focus is on my company, Melvin...

1787
01:26:06.829 --> 01:26:08.497
[inaudible]

1788
01:26:08.497 --> 01:26:09.665
[Kevin] Hello?

1789
01:26:09.665 --> 01:26:11.375
You're on mute, dick!

1790
01:26:11.375 --> 01:26:13.001
<i>Ah, I'm sorry, you're on mute.</i>

1791
01:26:13.502 --> 01:26:14.628
[all laughing]

1792
01:26:17.214 --> 01:26:18.882
[woman] He just keeps going.

1793
01:26:18.882 --> 01:26:20.717
...my area of expertise.

1794
01:26:20.717 --> 01:26:24.471
<i>You're still on mute. I haven't been able
to hear a word you said, unfortunately.</i>

1795
01:26:24.471 --> 01:26:26.849
[Ocasio-Cortez] <i>Mr. Tenev,
would you be willing to commit today</i>

1796
01:26:26.849 --> 01:26:29.017
<i>- to voluntarily pass on the proceeds...</i>
- Oh. Marry me.

1797
01:26:29.017 --> 01:26:31.812
<i>of the payment for order flow
to Robinhood customers?</i>

1798
01:26:31.812 --> 01:26:34.356
Congresswoman, I appreciate that question.

1799
01:26:34.356 --> 01:26:38.569
When the statement you refer to was made,
it was before Robinhood forced

1800
01:26:38.569 --> 01:26:40.571
the entire industry to drop

1801
01:26:40.571 --> 01:26:42.281
- commissions and replicate our...
<i>- I should take that as a no.</i>

1802
01:26:42.281 --> 01:26:45.117
<i>You're not willing to pass on
the proceeds of payment for order flow</i>

1803
01:26:45.117 --> 01:26:46.076
<i>to your customers?</i>

1804
01:26:46.076 --> 01:26:48.787
- When the other brokers drop...
- <i>I'm just talking about today.</i>

1805
01:26:48.787 --> 01:26:49.997
- Asshole.
- <i>I don't want to be rude.</i>

1806
01:26:49.997 --> 01:26:51.373
<i>I just have limited time,</i>

1807
01:26:51.373 --> 01:26:55.377
<i>but if removing the revenues that you make
from a payment for order flow</i>

1808
01:26:55.377 --> 01:26:58.881
<i>would cause the removal
of free commissions,</i>

1809
01:26:58.881 --> 01:27:00.674
<i>doesn't that mean that
trading on Robinhood</i>

1810
01:27:00.674 --> 01:27:02.634
<i>isn't actually free to begin with?</i>

1811
01:27:02.634 --> 01:27:04.011
[woman] Good question.

1812
01:27:10.642 --> 01:27:12.895
[Waters] <i>Thank you very much, Mr. Gill.</i>

1815
01:27:29.453 --> 01:27:31.914
Thank you, members of the committee.

1816
01:27:34.458 --> 01:27:37.753
I am happy to discuss my purchase
of GameStop shares

1817
01:27:38.337 --> 01:27:41.715
and my discussions of their fair value
on social media.

1818
01:27:42.549 --> 01:27:44.176
But before I do that,

1819
01:27:44.176 --> 01:27:46.094
a few things I am not:

1820
01:27:47.888 --> 01:27:49.097
I am not a cat.

1821
01:27:50.641 --> 01:27:52.893
- What did he say?
- [Kevin] He just said cat, Ma.

1822
01:27:52.893 --> 01:27:54.186
It's like a kitty thing.

1823
01:27:54.186 --> 01:27:56.605
<i>Nor am I a hedge fund.
I do not have clients,</i>

1824
01:27:56.605 --> 01:28:01.944
<i>and I do not provide personalized
investment advice for fees or commissions.</i>

1825
01:28:01.944 --> 01:28:04.029
I grew up in Brockton, Mass.

1826
01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:06.657
My family was not wealthy.

1827
01:28:06.657 --> 01:28:09.993
<i>My father was a truck driver
and my mom a registered nurse.</i>

1828
01:28:09.993 --> 01:28:12.204
- [Kevin] That's you, Ma!
- I was one of three kids

1829
01:28:12.204 --> 01:28:15.290
and the first in my family
to earn a four-year college degree

1830
01:28:15.290 --> 01:28:19.461
when I graduated from Stonehill College
in 2009.

1831
01:28:19.461 --> 01:28:21.588
<i>That was not a good time
to be looking for a job.</i>

1832
01:28:21.588 --> 01:28:24.091
<i>From 2010-2017,</i>

1833
01:28:24.091 --> 01:28:27.553
<i>there were significant periods
when I was unemployed.</i>

1834
01:28:27.553 --> 01:28:29.930
<i>I took an interest in the stock market,</i>

1835
01:28:29.930 --> 01:28:32.224
and even though I had very little money,

1836
01:28:32.224 --> 01:28:36.436
I used those times to educate myself
and learn more about investing.

1837
01:28:36.436 --> 01:28:40.399
<i>Mr. Gill, I find it hard to believe
that you predicted everything</i>

1838
01:28:40.399 --> 01:28:44.069
<i>that happened to GameStop
with no inside information.</i>

1839
01:28:44.069 --> 01:28:45.821
Uh, I didn't predict it.

1840
01:28:45.821 --> 01:28:49.199
I honestly couldn't explain everything
that happened in January.

1841
01:28:49.199 --> 01:28:53.036
<i>I've seen your videos. You honestly
couldn't recount to the committee</i>

1842
01:28:53.036 --> 01:28:57.624
<i>what caused every single up and down
of the stock in January?</i>

1843
01:28:58.208 --> 01:28:59.334
<i>I think you could.</i>

1844
01:29:00.669 --> 01:29:04.047
I did follow the stock, uh, very closely,

1845
01:29:04.047 --> 01:29:07.676
but threshold lists, order flows,
halting purchases, according to the press,

1846
01:29:07.676 --> 01:29:09.636
these all had a material impact
on the stock.

1847
01:29:09.636 --> 01:29:12.306
Here's the thing: I have
a bit of experience with this stuff,

1848
01:29:12.306 --> 01:29:14.308
and even I barely understand
these matters.

1849
01:29:14.308 --> 01:29:18.186
It's alarming how little we all know
about the inner workings of the market.

1850
01:29:18.186 --> 01:29:20.897
Which is why I'm glad this committee
is examining what happened,

1851
01:29:20.897 --> 01:29:23.692
particularly with the exorbitant
short interest

1852
01:29:23.692 --> 01:29:26.653
as well as any potentially
manipulative shorting practices

1853
01:29:26.653 --> 01:29:30.824
and brokers' reported failures to
timely deliver shares and settle trades.

1854

[mouths]

1855
01:29:34.119 --> 01:29:36.330
A lot of people feel the system is broken.

1856
01:29:36.330 --> 01:29:40.417
<i>The whole idea of the stock market is to
be, like, kind of a fair playing field,</i>

1857
01:29:40.417 --> 01:29:44.338
<i>where if you're smart, maybe with a little
luck, you could make your fortune.</i>

1858
01:29:45.130 --> 01:29:47.466
<i>But, if it ever was that,
it's certainly not any more.</i>

1859
01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:51.887
The big firms have such a big advantage,
in terms of technology and information

1860
01:29:51.887 --> 01:29:55.223
and just sheer wealth, there's no hope
for the little guy anymore.
