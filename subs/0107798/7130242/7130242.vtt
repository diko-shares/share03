00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.500
The Pelican Brief (1993)

3
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.155
<i>Any signs got my name on them?</i>

4
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.513
Quite a few.

5
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.433
What do they say?

6
00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.188
The usual.

7
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.518
"Death to Rosenberg."

8
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.512
"Retire Rosenberg."

9
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.032
"Cut off the oxygen."

10
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.391
That's my favorite.

11
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.836
Of course, you, Mr. Grantham...

12
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.833
...did pretty good by me
your last time out.

13
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.151
"Rosenberg equals the government
over business...

14
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.439
...the individual over government,
the environment over everything...

15
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.399
...and the Indians, oh,
give them whatever they want."

16
00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.276
With all due respect,
that wasn't my line, that was a quote.

17
00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.195
From one of your unnamed
Senior White House officials.

18
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.079
Senior White House bastard,
you should have said.

19
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.673
Got in there by...

20
00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.878
...stirring up these people,
one against the other.

21
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.235
Never fails to amaze me...

22
00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.029
...what a man will do
to get an oval office.

23
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.230
Looking for Mr. Sneller.

24
00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.879
Yes, Mr. Edwin F. Sneller.

25
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.395
<i>Everything is in place.</i>

26
00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.519
All the money must be there
when I arrive in Zürich.

27
00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.593
<i>It will be there</i>
<i>if the job is finished.</i>

28
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.238
It will be finished.

29
00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.394
<i>- May I help you?</i>
- I'd like to order room service.

30
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.438
<i>- What would you like?</i>
- Coffee...

31
00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.953
...scrambled eggs, whole-wheat toast
and orange juice, please.

32
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.918
<i>It'll be about 15 minutes.</i>

33
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.909
<i>When we substitute threat</i>
<i>for an argument...</i>

34
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.072
...violence for principle,
we allow our passion...

35
00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.151
...to overcome our capacity for reason.

36
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.188
Passion and self-interest
are threats to liberty...

37
00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.910
...which brings us
to Bowers against Hardwick.

38
00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.358
A police officer entered Mr. Hardwick's
apartment to serve him a warrant...

39
00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.712
...for an unpaid violation
for drinking in public.

40
00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.110
They caught him with an open beer.

41
00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.749
When he entered
Mr. Hardwick's bedroom...

42
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.230
...he found him in bed with a man.

43
00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.512
The officer arrested Hardwick...

44
00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.593
...for violating Georgia's statute
which outlaws sodomy.

45
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.270
Even though Georgia dropped the case...

46
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.035
...Hardwick challenged
the constitutionality of the statute.

47
00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.599
Now, what was his claim?

48
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.758
- That it violates the right of privacy.
- Why?

49
00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.918
He's got the right to do
as he pleases in his home.

50
00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:29.796
But what if he decided to sell drugs
at his home or engage in child abuse?

51
00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.589
Those actions don't fit
within the right of privacy.

52
00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.797
The court, beginning with Griswold...

53
00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:38.918
...has limited the right of privacy
to actions which are intimate...

54
00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:43.517
...which are deeply personal,
which allow us to control our lives...

55
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.193
...to define who we are.

56
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.199
But is that a constitutional claim?
There's no...

57
00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:51.159
...right to define oneself
written into the Constitution.

58
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.118
It's not even in the Bill of Rights.

59
00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.079
If the State of Georgia can regulate
Hardwick's sexuality...

60
00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.357
...engaged in private with consenting
adults, Hardwick cannot be free.

61
00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.955
The Constitution ensures
limited government.

62
00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.670
If there's no right of privacy
and Georgia can enforce the statute...

63
00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.912
...we sacrifice the liberty the framers
thought they'd guaranteed us.

64
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.477
The Supreme Court disagreed with you.

65
00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.393
They found that the statute
did not violate the right of privacy.

66
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:15.709
Why?

67
00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:16.915
They're wrong.

68
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:44.153
<i>So all three of you girls</i>
<i>find him irresistible. Why?</i>

69
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.913
<i>Sexual attraction.</i>

70
00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.435
<i>You mean he's just got it?</i>

71
00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.039
<i>Does he ever!</i>

72
00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.713
<i>What you're saying...</i>

73
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.396
<i>... is that if you could clone</i>
<i>three of him, you'd all be happy.</i>

74
00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.393
<i>Okay, tell us, what is your secret?</i>

75
00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.710
<i>I'm not sure I can say on TV.</i>

76
00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.838
<i>But what I can say is</i>
<i>it's a big secret.</i>

77
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.071
<i>A very big secret.</i>

78
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.995
<i>My goodness gracious!</i>
<i>I can't believe my ears!</i>

79
00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.798
<i>Hope my mom 's not watching.</i>

80
00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.393
<i>She hopes so too!</i>

81
00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.073
<i>Ma, I was just kidding.</i>

82
00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.914
<i>Ladies, have you changed your opinion</i>
<i>about our stud?</i>

83
00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.912
<i>You still like him?</i>

84
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.435
<i>I like big guys!</i>

85
00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.955
<i>I think your fan club has increased.</i>

86
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.599
<i>Everything has increased!</i>

87
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.150
They found Rosenberg around 1 A.M.

88
00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.391
His nurse was also murdered.

89
00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:13.393
Jensen was found two hours later
in some queer club.

90
00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:18.031
Voyles called me, wildly upset.
It's hardly good for FBI's reputation.

91
00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.032
He and Giminski are on the way.

92
00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.036
CIA should be involved,
at least for now.

93
00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:28.035
You must wait two hours to address
the nation if we want an audience.

94
00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.917
A coat and tie may seem a bit rehearsed.
How about a cardigan?

95
00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.517
You want me to talk to the nation
in a time of crisis wearing a sweater?

96
00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:37.909
Mr. President...

97
00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.908
...I've already told Justice
to put together a list of nominees.

98
00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.549
Restructuring the court
will be your legacy.

99
00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.634
Mr. President.

100
00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.673
Mr. Voyles, does the FBI
have any suspects?

101
00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.069
It's too soon.

102
00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.754
We'll have ballistics
and autopsies later.

103
00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.232
I would like to have a report on your
security and where it broke down.

104
00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.831
You're assuming it broke down.

105
00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:07.995
We have two dead judges, both of whom
were being protected by the FBI.

106
00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.276
Bob, I'd like a straight answer.

107
00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.870
Are these killings in any way
linked to the CIA...

108
00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:18.033
...or to any other agency
of the United States government?

109
00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:19.952
I'm shocked you'd think that.

110
00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.156
Bob, just look into it, okay?

111
00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.954
I suggest we meet back here at five.

112
00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.397
Five, gentlemen.
Thank you.

113
00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.951
It's rally-around-the-leader time.

114
00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.915
Your approval ratings will go
through the roof.

115
00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.557
<i>That's the weather in New Orleans.</i>
<i>This is Tim Bellew.</i>

116
00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.360
<i>We interrupt our program now</i>
<i>for a special bulletin.</i>

117
00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:50.592
<i>In a special address,</i>
<i>live from the White House...</i>

118
00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.149
<i>... the President of the United States.</i>

119
00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.152
<i>My fellow Americans...</i>

120
00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.751
<i>... our country has suffered</i>
<i>a grievous loss.</i>

121
00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.589
<i>Last night...</i>

122
00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:06.713
<i>... Supreme Court Justices</i>
<i>Rosenberg and Jensen...</i>

123
00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.518
<i>... were assassinated.</i>

124
00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:14.870
<i>These assassinations may be an</i>
<i>attempt to strike at the very fabric...</i>

125
00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.633
<i>... of our government.</i>

126
00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.271
<i>But I can assure each...</i>

127
00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.433
<i>... and every American...</i>

128
00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:25.430
<i>... that these dastardly acts</i>
<i>will not go unpunished.</i>

129
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.228
<i>Everything...</i>

130
00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:33.354
<i>... is being and will be done</i>
<i>to bring the culprit...</i>

131
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.234
<i>... or culprits to justice.</i>

132
00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.799
<i>For justice must...</i>

133
00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.112
<i>... and shall prevail.</i>

134
00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:46.037
I wish you could have known him
when I used to clerk for him.

135
00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:49.793
Last time I saw him,
only the mind was left.

136
00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.032
That's why they killed him.

137
00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.231
That mind was still a threat.

138
00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:58.518
But why kill him now,
when he had so little time left?

139
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.910
Maybe they couldn't take a chance
he'd last till the elections.

140
00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.555
So why Jensen?
This President nominated him.

141
00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.314
He and Rosenberg had almost
nothing in common.

142
00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.676
That's what they should look for.

143
00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:15.070
Decisions on which they both agreed.

144
00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:19.108
Boy, if there ever was a moment
for a drink...

145
00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.474
One day at a time, right?

146
00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:39.750
<i>We're talking a conspiracy,</i>
<i>then who are the conspirators?</i>

147
00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:44.272
If we've let foreign terrorists in,
there'll be hell to pay politically.

148
00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:48.839
The intelligence community can't be
blamed for a weakness in immigration.

149
00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.076
Denton...

150
00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:51.713
...who are your suspects?

151
00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.915
This has to be kept very quiet.

152
00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:58.159
Of course. This is the Oval Office.

153
00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:04.277
At least 11 Underground Army members
have been in the DC area...

154
00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:08.758
...and we suspect them in at least
100 bombings of abortion clinics...

155
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.434
...porno houses,
gay clubs all over the country.

156
00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.148
The truth is,
you don't have a suspect.

157
00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.109
Correct?

158
00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.433
Watch your claws.

159
00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:31.829
<i>Gray Grantham covers the Supreme Court</i>
<i>for the Washington Herald.</i>

160
00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:35.516
<i>You actually interviewed</i>
<i>Justice Rosenberg...</i>

161
00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:39.151
<i>... before he was shot on,</i>
<i>as it turned out, the day he died.</i>

162
00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:43.473
<i>Did he say anything that might shed</i>
<i>some light on these dreadful events?</i>

163
00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.312
<i>Yes. He spoke about things...</i>

164
00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:49.758
<i>... off the record,</i>
<i>appropriately for a sitting justice.</i>

165
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.719
<i>But I think it would be appropriate</i>
<i>to quote him now.</i>

166
00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:56.598
<i>He said, "The campaign waged</i>
<i>by the President was so ruthless...</i>

167
00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:00.310
<i>... in its manipulation of the</i>
<i>middle-class fears of minorities...</i>

168
00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:05.796
<i>... had been so exploitive and divisive</i>
<i>that it created a climate of distrust."</i>

169
00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:09.112
You know, that Grantham's
a man after my own heart.

170
00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:13.233
Everyone wants to know
when you're starting classes again.

171
00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:15.038
That includes me.

172
00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:20.634
You know what they say:
Drinking makes depression worse.

173
00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:24.876
What do they recommend for anguish?
Where've you been?

174
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.272
The library. I studied a printout
of the Supreme Court docket.

175
00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:30.954
I even made a list of possible suspects.

176
00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:34.317
And then threw it away
because they'd be obvious to everyone.

177
00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.156
Then you looked for areas
Jensen and Rosenberg had in common.

178
00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.310
Exactly.

179
00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:44.792
Jensen generally protected the rights
of criminal defendants.

180
00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:46.189
Some notable exceptions.

181
00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.757
He wrote 3 majority opinions
protective of the environment.

182
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.070
And almost always supported
tax protestors.

183
00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:56.799
So they might have been assassinated
by an insatiable tax collector?

184
00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.475
As yet, I rule no one out.

185
00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.993
Everyone is assuming the motive
is hatred or revenge.

186
00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.515
Or an attempt to influence
the social agenda of the court.

187
00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:09.399
What if the issue involved
old-fashioned material greed?

188
00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.915
A case that involves
a great deal of money?

189
00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.792
- Can I help you?
- I'd like to see this file, please.

190
00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:17.755
Why?

191
00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.918
It's public record, isn't it?

192
00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.479
Semi-public.

193
00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.913
Are you familiar with
the Freedom of Information Act?

194
00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.108
This file has the pleading...

195
00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:31.591
...and correspondence.
The rest is discovery and the trial.

196
00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:33.239
- When was the trial?
- Last summer.

197
00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.675
- Went on for 2 months.
- Where's the appeal?

198
00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:39.595
Not perfected yet.
I think the deadline is August 1 st.

199
00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:07.272
So, who done it?

200
00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:12.272
You have some obscure suspect unknown
to the FBI and the CIA and...

201
00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:15.717
...Secret Service
and 10,000 police departments?

202
00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.149
I had one...

203
00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:20.275
...which I have now discarded.

204
00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:25.678
You skipped class, ignored me for a
week, just to throw it away?

205
00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.114
Let me see it.

206
00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:32.759
Don't laugh. It was ludicrous of me
to think I could solve it.

207
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.797
Hubris of the young, huh?

208
00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:37.554
Don't knock the hubris that I love.

209
00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:45.232
I'm leaving tomorrow.

210
00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:49.118
I'm going up to Rosenberg's memorial
in Washington.

211
00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:56.109
I went through Rosenberg's decisions
the other night...

212
00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:00.120
...and in the back of my mind
there's an idea...

213
00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.958
...to do a book on him.

214
00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.031
No one could do it better.

215
00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.509
I started making notes...

216
00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:14.279
...about what he meant to me:
Surrogate father, mentor, you know.

217
00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:21.354
I started to get very thirsty.

218
00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.559
I deserted you this week.

219
00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:29.631
Not the greatest timing.

220
00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:32.520
You're here to study law,
not keep me sober.

221
00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:36.909
It's Alice.

222
00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:41.829
Want to come out with me for a burger?

223
00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:46.400
It might do you good to get out.

224
00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.918
I'm fine, thanks.

225
00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.235
You sure?

226
00:22:58.840 --> 00:22:59.875
Hey, Sarge.

227
00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.269
Hey, son.

228
00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:04.912
Dark coffee, three sugars.

229
00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.593
So how's the President?

230
00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.473
Which one?

231
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.399
Not Coal, the real one.

232
00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:11.959
Cool and mellow.

233
00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:15.989
Would you believe he's all tore up
about Rosenberg?

234
00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.111
And all fired up about...

235
00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:21.032
...restructuring the court.

236
00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.952
Thinks it'll make his place in history.

237
00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.077
Sounds like Coal. What'd you get me?

238
00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.950
There's a short list of nominees.

239
00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:32.273
The original had 20 or so names,
then they cut it to 8. I gave you 2.

240
00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:34.272
What about the investigation?

241
00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:36.192
I haven't heard much...

242
00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.237
...but I'll keep my ears open.

243
00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.710
- I know you will. Thanks.
- I got that.

244
00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.188
I'll see you later.

245
00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.112
Mellow, mellow, mellow.

246
00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:48.515
Martini, please.

247
00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.990
Good day. Good to see you.

248
00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:54.755
Another coffee, please.

249
00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:57.598
You read the Grantham article.

250
00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:00.349
It had me running around all day.

251
00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:04.918
Coal blasted the Director, saying the
judges' names were leaked by the FBI.

252
00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:09.233
The Director said Coal had leaked them
himself to test the waters.

253
00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.872
Coal ran the most divisive campaign
in 20 years...

254
00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:14.519
...and the President did nothing.

255
00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.158
I'd like to have seen your name
on this list of judges.

256
00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.359
We all voted you
most likely to make the court.

257
00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:26.836
These days, it's hard enough
just to make my class.

258
00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.388
How old is she, this time?

259
00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:33.150
Twenty-four. But she's...

260
00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:34.794
...extremely mature.

261
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.070
At 24, she's mature.

262
00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.959
I don't know if I believe that.
Do you have a photo?

263
00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:45.272
No, I don't. She's not a puppy dog
or a grandchild.

264
00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:46.915
Thank God.

265
00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.353
Who killed them, Gavin?

266
00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:54.476
I'm just a lawyer with the Bureau,
I'm not an agent.

267
00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:57.351
But, as I recall, you have great ears.

268
00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:01.149
To be honest, we don't have a clue.

269
00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.878
My girlfriend wrote
a very interesting essay...

270
00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:10.157
...on who might have ordered
the assassinations.

271
00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:11.913
Your girlfriend has a theory?

272
00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:18.391
Here, take a look at it. You'll get
a kick out of the way her mind works.

273
00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:39.552
<i>- Is this Gray Grantham?</i>
- Yes, it is.

274
00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:44.157
<i>Sorry to call at such a crazy hour.</i>
<i>I'm at a pay phone on my way to work.</i>

275
00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:47.358
<i>I can't call from home or the office.</i>

276
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.319
What kind of office?

277
00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.074
<i>I'm an attorney.</i>

278
00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.073
Private or government?

279
00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.073
<i>I'd rather not say.</i>

280
00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:58.559
<i>I may know something</i>
<i>about Rosenberg and Jensen.</i>

281
00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:01.273
<i>Are you recording this?</i>

282
00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:04.111
<i>Can this call be traced?</i>

283
00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:07.511
I'm not recording it or tracing it.
I promise you.

284
00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.836
<i>I may know who killed them.</i>

285
00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:13.593
What's your name?

286
00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:16.029
<i>Garcia.</i>

287
00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.072
That's not your real name.

288
00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:26.279
<i>I think I saw something at the office</i>
<i>I wasn't supposed to see.</i>

289
00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:29.593
Do you have a copy?

290
00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:34.111
<i>I need to think about this.</i>

291
00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.316
- I understand.
<i>- I'm not thinking rationally.</i>

292
00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:39.757
Listen, I promise you...

293
00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:43.718
...I will protect you
as a confidential source.

294
00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:07.715
Got you.

295
00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:18.553
Mr. Grantham's not here,
but he left his car number for you.

296
00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.438
I still don't know what to do.

297
00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:26.799
<i>Mr. Garcia...</i>

298
00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:31.149
<i>... I've gone to jail</i>
<i>rather than reveal a source.</i>

299
00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:34.509
I know what kind of hell
this must be for you.

300
00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:38.758
You're clearly a decent human being,
a good citizen.

301
00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:43.235
But could you live with yourself
if you don't reveal what you know?

302
00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:47.074
I'll get back to you.

303
00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:19.549
Taxi!

304
00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:31.558
French authorities reviewed footage
from the airport cameras in Paris...

305
00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:35.839
...and think they recognized a face
that might be Khamel's, the terrorist.

306
00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:40.631
He may have arrived here on a flight
10 hours after we found Jensen's body.

307
00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:43.515
Anything else?

308
00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:46.397
Maybe a small new wrinkle.

309
00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:49.793
What's the wrinkle?

310
00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:52.958
It's a theory that surfaced
in the last 24 hours.

311
00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.156
Voyles is really intrigued by it.

312
00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:58.429
He's afraid it might be damaging
to the President.

313
00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:02.989
How's that?

314
00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:05.231
It's all there in the brief.

315
00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:15.508
It's amateur stuff...

316
00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:19.510
...but how often does something make
Coal sweat and run for cover?

317
00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.354
He didn't exactly sweat in front of us.

318
00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:25.194
But his stone face showed
he wasn't happy.

319
00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:26.793
Did he have any symptoms?

320
00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:30.510
As I told you, the President is here
for his annual checkup.

321
00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:32.352
I wish I was in as good shape.

322
00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:35.319
Was this timed to counter the age
issue in the next election?

323
00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:37.232
Why didn't I think of that?

324
00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:39.436
He hasn't decided whether to run again.

325
00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:41.238
When will he decide?

326
00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:44.040
Do you really expect me to answer that?

327
00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:48.239
One rumor I can deny is
that he checked in to get away from you.

328
00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:50.119
Although could you blame him?

329
00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:53.508
Thank you again.

330
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.152
Commander, go downstairs and tell them
I have a date for golf this afternoon.

331
00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:00.594
Yes, sir!

332
00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:04.390
It's killing the press
you're so healthy.

333
00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:07.074
Good. Now, what's so important?

334
00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.108
This is...

335
00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:10.913
...a brief...

336
00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:14.033
...written by an eager-beaver
law student.

337
00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:16.714
It's a theory about the assassinations.

338
00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:18.954
And indirectly...

339
00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.719
...it implicates the White House.

340
00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:26.113
The premise is so far-fetched
it's absurd.

341
00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:30.076
But Director Voyles, for reasons
both you and I can guess...

342
00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:31.230
...is going after it.

343
00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:37.231
Well, we...

344
00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:40.278
We can't interfere
with his investigation.

345
00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:43.120
You should ask Giminski
to have the CIA investigate.

346
00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:48.357
When we confirm that this is garbage,
you can ask Voyles to back off.

347
00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:50.753
It's domestic.

348
00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:55.197
The CIA can't go nosing around.
It's illegal.

349
00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:57.148
Technically.

350
00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:01.155
What about...

351
00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:02.753
...your friend...

352
00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:06.316
...Barr, and the Unit,
I think you call it.

353
00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:08.598
I've spoken to Barr.

354
00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:11.590
They're very good
for small specific missions...

355
00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:13.598
...but they aren't the CIA.

356
00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:17.672
How does it implicate the White House?
What are there, names?

357
00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:20.229
One name.

358
00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:24.071
Someone we both know?

359
00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:58.028
I've decided my agenda for the future.

360
00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:00.311
I'll stay in bed...

361
00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.154
...drink...

362
00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:04.269
...make love...

363
00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.508
...and forget the whole damn business.

364
00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:12.078
You don't approve.

365
00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:15.032
What about the book on Rosenberg?

366
00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:17.038
You should write it.

367
00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:19.952
- Let's go.
- You should.

368
00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:23.237
You have the youth, the energy,
the certitude.

369
00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:24.913
You'd be perfect.

370
00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:27.074
Can I have the keys?

371
00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:35.480
I'm perfectly capable of driving.

372
00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:37.991
You've drunk too much.

373
00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:43.148
Give me the keys.

374
00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:47.674
- Do you remember the Mashed Potato?
- Give me the keys.

375
00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:49.512
- You're too young.
- I know it.

376
00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:51.955
Do you remember the Fishback?

377
00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:54.156
- The Slide?
- No. Please.

378
00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.436
- Please what?
- Give me the keys.

379
00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:59.399
Give me the keys.
I'll drive or I'll walk.

380
00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:00.914
You'll walk?

381
00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:05.438
Have a nice stroll.

382
00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.268
Miss Shaw!

383
00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:21.120
You take my breath away!

384
00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:29.428
Thomas!

385
00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.630
Oh, my God!

386
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:53.910
Watch the door.

387
00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:00.594
I'm Sergeant Rupert, NOPD.

388
00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:03.711
You'll be safe in my car.

389
00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:09.149
Your name?

390
00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:18.119
Darby Shaw.

391
00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:23.635
Let's go.

392
00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:31.830
Is this your car?

393
00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:36.871
Come here.

394
00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:40.278
I'm Lieutenant Olsen, NOPD.

395
00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:42.911
I'm taking you to the hospital.

396
00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:44.988
Check the plates.

397
00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:47.919
Did you know the man in the car?

398
00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:55.109
Thomas Callahan.

399
00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.072
It'll be a few minutes.

400
00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:14.476
Are you sure that the man who called
himself Rupert said he was a cop?

401
00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:22.117
We don't have a record of a cop
named Rupert. The computer...

402
00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:26.876
...has no record of the tag numbers of
the car you were in. Must be fake.

403
00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:31.349
I'll go move the car. I'll be back.

404
00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:32.789
All right?

405
00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:34.434
<i>Gavin Verheek?</i>

406
00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:37.914
<i>This is Darby Shaw.</i>
<i>Do you know who I am?</i>

407
00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:40.628
We have a mutual friend.

408
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.468
<i>Thomas gave you a copy of my theory.</i>

409
00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:44.789
Yes, he did.

410
00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:46.314
<i>Where is it?</i>

411
00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:50.117
I read it and I showed it
to some folks at the Bureau...

412
00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:52.430
...who sent it to Director Voyles.

413
00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:55.069
<i>Has it been seen outside of the FBI?</i>

414
00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:57.151
I can't answer that.

415
00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:00.119
<i>Then I won't tell you</i>
<i>what's happened to Thomas.</i>

416
00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:07.549
It's been seen outside the FBI,
but by whom I don't know.

417
00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:09.993
<i>He's dead, Gavin.</i>

418
00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:13.357
<i>He was murdered. Someone planted</i>
<i>a car bomb for both of us.</i>

419
00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:15.989
<i>I got lucky, but they're after me.</i>

420
00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:20.350
What's your phone number?
Where are you?

421
00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:22.113
<i>Not so fast.</i>

422
00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:25.837
Come on! Thomas Callahan
was my best friend.

423
00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:30.114
I'll have agents pick you up.
You can't stay on the street.

424
00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:34.075
<i>Thomas is dead because he talked</i>
<i>to you. Tell that to Voyles.</i>

425
00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:37.517
Turn up the TV,
I can't hear Regis and Kathie Lee.

426
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.115
Mr. President.

427
00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:54.757
Sit down. You must see this.
We've been working on this all morning.

428
00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.592
You have your first audience.

429
00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.070
Over. Roll over.

430
00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:01.834
Roll over.

431
00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:04.389
How serious is this Pelican thing?

432
00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:07.510
I've assigned 14 agents in New Orleans.

433
00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:11.116
I doubt if there's anything to it,
but we must check it out.

434
00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:13.072
I don't have to tell you...

435
00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:16.756
...how much trouble and pain
this nonsense could cause...

436
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.831
...if the press gets wind of it.

437
00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:22.272
Oh, well, you got half of it.
Good boy.

438
00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:26.233
I just wish...

439
00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:27.833
...that you'd...

440
00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:29.798
...back off the thing...

441
00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:31.795
I mean...

442
00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:34.076
...it's a goose chase.

443
00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:37.153
Are you asking me to ignore a suspect,
Mr. President?

444
00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:40.679
If the press...

445
00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:43.673
...gets wind of what you're after
and starts digging, I'll be...

446
00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:45.069
We'll be crucified.

447
00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:52.396
So you're asking me to back off?

448
00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:58.629
Back off and chase the real suspects.

449
00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:01.955
Ignore it for a few weeks, that's all.

450
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.278
Your hatchet man did a real number on me
with the press. They ate my lunch...

451
00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:08.913
...over the security...

452
00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:11.515
...we provided Jensen and Rosenberg.

453
00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:17.436
Get that pit bull off my ass and
I'll forget the Pelican theory a while.

454
00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:33.828
May I have your card?

455
00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:37.311
I'll pay with cash.

456
00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:44.311
What did Voyles say?

457
00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:47.948
<i>Mr. Voyles has been unavailable.</i>

458
00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:50.919
<i>But I will try to speak to him</i>
<i>later this afternoon.</i>

459
00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:55.632
I expected more.

460
00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:58.475
<i>There's a memorial service tomorrow.</i>

461
00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:00.790
<i>I'll be there tonight.</i>

462
00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:02.598
<i>I think we should meet.</i>

463
00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:05.435
<i>Darby, I can save your life.</i>

464
00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:08.515
You can't even talk to the Director.

465
00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:13.158
Where will you stay?

466
00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:16.195
<i>At the Westin, by the river.</i>

467
00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:48.712
She's watching TV.

468
00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:52.471
They've been looking under rocks.
She's using credit cards.

469
00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:54.551
She'll be dead in 48 hours.

470
00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:56.472
I'll give her 72.

471
00:44:57.800 --> 00:44:59.472
We'll meet at 6 A.M.

472
00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:00.955
All right.

473
00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:04.157
Hooten, stay.

474
00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:13.510
This means her little brief
is right on point.

475
00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:16.597
Will you notify the President?

476
00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:19.351
Notifying the President...

477
00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:21.551
...means notifying Coal.

478
00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:25.516
<i>Gray Grantham 's article</i>
<i>in tomorrow's Washington Herald...</i>

479
00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:28.274
<i>... maintains that, according</i>
<i>to unnamed White House sources...</i>

480
00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:30.829
<i>... the Mid-Eastern terrorist, Khamel...</i>

481
00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:35.392
<i>... may be among those who assassinated</i>
<i>Justices Rosenberg and Jensen.</i>

482
00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:40.156
<i>Those sources say that a country known</i>
<i>for sponsoring terrorist activity...</i>

483
00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:41.799
<i>... may have hired Khamel.</i>

484
00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:48.309
<i>It's Garcia.</i>

485
00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:51.313
<i>I'm on the corner of</i>
<i>Pennsylvania Avenue and First.</i>

486
00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:55.719
Take down my license number;
there's a lot of gray Volvos out there.

487
00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:57.553
8-5-6...

488
00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:00.632
...V-N-N.

489
00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:03.755
Right.

490
00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:05.469
Ten minutes.

491
00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:14.799
My keys!

492
00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:21.278
<i>I can't do it.</i>

493
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.275
Let's get together anyway.

494
00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:31.036
You'll feel better if we meet
and you don't have to reveal anything.

495
00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:32.998
<i>I have a wife and daughter.</i>

496
00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:35.995
<i>There's a chance they know that I know.</i>

497
00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:37.434
The guys at the firm?

498
00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:40.274
<i>I didn't tell you I was in a firm.</i>

499
00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:43.598
You go to work too early
to be a government lawyer.

500
00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:46.877
You must work at a firm
where they expect people...

501
00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:49.111
...to work at least 100 hours a week.

502
00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:13.077
Garcia, we can work this thing out
if you just get together with me.

503
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.319
<i>Garcia?</i>

504
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.228
Who's this?

505
00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:20.318
<i>Is this Gray Grantham?</i>

506
00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:22.073
Yes. Who's this?

507
00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:25.595
<i>Have you heard of the Pelican Brief?</i>

508
00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:27.269
The what?

509
00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:29.353
<i>Pelican Brief.</i>

510
00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:33.953
Never heard of it.

511
00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:38.235
<i>It's an unlikely little theory</i>
<i>about who killed Rosenberg and Jensen.</i>

512
00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:40.710
<i>A friend of mine took it to Washington.</i>

513
00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:43.872
<i>He gave it to a friend in the FBI</i>
<i>and it was passed around.</i>

514
00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:46.554
<i>My friend was killed in a car bomb.</i>

515
00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:48.468
Wait now.

516
00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:51.788
Your friend took it to the FBI...

517
00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:54.395
...and then he was killed?
What's his name?

518
00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:57.798
<i>I can't tell you that.</i>

519
00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:00.870
How do you know all this?

520
00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:02.912
<i>I wrote the brief.</i>

521
00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:06.153
Are you a lawyer?

522
00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:10.398
Where are you calling from?

523
00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:14.278
<i>I'd rather you not</i>
<i>ask me any more questions.</i>

524
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.672
You called me.

525
00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:18.114
What's your name?

526
00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:21.195
<i>- Alice.</i>
- You called me, Alice.

527
00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:26.553
<i>Can you get a list of the major</i>
<i>presidential campaign contributors?</i>

528
00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:30.114
Yes. Sure.
I can have it tomorrow.

529
00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:33.790
You know who did these killings?

530
00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:35.874
<i>Yes.</i>

531
00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:40.070
Let's cut to the chase.
Who did it?

532
00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:42.870
<i>Let's take it slow.</i>
<i>I'll be in touch.</i>

533
00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:44.075
When?

534
00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:19.108
How are you?

535
00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:21.312
How are you?

536
00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:25.038
Did you get into my apartment?

537
00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:27.639
Your computer's gone.

538
00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:30.153
So are your floppy disks.

539
00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:32.516
And your red expandable files.

540
00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:36.956
I need you to do me a favor.

541
00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:40.480
Go to the memorial service tomorrow...

542
00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:45.797
...and spread the word I called to say
I'm staying with an aunt in Denver.

543
00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:48.550
And I won't be back until fall.

544
00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:52.313
What is going on?

545
00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:58.951
Are you okay about money?

546
00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:02.828
I have the money my father left me.

547
00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:07.112
Who are you hiding from?

548
00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:14.475
I think you better go now, Alice.

549
00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:24.478
It would be better for me if you go now.

550
00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:43.278
That's not fair.

551
00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:46.792
The prettiest girl in the Quarter,
the saddest girl in the Quarter.

552
00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:51.834
I can't get you to give me a smile?

553
00:50:57.120 --> 00:50:58.269
I saw that.

554
00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:00.079
That's something.

555
00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:09.799
Just one beer?

556
00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:14.071
I've found my mission in life.

557
00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:15.679
To make you smile.

558
00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:17.876
You must find another mission.

559
00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:27.349
Wait!

560
00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:30.789
Will you marry me, just for 5 minutes?

561
00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:34.271
I know it's stupid,
but I think we're fated for each other.

562
00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:35.873
I must go now.

563
00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:39.032
Please, you're not going to
walk out on me, are you?

564
00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:41.556
<i>I'd walk a million miles</i>

565
00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:43.677
<i>For one of your smiles</i>

566
00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:45.148
<i>You beautiful</i>

567
00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:46.628
<i>You wonderful girl</i>

568
00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:49.110
<i>From the laundry</i>

569
00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:53.359
You've got the wrong girl.

570
00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:57.195
Go get her.

571
00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:28.312
Please, help me!

572
00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:16.358
Looking for Mr. Sneller.

573
00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:17.715
Mr. Sneller?

574
00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:20.428
Yes, Mr. Edwin F. Sneller.

575
00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:13.071
Have you heard from Darby?

576
00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:14.469
Yes, I did.

577
00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:18.190
I got a note from her.
She's staying with an aunt in Colorado.

578
00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:21.398
But she's going to
be back next semester.

579
00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:34.159
I'll see you later.

580
00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:01.032
<i>Gavin, it's Darby.</i>

581
00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:04.869
I'd just about given up on you.

582
00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:08.598
Tell me where you want to meet
and I'll come with 3 agents.

583
00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:10.876
<i>I thought the FBI was not involved.</i>

584
00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:14.078
It's not involved, not yet.
I have friends.

585
00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:17.511
We can get you out of the city tonight,
in Washington tomorrow.

586
00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:20.035
I promise you'll meet Voyles.

587
00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:21.599
We'll go from there.

588
00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:25.073
<i>At noon tomorrow,</i>
<i>take the trolley to Riverwalk.</i>

589
00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:26.799
Wait, Riverwalk?

590
00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:30.398
<i>Wear a long sleeve shirt</i>
<i>and a red baseball cap.</i>

591
00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:33.953
<i>Wait on the riverside</i>
<i>at the bandstand...</i>

592
00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:35.713
<i>... and I'll find you.</i>

593
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:37.831
The riverside bandstand.

594
00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:41.756
<i>- How tall are you?</i>
- 5' 10".

595
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:42.989
<i>Your weight?</i>

596
00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:46.034
About 180,
but I'm planning on losing it.

597
00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:47.952
<i>I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

598
00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:49.269
Tomorrow.

599
00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:05.959
<i>Gavin, it's Darby.</i>

600
00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:08.351
<i>I'd just about given up on you.</i>

601
00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:12.472
<i>Tell me where you want to meet</i>
<i>and I'll come with 3 agents.</i>

602
00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:16.400
<i>I thought the FBI was not involved.</i>

603
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.513
<i>It's not involved, not yet.</i>

604
00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:20.713
<i>I have friends.</i>

605
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:24.197
<i>We'll get you out of the city tonight,</i>
<i>in Washington tomorrow.</i>

606
00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:27.355
<i>I promise you'll meet Voyles.</i>

607
00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:29.392
<i>We'll go from there.</i>

608
00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:33.189
<i>At noon tomorrow,</i>
<i>take the trolley to Riverwalk.</i>

609
00:58:34.920 --> 00:58:37.036
<i>Wear a long sleeve shirt</i>
<i>and a red baseball cap.</i>

610
00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:41.038
<i>Wait on the riverside at the bandstand</i>
<i>and I'll find you.</i>

611
00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:43.358
<i>The riverside bandstand?</i>

612
00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:47.837
<i>- How tall are you?</i>
<i>- 5' 10".</i>

613
00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:49.149
<i>Your weight?</i>

614
00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:52.034
<i>About 180,</i>
<i>but I'm planning on losing it.</i>

615
00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:54.515
<i>All right.</i>

616
00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:01.032
Tell me where you want to meet...

617
00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:05.272
Tell me where you want to meet...

618
00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:08.598
...and within an hour
I'll come get you with 3 agents.

619
01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:37.115
<i>Mr. Sneller on line 2.</i>

620
01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:44.319
<i>Khamel is dead.</i>
<i>We don't know who did it.</i>

621
01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:46.598
- And the girl?
<i>- She's running.</i>

622
01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:49.035
<i>We lost her.</i>
<i>We'll find her.</i>

623
01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:06.518
<i>There's been another murder.</i>

624
01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:11.232
<i>You remember my friend gave</i>
<i>the brief to a friend at the FBI?</i>

625
01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:15.074
<i>The FBI friend was killed yesterday.</i>

626
01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:17.989
How do you know?

627
01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:21.909
<i>I was holding his hand.</i>
<i>He was shot...</i>

628
01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:24.390
<i>... in broad daylight</i>
<i>in a crowd.</i>

629
01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.433
I'm very sorry.

630
01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.389
<i>I'm in New York now.</i>
<i>When can you come?</i>

631
01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:33.837
You'll have to give me
something I can confirm.

632
01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:38.876
We get crank calls from people claiming
to know who killed Rosenberg and Jensen.

633
01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:41.317
<i>Something you can confirm?</i>

634
01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:42.515
Please.

635
01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:44.319
<i>Such as?</i>

636
01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:48.078
The name of the friend
that was murdered in the car explosion.

637
01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:53.109
Take your time.

638
01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:56.069
<i>Callahan.</i>

639
01:03:58.160 --> 01:03:59.559
His first name?

640
01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:00.835
<i>Thomas.</i>

641
01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:02.992
Where did it happen?

642
01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:06.637
<i>In New Orleans.</i>
<i>I think that should be enough.</i>

643
01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:10.555
All right.

644
01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:16.914
What's the name of the friend
that worked at the FBI?

645
01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:18.913
<i>Verheek.</i>

646
01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:20.833
<i>Gavin Verheek.</i>

647
01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:23.233
Voyles' chief counsel.

648
01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:25.637
<i>I think that's more than enough.</i>

649
01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:29.552
I'll be on a plane this afternoon.

650
01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:32.314
<i>You must follow my instructions.</i>

651
01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:47.319
This is Gray Grantham.

652
01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:51.189
That's right.

653
01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:56.315
Got it.

654
01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:14.111
Did you follow my instructions?

655
01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:47.592
You must think I'm crazy.

656
01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:50.479
Yes, I did...

657
01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:54.511
...till I checked New Orleans.

658
01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:56.838
Callahan was...

659
01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:59.031
...killed exactly as you said.

660
01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:02.750
I also checked Verheek.
According to the FBI...

661
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.434
...they found his body 2 days ago...

662
01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:07.910
...in a hotel room early in the morning.

663
01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:12.309
He'd been dead for at least 8 hours.

664
01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:15.554
That can't be.

665
01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:19.877
Want to talk about the brief?

666
01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:24.994
Everyone I've told
about the brief is dead.

667
01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:27.838
I'll take my chances.

668
01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:32.231
You can't, under any circumstances,
use my name...

669
01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:35.309
...or reveal how you got
the information.

670
01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:38.711
Or publish anything until
I've left the country. Agreed?

671
01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:41.078
Unless I can convince you otherwise.

672
01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:42.514
You can't.

673
01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:47.355
May I sit down?

674
01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:52.878
Mind if I use a tape recorder?

675
01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:06.436
Interesting read, isn't it?

676
01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:09.833
What'd the President say?

677
01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:12.911
He spoke to Voyles...

678
01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:16.515
...who will leave it alone for a while.

679
01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:19.874
The President asked Voyles to back off?

680
01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:24.268
We thought it was just another shot
in the dark. Now I'm not sure.

681
01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:26.512
That's obstruction of justice.

682
01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:28.637
Assuming the brief turns out to be true.

683
01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:31.876
If it does, you'll be the fall guy.

684
01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:37.158
I won't be the only one.

685
01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:39.631
The old Nixon two-step.

686
01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:42.038
Don't even think that name.

687
01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:45.393
Look at the hopeful side,
Irangate, Iraqgate...

688
01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:47.517
Good chance it won't come out.

689
01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:50.392
What's up with Grantham?

690
01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:53.999
We got his car phone.
We haven't been inside the home yet.

691
01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.035
Why not?

692
01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:59.319
We almost got caught
by the cleaning lady.

693
01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:05.869
Grantham knows about the brief.

694
01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:08.749
He called 3 White House aides today...

695
01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:10.833
...and God knows who else.

696
01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:14.473
What made you hone in
on this particular case so quickly?

697
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.959
I remembered this piece
that "Frontline" did a year ago...

698
01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:24.870
...about the young lawyer
who originally filed the suit.

699
01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:30.836
They said he'd committed suicide,
but his family thought it was foul play.

700
01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:38.917
After the assassinations,
I called his family.

701
01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:42.994
They said he had
a depressive problem years before...

702
01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:45.800
...but medication had taken care of it.

703
01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:49.919
His doctor confirmed
what the family said.

704
01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.310
They told the police
they were not convinced it was suicide.

705
01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:59.590
But the police
closed the investigation.

706
01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:03.348
Exactly.

707
01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:11.834
That's it.
That's the brief.

708
01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:17.593
Maybe we could...

709
01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:20.310
...finish up in the morning?

710
01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:33.750
I'll be up late going over my notes...

711
01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.592
...while they're fresh in my head.

712
01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:39.074
Call me when you wake up.

713
01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:44.552
Try and get some sleep.

714
01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:00.316
I know it sounds silly, but...

715
01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:04.110
...would you sleep on the sofa?

716
01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:09.909
No problem.

717
01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:17.949
Good night.

718
01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:20.474
Listen...

719
01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:23.760
At the risk of sounding old-fashioned...

720
01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:26.919
...isn't it time I knew your real name?

721
01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:30.828
Darby Shaw.

722
01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:34.870
What made you pick me,
Darby Shaw?

723
01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:40.117
Callahan was a fan.

724
01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:52.793
<i>Does the name Victor Mattiece</i>
<i>mean anything to you?</i>

725
01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:54.390
<i>Money.</i>

726
01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:55.516
<i>Power.</i>

727
01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:57.708
<i>Influence.</i>

728
01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:03.436
<i>He's made and lost several fortunes</i>
<i>drilling for oil in south Louisiana.</i>

729
01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:06.313
<i>In 1979...</i>

730
01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:10.714
<i>... his oil company punched some holes</i>
<i>in Terrebonne Parish and hit oil.</i>

731
01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:12.075
<i>A lot of oil.</i>

732
01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:14.995
<i>He needed governmental permission...</i>

733
01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:19.279
<i>... to dredge a channel though</i>
<i>the marshlands to get the oil out.</i>

734
01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:22.753
<i>Enter Mattiece,</i>
<i>the great campaign contributor...</i>

735
01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:24.594
<i>... and as night follows day...</i>

736
01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:28.230
<i>... government permission</i>
<i>to gouge through the endangered marshes.</i>

737
01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:32.957
<i>Mattiece is that close</i>
<i>to at least a billion dollars...</i>

738
01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:34.394
<i>... when Green Fund...</i>

739
01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:36.671
<i>... an obscure environmental outfit...</i>

740
01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:40.913
<i>... trots down to the U. S. District court</i>
<i>in Lafayette and files a lawsuit...</i>

741
01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:43.310
<i>... to stop the entire operation.</i>

742
01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:46.957
<i>Of course, Mattiece spares no expense</i>
<i>to win the lawsuit.</i>

743
01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:51.558
<i>I don't think there's a top law firm</i>
<i>between Houston and New Orleans...</i>

744
01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:53.518
<i>... that he hasn't hired.</i>

745
01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:56.037
Fucking PBS!

746
01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:58.948
<i>By the time the Green Fund lawyers...</i>

747
01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:00.189
<i>... all two of them...</i>

748
01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:02.271
<i>... wade in, the joint ventures...</i>

749
01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:05.552
<i>... limited partnerships and corporate</i>
<i>associations...</i>

750
01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:08.837
<i>... form an impenetrable maze</i>
<i>that makes Mattiece invisible.</i>

751
01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:12.115
<i>Luckily for the Green Fund's lawsuit...</i>

752
01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:16.717
<i>... the heart of the new oil reserve</i>
<i>is near a natural refuge for waterfowl:</i>

753
01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:21.358
<i>Osprey, egrets, pelicans,</i>
<i>ducks, cranes, geese.</i>

754
01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:24.030
<i>The pelican becomes the hero.</i>

755
01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:28.558
<i>After 30 years of contamination</i>
<i>by DDT and other pesticides...</i>

756
01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:32.039
<i>... the Louisiana brown pelican is</i>
<i>on the brink of extinction.</i>

757
01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:35.512
<i>Green Fund seizes the bird</i>
<i>and enlists experts...</i>

758
01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:38.513
<i>... from around the country</i>
<i>to testify on its behalf.</i>

759
01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:43.518
<i>It takes 7 years for the pelican suit</i>
<i>to go to trial in Lake Charles.</i>

760
01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:47.789
<i>The 3-man jury, caring less</i>
<i>about the pelicans than jobs...</i>

761
01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:50.031
<i>... votes in favor of Mattiece.</i>

762
01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:55.039
<i>But the judge rules to keep the</i>
<i>injunction against drilling because...</i>

763
01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:58.357
<i>... he thinks Green Fund has proven</i>
<i>its point about the pelican...</i>

764
01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:02.639
<i>... a federally-protected species,</i>
<i>and that it will appeal.</i>

765
01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:04.268
<i>What's the lawsuit's status?</i>

766
01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:07.038
<i>From the trial level...</i>

767
01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:11.034
<i>... it will be appealed to the Court</i>
<i>of Appeals in New Orleans in a month.</i>

768
01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:14.271
<i>Any idea what the court will do?</i>

769
01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:16.152
<i>It could be reversed.</i>

770
01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:21.031
<i>Then the fun starts. If either side</i>
<i>is unhappy with the court...</i>

771
01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:23.316
<i>... they can appeal</i>
<i>to the Supreme Court.</i>

772
01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:27.599
<i>From today, how long would it take</i>
<i>for a decision by the Supreme Court?</i>

773
01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:30.190
<i>Anywhere from 3 to 5 years.</i>

774
01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:32.237
<i>Rosenberg would have died.</i>

775
01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:36.553
<i>But another President could be</i>
<i>in the White House when he died.</i>

776
01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:38.233
<i>So if you're Mattiece...</i>

777
01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:41.398
<i>... and you don't mind killing</i>
<i>a couple of Supremes...</i>

778
01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:45.189
<i>... now's the time to kill them,</i>
<i>when you can predict their replacement.</i>

779
01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:46.714
<i>But why Jensen?</i>

780
01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:49.997
<i>He shared one piece</i>
<i>of common ground with Rosenberg:</i>

781
01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:51.798
<i>Protecting the environment.</i>

782
01:14:32.789 --> 01:14:34.268
I didn't mean to wake you.

783
01:14:42.669 --> 01:14:47.220
You said that Mattiece hired law firms
from Houston to New Orleans.

784
01:14:48.349 --> 01:14:50.226
Were there any in Washington?

785
01:14:51.469 --> 01:14:52.345
Maybe two.

786
01:14:54.629 --> 01:14:56.028
White & Blazevich...

787
01:14:58.749 --> 01:15:01.183
...and Brim, Stearns & Somebody.

788
01:15:02.509 --> 01:15:03.464
Great!

789
01:15:04.429 --> 01:15:06.738
I got a call from a lawyer in DC...

790
01:15:06.989 --> 01:15:09.219
...who saw something
concerning Rosenberg and Jensen.

791
01:15:09.989 --> 01:15:13.106
He backed out of our meeting.
I never heard from him again.

792
01:15:14.109 --> 01:15:17.146
He gave me a phony name,
but I got his picture.

793
01:15:17.909 --> 01:15:18.898
How?

794
01:15:19.149 --> 01:15:23.267
Long story. If he works at one of these
law firms, he could be our confirmation.

795
01:15:24.589 --> 01:15:25.988
I hope you find him.

796
01:15:27.669 --> 01:15:29.500
Come with me to Washington.

797
01:15:31.749 --> 01:15:32.864
I've had enough.

798
01:15:34.349 --> 01:15:37.341
If you're right about Mattiece,
then there'll be a cover-up.

799
01:15:37.589 --> 01:15:38.988
It'll probably work.

800
01:15:39.309 --> 01:15:40.503
How do you know?

801
01:15:41.029 --> 01:15:43.543
I called the Herald morgue last night.

802
01:15:44.109 --> 01:15:46.782
Two years ago, a reporter
did a piece...

803
01:15:47.029 --> 01:15:50.146
...on "Violations of
Campaign Financing Laws."

804
01:15:50.629 --> 01:15:54.417
He found out that, hidden under
a lot of other names of individuals...

805
01:15:54.669 --> 01:15:59.220
...and PAC's and corporations,
Mattiece was the biggest contributor...

806
01:15:59.469 --> 01:16:00.618
...by far...

807
01:16:00.869 --> 01:16:02.507
...to the President's campaign.

808
01:16:02.789 --> 01:16:06.338
We ran a picture, with the article,
of the President and Mattiece.

809
01:16:06.989 --> 01:16:09.423
It was taken unbeknownst to either one.

810
01:16:09.749 --> 01:16:13.025
In it, the President and Mattiece are
in front of Mattiece's hunting lodge...

811
01:16:13.269 --> 01:16:15.908
...sipping on some bourbon,
having a good laugh.

812
01:16:16.149 --> 01:16:17.582
The best of pals.

813
01:16:17.829 --> 01:16:20.468
The captions said:
"The President's Most Secret...

814
01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:23.223
...and Generous Contributor."

815
01:16:24.669 --> 01:16:28.218
Now if your brief is right
and it ever reaches the light of day...

816
01:16:28.469 --> 01:16:30.937
...the President loses
any chance of reelection.

817
01:16:31.189 --> 01:16:33.749
The men around the President
won't let that happen.

818
01:16:33.989 --> 01:16:38.028
I checked with my sources.
The Bureau, Langley, the White House...

819
01:16:38.269 --> 01:16:40.863
...all said the brief doesn't exist.

820
01:16:42.669 --> 01:16:47.140
You may be the only witness to the fact
there is a brief. If you disappear...

821
01:16:47.389 --> 01:16:48.822
...so does justice.

822
01:16:52.349 --> 01:16:54.340
Is that what Callahan would want?

823
01:16:57.829 --> 01:17:00.184
He'd want me to see my 25th birthday.

824
01:17:03.749 --> 01:17:07.742
If this thing reaches as deep
and goes as high as we think it does...

825
01:17:07.989 --> 01:17:10.298
...they'll do anything
not to be exposed.

826
01:17:12.229 --> 01:17:13.628
Where can you hide?

827
01:17:13.869 --> 01:17:15.461
Go back to Washington.

828
01:17:24.829 --> 01:17:28.458
They're all shook up
about you asking about something.

829
01:17:28.709 --> 01:17:29.585
I expected that.

830
01:17:29.829 --> 01:17:32.423
It's like the Gestapo over there.
Coal clears everything.

831
01:17:32.669 --> 01:17:34.944
They put me on medical leave
for 90 days.

832
01:17:35.269 --> 01:17:37.305
- What's wrong with you?
- I don't know.

833
01:17:37.629 --> 01:17:40.905
One thing I do know,
I've never seen it this bad.

834
01:17:41.149 --> 01:17:42.980
I'm worried about you, son.

835
01:17:47.229 --> 01:17:48.742
<i>Gray, it's Darby.</i>

836
01:17:48.989 --> 01:17:52.026
<i>When you hear this, I'll be in the air</i>
<i>on my way to nowhere.</i>

837
01:17:54.589 --> 01:17:56.022
<i>Try to understand.</i>

838
01:17:57.549 --> 01:17:59.460
<i>I can't keep you on that story.</i>

839
01:17:59.909 --> 01:18:01.467
I'm sending you to Arkansas.

840
01:18:01.869 --> 01:18:03.541
The Times, the networks...

841
01:18:03.789 --> 01:18:07.259
...are there checking out the judge
they're about to nominate.

842
01:18:07.509 --> 01:18:08.385
I need more time.

843
01:18:08.869 --> 01:18:09.858
For what?

844
01:18:10.109 --> 01:18:14.819
You lost your White House sources,
you've lost Garcia and the girl.

845
01:18:15.069 --> 01:18:16.741
Not your best week.

846
01:18:17.589 --> 01:18:19.420
You can't take me off this story.

847
01:18:21.429 --> 01:18:22.782
What do you know for fact?

848
01:18:23.029 --> 01:18:26.385
An unidentified guy says
he knows about the assassinations.

849
01:18:26.629 --> 01:18:30.986
He works in a law firm, you don't know
which one. He's cut off all contact.

850
01:18:31.229 --> 01:18:33.299
That's not very promising.

851
01:18:33.749 --> 01:18:36.058
There's something there, I can smell it.

852
01:18:37.189 --> 01:18:41.785
Evidence based on olfactory prowess is
inadmissible, in case you didn't know.

853
01:18:42.029 --> 01:18:43.257
Then there's a girl...

854
01:18:43.509 --> 01:18:46.182
...with her bird brief for which
you can't get confirmation.

855
01:18:46.429 --> 01:18:46.986
Not yet.

856
01:18:47.229 --> 01:18:51.268
She also cut off contact, something
that's reaching epidemic proportions.

857
01:18:51.509 --> 01:18:53.306
<i>They're waiting for you upstairs.</i>

858
01:18:53.589 --> 01:18:57.707
Everything she said about
the two deaths has been confirmed.

859
01:18:57.949 --> 01:19:00.861
The FBI says Verheek was killed
in some hotel mugging.

860
01:19:01.149 --> 01:19:03.060
- That's what you told me.
- That's what they told me.

861
01:19:03.469 --> 01:19:06.302
And they said they knew of
no connection with the assassinations.

862
01:19:06.549 --> 01:19:09.347
- What else would they say?
- I'm interested in what they did say.

863
01:19:10.829 --> 01:19:12.820
Let's look at what I have confirmed.

864
01:19:13.469 --> 01:19:17.064
Callahan was killed.
He was a professor. They had an affair.

865
01:19:17.309 --> 01:19:20.221
Give it to the Times-Picayune.
Maybe they want some gossip.

866
01:19:20.469 --> 01:19:23.029
I also found that Callahan clerked
for Rosenberg 20 years ago.

867
01:19:23.269 --> 01:19:25.305
Life is filled with odd coincidence.

868
01:19:25.629 --> 01:19:27.108
Not a coincidence if the brief...

869
01:19:27.349 --> 01:19:29.544
You have no confirmation
there is a brief.

870
01:19:29.789 --> 01:19:31.984
I confirmed Verheek and Callahan
were friends.

871
01:19:32.269 --> 01:19:36.308
They met here a few weeks ago,
when he must have given him the brief.

872
01:19:36.549 --> 01:19:38.938
- Supposition again.
- I've confirmed the pelican lawsuit.

873
01:19:39.189 --> 01:19:42.977
On which she has based her suppositions.
It's all just suppositions.

874
01:19:43.989 --> 01:19:45.707
You know what Mattiece could do?

875
01:19:45.949 --> 01:19:47.780
I know what he has done already.

876
01:19:48.029 --> 01:19:49.587
He has a bizarre history.

877
01:19:49.829 --> 01:19:52.821
So do I, according to my ex-wife. It
doesn't mean that I killed the Justices.

878
01:19:53.069 --> 01:19:55.025
But it means it's worth exploring.

879
01:19:56.869 --> 01:20:01.579
Go down to that crappy cabin of yours
on the weekend, hole up, retrench.

880
01:20:01.829 --> 01:20:06.345
Prove you have a way to revitalize
this story, and I might keep you on it.

881
01:20:08.389 --> 01:20:11.267
But if I were you, I'd check
where to eat in Little Rock.

882
01:20:17.189 --> 01:20:20.864
<i>This is the story of a mystery</i>
<i>that may never be solved.</i>

883
01:20:21.229 --> 01:20:24.699
<i>The story of a brilliant young lawyer</i>
<i>who loved this land...</i>

884
01:20:24.949 --> 01:20:28.339
<i>... and wanted to fight to preserve it</i>
<i>from the inroads of man...</i>

885
01:20:28.629 --> 01:20:30.062
<i>... until his abrupt death...</i>

886
01:20:30.309 --> 01:20:32.186
<i>... a few months ago.</i>

887
01:20:33.509 --> 01:20:37.548
<i>His body was found in a lonely cottage,</i>
<i>near the Louisiana bayou he loved.</i>

888
01:20:37.989 --> 01:20:39.945
<i>There was a bullet in his head...</i>

889
01:20:40.189 --> 01:20:41.827
<i>... and a gun beside him.</i>

890
01:20:42.589 --> 01:20:45.467
<i>The coroner and police</i>
<i>have deemed it a suicide.</i>

891
01:20:46.189 --> 01:20:49.625
<i>But he died sitting at a computer,</i>
<i>surrounded by his notes...</i>

892
01:20:49.869 --> 01:20:52.508
<i>... for what he called</i>
<i>the case he was born to win.</i>

893
01:20:54.229 --> 01:20:56.220
<i>His friends and family ask...</i>

894
01:20:56.469 --> 01:20:59.188
<i>... would anyone commit suicide</i>
<i>in such a manner...</i>

895
01:20:59.429 --> 01:21:00.748
<i>... at such a time?</i>

896
01:21:02.029 --> 01:21:05.066
<i>Tonight, Frontline explores</i>
<i>a young idealist's death.</i>

897
01:21:52.869 --> 01:21:54.348
Who's there?

898
01:21:55.789 --> 01:21:57.541
It's Darby!

899
01:22:17.469 --> 01:22:18.822
I got your message.

900
01:22:20.589 --> 01:22:24.502
If they bugged your phone,
they'd think I'd left the country.

901
01:22:31.069 --> 01:22:33.219
Did you find that lawyer in DC?

902
01:22:33.949 --> 01:22:34.984
Not yet.

903
01:22:35.789 --> 01:22:38.098
My editor wants to take me
off the story.

904
01:22:39.909 --> 01:22:41.627
I could help you find him.

905
01:22:44.869 --> 01:22:45.938
How'd you find me?

906
01:22:47.789 --> 01:22:49.825
I called your editor.

907
01:22:51.469 --> 01:22:52.902
He told you?

908
01:22:56.029 --> 01:23:00.580
I told him I was your sister Mary
from out of town and couldn't find you.

909
01:23:03.509 --> 01:23:05.306
How'd you know I had a sister Mary?

910
01:23:06.909 --> 01:23:09.343
You're not the only one doing research.

911
01:23:35.349 --> 01:23:37.465
It was a beautiful service.

912
01:23:51.069 --> 01:23:54.027
I'll have an announcement
after the weekend.

913
01:24:03.549 --> 01:24:07.019
It was the right thing to do,
no matter where the body was found.

914
01:24:14.869 --> 01:24:16.985
You can't announce
the nominations next week.

915
01:24:17.229 --> 01:24:19.265
You said they'd be vetted this weekend.

916
01:24:19.509 --> 01:24:21.181
There must be a change in plans.

917
01:24:21.429 --> 01:24:22.908
I don't understand.

918
01:24:23.749 --> 01:24:25.068
The Pelican Brief.

919
01:24:27.109 --> 01:24:28.986
What about the Pelican Brief?

920
01:24:29.229 --> 01:24:31.789
I thought that was ancient history.

921
01:24:32.029 --> 01:24:34.907
We believe that Grantham's
gotten ahold of it.

922
01:24:35.629 --> 01:24:38.462
Mattiece will sue them
if they try to publish that.

923
01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:39.903
Not if it's true.

924
01:24:45.989 --> 01:24:47.741
You think it's true?

925
01:24:48.509 --> 01:24:50.625
I know what Grantham will write:

926
01:24:51.109 --> 01:24:53.065
"A man who gave
the President millions...

927
01:24:53.309 --> 01:24:56.107
...had two Supreme Court Justices killed
so the President...

928
01:24:56.349 --> 01:24:58.863
...could appoint
more reasonable judges...

929
01:24:59.109 --> 01:25:01.179
...so his oil could be harvested."

930
01:25:01.789 --> 01:25:06.067
If Voyles says you told him to back off
the case, we face an obstruction charge.

931
01:25:06.349 --> 01:25:07.748
Oh, Jesus!

932
01:25:10.949 --> 01:25:12.860
There's a way to handle this.

933
01:25:13.149 --> 01:25:14.343
Handle it how?

934
01:25:15.749 --> 01:25:18.104
We appoint two nature-lovers
to the court.

935
01:25:18.989 --> 01:25:22.823
Good environmentalists
who'd kill Mattiece and his oil field.

936
01:25:23.269 --> 01:25:26.739
Meet with Voyles, in the presence
of the Attorney General...

937
01:25:26.989 --> 01:25:29.549
...and demand an investigation
into Mattiece.

938
01:25:29.789 --> 01:25:32.383
I'll leak the brief
to every reporter in town.

939
01:25:32.669 --> 01:25:34.899
Then we ride out the storm.

940
01:25:35.469 --> 01:25:39.985
But there has to be some way to keep
this information from coming out.

941
01:25:40.229 --> 01:25:41.503
I'm working on it.

942
01:25:43.429 --> 01:25:44.908
What? How?

943
01:25:45.149 --> 01:25:46.298
Mr. President...

944
01:25:46.829 --> 01:25:48.103
...you don't want to know.

945
01:25:58.829 --> 01:26:00.547
What's this all about?

946
01:26:00.789 --> 01:26:02.586
A trip to Mt. Vernon will do you good.

947
01:26:02.829 --> 01:26:04.148
Are you losing it?

948
01:26:04.989 --> 01:26:07.787
First I order you to go to Little Rock,
you refuse to go.

949
01:26:08.029 --> 01:26:10.862
You refuse to tell me why,
then you order me...

950
01:26:11.109 --> 01:26:12.986
...your boss, I might add...

951
01:26:13.229 --> 01:26:16.221
...to drop everything
and meet you at George's place.

952
01:26:16.789 --> 01:26:19.064
I thought of making you unemployed...

953
01:26:19.389 --> 01:26:21.300
...but you'd sue me for discrimination.

954
01:26:21.549 --> 01:26:22.664
She's here.

955
01:26:23.349 --> 01:26:25.101
- The bird girl?
- She's here.

956
01:26:26.509 --> 01:26:28.306
- You could've told me.
- Not wise.

957
01:26:28.549 --> 01:26:31.905
By the way, refusing to tell me
where you could be reached...

958
01:26:32.149 --> 01:26:33.821
...didn't leave a good impression.

959
01:26:34.069 --> 01:26:36.708
It's too risky to go to my apartment
or to the job.

960
01:26:36.949 --> 01:26:39.258
- Where have you been?
- In a little hotel.

961
01:26:39.549 --> 01:26:42.109
This is a hell of a time
to punch notches in your belt.

962
01:26:42.429 --> 01:26:45.501
We're not in the same hotel.
She's helping me find Garcia.

963
01:26:45.749 --> 01:26:48.183
It sounds like she's in control.

964
01:26:48.429 --> 01:26:49.657
It's the only way she'd play.

965
01:26:50.229 --> 01:26:52.106
So what if you can't find Garcia?

966
01:26:52.349 --> 01:26:54.067
- We go to plan B.
- What's that?

967
01:26:54.309 --> 01:26:57.267
- We attack the lawyers directly.
- What if it's another firm?

968
01:26:57.509 --> 01:26:58.783
- We go to plan C.
- What's that?

969
01:26:59.029 --> 01:27:01.145
- We didn't go that far.
- What if you do?

970
01:27:01.629 --> 01:27:03.904
I must be able to get in touch with you.

971
01:27:05.469 --> 01:27:09.860
I'm at the Marbury Hotel, room 833.
Don't use my name.

972
01:27:10.189 --> 01:27:11.383
Write it down.

973
01:27:13.469 --> 01:27:15.380
You mind getting off at the next exit?

974
01:27:15.749 --> 01:27:16.659
Why?

975
01:27:17.229 --> 01:27:19.902
A tan car's been two cars behind us...

976
01:27:20.229 --> 01:27:22.663
...since we got on the parkway.

977
01:27:41.149 --> 01:27:42.946
I thought it was following us.

978
01:27:43.189 --> 01:27:44.099
Right.

979
01:28:25.389 --> 01:28:27.300
Georgetown Law School, please.

980
01:28:33.829 --> 01:28:34.784
Hurry.

981
01:29:38.789 --> 01:29:40.541
Meet me by the stacks.

982
01:29:53.989 --> 01:29:55.741
Someone was in my room.

983
01:29:57.749 --> 01:29:59.580
Did you tell anyone where you were?

984
01:29:59.829 --> 01:30:02.138
Smith Keen, but he'd never repeat it.

985
01:30:02.629 --> 01:30:04.301
Did you tell him by phone?

986
01:30:04.549 --> 01:30:05.618
We were...

987
01:30:07.269 --> 01:30:08.622
We were in his car.

988
01:30:09.189 --> 01:30:10.907
<i>- Georgetown Law Center.</i>
- Placement Office, please.

989
01:30:11.149 --> 01:30:12.980
<i>- One moment, please.</i>
- Placement Office.

990
01:30:13.229 --> 01:30:16.380
This is Susan Johnson.
I'm a partner with White & Blazevich.

991
01:30:16.629 --> 01:30:20.224
We're trying to reconstruct
some payroll records.

992
01:30:20.469 --> 01:30:24.508
May I have the names of your students
that clerked here last summer?

993
01:30:25.269 --> 01:30:28.147
I'm from White & Blazevich.
You have something for me?

994
01:30:30.589 --> 01:30:32.784
Would you sign this, please?

995
01:30:39.149 --> 01:30:41.617
- Thank you, Mr. Stevens.
- You're welcome.

996
01:30:42.109 --> 01:30:44.225
I'll call these five and see who's home.

997
01:30:44.549 --> 01:30:48.428
I'll take the two with no phone number
and get their class schedules.

998
01:30:54.429 --> 01:30:55.464
See you later.

999
01:31:00.869 --> 01:31:04.179
I'm from the Washington Herald.
I'm looking for...

1000
01:31:04.429 --> 01:31:06.784
...Robert Akers and Laura Kaas.
- Is there a problem?

1001
01:31:07.029 --> 01:31:08.940
Just a few questions I want to ask.

1002
01:31:09.869 --> 01:31:11.382
Are they in class this morning?

1003
01:31:13.389 --> 01:31:15.141
One moment, please.

1004
01:31:22.069 --> 01:31:23.058
Excuse me.

1005
01:31:23.869 --> 01:31:24.824
Do you have ID?

1006
01:31:27.029 --> 01:31:30.101
Could I speak to Dennis Maylor, please?

1007
01:31:31.069 --> 01:31:32.468
<i>I'm Keith Maylor.</i>

1008
01:31:33.029 --> 01:31:35.145
I'm sorry to bother you.

1009
01:31:40.269 --> 01:31:43.978
Akers has Criminal Procedure,
Kaas has Administrative Law.

1010
01:31:44.229 --> 01:31:47.904
I'll try to find them. Maylor,
Reinhart and Wilson were all at home.

1011
01:31:48.149 --> 01:31:49.628
I can go to Maylor's.

1012
01:31:52.109 --> 01:31:53.098
Excuse me.

1013
01:31:53.389 --> 01:31:57.746
- Do you know Laura Kaas?
- She's the girl with the red backpack.

1014
01:32:03.189 --> 01:32:06.864
Do you recognize this man?
He's a lawyer at White & Blazevich.

1015
01:32:07.949 --> 01:32:09.462
We're down to Akers and Linney.

1016
01:32:09.829 --> 01:32:11.057
Linney's phone was disconnected.

1017
01:32:11.789 --> 01:32:13.302
I'll get his class schedule.

1018
01:32:13.669 --> 01:32:15.261
I'll keep looking for Akers.

1019
01:32:15.909 --> 01:32:17.058
It's me again.

1020
01:32:17.829 --> 01:32:20.423
I need the class schedule
for Edward Linney.

1021
01:32:20.669 --> 01:32:22.227
I'm sorry, Mr. Grantham.

1022
01:32:22.589 --> 01:32:26.946
A student you talked to called
White & Blazevich, who called the Dean.

1023
01:32:27.549 --> 01:32:30.109
No more class schedules for reporters.

1024
01:32:41.029 --> 01:32:42.144
Mr. Grantham.

1025
01:32:43.749 --> 01:32:44.977
I know Edward.

1026
01:32:45.749 --> 01:32:49.788
He's dropped out of school for a while.
Personal problems.

1027
01:32:50.349 --> 01:32:51.464
Where is he?

1028
01:32:51.749 --> 01:32:54.343
His parents put him
in a private hospital.

1029
01:32:55.029 --> 01:32:56.985
He's being detoxified.

1030
01:32:58.989 --> 01:33:01.184
Look, he's a good guy.

1031
01:33:02.789 --> 01:33:04.541
Parklane Hospital.

1032
01:33:28.349 --> 01:33:29.464
Good afternoon.

1033
01:33:31.109 --> 01:33:32.508
May I see Edward Linney?

1034
01:33:33.269 --> 01:33:35.339
- What room is he in?
- What's your name?

1035
01:33:35.669 --> 01:33:38.422
Gray Grantham, Washington Herald.

1036
01:33:38.949 --> 01:33:41.099
The law school said I could see him.

1037
01:33:41.949 --> 01:33:42.904
I'm sorry they did.

1038
01:33:44.509 --> 01:33:47.307
We run this hospital
and they run their law school.

1039
01:33:48.829 --> 01:33:50.182
May I see your administrator?

1040
01:33:51.749 --> 01:33:53.421
I'll see if I can find him.

1041
01:34:19.509 --> 01:34:21.067
Great architecture.

1042
01:34:21.669 --> 01:34:23.500
I'm sorry, Mr. Grantham.

1043
01:34:23.749 --> 01:34:26.343
<i>Visitation is only allowed</i>
<i>on the weekend...</i>

1044
01:34:26.789 --> 01:34:28.268
<i>... and then only family.</i>

1045
01:34:28.989 --> 01:34:30.980
<i>When will he be discharged?</i>

1046
01:34:31.229 --> 01:34:33.618
<i>I'm afraid that's confidential.</i>

1047
01:34:35.069 --> 01:34:37.458
Perhaps when his insurance expires?

1048
01:34:39.629 --> 01:34:41.426
Do you recognize that man?

1049
01:34:43.229 --> 01:34:44.218
What's his name?

1050
01:34:45.669 --> 01:34:47.899
That's the point, I don't know.

1051
01:34:49.469 --> 01:34:51.061
What is his name?

1052
01:34:54.789 --> 01:34:58.099
He works in the oil and gas section
on the 9th floor.

1053
01:35:02.949 --> 01:35:03.586
Morgan.

1054
01:35:07.189 --> 01:35:08.144
Morgan.

1055
01:35:08.989 --> 01:35:11.105
His first name's something like...

1056
01:35:11.349 --> 01:35:13.067
...Charles, but that's not it.

1057
01:35:14.109 --> 01:35:16.464
I can't tell you how grateful I am.

1058
01:35:19.149 --> 01:35:21.060
When you opened the door...

1059
01:35:22.509 --> 01:35:24.147
...I thought I was hallucinating.

1060
01:35:26.069 --> 01:35:27.422
I'm sorry.

1061
01:35:28.869 --> 01:35:31.258
I'll take a hallucination like that...

1062
01:35:31.829 --> 01:35:33.148
...anytime.

1063
01:35:35.909 --> 01:35:37.137
Take care of yourself.

1064
01:35:41.869 --> 01:35:43.188
Excuse me, miss.

1065
01:35:43.629 --> 01:35:44.584
What're you doing?

1066
01:35:45.629 --> 01:35:46.823
Visiting my brother.

1067
01:35:47.069 --> 01:35:48.388
Who is your brother?

1068
01:35:48.629 --> 01:35:49.618
Edward Linney.

1069
01:35:51.429 --> 01:35:52.657
This your sister?

1070
01:36:00.429 --> 01:36:01.828
Leave her alone.

1071
01:36:03.229 --> 01:36:05.140
Mom will come on the weekend.

1072
01:36:05.629 --> 01:36:06.584
Sis?

1073
01:36:07.549 --> 01:36:08.823
Come back soon.

1074
01:36:09.149 --> 01:36:10.423
I'll try.

1075
01:36:11.349 --> 01:36:15.228
I know you'd agree with me about
the horrendous cost of health care.

1076
01:36:15.469 --> 01:36:16.902
Of course, of course.

1077
01:36:17.189 --> 01:36:21.023
We pride ourselves on our
enlightened policy regarding payment.

1078
01:36:21.269 --> 01:36:23.100
Thank you very much for your time.

1079
01:36:26.229 --> 01:36:29.938
We'll be happy to have you back
on any of our normal visiting days.

1080
01:36:34.429 --> 01:36:36.818
Curtis Morgan, oil and gas.

1081
01:36:47.469 --> 01:36:48.982
White & Blazevich, please.

1082
01:36:49.229 --> 01:36:51.379
Second floor.
Use the escalator.

1083
01:37:11.989 --> 01:37:12.865
May I help you?

1084
01:37:13.109 --> 01:37:15.543
Dorothy Blythe, to see Curtis Morgan.

1085
01:37:17.629 --> 01:37:19.984
Have a seat. I'll be right with you.

1086
01:37:53.189 --> 01:37:56.340
- You have a meeting with Mr. Morgan?
- At 5.

1087
01:37:56.869 --> 01:37:59.178
- When was your appointment?
- 2 weeks ago.

1088
01:37:59.429 --> 01:38:00.862
May I ask why?

1089
01:38:01.269 --> 01:38:03.737
Obviously, I need an oil and gas lawyer.

1090
01:38:05.029 --> 01:38:06.667
Curtis Morgan is dead.

1091
01:38:08.989 --> 01:38:10.183
Why didn't anyone call me?

1092
01:38:10.909 --> 01:38:13.264
We have no record of your appointment.

1093
01:38:14.349 --> 01:38:15.338
What happened?

1094
01:38:15.989 --> 01:38:18.139
He was mugged a week ago.

1095
01:38:18.389 --> 01:38:20.459
Shot by street punks, we believe.

1096
01:38:20.749 --> 01:38:22.421
Do you have some identification?

1097
01:38:23.629 --> 01:38:24.823
He's Security.

1098
01:38:25.069 --> 01:38:26.582
Security for what?

1099
01:38:27.549 --> 01:38:30.109
Come with us,
you should see someone else.

1100
01:38:30.349 --> 01:38:34.581
After this treatment, I have no interest
in talking to anyone in this firm.

1101
01:38:50.989 --> 01:38:52.900
They killed him!

1102
01:39:00.669 --> 01:39:02.022
I can't breathe!

1103
01:39:17.829 --> 01:39:20.263
It's all right.
Just let it go.

1104
01:39:20.509 --> 01:39:21.544
Let it go.

1105
01:39:26.429 --> 01:39:27.657
It's all right.

1106
01:39:35.149 --> 01:39:38.221
<i>We ran the story about a week ago.</i>
<i>It's just another mugging.</i>

1107
01:39:38.509 --> 01:39:40.818
<i>Didn't make the Metro front page.</i>

1108
01:39:41.109 --> 01:39:42.383
<i>Curtis Morgan...</i>

1109
01:39:42.629 --> 01:39:45.018
<i>... 225 Willow Road, Bethesda.</i>

1110
01:39:45.629 --> 01:39:47.859
225 Willow Road...

1111
01:39:48.429 --> 01:39:49.828
...Bethesda.

1112
01:39:50.349 --> 01:39:51.668
That's what I wanted.

1113
01:39:51.989 --> 01:39:55.504
<i>Report in before noon tomorrow.</i>
<i>We're nervous over here.</i>

1114
01:39:56.349 --> 01:39:57.464
<i>You know...</i>

1115
01:39:57.829 --> 01:39:59.785
<i>... good help is hard to find.</i>

1116
01:40:06.549 --> 01:40:08.062
I'm going with you.

1117
01:40:12.349 --> 01:40:13.668
Look at me.

1118
01:40:22.149 --> 01:40:23.901
I want you to leave.

1119
01:40:26.829 --> 01:40:29.502
And if you need confirmation
for your story?

1120
01:40:30.349 --> 01:40:31.623
I'm on my own.

1121
01:40:35.269 --> 01:40:37.180
What's changed your mind?

1122
01:40:40.909 --> 01:40:42.945
I want you to reach 25.

1123
01:40:49.309 --> 01:40:50.742
I'm coming.

1124
01:41:18.029 --> 01:41:19.348
Good evening.

1125
01:41:19.589 --> 01:41:22.023
I'm Grantham of the Herald.
This is my assistant.

1126
01:41:22.269 --> 01:41:26.308
- Could we see Mrs. Morgan?
- I'm her father. She won't talk.

1127
01:41:26.989 --> 01:41:30.265
I respect her privacy.
I know she's been through an ordeal.

1128
01:41:31.149 --> 01:41:33.868
When did you people
ever respect anyone's privacy?

1129
01:41:35.029 --> 01:41:39.102
I feel that way about most reporters.
But her husband called me...

1130
01:41:39.869 --> 01:41:41.746
...3 times before he died.

1131
01:41:42.149 --> 01:41:44.458
I believe his death
wasn't accidental.

1132
01:41:46.189 --> 01:41:48.828
She doesn't want to talk.
Get the hell out of here.

1133
01:41:51.949 --> 01:41:53.462
You change your mind...

1134
01:41:54.269 --> 01:41:55.987
...I'll be at this number.

1135
01:43:05.389 --> 01:43:07.220
<i>This is Mrs. Morgan.</i>

1136
01:43:08.749 --> 01:43:11.104
<i>Do you still want to see me?</i>

1137
01:43:13.869 --> 01:43:16.019
Did you know your husband called me?

1138
01:43:19.829 --> 01:43:22.502
How would he know anything
about those dead judges?

1139
01:43:23.269 --> 01:43:25.305
I have no idea.

1140
01:43:26.349 --> 01:43:27.987
Did he keep any...

1141
01:43:28.229 --> 01:43:30.220
...unusual documents...

1142
01:43:30.469 --> 01:43:31.538
...or papers?

1143
01:43:33.029 --> 01:43:36.226
We have a lock box at the bank
for deed and wills.

1144
01:43:37.669 --> 01:43:41.423
I looked at it last Thursday.
There was nothing unusual in it.

1145
01:43:43.309 --> 01:43:45.027
On Saturday morning...

1146
01:43:45.269 --> 01:43:47.260
...I was going through his...

1147
01:43:49.069 --> 01:43:51.060
...desk in the bedroom.

1148
01:43:52.189 --> 01:43:54.259
I found something a bit unusual.

1149
01:43:56.389 --> 01:43:57.424
A key.

1150
01:43:59.629 --> 01:44:00.664
A key to what?

1151
01:44:02.509 --> 01:44:04.147
Another lock box.

1152
01:44:05.989 --> 01:44:07.058
Which bank?

1153
01:44:08.589 --> 01:44:10.261
Riggs Bank.

1154
01:44:13.669 --> 01:44:15.307
We've never banked there.

1155
01:44:16.029 --> 01:44:18.259
And you knew nothing
about this other...

1156
01:44:19.069 --> 01:44:19.945
...box?

1157
01:44:20.189 --> 01:44:21.861
Not until Saturday morning.

1158
01:44:22.429 --> 01:44:24.147
I figured...

1159
01:44:24.869 --> 01:44:27.178
...I'll run by when I felt up to it.

1160
01:44:28.429 --> 01:44:30.465
Maybe you should check it, Mrs. Morgan.

1161
01:44:32.909 --> 01:44:34.900
Could be a clue to who killed him.

1162
01:44:36.229 --> 01:44:38.743
Are you saying Curtis was killed...

1163
01:44:38.989 --> 01:44:41.901
...because he knew something
about the assassinations?

1164
01:44:42.189 --> 01:44:44.259
That's exactly what I'm saying.

1165
01:44:45.229 --> 01:44:49.780
<i>Do you think there may be papers</i>
<i>in the safe-deposit box...</i>

1166
01:44:50.029 --> 01:44:53.465
<i>... that may reveal what Curtis knew</i>
<i>about the assassinations?</i>

1167
01:44:53.989 --> 01:44:55.820
<i>There could be.</i>

1168
01:44:58.389 --> 01:45:00.584
My child's lost one parent.

1169
01:45:04.549 --> 01:45:06.426
I can't let her lose another.

1170
01:45:08.909 --> 01:45:10.342
I'll check it for you.

1171
01:45:11.069 --> 01:45:13.060
No one has to know you have the key.

1172
01:45:17.469 --> 01:45:19.778
They will only give it to his wife.

1173
01:45:20.029 --> 01:45:22.384
My partner's a woman.
She's trustworthy.

1174
01:45:24.109 --> 01:45:25.588
I would have one condition.

1175
01:45:25.829 --> 01:45:30.425
If you find something that disparages
my husband in any way, you can't use it.

1176
01:45:31.029 --> 01:45:33.304
You have my word, Mrs. Morgan.

1177
01:47:04.429 --> 01:47:06.101
Where are the safe-deposit boxes?

1178
01:47:06.349 --> 01:47:07.543
Down those steps.

1179
01:48:25.669 --> 01:48:27.625
I need access to a box, please.

1180
01:48:27.869 --> 01:48:29.825
- The number, please?
- 616.

1181
01:48:32.789 --> 01:48:35.349
This box was rented 2 weeks ago.

1182
01:48:36.869 --> 01:48:39.667
- I assume you're Mrs. Morgan?
- Sara Ann Morgan.

1183
01:48:39.989 --> 01:48:42.583
- The address?
- 225 Willow Road, Bethesda.

1184
01:48:43.909 --> 01:48:47.345
- Phone number?
- 301-555-7128.

1185
01:48:48.109 --> 01:48:49.508
Who rented this box?

1186
01:48:49.749 --> 01:48:52.422
- My husband, Curtis D. Morgan.
- And his social security number?

1187
01:48:57.869 --> 01:49:00.178
510-96-8686.

1188
01:49:01.789 --> 01:49:03.461
Will you sign here, please?

1189
01:49:04.149 --> 01:49:05.138
May I help you?

1190
01:49:05.389 --> 01:49:07.186
I'd like to rent a box.

1191
01:49:07.429 --> 01:49:10.307
Will you have a seat?
I'll be with you in a minute.

1192
01:49:12.149 --> 01:49:13.104
Your key?

1193
01:49:13.349 --> 01:49:14.623
Yes, I do.

1194
01:49:16.749 --> 01:49:17.977
Follow me.

1195
01:50:54.989 --> 01:50:56.866
It's a four-page affidavit...

1196
01:50:57.149 --> 01:50:59.583
...signed under oath.

1197
01:50:59.829 --> 01:51:02.821
It's dated the day before
the last time he called me.

1198
01:51:05.549 --> 01:51:10.145
He worked at White & Blazevich
in the oil and gas section for 5 years.

1199
01:51:11.389 --> 01:51:12.504
Listen to this!

1200
01:51:12.749 --> 01:51:14.023
During that time...

1201
01:51:14.269 --> 01:51:18.660
...he worked for a client who
was engaged in a lawsuit in Louisiana.

1202
01:51:18.909 --> 01:51:21.867
The client was a man
named Victor Mattiece...

1203
01:51:22.149 --> 01:51:23.582
...who he's never met.

1204
01:51:23.949 --> 01:51:27.703
Lots about the lawsuit,
how desperate Mattiece was to win it.

1205
01:51:27.949 --> 01:51:29.541
Just as if you wrote it.

1206
01:51:31.309 --> 01:51:34.142
A partner named Sims Wakefield...

1207
01:51:34.389 --> 01:51:38.428
...supervised the case for W & B.
Morgan worked on a peripherated case.

1208
01:51:38.829 --> 01:51:42.219
He took files and documents
that Wakefield left for him...

1209
01:51:42.469 --> 01:51:44.027
...not related to the case.

1210
01:51:44.269 --> 01:51:48.706
When he got back to his own office, he
found a memo on the bottom of the stack.

1211
01:51:48.949 --> 01:51:51.941
He'd inadvertently taken it
from Wakefield's desk.

1212
01:51:52.189 --> 01:51:54.987
A copy of the memo
is attached to the affidavit.

1213
01:51:55.349 --> 01:51:59.581
He copied the memo and left the memo
under the files on his desk.

1214
01:51:59.829 --> 01:52:02.104
Next stop, Washington Herald!

1215
01:52:04.549 --> 01:52:06.301
No! Stop!
Get out of the car!

1216
01:55:12.909 --> 01:55:16.618
There was a car explosion
in a garage near the Riggs Bank.

1217
01:55:16.869 --> 01:55:19.781
The police traced the car
to a leasing agency.

1218
01:55:20.549 --> 01:55:23.188
It was rented yesterday by Grantham.

1219
01:55:25.309 --> 01:55:27.345
Have you heard from Grantham?

1220
01:55:28.349 --> 01:55:30.021
Not since yesterday.

1221
01:55:31.949 --> 01:55:33.780
I should've taken him off that story.

1222
01:55:34.869 --> 01:55:35.745
What story?

1223
01:55:38.669 --> 01:55:40.580
See what you can find.

1224
01:56:01.029 --> 01:56:02.303
Smith Keen...

1225
01:56:02.909 --> 01:56:04.467
...meet Darby Shaw.

1226
01:56:08.429 --> 01:56:10.226
What the hell is going on?

1227
01:56:19.949 --> 01:56:22.782
<i>Sweetheart, I'm down here</i>
<i>in the basement.</i>

1228
01:56:24.349 --> 01:56:26.419
<i>It's about two in the morning.</i>

1229
01:56:28.909 --> 01:56:30.103
<i>This is...</i>

1230
01:56:30.949 --> 01:56:31.984
<i>... an affidavit...</i>

1231
01:56:34.549 --> 01:56:37.063
<i>... concerning a memo</i>
<i>I found on my desk.</i>

1232
01:56:38.469 --> 01:56:42.144
<i>I'm going to trust you</i>
<i>to do with it what you will.</i>

1233
01:56:43.189 --> 01:56:46.386
<i>The memo 's from Velmano,</i>
<i>he's a senior partner.</i>

1234
01:56:49.149 --> 01:56:52.107
<i>It was dated September 28th...</i>

1235
01:56:53.429 --> 01:56:56.068
<i>... addressed to Wakefield and it read:</i>

1236
01:56:56.309 --> 01:56:58.777
<i>"Sims, advise client</i>
<i>research is complete.</i>

1237
01:56:59.509 --> 01:57:03.138
<i>The bench will sit much softer</i>
<i>if the old man is retired.</i>

1238
01:57:03.989 --> 01:57:07.379
<i>The second retirement is a bit unusual.</i>
<i>Jensen, of all people.</i>

1239
01:57:08.309 --> 01:57:11.619
<i>Advise further that the pelican</i>
<i>should arrive here in 4 years...</i>

1240
01:57:11.869 --> 01:57:13.860
<i>... assuming other factors."</i>

1241
01:57:14.789 --> 01:57:16.063
<i>There's no signature.</i>

1242
01:57:17.149 --> 01:57:20.027
<i>Then Justices Rosenberg and Jensen</i>
<i>were killed.</i>

1243
01:57:22.789 --> 01:57:26.145
<i>I firmly believe that this is</i>
<i>the work of Mattiece and his associates.</i>

1244
01:57:26.469 --> 01:57:29.142
<i>Memo doesn't mention Mattiece,</i>
<i>but it refers to a client.</i>

1245
01:57:29.389 --> 01:57:31.459
<i>Wakefield had no other clients.</i>

1246
01:57:31.869 --> 01:57:34.258
<i>And no client had as much to gain</i>
<i>from the new court.</i>

1247
01:57:36.629 --> 01:57:40.861
<i>I thought that I was protecting us</i>
<i>by not revealing what I found.</i>

1248
01:57:41.869 --> 01:57:44.986
<i>You'll only see this if I'm gone,</i>
<i>so I will have failed.</i>

1249
01:57:47.189 --> 01:57:48.668
<i>I'm sorry, sweetheart.</i>

1250
01:57:53.349 --> 01:57:55.101
<i>I'll always be with you.</i>

1251
01:57:57.309 --> 01:57:58.458
<i>Always.</i>

1252
01:58:01.349 --> 01:58:04.978
This is Marty Velmano. What a pleasure!
What can I do for you?

1253
01:58:05.789 --> 01:58:08.428
<i>We're doing a story</i>
<i>about Victor Mattiece...</i>

1254
01:58:09.389 --> 01:58:13.348
<i>... and his involvement in the deaths</i>
<i>of Rosenberg and Jensen.</i>

1255
01:58:13.829 --> 01:58:18.266
Great! We'll sue you for the next 20
years. You'll be named as a defendant.

1256
01:58:18.509 --> 01:58:20.500
Oh, this will be great.

1257
01:58:20.789 --> 01:58:23.144
Victor Mattiece will own the Herald.

1258
01:58:23.389 --> 01:58:27.143
<i>Have you heard of the Pelican Brief?</i>
<i>We have a copy of it.</i>

1259
01:58:27.789 --> 01:58:31.543
<i>We also have a copy of a memo</i>
<i>sent by you to Sims Wakefield...</i>

1260
01:58:31.789 --> 01:58:36.146
<i>... in which you suggest your client's</i>
<i>position would be greatly improved...</i>

1261
01:58:36.389 --> 01:58:40.223
<i>... by the removal of Rosenberg</i>
<i>and Jensen from the court.</i>

1262
01:58:40.749 --> 01:58:42.979
I noticed you waited till five.

1263
01:58:43.229 --> 01:58:46.266
An hour earlier, we could've
run to court, stopped this.

1264
01:58:46.789 --> 01:58:48.666
<i>You deny you wrote the memo?</i>

1265
01:58:51.909 --> 01:58:53.820
It's a fabrication.

1266
01:58:54.589 --> 01:58:56.819
You have no lawsuit, Mr. Velmano.

1267
01:58:57.589 --> 01:58:58.863
You know it.

1268
01:58:59.229 --> 01:59:00.787
You son of a bitch!

1269
01:59:03.789 --> 01:59:05.188
Mr. Coal?

1270
01:59:05.509 --> 01:59:08.501
<i>- Have you read the Pelican Brief?</i>
- I have.

1271
01:59:08.829 --> 01:59:12.947
<i>We're running a story which verifies</i>
<i>the facts set forth in that brief.</i>

1272
01:59:13.189 --> 01:59:16.226
<i>We've confirmed Mattiece</i>
<i>contributed over $4 million...</i>

1273
01:59:16.509 --> 01:59:18.386
<i>... to the President's last campaign.</i>

1274
01:59:18.629 --> 01:59:20.859
4,200,000, all through legal channels.

1275
01:59:21.109 --> 01:59:22.019
That's right.

1276
01:59:22.269 --> 01:59:26.387
<i>We believe the White House tried</i>
<i>to obstruct the FBI investigation...</i>

1277
01:59:26.629 --> 01:59:29.189
<i>... and we wonder</i>
<i>if there are any comments.</i>

1278
01:59:29.429 --> 01:59:32.501
The White House denies
any direct or indirect involvement...

1279
01:59:32.829 --> 01:59:34.945
...in this investigation.

1280
01:59:35.669 --> 01:59:37.864
You've received some bad information.

1281
01:59:45.469 --> 01:59:47.539
Mr. Voyles, it's Grantham.

1282
01:59:48.869 --> 01:59:51.463
We're running a story
detailing a conspiracy...

1283
01:59:51.709 --> 01:59:53.904
...in the murders of
Rosenberg and Jensen.

1284
01:59:54.149 --> 01:59:58.062
We're naming Mattiece, an oil
speculator, and two of his lawyers.

1285
01:59:58.349 --> 02:00:02.103
We believe the FBI knew about Mattiece,
but didn't investigate...

1286
02:00:02.349 --> 02:00:05.739
...at the urging of the White House.
Any comments?

1287
02:01:14.949 --> 02:01:17.941
<i>I think we'll have great success</i>
<i>with these people.</i>

1288
02:01:18.189 --> 02:01:20.749
<i>They were really very pleased...</i>

1289
02:01:21.069 --> 02:01:23.299
<i>... and genuinely cooperative.</i>

1290
02:01:23.869 --> 02:01:25.097
<i>What's up?</i>

1291
02:02:07.389 --> 02:02:08.504
You know Gray Grantham.

1292
02:02:10.749 --> 02:02:12.546
And this is Darby Shaw.

1293
02:02:20.349 --> 02:02:23.386
So you're the little lady
who started this great brouhaha.

1294
02:02:24.869 --> 02:02:27.986
I think you have me confused
with the President's friend.

1295
02:02:29.149 --> 02:02:32.585
I have some comments,
for the record.

1296
02:02:41.189 --> 02:02:43.828
First, we got the Pelican Brief
two weeks ago...

1297
02:02:44.069 --> 02:02:46.822
...and submitted it to the White House
on the same day.

1298
02:02:47.069 --> 02:02:51.745
It was not considered high priority in
the investigation until Gavin Verheek...

1299
02:02:52.069 --> 02:02:54.981
...Special Counsel to the Director,
was found murdered.

1300
02:02:55.229 --> 02:02:58.221
Did the White House interfere
in the FBI investigation of Mattiece?

1301
02:02:59.669 --> 02:03:01.307
I'll discuss it...

1302
02:03:01.589 --> 02:03:02.783
...off the record.

1303
02:03:10.349 --> 02:03:14.865
Last Wednesday the President asked me
to ignore Victor Mattiece as a suspect.

1304
02:03:15.109 --> 02:03:16.588
In his words...

1305
02:03:17.189 --> 02:03:18.941
...he asked me to "back off."

1306
02:03:19.869 --> 02:03:21.268
I have a tape...

1307
02:03:21.789 --> 02:03:24.098
...which I will allow no one to hear...

1308
02:03:24.349 --> 02:03:27.182
...unless the President
first denies this.

1309
02:03:27.989 --> 02:03:29.422
So what do you do now?

1310
02:03:30.589 --> 02:03:34.423
There'll be a grand jury
by noon tomorrow. Quick indictments.

1311
02:03:35.749 --> 02:03:37.819
And we'll find Mattiece.

1312
02:03:40.109 --> 02:03:42.942
I'd like a few minutes alone
with Ms. Shaw.

1313
02:03:43.669 --> 02:03:45.341
- Lf she doesn't mind.
- It's her call.

1314
02:03:45.589 --> 02:03:47.386
I'd like Mr. Grantham to stay.

1315
02:04:07.349 --> 02:04:08.828
What's next for you?

1316
02:04:09.829 --> 02:04:12.218
Who killed the man disguised as Verheek?

1317
02:04:12.469 --> 02:04:15.108
Oh, you mean the assassin, Khamel.

1318
02:04:15.989 --> 02:04:18.867
Off the record, Khamel was killed
by a contract operative...

1319
02:04:19.109 --> 02:04:21.020
...hired independently by the CIA.

1320
02:04:22.029 --> 02:04:23.064
Rupert?

1321
02:04:23.309 --> 02:04:24.901
He probably has 20 names.

1322
02:04:25.149 --> 02:04:26.298
Why was he following her?

1323
02:04:27.509 --> 02:04:31.138
I think the brief initially
scared Giminski more than anyone.

1324
02:04:31.389 --> 02:04:32.822
And he probably...

1325
02:04:33.069 --> 02:04:33.979
...sent Rupert...

1326
02:04:34.269 --> 02:04:36.146
...to trail Darby...

1327
02:04:36.389 --> 02:04:39.506
...in part to watch,
and in part to protect.

1328
02:04:42.429 --> 02:04:43.782
We can help.

1329
02:04:44.989 --> 02:04:45.739
What do you want?

1330
02:04:48.069 --> 02:04:49.900
To leave the country, alone.

1331
02:04:52.909 --> 02:04:53.978
All right.

1332
02:04:54.549 --> 02:04:57.302
We'll get you out of here,
put you on my plane.

1333
02:04:57.629 --> 02:05:00.063
We'll fly you anywhere you want
and you can disappear.

1334
02:05:00.349 --> 02:05:02.863
But you must allow me to contact you...

1335
02:05:03.389 --> 02:05:04.617
...through Mr. Grantham...

1336
02:05:04.869 --> 02:05:08.225
...if, and only if,
it becomes urgently necessary.

1337
02:05:10.389 --> 02:05:11.583
That's fine.

1338
02:05:14.229 --> 02:05:17.346
I want no one on the plane but me,
Gray and the pilots.

1339
02:05:18.589 --> 02:05:21.023
After takeoff, I'll tell the pilot
where to go.

1340
02:05:21.669 --> 02:05:24.741
He has to file a flight plan
before he can leave.

1341
02:05:25.469 --> 02:05:27.744
You're the Director of the FBI.

1342
02:05:28.789 --> 02:05:30.108
Set it up.

1343
02:09:16.389 --> 02:09:18.300
<i>Our guest today is Gray Grantham...</i>

1344
02:09:18.589 --> 02:09:21.422
<i>... who has, as just about everyone</i>
<i>in America knows...</i>

1345
02:09:21.789 --> 02:09:26.419
<i>... revealed the plot behind the</i>
<i>assassinations of Rosenberg and Jensen.</i>

1346
02:09:26.749 --> 02:09:30.264
<i>The ripple effects of this story</i>
<i>just don't seem to stop.</i>

1347
02:09:30.509 --> 02:09:34.468
<i>As of this broadcast, Victor Mattiece,</i>
<i>one of the country's richest men...</i>

1348
02:09:34.709 --> 02:09:37.985
<i>... has been indicted, along with</i>
<i>4 aides and lawyers.</i>

1349
02:09:38.429 --> 02:09:42.342
<i>Fletcher Coal, the President's Chief</i>
<i>of Staff, has resigned.</i>

1350
02:09:42.589 --> 02:09:46.025
<i>And we're getting strong indications</i>
<i>that the President himself...</i>

1351
02:09:46.269 --> 02:09:47.622
<i>... will not run again.</i>

1352
02:09:48.269 --> 02:09:51.022
<i>That's what we know.</i>
<i>Let's get to what we don't.</i>

1353
02:09:52.349 --> 02:09:56.422
<i>We know the Pelican Brief was written</i>
<i>by a woman named Darby Shaw...</i>

1354
02:09:56.669 --> 02:09:58.819
<i>... but we don't know who that is.</i>

1355
02:09:59.069 --> 02:10:00.980
<i>Who is Darby Shaw?</i>

1356
02:10:03.309 --> 02:10:05.823
<i>That's a question for Darby Shaw.</i>

1357
02:10:06.069 --> 02:10:10.460
<i>That leads me to my next question.</i>
<i>Speaking for many of our colleagues...</i>

1358
02:10:10.789 --> 02:10:13.428
<i>... who are in a feeding frenzy to</i>
<i>interview her...</i>

1359
02:10:13.669 --> 02:10:15.387
<i>... where is Darby Shaw?</i>

1360
02:10:15.629 --> 02:10:19.781
<i>That's also a question for Darby Shaw.</i>
<i>But she's not available...</i>

1361
02:10:20.069 --> 02:10:22.537
<i>... to answer questions</i>
<i>until the feeding frenzy stops.</i>

1362
02:10:23.349 --> 02:10:26.147
<i>Does that mean you don't know</i>
<i>where she is?</i>

1363
02:10:27.229 --> 02:10:28.378
<i>I didn't say that.</i>

1364
02:10:28.669 --> 02:10:29.943
<i>Then you do know.</i>

1365
02:10:33.949 --> 02:10:36.099
<i>I take it this cryptic smile means...</i>

1366
02:10:36.349 --> 02:10:37.907
<i>... you're not answering.</i>

1367
02:10:40.149 --> 02:10:43.266
<i>In view of all this, you know that...</i>

1368
02:10:44.029 --> 02:10:45.382
<i>... there's speculation...</i>

1369
02:10:45.629 --> 02:10:49.099
<i>... that this woman is a figment</i>
<i>of your imagination.</i>

1370
02:10:49.349 --> 02:10:52.944
<i>That you created her</i>
<i>from a lot of different sources.</i>

1371
02:10:53.829 --> 02:10:56.980
<i>Just as there are people who believe</i>
<i>there was no Deep Throat...</i>

1372
02:10:57.229 --> 02:11:00.380
<i>... there are those who believe</i>
<i>there is no Darby Shaw.</i>

1373
02:11:00.629 --> 02:11:03.939
<i>In other words,</i>
<i>she's just too good to be true.</i>

1374
02:11:05.149 --> 02:11:06.628
<i>She almost is.</i>
