26
00:03:14.653 --> 00:03:16.947
Any signs got my name on them?

27
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:19.850
Quite a few.

28
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.950
What do they say?

29
00:03:22.995 --> 00:03:24.855
The usual.

30
00:03:24.955 --> 00:03:26.955
'Death to Rosenberg”...

31
00:03:26.957 --> 00:03:28.957
'Retire Rosenberg”...

32
00:03:29.668 --> 00:03:31.668
'Cut off the oxygen. ”

33
00:03:32.963 --> 00:03:34.965
That's my favourite.

34
00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:39.592
Of course, you, Mr Grantham...

35
00:03:39.803 --> 00:03:43.028
...did pretty good by me your last time out.

36
00:03:43.807 --> 00:03:46.228
'Rosenberg equals the government...

37
00:03:46.328 --> 00:03:47.377
...over business...

38
00:03:47.477 --> 00:03:49.609
...the individual over government,

39
00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.840
the environment over everything...

40
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.313
...and the Indians, oh,

41
00:03:53.413 --> 00:03:55.219
give them whatever they want.'

42
00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:56.555
With all due respect,

43
00:03:56.655 --> 00:03:58.931
that wasn't my line, that was a quote.

44
00:03:59.031 --> 00:04:00.781
From one of your unnamed

45
00:04:00.881 --> 00:04:03.056
Senior White House officials.

46
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.743
Senior White House bastard,

47
00:04:04.843 --> 00:04:06.063
you should have said.

48
00:04:06.163 --> 00:04:07.731
Got in there by...

49
00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:11.581
...stirring up these people, one against the other.

50
00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:15.464
Never fails to amaze me...

51
00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:19.384
...what a man will do to get an oval office.

52
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.391
Yes?

53
00:06:47.491 --> 00:06:50.494
Looking for Mr Sneller.
Mr Sneller?

54
00:06:50.702 --> 00:06:53.539
Yes, Mr Edwin F. Sneller.

55
00:07:25.195 --> 00:07:27.447
Hello.
Everything is in place.

56
00:07:27.948 --> 00:07:29.511
All the money must be there...

57
00:07:29.611 --> 00:07:30.851
...when I arrive in Zurich.

58
00:07:30.951 --> 00:07:33.912
It will be there if the job is finished.

59
00:07:34.872 --> 00:07:36.872
It will be finished.

60
00:07:42.546 --> 00:07:43.443
May I help you?

61
00:07:43.543 --> 00:07:45.449
I'd like to order room service.

62
00:07:45.549 --> 00:07:47.874
What would you like?
#NAME?

63
00:07:48.218 --> 00:07:49.937
...scrambled eggs, whole-wheat toast...

64
00:07:50.037 --> 00:07:51.121
...and orange juice, please.

65
00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:53.582
It'll be about 15 minutes.
Thank you.

66
00:07:53.682 --> 00:07:56.293
When we substitute threat for an argument...

67
00:07:56.393 --> 00:07:59.630
...violence for principle, we allow our passion...

68
00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:01.799
...to overcome our capacity for reason.

69
00:08:01.899 --> 00:08:05.819
Passion and self-interest are threats to liberty...

70
00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:07.625
...which brings us...

71
00:08:07.725 --> 00:08:09.848
...to Bowers against Hardwick.

72
00:08:09.948 --> 00:08:12.432
A police officer entered Mr Hardwick's...

73
00:08:12.532 --> 00:08:14.645
...apartment to serve him a warrant...

74
00:08:14.745 --> 00:08:17.981
...for an unpaid violation for drinking in public.

75
00:08:18.081 --> 00:08:20.631
They caught him with an open beer.

76
00:08:20.709 --> 00:08:23.237
When he entered Mr Hardwick's bedroom...

77
00:08:23.337 --> 00:08:25.887
...he found him in bed with a man.

78
00:08:26.256 --> 00:08:28.200
The officer arrested Hardwick...

79
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.501
...for violating Georgia's statute...

80
00:08:30.601 --> 00:08:31.829
...which outlaws sodomy.

81
00:08:31.929 --> 00:08:34.206
Even though Georgia dropped the case...

82
00:08:34.306 --> 00:08:35.813
...Hardwick challenged...

83
00:08:35.913 --> 00:08:38.168
...the constitutionality of the statute.

84
00:08:38.268 --> 00:08:40.268
Now, what was his claim?

85
00:08:40.938 --> 00:08:42.988
That it violates the right of privacy.

86
00:08:43.088 --> 00:08:45.088
Why?

87
00:08:45.359 --> 00:08:49.109
He's got the right to do as he pleases in his home.

88
00:08:49.738 --> 00:08:52.498
But what if he decided to sell drugs...

89
00:08:52.598 --> 00:08:55.598
...at his home or engage in child abuse?

90
00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:58.647
Those actions don't fit within the right of privacy.

91
00:08:58.747 --> 00:09:00.858
The court, beginning with Griswold...

92
00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.597
...has limited the right of privacy...

93
00:09:02.697 --> 00:09:04.069
...to actions which are intimate...

94
00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:06.199
...which are deeply personal,

95
00:09:06.252 --> 00:09:08.866
which allow us to control our lives...

96
00:09:08.966 --> 00:09:10.743
...to define who we are.

97
00:09:10.843 --> 00:09:12.646
But is that a constitutional claim?

98
00:09:12.746 --> 00:09:13.746
There's no...

99
00:09:13.846 --> 00:09:15.284
...right to define oneself...

100
00:09:15.384 --> 00:09:16.874
...written into the Constitution.

101
00:09:16.974 --> 00:09:18.876
It's not even in the Bill of Rights.

102
00:09:18.976 --> 00:09:20.748
If the State of Georgia can regulate

103
00:09:20.848 --> 00:09:21.962
Hardwick's sexuality...

104
00:09:22.062 --> 00:09:23.856
...engaged in private with consenting...

105
00:09:23.956 --> 00:09:25.382
...adults, Hardwick cannot be free.

106
00:09:25.482 --> 00:09:28.093
The Constitution ensures limited government.

107
00:09:28.193 --> 00:09:29.899
If there's no right of privacy...

108
00:09:29.999 --> 00:09:31.972
...and Georgia can enforce the statute...

109
00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:34.233
...we sacrifice the liberty the framers...

110
00:09:34.333 --> 00:09:35.809
...thought they'd guaranteed us.

111
00:09:35.909 --> 00:09:38.061
The Supreme Court disagreed with you.

112
00:09:38.161 --> 00:09:39.411
They found that the statute...

113
00:09:39.511 --> 00:09:41.064
...did not violate the right of privacy.

114
00:09:41.164 --> 00:09:42.441
Why?

115
00:09:42.541 --> 00:09:44.541
They're wrong.

116
00:10:07.691 --> 00:10:11.945
So all three of you girls find him irresistible. 
Why?

117
00:10:12.196 --> 00:10:13.931
Sexual attraction.

118
00:10:14.031 --> 00:10:16.408
You mean he's just got it?

119
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.268
Does he ever.

120
00:10:18.368 --> 00:10:19.978
What you're saying...

121
00:10:20.078 --> 00:10:21.868
...is that if you could clone...

122
00:10:21.968 --> 00:10:23.816
...three of him, you'd all be happy.

123
00:10:23.916 --> 00:10:26.835
Okay, tell us, what is your secret?

124
00:10:27.044 --> 00:10:29.219
I'm not sure I can say on TV.

125
00:10:29.463 --> 00:10:32.466
But what I can say is it's a big secret.

126
00:10:32.716 --> 00:10:34.718
A very big secret.

127
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.756
My goodness gracious.

128
00:10:37.782 --> 00:10:39.064
I can't believe my ears.

129
00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:40.958
Hope my mom's not watching.

130
00:10:41.058 --> 00:10:42.668
She hopes so too.

131
00:10:42.768 --> 00:10:44.336
Ma, I was just kidding.

132
00:10:44.436 --> 00:10:45.791
Ladies, have you changed...

133
00:10:45.891 --> 00:10:47.297
...your opinion about our stud?

134
00:10:47.397 --> 00:10:49.397
You still like him?

135
00:10:49.483 --> 00:10:51.902
I like big guys.

136
00:10:52.236 --> 00:10:54.686
I think your fan club has increased.

137
00:10:54.738 --> 00:10:56.738
Everything has increased.

138
00:13:42.406 --> 00:13:44.956
They found Rosenberg around 1 A.M.

139
00:13:45.033 --> 00:13:47.133
His nurse was also murdered.

140
00:13:47.244 --> 00:13:49.184
Jensen was found two hours later...

141
00:13:49.284 --> 00:13:50.314
...in some queer club.

142
00:13:50.414 --> 00:13:52.474
Voyles called me, wildly upset.

143
00:13:52.574 --> 00:13:55.164
It's hardly good for FBI's reputation.

144
00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:56.893
He and Giminski are on the way.

145
00:13:56.993 --> 00:13:57.446
Giminski?

146
00:13:57.546 --> 00:13:59.310
Yes. The CIA should be involved,

147
00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:00.324
at least for now.

148
00:14:00.424 --> 00:14:03.032
You must wait two hours to address...

149
00:14:03.132 --> 00:14:05.907
...the nation if we want an audience.

150
00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:08.361
A coat and tie may seem a bit rehearsed.

151
00:14:08.461 --> 00:14:09.583
How about a cardigan?

152
00:14:09.683 --> 00:14:12.235
You want me to talk to the nation in a...

153
00:14:12.335 --> 00:14:14.379
...time of crisis wearing a sweater?

154
00:14:14.479 --> 00:14:16.479
Mr President...

155
00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:18.822
...I've already told Justice...

156
00:14:18.922 --> 00:14:21.053
...to put together a list of nominees.

157
00:14:21.153 --> 00:14:24.378
Restructuring the court will be your legacy.

158
00:14:24.615 --> 00:14:26.615
Mr President.

159
00:14:27.159 --> 00:14:28.159
Mr Voyles,

160
00:14:28.259 --> 00:14:30.187
does the FBI have any suspects?

161
00:14:30.287 --> 00:14:31.688
It's too soon.

162
00:14:31.788 --> 00:14:34.483
We'll have ballistics and autopsies later.

163
00:14:34.583 --> 00:14:36.702
I would like to have a report...

164
00:14:36.802 --> 00:14:39.530
...on your security and where it broke down.

165
00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:41.880
You're assuming it broke down.

166
00:14:42.132 --> 00:14:44.957
We have two dead judges, both of whom...

167
00:14:45.057 --> 00:14:47.287
...were being protected by the FBI.

168
00:14:47.387 --> 00:14:49.627
Bob, I'd like a straight answer.

169
00:14:49.723 --> 00:14:51.963
Are these killings in any way...

170
00:14:52.035 --> 00:14:53.377
...linked to the CIA...

171
00:14:53.477 --> 00:14:55.477
...or to any other agency...

172
00:14:55.522 --> 00:14:57.714
...of the United States government?

173
00:14:57.814 --> 00:14:59.716
I'm shocked you'd think that.

174
00:14:59.816 --> 00:15:01.991
Bob, just look into it, okay?

175
00:15:02.152 --> 00:15:04.852
I suggest we meet back here at five.

176
00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:07.405
Five, gentlemen.
Thank you.

177
00:15:15.249 --> 00:15:17.799
It's rally-around-the-leader time.

178
00:15:18.043 --> 00:15:20.283
Your approval ratings will go...

179
00:15:20.346 --> 00:15:21.905
...through the roof.

180
00:15:22.005 --> 00:15:23.200
That's the weather...

181
00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.325
...in New Orleans.
This is Tim Bellew.

182
00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:26.994
We interrupt our program now...

183
00:15:27.094 --> 00:15:28.245
...for a special bulletin.

184
00:15:28.345 --> 00:15:31.623
In a special address, live from the White House...

185
00:15:31.723 --> 00:15:34.573
...the president of the United States.

186
00:15:35.519 --> 00:15:37.519
My fellow Americans...

187
00:15:37.729 --> 00:15:41.024
...our country has suffered a grievous loss.

188
00:15:41.733 --> 00:15:43.733
Last night...

189
00:15:44.194 --> 00:15:48.282
...Supreme Court Justices Rosenberg and Jensen...

190
00:15:48.532 --> 00:15:50.532
...were assassinated.

191
00:15:51.785 --> 00:15:54.107
These assassinations may be an...

192
00:15:54.207 --> 00:15:56.940
...attempt to strike at the very fabric...

193
00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.040
...of our government.

194
00:15:59.376 --> 00:16:01.378
But I can assure each...

195
00:16:02.212 --> 00:16:04.212
...and every American...

196
00:16:04.214 --> 00:16:08.039
...that these dastardly acts will not go unpunished.

197
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:11.955
Everything...

198
00:16:12.055 --> 00:16:16.059
...is being and will be done to bring the culprit...

199
00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.062
...or culprits to justice.

200
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:22.230
For justice must...

201
00:16:22.482 --> 00:16:24.482
...and shall prevail.

202
00:16:26.028 --> 00:16:28.243
I wish you could have known him...

203
00:16:28.343 --> 00:16:30.224
...when I used to clerk for him.

204
00:16:30.324 --> 00:16:33.549
Last time I saw him, only the mind was left.

205
00:16:33.785 --> 00:16:35.810
That's why they killed him.

206
00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:38.004
That mind was still a threat.

207
00:16:39.249 --> 00:16:40.774
But why kill him now,

208
00:16:40.874 --> 00:16:43.274
when he had so little time left?

209
00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.417
Maybe they couldn't take a chance...

210
00:16:45.517 --> 00:16:47.116
...he'd last till the elections.

211
00:16:47.216 --> 00:16:48.016
So why Jensen?

212
00:16:48.116 --> 00:16:49.827
This president nominated him.

213
00:16:49.927 --> 00:16:52.027
He and Rosenberg had almost...

214
00:16:52.086 --> 00:16:54.086
...nothing in common.

215
00:16:54.848 --> 00:16:57.209
That's what they should look for.

216
00:16:57.309 --> 00:17:00.009
Decisions on which they both agreed.

217
00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:03.505
Boy, if there ever was a moment...

218
00:17:03.605 --> 00:17:05.605
...for a drink...

219
00:17:08.111 --> 00:17:10.111
One day at a time, right?

220
00:17:21.834 --> 00:17:23.554
We're talking a conspiracy,

221
00:17:23.654 --> 00:17:25.571
then who are the conspirators?

222
00:17:25.671 --> 00:17:28.051
If we've let foreign terrorists in,

223
00:17:28.118 --> 00:17:30.568
there'll be hell to pay politically.

224
00:17:30.634 --> 00:17:32.815
The intelligence community can't be...

225
00:17:32.915 --> 00:17:35.038
...blamed for a weakness in immigration.

226
00:17:35.138 --> 00:17:37.808
Denton, who are your suspects?

227
00:17:38.809 --> 00:17:41.144
This has to be kept very quiet.

228
00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:44.481
Of course.
This is the Oval Office.

229
00:17:46.316 --> 00:17:48.983
At least 11 Underground Army members...

230
00:17:49.083 --> 00:17:51.054
...have been in the D.C. area...

231
00:17:51.154 --> 00:17:53.454
...and we suspect them in at least...

232
00:17:53.554 --> 00:17:55.726
...100 bombings of abortion clinics...

233
00:17:55.826 --> 00:17:56.679
...porno houses,

234
00:17:56.779 --> 00:17:58.479
gay clubs all over the country.

235
00:17:58.579 --> 00:18:01.429
The truth is, you don't have a suspect.

236
00:18:04.293 --> 00:18:06.293
Correct?

237
00:18:07.171 --> 00:18:09.171
Watch your claws.

238
00:18:15.721 --> 00:18:17.213
Gray Grantham covers the

239
00:18:17.313 --> 00:18:19.833
Supreme Court for the Washington Herald.

240
00:18:19.933 --> 00:18:23.437
You actually interviewed Justice Rosenberg...

241
00:18:23.854 --> 00:18:25.317
...before he was shot on,

242
00:18:25.417 --> 00:18:27.424
as it turned out, the day he died.

243
00:18:27.524 --> 00:18:29.736
Did he say anything that might shed...

244
00:18:29.836 --> 00:18:31.929
...some light on these dreadful events?

245
00:18:32.029 --> 00:18:33.806
Yes. He spoke about things...

246
00:18:33.906 --> 00:18:35.330
...off the record,

247
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:38.327
appropriately for a sitting justice.

248
00:18:38.535 --> 00:18:41.125
But I think it would be appropriate...

249
00:18:41.167 --> 00:18:42.272
...to quote him now.

250
00:18:42.372 --> 00:18:43.842
He said, 'The campaign waged...

251
00:18:43.942 --> 00:18:45.609
...by the president was so ruthless...

252
00:18:45.709 --> 00:18:47.723
...in its manipulation of the...

253
00:18:47.823 --> 00:18:50.030
...middle-class fears of minorities...

254
00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:52.722
...had been so exploitive and divisive...

255
00:18:52.822 --> 00:18:55.285
...that it created a climate of distrust.'

256
00:18:55.385 --> 00:18:59.135
You know, that Grantham's a man after my own heart.

257
00:18:59.848 --> 00:19:01.095
Everyone wants to know...

258
00:19:01.195 --> 00:19:02.960
...when you're starting classes again.

259
00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:05.060
That includes me.

260
00:19:06.563 --> 00:19:08.238
You know what they say:

261
00:19:08.338 --> 00:19:10.738
Drinking makes depression worse.

262
00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.806
What do they recommend for anguish?

263
00:19:13.906 --> 00:19:15.139
Where've you been?

264
00:19:15.239 --> 00:19:17.103
The library. 
I studied a printout...

265
00:19:17.203 --> 00:19:18.642
...of the Supreme Court docket.

266
00:19:18.742 --> 00:19:21.472
I even made a list of possible suspects.

267
00:19:21.495 --> 00:19:23.231
And then threw it away...

268
00:19:23.331 --> 00:19:26.406
...because they'd be obvious to everyone.

269
00:19:26.416 --> 00:19:27.854
Then you looked for areas

270
00:19:27.954 --> 00:19:29.987
Jensen and Rosenberg had in common.

271
00:19:30.087 --> 00:19:31.280
Exactly.

272
00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:34.187
Jensen generally protected the rights...

273
00:19:34.287 --> 00:19:35.826
...of criminal defendants.

274
00:19:35.926 --> 00:19:37.494
Some notable exceptions.

275
00:19:37.594 --> 00:19:39.274
He wrote 3 majority opinions...

276
00:19:39.374 --> 00:19:40.998
...protective of the environment.

277
00:19:41.098 --> 00:19:42.900
And almost always supported...

278
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:43.876
...tax protestors.

279
00:19:43.976 --> 00:19:46.496
So they might have been assassinated...

280
00:19:46.596 --> 00:19:48.589
...by an insatiable tax collector?

281
00:19:48.689 --> 00:19:50.983
As yet, I rule no one out.

282
00:19:51.692 --> 00:19:53.591
Everyone is assuming the motive...

283
00:19:53.691 --> 00:19:54.845
...is hatred or revenge.

284
00:19:54.945 --> 00:19:56.621
Or an attempt to influence...

285
00:19:56.721 --> 00:19:58.515
...the social agenda of the court.

286
00:19:58.615 --> 00:20:00.017
What if the issue involved...

287
00:20:00.117 --> 00:20:01.518
...old-fashioned material greed?

288
00:20:01.618 --> 00:20:04.768
A case that involves a great deal of money?

289
00:20:04.955 --> 00:20:06.076
Can I help you?

290
00:20:06.176 --> 00:20:08.780
I'd like to see this file, please.

291
00:20:08.959 --> 00:20:10.527
Why?

292
00:20:10.627 --> 00:20:12.446
It's public record, isn't it?

293
00:20:12.546 --> 00:20:14.546
Semi-public.

294
00:20:14.548 --> 00:20:16.200
Are you familiar with...

295
00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:18.850
...the Freedom of Information Act?

296
00:20:19.553 --> 00:20:21.038
This file has the pleading...

297
00:20:21.138 --> 00:20:22.411
...and correspondence.

298
00:20:22.511 --> 00:20:24.625
The rest is discovery and the trial.

299
00:20:24.725 --> 00:20:26.376
When was the trial?
Last summer.

300
00:20:26.476 --> 00:20:27.678
Went on for 2 months.

301
00:20:27.704 --> 00:20:28.904
Where's the appeal?

302
00:20:28.979 --> 00:20:30.279
Not perfected yet.

303
00:20:30.379 --> 00:20:33.004
I think the deadline is August 1st.

304
00:22:02.406 --> 00:22:04.406
So, who done it?

305
00:22:05.117 --> 00:22:07.693
You have some obscure suspect unknown...

306
00:22:07.793 --> 00:22:09.646
...to the FBI and the CIA and...

307
00:22:09.746 --> 00:22:11.106
...Secret Service...

308
00:22:11.206 --> 00:22:13.317
...and 10,000 police departments?

309
00:22:13.417 --> 00:22:15.417
I had one...

310
00:22:15.544 --> 00:22:17.796
...which I have now discarded.

311
00:22:19.089 --> 00:22:21.679
You skipped class, ignored me for a...

312
00:22:21.723 --> 00:22:23.577
...week, just to throw it away?

313
00:22:23.677 --> 00:22:25.677
Let me see it.

314
00:22:26.763 --> 00:22:29.229
Don't laugh. It was ludicrous of me...

315
00:22:29.329 --> 00:22:31.001
...to think I could solve it.

316
00:22:31.101 --> 00:22:33.101
Hubris of the young, huh?

317
00:22:33.187 --> 00:22:35.814
Don't knock the hubris that I love.

318
00:22:42.112 --> 00:22:44.112
I'm leaving tomorrow.

319
00:22:44.865 --> 00:22:47.525
I'm going up to Rosenberg's memorial...

320
00:22:47.615 --> 00:22:49.615
...in Washington.

321
00:22:51.371 --> 00:22:54.092
I went through Rosenberg's decisions...

322
00:22:54.192 --> 00:22:56.192
...the other night...

323
00:22:56.668 --> 00:22:58.908
...and in the back of my mind...

324
00:22:58.974 --> 00:23:00.531
...there's an idea...

325
00:23:00.631 --> 00:23:02.491
...to do a book on him.

326
00:23:02.591 --> 00:23:04.591
No one could do it better.

327
00:23:05.677 --> 00:23:08.138
I started making notes...

328
00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:12.015
...about what he meant to me:

329
00:23:12.115 --> 00:23:14.740
surrogate father, mentor, you know.

330
00:23:18.815 --> 00:23:21.485
I started to get very thirsty.

331
00:23:26.406 --> 00:23:28.100
I deserted you this week.

332
00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:30.200
Not the greatest timing.

333
00:23:30.494 --> 00:23:33.719
You're here to study law, not keep me sober.

334
00:23:36.667 --> 00:23:38.667
It's Alice.

335
00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:42.906
Want to come out with me for a burger?

336
00:23:43.006 --> 00:23:45.006
No, thanks.

337
00:23:45.008 --> 00:23:47.636
It might do you good to get out.

338
00:23:48.428 --> 00:23:50.428
I'm fine, thanks.

339
00:23:50.514 --> 00:23:52.514
You sure?
Yes.

340
00:23:54.059 --> 00:23:56.059
Okay, bye.

341
00:24:00.566 --> 00:24:01.800
Hey, Sarge.

342
00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:03.900
Hey, son.

343
00:24:05.237 --> 00:24:07.097
Dark coffee, three sugars.

344
00:24:07.197 --> 00:24:09.057
So how's the president?

345
00:24:09.157 --> 00:24:11.157
Which one?

346
00:24:11.201 --> 00:24:12.770
Not Coal, the real one.

347
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:14.605
Cool and mellow.

348
00:24:14.705 --> 00:24:17.275
Would you believe he's all tore up...

349
00:24:17.375 --> 00:24:19.375
...about Rosenberg?

350
00:24:19.793 --> 00:24:21.793
And all fired up about...

351
00:24:21.962 --> 00:24:23.962
...restructuring the court.

352
00:24:23.964 --> 00:24:25.866
Thinks it'll make his place in history.

353
00:24:25.966 --> 00:24:27.172
Sounds like Coal.

354
00:24:27.198 --> 00:24:28.616
What'd you get me?

355
00:24:28.719 --> 00:24:31.194
There's a short list of nominees.

356
00:24:31.221 --> 00:24:33.244
The original had 20 or so names,

357
00:24:33.344 --> 00:24:34.739
then they cut it to 8.

358
00:24:34.765 --> 00:24:35.651
I gave you 2.

359
00:24:35.726 --> 00:24:37.756
What about the investigation?

360
00:24:37.769 --> 00:24:39.769
I haven't heard much...

361
00:24:39.771 --> 00:24:41.871
...but I'll keep my ears open.

362
00:24:41.899 --> 00:24:44.384
I know you will. Thanks.
#NAME?

363
00:24:44.484 --> 00:24:45.969
I'll see you later.

364
00:24:46.069 --> 00:24:48.069
Mellow, mellow, mellow.

365
00:24:51.283 --> 00:24:53.283
Martini, please.

366
00:24:53.827 --> 00:24:55.996
Good day.
Good to see you.

367
00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:58.916
Another coffee, please.

368
00:25:00.125 --> 00:25:02.225
You read the Grantham article.

369
00:25:02.294 --> 00:25:04.769
It had me running around all day.

370
00:25:05.005 --> 00:25:07.373
Coal blasted the director, saying the...

371
00:25:07.473 --> 00:25:09.660
...judges' names were leaked by the FBI.

372
00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.649
The director said Coal had leaked them...

373
00:25:12.749 --> 00:25:14.540
...himself to test the waters.

374
00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.818
Coal ran the most divisive campaign...

375
00:25:16.918 --> 00:25:17.918
...in 20 years...

376
00:25:18.018 --> 00:25:20.493
...and the president did nothing.

377
00:25:21.271 --> 00:25:23.276
I'd like to have seen your name...

378
00:25:23.376 --> 00:25:24.716
...on this list of judges.

379
00:25:24.816 --> 00:25:26.104
We all voted you...

380
00:25:26.204 --> 00:25:28.679
...most likely to make the court.

381
00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:30.990
These days, it's hard enough...

382
00:25:31.063 --> 00:25:33.063
...just to make my class.

383
00:25:33.742 --> 00:25:35.742
How old is she, this time?

384
00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:38.956
Twenty-four.
 But she's...

385
00:25:39.289 --> 00:25:41.289
...extremely mature.

386
00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.128
At 24, she's mature.

387
00:25:45.337 --> 00:25:47.052
I don't know if I believe that.

388
00:25:47.152 --> 00:25:48.240
Do you have a photo?

389
00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:49.173
No, I don't.

390
00:25:49.199 --> 00:25:50.933
She's not a puppy dog...

391
00:25:51.008 --> 00:25:52.077
...or a grandchild.

392
00:25:52.177 --> 00:25:54.177
Thank God.

393
00:25:55.305 --> 00:25:57.305
Who killed them, Gavin?

394
00:25:57.641 --> 00:26:00.141
I'm just a lawyer with the Bureau,

395
00:26:00.241 --> 00:26:01.962
I'm not an agent.

396
00:26:02.062 --> 00:26:04.912
But, as I recall, you have great ears.

397
00:26:05.649 --> 00:26:08.274
To be honest, we don't have a clue.

398
00:26:10.988 --> 00:26:14.224
My girlfriend wrote a very interesting essay...

399
00:26:14.324 --> 00:26:16.358
...on who might have ordered...

400
00:26:16.458 --> 00:26:17.686
...the assassinations.

401
00:26:17.786 --> 00:26:19.961
Your girlfriend has a theory?

402
00:26:21.331 --> 00:26:24.017
Here, take a look at it. 
You'll get...

403
00:26:24.117 --> 00:26:27.117
...a kick out of the way her mind works.

404
00:26:45.105 --> 00:26:48.192
Is this Gray Grantham? #NAME?

405
00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.633
Sorry to call at such a crazy hour.

406
00:26:50.733 --> 00:26:53.097
I'm at a pay phone on my way to work.

407
00:26:53.197 --> 00:26:56.325
I can't call from home or the office.

408
00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:58.769
What kind of office?

409
00:26:58.869 --> 00:27:00.869
I'm an attorney.

410
00:27:00.871 --> 00:27:02.871
Private or government?

411
00:27:02.873 --> 00:27:04.873
I'd rather not say.

412
00:27:05.209 --> 00:27:06.781
I may know something...

413
00:27:06.881 --> 00:27:09.131
...about Rosenberg and Jensen.

414
00:27:09.379 --> 00:27:11.379
Are you recording this?

415
00:27:11.882 --> 00:27:13.882
Can this call be traced?

416
00:27:14.051 --> 00:27:16.551
I'm not recording it or tracing it.

417
00:27:16.651 --> 00:27:17.621
I promise you.

418
00:27:17.721 --> 00:27:19.746
I may know who killed them.

419
00:27:22.226 --> 00:27:24.226
What's your name?

420
00:27:24.978 --> 00:27:26.978
Garcia.

421
00:27:28.649 --> 00:27:30.649
That's not your real name.

422
00:27:32.861 --> 00:27:35.586
I think I saw something at the office

423
00:27:35.686 --> 00:27:37.686
I wasn't supposed to see.

424
00:27:38.867 --> 00:27:40.867
Do you have a copy?

425
00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:45.105
I need to think about this.

426
00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:48.515
I understand.
- I'm not thinking rationally.

427
00:27:49.086 --> 00:27:51.086
Listen, I promise you...

428
00:27:52.089 --> 00:27:55.539
...I will protect you as a confidential source.

429
00:28:02.099 --> 00:28:04.099
Hello.

430
00:28:18.949 --> 00:28:20.949
Got you.

431
00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:30.175
Mr Grantham's not here,

432
00:28:30.275 --> 00:28:32.900
but he left his car number for you.

433
00:28:35.716 --> 00:28:36.436
It's Garcia.

434
00:28:36.536 --> 00:28:38.410
I still don't know what to do.

435
00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:40.510
Mr Garcia...

436
00:28:40.721 --> 00:28:44.516
...I've gone to jail rather than reveal a source.

437
00:28:45.517 --> 00:28:48.892
I know what kind of hell this must be for you.

438
00:28:49.479 --> 00:28:52.129
You're clearly a decent human being,

439
00:28:52.229 --> 00:28:53.383
a good citizen.

440
00:28:53.483 --> 00:28:55.944
But could you live with yourself...

441
00:28:56.044 --> 00:28:58.819
...if you don't reveal what you know?

442
00:28:59.823 --> 00:29:01.848
MORGAN I'll get back to you.

443
00:29:33.982 --> 00:29:35.982
Taxi.

444
00:29:43.116 --> 00:29:45.456
French authorities reviewed footage...

445
00:29:45.556 --> 00:29:47.771
...from the airport cameras in Paris...

446
00:29:47.871 --> 00:29:49.982
...and think they recognized a face...

447
00:29:50.082 --> 00:29:52.192
...that might be Khamel's, the terrorist.

448
00:29:52.292 --> 00:29:55.053
He may have arrived here on a flight...

449
00:29:55.153 --> 00:29:58.228
...10 hours after we found Jensen's body.

450
00:29:59.007 --> 00:30:01.007
Anything else?

451
00:30:01.093 --> 00:30:03.093
Maybe a small new wrinkle.

452
00:30:05.055 --> 00:30:06.707
What's the wrinkle?

453
00:30:06.807 --> 00:30:09.960
It's a theory that surfaced in the last 24 hours.

454
00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:12.535
Voyles is really intrigued by it.

455
00:30:13.063 --> 00:30:15.487
He's afraid it might be damaging...

456
00:30:15.587 --> 00:30:17.587
...to the president.

457
00:30:19.152 --> 00:30:20.471
How's that?

458
00:30:20.571 --> 00:30:22.671
It's all there in the brief.

499
00:30:32.082 --> 00:30:34.082
It's amateur stuff...

500
00:30:34.084 --> 00:30:36.104
...but how often does something make

501
00:30:36.204 --> 00:30:37.821
Coal sweat and run for cover?

502
00:30:37.921 --> 00:30:40.657
He didn't exactly sweat in front of us.

503
00:30:40.757 --> 00:30:43.627
But his stone face showed he wasn't happy.

504
00:30:43.677 --> 00:30:45.245
Did he have any symptoms?

505
00:30:45.345 --> 00:30:47.175
As I told you, the president...

506
00:30:47.275 --> 00:30:49.166
...is here for his annual check-up.

507
00:30:49.266 --> 00:30:51.043
I wish I was in as good shape.

508
00:30:51.143 --> 00:30:52.439
Was this timed to counter...

509
00:30:52.539 --> 00:30:54.171
...the age issue in the next election?

510
00:30:54.271 --> 00:30:56.271
Why didn't I think of that?

511
00:30:56.273 --> 00:30:58.467
He hasn't decided whether to run again.

512
00:30:58.567 --> 00:31:00.344
When will he decide?

513
00:31:00.444 --> 00:31:03.222
Do you really expect me to answer that?

514
00:31:03.322 --> 00:31:05.064
One rumour I can deny is...

515
00:31:05.164 --> 00:31:07.768
...that he checked in to get away from you.

516
00:31:07.868 --> 00:31:10.043
Although could you blame him?

517
00:31:11.663 --> 00:31:13.663
Thank you again.

518
00:31:14.499 --> 00:31:15.944
Commander, go downstairs...

519
00:31:16.044 --> 00:31:16.714
...and tell them

520
00:31:16.814 --> 00:31:19.029
I have a date for golf this afternoon.

521
00:31:19.129 --> 00:31:21.129
Yes, sir.

522
00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:24.493
It's killing the press you're so healthy.

523
00:31:24.593 --> 00:31:27.137
Good.
Now, what's so important?

524
00:31:27.971 --> 00:31:29.540
This is...

525
00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:31.375
...a brief...

526
00:31:31.475 --> 00:31:33.450
...written by an eager-beaver...

527
00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:34.545
...law student.

528
00:31:34.645 --> 00:31:37.570
It's a theory about the assassinations.

529
00:31:38.232 --> 00:31:39.883
And indirectly...

530
00:31:39.983 --> 00:31:42.458
...it implicates the White House.

531
00:31:43.987 --> 00:31:45.962
The premise is so far-fetched...

532
00:31:46.062 --> 00:31:47.391
...it's absurd.

533
00:31:47.491 --> 00:31:49.551
But Director Voyles, for reasons...

534
00:31:49.651 --> 00:31:51.228
...both you and I can guess...

535
00:31:51.328 --> 00:31:53.328
...is going after it.

536
00:31:56.667 --> 00:31:58.667
Well, we...

537
00:31:58.836 --> 00:32:01.911
We can't interfere with his investigation.

538
00:32:02.005 --> 00:32:05.409
You should ask Giminski to have the CIA investigate.

539
00:32:05.509 --> 00:32:08.234
When we confirm that this is garbage,

540
00:32:08.334 --> 00:32:10.659
you can ask Voyles to back off.

541
00:32:11.181 --> 00:32:13.181
It's domestic.

542
00:32:14.142 --> 00:32:16.342
The CIA can't go nosing around.

543
00:32:16.442 --> 00:32:17.921
It's illegal.

544
00:32:18.021 --> 00:32:20.021
Yes, technically.

545
00:32:22.401 --> 00:32:23.635
What about...

546
00:32:23.735 --> 00:32:25.345
...your friend...

547
00:32:25.445 --> 00:32:28.866
...Barr, and the Unit, I think you call it.

548
00:32:29.658 --> 00:32:31.658
I've spoken to Barr.

549
00:32:32.035 --> 00:32:33.013
They're very good...

550
00:32:33.113 --> 00:32:34.605
...for small specific missions...

551
00:32:34.705 --> 00:32:36.730
...but they aren't the CIA.

552
00:32:37.541 --> 00:32:40.341
How does it implicate the White House?

553
00:32:40.441 --> 00:32:42.112
What are there, names?

554
00:32:42.212 --> 00:32:44.212
One name.

555
00:32:45.465 --> 00:32:47.465
Someone we both know?

556
00:33:11.491 --> 00:33:13.911
Mr President...

557
00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:22.986
I've decided my agenda for the future.

558
00:33:23.086 --> 00:33:25.214
I'll stay in bed...

559
00:33:25.839 --> 00:33:27.839
...drink...

560
00:33:28.091 --> 00:33:30.091
...make love...

561
00:33:31.136 --> 00:33:33.986
...and forget the whole damn business.

562
00:33:35.807 --> 00:33:37.807
You don't approve.

563
00:33:38.727 --> 00:33:40.712
What about the book on Rosenberg?

564
00:33:40.812 --> 00:33:42.812
You should write it.

565
00:33:43.815 --> 00:33:45.815
Let's go.
#NAME?

566
00:33:45.943 --> 00:33:48.218
You have the youth, the energy,

567
00:33:48.318 --> 00:33:49.221
the certitude.

568
00:33:49.321 --> 00:33:51.321
You'd be perfect.

569
00:33:51.782 --> 00:33:53.782
Can I have the keys?

570
00:33:59.164 --> 00:34:01.834
I'm perfectly capable of driving.

571
00:34:02.543 --> 00:34:04.543
You've drunk too much.

572
00:34:08.549 --> 00:34:10.549
Give me the keys.

573
00:34:11.844 --> 00:34:13.550
Remember the Mashed Potato?

574
00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:14.705
Give me the keys.

575
00:34:14.805 --> 00:34:16.665
You're too young.
#NAME?

576
00:34:16.765 --> 00:34:19.017
Do you remember the Fishback?

577
00:34:19.309 --> 00:34:21.311
The Slide?
#NAME?

578
00:34:21.562 --> 00:34:23.887
Please what?
#NAME?

579
00:34:23.981 --> 00:34:25.197
Give me the keys.

580
00:34:25.223 --> 00:34:27.081
I'll drive or I'll walk.

581
00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:29.150
You'll walk?
Yes.

582
00:34:31.321 --> 00:34:33.321
Have a nice stroll.

583
00:34:43.083 --> 00:34:45.083
Miss Shaw.

584
00:34:46.795 --> 00:34:50.591
You take my breath away.

585
00:34:56.847 --> 00:34:58.847
Thomas.

586
00:35:01.185 --> 00:35:03.520
Oh, my God.

587
00:35:22.623 --> 00:35:24.623
Watch the door.

588
00:35:27.961 --> 00:35:30.589
I'm Sergeant Rupert, NOPD.

589
00:35:31.882 --> 00:35:33.884
You'll be safe in my car.

590
00:35:38.472 --> 00:35:40.472
Your name?

591
00:35:47.397 --> 00:35:49.397
Darby Shaw.

592
00:35:53.445 --> 00:35:55.445
Let's go.

593
00:36:02.162 --> 00:36:04.162
Is this your car?

594
00:36:07.417 --> 00:36:09.417
Come here.

595
00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:12.195
I'm Lieutenant Olsen, NOPD.

596
00:36:12.631 --> 00:36:14.956
I'm taking you to the hospital.

597
00:36:15.592 --> 00:36:17.592
Check the plates.

598
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:20.870
Did you know the man in the car?

599
00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:28.270
Thomas Callahan.

600
00:36:39.283 --> 00:36:41.283
It'll be a few minutes.

601
00:36:42.953 --> 00:36:45.203
Are you sure that the man who...

602
00:36:45.303 --> 00:36:48.528
...called himself Rupert said he was a cop?

603
00:36:52.296 --> 00:36:54.105
We don't have a record of a cop...

604
00:36:54.205 --> 00:36:55.741
...named Rupert. The computer...

605
00:36:55.841 --> 00:36:58.743
...has no record of the tag numbers of...

606
00:36:58.843 --> 00:37:01.618
...the car you were in. 
Must be fake.

607
00:37:02.723 --> 00:37:05.273
I'll go move the car.
I'll be back.

608
00:37:05.642 --> 00:37:07.642
All right?

609
00:40:14.873 --> 00:40:16.873
Gavin Verheek?

610
00:40:17.167 --> 00:40:18.434
This is Darby Shaw.

611
00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:19.967
Do you know who I am?

612
00:40:20.003 --> 00:40:22.631
We have a mutual friend.

613
00:40:23.006 --> 00:40:25.706
Thomas gave you a copy of my theory.

614
00:40:25.843 --> 00:40:27.077
Yes, he did.

615
00:40:27.177 --> 00:40:29.177
Where is it?

616
00:40:29.179 --> 00:40:30.792
I read it and I showed it...

617
00:40:30.892 --> 00:40:32.624
...to some folks at the Bureau...

618
00:40:32.724 --> 00:40:35.104
...who sent it to Director Voyles.

619
00:40:35.185 --> 00:40:37.885
Has it been seen outside of the FBI?

620
00:40:37.896 --> 00:40:39.896
I can't answer that.

621
00:40:40.065 --> 00:40:41.707
Then I won't tell you...

622
00:40:41.807 --> 00:40:43.982
...what's happened to Thomas.

623
00:40:44.862 --> 00:40:46.680
Okay, yes.

624
00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:49.055
It's been seen outside the FBI,

625
00:40:49.155 --> 00:40:51.155
but by whom I don't know.

626
00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:53.353
He's dead, Gavin.

627
00:40:53.453 --> 00:40:55.356
He was murdered.
Someone planted...

628
00:40:55.456 --> 00:40:56.857
...a car bomb for both of us.

629
00:40:56.957 --> 00:40:59.507
I got lucky, but they're after me.

630
00:41:01.712 --> 00:41:03.229
What's your phone number?

631
00:41:03.329 --> 00:41:04.156
Where are you?

632
00:41:04.256 --> 00:41:06.256
Not so fast.

633
00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:08.393
Come on. Thomas Callahan...

634
00:41:08.493 --> 00:41:10.162
...was my best friend.

635
00:41:10.262 --> 00:41:12.292
I'll have agents pick you up.

636
00:41:12.368 --> 00:41:14.398
You can't stay on the street.

637
00:41:14.474 --> 00:41:16.640
Thomas is dead because he talked...

638
00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:18.462
...to you. Tell that to Voyles.

639
00:41:18.562 --> 00:41:20.837
Turn up the TV,

640
00:41:20.937 --> 00:41:23.487
I can't hear Regis and Kathie Lee.

641
00:41:25.903 --> 00:41:27.903
Down.

642
00:41:32.826 --> 00:41:34.826
Mr President.

643
00:41:35.329 --> 00:41:37.329
Sit down.
You must see this.

644
00:41:37.342 --> 00:41:40.025
We've been working on this all morning.

645
00:41:40.125 --> 00:41:42.155
You have your first audience.

646
00:41:42.252 --> 00:41:44.421
Over. Roll over.

647
00:41:46.006 --> 00:41:47.408
Roll over.

648
00:41:47.508 --> 00:41:50.058
How serious is this Pelican thing?

649
00:41:50.844 --> 00:41:53.330
I've assigned 14 agents in New Orleans.

650
00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:55.534
I doubt if there's anything to it,

651
00:41:55.634 --> 00:41:57.167
but we must check it out.

652
00:41:57.267 --> 00:41:59.267
I don't have to tell you...

653
00:41:59.269 --> 00:42:01.183
...how much trouble and pain...

654
00:42:01.283 --> 00:42:03.006
...this nonsense could cause...

655
00:42:03.106 --> 00:42:05.346
...if the press gets wind of it.

656
00:42:05.442 --> 00:42:08.612
Oh, well, you got half of it.
Good boy.

657
00:42:11.114 --> 00:42:12.850
I just wish...

658
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:14.518
...that you'd...

659
00:42:14.618 --> 00:42:16.618
...back off the thing...

660
00:42:17.454 --> 00:42:18.689
I mean...

661
00:42:18.789 --> 00:42:20.874
...it's a goose chase.

662
00:42:21.124 --> 00:42:23.849
Are you asking me to ignore a suspect,

663
00:42:23.949 --> 00:42:25.949
Mr President?

664
00:42:26.255 --> 00:42:27.906
If the press...

665
00:42:28.006 --> 00:42:29.659
...gets wind of what you're after...

666
00:42:29.759 --> 00:42:31.034
...and starts digging, I'll be-

667
00:42:31.134 --> 00:42:33.134
We'll be crucified.

668
00:42:37.808 --> 00:42:40.208
So you're asking me to back off?

669
00:42:43.981 --> 00:42:46.756
Back off and chase the real suspects.

670
00:42:47.484 --> 00:42:50.334
Ignore it for a few weeks, that's all.

671
00:42:51.029 --> 00:42:53.536
Your hatchet man did a real number on me...

672
00:42:53.636 --> 00:42:55.726
...with the press.
They ate my lunch...

673
00:42:55.826 --> 00:42:57.394
...over the security...

674
00:42:57.494 --> 00:43:00.194
...we provided Jensen and Rosenberg.

675
00:43:01.373 --> 00:43:03.723
Get that pit bull off my ass and

676
00:43:03.823 --> 00:43:06.748
I'll forget the Pelican theory a while.

677
00:45:27.019 --> 00:45:29.019
May I have your card?

678
00:45:30.022 --> 00:45:32.022
I'll pay with cash.

679
00:45:34.318 --> 00:45:36.318
Verheek.
Yes.

680
00:45:37.237 --> 00:45:39.239
What did Voyles say?

681
00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:43.035
Mr Voyles has been unavailable.

682
00:45:43.327 --> 00:45:45.637
But I will try to speak to him...

683
00:45:45.715 --> 00:45:47.715
...later this afternoon.

684
00:45:49.333 --> 00:45:51.333
I expected more.

685
00:45:51.543 --> 00:45:54.243
There's a memorial service tomorrow.

686
00:45:54.254 --> 00:45:56.465
I'll be there tonight.

687
00:45:56.673 --> 00:45:58.673
I think we should meet.

688
00:45:58.842 --> 00:46:01.261
Darby, I can save your life.

689
00:46:02.179 --> 00:46:04.879
You can't even talk to the director.

690
00:46:07.684 --> 00:46:09.684
Where will you stay?

691
00:46:10.103 --> 00:46:12.523
At the Westin, by the river.

692
00:46:15.192 --> 00:46:17.192
Okay.

693
00:46:44.555 --> 00:46:46.555
She's watching TV.

694
00:46:47.057 --> 00:46:48.877
They've been looking under...

695
00:46:48.977 --> 00:46:50.461
...rocks. She's using credit cards.

696
00:46:50.561 --> 00:46:52.586
She'll be dead in 48 hours.

697
00:46:52.729 --> 00:46:54.729
I'll give her 72.

698
00:46:55.899 --> 00:46:57.968
We'll meet at 6 A.M.

699
00:46:58.068 --> 00:47:00.068
All right, Bob.

700
00:47:00.612 --> 00:47:02.612
Hooten, stay.

701
00:47:08.745 --> 00:47:12.249
This means her little brief is right on point.

702
00:47:13.542 --> 00:47:15.792
Will you notify the president?

703
00:47:16.336 --> 00:47:18.530
Notifying the president...

704
00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:20.632
...means notifying Coal.

705
00:47:21.258 --> 00:47:22.827
Gray Grantham's article...

706
00:47:22.927 --> 00:47:24.995
...in tomorrow's Washington Herald...

707
00:47:25.095 --> 00:47:26.370
...maintains that, according...

708
00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:27.831
...to unnamed White House sources...

709
00:47:27.931 --> 00:47:30.591
...the Mid-Eastern terrorist, Khamel...

710
00:47:30.601 --> 00:47:33.191
...may be among those who assassinated

711
00:47:33.229 --> 00:47:35.214
Justices Rosenberg and Jensen.

712
00:47:35.314 --> 00:47:37.853
Those sources say that a country known...

713
00:47:37.953 --> 00:47:40.177
...for sponsoring terrorist activity...

714
00:47:40.277 --> 00:47:42.277
...may have hired Khamel.

715
00:47:47.492 --> 00:47:48.685
It's Garcia.

716
00:47:48.785 --> 00:47:50.030
I'm on the corner of

717
00:47:50.130 --> 00:47:52.022
Pennsylvania Avenue and First.

718
00:47:52.122 --> 00:47:54.023
Take down my license number;...

719
00:47:54.123 --> 00:47:56.527
...there's a lot of grey Volvos out there.

720
00:47:56.627 --> 00:47:58.627
8-5-6...

721
00:47:59.630 --> 00:48:01.630
...V-N-N.

722
00:48:03.634 --> 00:48:05.202
Right.

723
00:48:05.302 --> 00:48:07.302
Ten minutes.
Yes.

724
00:48:14.311 --> 00:48:16.311
My keys.

725
00:48:21.318 --> 00:48:23.318
I can't do it.

726
00:48:25.739 --> 00:48:28.158
Let's get together anyway.

727
00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:31.242
You'll feel better if we meet...

728
00:48:31.342 --> 00:48:33.230
...and you don't have to reveal anything.

729
00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:35.355
I have a wife and daughter.

730
00:48:35.999 --> 00:48:38.402
There's a chance they know that I know.

731
00:48:38.502 --> 00:48:40.070
The guys at the firm?

732
00:48:40.170 --> 00:48:42.720
I didn't tell you I was in a firm.

733
00:48:43.173 --> 00:48:46.326
You go to work too early to be a government lawyer.

734
00:48:46.426 --> 00:48:49.747
You must work at a firm where they expect people...

735
00:48:49.847 --> 00:48:52.622
...to work at least 100 hours a week.

736
00:49:12.369 --> 00:49:14.975
Garcia, we can work this thing out...

737
00:49:15.075 --> 00:49:17.775
...if you just get together with me.

738
00:49:17.875 --> 00:49:19.875
Garcia?

739
00:49:21.044 --> 00:49:22.613
Who's this?

740
00:49:22.713 --> 00:49:24.713
Is this Gray Grantham?

741
00:49:24.715 --> 00:49:26.715
Yes. Who's this?

742
00:49:27.593 --> 00:49:30.293
Have you heard of the Pelican Brief?

743
00:49:30.554 --> 00:49:32.206
The what?

744
00:49:32.306 --> 00:49:34.306
Pelican Brief.

745
00:49:37.269 --> 00:49:39.269
No. Never heard of it.

746
00:49:39.396 --> 00:49:41.161
It's an unlikely little theory...

747
00:49:41.261 --> 00:49:43.300
...about who killed Rosenberg and Jensen.

748
00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:45.886
A friend of mine took it to Washington.

749
00:49:45.986 --> 00:49:47.822
He gave it to a friend in the FBI...

750
00:49:47.922 --> 00:49:49.181
...and it was passed around.

751
00:49:49.281 --> 00:49:51.906
My friend was killed in a car bomb.

752
00:49:52.576 --> 00:49:54.576
Wait now.

753
00:49:54.745 --> 00:49:57.289
Your friend took it to the FBI...

754
00:49:57.581 --> 00:49:59.442
...and then he was killed?

755
00:49:59.468 --> 00:50:00.756
What's his name?

756
00:50:01.752 --> 00:50:03.752
I can't tell you that.

757
00:50:04.588 --> 00:50:06.757
How do you know all this?

758
00:50:07.257 --> 00:50:09.257
I wrote the brief.

759
00:50:10.844 --> 00:50:12.496
Are you a lawyer?

760
00:50:12.596 --> 00:50:14.596
No.

761
00:50:15.098 --> 00:50:17.123
Where are you calling from?

762
00:50:17.768 --> 00:50:19.192
I'd rather you not...

763
00:50:19.292 --> 00:50:21.467
...ask me any more questions.

764
00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:23.480
You called me.

765
00:50:23.482 --> 00:50:25.482
What's your name?

766
00:50:25.484 --> 00:50:27.945
Alice.
#NAME?

767
00:50:29.363 --> 00:50:31.752
Can you get a list of the major...

768
00:50:31.852 --> 00:50:34.442
...presidential campaign contributors?

769
00:50:34.535 --> 00:50:37.287
Yes. Sure.
I can have it tomorrow.

770
00:50:38.956 --> 00:50:41.356
You know who did these killings?

771
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.000
Yes.

772
00:50:45.295 --> 00:50:46.924
Let's cut to the chase.

773
00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:47.870
Who did it?

774
00:50:48.298 --> 00:50:49.500
Let's take it slow.

775
00:50:49.526 --> 00:50:50.726
I'll be in touch.

776
00:50:50.801 --> 00:50:52.801
When?

777
00:51:25.794 --> 00:51:27.154
Hi.

778
00:51:27.254 --> 00:51:28.906
How are you?

779
00:51:29.006 --> 00:51:31.006
How are you?

780
00:51:32.885 --> 00:51:35.135
Did you get into my apartment?

781
00:51:35.846 --> 00:51:37.846
Your computer's gone.

782
00:51:38.432 --> 00:51:40.000
So are your floppy disks.

783
00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:42.352
And your red expandable files.

784
00:51:44.855 --> 00:51:47.030
I need you to do me a favour.

785
00:51:47.941 --> 00:51:50.791
Go to the memorial service tomorrow...

786
00:51:51.528 --> 00:51:54.183
...and spread the word I called to say

787
00:51:54.283 --> 00:51:56.725
I'm staying with an aunt in Denver.

788
00:51:56.825 --> 00:51:59.150
And I won't be back until fall.

789
00:52:01.371 --> 00:52:03.371
What is going on?

790
00:52:07.961 --> 00:52:09.961
Are you okay about money?

791
00:52:11.381 --> 00:52:14.006
I have the money my father left me.

792
00:52:16.637 --> 00:52:18.637
Who are you hiding from?

793
00:52:23.727 --> 00:52:26.202
I think you better go now, Alice.

794
00:52:33.487 --> 00:52:36.490
It would be better for me if you go now.

795
00:52:54.424 --> 00:52:56.424
That's not fair.

796
00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:59.260
The prettiest girl in the Quarter,

797
00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:01.760
the saddest girl in the Quarter.

798
00:53:02.432 --> 00:53:05.057
I can't get you to give me a smile?

799
00:53:10.524 --> 00:53:12.176
I saw that.

800
00:53:12.276 --> 00:53:14.276
That's something.

801
00:53:22.202 --> 00:53:24.202
Just one beer?
No.

802
00:53:26.123 --> 00:53:28.373
I've found my mission in life.

803
00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:30.027
To make you smile.

804
00:53:30.127 --> 00:53:32.377
You must find another mission.

805
00:53:41.013 --> 00:53:43.013
Wait.

806
00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:45.915
Will you marry me, just for 5 minutes?

807
00:53:45.934 --> 00:53:47.026
I know it's stupid,

808
00:53:47.126 --> 00:53:49.421
but I think we're fated for each other.

809
00:53:49.521 --> 00:53:51.090
I must go now.

810
00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:54.635
Please, you're not going to walk out on me, are you?

811
00:53:54.735 --> 00:53:56.862
I'd walk a million miles

812
00:53:57.154 --> 00:53:59.154
For one of your smiles

813
00:53:59.323 --> 00:54:00.766
You beautiful

814
00:54:00.866 --> 00:54:02.392
You wonderful girl

815
00:54:02.492 --> 00:54:04.745
From the laundry

816
00:54:07.831 --> 00:54:09.831
You've got the wrong girl.

817
00:54:12.085 --> 00:54:14.085
Go get her.

818
00:54:43.992 --> 00:54:45.992
Please, help me.

819
00:55:34.042 --> 00:55:35.861
Looking for Mr Sneller.

820
00:55:35.961 --> 00:55:37.321
Mr Sneller?

821
00:55:37.421 --> 00:55:39.965
Yes, Mr Edwin F. Sneller.

822
00:56:33.465 --> 00:56:35.045
Have you heard from Darby?

823
00:56:35.145 --> 00:56:36.547
Yes, I did.

824
00:56:36.647 --> 00:56:37.945
I got a note from her.

825
00:56:38.045 --> 00:56:40.384
She's staying with an aunt in Colorado.

826
00:56:40.484 --> 00:56:43.529
But she's going to be back next semester.

827
00:56:55.499 --> 00:56:57.499
I'll see you later.

828
00:57:23.151 --> 00:57:25.151
Gavin, it's Darby.

829
00:57:26.363 --> 00:57:28.866
I'd just about given up on you.

830
00:57:29.867 --> 00:57:31.477
Tell me where you want to meet...

831
00:57:31.577 --> 00:57:32.936
...and I'll come with 3 agents.

832
00:57:33.036 --> 00:57:35.272
I thought the FBI was not involved.

833
00:57:35.372 --> 00:57:38.522
It's not involved, not yet. I have friends.

834
00:57:38.750 --> 00:57:40.868
We can get you out of the city tonight,

835
00:57:40.968 --> 00:57:42.196
in Washington tomorrow.

836
00:57:42.296 --> 00:57:44.715
I promise you'll meet Voyles.

837
00:57:44.923 --> 00:57:46.923
We'll go from there.

838
00:57:47.176 --> 00:57:48.191
At noon tomorrow,

839
00:57:48.291 --> 00:57:50.120
take the trolley to Riverwalk.

840
00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:52.220
Wait, Riverwalk?

841
00:57:52.472 --> 00:57:55.997
Wear a long sleeve shirt and a red baseball cap.

842
00:57:56.393 --> 00:57:59.393
Wait on the riverside at the bandstand...

843
00:57:59.438 --> 00:58:01.215
...and I'll find you.

844
00:58:01.315 --> 00:58:03.315
The riverside bandstand.

845
00:58:05.235 --> 00:58:07.321
How tall are you?
- 5'10'.

846
00:58:07.571 --> 00:58:09.098
Your weight?

847
00:58:09.198 --> 00:58:10.198
About 180,

848
00:58:10.298 --> 00:58:11.975
but I'm planning on losing it.

849
00:58:12.075 --> 00:58:14.075
I'll see you tomorrow.

850
00:58:14.077 --> 00:58:16.077
Tomorrow.

Gavin, it's Darby.

892
01:00:38.263 --> 01:00:40.588
I'd just about given up on you.

893
01:00:41.391 --> 01:00:43.701
Tell me where you want to meet...

894
01:00:43.794 --> 01:00:45.796
...and I'll come with 3 agents.

895
01:00:45.896 --> 01:00:48.565
I thought the FBI was not involved.

896
01:00:49.233 --> 01:00:51.258
It's not involved, not yet.

897
01:00:51.485 --> 01:00:53.303
I have friends.

898
01:00:53.403 --> 01:00:55.993
We'll get you out of the city tonight,

899
01:00:56.015 --> 01:00:57.516
in Washington tomorrow.

900
01:00:57.616 --> 01:00:59.993
I promise you'll meet Voyles.

901
01:01:00.452 --> 01:01:02.312
We'll go from there.

902
01:01:02.412 --> 01:01:03.690
At noon tomorrow,

903
01:01:03.790 --> 01:01:06.083
take the trolley to Riverwalk.

904
01:01:07.918 --> 01:01:11.071
Wear a long sleeve shirt and a red baseball cap.

905
01:01:11.171 --> 01:01:13.660
Wait on the riverside at the bandstand...

906
01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:14.825
...and I'll find you.

907
01:01:14.925 --> 01:01:16.925
The riverside bandstand?

908
01:01:19.429 --> 01:01:21.429
How tall are you?
- 5'10'.

909
01:01:21.598 --> 01:01:22.916
Your weight?

910
01:01:23.016 --> 01:01:24.016
About 180,

911
01:01:24.116 --> 01:01:26.366
but I'm planning on losing it.

912
01:01:27.271 --> 01:01:29.271
All right.

913
01:01:33.402 --> 01:01:35.877
Tell me where you want to meet...

914
01:01:37.698 --> 01:01:40.017
Tell me where you want to meet...

915
01:01:40.117 --> 01:01:41.642
...and within an hour

916
01:01:41.742 --> 01:01:44.142
I'll come get you with 3 agents.

917
01:05:18.669 --> 01:05:21.004
Mr Sneller on line 2.

918
01:05:25.717 --> 01:05:26.788
Khamel is dead.

919
01:05:26.814 --> 01:05:28.742
We don't know who did it.

920
01:05:29.137 --> 01:05:31.167
And the girl?
- She's running.

921
01:05:31.181 --> 01:05:33.475
We lost her.
We'll find her.

922
01:05:50.033 --> 01:05:52.133
There's been another murder.

923
01:05:52.202 --> 01:05:54.302
You remember my friend gave...

924
01:05:54.395 --> 01:05:57.095
...the brief to a friend at the FBI?

925
01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.700
The FBI friend was killed yesterday.

926
01:06:02.546 --> 01:06:04.546
How do you know?

927
01:06:05.257 --> 01:06:07.910
I was holding his hand. He was shot...

928
01:06:08.010 --> 01:06:10.345
...in broad daylight in a crowd.

929
01:06:12.014 --> 01:06:14.014
I'm very sorry.

930
01:06:14.057 --> 01:06:16.752
I'm in New York now. When can you come?

931
01:06:16.852 --> 01:06:20.302
You'll have to give me something I can confirm.

932
01:06:20.564 --> 01:06:23.282
We get crank calls from people claiming...

933
01:06:23.382 --> 01:06:25.969
...to know who killed Rosenberg and Jensen.

934
01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:28.069
Something you can confirm?

935
01:06:28.238 --> 01:06:29.556
Please.

936
01:06:29.656 --> 01:06:31.656
Such as?

937
01:06:32.075 --> 01:06:33.812
The name of the friend...

938
01:06:33.912 --> 01:06:37.062
...that was murdered in the car explosion.

939
01:06:39.082 --> 01:06:41.082
Take your time.

940
01:06:42.169 --> 01:06:44.169
Callahan.

941
01:06:45.547 --> 01:06:47.157
His first name?

942
01:06:47.257 --> 01:06:48.659
Thomas.

943
01:06:48.759 --> 01:06:50.759
Where did it happen?

944
01:06:51.094 --> 01:06:52.169
In New Orleans.

945
01:06:52.269 --> 01:06:54.519
I think that should be enough.

946
01:06:57.392 --> 01:06:59.392
All right.

947
01:07:01.188 --> 01:07:03.428
What's the name of the friend...

948
01:07:03.519 --> 01:07:05.519
...that worked at the FBI?

949
01:07:05.776 --> 01:07:07.594
Verheek.

950
01:07:07.694 --> 01:07:09.694
Gavin Verheek.

951
01:07:10.113 --> 01:07:12.113
Voyles' Chief Counsel.

952
01:07:12.324 --> 01:07:14.724
I think that's more than enough.

953
01:07:16.453 --> 01:07:18.439
I'll be on a plane this afternoon.

954
01:07:18.539 --> 01:07:21.124
You must follow my instructions.

955
01:07:35.347 --> 01:07:37.347
This is Gray Grantham.

956
01:07:39.726 --> 01:07:41.726
That's right.

957
01:07:45.148 --> 01:07:47.148
Got it.

958
01:08:02.749 --> 01:08:05.074
Did you follow my instructions?

959
01:08:05.669 --> 01:08:07.669
Yes.

960
01:08:37.826 --> 01:08:39.826
You must think I'm crazy.

961
01:08:41.288 --> 01:08:43.288
Yes, I did...

962
01:08:44.791 --> 01:08:47.041
...till I checked New Orleans.

963
01:08:47.503 --> 01:08:49.503
Callahan was...

964
01:08:49.671 --> 01:08:51.921
...killed exactly as you said.

965
01:08:51.924 --> 01:08:53.623
I also checked Verheek.

966
01:08:53.649 --> 01:08:55.494
According to the FBI...

967
01:08:55.719 --> 01:08:58.419
...they found his body 2 days ago...

968
01:08:58.514 --> 01:09:01.514
...in a hotel room early in the morning.

969
01:09:02.935 --> 01:09:05.635
He'd been dead for at least 8 hours.

970
01:09:07.481 --> 01:09:09.481
That can't be.

971
01:09:11.443 --> 01:09:13.618
Want to talk about the brief?

972
01:09:15.948 --> 01:09:19.098
Everyone I've told about the brief is dead.

973
01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:21.910
I'll take my chances.

974
01:09:22.913 --> 01:09:25.488
You can't, under any circumstances,

975
01:09:25.588 --> 01:09:26.817
use my name...

976
01:09:26.917 --> 01:09:29.570
...or reveal how you got the information.

977
01:09:29.670 --> 01:09:31.356
Or publish anything until

978
01:09:31.456 --> 01:09:33.556
I've left the country. Agreed?

979
01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:35.576
Unless I can convince you otherwise.

980
01:09:35.676 --> 01:09:37.676
You can't.

981
01:09:40.889 --> 01:09:42.889
May I sit down?

982
01:09:45.936 --> 01:09:48.186
Mind if I use a tape recorder?

983
01:09:59.741 --> 01:10:01.869
Interesting read, isn't it?

984
01:10:03.996 --> 01:10:05.996
What'd the president say?

985
01:10:06.707 --> 01:10:08.707
He spoke to Voyles...

986
01:10:10.002 --> 01:10:12.927
...who will leave it alone for a while.

987
01:10:13.297 --> 01:10:16.222
The president asked Voyles to back off?

988
01:10:16.508 --> 01:10:18.896
We thought it was just another shot...

989
01:10:18.996 --> 01:10:20.871
...in the dark.
Now I'm not sure.

990
01:10:20.971 --> 01:10:22.956
That's obstruction of justice.

991
01:10:23.056 --> 01:10:26.056
Assuming the brief turns out to be true.

992
01:10:26.268 --> 01:10:28.893
If it does, you'll be the fall guy.

993
01:10:32.274 --> 01:10:34.274
I won't be the only one.

994
01:10:34.568 --> 01:10:36.568
The old Nixon two-step.

995
01:10:37.279 --> 01:10:39.304
Don't even think that name.

996
01:10:39.531 --> 01:10:42.643
Look at the hopeful side, Iran gate, Iraq gate...

997
01:10:42.743 --> 01:10:44.993
Good chance it won't come out.

998
01:10:46.038 --> 01:10:48.038
What's up with Grantham?

999
01:10:48.624 --> 01:10:49.966
We got his car phone.

1000
01:10:50.066 --> 01:10:52.403
We haven't been inside the home yet.

1001
01:10:52.503 --> 01:10:54.071
Why not?

1002
01:10:54.171 --> 01:10:57.246
We almost got caught by the cleaning lady.

1003
01:11:01.428 --> 01:11:03.847
Grantham knows about the brief.

1004
01:11:04.431 --> 01:11:07.281
He called 3 White House aides today...

1005
01:11:07.434 --> 01:11:09.434
...and God knows who else.

1006
01:11:09.937 --> 01:11:11.595
What made you hone in...

1007
01:11:11.695 --> 01:11:14.285
...on this particular case so quickly?

1008
01:11:14.358 --> 01:11:16.161
I remembered this piece...

1009
01:11:16.261 --> 01:11:19.036
...that 'Frontline' did a year ago...

1010
01:11:20.030 --> 01:11:24.155
...about the young lawyer who originally filed the suit.

1011
01:11:25.077 --> 01:11:27.502
They said he'd committed suicide,

1012
01:11:27.602 --> 01:11:30.602
but his family thought it was foul play.

1013
01:11:34.962 --> 01:11:38.337
After the assassinations, I called his family.

1014
01:11:38.549 --> 01:11:39.882
They said he had...

1015
01:11:39.982 --> 01:11:42.703
...a depressive problem years before...

1016
01:11:42.803 --> 01:11:45.728
...but medication had taken care of it.

1017
01:11:47.015 --> 01:11:50.090
His doctor confirmed what the family said.

1018
01:11:50.894 --> 01:11:52.486
They told the police...

1019
01:11:52.586 --> 01:11:55.736
...they were not convinced it was suicide.

1020
01:11:57.693 --> 01:12:00.618
But the police closed the investigation.

1021
01:12:02.489 --> 01:12:04.489
Exactly.

1022
01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:12.624
That's it.
That's the brief.

1023
01:12:17.129 --> 01:12:19.129
Maybe we could...

1024
01:12:19.131 --> 01:12:21.425
...finish up in the morning?

1025
01:12:33.145 --> 01:12:35.631
I'll be up late going over my notes...

1026
01:12:35.731 --> 01:12:38.281
...while they're fresh in my head.

1027
01:12:39.693 --> 01:12:41.693
Call me when you wake up.

1028
01:12:45.073 --> 01:12:47.073
Try and get some sleep.

1029
01:12:55.918 --> 01:12:57.918
Mr Grantham.

1030
01:13:01.131 --> 01:13:03.381
I know it sounds silly, but...

1031
01:13:04.968 --> 01:13:07.293
...would you sleep on the sofa?

1032
01:13:11.975 --> 01:13:13.975
No problem.

1033
01:13:20.442 --> 01:13:22.442
Good night.

1034
01:13:22.945 --> 01:13:24.945
Listen...

1035
01:13:24.947 --> 01:13:27.947
At the risk of sounding old-fashioned...

1036
01:13:28.158 --> 01:13:31.083
...isn't it time I knew your real name?

1037
01:13:33.705 --> 01:13:35.705
Darby Shaw.

1038
01:13:36.834 --> 01:13:39.309
What made you pick me, Darby Shaw?

1039
01:13:42.714 --> 01:13:44.714
Callahan was a fan.

1040
01:13:55.102 --> 01:13:57.057
Does the name Victor Mattiece...

1041
01:13:57.157 --> 01:13:58.422
...mean anything to you?

1042
01:13:58.522 --> 01:13:59.631
Money.

1043
01:13:59.731 --> 01:14:01.731
Power.

1044
01:14:01.733 --> 01:14:03.733
Influence.

1045
01:14:04.111 --> 01:14:06.272
He's made and lost several...

1046
01:14:06.372 --> 01:14:09.222
...fortunes drilling oil in Louisiana.

1047
01:14:10.492 --> 01:14:12.492
In 1979...

1048
01:14:12.536 --> 01:14:14.785
...his oil company punched some holes...

1049
01:14:14.885 --> 01:14:16.732
...in Terrebonne Parish and hit oil.

1050
01:14:16.832 --> 01:14:18.650
A lot of oil.

1051
01:14:18.750 --> 01:14:21.200
He needed governmental permission...

1052
01:14:21.295 --> 01:14:23.536
...to dredge a channel though...

1053
01:14:23.636 --> 01:14:26.156
...the marshlands to get the oil out.

1054
01:14:26.175 --> 01:14:27.202
Enter Mattiece,

1055
01:14:27.302 --> 01:14:29.620
the great campaign contributor...

1056
01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:31.205
...and as night follows day...

1057
01:14:31.305 --> 01:14:33.189
...government permission...

1058
01:14:33.289 --> 01:14:36.514
...to gouge through the endangered marshes.

1059
01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:39.922
Mattiece is that close to at least a billion dollars...

1060
01:14:40.022 --> 01:14:41.548
...when Green Fund...

1061
01:14:41.648 --> 01:14:43.801
...an obscure environmental outfit...

1062
01:14:43.901 --> 01:14:46.233
...trots down to the U.S. District court...

1063
01:14:46.333 --> 01:14:48.222
...in Lafayette and files a lawsuit...

1064
01:14:48.322 --> 01:14:50.722
...to stop the entire operation.

1065
01:14:51.033 --> 01:14:53.460
Of course, Mattiece spares no expense...

1066
01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:54.686
...to win the lawsuit.

1067
01:14:54.786 --> 01:14:57.156
I don't think there's a top law firm...

1068
01:14:57.256 --> 01:14:59.316
...between Houston and New Orleans...

1069
01:14:59.416 --> 01:15:01.416
...that he hasn't hired.

1070
01:15:01.877 --> 01:15:03.877
Fucking PBS.

1071
01:15:04.296 --> 01:15:07.071
By the time the Green Fund lawyers...

1072
01:15:07.090 --> 01:15:08.325
...all two of them...

1073
01:15:08.425 --> 01:15:10.494
...wade in, the joint ventures...

1074
01:15:10.594 --> 01:15:12.113
...limited partnerships...

1075
01:15:12.213 --> 01:15:13.914
...and corporate associations...

1076
01:15:14.014 --> 01:15:15.990
...form an impenetrable maze...

1077
01:15:16.090 --> 01:15:18.001
...that makes Mattiece invisible.

1078
01:15:18.101 --> 01:15:20.761
Luckily for the Green Fund's lawsuit...

1079
01:15:20.854 --> 01:15:23.225
...the heart of the new oil reserve...

1080
01:15:23.325 --> 01:15:25.759
...is near a natural refuge for waterfowl:

1081
01:15:25.859 --> 01:15:30.239
Osprey, egrets, pelicans, ducks, cranes, geese.

1082
01:15:30.781 --> 01:15:33.033
The pelican becomes the hero.

1083
01:15:33.283 --> 01:15:35.663
After 30 years of contamination...

1084
01:15:35.763 --> 01:15:38.238
...by DDT and other pesticides...

1085
01:15:38.622 --> 01:15:40.422
...the Louisiana brown pelican is...

1086
01:15:40.522 --> 01:15:41.859
...on the brink of extinction.

1087
01:15:41.959 --> 01:15:45.154
Green Fund seizes the bird and enlists experts...

1088
01:15:45.254 --> 01:15:48.949
...from around the country to testify on its behalf.

1089
01:15:49.049 --> 01:15:51.779
It takes 7 years for the pelican suit...

1090
01:15:51.816 --> 01:15:53.871
...to go to trial in Lake Charles.

1091
01:15:53.971 --> 01:15:55.882
The 3-man jury, caring less...

1092
01:15:55.982 --> 01:15:57.958
...about the pelicans than jobs...

1093
01:15:58.058 --> 01:16:00.383
...votes in favour of Mattiece.

1094
01:16:01.228 --> 01:16:03.218
But the judge rules to keep the...

1095
01:16:03.318 --> 01:16:05.549
...injunction against drilling because...

1096
01:16:05.649 --> 01:16:07.432
...he thinks Green Fund has proven...

1097
01:16:07.532 --> 01:16:08.969
...its point about the pelican...

1098
01:16:09.069 --> 01:16:11.494
...a federally-protected species,

1099
01:16:11.594 --> 01:16:13.594
and that it will appeal.

1100
01:16:13.657 --> 01:16:15.757
What's the lawsuit's status?

1101
01:16:16.159 --> 01:16:18.020
From the trial level...

1102
01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:20.710
...it will be appealed to the Court...

1103
01:16:20.803 --> 01:16:23.317
...of Appeals in New Orleans in a month.

1104
01:16:23.417 --> 01:16:25.657
Any idea what the court will do?

1105
01:16:25.669 --> 01:16:27.669
It could be reversed.

1106
01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:30.550
Then the fun starts. If either side...

1107
01:16:30.650 --> 01:16:32.576
...is unhappy with the court...

1108
01:16:32.676 --> 01:16:34.995
...they can appeal to the Supreme Court.

1109
01:16:35.095 --> 01:16:37.404
From today, how long would it take...

1110
01:16:37.504 --> 01:16:39.750
...for a decision by the Supreme Court?

1111
01:16:39.850 --> 01:16:42.019
Anywhere from 3 to 5 years.

1112
01:16:42.269 --> 01:16:44.269
Rosenberg would have died.

1113
01:16:44.396 --> 01:16:46.582
But another president could be...

1114
01:16:46.682 --> 01:16:48.801
...in the White House when he died.

1115
01:16:48.901 --> 01:16:50.594
So if you're Mattiece...

1116
01:16:50.694 --> 01:16:52.478
...and you don't mind killing...

1117
01:16:52.578 --> 01:16:53.847
...a couple of Supremes...

1118
01:16:53.947 --> 01:16:55.608
...now's the time to kill them,

1119
01:16:55.708 --> 01:16:57.810
when you can predict their replacement.

1120
01:16:57.910 --> 01:16:59.394
But why Jensen?

1121
01:16:59.494 --> 01:17:00.797
He shared one piece...

1122
01:17:00.897 --> 01:17:02.815
...of common ground with Rosenberg:

1123
01:17:02.915 --> 01:17:04.940
Protecting the environment.

1124
01:17:47.251 --> 01:17:49.251
I didn't mean to wake you.

1125
01:17:57.553 --> 01:18:00.444
You said that Mattiece hired law firms...

1126
01:18:00.544 --> 01:18:02.869
...from Houston to New Orleans.

1127
01:18:03.475 --> 01:18:05.650
Were there any in Washington?

1128
01:18:06.562 --> 01:18:08.562
Maybe two.

1129
01:18:10.023 --> 01:18:12.023
White & Blazevich...

1130
01:18:14.278 --> 01:18:16.780
...and Brim, Stearns & Somebody.

1131
01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:20.240
Great.

1132
01:18:20.242 --> 01:18:22.811
I got a call from a lawyer in D.C...

1133
01:18:22.911 --> 01:18:24.127
...who saw something...

1134
01:18:24.227 --> 01:18:25.939
...concerning Rosenberg and Jensen.

1135
01:18:26.039 --> 01:18:28.069
He backed out of our meeting.

1136
01:18:28.167 --> 01:18:30.197
I never heard from him again.

1137
01:18:30.294 --> 01:18:33.744
He gave me a phony name, but I got his picture.

1138
01:18:34.131 --> 01:18:35.491
How?

1139
01:18:35.591 --> 01:18:38.461
Long story. If he works at one of these...

1140
01:18:38.495 --> 01:18:41.163
...law firms, he could be our confirmation.

1141
01:18:41.263 --> 01:18:43.263
I hope you find him.

1142
01:18:44.474 --> 01:18:46.499
Come with me to Washington.

1143
01:18:48.729 --> 01:18:50.729
I've had enough.

1144
01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:53.112
If you're right about Mattiece,

1145
01:18:53.212 --> 01:18:54.718
then there'll be a cover-up.

1146
01:18:54.818 --> 01:18:56.512
It'll probably work.

1147
01:18:56.612 --> 01:18:58.305
How do you know?

1148
01:18:58.405 --> 01:19:01.255
I called the Herald morgue last night.

1149
01:19:01.617 --> 01:19:04.542
Two years ago, a reporter did a piece...

1150
01:19:04.661 --> 01:19:06.111
...on 'Violations of

1151
01:19:06.211 --> 01:19:08.211
Campaign Financing Laws.'

1152
01:19:08.415 --> 01:19:10.307
He found out that, hidden under...

1153
01:19:10.407 --> 01:19:12.528
...a lot of other names of individuals...

1154
01:19:12.628 --> 01:19:14.728
...and PAC's and corporations,

1155
01:19:14.811 --> 01:19:17.533
Mattiece was the biggest contributor...

1156
01:19:17.633 --> 01:19:18.992
...by far...

1157
01:19:19.092 --> 01:19:20.994
...to the president's campaign.

1158
01:19:21.094 --> 01:19:23.349
We ran a picture, with the article,

1159
01:19:23.449 --> 01:19:25.374
of the president and Mattiece.

1160
01:19:25.474 --> 01:19:28.252
It was taken unbeknownst to either one.

1161
01:19:28.352 --> 01:19:30.110
In it, the president and Mattiece are...

1162
01:19:30.210 --> 01:19:31.922
...in front of Mattiece's hunting lodge...

1163
01:19:32.022 --> 01:19:33.640
...sipping on some bourbon,

1164
01:19:33.740 --> 01:19:34.925
having a good laugh.

1165
01:19:35.025 --> 01:19:36.677
The best of pals.

1166
01:19:36.777 --> 01:19:37.793
The captions said:

1167
01:19:37.893 --> 01:19:39.680
'The President's Most Secret...

1168
01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:42.366
...and Generous Contributor.'

1169
01:19:43.867 --> 01:19:45.482
Now if your brief is right...

1170
01:19:45.582 --> 01:19:47.771
...and it ever reaches the light of day...

1171
01:19:47.871 --> 01:19:50.607
...the president loses any chance of re-election.

1172
01:19:50.707 --> 01:19:52.306
The men around the president...

1173
01:19:52.406 --> 01:19:53.527
...won't let that happen.

1174
01:19:53.627 --> 01:19:55.322
I checked with my sources.

1175
01:19:55.422 --> 01:19:58.082
The Bureau, Langley, the White House...

1176
01:19:58.090 --> 01:20:00.790
...all said the brief doesn't exist.

1177
01:20:02.678 --> 01:20:05.191
You may be the only witness to the fact...

1178
01:20:05.291 --> 01:20:07.499
...there is a brief. If you disappear...

1179
01:20:07.599 --> 01:20:09.599
...so does justice.

1180
01:20:12.729 --> 01:20:15.204
Is that what Callahan would want?

1181
01:20:18.485 --> 01:20:21.260
He'd want me to see my 25th birthday.

1182
01:20:22.906 --> 01:20:24.558
Darby.

1183
01:20:24.658 --> 01:20:26.556
If this thing reaches as deep...

1184
01:20:26.656 --> 01:20:28.979
...and goes as high as we think it does...

1185
01:20:29.079 --> 01:20:32.079
...they'll do anything not to be exposed.

1186
01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:35.110
Where can you hide?

1187
01:20:35.210 --> 01:20:37.210
Go back to Washington.

1188
01:20:46.638 --> 01:20:48.175
They're all shook up...

1189
01:20:48.275 --> 01:20:50.501
...about you asking about something.

1190
01:20:50.601 --> 01:20:51.752
I expected that.

1191
01:20:51.852 --> 01:20:53.463
It's like the Gestapo over there.

1192
01:20:53.563 --> 01:20:54.671
Coal clears everything.

1193
01:20:54.771 --> 01:20:56.634
They put me on medical leave...

1194
01:20:56.734 --> 01:20:57.424
...for 90 days.

1195
01:20:57.524 --> 01:20:59.843
What's wrong with you?
- I don't know.

1196
01:20:59.943 --> 01:21:03.543
One thing I do know, I've never seen it this bad.

1197
01:21:03.655 --> 01:21:05.680
I'm worried about you, son.

1198
01:21:09.953 --> 01:21:11.688
Gray, it's Darby.

1199
01:21:11.788 --> 01:21:14.664
When you hear this, I'll be in the air...

1200
01:21:14.764 --> 01:21:16.764
...on my way to nowhere.

1201
01:21:17.669 --> 01:21:19.669
Try to understand.

1202
01:21:20.756 --> 01:21:23.081
I can't keep you on that story.

1203
01:21:23.217 --> 01:21:25.217
I'm sending you to Arkansas.

1204
01:21:25.260 --> 01:21:27.260
The Times, the networks...

1205
01:21:27.262 --> 01:21:29.382
...are there checking out the judge...

1206
01:21:29.482 --> 01:21:30.916
...they're about to nominate.

1207
01:21:31.016 --> 01:21:32.459
I need more time.

1208
01:21:32.559 --> 01:21:33.710
For what?

1209
01:21:33.810 --> 01:21:36.317
You lost your White House sources,

1210
01:21:36.417 --> 01:21:38.817
you've lost Garcia and the girl.

1211
01:21:38.982 --> 01:21:40.982
Not your best week.

1212
01:21:41.652 --> 01:21:44.127
You can't take me off this story.

1213
01:21:45.656 --> 01:21:47.224
What do you know for fact?

1214
01:21:47.324 --> 01:21:48.891
An unidentified guy says...

1215
01:21:48.991 --> 01:21:50.978
...he knows about the assassinations.

1216
01:21:51.078 --> 01:21:53.506
He works in a law firm, you don't know...

1217
01:21:53.606 --> 01:21:55.732
...which one. He's cut off all contact.

1218
01:21:55.832 --> 01:21:58.001
That's not very promising.

1219
01:21:58.502 --> 01:22:01.502
There's something there, I can smell it.

1220
01:22:02.089 --> 01:22:04.606
Evidence based on olfactory prowess is...

1221
01:22:04.706 --> 01:22:07.035
...inadmissible, in case you didn't know.

1222
01:22:07.135 --> 01:22:08.579
Then there's a girl...

1223
01:22:08.679 --> 01:22:10.244
...with her bird brief for which...

1224
01:22:10.344 --> 01:22:11.540
...you can't get confirmation.

1225
01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:12.708
Not yet.

1226
01:22:12.808 --> 01:22:14.841
She also cut off contact, something...

1227
01:22:14.941 --> 01:22:16.920
...that's reaching epidemic proportions.

1228
01:22:17.020 --> 01:22:19.089
They're waiting for you upstairs.

1229
01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:21.189
Everything she said about...

1230
01:22:21.237 --> 01:22:23.635
...the two deaths has been confirmed.

1231
01:22:23.735 --> 01:22:25.625
The FBI says Verheek was killed...

1232
01:22:25.725 --> 01:22:26.930
...in some hotel mugging.

1233
01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:28.099
That's what you told me.

1234
01:22:28.125 --> 01:22:29.416
- That's what they told me.

1235
01:22:29.491 --> 01:22:30.788
And they said they knew of...

1236
01:22:30.888 --> 01:22:32.603
...no connection with the assassinations.

1237
01:22:32.703 --> 01:22:34.441
What else would they say?

1238
01:22:34.541 --> 01:22:37.065
I'm interested in what they did say.

1239
01:22:37.165 --> 01:22:39.865
Let's look at what I have confirmed.

1240
01:22:39.877 --> 01:22:41.150
Callahan was killed.

1241
01:22:41.250 --> 01:22:42.452
He was a professor.

1242
01:22:42.478 --> 01:22:43.806
They had an affair.

1243
01:22:43.881 --> 01:22:45.505
Give it to the Times-Picayune.

1244
01:22:45.605 --> 01:22:47.117
Maybe they want some gossip.

1245
01:22:47.217 --> 01:22:48.797
I also found that Callahan clerked...

1246
01:22:48.897 --> 01:22:50.037
...for Rosenberg 20 years ago.

1247
01:22:50.137 --> 01:22:52.456
Life is filled with odd coincidence.

1248
01:22:52.556 --> 01:22:54.291
Not a coincidence if the brief-

1249
01:22:54.391 --> 01:22:56.794
You have no confirmation there is a brief.

1250
01:22:56.894 --> 01:22:58.687
I confirmed Verheek and Callahan...

1251
01:22:58.787 --> 01:22:59.421
...were friends.

1252
01:22:59.521 --> 01:23:01.396
They met here a few weeks ago,

1253
01:23:01.496 --> 01:23:03.884
when he must have given him the brief.

1254
01:23:03.984 --> 01:23:04.835
Supposition again.

1255
01:23:04.935 --> 01:23:06.637
I've confirmed the pelican lawsuit.

1256
01:23:06.737 --> 01:23:09.615
On which she has based her suppositions.

1257
01:23:09.715 --> 01:23:11.740
It's all just suppositions.

1258
01:23:11.742 --> 01:23:13.685
You know what Mattiece could do?

1259
01:23:13.785 --> 01:23:15.813
I know what he has done already.

1260
01:23:15.913 --> 01:23:17.731
He has a bizarre history.

1261
01:23:17.831 --> 01:23:19.400
So do I, according to my ex-wife. It...

1262
01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:21.110
...doesn't mean that I killed the Justices.

1263
01:23:21.210 --> 01:23:23.760
But it means it's worth exploring.

1264
01:23:25.172 --> 01:23:27.902
Go down to that crappy cabin of yours...

1265
01:23:27.964 --> 01:23:30.244
...on the weekend, hole up, retrench.

1266
01:23:30.344 --> 01:23:32.959
Prove you have a way to revitalize...

1267
01:23:33.059 --> 01:23:36.209
...this story, and I might keep you on it.

1268
01:23:37.184 --> 01:23:41.384
But if I were you, I'd check where to eat in Little Rock.

1269
01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:47.946
This is the story of...

1270
01:23:48.046 --> 01:23:50.472
...a mystery that may never be solved.

1271
01:23:50.572 --> 01:23:52.960
The story of a brilliant young lawyer...

1272
01:23:53.060 --> 01:23:54.351
...who loved this land...

1273
01:23:54.451 --> 01:23:56.666
...and wanted to fight to preserve it...

1274
01:23:56.766 --> 01:23:58.188
...from the inroads of man...

1275
01:23:58.288 --> 01:23:59.940
...until his abrupt death...

1276
01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:02.040
...a few months ago.

1277
01:24:03.377 --> 01:24:05.769
His body was found in a lonely cottage,

1278
01:24:05.869 --> 01:24:07.948
near the Louisiana bayou he loved.

1279
01:24:08.048 --> 01:24:10.242
There was a bullet in his head...

1280
01:24:10.342 --> 01:24:12.342
...and a gun beside him.

1281
01:24:12.845 --> 01:24:16.370
The coroner and police have deemed it a suicide.

1282
01:24:16.598 --> 01:24:18.666
But he died sitting at a computer,

1283
01:24:18.766 --> 01:24:20.335
surrounded by his notes...

1284
01:24:20.435 --> 01:24:22.081
...for what he called...

1285
01:24:22.181 --> 01:24:24.506
...the case he was born to win.

1286
01:24:24.982 --> 01:24:27.157
His friends and family ask...

1287
01:24:27.317 --> 01:24:29.163
...would anyone commit suicide...

1288
01:24:29.263 --> 01:24:30.304
...in such a manner...

1289
01:24:30.404 --> 01:24:32.404
...at such a time?

1290
01:24:33.115 --> 01:24:37.015
Tonight, Frontline explores a young idealist's death.

1291
01:25:26.126 --> 01:25:28.126
Who's there?

1292
01:25:29.171 --> 01:25:31.171
It's Darby.

1293
01:25:51.735 --> 01:25:53.735
I got your message.

1294
01:25:55.030 --> 01:25:57.030
If they bugged your phone,

1295
01:25:57.030 --> 01:25:59.580
they'd think I'd left the country.

1296
01:26:05.958 --> 01:26:08.433
Did you find that lawyer in D.C.?

1297
01:26:08.961 --> 01:26:10.779
Not yet.

1298
01:26:10.879 --> 01:26:13.879
My editor wants to take me off the story.

1299
01:26:15.175 --> 01:26:17.175
I could help you find him.

1300
01:26:20.347 --> 01:26:22.347
How'd you find me?

1301
01:26:23.392 --> 01:26:25.519
I called your editor.

1302
01:26:27.229 --> 01:26:29.229
He told you?

1303
01:26:31.984 --> 01:26:34.526
I told him I was your sister Mary...

1304
01:26:34.626 --> 01:26:37.776
...from out of town and couldn't find you.

1305
01:26:39.783 --> 01:26:42.408
How'd you know I had a sister Mary?

1306
01:26:43.287 --> 01:26:46.212
You're not the only one doing research.

1307
01:27:12.983 --> 01:27:15.152
It was a beautiful service.

1308
01:27:15.485 --> 01:27:18.113
Thank you, Mr President.

1309
01:27:29.333 --> 01:27:32.558
I'll have an announcement after the weekend.

1310
01:27:42.346 --> 01:27:44.471
It was the right thing to do,

1311
01:27:44.571 --> 01:27:47.196
no matter where the body was found.

1312
01:27:54.191 --> 01:27:56.552
You can't announce the nominations next week.

1313
01:27:56.652 --> 01:27:58.929
You said they'd be vetted this weekend.

1314
01:27:59.029 --> 01:28:00.931
There must be a change in plans.

1315
01:28:01.031 --> 01:28:03.031
I don't understand.

1316
01:28:03.450 --> 01:28:05.450
The Pelican Brief.

1317
01:28:06.954 --> 01:28:09.129
What about the Pelican Brief?

1318
01:28:09.164 --> 01:28:11.834
I thought that was ancient history.

1319
01:28:12.084 --> 01:28:15.384
We believe that Grantham's gotten hold of it.

1320
01:28:15.838 --> 01:28:18.949
Mattiece will sue them if they try to publish that.

1321
01:28:19.049 --> 01:28:21.049
Not if it's true.

1322
01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:28.640
You think it's true?

1323
01:28:29.226 --> 01:28:31.626
I know what Grantham will write:

1324
01:28:31.979 --> 01:28:34.131
'A man who gave the president millions...

1325
01:28:34.231 --> 01:28:36.201
...had two Supreme Court Justices killed...

1326
01:28:36.301 --> 01:28:37.301
...so the president...

1327
01:28:37.401 --> 01:28:40.271
...could appoint more reasonable judges...

1328
01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:42.870
...so his oil could be harvested.'

1329
01:28:43.115 --> 01:28:45.449
If Voyles says you told him to back off...

1330
01:28:45.549 --> 01:28:47.770
...the case, we face an obstruction charge.

1331
01:28:47.870 --> 01:28:49.870
Oh, Jesus.

1332
01:28:52.666 --> 01:28:54.841
There's a way to handle this.

1333
01:28:54.918 --> 01:28:56.918
Handle it how?

1334
01:28:57.671 --> 01:28:59.646
We appoint two nature-lovers...

1335
01:28:59.746 --> 01:29:00.949
...to the court.

1336
01:29:01.049 --> 01:29:02.730
Good environmentalists...

1337
01:29:02.830 --> 01:29:05.412
...who'd kill Mattiece and his oil field.

1338
01:29:05.512 --> 01:29:07.656
Meet with Voyles, in the presence...

1339
01:29:07.756 --> 01:29:09.291
...of the Attorney General...

1340
01:29:09.391 --> 01:29:11.292
...and demand an investigation...

1341
01:29:11.392 --> 01:29:12.169
...into Mattiece.

1342
01:29:12.269 --> 01:29:15.172
I'll leak the brief to every reporter in town.

1343
01:29:15.272 --> 01:29:17.649
Then we ride out the storm.

1344
01:29:18.233 --> 01:29:20.893
But there has to be some way to keep...

1345
01:29:20.918 --> 01:29:23.097
...this information from coming out.

1346
01:29:23.197 --> 01:29:25.197
I'm working on it.

1347
01:29:26.533 --> 01:29:28.185
What?
How?

1348
01:29:28.285 --> 01:29:29.978
Mr President...

1349
01:29:30.078 --> 01:29:32.078
...you don't want to know.

1350
01:29:42.591 --> 01:29:44.591
What's this all about?

1351
01:29:44.635 --> 01:29:46.662
A trip to Mt. Vernon will do you good.

1352
01:29:46.762 --> 01:29:48.762
Are you losing it?

1353
01:29:48.972 --> 01:29:50.984
First I order you to go to Little Rock,

1354
01:29:51.084 --> 01:29:52.084
you refuse to go.

1355
01:29:52.184 --> 01:29:55.295
You refuse to tell me why, then you order me...

1356
01:29:55.395 --> 01:29:57.495
...your boss, I might add...

1357
01:29:57.606 --> 01:29:59.132
...to drop everything...

1358
01:29:59.232 --> 01:30:01.218
...and meet you at George's place.

1359
01:30:01.318 --> 01:30:03.887
I thought of making you unemployed...

1360
01:30:03.987 --> 01:30:06.181
...but you'd sue me for discrimination.

1361
01:30:06.281 --> 01:30:08.058
She's here.

1362
01:30:08.158 --> 01:30:10.183
The bird girl?
- She's here.

1363
01:30:11.453 --> 01:30:13.480
You could've told me.
#NAME?

1364
01:30:13.580 --> 01:30:15.502
By the way, refusing to tell me...

1365
01:30:15.602 --> 01:30:17.234
...where you could be reached...

1366
01:30:17.334 --> 01:30:19.236
...didn't leave a good impression.

1367
01:30:19.336 --> 01:30:21.139
It's too risky to go
to my apartment...

1368
01:30:21.239 --> 01:30:22.239
...or to the job.

1369
01:30:22.339 --> 01:30:24.908
Where have you been?
#NAME?

1370
01:30:25.008 --> 01:30:26.333
This is a hell of a time...

1371
01:30:26.433 --> 01:30:27.911
...to punch notches in your belt.

1372
01:30:28.011 --> 01:30:29.633
We're not in the same hotel.

1373
01:30:29.733 --> 01:30:31.415
She's helping me find Garcia.

1374
01:30:31.515 --> 01:30:34.017
It sounds like she's in control.

1375
01:30:34.309 --> 01:30:36.086
It's the only way she'd play.

1376
01:30:36.186 --> 01:30:38.255
So what if you can't find Garcia?

1377
01:30:38.355 --> 01:30:40.355
We go to plan B.
What's that?

1378
01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:42.150
We attack the lawyers directly.

1379
01:30:42.250 --> 01:30:43.677
What if it's another firm?

1380
01:30:43.777 --> 01:30:45.262
We go to plan C.
What's that?

1381
01:30:45.362 --> 01:30:46.823
We didn't go that far.

1382
01:30:46.849 --> 01:30:47.977
What if you do?

1383
01:30:48.031 --> 01:30:51.031
I must be able to get in touch with you.

1384
01:30:52.035 --> 01:30:55.043
I'm at the Marbury Hotel, room 833.

1385
01:30:55.143 --> 01:30:56.899
Don't use my name.

1386
01:30:56.999 --> 01:30:58.999
Write it down.

1387
01:31:00.377 --> 01:31:02.654
You mind getting off at the next exit?

1388
01:31:02.754 --> 01:31:04.239
Why?

1389
01:31:04.339 --> 01:31:07.189
A tan car's been two cars behind us...

1390
01:31:07.467 --> 01:31:10.012
...since we got on the parkway.

1431
01:31:29.281 --> 01:31:31.381
I thought it was following us.

1432
01:31:31.408 --> 01:31:33.408
Right.

1433
01:32:15.410 --> 01:32:17.660
Georgetown Law School, please.

1434
01:32:24.211 --> 01:32:26.211
Hurry.

1435
01:33:31.945 --> 01:33:33.945
Meet me by the stacks.

1436
01:33:47.794 --> 01:33:49.794
Someone was in my room.

1437
01:33:51.715 --> 01:33:53.784
Did you tell anyone where you were?

1438
01:33:53.884 --> 01:33:56.659
Smith Keen, but he'd never repeat it.

1439
01:33:56.803 --> 01:33:58.803
Did you tell him by phone?

1440
01:33:58.805 --> 01:34:00.805
No.
We were...

1441
01:34:01.642 --> 01:34:03.642
We were in his car.

1442
01:34:03.644 --> 01:34:05.504
Georgetown Law Center.
Placement Office, please.

1443
01:34:05.604 --> 01:34:07.756
One moment, please.
Placement Office.

1444
01:34:07.856 --> 01:34:09.091
This is Susan Johnson.

1445
01:34:09.191 --> 01:34:11.301
I'm a partner with White & Blazevich.

1446
01:34:11.401 --> 01:34:15.155
We're trying to reconstruct some payroll records.

1447
01:34:15.405 --> 01:34:18.158
May I have the names of your students...

1448
01:34:18.258 --> 01:34:20.310
...that clerked here last summer?

1449
01:34:20.410 --> 01:34:22.410
I'm from White & Blazevich.

1450
01:34:22.485 --> 01:34:24.485
You have something for me?

1451
01:34:25.958 --> 01:34:28.252
Would you sign this, please?

1452
01:34:34.883 --> 01:34:36.453
Thank you, Mr Stevens.

1453
01:34:36.479 --> 01:34:37.833
- You're welcome.

1454
01:34:37.970 --> 01:34:40.414
I'll call these five and see who's home.

1455
01:34:40.514 --> 01:34:43.409
I'll take the two with no phone number...

1456
01:34:43.509 --> 01:34:45.984
...and get their class schedules.

1457
01:34:50.774 --> 01:34:52.774
See you later.

1458
01:34:57.531 --> 01:34:59.806
I'm from the Washington Herald.

1459
01:34:59.906 --> 01:35:01.143
I'm looking for...

1460
01:35:01.243 --> 01:35:02.812
...Robert Akers and Laura Kaas.

1461
01:35:02.912 --> 01:35:03.854
Is there a problem?

1462
01:35:03.954 --> 01:35:04.954
No.

1463
01:35:05.054 --> 01:35:06.815
Just a few questions I want to ask.

1464
01:35:06.915 --> 01:35:09.240
Are they in class this morning?

1465
01:35:10.586 --> 01:35:12.586
One moment, please.

1466
01:35:19.636 --> 01:35:21.413
Excuse me.

1467
01:35:21.513 --> 01:35:23.513
Do you have ID?

1468
01:35:24.808 --> 01:35:28.020
Could I speak to Dennis Maylor, please?

1469
01:35:29.021 --> 01:35:31.046
No, I'm Keith Maylor.

1470
01:35:31.064 --> 01:35:33.275
I'm sorry to bother you.

1471
01:35:38.614 --> 01:35:40.644
Akers has Criminal Procedure,

1472
01:35:40.714 --> 01:35:42.714
Kaas has Administrative Law.

1473
01:35:42.743 --> 01:35:44.478
I'll try to find them. Maylor,

1474
01:35:44.578 --> 01:35:46.730
Reinhart and Wilson were all at home.

1475
01:35:46.830 --> 01:35:48.830
I can go to Maylor's.

1476
01:35:50.959 --> 01:35:52.194
Excuse me.

1477
01:35:52.294 --> 01:35:54.027
Do you know Laura Kaas?

1478
01:35:54.127 --> 01:35:56.944
She's the girl with the red backpack.

1479
01:36:02.513 --> 01:36:04.513
Do you recognize this man?

1480
01:36:04.513 --> 01:36:07.138
He's a lawyer at White & Blazevich.

1481
01:36:07.476 --> 01:36:09.336
We're down to Akers and Linney.

1482
01:36:09.436 --> 01:36:11.380
Linney's phone was disconnected.

1483
01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:13.340
I'll get his class schedule.

1484
01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:15.540
I'll keep looking for Akers.

1485
01:36:15.776 --> 01:36:17.776
It's me again.

1486
01:36:17.778 --> 01:36:20.597
I need the class schedule for Edward Linney.

1487
01:36:20.697 --> 01:36:22.697
I'm sorry, Mr Grantham.

1488
01:36:22.699 --> 01:36:24.854
A student you talked to called

1489
01:36:24.954 --> 01:36:27.771
White & Blazevich, who called the Dean.

1490
01:36:27.871 --> 01:36:30.721
No more class schedules for reporters.

1491
01:36:41.969 --> 01:36:43.969
Mr Grantham.

1492
01:36:44.805 --> 01:36:46.805
I know Edward.

1493
01:36:46.890 --> 01:36:49.765
He's dropped out of school for a while.

1494
01:36:49.865 --> 01:36:51.587
Personal problems.

1495
01:36:51.687 --> 01:36:53.046
Where is he?

1496
01:36:53.146 --> 01:36:56.221
His parents put him in a private hospital.

1497
01:36:56.567 --> 01:36:58.610
He's being detoxified.

1498
01:37:00.696 --> 01:37:02.990
Look, he's a good guy.

1499
01:37:04.658 --> 01:37:06.658
Parklane Hospital.

1500
01:37:31.268 --> 01:37:33.268
Good afternoon.

1501
01:37:34.188 --> 01:37:36.188
May I see Edward Linney?

1502
01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:37.581
What room is he in?

1503
01:37:37.607 --> 01:37:38.867
- What's your name?

1504
01:37:38.942 --> 01:37:41.778
Gray Grantham, Washington Herald.

1505
01:37:42.362 --> 01:37:45.062
The law school said I could see him.

1506
01:37:45.407 --> 01:37:47.807
I'm sorry they did.

1507
01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:49.737
We run this hospital...

1508
01:37:49.837 --> 01:37:52.312
...and they run their law school.

1509
01:37:52.664 --> 01:37:54.839
May I see your administrator?

1510
01:37:55.709 --> 01:37:57.734
I'll see if I can find him.

1511
01:38:22.986 --> 01:38:24.555
Mr Grantham.

1512
01:38:24.655 --> 01:38:26.655
Great architecture.

1513
01:38:26.907 --> 01:38:28.907
I'm sorry, Mr Grantham.

1514
01:38:29.076 --> 01:38:30.435
Visitation...

1515
01:38:30.535 --> 01:38:32.146
...is only allowed on the weekend...

1516
01:38:32.246 --> 01:38:34.246
...and then only family.

1517
01:38:34.498 --> 01:38:36.625
When will he be discharged?

1518
01:38:37.934 --> 01:38:40.259
I'm afraid that's confidential.

1519
01:38:40.838 --> 01:38:43.463
Perhaps when his insurance expires?

1520
01:38:45.634 --> 01:38:47.634
Do you recognize that man?

1521
01:38:49.346 --> 01:38:51.346
What's his name?

1522
01:38:51.932 --> 01:38:54.268
That's the point, I don't know.

1523
01:38:55.853 --> 01:38:57.853
What is his name?

1524
01:39:01.441 --> 01:39:04.086
He works in the oil and gas section...

1525
01:39:04.186 --> 01:39:06.186
...on the 9th floor.

1526
01:39:09.950 --> 01:39:11.950
Morgan.

1527
01:39:13.620 --> 01:39:15.620
Yes. Morgan.

1528
01:39:16.248 --> 01:39:18.066
His first name's something like...

1529
01:39:18.166 --> 01:39:20.502
...Charles, but that's not it.

1530
01:39:21.545 --> 01:39:24.170
I can't tell you how grateful I am.

1531
01:39:26.842 --> 01:39:28.867
When you opened the door...

1532
01:39:30.345 --> 01:39:32.820
...I thought I was hallucinating.

1533
01:39:34.057 --> 01:39:36.057
I'm sorry.

1534
01:39:36.977 --> 01:39:39.827
I'll take a hallucination like that...

1535
01:39:40.063 --> 01:39:42.063
...anytime.

1536
01:39:44.318 --> 01:39:46.318
Take care of yourself.

1537
01:39:51.632 --> 01:39:52.800
Excuse me, miss.

1538
01:39:52.826 --> 01:39:54.357
What are you doing?

1539
01:39:54.411 --> 01:39:55.813
Visiting my brother.

1540
01:39:55.913 --> 01:39:57.481
Who is your brother?

1541
01:39:57.581 --> 01:39:59.581
Edward Linney.

1542
01:40:00.501 --> 01:40:02.501
This your sister?

1543
01:40:08.008 --> 01:40:09.785
Yes.

1544
01:40:09.885 --> 01:40:11.885
Leave her alone.

1545
01:40:12.804 --> 01:40:14.979
Mom will come on the weekend.

1546
01:40:15.307 --> 01:40:17.307
Sis?

1547
01:40:17.309 --> 01:40:18.836
Come back soon.

1548
01:40:18.936 --> 01:40:20.936
I'll try.

1549
01:40:21.271 --> 01:40:23.319
I know you'd agree with me about...

1550
01:40:23.419 --> 01:40:25.467
...the horrendous cost of health care.

1551
01:40:25.567 --> 01:40:27.261
Of course, of course.

1552
01:40:27.361 --> 01:40:29.100
We pride ourselves on our...

1553
01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:31.515
...enlightened policy regarding payment.

1554
01:40:31.615 --> 01:40:34.165
Thank you very much for your time.

1555
01:40:36.787 --> 01:40:39.176
We'll be happy to have you back...

1556
01:40:39.276 --> 01:40:42.126
...on any of our normal visiting days.

1557
01:40:45.337 --> 01:40:47.840
Curtis Morgan, oil and gas.

1558
01:40:58.934 --> 01:41:00.669
White & Blazevich, please.

1559
01:41:00.769 --> 01:41:03.094
Second floor.
Use the escalator.

1560
01:41:24.668 --> 01:41:25.778
May I help you?

1561
01:41:25.878 --> 01:41:28.653
Dorothy Blythe, to see Curtis Morgan.

1562
01:41:30.632 --> 01:41:31.483
Have a seat.

1563
01:41:31.509 --> 01:41:33.282
I'll be right with you.

1564
01:42:07.711 --> 01:42:10.091
You have a meeting with Mr Morgan?

1565
01:42:10.161 --> 01:42:11.448
Yes. At 5.

1566
01:42:11.548 --> 01:42:13.169
When was your appointment?

1567
01:42:13.269 --> 01:42:14.118
Two weeks ago.

1568
01:42:14.218 --> 01:42:15.994
May I ask why?

1569
01:42:16.094 --> 01:42:19.094
Obviously, I need an oil and gas lawyer.

1570
01:42:20.057 --> 01:42:22.057
Curtis Morgan is dead.

1571
01:42:24.186 --> 01:42:26.186
Why didn't anyone call me?

1572
01:42:26.188 --> 01:42:29.038
We have no record of your appointment.

1573
01:42:29.733 --> 01:42:31.343
What happened?

1574
01:42:31.443 --> 01:42:33.737
He was mugged a week ago.

1575
01:42:33.946 --> 01:42:36.306
Shot by street punks, we believe.

1576
01:42:36.406 --> 01:42:38.806
Do you have some identification?

1577
01:42:39.409 --> 01:42:40.811
He's Security.

1578
01:42:40.911 --> 01:42:42.911
Security for what?

1579
01:42:43.497 --> 01:42:44.341
Come with us,

1580
01:42:44.441 --> 01:42:46.316
you should see someone else.

1581
01:42:46.416 --> 01:42:49.465
After this treatment, I have no interest...

1582
01:42:49.565 --> 01:42:52.340
...in talking to anyone in this firm.

1583
01:43:07.938 --> 01:43:09.940
They killed him.

1584
01:43:18.031 --> 01:43:20.031
I can't breathe.

1585
01:43:35.966 --> 01:43:37.139
It's all right.

1586
01:43:37.165 --> 01:43:38.493
Just let it go.

1587
01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:40.760
Let it go.

1588
01:43:44.892 --> 01:43:46.892
It's all right.

1589
01:43:53.984 --> 01:43:55.862
We ran the story about a week ago.

1590
01:43:55.962 --> 01:43:57.387
It's just another mugging.

1591
01:43:57.487 --> 01:43:59.962
Didn't make the Metro front page.

1592
01:44:00.199 --> 01:44:01.725
Curtis Morgan...

1593
01:44:01.825 --> 01:44:04.328
...225 Willow Road, Bethesda.

1594
01:44:04.912 --> 01:44:07.289
225 Willow Road...

1595
01:44:07.831 --> 01:44:09.831
...Bethesda.

1596
01:44:09.833 --> 01:44:11.443
That's what I wanted.

1597
01:44:11.543 --> 01:44:13.818
Report in before noon tomorrow.

1598
01:44:13.918 --> 01:44:15.918
We're nervous over here.

1599
01:44:16.089 --> 01:44:17.574
You know...

1600
01:44:17.674 --> 01:44:19.849
...good help is hard to find.

1601
01:44:26.725 --> 01:44:28.725
I'm going with you.

1602
01:44:32.814 --> 01:44:34.814
Look at me.

1603
01:44:43.033 --> 01:44:45.033
I want you to leave.

1604
01:44:47.871 --> 01:44:50.041
And if you need confirmation...

1605
01:44:50.094 --> 01:44:51.442
...for your story?

1606
01:44:51.542 --> 01:44:53.542
I'm on my own.

1607
01:44:56.713 --> 01:44:58.715
What's changed your mind?

1608
01:45:02.553 --> 01:45:04.721
I want you to reach 25.

1609
01:45:11.353 --> 01:45:13.353
I'm coming.

1610
01:45:41.258 --> 01:45:42.826
Good evening.

1611
01:45:42.926 --> 01:45:44.359
I'm Grantham of the Herald.

1612
01:45:44.385 --> 01:45:45.604
This is my assistant.

1613
01:45:45.679 --> 01:45:47.494
Could we see Mrs Morgan?

1614
01:45:47.594 --> 01:45:48.700
I'm her father.

1615
01:45:48.726 --> 01:45:49.979
She won't talk.

1616
01:45:50.601 --> 01:45:52.158
I respect her privacy.

1617
01:45:52.258 --> 01:45:54.838
I know she's been through an ordeal.

1618
01:45:54.938 --> 01:45:56.443
When did you people...

1619
01:45:56.543 --> 01:45:58.884
...ever respect anyone's privacy?

1620
01:45:58.984 --> 01:46:01.709
I feel that way about most reporters.

1621
01:46:01.809 --> 01:46:03.909
But her husband called me...

1622
01:46:04.031 --> 01:46:06.031
...3 times before he died.

1623
01:46:06.450 --> 01:46:09.225
I believe his death wasn't accidental.

1624
01:46:10.621 --> 01:46:12.424
She doesn't want to talk.

1625
01:46:12.450 --> 01:46:14.396
Get the hell out of here.

1626
01:46:16.627 --> 01:46:18.627
You change your mind...

1627
01:46:19.046 --> 01:46:21.046
...I'll be at this number.

1628
01:47:29.241 --> 01:47:32.494
Mr Grantham?
Yes.

1629
01:47:33.203 --> 01:47:35.203
This is Mrs Morgan.

1630
01:47:36.707 --> 01:47:39.209
Do you still want to see me?

1631
01:47:42.045 --> 01:47:44.745
Did you know your husband called me?

1632
01:47:48.010 --> 01:47:49.551
No. How would he know...

1633
01:47:49.651 --> 01:47:51.789
...anything about those dead judges?

1634
01:47:51.889 --> 01:47:54.016
I have no idea.

1635
01:47:55.058 --> 01:47:57.058
Did he keep any...

1636
01:47:57.060 --> 01:47:59.104
...unusual documents...

1637
01:47:59.396 --> 01:48:01.396
...or papers?

1638
01:48:02.065 --> 01:48:04.375
We have a lock box at the bank...

1639
01:48:04.447 --> 01:48:06.447
...for deed and wills.

1640
01:48:06.904 --> 01:48:09.029
I looked at it last Thursday.

1641
01:48:09.129 --> 01:48:11.529
There was nothing unusual in it.

1642
01:48:12.743 --> 01:48:14.743
On Saturday morning...

1643
01:48:14.786 --> 01:48:16.961
...I was going through his...

1644
01:48:18.749 --> 01:48:20.834
...desk in the bedroom.

1645
01:48:22.044 --> 01:48:24.444
I found something a bit unusual.

1646
01:48:26.423 --> 01:48:28.423
A key.

1647
01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:31.760
A key to what?

1648
01:48:32.763 --> 01:48:34.763
Another lock box.

1649
01:48:36.433 --> 01:48:38.433
Which bank?

1650
01:48:39.102 --> 01:48:41.102
Riggs Bank.

1651
01:48:44.441 --> 01:48:46.441
We've never banked there.

1652
01:48:46.860 --> 01:48:49.785
And you knew nothing about this other...

1653
01:48:49.988 --> 01:48:51.140
...box?

1654
01:48:51.240 --> 01:48:53.265
Not until Saturday morning.

1655
01:48:53.575 --> 01:48:55.575
I figured...

1656
01:48:56.119 --> 01:48:58.819
...I'll run by when I felt up to it.

1657
01:48:59.790 --> 01:49:02.640
Maybe you should check it, Mrs Morgan.

1658
01:49:04.461 --> 01:49:07.011
Could be a clue to who killed him.

1659
01:49:07.965 --> 01:49:10.592
Are you saying Curtis was killed...

1660
01:49:10.801 --> 01:49:12.542
...because he knew something...

1661
01:49:12.642 --> 01:49:14.037
...about the a ssassinations?

1662
01:49:14.137 --> 01:49:16.462
That's exactly what I'm saying.

1663
01:49:17.307 --> 01:49:18.908
Do you think there...

1664
01:49:19.008 --> 01:49:22.233
...may be papers in the safe-deposit box...

1665
01:49:22.312 --> 01:49:24.718
...that may reveal what Curtis knew...

1666
01:49:24.818 --> 01:49:26.383
...about the a ssassinations?

1667
01:49:26.483 --> 01:49:28.483
There could be.

1668
01:49:31.029 --> 01:49:33.323
My child's lost one parent.

1669
01:49:37.494 --> 01:49:39.669
I can't let her lose another.

1670
01:49:41.999 --> 01:49:43.999
I'll check it for you.

1671
01:49:44.251 --> 01:49:46.951
No one has to know you have the key.

1672
01:49:50.924 --> 01:49:53.549
They will only give it to his wife.

1673
01:49:53.635 --> 01:49:55.133
My partner's a woman.

1674
01:49:55.159 --> 01:49:56.585
She's trustworthy.

1675
01:49:57.848 --> 01:49:59.583
I would have one condition.

1676
01:49:59.683 --> 01:50:02.273
If you find something that disparages...

1677
01:50:02.373 --> 01:50:04.963
...my husband in any way, you can't use it.

1678
01:50:05.063 --> 01:50:07.441
You have my word, Mrs Morgan.

1679
01:51:42.452 --> 01:51:44.354
Where are the safe-deposit boxes?

1680
01:51:44.454 --> 01:51:46.454
Down those steps.

1681
01:53:07.204 --> 01:53:09.374
I need access to a box, please.

1682
01:53:09.456 --> 01:53:11.542
The number, please?
- 616

1683
01:53:14.586 --> 01:53:17.490
This box was rented two weeks ago.

1684
01:53:17.590 --> 01:53:18.782
Yes.

1685
01:53:18.882 --> 01:53:20.882
I assume you're Mrs Morgan?

1686
01:53:20.886 --> 01:53:21.994
Sara Ann Morgan.

1687
01:53:22.094 --> 01:53:23.094
The address?

1688
01:53:23.194 --> 01:53:25.194
225 Willow Road, Bethesda.

1689
01:53:26.223 --> 01:53:29.768
Phone number?
- 7984

1690
01:53:30.561 --> 01:53:32.171
Who rented this box?

1691
01:53:32.271 --> 01:53:34.469
My husband, Curtis D. Morgan.

1692
01:53:34.569 --> 01:53:36.921
And his social security number?

1693
01:53:40.737 --> 01:53:43.156
510-96-8686.

1694
01:53:44.867 --> 01:53:46.892
Will you sign here, please?

1695
01:53:47.286 --> 01:53:48.479
May I help you?

1696
01:53:48.579 --> 01:53:50.579
I'd like to rent a box.

1697
01:53:50.747 --> 01:53:52.261
Will you have a seat?

1698
01:53:52.287 --> 01:53:54.522
I'll be with you in a minute.

1699
01:53:55.627 --> 01:53:56.820
You have a key?

1700
01:53:56.920 --> 01:53:58.920
Yes, I do.

1701
01:54:00.424 --> 01:54:02.424
Follow me.

1702
01:55:42.860 --> 01:55:45.035
It's a four-page affidavit...

1703
01:55:45.112 --> 01:55:47.698
...signed under oath.

1704
01:55:47.906 --> 01:55:51.806
It's dated the day before the last time he called me.

1705
01:55:53.871 --> 01:55:56.193
He worked at White & Blazevich...

1706
01:55:56.293 --> 01:55:59.443
...in the oil and gas section for 5 years.

1707
01:56:00.002 --> 01:56:01.278
Listen to this.

1708
01:56:01.378 --> 01:56:02.905
During that time...

1709
01:56:03.005 --> 01:56:05.102
...he worked for a client who...

1710
01:56:05.202 --> 01:56:07.701
...was engaged in a lawsuit in Louisiana.

1711
01:56:07.801 --> 01:56:11.101
The client was a man named Victor Mattiece...

1712
01:56:11.221 --> 01:56:12.956
...who he's never met.

1713
01:56:13.056 --> 01:56:14.567
Lots about the lawsuit,

1714
01:56:14.667 --> 01:56:17.187
how desperate Mattiece was to win it.

1715
01:56:17.227 --> 01:56:19.227
Just as if you wrote it.

1716
01:56:20.731 --> 01:56:23.734
A partner named Sims Wakefield...

1717
01:56:23.942 --> 01:56:26.028
...supervised the case for W & B.

1718
01:56:26.128 --> 01:56:28.472
Morgan worked on a peripherated case.

1719
01:56:28.572 --> 01:56:30.391
He took files and documents...

1720
01:56:30.491 --> 01:56:32.309
...that Wakefield left for him...

1721
01:56:32.409 --> 01:56:34.144
...not related to the case.

1722
01:56:34.244 --> 01:56:36.614
When he got back to his own office, he...

1723
01:56:36.714 --> 01:56:39.024
...found a memo on the bottom of the stack.

1724
01:56:39.124 --> 01:56:42.444
He'd inadvertently taken it from Wakefield's desk.

1725
01:56:42.544 --> 01:56:45.697
A copy of the memo is attached to the affidavit.

1726
01:56:45.797 --> 01:56:48.457
He copied the memo and left the memo...

1727
01:56:48.508 --> 01:56:50.369
...under the files on his desk.

1728
01:56:50.469 --> 01:56:52.763
Next stop, Washington Herald.

1729
01:56:55.432 --> 01:56:57.532
No. Stop.
Get out of the car.

02:00:12.129 --> 02:00:14.212
There was a car explosion...

1771
02:00:14.312 --> 02:00:16.158
...in a garage near the Riggs Bank.

1772
02:00:16.258 --> 02:00:19.633
The police traced the car to a leasing agency.

1773
02:00:20.095 --> 02:00:22.795
It was rented yesterday by Grantham.

1774
02:00:25.058 --> 02:00:27.233
Have you heard from Grantham?

1775
02:00:28.187 --> 02:00:30.187
Not since yesterday.

1776
02:00:31.982 --> 02:00:34.551
I should've taken him off that story.

1777
02:00:34.651 --> 02:00:36.651
What story?

1778
02:00:38.989 --> 02:00:40.989
See what you can find.

1779
02:01:02.095 --> 02:01:03.914
Smith Keen...

1780
02:01:04.014 --> 02:01:06.014
...meet Darby Shaw.

1781
02:01:07.768 --> 02:01:09.768
So, Mr Grantham...

1782
02:01:09.811 --> 02:01:11.986
...what the hell is going on?

1783
02:01:21.865 --> 02:01:24.940
Sweetheart, I'm down here in the basement.

1784
02:01:26.453 --> 02:01:28.703
It's about two in the morning.

1785
02:01:31.208 --> 02:01:33.208
This is...

1786
02:01:33.335 --> 02:01:35.335
...an affidavit...

1787
02:01:37.047 --> 02:01:39.972
...concerning a memo I found on my desk.

1788
02:01:41.176 --> 02:01:45.013
I'm going to trust you to do with it what you will.

1789
02:01:46.056 --> 02:01:49.506
The memo's from Velmano, he's a senior partner.

1790
02:01:52.271 --> 02:01:55.399
It was dated September 28th...

1791
02:01:56.733 --> 02:01:59.583
...addressed to Wakefield and it read:

1792
02:01:59.736 --> 02:02:02.811
'Sims, advise client research is complete.

1793
02:02:03.073 --> 02:02:05.383
The bench will sit much softer...

1794
02:02:05.472 --> 02:02:07.647
...if the old man is retired.

1795
02:02:07.744 --> 02:02:10.510
The second retirement is a bit unusual.

1796
02:02:10.610 --> 02:02:12.149
Jensen, of all people.

1797
02:02:12.249 --> 02:02:14.081
Advise further that the pelican...

1798
02:02:14.181 --> 02:02:15.903
...should arrive here in 4 years...

1799
02:02:16.003 --> 02:02:18.088
...assuming other factors.'

1800
02:02:19.047 --> 02:02:21.047
There's no signature.

1801
02:02:21.508 --> 02:02:23.858
Then Justices Rosenberg and Jensen...

1802
02:02:23.958 --> 02:02:25.958
...were killed.

1803
02:02:27.389 --> 02:02:29.000
I firmly believe that this is...

1804
02:02:29.100 --> 02:02:31.126
...the work of Mattiece and his associates.

1805
02:02:31.226 --> 02:02:32.754
Memo doesn't mention Mattiece,

1806
02:02:32.854 --> 02:02:34.171
but it refers to a client.

1807
02:02:34.271 --> 02:02:36.596
Wakefield had no other clients.

1808
02:02:36.815 --> 02:02:39.318
And no client had as much to gain...

1809
02:02:39.418 --> 02:02:41.418
...from the new court.

1810
02:02:41.778 --> 02:02:44.379
I thought that I was protecting us...

1811
02:02:44.479 --> 02:02:46.954
...by not revealing what I found.

1812
02:02:47.284 --> 02:02:49.709
You'll only see this if I'm gone,

1813
02:02:49.809 --> 02:02:51.809
so I will have failed.

1814
02:02:52.789 --> 02:02:54.789
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

1815
02:02:59.254 --> 02:03:01.254
I'll always be with you.

1816
02:03:03.342 --> 02:03:05.342
Always.

1817
02:03:07.638 --> 02:03:09.174
This is Marty Velmano.

1818
02:03:09.200 --> 02:03:10.456
What a pleasure.

1819
02:03:10.531 --> 02:03:12.084
What can I do for you?

1820
02:03:12.184 --> 02:03:15.409
We're doing a story about Victor Mattiece...

1821
02:03:15.979 --> 02:03:18.715
...and his involvement in the deaths...

1822
02:03:18.815 --> 02:03:20.509
...of Rosenberg and Jensen.

1823
02:03:20.609 --> 02:03:22.980
Great. We'll sue you for the next 20...

1824
02:03:23.080 --> 02:03:25.389
...years. You'll be named as a defendant.

1825
02:03:25.489 --> 02:03:27.574
Oh, this will be great.

1826
02:03:27.824 --> 02:03:30.524
Victor Mattiece will own the Herald.

1827
02:03:30.577 --> 02:03:33.227
Have you heard of the Pelican Brief?

1828
02:03:33.327 --> 02:03:35.065
We have a copy of it.

1829
02:03:35.165 --> 02:03:37.151
We also have a copy of a memo...

1830
02:03:37.251 --> 02:03:39.236
...sent by you to Sims Wakefield...

1831
02:03:39.336 --> 02:03:41.725
...in which you suggest your client's...

1832
02:03:41.825 --> 02:03:44.032
...position would be greatly improved...

1833
02:03:44.132 --> 02:03:46.442
...by the removal of Rosenberg...

1834
02:03:46.531 --> 02:03:48.579
...and Jensen from the court.

1835
02:03:48.679 --> 02:03:51.014
I noticed you waited till five.

1836
02:03:51.223 --> 02:03:53.126
An hour earlier, we could've...

1837
02:03:53.226 --> 02:03:54.877
...run to court, stopped this.

1838
02:03:54.977 --> 02:03:57.077
You deny you wrote the memo?

1839
02:04:00.315 --> 02:04:02.317
It's a fabrication.

1840
02:04:03.110 --> 02:04:05.510
You have no lawsuit, Mr Velmano.

1841
02:04:06.196 --> 02:04:07.806
You know it.

1842
02:04:07.906 --> 02:04:09.906
You son of a bitch.

1843
02:04:12.703 --> 02:04:14.396
Mr Coal?

1844
02:04:14.496 --> 02:04:16.524
Have you read the Pelican Brief?

1845
02:04:16.624 --> 02:04:17.816
I have.

1846
02:04:17.916 --> 02:04:20.264
We're running a story which verifies...

1847
02:04:20.364 --> 02:04:22.404
...the facts set forth in that brief.

1848
02:04:22.504 --> 02:04:24.027
We've confirmed Mattiece...

1849
02:04:24.127 --> 02:04:25.824
...contributed over $4 million...

1850
02:04:25.924 --> 02:04:28.077
...to the president's last campaign.

1851
02:04:28.177 --> 02:04:30.621
4,200,000, all through legal channels.

1852
02:04:30.721 --> 02:04:31.872
That's right.

1853
02:04:31.972 --> 02:04:34.114
We believe the White House tried...

1854
02:04:34.214 --> 02:04:36.418
...to obstruct the FBI investigation...

1855
02:04:36.518 --> 02:04:39.296
...and we wonder if there are any comments.

1856
02:04:39.396 --> 02:04:40.735
The White House denies...

1857
02:04:40.835 --> 02:04:42.841
...any direct or indirect involvement...

1858
02:04:42.941 --> 02:04:45.194
...in this investigation.

1859
02:04:45.903 --> 02:04:48.678
You've received some bad information.

1860
02:04:56.163 --> 02:04:58.290
Mr Voyles, it's Grantham.

1861
02:04:59.708 --> 02:05:02.569
We're running a story detailing a conspiracy...

1862
02:05:02.669 --> 02:05:05.114
...in the murders of Rosenberg and Jensen.

1863
02:05:05.214 --> 02:05:07.208
We're naming Mattiece, an oil...

1864
02:05:07.308 --> 02:05:09.493
...speculator, and two of his lawyers.

1865
02:05:09.593 --> 02:05:12.024
We believe the FBI knew about Mattiece,

1866
02:05:12.124 --> 02:05:13.664
but didn't investigate...

1867
02:05:13.764 --> 02:05:16.339
...at the urging of the White House.

1868
02:05:16.439 --> 02:05:18.439
Any comments?

1869
02:06:29.464 --> 02:06:32.743
I think we'll have great success with these people.

1870
02:06:32.843 --> 02:06:35.512
They were really very pleased...

1871
02:06:35.846 --> 02:06:38.182
...and genuinely cooperative.

1872
02:06:38.765 --> 02:06:40.765
What's up?

1873
02:07:24.102 --> 02:07:26.102
You know Gray Grantham.

1874
02:07:27.606 --> 02:07:29.606
And this is Darby Shaw.

1875
02:07:37.616 --> 02:07:39.616
So you're the little lady...

1876
02:07:39.661 --> 02:07:42.286
...who started this great brouhaha.

1877
02:07:42.371 --> 02:07:44.541
I think you have me confused...

1878
02:07:44.628 --> 02:07:46.798
...with the president's friend.

1879
02:07:46.834 --> 02:07:50.420
I have some comments, for the record.

1880
02:07:59.388 --> 02:08:01.312
First, we got the Pelican Brief...

1881
02:08:01.412 --> 02:08:02.291
...two weeks ago...

1882
02:08:02.391 --> 02:08:04.277
...and submitted it to the White House...

1883
02:08:04.377 --> 02:08:05.377
...on the same day.

1884
02:08:05.477 --> 02:08:08.036
It was not considered high priority in...

1885
02:08:08.136 --> 02:08:10.632
...the investigation until Gavin Verheek...

1886
02:08:10.732 --> 02:08:12.726
...Special Counsel to the Director,

1887
02:08:12.826 --> 02:08:13.886
was found murdered.

1888
02:08:13.986 --> 02:08:16.036
Did the White House interfere...

1889
02:08:16.136 --> 02:08:18.515
...in the FBI investigation of Mattiece?

1890
02:08:18.615 --> 02:08:20.615
I'll discuss it...

1891
02:08:20.617 --> 02:08:22.617
...off the record.

1892
02:08:29.793 --> 02:08:32.205
Last Wednesday the president asked me...

1893
02:08:32.305 --> 02:08:34.656
...to ignore Victor Mattiece as a suspect.

1894
02:08:34.756 --> 02:08:36.756
In his words...

1895
02:08:36.925 --> 02:08:39.100
...he asked me to 'back off.'

1896
02:08:39.678 --> 02:08:41.678
I have a tape...

1897
02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:44.340
...which I will allow no one to hear...

1898
02:08:44.391 --> 02:08:47.466
...unless the president first denies this.

1899
02:08:48.145 --> 02:08:50.145
So what do you do now?

1900
02:08:50.898 --> 02:08:52.998
There'll be a grand jury by...

1901
02:08:53.091 --> 02:08:55.791
...noon tomorrow.
Quick indictments.

1902
02:08:56.278 --> 02:08:58.447
And we'll find Mattiece.

1903
02:09:00.824 --> 02:09:03.899
I'd like a few minutes alone with Ms Shaw.

1904
02:09:04.494 --> 02:09:06.396
If she doesn't mind.
It's her call.

1905
02:09:06.496 --> 02:09:08.671
I'd like Mr Grantham to stay.

1906
02:09:29.186 --> 02:09:31.186
What's next for you?

1907
02:09:31.813 --> 02:09:34.425
Who killed the man disguised as Verheek?

1908
02:09:34.525 --> 02:09:37.319
Oh, you mean the assassin, Khamel.

1909
02:09:38.195 --> 02:09:40.000
Off the record, Khamel was killed...

1910
02:09:40.100 --> 02:09:41.390
...by a contract operative...

1911
02:09:41.490 --> 02:09:44.040
...hired independently by the CIA.

1912
02:09:44.535 --> 02:09:45.769
Rupert?

1913
02:09:45.869 --> 02:09:47.646
He probably has 20 names.

1914
02:09:47.746 --> 02:09:49.746
Why was he following her?

1915
02:09:50.207 --> 02:09:52.036
I think the brief initially...

1916
02:09:52.136 --> 02:09:54.153
...scared Giminski more than anyone.

1917
02:09:54.253 --> 02:09:55.946
And he probably...

1918
02:09:56.046 --> 02:09:57.197
...sent Rupert...

1919
02:09:57.297 --> 02:09:59.297
...to trail Darby...

1920
02:09:59.508 --> 02:10:02.733
...in part to watch, and in part to protect.

1921
02:10:05.764 --> 02:10:09.226
We can help. What do you want?

1922
02:10:11.687 --> 02:10:13.787
To leave the country, alone.

1923
02:10:16.733 --> 02:10:18.302
All right.

1924
02:10:18.402 --> 02:10:21.513
We'll get you out of here, put you on my plane.

1925
02:10:21.613 --> 02:10:23.250
We'll fly you anywhere you want...

1926
02:10:23.350 --> 02:10:24.391
...and you can disappear.

1927
02:10:24.491 --> 02:10:27.416
But you must allow me to contact you...

1928
02:10:27.619 --> 02:10:29.104
...through Mr Grantham...

1929
02:10:29.204 --> 02:10:30.579
...if, and only if,

1930
02:10:30.679 --> 02:10:32.929
it becomes urgently necessary.

1931
02:10:34.918 --> 02:10:36.918
That's fine.

1932
02:10:38.922 --> 02:10:41.422
I want no one on the plane but me,

1933
02:10:41.522 --> 02:10:43.410
Gray and the pilots.

1934
02:10:43.510 --> 02:10:45.522
After take-off, I'll tell the pilot...

1935
02:10:45.622 --> 02:10:46.622
...where to go.

1936
02:10:46.722 --> 02:10:50.322
He has to file a flight plan before he can leave.

1937
02:10:50.642 --> 02:10:53.061
You're the director of the FBI.

1938
02:10:54.104 --> 02:10:56.104
Set it up.

1939
02:14:51.466 --> 02:14:53.660
Our guest today is Gray Grantham...

1940
02:14:53.760 --> 02:14:55.821
...who has, as just about everyone...

1941
02:14:55.921 --> 02:14:56.955
...in America knows...

1942
02:14:57.055 --> 02:14:59.435
...revealed the plot behind the...

1943
02:14:59.487 --> 02:15:02.169
...assassinations of Rosenberg and Jensen.

1944
02:15:02.269 --> 02:15:04.486
The ripple effects of this story...

1945
02:15:04.586 --> 02:15:06.090
...just don't seem to stop.

1946
02:15:06.190 --> 02:15:08.346
As of this broadcast, Victor Mattiece,

1947
02:15:08.446 --> 02:15:10.427
one of the country's richest men...

1948
02:15:10.527 --> 02:15:12.907
...has been indicted, along with...

1949
02:15:12.982 --> 02:15:14.306
...4 aides and lawyers.

1950
02:15:14.406 --> 02:15:17.066
Fletcher Coal, the president's Chief...

1951
02:15:17.148 --> 02:15:18.685
...of Staff, has resigned.

1952
02:15:18.785 --> 02:15:20.855
And we're getting strong indications...

1953
02:15:20.955 --> 02:15:22.481
...that the president himself...

1954
02:15:22.581 --> 02:15:24.581
...will not run again.

1955
02:15:24.708 --> 02:15:26.147
That's what we know.

1956
02:15:26.173 --> 02:15:28.258
Let's get to what we don't.

1957
02:15:28.921 --> 02:15:31.388
We know the Pelican Brief was written...

1958
02:15:31.488 --> 02:15:33.325
...by a woman named Darby Shaw...

1959
02:15:33.425 --> 02:15:35.900
...but we don't know who that is.

1960
02:15:35.928 --> 02:15:37.930
Who is Darby Shaw?

1961
02:15:40.390 --> 02:15:43.018
That's a question for Darby Shaw.

1962
02:15:43.227 --> 02:15:44.423
Next question.

1963
02:15:44.523 --> 02:15:47.856
Speaking for many of our colleagues...

1964
02:15:48.190 --> 02:15:50.150
...who are in a feeding frenzy to...

1965
02:15:50.250 --> 02:15:51.093
...interview her...

1966
02:15:51.193 --> 02:15:53.193
...where is Darby Shaw?

1967
02:15:53.237 --> 02:15:55.876
That's also a question for Darby Shaw.

1968
02:15:55.976 --> 02:15:57.766
But she's not available...

1969
02:15:57.866 --> 02:15:59.280
...to answer questions...

1970
02:15:59.380 --> 02:16:01.145
...until the feeding frenzy stops.

1971
02:16:01.245 --> 02:16:02.385
Does that mean...

1972
02:16:02.485 --> 02:16:04.810
...you don't know where she is?

1973
02:16:05.332 --> 02:16:06.734
I didn't say that.

1974
02:16:06.834 --> 02:16:08.834
Then you do know.

1975
02:16:12.339 --> 02:16:14.742
I take it this cryptic smile means...

1976
02:16:14.842 --> 02:16:16.842
...you're not answering.

1977
02:16:18.762 --> 02:16:22.057
In view of all this, you know that...

1978
02:16:22.850 --> 02:16:24.376
...there's speculation...

1979
02:16:24.476 --> 02:16:26.856
...that this woman is a figment...

1980
02:16:26.934 --> 02:16:28.297
...of your imagination.

1981
02:16:28.397 --> 02:16:29.978
That you created her...

1982
02:16:30.078 --> 02:16:32.703
...from a lot of different sources.

1983
02:16:33.068 --> 02:16:35.054
Just as there are people who believe...

1984
02:16:35.154 --> 02:16:36.513
...there was no Deep Throat...

1985
02:16:36.613 --> 02:16:38.569
...there are those who believe...

1986
02:16:38.669 --> 02:16:40.017
...there is no Darby Shaw.

1987
02:16:40.117 --> 02:16:41.209
In other words,

1988
02:16:41.309 --> 02:16:43.634
she's just too good to be true.

1989
02:16:44.872 --> 02:16:46.872
She almost is.
