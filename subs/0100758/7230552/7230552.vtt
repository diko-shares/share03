00:01:11.524 --> 00:01:15.320
Much more than
just a series of small, isolated incidents...

2
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.686
...it's now apparent that an organized
criminal element is at work.

3
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.568
And at the moment, business is good.

4
00:01:22.732 --> 00:01:25.819
So good, in fact,
that there appear to be no eyewitnesses...

5
00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.777
...to any of these crimes.

6
00:01:27.942 --> 00:01:30.315
With complaints ranging
from purse-snatching...

7
00:01:30.485 --> 00:01:31.983
...to breaking and entering...

8
00:01:32.163 --> 00:01:34.276
...police switchboards
have been swamped...

9
00:01:34.441 --> 00:01:37.068
...with the angry voices
of more and more citizens...

10
00:01:37.233 --> 00:01:40.320
...who have fallen prey
to the recent surge of crime...

11
00:01:40.485 --> 00:01:42.193
...that continues to plague the city.

12
00:01:57.443 --> 00:02:02.318
Instead of getting better,
things have actually gotten worse.

13
00:02:02.483 --> 00:02:04.940
Even more alarming is the baffling...

14
00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.736
...and often bizarre nature
of these crimes.

15
00:02:09.651 --> 00:02:12.318
Merchandise
of every size and description...

16
00:02:12.483 --> 00:02:14.691
...from skateboards to stereo systems...

17
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.817
...has been disappearing
from store shelves and storage areas...

18
00:02:18.017 --> 00:02:20.485
...at an alarming rate.

19
00:02:20.943 --> 00:02:22.734
Aah...

20
00:02:23.486 --> 00:02:27.318
Even the victims themselves
rarely catch a glimpse of the thieves.

21
00:02:27.486 --> 00:02:31.817
Many don't even know
they've been victimized until it's too late.

22
00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:36.693
In fact, police have yet to come up
with a single eyewitness.

23
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.568
Only a few vague reports...

24
00:02:38.735 --> 00:02:42.651
...of young boys or teenagers
at the scenes have been filed.

25
00:02:42.818 --> 00:02:46.901
But whoever is behind these crimes,
one thing is certain.

26
00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:52.651
These are much more than just a series
of random isolated incidents.

27
00:02:55.985 --> 00:02:58.276
Come on. Hurry up.

28
00:03:07.902 --> 00:03:09.401
Mm.

29
00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:10.984
Good.

30
00:03:16.902 --> 00:03:18.610
Crimes without criminals?

31
00:03:18.777 --> 00:03:20.485
An invisible gang at work?

32
00:03:20.652 --> 00:03:22.151
Who are we gonna call?

33
00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.485
Unfortunately,
the police are the only ones available...

34
00:03:25.652 --> 00:03:30.234
...to combat what some are already dubbing
"the silent crime wave."

35
00:03:30.402 --> 00:03:32.984
But perhaps the most
disturbing silence...

36
00:03:33.152 --> 00:03:35.651
...is that coming from city hall.

37
00:03:35.818 --> 00:03:39.318
April O'Neil,
Channel 3 Eyewitness News.

38
00:03:40.027 --> 00:03:41.693
You gotta stop working so hard, April.

39
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.568
What, and give up
all this glamour? Ha-ha-ha.

40
00:03:44.735 --> 00:03:47.651
- Good night.
- Good night.

41
00:04:23.902 --> 00:04:25.817
Bad timing.

42
00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:27.693
You're telling me.

43
00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.901
- Get her purse. Hey, get her purse.
- Get away from me!

44
00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:33.318
- What do you think... Help!
- Get herjewelry.

45
00:04:33.486 --> 00:04:35.318
- Hurry up.
- Get the money. I got her watch.

46
00:04:45.486 --> 00:04:47.401
Whoa.

47
00:04:54.235 --> 00:04:56.610
What the hell's going on?
Thought I'd seen it all.

48
00:04:57.818 --> 00:04:59.151
Ready.

49
00:05:00.486 --> 00:05:03.193
All right. You tough guys.

50
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.318
Roll over here. How did you
get yourself into this, huh, kid?

51
00:05:06.486 --> 00:05:08.318
- You all right, ma'am?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

52
00:05:08.486 --> 00:05:11.651
Listen, rest right here
while we deal with these guys.

53
00:05:18.694 --> 00:05:20.942
- Ted, give John a hand.
- What you got there?

54
00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:23.318
Oh, man.

55
00:05:24.194 --> 00:05:26.485
Come on, no fighting.

56
00:05:26.652 --> 00:05:28.651
- Untie me.
- Let's get them in the car.

57
00:05:28.818 --> 00:05:30.568
Damn.

58
00:05:56.527 --> 00:05:57.817
Spectacular.

59
00:05:57.985 --> 00:06:01.193
- We were awesome, bros.
- Far out. Ow!

60
00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.734
Yes, dudes and dudettes...

61
00:06:02.902 --> 00:06:05.318
...major league butt-kicking
is back in town.

62
00:06:05.486 --> 00:06:06.485
Oh, yeah.

63
00:06:11.985 --> 00:06:13.359
Awesome.

64
00:06:13.527 --> 00:06:15.734
Ha-ha-ha. Righteous.

65
00:06:15.902 --> 00:06:17.193
Bossa nova!

66
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.193
- What?
- Huh?

67
00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.276
Bossa nova?

68
00:06:21.444 --> 00:06:23.485
- Chevy Nova?
- Oh.

69
00:06:26.027 --> 00:06:27.151
Excellent.

70
00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:29.859
- Yeah.
- All right.

71
00:06:30.027 --> 00:06:32.859
- Come on, let's move it. I'm starving.
- Ooh.

72
00:06:33.027 --> 00:06:36.276
Ooh. We're talking
major pizza attack here, dudes.

73
00:06:36.444 --> 00:06:38.485
Pizza. I need it.

74
00:06:38.652 --> 00:06:39.984
Oh, baby.

75
00:06:40.152 --> 00:06:41.568
Oh, man.

76
00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:43.401
All right.

77
00:06:44.985 --> 00:06:46.817
- Evening, bros.
- Whoo!

78
00:06:46.985 --> 00:06:48.817
- Give me three.
- You got it.

79
00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.068
We were great. I can't believe it.

80
00:06:57.444 --> 00:06:59.109
Damn!

81
00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:04.817
All right. Shh, shh.

82
00:07:04.985 --> 00:07:07.151
Ha-ha.

83
00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:10.526
We have had our first battle,
Master Splinter.

84
00:07:10.694 --> 00:07:12.942
They were many, but we kicked...

85
00:07:14.694 --> 00:07:16.901
- We fought well.
- Mm-hm.

86
00:07:17.444 --> 00:07:19.901
- Were you seen?
- Mm-mm.

87
00:07:20.444 --> 00:07:24.109
In this you must never lapse.

88
00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:29.859
Even those who would be our allies
would not understand.

89
00:07:30.027 --> 00:07:33.109
Our domain is the shadow.

90
00:07:33.277 --> 00:07:35.485
Stray from it reluctantly.

91
00:07:35.652 --> 00:07:37.026
For when you do...

92
00:07:37.194 --> 00:07:41.651
...you must strike hard and fade away...

93
00:07:42.402 --> 00:07:44.942
...without a trace.

94
00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:47.651
I lost a sai.

95
00:07:47.818 --> 00:07:50.276
- Then it is gone.
- But I can get it back. I can.

96
00:07:50.444 --> 00:07:53.485
Raphael, let it go.

97
00:07:55.194 --> 00:07:56.651
Hey.

98
00:07:59.902 --> 00:08:04.109
Your ninja skills are reaching their peak.

99
00:08:04.277 --> 00:08:10.817
Only one truly important lesson remains,
but must wait.

100
00:08:11.235 --> 00:08:15.651
I know it is hard for you
here underground.

101
00:08:15.818 --> 00:08:18.443
I want a large thick crust
with double cheese...

102
00:08:18.611 --> 00:08:19.984
...ham, pepperoni.

103
00:08:20.319 --> 00:08:23.984
Your teenage minds are broad, eager.

104
00:08:24.152 --> 00:08:28.942
But you must never stop practicing
the art of ninja...

105
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:33.068
...the art of invisibility.

106
00:08:33.235 --> 00:08:34.651
Oh, but no anchovies.

107
00:08:34.818 --> 00:08:36.817
And I mean no anchovies.

108
00:08:36.985 --> 00:08:40.610
You put anchovies on this thing
and you're in big trouble, okay?

109
00:08:40.777 --> 00:08:41.817
Michaelangelo!

110
00:08:41.985 --> 00:08:44.401
That'll do. And the clock's ticking, dude.

111
00:08:49.027 --> 00:08:51.443
You are still young...

112
00:08:51.611 --> 00:08:55.942
...but one day, I will be gone.

113
00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:59.443
Use my teachings wisely.

114
00:09:00.319 --> 00:09:03.359
I suggest we all meditate now...

115
00:09:03.527 --> 00:09:06.109
...on the events of this evening.

116
00:09:15.652 --> 00:09:17.276
Yeah.

117
00:09:18.152 --> 00:09:22.693
Yeah.

118
00:09:23.486 --> 00:09:25.734
Ninjitsu.

119
00:09:26.319 --> 00:09:27.901
Well, this is like meditating.

120
00:09:31.069 --> 00:09:33.401
Hey, Raph, where you going?

121
00:09:33.569 --> 00:09:35.734
Out to a movie.

122
00:09:36.818 --> 00:09:38.651
That okay with you?

123
00:09:38.818 --> 00:09:40.485
Yeah.

124
00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.817
Sock it to me, baby.

125
00:10:07.152 --> 00:10:09.984
- How you doing?
- Fine.

126
00:10:11.985 --> 00:10:13.318
Nice night.

127
00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:15.359
Mm-hm.

128
00:10:15.527 --> 00:10:17.859
Pizza dude's got 30 seconds.

129
00:10:18.027 --> 00:10:19.693
Mm-hm.

130
00:10:21.319 --> 00:10:25.401
Hey, Mikey, did you ever think
about what Splinter said tonight?

131
00:10:25.569 --> 00:10:28.109
I mean, about what it would be like...

132
00:10:28.277 --> 00:10:31.401
...you know, not having him?

133
00:10:31.611 --> 00:10:33.276
Hmm.

134
00:10:33.777 --> 00:10:37.734
- Time's up. Three bucks off.
- Mm.

135
00:10:42.402 --> 00:10:44.234
Okay.

136
00:10:50.027 --> 00:10:54.401
Now, 122, 122 and an eighth?

137
00:10:54.985 --> 00:10:59.318
122 and an eighth. Terrific.

138
00:10:59.486 --> 00:11:02.109
Where the heck is 122 and an eighth?

139
00:11:02.277 --> 00:11:04.817
You're standing on it, dude.

140
00:11:05.569 --> 00:11:07.942
Just slip it down here.

141
00:11:15.486 --> 00:11:16.651
Give me that.

142
00:11:18.027 --> 00:11:21.610
Hey, this is a 10. The tab's 13.

143
00:11:21.777 --> 00:11:23.485
You're two minutes late, dude.

144
00:11:23.652 --> 00:11:26.109
Oh, come on. I couldn't find the place.

145
00:11:26.277 --> 00:11:28.859
Wise man say, "Forgiveness is divine...

146
00:11:29.027 --> 00:11:32.610
...but never pay full price for late pizza."

147
00:11:33.152 --> 00:11:37.109
I gotta get a new route.
And I thought I delivered everywhere.

148
00:11:37.277 --> 00:11:40.610
Yes, friends, the new Turbo Ginsu.

149
00:11:40.777 --> 00:11:42.485
It dices, it slices...

150
00:11:42.652 --> 00:11:46.151
...and yet makes French fries
in three different...

151
00:11:46.319 --> 00:11:47.693
Whoops!

152
00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:49.318
Mm. Kids.

153
00:11:51.818 --> 00:11:53.401
Hmm.

154
00:11:55.486 --> 00:11:58.193
- There's a joke on the...
- I know.

155
00:12:01.902 --> 00:12:03.151
Ugh.

156
00:12:03.319 --> 00:12:05.776
Where do they come up with this stuff?

157
00:12:14.235 --> 00:12:16.651
- Hey.
- Hey.

158
00:12:16.818 --> 00:12:18.734
- Come back here.
- Somebody stop them.

159
00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.610
- Where's the...?
- What?

160
00:12:23.777 --> 00:12:24.942
- Huh?
- Huh.

161
00:12:26.152 --> 00:12:27.817
Mm-mm.

162
00:12:28.943 --> 00:12:30.151
Whoa.

163
00:12:36.902 --> 00:12:38.443
What the hell was that?

164
00:12:38.611 --> 00:12:39.776
I don't know.

165
00:12:40.486 --> 00:12:43.984
Now, that was a crime,
you purse-grabbing pukes...

166
00:12:44.152 --> 00:12:46.234
...and this is the penalty.

167
00:12:47.818 --> 00:12:51.151
Two minutes for slashing,
two minutes for hooking...

168
00:12:51.319 --> 00:12:53.859
...and let's not forget
my personal favorite...

169
00:12:54.027 --> 00:12:56.568
...two minutes for high-sticking.
Aah!

170
00:12:57.777 --> 00:13:01.318
How about a five-minute game misconduct
for roughing, pal?

171
00:13:01.486 --> 00:13:04.568
Hey, Bogie,
now, who died and made you referee?

172
00:13:04.735 --> 00:13:06.526
You did yourjob, now let me do mine.

173
00:13:06.694 --> 00:13:08.234
These JV lowlifes need a lesson.

174
00:13:08.527 --> 00:13:09.984
Not like that they don't.

175
00:13:10.152 --> 00:13:12.068
Not from you.

176
00:13:15.319 --> 00:13:19.151
Well, it looks like you're the one
who needs to be taught a lesson, pal.

177
00:13:19.402 --> 00:13:23.151
Class is Pain 101.
Your instructor is Casey Jones.

178
00:13:23.486 --> 00:13:25.984
Look, I don't wanna fight you.

179
00:13:26.152 --> 00:13:27.817
Well, tough rocks, pal.

180
00:13:30.818 --> 00:13:33.026
A Jose Canseco bat?

181
00:13:33.194 --> 00:13:36.443
- Tell me you didn't pay money for this.
- Ooh.

182
00:13:36.611 --> 00:13:38.151
That's it.

183
00:13:39.069 --> 00:13:40.485
Was a two-for-one sale, pal.

184
00:13:43.402 --> 00:13:45.901
- Hey, what are you, some sort of punker?
- Huh?

185
00:13:46.902 --> 00:13:49.068
God, I hate punkers.

186
00:13:49.527 --> 00:13:52.026
Especially bald ones
with green makeup...

187
00:13:52.194 --> 00:13:54.984
...who wear masks over ugly faces.
- That's it.

188
00:13:55.152 --> 00:13:57.151
- Ooh.
- New batter.

189
00:13:57.319 --> 00:13:58.942
Strike one.

190
00:13:59.235 --> 00:14:00.817
Whoa. Whiffer.

191
00:14:03.611 --> 00:14:05.651
- Ooh. Uhn!
- Home run.

192
00:14:07.235 --> 00:14:08.817
Raphael wins.

193
00:14:08.985 --> 00:14:11.485
One-nothing!

194
00:14:15.818 --> 00:14:16.942
Well?

195
00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:18.942
New game, roundhead.

196
00:14:21.444 --> 00:14:23.734
- Cricket.
- Cricket?

197
00:14:23.902 --> 00:14:25.776
Nobody understands cricket.

198
00:14:25.943 --> 00:14:28.651
You gotta know what a crumpet is
to understand cricket.

199
00:14:29.152 --> 00:14:30.651
I'll teach you.

200
00:14:32.985 --> 00:14:36.485
- Ooh...
- See? Six runs.

201
00:14:42.818 --> 00:14:44.651
So long, freak. I got work to do.

202
00:14:44.818 --> 00:14:46.817
Freak?

203
00:14:47.569 --> 00:14:49.443
Freak!

204
00:14:56.027 --> 00:14:57.234
What the heck was that?

205
00:14:57.402 --> 00:15:00.984
Looked like sort of a big turtle
in a trench coat.

206
00:15:01.319 --> 00:15:03.443
You're going to LaGuardia, right?

207
00:15:03.611 --> 00:15:04.859
Come back here.

208
00:15:05.027 --> 00:15:06.276
I'm not finished with you.

209
00:15:07.319 --> 00:15:09.693
Damn!

210
00:15:21.735 --> 00:15:23.485
Raphael.

211
00:15:23.652 --> 00:15:25.318
Come sit by me.

212
00:15:25.777 --> 00:15:27.234
Couldrt this wait till morning?

213
00:15:27.402 --> 00:15:30.234
You will listen now.

214
00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:44.485
My master Yoshi's first rule...

215
00:15:45.569 --> 00:15:48.151
...was possess the right thinking.

216
00:15:48.319 --> 00:15:51.485
Only then can one receive...

217
00:15:51.652 --> 00:15:56.817
...the gifts of strength,
knowledge and peace.

218
00:16:00.319 --> 00:16:04.651
I have tried to channel your anger,
Raphael...

219
00:16:04.818 --> 00:16:07.234
...but more remains.

220
00:16:07.402 --> 00:16:10.651
Anger clouds the mind.

221
00:16:10.818 --> 00:16:16.151
Turned inward,
it is an unconquerable enemy.

222
00:16:16.402 --> 00:16:20.485
You are unique among your brothers...

223
00:16:20.652 --> 00:16:25.651
...for you choose
to face this enemy alone.

224
00:16:25.818 --> 00:16:31.276
But as you face it, do not forget them.

225
00:16:31.444 --> 00:16:34.776
And do not forget me.

226
00:16:36.569 --> 00:16:42.318
I am here, my son.

227
00:16:43.319 --> 00:16:46.318
Come on, April, you could've
called me last night, you know?

228
00:16:46.486 --> 00:16:50.485
Call it a quirk, but I like to know when one
of my best reporters has been mugged.

229
00:16:50.652 --> 00:16:52.485
I wasn't mugged, Charles.

230
00:16:52.652 --> 00:16:57.026
Besides, I knew you'd just worry and then
rush over here like you did this morning.

231
00:16:57.194 --> 00:16:59.193
From now on,
security is gonna escort you...

232
00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:02.318
...to that Stone-Age van of yours
every night.

233
00:17:02.486 --> 00:17:04.526
- Yes, sir.
- I'm not kidding, April.

234
00:17:04.694 --> 00:17:07.485
Ugh. Hey, Danny, how's school going?

235
00:17:07.652 --> 00:17:09.485
- Fine.
- Oh, wonderful.

236
00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:13.193
So wonderful I have to drive him there
every morning now...

237
00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.526
...just to make sure he goes.

238
00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:17.693
See?

239
00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:20.068
That's what he does
when he wants to ignore me.

240
00:17:20.235 --> 00:17:21.651
Sticks his head in those things.

241
00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:26.651
I wonder where the hell
he got those things, anyway.

242
00:17:26.818 --> 00:17:29.151
Charles, give the kid a break.

243
00:17:31.444 --> 00:17:33.651
Just what is going on out there, April?

244
00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:36.901
I've never seen anything like this before.

245
00:17:37.652 --> 00:17:39.151
Like the city's falling apart.

246
00:17:39.319 --> 00:17:42.234
It's getting so you can't step outside
in the daytime anymore.

247
00:17:42.818 --> 00:17:44.276
Well, I'll tell you one thing.

248
00:17:44.444 --> 00:17:46.776
After everything I've heard
out of Little Tokyo...

249
00:17:46.943 --> 00:17:49.734
...Sterns is gonna have some answering
to do this afternoon.

250
00:17:49.902 --> 00:17:53.026
Look. Just take it easy, okay?

251
00:17:53.194 --> 00:17:55.651
He's already got the mayor
breathing down my neck.

252
00:17:55.985 --> 00:17:58.776
We are presently executing a plan
of redeployment...

253
00:17:58.943 --> 00:18:00.693
...that will minimize response time...

254
00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:04.276
...while maximizing coordination
between patrol units...

255
00:18:04.444 --> 00:18:07.817
...in a decentralized networking scheme.

256
00:18:09.444 --> 00:18:13.026
Huh. I'm not sure I understood all that,
Chief Sterns.

257
00:18:13.194 --> 00:18:14.610
Would you mind repeating it...

258
00:18:14.777 --> 00:18:17.359
...in English, perhaps?

259
00:18:18.027 --> 00:18:22.485
What that means, Miss O'Neil,
is that we have everything well in hand.

260
00:18:22.652 --> 00:18:25.193
- You know why crimes have been escalating.
- Guys, look.

261
00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:28.734
- That's her.
- No, I didn't say that either. Miss O'Neil...

262
00:18:28.902 --> 00:18:33.109
...if you would stick to asking questions,
there would be a lot...

263
00:18:33.277 --> 00:18:36.651
- Mmm. I'm in love.
- What do you know about an organization...

264
00:18:36.818 --> 00:18:39.276
...known as The Foot Clan?

265
00:18:39.527 --> 00:18:42.318
There is no evidence
to link such a name to these incidents.

266
00:18:42.486 --> 00:18:46.234
Are you denying that such an organization
known as The Foot exists?

267
00:18:46.652 --> 00:18:48.234
I'm not denying anything.

268
00:18:48.402 --> 00:18:51.568
Again, you're putting words
into my mouth.

269
00:18:51.735 --> 00:18:54.693
- Find her.
- It often seems that somebody ought to.

270
00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:57.234
- Silence her.
- Miss O'Neil...

271
00:18:57.402 --> 00:19:00.610
- She's great.
- An understatement as usual.

272
00:19:00.777 --> 00:19:02.776
- You're telling me.
- The girl is a fox.

273
00:19:02.943 --> 00:19:06.234
Look at the local weather
for this vicinity as it stands at this hour.

274
00:19:06.402 --> 00:19:09.817
O'Neil, get in here.

275
00:19:10.985 --> 00:19:12.734
Time me.

276
00:19:19.319 --> 00:19:23.109
Just what is it you hoped to accomplish
out there besides busting my chops?

277
00:19:24.735 --> 00:19:27.817
I think you know just as much as I do
about this Foot Clan...

278
00:19:27.985 --> 00:19:30.401
...and I don't think
you're doing anything about it.

279
00:19:30.569 --> 00:19:32.234
You expect me to waste manpower...

280
00:19:32.611 --> 00:19:34.610
...because a few immigrants
are reminded...

281
00:19:34.777 --> 00:19:37.734
...of something that supposedly happened
years ago in Japan?

282
00:19:37.902 --> 00:19:39.276
Have you got something else?

283
00:19:40.569 --> 00:19:43.443
Are you trying to tell me
how to do my job?

284
00:19:45.569 --> 00:19:48.443
One-oh-seven, a new record.

285
00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:11.109
Oh, great.

286
00:20:11.277 --> 00:20:12.610
Just great.

287
00:20:23.652 --> 00:20:26.068
We've been waiting for you, Miss O'Neil.

288
00:20:26.818 --> 00:20:28.151
What?

289
00:20:28.319 --> 00:20:31.026
Am I behind
on my Sony payments again? Ha-ha-ha.

290
00:20:31.194 --> 00:20:35.193
Your mouth may yet bring you
much trouble, Miss O'Neil.

291
00:20:35.402 --> 00:20:36.776
I deliver a message.

292
00:20:39.943 --> 00:20:42.276
- Hah!
- Shut it.

293
00:20:46.985 --> 00:20:48.984
All right. That's it.

294
00:21:50.735 --> 00:21:52.443
Are you crazy?

295
00:21:53.569 --> 00:21:56.193
Yeah, Leo, I'm crazy. Okay?

296
00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:57.859
A loony. Okay?

297
00:21:58.027 --> 00:21:59.068
Why?

298
00:21:59.235 --> 00:22:01.984
Why? Why? Oh, I don't know.

299
00:22:02.152 --> 00:22:03.693
Because I wanted to redecorate.

300
00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:06.942
You know, a couple of throw pillows,
a TV news reporter.

301
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:08.610
- What do you think?
- Ahem.

302
00:22:08.777 --> 00:22:10.942
Raphael, what are you doing?

303
00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:13.901
She got jumped in the subway.
I had to bring her here.

304
00:22:14.069 --> 00:22:15.984
It's the newslady.

305
00:22:16.943 --> 00:22:18.109
Can we keep her?

306
00:22:19.611 --> 00:22:22.901
- Bring water, cold washcloth, pillow.
- Far out.

307
00:22:34.277 --> 00:22:35.859
Oh...

308
00:22:41.735 --> 00:22:43.485
Hi.

309
00:22:48.277 --> 00:22:50.651
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I'm dead.

310
00:22:50.818 --> 00:22:52.610
- I'm dead, aren't I?
- It's okay.

311
00:22:52.777 --> 00:22:54.817
No, I'm dreaming. I must be dreaming.

312
00:22:54.985 --> 00:22:58.568
Okay. Now, those guys
in the black pajamas, they jumped me.

313
00:22:58.735 --> 00:23:00.109
And that rat...

314
00:23:00.277 --> 00:23:02.984
...I saw you in the parking lot.
That explains you.

315
00:23:03.235 --> 00:23:06.485
- And you guys... Um...
- Hmm?

316
00:23:08.069 --> 00:23:10.568
...I have no idea where you came from.

317
00:23:10.735 --> 00:23:14.651
If you will please just sit down
and calm yourself.

318
00:23:14.985 --> 00:23:16.942
I will tell you where we came from.

319
00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:18.193
It talks.

320
00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:21.485
It is really quite simple, Miss O'Neil.

321
00:23:21.985 --> 00:23:24.568
And he knows my name.

322
00:23:24.735 --> 00:23:26.526
Perfect.

323
00:23:26.694 --> 00:23:28.776
Fifteen years ago...

324
00:23:28.943 --> 00:23:31.817
Why don't I ever dream
of Harrison Ford?

325
00:23:34.985 --> 00:23:39.443
For 15 years now, we have lived here.

326
00:23:39.611 --> 00:23:46.401
Before that time,
I was a pet of my master Yoshi...

327
00:23:46.569 --> 00:23:50.068
...mimicking his movements
from my cage...

328
00:23:50.235 --> 00:23:53.984
...and learning the secret art of ninja.

329
00:23:55.069 --> 00:23:58.942
When we were forced
to come to New York...

330
00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:04.443
...I found myself for the first time
without a home...

331
00:24:04.611 --> 00:24:09.568
...wandering the sewers,
scavenging for whatever I could find.

332
00:24:09.735 --> 00:24:11.776
And then, one day...

333
00:24:11.943 --> 00:24:14.651
...I came upon a shattered glass jar...

334
00:24:14.818 --> 00:24:17.234
...and four baby turtles.

335
00:24:17.402 --> 00:24:18.942
- That was us. Heh-heh.
- Shut up.

336
00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:22.109
- Oh, no.
- Oh.

337
00:24:22.319 --> 00:24:27.485
The little ones were crawling
into a strange glowing ooze...

338
00:24:27.652 --> 00:24:31.151
...from a broken canister nearby.

339
00:24:31.735 --> 00:24:34.942
I gathered them up in an old coffee can...

340
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:39.318
...and when I awoke the next morning,
I received a shock...

341
00:24:39.486 --> 00:24:42.693
...for they had doubled in size.

342
00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:47.151
I too was growing,
particularly in intellect...

343
00:24:47.319 --> 00:24:51.068
...and I was amazed
at how intelligent they seemed.

344
00:24:51.235 --> 00:24:55.776
But nothing could have prepared me
for what happened next.

345
00:24:55.943 --> 00:24:57.776
One of them spoke.

346
00:24:57.943 --> 00:25:00.401
Pizza.

347
00:25:00.569 --> 00:25:02.276
More words followed...

348
00:25:02.611 --> 00:25:04.859
...and I began their training...

349
00:25:05.027 --> 00:25:08.401
...teaching them all that I had learned
from my master.

350
00:25:08.777 --> 00:25:10.485
Radical. Radical. Radical.

351
00:25:10.652 --> 00:25:14.151
And soon I gave them all names...

352
00:25:14.569 --> 00:25:16.443
...Leonardo...

353
00:25:16.611 --> 00:25:18.776
...Michaelangelo...
- That's me.

354
00:25:18.943 --> 00:25:20.443
...Donatello...

355
00:25:20.611 --> 00:25:23.151
...and Raphael.

356
00:25:27.444 --> 00:25:30.443
I'm not dreaming, am I?

357
00:25:30.611 --> 00:25:32.942
No, I'm afraid not.

358
00:25:37.652 --> 00:25:41.443
Ew. Are you guys sure
you know where you're going?

359
00:25:41.611 --> 00:25:42.817
11th and Bleecker?

360
00:25:44.194 --> 00:25:45.984
Nope. This is only 9th Street. Ha.

361
00:25:46.152 --> 00:25:47.193
- Get it?
- Yuck.

362
00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.109
Okay.

363
00:26:01.902 --> 00:26:03.693
Ah...

364
00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:06.401
I'd like to invite you all in...

365
00:26:06.569 --> 00:26:10.485
...but I really don't have anything to offer
you guys except for frozen pizza.

366
00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:12.984
Let's go for it.

367
00:26:14.319 --> 00:26:15.651
You said the magic word.

368
00:26:16.152 --> 00:26:19.234
- You guys eat pizza?
- Doesrt everybody?

369
00:26:19.402 --> 00:26:21.276
Yeah, well...

370
00:26:21.818 --> 00:26:23.318
...all right.

371
00:26:23.985 --> 00:26:25.610
Hey, did she say pizza?

372
00:26:25.777 --> 00:26:27.651
- So you live in an antique store?
- Yep.

373
00:26:27.818 --> 00:26:28.942
Pizza.

374
00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:31.026
Well, above, actually.

375
00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:34.276
What do you guys like on your pizza?

376
00:26:34.444 --> 00:26:35.984
Just the regular stuff.

377
00:26:36.152 --> 00:26:37.734
Flies, stink bugs.

378
00:26:39.611 --> 00:26:41.276
It was a joke. Ha-ha.

379
00:26:48.235 --> 00:26:50.651
Yeah, well, maybe I'll fight Apollo...

380
00:26:50.818 --> 00:26:52.485
...maybe I won't, you know?

381
00:26:52.652 --> 00:26:53.817
What do you think?

382
00:26:53.985 --> 00:26:56.068
- Adrian!
- Ha-ha-ha.

383
00:26:56.235 --> 00:26:57.651
Hey, I got another one.

384
00:26:58.277 --> 00:27:01.401
- This is totally cool.
- Oh, no, not Cagney.

385
00:27:02.527 --> 00:27:04.984
Mmm. You dirty rat.

386
00:27:05.152 --> 00:27:06.651
You killed my brother.

387
00:27:06.818 --> 00:27:08.859
You dirty rat. Mmm.

388
00:27:09.735 --> 00:27:11.485
Whoo-hoo. Ha-ha-ha.

389
00:27:11.652 --> 00:27:14.318
That must be Splinter's favorite. Ha-ha-ha.

390
00:27:14.486 --> 00:27:17.942
Huh?

391
00:27:19.319 --> 00:27:21.901
- It was a joke.
- Hmm?

392
00:27:29.902 --> 00:27:33.568
And speaking of which,
we better get going.

393
00:27:33.735 --> 00:27:35.151
He worries.

394
00:27:35.444 --> 00:27:39.526
Oh. Well, I don't know what to say.

395
00:27:39.694 --> 00:27:42.318
- Will I ever see you guys again?
- Indubitably.

396
00:27:42.486 --> 00:27:45.151
That depends
on how fast you stock your pizza.

397
00:27:45.319 --> 00:27:47.610
- Deal.
- See you around.

398
00:27:47.777 --> 00:27:50.193
- Bye.
- Later.

399
00:27:55.818 --> 00:27:58.485
Ha-ha. No doubt about it. She loved us.

400
00:27:58.652 --> 00:28:00.151
It was the impressions, dudes.

401
00:28:00.319 --> 00:28:01.817
- You wish.
- Hold it.

402
00:28:17.444 --> 00:28:19.318
Splinter.

403
00:28:48.027 --> 00:28:49.193
What's wrong?

404
00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:50.651
Splinter.

405
00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:03.610
555-5215.

406
00:29:09.818 --> 00:29:11.401
- Hello.
- Hello.

407
00:29:11.569 --> 00:29:12.734
Charles Pennington?

408
00:29:12.902 --> 00:29:14.359
Yeah. Who's this?

409
00:29:14.527 --> 00:29:17.109
You got a son named Danny, Charles?

410
00:29:34.985 --> 00:29:36.026
Who is it?

411
00:29:36.194 --> 00:29:39.276
- It's me, Charles.
- It's my boss.

412
00:29:40.652 --> 00:29:41.984
Can you guys...

413
00:29:43.235 --> 00:29:44.776
...hide?

414
00:29:49.777 --> 00:29:51.109
Charles, what's up?

415
00:29:51.277 --> 00:29:52.443
April...

416
00:29:52.611 --> 00:29:54.109
...listen.

417
00:29:55.486 --> 00:30:00.109
I've... You have been working awful hard
on this story lately.

418
00:30:00.277 --> 00:30:04.193
Why don't you take it easy for a while?
Just... Just...

419
00:30:04.943 --> 00:30:07.318
Just let somebody else handle it.

420
00:30:08.818 --> 00:30:11.151
Just for a little while, you know?

421
00:30:11.319 --> 00:30:14.026
Charles, what are you talking about?
It's my story. No way.

422
00:30:14.194 --> 00:30:15.776
Look at you. You're exhausted.

423
00:30:15.943 --> 00:30:17.151
I just had a rough night.

424
00:30:17.319 --> 00:30:20.109
Let somebody else help you
cover city hall.

425
00:30:20.277 --> 00:30:21.984
Charles, that's ridiculous.

426
00:30:22.152 --> 00:30:23.651
What's with you today?

427
00:30:23.943 --> 00:30:26.193
Nothing's with me today.

428
00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:28.568
I just thought you might like a little help.

429
00:30:28.735 --> 00:30:29.984
Well, I don't.

430
00:30:30.486 --> 00:30:33.942
- Hand me a towel, will you?
- Where do you keep the towels?

431
00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:37.359
- Charles, no.
- What's wrong?

432
00:30:37.527 --> 00:30:41.193
I just... I just don't want you to see
my unsightly bathtub ring. Okay?

433
00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:43.610
Just out, out, out.

434
00:30:43.777 --> 00:30:45.401
I have to get ready for work.

435
00:30:45.569 --> 00:30:47.568
Are you sure you won't reconsider
some help?

436
00:30:47.735 --> 00:30:50.234
Hey, Danny,
will you tell your father to relax?

437
00:30:50.402 --> 00:30:52.109
I wish.

438
00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:57.276
Just don't push any buttons today.
Okay?

439
00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:03.068
- That was close. Whoa!
- Hah!

440
00:31:03.235 --> 00:31:06.276
Time to switch to decaf, April.

441
00:31:06.777 --> 00:31:08.610
I don't get it, Danny.

442
00:31:08.777 --> 00:31:12.151
I make enough money to provide
for both of us and you're stealing.

443
00:31:12.319 --> 00:31:13.359
Why?

444
00:31:13.527 --> 00:31:15.817
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

445
00:31:16.235 --> 00:31:18.443
What were you doing
with a car stereo anyway?

446
00:31:18.611 --> 00:31:19.734
Or don't you know?

447
00:31:19.902 --> 00:31:21.651
- Sorry.
- Sorry?

448
00:31:21.818 --> 00:31:24.568
Not as sorry as you're gonna be
after school.

449
00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:27.817
Danny, damn it.

450
00:31:27.985 --> 00:31:29.734
Danny, come back here.

451
00:32:04.277 --> 00:32:05.859
How are you doing?

452
00:32:10.652 --> 00:32:13.485
Check it out, man.
Anything you guys want, we got it.

453
00:32:13.652 --> 00:32:16.151
Anything you want to do...

454
00:32:16.319 --> 00:32:18.859
...do it. Know what I'm saying?
Anything.

455
00:32:19.027 --> 00:32:21.485
You got any cigarettes?

456
00:32:22.943 --> 00:32:25.443
Regular or menthol?

457
00:32:32.444 --> 00:32:33.942
Read them and weep, boys.

458
00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:37.401
- Full house.
- Oh, no.

459
00:32:41.277 --> 00:32:43.109
Mmp! Mm-hm.

460
00:32:45.194 --> 00:32:47.776
Go. Play.

461
00:32:50.818 --> 00:32:51.901
All right.

462
00:32:54.402 --> 00:32:55.984
- Hah!
- Oh!

463
00:32:56.152 --> 00:32:59.109
- Hah! Hah!
- Aah! Ooh!

464
00:32:59.277 --> 00:33:00.318
How's this look?

465
00:33:00.985 --> 00:33:04.485
- Hah! Hah! Hah!
- Ooh.

466
00:33:04.652 --> 00:33:06.984
You. Hm!

467
00:33:09.818 --> 00:33:11.276
Mm.

468
00:33:22.569 --> 00:33:23.984
Good.

469
00:33:30.985 --> 00:33:34.610
Never lower your eyes to an enemy.

470
00:33:34.777 --> 00:33:36.942
Yes, Master Tatsu.

471
00:33:43.027 --> 00:33:44.485
All right.

472
00:33:47.486 --> 00:33:49.276
Yeah. I am.

473
00:34:51.277 --> 00:34:53.485
Master Shredder.

474
00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:40.109
Money cannot buy the honor
which you have earned tonight.

475
00:35:44.902 --> 00:35:48.318
You make us all proud.

476
00:35:52.152 --> 00:35:56.318
Only effort, discipline, loyalty...

477
00:35:56.486 --> 00:35:59.734
...earn the right to wear the dragon dogi.

478
00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:05.276
You are here
because the outside world rejects you.

479
00:36:05.444 --> 00:36:07.276
This is your family.

480
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:11.068
I am your father.

481
00:36:11.235 --> 00:36:18.234
I want you all to become full members
of The Foot.

482
00:36:18.527 --> 00:36:21.109
There is a new enemy...

483
00:36:21.277 --> 00:36:26.026
...freaks of nature
who interfere with our business.

484
00:36:26.194 --> 00:36:30.318
You are my eyes and ears. Find them.

485
00:36:30.486 --> 00:36:34.526
Together we will punish these...

486
00:36:34.818 --> 00:36:36.984
...creatures.

487
00:36:37.319 --> 00:36:39.693
These...

488
00:36:40.486 --> 00:36:41.942
...turtles.

489
00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:44.526
Master.

490
00:36:56.069 --> 00:36:58.026
This is beginning to sound
less and less...

491
00:36:58.194 --> 00:37:00.901
...like your common,
garden-variety subway mugging.

492
00:37:01.069 --> 00:37:03.651
- Exactly, June.
- Boy, she's a good reporter.

493
00:37:03.818 --> 00:37:08.151
- She's a babe.
- Organization known as The Foot.

494
00:37:08.319 --> 00:37:09.734
I'm sorry, The Foot?

495
00:37:09.902 --> 00:37:13.318
Yeah, I know it sounds like
a funky club for podiatrists...

496
00:37:13.486 --> 00:37:17.026
...but I've been speaking with Japanese-
Americans in the past few days...

497
00:37:17.194 --> 00:37:19.651
...who say that our crime wave
is reminiscent...

498
00:37:19.818 --> 00:37:22.234
...of a secret band of ninja thieves...

499
00:37:22.402 --> 00:37:24.276
...who once operated in Japan.

500
00:37:24.444 --> 00:37:26.276
Are the police looking into this?

501
00:37:26.444 --> 00:37:28.485
I've included everything
in my statement...

502
00:37:28.652 --> 00:37:30.984
...but I doubt very much
that Chief Sterns...

503
00:37:31.152 --> 00:37:33.984
...is taking this possible connection
seriously.

504
00:37:34.569 --> 00:37:38.485
- I see. Well, perhaps if any of our viewers...
- Oh, God.

505
00:37:38.652 --> 00:37:40.485
Mr. Pennington, Chief Sterns' office.

506
00:37:40.652 --> 00:37:42.859
- Contact local police
or get in touch with us...

507
00:37:43.027 --> 00:37:45.318
Pennington, I thought we had a deal!

508
00:37:45.611 --> 00:37:48.485
You still haven't told us
how you got away from your attacker.

509
00:37:48.652 --> 00:37:50.901
It's really quite incredible.

510
00:37:51.444 --> 00:37:54.776
Some citizens of New York
actually came to my rescue.

511
00:37:54.943 --> 00:37:58.485
Who says everyone in the Big Apple
looks the other way?

512
00:37:58.652 --> 00:38:01.109
Seriously,
I would like to take this opportunity...

513
00:38:01.277 --> 00:38:05.318
...to thank one of those individuals
in particular.

514
00:38:05.486 --> 00:38:08.651
And if he's watching, thanks, Raphael.

515
00:38:10.486 --> 00:38:11.984
Studly.

516
00:38:12.152 --> 00:38:13.401
Hey, look. Nyak-nyak.

517
00:38:13.569 --> 00:38:15.193
I think he's blushing. Heh.

518
00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:16.651
I am not.

519
00:38:17.110 --> 00:38:18.734
I think he's actually turning red.

520
00:38:21.569 --> 00:38:23.901
- Uh, hmm. Maybe not.
- Mm-hm.

521
00:38:25.527 --> 00:38:27.151
So, what do we do now?

522
00:38:27.319 --> 00:38:30.693
- What do you mean, what do we do now?
- Splinter's out there somewhere.

523
00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:32.817
I know Splinter's out there.

524
00:38:32.985 --> 00:38:34.359
- Fight?
- Fight.

525
00:38:34.527 --> 00:38:35.568
- Kitchen?
- Kitchen.

526
00:38:35.735 --> 00:38:38.401
- Yeah.
- So, what are we gonna do about it?

527
00:38:38.569 --> 00:38:39.942
What can we do about it?

528
00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:42.276
April's our only link to these guys.

529
00:38:42.444 --> 00:38:44.984
We have to wait
until she comes up with something.

530
00:38:45.152 --> 00:38:50.776
Oh, so that's the plan
from our great leader, huh?

531
00:38:50.943 --> 00:38:52.610
Just sit here on our butts.

532
00:38:52.777 --> 00:38:55.651
I never said I was your great leader.

533
00:38:55.818 --> 00:38:57.568
Well, you sure act like it sometimes.

534
00:38:57.735 --> 00:39:00.984
Yeah? Well, you act like a jerk sometimes,
you know that?

535
00:39:01.152 --> 00:39:03.984
And this attitude of yours
isn't helping anything.

536
00:39:04.152 --> 00:39:07.151
Well, maybe I'll just take my attitude
and leave!

537
00:39:07.319 --> 00:39:08.942
- Why don't you?
- I will.

538
00:39:09.110 --> 00:39:10.276
- Good.
- Great.

539
00:39:10.444 --> 00:39:12.817
Go ahead. We don't need you.

540
00:39:15.194 --> 00:39:16.984
Pork rind?

541
00:39:17.152 --> 00:39:18.942
Pork rind.

542
00:39:19.818 --> 00:39:21.443
Damn!

543
00:39:23.694 --> 00:39:24.984
Hah!

544
00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:27.485
Ha-ah!

545
00:40:02.527 --> 00:40:03.734
Go.

546
00:40:03.902 --> 00:40:05.234
Move it, will you?

547
00:40:05.402 --> 00:40:07.151
You're letting him blow right by you.

548
00:40:07.319 --> 00:40:09.193
- Can you believe this guy?
- Hmm?

549
00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:10.984
Come on. Don't just...

550
00:40:11.152 --> 00:40:13.984
Ninja-kick the damn rabbit.
Do something.

551
00:40:14.152 --> 00:40:15.610
Hey.

552
00:40:15.818 --> 00:40:19.151
- April, hey, you were great.
- Thanks, Mikey.

553
00:40:19.319 --> 00:40:22.193
Ho... She called me Mikey.

554
00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:28.901
Hear anything yet?

555
00:40:29.069 --> 00:40:30.776
Not yet.

556
00:40:31.319 --> 00:40:33.485
They're gonna repeat the interview
at 5 and 6.

557
00:40:33.652 --> 00:40:37.234
And we're gonna have to wait and see
if it helps generate any new information.

558
00:40:37.402 --> 00:40:38.984
Mmm.

559
00:40:39.152 --> 00:40:41.443
Hey, I told them to call me here
immediately...

560
00:40:41.611 --> 00:40:43.651
...if anyone calls the station.

561
00:40:43.818 --> 00:40:45.234
Thanks, April.

562
00:40:45.402 --> 00:40:48.318
We really appreciate,
you know, everything.

563
00:40:48.486 --> 00:40:49.651
Yeah.

564
00:40:49.818 --> 00:40:52.318
Hey, forget it.

565
00:40:53.652 --> 00:40:55.068
Where's Raphael?

566
00:41:01.319 --> 00:41:05.318
Well, I was gonna give you guys
a tour of the store.

567
00:41:05.486 --> 00:41:08.734
- Shall we go get him?
- No.

568
00:41:08.902 --> 00:41:11.568
- He just needs to blow off some steam.
- Yeah.

569
00:41:12.027 --> 00:41:16.318
You guys must be studying
the abridged book of ninja fighting.

570
00:41:23.943 --> 00:41:26.359
Come on, come here. Come here.

571
00:41:31.277 --> 00:41:32.651
I mean, come on.

572
00:41:32.818 --> 00:41:35.651
How do you guys expect to beat me?

573
00:41:38.069 --> 00:41:41.276
Good answer.

574
00:41:41.777 --> 00:41:45.485
I only keep it open part-time,
mostly for my dad.

575
00:41:45.652 --> 00:41:47.651
Heh. He loved junk.

576
00:41:47.818 --> 00:41:50.568
I don't know.
It's dumb to lose money on a business...

577
00:41:50.735 --> 00:41:52.942
...just because you miss your father.

578
00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:55.026
No, it isn't.

579
00:41:57.319 --> 00:41:58.318
Ready?

580
00:42:06.319 --> 00:42:09.984
- This place has everything.
- Yup, just about.

581
00:42:10.652 --> 00:42:12.193
Shh.

582
00:42:13.319 --> 00:42:15.234
Eeeee.

583
00:42:16.235 --> 00:42:18.193
Aah!

584
00:42:22.569 --> 00:42:24.568
Hasrt Raph been gone a long time?

585
00:42:24.735 --> 00:42:27.151
No. He does it all the time. He likes it.

586
00:42:29.277 --> 00:42:30.734
Are you sure?

587
00:42:30.902 --> 00:42:34.651
Don't worry.
He'll probably be back any minute.

588
00:42:35.985 --> 00:42:37.276
Raph!

589
00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:38.901
Is he...?

590
00:42:39.069 --> 00:42:40.776
- No, he's alive. Barely.
- Oh, God.

591
00:42:50.985 --> 00:42:53.318
- Hey, what the...?
- Whoa.

592
00:42:53.486 --> 00:42:55.901
And I thought insurance salesmen
were pushy.

593
00:42:59.985 --> 00:43:03.401
Ohh. A fellow chucker, eh?

594
00:43:05.444 --> 00:43:06.901
What?

595
00:43:07.069 --> 00:43:11.610
Oh-woh-oh. Oh-oh.
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh. Wah!

596
00:43:23.152 --> 00:43:24.901
Oh.

597
00:43:30.652 --> 00:43:31.693
Hmm-hmm.

598
00:43:35.069 --> 00:43:36.109
Hah.

599
00:43:38.985 --> 00:43:40.109
Keep practicing.

600
00:43:50.402 --> 00:43:51.443
Take that.

601
00:43:57.735 --> 00:44:00.734
Hey, one of these guys must know
where they're holding Splinter.

602
00:44:00.902 --> 00:44:03.485
So don't knock them all out.

603
00:44:04.152 --> 00:44:06.401
I don't think that will be a problem, Leo.

604
00:44:17.611 --> 00:44:19.318
Gotcha.

605
00:44:22.110 --> 00:44:25.068
Hey, Donnie, Wheel of Fortune, dude.

606
00:44:30.527 --> 00:44:32.776
Bisen-tos. Now!

607
00:44:34.611 --> 00:44:36.193
I guess they're not game show fans.

608
00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:39.776
- And I thought everybody loved Vanna.
- Aah! Whoa!

609
00:44:43.943 --> 00:44:45.485
California roll. Ooh.

610
00:44:46.027 --> 00:44:47.651
Oh, what a spaz.

611
00:44:47.818 --> 00:44:50.151
- Missed again.
- Good thing they aren't lumberjacks.

612
00:44:50.319 --> 00:44:51.359
No joke.

613
00:44:51.527 --> 00:44:55.151
The only thing safe in the woods
would be the trees.

614
00:44:57.569 --> 00:45:01.026
Guys, I'm not so sure if this is,
structurally speaking...

615
00:45:01.194 --> 00:45:03.984
...such a good time
for your buddies to drop in.

616
00:45:09.569 --> 00:45:11.734
- Uh-oh.
- Aah!

617
00:45:14.319 --> 00:45:16.526
Oh, whoa. Wipeout.

618
00:45:22.277 --> 00:45:23.318
- Huh?
- Hmm?

619
00:45:24.027 --> 00:45:27.151
- Hmm.
- Oh, no.

620
00:45:29.569 --> 00:45:30.610
Mm.

621
00:45:38.319 --> 00:45:41.401
Ha-ha. Ha-ha-ha-ha. Oh!

622
00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:43.817
Ooh. Ooh.

623
00:45:48.902 --> 00:45:50.151
Hey, hey, hey.

624
00:45:54.277 --> 00:45:55.610
Hai!

625
00:46:08.152 --> 00:46:11.817
Man, we could really use
Raph right about now.

626
00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:21.276
Now what?

627
00:46:25.486 --> 00:46:30.193
Oh. You guys mind telling me what you're
doing to my little green pal over there?

628
00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:31.734
Mm?

629
00:46:32.486 --> 00:46:35.276
Oh, who is the babe?

630
00:46:35.444 --> 00:46:37.734
Who the heck is that?

631
00:46:37.902 --> 00:46:40.776
Wayne Gretzky on steroids?

632
00:46:41.486 --> 00:46:43.068
Attack.

633
00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:54.443
Aaa-aaa-aah!

634
00:47:00.110 --> 00:47:02.068
Come on, we got to get out of here.

635
00:47:08.277 --> 00:47:11.443
Help me. There used to be
a trapdoor here to the basement.

636
00:47:11.611 --> 00:47:13.443
Yeah, come on, you ugly muggers.

637
00:47:13.611 --> 00:47:15.234
Come on.

638
00:47:16.735 --> 00:47:18.734
We're getting out of here.

639
00:47:21.569 --> 00:47:24.485
Gangway, men.
I'll take care of these guys.

640
00:47:27.319 --> 00:47:30.151
- You coming?
- I'll cover you.

641
00:47:30.527 --> 00:47:31.610
Good idea.

642
00:47:35.735 --> 00:47:37.318
Hi, this is April.

643
00:47:37.486 --> 00:47:39.276
- Leave a message after the beep.
- What?

644
00:47:39.985 --> 00:47:41.734
April, it's Charles.

645
00:47:42.027 --> 00:47:44.610
I'm sorry.
I don't know how else to say this.

646
00:47:44.777 --> 00:47:45.901
You're fired, April.

647
00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:50.193
I'm sorry. I know this comes as a blow.

648
00:47:50.569 --> 00:47:53.401
- You can say that again, Chuck.
- Come on.

649
00:47:53.569 --> 00:47:55.485
Bye, guys, got to run.

650
00:47:59.569 --> 00:48:01.651
Ninja, vanish.

651
00:48:09.277 --> 00:48:10.568
Oh.

652
00:48:43.027 --> 00:48:47.151
What are these freaks?

653
00:48:47.319 --> 00:48:50.443
How do they know how to fight like this?

654
00:48:52.943 --> 00:48:56.526
You will answer.

655
00:48:57.694 --> 00:49:01.318
Then hang there until you die.

656
00:49:35.652 --> 00:49:37.942
Whoa.
Master Tatsu, stop, please, please.

657
00:49:38.110 --> 00:49:39.776
Please, no.

658
00:49:46.402 --> 00:49:49.817
Shinsho.

659
00:49:51.444 --> 00:49:53.734
You'll be all right. You'll be all right.

660
00:50:13.943 --> 00:50:18.859
How can a face so young
wear so many burdens?

661
00:50:19.027 --> 00:50:21.776
So you can talk.

662
00:50:21.943 --> 00:50:26.443
Yes, and I can also listen.

663
00:50:27.194 --> 00:50:31.151
Some say that the path
from inner turmoil...

664
00:50:31.319 --> 00:50:34.942
...begins with a friendly ear.

665
00:50:35.319 --> 00:50:37.651
My ear is open...

666
00:50:37.818 --> 00:50:41.942
...if you care to use it.
- No, I don't think so.

667
00:50:42.110 --> 00:50:44.068
What is your name?

668
00:50:45.818 --> 00:50:46.859
Danny.

669
00:50:47.027 --> 00:50:49.817
And have you no one to go to, Danny?

670
00:50:49.985 --> 00:50:51.109
No parent?

671
00:50:51.277 --> 00:50:53.568
My dad couldn't care less about me.

672
00:50:54.444 --> 00:50:56.984
I doubt that is true.

673
00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:00.318
Why?

674
00:51:01.486 --> 00:51:06.817
All fathers care for their sons.

675
00:51:16.319 --> 00:51:19.485
- How's Raphael?
- Not so good.

676
00:51:19.652 --> 00:51:22.193
Hey, didn't they use this place
in The Grapes of Wrath?

677
00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:24.234
Very funny.

678
00:51:24.402 --> 00:51:27.942
I told you,
I haven't been up here in years.

679
00:51:34.527 --> 00:51:36.318
Can you fix it?

680
00:51:42.486 --> 00:51:44.026
Does that answer your question?

681
00:51:44.194 --> 00:51:47.485
I mean, the block's got a crack in it
the size of the San Andreas.

682
00:51:47.652 --> 00:51:49.318
- Wonderful.
- Ah.

683
00:51:50.319 --> 00:51:53.026
Well, I guess
I've got some walking to do.

684
00:51:53.194 --> 00:51:54.526
What for?

685
00:51:54.694 --> 00:51:57.109
Our nearest neighbor
is about four miles away.

686
00:51:57.277 --> 00:51:59.901
I need to get to a phone,
and I need to call my boss.

687
00:52:00.069 --> 00:52:01.485
You mean Charles?

688
00:52:01.652 --> 00:52:02.693
How did you know that?

689
00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:06.068
Well, he left a message on your machine
just before we got out.

690
00:52:06.235 --> 00:52:07.568
And?

691
00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:12.109
Well, hey, you just saved yourself
an eight-mile round-tripper.

692
00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:14.651
You were fired.

693
00:52:15.152 --> 00:52:16.651
I'm...

694
00:52:17.902 --> 00:52:19.443
- I just saved myself?
- Yeah.

695
00:52:19.611 --> 00:52:20.817
- Uh-oh.
- What did you do?

696
00:52:20.985 --> 00:52:23.276
Did you take classes in insensitivity?

697
00:52:23.444 --> 00:52:26.984
- I was just trying to break it to you easy.
- Oh, well, you failed miserably.

698
00:52:27.152 --> 00:52:30.359
Hey, Broadzilla, you wouldn't be here
if it werert for me, okay?

699
00:52:30.527 --> 00:52:33.151
Oh, and what do you want?
Do you want a thank you?

700
00:52:33.319 --> 00:52:36.651
No. It's me who should thank you
for that privilege, right?

701
00:52:36.818 --> 00:52:38.776
- Fine. Thank you.
- Yeah. No, thank you.

702
00:52:38.943 --> 00:52:41.734
- You're welcome.
- You're welcome.

703
00:52:43.444 --> 00:52:47.776
Gosh, it's kind of like Moonlighting,
isn't it?

704
00:52:47.943 --> 00:52:49.401
- Heh.
- Mm-hm.

705
00:52:58.735 --> 00:53:01.318
It's strange being back on the old farm.

706
00:53:01.486 --> 00:53:05.485
Even after all these years,
it still feels like home.

707
00:53:05.652 --> 00:53:09.485
My amazing new friends
have suffered their first real defeat.

708
00:53:09.652 --> 00:53:10.859
That's bad enough...

709
00:53:11.027 --> 00:53:14.568
...but they've also lost the opportunity
to find out about their mentor...

710
00:53:14.735 --> 00:53:18.193
...and I'm sure that hurts them
much more than anything else.

711
00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:21.817
Each of them deals with this confusion
in his own way.

712
00:53:21.985 --> 00:53:24.817
Donatello has found someone
to latch onto.

713
00:53:24.985 --> 00:53:28.068
Not even close, zip neck.

714
00:53:28.235 --> 00:53:31.817
The Professor and Mary Ann,
happily ever after.

715
00:53:31.985 --> 00:53:33.817
No way, atomic mouth.

716
00:53:33.985 --> 00:53:35.693
Gilligan was her main man.

717
00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:38.026
They'd be married
and have six kids by now.

718
00:53:38.194 --> 00:53:40.401
Gilligan was a geek, barfaroni.

719
00:53:40.569 --> 00:53:43.734
- You're the geek, camel breath.
- Dome head.

720
00:53:44.194 --> 00:53:45.734
Hmm!

721
00:53:45.943 --> 00:53:47.901
Elf lips.

722
00:53:48.985 --> 00:53:53.234
Let's give this a try,
see if this transplant worked, fungoid.

723
00:53:53.402 --> 00:53:56.485
- All right, here it goes. What are we on?
- Uh...

724
00:53:56.652 --> 00:53:57.859
- G.
- Heh.

725
00:53:58.027 --> 00:53:59.485
Here goes, gack face.

726
00:53:59.652 --> 00:54:01.776
I'm ready, hose brain.

727
00:54:10.319 --> 00:54:13.859
It worked. Uh... Hey.

728
00:54:15.152 --> 00:54:19.485
Leonardo, meanwhile,
has kept a constant vigil with Raphael.

729
00:54:54.818 --> 00:54:57.151
He'll be okay.

730
00:55:02.402 --> 00:55:04.151
And then there's Casey Jones...

731
00:55:04.319 --> 00:55:06.610
...a 9-year-old trapped in a mars body.

732
00:55:06.777 --> 00:55:10.610
He might almost be cute
if it wasn't for that pigheadedness.

733
00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:12.942
Donatello.

734
00:55:13.110 --> 00:55:14.776
He's out with the others...

735
00:55:14.943 --> 00:55:17.401
...they're exercising.

736
00:55:17.569 --> 00:55:19.693
Doing something together, I don't know.

737
00:55:20.110 --> 00:55:21.776
You want some help?

738
00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:26.734
- Ah.
- Hey, I am your man. I am Mr. Fix-it.

739
00:55:27.152 --> 00:55:28.485
All right.

740
00:55:28.652 --> 00:55:31.359
- Let's go.
- Lead the way, toots.

741
00:55:32.943 --> 00:55:35.817
- Toots?
- Oh... Babe?

742
00:55:37.110 --> 00:55:38.651
Sweetcakes?

743
00:55:39.652 --> 00:55:42.318
Ah! Princess.

744
00:55:42.527 --> 00:55:44.859
Do you want to throw me a clue here?
I'm drowning.

745
00:55:45.027 --> 00:55:46.984
You know what? That's okay.

746
00:55:47.152 --> 00:55:49.776
- I'll take care of it myself.
- Fine, that's up to you.

747
00:55:49.943 --> 00:55:52.942
Just don't come around here
asking for my help anymore.

748
00:55:53.110 --> 00:55:54.817
See, I wouldn't ask for your help...

749
00:55:54.985 --> 00:55:59.651
...if you were the last thing
on the face of this planet.

750
00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:02.485
It's coming along nicely.

751
00:56:09.611 --> 00:56:11.318
- Hey.
- What?

752
00:56:13.652 --> 00:56:14.984
Raph.

753
00:56:15.152 --> 00:56:17.984
You're awake. How do you feel?

754
00:56:18.444 --> 00:56:22.526
What's a guy got to do
to get some food around here?

755
00:56:22.694 --> 00:56:24.984
Hey. Hey, he's awake.

756
00:56:25.152 --> 00:56:26.693
He wants some food.

757
00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:29.234
Bring some food.

758
00:56:29.402 --> 00:56:31.526
You're gonna be okay, Raph.

759
00:56:31.694 --> 00:56:33.193
You're gonna be okay.

760
00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:35.568
Yeah, yeah, all right, Leo.

761
00:56:35.735 --> 00:56:37.817
Get a grip, will you?

762
00:56:37.985 --> 00:56:39.318
Listen, Raph.

763
00:56:41.277 --> 00:56:43.485
About what I said before...

764
00:56:45.319 --> 00:56:46.401
...you know...

765
00:56:46.569 --> 00:56:49.485
...about not needing you and all, like...

766
00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:51.276
Leo...

767
00:56:51.444 --> 00:56:52.984
...don't.

768
00:56:53.152 --> 00:56:55.734
Oh, boy, we missed you.

769
00:56:57.110 --> 00:56:58.817
It's a Kodak moment.

770
00:57:07.735 --> 00:57:09.901
The turtles are four once again...

771
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:11.817
...and yet, still not whole.

772
00:57:13.110 --> 00:57:15.568
A lingering doubt remains.

773
00:57:15.735 --> 00:57:18.443
An unknown
which they can't bear to face...

774
00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:20.901
...their greatest fear.

775
00:57:21.069 --> 00:57:24.485
Splinter!

776
00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:32.693
Your empire flourishes, Master Shredder.

777
00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:35.485
- No, no, no, that's a stereo.
- What more from the rat?

778
00:57:35.652 --> 00:57:36.651
Nothing.

779
00:57:36.818 --> 00:57:38.610
He will not speak.

780
00:57:38.777 --> 00:57:41.151
And the boy who led us to the turtles?

781
00:57:41.319 --> 00:57:43.984
He is still missing.

782
00:57:44.277 --> 00:57:46.318
I do not understand.

783
00:57:46.486 --> 00:57:49.359
Why do the turtles trouble you, master?

784
00:57:49.527 --> 00:57:52.234
They have not been seen for many days.

785
00:57:52.402 --> 00:57:57.776
Something about the way
you described their fighting.

786
00:57:57.943 --> 00:58:01.026
Something familiar.

787
00:58:02.235 --> 00:58:03.817
Something...

788
00:58:05.444 --> 00:58:08.693
...from the past.

789
00:59:17.152 --> 00:59:18.610
- Ointment?
- Mm-mm.

790
00:59:19.027 --> 00:59:20.068
Hey, guys.

791
00:59:21.818 --> 00:59:22.817
Hmm.

792
00:59:25.611 --> 00:59:27.610
Oh, God.

793
00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:30.234
Funny, Mikey.

794
00:59:52.235 --> 00:59:54.068
Leonardo.

795
00:59:54.527 --> 00:59:56.651
Hah. Splinter.

796
00:59:57.110 --> 01:00:01.234
What Russian novel,
embracing more than 500 characters...

797
01:00:01.402 --> 01:00:03.651
...is set in the Napoleonic Wars?

798
01:00:03.818 --> 01:00:04.817
War and Peace.

799
01:00:05.152 --> 01:00:06.734
He's alive.

800
01:00:06.902 --> 01:00:08.109
- Hey.
- Thanks, spaz.

801
01:00:08.277 --> 01:00:10.151
Splinter's alive.

802
01:00:10.319 --> 01:00:12.318
We know, Leo. Of course he is.

803
01:00:12.486 --> 01:00:13.817
We all think he's alive.

804
01:00:13.985 --> 01:00:15.984
I don't think.

805
01:00:16.152 --> 01:00:17.817
- I know.
- Huh?

806
01:00:17.985 --> 01:00:19.026
Huh?

807
01:00:24.818 --> 01:00:26.443
Leo...

808
01:00:26.818 --> 01:00:29.568
...if you dragged us
out here for nothing...

809
01:00:29.735 --> 01:00:32.151
Don't worry. I came prepared.

810
01:00:32.319 --> 01:00:33.568
- Put those away.
- Heh-heh.

811
01:00:33.735 --> 01:00:34.942
Heh.

812
01:00:36.611 --> 01:00:40.151
Now, everybody close your eyes
and concentrate.

813
01:00:40.319 --> 01:00:42.485
Concentrate hard.

814
01:01:08.985 --> 01:01:12.942
I am proud of you, my sons.

815
01:01:13.110 --> 01:01:15.610
Tonight you have learned...

816
01:01:15.777 --> 01:01:20.526
...the final and greatest truth
of the ninja...

817
01:01:20.694 --> 01:01:26.068
...that ultimate mastery
comes not of the body...

818
01:01:26.235 --> 01:01:28.610
...but of the mind.

819
01:01:28.777 --> 01:01:34.234
Together, there is nothing
your four minds cannot accomplish.

820
01:01:34.402 --> 01:01:35.526
Help each other.

821
01:01:35.694 --> 01:01:38.318
Draw upon one another.

822
01:01:38.486 --> 01:01:44.318
And always remember
the true force that binds you...

823
01:01:44.486 --> 01:01:49.193
...the same as that
which brought me here tonight...

824
01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:55.401
...that which I gladly return
with my final words.

825
01:01:55.694 --> 01:01:58.901
I love you all, my sons.

826
01:02:05.694 --> 01:02:08.859
Huh. Huh? Uh... Huh.

827
01:02:37.611 --> 01:02:40.401
So you actually played professionally?

828
01:02:40.569 --> 01:02:43.942
Before I got hurt, less than a year.

829
01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:47.318
I'm sorry.

830
01:02:47.486 --> 01:02:49.318
- So was I.
- Ah-ah-ahem.

831
01:02:52.652 --> 01:02:54.068
Guys, I told you...

832
01:02:54.235 --> 01:02:56.817
...I hate it when you do that, all right?

833
01:02:57.735 --> 01:02:59.318
What is it?

834
01:02:59.818 --> 01:03:02.401
It's time to go back.

835
01:03:22.235 --> 01:03:26.568
Oh, no. Oh.

836
01:03:26.735 --> 01:03:28.234
- Home sweet home.
- Ha-ha.

837
01:03:28.402 --> 01:03:29.443
Yuch.

838
01:03:30.110 --> 01:03:32.568
I know what it's like to travel
without a green card.

839
01:03:32.735 --> 01:03:33.817
This isn't bad.

840
01:03:33.985 --> 01:03:36.485
Nice place, guys. In fact, l...

841
01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:39.901
Are you coming or not, dude?

842
01:03:44.486 --> 01:03:46.193
This is great, it's great.

843
01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:49.651
First it's the farm that time forgot,
and now this.

844
01:03:49.818 --> 01:03:52.901
Why don't I ever fall in
with people who own condos?

845
01:03:53.777 --> 01:03:57.151
Guess it's hard to get
good maid service in a sewer.

846
01:03:57.818 --> 01:03:59.693
Maybe you guys should try Roto-Rooter.

847
01:03:59.860 --> 01:04:02.485
Would you quit complaining?
It's just for the night.

848
01:04:02.652 --> 01:04:05.485
I still don't see
why we don't get started right away.

849
01:04:05.652 --> 01:04:07.401
It's been a long drive, Raph.

850
01:04:07.569 --> 01:04:10.485
And before we go out advertising
to The Foot that we're back...

851
01:04:10.652 --> 01:04:13.318
...we could all use a few hours' sleep.
Yeah.

852
01:04:13.486 --> 01:04:16.651
I know, you're right. I'm just...
What's that?

853
01:04:20.277 --> 01:04:21.734
- Danny?
- Don't shoot.

854
01:04:21.902 --> 01:04:24.485
- I don't think it's loaded, kid.
- Danny...

855
01:04:24.652 --> 01:04:26.026
...what are you doing here?

856
01:04:26.194 --> 01:04:28.485
- Where'd he come from?
- Beats me.

857
01:04:28.652 --> 01:04:30.193
I ran away from home.

858
01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:33.734
Oh, God,
your father's gonna have kittens.

859
01:04:33.902 --> 01:04:35.817
- Does this thing work?
- No.

860
01:04:35.985 --> 01:04:37.776
No, please don't call.

861
01:04:37.943 --> 01:04:39.901
Just let me stay here the night with you.

862
01:04:40.069 --> 01:04:41.817
We can call in the morning. I promise.

863
01:04:41.985 --> 01:04:44.485
- Danny, listen, your dad, he's...
- Hold on, hold it.

864
01:04:44.652 --> 01:04:49.276
Okay, now, what is all this talk
about spending the night down here?

865
01:04:49.569 --> 01:04:51.568
You're a claustrophobic.

866
01:04:54.152 --> 01:04:56.485
- Do you want a fist in the mouth?
- Mm-mm.

867
01:04:56.652 --> 01:04:58.734
I've never even looked
at another guy before.

868
01:04:58.902 --> 01:05:03.026
What he means is that
you're afraid of enclosed areas.

869
01:05:03.652 --> 01:05:05.318
Afraid?

870
01:05:07.110 --> 01:05:10.526
- What, me? Is that what you think?
- Mm-hm.

871
01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:15.984
Ah. Hey, I don't have to take this stuff
about being afraid.

872
01:05:19.069 --> 01:05:21.318
I'm gonna sleep in the truck.

873
01:05:29.319 --> 01:05:31.859
Jeez, these are good.

874
01:05:32.027 --> 01:05:33.151
Thanks.

875
01:05:33.319 --> 01:05:35.151
Do you think maybe I could have one?

876
01:05:35.611 --> 01:05:37.485
- Sure, why not?
- Thanks.

877
01:05:38.818 --> 01:05:40.234
Oh, man, I could really go...

878
01:05:40.402 --> 01:05:42.859
...for a little deep-dish action
right about now.

879
01:05:43.027 --> 01:05:45.401
I had some pizza down here
the other day.

880
01:05:45.569 --> 01:05:47.651
- There might be some left over.
- Mm? Mm? Uh-huh.

881
01:05:47.902 --> 01:05:49.485
- Wa-ah. Wa-ah-aah!
- Ha-ha-ha.

882
01:05:51.652 --> 01:05:53.651
- Well?
- Question.

883
01:05:53.818 --> 01:05:57.651
- Yeah?
- Do you like penicillin on your pizza?

884
01:05:57.818 --> 01:05:59.984
Oh! Ugh.

885
01:06:11.152 --> 01:06:13.776
"Afraid of enclosed areas."

886
01:06:41.069 --> 01:06:42.817
You are here...

887
01:06:42.985 --> 01:06:46.485
...because the outside world rejects you.

888
01:06:46.652 --> 01:06:49.193
And you have no one to go to, Danny?

889
01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:51.068
This is your family.

890
01:06:51.235 --> 01:06:54.901
All fathers care for their sons.

891
01:08:05.486 --> 01:08:06.651
Nice shot, man.

892
01:08:07.277 --> 01:08:09.109
I need a cigar.

893
01:08:09.277 --> 01:08:11.610
Where is my cigar?

894
01:08:17.069 --> 01:08:18.984
Hey.

895
01:08:19.152 --> 01:08:21.651
Great how you did that, it rocks.

896
01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:35.817
I have not seen you for days.

897
01:08:36.777 --> 01:08:40.651
Yeah, I've been down at my hideout
a lot lately.

898
01:08:41.152 --> 01:08:46.359
And do you now hide
from your surrogate family as well?

899
01:08:48.652 --> 01:08:50.234
I don't know.

900
01:08:50.694 --> 01:08:52.318
I too...

901
01:08:52.486 --> 01:08:54.984
...once had a family, Danny.

902
01:08:56.277 --> 01:08:58.151
Many years ago...

903
01:08:58.319 --> 01:09:00.693
...I lived in Japan...

904
01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:03.734
...a pet of my master, Yoshi...

905
01:09:03.902 --> 01:09:06.734
...mimicking his movements
from my cage...

906
01:09:06.902 --> 01:09:11.485
...and learning
the mysterious art of Ninjitsu...

907
01:09:11.652 --> 01:09:16.485
...for Yoshi was one of Japars
finest shadow warriors.

908
01:09:16.652 --> 01:09:22.318
His only rival was
a man named Oroku Saki...

909
01:09:22.486 --> 01:09:25.610
...and they competed in all things...

910
01:09:25.777 --> 01:09:31.568
...but none more fiercely
than for the love of a woman.

911
01:09:31.735 --> 01:09:33.859
Tang Shen.

912
01:09:34.777 --> 01:09:38.068
Shers love was only for my master...

913
01:09:38.235 --> 01:09:41.276
...and rather than see him
fight Saki for her hand...

914
01:09:41.444 --> 01:09:43.151
...she persuaded Yoshi...

915
01:09:43.319 --> 01:09:45.984
...to flee with me to America...

916
01:09:46.152 --> 01:09:48.651
...but Saki vowed vengeance.

917
01:09:48.818 --> 01:09:50.984
I remember it well.

918
01:09:51.152 --> 01:09:53.651
As my master returned home...

919
01:09:53.818 --> 01:09:57.693
...to find his beloved Shen
lying on the floor.

920
01:09:58.152 --> 01:10:00.443
And then he saw her killer.

921
01:10:00.777 --> 01:10:04.151
Saki wasted no words,
and during the struggle...

922
01:10:04.319 --> 01:10:05.651
...my cage was broken.

923
01:10:05.985 --> 01:10:09.234
I leapt to Saki's face,
biting and clawing...

924
01:10:09.402 --> 01:10:11.151
...but he threw me to the floor...

925
01:10:11.319 --> 01:10:14.901
...and took one swipe with his katana,
slicing my ear.

926
01:10:16.444 --> 01:10:20.651
Then he was gone and I was alone.

927
01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:27.359
Whatever happened to this Oroku Saki?

928
01:10:27.777 --> 01:10:30.526
No one really knows...

929
01:10:30.694 --> 01:10:35.651
...but you wear his symbol
upon your brow.

930
01:11:06.694 --> 01:11:08.984
What are you doing in there, boy?

931
01:11:09.152 --> 01:11:10.651
Nothing.

932
01:11:20.486 --> 01:11:22.276
Where have you been?

933
01:11:22.818 --> 01:11:24.651
Nowhere.

934
01:11:25.152 --> 01:11:26.984
You're lying to me.

935
01:11:27.152 --> 01:11:30.610
- No.
- And you're hiding something as well.

936
01:11:30.818 --> 01:11:32.234
Shaah!

937
01:11:56.985 --> 01:11:59.651
They're back.

938
01:12:02.735 --> 01:12:04.734
Master.

939
01:12:04.902 --> 01:12:07.942
There will be no mistake this time.

940
01:12:08.110 --> 01:12:09.817
I go myself.

941
01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:11.901
And the rat...

942
01:12:12.652 --> 01:12:14.151
...kill it.

943
01:12:15.486 --> 01:12:16.610
Come on, men.

944
01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:23.318
- Hey, what do you want?
- Shh, shh.

945
01:12:23.486 --> 01:12:24.734
Recognize me now, kid?

946
01:12:24.902 --> 01:12:27.485
- Hey, what's the deal?
- You got to come with me.

947
01:12:27.652 --> 01:12:31.901
- What are you talking about come with you?
- They're gonna kill Splinter.

948
01:13:18.652 --> 01:13:20.776
Hee-hee-hee. No sweat.

949
01:13:22.152 --> 01:13:25.817
Gosh, I do hope there's more of them.

950
01:13:30.027 --> 01:13:31.568
- Huh?
- Ah.

951
01:13:31.735 --> 01:13:33.776
Good.

952
01:13:42.152 --> 01:13:44.151
Well, where are the keys?

953
01:13:47.152 --> 01:13:49.817
Who are you?

954
01:13:50.069 --> 01:13:51.359
Hey.

955
01:13:53.069 --> 01:13:55.817
- Ahh.
- The name's Casey Jones.

956
01:13:58.027 --> 01:13:59.610
A friend.

957
01:14:04.735 --> 01:14:06.485
Let's get out of here.

958
01:14:24.611 --> 01:14:26.734
A little to the right. A little to the left.

959
01:14:27.194 --> 01:14:28.734
One more time.

960
01:14:28.902 --> 01:14:30.984
A little bit more like that.

961
01:14:31.152 --> 01:14:32.984
And stop. Perfect.

962
01:14:34.110 --> 01:14:35.151
Aah!

963
01:14:35.319 --> 01:14:37.942
- You're a natural, sis.
- Thanks.

964
01:14:38.194 --> 01:14:39.776
Ha! Ha-ha! Ha!

965
01:14:46.277 --> 01:14:51.942
Now, you know, a little Primatene
might just help to clear that up there.

966
01:14:54.235 --> 01:14:56.234
That's gonna cost you, Tinker Bell.

967
01:14:58.027 --> 01:15:00.817
I don't think that you're listening.

968
01:15:07.152 --> 01:15:13.526
You know, I'm starting to pick up
on a little language barrier thing going here.

969
01:15:34.319 --> 01:15:35.485
Fore.

970
01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:48.276
I'll never call golf a dull game again.

971
01:15:53.402 --> 01:15:55.568
Gangway.

972
01:16:07.319 --> 01:16:09.318
Showoff.

973
01:16:10.319 --> 01:16:13.234
What are we just standing here for?
Let's get him.

974
01:16:15.985 --> 01:16:18.651
Do you want to be first, junior, huh?

975
01:16:18.818 --> 01:16:20.485
We have a loyalty to The Shredder.

976
01:16:20.860 --> 01:16:22.485
The Shredder uses you.

977
01:16:23.152 --> 01:16:27.151
He poisons your minds
to obtain that which he desires.

978
01:16:29.277 --> 01:16:34.068
He cares nothing for you
or the people you hurt.

979
01:16:35.486 --> 01:16:36.734
We're a family.

980
01:16:38.486 --> 01:16:41.901
Family? Is that what you said? Family?

981
01:16:42.860 --> 01:16:45.942
You call this here...

982
01:16:46.110 --> 01:16:48.276
...and that down there, family?

983
01:17:00.694 --> 01:17:02.817
Casey.

984
01:17:25.652 --> 01:17:27.942
Hey, dudes, where you going?

985
01:17:28.152 --> 01:17:29.276
Hai!

986
01:17:29.444 --> 01:17:33.443
Ha! Hey, Donnie, looks like this one's
suffering from shell shock. Ha!

987
01:17:33.652 --> 01:17:35.234
Hmm. Too derivative.

988
01:17:36.985 --> 01:17:39.610
Boy, I guess we can really shell it out.

989
01:17:39.777 --> 01:17:41.651
Too clich

990
01:17:42.611 --> 01:17:45.651
Well, it was a shell of a good hit.

991
01:17:45.818 --> 01:17:48.693
I like it. Step up.

992
01:17:49.943 --> 01:17:53.109
Awesome. Ha! Ha! Ha!

993
01:17:54.902 --> 01:17:57.568
Hey, where do you think you're going?

994
01:18:02.235 --> 01:18:03.318
- Hey.
- Hmm.

995
01:18:03.486 --> 01:18:05.817
Hey, wait for me.

996
01:18:06.152 --> 01:18:08.193
Whoop! Yaah!

997
01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:11.526
God, I love being a turtle!

998
01:18:22.569 --> 01:18:24.859
Ha-ha! Yee-ha!

999
01:18:30.444 --> 01:18:31.984
Oh!

1000
01:18:32.152 --> 01:18:37.443
Come on, come on.

1001
01:18:56.985 --> 01:18:59.151
Aw. No more?

1002
01:19:10.652 --> 01:19:11.901
Nyah. Nyak-nyak.

1003
01:19:12.902 --> 01:19:17.318
Does anybody have any idea
about who or what this is?

1004
01:19:17.486 --> 01:19:18.776
I don't know...

1005
01:19:18.943 --> 01:19:21.109
...but I'll bet it never has to look
for a can opener.

1006
01:19:23.319 --> 01:19:27.485
You fight well in the old style...

1007
01:19:27.652 --> 01:19:30.151
...but you've caused me enough trouble.

1008
01:19:30.902 --> 01:19:33.443
Now you face...

1009
01:19:33.611 --> 01:19:35.109
...The Shredder.

1010
01:19:36.069 --> 01:19:38.068
- The Shredder? Heh.
- Uh...

1011
01:19:38.235 --> 01:19:40.859
Maybe all that hardware's
for making coleslaw.

1012
01:19:41.444 --> 01:19:42.984
I got him.

1013
01:19:49.069 --> 01:19:51.109
- This guy's good.
- Yeah.

1014
01:19:51.277 --> 01:19:53.485
- Why don't you go next?
- Thank you.

1015
01:19:57.943 --> 01:20:00.817
Uh... Match you for it?

1016
01:20:02.110 --> 01:20:04.109
One, two, three. Mm.

1017
01:20:04.277 --> 01:20:05.984
- Damn.
- Great. Wah!

1018
01:20:08.735 --> 01:20:10.151
Come on.

1019
01:20:16.943 --> 01:20:19.359
So much for family, huh?

1020
01:20:21.152 --> 01:20:23.776
Yeah, I'm just so hungry, you know.

1021
01:20:25.486 --> 01:20:26.610
Now...

1022
01:20:26.777 --> 01:20:28.984
...at exactly what point...

1023
01:20:29.152 --> 01:20:31.234
...did we lose control here?

1024
01:20:31.402 --> 01:20:35.318
Maybe somebody ought to tell him
that we're the good guys.

1025
01:20:35.486 --> 01:20:36.776
- Yeah.
- Any thoughts?

1026
01:20:36.943 --> 01:20:38.817
I've only got one thought.

1027
01:20:38.985 --> 01:20:41.151
This guy knows where Splinter is.

1028
01:20:46.069 --> 01:20:48.485
Looks like your boys
are going to need a little...

1029
01:20:50.319 --> 01:20:51.693
Where did he go?

1030
01:21:11.152 --> 01:21:12.776
Oh, boy.

1031
01:21:12.943 --> 01:21:14.859
Leftovers.

1032
01:21:30.152 --> 01:21:31.901
Yee-ha!

1033
01:21:42.569 --> 01:21:44.318
It's a talent.

1034
01:22:00.985 --> 01:22:02.734
Where's Splinter?

1035
01:22:03.860 --> 01:22:07.401
- Ah. The rat, so it has a name.
- Huh?

1036
01:22:09.152 --> 01:22:10.651
It had a name.

1037
01:22:13.152 --> 01:22:14.485
You lie.

1038
01:22:16.486 --> 01:22:18.485
Do I?

1039
01:22:26.277 --> 01:22:27.318
He dies.

1040
01:22:27.611 --> 01:22:30.984
- Huh?
- Weapons.

1041
01:22:33.152 --> 01:22:36.276
- Now.
- Oh.

1042
01:22:44.069 --> 01:22:46.026
Fools. Ha-ha.

1043
01:22:46.194 --> 01:22:50.485
The three of you might have
overpowered me with the loss of but one.

1044
01:22:51.069 --> 01:22:55.151
Now your fate will be his.

1045
01:22:55.319 --> 01:22:56.734
No.

1046
01:22:58.194 --> 01:22:59.234
Oh.

1047
01:22:59.402 --> 01:23:01.193
Splinter.

1048
01:23:02.694 --> 01:23:06.318
- Aah.
- Yes, Oroku Saki.

1049
01:23:06.486 --> 01:23:08.485
I know who you are.

1050
01:23:09.611 --> 01:23:12.485
We met many years ago...

1051
01:23:12.777 --> 01:23:15.568
...in the home of my master...

1052
01:23:15.735 --> 01:23:17.234
...Hamato Yoshi.

1053
01:23:23.818 --> 01:23:25.651
It's him.

1054
01:23:27.194 --> 01:23:29.901
You.

1055
01:23:31.110 --> 01:23:35.942
Now I will finish
what I began with your ear.

1056
01:23:48.985 --> 01:23:52.776
Death comes for us all, Oroku Saki...

1057
01:23:52.943 --> 01:23:56.151
...but something much worse
comes for you.

1058
01:23:56.319 --> 01:23:58.817
For when you die, it will be...

1059
01:24:08.777 --> 01:24:10.651
- Without honor.

1060
01:24:11.777 --> 01:24:13.193
Oops.

1061
01:24:22.486 --> 01:24:25.443
- Splinter, are you okay?
- Oh, Splinter.

1062
01:24:25.777 --> 01:24:28.193
Oh, Splinter, we were so worried.

1063
01:24:29.818 --> 01:24:30.817
Kids.

1064
01:24:37.985 --> 01:24:41.359
- I can't wait...
- I was there. I saw the whole thing.

1065
01:24:41.527 --> 01:24:44.276
- All right.
- Whatever.

1066
01:24:45.694 --> 01:24:47.068
Okay, okay, move along here.

1067
01:24:54.486 --> 01:24:55.984
You, you, come here.

1068
01:24:56.152 --> 01:24:59.109
- Tell me when it's on.
- Hold the battery.

1069
01:24:59.277 --> 01:25:01.568
All right, guys, let's get to it.

1070
01:25:01.735 --> 01:25:03.485
Brian, it's over.

1071
01:25:03.652 --> 01:25:06.651
- It's over.
- April.

1072
01:25:06.818 --> 01:25:08.568
- April. April, here.
- Danny.

1073
01:25:08.735 --> 01:25:10.234
- See you later.
- What's this for?

1074
01:25:10.402 --> 01:25:11.859
It's something I owe you.

1075
01:25:12.027 --> 01:25:14.026
- Trust me.
- Come on, let's move it back.

1076
01:25:14.194 --> 01:25:15.942
You there, come here.

1077
01:25:18.277 --> 01:25:19.776
Dad.

1078
01:25:19.943 --> 01:25:21.359
Danny?

1079
01:25:22.110 --> 01:25:24.485
Danny.

1080
01:25:24.652 --> 01:25:26.401
God, where have you been?

1081
01:25:26.569 --> 01:25:29.026
I've had the whole city looking for you.

1082
01:25:29.194 --> 01:25:30.734
Are you all right?

1083
01:25:30.902 --> 01:25:32.693
- Are you okay, Danny?
- It's okay, Dad.

1084
01:25:32.860 --> 01:25:35.651
I'm okay, really. I'm okay.

1085
01:25:35.818 --> 01:25:37.526
And Dad?

1086
01:25:37.694 --> 01:25:40.151
It's just Dan now, okay?

1087
01:25:42.402 --> 01:25:43.984
Dan?

1088
01:25:45.818 --> 01:25:47.193
Come on, folks.

1089
01:25:48.319 --> 01:25:50.109
- Come on.
- What have you been up to?

1090
01:25:50.277 --> 01:25:52.817
I want some stretchers in here.
Get some doctors.

1091
01:25:52.985 --> 01:25:55.610
Don't move. Get those kids.
Don't let them get away.

1092
01:25:56.027 --> 01:25:59.151
April, I told you
there were circumstances.

1093
01:25:59.319 --> 01:26:02.151
I really need you to cover this.

1094
01:26:02.818 --> 01:26:05.151
I don't know, Charles, you know...

1095
01:26:05.319 --> 01:26:08.651
Did you know that May Williams
over at Channel 5 has her own office?

1096
01:26:08.818 --> 01:26:10.068
You can have an office.

1097
01:26:10.235 --> 01:26:12.151
Yeah, well,
she has her own corner office.

1098
01:26:12.319 --> 01:26:13.984
- You can have a corner office.
- Well.

1099
01:26:14.152 --> 01:26:17.151
She's one of the highest-paid
field reporters in New York City.

1100
01:26:17.319 --> 01:26:19.485
Now you are.

1101
01:26:23.486 --> 01:26:26.485
You are a tough negotiator, Charles.

1102
01:26:27.277 --> 01:26:29.443
All right, I want some answers.

1103
01:26:30.319 --> 01:26:34.234
Now, what in God's name
happened out here tonight?

1104
01:26:34.860 --> 01:26:36.817
Somebody better talk to me.

1105
01:26:36.985 --> 01:26:39.109
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1106
01:26:39.277 --> 01:26:42.942
Go check out the East Warehouse
over at Lairdman Island.

1107
01:26:43.110 --> 01:26:44.984
You'll get your answers there.

1108
01:26:45.152 --> 01:26:48.151
How are you doing, lady?

1109
01:26:49.027 --> 01:26:50.151
All right, let's go.

1110
01:26:53.902 --> 01:26:55.901
I've been looking all over for you.

1111
01:26:56.069 --> 01:26:58.485
Oh, Casey, hi.

1112
01:26:58.860 --> 01:27:00.151
"Hi"?

1113
01:27:00.319 --> 01:27:01.401
You...

1114
01:27:01.569 --> 01:27:06.151
I look like
I just called Mike Tyson a sissy.

1115
01:27:06.319 --> 01:27:07.693
Yeah?

1116
01:27:07.985 --> 01:27:09.651
And all you say is hi?

1117
01:27:10.902 --> 01:27:13.984
What?
You don't need an ambulance, do you?

1118
01:27:14.860 --> 01:27:16.276
No, but I was...

1119
01:27:16.444 --> 01:27:20.068
Will you just shut up and kiss me, okay?
I got a report to do.

1120
01:27:23.110 --> 01:27:24.984
- I love it when you're pushy.
- Yeah?

1121
01:27:25.152 --> 01:27:26.734
Yeah.

1122
01:27:28.110 --> 01:27:29.276
Whoo-hoo.

1123
01:27:29.444 --> 01:27:32.151
Nine-point-nine-five.

1124
01:27:32.319 --> 01:27:33.942
All right, April.

1125
01:27:34.110 --> 01:27:36.568
All right, Casey.

1126
01:27:36.735 --> 01:27:38.318
Yeah, that's the way to go.

1127
01:27:40.194 --> 01:27:42.359
We were awesome.

1128
01:27:42.527 --> 01:27:45.151
- Bodacious.
- Yeah.

1129
01:27:45.319 --> 01:27:47.193
- Bitching.
- Yeah.

1130
01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:49.401
Uh...

1131
01:27:49.569 --> 01:27:51.193
- Gnarly.
- Ha-ha-ha.

1132
01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:52.651
Radical.

1133
01:27:52.818 --> 01:27:56.026
- Yeah. Ha-ha.
- Totally tubular, dude.

1134
01:27:56.194 --> 01:27:57.401
Wicked.

1135
01:27:57.568 --> 01:28:00.400
Hellacious.

1136
01:28:00.570 --> 01:28:02.173
- Mega...
- Ahem.

1137
01:28:03.322 --> 01:28:06.069
I have always liked...

1138
01:28:08.816 --> 01:28:10.405
...cowabunga.

1139
01:28:10.814 --> 01:28:12.163
- Hmm?
- Huh?

1140
01:28:12.313 --> 01:28:15.650
Cowabunga!

1141
01:28:17.528 --> 01:28:18.734
I made a funny.

1142
01:28:21.359 --> 01:28:22.982
- Yeah.
- Ha-ha-ha.
