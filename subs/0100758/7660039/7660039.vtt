<i>Much more than just a series
of small, isolated incidents...</i>

2
00:01:15.328 --> 00:01:19.784
<i>it's apparent an organized
criminal element is at work.</i>

3
00:01:19.962 --> 00:01:22.224
<i>And at the moment,
business is good.</i>

4
00:01:22.396 --> 00:01:26.385
<i>So good, in fact, there appear
to be no eyewitnesses...</i>

5
00:01:26.562 --> 00:01:27.960
<i>to any of these crimes.</i>

6
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.459
With complaints ranging
from purse-snatching...

7
00:01:30.629 --> 00:01:31.959
<i>to breaking and entering...</i>

8
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.959
<i>police switchboards have been
swamped...</i>

9
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.960
<i>with the angry voices
of more and more citizens...</i>

10
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.255
<i>who have fallen prey
to the recent surge of crime...</i>

11
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.259
<i>that continues
to plague the city.</i>

12
00:01:57.298 --> 00:02:02.357
<i>Instead of getting better,
things have gotten worse.</i>

13
00:02:02.532 --> 00:02:03.827
<i>Even more alarming
is the baffling...</i>

14
00:02:03.998 --> 00:02:08.124
<i>and often bizarre
nature of these crimes.</i>

15
00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:11.829
<i>Merchandise of every size
and description...</i>

16
00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:14.329
<i>from skateboards
to stereo systems...</i>

17
00:02:14.499 --> 00:02:16.727
<i>has been disappearing
from store shelves...</i>

18
00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:19.922
<i>and storage areas
at an alarming rate.</i>

19
00:02:23.466 --> 00:02:27.365
<i>Even the victims themselves
rarely glimpse the thieves.</i>

20
00:02:27.533 --> 00:02:31.227
<i>Many don't know they've been
victimized until it's too late.</i>

21
00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:36.561
<i>In fact, police have yet
to come up with an eyewitness.</i>

22
00:02:36.734 --> 00:02:38.563
<i>Only a few vague reports...</i>

23
00:02:38.734 --> 00:02:43.064
<i>of young boys or teenagers
at the scenes have been filed.</i>

24
00:02:43.235 --> 00:02:47.065
<i>But whoever is behind these
crimes, one thing is certain.</i>

25
00:02:47.235 --> 00:02:52.759
<i>These are much more than just
a series of random incidents.</i>

26
00:02:56.002 --> 00:02:57.729
Come on. Hurry up.

27
00:03:09.304 --> 00:03:10.667
Good.

28
00:03:16.704 --> 00:03:18.761
<i>Crimes without criminals?</i>

29
00:03:18.938 --> 00:03:20.597
<i>An invisible gang at work?</i>

30
00:03:20.771 --> 00:03:22.260
<i>Who are we going to call?</i>

31
00:03:22.437 --> 00:03:25.665
<i>Unfortunately, the police
are the only ones available...</i>

32
00:03:25.837 --> 00:03:30.293
<i>to combat what some are dubbing
"the silent crime wave."</i>

33
00:03:30.471 --> 00:03:33.063
<i>But perhaps the most
disturbing silence...</i>

34
00:03:33.238 --> 00:03:35.568
<i>is that coming from City Hall.</i>

35
00:03:35.738 --> 00:03:39.193
<i>April O'Neil,
Channel Three Eyewitness News.</i>

36
00:03:39.372 --> 00:03:41.133
You got to stop working so hard.

37
00:03:41.306 --> 00:03:44.136
What, give up all this glamour?

38
00:03:44.306 --> 00:03:47.101
Good night.

39
00:04:23.775 --> 00:04:25.264
Bad timing.

40
00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:27.466
You're telling me.

41
00:04:27.642 --> 00:04:29.972
Get her purse.

42
00:04:30.143 --> 00:04:33.268
Get away from me!
What do you think... Help!

43
00:04:33.442 --> 00:04:35.738
- Get her jewelry.
- I got her watch!

44
00:04:53.744 --> 00:04:56.710
What the hell's going on?
Thought I'd seen it all.

45
00:05:00.444 --> 00:05:02.501
All right. Come on, tough guys.

46
00:05:06.245 --> 00:05:07.233
You all right, ma'am?

47
00:05:07.412 --> 00:05:08.901
I'm fine.

48
00:05:09.078 --> 00:05:12.068
Rest right here
while we deal with these guys.

49
00:05:18.912 --> 00:05:20.901
Ted, give John a hand.

50
00:05:21.079 --> 00:05:23.409
Oh, man.

51
00:05:26.813 --> 00:05:28.711
Let's get them in the car.

52
00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:29.937
Damn.

53
00:05:55.782 --> 00:05:58.771
Oh, spectacular.

54
00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:00.279
We were awesome, bros.

55
00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:01.709
Awesome!

56
00:06:01.882 --> 00:06:03.075
Yes, dudes and dude-ettes...

57
00:06:03.249 --> 00:06:06.340
major league butt-kicking
is back in town.

58
00:06:11.716 --> 00:06:13.444
Awesome!

59
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:15.779
Righteous!

60
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.973
- Bossa nova!
- What?

61
00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:20.741
Bossa nova?

62
00:06:20.917 --> 00:06:22.849
Chevy Nova?

63
00:06:25.817 --> 00:06:27.408
Excellent!

64
00:06:29.351 --> 00:06:30.408
All right!

65
00:06:30.584 --> 00:06:32.413
Come on, let's move it.

66
00:06:32.584 --> 00:06:33.914
I'm starving.

67
00:06:34.084 --> 00:06:35.073
We're talking...

68
00:06:35.251 --> 00:06:36.239
major pizza attack here, dudes.

69
00:06:36.418 --> 00:06:39.748
Pizza! I need it. Oh, baby.

70
00:06:39.918 --> 00:06:41.850
Oh, man!

71
00:06:45.118 --> 00:06:46.448
What's eating him, bros?

72
00:06:46.619 --> 00:06:47.949
Give me three.

73
00:06:48.118 --> 00:06:49.607
You got it.

74
00:06:52.619 --> 00:06:55.051
We were great.

75
00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.684
Damn!

76
00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.250
We have had our first battle...

77
00:07:08.421 --> 00:07:10.614
Master Splinter.

78
00:07:10.787 --> 00:07:14.515
They were many, but we kicked...

79
00:07:14.688 --> 00:07:16.677
We fought well.

80
00:07:16.854 --> 00:07:19.684
Were you seen?

81
00:07:19.854 --> 00:07:23.980
In this you must never lapse.

82
00:07:24.155 --> 00:07:25.984
Even those who would be...

83
00:07:26.155 --> 00:07:29.713
our allies would not understand.

84
00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:33.377
Our domain is the shadow.

85
00:07:33.555 --> 00:07:35.612
tray from it reluctantly.

86
00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:38.119
For when you do, you must...

87
00:07:38.289 --> 00:07:41.119
strike hard and fade away...

88
00:07:42.656 --> 00:07:45.020
Without a trace.

89
00:07:46.356 --> 00:07:47.652
I lost a sai.

90
00:07:47.823 --> 00:07:49.289
Then it is gone.

91
00:07:49.456 --> 00:07:50.388
But I can get it back.

92
00:07:50.556 --> 00:07:53.387
Raphael... let it go.

93
00:07:59.657 --> 00:08:03.714
Your ninja skills
are reaching their peak.

94
00:08:03.891 --> 00:08:10.723
Only one truly important lesson
remains, but must wait.

95
00:08:10.892 --> 00:08:15.620
I know it is hard
for you here underground.

96
00:08:15.792 --> 00:08:18.656
I want a large thick crust
with double cheese...

97
00:08:18.825 --> 00:08:19.950
ham, pepperoni...

98
00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:23.955
Your teenage minds
are broad, eager.

99
00:08:24.125 --> 00:08:28.683
But you must never stop
practicing the art of ninja...

100
00:08:28.859 --> 00:08:32.417
the art of invisibility.

101
00:08:32.592 --> 00:08:34.582
Oh, but no anchovies.

102
00:08:34.759 --> 00:08:36.521
And I mean no anchovies.

103
00:08:36.694 --> 00:08:40.558
You put anchovies on this thing,
and you're in big trouble.

104
00:08:40.727 --> 00:08:41.750
Michaelangelo!

105
00:08:41.927 --> 00:08:44.449
That'll do.
And the clock's ticking, dude.

106
00:08:48.328 --> 00:08:51.089
You are still young...

107
00:08:51.261 --> 00:08:55.421
but one day, I will be gone.

108
00:08:55.594 --> 00:08:59.458
Use my teachings wisely.

109
00:08:59.628 --> 00:09:06.186
I suggest we all meditate now
on the events of this evening.

110
00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:26.019
Ninjitsu!

111
00:09:26.197 --> 00:09:29.288
Well, this is like meditating.

112
00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:33.026
Hey, Raph, where you going?

113
00:09:33.197 --> 00:09:35.095
Out to a movie.

114
00:09:36.764 --> 00:09:38.229
That OK with you?

115
00:09:46.265 --> 00:09:48.197
Sock it to me, baby.

116
00:10:06.933 --> 00:10:08.263
How you doing?

117
00:10:08.433 --> 00:10:09.490
Fine.

118
00:10:11.766 --> 00:10:13.426
Nice night.

119
00:10:15.233 --> 00:10:18.063
Pizza dude's got 30 seconds.

120
00:10:20.901 --> 00:10:24.924
Mikey, did you ever think about
what Splinter said tonight?

121
00:10:25.101 --> 00:10:31.091
I mean, about what it would
be like not having him?

122
00:10:33.568 --> 00:10:36.363
Time's up. Three bucks off.

123
00:10:49.769 --> 00:10:54.395
Now, 122... 122 1/8?

124
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:57.593
One-twenty-two and an eigth?

125
00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:01.930
Terrific. Where the heck is 122 1/8?

126
00:11:02.104 --> 00:11:05.127
You're standing on it, dude.

127
00:11:05.304 --> 00:11:07.361
Just slip it down here.

128
00:11:13.671 --> 00:11:16.137
Give me that!

129
00:11:17.871 --> 00:11:22.236
This is a 10. The tab's 13.

130
00:11:22.405 --> 00:11:23.734
You're two minutes late, dude.

131
00:11:23.905 --> 00:11:26.770
Come on!
I couldn't find the place!

132
00:11:26.938 --> 00:11:29.097
Wise man say,
"Forgiveness is divine...

133
00:11:29.272 --> 00:11:32.103
"but never pay full price
for late pizza."

134
00:11:32.273 --> 00:11:35.364
I got to get a new route.

135
00:11:35.539 --> 00:11:37.130
And I thought
I delivered everywhere.

136
00:11:37.306 --> 00:11:40.704
Yes, friends,
the new Turbo Ginsu!

137
00:11:40.873 --> 00:11:42.566
It dices, it slices...

138
00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.797
and yet makes french fries
in 30 different...

139
00:11:47.473 --> 00:11:49.497
Kids.

140
00:12:03.375 --> 00:12:06.364
Where do they come up
with this stuff?

141
00:12:17.009 --> 00:12:18.907
Somebody stop them!

142
00:12:37.077 --> 00:12:39.703
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know.

143
00:12:39.877 --> 00:12:44.310
That was a crime,
you purse-grabbing pukes...

144
00:12:44.477 --> 00:12:46.307
and this is the penalty.

145
00:12:47.944 --> 00:12:50.274
Two minutes for slashing,
two minutes for hooking...

146
00:12:50.445 --> 00:12:53.775
and let's not forget
my personal favorite...

147
00:12:53.945 --> 00:12:56.376
two minutes for high-sticking.

148
00:12:57.378 --> 00:13:01.243
How about a five-minute game
misconduct for roughing, pal?

149
00:13:01.412 --> 00:13:02.900
Hey, Bogey...

150
00:13:03.079 --> 00:13:04.511
who died and made you referee?

151
00:13:04.679 --> 00:13:06.474
You did your job. Get out
of here and let me do mine.

152
00:13:06.646 --> 00:13:08.236
These JV lowlifes need
to be taught a lesson.

153
00:13:08.412 --> 00:13:11.606
Not like that they don't.
Not from you.

154
00:13:14.612 --> 00:13:19.102
It looks like you're
the one who needs a lesson, pal.

155
00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:23.213
Class is Pain 101.
Your instructor is Casey Jones.

156
00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:25.903
I don't want to fight you.

157
00:13:26.081 --> 00:13:27.876
Tough rocks, pal.

158
00:13:30.648 --> 00:13:32.671
A Jose Canseco bat?

159
00:13:32.848 --> 00:13:35.473
Tell me... you didn't
pay money for this.

160
00:13:36.648 --> 00:13:38.080
That's it.

161
00:13:38.248 --> 00:13:40.577
Was a two-for-one sale, pal.

162
00:13:41.982 --> 00:13:44.744
Hey, what are you,
some sort of punker?

163
00:13:46.182 --> 00:13:48.671
I hate punkers.

164
00:13:48.849 --> 00:13:51.280
Especially bald ones
with green makeup...

165
00:13:51.449 --> 00:13:53.938
who wear masks over ugly faces.

166
00:13:54.116 --> 00:13:55.173
That's it.

167
00:13:56.216 --> 00:13:59.046
New batter! Strike one!

168
00:13:59.216 --> 00:14:00.943
Whiffer.

169
00:14:04.283 --> 00:14:05.772
Home run.

170
00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:09.039
Raphael wins!

171
00:14:09.217 --> 00:14:11.876
One-nothing!

172
00:14:15.551 --> 00:14:16.676
Well?

173
00:14:16.851 --> 00:14:18.407
New game, roundhead.

174
00:14:20.918 --> 00:14:22.009
Cricket.

175
00:14:22.185 --> 00:14:25.810
Cricket?
Nobody understands cricket.

176
00:14:25.985 --> 00:14:28.577
You got to know what a crumpet
is to understand cricket.

177
00:14:28.752 --> 00:14:30.843
I'll teach you.

178
00:14:35.485 --> 00:14:36.644
Six runs.

179
00:14:42.286 --> 00:14:44.684
So long, freak.
I got work to do.

180
00:14:44.853 --> 00:14:46.216
Freak?!

181
00:14:55.387 --> 00:14:57.319
What the heck was that?

182
00:14:57.487 --> 00:15:01.317
Looked like a big turtle
in a trench coat.

183
00:15:01.487 --> 00:15:03.578
You going to La Guardia?

184
00:15:03.754 --> 00:15:06.220
Come back here!
I'm not finished with you!

185
00:15:06.388 --> 00:15:08.979
Damn!

186
00:15:23.589 --> 00:15:25.248
Come sit by me.

187
00:15:25.422 --> 00:15:27.411
Couldn't this wait till morning?

188
00:15:27.589 --> 00:15:29.748
You will listen now.

189
00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:44.085
My master Yoshi's
first rule was...

190
00:15:45.358 --> 00:15:48.085
Possess the right thinking.

191
00:15:48.257 --> 00:15:51.655
Only then can one receive...

192
00:15:51.824 --> 00:15:56.382
the gifts of strength,
knowledge, and peace.

193
00:16:00.192 --> 00:16:04.420
I have tried to channel
your anger, Raphael...

194
00:16:04.592 --> 00:16:06.717
but more remains.

195
00:16:06.892 --> 00:16:10.654
Anger clouds the mind.

196
00:16:10.826 --> 00:16:15.690
Turned inward,
it is an unconquerable enemy.

197
00:16:16.859 --> 00:16:20.314
You are unique
among your brothers...

198
00:16:20.493 --> 00:16:25.323
for you choose
to face this enemy alone.

199
00:16:25.493 --> 00:16:31.188
But as you face it,
do not forget them.

200
00:16:31.361 --> 00:16:35.020
And do not forget me.

201
00:16:36.661 --> 00:16:41.958
I am here, my son.

202
00:16:43.095 --> 00:16:43.161
April, you could've called me
last night, you know?

203
00:16:43.161 --> 00:16:46.355
April, you could've called me
last night, you know?

204
00:16:46.528 --> 00:16:48.323
Call it a quirk,
but I like to know...

205
00:16:48.495 --> 00:16:50.723
when one of my best reporters
has been mugged.

206
00:16:50.895 --> 00:16:52.155
I wasn't mugged, Charles.

207
00:16:52.328 --> 00:16:54.158
Besides,
I knew you'd just worry...

208
00:16:54.328 --> 00:16:57.489
and rush over here
like you did this morning.

209
00:16:57.662 --> 00:16:59.821
From now on,
security is gonna escort you...

210
00:16:59.996 --> 00:17:02.155
to that stone-age van of yours
every night.

211
00:17:02.329 --> 00:17:04.921
- Yes, sir.
- I'm not kidding, April.

212
00:17:05.096 --> 00:17:07.289
Hey, Danny, how's school going?

213
00:17:07.463 --> 00:17:09.486
- Fine.
- Wonderful.

214
00:17:09.663 --> 00:17:13.494
So wonderful I have to drive
him there every morning now...

215
00:17:13.664 --> 00:17:14.959
just to make sure he goes.

216
00:17:17.297 --> 00:17:20.388
That's what he does
when he wants to ignore me...

217
00:17:20.564 --> 00:17:23.030
sticks his head in those things.

218
00:17:23.198 --> 00:17:26.686
I wonder where the hell
he got those things, anyway.

219
00:17:26.864 --> 00:17:28.660
Charles, give the kid a break.

220
00:17:30.131 --> 00:17:33.962
Just what is going on
out there, April?

221
00:17:34.131 --> 00:17:36.859
I've never seen anything
like this before.

222
00:17:37.032 --> 00:17:38.827
It's like
the city's falling apart.

223
00:17:38.999 --> 00:17:42.193
It's getting so you can't step
outside in the daytime anymore.

224
00:17:42.366 --> 00:17:44.127
I'll tell you one thing.

225
00:17:44.299 --> 00:17:47.129
After everything I've been
hearing out of Little Tokyo...

226
00:17:47.299 --> 00:17:49.629
terns is gonna have some
answering to do this afternoon.

227
00:17:49.799 --> 00:17:52.357
Just take it easy.

228
00:17:52.532 --> 00:17:55.590
He's already got the mayor
breathing down my neck.

229
00:17:55.766 --> 00:17:58.665
We are presently executing
a plan of redeployment...

230
00:17:58.834 --> 00:18:00.663
that will minimize
response time...

231
00:18:00.834 --> 00:18:03.994
while maximizing coordination
between patrol units...

232
00:18:04.167 --> 00:18:07.156
in a decentralized
networking scheme.

233
00:18:09.201 --> 00:18:13.065
I'm not sure I understood
all that, Chief terns.

234
00:18:13.234 --> 00:18:17.133
Would you mind repeating it...
in English, perhaps?

235
00:18:17.301 --> 00:18:22.598
What that means, Miss O'Neil,
is everything is well in hand.

236
00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:25.928
Hey, guys, look. That's her.

237
00:18:26.102 --> 00:18:28.432
<i>I didn't say that either,
Miss O'Neil.</i>

238
00:18:28.602 --> 00:18:31.091
<i>If you would stick
to asking questions...</i>

239
00:18:33.402 --> 00:18:34.561
I'm in love.

240
00:18:34.736 --> 00:18:36.599
<i>What do you know
about an organization...</i>

241
00:18:36.769 --> 00:18:38.099
<i>known as The Foot Clan?</i>

242
00:18:38.269 --> 00:18:42.167
<i>There is no evidence to link
such a name to these incidents.</i>

243
00:18:42.336 --> 00:18:46.167
<i>Are you denying an organization
known as The Foot exists?</i>

244
00:18:46.336 --> 00:18:48.235
<i>I'm not denying anything.</i>

245
00:18:48.404 --> 00:18:51.131
<i>You're putting words
into my mouth.</i>

246
00:18:51.304 --> 00:18:55.031
Find her.

247
00:18:55.204 --> 00:18:57.295
Silence her.

248
00:18:57.471 --> 00:19:00.437
- He's great.
- An understatement as usual.

249
00:19:00.604 --> 00:19:03.264
You're telling me.
The girl is a fox.

250
00:19:03.438 --> 00:19:04.994
<i>Take a look at the local
weather for this vicinity...</i>

251
00:19:05.171 --> 00:19:06.296
<i>as it stands at this hour.</i>

252
00:19:06.472 --> 00:19:09.029
O'Neil, get in here.

253
00:19:10.772 --> 00:19:12.169
Time me.

254
00:19:19.373 --> 00:19:21.601
Just what is it you
hoped to accomplish out there...

255
00:19:21.773 --> 00:19:23.102
besides busting my chops?

256
00:19:23.272 --> 00:19:27.830
I think you know as much
as I do about this Foot Clan...

257
00:19:28.007 --> 00:19:30.235
and I don't think you're
doing anything about it.

258
00:19:30.407 --> 00:19:32.202
You expect me to waste
precious manpower...

259
00:19:32.374 --> 00:19:34.567
because a few immigrants
are reminded of something...

260
00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:37.764
that supposedly happened
years ago in Japan?

261
00:19:37.941 --> 00:19:39.270
Have you got something else?

262
00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:43.532
Are you trying to tell me
how to do my job?

263
00:19:45.074 --> 00:19:47.972
One minute, seven seconds...
a new record.

264
00:20:08.509 --> 00:20:12.669
Oh... great. Just great.

265
00:20:23.643 --> 00:20:26.041
We've been waiting for you,
Miss O'Neil.

266
00:20:26.211 --> 00:20:30.541
Am I behind
on my Sony payments again?

267
00:20:30.711 --> 00:20:35.041
Your mouth may yet bring you
much trouble, Miss O'Neil.

268
00:20:35.211 --> 00:20:37.905
I deliver a message.

269
00:20:40.345 --> 00:20:41.537
Shut it.

270
00:20:46.779 --> 00:20:49.404
All right. That's it!

271
00:21:50.384 --> 00:21:50.417
Are you crazy?

272
00:21:50.417 --> 00:21:52.406
Are you crazy?

273
00:21:53.417 --> 00:21:56.008
Yeah, Leo, I'm crazy!

274
00:21:56.183 --> 00:21:57.774
A loony!

275
00:21:57.951 --> 00:21:59.041
Why?

276
00:21:59.217 --> 00:22:01.547
Why? Oh, I don't know.

277
00:22:01.717 --> 00:22:03.512
'Cause I wanted to redecorate.

278
00:22:03.684 --> 00:22:06.741
A couple of throw pillows,
a TV news reporter.

279
00:22:06.917 --> 00:22:08.543
What do you think?

280
00:22:08.718 --> 00:22:10.547
Raphael, what are you doing?

281
00:22:10.718 --> 00:22:12.684
he got jumped in the subway.

282
00:22:12.852 --> 00:22:15.909
- I had to bring her here.
- It's the news lady.

283
00:22:16.085 --> 00:22:18.142
Can we keep her?

284
00:22:19.452 --> 00:22:21.350
Bring water,
cold washcloth, pillow.

285
00:22:21.519 --> 00:22:22.916
Far out!

286
00:22:47.787 --> 00:22:49.083
Oh, my God!

287
00:22:49.254 --> 00:22:51.516
I'm dead! I'm dead, aren't I?

288
00:22:51.688 --> 00:22:53.517
- It's OK.
- No, I'm dreaming.

289
00:22:53.688 --> 00:22:54.847
I must be dreaming.

290
00:22:55.022 --> 00:22:58.613
Those guys in the black pajamas,
they jumped me.

291
00:22:58.788 --> 00:23:01.515
And that rat... I saw you
in the parking lot.

292
00:23:01.688 --> 00:23:04.882
That explains you.
And you guys...

293
00:23:08.055 --> 00:23:10.681
I have no idea
where you came from.

294
00:23:10.856 --> 00:23:14.618
If you will please just sit down
and calm yourself...

295
00:23:14.789 --> 00:23:17.551
I will tell you
where we came from.

296
00:23:17.722 --> 00:23:19.120
It talks!

297
00:23:19.289 --> 00:23:21.482
It is really quite simple,
Miss O'Neil.

298
00:23:21.656 --> 00:23:26.350
And he knows my name. Perfect.

299
00:23:26.523 --> 00:23:28.648
Fifteen years ago...

300
00:23:28.823 --> 00:23:31.812
Why don't I ever dream of
Harrison Ford?

301
00:23:34.858 --> 00:23:39.313
For 15 years now,
we have lived here.

302
00:23:39.491 --> 00:23:45.981
Before that time, I was a pet
of my master Yoshi...

303
00:23:46.158 --> 00:23:49.886
mimicking his movements
from my cage...

304
00:23:50.058 --> 00:23:53.354
and learning
the secret art of ninja.

305
00:23:54.925 --> 00:23:58.880
When we were forced to come
to New York...

306
00:23:59.059 --> 00:24:02.685
I found myself for the first
time without a home...

307
00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:09.383
<i>wandering the sewers, scavenging
for whatever I could find.</i>

308
00:24:09.559 --> 00:24:11.752
<i>And then, one day...</i>

309
00:24:11.926 --> 00:24:14.722
<i>I came upon
a shattered glass jar...</i>

310
00:24:14.893 --> 00:24:17.189
<i>and four baby turtles.</i>

311
00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:18.883
That was us.

312
00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:20.754
Shut up.

313
00:24:22.261 --> 00:24:27.193
The little ones were crawling
into a strange glowing ooze...

314
00:24:27.361 --> 00:24:30.521
<i>from a broken canister nearby.</i>

315
00:24:31.628 --> 00:24:34.890
<i>I gathered them up
in an old coffee can...</i>

316
00:24:35.062 --> 00:24:37.892
<i>and when
I awoke the next morning...</i>

317
00:24:38.062 --> 00:24:43.222
<i>I received a shock,
for they had doubled in size.</i>

318
00:24:43.396 --> 00:24:47.022
<i>I, too, was growing,
particularly in intellect...</i>

319
00:24:47.195 --> 00:24:50.628
<i>and I was amazed at how
intelligent they seemed.</i>

320
00:24:50.796 --> 00:24:55.525
<i>But nothing could have prepared
me for what happened next.</i>

321
00:24:55.696 --> 00:24:57.526
<i>One of them spoke.</i>

322
00:24:57.697 --> 00:25:00.254
Pizza! Pizza!

323
00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:04.328
<i>More words followed,
and I began their training...</i>

324
00:25:04.497 --> 00:25:08.328
<i>teaching them all that
I had learned from my master.</i>

325
00:25:08.498 --> 00:25:10.464
Radical! Radical! Radical!

326
00:25:10.631 --> 00:25:14.119
And soon
I gave them all names...

327
00:25:14.297 --> 00:25:16.320
Leonardo...

328
00:25:16.498 --> 00:25:18.657
- Michaelangelo...
- That's me.

329
00:25:18.831 --> 00:25:21.263
Donatello...

330
00:25:21.432 --> 00:25:23.125
and Raphael.

331
00:25:27.132 --> 00:25:30.360
I'm not dreaming, am I?

332
00:25:30.532 --> 00:25:32.998
I'm afraid not.

333
00:25:37.466 --> 00:25:41.296
Are you guys sure you
know where you're going?

334
00:25:41.466 --> 00:25:43.796
11th and Bleecker?

335
00:25:43.967 --> 00:25:45.796
Nope. This is only 9th street.

336
00:25:45.967 --> 00:25:47.956
- Get it?
- Yuck.

337
00:26:02.534 --> 00:26:04.932
I'd like
to invite you all in...

338
00:26:05.101 --> 00:26:10.466
but I don't have anything to
offer you except frozen pizza.

339
00:26:10.635 --> 00:26:12.931
Let's go for it!

340
00:26:13.102 --> 00:26:15.590
You said the magic word.

341
00:26:15.769 --> 00:26:18.929
- You guys eat pizza?
- Doesn't everybody?

342
00:26:19.102 --> 00:26:22.694
Well, all right...

343
00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:25.199
Did she say pizza?

344
00:26:25.369 --> 00:26:27.665
So, you live
in an antique store?

345
00:26:27.836 --> 00:26:30.166
- Yep. Pizza!
- Well, above, actually.

346
00:26:30.337 --> 00:26:33.996
What do you guys
like on your pizza?

347
00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:38.569
Just the regular stuff...
flies, stink bugs.

348
00:26:38.737 --> 00:26:41.225
It was a joke.

349
00:26:49.605 --> 00:26:52.435
Maybe I'll fight Apollo,
and maybe I won't, you know?

350
00:26:52.605 --> 00:26:55.332
What do you think? Adrian!

351
00:26:55.505 --> 00:26:57.630
Hey, I got another one!

352
00:26:57.805 --> 00:27:01.329
- This is totally cool!
- Oh, no, not Cagney.

353
00:27:01.506 --> 00:27:06.404
You dirty rat.
You killed my brother.

354
00:27:06.572 --> 00:27:08.061
You dirty rat.

355
00:27:11.606 --> 00:27:13.163
That must be
Splinter's favorite.

356
00:27:19.106 --> 00:27:21.937
It was a joke.

357
00:27:29.673 --> 00:27:33.470
And speaking of which,
we better get going.

358
00:27:33.641 --> 00:27:35.903
He worries.

359
00:27:36.075 --> 00:27:38.802
I don't know what to say.

360
00:27:38.975 --> 00:27:41.203
Will I ever see you guys again?

361
00:27:41.375 --> 00:27:42.398
Indubitably.

362
00:27:42.574 --> 00:27:45.405
That depends on how fast
you stock your pizza.

363
00:27:45.575 --> 00:27:47.404
See you around.

364
00:27:47.575 --> 00:27:49.598
- Bye.
- Later.

365
00:27:55.642 --> 00:27:58.404
No doubt about it.
She loved us!

366
00:27:58.576 --> 00:28:00.041
It was the impressions.

367
00:28:00.209 --> 00:28:01.869
- You wish.
- Hold it.

368
00:28:47.679 --> 00:28:49.009
What's wrong?

369
00:29:10.548 --> 00:29:12.446
Charles Pennington?

370
00:29:12.615 --> 00:29:14.581
<i>Yeah. Who's this?</i>

371
00:29:14.748 --> 00:29:17.180
You got a son
named Danny, Charles?

372
00:29:34.616 --> 00:29:35.946
Who is it?

373
00:29:36.116 --> 00:29:37.446
It's me, Charles.

374
00:29:37.617 --> 00:29:40.412
It's my boss.

375
00:29:40.583 --> 00:29:42.742
Can you guys...

376
00:29:42.917 --> 00:29:43.974
hide?

377
00:29:49.151 --> 00:29:50.810
Charles, what's up?

378
00:29:50.984 --> 00:29:53.314
April... listen.

379
00:29:55.151 --> 00:29:59.584
You have been working
awful hard on this story lately.

380
00:29:59.751 --> 00:30:01.979
Why don't you take it easy
for a while?

381
00:30:04.419 --> 00:30:06.907
Just let somebody else
handle it.

382
00:30:08.152 --> 00:30:10.983
Just for a little while,
you know?

383
00:30:11.153 --> 00:30:13.516
What are you talking about?
It's my story. No way.

384
00:30:13.685 --> 00:30:15.049
Look at you. You're exhausted.

385
00:30:15.219 --> 00:30:17.185
I just had a rough night.

386
00:30:17.353 --> 00:30:20.046
Let somebody else
help you cover City Hall.

387
00:30:20.219 --> 00:30:23.617
Charles, that's ridiculous.
What's with you today?

388
00:30:23.787 --> 00:30:25.117
Nothing's with me today.

389
00:30:25.286 --> 00:30:28.616
I just thought you might like
a little help.

390
00:30:28.787 --> 00:30:32.584
I don't.
Hand me a towel, will you?

391
00:30:32.753 --> 00:30:34.447
Where do you keep the towels?

392
00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:37.450
What's wrong?

393
00:30:37.621 --> 00:30:41.451
I just don't want you to see
my unsightly bathtub ring.

394
00:30:41.621 --> 00:30:43.451
Out, out, out, out.

395
00:30:43.621 --> 00:30:45.451
I have to get ready for work.

396
00:30:45.622 --> 00:30:48.110
Are you sure you won't
reconsider about some help?

397
00:30:48.288 --> 00:30:50.618
Danny, will you tell
your father to relax?

398
00:30:50.789 --> 00:30:52.085
I wish.

399
00:30:53.755 --> 00:30:56.744
Just don't push
any buttons today.

400
00:30:59.922 --> 00:31:01.820
That was close.

401
00:31:01.989 --> 00:31:06.217
Time to switch to decaf, April.

402
00:31:06.389 --> 00:31:07.685
I don't get it, Danny.

403
00:31:07.856 --> 00:31:10.845
I make more than enough money
to provide for both of us...

404
00:31:11.023 --> 00:31:13.182
and you're stealing. Why?

405
00:31:13.357 --> 00:31:15.482
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

406
00:31:15.657 --> 00:31:18.555
What the heck were you doing
with a car stereo anyway?

407
00:31:18.724 --> 00:31:20.121
Or don't you know that either?

408
00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:21.449
- Sorry.
- Sorry?

409
00:31:21.624 --> 00:31:24.647
Not as sorry as you're
going to be after school.

410
00:31:28.458 --> 00:31:29.754
Danny, come back here!

411
00:32:09.927 --> 00:32:13.758
Check it out, man.
Anything you guys want, we got.

412
00:32:13.928 --> 00:32:16.826
Anything you want to do... do it.

413
00:32:16.995 --> 00:32:18.824
Know what I'm saying? Anything.

414
00:32:18.995 --> 00:32:20.756
You got any cigarettes?

415
00:32:22.529 --> 00:32:24.756
Regular or menthol?

416
00:32:32.429 --> 00:32:35.396
Read 'em and weep, boys.
Full house!

417
00:32:44.763 --> 00:32:47.059
Go. Play.

418
00:33:04.365 --> 00:33:05.456
You.

419
00:33:22.132 --> 00:33:23.189
Good.

420
00:33:30.566 --> 00:33:34.192
Never lower your eyes
to an enemy.

421
00:33:34.367 --> 00:33:36.196
Yes, Master Tatsu.

422
00:34:51.039 --> 00:34:52.732
Master Shredder.

423
00:35:34.508 --> 00:35:40.169
Money cannot buy the honor
which you have earned tonight.

424
00:35:44.543 --> 00:35:48.407
You make us all proud.

425
00:35:51.776 --> 00:35:55.902
Only effort,
discipline, loyalty...

426
00:35:56.077 --> 00:35:59.703
Learn the right to wear
the Dragon dogi.

427
00:35:59.877 --> 00:36:04.775
You are here because
the outside world rejects you.

428
00:36:04.944 --> 00:36:07.240
This is your family.

429
00:36:07.411 --> 00:36:11.036
I am your father.

430
00:36:11.211 --> 00:36:17.906
I want you all to become
full members of The Foot.

431
00:36:18.079 --> 00:36:20.874
There is a new enemy...

432
00:36:21.045 --> 00:36:25.705
freaks of nature
who interfere with our business.

433
00:36:25.879 --> 00:36:29.276
You are my eyes and ears.
Find them.

434
00:36:29.446 --> 00:36:34.277
Together we will punish these...

435
00:36:34.447 --> 00:36:37.379
creatures!

436
00:36:37.547 --> 00:36:41.912
These... turtles!

437
00:36:42.081 --> 00:36:43.876
Master.

438
00:36:56.015 --> 00:36:58.310
This is beginning
to sound less and less...

439
00:36:58.481 --> 00:37:00.243
like your common,
garden-variety subway mugging.

440
00:37:00.414 --> 00:37:03.642
Boy, she's a good reporter.

441
00:37:03.815 --> 00:37:05.838
She's a babe!

442
00:37:06.015 --> 00:37:07.572
<i>known as The Foot.</i>

443
00:37:07.749 --> 00:37:09.715
<i>I'm sorry... The Foot?</i>

444
00:37:09.882 --> 00:37:13.336
<i>I know it sounds like a funky
club for podiatrists...</i>

445
00:37:13.515 --> 00:37:15.708
but I've been speaking with
a lot of Japanese-Americans...

446
00:37:15.882 --> 00:37:18.848
in the past few days who say
that our recent crime wave...

447
00:37:19.016 --> 00:37:21.847
is reminiscent of a secret band
of ninja thieves...

448
00:37:22.016 --> 00:37:23.846
who once operated in Japan.

449
00:37:24.017 --> 00:37:26.414
Are the police
looking into this?

450
00:37:26.583 --> 00:37:28.481
I've included everything
in my statement...

451
00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:31.446
<i>but I doubt very much
that Chief Sterns...</i>

452
00:37:31.617 --> 00:37:33.946
<i>is taking this possible
connection seriously.</i>

453
00:37:34.117 --> 00:37:37.106
Well, perhaps
if any of our viewers...

454
00:37:37.284 --> 00:37:38.443
Oh, God.

455
00:37:38.617 --> 00:37:40.708
Mr. Pennington,
Chief Sterns' office.

456
00:37:42.484 --> 00:37:45.315
<i>Pennington, I thought
we had a deal!</i>

457
00:37:45.485 --> 00:37:48.315
You still haven't told us how
you got away from your attacker.

458
00:37:48.485 --> 00:37:51.451
It's really quite incredible.

459
00:37:51.618 --> 00:37:54.778
Some citizens of New York
actually came to my rescue.

460
00:37:54.952 --> 00:37:58.543
<i>Who says everyone in the
Big Apple looks the other way?</i>

461
00:37:58.718 --> 00:38:01.843
<i>Seriously, June, I would like
to take this opportunity...</i>

462
00:38:02.019 --> 00:38:05.281
<i>to thank one of those
individuals in particular.</i>

463
00:38:05.453 --> 00:38:08.248
<i>And if he's watching,
thanks, Raphael.</i>

464
00:38:10.519 --> 00:38:11.542
Studly!

465
00:38:11.719 --> 00:38:14.913
Hey, look.
I think he's blushing.

466
00:38:15.087 --> 00:38:16.678
I am not.

467
00:38:16.853 --> 00:38:18.843
I think he's
actually turning red.

468
00:38:21.187 --> 00:38:23.881
Maybe not.

469
00:38:24.054 --> 00:38:27.145
So what do we do now?

470
00:38:27.321 --> 00:38:29.583
What do you mean,
what do we do now?

471
00:38:29.755 --> 00:38:31.243
Splinter's out there somewhere!

472
00:38:31.421 --> 00:38:32.819
I know Splinter's out there.

473
00:38:32.988 --> 00:38:34.385
- Fight?
- Fight.

474
00:38:34.555 --> 00:38:35.953
- Kitchen?
- Kitchen.

475
00:38:37.155 --> 00:38:38.484
What are we gonna do about it?

476
00:38:38.655 --> 00:38:39.882
What can we do about it?

477
00:38:40.055 --> 00:38:42.385
April's our only link
to these guys.

478
00:38:42.556 --> 00:38:44.919
We have to wait until she
comes up with something.

479
00:38:45.089 --> 00:38:50.681
So that's the plan
from our great leader?

480
00:38:50.856 --> 00:38:52.617
Just sit here on our butts.

481
00:38:52.789 --> 00:38:55.619
I never said
I was a great leader.

482
00:38:55.789 --> 00:38:57.585
Well, you sure
act like it sometimes.

483
00:38:57.757 --> 00:39:01.120
Well, you act like a jerk
sometimes.

484
00:39:01.290 --> 00:39:03.848
And this attitude of yours
isn't helping anything.

485
00:39:04.024 --> 00:39:07.047
Maybe I'll just take
my attitude and leave!

486
00:39:07.224 --> 00:39:08.883
- Why don't you?
- I will!

487
00:39:09.057 --> 00:39:10.886
- Good!
- Great!

488
00:39:11.057 --> 00:39:12.920
Go ahead.
We don't need you!

489
00:39:14.825 --> 00:39:18.848
- Pork rind?
- Pork rind.

490
00:39:19.025 --> 00:39:20.888
Damn!

491
00:40:02.295 --> 00:40:05.193
Move it, will you?

492
00:40:05.361 --> 00:40:06.986
You're letting him
blow right by you!

493
00:40:07.161 --> 00:40:08.990
Can you believe this guy?

494
00:40:09.161 --> 00:40:10.991
Don't just...

495
00:40:11.161 --> 00:40:14.889
Ninja-kick the damn rabbit!
Do something!

496
00:40:15.062 --> 00:40:17.926
April, you were great.

497
00:40:18.096 --> 00:40:19.084
Thanks, Mikey.

498
00:40:19.262 --> 00:40:22.353
he called me Mikey.

499
00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:29.953
- Hear anything yet?
- Not yet.

500
00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:33.255
They're going to repeat the
interview at 5:00 and at 6:00...

501
00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:36.157
and we're going
to have to wait and see...

502
00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:38.819
if it helps generate
any new information.

503
00:40:38.997 --> 00:40:41.155
I told them
to call me here immediately...

504
00:40:41.330 --> 00:40:43.092
if anyone calls the station.

505
00:40:43.264 --> 00:40:45.423
Thanks, April.

506
00:40:45.597 --> 00:40:48.530
We really appreciate,
you know, everything.

507
00:40:48.697 --> 00:40:51.391
Forget it.

508
00:40:53.331 --> 00:40:55.093
Where's Raphael?

509
00:41:00.965 --> 00:41:04.863
I was going to give you guys
a tour of the store.

510
00:41:05.032 --> 00:41:06.623
Shall we go get him?

511
00:41:08.132 --> 00:41:11.496
He just needs
to blow off some steam.

512
00:41:11.666 --> 00:41:16.361
You must be studying the
abridged book of ninja fighting.

513
00:41:30.867 --> 00:41:32.493
I mean, come on.

514
00:41:32.668 --> 00:41:35.657
How do you guys
expect to beat me?

515
00:41:37.968 --> 00:41:40.298
Good answer.

516
00:41:41.534 --> 00:41:45.058
I only keep it open part-time,
mostly for my dad.

517
00:41:45.235 --> 00:41:48.224
He loved junk. I don't know.

518
00:41:48.402 --> 00:41:50.300
I guess it's kind of dumb
to lose money on a business...

519
00:41:50.469 --> 00:41:52.799
just because
you miss your father.

520
00:41:52.969 --> 00:41:54.434
No, it isn't.

521
00:41:56.902 --> 00:41:58.061
Ready?

522
00:42:06.003 --> 00:42:08.128
This place has everything.

523
00:42:08.304 --> 00:42:10.031
Just about.

524
00:42:22.071 --> 00:42:24.264
Hasn't Raph
been gone a long time?

525
00:42:24.438 --> 00:42:27.165
He does it all the time.
He likes it.

526
00:42:29.205 --> 00:42:30.501
Are you sure?

527
00:42:30.672 --> 00:42:33.661
Don't worry. He'll probably
be back any minute.

528
00:42:37.339 --> 00:42:40.827
- Is he...
- No, he's alive... barely.

529
00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:55.928
And I thought
insurance salesmen were pushy.

530
00:42:59.674 --> 00:43:03.436
A fellow chucker, eh?

531
00:43:38.643 --> 00:43:40.074
Keep practicing.

532
00:43:50.077 --> 00:43:51.509
Take that!

533
00:43:57.444 --> 00:44:00.740
One of these guys knows where
they're holding Splinter...

534
00:44:00.911 --> 00:44:03.343
so don't knock them all out.

535
00:44:03.512 --> 00:44:06.501
I don't think
that will be a problem, Leo.

536
00:44:17.413 --> 00:44:18.504
Gotcha.

537
00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:25.143
Hey, Donnie,
Wheel of Fortune, dude.

538
00:44:29.947 --> 00:44:31.538
Bisentos now!

539
00:44:34.147 --> 00:44:36.340
I guess
they're not game show fans.

540
00:44:36.514 --> 00:44:38.878
And I thought
everybody loved Vanna.

541
00:44:43.881 --> 00:44:45.438
California roll!

542
00:44:45.614 --> 00:44:47.604
What a spaz.

543
00:44:47.781 --> 00:44:48.770
Missed again.

544
00:44:48.948 --> 00:44:50.107
Good thing these guys
aren't lumberjacks.

545
00:44:50.281 --> 00:44:51.304
No joke.

546
00:44:51.482 --> 00:44:55.279
The only thing safe
in the woods would be the trees.

547
00:44:57.482 --> 00:45:00.005
Guys, I'm not so sure if this
is, structurally speaking...

548
00:45:00.182 --> 00:45:04.137
such a good time
for your buddies to drop in.

549
00:45:14.383 --> 00:45:16.508
Whoa, wipeout.

550
00:46:07.687 --> 00:46:11.415
Man, we could really use
Raph right about now.

551
00:46:18.955 --> 00:46:20.353
Now what?

552
00:46:24.721 --> 00:46:27.051
You guys mind telling me...

553
00:46:27.222 --> 00:46:30.211
what you're doing to
my little green pal over there?

554
00:46:32.156 --> 00:46:34.883
Who is the babe?

555
00:46:35.056 --> 00:46:37.352
Who the heck is that?

556
00:46:37.523 --> 00:46:40.717
Wayne Gretzky on steroids?

557
00:46:40.889 --> 00:46:43.082
Attack!

558
00:46:59.724 --> 00:47:02.190
We got to get out of here.

559
00:47:08.258 --> 00:47:11.418
Help me. There used to be
a trapdoor here to the basement.

560
00:47:11.592 --> 00:47:14.581
Come on, you all! Three more!

561
00:47:16.359 --> 00:47:18.382
We're getting out of here.

562
00:47:21.326 --> 00:47:24.759
Get away, man.
I'll take care of these guys.

563
00:47:26.993 --> 00:47:27.890
You coming?

564
00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:30.083
I'll cover you.

565
00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:31.691
Good idea.

566
00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:38.649
<i>Hi, this is April.
Leave a message after the beep.</i>

567
00:47:39.927 --> 00:47:41.688
<i>April, it's Charles.</i>

568
00:47:41.861 --> 00:47:44.191
<i>I'm sorry. I don't know
how else to say this.</i>

569
00:47:44.361 --> 00:47:45.690
<i>You're fired, April.</i>

570
00:47:45.861 --> 00:47:48.986
<i>I'm sorry.
I know this comes as a blow.</i>

571
00:47:50.528 --> 00:47:51.687
You can say that again, Chuck.

572
00:47:51.862 --> 00:47:53.384
Come on!

573
00:47:53.561 --> 00:47:55.550
Bye, guys. Got to run.

574
00:47:59.295 --> 00:48:00.954
Ninja, vanish.

575
00:48:42.731 --> 00:48:46.824
What are these... freaks?

576
00:48:46.998 --> 00:48:50.487
How do they know how
to fight like this?

577
00:48:52.799 --> 00:48:55.788
You will answer.

578
00:48:57.632 --> 00:49:00.599
Then hang there until you die.

579
00:49:35.768 --> 00:49:37.098
Master Tatsu, stop, please.

580
00:49:37.269 --> 00:49:38.996
Please, stop it.

581
00:49:45.970 --> 00:49:46.958
Shinsho.

582
00:49:51.370 --> 00:49:54.097
You'll be all right.

583
00:50:13.705 --> 00:50:18.831
How can a face so young
wear so many burdens?

584
00:50:19.005 --> 00:50:21.164
So, you can talk.

585
00:50:21.339 --> 00:50:25.704
Yes, and I can also listen.

586
00:50:27.072 --> 00:50:30.835
Some say that the path
from inner turmoil...

587
00:50:31.006 --> 00:50:34.938
begins with a friendly ear.

588
00:50:35.106 --> 00:50:39.835
My ear is open
if you care to use it.

589
00:50:40.006 --> 00:50:41.939
I don't think so.

590
00:50:42.106 --> 00:50:44.130
What is your name?

591
00:50:46.807 --> 00:50:50.933
And have you no one to go to,
Danny? No parent?

592
00:50:51.107 --> 00:50:53.539
My dad couldn't
care less about me.

593
00:50:53.708 --> 00:50:57.072
I doubt that is true.

594
00:50:58.307 --> 00:50:59.637
Why?

595
00:51:01.308 --> 00:51:06.104
All fathers care for their sons.

596
00:51:16.042 --> 00:51:18.803
- How's Raphael?
- Not so good.

597
00:51:18.976 --> 00:51:21.602
Didn't they use this place
in The <i>Grapes</i> of Wrath?

598
00:51:21.776 --> 00:51:23.742
Very funny.

599
00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:27.933
I told you, I haven't been
up here in years.

600
00:51:34.210 --> 00:51:35.699
Can you fix it?

601
00:51:42.111 --> 00:51:43.440
Does that answer your question?

602
00:51:43.611 --> 00:51:47.100
The block's got a crack
the size of the an Andreas.

603
00:51:47.278 --> 00:51:49.141
Wonderful.

604
00:51:49.311 --> 00:51:52.141
I guess
I've got some walking to do.

605
00:51:52.311 --> 00:51:53.868
What for?

606
00:51:54.045 --> 00:51:56.875
Our nearest neighbor
is about four miles away.

607
00:51:57.045 --> 00:51:59.875
I need to get to a phone,
and I need to call my boss.

608
00:52:00.045 --> 00:52:01.170
You mean Charles?

609
00:52:01.346 --> 00:52:02.834
How did you know that?

610
00:52:03.012 --> 00:52:05.979
He left a message on your
machine just before we got out.

611
00:52:08.446 --> 00:52:12.277
You just saved yourself
an eight-mile round-tripper.

612
00:52:12.447 --> 00:52:14.436
You were fired.

613
00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:19.336
I just saved myself...

614
00:52:19.514 --> 00:52:23.174
Did you take classes
in insensitivity?

615
00:52:23.347 --> 00:52:25.211
I was just trying
to break it to you easy.

616
00:52:25.381 --> 00:52:27.006
Oh, well you failed miserably!

617
00:52:27.181 --> 00:52:30.079
Broadzilla, you wouldn't be
here if it weren't for me.

618
00:52:30.248 --> 00:52:32.840
And what do you want?
Do you want a thank you?

619
00:52:33.014 --> 00:52:36.140
It's me who should thank you
for that privilege, right?

620
00:52:36.314 --> 00:52:37.144
Fine!

621
00:52:37.314 --> 00:52:39.144
Thank you.

622
00:52:39.315 --> 00:52:40.440
You're welcome!

623
00:52:42.048 --> 00:52:47.481
<i>It's kind of like Moonlighting,
isn't it?</i>

624
00:52:58.316 --> 00:53:00.748
<i>It's strange being back
on the old farm.</i>

625
00:53:00.917 --> 00:53:04.815
<i>Even after all these years,
it still feels like home.</i>

626
00:53:04.984 --> 00:53:06.950
<i>My amazing new friends...</i>

627
00:53:07.117 --> 00:53:09.208
<i>have suffered
their first real defeat.</i>

628
00:53:09.384 --> 00:53:13.214
<i>That's bad enough, but they've
also lost the opportunity...</i>

629
00:53:13.384 --> 00:53:15.213
<i>to find out
about their mentor...</i>

630
00:53:15.384 --> 00:53:18.214
<i>and I'm sure that hurts them
more than anything else.</i>

631
00:53:18.384 --> 00:53:21.714
<i>Each of them deals with
this confusion in his own way.</i>

632
00:53:21.885 --> 00:53:24.715
<i>Donatello has found
someone to latch onto.</i>

633
00:53:24.885 --> 00:53:27.942
Not even close, zip neck.

634
00:53:28.118 --> 00:53:31.108
The Professor and Mary Ann,
happily ever after.

635
00:53:31.285 --> 00:53:35.184
No way, atomic mouth.
Gilligan was her main man.

636
00:53:35.353 --> 00:53:37.716
They'd be married
and have six kids by now.

637
00:53:37.886 --> 00:53:40.148
Gilligan was a geek,
barfarooni!

638
00:53:40.319 --> 00:53:42.148
You're the geek, camel breath.

639
00:53:42.319 --> 00:53:43.751
Dome head.

640
00:53:45.153 --> 00:53:46.551
Elf lips.

641
00:53:48.820 --> 00:53:50.649
Let's give this a try.

642
00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:53.150
See if this transplant
worked... fungoid.

643
00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:55.650
Here goes. What are we on?

644
00:53:55.821 --> 00:53:57.184
"G."

645
00:53:57.354 --> 00:53:59.547
Here goes, gack face.

646
00:53:59.721 --> 00:54:01.516
I'm ready, hose brain.

647
00:54:09.921 --> 00:54:12.285
It worked.

648
00:54:13.989 --> 00:54:19.012
<i>Leonardo, meanwhile, has kept
a constant vigil with Raphael.</i>

649
00:54:54.491 --> 00:54:56.354
He'll be OK.

650
00:55:02.025 --> 00:55:03.854
<i>And then there's Casey Jones...</i>

651
00:55:04.025 --> 00:55:06.719
<i>a nine-year-old
trapped in a man's body.</i>

652
00:55:06.893 --> 00:55:10.256
<i>He might almost be cute if it
wasn't for that pigheadedness.</i>

653
00:55:13.093 --> 00:55:16.218
He's out with the others,
exercising.

654
00:55:16.393 --> 00:55:19.223
Doing something together,
I don't know.

655
00:55:19.393 --> 00:55:20.882
Want some help?

656
00:55:22.426 --> 00:55:23.756
I don't know.

657
00:55:23.927 --> 00:55:27.257
I am your man.
I am Mr. Fix-it.

658
00:55:27.426 --> 00:55:28.756
Let's go.

659
00:55:28.927 --> 00:55:30.416
Lead the way, toots.

660
00:55:32.528 --> 00:55:33.585
Toots?

661
00:55:33.761 --> 00:55:35.989
Babe?

662
00:55:37.028 --> 00:55:38.016
Sweetcakes?

663
00:55:39.294 --> 00:55:40.885
Princess!

664
00:55:41.061 --> 00:55:44.550
Do you want to throw me a clue
here? I'm drowning.

665
00:55:44.728 --> 00:55:46.752
You know what? That's OK.

666
00:55:46.928 --> 00:55:48.622
I'll take care of it myself.

667
00:55:48.795 --> 00:55:50.124
That's up to you.

668
00:55:50.295 --> 00:55:52.955
Just don't come around here
asking for my help anymore.

669
00:55:53.129 --> 00:55:54.651
I wouldn't
ask for your help...

670
00:55:54.829 --> 00:55:59.921
if you were the last thing
on the face of this planet.

671
00:56:00.096 --> 00:56:01.722
It's coming along nicely.

672
00:56:10.264 --> 00:56:11.355
What?

673
00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:17.895
You're awake!
How do you feel?

674
00:56:18.063 --> 00:56:22.292
What's a guy got to do to get
some food around here?

675
00:56:23.597 --> 00:56:24.722
He's awake!

676
00:56:24.898 --> 00:56:28.921
He wants some food!
Bring some food!

677
00:56:29.098 --> 00:56:31.587
You're going to be OK, Raph.

678
00:56:35.431 --> 00:56:37.421
Get a grip, will you?

679
00:56:37.598 --> 00:56:39.326
Listen, Raph...

680
00:56:40.932 --> 00:56:42.989
About what I said before...

681
00:56:45.065 --> 00:56:48.055
About not needing you and all...

682
00:56:49.633 --> 00:56:52.724
Leo, don't.

683
00:56:53.733 --> 00:56:55.597
Oh, boy, we missed you.

684
00:56:55.766 --> 00:56:58.858
It's a Kodak moment.

685
00:57:06.468 --> 00:57:09.628
<i>The Turtles are four
once again...</i>

686
00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:11.858
<i>and yet, still not whole.</i>

687
00:57:12.967 --> 00:57:15.490
<i>A lingering doubt remains...</i>

688
00:57:15.668 --> 00:57:18.361
<i>an unknown which
they can't bear to face...</i>

689
00:57:18.535 --> 00:57:20.694
<i>their greatest fear.</i>

690
00:57:29.202 --> 00:57:33.295
Your empire flourishes,
Master Shredder.

691
00:57:33.469 --> 00:57:35.299
What more from the rat?

692
00:57:35.470 --> 00:57:38.300
Nothing. It will not speak.

693
00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:41.800
And the boy
who led us to the turtles?

694
00:57:41.970 --> 00:57:43.799
He is still missing.

695
00:57:43.970 --> 00:57:45.959
I do not understand.

696
00:57:46.137 --> 00:57:48.967
Why do the turtles
trouble you, Master?

697
00:57:49.137 --> 00:57:52.297
They have not been seen
for many days.

698
00:57:52.471 --> 00:57:57.802
Something about the way you
described their fighting...

699
00:57:57.971 --> 00:58:00.096
something familiar.

700
00:58:02.305 --> 00:58:08.135
Something... from the past.

701
00:59:17.110 --> 00:59:19.076
Ointment?

702
00:59:28.278 --> 00:59:30.267
Funny, Mikey.

703
00:59:56.746 --> 01:00:00.907
What Russian novel, embracing
more than 500 characters...

704
01:00:01.079 --> 01:00:03.272
is set in the Napoleonic Wars?

705
01:00:03.446 --> 01:00:04.742
<i>War and Peace.</i>

706
01:00:04.914 --> 01:00:05.811
He's alive!

707
01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:07.605
Thanks, spaz.

708
01:00:07.780 --> 01:00:09.246
Splinter's alive!

709
01:00:09.414 --> 01:00:12.209
We know, Leo. Of course he is.

710
01:00:12.381 --> 01:00:14.210
We all think he's alive.

711
01:00:14.381 --> 01:00:15.608
I don't think.

712
01:00:15.781 --> 01:00:17.838
I know.

713
01:00:24.382 --> 01:00:29.440
Leo, if you dragged us
out here for nothing...

714
01:00:29.615 --> 01:00:32.081
Don't worry. I came prepared.

715
01:00:32.248 --> 01:00:33.612
Put those away.

716
01:00:36.549 --> 01:00:39.482
Everybody close your eyes
and concentrate.

717
01:00:40.483 --> 01:00:42.472
Concentrate hard.

718
01:01:08.851 --> 01:01:12.841
<i>I am proud of you, my sons.</i>

719
01:01:13.019 --> 01:01:15.348
<i>Tonight you have learned...</i>

720
01:01:15.518 --> 01:01:20.349
<i>the final and greatest truth
of the ninja...</i>

721
01:01:20.519 --> 01:01:25.577
<i>that ultimate mastery comes
not of the body...</i>

722
01:01:25.753 --> 01:01:28.514
<i>but of the mind.</i>

723
01:01:28.686 --> 01:01:30.652
<i>Together, there is nothing...</i>

724
01:01:30.819 --> 01:01:33.979
<i>your four minds
cannot accomplish.</i>

725
01:01:34.153 --> 01:01:37.983
<i>Help each other.
Draw upon one another.</i>

726
01:01:38.153 --> 01:01:44.144
<i>And always remember
the true force that binds you...</i>

727
01:01:44.321 --> 01:01:48.980
<i>the same as that which
brought me here tonight...</i>

728
01:01:49.154 --> 01:01:54.553
<i>that which I gladly return
with my final words.</i>

729
01:01:55.721 --> 01:01:59.653
<i>I love you all, my sons.</i>

730
01:02:37.457 --> 01:02:39.253
So you actually
played professionally?

731
01:02:39.424 --> 01:02:41.254
Before I got hurt.

732
01:02:41.424 --> 01:02:43.118
Less than a year.

733
01:02:45.125 --> 01:02:46.421
I'm sorry.

734
01:02:46.592 --> 01:02:48.319
So was I.

735
01:02:50.592 --> 01:02:51.956
Just a minute.

736
01:02:52.126 --> 01:02:53.489
Guys, I told you...

737
01:02:53.659 --> 01:02:56.819
I hate it when
you do that, all right?

738
01:02:56.992 --> 01:02:58.481
What is it?

739
01:02:59.759 --> 01:03:01.749
It's time to go back.

740
01:03:26.595 --> 01:03:27.753
Home sweet home.

741
01:03:29.595 --> 01:03:32.891
Now I know what it's like
to travel without a green card.

742
01:03:33.062 --> 01:03:34.925
This isn't bad.
Nice place, guys.

743
01:03:37.296 --> 01:03:39.057
You coming or not, dude?

744
01:03:44.429 --> 01:03:45.622
This is great.

745
01:03:45.796 --> 01:03:48.853
First, it's the farm
that time forgot, and now this.

746
01:03:49.030 --> 01:03:52.792
Why don't I ever fall in
with people who own condos?

747
01:03:52.963 --> 01:03:56.361
Guess it's hard to get
good maid service in a sewer.

748
01:03:56.530 --> 01:03:59.018
Maybe you guys should try
Roto-rooter.

749
01:03:59.197 --> 01:04:02.357
Would you quit complaining?
It's just for the night.

750
01:04:02.530 --> 01:04:05.860
I still don't see why we don't
get started right away.

751
01:04:06.031 --> 01:04:07.690
It's been a long drive, Raph...

752
01:04:07.864 --> 01:04:10.695
and before we go out advertising
to The Foot that we're back...

753
01:04:10.864 --> 01:04:13.262
we could all use
a few hours' sleep.

754
01:04:13.431 --> 01:04:15.420
You're right. I'm just...

755
01:04:15.598 --> 01:04:16.586
What's that?

756
01:04:20.232 --> 01:04:21.595
Don't shoot!

757
01:04:21.765 --> 01:04:23.754
I don't think it's loaded, kid.

758
01:04:23.932 --> 01:04:25.921
Danny, what are you doing here?

759
01:04:26.098 --> 01:04:28.326
- Hey, where'd he come from?
- Beats me.

760
01:04:28.499 --> 01:04:30.328
I ran away from home.

761
01:04:30.499 --> 01:04:33.659
Your father's
going to have kittens.

762
01:04:33.832 --> 01:04:34.991
Does this thing work?

763
01:04:36.899 --> 01:04:38.058
Please don't call.

764
01:04:38.233 --> 01:04:39.926
Just let me stay here
the night with you.

765
01:04:40.099 --> 01:04:41.497
We can call in the morning.
I promise.

766
01:04:41.667 --> 01:04:42.496
Danny, listen...

767
01:04:42.667 --> 01:04:43.997
Hold on.

768
01:04:44.167 --> 01:04:49.190
What is all this talk about
spending the night down here?

769
01:04:49.367 --> 01:04:51.629
You're a claustrophobic.

770
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.159
Do you want a fist in the mouth?

771
01:04:56.601 --> 01:04:59.431
I've never even looked
at another guy before.

772
01:04:59.601 --> 01:05:03.295
What he means is that you're
afraid of enclosed areas.

773
01:05:03.468 --> 01:05:04.559
Afraid?

774
01:05:06.801 --> 01:05:10.928
What, me?
Is that what you think?

775
01:05:11.101 --> 01:05:15.125
I don't have to take
this stuff about being afraid.

776
01:05:18.635 --> 01:05:21.124
I'm going to sleep in the truck.

777
01:05:29.304 --> 01:05:31.929
These are good.

778
01:05:32.937 --> 01:05:35.768
Do you think
maybe I could have one?

779
01:05:35.937 --> 01:05:38.267
Sure. Why not?

780
01:05:38.437 --> 01:05:39.596
I could really go...

781
01:05:39.771 --> 01:05:42.101
for a little deep-dish action
right about now.

782
01:05:42.271 --> 01:05:44.464
I had some pizza down here
the other day.

783
01:05:44.637 --> 01:05:46.660
There might be some left over.

784
01:05:51.505 --> 01:05:54.335
- Well?
- Question.

785
01:05:54.505 --> 01:05:57.494
Do you like penicillin
on your pizza?

786
01:06:11.406 --> 01:06:13.270
"Afraid of enclosed areas."

787
01:06:41.008 --> 01:06:45.997
<i>You are here because
the outside world rejects you.</i>

788
01:06:46.175 --> 01:06:49.608
<i>And you have
no one to go to, Danny?</i>

789
01:06:49.776 --> 01:06:51.264
<i>This is your family.</i>

790
01:06:51.442 --> 01:06:55.205
<i>All fathers
care for their sons.</i>

791
01:08:05.281 --> 01:08:06.769
Look out, man.

792
01:08:32.116 --> 01:08:35.775
I have not seen you for days.

793
01:08:35.950 --> 01:08:40.576
I've been down
at my hideout a lot lately.

794
01:08:40.750 --> 01:08:45.580
And do you now hide from
your surrogate family as well?

795
01:08:48.585 --> 01:08:50.414
I don't know.

796
01:08:50.585 --> 01:08:54.984
I, too, once
had a family, Danny.

797
01:08:56.251 --> 01:09:00.581
Many years ago,
I lived in Japan...

798
01:09:00.751 --> 01:09:03.740
a pet of my master Yoshi...

799
01:09:03.918 --> 01:09:06.680
<i>mimicking his movements
from my cage...</i>

800
01:09:06.852 --> 01:09:11.409
<i>and learning the mysterious art
of ninjitsu.</i>

801
01:09:11.586 --> 01:09:16.417
<i>For Yoshi was one of Japan's
finest shadow warriors.</i>

802
01:09:16.587 --> 01:09:22.281
His only rival was a man
named Oruku Saki...

803
01:09:22.453 --> 01:09:25.544
and they competed
in all things...

804
01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:30.880
<i>but none more fiercely
than for the love of a woman...</i>

805
01:09:31.054 --> 01:09:33.145
<i>Tang Shen.</i>

806
01:09:34.721 --> 01:09:37.551
<i>Shen's love
was only for my master...</i>

807
01:09:37.721 --> 01:09:41.551
and rather than see him fight
Saki for her hand...

808
01:09:41.721 --> 01:09:45.881
she persuaded Yoshi
to flee with me to America.

809
01:09:46.055 --> 01:09:48.544
But Saki vowed vengeance.

810
01:09:48.722 --> 01:09:53.677
<i>I remember it well
as my master returned home...</i>

811
01:09:53.855 --> 01:09:57.685
<i>to find his beloved Shen
lying on the floor.</i>

812
01:09:57.855 --> 01:10:00.378
<i>And then he saw her killer.</i>

813
01:10:00.556 --> 01:10:04.044
<i>Saki wasted no words,
and during the struggle...</i>

814
01:10:04.223 --> 01:10:05.655
<i>my cage was broken.</i>

815
01:10:05.823 --> 01:10:09.187
<i>I leapt to Saki's face,
biting and clawing...</i>

816
01:10:09.357 --> 01:10:11.084
<i>but he threw me to the floor...</i>

817
01:10:11.257 --> 01:10:14.916
and took one swipe with
his katana, slicing my ear.

818
01:10:16.357 --> 01:10:19.755
<i>Then he was gone,
and I was alone.</i>

819
01:10:22.691 --> 01:10:26.680
Whatever happened
to this Oruku Saki?

820
01:10:27.857 --> 01:10:30.483
No one really knows.

821
01:10:30.658 --> 01:10:34.988
But you wear his symbol
upon your brow.

822
01:11:06.627 --> 01:11:08.957
What are you
doing in there, boy?

823
01:11:09.127 --> 01:11:10.616
Nothing.

824
01:11:20.462 --> 01:11:22.189
Where have you been?

825
01:11:22.362 --> 01:11:24.953
Nowhere.

826
01:11:25.128 --> 01:11:27.458
You're lying to me.

827
01:11:27.629 --> 01:11:30.652
And you're hiding
something as well.

828
01:11:56.931 --> 01:11:58.590
They're back!

829
01:12:02.664 --> 01:12:04.597
Master.

830
01:12:04.764 --> 01:12:07.560
There will be
no mistake this time.

831
01:12:07.732 --> 01:12:09.755
I go myself.

832
01:12:09.932 --> 01:12:11.795
And the rat...

833
01:12:11.966 --> 01:12:13.522
kill it.

834
01:12:21.132 --> 01:12:22.927
What do you want?

835
01:12:23.099 --> 01:12:24.588
Recognize me now, kid?

836
01:12:24.766 --> 01:12:26.459
What's the deal?

837
01:12:26.633 --> 01:12:27.530
You got to come with me!

838
01:12:27.700 --> 01:12:29.132
What are you talking about,
come with you?

839
01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:31.289
They're going to kill Splinter.

840
01:13:18.270 --> 01:13:20.259
No sweat.

841
01:13:21.770 --> 01:13:24.759
I do hope
there's more of them.

842
01:13:31.404 --> 01:13:32.563
Good!

843
01:13:41.771 --> 01:13:43.760
Where are the keys?

844
01:13:46.906 --> 01:13:49.394
Who are you?

845
01:13:52.739 --> 01:13:54.728
The name's Casey Jones.

846
01:13:57.406 --> 01:13:58.894
A friend.

847
01:14:04.074 --> 01:14:06.403
Let's get out of here.

848
01:14:25.141 --> 01:14:26.539
A little to the right...
A little to the left.

849
01:14:26.709 --> 01:14:28.538
One more time.

850
01:14:28.709 --> 01:14:30.538
A little bit
more like... that!

851
01:14:30.709 --> 01:14:32.902
And stop. Perfect.

852
01:14:34.875 --> 01:14:36.864
You're a natural, sis.

853
01:14:46.176 --> 01:14:51.235
A little Primatene might just
help to clear that up there.

854
01:14:53.843 --> 01:14:56.139
That's going to cost you,
Tinkerbell.

855
01:14:57.844 --> 01:15:00.742
I don't think
that you're listening.

856
01:15:06.844 --> 01:15:09.174
You know,
I'm starting to pick up...

857
01:15:09.345 --> 01:15:12.505
on a little language barrier
thing going here.

858
01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:35.541
Fore!

859
01:15:44.647 --> 01:15:47.636
I'll never call golf
a dull game again.

860
01:15:53.314 --> 01:15:54.302
Gangway!

861
01:16:07.115 --> 01:16:08.581
Show-off!

862
01:16:10.116 --> 01:16:13.139
What are we just standing
here for? Let's get him!

863
01:16:14.782 --> 01:16:17.248
Do you want to be first, Junior?

864
01:16:18.250 --> 01:16:20.341
We have a loyalty
to The Shredder.

865
01:16:20.516 --> 01:16:22.345
The Shredder uses you.

866
01:16:22.516 --> 01:16:27.176
He poisons your minds to obtain
that which he desires.

867
01:16:29.117 --> 01:16:33.072
He cares nothing for you
or the people you hurt.

868
01:16:35.117 --> 01:16:36.606
We're a family.

869
01:16:38.217 --> 01:16:42.082
Family? Is that what you said?

870
01:16:42.252 --> 01:16:48.310
You call this here
and that down there "family"?

871
01:17:25.621 --> 01:17:27.985
Hey, dudes, where you going?

872
01:17:29.355 --> 01:17:33.310
Donnie, looks like this one's
suffering from shell shock.

873
01:17:33.488 --> 01:17:35.283
Too derivative.

874
01:17:37.256 --> 01:17:39.484
Boy, I guess we can
really shell it out.

875
01:17:39.655 --> 01:17:41.485
Too cliche.

876
01:17:41.656 --> 01:17:45.520
Well, it was
a shell of a good hit.

877
01:17:45.689 --> 01:17:47.985
<i>I</i> like it. Step up.

878
01:17:49.789 --> 01:17:51.187
Awesome!

879
01:17:54.457 --> 01:17:57.423
Where do you think you're going?

880
01:18:03.091 --> 01:18:05.818
Wait for me!

881
01:18:08.491 --> 01:18:11.480
God, I love being a turtle!

882
01:18:56.961 --> 01:18:58.517
Aw, no more?

883
01:19:12.962 --> 01:19:17.792
Does anybody have any idea
about who or what this is?

884
01:19:17.962 --> 01:19:19.053
I don't know...

885
01:19:19.229 --> 01:19:22.195
but I'll bet it never has
to look for a can opener.

886
01:19:22.363 --> 01:19:26.386
You fight well
in the old style...

887
01:19:26.563 --> 01:19:30.018
but you've caused me
enough trouble.

888
01:19:30.197 --> 01:19:33.186
Now you face...

889
01:19:33.364 --> 01:19:35.159
The Shredder.

890
01:19:37.664 --> 01:19:40.789
Maybe all that hardware's
for making coleslaw.

891
01:19:40.964 --> 01:19:43.021
I got him.

892
01:19:48.431 --> 01:19:49.761
This guy's good.

893
01:19:49.931 --> 01:19:52.420
Why don't you go next?

894
01:19:58.999 --> 01:20:00.158
Match you for it?

895
01:20:03.299 --> 01:20:05.288
Damn. Great.

896
01:20:07.933 --> 01:20:09.592
Come on.

897
01:20:16.734 --> 01:20:18.723
So much for family.

898
01:20:23.867 --> 01:20:28.300
Now... at exactly what point...

899
01:20:28.468 --> 01:20:30.525
did we lose control here?

900
01:20:30.701 --> 01:20:35.190
Maybe somebody ought to tell
him that we're the good guys.

901
01:20:35.368 --> 01:20:36.356
Any thoughts?

902
01:20:36.534 --> 01:20:38.194
I've only got one thought.

903
01:20:38.368 --> 01:20:41.062
This guy knows
where Splinter is.

904
01:20:45.469 --> 01:20:49.231
Looks like your boys are
going to need a little...

905
01:20:49.402 --> 01:20:51.868
Where did he go?

906
01:21:12.837 --> 01:21:14.098
Leftovers.

907
01:21:42.506 --> 01:21:43.733
It's a talent.

908
01:22:00.340 --> 01:22:02.636
Where's Splinter?

909
01:22:02.807 --> 01:22:04.830
Ah, the rat.

910
01:22:05.008 --> 01:22:07.304
So it has a name.

911
01:22:07.475 --> 01:22:10.737
It had a name.

912
01:22:12.441 --> 01:22:14.373
You lie!

913
01:22:15.575 --> 01:22:17.303
Do I?

914
01:22:25.643 --> 01:22:27.404
He dies.

915
01:22:28.542 --> 01:22:29.838
Weapons.

916
01:22:33.043 --> 01:22:34.202
Now!

917
01:22:43.543 --> 01:22:45.100
Fools.

918
01:22:45.278 --> 01:22:48.005
The three of you
might have overpowered me...

919
01:22:48.177 --> 01:22:50.439
with the loss of but one.

920
01:22:50.611 --> 01:22:55.202
Now your fate will be his!

921
01:23:03.345 --> 01:23:08.403
Yes, Oruku Saki,
I know who you are.

922
01:23:08.579 --> 01:23:12.375
We met many years ago...

923
01:23:12.545 --> 01:23:17.274
in the home of my master...
Hamato Yoshi.

924
01:23:23.580 --> 01:23:25.739
It's him.

925
01:23:30.514 --> 01:23:35.742
Now I will finish
what I began with your ear.

926
01:23:48.115 --> 01:23:52.673
Death comes for us all,
Oruku Saki...

927
01:23:52.849 --> 01:23:55.940
but something much worse
comes for you.

928
01:23:56.116 --> 01:23:58.412
For when you die, it will be...

929
01:24:08.316 --> 01:24:10.714
Without honor.

930
01:24:22.484 --> 01:24:24.473
Splinter, are you OK?

931
01:24:26.984 --> 01:24:29.212
We were so worried.

932
01:24:29.385 --> 01:24:30.681
Kids.

933
01:24:58.887 --> 01:25:00.750
All right, guys,
let's get to it.

934
01:25:05.887 --> 01:25:08.445
April, here.

935
01:25:09.454 --> 01:25:11.386
What's this for?

936
01:25:11.554 --> 01:25:13.417
It's something I owe you.

937
01:25:13.588 --> 01:25:14.576
Trust me.

938
01:25:18.222 --> 01:25:19.687
Dad!

939
01:25:23.955 --> 01:25:25.785
Where have you been?

940
01:25:25.955 --> 01:25:28.547
I've had the whole city
looking for you.

941
01:25:28.722 --> 01:25:31.210
Are you all right?

942
01:25:31.389 --> 01:25:33.253
It's OK, Dad. I'm OK, really.

943
01:25:33.422 --> 01:25:36.287
And, Dad?

944
01:25:36.456 --> 01:25:39.445
It's just Dan now, OK?

945
01:25:42.140 --> 01:25:42.725
Dan?

946
01:25:48.257 --> 01:25:49.484
What have you been up to, freak?

947
01:25:49.657 --> 01:25:51.453
I want some stretchers in here.
Get some doctors.

948
01:25:51.624 --> 01:25:52.612
On the sidewalk. Don't move.

949
01:25:52.790 --> 01:25:53.779
Get those kids over there.

950
01:25:53.957 --> 01:25:55.514
Don't let them get away.
I want to talk to them.

951
01:25:55.691 --> 01:25:58.987
April, I told you
there were circumstances.

952
01:25:59.158 --> 01:26:01.817
I really need you to cover this.

953
01:26:01.991 --> 01:26:03.321
I don't know, Charles.

954
01:26:03.492 --> 01:26:06.481
Did you know that May Williams
over at Channel Five...

955
01:26:06.659 --> 01:26:08.147
has her own office?

956
01:26:08.325 --> 01:26:09.621
You can have an office.

957
01:26:09.792 --> 01:26:11.781
She has her own corner office.

958
01:26:11.959 --> 01:26:13.515
You can have a corner office.

959
01:26:13.692 --> 01:26:16.487
But she's also one of the
highest-paid field reporters...

960
01:26:16.659 --> 01:26:17.818
in New York City.

961
01:26:17.992 --> 01:26:19.322
Now you are.

962
01:26:22.693 --> 01:26:25.488
You are a tough negotiator,
Charles.

963
01:26:26.826 --> 01:26:29.349
I want some answers.

964
01:26:29.526 --> 01:26:34.152
What in God's name
happened out here tonight?

965
01:26:34.327 --> 01:26:36.918
Somebody better talk to me.

966
01:26:39.193 --> 01:26:42.126
Go check out the east warehouse
over at Lairdman Island.

967
01:26:42.294 --> 01:26:44.193
You'll get your answers there.

968
01:26:49.194 --> 01:26:50.217
Let's go.

969
01:26:53.328 --> 01:26:56.488
I've been looking
all over for you.

970
01:26:56.662 --> 01:26:58.560
Casey, hi.

971
01:26:58.728 --> 01:26:59.853
"Hi"?

972
01:27:01.895 --> 01:27:06.123
I look like I just called
Mike Tyson a sissy.

973
01:27:07.629 --> 01:27:09.618
And all you just say is hi?

974
01:27:09.796 --> 01:27:14.491
You don't need
an ambulance, do you?

975
01:27:14.663 --> 01:27:16.925
No, but... I was...

976
01:27:17.096 --> 01:27:18.392
Will you just shut up
and kiss me?

977
01:27:18.563 --> 01:27:20.119
I got a report to do.

978
01:27:22.930 --> 01:27:24.260
I love it when you're pushy.

979
01:27:29.197 --> 01:27:32.789
9.95!

980
01:27:37.298 --> 01:27:39.026
That's the way to go!

981
01:27:39.198 --> 01:27:41.823
We were awesome!

982
01:27:41.998 --> 01:27:44.759
Bodacious!

983
01:27:44.931 --> 01:27:47.124
Bitchin'.

984
01:27:48.932 --> 01:27:50.864
Gnarly.

985
01:27:51.033 --> 01:27:52.828
Radical.

986
01:27:53.832 --> 01:27:55.162
Totally tubular, dude.

987
01:27:55.333 --> 01:27:57.492
Wicked!

988
01:27:57.666 --> 01:27:59.496
Hellacious!

989
01:27:59.667 --> 01:28:01.860
Uh, mega...

990
01:28:02.933 --> 01:28:06.093
I have always liked...

991
01:28:08.733 --> 01:28:10.461
Cowabunga.

992
01:28:17.167 --> 01:28:19.134
I made a funny.
