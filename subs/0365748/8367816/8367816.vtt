It's just with Ed here, it's no wonder
I always bring my flatmates out,

13

exacerbates things.

-Well, you guys hardly get on, do you?

-It means to make things worse.

spend time with you, 'cause I do.

20
00:01:56.032 --> 00:01:59.035

have too many friends.

do more interesting stuff.

-Not yet.

Don't you get along
with your mum, Shaun?

39

No. It's not that I
don't get on with her...

Feel free to step in any time!

00:58:59.953 --> 00:59:02.497
-You did all right.
-I didn't want to cramp your style.

1001
00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:04.874
-Why?
-I'm so sorry about that.

1002
00:59:07.085 --> 00:59:08.461
Right.

1003
00:59:10.672 --> 00:59:14.509
Okay, everyone just stay where they
are. I'm gonna check if the coast is clear.

1004
00:59:24.018 --> 00:59:26.146
-Is it clear?
-No.

-LIZ: How many?
-Lots.

1006

Oh, well, that is just great.

1007
00:59:41.661 --> 00:59:43.538
There are a fair
few of them, yes.

1008

I trust Shaun has another
genius scheme up his sleeve?

1009
00:59:46.875 --> 00:59:49.252
This is hardly
constructive, David!

1010
00:59:49.335 --> 00:59:50.336

is a waste of time.

get anywhere by moaning.

Get nice and limber. Or not.

Now, take another look at the way
he moves. Remember, very limp.

1020

Almost like sleepwalking.

1021
01:00:20.533 --> 01:00:24.662
Look at the face, it's
vacant with a hint of sadness.

-That's a good thing.

whereabouts more than we already have.

-Do we, David?

No, of course not, Lizzie.
I'm just being proactive.

-Somebody had to do something!

I don't know if you noticed back
there, but we were in a spot of bother.

1104
01:05:20.708 --> 01:05:22.293
Somebody has to take
control of the situation,

1105
01:05:22.376 --> 01:05:27.006
and if none of you are prepared
to accept that responsibility

1106
01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:30.093
then perhaps I should.

1107
01:05:30.718 --> 01:05:32.428
Will Shaun be gone long?

01:05:32.512 --> 01:05:34.806
-LIZ: He'll be back soon.
-How can you know that?

1109
01:05:34.889 --> 01:05:36.557
I don't think he'd
leave us, Daffs.

1110
01:05:36.641 --> 01:05:39.519
Wouldn't he? Lizzie, how
can you put your faith in a man

1111
01:05:39.602 --> 01:05:42.855
you spectacularly binned
for being unreliable?

1112
01:05:42.939 --> 01:05:44.816
A man whose idea
of a romantic nightspot

1113
01:05:44.899 --> 01:05:46.984
and an impenetrable
fortress are the same thing.

1114
01:05:47.068 --> 01:05:50.863
This is a pub! We are in a
pub! What are we going to do?

1115
01:05:51.489 --> 01:05:52.698
I could get a round in.

1116
01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:55.618
Look, let's just keep
quiet and wait for Shaun.

1117
01:05:55.701 --> 01:05:57.537
We can barricade the
window when he gets back.

1118
01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:00.414
What then? How long?
Days? Weeks? A month?

1119
01:06:00.498 --> 01:06:01.958
What about food? What
are we going to eat?

1120
01:06:02.041 --> 01:06:04.085
-Toasties!
-Yeah, there's a Breville out back.

1121
01:06:04.168 --> 01:06:06.003
Oh, great, then!
Saved by nibbles!

1122
01:06:06.087 --> 01:06:08.714
That must be why Shaun took
us here before he buggered off.

1123
01:06:08.798 --> 01:06:12.969
-He's coming back!
-Why? Because he promised?

1124
01:06:13.052 --> 01:06:15.638
And even if he does, do you think
his master plan's going to extend

1125
01:06:15.721 --> 01:06:18.432
to anything more than sitting
and eating peanuts in the dark?

1126
01:06:18.516 --> 01:06:21.185
What, is he just gonna stroll in and
suddenly everything's gonna be okay?

1127
01:06:21.269 --> 01:06:23.896
I don't know, David!

1128
01:06:24.397 --> 01:06:25.940
I don't know any
more than you do.

1129
01:06:26.023 --> 01:06:30.862
But what I do know is that we're here
now and we have to make the best of it!

1130
01:06:32.405 --> 01:06:35.324
-Ed, get me a double vodka.
-Right you are.

1131
01:06:35.408 --> 01:06:37.160
Think I'll have a
drink, too, actually.

1132
01:06:37.243 --> 01:06:39.162
-Would you like a drink, Barbara?
-Hello.

1133
01:06:39.245 --> 01:06:41.455
Right, great, fuck it. That's
what we'll do, that's what we'll do.

1134
01:06:41.539 --> 01:06:44.167
We'll all have a party. How about
that? We all get completely smashed.

-We got Twiglets.

-Pickle.
-Hello, Mum. You all right?

1139
01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:02.518
-Everybody okay?
-Yeah.

1140
01:07:02.602 --> 01:07:04.312
-Any sign of John and Bernie?
-We haven't seen them.

1141
01:07:04.395 --> 01:07:06.147
-Check upstairs?
-I think it's locked.

1142
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:09.650
-What's the phone situation?
-Dead. Same as the power.

1144
01:07:11.777 --> 01:07:13.696
Nice of you to join us.

1145
01:07:14.071 --> 01:07:16.866
Yeah, well, I
promised, didn't I?

1146
01:07:22.330 --> 01:07:24.790
How did you lose them?

1147
01:07:26.792 --> 01:07:30.338
I just gave them the slip. Wasn't
difficult. They're not all that.

1148
01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:32.173
Well, how did you get in?

1149
01:07:32.256 --> 01:07:33.883
There is a back door, David.

1150
01:07:33.966 --> 01:07:36.052
I tried to tell you before you
went and smashed the window.

1151
01:07:36.135 --> 01:07:39.555
Well, I wasn't the one who was blowing our
cover by having a tiff with my boyfriend.

1152
01:07:39.639 --> 01:07:41.057
He's not my boyfriend.

1153
01:07:41.724 --> 01:07:43.559
Might be a bit
warm, the cooler's off.

1154
01:07:43.643 --> 01:07:44.977
Thanks, babe.

1155
01:07:46.771 --> 01:07:48.773
So, what's the plan, then?

1156
01:07:51.484 --> 01:07:54.278
Would anyone like a peanut?

1157
01:08:03.663 --> 01:08:05.790

me at college to get close to Liz.

I was there to pick up the pieces.

that, Daffs, why can't you?

for you have always been essentially...

David, please! There are slightly
more pressing matters at hand here!

who fought off the reanimated
corpses of his entire family.

1490
01:31:44.666 --> 01:31:48.086
It's all coming right up
on Zombies From Hell.

1491
01:31:48.336 --> 01:31:51.047
MALE REPORTER: Six months
on and to many the events of Z-day

1492
01:31:51.130 --> 01:31:53.091
must seem like a bad dream.

1493
01:31:53.174 --> 01:31:57.136
And as we now know, the phenomenon
resulted from the use of highly...

1494
01:31:57.220 --> 01:32:00.932
...not something I ever expected as
a newscaster to have to say on air.

1495
01:32:02.100 --> 01:32:05.228
"Removing the head or
destroying the brain." Incredible.

1496
01:32:05.353 --> 01:32:08.856
Dead excited now, to have a top
band with us, talking about their work,

1497
01:32:08.940 --> 01:32:10.692
for the charity Zombaid.

1498
01:32:10.775 --> 01:32:14.570
FEMALE REPORTER: The fact that the mobile
deceased retained their primal instincts

1499
01:32:14.654 --> 01:32:17.740
make them ideal recruitment
for the service industry.

1500
01:32:17.824 --> 01:32:20.451
As well as proving themselves
useful in other roles, such as...

1501
01:32:21.285 --> 01:32:25.456
MAN: (LAUGHING) He can't
quite get it. He's fallen, he's down!

1502
01:32:27.583 --> 01:32:29.001
I don't see nothing
wrong with it

1503
01:32:29.085 --> 01:32:31.546
but I know that some people
would see something wrong with it.

1504
01:32:31.629 --> 01:32:33.756
But he's my husband, you know.

1505
01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:36.926
I still love him, and I still got
the ring on my finger, Trisha.

1506
01:32:37.009 --> 01:32:38.219
You go to bed with it?

1507
01:32:38.302 --> 01:32:39.554
WOMAN: 'Course I do.

1508
01:32:40.388 --> 01:32:44.142
TRISHA: All right. Okay, you
can't understand why she's with him.

1509
01:32:44.809 --> 01:32:48.187
Okay, what do you say to people
that criticize you for being with...

1510
01:32:48.271 --> 01:32:49.272
WOMAN: Well, they don't have...

1511
01:32:49.355 --> 01:32:52.775
MALE REPORTER: ...initial claims that the
virus was caused by rage infected monkeys

1512
01:32:52.859 --> 01:32:54.736
have now been dismissed as...

1513
01:32:54.819 --> 01:32:56.070
Hello.

1514
01:33:02.118 --> 01:33:03.911
What's the plan, then?

1515
01:33:04.245 --> 01:33:07.248
Right, a cup of tea,

1516
01:33:07.331 --> 01:33:09.917
then we get the Sundays.

1517
01:33:10.001 --> 01:33:12.503
Head down the
Phoenix for a roast,

1518
01:33:12.587 --> 01:33:14.839
veg out in the pub for a bit,

1519
01:33:15.339 --> 01:33:18.509
then wander home, watch
a bit of telly, go to bed.

1520
01:33:18.593 --> 01:33:21.137
-Perfect.
-I'll get the kettle on.

1521
01:33:21.220 --> 01:33:22.680
Can I have two sugars, please?

1522
01:33:22.764 --> 01:33:23.765
(EXCLAIMS)

1523
01:33:23.848 --> 01:33:25.475
Adventurous.

1524
01:33:25.558 --> 01:33:27.935
Actually, I might pop
into the garden for a bit.

1525
01:33:28.019 --> 01:33:29.979
Go on, then.

1526
01:33:30.062 --> 01:33:31.564
Two seconds.

1527
01:33:43.201 --> 01:33:45.536
MALE VOICE ON TV: Player
Two has entered the game.

1528
01:33:46.454 --> 01:33:47.622
Ed!

1529
01:33:50.041 --> 01:33:51.876
