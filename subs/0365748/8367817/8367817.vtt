00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:55.805
BARTENDER: Last orders, please.

2
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.981
-LIZ: Shaun.
-Yeah?

3
00:01:05.482 --> 00:01:08.735
-Do you see what I'm saying?
-Yeah, totally.

4
00:01:10.153 --> 00:01:12.697
I know he's your best friend,
but you do live with him.

5
00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:14.157
I know.

6
00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:18.411
It's not that I don't like Ed.
Ed, it's not that I don't like you.

7
00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:20.080
It's all right.

8
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.500
-It'd just be nice if we could...
-Fuck.

9
00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:27.212
-...spend a bit more time together.
-Bollocks.

10
00:01:27.295 --> 00:01:30.340
-Just the two of us.
-Cock it.

11
00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:33.218
It's just with Ed here, it's no wonder
I always bring my flatmates out,

12
00:01:33.301 --> 00:01:35.303
and then that only
exacerbates things.

13
00:01:35.387 --> 00:01:39.641
-What do you mean?
-Well, you guys hardly get on, do you?

14
00:01:39.724 --> 00:01:44.104
-No, what does "exacerbate" mean?
-It means to make things worse.

15
00:01:44.187 --> 00:01:45.689
Right, right.

16
00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.818
Well, I mean, it's not that I
don't like David and Di, you know.

17
00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:53.405
-Guys, it's not that I don't like you.
-BOTH: It's all right.

18
00:01:53.488 --> 00:01:55.949
And it's not that I don't want to
spend time with you, 'cause I do.

19
00:01:56.032 --> 00:01:59.035
It's just Ed doesn't
have too many friends.

20
00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.539
Can I get any of
you cunts a drink?

21
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.711
-Anybody?
-BOTH: No, thank you.

22
00:02:09.421 --> 00:02:13.800
I know friends are
important to Shaun,

23
00:02:13.883 --> 00:02:17.095
but you do actually have to set
some quality time aside for yourselves.

24
00:02:17.178 --> 00:02:21.016
Yeah, I mean Daffs is always
taking me to see these listed buildings,

25
00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.768
and, you know, I'm always
dragging him to the theater.

26
00:02:23.852 --> 00:02:25.020
I'm not so hot on theater.

27
00:02:25.103 --> 00:02:27.731
DIANNE: Well, how about a nice
meal? It's your anniversary soon, isn't it?

28
00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:31.443
-It was last week.
-Oh. Did you do anything special?

29
00:02:31.526 --> 00:02:33.903
-We came here.
-ED: Shaun. Hog lumps.

30
00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:38.825
Shaun, what I'm trying to
say is I need something more,

31
00:02:38.908 --> 00:02:41.036
more than spending every
night in the Winchester.

32
00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:43.538
I want to get out there and
do more interesting stuff.

33
00:02:43.621 --> 00:02:47.625
I want to live a little. I want
you to want to want to do it, too.

34
00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:51.671
Listen to me. I'm beginning
to sound like your mum.

35
00:02:51.755 --> 00:02:53.173
Not that I'd know
what she sounds like.

36
00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:56.092
-You still haven't met his mum?
-Not yet.

37
00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:57.719
Don't you get along
with your mum, Shaun?

38
00:02:57.802 --> 00:02:59.471
No. It's not that I
don't get on with her...

39
00:02:59.554 --> 00:03:02.515
-Are you ashamed by your mum, Shaun?
-No, I love my mum.

40
00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.267
-I love his mum.
-SHAUN: Ed!

41
00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:06.436
-She's like butter.
-Ed!

42
00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:07.520
-BOTH: Shaun!
-Guys.

43
00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:08.772
-Shaun.
-Liz.

44
00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:12.359
Look, I understand what you're
trying to say, okay, and I agree.

45
00:03:12.442 --> 00:03:15.195
We should get out there.
We'll start tomorrow.

46
00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:18.740
All right, I'll book a restaurant, you
know, the place that does all the fish.

47
00:03:18.823 --> 00:03:23.119
Just the two of us. Things
will change, I promise.

48
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.622
Really, Shaun?

49
00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:28.833
BARTENDER: Time, gentlemen.

50
00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:31.044
MAN ON JUKEBOX:
This town is coming like a ghost town

51
00:03:31.127 --> 00:03:32.462
LIZ: Shaun?

52
00:04:39.863 --> 00:04:42.198
MALE VOICE ON TV: Player
two has entered the game.

53
00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.576
Haven't you got work?

54
00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:47.036
MALE VOICE ON TV:
Player two has left the game.

55
00:05:00.049 --> 00:05:02.760
You do know the front door
was open again last night.

56
00:05:06.598 --> 00:05:08.641
-I'm not saying it was you.
-I know, man.

57
00:05:08.725 --> 00:05:10.894
-I'm saying it was Ed.
-Right.

58
00:05:11.936 --> 00:05:13.855
I can't live like this.

59
00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:16.649
I mean, just look
at the state of it.

60
00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:18.735
-We're not students anymore.
-Pete, just...

61
00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:20.987
I mean, it's not like he even brings
any real money into the house.

62
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.907
-Well, he brings a bit.
-What, dealing drugs?

63
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.659
Oh, he sells a bit of weed
every now and again, you know.

64
00:05:26.743 --> 00:05:27.911
You've sold puff.

65
00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:30.788
Yeah, once. At college. To you.

66
00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:33.708
Well, look, I've known him
since primary school, you know.

67
00:05:33.791 --> 00:05:35.418
I like having him
around, he's a laugh.

68
00:05:35.502 --> 00:05:38.838
What, because he can impersonate
an orangutan? Fuck-a-doodle-doo.

69
00:05:38.922 --> 00:05:40.256
Oh, leave him alone.

70
00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.968
All right, I admit he can
be pretty funny on occasion.

71
00:05:44.052 --> 00:05:46.095
Like that time we stayed up all
night drinking Apple Schnapps

72
00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:47.222
and playing Tekken 2.

73
00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:48.598
Oh, yeah.

74
00:05:50.266 --> 00:05:51.351
When was that?

75
00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:54.604
That was five years ago.
When's he going home?

76
00:05:56.898 --> 00:05:58.775
Hey, man, listen... Top left.

77
00:05:59.692 --> 00:06:02.320
-I was gonna say... Reload.
-I'm on it.

78
00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:05.073
-Since... Nice shot.
-Thanks.

79
00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:07.825
Two seconds.

80
00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:11.871
-You all right, Noodle?
-Hello, mate, got anything?

81
00:06:11.955 --> 00:06:14.332
-No, man.
-But Eball says you was holding.

82
00:06:14.415 --> 00:06:17.001
-I ain't got nothing.
-What? You ain't got nothing at all?

83
00:06:17.085 --> 00:06:20.296
ED: I've only got a Henry
meself. All right, laters.

84
00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:24.092
-Listen...
-PETE: Ed,

85
00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:26.970
since you're not
working at the moment,

86
00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:29.597
-could you please clean up a bit?
-ED: Yep.

87
00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:30.807
And if you play the
answer machine,

88
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.351
could you take down everyone's
messages, not just your own?

89
00:06:33.434 --> 00:06:34.644
Yep.

90
00:06:34.727 --> 00:06:36.563
It's not that taxing, is it?

91
00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:39.023
Writing something on
a little scrap of paper?

92
00:06:39.107 --> 00:06:41.109
-Nope.
-Right.

93
00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:48.491
-PETE: Dom, hi...
-Come on, it was pretty funny.

94
00:06:49.033 --> 00:06:51.661
-Will you do what he said though?
-I ain't doing nothing for him.

95
00:06:51.744 --> 00:06:53.705
Well, do it for me, then.

96
00:06:56.124 --> 00:06:57.750
I'm sorry, Shaun.

97
00:06:58.626 --> 00:07:02.338
-It's all right.
-No, no. I'm sorry, Shaun.

98
00:07:05.758 --> 00:07:06.759
Oh!

99
00:07:07.302 --> 00:07:09.262
Oh, my God, that's rotten.

100
00:07:09.345 --> 00:07:10.597
I'll stop doing them
when you stop laughing.

101
00:07:11.764 --> 00:07:12.890
I am not laughing, I'm going.

102
00:07:12.974 --> 00:07:14.767
-Get that.
-You get it.

103
00:07:17.854 --> 00:07:19.272
LIZ: Hello, Shaun, it's me.

104
00:07:19.355 --> 00:07:21.107
Look, I'm gonna be
a bit tied up today,

105
00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.860
So when you book the table, can
you make it 8:00 rather than 7:00?

106
00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:25.612
I'll try you at work.
Bye, bye, bye.

107
00:07:30.116 --> 00:07:32.285
Hey! You're dead.

108
00:07:40.501 --> 00:07:43.296
-Spare some change, please, mister?
-Yeah.

109
00:07:46.674 --> 00:07:48.718
MAN: Watch out. Are you blind?

110
00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:02.440
MAN ON RADIO: The American
deep space probe Omega Six,

111
00:08:02.523 --> 00:08:03.983
due to return to
earth this weekend,

112
00:08:04.067 --> 00:08:06.819
has unexpectedly re-entered Earth's
atmosphere over south-east England

113
00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:09.906
and broken apart over what's
believed to be a populated area.

114
00:08:25.463 --> 00:08:26.714
Nelson?

115
00:08:29.425 --> 00:08:30.426
Nelson?

116
00:08:33.763 --> 00:08:36.224
Hello, my friend. No beer today?

117
00:08:36.307 --> 00:08:38.434
No, it's a bit early for me.

118
00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:53.161
SHAUN: Gather round,
everyone. Gather round, please.

119
00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:54.242
Gather round.

120
00:08:54.325 --> 00:08:56.953
Now, as well as
Mr. Sloman being off today,

121
00:08:57.036 --> 00:09:00.915
I'm afraid Ash is feeling a
little bit under the weather.

122
00:09:00.998 --> 00:09:04.502
-So, I will be taking charge, as the...
-Oldest.

123
00:09:04.961 --> 00:09:06.879
Senior Staff Member.

124
00:09:06.963 --> 00:09:09.257
So, if we can all just pull
together, I know that...

125
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.802
Hello? Hello, mate.

126
00:09:12.885 --> 00:09:15.680
-Noel...
-I was totally munted last night.

127
00:09:16.764 --> 00:09:19.767
Yeah, I spoke to him.
He's only got Henry.

128
00:09:21.185 --> 00:09:23.604
-All right, mate. Laters.
-MAN: Laters.

129
00:09:31.654 --> 00:09:33.990
-Continue.
-Thank you.

130
00:09:35.158 --> 00:09:40.246
As Mr. Sloman always says, "There's
no 'I' in team but there is an 'I' in pie.

131
00:09:40.329 --> 00:09:42.457
"In... There's an
'I' in meat pie."

132
00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.876
The anagram of "meat" is "team." I
don't know what he's talking about.

133
00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:48.254
Look, that's it. And, Noel, phones
off, yeah? It's not a social gathering.

134
00:09:48.337 --> 00:09:50.214
All right, keep your
hair on, Grandad.

135
00:09:50.298 --> 00:09:54.844
Hey, hey, whoa. I'm 29 for Christ's
sakes. How old are you? 20? 21?

136
00:09:54.927 --> 00:09:57.722
-Seventeen.
-Hey, well...

137
00:09:58.973 --> 00:10:00.850
Look, I know you don't
wanna be here forever.

138
00:10:00.933 --> 00:10:03.102
I got things I wanna
do with my life.

139
00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:04.187
When?

140
00:10:06.397 --> 00:10:07.982
You got red on you.

141
00:10:10.193 --> 00:10:11.819
NOEL: Hello, mate.

142
00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:15.907
This one comes with a
basic, sort of, digital package.

143
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:19.869
You've got your lifestyle
channels there, a bit of Trisha.

144
00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:23.915
You've got entertainment...
I don't know what that is.

145
00:10:23.998 --> 00:10:29.754
News. All the basic
news channels.

146
00:10:30.129 --> 00:10:31.798
...coming after me like this...

147
00:10:31.881 --> 00:10:33.549
FEMALE REPORTER: ...believed
to be caused by exposure...

148
00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:36.010
-NOEL: Shaun.
-Yeah, I'm with customers.

149
00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:38.137
It's your dad.

150
00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:42.183
He's not my dad,
he's my stepdad.

151
00:10:45.394 --> 00:10:46.604
Philip.

152
00:10:49.273 --> 00:10:50.441
Shaun.

153
00:10:52.568 --> 00:10:55.446
I trust you haven't
forgotten about tomorrow.

154
00:10:55.738 --> 00:10:58.324
-No.
-Your bi-monthly visit.

155
00:10:58.407 --> 00:10:59.659
No, I haven't forgotten.

156
00:10:59.742 --> 00:11:03.329
Perhaps you could bring the flowers you
forgot to bring Barbara on Mother's Day.

157
00:11:03.412 --> 00:11:04.455
I was gonna.

158
00:11:04.539 --> 00:11:07.583
And not a cheap posy
from a garage forecourt.

159
00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:09.252
I wasn't gonna.

160
00:11:12.547 --> 00:11:15.174
Well, we look forward to
seeing you tomorrow, then.

161
00:11:15.258 --> 00:11:17.802
-Okay.
-You've got red on you.

162
00:11:26.686 --> 00:11:28.688
I thought you said this
wasn't a social gathering?

163
00:11:28.771 --> 00:11:29.897
What?

164
00:11:29.981 --> 00:11:32.191
How comes you're allowed
to speak to your dad?

165
00:11:32.275 --> 00:11:35.736
A, he's not my dad,
okay? He's my stepdad.

166
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.865
And B, it was an emergency.

167
00:11:38.948 --> 00:11:41.701
What, like buying your
mum some flowers?

168
00:11:41.784 --> 00:11:43.536
Noel, no matter what
you might think, okay,

169
00:11:43.619 --> 00:11:47.039
I do not find it difficult to keep my
work and my social life separate.

170
00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:49.417
MAN: Shaun. It's Liz for you.

171
00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:55.256
-Hello.
-LIZ: Hello, it's me.

172
00:11:55.339 --> 00:11:57.425
-Hello.
-Just quickly, did you get my message?

173
00:11:57.508 --> 00:11:58.551
Yep.

174
00:11:58.634 --> 00:12:00.803
-Oh, so it's all okay, then?
-Yep.

175
00:12:00.887 --> 00:12:02.388
800, the place that
does all the fish?

176
00:12:02.471 --> 00:12:03.681
Yeah.

177
00:12:03.764 --> 00:12:06.726
Oh, cool, well, that's
great. Just ring me later.

178
00:12:06.809 --> 00:12:09.687
-Goodbye, Liz.
-Bye. Bye, bye, bye.

179
00:12:11.105 --> 00:12:14.317
Liz from Head Office.
It's nothing to panic about.

180
00:12:18.696 --> 00:12:20.698
Sir? Sir?

181
00:12:21.073 --> 00:12:23.451
Sorry. They're for my mum.

182
00:12:24.327 --> 00:12:29.290
"To a wonderful mum"
or "Pow! Super Mum"?

183
00:12:29.373 --> 00:12:31.751
-The first one.
-Right.

184
00:13:15.962 --> 00:13:17.421
-Oh, my God!
-Jesus!

185
00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:19.382
-Shaun!
-Yvonne.

186
00:13:21.425 --> 00:13:23.636
-How are you doing?
-Surviving.

187
00:13:23.719 --> 00:13:25.137
So, are you living round here?

188
00:13:25.221 --> 00:13:28.307
-Um, yeah, are you?
-Yeah, I've just bought a place, actually.

189
00:13:28.391 --> 00:13:31.477
-Bought?
-I know, bit grown up, eh?

190
00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.729
-Are you still with...
-Liz.

191
00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:36.399
That's great. Glad
somebody made it.

192
00:13:36.482 --> 00:13:38.150
How long's that been now?

193
00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:41.112
It's three years ago
last week, actually.

194
00:13:41.195 --> 00:13:42.571
Did you do anything special?

195
00:13:42.655 --> 00:13:44.657
Well, we're going out for
a meal tonight, actually.

196
00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:46.409
Oh, anywhere nice?

197
00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.245
Yeah.

198
00:13:54.542 --> 00:13:55.835
Come on!

199
00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:01.716
-Are you gonna thank me, then?
-For what?

200
00:14:01.799 --> 00:14:03.175
Tidying up.

201
00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:06.595
-Well, it doesn't look that tidy.
-Well, I had a few beers when I finished.

202
00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:08.180
MAN ON PHONE: Hello,
Fulci's. Can you hold, please?

203
00:14:08.264 --> 00:14:09.390
Yeah.

204
00:14:09.473 --> 00:14:11.851
-Do you want your messages?
-What?

205
00:14:11.934 --> 00:14:14.478
Well, your mum rang about
going round tomorrow night.

206
00:14:14.562 --> 00:14:17.481
And then Liz rang about the
two of you eating out tonight.

207
00:14:17.565 --> 00:14:20.276
And then your mum rang back to
see if I wanted to eat her out tonight.

208
00:14:20.359 --> 00:14:21.694
-What?
-Hello, Fulci's.

209
00:14:21.777 --> 00:14:23.195
Yeah, hi.

210
00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:25.281
I know this is really short
notice and everything,

211
00:14:25.364 --> 00:14:28.868
but could you possibly do me a
table for two for tonight at about 8:00?

212
00:14:28.951 --> 00:14:31.537
No, sorry, we just
gave away the last table.

213
00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:32.621
God!

214
00:14:37.168 --> 00:14:38.377
Wasn't true about your mum.

215
00:14:38.461 --> 00:14:40.463
What am I gonna do?
Where are we gonna go?

216
00:14:40.546 --> 00:14:43.382
-The Winchester.
-Don't be stupid! They don't do food.

217
00:14:43.466 --> 00:14:45.051
There's a Breville out
back. John'll do you a toastie.

218
00:14:45.134 --> 00:14:46.385
Ed, this is serious!

219
00:14:47.803 --> 00:14:49.305
-Hello.
-LIZ: Hello, it's me.

220
00:14:49.388 --> 00:14:52.433
-Hello.
-So, what's the plan, then?

221
00:14:54.226 --> 00:14:57.104
Yeah, there's been a bit of
a mix-up with the table, babe.

222
00:14:57.188 --> 00:14:59.356
What do you mean?

223
00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.150
They're... They're full up.

224
00:15:01.233 --> 00:15:03.861
But I thought you
said it was all okay!

225
00:15:03.944 --> 00:15:05.154
Yeah.

226
00:15:05.946 --> 00:15:08.407
You didn't book
it, did you, Shaun?

227
00:15:08.491 --> 00:15:11.827
-No.
-So, what is the plan, then?

228
00:15:16.373 --> 00:15:17.750
The Winchester?

229
00:15:23.422 --> 00:15:24.590
DIANNE ON SPEAKER: Hello.

230
00:15:24.673 --> 00:15:25.841
Dianne, can you
let me in, please?

231
00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:27.968
I'm not sure this is
the best time, Shaun.

232
00:15:28.052 --> 00:15:29.095
Oh, come on.

233
00:15:29.178 --> 00:15:31.472
DAVID: Lizzie doesn't want
to see you, Shaun. Go away.

234
00:15:31.555 --> 00:15:35.643
-Just open the door!
-She doesn't want to see you, Shaun.

235
00:15:35.726 --> 00:15:37.103
What do you want me to
do? Do you want me to go...

236
00:15:37.186 --> 00:15:40.356
Do you want me to climb up the wall,
come through the window? 'Cause I will.

237
00:15:40.439 --> 00:15:41.565
DAVID: You're not coming in.

238
00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:45.069
-I... All right. See you in a minute.
-Don't...

239
00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:58.874
SHAUN: Hi, it's me again.

240
00:15:59.834 --> 00:16:02.128
Liz, can we just talk about
this? You know, let's go out.

241
00:16:02.211 --> 00:16:04.463
-What, to the Winchester?
-Well... Do you want to?

242
00:16:04.547 --> 00:16:07.341
-LIZ: No, I don't fucking want to!
-Okay. I just thought, you know...

243
00:16:07.424 --> 00:16:09.135
It's not the only place
in the world, Shaun!

244
00:16:09.218 --> 00:16:12.888
Well, we could go to The Shepherd's,
then, they do Thai in there now.

245
00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:14.348
I'm going out with David and Di.

246
00:16:14.431 --> 00:16:16.642
SHAUN: Well, let's all go together.
LIZ: What, you hang out with my friends?

247
00:16:16.725 --> 00:16:19.478
-Sorry, a failed actress and a twat?
-SHAUN: Well, that's harsh.

248
00:16:19.562 --> 00:16:22.940
LIZ: Your words. SHAUN: I did
not call Dianne a failed actress.

249
00:16:23.023 --> 00:16:24.358
Let's just go out, you know.

250
00:16:24.441 --> 00:16:25.985
Let's just go out
somewhere and have a laugh.

251
00:16:26.068 --> 00:16:27.653
Things'll be fine, I promise.

252
00:16:27.736 --> 00:16:29.196
You promised you'd
stop smoking when I did.

253
00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.157
-What...
-You promised you'd go back to the gym!

254
00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.825
-I...
-You promised you'd try drinking red wine

255
00:16:32.908 --> 00:16:33.908
-instead of beer!
-Well...

256
00:16:33.951 --> 00:16:35.202
You promised you'd
come on holiday with me.

257
00:16:35.286 --> 00:16:38.122
-We went to Greece, didn't we?
-We met in Greece.

258
00:16:38.205 --> 00:16:40.833
-At a rave.
-It's just not the same.

259
00:16:40.916 --> 00:16:43.752
-You promised things would change.
-You promised you'd get us free cable.

260
00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:45.504
-I'm working on that.
-Okay.

261
00:16:45.588 --> 00:16:47.506
Well, I can give up smoking. I
can give up whenever I want.

262
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:49.675
Look, see. Don't need them.

263
00:16:50.634 --> 00:16:54.263
-What was the next one?
-It's not enough, Shaun.

264
00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:04.857
Basically, I'd say your
nine lives are up, Shaun.

265
00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:06.734
Get fucked, four-eyes!

266
00:17:06.817 --> 00:17:09.445
Why don't you go out with
her, you love her so much?

267
00:17:09.528 --> 00:17:11.488
What do you mean by that?

268
00:17:12.573 --> 00:17:17.244
MALE REPORTER ON TV: The devastation really
is extensive. It really is a total mess.

269
00:17:17.328 --> 00:17:19.788
I don't know what
he meant by that.

270
00:17:23.334 --> 00:17:24.960
SHAUN: Got you these.

271
00:17:31.967 --> 00:17:33.719
To a wonderful mum?

272
00:17:33.802 --> 00:17:36.305
Oh! Yeah.

273
00:17:36.388 --> 00:17:40.392
Yeah, that's because I
thought it would be funny

274
00:17:40.476 --> 00:17:43.062
because of what you said
last night about me, you know,

275
00:17:43.145 --> 00:17:45.564
you don't wanna be my mum
and that, and it's just a little joke.

276
00:17:45.648 --> 00:17:48.984
It's something I just thought
of, spur of the moment.

277
00:17:50.319 --> 00:17:52.655
-They're for your mum, aren't they?
-Yeah.

278
00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:54.073
Smooth.

279
00:18:02.998 --> 00:18:04.083
Look, if I don't do something,

280
00:18:04.166 --> 00:18:06.752
I'm gonna end up in that pub,
every night, for the rest of my life,

281
00:18:06.835 --> 00:18:08.671
like those other sad old
fuckers, drinking myself to death,

282
00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:11.131
wondering what
the hell happened.

283
00:18:12.967 --> 00:18:14.927
What do you mean,
"Do something"?

284
00:18:48.502 --> 00:18:50.129
Fuck her!

285
00:18:50.212 --> 00:18:54.758
You got your pint. You got your
pig snacks. What more do you want?

286
00:18:56.427 --> 00:18:59.346
Oh. Your favorite monkey?

287
00:19:00.764 --> 00:19:02.391
Shall I do Clyde?

288
00:19:14.778 --> 00:19:17.072
See, I knew you'd get over her.

289
00:19:28.208 --> 00:19:31.754
-Who the hell put this on?
-It's on random.

290
00:19:32.504 --> 00:19:35.257
Ah, for fuck's sake.
John, yes, please, mate.

291
00:19:40.012 --> 00:19:42.264
You know what we
should do tomorrow?

292
00:19:42.348 --> 00:19:45.851
Keep drinking. We'll have
a Bloody Mary first thing.

293
00:19:45.934 --> 00:19:48.812
Have a bite at the King's Head,
couple at The Little Princess,

294
00:19:48.896 --> 00:19:52.483
we'll stagger back here and bang,
we're back at the bar for shots.

295
00:19:52.566 --> 00:19:54.318
How's that for a
slice of fried gold?

296
00:19:54.401 --> 00:19:56.820
-No.
-Come on, man.

297
00:19:59.323 --> 00:20:00.699
Talk to me.

298
00:20:00.783 --> 00:20:04.453
She said if she stayed with me, she'd
end up coming in here, every night,

299
00:20:04.536 --> 00:20:08.207
for the rest of her life, like these sad
old fuckers, drinking herself to death,

300
00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:10.125
wondering what
the hell happened.

301
00:20:10.209 --> 00:20:14.171
That is harsh. These are
rich, interesting characters.

302
00:20:14.254 --> 00:20:15.506
Like who?

303
00:20:18.467 --> 00:20:24.098
Snakehips. Always surrounded
by women. He's a bigamist.

304
00:20:24.181 --> 00:20:27.393
Strangled his first wife
with a draught excluder.

305
00:20:27.476 --> 00:20:29.853
And he invented
the mobile disco.

306
00:20:30.687 --> 00:20:32.689
Well, what about her, then?

307
00:20:33.982 --> 00:20:35.943
Cockacidal maniac.

308
00:20:37.569 --> 00:20:40.280
She's an ex-porn
star. She's done it all.

309
00:20:40.364 --> 00:20:44.034
They say she starred in the
world's first interracial hardcore loop.

310
00:20:44.118 --> 00:20:45.786
Café au Lait.

311
00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:48.372
Pour vous.

312
00:20:50.499 --> 00:20:53.460
Yeah. What about John, then?

313
00:20:53.544 --> 00:20:54.837
ED: He's North London Mafia.

314
00:20:56.088 --> 00:20:57.965
ED: It's true, Big Al says so.

315
00:20:58.048 --> 00:21:01.760
Yeah, well, Big Al also
says dogs can't look up.

316
00:21:01.844 --> 00:21:05.514
Think about it. Handy with
a blade. Gruff demeanor.

317
00:21:05.597 --> 00:21:08.434
Bernie, the trophy
wife. He's connected.

318
00:21:08.517 --> 00:21:10.102
Why do you think there's
a rifle above the bar?

319
00:21:10.185 --> 00:21:12.146
SHAUN: 'Cause the
pub's called the Winchester.

320
00:21:12.229 --> 00:21:13.522
Exactly.

321
00:21:14.356 --> 00:21:16.608
See, you don't need
Liz to have a good time.

322
00:21:16.692 --> 00:21:18.277
Oh, Ed, don't, man.

323
00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:22.865
No. Look at me. Can I
just say one more thing?

324
00:21:22.948 --> 00:21:26.034
I'm not gonna say, you know,
"There's plenty more fish in the sea."”

325
00:21:26.118 --> 00:21:28.370
I'm not gonna say, "If
you love her let her go."

326
00:21:28.454 --> 00:21:30.747
And I'm not gonna
bombard you with clichés.

327
00:21:30.831 --> 00:21:32.958
But what I will say is this,

328
00:21:34.668 --> 00:21:35.752
“It's not the end of the world."

329
00:21:42.009 --> 00:21:43.844
Sorry, we're closed.

330
00:21:47.306 --> 00:21:48.307
Pisshead.

331
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:52.394
Bass -Bass

332
00:21:53.896 --> 00:21:57.483
-White lines. Visions, dreams of passion
-White lines. Visions, dreams of passion

333
00:21:57.566 --> 00:21:59.943
-Blowing through my mind
-Blowing through my mind

334
00:22:00.027 --> 00:22:03.572
-And all the while I think of you. High...
-And all the while I think of you. High...

335
00:22:04.656 --> 00:22:07.409
ED: What's wrong,
haven't you had your tea?

336
00:22:08.577 --> 00:22:10.746
-Something of a phenomenon, baby
-Something of a phenomenon, baby

337
00:22:10.829 --> 00:22:12.664
-Telling my body to come along
-Telling my body to come along

338
00:22:12.748 --> 00:22:15.667
-'Cause white lines
-'Cause white lines

339
00:22:15.751 --> 00:22:17.586
-Blow away -Blow away

340
00:22:19.922 --> 00:22:21.006
Blow

341
00:22:22.257 --> 00:22:24.009
Get higher, baby

342
00:22:24.092 --> 00:22:26.011
Get higher, baby

343
00:22:26.094 --> 00:22:27.346
Get higher, girl

344
00:22:38.065 --> 00:22:39.691
-What's he doing?
-He should say "Bass."

345
00:22:39.775 --> 00:22:42.194
Or "Freeze."

346
00:22:42.277 --> 00:22:43.612
What a tit.

347
00:22:53.288 --> 00:22:54.873
You wanna dance?

348
00:23:02.798 --> 00:23:04.967
Hey, don't scratch it! Wait.

349
00:23:07.135 --> 00:23:08.762
That was the second
album I ever bought!

350
00:23:08.845 --> 00:23:11.223
It's 4:00 in the
fucking morning!

351
00:23:11.306 --> 00:23:14.184
-It's Saturday!
-No, it's not. It's fucking Sunday,

352
00:23:14.268 --> 00:23:16.478
and I've got to go to fucking
work in four fucking hours,

353
00:23:16.562 --> 00:23:20.065
because every other fucker in
my fucking department is fucking ill!

354
00:23:20.148 --> 00:23:23.402
Now can you see why
I'm so fucking angry?

355
00:23:23.485 --> 00:23:25.153
-Fuck, yeah!
-Hey.

356
00:23:25.237 --> 00:23:27.573
Pete, look, I'm...
You know, I'm sorry.

357
00:23:27.656 --> 00:23:31.827
We just... We've had a couple of
drinks. We split up with Liz tonight.

358
00:23:33.453 --> 00:23:35.455
Just keep it down, yeah?

359
00:23:36.582 --> 00:23:37.791
Prick.

360
00:23:39.042 --> 00:23:41.169
-PETE: What was that?
-Nothing.

361
00:23:42.045 --> 00:23:43.422
No, no, no, come on,
stop it. We're friends!

362
00:23:43.505 --> 00:23:45.632
He's not my friend.
He's a fucking idiot!

363
00:23:45.716 --> 00:23:46.800
What's that supposed to mean?

364
00:23:46.883 --> 00:23:49.094
It means, why
don't you fuck off?

365
00:23:49.177 --> 00:23:52.764
You wanna live like an animal, go
and live in the shed, you thick fuck!

366
00:23:52.848 --> 00:23:56.226
-Oh, leave him alone!
-Stop defending him, Shaun!

367
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:58.061
All he ever does
is hold you back!

368
00:23:58.145 --> 00:23:59.771
Or does it make your life
easier having someone around

369
00:23:59.855 --> 00:24:02.399
who's more of a loser than you?

370
00:24:02.482 --> 00:24:05.694
-What's that supposed to mean?
-You know what I mean.

371
00:24:05.777 --> 00:24:08.530
I assume it was Liz
who did the dumping?

372
00:24:09.531 --> 00:24:12.618
Sort your fucking
life out, mate!

373
00:24:12.701 --> 00:24:14.953
What's up with your hand, man?

374
00:24:16.038 --> 00:24:18.999
-I got mugged on the way home from work.
-By who?

375
00:24:19.082 --> 00:24:21.168
I don't know, some crackheads
or something. One of them bit me.

376
00:24:21.251 --> 00:24:22.461
Why did they bite you?

377
00:24:22.544 --> 00:24:25.422
I don't know. I didn't
stop to ask them!

378
00:24:25.505 --> 00:24:30.636
Now, I've got a splitting headache
and your stupid hip-hop isn't helping.

379
00:24:30.719 --> 00:24:33.096
And the front
door is open again!

380
00:24:34.598 --> 00:24:38.852
It's not Hip-Hop.
It's Electro. Prick.

381
00:24:38.935 --> 00:24:41.271
Next time I see him, he's dead.

382
00:24:52.741 --> 00:24:54.660
LIZ: Hello, Shaun, it's me.

383
00:24:54.743 --> 00:24:56.328
Look, I'm gonna be
a bit tied up today,

384
00:24:56.411 --> 00:24:59.122
So when you book the table, can
you make it 8:00 rather than 7:00?

385
00:24:59.206 --> 00:25:01.583
I'll try you at work.
Bye, bye, bye.

386
00:25:02.834 --> 00:25:06.129
BARBARA: Hello,
pickle. It's me, Mum.

387
00:25:06.213 --> 00:25:09.007
Dad said he saw you in town today and
mentioned you might be visiting tomorrow,

388
00:25:09.091 --> 00:25:10.550
which would be lovely.

389
00:25:10.634 --> 00:25:13.428
Will you be bringing
Elizabeth with you this time?

390
00:25:13.512 --> 00:25:15.347
Only, we can't wait
to meet her finally,

391
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:20.852
and also, I was wondering if she
wanted anything special for lunch.

392
00:25:20.936 --> 00:25:23.188
'Cause these days lots
of people don't eat meat.

393
00:25:39.246 --> 00:25:42.666
-Do you want anything from the shop?
-Cornetto.

394
00:26:51.693 --> 00:26:54.029
Nelson, have you got any papers?

395
00:26:55.739 --> 00:27:00.494
Nelson? I haven't even...
I owe you about fifteen p.

396
00:27:33.902 --> 00:27:35.362
Oh, dear.

397
00:27:38.031 --> 00:27:39.616
Sorry, I haven't got any change.

398
00:27:39.699 --> 00:27:42.536
I didn't even have enough
at the fucking shop, so...

399
00:27:42.619 --> 00:27:43.912
Oh, dear.

400
00:27:54.673 --> 00:27:56.633
Although no-one official
is prepared to comment,

401
00:27:56.716 --> 00:27:59.469
religious groups are calling
it Judgment Day. There's...

402
00:27:59.553 --> 00:28:02.264
...panic on
the streets of London...

403
00:28:02.347 --> 00:28:04.683
...as an increasing
number of reports of...

404
00:28:04.766 --> 00:28:06.184
SPORTS COMMENTATOR:
...Serious attacks on...

405
00:28:06.268 --> 00:28:07.727
...people, who
are literally being...

406
00:28:07.811 --> 00:28:08.979
NARRATOR:... eaten alive.

407
00:28:09.062 --> 00:28:11.231
Eyewitness reports are sketchy.

408
00:28:11.314 --> 00:28:16.361
One unifying detail seems to be that the
attackers in many instances, appear to be...

409
00:28:16.444 --> 00:28:19.948
...dead excited to have with us
here, a sensational chart-topping...

410
00:28:20.031 --> 00:28:24.160
...or ideological connection between
those committing the atrocities,

411
00:28:24.244 --> 00:28:25.829
and perhaps, more alarmingly...

412
00:28:25.912 --> 00:28:28.373
-ED: There's a girl in the garden.
-...their behavior.

413
00:28:29.124 --> 00:28:30.292
What?

414
00:28:31.793 --> 00:28:33.420
In the garden, there is a girl.

415
00:28:33.503 --> 00:28:38.049
MALE REPORTER: ...the armed forces will be
called in to provide back-up and assistance.

416
00:28:38.133 --> 00:28:43.387
Scientists are still trying to establish
the cause and nature of the phenomenon.

417
00:28:43.388 --> 00:28:44.388
Scientists are still trying to establish
the cause and nature of the phenomenon.

418
00:28:46.766 --> 00:28:48.101
Excuse me.

419
00:28:51.646 --> 00:28:53.189
Excuse me.

420
00:28:56.151 --> 00:28:57.444
Hello.

421
00:29:02.157 --> 00:29:03.199
What are you doing?

422
00:29:23.011 --> 00:29:24.512
Oh, my God.

423
00:29:27.015 --> 00:29:28.600
She's so drunk.

424
00:29:32.646 --> 00:29:36.191
How much have you had,
love? Oh, I think she likes you.

425
00:29:36.274 --> 00:29:38.944
-Shut up.
-I think she wants a cuddle.

426
00:29:39.027 --> 00:29:41.154
Listen, I'm serious. I've just
come out of a relationship.

427
00:29:43.073 --> 00:29:45.116
-Ed, do something.
-Wait there.

428
00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.743
-Ed!
-Two seconds.

429
00:29:46.826 --> 00:29:49.913
Jeez, look, I'm really flattered
and everything, really, but I just...

430
00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:54.125
ED: And hold it there.

431
00:29:54.209 --> 00:29:57.379
Ed, just get her off me! Jesus!

432
00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:01.800
Whoa. What's up with her
eyes? What's up with her eyes?

433
00:30:01.883 --> 00:30:05.345
Now seriously, Mary,
I'm warning you, okay.

434
00:30:05.428 --> 00:30:07.764
I'm gonna have to
get physical. I mean it!

435
00:30:07.847 --> 00:30:10.558
This is it. I'm gonna...
Look, just fuck off!

436
00:30:44.426 --> 00:30:47.262
-I think we should go back inside.
-Okay.

437
00:30:55.854 --> 00:30:59.024
-Shaun, what's going on?
-Shit, it's engaged.

438
00:30:59.107 --> 00:31:01.943
-How about an ambulance?
-It's engaged, Ed.

439
00:31:03.236 --> 00:31:04.446
Fire engine?

440
00:31:04.529 --> 00:31:08.700
It's one number, Ed, and it's busy. Okay?
What do you want a fire engine for, anyway?

441
00:31:08.783 --> 00:31:12.704
-Anything with flashing lights, you know.
-Are they still out there?

442
00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:23.006
Yeah. What do you
think we should do?

443
00:31:24.174 --> 00:31:25.717
Have a sit down?

444
00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:28.553
There are reports of
chaos on the motorways

445
00:31:28.636 --> 00:31:31.681
as thousands of people
attempt to flee the cities.

446
00:31:31.765 --> 00:31:35.393
The M1, the M3, M4, M6...

447
00:31:35.477 --> 00:31:36.895
Do you think this
is the same thing?

448
00:31:36.978 --> 00:31:40.565
...and M68 are
all at a standstill.

449
00:31:40.648 --> 00:31:44.944
The Home Office has issued a statement
urging people to stay in their homes

450
00:31:45.028 --> 00:31:46.613
and await further instruction.

451
00:31:46.696 --> 00:31:49.449
Ensure all residences are secure

452
00:31:49.532 --> 00:31:54.496
with all doors and windows firmly
locked and barricaded. Police...

453
00:31:56.664 --> 00:31:58.083
ED: Fucking hell!

454
00:31:58.166 --> 00:32:00.543
SHAUN: Oh, for God's
sake. Oh, he's got an arm off!

455
00:32:00.627 --> 00:32:02.087
Get him!

456
00:32:09.344 --> 00:32:10.470
Yeah.

457
00:32:15.141 --> 00:32:18.269
MALE REPORTER: More reports
just in confirm that in all cases

458
00:32:18.353 --> 00:32:21.314
<i>the attackers seem
slow and shambolic.</i>

459
00:32:22.107 --> 00:32:23.399
I'm gonna shut the front door.

460
00:32:23.483 --> 00:32:25.276
MALE REPORTER: ...receive
information from the Home Office,

461
00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:28.947
regarding the best way
to neutralize the attackers.

462
00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:34.119
In the meantime, contact with
these assailants is highly inadvisable.

463
00:32:34.202 --> 00:32:35.954
Did you see his head go?

464
00:32:36.037 --> 00:32:37.705
If you're confronted and
have the opportunity to escape,

465
00:32:38.998 --> 00:32:41.000
It is suggested that you
do so as quickly as possible.

466
00:32:41.084 --> 00:32:43.711
-We should get out there.
-No, no, no, no, we should stay inside.

467
00:32:43.795 --> 00:32:46.297
-Come on, we can take them.
-But the man said to stay indoors.

468
00:32:46.381 --> 00:32:47.507
Oh, fuck the man.

469
00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:50.218
Look, as long as they're out
there and we're in here, we're safe.

470
00:32:51.427 --> 00:32:52.846
MALE REPORTER: ...officials
suggest that in extreme circumstances,

471
00:32:52.929 --> 00:32:58.184
the attackers can be stopped by
removing the head or destroying the brain.

472
00:32:58.268 --> 00:33:04.065
I'll repeat that, by removing
the head or destroying the brain.

473
00:33:09.779 --> 00:33:11.156
Hey.

474
00:33:14.909 --> 00:33:16.536
Aim for the head.

475
00:33:35.221 --> 00:33:37.515
-Well, now what?
-We'll have to get more stuff.

476
00:33:37.599 --> 00:33:39.350
-What's in the shed?
-I don't know. It's locked.

477
00:33:39.434 --> 00:33:40.977
-Why is it locked?
-It's always been locked.

478
00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:43.396
Well, you know, we're gonna...

479
00:33:43.479 --> 00:33:44.480
Oh.

480
00:33:44.564 --> 00:33:47.609
No, no, that's the second
album I ever bought! Don't!

481
00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:57.243
Now, some of these are limited...
What was that? What was that?

482
00:33:57.327 --> 00:33:58.620
I think it was Blue Monday.

483
00:33:58.703 --> 00:34:01.581
-Man, that was an original pressing.
-Oh, for fuck's sake.

484
00:34:03.291 --> 00:34:04.375
-Purple Rain?
-No.

485
00:34:04.459 --> 00:34:05.627
-Sign O' The Times?
-Definitely not.

486
00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:07.879
-The Batman soundtrack?
-Throw it.

487
00:34:10.632 --> 00:34:13.134
-Okay. Oh, Dire Straits?
-Throw it.

488
00:34:17.639 --> 00:34:19.724
-The Stone Roses?
-No.

489
00:34:19.807 --> 00:34:21.476
-Second Coming?
-like it.

490
00:34:21.559 --> 00:34:22.727
Oh!

491
00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:24.395
-Sade?
-That's Liz's.

492
00:34:24.479 --> 00:34:26.606
-Yeah, but she did dump you.
-Oh.

493
00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:30.360
-Oh, fuck this. I'm going to the shed.
-I thought you said it was locked.

494
00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:45.208
-Which one do you want? Girl or bloke?
-The first one.

495
00:35:04.352 --> 00:35:06.521
MALE REPORTER: ...in all
cases, people receiving bites

496
00:35:06.604 --> 00:35:08.856
have experienced
headaches and nausea,

497
00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:11.025
and developed symptoms
similar to those displayed...

498
00:35:11.109 --> 00:35:12.777
-You've got red on you.
-...by their attackers.

499
00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:15.154
If you know someone
who has been bitten,

500
00:35:15.238 --> 00:35:19.200
it is absolutely essential that
you isolate them immediately.

501
00:35:20.243 --> 00:35:23.870
The public are being strongly
advised not to approach anyone...

502
00:35:23.871 --> 00:35:24.515
The public are being strongly
advised not to approach anyone...

503
00:35:24.539 --> 00:35:25.790
Pete?

504
00:35:28.418 --> 00:35:29.836
Pete?

505
00:35:29.919 --> 00:35:32.547
-Why don't we just go up?
-Oh, no, don't go up there.

506
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:35.341
-Why not?
-Because A, he might be one of them.

507
00:35:35.425 --> 00:35:37.802
And B, he might
still be annoyed.

508
00:35:38.886 --> 00:35:40.054
Pete?

509
00:35:41.139 --> 00:35:42.890
Maybe he went in to work.

510
00:35:42.974 --> 00:35:46.144
How come he didn't
drive? His keys are still here.

511
00:35:46.227 --> 00:35:49.063
Well, maybe he got a lift. He
said he wasn't feeling very well.

512
00:35:49.147 --> 00:35:51.983
-Pete?
-Prick!

513
00:35:53.901 --> 00:35:55.278
-He's not in.
-He's not in.

514
00:35:56.237 --> 00:35:58.698
-You got a fag?
-No, I've given up.

515
00:35:58.781 --> 00:36:00.742
-Since when?
-Since...

516
00:36:03.745 --> 00:36:07.123
Come on, babe.
Oh, she's engaged.

517
00:36:07.206 --> 00:36:08.750
-That was quick.
-Ed, this is serious!

518
00:36:09.917 --> 00:36:11.377
-Liz!
-BARBARA: Shaun.

519
00:36:11.461 --> 00:36:14.339
Mum! Hi. I was gonna
call you. Are you okay?

520
00:36:14.422 --> 00:36:16.507
-Yes.
-Yeah, well, are you sure?

521
00:36:16.591 --> 00:36:19.010
Some men tried to
get into the house.

522
00:36:19.093 --> 00:36:20.678
Well, are they still there?

523
00:36:20.762 --> 00:36:23.014
I'm not sure. We've
shut the curtains.

524
00:36:23.097 --> 00:36:24.515
Well, did you try the police?

525
00:36:24.599 --> 00:36:26.726
Well, I thought about it.

526
00:36:26.809 --> 00:36:28.269
Well, are you okay?
Did they hurt you?

527
00:36:28.353 --> 00:36:30.813
No, I'm fine, I'm fine.

528
00:36:30.897 --> 00:36:34.901
-Mum?
-Well, they were a bit bitey.

529
00:36:36.861 --> 00:36:40.740
-Mum, have you been bitten?
-No, but Philip has.

530
00:36:40.823 --> 00:36:41.866
Oh, okay.

531
00:36:41.949 --> 00:36:43.576
-Has she been bitten?
-No, Philip has.

532
00:36:43.659 --> 00:36:45.703
-Oh, okay.
-Listen, Mum, what sort of state is he in?

533
00:36:45.787 --> 00:36:49.123
Oh, he's fine. Bit
under the weather.

534
00:36:49.207 --> 00:36:50.875
-I see.
-What's the deal?

535
00:36:50.958 --> 00:36:52.251
We may have to kill my stepdad.

536
00:36:52.335 --> 00:36:55.171
Listen, Mum, sit tight, okay? You're
not safe there. We're coming over.

537
00:36:55.254 --> 00:36:58.341
-I don't want to cause a fuss.
-We're coming to get you, Barbara!

538
00:37:00.802 --> 00:37:02.637
So, what's the plan?

539
00:37:04.472 --> 00:37:05.515
Right.

540
00:37:07.141 --> 00:37:10.144
SHAUN: We take Pete's
car, we drive over to Mum's.

541
00:37:10.228 --> 00:37:11.646
We go in.

542
00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:15.483
-We take care of Philip.
-I'm so sorry, Philip.

543
00:37:15.566 --> 00:37:18.361
SHAUN: Then we grab Mum.
We go over to Liz's place.

544
00:37:18.444 --> 00:37:22.323
Hole up, have a cup of tea.
And wait for all this to blow over.

545
00:37:23.866 --> 00:37:26.285
-Why have we got to go to Liz's?
-Because we do.

546
00:37:26.369 --> 00:37:27.578
She dumped you!

547
00:37:27.662 --> 00:37:29.414
I have to know
if she's all right.

548
00:37:29.497 --> 00:37:31.707
-Why?
-Because I love her!

549
00:37:33.835 --> 00:37:36.796
All right, gay. I'm not
staying there though.

550
00:37:36.879 --> 00:37:37.922
Why not?

551
00:37:38.005 --> 00:37:40.383
If we hole up, I want to
be somewhere familiar.

552
00:37:40.466 --> 00:37:44.720
I want to know where the exits are,
and I wanna be allowed to smoke.

553
00:37:44.804 --> 00:37:45.847
Okay.

554
00:37:47.181 --> 00:37:50.601
Take Pete's car, go
round Mum's. Go in.

555
00:37:50.685 --> 00:37:52.854
-Deal with Philip.
-Sorry, Philip.

556
00:37:52.937 --> 00:37:56.774
SHAUN: Grab Mum, go to Liz's,
pick her up, bring her back here,

557
00:37:56.858 --> 00:37:59.735
have a cup of tea, and
wait for all this to blow over.

558
00:38:00.528 --> 00:38:01.988
Perfick.

559
00:38:02.071 --> 00:38:05.074
No, no, no, no, no, wait, we
can't bring them back here.

560
00:38:05.158 --> 00:38:07.201
-Why not?
-Well, it's not exactly safe, is it?

561
00:38:07.285 --> 00:38:09.704
Yeah. Look at the state of it.

562
00:38:10.997 --> 00:38:15.042
-Where's safe? Where's familiar?
-Where can I smoke?

563
00:38:20.381 --> 00:38:22.341
SHAUN: Take car, go to Mum's.

564
00:38:22.425 --> 00:38:23.843
-Kill Phil.
-Sorry.

565
00:38:23.926 --> 00:38:26.304
SHAUN: Grab Liz,
go to the Winchester,

566
00:38:26.387 --> 00:38:29.932
have a nice cold pint, and
wait for all this to blow over.

567
00:38:31.893 --> 00:38:34.020
How's that for a
slice of fried gold?

568
00:38:34.103 --> 00:38:35.938
Yeah, boy!

569
00:38:36.022 --> 00:38:39.150
To recap, it is vital that
you stay in your homes.

570
00:38:39.233 --> 00:38:41.819
Make no attempt
to reach loved ones

571
00:38:41.903 --> 00:38:45.323
and avoid all physical
contact with the assailants.

572
00:38:45.406 --> 00:38:47.909
Do you believe
everything you hear on TV?

573
00:38:50.244 --> 00:38:52.705
Yeah, I can see I, I can
see it. It's just outside.

574
00:38:52.788 --> 00:38:54.665
Any zombies out there?

575
00:38:55.625 --> 00:38:57.668
-Don't say that.
-What?

576
00:38:57.752 --> 00:38:59.587
-That.
-What?

577
00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:02.131
That. The Z word. Don't say it.

578
00:39:02.215 --> 00:39:04.800
-Why not?
-Because it's ridiculous.

579
00:39:04.884 --> 00:39:06.260
All right.

580
00:39:07.261 --> 00:39:09.055
Are there any out there, though?

581
00:39:10.264 --> 00:39:13.559
Can't see any. Maybe
it's not as bad as all that.

582
00:39:13.643 --> 00:39:15.520
Oh, no, there they are.

583
00:39:17.939 --> 00:39:19.106
Okay, let's do this, yeah?

584
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:20.274
-Yeah? Yeah?
-Yeah? Yeah?

585
00:39:20.358 --> 00:39:22.401
-Yeah?
-I got to do a wee first.

586
00:39:23.069 --> 00:39:24.987
Can I drive?

587
00:39:25.571 --> 00:39:27.698
-What?
-I've always wanted to drive Pete's car.

588
00:39:27.782 --> 00:39:30.785
-I might not get another chance.
-Okay.

589
00:40:04.986 --> 00:40:09.448
Oh, God. Sorry, Pete. Listen,
we're gonna borrow your car, okay?

590
00:40:11.033 --> 00:40:15.538
We'll bring it back. And if
you're feeling better later we're...

591
00:40:15.621 --> 00:40:19.125
We're going to the pub. So,
you're more than welcome to

592
00:40:21.252 --> 00:40:22.503
join us.

593
00:40:30.386 --> 00:40:33.097
Pete'd be so pissed off if he
knew I was driving his car, eh?

594
00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:34.682
I don't think so.

595
00:40:36.517 --> 00:40:39.061
Shaun, Shaun, which
button's central locking?

596
00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:46.986
Cock it!

597
00:40:48.195 --> 00:40:49.488
Get lost!

598
00:41:04.378 --> 00:41:05.546
Drive.

599
00:41:07.757 --> 00:41:08.799
<i>WOMAN ON RADIO:
The Church of England</i>

600
00:41:08.883 --> 00:41:11.802
has now joined other
extremist religious groups

601
00:41:11.886 --> 00:41:14.805
in proclaiming the phenomenon,
a sign of a coming apocalypse...

602
00:41:14.889 --> 00:41:16.140
Dad.

603
00:41:16.223 --> 00:41:19.518
...although Downing Street is refusing
to be drawn into a religious debate.

604
00:41:19.602 --> 00:41:23.564
Once again, the bodies of the
recently deceased are returning to life

605
00:41:23.648 --> 00:41:25.316
and attacking the living.

606
00:41:25.399 --> 00:41:27.151
-There is no indication as to...
-Let's put something else on.

607
00:41:27.234 --> 00:41:28.319
...how or indeed why...

608
00:41:29.487 --> 00:41:30.488
-What are you doing?
-What?

609
00:41:30.571 --> 00:41:32.114
Ed, look out!

610
00:41:36.243 --> 00:41:37.912
I think we hit something.

611
00:41:40.456 --> 00:41:41.832
Or someone.

612
00:41:51.842 --> 00:41:53.552
Are you all right?

613
00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:56.597
Come on, let's just go.

614
00:41:57.807 --> 00:41:58.849
Hello?

615
00:41:58.933 --> 00:42:02.103
-He's gonna be dead either way.
-Ed, that's not the point.

616
00:42:08.234 --> 00:42:09.402
Oh, thank God for that.

617
00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:19.245
ED: Ah, hello. Who's
a pretty boy, then?

618
00:42:23.290 --> 00:42:24.750
You didn't tell me
Barbara had a Jag.

619
00:42:24.834 --> 00:42:26.544
Oh, I've always wanted
to drive one of those.

620
00:42:26.627 --> 00:42:28.671
SHAUN: Yeah, well, it's Philip's,
okay? And he won't let anybody near it.

621
00:42:28.754 --> 00:42:30.423
Honestly, I put half a Mars
Bar in the glove box once,

622
00:42:30.506 --> 00:42:32.091
and he chased me round
the garden with a bit of wood.

623
00:42:32.174 --> 00:42:34.260
Fuck, it's gorgeous.

624
00:42:34.343 --> 00:42:36.846
Okay, well, it seems
pretty clear, we should go.

625
00:42:36.929 --> 00:42:41.559
-Why don't I stay here?
-What, what, what, what, what?

626
00:42:41.642 --> 00:42:44.353
You know, just look after the
car. If there's any problems,

627
00:42:45.563 --> 00:42:46.564
I'll honk three times.

628
00:42:47.982 --> 00:42:49.150
Okay.

629
00:42:53.654 --> 00:42:55.823
-Don't forget to kill Philip!
-What?

630
00:42:57.241 --> 00:42:59.326
-Hello, pickle.
-Hi, Mum.

631
00:43:00.161 --> 00:43:02.496
-Oh, you've got red on you.
-Yeah.

632
00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:04.915
Look, Mum, is everything
okay? Are you all right?

633
00:43:04.999 --> 00:43:07.543
-Yes, I'm fine.
-Where's Philip?

634
00:43:07.626 --> 00:43:09.503
-Dad's in the lounge.
-He's not my dad.

635
00:43:09.587 --> 00:43:10.921
Oh, Shaun, really.

636
00:43:11.005 --> 00:43:13.924
Sorry. Mum, look, I've got Ed outside.
We're gonna take you somewhere safe.

637
00:43:14.008 --> 00:43:15.342
But we have to
wait for the doctor.

638
00:43:15.426 --> 00:43:16.677
Mum, I don't think the
doctor's gonna come.

639
00:43:16.761 --> 00:43:18.679
I don't think Philip's going to
want to leave the house, darling.

640
00:43:18.763 --> 00:43:20.556
Mum, Philip isn't...

641
00:43:21.182 --> 00:43:23.934
Put the kettle on,
and I'll deal with Philip.

642
00:43:24.018 --> 00:43:25.770
-Okay.
-Okay, then.

643
00:43:25.853 --> 00:43:27.605
-Are you hungry?
-Yeah. No, not really!

644
00:43:27.688 --> 00:43:30.107
-I'll make some sandwiches.
-Okay.

645
00:43:31.275 --> 00:43:33.068
No fighting, you two.

646
00:43:34.361 --> 00:43:38.032
MAN ON TV: ...you may
ask "Where is our God?"

647
00:43:38.783 --> 00:43:40.201
But throughout the land,

648
00:43:40.284 --> 00:43:45.539
men and women of integrity rise
up to confront the unseen enemy.

649
00:43:47.082 --> 00:43:52.213
They will not be cowards, they will
be courageous in the face of danger.

650
00:43:59.053 --> 00:44:00.888
-I'm so sorry, Philip.
-Why?

651
00:44:02.056 --> 00:44:03.390
What have you done now?

652
00:44:03.474 --> 00:44:06.811
-Nothing.
-What have you got there? Flowers, I hope.

653
00:44:06.894 --> 00:44:10.773
-No, it's... Cricket bat.
-Oh, is that for the jumble, Shaun?

654
00:44:10.856 --> 00:44:12.024
No. Yes.

655
00:44:12.107 --> 00:44:15.986
There's a box of your toys upstairs. I
was going to give them to the jumble.

656
00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:18.030
I took them all to
the tip, Barbara.

657
00:44:18.113 --> 00:44:20.574
-Oh, what?
-Shaun wants to take us somewhere.

658
00:44:20.658 --> 00:44:22.493
Don't be silly. I'm
not going anywhere.

659
00:44:22.576 --> 00:44:23.786
Well, maybe you
should stay here.

660
00:44:23.869 --> 00:44:25.287
You know, wait for the
doctor, and I'll take Mum.

661
00:44:25.371 --> 00:44:28.624
-But you said the doctor wasn't coming.
-You didn't call the doctor, did you?

662
00:44:28.707 --> 00:44:30.334
Well, I thought we ought
to be on the safe side.

663
00:44:30.417 --> 00:44:31.961
I'm quite all right, Barbara.

664
00:44:32.044 --> 00:44:34.505
-I ran it under a cold tap.
-I really think...

665
00:44:34.588 --> 00:44:36.966
We had our jabs when
we went to the Isle of Wight.

666
00:44:37.049 --> 00:44:38.884
-But, Philip...
-It's a lot of overblown nonsense.

667
00:44:40.052 --> 00:44:41.512
A lot of drug nuts running wild.

668
00:44:41.595 --> 00:44:44.098
Still, I should get Mum away, you
know, just "cause, in case they come back.

669
00:44:44.181 --> 00:44:45.766
I'm not going
anywhere without Philip.

670
00:44:45.850 --> 00:44:49.061
Mum, look, how about that tea?

671
00:44:50.396 --> 00:44:54.567
Mum? How much
do you love Philip?

672
00:44:54.650 --> 00:44:55.734
Two sugars, is it?

673
00:44:55.818 --> 00:44:57.903
I haven't had sugar
in my tea since 1982.

674
00:44:57.987 --> 00:44:59.363
Oh, yes.

675
00:44:59.446 --> 00:45:01.532
Will you cut me
some bread, love?

676
00:45:01.615 --> 00:45:03.909
Mum, look, how much
do you love Philip?

677
00:45:03.993 --> 00:45:06.161
Oh, Shaun, do we have
to go through all that again?

678
00:45:06.245 --> 00:45:08.873
Mum, look, what would you
say if I told you that over the years

679
00:45:08.956 --> 00:45:10.374
Philip's been
quite unkind to me?

680
00:45:10.457 --> 00:45:12.376
Well, you weren't always
the easiest person to live with.

681
00:45:12.459 --> 00:45:14.253
Mum, he chased me around
the garden with a bit of wood!

682
00:45:14.336 --> 00:45:16.213
Well, you did call
him a you-know-what.

683
00:45:16.297 --> 00:45:17.882
-Oh, what, did he tell you that?
-Yes, he did.

684
00:45:17.965 --> 00:45:19.216
-Motherfucker.
-Shaun.

685
00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:21.218
Sorry, Mother, Mum.

686
00:45:21.302 --> 00:45:26.557
Look, Mum, did you know that on
several occasions he touched me?

687
00:45:31.979 --> 00:45:35.065
That wasn't true. Made it
up, shouldn't have done, sorry.

688
00:45:35.149 --> 00:45:37.526
-Mum, you don't understand, okay...
-No, it's you that doesn't understand.

689
00:45:37.610 --> 00:45:40.112
Philip is my husband and
has been for the last 17 years.

690
00:45:40.195 --> 00:45:42.573
I know you haven't
always seen eye-to-eye,

691
00:45:42.656 --> 00:45:46.243
but I would, at least, expect
you to respect my feelings.

692
00:45:46.327 --> 00:45:47.870
You must be more
adult about these things.

693
00:45:47.953 --> 00:45:52.082
Yeah, come on, Shaun.

694
00:45:52.166 --> 00:45:59.048
There comes a time when
you just got to be a man.

695
00:46:07.514 --> 00:46:10.601
I'm telling you, it's
a fuss over nothing.

696
00:46:10.684 --> 00:46:12.686
-Hello, Edward.
-Hi, Barbara.

697
00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:15.439
-BARBARA: My, how you've grown.
-Yeah, you better believe it.

698
00:46:15.522 --> 00:46:17.566
What happened? Why is he coming?

699
00:46:17.650 --> 00:46:19.026
It wasn't as easy as all that.

700
00:46:19.109 --> 00:46:20.903
-ED: God's sake.
-So, we're following you, are we?

701
00:46:20.986 --> 00:46:24.365
No, it's probably best if
we... Where's the car?

702
00:46:26.909 --> 00:46:30.162
-I pranged it.
-You were parked!

703
00:46:30.245 --> 00:46:31.455
Yeah.

704
00:46:32.373 --> 00:46:34.541
I guess we'll have
to take the Jag.

705
00:46:36.543 --> 00:46:38.337
-Philip...
-What?

706
00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:39.880
Look out!

707
00:46:42.091 --> 00:46:43.425
PHILIP: Christ!

708
00:46:44.969 --> 00:46:46.136
ED: Jesus!

709
00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:53.894
-Philip, give me the car keys!
-You're not driving that car.

710
00:46:53.978 --> 00:46:57.022
Philip! Give me the car keys!

711
00:46:57.106 --> 00:46:59.692
-Ed, get Mum in the car.
-I'm on it.

712
00:47:00.859 --> 00:47:02.653
-SHAUN: Come on.
-No, don't worry about me.

713
00:47:02.736 --> 00:47:04.405
Worry about your mother.

714
00:47:04.863 --> 00:47:08.117
-Ed, maybe I should drive.
-Man, I've adjusted the seat now.

715
00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:10.619
All right, well, just,
you know, be careful!

716
00:47:21.088 --> 00:47:24.216
Can you please
turn that noise down?

717
00:47:24.925 --> 00:47:28.554
Are you all right, dear?
Would you like another tissue?

718
00:47:28.637 --> 00:47:31.724
I'd be fine, if it weren't
for that bloody racket!

719
00:47:31.807 --> 00:47:34.518
-It is a bit loud.
-Sorry, Barbara.

720
00:47:36.603 --> 00:47:39.398
You do realize this is
a 20 mile an hour zone.

721
00:47:39.481 --> 00:47:40.774
Oh, yeah.

722
00:47:44.111 --> 00:47:45.112
Here.

723
00:47:45.195 --> 00:47:48.574
Okay, Mum, listen, this isn't
gonna take a second, all right?

724
00:47:50.284 --> 00:47:51.785
Philip, have you still
got the child locks on?

725
00:47:51.869 --> 00:47:53.620
Safety first, Shaun.

726
00:47:54.747 --> 00:47:56.248
You can't...

727
00:47:58.292 --> 00:48:01.295
Hey, man, watch the leather.

728
00:48:03.088 --> 00:48:05.466
Listen, okay, keep moving.
If there's any problems...

729
00:48:05.549 --> 00:48:07.426
Yeah, yeah, I'll do the honks.

730
00:48:32.701 --> 00:48:33.952
DIANNE ON SPEAKER: Hello?

731
00:48:36.455 --> 00:48:37.956
Hello?

732
00:49:00.521 --> 00:49:02.189
Guys, can you let me in, please?

733
00:49:02.272 --> 00:49:05.109
-What are you doing?
-I've come to get you.

734
00:49:18.122 --> 00:49:19.498
Sorry, what are you doing?

735
00:49:19.581 --> 00:49:20.791
I've come to take
you somewhere safe.

736
00:49:20.874 --> 00:49:24.044
-We were perfectly safe before you arrived.
-You don't know that.

737
00:49:24.128 --> 00:49:26.380
Well, there was two of them out there a
minute ago. How many are there now?

738
00:49:27.548 --> 00:49:28.924
-Lots.
-Lots!

739
00:49:29.007 --> 00:49:31.802
Look, believe me, it only takes
one of them to know you're in here.

740
00:49:31.885 --> 00:49:34.012
Listen, I tried calling, I really
did, but I couldn't get through.

741
00:49:34.096 --> 00:49:36.515
-I had to come up with a plan.
-Oh, you made a plan.

742
00:49:36.598 --> 00:49:39.393
Look, I don't care what the telly says,
all right, we have to get out of here.

743
00:49:39.476 --> 00:49:41.812
If we don't, they'll come up
here and they'll tear us to pieces.

744
00:49:41.895 --> 00:49:44.481
And that is really gonna
exacerbate things for all of us.

745
00:49:44.565 --> 00:49:46.316
-Shaun...
-Look, Liz,

746
00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:48.318
this is not about
you and me, all right?

747
00:49:48.402 --> 00:49:49.736
This is about survival.

748
00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:51.738
We need to be somewhere more
secure, somewhere on the ground,

749
00:49:51.822 --> 00:49:53.699
somewhere we can stay alive.

750
00:49:53.782 --> 00:49:55.909
-DIANNE: We're with you, Shaun.
-What?

751
00:49:55.993 --> 00:49:57.369
We're with you.

752
00:49:57.452 --> 00:49:58.912
I'm not going out there.

753
00:49:58.996 --> 00:50:01.081
Daffs! I don't want
to be torn to pieces,

754
00:50:01.165 --> 00:50:03.500
and I'm sure if you really
think about it, neither do you.

755
00:50:03.584 --> 00:50:06.003
-I'm not going if Liz is not going.
-Of course she's going.

756
00:50:06.086 --> 00:50:08.922
-Well, I'm not staying here by myself.
-You're going, aren't you, Elizabeth?

757
00:50:09.006 --> 00:50:11.008
-Lizzie?
-Liz?

758
00:50:15.888 --> 00:50:17.764
All right, Flash, what
do you have in mind?

759
00:50:17.848 --> 00:50:21.643
Great, okay, I've got a car outside,
but it's gonna be a bit cramped now.

760
00:50:21.727 --> 00:50:23.854
-So, has anyone got transport?
-Yes, yes.

761
00:50:23.937 --> 00:50:26.607
-Great. Where?
-Oh, no. Well, I've passed my test.

762
00:50:28.108 --> 00:50:29.109
David?

763
00:50:29.193 --> 00:50:31.945
I don't see the point of
owning a car in London.

764
00:50:32.613 --> 00:50:35.282
Look, okay, just get any
blunt objects together, all right?

765
00:50:35.365 --> 00:50:38.035
If you get cornered, bash them
in the head, that seems to work.

766
00:50:38.118 --> 00:50:40.954
Keep together, stay
sharp and follow me.

767
00:50:41.038 --> 00:50:45.083
-So, what... What's the plan, then?
-We're going to the Winchester.

768
00:50:50.005 --> 00:50:51.757
Okay? Let's go.

769
00:51:07.773 --> 00:51:10.108
-Come on.
-Where's the car?

770
00:51:14.613 --> 00:51:16.281
What's up, niggaz?

771
00:51:21.662 --> 00:51:24.790
Okay, apologies for the cramped conditions,
everybody, okay? Di, stay on David's lap?

772
00:51:24.873 --> 00:51:26.500
-Okay.
-Philip, hang in there, okay?

773
00:51:26.583 --> 00:51:28.460
-Ed, get there fast, yeah?
-Yeah.

774
00:51:28.543 --> 00:51:30.963
And, Mum, this is Liz. Liz, Mum.

775
00:51:31.046 --> 00:51:32.339
-Hello.
-Hello.

776
00:51:39.054 --> 00:51:40.097
-Ed.
-Shaun.

777
00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:41.848
I know. Ed, be careful.

778
00:51:41.932 --> 00:51:43.392
-Is your dad all right?
-He's not my dad.

779
00:51:43.475 --> 00:51:45.894
-DIANNE: He's bleeding.
-Yeah, I know. Ed, just be careful!

780
00:51:45.978 --> 00:51:48.313
Thought you wanted
to get there fast?

781
00:51:49.898 --> 00:51:52.776
I just want to get there in one piece,
okay? And why are we going this way?

782
00:51:52.859 --> 00:51:54.361
Chill out, it's a shortcut.

783
00:51:54.444 --> 00:51:55.862
But that road goes
straight to the Winchester.

784
00:51:55.946 --> 00:51:59.157
-Shaun.
-Look, I know. Liz, please!

785
00:51:59.241 --> 00:52:02.286
I still don't actually understand
why we are going to the Winchester.

786
00:52:02.369 --> 00:52:04.621
Because it's a pub,
it's safe, it's secure.

787
00:52:04.705 --> 00:52:06.623
-They know us there.
-What makes it so secure?

788
00:52:06.707 --> 00:52:09.584
Because it's got big heavy doors
and deadbolts. You've been to a lock in.

789
00:52:09.668 --> 00:52:11.128
-Several.
-And there's a rifle above the bar.

790
00:52:11.211 --> 00:52:13.547
-I would think that's deactivated.
-Surely.

791
00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:16.425
It's not. I'm telling you. John's
connected. Big Al says so.

792
00:52:16.508 --> 00:52:18.427
Yeah, well, Big Al also
says dogs can't look up!

793
00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:19.636
-They can't.
-Can't they?

794
00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:21.138
-No, they can't!
-Of course they can!

795
00:52:21.221 --> 00:52:23.974
-Are you sure? I...
-Yes, look, the pub is the right place to go.

796
00:52:24.057 --> 00:52:25.934
Okay? Everything is
gonna be fine, I promise.

797
00:52:26.018 --> 00:52:27.894
-Shaun?
-I turned it off, all right?

798
00:52:27.978 --> 00:52:30.647
-It's not easy.
-What?

799
00:52:30.731 --> 00:52:34.443
-Being a father, it's not easy.
-What?

800
00:52:34.526 --> 00:52:39.364
You were 12 when I met you.
You'd already grown up so much.

801
00:52:39.448 --> 00:52:45.078
I just wanted you to be strong and
not give up because you lost your dad.

802
00:52:45.746 --> 00:52:47.331
Philip, you don't
have to explain.

803
00:52:47.414 --> 00:52:51.668
No, I do. I always
loved you, Shaun.

804
00:52:51.752 --> 00:52:57.507
I always thought you
had it in you to do well.

805
00:52:57.591 --> 00:53:00.594
And you just need motivation.

806
00:53:00.677 --> 00:53:04.264
Somebody to look up to, and...

807
00:53:06.099 --> 00:53:08.143
I thought it could be me.

808
00:53:10.103 --> 00:53:13.732
Would you just take
care of your mum?

809
00:53:16.485 --> 00:53:18.362
There's a good boy.

810
00:53:21.948 --> 00:53:24.618
-Ed, can you pull over?
-Two seconds.

811
00:53:27.537 --> 00:53:29.498
-Ed, please pull over.
-What for?

812
00:53:29.581 --> 00:53:31.792
-Ed, just pull over!
-All right.

813
00:53:38.465 --> 00:53:39.549
Whoa, mama!

814
00:53:39.633 --> 00:53:41.051
Christ! What the hell do
you think you're doing?

815
00:53:41.134 --> 00:53:45.639
-Chill out. Everyone's all right.
-Stop telling me to chill out!

816
00:53:46.765 --> 00:53:48.934
And no, for your information,
everybody is not all right.

817
00:53:49.017 --> 00:53:50.727
BARBARA: What's wrong?

818
00:53:50.811 --> 00:53:54.314
-Mum, it's Philip, he's gone.
-Where's he gone?

819
00:53:54.398 --> 00:53:57.567
-Mum, he's dead.
-No, he isn't.

820
00:53:59.069 --> 00:54:01.571
Get out! Get out!

821
00:54:01.905 --> 00:54:04.908
Oh, Jesus! Fuck, fuck.

822
00:54:04.991 --> 00:54:06.493
It won't open! It won't open!

823
00:54:06.576 --> 00:54:09.913
-Ed, get the child locks!
-DIANNE: Come on, quick, come on.

824
00:54:09.996 --> 00:54:11.081
It won't open.

825
00:54:13.333 --> 00:54:14.835
Ed!

826
00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:35.939
-Now what?
-We've got to keep moving.

827
00:54:36.022 --> 00:54:37.774
-How do we get Philip out the car?
-SHAUN: We haven't got time.

828
00:54:37.858 --> 00:54:39.609
-LIZ: What about the blunt objects?
-Do you want to get them?

829
00:54:39.693 --> 00:54:41.903
-Shaun, we can't just leave your dad!
-He's not my dad!

830
00:54:41.987 --> 00:54:44.531
-Oh, Shaun...
-Mum, he was, but he's not anymore!

831
00:54:44.614 --> 00:54:46.616
-I really think we could...
-No, listen to me, Mum, listen.

832
00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:48.577
That's not even your
husband in there.

833
00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:49.870
Okay? I know it looks like him,

834
00:54:49.953 --> 00:54:53.290
but there is nothing of the man
you loved in that car now, nothing!

835
00:54:56.042 --> 00:54:57.544
Let's go, shall we?

836
00:54:58.336 --> 00:55:00.671
You're not seriously
suggesting we walk!

837
00:55:00.672 --> 00:55:01.672
You're not seriously
suggesting we walk!

838
00:55:02.841 --> 00:55:06.887
-Everybody okay back there?
-ED: Oh, yeah, we're having a whale of a time.

839
00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:09.931
Maybe we should all hold
hands, like a crocodile?

840
00:55:10.015 --> 00:55:12.142
Do you have any idea
where we're actually going?

841
00:55:12.225 --> 00:55:14.811
-LIZ: David, come on.
-Sorry.

842
00:55:14.895 --> 00:55:16.980
-Do you, though?
-Yeah, totally, totally.

843
00:55:17.063 --> 00:55:18.732
Well, are we close?

844
00:55:24.905 --> 00:55:26.573
SHAUN: We're pretty close.

845
00:55:27.616 --> 00:55:29.993
LIZ: Is your mum gonna be
okay? SHAUN: Yeah, I hope so.

846
00:55:30.076 --> 00:55:31.453
Did you manage to get
in contact with your folks?

847
00:55:31.536 --> 00:55:33.663
-They're in Antigua.
-Do you think this is happening there?

848
00:55:33.747 --> 00:55:35.540
I hope not.

849
00:55:35.624 --> 00:55:38.835
Listen, Liz, about last night. You know,
I know loads of things were said, but...

850
00:55:38.919 --> 00:55:40.670
Shaun, you said this
wasn't about you and me.

851
00:55:40.754 --> 00:55:43.340
-No, no, it's not, but, I just...
-You said it was about survival.

852
00:55:43.423 --> 00:55:44.508
Yeah, it is, but
what I'm saying is...

853
00:55:44.591 --> 00:55:46.259
You're not doing all this just
to prove something, are you?

854
00:55:46.343 --> 00:55:47.344
No, of course
not. I just think...

855
00:55:47.427 --> 00:55:49.930
Because I meant everything I
said last night. Nothing's changed.

856
00:55:52.682 --> 00:55:54.309
Maybe this isn't the
best time to talk about it.

857
00:55:54.392 --> 00:55:56.228
-Okay...
-Oh, my God!

858
00:55:57.270 --> 00:55:58.522
Shaun.

859
00:55:59.397 --> 00:56:01.608
-Yvonne.
-How's it going?

860
00:56:02.651 --> 00:56:04.402
-Surviving.
-Hey, Liz.

861
00:56:04.486 --> 00:56:07.113
-Long time no see.
-Hey, Yvonne.

862
00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:10.867
This is my boyfriend, Declan.

863
00:56:10.951 --> 00:56:16.206
My friends Mark, Maggie,
my mum and my cousin Tom.

864
00:56:16.289 --> 00:56:18.583
This is Shaun and
his girlfriend Liz.

865
00:56:18.667 --> 00:56:21.378
-They've split up, actually.
-YVONNE: Oh, really?

866
00:56:21.461 --> 00:56:23.880
-Yeah.
-That's a shame.

867
00:56:23.964 --> 00:56:25.715
Well, we should scoot.

868
00:56:25.799 --> 00:56:29.094
-Have you got somewhere you're going?
-Yeah, we're going to the Winchester.

869
00:56:29.177 --> 00:56:30.470
The pub?

870
00:56:32.597 --> 00:56:35.392
-Yeah.
-Right, well. Good luck!

871
00:56:41.439 --> 00:56:42.899
-Hi!
-Hi!

872
00:56:42.983 --> 00:56:44.234
-Hello.
-Hello.

873
00:56:44.317 --> 00:56:45.569
-Hi.
-Hi.

874
00:56:45.652 --> 00:56:47.362
-Hello.
-Hello.

875
00:56:47.445 --> 00:56:48.738
-All right.
-All right.

876
00:56:50.865 --> 00:56:53.076
See, what did I say? The
Winchester's just over there.

877
00:56:53.159 --> 00:56:55.537
-Over where?
-Over there.

878
00:56:55.620 --> 00:56:58.206
Just over there, over
the 20 garden fences?

879
00:56:58.915 --> 00:57:03.461
What's the matter, David,
never taken a shortcut before?

880
00:57:21.021 --> 00:57:25.775
Shaun, I'm sure Jill and
Derek live round here.

881
00:57:39.497 --> 00:57:43.168
Now, the Winchester is
just over that fence, all right?

882
00:57:43.251 --> 00:57:45.670
So, everyone stay
where they are. I'll...

883
00:57:45.754 --> 00:57:48.798
-Hang on, are we all here?
-One, two, three, four, five. Yes.

884
00:57:48.882 --> 00:57:50.634
-There's six of us.
-Oh.

885
00:57:52.052 --> 00:57:53.470
Mum!

886
00:57:55.722 --> 00:57:57.724
I'm coming!

887
00:57:57.807 --> 00:58:00.769
Mum, Mum! Mum, are
you okay? Are you okay?

888
00:58:00.852 --> 00:58:03.688
I don't think Jill and
Derek do live here.

889
00:58:06.066 --> 00:58:07.192
Shaun?

890
00:58:10.987 --> 00:58:12.739
Are you all right?

891
00:58:30.924 --> 00:58:32.550
What are you doing?

892
00:58:35.136 --> 00:58:36.554
DIANNE: Shaun!

893
00:58:40.183 --> 00:58:41.518
Yes!

894
00:58:44.104 --> 00:58:45.772
No, that's rubbish.

895
00:58:53.363 --> 00:58:55.115
-Oh!
-Yes!

896
00:58:57.617 --> 00:58:59.869
Feel free to step in any time!

897
00:58:59.953 --> 00:59:02.497
-You did all right.
-I didn't want to cramp your style.

898
00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:04.874
-Why?
-I'm so sorry about that.

899
00:59:07.085 --> 00:59:08.461
Right.

900
00:59:10.672 --> 00:59:14.509
Okay, everyone just stay where they
are. I'm gonna check if the coast is clear.

901
00:59:24.018 --> 00:59:26.146
-Is it clear?
-No.

902
00:59:26.229 --> 00:59:27.981
-LIZ: How many?
-Lots.

903
00:59:38.533 --> 00:59:41.578
Oh, well, that is just great.

904
00:59:41.661 --> 00:59:43.538
There are a fair
few of them, yes.

905
00:59:43.621 --> 00:59:46.791
I trust Shaun has another
genius scheme up his sleeve?

906
00:59:46.875 --> 00:59:49.252
This is hardly
constructive, David!

907
00:59:49.335 --> 00:59:50.336
No, Lizzie, this
is a waste of time.

908
00:59:51.504 --> 00:59:52.504
We should have
stayed at the flat.

909
00:59:52.547 --> 00:59:53.840
-Yeah, why didn't you?
-Because...

910
00:59:53.923 --> 00:59:57.677
-Because...
-Because, because of Captain Wow!

911
00:59:57.761 --> 00:59:58.762
Will you stop it!

912
00:59:58.845 --> 01:00:00.930
Yes, we're not gonna
get anywhere by moaning.

913
01:00:09.814 --> 01:00:14.944
Right, let's all shake out.
Get nice and limber. Or not.

914
01:00:15.028 --> 01:00:18.782
Now, take another look at the way
he moves. Remember, very limp.

915
01:00:18.865 --> 01:00:20.450
Almost like sleepwalking.

916
01:00:20.533 --> 01:00:24.662
Look at the face, it's
vacant with a hint of sadness.

917
01:00:24.746 --> 01:00:26.873
Like a drunk who's lost a bet.

918
01:00:26.956 --> 01:00:29.209
Okay, let's try, shall we? Liz.

919
01:00:32.879 --> 01:00:37.133
Nice, good vocal work.
Okay. Barbara, that's excellent.

920
01:00:37.884 --> 01:00:39.886
Sorry, dear, I was miles away.

921
01:00:40.345 --> 01:00:41.345
Daffs.

922
01:00:42.514 --> 01:00:43.514
Come on!

923
01:00:44.682 --> 01:00:48.269
Okay. It's mournful, sorrowful,
you're dead, and you hate it. Go.

924
01:00:49.979 --> 01:00:51.564
Much better. Ed.

925
01:00:51.648 --> 01:00:54.234
-I'll do it on the night.
-This is the night!

926
01:00:55.693 --> 01:00:57.654
-What is that?
-What about yours?

927
01:00:57.737 --> 01:01:00.657
Who died and made you
fucking king of the zombies?

928
01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:02.075
Don't.

929
01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:08.665
-Yeah, that's pretty good.
-Okay, right.

930
01:01:08.748 --> 01:01:10.333
Let's all try
together, shall we?

931
01:01:10.416 --> 01:01:13.086
One, two, three.

932
01:02:06.472 --> 01:02:10.018
Go, go, go, go.

933
01:02:11.394 --> 01:02:14.188
Shit. Get round
me, get round me.

934
01:02:14.272 --> 01:02:19.027
John? John, Bernie, are you there? It's
Shaun and Ed. We come in all the time.

935
01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:21.529
-They can hear you.
-We do the quiz.

936
01:02:21.613 --> 01:02:23.239
-They know.
-Stay in character, Daffs!

937
01:02:23.323 --> 01:02:26.409
-I can't see them.
-Shaun, we have to get inside.

938
01:02:26.492 --> 01:02:28.578
-Break the window.
-Don't be stupid, we'll be totally exposed!

939
01:02:28.661 --> 01:02:30.288
We are totally exposed.
Break the window!

940
01:02:30.371 --> 01:02:32.624
-Is there another way in?
-Well, yeah, there's...

941
01:02:35.501 --> 01:02:37.003
Two seconds.

942
01:02:37.086 --> 01:02:38.838
-Hey, Noodle.
-You all right, mate?

943
01:02:38.922 --> 01:02:40.965
-Yeah, man, I can't really talk now.
-Did you get anything yet?

944
01:02:41.049 --> 01:02:42.425
-I got nothing.
-Really?

945
01:02:42.508 --> 01:02:44.802
-No, I'm right in the middle of something.
-A bit mentalist, isn't it?

946
01:02:44.886 --> 01:02:48.097
Yeah, it's weird, isn't it?
Oil What are you doing?

947
01:02:48.181 --> 01:02:50.516
What am I doing? What are
you doing, you stupid moron?

948
01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:52.769
-Fuck off.
-You fuck off!

949
01:02:52.852 --> 01:02:54.854
Fuck fucking off!

950
01:02:54.938 --> 01:02:57.231
-LIZ: Shaun...
-I've spent an entire life... Look at me.

951
01:02:57.315 --> 01:02:59.525
I've spent my entire life
sticking my neck out for you,

952
01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:01.319
and all you ever
do is fuck things up!

953
01:03:01.402 --> 01:03:03.112
Fuck things up and
make me look stupid!

954
01:03:03.196 --> 01:03:05.949
Well, I'm not gonna let you
do it anymore. Not today.

955
01:03:06.032 --> 01:03:07.283
LIZ: Shaun...

956
01:03:08.868 --> 01:03:09.911
Oh.

957
01:03:17.669 --> 01:03:21.297
-You were saying about another way in?
-Yeah, there's a...

958
01:03:22.715 --> 01:03:24.509
What are you doing?

959
01:03:25.426 --> 01:03:26.469
No!

960
01:03:28.054 --> 01:03:29.973
-Get inside!
-No, they'll follow us!

961
01:03:30.056 --> 01:03:31.140
-What?
-They'll follow us.

962
01:03:31.224 --> 01:03:32.684
Just keep up the act, I'm
gonna have to do something.

963
01:03:32.767 --> 01:03:34.268
What do you mean,
"Do something"?

964
01:03:34.352 --> 01:03:36.479
Hello, hello, over
here, over here!

965
01:03:36.562 --> 01:03:41.067
Come on, come on, that's it, yeah,
come on, come on, that's it, over here!

966
01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:43.528
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
over here! Yeah, come on!

967
01:03:43.611 --> 01:03:46.155
Oh, bollocks. Okay, wait
till I've gone, then get inside!

968
01:03:46.239 --> 01:03:47.240
-Gone where?
-Gone where?

969
01:03:47.323 --> 01:03:48.700
I won't be long, I promise.

970
01:03:48.783 --> 01:03:53.997
Come on, you pasty-faced fuckers,
let's go! Follow me. Come on, let's go!

971
01:03:54.414 --> 01:03:58.668
Come on, this way, this way, that's it,
come on! Come on. This way, follow me.

972
01:03:58.751 --> 01:04:00.962
Come on, follow me. Come on!

973
01:04:01.045 --> 01:04:04.215
Come and get it!
It's a running buffet!

974
01:04:04.298 --> 01:04:06.342
All you can eat!

975
01:04:06.718 --> 01:04:08.469
Shall we go in, then?

976
01:04:16.936 --> 01:04:20.314
-Come on, Barbara. Leave those.
-I think they're for me.

977
01:04:40.501 --> 01:04:43.212
-He's been gone a good 20 minutes.
-Seventeen.

978
01:04:43.296 --> 01:04:46.758
Either way, we need to think
about blocking up this window here.

979
01:04:46.841 --> 01:04:48.384
We're totally exposed.

980
01:04:48.468 --> 01:04:52.138
-How will Shaun get back in?
-I'm sure he'll knock.

981
01:04:53.973 --> 01:04:56.225
Oh, for goodness sake,
let's get some lights on here.

982
01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:57.685
David, wait!

983
01:04:58.478 --> 01:05:00.730
-Power's off.
-That's a good thing.

984
01:05:00.813 --> 01:05:03.274
We don't want to advertise our
whereabouts more than we already have.

985
01:05:03.357 --> 01:05:05.985
-No, of course not.
-Do we, David?

986
01:05:06.652 --> 01:05:10.448
No, of course not, Lizzie.
I'm just being proactive.

987
01:05:10.948 --> 01:05:13.159
There's no lights, there's no
power. Where are the owners?

988
01:05:13.242 --> 01:05:15.203
And there's that bloody
great hole in the window.

989
01:05:15.286 --> 01:05:17.663
-You did that, you twat!
-Somebody had to do something!

990
01:05:17.747 --> 01:05:20.625
I don't know if you noticed back
there, but we were in a spot of bother.

991
01:05:20.708 --> 01:05:22.293
Somebody has to take
control of the situation,

992
01:05:22.376 --> 01:05:27.006
and if none of you are prepared
to accept that responsibility

993
01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:30.093
then perhaps I should.

994
01:05:30.718 --> 01:05:32.428
Will Shaun be gone long?

995
01:05:32.512 --> 01:05:34.806
-LIZ: He'll be back soon.
-How can you know that?

996
01:05:34.889 --> 01:05:36.557
I don't think he'd
leave us, Daffs.

997
01:05:36.641 --> 01:05:39.519
Wouldn't he? Lizzie, how
can you put your faith in a man

998
01:05:39.602 --> 01:05:42.855
you spectacularly binned
for being unreliable?

999
01:05:42.939 --> 01:05:44.816
A man whose idea
of a romantic nightspot

1000
01:05:44.899 --> 01:05:46.984
and an impenetrable
fortress are the same thing.

1001
01:05:47.068 --> 01:05:50.863
This is a pub! We are in a
pub! What are we going to do?

1002
01:05:51.489 --> 01:05:52.698
I could get a round in.

1003
01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:55.618
Look, let's just keep
quiet and wait for Shaun.

1004
01:05:55.701 --> 01:05:57.537
We can barricade the
window when he gets back.

1005
01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:00.414
What then? How long?
Days? Weeks? A month?

1006
01:06:00.498 --> 01:06:01.958
What about food? What
are we going to eat?

1007
01:06:02.041 --> 01:06:04.085
-Toasties!
-Yeah, there's a Breville out back.

1008
01:06:04.168 --> 01:06:06.003
Oh, great, then!
Saved by nibbles!

1009
01:06:06.087 --> 01:06:08.714
That must be why Shaun took
us here before he buggered off.

1010
01:06:08.798 --> 01:06:12.969
-He's coming back!
-Why? Because he promised?

1011
01:06:13.052 --> 01:06:15.638
And even if he does, do you think
his master plan's going to extend

1012
01:06:15.721 --> 01:06:18.432
to anything more than sitting
and eating peanuts in the dark?

1013
01:06:18.516 --> 01:06:21.185
What, is he just gonna stroll in and
suddenly everything's gonna be okay?

1014
01:06:21.269 --> 01:06:23.896
I don't know, David!

1015
01:06:24.397 --> 01:06:25.940
I don't know any
more than you do.

1016
01:06:26.023 --> 01:06:30.862
But what I do know is that we're here
now and we have to make the best of it!

1017
01:06:32.405 --> 01:06:35.324
-Ed, get me a double vodka.
-Right you are.

1018
01:06:35.408 --> 01:06:37.160
Think I'll have a
drink, too, actually.

1019
01:06:37.243 --> 01:06:39.162
-Would you like a drink, Barbara?
-Hello.

1020
01:06:39.245 --> 01:06:41.455
Right, great, fuck it. That's
what we'll do, that's what we'll do.

1021
01:06:41.539 --> 01:06:44.167
We'll all have a party. How about
that? We all get completely smashed.

1022
01:06:44.250 --> 01:06:48.171
Oh, look, we've got our nibbles.
We've got our Mini Cheddars...

1023
01:06:48.254 --> 01:06:49.839
-David!
-We got Twiglets.

1024
01:06:49.922 --> 01:06:52.091
Oh, look, Hog Lumps.

1025
01:06:57.263 --> 01:07:00.766
-Pickle.
-Hello, Mum. You all right?

1026
01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:02.518
-Everybody okay?
-Yeah.

1027
01:07:02.602 --> 01:07:04.312
-Any sign of John and Bernie?
-We haven't seen them.

1028
01:07:04.395 --> 01:07:06.147
-Check upstairs?
-I think it's locked.

1029
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:09.650
-What's the phone situation?
-Dead. Same as the power.

1030
01:07:09.734 --> 01:07:11.694
SHAUN: Okay.

1031
01:07:11.777 --> 01:07:13.696
Nice of you to join us.

1032
01:07:14.071 --> 01:07:16.866
Yeah, well, I
promised, didn't I?

1033
01:07:22.330 --> 01:07:24.790
How did you lose them?

1034
01:07:26.792 --> 01:07:30.338
I just gave them the slip. Wasn't
difficult. They're not all that.

1035
01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:32.173
Well, how did you get in?

1036
01:07:32.256 --> 01:07:33.883
There is a back door, David.

1037
01:07:33.966 --> 01:07:36.052
I tried to tell you before you
went and smashed the window.

1038
01:07:36.135 --> 01:07:39.555
Well, I wasn't the one who was blowing our
cover by having a tiff with my boyfriend.

1039
01:07:39.639 --> 01:07:41.057
He's not my boyfriend.

1040
01:07:41.724 --> 01:07:43.559
Might be a bit
warm, the cooler's off.

1041
01:07:43.643 --> 01:07:44.977
Thanks, babe.

1042
01:07:46.771 --> 01:07:48.773
So, what's the plan, then?

1043
01:07:51.484 --> 01:07:54.278
Would anyone like a peanut?

1044
01:08:03.663 --> 01:08:05.790
Why don't you do your Clyde?

1045
01:08:05.873 --> 01:08:08.626
Oh, come... Has anyone seen
Every Which Way But Loose?

1046
01:08:08.709 --> 01:08:11.379
Ed does the most amazing
impression of the orangutan.

1047
01:08:11.462 --> 01:08:14.257
-No, it's not.
-It is. Come on. Do it.

1048
01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:16.384
-No, no.
-But it's brilliant. Come on, just do it.

1049
01:08:16.467 --> 01:08:17.593
Do it, it'll work.
Come on, just do it.

1050
01:08:17.677 --> 01:08:19.095
You've built it up too
much, I feel uncomfortable.

1051
01:08:19.178 --> 01:08:21.305
-No, you don't. Just do it.
-DIANNE: Oh, come on, do it.

1052
01:08:21.389 --> 01:08:23.182
See. Everyone wants to see
it. We could do with a laugh.

1053
01:08:23.266 --> 01:08:25.851
-Do it, do it, do it, do it.
-DIANNE: Come on, do it.

1054
01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:28.062
I'm not a performing monkey.

1055
01:08:30.982 --> 01:08:33.693
-The power's on.
-It's not, I tried it earlier.

1056
01:08:33.776 --> 01:08:35.945
No, but the streetlights have
come on. It means the grid isn't out.

1057
01:08:36.028 --> 01:08:38.155
It's the fuses. I'll just flip them
back on, we can watch television.

1058
01:08:38.239 --> 01:08:39.282
LIZ: What about the lights?

1059
01:08:39.365 --> 01:08:42.326
Yes, we don't want to advertise our
whereabouts more than we already have.

1060
01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:45.538
The lights operate on a separate
circuit, I'll just flip the mains breakers.

1061
01:08:45.663 --> 01:08:47.665
It's quite simple, David.

1062
01:09:16.319 --> 01:09:18.612
-Is that it?
-LIZ: That's it!

1063
01:09:45.306 --> 01:09:48.934
Liz, have you got a quid?

1064
01:09:53.606 --> 01:09:55.107
Yeah.

1065
01:10:00.112 --> 01:10:02.239
Never anything on, is there?

1066
01:10:06.535 --> 01:10:07.620
What?

1067
01:10:10.623 --> 01:10:12.792
I think we might have
a bit of a problem.

1068
01:10:13.542 --> 01:10:15.169
What do you mean?

1069
01:10:18.381 --> 01:10:19.632
They followed me.

1070
01:10:20.424 --> 01:10:22.760
I thought you said
you gave them the slip.

1071
01:10:22.843 --> 01:10:23.969
Yeah.

1072
01:10:25.930 --> 01:10:29.392
Well, we'll just have to be
extra quiet, then, won't we?

1073
01:10:31.143 --> 01:10:32.395
What?

1074
01:10:34.772 --> 01:10:36.482
-Ed, no!
-Ed, no!

1075
01:10:37.316 --> 01:10:38.859
Turn it off!

1076
01:11:11.142 --> 01:11:12.476
Shit!

1077
01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:15.062
-Where the hell did he come from?
-I don't know.

1078
01:11:19.150 --> 01:11:21.318
-Who the hell put this on?
-It's on random.

1079
01:11:21.402 --> 01:11:22.445
For fuck's sake!

1080
01:11:22.528 --> 01:11:25.948
Okay, Dianne, get Mum somewhere
safe. David, kill the Queen.

1081
01:11:26.031 --> 01:11:27.241
-What?
-The jukebox!

1082
01:11:27.324 --> 01:11:28.868
Liz, Ed, grab something weapony.

1083
01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:30.911
-ED: What about the rifle?
-It's not real!

1084
01:11:30.995 --> 01:11:32.288
-Cocktails?
-What do you mean?

1085
01:11:32.371 --> 01:11:36.167
The flaming spirits. Drambuie,
Sambuca, brandy. Get a rag in. Light it.

1086
01:11:36.250 --> 01:11:37.918
-But the whole place could go up.
-What, then?

1087
01:11:39.044 --> 01:11:40.379
How about pool?

1088
01:11:46.886 --> 01:11:49.430
Okay, John, it's
time at the bar!

1089
01:12:08.949 --> 01:12:12.411
-I can't find the switches!
-Well, then get the fuses!

1090
01:12:46.278 --> 01:12:49.114
-Why is Queen still on?
-We have a situation!

1091
01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:50.282
I know!

1092
01:12:51.492 --> 01:12:52.535
-Fuck this.
-Ed!

1093
01:12:52.618 --> 01:12:54.161
Two seconds.

1094
01:12:54.245 --> 01:12:55.287
Oil

1095
01:13:03.212 --> 01:13:04.797
Shaun!

1096
01:13:07.967 --> 01:13:09.009
No!

1097
01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:13.305
Yes! Yes! In the head!

1098
01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:19.770
Shauny!

1099
01:13:35.619 --> 01:13:38.122
Why didn't you just
shoot him, man?

1100
01:13:39.623 --> 01:13:41.500
Ed, for the last time, it's...

1101
01:13:45.254 --> 01:13:46.964
I fucking knew it!

1102
01:13:47.047 --> 01:13:49.550
What did I tell you?
Big Al was right.

1103
01:13:49.633 --> 01:13:50.718
Okay,

1104
01:13:55.139 --> 01:13:57.099
but dogs can look up.

1105
01:14:00.686 --> 01:14:02.938
-Okay, has anyone fired a gun before?
-Oh, yeah.

1106
01:14:03.022 --> 01:14:04.940
-Apart from Ed?
-I'm a pacifist.

1107
01:14:05.024 --> 01:14:06.150
Apart from David and Ed?

1108
01:14:06.233 --> 01:14:07.735
Sorry, what was Ed's experience?

1109
01:14:07.818 --> 01:14:09.987
He shot his sister in
the leg with an air rifle.

1110
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:11.113
I think you should do it.

1111
01:14:11.196 --> 01:14:13.741
-I think we should all do it.
-How can five people operate one gun?

1112
01:14:13.824 --> 01:14:16.952
None of us have any real experience,
okay? Now, we've only got...

1113
01:14:17.036 --> 01:14:18.621
-Twenty-nine.
-Twenty-nine bullets.

1114
01:14:18.704 --> 01:14:20.456
-Call them "shells."
-We've only got 29 shells,

1115
01:14:20.539 --> 01:14:21.915
we really need to
work together on this.

1116
01:14:21.999 --> 01:14:25.127
I need someone to help me reload,
everyone else to look out. I will fire.

1117
01:14:25.210 --> 01:14:26.503
As Bertrand Russell once said,

1118
01:14:26.587 --> 01:14:29.798
“The only thing that will
redeem mankind Is cooperation."

1119
01:14:29.882 --> 01:14:33.052
I think we can all appreciate
the relevance of that now.

1120
01:14:33.135 --> 01:14:34.470
Was that on the
back of a beer mat?

1121
01:14:34.553 --> 01:14:35.929
Yeah, it was
Guinness Extra Cold.

1122
01:14:36.013 --> 01:14:37.556
-I won't say anything.
-Thanks.

1123
01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:42.895
-They definitely want to come in.
-Get Mum out of the way.

1124
01:14:43.812 --> 01:14:46.649
David, Dianne, let's go.
Ed, give me some shells.

1125
01:14:48.776 --> 01:14:51.195
-LIZ: Barbara?
-Oh, hello.

1126
01:14:51.278 --> 01:14:54.031
-Would you like to come with me?
-That would be lovely.

1127
01:14:56.075 --> 01:14:58.369
It's nice to meet you, finally.

1128
01:14:59.536 --> 01:15:01.205
Shaun's always
talking about you.

1129
01:15:01.288 --> 01:15:02.665
-Really?
-Yeah.

1130
01:15:03.916 --> 01:15:05.125
Barbara?

1131
01:15:06.919 --> 01:15:08.629
Are you all right?

1132
01:15:09.088 --> 01:15:11.215
I've got something for you.

1133
01:15:12.591 --> 01:15:16.053
Shaun's father gave me this.
Shaun's real father, I mean.

1134
01:15:16.136 --> 01:15:18.013
I'd like you to have it.

1135
01:15:18.097 --> 01:15:21.392
-Barbara, Shaun and I have...
-It seems only right.

1136
01:15:37.533 --> 01:15:41.412
I didn't want to say anything. I
thought Shaun would be worried.

1137
01:15:43.122 --> 01:15:46.250
SHAUN: Liz? DAVID:
Here they come!

1138
01:15:48.127 --> 01:15:50.254
SHAUN: Stay behind me! Stay
behind me! DIANNE: There's one!

1139
01:15:50.337 --> 01:15:51.380
Sorry, we're closed!

1140
01:15:53.632 --> 01:15:55.384
-Try the safety button.
-Yeah, that happened to me on stage.

1141
01:15:55.467 --> 01:15:56.719
Cock it!

1142
01:16:04.810 --> 01:16:06.395
-Over there!
-Over where?

1143
01:16:06.478 --> 01:16:07.813
3200.

1144
01:16:14.027 --> 01:16:15.988
Over there again.
Quarter to twelve.

1145
01:16:16.071 --> 01:16:17.489
What?

1146
01:16:17.573 --> 01:16:19.742
-11:45.
-Keep it simple!

1147
01:16:21.118 --> 01:16:22.369
Top left.

1148
01:16:24.663 --> 01:16:26.415
-Reload.
-I'm on it!

1149
01:16:32.755 --> 01:16:34.256
Nice shot.

1150
01:16:34.339 --> 01:16:37.050
Okay, David, Dianne,
let's block up this window!

1151
01:16:37.134 --> 01:16:38.886
Ed, take over a sec.

1152
01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:43.223
SHAUN: What is it? What's
wrong? LIZ: Shaun, I'm so sorry.

1153
01:16:43.307 --> 01:16:46.518
-Mum, what's wrong?
-I didn't want to be a bother.

1154
01:16:49.855 --> 01:16:51.732
Mum, I don't understand.

1155
01:16:51.815 --> 01:16:53.776
The man in his pajamas...

1156
01:16:53.859 --> 01:16:56.570
I didn't want to say anything,
I thought you'd be upset.

1157
01:16:56.653 --> 01:16:58.655
No, you should've said.

1158
01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:02.242
-Take over a sec.
-DIANNE: What?

1159
01:17:02.326 --> 01:17:04.703
-What's going on?
-ED: What's up? What's wrong?

1160
01:17:04.787 --> 01:17:06.747
-What the hell's going on?
-Barbara's hurt!

1161
01:17:06.830 --> 01:17:08.957
-Mum.
-Just take over a minute.

1162
01:17:09.041 --> 01:17:12.211
-Jesus.
-DIANNE: I know first aid.

1163
01:17:13.378 --> 01:17:17.591
-SHAUN: Just hang on. Mum? Mum?
-Is she...

1164
01:17:17.674 --> 01:17:18.926
DIANNE: Shaun...

1165
01:17:19.009 --> 01:17:21.386
Just hold on, Mum,
you're gonna be fine.

1166
01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:24.056
-I never thanked you.
-For what?

1167
01:17:25.641 --> 01:17:29.311
For these. "To a wonderful mum."

1168
01:17:31.438 --> 01:17:34.233
It's been a funny
sort of day, hasn't it?

1169
01:17:35.359 --> 01:17:40.447
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Come on, Mum,
come on, Mum, stop it, stop it, stop it.

1170
01:17:40.531 --> 01:17:44.159
Don't,
Mum. Please don't go.

1171
01:17:55.045 --> 01:17:57.339
-What are you doing?
-We have to deal with her.

1172
01:17:57.422 --> 01:18:00.092
-Daffs!
-For Christ's sake!

1173
01:18:00.175 --> 01:18:02.427
-She's gonna come back!
-SHAUN: She's not gone anywhere.

1174
01:18:02.511 --> 01:18:05.681
-Well, she'll change.
-She's my mum.

1175
01:18:05.764 --> 01:18:08.642
-She's a zombie.
-Don't say that!

1176
01:18:08.725 --> 01:18:11.687
Move aside. I'm
gonna count to three.

1177
01:18:11.770 --> 01:18:15.274
One, two, three!

1178
01:18:15.983 --> 01:18:17.734
Don't point that gun at my mum!

1179
01:18:17.818 --> 01:18:19.528
Shaun, calm down!

1180
01:18:19.611 --> 01:18:21.196
Don't point that gun at Barbara!

1181
01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:23.282
-Ed, don't exacerbate things!
-What does that mean?

1182
01:18:23.365 --> 01:18:25.492
This isn't exactly fair!

1183
01:18:25.576 --> 01:18:26.910
-Here.
-Thank you.

1184
01:18:26.994 --> 01:18:28.495
ED: It's okay.

1185
01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:32.165
Please, can we just
stop and think about this?

1186
01:18:32.249 --> 01:18:34.376
Tell him to put the gun down!

1187
01:18:34.459 --> 01:18:36.712
Look, Lizzie, she's gonna
change. You know I'm right.

1188
01:18:36.795 --> 01:18:39.923
And when she does, she'll
come back and she'll kill all of us.

1189
01:18:40.007 --> 01:18:41.758
That's what your ex
can't seem to realize.

1190
01:18:41.842 --> 01:18:43.552
That's what this
is about, isn't it?

1191
01:18:43.635 --> 01:18:45.470
It's just... He just...
He doesn't like me!

1192
01:18:45.554 --> 01:18:47.764
He's always hated me and
now he wants to shoot my mum!

1193
01:18:47.848 --> 01:18:48.849
She's not...

1194
01:18:48.932 --> 01:18:51.351
You've never thought I deserved
her, that I was good enough.

1195
01:18:51.435 --> 01:18:52.435
What are you talking about?

1196
01:18:52.477 --> 01:18:55.188
Oh, come on, we all
know you're in love with Liz!

1197
01:18:55.272 --> 01:18:56.356
That is not true!

1198
01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:58.275
-SHAUN: Yes, it is!
-That is not true.

1199
01:18:58.358 --> 01:19:00.319
-DIANNE: Yes, it is.
-What?

1200
01:19:00.402 --> 01:19:03.906
I know you only hung out with
me at college to get close to Liz.

1201
01:19:03.989 --> 01:19:06.909
And when she knocked you back,
I was there to pick up the pieces.

1202
01:19:06.992 --> 01:19:10.370
I've come to terms with
that, Daffs, why can't you?

1203
01:19:11.413 --> 01:19:14.499
Lizzie, I want you to know that my feelings
for you have always been essentially...

1204
01:19:14.583 --> 01:19:18.086
David, please! There are slightly
more pressing matters at hand here!

1205
01:19:18.170 --> 01:19:20.756
Like the fact that "Daffs" is
pointing a gun at my mum!

1206
01:19:20.839 --> 01:19:23.091
I'm not the one who's
being unreasonable, "Pickle."

1207
01:19:23.175 --> 01:19:24.927
For Christ's sake,
she's not dead!

1208
01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:28.013
She's finished! For a hero,
you're quite a hypocrite!

1209
01:19:28.096 --> 01:19:31.141
You're the one that's gone from being a
Chartered Accountant to Charlton Heston!

1210
01:19:31.224 --> 01:19:34.394
-I'm not a Chartered Accountant!
-Well, you look like one!

1211
01:19:34.478 --> 01:19:36.355
-Yeah!
-I'm a lecturer!

1212
01:19:36.438 --> 01:19:38.315
-You're a twat!
-Yeah!

1213
01:19:38.398 --> 01:19:42.069
She's not your mum anymore! In a
minute she'll be just another zombie!

1214
01:19:42.152 --> 01:19:44.863
-Don't say that.
-We're not using the Z word.

1215
01:19:44.947 --> 01:19:49.868
Please, can we just
calm the fuck down?

1216
01:19:51.161 --> 01:19:54.873
Now, I can see what
David is trying to say...

1217
01:19:54.957 --> 01:19:57.209
-Thank you, Lizzie.
-...even if he is being a twat!

1218
01:19:57.292 --> 01:19:58.335
Yep.

1219
01:19:59.378 --> 01:20:02.464
And, Shaun, Shaun, look at me.

1220
01:20:04.591 --> 01:20:08.303
I can't begin to imagine
how hard this must be for you,

1221
01:20:08.387 --> 01:20:10.847
but we can't
afford to fall apart.

1222
01:20:12.057 --> 01:20:16.478
Shaun, babe, I know
you don't wanna hear this.

1223
01:20:35.998 --> 01:20:37.332
You do it.

1224
01:20:48.093 --> 01:20:49.636
I'm sorry, Mum.

1225
01:20:51.638 --> 01:20:52.806
Do it!

1226
01:21:08.947 --> 01:21:13.452
Well, I think we're all agreed,
you did the right thing there.

1227
01:21:19.124 --> 01:21:21.001
David, no!

1228
01:21:22.878 --> 01:21:23.295
-David.
-Right, I'm leaving.

1229
01:21:23.296 --> 01:21:26.715
-David.
-Right, I'm leaving.

1230
01:21:26.798 --> 01:21:28.550
-What?
-I'm not staying here.

1231
01:21:28.633 --> 01:21:31.970
-David, don't, it's suicide.
-I think you should go.

1232
01:21:32.054 --> 01:21:33.805
We will. We can run,
we can defend ourselves.

1233
01:21:33.889 --> 01:21:36.808
-What do you mean "we?"
-What do you mean, "What do I mean "we?"

1234
01:21:36.892 --> 01:21:40.562
Opening that door now would
be a very, very silly thing to do.

1235
01:21:40.645 --> 01:21:42.064
So, are you gonna
stay here with him?

1236
01:21:42.147 --> 01:21:43.815
-Look, Shaun...
-After everything he's gotten us into!

1237
01:21:43.899 --> 01:21:45.650
You let me finish!

1238
01:21:45.734 --> 01:21:49.154
Shaun didn't ask you to come here.
You came for the same reason that I did,

1239
01:21:49.237 --> 01:21:52.074
'cause you didn't know what else to
do. Get away from that door this instant!

1240
01:21:52.157 --> 01:21:53.784
-But...
-David!

1241
01:22:02.834 --> 01:22:03.960
I'm so sorry, Dianne.

1242
01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:08.673
Maybe I'm not the one you
should be apologizing to.

1243
01:22:10.509 --> 01:22:11.718
Shaun...

1244
01:22:17.557 --> 01:22:20.060
David! No!

1245
01:22:20.143 --> 01:22:23.021
No, no, no, no!

1246
01:22:23.897 --> 01:22:25.315
David!

1247
01:22:26.149 --> 01:22:27.275
No, no!

1248
01:22:27.359 --> 01:22:28.860
David!

1249
01:22:49.339 --> 01:22:50.841
David!

1250
01:22:52.092 --> 01:22:53.969
-Dianne, no!
-Dianne, no!

1251
01:22:54.052 --> 01:22:55.178
I'm coming, David!

1252
01:22:56.012 --> 01:22:58.306
David! David!

1253
01:23:01.893 --> 01:23:03.186
Oh, dear.

1254
01:23:03.645 --> 01:23:05.355
-Cocktails?
-Do it.

1255
01:23:16.449 --> 01:23:17.868
Stay back!

1256
01:23:23.665 --> 01:23:25.292
Shaun, hold them!

1257
01:23:28.795 --> 01:23:29.880
Heads!

1258
01:23:34.342 --> 01:23:36.261
-Ed!
-Hurry up!

1259
01:23:37.846 --> 01:23:39.764
Shauny, look who it is.

1260
01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:42.058
Fuck-a-doodle-doo!

1261
01:23:44.603 --> 01:23:45.854
Ed!

1262
01:23:46.354 --> 01:23:48.106
-Shaun!
-Ed!

1263
01:23:48.190 --> 01:23:50.025
Don't groan at
me, you thick fuck!

1264
01:23:50.358 --> 01:23:52.110
I can't hold them!

1265
01:23:55.655 --> 01:23:56.907
No!

1266
01:24:00.869 --> 01:24:02.829
-Shaun!
-Pete!

1267
01:24:05.207 --> 01:24:07.375
I said, leave him alone!

1268
01:24:10.462 --> 01:24:13.715
Ed! Ed!

1269
01:24:13.798 --> 01:24:15.967
Shaun, bar!

1270
01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:28.980
Ed!

1271
01:24:30.190 --> 01:24:31.483
Ed!

1272
01:24:33.068 --> 01:24:34.236
Ed!

1273
01:24:35.362 --> 01:24:36.488
What?

1274
01:24:37.572 --> 01:24:39.616
Chuck us a cloth will you?

1275
01:24:52.379 --> 01:24:54.756
-Where are the shells?
-They're on the bar.

1276
01:24:54.839 --> 01:24:56.174
Oh, fuck!

1277
01:24:59.928 --> 01:25:01.179
Fuck it!

1278
01:25:02.722 --> 01:25:04.724
What are we gonna do?
Where are we gonna go?

1279
01:25:04.808 --> 01:25:06.935
-The cellar!
-Maybe we can get out.

1280
01:25:07.018 --> 01:25:09.104
There's a barrel hatch
that leads into the street.

1281
01:25:09.187 --> 01:25:10.814
You mean go back outside?

1282
01:25:12.691 --> 01:25:15.026
Oh, give us a fucking break!

1283
01:25:21.199 --> 01:25:22.450
-Go!
-Go!

1284
01:25:33.253 --> 01:25:35.046
I can see the street.

1285
01:25:36.673 --> 01:25:37.882
Come on.

1286
01:25:39.301 --> 01:25:40.760
Come on!

1287
01:25:42.137 --> 01:25:44.347
Why won't it open?

1288
01:25:54.899 --> 01:25:56.985
That's it, isn't it?
We're trapped.

1289
01:25:57.068 --> 01:25:58.987
"Hey, let's go to
the Winchester!"

1290
01:25:59.070 --> 01:26:01.239
Whose fucking idea was that?

1291
01:26:01.323 --> 01:26:03.575
Man, I've really
ballsed this up.

1292
01:26:07.162 --> 01:26:10.832
-No, you haven't.
-I have, Liz. I couldn't save us.

1293
01:26:10.915 --> 01:26:15.920
I couldn't save Di or David. I couldn't
even save my mum. I'm useless.

1294
01:26:16.004 --> 01:26:19.299
You shouldn't feel so
responsible, you tried.

1295
01:26:19.382 --> 01:26:21.760
You did something,
that's what counts.

1296
01:26:23.428 --> 01:26:25.055
Yeah, I suppose.

1297
01:26:28.516 --> 01:26:31.936
-Do you think they'll get through?
-Yeah.

1298
01:26:34.105 --> 01:26:36.316
How many shells
have we got left?

1299
01:26:38.943 --> 01:26:43.615
Two. I suppose we could take a
few of them out if they stand in a line.

1300
01:26:44.949 --> 01:26:48.703
-I wasn't thinking about them.
-I know.

1301
01:26:53.875 --> 01:26:55.585
What about Ed?
There's only two shells.

1302
01:26:55.668 --> 01:26:57.670
ED: I don't mind being eaten.

1303
01:27:02.842 --> 01:27:04.844
How are we gonna do this?

1304
01:27:05.261 --> 01:27:06.763
I don't know.

1305
01:27:07.472 --> 01:27:09.474
One of us has to go first.

1306
01:27:09.557 --> 01:27:12.894
Maybe one should do the
other and then do themselves.

1307
01:27:12.977 --> 01:27:16.439
Maybe you should do me. I'll only
muck it up if I have to do myself.

1308
01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:27.075
Do you know, I don't
think I've got it in me

1309
01:27:27.158 --> 01:27:30.578
to shoot my flatmate, my mum and
my girlfriend all in the same evening.

1310
01:27:33.790 --> 01:27:35.500
What makes you think
I've taken you back?

1311
01:27:38.545 --> 01:27:40.922
You don't want to
die single, do you?

1312
01:27:41.005 --> 01:27:44.676
ED: Actually, I
would like to be shot.

1313
01:27:46.177 --> 01:27:50.014
Besides, I've changed. I haven't
had a fag since yesterday, I promise.

1314
01:27:50.098 --> 01:27:51.433
ED: He hasn't.

1315
01:27:54.269 --> 01:27:56.479
Maybe we should have one now.

1316
01:27:58.231 --> 01:28:01.276
-What...
-You left them in my flat.

1317
01:28:01.359 --> 01:28:04.654
-Yeah, in the bin.
-I was desperate.

1318
01:28:04.737 --> 01:28:07.782
-Sneaky monkey.
-Sorry.

1319
01:28:07.866 --> 01:28:09.659
I won't say anything.

1320
01:28:22.088 --> 01:28:24.632
Come on, we're
getting out of here.

1321
01:28:25.717 --> 01:28:28.803
-I might just stay here.
-Yeah, but we can get out.

1322
01:28:28.887 --> 01:28:32.265
-I think you two should make a go of it.
-What are you talking about?

1323
01:28:32.348 --> 01:28:35.727
-I only hold you back.
-Yeah, but...

1324
01:28:41.065 --> 01:28:43.151
Maybe you should have this.

1325
01:28:43.943 --> 01:28:45.778
Don't you want it?

1326
01:28:45.862 --> 01:28:48.907
No. I can't hit anything
with it anyway, I'm rubbish.

1327
01:28:52.452 --> 01:28:55.747
-Ed, I'm sorry.
-What for?

1328
01:28:57.165 --> 01:28:59.751
"Cause I was shouting
at you earlier on.

1329
01:28:59.834 --> 01:29:02.754
It's all right. I'm sorry, too.

1330
01:29:03.963 --> 01:29:08.384
-It's okay.
-No, I'm sorry, Shaun.

1331
01:29:11.679 --> 01:29:15.600
Oh, God, God. That's not funny.

1332
01:29:15.683 --> 01:29:17.852
I'll stop doing them
when you stop laughing.

1333
01:29:17.936 --> 01:29:19.562
SHAUN: I'm not laughing.

1334
01:29:33.326 --> 01:29:34.786
You better be off.

1335
01:29:44.295 --> 01:29:46.714
Bye, Ed. Love you.

1336
01:29:47.966 --> 01:29:49.008
Cheers.

1337
01:29:50.510 --> 01:29:52.303
I love you, too, man.

1338
01:29:55.807 --> 01:29:57.475
Gay!

1339
01:30:18.288 --> 01:30:21.124
-Ready?
-Ready.

1340
01:30:30.633 --> 01:30:35.346
SOLDIER: Section One.
Ready. Zombies to your front. Fire!

1341
01:30:36.431 --> 01:30:39.892
Section One. Targets
to your front. Fire!

1342
01:30:55.199 --> 01:30:59.203
-Oh, my God. Shaun!
-Yvonne?

1343
01:31:04.667 --> 01:31:05.960
How you doing?

1344
01:31:06.586 --> 01:31:07.962
-Surviving.
-Surviving.

1345
01:31:08.046 --> 01:31:10.214
They're taking us somewhere
safe. I thought you two might wanna...

1346
01:31:10.298 --> 01:31:12.467
-SOLDIER: Move it!
-...tag along.

1347
01:31:12.550 --> 01:31:14.552
Is it just the two of you?

1348
01:31:17.305 --> 01:31:20.224
Well, glad somebody made it.

1349
01:31:22.185 --> 01:31:23.394
Come on.

1350
01:31:37.241 --> 01:31:40.995
MAN ON TV: Next, we'll hear the
story of 10-year-old Enrique Romerez

1351
01:31:41.079 --> 01:31:44.582
who fought off the reanimated
corpses of his entire family.

1352
01:31:44.666 --> 01:31:48.086
It's all coming right up
on Zombies From Hell.

1353
01:31:48.336 --> 01:31:51.047
MALE REPORTER: Six months
on and to many the events of Z-day

1354
01:31:51.130 --> 01:31:53.091
must seem like a bad dream.

1355
01:31:53.174 --> 01:31:57.136
And as we now know, the phenomenon
resulted from the use of highly...

1356
01:31:57.220 --> 01:32:00.932
...not something I ever expected as
a newscaster to have to say on air.

1357
01:32:02.100 --> 01:32:05.228
"Removing the head or
destroying the brain." Incredible.

1358
01:32:05.353 --> 01:32:08.856
Dead excited now, to have a top
band with us, talking about their work,

1359
01:32:08.940 --> 01:32:10.692
for the charity Zombaid.

1360
01:32:10.775 --> 01:32:14.570
FEMALE REPORTER: The fact that the mobile
deceased retained their primal instincts

1361
01:32:14.654 --> 01:32:17.740
make them ideal recruitment
for the service industry.

1362
01:32:17.824 --> 01:32:20.451
As well as proving themselves
useful in other roles, such as...

1363
01:32:21.285 --> 01:32:25.456
MAN: He can't
quite get it. He's fallen, he's down!

1364
01:32:27.583 --> 01:32:29.001
I don't see nothing
wrong with it

1365
01:32:29.085 --> 01:32:31.546
but I know that some people
would see something wrong with it.

1366
01:32:31.629 --> 01:32:33.756
But he's my husband, you know.

1367
01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:36.926
I still love him, and I still got
the ring on my finger, Trisha.

1368
01:32:37.009 --> 01:32:38.219
You go to bed with it?

1369
01:32:38.302 --> 01:32:39.554
WOMAN: 'Course I do.

1370
01:32:40.388 --> 01:32:44.142
TRISHA: All right. Okay, you
can't understand why she's with him.

1371
01:32:44.809 --> 01:32:48.187
Okay, what do you say to people
that criticize you for being with...

1372
01:32:48.271 --> 01:32:49.272
WOMAN: Well, they don't have...

1373
01:32:49.355 --> 01:32:52.775
MALE REPORTER: ...initial claims that the
virus was caused by rage infected monkeys

1374
01:32:52.859 --> 01:32:54.736
have now been dismissed as...

1375
01:32:54.819 --> 01:32:56.070
Hello.

1376
01:33:02.118 --> 01:33:03.911
What's the plan, then?

1377
01:33:04.245 --> 01:33:07.248
Right, a cup of tea,

1378
01:33:07.331 --> 01:33:09.917
then we get the Sundays.

1379
01:33:10.001 --> 01:33:12.503
Head down the
Phoenix for a roast,

1380
01:33:12.587 --> 01:33:14.839
veg out in the pub for a bit,

1381
01:33:15.339 --> 01:33:18.509
then wander home, watch
a bit of telly, go to bed.

1382
01:33:18.593 --> 01:33:21.137
-Perfect.
-I'll get the kettle on.

1383
01:33:21.220 --> 01:33:22.680
Can I have two sugars, please?

1384
01:33:23.848 --> 01:33:25.475
Adventurous.

1385
01:33:25.558 --> 01:33:27.935
Actually, I might pop
into the garden for a bit.

1386
01:33:28.019 --> 01:33:29.979
Go on, then.

1387
01:33:30.062 --> 01:33:31.564
Two seconds.

1388
01:33:43.201 --> 01:33:45.536
MALE VOICE ON TV: Player
Two has entered the game.

1389
01:33:46.454 --> 01:33:47.622

1390
01:33:55.922 --> 01:33:57.089
