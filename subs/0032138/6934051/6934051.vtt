1
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.112
She isn't coming yet, Toto.

2
00:02:08.341 --> 00:02:09.640
Did she hurt you?

3
00:02:10.127 --> 00:02:11.766
She tried to, didn't she?

4
00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.634
Come on. We'll go tell Uncle Henry and Auntie Em.

5
00:02:14.637 --> 00:02:15.796
Come on, Toto.

6
00:02:23.726 --> 00:02:25.913
Aunt Em! Aunt Em!

7
00:02:26.477 --> 00:02:29.334
Aunt Em, just listen to what
Miss Gulch did to Toto!

8
00:02:29.337 --> 00:02:31.180
Dorothy, please! We're trying to count!

9
00:02:31.183 --> 00:02:32.242
Oh, but Aunt Em, she hit him over the...

10
00:02:32.307 --> 00:02:34.188
Don't bother us now, honey.

11
00:02:34.191 --> 00:02:36.197
This old incubator's gone bad

12
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.547
and we're likely to lose a lot of our chicks.

13
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.234
Oh... oh, the poor little things.

14
00:02:41.237 --> 00:02:42.497
Oh, but Aunt Em,

15
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.743
Miss Gulch hit Toto right over the
back with a rake just because

16
00:02:44.746 --> 00:02:48.040
she says he gets in her garden and
chases her nasty old cat every day!

17
00:02:48.043 --> 00:02:50.223
Seventy. Dorothy, please!

18
00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.587
Oh, but he doesn't do it every
day, just once or twice a week.

19
00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.537
And he can't catch her old cat anyway.

20
00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.467
And now she says she's gonna
get the sheriff, and...

21
00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.769
Dorothy! Dorothy! We're busy!

22
00:03:01.801 --> 00:03:02.601
All right.

23
00:03:06.545 --> 00:03:07.813
How's she coming?

24
00:03:07.816 --> 00:03:09.051
Take it easy.

25
00:03:09.054 --> 00:03:09.707
Ow!

26
00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:12.004
You got my finger!

27
00:03:12.007 --> 00:03:14.242
Why don't you get your finger out of the way?

28
00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:15.757
There you are.

29
00:03:15.835 --> 00:03:17.483
Right on my finger!

30
00:03:17.486 --> 00:03:19.041
It's a lucky thing it wasn't your head.

31
00:03:19.106 --> 00:03:21.342
Zeke, what am I going to do about Miss Gulch?

32
00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:23.337
Just because Toto chases her old cat.

33
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.342
Listen, honey, I got them hogs to get in.

34
00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.258
Now lookit, Dorothy, you ain't
using your head about Miss Gulch.

35
00:03:28.261 --> 00:03:30.015
Think you didn't have any brains at all.

36
00:03:30.018 --> 00:03:31.549
I have so got brains!

37
00:03:31.552 --> 00:03:32.920
Well why don't you use them?

38
00:03:33.068 --> 00:03:35.189
When you come home, don't
go by Miss Gulch's place.

39
00:03:35.248 --> 00:03:39.252
Then Toto won't get in her garden, and
you won't get in no trouble. See?

40
00:03:39.347 --> 00:03:42.296
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.

41
00:03:42.363 --> 00:03:44.763
Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know.

42
00:03:44.875 --> 00:03:45.441
Ow!

43
00:03:46.957 --> 00:03:48.191
Sooey!

44
00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:51.372
Get in there before I make a dime bank out of ya!

45
00:03:54.208 --> 00:03:55.576
Listen, kid.

46
00:03:56.911 --> 00:04:00.017
Are you going to let that old
Gulch heifer try and buffalo ya'?

47
00:04:00.681 --> 00:04:04.151
She ain't nothing to be afraid of.
Have a little courage, that's all.

48
00:04:04.218 --> 00:04:05.586
I'm not afraid of her.

49
00:04:05.653 --> 00:04:08.723
Then the next time she squawks, walk
right up to her and spit in her eye.

50
00:04:08.726 --> 00:04:10.036
That's what I'd do!

51
00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.633
Oh!

52
00:04:11.317 --> 00:04:12.153
Oh!

53
00:04:12.767 --> 00:04:13.572
Oh!

54
00:04:13.603 --> 00:04:14.244
Zeke!

55
00:04:14.274 --> 00:04:18.165
Zeke! Help me please! Get me out of here! Help!

56
00:04:19.234 --> 00:04:19.992
Oh!

57
00:04:20.681 --> 00:04:21.325
Oh!

58
00:04:21.328 --> 00:04:22.503
Are you all right, Dorothy?

59
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:23.914
Yes, I'm all right.

60
00:04:23.917 --> 00:04:24.618
Oh!

61
00:04:24.739 --> 00:04:26.574
I fell in and Zeke.

62
00:04:29.043 --> 00:04:31.979
Why, Zeke, you're just as scared as I am!

63
00:04:32.083 --> 00:04:32.954
What's the matter?

64
00:04:32.957 --> 00:04:35.549
You gonna let a little old pig
make a coward out of ya'?

65
00:04:35.616 --> 00:04:37.051
Look at you, Zeke your justa' bunch of...

66
00:04:37.118 --> 00:04:39.887
Here, here. What's all this jabber-wapping
when there's work to be done?

67
00:04:39.954 --> 00:04:43.089
I know three shiftless farm hands that'll
be out of a job before they know it!

68
00:04:43.135 --> 00:04:44.630
Well, Dorothy was walking along the...

69
00:04:44.633 --> 00:04:46.550
I saw you tinkering with
that contraption, Hickory.

70
00:04:46.553 --> 00:04:48.064
Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon!

71
00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:49.363
All right, Mrs. Gale.

72
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.366
But some day they're going to erect
a statue to me in this town, and...

73
00:04:52.433 --> 00:04:54.468
Well, don't start posing for it now.

74
00:04:54.835 --> 00:04:57.427
Here, here, can't work on an empty stomach.
Have some crullers.

75
00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.332
- Gosh, Mrs. Gale.
- Oh, thanks.

76
00:04:58.335 --> 00:04:59.493
- Just fried.
- Swell.

77
00:04:59.617 --> 00:05:02.096
You see, Dorothy toppled in with the big Duroc...

78
00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:04.178
It's no place for Dorothy about a pig sty!

79
00:05:04.245 --> 00:05:07.185
Now, you go feed those hogs before
they worry themselves into anemia!

80
00:05:07.188 --> 00:05:07.668
Yes'am.

81
00:05:07.715 --> 00:05:11.999
Auntie Em, really, you know what
Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto?

82
00:05:12.002 --> 00:05:12.550
She said she was gonna...

83
00:05:12.553 --> 00:05:14.889
Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things.

84
00:05:14.955 --> 00:05:17.294
You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.

85
00:05:17.297 --> 00:05:19.198
Now, you just help us out today

86
00:05:19.201 --> 00:05:21.675
and find yourself a place where
you won't get into any trouble.

87
00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:27.413
Some place where there isn't any trouble.

88
00:05:28.703 --> 00:05:31.205
Do you suppose there is such a place, Toto?

89
00:05:32.273 --> 00:05:33.541
There must be.

90
00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.493
It's not a place you can get
to by a boat or a train.

91
00:05:41.243 --> 00:05:43.722
It's far, far away.

92
00:05:44.752 --> 00:05:46.387
Behind the moon.

93
00:05:47.421 --> 00:05:48.923

Howdy, Miss Gulch.

115
00:08:20.941 --> 00:08:23.911
I want to see you and your
wife right away about Dorothy.

116
00:08:23.978 --> 00:08:25.546
Dorothy? Well, what has Dorothy done?

117
00:08:25.636 --> 00:08:28.839
What's she done? I'm all but
lame from the bite on my leg!

118
00:08:28.883 --> 00:08:30.194
You mean, she bit you?

119
00:08:30.197 --> 00:08:31.514
No, her dog!

120
00:08:31.765 --> 00:08:34.922
Oh, she bit her dog, eh?

121
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:36.757
No!

122
00:08:38.325 --> 00:08:39.852
That dog's a menace to the community.

123
00:08:39.855 --> 00:08:42.265
I'm taking him to the sheriff
and make sure he's destroyed.

124
00:08:42.329 --> 00:08:44.323
Destroyed? Toto?

125
00:08:44.699 --> 00:08:46.500
Oh, you can't! You mustn't!

126
00:08:46.778 --> 00:08:48.044
Auntie Em!

127
00:08:48.106 --> 00:08:50.471
Uncle Henry! You won't let her, will you?

128
00:08:50.571 --> 00:08:53.107
Of course, we won't. Ah, will we, Em?

129
00:08:53.641 --> 00:08:56.266
Please, Aunt Em! Toto didn't mean to.

130
00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:59.346
He didn't know he was doing anything wrong.
I'm the one that ought to be punished.

131
00:08:59.413 --> 00:09:02.722
I let him go in her garden. You can
send me to bed without supper.

132
00:09:02.725 --> 00:09:05.720
If you don't hand over that dog, I'll bring
a damage suit that'll take your whole farm!

133
00:09:05.786 --> 00:09:08.189
There's a law protecting
folks against dogs that bite!

134
00:09:08.255 --> 00:09:09.890
How would it be if she keeps him tied up?

135
00:09:09.957 --> 00:09:12.193
He's really gentle, with gentle people, that is.

136
00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:14.779
Well, that's for the sheriff to decide.

137
00:09:14.892 --> 00:09:16.819
Here's his order allowing me to take him.

138
00:09:16.931 --> 00:09:18.952
Unless you want to go against the law.

139
00:09:19.854 --> 00:09:21.089
Uhh...

140
00:09:21.877 --> 00:09:23.188
Yeah.

141
00:09:23.204 --> 00:09:26.707
Now, we can't go against the law, Dorothy.
I'm afraid poor Toto will have to go.

142
00:09:26.774 --> 00:09:28.275
Now you're seeing reason.

143
00:09:28.342 --> 00:09:31.579
Here's what I'm taking him in,
so he can't attack me again.

144
00:09:31.645 --> 00:09:33.781
Oh, no, no! I won't let you take him!

145
00:09:33.848 --> 00:09:36.083
You go away, you...! Oooh, I'll bite you myself!

146
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:37.251
Dorothy!

147
00:09:37.485 --> 00:09:38.953
You wicked old witch!

148
00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:41.455
Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, don't let 'em take Toto!

149
00:09:41.522 --> 00:09:44.158
- Don't let her take him, please! Stop her!
- Here! I've got an order! Let me have...

150
00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:47.127
- Put him in the basket, Henry.
- The idea!

151
00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:48.865
Don't, Uncle Henry.

152
00:09:50.831 --> 00:09:51.932
Oh, Toto!

153
00:09:54.878 --> 00:09:55.698
Toto!

154
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:05.713
Almira Gulch, just because
you own half the county

155
00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:08.582
doesn't mean you have the
power to run the rest of us!

156
00:10:08.649 --> 00:10:11.886
For 23 years I've been dying to
tell you what I thought of you!

157
00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:12.993
And now...

158
00:10:13.354 --> 00:10:16.242
Well, being a christian woman, I can't say it!

159
00:10:41.882 --> 00:10:45.419
Toto, darling! Oh, I've got you back!

160
00:10:45.686 --> 00:10:47.088
You came back!

161
00:10:47.779 --> 00:10:49.724
Oh, I'm so glad!

162
00:10:50.126 --> 00:10:51.102
Toto!

163
00:10:53.098 --> 00:10:56.664
Oh, they'll be coming back for you in a minute.

164
00:10:57.932 --> 00:11:01.001
We've got to get away! We've got to run away!

165
00:11:36.971 --> 00:11:40.007
Well, well, well! Houseguests, huh?

166
00:11:40.274 --> 00:11:42.009
And who might you be?

167
00:11:42.476 --> 00:11:44.245
No, no, now don't tell me.

168
00:11:45.112 --> 00:11:46.947
Let's see. You're...

169
00:11:47.348 --> 00:11:50.317
You're traveling in disguise.
No, that's not right.

170
00:11:50.408 --> 00:11:51.983
I, you're.

171
00:11:51.986 --> 00:11:54.689
You're going on a visit. No, I'm wrong.

172
00:11:54.756 --> 00:11:56.756
That's... you're...

173
00:11:56.857 --> 00:11:58.426
You're running away.

174
00:11:58.492 --> 00:11:59.860
How did you guess?

175
00:12:00.261 --> 00:12:02.930
Professor Marvel never guesses. He knows!

176
00:12:02.997 --> 00:12:04.865
Now why are you running away?

177
00:12:04.932 --> 00:12:06.855
No, no, now don't tell me.

178
00:12:07.129 --> 00:12:10.604
They, they don't understand you at home.
They don't appreciate you.

179
00:12:10.671 --> 00:12:14.809
You want to see other lands, big
cities, big mountains, big oceans.

180
00:12:15.076 --> 00:12:17.712
Why, it's just like you could
read what was inside of me.

181
00:12:17.836 --> 00:12:18.789
Yes,

182
00:12:19.013 --> 00:12:22.149
Toto, that's not polite!
We haven't been asked yet.

183
00:12:22.717 --> 00:12:24.618
He's perfectly welcome.

184
00:12:25.286 --> 00:12:27.388
As one dog to another, huh?

185
00:12:28.489 --> 00:12:30.257
Now, let's see. Where were we?

186
00:12:30.579 --> 00:12:32.666
Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you

187
00:12:32.669 --> 00:12:34.537
and see all the crowned heads of Europe?

188
00:12:34.595 --> 00:12:36.864
Do you know any? You mean, the... thing.

189
00:12:37.072 --> 00:12:39.199
Yes eh, well eh, I eh...

190
00:12:39.215 --> 00:12:42.203
I never do anything without
consulting my crystal first.

191
00:12:42.503 --> 00:12:46.440
Let's eh, go inside here, we'll eh,
just come along. I'll show you.

192
00:12:46.874 --> 00:12:51.054
That's right. Here, sit right down here.
That's it.

193
00:12:51.779 --> 00:12:56.822
This, this is the same genuine,
magic, authentic crystal

194
00:12:56.951 --> 00:13:01.455
used by the priests of Isis and Osiris
in the days of the pharaohs of Egypt,

195
00:13:01.856 --> 00:13:07.062
in which Cleopatra first saw the approach
of Julius Caesar and Marc Anthony, and eh,

196
00:13:07.128 --> 00:13:08.929
and so on and so on.

197
00:13:09.034 --> 00:13:13.214
Now eh, you eh, you'd better close
your eyes, my child,

198
00:13:13.217 --> 00:13:17.995
for a moment, in order to be
better in tune with the infinite.

199
00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:22.125
We eh, we can't do these things without

200
00:13:22.376 --> 00:13:24.545
reaching out into the infinite.

201
00:13:24.739 --> 00:13:30.136
Yes. That's, that's all right. Now you
can open them. We'll gaze into the crystal.

202
00:13:30.552 --> 00:13:31.958
Ahh.

203
00:13:32.153 --> 00:13:33.754
What's this I see?

204
00:13:33.888 --> 00:13:35.923
A house with a picket fence

205
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:38.059
and a barn with a weather vane and a...

206
00:13:38.485 --> 00:13:41.195
Of a, of a running horse.

207
00:13:41.662 --> 00:13:43.197
That's our farm!

208
00:13:43.296 --> 00:13:46.587
Yes, yes, there's, there's a woman, she's...

209
00:13:46.901 --> 00:13:49.236
She's wearing a polka-dot dress.

210
00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:51.605
Her face is careworn.

211
00:13:51.839 --> 00:13:53.307
That's Aunt Em.

212
00:13:53.374 --> 00:13:55.540
Yes. Her eh, her name is Emily.

213
00:13:55.713 --> 00:13:57.948
That's right. What's she doing?

214
00:13:58.122 --> 00:14:00.291
Well, I, I can't quite see.

215
00:14:00.858 --> 00:14:02.326
Why, she's crying!

216
00:14:02.527 --> 00:14:06.564
Someone has hurt her. Someone has
just about broken her heart.

217
00:14:07.398 --> 00:14:08.266
Me?

218
00:14:08.699 --> 00:14:11.636
Well, it's eh, someone she loves very much.

219
00:14:11.702 --> 00:14:15.907
Someone she's been very kind to, someone
she's taken care of in sickness.

220
00:14:16.707 --> 00:14:20.607
I had the measles once and she
stayed right by me every minute.

221
00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:21.405
Uh-huh.

222
00:14:22.304 --> 00:14:23.806
What's she doing now?

223
00:14:23.809 --> 00:14:25.119
Well, she's eh...

224
00:14:25.449 --> 00:14:26.616
What's this?

225
00:14:26.691 --> 00:14:29.494
Why, she's, she's putting her hand on her heart,

226
00:14:29.921 --> 00:14:32.190
she's, she's dropping down on the bed!

227
00:14:32.423 --> 00:14:33.324
Oh, no, no!

228
00:14:33.391 --> 00:14:36.260
Well, that's all, the crystal's gone dark.

229
00:14:36.594 --> 00:14:39.711
Oh, you, you don't suppose she
could really be sick, do you?

230
00:14:39.714 --> 00:14:41.866
Oh, oh, I've got to go home right away!

231
00:14:41.933 --> 00:14:44.202
But, what's this? I thought
you were going along with me.

232
00:14:44.268 --> 00:14:47.405
Oh, no, no, I have to get to
her right away! Come on, Toto!

233
00:14:47.472 --> 00:14:48.840
Come on! Come on!

234
00:14:50.842 --> 00:14:53.878
Goodbye, Professor Marvel, and thanks a lot!

235
00:14:56.247 --> 00:15:00.184
Better get under cover, Sylvester,
there's a storm blowing up, a whopper,

236
00:15:00.518 --> 00:15:02.987
to speak in the vernacular of the peasantry.

237
00:15:03.054 --> 00:15:05.883
Poor little kid. I hope she gets home all right.

238
00:15:14.932 --> 00:15:17.812
Hunk, get them horses loose! Where's Hickory.

239
00:15:17.859 --> 00:15:21.841
Hickory! Hickory! Doggone it Hick!

240
00:15:23.374 --> 00:15:25.773
It's a twister! It's a twister!

241
00:15:33.109 --> 00:15:34.210
Dorothy!

242
00:15:39.657 --> 00:15:41.034
Dorothy!

243
00:15:51.769 --> 00:15:54.105
Come on, everybody in the storm cellar!

244
00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:06.451
Henry! Henry! I can't find Dorothy!
She's somewhere out in the storm!

245
00:16:06.551 --> 00:16:07.578
Dorothy!

246
00:16:07.581 --> 00:16:08.743
We can't look for her now!

247
00:16:08.745 --> 00:16:09.515
Dorothy!

248
00:16:09.518 --> 00:16:10.572
Come on get in the cellar. Hurry up!

249
00:16:36.147 --> 00:16:37.381
Auntie Em!

250
00:16:38.516 --> 00:16:39.684
Auntie Em!

251
00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:43.387
Auntie Em!

252
00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:54.699
Auntie Em! Uncle Henry!

253
00:17:04.709 --> 00:17:05.910
Auntie Em!

254
00:17:06.048 --> 00:17:06.861
Oh!

255
00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:38.256
Cluck-cluck-cluck-cluck.

256
00:17:39.431 --> 00:17:40.306
Cluck-cluck-cluck.

257
00:17:40.309 --> 00:17:42.858
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

258
00:17:55.658 --> 00:17:56.877
Moo.

259
00:17:58.451 --> 00:17:59.076
Ruff! Ruff!

260
00:17:59.477 --> 00:18:00.821
Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!

261
00:18:14.145 --> 00:18:16.614
We must be up inside the cyclone!

262
00:18:19.911 --> 00:18:21.986
Oh! Miss Gulch!

263
00:18:45.379 --> 00:18:46.231
Aaaahh!

264
00:18:46.426 --> 00:18:47.121
Aahh!

265
00:18:47.793 --> 00:18:48.590
Aaaahh!

266
00:18:49.046 --> 00:18:49.702
Ahh!

267
00:19:00.887 --> 00:19:01.687
Oh!

268
00:20:49.801 --> 00:20:54.118
Toto, I've a feeling we're
not in Kansas anymore..

269
00:21:04.882 --> 00:21:07.018
We must be over the rainbow!

270
00:21:37.248 --> 00:21:39.717
Now I, I know we're not in Kansas.

271
00:21:42.587 --> 00:21:45.289
Are you a good witch or a bad witch?

272
00:21:47.058 --> 00:21:48.059
Who, me?

273
00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:52.563
I'm not a witch at all. I'm
Dorothy Gale from Kansas.

274
00:21:52.896 --> 00:21:53.701
Oh!

275
00:21:53.898 --> 00:21:55.566
Well, is that the witch?

276
00:21:55.833 --> 00:21:56.701
Who, Toto?

277
00:21:56.768 --> 00:21:58.202
Toto's my dog.

278
00:21:58.536 --> 00:22:00.171
Well, I'm a little muddled.

279
00:22:00.238 --> 00:22:03.741
The Munchkins called me because a new
witch has just dropped a house

280
00:22:03.808 --> 00:22:08.045
on The Wicked Witch of the East. And
there's the house, and here you are

281
00:22:08.112 --> 00:22:11.549
and that's all that's left
of the Wicked Witch of the East.

282
00:22:12.417 --> 00:22:14.352
And so what the Munchkins want to know is,

283
00:22:14.419 --> 00:22:16.754
are you a good witch or a bad witch?

284
00:22:17.522 --> 00:22:20.291
But, I've already told you,
I'm not a witch at all,

285
00:22:20.358 --> 00:22:22.093
witches are old and ugly.

286
00:22:24.855 --> 00:22:25.763
What was that?

287
00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:29.434
The Munchkins. They're
laughing because I am a witch.

288
00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:32.036
I'm Glinda, the Witch of the North.

289
00:22:32.103 --> 00:22:33.271
You are?

290
00:22:34.205 --> 00:22:35.740
Oh, I beg your pardon!

291
00:22:35.807 --> 00:22:38.810
But I've never heard of a beautiful witch before.

292
00:22:39.243 --> 00:22:41.245
Only bad witches are ugly.

293
00:22:41.813 --> 00:22:43.199
The Munchkins are happy because

294
00:22:43.202 --> 00:22:45.703
you have freed them from the
Wicked Witch of the East.

295
00:22:45.706 --> 00:22:48.743
Oh, but if you please, what are Munchkins?

296
00:22:49.487 --> 00:22:52.490
The little people who live in this land.
It's Munchkinland

297
00:22:52.557 --> 00:22:55.159
and you are their national heroine, my dear.

298
00:22:55.226 --> 00:22:58.391

Ahh!

391
00:29:22.626 --> 00:29:24.493
I thought you said she was dead.

392
00:29:24.779 --> 00:29:27.282
That was her sister,
the Wicked Witch of the East.

393
00:29:27.349 --> 00:29:30.985
This is The Wicked Witch of the West.
She's worse than the other one was.

394
00:29:31.052 --> 00:29:34.923
Who killed my sister? Who
killed The Witch of the East?

395
00:29:35.208 --> 00:29:36.509
Was it you?

396
00:29:36.627 --> 00:29:40.733
No, no. It was an accident. I
didn't mean to kill anybody.

397
00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:44.146
Well, my little pretty, I
can cause accidents, too!

398
00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:46.112
Aren't you forgetting The Ruby Slippers?

399
00:29:46.178 --> 00:29:48.107
The Slippers, yes!

400
00:29:48.901 --> 00:29:50.303
The Slippers!

401
00:29:57.957 --> 00:29:59.024
They're gone!

402
00:29:59.091 --> 00:30:01.460
The Ruby Slippers! What have you done with them?

403
00:30:01.527 --> 00:30:03.505
Give them back to me or I'll...

404
00:30:03.536 --> 00:30:05.297
It's too late! There they are

405
00:30:05.364 --> 00:30:07.066
and there they'll stay!

406
00:30:11.036 --> 00:30:12.738
Give me back my slippers!

407
00:30:12.805 --> 00:30:14.673
I'm the only one who knows how to use them.

408
00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:17.276
They're of no use to you. Give them back to me.

409
00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:18.515
Give them back!

410
00:30:18.632 --> 00:30:19.814
Keep tight inside of them.

411
00:30:19.879 --> 00:30:23.249
Their magic must be very powerful,
or she wouldn't want them so badly.

412
00:30:23.315 --> 00:30:26.352
You stay out of this, Glenda,
or I'll fix you as well!

413
00:30:26.519 --> 00:30:28.587
Rubbish! You have no power here.

414
00:30:28.654 --> 00:30:31.724
Begone, before somebody
drops a house on you, too!

415
00:30:31.857 --> 00:30:34.885
Very well, I'll bide my time.

416
00:30:35.094 --> 00:30:37.196
And as for you, my fine lady,

417
00:30:37.296 --> 00:30:40.199
it's true I can't attend to
you here and now as I'd like

418
00:30:40.266 --> 00:30:42.535
but just try to stay out of my way.

419
00:30:42.601 --> 00:30:43.736
Just try!

420
00:30:44.103 --> 00:30:47.473
I'll get you, my pretty,
and your little dog, too!

421
00:30:59.218 --> 00:31:01.821
It's all right. You can get up. She's gone.

422
00:31:02.321 --> 00:31:04.957
It's all right. You can all get up.

423
00:31:06.258 --> 00:31:08.027
What a smell of sulphur!

424
00:31:08.094 --> 00:31:11.297
I'm afraid you've made rather a bad
enemy of The Wicked Witch of the West.

425
00:31:11.363 --> 00:31:15.668
The sooner you get out of Oz altogether,
the safer you'll sleep, my dear.

426
00:31:15.768 --> 00:31:18.871
I'd give anything to get
out of Oz altogether, but

427
00:31:19.105 --> 00:31:23.142
which is the way back to Kansas?
I can't go the way I came.

428
00:31:23.275 --> 00:31:26.245
No, that's true. The only person who might know

429
00:31:26.479 --> 00:31:29.782
would be the great and wonderful
Wizard of Oz himself!

430
00:31:30.216 --> 00:31:33.285
The Wizard of Oz? Is he good or is he wicked?

431
00:31:33.663 --> 00:31:37.456
Oh, very good, but very mysterious.
He lives in The Emerald City,

432
00:31:37.523 --> 00:31:41.794
and that's a long journey from here. Did
you bring your broomstick with you?

433
00:31:42.261 --> 00:31:43.963
No, I'm afraid I didn't.

434
00:31:44.029 --> 00:31:45.865
Well, then, you'll have to walk.

435
00:31:45.931 --> 00:31:49.468
The Munchkins will see you safely
to the border of Munchkinland.

436
00:31:49.568 --> 00:31:54.006
And remember, never let those Ruby
Slippers off your feet for a moment

437
00:31:54.206 --> 00:31:57.448
or you will be at the mercy of
The Wicked Witch of the West.

438
00:31:58.444 --> 00:32:01.280
But, how do I start for Emerald City?

439
00:32:01.347 --> 00:32:03.616
It's always best to start at the beginning

440
00:32:03.682 --> 00:32:06.942
and all you do is follow The Yellow Brick Road.

441
00:32:17.029 --> 00:32:18.631
But, what happens if I...

442
00:32:18.697 --> 00:32:21.233
Just follow The Yellow Brick Road.

443
00:32:22.334 --> 00:32:24.003
Goodbye. Goodbye.

444
00:32:24.006 --> 00:32:24.831

480
00:34:05.037 --> 00:34:06.372
Now which way do we go?

481
00:34:06.438 --> 00:34:09.307
Pardon me. That way is a very nice way.

482
00:34:12.812 --> 00:34:14.141
Who said that?

483
00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:15.725
Arf! Arf-Arf! Ruff!

484
00:34:15.903 --> 00:34:17.270
Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf!

485
00:34:17.508 --> 00:34:17.989
Arf!

486
00:34:17.992 --> 00:34:21.045
Don't be silly, Toto. Scarecrows don't talk.

487
00:34:21.069 --> 00:34:23.289
It's pleasant down that way, too.

488
00:34:24.890 --> 00:34:26.158
That's funny.

489
00:34:27.126 --> 00:34:28.769
Wasn't he pointing the other way?

490
00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.330
Of course, people do go both ways.

491
00:34:35.011 --> 00:34:38.037
Why, you did say something, didn't you?

492
00:34:43.142 --> 00:34:46.312
Are you doing that on purpose,
or can't you make up your mind?

493
00:34:46.378 --> 00:34:49.415
That's the trouble. I can't make up my mind.

494
00:34:49.682 --> 00:34:51.567
I haven't got a brain,

495
00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:53.054
only straw.

496
00:34:53.619 --> 00:34:56.188
How can you talk if you haven't got a brain?

497
00:34:56.589 --> 00:34:57.957
I don't know.

498
00:34:58.457 --> 00:35:02.128
But some people without brains do an
awful lot of talking, don't they?

499
00:35:02.194 --> 00:35:04.230
Yes, I guess you're right.

500
00:35:05.522 --> 00:35:09.321
Well, we haven't really met properly, have we?

501
00:35:10.069 --> 00:35:11.203
Why, no.

502
00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:14.039
How do you do?

503
00:35:14.106 --> 00:35:15.341
Very well, thank you.

504
00:35:15.408 --> 00:35:17.276
Oh, I'm not feeling at all well.

505
00:35:17.826 --> 00:35:20.367
You see, it's very tedious being stuck up here

506
00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:22.948
all day long with a pole up your back.

507
00:35:22.987 --> 00:35:26.886
Oh, dear, that must be terribly
uncomfortable. Can't you get down?

508
00:35:26.941 --> 00:35:29.822
Down? No, you see, I'm, well, I'm...

509
00:35:29.955 --> 00:35:32.124
Oh, well, here, let me help you.

510
00:35:32.258 --> 00:35:35.230
Oh, that's very kind of you, very kind.

511
00:35:35.271 --> 00:35:39.010
Well, oh, dear, I don't quite see how I can,

512
00:35:39.064 --> 00:35:41.934
Of course, I'm not bright about doing things

513
00:35:42.468 --> 00:35:44.601
but if you'll just bend the nail down

514
00:35:44.604 --> 00:35:47.128
in the back, maybe I'll slip off and come...

515
00:35:47.131 --> 00:35:48.311
Oh, yes.

516
00:35:48.314 --> 00:35:49.959
Ohhhh, woops.

517
00:35:50.843 --> 00:35:52.220
There goes some of me again!

518
00:35:52.223 --> 00:35:53.711
Ohh! Does it hurt you?

519
00:35:53.751 --> 00:35:57.817
Oh, no. I just keep picking it
up and putting it back in again.

520
00:35:58.117 --> 00:35:59.706
My! It's good to be free!

521
00:35:59.709 --> 00:36:02.156
Oh! Oh! Ohhh!

522
00:36:02.421 --> 00:36:03.789
Did I scare you?

523
00:36:03.889 --> 00:36:06.926
No, no, I, I just thought you hurt yourself.

524
00:36:07.059 --> 00:36:08.627
But I didn't scare ya'?

525
00:36:08.828 --> 00:36:10.229
No, of course not.

526
00:36:10.555 --> 00:36:11.756
I didn't think so.

527
00:36:11.767 --> 00:36:12.327
Caw

528
00:36:12.758 --> 00:36:13.281
caw.

529
00:36:13.285 --> 00:36:13.703
Boo!

530
00:36:13.705 --> 00:36:14.158
Caw.

531
00:36:14.161 --> 00:36:14.572
Scat!

532
00:36:14.575 --> 00:36:15.154
Boo!

533
00:36:17.628 --> 00:36:18.128
Caw.

534
00:36:18.457 --> 00:36:21.207
You see, I can't even scare a crow.

535
00:36:21.707 --> 00:36:25.845
They come from miles around just to
eat in my field and-and laugh in my face.

536
00:36:25.911 --> 00:36:29.502
Oh, I'm a failure, because I haven't got a brain.

537
00:36:29.658 --> 00:36:32.885
Well, what would you do
with a brain if you had one?

538
00:36:32.952 --> 00:36:35.755

Wonderful!

562
00:37:40.152 --> 00:37:44.790
Why, if our scarecrow back in Kansas could
do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!

563
00:37:44.857 --> 00:37:46.292
- They would?
- Um-hmm..

564
00:37:46.425 --> 00:37:47.493
Where's Kansas?

565
00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:48.894
That's where I live.

566
00:37:48.961 --> 00:37:52.098
And I want to get back there so badly
I'm going all the way to Emerald City

567
00:37:52.164 --> 00:37:54.233
to get The Wizard of Oz to help me.

568
00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:56.535
- You're going to see a Wizard?
- Um-hmm.

569
00:37:57.269 --> 00:38:00.639
Do you think if I went with you this
Wizard would give me some brains?

570
00:38:00.706 --> 00:38:02.174
I couldn't say.

571
00:38:02.742 --> 00:38:06.278
But even if he didn't, you'd be
no worse off than you are now.

572
00:38:06.879 --> 00:38:08.247
Yes, that's true.

573
00:38:08.314 --> 00:38:10.921
But maybe you'd better not.
I've got a witch mad at me,

574
00:38:10.924 --> 00:38:12.118
and you might get into trouble.

575
00:38:12.184 --> 00:38:13.013
Witch?

576
00:38:13.016 --> 00:38:16.522
Huh! I'm not afraid of a witch!
I'm not afraid of anything!

577
00:38:18.791 --> 00:38:20.659
Except a lighted match.

578
00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:22.228
I don't blame you for that.

579
00:38:22.294 --> 00:38:26.025
But I'd face a whole box full of them
for the chance of getting some brains.

580
00:38:26.325 --> 00:38:27.794
Look,

581
00:38:28.367 --> 00:38:31.103
I won't be any trouble
because I don't eat a thing.

582
00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:34.473
I won't try to manage things
because I can't think.

583
00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:36.975
Won't you take me with you?

584
00:38:37.643 --> 00:38:39.011
Why, of course I will!

585
00:38:39.879 --> 00:38:42.181
Hooray! We're off to see a Wizard!

586
00:38:42.264 --> 00:38:44.650
Oh, well, you're not starting out very well.

587
00:38:44.717 --> 00:38:47.019
Oh, I'll try! Really, I will.

588
00:38:47.774 --> 00:38:49.229

Apples!

00:39:29.839 --> 00:39:31.721
Oh, look!

602
00:39:34.105 --> 00:39:34.868
Oh!

603
00:39:38.689 --> 00:39:39.614
Ouch!

604
00:39:39.916 --> 00:39:41.693
What do you think you're doing?

605
00:39:43.886 --> 00:39:46.923
We've been walking a long
ways and I was hungry and...

606
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:49.492
Did you say something?

607
00:39:49.559 --> 00:39:51.661
- She was hungry!
- She was hungry!

608
00:39:51.728 --> 00:39:55.832
Well, how would you like to have someone
come along and pick something off of you?

609
00:39:56.065 --> 00:39:59.785
Oh, dear! I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas.

610
00:40:00.503 --> 00:40:04.344
Come along, Dorothy, you don't
want any of those apples. Hmm!

611
00:40:04.363 --> 00:40:06.613
Are you hinting my apples
aren't what they ought to be?

612
00:40:06.766 --> 00:40:10.658
Oh, no! It's just that she doesn't
like little green worms!

613
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:11.668
Oh you...!

614
00:40:11.671 --> 00:40:12.643
Ahhh!

615
00:40:15.351 --> 00:40:16.476
You can't do that to me!

616
00:40:16.776 --> 00:40:18.945
I'll show you how to get apples.

617
00:40:21.157 --> 00:40:21.757
Oh.

618
00:40:25.518 --> 00:40:28.654
Hooray! I guess that did it! Help yourself.

619
00:40:53.737 --> 00:40:55.347
Why, it's a man!

620
00:40:56.924 --> 00:40:59.051
A man made out of tin!

621
00:40:59.347 --> 00:41:00.789
- What?
- Yes.

622
00:41:01.929 --> 00:41:02.660
Oh!

623
00:41:03.022 --> 00:41:03.805
Look!

624
00:41:03.883 --> 00:41:04.896
Oil can!

625
00:41:05.825 --> 00:41:07.059
Oil can!

626
00:41:08.261 --> 00:41:10.096
Did you say something?

627
00:41:10.163 --> 00:41:11.297
Oil can!

628
00:41:12.465 --> 00:41:14.000
He said, "Oil can."

629
00:41:14.233 --> 00:41:15.635
Oil can what?

630
00:41:15.868 --> 00:41:16.869
Oil can?

631
00:41:18.668 --> 00:41:19.320
Oh, here it is!

632
00:41:19.323 --> 00:41:20.188
Oh, here it is! Help!

633
00:41:20.191 --> 00:41:21.196
Oh, here it is!

634
00:41:22.137 --> 00:41:23.660
Where do you want to be oiled first?

635
00:41:23.663 --> 00:41:25.801
My mouth! My mouth!

636
00:41:25.804 --> 00:41:27.146
He said his mouth.

637
00:41:31.284 --> 00:41:32.785
The other side...

638
00:41:40.628 --> 00:41:43.484
Mm... Mm... My... my,

639
00:41:43.488 --> 00:41:45.623
my goodness, I can talk again!

640
00:41:45.757 --> 00:41:49.101
Oh, oil my arms, please, oil my elbows.

641
00:41:50.374 --> 00:41:51.375
Here.

642
00:41:52.459 --> 00:41:53.389
Oh...

643
00:41:54.634 --> 00:41:56.509
Oh, did that hurt?

644
00:41:56.583 --> 00:42:01.293
No, it feels wonderful.
I've held that axe up for ages.

645
00:42:01.541 --> 00:42:02.682
Oh, goodness!

646
00:42:02.949 --> 00:42:05.151
How did you ever get like his?

647
00:42:05.154 --> 00:42:06.932
Oh, well...

648
00:42:07.587 --> 00:42:10.690
about a year ago, I was chopping that tree,

649
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:13.025
when suddenly it began to rain

650
00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:16.891
and right in the middle of
a chop, I... I rusted solid.

651
00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:19.565
I've been that way ever since.

652
00:42:22.635 --> 00:42:24.670
Well, you're perfect now.

653
00:42:24.871 --> 00:42:26.472
My neck. My... My neck.

654
00:42:27.006 --> 00:42:28.074
Perfect?

655
00:42:28.541 --> 00:42:31.110
Bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect.

656
00:42:31.544 --> 00:42:33.179
Go ahead, bang on it.

657
00:42:35.815 --> 00:42:37.850
Beautiful! What an echo!

658
00:42:38.684 --> 00:42:39.986
It's empty.

659
00:42:41.187 --> 00:42:43.756
The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.

660
00:42:44.791 --> 00:42:45.958
No heart?

661
00:42:46.859 --> 00:42:47.860
No heart.

662
00:42:48.795 --> 00:42:50.791

Well, suppose The Wizard wouldn't
get me one when we got there?

696
00:45:49.976 --> 00:45:51.543
Oh, but he will!

697
00:45:51.592 --> 00:45:52.678
He must!

698
00:45:53.279 --> 00:45:55.781
We've come such a long way already.

699
00:46:01.888 --> 00:46:03.556
You call that long?

700
00:46:03.623 --> 00:46:05.525
Why, you've just begun!

701
00:46:05.792 --> 00:46:09.662
Helping the little lady along,
are you, my fine gentlemen?

702
00:46:09.796 --> 00:46:11.831
Well, stay away from her

703
00:46:12.031 --> 00:46:14.133
or I'll stuff a mattress with you!

704
00:46:15.535 --> 00:46:16.669
And you!

705
00:46:16.869 --> 00:46:19.338
I'll use you for a beehive!

706
00:46:19.572 --> 00:46:22.208
Here, Scarecrow! Want to play ball?

707
00:46:25.868 --> 00:46:27.537
Help, help! Fire!

708
00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:29.582
I'm burning! I'm burning!

709
00:46:42.395 --> 00:46:43.637
I'm not afraid of her.

710
00:46:44.007 --> 00:46:46.067
I'll see you get safely to The Wizard now

711
00:46:46.132 --> 00:46:47.542
whether I get a brain or not!

712
00:46:47.739 --> 00:46:50.238
"Stuff a mattress with me," hah!

713
00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:54.474
I'll see you reach The Wizard,
whether I get a heart or not.

714
00:46:54.536 --> 00:46:56.041
"Beehive," bah!

715
00:46:56.435 --> 00:46:58.580
Let her try and make a beehive out of me!

716
00:47:00.941 --> 00:47:01.875
Oh...

717
00:47:02.081 --> 00:47:04.784
You're the best friends anybody ever had.

718
00:47:05.218 --> 00:47:09.088
And it's funny, but I feel as
if I've known you all the time.

719
00:47:09.755 --> 00:47:11.491
But I couldn't have, could I?

720
00:47:11.557 --> 00:47:12.812
I don't see how.

721
00:47:13.007 --> 00:47:16.596
You weren't around when I was stuffed
and sewn together. Were you?

722
00:47:16.662 --> 00:47:20.333
And I was standing over there
rusting for the longest time.

723
00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:25.483
Still, I wish I could remember. But
I guess it doesn't matter anyway.

724
00:47:26.105 --> 00:47:28.007
We know each other now, don't we?

725
00:47:28.074 --> 00:47:30.109
- That's right.
- We do.

726
00:47:30.371 --> 00:47:31.736
- To Oz?
- To Oz!

Oh, look!

763
00:49:07.126 --> 00:49:07.704
Ralf.

764
00:49:07.734 --> 00:49:08.552
Rrralf.

765
00:49:09.653 --> 00:49:10.559
Grrr.

766
00:49:10.562 --> 00:49:11.133
Ralf.

767
00:49:12.030 --> 00:49:12.952
Rrralf.

768
00:49:13.521 --> 00:49:15.044
Rrralf.

769
00:49:15.505 --> 00:49:17.876
Rrralf.

770
00:49:19.319 --> 00:49:20.413
Rrralf.

771
00:49:21.051 --> 00:49:21.559
Ralf.

772
00:49:22.881 --> 00:49:23.428
Ralf.

773
00:49:24.766 --> 00:49:25.321
Huh.

774
00:49:27.295 --> 00:49:29.297
Put 'em up! Put 'em up!

775
00:49:30.732 --> 00:49:32.334
Which one of you first?

776
00:49:32.634 --> 00:49:35.103
I'll fight you both together, if you want.

777
00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:38.173
I'll fight you with one paw tied behind my back!

778
00:49:38.774 --> 00:49:40.675
I'll fight you standing on one foot!

779
00:49:40.742 --> 00:49:42.878
I'll fight you with my eyes closed.

780
00:49:43.481 --> 00:49:44.661
Oh...

781
00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:46.715
Pulling an axe on me, eh?

782
00:49:47.682 --> 00:49:49.221
Sneaking up on me, eh?

783
00:49:49.224 --> 00:49:50.315
Why...

784
00:49:50.954 --> 00:49:51.399
Ruff!

785
00:49:52.110 --> 00:49:52.718
Ruff!

786
00:49:52.721 --> 00:49:54.742
Here, here. Go 'way and let us alone!

787
00:49:54.745 --> 00:49:55.978
Oh, scared, huh?

788
00:49:56.057 --> 00:49:57.392
Afraid, huh?

789
00:49:58.026 --> 00:50:00.695
How long can you stay fresh in that can?

790
00:50:01.596 --> 00:50:05.558
Come on, get up and fight,
you shivering junkyard! Hiss.

791
00:50:06.535 --> 00:50:09.171
Put your hands up, you lopsided bag of hay!

792
00:50:09.237 --> 00:50:11.206
Now that's getting personal, Lion.

793
00:50:11.973 --> 00:50:14.142
Yes, get up and teach him a lesson.

794
00:50:14.209 --> 00:50:16.778
Well, what's wrong with you teaching him?

795
00:50:16.912 --> 00:50:18.402
Well, well, well, I hardly know him.

796
00:50:18.405 --> 00:50:18.746
Well, well, well, I hardly know him. Arf!

797
00:50:18.749 --> 00:50:19.325
Well, well, well, I hardly know him. Arf! Arf!

798
00:50:19.608 --> 00:50:20.727
Arf! Arf! Arf!

799
00:50:20.730 --> 00:50:22.684
Well I'll get you anyway, pee-wee.

800
00:50:22.687 --> 00:50:24.317
Rrralf.

801
00:50:24.350 --> 00:50:25.022
No! Toto!

802
00:50:25.025 --> 00:50:25.744
Rrralf.

803
00:50:28.367 --> 00:50:29.047
Rrralf.

804
00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:32.250
Rrralf.

805
00:50:33.495 --> 00:50:34.500
Shame on you!

806
00:50:34.503 --> 00:50:36.953
What, what did you do that for?

807
00:50:37.135 --> 00:50:38.535
I didn't bite him.

808
00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:40.502
No, but you tried to.

809
00:50:40.702 --> 00:50:42.676
It's bad enough picking on a straw man,

810
00:50:42.679 --> 00:50:44.775
but when you go around picking
on poor little dogs...

811
00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:47.509
Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did ya'?

812
00:50:49.044 --> 00:50:50.745
Is my nose bleeding?

813
00:50:51.046 --> 00:50:52.514
Well, of course not.

814
00:50:54.850 --> 00:50:57.319
My goodness, what a fuss you're making!

815
00:50:57.452 --> 00:51:01.656
Well, naturally, when you go around picking
on things weaker than you are,

816
00:51:01.723 --> 00:51:03.892
why, you're nothing but a great big coward!

817
00:51:03.927 --> 00:51:06.129
You're right, I am a coward!

818
00:51:07.365 --> 00:51:09.334
I haven't any courage at all.

819
00:51:10.031 --> 00:51:11.867
I even scare myself.

820
00:51:13.535 --> 00:51:15.570
Look at the circles under my eyes.

821
00:51:15.637 --> 00:51:17.472
I haven't slept in weeks.

822
00:51:17.873 --> 00:51:19.941
Why don't you try counting sheep?

823
00:51:20.041 --> 00:51:23.111
That doesn't do any good. I'm afraid of them.

824
00:51:24.579 --> 00:51:25.914
Aw, that's too bad.

825
00:51:27.249 --> 00:51:29.818
Don't you think The Wizard could help him, too?

826
00:51:29.885 --> 00:51:31.353
I don't see why not.

827
00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:33.622
Why don't you come along with us?

828
00:51:33.688 --> 00:51:36.558
We're on our way to see The Wizard now.
To get him a heart.

829
00:51:36.625 --> 00:51:37.759
And him a brain.

830
00:51:37.826 --> 00:51:39.738
I'm sure he could give you some courage.

831
00:51:39.741 --> 00:51:40.405
Well...

832
00:51:40.562 --> 00:51:45.000
Wouldn't you feel degraded to be
seen in the company of a cowardly lion?

833
00:51:45.526 --> 00:51:46.916
I would.

834
00:51:47.636 --> 00:51:49.304
No, of course not!

835
00:51:50.238 --> 00:51:52.941
Gee, that's, that's awfully nice of ya'.

836
00:51:53.865 --> 00:51:56.967
My life has been simply unbearable.

837
00:51:56.970 --> 00:51:57.754
Oh...

838
00:51:57.879 --> 00:52:01.750
Well, it's all right now. The
Wizard'll fix everything.

839
00:52:02.454 --> 00:52:04.686
It's, it's been in me so long.

840
00:52:05.454 --> 00:52:08.195
I just... gotta tell you how I feel.

841
00:52:08.387 --> 00:52:09.958

00:53:44.252 --> 00:53:47.088
something with poison in it, I think.

874
00:53:47.622 --> 00:53:49.323
With poison in it

875
00:53:49.924 --> 00:53:51.859
but attractive to the eye

876
00:53:51.926 --> 00:53:54.328
and soothing to the smell.

877
00:53:56.831 --> 00:53:57.832
Poppies.

878
00:53:58.993 --> 00:53:59.994
Poppies.

879
00:54:01.373 --> 00:54:03.641
Poppies will put them to sleep.

880
00:54:05.106 --> 00:54:06.240
Sleep.

881
00:54:07.275 --> 00:54:09.777
Now they'll sleep.

882
00:54:39.907 --> 00:54:41.542
There's Emerald City!

883
00:54:41.709 --> 00:54:44.445
Oh, we're almost there at last! At last!

884
00:54:45.346 --> 00:54:48.983
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Just like I knew it would be.

885
00:54:49.684 --> 00:54:52.987
He really must be a wonderful
wizard to live in a city like that!

886
00:54:53.054 --> 00:54:54.856
Well, come on, then. What are we waiting for?

887
00:54:54.922 --> 00:54:56.290
Nothing! Let's hurry!

888
00:54:56.357 --> 00:54:57.559
Yes, let's run!

889
00:54:57.562 --> 00:54:58.301
Yes.

890
00:55:02.563 --> 00:55:03.931
Come on, come on!

891
00:55:03.998 --> 00:55:05.266
Hurry! Hurry!

892
00:55:09.277 --> 00:55:10.338
Oh look!

893
00:55:11.066 --> 00:55:11.816
Come on!

894
00:55:12.473 --> 00:55:13.449
Come on!

895
00:55:13.452 --> 00:55:15.623
Look, you can see it here. It's wonderful!

896
00:55:15.903 --> 00:55:17.309
Emerald City!

897
00:55:19.739 --> 00:55:20.934
Oh...

898
00:55:21.764 --> 00:55:22.866
Oh...

899
00:55:23.117 --> 00:55:24.485
What's happening?

900
00:55:24.819 --> 00:55:26.187
What is it?

901
00:55:26.788 --> 00:55:28.322
I can't run anymore.

902
00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:30.191
I'm so sleepy.

903
00:55:30.258 --> 00:55:32.427
Here, give us your hands,
and we'll pull you along.

904
00:55:32.493 --> 00:55:33.628
Oh, no, please.

905
00:55:33.861 --> 00:55:36.064
I have to rest for just a minute.

906
00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:37.165
Toto!

907
00:55:37.231 --> 00:55:38.433
Where's Toto?

908
00:55:38.554 --> 00:55:41.169
Oh, you rest now. We're nearly there.

909
00:55:43.538 --> 00:55:46.107
Don't cry, you'll rust yourself again!

910
00:55:46.174 --> 00:55:49.477
Comin' to think of it,
forty winks wouldn't be bad.

911
00:55:50.344 --> 00:55:52.013
Don't you start it, too!

912
00:55:52.113 --> 00:55:54.716
Oh! We ought to try and carry Dorothy.

913
00:55:54.916 --> 00:55:57.018
I don't think I could, but we could try.

914
00:55:57.085 --> 00:55:58.252
- Let's.
- Yes.

915
00:55:59.184 --> 00:56:01.622
Oh, now look at him! This is terrible!

916
00:56:01.696 --> 00:56:03.219
Here, Tin Man, help me.

917
00:56:03.222 --> 00:56:03.731
Oh!

918
00:56:05.693 --> 00:56:08.629
Oh, this is terrible, can't budge her an inch!

919
00:56:08.996 --> 00:56:10.698
This is a spell, this is!

920
00:56:10.765 --> 00:56:13.134
It's the Wicked Witch! What'll we do?

921
00:56:13.868 --> 00:56:14.869
Help!

922
00:56:15.369 --> 00:56:16.370
Help!

923
00:56:16.537 --> 00:56:18.720
It's no use screaming at a time like this!

924
00:56:18.723 --> 00:56:19.921
Nobody will hear you!

925
00:56:19.924 --> 00:56:20.746
Help!

926
00:56:20.842 --> 00:56:22.944
Help, help!

927
00:56:24.752 --> 00:56:26.861
Help, help!

928
00:56:28.082 --> 00:56:29.317
It's snowing!

929
00:56:30.752 --> 00:56:32.086
No, it isn't!

930
00:56:33.588 --> 00:56:34.789
Yes, it is!

931
00:56:36.557 --> 00:56:38.025
Maybe that'll help!

932
00:56:38.835 --> 00:56:40.795
Oh, but it couldn't help.

933
00:56:41.763 --> 00:56:44.732
It does help. Dorothy, you're waking up!

934
00:56:46.929 --> 00:56:47.624
Oh...

935
00:56:48.228 --> 00:56:48.970
Oh!

936
00:56:48.973 --> 00:56:49.802
Oh...

937
00:56:50.263 --> 00:56:51.232
Ah...

938
00:56:52.306 --> 00:56:54.809
Unusual weather we're having, ain't it?

939
00:56:55.743 --> 00:56:57.712
Look, he's rusted again!

940
00:56:59.314 --> 00:57:02.690
- Oh, give me the oil can, quick! Oh-oh,
- Here! Oil him.

941
00:57:03.618 --> 00:57:04.919
- He is rusted.
- Here.

942
00:57:04.986 --> 00:57:05.729
Here.

943
00:57:06.260 --> 00:57:07.265
Quick, oh!

944
00:57:07.740 --> 00:57:08.717
Oh!

945
00:57:08.863 --> 00:57:12.400
Curses! Curses! Somebody always helps that girl!

946
00:57:14.829 --> 00:57:18.833
But shoes or no shoes, I'm still
great enough to conquer her.

947
00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:20.802
And woe to those who try to stop me!

948
00:57:20.935 --> 00:57:23.037
Come on, let's get out of here.

949
00:57:23.404 --> 00:57:26.352

Now, state your business!

976
00:58:58.585 --> 00:59:00.312
We want to see The Wizard.

977
00:59:00.315 --> 00:59:01.141
Ooh!

978
00:59:02.316 --> 00:59:03.420
The Wizard?!?

979
00:59:04.318 --> 00:59:06.788
But nobody can see The Great Oz!

980
00:59:07.021 --> 00:59:11.025
Nobody's ever seen The Great Oz!
Even I've never seen him!

981
00:59:11.459 --> 00:59:13.861
Well, then, how do you know there is one?

982
00:59:14.162 --> 00:59:16.673
Because he... I... oh!

983
00:59:17.265 --> 00:59:19.033

00:59:22.136 --> 00:59:23.938
I've got to see The Wizard.

986
00:59:24.205 --> 00:59:26.340
The Good Witch of the North sent me.

987
00:59:26.407 --> 00:59:27.442
Prove it!

988
00:59:27.542 --> 00:59:30.578
She's wearing the Ruby Slippers she gave her!

00:59:33.524 --> 00:59:36.351
Oh... so she is!

990
00:59:36.584 --> 00:59:38.984
Well, bust my buttons!

991
00:59:39.253 --> 00:59:41.663
Why didn't you say that in the first place?

992
00:59:41.889 --> 00:59:44.317
That's a horse of a different color!

993
00:59:44.319 --> 00:59:45.692
Come on in!

994
00:59:57.905 --> 01:00:00.975

The Wizard? The Wizard?

998
01:00:07.917 --> 01:00:09.061
I, can't...

999
01:00:09.356 --> 01:00:11.419
Well... yes, of course.

01:00:26.868 --> 01:00:28.756
No, and never will again, I fancy.

1006

Who's her? Who's her?

1077
01:02:30.324 --> 01:02:33.027
It's the witch! She's followed us here!

1078
01:02:33.130 --> 01:02:35.066
"Surrender Dorothy."

1079
01:02:36.631 --> 01:02:38.433
Dorothy? Who's Dorothy?

1080
01:02:38.499 --> 01:02:39.767
The Wizard will explain it!

1081
01:02:39.834 --> 01:02:41.549
To The Wizard!

1082
01:02:42.637 --> 01:02:44.172
Dear, whatever shall we do?

1083
01:02:44.238 --> 01:02:46.708
Well, we'd better hurry if we're
going to see The Wizard!

1084
01:02:48.876 --> 01:02:52.347
Here! Here, here! Everything is all right.

1085
01:02:52.513 --> 01:02:54.148
Stop that now. Just...

1086
01:02:54.151 --> 01:02:54.746
Every...

1087
01:02:54.749 --> 01:02:57.018
It's all right! Everything is all right!

1088
01:02:57.085 --> 01:03:01.699
The Great and Powerful Oz has
got matters well in hand.

1089
01:03:01.702 --> 01:03:02.573
I hope.

1090
01:03:02.623 --> 01:03:04.825
And so you can all go home!

1091
01:03:04.847 --> 01:03:06.630
And there's nothing to worry about!

1092
01:03:06.694 --> 01:03:09.527
Get out of here now! Go on. Go on home and I...

1093
01:03:09.790 --> 01:03:11.766
I... go home.

1094
01:03:12.633 --> 01:03:15.203
If you please, sir. We want to
see The Wizard right away.

1095
01:03:15.269 --> 01:03:16.337
All four of us.

1096
01:03:16.404 --> 01:03:19.040
Orders are: Nobody can see The Great Oz!

1097
01:03:19.107 --> 01:03:20.775
Not nobody, not nohow!

1098
01:03:20.857 --> 01:03:23.644
Oh, but, but please. It's very important.

1099
01:03:23.978 --> 01:03:26.280
And, and I got a permanent just for the occasion.

1100
01:03:26.347 --> 01:03:28.549
Not nobody! Not nohow!

1101
01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:30.485
But she's Dorothy!

1102
01:03:31.127 --> 01:03:32.795
The Witch's Dorothy?

1103
01:03:34.956 --> 01:03:36.904
Well, that makes a difference.

1104
01:03:36.907 --> 01:03:37.912
Just ah...

1105
01:03:38.426 --> 01:03:40.962
Wait here. I'll announce you at once!

1106
01:03:45.633 --> 01:03:48.269
Did you hear that? He'll announce us at once!

1107
01:03:48.369 --> 01:03:49.791
I've as good as got my brain!

1108
01:03:49.794 --> 01:03:51.674
I can fairly hear my heart beating.

1109
01:03:51.739 --> 01:03:53.497
I'll be home in time for supper!

1110
01:03:53.498 --> 01:03:55.810
In another hour, I'll be king of the forest.

1111
01:03:56.044 --> 01:03:58.079

Not even a rhinoceros?

1135
01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:29.966
Imposserous!

1136
01:06:30.264 --> 01:06:31.401
How about a hippopotamus?

1137
01:06:31.404 --> 01:06:34.371
Why, I'd trash him from top to bottomamus!

1138
01:06:34.435 --> 01:06:35.783
Supposin' you met an elephant?

1139
01:06:35.786 --> 01:06:37.474
I'd wrap him up in cellophant!

1140
01:06:37.569 --> 01:06:38.946
What if it were a brontosaurus?

1141
01:06:38.964 --> 01:06:41.457

1145
01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:47.715

01:06:47.782 --> 01:06:48.583
Courage!

1147
01:06:48.649 --> 01:06:51.652
What makes the flag on the mast to wave?

1148
01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:53.154
Courage!

1149
01:06:53.213 --> 01:06:55.217
What makes the elephant charge his tusk

1150
01:06:55.263 --> 01:06:58.210
in the misty mist, or the dusky dusk?

1151
01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:02.263
What makes the muskrat guard his musk?

1152
01:07:03.031 --> 01:07:03.898
Courage!

1153
01:07:03.965 --> 01:07:06.300
What makes the Sphinx the Seventh Wonder?

1154
01:07:06.367 --> 01:07:07.235
Courage!

1155
01:07:07.301 --> 01:07:09.837
What makes the dawn come up like thunder?

1156
01:07:10.872 --> 01:07:11.939
Courage!

1157
01:07:12.206 --> 01:07:14.242
What makes the Hottentot so hot?

1158
01:07:14.308 --> 01:07:16.377

Courage!

1161
01:07:20.014 --> 01:07:21.228
You can say that again.

1162
01:07:21.231 --> 01:07:22.380
Hah.

1163
01:07:23.218 --> 01:07:24.156
Huh!?

1164
01:07:24.159 --> 01:07:25.517
No!

1165
01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:28.089
The Wizard says, "Go away!"

1166
01:07:34.362 --> 01:07:35.530
Go away?

1167
01:07:36.898 --> 01:07:39.867
Looks like we came a long way for nothing.

1168
01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:41.413
Oh...

1169
01:07:42.070 --> 01:07:43.871
And I was so happy!

1170
01:07:44.939 --> 01:07:46.941
I thought I was on my way home.

1171
01:07:47.108 --> 01:07:48.443
Don't cry, Dorothy!

1172
01:07:48.509 --> 01:07:50.011
We're going to get you to The Wizard.

1173
01:07:50.078 --> 01:07:51.679
We certainly are!

1174
01:07:52.613 --> 01:07:56.551
Auntie Em was so good to me,
and I never appreciated it.

1175
01:07:57.418 --> 01:08:00.221
Running away and hurting her feelings.

1176
01:08:00.888 --> 01:08:03.057
Professor Marvel said she was sick.

1177
01:08:04.592 --> 01:08:06.060
She may be dying

1178
01:08:06.234 --> 01:08:08.396
and, and it's all my fault!

1179
01:08:11.298 --> 01:08:13.301
Oh, I'll never forgive myself!

1180
01:08:14.335 --> 01:08:15.903
Never, never, never!

1181
01:08:20.441 --> 01:08:22.977
Please, don't cry anymore.

1182
01:08:23.544 --> 01:08:26.614
I'll get you in to The Wizard somehow.

1183
01:08:26.774 --> 01:08:30.551
Come on. I had an Aunt Em myself once!

1184
01:08:51.472 --> 01:08:54.308
Wait a minute, fellahs. I was just thinkin'.

1185
01:08:54.542 --> 01:08:56.978
I really don't want to see The Wizard this much.

1186
01:08:57.045 --> 01:08:59.013
I better wait for you outside.

1187
01:08:59.154 --> 01:09:02.090
- What's the matter?
- Oh, he's just a'scared again.

1188
01:09:02.150 --> 01:09:04.886
Don't you know The Wizard's going
to give you some courage?

1189
01:09:04.952 --> 01:09:07.588
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.

1190
01:09:08.322 --> 01:09:10.425
Oh, well, then, we'll ask him for you.

1191
01:09:10.758 --> 01:09:12.460
I'd sooner wait outside.

1192
01:09:12.798 --> 01:09:14.710
But why? Why?

1193
01:09:14.929 --> 01:09:17.465
Because I'm still scared!

1194
01:09:19.766 --> 01:09:21.204
Ohh!

1195
01:09:22.060 --> 01:09:22.999
What happened?

1196
01:09:23.002 --> 01:09:25.349
Somebody pulled my tail.

1197
01:09:25.815 --> 01:09:27.039
Oh, you did it yourself!

1198
01:09:27.042 --> 01:09:28.705
I... oh...

1199
01:09:30.011 --> 01:09:31.012
Come on.

1200
01:09:34.749 --> 01:09:37.085
Come forward!

1201
01:09:37.418 --> 01:09:39.187
Tell me when it's over!

1202
01:09:50.498 --> 01:09:52.333
Oh! Look at that! Look at that!

1203
01:09:56.504 --> 01:09:58.673
I want to go home!

1204
01:09:59.340 --> 01:10:02.410
I am Oz

1205
01:10:02.910 --> 01:10:05.079
The great and powerful!

1206
01:10:05.646 --> 01:10:06.981
Who are you?

1207
01:10:09.217 --> 01:10:10.818
Who are you?

1208
01:10:16.657 --> 01:10:19.799
I, if you please, I... I am Dorothy,

1209
01:10:20.661 --> 01:10:22.497
the small and meek.

1210
01:10:24.506 --> 01:10:25.974
We've come to ask you...

1211
01:10:26.334 --> 01:10:27.374
Silence!

1212
01:10:27.377 --> 01:10:27.936
Ohhh,

1213
01:10:28.526 --> 01:10:30.605
Oh, Jiminy crickets!

1214
01:10:31.005 --> 01:10:36.763
The great and powerful Oz
knows why you have come.

1215
01:10:37.378 --> 01:10:40.081
Step forward, tin man!

1216
01:10:40.889 --> 01:10:42.022
Ohhhh!

1217
01:10:46.487 --> 01:10:50.324
You dare to come to me for a heart, do you?

1218
01:10:50.892 --> 01:10:56.594
You clinking, clanking, clattering
collection of caliginous junk!

1219
01:10:57.075 --> 01:10:58.036
Ohhhh!

1220
01:10:59.851 --> 01:11:01.636
Eh, yes... Yes, sir.

1221
01:11:01.969 --> 01:11:03.338
Y-Yes, your honor.

1222
01:11:03.638 --> 01:11:06.240
You see, a while back

1223
01:11:06.507 --> 01:11:09.077
we were walking down the
Yellow Brick Road, and...

1224
01:11:09.143 --> 01:11:10.178
Quiet!

1225
01:11:10.201 --> 01:11:11.615
Ohhhhhh!

1226
01:11:12.847 --> 01:11:14.982
And you, Scarecrow

1227
01:11:15.383 --> 01:11:18.086
Have the effrontery to ask for a brain.

1228
01:11:18.886 --> 01:11:22.423
You billowing bale of bovine fodder!

1229
01:11:24.792 --> 01:11:26.961
Yes, your honor. I mean, your excellency.

1230
01:11:27.028 --> 01:11:28.863
I mean, your Wizardry.

1231
01:11:29.530 --> 01:11:30.498
Enough!

1232
01:11:31.329 --> 01:11:34.507
Uh, and you, Lion!

1233
01:11:40.274 --> 01:11:41.242
Well?

1234
01:11:43.183 --> 01:11:44.761
Oh, oh!

1235
01:11:48.082 --> 01:11:50.351
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

1236
01:11:50.785 --> 01:11:53.688
Frightening him like that
when he came to you for help!

1237
01:11:53.755 --> 01:11:55.957
Silence, whippersnapper!

1238
01:11:56.657 --> 01:12:01.851
The beneficient Oz has every
intention of granting your requests!

1239
01:12:02.263 --> 01:12:05.400
What's that? What'd he say? Huh? What'd he say?

1240
01:12:05.633 --> 01:12:09.270
But first, you must prove yourselves worthy

1241
01:12:09.570 --> 01:12:13.528
by performing a very small task.

1242
01:12:14.342 --> 01:12:17.255
Bring me the broomstick of the Witch of the West.

1243
01:12:17.258 --> 01:12:21.282
B-b-b-but if we do that, we'll
have to kill her to get it!

1244
01:12:21.349 --> 01:12:23.651
Bring me her broomstick

1245
01:12:24.052 --> 01:12:26.898
and I'll grant your requests.

1246
01:12:27.355 --> 01:12:28.922
Now, go!

1247
01:12:28.925 --> 01:12:31.993
But, but what if she kills us first?

1248
01:12:32.060 --> 01:12:33.728
I said, "Go!"

1249
01:13:19.741 --> 01:13:22.810
"I'd turn back if I were you!"

1250
01:13:29.177 --> 01:13:30.396
Grolf.

1251
01:13:31.290 --> 01:13:32.321
Grolf!

1252
01:13:33.996 --> 01:13:35.402
Grrrolf!

1253
01:13:47.368 --> 01:13:48.870
Oh, look! Look! Look!

1254
01:13:53.875 --> 01:13:56.177
I believe there're spooks around here.

1255
01:13:56.911 --> 01:13:59.747
That's ridiculous! Spooks! That's silly.

1256
01:14:00.214 --> 01:14:02.383
Don't you believe in spooks?

1257
01:14:02.472 --> 01:14:03.679
No. Why only... Oh,

1258
01:14:03.682 --> 01:14:07.711
Oh! Oh, Tin Man! Oh!

1259
01:14:13.582 --> 01:14:15.596
Oh, are you, are you all right?

1260
01:14:15.663 --> 01:14:17.730
I do believe in spooks, I do believe in spooks.

1261
01:14:17.771 --> 01:14:19.268
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do.

1262
01:14:19.286 --> 01:14:21.981
I do believe in spooks. I do believe in spooks!

1263
01:14:21.991 --> 01:14:23.829
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do.

1264
01:14:23.832 --> 01:14:24.739
I do!

1265
01:14:26.174 --> 01:14:29.644
You'll believe in more than that
before I'm finished with you.

1266
01:14:31.479 --> 01:14:34.849
Take your army to The Haunted Forest
and bring me that girl and her dog.

1267
01:14:34.916 --> 01:14:38.286
Do what you like with the others, but
I want her alive and unharmed!

1268
01:14:38.353 --> 01:14:41.022
They'll give you no trouble. I promise you that.

1269
01:14:41.089 --> 01:14:44.250
I've sent a little insect on ahead
to take the fight out of them.

1270
01:14:45.827 --> 01:14:49.716
Take special care of those Ruby Slippers.
I want those most of all.

1271
01:14:49.794 --> 01:14:51.737
Now, fly! Fly!

1272
01:14:51.740 --> 01:14:53.991
Bring me that girl and her slippers!

1273
01:14:54.369 --> 01:14:56.904
Fly! Fly! Fly!

1274
01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:25.900
Help!

1275
01:15:25.958 --> 01:15:27.326
Help! Help!

1276
01:15:27.969 --> 01:15:29.137
Go away now!

1277
01:15:30.038 --> 01:15:31.205
Help! Help!

1278
01:15:32.507 --> 01:15:35.276
Toto! Toto! Help! Toto!

1279
01:15:36.827 --> 01:15:37.249
Aahhh! Arf! Arf!

1280
01:15:37.252 --> 01:15:37.729
Aahhh!

1281
01:15:37.732 --> 01:15:38.334
Aahhh! Arf!

1282
01:15:38.558 --> 01:15:38.941
Aahhh!

1283
01:15:38.944 --> 01:15:39.897
Aahhh! Arf! Arf! Arf!

1284
01:15:40.985 --> 01:15:41.548
Arf!

1285
01:15:50.180 --> 01:15:52.745
Help! Help! Help!

1286
01:15:52.748 --> 01:15:55.164
Oh! Well, what happened to you?

1287
01:15:55.229 --> 01:15:57.665
They tore my legs off and threw them over there!

1288
01:15:57.732 --> 01:16:00.134
Then they took my chest out
and threw it over there!

1289
01:16:00.201 --> 01:16:01.917
Well, that's you all over.

1290
01:16:01.971 --> 01:16:03.945
They sure knocked the stuffings
out of you, didn't they?

1291
01:16:04.005 --> 01:16:06.174
Don't stand there talking! Put me together!

1292
01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:07.742
We've got to find Dorothy!

1293
01:16:07.809 --> 01:16:09.177
Now, let's see...

1294
01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:14.248
What a nice little dog.

1295
01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:22.223
And you, my dear, what an unexpected pleasure.

1296
01:16:22.757 --> 01:16:26.060
It's so kind of you to visit me in my loneliness.

1297
01:16:28.496 --> 01:16:31.532
What are you going to do with my dog?
Give him back to me!

1298
01:16:31.599 --> 01:16:36.004
All in good time, my little
pretty, all in good time.

1299
01:16:36.237 --> 01:16:38.272
Oh, please give me back my dog!

1300
01:16:38.339 --> 01:16:40.476
Certainly, certainly...

1301
01:16:40.808 --> 01:16:43.435
when you give me those slippers.

1302
01:16:43.745 --> 01:16:46.080
But The Good Witch of the North told me not to.

1303
01:16:46.147 --> 01:16:47.248
Very well.

1304
01:16:47.815 --> 01:16:49.951
Throw that basket in the river and drown him.

1305
01:16:50.018 --> 01:16:51.753
No! No. No. Here.

1306
01:16:51.919 --> 01:16:54.455
You can have your old slippers
but give me back Toto!

1307
01:16:54.522 --> 01:16:56.324
That's a good little girl.

1308
01:16:56.391 --> 01:16:58.626
I knew you'd see reason!

1309
01:16:59.475 --> 01:17:01.229
Ahhh!

1310
01:17:01.627 --> 01:17:02.271
Ah!

1311
01:17:02.296 --> 01:17:05.633
I'm sorry. I didn't do it.
Can I still have my dog?

1312
01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:08.803
No! Fool that I am, I should have remembered

1313
01:17:10.304 --> 01:17:12.707
those slippers will never come off

1314
01:17:12.745 --> 01:17:16.154
as long as you're alive.

1315
01:17:16.811 --> 01:17:20.348
But that's not what's worrying me.
It's how to do it.

1316
01:17:20.915 --> 01:17:23.799
These things must be done delicately

1317
01:17:23.951 --> 01:17:26.281
or you hurt the spell.

1318
01:17:26.421 --> 01:17:27.588
Run, Toto! Run!

1319
01:17:27.655 --> 01:17:29.157
Catch him, you fool!

1320
01:17:37.117 --> 01:17:39.197
Ahhh!

1321
01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:40.633
Run, Toto, run!

1322
01:17:41.936 --> 01:17:43.304
Run, Toto, run!

1323
01:17:45.073 --> 01:17:47.475
He got away! He got away!

1324
01:17:47.599 --> 01:17:51.946
Ohhh! Which is more than you will!
Drat you and your dog!

1325
01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:55.116
You've been more trouble to me
than you're worth, one way or another

1326
01:17:55.183 --> 01:17:57.185
but it'll soon be over now!

1327
01:18:00.054 --> 01:18:03.825
Do you see that? That's how much
longer you've got to be alive!

1328
01:18:03.992 --> 01:18:06.894
And it isn't long, my pretty. It isn't long!

1329
01:18:07.061 --> 01:18:09.464
I can't wait forever to get those shoes!

1330
01:18:31.886 --> 01:18:33.187
I'm frightened.

1331
01:18:34.026 --> 01:18:36.758
I'm frightened, Auntie Em, I'm frightened!

1332
01:18:40.261 --> 01:18:41.229
Dorothy?

1333
01:18:42.130 --> 01:18:44.365
Dorothy, where are you?

1334
01:18:44.799 --> 01:18:46.701
It's me, it's Auntie Em.

1335
01:18:47.068 --> 01:18:49.871
We're trying to find you! Where are you?

1336
01:18:50.538 --> 01:18:52.507
I'm here in Oz, Auntie Em!

1337
01:18:52.774 --> 01:18:55.076
I'm locked up in the witch's castle

1338
01:18:55.243 --> 01:18:58.079
and I'm trying to get home to you, Auntie Em!

1339
01:18:58.913 --> 01:19:02.322
Oh, Auntie Em, don't go away! I'm frightened!

1340
01:19:03.017 --> 01:19:04.786
Come back! Come back!

1341
01:19:04.852 --> 01:19:07.588
"Auntie Em. Auntie Em, come back!"

1342
01:19:07.955 --> 01:19:10.479
I'll give you Auntie Em, my pretty!

1343
01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:23.507
Arf!

1344
01:19:23.973 --> 01:19:24.879
Arf! Arf!

1345
01:19:25.372 --> 01:19:25.981
Arf! Arf!

1346
01:19:26.909 --> 01:19:27.612
Arf! Arf!

1347
01:19:30.698 --> 01:19:31.167
Arf!

1348
01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:31.893
Arf!

1349
01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:35.945
Arf!

1350
01:19:36.088 --> 01:19:36.877
Arf! Arf!

1351
01:19:37.018 --> 01:19:38.486
Look! There's Toto!

1352
01:19:38.537 --> 01:19:39.184
Arf! Arf!

1353
01:19:39.187 --> 01:19:40.722
Where'd he come from?

1354
01:19:40.924 --> 01:19:41.408
Arf! Arf!

1355
01:19:41.695 --> 01:19:42.187
Arf!

1356
01:19:42.223 --> 01:19:45.693
Why, don't you see? He's
come to take us to Dorothy!

1357
01:19:46.523 --> 01:19:47.406
Arf! Arf!

1358
01:19:47.662 --> 01:19:49.263
Come on, fellows!

1359
01:19:50.742 --> 01:19:51.531
Arf! Arf!

1360
01:19:52.118 --> 01:19:52.579
Arf!

1361
01:19:53.181 --> 01:19:53.720
Arf! Arf!

1362
01:19:56.450 --> 01:19:57.028
Arf! Arf!

1363
01:20:02.398 --> 01:20:04.968
Oh! Oh!

1364
01:20:07.108 --> 01:20:10.151
I, I, I hope my strength holds out.

1365
01:20:10.284 --> 01:20:12.034
I hope your tail holds out.

1366
01:20:12.037 --> 01:20:13.213
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1367
01:20:25.233 --> 01:20:26.367
What's that? What's that?

1368
01:20:27.317 --> 01:20:29.352
That's the castle of the Wicked Witch!

1369
01:20:29.537 --> 01:20:31.339
Dorothy's in that awful place?

1370
01:20:31.406 --> 01:20:34.876
Oh, I hate to think of her in there.
We've got to get her out!

1371
01:20:35.025 --> 01:20:37.561
Don't cry now. We haven't got the oil can with us

1372
01:20:37.612 --> 01:20:39.681
and you've been squeaking enough as it is.

1373
01:20:39.881 --> 01:20:41.382
Who's them? Who's them?

1374
01:20:43.292 --> 01:20:46.774
♪ O-ee-yah! Eoh-ah! ♪

1375
01:20:47.187 --> 01:20:50.576
♪ O-ee-yah! Eoh-ah! ♪

1376
01:20:51.249 --> 01:20:54.709
♪ O-ee-yah! Eoh-ah! ♪

1377
01:20:56.297 --> 01:20:58.366
I've got a plan how to get in there.

1378
01:20:58.433 --> 01:21:00.134
Fine. He's got a plan.

1379
01:21:00.201 --> 01:21:01.469
And you're going to lead us.

1380
01:21:01.472 --> 01:21:02.605
Yeah...

1381
01:21:03.187 --> 01:21:04.569
- Me?
- Yes, you.

1382
01:21:04.572 --> 01:21:05.306
I...

1383
01:21:06.013 --> 01:21:07.559
I, I, gotta get her outta there?

1384
01:21:07.562 --> 01:21:08.712
That's right.

1385
01:21:10.178 --> 01:21:12.680
All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy.

1386
01:21:13.021 --> 01:21:15.183
Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch.

1387
01:21:15.249 --> 01:21:18.086
Guards or no guards, I'll tear 'em apart.

1388
01:21:18.089 --> 01:21:18.529
Ruff!

1389
01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:22.690
I may not come out alive but I'm going in there.

1390
01:21:23.124 --> 01:21:25.593
There's only one thing I want you fellows to do.

1391
01:21:25.660 --> 01:21:26.894
What's that?

1392
01:21:27.362 --> 01:21:28.796
Talk me out of it.

1393
01:21:31.432 --> 01:21:32.422
No, you don't. Oh, no!

1394
01:21:32.425 --> 01:21:33.667
No? Now, wait a minute.

1395
01:21:33.670 --> 01:21:35.098
- Up!
- Now?

1396
01:21:49.959 --> 01:21:50.318
Arf!

1397
01:21:50.747 --> 01:21:51.379
- Arf!
- Sssh,

1398
01:22:05.165 --> 01:22:05.778
Ugh!

1399
01:22:05.781 --> 01:22:06.528
Sssh,

1400
01:22:06.796 --> 01:22:07.568
Sssh,

♪ O-ee-yah! Eoh-ah! ♪

1402
01:22:33.212 --> 01:22:34.797
♪ O-ee-yah! ♪

1403
01:22:34.925 --> 01:22:36.798
I've got another idea.

1404
01:22:36.864 --> 01:22:39.500
Do you think it'll be polite,
dropping in like this?

1405
01:22:39.570 --> 01:22:40.571
Come on.

1406
01:22:41.349 --> 01:22:44.952
♪ O-ee-yah! Eoh-ah! ♪

1411
01:23:14.135 --> 01:23:15.803
Where do we go now?

1412
01:23:16.204 --> 01:23:16.704
Yeah.

1413
01:23:16.707 --> 01:23:17.386
Arf! Arf!

1414
01:23:18.323 --> 01:23:18.636
Arf!

1415
01:23:18.980 --> 01:23:20.014
There!

1416
01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:25.985
Arf! Arf!

1417
01:23:28.167 --> 01:23:28.517
Arf!

1418
01:23:29.782 --> 01:23:31.461
Wait! We'd better make sure.

1419
01:23:31.511 --> 01:23:32.839
Dorothy, are you in there?

1420
01:23:32.892 --> 01:23:33.921
It's us!

1421
01:23:34.122 --> 01:23:36.157
Yes, it's me!

1422
01:23:36.424 --> 01:23:37.892
She's locked me in!

1423
01:23:37.908 --> 01:23:40.775
Listen, fellows. It's her. We
gotta get her out! Open this door!

1424
01:23:40.778 --> 01:23:43.031
Oh, hurry, please hurry!

1425
01:23:43.164 --> 01:23:45.099
The hourglass is almost empty!

1426
01:23:45.166 --> 01:23:46.267
Stand back!

1427
01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:01.923
Oh!

1428
01:24:02.641 --> 01:24:04.285
Oh! Toto, Toto!

1429
01:24:04.352 --> 01:24:06.461
- Dorothy!
- Lion, darling, I knew you'd come!

1430
01:24:06.523 --> 01:24:07.655
I knew you would!

1431
01:24:07.722 --> 01:24:09.924
Hurry, we've got no time to lose!

1432
01:24:21.869 --> 01:24:23.438
Going so soon?

1433
01:24:23.805 --> 01:24:25.506
I wouldn't hear of it.

1434
01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:29.610
Why, my little party's just beginning.

1435
01:24:29.711 --> 01:24:32.013
Trapped! Trapped like mice, er, rats!

1436
01:24:36.769 --> 01:24:37.213
Arf!

1437
01:24:41.022 --> 01:24:43.624
That's right. Don't hurt them right away.

1438
01:24:44.125 --> 01:24:46.761
We'll let them think about it a little, first.

1439
01:24:57.672 --> 01:24:59.101
Seize them!

1440
01:24:59.123 --> 01:25:00.123
Stop them, you fools!

1441
01:25:00.174 --> 01:25:03.344
Stop them! Seize them! Seize them!

1442
01:25:13.321 --> 01:25:15.356
There they go! Ah, now we've got them!

1443
01:25:15.423 --> 01:25:17.825
Half you go this way, half you go that way!

1444
01:25:17.892 --> 01:25:19.160
Hurry! Hurry!

1445
01:25:26.868 --> 01:25:28.336
Where do we go now?

1446
01:25:29.037 --> 01:25:30.705
This way, come on!

1447
01:25:36.580 --> 01:25:37.421
Ohh!

1448
01:25:38.346 --> 01:25:39.480
Back! Back!

1449
01:25:49.261 --> 01:25:50.080
Ohh!

1450
01:25:58.199 --> 01:25:59.200
Well...

1451
01:26:00.034 --> 01:26:02.804
Ring around the rosie! A pocket full of spears!

1452
01:26:02.904 --> 01:26:04.765
Thought you'd be pretty foxy, didn't you?

1453
01:26:04.768 --> 01:26:05.541
Well...

1454
01:26:05.707 --> 01:26:09.877
The last to go will see the
first three go before her!

1455
01:26:11.446 --> 01:26:13.348
And her mangy little dog, too!

1456
01:26:21.556 --> 01:26:23.725
How about a little fire, Scarecrow?

1457
01:26:23.791 --> 01:26:25.893
No, no, no!

1458
01:26:26.060 --> 01:26:29.520
Help! I'm burning! I'm burning!
It's happening! Help!

1459
01:26:29.576 --> 01:26:31.244
Don't throw that water!

1460
01:26:32.326 --> 01:26:33.442
Ahhhh!

1461
01:26:33.601 --> 01:26:36.004
You cursed brat! Look what you've done!

1462
01:26:36.104 --> 01:26:38.206
I'm melting! Melting!

1463
01:26:38.685 --> 01:26:41.409
Oh, what a world, what a world!

1464
01:26:41.476 --> 01:26:46.314
Who would have thought a good little girl
could destroy my beautiful wickedness?

1465
01:26:46.492 --> 01:26:49.283
Ohhh! Look out! Look out!

1466
01:26:49.917 --> 01:26:51.019
I'm going.

1467
01:26:51.191 --> 01:26:52.641
Ohhh!

1468
01:26:53.083 --> 01:26:54.380
Ohhh!

1469
01:26:54.526 --> 01:26:58.566
ᴼʰʰʰ...

1470
01:27:07.025 --> 01:27:09.871
She's... she's... dead! You've killed her!

1471
01:27:09.937 --> 01:27:12.807
I didn't mean to kill her, really I didn't.

1472
01:27:13.672 --> 01:27:16.277
It's... it's just that he was on fire!

1473
01:27:16.344 --> 01:27:18.913
Hail to Dorothy! The Wicked Witch is dead!

1474
01:27:19.013 --> 01:27:22.483
Hail! Hail to Dorothy! The Wicked Witch is dead!

1475
01:27:23.251 --> 01:27:24.452
The broom!

1476
01:27:24.519 --> 01:27:25.553
May we have it?

1477
01:27:25.620 --> 01:27:27.208
Please. And take it with you.

1478
01:27:27.211 --> 01:27:29.123
Oh, thank you so much!

1479
01:27:29.590 --> 01:27:32.794
Now we can go back to The Wizard and
tell him the Wicked Witch is dead!

1480
01:27:32.860 --> 01:27:34.495
The Wicked Witch is dead!

1481
01:27:34.562 --> 01:27:36.698
Can I believe my eyes?

1482
01:27:37.231 --> 01:27:39.406
Why have you come back?

1483
01:27:41.202 --> 01:27:44.138
Please, sir. We've done what you told us.

1484
01:27:44.439 --> 01:27:47.185
We've brought you the broomstick
of The Wicked Witch of the West.

1485
01:27:47.942 --> 01:27:49.277
We melted her.

1486
01:27:49.765 --> 01:27:52.981
Oh, you liquidated her, eh?

1487
01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:54.922
Very resourceful!

1488
01:27:54.983 --> 01:27:59.620
Yes, sir. So we'd like you to keep your
promise to us, if you please, sir.

1489
01:27:59.754 --> 01:28:02.557
Not so fast! Not so fast!

1490
01:28:03.257 --> 01:28:05.960
I'll have to give the matter a little thought!

1491
01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:08.563
Go away, and come back tomorrow!

1492
01:28:08.997 --> 01:28:10.031
Tomorrow?

1493
01:28:10.531 --> 01:28:12.734
Oh, but I want to go home now.

1494
01:28:13.601 --> 01:28:15.470
You've had plenty of time already!

1495
01:28:15.536 --> 01:28:16.437
Yeah!

1496
01:28:16.504 --> 01:28:20.310
Do not arouse the wrath of
the great and powerful Oz!

1497
01:28:20.875 --> 01:28:23.261
I said, "Come back tomorrow!"

1498
01:28:23.790 --> 01:28:27.181
If you were really great and
powerful, you'd keep your promises!

1499
01:28:27.248 --> 01:28:30.789
Do you presume to criticize the great oz?

1500
01:28:31.185 --> 01:28:33.421
You ungrateful creatures!

1501
01:28:33.688 --> 01:28:37.690
Think yourselves lucky that I'm
giving you audience tomorrow

1502
01:28:37.725 --> 01:28:40.261
instead of 20 years from now!

1503
01:28:40.764 --> 01:28:41.383
Oh!

1504
01:28:42.296 --> 01:28:44.565
The great Oz has spoken!

1505
01:28:45.389 --> 01:28:46.045
Oh!

1506
01:28:46.834 --> 01:28:50.071
Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain.

1507
01:28:50.772 --> 01:28:53.941
The great and... Oz... Has spoken!

1508
01:28:54.378 --> 01:28:55.579
Who are you?

1509
01:28:55.646 --> 01:28:56.293
Oh... I...

1510
01:28:56.448 --> 01:28:58.680
I, I am the great and powerful

1511
01:28:58.780 --> 01:29:00.515
Wizard of Oz.

1512
01:29:00.581 --> 01:29:01.616
You are?

1513
01:29:02.283 --> 01:29:03.751
I don't believe you!

1514
01:29:03.851 --> 01:29:07.255
No, I'm afraid it's true. There's
no other Wizard except me.

1515
01:29:07.422 --> 01:29:08.556
You humbug!

1516
01:29:08.623 --> 01:29:09.590
Yeah!

1517
01:29:09.805 --> 01:29:13.161
Yes. Yes that's exactly so. I'm a humbug!

1518
01:29:13.344 --> 01:29:13.975
Oh...

1519
01:29:14.595 --> 01:29:16.364
You're a very bad man!

1520
01:29:16.984 --> 01:29:20.034
Oh, no, my dear, I'm, I'm a very good man.

1521
01:29:20.134 --> 01:29:23.071
I'm just a very bad Wizard.

1522
01:29:23.621 --> 01:29:26.007
What about the heart that you promised Tin Man?

1523
01:29:26.107 --> 01:29:28.443
And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?

1524
01:29:28.509 --> 01:29:30.011
And Scarecrow's brain?

1525
01:29:30.078 --> 01:29:34.248
Why, anybody can have a brain.
That's a very mediocre commodity.

1526
01:29:34.415 --> 01:29:37.452
Every pusillanimous creature
that crawls on the earth

1527
01:29:37.518 --> 01:29:40.555
or slinks through slimy seas has a brain!

1528
01:29:40.855 --> 01:29:43.191
Back where I come from we have universities,

1529
01:29:43.269 --> 01:29:46.873
seats of great learning, where
men go to become great thinkers.

1530
01:29:47.061 --> 01:29:49.397
And when they come out, they think deep thoughts

1531
01:29:49.464 --> 01:29:51.399
with no more brains than you have.

1532
01:29:51.466 --> 01:29:54.869
But they have one thing you
haven't got: A diploma!

1533
01:29:55.336 --> 01:29:59.507
Therefore, by virtue of the
authority vested in me

1534
01:29:59.707 --> 01:30:03.411
by the Universitatus
Committeeatum E Pluribus Unum

1535
01:30:03.745 --> 01:30:05.980
I hereby confer upon you

1536
01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:08.583
the honorary degree of Th.D.

1537
01:30:09.817 --> 01:30:10.752
Th.D.?

1538
01:30:10.818 --> 01:30:13.521
Yeah, that... That's Dr. of Thinkology!

1539
01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:16.603
The sum of the square roots of any
two sides of an isosceles triangle

1540
01:30:16.616 --> 01:30:19.241
is equal to the square root
of the remaining side.

1541
01:30:20.801 --> 01:30:22.463
Oh joy, rapture!

1542
01:30:23.064 --> 01:30:24.432
I've got a brain!

1543
01:30:24.666 --> 01:30:26.401
How can I ever thank you enough?

1544
01:30:26.467 --> 01:30:27.306
Well, you can't.

1545
01:30:27.309 --> 01:30:28.906
As for you, my fine friend,

1546
01:30:28.907 --> 01:30:31.239
you are a victim of disorganized thinking.

1547
01:30:31.339 --> 01:30:33.408
You're under the unfortunate delusion

1548
01:30:33.474 --> 01:30:36.711
that simply because you run away
from danger you have no courage.

1549
01:30:36.778 --> 01:30:39.447
You are confusing courage with wisdom.

1550
01:30:39.514 --> 01:30:43.284
Back where I come from we have
men who are called heroes.

1551
01:30:43.685 --> 01:30:46.831
Once a year they take their
fortitude out of mothballs

1552
01:30:46.834 --> 01:30:49.357
and parade it down the main street of the city.

1553
01:30:49.424 --> 01:30:51.759
And they have no more courage than you have.

1554
01:30:51.826 --> 01:30:54.729
But they have one thing that you haven't got:

1555
01:30:55.229 --> 01:30:56.230
A medal!

1556
01:30:57.031 --> 01:31:00.335
Therefore, for meritorious conduct

1557
01:31:00.802 --> 01:31:05.406
extraordinary valor, conspicuous
bravery against wicked witches

1558
01:31:05.506 --> 01:31:07.909
I award you The Triple Cross.

1559
01:31:08.609 --> 01:31:11.746
You are now a member of The Legion Of Courage!

1560
01:31:15.132 --> 01:31:18.086
Oh, shucks, folks, I'm speechless!

1561
01:31:19.187 --> 01:31:22.991
As for you, my galvanized
friend, you want a heart!

1562
01:31:23.257 --> 01:31:26.127
You don't know how lucky you are not to have one.

1563
01:31:26.194 --> 01:31:30.465
Hearts will never be practical until
they can be made unbreakable.

1564
01:31:31.133 --> 01:31:33.001
But I still want one.

1565
01:31:33.551 --> 01:31:37.705
Back where I come from there are men
who do nothing all day but good deeds.

1566
01:31:37.905 --> 01:31:40.614
They are called Phil... Er, er, Phil, er, yes..

1567
01:31:40.867 --> 01:31:42.838
Er, Good-Deed-Doers.

1568
01:31:42.841 --> 01:31:44.983
And their hearts are no bigger than yours.

1569
01:31:44.986 --> 01:31:48.783
But they have one thing you
haven't got: A testimonial!

1570
01:31:49.046 --> 01:31:52.287
Therefore, in consideration of your kindness

1571
01:31:52.334 --> 01:31:55.304
I take pleasure at this time in presenting you

1572
01:31:55.370 --> 01:31:58.674
with a small token of our esteem and affection.

1573
01:31:59.141 --> 01:32:01.510
And remember, my sentimental friend

1574
01:32:02.110 --> 01:32:05.080
that a heart is not judged by how much you love

1575
01:32:05.547 --> 01:32:08.083
but by how much you are loved by others.

1576
01:32:08.475 --> 01:32:09.347
Ahh...

1577
01:32:11.384 --> 01:32:13.822
Oh, it ticks! Listen!

1578
01:32:14.330 --> 01:32:15.791
Look, it ticks!

1579
01:32:16.959 --> 01:32:18.527
Rea-read what my medal says.

1580
01:32:18.594 --> 01:32:19.428
"Courage"!

1581
01:32:19.494 --> 01:32:21.474
Ain't it the truth? Ain't it the truth?

1582
01:32:21.477 --> 01:32:23.899
Oh, oh, they're all wonderful.

1583
01:32:23.950 --> 01:32:26.562
Hey, what about Dorothy?

1584
01:32:26.565 --> 01:32:27.662
Yes, how about Dorothy?

1585
01:32:27.665 --> 01:32:28.305
Yeah.

1586
01:32:28.403 --> 01:32:29.397
Dorothy next!

1587
01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:30.457
Yes. Dorothy, ah,

1588
01:32:30.539 --> 01:32:33.508
I don't think there's anything
in that black bag for me.

1589
01:32:33.559 --> 01:32:36.545
Well, you force me into a cataclysmic decision.

1590
01:32:36.612 --> 01:32:40.816
The only way to get Dorothy back to Kansas
is for me to take her there myself!

1591
01:32:41.952 --> 01:32:43.986
Oh, will you? Could you?

1592
01:32:44.386 --> 01:32:45.380
Oh!

1593
01:32:46.067 --> 01:32:48.457
Oh, but are you a clever
enough Wizard to manage it?

1594
01:32:48.523 --> 01:32:52.527
Child, you cut me to the quick!
I'm an old Kansas man myself

1595
01:32:52.694 --> 01:32:55.664
born and bred - in the heart
of the western wilderness,

1596
01:32:55.731 --> 01:32:57.766
premier balloonist par excellence

1597
01:32:57.836 --> 01:33:00.027
for the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company.

1598
01:33:00.030 --> 01:33:04.840
Until one day while performing
spectacular feats of stratospheric skill

1599
01:33:04.973 --> 01:33:09.778
never before attempted by civilized man,
an unfortunate phenomenon occurred.

1600
01:33:10.045 --> 01:33:12.180
The balloon failed to return to the fair.

1601
01:33:12.247 --> 01:33:13.048
It did?

1602
01:33:13.115 --> 01:33:14.449
Weren't you frightened?

1603
01:33:14.516 --> 01:33:18.220
Frightened? You are talking to a man
who has laughed in the face of death

1604
01:33:18.286 --> 01:33:21.455
sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe.

1605
01:33:21.623 --> 01:33:22.991
I was petrified.

1606
01:33:23.158 --> 01:33:26.361
Then suddenly the wind changed
and the balloon floated down

1607
01:33:26.428 --> 01:33:30.933
into the heart of this noble city
where I was instantly acclaimed Oz

1608
01:33:31.033 --> 01:33:32.731
the first Wizard deluxe!

1609
01:33:32.734 --> 01:33:33.541
Ohhh!

1610
01:33:33.735 --> 01:33:36.705
Times being what they were, I accepted the job

1611
01:33:36.939 --> 01:33:40.709
retaining my balloon against
the advent of a quick getaway.

1612
01:33:41.376 --> 01:33:45.414
And in that balloon, my dear
Dorothy, you and I will return

1613
01:33:45.480 --> 01:33:47.916
to the land of "E Pluribus Unum"!

1614
01:34:02.370 --> 01:34:06.174
This is positively the finest
exhibition ever to be shown.

1615
01:34:06.177 --> 01:34:06.962
Ah, eh...

1616
01:34:07.002 --> 01:34:09.238
Yes, well, be that as it may.

1617
01:34:09.304 --> 01:34:13.008
I, your Wizard par ardua ad alta,

1618
01:34:13.208 --> 01:34:18.688
am about to embark upon a hazardous
and technically unexplainable journey

1619
01:34:18.747 --> 01:34:21.283
into the outer stratosphere!

1620
01:34:25.087 --> 01:34:30.325
To confer, converse and otherwise
hobnob with my brother Wizards.

1621
01:34:30.759 --> 01:34:34.329
And I hereby decree that until what time...

1622
01:34:34.496 --> 01:34:35.315
if any...

1623
01:34:35.318 --> 01:34:38.269
That I return, the Scarecrow

1624
01:34:38.567 --> 01:34:43.538
by virtue of his highly superior
brains, shall rule in my stead

1625
01:34:43.906 --> 01:34:48.343
assisted by the Tin Man, by
virtue of his magnificent heart

1626
01:34:48.710 --> 01:34:52.281
and The Lion, by virtue of his courage!

1627
01:34:52.722 --> 01:34:55.225
Obey them as you would me.

1628
01:34:55.284 --> 01:34:56.518
Thank you. Ruff!

1629
01:34:56.649 --> 01:34:57.315
Rrow!

1630
01:34:57.842 --> 01:34:58.426
Ruff!

1631
01:34:59.154 --> 01:35:00.122
Oh, Toto!

1632
01:35:00.188 --> 01:35:01.971
Come back! Toto! Toto!

1633
01:35:02.257 --> 01:35:04.493
Oh, don't go without me!
I'll be right back! Toto!

1634
01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:05.961
Stop that dog!

1635
01:35:06.028 --> 01:35:10.465
This is highly irregular procedure!
This is absolutely unprecedented!

1636
01:35:10.532 --> 01:35:11.719
Ruined my exit!

1637
01:35:11.722 --> 01:35:12.357
Oh!

1638
01:35:12.467 --> 01:35:14.136
Come back! Come back!

1639
01:35:14.269 --> 01:35:16.672
Don't go without me! Please, come back!

1640
01:35:16.957 --> 01:35:19.759
I can't come back! I don't know how it works!

1641
01:35:20.375 --> 01:35:21.643
Goodbye, folks!

1642
01:35:21.910 --> 01:35:22.978
Goodbye!

1643
01:35:22.981 --> 01:35:23.346
Bye!

1644
01:35:23.349 --> 01:35:23.789
Goodbye!

1645
01:35:27.449 --> 01:35:29.496
Oh, now I'll never get home!

1646
01:35:31.119 --> 01:35:32.955
Stay with us then, Dorothy.

1647
01:35:33.522 --> 01:35:34.890
We all love you.

1648
01:35:35.490 --> 01:35:37.459
We don't want you to go.

1649
01:35:38.060 --> 01:35:39.828
That's very kind of you

1650
01:35:40.529 --> 01:35:42.864
but this could never be like Kansas.

1651
01:35:43.899 --> 01:35:47.358
Auntie Em must have stopped wondering
what happened to me by now.

1652
01:35:48.340 --> 01:35:50.639
Oh, Scarecrow, what am I going to do?

1653
01:35:52.823 --> 01:35:53.790
Look!

1654
01:35:54.610 --> 01:35:56.645
Here's someone who can help you!

1655
01:36:29.841 --> 01:36:32.077
Oh, will you help me? Can you help me?

1656
01:36:32.309 --> 01:36:34.385
You don't need to be helped any longer.

1657
01:36:34.449 --> 01:36:37.452
You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.

1658
01:36:37.557 --> 01:36:38.720
I have?

1659
01:36:38.787 --> 01:36:40.522
Then why didn't you tell her before?

1660
01:36:40.589 --> 01:36:44.459
Because she wouldn't have believed me.
She had to learn it for herself.

1661
01:36:44.693 --> 01:36:46.762
What have you learned, Dorothy?

1662
01:36:47.302 --> 01:36:48.257
Well, I...

1663
01:36:50.599 --> 01:36:55.571
I think that it, that it wasn't enough just
to want to see Uncle Henry and Auntie Em.

1664
01:36:56.672 --> 01:37:00.776
And it's that if I ever go looking
for my heart's desire again,

1665
01:37:01.476 --> 01:37:04.213
I won't look any further than my own backyard

1666
01:37:05.047 --> 01:37:07.049
because if it isn't there.

1667
01:37:07.549 --> 01:37:09.952
I never really lost it to begin with.

1668
01:37:10.819 --> 01:37:12.054
Is that right?

1669
01:37:12.421 --> 01:37:14.022
That's all it is!

1670
01:37:14.089 --> 01:37:17.326
But that's so easy! I should
have thought of it for you.

1671
01:37:17.392 --> 01:37:19.024
I should have felt it in my heart.

1672
01:37:19.027 --> 01:37:21.232
No. She had to find it out for herself.

1673
01:37:21.296 --> 01:37:24.197
Now those magic slippers will
take you home in two seconds!

1674
01:37:24.700 --> 01:37:25.551
Oh, Toto, too?

1675
01:37:25.554 --> 01:37:26.670
Toto, too.

1676
01:37:26.952 --> 01:37:28.299
Oh, now?

1677
01:37:28.344 --> 01:37:29.669
Whenever you wish.

1678
01:37:29.871 --> 01:37:33.275
Oh, dear, that's too wonderful to be true!

1679
01:37:35.244 --> 01:37:38.914
It's going to be so hard to say goodbye.

1680
01:37:40.048 --> 01:37:41.516
I love you all, too.

1681
01:37:44.620 --> 01:37:45.988
Goodbye, Tin Man.

1682
01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:48.657
Oh, don't cry.

1683
01:37:49.391 --> 01:37:51.159
You'll rust so dreadfully.

1684
01:37:53.095 --> 01:37:55.130
Here. Here's your oil can.

1685
01:37:57.766 --> 01:37:58.767
Goodbye.

1686
01:37:58.867 --> 01:38:02.037
Now I know I've got a heart,
'cause it's breaking.

1687
01:38:06.074 --> 01:38:07.442
Goodbye, Lion.

1688
01:38:07.809 --> 01:38:09.711
You know, I know it isn't right

1689
01:38:09.778 --> 01:38:13.598
but I'm gonna miss the way
you used to holler for help

1690
01:38:13.615 --> 01:38:15.717
before you found your courage.

1691
01:38:16.318 --> 01:38:19.621
I would never've found it
if it hadn't been for you.

1692
01:38:25.078 --> 01:38:27.663
I think I'll miss you most of all.

1693
01:38:33.063 --> 01:38:34.464
Are you ready now?

1694
01:38:34.703 --> 01:38:35.737
Yes.

1695
01:38:37.873 --> 01:38:39.274
Say goodbye, Toto.

1696
01:38:42.711 --> 01:38:44.413
Yes, I'm ready now.

1697
01:38:44.680 --> 01:38:49.017
Then close your eyes and tap
your heels together three times.

1698
01:38:51.653 --> 01:38:53.388
And think to yourself:

1699
01:38:53.956 --> 01:38:59.394
"There's no place like home.
There's no place like home."

1700
01:39:00.599 --> 01:39:03.198
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.

1701
01:39:04.266 --> 01:39:06.768
There's no place like home.

1702
01:39:07.703 --> 01:39:10.205
There's no place like home.

1703
01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:13.742
There's no place like home.

1704
01:39:14.776 --> 01:39:16.778
There's no place like home.

1705
01:39:20.515 --> 01:39:22.517
There's no place like home.

1706
01:39:23.719 --> 01:39:25.721
There's no place like home.

1707
01:39:26.900 --> 01:39:27.909
There's no place...

1708
01:39:27.990 --> 01:39:29.024
Wake up, honey.

1709
01:39:29.091 --> 01:39:31.093
There's no place like home.

1710
01:39:31.994 --> 01:39:33.996
There's no place like home.

1711
01:39:36.393 --> 01:39:37.894
There's no place...

1712
01:39:40.897 --> 01:39:44.349
Dorothy! Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.

1713
01:39:44.673 --> 01:39:46.808
Auntie Em, it's you!

1714
01:39:46.847 --> 01:39:47.578
Yes darling.

1715
01:39:47.581 --> 01:39:49.511
Hello, there! Anybody home?

1716
01:39:49.611 --> 01:39:53.949
I, I just dropped by because I heard
the little girl got caught in the big...

1717
01:39:53.952 --> 01:39:56.485
Well, she seems all right now!

1718
01:39:56.717 --> 01:39:57.954
Yeah, she got quite a bump on the head.

1719
01:39:57.957 --> 01:40:00.623
We kinda' thought for a minute
she was gonna' leave us.

1720
01:40:00.689 --> 01:40:03.525
But I did leave you, Uncle Henry.
That's just the trouble.

1721
01:40:03.592 --> 01:40:05.794
And I tried to get back for days and days.

1722
01:40:05.861 --> 01:40:09.464
There, there, lie quiet now.
You just had a bad dream.

1723
01:40:09.865 --> 01:40:10.799
Sure.

1724
01:40:11.166 --> 01:40:14.069
Remember me, your old pal, Hunk?

1725
01:40:15.370 --> 01:40:17.406
And me, Hickory?

1726
01:40:18.040 --> 01:40:20.075
You couldn't forget my face, could you?

1727
01:40:20.142 --> 01:40:23.445
No. But it wasn't a dream. It was a place.

1728
01:40:23.946 --> 01:40:27.549
And you, and you, and you, and you were there.

1729
01:40:29.885 --> 01:40:31.887
But you couldn't have been, could you?

1730
01:40:31.953 --> 01:40:34.088
Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we...

1731
01:40:34.156 --> 01:40:37.626
No, Aunt Em, this was a real, truly live place.

1732
01:40:38.393 --> 01:40:41.296
And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice

1733
01:40:41.363 --> 01:40:44.499
but most of it was beautiful. But just the same

1734
01:40:44.633 --> 01:40:47.675
all I kept saying to everybody
was, "I want to go home!"

1735
01:40:47.678 --> 01:40:49.547
And they sent me home.

1736
01:40:51.707 --> 01:40:53.742
Doesn't anybody believe me?

1737
01:40:53.842 --> 01:40:55.811
Of course we believe you, Dorothy.

1738
01:40:55.878 --> 01:40:58.113
But anyway, Toto, we're home!

1739
01:40:58.447 --> 01:40:59.448
Home!

1740
01:40:59.815 --> 01:41:02.918
And this is my room, and you're all here!

1741
01:41:03.452 --> 01:41:08.398
And I'm not going to leave here ever,
ever again, because I love you all!

1742
01:41:08.722 --> 01:41:14.942
And, oh, Auntie Em, there's no place like home!
