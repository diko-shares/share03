1
00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.133
Oh, bollocks.

2
00:01:35.763 --> 00:01:36.806
We've got a problem.

3
00:01:36.931 --> 00:01:39.475
A cyber attack?
Yes, Prime Minister.

4
00:01:39.558 --> 00:01:42.478
Took me
two bottles of wine

5
00:01:42.561 --> 00:01:45.398
and half a packet of sleeping
pills to finally nod off.

6
00:01:45.523 --> 00:01:50.027
And you wake me because some fat-fingered
hacker's pinched your PIN number?

7
00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:51.862
Well, it's a little more serious
than that, Prime Minister.

8
00:01:51.946 --> 00:01:53.864
Hmm?
The identities of every one

9
00:01:53.948 --> 00:01:55.950
of our serving agents
have been exposed.

10
00:01:56.951 --> 00:01:57.994
What?

11
00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.121
Who's doing this?
We're not sure, ma'am.

12
00:02:00.246 --> 00:02:03.040
So one week before I host
my first G12 Summit,

13
00:02:03.124 --> 00:02:05.334
Britain's entire security
apparatus has been taken down

14
00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:06.836
and you know
absolutely nothing?

15
00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:09.672
That does pretty much sums up
the situation, ma'am, yes.

16
00:02:09.797 --> 00:02:11.674
Well, you better get someone
on it and find me some answers!

17
00:02:11.757 --> 00:02:13.968
Yes, but that's the problem.
We don't have any agents left.

18
00:02:14.051 --> 00:02:15.094
They've all been outed.

19
00:02:15.344 --> 00:02:17.596
So bring back an old one!

20
00:02:31.402 --> 00:02:35.489
All units, this is Juliet Echo.
Stand by for target coordinates.

21
00:02:37.992 --> 00:02:41.996
Target acquired.
Repeat, target acquired.

22
00:03:00.014 --> 00:03:02.808
Now then, what have we here?

23
00:03:05.102 --> 00:03:06.228
Sorry, sir.

24
00:03:06.395 --> 00:03:07.980
Never mind, Baggaley.

25
00:03:08.064 --> 00:03:11.108
Your concealment and camouflage
work is definitely improving.

26
00:03:11.233 --> 00:03:12.318
Thank you, sir.

27
00:03:12.526 --> 00:03:13.527
Come on.

28
00:03:13.611 --> 00:03:15.529
You, too, Ibadulla.

29
00:03:15.654 --> 00:03:18.824
Excellent. That is
a first-class man-trap.

30
00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:21.369
Yes!
Six house points.

31
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.331
Right, let's get back
to school before matron

32
00:03:25.414 --> 00:03:26.665
notices you're missing.

33
00:03:26.874 --> 00:03:29.418
And don't worry, there aren't
any more booby traps.

34
00:03:32.254 --> 00:03:34.590
Apart from this one,
of course.

35
00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:50.815
Mr. English?

36
00:03:51.107 --> 00:03:52.608
We haven't seen him, sir.

37
00:03:53.067 --> 00:03:54.193
Huh.

38
00:03:55.403 --> 00:03:58.239
And that's camouflage.

39
00:04:00.991 --> 00:04:02.159
Hmm.

40
00:04:06.497 --> 00:04:07.498
And go.

41
00:04:08.582 --> 00:04:09.667
And go.

42
00:04:10.501 --> 00:04:11.877
And go.

43
00:04:12.086 --> 00:04:15.005
The welfare of your children
is our paramount concern.

44
00:04:15.381 --> 00:04:17.383
They're never exposed
to any unnecessary risk,

45
00:04:17.466 --> 00:04:18.884
I assure you.

46
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.899
I think that's an "F" for your bomb
disposal coursework, Hattersley.

47
00:04:34.358 --> 00:04:37.027
"You're looking particularly
beautiful tonight."

48
00:04:37.153 --> 00:04:40.573
You're looking
particularly beautiful tonight.

49
00:04:40.865 --> 00:04:41.866
"Ching!"

50
00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:43.451
Ching!

51
00:04:45.536 --> 00:04:48.080
Have a good half-term, sir!
Thank you.

52
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.302
Are you seriously telling me
this is all we've got?

53
00:05:43.427 --> 00:05:44.762
Most of them are either dead,

54
00:05:44.845 --> 00:05:47.681
having hip operations or
recovering from prostate surgery.

55
00:05:49.767 --> 00:05:50.768
Okay.

56
00:05:51.393 --> 00:05:55.147
Before your briefing, we'll need
you to re-sign the Official Secrets Act.

57
00:05:55.272 --> 00:05:56.440
Thank you.

58
00:05:56.815 --> 00:05:57.858
Thank you.

59
00:05:57.942 --> 00:05:58.943
Thank you.

60
00:05:59.443 --> 00:06:00.945
Thank you very much.

61
00:06:01.362 --> 00:06:03.614
Any of you
gentlemen remember this?

62
00:06:04.073 --> 00:06:07.618
Ooh, the Mont Blanc Blaster.
Haven't seen one of those for years.

63
00:06:07.868 --> 00:06:12.540
Take the cap off and, if memory
serves, you've 20 seconds to replace it

64
00:06:12.665 --> 00:06:15.501
or it detonates with the force
of a stun grenade.

65
00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:37.314
Thank you.

66
00:06:39.984 --> 00:06:42.361
Teas on the left, gentlemen.

67
00:06:42.486 --> 00:06:44.446
And coffees on the right.

68
00:06:44.738 --> 00:06:45.948
Excellent.

69
00:06:46.073 --> 00:06:49.034
Oh, damn it,
I forgot my pills.

70
00:06:49.201 --> 00:06:51.328
Here, have some of mine.

71
00:06:52.913 --> 00:06:54.999
Scotch whisky, single malt?

72
00:06:55.124 --> 00:06:56.959
Thank you very much.

73
00:06:57.167 --> 00:06:59.169
Coffee.
Oh.

74
00:06:59.253 --> 00:07:01.505
Here, let me
help you with that.

75
00:07:06.802 --> 00:07:07.886
Tea?

76
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:16.145
Ooh, this one just needs
a little top-up of hot water.

77
00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.230
I'll be right back.

78
00:07:20.107 --> 00:07:22.359
Man's a divot
of the first order.

79
00:07:22.443 --> 00:07:24.778
Someone should put him
out of his misery.

80
00:07:24.903 --> 00:07:27.948
Along with whoever
furnished this room.

81
00:07:34.038 --> 00:07:35.205
Oh!

82
00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:39.501
Ah, good morning.
Sorry to keep you.

83
00:07:41.462 --> 00:07:43.213
Are the others here?

84
00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:44.757
Um...

85
00:07:45.841 --> 00:07:47.009
Oh.

86
00:07:51.305 --> 00:07:54.725
They, um... They nodded off.

87
00:07:55.267 --> 00:07:56.268
Right...

88
00:07:57.519 --> 00:07:58.812
And who are you exactly?

89
00:07:59.313 --> 00:08:00.397
English.

90
00:08:01.357 --> 00:08:03.067
- Johnny English.
- Well...

91
00:08:04.526 --> 00:08:06.028
"English..."

92
00:08:07.363 --> 00:08:08.822
You'll leave immediately.

93
00:08:08.906 --> 00:08:10.991
My people will give you
the full briefing en route.

94
00:08:11.075 --> 00:08:12.409
Oh, is there
anything you need?

95
00:08:12.493 --> 00:08:16.205
Yes, nerve gas nasal spray,
a type-four exoskeleton...

96
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.248
You should probably
start a list.

97
00:08:18.374 --> 00:08:21.794
And a garroting watch, with a
rubber strap, not the steel bracelet

98
00:08:21.919 --> 00:08:25.255
because the links get caught
in the little hairs on my wrist.

99
00:08:25.589 --> 00:08:27.675
Oh, and I'll also
need a Bough.

100
00:08:28.217 --> 00:08:29.718
What's a Bough?

101
00:08:31.095 --> 00:08:32.096
Sir!

102
00:08:34.181 --> 00:08:36.016
Wonderful to see you!

103
00:08:37.226 --> 00:08:39.937
Yes, all right, Bough. We're going
on a mission, not a honeymoon.

104
00:08:40.187 --> 00:08:41.772
Yes, of course, sir.

105
00:08:42.398 --> 00:08:45.442
Ah. I think it's the pin of your
buckle, sir. It's caught on my jumper.

106
00:08:45.526 --> 00:08:46.735
Yes, I can see
what's wrong, Bough.

107
00:08:46.902 --> 00:08:50.072
If you go to your left
and I'll go to my right.

108
00:08:51.448 --> 00:08:54.702
I'm sorry, no, if you go to
your right and I'll go to my left.

109
00:08:56.745 --> 00:09:00.290
No. If I go clockwise
and you go anti-clockwise...

110
00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:02.751
Er, no, I think that's
making it worse, sir.

111
00:09:02.835 --> 00:09:05.254
Hmm. I'm surprised
that didn't work.

112
00:09:10.509 --> 00:09:13.679
Good morning, sir. I have your
agent activation pack here.

113
00:09:14.221 --> 00:09:15.889
Department-issue smartphone.

114
00:09:15.973 --> 00:09:20.269
580-megapixel camera,
4.7-inch retina HD display.

115
00:09:20.352 --> 00:09:25.357
Hmm-hmm. Ingenious. And what
does it shoot? Poison darts?

116
00:09:25.983 --> 00:09:29.695
It doesn't shoot anything.
It's a phone.

117
00:09:30.279 --> 00:09:32.197
There's a Twitter handle,
Instagram feed

118
00:09:32.281 --> 00:09:34.283
and secure login for the
department Uber account.

119
00:09:34.366 --> 00:09:35.367
What's he on about, Bough?

120
00:09:35.451 --> 00:09:37.578
I need a weapon.
Not a box of gobbledygook.

121
00:09:37.786 --> 00:09:40.122
I think, uh,
what Agent English

122
00:09:40.205 --> 00:09:42.499
is getting at, sir, is all
this is highly trackable.

123
00:09:42.791 --> 00:09:46.170
But since we're dealing with a
very sophisticated, digital target,

124
00:09:46.253 --> 00:09:50.841
we might be less visible if we took
a more analog, low-tech approach.

125
00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:53.594
Exactly.

126
00:09:55.012 --> 00:09:56.346
I see.

127
00:09:56.889 --> 00:09:58.682
Is there anything else
I can get you?

128
00:09:59.099 --> 00:10:00.434
A gun.

129
00:10:01.977 --> 00:10:06.148
We don't really
do guns anymore.

130
00:10:06.523 --> 00:10:08.108
Just get him a gun.

131
00:10:08.525 --> 00:10:09.818
Right, a gun.

132
00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:19.536
Right. Haven't actually done
one of these before.

133
00:10:20.704 --> 00:10:22.831
"It is my obligation
under section 14

134
00:10:22.915 --> 00:10:24.708
"of the Health and Safety
Directive to inform you

135
00:10:24.792 --> 00:10:27.461
"that the equipment with which
you are about to be issued

136
00:10:27.544 --> 00:10:29.463
"can cause injury
and bodily harm.

137
00:10:33.383 --> 00:10:36.011
"Furthermore, any agents
with nut allergies

138
00:10:36.094 --> 00:10:37.221
"should be aware
that traces of cashew oil..."

139
00:10:37.304 --> 00:10:38.639
Thank you.

140
00:10:41.266 --> 00:10:42.684
Right, transport.

141
00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.524
So, take any hybrid you want.

142
00:11:04.414 --> 00:11:05.666
I'll take this one.

143
00:11:05.916 --> 00:11:08.961
Oh, don't be ridiculous,
English. This car is a relic.

144
00:11:09.044 --> 00:11:11.839
Drinks petrol, leaks oil
and has no passive,

145
00:11:11.922 --> 00:11:13.590
let alone
active safety features.

146
00:11:13.799 --> 00:11:15.217
Do you know what else
it doesn't have, sir?

147
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.053
Satellite navigation
or a single computer chip.

148
00:11:18.136 --> 00:11:21.390
Making it completely invisible
to a digital enemy.

149
00:11:23.392 --> 00:11:25.477
The equipment
Agent English requested, sir.

150
00:11:25.561 --> 00:11:26.770
Thank you.

151
00:11:27.896 --> 00:11:29.690
Phone, Bough?
Yeah.

152
00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:36.071
That hi-tech villain of yours
will never see us coming.

153
00:11:53.589 --> 00:11:55.424
Let's see
what they've given us.

154
00:11:56.133 --> 00:12:00.846
Exoskeleton, exploding cotton
buds, the old shoebox inflatable.

155
00:12:00.929 --> 00:12:02.139
Hmm.

156
00:12:03.098 --> 00:12:07.477
Ooh, what are these? Instant
Release Super High Energy Pills.

157
00:12:07.686 --> 00:12:11.815
Like sticking your fingers in an
electric socket. Highly recommended.

158
00:12:12.733 --> 00:12:15.861
Right, so, the red ones must be
the Total Knockout Sleeping Pills.

159
00:12:15.986 --> 00:12:17.070
Correct.

160
00:12:17.154 --> 00:12:19.448
Hmm. Probably worth
labeling these.

161
00:12:19.531 --> 00:12:20.574
Oh.

162
00:12:20.657 --> 00:12:23.076
Look, sir. Sweeties.

163
00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:25.162
Ooh.

164
00:12:25.704 --> 00:12:27.456
Hang on a minute.

165
00:12:27.581 --> 00:12:29.416
I always did love
a jelly baby.

166
00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:32.586
I wouldn't if I was you, Bough.
"Jelly" is short for gelignite.

167
00:12:32.669 --> 00:12:34.379
One bite and it'll take
the top of your head off

168
00:12:34.463 --> 00:12:36.131
along with
the roof of the car.

169
00:12:36.715 --> 00:12:38.467
So, what does this do?

170
00:12:39.718 --> 00:12:41.595
It's a mixtape, Bough.

171
00:12:46.016 --> 00:12:48.685
- So, destination?
- South of France, sir.

172
00:12:48.769 --> 00:12:50.771
That cyber attack
seems to have been launched

173
00:12:50.854 --> 00:12:53.315
from the Wi-Fi signal
of a hotel in Antibes.

174
00:13:38.068 --> 00:13:41.363
Sir? Sir, I've just had
a fax through from HQ.

175
00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:44.908
Background checks on all the
guests that accessed the Wi-Fi network.

176
00:13:44.992 --> 00:13:47.119
You see? Who needs email?

177
00:13:52.874 --> 00:13:54.126
Um...

178
00:13:54.209 --> 00:13:56.545
One name has raised
a red flag, sir.

179
00:13:57.337 --> 00:14:00.257
Sebastian Lynch, ex-Army
and Military Intelligence.

180
00:14:00.507 --> 00:14:03.343
Now selling his services
to the highest bidder.

181
00:14:03.635 --> 00:14:06.304
Where do we find him?
Directly ahead, sir.

182
00:14:07.973 --> 00:14:11.184
He's got an 8:00 reservation
at the Cote de Roc restaurant.

183
00:14:21.778 --> 00:14:24.990
The problem's going to be getting
close enough for a full surveillance, sir.

184
00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.159
Not necessarily.

185
00:14:43.967 --> 00:14:47.054
Oh, darling, I've
just gotta get this. Two seconds.

186
00:14:47.637 --> 00:14:51.975
Simple plan, two parts. You provide
the distraction, I'll get the phone.

187
00:14:52.059 --> 00:14:54.394
Yes, sir.
And from now on,

188
00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:59.733
perhaps
we should sound like French waiters.

189
00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:03.278
French waiters?

190
00:15:04.154 --> 00:15:05.405
Yees.

191
00:15:06.948 --> 00:15:08.116
Go on.

192
00:15:13.872 --> 00:15:15.916
Are you finished now,
Sebastian?

193
00:15:17.209 --> 00:15:18.710
Bread roll?

194
00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.045
Yes, thank you.

195
00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.380
Excellent choice,
<i>madame.</i>

196
00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.258
Good evening.

197
00:15:25.842 --> 00:15:27.427
How are you?

198
00:15:29.221 --> 00:15:30.722
Bread roll, sir?

199
00:15:30.847 --> 00:15:32.265
Yes. Thank you.

200
00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:38.563
One second.

201
00:15:38.855 --> 00:15:40.774
Excuse me,
would you mind?

202
00:15:41.608 --> 00:15:43.819
Oh, yes. Evening.

203
00:15:44.402 --> 00:15:45.487
Evening.

204
00:15:59.835 --> 00:16:01.169
Thank you.

205
00:16:15.433 --> 00:16:16.601
Where's my phone?

206
00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:19.646
That is your phone.

207
00:16:21.731 --> 00:16:23.567
Ooh.

208
00:16:28.238 --> 00:16:29.239
Thank you.

209
00:16:30.532 --> 00:16:31.575
<i>Monsieur.</i>

210
00:16:32.742 --> 00:16:36.037
The, uh, shell on my wife's
lobster, could you remove it, please?

211
00:16:38.248 --> 00:16:39.416
Yees.

212
00:16:40.208 --> 00:16:42.127
Uh...
Um...

213
00:16:42.377 --> 00:16:43.545
Hmm.

214
00:16:47.549 --> 00:16:49.843
Let me crack it for you.

215
00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:05.025
Oh!

216
00:17:05.817 --> 00:17:06.985
Ow!

217
00:17:38.433 --> 00:17:39.601
Hello?

218
00:17:42.687 --> 00:17:44.981
Steve, I'll have
to call you back. Call you back.

219
00:17:47.234 --> 00:17:48.485
Give me a sec. Hang on.

220
00:17:49.903 --> 00:17:51.446
What is going on?

221
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:56.993
Sebastian,
don't get involved.

222
00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:01.665
Ah.

223
00:18:05.877 --> 00:18:08.338
- What is he doing?
- I don't know. He's a fool.

224
00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:11.007
There we are.

225
00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:14.469
<i>Voilà.</i>

226
00:18:21.851 --> 00:18:24.104
Hmm. Bon appétit.

227
00:18:27.232 --> 00:18:30.360
I will talk to the manager.
I will talk to the manager.

228
00:18:39.536 --> 00:18:41.621
Textbook, Bough.

229
00:18:46.084 --> 00:18:47.919
Just
holiday snaps, sir.

230
00:18:49.129 --> 00:18:51.047
Wait a minute, this photo.

231
00:18:51.298 --> 00:18:55.135
It was taken the same day our
villain accessed the Wi-Fi, and look.

232
00:18:55.802 --> 00:18:57.762
Scarcely 50 feet from shore.

233
00:18:59.556 --> 00:19:00.932
Whoever was on that yacht

234
00:19:01.016 --> 00:19:03.768
could easily have used
the hotel's Wi-Fi,

235
00:19:03.852 --> 00:19:07.022
sent that signal
and then just sailed away.

236
00:19:07.564 --> 00:19:12.235
I think it's time
we paid the <i>Dot Calm</i> a visit.

237
00:19:24.956 --> 00:19:25.957
<i>Algorithms.</i>

238
00:19:26.041 --> 00:19:28.251
<i>We are surrounded by them.</i>

239
00:19:28.335 --> 00:19:30.503
<i>Algorithms run our lives,</i>

240
00:19:30.587 --> 00:19:35.050
<i>choose our TV shows, stream
our music. Even find us a date.</i>

241
00:19:37.093 --> 00:19:38.845
I know this chap, don't I?

242
00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:42.223
Yes, he's that Silicon Valley
billionaire who dated a Kardashian.

243
00:19:42.307 --> 00:19:45.018
Two Kardashians and a
Black-Eyed Pea. Keep watching.

244
00:19:45.185 --> 00:19:48.438
<i>But supposing there was an
algorithm for an entire country.</i>

245
00:19:48.521 --> 00:19:52.108
<i>A single algorithm that could be
applied to every one of its problems.</i>

246
00:19:52.359 --> 00:19:56.529
<i>A single algorithm that could take
a second-rate nation and make it</i>

247
00:19:57.072 --> 00:19:58.948
<i>world class.</i>

248
00:20:00.283 --> 00:20:02.702
<i>Every nation
is awash with data.</i>

249
00:20:03.411 --> 00:20:08.041
So now, more than ever, we need
to put that data to work for the people.

250
00:20:08.541 --> 00:20:11.419
These few lines of code
will deliver the kind of change

251
00:20:11.544 --> 00:20:14.297
they have been dreaming of
their entire lives.

252
00:20:14.422 --> 00:20:17.467
<i>I am Xander. I love data.</i>

253
00:20:20.678 --> 00:20:22.430
He's so clever.

254
00:20:22.555 --> 00:20:25.475
He's young, he's sexy,
he's insanely successful.

255
00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:28.561
Just the qualities we need
people to associate with me.

256
00:20:29.896 --> 00:20:30.939
Yes, Prime Minister.

257
00:20:31.064 --> 00:20:33.566
And they will do when
he starts working with us.

258
00:20:33.691 --> 00:20:36.277
But why would a Silicon Valley
billionaire work with us?

259
00:20:36.403 --> 00:20:39.114
Just get him into Number 10
and let me work on him.

260
00:20:39.197 --> 00:20:40.615
Yes, ma'am.
Go on.

261
00:20:43.535 --> 00:20:44.786
Oh, God, now what?

262
00:20:45.328 --> 00:20:46.830
There's been another attack,
Prime Minister.

263
00:20:46.913 --> 00:20:48.248
Oh!
Air Traffic Control.

264
00:20:48.915 --> 00:20:51.793
Someone's rerouted every
flight in Europe to Luton.

265
00:20:51.918 --> 00:20:54.003
For God's sake, tell me the
agent you've got in the field

266
00:20:54.129 --> 00:20:55.839
is making some progress?

267
00:21:05.306 --> 00:21:08.309
So, how are we gonna
find the location of that yacht, sir?

268
00:21:08.435 --> 00:21:11.771
Very easily, Bough.
We ring MI7.

269
00:21:16.025 --> 00:21:19.362
Hello, hello? Yes, I need
the location of a boat called...

270
00:21:23.658 --> 00:21:26.828
Hello? Hello, yes.
A boat called the Dot Calm.

271
00:21:27.537 --> 00:21:29.706
Yes, it's a play
on words. Yeah.

272
00:21:30.039 --> 00:21:31.040
Where?

273
00:21:37.881 --> 00:21:39.716
Looks about
half a mile out, sir.

274
00:21:40.758 --> 00:21:43.011
Do we wanna try
and swim it or...

275
00:21:43.136 --> 00:21:46.556
No, Bough. This is a job
for the shoebox inflatable.

276
00:21:46.681 --> 00:21:48.308
No, don't open it
in the car, sir!

277
00:21:54.814 --> 00:21:57.817
Can you reach
your door handle?

278
00:22:00.236 --> 00:22:01.821
No, sir.

279
00:22:02.322 --> 00:22:04.657
I'll try my side.

280
00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:26.054
Right, Bough, our aim is to get
on board without anyone noticing.

281
00:22:26.596 --> 00:22:28.264
And how are we gonna do it?

282
00:22:28.473 --> 00:22:30.850
Magnetic boots.
Brilliant, sir.

283
00:22:31.726 --> 00:22:33.144
Simple mechanism.

284
00:22:33.269 --> 00:22:36.397
Left switch activates left boot.
Right switch activates right.

285
00:22:37.106 --> 00:22:38.942
Okay, let's go.

286
00:22:53.831 --> 00:22:59.337
Remember, the absolutely vital
element of this mission is surprise.

287
00:23:21.025 --> 00:23:22.777
Now, you have to get up
pretty early in the morning

288
00:23:22.902 --> 00:23:25.029
to outwit
British Intelligence.

289
00:23:31.202 --> 00:23:32.287
Quick!

290
00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:41.296
Good evening, gentlemen.

291
00:23:42.589 --> 00:23:44.591
Shall we start
with your names?

292
00:23:45.717 --> 00:23:48.678
Clearly you have no idea
who you're dealing with.

293
00:23:49.679 --> 00:23:52.015
That's why I'm starting
with your names.

294
00:23:52.557 --> 00:23:54.434
Actually, would you mind
coming down here?

295
00:23:54.559 --> 00:23:57.228
It's really hard to have
a conversation like this.

296
00:23:58.605 --> 00:24:00.273
I have a better idea.

297
00:24:07.947 --> 00:24:09.657
It's no good,
it won't move, sir.

298
00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:12.368
We'll see about that.

299
00:24:12.493 --> 00:24:14.829
Low-intensity
exploding cotton bud.

300
00:24:18.666 --> 00:24:21.210
That's quite a powerful charge
for such a small space, sir.

301
00:24:21.294 --> 00:24:22.712
Oh, nonsense.

302
00:24:24.964 --> 00:24:27.133
There will just be
a slight pop.

303
00:24:35.141 --> 00:24:38.061
Shall we locate the hold
and look for the source of that signal?

304
00:24:38.144 --> 00:24:42.148
I think we should locate the hold
and look for the source of that signal!

305
00:24:45.485 --> 00:24:46.653
Come on!

306
00:24:58.539 --> 00:25:01.042
I'd say we have
our villain, Bough!

307
00:25:01.167 --> 00:25:03.336
You need to keep
your voice down, sir.

308
00:25:04.212 --> 00:25:06.214
And we're not going
to lose him.

309
00:25:19.727 --> 00:25:21.979
Hand me the sherbet fountain.

310
00:25:24.482 --> 00:25:27.485
Three sucks and the location
transmitter is activated.

311
00:25:27.568 --> 00:25:31.364
This gin palace will show up
as a hostile from 30,000 feet.

312
00:25:31.906 --> 00:25:32.949
Hmm.

313
00:25:39.831 --> 00:25:42.667
This is now an enemy target.

314
00:25:48.089 --> 00:25:49.757
Aniseed balls.

315
00:26:04.856 --> 00:26:08.109
If you'd wanted to kill me, you
would have already done so.

316
00:26:11.529 --> 00:26:13.364
Till we meet again.

317
00:26:21.497 --> 00:26:22.665
Ow!

318
00:26:27.253 --> 00:26:29.547
Well, that was sooner
than I expected.

319
00:26:33.384 --> 00:26:36.471
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

320
00:26:40.016 --> 00:26:41.893
<i>Who do you
think she is, sir?</i>

321
00:26:41.976 --> 00:26:44.645
Well, if she's not
the owner of that yacht,

322
00:26:44.729 --> 00:26:46.189
then she knows who is.

323
00:26:47.315 --> 00:26:49.817
Either way, she's the key
to this case.

324
00:26:52.153 --> 00:26:55.198
Is it true you were teaching,
sir? Before all this blew up?

325
00:26:56.491 --> 00:26:58.743
If by "teaching" you mean

326
00:26:58.868 --> 00:27:03.831
scouting for potential intelligence
operatives then yes, I was.

327
00:27:03.915 --> 00:27:04.999
Hmm.

328
00:27:05.082 --> 00:27:09.754
I actually got married, sir.
I don't know if you heard.

329
00:27:11.339 --> 00:27:12.340
No.

330
00:27:13.007 --> 00:27:14.342
Hmm.

331
00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:16.135
Yeah, Lydia.

332
00:27:16.219 --> 00:27:17.261
Lovely girl.

333
00:27:21.015 --> 00:27:23.684
You never think about getting
hitched yourself, sir?

334
00:27:24.936 --> 00:27:29.440
This is no life for a married man,
Bough. The danger, the constant travel.

335
00:27:29.524 --> 00:27:30.608
Here you go, sir.

336
00:27:30.691 --> 00:27:32.693
More Lydia's life
than mine, sir.

337
00:27:34.153 --> 00:27:35.446
She's in the Navy, you see.

338
00:27:36.405 --> 00:27:37.573
What, as a cook?

339
00:27:38.407 --> 00:27:41.619
Or some kind of seagoing
secretary or...

340
00:27:41.702 --> 00:27:44.580
Oh, no, sir. She's the captain
of a nuclear submarine.

341
00:27:45.915 --> 00:27:47.250
Oh, right.
Hmm.

342
00:27:49.669 --> 00:27:52.421
Do you think we should get
some petrol for the Aston, sir?

343
00:27:53.881 --> 00:27:58.135
No. An Aston Martin is
surprisingly economical, Bough.

344
00:28:00.179 --> 00:28:03.182
Besides, it looks like
we're in business.

345
00:28:17.238 --> 00:28:18.406
Come on.

346
00:28:25.621 --> 00:28:27.582
Looks like
an electric car, sir.

347
00:28:27.665 --> 00:28:30.126
Yes, and sounds like
a nose hair trimmer.

348
00:28:32.253 --> 00:28:33.838
A bunch
of triple-A batteries

349
00:28:33.921 --> 00:28:36.549
is no match for old-fashioned
British horsepower.

350
00:28:58.070 --> 00:29:01.449
Look at her cornering. Seems
so effortless, doesn't it, sir?

351
00:29:40.821 --> 00:29:42.406
Arm the missile.

352
00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:43.616
The what?

353
00:29:43.699 --> 00:29:45.952
The missile, Bough, the one
with the tear gas warhead.

354
00:29:46.035 --> 00:29:48.579
But they're just cyclists,
sir. We'll get past in a minute.

355
00:29:48.663 --> 00:29:49.830
They're French cyclists,
Bough,

356
00:29:49.956 --> 00:29:52.667
and they're obstructing
Her Majesty's Secret Service.

357
00:30:00.508 --> 00:30:01.842
Wiper stalk
is armed, sir.

358
00:30:11.143 --> 00:30:12.144
<i>Sorry.</i>

359
00:30:12.603 --> 00:30:14.897
<i>Terribly sorry.
We do apologize.</i>

360
00:30:15.022 --> 00:30:17.191
<i>Stop it, Bough,
you'll only encourage them.</i>

361
00:30:32.707 --> 00:30:35.376
What are we gonna do now, sir?
Patience, Bough.

362
00:30:35.918 --> 00:30:38.838
Driving like that, her battery
will be dead any moment.

363
00:30:38.963 --> 00:30:42.216
And she'll roll
to a humiliating stop.

364
00:31:01.485 --> 00:31:05.072
Bough, it is your job to keep
an eye on the fuel gauge.

365
00:31:12.747 --> 00:31:14.915
Very impressive driving, Mr...

366
00:31:16.625 --> 00:31:17.710
Golightly.

367
00:31:18.753 --> 00:31:20.880
Basil Golightly.

368
00:31:23.257 --> 00:31:25.885
And you're rather useful
yourself, Miss...

369
00:31:26.552 --> 00:31:29.597
Bhuletova. Ophelia Bhuletova.

370
00:31:29.764 --> 00:31:31.015
Hmm.

371
00:31:31.098 --> 00:31:32.850
And this is...

372
00:31:33.225 --> 00:31:34.226
Colin.

373
00:31:35.853 --> 00:31:38.022
I thought we were
using fake names.

374
00:31:38.939 --> 00:31:40.691
That is a fake name.

375
00:31:43.527 --> 00:31:44.862
Oh, right.

376
00:31:46.864 --> 00:31:48.741
Yes, this is Colin,

377
00:31:49.992 --> 00:31:51.118
and I'm...

378
00:31:55.289 --> 00:31:56.415
"Dasil."

379
00:31:56.874 --> 00:31:57.875
Dasil.

380
00:31:58.292 --> 00:31:59.293
Basil.

381
00:32:00.544 --> 00:32:02.755
Well, Basil,

382
00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:04.965
maybe there is a simpler way
of doing this.

383
00:32:05.758 --> 00:32:07.176
Over a drink perhaps?

384
00:32:07.259 --> 00:32:09.637
Well, that would be lovely.

385
00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:14.391
Shall we say the bar at the Hotel
de Paris in Cagnes-sur-Mer? 8:00?

386
00:32:14.475 --> 00:32:16.560
Mmm. It's a date.

387
00:32:21.941 --> 00:32:22.942
Well,

388
00:32:23.526 --> 00:32:27.696
I think my "running out of
fuel" ruse worked pretty well.

389
00:32:28.114 --> 00:32:29.323
Mmm.

390
00:32:33.077 --> 00:32:34.161
What?

391
00:32:34.328 --> 00:32:36.705
Er, junior doctors. They've
confirmed they are going on strike

392
00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:38.582
and the tube drivers
are coming out in support.

393
00:32:38.666 --> 00:32:41.502
Oh, God. Leader of the Opposition,
has he come round from his heart surgery?

394
00:32:41.585 --> 00:32:42.628
Yes, Prime Minister.

395
00:32:42.711 --> 00:32:45.840
Oh, Jesus Christ, when will something
go right for me? What do you want?

396
00:32:46.632 --> 00:32:48.676
They've hit us again,
Prime Minister.

397
00:32:49.218 --> 00:32:51.720
Huh? Hacked into the
Central Traffic Control System.

398
00:32:52.012 --> 00:32:55.432
Yes, they've turned every
traffic light in London to red.

399
00:32:58.060 --> 00:32:59.687
Where's my bloody drink?

400
00:33:00.437 --> 00:33:02.815
You've got to be joking?
Vodka tonic, no ice, no tonic.

401
00:33:02.898 --> 00:33:05.442
Yes, ma'am. Oh, and
Mr. Volta has arrived, ma'am.

402
00:33:09.947 --> 00:33:12.575
Mr. Volta,
welcome to Downing Street.

403
00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:15.786
I have read so much
about this wonderful building.

404
00:33:15.911 --> 00:33:19.415
Is this the stone triple staircase
designed by William Kent?

405
00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:22.710
Um, yes, it probably is.
I can't swear to it.

406
00:33:22.835 --> 00:33:25.379
- Can we do a quick...
<i>- Needs Photoshop.</i>

407
00:33:25.462 --> 00:33:27.965
Oh!
This way. Hmm.

408
00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:29.884
I am horribly late,
I do apologize.

409
00:33:30.009 --> 00:33:32.803
It's the traffic, it's the one
thing I don't love about London.

410
00:33:32.928 --> 00:33:35.347
Yes, well, I must admit
we are having a slight problem

411
00:33:35.431 --> 00:33:37.349
with the lights at the moment.
Nothing major.

412
00:33:37.474 --> 00:33:40.477
If you wanted, I could take a
look? It is kind of what I do.

413
00:33:40.561 --> 00:33:43.189
I think it's actually a little
bit more complex than...

414
00:33:43.314 --> 00:33:46.692
Xander, get a web address for
London's traffic control center.

415
00:33:47.359 --> 00:33:51.071
<i>Here is the login page,
Jason. Do you have a password?</i>

416
00:33:53.532 --> 00:33:54.700
Um...

417
00:33:57.828 --> 00:34:00.664
I won't tell if you won't.
Right you are.

418
00:34:01.957 --> 00:34:05.586
<i>Bypassing security.
Security bypassed.</i>

419
00:34:05.669 --> 00:34:06.670
Oh, that's terrific.

420
00:34:08.047 --> 00:34:11.217
Someone is hacking you.
Oh, I don't think so.

421
00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:15.387
Denied service attack.
Yeah, primitive but effective.

422
00:34:16.513 --> 00:34:19.892
You know what we could try,
rerouting all service requests

423
00:34:19.975 --> 00:34:22.102
to our server farm in Nevada.

424
00:34:23.103 --> 00:34:24.396
Um...
I...

425
00:34:25.648 --> 00:34:27.399
<i>Rerouting, Jason.</i>

426
00:34:27.483 --> 00:34:29.235
<i>Rerouting complete.</i>

427
00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:35.282
Crikey.

428
00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:39.912
So, what was it you wanted
to talk to me about?

429
00:34:40.246 --> 00:34:42.373
You, Jason.

430
00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:44.875
Get out.

431
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.543
I want to talk about you.

432
00:35:01.016 --> 00:35:03.894
Excellent, Bough.
Nearly there.

433
00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:06.230
Nearly there.

434
00:35:06.355 --> 00:35:09.358
This is actually
a really nice hotel, Bough.

435
00:35:10.109 --> 00:35:12.987
I'm turning to the right.

436
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.962
Shall one of us keep Miss Bhuletova busy
while the other searches her room, sir?

437
00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:34.174
Good idea, Bough.
Alert me if you find anything.

438
00:35:56.322 --> 00:35:57.489
Mr. Golightly.

439
00:36:00.492 --> 00:36:01.493
Oh...

440
00:36:02.161 --> 00:36:03.203
Indeed.

441
00:36:04.204 --> 00:36:07.291
I thought perhaps you weren't
coming. On the contrary.

442
00:36:07.458 --> 00:36:10.085
Wild horses couldn't
keep me away.

443
00:36:10.836 --> 00:36:11.962
<i>Madame? Monsieur?</i>

444
00:36:12.504 --> 00:36:14.423
Evening. What would you like?

445
00:36:15.132 --> 00:36:18.761
I'm feeling a little homesick
tonight. I'll have a Moscow Mule.

446
00:36:22.306 --> 00:36:24.641
And I'll have a London...

447
00:36:24.975 --> 00:36:26.977
Lemming, please.

448
00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:30.356
I'm not sure, what...

449
00:36:31.648 --> 00:36:34.985
It's, uh, gin, vodka,

450
00:36:36.445 --> 00:36:37.780
armagnac,

451
00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:39.823
sherry,

452
00:36:40.491 --> 00:36:42.993
with just a little bit
of Parmesan.

453
00:36:49.166 --> 00:36:52.878
So, what brings you to
the South of France, Miss...

454
00:36:52.961 --> 00:36:54.380
Bhilli... Bholly...

455
00:36:54.463 --> 00:36:55.672
Bhuletova.

456
00:36:56.173 --> 00:36:57.549
Bhuletova.

457
00:36:57.883 --> 00:36:59.676
I'm just visiting
a friend of mine.

458
00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:00.886
Hmm.

459
00:37:03.931 --> 00:37:07.184
And would this friend
be the owner of the <i>Dot Calm?</i>

460
00:37:08.352 --> 00:37:09.436
Hmm.

461
00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:10.729
Yes, he would.

462
00:37:16.527 --> 00:37:18.362
And what about you,

463
00:37:18.445 --> 00:37:19.446
Basil?

464
00:37:19.613 --> 00:37:21.949
Oh, I'm just here
on business.

465
00:37:22.199 --> 00:37:25.202
Although, it's rapidly
turning into pleasure.

466
00:37:29.289 --> 00:37:31.041
Ooh! I love these.

467
00:37:36.255 --> 00:37:37.464
They're really hot.

468
00:37:46.515 --> 00:37:48.183
Are you all right?

469
00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:49.935
Yes, fine.

470
00:37:58.986 --> 00:38:00.028
Hmm.

471
00:38:06.493 --> 00:38:07.578
Cheers.

472
00:38:08.036 --> 00:38:11.206
I'm not sure I've ever met
a man quite like you, Basil.

473
00:38:12.207 --> 00:38:14.543
Let me clear up
the uncertainty for you.

474
00:38:15.169 --> 00:38:16.545
You haven't.

475
00:38:30.767 --> 00:38:35.189
I'm sorry, Basil. I have to get
up really early tomorrow morning.

476
00:38:35.564 --> 00:38:37.107
Oh, that's a shame.

477
00:38:47.659 --> 00:38:49.328
How did you get on, sir?

478
00:38:49.453 --> 00:38:52.122
Oh, gosh, what a wonderful
woman, Bough. Wonderful.

479
00:38:52.247 --> 00:38:53.248
Right.

480
00:38:53.373 --> 00:38:55.250
Charming. Intelligent.

481
00:38:55.334 --> 00:38:59.046
Lovely sense of humor. And
obviously entirely innocent.

482
00:38:59.171 --> 00:39:02.299
Although, I broke into her room and
she does have three passports, sir.

483
00:39:02.382 --> 00:39:05.219
Romanian, Bulgarian, Russian.
Different name in each.

484
00:39:05.844 --> 00:39:08.222
So she's been married
to three different people.

485
00:39:08.347 --> 00:39:10.349
Not unusual in this day
and age, Bough.

486
00:39:10.474 --> 00:39:13.352
And I also found some garroting
wire and two boxes of ammunition.

487
00:39:13.435 --> 00:39:18.273
Well, single woman, traveling
alone, you can't be too careful.

488
00:39:19.441 --> 00:39:22.402
You don't think
she might be a spy, sir?

489
00:39:22.861 --> 00:39:24.780
A spy?

490
00:39:25.531 --> 00:39:28.283
I think I know
what a spy looks like, Bough.

491
00:40:14.413 --> 00:40:15.747
Oh.

492
00:42:29.089 --> 00:42:30.382
Oh!

493
00:42:59.119 --> 00:43:00.245
Ah.

494
00:43:25.729 --> 00:43:26.730
Sir?

495
00:43:27.022 --> 00:43:28.023
Sir!

496
00:43:29.357 --> 00:43:31.359
I just got off the phone
to P in London.

497
00:43:31.443 --> 00:43:32.944
He's found out who the
owner of that yacht is.

498
00:43:33.028 --> 00:43:34.029
Jason Volta.

499
00:43:34.112 --> 00:43:36.323
The world's most powerful
Internet billionaire, sir!

500
00:43:36.406 --> 00:43:37.783
And he's in London,
right now.

501
00:43:37.866 --> 00:43:41.286
The Prime Minister is personally
negotiating a trade deal with him.

502
00:43:42.287 --> 00:43:43.872
Well, what are we waiting for?

503
00:44:15.111 --> 00:44:17.948
Do you think we might
slow down a little, sir?

504
00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:19.825
What?

505
00:44:21.993 --> 00:44:23.411
Never mind!

506
00:44:29.209 --> 00:44:31.461
<i>With what
appears to be another cyber attack,</i>

507
00:44:31.545 --> 00:44:32.838
<i>pressure is mounting
on the Prime Minister.</i>

508
00:44:32.963 --> 00:44:34.923
Every train in England?
Yes, sir.

509
00:44:35.006 --> 00:44:38.093
They're all trying to terminate
at Bristol Temple Meads.

510
00:44:41.304 --> 00:44:42.347
Morning, sir!

511
00:44:42.430 --> 00:44:44.516
You see this, English?
Yes!

512
00:44:45.433 --> 00:44:46.434
Please.

513
00:44:47.227 --> 00:44:48.562
Ooh!

514
00:44:49.145 --> 00:44:51.606
Tell me you've got something I
can take to the Prime Minister.

515
00:44:51.690 --> 00:44:54.693
Would the name of the man
responsible do, sir?

516
00:44:55.026 --> 00:44:56.611
Excellent, English, yes.

517
00:44:57.237 --> 00:44:59.531
It's Jason...

518
00:45:09.708 --> 00:45:12.168
Volta, sir. Jason Volta.

519
00:45:12.586 --> 00:45:13.587
What?

520
00:45:13.753 --> 00:45:16.339
You're accusing the PM's
knight in shining armor?

521
00:45:16.423 --> 00:45:18.258
I'd need hard evidence.

522
00:45:25.390 --> 00:45:26.725
Which...

523
00:45:27.475 --> 00:45:29.978
...is why Agent English
is proposing

524
00:45:30.061 --> 00:45:32.606
a penetration of Volta's
country estate in Surrey.

525
00:45:32.814 --> 00:45:37.068
Yes, yes, yes, yes...

526
00:45:37.152 --> 00:45:39.487
Well, do what you have
to do, English.

527
00:45:39.863 --> 00:45:41.865
But for God's sake,
be discreet about it.

528
00:45:42.073 --> 00:45:44.117
Oh! Oh.

529
00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:45.243
Good.

530
00:45:45.327 --> 00:45:46.411
Oh. Oh.

531
00:45:52.667 --> 00:45:54.377
"Virtual reality"?

532
00:45:54.502 --> 00:45:55.503
That's right, sir.

533
00:45:55.587 --> 00:45:57.923
P's built a computer model of
the inside of Volta's mansion.

534
00:45:58.006 --> 00:46:02.969
When you put on this headset, it will look
and feel as if you are inside the house.

535
00:46:03.053 --> 00:46:06.514
You'll be able to open and close
doors, walk up and down staircases,

536
00:46:06.598 --> 00:46:09.392
completely familiarize
yourself with its layout.

537
00:46:09.476 --> 00:46:12.729
This floor moves in any
direction. So you can walk...

538
00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:17.400
You can walk as far as
you want in the virtual world

539
00:46:18.151 --> 00:46:20.612
without ever actually
leaving this room.

540
00:46:20.987 --> 00:46:22.030
One thing though, sir.

541
00:46:23.239 --> 00:46:24.950
The experience can be
very disorientating.

542
00:46:25.033 --> 00:46:26.242
It's completely immersive

543
00:46:26.326 --> 00:46:29.371
and some people lose all track
of their actual surroundings.

544
00:46:29.454 --> 00:46:32.666
I think we can pretty much
guarantee that's not gonna happen.

545
00:46:32.999 --> 00:46:35.335
I'll just need you to sign the
health and safety releases.

546
00:46:35.669 --> 00:46:38.380
Would you excuse
me while I find an iPad.

547
00:46:39.381 --> 00:46:42.676
Oh, go with him, Bough. If we don't
chivvy him along we'll be here all day.

548
00:46:48.723 --> 00:46:49.975
Hmm.

549
00:47:10.161 --> 00:47:11.329
Ah.

550
00:47:33.393 --> 00:47:34.394
Watch out!

551
00:48:02.672 --> 00:48:04.466
<i>Door closing.</i>

552
00:48:05.091 --> 00:48:06.426
<i>Going down.</i>

553
00:49:07.153 --> 00:49:08.321
Hey!

554
00:49:23.795 --> 00:49:25.380
I'm sorry, sir, but you're
going to have to leave.

555
00:49:25.713 --> 00:49:26.756
Ow.

556
00:49:27.048 --> 00:49:28.091
Ow.

557
00:49:51.739 --> 00:49:54.868
So, we'll shortly
be arriving at Admiralty House.

558
00:49:54.993 --> 00:49:58.913
And, er, that actually used to be
Oliver Cromwell's own house. Um...

559
00:50:00.707 --> 00:50:02.041
Uh...

560
00:50:02.167 --> 00:50:05.670
And then we'll be going
to Horse Guards Parade.

561
00:50:08.423 --> 00:50:10.216
Perhaps you'd like
to sit down, sir?

562
00:50:12.969 --> 00:50:14.846
Hey, whoa!

563
00:50:19.475 --> 00:50:20.894
I've got them!

564
00:50:25.565 --> 00:50:29.527
However, the agent we have on this mission
is confident he's making major progress.

565
00:50:29.611 --> 00:50:32.405
And, uh, yes, we have a potential
suspect, he's been identified.

566
00:50:32.906 --> 00:50:36.910
And further covert
investigations are now ongoing.

567
00:50:38.203 --> 00:50:39.412
Yes, quite.

568
00:50:39.662 --> 00:50:42.582
So I expect to have more
to announce on this front

569
00:50:44.334 --> 00:50:45.501
shortly.

570
00:50:59.390 --> 00:51:00.558
Oh.

571
00:51:01.434 --> 00:51:02.435
Sir?

572
00:51:02.518 --> 00:51:03.645
Mmm?

573
00:51:03.728 --> 00:51:06.564
Is everything all right, sir?
Yes, I've done it, Bough.

574
00:51:06.814 --> 00:51:09.567
Child's play. Don't know what
all the fuss was about.

575
00:51:23.164 --> 00:51:25.166
<i>Pleasure to see you again,
Prime Minister.</i>

576
00:51:26.793 --> 00:51:29.712
It's a hologram.
Apparently you just speak to it normally.

577
00:51:31.381 --> 00:51:33.549
The pleasure's all mine.

578
00:51:33.633 --> 00:51:37.512
Hate to rush you, but was there
something in particular you needed?

579
00:51:37.595 --> 00:51:40.265
Actually, I was just calling
really to see

580
00:51:40.348 --> 00:51:44.394
if you had had a chance
to think things over.

581
00:51:44.644 --> 00:51:45.645
<i>I have.</i>

582
00:51:48.147 --> 00:51:51.734
But the thing is, Fiona, I just don't
really do other people's security.

583
00:51:51.818 --> 00:51:55.196
<i>Not that I don't want to.
But your infrastructure is old.</i>

584
00:51:55.530 --> 00:51:57.198
Plus the only way I could keep
you secure in the meantime

585
00:51:57.282 --> 00:52:00.827
would be by storing all your
data on my own servers.

586
00:52:00.910 --> 00:52:03.037
<i>Obviously, that would be...</i>
Yes. Jason,

587
00:52:03.121 --> 00:52:07.083
what I really want to do is announce
this tie-up at the G12 meeting.

588
00:52:07.959 --> 00:52:10.295
<i>Do we have a deal?</i>

589
00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:21.139
Good luck, sir.

590
00:52:39.824 --> 00:52:40.825
Hey.

591
00:52:40.992 --> 00:52:41.993
Sir?

592
00:52:42.076 --> 00:52:44.579
I said to get the chopper
ready. Right there.

593
00:52:44.662 --> 00:52:45.872
Sir. Right away, sir.

594
00:52:46.039 --> 00:52:47.248
Thank you.

595
00:52:47.457 --> 00:52:49.042
- Tyler, come in.
<i>- Copy.</i>

596
00:52:49.459 --> 00:52:51.419
Tyler, can you prepare
the chopper now?

597
00:52:51.544 --> 00:52:54.339
<i>We'll have everything
ready for you in a couple of minutes.</i>

598
00:53:25.661 --> 00:53:28.664
We can't keep meeting
like this, Mr. Golightly.

599
00:53:28.748 --> 00:53:30.083
Oh, yes.

600
00:53:30.166 --> 00:53:33.127
Or do you want to end this
charade and tell me your real name?

601
00:53:33.419 --> 00:53:34.962
Go.

602
00:53:37.882 --> 00:53:41.761
There's so much you don't understand
about this world you've got caught up in.

603
00:53:42.845 --> 00:53:46.224
Spare me the idiot act.
You're British Secret Service.

604
00:53:47.433 --> 00:53:51.187
Impressive work in France, by the way.
When did you realize I was a spy, too?

605
00:53:52.688 --> 00:53:55.983
Oh, pretty much straight away.

606
00:53:56.859 --> 00:53:57.902
Hmm.

607
00:54:00.279 --> 00:54:04.283
I've spent two years undercover.
Simple operation until you showed up.

608
00:54:04.492 --> 00:54:06.244
And I like
to keep things simple.

609
00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:08.996
"Simple" is my middle name.

610
00:54:13.251 --> 00:54:15.128
It would seem you've got
a choice to make.

611
00:54:17.755 --> 00:54:21.676
Temporary suspension of
hostilities? A short-term partnership?

612
00:54:22.844 --> 00:54:24.011
Agreed.
Hmm.

613
00:54:30.643 --> 00:54:31.811
Hmm.

614
00:54:31.978 --> 00:54:34.939
Politicians are even
more gullible than venture capitalists.

615
00:54:35.022 --> 00:54:36.023
<i>That is correct.</i>

616
00:54:36.107 --> 00:54:37.316
Get me a copy
of the target list.

617
00:54:37.650 --> 00:54:39.986
We'll hit them once more
just to be on the safe side.

618
00:54:40.528 --> 00:54:43.656
Give me your phone.
You don't have a phone?

619
00:54:43.781 --> 00:54:46.159
A phone will give anyone
your precise location.

620
00:54:46.242 --> 00:54:48.911
And yet they're so useful
for making phone calls.

621
00:54:48.995 --> 00:54:51.372
Excellent.
I'm not phoning anyone.

622
00:54:52.123 --> 00:54:55.042
I'm gathering evidence.

623
00:54:56.919 --> 00:55:00.756
<i>The target list, Jason.
Four iconic central London landmarks.</i>

624
00:55:00.882 --> 00:55:02.967
<i>Make your selection.
Number three.</i>

625
00:55:03.092 --> 00:55:04.927
<i>The London Eye.</i>

626
00:55:06.179 --> 00:55:11.392
<i>This cyber attack could
potentially impact 16,000 visitors.</i>

627
00:55:16.731 --> 00:55:19.233
I found him snooping
around upstairs.

628
00:55:20.318 --> 00:55:22.236
And who are you exactly?

629
00:55:22.361 --> 00:55:23.821
I'm not telling you anything.

630
00:55:23.905 --> 00:55:24.947
Hmm.

631
00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:28.159
<i>Face recognition
software launched.</i>

632
00:55:28.493 --> 00:55:31.954
<i>Johnny English is a geography
teacher from Lincolnshire.</i>

633
00:55:32.413 --> 00:55:36.250
Rather heavily armed for a lesson
on European capitals, Mr. English.

634
00:55:38.753 --> 00:55:39.962
Any thoughts, sweetheart?

635
00:55:40.963 --> 00:55:42.882
He's British Intelligence.

636
00:55:44.175 --> 00:55:46.344
And there you have it,
two words that have

637
00:55:46.427 --> 00:55:49.347
no right being
in the same sentence together.

638
00:55:49.722 --> 00:55:52.725
Do you really think
I came here alone?

639
00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:56.395
I have a team of crack
operatives out there, right now,

640
00:55:56.479 --> 00:55:57.980
just waiting to strike.

641
00:55:58.064 --> 00:55:59.357
Uh-huh.

642
00:56:04.445 --> 00:56:05.488
<i>Sir!</i>

643
00:56:08.699 --> 00:56:10.993
What has happened
to this country?

644
00:56:11.118 --> 00:56:13.829
How is it possible
that less than a century ago

645
00:56:13.913 --> 00:56:16.916
the British Empire
ruled a quarter of the globe

646
00:56:17.041 --> 00:56:20.628
and now it's relying
on someone

647
00:56:21.796 --> 00:56:24.215
like you?

648
00:56:28.761 --> 00:56:29.804
Hey! Stop!

649
00:56:31.138 --> 00:56:32.139
Stop him?

650
00:56:46.070 --> 00:56:47.071
Go.

651
00:56:55.538 --> 00:56:56.956
- Close the gates.
- Yes, sir.

652
00:57:07.842 --> 00:57:09.176
Help! Stop!

653
00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:11.637
Obstacle directly ahead,
Mrs. Trattner.

654
00:57:11.762 --> 00:57:15.683
Check your mirrors
and bring the car to a stop.

655
00:57:18.019 --> 00:57:19.729
Er, excuse me. Hey.

656
00:57:21.731 --> 00:57:22.732
Thank you.

657
00:57:26.319 --> 00:57:27.320
Drive!

658
00:57:29.614 --> 00:57:30.615
Excuse me.

659
00:57:30.698 --> 00:57:32.450
What...
What do you think you're doing?

660
00:57:32.533 --> 00:57:35.119
Excuse me!
You are not a qualified instructor.

661
00:57:44.295 --> 00:57:46.547
But what about my
instructor? Turn left.

662
00:57:46.631 --> 00:57:47.673
Oh.

663
00:57:48.549 --> 00:57:49.592
Turn right.

664
00:57:54.013 --> 00:57:56.557
For future reference,
I'm on your left.

665
00:57:56.891 --> 00:58:00.394
Please, stop.
I can't do this anymore!

666
00:58:04.774 --> 00:58:06.359
I can't see anything now!

667
00:58:06.859 --> 00:58:07.860
Good.

668
00:58:19.538 --> 00:58:21.499
When I say "go,"
turn sharp right.

669
00:58:21.582 --> 00:58:22.792
Uh-huh.

670
00:58:26.587 --> 00:58:28.839
Three, two, one.

671
00:58:29.340 --> 00:58:30.341
Go!

672
00:58:33.594 --> 00:58:35.513
And straighten up,
straighten up, straighten up.

673
00:58:35.596 --> 00:58:36.806
And go!

674
00:58:37.598 --> 00:58:38.599
Let's go, let's go.

675
00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:49.318
Oh, now just bear left
a little. Good.

676
00:58:49.735 --> 00:58:51.112
Straighten up, straighten up.

677
00:58:55.574 --> 00:58:56.575
Good!

678
00:59:00.705 --> 00:59:02.998
Well, that was
very good, Mrs. Trattner.

679
00:59:05.751 --> 00:59:07.962
I think you made
some real progress today.

680
00:59:09.547 --> 00:59:11.006
<i>You're
not hearing me, English.</i>

681
00:59:11.090 --> 00:59:14.093
<i>Given the Prime Minister's new friendship
with Volta, the situation has changed.</i>

682
00:59:14.176 --> 00:59:18.806
But the facts haven't, sir. That
attack is Volta's responsibility.

683
00:59:18.889 --> 00:59:21.350
According to you, but not
according to anyone else.

684
00:59:21.434 --> 00:59:22.852
Is he here yet?

685
00:59:23.477 --> 00:59:25.855
Good afternoon, Prime
Minister. So, this is, uh...

686
00:59:26.105 --> 00:59:28.899
English, Prime Minister.
Johnny English.

687
00:59:29.191 --> 00:59:31.694
What exactly do you
have to say for yourself?

688
00:59:31.986 --> 00:59:33.738
Rather a lot, actually.

689
00:59:34.029 --> 00:59:37.616
However, men like me don't deal
in prevarication, Prime Minister,

690
00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:39.368
so let me get
straight to the point.

691
00:59:39.452 --> 00:59:42.705
Jason Volta is the man
behind these attacks.

692
00:59:42.788 --> 00:59:45.374
And I have the evidence
to prove it.

693
00:59:46.417 --> 00:59:50.129
I managed to record this
inside Volta's country lair.

694
00:59:50.254 --> 00:59:51.756
But I should warn you,
Prime Minister,

695
00:59:51.881 --> 00:59:55.801
that what you're about to see
is evil incarnate.

696
00:59:57.803 --> 00:59:59.013
Hmm.

697
01:00:01.223 --> 01:00:04.185
<i>Here we are
at Fifi's third birthday!</i>

698
01:00:04.268 --> 01:00:06.520
<i>And it's a very exciting day!</i>

699
01:00:08.314 --> 01:00:11.066
<i>Hip hip, hooray!
Hip hip, hooray!</i>

700
01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:15.279
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

701
01:00:16.447 --> 01:00:20.284
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

702
01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:22.661
Thank you.

703
01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.539
Can I just ask,
what is wrong with you?

704
01:00:26.832 --> 01:00:29.210
The country is in a state
of complete chaos.

705
01:00:29.293 --> 01:00:30.461
The press is wetting itself,

706
01:00:30.544 --> 01:00:32.505
and the only person
capable of saving us

707
01:00:32.588 --> 01:00:34.840
is the man you're accusing
of high treason.

708
01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:39.094
I was in the room myself when
he gave the order, Prime Minister!

709
01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:40.429
But there was a...

710
01:00:40.513 --> 01:00:42.097
Do you know what I was
in the room with, English?

711
01:00:42.223 --> 01:00:43.849
Your file, which I've read,
in its entirety,

712
01:00:43.933 --> 01:00:44.975
and I have a few questions.

713
01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:46.644
Did you or did you not burn

714
01:00:46.727 --> 01:00:49.188
the Cote de Roc restaurant in
Antibes to the ground?

715
01:00:49.271 --> 01:00:50.356
Um...

716
01:00:50.439 --> 01:00:52.817
And did you or did you
not fire a guided missile

717
01:00:52.942 --> 01:00:54.568
at a peloton
of French cyclists?

718
01:00:55.110 --> 01:00:56.111
Well...

719
01:00:56.237 --> 01:00:57.655
Before commandeering
an open-top bus

720
01:00:57.780 --> 01:00:59.907
and tossing the tour guide
off the top deck,

721
01:01:00.032 --> 01:01:02.243
and then assaulting an 82-year-old
grandmother in a sandwich shop

722
01:01:02.368 --> 01:01:04.620
before battering the employee
of said sandwich shop

723
01:01:04.703 --> 01:01:06.622
with two organic
sourdough baguettes?

724
01:01:07.748 --> 01:01:09.500
Uh, I don't remember the...

725
01:01:09.625 --> 01:01:12.711
Do you have any idea
how hard it is to be me?

726
01:01:14.296 --> 01:01:15.923
- Uh...
- Hmm?

727
01:01:16.841 --> 01:01:18.843
Do you have even
the foggiest notion

728
01:01:18.968 --> 01:01:22.471
of how virtually impossible
it is to get anything done

729
01:01:22.596 --> 01:01:27.268
in the face of events
and facts and voters

730
01:01:27.393 --> 01:01:30.521
and that tsunami of tosspots
we call "the national press"?

731
01:01:30.646 --> 01:01:33.983
Finally I get the chance to do
something good for my country,

732
01:01:34.066 --> 01:01:35.317
and what happens?

733
01:01:35.442 --> 01:01:38.028
The universe sends me you.

734
01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:41.323
Well, do you know what I say?

735
01:01:41.407 --> 01:01:44.326
I say, up the universe's arse!

736
01:01:44.451 --> 01:01:46.495
And do you know what
else I say? You're fired.

737
01:01:46.579 --> 01:01:48.622
With immediate effect.
Now get out!

738
01:01:48.998 --> 01:01:53.043
And make sure I never clap
eyes on that imbecile ever again!

739
01:02:35.002 --> 01:02:36.837
What
are you doing, sir?

740
01:02:37.922 --> 01:02:41.050
What do you think I'm doing,
Bough? I'm going home.

741
01:02:41.425 --> 01:02:43.844
But the Prime Minister is
finalizing her deal with Volta.

742
01:02:43.969 --> 01:02:47.222
She's taking him to the G12 Summit
in Scotland as her special guest.

743
01:02:47.348 --> 01:02:51.352
It's over, Bough. And there's
absolutely nothing we can do about it.

744
01:02:52.061 --> 01:02:54.730
But, sir, I have a plan.

745
01:02:55.105 --> 01:02:56.899
Remember my wife?

746
01:03:05.783 --> 01:03:07.076
Clear your baffles.

747
01:03:07.785 --> 01:03:09.578
What?
Mind your head, sir.

748
01:03:09.662 --> 01:03:10.746
Ow!

749
01:03:13.832 --> 01:03:15.084
This says we're sinking.

750
01:03:18.754 --> 01:03:23.634
She's old and a little rusty, but she
can put on a hell of a fireworks display.

751
01:03:40.526 --> 01:03:42.319
Excellent work, Commander.

752
01:03:42.611 --> 01:03:45.406
Jeremy has always spoken very
highly of you, Agent English.

753
01:03:46.573 --> 01:03:47.574
Who?

754
01:03:49.493 --> 01:03:50.661
Oh.

755
01:03:50.744 --> 01:03:52.413
Oh, yes, yes.

756
01:03:54.289 --> 01:03:56.417
I'm no fan of the pen
pushers myself, so

757
01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:58.460
when orders came through
stationing us here for the Summit,

758
01:03:58.544 --> 01:04:00.963
well, I thought a lift
was the least I could do.

759
01:04:01.296 --> 01:04:03.215
Right, let's get
a move on, Bough.

760
01:04:04.633 --> 01:04:06.385
Oh, if you wouldn't mind
keeping your mobiles off

761
01:04:06.468 --> 01:04:07.803
until you're well clear,
gentlemen.

762
01:04:07.886 --> 01:04:10.389
The launch systems on the
missiles are a bit 1980s.

763
01:04:10.472 --> 01:04:13.225
Gets a tad twitchy
around microwave radiation.

764
01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:17.354
No problem there, Commander.
We're doing this mission old-school.

765
01:04:27.489 --> 01:04:29.158
This spot is perfect.

766
01:04:30.743 --> 01:04:32.077
Come on.

767
01:04:47.593 --> 01:04:48.594
Sorry, sir.

768
01:04:48.677 --> 01:04:50.137
Come on, come on...

769
01:04:52.014 --> 01:04:53.766
Right, Bough. Our
mission here is simple.

770
01:04:53.932 --> 01:04:57.311
Gain access to Volta's bedroom
and take him out.

771
01:04:57.728 --> 01:04:59.354
How are you going
to get up there, though, sir?

772
01:05:00.064 --> 01:05:03.358
A walk in the park
for the exoskeleton.

773
01:05:09.823 --> 01:05:12.868
Remotely operated
neoprene bodysuit.

774
01:05:12.993 --> 01:05:15.913
Increases the wearer's
strength 100 times.

775
01:05:16.288 --> 01:05:19.583
Right, power it up. Stick in
the floppy disk and let's go.

776
01:05:27.883 --> 01:05:28.884
Just...

777
01:05:45.359 --> 01:05:46.568
Crikey, sir!

778
01:06:03.001 --> 01:06:04.837
When will
the weapon be ready?

779
01:06:04.962 --> 01:06:08.590
<i>As soon as the Prime
Minister signs the agreement, tonight.</i>

780
01:06:08.715 --> 01:06:10.050
How do I fire it?

781
01:06:10.175 --> 01:06:12.761
<i>Press once and the attack
is launched.</i>

782
01:06:13.011 --> 01:06:16.473
<i>After which, the data
of every G12 country</i>

783
01:06:16.598 --> 01:06:20.102
<i>will be transferred to the
servers onboard the</i> Dot Calm.

784
01:06:20.185 --> 01:06:21.186
Perfect.

785
01:06:22.855 --> 01:06:23.939
Ah.

786
01:06:25.357 --> 01:06:26.358
Cheers.

787
01:06:34.783 --> 01:06:38.078
You're working for Russian Intelligence
and you have been from the start.

788
01:06:38.579 --> 01:06:41.331
Which is why I've taken an antidote
to the poison you keep in your ring,

789
01:06:41.415 --> 01:06:43.083
and which you've poured
into this drink.

790
01:06:44.835 --> 01:06:47.129
And removed the firing pin
from that pistol.

791
01:06:55.971 --> 01:06:57.931
Everyone has to make a life
for themselves.

792
01:06:58.223 --> 01:07:00.350
It's just sad that yours is

793
01:07:01.435 --> 01:07:02.477
over.

794
01:07:02.561 --> 01:07:03.645
Hmm.

795
01:07:03.729 --> 01:07:07.024
Fresh from my 3D printer.
Hundred percent plastic.

796
01:07:10.235 --> 01:07:11.904
And 100% deadly.

797
01:07:13.071 --> 01:07:14.990
Killing me won't save you.

798
01:07:15.908 --> 01:07:16.909
Don't bet on it.

799
01:07:21.663 --> 01:07:24.041
Seriously,
this cannot be happening.

800
01:07:24.249 --> 01:07:26.126
Oh, but it is.

801
01:07:27.169 --> 01:07:28.337
Drop the gun.

802
01:07:29.254 --> 01:07:30.589
Get your hands in the air.

803
01:07:31.548 --> 01:07:32.549
And you.

804
01:07:40.641 --> 01:07:41.934
There's no time
for this, Johnny.

805
01:07:42.809 --> 01:07:44.269
Oh, it isn't possible.

806
01:07:44.353 --> 01:07:47.105
You cannot be working
with this English idiot!

807
01:07:47.189 --> 01:07:50.609
Save the pillow talk
for your prison cell, Volta.

808
01:07:50.943 --> 01:07:54.780
Are you inside, sir? Yes, yes,
Bough, you can power down.

809
01:07:55.155 --> 01:07:56.990
Everything is under control.

810
01:07:57.950 --> 01:07:59.284
Shut down.

811
01:08:23.850 --> 01:08:26.270
An historic venue
for an historic meeting.

812
01:08:26.353 --> 01:08:30.274
The delegates from each G12 member
nation will have their own priorities...

813
01:08:41.618 --> 01:08:43.161
How do we get in now, sir?

814
01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:53.588
What's the plan?

815
01:09:28.665 --> 01:09:30.083
Hey, you!

816
01:09:30.751 --> 01:09:31.835
Hey!

817
01:09:47.893 --> 01:09:50.687
Thank you very much. I hope
you have everything you need.

818
01:10:07.579 --> 01:10:08.789
Ow!

819
01:10:09.039 --> 01:10:10.582
On behalf
of the United Kingdom,

820
01:10:10.707 --> 01:10:14.252
may I welcome you here today
to this ancient meeting chamber

821
01:10:14.378 --> 01:10:16.671
where the great Scottish clans

822
01:10:16.797 --> 01:10:20.550
once settled their differences
and forged new alliances.

823
01:10:21.301 --> 01:10:23.512
A place I have
specifically chosen

824
01:10:23.595 --> 01:10:26.807
in order to make
a very special announcement.

825
01:10:27.808 --> 01:10:28.809
Sir?

826
01:10:30.102 --> 01:10:34.064
Are you all right, sir?
No, I'm not all right. Get me up, Bough.

827
01:10:37.776 --> 01:10:41.321
It's very heavy, sir.
I know how heavy it is, Bough.

828
01:10:44.241 --> 01:10:45.951
We've got to get
to the conference...

829
01:10:47.869 --> 01:10:50.080
To the conference room
before Volta...

830
01:10:51.790 --> 01:10:54.000
Before Volta triggers
his weapon.

831
01:10:55.544 --> 01:10:59.339
And so, with my signature
on this agreement...

832
01:11:01.049 --> 01:11:03.135
...it gives me
great pleasure, oh,

833
01:11:03.218 --> 01:11:07.931
to welcome to you my guest,
my friend, Jason Volta.

834
01:11:10.851 --> 01:11:14.187
<i>Standing
by to launch attack, Jason.</i>

835
01:11:14.479 --> 01:11:16.648
Damn it, get me out
of this stuff. Johnny?

836
01:11:16.773 --> 01:11:18.775
- I can't see the join, sir.
- It's the clasp.

837
01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:21.862
Release the clasp and the
top and the bottom separate.

838
01:11:23.822 --> 01:11:25.782
Must have jammed
when you fell over, sir.

839
01:11:25.949 --> 01:11:27.993
For goodness sake.
Wait. Try this.

840
01:11:34.875 --> 01:11:36.877
That is quite
a lot of oil, sir.

841
01:11:37.961 --> 01:11:40.380
Oh, come on!
Come on, come on...

842
01:11:41.506 --> 01:11:45.218
Can you imagine what the world
would look like if it was run by Apple?

843
01:11:46.678 --> 01:11:49.097
Or Google? Or...

844
01:11:49.639 --> 01:11:50.724
Me?

845
01:11:53.977 --> 01:11:56.062
Do you think
you'd have failing schools?

846
01:11:56.813 --> 01:11:59.149
Do you think you'd have
endless waiting in your hospitals?

847
01:11:59.232 --> 01:12:00.233
No.

848
01:12:00.317 --> 01:12:03.069
Think you'd have such
long lines in your airports?

849
01:12:03.195 --> 01:12:04.738
- No.
- No.

850
01:12:05.071 --> 01:12:09.493
No, because all of these are
simple data management problems.

851
01:12:09.618 --> 01:12:12.287
And people like me,
we love data.

852
01:12:13.038 --> 01:12:15.707
We live for data.

853
01:12:16.124 --> 01:12:17.834
Ha!
My...

854
01:12:17.959 --> 01:12:20.295
Do you know
what I live for, Volta?

855
01:12:20.378 --> 01:12:21.379
God.

856
01:12:21.463 --> 01:12:26.843
Eliminating the threat that lying
villains like you pose to this country.

857
01:12:27.135 --> 01:12:28.345
Oh, for God's sake.

858
01:12:28.637 --> 01:12:30.180
Who is he?

859
01:12:30.347 --> 01:12:31.765
Arrest this whack job.

860
01:12:31.890 --> 01:12:34.976
The only person ordering an
arrest around here will be me.

861
01:12:35.769 --> 01:12:38.146
There's no cause for concern,
ladies and gentlemen,

862
01:12:38.271 --> 01:12:42.943
you are now in the capable hands
of Her Majesty's Secret Service.

863
01:12:43.276 --> 01:12:47.948
And you, my friend, are in for
an uncomfortable ride.

864
01:13:04.464 --> 01:13:05.799
Where was I?

865
01:13:07.259 --> 01:13:09.010
Living for data.

866
01:13:09.386 --> 01:13:10.470
Exactly.

867
01:13:11.805 --> 01:13:16.810
My algorithms can solve every one of
your problems as long as I have one thing.

868
01:13:16.893 --> 01:13:17.978
Control.

869
01:13:18.645 --> 01:13:21.982
And that is what you are about
to give me now.

870
01:13:22.607 --> 01:13:24.776
Jason, I wonder
if you could just clarify...

871
01:13:24.859 --> 01:13:25.944
Shut up.

872
01:13:26.486 --> 01:13:27.737
Now, hold on.

873
01:13:29.072 --> 01:13:30.740
<i>Castle now locked down</i>

874
01:13:31.783 --> 01:13:34.035
<i>and under your control, Jason.</i>

875
01:13:35.996 --> 01:13:38.415
The agreement this ignoramus
just signed

876
01:13:38.498 --> 01:13:41.167
didn't just give me access
to all the UK's data.

877
01:13:41.293 --> 01:13:45.255
It also gave me access to a
junction box, in North Ayrshire

878
01:13:45.380 --> 01:13:47.924
that connects
the entire World Wide Web.

879
01:13:48.216 --> 01:13:53.888
Disable the fiber-optic cables in that
box and the Internet will cease to exist.

880
01:13:55.181 --> 01:13:57.767
Johnny? Are you okay?

881
01:14:05.108 --> 01:14:07.944
Have you got a phone?
We need to call for backup.

882
01:14:08.028 --> 01:14:10.989
There's no time for backup.
I'm going after Volta.

883
01:14:11.072 --> 01:14:12.782
And don't lose that one!

884
01:14:13.825 --> 01:14:17.746
Do you understand what it
means if I turn the Internet off?

885
01:14:17.954 --> 01:14:22.292
Cities will go dark. Planes
will fall out of the sky.

886
01:14:23.001 --> 01:14:26.463
Trains will collide.
Law and order will break down

887
01:14:26.546 --> 01:14:29.424
and the world as you know it
will be over.

888
01:14:30.133 --> 01:14:32.761
Show, don't tell, right?

889
01:14:36.556 --> 01:14:38.558
<i>Initiating attack, Jason.</i>

890
01:14:39.476 --> 01:14:41.478
<i>Taking control
of junction box.</i>

891
01:14:42.604 --> 01:14:47.484
<i>Suspending Internet and electricity
supply across Britain and Europe.</i>

892
01:14:48.526 --> 01:14:50.945
<i>Stage one of attack complete.</i>

893
01:14:51.446 --> 01:14:54.741
Ladies and gentlemen.
I can stop the attack

894
01:14:54.824 --> 01:14:58.328
as long as each of you signs the
same agreement as the Prime Minister,

895
01:14:58.411 --> 01:15:00.413
giving me complete control.

896
01:15:01.331 --> 01:15:02.749
Your call.

897
01:15:03.583 --> 01:15:06.378
<i>Welcome to British Intelligence.</i>
Get me Pegasus!

898
01:15:06.795 --> 01:15:10.548
<i>For MI5, press one.
For MI6, press two.</i>

899
01:15:10.965 --> 01:15:13.301
<i>For MI7, press three.</i>

900
01:15:19.891 --> 01:15:23.061
<i>Eight G12 signatures
now acquired.</i>

901
01:15:24.104 --> 01:15:26.690
Signal the chopper,
we're almost done here.

902
01:15:27.107 --> 01:15:28.900
<i>For accounts, press five.</i>

903
01:15:28.983 --> 01:15:31.319
<i>For childcare services, press six.</i>
Oh, come on!

904
01:15:31.444 --> 01:15:33.780
<i>For more options, press seven.</i>

905
01:15:36.324 --> 01:15:37.325
What?

906
01:15:38.743 --> 01:15:43.915
<i>Only two further signatures required
to achieve control of G12 nations' data.</i>

907
01:15:44.749 --> 01:15:46.167
<i>All UK data</i>

908
01:15:46.251 --> 01:15:49.045
<i>now successfully transferred
to the</i> Dot Calm.

909
01:15:49.170 --> 01:15:52.674
<i>For Aphrodite,
press one. For Pegasus, press two.</i>

910
01:15:55.218 --> 01:15:56.219
Oh, my God.

911
01:15:56.302 --> 01:16:00.014
<i>Dive the submarine.
Repeat, dive the submarine.</i>

912
01:16:02.809 --> 01:16:04.936
Director's office?
<i>This is Johnny English.</i>

913
01:16:05.061 --> 01:16:09.274
I need to speak to Pegasus
immediately. It's a national emergency.

914
01:16:09.399 --> 01:16:10.900
One moment, please, sir.

915
01:16:12.861 --> 01:16:13.903
<i>This is</i> HMS Vengeance.

916
01:16:14.028 --> 01:16:17.657
We have a full launch code.
Repeat, launch code is locked.

917
01:16:17.782 --> 01:16:19.784
<i>Do I have your permission
to fire?</i>

918
01:16:19.909 --> 01:16:22.245
Oh, my God. Could you hold on
one moment, please?

919
01:16:22.370 --> 01:16:24.122
Sir? Sir!

920
01:16:25.081 --> 01:16:26.082
Hello?

921
01:16:26.332 --> 01:16:27.333
<i>Hello?</i>

922
01:16:27.417 --> 01:16:30.545
Sir! <i>HMS Vengeance</i> here. Do I
have your permission to launch?

923
01:16:30.670 --> 01:16:33.590
<i>What? Listen,
we have to call in an attack.</i>

924
01:16:33.673 --> 01:16:34.924
<i>Did you say
"attack," sir?</i>

925
01:16:35.008 --> 01:16:37.343
<i>Yes, an attack. Attack.</i>

926
01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:41.389
General quarters,
we are go for launch.

927
01:16:41.514 --> 01:16:43.433
Target coordinates locked,
Commander.

928
01:16:43.558 --> 01:16:44.559
Hello?

929
01:16:46.478 --> 01:16:47.520
Hello?

930
01:16:57.947 --> 01:17:00.492
Commander, the
missile is being redirected.

931
01:17:01.326 --> 01:17:03.995
It seems to be locking on
to a new hostile target.

932
01:17:06.623 --> 01:17:07.999
What's a "Sherbet F"?

933
01:17:19.302 --> 01:17:21.429
Oh, no. What was
that?

934
01:17:22.972 --> 01:17:26.017
Dot Calm <i>appears
to be offline, Jason.</i>

935
01:17:26.184 --> 01:17:28.853
<i>The cyber attack
has been halted.</i>

936
01:17:32.899 --> 01:17:34.234
Did you

937
01:17:34.609 --> 01:17:37.195
make a call quite close
to the submarine, sir?

938
01:17:40.073 --> 01:17:41.199
Um...

939
01:17:41.282 --> 01:17:42.367
Because...

940
01:17:43.368 --> 01:17:44.702
You did it, sir!

941
01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:47.622
Mission accomplished!

942
01:17:48.164 --> 01:17:49.666
Well, exactly!

943
01:17:51.417 --> 01:17:54.504
<i>I am re-evaluating
our options, Jason.</i>

944
01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:02.846
Johnny! Johnny!

945
01:18:02.929 --> 01:18:06.015
Volta is getting away! He's
heading for his helicopter!

946
01:18:06.099 --> 01:18:07.392
No, Bough.

947
01:18:08.601 --> 01:18:10.270
This one's mine.

948
01:18:43.887 --> 01:18:45.555
Careful, sir. Sir?

949
01:18:56.608 --> 01:18:58.276
Last two steps, sir.

950
01:19:03.364 --> 01:19:05.283
Not so fast, Volta!

951
01:19:06.910 --> 01:19:08.995
Is this supposed to scare me,
Sir Lancelot?

952
01:19:14.125 --> 01:19:15.376
Take cover, Bough.

953
01:19:22.008 --> 01:19:25.553
Don't worry, he's only got six
bullets in that thing.

954
01:19:29.015 --> 01:19:30.725
And, of course,
the thing itself.

955
01:19:33.144 --> 01:19:35.188
You've run out
of options, Volta.

956
01:19:36.022 --> 01:19:37.315
Oh, you think you've won?

957
01:19:37.398 --> 01:19:38.608
Mmm.

958
01:19:39.192 --> 01:19:42.236
<i>Rerouting the attack
to our Nevada servers, Jason.</i>

959
01:19:42.862 --> 01:19:46.866
The world's going down, English.
And I'll be the last man standing.

960
01:19:47.492 --> 01:19:50.536
Goodbye, English!
Goodbye, Internet.

961
01:19:51.788 --> 01:19:56.459
I've got it. That's a Gazelle
341 light attack helicopter.

962
01:19:57.043 --> 01:19:59.545
If we can hack into
its operating system,

963
01:19:59.796 --> 01:20:01.798
we can disable
the drive function.

964
01:20:02.090 --> 01:20:03.091
Here.

965
01:20:06.928 --> 01:20:11.057
Look at you! You couldn't use
that thing if your life depended on it!

966
01:20:14.018 --> 01:20:15.395
Let's get outta here.

967
01:20:16.104 --> 01:20:17.814
Get this steel bird in the...

968
01:20:23.027 --> 01:20:27.949
<i>Rerouting complete. Attack
data now installed at our Nevada servers.</i>

969
01:20:28.366 --> 01:20:30.159
<i>Should I initiate?</i>

970
01:20:30.576 --> 01:20:31.577
<i>Jason?</i>

971
01:20:36.249 --> 01:20:38.418
<i>Should I initiate
the new attack?</i>

972
01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:41.963
Initiate this!

973
01:20:42.046 --> 01:20:44.465
Jason.

974
01:20:55.727 --> 01:20:57.061
Well, uh,
ladies and gentlemen.

975
01:20:57.186 --> 01:21:01.065
I think we can all agree, that wasn't
quite the evening we were expecting.

976
01:21:06.404 --> 01:21:08.406
I had hoped to
present to you tonight...

977
01:21:08.531 --> 01:21:10.825
Thank you... a vision
of what Britain might be.

978
01:21:11.242 --> 01:21:14.996
But, as it happens, the man
who saved us all this evening,

979
01:21:15.079 --> 01:21:18.624
the man who, I might add, I
personally assigned to this case,

980
01:21:19.250 --> 01:21:21.461
has presented us with
a different kind of vision.

981
01:21:21.544 --> 01:21:25.840
A living embodiment, if you like, of
those fundamental British qualities

982
01:21:25.923 --> 01:21:30.219
that have ensured that our
beloved island nation endures.

983
01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:33.639
Courage under fire,
endless ingenuity

984
01:21:33.723 --> 01:21:35.641
and above all, a quiet

985
01:21:36.267 --> 01:21:38.978
unassailable dignity.

986
01:21:58.122 --> 01:21:59.373
Thank you.

987
01:22:06.547 --> 01:22:07.965
All together.

988
01:22:18.851 --> 01:22:20.561
Welcome back, Mr. English.

989
01:22:20.645 --> 01:22:21.813
Thank you, Headmaster.

990
01:22:21.896 --> 01:22:23.606
Thank you for agreeing
to be our guest speaker.

991
01:22:23.689 --> 01:22:26.484
Now the governors and staff are
all waiting for us in the rose garden.

992
01:22:26.567 --> 01:22:29.487
Yes, if you could just excuse
me for a few minutes, Headmaster.

993
01:22:35.243 --> 01:22:36.244
Oh.

994
01:22:38.121 --> 01:22:39.372
Morning, sir!
Hello, sir!

995
01:22:39.455 --> 01:22:41.707
Welcome back, sir!

996
01:22:45.753 --> 01:22:46.838
Surprise!

997
01:22:47.797 --> 01:22:48.965
Thank you.

998
01:22:50.174 --> 01:22:51.759
Where's Straker?

999
01:22:52.677 --> 01:22:54.470
Good.
Here, sir.

1000
01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:56.639
And, of course, Baggaley.

1001
01:22:57.932 --> 01:22:59.016
That was very good.
Very good.

1002
01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:00.643
All right, gather round,
everyone. Gather round.

1003
01:23:01.894 --> 01:23:03.813
I've got some toys
to show you.

1004
01:23:03.896 --> 01:23:05.439
Ooh!
There we go.

1005
01:23:06.524 --> 01:23:08.818
There we are. There we are.

1006
01:23:09.318 --> 01:23:11.404
- Breadstick blowpipe, anyone?
- Me!

1007
01:23:11.487 --> 01:23:12.530
There you go.

1008
01:23:12.613 --> 01:23:14.866
Granny Smith hand grenade?

1009
01:23:15.408 --> 01:23:17.410
And what about a
garroting watch? Here, sir.

1010
01:23:17.493 --> 01:23:18.494
There you go.

1011
01:23:19.871 --> 01:23:21.581
Ooh!
Here, let me take that.

1012
01:23:21.706 --> 01:23:24.000
Don't worry, it's only a
mild sedative.

1013
01:23:25.209 --> 01:23:27.712
Oh! That's just
a five-second fuse.

1014
01:23:28.963 --> 01:23:31.591
Yes, all right, we all know
what garroting looks like.

1015
01:23:31.716 --> 01:23:33.718
Whenever you're ready,
Mr. English.

1016
01:23:33.843 --> 01:23:36.429
Oh, I'm sorry, Headmaster,
I'll just be one moment.

1017
01:23:36.554 --> 01:23:38.723
Just take those. Thank you.
Ooh.

1018
01:23:39.599 --> 01:23:42.643
Put those away, shall we?
There we...

1019
01:23:43.352 --> 01:23:44.520
Um...

1020
01:23:45.354 --> 01:23:47.190
I always
did love a jelly baby.
