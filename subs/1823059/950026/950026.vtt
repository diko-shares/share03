00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.800
Yeah, thank you so much.

8
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.600
What do you say?

9
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.860
I want you to fuck me.

10
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.400
Harder.

11
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.160
God, I'm begging you!

12
00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.700
A simple "please"
is more than acceptable.

13
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:37.460
I'm not sure of how or why
these things happen, but they do.

14
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.260
And to be frank with you,
we have very few options.

15
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:47.000
Sadly, this is one of the times
where medicine lies sorely behind.

16
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.460
Since I'm not
your first consultation,

17
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.260
you know it's my professional duty
to advise you regarding surgery.

18
00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.560
But you probably also know

19
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.121
that could yield very little
in prolonging your life.

20
00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.298
I'm sorry.

[Church bell]

22
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.960
Really, Mason,

23
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.660
is it too much to ask your secretary
to call me, to tell me you canceled lunch?

24
00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.460
I'm sorry, Beck.

25
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.000
You said I had to be there
to sign papers.

26
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.960
You know that girl, Susie Clyde,
that you played bridge with?

27
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.560
Listen to me. Do you know
why her husband married her?

28
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.760
Her father owns half of Korea

29
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.660
and her father's got my balls
on a silver platter in fucking China.

30
00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.160
Stop it.

31
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.660
First of all, you're talking
about two entirely different countries.

32
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.200
Second, you know I can't stand it,
when you speak about people like that.

33
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.560
Oh, yeah?

34
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.660
I asked you to come down here
so that I can sign

35
00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.560
some of these stocks over
and put them in your name.

36
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.160
So I can get out from underneath
this goddamn audit.

37
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.560
You're not in some kind of trouble,
are you?

38
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.860
We're gonna have to do a little
creative accounting, honey.

39
00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.860
And you're gonna have to help.

40
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.060
So, sign the papers and…

41
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.860
I don't know
if I'm gonna be home for dinner.

42
00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.400
It's important
that we eat dinner as a family.

43
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.700
It sure as hell is.

bitter they lost.

53
00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.260
Loser.

54
00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.400
- Grow up.
- Bitter loser.

55
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.060
I told you, you'd be late
if you played tennis.

56
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.000
There some things
you just can't squeeze in.

HANK: I had to get back the money
I lost last night.

58
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.647
Oh, look at you.

59
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.443
I told you:
no more Vegas weekends.

60
00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.660
How much?

61
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.960
Would it help if I told you I fell
in love over the whole thing?

62
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.160
You always tell us that
the money can't buy you love.

63
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.160
Well, except for in Ace's case here.

64
00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.760
Leave Janice out of this.

65
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.660
I think you
should leave Janice out of this.

66
00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.160
But then, what the hell
kind of a merger would this be?

67

Have you seen my calendar?

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.160
No, I believe I saw it this morning
in Mr. Mason's office.

71
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.460
Do you want me to go get it?

72
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.060
- Oh, would you mind, please?
- Sure.

73
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.161
Aaron!

74
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:49.460
Aaron, do you plan
on being late for everything

75
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.560
or only unimportant events
like our engagement party

76
00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.735
that my mother has spent
the last six months planning?

77
00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:57.660
HANK: You'll be
very pleased to know, mom,

78
00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:00.460
that I purposely let all that money
slip through my fingers

79
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:06.100
figuring if she still loves me by the time
it's all gone, then maybe she is the one.

80
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.000
No jeans. Go change.

81
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:16.060
- Here you go, dear.
- Oh, thank you very much.

82
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:17.160

83

And so I'm telling you,

90
00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.160
she's trying to convince me
to get a nipple ring.

91
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.060
It's gonna make everything
a bit more exciting.

92
00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.760
What is she talking about?
Nipple clamps?

93
00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.660
She is just fantastic.

- Don't worry.
- I'll get you a drink.

- I need a drink.
- Okay.

Oh, my god.

98
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:17.060
She is just fantastic.

99
00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:23.860
She tied us together an then she strapped
a dual butterfly between us.

100
00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.760
- Butterfly?
- Oh, a vibrator.

101
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.760
She is amazing. Okay?
I came three times.

102
00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:33.660
Then she had to pull me down
from the ceiling.

103
00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:36.000
No, I'm not kidding.

104
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.060
So, you're having your ceiling repainted?

105
00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.800
Yeah, yeah.

106
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.860
Well, we've heard
a lot of stories here tonight

107
00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.500
and I wanna hear your story.

108
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.860
- My story?
- Yeah.

109
00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:55.712
Believe me,
I have no story.

110
00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:59.660
Well, you've got to have some story.

111
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:03.066
I mean, what's your pleasure?
What do you like?

112
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:07.560
What gets you hot?
You know, your fantasy.

113
00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.588
You don't have any answer for that?

114
00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:11.800
No, I'm married.

115
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Oh, Becks.

116
00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.060
Is she playing coy with me?

117
00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.960
What is it

118
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.924
that you just simply

119
00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.960
can't resist?

120
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.990
You, evidently.

121
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.992
It's late, and I would like to take
advantage of this buzz.

122
00:10:31.032 --> 00:10:33.979
Alright, ladies.
That's it for me.

123
00:10:34.019 --> 00:10:36.298
Oh, I like your pants.

124
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.400
Oh, thank you.

125
00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:44.086
- Ooh, ooh, girl.
- She's very subtle.

126
00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:48.760
A double or like a triple heart bypass.

127
00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.013
Well, you hang in there.

128
00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.900
I know in your line of work
time is money.

129
00:10:54.200 --> 00:11:00.401
I'd like to compensate you
for my senior moments.

130
00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:04.676
No worries.

131
00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.060
What is it?

132
00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:29.060
I know it when I see it.
When you guys look at each other is…

133
00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.960
Even them, tonight.
I felt it.

134
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.560
Oh, god!
You could have felt them in New Jersey, right?

135
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:44.160
The truth is, we just are lucky.
But we work like hell. Don't we?

136
00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.360
We keep it exciting.

137
00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:50.660
Work I can do.
The other part is missing.

138
00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:57.860
Okay, huh…

139
00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:02.400
I'm gonna tell you something
that I've never told anybody.

140
00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:13.060
You know everything that
is to know about me, right?

141
00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:16.960
Well…

142
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.460
I've never, ever…

143
00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:26.842
Baby, we know it's not good
between you and asshole.

144
00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:30.060
It's not that, no.

145
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.960
What?

146
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.460
Oh, for God's sake.

147
00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:36.418
Come on, out with it.

148
00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.760
I…

149
00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.860
I have never…

150
00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:45.012
You've never come?

151
00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:59.709
Exactly.

152
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.160
SHIRIN: Mason?

153
00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.960
He is such a man's man?

154
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.660
REBECCA: We just do it twice a year.

155
00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:14.960
We are both fine with that.

156
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.160
Oh, Becks!

157
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.360
Oh, you must have to masturbate.

158
00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.060
Don't say that word.

159
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:23.202
What, "masturbate"?

160
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.287
I've been to a bunch of doctors,

161
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.660
a bunch of therapists.

162
00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:31.760
Something is wrong with me.

163
00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.060
What's going on, Rebecca?

164
00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:38.960
I've never once had that
passion in my life.

165
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.560
Damn it.

166
00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.660
Is it so wrong for me to want…

167
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.360
Come over tonight.

168
00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.860
Have dinner with us
and we'll come up with something.

169
00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.200
I promise.

170
00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:55.000
Am I like your project now?

171
00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:57.000
Right.
Forget your friggin schedule.

172
00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.482
Just be there at 8:00.

173
00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:08.393
You know what?

174
00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.000
What you need is a vibrator.

175
00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:14.000
No. That gives me the willies.

176
00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.499
KELLY: I know, weed.
Let's get her stoned.

177
00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.560
No, I don't do drugs.

178
00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.260
No, I do know.

179
00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:24.107
I think you should seriously consider
taking a lover.

180
00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:26.900
That is, if you don't mind
breaking your vows.

181
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.300
No moral quandary there,
believe me, but…

182
00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:33.000
What am I supposed to do?
Just go to some guy in the street?

183
00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:35.860
No, no.
I mean a woman.

184
00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:37.120
What?

185
00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:38.860
A woman lover.

186
00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.460
Oh, come on.

187
00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:43.960
Just hear me out
and do not listen to her, okay?

188
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.060
A woman is so much more
familiar with the manual.

189
00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:48.360
Who?

190
00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:49.560
Wait.

191
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:53.060
I'm talking about a woman, you know,
who has all kinds of tricks up her sleeves,

192
00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.960
who's used to particular situations…

193
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:56.960
And as it happens,

194
00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.360
I happen to have a second cousin
who runs this service business,

195
00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:02.560
and she could get you
hooked up.

196
00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.188
Service business?

197
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.000
SHIRIN: Kind of the dark sheep of the family.

198
00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:14.400
SHIRIN: Valentina has got
the finest women I have ever seen.

199
00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:16.500
SHIRIN: Smoking.

200
00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.400
KELLY: Hey, hey, hey. Settle.

201
00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.000
Oh, my god.

202
00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:23.461
No one will ever find out.

203
00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.645
REBECCA: I thought that was just for men.

204
00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.062
REBECCA: Are you kidding me?

205
00:16:27.102 --> 00:16:29.860
I mean, women actually do that?

206
00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:30.860
SHIRIN: Oh, of course.

207
00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:34.860
SHIRIN: You have to think of this
as an experiment, okay?

208
00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:36.760
It hasn't happened with a schlong.

209
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.100
You are hiring her for a service.
A very specific service.

210
00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:46.500
VALENTINA: No, no, no. That's fine.
Nothing is too odd for us.

211
00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.360
What have you got to lose?

212
00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.400
Not a lot at this point.

213
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.3000
[Telephone rings]

214
00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:04.160
Better to serve you.

215
00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.860
Oh, hi, Shirin.

216
00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:10.800
No, no, I'm sure
we can find someone for her.

217
00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.600
Fine. Consider it taken care of.

218
00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:26.160
Okay. This one should be fun.
Feel like educating?

219
00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.560
Oh, yeah.
What do you got, a virgin boy?

220
00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:29.760
Calm down, cougar.

221
00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:33.700
No, this is a housewife from the burbs
looking for a new adventure.

222
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.500
SINGING:
Just a little Latin now.

223
00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:37.500
SINGING:
Just a little singing, we…

224
00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.500
Shut the fuck up!

225
00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:42.360
I am speaking to an employee.

226
00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:46.360
Sylvie, look, this is a friend
of my cousin's, okay?

227
00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.560
She's never been
with a woman before

228
00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.700
but my lesbian cousin has explained to her
that women make better lovers.

229
00:17:51.748 --> 00:17:53.700
Yeah. Tell me something
I don't know.

230
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.260
And she's from money.

231
00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.460
So I want this to go really well.

232
00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:58.960
Just think
of all the referrals I could get

233
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.200
from that upper crust stuffy
country club set of hers.

234
00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:05.460
So I want you
to do right by her, alright?

235
00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:09.160
And besides, she wanted
someone closer to her own age.

236
00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.660
Sorry.

237
00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:12.160
Now sing.

238
00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.800
SINGING:
I wanna feel this moment

239
00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.260
SINGING:
though I can't control it

240
00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:20.700
SINGING:
if it's all I ever do.

241
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.960
That's what I'm going in with
for my audition.

242
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.400
And then, when I cut my single,
I'm done with all of this.

243
00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:28.060
And what happened
to your other hits?

244
00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:29.460
Sylvie, play nice.

245
00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:33.460
Now, I handpicked you for this
and I don't want you to disappoint me.

246
00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:38.200
Sylvie, don't be late.
I hear she's a stickler for time.

247
00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:41.060
You know how much I hate
to ask you to take a call but it's Molly.

248
00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:43.760
She's invited me
to her fiance's parents house

249
00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.160
so it's a big fuck deal.

250
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.100
I gotta go, okay?

251
00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:52.060
Client is fully vetted,
handpicked by Valentina,

252
00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:56.760
so crème de la crème,
all the good stuff, right?

253
00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.260
Oh, sweetheart, I love you.
Christ, I love you.

254
00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:00.460
Oh, fuck!
I almost forgot!

255
00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:05.000
The client is a real stickler for time
so don't be late, alright?

256
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
[Sigh]

257
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
[Claps hands]

258
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.514
Oh, shit.

259
00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.225
This is insane.

260
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.021
What am I doing?

261
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.100
[Knocking at the door]

262
00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.360
May I help you?

263
00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.064
Ms. White?

264
00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.083
Yes.

265
00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:56.860
I believe we have an appointment.

266
00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:58.966
I think you're mistaken.

267
00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:04.160
Four o'clock?

268
00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:07.413
I think there's been
some kind of a mix up.

269
00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:12.360
Well, you answered the door
as though you were expecting someone

270
00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:17.691
and I presume you don't live here
because I was just here two days ago.

271
00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:23.860
So again,
I believe we have an appointment.

272
00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:27.660
I had an appointment, yes.

273
00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:29.260
But with someone my own age.

274
00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:31.760
I get it.
You're expecting Sylvie, your usual?

275
00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:36.060
My what?
Will you come in?

276
00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:39.205
Come in.

277
00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:06.416
Are you from the service?

278
00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:10.560
Oh, Sylvie.

279
00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:13.660
So, this is your first time.

280
00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:16.360
You're nervous.

281
00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.160
It's perfectly natural.

282
00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:23.360
But you don't have to worry.

283
00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:29.560
We will go as slow and easy

284
00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:32.660
as you like.

285
00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:34.660
Look, Miss…

286
00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:36.760
Paris.

287
00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:41.960
Miss Paris, I asked
for someone my own age.

288
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.960
Age is a state of mind, you know?

289
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.460
Maybe for you.

290
00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:49.560
What are you, like 23?

291
00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:52.860
I'm 29.

292
00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:54.060
See what I mean?

293
00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:58.500
You're not what I asked for
and I'm not paying you.

294
00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:03.360
So don't be starting your clock
or whatever it is…

295
00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.560
I am sorry for the misunderstanding

296
00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.260
but the woman
who was supposed to be here

297
00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:11.456
had an emergency
and she asked me to fill in.

298
00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:20.860
I'm not paying you.

299
00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:23.860
I'm not asking you to.

300
00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:28.060
I am just politely
taking my leave.

301
00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:31.290
No hard feelings.

302
00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:44.500
I hope that next time,
you get what you're looking for.

303
00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:39.574
Mom?

304
00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:44.090
What's going on?

305
00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:47.812
Come sit with me.

306
00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:52.813
Just come sit with me
for a minute, will you?

307
00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:09.667
I'm so sorry that I haven't been
a better mother to you.

308
00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:14.460
What's going on with you, mommy?

309
00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:17.637
Going through a midlife crisis
or something?

310
00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:30.560
Are you okay?

311
00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:33.873
Do you have any idea
how much I love you?

312
00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:42.293
If only I had been stronger.

313
00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:46.800
If only I had been there
as I should have been.

314
00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:52.691
I am so sorry,
I should have…

315
00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:56.300
We agreed
not to talk about it.

316
00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:02.360
If we don't talk about it
we'll never get past it.

317
00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.560
Please.

318
00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:08.060
Some things we don't need
to get past, mom, so just…

319
00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:10.560
There must be something I can do.

320
00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:13.000
Not talk about it.
How about that?

321
00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:15.260
I want to do better baby.

322
00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:18.960
I just wanna make it better.
How can I make it better?

323
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.660
Some things you can't fix.

324
00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:23.600
So don't.

325
00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:53.576
Oh, I see.

326
00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.760
Oh, that's pretty cute.

327
00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.802
I like it.

328
00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.260
- Okay, I admit it was for the champagne.
-  Yes? You were there for the champagne?

329
00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:14.000
- Yeah, and the art.
- How was the art?

330
00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:17.500
There was big pictures
and a spotlight.

331
00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:20.400
I was gonna try
make a little tune.

332
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:24.000
[Paris laughs]

333
00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:24.200
Just get me in the mood.
Yes, I'm in love.

334
00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:50.860
I am gifting you these stocks
as part of some estate planning.

335
00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:54.282
Am I clear on that?
Do you understand that?

336
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.131
What?

337
00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:01.360
I am so sick of your greed
and your self-righteous ego.

338
00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:03.145
What?

339
00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:07.360
It was one thing for you
to send the boys to Harvard

340
00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:11.660
'cause I understand you want them
to take over your family business.

341
00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:17.260
And I even let you give a 100,000 shares
of Westridge United to the boys.

342
00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:21.260
Look, we're not gonna have
this conversation. Okay, Rebecca?

343
00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:24.660
You just gonna get upset.
And I'm not gonna change my mind.

344
00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:27.260
Look, I'm just a man, okay?

345
00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:29.760
I'm just the man
that you happened to marry.

346
00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:32.260
And I think on the whole,
I've been pretty good to Jessica.

347
00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:36.660
I mean, she's led
a pretty charmed life.

348
00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:39.160
You owe her, Mason.

349
00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.760
What?

350
00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.916

The problem we all have
with our planning thing

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:27.000
No. Stop watches.

530
00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:31.500
No hatches.

531
00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:34.700
No shifts.

532
00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:50.822
Just…

533
00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:56.476
Lean back.

534
00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:00.300
Relax.

535
00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:02.600
Dad, can I have the Corvette?

536
00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:06.100
Yeah, but you know, you might actually
have to show up to work to get it.

537
00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:20.183
Mom, what's up with you?

538
00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:27.300
Something you want to tell us?

539
00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:29.000
No.

540
00:45:29.227 --> 00:45:31.605
Your wedding ring?

541
00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:33.860
Oh, that.

542
00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:38.560
I left it at the gym today.

543
00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:42.960
I already called.
They've already locked it in their safe.

544
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.860
Damn well better baby,
because that thing is worth a fortune.

545
00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:50.460
Those things are definitely not cheap.

546
00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:54.260
Just wondering if it's worth it.

547
00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:57.400
What, the family you're marrying into?
Are you kidding? And that girl?

548
00:45:57.500 --> 00:45:59.615
Couldn't be better
if I picked it myself.

549
00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:03.900
But you did pick her yourself.

550
00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:11.860
More chicken, Mason?

551
00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:13.260
No, thanks.

552
00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:15.978
No, thank you.

553
00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:24.700
Okay, there is a Jewish guy,
a German guy and a French guy.

554
00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:35.660
I can't.
I'm so sorry I wasted your time.

555
00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:40.400
There is a reason
why you are here.

556
00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:44.818
I can't.

557
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.100
[Sigh]

558
00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:18.160
So you wanted me to get
you something really special

559
00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:19.960
and he wouldn't make up his mind

560
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.900
and it took for ever
and ever and ever, right?

561
00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:25.800
Yeah, I know.
I'm gonna show her in a minute. See…

562
00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:28.860
Well I don't really know
if it's your fault or puppet's fault,

563
00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:31.700
but… I'm angry.

564
00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:35.500
But he wants me to get you this.

565
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:12.500
[Phone]

566
00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:10.600
Okay.

567
00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:13.418
Needed that.

568
00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:17.572
Better to serve you.

569
00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:19.600
Oh, yes.

570
00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:21.860
Oh, yeah, absolutely,

571
00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:25.860
I'll have her wearing the Dorian glasses and…

572
00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:29.759
and she needs to bring the
blowup elephant and the gorilla.

573
00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:35.181
Certainly wouldn't want to bring
the wrong animal.

574
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.060
Great.

575
00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:42.300
Oh, uh, excuse me, may I put
you on hold for a moment?

576
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.360
Better to serve you.

577
00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:48.700
Yes, this is Mistress…
Miss White.

578
00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:50.460
Yes, yes.

579
00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:51.560
Do you have my ring?

580
00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:53.400
I must have left it at the hotel.

581
00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.860
Yes, she said you left that behind.

582
00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:57.760
Ah, good.

583
00:48:57.800 --> 00:48:59.460
No, don't worry.
These things happen.

584
00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:01.660
Can I swing by now and just…

585
00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:04.798
Well, actually,
it's not at the office.

586
00:49:04.838 --> 00:49:07.467
She said that you wanted
to make another appointment

587
00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:12.760
same place but at 7 p.m. and
that she would bring it to you then.

588
00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:13.660
What?

589
00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:16.560
Are you happy
with that arrangement?

590
00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:18.460
Mrs. White?

591
00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:20.300
Are you confirming?

592
00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:23.250
That little bitch.

593
00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:01.300
[Knocking]

594
00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:14.300
Do you have my ring?

595
00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:19.900
Well, may I have it?

596
00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:29.960
Pretty.

597
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.660
It is pretty damn expensive.

598
00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:34.060
And if you think
that I didn't know you had it

599
00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:36.660
and you were just gonna pawn it
then you must think I was born yesterday.

600
00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:41.360
I'm sorry.
You are simply too much.

601
00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:44.560
What's that supposed to mean?

602
00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:48.500
Nothing at all.

603
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:53.000
Wait!

604
00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:55.000
Wait a minute.

605
00:50:56.900 --> 00:51:00.000
Will you come back here?

606
00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:19.260
I'm sorry.

607
00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:22.560
That was unforgivable.

608
00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:24.360
I don't know why I said that.

609
00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:26.660
I had to get my ring back.

610
00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:28.860
You have it

611
00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:29.860
back.

612
00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:32.360
You don't understand.
My husband would kill me!

613
00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:34.660
They'd never understand how
I could lose something so precious.

614
00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:36.900
Precious, value wise?

615
00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:39.500
Precious, meaningful?

616
00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:42.000
It's very valuable.

617
00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:45.500
Meaningful?

618
00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:49.400
Not so much.

619
00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:06.060
I'm sorry.
Would you like one?

620
00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:10.068
Sure. It's been a long day.

621
00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:14.420
How many…?

622
00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:17.104
No shoptalk allowed.

623
00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:20.560
Ms. White

624
00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:25.165
I… It's Rebecca.

625
00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:30.160
And I'll pay you, of course

626
00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:33.438
but I just came back
to get my ring.

627
00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:37.525
No,

628
00:52:37.565 --> 00:52:39.060
you didn't.

629
00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:41.430
Oh, yes, I did, actually.

630
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.100
Do you ever

631
00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:50.500
just stop
and let things

632
00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:53.200
play themselves out?

633
00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:56.788
No, I don't.

634
00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:09.500
Why do you think I'm here?

635
00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:14.000
Nothing

636
00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:16.560
is going to happen

637
00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:21.000
that you don't want.

638
00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:28.460
But, unless you tell me otherwise,

639
00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:34.760
I'm going to kiss you, Rebecca.

640
00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:38.300
That's all.

641
00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:16.400
I'm sorry.

642
00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:21.200
I can't.

643
00:54:36.700 --> 00:54:41.400
You said he signed this all over to you
because of the internal investigation.

644
00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:44.960
REBECCA: He is trying to make sure that
if Westridge Amalgamated

645
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:48.841
has to file bankruptcy,
that Westridge United

646
00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:51.060
won't be affected.

647
00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:53.460
If we proceed with this plan,

648
00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:55.960
you do understand
what you are about to do?

649
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:56.860
Yes.

650
00:54:56.900 --> 00:54:59.160
You will own the voting stock

651
00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:03.069
with monetary value
from Westridge United.

652
00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:06.160
He must trust the shit out of you.

653
00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:08.060
Yes.

654
00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:11.460
He does.

655
00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:13.760
But he'll still be able to be CEO

656
00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:16.560
and maintain his current lifestyle, right?

657
00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:18.060
For the most part.

658
00:55:18.100 --> 00:55:24.560
But as for the rest of the estate
the lion's share of it will be yours

659
00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:27.460
and it will render him…

660
00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:31.500
well, impotent.

661
00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:37.560
Since we have exhausted all
avenues of treatment,

662
00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:40.660
I think it's time
you tell your family and your loved ones.

663
00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:43.060
Once you reach
a certain progression

664
00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:46.560
the symptoms are gonna come on faster.

665
00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:50.860
They're gonna need to be prepared
and as the end grows nearer

666
00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:52.160
you're gonna need help.

667
00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:55.660
I promise I will do everything I can
to keep you as pain-free

668
00:55:55.700 --> 00:56:00.500
and to make this as tolerable
as something like this can be.

669
00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:59.260
I guess dad didn't really
answer the question, did he?

670
00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:01.660
But the only one
who can answer it, is you.

671
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:06.360
- Is it worth it to you?
- Yeah, of course it is.

672
00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:08.810
What about Emily?

673
00:58:08.850 --> 00:58:11.260
You're not in love
with Janice, not like that.

674
00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:17.460
Emily and you are made
for each other, and Janice, she is…

675
00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:21.417
Hey, we have a lot in common.

676
00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:28.600
The only thing you two have in common
is third generation, over indulged wealth.

677
00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:34.560
You don't belong in suits and ties, Ace.

678
00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:36.260
You belong in flip flops and

679
00:58:36.300 --> 00:58:40.500
raggedy ass T-shirts
with really dorky slogans.

680
00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:48.700
So don't do it
unless you're absolutely sure.

681
00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:53.000
It is for the rest of your life.

682
00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:59.000
I just want you to be happy,
that's all.

683
00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:03.619
Just remember it's not too late.

684
00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:15.800
I've got to say, Rebecca,
you've got some balls.

685
00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:22.000
And I mean, some cast-iron,
rock-solid balls, lady.

686
01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:35.000
[Elevator bell - "door is open"]

687
01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:53.700
I…

688
01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:57.200
am at your disposal.

689
01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:19.700
- Where is she already?
- Right.

690
01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:22.700
I don't know.
For mom to miss dinner?

691
01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:25.000
Especially this one.

692
01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:27.194
Did I hear my name?

693
01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:30.860
Oh!

694
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.300
You're not ready.

695
01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:43.000
Janice, I'm so sorry, honey.
Something came up.

696
01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:55.985
Order pizza, and I'll see you all
in a couple of hours.

697
01:07:56.400 --> 01:08:01.360
And Janice, tomorrow night
I'll… sitting arrangements.

698
01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:02.760
I'm, sorry.

699
01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:05.000
Promise.

700
01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:08.400
Tomorrow. Have fun.

701
01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:10.360
Seriously?

702
01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:15.060
Yeah, she knows that
I don't do fake food.

703
01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:16.260
Whatever.

704
01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:20.760
Aaron, I'm gonna need you to call
"Chez sous les meilleurs", okay?

705
01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:22.400
Maybe we could just get pizza?

706
01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:24.700
I'm all for pizza.

707
01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:31.960

I want to know about my mom.

1067
01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:25.660
Okay.

1068
01:45:25.700 --> 01:45:30.060
See, I feel like I've known her
in a very black and white way.

1069
01:45:30.100 --> 01:45:33.560
And I want to know
who she became

1070
01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:35.600
in the end.

1071
01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
And now for Miss Scofield's
center piece…

1072
01:45:42.100 --> 01:45:44.300
What would you like to know?

1073
01:45:47.100 --> 01:45:49.000
"Une petite mort".
