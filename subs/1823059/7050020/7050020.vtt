1
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.800
Yeah, thank you so much.

2
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.600
What do you say?

3
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.860
I want you to fuck me.

4
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.400
Harder.

5
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.160
God, I'm begging you!

6
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.700
A simple "please"
is more than acceptable.

7
00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:57.460
I'm not sure of how or why
these things happen, but they do.

8
00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.260
And to be frank with you,
we have very few options.

9
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:07.000
Sadly, this is one of the times
where medicine lies sorely behind.

10
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.460
Since I'm not
your first consultation,

11
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.260
you know it's my professional duty
to advise you regarding surgery.

12
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.560
But you probably also know

13
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.121
that could yield very little
in prolonging your life.

14
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.298
I'm sorry.

15
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.960
Really, Mason,

16
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.660
is it too much to ask your secretary
to call me, to tell me you canceled lunch?

17
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.460
I'm sorry, Beck.

18
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.000
You said I had to be there
to sign papers.

19
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.960
You know that girl, Susie Clyde,
that you played bridge with?

20
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.560
Listen to me. Do you know
why her husband married her?

21
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.760
Her father owns half of Korea

22
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.660
and her father's got my balls
on a silver platter in fucking China.

23
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.160
Stop it.

24
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.660
First of all, you're talking
about two entirely different countries.

25
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.200
Second, you know I can't stand it,
when you speak about people like that.

26
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.560
Oh, yeah?

27
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.660
I asked you to come down here
so that I can sign

28
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.560
some of these stocks over
and put them in your name.

29
00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.160
So I can get out from underneath
this goddamn audit.

30
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.560
You're not in some kind of trouble,
are you?

31
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.860
We're gonna have to do a little
creative accounting, honey.

32
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.860
And you're gonna have to help.

33
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.060
So, sign the papers and…

34
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.860
I don't know
if I'm gonna be home for dinner.

35
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.400
It's important
that we eat dinner as a family.

36
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.700
It sure as hell is.

37
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.100
Been with a lot of you girls.

38
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.900
Don't know why it is
so much better with you.

39
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.100
Same time next week?

40
00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.460
- Wow, jeans and sneakers.
- Thanks a lot, Hank.

41
00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.160
Someone's a little
bitter they lost.

42
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.000
Grow up.

43
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.260
Loser.

44
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.400
- Grow up.
- Bitter loser.

45
00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.060
I told you, you'd be late
if you played tennis.

46
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.000
There some things
you just can't squeeze in.

47
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.460
I had to get back the money
I lost last night.

48
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.647
Oh, look at you.

49
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.443
I told you:
no more Vegas weekends.

50
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.660
How much?

51
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.960
Would it help if I told you I fell
in love over the whole thing?

52
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.160
You always tell us that
the money can't buy you love.

53
00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.160
Well, except for in Ace's case here.

54
00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.760
Leave Janice out of this.

55
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.660
I think you
should leave Janice out of this.

56
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.160
But then, what the hell
kind of a merger would this be?

57
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.260
Stop it, Hank.

58
00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.060
- Marissa,
- Yes?

59
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.060
Have you seen my calendar?

60
00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:00.160
No, I believe I saw it this morning
in Mr. Mason's office.

61
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.460
Do you want me to go get it?

62
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.060
- Oh, would you mind, please?
- Sure.

63
00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.161
Aaron!

64
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:09.460
Aaron, do you plan
on being late for everything

65
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.560
or only unimportant events
like our engagement party

66
00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.735
that my mother has spent
the last six months planning?

67
00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.460
You'll be very pleased to know, mom,

68
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.360
that I purposely let all that money
slip through my fingers

69
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:26.100
figuring if she still loves me by the time
it's all gone, then maybe she is the one.

70
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.000
No jeans. Go change.

71
00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:36.060
- Here you go, dear.
- Oh, thank you very much.

72
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.160
You need some help here?

73
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.460
Good, good, good
I got it, I got it.

74
00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:40.660
Thank you, Jess.

75
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.360
- You look pretty.
- Thank you.

76
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:47.121
Oh, my god.
We are so late!

77
00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.770
Don't forget to breathe!

78
00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.310
It's one of Valentina's girls.

79
00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:05.660
And so I'm telling you,

80
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.160
she's trying to convince me
to get a nipple ring.

81
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.060
It's gonna make everything
a bit more exciting.

82
00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.760
What is she talking about?
Nipple clamps.

83
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.660
She is just fantastic.

84
00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.260
I'm so out of place here.

85
00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.100
- Don't worry.
- I'll get you a drink.

86
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.336
- I need a drink.
- Okay.

87
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:32.560
Oh, my god.

88
00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:37.060
She is just fantastic.

89
00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:43.860
She tied us together and then she strapped
a dual butterfly between us.

90
00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.760
- Butterfly?
- Oh, a vibrator.

91
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.760
She is amazing. Okay?
I came three times.

92
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:53.660
Then she had to pull me down
from the ceiling.

93
00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.000
No, I'm not kidding.

94
00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.060
So, you're having your ceiling repainted?

95
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.800
Yeah, yeah.

96
00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.860
Well, we've heard
a lot of stories here tonight

97
00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:10.500
and I wanna hear your story.

98
00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.860
- My story?
- Yeah.

99
00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:15.712
Believe me,
I have no story.

100
00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:19.660
Well, you've got to have some story.

101
00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:23.066
I mean, what's your pleasure?
What do you like?

102
00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:27.560
What gets you hot?
You know, your fantasy.

103
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.588
You don't have any answer for that?

104
00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:31.800
No, I'm married.

105
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Oh, Becks.

106
00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.060
Is she playing coy with me?

107
00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:37.960
What is it

108
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.924
that you just simply

109
00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.960
can't resist?

110
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.990
You, evidently.

111
00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.992
It's late, and I would like to take
advantage of this buzz.

112
00:10:51.032 --> 00:10:53.979
Alright, ladies.
That's it for me.

113
00:10:54.019 --> 00:10:56.298
Oh, I like your pants.

114
00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.400
Oh, thank you.

115
00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:04.086
- Ooh, ooh, girl.
- She's very subtle.

116
00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:08.760
A double or like a triple heart bypass.

117
00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.013
Well, you hang in there.

118
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.900
I know in your line of work
time is money.

119
00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:20.401
I'd like to compensate you
for my senior moments.

120
00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:24.676
No worries.

121
00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:45.060
What is it?

122
00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:49.060
I know it when I see it.
When you guys look at each other is…

123
00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:52.960
Even them, tonight.
I felt it.

124
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.560
Oh, god! You could have felt them
in New Jersey, right?

125
00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:04.160
The truth is, we just are lucky.
But we work like hell. Don't we?

126
00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.360
We keep it exciting.

127
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:10.660
Work I can do.
The other part is missing.

128
00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:17.860
Okay, huh…

129
00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:22.400
I'm gonna tell you something
that I've never told anybody.

130
00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:33.060
You know everything that
is to know about me, right?

131
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:36.960
Well…

132
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.460
I've never, ever…

133
00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:46.842
Baby, we know it's not good
between you and asshole.

134
00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:50.060
It's not that, no.

135
00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:51.960
What?

136
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.460
Oh, for God's sake.

137
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:56.418
Come on, out with it.

138
00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.760
I…

139
00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.860
I have never…

140
00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:05.012
You've never come?

141
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.709
Exactly.

142
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.160
Mason?

143
00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.960
He is such a man's man?

144
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.660
We just do it twice a year.

145
00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:34.960
We are both fine with that.

146
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.160
Oh, Becks!

147
00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.360
Oh, you must have to masturbate.

148
00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.060
Don't say that word.

149
00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:43.202
What, "masturbate"?

150
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.287
I've been to a bunch of doctors,

151
00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:49.660
a bunch of therapists.

152
00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:51.760
Something is wrong with me.

153
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.060
What's going on, Rebecca?

154
00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:58.960
I've never once had that
passion in my life.

155
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.560
Damn it.

156
00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.660
Is it so wrong for me to want…

157
00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.360
Come over tonight.

158
00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.860
Have dinner with us
and we'll come up with something.

159
00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.200
I promise.

160
00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:15.000
Am I like your project now?

161
00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.000
Right.
Forget your friggin schedule.

162
00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.482
Just be there at 8:00.

163
00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:28.393
You know what?

164
00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.000
What you need is a vibrator.

165
00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.000
No. That gives me the willies.

166
00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.499
I know, weed.
Let's get her stoned.

167
00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.560
No, I don't do drugs.

168
00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.260
No, I do know.

169
00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:44.107
I think you should seriously consider
taking a lover.

170
00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.900
That is, if you don't mind
breaking your vows.

171
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.300
No moral quandary there,
believe me, but…

172
00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:53.000
What am I supposed to do?
Just go to some guy in the street?

173
00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.860
No, no.
I mean a woman.

174
00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:57.120
What?

175
00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:58.860
A woman lover.

176
00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:00.460
Oh, come on.

177
00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:03.960
Just hear me out
and do not listen to her, okay?

178
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.060
A woman is so much more
familiar with the manual.

179
00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.360
Who?

180
00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.560
Wait.

181
00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:13.060
I'm talking about a woman, you know,
who has all kinds of tricks up her sleeves,

182
00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.960
who's used to particular situations…

183
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:16.960
And as it happens,

184
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.360
I happen to have a second cousin
who runs this service business,

185
00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.560
and she could get you
hooked up.

186
00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.188
Service business?

187
00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:29.000
Kind of the dark sheep of the family.

188
00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:34.400
Valentina has got
the finest women I have ever seen.

189
00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:36.500
Smoking.

190
00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.400
Hey, hey, hey. Settle.

191
00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.000
Oh, my god.

192
00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.461
No one will ever find out.

193
00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.645
I thought that was just for men.

194
00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:47.062
Are you kidding me?

195
00:16:47.102 --> 00:16:49.860
I mean, women actually do that?

196
00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:50.860
Oh, of course.

197
00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:54.860
You have to think of this
as an experiment, okay?

198
00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:56.760
It hasn't happened with a schlong.

199
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.100
You are hiring her for a service.
A very specific service.

200
00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.500
No, no, no. That's fine.
Nothing is too odd for us.

201
00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:09.360
What have you got to lose?

202
00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.400
Not a lot at this point.

203
00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:24.160
Better to serve you.

204
00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.860
Oh, hi, Shirin.

205
00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:30.800
No, no, I'm sure
we can find someone for her.

206
00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:34.600
Fine. Consider it taken care of.

207
00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:46.160
Okay. This one should be fun.
Feel like educating?

208
00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.560
Oh, yeah.
What do you got, a virgin boy?

209
00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:49.760
Calm down, cougar.

210
00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:53.700
No, this is a housewife from the burbs
looking for a new adventure.

211
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.100
Just a little Latin now.

212
00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.800
Just a little singing, we…

213
00:17:58.600 --> 00:17:59.600
Shut the fuck up!

214
00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.360
I am speaking to an employee.

215
00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:06.360
Sylvie, look, this is a friend
of my cousin's, okay?

216
00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.560
She's never been
with a woman before

217
00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.700
but my lesbian cousin has explained to her
that women make better lovers.

218
00:18:11.748 --> 00:18:13.700
Yeah. Tell me something
I don't know.

219
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.260
And she's from money.

220
00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:17.460
So I want this to go really well.

221
00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:18.960
Just think
of all the referrals I could get

222
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.200
from that upper crust stuffy
country club set of hers.

223
00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:25.460
So I want you
to do right by her, alright?

224
00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:29.160
And besides, she wanted
someone closer to her own age.

225
00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.660
Sorry.

226
00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:32.160
Now sing.

227
00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.800
I wanna feel this moment

228
00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.260
though I can't control it

229
00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:40.700
if it's all I ever do.

230
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.960
That's what I'm going in with
for my audition.

231
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.400
And then, when I cut my single,
I'm done with all of this.

232
00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.060
And what happened
to your other hits?

233
00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:49.460
Sylvie, play nice.

234
00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:53.460
Now, I handpicked you for this
and I don't want you to disappoint me.

235
00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:58.200
Sylvie, don't be late.
I hear she's a stickler for time.

236
00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:01.060
You know how much I hate
to ask you to take a call but it's Molly.

237
00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:03.760
She's invited me
to her fiance's parents house

238
00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:06.160
so it's a big fuck deal.

239
00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.100
I gotta go, okay?

240
00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:12.060
Client is fully vetted,
handpicked by Valentina,

241
00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:16.760
so crème de la crème,
all the good stuff, right?

242
00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.260
Oh, sweetheart, I love you.
Christ, I love you.

243
00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:20.460
Oh, fuck!
I almost forgot!

244
00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:25.000
The client is a real stickler for time
so don't be late, alright?

245
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.514
Oh, shit.

246
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.225
This is insane.

247
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.021
What am I doing?

248
00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.360
May I help you?

249
00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.064
Ms. White?

250
00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:13.083
Yes.

251
00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:16.860
I believe we have an appointment.

252
00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:18.966
I think you're mistaken.

253
00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:24.160
Four o'clock?

254
00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:27.413
I think there's been
some kind of a mix-up.

255
00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:32.360
Well, you answered the door
as though you were expecting someone

256
00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:37.691
and I presume you don't live here
because I was just here two days ago.

257
00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:43.860
So again,
I believe we have an appointment.

258
00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:47.660
I had an appointment, yes.

259
00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:49.260
But with someone my own age.

260
00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.760
I get it.
You're expecting Sylvie, your usual?

261
00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:56.060
My what?
Will you come in?

262
00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:59.205
Come in.

263
00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:26.416
Are you from the service?

264
00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:30.560
Oh, Sylvie.

265
00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.660
So, this is your first time.

266
00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:36.360
You're nervous.

267
00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.160
It's perfectly natural.

268
00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:43.360
But you don't have to worry.

269
00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:49.560
We will go as slow and easy

270
00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:52.660
as you like.

271
00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:54.660
Look, Miss…

272
00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:56.760
Paris.

273
00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:01.960
Miss Paris, I asked
for someone my own age.

274
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.960
Age is a state of mind, you know?

275
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.460
Maybe for you.

276
00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:09.560
What are you, like 23?

277
00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:12.860
I'm 29.

278
00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:14.060
See what I mean?

279
00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:18.500
You're not what I asked for
and I'm not paying you.

280
00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:23.360
So don't be starting your clock
or whatever it is…

281
00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.560
I am sorry for the misunderstanding

282
00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.260
but the woman
who was supposed to be here

283
00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:31.456
had an emergency
and she asked me to fill in.

284
00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:40.860
I'm not paying you.

285
00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.860
I'm not asking you to.

286
00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:48.060
I am just politely
taking my leave.

287
00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:51.290
No hard feelings.

288
00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:04.500
I hope that next time,
you get what you're looking for.

289
00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:59.574
Mom?

290
00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.090
What's going on?

291
00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:07.812
Come sit with me.

292
00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.813
Just come sit with me
for a minute, will you?

293
00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:29.667
I'm so sorry that I haven't been
a better mother to you.

294
00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.460
What's going on with you, mommy?

295
00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:37.637
Going through a midlife crisis
or something?

296
00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.560
Are you okay?

297
00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:53.873
Do you have any idea
how much I love you?

298
00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:02.293
If only I had been stronger.

299
00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:06.800
If only I had been there
as I should have been.

300
00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:12.691
I am so sorry,
I should have…

301
00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:16.300
We agreed
not to talk about it.

302
00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:22.360
If we don't talk about it
we'll never get past it.

303
00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:24.560
Please.

304
00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:28.060
Some things we don't need
to get past, mom, so just…

305
00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:30.560
There must be something I can do.

306
00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:33.000
Not talk about it.
How about that?

307
00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:35.260
I want to do better baby.

308
00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:38.960
I just wanna make it better.
How can I make it better?

309
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.660
Some things you can't fix.

310
00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.600
So don't.

311
00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:13.576
Oh, I see.

312
00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.760
Oh, that's pretty cute.

313
00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.802
I like it.

314
00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:30.260
- Okay, I admit it was for the champagne.
- Yes? You were there for the champagne?

315
00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:34.000
- Yeah, and the art.
- How was the art?

316
00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:37.500
There was big pictures
and a spotlight.

317
00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:40.400
I was gonna try
make a little tune.

318
00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:44.200
Just get me in the mood.
Yes, I'm in love.

319
00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:10.860
I am gifting you these stocks
as part of some estate planning.

320
00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:14.282
Am I clear on that?
Do you understand that?

321
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.131
What?

322
00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:21.360
I am so sick of your greed
and your self-righteous ego.

323
00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:23.145
What?

324
00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:27.360
It was one thing for you
to send the boys to Harvard

325
00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:31.660
'cause I understand you want them
to take over your family business.

326
00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:37.260
And I even let you give a 100,000 shares
of Westridge United to the boys.

327
00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:41.260
Look, we're not gonna have
this conversation. Okay, Rebecca?

328
00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:44.660
You just gonna get upset.
And I'm not gonna change my mind.

329
00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:47.260
Look, I'm just a man, okay?

330
00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:49.760
I'm just the man
that you happened to marry.

331
00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.260
And I think on the whole,
I've been pretty good to Jessica.

332
00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:56.660
I mean, she's led
a pretty charmed life.

333
00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:59.160
You owe her, Mason.

334
00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.760
What?

335
00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.916
Not that shit again.

336
00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:07.148
Not that again!

337
00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:11.560
Goddamn!
It was one fucking night!

338
00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:15.490
One night!

339
00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:19.500
I'm not giving her stocks
in this business. You get it?

340
00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:24.160
This business has been
in my family for 100 years

341
00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:28.460
and that was the deal between
you and me, right from the start.

342
00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:30.160
I love her.

343
00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:33.660
She's not my blood,
the boys are.

344
00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:38.260
You can say I'm cold hearted,
but she's not mine.

345
00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:40.760
For god's sake,
will you wake up?

346
00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:42.560
This isn't some kind
of a monarchy.

347
00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:46.560
You're the only father
she has ever known.

348
00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.060
What do you think
this is gonna do to her?

349
00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:50.860
She already feels
like a second class citizen.

350
00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:53.660
You say to her whatever
you want to say, Beck.

351
00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:56.060
I'm not gonna change my mind.

352
00:28:56.100 --> 00:29:01.876
I'm going to bed now.
Don't bother joining me.

353
00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:48.960
Alright.

354
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000
Hey.

355
00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:57.000
Hey, Dad.

356
00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.000
That's it.
Only once.

357
00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:28.960
We just came from this place, alright?

358
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.660
That won't help.

359
00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:31.927
Are you crazy?

360
00:30:31.967 --> 00:30:33.755
Don't make me mad.

361
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.279
You're totally getting us lost.

362
00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.700
So, we're fucking dying here, god.

363
00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:12.760
Come on!

364
00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:16.360
Tell everything.

365
00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:18.800
Nothing.

366
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.600
Nothing happened.

367
00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:24.900
I was just so thrown for a loop. Oh.

368
00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:26.860
Masterplan.

369
00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:30.200
The problem we all have
with our planning thing

370
00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:34.667
is that it can't prepare you
for anything, can it?

371
00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:39.160
For some unforeseen obstacle,
like some

372
00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:41.660
she-devil coming through the door

373
00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:46.460
instead of someone like me.

374
00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:48.500
What is the big deal?

375
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.700
Just try again.

376
00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:48.060
Better to serve you.

377
00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:50.869
Oh, yes, Ms. White.

378
00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:57.300
So, let me get this straight.
You want the same person you had last time.

379
00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:58.760
Yes.

380
00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:01.800
And you want exactly
the same location.

381
00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:03.600
Yes.

382
00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:06.700
Consider it done.

383
00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:13.922
Okay, Sylvie.

384
00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:42.631
Oh. Well, that's enough
to hurt a girls ego.

385
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.231
If she gave a shit.

386
00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:01.360
I don't know
what I was expecting.

387
00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:02.960
It's okay.

388
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.860
Valentina knows that
there's not a filly that I can't break.

389
00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:09.560
So let's get down to business,
shall we?

390
00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:11.960
I have dildos, you can strap on,

391
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.860
we can swap,
we can double 69.

392
00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:19.160
Fingers are fine, if you prefer
but just two or three.

393
00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:22.160
No fisting
'cause I have a cyst.

394
00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:27.460
But if you want the best
thing for your buck we can ecstabang.

395
00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:29.360
Ecsta… what?

396
00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.160
Ecstabang.

397
00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:33.760
We do some ecstasy,
then each other.

398
00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:36.960
It's so fucking sweet.

399
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.200
That's not gonna happen.

400
00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:50.410
I know who you are.

401
00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:53.000
It's you, you're the one
who was with Paris,

402
00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:56.300
The one with the redwood stick up here.

403
00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.900
Doris Day ass. Wow.

404
00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:08.560
So… What did the two of you do
if you don't mind me asking?

405
00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.660
Look,

406
00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:16.300
I don't know what she told you, but
nothing happened with that other girl.

407
00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:18.560
Paris is a woman.

408
00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:20.400
Don't be underestimating her.

409
00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:22.960
I wasn't doing any such thing.
I don't know her.

410
00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.460
I don't wanna know her.

411
00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:28.360
Look, I'm sure you all
watch out for each other,

412
00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:31.760
and that's just great.

413
00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:35.660
But as a paying customer,
I'm used to getting exactly what I order.

414
00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:38.460
God, she was right about you.

415
00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:41.688
Really?

416
00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:49.860
What did she say?

417
00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:53.660
She's rather poetic, Paris.

418
00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:56.000
She said that you were bitter -

419
00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.200
sweet.

420
00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:05.800
Well, this obviously
isn't working, so

421
00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:09.660
I think it's time
for you to go now.

422
00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:15.760
All you, junior league little Stepford wives
are all exactly the same.

423
00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:20.860
Toughest part of your day is trying to
figure out where to seat Mrs. Weatherby

424
00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:24.100
at the shmuckety fuck fundraiser, right?

425
00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:39.160
Oh, you're really in the deep, are you.

426
00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:44.460
Big what-if every morning
with your bran muffin

427
00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:48.260
Tic-tac…

428
00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:51.060
Wrong side of the clock.

429
00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:57.260
I bet there's a half-empty bottle
of booze in your panty drawer

430
00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:01.000
right next to that worn out 45
of "Qué Será Será"

431
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000
Will I be pretty…

432
00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:11.000
or will I just be.

433
00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:16.460
This was such a huge mistake.

434
00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:20.160
What the hell do you think
actually separates us anyway?

435
00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:24.482
Paris and I don't answer to anyone.

436
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.660
Fucking no one.

437
00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:29.500
How about you?

438
00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:33.060
Get out.

439
00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:35.260
Sorry, I didn't mean to make you
wet your pants, I just…

440
00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:37.660
I said get out!

441
00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:41.560
Now, you are obviously
looking for something

442
00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:43.660
I hope you fucking find it.

443
00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:47.944
And when you do… commit.

444
00:37:57.100 --> 00:38:00.620
Think about it.

445
00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:13.660
Why now?

446
00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:16.660
We know that we could remotely
understand what you saw in Mason.

447
00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:18.860
I mean we thought
you loved him, right?

448
00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:23.560
As a secretary with a 2-year-old strapped
to my hip, Mason looked pretty good.

449
00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:25.360
Okay, I get it.

450
00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:27.960
Security counts for a lot,
when you have a baby

451
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.360
but it's not like owning a dog.

452
00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:30.560
That's what I'm saying.

453
00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:32.460
You'll make such a good mommy,
I mean…

454
00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:36.260
You just want to get me knocked up
'cause you think it'll stop me cursing, right?

455
00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:39.800
- It'll stop you drinking.
- Yeah, yeah, I was told that.

456
00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:41.605
You two are so lucky.

457
00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:45.160
What's it like?

458
00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:47.812
On the level?

459
00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:53.460
Being in love with Kelly

460
00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:59.660
is sanguine,

461
00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:01.308
erotic,

462
00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:04.257
delicious,

463
00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:06.700
magical.

464
00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.860
Downright mystical.

465
00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:12.500
But you know,
these are just words, you know?

466
00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:17.360
I mean them.
But I really want you to feel it.

467
00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:19.600
That was the plan.

468
00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:24.000
You asked for this - this thing.
Don't let this bitch stop you.

469
00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:27.560
You ask for this - this Paris
by name next time.

470
00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:31.160
But I'm serious, Becks, don't spend
the rest of your life settling.

471
00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:32.500
Don't do it.

472
00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:39.560
I'd like to thank you for coming.

473
00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:43.960
Third time a charm?

474
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.160
I'm a little out
of my comfort zone here.

475
00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:50.160
You do that a lot.

476
00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:52.560
What?

477
00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:55.560
Check the time.

478
00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:58.900
Don't worry.
You'll get your moneys worth.

479
00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:00.500
That's…

480
00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:05.178
Good one.

481
00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:06.654
Funny.

482
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.724
Would you like a drink?

483
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.300
No. But go ahead.

484
00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.200
You don't drink?

485
00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:26.360
I thought it sort of
came with the territory.

486
00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:32.900
I like to concentrate on the details,
try not to get too fuzzy.

487
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.860
You take your work very seriously.

488
00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:37.500
Yes, I do.

489
00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:49.560
So,

490
00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:52.700
what can I do for you?

491
00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:18.600
Have you done this with men?

492
00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:21.700
This? No.

493
00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:25.500
Are you a lesbian?

494
00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:29.300
Oh, god, no. I… Oh!

495
00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:34.160
For some reason,
I just thought that

496
00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:37.350
somehow this might be easier
with a woman.

497
00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:47.100
I wanna know what passion is.

498
00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:51.540
I wanna know
what an orgasm feels like.

499
00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:58.400
Well, they are two
distinctly different goals.

500
00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:07.125
It'll be whatever you want

501
00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:10.400
or need.

502
00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:16.536
But I think you should be clear.

503
00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:23.800
An orgasm is a physical phenomenon

504
00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:28.684
and that, I can help you with.

505
00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:37.500
Passion, is another thing entirely.

506
00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:47.000
No. Stop watches.

507
00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:51.500
No hatches.

508
00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:54.700
No shifts.

509
00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:10.822
Just…

510
00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:16.476
Lean back.

511
00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:20.300
Relax.

512
00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:22.600
Dad, can I have the Corvette?

513
00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:26.100
Yeah, but you know, you might actually
have to show up to work to get it.

514
00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:40.183
Mom, what's up with you?

515
00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:47.300
Something you want to tell us?

516
00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:49.000
No.

517
00:45:49.227 --> 00:45:51.605
Your wedding ring?

518
00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:53.860
Oh, that.

519
00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:58.560
I left it at the gym today.

520
00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:02.960
I already called.
They've already locked it in their safe.

521
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.860
Damn well better baby,
because that thing is worth a fortune.

522
00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:10.460
Those things are definitely not cheap.

523
00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:14.260
Just wondering if it's worth it.

524
00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:17.400
What, the family you're marrying into?
Are you kidding? And that girl?

525
00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:19.615
Couldn't be better
if I picked it myself.

526
00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:23.900
But you did pick her yourself.

527
00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:31.860
More chicken, Mason?

528
00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:33.260
No, thanks.

529
00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:35.978
No, thank you.

530
00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:44.700
Okay, there is a Jewish guy,
a German guy and a French guy.

531
00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:55.660
I can't.
I'm so sorry I wasted your time.

532
00:46:55.700 --> 00:47:00.400
There is a reason
why you are here.

533
00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:04.818
I can't.

534
00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:38.160
So you wanted me to get
you something really special

535
00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:39.960
and he wouldn't make up his mind

536
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.900
and it took for ever
and ever and ever, right?

537
00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:45.800
Yeah, I know.
I'm gonna show her in a minute. See…

538
00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:48.860
Well I don't really know
if it's your fault or puppet's fault,

539
00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:51.700
but… I'm angry.

540
00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:55.500
But he wants me to get you this.

541
00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:30.600
Okay.

542
00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:33.418
Needed that.

543
00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:37.572
Better to serve you.

544
00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:39.600
Oh, yes.

545
00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:41.860
Oh, yeah, absolutely,

546
00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:45.860
I'll have her wearing the Dorian glasses and…

547
00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:49.759
and she needs to bring the
blowup elephant and the gorilla.

548
00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:55.181
Certainly wouldn't want to bring
the wrong animal.

549
00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:00.060
Great.

550
00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:02.300
Oh, uh, excuse me, may I put
you on hold for a moment?

551
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.360
Better to serve you.

552
00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:08.700
Yes, this is Mistress…
Miss White.

553
00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:10.460
Yes, yes.

554
00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:11.560
Do you have my ring?

555
00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:13.400
I must have left it at the hotel.

556
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.860
Yes, she said you left that behind.

557
00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:17.760
Ah, good.

558
00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:19.460
No, don't worry.
These things happen.

559
00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:21.660
Can I swing by now and just…

560
00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:24.798
Well, actually,
it's not at the office.

561
00:49:24.838 --> 00:49:27.467
She said that you wanted
to make another appointment

562
00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:32.760
same place but at 7 p.m. and
that she would bring it to you then.

563
00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:33.660
What?

564
00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:36.560
Are you happy
with that arrangement?

565
00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:38.460
Mrs. White?

566
00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.300
Are you confirming?

567
00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:43.250
That little bitch.

568
00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:34.300
Do you have my ring?

569
00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:39.900
Well, may I have it?

570
00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:49.960
Pretty.

571
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.660
It is pretty damn expensive.

572
00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:54.060
And if you think
that I didn't know you had it

573
00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:56.660
and you were just gonna pawn it
then you must think I was born yesterday.

574
00:50:56.700 --> 00:51:01.360
I'm sorry.
You are simply too much.

575
00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:04.560
What's that supposed to mean?

576
00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:08.500
Nothing at all.

577
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.000
Wait!

578
00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:15.000
Wait a minute.

579
00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:20.000
Will you come back here?

580
00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:39.260
I'm sorry.

581
00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:42.560
That was unforgivable.

582
00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:44.360
I don't know why I said that.

583
00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:46.660
I had to get my ring back.

584
00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:48.860
You have it

585
00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:49.860
back.

586
00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:52.360
You don't understand.
My husband would kill me!

587
00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:54.900
They'd never understand how
I could lose something so precious.

588
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:56.900
Precious, value wise?

589
00:51:57.300 --> 00:51:59.500
Precious, meaningful?

590
00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:02.000
It's very valuable.

591
00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:05.500
Meaningful?

592
00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:09.400
Not so much.

593
00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:26.060
I'm sorry.
Would you like one?

594
00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:30.068
Sure. It's been a long day.

595
00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:34.420
How many…?

596
00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:37.104
No shoptalk allowed.

597
00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:40.560
Ms. White

598
00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:45.165
I… It's Rebecca.

599
00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:50.160
And I'll pay you, of course

600
00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:53.438
but I just came back
to get my ring.

601
00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:57.525
No,

602
00:52:57.565 --> 00:52:59.060
you didn't.

603
00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:01.430
Oh, yes, I did, actually.

604
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.100
Do you ever

605
00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:10.500
just stop
and let things

606
00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:13.200
play themselves out?

607
00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:16.788
No, I don't.

608
00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:29.500
Why do you think I'm here?

609
00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:34.000
Nothing

610
00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:36.560
is going to happen

611
00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:41.000
that you don't want.

612
00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:48.460
But, unless you tell me otherwise,

613
00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:54.760
I'm going to kiss you, Rebecca.

614
00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:58.300
That's all.

615
00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:36.400
I'm sorry.

616
00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:41.200
I can't.

617
00:54:56.700 --> 00:55:01.400
You said he signed this all over to you
because of the internal investigation.

618
00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:04.960
He is trying to make sure that
if Westridge Amalgamated

619
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.841
has to file bankruptcy,
that Westridge United

620
00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:11.060
won't be affected.

621
00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:13.460
If we proceed with this plan,

622
00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:15.960
you do understand
what you are about to do?

623
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:16.860
Yes.

624
00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:19.160
You will own the voting stock

625
00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:23.069
with monetary value
from Westridge United.

626
00:55:23.109 --> 00:55:26.160
He must trust the shit out of you.

627
00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:28.060
Yes.

628
00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:31.460
He does.

629
00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:33.760
But he'll still be able to be CEO

630
00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:36.560
and maintain his current lifestyle, right?

631
00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:38.060
For the most part.

632
00:55:38.100 --> 00:55:44.560
But as for the rest of the estate
the lion's share of it will be yours

633
00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:47.460
and it will render him…

634
00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:51.500
well, impotent.

635
00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:57.560
Since we have exhausted all
avenues of treatment,

636
00:55:57.600 --> 00:56:00.660
I think it's time
you tell your family and your loved ones.

637
00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:03.060
Once you reach
a certain progression

638
00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:06.560
the symptoms are gonna come on faster.

639
00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:10.860
They're gonna need to be prepared
and as the end grows nearer

640
00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:12.160
you're gonna need help.

641
00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:15.660
I promise I will do everything I can
to keep you as pain-free

642
00:56:15.700 --> 00:56:20.500
and to make this as tolerable
as something like this can be.

643
00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:19.260
I guess dad didn't really
answer the question, did he?

644
00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:21.660
But the only one
who can answer it, is you.

645
00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:26.360
- Is it worth it to you?
- Yeah, of course it is.

646
00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:28.810
What about Emily?

647
00:58:28.850 --> 00:58:31.260
You're not in love
with Janice, not like that.

648
00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:37.460
Emily and you are made
for each other, and Janice, she is…

649
00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:41.417
Hey, we have a lot in common.

650
00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:48.600
The only thing you two have in common
is third generation, over indulged wealth.

651
00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:54.560
You don't belong in suits and ties, Ace.

652
00:58:54.600 --> 00:58:56.260
You belong in flip flops and

653
00:58:56.300 --> 00:59:00.500
raggedy ass T-shirts
with really dorky slogans.

654
00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:08.700
So don't do it
unless you're absolutely sure.

655
00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:13.000
It is for the rest of your life.

656
00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:19.000
I just want you to be happy,
that's all.

657
00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:23.619
Just remember it's not too late.

658
00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:35.800
I've got to say, Rebecca,
you've got some balls.

659
00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:42.000
And I mean, some cast-iron,
rock-solid balls, lady.

660
01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:13.700
I…

661
01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:17.200
am at your disposal.

662
01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:39.700
- Where is she already?
- Right.

663
01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:42.700
I don't know.
For mom to miss dinner?

664
01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:45.000
Especially this one.

665
01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:47.194
Did I hear my name?

666
01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:50.860
Oh!

667
01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.300
You're not ready.

668
01:07:57.900 --> 01:08:03.000
Janice, I'm so sorry, honey.
Something came up.

669
01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:15.985
Order pizza, and I'll see you all
in a couple of hours.

670
01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:21.360
And Janice, tomorrow night
I'll… sitting arrangements.

671
01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:22.760
I'm, sorry.

672
01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:25.000
Promise.

673
01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:28.400
Tomorrow. Have fun.

674
01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:30.360
Seriously?

675
01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:35.060
Yeah, she knows that
I don't do fake food.

676
01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:36.260
Whatever.

677
01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:40.760
Aaron, I'm gonna need you to call
"Chez sous les meilleurs", okay?

678
01:08:40.900 --> 01:08:42.400
Maybe we could just get pizza?

679
01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:44.700
I'm all for pizza.

680
01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:51.960
No. And order me
Épinards et Concombres à la grecque

681
01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.500
with a side of focaccia, okay?

682
01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:58.460
'Cause I need my protein and
I would still like to fit into my Vera Wang.

683
01:08:58.500 --> 01:08:59.600
I have to go make a call.

684
01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:00.700
Bye, sweetheart.

685
01:09:00.900 --> 01:09:04.000
Yeah, Aaron, I'd like some of that
"fuckaccia" bread too, please.

686
01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:05.900
Fuck you.

687
01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:08.000
Wow, Aaron.

688
01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:11.560
So what was that?

689
01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:13.600
Spinach salad.

690
01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:16.100
I'm not talking about crazy,
I'm talking about mom.

691
01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:17.260
That was weird.

692
01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:18.400
- Super weird.
- Yeah.

693
01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:20.600
She was frazzled.

694
01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:25.936
Well, you and the diva
are gonna be so happy together.

695
01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:31.900
Pizza!

696
01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:44.460
No, I hate my stomach.

697
01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:47.203
I haven't been to the gym
in way too long.

698
01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:54.400
I used to have a pretty good body
before kids and menopause.

699
01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:01.400
I never looked like you, though.

700
01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:06.636
This doesn't mean anything.

701
01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:09.175
Rebecca.

702
01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:17.095
I hate that I did this.

703
01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:21.049
Why did you?

704
01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:25.000
It was a birthday present

705
01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:28.500
from Mason.

706
01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:33.100
He loves perfection.

707
01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:37.700
Sort of the one thing
we have in common.

708
01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:42.200
I've spent my whole life
trying to be perfect.

709
01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.600
I never felt

710
01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:52.700
good enough or

711
01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:55.200
thin enough,

712
01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:58.500
pretty enough,

713
01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:02.200
smart enough.

714
01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:09.695
All the things

715
01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:14.914
that make us not perfect

716
01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:23.200
are what make us
so perfectly who we are.

717
01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:28.900
That's who you are,
Rebecca.

718
01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:34.460
Per -

719
01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:36.600
fec -

720
01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:38.000
tion.

721
01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:44.600
You make me feel that way,

722
01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:49.693
my beautiful girl.

723
01:11:56.200 --> 01:12:00.089
- It's official.
- She popped.

724
01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:03.700
She looks like she's 26

725
01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:05.300
How dare you?

726
01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:09.529
It's so exquisite.

727
01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:19.600
Well, I am sextonished.

728
01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.460
Okay, okay.

729
01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:24.100
I'm so glad that's gone.

730
01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:26.500
I was not a fan.

731
01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:29.360
You totally corrupted me.

732
01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:30.860
I hope you're proud of yourself

733
01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:33.600
Well, I feel like
I deserve a glow.

734
01:12:33.700 --> 01:12:34.960
It's so bad.

735
01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.960
We took our little girl to school,
and she got an A in muff diving.

736
01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.200
Awesome.

737
01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:06.800
You know we totally love you,
but you always had a redwood up your ass.

738
01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:10.600
I think what little miss humble
is trying to say, Becks, is that

739
01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.360
we just couldn't be more thrilled.

740
01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:15.290
Thank you.

741
01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:17.660
I think you'd like my kids.

742
01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:20.000
Jessica is my first love.

743
01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:23.860
I have Hank an Aaron…

744
01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:27.400
obviously Mason was a
Hank Aaron baseball fan.

745
01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:30.260
Byron is one of my favorite poets.

746
01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:32.120
Read to me, please.

747
01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.660
"Do go and ask Maude to come up here"

748
01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:37.860
"it probably never occurred to her"

749
01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:40.560
"Dear me, this act is over"

750
01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:43.453
"Our little secret, Maude."

751
01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.457
Really?

752
01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:57.200
So where does this
possibly go from here?

753
01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:00.000
I don't care.

754
01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Really.

755
01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:03.460
For the first time ever

756
01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:05.960
I am not trying
to cram it in for a reason

757
01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.560
or squeeze it in
because I have to.

758
01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:14.869
I'm just gonna
enjoy every last moment.

759
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.460
Oh, my god!

760
01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:50.360
What?

761
01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:52.798
I missed dinner,
I didn't even call.

762
01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:58.860
- Just stop.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

763
01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:02.000
And just… before you leave, I…

764
01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:10.863
That was so amazing.

765
01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:16.150
Oh, I am in love with your mouth.

766
01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:20.960
They're gonna be worried sick.

767
01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.038
Thank you, Paris.

768
01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:25.339
Thank you.

769
01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:42.660
It's not like mom not to call.
I'm starting to get a little worried.

770
01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:46.100
Yes, she never misses family dinner.

771
01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:50.460
Maybe they're together.

772
01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:54.400
You know, figuring out
how to tell us and what to do.

773
01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:56.460
So, are we just supposed
to act like we don't know?

774
01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:59.460
Yes, I think we should.
So don't say anything to mom

775
01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:02.260
or dad until they tell us.

776
01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:04.400
Alright.

777
01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:13.060
Sorry.

778
01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:20.660
I got stuck in the worst freeway accident
and my cellphone went dead.

779
01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:22.460
I…

780
01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:26.800
- Dad is not with you?
- No.

781
01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:35.400
- Why? He's not here?
- No, and we all know why.

782
01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:42.000
You all know, what?

783
01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:44.060
Wait.

784
01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.600
Give it to me.

785
01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:49.000
What?

786
01:17:08.900 --> 01:17:11.200
Now, let's not jump to conclusions.

787
01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:13.900
This isn't jumping, mom.

788
01:17:14.100 --> 01:17:18.260
I was in dad's office before I left tonight
trying to find a document for tomorrow.

789
01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:20.360
I went through his desk,
I found this.

790
01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:22.860
I know I shouldn't have, but…

791
01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:25.200
He's been having all
this trouble working.

792
01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:27.960
Whoever is trying to turn his company
upside down is succeeding.

793
01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:31.600
And you know, that's what I thought it was.
I thought all the late nights was…

794
01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:34.360
Yeah, his temper,
all the drinking…

795
01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:36.360
Well, Mom, you know.

796
01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:39.260
Everybody let's just remain calm.

797
01:17:39.300 --> 01:17:42.860
I need you to listen
to me very carefully.

798
01:17:42.900 --> 01:17:45.060
You are not
to say a word.

799
01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:46.060
What?

800
01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:47.260
Did you know?

801
01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:50.360
You're not to say a word
and I mean it.

802
01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:51.760
I will talk to your father and…

803
01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:53.700
Right, cause you talk about everything.

804
01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:57.360
You will not breathe a word until
I've spoken with him. Is that clear?

805
01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:58.700
Sure.

806
01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:04.000
This is gonna change everything!

807
01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:07.553
You're right.

808
01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:11.454
It will.

809
01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:03.600
How long have you known?

810
01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:06.400
What?

811
01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:18.360
What are you talking about?

812
01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:21.000
How long have you known?

813
01:19:24.900 --> 01:19:27.995
I've known for the past few weeks.

814
01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:32.700
I went to see Dr. Weller.

815
01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:39.260
Rebecca, do you know what this means?

816
01:19:39.300 --> 01:19:42.060
I mean, for us,
for the family, for the kids,

817
01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:44.541
the company, for Christ sake.

818
01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:48.794
I think I do.

819
01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:52.866
So, yeah, then,
well…

820
01:19:54.300 --> 01:19:57.253
We're gonna fix it then, right?

821
01:19:58.500 --> 01:20:00.505
We're gonna fix it.

822
01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:03.057
We'll fix it
before it's too late.

823
01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:21.000
I hope you believe me
and understand

824
01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:26.260
when I say I am so sorry.

825
01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:35.838
I am truly sorry, Mason.

826
01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:40.300
But I think we both know

827
01:20:41.700 --> 01:20:45.400
It's already too late.

828
01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:07.160
He said it's cancer,
and it's metastasized

829
01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:09.060
I can't believe this.

830
01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:11.360
Honey, are you sure?

831
01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:13.760
Yeah.

832
01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:15.260
What do you need from us?

833
01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:18.660
To help me keep it together
for them right now.

834
01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:21.892
Okay.

835
01:21:27.100 --> 01:21:29.700
How do you do this
with so many people?

836
01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:33.806
Strangers.

837
01:21:33.846 --> 01:21:37.711
I don't "do" this.

838
01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:46.460
I know you don't like me digging,
but can't you make a living another way?

839
01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:47.660
I mean, look at you.

840
01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:52.960
Seriously. You are gorgeous,
you are smart, you are assured…

841
01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.260
Why this?

842
01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:58.600
I clear over $200,000 a year.

843
01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.700
I make my own schedule

844
01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:04.160
and I get to give back.

845
01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:06.160
Give back?

846
01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:08.360
Give back?

847
01:22:08.900 --> 01:22:10.460
I'm a little lost here.

848
01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:11.660
Nothing.

849
01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:13.260
No. What do you mean?

850
01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:15.400
I wanna know why you do this.

851
01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:17.400
Why are you here?

852
01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:20.900
I wanna know you.

853
01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:30.200
Please, don't take this the wrong way.
I don't expect anything back really.

854
01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:34.460
I just want to say it.

855
01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:37.730
One time in my life.

856
01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:40.832
And really mean it.

857
01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:43.660
I

858
01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:47.000
love

859
01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:51.000
you.

860
01:23:02.300 --> 01:23:03.760
You'll have us going up here.

861
01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:05.860
Honey, it's time.

862
01:23:05.900 --> 01:23:07.900
No, we're down here.

863
01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:09.400
We just came from this place,
alright?

864
01:23:10.700 --> 01:23:13.700
You need to tell me what happened.

865
01:23:21.700 --> 01:23:25.760
In fact, look at the last group
of palm trees over there.

866
01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:28.400
We should go investigate them.

867
01:23:28.900 --> 01:23:31.000
You should go investigate
over there, right?

868
01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:33.100
You had your chance.

869
01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
You had your chance.

870
01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:05.100
Stop!

871
01:26:00.900 --> 01:26:05.000
This is not about me, Rebecca.

872
01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:23.500
I want to taste you.

873
01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:34.400
Oh, I love the way you smell.

874
01:28:38.700 --> 01:28:41.860
You know, you've been working for me
for -what- five years now?

875
01:28:41.900 --> 01:28:43.760
I've never seen you like this.

876
01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:46.660
You haven't taken a new client
in -what- six weeks?

877
01:28:46.700 --> 01:28:49.060
And don't even try to tell me
that you've been busy

878
01:28:49.100 --> 01:28:51.960
because I know exactly what
you've been busy doing.

879
01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:58.560
It needs to stop now
for your own good.

880
01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:00.060
I don't want it to stop.

881
01:29:00.100 --> 01:29:01.960
I know you don't.

882
01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:06.960
But I have seen so many girls
go down this track, fall for Johns.

883
01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:08.900
It's not like that.

884
01:29:09.300 --> 01:29:11.460
It's never like that.

885
01:29:11.700 --> 01:29:14.360
But it never ends well.

886
01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:19.160
I have to. I'm sorry.

887
01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:22.300
I'm sorry.

888
01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:26.600
I've got your back, kid.

889
01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:55.275
Bloody hell, girls.

890
01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:34.660
This artwork that you do, Paris,
seriously it's amazing.

891
01:30:34.700 --> 01:30:37.760
Was this what you were used to do?

892
01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:39.160
It's a hobby.

893
01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:41.660
I love this.
It's so cute.

894
01:30:41.700 --> 01:30:44.660
Honey, this is not a hobby.

895
01:30:44.700 --> 01:30:48.660
You are extremely talented.
I'm not kidding.

896
01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:53.460
Tell me.

897
01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:56.660
Well, the point is…

898
01:30:56.700 --> 01:31:01.487
sort of besides the point…

899
01:31:02.100 --> 01:31:05.222
In and of itself…

900
01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:08.841
What does any of them really mean?

901
01:31:09.100 --> 01:31:10.844
Nothing.

902
01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:17.235
But when you put one here,

903
01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:20.960
and here,

904
01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.760
and here,

905
01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:30.460
all of these funny,
random, seemingly,

906
01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:33.960
as in life, disjointed pieces,

907
01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:38.500
somehow they all
magically come together.

908
01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:45.160
Every speck,

909
01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:48.341
every part…

910
01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:57.760
it all comes together

911
01:31:57.800 --> 01:32:01.500
to create the whole picture.

912
01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:30.760
I was instructed to give you this
after the funeral.

913
01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:32.660
I'm so sorry.

914
01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:35.840
Who are you?

915
01:33:44.700 --> 01:33:47.960
I have to tell you.
In all my years

916
01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.928
I have never
been stumped by a client.

917
01:33:51.100 --> 01:33:53.100
Not once.

918
01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:57.760
Until now. Okay.
So here's the truth:

919
01:33:57.800 --> 01:34:00.960
I watch a lot
of soap operas.

920
01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:05.960
So when I got your call,
at first I thought:

921
01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.960
"Oh, that had to be
Mrs. White's evil twin".

922
01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:13.260
Or you were going to blackmail Valentina,
which I do not recommend,

923
01:34:13.300 --> 01:34:16.476
because that gal
is one crazy bitch.

924
01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.560
My favorite:
you are actually looking for

925
01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:23.025
a ticket on Valentina's
gravy train yourself.

926
01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:27.555
No.

927
01:34:39.900 --> 01:34:41.767
Thank you.

928
01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:44.636
I needed that.

929
01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:50.442
And thank you
for meeting with me.

930
01:34:51.100 --> 01:34:53.000
What can I do for you?

931
01:34:53.500 --> 01:34:57.017
When the time comes,
I'd like you to give this to Paris.

932
01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:02.160
It's a gift.
She'll know what it means.

933
01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:05.700
But you see her almost every day,
why don't you just give it to her?

934
01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:07.860
No, I…

935
01:35:07.900 --> 01:35:13.060
I have not been able to see
Paris for the last few days.

936
01:35:13.100 --> 01:35:18.560
Ohh, lovers quarrel. Sorry.

937
01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:21.960
You know, would you mind
losing the shades?

938
01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:25.487
I can't see you.
It drives me nuts.

939
01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:41.500
- You really tied one on last night.
- This is important.

940
01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:43.900
I want her to get out.

941
01:35:43.894 --> 01:35:50.460
Did it ever occur to you that
maybe we do this because we like it?

942
01:35:50.500 --> 01:35:55.300
That we are proud of our trade,
that we've had opportunities?

943
01:35:55.500 --> 01:35:58.500
You, yes.

944
01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:03.000
But not Paris.

945
01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:06.728
You really care about her,
don't you?

946
01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:21.940
I'm in love with her.

947
01:36:21.980 --> 01:36:24.860
Yes, you are.

948
01:36:26.700 --> 01:36:32.028
But I hate to tell you,
you're not gonna be the last.

949
01:36:33.300 --> 01:36:38.507
I need to be her last… client.

950
01:36:39.100 --> 01:36:41.392
She trusts you, Sylvie.

951
01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:44.280
She relies on you,
I know that.

952
01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:49.715
I'm not gonna be
seeing Paris again.

953
01:36:50.100 --> 01:36:53.084
So, your husband found out, hm?

954
01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:57.285
You want soap opera?

955
01:37:03.700 --> 01:37:06.933
I'm dying.

956
01:37:07.300 --> 01:37:10.052
Cancer.

957
01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:15.060
I don't have
a lot of time left and

958
01:37:15.100 --> 01:37:20.400
I'm beginning to have some
severe physical symptoms.

959
01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:25.300
I don't want Paris
to see me like this.

960
01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:29.260
I want her to remember me…

961
01:37:29.300 --> 01:37:30.951
Of course you do.

962
01:37:30.991 --> 01:37:32.573
…remember the good stuff.

963
01:37:33.100 --> 01:37:35.958
Okay, listen to me.

964
01:37:36.300 --> 01:37:39.300
You have got to say goodbye to her.

965
01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:41.460
You have to.

966
01:37:41.500 --> 01:37:43.460
You know that.

967
01:37:43.500 --> 01:37:46.953
Look, you're scared.

968
01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.604
You can't just disappear.

969
01:37:52.100 --> 01:37:53.860
And I don't want you to worry

970
01:37:53.900 --> 01:37:57.860
not about Paris, because
I'm gonna pick her back up.

971
01:37:57.900 --> 01:38:00.860
I'm gonna put her
in my back pocket.

972
01:38:00.900 --> 01:38:03.460
Okay? I'm gonna take care of Paris,

973
01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:05.460
but you have to tell her.

974
01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:07.600
And not just for her.

975
01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.300
For you.

976
01:38:12.500 --> 01:38:14.760
For you.

977
01:38:15.900 --> 01:38:19.115
So, as we say in the trade,

978
01:38:20.300 --> 01:38:22.216
"women up".

979
01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:37.559
I need to say goodbye.

980
01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:41.460
What's going on?

981
01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:43.860
I love you so much.

982
01:40:43.900 --> 01:40:46.460
We really want this.

983
01:40:46.500 --> 01:40:49.160
Oh, I want this.

984
01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:52.360
I've wanted this my whole life.

985
01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:55.200
And you gave it to me.

986
01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:55.100
Hi, sweetie.

987
01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:00.700
You okay?

988
01:42:01.300 --> 01:42:03.416
We'll see you at the house.

989
01:42:05.500 --> 01:42:12.360
Your mother retained me to work
for you as long as you need me.

990
01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:14.000
Oh, what's this?

991
01:42:14.100 --> 01:42:16.562
Your mother revised her will.

992
01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:22.460
She was very busy
her last few months.

993
01:42:22.500 --> 01:42:26.905
This will all become clear to you
when you're able to read through it.

994
01:42:27.900 --> 01:42:30.360
- You guys all right?
- Yeah. We're all right.

995
01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:36.579
She wanted to make sure that
there wasn't anything that you needed.

996
01:42:37.700 --> 01:42:41.460
She was pretty certain
there would be some

997
01:42:41.500 --> 01:42:45.100
harsh feelings
among the ranks.

998
01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:49.260
So she retained me

999
01:42:49.300 --> 01:42:51.700
to protect your interests.

1000
01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:56.660
If it makes any difference,
I have never met a woman

1001
01:42:56.700 --> 01:43:01.160
with more character
than your mother.

1002
01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:04.369
My sincerest condolences.

1003
01:43:17.300 --> 01:43:19.734
Are you okay?

1004
01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:29.393
I'll see you at home, okay?

1005
01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:47.900
"My dear Jessica,"

1006
01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:49.660
My dear Jessica,

1007
01:43:49.700 --> 01:43:53.800
I know this can't erase the past
but it will protect your future.

1008
01:43:54.100 --> 01:43:56.660
When your dad signed
his assets over to me

1009
01:43:56.700 --> 01:43:58.960
I decided to reconstruct my will

1010
01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:02.560
so that all three
of my children would be equal

1011
01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:07.000
and all sharing your futures
as true brothers and sisters.

1012
01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.060
So what I couldn't do
in my lifetime,

1013
01:44:10.100 --> 01:44:13.900
I've done now.
Protected you.

1014
01:44:17.500 --> 01:44:18.760
Just know

1015
01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:20.800
I am with you.

1016
01:44:21.600 --> 01:44:24.660
I love you,

1017
01:44:24.700 --> 01:44:26.000
mom.

1018
01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:55.435
Oh, my god.

1019
01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:02.800
Excuse me.

1020
01:45:07.900 --> 01:45:11.500
Excuse me,
Ms. Scofield?

1021
01:45:12.500 --> 01:45:15.800
You're the artist, right?
Hi.

1022
01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:18.960
Yeah?

1023
01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:20.660
Do I know you?

1024
01:45:20.700 --> 01:45:22.860
No.

1025
01:45:22.900 --> 01:45:26.016
But you knew my mother.

1026
01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:34.260
And

1027
01:45:34.300 --> 01:45:44.000
I want to know…

1028
01:45:37.800 --> 01:45:42.760
I want to know about my mom.

1029
01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:45.660
Okay.

1030
01:45:45.700 --> 01:45:50.060
See, I feel like I've known her
in a very black and white way.

1031
01:45:50.100 --> 01:45:53.560
And I want to know
who she became

1032
01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:55.600
in the end.

1033
01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
And now for Miss Scofield's
center piece…

1034
01:46:02.100 --> 01:46:04.300
What would you like to know?

1035
01:46:07.100 --> 01:46:09.000
"Une petite mort".
