00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.169
Our quiet town of 7,000 residents holds

4
00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:27.869
more than a Southern manners
and prize-winning fried

5
00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.259
chicken recipes.
We also hold discretion.

6
00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:35.970
The biggest indication of which lies in

7
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.570
our bank's coffers and buried in our dirt.

8
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.620
Cash - lots and lots of it.
In our small town,

9
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.140
we have 45 millionaires and 3

10
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.850
billionaires. That's a rough guess.
It all

11
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.160
depends on how stupid or smart

12
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.899
the generations have been with their Crown

13
00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.550
Cola stock - that's where it came from.

14
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.670
Crown Cola. Say Pepsi or Coca Cola

15
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.319
in this town and you best

16
00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:08.489
watch your back on the way out. It was Cole

Masten, Hollywood award-winning A-list

18
00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:14.490
actor. The man women would
think about in the

19
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.100
dark of the night.
Who read a little

20
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.900
Southern novel that no one had ever

21
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.230
heard of and he was fascinated by it.

22
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.050
A novel about our town. A novel that

23
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.240
exposed the plantation homes for what

24
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.780
they were.
The camouflage of millionaires.

Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.

would be an appropriate time to thrust

33
00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.090
themselves into our lives.
- Summer,

34
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.129
I'd imagine you're ready for your big day

35
00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:30.489

Hello -Hi.
- What can I do for

40
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.740
somebody stopping by unannounced?
- Please

41
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.090
tell me you're the owner of this

42
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:14.410
fabulous estate.
- No. why? - Do you have

43
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.320
owner's number?
- Oh, I can't give you the

44
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.160
Holden's number known that you're a stranger.

45
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.570
Why do you want?
-I'm not really at

46
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:29.470
liberty to discuss.
-Oh, well, good luck.

47
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.800
But, what? God.

Feel free to take a seat, Mr. Payne
It is hot out.

50
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.800
How do you know my name?
- The way you've

51
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.360
been stomping around town? The cows in

52
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.610
Thomas County can even know your name.
-Is that why

53
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.460
I've been so unsuccessful? Because I'm as

54
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.980
you so politely put it, stomping around?

55
00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.839
It’s two-fold.

56
00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:30.089
You’ve been stomping around town but

57
00:04:30.089 --> 00:04:31.800
you've not been telling people what you want.

58
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.430
This is a private town and we don't
like strangers.

59
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.920
I was instructed to be discreet.

60
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.140
Were you instructed to be successful?

61
00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.940
Because you can't be both.

62
00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:50.370
I’m Summer. Summer Jenkins.
- Bennington Payne. My friends call me

63
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.920
Ben and at the moment,

64
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.180
you're looking like the
only friend I have around

65
00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.420
Here.
- Lets not label this relationship just yet.

66
00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:03.870
Now, what do you want in Quincy?
- I’m a location scout from

67
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.760
Envision entertainment and I'm here to

68
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.760
Procure your spots for-
- The movie.

69
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.860
How do you know?
- Everybody in Quincy knows

70
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.290
about the movie.
The mayor got the call.

71
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.810
Caroline, the new secretary
she called her sister.

72
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.850
Within five minutes, it had

73
00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:23.130
spread like wildfire.
You see there are

74
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.130
two types of secrets in Quincy.
The ones

75
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.790
we keep close and then we have the

76
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.790
really juicy one.
- And the movie news is juicy.

77
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.330
So there shouldn't be a problem.
- No one

78
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.110
Is gonna let you film in their home.
- Why not?

79
00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:41.970
They get money, fame and bragging rights.

80
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.680
People in Quincy don't need money.

81
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.600
Present company excluded.

82
00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:52.999
This is the old South.
Bragging is a sign

83
00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:56.629
of weakness.
- Please, all the mansion's all

84
00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:59.719
the big gates.
- Mm-hmm. All old money.

85
00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:03.229
This movie is starring the Cole Masten.

86
00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:05.270
Academy Award-winning actor.
Quite possibly,

87
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.399
the most beautiful man to grace

88
00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:09.860
Hollywood in the last decade.
The man

89
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.719
women dream about in the dark of the night.

90
00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:16.580
Really? Not all the women.

91
00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:17.180
So what do I do?

92
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.460
I need a mansion preferably two and a

93
00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.039
Bar or tractor, a cotton field
in 15 other locations.

94
00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:28.669
What I think you need? You need

95
00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:32.509
a local somebody from Quincy. Somebody

96
00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:35.089
who can negotiate with the landowner and

97
00:06:35.089 --> 00:06:36.949
someone that can make all the necessary

98
00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:40.279
Arrangements with the locals.
- But that’s my job.

99
00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:42.469
How much they are paying you for this job?

100
00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:48.729
120,000 -I'll do it for 25. –15. –20.

101
00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:51.640
And I’m the only hope you have.

102

[Music]

103
00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:57.800
Deal.

104
00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.730
[Music]

105
00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:07.540
Okay. Are you ready?
- Let's do it. –Cole, tell us

106
00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:11.230
about your wife.
- I don't she

107
00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:13.480
Needs an introduction I am pretty sure

108
00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.490
you're familiar with her.
- Well, you've

109
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.410
been married now almost five years, which,

110
00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:20.920
in Hollywood is quite a feat. Tell our

111
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.020
viewers what is your best advice for a

112
00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.110
successful marriage?
That’s a good question.

113
00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:28.900
I think a lot of elements

114
00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:30.610
elements make for a successful marriage.

115
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:33.850
But if I had to pick one, I would say

116
00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:38.110
Honesty. Honesty is crucial.
Nadia and I

117
00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:40.720
have no secrets.
We tell each other everything.

118
00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.850
Our philosophy is to get everything

119
00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:45.160
out in the open, no matter the

120
00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.150
Consequences.
- I think that's great. I hear

121
00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:50.650
you're going to my home state of Georgia

122
00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:54.490
for your next project.
- I am, yes.

123
00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:57.010
The Fortune Bottle.
It's a story of the early days

124
00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:58.630
of this soda and the wealth that

125
00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:00.400
created in a small town called Quincy.

126
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.700
and how a young feisty secretary played

127
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:07.180
By Minka was very instrumental in the

128
00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:09.970
Development of the product.
It's based on a book

129
00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:12.400
I read and it's also the very

130
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.320
First time that I'm in charge
of the production.

131
00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.440
We're gonna start filming soon.

132
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:20.020
I’m looking forward to seeing

133
00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:21.870
The Fortune Bottle when it hits the screen.

134
00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:24.420
So good to see you, Jenny.

135
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.860
Thank you so much for having me.

136
00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.370
Come back any time.

137
00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.930
Minka can't make it.

138
00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:36.580
She wants to reschedule the
read-through tomorrow.

139
00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:39.159
Her heart's not in this project, Cole,

140
00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:40.539
which is going to make it more difficult

141
00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:43.240
for me to direct her especially if she keeps

142
00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:46.029
rescheduling our meeting.
- She said she's in.

143
00:08:46.029 --> 00:08:48.279
I can't think of anybody else

144
00:08:48.279 --> 00:08:53.200
Who fits that role.
- We need an Ida, Cole. Can’t make the movie

145
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.760
without her.
- I'll handle it.

146
00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.360
Okay, uh, do you want me to schedule a

147
00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:02.320
massage for you later today.
- No, take me home.

148
00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.959
I want to surprise Nadia.
Oh, and, uh,

149
00:09:04.959 --> 00:09:06.579
what's going on in Quincy?

150
00:09:06.579 --> 00:09:09.130
Oh, the location manager
was a real hot mess.

151
00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:10.540
But he has turned it around and

152
00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.459
he's securing locations as we speak.

153
00:09:12.459 --> 00:09:16.600
I liked my hotel.
It has a pool and it's

154
00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.589
hot here in Georgia.

155
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:22.510
Why did she just looked at you like

156
00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:26.980
she'd been into a bad piece.
- Quincy and I have history.

157
00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:33.310
Good afternoon, Mrs. Wright.

158
00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:35.890
This is Mr. Bennington Payne.

159
00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:37.959
He's in town scouting for locations for

160
00:09:37.959 --> 00:09:41.390
the movie.
That'd be the one with Cole Masten?

161
00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:43.380
That's right. The Fortune Bottle.

162
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:46.540
Mr. Payne would like to
stay with you if you have

163
00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:47.949
room, of course.

164
00:09:47.949 --> 00:09:52.690
Oh, would you now?
- He'll be in town for

165
00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:55.480
quite sometimes while,
he prepares things

166
00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.640
for the movie and of course he's working

167
00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:04.769
very closely with Cole Masten.
- Oh, is that so?

168
00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:04.769


169
00:10:04.769 --> 00:10:09.300
Well, I might just have a room for you?

170
00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:12.540
Mr. Payne.

How bad is this?

174
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:06.770
Gargantuan bad.
- Is the movie gonna crash?
- No, The Fortune Bottle

175
00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:08.240
isn't crashing, okay?
Movies don't fall apart

176
00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.459
over this. We should be more

177
00:11:10.459 --> 00:11:15.320
worried if this is the end of Codia.

178
00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:18.380
People love Codia.
Cole and Nadia are the

179
00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:20.209
glue that holds our picture-perfect
world together.

180
00:11:20.209 --> 00:11:22.279
They buy each other extravagant

181
00:11:22.279 --> 00:11:24.380
gifts and have ridiculously hot sex

182
00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:24.860
together.

183
00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.200
Codia can’t fall apart. They can't get

184
00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.730
divorced and we certainly can’t have Cole

185
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:32.029
attempting murder on Nadia's lover.

186
00:11:32.029 --> 00:11:34.070
Sheriff called and he's
worried if Cole Masten’s

187
00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:36.649
violent. He's had a lot of calls

188
00:11:36.649 --> 00:11:38.540
from voters. This is an election year.

189
00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:42.140
Votes are everything.
Of all the things I'm worried about

190
00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:43.910
Cole Masten’s risks to townsfolk

191
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:46.700
is not one of them.
- It’s not

192
00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.410
The townsfolk he's worried about.

193
00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:49.930
He’s worried about your
California golden boy.

194
00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:53.270
This is the carry state.
We value our

195
00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:56.000
personal safety here.
We don't want him getting

196
00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.209
himself shot.
- Shot? They can’t

197
00:11:59.209 --> 00:12:01.459
shoot the Cole Masten.
No one is shooting-

198
00:12:01.459 --> 00:12:07.339
Okay. Okay! Just simmer down.
I think you got a

199
00:12:07.339 --> 00:12:08.560
wrinkle.

200
00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.650
[Music]
On your forehead. Yeah.

201
00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:16.100
The moment you’re yammering about Cadia.
- Codia! Not Cadia.

202
00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:19.670
Codia.
- Whateveria.

203
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:24.529
[Music]

204
00:12:44.529 --> 00:12:52.879
Cole. – Got the divorce papers.
- Honey, just hold a second.
I’ll be right back.

205
00:12:52.879 --> 00:12:55.930
Let’s go somewhere private.

206
00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:13.720
I'm sorry, Cole.

207
00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.330
You should have called.
I got our lawyers involved.

208
00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:18.580
It's over.

209
00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:26.970
We're over. –No.
-I don't love you anymore.

210
00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:31.030
I don't know if I ever really did love you.

211
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:35.470
I mean, I think,
I just like the idea of you.

212
00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:40.840
- but, how?
- That we’re equals and you're

213
00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:47.340
no longer Bikini Babe Number 3.
- Yeah.

214
00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:56.260
I'm sorry. It's not personal.
- This. This

215
00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.410
makes it personal.
Never caring about

216
00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:02.620
The Fortune Bottle and now you want it.

217
00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:08.110
It’s a joint asset.
- No, it is not. I purchased it.

218
00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:10.360
I am producing it.
No one's gonna think

219
00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:14.620
it's a joint asset.
- I think it is and,

220
00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:21.130
Tony agrees. – Tony, our lawyer?
He's not my lawyer.

221
00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:25.630
How quickly you moved from an apology

222
00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:28.600
to business?
How long have you been

223
00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:31.200
planning this?

224
00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:41.760
I need a lawyer. The best damn divorce

225
00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:43.050
lawyer in the country.

226
00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:45.030
That would be Brad DeLuca.
He handles

227
00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:46.980
every big celebrity divorce.
- Get him here

228
00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:48.870
I don't care the cost.
- All right. I’m on it.

229
00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:52.140
Wait where do you want to go?
- Anywhere with alcohol

230
00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:56.720
and women.
- Okay.

231
00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:04.929
[Music]

232
00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:15.900


233
00:15:40.899 --> 00:15:43.899
Shit!

234
00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:49.220
Thank you.

235
00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:57.250
You're late.
- Sorry. Business to attend.

236
00:15:57.250 --> 00:16:01.090
Bullshit! Pussy isn’t business,
and this,

237
00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:02.800
right now, is the most important
thing in your life.

238
00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.390
So when we make an appointment,

239
00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:10.920
keep it.
- You know you work for me, right?

240
00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:15.460
here. This is Leonard McCloud.

241
00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:17.529
He’ll put up with your bullshit and

242
00:16:17.529 --> 00:16:18.610
cover your ass in court.

243
00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:24.430
Oh, so they're the best. –Exactly.
-I've paid you

244
00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:31.050
your advance.
- And, I’ll refund it.
- Sit down and hold on.

245
00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:34.050
Please.

246
00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:40.730
Sit down.

247
00:16:49.449 --> 00:16:52.769
I'm sorry. I’m late.

248
00:16:53.279 --> 00:16:59.420
Sorry?
- I'm sorry.

249
00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:08.220


250
00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:11.520
Look, you've been a celebrity
for a long time,

251
00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.819
but in a courtroom, against your wife?

252
00:17:14.819 --> 00:17:18.770
You’re equals to each other.

253
00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:21.180
You’re, you’re nothing to the judge.

254
00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:24.510
You’re normal.
If I'm gonna represent you,

255
00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:25.890
 you have to know that life as you know

256
00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:26.630
it is over.

257
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:29.609
You're not a bachelor yet,
not until this divorce

258
00:17:29.609 --> 00:17:33.480
is final. You are my bitch,
and I will say

259
00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.000
if and who you fuck,
what you say to whom,

260
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.130
and when and how you work.

261
00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:39.810
If you want to keep this film as yours,

262
00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:42.060
you will leave this shithole
of a city and go to Georgia.

263
00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:44.220
You’ll keep your dick clean

264
00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:46.230
and that pretty-boy head of yours down

265
00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:49.560
and do your job… nothing else.
I've buried five,

266
00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.410
five of your indiscretion since Sunday.

267
00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:54.300
My team doesn't have
time for the popularity

268
00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.370
contest your dick has entered.

269
00:17:56.370 --> 00:18:00.150
We are gonna paint you as Hollywood's

270
00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:03.420
Golden Boy. You listen to me,
and I promise you

271
00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:05.180
I will keep The Fortune Bottle of yours

272
00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:09.300
and any other shared assets you want.

273
00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:14.280
I just want the movie.
She can have the rest.

274
00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:19.940
Okay, I need you to commit to my terms.

275
00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:27.560
No sex. No relationships. No women.

276
00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:30.760
Agreed.

277
00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:33.430
Oh, and,

278
00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:36.030
let's go.

279
00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:44.860
Go where? –Quincy. -Morning, Masten.
–This guy is fucking lunatic.

280
00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:47.470
We’re getting in a jet right now.
Heading to Quincy.

281
00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:52.710
Now, now?
– Yes. Now, now.
It’s a fucking Brad’s idea.

282
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:56.550
You’ll be there in a three and a half-

Hey, you're that movie star?
Well, what you doing in Quincy?

285
00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:18.590
You got engine trouble?

286
00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:22.110
No, has my assistant not called?
- Nope.

287
00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:25.970
Nope, nobody's called.
- Is my car ready?

288
00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:33.000
- Nope.
- Bad news. Your assistant
been in an accident.

289
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:33.480
What?

290
00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.640
Posted on TMZ.
He's alive, but he's

291
00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:39.810
pretty beat up.
- We got to get back to LA.

292
00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:43.620
- No. No.
- He's been my assistant for 13 years.

293
00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:45.720
I gotta go see him.

294
00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.060
No, you're not going anywhere.
Oh, the

295
00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:49.020
LA hospitals are gonna be a zoo,

296
00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:54.500
waiting for you.
- Mean to a borrow a vehicle?

297
00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.780
That worked for you?
- Sure thing.

298
00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:05.550
I'm checking the local contact now.

299
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.920
You’re going to burn.
-No, I’m not.
–Yes, you are.

300
00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.370
You didn't put on any sunscreen.

301
00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:19.800
I don’t wear sunscreen.
- You do realize the Sun is literally

302
00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:22.250
aging you before my eyes.

303
00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:24.690
You do realize you're
in Georgia and not the

304
00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:25.830
Wild West and you've completely

305
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:28.140
ridiculous in that cowboy hat.
- I look

306
00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:30.300
fantastic.
- You look stupid.

307
00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:36.370
[Laughter]

308
00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:46.410
No days off for important people.
- Bennington Payne. Where am I right now?
Quincy. I’m sorry. Who is this? Yes, sir?

309
00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:49.560
Yeah, I thought that- okay. Okay.

310
00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:50.070
What’s your address?

311
00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:53.580
4 Darrow Lane.
- 4 Darrow Lane. Okay, yeah.

312
00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:57.150
Thank you so- ciao!
Cole Masten is here.

313
00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:58.260
That was his attorney
wanted to know where I was

314
00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:01.340
He’s bringing Cole Masten, here. Now.

315
00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:04.710
How far away is the airport?
- Five. Maybe 10 minutes.

They're not going to come inside.
They're just

318
00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:21.060
coming to pick me up.
They’d probably

319
00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:24.480
won't even get out of the car.
- Okay.

320
00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.620
Are you sure this is the right place?

321
00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:42.050
Yep. Yep, Yep.

Is Bennington here?
- Yes, he’s been expecting you.

325

Uh, would you be a dear and fetch him

326
00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:08.630
for us.
- Sure, I'll just get it.

327
00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:10.930
Thank you.

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:15.950
No!
- Hi, I’m Ben. Bennington Payne.

It’s so lovely to meet you.
- Bennington, will you get

330
00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:21.970
Mr. Masten settled in his hotel now?

331
00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:24.680
I'm so sorry but because we weren't

332
00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.600
expecting Mr. Masten
so soon, the estate

333
00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:27.920
where he'll be staying
– Kirkland’s house

334
00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.420
won't be ready for a few more days

335
00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:32.350
but there are other options in town.

336
00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:36.170
Sorry, what? it turns
out the Kirkland house

337
00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:38.600
isn't available yet but Bennington here-

338
00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:42.170
It's Ben.
- Yeah, has a few ideas where

339
00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:45.520
he can house you for the time being.

340
00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:49.670
Sorry to ruin this delightful porch party,

341
00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:53.000
but can we take this inside?

342
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.760
Air conditioning?
- Sure, if you have a second,
can I get y’all some sweet tea.

343
00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:01.160
Actually, I gotta get going.
My wife will have

344
00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:02.600
my head if I don't come home in time

345
00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:06.430
for dinner.
- I’m afraid, I didn’t catch your name?

346
00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:09.260
Oh, Summer. Summer Jenkins.
It's nice to meet you.
- I could fix you

347
00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:10.760
sweet tea for the road.
- No. That wouldn’t be

348
00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:12.520
necessary but I appreciate the offer.

349
00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:18.280
Nice meeting you.
Behave!

350
00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:28.280
How about that tea?
- Sparkling water, please.

351
00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:35.030
We don't have sparkling.
- Still is fine.

352
00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:10.560
How was your flight?
You do know it's rude to

353
00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:12.210
ignore someone when they're asking you a

354
00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:14.420
question.

355
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:18.870
I've booked you in a motel room for a

356
00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:22.430
couple of days until your estates ready.

357
00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.930
Start over I wasn't listening.
- I found you

358
00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:29.340
a motel room until your state's ready

359
00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:33.470
in a couple of days.
- Who are you?

360
00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:36.300
No offense but how are
you involved in this?

361
00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:39.390
She's been helping me.
- No offense, Mr. Masten,

362
00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:42.950
but you stood in my living room,

363
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:45.480
sucking up my air-conditioner,
drinking my

364
00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:50.070
still water.
That's why I'm here and I'm

365
00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:53.820
not involved in anything,
Mr. Masten. Ben here

366
00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:56.730
is my friend.
We were having a pool party

367
00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:58.230
when your attorney called and

368
00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:01.320
bulldozed y’all’s in here.

369
00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:07.010
You’re all Southern fight and
spitfire attitude. - Yeah,

370
00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:11.070
get out or I swear to God,
I'll shoot you.

371
00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:14.600
She means it. She has
gun in her coat closet.

372
00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:23.800
She's fantastic.

373
00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:28.070
Pardon me?

374
00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:30.020
There’s only a month before
filming it's impossible.

375
00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:31.610
Minka is dying to get out of

376
00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:35.030
this movie. I'm telling you,
this girl is

377
00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:36.230
perfect.

378
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:38.360
Get your ass on a plane and come to Quincy.

379
00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.880
You're an actor, Cole.
You know everybody

380
00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.950
can't do this.
The last thing I want is

381
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:45.290
is to stick a wooden face on the screen.

382
00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:47.900
That's the beauty of it, Don.

383
00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:50.330
She won't have to act at all.
She just has to be

384
00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:53.300
herself.
No. I am NOT throwing this

385
00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:55.400
whole movie in the can just because some

386
00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:57.500
wannabe starlet sucked your dick.

387
00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:58.340
cornfield.

388
00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:04.100
Cotton field. Didn’t you read the book?
And I am not in love.

389
00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.320
This girl completely blew
me off but she was

390
00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:08.720
Georgian as hell doing it.

391
00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:12.110
Pure friggin’ Southern charm.
I'm telling you

392
00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:15.350
you come here. Meet the girl,
and if you you don't

393
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:19.550
like her, all right. Tell me
to go to hell tomorrow.

394
00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:21.230
Alright, I have a plane
waiting for me Van Nuys

395
00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:23.830
in an hour.
- Yes!

396
00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:26.750
Alright, let's turn this baby around.

397
00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:29.630
Let's go back to the girl's place.

398
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:32.870
What was her name again?
- Summer. You want to cast

399
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:36.590
cast her in Minka’s role. –Yep.
- But that’s the lead.

400
00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:39.800
She’s perfect for the role.
- Maybe,

401
00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:41.420
you should let me bring it up to her.

402
00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:43.220
She can be a little headstrong.

403
00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:47.440
Yeah, I got that.
- I don’t think she likes you very much.

404
00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:54.899
Good. That’s a good thing.
- Summer!

405
00:27:09.899 --> 00:27:16.769
He wants you to star in the movie.
- Oh, come on. Bennington Payne,
are you yanking my legs?

406
00:27:16.769 --> 00:27:18.539
No, I’m not. He wants you to take
Minka Price’s role. He says you’re perfect.

407
00:27:18.539 --> 00:27:27.210
Authentic. He said authentic.
“She’s perfect for the role”.
- How much does it pay?

408
00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:31.450
Girls in LA they’d screwed.
They kidnap, they

409
00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:34.440
kill for something like this.
- No, seriously. How much does it pay?

410
00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:40.149
No idea. I don’t know. Ask Cole.
He’s in the car.
- D’you mean waiting in the car? – Yes.

411
00:27:46.149 --> 00:27:50.590
You must be Cole Masten.
- Oh, how’d you know?

412
00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:52.480
My daughter left me a voice message said

413
00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:55.559
don't come home.
Cole Masten is here.

414
00:27:55.559 --> 00:27:58.059
And nothing makes a mother come home quicker

415
00:27:58.059 --> 00:28:00.480
than to tell her to stay away.

416
00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:04.889
How do you know Summer?
- I just met her today.

417
00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:04.899


418
00:28:04.899 --> 00:28:10.340
A few hours ago. I came here to meet Ben.
- Oh, you work on the movie also?

419
00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:15.129
I’m an actor.

420
00:28:15.129 --> 00:28:18.039
An award-winning actor.
- Well, that's nice.

421
00:28:18.039 --> 00:28:20.830
I’m Francis Jenkins.
Would you be a dear and

422
00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:25.269
help me inside with this stuff.
- Of course.

423
00:28:25.269 --> 00:28:28.730
An actor, you say?
Yes, ma'am.

424
00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:30.830
We need to work on that Southern drawl.

425
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:34.250
Mama. I see you ignored my voicemail.

426
00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:38.210
Oh, you called? I must have missed that.
- Thank you.

427
00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:48.590
So did Ben talk to you about the part?

428
00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:53.960
He did. –And?
- And I’d be curious

429
00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.370
what kind of conversation you'd be offering.

430
00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:59.330
What kind of compensation would you like?

431
00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:02.059
I don't know. I don't know what

432
00:29:02.059 --> 00:29:04.760
would be fair. That's why I'm asking you.

433
00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:08.330
- And you trust me to be fair?
- Well, I trust you

434
00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:10.370
to give me your honest opinion about

435
00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:12.559
what the size of the role in this type

436
00:29:12.559 --> 00:29:17.019
of movie for someone of my
experience would be worth.

437
00:29:18.519 --> 00:29:21.080
A hundred thousand and that's being generous.

438
00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:24.230
Your name is negative box office weight.

439
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:26.000
I'll have to spend a fortune to get you

440
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:26.840
camera ready.

441
00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:31.279
but I like you Summer and I think you

442
00:29:31.279 --> 00:29:36.049
fit the part. - Don't do that.
- Do what?

443
00:29:36.049 --> 00:29:39.880
That smile thing.
It's really creepy.

444
00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:44.110
Millions of Americans would disagree.

445
00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:50.980
Are you interested or not?
- No.

446
00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:55.850
No, I'm not.
-You're not?

447
00:29:55.850 --> 00:29:59.580
No. Not for that amount.

448
00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:02.980
I'm worth more.
-The toe of your shoe

449
00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:07.059
all together by duct tape.
- The amount of money

450
00:30:07.059 --> 00:30:09.010
I have is not indicative of my worth.

451
00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:11.470
If it was, it would indicate

452
00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:14.049
the lesser of us two
individuals on this porch.

453
00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:14.049


454
00:30:14.049 --> 00:30:15.640
You’re saying you’re nothing lesser

455
00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:17.350
the individual.
- I'm saying that right now

456
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:18.909
the only one of us being an ass here is you.

457
00:30:18.909 --> 00:30:28.740
So you don’t want the part.
- No.

458
00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:32.399
Not for that amount.

459
00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:39.350
Goodbye, Mr. Masten. That’s what we say,
in the South, when one person leaves.

460
00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:43.760
It’s called valediction.
- What is it called

461
00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:51.580
when one person makes a huge mistake?
- It’s called life.

462
00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:57.200
Gosh, she’s infuriating.

463
00:31:03.170 --> 00:31:05.000


464
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:12.890
Bad day? He's very handsome.

465
00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:19.670
Yeah.
- Want to talk about it?

466
00:31:19.670 --> 00:31:21.090
That eggs already been laid.
It can't be put back

467
00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:25.390
in the chicken now.
-He's very handsome.

468
00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:27.530
[chuckled]

469
00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:31.520
He's also very married.

470
00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:45.340
Night, Summer
- It’s late.

471
00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:51.840
I know how anal you are about
calling before I come.
- Summer, I’m picking up Don Waschoniz,

472
00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:55.450
The Fortune Bottle’s director, in this
pisshole you called airport in 20 minutes.

473
00:31:55.450 --> 00:32:01.940
Then, we’re coming to you. So meet
us outside in 30. If you can sell him
on your sweet demeanor, then,

474
00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:08.540
the role is yours.
You can name your damn price.

475
00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:12.160
Five hundred thousand that's
what I want and then,

476
00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:17.940
I'll do it.
- Fine, 500,000 it is.

477
00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:40.520
Is that, uh-
- Apple cobbler? It is. I was gonna
make pie but I didn’t have time.

478
00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:45.890
Hope that’s okay for you all.
- Oh, Mr. Don Waschoniz.
It’s nice to meet you.

479
00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:49.480
I’ll have you out here on the
porch because my mom is asleep

480
00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:50.950
and she has to be up early in the morning.

481
00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:52.179
I don't want to wake her.

482
00:32:52.179 --> 00:32:56.450
I thought we could all talk out here.

483
00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:01.470
I’ll get you all the cobbler.

484
00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:25.680
So you live with your mama.
- Yeah, my whole life. This is
where I learned to make cobbler.

485
00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:31.460
I don’t like cobbler.
- You'll eat it and

486
00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:33.480
you'll like it, Mr. Masten.

487
00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:43.220
Ahh… there’s my girl.

488
00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:46.000
Coming?
-Yeah.

489
00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:57.360
She’ll be out in a minute.

490
00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:11.330
Hey, y’all. Ben, can you grab
the door? There you go.
 - We’re short on time, Summer.

491
00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:13.400
Would you like some cobbler?
I know that you said in there

492
00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:15.590
that you don't like cobbler
- I'm good.

493
00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:17.600
Summer, can you stand over here?

494
00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:23.000
Oh, sure. Like this?
- How old are you?

495
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.190
29. Never married.
- Turn your head to the left.

496
00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:29.379
Turn your head to the right.

497
00:34:29.379 --> 00:34:31.500
Say something. –Like what?
- Whatever comes to mind.

498
00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:34.129
The brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
- Tell me about the cobbler.

499
00:34:34.129 --> 00:34:37.530
Cobbler? Well, I would have made pie.

500
00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:39.320
Pies much more popular around here

501
00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:41.389
but it takes a great deal longer.

502
00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:44.619
Look at me now. Follow me when I move.
- It’s all about the apple.

503
00:34:44.619 --> 00:34:46.040
Honeycrisp or Granny Smith.

504
00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:49.110
[Music]

505
00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:52.429
I need to see some fire in you, Summer.

506
00:34:52.429 --> 00:34:54.469
Can you get angry for me?
Give me some edge,

507
00:34:54.469 --> 00:34:56.060
Why do you want to know what
goes into my apple cobbler,

508
00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:58.250
Mr. Waschoniz? Are my

509
00:34:58.250 --> 00:34:59.989
homemade desserts not good enough for you?

510
00:34:59.989 --> 00:35:03.449
Don't come into my house
and insult my cooking.

511
00:35:03.449 --> 00:35:05.149
I will trot your testicles up,

512
00:35:05.149 --> 00:35:07.010
wipe that California for a smile

513
00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:09.530
right off your face.
I will poison your taste.

514
00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:10.450
Okay. Okay.

515
00:35:10.450 --> 00:35:16.550
You can do crazy? I get it.

516
00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:17.720
Summer, honey, are you okay?

517
00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:20.960
I heard voices.
- I'm sorry to wake you, mama.

518
00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:28.970
The movie people came. – Oh,
- They want me in the movie.

519
00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:35.119
In the movie? You mean, with that
good-looking young men.
– Don’t smile like that

520
00:35:35.119 --> 00:35:37.369
he just wants me for the movie.

521
00:35:37.369 --> 00:35:44.650
You saw?
-Mm-hmm, if you say so, honey.

522
00:35:50.300 --> 00:36:01.340
[Music]

523
00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:05.030
This is a joke, right?

524
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:08.550
This isn't actually where
I'm supposed to be

525
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:12.080
staying for the next three months.

526
00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:24.480
Please tell me, it's just this room.

527
00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:31.720
Curtains with chickens. Really?
-They’re roosters. You can tell
by the red comb and the wattles.

528
00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:35.170
I want this chicken shit out of here.
- Oh, come on.

529
00:36:35.170 --> 00:36:36.970
It’s cute and homey.

530
00:36:36.970 --> 00:36:39.210
We can't change any of the décor.

531
00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:41.110
Actually that was a very
firm stipulation

532
00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:42.550
in renting the Kirkland’s house.

533
00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:44.470
We can't move or change anything.

534
00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:47.140
And who exactly agreed to that bullshit?

535
00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:49.300
We did and that bullshit is the only

536
00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:50.350
reason you're standing in some

537
00:36:50.350 --> 00:36:53.890
cockroach infested motel. Ben here,

538
00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:55.500
Ben is working his ass off for you.

539
00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:57.010
I think you know about it all the way in

540
00:36:57.010 --> 00:36:58.110
California with all you-

541
00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:11.120
What’s wrong with you?
-What wrong with me? Are you
kidding me? You’re just-

542
00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:17.310
Kiss you. Yeah. Big deal.
You wouldn’t shut up.
- You didn’t ask me to shut up.

543
00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:24.610
You don’t usually ask people to shut up.
You tell them to.
- Hell, I’m telling you

544
00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:26.890
kiss me again like that
and I’ll rip your eyes

545
00:37:26.890 --> 00:37:28.540
out from their sockets.

546
00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:32.560
Well, don’t worry princess.
I have no desire

547
00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:36.510
to repeat that experience.
I’ve had better.

548
00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:40.980
Much, much better.

549
00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:52.800
where's she going?
- Home. Holden’s plantation

550
00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:55.340
and Kirkland’s house.
They’re neighboring estates.

551
00:37:55.340 --> 00:38:00.980
She was living right next?
How pissed is she right now?

552
00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:02.520
Never mind.

553
00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:04.830
Don't answer that.
Let’s go, uh, we’ll see

554
00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:08.300
some locations.
-You’re okay?

555
00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:17.840
[Music]

556
00:38:32.309 --> 00:38:38.500
What the fuck is wrong with you?
- What? It's 8:00 in the morning?

557
00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:39.509
I’m well aware of that.
And my wife has come

558
00:38:39.509 --> 00:38:41.099
three times so far this morning,
so get your ass

559
00:38:41.099 --> 00:38:45.769
out of bed and be productive.
- I’m on California time.

560
00:38:45.769 --> 00:38:48.569
I was very clear on my instructions to you.

561
00:38:48.569 --> 00:38:50.099
You were to go to Quincy and behave.

562
00:38:50.099 --> 00:38:51.749
Not run around grabbing the first

563
00:38:51.749 --> 00:38:57.329
single woman you find. And then
you made her your co-star?
- How do you know that?

564
00:38:57.329 --> 00:39:00.839
Deadline.
- It hasn't hit any press. But it will.

565
00:39:00.839 --> 00:39:02.009
And Nadia’s attorneys are gonna

566
00:39:02.009 --> 00:39:05.749
crucify you with it. You can’t put your
new girlfriend in the movie that we’re trying-

567
00:39:05.749 --> 00:39:10.109
She’s not my new girlfriend.
I’m sorry. Your new fuck
- No.

568
00:39:10.109 --> 00:39:14.670
She is nothing and I didn't cast her ‘cos of-

569
00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:19.400
I cast her because she is Ida Pinkerton.

570
00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:26.309
She’s perfect for the movie;
she was born for this role.

571
00:39:26.309 --> 00:39:33.259
And you’d be proud of me because
I’m behaving. I haven’t thought
about Nadia once I settle down here.

572
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:40.400
Then why did you kiss her?
- How did you know that?

573
00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:47.000
The scout told me. We hired him.
- There was nothing. That kiss was nothing.

574
00:39:47.099 --> 00:39:50.420
This relationship with her worth half of
The Fortune Bottle because that's what
is at stake here.

575
00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:55.369
There is no relationship. Can I just

576
00:39:55.369 --> 00:39:56.569
go back to sleep now?

577
00:39:56.569 --> 00:40:00.420
Sure. At least when you're sleeping
I don’t have to worry about you.

578
00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:04.940
Check your email when you wake up.
I sent over the response we filed
against Nadia. It’s brutal;

579
00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:06.470
I’m just gonna warn you. I don't want to

580
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:08.990
punish Nadia. I just-
- We’re only being aggressive about

581
00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:10.460
The Fortune Bottle, though I think

582
00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:12.270
you're being a fucking Saint
about everything.

583
00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:15.220
Pop you later.

584
00:40:45.650 --> 00:40:49.550
What?
- I brought you something.

585
00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:52.040
Is it breakfast?
- Are you just going to holler down at me

586
00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:56.600
in the rain, or are you gonna let me in?

587
00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:08.359
I could have waited for you
to put some clothes on.

588
00:41:08.359 --> 00:41:10.460
I don't think so.

589
00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:13.529
You seem very persistent with those rocks.

590
00:41:15.529 --> 00:41:20.240
What do you have for me?
Can you please put some pants on?

591
00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:23.619
It’s rude to waltz around with your junk out.

592
00:41:23.619 --> 00:41:26.660
I know yesterday was a little
rough so I wanted

593
00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:27.619
to make it up to you with the

594
00:41:27.619 --> 00:41:32.260
housewarming present.
- A housewarming present.

595
00:41:31.339 --> 00:41:32.260


596
00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:38.150
To mend the fences.
Between you and me.

597
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:42.039
You want to kiss and make up.

598
00:41:42.039 --> 00:41:47.529
In a metaphorical sense, yeah.

599
00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:59.060
What you get for me?
–Right. Are you crazy?

600
00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:01.500
Is that a serious question?
- What normal person

601
00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:03.050
will get someone a fucking bird

602
00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:05.360
for the housewarming gift.
- It’s not a bird.

603
00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:11.730
He's a baby rooster. Oh, come on.
I thought it would be funny.

604
00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:13.880
It’s hilarious. What am I

605
00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:17.630
supposed to do with him? Eat them?
- No, he’s a

606
00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:18.460
pet.

607
00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:23.500
I'm serious, Summer.
I can't have a rooster.

608
00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:26.380
I don't have time. I'm too busy.

609
00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:28.850
I don't know anything about chickens.

610
00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:32.150
It’s a rooster. I've had Fred
sexed him for me.

611
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:33.440
You'll be able to tell by the little

612
00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:35.990
spikes on the top of his head.
Now I need

613
00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:37.580
you to line this with
newspaper. Make

614
00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:39.560
sure the lamp stays on all night.

615
00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:41.990
Baby chickens need a lot of warmth.
- You are

616
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:45.619
taking this thing home with you.
- No, I’m not.

617
00:42:45.619 --> 00:42:50.840
It's a gift and you do not refuse

618
00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:55.480
gifts. It’s rude.

619
00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:57.030
[Music]

620
00:42:57.030 --> 00:43:03.290
Oh and Cole? Welcome to Quincy.

621
00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:06.780
[Music]

622
00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:37.430
Hey, aren’t you the guy, that, uh

623
00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:41.450
I just got a baby rooster,
Cocky. I set the most

624
00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:44.880
original name but-
- Why'd you bring it with you?

625
00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:50.570
I don't know. I mean,
doesn't it need

626
00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:52.790
to be checked out or I don't know

627
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:56.840
if I could leave it alone?

628
00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:03.550
You know, it's a chicken.

629
00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:07.490
It ain't a pet.
I mean, you don't need to give

630
00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:11.190
it a name or put up a
bedazzled collar on it.

631
00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:21.800
What does it eat?
- Corn.

632
00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:26.930
Corn? That's it?
- Yeah, it's a chicken.
I mean we ain't got

633
00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:29.030
no Chef Boyardee nine flavors

634
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:33.500
rainbow got a crap.

635
00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:33.680
If you want to get fancy,

636
00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:35.480
You can use that FRM formula over there

637
00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:38.960
and cost twice as much.
They don't make a

638
00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:42.400
squat shit a bit of difference.

639
00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:45.170
Anything else I might need for him?

640
00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:50.420
Vitamins? Shots? medicines?
- It's a ch-

641
00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:53.740
Chicken, yeah. Got it.

642
00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:08.500
Hello. Special delivery from
Miss Ida Pinkerton.

643
00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:12.930
Here's a script
- Thank you.

644
00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:15.390
Love that dress would look better on me.

645
00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:19.680
You sign that contract yet?
- It's eight-two pages long.

646
00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:21.860
There can't be anything good
to say in that many pages.

647
00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:24.870
Then get an agent like a
good little actress and

648
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:26.730
have them look it over.
- And have them take a percentage?

649
00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:29.910
No.
- Summer, I can't even with you.

650
00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:33.000
Either sign the thing or
pay someone to review it.

651
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.340
Hell, get a lawyer.

652
00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:39.000
Pay him an hourly review.
- My ex is a lawyer.

653
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.960
- Do you trust him?
- I hate him but,

654
00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:46.260
yeah, in business, I do.
- Great. Give him a call.

655
00:45:46.260 --> 00:46:13.800
I gotta run. Mwah!
- Bye.

656
00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:18.290
Hi, Scott.
- Summer, how are you?

657
00:46:18.290 --> 00:46:21.540
Fine, thank you. I have a contract
that I'd like you to look over.

658
00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:26.480
If you good.
- Okay, yeah.  I can do that just,

659
00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:28.830
uh, send it on over to
Shelley, my assistant.

660
00:46:28.830 --> 00:46:30.000
And she'll make sure I get that today.

661
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.030
I know who Shelley is.
She was one of our bridesmaid.

662
00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:36.190
Of course you do.
Something I'm used to saying.

663
00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:42.700
It's a talent contract for the new movie

664
00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:43.290
they want me to be in.

665
00:46:43.290 --> 00:46:46.280
Really?
- Cole wants me for the lead.

666
00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:53.420
Cole?
- I've got to run, Scott and uh,
I'll send it to Shelley.

667
00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:03.190
There's have been a lot of curiosity

668
00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:07.770
about you in town. You work in the movie.

669
00:47:07.770 --> 00:47:10.270
That's just distracting facts from their

670
00:47:10.270 --> 00:47:18.410
original business toward me.

671
00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:21.250
Well, I was thinking that
you want to leave.

672
00:47:21.250 --> 00:47:23.500
And that's why you wanted the job.

673
00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:25.600
For the money and a fresh start.

674
00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:30.100
Oh no, don't you worry about me.
I mean,

675
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:31.510
that is what you do or not.

676
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:33.850
Yeah, right? This little-
you feeling guilty?

677
00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:37.540
Quincy was a great place for you

678
00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:40.560
to grow up, Summer.
But you're a woman now.

679
00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:43.690
And you you need to find your own place

680
00:47:43.690 --> 00:47:49.210
in the world.
I know that and I wouldn't be

681
00:47:49.210 --> 00:47:54.280
a good mama if I tried to hold you back.

682
00:47:54.280 --> 00:48:01.240
Where will you go?
- I don't know,

683
00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:03.670
but I know I want to be
somewhere different.

684
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:10.080
I want to be someone different.

685
00:48:11.330 --> 00:48:14.900
Someone without a path.
Someone without scorn.

686
00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:21.840
I want where I want to be is
someone with a future.

687
00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:27.000
Will you come with me?

688
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.000
No.

689
00:48:30.330 --> 00:48:35.940
No sweetie. I won't. But you
will always have a home.

690
00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:39.930
Right here, with me.
So let that give

691
00:48:39.930 --> 00:48:42.870
you the confidence to go right out there

692
00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:45.740
and take some risks.

693
00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:51.140
You deserve that, Summer.

694
00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:55.630
Deserve that.

cast Summer as the

00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:29.370
leading lady?
- And she had the nerve to

699
00:49:29.370 --> 00:49:31.140
call Scott and ask for his help.

700
00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:34.550
Hasn't she done enough to that poor boy?

701
00:49:34.550 --> 00:49:37.470
Maggie! Hi.
How's that husband of yours?

702
00:49:37.470 --> 00:49:39.870
He's got one foot on a banana peel and

703
00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:42.800
the other on the grave, honey.

Nice truck.
- Brand new. Bought all by myself

708
00:50:44.350 --> 00:50:46.300
without my assistance help

709
00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:49.080
because he's in the Hospital.

710
00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:52.620
Did you put him there?

711
00:50:56.420 --> 00:51:00.559
What did you want?
I'm trying to call you for

712
00:51:00.559 --> 00:51:02.180
the past three hours.
You're not picking up

713
00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:06.500
your cell phone.
I don't have a cell phone.

714
00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:07.940
No, you've been calling the
house phone. I've been

715
00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:10.760
out here working.
- You don't have a cell phone.

716
00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:16.000
- Nope.
- You need to get a cell phone.

717
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.410
At least for the next
couple of months until

718
00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:20.180
the movie wraps then you're welcome to

719
00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:24.000
go back to your life of reclusion,
if you like.

720
00:51:25.109 --> 00:51:30.660
- Why were you calling me?
- You got media training tomorrow

721
00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:32.500
Are you building this fence?

722
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.779
- Mm-hmm.
- Isn't there someone more-

723
00:51:35.779 --> 00:51:38.299
Don't you dare says-
I'm more qualified.

724
00:51:38.299 --> 00:51:43.819
- I'll help.
- Hey, City Boy. You stay in the truck.

725
00:51:43.819 --> 00:51:45.680
We don't want you getting dirty.

726
00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:57.970
I know how to fix the fence, Country.

727
00:52:01.089 --> 00:52:07.660
You called me City Boy. Stay.

728
00:52:18.890 --> 00:52:25.450
Cocky. Just set him down on
the tailgate and roam around.

729
00:52:35.380 --> 00:53:08.009
- He seems to like it.

730
00:52:42.299 --> 00:52:50.819
- Where did you ever build a fence before?
- Didn't you ever seen the Legends of Montana?

731
00:52:50.819 --> 00:52:54.069
Nope.
- Spent six months on the ranch.
Bought the

732
00:52:54.069 --> 00:52:59.619
damn thing afterwards.
So yeah, I know

733
00:52:59.619 --> 00:53:02.519
how to fix a fence.

734
00:53:20.789 --> 00:53:25.180
Thank you for your help.
Got a lot of chores

735
00:53:25.180 --> 00:53:31.000
to do before the movie starts.
Yeah.

736
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.390
See you around.

737
00:53:34.319 --> 00:53:39.000
See you at the media training.

738
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.650
I'm Brecken Nichols,
media consultant in charge of PR

739
00:53:41.650 --> 00:53:43.269
for the fortune bottle.
You will be required

740
00:53:43.269 --> 00:53:44.890
to help promote the movie so we need

741
00:53:44.890 --> 00:53:45.670
to make sure that you handle

742
00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:47.019
yourself with confidence and

743
00:53:47.019 --> 00:53:48.759
professionalism.
We're going to review

744
00:53:48.759 --> 00:53:50.619
posture, smiling for
the camera, jargons

745
00:53:50.619 --> 00:53:53.549
and abstractions.
Set up straight. Okay.

746
00:53:53.549 --> 00:54:00.450
Hold yourself with poise.
It just-

748
00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:18.610

stick up your ass.

750
00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:23.000
Glad I'm not the only one she hates.
Grab some lunch.

751
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.090
I'll work with her for a bit.

752
00:54:25.090 --> 00:54:27.550
You know, I don't eat.
Neither should you

753
00:54:27.550 --> 00:54:34.000
by the way.
- Who is she?

754
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:38.120
I'm going to turn of the camera.

755
00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:50.200
How many you guys have worked on so far?
- Uh, something about jargon and

756
00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:53.890
abstractions.
As you can see it's gone

757
00:54:53.890 --> 00:54:57.500
real well.
- You don't have to worry about jargon.

758
00:54:57.500 --> 00:55:00.730
You're Southern, that's okay.
Okay.

759
00:55:00.730 --> 00:55:04.930
We don't need you to change that.
Ordinance,

760
00:55:04.930 --> 00:55:10.420
though, might be a problem for you.
Rambling.

761
00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:13.960
Don't ramble. Abstractions.
The verbal fillers,

762
00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:15.820
that 'you knows', the 'uhhs'-

763
00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:20.040
I know, I know.
The fidgeting, blinking,

764
00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:24.900
Summer, look at me.

765
00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:32.260
Forget the rules.
Just ask me a question.

766
00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:39.099
- What kind of question?
- Any kind of question.

767
00:55:44.059 --> 00:55:47.079
Are you in pain?

768
00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:53.089
You don't seem upset about her leaving.

769
00:55:53.089 --> 00:56:01.239
Don't ramble.
Be concise and don't look away.

770
00:56:01.239 --> 00:56:04.989
That indicates shame.

771
00:56:08.730 --> 00:56:10.600
Nadia and I were together for a long time.

772
00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:14.160
Whenever you lose someone after a

773
00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:19.160
long time, it hurts.
But I think it's for the best.

774
00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:21.660
She's happier in her new relationship.

775
00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:26.890
And that's what I want.
For her to be happy.

776
00:56:31.890 --> 00:56:32.640
That's what I would say if a reporter

777
00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:35.940
asked.
It would put me on the

778
00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:39.549
high road and subtly turned
everyone against her.

779
00:56:42.549 --> 00:56:47.700
Is it the truth?

780
00:56:47.100 --> 00:57:01.270
No. Feel very odd about Nadia.
I feel stupid.

781
00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:03.740
I feel off balance.

782
00:57:03.740 --> 00:57:07.570
I feel taken advantage of.

783
00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:16.440
I like that answer better.
So would the press.

784
00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:19.550
The truth is always more

785
00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:33.670
Do you feel closer to me now?

786
00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:43.700
Having heard that?
- Yeah.

787
00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:47.000
If the public knows you, Summer.
They will destroy you.

788
00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:51.260
I can't help themselves.
They love our weaknesses

789
00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:55.700
so much, that they dig deeper,
they feast

790
00:57:55.700 --> 00:57:59.180
and pillage on our exposures until we

791
00:57:59.180 --> 00:58:04.960
ask people- you as Summer,
me as Cole-are gone.

792
00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:08.390
And all there's left is what they want

793
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:17.640
to see. Any other questions?
- What?

794
00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:21.690
- Ask it.
- Were you telling the truth when you said,

795
00:58:21.690 --> 00:58:25.100
I was a bad kisser?

796
00:58:26.510 --> 00:58:35.250
No. -No.
- Be concise. Don't ramble.

797
00:58:35.250 --> 00:58:37.560
I suppose being evasive is one of the

798
00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:40.490
rules also, right?
- Yeah, actually it is.

799
00:58:40.490 --> 00:58:46.230
Anytime you can be evasive, you should.
- Wait!

800
00:58:52.450 --> 00:59:07.070
Thank you. It's been a while
I needed to hear that.
-It's been a while since you were kissed?

809

Now there's a long list of my name on

848
01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:58.980
top of her.

849
01:07:00.310 --> 01:07:03.609
Please leave, Cole.

[Music]

851
01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:41.200
God sent his Son so we might-
- What? Now? I'm sorry.

852
01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:49.110
Sunday. Only Yankees
would think that

853
01:07:49.110 --> 01:07:50.910
would be an appropriate time to thrust

854
01:07:50.910 --> 01:07:53.340
themselves into our lives.

855
01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:57.179
[Music]

856
01:07:57.500 --> 01:08:03.990
- Come on.
- Summer, I imagine you're ready

857
01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:07.250
for your big day tomorrow.

858
01:08:11.130 --> 01:08:17.249
Don't you mind them, honey.
- I don't. I just don't

859
01:08:17.249 --> 01:08:18.019
feel great.

860
01:08:18.019 --> 01:08:24.339
You're probably going to help me anyway.

861
01:08:25.339 --> 01:08:30.929
I'm an idiot.
- You're not an idiot.

862
01:08:30.929 --> 01:08:34.359
No, I'm an idiot.
- You're not gonna get pregnant, are you?

863
01:08:34.359 --> 01:08:35.500
Because that would make you an idiot.

864
01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:39.569
No. I have a morning-after pill.
- You bagged a movie star. You should be

865
01:08:39.569 --> 01:08:43.189
bragging on Twitter and
throwing a fucking party.

866
01:08:44.189 --> 01:08:48.900
Seriously, Ben. How much if
I did mess this up?
- By screwing your co-star?

867
01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:50.520
Honey, you wouldn't be Hollywood if you

868
01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:52.400
didn't bang a co-star at some point.

869
01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:54.900
It's nothing.
Don't let it affect your performance?

870
01:08:55.750 --> 01:08:57.779
- I won't.
- It's a good thing

871
01:08:57.779 --> 01:08:59.609
my character hates it and we started

872
01:08:59.609 --> 01:09:02.759
filming more now.
I just want to get this movie

873
01:09:02.759 --> 01:09:05.939
out the way and leave town.
Forget my past and forget Cole.

874
01:09:05.939 --> 01:09:08.939
Masten.

875
01:09:12.550 --> 01:09:17.840
When do you leave?
- A few days. No more beer.

876
01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:20.060
Now let's bring you into the 21st century

877
01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:24.670
and get you a cell phone.

878
01:09:38.139 --> 01:09:41.000
Cocky tried to crow this morning.

879
01:09:41.559 --> 01:09:42.759
I was in the kitchen when
I heard him in the yard.

880
01:09:42.759 --> 01:09:45.729
First, I thought it was hurt.

881
01:09:45.729 --> 01:09:49.179
I know I've heard it when they learn it.

882
01:09:49.179 --> 01:09:52.960
Takes him a while to figure it out.
- Yeah.

883
01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:54.368
It was pathetic.

884
01:09:54.368 --> 01:10:00.000
I was embarrassed for him.
- Oh, he'll learn.

885
01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.329
And when he does, he'll do it
all hours of the day.

886
01:10:04.329 --> 01:10:07.500
Not just at dawn like in the movies.

887
01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:10.980
Gotta love Hollywood, right?

888
01:10:17.810 --> 01:10:21.290
Do you need something?

889
01:10:22.850 --> 01:10:30.790
- Are we good?
- Stay out of my way and we'll be just fine.

890
01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:35.910
- I don't chase, Summer.
- This is not a game!

891
01:10:35.910 --> 01:10:38.870
I'm not saying one thing and meaning another.

892
01:10:38.870 --> 01:10:44.000
Leave me alone.
- I was wrong about you.

893
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.470
You're a terrible actress.

894
01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:21.790
It's my money, and I think
I know how I want to spend it.

895
01:11:22.790 --> 01:11:25.900
Honey, you don't want to invest in refreshments.

896
01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:27.630
Let the boys

897
01:11:27.630 --> 01:11:29.900
downtown give you a
Certificate of Deposit

898
01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:31.200
for that money.

899
01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:35.160
Or bonds. Bonds are a
great safe place for

900
01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:37.500
your little inheritance to sit.

901
01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:40.260
Don't talk down to me.
If I wanted to let my money

902
01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:41.620
and smoke it like your cheap cigars,

903
01:11:41.620 --> 01:11:45.800
I'll do so. I believe in this product,

904
01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:48.360
just as much as you and all the other

905
01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:52.190
investors. I want in.

906
01:12:08.349 --> 01:12:10.550
Thank you, Mr. Mitchell.

907
01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:12.320
Some of the investors aren't wild about

908
01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:14.570
having a woman on board, Miss Pinkerton.

909
01:12:14.570 --> 01:12:17.000
And what would your opinion be on the matter?

910
01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:23.179
I love women. Then again,
you already knew that,

911
01:12:23.179 --> 01:12:26.389
didn't you, Ms. Pinkerton?
- I have no idea

912
01:12:26.389 --> 01:12:30.130
what you're talking about, Mr. Mitchell.

913
01:12:32.260 --> 01:12:38.929
Don't touch me!
- I'm sorry, Country. I thought you liked it

914
01:12:38.929 --> 01:12:39.920
when I touched you.

915
01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:46.590
CUT! What the fuck was that?
- Ask your golden boy here.

916
01:12:46.590 --> 01:12:50.199
He put condoms in my suitcase.

917
01:12:50.199 --> 01:12:53.360
Is that too racy for you Southern belles?

918
01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:54.900
Relax, Summer. It's a prank.

919
01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:56.360
Stop it, you two!

920
01:12:56.360 --> 01:13:00.509
I did not sign on to referee.
Let's wrap for today.

921
01:13:02.509 --> 01:14:04.790
It's fine. It's funny.
- Look at her.

922
01:13:09.790 --> 01:13:13.950
So did we get it?
- I think so, despite your best efforts.

923
01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:18.980
She needed her feathers ruffled a little.

924
01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:22.460
She's getting too tense.

925
01:13:24.460 --> 01:13:29.530
It's my money and I think I know
how I want to spend it.
- Honey,

926
01:13:29.530 --> 01:13:32.540
you don't want to invest in refreshments.
Let the boys

927
01:13:32.540 --> 01:13:35.119
downtown give you a Certificate
of Deposit for that money.

928
01:13:35.119 --> 01:13:41.699
Or bonds. Bonds are a great, a safe
place for your little inheritance to sit.

929
01:13:41.699 --> 01:13:45.349
Don't talk down to me. If I
wanted to light my money and smoke it

930
01:13:45.349 --> 01:13:49.340
like your cheap cigars, I'll do so.
But I believe

931
01:13:49.340 --> 01:13:51.079
in this product just as much as you

932
01:13:51.079 --> 01:13:56.969
or any of the other investors.
And I want in.

933
01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:09.800
Thank you, Mr. Mitchell.
- It's good. Beauty changes when she's mad.

934
01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:13.570
Another reason to push her buttons.

935
01:14:14.570 --> 01:14:16.500
Do want to show him the other cut?
- Yeah, roll it.

936
01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:20.150
- What? What cut?
- I have no idea what

937
01:14:20.150 --> 01:14:23.710
you're talking about, Mr. Mitchell.

938
01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:37.359

939
01:14:40.030 --> 01:14:47.400
- So?
- What's the purpose of that cut?

940
01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:48.050
It's hot.

941
01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:49.520
I mean, I've got a hard-on just from

942
01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:51.620
watching it. Look, Mr. Masten,

943
01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:53.750
The other stuff is good but
this stuff has emotion.

944
01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:55.489
It's got heat.
You two look like you're

945
01:14:55.489 --> 01:14:56.900
moments away from banging right there on

946
01:14:56.900 --> 01:14:58.659
the desk.

947
01:14:58.659 --> 01:15:02.300
He's right. I hate like hell to say it,

948
01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:06.600
but he's right.
- We can't use this. It's too-

949
01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:08.390
Real? Ida and Royce hate each other.
That’s

950
01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:10.880
already in there.
But if we can use that

951
01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:13.610
hatred to make sexual tension, it'll

952
01:15:13.610 --> 01:15:16.000
bring up a whole other element into the film.

953
01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.630
And it would bring in the female viewers

954
01:15:17.630 --> 01:15:19.610
who, right now, we have no draw on,

955
01:15:19.610 --> 01:15:22.969
other than your pretty mug.

956
01:15:22.969 --> 01:15:25.640
- She would never go for it.
- Since when does that matter?

957
01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:31.000
She doesn't have script approval.

958
01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:35.710
Okay, let's do it.

- Hi, Gus.
- Hey, Summer.

961
01:15:48.330 --> 01:15:52.679
- Is that Cocky?
- Friendly thing. You know,
I heard Cole Masten keeps him in the house.

962
01:15:52.679 --> 01:15:53.850
Yeah?

963
01:15:53.850 --> 01:15:57.239
Where'd you hear that?
- Around. Drove him here

964
01:15:57.239 --> 01:16:00.469
this morning in his truck.

965
01:16:01.469 --> 01:16:03.420
Good morning. I've put the

966
01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:05.520
Sides and updated Call sheet in here.
- Great.

967
01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:06.150
Thank you.

968
01:16:06.150 --> 01:16:07.260
There is a new scene so you want to

969
01:16:07.260 --> 01:16:10.639
review it before your call time.
- Okay.

970
01:16:13.340 --> 01:16:18.780
There's a kiss.
There is no love story

971
01:16:18.780 --> 01:16:21.210
between Ida and Royce.
I have read the book.

972
01:16:21.210 --> 01:16:24.590
Three times.
- I saw that in the damn book.

973
01:16:24.590 --> 01:16:27.449
It's the movie. Writers are adding

974
01:16:27.449 --> 01:16:28.889
the excitement. If you're
in the business, you know.

975
01:16:28.889 --> 01:16:31.690
It's normal.
- You know I've read the script.

976
01:16:31.690 --> 01:16:35.850
Ida and Royce hate each.
Why would Royce suddenly

977
01:16:35.850 --> 01:16:37.650
pushes Ida against the file cabinet

978
01:16:37.650 --> 01:16:39.389
and kisses her passionately.
It is stupid.

979
01:16:39.389 --> 01:16:41.429
The passion from their hatred will make

980
01:16:41.429 --> 01:16:44.790
it hotter.
- No, it doesn't make it hotter.

981
01:16:44.790 --> 01:16:48.360
It makes it stupid.
I swear if he kisses me.

982
01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:52.320
I'll be losing.
- Yes you will. You'll

983
01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:55.739
fall apart under my mouth, baby.
- Please.

984
01:16:55.739 --> 01:17:00.310
Don't flatter yourself.
I don't even like you.

985
01:17:02.310 --> 01:18:03.909
Stupid side!

986
01:17:10.909 --> 01:17:16.120
- Well, that went well.
- What did you expect?
We threw this on her without warning.

987
01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:19.530
I told you. We should meet with
her this morning go over

988
01:17:19.530 --> 01:17:21.600
the changes to prepare her.
But no,

989
01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:23.909
you wanted to dump it on her via call

990
01:17:23.909 --> 01:17:29.429
sheets and sides.
- Dump it on her. I was one of the

991
01:17:29.429 --> 01:17:30.170
hottest man alive last year.

992
01:17:30.170 --> 01:17:33.239
It's not like she has to
mentally adjust to a war camp.

993
01:17:33.239 --> 01:17:36.739
How hard can it be to kiss me?

994
01:17:37.509 --> 01:17:40.909
It's actually three kisses and a grope.

995
01:17:43.409 --> 01:17:48.070
I'll go talk to her.
- No! With my luck,

996
01:17:48.070 --> 01:17:50.619
you two would make up and any
authenticity to the scene

997
01:17:50.619 --> 01:17:53.749
will disappear.
Just stay away from her.

998
01:17:53.489 --> 01:17:57.370
Cole! Cole!

1001
01:18:07.270 --> 01:18:10.990

01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:28.370
- Yeah?
- I need in California tomorrow
morning. You've been

1006
01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:29.900
summoned.
It's an initial play

1007
01:18:29.900 --> 01:18:31.790
mediation. I've arranged
it with your director.

1008
01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:34.250
Shoot your scene then get you ass

1009
01:18:34.250 --> 01:18:36.410
to LA.
- Good.

1010
01:18:40.410 --> 01:18:43.270
This is stupid.
- What's the problem, Summer?

1011
01:18:43.270 --> 01:18:46.700
Royce gives Ida a car,
and in return, she kisses him.

1012
01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:47.660
It's a peace offering.

1013
01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:50.750
I would never accept a car.
She certainly

1014
01:18:50.750 --> 01:18:52.280
wouldn't be jumping up and down doing

1015
01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:52.840
this whole pathetic routine,
you guys,

1016
01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:55.790
have all these screwed.
- It's not

1017
01:18:55.790 --> 01:18:56.570
pathetic.

1018
01:18:56.570 --> 01:18:59.270
It's how women in the forties acted.

1019
01:18:59.270 --> 01:19:01.220
You have to realize she's a divorced woman

1020
01:19:01.220 --> 01:19:03.920
looking for a man.
Royce is giving her a

1021
01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:07.130
very generous gift,
and when she hugs him

1022
01:19:07.130 --> 01:19:10.010
in gratitude,
he goes in for the kiss.

1023
01:19:10.010 --> 01:19:13.160
It's logical.
- It is logical if she's a woman

1024
01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:15.380
sits at home all day knitting.
It is not

1025
01:19:15.380 --> 01:19:17.510
logical for Ida Pinkerton,
one of the

1026
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:27.810
Original 67. Am I the only
one that read the book?
- Script aren't the book. It's an adaptation.

1027
01:19:29.810 --> 01:19:35.560
Summer, I gotta get on a plan in two hours.
Please, don't fight me on this.

1028
01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:41.690
You're leaving?
- Yeah, I gotta go home, rather, Los

1029
01:19:41.690 --> 01:19:45.230
Angeles for the night.
My home is under

1030
01:19:45.230 --> 01:19:47.960
the control of my ex.
- Are you gonna stay?

1031
01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:51.230
That came out wrong.

1032
01:19:51.230 --> 01:19:54.860
Nevermind.
- I'm at the hotel. I'm meeting with

1033
01:19:54.860 --> 01:19:57.190
the lawyers tomorrow about the divorce.

1034
01:19:57.190 --> 01:20:01.010
Can we just please,
say our lines and get this baby

1035
01:20:01.010 --> 01:20:03.400
wrapped up?
- But it's not real

1036
01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:06.300
I don't want to do this.
This is not a character.

1037
01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:08.390
Then ad lib it.
Just like you did in the office.

1038
01:20:08.900 --> 01:20:12.210
But in return I need a kiss.

1039
01:20:12.210 --> 01:20:16.530
- Yes.
- Yes, I know,

1040
01:20:16.530 --> 01:20:19.740
painful. Trust me, Country.
I'm not looking

1041
01:20:19.740 --> 01:20:26.970
forward anymore than you are.
- Liar.

1042
01:20:26.970 --> 01:20:29.010
Yes, baby. And so are you.

1043
01:20:29.010 --> 01:20:31.970
- Let's roll.
- Lock it down.

1044
01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:46.250
Do you mind watching Cocky
for me while I'm gone?

1045
01:20:46.690 --> 01:20:50.800
Of cource.
- Just don't want him to be alone.

1046
01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:54.210
I could take him over to my place.

1047
01:20:54.210 --> 01:21:00.200
Or I'm cooking over yours.
- Yeah, if you don't mind.

1048
01:21:00.150 --> 01:21:04.610
That's better for Cocky.

And, action!

1051
01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:24.040
Well, Miss Pinkerton,
what do you think?

1052
01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:26.180
Very impressive.

1053
01:21:26.180 --> 01:21:30.500
Do you decorate all your new cars,
Mr. Mitchell.

1054
01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:34.720
- It's for you.
- Me?

1055
01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:40.220
- Yes. It's red.
- I'm a woman, Mr. Mitchell.

1056
01:21:40.220 --> 01:21:43.820
- Not colourblind.
- You are  also not very

1057
01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:48.080
appreciative. It's soda
bottle beer. I had

1058
01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:49.990
a dealership mix the colour just for you.

1059
01:21:49.850 --> 01:21:54.020
How very generous of you.
Where's my car?

1060
01:21:54.020 --> 01:21:58.370
- This is your new car.
- I'm not deaf, colourblind,

1061
01:21:58.370 --> 01:22:02.330
or stupid.
I can see that the car is red.

1062
01:22:02.330 --> 01:22:06.500
However, you are of some misunderstanding

1063
01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:08.810
that I would be happy to accept this

1064
01:22:08.810 --> 01:22:12.470
from you.
Well, indeed. That is my

1065
01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:15.200
misunderstanding, Miss Pinkerton.
But I'm glad

1066
01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:16.820
that for once today we are on the

1067
01:22:16.820 --> 01:22:18.850
same page.

1068
01:22:18.850 --> 01:22:23.000
- Where's my car? The black Ford.
- Well, I'm not

1069
01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.430
entirely sure.
- Could you focus at the matter

1070
01:22:25.430 --> 01:22:27.340
at hand.
- Get it back.

1071
01:22:28.340 --> 01:22:31.130
- You don't want it back.
- You don't know what I want.

1072
01:22:31.130 --> 01:22:35.440
I know you want this.

01:23:14.130 --> 01:23:16.310
Mr. Mitchell.
- About what?

1076
01:23:19.310 --> 01:23:21.620
I don't want it.
- And us?

1077
01:23:21.620 --> 01:23:28.139
I don't want the car and I'd
appreciated it if you got mine back.

1078
01:23:28.139 --> 01:23:31.550
Understood, Miss Pinkerton.

1079
01:23:31.550 --> 01:23:36.060
Enjoy your long walk home.

1080
01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:45.510
And cut!

1081
01:23:45.510 --> 01:23:47.220

Hey, it's Cole.
Just wanna check and see if

1084
01:25:22.370 --> 01:25:25.460
your new cell phone's working
- It's working.

1085
01:25:33.809 --> 01:25:34.000
Summer?

1086
01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:39.600
- Mm-hmm?
- Did you just fall asleep?

1087
01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:42.149
- Uh-huh.
- Do you know how many girls would kill

1088
01:25:42.149 --> 01:25:44.939
for me to call them? Studios run

1089
01:25:44.939 --> 01:25:46.379
giveaways and shit like this all the time,

1090
01:25:46.379 --> 01:25:52.479
and million's girls would sign up.
- Girls. Not women.

1091
01:25:53.479 --> 01:25:56.009
You know I used to want a belly button ring.

1092
01:25:59.009 --> 01:26:10.789
I am NOT a belly button ring.
Where are you right now?

1093
01:26:10.789 --> 01:26:21.209
Which room?
-Yours. I hope that's okay.

1094
01:26:21.209 --> 01:26:23.719
What are you wearing?

1095
01:26:26.339 --> 01:26:33.389
Cole Masten, I am not doing this with you.
-I am asking purely out of

1096
01:26:33.389 --> 01:26:36.239
concern for cocky.
He's never seen a

1097
01:26:36.239 --> 01:26:38.519
naked woman before. I worry about his

1098
01:26:38.519 --> 01:26:52.689
poultry hormones.
- Poultry hormones. Cocky's just fine.
I'm not naked.

1099
01:26:53.860 --> 01:26:55.889
I'm wearing an underwear.

1100
01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:06.190
- And a tank top?
- No.

1101
01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:16.930
I was hot and I'm going to sleep.

1102
01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:26.320
- No, you shouldn't.
- Uh, this is wrong.

1103
01:27:26.260 --> 01:27:33.289
Summer, I am a rock hard and all I can think

1104
01:27:33.289 --> 01:27:37.250
about is you in my bed. Please, don't

1105
01:27:37.250 --> 01:27:42.559
torture me by hanging up the phone.

1106
01:27:42.559 --> 01:27:47.630
- You're thinking of me?
- I've been thinking about you all day.

1107
01:27:47.630 --> 01:28:02.900
I wish you're here so you can reach
over and feel me right now.
- I've never done this before and
I don't know what to say.

1108
01:28:03.900 --> 01:28:10.600
You don't have to say anything
just touch yourself. Have you ever
touched yourself before?

1109
01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:22.130
Oh, yes. I've been single for 3 years.
I can cum myself to orgasm pretty quickly.

1110
01:28:23.940 --> 01:28:57.840
I want to be with you so bad.

1111
01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:46.090
I wish it didn't end so quickly.
I've thought about it all the time.

1112
01:28:46.090 --> 01:28:51.370
- You have?
- Yeah.

1113
01:28:53.370 --> 01:29:04.760
Tomorrow night, stay at my house.
The minute I get off that plane,
I'll drive there, and I will pin
you down on my bed and I'll worship you.

1114
01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:17.090
And I won't let you up until my mouth
imprinted on your mind and your taste
is my middle fucking name.

1115
01:29:56.530 --> 01:30:00.470
- It's for the movie.
- No. This is different.

1116
01:30:00.470 --> 01:30:03.300
I've known you for 13 years.

1117
01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:06.600
And how serious are you about her?
- Serious? She's my co-star.

1118
01:30:06.110 --> 01:30:09.830
Please. Nadia's team

1119
01:30:09.830 --> 01:30:11.060
breathing down my neck, and that

1120
01:30:11.060 --> 01:30:13.100
Rottweiler of an attorney you tied me to

1121
01:30:13.100 --> 01:30:15.290
threatening my nuts in a jar if I so

1122
01:30:15.290 --> 01:30:16.910
much as unzip my pants.

1123
01:30:16.910 --> 01:30:19.660
What is this?
Some sort of rebound or-

1124
01:30:19.660 --> 01:30:26.210
- I wouldn't do that to her.
- To Summer?

1125
01:30:26.210 --> 01:30:32.780
Fuck me. Are you in love?

1126
01:30:32.780 --> 01:30:34.300
The mediation is starting soon.
We should go.

1127
01:30:36.300 --> 01:30:38.660
Well, who let you in? This is

1128
01:30:38.660 --> 01:30:40.200
supposed to be a private cafe.
- Get the fuck out of here.

1129
01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:41.420
And let me talk to my client alone.

1130
01:30:41.420 --> 01:30:43.910
Let's just go outside and make sure no one

1131
01:30:43.910 --> 01:30:45.500
gets in here.
- Okay.

1132
01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:50.100
I really don't want to listen
to one of your lectures today.

1133
01:30:50.100 --> 01:30:50.900
Mm-mhmm.

1134
01:30:50.900 --> 01:30:54.710
Was your assistant correct?
I mean if it

1135
01:30:54.710 --> 01:30:55.730
is something else and just let me know.

1136
01:30:55.730 --> 01:30:58.060
We can attack it from a different side.

1137
01:30:58.060 --> 01:31:01.660
What are you talking about?

1138
01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:11.120
Walk.

1139
01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:14.040
I've been told to stay away
from someone before.

1140
01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:16.310
Made me chase her down like she

1141
01:31:16.310 --> 01:31:20.180
was some kind of wounded gazelle.

1142
01:31:20.180 --> 01:31:24.380
She ended up being my soulmate.
- So now you're saying

1143
01:31:24.380 --> 01:31:26.840
that I can date her?
- I'm saying that I need

1144
01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:29.750
to know what's going on so I can control

1145
01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:32.200
the media.
More importantly, the judge

1146
01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:35.180
and Nadia's take on it.
I can't do my job

1147
01:31:35.180 --> 01:31:40.010
if you're keeping things from me.
- Honestly,

1148
01:31:40.010 --> 01:31:42.200
I don't know what's going on with this girl?

1149
01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:45.990
That's the truth.

1150
01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:51.350
Cole will get the boat, plane,
the Montana ranch

1151
01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:54.230
in the Fortune Bottle.
Nadia will get the California

1152
01:31:54.230 --> 01:31:56.510
and Hawaii real estate.
All bank accounts

1153
01:31:56.510 --> 01:31:58.280
will go to their respective owners with

1154
01:31:58.280 --> 01:32:02.150
joint accounts split evenly.
Nadia do you agree

1155
01:32:02.150 --> 01:32:05.830
with the basics of this agreement?

1156
01:32:22.399 --> 01:32:26.599
I suppose so, yes.
Cole, do you agree with the

1157
01:32:26.599 --> 01:32:30.090
basics of this agreement?
- I do.

1158
01:32:30.090 --> 01:32:34.500
Now, if you'll excuse me
I have to get back to set.

1159
01:32:36.500 --> 01:32:39.999

Miss Pinkerton, it seems to me that
you have a bit of an attitude problem.

01:34:00.790 --> 01:34:04.120
Coming to my office telling me

1170
01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:06.010
how to run my business isn't quite how

1171
01:34:06.010 --> 01:34:08.320
we do business here at Quincy, is it?

1172
01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:16.330
I must tell you after every time you've

1173
01:34:16.330 --> 01:34:20.920
been in here, I've felt, oh- this is

1174
01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:23.900
bullshit!
Learn your marks and stay on them.

1175
01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:25.690
You've changed your marks five

1176
01:34:25.690 --> 01:34:27.760
times in the past two hours. If you make

1177
01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:31.080
up your mind. It won't be a problem.

You touch me again,
I'll put you in your mark

1179
01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:39.100
and hold you there.
- Cut! Okay, Summer,

1180
01:34:39.100 --> 01:34:43.450
Cole, Let's, uh, let's take five.
Brecken, not now.

1181
01:34:43.450 --> 01:34:45.400
We're filming. Press issues can wait.

1182
01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:47.950
No. No. This cannot wait.
- What's the problem?

1183
01:34:47.950 --> 01:34:52.980
It's not with you. It was Summer.

1184
01:34:56.579 --> 01:34:59.900
How did I not know this?
How did we not know this?

1185
01:35:01.790 --> 01:35:02.250
We didn't think we needed to do a full

1186
01:35:02.250 --> 01:35:04.320
workup on her. I mean, look at her.

1187
01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:06.840
We ran background criminal, porn searches-

1188
01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:08.340
did the blood work. Everything came back

1189
01:35:08.340 --> 01:35:14.699
clean.
- It wasn't a big deal. It was a long

1190
01:35:14.699 --> 01:35:19.139
time ago.
- So this is something you

1191
01:35:19.139 --> 01:35:23.730
already know about?
- My Rehearsal Dinner?

1192
01:35:23.730 --> 01:35:28.610
No. The Rehearsal Dinner from Hell!

1193
01:35:29.610 --> 01:35:33.929
Why didn't you tell us about this?
- Clear the room.

1194
01:35:33.929 --> 01:35:36.139
I need to speak to Summer alone.

1195
01:35:48.139 --> 01:35:51.719
You should have told us.
We can control

1196
01:35:51.719 --> 01:35:54.300
something that we know about.
This, we can't

1197
01:35:54.300 --> 01:35:57.960
control. Right now,
every tabloid in America

1198
01:35:57.960 --> 01:35:59.730
has somebody getting it on a plane

1199
01:35:59.730 --> 01:36:02.639
to Quincy.
When they get here, they're

1200
01:36:02.639 --> 01:36:04.650
gonna find every single friend of yours,

1201
01:36:04.650 --> 01:36:07.380
and every Chatty Cathy and talk to them.

1202
01:36:07.380 --> 01:36:12.510
I don't care.
- You will care. You may not care

1203
01:36:12.510 --> 01:36:14.969
right at this very second but trust me

1204
01:36:14.969 --> 01:36:18.300
you will care.
- I have been an outcast in this

1205
01:36:18.300 --> 01:36:24.050
town for three years.
You think I care

1206
01:36:24.050 --> 01:36:26.849
about what some soccer mom in Nebraska thinks

1207
01:36:26.849 --> 01:36:29.219
of me.
- It's not just soccer moms

1208
01:36:29.219 --> 01:36:34.000
in Nebraska.
It's everyone in the industry.

1209
01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.900
You know what I think,
this industry is bullshit.

1210
01:36:36.900 --> 01:36:40.600
It's the one-off thing for me.
After this, I'm leaving.

1211
01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:43.650
You get a lead role in a feature film,

1212
01:36:43.650 --> 01:36:47.090
and you're just gonna disappear?

1213
01:36:49.010 --> 01:36:52.010
Yeah.

1214
01:36:56.580 --> 01:37:00.770
You're not like any other
woman I have ever met.

1215
01:37:03.770 --> 01:37:05.960
Thank you.

1216
01:37:06.290 --> 01:37:09.600
Whether you value your reputation or not

1217
01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:12.600
you need to talk to Brecken.
Let her do her thing.

1218
01:37:13.390 --> 01:37:15.500
You may have to go on a couple of talk show.

1219
01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:16.999
Just tell your side of story.

1220
01:37:16.999 --> 01:37:18.900
No. I don't want to talk about it.

1221
01:37:24.900 --> 01:37:27.000
You don't want to talk about it on camera

1222
01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:33.230
or you don't want to talk to me?

1223
01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.060
How do you care?

1224
01:37:40.060 --> 01:37:44.700
I need to know if I should have
ambulances on speed dial for my crew.

1225
01:37:46.580 --> 01:37:49.910
I'll be worried about the crew.

1226
01:37:49.910 --> 01:37:54.200
I'd be more worried about yourself,
Mr. Masten.

1227
01:37:56.060 --> 01:37:58.490
Don't do that.

1228
01:37:58.490 --> 01:38:03.870
Don't call me that. Not here.

1229
01:38:03.870 --> 01:38:10.920
Then where, Mr. Masten?

1230
01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:14.730
I'm not playing this game with you.
I showed up for the house last night

1231
01:38:14.730 --> 01:38:16.010
with an erection the size of Texas.

1232
01:38:17.010 --> 01:38:20.200
And you weren't there.
- I'm here right now.

1233
01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:24.090
Not here.
I did a half-ass job with you

1234
01:38:24.090 --> 01:38:27.550
the last time.
I'm not gonna make that mistake again.

1235
01:38:28.550 --> 01:38:33.180
And I do care, Summer. Just stop

1236
01:38:33.180 --> 01:38:39.300
pushing me away.
You could use a friend right now

1237
01:38:40.060 --> 01:38:41.000
A friend?

1238
01:38:41.300 --> 01:38:45.309
Will you stop hating me for
just 10 minutes and let me-

1239
01:38:45.309 --> 01:38:47.980
I don't hate you.

1240
01:38:51.469 --> 01:38:53.059
You liked me?
It terrifies me.

1241
01:38:57.059 --> 01:39:00.949
Perhaps, you and I more
similar than I thought.

1242
01:39:00.949 --> 01:39:04.559
We both react, rather, passionately to

1243
01:39:04.559 --> 01:39:07.500
betrayal.
I did try to kill a man with a

1244
01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:10.820
porcelain elephant.
- [Chuckles]

1245
01:39:24.250 --> 01:39:26.870
Tell me what happened.

1246
01:39:27.870 --> 01:39:31.980
It's crazy. What I did that night?

1247
01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:35.380
[Music]

1248
01:39:35.380 --> 01:39:38.330
Three days before my wedding, I found out

1249
01:39:38.330 --> 01:39:40.600
my fiancée was sleeping with
my maid of honour.

1250
01:39:41.340 --> 01:39:45.760
Turns out I was just about the
last person in town to find out.

1251
01:39:48.500 --> 01:39:51.000
Should have called off the wedding.

1252
01:39:51.349 --> 01:39:54.609
But I didn't.

1253
01:39:56.609 --> 01:40:00.500
If a kid, or stupid adult or an animal
eats something that they shouldn't,

1254
01:40:00.500 --> 01:40:02.639
they feed them Ipecac.

1255
01:40:03.639 --> 01:40:09.550
Oh, it caused a violent vomiting
spell that got out all the nasty.

1256
01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.519
So it was very easy to set up.

1257
01:40:12.519 --> 01:40:15.619
The restaurant was serving crème brulee

1258
01:40:15.619 --> 01:40:20.709
for dessert, topped with a medley of berries.

1259
01:40:22.709 --> 01:40:27.199
I like to say I hesitated
but that'd be a lie.

1260
01:40:28.199 --> 01:40:31.000
Two days of pent up anger,

1261
00:01:40.023 --> 01:40:25.499
an hour of polite dinner

1262
01:40:33.499 --> 01:40:37.539
conversation with false friends.

1263
01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:41.059
It all pushed me to my actions.

1264
01:40:43.640 --> 01:41:21.940

[Music]

1267
01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:48.730
It was evil what I did.
In front of everyone.

1268
01:41:48.730 --> 01:41:52.190
Especially Quincy where appearances matter.

1269
01:41:52.190 --> 01:41:55.910
The town never forgave me.

1270
01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:01.600
That was my last moment of glory
and the Quincy sun.

1271
01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:03.890
You don't need them.

1272
01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:13.220
And that is why I'm taking
my money starting a new life.

1273
01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:17.060
That's why you asked about
the money right away.

1274
01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.960
Get out of here.

1275
01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:29.080
One of the most appealing things
about you, Country.

1276
01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:35.340
Means your freedom.
I was infuriating as it has been.

1277
01:42:35.340 --> 01:42:38.860
You always say and act I feel.

1278
01:42:42.860 --> 01:42:50.690
I want to propose something.
It's Friday night,

1279
01:42:50.690 --> 01:42:53.630
We don't have to work tomorrow.

1280
01:42:54.500 --> 01:42:58.800
Spend the night with me and for the next

1281
01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:00.440
24 hours,

1282
01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:08.000
no fighting. Just us together.

1283
01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:10.380
Okay.

1284
01:43:24.380 --> 01:43:26.670
Cole! Summer! We need to deal with it!

1285
01:43:28.750 --> 01:43:34.530
Tonight. My place. I'll handle this.

1286
01:44:17.750 --> 01:44:18.320
You came.

1287
01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:20.200
Yeah.

1288
01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:28.000
I brought condoms.

1289
01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:35.000
I have condoms. Thank you.

1290
01:44:35.320 --> 01:44:38.060
Where is your bag?

1291
01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:40.060
I didn't bring mine. I thought-

1292
01:44:43.060 --> 01:44:46.870
You're staying the night.

1293
01:44:52.530 --> 01:44:57.350
Are you hungry?
I grilled up some steaks.

1294
01:44:57.350 --> 01:45:01.850
- Steaks?
- We don't have to-

1295
01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:03.890
No. No, steaks are great.

1296
01:45:03.890 --> 01:46:07.010
Yeah. I can make some sides.

1297
01:45:12.930 --> 01:45:15.170
Never had okra.

1298
01:45:15.930 --> 01:45:19.000
- Oh, you're in for a treat. City boy.

[Music]

1300
01:45:52.489 --> 01:45:55.600
She definitely seems to recognize
me when I take her treat.

1301
01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:58.019
When I ask the feed store about the treats,

1302
01:45:58.019 --> 01:46:00.439
I got laughed out of there.

1303
01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
You just leave these.
Girls come on Monday.

1304
01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:09.209
Monday? It is Friday.

1305
01:46:09.209 --> 01:46:12.399
I'm not leaving a sink full of dirty dishes.

1306
01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:15.749
Let's just clear the food off and

1307
01:46:15.749 --> 01:46:19.280
set the plates down on the counter.

How do you think this thing's going between us?

1311
01:46:50.500 --> 01:46:52.000
Cole.

1312
01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Come here.

01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:08.000
I've been dreaming of this
moment for two months.

Summer. Summer.

1316
01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:04.000
I want dessert, City boy.

1317
01:51:06.339 --> 01:51:10.510
And you for dessert.

1318
01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
I want something sweet.

1319
01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.199
You taste sweet.

1320
01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:28.000
I want chocolate and whipped cream.

01:51:42.300 --> 01:51:46.300

01:51:50.500 --> 01:51:55.610
I think Cocky wants to go out.

1323
01:51:56.610 --> 01:51:59.000
Chocolate?

1324
01:52:01.320 --> 01:52:02.590
You're incredible, Summer.

1325
01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:10.320
Scott just got scared of your beauty.
Your strength.

1326
01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:14.000
And that incredible fucking mouth of yours.

1327
01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:27.320
I think he felt insecure so he choses
a woman that he felt superior to.

I just won't ever cheated on you.

Cole, I see you.

01:52:54.160 --> 01:52:59.000
My God, you put up a lot of layers
of assholes just to keep people out.

But I see the real you.

1332
01:53:04.900 --> 01:53:28.300
It's not an asshole. It's me.

01:53:16.900 --> 01:53:19.300
Perfect.

01:53:22.500 --> 01:53:27.300
I love this you.

01:53:39.990 --> 01:53:41.690
I think I'm addicted.

your system the moment you open your door.

1350
01:55:57.750 --> 01:55:59.370
But what you don't know is that she's mine.

1351
01:55:59.370 --> 01:56:01.230
And if you fuck with her you fuck with me.

1352
01:56:01.230 --> 01:56:05.250
And if I'm ever so lucky, ask

1353
01:56:05.250 --> 01:56:08.180
her to marry me, everyone here is invited.

1354
01:56:08.180 --> 01:56:14.530
We'll be serving crème brulee
so make sure you eat up.

1355
01:56:15.530 --> 01:56:19.489
A joke, babe.

1356
01:56:19.489 --> 01:56:28.820
Except for the marriage part
because I love you.

1357
01:56:31.820 --> 01:56:33.750
Well, look at all these visitors.

1358
01:56:33.750 --> 01:56:35.850
Y'all hungry for some tea and biscuits?

1359
01:56:35.850 --> 01:56:39.530
Cuz Imma bring some out lickety-split.

1360
01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:04.440
And you're in this huge movie now.
You're just-

1361
01:57:04.440 --> 01:57:06.330
Everything seems so-  Good luck.

1362
01:57:06.330 --> 01:57:22.670
I'll see you at the Oscar this year.
For sure.
- Thank you.

1363
01:57:08.310 --> 01:57:18.270
Thank you so much. I love you.
It's Hollywood.

1364
01:57:18.300 --> 01:57:26.270
They're great. They're great.

1365
01:57:26.270 --> 01:57:29.849
Did you hear The Fortune Bottle is up

1366
01:57:29.849 --> 01:57:31.530
for several awards including Best Picture?

1367
01:57:31.900 --> 01:57:34.300
Summer made that movie what it is.

1368
01:57:34.300 --> 01:57:37.349
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh I ran into Shelly and she said

1369
01:57:37.349 --> 01:57:39.300
she think Scott and Bobbie Jo are

1370
01:57:39.300 --> 01:57:40.280
getting a divorce.

1371
01:57:40.280 --> 01:57:42.809
I wouldn't be surprised if he

1372
01:57:42.809 --> 01:57:44.579
cheated on her just like he did to our

1373
01:57:44.579 --> 01:57:47.540
poor Summer.
