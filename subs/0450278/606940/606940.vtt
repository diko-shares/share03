00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.031
- Amsterdam, motherfucker.
- Okay.

2
00:02:23.202 --> 00:02:24.972
Come on, let's go.
Where are we going?

3
00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:27.144
Red-light district. Time for sneepur.

4
00:02:27.323 --> 00:02:29.927
Let's go to the coffee shop first,
then get some sneepur.

5
00:02:30.103 --> 00:02:32.376
Hey, I think the Anne Frank
house is around here.

6
00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:37.333
Did we come to Europe
just to smoke pot?

7
00:02:37.506 --> 00:02:39.036
I came all the way from Iceland.

8
00:02:39.214 --> 00:02:41.819
- Yeah, what if we did?
- We did that every day in college.

9
00:02:41.994 --> 00:02:44.164
Why not, like, you know,
check out a museum?

10
00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:46.315
No, you're right.
We should go to a museum.

11
00:02:46.483 --> 00:02:47.750
How about the hemp museum?

12
00:02:52.211 --> 00:02:53.947
Oli proudly presents...

13
00:02:55.963 --> 00:02:57.630
...Isabella.

14
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.077
She's cute.

15
00:03:00.251 --> 00:03:03.631
But we can't rail a girl
who's in a coma.

16
00:03:03.801 --> 00:03:06.074
I think that's illegal
even in Amsterdam.

17
00:03:06.247 --> 00:03:09.159
- Hey, I'm just warming up, man.
- Fucking Oli.

18
00:03:09.328 --> 00:03:11.463
The Icelandic...
Oh, God, how are you?

19
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.455
You want to get stoned?

20
00:03:15.994 --> 00:03:18.495
- This will wake you up.
- What the fuck?

21
00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:25.265
This is good Amsterdam shit.

22
00:03:28.456 --> 00:03:30.865
That's the shit right there, dude.

23
00:03:31.303 --> 00:03:32.741
Trust me.

24
00:03:37.097 --> 00:03:38.867
Yeah.

25
00:03:39.041 --> 00:03:41.017
- It's all good, bro.
- Yeah, dude, smoke it!

26
00:03:43.161 --> 00:03:45.605
- Dude, what happened?
- Any Dutch people in Amsterdam?

27
00:04:01.886 --> 00:04:03.485
All right, this is my friend, Josh.

28
00:04:03.661 --> 00:04:05.934
- Well, hello.
- Hi.

29
00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:10.992
- Do you guys want another round?
- Yes, okay.

30
00:04:11.165 --> 00:04:12.637
Yeah?

31
00:04:16.524 --> 00:04:18.763
We will be right back.

32
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.348
- What are you doing?
- What?

33
00:04:23.525 --> 00:04:27.705
Do you see a single other person
in here with a fucking fanny pack?

34
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:28.908
Wait. There's a guy.

35
00:04:29.086 --> 00:04:31.427
Why don't you go have
fanny-pack sex with him...

36
00:04:31.598 --> 00:04:34.168
...and jizz all over each other's
storage compartments?

37
00:04:34.345 --> 00:04:37.349
I can't put my passport in my pocket.
It chafes my thighs, bitch.

38
00:04:37.528 --> 00:04:39.263
- All right?
- Yeah.

39
00:04:39.437 --> 00:04:40.602
Where's Oli?

40
00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:46.735
He's fucking genius.

41
00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:53.364
Sneepur alert, 3 o'clock.

42
00:04:53.975 --> 00:04:55.779
- She smokes.
- Dude, it's Europe!

43
00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.331
Every fucking chick smokes.
Stop being a pussy.

44
00:04:59.501 --> 00:05:02.482
You are so easy sometimes.

45
00:05:02.851 --> 00:05:07.066
The power of the pack is yours.
I'm out of here.

46
00:05:14.676 --> 00:05:16.171
I'm sorry.

47
00:05:16.351 --> 00:05:18.590
Yeah, I...
No, I don't even speak Dutch.

48
00:05:18.763 --> 00:05:20.864
No, I'm sorry, I...

49
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.781
Get off me, you fucking
faggot-ass elf. Fuck off.

50
00:05:23.955 --> 00:05:25.553
- Hey, what the fuck?
- Hey. Hey.

51
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:27.500
Come on, faggot.

52
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.526
- Fucker!
- Get your fucking hands off me.

53
00:05:33.703 --> 00:05:36.238
- I'm an American, I got rights.
- Get the fuck out.

54
00:05:36.416 --> 00:05:39.727
- Your fucking club sucks ass, bro.
- Kiss my American ass, fucker.

55
00:05:39.899 --> 00:05:41.737
- Fuck you.
- Let's get out of here, bro.

56
00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:43.885
Hey, I don't know why
you guys are waiting.

57
00:05:44.053 --> 00:05:47.229
It's a fucking fag fest in there.
Wall-to-wall fucking cock.

58
00:05:47.403 --> 00:05:49.813
You need one of these
to get in, bro. Sorry.

59
00:05:49.983 --> 00:05:51.478
That shit was classic, dude.

60
00:05:51.657 --> 00:05:54.661
He was gonna throw down
with a 400-pound Dutchman.

61
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.215
I'm fucking awesome!

62
00:05:57.988 --> 00:05:59.221
I don't fucking know what...

63
00:05:59.395 --> 00:06:02.239
I thought you were a Jew, man.
This guy's a fucking Israeli!

64
00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:03.974
You are fucking Israeli.

65
00:06:05.022 --> 00:06:07.901
Oh, God, I hope bestiality
is legal in Amsterdam...

66
00:06:08.071 --> 00:06:11.109
...because that girl's a fucking hog.
Look at that, man.

67
00:06:11.522 --> 00:06:13.623
Hey, guys,
I think she likes me, man.

68
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.112
Oh, look at that.
Josh, my gift to you, man.

69
00:06:17.283 --> 00:06:21.098
Thanks, but paying to do whatever
you want to someone isn't a turn-on.

70
00:06:21.269 --> 00:06:24.649
How are you gonna get over your chick
if you don't bang some new pussy?

71
00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.092
You can't go home
without getting some hot chick.

72
00:06:27.265 --> 00:06:29.298
I agree, but I shouldn't
have to pay for it.

73
00:06:29.476 --> 00:06:31.543
Hey, come on, I'm paying, man.

74
00:06:57.513 --> 00:06:59.077
Hey.

75
00:06:59.824 --> 00:07:01.560
Are you okay?

76
00:07:02.773 --> 00:07:05.548
Hello? Hello?

77
00:07:10.712 --> 00:07:13.750
Hey, close the door.
You watch, you pay.

78
00:07:13.927 --> 00:07:15.629
Sorry. Jesus.

79
00:07:16.205 --> 00:07:17.975
You're up, slugger.

80
00:07:18.784 --> 00:07:22.462
Man, I'm fucking... I'm tired, man.
I can, like, barely stand up.

81
00:07:22.636 --> 00:07:24.635
Josh, you want
to be a fucking writer?

82
00:07:24.814 --> 00:07:27.589
How about some life experience,
right there in that room.

83
00:07:30.408 --> 00:07:32.749
- What do we have in here?
- Hey, you watch, you pay.

84
00:07:32.921 --> 00:07:35.364
I pay. I pay, man. Come on.

85
00:07:44.008 --> 00:07:45.001
Hey.

86
00:07:46.185 --> 00:07:48.321
Come, sit.

87
00:07:51.847 --> 00:07:54.587
Your friends are so funny.

88
00:07:55.297 --> 00:07:57.135
Yeah.

89
00:07:58.077 --> 00:08:01.686
You can wash over here, by sink.

90
00:08:16.668 --> 00:08:18.232
It was fine.

91
00:08:18.511 --> 00:08:21.651
What do you mean? That bitch had
the best fucking tits in Amsterdam.

92
00:08:21.827 --> 00:08:24.065
It was fine. It was whatever.

93
00:08:28.828 --> 00:08:30.530
What was that?

94
00:08:30.703 --> 00:08:33.684
- It's fucking after curfew, man.
- Curfew? What are we, 13?

95
00:08:33.853 --> 00:08:37.428
Let us the fuck in,
we're freezing our balls off.

96
00:08:37.604 --> 00:08:40.208
We paid to stay here.
They can't just, like, lock us out.

97
00:08:40.384 --> 00:08:41.651
This is bullshit.

98
00:08:41.825 --> 00:08:43.058
Hello?

99
00:08:43.231 --> 00:08:44.830
Open the fucking door.

100
00:08:49.864 --> 00:08:52.868
- What did you tell him?
- He just told them to let us in.

101
00:08:55.726 --> 00:08:57.827
- Shut up!
- Jesus.

102
00:08:58.004 --> 00:09:00.779
Shut the fuck up,
you fucking Americans.

103
00:09:00.951 --> 00:09:02.790
Hey, I know what to do.

104
00:09:06.948 --> 00:09:08.387
Shut up.

105
00:09:09.728 --> 00:09:12.298
Hey, hey, guys. Up here.
Climb quickly.

106
00:09:12.843 --> 00:09:14.579
Come on.

107
00:09:14.887 --> 00:09:15.915
Go. Go, go, go.

108
00:09:23.629 --> 00:09:25.125
Oh, don't mind them.

109
00:09:25.706 --> 00:09:29.178
They are so fucked up they don't
know what planet they are on.

110
00:09:31.468 --> 00:09:34.072
- Thanks, bro.
- It's no problem.

111
00:09:34.249 --> 00:09:37.252
Not everyone
want to kill Americans.

112
00:09:38.268 --> 00:09:39.866
Paxton.

113
00:09:42.991 --> 00:09:45.264
Alexei. But call me Alex.

114
00:09:45.436 --> 00:09:50.050
What's up, Alex.
This is Josh and Oli.

115
00:09:50.495 --> 00:09:52.265
Guys, this is fucking awesome, man.

116
00:09:52.438 --> 00:09:55.008
I'm the first in line for sneepur.

117
00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:59.095
Oh, that's Icelandic for "clit."

118
00:10:00.544 --> 00:10:03.423
Clitoris or clitoris,
however you wanna say that.

119
00:10:03.592 --> 00:10:04.654
Women have it.

120
00:10:04.831 --> 00:10:08.874
It's, like, right near the labia.
Like, it hangs.

121
00:10:09.053 --> 00:10:12.262
Oh, yeah.
Very good sneepur in Iceland.

122
00:10:12.436 --> 00:10:14.845
- Yeah.
- Come on, guys, have a seat.

123
00:10:22.719 --> 00:10:24.158
Where you travel to?

124
00:10:24.327 --> 00:10:27.503
We started in Paris,
which is where we met this drifter.

125
00:10:27.677 --> 00:10:29.275
Anyway, we went all over France...

126
00:10:29.452 --> 00:10:32.399
...and then Switzerland, Belgium,
and now we're in Amsterdam.

127
00:10:32.567 --> 00:10:35.068
Yeah, kind of over Amsterdam.
Way too many Americans.

128
00:10:35.247 --> 00:10:38.285
Yeah, but Oli's got a friend
with a flat in Barcelona...

129
00:10:38.463 --> 00:10:41.673
...and he's supposed to hook us up
with some hot-ass seÃ±oritas.

130
00:10:42.181 --> 00:10:43.814
Looking for girls?

131
00:10:45.933 --> 00:10:47.165
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

132
00:10:48.411 --> 00:10:50.787
So talk to Alex.

133
00:10:51.259 --> 00:10:54.868
He open up the pussy
all over the Europe.

134
00:10:55.044 --> 00:10:56.209
I can help you.

135
00:10:56.753 --> 00:11:00.133
Oh, shit.
Alex is a pimp, apparently.

136
00:11:00.906 --> 00:11:03.441
Thanks, bro,
but I think we'll be okay.

137
00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.092
- Yeah.
- Good.

138
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:12.892
You looking for girls like this?

139
00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:25.191
These are fucking magnificent.

140
00:11:26.331 --> 00:11:29.244
- Who the hell are these girls?
- You have to go east, my friend.

141
00:11:29.412 --> 00:11:31.479
This is where the best girls are.

142
00:11:31.657 --> 00:11:32.993
The best.

143
00:11:33.164 --> 00:11:35.002
How far east?

144
00:11:35.174 --> 00:11:38.120
You can go as far as Ukraine,
around Odessa.

145
00:11:39.127 --> 00:11:42.268
These girls I met
at this one hostel in Slovakia...

146
00:11:42.443 --> 00:11:44.042
...just outside Bratislava.

147
00:11:44.621 --> 00:11:47.659
The girls there are so hot
you cannot believe it.

148
00:11:48.573 --> 00:11:51.486
And they love anyone foreign,
especially American.

149
00:11:51.889 --> 00:11:54.264
They hear your accent,
they fuck you.

150
00:11:54.435 --> 00:11:57.611
So wait, this place
is near Bratislava?

151
00:11:57.785 --> 00:11:58.882
Josh.

152
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.867
You won't find this hostel
in any guidebook.

153
00:12:02.609 --> 00:12:06.218
Barcelona, so many Americans.

154
00:12:06.394 --> 00:12:08.529
But Slovakia? No one there.

155
00:12:08.705 --> 00:12:12.622
There is so much pussy, and because
of the war, there are no guys.

156
00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:16.098
You go to this hostel,
you will have any girl you want.

157
00:12:16.275 --> 00:12:18.880
They go crazy for any foreigner.

158
00:12:19.056 --> 00:12:20.826
You just...

159
00:12:22.239 --> 00:12:23.975
...take them.

160
00:12:52.084 --> 00:12:53.888
Fuck, man.

161
00:12:56.741 --> 00:12:59.950
Can't you keep your Viking ass
in your pants for, like, two seconds?

162
00:13:00.124 --> 00:13:01.928
Hey, man, I shaved my ass
just for you.

163
00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.168
- Okay, all right.
- My Viking balls too.

164
00:13:04.344 --> 00:13:05.783
Okay, stop.

165
00:13:17.777 --> 00:13:19.307
I'm sorry.

166
00:13:19.485 --> 00:13:21.015
My daughter.

167
00:13:21.194 --> 00:13:23.193
She miss her daddy,
and Daddy miss her.

168
00:13:23.372 --> 00:13:24.970
Yeah, no problem, dude, it's cool.

169
00:13:28.765 --> 00:13:30.866
- Saskia.
- Cute.

170
00:13:31.377 --> 00:13:35.020
- She's adorable.
- She's a little cutie, yeah.

171
00:13:36.804 --> 00:13:39.282
This is Svanhildur, my daughter.

172
00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:41.014
- Very pretty.
- She's 6.

173
00:13:41.661 --> 00:13:43.225
She's starting school this year.

174
00:13:43.939 --> 00:13:45.846
Wait, you have a daughter?

175
00:13:46.016 --> 00:13:48.860
Yeah, of course, my horse.
I was married for eight years.

176
00:13:50.337 --> 00:13:52.644
Okay. All right.

177
00:13:52.816 --> 00:13:55.590
- You are on vacation?
- Yeah, we're backpacking.

178
00:13:55.763 --> 00:13:57.236
Our next stop is Bratislava.

179
00:13:59.984 --> 00:14:02.896
- What?
- Slovakia.

180
00:14:04.741 --> 00:14:06.717
You will like it.

181
00:14:06.985 --> 00:14:09.326
Casino, girls.

182
00:14:11.508 --> 00:14:14.545
You can pay to do anything.

183
00:14:14.723 --> 00:14:16.493
Anything.

184
00:14:17.537 --> 00:14:20.541
- How are the girls?
- Very beautiful.

185
00:14:21.154 --> 00:14:24.067
They will love you.
Handsome American like you.

186
00:14:26.246 --> 00:14:29.752
Handsome devil. He is handsome.

187
00:14:30.634 --> 00:14:33.810
That's... That's awkward.
That's awkward.

188
00:14:42.258 --> 00:14:44.393
That's awkward too.

189
00:14:46.177 --> 00:14:49.249
- You need a fork there, chief?
- No, no, no.

190
00:14:49.427 --> 00:14:51.962
I prefer to use my hands.

191
00:14:52.843 --> 00:14:54.545
I believe...

192
00:14:54.853 --> 00:14:58.702
...people have
lost their relationship with food.

193
00:15:00.078 --> 00:15:01.449
They do not think:

194
00:15:01.619 --> 00:15:05.297
"This is something who gave its life
so I would not go hungry."

195
00:15:06.042 --> 00:15:09.388
I like to have a connection
with something that died for me.

196
00:15:09.558 --> 00:15:10.963
I appreciate it more.

197
00:15:12.172 --> 00:15:13.610
Well, I'm vegetarian.

198
00:15:13.779 --> 00:15:16.256
And I am a meat-eater.

199
00:15:16.425 --> 00:15:18.367
It's human nature.

200
00:15:19.306 --> 00:15:21.510
Well, I'm human,
and it's not in my nature.

201
00:15:22.489 --> 00:15:25.230
Tell me, what is your nature?

202
00:15:26.073 --> 00:15:28.516
Don't touch!
Don't fucking touch me!

203
00:15:28.987 --> 00:15:30.585
I'm sorry.

204
00:15:32.035 --> 00:15:33.474
Excuse me.

205
00:15:35.117 --> 00:15:36.556
Fucking freak.

206
00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:39.462
Jesus.

207
00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:46.134
Edward Saladhands
just groped Josh.

208
00:15:47.745 --> 00:15:50.053
Dude, you finally hooked up.
That's awesome.

209
00:15:50.359 --> 00:15:52.666
Yeah, that's fucking hilarious.

210
00:16:58.090 --> 00:16:59.792
Or we could visit some factories.

211
00:17:01.205 --> 00:17:02.610
Should be cool.

212
00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:04.618
In this area...

213
00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:09.335
...we make plastic for Slovakia.

214
00:17:11.422 --> 00:17:12.655
Is that so?

215
00:17:35.172 --> 00:17:36.908
Look at this.

216
00:18:20.762 --> 00:18:24.074
- Nice, eh?
- This is a fucking hostel?

217
00:18:25.218 --> 00:18:27.490
Holy shit.

218
00:18:33.625 --> 00:18:36.572
You can have that, man.
I'm too scared.

219
00:18:40.726 --> 00:18:42.598
Hey, hey. The party has arrived.

220
00:18:43.943 --> 00:18:46.513
- You are saved from boredom.
- Let me guess.

221
00:18:46.689 --> 00:18:50.139
You must be
the King of the Swing.

222
00:18:50.307 --> 00:18:52.545
You made a reservation under
"King of the Swing?"

223
00:18:52.719 --> 00:18:54.489
- Yeah, of course, my horse.
- I'm sorry.

224
00:18:54.662 --> 00:18:58.545
- He doesn't get out of his cage much.
- I can see that.

225
00:19:01.227 --> 00:19:03.031
Here are your keys.

226
00:19:03.304 --> 00:19:06.148
You leave your passports
at the desk.

227
00:19:10.037 --> 00:19:13.109
That was taken when I was like 13.
I was kind of husky.

228
00:19:13.286 --> 00:19:14.657
Not anymore, though, you know?

229
00:19:14.827 --> 00:19:17.808
Do you have any private rooms?
We're probably gonna need them.

230
00:19:17.976 --> 00:19:22.156
The rooms are semiprivate,
so you will have roommates.

231
00:19:22.331 --> 00:19:25.243
Roommates, huh? That's gay.

232
00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:34.689
Sorry.

233
00:19:35.127 --> 00:19:38.267
- Oh, my God.
- It's okay.

234
00:19:38.443 --> 00:19:41.389
The room is yours.
We are going to the spa.

235
00:19:43.903 --> 00:19:45.741
You should come.

236
00:19:49.597 --> 00:19:51.367
Spa.

237
00:20:06.347 --> 00:20:08.219
Jugs.

238
00:20:11.907 --> 00:20:14.283
- Hey.
- Hello.

239
00:20:14.452 --> 00:20:16.451
Oh, Jesus.

240
00:20:18.506 --> 00:20:20.573
- Hi. Hey.
- Hi.

241
00:20:23.664 --> 00:20:25.606
How you doing?

242
00:20:28.656 --> 00:20:31.465
I'm so happy I shaved my balls.

243
00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:36.755
What? I have the smoothest balls
in Iceland.

244
00:20:36.929 --> 00:20:40.001
- You wanna see?
- No, no, no, you're not... I'm good.

245
00:20:40.179 --> 00:20:42.452
Put your anteater away,
it's totally creepy.

246
00:20:43.964 --> 00:20:46.876
- You're not from Iceland, no?
- No. Fuck, no. American.

247
00:20:47.046 --> 00:20:49.752
Yeah, unlike him,
I had my foreskin removed at birth.

248
00:20:50.328 --> 00:20:52.567
Hygiene and... Am I talking?

249
00:20:52.975 --> 00:20:55.510
- I'm Josh.
- Natalya.

250
00:20:55.822 --> 00:20:57.957
- And this is Svetlana.
- Hi.

251
00:20:58.603 --> 00:21:00.304
Hi, I'm Paxton.

252
00:21:00.813 --> 00:21:03.486
- And this is Oli.
- The King of the Swing.

253
00:21:03.962 --> 00:21:06.269
Hello.

254
00:21:07.613 --> 00:21:09.782
Face on the ass. Never gets old.

255
00:21:09.958 --> 00:21:11.431
Jesus.

256
00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.541
So where are you girls from?

257
00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:15.983
I'm from Italy,
but my parents are Russian.

258
00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:18.225
Prague.

259
00:21:19.203 --> 00:21:22.207
Prague's cool. Kafka.

260
00:21:22.721 --> 00:21:25.861
So, Natalya...

261
00:21:26.037 --> 00:21:28.675
- Yeah?
- You're Russian, eh?

262
00:21:50.289 --> 00:21:53.966
Oh, my God.
Look, there are too many girls.

263
00:21:57.357 --> 00:21:59.996
- This is awesome.
- Yes.

264
00:22:41.373 --> 00:22:43.851
I mean, I was a senior,
you know, she was a junior...

265
00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:46.429
...and then I graduated,
and it was weird, you know.

266
00:22:46.599 --> 00:22:50.985
I mean, I'm totally over it.
It's... You know, it's cool.

267
00:22:51.154 --> 00:22:52.593
It's okay.

268
00:22:52.762 --> 00:22:54.292
Look, Vala is here.

269
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:57.976
- Who?
- Vala, from front desk. Vala.

270
00:22:59.294 --> 00:23:02.069
- All right, Oli.
- Hey, I told you, man.

271
00:23:02.242 --> 00:23:04.343
I'm the King of the Swing.

272
00:23:04.888 --> 00:23:07.869
Come, let's dance.

273
00:23:15.809 --> 00:23:18.653
- Does the cigarette bother you?
- No, it's...

274
00:23:18.823 --> 00:23:20.593
I put away.

275
00:23:20.766 --> 00:23:23.039
It's fine, I...

276
00:23:23.212 --> 00:23:26.124
I'm gonna go get some fresh air.

277
00:23:26.393 --> 00:23:29.305
But I'll be back, okay?

278
00:23:51.684 --> 00:23:52.917
Cigarette.

279
00:23:54.029 --> 00:23:55.502
Cigarette.

280
00:23:56.039 --> 00:23:57.238
Aren't you a little young?

281
00:23:57.412 --> 00:23:59.216
- Dollar.
- What?

282
00:23:59.858 --> 00:24:01.125
Dollar.

283
00:24:06.557 --> 00:24:08.761
- Dollar.
- Here you go.

284
00:24:16.606 --> 00:24:18.548
Here, children commit
the most crime.

285
00:24:18.984 --> 00:24:22.125
They don't care.
They will attack anyone.

286
00:24:22.703 --> 00:24:25.341
- You're okay?
- Yeah, yeah. Thank you.

287
00:24:27.795 --> 00:24:29.828
Hey, let me buy you a drink.

288
00:24:30.106 --> 00:24:31.545
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

289
00:24:33.154 --> 00:24:35.095
Hey, Josh.

290
00:24:35.264 --> 00:24:36.737
Faggot.

291
00:24:37.073 --> 00:24:39.551
Go with your friends. It's okay.

292
00:24:39.719 --> 00:24:41.558
I wanted to say sorry about earlier.

293
00:24:41.729 --> 00:24:43.762
About the way I reacted.

294
00:24:44.275 --> 00:24:45.943
We cool?

295
00:24:50.774 --> 00:24:54.017
I would have done
the same thing at your age.

296
00:24:56.234 --> 00:24:58.301
It's not easy...

297
00:24:58.913 --> 00:25:01.152
...but from my experience...

298
00:25:01.326 --> 00:25:04.672
...choosing to have a family
was the right choice for me.

299
00:25:07.053 --> 00:25:08.389
Now I have my little girl...

300
00:25:08.561 --> 00:25:12.342
...who means more to me
than anything in the world.

301
00:25:13.183 --> 00:25:16.187
But you should do...

302
00:25:16.366 --> 00:25:18.741
...whatever's right for you.

303
00:25:20.921 --> 00:25:23.993
Excuse me, it's my turn now.

304
00:25:39.814 --> 00:25:41.652
Should we be doing this
with them there?

305
00:25:41.824 --> 00:25:43.628
Yeah, it's okay.

306
00:25:45.207 --> 00:25:49.388
- Yeah, baby. Josh, give it to me, baby.
- Okay, all right. Okay, stop!

307
00:25:49.562 --> 00:25:52.040
- All right.
- Come on, big boy.

308
00:25:52.209 --> 00:25:54.618
- We go to spa.
- Spa.

309
00:25:54.788 --> 00:25:57.460
Spa, spa, spa.
Being dirty while getting clean.

310
00:25:57.635 --> 00:25:59.199
Bye.

311
00:27:25.264 --> 00:27:27.034
Mission accomplished.

312
00:27:30.289 --> 00:27:34.172
You know that Amsterdam kid
with the thing on his lip?

313
00:27:34.342 --> 00:27:37.082
I'm gonna send him
a really nice thank-you note.

314
00:27:37.792 --> 00:27:39.390
Be quiet.

315
00:27:43.252 --> 00:27:45.525
They're showering together.

316
00:27:48.512 --> 00:27:50.819
Shit, man. We're never leaving here.

317
00:27:52.732 --> 00:27:54.605
I guess Oli's not back yet.

318
00:27:54.775 --> 00:27:57.550
No, dude, he probably
took that desk girl home.

319
00:27:57.723 --> 00:27:59.253
We'll see him at breakfast.

320
00:28:13.132 --> 00:28:17.347
- What's the name?
- Oli Ericson, 237.

321
00:28:20.301 --> 00:28:22.905
How are we supposed to
understand this without subtitles?

322
00:28:23.081 --> 00:28:24.211
Fucking gay.

323
00:28:24.387 --> 00:28:26.420
Yeah, he checked out this morning.

324
00:28:27.101 --> 00:28:29.008
You mean he took his
passport to go out?

325
00:28:29.178 --> 00:28:31.553
No, it say he checked out
this morning.

326
00:28:32.494 --> 00:28:34.732
- When this morning?
- I don't know exact time.

327
00:28:34.905 --> 00:28:37.075
I could find out tomorrow.

328
00:28:43.414 --> 00:28:46.327
Hey, Oli, it's Pax.
Are you still with that chick?

329
00:28:46.495 --> 00:28:48.437
Can I leave a note
in case he comes back?

330
00:28:48.606 --> 00:28:50.639
Okay, cool. Yeah.

331
00:28:53.898 --> 00:28:55.462
All right.

332
00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:03.038
He's probably still with Vala.
When she call me, I call you, okay?

333
00:29:03.211 --> 00:29:05.015
Okay.

334
00:29:05.187 --> 00:29:06.752
- We see you later, right?
- Yeah.

335
00:29:07.431 --> 00:29:09.029
Okay.

336
00:29:10.112 --> 00:29:11.344
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

337
00:29:11.518 --> 00:29:16.200
Oli, hey, it's me again.
We're gonna go into town, so call us.

338
00:29:16.375 --> 00:29:18.043
You're gay.
Damn voice mail again.

339
00:29:18.218 --> 00:29:21.428
- Hi! Hi! Hi!
- Hi.

340
00:29:21.602 --> 00:29:23.303
Your friend.

341
00:29:24.582 --> 00:29:27.654
- What the hell?
- Your friend, my friend.

342
00:29:27.832 --> 00:29:29.704
What does that say?

343
00:29:30.746 --> 00:29:32.414
Sayonara. Your friend.

344
00:29:32.588 --> 00:29:34.222
What, they left? Like, together?

345
00:29:34.398 --> 00:29:37.310
That doesn't make any sense.
Oli doesn't even like Asian girls.

346
00:29:37.479 --> 00:29:39.077
I mean, no offense, but...

347
00:29:39.255 --> 00:29:40.784
When did she send this to you?

348
00:29:40.962 --> 00:29:43.098
This picture. Today?

349
00:29:43.643 --> 00:29:46.589
Could you do me a favor
and send this picture to my phone?

350
00:29:46.758 --> 00:29:47.751
This picture.

351
00:29:50.141 --> 00:29:51.511
That water looks fucking cold.

352
00:29:51.682 --> 00:29:54.217
You know, if you fell in,
you'd die in 90 seconds.

353
00:29:54.396 --> 00:29:56.839
Dude, did I tell you I saw
a girl drown when I was 8?

354
00:29:57.511 --> 00:29:59.818
- Where?
- Lake Michigan.

355
00:29:59.989 --> 00:30:04.946
It was fucked up, man.
This little girl, probably 4 or 5.

356
00:30:05.315 --> 00:30:08.787
We made eye contact,
which was a weird thing, you know...

357
00:30:08.967 --> 00:30:11.571
...and she was yelling for me
to help her.

358
00:30:11.746 --> 00:30:13.117
Yeah? What did you do?

359
00:30:13.287 --> 00:30:17.136
I ran to the lifeguard, who was busy
talking to her boyfriend at the time...

360
00:30:17.307 --> 00:30:19.877
...and I yelled, you know,
"There's this girl drowning."

361
00:30:20.054 --> 00:30:22.932
And she couldn't see her.
Probably thought I was making it up.

362
00:30:23.103 --> 00:30:27.146
And then a second later all you could
hear was this horrible screaming.

363
00:30:27.624 --> 00:30:29.931
It was that little girl's mother, dude.

364
00:30:30.639 --> 00:30:32.044
Her kid was dead.

365
00:30:32.516 --> 00:30:35.290
- Jesus.
- I had nightmares for years after that.

366
00:30:35.463 --> 00:30:39.209
I mean, I'd wake up every fucking
night hearing that mother scream.

367
00:30:39.382 --> 00:30:40.981
I just...

368
00:30:41.157 --> 00:30:42.961
I just felt like I could have
done more.

369
00:30:43.134 --> 00:30:45.738
You did the right thing.
Could've been a double drowning.

370
00:30:45.914 --> 00:30:48.153
Yeah, well, I didn't see it
that way at the time.

371
00:30:48.326 --> 00:30:51.970
All I knew was this little girl was dead
and her mother's life was ruined.

372
00:30:52.145 --> 00:30:54.315
What makes you think of this now?

373
00:30:58.509 --> 00:30:59.571
Bubble gum.

374
00:31:00.787 --> 00:31:03.528
- Sorry, kid.
- No, no. Give him some.

375
00:31:07.219 --> 00:31:09.057
What are you doing?

376
00:31:10.167 --> 00:31:12.737
These fucking kids are dangerous.

377
00:31:13.517 --> 00:31:14.989
Hey, Oli.

378
00:31:15.158 --> 00:31:17.362
- Hey, Oli.
- Hey.

379
00:31:20.015 --> 00:31:21.923
- Hey.
- Hey.

380
00:31:22.091 --> 00:31:25.403
- Hey, Oli. Hey!
- Oli!

381
00:31:30.433 --> 00:31:32.237
It's your lucky day, Josh.

382
00:31:32.409 --> 00:31:34.042
A museum.

383
00:32:20.008 --> 00:32:21.345
How's it hanging?

384
00:32:23.493 --> 00:32:26.268
- What the fuck?
- Holy shit.

385
00:32:26.441 --> 00:32:28.416
- He got you.
- Yeah, that's hilarious.

386
00:32:28.584 --> 00:32:29.817
Okay.

387
00:32:30.528 --> 00:32:32.092
Hey, Oli.

388
00:32:33.809 --> 00:32:35.511
Hey, Oli.

389
00:32:35.686 --> 00:32:36.988
Hey, hey.

390
00:32:38.901 --> 00:32:40.203
Excuse me?

391
00:32:41.011 --> 00:32:44.152
I'm sorry, I thought you
were someone else.

392
00:32:44.328 --> 00:32:46.967
Well, I'm not.

393
00:32:47.141 --> 00:32:48.740
Where did you get that jacket?

394
00:32:51.161 --> 00:32:54.702
- Hey, I'm talking to you, man.
- Get your fucking hands off me.

395
00:32:55.952 --> 00:32:59.024
This is my jacket.

396
00:33:15.179 --> 00:33:16.846
It's from Oli.

397
00:33:18.328 --> 00:33:19.321
"I go home"?

398
00:34:18.288 --> 00:34:20.893
I don't know,
maybe his battery died.

399
00:34:22.107 --> 00:34:24.551
Hey, Kana, when are you leaving?

400
00:34:25.859 --> 00:34:29.171
I'm sorry. When are you going away?

401
00:34:29.778 --> 00:34:31.914
Tomorrow, I go.

402
00:34:32.089 --> 00:34:33.460
Okay, because we may go too.

403
00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:37.445
Do you wanna go to the train with us?
To the train station?

404
00:34:39.191 --> 00:34:41.167
Tomorrow, train?

405
00:34:41.334 --> 00:34:43.002
Yeah, yeah.

406
00:34:45.757 --> 00:34:47.664
- Hello, Josh.
- Hey.

407
00:34:47.834 --> 00:34:49.775
- Hey.
- Come, we go for disco?

408
00:34:49.944 --> 00:34:53.656
Actually, I just wanna find my friend
and get the fuck out of here.

409
00:34:56.074 --> 00:34:58.815
Okay, we'll see you.

410
00:35:04.615 --> 00:35:08.327
Hey, guys, hold up a sec.
We'll be right out.

411
00:35:08.502 --> 00:35:10.135
Okay.

412
00:35:12.588 --> 00:35:15.122
- Josh, come here, dude.
- Yeah, what?

413
00:35:15.636 --> 00:35:18.880
It's not their fault Oli disappeared,
so stop acting like it is.

414
00:35:19.053 --> 00:35:21.188
- I'm annoyed he'd ditch us.
- I'm pissed too.

415
00:35:21.365 --> 00:35:22.861
But we're not in America.

416
00:35:23.039 --> 00:35:25.986
I mean, people meet each other
and split without saying shit.

417
00:35:26.456 --> 00:35:28.089
It's just how they do it over here.

418
00:35:28.265 --> 00:35:31.177
As well as we may think we know Oli,
we don't really know him.

419
00:35:31.347 --> 00:35:33.254
He could've gone
somewhere with that girl.

420
00:35:33.424 --> 00:35:36.462
Fuck, maybe he's in Iceland.
The guy's got a daughter.

421
00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:37.976
So let's look at our options.

422
00:35:38.146 --> 00:35:41.424
We can A, fuck these girls one more
night and then head to Barcelona...

423
00:35:41.597 --> 00:35:44.943
...or B, not fuck them,
then head to Barcelona anyway.

424
00:35:45.115 --> 00:35:48.930
Think about it. When I'm studying for
the bar and you're writing your thesis...

425
00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:51.201
...this is the shit
we're gonna think about.

426
00:35:51.378 --> 00:35:54.450
Okay. All right, he doesn't show up,
it's his problem.

427
00:35:54.628 --> 00:35:56.969
- It's his problem.
- All right.

428
00:35:57.140 --> 00:35:59.275
All right.

429
00:35:59.451 --> 00:36:02.763
Hey, Kana, you wanna go
to the disco with us?

430
00:36:03.169 --> 00:36:04.699
You know, disco?
Dancing?

431
00:36:05.782 --> 00:36:07.221
No?

432
00:36:48.324 --> 00:36:50.425
Josh?

433
00:36:50.601 --> 00:36:53.376
- I'm gonna go back.
- Are you okay?

434
00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:54.886
I'm, like... I'm tired.

435
00:36:55.057 --> 00:36:57.627
Actually, I have, like, a headache.

436
00:36:58.474 --> 00:37:00.575
If you want, I will go with you.

437
00:37:01.187 --> 00:37:05.264
No, no, no, I'll just see you
back at the room.

438
00:37:07.317 --> 00:37:09.452
Goodbye.

439
00:37:14.519 --> 00:37:15.615
Fucking pussy.

440
00:37:48.251 --> 00:37:49.781
- Josh.
- Vala.

441
00:37:49.959 --> 00:37:51.797
You don't look well.

442
00:37:51.969 --> 00:37:54.208
- No, I...
- Here, let me help you.

443
00:37:54.381 --> 00:37:57.453
I feel sick.

444
00:38:08.015 --> 00:38:10.893
Where is?
Where is Oli?

445
00:38:11.063 --> 00:38:13.096
You need rest.

446
00:38:40.809 --> 00:38:42.910
Where's the restroom?

447
00:38:43.556 --> 00:38:45.999
Past the bar, in the back.

448
00:38:53.036 --> 00:38:54.098
You guys cool?

449
00:38:54.844 --> 00:38:57.219
- Vodka Red Bull.
- Vodka Red Bull, danke.

450
00:39:02.113 --> 00:39:03.586
Yeah.

451
00:39:44.722 --> 00:39:46.526
Hey!

452
00:39:47.603 --> 00:39:49.441
Hey!

453
00:40:12.591 --> 00:40:14.464
Open the door.

454
00:40:35.303 --> 00:40:37.175
Oh, fuck.

455
00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:44.335
What the f..?

456
00:41:02.604 --> 00:41:04.476
Oh, fuck.

457
00:41:18.917 --> 00:41:21.555
What? Who are you?

458
00:41:22.099 --> 00:41:23.732
What the f..? Where the fuck am I?

459
00:41:23.908 --> 00:41:26.386
What the fuck is this shit?

460
00:41:27.258 --> 00:41:29.462
Please, please...
Fuck. Please, please, please...

461
00:41:29.636 --> 00:41:31.875
I didn't fucking do shit to you,
what the fuck!

462
00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:35.898
Please, please, what the..?

463
00:41:36.067 --> 00:41:39.517
Please, no, sir.
Please fucking stop. Please!

464
00:41:39.686 --> 00:41:40.850
What the fuck?

465
00:41:41.461 --> 00:41:43.699
Please, I didn't fucking do anything.

466
00:41:44.777 --> 00:41:46.375
What the fuck?

467
00:41:46.552 --> 00:41:50.595
What the fuck?
This is such fucking bullshit.

468
00:41:50.773 --> 00:41:52.269
What the fuck is this?

469
00:41:52.447 --> 00:41:54.286
What? No! No, please don't..!

470
00:41:54.457 --> 00:41:56.593
What the..?
No, no, fucking don't you... No, no!

471
00:41:56.970 --> 00:41:59.448
Oh, my God, no, no!
Oh, my fucking God!

472
00:41:59.616 --> 00:42:01.592
Oh, my God! No, no, no, no!

473
00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:04.033
Oh, please. What the fuck?

474
00:42:04.205 --> 00:42:06.615
No, no, no, no, fuck! No!

475
00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:18.604
Fuck! Oh, fuck!

476
00:42:51.303 --> 00:42:52.536
You.

477
00:42:58.070 --> 00:42:59.840
Why?

478
00:43:03.027 --> 00:43:06.910
I always wanted to be a surgeon...

479
00:43:07.516 --> 00:43:10.325
...but the boards wouldn't pass me.

480
00:43:11.502 --> 00:43:12.804
Can you guess why?

481
00:43:23.595 --> 00:43:25.090
You see?

482
00:43:26.744 --> 00:43:28.983
So I went into business...

483
00:43:29.155 --> 00:43:31.828
...but business is so boring.

484
00:43:32.572 --> 00:43:36.614
You buy things, you sell them.
You make money, you spend money.

485
00:43:36.793 --> 00:43:38.529
What kind of life is that?

486
00:43:39.238 --> 00:43:41.510
A surgeon...

487
00:43:41.683 --> 00:43:45.429
...he holds the very essence
of life in his hands.

488
00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:47.334
Your life.

489
00:43:47.512 --> 00:43:49.990
He touches it.

490
00:43:51.499 --> 00:43:53.999
He has a relationship with it.

491
00:43:54.379 --> 00:43:56.880
He's part of it.

492
00:43:59.504 --> 00:44:02.313
Please, please.
Just let me go, please.

493
00:44:02.485 --> 00:44:05.055
You want to go?

494
00:44:05.567 --> 00:44:08.068
Is that what you want?

495
00:44:27.206 --> 00:44:29.650
Oh, my God!

496
00:44:35.748 --> 00:44:38.192
Fuck! Oh, fuck!

497
00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:50.979
You are free to go.

498
00:45:15.845 --> 00:45:19.351
Oh, fuck. No!

499
00:45:19.529 --> 00:45:22.601
No. No, fuck. No, fuck...

500
00:45:23.649 --> 00:45:26.322
Please, I have money.
I'll fucking pay you.

501
00:45:26.497 --> 00:45:28.369
Ten times, two times,
whatever you want...

502
00:45:28.541 --> 00:45:29.945
- Pay me?
- Yes.

503
00:45:30.115 --> 00:45:31.611
No one is paying me.

504
00:45:31.789 --> 00:45:35.364
In fact, I am the one paying them.

505
00:45:45.993 --> 00:45:48.837
Relax. Relax, bro.

506
00:45:49.276 --> 00:45:50.748
Oh, shit.

507
00:46:06.861 --> 00:46:09.100
- Two thirty-seven, please.
- Two three seven.

508
00:46:09.708 --> 00:46:10.941
Didn't you check out?

509
00:46:12.254 --> 00:46:13.521
No, not yet.

510
00:46:13.930 --> 00:46:15.426
Not yet.

511
00:46:15.604 --> 00:46:19.316
- This your bag?
- Yeah.

512
00:46:19.490 --> 00:46:22.094
The maid brought it here.
You're checked out.

513
00:46:22.404 --> 00:46:24.002
- I didn't check out.
- It says.

514
00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:25.847
It happened this morning.

515
00:46:26.022 --> 00:46:28.157
This is bullshit.
Did somebody leave a note?

516
00:46:28.333 --> 00:46:30.400
Because I didn't
fucking check out, dude.

517
00:46:30.912 --> 00:46:34.156
No, man, just this bag.
If it's a mistake...

518
00:46:34.330 --> 00:46:36.900
Yeah, it's definitely a mistake.
We need a fucking room.

519
00:46:37.076 --> 00:46:40.456
Chill out, man. You're on vacation.

520
00:46:42.034 --> 00:46:43.667
Two three seven.

521
00:46:46.991 --> 00:46:50.497
Hey, was there a Japanese girl
waiting in the lobby for somebody?

522
00:46:50.676 --> 00:46:53.783
No, think they left this morning.

523
00:46:53.959 --> 00:46:55.455
Yeah.

524
00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:00.050
I'm sorry, dude.

525
00:47:07.827 --> 00:47:10.237
Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me.

526
00:47:11.411 --> 00:47:14.324
It's okay. We are going to the spa.

527
00:47:14.493 --> 00:47:16.492
You will join us?

528
00:47:21.326 --> 00:47:23.302
You should come.

529
00:47:29.969 --> 00:47:32.002
Hey, Josh, call me
soon as you get this, man.

530
00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:34.418
I got locked in that club.
It was retarded, dude.

531
00:47:34.592 --> 00:47:36.225
I'm at the hostel.

532
00:47:39.281 --> 00:47:40.777
Svetlana!

533
00:47:42.664 --> 00:47:44.606
Svetlana!

534
00:48:15.424 --> 00:48:16.657
Hey!

535
00:48:22.828 --> 00:48:24.027
You little fucker.

536
00:48:41.285 --> 00:48:42.656
Jesus.

537
00:48:42.825 --> 00:48:44.561
Wait at hostel for your friends.

538
00:48:44.735 --> 00:48:47.236
They will look for you there
no matter what.

539
00:48:47.415 --> 00:48:51.698
Yeah, I know. But, see, my friend
Josh is the kind of guy who...

540
00:48:51.870 --> 00:48:55.685
He just wouldn't check out without
so much as leaving a note, you know.

541
00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:58.468
He's the responsible one.

542
00:48:58.636 --> 00:49:01.640
Yeah, but maybe he worried
his belongings get stolen...

543
00:49:01.819 --> 00:49:03.852
...so he take them when he go out.

544
00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:06.565
Someone misplace if he leaves note.

545
00:49:07.212 --> 00:49:08.650
It is not uncommon.

546
00:49:11.466 --> 00:49:14.001
Yeah, well, is there
anything else that I can do?

547
00:49:15.352 --> 00:49:17.990
There's nothing right now.

548
00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:19.633
We have his picture...

549
00:49:19.807 --> 00:49:23.051
...if we see him, or he is picked up,
or something happen...

550
00:49:23.224 --> 00:49:25.999
...we contact you at hostel, yeah?

551
00:49:26.172 --> 00:49:27.645
Okay.

552
00:49:29.655 --> 00:49:31.128
Where are you from?

553
00:49:32.034 --> 00:49:33.301
California.

554
00:49:35.249 --> 00:49:37.922
You are so far from home.

555
00:51:01.773 --> 00:51:04.777
Paxton. Come, have a drink.

556
00:51:07.937 --> 00:51:10.712
Hello, Mr. American.

557
00:51:12.962 --> 00:51:15.371
- Did you get my messages?
- Which one?

558
00:51:15.809 --> 00:51:17.076
There are so many.

559
00:51:17.250 --> 00:51:19.956
I call you back, but child answer.

560
00:51:20.465 --> 00:51:21.904
Yeah, I know.

561
00:51:22.074 --> 00:51:23.638
Have you seen Josh?

562
00:51:28.638 --> 00:51:30.340
In English, please.

563
00:51:31.486 --> 00:51:33.222
He is with your friend...

564
00:51:33.395 --> 00:51:35.267
...the King of the Swing.

565
00:51:35.874 --> 00:51:38.878
- He's with Oli.
- Why you leave last night?

566
00:51:39.424 --> 00:51:43.342
Did you not listen to my messages?
I got locked in a storage room.

567
00:51:43.511 --> 00:51:46.857
I don't know,
I got sick and passed out.

568
00:51:50.245 --> 00:51:53.191
- What?
- She said you met another girl.

569
00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:55.232
Where are my friends?

570
00:52:01.266 --> 00:52:03.299
The art show.

571
00:52:04.514 --> 00:52:07.084
- You mean like a museum?
- No, no, no.

572
00:52:07.932 --> 00:52:13.586
Not museum.
They went... How you say, for artist?

573
00:52:13.759 --> 00:52:16.797
- Exhibit.
- Exhibit for artist.

574
00:52:16.976 --> 00:52:18.472
No, that doesn't make any sense.

575
00:52:18.651 --> 00:52:20.318
Why? What is wrong?

576
00:52:20.493 --> 00:52:23.599
Well, they didn't leave a note.
They didn't call or do anything.

577
00:52:23.876 --> 00:52:25.246
They tell us to tell you.

578
00:52:25.417 --> 00:52:27.393
Yeah, but I tried calling them all day.

579
00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:30.666
Yes, but their phone, the battery die
and they do not have...

580
00:52:30.843 --> 00:52:32.876
How you say, for electricity?

581
00:52:33.055 --> 00:52:36.035
Converter. Okay, whatever,
where is this art show...

582
00:52:36.203 --> 00:52:37.836
...because I wanna go.

583
00:52:38.012 --> 00:52:39.850
- Have a drink.
- I don't want a drink.

584
00:52:40.022 --> 00:52:42.191
All right? I wanna see some art.

585
00:52:42.366 --> 00:52:45.039
Okay? So can we go?

586
00:52:57.843 --> 00:52:59.110
You're not going?

587
00:52:59.886 --> 00:53:01.919
I've seen this show.

588
00:53:08.361 --> 00:53:10.360
You want gum?

589
00:53:11.074 --> 00:53:12.445
No.

590
00:53:34.724 --> 00:53:36.288
Too bad for you.

591
00:53:42.863 --> 00:53:44.028
We are here.

592
00:54:43.059 --> 00:54:45.194
Are you coming or what?

593
00:54:47.279 --> 00:54:50.226
Excuse me. Excuse me.

594
00:54:50.528 --> 00:54:51.898
How is it in there?

595
00:54:53.309 --> 00:54:54.907
Be careful.

596
00:54:56.725 --> 00:54:58.061
Why is that?

597
00:54:58.802 --> 00:55:03.017
You could spend all your money...

598
00:55:03.424 --> 00:55:05.092
...in there.

599
00:55:40.506 --> 00:55:41.739
How much is it?

600
00:55:42.382 --> 00:55:44.016
For you, free.

601
00:56:01.376 --> 00:56:02.906
There.

602
00:56:04.759 --> 00:56:06.061
That's the show?

603
00:56:08.310 --> 00:56:09.874
Yes.

604
00:56:25.426 --> 00:56:28.065
- What?
- Nothing.

605
00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:33.129
You're so serious,
Mr. Serious American.

606
00:57:37.145 --> 00:57:39.212
You fucking whore.

607
00:57:40.729 --> 00:57:42.396
You fucking bitch.

608
00:57:43.041 --> 00:57:44.708
You fucking bitch!

609
00:57:46.055 --> 00:57:49.002
I get a lot of money for you...

610
00:57:49.171 --> 00:57:52.243
...and that make you my bitch.

611
00:57:54.932 --> 00:57:58.142
Fuck. Get the fuck off me!

612
00:57:59.689 --> 00:58:01.824
This is fucked!

613
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:03.233
Get the fuck off me!

614
00:58:03.976 --> 00:58:05.975
Get the fuck off me!

615
00:59:05.076 --> 00:59:06.515
Fuck.

616
00:59:36.262 --> 00:59:37.461
Talk.

617
00:59:40.918 --> 00:59:42.448
Talk. Speak.

618
00:59:43.765 --> 00:59:45.603
What the fuck
do you want me to say?

619
00:59:47.551 --> 00:59:49.253
American.

620
00:59:51.737 --> 00:59:53.142
No. No, wait!

621
00:59:53.313 --> 00:59:55.688
I'm not fucking American!

622
00:59:56.595 --> 00:59:59.771
I'm not fucking... Look at me.
I'm not fucking American.

623
01:00:00.615 --> 01:00:02.213
American.

624
01:00:04.801 --> 01:00:07.782
Please, what the fuck is this?

625
01:00:13.043 --> 01:00:16.492
Let me go. Please.

626
01:00:17.431 --> 01:00:20.377
I promise I won't tell anybody.

627
01:00:20.546 --> 01:00:24.087
Just please let me go.

628
01:00:50.459 --> 01:00:52.458
Don't. Don't.

629
01:00:52.636 --> 01:00:54.338
Please don't.

630
01:01:04.595 --> 01:01:06.628
Don't, please.

631
01:01:09.586 --> 01:01:11.185
God.

632
01:01:43.519 --> 01:01:45.518
Oh, please, stop!

633
01:01:45.697 --> 01:01:48.505
Please stop it. Please stop it.

634
01:01:50.085 --> 01:01:52.288
I know you don't wanna do this.

635
01:01:52.463 --> 01:01:53.936
Please don't do this.

636
01:06:12.002 --> 01:06:13.406
Fuck.

637
01:12:35.448 --> 01:12:37.286
Oh, shit.

638
01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:43.413
What the fuck?

639
01:13:44.419 --> 01:13:45.858
What do you think?

640
01:13:47.769 --> 01:13:49.333
How do I look?

641
01:13:49.511 --> 01:13:52.583
I feel like a butcher or a surgeon
or some shit, know what I mean?

642
01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:56.609
I feel fucking ridiculous in this thing,
but I guess you need it, huh?

643
01:13:59.258 --> 01:14:02.262
Yeah. I'll tell you something...

644
01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:06.415
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Wait a sec.

645
01:14:07.733 --> 01:14:09.537
How was it?

646
01:14:13.997 --> 01:14:15.402
Good.

647
01:14:15.572 --> 01:14:18.918
Well, goddamn, motherfucker,
for this money, it better be. Shit.

648
01:14:19.088 --> 01:14:21.395
What did you go for, a local?

649
01:14:21.568 --> 01:14:22.801
What, European?

650
01:14:24.649 --> 01:14:26.419
- American.
- An Amer..?

651
01:14:27.162 --> 01:14:30.143
Ain't that a bitch. Big spender.
I fucking... I love it.

652
01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:33.154
I just fucking love that shit.
You know what they got for me?

653
01:14:33.325 --> 01:14:35.358
They told me they lined up
something special.

654
01:14:35.537 --> 01:14:37.638
I've been waiting almost a week
for this shit.

655
01:14:37.814 --> 01:14:39.583
For 50 grand,
she better be worth it.

656
01:14:39.757 --> 01:14:41.996
But it's supposed to be
a real rush, right?

657
01:14:42.169 --> 01:14:46.851
It's like... They told me
it's like a real fucking rush, right?

658
01:14:47.026 --> 01:14:48.555
Come here.

659
01:14:49.504 --> 01:14:52.382
I've been all over the world.
You know, I've been everywhere.

660
01:14:52.553 --> 01:14:55.397
And the bottom line is,
pussy's pussy.

661
01:14:55.902 --> 01:14:59.683
You know, every strip club,
every whorehouse, every...

662
01:14:59.856 --> 01:15:01.523
It's all the same shit.

663
01:15:01.698 --> 01:15:05.741
I just fucked a girl two days ago, I don't
even remember the color of her tits.

664
01:15:06.086 --> 01:15:11.671
But this, this is something
you never forget, right?

665
01:15:13.456 --> 01:15:14.449
Right?

666
01:15:16.303 --> 01:15:18.107
- Never.
- Never, right.

667
01:15:19.150 --> 01:15:21.788
Let me show you something.
Pretty sweet. Check this out.

668
01:15:21.964 --> 01:15:24.945
What do you think of this?
Come on, let me see yours.

669
01:15:26.252 --> 01:15:29.164
Come on, let me see yours.
We're all in the same club.

670
01:15:30.003 --> 01:15:31.499
I'll be out in a second, guy.

671
01:15:32.482 --> 01:15:35.896
Can I ask you something personal?
Do you mind?

672
01:15:37.272 --> 01:15:38.505
How'd you do it?

673
01:15:40.086 --> 01:15:41.388
Did you do it real slow...

674
01:15:41.995 --> 01:15:44.634
...or did you just get it over with
right away?

675
01:15:44.809 --> 01:15:46.579
That's why I asked for
the fucking gun.

676
01:15:46.752 --> 01:15:48.853
Because I just wanted
to fucking do it quick.

677
01:15:49.030 --> 01:15:50.628
I just wanted to get it over with.

678
01:15:50.805 --> 01:15:53.409
But now I'm thinking maybe
I wanna feel it, you know?

679
01:15:53.586 --> 01:15:55.219
I wanna fucking feel that shit.

680
01:15:55.395 --> 01:15:58.741
So I don't know what to... I'm thinking...
What do you think I should do?

681
01:16:02.094 --> 01:16:03.898
- Make it quick.
- Make it quick.

682
01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:06.046
Yes.

683
01:16:06.717 --> 01:16:08.658
Yeah, that's... No, fuck that shit.

684
01:16:08.827 --> 01:16:12.105
Fuck this, too fucking American, dude.
I'm going fucking old school.

685
01:16:12.277 --> 01:16:13.978
Who wants this, motherfucker?

686
01:16:14.153 --> 01:16:16.859
Who wants this shit?
Come on, motherfucker.

687
01:16:17.034 --> 01:16:18.736
Bring it.

688
01:17:47.343 --> 01:17:48.713
Hey, buddy.

689
01:17:48.884 --> 01:17:51.590
Get your own fucking room.
I paid for this.

690
01:17:54.478 --> 01:17:55.814
What are you, fucking deaf?

691
01:18:04.728 --> 01:18:06.030
Kana.

692
01:18:13.672 --> 01:18:16.744
- Oh, my God.
- What do you want me to do, Kana?

693
01:18:19.367 --> 01:18:23.981
What? I don't understand
what you're saying. What?

694
01:18:30.186 --> 01:18:36.411
Fuck. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Hold still. Hold still.

695
01:18:36.584 --> 01:18:40.901
- Fuck. Oh, God. God.
- No. No!

696
01:18:41.140 --> 01:18:43.082
- Shit.
- No!

697
01:18:43.250 --> 01:18:46.630
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

698
01:19:04.153 --> 01:19:05.455
Fuck!

699
01:19:05.627 --> 01:19:07.065
Fuck!

700
01:19:10.852 --> 01:19:12.588
Fuck!

701
01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:31.543
We're gonna get the fuck
out of here, Kana.

702
01:20:55.700 --> 01:20:58.270
Move this fucking truck!

703
01:23:01.817 --> 01:23:03.050
Fuck.

704
01:23:15.853 --> 01:23:17.349
We're almost there.

705
01:23:22.787 --> 01:23:24.020
Oh, my God.

706
01:23:27.443 --> 01:23:28.710
Oh, no.

707
01:23:33.272 --> 01:23:34.505
Fuck.

708
01:25:07.165 --> 01:25:09.666
Kana.

709
01:25:11.185 --> 01:25:12.989
Kana.

710
01:25:22.607 --> 01:25:24.583
Come here.

711
01:25:33.696 --> 01:25:36.540
No. No, Kana. Kana.

712
01:25:40.898 --> 01:25:42.428
No, Kana.

713
01:26:37.776 --> 01:26:41.922
No, thank you.
I prefer to use my hands.

714
01:26:42.298 --> 01:26:45.770
I believe people have lost
their relationship with food.

715
01:26:45.950 --> 01:26:46.978
They do not think:

716
01:26:47.155 --> 01:26:50.433
"This is something who gave its life
so I would not go hungry."

717
01:26:50.606 --> 01:26:55.220
I like to have a connection
with something that died for me.

718
01:28:40.946 --> 01:28:42.922
Oh, Jesus.

719
01:28:54.915 --> 01:28:55.943
Goddamn!

720
01:28:56.121 --> 01:28:58.063
Fucker.

721
01:29:28.915 --> 01:29:30.286
No, please!

722
01:33:25.340 --> 01:33:28.286
I get a lot of money for you...

723
01:33:28.456 --> 01:33:31.596
...and that make you my bitch.
