00:02:20.417 --> 00:02:22.749
-Amsterdam, motherfucker!
-Okay.

3
00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:24.682
Come on, let's go.
Where are we going?

4
00:02:24.855 --> 00:02:26.846
Red-light district. Time for <i>sneepur</i>.

5
00:02:27.024 --> 00:02:29.618
Let's go to the coffee shop first,
then get some <i>sneepur</i>.

6
00:02:29.793 --> 00:02:32.057
Hey, l think the Anne Frank
house is around here.

7
00:02:35.098 --> 00:02:36.895
Did we come to Europe
just to smoke pot?

8
00:02:37.067 --> 00:02:38.591
l came all the way from Iceland.

9
00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.363
-Yeah, what if we did?
-We did that every day in college.

10
00:02:41.538 --> 00:02:43.699
Why not, like, you know,
check out a museum?

11
00:02:43.874 --> 00:02:45.842
No, you're right.
We should go to a museum.

12
00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:47.271
How about the hemp museum?

13
00:02:51.715 --> 00:02:53.444
Oli proudly presents...

14
00:02:55.452 --> 00:02:57.113
...Isabella.

15
00:02:58.288 --> 00:02:59.550
She's cute.

16
00:02:59.723 --> 00:03:03.090
But we can't rail a girl
who's in a coma.

17
00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.229
l think that's illegal
even in Amsterdam.

18
00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.597
-Hey, I’m just warming up, man.
-Fucking Oli.

19
00:03:08.765 --> 00:03:10.892
The Icelandic--
Oh, God, how are you?

20
00:03:11.068 --> 00:03:14.868
You want to get stoned?

21
00:03:15.405 --> 00:03:17.896
-This will wake you up.
-<i>What the fuck?

22
00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.640
This is good Amsterdam shit.

23
00:03:27.765 --> 00:03:30.165
That's the shit right there, dude.

24
00:03:30.601 --> 00:03:32.034
Trust me.

25
00:03:36.373 --> 00:03:38.136
Yeah.

26
00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:40.277
-It's all good, bro.
-Yeah, dude, smoke it!

27
00:03:42.413 --> 00:03:44.847
-Dude, what happened?
-Any Dutch people in Amsterdam?

28
00:04:01.065 --> 00:04:02.657
All right, this is my friend, Josh.

29
00:04:02.833 --> 00:04:05.097
-Well, hello.
-Hi.

30
00:04:07.871 --> 00:04:10.135
-Do you guys want another round?
-Yes, okay.

31
00:04:10.307 --> 00:04:11.774
Yeah?

32
00:04:15.646 --> 00:04:17.876
We will be right back.

33
00:04:20.851 --> 00:04:22.443
-What are you doing?
-What?

34
00:04:22.619 --> 00:04:26.783
Do you see a single other person
in here with a fucking fanny pack?

35
00:04:26.957 --> 00:04:27.981
Wait. There's a guy.

36
00:04:28.158 --> 00:04:30.490
Why don't you go have
fanny-pack sex with him...

37
00:04:30.661 --> 00:04:33.221
...and jizz all over each other's
storage compartments?

38
00:04:33.397 --> 00:04:36.389
l can't put my passport in my pocket.
Lt chafes my thighs, bitch.

39
00:04:36.567 --> 00:04:38.296
-All right?
-Yeah.

40
00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:39.629
Where's Oli?

41
00:04:44.408 --> 00:04:45.739
He's fucking genius.

42
00:04:49.179 --> 00:04:52.342
<i>Sneepur</i> alert, 3 o'clock.

43
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.747
-She smokes.
-Dude, it's Europe!

44
00:04:54.918 --> 00:04:58.285
Every fucking chick smokes.
Stop being a pussy.

45
00:04:58.455 --> 00:05:01.424
You are so easy sometimes.

46
00:05:01.792 --> 00:05:05.990
The power of the pack is yours.
I’m out of here.

47
00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.060
I’m sorry.

48
00:05:15.239 --> 00:05:17.469
Yeah, l--
No, l don't even speak Dutch.

49
00:05:17.641 --> 00:05:19.734
No, I’m sorry, l--

50
00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.640
Get off me, you fucking
faggot-ass elf. Fuck off.

51
00:05:22.813 --> 00:05:24.405
-Hey, what the fuck?
-Hey. Hey.

52
00:05:24.581 --> 00:05:26.344
Come on, faggot.

53
00:05:29.253 --> 00:05:32.347
-Fucker!
-Get your fucking hands off me.

54
00:05:32.523 --> 00:05:35.048
-I’m an American, l got rights.
-Get the fuck out.

55
00:05:35.225 --> 00:05:38.524
-Your fucking club sucks ass, bro.
-Kiss my American ass, fucker.

56
00:05:38.695 --> 00:05:40.526
-Fuck you.
-Let's get out of here, bro.

57
00:05:40.697 --> 00:05:42.665
Hey, l don't know why
you guys are waiting.

58
00:05:42.833 --> 00:05:45.996
It's a fucking fag fest in there.
Wall-to-wall fucking cock.

59
00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:48.570
You need one of these
to get in, bro. Sorry.

60
00:05:48.739 --> 00:05:50.229
That shit was classic, dude.

61
00:05:50.407 --> 00:05:53.399
He was gonna throw down
with a 400-pound Dutchman.

62
00:05:53.577 --> 00:05:55.943
I’m fucking awesome!

63
00:05:56.713 --> 00:05:57.941
l don't fucking know what--

64
00:05:58.115 --> 00:06:00.948
l thought you were a Jew, man.
This guy's a fucking Israeli!

65
00:06:01.118 --> 00:06:02.676
You are fucking Israeli.

66
00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.587
Oh, God, l hope bestiality
is legal in Amsterdam...

67
00:06:06.757 --> 00:06:09.783
...because that girl's a fucking hog.
Look at that, man.

68
00:06:10.194 --> 00:06:12.287
Hey, guys,
l think she likes me, man.

69
00:06:12.463 --> 00:06:15.762
Oh, look at that.
Josh, my gift to you, man.

70
00:06:15.933 --> 00:06:19.733
Thanks, but paying to do whatever
you want to someone isn't a turn-on.

71
00:06:19.903 --> 00:06:23.270
How are you gonna get over your chick
if you don't bang some new pussy?

72
00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.704
You can't go home
without getting some hot chick.

73
00:06:25.876 --> 00:06:27.901
l agree, but l shouldn't
have to pay for it.

74
00:06:28.078 --> 00:06:30.137
Hey, come on, I’m paying, man.

75
00:06:56.006 --> 00:06:57.564
Hey.

76
00:06:58.308 --> 00:07:00.037
Are you okay?

77
00:07:01.245 --> 00:07:04.009
Hello? Hello?

78
00:07:09.153 --> 00:07:12.179
Hey, close the door.
You watch, you pay.

79
00:07:12.356 --> 00:07:14.051
Sorry. Jesus.

80
00:07:14.625 --> 00:07:16.388
You're up, slugger.

81
00:07:17.194 --> 00:07:20.857
Man, I’m fucking-- I’m tired, man.
l can, like, barely stand up.

82
00:07:21.031 --> 00:07:23.022
Josh, you want
to be a fucking writer?

83
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.964
How about some life experience,
right there in that room.

84
00:07:28.772 --> 00:07:31.104
-What do we have in here?
-Hey, you watch, you pay.

85
00:07:31.275 --> 00:07:33.709
l pay. l pay, man. Come on.

86
00:07:42.319 --> 00:07:43.308
Hey.

87
00:07:44.488 --> 00:07:46.615
Come, sit.

88
00:07:50.127 --> 00:07:52.857
Your friends are so funny.

89
00:07:53.564 --> 00:07:55.395
Yeah.

90
00:07:56.333 --> 00:07:59.928
You can wash over here, by sink.

91
00:08:14.851 --> 00:08:16.409
Lt was fine.

92
00:08:16.687 --> 00:08:19.815
What do you mean? That bitch had
the best fucking tits in Amsterdam.

93
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:22.220
Lt was fine. Lt was whatever.

94
00:08:26.964 --> 00:08:28.659
What was that?

95
00:08:28.832 --> 00:08:31.801
-It's fucking after curfew, man.
-Curfew? What are we, 1 3?

96
00:08:31.969 --> 00:08:35.530
Let us the fuck in,
we're freezing our balls off.

97
00:08:35.706 --> 00:08:38.300
We paid to stay here.
They can't just, like, lock us out.

98
00:08:38.475 --> 00:08:39.737
This is bullshit.

99
00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:41.138
Hello?

100
00:08:41.311 --> 00:08:42.903
Open the fucking door.

101
00:08:47.918 --> 00:08:50.910
-What did you tell him?
-He just told them to let us in.

102
00:08:53.757 --> 00:08:55.850
-Shut up!
-Jesus.

103
00:08:56.026 --> 00:08:58.790
Shut the fuck up,
you fucking Americans.

104
00:08:58.962 --> 00:09:00.793
Hey, l know what to do.

105
00:09:04.935 --> 00:09:06.368
Shut up.

106
00:09:07.704 --> 00:09:10.264
Hey, hey, guys. Up here.
Climb quickly.

107
00:09:10.807 --> 00:09:12.536
Come on.

108
00:09:12.843 --> 00:09:13.867
Go. Go, go, go.

109
00:09:21.551 --> 00:09:23.041
Oh, don't mind them.

110
00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:27.078
They are so fucked up they don't
know what planet they are on.

111
00:09:29.359 --> 00:09:31.953
-Thanks, bro.
-It's no problem.

112
00:09:32.129 --> 00:09:35.121
Not everyone
want to kill Americans.

113
00:09:36.133 --> 00:09:37.725
Paxton.

114
00:09:40.837 --> 00:09:43.101
Alexei. But call me Alex.

115
00:09:43.273 --> 00:09:47.869
What's up, Alex.
This is Josh and Oli.

116
00:09:48.312 --> 00:09:50.075
Guys, this is fucking awesome, man.

117
00:09:50.247 --> 00:09:52.807
I’m the first in line for <i>sneepur</i>.

118
00:09:54.284 --> 00:09:56.878
Oh, that's Icelandic for ''clit.''

119
00:09:58.322 --> 00:10:01.189
Clitoris or clitoris,
however you wanna say that.

120
00:10:01.358 --> 00:10:02.416
Women have it.

121
00:10:02.592 --> 00:10:06.619
It's, like, right near the labia.
Like, it hangs.

122
00:10:06.797 --> 00:10:09.994
Oh, yeah.
Very good <i>sneepur</i> in Iceland.

123
00:10:10.167 --> 00:10:12.567
-Yeah.
-Come on, guys, have a seat.

124
00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:21.843
Where you travel to?

125
00:10:22.012 --> 00:10:25.175
We started in Paris,
which is where we met this drifter.

126
00:10:25.349 --> 00:10:26.941
Anyway, we went all over France...

127
00:10:27.117 --> 00:10:30.052
...and then Switzerland, Belgium,
and now we're in Amsterdam.

128
00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:32.711
Yeah, kind of over Amsterdam.
Way too many Americans.

129
00:10:32.889 --> 00:10:35.915
Yeah, but Oli's got a friend
with a flat in Barcelona...

130
00:10:36.093 --> 00:10:39.290
...and he's supposed to hook us up
with some hot-ass <i>senoritas</i>.

131
00:10:39.796 --> 00:10:41.423
Looking for girls?

132
00:10:43.533 --> 00:10:44.761
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

133
00:10:46.002 --> 00:10:48.368
So talk to Alex.

134
00:10:48.839 --> 00:10:52.434
He open up the pussy
all over the Europe.

135
00:10:52.609 --> 00:10:53.769
l can help you.

136
00:10:54.311 --> 00:10:57.678
Oh, shit.
Alex is a pimp, apparently.

137
00:10:58.448 --> 00:11:00.973
Thanks, bro,
but l think we'll be okay.

138
00:11:01.151 --> 00:11:02.618
-Yeah.
-Good.

139
00:11:08.692 --> 00:11:10.387
You looking for girls like this?

140
00:11:19.669 --> 00:11:22.638
These are fucking magnificent.

141
00:11:23.774 --> 00:11:26.675
-Who the hell are these girls?
-You have to go east, my friend.

142
00:11:26.843 --> 00:11:28.902
This is where the best girls are.

143
00:11:29.079 --> 00:11:30.410
The best.

144
00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:32.411
How far east?

145
00:11:32.582 --> 00:11:35.517
You can go as far as Ukraine,
around Odessa.

146
00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.648
These girls l met
at this one hostel in Slovakia...

147
00:11:39.823 --> 00:11:41.415
...just outside Bratislava.

148
00:11:41.992 --> 00:11:45.018
The girls there are so hot
you cannot believe it.

149
00:11:45.929 --> 00:11:48.830
And they love anyone foreign,
especially American.

150
00:11:49.232 --> 00:11:51.598
They hear your accent,
they fuck you.

151
00:11:51.768 --> 00:11:54.931
So wait, this place
is near Bratislava?

152
00:11:55.105 --> 00:11:56.197
Josh.

153
00:11:56.873 --> 00:11:59.171
You won't find this hostel
in any guidebook.

154
00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:03.505
Barcelona, so many Americans.

155
00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.807
But Slovakia? No one there.

156
00:12:05.982 --> 00:12:09.884
There is so much pussy, and because
of the war, there are no guys.

157
00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:13.346
You go to this hostel,
you will have any girl you want.

158
00:12:13.523 --> 00:12:16.117
They go crazy for any foreigner.

159
00:12:16.293 --> 00:12:18.056
You just...

160
00:12:19.463 --> 00:12:21.192
...take them.

161
00:12:49.192 --> 00:12:50.989
Fuck, man.

162
00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:57.027
Can't you keep your Viking ass
in your pants for, like, two seconds?

163
00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.997
Hey, man, l shaved my ass
just for you.

164
00:12:59.169 --> 00:13:01.228
-Okay, all right.
-My Viking balls too.

165
00:13:01.404 --> 00:13:02.837
Okay, stop.

166
00:13:14.784 --> 00:13:16.308
I’m sorry.

167
00:13:16.486 --> 00:13:18.010
My daughter.

168
00:13:18.188 --> 00:13:20.179
She miss her daddy,
and Daddy miss her.

169
00:13:20.357 --> 00:13:21.949
Yeah, no problem, dude, it's cool.

170
00:13:25.729 --> 00:13:27.822
-Saskia.
-Cute.

171
00:13:28.331 --> 00:13:31.960
-She's adorable.
-She's a little cutie, yeah.

172
00:13:33.737 --> 00:13:36.205
This is Svanhildur, my daughter.

173
00:13:36.373 --> 00:13:37.931
-Very pretty.
-She's 6.

174
00:13:38.575 --> 00:13:40.133
She's starting school this year.

175
00:13:40.844 --> 00:13:42.744
Wait, you have a daughter?

176
00:13:42.913 --> 00:13:45.746
Yeah, of course, my horse.
l was married for eight years.

177
00:13:47.217 --> 00:13:49.515
Okay. All right.

178
00:13:49.686 --> 00:13:52.450
-You are on vacation?
-Yeah, we're backpacking.

179
00:13:52.622 --> 00:13:54.089
Our next stop is Bratislava.

180
00:13:56.826 --> 00:13:59.727
-What?
-Slovakia.

181
00:14:01.565 --> 00:14:03.533
You will like it.

182
00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.132
Casino, girls.

183
00:14:08.305 --> 00:14:11.331
You can pay to do anything.

184
00:14:11.508 --> 00:14:13.271
Anything.

185
00:14:14.311 --> 00:14:17.303
-How are the girls?
-Very beautiful.

186
00:14:17.914 --> 00:14:20.815
They will love you.
Handsome American like you.

187
00:14:22.986 --> 00:14:26.478
Handsome devil. He is handsome.

188
00:14:27.357 --> 00:14:30.520
That's-- That's awkward.
That's awkward.

189
00:14:38.935 --> 00:14:41.062
That's awkward too.

190
00:14:42.839 --> 00:14:45.899
-You need a fork there, chief?
-No, no, no.

191
00:14:46.076 --> 00:14:48.601
l prefer to use my hands.

192
00:14:49.479 --> 00:14:51.174
l believe...

193
00:14:51.481 --> 00:14:55.315
...people have
lost their relationship with food.

194
00:14:56.686 --> 00:14:58.051
They do not think:

195
00:14:58.221 --> 00:15:01.884
''This is something who gave its life
so l would not go hungry.''

196
00:15:02.626 --> 00:15:05.959
l like to have a connection
with something that died for me.

197
00:15:06.129 --> 00:15:07.528
l appreciate it more.

198
00:15:08.732 --> 00:15:10.165
Well, I’m vegetarian.

199
00:15:10.333 --> 00:15:12.801
And l am a meat-eater.

200
00:15:12.969 --> 00:15:14.903
It's human nature.

201
00:15:15.839 --> 00:15:18.034
Well, I’m human,
and it's not in my nature.

202
00:15:19.009 --> 00:15:21.739
Tell me, what is your nature?

203
00:15:22.579 --> 00:15:25.013
Don't touch!
Don't fucking touch me!

204
00:15:25.482 --> 00:15:27.074
I’m sorry.

205
00:15:28.518 --> 00:15:29.951
Excuse me.

206
00:15:31.588 --> 00:15:33.021
Fucking freak.

207
00:15:34.858 --> 00:15:35.916
Jesus.

208
00:15:39.729 --> 00:15:42.562
Edward Saladhands
just groped Josh.

209
00:15:44.167 --> 00:15:46.465
Dude, you finally hooked up.
That's awesome.

210
00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:49.068
Yeah, that's fucking hilarious.

211
00:16:54.237 --> 00:16:55.932
Or we could visit some factories.

212
00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:58.739
Should be cool.

213
00:16:58.908 --> 00:17:00.739
Ln this area...

214
00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:05.438
...we make plastic for Slovakia.

215
00:17:07.517 --> 00:17:08.745
ls that so?

216
00:17:31.174 --> 00:17:32.903
Look at this.

217
00:18:16.586 --> 00:18:19.885
-Nice, eh?
-This is a fucking hostel?

218
00:18:21.024 --> 00:18:23.288
Holy shit.

219
00:18:29.399 --> 00:18:32.334
You can have that, man.
I’m too scared.

220
00:18:36.472 --> 00:18:38.337
Hey, hey. The party has arrived.

221
00:18:39.676 --> 00:18:42.236
-You are saved from boredom.
-Let me guess.

222
00:18:42.412 --> 00:18:45.848
You must be
the King of the Swing.

223
00:18:46.015 --> 00:18:48.245
You made a reservation under
''King of the Swing?''

224
00:18:48.418 --> 00:18:50.181
-Yeah, of course, my horse.
-I’m sorry.

225
00:18:50.353 --> 00:18:54.221
-He doesn't get out of his cage much.
-l can see that.

226
00:18:56.893 --> 00:18:58.690
Here are your keys.

227
00:18:58.962 --> 00:19:01.795
You leave your passports
at the desk.

228
00:19:05.668 --> 00:19:08.728
That was taken when l was like 1 3.
l was kind of husky.

229
00:19:08.905 --> 00:19:10.270
Not anymore, though, you know?

230
00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.409
Do you have any private rooms?
We're probably gonna need them.

231
00:19:13.576 --> 00:19:17.740
The rooms are semiprivate,
so you will have roommates.

232
00:19:17.914 --> 00:19:20.815
Roommates, huh? That's gay.

233
00:19:28.791 --> 00:19:30.224
Sorry.

234
00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:33.788
-Oh, my God.
-It's okay.

235
00:19:33.963 --> 00:19:36.898
The room is yours.
We are going to the spa.

236
00:19:39.402 --> 00:19:41.233
You should come.

237
00:19:45.074 --> 00:19:46.837
Spa.

238
00:20:01.758 --> 00:20:03.623
Jugs.

239
00:20:07.297 --> 00:20:09.663
-Hey.
-Hello.

240
00:20:09.832 --> 00:20:11.823
Oh, Jesus.

241
00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:15.929
-Hi. Hey.
-Hi.

242
00:20:19.008 --> 00:20:20.942
How you doing?

243
00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:26.778
I’m so happy l shaved my balls.

244
00:20:28.885 --> 00:20:32.048
What? l have the smoothest balls
in Iceland.

245
00:20:32.221 --> 00:20:35.281
-You wanna see?
-No, no, no, you're not-- I’m good.

246
00:20:35.458 --> 00:20:37.722
Put your anteater away,
it's totally creepy.

247
00:20:39.228 --> 00:20:42.129
-You're not from Iceland, no?
-No. Fuck, no. American.

248
00:20:42.298 --> 00:20:44.994
Yeah, unlike him,
l had my foreskin removed at birth.

249
00:20:45.568 --> 00:20:47.798
Hygiene and-- Am l talking?

250
00:20:48.204 --> 00:20:50.729
-I’m Josh.
-Natalya.

251
00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:53.167
-And this is Svetlana.
-Hi.

252
00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:55.505
Hi, I’m Paxton.

253
00:20:56.012 --> 00:20:58.674
-And this is Oli.
-The King of the Swing.

254
00:20:59.148 --> 00:21:01.446
Hello.

255
00:21:02.785 --> 00:21:04.946
Face on the ass. Never gets old.

256
00:21:05.121 --> 00:21:06.588
Jesus.

257
00:21:06.756 --> 00:21:08.690
So where are you girls from?

258
00:21:08.858 --> 00:21:11.122
I’m from Italy,
but my parents are Russian.

259
00:21:11.627 --> 00:21:13.356
Prague.

260
00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:17.322
Prague's cool. Kafka.

261
00:21:17.834 --> 00:21:20.962
So, Natalya....

262
00:21:21.137 --> 00:21:23.765
-Yeah?
-You're Russian, eh?

263
00:21:45.294 --> 00:21:48.957
Oh, my God.
Look, there are too many girls.

264
00:21:52.335 --> 00:21:54.963
-This is awesome.
-Yes.

265
00:22:36.179 --> 00:22:38.647
l mean, l was a senior,
you know, she was a junior...

266
00:22:38.815 --> 00:22:41.215
...and then l graduated,
and it was weird, you know.

267
00:22:41.384 --> 00:22:45.753
l mean, I’m totally over it.
It's-- You know, it's cool.

268
00:22:45.922 --> 00:22:47.355
It's okay.

269
00:22:47.523 --> 00:22:49.047
Look, Vala is here.

270
00:22:49.225 --> 00:22:52.717
-Who?
-Vala, from front desk. Vala.

271
00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:56.794
-All right, Oli.
-Hey, l told you, man.

272
00:22:56.966 --> 00:22:59.059
I’m the King of the Swing.

273
00:22:59.602 --> 00:23:02.571
Come, let's dance.

274
00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:13.313
-Does the cigarette bother you?
-No, it's--

275
00:23:13.483 --> 00:23:15.246
l put away.

276
00:23:15.418 --> 00:23:17.682
It's fine, l....

277
00:23:17.854 --> 00:23:20.755
I’m gonna go get some fresh air.

278
00:23:21.023 --> 00:23:23.924
But I’ll be back, okay?

279
00:23:46.215 --> 00:23:47.443
Cigarette.

280
00:23:48.551 --> 00:23:50.018
Cigarette.

281
00:23:50.553 --> 00:23:51.747
Aren't you a little young?

282
00:23:51.921 --> 00:23:53.718
-Dollar.
-What?

283
00:23:54.357 --> 00:23:55.619
Dollar.

284
00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:03.225
-Dollar.
-Here you go.

285
00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:12.974
Here, children commit
the most crime.

286
00:24:13.409 --> 00:24:16.537
They don't care.
They will attack anyone.

287
00:24:17.113 --> 00:24:19.741
-You're okay?
-Yeah, yeah. Thank you.

288
00:24:22.185 --> 00:24:24.210
Hey, let me buy you a drink.

289
00:24:24.487 --> 00:24:25.920
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

290
00:24:27.523 --> 00:24:29.457
Hey, Josh.

291
00:24:29.625 --> 00:24:31.092
Faggot.

292
00:24:31.427 --> 00:24:33.895
Go with your friends. It's okay.

293
00:24:34.063 --> 00:24:35.894
l wanted to say sorry about earlier.

294
00:24:36.065 --> 00:24:38.090
About the way l reacted.

295
00:24:38.601 --> 00:24:40.262
We cool?

296
00:24:45.074 --> 00:24:48.305
l would have done
the same thing at your age.

297
00:24:50.513 --> 00:24:52.572
It's not easy...

298
00:24:53.182 --> 00:24:55.412
...but from my experience...

299
00:24:55.585 --> 00:24:58.918
...choosing to have a family
was the right choice for me.

300
00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:02.621
Now l have my little girl...

301
00:25:02.792 --> 00:25:06.558
...who means more to me
than anything in the world.

302
00:25:07.396 --> 00:25:10.388
But you should do...

303
00:25:10.566 --> 00:25:12.932
...whatever's right for you.

304
00:25:15.104 --> 00:25:18.164
Excuse me, it's my turn now.

305
00:25:33.923 --> 00:25:35.754
Should we be doing this
with them there?

306
00:25:35.925 --> 00:25:37.722
Yeah, it's okay.

307
00:25:39.295 --> 00:25:43.459
-Yeah, baby. Josh, give it to me, baby.
-Okay, all right. Okay, stop!

308
00:25:43.633 --> 00:25:46.101
-All right.
-Come on, big boy.

309
00:25:46.269 --> 00:25:48.669
-We go to spa.
-Spa.

310
00:25:48.838 --> 00:25:51.500
Spa, spa, spa.
Being dirty while getting clean.

311
00:25:51.674 --> 00:25:53.232
Bye.

312
00:27:18.961 --> 00:27:20.724
Mission accomplished.

313
00:27:23.966 --> 00:27:27.834
You know that Amsterdam kid
with the thing on his lip?

314
00:27:28.003 --> 00:27:30.733
I’m gonna send him
a really nice thank-you note.

315
00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.032
Be quiet.

316
00:27:36.879 --> 00:27:39.143
They're showering together.

317
00:27:42.118 --> 00:27:44.416
Shit, man. We're never leaving here.

318
00:27:46.322 --> 00:27:48.187
l guess Oli's not back yet.

319
00:27:48.357 --> 00:27:51.121
No, dude, he probably
took that desk girl home.

320
00:27:51.293 --> 00:27:52.817
We'll see him at breakfast.

321
00:28:06.642 --> 00:28:10.840
-What's the name?
-Oli Ericson, 23 7.

322
00:28:13.783 --> 00:28:16.377
How are we supposed to
understand this without subtitles?

323
00:28:16.552 --> 00:28:17.678
Fucking gay.

324
00:28:17.853 --> 00:28:19.878
Yeah, he checked out this morning.

325
00:28:20.556 --> 00:28:22.456
You mean he took his
passport to go out?

326
00:28:22.625 --> 00:28:24.991
No, it say he checked out
this morning.

327
00:28:25.928 --> 00:28:28.158
-When this morning?
-l don't know exact time.

328
00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:30.491
l could find out tomorrow.

329
00:28:36.806 --> 00:28:39.707
Hey, Oli, it's Pax.
Are you still with that chick?

330
00:28:39.875 --> 00:28:41.809
Can l leave a note
in case he comes back?

331
00:28:41.977 --> 00:28:44.002
Okay, cool. Yeah.

332
00:28:47.249 --> 00:28:48.807
All right.

333
00:28:53.088 --> 00:28:56.353
He's probably still with Vala.
When she call me, l call you, okay?

334
00:28:56.525 --> 00:28:58.322
Okay.

335
00:28:58.494 --> 00:29:00.052
-We see you later, right?
-Yeah.

336
00:29:00.729 --> 00:29:02.321
Okay.

337
00:29:03.399 --> 00:29:04.627
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

338
00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:09.464
Oli, hey, it's me again.
We're gonna go into town, so call us.

339
00:29:09.638 --> 00:29:11.299
You're gay.
Damn voice mail again.

340
00:29:11.474 --> 00:29:14.671
-Hi! Hi! Hi!
-Hi.

341
00:29:14.844 --> 00:29:16.539
Your friend.

342
00:29:17.813 --> 00:29:20.873
-What the hell?
-Your friend, my friend.

343
00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:22.915
What does that say?

344
00:29:23.953 --> 00:29:25.614
<i>Sayonara.</i> Your friend.

345
00:29:25.788 --> 00:29:27.415
What, they left? Like, together?

346
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:30.491
That doesn't make any sense.
Oli doesn't even like Asian girls.

347
00:29:30.659 --> 00:29:32.251
l mean, no offense, but--

348
00:29:32.428 --> 00:29:33.952
When did she send this to you?

349
00:29:34.129 --> 00:29:36.256
This picture. Today?

350
00:29:36.799 --> 00:29:39.734
Could you do me a favor
and send this picture to my phone?

351
00:29:39.902 --> 00:29:40.891
This picture.

352
00:29:43.272 --> 00:29:44.637
That water looks fucking cold.

353
00:29:44.807 --> 00:29:47.332
You know, if you fell in,
you'd die in 90 seconds.

354
00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:49.944
Dude, did l tell you l saw
a girl drown when l was 8?

355
00:29:50.613 --> 00:29:52.911
-Where?
-Lake Michigan.

356
00:29:53.082 --> 00:29:58.019
Lt was fucked up, man.
This little girl, probably 4 or 5.

357
00:29:58.387 --> 00:30:01.845
We made eye contact,
which was a weird thing, you know...

358
00:30:02.024 --> 00:30:04.618
...and she was yelling for me
to help her.

359
00:30:04.793 --> 00:30:06.158
Yeah? What did you do?

360
00:30:06.328 --> 00:30:10.162
l ran to the lifeguard, who was busy
talking to her boyfriend at the time...

361
00:30:10.332 --> 00:30:12.892
...and l yelled, you know,
''There's this girl drowning.''

362
00:30:13.068 --> 00:30:15.935
And she couldn't see her.
Probably thought I was making it up.

363
00:30:16.105 --> 00:30:20.132
And then a second later all you could
hear was this horrible screaming.

364
00:30:20.609 --> 00:30:22.907
Lt was that little girl's mother, dude.

365
00:30:23.612 --> 00:30:25.011
Her kid was dead.

366
00:30:25.481 --> 00:30:28.245
-Jesus.
-I had nightmares for years after that.

367
00:30:28.417 --> 00:30:32.148
I mean, I'd wake up every fucking
night hearing that mother scream.

368
00:30:32.321 --> 00:30:33.913
I just....

369
00:30:34.089 --> 00:30:35.886
I just felt like I could have
done more.

370
00:30:36.058 --> 00:30:38.652
You did the right thing.
Could've been a double drowning.

371
00:30:38.827 --> 00:30:41.057
Yeah, well, I didn't see it
that way at the time.

372
00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:44.859
All I knew was this little girl was dead
and her mother's life was ruined.

373
00:30:45.034 --> 00:30:47.195
What makes you think of this now?

374
00:30:51.373 --> 00:30:52.431
Bubble gum.

375
00:30:53.642 --> 00:30:56.372
-Sorry, kid.
-No, no. Give him some.

376
00:31:00.049 --> 00:31:01.880
What are you doing?

377
00:31:02.985 --> 00:31:05.545
These fucking kids are dangerous.

378
00:31:06.322 --> 00:31:07.789
Hey, Oli.

379
00:31:07.957 --> 00:31:10.152
-Hey, Oli.
-Hey.

380
00:31:12.795 --> 00:31:14.695
-Hey.
-Hey.

381
00:31:14.863 --> 00:31:18.162
-Hey, Oli. Hey!
-Oli!

382
00:31:23.172 --> 00:31:24.969
It's your lucky day, Josh.

383
00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:26.767
A museum.

384
00:32:12.554 --> 00:32:13.885
How's it hanging?

385
00:32:16.025 --> 00:32:18.789
-What the fuck?
-Holy shit.

386
00:32:18.961 --> 00:32:20.929
-He got you.
-Yeah, that's hilarious.

387
00:32:21.096 --> 00:32:22.324
Okay.

388
00:32:23.032 --> 00:32:24.590
Hey, Oli.

389
00:32:26.301 --> 00:32:27.996
Hey, Oli.

390
00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:29.467
Hey, hey.

391
00:32:31.373 --> 00:32:32.670
Excuse me?

392
00:32:33.475 --> 00:32:36.603
I’m sorry, I thought you
were someone else.

393
00:32:36.779 --> 00:32:39.407
Well, I’m not.

394
00:32:39.581 --> 00:32:41.173
Where did you get that jacket?

395
00:32:43.585 --> 00:32:47.112
-Hey, I’m talking to you, man.
-Get your fucking hands off me.

396
00:32:48.357 --> 00:32:51.417
This is my jacket.

397
00:33:07.509 --> 00:33:09.170
It's from Oli.

398
00:33:10.646 --> 00:33:11.635
'I’m go home''?

399
00:34:10.372 --> 00:34:12.966
I don't know,
maybe his battery died.

400
00:34:14.176 --> 00:34:16.610
Hey, Kana, when are you leaving?

401
00:34:17.913 --> 00:34:21.212
I’m sorry. When are you going away?

402
00:34:21.817 --> 00:34:23.944
Tomorrow, I go.

403
00:34:24.119 --> 00:34:25.484
Okay, because we may go too.

404
00:34:25.654 --> 00:34:29.454
Do you wanna go to the train with us?
To the train station?

405
00:34:31.193 --> 00:34:33.161
Tomorrow, train?

406
00:34:33.328 --> 00:34:34.989
Yeah, yeah.

407
00:34:37.733 --> 00:34:39.633
-Hello, Josh.
-Hey.

408
00:34:39.802 --> 00:34:41.736
-Hey.
-Come, we go for disco?

409
00:34:41.904 --> 00:34:45.601
Actually, I just wanna find my friend
and get the fuck out of here.

410
00:34:48.010 --> 00:34:50.740
Okay, we'll see you.

411
00:34:56.518 --> 00:35:00.215
Hey, guys, hold up a sec.
We'll be right out.

412
00:35:00.389 --> 00:35:02.016
Okay.

413
00:35:04.459 --> 00:35:06.984
-Josh, come here, dude.
-Yeah, what?

414
00:35:07.496 --> 00:35:10.727
It's not their fault Oli disappeared,
so stop acting like it is.

415
00:35:10.899 --> 00:35:13.026
-I’m annoyed he'd ditch us.
-I’m pissed too.

416
00:35:13.202 --> 00:35:14.692
But we're not in America.

417
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:17.805
I mean, people meet each other
and split without saying shit.

418
00:35:18.273 --> 00:35:19.900
It's just how they do it over here.

419
00:35:20.075 --> 00:35:22.976
As well as we may think we know Oli,
we don't really know him.

420
00:35:23.145 --> 00:35:24.669
He could've gone
somewhere with that girl.

421
00:35:24.686 --> 00:35:28.240
Fuck, maybe he's in Iceland.
The guy's got a daughter.

422
00:35:28.417 --> 00:35:29.748
So let's look at our options.

423
00:35:29.918 --> 00:35:33.183
We can A, fuck these girls one more
night and then head to Barcelona...

424
00:35:33.355 --> 00:35:36.688
...or B, not fuck them,
then head to Barcelona anyway.

425
00:35:36.859 --> 00:35:40.659
Think about it. When I’m studying for
the bar and you're writing your thesis...

426
00:35:40.829 --> 00:35:42.922
...this is the shit
we're gonna think about.

427
00:35:43.098 --> 00:35:46.158
Okay. All right, he doesn't show up,
it's his problem.

428
00:35:46.335 --> 00:35:48.667
-It's his problem.
-All right.

429
00:35:48.837 --> 00:35:50.964
All right.

430
00:35:51.139 --> 00:35:54.438
Hey, Kana, you wanna go
to the disco with us?

431
00:35:54.843 --> 00:35:56.367
You know, disco?
Dancing?

432
00:35:57.446 --> 00:35:58.879
No?

433
00:36:39.821 --> 00:36:41.914
Josh?

434
00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:44.854
-I’m gonna go back.
-Are you okay?

435
00:36:45.027 --> 00:36:46.358
I’m, like-- I’m tired.

436
00:36:46.528 --> 00:36:49.088
Actually, I have, like, a headache.

437
00:36:49.932 --> 00:36:52.025
If you want, l will go with you.

438
00:36:52.634 --> 00:36:56.695
No, no, no, I’ll just see you
back at the room.

439
00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:00.867
Goodbye.

440
00:37:05.914 --> 00:37:07.006
<i>Fucking pussy.

441
00:37:39.514 --> 00:37:41.038
-Josh.
-Vala.

442
00:37:41.216 --> 00:37:43.047
You don't look well.

443
00:37:43.218 --> 00:37:45.448
-No, l--
-Here, let me help you.

444
00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:48.680
l feel sick.

445
00:37:59.201 --> 00:38:02.068
Where is...?
Where is Oli?

446
00:38:02.237 --> 00:38:04.262
You need rest.

447
00:38:31.867 --> 00:38:33.960
Where's the restroom?

448
00:38:34.603 --> 00:38:37.037
Past the bar, in the back.

449
00:38:44.046 --> 00:38:45.104
You guys cool?

450
00:38:45.847 --> 00:38:48.213
-Vodka Red Bull.
-Vodka Red Bull, <i>danke</i>.

451
00:38:53.088 --> 00:38:54.555
Yeah.

452
00:39:35.530 --> 00:39:37.327
Hey!

453
00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:40.231
Hey!

454
00:40:03.291 --> 00:40:05.156
Open the door.

455
00:40:25.914 --> 00:40:27.779
Oh, fuck.

456
00:40:33.421 --> 00:40:34.911
What the f--?

457
00:40:53.108 --> 00:40:54.973
Oh, fuck.

458
00:41:09.357 --> 00:41:11.985
What...? Who are you?

459
00:41:12.527 --> 00:41:14.154
What the f--? Where the fuck am l?

460
00:41:14.329 --> 00:41:16.797
What the fuck is this shit?

461
00:41:17.666 --> 00:41:19.861
Please, please--
Fuck. Please, please, please--

462
00:41:20.035 --> 00:41:22.265
l didn't fucking do shit to you,
what the fuck!

463
00:41:24.372 --> 00:41:26.272
Please, please, what the--?

464
00:41:26.441 --> 00:41:29.877
Please, no, sir.
Please fucking stop. Please!

465
00:41:30.045 --> 00:41:31.205
What the fuck?

466
00:41:31.813 --> 00:41:34.043
Please, l didn't fucking do anything.

467
00:41:35.116 --> 00:41:36.708
What the fuck?

468
00:41:36.885 --> 00:41:40.912
What the fuck?
This is such fucking bullshit.

469
00:41:41.089 --> 00:41:42.579
What the fuck is this?

470
00:41:42.757 --> 00:41:44.588
What? No! No, please don't--!

471
00:41:44.759 --> 00:41:46.886
What the--?
No, no, fucking don't you-- No, no!

472
00:41:47.262 --> 00:41:49.730
Oh, my God, no, no!
Oh, my fucking God!

473
00:41:49.898 --> 00:41:51.866
Oh, my God! No, no, no, no!

474
00:41:52.033 --> 00:41:54.297
Oh, please. What the fuck?

475
00:41:54.469 --> 00:41:56.869
No, no, no, no, fuck! No!

476
00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:08.811
Fuck! Oh, fuck!

477
00:42:41.383 --> 00:42:42.611
You.

478
00:42:48.123 --> 00:42:49.886
Why?

479
00:42:53.061 --> 00:42:56.929
l always wanted to be a surgeon...

480
00:42:57.532 --> 00:43:00.330
...but the boards wouldn't pass me.

481
00:43:01.503 --> 00:43:02.800
Can you guess why?

482
00:43:13.548 --> 00:43:15.038
You see?

483
00:43:16.685 --> 00:43:18.915
So l went into business...

484
00:43:19.087 --> 00:43:21.749
...but business is so boring.

485
00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:26.517
You buy things, you sell them.
You make money, you spend money.

486
00:43:26.695 --> 00:43:28.424
What kind of life is that?

487
00:43:29.130 --> 00:43:31.394
A surgeon...

488
00:43:31.566 --> 00:43:35.297
...he holds the very essence
of life in his hands.

489
00:43:35.637 --> 00:43:37.195
Your life.

490
00:43:37.372 --> 00:43:39.840
He touches it.

491
00:43:41.343 --> 00:43:43.834
He has a relationship with it.

492
00:43:44.212 --> 00:43:46.703
He's part of it.

493
00:43:49.317 --> 00:43:52.115
Please, please.
Just let me go, please.

494
00:43:52.287 --> 00:43:54.847
You want to go?

495
00:43:55.357 --> 00:43:57.848
ls that what you want?

496
00:44:16.911 --> 00:44:19.345
Oh, my God!

497
00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:27.854
Fuck! Oh, fuck!

498
00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:40.591
You are free to go.

499
00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:08.852
Oh, fuck. No!

500
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:12.090
No. No, fuck. No, fuck--

501
00:45:13.134 --> 00:45:15.796
Please, l have money.
I’ll fucking pay you.

502
00:45:15.970 --> 00:45:17.835
Ten times, two times,
whatever you want--

503
00:45:18.006 --> 00:45:19.405
-Pay me?
-Yes.

504
00:45:19.566 --> 00:45:21.056
No one is paying me.

505
00:45:21.234 --> 00:45:24.138
In fact, l am the one paying them!

506
00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:38.223
Relax. Relax, bro.

507
00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:40.127
Oh, shit.

508
00:45:56.177 --> 00:45:58.407
-Two thirty-seven, please.
-Two three seven.

509
00:45:59.013 --> 00:46:00.241
Didn't you check out?

510
00:46:01.549 --> 00:46:02.811
No, not yet.

511
00:46:03.218 --> 00:46:04.708
Not yet.

512
00:46:04.886 --> 00:46:08.583
-This your bag?
-Yeah.

513
00:46:08.756 --> 00:46:11.350
The maid brought it here.
You're checked out.

514
00:46:11.659 --> 00:46:13.251
-l didn't check out.
-Lt says.

515
00:46:13.428 --> 00:46:15.089
Lt happened this morning.

516
00:46:15.263 --> 00:46:17.390
This is bullshit.
Did somebody leave a note?

517
00:46:17.565 --> 00:46:19.624
Because l didn't
fucking check out, dude.

518
00:46:20.134 --> 00:46:23.365
No, man, just this bag.
If it's a mistake--

519
00:46:23.538 --> 00:46:26.098
Yeah, it's definitely a mistake.
We need a fucking room.

520
00:46:26.274 --> 00:46:29.641
Chill out, man. You're on vacation.

521
00:46:31.212 --> 00:46:32.839
Two three seven.

522
00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:39.642
Hey, was there a Japanese girl
waiting in the lobby for somebody?

523
00:46:39.821 --> 00:46:42.915
No, think they left this morning.

524
00:46:43.091 --> 00:46:44.581
Yeah.

525
00:46:47.395 --> 00:46:49.158
I’m sorry, dude.

526
00:46:56.905 --> 00:46:59.305
Oh, I’m sorry. Excuse me.

527
00:47:00.475 --> 00:47:03.376
It's okay. We are going to the spa.

528
00:47:03.545 --> 00:47:05.536
You will join us?

529
00:47:10.351 --> 00:47:12.319
You should come.

530
00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:20.985
Hey, Josh, call me
soon as you get this, man.

531
00:47:21.162 --> 00:47:23.392
l got locked in that club.
Lt was retarded, dude.

532
00:47:23.565 --> 00:47:25.192
I’m at the hostel.

533
00:47:28.236 --> 00:47:29.726
Svetlana!

534
00:47:31.606 --> 00:47:33.540
Svetlana!

535
00:48:04.238 --> 00:48:05.466
Hey!

536
00:48:11.613 --> 00:48:12.807
You little fucker.

537
00:48:29.998 --> 00:48:31.363
Jesus.

538
00:48:31.532 --> 00:48:33.261
Wait at hostel for your friends.

539
00:48:33.434 --> 00:48:35.925
They will look for you there
no matter what.

540
00:48:36.104 --> 00:48:40.370
Yeah, l know. But, see, my friend
Josh is the kind of guy who--

541
00:48:40.541 --> 00:48:44.341
He just wouldn't check out without
so much as leaving a note, you know.

542
00:48:45.213 --> 00:48:47.113
He's the responsible one.

543
00:48:47.281 --> 00:48:50.273
Yeah, but maybe he worried
his belongings get stolen...

544
00:48:50.451 --> 00:48:52.476
...so he take them when he go out.

545
00:48:52.654 --> 00:48:55.179
Someone misplace if he leaves note.

546
00:48:55.823 --> 00:48:57.256
Lt is not uncommon.

547
00:49:00.061 --> 00:49:02.586
Yeah, well, is there
anything else that l can do?

548
00:49:03.931 --> 00:49:06.559
There's nothing right now.

549
00:49:06.968 --> 00:49:08.196
We have his picture...

550
00:49:08.369 --> 00:49:11.600
...if we see him, or he is picked up,
or something happen...

551
00:49:11.773 --> 00:49:14.537
...we contact you at hostel, yeah?

552
00:49:14.709 --> 00:49:16.176
Okay.

553
00:49:18.179 --> 00:49:19.646
Where are you from?

554
00:49:20.548 --> 00:49:21.810
California.

555
00:49:23.751 --> 00:49:26.413
You are so far from home.

556
00:50:49.937 --> 00:50:52.929
Paxton. Come, have a drink.

557
00:50:56.077 --> 00:50:58.841
Hello, Mr. American.

558
00:51:01.082 --> 00:51:03.482
-Did you get my messages?
-Which one?

559
00:51:03.918 --> 00:51:05.180
There are so many.

560
00:51:05.353 --> 00:51:08.049
l call you back, but child answer.

561
00:51:08.556 --> 00:51:09.989
Yeah, l know.

562
00:51:10.158 --> 00:51:11.716
Have you seen Josh?

563
00:51:16.697 --> 00:51:18.392
Ln English, please.

564
00:51:19.534 --> 00:51:21.263
He is with your friend...

565
00:51:21.435 --> 00:51:23.300
...the King of the Swing.

566
00:51:23.905 --> 00:51:26.897
-He's with Oli.
-Why you leave last night?

567
00:51:27.441 --> 00:51:31.343
Did you not listen to my messages?
l got locked in a storage room.

568
00:51:31.512 --> 00:51:34.845
l don't know,
l got sick and passed out.

569
00:51:38.219 --> 00:51:41.154
-What?
-She said you met another girl.

570
00:51:41.322 --> 00:51:43.187
Where are my friends?

571
00:51:49.197 --> 00:51:51.222
The art show.

572
00:51:52.433 --> 00:51:54.993
-You mean like a museum?
-No, no, no.

573
00:51:55.837 --> 00:52:01.469
Not museum.
They went-- How you say, for artist?

574
00:52:01.642 --> 00:52:04.668
-Exhibit.
-Exhibit for artist.

575
00:52:04.846 --> 00:52:06.336
No, that doesn't make any sense.

576
00:52:06.514 --> 00:52:08.175
Why? What is wrong?

577
00:52:08.349 --> 00:52:11.443
Well, they didn't leave a note.
They didn't call or do anything.

578
00:52:11.719 --> 00:52:13.084
They tell us to tell you.

579
00:52:13.254 --> 00:52:15.222
Yeah, but l tried calling them all day.

580
00:52:15.389 --> 00:52:18.483
Yes, but their phone, the battery die
and they do not have--

581
00:52:18.659 --> 00:52:20.684
How you say, for electricity?

582
00:52:20.862 --> 00:52:23.831
Converter. Okay, whatever,
where is this art show...

583
00:52:23.998 --> 00:52:25.625

-Have a drink.
-l don't want a drink.

585
00:52:27.802 --> 00:52:29.963
All right? l wanna see some art.

586
00:52:30.137 --> 00:52:32.799
Okay? So can we go?

587
00:52:45.553 --> 00:52:46.815
You're not going?

588

I’ve seen this show.

589
00:52:56.030 --> 00:52:58.021
You want gum?

590
00:52:58.733 --> 00:53:00.098
No.

591
00:53:22.290 --> 00:53:23.848
Too bad for you.

Are you coming or what?

594
00:54:34.562 --> 00:54:37.497
Excuse me. Excuse me.

Be careful.

597
00:54:43.971 --> 00:54:45.302
Why is that?

598
00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:50.238
You could spend all your money...

599
00:54:50.644 --> 00:54:52.305
...in there.

600
00:55:27.581 --> 00:55:28.809

Well, goddamn, motherfucker,

649
01:14:01.794 --> 01:14:04.092
What did you go for, a local?

650
01:14:04.264 --> 01:14:05.492
What, European?

651
01:14:07.333 --> 01:14:09.096

They told me they lined up
something special.

655
01:14:18.178 --> 01:14:20.271
I’ve been waiting almost a week
for this shit.

656
01:14:20.446 --> 01:14:22.209
For 50 grand,
she better be worth it.

657
01:14:22.382 --> 01:14:24.612
But it's supposed to be
a real rush, right?

I’ve been all over the world.
You know, I’ve been everywhere.

661
01:14:35.128 --> 01:14:37.961
And the bottom line is,
pussy's pussy.

662
01:14:38.464 --> 01:14:42.230
You know, every strip club,
every whorehouse, every....

663
01:14:42.402 --> 01:14:44.063
It's all the same shit.

664
01:14:44.237 --> 01:14:48.264
l just fucked a girl two days ago, l don't
even remember the color of her tits.

665
01:14:48.608 --> 01:14:54.171
But this, this is something
you never forget, right?

666
01:14:55.949 --> 01:14:56.938
Right?

667
01:14:58.785 --> 01:15:00.582
-Never.
-Never, right.

668
01:15:01.621 --> 01:15:04.249

Come on, let me see yours.
We're all in the same club.

01:15:12.432 --> 01:15:13.922
I’ll be out in a second, guy.

672
01:15:14.901 --> 01:15:18.302
Can l ask you something personal?
Do you mind?

673
01:15:19.672 --> 01:15:20.900
How'd you do it?

674
01:15:22.475 --> 01:15:23.772
Did you do it real slow...

675
01:15:24.377 --> 01:15:27.005
...or did you just get it over with
right away?

676
01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:28.943
That's why l asked for
the fucking gun.

677
01:15:29.115 --> 01:15:31.208
Because l just wanted
to fucking do it quick.

678
01:15:31.384 --> 01:15:32.976
l just wanted to get it over with.

679
01:15:33.152 --> 01:15:35.746
But now I’m thinking maybe
l wanna feel it, you know?

680
01:15:35.922 --> 01:15:37.549
l wanna fucking feel that shit.

681
01:15:37.724 --> 01:15:41.057
So l don't know what to-- I’m thinking--
What do you think l should do?

682
01:15:44.397 --> 01:15:46.194
-Make it quick.
-Make it quick.

683
01:15:46.366 --> 01:15:48.334
Yes.

684
01:15:49.002 --> 01:15:50.936
Yeah, that's-- No, fuck that shit.

685
01:15:51.104 --> 01:15:54.369
Fuck this, too fucking American, dude.
I’m going fucking old school.

686
01:15:54.540 --> 01:15:56.235
Who wants this, motherfucker?

687
01:15:56.409 --> 01:15:59.105
Who wants this shit?
Come on, motherfucker.

01:17:36.342 --> 01:17:37.673
What are you, fucking deaf?

692

Kana.

693
01:17:55.461 --> 01:17:58.521
-Oh, my God.
-What do you want me to do, Kana?

694
01:18:01.134 --> 01:18:05.730
What? l don't understand
what you're saying. What?

695
01:18:11.911 --> 01:18:18.111
Fuck. I’m sorry, I’m sorry.
Hold still. Hold still.

696
01:18:18.284 --> 01:18:22.584
-Fuck. Oh, God. God.

698
01:18:24.924 --> 01:18:28.291
I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

699
01:18:45.745 --> 01:18:47.042
Fuck!

700
01:18:47.213 --> 01:18:48.646
Fuck!

701
01:18:52.418 --> 01:18:54.147
Fuck!

702
01:20:10.530 --> 01:20:12.794
We're gonna get the fuck
out of here, Kana.

703
01:20:36.856 --> 01:20:39.416
Move this fucking truck!

704
01:22:42.481 --> 01:22:43.709
Fuck.

705
01:22:56.462 --> 01:22:57.952
We're almost there.

706
01:23:03.369 --> 01:23:04.597
Oh, my God.

707
01:23:08.007 --> 01:23:09.269
Oh, no.

708
01:23:13.813 --> 01:23:15.041
Fuck.

709
01:24:47.339 --> 01:24:49.830
Kana.

710
01:24:51.343 --> 01:24:53.140
Kana.

711
01:25:02.721 --> 01:25:04.689
Come here.

712
01:25:13.766 --> 01:25:16.599
No. No, Kana. Kana.

713
01:25:20.940 --> 01:25:22.464
No, Kana.

714
01:26:17.596 --> 01:26:21.726
No, thank you.
l prefer to use my hands.

715
01:26:22.101 --> 01:26:25.559
l believe people have lost
their relationship with food.

716
01:26:25.738 --> 01:26:26.762
They do not think:

717
01:26:26.939 --> 01:26:30.204
''This is something who gave its life
so l would not go hungry.''

718
01:26:30.376 --> 01:26:34.972
l like to have a connection
with something that died for me.

719
01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:27.495
l get a lot of money for you...

720
01:33:27.672 --> 01:33:30.800
...and that make you <i>my bitch</i>.
