00:56:09.303 --> 00:56:11.873
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

1043
00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:14.175
So the Bronx, huh?

1044
00:56:14.308 --> 00:56:16.277
[rattling]
Brooklyn, all right?

1045
00:56:16.409 --> 00:56:18.145
East New York all day.

1046
00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:20.081
I'm from Bushwick.

1047
00:56:20.214 --> 00:56:22.449
Really? Mm-hmm.

1048
00:56:22.583 --> 00:56:24.952
Um, me and my dad, we
used to go to this...

1049
00:56:25.086 --> 00:56:27.521
This pizza spot down on
Knickerbocker and Greene.

1050
00:56:27.655 --> 00:56:30.423
Tony's Pizza? Wow. [chuckles]

1051
00:56:30.558 --> 00:56:32.159
[clunking] [Elena
grunts, exhales]

1052
00:56:34.795 --> 00:56:37.198
So, uh, tell me
about him, your pops.

1053
00:56:37.331 --> 00:56:38.465
What... What was he like?

1054
00:56:38.599 --> 00:56:42.402
He was a... He was a
cabbie for 40 years.

1055
00:56:42.536 --> 00:56:45.206
Smartest guy you ever met.

1056
00:56:45.339 --> 00:56:47.474
He could talk to
you about anything.

1057
00:56:47.608 --> 00:56:50.211
History, science, cricket.

1058
00:56:50.344 --> 00:56:52.113
Cricket? [both chuckle]

1059
00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:55.349
And he ain't never even
go to college either.

1060
00:56:55.482 --> 00:56:57.385
He used to always say,

1061
00:56:57.518 --> 00:57:00.922
"If you keep your eyes
and your ears open,

1062
00:57:01.055 --> 00:57:03.691
life will show you
everything you need to know."

1063
00:57:05.893 --> 00:57:08.329
So that's why you said
yes to all of this.

1064
00:57:09.163 --> 00:57:11.632
I figured if he is
somewhere watching,

1065
00:57:11.766 --> 00:57:15.670
then seeing his daughter do
something crazy like this

1066
00:57:16.370 --> 00:57:18.471
would definitely make him proud.

1067
00:57:28.149 --> 00:57:30.885
You really think this
key thing's in Peru?

1068
00:57:31.018 --> 00:57:32.219
I... I think so.

1069
00:57:32.353 --> 00:57:33.988
The evidence lines up.

1070
00:57:35.756 --> 00:57:38.759
Well, if it is, and we
get our hands on it,

1071
00:57:38.893 --> 00:57:40.328
then we gotta destroy it.

1072
00:57:40.460 --> 00:57:42.229
What?

1073
00:57:42.363 --> 00:57:45.533
They can't unite the
key without both pieces.

1074
00:57:45.666 --> 00:57:49.503
No key, no Unicron, no
Earth getting eaten.

1075
00:57:52.873 --> 00:57:55.042
Yeah, but then they
can't get home.

1076
00:57:56.444 --> 00:57:58.079
We gotta think about us.

1077
00:58:01.949 --> 00:58:03.985
Look, all you gotta
do is find it.

1078
00:58:04.118 --> 00:58:06.187
And I'll take care of the rest.

1079
00:58:08.155 --> 00:58:10.157
[rumbling]

1080
00:58:10.291 --> 00:58:14.395
[Arcee] Do you think an Energon
infusion could bring him back?

1081
00:58:14.528 --> 00:58:15.763
[Prime] Perhaps.

1082
00:58:16.597 --> 00:58:19.233
If we could get him
back to Cybertron.

1083
00:58:20.901 --> 00:58:24.271
I never should have taken
us so far from home.

1084
00:58:32.546 --> 00:58:35.583
[engine roaring]

1085
00:58:36.350 --> 00:58:40.054
[sputtering]

1086

[tires screeching]

1091
00:59:06.213 --> 00:59:08.682
Wow! Wheeljack needs to
fix that power steering.

1092
00:59:08.816 --> 00:59:11.552
[mechanical whirring]

1093
00:59:11.685 --> 00:59:12.965
[Hispanic accent]
Sorry I'm late.

1094
00:59:13.054 --> 00:59:14.822
I was taking in a
harmonious moment

1095
00:59:14.955 --> 00:59:18.659
between a serene butterfly
and an unruffled caterpillar.

1096
00:59:18.793 --> 00:59:20.261
Such tranquility.

1097
00:59:20.394 --> 00:59:23.898
Yo-ho-ho. <i>Oye, papo,</i>
where you from? Cybertron.

1098
00:59:24.031 --> 00:59:26.367
So where'd you get that
accent? Accent? What accent?

1099
00:59:26.501 --> 00:59:28.669
You know what I'm saying?
I'm just saying it's cool.

1100
00:59:28.803 --> 00:59:31.272
I was about to be like, <i>"¿Yo,
mira, papi, de dónde eres?"</i>

1101
00:59:31.405 --> 00:59:35.209
<i>Pero</i> I didn't want to assume
that you speak Spanish too,

1102
00:59:35.342 --> 00:59:36.577
because then... Right?

1103
00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:39.246
Mmm. A little racist, <i>hermano.</i>

1104
00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:41.516
I'm not trying to
be, you know... Yo.

1105
00:59:41.649 --> 00:59:44.718
But anyway... The
mission. Follow me.

1106
00:59:44.852 --> 00:59:47.088
But he's a robot, like, so,

1107
00:59:47.788 --> 00:59:49.590
how's that racist?

1108
00:59:51.258 --> 00:59:52.860
[Airazor screeches]

1109
00:59:52.993 --> 00:59:54.862
[Wheeljack] Okay, you
guys, check this out.

1110
00:59:54.995 --> 00:59:58.199
The coordinates you gave me
correspond to an old church.

1111
00:59:58.332 --> 00:59:59.300
Take a look.

1112
00:59:59.433 --> 01:00:01.536
[whirring, chittering]

1113
01:00:01.669 --> 01:00:05.239
That's Santo Domingo. The Spanish
built it on top of an old Inca temple.

1114
01:00:05.372 --> 01:00:09.210
<i>Correcto.</i> I picked up some residual
energy readings around the courtyard,

1115
01:00:09.343 --> 01:00:11.912
so I'm guessing the
key's somewhere close by.

1116
01:00:12.046 --> 01:00:14.348
But we may have some
trouble getting there.

1117
01:00:14.482 --> 01:00:15.816
Inti Raymi.

1118
01:00:15.950 --> 01:00:18.419
It's a festival that
shuts down the whole city.

1119
01:00:18.553 --> 01:00:20.988
Guess it's a night
mission then. [Prime] No.

1120
01:00:21.122 --> 01:00:23.257
Scourge could already be here.

1121
01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:26.994
We must retrieve the
other half before he does.

1122
01:00:28.963 --> 01:00:31.198
Me and Elena will do it. Hmm?

1123
01:00:31.332 --> 01:00:33.367
Y'all would never
make it two blocks.

1124
01:00:33.502 --> 01:00:36.179
There's human security all around
the church. You'll never get through.

1125
01:00:36.203 --> 01:00:39.006
Then we'll have to take
a play out of your book.

1126
01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:41.208
We'll hide in plain sight.

1127
01:00:41.342 --> 01:00:43.677
We'll blend in with the parade.

1128
01:00:43.811 --> 01:00:46.647
It is not a bad idea.

1129
01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:49.551
We will keep an eye
out for the Terrorcons.

1130
01:00:49.683 --> 01:00:53.320
On first sign of
trouble, we are going in.

1131
01:00:53.454 --> 01:00:54.855
Yo, Noah, think fast.

1132
01:00:54.989 --> 01:00:57.224
[mechanical whirring]

1133
01:01:01.028 --> 01:01:03.430
And if you need
help, just holler.

1134
01:01:04.965 --> 01:01:07.801
[crowd cheering]

1135
01:01:07.935 --> 01:01:10.271
[up-tempo music playing]

1136
01:01:18.846 --> 01:01:21.182
[Prime hisses] I
am in position.

1137
01:01:21.315 --> 01:01:23.150
[Mirage] All right,
coast is clear.

1138
01:01:23.284 --> 01:01:26.187
<i>Noah, Elena, it's go time.</i>

1139
01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:29.190
<i>Blend in. Act natural.</i>

1140
01:01:30.491 --> 01:01:32.226
[crowd applauding]

1141
01:01:36.531 --> 01:01:38.265
[crowd cheering]

1142
01:02:00.254 --> 01:02:01.488
[chittering]

1143
01:02:01.623 --> 01:02:04.659
[Nightbird] Autobots must
be using their new pets

1144
01:02:04.825 --> 01:02:06.760
to reach the temple.

1145
01:02:06.894 --> 01:02:08.996
Lovely.

1146
01:02:09.129 --> 01:02:12.032
They're doing our work for us.

1147
01:02:12.166 --> 01:02:14.301
Go fetch.

1148
01:02:18.906 --> 01:02:21.141
[Noah] The key's gotta
be in here somewhere.

1149
01:02:21.742 --> 01:02:22.977
Yeah.

1150
01:02:23.978 --> 01:02:26.814
[distant cheering, drumming]

1151
01:02:36.691 --> 01:02:39.126
That stonework is 17th century.

1152
01:02:39.260 --> 01:02:42.530
What we're looking
for is something

1153
01:02:43.397 --> 01:02:46.267
much, much older.

1154
01:02:54.375 --> 01:02:57.278
What is it? It's the
same insignia on Airazor.

1155
01:02:58.045 --> 01:02:59.780
But it's not lined up right.

1156
01:02:59.913 --> 01:03:02.517
[cheering]

1157
01:03:02.651 --> 01:03:04.118
Wait, you see that?

1158
01:03:04.251 --> 01:03:09.356
I think there's something
under here. [grunts]

1159
01:03:09.490 --> 01:03:12.126
[rumbling]

1160
01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:14.862
There's another one.

1161
01:03:18.966 --> 01:03:20.535
There is.

1162
01:03:24.872 --> 01:03:27.207
[rumbling]

1163
01:03:29.644 --> 01:03:30.911
Now what?

1164
01:03:32.046 --> 01:03:34.481
[Elena] I thought it
would've... [shouts]

1165
01:03:47.861 --> 01:03:50.297
That's some Indiana
Jones-type shit.

1166
01:03:51.666 --> 01:03:53.400
You sure about this?

1167
01:03:53.934 --> 01:03:55.169
No.

1168
01:04:03.844 --> 01:04:05.913
[Prime buzzes] Any
sign of Scourge?

1169
01:04:06.046 --> 01:04:07.381
Nope, all clear here.

1170
01:04:07.515 --> 01:04:08.817
[Mirage] Uh, yeah.

1171
01:04:08.949 --> 01:04:10.761
It's just groupies over
here. [camera shutter clicks]

1172
01:04:10.785 --> 01:04:12.953
[Prime] Stay on task, Mirage.

1173
01:04:13.087 --> 01:04:16.190
Prime, you gotta learn
how to relax, my man.

1174
01:04:17.659 --> 01:04:19.393
[chittering]

1175
01:04:20.662 --> 01:04:23.531
[both breathing heavily]

1176
01:04:23.665 --> 01:04:24.898
Ah.

1177
01:04:38.479 --> 01:04:42.916
You know, we must be the first people
to walk here in half a millennium.

1178
01:04:44.351 --> 01:04:46.821
[glove buzzes] [Mirage]
<i>Yo, Sonic. You dead yet?</i>

1179

[glove buzzing]

1180
01:04:48.656 --> 01:04:49.758
No.

1181
01:04:50.491 --> 01:04:52.660
Wait, did you just
call me Sonic?

1182
01:04:52.794 --> 01:04:54.328
I think that's a temple.

1183
01:05:00.869 --> 01:05:02.604
What are we looking for?

1184
01:05:02.737 --> 01:05:04.873
[Elena] You see the
symbols on that temple?

1185
01:05:05.005 --> 01:05:06.775
They match the ones
in the courtyard.

1186
01:05:06.907 --> 01:05:08.475
I think it's up there.

1187
01:05:20.087 --> 01:05:22.456
I think we found what
we came here for.

1188
01:05:22.590 --> 01:05:24.826
[quiet growling]

1189
01:05:24.992 --> 01:05:26.592
I always wondered what
it would feel like

1190
01:05:26.694 --> 01:05:29.664
to be there when artifacts
were actually found.

1191
01:05:32.299 --> 01:05:35.169
All right. Now come on, push.

1192
01:05:37.539 --> 01:05:39.440
[grunting]

1193
01:05:42.844 --> 01:05:44.846
Are you even pushing?

1194
01:05:44.978 --> 01:05:46.980
[grunts] Yeah, I'm pushing.

1195
01:05:47.114 --> 01:05:48.482
[both grunting]

1196
01:05:49.983 --> 01:05:51.853
[exclaims, grunts]

1197
01:05:51.985 --> 01:05:53.220
[coughs]

1198
01:05:58.292 --> 01:06:00.528
Wait, what? Just...
Just let me think.

1199
01:06:00.662 --> 01:06:02.329
Oh, no, no. Where is it?

1200
01:06:02.463 --> 01:06:07.000
Sometimes there's, like, a...
like a false bottom or something.

1201
01:06:10.170 --> 01:06:11.438
[blows] Look.

1202
01:06:11.573 --> 01:06:14.374
I think I found something.
You see these symbols?

1203
01:06:14.509 --> 01:06:17.846
I've seen markings like this...
the Airazor statue at my museum.

1204
01:06:17.978 --> 01:06:19.948
They're new.

1205
01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:22.249
They're not on
the Transwarp Key.

1206
01:06:22.382 --> 01:06:24.284
There's two of them.

1207
01:06:26.688 --> 01:06:28.355
[rubble thudding]

1208
01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:34.394
[whispering] Mirage?

1209
01:06:38.432 --> 01:06:41.435
Let's keep moving.
Just give me a second.

1210
01:06:45.673 --> 01:06:46.941
Run! [screams]

1211
01:06:47.074 --> 01:06:49.009
[whimpers]

1212
01:06:50.645 --> 01:06:52.212
[both shouting]

1213
01:06:52.346 --> 01:06:54.516

1214
01:06:54.649 --> 01:06:56.149
Go, go, go, go, go!

1215
01:06:56.283 --> 01:06:58.085
Mirage! We got trouble!

1216
01:06:58.218 --> 01:07:01.255
<i>One of those things is down
here! Where are you guys?</i>

1217
01:07:01.388 --> 01:07:03.490
[Mirage] Hang tight!
I'm on the way.

1218
01:07:03.625 --> 01:07:04.759
[tires screech]

1219
01:07:06.059 --> 01:07:07.394
[Scourge] <i>The
Autobots are moving.</i>

1220
01:07:07.529 --> 01:07:10.197
They must have found the key.

1221
01:07:14.434 --> 01:07:15.904
[Elena shouts, grunts]

1222
01:07:16.036 --> 01:07:18.472

[grunting]

1224
01:07:21.441 --> 01:07:22.744
Come on!

1225
01:07:24.177 --> 01:07:25.547
Airazor, where are the humans?

1226
01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:28.683
They're underground,
heading towards the jungle.

1227
01:07:29.684 --> 01:07:31.184
[engine accelerates]

1228
01:07:39.661 --> 01:07:40.762

[tires screech]

1231
01:07:45.867 --> 01:07:48.368
[Mirage] Aw, man,
they're tailing us!

1232
01:07:50.805 --> 01:07:52.439
[breathing heavily]

1233
01:07:54.074 --> 01:07:55.309
[chittering]

1234
01:07:57.845 --> 01:07:59.948
Do something! What
do you want me to do?

1235
01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:01.281
[snarls] [glove fires]

1238
01:08:07.689 --> 01:08:09.657
You had a gun this whole time?

1239
01:08:09.791 --> 01:08:11.826
[engine revving]

[Mirage] <i>Prime, what
the hell are you doing?</i>

1243
01:08:29.877 --> 01:08:32.814
I'm going to take
back Scourge's key

1244
01:08:32.947 --> 01:08:36.084
and then take off his head.

1245
01:08:36.216 --> 01:08:38.285
[Scourge growling]

1246
01:08:47.595 --> 01:08:50.430
[Mirage] Guys! [shouts] I
could use a little help!

1247
01:08:50.565 --> 01:08:52.834
Did someone call for backup?

1248
01:09:01.109 --> 01:09:02.710
Brake, brake, brake!
[Wheeljack] What?

1249
01:09:02.844 --> 01:09:04.946
Brake!

1250
01:09:05.079 --> 01:09:08.315
[no audible dialogue]

1251
01:09:10.818 --> 01:09:12.252
[tires screech]

1252
01:09:12.386 --> 01:09:15.322
Yay! [laughing]

1253
01:09:16.256 --> 01:09:18.492
[Prime] This is for Bee!

1254
01:09:30.237 --> 01:09:31.873
[Battletrap] Come here.

1255
01:09:32.006 --> 01:09:33.440
[tires screech] Hold on!

1256
01:09:34.274 --> 01:09:36.343

[grunting]

1260
01:09:53.326 --> 01:09:55.797
I love your fire, Prime.

1261
01:09:55.930 --> 01:09:59.667
But you're going to die
on this speck of dust.

1262
01:09:59.801 --> 01:10:03.771
I can think of no better
place to bury you.

1263
01:10:03.905 --> 01:10:06.306
[both grunting]

01:10:08.743 --> 01:10:10.878

1268
01:10:31.532 --> 01:10:34.001
I will end you, Scourge.

[growls]

1270
01:10:35.903 --> 01:10:39.306
That is a promise.

1271
01:10:39.439 --> 01:10:41.008
[Nightbird] They're
getting away.

1272
01:10:41.142 --> 01:10:42.977
Not this time.

1273
01:10:45.079 --> 01:10:46.480
[Airazor screeches]

1274
01:10:49.817 --> 01:10:52.352
[water burbling] I hear water.

1275
01:10:56.157 --> 01:10:57.692
Where are we?

1276
01:10:59.392 --> 01:11:01.929
[roaring, grunting]

1277
01:11:03.898 --> 01:11:04.632
What was that?

1278
01:11:04.766 --> 01:11:07.400
[roaring, grunting continues]

1279
01:11:15.275 --> 01:11:16.276

[roars]

1281
01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:20.782
Who are you?

1282
01:11:20.915 --> 01:11:22.683
And why are you
hunting for the key?

1283
01:11:22.817 --> 01:11:25.052
Yo, Donkey Kong! Stay
away from my friends!

1284
01:11:25.186 --> 01:11:28.156
Uh, Mirage? Don't worry.
Your boy's got this.

1285
01:11:28.288 --> 01:11:30.625
[roars] [Mirage squeals]

1286
01:11:30.758 --> 01:11:33.594
Stranger danger!
Stranger danger!

1287
01:11:34.228 --> 01:11:36.030
[Wheeljack] Hey, hey, hey!

1288
01:11:36.164 --> 01:11:37.364
Not so fa...

1289
01:11:38.099 --> 01:11:40.802
[roars]

1290
01:11:41.836 --> 01:11:42.603
Ay, ay, ay.

1291
01:11:42.737 --> 01:11:45.606
Hey! Over here, kitty, kitty.

1292
01:11:46.507 --> 01:11:49.309
Stand down!
[mechanical whirring]

1293
01:11:49.442 --> 01:11:51.179
[roars]

1294
01:11:51.311 --> 01:11:54.582
I won't ask a second time.

1295
01:11:56.017 --> 01:11:57.317
[grunts]

1296
01:11:59.086 --> 01:12:01.421
No! All of you, stop!

1297
01:12:04.258 --> 01:12:06.326
Airazor. Primal.

1298
01:12:06.459 --> 01:12:09.396
I thought you were
lost. All of you.

1299
01:12:09.530 --> 01:12:12.600
The others... Are they...

1300
01:12:12.733 --> 01:12:15.603
I am all that is left.

1301
01:12:16.871 --> 01:12:18.673
[exhales deeply]

1302
01:12:18.806 --> 01:12:22.210
Prime, these are
my fellow Maximals.

1303
01:12:22.342 --> 01:12:24.545
Rhinox. [snorts]

1304
01:12:24.679 --> 01:12:26.214
[Airazor] Cheetor.

1305
01:12:26.346 --> 01:12:27.849
Sorry about scaring
you, brother.

1306
01:12:27.982 --> 01:12:29.884
[Mirage] Scared?
[scoffs] Please.

1307
01:12:30.017 --> 01:12:31.519
I'm not scared. [liquid drips]

1308
01:12:31.652 --> 01:12:32.987
That's just engine
oil. [chuckles]

1309
01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:37.892
[Airazor] And our
leader, Optimus Primal.

1310
01:12:38.593 --> 01:12:40.493
Optimus Primal?

1311
01:12:40.628 --> 01:12:44.966
Named after you, the legendary
warrior of Cybertron.

1312
01:12:45.099 --> 01:12:46.433
It's an honor.

1313
01:12:47.602 --> 01:12:50.605
Airazor, I'm happy to
see you, old friend.

1314
01:12:50.738 --> 01:12:53.741
But bringing others here
was not part of our plan.

1315
01:12:53.875 --> 01:12:56.376
I fear you bring dark tidings.

1316
01:12:56.510 --> 01:12:58.613
Scourge has come to Earth.

1317
01:12:58.746 --> 01:13:00.480
He's found us.

1318
01:13:00.615 --> 01:13:02.884
And he has half of the key.

1319
01:13:03.017 --> 01:13:05.720
We must find the second
piece before he does.

1320
01:13:05.853 --> 01:13:07.655
But it wasn't in the cave.

1321
01:13:07.788 --> 01:13:10.892
It was. But we moved it
long ago to keep it safe.

1322
01:13:11.025 --> 01:13:13.460
Where is it now?

1323
01:13:16.530 --> 01:13:17.965
Come with me.

1324
01:13:26.007 --> 01:13:27.842
[Elena] That doesn't
look so good.

1325
01:13:27.975 --> 01:13:31.612
When Scourge touches
you, he leaves a mark.

1326
01:13:32.246 --> 01:13:34.481
But I'll be all right.

1327
01:13:35.182 --> 01:13:37.417
[screeches]

1328
01:13:47.094 --> 01:13:48.963
[Noah] Hey, back there
you called me Sonic.

1329
01:13:49.096 --> 01:13:51.098
Yeah. Your little
bro's got this thing

1330
01:13:51.232 --> 01:13:53.935
about using real names
over the airwaves, so...

1331
01:13:54.068 --> 01:13:55.770
Wait, you been talking
to Kris? Uh-huh.

1332
01:13:55.903 --> 01:13:59.340
[machine beeping] He gave
me this to keep tabs on you,

1333
01:13:59.472 --> 01:14:00.942
make sure I'm
keeping my promise.

1334
01:14:01.075 --> 01:14:02.410
Oh, here.

1335
01:14:02.543 --> 01:14:04.512
Next time, include
warning labels.

1336
01:14:04.645 --> 01:14:07.447
[Mirage] Nah, go
ahead, keep it.

1337
01:14:07.581 --> 01:14:09.350
I guess it does
look better on me.

1338
01:14:09.482 --> 01:14:12.253
Just don't ask what part
of my body it came from.

1339
01:14:12.386 --> 01:14:13.621
[chuckles]

1340
01:14:15.222 --> 01:14:17.091
So, who are you?

1341
01:14:17.224 --> 01:14:19.193
[Primal] We Maximals
are an advanced race

1342
01:14:19.327 --> 01:14:23.597
dedicated to the expansion of
life throughout the universe.

1343
01:14:23.731 --> 01:14:26.867
We use the Transwarp Key
to visit young worlds.

1344
01:14:27.001 --> 01:14:30.671
The Nazca Lines, the
Temple at Tikal...

1345
01:14:30.805 --> 01:14:32.440
That was you guys, right?

1346
01:14:32.573 --> 01:14:33.741
[chuckles] Not us.

1347
01:14:33.874 --> 01:14:36.177
We cannot claim credit
for human ingenuity.

1348
01:14:36.310 --> 01:14:39.780
But you had the key.
Why stay on this world?

1349
01:14:39.914 --> 01:14:42.216
When Unicron
destroyed our world,

1350
01:14:42.350 --> 01:14:46.287
we took an oath dedicated
to the preservation of life,

1351
01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:48.322
no matter the cost.

1352
01:14:48.456 --> 01:14:50.858
And Earth has been
a safe refuge.

1353
01:15:04.438 --> 01:15:06.374
[growling]

1354
01:15:06.507 --> 01:15:08.776
[laughing]

1355
01:15:19.553 --> 01:15:23.524
[speaking Peruvian language]

1356
01:15:23.657 --> 01:15:25.559
[speaks Peruvian language]

1357
01:15:27.762 --> 01:15:29.797
[speaks Peruvian language]

1358
01:15:29.930 --> 01:15:32.066
[Primal] This is Amaru.

1359
01:15:32.199 --> 01:15:35.169
He and his family are the
last descendants of a tribe

1360
01:15:35.302 --> 01:15:38.072
that has watched over us
for hundreds of years.

1361
01:15:38.205 --> 01:15:43.110
When we arrived, they
shared their world with us.

1362
01:15:43.244 --> 01:15:45.679
And together we
protected its people

1363
01:15:45.813 --> 01:15:48.849
and our secret.

1364
01:15:55.356 --> 01:15:57.258
You allied with humans.

1365
01:15:58.192 --> 01:15:59.927
[Primal] We did.

1366
01:16:00.928 --> 01:16:03.230
[Prime] If you
give us this key,

1367
01:16:03.364 --> 01:16:07.368
tomorrow I will light the
beacon and bring Scourge to us.

1368
01:16:07.502 --> 01:16:11.972
The Maximals have already sacrificed
one home to protect the universe.

1369
01:16:12.106 --> 01:16:14.509
I won't risk losing another.

1370
01:16:14.642 --> 01:16:17.578
As a leader, I know
you understand.

1371
01:16:19.847 --> 01:16:21.715
[electrical humming]

1372
01:16:42.269 --> 01:16:45.906
He is not the Optimus
Prime I imagined.

1373
01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:49.110
Well, he has lost so much.

1374
01:16:49.243 --> 01:16:50.911
Many more will perish

1375
01:16:51.045 --> 01:16:54.048
if the key falls
into the wrong hands.

1376
01:16:54.181 --> 01:16:57.885
If you had another
chance to save our home,

1377
01:16:58.018 --> 01:17:00.054
would you act any differently?

1378
01:17:01.188 --> 01:17:03.891
[growls quietly]

1379
01:17:04.024 --> 01:17:07.261
Optimus, come. I want
to show you something.

1380
01:17:07.394 --> 01:17:10.264
[growling]

1381
01:17:12.032 --> 01:17:14.635
[Primal] Your friend
will find peace here.

1382
01:17:16.003 --> 01:17:18.672
This is raw Energon.

1383
01:17:18.806 --> 01:17:20.708
[Primal] The valley
is rich with it.

1384
01:17:20.841 --> 01:17:23.110
Could this revive Bee?

1385
01:17:23.244 --> 01:17:26.680
I'm sorry, but in this
state, it is inert.

1386
01:17:26.814 --> 01:17:29.216
It would take a great
power to ignite it.

1387
01:17:29.350 --> 01:17:32.386
Greater than anything
we have here.

1388
01:17:32.521 --> 01:17:34.822
[speaking Peruvian language]

1389
01:17:34.955 --> 01:17:38.125
I see that you are surprised
we entrust the key to them.

1390
01:17:38.259 --> 01:17:39.927
Yes, I am.

1391
01:17:40.060 --> 01:17:42.796
I've been amongst
them a long time now.

1392
01:17:42.930 --> 01:17:46.233
There is more to them
than meets the eye.

1393
01:17:46.367 --> 01:17:48.335
They are worth saving.

1394
01:17:59.346 --> 01:18:00.381
Hmm.

1395
01:18:18.399 --> 01:18:20.100
[animal squawking]

1396
01:18:23.037 --> 01:18:24.872
What if we didn't destroy it?

1397
01:18:26.774 --> 01:18:32.112
Maybe there's another way
to... to save both our homes.

1398
01:18:32.246 --> 01:18:35.716
Elena, I made a lot of
mistakes in my life.

1399
01:18:37.318 --> 01:18:38.953
This is different.

1400
01:18:41.155 --> 01:18:43.157
I can't fail at this.

1401
01:18:43.791 --> 01:18:45.859
I can't let my family down.

1402
01:18:45.993 --> 01:18:49.129
You're just like
him. You know that?

1403
01:18:49.263 --> 01:18:50.431
Who?

1404
01:18:50.565 --> 01:18:51.932
Optimus.

1405
01:18:53.334 --> 01:18:54.669
I'm serious.

1406
01:18:54.802 --> 01:18:58.005
He feels it too. Feels what?

1407
01:18:58.138 --> 01:19:00.140
Like a beast of burden

1408
01:19:00.274 --> 01:19:04.411
just trying to carry the weight
of the world on his shoulders.

1409
01:19:05.580 --> 01:19:09.283
You think he's some... Some
general barking orders,

1410
01:19:09.416 --> 01:19:11.352
but when I look at him,

1411
01:19:11.485 --> 01:19:14.822
all I see is a big brother
trying to protect his family.

1412
01:19:35.677 --> 01:19:37.545
[animal chittering]

1413
01:19:46.854 --> 01:19:49.089
[chittering continues]

1414
01:20:01.869 --> 01:20:04.371
[chittering continues]

1415
01:20:10.545 --> 01:20:12.012
[squawking]

1416
01:20:12.146 --> 01:20:13.814
[Elena] Are you okay?

1417
01:20:16.785 --> 01:20:19.554
[groaning]

1418
01:20:20.287 --> 01:20:21.288
Airazor?

1419
01:20:21.422 --> 01:20:24.892
I can feel Scourge!

1420
01:20:25.025 --> 01:20:27.562
He's... [distorted]
...in my mind.

1421
01:20:27.696 --> 01:20:29.631
[groaning continues]

1422
01:20:29.764 --> 01:20:32.833
[horn blowing]

1423
01:20:35.069 --> 01:20:36.870
[screeching]

1424
01:20:37.004 --> 01:20:39.907
[screams] [Prime] Run, Elena!

1425
01:20:42.476 --> 01:20:43.678
[Primal] No!

1426
01:20:43.812 --> 01:20:46.046
[screeches]

1427
01:20:47.247 --> 01:20:50.351
Airazor. [Airazor screeches]

1428
01:20:50.484 --> 01:20:51.720
[Prime] They found us.

1429
01:20:51.852 --> 01:20:55.089
Everyone, defensive positions!

1430
01:20:55.222 --> 01:20:57.592
Noah, guard the key.

1431
01:20:57.726 --> 01:21:01.261
Take Elena and find
someplace safe to hide.

1432
01:21:02.697 --> 01:21:04.465
We must protect the humans.

1433
01:21:04.599 --> 01:21:06.400
[grunting]

1434
01:21:07.267 --> 01:21:08.837
Miss me?

1435
01:21:08.969 --> 01:21:12.072
[Mirage] Noah, Elena,
get out of here!

1436
01:21:24.819 --> 01:21:26.353
[gasps]

1437
01:21:27.888 --> 01:21:29.624
We have to destroy it.

1438
01:21:31.826 --> 01:21:32.861
Noah!

1439
01:21:32.993 --> 01:21:34.629
[Prime] No!

1440
01:21:35.530 --> 01:21:37.297
Don't.

1441
01:21:39.466 --> 01:21:43.203
I know you want to
protect your people,

1442
01:21:43.337 --> 01:21:46.039
but if you destroy that key,

1443
01:21:46.173 --> 01:21:49.009
our home will be lost forever.

1444
01:21:49.143 --> 01:21:51.546
We do not have to choose.

1445
01:21:53.615 --> 01:21:56.450
[weapon humming]

1446
01:21:58.152 --> 01:22:00.220
Please, Noah.

1447
01:22:04.091 --> 01:22:06.260
[humming stops] [weapon beeps]

1448
01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:14.502
[Airazor screeches]

1449
01:22:14.636 --> 01:22:16.003
[Noah, Elena grunt]

1450
01:22:18.506 --> 01:22:20.274
Elena!

1451
01:22:24.546 --> 01:22:25.580
Go!

1452
01:22:29.551 --> 01:22:30.752
[Airazor screeches]

1453
01:22:30.885 --> 01:22:32.654
[grunting]

1454
01:22:32.787 --> 01:22:35.623
[Elena screaming]

1455
01:22:41.729 --> 01:22:43.363
[grunting continues]

1456
01:22:47.602 --> 01:22:49.136
[Primal] Elena!

1457
01:22:53.808 --> 01:22:58.078
Wait, wait. Didn't
I kill you already?

1458
01:22:58.913 --> 01:23:00.380
[roars] No!

1459
01:23:00.515 --> 01:23:03.150
I'm the Maximal that's
going to rip out your spark.

1460
01:23:03.283 --> 01:23:06.521
[laughs] We'll see about that.

1461
01:23:06.654 --> 01:23:07.622
Kill them!

1462
01:23:07.755 --> 01:23:08.823
[screeching]

1463
01:23:08.957 --> 01:23:11.325
[Primal groaning]

1464
01:23:14.629 --> 01:23:15.563
Airazor, no!

1465
01:23:15.697 --> 01:23:18.700
[distorted] I can't
hold it back...

1466
01:23:18.833 --> 01:23:20.635
[normal voice] ...much longer.

1467
01:23:20.768 --> 01:23:23.237
[groans] Fight it, Airazor.

1468
01:23:24.037 --> 01:23:26.941
Remember our oath, Primal.

1469
01:23:27.074 --> 01:23:29.511
No matter the cost.

1470
01:23:29.644 --> 01:23:33.515
[Airazor] I can't hold
it back! Airazor, no!

1471
01:23:36.183 --> 01:23:38.520
[grunting, groaning]

1472
01:23:38.653 --> 01:23:40.087
[breathing heavily]

1473
01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:42.690
[grunting, groaning continue]

1474
01:23:45.092 --> 01:23:46.528
Primal!

1475
01:23:48.830 --> 01:23:50.230
[screams]

1476
01:23:53.868 --> 01:23:56.938
It's okay. [roars]

1477
01:23:57.070 --> 01:23:58.640
[Airazor] Do it.

1478
01:24:00.909 --> 01:24:03.678
[electrical humming]

1479
01:24:07.114 --> 01:24:08.816
[humming slows]

1480
01:24:13.086 --> 01:24:14.488
[humming stops]

1481
01:24:22.530 --> 01:24:24.231
Primal.

1482
01:24:25.399 --> 01:24:27.467
No matter the cost.

1483
01:24:36.343 --> 01:24:38.278
Elena! Elena, look at me.

1484
01:24:39.346 --> 01:24:40.748
Are you okay?

1485
01:24:43.383 --> 01:24:45.218
Scourge has the key.

1486
01:25:13.180 --> 01:25:16.149
[electrical humming]

1487
01:25:29.597 --> 01:25:34.468
Awaken, almighty Unicron.
Your time has come.

1488
01:25:37.572 --> 01:25:39.540
[rumbling]

1489
01:25:49.316 --> 01:25:51.385
[rumbling continues]

1490
01:26:10.203 --> 01:26:12.674
[key ringing]

1491
01:26:14.307 --> 01:26:16.678
[key humming]

1492
01:26:16.811 --> 01:26:18.946
[crackling]

1493
01:26:22.182 --> 01:26:24.852
[rumbling]

1494
01:26:37.364 --> 01:26:40.200
I am sorry, Noah.

1495
01:26:40.333 --> 01:26:42.369
You were looking
out for your own.

1496
01:26:45.238 --> 01:26:46.974
I can't even be angry
at you for that.

1497
01:26:47.108 --> 01:26:51.746
On my home world, we believe that the
battle with darkness will continue

1498
01:26:51.879 --> 01:26:53.981
till all are one.

1499
01:26:55.415 --> 01:26:57.350
I lost sight of that.

1500
01:26:57.484 --> 01:27:01.421
You fought for yours
as I fought for mine

1501
01:27:01.556 --> 01:27:05.292
when we should have been
fighting the darkness together.

1502
01:27:08.663 --> 01:27:11.398
Well, I ain't done fighting yet.

1503
01:27:15.737 --> 01:27:17.905
All right, everybody, squad up!

1504
01:27:18.039 --> 01:27:19.439
Bring it in.

1505
01:27:19.574 --> 01:27:21.274
There's got to be a
way to stop this dude.

1506
01:27:21.408 --> 01:27:25.580
It's too late. The Transwarp
has already been activated.

1507
01:27:25.713 --> 01:27:28.381
It has more energy
than a supernova.

1508
01:27:28.516 --> 01:27:31.318
Any interruption will
ignite it like a bomb.

1509
01:27:31.451 --> 01:27:32.452
[explosion]

1510
01:27:32.587 --> 01:27:34.155
The only way to
stop this process

1511
01:27:34.287 --> 01:27:37.658
is an access code installed
long ago as a safeguard.

1512
01:27:37.792 --> 01:27:39.259
Okay, what's the code then?

1513
01:27:39.392 --> 01:27:41.863
The code was split
along with the key.

1514
01:27:41.996 --> 01:27:46.234
Sadly, the second half of
that code died with Airazor.

1515
01:27:46.366 --> 01:27:47.668
No, wait, wait,
wait. I got it.

1516
01:27:47.802 --> 01:27:49.436
The one hiding her
half of the key...

1517
01:27:49.570 --> 01:27:51.072
That had markings in it

1518
01:27:51.205 --> 01:27:53.641
just like the ones I found in
the cave where you hid yours.

1519
01:27:53.775 --> 01:27:56.878
Together, they must
complete the access code.

1520
01:27:57.011 --> 01:27:57.945
Hmm.

1521
01:27:58.079 --> 01:27:59.914
So we got a chance now, right?

1522
01:28:00.047 --> 01:28:01.348
A slim chance.

1523
01:28:01.481 --> 01:28:03.316
That is all we need

1524
01:28:03.450 --> 01:28:06.286
if you will show
us the way, Primal.

1525
01:28:08.923 --> 01:28:11.592
All right. We need
to move quickly.

1526
01:28:11.726 --> 01:28:13.795
We have a small window
before the portal opens

1527
01:28:13.928 --> 01:28:15.663
large enough for
Unicron to enter.

1528
01:28:15.797 --> 01:28:18.900
The bridge is girded
by a series of tunnels.

1529
01:28:19.033 --> 01:28:21.401
They are too small
for Maximals, but...

1530
01:28:21.536 --> 01:28:23.070
But not for humans.

1531
01:28:23.204 --> 01:28:26.874
[Optimal] If Noah and Elena
reach the central antenna,

1532
01:28:27.008 --> 01:28:29.476
they can use the
code to shut it down,

1533
01:28:29.610 --> 01:28:32.013
remove the Transwarp
Key... [humming]

1534
01:28:32.146 --> 01:28:36.017
and close the portal before
Unicron enters our atmosphere.

1535
01:28:36.150 --> 01:28:38.186
But Scourge will be
watching our every move.

1536
01:28:38.318 --> 01:28:40.788
He'll do anything to stop
us from getting the key.

1537
01:28:40.922 --> 01:28:43.157
Then we bring the fight to him.

1538
01:28:43.291 --> 01:28:45.425
Autobots and Maximals

1539
01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:47.762
will charge the bridge together

1540
01:28:47.895 --> 01:28:50.463
and lure Scourge
onto the battlefield.

1541
01:28:50.598 --> 01:28:53.366
While me and Elena sneak
in through the back way.

1542
01:28:53.501 --> 01:28:56.469
[rumbling]

1543
01:28:56.604 --> 01:28:59.006
It sounds like we're
all going to die.

1544
01:29:00.541 --> 01:29:05.179
If we are to die, then
we will die fighting

1545
01:29:05.313 --> 01:29:07.181
all as one.

1546
01:29:07.315 --> 01:29:09.884
[rumbling]

1547
01:29:19.459 --> 01:29:23.531
This world is yours, master.

1548
01:29:24.165 --> 01:29:26.000
Scourge,

1549
01:29:26.133 --> 01:29:27.602
they're back.

1550
01:29:32.974 --> 01:29:36.677
[growls] Prime.

1551
01:29:37.879 --> 01:29:42.049
Protect the key. Don't let
them get to the bridge.

1552
01:29:43.416 --> 01:29:44.886
[screeches]

1553
01:29:51.893 --> 01:29:53.460
[shrieks]

1554
01:29:54.195 --> 01:29:55.997
[growls]

1555
01:29:58.398 --> 01:30:00.467
[grunts]

1556
01:30:02.570 --> 01:30:03.905
Maximals!

1557
01:30:04.038 --> 01:30:05.573
Autobots!

1558
01:30:05.706 --> 01:30:07.608
[both] Roll out!

1559
01:30:18.451 --> 01:30:21.555
Rhinox, Cheetor, maximize!

1560
01:30:21.689 --> 01:30:25.660
[mechanical whirring]

1561
01:30:29.597 --> 01:30:31.498
[roaring]

1562
01:30:45.079 --> 01:30:46.959
[Noah] At least the foot
soldiers took the bait.

1563
01:30:47.048 --> 01:30:49.208
[Elena] Yeah, but Scourge
didn't. He's guarding the key.

1564
01:30:49.283 --> 01:30:53.287
All right. [groans] This should lead to
the bottom of the Transwarp control panel.

1565
01:30:53.421 --> 01:30:56.791
Get the key, get the hell out
of there. What are you gonna do?

1566
