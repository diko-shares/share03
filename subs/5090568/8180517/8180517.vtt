Sync and fixed by Neeboo

2
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.960
There's a legend that precedes
the dawn of our civilization.

3
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.580
A vile god, so large and so powerful

4
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.480
that it consumed entire planets as fuel.

5
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.080
Few believed such a thing could
be true until the day we saw Unicron

6
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.880
with our own eyes.

7
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:58.500
But he didn't just come for our planet,
he wanted our greatest technology.

8
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.700
The Transwarp Key.

9
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.900
And he sent his most
powerful henchmen to collect it.

10
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.700
Scourge.

11
00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.720
More enemies are landing.
We won't be safe for long.

12
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.820
Do we have the key?

13
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.720
You must take it.

14
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.720
Keep it hidden.

15
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.720
So that it never falls
into the hands of Unicron.

16
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.720
But, Ape Link, we can fight.

17
00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.220
No. Protecting our
transwarp key is all that matters.

18
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.720
Go! Use it to escape.

19
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.820
What will you do?

20
00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.220
I'll hold him off.

21
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.720
I buy you some time.

22
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.720
Then I'm staying with you.

23
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.380
This is my fight. Listen...

24
00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.020
If Unicron were to get the key, he could
open a portal through time and space 

25
00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.240
with no end to the
worlds he could destroy.

26
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.520
It is now your time
to lead the Maximals,

27
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.640
Optimus Primal.

28
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.660
So you're this planet's great warrior.

29
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.880
You have such a beautiful world.

30
00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.480
Filled with an abundance of life.

31
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.360
Savory.

32
00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.280
My master grows hungry. 

33
00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:36.280
Give me the Transwarp Key
and he will spare your home.

34
00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.280
We'd rather die
than let him breach other planets.

35
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.320
So be it.

36
00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.720
Benefits of serving the almighty Unicron.

37
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.220
They never learn.

38
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.320
Too late, Scourge.

39
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.520
Your master will be
trapped in this galaxy forever.

40
00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.440
No.

41
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:32.220
His sacrifice will be
our oath to preserve the key,

42
00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.420
no matter the cost.

43
00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.900
You let them slip away
with the Transwarp Key.

44
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.120
Scour the universe and find
where the Maximals have gone.

45
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.840
When you acquire the key,
use it to bring me to you.

46
00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.160
Yes, my lord.

47
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.000
Once I have the key

48
00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.500
I alone will reign supreme.

49
00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.720
All right, baby, come on.

50
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.300
All right, show me the money.

51
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.200
Here we go.

52
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.460
<i>Yo, Sonic, breakfast already up?</i>

53
00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.760
I ain't your butler, Kris.

54
00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.260
<i>Come on, man.
I'm calling himself the Airways.</i>

55
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.260
<i>It's Tails.</i>

56
00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.760
Oh, my bad.

57
00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.660
Christopher Diaz
from 974 Wilson Avenue,

58
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.760
apartment 2C, Brooklyn.

59
00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.760
<i>No real name. They are listen.</i>

60
00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.760
Ain't no secret government
agency's worried about us Tails.

61
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.860
Now get your mind
out of here while it's hot.

62
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.760
We still got that going for him.

63
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.760
Here, I earned this for you.
-I already earned it.

64
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.760
Like you cooked those eggs?

65
00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.960
What you mean? It's just seasoned.

66
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.760
Oh, come on.

67
00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.760
Come here, bro.

68
00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.760
I can't get past Bowser.

69
00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.760
Well, good morning to you, too.

70
00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.760
Drink this and take
your medicine, all of it.

71
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.160
Hey, are you sure you can take off?

72
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.960
Yeah, hospital's on the way.
You all got time?

73
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.760
That lady, that
administrator is there,

74
00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:11.660
and she mentions a bill. Just...

75
00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.260
Tell her we're handling it.

76
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.760
I will.

77
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.260
And after today,
I'll be able to help out more.

78
00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.160
Good luck on the interview.

79
00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.460
Don't forget to laugh at all the jokes.

80
00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.560
White people love that shit.
-Ma, language.

81
00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:27.260
Okay.

82
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.860
Remember I have class tonight,
so I'll be home late. <i>Lo quiero.</i>

83
00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.060
I love you. All right,
then we gotta get into the city.

84
00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.660
Hey, hold up, hold up.
Your hands hurting again?

85
00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.160
No, it's nothing.

86
00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.460
Let me see.

87
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.300
Kris.

88
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.120
It's swollen.

89
00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:58.380
Sickle cells must be
blocking the blood flow again.

90
00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.780
How long has this been going on?
-Couple days.

91
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.120
Yo, look, I told you.

92
00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.060
You gotta tell me these things.

93
00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.960
You fighting this alone
or we fighting it together?

94
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.560
Together.

95
00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:13.700
On team?

96
00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:15.740
On team.

97
00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.800
Two foot ten,
two foot stop touching everything.

98
00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.500
Oh hell, no.

99
00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.080
Kris, what I tell you about
letting your man come out the crib

100
00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.800
looking like a whole square?
-There's so much I could do.

101
00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.560
Yeah whatever bro, look. Here.

102
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.660
My dog.

103
00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:40.100
When you gonna let me put your skills
to work and get you some real money?

104
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:43.800
It says the dude can't even afford cable.
-Hit the guy who done went away.

105
00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.880
I choose not to purchase cable.
It's my own personal way

106
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.980
to protest the vampiric
nature of modern day capitalism.

107
00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.480
Take a look with that
interview with that dusty suit.

108
00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.640
Look at this. -Hey guys.

109
00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:43.240
That's a good one, but the inkling stars?
Most of the armor diamonds are new.

110
00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:58.840
Thank you so much.
Thank you, thank you for being here.

111
00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.740
Intern, intern, I paged you three times.

112
00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:02.760
Why didn't you call me?

113
00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.420
Okay, well, I figured if I stopped the call,

114
00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:07.340
they would make me later.

115
00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:08.900
The police are here.

116
00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:10.880
They busted an art auction.

117
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.300
The owner claims
that everything is authentic,

118
00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.720
but they want a second opinion.

119
00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.160
All right.

120
00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.760
The Da Vinci sketch is legit.

121
00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.240
The paint is a copy.

122
00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.780
Well, one's at the
National Gallery in London.

123
00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:31.100
Roman Vaz.

124
00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.980
Valuable, but you are not gonna retire.

125
00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:40.520
Sinners Greek curse tablet,
it would be expensive, but it's a fake.

126
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.140
How can you tell?

127
00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.440
See the speller? Roman.

128
00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.860
Doesn't even show up in our era.

129
00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.740
Got it.

130
00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.100
Officers, I figured it out.

131
00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.520
So, the Da Vinci, that is...

132
00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:06.340
Now where did you come from?

133
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.540
What are you?

134
00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:25.540
It's pretty neat, right? -Yes.

135
00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:29.240
Where is it from?
-They just discovered it in Sudan.

136
00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:33.340
The boys say it's Horus,
5th millennia BC Nubian.

137
00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:36.040
This symbol is definitely not hieroglyphic.

138
00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:38.940
Well, if it's as exotic as it looks,

139
00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.440
I'm gonna get a feature in Minerva.

140
00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.240
Julian.

141
00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:47.740
Okay, team. Let's do it.

142
00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:08.620
Okay, what are the rules?

143
00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:11.080
Girls before hoes.

144
00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:15.180
Don't be a problem.

145
00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:18.460
Don't go looking for a problem.
-Or else we're gonna have a problem.

146
00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.220
I know, I know.

147
00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.380
Okay, I'll be back in a little bit.

148
00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:30.260
Mr. Diaz?

149
00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:36.200
Hey, I know we're a little behind on the bill...
-Three months behind and until your account is current

150
00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.720
you can't bring your brother here.
I've told you that. -I'm gonna fix it.

151
00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:41.360
I just need a little more time.
-You can always take him to the ER.

152
00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:45.960
Well, they won't see him in the ER
unless he's critical. -Mr. Diaz... -He's 11.

153
00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.360
He's 11 years old.

154
00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:52.940
Come on Kris, we got to go.

155
00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:55.640
What happened?
-Tell you later, man, right?

156
00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.660
Come on, let's get out of here.

157
00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.400
Hey, you sit here.

158
00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:06.740
Don't move.

159
00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:10.740
<i>After a conference with Simpson's attorney,
Howard Weitzman, Simpson...</i> -Can I help you?

160
00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:14.380
Yes. Hey, I'm here for an interview
with the head of security, Mr. Bishop.

161
00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:15.840
I'm Noah Diaz.

162
00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:19.120
It's been canceled.
-No, it hasn't been a mistake.

163
00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.560
Then write for Mr. Bishop.

164
00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.720
Mr. Bishop. -Hey! Hey!

165
00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:30.020
It's okay, Walker.
-It's me, Noah Diaz.

166
00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:34.220
Sir, I think your boy back there is confused.
He said our interview is canceled. -Because it is.

167
00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:37.320
Wait, why? On the phone
you said I was perfect for the job.

168
00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:38.720
You said this was just a formality.

169
00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.420
It was until your old
commanding officer called me back.

170
00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.920
Said you were brave,
an expert Comtech, but unreliable.

171
00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:48.120
Couldn't trust you.
Your head was always somewhere else.

172
00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:52.020
Sir, I can't explain all of that. I had
some responsibilities at home. My brother...

173
00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:55.120
You had responsibility
to the United States Army.

174
00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:58.720
Mr. Bishop, sir,
I'm a hard worker. Okay?

175
00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:00.720
I just...

176
00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:03.120
I just really need a break.

177
00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:05.720
Listen, I can't have someone like you

178
00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.720
mess up what I built.

179
00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:09.920
Someone like me?

180
00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.720
You don't know anything about me!

181
00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:20.020
I know you don't know
how to be part of a team.

182
00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:23.720
My God.

183
00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:27.020
Hey, look, Superman
went on a bunch of interviews

184
00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.920
before he got his job
on the Daily Planet.

185
00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:32.720
Man, he never gave up.
-I'm not Superman, Kris.

186
00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:36.920
Life ain't a comment, though.
-I'm just saying, you'll get the next one.

187
00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:38.820
Yo, there is no next one.

188
00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:42.120
No one's coming to save us.
We're alone in this.

189
00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.720
Hey, man, I'm sorry.

190
00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:55.420
Sorry. -No, it's not.

191
00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:01.020
None of this is.

192
00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.720
Know what?

193
00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:11.820
Come on.

194
00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.720
Go ahead, bro.

195
00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:18.620
Let's head upstairs.
I'll be right there, all right?

196
00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.020
So what was you talking about earlier?

197
00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.240
Hey yo, you want one?

198
00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:48.380
No, I don't want any candy.

199
00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.320
You gotta relax, B.

200
00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:53.360
Your energy is really
affecting my chi, and I get it.

201
00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.920
I was nervous my first time too,

202
00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:58.320
but you might wanna do some
breathing exercises or something. Look at me.

203
00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.920
My man, my man, my man...

204
00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:09.700
It's just, I ain't done this before.

205
00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:12.560
I know that,
but them rich cats in there,

206
00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:16.000
they give a ton of paper to charities
every year to make themselves feel better.

207
00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:19.740
Hell, if you look at it from a
holistic perspective, we doing them a favor.

208
00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:21.600
Hey, yo, you're well!

209
00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:23.560
Yo, B, stop!

210
00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:24.560
What are you doing?

211
00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:27.440
This ain't about to
affect their pockets at all.

212
00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:31.120
And it's about to be easy as hell.
-So why you ain't the one going in there doing it?

213
00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:34.080
Because, Papito, I'm the mastermind.

214
00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:36.780
Now, come on, put this in your ear.

215
00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.280
My man, you serious?

216
00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:41.040
Yo, is that even clean?
-It's the fourth quarter.

217
00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:44.080
We got about 10 seconds left
on the clock, and you got the rock.

218
00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:46.860
That's too much.
-Well, hey, man!

219
00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:50.160
Don't slam the...

220
00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:58.800
Okay, I'm off to my fundraiser.

221
00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:00.300
What do you think?

222
00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.000
It's nice.

223
00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.800
Can I, can I have something by you?

224
00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.640
Hey.

225
00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:13.440
So I've been doing some research,
and I don't think that the statuette is Horace.

226
00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:15.640
As a matter of fact, I'm sure it's not.

227
00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:18.940
The boys dated it
around 5000 BC, right?

228
00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.140
But the Nubians,
they never even had contact

229
00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:24.900
with the Egyptians
until 600 years after that.

230
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.640
The symbol's not hieroglyphic.

231
00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:28.640
I don't even think it's
from that part of the world.

232
00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:31.940
I think it might be Aztec or Inca.

233
00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:34.640
It's not some Egyptian god.

234
00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:36.640
It's something else.

235
00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.640
Interesting.

236
00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.640
Get those pressed, okay?

237
00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:08.560
Yeah.

238
00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.760
There you go.

239
00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:14.260
Let that breath fill you up. <i>In, out.</i>

240
00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:16.360
Knees, stop talking.

241
00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.060
OK, all right. I get it.

242
00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:21.360
You don't like to chit chat back
and forth, but I got something for you.

243
00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.560
We got a Robin mixtape?

244
00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:30.860
<i>No.</i> I got a liberating mixtape.

245
00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:45.100
You're feeling that, huh?

246
00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:47.320
Yeah, whatever.

247
00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:55.840
<i>Aight, there shouldn't be nobody
in this part of the building.</i>

248
00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:58.380
<i>We shouldn't be able
to just walk right on in.</i>

249
00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.360
Strike one, that's the mind.
This place is packed.

250
00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.720
Hey, Walter, everybody is divine.

251
00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.440
<i>Just act like you own the place.</i>

252
00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:11.060
Hey, what's up, brother?
Good to see you again.

253
00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.020
<i>Try not to look suspicious.</i>

254
00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:18.940
Here you go, here you go.
Sorry, sorry. That's you, bro.

255
00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:22.000
Nice glasses.
I didn't know you had glasses.

256
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.300
<i>What are you doing, making friends?</i>

257
00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.240
<i>Everything good?</i>

258
00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:35.040
We're here to mix.

259
00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:40.280
Hey.

260
00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:42.480
Let's see what you really are.

261
00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:54.800
<i>Now my man said
it's tucked in the back.</i>

262
00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:57.000
Been there a couple weeks.

263
00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:00.900
<i>It's like the grayish car with like a... </i>

264
00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:03.100
Little stripe.

265
00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:20.200
<i>Alright now just like
brother Rick showed you.</i>

266
00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:22.300
Down the window.

267
00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:25.100
A little wibble.

268
00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.400
Feel that snag and...

269
00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:29.800
<i>Yeah.</i>

270
00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:31.900
Now we makin' money.

271
00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:58.400
All right, talk to me, homie.

272
00:21:58.500 --> 00:21:59.660
<i>I'm in.</i>

273
00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:01.660
This ought to be it.

274
00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.840
Stop, stop! Please.

275
00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:23.860
No, no, no.

276
00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:31.840
I'm gonna lose my job.

277
00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:36.600
I'm gonna lose job.

278
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.600
It's definitely not Nubian.

279
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.100
This cannot be.

280
00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:38.600
Calling all Autobots! Calling all Autobots!

281
00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:40.600
Yippee ki-yay!

282
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.600
Prime, this is RC. I have a visual.

283
00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.600
What am I looking at?

284
00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:53.600
A way home.

285
00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:01.500
Calling all Autobots! Calling all Autobots!

286
00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:09.300
What am I doing?
<i>-Well, the cops is clear out here,</i>

287
00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:12.100
<i>so whenever you want to slide
that thing on out, you good.</i>

288
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.740
I can't. I can't.

289
00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:16.600
<i>Like you can't drive stick
or something?</i>  -No, it's just...

290
00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:18.600
I ain't no thief.

291
00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:20.900
<i>Are you having an
existential crisis now?</i>

292
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.100
The deadline for that was
when I offered you Twizzlers.

293
00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.100
This is an emergency.
Can you hear me, Mirage?

294
00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.200
Roll out.

295
00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:31.100
Yo, who the hell was that? -It's the
radio bro. This car is bugged. I'm out.

296
00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:34.200
Hey!

297
00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:37.220
Shit. Oh shit.

298
00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:40.100
Hey you!

299
00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:42.380
Get out of the car!

300
00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:45.980
I'm trying. The car started by itself.
I promise. Look, it's not working.

301
00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:47.720
Get out now!

302
00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.620
Hold up, wait! What you doing?

303
00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:59.540
NOS?

304
00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:04.320
Reek, Reek!

305
00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:06.700
Now let's talk to your manifestation.

306
00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:10.300
Dude, the car is driving by itself!

307
00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:14.480
Noah, you good?
-I don't know what's going on!

308
00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:15.980
It won't stop!

309
00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:18.020
Stop, stop! Why don't you listening?

310
00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:20.960
<i>But you might want to slow down.</i>
-It's not me. The car is possessed.

311
00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:24.280
<i>No, no, no.</i>
You just saw the adrenaline hot.

312
00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:26.780
Let's do some of them
breathing exercises.

313
00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:30.800
Yo, I don't need no breathing
exercises. The car's driving by itself.

314
00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:34.140
No. No.

315
00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:36.460
No, Reek, what do we do?

316
00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:38.140
No, I cannot hear you.

317
00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:40.240
Reek! -No, I can't.

318
00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:46.840
No, we did not!
No, you did not just leave me!

319
00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.640
Pull over! -Help me!

320
00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:34.180
Drive. Drive, drive, drive!

321
00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.900
The bridge. The bridge!
Take the Williamsburg!

322
00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:02.740
I got a 10-37 in
progress, silver Porsche.

323
00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:06.940
How serious, man?

324
00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:13.740
Oh, nah. Oh, nah.

325
00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:23.940
Help me with something, please!

326
00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:37.740
Oh! Yo, nah!

327
00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:39.740
Nah, nah, nah!

328
00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:47.440
Come in, come in!

329
00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.740
Can you hear me, Mirage? -What?

330
00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:03.440
Four us.

331
00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:27.840
Yo, yo, slow down! Slow down!

332
00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:41.280
Woo hoo hoo!

333
00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:42.840
That felt good!

334
00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:45.200
Get some oil pumping, you know!

335
00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.760
Damn!

336
00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:48.160
I haven't cooped up forever, dude.

337
00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.320
I can't tell you how old it gets.

338
00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:52.300
Mirage, stay hidden!

339
00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:55.440
Mirage, don't draw
any attention to yourself!

340
00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:58.080
Mirage, Big is just a movie!

341
00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:00.440
You'll never be a real boy!

342
00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:02.840
But that was fun, man.
You're fun, dude.

343
00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:06.940
Alright. This is probably
a lot for you, huh?

344
00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:11.440
Back off! -Hey, whoa, whoa,
what's with the aggression.

345
00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:15.240
Well, I thought after the car chase
we were boys. You gonna hit me?

346
00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:16.440
Maybe.

347
00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:18.440
Just like that?

348
00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:27.140
Tough guy. I like that. I like it a lot.

349
00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:31.280
What are you? Some sort
of possessed car or something?

350
00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:34.560
Nah, that's not real man. I'm an alien.

351
00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:36.720
Like, like E.T.?

352
00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:40.320
E.T., the little ugly guy
in the basket? Look at this face!

353
00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:42.120
The name's Mirage.

354
00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:47.760
Come on, give me a little,
give me a little, give me a little tap.

355
00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:49.240
Give me a little tap.

356
00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:51.380
There you go, now we're friends.

357
00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:54.040
Oh great, the gang's here.

358
00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:55.440
They're more like you?

359
00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:56.400
Like me?

360
00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:59.400
Nah, but be cool so they
don't crush you. -What?

361
00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:02.000
Yeah, I'd put that
pipe down if I were you.

362
00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:31.300
Well, well.

363
00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:33.080
Soon we got here.

364
00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:40.400
Mirage, what have you done?

365
00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:42.900
You brought a human here?

366
00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:45.620
Optimus, hey! Looking good, man!

367
00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:47.380
Wait a second, are those new ribs?

368
00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:49.460
You were told to stay hidden.

369
00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:51.460
Right, right. Crazy coincidence.

370
00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:53.700
When you called all Optimus-like...

371
00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.860
Autobots roll out!

372
00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:59.920
This guy was already in the car,
but he's cool, so it's cool. Cool?

373
00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:02.660
Not cool.

374
00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:06.420
Who are you, human?

375
00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:11.280
I'm nobody. I ain't even seen nothing.
I'm not even seeing anything right now.

376
00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.380
RC.

377
00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:18.380
Private Noah Diaz, US Army.

378
00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:21.180
Multiple commendations,
a wizard with electronics.

379
00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:23.320
He's a soldier.

380
00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:26.380
He does not look like a soldier.

381
00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:28.960
I mean, you're looking
pretty rough yourself.

382
00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:31.940
Sorry, sir.

383
00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:34.360
I will deal with your mistake later.

384
00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:39.340
Okay, the energy surge we felt

385
00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:43.340
was in the 4000 yadahertz range,
which is undetectable to humans.

386
00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:46.340
I've reconstructed
the source from the energy echoes.

387
00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:50.340
I cannot believe it.
It exists and it is here.

388
00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:52.340
What the hell am I looking at?

389
00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:57.340
The transwock key. It was thought
to be lost thousands of years ago.

390
00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:01.340
It was once used
to open space-time portals

391
00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:04.540
to energon rich planets
throughout the universe.

392
00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:07.340
You mean energon-rich planets like...

393
00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:08.340
Cybertron.

394
00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:11.220
After seven long years
stranded on Earth,

395
00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:13.880
we finally found a way home.

396
00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:15.560
Where did that catch you, Lake?

397
00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:18.560
Okay, so where is this tran...

398
00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:20.220
Transwarp Key? -Thank you.

399
00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:22.100
It's in the new museum on Ellis Island.

400
00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:24.720
Let's blow it up!
Get the hell out of that.

401
00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:27.900
No, we can't just go in
blasting and steal it, B.

402
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000
The humans will hunt us down.

403
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.340
What we need is a quiet way in.

404
00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:39.940
Ooh, how about him?

405
00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:40.940
No.

406
00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:42.340
What? Come on, man.

407
00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:44.540
He could slip in right
through one of them little doors.

408
00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:47.240
Grab the key, leave a
nice IOU, and peace out.

409
00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:48.640
He's perfect.

410
00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:50.040
What?

411
00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:52.240
No, it is a bad idea.

412
00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:54.040
I agree with big man.

413
00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:56.540
So, it's been real, y'all?

414
00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:58.440
What? -Time out.

415
00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:00.740
No, no, I know.
I know who to relax.

416
00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:02.640
Let me just talk to my guy real quick.

417
00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.940
Yo, don't leave me
with these tight asses, bro.

418
00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:06.140
We make a great team.

419
00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:08.140
This is a waste of time.

420
00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:10.900
Look, I'm not bringing in
a museum for some space robots.

421
00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:13.900
But what about for friendship?

422
00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:16.100
Uh, uh, or, or, or...

423
00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:18.500
What about for cash?

424
00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:22.620
You help us get this key
so we can get off this rock.

425
00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:23.460
No offense.

426
00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:24.860
Love the neighborhood and all.

427
00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:28.660
And then I let you sell me.

428
00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:30.380
Lambo?

429
00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:31.980
Ferrari?

430
00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:34.620
Elite?

431
00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:37.820
Look, you get paid, and then I'll split.

432
00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:39.640
So all I gotta do is walk in and out.

433
00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:42.600
All you gotta do,
we'll take care of the rest.

434
00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:44.900
Cross my spark and hope to die.

435
00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:47.360
Wow, that was corny
when I said it out loud.

436
00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:52.200
And what about the big man,
Optimal or whatever?

437
00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:54.640
You let me worry about him.

438
00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:56.480
Cool?

439
00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:00.160
Ah, got him, easy baby, woo!

440
00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:29.040
So y'all are robots
that transform into cars,

441
00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:31.520
even though you're
from way out in space.

442
00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:34.120
But now there's this key
that opens a portal back to your home?

443
00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:37.040
Oh, and you know this because
there's a beacon light in the sky

444
00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.960
that I can't see because I'm human.

445
00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:40.560
You say that like it's weird.

446
00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:41.560
It's super weird.

447
00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:42.720
You know what's weird?

448
00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:44.920
Marky Mark is leaving the funky bunch.

449
00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:46.960
I heard he's just
gonna pursue acting now.

450
00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:48.820
That's crazy.
-What? How does that even...

451
00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:50.480
What a world.

452
00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:51.720
Whatever, man.

453
00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:53.160
I'm just trying to collect this money

454
00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:56.160
and get your angry-ass boss
off Earth before he blows a gasket.

455
00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:57.520
Don't take it personal.

456
00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:59.640
He just misses home.

457
00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:02.940
And I think he blamed
himself for us getting stuck here.

458
00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:05.020
Earth was supposed
to be a pit stop, you know?

459
00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:09.360
A place for us to regroup
and rejoin the war back home.

460
00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:11.660
Prime feels like it's his
fault we've been stranded here.

461
00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:14.620
Like, he has to fix it all on his own.

462
00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:15.860
All right, team, heads up.

463
00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:16.960
There's security up ahead.

464
00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.000
Nice.

465
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.480
This is going to be fun, man.
-No, bro, you need to switch it up.

466
00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:23.380
You need to turn into a helicopter

467
00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:25.040
or a speedboat or something.

468
00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:27.220
I got something way better than that.

469
00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:42.060
Good call.

470
00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:46.440
I do not like this plan.

471
00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:49.440
Yeah, Mirage isn't really
known for being quiet.

472
00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:51.640
At least Mirage is one of us.

473
00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:54.180
We should not be relying on a human.

474
00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:55.680
They are my friends.

475
00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:59.680
I know one was good to you,
Bee, but this is not our world.

476
00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:02.680
The humans will always
protect what is theirs.

477
00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:05.680
We can only trust our own kind.

478
00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:07.680
You can't handle the truth!

479
00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:11.880
I do not want you going to
that drive-in theater anymore.

480
00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:59.480
Nightbird, search the island.

481
00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:04.480
Finally, the hunt draws to a close.

482
00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:33.280
Hello?

483
00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:51.160
Fudge.

484
00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:59.540
Are you okay?

485
00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:01.400
Yo, you okay?

486
00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:04.340
I didn't think anyone was in here.

487
00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:08.200
That's it.

488
00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:13.380
Who are you?

489
00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:16.680
I'm a janitor.

490
00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:20.240
Security!

491
00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:22.420
No, no, no!
You don't have to do that.

492
00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:26.540
It's not what it looks like. -It looks
like you're trying to steal museum property.

493
00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:28.980
Okay, it's a little what it looks like.

494
00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:36.040
Hey! Hey, hey!
It doesn't belong to you anywhere.

495
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:39.960
Just stop, just...
Hey, hey! Relax, relax.

496
00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:43.960
And let me explain, it belongs to...

497
00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:47.940
To these... 

498
00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:53.940
To these giant robots from space.

499
00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:56.040
Really?

500
00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:58.080
Look, I'm gonna need that. -Stop!

501
00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:02.100
Damn! -Damn?

502
00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:03.820
Hey, hey, hey!

503
00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:07.660
What's going on here? Don't move!
-Man, it's about time you showed up!

504
00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:16.420
The key.

505
00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.620
You were telling the truth.

506
00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:45.120
Yeah, but those ones aren't with me.

507
00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:55.620
Rip the flesh from their
bones and bring me the key.

508
00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:02.120
It's yours.

509
00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:14.620
Guys, we got company!

510
00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:24.160
Autobots, protect the key!

511
00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:40.280
Not so fast!

512
00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:48.280
Oh, they're flying now?
Who the hell are these guys?

513
00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:00.280
Impossible.

514
00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:03.360
I enjoy that look of confusion

515
00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:07.120
when an inferior being
meets a higher power.

516
00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:18.600
What the hell are those things?

517
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.500
Are you okay?

518
00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:27.000
Hey, stop follow me.
-I'm not follow you.

519
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.300
I'm just escaping
in the same direction.

520
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.020
We're moving

521
00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:27.560
Keeping strong

522
00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:31.140
Don't you let them steer you wrong

523
00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:34.300
It's a groove thang

524
00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:40.940
We're gonna give you what you want

525
00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:43.180
Just as long...

526
00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:50.500
Run!

527
00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:51.840
Go, go!

528
00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:03.680
Run!

529
00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:06.280
Go, go, go, go, go!

530
00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:10.280
Get her out!

531
00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:16.580
How is that?

532
00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:19.240
Thanks.

533
00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:27.300
Scourge, I have eyes on the key.

534
00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:31.340
Prime, I don't think
we can hold these guys...

535
00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:33.340
No! No!

536
00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:34.780
Oh my god! Put me down!

537
00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:36.220
No!

538
00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:39.780
Whoa, I'm so scared.

539
00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:42.380
Oh, cool, you're still alive.

540
00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:46.200
Get the key!

541
00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:48.900
Noah, get out of here!

542
00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:52.100
Get off me! I hate spiders!

543
00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:55.900
Go, go, go!

544
00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:02.900
Go! Get out of here!

545
00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:12.400
Leaving some soon?

546
00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:15.400
Come on, go!

547
00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:20.880
The key!

548
00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:28.840
Enough of these games,
I'll get it myself.

549
00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:30.800
Not on my watch.

550
00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:01.920
Don't be frightened, humans.

551
00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:04.920
This'll all be over soon.

552
00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:10.920
And you call yourself a prime?

553
00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:13.920
Primus would be ashamed.

554
00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:30.920
I'm tired of little things
getting in my way.

555
00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:32.920
Bee!

556
00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:35.920
Look back to my chapter.

557
00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:37.720
No!

558
00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:57.920
Bee...

559
00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:06.040
Now to add a prime to my collection.

560
00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:20.840
Maximus. -Good.

561
00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:22.840
Maybe we'll get a real fight.

562
00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:26.340
No, we got what we came for.

563
00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:34.140
No.

564
00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:37.360
This cannot be.

565
00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:57.820
We must go now. Come with me.

566
00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:23.880
This is my fault.

567
00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:25.560
It should have been me.

568
00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:29.240
I'm sorry for your loss.

569
00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:32.440
 No offense lady,
but who are you again? 

570
00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:35.640
My name is Airazor.

571
00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:40.980
I am a maximal, a warrior
from both your past and future.

572
00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:44.480
Oh, right. That tracks. Yeah.

573
00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:48.340
We fled our whole planet
on the eve of this destruction. 

574
00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:51.840
We sought refuge and hit here on earth. 

575
00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:56.540
Alright so you're a Maximal, y'all are Autobots,
what was those things that attacked us earlier?

576
00:47:56.540 --> 00:48:00.640
Terraconts.
Servants of a dark hungry god

577
00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:04.040
who feeds on entire
worlds to sustain himself.

578
00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:09.420
Unicron. -So you're saying this
thing Unicron eats planets to survive? 

579
00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:12.700
Yes. And heimbues his servants

580
00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:18.600
like scourge with dark energy
which makes him all but invincible.

581
00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:21.780
He is entirely beholden to Unicron.

582
00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:25.980
Through his power,
he possesses Scourge's soul.

583
00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:29.580
Awaken my dark master.

584
00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:50.160
Rise.

585
00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:53.160
My hunger is killing me.

586
00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:55.160
What have you found?

587
00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:56.160
Salvation.

588
00:48:56.160 --> 00:49:01.120
The galaxy will once again
be yours to feast on my master.

589
00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:08.000
I should have gotten the key myself.
I should have known better than to rely on humans.

590
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000
Hold up, were you blaming me?

591
00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:14.080
After you conveniently left out
the part about a planet eating monster?

592
00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:18.680
Because of you, Unicron will now use
the key to consume every planet in the universe.

593
00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:21.440
Including my home world.

594
00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:24.720
He doesn't have the key.
At least not all of it.

595
00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:26.920
You fool!

596
00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:30.720
This is only half the key.

597
00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:33.720
Please! The Maximals!

598
00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:36.720
They must have split it!

599
00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:37.720
Excuses!

600
00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:43.120
Complete the key or else you will wish
you had died with the rest of your planet.

601
00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:47.220
We broke the key into
two pieces for safe keeping, 

602
00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:49.820
then splintered and went into hiding.

603
00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:53.220
I do not know where the other half is.

604
00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:57.920
For all I know,
I am the last of our kind.

605
00:49:58.420 --> 00:50:00.420
This is from Peru?

606
00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:01.920
How do you know that?

607
00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:03.920
It's the symbols on the stone.

608
00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:06.920
They were only ever recorded
in one other place in the world.

609
00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:09.220
The Inca Temple of the Sun in Cusco.

610
00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:11.920
It's one of the oldest buildings
in the Western Hemisphere.

611
00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:15.920
I'm guessing that that
can't be a coincidence.

612
00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:19.920
If you can track those symbols
to Peru, so can the Terracons.

613
00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:21.920
We need to get there before they do.

614
00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:26.640
And then kill Scourge and
take his piece to complete the key.

615
00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:28.640
Now hold up. Hold up.

616
00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:33.520
You wanna find this other key and
deliver it to the guy that just kicked your asses?

617
00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:36.000
The transwarp key
is our only way home.

618
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.280
If this dude gets a hold of
that thing, it's game over for Earth.

619
00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:41.280
Our families, everybody.

620
00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:45.920
I'm going.

621
00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:47.760
Out of the question.

622
00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:49.840
No offense.

623
00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:54.080
But I'm not trusting my home
to a guy who couldn't even protect his.

624
00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:56.180
It's my planet.

625
00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:57.680
I'm going.

626
00:50:57.780 --> 00:50:59.780
What about you?

627
00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:02.880
Me?

628
00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:04.880
What is your name?

629
00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:08.080
Elena. -Elena.

630
00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:10.780
Will you lead us to this temple?

631
00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:15.780
Chance to stop the end of the world.

632
00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:17.480
Actually,

633
00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:20.280
you'll be saving two worlds.

634
00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:29.440
Yeah.

635
00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:41.040
<i>Yo, is that you, Sonic?</i>

636
00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:45.720
What you doing up, Tails?

637
00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:47.760
<i>I can't sleep.</i>

638
00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:00.040
It's too hot?

639
00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:02.580
You playing that game too much.

640
00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:04.780
Give it a rest
so your hand can take a break.

641
00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:06.820
I'm gonna beat it.

642
00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:10.620
My money's on you, bro.

643
00:52:10.620 --> 00:52:14.460
We don't quit.
Come on, get some sleep, all right?

644
00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:25.980
Yo listen...
I gotta head out for a while.

645
00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:28.420
I don't know when I'm gonna be back.

646
00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:30.440
Why?

647
00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:34.920
Oh shit!

648
00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:41.920
No! Oh no!

649
00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:44.380
Stop, stop, please, turn it off!

650
00:52:44.380 --> 00:52:46.420
What are you doing?
I told you to sit tight!

651
00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:51.140
Is not enough? I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
-Is that a robot? -No, no. Go back to bed.

652
00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:52.180
Shut it off!

653
00:52:52.180 --> 00:52:56.100
I had hot wires, so I messed up my life.
-I got the bat. -Give me that.

654
00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:58.700
Did he say bat?
-You gonna wake up Mom.

655
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.140
I know you're a robot.

656
00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:08.860
Kris!

657
00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:18.180
Yo! You scratched my paint!

658
00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:21.180
What are you doing?

659
00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:23.180
Man, they didn't treat E.T. like this.

660
00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:27.180
You know this thing?
-Yeah, we're just work friends.

661
00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:30.180
Work friends? You've been inside me.

662
00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:35.280
Look, the thing I told you I have
to go do is wear him and his crew.

663
00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:37.180
We're trying to stop the end of the world.

664
00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:41.180
The world's ending?
-No. -Maybe. Sixty, forty.

665
00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:43.180
You know I'm not gonna let that happen.

666
00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:45.480
But that's why I have to leave.

667
00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:50.720
I'll go get my things.

668
00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:53.020
Tough kid. -What? No.

669
00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:55.060
Whoa, whoa. Hold on, hold on.

670
00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:58.360
You're not coming. -Why?
You need someone to watch your back.

671
00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:00.520
It's too dangerous, Kris.

672
00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:04.120
And I need you to stay here
and take care of Mom.

673
00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:08.760
'Cause you might not come back.

674
00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:23.440
Hey, robot.

675
00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:26.440
Me? What's up?

676
00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:30.840
Watch out for my brother. Okay?

677
00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:32.740
You got it, little man.

678
00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:34.440
Nah, I'm serious.

679
00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:37.240
If he gets hurt, I'm coming after you.

680
00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:41.440
Don't worry. I got Noah's back.

681
00:54:41.540 --> 00:54:43.380
I promise.

682
00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:47.680
Hong-Ting?

683
00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:51.800
Hong-Ting.

684
00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:57.400
Kid's got heart.

685
00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:13.700
Wu Tang is in the building, baby!

686
00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:16.060
Way to be incognito.

687
00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:18.740
Aw, come on, Prime. Smile a little bit.

688
00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:20.940
It won't hurt.
Let me see that underbite.

689
00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:22.060
All right.

690
00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:24.260
So what kind of jet we taking to Peru?

691
00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:27.440
Or is it a plane? Either one's fine.
I just need first class, okay?

692
00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:28.700
'Cause I got long-ass legs.

693
00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:30.580
Well, he is a plane.

694
00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:31.820
No! No, no.

695
00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:34.180
Don't tell me we're flying on...

696
00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:35.780
Oh no!

697
00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:58.180
My lads! I am Stratosphere,
Lord of the Skies!

698
00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:07.680
Yeah, I'm walking to Peru.

699
00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:20.280
Oh my gosh.

700
00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:28.380
<i>But I think you're moving too fast.</i>

701
00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:30.780
Sorry.

702
00:56:30.780 --> 00:56:33.700
I sing when I get nervous.
It usually calms me down.

703
00:56:33.740 --> 00:56:35.520
First time flying?

704
00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:38.700
And it's my first time leaving New York.

705
00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:40.320
Oh, my God.

706
00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:42.340
Oh, God.

707
00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:44.920
So the Bronx, huh?

708
00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:48.460
Brooklyn, all right?
East New York all day.

709
00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:51.080
I'm from Bushwick. -Really?

710
00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:55.680
Me and my dad,
we used to go to this pizza spot

711
00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:57.240
down on Nickafauka and Green.

712
00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:58.640
Tony's Pizza?

713
00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:00.180
Wow.

714
00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:07.120
Tell me about your pops.

715
00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:12.160
What was he like?
-He was a cabbie for 40 years.

716
00:57:12.660 --> 00:57:15.000
Smartest guy you ever met.

717
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.160
They could talk to you about anything.

718
00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:20.000
History, science, cricket.

719
00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:22.040
Cricket?

720
00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:25.300
He ain't never even
go to college either.

721
00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:27.240
I used to always say,

722
00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:29.760
if you keep your eyes
and your ears open,

723
00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:33.580
life will show you
everything you need to know.

724
00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:38.540
So that's why you
say yes to all of this?

725
00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:40.860
I figured if he is somewhere watching,

726
00:57:40.860 --> 00:57:44.960
then seeing his daughter
do something crazy like this,

727
00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:48.000
would definitely make him proud.

728
00:57:57.540 --> 00:57:59.940
Do you really think
this key thing's in Peru?

729
00:57:59.940 --> 00:58:01.540
I think so.

730
00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:04.540
The evidence lines up.

731
00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:08.040
You know, if it is,
when we get our hands on it,

732
00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:09.840
you know we gotta destroy it.

733
00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:11.540
What?

734
00:58:11.540 --> 00:58:14.540
It can't unite the key
without both pieces.

735
00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:18.420
No key, no Unicron,
no Earth-game Eden.

736
00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:25.220
Yeah, but didn't they kick you?

737
00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:27.620
We gotta think about us.

738
00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:33.600
All you gotta do is find it,

739
00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:35.900
and I'll take care of the rest.

740
00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:43.900
Do you think an energon
infusion could bring him back?

741
00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:48.900
Perhaps if we could
get him back to Cybertron.

742
00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:54.100
I never should have
taken us so far from home.

743
01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:26.800
Wow, wheeljack needs
to fix that power steering.

744
01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:32.900
Sorry I'm late.
I was taking in a harmonious moment

745
01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:36.620
between a serene butterfly
and an unruffled caterpillar.

746
01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:38.760
Substrung queasy.

747
01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:41.040
Yo, oh yeah, papa, where you from?

748
01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:42.140
Cybertron.

749
01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:43.560
So where'd you get that accent?

750
01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:44.980
Accent? What accent?

751
01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:47.120
You know what I'm saying?
I'm just, I'm saying it's cool.

752
01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:49.740
Like I was about to be like, yo,
<i>mira papa y de donde eres.</i>

753
01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:52.680
I didn't want to assume
that you speak Spanish too.

754
01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:54.380
Because then, right?

755
01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:57.180
A little racist, Hermano.

756
01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:59.280
I'm not trying to be, you know, yo.

757
01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:01.280
But anyway, the mission.

758
01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:02.780
Follow me.

759
01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:05.280
He's a robot, like, so...

760
01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:07.280
How's that racist?

761
01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:12.780
Okay, guys, check this out.

762
01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:15.780
The coordinates you gave me
correspond to an old church.

763
01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:17.580
Take a look.

764
01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:21.560
That's Santo Domingo.

765
01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:23.520
The Spanish built it
on top of a Oinca temple.

766
01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:26.660
<i>Correcto.</i> I picked up some
residual energy readings

767
01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:30.140
around the courtyard, so I'm
guessing the key's somewhere close by.

768
01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:32.800
But we may have
some trouble getting there.

769
01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:36.720
Indiraimi, it's a festival
that shuts down the whole city.

770
01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:38.160
Guess it's a night mission then.

771
01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:41.640
No, Scourge could already be here.

772
01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:44.920
We must retrieve
the other half before he does.

773
01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:48.820
Me and Elena will do it.

774
01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:51.120
Y'all never make it two blocks.

775
01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:54.120
There's human security all around
the church. You'll never get through.

776
01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:56.720
Then we'll have to take
a play out of your book.

777
01:01:56.820 --> 01:01:58.920
We'll hide in plain sight.

778
01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:01.420
We'll blend in with the parade.

779
01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:04.120
It is not a bad idea.

780
01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:07.120
We will keep
an eye out for the Terracons.

781
01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:11.120
Our first sign of trouble
we are going in.

782
01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:13.120
Yo, Noah, think fast.

783
01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:22.260
And if you need help just holler.

784
01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:39.280
I am in position.

785
01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:41.280
Alright, coast is clear.

786
01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:44.280
Noah, Elena, it's go time.

787
01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:47.280
Blend in. Act natural.

788
01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:25.060
Autobots must be using
their new pets to reach the temple.

789
01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:27.060
Lovely.

790
01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:30.060
They're doing our work for us.

791
01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:32.080
Go fetch.

792
01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:39.140
Key's gotta be in here somewhere.

793
01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:41.040
Yeah.

794
01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:57.240
That stone work is 17th century.

795
01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:03.240
What we're looking for
is something much, much older.

796
01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:13.500
What is it?

797
01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:15.880
It's the same insignia on Airazorr.

798
01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:17.540
But it's not lined up right.

799
01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:22.080
Wait, you see that?

800
01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:26.200
I think there's something under here.

801
01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:32.540
There's another one.

802
01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:49.200
Now where?

803
01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:51.440
I thought it was...

804
01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:08.840
It's some "Indiana Jones"-type shit.

805
01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:10.840
You sure about this?

806
01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:13.340
No.

807
01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:25.340
Any sign of Scourge?
-Nope. All clear here.

808
01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:28.240
Yeah, it's just groupies over here.

809
01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:33.740
Stay on task, Mirage.
-Prime, you gotta learn how to relax, my man.

810
01:05:56.440 --> 01:06:00.340
You know, you must be the first people
to walk here in half a millennium.

811
01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:05.840
<i>Yo, Sonic, you dead yet?</i>

812
01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:07.840
No.

813
01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:09.840
Wait, did you just call me Sonic?

814
01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:12.440
I think that's a temple.

815
01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:20.840
What are we looking for?

816
01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:22.840
You see the symbols on that temple?

817
01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:24.840
They match the ones in a courtyard.

818
01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:26.840
I think it's up there.

819
01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:39.720
I think we found what we came here for.

820
01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:44.900
I always wondered what
it would feel like to be there

821
01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:47.100
when artifacts were actually found.

822
01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:52.440
All right. Now come on, push.

823
01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:02.540
Are you even pushing?

824
01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:04.740
Yeah, I'm pushing.

825
01:07:14.540 --> 01:07:16.540
Wait. Wait, what?

826
01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:17.540
Just let me think.

827
01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:20.040
Oh, no. Where is it?

828
01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:24.540
Sometimes there's like
a false bottom or something.

829
01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:31.100
Look, I think I found something.

830
01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:32.460
You see these symbols?

831
01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:33.940
I've seen markings like this.

832
01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:36.080
The Airazor statue in my museum.

833
01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:37.700
They're new.

834
01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:40.260
They're not on the transwarp key.

835
01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:42.300
There's two of them.

836
01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:52.540
Raj.

837
01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:57.240
Let's keep moving.

838
01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:59.240
Just give me a second.

839
01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:04.440
Run!

840
01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:14.240
Go, go, go!

841
01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:18.740
We got trouble! One of the things
is down here! Where are you guys?

842
01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:20.940
Hang tight! I'm on the way!

843
01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:27.740
The Autobots are moving.
They must have found the key.

844
01:08:41.740 --> 01:08:43.740
Airazor, where are the humans?

845
01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:45.900
The Underground,
heading towards the jungle.

846
01:09:03.900 --> 01:09:06.120
Aw, man! They're tailing us!

847
01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:17.820
Do something! -You moving in too?

848
01:09:25.220 --> 01:09:27.320
We had a gun this whole time.

849
01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:47.620
Prime! What the hell are you doing?

850
01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:53.220
I'm going to take that Scourge's
key and then take off his head.

851
01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:06.520
Guys!

852
01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:08.220
I can use a little help!

853
01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:10.220
Did someone call for backup?

854
01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:20.220
Wait, wait, wait! -What?

855
01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:22.220
Wait!

856
01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:35.600
This is for me.

857
01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:49.600
Come here.

858
01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:51.460
Hold on.

859
01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:13.560
I love your fire, Prime,

860
01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:17.700
but you're going to die
on this speck of dust.

861
01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:21.200
I can think of no
better place to bury you.

862
01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:51.200
I will end your Scourge.

863
01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:56.360
That is a promise.

864
01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:58.360
They're getting away.

865
01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:00.560
Not this time.

866
01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:09.880
I hear water.

867
01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:15.560
Where are we?

868
01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:23.180
What was that?

869
01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:38.220
Who are you?

870
01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:40.580
Why are you hunting for the key?

871
01:12:40.580 --> 01:12:42.740
Yo Donkey Kong,
stay away from my friend.

872
01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:43.900
Oh, Mariah.

873
01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:46.100
Don't worry, your boy's got this.

874
01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:51.380
Stranger danger! Stranger danger!

875
01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:53.320
Hey, hey, hey!

876
01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:55.420
Not so fast!

877
01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:00.220
Aye, aye, aye.

878
01:13:00.220 --> 01:13:02.760
Hey, over here, kitty kitty.

879
01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:05.480
Stand down!

880
01:13:08.620 --> 01:13:11.300
I won't ask a second time.

881
01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.300
No! All of you, stop!

882
01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:22.500
Arid!

883
01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:27.000
Primal, I thought you were lost. All of you.

884
01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:30.000
The others, are they...

885
01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:33.500
I am all that is left.

886
01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:40.100
Prime, these are my fellow Maximals.

887
01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:42.900
Rhinox. Cheetor.

888
01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.800
Sorry about scaring you, brother.

889
01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:48.100
Scared? Please, I'm not scared.

890
01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:50.300
That's just engine oil.

891
01:13:51.100 --> 01:13:54.300
And our leader, Optimus Primal.

892
01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:57.300
Optimus Primal?

893
01:13:57.500 --> 01:14:01.800
Named after you,
the legendary warrior of Cybertron.

894
01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:04.100
It's an honor.

895
01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:07.600
Airazor, I'm happy
to see you, old friend.

896
01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:10.800
But bringing others here
was not part of our plan.

897
01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.300
I fear you bring dark tidings.

898
01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:17.740
Scourge has come to Earth.
-He's found us.

899
01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:20.340
And he has half of the key.

900
01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:23.140
We must find the
second piece before he does.

901
01:14:23.140 --> 01:14:26.040
But it wasn't in a cave. -It was. 

902
01:14:26.140 --> 01:14:30.840
But we moved it long ago
to keep it safe. -Where is it now?

903
01:14:33.660 --> 01:14:35.800
Come with me.

904
01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:45.060
That doesn't look so good.

905
01:14:45.060 --> 01:14:49.060
When Scourge touches you,
he leaves a mark.

906
01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:51.060
But I'll be all right.

907
01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:06.460
Hey, back then you called me Sonic.

908
01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:07.460
Yeah.

909
01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:11.460
Your little bro's got this thing about
using real names over the airwaves, so...

910
01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:13.360
You been talking to Kris?

911
01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:16.460
He gave me this to keep tabs on you.

912
01:15:16.460 --> 01:15:18.460
Make sure I'm keeping my promise.

913
01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:19.460
Oh, here.

914
01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:21.460
Next time, include warning labels.

915
01:15:21.460 --> 01:15:24.060
Nah, go ahead. Keep it.

916
01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:26.560
I guess it does look better on me.

917
01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:29.960
Just don't ask where
part of my body it came from.

918
01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:34.460
So, who are you?

919
01:15:34.460 --> 01:15:40.460
We Maximals are an advanced race, dedicated
to the expansion of life throughout the universe.

920
01:15:40.460 --> 01:15:44.460
We use the Transwarp Key
to visit young worlds.

921
01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:49.460
The Nazca Lines? The temple at Tikal?
That was you guys, right?

922
01:15:49.660 --> 01:15:53.860
Not us. We cannot claim
credit for human ingenuity.

923
01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:57.460
But you had the key.
Why stay on this world?

924
01:15:57.460 --> 01:16:02.920
When Unicron destroyed our world, we took
an oath dedicated to the preservation of life.

925
01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:05.200
No matter the cost.

926
01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:07.800
And Earth has been a safe refuge.

927
01:16:47.100 --> 01:16:49.000
This is Amaru.

928
01:16:49.100 --> 01:16:52.100
He and his family are
the last descendants of a tribe

929
01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:55.700
that has watched
over us for hundreds of years.

930
01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:59.600
When we arrived,
they shared their world with us,

931
01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:02.600
and together we protected its people

932
01:17:02.900 --> 01:17:05.600
and our secret.

933
01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:14.600
You allied with humans?

934
01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:17.100
We did.

935
01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:24.800
If you give us this key, tomorrow I will
light the beacon and bring Scourge to us.

936
01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:29.400
The Maximals have already sacrificed
one home to protect the universe.

937
01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:31.600
I won't risk losing another.

938
01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:35.020
As a leader, I know you understand.

939
01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:02.560
He is not the Optimus Prime I imagined.

940
01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:06.320
Well, he has lost so much.

941
01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:11.220
Many more will perish
if the key falls into the wrong hands.

942
01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:17.320
If you had another chance to save
our home, would you act any differently?

943
01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:24.820
Optimus, come.
I want to show you something.

944
01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:31.720
Your friend will find peace here.

945
01:18:33.220 --> 01:18:35.920
This is raw energon.

946
01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:37.920
The valley is rich with it.

947
01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:40.120
Could this revive be?

948
01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:43.120
I'm sorry,
but in this state it is inert.

949
01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:46.120
It will take a great power to ignite it.

950
01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:49.120
Greater than anything we have here.

951
01:18:51.820 --> 01:18:55.120
I see that you are surprised
we entrust the key to them.

952
01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:57.120
Yes I am.

953
01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:00.020
I've been amongst them a long time now.

954
01:19:00.020 --> 01:19:03.240
There is more to them
than meets the eye.

955
01:19:03.340 --> 01:19:05.660
They are worth saving.

956
01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:42.300
What if we didn't destroy you?

957
01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:48.520
Maybe there's another way
to save both our homes.

958
01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:52.040
Alaina, I made a lot
of mistakes in my life.

959
01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:55.480
This is different.

960
01:19:57.580 --> 01:19:59.840
I can't fail at this.

961
01:20:00.540 --> 01:20:02.920
I can't let my family down.

962
01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:04.940
You're just like him.

963
01:20:04.940 --> 01:20:07.360
You know that? -Who?

964
01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:08.980
Optimus.

965
01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:11.920
I'm serious.

966
01:20:12.020 --> 01:20:13.400
He feels it too.

967
01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:15.120
Feels what?

968
01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:19.680
Like a beast of burden,
just trying to carry the weight

969
01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:22.560
of the world on his shoulders.

970
01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:28.340
You think he's some general
barking orders, but when I look at him,

971
01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:32.200
all I see is a big brother
trying to protect his family.

972
01:21:28.900 --> 01:21:30.440
Are you okay?

973
01:21:36.660 --> 01:21:38.200
Who is it?

974
01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:40.760
I can feel Scourge.

975
01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:44.420
He's in my mind.

976
01:21:54.620 --> 01:21:56.400
Run, Elena.

977
01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:00.840
No!

978
01:22:03.740 --> 01:22:05.580
Airazor.

979
01:22:06.780 --> 01:22:08.780
They found us.

980
01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:11.340
Everyone, defensive position.

981
01:22:11.940 --> 01:22:14.480
Noah, guard the key.

982
01:22:14.580 --> 01:22:17.320
Take Elena and find
someplace safe to hide.

983
01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:21.020
We must protect the humans.

984
01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:25.360
Miss me?

985
01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:27.800
Noah, Elena, get out of here!

986
01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:46.840
We have to destroy it.

987
01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:49.520
No.

988
01:22:49.820 --> 01:22:51.520
No.

989
01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:54.020
Don't.

990
01:22:56.700 --> 01:23:00.180
I know you want to protect your people.

991
01:23:00.180 --> 01:23:05.740
But if you destroy that key,
our home will be lost forever.

992
01:23:05.740 --> 01:23:08.420
We do not have to choose.

993
01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:16.880
Please, Noah.

994
01:23:34.680 --> 01:23:36.480
Elena!

995
01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:42.980
Go!

996
01:24:04.020 --> 01:24:05.900
Elena!

997
01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:14.200
Wait, wait, didn't I kill you already?

998
01:24:16.100 --> 01:24:19.820
No, I'm the Maximal that
is going to rip out your spark.

999
01:24:20.820 --> 01:24:22.840
We'll see about that.

1000
01:24:22.940 --> 01:24:24.780
Kill them.

1001
01:24:30.820 --> 01:24:32.420
There is a note!

1002
01:24:32.420 --> 01:24:35.240
I can't hold it back

1003
01:24:35.340 --> 01:24:37.640
much longer.

1004
01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:40.340
Fight it, Airazor.

1005
01:24:40.340 --> 01:24:42.340
Remember our oath,

1006
01:24:42.340 --> 01:24:43.940
primal.

1007
01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:46.340
No matter the cost.

1008
01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:48.340
I can't hold it back!

1009
01:24:48.340 --> 01:24:50.340
Airazor, no!

1010
01:25:01.340 --> 01:25:02.340
Pramel!

1011
01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:12.040
This is okay!

1012
01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:15.440
Do it!

1013
01:25:38.780 --> 01:25:40.780
Primal.

1014
01:25:41.780 --> 01:25:43.780
No matter the cost.

1015
01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:54.780
Alina, Alina, look at me.

1016
01:25:55.580 --> 01:25:57.380
Are you okay?

1017
01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:01.780
Scourge has the key.

1018
01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:48.380
Awaken, almighty Unicron.

1019
01:26:48.380 --> 01:26:50.800
Your time has come.

1020
01:27:53.700 --> 01:27:55.720
I'm sorry no.

1021
01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:59.320
We were looking out for your own.

1022
01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:03.320
I can't even be angry at you for that.

1023
01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:08.320
On my home world, we believe that
the battle with darkness will continue

1024
01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:10.720
 till all are won.

1025
01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:13.820
I lost sight of that.

1026
01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:17.420
You fought for yours
as I fought for mine, 

1027
01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:21.820
when we should have been
fighting the darkness together.

1028
01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:26.820
Well, I ain't done fighting yet.

1029
01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:33.920
All right, everybody, squad up.

1030
01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:35.920
Bring it in.

1031
01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:38.020
There's gotta be a way
to stop this dude.

1032
01:28:38.020 --> 01:28:39.420
It's too late.

1033
01:28:39.420 --> 01:28:41.920
The transwarp has
already been activated.

1034
01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:44.420
It has more energy than a supernova.

1035
01:28:44.420 --> 01:28:48.420
Any interruption
will ignite it, like a bomb.

1036
01:28:48.420 --> 01:28:50.420
The only way to stop this process

1037
01:28:50.420 --> 01:28:52.920
is an access code installed long ago

1038
01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:54.220
as a safeguard.

1039
01:28:54.220 --> 01:28:55.720
Okay, what's the code then?

1040
01:28:55.720 --> 01:28:58.220
The code was split along with a key.

1041
01:28:58.220 --> 01:29:02.420
Sadly, the second half
of that code died with Airazor.

1042
01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:04.120
No, wait, wait. I got it.

1043
01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:06.020
The one hiding her half of the key,

1044
01:29:06.020 --> 01:29:07.420
it had markings in it.

1045
01:29:07.420 --> 01:29:09.920
Just like the ones I found
on the cave where you hid yours.

1046
01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:13.420
Together, they must
complete the access code.

1047
01:29:14.020 --> 01:29:15.920
So we got a chance now, right?

1048
01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:17.520
A slim chance.

1049
01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:19.620
That is all we need.

1050
01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:23.020
If you will show us the way, Primal.

1051
01:29:24.820 --> 01:29:28.340
Alright, we need to move quickly.

1052
01:29:28.340 --> 01:29:32.700
We have a small window before the portal
opens large enough for Unicron to enter.

1053
01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:35.140
The bridge is girded
by a series of tunnels.

1054
01:29:35.140 --> 01:29:38.100
They are too small for Maximals, but...

1055
01:29:38.100 --> 01:29:40.000
But not for humans.

1056
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.900
If Noah and Elena
reach the central antenna,

1057
01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:48.100
they could use the code to shut
it down, remove the transwarp key,

1058
01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:52.080
and close the portal before
Unicron enters our atmosphere.

1059
01:29:52.180 --> 01:29:54.480
But Scourge will be
watching our every move.

1060
01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:56.980
He'll do anything to
stop us from getting the key.

1061
01:29:56.980 --> 01:29:58.980
Then we bring the fight to him.

1062
01:29:58.980 --> 01:30:03.980
Autobots and Maximals
will charge the bridge together

1063
01:30:03.980 --> 01:30:06.980
and lure Scourge onto the battlefield.

1064
01:30:06.980 --> 01:30:09.580
While me and Elena
sneak it through the back way.

1065
01:30:12.980 --> 01:30:15.780
It sounds like we are going to die.

1066
01:30:16.780 --> 01:30:20.980
If we are to die,
then we will die fighting.

1067
01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:22.980
All as one.

1068
01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:39.560
This world is yours, master.

1069
01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:42.160
Scourge...

1070
01:30:42.260 --> 01:30:44.260
They're back.

1071
01:30:50.460 --> 01:30:52.460
Prime.

1072
01:30:53.860 --> 01:30:58.260
Protect the king.
Don't let them get to the bridge.

1073
01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:23.120
Maximals! Autobots! Roll out!

1074
01:31:34.620 --> 01:31:37.840
Rhinox! Tior! Maximize!

1075
01:32:01.460 --> 01:32:04.460
At least the foot soldiers took the bait.
-Yeah, but Scourge didn't.

1076
01:32:04.460 --> 01:32:05.500
He's guarding the key.

1077
01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:06.980
All right.

1078
01:32:06.980 --> 01:32:09.660
This should lead to the bottom
of the transwarp control panel.

1079
01:32:09.660 --> 01:32:11.460
Get the key,
get the hell out of there.

1080
01:32:11.460 --> 01:32:13.340
What are you gonna do?

1081
01:32:13.340 --> 01:32:15.340
I'm gonna go distract Scourge.

1082
01:32:15.340 --> 01:32:16.980
You can't take on Scourge alone.

1083
01:32:16.980 --> 01:32:17.940
Relax.

1084
01:32:17.940 --> 01:32:20.260
I'm Mirage, remember?

1085
01:32:20.260 --> 01:32:21.900
Hey.

1086
01:32:56.860 --> 01:32:59.360
One, two, three, boom!

1087
01:33:02.660 --> 01:33:04.900
We gotta hurry up.

1088
01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:10.500
Take cover!

1089
01:33:10.500 --> 01:33:12.340
Get up!

1090
01:33:12.340 --> 01:33:14.740
Someone get me a real fight!

1091
01:33:16.540 --> 01:33:18.720
It's a fight you want?

1092
01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:20.520
You got one.

1093
01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:35.700
He was mine.

1094
01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:39.280
Nope.

1095
01:33:39.380 --> 01:33:41.360
Missed me.

1096
01:33:44.060 --> 01:33:46.520
Noah, get to the key! -Mirage.

1097
01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:49.440
What do we have here?

1098
01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:52.440
I let it go!

1099
01:33:56.040 --> 01:33:59.240
Brave, but futile.

1100
01:34:02.740 --> 01:34:05.240
Hey! Don't mess with my boy!

1101
01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:38.240
No one will remember
this pathetic planet.

1102
01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:42.340
And no one will remember you.

1103
01:34:45.940 --> 01:34:47.940
Mirage, what are you doing?

1104
01:34:47.940 --> 01:34:49.940
Keeping my promise.

1105
01:34:51.740 --> 01:34:55.140
Come on, you gotta get up!
-It's okay, Noah.

1106
01:34:59.940 --> 01:35:02.540
Home, home team.

1107
01:35:03.540 --> 01:35:05.540
Home team.

1108
01:35:12.940 --> 01:35:14.940
Mirage?

1109
01:35:17.940 --> 01:35:19.940
Mirage?

1110
01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:22.940
Kill the other human.

1111
01:35:59.580 --> 01:36:03.480
Unicron, you fought bravely,

1112
01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:08.080
but this world is already mine.

1113
01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:19.280
We are too late.

1114
01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:29.980
Go!

1115
01:36:50.020 --> 01:36:53.120
<i>Hey! Are you there?</i>

1116
01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:54.720
<i>Over.</i>

1117
01:36:54.900 --> 01:36:56.640
<i>Yo Sonic!</i>

1118
01:36:56.640 --> 01:36:58.940
Kris. <i>-Noah?</i>

1119
01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:01.400
What's going on?

1120
01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:03.240
Where's Mirage?

1121
01:37:03.340 --> 01:37:05.980
He... he's gone.

1122
01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:07.880
<i>Gone?</i>

1123
01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:13.300
No.

1124
01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:16.680
I'm sorry, Kris.

1125
01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:25.940
I'm not gonna win this one.

1126
01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:28.620
We don't lose, right?

1127
01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:32.200
I wish that was true, but I can't.

1128
01:37:39.100 --> 01:37:41.080
<i>Yes, you can.</i>

1129
01:37:42.580 --> 01:37:44.620
No.

1130
01:37:45.020 --> 01:37:47.360
No, I'm not you.

1131
01:37:47.660 --> 01:37:49.200
<i>I hate being sick.</i>

1132
01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:50.760
<i>Whenever I wanna give up,</i>

1133
01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:53.760
you're always there
telling me to keep going.

1134
01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:55.600
<i>And now it's my turn.</i>

1135
01:37:55.600 --> 01:37:57.440
Keep going, no?

1136
01:37:58.940 --> 01:38:03.620
<i>You think you're nobody,
but you're the strongest guy I know.</i>

1137
01:38:04.120 --> 01:38:06.120
You guys are so cute.

1138
01:38:06.620 --> 01:38:08.320
Mirage.

1139
01:38:08.420 --> 01:38:10.120
You're alive.

1140
01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:15.320
Yeah, but I'm gonna
need you to take the wheel.

1141
01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:28.120
<i>You can do this.</i>

1142
01:38:32.420 --> 01:38:35.420
<i>You're my brother.</i> Noah Diaz.

1143
01:38:35.620 --> 01:38:37.920
From Wilson Avenue.

1144
01:38:38.620 --> 01:38:41.120
<i>Apartment 2C Brooklyn, New York.</i>

1145
01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:46.520
No names over the airwaves.

1146
01:38:46.820 --> 01:38:48.820
Forget that.

1147
01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:51.120
Let them know who you are.

1148
01:38:54.820 --> 01:38:56.920
Yo Scourge!

1149
01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:03.320
Remember me?

1150
01:39:23.860 --> 01:39:27.600
You think you can take me on alone?

1151
01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:32.480
He is not alone.

1152
01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:20.760
I'm never leave Brooklyn again.

1153
01:40:34.100 --> 01:40:36.080
Energon.

1154
01:41:05.420 --> 01:41:07.020
Prime!

1155
01:41:09.420 --> 01:41:11.020
Noah!

1156
01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:31.400
I'm getting really tired of you humans.

1157
01:41:38.100 --> 01:41:40.280
I got you!

1158
01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:06.780
Bee!

1159
01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:12.560
You again.

1160
01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:14.960
You should have stayed dead!

1161
01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:39.560
I have come here to kick ass.

1162
01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:41.260
Glad to have you back.

1163
01:42:41.260 --> 01:42:45.560
Everyone, guard the bridge.
Elena, shut it down!

1164
01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:53.560
We gotta give her some cover!

1165
01:42:53.560 --> 01:42:55.560
We'll clear the way.

1166
01:42:58.160 --> 01:43:00.560
That's what I'm talking about.

1167
01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:03.860
Engine access code.
How hard could that be?

1168
01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:09.560
You've got to be kidding me.

1169
01:43:14.840 --> 01:43:17.060
Just you and me, Scourge!

1170
01:43:21.860 --> 01:43:25.280
Let's end this once and for all.

1171
01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:27.480
Master, the reinforcements!

1172
01:43:48.280 --> 01:43:49.880
All right, I got this.

1173
01:43:49.980 --> 01:43:51.580
Let's go, Bee!

1174
01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:01.580
Say hallo to my little friend!

1175
01:44:24.280 --> 01:44:26.280
We gotta hurry!

1176
01:44:26.780 --> 01:44:28.580
That's right.

1177
01:44:28.780 --> 01:44:32.080
Yeah, you ugly motherfucker!

1178
01:45:07.540 --> 01:45:11.340
You will never see
Unicron take this world!

1179
01:45:18.540 --> 01:45:21.040
You did it! Brooklyn baby!

1180
01:45:21.740 --> 01:45:23.540
No! 

1181
01:45:23.740 --> 01:45:26.340
Unicron will prevail!

1182
01:45:26.340 --> 01:45:28.140
Elena!

1183
01:45:31.020 --> 01:45:34.780
I've had enough!

1184
01:45:35.980 --> 01:45:39.760
Time to show you
the real power of the Prime!

1185
01:45:43.660 --> 01:45:46.760
This belongs to a friend of mine!

1186
01:45:59.420 --> 01:46:02.900
The panel is destroyed.

1187
01:46:03.900 --> 01:46:06.080
I can't stop it.

1188
01:46:06.580 --> 01:46:10.940
Autobots, Maximals, retreat to safety.

1189
01:46:10.940 --> 01:46:14.140
I will destroy the key myself.

1190
01:46:14.140 --> 01:46:17.120
Prime, no!
-There's got to be another way.

1191
01:46:17.140 --> 01:46:18.880
Bee, protect them.

1192
01:46:27.520 --> 01:46:30.960
Your sacrifice becomes our oath.

1193
01:46:32.060 --> 01:46:35.480
Thank you, my friends.

1194
01:46:40.580 --> 01:46:42.340
Bee!

1195
01:46:42.840 --> 01:46:45.280
We can't leave him out!

1196
01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:53.520
Everyone, on me!

1197
01:47:05.020 --> 01:47:09.700
Don't, Prime.
I can give you everything you want.

1198
01:47:09.940 --> 01:47:11.940
Then you die!

1199
01:47:49.820 --> 01:47:50.980
Noah?

1200
01:47:50.980 --> 01:47:52.680
I got you!

1201
01:48:03.460 --> 01:48:07.060
Let me go, Noah. Save yourself.

1202
01:48:08.360 --> 01:48:11.060
Till all are one.

1203
01:48:31.060 --> 01:48:33.260
Till all are one.

1204
01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:47.360
Punch it, Prime!

1205
01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:15.840
Yeah baby!

1206
01:49:46.140 --> 01:49:48.540
Unicron. Is he dead?

1207
01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:51.340
Trapped, but not dead.

1208
01:49:51.540 --> 01:49:55.340
Evil can never be
vanquished completely. 

1209
01:49:55.440 --> 01:49:57.240
He could return.

1210
01:49:57.340 --> 01:50:04.340
Let him come. United,
we will destroy him once and for all.

1211
01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:12.340
I am Optimus Prime,
leader of the Autobots.

1212
01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:18.640
We have lost the Transwarp Key
and with it our ability to go home.

1213
01:50:21.340 --> 01:50:27.560
But we have gained an ally
in our battle against the forces of evil.

1214
01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:33.080
Forces too powerful for
any of us to defeat on our own.

1215
01:50:33.180 --> 01:50:38.020
But together
we might just have a chance.

1216
01:50:46.620 --> 01:50:48.900
I am Noah Diaz.

1217
01:50:49.400 --> 01:50:52.180
What is there to know about me?

1218
01:50:52.180 --> 01:50:54.180
I was raised out in Brooklyn.

1219
01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:56.780
I got a little bro who calls me Sonic

1220
01:50:56.880 --> 01:51:00.580
and if I gotta help save the universe
in order to save the people I love,

1221
01:51:00.660 --> 01:51:03.320
well then that's what I'm gonna do.

1222
01:51:33.100 --> 01:51:35.200
How you doing, sir?

1223
01:51:35.300 --> 01:51:38.280
You here for the job
interview, Noah Diaz?

1224
01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:40.320
I'll tell him you're here.

1225
01:51:41.220 --> 01:51:43.280
<i>This Sunday on 60 Minutes,</i>

1226
01:51:43.280 --> 01:51:46.360
<i>I sit down to talk with Elena Wallace.</i>

1227
01:51:46.360 --> 01:51:49.200
<i>She recently discovered
an underground temple</i>

1228
01:51:49.200 --> 01:51:54.080
<i>with a network of catacombs
dating back to 5000 BC.</i>

1229
01:51:54.080 --> 01:51:55.920
<i>I never could have
imagined making a discovery</i>

1230
01:51:55.920 --> 01:51:57.880
<i>of this significance.</i>

1231
01:51:57.880 --> 01:52:00.500
<i>So it's definitely a dream come true.</i>

1232
01:52:01.500 --> 01:52:03.320
Brooklyn, baby.

1233
01:52:05.040 --> 01:52:08.080
They're ready for you.
-Thanks, sir. -Elevator in the back.

1234
01:52:12.700 --> 01:52:15.040
Why don't you tell me
about your strengths?

1235
01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:17.000
In addition to my
experience with electronics,

1236
01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:21.280
I've also been really developing
my team building skills too.

1237
01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:26.300
That's a... Look,
I'm gonna be honest with you.

1238
01:52:28.300 --> 01:52:29.920
Resume's a little thin.

1239
01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:32.440
Yeah, well, I just recently had a job.

1240
01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:35.520
Working internationally.

1241
01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:37.560
Oh, is that...

1242
01:52:38.560 --> 01:52:40.400
No, don't think it's on there.

1243
01:52:40.400 --> 01:52:43.740
No, it was a short-term contract.

1244
01:52:43.740 --> 01:52:46.280
Oh, well, that's cool.

1245
01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:48.800
Why don't you tell me about that?

1246
01:52:51.300 --> 01:52:53.800
It was in South America,

1247
01:52:53.800 --> 01:52:55.640
so I got to work on my Spanish.

1248
01:52:55.640 --> 01:52:57.800
But my mom was real happy about that.

1249
01:52:57.800 --> 01:53:00.480
You know moms, she's just been...

1250
01:53:00.480 --> 01:53:05.600
But while I was out there, honestly, man,
I was really just like, "work, work, work."

1251
01:53:05.980 --> 01:53:09.340
That's a shame, 'cause I heard
the food is really good in Peru.

1252
01:53:11.480 --> 01:53:14.360
I didn't mention anything about Peru.

1253
01:53:14.360 --> 01:53:16.360
Well, that's where you were, right?

1254
01:53:16.360 --> 01:53:18.680
I was... -Down in Cusco?

1255
01:53:18.680 --> 01:53:23.040
With you and Elena, and your...

1256
01:53:23.540 --> 01:53:26.740
I don't know, call 'em friends?

1257
01:53:31.400 --> 01:53:33.720
What's going on here?

1258
01:53:33.720 --> 01:53:35.720
We know a lot about you, Mr. Diaz.

1259
01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:39.200
Who are you, like the CIA or FBI?

1260
01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:42.360
We are a secret
government organization,

1261
01:53:42.360 --> 01:53:44.280
strictly off the books.

1262
01:53:44.280 --> 01:53:47.600
We specialize in global threats,
planetary, loss prevention,

1263
01:53:47.600 --> 01:53:49.520
that kind of thing.

1264
01:53:49.520 --> 01:53:52.200
We're in the middle of an ongoing war,

1265
01:53:52.200 --> 01:53:54.840
and we'd love to
have you join the fight.

1266
01:53:54.840 --> 01:54:00.820
You and your whole team.
You know... The big guys.

1267
01:54:00.920 --> 01:54:03.980
No idea what you're talking about.

1268
01:54:04.280 --> 01:54:06.080
That's a good answer.

1269
01:54:06.080 --> 01:54:07.640
All right.

1270
01:54:07.640 --> 01:54:10.440
Either way, I want you to know,

1271
01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:13.040
in lieu of the thanks
of a grateful nation,

1272
01:54:13.040 --> 01:54:16.040
we will be taking care
of your brother Kris's health care.

1273
01:54:16.040 --> 01:54:17.240
All of it.

1274
01:54:17.240 --> 01:54:21.340
From now on, he will have 24/7 access
to the greatest doctors in the world.

1275
01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:25.920
These are doctors who don't ask
their patients about account balances.

1276
01:54:30.680 --> 01:54:31.920
Are you serious?

1277
01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:34.720
You saved the world, kid.
It's the least we can do.

1278
01:54:34.800 --> 01:54:37.860
I don't know what to say.
-We'll work on that.

1279
01:54:39.400 --> 01:54:42.160
Your brother's gonna be just fine.

1280
01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:51.000
Oh, Kris was right, by the way.

1281
01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:03.160
No names over the airwaves. 

1282
01:55:04.260 --> 01:55:08.360
We could really use someone like you, Noah.
Why don't you think about it?

1283
01:55:30.520 --> 01:55:32.180
G.I. JOE

1284
01:56:12.860 --> 01:56:14.860
That oughta do it.

1285
01:56:17.060 --> 01:56:21.760
This? This is a complete waste
of your skills and my expertise.

1286
01:56:21.900 --> 01:56:24.500
Think it came out pretty good.

1287
01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
Well, I guess we could call it

1288
01:56:27.100 --> 01:56:29.800
 modern art and sell it
to some cats in Soho.

1289
01:56:29.900 --> 01:56:32.540
No, I'm not selling. -What?

1290
01:56:32.540 --> 01:56:34.480
Why?

1291
01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:37.320
Is this about the five-o' thing?

1292
01:56:37.420 --> 01:56:40.520
No, I told you. I did not ditch you.

1293
01:56:40.620 --> 01:56:43.220
I was running to give it go.
I thought you knew the play.

1294
01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:46.760
All right, let's say I did
ditch you, even though I didn't.

1295
01:56:46.760 --> 01:56:51.300
Not for your sake I see your face. Let's just say
I did I think all the blood sweat and dead presidents

1296
01:56:51.300 --> 01:56:56.140
I put in to get in these car parts 
for you make us even Steven. -It's not that.

1297
01:56:56.640 --> 01:56:58.600
This car is special.

1298
01:56:58.700 --> 01:57:02.100
This car is a jigsaw
puzzle made of garbage. 

1299
01:57:02.200 --> 01:57:06.840
Hey, I bet the joint don't even start.

1300
01:57:08.840 --> 01:57:10.800
Bet.

1301
01:57:11.300 --> 01:57:13.360
Yo, Mirage!

1302
01:57:22.400 --> 01:57:25.160
Woo hoo hoo, yeah!

1303
01:57:25.260 --> 01:57:27.400
Your boy is back!

1304
01:57:27.400 --> 01:57:30.440
This dude said
I wasn't even gonna start!
