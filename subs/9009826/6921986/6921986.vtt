00:22:06.698 --> 00:22:09.497
Um, Jake, Skeeter, this is
my boyfriend, Seth,

349
00:22:09.567 --> 00:22:11.296

350
00:22:11.369 --> 00:22:12.837
- [Skeeter and Billy] Boyfriend?
- Mm-hmm.

351
00:22:12.904 --> 00:22:15.874
Nice to meet you, Seth.
A, uh, future champion, I take it?

352
00:22:15.974 --> 00:22:18.568
Uh, yeah, I don't really know
what to say, Mr. Wind.

353
00:22:18.676 --> 00:22:21.145
- But yeah, I'm competing in Triple-S.
- <i>Hola, amigo.</i>

354
00:22:21.212 --> 00:22:22.873
Have I seen you on the water before?

355
00:22:22.981 --> 00:22:25.143
No. But definitely follow you, Skeeter.

356
00:22:25.216 --> 00:22:26.684
Oh, people call him Skeets.

357
00:22:26.751 --> 00:22:28.913
Yeah, chill, bro.
Call me Skeets. Stoked.

358
00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:30.317
I heard you were gonna throw a 900?

359
00:22:30.388 --> 00:22:31.856
Oh, boy knows his stuff.

360
00:22:31.923 --> 00:22:34.984
- Yeah. You got to spin it to win it.
- Just awesome.

361
00:22:35.059 --> 00:22:37.892
- Wait. You understand that?
- Yeah. Win. He wants to win.

362
00:22:37.996 --> 00:22:40.795
You guys going to the 2Chainz opener
tonight? Should be epic.

363
00:22:40.865 --> 00:22:43.493
- 2Chainz?
- Uh, yes, he's a close pal of ours.

364
00:22:43.568 --> 00:22:45.127
- No shit.
- Shit.

365
00:22:45.203 --> 00:22:48.468
- Impressive. Peeps in high places.
- Mm-hmm.

366
00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:52.238
Speak of the devil, there's Big Hair.
That's 2Chainz sound guy for tonight.

367
00:22:52.343 --> 00:22:54.835
Oh, my God! Big Hair!

368
00:22:54.913 --> 00:22:57.405
How are you? I'm Sky.

369
00:22:57.515 --> 00:23:01.383
I used to work with you and 2Chainz
and uh, just go along with it, okay?

370
00:23:01.486 --> 00:23:03.921
- [laughs]
- Mm, Sky. My lady.

371
00:23:04.022 --> 00:23:05.751
Sky, I didn't know you'd be here.

372
00:23:05.857 --> 00:23:07.222
You bringing it as always.

373
00:23:07.292 --> 00:23:09.886
Aw, you are so sweet.
Big Hair, meet Jake, Skeeter

374
00:23:09.961 --> 00:23:11.725
- and you remember Seth.
- Yeah, we know each other.

375
00:23:11.796 --> 00:23:12.957
- Glad you could make it, man.
- Yeah, man.

376
00:23:13.064 --> 00:23:14.463
Super-stoked for the show, man.

377
00:23:14.566 --> 00:23:16.534
Seth, man. Peace and love, man.

378
00:23:16.601 --> 00:23:18.399
I'm looking forward to seeing
you motherfuckers fly.

379
00:23:18.469 --> 00:23:19.732
- [laughter]
- Thefts what we do.

380
00:23:19.804 --> 00:23:22.398
Yeah, man, it's gonna be crazy.
Sky, don't be such a stranger.

381
00:23:22.473 --> 00:23:24.305
- You cool?
- Always.

382
00:23:24.409 --> 00:23:25.399
- All right.
- Oh...

383
00:23:25.476 --> 00:23:26.466
[whispers] Thank you.

384
00:23:26.578 --> 00:23:29.047
Bye. Good seeing you.

385
00:23:29.113 --> 00:23:30.274
Hello, gentlemen.

386
00:23:32.617 --> 00:23:34.142
Ah, Catherine.

387
00:23:34.252 --> 00:23:36.949
- Jake. Aw.
- Always a pleasure.

388
00:23:37.055 --> 00:23:39.547
Looks like we have
a very good field this year.

389
00:23:39.624 --> 00:23:42.423
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, and do tell.

390
00:23:42.527 --> 00:23:44.222
Who is this young one?

391
00:23:44.295 --> 00:23:45.956
Catherine, meet Seth.

392
00:23:46.064 --> 00:23:50.092
Mm. Seth. I am Miss DeLivia.

393
00:23:50.201 --> 00:23:53.102
Perhaps we can get to know
each other better this week?

394
00:23:54.939 --> 00:23:57.101
Maybe you want to give
the new kid a little break?

395
00:23:57.208 --> 00:23:59.370
No, Jakey. Why would I
ever do such a thing?

396
00:23:59.444 --> 00:24:01.572
- Well, I'll tell you why, you cougar.
- Sky, chill.

397
00:24:01.646 --> 00:24:03.080
No, do not ever tell me to chill.

398
00:24:03.147 --> 00:24:04.376
Oh, a mouth on this one, huh?

399
00:24:04.449 --> 00:24:06.076
- Hey, Uncle Jake.
- Yeah.

400
00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:07.242
Look at this.

401
00:24:08.519 --> 00:24:09.850
Oh, Seth, you're not on the board.

402
00:24:09.954 --> 00:24:12.480
Uh, yeah, well, my real name's Billy.
Billy Johnson Jr.

403
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:15.184
Alderic's here? You didn't tell me
that French dickhead was competing.

404
00:24:15.293 --> 00:24:17.990
I'll explain that later.
So which is it? Seth or Billy?

405
00:24:18.096 --> 00:24:21.430
Well, honestly, I don't really know
why she calls me Seth.

406
00:24:21.499 --> 00:24:23.092
We're not even together.

407
00:24:23.167 --> 00:24:24.328
We just met yesterday.

408
00:24:24.435 --> 00:24:25.994
Not a Billy Johnson here either.

409
00:24:26.104 --> 00:24:28.004
I'm afraid I'm not sure what to do here.

410
00:24:28.106 --> 00:24:30.336
Well, I got this.

411
00:24:32.443 --> 00:24:33.433
Oh, I see.

412
00:24:35.113 --> 00:24:38.242
Yeah, this is an invitation
to the Open. I'm sorry.

413
00:24:38.316 --> 00:24:40.444
Your registration's over there.

414
00:24:41.452 --> 00:24:43.284
[Skeeter] Man, you're an Open shredder?

415
00:24:43.354 --> 00:24:45.686
You have to win the Open in order
to participate in the Triple-S,

416
00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:46.848
but good luck.

417
00:24:46.958 --> 00:24:48.949
Hey, then he's going to win them both.

418
00:24:49.027 --> 00:24:52.520
Jake and you, Skeets, watch out
'cause my honey's ass is gonna Kick yours.

419
00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:54.257
I don't care what your name is.

420
00:24:54.332 --> 00:24:58.599
Trust that I'll be seeing
all of you real soon.

421
00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:01.469
For now, I will just be calling you
Honey Ass.

422
00:25:01.539 --> 00:25:03.473
[snorts] You just got served.

423
00:25:04.509 --> 00:25:06.603
Oops, I have got to run, boys.

424
00:25:06.678 --> 00:25:08.112
Massage time.

425
00:25:08.179 --> 00:25:10.307
[annoyed laugh]

426
00:25:10.381 --> 00:25:12.042
Will we be seeing you
at that 2Chainz concert later?

427
00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:16.018
No, darling. Those are not
the kind of chains enjoy.

428
00:25:16.087 --> 00:25:17.179
[laughs]

429
00:25:17.255 --> 00:25:18.245
[exhales sharply]

430
00:25:19.691 --> 00:25:22.217
I'm really sorry
for the misunderstanding, guys.

431
00:25:22.326 --> 00:25:24.055
- Sky, are you coming?
- Oh, no.

432
00:25:24.162 --> 00:25:26.392
[mockingly] Massage time. Duty calls.

433
00:25:26.497 --> 00:25:29.159
[scoffs] No, I'm gonna
hang out here. You go ahead.

434
00:25:29.233 --> 00:25:31.702
Whatever. I'm really sorry.

435
00:25:31.769 --> 00:25:33.203
Yeah. Whatever.

436
00:25:34.439 --> 00:25:36.168

I'm here because Eve,
my sponsor, say I must,

506

but, uh... I mean, look,
no competition here. Huh?

507
00:28:43.528 --> 00:28:45.223
Ugh. What an asswipe.

508
00:28:45.296 --> 00:28:47.025
Nonetheless, you are welcome.

Why don't you go butt-chug
a bottle of wine?

512
00:28:54.171 --> 00:28:55.900
Alderic will crush you.

513
00:28:56.007 --> 00:28:58.203
Hey, Alderic. No competition today.

514
00:28:58.276 --> 00:28:59.266
