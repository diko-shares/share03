2
00:01:06.105 --> 00:01:07.766
Turn it up!

3
00:01:29.795 --> 00:01:31.092
Go, Billy!

4
00:01:48.981 --> 00:01:52.474
- Coach, he's really good.
- Yeah, but Billy's better.

5
00:01:52.585 --> 00:01:55.020
At least without a kite.

6
00:03:17.203 --> 00:03:19.137
- Dude, you sent it.
- That was epic, my man.

7
00:03:19.205 --> 00:03:21.572
- Oh, thanks, guys.
- Billy, that was like super amazing.

8
00:03:21.674 --> 00:03:23.540
Like, really, I can't believe
all the tricks you can do.

9
00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:24.701
Thanks, Sasha.

10
00:03:24.777 --> 00:03:26.404
Bye-bye.

11
00:03:26.512 --> 00:03:28.105
- Thanks, guys.
- Hey, baby.

12
00:03:28.214 --> 00:03:29.545
Hey, Sarah, did you see my runs?

13
00:03:29.615 --> 00:03:33.415
Oh, no. Sorry.
I was on the phone with Daddy.

14
00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:34.611
I can't believe I hit that 540.

15
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.085
Yeah, pretty good. Pretty good.

16
00:03:36.188 --> 00:03:38.247
Pretty good? Ah, come on.

17
00:03:38.357 --> 00:03:40.018
Not good enough anymore, son.

18
00:03:40.092 --> 00:03:42.151
Needs to be a 720
for you to have a shot.

19
00:03:42.228 --> 00:03:43.855
A shot? What do you mean?

20
00:03:43.929 --> 00:03:46.227
Um, babe, can I talk to you like, pronto?

21
00:03:46.332 --> 00:03:49.029
540s just won't cut it.
Not now, not anymore.

22
00:03:49.101 --> 00:03:50.364
Gotta push it harder, son.

23
00:03:50.436 --> 00:03:51.801
Yeah, but what do you
mean if I have a shot?

24
00:03:51.904 --> 00:03:52.962
Uh, please, Billy?

25
00:03:53.072 --> 00:03:54.597
Wind Voyager Triple-S.

26
00:03:54.707 --> 00:03:56.573
- Yeah, right. I wish.
- Please, Billy,

27
00:03:56.642 --> 00:03:58.132
- I need to talk to you, okay?
- Sarah...

28
00:03:58.244 --> 00:03:59.575
He decides, Sarah.

29
00:03:59.645 --> 00:04:03.081
Look. You're the best on the board
that's ever come out of Hydrous,

30
00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:06.050
maybe even Texas, and you're even better
when you add a kite.

31
00:04:06.118 --> 00:04:09.748
So... we all chipped in...

32
00:04:11.957 --> 00:04:13.618
...and paid the entry fee.

33
00:04:13.726 --> 00:04:16.286
We signed you up for the Open bracket
for the Triple S.

34
00:04:18.597 --> 00:04:21.692
And here's another 500 bucks
to get you to Cape Hatteras.

35
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.760
This is your shot.

36
00:04:26.906 --> 00:04:28.601
- You did this for me?
- No, no, no.

37
00:04:28.674 --> 00:04:30.164
All of us did, Billy. Right?

38
00:04:31.911 --> 00:04:34.642
- We're your family.
- Put us on the map, Billy.

39
00:04:34.747 --> 00:04:37.739
I really appreciate this, guys.
This is so epic.

40
00:04:37.817 --> 00:04:39.444
I won't let you down.

41
00:04:39.552 --> 00:04:42.044
Babe? We need to talk. Right now.

42
00:04:42.121 --> 00:04:43.816
- Sarah...
- Ooh.

43
00:04:43.923 --> 00:04:46.324
- See the world, Billy.
- Oof.

44
00:04:47.326 --> 00:04:49.260
- Hey!
- Sarah, what is wrong with you?

45
00:04:49.328 --> 00:04:50.989
- What are you doing?
- Cape Hatteras?

46
00:04:51.096 --> 00:04:52.120
The Outer Banks”? Really?

47
00:04:53.132 --> 00:04:56.033
Babe, you're 22 years old.

48
00:04:56.135 --> 00:04:58.365
It's a little late to go down this path,
don't you think?

49
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.495
Where are you gonna get
with kiting anyways?

50
00:05:00.606 --> 00:05:02.301
It's not like you can make
a real career out of it.

51
00:05:04.543 --> 00:05:07.945
I talked to Daddy.
He said the offer still stands.

52
00:05:08.013 --> 00:05:11.244
You did not. Uh-uh, not a chance.
I already said no.

53
00:05:11.317 --> 00:05:13.843
- He forgives you.
- Forgives <i>me?</i>

54
00:05:13.953 --> 00:05:16.445
Babe, this is a real career.

55
00:05:16.522 --> 00:05:19.787
You can start your way out in the factory,
work your way up to management.

56
00:05:19.859 --> 00:05:20.985
Who knows? In a few years,

57
00:05:21.093 --> 00:05:24.290
you could be the youngest VP
in the whole company.

58
00:05:24.363 --> 00:05:26.957
Selling batteries? Sarah,
you can't be serious.

59
00:05:27.032 --> 00:05:30.559
We can stay here and start the life
that we've always wanted, Billy.

60
00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:33.832
No, Sarah, this is the life
that <i>you</i> have always wanted.

61
00:05:35.741 --> 00:05:38.335
You need to grow up and be a man.

62
00:05:39.712 --> 00:05:41.009
I'm out.

63
00:05:42.781 --> 00:05:44.613
Billy...

64
00:05:44.683 --> 00:05:47.175
- Where you going?
- Getting my 540 to a 720.

65
00:05:47.286 --> 00:05:49.482
Don't you walk away from me,
Billy Johnson.

66
00:05:49.555 --> 00:05:51.353
This whole kiteboarding thing?

67
00:05:51.457 --> 00:05:54.017
It's stupid. It is ridiculous.

68
00:05:54.126 --> 00:05:58.393
So stupid, there is no future in it
whatsoever, and you know what?

69
00:05:58.497 --> 00:06:00.898
If you walk away, we are done.

70
00:06:02.334 --> 00:06:04.166
Officially done.

71
00:06:11.577 --> 00:06:13.238
This is all your fault.

72
00:06:13.345 --> 00:06:15.177
You know that? Hmm?

73
00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.050
Oh!

74
00:06:30.429 --> 00:06:31.863
Boom.

75
00:07:01.427 --> 00:07:05.796
Nope. You need to suffer
a little bit more.

76
00:07:08.334 --> 00:07:11.304
<i>It's Sarah.
I'm not free, but apparently you are.</i>

77
00:07:55.514 --> 00:07:57.312
Hey, Coach.

78
00:07:57.416 --> 00:07:59.908
I got the seven,
nine, ten, 12, 14 meters.

79
00:07:59.985 --> 00:08:02.511
I've got the boards, fins, harness,
leashes, bars.

80
00:08:02.621 --> 00:08:05.056
Hey, Dixie. How are you, baby?

81
00:08:05.157 --> 00:08:06.556
What am I missing?

82
00:08:06.658 --> 00:08:08.057
You'll need these.

83
00:08:10.329 --> 00:08:12.388
Oh, man. These are the best earphones.

84
00:08:13.499 --> 00:08:18.130
And Sasha put a bunch of music
somehow on this thing.

85
00:08:18.203 --> 00:08:20.035
Oh, yeah. My playlist.

86
00:08:20.139 --> 00:08:23.336
I spent a lot of hours practicing to this.
Thanks, Coach.

87
00:08:24.943 --> 00:08:26.342
Are you sure you don't want to come?

88
00:08:26.445 --> 00:08:29.608
What, and leave all this?
No, young man, I can't.

89
00:08:30.783 --> 00:08:34.583
- Sarah not going?
- Uh, nah.

90
00:08:34.686 --> 00:08:37.417
No, it's all right.
Gives me more time to focus, you know?

91
00:08:37.523 --> 00:08:38.354
Hmm.

92
00:08:38.424 --> 00:08:40.518
- Only 21 hours to Hatteras, right?
- Yeah.

93
00:08:41.527 --> 00:08:43.495
Things happen
for a reason sometimes, Billy.

94
00:08:44.696 --> 00:08:46.357
- Yeah, I suppose.
- Yeah.

95
00:08:47.866 --> 00:08:49.561
Look, Coach, I just...

96
00:08:50.736 --> 00:08:52.261
I want to thank you
for all that you've done for me.

97
00:08:52.371 --> 00:08:53.600
- Stop it.
- No, I'm serious.

98
00:08:53.705 --> 00:08:54.934
No, no, no. Enough.

99
00:08:56.175 --> 00:08:58.906
Billy, I loved your mom and dad.

100
00:08:59.011 --> 00:09:01.878
They were like family.
It's what families do, right?

101
00:09:03.549 --> 00:09:04.380
So...

102
00:09:05.384 --> 00:09:08.979
I would like you to do
one thing for me out there in this world.

103
00:09:09.054 --> 00:09:11.216
Yes, sir. Anything.

104
00:09:13.025 --> 00:09:16.051
Be good to people. Pay it forward.

105
00:09:17.996 --> 00:09:20.397
Yes, sir. I will.

106
00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.492
Thanks, Coach.

107
00:10:44.449 --> 00:10:45.439
Hmm.

108
00:10:56.795 --> 00:10:58.695
I can't do this now.

109
00:11:00.966 --> 00:11:04.527
Really? Wow, Billy.

110
00:11:08.273 --> 00:11:09.968
Oh, man.

111
00:11:32.297 --> 00:11:35.699
- How much today, babe?
- $3.95, hon.

112
00:11:35.801 --> 00:11:39.032
- Just keep it.
- Thank you, see you tomorrow.

113
00:11:39.104 --> 00:11:41.596
Um, excuse me.
Where's the restroom?

114
00:11:41.707 --> 00:11:44.938
- Straight down that way.
- Thanks.

115
00:11:52.284 --> 00:11:53.547
- Hi there.
- Yeah?

116
00:11:53.619 --> 00:11:57.852
Uh, okay. I just need $40 of gas, please.

117
00:12:02.027 --> 00:12:05.588
- Ah, shit. Johnny! Got a runner!
- Back alley.

118
00:12:05.697 --> 00:12:07.631
Wait, what's going on?
Is everything okay?

119
00:12:07.733 --> 00:12:09.030
Whore done run the check.

120
00:12:15.374 --> 00:12:17.570
Well, it's gonna cost you
a lot more now, bitch.

121
00:12:17.676 --> 00:12:19.075
I can handle this, dickhead.

122
00:12:19.177 --> 00:12:21.612
- Ooh. Spicy.
- Get away from me.

123
00:12:21.713 --> 00:12:24.011
No, you've been asking
for this all afternoon.

124
00:12:24.082 --> 00:12:25.516
Yeah, you have.

125
00:12:25.584 --> 00:12:27.848
Dream on, you fucking freaks.

126
00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.752
Johnny, don't let this whore
talk to us like that.

127
00:12:29.855 --> 00:12:32.256
Yeah, this is gonna be fun.

128
00:12:32.357 --> 00:12:33.449
Come here.

129
00:12:33.558 --> 00:12:35.287
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Okay. Maybe...

130
00:12:35.394 --> 00:12:36.919
maybe we could come
to some sort of arrangement.

131
00:12:37.029 --> 00:12:40.090
Johnny, I think
we has us something here.

132
00:12:40.198 --> 00:12:41.165
Wait, she didn't pay?

133
00:12:41.266 --> 00:12:43.598
No, and we don't need
her sort around here.

134
00:12:43.669 --> 00:12:46.502
- Well, how much does she owe?
- Twelve dollars.

135
00:12:46.605 --> 00:12:50.735
Okay, um, here's the 40 for my gas.

136
00:12:53.745 --> 00:12:56.840
No! Stop! Please!

137
00:12:57.849 --> 00:12:59.112
Hey! Hey!

138
00:13:00.118 --> 00:13:01.244
What are you doing? Stop it!

139
00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:02.685
This ain't none of your business, boy.

140
00:13:02.788 --> 00:13:04.347
You best mind your own
and get on down the road.

141
00:13:04.456 --> 00:13:06.322
Leave her alone.
You can't go treating people this way.

142
00:13:06.425 --> 00:13:07.654
Look, just...

143
00:13:07.759 --> 00:13:09.488
just take it, okay?

144
00:13:09.594 --> 00:13:11.153
It-it covers everything plus some.

145
00:13:11.263 --> 00:13:13.391
You're sweet
on that bitch, ain't ya?

146
00:13:13.465 --> 00:13:16.093
That's a lot of money, boy.
How much you got there, huh?

147
00:13:16.168 --> 00:13:18.296
- Are we done here?
- Nah, oh, no.

148
00:13:18.403 --> 00:13:19.427
Don't think so.

149
00:13:19.504 --> 00:13:21.097
Look, I don't want
any trouble here, okay?

150
00:13:21.173 --> 00:13:22.937
It's too late for that, boy.
Give me that money.

151
00:13:23.008 --> 00:13:24.669
I warned you.
I don't want any trouble.

152
00:13:24.776 --> 00:13:27.905
Warned us? Didn't you tell him
to give us that money?

153
00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:29.641
I sure did.

154
00:13:29.748 --> 00:13:31.842
I'm afraid this ain't
gonna be your day, boy.

155
00:13:35.087 --> 00:13:36.486
Back off!

156
00:13:36.588 --> 00:13:38.579
You're gonna fucking break it.

157
00:13:38.657 --> 00:13:39.488
Give me my 20 back.

158
00:13:39.591 --> 00:13:40.820
Come on, Johnny.

159
00:13:40.926 --> 00:13:43.554
- Just do it.
- Get on the ground.

160
00:13:43.662 --> 00:13:45.562
- Just do it!
- Get on the ground.

161
00:13:45.664 --> 00:13:47.564
Hands behind your head.
Lay on your stomach.

162
00:13:51.303 --> 00:13:54.170
- Are we done? What?
- Yes. Yes!

163
00:13:54.239 --> 00:13:55.866
Your glenoid is the cartilage
in your shoulder.

164
00:13:55.974 --> 00:13:57.203
It's gonna take a few days to heal.

165
00:14:00.012 --> 00:14:01.707
Get off me!

166
00:14:10.489 --> 00:14:13.925
- Keep moving.
- You missing something?

167
00:14:14.025 --> 00:14:17.188
- Leave me alone.
- Is this yours?

168
00:14:17.295 --> 00:14:19.195
I said drive on, pew.

169
00:14:19.297 --> 00:14:21.356
Hey! This <i>is</i> yours.

170
00:14:23.068 --> 00:14:26.629
Oh, it's you. And yeah, that's mine.

171
00:14:26.705 --> 00:14:29.072
Well, aren't you welcome?
So where you headed?

172
00:14:29.174 --> 00:14:30.642
Everywhere.

173
00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:34.338
Okay. Well, I'm headed to North Carolina.

174
00:14:34.412 --> 00:14:35.641
Yeah. No, thanks.

175
00:14:35.714 --> 00:14:36.738
I didn't offer you a ride.

176
00:14:36.848 --> 00:14:38.873
Yet, and you will.

177
00:14:40.085 --> 00:14:43.248
So you're just gonna walk to...
everywhere?

178
00:14:43.355 --> 00:14:46.882
Look, I just need a ride to the next town,
and let me set you straight...

179
00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.518
no blowjobs, no handjobs
and no touching.

180
00:14:49.594 --> 00:14:51.289
Okay? Just a ride.

181
00:14:51.396 --> 00:14:53.592
Wrong guy. I'm not
interested in any of that.

182
00:14:53.698 --> 00:14:55.029
Yeah. Right.

183
00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.569
All right. Suit yourself.

184
00:14:57.636 --> 00:15:00.435
Hey, wait, please, please.
I just need a ride, okay?

185
00:15:00.539 --> 00:15:01.870
It's been a really bad day.

186
00:15:02.874 --> 00:15:04.399
Yeah. Tell me about it.

187
00:15:04.476 --> 00:15:07.446
All right. Hop in.

188
00:15:21.927 --> 00:15:24.953
So, um, where are you from anyway?

189
00:15:26.364 --> 00:15:28.059
Can we just not talk?

190
00:15:28.133 --> 00:15:31.103
I need rest. Please, just... quiet.

191
00:16:34.332 --> 00:16:37.427
What the hell?

192
00:16:39.104 --> 00:16:40.003
Where are we?

193
00:16:40.105 --> 00:16:42.665
OBX. Outer Banks.

194
00:16:42.774 --> 00:16:44.606
Best wind in the country.

195
00:16:44.676 --> 00:16:47.771
- Wind?
- You'll see.

196
00:16:52.417 --> 00:16:53.475
So what's your name, anyway?

197
00:16:53.552 --> 00:16:55.748
Skyler Sinclair,

198
00:16:55.854 --> 00:16:58.221
but most people call me Sky.

199
00:17:00.025 --> 00:17:04.019
Thanks for letting me sleep.
I feel so much better.

200
00:17:04.095 --> 00:17:09.261
And, um, I guess I should say thanks
for helping me out back there.

201
00:17:09.367 --> 00:17:12.064
That your real name? Skyler?

202
00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:13.433
Mm-hmm.

203
00:17:13.538 --> 00:17:14.903
Billy Johnson, Jr.

204
00:17:15.006 --> 00:17:17.100
- Sorry. Say what?
- My name.

205
00:17:17.208 --> 00:17:19.768
Well, I didn't ask.

206
00:17:19.878 --> 00:17:21.573
Really? You going there?

207
00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.580
Yeah.

208
00:17:23.682 --> 00:17:26.583
I'm just kidding. You don't really
look like a Billy.

209
00:17:26.685 --> 00:17:27.743
Sorry. Say what?

210
00:17:27.852 --> 00:17:29.581
You look like a Seth.

211
00:17:29.688 --> 00:17:33.181
- Yeah. Surfer Seth.
- Hey!

212
00:17:33.258 --> 00:17:35.192
Nope. I'm a Billy.

213
00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:36.887
I'm Billy and I kite.

214
00:17:36.995 --> 00:17:39.726
You some kind of pervert?
You play with kites?

215
00:17:39.831 --> 00:17:42.061
No, not those kind of kites.

216
00:17:42.167 --> 00:17:43.362
Okay? And I'm not a pervert.

217
00:17:45.837 --> 00:17:47.202
Oh, no way.

218
00:17:56.281 --> 00:17:57.749
Come on. I need you to take my picture.

219
00:17:57.816 --> 00:17:59.477
- Oh, 'kay.
- Be sure to get the sign.

220
00:17:59.584 --> 00:18:02.212
Okay. Oh.
Looking good.

221
00:18:02.287 --> 00:18:04.312
- Okay, now get on the ground.
- Okay.

222
00:18:04.422 --> 00:18:06.254
I like this a lot.

223
00:18:06.324 --> 00:18:07.416
Now get behind the sign.

224
00:18:07.492 --> 00:18:08.789
Good call.

225
00:18:11.162 --> 00:18:13.096
Ooh. Okay. Now you're getting creative.

226
00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:16.465
I got it.

227
00:18:16.568 --> 00:18:19.230
Ooh, a Sarah's calling.

228
00:18:19.304 --> 00:18:21.432
- Hey, give that back.
- Who is she? Should I answer?

229
00:18:21.506 --> 00:18:23.338
- No. Definitely not.
- Oh, my God.

230
00:18:23.441 --> 00:18:25.034
She's not right for you.
That's obvious.

231
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:27.579
- Now!
- Dude, she called twice

232
00:18:27.646 --> 00:18:29.705
and texted, like, five times.

233
00:18:29.781 --> 00:18:31.772
- Oh, oh, oh! Another one.
- Stop.

234
00:18:31.883 --> 00:18:33.874
Give me my phone.

235
00:18:33.952 --> 00:18:36.444
"I just called again.
Why won't you call me back?"

236
00:18:36.554 --> 00:18:38.545
- Enough, Sky.
- Want me to respond?

237
00:18:38.623 --> 00:18:39.488
No.

238
00:18:39.591 --> 00:18:42.583
Ooh, "Now I'm pissed off."
She sent the finger emoji?

239
00:18:42.661 --> 00:18:43.890
Yeah, Seth, she ain't happy.

240
00:18:43.962 --> 00:18:44.986
Give me my phone.

241
00:18:47.065 --> 00:18:48.624
Damn. I was just messing with you.

242
00:18:53.972 --> 00:18:56.964
So is she your gal?

243
00:18:57.042 --> 00:18:58.669
Did you dump her or something?

244
00:18:58.777 --> 00:19:01.041
Come on.

245
00:19:01.146 --> 00:19:03.308
Fine. Crabby.

246
00:20:18.857 --> 00:20:19.949
Come on.

247
00:20:23.428 --> 00:20:25.226
These are the kites I play with.

248
00:20:28.433 --> 00:20:29.832
What the hell?

249
00:20:34.572 --> 00:20:37.098
Here. Take better care of this.

250
00:20:39.377 --> 00:20:42.108
You look happy, Seth.

251
00:20:42.213 --> 00:20:44.045
Yeah. I'm competing.

252
00:20:44.115 --> 00:20:45.913
Super Bowl of kiteboarding.

253
00:20:46.017 --> 00:20:48.042
The biggest pro-tournament in America.

254
00:20:48.119 --> 00:20:51.419
That guy over there?
He's the best hope for American kiters.

255
00:20:51.523 --> 00:20:53.753
- He have a name?
- Skeeter Bowman.

256
00:20:53.858 --> 00:20:55.792
Jake, my man.

257
00:20:55.894 --> 00:20:57.919
Shit, Skeet. You scared
the shit out of me.

258
00:20:58.029 --> 00:21:00.054
- How are you doing?
- Oh, are we gonna do this?

259
00:21:00.131 --> 00:21:02.225
We? You're gonna do this, baby.

260
00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:04.769
- That's what I like to hear.
- Look at this.

261
00:21:04.836 --> 00:21:06.668
It keeps getting bigger every year.
Can you believe it?

262
00:21:06.771 --> 00:21:08.261
Yeah, man. Gonna rip it up.

263
00:21:08.339 --> 00:21:10.171
It's gonna be an amazing week.

264
00:21:10.275 --> 00:21:12.300
That's Jake Wind.
He owns Wind Voyager.

265
00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:15.175
Huge sponsor.
Skeeter rides for Jake.

266
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.509
Who are they?

267
00:21:16.614 --> 00:21:18.844
Just the best professional riders
on the planet.

268
00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:20.975
Ooh. Don't be nervous.
You need to chill.

269
00:21:21.086 --> 00:21:22.747
Chill? Really?

270
00:21:22.821 --> 00:21:25.347
- Yeah. I got this.
- What are you talking about?

271
00:21:25.457 --> 00:21:27.357
You know they breathe
the same air as us.

272
00:21:27.459 --> 00:21:29.621
- I mean, let's go meet them.
- No, no. Not gonna happen.

273
00:21:29.694 --> 00:21:32.220
- Maybe not for you.
- Sky, no!

274
00:21:32.297 --> 00:21:34.061
Uh, hey, guys. Hey there.

275
00:21:34.132 --> 00:21:36.794
- What a beautiful day. I'm Sky.
- Yeah, you are.

276
00:21:36.901 --> 00:21:38.494
- I'm Jake. Jake Wind.
- Hey.

277
00:21:38.603 --> 00:21:39.798
I'm Skeeter. They call me Skeets.

278
00:21:39.904 --> 00:21:41.303
- I'm a hugger.
- Oh, me too.

279
00:21:42.607 --> 00:21:46.100
Sorry, Uncle Jake, she barged right in.
Registration is over there.

280
00:21:46.177 --> 00:21:48.077
Uh, yeah, you're
the Wind Voyager Jake, right?

281
00:21:48.146 --> 00:21:51.912
Right. Uh, this is Aubrey,
my over-protective niece.

282
00:21:51.983 --> 00:21:54.680
- Do I know you?
- Well, you do now.

283
00:21:54.786 --> 00:21:56.254
Ha. I guess I do.

284
00:21:56.321 --> 00:21:57.846
Uh, hey, Johnson!

285
00:21:57.956 --> 00:22:00.254
Seth! Come on. Come over here.

286
00:22:00.325 --> 00:22:02.191
Oh, sorry. He's a little nervous.

287
00:22:02.293 --> 00:22:03.692
Seth, come on over here.

288
00:22:03.795 --> 00:22:05.524
Come on. I want you
to meet my new friends.

289
00:22:06.698 --> 00:22:09.497
Um, Jake, Skeeter, this is
my boyfriend, Seth,

290
00:22:09.567 --> 00:22:11.296
and he's going to win your S tournament.

291
00:22:11.369 --> 00:22:12.837
- Boyfriend?
- Mm-hmm.

292
00:22:12.904 --> 00:22:15.874
Nice to meet you, Seth.
A, uh, future champion, I take it?

293
00:22:15.974 --> 00:22:18.568
Uh, yeah, I don't really know
what to say, Mr. Wind.

294
00:22:18.676 --> 00:22:21.145
- But yeah, I'm competing in Triple-S.
- <i>Hola, amigo.</i>

295
00:22:21.212 --> 00:22:22.873
Have I seen you on the water before?

296
00:22:22.981 --> 00:22:25.143
No. But definitely follow you, Skeeter.

297
00:22:25.216 --> 00:22:26.684
Oh, people call him Skeets.

298
00:22:26.751 --> 00:22:28.913
Yeah, chill, bro.
Call me Skeets. Stoked.

299
00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:30.317
I heard you were gonna throw a 900?

300
00:22:30.388 --> 00:22:31.856
Oh, boy knows his stuff.

301
00:22:31.923 --> 00:22:34.984
- Yeah. You got to spin it to win it.
- Just awesome.

302
00:22:35.059 --> 00:22:37.892
- Wait. You understand that?
- Yeah. Win. He wants to win.

303
00:22:37.996 --> 00:22:40.795
You guys going to the 2Chainz opener
tonight? Should be epic.

304
00:22:40.865 --> 00:22:43.493
- 2Chainz?
- Uh, yes, he's a close pal of ours.

305
00:22:43.568 --> 00:22:45.127
- No shit.
- Shit.

306
00:22:45.203 --> 00:22:48.468
- Impressive. Peeps in high places.
- Mm-hmm.

307
00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:52.238
Speak of the devil, there's Big Hair.
That's 2Chainz sound guy for tonight.

308
00:22:52.343 --> 00:22:54.835
Oh, my God! Big Hair!

309
00:22:54.913 --> 00:22:57.405
How are you? I'm Sky.

310
00:22:57.515 --> 00:23:01.383
I used to work with you and 2Chainz
and uh, just go along with it, okay?

311
00:23:01.486 --> 00:23:03.921
Mm, Sky. My lady.

312
00:23:04.022 --> 00:23:05.751
Sky, I didn't know you'd be here.

313
00:23:05.857 --> 00:23:07.222
You bringing it as always.

314
00:23:07.292 --> 00:23:09.886
Aw, you are so sweet.
Big Hair, meet Jake, Skeeter

315
00:23:09.961 --> 00:23:11.725
- and you remember Seth.
- Yeah, we know each other.

316
00:23:11.796 --> 00:23:12.957
- Glad you could make it, man.
- Yeah, man.

317
00:23:13.064 --> 00:23:14.463
Super-stoked for the show, man.

318
00:23:14.566 --> 00:23:16.534
Seth, man. Peace and love, man.

319
00:23:16.601 --> 00:23:18.399
I'm looking forward to seeing
you motherfuckers fly.

320
00:23:18.469 --> 00:23:19.732
Thefts what we do.

321
00:23:19.804 --> 00:23:22.398
Yeah, man, it's gonna be crazy.
Sky, don't be such a stranger.

322
00:23:22.473 --> 00:23:24.305
- You cool?
- Always.

323
00:23:24.409 --> 00:23:25.399
- All right.
- Oh...

324
00:23:25.476 --> 00:23:26.466
Thank you.

325
00:23:26.578 --> 00:23:29.047
Bye. Good seeing you.

326
00:23:29.113 --> 00:23:30.274
Hello, gentlemen.

327
00:23:32.617 --> 00:23:34.142
Ah, Catherine.

328
00:23:34.252 --> 00:23:36.949
- Jake. Aw.
- Always a pleasure.

329
00:23:37.055 --> 00:23:39.547
Looks like we have
a very good field this year.

330
00:23:39.624 --> 00:23:42.423
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, and do tell.

331
00:23:42.527 --> 00:23:44.222
Who is this young one?

332
00:23:44.295 --> 00:23:45.956
Catherine, meet Seth.

333
00:23:46.064 --> 00:23:50.092
Mm. Seth. I am Miss DeLivia.

334
00:23:50.201 --> 00:23:53.102
Perhaps we can get to know
each other better this week?

335
00:23:54.939 --> 00:23:57.101
Maybe you want to give
the new kid a little break?

336
00:23:57.208 --> 00:23:59.370
No, Jakey. Why would I
ever do such a thing?

337
00:23:59.444 --> 00:24:01.572
- Well, I'll tell you why, you cougar.
- Sky, chill.

338
00:24:01.646 --> 00:24:03.080
No, do not ever tell me to chill.

339
00:24:03.147 --> 00:24:04.376
Oh, a mouth on this one, huh?

340
00:24:04.449 --> 00:24:06.076
- Hey, Uncle Jake.
- Yeah.

341
00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:07.242
Look at this.

342
00:24:08.519 --> 00:24:09.850
Oh, Seth, you're not on the board.

343
00:24:09.954 --> 00:24:12.480
Uh, yeah, well, my real name's Billy.
Billy Johnson Jr.

344
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:15.184
Alderic's here? You didn't tell me
that French dickhead was competing.

345
00:24:15.293 --> 00:24:17.990
I'll explain that later.
So which is it? Seth or Billy?

346
00:24:18.096 --> 00:24:21.430
Well, honestly, I don't really know
why she calls me Seth.

347
00:24:21.499 --> 00:24:23.092
We're not even together.

348
00:24:23.167 --> 00:24:24.328
We just met yesterday.

349
00:24:24.435 --> 00:24:25.994
Not a Billy Johnson here either.

350
00:24:26.104 --> 00:24:28.004
I'm afraid I'm not sure what to do here.

351
00:24:28.106 --> 00:24:30.336
Well, I got this.

352
00:24:32.443 --> 00:24:33.433
Oh, I see.

353
00:24:35.113 --> 00:24:38.242
Yeah, this is an invitation
to the Open. I'm sorry.

354
00:24:38.316 --> 00:24:40.444
Your registration's over there.

355
00:24:41.452 --> 00:24:43.284
Man, you're an Open shredder?

356
00:24:43.354 --> 00:24:45.686
You have to win the Open in order
to participate in the Triple-S,

357
00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:46.848
but good luck.

358
00:24:46.958 --> 00:24:48.949
Hey, then he's going to win them both.

359
00:24:49.027 --> 00:24:52.520
Jake and you, Skeets, watch out
'cause my honey's ass is gonna Kick yours.

360
00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:54.257
I don't care what your name is.

361
00:24:54.332 --> 00:24:58.599
Trust that I'll be seeing
all of you real soon.

362
00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:01.469
For now, I will just be calling you
Honey Ass.

363
00:25:01.539 --> 00:25:03.473
You just got served.

364
00:25:04.509 --> 00:25:06.603
Oops, I have got to run, boys.

365
00:25:06.678 --> 00:25:08.112
Massage time.

366
00:25:10.381 --> 00:25:12.042
Will we be seeing you
at that 2Chainz concert later?

367
00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:16.018
No, darling. Those are not
the kind of chains enjoy.

368
00:25:19.691 --> 00:25:22.217
I'm really sorry
for the misunderstanding, guys.

369
00:25:22.326 --> 00:25:24.055
- Sky, are you coming?
- Oh, no.

370
00:25:24.162 --> 00:25:26.392
Massage time. Duty calls.

371
00:25:26.497 --> 00:25:29.159
No, I'm gonna
hang out here. You go ahead.

372
00:25:29.233 --> 00:25:31.702
Whatever. I'm really sorry.

373
00:25:31.769 --> 00:25:33.203
Yeah. Whatever.

374
00:25:38.543 --> 00:25:41.137
Hey, hey. Thanks for your support.

375
00:25:44.582 --> 00:25:47.677
<i>Tony Smith here

- I'll be back for your order in a sec.
- Yeah.

385
00:26:11.976 --> 00:26:13.239
How are you guys doing?

386
00:26:13.311 --> 00:26:14.904
- Good.
- Good? Awesome.

387
00:26:14.979 --> 00:26:16.811
- Are you guys doing okay?
- We're good, thanks.

388
00:26:16.914 --> 00:26:18.382
Okay. Great.

389
00:26:18.449 --> 00:26:20.213
Welcome to Hydrous, can I take...

390
00:26:20.284 --> 00:26:24.778
- Oh, you...
- Well, hello there, Sasha.

391
00:26:24.889 --> 00:26:27.824
Like, slinging beers now, are we?

392
00:26:27.925 --> 00:26:30.451
Hmm. Welcome to Hydrous.

393
00:26:30.561 --> 00:26:31.960
Would you two like something to drink?

394
00:26:32.063 --> 00:26:33.292
I'll have a glass of your rosé.

395
00:26:33.397 --> 00:26:36.765
Oh, make that two. Your best ones.

396
00:26:36.834 --> 00:26:41.237
But first, could you, like, read off
the specials for us?

397
00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:46.609
Yeah. Uh, but I just wanted
to let you know

398
00:26:46.711 --> 00:26:49.737
how sorry we all are
that it didn't work out.

399
00:26:51.082 --> 00:26:52.550
That what didn't work out?

400
00:26:53.818 --> 00:26:56.583
You know, you and Billy.
Oh, such a shame,

401
00:26:56.654 --> 00:26:59.214
with everything going so awesome
for him up there.

402
00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:01.918
Oh, and the 2Chainz thing.

403
00:27:01.993 --> 00:27:03.620
- 2Chainz?
- Oh, that's right.

404
00:27:03.728 --> 00:27:06.789
Like, you're not on the group texts.

405
00:27:06.898 --> 00:27:09.959
My bad.

406
00:27:10.067 --> 00:27:14.129
Sweetie, look here. There is not
a group text that I'm not on, actually.

407
00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:16.430
You sure about that?

408
00:27:18.142 --> 00:27:20.372
Take care of these ladies, please.

409
00:27:20.478 --> 00:27:24.142
- He's been blowing up my phone.
- Constantly.

410
00:27:24.215 --> 00:27:27.879
Oh, so sad since he decided
to work in that shithole little town.

411
00:27:27.985 --> 00:27:32.718
Oh, that's not what I was told,
but then again, what would I know?

412
00:27:33.991 --> 00:27:35.481
Wine's coming up.

413
00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:44.134
Daddy!

414
00:27:44.202 --> 00:27:47.467
This is so exciting. I've never done
anything like this before.

415
00:27:47.538 --> 00:27:49.028
- It's crazy.
- Hey.

416
00:27:50.041 --> 00:27:51.702
Oh, hold up a sec.

417
00:27:51.809 --> 00:27:54.471
- Um, anyway, Sensi, thank you so much.
- Yeah.

418
00:27:54.545 --> 00:27:55.808
I can't wait to see you tonight
at 2Chainz.

419
00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:58.110
- See you later. Bye.
- Bye.

420
00:27:59.317 --> 00:28:00.614
I just registered.

421
00:28:00.685 --> 00:28:02.619
I've got to check into my place
for the next week.

422
00:28:02.687 --> 00:28:04.712
Uh... do you have a place to stay?

423
00:28:04.822 --> 00:28:06.881
Um...

424
00:28:14.031 --> 00:28:15.624
Who's that?

425
00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:17.930
That's world champion Alderic Amedee.

426
00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:20.396
Hey.

427
00:28:23.441 --> 00:28:25.933
- Oh, shit. Yeah.
- I see the French douchebag.

428
00:28:26.043 --> 00:28:29.445
Whoa! Alderic Amedee,
the world champion, is here.

429
00:28:29.547 --> 00:28:31.106
What a waste of time, guys, huh?

430
00:28:31.215 --> 00:28:33.081
Hey Eve, we're gonna
hurry up and get out of here.

431
00:28:33.184 --> 00:28:34.345
Okay?

432
00:28:34.418 --> 00:28:35.749
- Welcome, Alderic.
- Thank you.

433
00:28:35.853 --> 00:28:36.877
Glad you're here to compete.

434
00:28:36.954 --> 00:28:38.513
Uh, no compete. No. No, no, no.

435
00:28:38.589 --> 00:28:40.557
I'm here because Eve,
my sponsor, say I must,

436
00:28:40.625 --> 00:28:43.424
but, uh... I mean, look,
no competition here. Huh?

437
00:28:43.528 --> 00:28:45.223
Ugh. What an asswipe.

438
00:28:45.296 --> 00:28:47.025
Nonetheless, you are welcome.

439
00:28:47.098 --> 00:28:48.691
Speak for yourself, Jake.

440
00:28:48.766 --> 00:28:51.758
I remember you.
You're one of the American boys, huh?

441
00:28:51.869 --> 00:28:54.065
Why don't you go butt-chug
a bottle of wine?

442
00:28:54.171 --> 00:28:55.900
Alderic will crush you.

443
00:28:56.007 --> 00:28:58.203
Hey, Alderic. No competition today.

444
00:28:58.276 --> 00:28:59.266
Eve.

445
00:29:00.578 --> 00:29:03.878
- Jake?
- Oh, Jake.

446
00:29:03.948 --> 00:29:06.508
Last time I saw you
in the South of France, huh?

447
00:29:06.584 --> 00:29:08.211
You ran away like a little bitch.

448
00:29:09.687 --> 00:29:11.052
That's not how I would characterize it.

449
00:29:11.122 --> 00:29:14.422
I think actually yes,
most people would characterize like that.

450
00:29:19.397 --> 00:29:20.296
Hey, Frenchie.

451
00:29:20.398 --> 00:29:22.093
Eh?

452
00:29:22.166 --> 00:29:23.395
Cocksuckers say what?

453
00:29:23.467 --> 00:29:24.957
What?

454
00:29:25.069 --> 00:29:26.969
Yeah. You heard me.

455
00:29:27.071 --> 00:29:29.062
Ah. Funny.

456
00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:31.108
Yeah. I got you. You know what?

457
00:29:31.175 --> 00:29:33.439
If you're lucky, Alderic will have you
for dessert one night.

458
00:29:33.511 --> 00:29:35.070
- Oh, wow.
- Hey.

459
00:29:35.146 --> 00:29:37.080
That is not how we talk
to women in this country.

460
00:29:37.148 --> 00:29:38.513
Oh, yeah? This country?

461
00:29:38.616 --> 00:29:40.584
This country.

462
00:29:43.254 --> 00:29:44.915
Oh, my God.

463
00:29:44.989 --> 00:29:47.424
Boys, break it up!
What are you doing?

464
00:29:47.491 --> 00:29:49.152
Hey! Hey!

465
00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:50.386
No. Break it up. Stop it, stop it.

466
00:29:50.461 --> 00:29:51.929
Go. Hey!

467
00:29:51.996 --> 00:29:53.327
Go on! Stop, it's a long week!

468
00:29:53.431 --> 00:29:55.263
- Just chill.
- Chill? I got no chill.

469
00:29:57.068 --> 00:29:59.230
Go. Go!

470
00:29:59.303 --> 00:30:01.601
Alderic, settle.
Jake, you're right. We go.

471
00:30:01.672 --> 00:30:03.731
- Yeah, sure you go. Huh? Go!
- We go.

472
00:30:03.808 --> 00:30:05.742
- Go, go.
- We go.

473
00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:08.006
- You okay? Good.
- Yeah. I'm good. Sorry.

474
00:30:09.647 --> 00:30:11.274
That's twice you stood up for me.

475
00:30:11.349 --> 00:30:13.181
Can we go?

476
00:30:14.485 --> 00:30:16.146
- Yeah.
- Okay.

477
00:30:19.123 --> 00:30:21.353
Yeah, sure. Here.

478
00:30:22.493 --> 00:30:26.157
Yo, Seth or Billy or whatever
your name is, man.

479
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:29.359
Here are two tickets to 2Chainz tonight.
Both of you come.

480
00:30:29.467 --> 00:30:31.959
You done good, bro.

481
00:30:37.241 --> 00:30:39.175
That was dope.

482
00:30:39.243 --> 00:30:40.404
Get back to work.

483
00:30:43.047 --> 00:30:45.482
- I guess this is it.
- Not bad.

484
00:30:45.549 --> 00:30:48.177
You know Sensi Graves is
like one of the best, like, ever?

485
00:30:48.252 --> 00:30:50.721
She is? She's definitely super cool.

486
00:30:50.821 --> 00:30:53.313
- Yeah, I'm gonna work with her.
- Of course you are.

487
00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:56.121
Seriously, and what kind of work
do you think you'll be doing with her?

488
00:30:56.193 --> 00:30:59.390
Well, you'll see, and I'm pretty sure
you're gonna like it, though.

489
00:30:59.497 --> 00:31:01.556
Not gonna be working for your good friend,
2Chainz, huh?

490
00:31:01.666 --> 00:31:05.796
Watch it, Seth. You know I had
your back with them.

491
00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:08.339
I know. And I'm sorry.

492
00:31:09.874 --> 00:31:12.138
I'm not the girl from the diner, Seth.

493
00:31:12.209 --> 00:31:13.734
I know all of them now.

494
00:31:13.844 --> 00:31:15.972
All of your invited pros.

495
00:31:16.046 --> 00:31:18.310
It's just not as easy for me.

496
00:31:19.550 --> 00:31:21.018
Well, then give me a chance.

497
00:31:36.901 --> 00:31:38.300
Just walk in.

498
00:31:43.607 --> 00:31:46.099
Hello. Excuse me.

499
00:31:48.245 --> 00:31:49.303
Hey, guys?

500
00:31:49.413 --> 00:31:50.903
Huh?

501
00:31:50.981 --> 00:31:52.915
Oh. Hi, there.

502
00:31:54.752 --> 00:31:58.347
Wel-welcome to A-Frames.

503
00:31:58.422 --> 00:32:01.915
Wow. Look at you.

504
00:32:02.026 --> 00:32:03.221
Join?

505
00:32:03.294 --> 00:32:05.058
Uh, not now, but thanks.

506
00:32:05.129 --> 00:32:07.257
- Sure.
- Seriously?

507
00:32:07.365 --> 00:32:09.459
- Yeah.
- Whoa, bro!

508
00:32:11.302 --> 00:32:12.701
<i>¿Cómo se llama?</i>

509
00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:14.397
My name's Sky
and that's my friend, Seth.

510
00:32:14.472 --> 00:32:15.735
Great. Now I'm a friend.

511
00:32:15.806 --> 00:32:17.274
- Can I?
- Yeah.

512
00:32:17.374 --> 00:32:18.398
Thank you.

513
00:32:18.476 --> 00:32:20.638
Please, hook that up.

514
00:32:20.744 --> 00:32:22.610
Oh, you're going!

515
00:32:22.713 --> 00:32:25.205
- There you go!
- Live tall.

516
00:32:25.282 --> 00:32:28.843
- Oh, that is some good stuff!
- Yeah.

517
00:32:28.953 --> 00:32:31.615
Um, he's competing
in that S-tournament thing.

518
00:32:31.689 --> 00:32:35.353
Oh, very cool, dude. We are too...
for like the Open.

519
00:32:35.459 --> 00:32:37.291
Yeah, I'm in the Open too.

520
00:32:37.361 --> 00:32:39.455
They told me this was
my housing for the week?

521
00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:43.125
Yeah, man. But bro,
you're the last one to get here.

522
00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.759
Your room's over there.

523
00:32:44.835 --> 00:32:46.360
It's pretty gnarly, dude.

524
00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:48.802
It's all good. Trust me, I've had worse.

525
00:32:49.807 --> 00:32:50.831
Come on, Sky.

526
00:32:50.941 --> 00:32:54.206
Actually I'm gonna hang here with, um-

527
00:32:54.311 --> 00:32:56.109
Oh, folks call me Rad.

528
00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:58.444
And I'm Cal. Rad <i>y</i> Cal.

529
00:32:58.516 --> 00:33:00.746
Get it, <i>muchacha?</i>

530
00:33:01.819 --> 00:33:04.652
Do you mind taking my bag?
I mean, assuming that that's okay?

531
00:33:04.755 --> 00:33:07.190
Got it.

532
00:33:07.291 --> 00:33:08.486
Pass me the bowl, bro.

533
00:33:08.592 --> 00:33:10.651
- No problem, Rad.
- Bowl hog.

534
00:33:10.761 --> 00:33:12.695
I know, right? Ro, rev.

535
00:33:15.166 --> 00:33:16.327
This is really good.

536
00:33:17.935 --> 00:33:19.528
Wow! I'm very impressed!

537
00:33:40.157 --> 00:33:42.148
Put your hands together
for Rad and Cal.

538
00:33:43.694 --> 00:33:46.425
Come on, let me hear
you all scream.

543
00:34:28.072 --> 00:34:31.940
So we were just arguing
about 2Chainz tonight.

544
00:34:32.042 --> 00:34:33.476
Should be epic.

545
00:34:33.577 --> 00:34:36.046
Some dude named Skeeter gave us tickets.

546
00:34:36.113 --> 00:34:37.444
Some dude?

547
00:34:37.548 --> 00:34:39.915
Babe, Skeets is the bomb.

548
00:34:39.984 --> 00:34:43.284
Your boy Seth must be some badass kiter.

549
00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:47.416

That was nice.

563
00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:55.220
I saw this in your truck. What is it?

564
00:35:55.326 --> 00:35:57.795
Uh, a trident. It's also called the bird.

565
00:35:58.796 --> 00:36:01.493
It's my dad's. Well, was.

566
00:36:01.565 --> 00:36:03.033
Was?

567
00:36:03.133 --> 00:36:06.535
Yeah. He was Special Forces for the Navy,

568
00:36:06.637 --> 00:36:09.129
but he didn't come home.

569
00:36:11.175 --> 00:36:12.540
Your dad was a SEAL.

570
00:36:14.011 --> 00:36:15.945
You must...

571
00:36:16.013 --> 00:36:19.005
you've gotta be so honored, so proud.

572
00:36:21.185 --> 00:36:22.380
I suppose.

573
00:36:25.289 --> 00:36:28.315
So, what time does 2Chainz start?

574
00:36:28.392 --> 00:36:30.884
Midnight, I think.
I was gonna catch a nap.

575
00:36:30.995 --> 00:36:32.827
Oh, so good. Can I join?

576
00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:39.097
- Are you okay?
- Uh, yeah, I'm just... I'm a little tired

577
00:36:39.203 --> 00:36:42.935
and I just need to rest a minute
if that's okay?

578
00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:44.098
Of course.

579
00:37:00.858 --> 00:37:02.087
Thank you, Seth.

580
00:37:03.227 --> 00:37:05.025
Thanks for being so nice to me.

581
00:37:07.231 --> 00:37:09.165
Thank you for...

582
00:37:09.233 --> 00:37:11.224
Oh, I'm so tired.

583
00:37:22.446 --> 00:37:25.381
I think you're the most amazing girl
I've ever met.

584
00:38:19.002 --> 00:38:22.131
Can I help you? Oh, my God.

585
00:38:22.239 --> 00:38:23.729
Babe alert.

586
00:38:23.807 --> 00:38:28.108
Hey, Cal. No lie.
You gotta come check this out.

587
00:38:28.178 --> 00:38:30.272
Another one landed at our front door.

588
00:38:30.347 --> 00:38:32.145
Dude, I'm right here.

589
00:38:32.249 --> 00:38:34.274
Righteous! She is gorgeous.

590
00:38:34.351 --> 00:38:37.616
Hi. I was told Billy Johnson
is staying here.

591
00:38:37.688 --> 00:38:40.055
- She's beautiful.
- A vision.

592
00:38:40.157 --> 00:38:41.886
Think I have a shot?

593
00:38:41.992 --> 00:38:43.653
No chance.

594
00:38:43.727 --> 00:38:46.856
Oh, wait, wait.
We gotta do that again.

595
00:38:48.165 --> 00:38:51.135
Nailed it.

596
00:38:51.201 --> 00:38:54.034
Billy Johnson. Hmm?

597
00:38:54.138 --> 00:38:56.072
Her name's Billie Johnson.

598
00:38:56.173 --> 00:38:58.369
Hot chicks always have cool names.

599
00:38:58.475 --> 00:38:59.704
No. No.

600
00:39:01.044 --> 00:39:03.069
Oh, sorry. Okay.

601
00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:06.343
I am <i>looking</i> for Billy Johnson.

602
00:39:06.417 --> 00:39:07.885
Is he here?

603
00:39:07.985 --> 00:39:09.384
You're not Billie Johnson?

604
00:39:09.486 --> 00:39:13.013
- Now I'm confused.
- Huh. Now?

605
00:39:15.192 --> 00:39:19.356
Look, the people at REAL Watersports
told me that Billy was staying here.

606
00:39:19.463 --> 00:39:21.955
Oh, yeah, the Opie guy!
The dude who's cool with Skeets.

607
00:39:22.032 --> 00:39:23.158
Yeah, he's here!

608
00:39:23.233 --> 00:39:24.826
Ugh. Gross.

609
00:39:24.902 --> 00:39:26.461
They're in there.

610
00:39:28.205 --> 00:39:29.331
They?

611
00:39:39.383 --> 00:39:40.544
Oh, shit.

612
00:39:40.651 --> 00:39:43.052
- What the hell, Billy? What is this?
- Sarah, what are you...?

613
00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:44.110
It's not what it looks like.

614
00:39:44.221 --> 00:39:46.883
I leave you for all of two days
and you go and do this?

615
00:39:46.957 --> 00:39:48.083
Chill. I can explain.

616
00:39:48.192 --> 00:39:51.594
Do not tell me to chill. Okay?

617
00:39:51.695 --> 00:39:53.390
What do you mean, you can explain?

618
00:39:53.463 --> 00:39:55.431
- Who are you?
- Who the hell are you?

619
00:39:55.532 --> 00:39:57.193
Um, I'm his girlfriend.

620
00:39:57.267 --> 00:39:59.361
And this is my boyfriend
you're sleeping with.

621
00:39:59.436 --> 00:40:00.733
- He wishes.
- Huh.

622
00:40:00.804 --> 00:40:02.636
Oh, wait. I know who you are.

623
00:40:02.739 --> 00:40:06.698
You're the girl who, um, kept on
blowing up his phone the entire trip here.

624
00:40:06.777 --> 00:40:09.041
So you two took like a road trip
or something?

625
00:40:09.113 --> 00:40:10.638
- Is that right?
- I just met her.

626
00:40:10.747 --> 00:40:13.273
Really? That's how you're playing this?

627
00:40:13.383 --> 00:40:14.544
You're sleeping with a girl you just met?

628
00:40:14.618 --> 00:40:16.245
No, we didn't sleep together.

629
00:40:16.353 --> 00:40:18.549
Okay, Seth, I don't talk
about my business.

630
00:40:18.622 --> 00:40:20.750
I don't answer to her and certainly
don't answer to you.

631
00:40:20.858 --> 00:40:25.125
Seth? Oh, no, no, no, little girl,
that's not his name.

632
00:40:25.229 --> 00:40:27.061
What other lies did you
tell her to bang her, Billy?

633
00:40:27.130 --> 00:40:30.395
Hmm? I mean, clearly not too many.

634
00:40:30.467 --> 00:40:31.457
Sarah.

635
00:40:32.469 --> 00:40:33.959
Whatever. I'm out.

636
00:40:34.071 --> 00:40:36.130
You guys deserve each other.

637
00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:38.231
He's all yours.

638
00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:45.139
Whatever happened to amazing?

639
00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:48.646
Sky! Sky!

640
00:40:49.853 --> 00:40:51.617
Whoa!

641
00:40:51.688 --> 00:40:54.020
Sarah, what are you doing here?

642
00:40:54.124 --> 00:40:55.614
I texted you.

643
00:40:55.692 --> 00:41:00.129
Here I fly into this godforsaken,
sand-filled wasteland

644
00:41:00.197 --> 00:41:02.632
to come and forgive you
and give you a second chance,

645
00:41:02.699 --> 00:41:04.667
and this how you repay me?

646
00:41:04.768 --> 00:41:05.826
What are you talking about?

647
00:41:05.936 --> 00:41:08.803
I mean, Hatteras,
this place is awesome. I love it.

648
00:41:08.872 --> 00:41:11.500
Then stay here, then,
'cause I am getting the hell out of here.

649
00:41:11.608 --> 00:41:15.044
Forget you, Billy Johnson, or Seth,

650
00:41:15.145 --> 00:41:17.079
or whoever the hell
you're pretending to be.

651
00:41:19.483 --> 00:41:22.077
Take your good last look. Hm.

652
00:41:26.657 --> 00:41:29.422
Whoa!

653
00:41:31.128 --> 00:41:32.960
- Really?
- Dude.

654
00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:35.499
- I don't think that went to well.
- Uh-uh.

655
00:41:52.349 --> 00:41:54.215
Hey, English. You need to practice.

656
00:41:54.317 --> 00:41:57.218
Ah. These Americans. No discipline.

657
00:41:58.522 --> 00:42:00.854
Well, I'm excited to see 2Chainz.

658
00:42:00.924 --> 00:42:02.858
Such good friends. I don't get it.

659
00:42:02.926 --> 00:42:05.418
I don't know how they can compete
during the day

660
00:42:05.529 --> 00:42:08.055
and then dance, party all night.

661
00:42:09.066 --> 00:42:11.398
I think they just grew up together,
you know,

662
00:42:11.501 --> 00:42:12.832
and they're in the sports together.

663
00:42:13.837 --> 00:42:14.895
I envy that.

664
00:42:17.174 --> 00:42:19.666
Friends aren't a bad thing.

665
00:42:19.743 --> 00:42:21.370
No, no, they're not a bad thing,

666
00:42:21.478 --> 00:42:23.344
but they don't want
to be Alderic's friend.

667
00:42:25.215 --> 00:42:28.241
Alderic, maybe not, but if you would be
more like yourself...

668
00:42:30.554 --> 00:42:31.715
Not when I compete.

669
00:42:55.712 --> 00:42:58.477
Sky, if I get to proclaim it,
you look phenomenal, like a goddess.

670
00:42:58.582 --> 00:43:01.882
Thank you. I borrowed this,
but now I'm modeling Sensi's designs.

671
00:43:01.952 --> 00:43:03.215
- No way!
- Yeah.

672
00:43:03.286 --> 00:43:04.981
Sensi! Yeah!

673
00:43:05.088 --> 00:43:07.455
Hey. Come on. It's worth a shot.

674
00:43:10.227 --> 00:43:13.561
- Hey, can you let me in?
- Not gonna happen, buddy.

675
00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:15.394
Yo, Seth, what's up, man?

676
00:43:15.465 --> 00:43:17.399
Hey, you can let him in. He's cool.

677
00:43:17.467 --> 00:43:18.662
Okay, you're in.

678
00:43:19.669 --> 00:43:21.228
Oh, uh, they're with me.

679
00:43:21.305 --> 00:43:24.138
Sorry, pal. Only you. Back in line.

680
00:43:24.241 --> 00:43:25.936
- Thanks for trying, Billy.
- Thanks, Billy.

681
00:43:26.042 --> 00:43:29.444
- Hey, see you soon.
- All right, man.

682
00:43:44.061 --> 00:43:45.620
I better take this.

683
00:43:51.701 --> 00:43:54.693
Arriving fashionably late
from Cannes, France.

684
00:43:54.805 --> 00:43:56.773
I'm watching you, Frenchie.

685
00:44:00.177 --> 00:44:01.941
Hey. Watch your mouth.

686
00:44:02.012 --> 00:44:03.878
Oh, the Open boy is here. Wow.

687
00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:05.948
Dick-less, skinny jean-wearing,

688
00:44:06.016 --> 00:44:08.383
man-purse-toting piece of Euro-trash.

689
00:44:08.485 --> 00:44:10.010
<i>Oui, oui,</i> Jackoozie.

690
00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:11.815
- Shut the fuck up.
- Well, you shut the fuck up.

691
00:44:11.888 --> 00:44:13.049
- I'll beat your ass.
- Bring it on.

692
00:44:13.156 --> 00:44:15.215
Hey, hey. Not now.

693
00:44:15.325 --> 00:44:18.351
God! It's ridiculous.

694
00:44:18.461 --> 00:44:20.452
Championship hasn't even started.

695
00:44:21.865 --> 00:44:23.424
You really want to go after it?

696
00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:25.491
Well, does a Frenchman's fart
smell like fromage?

697
00:44:25.602 --> 00:44:27.536
{\an8}Huh?

698
00:44:27.637 --> 00:44:29.332
- That's cheese, bro.
- Skeeter!

699
00:44:30.841 --> 00:44:32.104
I know how we'll settle it.

700
00:44:32.175 --> 00:44:34.143
Tomorrow. A downwind.

701
00:44:34.211 --> 00:44:35.645
No, no. I don't downwind with him.

702
00:44:35.712 --> 00:44:37.202
Fight, yes. Downwind, no.

703
00:44:37.314 --> 00:44:39.783
Yep, a free shred downwinder.

704
00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:42.945
No rules, anything goes.
That's much better than a fight.

705
00:44:43.019 --> 00:44:44.453
Yeah.

706
00:44:44.521 --> 00:44:45.989
After the Open, tomorrow.

707
00:44:46.056 --> 00:44:47.717
We meet at Planet of the Apes.

708
00:44:47.824 --> 00:44:49.849
I am so in.

709
00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:51.894
Oh, little cowboy can kite, huh?

710
00:44:51.995 --> 00:44:53.463
You're going to bring your trainer kite?

711
00:44:53.530 --> 00:44:55.020
Get him out of here.

712
00:44:55.098 --> 00:44:56.566
Let's go to the concert.

713
00:44:56.666 --> 00:45:00.000
Oh, no, no, no. I go to the concert
when I want to go to the concert. Okay?

714
00:45:00.070 --> 00:45:01.231
Oh, my God.

715
00:45:01.338 --> 00:45:02.828
Let's go to the concert.

716
00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:12.906
Copy. Uncle Jake. They're ready.

717
00:45:13.016 --> 00:45:16.577
Time for 2Chainz!

718
00:45:16.686 --> 00:45:19.917
Y'all make some noise!

719
00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:25.058
Now right now I want to introduce
to the stage

720
00:45:25.162 --> 00:45:26.687
the man making this all possible.

721
00:45:26.763 --> 00:45:30.495
Y'all make noise for Jake Wind,
from Wind Voyager!

722
00:45:36.439 --> 00:45:38.430
I hope you're all looking pretty tonight.

723
00:45:38.541 --> 00:45:40.509
I hope you're smiling
'cause we got cameras filming

724
00:45:40.577 --> 00:45:42.011
each and every one of you.

725
00:45:44.081 --> 00:45:48.018
Because the tournament is tomorrow,
what do we do tonight?

726
00:45:48.084 --> 00:45:50.746
- Party!
- That's right.

727
00:45:50.854 --> 00:45:54.222
It is my pleasure to introduce to you
from Hotlanta, Georgia,

728
00:45:54.291 --> 00:45:57.386
Grammy-winning and American rap sensation,

729
00:45:57.460 --> 00:45:59.588
give it up for 2Chainz!

730
00:46:16.847 --> 00:46:18.474
You ready?

731
00:46:18.581 --> 00:46:20.242
One, two!

732
00:46:20.317 --> 00:46:22.012
<i>Uno, dos, tres,</i> come on!

733
00:47:54.878 --> 00:47:57.313
Show time!

734
00:48:01.017 --> 00:48:04.681
<i>From Real Water Sports,

735

00:48:06.756 --> 00:48:10.784
<i>for the Wind Voyager
Triple-S World Championship.</i>

737
00:48:10.894 --> 00:48:14.296
<i>Today is unique because it's not
the pros who we watch compete,</i>

738
00:48:14.397 --> 00:48:16.798
<i>rather amateurs from all over the world</i>

739
00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:20.859
<i>who have gathered to show their skills
in hopes of being the one.</i>

740
00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:26.072
<i>It's ugly. It'll be painful,
but each year,</i>

741
00:48:27.310 --> 00:48:31.269
<i>the one amateur who wins today's Open
turns pro overnight</i>

742
00:48:31.381 --> 00:48:33.713
<i>and earns the right to compete
the rest of the week</i>

743
00:48:33.783 --> 00:48:36.047

<i>Our next competitor is Ryan Bowen,</i>

746
00:48:41.958 --> 00:48:45.394
<i>representing beer Search and Rescue?</i>

<i>Is that a hockey helmet?</i>

748
00:48:47.364 --> 00:48:49.958
- This guy any good?
- No, dude. He sucks.

749
00:48:50.066 --> 00:48:52.228
Yeah, he's totally whack, bro.

750
00:49:08.585 --> 00:49:10.815
Oh! Oh!

751
00:49:13.690 --> 00:49:14.987
Oh!

752
00:49:15.091 --> 00:49:18.152
- Total yard sale.
- Tomahawk.

753

00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:25.498
- You're up next, Billy.
- Crush it, man.

756
00:49:25.602 --> 00:49:28.003
Hey, dude. Can we get a ride
to the downwinder after the Open?

757
00:49:28.104 --> 00:49:29.265
Yeah, dude. For sure.

758
00:49:29.339 --> 00:49:31.205
- Oh, dope.
- All right. Thanks.

759
00:49:31.307 --> 00:49:33.503
Sweet. Later, dude. Kill it!

760
00:49:40.750 --> 00:49:42.775
I'm Billy Johnson Jr.
and I'm gonna do a 720.

761
00:49:43.987 --> 00:49:45.785
Johnson says he's doing a 720.

762
00:49:45.855 --> 00:49:48.085
Yeah, right.

763
00:50:14.517 --> 00:50:17.543
- Oh! Badass!
- Stuck it!

764
00:50:17.654 --> 00:50:18.644
Copped it.

765
00:50:53.189 --> 00:50:55.157
Ooh, yeah!

766
00:51:01.664 --> 00:51:04.690
Dude, this is gonna be big.

767
00:51:13.076 --> 00:51:14.908
Billy, this is for you.

768
00:51:14.978 --> 00:51:17.572
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

769
00:51:17.647 --> 00:51:20.548
We'll go rig your gear. Come on, Cal.

770
00:51:20.617 --> 00:51:22.483
Rad and Cal are here!

771
00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:26.218
- Hey, Skeeter.
- Dude, you made it!

772
00:51:26.289 --> 00:51:27.814
I heard you crushed it at the Open.

773
00:51:27.924 --> 00:51:30.894
I think I did okay, but we'll see.

774
00:51:42.205 --> 00:51:43.263
Heard you did good.

775
00:51:44.741 --> 00:51:45.970
Look, can we talk?

776
00:51:46.075 --> 00:51:48.476
Sky, babe, he crushed it.

777
00:51:49.612 --> 00:51:50.773
I'm happy for you.

778
00:51:53.616 --> 00:51:55.106
Here, bro.

779
00:51:55.218 --> 00:51:56.743
Thanks.

780
00:51:56.820 --> 00:51:58.219
Sorry, excuse me.

781
00:51:58.288 --> 00:51:59.619
- Hi!
- Hey.

782
00:52:01.124 --> 00:52:03.115
You're such an ass.

783
00:52:05.061 --> 00:52:07.291
Alderic Amedee,
the world champion is here.

784
00:52:07.397 --> 00:52:09.491
Alder-dick. I didn't think you'd show.

785
00:52:09.599 --> 00:52:11.533
You know, couldn't resist.

786
00:52:14.137 --> 00:52:16.504
- All right. Let's get this thing going.
- I love it!

787
00:52:16.606 --> 00:52:17.971
We start on the beach.

788
00:52:18.041 --> 00:52:19.941
We go eight miles down
to REAL Watersports.

789
00:52:20.009 --> 00:52:22.706
First one across the buoys
of REAL Watersports wins.

790
00:52:25.648 --> 00:52:26.774
And the rules are?

791
00:52:26.849 --> 00:52:28.544
There are no rules!

792
00:52:28.651 --> 00:52:29.948
That's right. Anything goes.

793
00:52:30.019 --> 00:52:32.147
- All right. Kites up.
- Let's do this!

794
00:52:32.221 --> 00:52:34.121
Look, Sky, we really need to talk.

795
00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:36.158
Oh, hey, Jake. Can I get a ride?

796
00:52:36.225 --> 00:52:38.455
- Yeah, sure. Come on.
- Really?

797
00:52:38.528 --> 00:52:39.552
Sorry.

798
00:52:46.169 --> 00:52:48.661
Uncle Jake!

799
00:52:48.772 --> 00:52:50.262
Get the life preservers.

800
00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:52.330
You know it's obvious.

801
00:52:52.442 --> 00:52:53.307
What?

802
00:52:54.377 --> 00:52:55.310
Billy.

803
00:52:55.378 --> 00:52:57.142
I'm not following.

804
00:52:57.213 --> 00:53:00.148
Young lady,
that boy is crazy for you.

805
00:53:12.562 --> 00:53:13.893
Ready!

806
00:53:16.499 --> 00:53:17.398
Set!

807
00:53:19.602 --> 00:53:21.434
Go!

808
00:53:28.411 --> 00:53:29.879
I Amedee!

809
00:53:34.017 --> 00:53:35.246
Hey!

810
00:54:30.273 --> 00:54:31.399
Whoa!

811
00:54:49.926 --> 00:54:51.257
Hey!

812
00:54:51.327 --> 00:54:53.819
Fuck off, Frenchie!

813
00:55:22.959 --> 00:55:24.154
Woo-hoo!

814
00:55:25.695 --> 00:55:27.163
On your back, dick!

815
00:55:33.336 --> 00:55:34.895
I'm coming for you!

816
00:57:16.739 --> 00:57:17.570
Oh, no!

817
00:57:55.978 --> 00:57:56.911
<i>Merde!</i>

818
00:58:05.321 --> 00:58:07.415
- Aubrey, go get the jersey.
- Yeah? Okay.

819
00:58:10.459 --> 00:58:12.188
Hey. Finally. Can we talk?

820
00:58:12.295 --> 00:58:15.993
Billy Johnson Jr., that was epic!
You had a good day.

821
00:58:16.098 --> 00:58:17.623
Kind of wish I could have seen
the look on Alderic's face

822
00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:19.634
- when I landed in front of him.
- That's all right.

823
00:58:19.702 --> 00:58:22.137
You'll see that kicker, Alderic,
and the rest of the pros all this week.

824
00:58:22.204 --> 00:58:24.639
- What do you mean?
- Congratulations, young man.

825
00:58:24.707 --> 00:58:26.004
You won the Open.

826
00:58:28.911 --> 00:58:30.970
Day after tomorrow,
you're a professional rider

827
00:58:31.047 --> 00:58:32.537
in the Wind Voyager Triple-S.

828
00:58:32.648 --> 00:58:33.809
Congrats, dude.

829
00:58:35.217 --> 00:58:36.514
Are you serious?

830
00:58:39.255 --> 00:58:41.587
Wow, uh, thank you, Mr. Wind.

831
00:58:41.691 --> 00:58:44.319
- No, no, no, no. Jake.
- Jake.

832
00:58:44.393 --> 00:58:47.260
Hey, is it all right
if I head back out there?

833
00:58:47.363 --> 00:58:48.524
I'm working on something new.

834
00:58:49.532 --> 00:58:50.863
Send it, kid.

835
00:59:06.749 --> 00:59:08.183
Hey there, rookie.

836
00:59:08.251 --> 00:59:10.879
Oh, uh, I'm so sorry.

837
00:59:10.987 --> 00:59:12.216
- Miss, um...
- Catherine.

838
00:59:18.895 --> 00:59:20.522
You should be proud of your boy.

839
00:59:26.802 --> 00:59:28.361
I saw your Open run.

840
00:59:28.437 --> 00:59:32.431
You're good. Real good. So am I.

841
00:59:34.076 --> 00:59:36.306
I'm throwing a party tomorrow night
for all the riders.

842
00:59:36.412 --> 00:59:38.904
It's kind of a tradition
the night before the Triple-S.

843
00:59:38.981 --> 00:59:40.813
So, I guess now you're invited.

844
00:59:40.917 --> 00:59:41.816
Uh-huh.

845
00:59:45.087 --> 00:59:46.316
You should come.

846
00:59:48.090 --> 00:59:49.922
- Okay.
- Okay.

847
00:59:53.596 --> 00:59:56.395
- Old people are so weird.
- Hmm.

848
01:01:22.852 --> 01:01:25.446
Mm-hmm.

849
01:01:25.521 --> 01:01:26.989
Excuse me, I gotta take this.

850
01:01:28.224 --> 01:01:29.555
Hey, Billy boy, how's it going?

851
01:01:29.658 --> 01:01:32.093
Uh, good. I guess.

852
01:01:32.194 --> 01:01:36.392
You guess? Billy, you won the Open.
It's gotta be better than good.

853
01:01:36.498 --> 01:01:37.932
How'd you know?

854
01:01:38.033 --> 01:01:40.593
We watched it on OBXS.

855
01:01:40.703 --> 01:01:42.501
You're kind of a celebrity
around here, Billy.

856
01:01:42.571 --> 01:01:43.936
The place went nuts when they heard.

857
01:01:44.039 --> 01:01:47.168
Really? Huh.

858
01:01:47.243 --> 01:01:49.439
So what's really on your mind?

859
01:01:51.547 --> 01:01:52.605
How do you know...

860
01:01:53.716 --> 01:01:56.208
if you should fight for someone?

861
01:01:57.253 --> 01:01:58.948
Ah, a girl.

862
01:01:59.055 --> 01:02:01.387
Yes, sir.

863
01:02:01.457 --> 01:02:04.518
Well, I call it the tingle test.

864
01:02:06.262 --> 01:02:07.525
Tingle, sir?

865
01:02:07.596 --> 01:02:10.861
It's usually with a girl
you never expected.

866
01:02:10.933 --> 01:02:12.901
She's the one where your arm,

867
01:02:13.002 --> 01:02:15.198
or your elbow, or your knee

868
01:02:15.271 --> 01:02:16.898
<i>accidentally bump into one another,</i>

869
01:02:17.006 --> 01:02:18.599
<i>and when that happens,</i>

870
01:02:18.708 --> 01:02:22.770
your body feels a...
a tingle, a shock wave.

871
01:02:22.878 --> 01:02:26.007
<i>And if she feels that tingle too...</i>

872
01:02:26.081 --> 01:02:27.674
<i>then that's the girl you fight for.</i>

873
01:02:29.185 --> 01:02:30.619
How do you know if she feels it too?

874
01:02:30.719 --> 01:02:34.917
I suppose you know by the way she either
looks at you like everybody else,

875
01:02:34.990 --> 01:02:37.459
<i>or looks in you. If she looks in,</i>

876
01:02:37.559 --> 01:02:39.994
she's looking at your soul.

877
01:02:40.996 --> 01:02:43.055
<i>That's how soulmates are made.</i>

878
01:02:43.132 --> 01:02:45.123
Your mom and dad sure had that.

879
01:02:45.234 --> 01:02:46.633
Tingle test.

880
01:02:48.337 --> 01:02:51.102
Yeah, I, uh...

881
01:02:51.173 --> 01:02:53.608
I like that, sir.

882
01:03:02.618 --> 01:03:04.416
- Hey, how are you?
- Hey, bro.

883
01:03:04.486 --> 01:03:05.612
Good to see you.

884
01:03:07.156 --> 01:03:09.090
- William, baby.
- Hi, how are you?

885
01:03:09.158 --> 01:03:12.059
I thought maybe you decided
not to join our little soiree.

886
01:03:12.127 --> 01:03:13.959
Well, thank you for inviting me,
Miss Catherine.

887
01:03:14.063 --> 01:03:16.657
You're wel... aw, you are too cute.

888
01:03:16.765 --> 01:03:19.757
Would you like to go on a private tour
before we all go inside?

889
01:03:19.835 --> 01:03:21.496
Uh, you know...

890
01:03:21.604 --> 01:03:24.266
- Oh, sweet.
- Thanks, bro. Good looking out.

891
01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:26.240
I actually have to go
catch up with some friends,

892
01:03:26.308 --> 01:03:28.072
- so excuse me.
- Okay.

893
01:03:29.812 --> 01:03:32.144
Hide this. Don't serve it.

894
01:03:32.247 --> 01:03:35.547
Guys, how did you get invited?

895
01:03:35.651 --> 01:03:37.813
- What?
- We weren't invited?

896
01:03:37.887 --> 01:03:41.050
- Well, we're here...
- Now.

897
01:03:51.167 --> 01:03:54.137
- This remind you of anything?
- No.

898
01:03:54.203 --> 01:03:56.001
Come on. Really?

899
01:03:56.071 --> 01:03:57.835
No, Jake.

900
01:03:57.906 --> 01:04:01.171
Look, we can't pretend
that we didn't happen.

901
01:04:01.243 --> 01:04:03.234
We tried. It didn't work.

902
01:04:03.345 --> 01:04:04.813
I know. That was my fault.

903
01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:08.282
I admit that. But I wanted us forever.

904
01:04:08.350 --> 01:04:10.614
I haven't seen you in forever.

905
01:04:10.686 --> 01:04:13.849
It's only been six months
and thought about you every second.

906
01:04:13.956 --> 01:04:16.550
Then why didn't you call?
Or come back to me or talk to me.

907
01:04:16.658 --> 01:04:17.682
Anything. A hint?

908
01:04:20.796 --> 01:04:23.561
I don't know. I was confused.

909
01:04:24.566 --> 01:04:27.228
You were so excited
about working with Alderic.

910
01:04:27.336 --> 01:04:28.826
I didn't want to crush
that accomplishment.

911
01:04:28.904 --> 01:04:29.962
I couldn't. I wouldn't.

912
01:04:31.407 --> 01:04:33.034
Plus, I didn't know.

913
01:04:34.643 --> 01:04:36.634
Didn't know what?

914
01:04:40.282 --> 01:04:42.774
I didn't know if you were falling for him.

915
01:04:42.885 --> 01:04:45.377
I mean, come on.
He's... he's the best in the world.

916
01:04:45.454 --> 01:04:47.354
He's younger.

917
01:04:47.423 --> 01:04:49.414
He's French.

918
01:04:49.525 --> 01:04:53.120
And he's a real douchebag.
I mean, come on, Jake, give me credit.

919
01:04:54.129 --> 01:04:55.858
That he is.

920
01:04:55.931 --> 01:04:57.763
And you're right. I-I should have.

921
01:05:01.103 --> 01:05:03.595
I've had this since Cannes.

922
01:05:05.541 --> 01:05:06.531
Recognize it?

923
01:05:08.043 --> 01:05:09.238
- I do.
- You should.

924
01:05:09.345 --> 01:05:10.369
You threw it at me pretty hard.

925
01:05:10.445 --> 01:05:12.106
You deserved it.

926
01:05:12.214 --> 01:05:14.683
I'm sorry. I was an idiot.

927
01:05:14.750 --> 01:05:16.184
And all I'm asking...

928
01:05:17.353 --> 01:05:19.515
is for another chance
to do right by you.

929
01:05:20.556 --> 01:05:23.048
Eve, I haven't given up on us.

930
01:05:24.059 --> 01:05:25.754
I love you.

931
01:05:28.697 --> 01:05:29.755
You're my soulmate.

932
01:05:46.615 --> 01:05:48.640
- Hey.
- Uncle Jake!

933
01:05:48.751 --> 01:05:50.515
Come on! Everyone's waiting!

934
01:05:50.619 --> 01:05:51.814
Okay.

935
01:05:53.188 --> 01:05:55.623
We better get going.

936
01:05:59.394 --> 01:06:01.089
Aw, thank you so much.

937
01:06:04.032 --> 01:06:07.093
Jake, my man. What's her story?

938
01:06:07.169 --> 01:06:09.137
Super rich and hot as balls.

939
01:06:09.204 --> 01:06:11.730
And likes to deflower you young ones.

940
01:06:11.807 --> 01:06:14.299
Oh, boy.

941
01:06:14.410 --> 01:06:16.310
Aubrey, can I get you a Shirley Temple?

942
01:06:16.411 --> 01:06:18.778
What's a Shirley Temple?

943
01:06:18.847 --> 01:06:21.578
Eve. Finally, you arrive.

944
01:06:21.650 --> 01:06:23.948
We should leave soon. Okay?

945
01:06:24.019 --> 01:06:25.851
We'll leave when it's time to leave.

946
01:06:28.290 --> 01:06:30.520
You have a beautiful home, Miss C.

947
01:06:30.626 --> 01:06:33.118
Oh, darling, I rent this old thing.

948
01:06:33.195 --> 01:06:35.289
My home's actually in Aspen.

949
01:06:38.601 --> 01:06:41.468
Hmm. Excuse me.

950
01:06:41.537 --> 01:06:45.064
There you are. Last but not least.

951
01:06:45.174 --> 01:06:46.801
- Sky, is it?
- Call me Skyler.

952
01:06:46.875 --> 01:06:48.206
Skyler, that's right.

953
01:06:48.310 --> 01:06:51.678
Well, come on in.
Don't you look nice?

954
01:06:51.747 --> 01:06:52.839
Thank you.

955
01:06:52.915 --> 01:06:54.474
Did you borrow your dress?

956
01:06:55.651 --> 01:06:57.551
No, I model these for Sensi now.

957
01:06:57.653 --> 01:06:59.178
Oh...

958
01:06:59.254 --> 01:07:00.744
But this dress is, I don't know,

959
01:07:00.856 --> 01:07:02.915
much too young for you.

960
01:07:03.025 --> 01:07:05.357
They don't make a size small enough
for me, honey.

961
01:07:05.427 --> 01:07:07.054
Enjoy.

962
01:07:07.162 --> 01:07:08.527
Yeah.

963
01:07:16.238 --> 01:07:18.730
I'd like to make a toast.

964
01:07:18.841 --> 01:07:21.037
First, for hosting
and always supporting us,

965
01:07:21.143 --> 01:07:22.577
the lovely Catherine.

966
01:07:22.678 --> 01:07:25.170
I also want you to look
around your tables.

967
01:07:25.247 --> 01:07:28.979
You are staring at some
of the best kiteboarders in the world.

968
01:07:29.051 --> 01:07:31.850
All of you want to win,
and in the end,

969
01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:33.888
there will be three men
and three women on that podium

970
01:07:33.989 --> 01:07:36.481
and one Iconic Air award,
and then what are we gonna do?

971
01:07:36.558 --> 01:07:38.424
Send it!

972
01:07:38.527 --> 01:07:40.052
Wherever the wind blows us,
all over the world.

973
01:07:40.162 --> 01:07:42.563
Raise your glasses
to Catherine, to competition,

974
01:07:42.665 --> 01:07:44.394
and most importantly, to one another.

975
01:07:46.435 --> 01:07:47.630
Can I say something?

976
01:07:47.736 --> 01:07:49.101
Oh!

977
01:07:49.204 --> 01:07:50.763
- Oh.
- Nice.

978
01:07:52.975 --> 01:07:55.569
Here's to space.

979
01:07:55.644 --> 01:07:58.875
When God made man,
he made 'im with string.

980
01:07:58.947 --> 01:08:01.109
He had a little extra,
so he left a little thing.

981
01:08:02.651 --> 01:08:05.621
When God made woman,
he made her with lace

982
01:08:05.721 --> 01:08:08.656
and he didn't have enough
so he left a little space.

983
01:08:08.757 --> 01:08:10.623
Here's to space.

984
01:08:11.727 --> 01:08:13.422
- To space.
- Hey! There you go!

985
01:08:15.097 --> 01:08:16.428
Aubrey, shut your ears.

986
01:08:16.532 --> 01:08:17.465
I'm used to it.

987
01:08:19.234 --> 01:08:22.397
- To space.
- To space!

988
01:08:25.774 --> 01:08:27.139
- Bye, thank you.
- Thank you.

989
01:08:27.242 --> 01:08:29.233
- As always.
- Thank you for coming.

990
01:08:29.311 --> 01:08:30.972
- Bye, Aubrey.
- <i>Merci.</i>

991
01:08:31.079 --> 01:08:32.604
- Good night.
- Good night.

992
01:08:34.283 --> 01:08:36.377
- Are you sure you have to go?
- Yes.

993
01:08:36.452 --> 01:08:39.319
Thank you so much, ma'am.
I gotta get rest for tomorrow.

994
01:08:39.421 --> 01:08:41.890
You are welcome, but I sure
could eat you up with a spoon.

995
01:08:41.957 --> 01:08:43.652
Go get some rest.

996
01:08:43.759 --> 01:08:45.784
- All right. Good night.
- Good night.

997
01:08:47.362 --> 01:08:50.855
Hey, I have some advice for you.

998
01:08:50.966 --> 01:08:54.266
Years ago, I did not fight for love
when I had the chance.

999
01:08:54.336 --> 01:08:56.327
Don't make the same mistake I did.

1000
01:08:58.340 --> 01:08:59.671
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1001
01:08:59.775 --> 01:09:01.766
- Good night.
- Good night.

1002
01:09:01.844 --> 01:09:03.471
- Miss Catherine, thank you.
- Yes?

1003
01:09:03.545 --> 01:09:04.842
- <i>Konnichiwa.</i>
- You're welcome.

1004
01:09:04.946 --> 01:09:06.175
- Have a good one.
- See you tomorrow.

1005
01:09:06.281 --> 01:09:07.476
- For sure.
- Hey, good night.

1006
01:09:07.549 --> 01:09:09.210
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you.

1007
01:09:09.318 --> 01:09:12.344
Hey, um, is it okay
if I get my backpack?

1008
01:09:12.454 --> 01:09:14.786
I left it the other day
and I kind of need my stuff.

1009
01:09:14.857 --> 01:09:17.292
Uh, yeah.

1010
01:09:17.359 --> 01:09:19.953
Yeah, of course. Come on.

1011
01:09:20.028 --> 01:09:21.359
- Good night.
- Cat-woman.

1012
01:09:21.463 --> 01:09:22.692
- Aw.
- That dinner was epic.

1013
01:09:22.798 --> 01:09:23.856
Oh, I'm glad you liked it.

1014
01:09:23.965 --> 01:09:25.330
Good night. Bye.

1015
01:09:28.537 --> 01:09:29.800
You're not going anywhere.

1016
01:09:31.006 --> 01:09:32.974
How about a little space?

1017
01:09:48.724 --> 01:09:50.988
She's not up there, is she?

1018
01:09:51.059 --> 01:09:54.085
Sarah? No.

1019
01:09:54.196 --> 01:09:55.925
She's gone and she's not coming back.

1020
01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:00.025
Okay, then.

1021
01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:06.408
Wait.

1022
01:10:08.343 --> 01:10:12.439
Look... I didn't tell you why she left.

1023
01:10:12.548 --> 01:10:14.573
Yeah, she thought you cheated with me.

1024
01:10:14.683 --> 01:10:18.415
No, I... I told her the truth.

1025
01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:20.010
She knows nothing happened between us.

1026
01:10:21.156 --> 01:10:24.057
Nothing happened? Really?

1027
01:10:25.394 --> 01:10:28.329
Look. You don't owe me anything.
I don't owe you anything.

1028
01:10:28.397 --> 01:10:30.422
I mean... you're a great guy.

1029
01:10:31.433 --> 01:10:32.423
Sky, hold on.

1030
01:10:33.568 --> 01:10:35.036
Don't do this. I'm not doing this.

1031
01:10:35.103 --> 01:10:37.572
I don't know "this."
I was never taught "this."

1032
01:10:37.673 --> 01:10:39.698
Sky, just listen to me! Hear me out.

1033
01:10:40.876 --> 01:10:42.275
My dad was killed.

1034
01:10:43.445 --> 01:10:45.937
And I feel really guilty,

1035
01:10:46.048 --> 01:10:49.348
because my only memories of him
are what people tell me.

1036
01:10:49.418 --> 01:10:51.113
And then my mom, she got sick,

1037
01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:53.712
so who knows where I would have been
without Coach?

1038
01:10:53.789 --> 01:10:57.225
He was my Dad's teammate
in the SEALs but after...

1039
01:10:57.292 --> 01:10:58.885
he ran a cable wakeboarding park.

1040
01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:02.453
Literally, I barely knew him
and he took me in.

1041
01:11:02.564 --> 01:11:06.125
And Sarah, she was the "it" girl.
Not mine, though.

1042
01:11:06.234 --> 01:11:10.728
Then wham, Triple-S, Hatteras,
but really... you.

1043
01:11:10.806 --> 01:11:13.935
And I told Sarah I think
I know what great should at least be.

1044
01:11:15.110 --> 01:11:17.408
So she's gone. She went home.

1045
01:11:17.479 --> 01:11:20.141
She and me are over.

1046
01:11:20.249 --> 01:11:22.684
We were never right.
From the beginning.

1047
01:11:22.784 --> 01:11:25.913
- I've got such a past...
- Who doesn't?

1048
01:11:25.988 --> 01:11:27.979
Sarah. She has everything.

1049
01:11:29.157 --> 01:11:32.286
Did you not hear me?
What I just said? Oh, my God!

1050
01:11:32.394 --> 01:11:35.159
I don't want to be like her,
like all the other normal girls?

1051
01:11:35.263 --> 01:11:37.595
- I just can't.
- Exactly!

1052
01:11:37.666 --> 01:11:40.328
You're amazing. Spontaneous and...

1053
01:11:40.435 --> 01:11:42.767
and confident and sweet.

1054
01:11:42.838 --> 01:11:47.571
And then battle-ready,
unpredictable, beautiful...

1055
01:11:50.078 --> 01:11:51.842
and I got all that in just a week.

1056
01:11:56.785 --> 01:11:58.776
If only you could see inside my brain.

1057
01:12:03.525 --> 01:12:07.621
Protect my heart if it's in your hands.

1058
01:12:10.532 --> 01:12:13.467
Will you protect mine, Sky?

1059
01:12:15.971 --> 01:12:17.962
Yes, Billy. I will.

1060
01:12:21.009 --> 01:12:22.408
You called me Billy.

1061
01:13:52.133 --> 01:13:53.692
<i>Welcome,
ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1062
01:13:53.769 --> 01:13:57.706
<i>to the Wind Voyager Triple-S invitational
kiteboarding championship,</i>

1063
01:13:57.773 --> 01:14:02.404
<i>located at the REAL Watersports facility
in Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.</i>

1064
01:14:02.477 --> 01:14:06.072
I'm Tony Smith, and along with me
for this great ride

1065
01:14:06.148 --> 01:14:10.346
is five-time Triple-S champion,
the grand dame of women's kiteboarding,

1066
01:14:10.452 --> 01:14:12.443
the incomparable Susi Mai.

1067
01:14:12.521 --> 01:14:15.013
Why, thank you for having me.
It's amazing to be back.

1068
01:14:15.123 --> 01:14:17.455
And what a beautiful day
here in the Outer Banks.

1069
01:14:17.526 --> 01:14:21.326
<i>The wind is out of the southwest,
a perfect 26-miles-per-hour.</i>

1070
01:14:21.429 --> 01:14:24.865
<i>The sliders are set up on the slick
and we're ready to go.</i>

1071
01:14:40.916 --> 01:14:43.351
<i>Perfect conditions
for the tournament today, Tony.</i>

1072
01:14:43.451 --> 01:14:44.782
<i>While the riders warm up,</i>

1073
01:14:44.853 --> 01:14:47.788
<i>let's go over the rules of the Triple-S.</i>

1074
01:14:47.856 --> 01:14:49.585
First there will be a series
of competitive heats.

1075
01:14:49.658 --> 01:14:52.150
<i>The riders go head to head
against one another</i>

1076
01:14:52.260 --> 01:14:54.092
<i>and based on the judges scores,</i>

1077
01:14:54.162 --> 01:14:56.995
<i>they either advance ultimately
to the finals heat</i>

1078
01:14:57.098 --> 01:14:59.931
or they take that long
and very lonely walk,

1079
01:15:00.002 --> 01:15:01.970
having been eliminated
from the competition.

1080
01:15:02.037 --> 01:15:04.972
That's right. The best 24 male
and female riders

1081
01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:06.701
<i>will be going up against each other,</i>

1082
01:15:06.808 --> 01:15:09.209
<i>but only three of them get to stand
on the podium,</i>

1083
01:15:09.311 --> 01:15:12.474
<i>plus, of course, the winner
of the Iconic Air award.</i>

1084
01:15:12.547 --> 01:15:15.312
Twenty-four down to three.
Oh, I'm nervous already!

1085
01:15:21.723 --> 01:15:23.248
<i>Well, the horn has sounded,</i>

1086
01:15:23.358 --> 01:15:25.986
<i>the warmups are over and here we go.</i>

1087
01:15:26.061 --> 01:15:28.553
The Wind Voyager Triple-S
is under way.

1088
01:16:33.228 --> 01:16:36.562
- Massive yard sale right there, Tony.
- Very uncharacteristic.

1089
01:16:49.778 --> 01:16:51.268
<i>That's it for today.</i>

1090
01:16:51.379 --> 01:16:53.871
<i>That wraps up
the preliminary heats of the Triple-S</i>

1091
01:16:53.949 --> 01:16:56.919
<i>and the standings are in.</i>

1092
01:16:56.985 --> 01:16:58.282
<i>The leaders in the men's division</i>

1093
01:16:58.386 --> 01:17:00.081
<i>are Alderic Amedee
and Skeeter Bowman,</i>

1094
01:17:00.155 --> 01:17:03.955
<i>and in the women's division,
Sensi Graves and Colleen Carroll.</i>

1095
01:17:04.059 --> 01:17:06.187
<i>Tune in tomorrow
for the championship finals.</i>

1096
01:17:15.837 --> 01:17:17.305
Sky.

1097
01:17:17.372 --> 01:17:20.808
- You nervous about tomorrow?
- Yeah.

1098
01:17:20.875 --> 01:17:24.470
Then it's all over, I guess.

1099
01:17:24.546 --> 01:17:25.809
Tomorrow.

1100
01:17:28.483 --> 01:17:30.349
No, Sky. It won't be over.

1101
01:17:34.022 --> 01:17:35.786
I've got to tell you something.

1102
01:17:35.857 --> 01:17:37.120
Yeah. Anything.

1103
01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:40.028
I got a ride.

1104
01:17:41.029 --> 01:17:42.793
What does that mean?

1105
01:17:42.864 --> 01:17:44.491
It's been a great week, but...

1106
01:17:44.566 --> 01:17:47.536
- What are you talking about?
- I'm leaving tomorrow morning.

1107
01:17:47.636 --> 01:17:49.832
No, no, no, no, no.

1108
01:17:49.904 --> 01:17:51.998
I've been thinking about it
and there's just no way.

1109
01:17:52.073 --> 01:17:54.167
Sky, no.
We made promises.

1110
01:17:54.242 --> 01:17:55.676
My past will catch up with me.

1111
01:17:55.744 --> 01:17:57.872
I don't care about your past.

1112
01:17:57.979 --> 01:17:59.743
We need... no...

1113
01:17:59.848 --> 01:18:01.577
I need to see this through.

1114
01:18:03.318 --> 01:18:05.412
I'll go quit. Right now.

1115
01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:07.579
Let's go. We'll get in the jeep
and we'll leave.

1116
01:18:07.689 --> 01:18:09.487
Billy, stop.

1117
01:18:09.557 --> 01:18:13.323
We will find our everywhere.
Just you and me.

1118
01:18:13.395 --> 01:18:14.885
I had a shitty childhood,

1119
01:18:14.996 --> 01:18:20.059
full of foster homes and creepy foster
fathers and brothers.

1120
01:18:20.168 --> 01:18:24.298
There's another guy...
I ran away with him.

1121
01:18:25.340 --> 01:18:27.001
I've conned people.

1122
01:18:27.075 --> 01:18:31.239
I had to get out,
I'm a better person than that.

1123
01:18:31.346 --> 01:18:33.508
But I'm always running.

1124
01:18:36.551 --> 01:18:40.351
I ran away from him a couple of days
before I met you at the diner.

1125
01:18:41.556 --> 01:18:44.184
And he's gonna come after me.

1126
01:18:44.259 --> 01:18:47.718
And he'll hurt you. And me.

1127
01:18:48.763 --> 01:18:51.198
And I can take it,

1128
01:18:51.266 --> 01:18:54.327
but I can't take it if he hurts you.

1129
01:18:58.740 --> 01:18:59.764
That's it?

1130
01:19:00.775 --> 01:19:01.742
Yeah.

1131
01:19:01.843 --> 01:19:03.072
That's it? Seriously?

1132
01:19:04.412 --> 01:19:07.404
You think I care about some guy?

1133
01:19:07.515 --> 01:19:10.450
I thought you were
gonna say something bad.

1134
01:19:10.552 --> 01:19:13.647
Oh, man, Sky, we will figure that out.
That is easy.

1135
01:19:14.956 --> 01:19:17.254
You're not going anywhere tomorrow.

1136
01:19:17.325 --> 01:19:18.759
Are you for real?

1137
01:19:21.162 --> 01:19:22.152
I got you.

1138
01:19:24.265 --> 01:19:26.256
We're gonna live out our truth.

1139
01:20:17.685 --> 01:20:19.585
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,

1140
01:20:19.654 --> 01:20:22.817
<i>to the final round
of the Triple-S invitational.</i>

1141
01:20:22.924 --> 01:20:24.915
<i>The competitive heats
have been whittled down,</i>

1142
01:20:24.993 --> 01:20:26.757
<i>the judges have been
tabulating scores,</i>

1143
01:20:26.828 --> 01:20:28.819
<i>and based on today's performances,</i>

1144
01:20:28.930 --> 01:20:32.764
<i>the men's and women's division winners
will be determined.</i>

1145
01:20:47.148 --> 01:20:49.207
Oh, and it looks like he's going
out the gates

1146
01:20:49.317 --> 01:20:51.479
with a huge trick landing too, Tony.

1147
01:20:51.552 --> 01:20:52.883
Very impressive, Susi.

1148
01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:06.524
Didn't quite make that one.

1149
01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:17.103
Wow. I mean, flawless.

1150
01:21:29.290 --> 01:21:30.621
Rain delay.

1151
01:21:34.362 --> 01:21:37.957
Waiting for wind.
The story of my life.

1152
01:21:45.907 --> 01:21:48.376
- Hey, I gotta go.
- Okay, bye.

1153
01:21:48.443 --> 01:21:49.638
Hey! Billy! Hey!

1154
01:21:54.616 --> 01:21:55.811
Whoa ho ho!

1155
01:21:56.918 --> 01:21:58.408
How you feeling?

1156
01:22:00.588 --> 01:22:02.989
- Nervous.
- Ditto that.

1157
01:22:03.091 --> 01:22:05.492
<i>Questione.</i>

1158
01:22:05.593 --> 01:22:06.924
What you got after Triple-S?

1159
01:22:08.296 --> 01:22:09.923
Funny. I was just talking about that.

1160
01:22:11.933 --> 01:22:13.560
Hey, bro, look at me.

1161
01:22:13.635 --> 01:22:16.832
You got this. Just breathe.

1162
01:22:22.443 --> 01:22:24.070
<i>Well, Susi, the wind is picking up</i>

1163
01:22:24.145 --> 01:22:27.115
<i>and that horn means
the rain delay is over.</i>

1164
01:22:27.215 --> 01:22:29.047
We're good to go, Uncle Jake.

1165
01:22:30.385 --> 01:22:32.149
Good to go.

1166
01:22:32.253 --> 01:22:33.743
<i>Let's get back to the action.</i>

1167
01:22:33.821 --> 01:22:35.789
A strong competitor in the competition,

1168
01:22:35.890 --> 01:22:38.257
Wind Voyager's own
Skeeter Bowman.

1169
01:23:14.829 --> 01:23:16.957
And now the moment
we've all been waiting for.

1170
01:23:17.031 --> 01:23:18.157
From Cannes, France,

1171
01:23:18.266 --> 01:23:22.965
the Frenchman and reigning
world champion, Alderic Amedee.

1172
01:23:58.439 --> 01:24:00.931
Alderic really showed up.
You should be proud.

1173
01:24:01.042 --> 01:24:04.171
And next up is the rookie
of the competition, winner of the Open,

1174
01:24:04.245 --> 01:24:05.576
<i>from Dallas, Texas-</i>

1175
01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:09.412
<i>Billy Johnson Jr.</i>

1176
01:24:09.517 --> 01:24:11.007
Go Billy!

1177
01:24:12.754 --> 01:24:13.744
Come on, Billy!

1178
01:24:26.234 --> 01:24:27.360
Whoa!

1179
01:24:49.190 --> 01:24:50.089
Hey, look!

1180
01:24:51.459 --> 01:24:53.018
Come on,
come on, come on!

1181
01:24:58.533 --> 01:24:59.523
Land, Billy, land it!

1182
01:25:05.973 --> 01:25:08.271
Yes! Yes, yes!

1183
01:25:10.945 --> 01:25:13.209
Oh! Whoa!

1184
01:25:15.783 --> 01:25:17.251
Nine.

1185
01:25:18.453 --> 01:25:19.716
Nine hundred.

1186
01:25:21.789 --> 01:25:23.484
Yeah. Copy that.

1187
01:25:23.591 --> 01:25:25.958
And that's the end of the competition.
We're done.

1188
01:25:26.027 --> 01:25:28.086
Well, I feel sorry
for the judges, Susi.

1189
01:25:28.162 --> 01:25:31.257
I don't know how they're gonna narrow it
down to three, much less pick a winner.

1190
01:25:31.332 --> 01:25:34.427
<i>For OBXS, Tony Smith and Susi Mai.</i>

1191
01:25:34.502 --> 01:25:36.937
<i>Stick around for the awards,
coming up next.</i>

1192
01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:41.975
Oh, Billy Johnson Jr.

1193
01:25:48.516 --> 01:25:51.008
What the fu...
You speak French.

1194
01:25:59.861 --> 01:26:01.625
All right.

1195
01:26:01.696 --> 01:26:05.633
And the first place
in the female division goes to...

1196
01:26:05.700 --> 01:26:07.190
Colleen Carroll!

1197
01:26:08.736 --> 01:26:11.535
All right!

1198
01:26:15.376 --> 01:26:18.835
Those are your women's division champions.

1199
01:26:20.581 --> 01:26:23.050
Thank you, ladies. Thank you, Susi.

1200
01:26:23.151 --> 01:26:25.518
Well, I have to get back
to the broadcast booth,

1201
01:26:25.586 --> 01:26:29.181
so I'm gonna turn over the honors
to announce the men's division champion

1202
01:26:29.290 --> 01:26:31.281
to Wind Voyager's Jake Wind.

1203
01:26:31.359 --> 01:26:33.123
Yeah, hey!

1204
01:26:33.194 --> 01:26:36.357
<i>Thank you, Tony.
Thank you, Susi.</i>

1205
01:26:36.464 --> 01:26:38.125
All right, the men's division,
let's get to it.

1206
01:26:38.199 --> 01:26:39.189
In third place...

1207
01:26:41.502 --> 01:26:44.995
Skeeter Bowman.

1208
01:26:48.709 --> 01:26:49.972
Way to go, Skeets.

1209
01:26:52.646 --> 01:26:53.738
In second place...

1210
01:26:58.486 --> 01:26:59.817
Mighty Sam Light.

1211
01:27:11.332 --> 01:27:12.925
And last,

1212
01:27:13.034 --> 01:27:14.695
<i>but not least,</i>

1213
01:27:14.769 --> 01:27:15.930
<i>our champion...</i>

1214
01:27:16.037 --> 01:27:18.267
first place...

1215
01:27:18.372 --> 01:27:21.171
Alderic Amedee.

1216
01:27:24.412 --> 01:27:25.902
Boo!

1217
01:27:31.152 --> 01:27:32.586
No, no, no. Give it up.

1218
01:27:32.653 --> 01:27:35.145
Send it for him. Come on.

1219
01:27:35.256 --> 01:27:38.123
I really do love you guys.
Thank you.

1220
01:27:40.061 --> 01:27:42.894
The men's champions!

1221
01:27:46.934 --> 01:27:49.426
All right. We have one more award,

1222
01:27:49.503 --> 01:27:52.632
and that is the Iconic Air Award,
sponsored by Wind Voyager.

1223
01:27:52.740 --> 01:27:55.505
Wind Voyager is proud to have
the best kite tours in the world

1224
01:27:55.610 --> 01:27:57.009
on, get a load of this...

1225
01:27:57.111 --> 01:27:59.808
the 95-foot Cat <i>The Cartouche.</i>

1226
01:28:02.350 --> 01:28:03.784
The Iconic Air award goes to that kiter

1227
01:28:03.851 --> 01:28:05.910
who has the most innovative
trick of the year.

1228
01:28:05.987 --> 01:28:09.821
This year's Iconic Air Award winner is-

1229
01:28:09.924 --> 01:28:10.914
Aubrey, will you help me out?

1230
01:28:16.163 --> 01:28:18.495
Rookie sensation Billy Johnson Jr.

1231
01:28:18.599 --> 01:28:19.532
Oh, my God!

1232
01:28:21.936 --> 01:28:23.995
What? What?!

1233
01:28:24.105 --> 01:28:26.938
Are you serious?

1234
01:28:27.008 --> 01:28:30.000
Let's have a drink for our kid! Billy!

1235
01:28:30.111 --> 01:28:31.510
Come on up, Billy.

1236
01:28:37.685 --> 01:28:40.313
- Skeeter!
- Well played.

1237
01:28:41.322 --> 01:28:42.414
Good job, man!

1238
01:28:46.327 --> 01:28:47.920
Good job, Billy.

1239
01:28:47.995 --> 01:28:50.293
Oh, my God. Yeah!

1240
01:28:54.135 --> 01:28:56.433
Whoo! Billy! Yeah!

1241
01:28:56.504 --> 01:28:59.838
Uh, look, I-I just want
to say thank you, Jake Wind,

1242
01:28:59.940 --> 01:29:02.034
and to everyone who's been
supporting me along the way.

1243
01:29:02.143 --> 01:29:04.305
You guys have been
the best fans. Thank you.

1244
01:29:04.378 --> 01:29:07.712
Hey, not bad for a cowboy, huh?

1245
01:29:13.787 --> 01:29:15.846
He earned it. Don't you think?

1246
01:29:31.739 --> 01:29:33.639
I was wondering how long it was gonna
take for you to call me.

1247
01:29:33.707 --> 01:29:35.334
Jake, it's Richard.

1248
01:29:35.409 --> 01:29:37.343
I've been watching OBXS

1249
01:29:37.411 --> 01:29:40.506
and I just want you to tell me
that you're signing that kid.

1250
01:29:40.581 --> 01:29:42.709
Oh, yeah. Done and done.
And the best thing is,

1251
01:29:42.783 --> 01:29:44.217
he's even a better person
than he is a kiter.

1252
01:29:44.285 --> 01:29:45.616
<i>Outstanding young man.</i>

1253
01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:48.189
Well, I hope there's room
for another sponsor.

1254
01:29:48.255 --> 01:29:50.622
Um, like maybe Virgin, perhaps?

1255
01:29:50.725 --> 01:29:52.625
You owe me, Jake.

1256
01:29:52.726 --> 01:29:54.455
<i>I've always got room for you. Take care.</i>

1257
01:30:00.701 --> 01:30:02.066
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

1258
01:30:02.136 --> 01:30:03.968
<i>Excusez-moi,</i> please, please,
please, <i>excusez-moi.</i>

1259
01:30:04.071 --> 01:30:05.402
On behalf of Alderic Amedee,

1260
01:30:05.472 --> 01:30:09.033
thank you to REAL Watersports
and Triple-S,

1261
01:30:09.109 --> 01:30:12.943
Jason Sleezak, Matt Nuzzo and Trip Forman.

1262
01:30:18.319 --> 01:30:20.583
And a big thank you to all the fans.

1263
01:30:20.654 --> 01:30:21.883
Thank you!

1264
01:30:24.558 --> 01:30:28.392
To all the pros for creating moments
that we will never forget,

1265
01:30:28.462 --> 01:30:33.298
but there is one thing that I will never
forget about this championship.

1266
01:30:33.401 --> 01:30:34.630
Jake Wind, come here.

1267
01:30:40.641 --> 01:30:44.407
The other day, you asked me a question
and I didn't give you an answer,

1268
01:30:44.478 --> 01:30:46.913
but today I'm ready to say...

1269
01:30:46.981 --> 01:30:48.574
What?

1270
01:30:49.583 --> 01:30:50.778
Yes, I will marry you.

1271
01:31:04.431 --> 01:31:06.832
Well, that concludes the Triple-S
for this year.

1272
01:31:06.934 --> 01:31:09.130
We'll see you all next year!

1273
01:31:17.077 --> 01:31:18.408
Let's go party!

1274
01:31:42.703 --> 01:31:45.195
Where is he?

1275
01:31:45.306 --> 01:31:46.796
- Let's get under way.
- Right-oh.

1276
01:31:46.874 --> 01:31:48.399
- We've got to go.
- Five more minutes.

1277
01:31:48.509 --> 01:31:51.410
I don't have five minutes.
We're gonna lose our berth in Ibiza.

1278
01:31:51.512 --> 01:31:54.174
Guys, say goodbye to Palma.

1279
01:31:54.248 --> 01:31:56.580
Bye, Palma.

1280
01:31:56.684 --> 01:31:58.914
Angelo. I'll take over
when we're under way.

1281
01:32:09.430 --> 01:32:11.489
Ooh, thank you.

1282
01:32:13.701 --> 01:32:14.691
Oh, my God!

1283
01:32:14.768 --> 01:32:15.758
Huh?

1284
01:32:17.237 --> 01:32:18.398
Unbelievable.

1285
01:32:21.108 --> 01:32:23.543
- Jake! He made it!
- What?

1286
01:32:25.379 --> 01:32:28.246
- Angelo, cut the engines, drop anchor.
- Copy that.

1287
01:32:42.997 --> 01:32:44.328
Come on, girls, let's go.

1288
01:32:45.499 --> 01:32:46.898
Alderic is here!

1289
01:32:48.936 --> 01:32:51.598
Ah, no, my old sponsor
didn't take the news so well

1290
01:32:51.705 --> 01:32:53.036
about me joining Wind Voyager.

1291
01:32:53.107 --> 01:32:55.007
I was worried you changed your mind.

1292
01:32:55.075 --> 01:32:57.567
No. Alderic's word is his bond.

1293
01:32:57.678 --> 01:33:00.443
Here. Welcome.

1294
01:33:01.949 --> 01:33:03.713
Nice, hey, <i>merci.</i>

1295
01:33:03.784 --> 01:33:06.082
And, uh, who are your friends?

1296
01:33:06.186 --> 01:33:09.952
Uh... This is Bella

1297
01:33:10.057 --> 01:33:11.525
and Isabella.

1298
01:33:11.592 --> 01:33:14.459
I need some champagne.
I'll show you where your cabin is.

1299
01:33:21.702 --> 01:33:23.192
Yo, Alderic.

1300
01:33:23.270 --> 01:33:25.864
You're an animal.

1301
01:33:25.940 --> 01:33:27.271
Whoa, <i>putain!</i>

1302
01:33:27.374 --> 01:33:28.637
Hey, this boat is insane.

1303
01:33:28.742 --> 01:33:30.471
Yeah, bro. Your room is down there.

1304
01:33:30.578 --> 01:33:32.808
Really? Hey, ladies.

1305
01:33:46.427 --> 01:33:47.588
Sounds like bubbly.

1306
01:33:52.266 --> 01:33:54.496
Hey. Got enough for me?

1307
01:34:01.642 --> 01:34:04.839
Darling, everything I have is all yours.

1308
01:34:10.150 --> 01:34:11.675
To us.

1309
01:34:26.967 --> 01:34:29.026
Mm...

1310
01:34:37.378 --> 01:34:38.846
Is this part of your everywhere?

1311
01:34:40.681 --> 01:34:42.410
Anywhere with you is my everywhere.

1312
01:34:43.884 --> 01:34:46.376
When I look in your eyes,
I feel so safe.

1313
01:34:47.521 --> 01:34:49.046
I got you.

1314
01:34:50.057 --> 01:34:51.286
And I got you.

1315
01:34:52.359 --> 01:34:56.353
Wait, did you say
when you look <i>in</i> my eyes?

1316
01:34:57.898 --> 01:34:59.992
Mm-hmm.

1317
01:35:05.906 --> 01:35:07.965
What was that?

1318
01:35:08.042 --> 01:35:10.841
- Auto-pilot.
- Good.
