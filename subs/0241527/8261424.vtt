1
00:01:15.558 --> 00:01:20.563
I should've known that you would
be here, Professor McGonagall.

2
00:01:31.771 --> 00:01:34.938
Good evening, Professor Dumbledore.

3
00:01:37.436 --> 00:01:40.433
Are the rumors true, Albus?

4
00:01:40.682 --> 00:01:45.887
I'm afraid so, professor.
The good and the bad.

5
00:01:46.097 --> 00:01:49.354
- And the boy?
- Hagrid is bringing him.

6
00:01:49.603 --> 00:01:53.520
Is it wise to trust Hagrid
with something so important?

7
00:01:54.019 --> 00:01:58.934
Professor, I would trust Hagrid
with my life.

8
00:02:17.765 --> 00:02:21.891
Professor Dumbledore, sir.
Professor McGonagall.

9
00:02:22.101 --> 00:02:25.977
- No problems, I trust, Hagrid?
- No, sir.

10
00:02:26.187 --> 00:02:30.642
Little tyke fell asleep
as we were flying over Bristol.

11
00:02:31.432 --> 00:02:33.929
Try not to wake him.

12
00:02:34.728 --> 00:02:36.806
There you go.

13
00:02:42.221 --> 00:02:46.766
Do you really think it's safe,
leaving him with these people?

14
00:02:46.976 --> 00:02:52.221
I've watched them all day.
They're the worst sort of Muggles.

15
00:02:52.471 --> 00:02:56.437
- They really are...
- The only family he has.

16
00:02:56.686 --> 00:03:01.601
He'll be famous. Every child
in our world will know his name.

17
00:03:01.851 --> 00:03:03.559
Exactly.

18
00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.055
He's far better off growing up
away from all of that.

19
00:03:10.513 --> 00:03:13.270
Until he's ready.

20
00:03:25.268 --> 00:03:30.762
There, there, Hagrid.
It's not really goodbye, after all.

21
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.099
Good luck...

22
00:03:44.768 --> 00:03:47.266
Harry Potter.

23
00:04:04.808 --> 00:04:07.805
Up. Get up!

24
00:04:10.433 --> 00:04:11.931
Now!

25
00:04:25.597 --> 00:04:28.974
Wake up, cousin!
We're going to the zoo!

26
00:04:40.143 --> 00:04:45.437
- Here he comes, the birthday boy.
- Happy birthday, son.

27
00:04:47.266 --> 00:04:50.432
Cook breakfast.
And try not to burn anything.

28
00:04:50.642 --> 00:04:55.597
- Yes, Aunt Petunia.
- I want everything to be perfect...

29
00:04:55.807 --> 00:04:58.724
for my Dudley's special day!

30
00:04:58.934 --> 00:05:03.929
- Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy.
- Yes, Uncle Vernon.

31
00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:08.265
Aren't they wonderful, darling?

32
00:05:10.432 --> 00:05:13.929
- How many are there?
- 36. Counted them myself.

33
00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:17.346
36? But last year I had 37!

34
00:05:17.555 --> 00:05:21.431
- But some are bigger than last year's.
- I don't care!

35
00:05:21.641 --> 00:05:24.139
This is what we're going to do.

36
00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:28.724
We're going to buy you two
new presents. How's that, pumpkin?

37
00:05:30.682 --> 00:05:36.307
It should be a lovely day at the zoo.
I'm really looking forward to it.

38
00:05:39.603 --> 00:05:41.431
I'm warning you now, boy.

39
00:05:41.641 --> 00:05:45.138
Any funny business, any at all...

40
00:05:45.348 --> 00:05:48.394
and you won't have
any meals for a week.

41
00:05:49.144 --> 00:05:50.892
Get in.

42
00:05:58.055 --> 00:06:00.472
Make it move.

43
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.848
Move!

44
00:06:05.098 --> 00:06:07.555
- Move!
- He's asleep!

45
00:06:07.765 --> 00:06:10.313
He's boring.

46
00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.179
Sorry about him.

47
00:06:14.388 --> 00:06:18.105
He doesn't understand
what it's like, lying there...

48
00:06:18.684 --> 00:06:22.470
watching people press
their ugly faces in on you.

49
00:06:25.228 --> 00:06:27.895
Can you hear me?

50
00:06:30.392 --> 00:06:34.438
It's just, I've never talked
to a snake before.

51
00:06:34.888 --> 00:06:36.307
Do you?

52
00:06:36.516 --> 00:06:40.642
Do you talk to people often?

53
00:06:41.771 --> 00:06:45.058
You're from Burma, aren't you?
Was it nice there?

54
00:06:45.268 --> 00:06:47.555
Do you miss your family?

55
00:06:50.432 --> 00:06:55.138
I see. That's me as well.
I never knew my parents either.

56
00:06:55.347 --> 00:07:00.352
Mummy, Dad, you won't believe
what this snake is doing!

57
00:07:23.429 --> 00:07:25.437
Thanks.

58
00:07:25.637 --> 00:07:27.056
Anytime.

59
00:07:30.392 --> 00:07:32.310
Snake!

60
00:07:47.765 --> 00:07:51.102
Mum! Mummy! Help me!

61
00:07:51.351 --> 00:07:54.478
My darling boy!
How did you get in there?

62
00:07:54.978 --> 00:08:00.063
Who did this? How did you get
in there? Is there a snake?

63
00:08:04.938 --> 00:08:10.222
It's all right, sweetheart.
We'll get you out of these cold clothes.

64
00:08:11.971 --> 00:08:14.888
- What happened?
- I swear, I don't know!

65
00:08:15.098 --> 00:08:18.974
The glass was there
and then it was gone, like magic.

66
00:08:23.389 --> 00:08:26.187
There's no such thing as magic.

67
00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:05.597
Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk.

68
00:09:05.807 --> 00:09:09.014
- Dad, look! Harry's got a letter!
- It's mine!

69
00:09:09.223 --> 00:09:11.971
Yours? Who'd be writing to you?

70
00:09:43.229 --> 00:09:47.765
No more mail through this letterbox.

71
00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:02.770
Have a lovely day at the office, dear.

72
00:10:05.637 --> 00:10:08.304
Shoo! Go on.

73
00:10:33.139 --> 00:10:36.017
Fine day, Sunday.

74
00:10:36.646 --> 00:10:41.311
In my opinion, best day of the week.
Why is that, Dudley?

75
00:10:41.521 --> 00:10:45.937
- Because there's no post on Sundays?
- Right you are, Harry!

76
00:10:46.146 --> 00:10:48.894
No post on Sunday.

77
00:10:50.312 --> 00:10:54.228
No blasted letters today! No, sir.

78
00:10:54.808 --> 00:10:59.763
Not one single bloody letter. Not one!

79
00:11:08.184 --> 00:11:12.060
No, sir, not one blasted, miserable...

80
00:11:23.559 --> 00:11:25.767
Make it stop, please!

81
00:11:27.555 --> 00:11:29.473
Stop it!

82
00:11:33.599 --> 00:11:36.556
Mummy, what's happening?

83
00:11:39.973 --> 00:11:44.308
Give me that! Give me that letter!

84
00:11:46.936 --> 00:11:48.684
Get off!

85
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:56.596
They're my letters! Let go of me!

86
00:11:57.435 --> 00:12:00.432
That's it! We're going away!

87
00:12:01.101 --> 00:12:04.768
Far away, where they can't find us!

88
00:12:04.978 --> 00:12:08.224
Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?

89
00:12:43.099 --> 00:12:45.387
Make a wish, Harry.

90
00:13:01.471 --> 00:13:03.519
Who's there?

91
00:13:15.687 --> 00:13:18.104
Sorry about that.

92
00:13:24.977 --> 00:13:29.563
I demand that you leave at once.
You are breaking and entering.

93
00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:35.267
Dry up, Dursley, you great prune.

94
00:13:40.472 --> 00:13:43.978
I haven't seen you
since you was a baby, Harry.

95
00:13:44.188 --> 00:13:48.724
You're a bit more along than I expected.
Particularly in the middle.

96
00:13:48.933 --> 00:13:51.771
I'm not Harry.

97
00:13:53.599 --> 00:13:57.305
- I am.
- Well, of course you are.

98
00:13:58.104 --> 00:13:59.683
Got something for you.

99
00:13:59.892 --> 00:14:05.477
Afraid I sat on it, but I imagine
it'll taste fine just the same.

100
00:14:07.974 --> 00:14:11.391
Baked it myself, words and all.

101
00:14:16.935 --> 00:14:17.974
Thank you.

102
00:14:18.224 --> 00:14:22.350
It's not every day your young man
turns 11, is it?

103
00:14:37.515 --> 00:14:41.641
Excuse me, but who are you?

104
00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:46.766
Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys
and Grounds at Hogwarts.

105
00:14:47.015 --> 00:14:50.722
- Of course, you know about Hogwarts.
- Sorry, no.

106
00:14:51.311 --> 00:14:56.226
Didn't you ever wonder where
your mum and dad learned it all?

107
00:14:56.476 --> 00:14:57.854
Learned what?

108
00:14:58.054 --> 00:15:00.602
You're a wizard, Harry.

109
00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:03.848
- I'm a what?
- A wizard.

110
00:15:04.058 --> 00:15:07.095
A good one, I'd wager,
once you're trained up.

111
00:15:07.355 --> 00:15:10.222
No, you've made a mistake.
I mean...

112
00:15:10.432 --> 00:15:13.429
I can't be a wizard.

113
00:15:14.098 --> 00:15:18.853
I mean, I'm just Harry. Just Harry.

114
00:15:19.932 --> 00:15:23.938
Well, Just Harry, did you ever
make anything happen?

115
00:15:24.138 --> 00:15:28.813
Anything you couldn't explain,
when you were angry or scared?

116
00:15:45.187 --> 00:15:48.304
"Dear Mr. Potter,
We are pleased to accept you...

117
00:15:48.514 --> 00:15:51.770
at Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry."

118
00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:56.935
He will not be going! We swore
we'd put a stop to all this rubbish.

119
00:15:57.145 --> 00:16:01.351
You knew? You knew all along
and you never told me?

120
00:16:01.561 --> 00:16:04.638
Of course we knew.
How could you not be?

121
00:16:04.847 --> 00:16:08.554
My perfect sister being who she was.

122
00:16:08.763 --> 00:16:14.728
My mother and father were so proud
the day she got her letter.

123
00:16:14.937 --> 00:16:19.103
"We have a witch in the family.
Isn't it wonderful?"

124
00:16:19.313 --> 00:16:22.979
I was the only one to see her
for what she was.

125
00:16:23.179 --> 00:16:24.937
A freak!

126
00:16:25.137 --> 00:16:28.104
Then she met that Potter,
and then she had you...

127
00:16:28.304 --> 00:16:34.018
and I knew you would be the same.
Just as strange, just as abnormal.

128
00:16:34.228 --> 00:16:39.223
And then she got herself blown up,
and we got landed with you.

129
00:16:39.433 --> 00:16:43.429
Blown up? You told me
my parents died in a car crash.

130
00:16:43.689 --> 00:16:47.974
A car crash? A car crash killed
Lily and James Potter?

131
00:16:48.184 --> 00:16:52.100
- We had to say something.
- It's an outrage! A scandal!

132
00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:54.767
He'll not be going.

133
00:16:54.977 --> 00:16:58.304
A great Muggle like you
is going to stop him?

134
00:16:58.474 --> 00:16:59.513
Muggle?

135
00:16:59.852 --> 00:17:03.848
Non-magic folk. This boy's had
his name down since he were born.

136
00:17:04.058 --> 00:17:07.934
He's going to the finest school
of witchcraft and wizardry.

137
00:17:08.144 --> 00:17:14.058
He'll be under the finest headmaster
Hogwarts has seen, Albus Dumbledore.

138
00:17:14.268 --> 00:17:19.063
I will not pay to have a crackpot
old fool teach him magic tricks.

139
00:17:19.263 --> 00:17:23.808
Never insult Albus Dumbledore...

140
00:17:24.018 --> 00:17:26.056
in front of me.

141
00:17:43.938 --> 00:17:49.183
I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell
anyone at Hogwarts about that.

142
00:17:49.433 --> 00:17:53.519
- I'm not allowed to do magic.
- Okay.

143
00:17:54.807 --> 00:17:57.804
We're a bit behind schedule.
Best be off.

144
00:18:03.978 --> 00:18:07.185
Unless you'd rather stay, of course.

145
00:18:21.471 --> 00:18:24.767
"All students must be equipped with...

146
00:18:24.977 --> 00:18:27.894
one standard size 2
pewter cauldron...

147
00:18:28.104 --> 00:18:33.888
and may bring, if they desire,
either an owl, a cat or a toad."

148
00:18:34.138 --> 00:18:36.725
Can we find all this in London?

149
00:18:36.935 --> 00:18:39.313
If you know where to go.

150
00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:05.017
Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?

151
00:19:05.227 --> 00:19:09.103
No, thanks, Tom.
I'm on official Hogwarts business.

152
00:19:09.313 --> 00:19:12.390
Just helping Harry buy
his school supplies.

153
00:19:12.639 --> 00:19:16.186
Bless my soul.
It's Harry Potter!

154
00:19:20.472 --> 00:19:23.938
Welcome back, Mr. Potter.
Welcome back.

155
00:19:24.138 --> 00:19:28.474
Doris Crockford. I can't believe
I'm meeting you at last.

156
00:19:28.933 --> 00:19:34.188
Harry Potter. Can't tell you
how pleased I am to meet you.

157
00:19:34.388 --> 00:19:36.935
Hello, professor. I didn't see you.

158
00:19:37.145 --> 00:19:42.140
Professor Quirrell will be your
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

159
00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:44.767
Oh, nice to meet you.

160
00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:48.104
Fearfully fascinating subject.

161
00:19:48.304 --> 00:19:52.929
Not that you need it, eh, Potter?

162
00:19:53.848 --> 00:19:58.014
Yes, well, must be going now.
Lots to buy.

163
00:19:58.224 --> 00:19:59.972
Goodbye.

164
00:20:02.679 --> 00:20:06.266
- See, Harry? You're famous.
- But why am I famous?

165
00:20:06.476 --> 00:20:09.932
All those people,
how is it they know who I am?

166
00:20:10.142 --> 00:20:13.938
I'm not sure I'm the right person
to tell you that.

167
00:20:30.931 --> 00:20:34.687
Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.

168
00:20:51.021 --> 00:20:53.518
Here, you get your quills and ink.

169
00:20:53.768 --> 00:20:57.684
Over there, all your bits and bobs
for doing wizardry.

170
00:21:22.519 --> 00:21:24.767
It's a world-class racing broom.

171
00:21:24.977 --> 00:21:28.853
Look at it! The new Nimbus 2000!

172
00:21:29.103 --> 00:21:32.390
It's the fastest model yet.

173
00:21:36.096 --> 00:21:40.681
But how am I to pay for all this?
I haven't any money.

174
00:21:40.891 --> 00:21:44.268
There's your money.
Gringotts, the wizard bank.

175
00:21:44.477 --> 00:21:49.972
Ain't no safer place, not one.
Except perhaps Hogwarts.

176
00:22:02.599 --> 00:22:06.595
Hagrid, what exactly
are these things?

177
00:22:06.805 --> 00:22:12.060
They're goblins. Clever as they come,
but not the most friendly of beasts.

178
00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:14.228
Best stay close.

179
00:22:18.264 --> 00:22:21.930
Mr. Harry Potter wishes
to make a withdrawal.

180
00:22:26.146 --> 00:22:29.313
And does Mr. Harry Potter
have his key?

181
00:22:30.272 --> 00:22:33.478
Wait a minute.
Got it here somewhere.

182
00:22:36.306 --> 00:22:39.143
Ha! There's the little devil.

183
00:22:39.352 --> 00:22:42.230
And there's something else as well.

184
00:22:43.478 --> 00:22:46.805
Professor Dumbledore gave me this.

185
00:22:50.851 --> 00:22:55.936
It's about You-Know-What
in vault you-know-which.

186
00:22:57.225 --> 00:22:59.183
Very well.

187
00:23:04.387 --> 00:23:07.225
Vault 687.

188
00:23:09.143 --> 00:23:11.430
Lamp, please.

189
00:23:19.932 --> 00:23:21.271
Key, please.

190
00:23:44.687 --> 00:23:48.433
Did you think your parents
would leave you with nothing?

191
00:23:49.722 --> 00:23:53.438
- Vault 713.
- What's in there, Hagrid?

192
00:23:53.638 --> 00:23:57.804
Can't tell you.
Hogwarts business. Very secret.

193
00:23:58.054 --> 00:23:59.602
Stand back.

194
00:24:27.854 --> 00:24:30.641
Best not to mention this to anyone.

195
00:24:39.063 --> 00:24:42.979
I still need a wand.

196
00:24:43.179 --> 00:24:46.605
You want Ollivanders.
There ain't no place better.

197
00:24:47.304 --> 00:24:52.429
Run along there and wait.
I got one more thing to do.

198
00:25:10.391 --> 00:25:12.229
Hello?

199
00:25:15.187 --> 00:25:17.015
Hello?

200
00:25:20.521 --> 00:25:24.807
I wondered when
I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter.

201
00:25:32.599 --> 00:25:34.807
It seems only yesterday...

202
00:25:35.057 --> 00:25:40.891
that your mother and father were
in here buying their first wands.

203
00:25:47.554 --> 00:25:49.852
Here we are.

204
00:25:58.433 --> 00:26:00.971
Give it a wave.

205
00:26:07.434 --> 00:26:09.972
Apparently not.

206
00:26:17.394 --> 00:26:19.602
Perhaps...

207
00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:23.438
this.

208
00:26:30.471 --> 00:26:35.097
No, no, definitely not.
No matter.

209
00:26:42.309 --> 00:26:43.938
I wonder...

210
00:27:13.098 --> 00:27:15.396
Curious.

211
00:27:15.596 --> 00:27:18.513
Very curious.

212
00:27:18.723 --> 00:27:21.850
Sorry, but what's curious?

213
00:27:23.558 --> 00:27:26.855
I remember every wand
I've ever sold, Mr. Potter.

214
00:27:27.055 --> 00:27:29.812
It so happens that the phoenix...

215
00:27:30.022 --> 00:27:34.727
whose tail feather resides
in your wand, gave another feather.

216
00:27:35.146 --> 00:27:38.223
Just one other.

217
00:27:38.433 --> 00:27:42.769
It is curious that you should
be destined for this wand...

218
00:27:43.019 --> 00:27:48.683
when its brother
gave you that scar.

219
00:27:50.521 --> 00:27:53.728
And who owned that wand?

220
00:27:54.557 --> 00:27:56.975
We do not speak his name.

221
00:27:57.434 --> 00:28:00.931
The wand chooses
the wizard, Mr. Potter.

222
00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:04.137
It's not always clear why.

223
00:28:04.517 --> 00:28:08.014
But I think it is clear...

224
00:28:08.223 --> 00:28:12.139
that we can expect
great things from you.

225
00:28:12.349 --> 00:28:16.605
After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named...

226
00:28:16.855 --> 00:28:19.512
did great things.

227
00:28:19.722 --> 00:28:21.730
Terrible...

228
00:28:22.179 --> 00:28:25.436
yes, but great.

229
00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:33.098
Harry! Harry!

230
00:28:33.478 --> 00:28:35.846
Happy birthday.

231
00:28:42.979 --> 00:28:46.475
You all right, Harry?
You seem very quiet.

232
00:28:46.855 --> 00:28:52.429
He killed my parents, didn't he?
The one who gave me this.

233
00:28:52.639 --> 00:28:56.265
You know, Hagrid. I know you do.

234
00:29:00.141 --> 00:29:04.687
First, and understand this
because it's very important:

235
00:29:04.897 --> 00:29:07.434
Not all wizards are good.

236
00:29:07.644 --> 00:29:10.141
Some of them go bad.
A few years ago...

237
00:29:10.351 --> 00:29:15.346
there was a wizard who went as bad
as you can go. His name was V...

238
00:29:15.556 --> 00:29:19.182
- His name was V...
- Maybe if you wrote it down?

239
00:29:19.392 --> 00:29:21.270
No, I can't spell it.

240
00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:25.726
- All right, Voldemort.
- Voldemort?

241
00:29:29.682 --> 00:29:31.930
It was dark times, Harry.

242
00:29:34.227 --> 00:29:37.354
<i>Voldemort started</i>
<i>to gather some followers.</i>

243
00:29:37.604 --> 00:29:40.930
<i>Brought them over to the Dark Side.</i>

244
00:29:42.309 --> 00:29:45.436
<i>Anyone that stood up to him</i>
<i>ended up dead.</i>

245
00:29:46.555 --> 00:29:49.602
<i>Your parents fought against him.</i>

246
00:29:49.812 --> 00:29:53.598
<i>But nobody lived once</i>
<i>he decided to kill them.</i>

247
00:29:57.973 --> 00:30:00.561
<i>Nobody, not one.</i>

248
00:30:00.771 --> 00:30:03.138
<i>Except you.</i>

249
00:30:05.146 --> 00:30:09.262
Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?

250
00:30:09.722 --> 00:30:13.888
Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut
on your forehead, Harry.

251
00:30:14.187 --> 00:30:19.931
A mark like that only comes from being
touched by a curse, an evil curse.

252
00:30:20.141 --> 00:30:23.768
What happened to V?
To You-Know-Who?

253
00:30:24.896 --> 00:30:28.263
Well, some say he died.

254
00:30:28.473 --> 00:30:30.890
Codswallop, in my opinion.

255
00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:34.347
Nope, I reckon he's out there still...

256
00:30:34.557 --> 00:30:37.514
too tired to carry on.

257
00:30:37.724 --> 00:30:43.138
But one thing's certain. Something
about you stumped him that night.

258
00:30:43.388 --> 00:30:47.644
That's why you're famous.
That's why everybody knows your name.

259
00:30:48.103 --> 00:30:51.770
You're the boy who lived.

260
00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:03.808
What are you looking at?

261
00:31:05.556 --> 00:31:07.554
Blimey, is that the time?

262
00:31:07.764 --> 00:31:11.770
I'm gonna have to leave you.
Dumbledore will be wanting his...

263
00:31:11.979 --> 00:31:16.854
Well, he'll be wanting to see me.
Your train leaves in 10 minutes.

264
00:31:17.054 --> 00:31:22.389
Here's your ticket. Stick to your ticket,
that's very important.

265
00:31:25.266 --> 00:31:27.514
"Platform 93/4"?

266
00:31:27.724 --> 00:31:32.519
But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake.
This says platform 93/4.

267
00:31:32.729 --> 00:31:36.055
There's no such thing, is there?

268
00:31:54.557 --> 00:31:56.145
Sorry.

269
00:31:57.644 --> 00:32:00.391
Excuse me. Excuse me.

270
00:32:00.601 --> 00:32:02.139
On your left.

271
00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:06.185
Can you tell me where
I might find platform 93/4?

272
00:32:06.395 --> 00:32:08.932
Think you're being funny, do you?

273
00:32:09.142 --> 00:32:12.479
It's the same every year,
packed with Muggles.

274
00:32:12.938 --> 00:32:16.305
- Muggles?
- Platform 93/4, this way.

275
00:32:21.979 --> 00:32:25.146
All right, Percy, you first.

276
00:32:35.096 --> 00:32:36.305
Fred, you next.

277
00:32:36.515 --> 00:32:40.221
- He's not Fred, I am.
- You call yourself our mother?

278
00:32:40.431 --> 00:32:42.389
I'm sorry, George.

279
00:32:46.515 --> 00:32:48.932
I'm only joking. I am Fred.

280
00:32:54.727 --> 00:32:57.304
Excuse me.

281
00:32:58.393 --> 00:33:01.180
Could you tell me how to?

282
00:33:01.390 --> 00:33:04.936
How to get onto the platform?
Not to worry, dear.

283
00:33:05.146 --> 00:33:07.604
It's Ron's first time
to Hogwarts as well.

284
00:33:07.813 --> 00:33:13.727
All you do is walk straight at the wall
between platforms 9 and 10.

285
00:33:13.937 --> 00:33:17.394
- Best to run if you're nervous.
- Good luck.

286
00:34:14.936 --> 00:34:19.182
Excuse me. Do you mind?
Everywhere else is full.

287
00:34:19.392 --> 00:34:21.600
Not at all.

288
00:34:24.686 --> 00:34:27.104
I'm Ron, by the way.
Ron Weasley.

289
00:34:27.354 --> 00:34:29.971
I'm Harry. Harry Potter.

290
00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:33.388
So it's true!

291
00:34:33.598 --> 00:34:36.395
I mean, do you really have the?

292
00:34:36.974 --> 00:34:39.851
- The what?
- The scar?

293
00:34:43.018 --> 00:34:45.226
Wicked!

294
00:34:47.683 --> 00:34:52.848
- Anything off the trolley, dears?
- No, thanks. I'm all set.

295
00:34:56.894 --> 00:34:59.182
We'll take the lot.

296
00:35:09.891 --> 00:35:14.686
- Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans?
- They mean every flavor.

297
00:35:15.096 --> 00:35:18.473
There's chocolate
and peppermint and also...

298
00:35:18.682 --> 00:35:22.519
spinach, liver and tripe.

299
00:35:22.728 --> 00:35:26.894
George sweared he got
a booger-flavored one once.

300
00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:36.894
- Are they real frogs?
- It's a spell. You want the cards.

301
00:35:37.104 --> 00:35:42.559
Each pack's got a famous witch
or wizard. I've got about 500 meself.

302
00:35:44.057 --> 00:35:46.355
Watch it!

303
00:35:48.353 --> 00:35:52.139
That's rotten luck. They've only
got one good jump in them.

304
00:35:55.016 --> 00:35:58.932
- I've got Dumbledore!
- I got about six of him.

305
00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:02.229
Hey, he's gone!

306
00:36:02.429 --> 00:36:05.895
You can't expect him to
hang around all day, can you?

307
00:36:06.515 --> 00:36:09.641
This is Scabbers.
Pathetic, isn't he?

308
00:36:09.851 --> 00:36:11.020
A little.

309
00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:14.556
Fred gave me a spell
to turn him yellow. Want to see?

310
00:36:14.766 --> 00:36:16.804
Yeah.

311
00:36:23.557 --> 00:36:25.186
Has anyone seen a toad?

312
00:36:25.555 --> 00:36:28.223
- A boy named Neville's lost one.
- No.

313
00:36:28.812 --> 00:36:33.138
Oh, are you doing magic?
Let's see, then.

314
00:36:34.187 --> 00:36:38.512
<i>Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow</i>

315
00:36:38.762 --> 00:36:41.849
<i>Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow</i>

316
00:36:44.596 --> 00:36:50.221
Are you sure that's a real spell?
Well, it's not very good, is it?

317
00:36:50.431 --> 00:36:53.687
I've only tried
a few simple ones myself...

318
00:36:53.887 --> 00:36:56.514
but they've all worked for me.

319
00:37:00.141 --> 00:37:02.179
For example:

320
00:37:02.558 --> 00:37:05.346
<i>Oculus Reparo.</i>

321
00:37:07.434 --> 00:37:10.061
That's better, isn't it?

322
00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:15.146
Holy cricket, you're Harry Potter!

323
00:37:15.346 --> 00:37:18.932
I'm Hermione Granger.
And you are?

324
00:37:19.641 --> 00:37:22.848
- I'm Ron Weasley.
- Pleasure.

325
00:37:23.058 --> 00:37:28.143
You two better change into robes.
I expect we'll be arriving soon.

326
00:37:32.269 --> 00:37:35.725
You've got dirt on your nose.
Did you know?

327
00:37:35.935 --> 00:37:37.893
Just there.

328
00:37:50.221 --> 00:37:54.017
Right, then.
First years, this way, please!

329
00:37:54.227 --> 00:37:59.431
Come on, first years, don't be shy.
Come on now, hurry up.

330
00:38:06.434 --> 00:38:09.392
- Hello, Harry.
- Hi, Hagrid.

331
00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:14.806
Right, then. This way to the boats.
Come on now, follow me.

332
00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:02.269
Wicked.

333
00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:32.638
Welcome to Hogwarts.

334
00:39:32.848 --> 00:39:36.854
Shortly, you'll pass through
these doors and join your classmates.

335
00:39:37.054 --> 00:39:42.099
But before you take your seats,
you must be sorted into your houses.

336
00:39:42.309 --> 00:39:45.435
They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff...

337
00:39:45.645 --> 00:39:50.101
Ravenclaw and Slytherin.

338
00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:55.555
While you're here, your house
will be like your family.

339
00:39:56.185 --> 00:39:59.681
Your triumphs will earn you points.

340
00:39:59.891 --> 00:40:04.017
Any rule-breaking
and you will lose points.

341
00:40:04.227 --> 00:40:09.521
At the end of the year, the house
with the most points wins the house cup.

342
00:40:09.771 --> 00:40:11.060
Trevor!

343
00:40:19.971 --> 00:40:21.599
Sorry.

344
00:40:21.809 --> 00:40:25.765
The Sorting Ceremony
will begin momentarily.

345
00:40:27.104 --> 00:40:30.430
It's true then,
what they're saying on the train.

346
00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:33.477
Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.

347
00:40:33.687 --> 00:40:35.096
Harry Potter?

348
00:40:35.725 --> 00:40:38.392
This is Crabbe and Goyle.

349
00:40:38.602 --> 00:40:40.890
And I'm Malfoy.

350
00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:43.557
Draco Malfoy.

351
00:40:45.515 --> 00:40:49.102
Think my name's funny, do you?
I've no need to ask yours.

352
00:40:49.311 --> 00:40:55.096
Red hair and a hand-me-down robe?
You must be a Weasley.

353
00:40:56.015 --> 00:41:00.061
You'll find out some wizarding families
are better than others.

354
00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:04.057
You don't want to go making friends
with the wrong sort.

355
00:41:04.266 --> 00:41:06.434
I can help you there.

356
00:41:08.642 --> 00:41:12.478
I think I can tell the wrong sort
for myself, thanks.

357
00:41:18.103 --> 00:41:20.310
We're ready for you now.
Follow me.

358
00:41:38.892 --> 00:41:43.387
The ceiling isn't real. It's bewitched
to look like the night sky.

359
00:41:43.727 --> 00:41:46.604
I read about it
in <i>Hogwarts, A History.</i>

360
00:41:59.851 --> 00:42:02.688
Will you wait along here, please?

361
00:42:04.097 --> 00:42:06.894
Now, before we begin...

362
00:42:07.104 --> 00:42:10.350
Professor Dumbledore would like
to say a few words.

363
00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:15.345
I have a few start-of-term notices
I wish to announce.

364
00:42:15.725 --> 00:42:17.853
The first years, please note...

365
00:42:18.143 --> 00:42:24.147
that the Dark Forest is
strictly forbidden to all students.

366
00:42:24.396 --> 00:42:29.891
Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch,
has asked me to remind you...

367
00:42:30.101 --> 00:42:34.726
that the third-floor corridor
is out of bounds...

368
00:42:35.016 --> 00:42:39.221
to everyone who does not wish
to die a most painful death.

369
00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:42.558
Thank you.

370
00:42:44.306 --> 00:42:48.392
When I call your name,
you will come forth.

371
00:42:48.602 --> 00:42:52.228
I shall place the Sorting Hat
on your head...

372
00:42:52.438 --> 00:42:55.645
and you will be sorted
into your houses.

373
00:42:55.855 --> 00:42:58.472
Hermione Granger.

374
00:43:00.730 --> 00:43:03.347
Oh, no. Okay, relax.

375
00:43:03.727 --> 00:43:07.104
Mental, that one, I'm telling you.

376
00:43:12.558 --> 00:43:16.434
Right, then. Right.

377
00:43:16.644 --> 00:43:20.220
Okay. Gryffindor!

378
00:43:29.022 --> 00:43:31.809
Draco Malfoy.

379
00:43:36.354 --> 00:43:38.562
Slytherin!

380
00:43:39.521 --> 00:43:42.438
Every wizard who went bad
was in Slytherin.

381
00:43:42.638 --> 00:43:45.185
Susan Bones.

382
00:43:53.727 --> 00:43:55.855
Harry, what is it?

383
00:43:56.104 --> 00:43:58.812
Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine.

384
00:43:59.062 --> 00:44:00.480
Let's see...

385
00:44:00.730 --> 00:44:05.056
I know! Hufflepuff!

386
00:44:06.804 --> 00:44:09.221
Ronald Weasley.

387
00:44:23.057 --> 00:44:28.062
Another Weasley!
I know just what to do with you.

388
00:44:28.772 --> 00:44:31.059
Gryffindor!

389
00:44:37.263 --> 00:44:39.771
Harry Potter.

390
00:44:57.813 --> 00:45:00.810
Difficult, very difficult.

391
00:45:01.019 --> 00:45:04.976
Plenty of courage, I see.
Not a bad mind, either.

392
00:45:05.185 --> 00:45:07.473
There's talent, oh, yes.

393
00:45:07.683 --> 00:45:11.519
And a thirst to prove yourself.

394
00:45:11.729 --> 00:45:13.897
But where to put you?

395
00:45:14.476 --> 00:45:16.974
Not Slytherin, not Slytherin!

396
00:45:17.223 --> 00:45:20.850
Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure?

397
00:45:21.059 --> 00:45:25.935
You could be great, you know.
It's all here, in your head.

398
00:45:26.144 --> 00:45:31.479
And Slytherin will help you on the way
to greatness, no doubt about that.

399
00:45:31.809 --> 00:45:36.434
No? Well, if you're sure.

400
00:45:36.644 --> 00:45:38.392
Better be...

401
00:45:38.602 --> 00:45:40.560
Gryffindor!

402
00:46:06.054 --> 00:46:08.852
Your attention, please.

403
00:46:10.890 --> 00:46:13.597
Let the feast begin.

404
00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:32.058
I'm half and half.

405
00:46:32.268 --> 00:46:35.515
Me dad's a Muggle. Mum's a witch.

406
00:46:35.725 --> 00:46:39.221
Bit of a nasty shock for him
when he found out.

407
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:44.016
Percy, who's that teacher
talking to Professor Quirrell?

408
00:46:44.346 --> 00:46:47.473
Professor Snape,
head of Slytherin house.

409
00:46:47.683 --> 00:46:49.601
- What's he teach?
- Potions.

410
00:46:49.811 --> 00:46:55.395
But he fancies the Dark Arts.
He's been after Quirrell's job for years.

411
00:46:59.890 --> 00:47:02.228
Hello! How are you?

412
00:47:02.478 --> 00:47:05.855
Welcome to Gryffindor.

413
00:47:15.934 --> 00:47:18.432
It's the Bloody Baron!

414
00:47:23.057 --> 00:47:25.855
Hello, Sir Nicholas.
Have a nice summer?

415
00:47:26.054 --> 00:47:31.479
Dismal. Once again, my request to join
the Headless Hunt has been denied.

416
00:47:34.516 --> 00:47:37.433
I know you.
You're Nearly Headless Nick.

417
00:47:37.643 --> 00:47:40.390
I prefer Sir Nicholas,
if you don't mind.

418
00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:44.096
"Nearly" headless?
How can you be nearly headless?

419
00:47:44.436 --> 00:47:46.394
Like this.

420
00:47:56.394 --> 00:48:00.230
Gryffindors, follow me, please.
Keep up. Thank you.

421
00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:04.766
Ravenclaw, follow me. This way.

422
00:48:05.015 --> 00:48:08.352
This is the most direct path
to the dormitories.

423
00:48:08.562 --> 00:48:12.728
Keep an eye on the staircases.
They like to change.

424
00:48:21.848 --> 00:48:27.643
Keep up, please, and follow me.
Quickly now, come on. Come on.

425
00:48:27.852 --> 00:48:30.520
That picture's moving.

426
00:48:30.730 --> 00:48:34.226
- Look at that one.
- I think she fancies you.

427
00:48:35.974 --> 00:48:38.312
- Look!
- Who's that girl?

428
00:48:38.522 --> 00:48:41.059
Welcome to Hogwarts.

429
00:48:57.063 --> 00:48:58.642
Password?

430
00:48:59.101 --> 00:49:01.888
Caput Draconis.

431
00:49:08.642 --> 00:49:13.517
Follow me, everyone. Keep up.
Quickly, come on.

432
00:49:16.224 --> 00:49:18.642
Gather around here.

433
00:49:20.350 --> 00:49:23.647
Welcome to the Gryffindor common room.

434
00:49:23.846 --> 00:49:28.262
Boys' dormitory is upstairs to the left.
Girls, the same on your right.

435
00:49:28.472 --> 00:49:31.599
Your belongings have
already been brought up.

436
00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:41.349
Made it!

437
00:50:41.559 --> 00:50:45.974
Can you imagine the look on old
McGonagall's face if we were late?

438
00:50:49.221 --> 00:50:54.186
- That was bloody brilliant!
- Thank you for that assessment.

439
00:50:54.396 --> 00:50:58.681
It'd be better if I transfigured
Mr. Potter and you into a watch.

440
00:50:58.891 --> 00:51:02.098
- Then one of you might be on time.
- We got lost.

441
00:51:02.308 --> 00:51:08.062
Then perhaps a map? I trust you
don't need one to find your seats.

442
00:51:16.224 --> 00:51:21.888
There will be no foolish wand-waving
or silly incantations in this class.

443
00:51:22.098 --> 00:51:25.724
As such, I don't expect
many of you to appreciate...

444
00:51:25.974 --> 00:51:29.680
the subtle science and exact art
that is potion-making.

445
00:51:29.890 --> 00:51:32.977
However, for those select few...

446
00:51:33.896 --> 00:51:37.223
who possess the predisposition...

447
00:51:40.889 --> 00:51:44.186
I can teach you
how to bewitch the mind...

448
00:51:44.396 --> 00:51:47.313
and ensnare the senses.

449
00:51:47.513 --> 00:51:50.060
I can tell you how to bottle fame...

450
00:51:50.270 --> 00:51:56.184
brew glory and even
put a stopper in death.

451
00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:05.105
Then again, maybe some of you have
come to Hogwarts with abilities...

452
00:52:05.305 --> 00:52:11.269
so formidable that
you feel confident enough...

453
00:52:11.479 --> 00:52:14.436
to not pay attention.

454
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:22.977
Mr. Potter.

455
00:52:24.186 --> 00:52:28.012
Our new celebrity.

456
00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:35.974
What would I get if I added root
of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?

457
00:52:39.221 --> 00:52:41.638
You don't know? Let's try again.

458
00:52:41.848 --> 00:52:46.474
Where would you look
if I asked you to find a bezoar?

459
00:52:47.762 --> 00:52:49.141
I don't know, sir.

460
00:52:49.431 --> 00:52:53.267
What is the difference
between monkshood and wolfsbane?

461
00:52:55.804 --> 00:52:58.062
I don't know, sir.

462
00:52:59.141 --> 00:53:00.430
Pity.

463
00:53:02.138 --> 00:53:06.354
Clearly, fame isn't everything...

464
00:53:07.103 --> 00:53:09.890
is it, Mr. Potter?

465
00:53:12.058 --> 00:53:17.682
<i>Eye of rabbit, harp string hum</i>
<i>Turn this water into rum</i>

466
00:53:18.891 --> 00:53:20.430
<i>Eye of rabbit...</i>

467
00:53:20.769 --> 00:53:23.437
What's Seamus trying to do
to the water?

468
00:53:23.686 --> 00:53:28.392
Turn it to rum. Actually managed
a weak tea yesterday, before...

469
00:53:35.105 --> 00:53:37.013
Mail's here.

470
00:54:09.271 --> 00:54:12.228
Can I borrow this? Thanks.

471
00:54:16.144 --> 00:54:18.352
Look, Neville's got a Remembrall.

472
00:54:18.561 --> 00:54:24.056
I've read about those. The smoke turns
red when you've forgotten something.

473
00:54:24.436 --> 00:54:27.762
The problem is, I can't remember
what I've forgotten.

474
00:54:28.062 --> 00:54:31.478
Somebody broke into Gringotts. Listen.

475
00:54:31.688 --> 00:54:35.355
"Believed to be the work
of Dark wizards or witches...

476
00:54:35.604 --> 00:54:41.309
Gringotts goblins acknowledge
the breach but insist nothing was taken.

477
00:54:41.518 --> 00:54:47.223
The vault in question, number 713,
had been emptied earlier that same day."

478
00:54:47.432 --> 00:54:51.688
That's odd. That's the vault
Hagrid and I went to.

479
00:55:00.599 --> 00:55:04.346
- Good afternoon, class.
- Good afternoon, Madam Hooch.

480
00:55:04.555 --> 00:55:07.353
Good afternoon, Amanda.
Good afternoon.

481
00:55:08.641 --> 00:55:11.099
Welcome to your first flying lesson.

482
00:55:11.309 --> 00:55:15.225
What are you waiting for?
Step up to your broomstick.

483
00:55:15.434 --> 00:55:21.019
Come on now, hurry up. Stick your hand
over the broom and say, "Up."

484
00:55:21.229 --> 00:55:23.187
Up!

485
00:55:23.436 --> 00:55:24.395
Up.

486
00:55:25.894 --> 00:55:27.722
Up.

487
00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:31.019
Up. Up!

488
00:55:31.229 --> 00:55:33.227
With feeling.

489
00:55:41.888 --> 00:55:44.016
Shut up, Harry.

490
00:55:44.266 --> 00:55:48.891
Now, once you've got hold of
your broom, I want you to mount it.

491
00:55:49.101 --> 00:55:53.097
Grip it tight. You don't wanna be
sliding off the end.

492
00:55:53.476 --> 00:55:58.431
When I blow my whistle, I want you
to kick off from the ground, hard.

493
00:55:58.641 --> 00:56:02.477
Keep your broom steady,
hover for a moment...

494
00:56:02.687 --> 00:56:06.973
then lean forward slightly
and touch back down.

495
00:56:07.223 --> 00:56:10.349
On my whistle. Three, two...

496
00:56:12.767 --> 00:56:14.146
Mr. Longbottom.

497
00:56:18.771 --> 00:56:21.638
- Mr. Longbottom!
- Down, down!

498
00:56:21.848 --> 00:56:23.097
Neville!

499
00:56:26.813 --> 00:56:29.470
Come back down this instant!

500
00:56:58.431 --> 00:57:00.809
Everyone out of the way!

501
00:57:06.353 --> 00:57:08.521
Is he all right?

502
00:57:08.891 --> 00:57:14.555
Oh, dear, it's a broken wrist.
Poor boy. Come on now, up you get.

503
00:57:15.854 --> 00:57:20.519
Keep your feet on the ground
while I take him to the hospital wing.

504
00:57:20.729 --> 00:57:24.395
Understand? If I see
a single broom in the air...

505
00:57:24.605 --> 00:57:29.850
the one riding it will be expelled
before they can say Quidditch.

506
00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:31.978
Did you see his face?

507
00:57:32.188 --> 00:57:36.014
If he had squeezed this, he'd have
remembered to fall on his arse.

508
00:57:36.224 --> 00:57:38.721
Give it here, Malfoy.

509
00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:43.266
No. I'll leave it somewhere
for Longbottom to find.

510
00:57:47.432 --> 00:57:49.890
How about on the roof?

511
00:57:51.059 --> 00:57:54.895
What's the matter, Potter?
Bit beyond your reach?

512
00:57:57.392 --> 00:58:01.228
Harry, no way!
You heard what Madam Hooch said.

513
00:58:01.438 --> 00:58:04.345
Besides, you don't know how to fly.

514
00:58:04.645 --> 00:58:06.563
What an idiot.

515
00:58:09.890 --> 00:58:13.436
Give it here or I'll
knock you off your broom!

516
00:58:13.646 --> 00:58:15.764
Is that so?

517
00:58:18.891 --> 00:58:21.189
Have it your way, then.

518
00:58:53.896 --> 00:58:57.512
- Nice going, Harry.
- That was wicked, Harry!

519
00:58:57.722 --> 00:58:59.770
Harry Potter!

520
00:59:00.729 --> 00:59:02.727
Follow me.

521
00:59:14.395 --> 00:59:16.643
You wait here.

522
00:59:18.391 --> 00:59:23.686
Professor Quirrell, excuse me.
Could I borrow Wood for a moment?

523
00:59:23.896 --> 00:59:25.724
Yes, of course.

524
00:59:31.388 --> 00:59:37.142
Potter, this is Oliver Wood.
Wood, I have found you a Seeker.

525
00:59:39.220 --> 00:59:42.727
Have you heard? Harry Potter's
the new Gryffindor Seeker.

526
00:59:42.977 --> 00:59:45.184
I always knew he'd do well.

527
00:59:45.644 --> 00:59:49.680
Seeker? But first years
never make the house teams.

528
00:59:49.890 --> 00:59:54.395
- You must be the youngest player in...
- A century, McGonagall says.

529
00:59:54.605 --> 00:59:57.222
Well done, Harry.
Wood's just told us.

530
00:59:57.432 --> 00:59:59.930
Fred and George are on the team.
Beaters.

531
01:00:00.139 --> 01:00:03.846
Our job is to make sure you
don't get bloodied up too bad.

532
01:00:04.056 --> 01:00:06.723
Can't make any promises.
Rough game, Quidditch.

533
01:00:06.933 --> 01:00:10.889
But no one's died in years.
Someone vanishes occasionally.

534
01:00:11.098 --> 01:00:13.846
But they'll turn up in a month or two.

535
01:00:14.095 --> 01:00:19.730
Go on. Quidditch is great. Best game
there is, and you'll be great too.

536
01:00:19.930 --> 01:00:23.146
I've never played.
What if I make a fool of myself?

537
01:00:23.556 --> 01:00:28.351
You won't make a fool of yourself.
It's in your blood.

538
01:00:36.893 --> 01:00:40.729
You never told me your father
was a Seeker too.

539
01:00:41.558 --> 01:00:43.766
I didn't know.

540
01:00:48.271 --> 01:00:52.847
I'm telling you, it's spooky.
She knows more about you than you do.

541
01:00:53.056 --> 01:00:55.354
Who doesn't?

542
01:00:56.263 --> 01:00:58.391
What's happening?

543
01:00:58.601 --> 01:01:02.807
The staircases change, remember?

544
01:01:08.271 --> 01:01:12.727
- Let's go this way.
- Before the staircase moves again.

545
01:01:20.349 --> 01:01:23.766
Does anybody feel like
we shouldn't be here?

546
01:01:24.016 --> 01:01:26.143
We're not supposed to be here.

547
01:01:26.353 --> 01:01:30.269
This is the third floor.
It's forbidden.

548
01:01:31.438 --> 01:01:33.016
Let's go.

549
01:01:35.224 --> 01:01:38.101
- It's Filch's cat!
- Run!

550
01:01:41.888 --> 01:01:45.224
Quick, let's hide through that door!

551
01:01:50.349 --> 01:01:52.387
- It's locked!
- We're done for!

552
01:01:52.597 --> 01:01:54.765
Move over!

553
01:01:55.724 --> 01:01:57.852
<i>Alohomora.</i>

554
01:01:58.721 --> 01:02:00.639
Get in.

555
01:02:01.888 --> 01:02:02.977
<i>Alohomora?</i>

556
01:02:03.186 --> 01:02:05.724
<i>Standard Book of Spells,</i>
chapter seven.

557
01:02:05.934 --> 01:02:09.310
Anyone here, my sweet?

558
01:02:15.554 --> 01:02:16.563
Come on.

559
01:02:17.432 --> 01:02:19.890
- Filch is gone.
- He thinks this door's locked.

560
01:02:20.139 --> 01:02:23.766
- It was locked.
- And for good reason.

561
01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:54.895
What are they doing, keeping a thing
like that locked up in a school?

562
01:02:55.104 --> 01:02:58.771
Didn't you see what
it was standing on?

563
01:02:58.970 --> 01:03:03.146
I wasn't looking at its feet!
I was preoccupied with its heads.

564
01:03:03.346 --> 01:03:06.223
Or maybe you didn't notice.
There were three!

565
01:03:06.433 --> 01:03:10.099
It was standing on a trap door.
It wasn't there by accident.

566
01:03:10.309 --> 01:03:13.846
- It's guarding something.
- Guarding something?

567
01:03:14.265 --> 01:03:18.021
That's right. Now, if you two don't mind,
I'm going to bed...

568
01:03:18.221 --> 01:03:21.848
before you come up with another idea
to get us killed.

569
01:03:22.057 --> 01:03:25.184
Or worse, expelled.

570
01:03:28.431 --> 01:03:32.687
She needs to sort out her priorities.

571
01:03:37.312 --> 01:03:41.518
Quidditch is easy to understand.
Each team has seven players.

572
01:03:41.728 --> 01:03:47.432
Three Chasers, two Beaters,
one Keeper and a Seeker. That's you.

573
01:03:52.517 --> 01:03:56.643
There are three kinds of balls.
This one's called the Quaffle.

574
01:03:56.853 --> 01:04:02.807
The Chasers handle the Quaffle and try
to put it through one of those hoops.

575
01:04:03.016 --> 01:04:07.392
The Keeper, that's me,
defends the hoops. With me so far?

576
01:04:07.602 --> 01:04:12.057
I think so. What are those?

577
01:04:14.355 --> 01:04:16.513
You better take this.

578
01:04:26.563 --> 01:04:29.350
Careful now, it's coming back.

579
01:04:35.933 --> 01:04:39.560
Not bad, Potter.
You'd make a fair Beater.

580
01:04:56.183 --> 01:04:58.471
What was that?

581
01:04:59.230 --> 01:05:02.976
Bludger. Nasty little buggers.

582
01:05:03.186 --> 01:05:06.683
But you are a Seeker.

583
01:05:10.269 --> 01:05:14.854
The only thing I want you
to worry about is this.

584
01:05:15.104 --> 01:05:17.602
The Golden Snitch.

585
01:05:17.811 --> 01:05:20.808
- I like this ball.
- You like it now.

586
01:05:21.018 --> 01:05:25.014
Just wait. It's wicked fast
and damn near impossible to see.

587
01:05:25.224 --> 01:05:27.182
What do I do with it?

588
01:05:27.392 --> 01:05:30.639
You catch it.
Before the other team's Seeker.

589
01:05:30.888 --> 01:05:33.346
You catch this, the game's over.

590
01:05:33.556 --> 01:05:37.522
You catch this, Potter,
and we win.

591
01:05:46.563 --> 01:05:51.887
One of a wizard's most rudimentary
skills is levitation...

592
01:05:52.097 --> 01:05:56.063
or the ability to make objects fly.

593
01:05:56.263 --> 01:05:58.681
Do you have your feathers? Good.

594
01:05:58.930 --> 01:06:04.055
Now, don't forget the nice wrist
movement we've been practicing.

595
01:06:04.265 --> 01:06:07.602
The swish and flick. Everyone.

596
01:06:08.141 --> 01:06:13.765
The swish and flick. Good.
Oh, and enunciate.

597
01:06:14.475 --> 01:06:18.770
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>
Off you go, then.

598
01:06:19.809 --> 01:06:22.307
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>

599
01:06:22.557 --> 01:06:24.894
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>

600
01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:32.976
No, stop, stop, stop! You're going
to take someone's eye out.

601
01:06:33.226 --> 01:06:39.180
Besides, you're saying it wrong.
It's <i>Leviosa,</i> not <i>Leviosar.</i>

602
01:06:39.769 --> 01:06:43.975
You do it then, if you're so clever.
Go on, go on.

603
01:06:45.224 --> 01:06:48.311
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>

604
01:06:55.813 --> 01:07:01.438
Well done! See here, everyone,
Miss Granger's done it!

605
01:07:01.638 --> 01:07:03.306
Splendid!

606
01:07:04.894 --> 01:07:07.102
Well done, dear.

607
01:07:11.308 --> 01:07:15.394
I think we're going to need
another feather over here.

608
01:07:21.887 --> 01:07:26.143
"It's <i>Leviosa,</i> not <i>Leviosar."</i>

609
01:07:26.393 --> 01:07:31.727
She's a nightmare, honestly!
No wonder she hasn't got any friends.

610
01:07:32.397 --> 01:07:34.934
I think she heard you.

611
01:08:03.556 --> 01:08:05.643
Where's Hermione?

612
01:08:05.853 --> 01:08:08.980
Parvati said she wouldn't
come out of the bathroom.

613
01:08:09.180 --> 01:08:13.266
She said that she'd been in there
all afternoon, crying.

614
01:08:17.681 --> 01:08:21.348
Troll in the dungeon!

615
01:08:21.598 --> 01:08:24.934
Troll in the dungeon!

616
01:08:27.721 --> 01:08:30.059
Thought you ought to know.

617
01:08:36.932 --> 01:08:39.769
Silence!

618
01:08:41.348 --> 01:08:45.394
Everyone will please not panic!

619
01:08:46.063 --> 01:08:47.641
Now...

620
01:08:47.851 --> 01:08:52.397
prefects will lead their house
back to the dormitories.

621
01:08:53.096 --> 01:08:57.891
Teachers will follow me
to the dungeons.

622
01:09:08.930 --> 01:09:12.097
Gryffindors, keep up, please,
and stay alert.

623
01:09:12.307 --> 01:09:14.055
How could a troll get in?

624
01:09:14.265 --> 01:09:19.430
Not on its own. Trolls are really stupid.
Probably people playing jokes.

625
01:09:19.639 --> 01:09:23.645
- What?
- Hermione! She doesn't know.

626
01:09:35.723 --> 01:09:38.980
I think the troll's left the dungeon.

627
01:09:42.846 --> 01:09:45.014
It's going into the girls' bathroom.

628
01:10:16.013 --> 01:10:18.391
Hermione, move!

629
01:10:21.767 --> 01:10:25.893
Help! Help!

630
01:10:27.891 --> 01:10:29.979
Hey, pea brain!

631
01:10:42.397 --> 01:10:44.265
Help!

632
01:11:05.394 --> 01:11:07.771
Do something!

633
01:11:09.180 --> 01:11:13.146
- What?
- Anything!

634
01:11:13.765 --> 01:11:16.183
- Hurry up!
- Swish and flick.

635
01:11:16.393 --> 01:11:18.720
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>

636
01:11:29.639 --> 01:11:31.637
Cool.

637
01:11:56.013 --> 01:11:58.850
Is it dead?

638
01:11:59.060 --> 01:12:02.976
I don't think so. Just knocked out.

639
01:12:09.230 --> 01:12:11.557
Troll boogers.

640
01:12:14.055 --> 01:12:17.601
Oh, my goodness!
Explain yourselves, both of you!

641
01:12:17.811 --> 01:12:22.436
- Well, what it is...
- It's my fault, Professor McGonagall.

642
01:12:24.604 --> 01:12:25.813
Miss Granger?

643
01:12:26.682 --> 01:12:31.767
I went looking for the troll.
I thought I could handle it.

644
01:12:31.977 --> 01:12:33.855
But I was wrong.

645
01:12:34.055 --> 01:12:39.100
If Harry and Ron hadn't come
and found me, I'd probably be dead.

646
01:12:40.099 --> 01:12:44.514
Be that as it may, it was
an extremely foolish thing to do.

647
01:12:44.724 --> 01:12:50.388
I expected more rational behavior
and am very disappointed in you.

648
01:12:50.598 --> 01:12:53.595
Five points will be taken
from Gryffindor...

649
01:12:53.805 --> 01:12:57.391
for your serious lack of judgment.

650
01:12:57.851 --> 01:12:59.849
As for you two gentlemen...

651
01:13:00.059 --> 01:13:03.475
I just hope you realize
how fortunate you are.

652
01:13:03.685 --> 01:13:07.102
Not many first-year students
could take on a troll...

653
01:13:07.312 --> 01:13:09.929
and live to tell the tale.

654
01:13:10.179 --> 01:13:12.596
Five points...

655
01:13:13.975 --> 01:13:17.102
will be awarded to each of you...

656
01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:21.767
for sheer dumb luck.

657
01:13:27.351 --> 01:13:31.098
Perhaps you ought to go.
It might wake up.

658
01:13:38.930 --> 01:13:41.687
Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on.

659
01:13:41.887 --> 01:13:45.104
Ron's right.
You'll need your strength today.

660
01:13:45.313 --> 01:13:47.521
I'm not hungry.

661
01:13:48.101 --> 01:13:53.725
Good luck today, Potter.
You've proven yourself against a troll.

662
01:13:53.935 --> 01:13:57.102
A game of Quidditch
should be easy work.

663
01:13:57.311 --> 01:14:00.438
Even if it is against Slytherin.

664
01:14:08.101 --> 01:14:11.517
- That explains the blood.
- Blood?

665
01:14:11.937 --> 01:14:16.063
Last night, I'm guessing Snape let
the troll in as a diversion...

666
01:14:16.262 --> 01:14:18.980
so he could get past that dog.

667
01:14:19.140 --> 01:14:21.897
But he got bit,
that's why he's limping.

668
01:14:22.147 --> 01:14:24.354
But why would anyone go near that dog?

669
01:14:25.014 --> 01:14:28.270
At Gringotts, Hagrid took
something out of the vault.

670
01:14:28.470 --> 01:14:31.727
Said it was Hogwarts business,
very secret.

671
01:14:31.937 --> 01:14:33.056
You're saying...

672
01:14:33.265 --> 01:14:37.771
That's what the dog's guarding.
That's what Snape wants.

673
01:14:50.888 --> 01:14:54.854
- Bit early for mail, isn't it?
- But I never get mail.

674
01:14:55.393 --> 01:14:56.932
Let's open it.

675
01:15:07.102 --> 01:15:08.350
It's a broomstick.

676
01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:13.265
That's not just a broomstick,
it's a Nimbus 2000!

677
01:15:14.724 --> 01:15:16.762
But who?

678
01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:40.888
- Scared, Harry?
- A little.

679
01:15:41.098 --> 01:15:44.764
It's all right. I felt the same way
before my first game.

680
01:15:44.974 --> 01:15:48.480
- What happened?
- I don't really remember.

681
01:15:48.770 --> 01:15:51.477
I took a Bludger to the head
two minutes in.

682
01:15:51.637 --> 01:15:54.474
Woke up in hospital a week later.

683
01:16:16.642 --> 01:16:20.019
Welcome to Hogwarts' first
Quidditch game of the season.

684
01:16:20.228 --> 01:16:24.934
Today's game,
Slytherin versus Gryffindor!

685
01:16:55.183 --> 01:16:57.641
The players take their positions...

686
01:16:57.851 --> 01:17:01.637
as Madam Hooch steps onto
the field to begin the game!

687
01:17:01.847 --> 01:17:05.183
Now, I want a nice, clean game...

688
01:17:05.813 --> 01:17:08.220
from all of you!

689
01:17:13.345 --> 01:17:16.262
The Bludgers are up,
followed by the Golden Snitch.

690
01:17:16.472 --> 01:17:19.179
Remember, the Snitch
is worth 150 points.

691
01:17:19.389 --> 01:17:23.185
The Seeker who catches the Snitch
ends the game.

692
01:17:29.309 --> 01:17:33.435
The Quaffle is released
and the game begins!

693
01:17:52.096 --> 01:17:56.892
Angelina Johnson scores!
Ten points for Gryffindor!

694
01:18:02.056 --> 01:18:03.355
Well done!

695
01:18:07.721 --> 01:18:13.435
Slytherin takes the Quaffle.
Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.

696
01:18:45.433 --> 01:18:48.220
Another 10 points to Gryffindor!

697
01:19:02.016 --> 01:19:03.895
Give me that!

698
01:19:35.313 --> 01:19:37.930
Take that side!

699
01:20:27.351 --> 01:20:30.598
What's going on
with Harry's broomstick?

700
01:20:39.519 --> 01:20:41.727
It's Snape.
He's jinxing the broom!

701
01:20:41.936 --> 01:20:46.312
- Jinxing the broom? What do we do?
- Leave it to me.

702
01:21:08.060 --> 01:21:09.599
Come on, Hermione!

703
01:21:23.685 --> 01:21:27.431
<i>Lacarnum Inflamarae.</i>

704
01:21:34.514 --> 01:21:37.561
Fire! You're on fire!

705
01:21:55.393 --> 01:21:57.561
Go, go, go, go!

706
01:22:49.519 --> 01:22:51.846
Looks like he's gonna be sick.

707
01:22:52.935 --> 01:22:54.394
He's got the Snitch!

708
01:22:54.604 --> 01:22:58.680
Harry Potter receives 150 points
for catching the Snitch!

709
01:22:58.889 --> 01:23:00.558
Gryffindor wins!

710
01:23:44.104 --> 01:23:48.350
Nonsense! Why would Snape
put a curse on Harry's broom?

711
01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:52.476
Who knows? Why was he trying
to get past that three-headed dog?

712
01:23:52.685 --> 01:23:55.103
- Who told you about Fluffy?
- Fluffy?

713
01:23:55.313 --> 01:23:58.979
- That thing has a name?
- Of course he has a name. He's mine.

714
01:23:59.179 --> 01:24:04.474
I bought him off an Irishman.
I lent him to Dumbledore to guard...

715
01:24:04.683 --> 01:24:09.269
Shouldn't have said that.
No more questions! That's top-secret.

716
01:24:09.848 --> 01:24:13.854
But whatever Fluffy's guarding,
Snape's trying to steal it.

717
01:24:14.054 --> 01:24:17.521
Codswallop. Professor Snape
is a Hogwarts teacher.

718
01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:23.105
Teacher or not, I know a spell when
I see one. I've read all about them.

719
01:24:23.305 --> 01:24:26.891
You've got to keep eye contact,
and Snape wasn't blinking.

720
01:24:27.101 --> 01:24:29.349
Exactly.

721
01:24:30.018 --> 01:24:32.765
Now, you listen to me,
all three of you.

722
01:24:32.975 --> 01:24:37.640
You're meddling in things that ought
not to be meddled in. It's dangerous.

723
01:24:37.850 --> 01:24:42.935
What that dog is guarding is
between Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.

724
01:24:43.145 --> 01:24:44.554
Nicholas Flamel?

725
01:24:45.563 --> 01:24:50.268
I shouldn't have said that.
I should not have said that.

726
01:24:50.478 --> 01:24:54.554
Nicholas Flamel.
Who's Nicholas Flamel?

727
01:24:54.763 --> 01:24:56.771
I don't know.

728
01:25:15.602 --> 01:25:18.430
<i>Merry Christmas</i>
<i>Merry Christmas</i>

729
01:25:18.679 --> 01:25:21.477
<i>Ring the Hogwart bell</i>

730
01:25:21.686 --> 01:25:24.474
<i>Merry Christmas</i>
<i>Merry Christmas</i>

731
01:25:24.683 --> 01:25:27.600
<i>Cast a Christmas spell</i>

732
01:25:41.187 --> 01:25:44.514
Knight to e5.

733
01:25:52.186 --> 01:25:54.354
Queen to e5.

734
01:25:59.978 --> 01:26:01.397
That's totally barbaric!

735
01:26:02.016 --> 01:26:05.562
That's wizard's chess.
I see you've packed.

736
01:26:05.762 --> 01:26:07.221
I see you haven't.

737
01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:12.725
Change of plans. My parents went
to Romania to visit my brother Charlie.

738
01:26:12.935 --> 01:26:16.771
- He's studying dragons there.
- Good. You can help Harry.

739
01:26:16.971 --> 01:26:20.348
He's going to the library
to look up Nicholas Flamel.

740
01:26:20.557 --> 01:26:24.054
We've looked a hundred times!

741
01:26:24.683 --> 01:26:29.938
Not in the restricted section.
Happy Christmas.

742
01:26:32.146 --> 01:26:35.063
I think we've had
a bad influence on her.

743
01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:41.936
Harry, wake up!
Come on, Harry, wake up!

744
01:26:51.766 --> 01:26:55.103
- Happy Christmas, Harry.
- Happy Christmas, Ron.

745
01:26:55.313 --> 01:26:57.520
What are you wearing?

746
01:26:58.100 --> 01:27:01.806
Oh, my mum made it.
Looks like you've got one too.

747
01:27:02.935 --> 01:27:05.353
- I've got presents?
- Yeah.

748
01:27:12.765 --> 01:27:14.853
There they are.

749
01:27:25.852 --> 01:27:29.349
"Your father left this
in my possession before he died.

750
01:27:29.598 --> 01:27:33.724
It is time it was returned to you.
Use it well."

751
01:27:50.517 --> 01:27:54.224
- What is it?
- Some kind of cloak.

752
01:27:54.513 --> 01:27:57.430
Well, let's see, then. Put it on.

753
01:28:02.855 --> 01:28:04.144
My body's gone!

754
01:28:04.354 --> 01:28:07.930
I know what that is.
That's an invisibility cloak!

755
01:28:08.479 --> 01:28:10.388
I'm invisible?

756
01:28:10.847 --> 01:28:15.263
They're really rare.
I wonder who gave it to you.

757
01:28:15.722 --> 01:28:20.517
There was no name.
It just said, "Use it well."

758
01:28:48.559 --> 01:28:54.433
<i>Famous Fire-Eaters.</i>
<i>Fifteenth-Century Fiends.</i>

759
01:28:54.643 --> 01:29:00.477
Flamel. Nicholas Flamel.
Where are you?

760
01:29:19.269 --> 01:29:21.187
Who's there?

761
01:29:27.311 --> 01:29:32.935
I know you're in there.
You can't hide.

762
01:29:40.308 --> 01:29:44.054
Who is it? Show yourself.

763
01:30:31.187 --> 01:30:32.555
Severus, I...

764
01:30:33.225 --> 01:30:37.101
You don't want me
as your enemy, Quirrell.

765
01:30:37.310 --> 01:30:42.016
- I don't know what you mean.
- You know perfectly well what I mean.

766
01:30:59.229 --> 01:31:02.435
We'll have another little chat soon.

767
01:31:02.645 --> 01:31:08.100
When you've had time to decide
where your loyalties lie.

768
01:31:08.349 --> 01:31:12.765
Professors. I found this
in the restricted section.

769
01:31:13.304 --> 01:31:18.349
It's still hot. That means
there's a student out of bed.

770
01:32:50.347 --> 01:32:52.185
Mum?

771
01:32:55.432 --> 01:32:57.430
Dad?

772
01:33:32.145 --> 01:33:37.100
Ron, you've really gotta see this!
Ron, you've gotta see this!

773
01:33:38.929 --> 01:33:41.806
Ron, come on, get out of bed!

774
01:33:42.016 --> 01:33:45.602
- Why?
- There's something you've got to see!

775
01:33:52.305 --> 01:33:56.601
Come on! Come!
Come look, it's my parents!

776
01:33:58.060 --> 01:34:00.018
I only see us.

777
01:34:00.267 --> 01:34:03.604
Look in properly.
Go on, stand there.

778
01:34:03.804 --> 01:34:09.728
- There. You see them, don't you?
- That's me! Only I'm head boy.

779
01:34:10.227 --> 01:34:12.555
And I'm holding the Quidditch Cup.

780
01:34:12.805 --> 01:34:16.971
And bloody hell!
I'm Quidditch captain too!

781
01:34:18.099 --> 01:34:20.557
I look good.

782
01:34:21.186 --> 01:34:25.013
Harry, do you think this mirror
shows the future?

783
01:34:25.222 --> 01:34:30.187
How can it?
Both my parents are dead.

784
01:34:53.304 --> 01:34:55.472
Back again, Harry?

785
01:34:58.559 --> 01:35:01.056
I see that you,
like many before you...

786
01:35:01.266 --> 01:35:05.432
have discovered the delights
of the Mirror of Erised.

787
01:35:05.772 --> 01:35:09.938
I trust by now
you realize what it does.

788
01:35:11.226 --> 01:35:13.764
Let me give you a clue.

789
01:35:14.313 --> 01:35:16.431
The happiest man on earth...

790
01:35:16.641 --> 01:35:20.017
would look in the mirror
and see only himself...

791
01:35:20.227 --> 01:35:22.555
exactly as he is.

792
01:35:22.765 --> 01:35:27.810
So then, it shows us what we want.
Whatever we want.

793
01:35:28.019 --> 01:35:30.767
Yes. And no.

794
01:35:31.806 --> 01:35:34.263
It shows us nothing more or less...

795
01:35:34.473 --> 01:35:40.437
than the deepest and most desperate
desires of our hearts.

796
01:35:40.647 --> 01:35:45.352
Now you, Harry, who have
never known your family...

797
01:35:45.562 --> 01:35:49.438
you see them standing beside you.

798
01:35:49.638 --> 01:35:52.055
But remember this, Harry.

799
01:35:52.305 --> 01:35:58.179
This mirror gives us
neither knowledge...

800
01:35:58.389 --> 01:36:00.517
or truth.

801
01:36:01.476 --> 01:36:07.520
Men have wasted away in front of it.
Even gone mad.

802
01:36:08.559 --> 01:36:12.685
That is why tomorrow
it will be moved to a new home.

803
01:36:12.895 --> 01:36:14.813
And I must ask you...

804
01:36:15.772 --> 01:36:19.638
not to go looking for it again.

805
01:36:20.387 --> 01:36:23.514
It does not do to dwell on dreams...

806
01:36:24.103 --> 01:36:26.970
and forget to live.

807
01:37:21.646 --> 01:37:27.310
I had you looking in the wrong section.
How could I be so stupid?

808
01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:30.647
I checked this out weeks ago
for a bit of light reading.

809
01:37:30.847 --> 01:37:32.854
This is light?

810
01:37:37.430 --> 01:37:39.847
Of course! Here it is!

811
01:37:40.057 --> 01:37:44.063
Nicholas Flamel is the only known
maker of the Philosopher's Stone.

812
01:37:44.313 --> 01:37:45.472
The what?

813
01:37:46.141 --> 01:37:49.138
Honestly, don't you two read?

814
01:37:49.348 --> 01:37:53.853
"The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary
substance with astonishing powers.

815
01:37:54.063 --> 01:37:56.681
It'll transform any metal
into pure gold...

816
01:37:56.890 --> 01:38:00.896
and produces the Elixir of Life
which will make the drinker immortal."

817
01:38:01.096 --> 01:38:03.264
- Immortal?
- It means you'll never die.

818
01:38:03.474 --> 01:38:05.562
I know what it means!

819
01:38:06.431 --> 01:38:11.146
"The only Stone currently in existence
belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel...

820
01:38:11.346 --> 01:38:16.521
the noted alchemist who last year
celebrated his 665th birthday."

821
01:38:18.229 --> 01:38:20.387
That's what Fluffy's guarding.

822
01:38:20.597 --> 01:38:25.312
That's what's under the trap door.
The Philosopher's Stone.

823
01:38:42.055 --> 01:38:45.851
Don't wish to be rude,
but I'm in no state to entertain.

824
01:38:46.061 --> 01:38:48.769
We know about the Philosopher's Stone.

825
01:38:53.474 --> 01:38:58.599
- We think Snape's trying to steal it.
- Are you still on about him?

826
01:38:58.808 --> 01:39:01.596
We know he's after it.
We don't know why.

827
01:39:01.975 --> 01:39:06.141
Snape is one of the teachers
protecting the Stone. He won't steal it.

828
01:39:06.391 --> 01:39:07.480
What?

829
01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:11.056
You heard. Come on,
I'm a bit preoccupied today.

830
01:39:11.266 --> 01:39:13.973
Wait a minute.
"One of the teachers"?

831
01:39:14.143 --> 01:39:18.019
There are other things
defending the Stone, aren't there?

832
01:39:18.229 --> 01:39:20.846
- Spells, enchantments.
- Right.

833
01:39:21.096 --> 01:39:24.143
Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.

834
01:39:24.353 --> 01:39:26.431
Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy.

835
01:39:26.641 --> 01:39:30.307
Ain't a soul knows how,
except for me and Dumbledore.

836
01:39:30.557 --> 01:39:34.143
I shouldn't have told you that.
I should not have told you that.

837
01:39:47.979 --> 01:39:53.054
- Hagrid, what exactly is that?
- That? It's...

838
01:39:53.304 --> 01:39:55.312
I know what that is!

839
01:39:55.522 --> 01:39:58.139
But, Hagrid, how did you get one?

840
01:39:58.519 --> 01:40:01.765
I won it. Off a stranger
I met down at the pub.

841
01:40:01.975 --> 01:40:06.061
Seemed quite glad to be rid of it,
as a matter of fact.

842
01:40:28.269 --> 01:40:30.477
Is that...

843
01:40:31.266 --> 01:40:32.435
a dragon?

844
01:40:32.645 --> 01:40:37.060
That's not just a dragon.
That's a Norwegian Ridgeback.

845
01:40:37.270 --> 01:40:40.137
My brother works
with these in Romania.

846
01:40:40.347 --> 01:40:45.222
Isn't he beautiful? Oh, bless him.
Look, he knows his mummy.

847
01:40:45.891 --> 01:40:47.640
Hello, Norbert.

848
01:40:47.979 --> 01:40:52.265
- Norbert?
- He's gotta have a name, don't he?

849
01:40:53.014 --> 01:40:55.472
Don't you, Norbert?

850
01:41:02.435 --> 01:41:05.562
He'll have to be trained up a bit,
of course.

851
01:41:09.438 --> 01:41:11.516
Who's that?

852
01:41:13.224 --> 01:41:15.312
Malfoy.

853
01:41:16.061 --> 01:41:17.480
Oh, dear.

854
01:41:19.188 --> 01:41:23.973
Hagrid always wanted a dragon.
Told me so the first time I met him.

855
01:41:24.183 --> 01:41:28.229
It's crazy.
And worse, Malfoy knows.

856
01:41:28.429 --> 01:41:32.515
- I don't understand. Is that bad?
- It's bad.

857
01:41:32.804 --> 01:41:34.972
Good evening.

858
01:41:38.599 --> 01:41:41.516
Nothing, I repeat, nothing...

859
01:41:41.765 --> 01:41:45.272
gives a student the right
to walk about at night.

860
01:41:45.472 --> 01:41:50.347
Therefore, as punishment for your actions,
50 points will be taken.

861
01:41:50.557 --> 01:41:52.894
- 50?
- Each.

862
01:41:53.933 --> 01:41:56.311
To ensure it doesn't happen again...

863
01:41:56.521 --> 01:41:59.847
all four of you
will receive detention.

864
01:42:00.766 --> 01:42:03.723
Excuse me, professor,
perhaps I heard you wrong.

865
01:42:03.933 --> 01:42:06.271
I thought you said the four of us.

866
01:42:06.471 --> 01:42:08.978
No, you heard me correctly.

867
01:42:09.188 --> 01:42:14.183
Honorable as your intentions were,
you too were out of bed after hours.

868
01:42:14.642 --> 01:42:17.599
You will join your classmates
in detention.

869
01:42:28.808 --> 01:42:32.804
A pity they let
the old punishments die.

870
01:42:33.014 --> 01:42:37.729
Was a time detention found you
hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons.

871
01:42:37.929 --> 01:42:40.766
God, I miss the screaming.

872
01:42:43.304 --> 01:42:46.600
You'll be serving detention
with Hagrid tonight.

873
01:42:46.810 --> 01:42:52.185
He's got a little job to do
inside the Dark Forest.

874
01:42:54.223 --> 01:42:57.180
A sorry lot, this, Hagrid.

875
01:42:58.638 --> 01:43:03.643
Good God, you're not still on
about that bloody dragon, are you?

876
01:43:05.891 --> 01:43:07.979
Norbert's gone.

877
01:43:08.518 --> 01:43:12.055
Dumbledore sent him off to Romania
to live in a colony.

878
01:43:12.355 --> 01:43:15.601
That's good, isn't it?
He's with his own kind.

879
01:43:15.771 --> 01:43:18.099
What if he don't like Romania?

880
01:43:18.309 --> 01:43:22.554
What if the other dragons are mean
to him? He's only a baby.

881
01:43:23.184 --> 01:43:28.429
For God's sake, pull yourself together.
You're going into the Forest.

882
01:43:28.638 --> 01:43:31.016
Got to have your wits about you.

883
01:43:31.226 --> 01:43:36.890
The Forest? I thought that was a joke.
We can't go in there.

884
01:43:37.350 --> 01:43:41.186
Students aren't allowed.
And there are...

885
01:43:42.724 --> 01:43:43.973
werewolves.

886
01:43:44.393 --> 01:43:47.679
There's more than werewolves
in those trees.

887
01:43:47.889 --> 01:43:50.596
You can be sure of that.

888
01:43:52.514 --> 01:43:53.933
Nighty-night.

889
01:43:56.520 --> 01:43:59.348
Right. Let's go.

890
01:44:37.519 --> 01:44:39.937
Hagrid, what is that?

891
01:44:40.147 --> 01:44:43.513
What we're here for.
See that?

892
01:44:44.013 --> 01:44:49.388
That's unicorn blood, that is.
I found one dead a few weeks ago.

893
01:44:49.937 --> 01:44:54.512
Now, this one's been hurt bad
by something.

894
01:45:02.015 --> 01:45:07.769
So, it's our job to go
and find the poor beast.

895
01:45:07.979 --> 01:45:11.096
Ron, Hermione, come with me.

896
01:45:11.555 --> 01:45:14.852
And, Harry, you'll go with Malfoy.

897
01:45:16.101 --> 01:45:18.388
Okay. Then I get Fang.

898
01:45:18.558 --> 01:45:24.313
Fine. Just so you know,
he's a bloody coward.

899
01:45:27.979 --> 01:45:32.974
Wait till my father hears about this.
This is servant's stuff.

900
01:45:33.184 --> 01:45:37.100
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were scared.

901
01:45:37.310 --> 01:45:39.887
I'm not scared, Potter.

902
01:45:41.016 --> 01:45:42.974
Do you hear that?

903
01:45:45.521 --> 01:45:46.930
Come on, Fang.

904
01:45:47.140 --> 01:45:48.638
Scared!

905
01:46:13.603 --> 01:46:15.771
What is it, Fang?

906
01:47:26.061 --> 01:47:31.555
Harry Potter, you must leave.
You are known to many creatures here.

907
01:47:31.765 --> 01:47:35.771
The Forest is not safe at this time.
Especially for you.

908
01:47:35.971 --> 01:47:38.728
What was that thing you saved me from?

909
01:47:38.938 --> 01:47:44.312
A monstrous creature.
It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn.

910
01:47:44.472 --> 01:47:50.017
Drinking its blood will keep you alive
even if you are an inch from death.

911
01:47:50.227 --> 01:47:55.311
But at a terrible price. For you
have slain something so pure...

912
01:47:55.521 --> 01:48:00.346
that the moment the blood touches
your lips, you will have a half-life.

913
01:48:00.556 --> 01:48:02.354
A cursed life.

914
01:48:02.554 --> 01:48:06.520
- Who would choose such a life?
- Can you think of no one?

915
01:48:06.730 --> 01:48:11.685
Do you mean to say that
that thing that killed the unicorn...

916
01:48:12.015 --> 01:48:15.931
that was drinking its blood,
that was Voldemort?

917
01:48:16.141 --> 01:48:21.305
Do you know what is hidden
in the school at this very moment?

918
01:48:22.145 --> 01:48:23.683
The Philosopher's Stone.

919
01:48:25.022 --> 01:48:27.020
Harry!

920
01:48:27.599 --> 01:48:32.105
Hello there, Firenze.
See you've met our young Mr. Potter.

921
01:48:32.304 --> 01:48:34.472
You all right there, Harry?

922
01:48:35.601 --> 01:48:39.897
Harry Potter,
this is where I leave you.

923
01:48:40.766 --> 01:48:44.602
You're safe now. Good luck.

924
01:48:52.224 --> 01:48:56.350
You mean, You-Know-Who is out there
right now in the Forest?

925
01:48:56.560 --> 01:48:59.347
But he's weak.
He's living off the unicorns.

926
01:48:59.557 --> 01:49:02.474
Don't you see? We had it wrong.

927
01:49:02.684 --> 01:49:07.060
Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself.
He wants it for Voldemort.

928
01:49:07.269 --> 01:49:11.805
With the Elixir of Life,
Voldemort will be strong again.

929
01:49:12.015 --> 01:49:13.603
He'll come back.

930
01:49:13.813 --> 01:49:15.561
But if he comes back...

931
01:49:15.811 --> 01:49:19.767
you don't think he'll try
to kill you, do you?

932
01:49:20.766 --> 01:49:24.312
If he'd had the chance,
he might have tried tonight.

933
01:49:24.512 --> 01:49:28.099
And to think I've been worrying
about my Potions final.

934
01:49:28.308 --> 01:49:31.895
Hang on a minute.
We're forgetting one thing.

935
01:49:32.264 --> 01:49:37.139
Who's the one wizard
Voldemort always feared?

936
01:49:37.889 --> 01:49:43.014
Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore
is around, Harry, you're safe.

937
01:49:43.223 --> 01:49:47.269
As long as Dumbledore is around,
you can't be touched.

938
01:49:53.014 --> 01:49:58.438
I'd heard Hogwarts' final exams were
frightful, but I found that enjoyable.

939
01:49:58.638 --> 01:50:02.304
Speak for yourself.
All right there, Harry?

940
01:50:02.514 --> 01:50:07.679
- My scar. It keeps burning.
- It's happened before.

941
01:50:07.889 --> 01:50:10.596
- Not like this.
- You should see the nurse.

942
01:50:10.766 --> 01:50:14.262
I think it's a warning.
It means danger's coming.

943
01:50:21.895 --> 01:50:24.352
- Of course!
- What is it?

944
01:50:24.562 --> 01:50:28.308
Isn't it odd that what Hagrid wants
more than anything is a dragon...

945
01:50:28.518 --> 01:50:31.605
and a stranger just happens
to have one?

946
01:50:31.805 --> 01:50:34.512
How many people wander around
with dragon eggs?

947
01:50:34.682 --> 01:50:36.930
Why didn't I see it before?

948
01:50:42.514 --> 01:50:46.021
Who gave you the egg?
What did he look like?

949
01:50:46.220 --> 01:50:48.978
I never saw his face.
He kept his hood up.

950
01:50:49.187 --> 01:50:51.765
You and this stranger
must have talked.

951
01:50:52.354 --> 01:50:55.891
He wanted to know what sort
of creatures I looked after.

952
01:50:56.100 --> 01:51:00.096
I said, "After Fluffy,
a dragon's gonna be no problem."

953
01:51:00.306 --> 01:51:04.772
- Was he interested in Fluffy?
- Of course he was interested.

954
01:51:05.181 --> 01:51:09.347
How often do you come across
a three-headed dog?

955
01:51:09.557 --> 01:51:15.181
But I told him, "The trick with any beast
is to know how to calm him."

956
01:51:15.391 --> 01:51:20.846
Take Fluffy, for example. Play him
music and he falls straight to sleep.

957
01:51:22.474 --> 01:51:25.181
I shouldn't have told you that.

958
01:51:25.431 --> 01:51:27.639
Where are you going?

959
01:51:34.642 --> 01:51:37.389
We have to see Dumbledore.
Immediately!

960
01:51:37.849 --> 01:51:40.476
I'm afraid he's not here.

961
01:51:40.686 --> 01:51:44.972
He received an urgent owl
from the Ministry of Magic and left.

962
01:51:45.391 --> 01:51:47.929
He's gone?
But this is important!

963
01:51:48.188 --> 01:51:50.396
This is about the Philosopher's Stone!

964
01:51:52.304 --> 01:51:56.020
- How do you know?
- Someone's going to try and steal it.

965
01:51:56.640 --> 01:52:01.855
I don't know how you know,
but I assure you it is well protected.

966
01:52:02.054 --> 01:52:06.350
Now would you go back
to your dormitories? Quietly.

967
01:52:14.642 --> 01:52:17.429
That was no stranger Hagrid met.
It was Snape.

968
01:52:17.639 --> 01:52:20.346
Which means he knows
how to get past Fluffy.

969
01:52:20.516 --> 01:52:24.392
- And with Dumbledore gone...
- Good afternoon.

970
01:52:26.430 --> 01:52:29.517
What would three young Gryffindors...

971
01:52:29.767 --> 01:52:34.062
be doing inside on a day like this?

972
01:52:38.808 --> 01:52:42.354
- We were just...
- You ought to be careful.

973
01:52:42.894 --> 01:52:44.852
People will think you're...

974
01:52:49.137 --> 01:52:51.855
up to something.

975
01:53:02.144 --> 01:53:04.142
Now what do we do?

976
01:53:04.352 --> 01:53:08.098
We go down the trap door. Tonight.

977
01:53:21.855 --> 01:53:23.313
Trevor.

978
01:53:23.643 --> 01:53:27.059
Trevor, go! You shouldn't be here!

979
01:53:27.309 --> 01:53:32.724
Neither should you.
You're sneaking out again, aren't you?

980
01:53:32.933 --> 01:53:36.889
- Neville, listen. We were...
- No, I won't let you!

981
01:53:37.139 --> 01:53:41.725
You'll get Gryffindor into trouble again.
I'll fight you.

982
01:53:41.934 --> 01:53:46.230
Neville, I'm really sorry about this.
<i>Petrificus Totalus.</i>

983
01:53:54.182 --> 01:53:57.978
You're a little scary sometimes,
you know that?

984
01:53:58.228 --> 01:54:01.855
Brilliant, but scary.

985
01:54:02.514 --> 01:54:04.562
Let's go.

986
01:54:04.772 --> 01:54:09.017
- Sorry.
- It's for your own good, you know.

987
01:54:14.432 --> 01:54:18.388
- You stood on my foot!
- Sorry.

988
01:54:22.264 --> 01:54:24.312
<i>Alohomora.</i>

989
01:54:36.310 --> 01:54:38.887
Wait a minute. He's...

990
01:54:40.096 --> 01:54:42.264
snoring.

991
01:54:44.772 --> 01:54:50.306
Snape's already been here.
He's put a spell on the harp.

992
01:54:51.894 --> 01:54:54.891
It's got horrible breath.

993
01:54:57.479 --> 01:54:59.557
- We have to move its paw.
- What?

994
01:54:59.767 --> 01:55:01.185
Come on!

995
01:55:05.221 --> 01:55:07.309
Okay. Push.

996
01:55:30.436 --> 01:55:34.062
I'll go first. Don't follow
until I give you a sign.

997
01:55:34.262 --> 01:55:39.267
If something bad happens,
get yourselves out.

998
01:55:40.056 --> 01:55:43.513
Does it seem a bit quiet to you?

999
01:55:44.222 --> 01:55:46.060
The harp.

1000
01:55:46.730 --> 01:55:49.437
It's stopped playing.

1001
01:55:59.477 --> 01:56:00.596
Jump!

1002
01:56:14.771 --> 01:56:18.388
Lucky this plant thing's here, really.

1003
01:56:32.813 --> 01:56:35.890
Stop moving, both of you.
This is Devil's Snare.

1004
01:56:36.100 --> 01:56:39.806
You have to relax. If you don't,
it will only kill you faster.

1005
01:56:40.016 --> 01:56:45.021
Kill us faster?
Oh, now I can relax!

1006
01:56:47.269 --> 01:56:48.598
Hermione!

1007
01:56:49.187 --> 01:56:52.973
- Now what are we gonna do?
- Just relax!

1008
01:56:53.183 --> 01:56:57.688
- Hermione, where are you?
- Do what I say! Trust me.

1009
01:57:04.771 --> 01:57:08.098
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1010
01:57:08.308 --> 01:57:11.355
- He's not relaxing, is he?
- Apparently not.

1011
01:57:11.555 --> 01:57:14.102
- We've gotta do something.
- What?

1012
01:57:14.312 --> 01:57:17.229
I remember reading something
in Herbology.

1013
01:57:18.098 --> 01:57:21.934
Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare.
It's deadly fun...

1014
01:57:22.144 --> 01:57:26.520
but will sulk in the sun!
That's it! It hates sunlight.

1015
01:57:26.769 --> 01:57:28.807
<i>Lumus Solem.</i>

1016
01:57:36.889 --> 01:57:39.477
- Ron, you okay?
- Yeah.

1017
01:57:42.184 --> 01:57:44.641
Lucky we didn't panic.

1018
01:57:45.391 --> 01:57:48.887
Lucky Hermione pays attention
in Herbology.

1019
01:57:50.516 --> 01:57:52.014
What is that?

1020
01:57:52.224 --> 01:57:55.930
I don't know. Sounds like wings.

1021
01:58:09.057 --> 01:58:12.514
Curious. I've never seen
birds like these.

1022
01:58:12.723 --> 01:58:16.350
They're not birds.
They're keys.

1023
01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:20.016
And I'll bet one of them
fits that door.

1024
01:58:23.473 --> 01:58:28.098
- What's this all about?
- I don't know.

1025
01:58:33.972 --> 01:58:36.020
Strange.

1026
01:58:36.430 --> 01:58:38.727
<i>Alohomora!</i>

1027
01:58:41.684 --> 01:58:43.932
Well, it was worth a try.

1028
01:58:44.142 --> 01:58:47.389
What will we do?
There must be a thousand keys.

1029
01:58:47.598 --> 01:58:51.515
We want a big, old-fashioned one.
Probably rusty.

1030
01:58:51.724 --> 01:58:55.141
I see it!
The one with the broken wing.

1031
01:58:58.727 --> 01:59:01.055
What's wrong?

1032
01:59:01.934 --> 01:59:03.433
It's too simple.

1033
01:59:03.642 --> 01:59:08.388
Go on! If Snape could catch it
on that old broomstick, you can.

1034
01:59:08.597 --> 01:59:12.144
You're the youngest Seeker
in a century.

1035
01:59:28.977 --> 01:59:31.974
This complicates things a bit.

1036
01:59:53.223 --> 01:59:55.141
Catch the key!

1037
01:59:59.556 --> 02:00:01.475
Hurry up!

1038
02:00:33.932 --> 02:00:38.597
I don't like this.
I don't like this at all.

1039
02:00:38.807 --> 02:00:41.974
Where are we? A graveyard.

1040
02:00:42.354 --> 02:00:44.971
This is no graveyard.

1041
02:00:52.473 --> 02:00:55.391
It's a chessboard.

1042
02:01:07.349 --> 02:01:09.267
There's the door.

1043
02:01:21.305 --> 02:01:22.813
Now what do we do?

1044
02:01:23.183 --> 02:01:27.309
It's obvious, isn't it? We've got
to play our way across the room.

1045
02:01:27.888 --> 02:01:31.644
Harry, you take
the empty bishop's square.

1046
02:01:31.974 --> 02:01:36.180
Hermione, you'll be
the queen-side castle.

1047
02:01:36.429 --> 02:01:40.475
As for me, I'll be a knight.

1048
02:01:47.638 --> 02:01:49.347
What happens now?

1049
02:01:50.146 --> 02:01:53.143
Well, white moves first.

1050
02:01:53.353 --> 02:01:55.221
And then...

1051
02:01:56.979 --> 02:01:58.228
we play.

1052
02:02:08.807 --> 02:02:13.852
Ron, you don't suppose
this is going to be like...

1053
02:02:14.102 --> 02:02:17.638
real wizard's chess, do you?

1054
02:02:18.018 --> 02:02:20.975
You there, d5.

1055
02:02:35.560 --> 02:02:37.139
Yes, Hermione.

1056
02:02:37.348 --> 02:02:42.433
I think this is gonna be
exactly like wizard's chess.

1057
02:02:48.347 --> 02:02:50.855
Castle to e4!

1058
02:02:54.471 --> 02:02:56.769
Pawn to c3!

1059
02:03:41.354 --> 02:03:45.350
- Wait a minute.
- You understand right, Harry.

1060
02:03:45.600 --> 02:03:50.305
Once I make my move,
the queen will take me.

1061
02:03:50.935 --> 02:03:53.263
Then you're free to check the king.

1062
02:03:53.472 --> 02:03:56.180
- No. Ron, no!
- What is it?

1063
02:03:56.809 --> 02:04:01.474
- He's going to sacrifice himself.
- No, there must be another way!

1064
02:04:01.684 --> 02:04:05.430
Do you wanna stop Snape
from getting that Stone or not?

1065
02:04:05.640 --> 02:04:09.227
Harry, it's you that has to go on.
I know it.

1066
02:04:09.726 --> 02:04:12.473
Not me. Not Hermione. You.

1067
02:04:22.723 --> 02:04:25.640
Knight to h3.

1068
02:04:46.559 --> 02:04:48.557
Check.

1069
02:05:17.688 --> 02:05:19.476
Ron!

1070
02:05:19.686 --> 02:05:25.470
No, don't move!
Don't forget, we're still playing.

1071
02:05:40.515 --> 02:05:41.804
Checkmate.

1072
02:06:01.724 --> 02:06:04.221
Take care of Ron.
Then go to the owlery.

1073
02:06:04.431 --> 02:06:08.307
Send a message to Dumbledore.
Ron's right.

1074
02:06:08.517 --> 02:06:10.395
I have to go on.

1075
02:06:10.895 --> 02:06:16.809
You'll be okay, Harry.
You're a great wizard. You really are.

1076
02:06:17.019 --> 02:06:19.516
Not as good as you.

1077
02:06:20.345 --> 02:06:25.180
Me? Books and cleverness.
There are more important things.

1078
02:06:26.389 --> 02:06:32.014
Friendship and bravery.
And, Harry, just be careful.

1079
02:07:10.056 --> 02:07:11.724
You?

1080
02:07:12.513 --> 02:07:16.349
No, it can't be.
Snape, he was the...

1081
02:07:16.559 --> 02:07:19.596
Yes, he does seem the type,
doesn't he?

1082
02:07:19.806 --> 02:07:22.933
Next to him, who would suspect...

1083
02:07:23.142 --> 02:07:27.058
poor, stuttering
Professor Quirrell?

1084
02:07:27.268 --> 02:07:32.643
But that day, during the Quidditch match,
Snape tried to kill me.

1085
02:07:32.853 --> 02:07:35.640
No, dear boy. I tried to kill you!

1086
02:07:36.139 --> 02:07:40.305
If Snape's cloak hadn't caught
fire and broken my eye contact...

1087
02:07:40.515 --> 02:07:42.723
I would have succeeded.

1088
02:07:42.933 --> 02:07:45.930
Even with Snape muttering
his countercurse.

1089
02:07:46.139 --> 02:07:48.347
Snape was trying to save me?

1090
02:07:48.557 --> 02:07:53.932
I knew you were a danger to me,
especially after Halloween.

1091
02:07:54.101 --> 02:07:58.347
- Then you let the troll in!
- Very good, Potter, yes.

1092
02:07:58.557 --> 02:08:01.554
Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled.

1093
02:08:02.143 --> 02:08:07.098
While everyone ran about,
he went to the third floor to head me off.

1094
02:08:08.017 --> 02:08:11.514
He, of course, never trusted me again.

1095
02:08:12.513 --> 02:08:17.768
He rarely left me alone.
But he doesn't understand.

1096
02:08:17.978 --> 02:08:22.013
I'm never alone. Never.

1097
02:08:22.223 --> 02:08:26.309
Now, what does this mirror do?

1098
02:08:27.888 --> 02:08:30.015
I see what I desire.

1099
02:08:30.555 --> 02:08:34.971
I see myself holding the Stone.
But how do I get it?

1100
02:08:35.180 --> 02:08:37.348
Use the boy.

1101
02:08:38.137 --> 02:08:42.063
Come here, Potter! Now!

1102
02:08:54.141 --> 02:08:58.137
Tell me, what do you see?

1103
02:09:23.262 --> 02:09:25.680
What is it? What do you see?

1104
02:09:25.890 --> 02:09:31.054
I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore.
I've won the house cup.

1105
02:09:31.264 --> 02:09:32.813
He lies.

1106
02:09:33.312 --> 02:09:37.018
Tell the truth! What do you see?

1107
02:09:37.228 --> 02:09:41.604
- Let me speak to him.
- Master, you are not strong enough.

1108
02:09:41.854 --> 02:09:45.850
I have strength enough for this.

1109
02:10:04.021 --> 02:10:06.889
Harry Potter...

1110
02:10:07.098 --> 02:10:09.436
we meet again.

1111
02:10:09.646 --> 02:10:11.054
Voldemort.

1112
02:10:11.264 --> 02:10:15.230
Yes. You see what I've become?

1113
02:10:15.480 --> 02:10:19.056
See what I must do to survive?

1114
02:10:19.266 --> 02:10:23.392
Live off another. A mere parasite.

1115
02:10:24.061 --> 02:10:27.388
Unicorn blood can sustain me...

1116
02:10:27.598 --> 02:10:31.264
but it cannot give me
a body of my own.

1117
02:10:31.474 --> 02:10:35.020
But there is something that can.

1118
02:10:35.230 --> 02:10:40.894
Something that, conveniently enough,
lies in your pocket.

1119
02:10:41.264 --> 02:10:42.813
Stop him!

1120
02:10:47.848 --> 02:10:50.605
Don't be a fool.

1121
02:10:51.104 --> 02:10:54.221
Why suffer an horrific death...

1122
02:10:54.431 --> 02:10:58.057
when you can join me and live?

1123
02:10:58.267 --> 02:10:59.346
Never!

1124
02:11:01.354 --> 02:11:06.139
Bravery. Your parents had it too.

1125
02:11:06.888 --> 02:11:10.185
Tell me, Harry...

1126
02:11:10.435 --> 02:11:14.311
would you like to see
your mother and father again?

1127
02:11:14.561 --> 02:11:16.639
Together...

1128
02:11:16.848 --> 02:11:19.396
we can bring them back.

1129
02:11:19.806 --> 02:11:24.521
All I ask is for something in return.

1130
02:11:31.224 --> 02:11:34.351
That's it, Harry.

1131
02:11:35.230 --> 02:11:39.096
There is no good and evil.

1132
02:11:39.306 --> 02:11:42.313
There is only power...

1133
02:11:42.513 --> 02:11:46.639
and those too weak to seek it.

1134
02:11:47.308 --> 02:11:52.353
Together, we'll do
extraordinary things.

1135
02:11:52.763 --> 02:11:55.020
Just give me the Stone!

1136
02:11:57.638 --> 02:11:58.806
You liar!

1137
02:11:59.016 --> 02:12:01.144
Kill him!

1138
02:12:24.641 --> 02:12:30.015
- What is this magic?
- Fool, get the Stone!

1139
02:14:15.140 --> 02:14:17.638
Good afternoon, Harry.

1140
02:14:19.765 --> 02:14:24.271
- Tokens from your admirers?
- Admirers?

1141
02:14:24.471 --> 02:14:30.475
What happened in the dungeons between
you and Professor Quirrell is a secret.

1142
02:14:30.684 --> 02:14:35.480
So, naturally, the whole school knows.

1143
02:14:37.807 --> 02:14:41.434
I see that your friend Ronald
has saved you the trouble...

1144
02:14:41.643 --> 02:14:44.471
of opening your Chocolate Frogs.

1145
02:14:44.680 --> 02:14:47.687
Ron was here? Is he all right?
What about Hermione?

1146
02:14:47.887 --> 02:14:52.762
Fine. They're both just fine.

1147
02:14:53.352 --> 02:14:56.139
- What happened to the Stone?
- Relax, dear boy.

1148
02:14:56.479 --> 02:14:59.306
The Stone has been destroyed.

1149
02:14:59.556 --> 02:15:03.771
My friend Nicholas and I
have had a little chat...

1150
02:15:03.971 --> 02:15:07.937
and agreed it was best all around.

1151
02:15:08.137 --> 02:15:11.973
But then, Flamel,
he'll die, won't he?

1152
02:15:14.021 --> 02:15:19.516
He has enough Elixir
to set his affairs in order.

1153
02:15:19.725 --> 02:15:22.932
But yes, he will die.

1154
02:15:23.142 --> 02:15:25.599
How is it I got the Stone, sir?

1155
02:15:25.809 --> 02:15:28.347
One minute I was staring
in the mirror and...

1156
02:15:28.557 --> 02:15:32.642
You see, only a person...

1157
02:15:32.932 --> 02:15:36.848
who wanted to find the Stone,
find it...

1158
02:15:37.098 --> 02:15:41.643
but not use it,
would be able to get it.

1159
02:15:42.602 --> 02:15:46.099
That is one of my more brilliant ideas.

1160
02:15:46.309 --> 02:15:51.354
And between you and me,
that is saying something.

1161
02:15:52.812 --> 02:15:58.017
Does that mean, with the Stone gone,
that Voldemort can never come back?

1162
02:15:58.227 --> 02:16:00.554
I'm afraid...

1163
02:16:01.973 --> 02:16:06.019
there are ways
in which he can return.

1164
02:16:06.728 --> 02:16:09.306
Harry, do you know why...

1165
02:16:09.516 --> 02:16:13.522
Professor Quirrell couldn't bear
to have you touch him?

1166
02:16:13.721 --> 02:16:18.347
It was because of your mother.
She sacrificed herself for you.

1167
02:16:18.896 --> 02:16:22.103
And that kind of act leaves a mark.

1168
02:16:22.313 --> 02:16:26.099
No, this kind of mark cannot be seen.

1169
02:16:26.309 --> 02:16:31.224
- It lives in your very skin.
- What is it?

1170
02:16:32.063 --> 02:16:35.809
Love, Harry. Love.

1171
02:16:43.851 --> 02:16:47.977
Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.

1172
02:16:48.187 --> 02:16:52.852
I was most unfortunate in my youth
to come across a vomit-flavored one.

1173
02:16:53.102 --> 02:16:56.389
And since then,
I've lost my liking for them.

1174
02:16:56.598 --> 02:16:59.975
But I think I could be safe...

1175
02:17:00.185 --> 02:17:02.562
with a nice toffee.

1176
02:17:06.638 --> 02:17:08.187
Alas!

1177
02:17:08.896 --> 02:17:11.014
Earwax.

1178
02:17:26.229 --> 02:17:29.396
- All right there, Ron?
- All right. You?

1179
02:17:30.514 --> 02:17:33.222
All right. Hermione?

1180
02:17:33.891 --> 02:17:35.729
Never better.

1181
02:17:51.513 --> 02:17:53.971
Another year gone.

1182
02:17:54.720 --> 02:17:59.266
And now, as I understand it,
the house cup needs awarding.

1183
02:17:59.475 --> 02:18:02.103
And the points stand thus:

1184
02:18:02.313 --> 02:18:08.097
In fourth place,
Gryffindor with 312 points.

1185
02:18:10.055 --> 02:18:15.729
Third place,
Hufflepuff with 352 points.

1186
02:18:21.014 --> 02:18:22.812
In second place...

1187
02:18:23.012 --> 02:18:27.807
Ravenclaw with 426 points.

1188
02:18:33.471 --> 02:18:35.180
And in first place...

1189
02:18:35.519 --> 02:18:40.934
with 472 points, Slytherin house.

1190
02:18:46.518 --> 02:18:48.726
Nice one, mate.

1191
02:18:52.562 --> 02:18:56.638
Yes, well done, Slytherin.
Well done.

1192
02:18:56.888 --> 02:19:01.184
However, recent events must
be taken into account.

1193
02:19:01.393 --> 02:19:06.349
And I have a few last-minute points
to award.

1194
02:19:06.978 --> 02:19:12.472
To Miss Hermione Granger,
for the cool use of intellect...

1195
02:19:12.682 --> 02:19:15.479
while others were in grave peril...

1196
02:19:16.179 --> 02:19:18.436
50 points.

1197
02:19:19.345 --> 02:19:20.644
Good job.

1198
02:19:28.346 --> 02:19:34.390
Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley,
for the best-played game of chess...

1199
02:19:34.890 --> 02:19:40.145
that Hogwarts has seen
these many years, 50 points.

1200
02:19:44.770 --> 02:19:46.808
And third...

1201
02:19:47.347 --> 02:19:50.225
to Mr. Harry Potter...

1202
02:19:50.434 --> 02:19:54.730
for pure nerve
and outstanding courage...

1203
02:19:55.309 --> 02:20:00.185
I award Gryffindor house 60 points.

1204
02:20:08.476 --> 02:20:10.394
We're tied with Slytherin!

1205
02:20:10.604 --> 02:20:16.598
Finally, it takes a great deal of bravery
to stand up to your enemies...

1206
02:20:16.808 --> 02:20:20.684
but a great deal more
to stand up to your friends.

1207
02:20:20.894 --> 02:20:23.851
I award 10 points...

1208
02:20:24.061 --> 02:20:27.268
to Neville Longbottom.

1209
02:20:40.604 --> 02:20:44.021
Assuming that my calculations
are correct...

1210
02:20:44.221 --> 02:20:48.766
I believe that a change
of decoration is in order.

1211
02:20:53.811 --> 02:20:57.188
Gryffindor wins the house cup.

1212
02:21:35.180 --> 02:21:38.516
Come on, now.
Hurry up, you'll be late.

1213
02:21:38.726 --> 02:21:43.022
Train's leaving. Go on.
Come on, hurry up.

1214
02:21:48.436 --> 02:21:51.723
- Come on, Harry.
- One minute.

1215
02:21:57.977 --> 02:22:01.723
Thought you were leaving
without saying goodbye, did you?

1216
02:22:04.930 --> 02:22:06.768
This is for you.

1217
02:22:23.521 --> 02:22:25.639
Thanks, Hagrid.

1218
02:22:31.473 --> 02:22:35.889
Go on. On with you. On with you now.
Oh, listen, Harry.

1219
02:22:36.308 --> 02:22:40.764
If that dolt of a cousin of yours,
Dudley, gives you any grief...

1220
02:22:41.014 --> 02:22:43.721
you could always threaten him...

1221
02:22:43.891 --> 02:22:46.768
with a nice pair of ears
to go with his tail.

1222
02:22:46.978 --> 02:22:52.063
But we're not allowed to do magic
away from Hogwarts. You know that.

1223
02:22:52.512 --> 02:22:56.848
I do. But your cousin don't, do he?

1224
02:23:02.352 --> 02:23:05.479
Feels strange to be going home,
doesn't it?

1225
02:23:05.679 --> 02:23:07.767
I'm not going home.

1226
02:23:07.977 --> 02:23:09.895
Not really.
