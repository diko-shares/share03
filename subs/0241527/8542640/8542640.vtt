1
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.710
I should've known that you would
be here, Professor McGonagall.

2
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.110
Good evening, Professor Dumbledore.

3
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.609
Are the rumors true, Albus?

4
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.009
I'm afraid so, professor.
The good and the bad.

5
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.509
- And the boy?
- Hagrid is bringing him.

6
00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.909
Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid
with something as important as this?

7
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.110
Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid
with my life.

8
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.009
Professor Dumbledore, sir.
Professor McGonagall.

9
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.109
- No problems, I trust, Hagrid?
- No, sir.

10
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.910
Little tyke fell asleep just
as we were flying over Bristol.

11
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.110
Try not to wake him.

12
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.010
There you go.

13
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.909
Albus, do you really think it's safe,
leaving him with these people?

14
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.409
I've watched them all day.
They're the worst sort of Muggles, imaginable.

15
00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.609
- They really are...
- The only family he has.

16
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.209
This boy will be famous. There won't be a child
in our world who doesn't know his name.

17
00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:09.709
Exactly.

18
00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:14.310
He's far better off growing up
away from all of that.

19
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.510
Until he's ready.

20
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:37.010
There, there, Hagrid.
It's not really goodbye, after all.

21
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.410
Good luck...

22
00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.510
...Harry Potter.

23
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.110
Up. Get up!

24
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.310
Now!

25
00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.310
Wake up, cousin!
We're going to the zoo!

26
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.810
- Here he comes, the birthday boy.
- Happy birthday, son.

27
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.709
Why don't you just cook the breakfast,
and try not to burn anything.

28
00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.909
- Yes, Aunt Petunia.
- I want everything to be perfect...

29
00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.009
...for my Dudley's special day!

30
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:10.310
- Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy.
- Yes, Uncle Vernon.

31
00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.610
Aren't they wonderful, darling?

32
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.209
- How many are there?
- 36. Counted them myself.

33
00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.609
36?! But last year... last year I had 37!

34
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.191
But some of them are quite a
bit bigger than last year's.

35
00:05:26.192 --> 00:05:27.709
I don't care how big they are!

36
00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.409
Oh, now, now, now. This is
what we're going to do...

37
00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:35.110
...is that when we go out, we're going to buy
you two new presents. How's that, pumpkin?

38
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:42.710
It should be a lovely day at the zoo.
I'm really looking forward to it.

39
00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.809
I'm warning you now, boy.

40
00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.409
Any funny business, any at all...

41
00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.810
...and you won't have
any meals for a week.

42
00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.310
Get in.

43
00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.910
Make it move.

44
00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.209
Move!

45
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.909
- Move!
- He's asleep!

46
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.710
He's boring.

47
00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.509
Sorry about him.

48
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:24.510
He doesn't understand
what it's like, lying there day after day...

49
00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.910
...watching people press
their ugly faces in on you.

50
00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:34.310
Can you hear me?

51
00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.910
It's just, I've never talked
to a snake before.

52
00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:42.709
Do you...?

53
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:47.110
I mean, do you talk to people often?

54
00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:51.409
You're from Burma, aren't you?
Was it nice there?

55
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:54.010
Do you miss your family?

56
00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:01.509
I see. That's me as well.
I never knew my parents either.

57
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:06.810
Mummy, Dad, come here! you won't believe
what this snake is doing!

58
00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:31.809
Thanks.

59
00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:33.610
Anytime.

60
00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:38.810
Snake!

61
00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:57.609
Mum! Mummy! Help me!

62
00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:01.010
My darling boy!
How did you get in there?

63
00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:06.610
Who did this? How did you get
in there? ls there a snake?

64
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:16.810
It's all right, sweetheart.
We'll get you out of these cold clothes.

65
00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:21.409
- What happened?
- I swear, I don't know!

66
00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:25.510
One minute the glass was there and
then it was gone, it was like magic.

67
00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:32.710
There's no such thing as magic.

68
00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:48.910
And smile!

69
00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:53.209
Vernon, just look at him!
I can't believe it!

70
00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:55.909
In just a week, he'll be off to Smeltings.

71
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:59.909
Caveat Smeltonia.
Proudest moment of my life.

72
00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:03.310
Will I have to wear that too?

73
00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.610
What? You? Go to Smeltings?

74
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:15.609
Don't be so stupid! You're going to go
to the state school. Where you belong.

75
00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:19.309
This is what you'll going to be wearing,
when I finish dyeing it.

76
00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:23.809
That's Dudley's old uniform.
It'll fit me like bits of old elephant skin.

77
00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:26.409
It'll fit you well enough.

78
00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:30.410
Go get the post. Go!

79
00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:02.909
Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk.

80
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:06.309
- Dad, look! Harry's got a letter!
- Hey, give it back! It's mine!

81
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:09.310
Yours? Who'd be writing to you?

82
00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:45.210
No more mail through this letterbox.

83
00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:59.710
Have a lovely day at the office, dear.

84
00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:05.210
Shoo! Go on.

85
00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:06.910
Fine day, Sunday.

86
00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:12.209
In my opinion, best day of the week.
Why is that, Dudley?

87
00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:16.809
- Because there's no post on Sundays?
- Right you are, Harry!

88
00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:19.910
No post on Sunday.

89
00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:25.210
No blasted letters today! No, sir.

90
00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:30.710
Not one single bloody letter. Not one!

91
00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:43.010
No, sir, not one blasted, miserable...

92
00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:56.710
Make it stop, please!

93
00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:00.510
Stop it!

94
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:07.510
Mummy, what's happening?

95
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:15.310
Give me that! Give me that letter!

96
00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:19.710
Get off!

97
00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:27.610
They're my letters! Let go of me!

98
00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:31.510
That's it! We're going away!

99
00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:35.709
Far away, where they can't find us!

100
00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:39.310
Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?

101
00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:16.510
Make a wish, Harry.

102
00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:34.610
Who's there?

103
00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:49.210
Sorry about that.

104
00:14:55.810 --> 00:15:00.710
I demand that you leave at once, Sir!
You are breaking and entering!

105
00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:06.410
Dry up, Dursley, you great prune.

106
00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:15.009
Mind, I haven't seen you
since you was a baby, Harry.

107
00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:19.809
But you're a bit more along than I would have
expected. Particularly 'round the middle.

108
00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:22.910
I'm not Harry.

109
00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:28.510
- I am.
- Well, of course you are.

110
00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:30.709
Got something for you.

111
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:36.610
Afraid I might have sat on it at somepoint,
but I imagine it'll taste fine just the same.

112
00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:42.510
Baked it myself, words and all.

113
00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:49.109
Thank you.

114
00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:53.510
It's not every day that your young man
turns 11, now is it?

115
00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:12.709
Excuse me, who are you?

116
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:17.909
Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys
and Grounds at Hogwarts.

117
00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:21.910
- Of course, you know all about Hogwarts.
- Sorry, no.

118
00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:27.409
No? Blimey, Harry, didn't you ever wonder where
your mum and dad learned it all?

119
00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:29.009
Learnt what?

120
00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:31.810
You're a wizard, Harry.

121
00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:35.009
- I'm a what?
- A wizard.

122
00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:38.309
And a thumping good one, I'd wager,
once you're trained up little.

123
00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:41.409
No, you've made a mistake.
I mean...

124
00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:44.710
...l can't be a wizard.

125
00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:50.110
I mean, I'm just Harry. Just Harry.

126
00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:55.109
Well, Just Harry, did you ever
make anything happen?

127
00:16:55.110 --> 00:17:00.010
Anything you couldn't explain,
when you were angry or scared?

128
00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:19.509
"Dear Mr. Potter,
We are pleased to inform you...

129
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:22.909
...that you have been accepted at
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."

130
00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:28.109
He will not be going there! We swore when we
took him in we'd put a stop to all this rubbish.

131
00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:32.509
You knew? You knew all along
and you never told me?

132
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:35.809
Of course we knew.
How could you not be?

133
00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:39.709
My perfect sister being who she was.

134
00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:45.909
My mother and father were so proud
the day she got her letter.

135
00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:50.309
"We have a witch in the family.
Isn't it wonderful?"

136
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:54.209
I was the only one to see her
for what she was.

137
00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:56.109
A freak!

138
00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:59.309
Then she met that Potter,
and then she had you...

139
00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:05.209
...and I knew you would be the same.
Just as strange, just as abnormal.

140
00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:10.409
And then, if you please, she went and got
herself blown up! And we got landed with you.

141
00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:14.709
Blown up? You told me
my parents died in a car crash.

142
00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:19.209
A car crash? A car crash killed
Lily and James Potter?

143
00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:23.309
- We had to say something.
- It's an outrage! It's a scandal!

144
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:26.009
He'll not be going.

145
00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:29.509
Oh, and I suppose a great Muggle like yourself's
going to stop him, are you?

146
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:30.810
Muggle?

147
00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:35.109
Non-magic folk. This boy's had
his name down ever since he were born.

148
00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:39.209
He's going to the finest school
of witchcraft and wizardry in the world and...

149
00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:45.309
...he'll be under the finest headmaster that
Hogwarts has ever seen, Albus Dumbledore.

150
00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:50.309
I will not pay to have some crackpot
old fool teach him magic tricks.

151
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:55.109
Never insult Albus Dumbledore...

152
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:57.410
...in front of me.

153
00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:20.509
Oh, um, I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell
anyone at Hogwarts about that.

154
00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:24.910
- Strickly speaking, I'm not allowed to do magic.
- Okay.

155
00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:29.210
Ooh, We're a bit behind schedule.
Best be off.

156
00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:38.610
Unless you'd rather stay, of course.

157
00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:56.510
"First year's students will require
three sets of plain work robes...

158
00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:58.509
...one wand."

159
00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:01.809
Essential bit of equipment, Harry.

160
00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:06.809
"One pair of dragon hide gloves."
Hagrid, Do they mean from a real dragon?

161
00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:10.310
They don't mean a penguin, do they?

162
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:15.510
- Crikey. I'd love a dragon.
- You'd like a dragon?

163
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:21.610
Vastly misunderstood beasts, Harry.
Vastly misunderstood.

164
00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:30.809
"All students must be equipped with...

165
00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:34.009
...one standard size 2
pewter cauldron...

166
00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:40.009
...and may bring, if they desire,
either an owl, a cat or a toad."

167
00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:42.809
Can we find all this in London?

168
00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:45.510
If you know where to go.

169
00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:11.109
Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?

170
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:15.209
No, thanks, Tom.
I'm on official Hogwarts business.

171
00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:18.609
Just helping young Harry here
buy his school supplies.

172
00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:22.410
Bless my soul.
It's Harry Potter!

173
00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:30.109
Welcome back, Mr. Potter.
Welcome back.

174
00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:34.710
Doris Crockford, Mr Potter.
I can't believe I'm meeting you at last.

175
00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:40.309
Harry Potter. Can't tell you
how pleased I am to meet you.

176
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:43.109
Hello, professor. I didn't see you there.

177
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:48.309
Harry, This is Professor Quirrell. He will be your
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts.

178
00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:51.009
Oh, nice to meet you.

179
00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:54.209
Fearfully fascinating subject.

180
00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:59.210
Not that you need it, eh, Potter?

181
00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:04.209
Yes, well, must be going now.
Lots to buy.

182
00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:06.210
Goodbye.

183
00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:12.409
- See, Harry? You're famous.
- But why am I famous, Hagrid?

184
00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:16.109
All those people back there,
how is it they know who I am?

185
00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:20.210
I'm not sure I'm exactly the right person
to tell you that, Harry.

186
00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:41.010
Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.

187
00:22:57.010 --> 00:22:59.809
Here's where you'll get your quills and your ink.

188
00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:04.010
And over there, all your bits and bobs
for doing your wizardry.

189
00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:31.009
It's a world-class racing broom.

190
00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:35.209
Look at it! The new Nimbus 2000!

191
00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:38.710
It's the fastest model yet.

192
00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:47.009
But, Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this?
I haven't any money.

193
00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:50.609
Well there's your money, Harry.
Gringotts, the wizard bank.

194
00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:56.310
Tain't no safer place, not one.
Except perhaps Hogwarts.

195
00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:12.909
Hagrid, what exactly
are these things?

196
00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:18.409
They're goblins, Harry. Clever as they come
goblins but not the most friendly of beasts.

197
00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:20.610
Best stay close.

198
00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:28.310
Mr. Harry Potter wishes
to make a withdrawal.

199
00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:35.710
And does Mr. Harry Potter
have his key?

200
00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:39.910
Oh, Wait a minute.
Got it here somewhere.

201
00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:45.509
Ha! Here's the little devil.

202
00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:48.710
Oh, and there's something else as well.

203
00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:53.210
Professor Dumbledore gave me this.

204
00:24:57.010 --> 00:25:02.410
It's about You-Know-What
in vault you-know-which.

205
00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:05.610
Very well.

206
00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:13.710
Vault 687.

207
00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:17.910
Lamp, please.

208
00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:27.710
Key, please.

209
00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:54.910
Didn't think your mum and dad
will leave you with nothing, now did ya?

210
00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:59.809
- Vault 713.
- What's in there, Hagrid?

211
00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:04.209
Can't tell you, Harry.
Hogwarts business. Very secret.

212
00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:06.110
Stand back.

213
00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:37.210
Best not to mention this to anyone, Harry.

214
00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:49.409
I still need... a wand.

215
00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:53.110
A wand? Well, you'll want Ollivanders.
There ain't no place better.

216
00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:59.010
Why don't you run along there and wait. I just
got one more thing I gotta do. Won't be long.

217
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:18.810
Hello?

218
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:23.610
Hello?

219
00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:31.410
I wondered when
I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter.

220
00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:41.409
It seems only yesterday...

221
00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:47.510
...that your mother and father were
in here buying their first wands.

222
00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:56.510
Here we are.

223
00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:07.610
Give it a wave.

224
00:28:13.810 --> 00:28:16.610
Apparently not.

225
00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:26.310
Perhaps...

226
00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:30.110
...this.

227
00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:41.710
No, no, definitely not.
No matter.

228
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:50.610
I wonder...

229
00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:22.009
Curious.

230
00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:25.109
Very curious.

231
00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:28.510
Sorry, but what's curious?

232
00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:33.509
I remember every wand
I've ever sold, Mr. Potter.

233
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:36.409
It so happens that the phoenix...

234
00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:41.510
...whose tail feather resides
in your wand, gave another feather.

235
00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:44.809
Just one other.

236
00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:49.409
It is curious that you should
be destined for this wand...

237
00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:55.410
...when its brother
gave you that scar.

238
00:29:57.010 --> 00:30:00.510
And who owned that wand?

239
00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:03.710
We do not speak his name.

240
00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:07.609
The wand chooses
the wizard, Mr. Potter.

241
00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:10.910
It's not always clear why.

242
00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:14.709
But I think it is clear...

243
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:18.809
...that we can expect
great things from you.

244
00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:23.309
After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named...

245
00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:26.209
...did great things.

246
00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:28.510
Terrible...

247
00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:32.210
...yes, but great.

248
00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:39.910
Harry! Harry!

249
00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:42.610
Happy birthday.

250
00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:53.310
You all right, Harry?
You seem very quiet.

251
00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:59.109
He killed my parents, didn't he?
The one who gave me this.

252
00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:03.110
You know, Hagrid. I know you do.

253
00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:11.409
First, and understand this Harry
because it's very important:

254
00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:14.209
Not all wizards are good.

255
00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:16.909
Some of them go bad.
A few years ago...

256
00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:22.109
...there was a one wizard who went as bad
as he can go. His name was V...

257
00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:25.909
- His name was V...
- Maybe if you wrote it down?

258
00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:28.009
No, I can't spell it.

259
00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:32.510
- All right, Voldemort.
- Voldemort?

260
00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:38.810
It was dark times, Harry. Dark times.

261
00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:44.209
Voldemort started
to gather some followers.

262
00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:47.810
Brought them over to the Dark Side.

263
00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:52.310
Anyone that stood up to him
ended up dead.

264
00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:56.409
Your parents fought against him.

265
00:31:56.410 --> 00:32:00.510
But nobody lived once
he decided to kill them.

266
00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:07.309
Nobody, not one.

267
00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:10.010
Except you.

268
00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:16.110
Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?

269
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:20.809
Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut
on your forehead, Harry.

270
00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:26.709
A mark like that only comes from being
touched by a curse, and an evil curse at that.

271
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:30.710
What happened to V...?
To You-Know-Who?

272
00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:35.109
Well, some say he died.

273
00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:37.709
Codswallop, in my opinion.

274
00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:41.209
Nope, I reckon he's out there still...

275
00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:44.309
...too tired to carry on.

276
00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:50.009
But one thing's absolutely certain. Something
about you stumped him that night.

277
00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:54.510
That's why you're famous.
That's why everybody knows your name.

278
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:58.710
You're the boy who lived.

279
00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:10.710
What are you looking at?

280
00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:14.409
Blimey, is that the time?

281
00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:18.609
Sorry, Harry, I'm gonna have to leave you.
Dumbledore will be wanting his...

282
00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:23.709
Well, he'll be wanting to see me.
Now, uh, your train leaves in 10 minutes.

283
00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:29.310
Here's your ticket. Stick to it, Harry
that's very important. Stick to your ticket.

284
00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:34.409
Platform 9 3/4?

285
00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:39.409
But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake.
This says platform 9 3/4.

286
00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:43.010
There's no such thing, is there?

287
00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:03.110
Sorry.

288
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:07.309
Excuse me. Excuse me.

289
00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:09.109
Right on your left Madam.

290
00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:13.109
Excuse me Sir, Can you tell me where
I might find platform 9 3/4?

291
00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:15.809
9 3/4? Think you're being funny, do ya?

292
00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:19.510
It's the same every year,
packed with Muggles, Of course. Come on!

293
00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:23.310
- Muggles?
- Platform 9 3/4, this way.

294
00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:32.110
All right, Percy, you first.

295
00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:43.209
Fred, you next.

296
00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:47.209
- He's not Fred, I am.
- Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother?

297
00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:49.410
Oh, I'm sorry, George.

298
00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:56.010
I'm only joking. I am Fred.

299
00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:04.310
Excuse me.

300
00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:08.109
Could you tell me how to...?

301
00:35:08.110 --> 00:35:11.909
How to get onto the platform?
Not to worry, dear.

302
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:14.609
It's Ron's first time
to Hogwarts as well.

303
00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:20.709
All you've got do is walk straight at the wall
between platforms 9 and 10.

304
00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:24.510
- Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous.
- Good luck.

305
00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:26.209
Excuse me. Do you mind?
Everywhere else is full.

306
00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:28.710
Not at all.

307
00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:34.209
I'm Ron, by the way.
Ron Weasley.

308
00:36:34.210 --> 00:36:37.110
I'm Harry. Harry Potter.

309
00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:40.409
So it's true!

310
00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:43.510
I mean, do you really have the...?

311
00:36:43.810 --> 00:36:47.010
- The what?
- The scar?

312
00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:52.410
Wicked!

313
00:36:54.510 --> 00:37:00.010
- Anything off the trolley, dears?
- No, thanks. I'm all set.

314
00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:06.310
We'll take the lot.

315
00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:21.910
- Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans?
- They mean every flavor.

316
00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:25.609
There's chocolate
and peppermint and there's also...

317
00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:29.609
...spinach, liver and tripe.

318
00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:34.110
George sweared he got
a bogey-flavoured one once!

319
00:37:38.410 --> 00:37:40.489
These aren't real
frogs, are they?

320
00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:44.009
It's just a spell. Besides,
It's the cards you want.

321
00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:49.810
Each pack's got a famous witch
or wizard. I've got about 500 meself.

322
00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:53.610
Watch it!

323
00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:59.510
Oh, that's rotten luck. They've only
got one good jump in them to begin with.

324
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:06.110
- I've got Dumbledore!
- I got about six of him.

325
00:38:07.610 --> 00:38:09.409
Hey, he's gone!

326
00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:13.110
Well, you can't expect him to
hang around all day, can you?

327
00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:16.809
This is Scabbers, by the way.
Pathetic, isn't he?

328
00:38:16.810 --> 00:38:18.209
Just a little bit.

329
00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:21.709
Fred gave me a spell as
to turn him yellow. Want to see?

330
00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:24.110
Yeah.

331
00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:32.410
Has anyone seen a toad?

332
00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:35.510
- A boy named Neville's lost one.
- No.

333
00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:40.410
Oh, are you doing magic?
Let's see, then.

334
00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:45.709
Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow.

335
00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:49.110
Turn this stupid fat rat yellow.

336
00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:57.409
Are you sure that's a real spell?
Well, it's not very good, is it?

337
00:38:57.410 --> 00:39:00.909
Of course, I've only tried
a few simple ones myself...

338
00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:03.810
...but they've all worked for me.

339
00:39:07.110 --> 00:39:09.510
For example:

340
00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:12.610
Oculus Reparo.

341
00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:17.310
That's better, isn't it?

342
00:39:18.210 --> 00:39:22.409
Holy cricket, you're Harry Potter!

343
00:39:22.410 --> 00:39:26.210
I'm Hermione Granger.
And you are...?

344
00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:30.109
- I'm Ron Weasley.
- Pleasure.

345
00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:35.510
You two better change into robes.
I expect we'll be arriving soon.

346
00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:43.009
You've got dirt on your nose, by the way.
Did you know?

347
00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:45.210
Just there.

348
00:39:57.210 --> 00:40:01.309
Right, then.
First years, this way, please!

349
00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:06.810
Come on, now, first years, don't be shy.
Come on now, hurry up.

350
00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:16.710
- Hello, Harry.
- Hey, Hagrid.

351
00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:22.210
Right, then. This way to the boats.
Come on, now, follow me.

352
00:41:07.610 --> 00:41:09.710
Wicked.

353
00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:40.009
Welcome to Hogwarts.

354
00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:44.209
Now, in a few moments, you'll pass through
these doors and join your classmates.

355
00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:49.409
But before you can take your seats,
you must be sorted into your houses.

356
00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:52.809
They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff...

357
00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:57.510
...Ravenclaw and Slytherin.

358
00:41:57.710 --> 00:42:03.010
Now, while you're here, your house
will be like your family.

359
00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:07.009
Your triumphs will earn you points.

360
00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:11.409
Any rule-breaking,
and you will lose points.

361
00:42:11.410 --> 00:42:17.009
At the end of the year, the house
with the most points is awarded the house cup.

362
00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:18.510
Trevor!

363
00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:29.009
Sorry.

364
00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:33.310
The Sorting Ceremony
will begin momentarily.

365
00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:37.910
It's true then,
what they're saying on the train.

366
00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:40.909
Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.

367
00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:42.610
Harry Potter?

368
00:42:42.910 --> 00:42:45.809
This is Crabbe, and Goyle.

369
00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:48.409
And I'm Malfoy.

370
00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:51.110
Draco Malfoy.

371
00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:56.509
Think my name's funny, do you?
I've no need to ask yours.

372
00:42:56.510 --> 00:43:02.610
Red hair and a hand-me-down robe?
You must be a Weasley.

373
00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:07.509
We'll soon find out that some wizarding families
are better than others, Potter.

374
00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:11.509
You don't want to go making friends
with the wrong sort.

375
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:14.010
I can help you there.

376
00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:20.010
I think I can tell the wrong sort
for myself, thanks.

377
00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:27.910
We're ready for you now.
Follow me.

378
00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:50.910
It's not real, the ceiling. It's just bewitched
to look like the night sky.

379
00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:54.210
I read about it
in Hogwarts: A History.

380
00:44:07.110 --> 00:44:10.310
All right, will you wait along here, please?

381
00:44:11.410 --> 00:44:14.409
Now, before we begin...

382
00:44:14.410 --> 00:44:17.809
...Professor Dumbledore would like
to say a few words.

383
00:44:17.810 --> 00:44:22.910
I have a few start-of-term notices
I wish to announce.

384
00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:25.409
The first years, please note...

385
00:44:25.410 --> 00:44:31.709
...that the Dark Forest is
strictly forbidden to all students.

386
00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:37.409
Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch,
has asked me to remind you...

387
00:44:37.410 --> 00:44:42.309
...that the third-floor corridor on the
right hand side is out of bounds...

388
00:44:42.310 --> 00:44:46.910
...to everyone who does not wish
to die a most painful death.

389
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:50.210
Thank you.

390
00:44:51.610 --> 00:44:55.909
When I call your name,
you will come forth.

391
00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:59.809
I shall place the Sorting Hat
on your head...

392
00:44:59.810 --> 00:45:03.209
...and you will be sorted
into your houses.

393
00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:06.110
Hermione Granger.

394
00:45:08.110 --> 00:45:11.010
Oh, no. Okay, relax.

395
00:45:11.110 --> 00:45:14.710
Mental, that one, I'm telling you.

396
00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:24.009
Ah, right then... hmm... right.

397
00:45:24.010 --> 00:45:27.910
Okay. Gryffindor!

398
00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:39.510
Draco Malfoy.

399
00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:46.310
Slytherin!

400
00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:50.009
There isn't a witch or wizard who went bad
who wasn't in Slytherin.

401
00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:52.910
Susan Bones.

402
00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:03.509
Harry, what is it?

403
00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:06.509
Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine.

404
00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:08.109
Let's see...

405
00:46:08.110 --> 00:46:12.810
I know! Hufflepuff!

406
00:46:14.210 --> 00:46:16.910
Ronald Weasley.

407
00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:35.810
Another Weasley!
I know just what to do with you.

408
00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:38.810
Gryffindor!

409
00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:47.510
Harry Potter.

410
00:47:05.310 --> 00:47:08.509
Hmm... difficult, very difficult.

411
00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:12.609
Plenty of courage, I see.
Not a bad mind, either.

412
00:47:12.610 --> 00:47:15.209
There's talent, oh, yes.

413
00:47:15.210 --> 00:47:19.209
And a thirst to prove yourself.

414
00:47:19.210 --> 00:47:21.710
But where to put you?

415
00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:24.709
Not Slytherin, not Slytherin!

416
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:28.609
Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure?

417
00:47:28.610 --> 00:47:33.609
You could be great, you know.
It's all here, in your head.

418
00:47:33.610 --> 00:47:39.309
And Slytherin will help you on the way
to greatnesses, no doubt about that.

419
00:47:39.310 --> 00:47:44.209
No? Well, if you're sure.

420
00:47:44.210 --> 00:47:46.109
Better be...

421
00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:48.410
...Gryffindor!

422
00:48:13.610 --> 00:48:16.710
Your attention, please.

423
00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:21.410
Let the feast begin.

424
00:48:38.110 --> 00:48:39.809
I'm half and half.

425
00:48:39.810 --> 00:48:43.309
Me dad's a Muggle. Mum's a witch.

426
00:48:43.310 --> 00:48:47.110
Bit of a nasty shock for him
when he found out.

427
00:48:47.810 --> 00:48:51.909
Say, Percy, who's that teacher
talking to Professor Quirrell?

428
00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:55.209
Oh, thats Professor Snape,
head of Slytherin house.

429
00:48:55.210 --> 00:48:57.409
- What's he teach?
- Potions.

430
00:48:57.410 --> 00:49:03.310
But everyone knows, its the Dark Arts he fancies.
He's been after Quirrell's job for years.

431
00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:10.109
Hello! How are you?

432
00:49:10.110 --> 00:49:13.710
Welcome to Gryffindor.

433
00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:26.310
Look, It's the Bloody Baron!

434
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:33.709
Hello, Sir Nicholas.
Have a nice summer?

435
00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:39.410
Dismal. Once again, my request to join
the Headless Hunt has been denied.

436
00:49:42.110 --> 00:49:45.309
I know you.
You're Nearly Headless Nick.

437
00:49:45.310 --> 00:49:48.209
I prefer Sir Nicholas,
if you don't mind.

438
00:49:48.210 --> 00:49:52.010
"Nearly" headless?
How can you be nearly headless?

439
00:49:52.110 --> 00:49:54.310
Like this.

440
00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:08.109
Gryffindors, follow me please.
Keep up. Thank you.

441
00:50:08.110 --> 00:50:12.709
Ravenclaw, follow me. This way.

442
00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:16.009
This is the most direct path
to the dormitories.

443
00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:20.710
Oh, and keep an eye on the staircases.
They like to change.

444
00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:35.509
Keep up, please, and follow me.
Quickly now, come on. Come on.

445
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:38.409
That picture's moving.

446
00:50:38.410 --> 00:50:42.210
- Look at that one.
- I think she fancies you.

447
00:50:43.610 --> 00:50:46.209
- Oh, look! Look!
- Who's that girl?

448
00:50:46.210 --> 00:50:49.110
Welcome to Hogwarts.

449
00:51:04.810 --> 00:51:06.710
Password?

450
00:51:06.810 --> 00:51:09.910
Caput Draconis.

451
00:51:16.410 --> 00:51:21.510
Follow me, everyone. Keep up.
Quickly, come on.

452
00:51:24.010 --> 00:51:26.710
Gather around here.

453
00:51:28.110 --> 00:51:31.609
Welcome to the Gryffindor common room.

454
00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:36.209
Boys' dormitory is upstairs and down to your left.
Girls, the same on your right.

455
00:51:36.210 --> 00:51:39.610
You'll find that your belongings have
already been brought up.

456
00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:49.409
Made it!

457
00:52:49.410 --> 00:52:54.110
Can you imagine the look on old
McGonagall's face if we were late?

458
00:52:57.010 --> 00:53:02.209
- That was bloody brilliant!
- Thank you for that assessment, Mr Weasley.

459
00:53:02.210 --> 00:53:04.684
Perhaps, lt'd be more useful
if I were to transfigure

460
00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:06.709
Mr. Potter and yourself
into a pocket-watch.

461
00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:10.109
- That way, one of you might be on time.
- We got lost.

462
00:53:10.110 --> 00:53:16.210
Then perhaps a map? I trust you
don't need one to find your seats.

463
00:53:24.110 --> 00:53:30.009
There will be no foolish wand-waving
or silly incantations in this class.

464
00:53:30.010 --> 00:53:33.809
As such, I don't expect
many of you to appreciate...

465
00:53:33.810 --> 00:53:37.809
...the subtle science and exact art
that is potion-making.

466
00:53:37.810 --> 00:53:41.110
However, for those select few...

467
00:53:41.810 --> 00:53:45.410
...who possess the predisposition...

468
00:53:48.810 --> 00:53:52.209
...l can teach you
how to bewitch the mind...

469
00:53:52.210 --> 00:53:55.409
...and ensnare the senses.

470
00:53:55.410 --> 00:53:58.209
I can tell you how to bottle fame...

471
00:53:58.210 --> 00:54:04.410
...brew glory and even
put a stopper in death.

472
00:54:08.110 --> 00:54:13.209
Then again, maybe some of you have
come to Hogwarts in...

473
00:54:13.210 --> 00:54:19.409
...possession of abilities so formidable that
you feel confident enough...

474
00:54:19.410 --> 00:54:22.610
...to not pay attention.

475
00:54:28.310 --> 00:54:31.210
Mr. Potter.

476
00:54:32.110 --> 00:54:36.210
Our new celebrity.

477
00:54:38.110 --> 00:54:44.210
Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root
of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?

478
00:54:47.210 --> 00:54:49.809
You don't know? Well, let's try again.

479
00:54:49.810 --> 00:54:54.710
Where, Mr Potter, would you look
if I asked you to find me a bezoar?

480
00:54:55.710 --> 00:54:57.409
I don't know, Sir.

481
00:54:57.410 --> 00:55:01.510
And what is the difference
between monkshood and wolfsbane?

482
00:55:03.810 --> 00:55:06.310
I don't know, Sir.

483
00:55:07.110 --> 00:55:08.710
Pity.

484
00:55:10.110 --> 00:55:14.610
Clearly, fame isn't everything...

485
00:55:15.010 --> 00:55:17.209
...is it, Mr. Potter?

486
00:55:17.210 --> 00:55:22.410
Clearly, Hermione knows.
Seems a pity not to ask her.

487
00:55:22.810 --> 00:55:25.710
Silence.

488
00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:38.810
Put your hand down,
you silly girl!

489
00:55:41.710 --> 00:55:44.709
For your information, Potter...

490
00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:47.379
...asphodel and wormwood
make a sleeping potion so

491
00:55:47.405 --> 00:55:50.309
powerful it is known as the
Draught of the Living Dead.

492
00:55:50.310 --> 00:55:55.909
A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of
a goat and it will save you from most poisons.

493
00:55:55.910 --> 00:56:02.810
As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same
plant, which also goes by the name of aconite.

494
00:56:04.010 --> 00:56:06.610
Well...

495
00:56:06.810 --> 00:56:12.010
...why aren't you all
copying this down?

496
00:56:19.610 --> 00:56:22.309
And Gryffindors...

497
00:56:22.310 --> 00:56:26.809
...note that five points will
be taken from your house...

498
00:56:26.810 --> 00:56:29.410
...for your classmate's cheek.

499
00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:52.510
Eye of rabbit, harp string hum
Turn this water into rum.

500
00:56:53.410 --> 00:56:55.210
Eye of rabbit...

501
00:56:55.310 --> 00:56:58.209
What's Seamus trying to do
to that glass of water?

502
00:56:58.210 --> 00:57:03.210
Turn it into rum. Actually managed
a weak tea yesterday, before...

503
00:57:09.610 --> 00:57:11.810
Mail's here.

504
00:57:43.810 --> 00:57:47.110
Can I borrow this? Thanks.

505
00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:53.109
Hey, look! Neville's got a Remembrall.

506
00:57:53.110 --> 00:57:58.910
I've read about those. When the smoke turns
red, it means you've forgotten something.

507
00:57:59.010 --> 00:58:02.609
The only problem is, I can't remember
what I've forgotten.

508
00:58:02.610 --> 00:58:06.309
Hey Ron! Somebody broke into Gringotts.
Listen.

509
00:58:06.310 --> 00:58:10.209
"Believed to be the work
of Dark wizards or witches unknown...

510
00:58:10.210 --> 00:58:16.109
...Gringotts goblins while acknowledging
the breach, insist nothing was taken.

511
00:58:16.110 --> 00:58:22.009
The vault in question, number 713, had, in fact,
been emptied earlier that very same day."

512
00:58:22.010 --> 00:58:26.610
That's odd. That's the vault
Hagrid and I went to.

513
00:58:35.210 --> 00:58:39.209
- Good afternoon, class.
- Good afternoon, Madam Hooch.

514
00:58:39.210 --> 00:58:42.310
Good afternoon, Amanda.
Good afternoon.

515
00:58:43.310 --> 00:58:45.909
Welcome to your first flying lesson.

516
00:58:45.910 --> 00:58:50.109
Well, what are you waiting for? Everyone step
up to the left side of their broomstick.

517
00:58:50.110 --> 00:58:55.909
Come on now, hurry up. Stick your right hand
over the broom and say, "Up."

518
00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:58.109
Up!

519
00:58:58.110 --> 00:58:59.310
Up.

520
00:59:00.510 --> 00:59:02.610
Up.

521
00:59:04.010 --> 00:59:05.909
Up. Up!

522
00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:08.210
With feeling.

523
00:59:16.510 --> 00:59:18.909
Shut up, Harry.

524
00:59:18.910 --> 00:59:23.709
Now, once you've got hold of
your broom, I want you to mount it.

525
00:59:23.710 --> 00:59:28.010
And grip it tight, you don't wanna be
sliding off the end.

526
00:59:28.110 --> 00:59:33.309
When I blow my whistle, I want each of you
to kick off from the ground, hard.

527
00:59:33.310 --> 00:59:37.309
Keep your broom steady,
hover for a moment...

528
00:59:37.310 --> 00:59:41.909
...then lean forward slightly
and touch back down.

529
00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:45.310
On my whistle. Three, two...

530
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:49.110
Mr. Longbottom.

531
00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:56.509
- Mr. Longbottom!
- Down, down!

532
00:59:56.510 --> 00:59:58.110
Neville!

533
01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:04.510
Come back down this instant!

534
01:00:33.110 --> 01:00:35.810
Everyone out of the way!

535
01:00:41.110 --> 01:00:43.609
Is he all right?

536
01:00:43.610 --> 01:00:49.610
Oh, dear, it's a broken wrist.
Poor boy. Come on now, up you get.

537
01:00:50.610 --> 01:00:55.509
Everyone's to keep their feet firmly on the ground
while I take Mr Longbottom to the hospital wing.

538
01:00:55.510 --> 01:00:59.309
Understand? If I see
a single broom in the air...

539
01:00:59.310 --> 01:01:04.809
...the one riding it will find themselves out
of Hogwarts before they can say, Quidditch.

540
01:01:04.810 --> 01:01:06.909
Did you see his face?

541
01:01:06.910 --> 01:01:11.009
Maybe if the fat lump had given this a squeeze,
he'd have remembered to fall on his fat arse.

542
01:01:11.010 --> 01:01:13.810
Give it here, Malfoy.

543
01:01:14.310 --> 01:01:18.310
No. I think I'll leave it somewhere
for Longbottom to find.

544
01:01:22.210 --> 01:01:25.010
How about on the roof?

545
01:01:25.810 --> 01:01:30.010
What's the matter, Potter?
Bit beyond your reach?

546
01:01:32.210 --> 01:01:36.209
Harry, no way!
You heard what Madam Hooch said.

547
01:01:36.210 --> 01:01:39.409
Besides, you don't even know how to fly.

548
01:01:39.410 --> 01:01:41.610
What an idiot.

549
01:01:44.710 --> 01:01:48.509
Give it here or I'll
knock you off your broom!

550
01:01:48.510 --> 01:01:50.910
Is that so?

551
01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:56.310
Have it your way, then.

552
01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:32.609
- Nice going, Harry.
- That was wicked, Harry!

553
01:02:32.610 --> 01:02:34.910
Harry Potter!

554
01:02:35.610 --> 01:02:37.910
Follow me.

555
01:02:49.310 --> 01:02:51.810
You wait here.

556
01:02:53.310 --> 01:02:58.809
Professor Quirrell, excuse me.
Could I borrow Wood for a moment please?

557
01:02:58.810 --> 01:03:00.910
Oh, yes, of course.

558
01:03:06.310 --> 01:03:12.310
Potter, this is Oliver Wood.
Wood, I have found you a Seeker.

559
01:03:14.110 --> 01:03:17.909
Have you heard? Harry Potter's
the new Gryffindor Seeker.

560
01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:20.410
I always knew he'd do well.

561
01:03:20.510 --> 01:03:24.809
Seeker? But first years
never make their house teams.

562
01:03:24.810 --> 01:03:29.509
- You must be the youngest Quidditch player in...
- A century, according to McGonagall.

563
01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:32.309
Hey, well done, Harry.
Wood's just told us.

564
01:03:32.310 --> 01:03:35.109
Fred and George are on the team too.
Beaters.

565
01:03:35.110 --> 01:03:39.009
Our job is to make sure that you
don't get bloodied up too bad.

566
01:03:39.010 --> 01:03:41.909
Can't make any promises, of course.
Rough game, Quidditch.

567
01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:46.009
Brutal, But no one's died in years.
Someone will vanishes occasionally.

568
01:03:46.010 --> 01:03:49.009
But they'll turn up in a month or two.

569
01:03:49.010 --> 01:03:54.909
Oh, go on Harry. Quidditch is great. Best game
there is, and you'll be great too.

570
01:03:54.910 --> 01:03:58.410
But I've never even played Quidditch.
What if I make a fool of myself?

571
01:03:58.510 --> 01:04:03.610
You won't make a fool of yourself.
It's in your blood.

572
01:04:10.810 --> 01:04:16.010
Harry, you never told me your father
was a Seeker too.

573
01:04:16.510 --> 01:04:19.010
I didn't know.

574
01:04:23.210 --> 01:04:28.009
I'm telling you, it's spooky.
She knows more about you than you do.

575
01:04:28.010 --> 01:04:30.610
Who doesn't?

576
01:04:31.210 --> 01:04:33.609
What's happening?

577
01:04:33.610 --> 01:04:38.110
The staircases change, remember?

578
01:04:43.310 --> 01:04:48.010
- Let's go this way.
- Before the staircase moves again.

579
01:04:55.310 --> 01:04:59.009
Does anybody feel like
we shouldn't be here?

580
01:04:59.010 --> 01:05:01.309
We're not supposed to be here.

581
01:05:01.310 --> 01:05:05.610
This is the third floor.
It's forbidden.

582
01:05:06.410 --> 01:05:08.310
Let's go.

583
01:05:10.210 --> 01:05:13.410
- It's Filch's cat!
- Run!

584
01:05:16.910 --> 01:05:20.510
Quick, let's hide through that door!

585
01:05:25.410 --> 01:05:27.609
- It's locked!
- Thats it, We're done for!

586
01:05:27.610 --> 01:05:30.110
Oh, move over!

587
01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:33.210
Alohomora.

588
01:05:33.710 --> 01:05:36.010
Get in.

589
01:05:36.910 --> 01:05:38.209
Alohomora?

590
01:05:38.210 --> 01:05:41.009
Standard Book of Spells,
chapter seven.

591
01:05:41.010 --> 01:05:44.610
Anyone here, my sweet?

592
01:05:50.610 --> 01:05:51.910
Come on.

593
01:05:52.510 --> 01:05:55.209
- Filch is gone.
- Probably thinks this door's locked.

594
01:05:55.210 --> 01:05:59.110
- It was locked.
- And for good reason.

595
01:06:24.510 --> 01:06:30.209
What do they think they're doing? Keeping a thing
like that locked up in a school.

596
01:06:30.210 --> 01:06:34.109
You don't use your eyes, do you? Didn't you see
what it was standing on?

597
01:06:34.110 --> 01:06:38.409
I wasn't looking at its feet!
I was a bit preoccupied with its heads.

598
01:06:38.410 --> 01:06:41.509
Or maybe you didn't notice.
There were three!

599
01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:45.409
It was standing on a trap door.
Which means it wasn't there by accident.

600
01:06:45.410 --> 01:06:49.210
- It's guarding something.
- Guarding something?

601
01:06:49.410 --> 01:06:53.309
That's right. Now, if you two don't mind,
I'm going to bed...

602
01:06:53.310 --> 01:06:57.209
...before either of you come up with
another clever idea to get us killed.

603
01:06:57.210 --> 01:07:00.610
Or worse, expelled.

604
01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:08.110
She needs to sort out her priorities.

605
01:07:12.410 --> 01:07:16.909
Quidditch is easy enough to understand.
Each team has seven players.

606
01:07:16.910 --> 01:07:22.910
Three Chasers, two Beaters,
one Keeper and a Seeker. That's you.

607
01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:32.009
There are three kinds of balls.
This one's called the Quaffle.

608
01:07:32.010 --> 01:07:38.209
Now, the Chasers handle the Quaffle and try
to put it through one of those three hoops.

609
01:07:38.210 --> 01:07:42.709
The Keeper, that's me,
defends the hoops. With me so far?

610
01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:47.510
I think so. What are those?

611
01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:52.010
You better take this.

612
01:08:01.710 --> 01:08:04.810
Careful now, it's coming back.

613
01:08:11.110 --> 01:08:15.010
Not bad, Potter.
You'd make a fair Beater.

614
01:08:31.410 --> 01:08:34.010
What was that?

615
01:08:34.410 --> 01:08:38.409
Bludger. Nasty little buggers.

616
01:08:38.410 --> 01:08:42.210
But you are a Seeker.

617
01:08:45.510 --> 01:08:50.309
The only thing I want you
to worry about is this.

618
01:08:50.310 --> 01:08:53.009
The Golden Snitch.

619
01:08:53.010 --> 01:08:56.309
- I like this ball.
- You like it now.

620
01:08:56.310 --> 01:09:00.509
Just wait. It's wicked fast
and damn near impossible to see.

621
01:09:00.510 --> 01:09:02.609
What do I do with it?

622
01:09:02.610 --> 01:09:06.109
You catch it.
Before the other team's Seeker.

623
01:09:06.110 --> 01:09:08.809
You catch this, the game's over.

624
01:09:08.810 --> 01:09:13.010
You catch this, Potter,
and we win.

625
01:09:21.810 --> 01:09:27.309
One of a wizard's most rudimentary
skills is levitation...

626
01:09:27.310 --> 01:09:31.509
...or the ability to make objects fly.

627
01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:34.209
Do you have your feathers? Good.

628
01:09:34.210 --> 01:09:39.509
Now, don't forget the nice wrist
movement we've been practicing.

629
01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:43.210
The swish and flick. Everyone.

630
01:09:43.410 --> 01:09:49.410
The swish and flick. Good.
Oh, and enunciate.

631
01:09:49.710 --> 01:09:54.410
Wingardium Leviosa.
Off you go, then.

632
01:09:55.110 --> 01:09:57.909
Wingardium Leviosa.

633
01:09:57.910 --> 01:10:00.510
Wingardium Leviosa.

634
01:10:04.010 --> 01:10:08.509
No, stop, stop, stop! You're going
to take someone's eye out.

635
01:10:08.510 --> 01:10:14.810
Besides, you're saying it wrong.
It's Leviosa, not Leviosar.

636
01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:19.610
You do it then, if you're so clever.
Go on, go on.

637
01:10:20.510 --> 01:10:23.910
Wingardium Leviosa.

638
01:10:31.110 --> 01:10:37.009
Oh, well done! See here, everyone,
Miss Granger's done it!

639
01:10:37.010 --> 01:10:38.910
Splendid!

640
01:10:40.210 --> 01:10:42.710
Well done, dear.

641
01:10:46.710 --> 01:10:51.010
I think we're going to need
another feather over here, Professor.

642
01:10:57.210 --> 01:11:01.709
"It's Leviosa, not Leviosar."

643
01:11:01.710 --> 01:11:07.410
She's a nightmare, honestly!
No wonder she hasn't got any friends.

644
01:11:07.710 --> 01:11:10.610
I think she heard you.

645
01:11:38.910 --> 01:11:41.309
Where's Hermione?

646
01:11:41.310 --> 01:11:44.609
Parvati Patil said that she wouldn't
come out of the girl's bathroom.

647
01:11:44.610 --> 01:11:49.010
She said that she'd been in there
all afternoon, crying.

648
01:11:53.110 --> 01:11:57.009
Troll! In the dungeon!

649
01:11:57.010 --> 01:12:00.610
Troll in the dungeon!

650
01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:05.810
Thought you ought to know.

651
01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:15.510
Silence!

652
01:12:16.810 --> 01:12:21.110
Everyone will please not panic!

653
01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:23.309
Now...

654
01:12:23.310 --> 01:12:28.110
...prefects will lead their house
back to the dormitories.

655
01:12:28.510 --> 01:12:33.610
Teachers will follow me
to the dungeons.

656
01:12:44.410 --> 01:12:47.809
Gryffindors, keep up, please,
and stay alert.

657
01:12:47.810 --> 01:12:49.709
How could a troll get in?

658
01:12:49.710 --> 01:12:55.109
Not on its own. Trolls are really stupid.
Probably people playing jokes.

659
01:12:55.110 --> 01:12:59.410
- What?
- Hermione! She doesn't know.

660
01:13:11.210 --> 01:13:14.810
I think the troll's left the dungeon.

661
01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:20.810
It's going into the girl's bathroom.

662
01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:54.210
Hermione, move!

663
01:13:57.310 --> 01:14:01.710
Help! Help!

664
01:14:03.410 --> 01:14:05.810
Hey, pea brain!

665
01:14:17.910 --> 01:14:20.110
Help!

666
01:14:41.010 --> 01:14:43.610
Do something!

667
01:14:44.710 --> 01:14:49.010
- What?
- Anything!

668
01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:52.009
- Hurry up!
- Swish and flick.

669
01:14:52.010 --> 01:14:54.610
Wingardium Leviosa.

670
01:15:05.210 --> 01:15:07.510
Cool.

671
01:15:31.610 --> 01:15:34.709
Is it dead?

672
01:15:34.710 --> 01:15:38.910
I don't think so. Just knocked out.

673
01:15:44.910 --> 01:15:47.510
Troll bogies.

674
01:15:49.710 --> 01:15:53.509
Oh, my goodness!
Explain yourselves, both of you!

675
01:15:53.510 --> 01:15:58.410
- Well, what it is...
- It's my fault, Professor McGonagall.

676
01:16:00.310 --> 01:16:01.810
Miss Granger?

677
01:16:02.310 --> 01:16:07.609
I went looking for the troll.
I'd read about them and thought I could handle it.

678
01:16:07.610 --> 01:16:09.709
But I was wrong.

679
01:16:09.710 --> 01:16:15.110
If Harry and Ron hadn't come
and found me, I'd probably be dead.

680
01:16:15.810 --> 01:16:20.409
Be that as it may, it was
an extremely foolish thing to do.

681
01:16:20.410 --> 01:16:26.309
I would've expected more rational behavior on your
part and am very disappointed in you, Ms. Granger.

682
01:16:26.310 --> 01:16:29.509
Five points will be taken
from Gryffindor...

683
01:16:29.510 --> 01:16:33.410
...for your serious lack of judgment.

684
01:16:33.510 --> 01:16:35.709
As for you two gentlemen...

685
01:16:35.710 --> 01:16:39.409
...l just hope you realize
how fortunate you are.

686
01:16:39.410 --> 01:16:43.009
Not many first-year students
could take on a full grown mountain troll...

687
01:16:43.010 --> 01:16:45.909
...and live to tell the tale.

688
01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:48.610
Five points...

689
01:16:49.710 --> 01:16:53.110
...will be awarded to each of you...

690
01:16:54.410 --> 01:16:57.810
...for sheer dumb luck.

691
01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:07.110
Perhaps you ought to go.
It might wake up.

692
01:17:16.210 --> 01:17:20.810
- Good of you to get us out of trouble like that.
- Mind you, we did save her life.

693
01:17:21.010 --> 01:17:25.609
Mind you, she might not have needed saving
if you hadn't insulted her.

694
01:17:25.610 --> 01:17:29.210
What are friends for?

695
01:17:31.010 --> 01:17:34.009
Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on.

696
01:17:34.010 --> 01:17:37.409
Ron's right, Harry.
You're gonna need your strength today.

697
01:17:37.410 --> 01:17:39.910
I'm not hungry.

698
01:17:40.210 --> 01:17:46.009
Good luck today, Potter. Then again, now
that you've proven yourself against a troll.

699
01:17:46.010 --> 01:17:49.409
A little game of Quidditch
should be easy work for you.

700
01:17:49.410 --> 01:17:52.810
Even if it is against Slytherin.

701
01:18:00.210 --> 01:18:03.910
- That explains the blood.
- Blood?

702
01:18:04.010 --> 01:18:08.409
Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape let
the troll in as a diversion...

703
01:18:08.410 --> 01:18:11.209
...so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog.

704
01:18:11.210 --> 01:18:14.209
But, he got himself bitten,
that's why he's limping.

705
01:18:14.210 --> 01:18:16.810
But why would anyone go near that dog?

706
01:18:17.110 --> 01:18:20.609
The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took
something out of one of the vaults.

707
01:18:20.610 --> 01:18:24.009
He said it was Hogwarts business,
very secret.

708
01:18:24.010 --> 01:18:25.409
So you're saying...

709
01:18:25.410 --> 01:18:30.210
That's what the dog's guarding.
That's what Snape wants.

710
01:18:43.010 --> 01:18:47.310
- Bit early for mail, isn't it?
- But I never get mail.

711
01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:49.410
Let's open it.

712
01:18:59.210 --> 01:19:00.810
It's a broomstick.

713
01:19:01.310 --> 01:19:05.710
That's not just a broomstick, Harry,
it's a Nimbus 2000!

714
01:19:06.910 --> 01:19:09.210
But who...?

715
01:19:30.610 --> 01:19:33.309
- Scared, Harry?
- A little.

716
01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:37.209
That's all right. I felt the same way
before my first game.

717
01:19:37.210 --> 01:19:41.009
- What happened?
- Er, I don't really remember.

718
01:19:41.010 --> 01:19:43.809
I took a Bludger to the head
two minutes in.

719
01:19:43.810 --> 01:19:47.010
Woke up in the hospital a week later.

720
01:20:08.910 --> 01:20:12.409
Hello! Welcome to Hogwarts' first
Quidditch game of the season.

721
01:20:12.410 --> 01:20:17.510
Today's game,
Slytherin versus Gryffindor!

722
01:20:47.410 --> 01:20:50.109
The players take their positions
as madam Hooch...

723
01:20:50.110 --> 01:20:54.109
...steps out onto
the field to begin the game!

724
01:20:54.110 --> 01:20:57.710
Now, I want a nice, clean game...

725
01:20:58.110 --> 01:21:00.810
...from all of you!

726
01:21:05.610 --> 01:21:08.809
The Bludgers are up,
followed by the Golden Snitch.

727
01:21:08.810 --> 01:21:11.709
Remember, the Snitch
is worth 150 points.

728
01:21:11.710 --> 01:21:15.810
The Seeker who catches the Snitch
ends the game.

729
01:21:21.610 --> 01:21:26.010
The Quaffle is released
and the game begins!

730
01:21:44.410 --> 01:21:49.510
Angelina Johnson scores!
Ten points for Gryffindor!

731
01:21:54.410 --> 01:21:56.010
Well done!

732
01:22:00.110 --> 01:22:06.110
Slytherin takes possession of the Quaffle.
Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.

733
01:22:37.810 --> 01:22:40.910
Another 10 points to Gryffindor!

734
01:22:54.410 --> 01:22:56.610
Give me that!

735
01:23:27.710 --> 01:23:30.710
Take that side!

736
01:24:19.810 --> 01:24:23.410
What's going on
with Harry's broomstick?

737
01:24:32.010 --> 01:24:34.409
It's Snape.
He's jinxing the broom!

738
01:24:34.410 --> 01:24:39.110
- Jinxing the broom? What do we do?
- Leave it to me.

739
01:25:00.610 --> 01:25:02.410
Come on, Hermione!

740
01:25:16.210 --> 01:25:20.310
Lacarnum lnflamarae.

741
01:25:27.010 --> 01:25:30.410
Fire! You're on fire!

742
01:25:48.010 --> 01:25:50.410
Go, go, go, go!

743
01:26:42.110 --> 01:26:44.810
Looks like he's gonna be sick.

744
01:26:45.610 --> 01:26:47.209
He's got the Snitch!

745
01:26:47.210 --> 01:26:51.509
Harry Potter receives 150 points
for catching the Snitch!

746
01:26:51.510 --> 01:26:53.510
Gryffindor wins!

747
01:27:36.810 --> 01:27:41.209
Nonsense! Why would Snape
put a curse on Harry's broom?

748
01:27:41.210 --> 01:27:45.409
Who knows? Why was he trying
to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween?

749
01:27:45.410 --> 01:27:48.009
- Who told you about Fluffy?
- Fluffy?

750
01:27:48.010 --> 01:27:51.909
- That thing has a name?
- Of course he's got a name. He's mine.

751
01:27:51.910 --> 01:27:54.505
I bought him off an lrish feller
I met down at the pub last year.

752
01:27:54.506 --> 01:27:56.361
Then I lent him to
Dumbledore to guard the...

753
01:27:56.362 --> 01:27:57.062
Yes?

754
01:27:57.135 --> 01:27:59.085
Shouldn't have said that.
No more questions!

755
01:27:59.086 --> 01:28:02.335
Don't ask any more questions.
That's top-secret, that is.

756
01:28:02.410 --> 01:28:06.609
But Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding,
Snape's trying to steal it.

757
01:28:06.810 --> 01:28:10.510
Codswallop. Professor Snape
is a Hogwarts teacher.

758
01:28:10.710 --> 01:28:16.009
Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a spell when
I see one. I've read all about them.

759
01:28:16.010 --> 01:28:19.809
You've got to keep eye contact,
and Snape wasn't blinking.

760
01:28:19.810 --> 01:28:22.410
Exactly.

761
01:28:22.710 --> 01:28:25.709
Now, you listen to me,
all three of you.

762
01:28:25.710 --> 01:28:30.609
You're meddling in things that ought
not to be meddled in. It's dangerous.

763
01:28:30.610 --> 01:28:35.909
What that dog is guarding is strictly
between Prof. Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.

764
01:28:35.910 --> 01:28:37.610
Nicholas Flamel?

765
01:28:38.310 --> 01:28:43.209
I shouldn't have said that.
I should not have said that.

766
01:28:43.210 --> 01:28:47.509
Nicholas Flamel.
Who's Nicholas Flamel?

767
01:28:47.510 --> 01:28:49.810
I don't know.

768
01:29:08.410 --> 01:29:11.409
Merry Christmas Merry Christmas.

769
01:29:11.410 --> 01:29:14.409
Ring the Hogwart bell.

770
01:29:14.410 --> 01:29:17.409
Merry Christmas Merry Christmas.

771
01:29:17.410 --> 01:29:20.710
Cast a Christmas spell.

772
01:29:34.010 --> 01:29:37.610
Knight to e5.

773
01:29:45.010 --> 01:29:47.510
Queen to e5.

774
01:29:52.810 --> 01:29:54.510
That's totally barbaric!

775
01:29:54.810 --> 01:29:58.609
That's wizard's chess.
I see you've packed.

776
01:29:58.610 --> 01:30:00.310
I see you haven't.

777
01:30:00.410 --> 01:30:05.809
Change of plans. My parents decided to go
to Romania to visit my brother, Charlie.

778
01:30:05.810 --> 01:30:09.809
- He's studying dragons there.
- Good. You can help Harry, then.

779
01:30:09.810 --> 01:30:13.409
He's going to go and look in the library
for information on Nicholas Flamel.

780
01:30:13.410 --> 01:30:17.210
We've looked a hundred times!

781
01:30:17.510 --> 01:30:23.110
Not in the restricted section.
Happy Christmas.

782
01:30:25.010 --> 01:30:28.210
I think we've had
a bad influence on her.

783
01:30:30.410 --> 01:30:35.110
Harry, wake up!
Come on, Harry, wake up!

784
01:30:44.610 --> 01:30:48.209
- Happy Christmas, Harry.
- Happy Christmas, Ron.

785
01:30:48.210 --> 01:30:50.710
What are you wearing?

786
01:30:51.010 --> 01:30:55.010
Oh, my mum made it.
Looks like you've got one too.

787
01:30:55.810 --> 01:30:58.510
- I've got presents?
- Yeah.

788
01:31:05.610 --> 01:31:08.010
There they are.

789
01:31:18.810 --> 01:31:22.509
"Your father left this
in my possession before he died.

790
01:31:22.510 --> 01:31:26.910
It is time it was returned to you.
Use it well."

791
01:31:43.410 --> 01:31:47.409
- What is it?
- Some kind of cloak.

792
01:31:47.410 --> 01:31:50.710
Well, let's see, then. Put it on.

793
01:31:55.810 --> 01:31:57.309
My body's gone!

794
01:31:57.310 --> 01:32:01.210
I know what that is.
That's an invisibility cloak!

795
01:32:01.410 --> 01:32:03.610
I'm invisible?

796
01:32:03.810 --> 01:32:08.510
They're really rare.
I wonder who gave it to you.

797
01:32:08.710 --> 01:32:13.810
There was no name.
It just said, "Use it well."

798
01:32:41.510 --> 01:32:47.609
Famous Fire-Eaters.
Fifteenth-Century Fiends.

799
01:32:47.610 --> 01:32:53.810
Flamel. Nicholas Flamel.
Where are you?

800
01:33:12.310 --> 01:33:14.510
Who's there?

801
01:33:20.310 --> 01:33:26.310
I know you're in there.
You can't hide.

802
01:33:33.310 --> 01:33:37.410
Who is it? Show yourself.

803
01:34:24.310 --> 01:34:25.910
Severus, I...

804
01:34:26.310 --> 01:34:30.409
You don't want me
as your enemy, Quirrell.

805
01:34:30.410 --> 01:34:35.410
- I don't know what you mean.
- You know perfectly well what I mean.

806
01:34:52.310 --> 01:34:55.809
We'll have another little chat soon.

807
01:34:55.810 --> 01:35:01.509
When you've had time to decide
where your loyalties lie.

808
01:35:01.510 --> 01:35:06.210
Professors. I found this
in the restricted section.

809
01:35:06.410 --> 01:35:11.810
It's still hot. That means
there's a student out of bed.

810
01:36:43.610 --> 01:36:45.710
Mum?

811
01:36:48.610 --> 01:36:50.910
Dad?

812
01:37:25.410 --> 01:37:30.710
Ron, you've really gotta see this!
Ron, you've gotta see this!

813
01:37:32.210 --> 01:37:35.309
Ron, Ron, come on, get out of bed!

814
01:37:35.310 --> 01:37:36.090
Why?

815
01:37:36.116 --> 01:37:39.235
There's something you've got to see.
Now, come on!

816
01:37:45.610 --> 01:37:50.210
Come on! Come!
Come look, it's my parents!

817
01:37:51.410 --> 01:37:53.609
I only see us.

818
01:37:53.610 --> 01:37:57.109
Look in properly.
Go on, stand there.

819
01:37:57.110 --> 01:38:03.310
- There. You see them, don't you?
- That's me! Only I'm head boy.

820
01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:06.109
And I'm holding the Quidditch Cup.

821
01:38:06.110 --> 01:38:10.610
And bloody hell!
I'm Quidditch captain too!

822
01:38:11.410 --> 01:38:14.210
I look good.

823
01:38:14.510 --> 01:38:18.509
Harry, do you think this mirror
shows the future?

824
01:38:18.510 --> 01:38:23.810
How can it?
Both my parents are dead.

825
01:38:37.110 --> 01:38:39.710
Do you like yours, Ron?

826
01:38:43.310 --> 01:38:47.610
- Ron?
- I'll be right back.

827
01:38:57.110 --> 01:39:00.709
- Wanna play chess?
- No.

828
01:39:00.710 --> 01:39:05.409
- Wanna go and visit Hagrid?
- No.

829
01:39:05.410 --> 01:39:09.209
Harry, I know what you're thinking,
but don't.

830
01:39:09.210 --> 01:39:13.410
There's something not right
about that mirror.

831
01:39:39.610 --> 01:39:42.110
Back again, Harry?

832
01:39:44.910 --> 01:39:47.609
I see that you,
like so many before you...

833
01:39:47.610 --> 01:39:52.109
...have discovered the delights
of the Mirror of Erised.

834
01:39:52.110 --> 01:39:56.610
I trust by now
you realize what it does.

835
01:39:57.610 --> 01:40:00.410
Let me give you a clue.

836
01:40:00.710 --> 01:40:03.009
The happiest man on earth...

837
01:40:03.010 --> 01:40:06.609
...would look into the mirror
and see only himself...

838
01:40:06.610 --> 01:40:09.109
...exactly as he is.

839
01:40:09.110 --> 01:40:14.409
So then, it shows us what we want.
Whatever we want.

840
01:40:14.410 --> 01:40:17.510
Yes. And no.

841
01:40:18.210 --> 01:40:20.809
It shows us nothing more or less...

842
01:40:20.810 --> 01:40:27.009
...than the deepest and most desperate
desires of our hearts.

843
01:40:27.010 --> 01:40:32.009
Now you, Harry, who have
never known your family...

844
01:40:32.010 --> 01:40:36.009
...you see them standing beside you.

845
01:40:36.010 --> 01:40:38.709
But remember this, Harry.

846
01:40:38.710 --> 01:40:44.809
This mirror gives us
neither knowledge...

847
01:40:44.810 --> 01:40:47.210
...or truth.

848
01:40:47.910 --> 01:40:54.210
Men have wasted away in front of it.
Even gone mad.

849
01:40:55.010 --> 01:40:59.309
That is why tomorrow
it will be moved to a new home.

850
01:40:59.310 --> 01:41:01.510
And I must ask you...

851
01:41:02.210 --> 01:41:06.410
...not to go looking for it again.

852
01:41:06.810 --> 01:41:10.310
It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry...

853
01:41:10.510 --> 01:41:13.710
...and forget to live.

854
01:42:09.710 --> 01:42:12.010
Hi, Hedwig.

855
01:42:13.510 --> 01:42:17.609
Look at you, playing with your cards.
Pathetic!

856
01:42:17.610 --> 01:42:19.909
We've got final exams coming up soon.

857
01:42:19.910 --> 01:42:22.709
I'm ready. Ask me any question.

858
01:42:22.710 --> 01:42:27.209
Alright, what are the 3 most crucial ingredients
in a Forgetfulness Potion?

859
01:42:27.210 --> 01:42:28.709
I forgot.

860
01:42:28.710 --> 01:42:31.909
And what, may I ask, do you plan to do
if this comes up in the final exam?

861
01:42:31.910 --> 01:42:34.209
- Copy off you.
- No, you won't.

862
01:42:34.210 --> 01:42:37.154
Besides, according to Professor
McGonagall, we're to be

863
01:42:37.180 --> 01:42:40.309
given special quills bewitched
with an Anti-Cheating Spell.

864
01:42:40.310 --> 01:42:46.910
That's insulting! It's as if they
don't trust us! Dumbledore again!

865
01:42:50.310 --> 01:42:54.610
- Leg-Locker Curse?
- Malfoy.

866
01:42:59.510 --> 01:43:02.810
You have got to start
standing up to people, Neville.

867
01:43:02.910 --> 01:43:06.509
How? I can barely stand at all!

868
01:43:06.510 --> 01:43:08.810
I'll do the countercurse!

869
01:43:08.910 --> 01:43:13.309
No, that's all I need!
You to set my bloody kneecups on fire!

870
01:43:13.310 --> 01:43:16.909
I don't appreciate
the insinuation, Longbottom.

871
01:43:16.910 --> 01:43:20.309
Besides, if anyone cared to notice...

872
01:43:20.310 --> 01:43:24.910
...my eyebrows have
completely grown back!

873
01:43:28.010 --> 01:43:30.309
I found him!

874
01:43:30.310 --> 01:43:35.709
"Dumbledore is particularly famous for his
defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945."

875
01:43:35.710 --> 01:43:36.390
Go on!

876
01:43:36.416 --> 01:43:39.109
"For the discovery of the
twelve uses of dragon blood...

877
01:43:39.110 --> 01:43:42.409
...and his work on alchemy with his
partner, Nicholas Flamel"!

878
01:43:42.410 --> 01:43:46.009
I knew the name sound familiar.
I read it on the train that day.

879
01:43:46.010 --> 01:43:48.610
Follow me!

880
01:43:52.110 --> 01:43:56.110
Hey! Wait! Where are you going?

881
01:43:57.610 --> 01:44:01.210
What about the countercurse?

882
01:44:02.410 --> 01:44:08.309
I had you looking in the wrong section.
How could I be so stupid?

883
01:44:08.310 --> 01:44:11.609
I checked this out weeks ago
for a bit of light reading.

884
01:44:11.610 --> 01:44:13.910
This is light?

885
01:44:18.210 --> 01:44:20.809
Of course! Here it is!

886
01:44:20.810 --> 01:44:25.109
Nicholas Flamel is the only known
maker of the Philosopher's Stone.

887
01:44:25.110 --> 01:44:26.510
The what?

888
01:44:26.910 --> 01:44:30.109
Honestly, don't you two read?

889
01:44:30.110 --> 01:44:34.809
"The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary
substance with astonishing powers.

890
01:44:34.810 --> 01:44:37.609
It'll transform any metal
into pure gold...

891
01:44:37.610 --> 01:44:41.909
...and produces the Elixir of Life
which will make the drinker immortal."

892
01:44:41.910 --> 01:44:44.209
- lmmortal?
- It means you'll never die.

893
01:44:44.210 --> 01:44:46.610
I know what it means!

894
01:44:47.210 --> 01:44:52.109
"The only Stone currently in existence
belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel...

895
01:44:52.110 --> 01:44:57.610
...the noted alchemist who last year
celebrated his 665th birthday."

896
01:44:59.010 --> 01:45:01.409
That's what Fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor.

897
01:45:01.410 --> 01:45:06.410
That's what's under the trap door.
The Philosopher's Stone.

898
01:45:22.586 --> 01:45:23.286
Hagrid.

899
01:45:23.310 --> 01:45:26.909
Oh, hello, sorry, don't wish to be rude,
but I'm in no fit state to entertain today.

900
01:45:26.910 --> 01:45:29.910
We know about the Philosopher's Stone.

901
01:45:34.310 --> 01:45:36.352
We think Snape's
trying to steal it.

902
01:45:36.378 --> 01:45:39.609
Snape? Blimey, you're not
still on about him, are you?

903
01:45:39.610 --> 01:45:42.710
Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone.
We just don't know why.

904
01:45:42.810 --> 01:45:47.209
Snape is one of the teachers
protecting the Stone. He's not about to steal it.

905
01:45:47.210 --> 01:45:48.509
What?

906
01:45:48.510 --> 01:45:52.109
You heard. Right. Come on, now,
I'm a bit preoccupied today.

907
01:45:52.110 --> 01:45:55.009
Wait a minute.
"One of the teachers"?

908
01:45:55.010 --> 01:45:59.109
Of course! There are other things
defending the Stone, aren't there?

909
01:45:59.110 --> 01:46:02.009
- Spells, enchantments.
- That's right.

910
01:46:02.010 --> 01:46:05.209
Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.

911
01:46:05.210 --> 01:46:07.509
Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy.

912
01:46:07.510 --> 01:46:11.409
Ain't a soul knows how,
except for me and Dumbledore.

913
01:46:11.410 --> 01:46:15.310
I shouldn't have told you that.
I should not have told you that.

914
01:46:28.810 --> 01:46:34.209
- Hagrid, what exactly is that?
- That? It's...

915
01:46:34.210 --> 01:46:36.409
I know what that is!

916
01:46:36.410 --> 01:46:39.310
But, Hagrid, how did you get one?

917
01:46:39.410 --> 01:46:42.909
I won it. Off a stranger
I met down at the pub.

918
01:46:42.910 --> 01:46:47.310
Seemed quite glad to be rid of it,
as a matter of fact.

919
01:47:09.210 --> 01:47:11.710
Is that...

920
01:47:12.210 --> 01:47:13.609
...a dragon?

921
01:47:13.610 --> 01:47:18.209
That's not just a dragon.
That's a Norwegian Ridgeback.

922
01:47:18.210 --> 01:47:21.309
My brother Charlie works
with these in Romania.

923
01:47:21.310 --> 01:47:26.510
Isn't he beautiful? Oh, bless him.
Look, he knows his mummy.

924
01:47:26.810 --> 01:47:28.909
Hello, Norbert.

925
01:47:28.910 --> 01:47:33.510
- Norbert?
- Yeah, well, he's gotta have a name, don't he?

926
01:47:34.010 --> 01:47:36.710
Don't you, Norbert?

927
01:47:43.410 --> 01:47:46.810
He'll have to be trained up a bit,
of course.

928
01:47:50.410 --> 01:47:52.810
Who's that?

929
01:47:54.210 --> 01:47:56.610
Malfoy.

930
01:47:57.010 --> 01:47:58.710
Oh, dear.

931
01:48:00.210 --> 01:48:05.209
Hagrid always wanted a dragon.
He told me so the first time I met him.

932
01:48:05.210 --> 01:48:09.409
It's crazy.
And worse, Malfoy knows.

933
01:48:09.410 --> 01:48:13.809
- I don't understand. ls that bad?
- It's bad.

934
01:48:13.810 --> 01:48:16.310
Good evening.

935
01:48:19.610 --> 01:48:22.809
Nothing, I repeat, nothing...

936
01:48:22.810 --> 01:48:26.509
...gives a student the right
to walk about the school at night.

937
01:48:26.510 --> 01:48:31.609
Therefore, as punishment for your actions,
50 points will be taken.

938
01:48:31.610 --> 01:48:34.210
- 50?!
- Each.

939
01:48:34.910 --> 01:48:37.509
And to ensure it doesn't happen again...

940
01:48:37.510 --> 01:48:41.110
...all four of you
will receive detention.

941
01:48:41.810 --> 01:48:45.009
Excuse me, professor,
perhaps I heard you wrong.

942
01:48:45.010 --> 01:48:47.509
I thought you said the four of us.

943
01:48:47.510 --> 01:48:50.209
No, you heard me correctly, Mr. Malfoy.

944
01:48:50.210 --> 01:48:55.510
You see, honorable as your intentions were,
you too were out of bed after hours.

945
01:48:55.710 --> 01:48:58.910
You will join your classmates
in detention.

946
01:49:09.810 --> 01:49:14.009
A pity they let
the old punishments die.

947
01:49:14.010 --> 01:49:19.009
There was a time detention would find you
hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons.

948
01:49:19.010 --> 01:49:22.110
God, I miss the screaming.

949
01:49:24.410 --> 01:49:27.909
You'll be serving detention
with Hagrid tonight.

950
01:49:27.910 --> 01:49:33.510
He's got a little job to do
inside the Dark Forest.

951
01:49:35.310 --> 01:49:38.510
A sorry lot, this, Hagrid.

952
01:49:39.710 --> 01:49:45.010
Oh, good God, man, you're not still on
about that bloody dragon, are you?

953
01:49:47.010 --> 01:49:49.310
Norbert's gone.

954
01:49:49.610 --> 01:49:53.409
Dumbledore sent him off to Romania
to live in a colony.

955
01:49:53.410 --> 01:49:56.809
Well, that's good, isn't it?
He'll be with his own kind.

956
01:49:56.810 --> 01:49:59.409
Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania?

957
01:49:59.410 --> 01:50:03.910
What if the other dragons are mean
to him? He's only a baby, after all.

958
01:50:04.310 --> 01:50:09.809
Oh, for God's sake, pull yourself together, man.
You're going into the Forest, after all.

959
01:50:09.810 --> 01:50:12.309
Got to have your wits about you.

960
01:50:12.310 --> 01:50:18.310
The Forest? I thought that was a joke.
We can't go in there.

961
01:50:18.410 --> 01:50:22.610
Students aren't allowed.
And there are...

962
01:50:23.810 --> 01:50:25.410
...werewolves.

963
01:50:25.510 --> 01:50:29.009
There's more than werewolves
in those trees, lad.

964
01:50:29.010 --> 01:50:32.010
You can be sure of that.

965
01:50:33.610 --> 01:50:35.310
Nighty-night.

966
01:50:37.610 --> 01:50:40.810
Right. Let's go.

967
01:51:18.710 --> 01:51:21.309
Hagrid, what is that?

968
01:51:21.310 --> 01:51:25.010
What we're here for.
See that?

969
01:51:25.210 --> 01:51:30.910
That's unicorn blood, that is.
I found one dead a few weeks ago.

970
01:51:31.110 --> 01:51:36.010
Now, this one's been hurt bad
by something.

971
01:51:43.210 --> 01:51:49.209
So, it's our job to go
and find the poor beast.

972
01:51:49.210 --> 01:51:52.610
Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me.

973
01:51:52.810 --> 01:51:56.310
And, Harry, you'll go with Malfoy.

974
01:51:57.310 --> 01:51:59.809
Okay. Then I get Fang.

975
01:51:59.810 --> 01:52:05.810
Fine. Just so you know,
he's a bloody coward.

976
01:52:09.210 --> 01:52:14.409
You wait till my father hears about this.
This is servant's stuff.

977
01:52:14.410 --> 01:52:18.509
If I didn't know better, Draco,
I'd say you were scared.

978
01:52:18.510 --> 01:52:21.410
I'm not scared, Potter.

979
01:52:22.210 --> 01:52:24.510
Did you hear that?

980
01:52:26.810 --> 01:52:28.409
Come on, Fang.

981
01:52:28.410 --> 01:52:30.210
Scared!

982
01:52:54.910 --> 01:52:57.310
What is it, Fang?

983
01:54:07.410 --> 01:54:13.109
Harry Potter, you must leave.
You are known to many creatures here.

984
01:54:13.110 --> 01:54:17.309
The Forest is not safe at this time.
Especially for you.

985
01:54:17.310 --> 01:54:20.309
What was that thing you saved me from?

986
01:54:20.310 --> 01:54:25.809
A monstrous creature.
It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn.

987
01:54:25.810 --> 01:54:31.609
Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep
you alive even if you are an inch from death.

988
01:54:31.610 --> 01:54:36.909
But at a terrible price. You
have slain something so pure...

989
01:54:36.910 --> 01:54:41.909
...that from the moment the blood touches
your lips, you will have a half-life.

990
01:54:41.910 --> 01:54:43.909
A cursed life.

991
01:54:43.910 --> 01:54:48.109
- But who would choose such a life?
- Can you think of no one?

992
01:54:48.110 --> 01:54:53.409
Do you mean to say that
thing that killed the unicorn...

993
01:54:53.410 --> 01:54:57.509
...that was drinking its blood,
that was Voldemort?

994
01:54:57.510 --> 01:55:03.010
Do you know what is hidden
in the school at this very moment, Mr. Potter?

995
01:55:03.510 --> 01:55:05.410
The Philosopher's Stone.

996
01:55:06.410 --> 01:55:08.710
Harry!

997
01:55:09.010 --> 01:55:13.709
Hello there, Firenze.
See you've met our young Mr. Potter.

998
01:55:13.710 --> 01:55:16.210
You all right there, Harry?

999
01:55:17.010 --> 01:55:21.610
Harry Potter,
this is where I leave you.

1000
01:55:22.210 --> 01:55:26.310
You're safe now. Good luck.

1001
01:55:33.610 --> 01:55:38.009
You mean, You-Know-Who is out there
right now in the Forest?

1002
01:55:38.010 --> 01:55:41.009
But he's weak.
He's living off the unicorns.

1003
01:55:41.010 --> 01:55:44.109
Don't you see? We had it wrong.

1004
01:55:44.110 --> 01:55:48.709
Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself.
He wants the stone for Voldemort.

1005
01:55:48.710 --> 01:55:53.409
With the Elixir of Life,
Voldemort will be strong again.

1006
01:55:53.410 --> 01:55:55.209
He'll come back.

1007
01:55:55.210 --> 01:55:57.209
But if he comes back...

1008
01:55:57.210 --> 01:56:01.510
...you don't think he'll try
to kill you, do you?

1009
01:56:02.210 --> 01:56:06.009
I think if he'd had the chance,
he might have tried to kill me tonight.

1010
01:56:06.010 --> 01:56:09.809
And to think, I've been worrying
about my Potions final.

1011
01:56:09.810 --> 01:56:13.709
Hang on a minute.
We're forgetting one thing.

1012
01:56:13.710 --> 01:56:18.910
Who's the one wizard
Voldemort always feared?

1013
01:56:19.410 --> 01:56:24.709
Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore
is around, Harry, you're safe.

1014
01:56:24.710 --> 01:56:29.110
As long as Dumbledore is around,
you can't be touched.

1015
01:56:34.510 --> 01:56:40.109
I'd always heard Hogwarts' end of the year exams
were frightful, but I found that rather enjoyable.

1016
01:56:40.110 --> 01:56:44.009
Speak for yourself.
All right there, Harry?

1017
01:56:44.010 --> 01:56:49.409
- My scar. It keeps burning.
- It's happened before.

1018
01:56:49.410 --> 01:56:52.309
- Not like this.
- Perhaps you should see the nurse.

1019
01:56:52.310 --> 01:56:56.110
I think it's a warning.
It means danger's coming.

1020
01:57:03.410 --> 01:57:06.109
- Of course!
- What is it?

1021
01:57:06.110 --> 01:57:10.009
Don't you think it's a bit odd that what
Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon...

1022
01:57:10.010 --> 01:57:13.309
...and a stranger turns up who
just happens to have one?

1023
01:57:13.310 --> 01:57:16.209
I mean, how many people wander around
with dragon eggs in their pockets?

1024
01:57:16.210 --> 01:57:18.810
Why didn't I see it before?

1025
01:57:24.010 --> 01:57:27.809
Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg?
What did he look like?

1026
01:57:27.810 --> 01:57:30.709
I don't know, I never saw his face.
He kept his hood up.

1027
01:57:30.710 --> 01:57:33.610
The stranger, though, You and he
must have talked.

1028
01:57:33.910 --> 01:57:37.609
Well, he wanted to know what sort
of creatures I looked after.

1029
01:57:37.610 --> 01:57:41.809
I told him. I said, "After Fluffy,
a dragon's gonna be no problem."

1030
01:57:41.810 --> 01:57:46.610
- And did he seem interested in Fluffy?
- Well, of course he was interested in Fluffy.

1031
01:57:46.710 --> 01:57:51.109
How often do you come across a
three-headed dog, even if you're in the trade?

1032
01:57:51.110 --> 01:57:57.009
But I told him. I said, "The trick with any beast
is to know how to calm him."

1033
01:57:57.010 --> 01:58:02.710
Take Fluffy, for example. Just play him a bit of
music and he falls straight to sleep.

1034
01:58:04.010 --> 01:58:07.009
I shouldn't have told you that.

1035
01:58:07.010 --> 01:58:09.510
Where are you going? Wait!

1036
01:58:16.210 --> 01:58:19.310
We have to see Professor Dumbledore.
Immediately!

1037
01:58:19.410 --> 01:58:22.309
I'm afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here.

1038
01:58:22.310 --> 01:58:27.009
He received an urgent owl from the
Ministry of Magic and left immediately for London.

1039
01:58:27.010 --> 01:58:29.809
He's gone? Now?
But this is important!

1040
01:58:29.810 --> 01:58:32.310
This is about the Philosopher's Stone!

1041
01:58:33.910 --> 01:58:37.910
- How do you know...?
- Someone's going to try and steal it.

1042
01:58:38.210 --> 01:58:41.093
I don't know how you three
found out about the stone,

1043
01:58:41.119 --> 01:58:43.709
but I assure you it is
perfectly well protected.

1044
01:58:43.710 --> 01:58:48.310
Now would you go back
to your dormitories? Quietly.

1045
01:58:56.310 --> 01:58:59.309
That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village.
It was Snape.

1046
01:58:59.310 --> 01:59:02.209
Which means he knows
how to get past Fluffy.

1047
01:59:02.210 --> 01:59:06.310
- And with Dumbledore gone...
- Good afternoon.

1048
01:59:08.110 --> 01:59:11.409
Now, what would three young
Gryffindors such as yourselves...

1049
01:59:11.410 --> 01:59:16.010
...be doing inside on a day like this?

1050
01:59:20.410 --> 01:59:24.310
- We were just...
- You ought to be careful.

1051
01:59:24.610 --> 01:59:26.810
People will think you're...

1052
01:59:30.810 --> 01:59:33.810
...up to something.

1053
01:59:43.810 --> 01:59:46.009
Now what do we do?

1054
01:59:46.010 --> 01:59:50.110
We go down the trap door. Tonight.

1055
02:00:03.610 --> 02:00:05.309
Trevor.

1056
02:00:05.310 --> 02:00:09.009
Trevor, shh! go! You shouldn't be here!

1057
02:00:09.010 --> 02:00:14.609
Neither should you.
You're sneaking out again, aren't you?

1058
02:00:14.610 --> 02:00:18.809
- Now, Neville, listen. We were...
- No, I won't let you!

1059
02:00:18.810 --> 02:00:23.609
You'll get Gryffindor into trouble again.
I'll fight you.

1060
02:00:23.610 --> 02:00:28.310
Neville, I'm really really sorry about this.
Petrificus Totalus.

1061
02:00:35.910 --> 02:00:40.009
You're a little scary sometimes,
you know that?

1062
02:00:40.010 --> 02:00:43.910
Brilliant, but scary.

1063
02:00:44.210 --> 02:00:46.509
Let's go.

1064
02:00:46.510 --> 02:00:51.110
- Sorry.
- It's for your own good, you know.

1065
02:00:56.210 --> 02:01:00.510
- Ow! You stood on my foot!
- Sorry.

1066
02:01:04.010 --> 02:01:06.410
Alohomora.

1067
02:01:18.110 --> 02:01:20.910
Wait a minute. He's...

1068
02:01:21.910 --> 02:01:24.310
...snoring.

1069
02:01:26.610 --> 02:01:32.410
Snape's already been here.
He's put a spell on the harp.

1070
02:01:33.710 --> 02:01:37.010
It's got horrible breath.

1071
02:01:39.310 --> 02:01:41.609
- We have to move its paw.
- What?

1072
02:01:41.610 --> 02:01:43.310
Come on!

1073
02:01:47.010 --> 02:01:49.410
Okay. Push.

1074
02:02:12.210 --> 02:02:16.109
I'll go first. Don't follow
until I give you a sign.

1075
02:02:16.110 --> 02:02:21.410
If something bad happens,
get yourselves out.

1076
02:02:21.910 --> 02:02:25.710
Does it seem a bit quiet to you?

1077
02:02:26.010 --> 02:02:28.210
The harp.

1078
02:02:28.610 --> 02:02:31.610
It's stopped playing.

1079
02:02:41.310 --> 02:02:42.710
Jump!

1080
02:02:56.610 --> 02:03:00.510
Lucky this plant thing's here, really.

1081
02:03:14.710 --> 02:03:18.009
Stop moving, both of you.
This is Devil's Snare.

1082
02:03:18.010 --> 02:03:21.909
You have to relax. If you don't,
it will only kill you faster.

1083
02:03:21.910 --> 02:03:27.210
Kill us faster?
Oh, now I can relax!

1084
02:03:29.210 --> 02:03:30.810
Hermione!

1085
02:03:31.110 --> 02:03:35.109
- Now what are we gonna do?
- Just relax!

1086
02:03:35.110 --> 02:03:39.910
- Hermione, where are you?
- Do what I say! Trust me.

1087
02:03:46.710 --> 02:03:50.209
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1088
02:03:50.210 --> 02:03:53.509
- He's not relaxing, is he?
- Apparently not.

1089
02:03:53.510 --> 02:03:56.209
- We've gotta do something.
- What?

1090
02:03:56.210 --> 02:03:59.510
I remember reading something
in Herbology.

1091
02:04:00.010 --> 02:04:04.109
Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare.
It's deadly fun...

1092
02:04:04.110 --> 02:04:08.709
...but will sulk in the sun!
That's it! Devil Snare hates sunlight.

1093
02:04:08.710 --> 02:04:11.110
Lumus Solem.

1094
02:04:18.810 --> 02:04:21.710
- Ron, you okay?
- Yeah.

1095
02:04:24.110 --> 02:04:26.910
Lucky we didn't panic.

1096
02:04:27.410 --> 02:04:31.110
Lucky Hermione pays attention
in Herbology.

1097
02:04:32.510 --> 02:04:34.209
What is that?

1098
02:04:34.210 --> 02:04:38.210
I don't know. Sounds like wings.

1099
02:04:51.010 --> 02:04:54.709
Curious. I've never seen
birds like these.

1100
02:04:54.710 --> 02:04:58.609
They're not birds.
They're keys.

1101
02:04:58.610 --> 02:05:02.310
And I'll bet one of them
fits that door.

1102
02:05:05.510 --> 02:05:10.410
- What's this all about?
- I don't know.

1103
02:05:16.010 --> 02:05:18.310
Strange.

1104
02:05:18.410 --> 02:05:21.010
Alohomora!

1105
02:05:23.710 --> 02:05:26.209
Well, it was worth a try.

1106
02:05:26.210 --> 02:05:29.609
What're we going to do?
There must be a thousand keys up there.

1107
02:05:29.610 --> 02:05:33.809
We're looking for a big old fashioned one.
Probably rusty like the handle.

1108
02:05:33.810 --> 02:05:37.510
There! I see it!
The one with the broken wing.

1109
02:05:40.810 --> 02:05:43.410
What's wrong, Harry?

1110
02:05:44.010 --> 02:05:45.709
It's too simple.

1111
02:05:45.710 --> 02:05:50.609
Oh, go on, Harry! If Snape could catch it
on that old broomstick, you can.

1112
02:05:50.610 --> 02:05:54.510
You're the youngest Seeker
in a century.

1113
02:06:11.010 --> 02:06:14.310
This complicates things a bit.

1114
02:06:35.310 --> 02:06:37.510
Catch the key!

1115
02:06:41.610 --> 02:06:43.910
Hurry up!

1116
02:07:16.010 --> 02:07:20.909
I don't like this.
I don't like this at all.

1117
02:07:20.910 --> 02:07:24.410
Where are we? A graveyard.

1118
02:07:24.510 --> 02:07:27.410
This is no graveyard.

1119
02:07:34.610 --> 02:07:37.810
It's a chessboard.

1120
02:07:49.510 --> 02:07:51.710
There's the door.

1121
02:08:03.510 --> 02:08:05.310
Now what do we do?

1122
02:08:05.410 --> 02:08:09.810
It's obvious, isn't it? We've got
to play our way across the room.

1123
02:08:10.110 --> 02:08:14.110
Alright. Harry, you take
the empty bishop's square.

1124
02:08:14.210 --> 02:08:18.609
Hermione, you'll be
the queen-side castle.

1125
02:08:18.610 --> 02:08:23.010
As for me, I'll be a knight.

1126
02:08:29.810 --> 02:08:31.910
What happens now?

1127
02:08:32.410 --> 02:08:35.609
Well, white moves first.

1128
02:08:35.610 --> 02:08:37.710
And then...

1129
02:08:39.210 --> 02:08:40.710
...we play.

1130
02:08:51.010 --> 02:08:56.309
Ron, you don't suppose
this is going to be like...

1131
02:08:56.310 --> 02:09:00.209
...real wizard's chess, do you?

1132
02:09:00.210 --> 02:09:03.510
You there, d5.

1133
02:09:17.810 --> 02:09:19.609
Yes, Hermione.

1134
02:09:19.610 --> 02:09:25.010
I think this is gonna be
exactly like wizard's chess.

1135
02:09:30.610 --> 02:09:33.410
Castle to e4!

1136
02:09:36.710 --> 02:09:39.310
Pawn to c3!

1137
02:10:23.710 --> 02:10:27.909
- Wait a minute.
- You understand right, Harry.

1138
02:10:27.910 --> 02:10:32.910
Once I make my move,
the queen will take me.

1139
02:10:33.210 --> 02:10:35.809
Then you're free to check the king.

1140
02:10:35.810 --> 02:10:38.810
- No. Ron, no!
- What is it?

1141
02:10:39.110 --> 02:10:44.009
- He's going to sacrifice himself.
- No, you can't! there must be another way!

1142
02:10:44.010 --> 02:10:48.009
Do you wanna stop Snape
from getting that Stone or not?

1143
02:10:48.010 --> 02:10:51.910
Harry, it's you that has to go on.
I know it.

1144
02:10:52.110 --> 02:10:55.110
Not me. Not Hermione. You.

1145
02:11:05.110 --> 02:11:08.310
Knight to h3.

1146
02:11:28.910 --> 02:11:31.210
Check.

1147
02:12:00.110 --> 02:12:02.109
Ron!

1148
02:12:02.110 --> 02:12:08.210
No, don't move!
Don't forget, we're still playing.

1149
02:12:23.010 --> 02:12:24.510
Checkmate.

1150
02:12:44.210 --> 02:12:46.909
Take care of Ron.
Then go to the owlery.

1151
02:12:46.910 --> 02:12:51.009
Send a message to Dumbledore.
Ron's right.

1152
02:12:51.010 --> 02:12:53.110
I have to go on.

1153
02:12:53.410 --> 02:12:59.509
You'll be okay, Harry.
You're a great wizard. You really are.

1154
02:12:59.510 --> 02:13:02.310
Not as good as you.

1155
02:13:02.810 --> 02:13:07.910
Me? Books and cleverness.
There are more important things.

1156
02:13:08.910 --> 02:13:14.810
Friendship and bravery.
And, Harry, just be careful.

1157
02:13:52.610 --> 02:13:54.510
You?

1158
02:13:55.010 --> 02:13:59.109
No, it can't be.
Snape, he was the...

1159
02:13:59.110 --> 02:14:02.309
Yes, he does seem the type,
doesn't he?

1160
02:14:02.310 --> 02:14:05.709
Next to him, who would suspect...

1161
02:14:05.710 --> 02:14:09.809
...poor, stuttering
Professor Quirrell?

1162
02:14:09.810 --> 02:14:15.409
But that day, during the Quidditch match,
Snape tried to kill me.

1163
02:14:15.410 --> 02:14:18.510
No, dear boy. I tried to kill you!

1164
02:14:18.710 --> 02:14:23.109
And trust me, if Snape's cloak hadn't caught
fire and broken my eye contact...

1165
02:14:23.110 --> 02:14:25.509
...l would have succeeded.

1166
02:14:25.510 --> 02:14:28.709
Even with Snape muttering
his little countercurse.

1167
02:14:28.710 --> 02:14:31.109
Snape was trying to save me?

1168
02:14:31.110 --> 02:14:36.709
I knew you were a danger to me right from the off.
Especially after Halloween.

1169
02:14:36.710 --> 02:14:41.109
- Then you let the troll in!
- Very good, Potter, yes.

1170
02:14:41.110 --> 02:14:44.410
Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled.

1171
02:14:44.710 --> 02:14:50.010
While everyone else was running about dungeon,
he went to the third floor to head me off.

1172
02:14:50.610 --> 02:14:54.410
He, of course, never trusted me again.

1173
02:14:55.110 --> 02:15:00.609
He rarely left me alone.
But he doesn't understand.

1174
02:15:00.610 --> 02:15:04.809
I'm never alone. Never.

1175
02:15:04.810 --> 02:15:09.210
Now, what does this mirror do?

1176
02:15:10.510 --> 02:15:12.910
I see what I desire.

1177
02:15:13.210 --> 02:15:17.809
I see myself holding the Stone.
But how do I get it?

1178
02:15:17.810 --> 02:15:20.310
Use the boy.

1179
02:15:20.810 --> 02:15:25.010
Come here, Potter! Now!

1180
02:15:36.810 --> 02:15:41.110
Tell me, what do you see?

1181
02:16:05.910 --> 02:16:08.609
What is it? What do you see?

1182
02:16:08.610 --> 02:16:13.909
I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore.
I've won the house cup.

1183
02:16:13.910 --> 02:16:15.810
He lies.

1184
02:16:16.010 --> 02:16:19.909
Tell the truth! What do you see?

1185
02:16:19.910 --> 02:16:24.509
- Let me speak to him.
- Master, you are not strong enough.

1186
02:16:24.510 --> 02:16:28.810
I have strength enough for this.

1187
02:16:46.710 --> 02:16:49.809
Harry Potter...

1188
02:16:49.810 --> 02:16:52.409
...we meet again.

1189
02:16:52.410 --> 02:16:54.009
Voldemort.

1190
02:16:54.010 --> 02:16:58.209
Yes. You see what I've become?

1191
02:16:58.210 --> 02:17:02.009
See what I must do to survive?

1192
02:17:02.010 --> 02:17:06.410
Live off another. A mere parasite.

1193
02:17:06.810 --> 02:17:10.309
Unicorn blood can sustain me...

1194
02:17:10.310 --> 02:17:14.209
...but it cannot give me
a body of my own.

1195
02:17:14.210 --> 02:17:18.009
But there is something that can.

1196
02:17:18.010 --> 02:17:23.910
Something that, conveniently enough,
lies in your pocket.

1197
02:17:24.010 --> 02:17:25.910
Stop him!

1198
02:17:30.610 --> 02:17:33.710
Don't be a fool.

1199
02:17:33.810 --> 02:17:37.209
Why suffer an horrific death...

1200
02:17:37.210 --> 02:17:41.009
...when you can join me and live?

1201
02:17:41.010 --> 02:17:42.410
Never!

1202
02:17:44.110 --> 02:17:49.210
Bravery. Your parents had it too.

1203
02:17:49.610 --> 02:17:53.209
Tell me, Harry...

1204
02:17:53.210 --> 02:17:57.309
...would you like to see
your mother and father again?

1205
02:17:57.310 --> 02:17:59.609
Together...

1206
02:17:59.610 --> 02:18:02.510
...we can bring them back.

1207
02:18:02.610 --> 02:18:07.610
All I ask is for something in return.

1208
02:18:14.010 --> 02:18:17.410
That's it, Harry.

1209
02:18:18.010 --> 02:18:22.109
There is no good and evil.

1210
02:18:22.110 --> 02:18:25.309
There is only power...

1211
02:18:25.310 --> 02:18:29.710
...and those too weak to seek it.

1212
02:18:30.110 --> 02:18:35.510
Together, we'll do
extraordinary things.

1213
02:18:35.610 --> 02:18:38.110
Just give me the Stone!

1214
02:18:40.410 --> 02:18:41.809
You liar!

1215
02:18:41.810 --> 02:18:44.310
Kill him!

1216
02:19:07.510 --> 02:19:13.110
- What is this magic?
- Fool, get the Stone!

1217
02:20:58.110 --> 02:21:00.910
Good afternoon, Harry.

1218
02:21:02.710 --> 02:21:07.409
- Tokens from your admirers?
- Admirers?

1219
02:21:07.410 --> 02:21:13.609
What happened down in the dungeons between
you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret.

1220
02:21:13.610 --> 02:21:18.710
So, naturally, the whole school knows.

1221
02:21:20.810 --> 02:21:24.609
I see that your friend Ronald
has saved you the trouble...

1222
02:21:24.610 --> 02:21:27.609
...of opening your Chocolate Frogs.

1223
02:21:27.610 --> 02:21:30.909
Ron was here? ls he all right?
What about Hermione?

1224
02:21:30.910 --> 02:21:36.110
Fine. They're both just fine.

1225
02:21:36.310 --> 02:21:39.410
- What happened to the Stone?
- Relax, dear boy.

1226
02:21:39.510 --> 02:21:42.609
The Stone has been destroyed.

1227
02:21:42.610 --> 02:21:46.609
My friend Nicholas and I
have had a little chat...

1228
02:21:46.610 --> 02:21:51.209
...and agreed it was best all around.

1229
02:21:51.210 --> 02:21:55.310
But then, Flamel,
he'll die, won't he?

1230
02:21:57.010 --> 02:22:02.709
He has enough Elixir
to set his affairs in order.

1231
02:22:02.710 --> 02:22:06.209
But yes, he will die.

1232
02:22:06.210 --> 02:22:08.809
How is it I got the Stone, sir?

1233
02:22:08.810 --> 02:22:11.609
One minute I was staring
in the mirror and the next...

1234
02:22:11.610 --> 02:22:16.009
You see, only a person...

1235
02:22:16.010 --> 02:22:20.109
...who wanted to find the Stone,
find it...

1236
02:22:20.110 --> 02:22:25.010
...but not use it,
would be able to get it.

1237
02:22:25.610 --> 02:22:29.409
That is one of my more brilliant ideas.

1238
02:22:29.410 --> 02:22:34.710
And between you and me,
that is saying something.

1239
02:22:35.810 --> 02:22:41.309
Does that mean, with the Stone gone that is,
that Voldemort can never come back?

1240
02:22:41.310 --> 02:22:43.910
I'm afraid...

1241
02:22:45.010 --> 02:22:49.410
...there are ways
in which he can return.

1242
02:22:49.810 --> 02:22:52.609
Harry, do you know why...

1243
02:22:52.610 --> 02:22:56.809
...Professor Quirrell couldn't bear
to have you touch him?

1244
02:22:56.810 --> 02:23:01.710
It was because of your mother.
She sacrificed herself for you.

1245
02:23:02.010 --> 02:23:05.409
And that kind of act leaves a mark.

1246
02:23:05.410 --> 02:23:09.409
No, this kind of mark cannot be seen.

1247
02:23:09.410 --> 02:23:14.610
- It lives in your very skin.
- What is it?

1248
02:23:15.210 --> 02:23:19.210
Love, Harry. Love.

1249
02:23:27.010 --> 02:23:31.309
Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.

1250
02:23:31.310 --> 02:23:36.209
I was most unfortunate in my youth
to come across a vomit-flavored one.

1251
02:23:36.210 --> 02:23:39.709
And since then, I'm afraid,
I've lost my liking for them.

1252
02:23:39.710 --> 02:23:43.309
But I think I could be safe...

1253
02:23:43.310 --> 02:23:46.010
...with a nice toffee.

1254
02:23:49.810 --> 02:23:51.610
Alas!

1255
02:23:52.010 --> 02:23:54.410
Earwax.

1256
02:24:09.410 --> 02:24:12.810
- All right there, Ron?
- All right. You?

1257
02:24:13.610 --> 02:24:16.710
All right. Hermione?

1258
02:24:17.010 --> 02:24:19.210
Never better.

1259
02:24:34.710 --> 02:24:37.410
Another year gone.

1260
02:24:37.910 --> 02:24:42.609
And now, as I understand it,
the house cup needs awarding.

1261
02:24:42.610 --> 02:24:45.509
And the points stand thus:

1262
02:24:45.510 --> 02:24:51.610
ln fourth place,
Gryffindor with 312 points.

1263
02:24:53.210 --> 02:24:59.210
Third place,
Hufflepuff with 352 points.

1264
02:25:04.210 --> 02:25:06.209
In second place...

1265
02:25:06.210 --> 02:25:11.310
...Ravenclaw with 426 points.

1266
02:25:16.710 --> 02:25:18.709
And in first place...

1267
02:25:18.710 --> 02:25:24.510
...with 472 points, Slytherin house.

1268
02:25:29.710 --> 02:25:32.310
Nice one, mate.

1269
02:25:35.810 --> 02:25:39.909
Yes, yes, well done, Slytherin.
Well done, Slytherin.

1270
02:25:39.910 --> 02:25:44.609
However, recent events must
be taken into account.

1271
02:25:44.610 --> 02:25:49.910
And I have a few last-minute points
to award.

1272
02:25:50.210 --> 02:25:55.909
To Miss Hermione Granger,
for the cool use of intellect...

1273
02:25:55.910 --> 02:25:59.010
...while others were in grave peril...

1274
02:25:59.410 --> 02:26:02.010
...50 points.

1275
02:26:02.610 --> 02:26:04.210
Good job.

1276
02:26:11.610 --> 02:26:17.910
Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley,
for the best-played game of chess...

1277
02:26:18.210 --> 02:26:23.710
...that Hogwarts has seen
these many years, 50 points.

1278
02:26:28.010 --> 02:26:30.410
And third...

1279
02:26:30.610 --> 02:26:33.709
...to Mr. Harry Potter...

1280
02:26:33.710 --> 02:26:38.310
...for pure nerve
and outstanding courage...

1281
02:26:38.610 --> 02:26:43.810
...l award Gryffindor house 60 points.

1282
02:26:51.810 --> 02:26:53.909
We're tied with Slytherin!

1283
02:26:53.910 --> 02:27:00.109
Finally, it takes a great deal of bravery
to stand up to your enemies...

1284
02:27:00.110 --> 02:27:04.209
...but a great deal more
to stand up to your friends.

1285
02:27:04.210 --> 02:27:07.409
I award 10 points...

1286
02:27:07.410 --> 02:27:10.910
...to Neville Longbottom.

1287
02:27:23.910 --> 02:27:27.609
Assuming that my calculations
are correct I believe...

1288
02:27:27.610 --> 02:27:32.410
...that a change
of decoration is in order.

1289
02:27:37.210 --> 02:27:40.810
Gryffindor wins the house cup.

1290
02:28:18.610 --> 02:28:22.109
Come on, now.
Hurry up, you'll be late.

1291
02:28:22.110 --> 02:28:26.710
Train's leaving. Go on.
Come on, hurry up.

1292
02:28:31.810 --> 02:28:35.410
- Come on, Harry.
- One minute.

1293
02:28:41.410 --> 02:28:45.410
Thought you were leaving
without saying goodbye, did you?

1294
02:28:48.410 --> 02:28:50.510
This is for you.

1295
02:29:07.010 --> 02:29:09.410
Thanks, Hagrid.

1296
02:29:14.910 --> 02:29:19.610
Go on. On with you. On with you now.
Oh, listen, Harry.

1297
02:29:19.810 --> 02:29:24.509
If that dolt of a cousin of yours,
Dudley, gives you any grief...

1298
02:29:24.510 --> 02:29:27.409
...you could always threaten him...

1299
02:29:27.410 --> 02:29:30.409
...with a nice pair of ears
to go with that tail of his.

1300
02:29:30.410 --> 02:29:35.810
But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic
away from Hogwarts. You know that.

1301
02:29:36.010 --> 02:29:40.610
I do. But your cousin don't, do he?

1302
02:29:45.810 --> 02:29:49.209
Feels strange to be going home,
doesn't it?

1303
02:29:49.210 --> 02:29:51.409
I'm not going home.

1304
02:29:51.410 --> 02:29:53.710
Not really.

1305
02:30:34.592 --> 02:30:40.589
Subtitles by Your Friend, awaqeded.
