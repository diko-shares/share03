00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.390
HEYMAN: When I read the first book,
it hadn't yet been published...

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.645
...and I had no idea
that it would become this.

3
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.332
GRINT: The books were huge
and it was quite a daunting thing...

4
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.269
...because obviously
you wanna get it right for everyone.

5
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.298
COLUMBUS: I was willing to do anything.
If they wanted me to sing and dance...

6
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.418
...I would have tried that if it meant that
I had the opportunity to direct the movie.

7
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.035
In those days, I was just a kid
who had no idea what she was doing.

8
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.297
I was proud I got a part, it wasn't,
"I got the part of Harry Potter."

9
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.279
It was like, you know, "I've got a part."

10
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.330
I had no idea what I was getting into.

11
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.721
MAN 1:
Roll, please.

12
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.866
MAN 2: Rolling.
MAN 3: And speed.

13
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.487
"Creating the World of Harry Potter."
Take one.

14
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.861
COLUMBUS:
Set and action.

15
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.508
When you begin the process
of making any film...

16
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.574
...there are innumerable decisions
that one has to make.

17
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.215
Decisions about the script...

18
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.559
...who your director is gonna be,
who are gonna play the parts.

19
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.919
Who your cameraman
and production designer is gonna be...

20
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.519
...who your costume designer
and visual-effects supervisor is gonna be.

21
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.942
All those decisions
are absolutely pivotal...

22
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.381
...to making the film that you,
as a producer...

23
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.304
...and the directors/director
want to make.

24
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.202
And I feel we've been very lucky
that at the very beginning...

25
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.410
...that we made
some pretty good decisions...

26
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.907
...that have held us in good stead
as the series has developed.

27
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.774
COLUMBUS: The first day of filming
was at the train station...

28
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.487
...and I just remember
being incredibly nervous.

29
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.257
I didn't sleep the night before.

30
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.776
That night, I felt all of the intense
pressure of what I was about to do.

31
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.479
And I thought, "If I fail, everyone
in the world will hate me forever."

32
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.191
So it's not that much pressure.

33
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.250
COLUMBUS:
Do the sunglasses help with contacts?

34
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.829
RADCLIFFE:
Yeah, I'm gonna take them off.

35
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.686
Excellent, that's good. That's
a good idea. Keep it on at all times.

36
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.349
RADCLIFFE: I will.
MAN: How are you doing, Dan?

37
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.182
HEYMAN: We filmed the last scene
of the first film...

38
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.959
...the kids saying goodbye to Hagrid.

39
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.640
It was incredibly exciting.

40
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.718
I was like,
"Oh, my goodness, here we are."

41
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.079
MAN 1: One sixty-five, take one.
A and B cameras common mark.

42
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.069
COLUMBUS: Set.
MAN 2: Okay, and background action.

43
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.459
COLUMBUS:
Action!

44
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.854
COLUMBUS: A lot of what happened
on that first day is a blur.

45
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.664
But I remember getting to the set
very, very early.

46
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.401
Probably an hour and a half
before I had to be there...

47
00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.530
...just so I could be more awake
and more alert.

48
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.332
I felt the earlier I got there
the better chance I had...

49
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.474
...of creating some magic in the scene.

50
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.765
And when I saw Dan that first day,
he was very nervous as well.

51
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.369
It was slightly nerve-wracking.

52
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.655
I was terrified...

53
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.027
...mainly because that day,
there were loads and loads of extras...

54
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.208
...and it was the prospect of them
all knowing who I was.

55
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.338
Which was quite frightening.
I'm trying to blend in. "Where is he?"

56
00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.939
MAN:
Door. The door.

57
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.357
It was so long
since you last reminded me, you see.

58
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.120
MAN:
All right, once again, right away.

59
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.950
I'd done a little bit of acting before,
and Emma and Rupert had done nothing.

60
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.915
-Now just--
-So I listen to him?

61
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.327
-Yeah.
-Walk in?

62
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.832
WATSON: Never stepped on a film set in
my life. Never acted professionally before.

63
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.211
You walk on to this set
with hundreds of crew.

64
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.354
It's not easy.
I thought it would be so much easier.

65
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.066
I thought it would be, you know,
sort of couple of takes.

66
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.327
COLUMBUS:
That's good, Rupert. Okay.

67
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.658
MAN: And background.
COLUMBUS: Action.

68
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.746
GRINT: I remember being quite nervous
for my first scene.

69
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.367
None of us were experienced
when we started.

70
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.229
And it was quite a scary world
to come into.

71
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.645
My first day, I was in Goathland,
on location. At the train station.

72
00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.670
And I was really nervous...

73
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.130
-...but it turned out it was quite cool.
-Come on, Dan.

74
00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.085
We all go to the other end
of the platform.

75
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.692
-Dan, Rupert, please.
WOMAN: Dan.

76
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.492
HEYMAN: That first day, we were trying
to get Dan's eyes to be green.

77
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.276
That's what they are in the book.
Dan was wearing contact lenses.

78
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.480
WOMAN:
You look there.

79
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.719
But he was allergic to them and ultimately
we made the decision to remove them.

80
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.203
But for the first day,
we tried to work through it.

81
00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.008
So for the last scene,
when he's saying goodbye to Hagrid...

82
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.092
...you can see
that almost his eyes tearing...

83
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.068
...and his eyes are a little bit swollen.

84
00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.339
Thanks, Hagrid.

85
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.649
HEYMAN:
And it feels like he's about to cry.

86
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.187
He probably was but he never complained
and we removed the contacts...

87
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.456
...and he's never had green eyes since.

88
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.066
COLUMBUS:
In the book, Hermione has buck teeth.

89
00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.381
And we were obsessed with making
Emma more Hermione-like.

90
00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.396
So in the very first scene that we shot
in the film, Emma is wearing fake teeth.

91
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.674
Feels strange to be going home,
doesn't it?

92
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.989
But we realized after the first day
of dailies that we could not do that...

93
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.079
...for the entire course of the picture.

94
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.439
And we were able to cut it in a way that
you really can't tell but they're there.

95
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.572
If you look closely enough,
she's wearing false teeth in that scene...

96
00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.150
...to make her more Hermione-like.

97
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.379
Come on, Harry.

98
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.069
COLUMBUS: It's almost like you
wanna be down here, over Hagrid.

99
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.857
We're making more of a definite move...

100
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.770
...as Harry comes to board,
we can stop over.

101
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.759
RADCLIFFE:
On the first day of filming...

102
00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.282
...it actually sunk in
that I'm playing Harry Potter...

103
00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.288
...and I realized, "Okay.
Okay, this isn't a dream anymore.

104
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.479
This is real life."

105
00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.877
Early on in the process, I felt that
the picture needed to be purely British.

106
00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.308
And so the entire casting process
began...

107
00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.974
...with thousands of casting tapes
we received.

108
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.802
And then we met
every potential child actor...

109
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.108
...any kid who had done a school play
and wanted to be in Harry Potter...

110
00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.039
...we met in England.

111
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.209
WATSON:
I was about 9 when I started auditioning.

112
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.842
I was already a very big fan
of the books...

113
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.209
...when this rumor started going around
in my school...

114
00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.371
...that there were these auditions
for Harry Potter.

115
00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.898
They were coming to school.

116
00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.670
My schoolteacher, called Mr. Hancock,
who's now left...

117
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.938
...got, I think a note, a letter, saying,
"If there's any kids in the school...

118
00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.854
...that you think could act
in the Harry Potter film...

119
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.732
...would you mind them auditioning?"

120
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.232
And then I had to go through
a lot of auditions.

121
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.508
When I was reading the books,
I always felt quite a connection to Ron.

122
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.640
I was watching Newsround...

123
00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.710
...and they told us how you could
audition for the Harry Potter film.

124
00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.682
And they said that you could send in
a form and a photograph of yourself.

125
00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.085
So I did that and sent it in there...

126
00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.153
...and a month went by
and still nothing happened...

127
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.821
...so I was on the Internet...

128
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.971
...and found out this one boy
sent in a video of himself...

129
00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.579
...reading out of a little script,
from the book.

130
00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.498
So I put together this little video thing...

131
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.344
...and sent that off
and then I got an audition.

132
00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.902
It was quite strange because-- Especially
in, like, the canteen, there was like...

133
00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.826
...about 20 other ginger people
that sort of looked quite similar to me.

134
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.263
So it was quite scary as well
because I've never auditioned before.

135
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.280
It was quite a new thing as well.

136
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.758
We narrowed down each role to about...

137
00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.416
...four or five kids
that we screen-tested.

138
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.497
So in terms of Emma Watson,
she was phenomenal.

139
00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.821
The camera loved her.

140
00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.299
She had Hermione's sense of humor.

141
00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.149
She was sharp as a whip
for an 11-year-old girl.

142
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.276
We had a couple of screen tests
where I had to learn lines.

143
00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.809
No, I don't say they were hard.

144
00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.605
No, they were quite enjoyable actually.

145
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.917
Seeing Emma Watson's screen test...

146
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.614
...we were all in agreement that Emma
was Hermione.

147
00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:22.013
For Rupert, for Ron Weasley,
same sort of situation happened.

148
00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.739
He immediately popped off the screen.

149
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.520
Rupert is a very shy kid...

150
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.929
...but he had this devilish,
mischievous quality...

151
00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.579
...and he had a face
that I have never seen before.

152
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.081
I mean, he was just unique...

153
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.289
...and his face was a wealth
of all these emotions.

154
00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.949
He had a wonderful sense of humor.

155
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.709
But also, a real sense of soul.

156
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.702
He really felt like
he was one of the Weasley children.

157
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.874
And we all fell in love with him
for Ron Weasley.

158
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.439
So we'd sort of found
our Ron and Hermione...

159
00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.572
...but we were becoming
increasingly nervous...

160
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.708
...because we had a film called Harry
Potter and the Philosopher's Stone...

161
00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.742
...and we didn't have Harry Potter.

162
00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:04.627
We began looking in November of 1999
before we had a director...

163
00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.857
...and it was quite scary.

164
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.315
Because here we were in July...

165
00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.881
...and we were shooting in September
and we didn't have Harry.

166
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.749
There was a sense of pressure
because everybody was talking about it.

167
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.265
The press was writing
about who's gonna play Harry Potter.

168
00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.769
The studio was on the phone,
"Have you found him yet?"

169
00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:24.069
Our casting director was going crazy
trying to find him.

170
00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:25.659
It was interminable...

171
00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.418
...you know, looking and looking
and looking and not finding.

172
00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:32.561
After we had looked at countless tapes
and seen countless kids...

173
00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.255
...I remember popping in a tape
of David Copperfield.

174
00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.974
And I saw Dan's scene and I thought:

175
00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.892
"This kid really has the potential
to be Harry Potter."

176
00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.239
But there was really a general reluctance
from the parents.

177
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:46.699
My mom and dad said, "No.

178
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.480
You know, that's far too much
of an upheaval of his life.

179
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.070
So he-- You know, Dan-- Not--

180
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:52.970
We can't let that happen."

181
00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.818
And one night, I went to the theater
with Steve Kloves.

182
00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.970
David Heyman sat in the row
in front of us...

183
00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.567
...at a production of a play
called Stones in His Pockets.

184
00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.247
And I looked up
and there was Alan Radcliffe...

185
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.575
...who was an agent at ICM,
who I knew.

186
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.468
And I said, "How are you?" "Great."

187
00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.934
And then next to him was Marcia,
his wife.

188
00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.415
And the boy at the end
was his son, Daniel.

189
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.344
So I went and sat down
in the row in front...

190
00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.434
...and I paid very little attention
to the play.

191
00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:24.557
I was always looking at my--
Over my shoulder at the boy behind.

192
00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.830
And he just had this quality
which was an old soul in a young body.

193
00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.142
I noticed David Heyman turning around
to me every so often...

194
00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.956
...and I was like, "Who's that man?"

195
00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:39.690
And then in the interval, he came up,
him and Steve Kloves came up...

196
00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.016
...and they introduced themselves.

197
00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.936
My dad just went, "Okay, maybe--"

198
00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.722
He saw it as a sign, like, I don't
believe in that kind of stuff particularly...

199
00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.239
...but he-- They took it as a sign
that it was somehow meant to be.

200
00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:52.733
And so they let me audition.

201
00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.003
COLUMBUS:
Two, three and action.

202
00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.345
That's a dragon egg.

203
00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.829
-What is it?
-That's what that it.

204
00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.309
-What is that?
-Dragon egg.

205
00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:03.048
I remember I auditioned, it was a whole
scene about a dragon egg in the first film.

206
00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.114
I think Chris Columbus
broke a real egg...

207
00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.892
COLUMBUS: Oh. Uh-oh.
-...and made me laugh.

208
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:12.155
COLUMBUS: Dan's screen test
was amazingly charming and soulful...

209
00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.042
...and he was inexperienced as an actor.

210
00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.261
One thing Dan had
that you couldn't teach anyone...

211
00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.489
...which was this sort of
haunted quality.

212
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.719
If you heard your Mom screaming
like that just about to be killed...

213
00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.679
...you wouldn't forget in a hurry.

214
00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:27.737
COLUMBUS: I just saw it in his eyes
in more serious moments.

215
00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.738
And that was the moment
I think that we all felt...

216
00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:34.039
...when we saw that screen test
to hire Dan as Harry Potter.

217
00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.499
COLUMBUS:
Excellent.

218
00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.029
Dad comes in and says:

219
00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.146
"I've just spoken to David Heyman
and you've got the part."

220
00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:42.172
And I cried and I was in the bath.

221
00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.193
MAN:
Why did you cry?

222
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.092
I-- No, I cried with happiness.

223
00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.752
So we ended up with our three, and I
don't think we could have done better.

224
00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.680
Three of them together, just perfect.

225
00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.538
They really felt like the characters
had jumped from the book.

226
00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.869
I checked this out first term
for a bit of light reading.

227
00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.419
-This is light?
-Shut up.

228
00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.416
RADCLIFFE: First time I actually met
Rupert and Emma...

229
00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.370
...I think we'd done
our screen test together.

230
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.218
But I still didn't know
who'd got the part, and then--

231
00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.132
And then when it was announced
we got the part...

232
00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.176
...was the first time we met properly.

233
00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:17.178
This is Dan and Rupert on the day
that they got the job.

234
00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.850
We brought all three of them here
and they came into my office.

235
00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.403
The last time we came in
I thought was another audition.

236
00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:26.759
But they took us to the producer's--
David Heyman's office.

237
00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:30.893
David Heyman tried to make it--
Tried to go into a great big paragraph...

238
00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.870
...and then Chris Columbus
just came out with it and said:

239
00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:37.910
"We want you to-- We want to cast you
as Ron and Hermione in the film."

240
00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.530
And I just stood there looking blank
at them for about five minutes...

241
00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:45.556
...until it really sunk in.
I was like, "Oh, my God."

242
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:50.649
I just stood there. I thought,
"No. This is all a dream. Pinch me."

243
00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.170
It was a complete shock.
It was so unexpected.

244
00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.870
But it was just--
It was just such a cool day.

245
00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:59.193
Here's them being photographed
on that first day.

246
00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.057
RADCLIFFE:
I remember very little about it.

247
00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.539
I remember Terry O'Neill, I believe,
was the photographer...

248
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.344
...who took the first photos of us.
He continually referred to us...

249
00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:09.434
...as the ginger boy, the one
with glasses and the girl.

250
00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.684
Because, of course, nobody knew
our names then.

251
00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.845
WATSON: I look back
on those photographs now...

252
00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.736
...and I feel like
that's a different person.

253
00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.622
I feel like I don't know that girl.

254
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.107
It's really strange. So much--
So much has happened since that day.

255
00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.428
[KIDS CHATTERING]

256
00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.345
Josh.

257
00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.000
HEYMAN: Working with children,
you have them...

258
00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.509
...for nine and a half hours a day.

259
00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.434
There's three hours for education,
an hour for lunch...

260
00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.917
...15-minute breaks every hour.

261
00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.385
So ultimately, you end up
shooting scenes with children...

262
00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:42.498
...for around four hours a day.
That's not very much.

263
00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.243
And it necessarily means
that our schedule is longer.

264
00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.695
You know, the longest
shoot I had done was 11 weeks.

265
00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.724
And suddenly we were on
for 11 months.

266
00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.485
Set and action.

267
00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.645
JAMES:
I'll never forget that set...

268
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.650
...kind of in the middle of nowhere
in northern England...

269
00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.997
...just thinking I've never been
so nervous all my life.

270
00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:01.335
Because you got the big steam train,
all the lights.

271
00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.878
-Hundreds of extras.
-Hundreds of extras, hundreds of crew.

272
00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.211
We kind of thought, "Is this what
every film is like?" where you've got...

273
00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.433
...thousands of crew, or thou--
You know.

274
00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.537
Like, most films last about six weeks,
not nine months.

275
00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:16.811
-This way, first years. Come on now.
HARRY: Hi, Hagrid.

276
00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:18.898
RON:
Whoa.

277
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.634
I thought the kids had experience...

278
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.310
...because they seemed
completely unfazed by--

279
00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.497
I mean, walking on to a big film set
is a scary thing...

280
00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.702
...if you're expected to do something
when they shout, "Go now."

281
00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.608
As an adult, it doesn't get
any less scary, really, the first day.

282
00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:35.742
They just seemed
completely cool to it all.

283
00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.690
Can you say, "Hey, Hagrid,"
a little earlier?

284
00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:42.290
-As soon as he says, "Hey, Hagrid--"
-But I thought--

285
00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:45.972
COLUMBUS:
A little higher on the lamp, Robbie.

286
00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.756
And action.

287
00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.073
All right now. First years, this way.

288
00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:54.956
HEYMAN:
Robbie Coltrane was Jo's idea.

289
00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.084
Because we wanted somebody
to play Hagrid...

290
00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:00.108
...who we knew could be tough
and dangerous...

291
00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:05.237
...but at the same time was warm
and vulnerable and very funny.

292
00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.929
And Robbie is all those things.

293
00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.351
Right then, follow me.

294
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.326
COLTRANE: There was just no question
of not doing it. You knew it was--

295
00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.366
So long as they were true to the book,
it was going to be wonderful.

296
00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.993
MAN 1:
Live shooting.

297
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.786
-Okay, roll sound.
MAN 2: Clip.

298
00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.790
COLUMBUS: Okay, class, listen to me.
Welcome to your fist flying lesson.

299
00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:27.419
I want you to raise your hand
over the broom.

300
00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.338
COLUMBUS: For the flying lesson,
I remember saying action...

301
00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.190
...and half of the kids
started performing...

302
00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.489
...the other half of the kids
are staring into space.

303
00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:39.356
We had to stop and I said, "You know,
'action' means we start shooting."

304
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.404
And I thought to myself, "Oh, my. This
is the beginning of a very long shoot."

305
00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.778
-Peter, everybody's moving on "action."
-I'll be right back.

306
00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.556
MAN:
Rupert, go to your left.

307
00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:53.492
Other left.

308
00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.695
COLUMBUS: I don't think any of the kids
will disagree with me...

309
00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:58.111
...when I say that they were extremely
inexperienced...

310
00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.585
...in terms of being on a film set
and doing film acting.

311
00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.760
LINDSAY -STEWART: They had to cast
a lot of children for Harry Potter 1...

312
00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:07.750
...and Chris and David were just
as meticulous casting for students...

313
00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:09.589
...as the other roles.

314
00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:13.424
One of the great things
was when auditioning the children...

315
00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.616
...you didn't have to
explain the characters...

316
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.297
...because they knew them
better than I did.

317
00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.616
LEWIS:
I was just such a fan of the story.

318
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.229
I wanted to dress up like a wizard...

319
00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.530
...I wanted to go to Hogwarts
and I knew the best way would be...

320
00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.190
...to get a part in the film.

321
00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:28.306
And it was nothing to do
with my career at the time.

322
00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.382
It was just a little boy wanting to be
in Harry Potter.

323
00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:36.279
When I first started, we shot a scene
where Neville's broomstick takes off--

324
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.673
I had read it in the script but--
I don't know.

325
00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:42.095
I had no idea what to expect, you know?
I'd never done anything like that.

326
00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:43.863
COLUMBUS:
Hold on. Start at the beginning.

327
00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.133
Still rolling, switch your hands.

328
00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:46.982
Matt, right.
Remember, look to your right.

329
00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.249
Look down. Be really scared and hover.

330
00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.079
LEWIS:
To come have Stunt Department...

331
00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.942
...put you in a harness,
strap you to a broomstick...

332
00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.277
...flying around on this
roller-coaster-type thing.

333
00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:56.619
COLUMBUS:
Cut.

334
00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:58.593
And they call it work. It was--
It was brilliant.

335
00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:03.005
All right. Shooting the plate.
Please, stay back.

336
00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.461
ENOCH: I remember the first time
when we went on location.

337
00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:08.156
I think it was to Alnwick.
And we were awful.

338
00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:11.029
That's what I've gotta think.
We were messing around all the time.

339
00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.761
Aah. Help me.

340
00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.584
ENOCH: Just imagine having
a massive group of 11-year-old kids...

341
00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.821
...running about,
trying to keep them controlled.

342
00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.937
And I feel bad for all the people.
They're trying to make a film.

343
00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.790
We thought we're on a holiday camp.
We were having a great time.

344
00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.953
MAN 1: Okay.
MAN 2: All right, checking eight.

345
00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:31.184
ENOCH: My great lament is that we
don't really do many locations anymore.

346
00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.741
CRAIG: There's a great deal more location
in Harry Potter 1 and Harry Potter 2...

347
00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.637
...than there isin 4, 5, 6, and 7.

348
00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:41.102
That's because, in the beginning,
the time we were given...

349
00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:43.984
...we couldn't possibly build all this.

350
00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.687
The first person hired was Stuart Craig.

351
00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:50.061
Because this world had to be created.

352
00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:53.473
CRAIG:
Honestly, your first reaction is fear.

353
00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:58.859
I thought, "Oh, my God.
How can I possibly do this, really?"

354
00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:01.000
COLUMBUS:
Starting with Stuart Craig...

355
00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.898
...was one of the best decisions
that we made on those pictures.

356
00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.373
And Stuart's just a genius.

357
00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:09.639
He really has brought Hogwarts
and Jo's universe to life.

358
00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:11.862
It is his creation.

359
00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.937
When we first began this
whole series of films, Harry Potter 1...

360
00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:18.006
...we met Jo Rowling...

361
00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:22.161
...and had loads of questions,
masses of questions to ask.

362
00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:27.613
And this was in fact her layout, drawn
at a hotel dining table, of Hogwarts.

363
00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.642
All the major ingredients,
the Dark Forest you see there...

364
00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:34.522
...the castle, the Quidditch pitch,
the Black Lake, Hogsmeade.

365
00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.254
Everything is on there,
the complete world.

366
00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.575
Without that little hand-drawn map...

367
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.049
...I would never have got to grips
with it in the way that we did.

368
00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.353
It was-- It was the most terrific gift.

369
00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:51.140
Boom! Goes up, up, and then
back down, Back over here--

370
00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:54.566
You're going too far up that way.
Okay, cut.

371
00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.105
COLUMBUS: Everyone working
on the film was committed...

372
00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:59.585
...to finding a way
to make the material...

373
00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:04.602
...not only cinematic but also a magical,
faithful retelling of the first book.

374
00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:09.559
Hand out, Dan. Freeze in that position.
Sean, same with you, don't move.

375
00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.327
And action.

376
00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.495
COLUMBUS: David Heyman
was a wonderful collaborator...

377
00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.240
...and very passionate about the film.

378
00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.841
I think that's why David and I
got along so well.

379
00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.438
There was nothing else in our minds
except making a great film.

380
00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.037
HEYMAN:
Chris was incredibly good to me.

381
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.471
I think he respected my passion
for the material.

382
00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.524
He respected that I was there
before anybody...

383
00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.480
...he respected that Jo and I
had a very good relationship.

384
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.504
But there are many people in his position
who would've cast me aside.

385
00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:39.733
At that time I was a young producer
and what the director said went.

386
00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:41.549
Chris wasn't having any of that.

387
00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.542
Not only did he keep me around
but he was very supportive...

388
00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:46.821
...and I learned an awful lot from him.

389
00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.105
COLUMBUS:
Cut.

390
00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:50.010
David and I had the same vision
for the films.

391
00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:53.097
And that vision being that the first film...

392
00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.473
...was more of this wonderful
sort of rich version of Hogwarts...

393
00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:59.105
...this storybook world
that we were creating.

394
00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:00.925
Then as we got into
Chamber of Secrets...

395
00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:03.135
...the facade starts to chip away
a little bit...

396
00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.619
...and we got darker with each film.

397
00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.777
CRAIG: That question of what is
this world, what does it look like...

398
00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.243
...you always start with the novel...

399
00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.695
...because J.K. Rowling talks about
the great antiquity of the world.

400
00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:17.738
I immediately thought,
"Where would you go on location?

401
00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.776
What exists from that era?"

402
00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.925
Well, there are bits of Oxford and bits
of Cambridge, some of those colleges.

403
00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:26.817
And also a bit of great Gothic
European cathedrals.

404
00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:30.159
COLUMBUS: We were able to go
to various churches...

405
00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:34.042
...and universities throughout England
and create the whole world.

406
00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:38.571
CRAIG: The creating of the castle
carried with it this inherent problem...

407
00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:43.205
...of mixing real locations with bits
that we had designed.

408
00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:47.914
Given that real locations
are often disappointing.

409
00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:52.890
They're full of bits that don't quite fit
the story that you're trying to tell.

410
00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:58.487
So it's the blending of these two worlds.
And I found that very difficult.

411
00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.790
And I think, in some respects,
I have to say, we failed.

412
00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:07.184
And I'm thinking specifically
of the exterior of Hogwarts.

413
00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:09.376
When it was all put together...

414
00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:15.164
...it didn't amount
to a really successful iconic silhouette...

415
00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:18.560
...which is you want it to work
on this kind of simple level.

416
00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:22.308
What has happened since then
on all the subsequent movies...

417
00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:26.276
...we have slowly improved
the silhouette of those things.

418
00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:29.059
We've taken away
some of the real locations.

419
00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:32.182
Alnwick was a featured part in 7.
There's less--

420
00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:35.314
So it was Stuart who's reshaped
and rebuilt Hogwarts...

421
00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:40.442
...as the films have developed
to become more to his liking, I think.

422
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.357
COLUMBUS: Rupert, hold your head up.
Dan, eyes a little wider.

423
00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.199
-"He's gone?" Look to them.
RADCLIFFE: Yeah.

424
00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:49.349
"This is about the Sorcerer's Stone."
Just a little faster. Head up. Eyes wider.

425
00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.895
She just told you he's gone. Action.

426
00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.982
RADCLIFFE:
He's gone? This-- But this is important.

427
00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:59.343
Once more. You gotta look to them.
"He's gone?" Head up. Head up.

428
00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.600
COLUMBUS:
In the early days I had to find a way...

429
00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:06.169
...wrangling these kids
to deliver some sort of performance...

430
00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.649
...because they couldn't have been
any greener.

431
00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.494
Chris, I need to go to the bathroom.

432
00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.530
WATSON:
It's a lot harder than everyone thinks.

433
00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:17.072
And there are 50 billion, trillion, million
things going on at the same time...

434
00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:18.863
...that you have to think about.

435
00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.079
Like hitting your marks,
getting your line right at the right time...

436
00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:25.689
...making sure you step into the light
so that the face doesn't shadow you...

437
00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.179
...all that kind of stuff.

438
00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:30.279
He's gone? Now? But this is important!

439
00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.679
This is about the Philosopher's Stone.

440
00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.674
COLUMBUS:
Okay. Still rolling. Hold your head up.

441
00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:38.708
When you find out that he's gone, this
is the worst thing that could happen.

442
00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.139
That means you're dead.

443
00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.756
MARK: In the first movie,
I always, you know, laughed and said:

444
00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.389
"We should put a camera on Chris."

445
00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.609
Because what the kids'
performance was...

446
00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:49.356
...was a reflection of what he was doing
and bringing out.

447
00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:54.010
Stronger. "He's gone.
But this is important." Set and:

448
00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:55.909
RADCLIFFE:
Should we go from, "He's gone"?

449
00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.389
Yeah. And action.

450
00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:00.064
HARRY:
He's gone? But this is important!

451
00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:03.154
This is about the Sorcerer's Stone.

452
00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.921
Don't take a pause between "this is
about" and "the Sorcerer's Stone."

453
00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.279
-Eyes wide. Stronger. Action.
HARRY: He's gone?

454
00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:12.047
HEYMAN:
Chris was so wonderful with them.

455
00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:14.409
He often had to, "Chin up, Dan."

456
00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:16.444
Head up, Dan. Head up, even higher.

457
00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.831
-"Rupert, stop smiling."
-No, do not smile.

458
00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:20.258
"Emma, look this way."

459
00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:23.086
You guys should look at each other
after, "He's gone?" Okay?

460
00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:26.718
Somebody said that the difference
between children and children on a set...

461
00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:30.403
...is that children on a set actually do
do what you tell them to do.

462
00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.788
HARRY: That was no stranger
Hagrid met. It was Snape.

463
00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:37.732
Which means he knows
how to get past Fluffy.

464
00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.550
-And with Dumbledore gone--
-Good afternoon.

465
00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.498
Alan Rickman was so fantastic,
I was freaked.

466
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.650
You ought to be careful.

467
00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:49.231
People will think you're...

468
00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:52.480
...up to something.

469
00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.803
I was constantly having to remind myself
that it was:

470
00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:58.073
"It's only a film, it's only a film,
it's only a film. Nothing's real."

471
00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:00.631
But it was terrifying.

472
00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.661
[COLUMBUS LAUGHING]

473
00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:05.619
It is great.

474
00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:08.264
COLUMBUS:
Alan Rickman to me was always Snape...

475
00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.649
...because Jo Rowling showed me
some early drawings.

476
00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:14.163
She'd done the sketch of Snape
and looked just like Alan Rickman.

477
00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.433
He was a little reluctant
because he's done...

478
00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.558
...this particular type of villain
in the past...

479
00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:21.019
...so he didn't wanna be typecast
as this villain.

480
00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:25.098
So David and I took Alan to dinner
to convince him he had to play the role.

481
00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:28.286
And I remember the car ride
through London with David driving...

482
00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.394
...with Alan sitting in the front seat
and me sitting in the back...

483
00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.422
...and David almost got
in a car accident.

484
00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:37.486
And I remember saying, "David,
don't kill us before Alan says, 'No.""

485
00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:40.185
You know, because we just
expected him to say no.

486
00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:43.308
But for some reason, two days later
he came back and said yes.

487
00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.730
I don't think I had much choice
in the matter.

488
00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:52.254
Lots of godchildren, nephews and nieces
were not only excited, I think insistent.

He knows how to get past Fluffy.

When you see this movie...

492
00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.574
...you're not going to see
all of these huge mechanics...

493
00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:03.292
...and the months of editing...

494
00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:07.674
...you're just going to watch a close-up
on two little boys and a little girl's face...

495
00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:12.331
...at the center of the story and
unless that reads the film won't work.

doing that scene, keep your head up.

don't put your head up forward. Action.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:22.446
COLUMBUS: A problem in the early days
and the problem all the kids had...

500
00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.691
...was this sense of total delight
at being there...

501
00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:28.584
...so they could never stop smiling
even if it was a serious scene.

have this giggling problem.

504
00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:35.821
And I remember Alan Rickman, in the
first one, told me to relax my face...

505
00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:37.760
...and just not think of anything.

506
00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:39.929

507
00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:43.479
GRINT: Sorry. Sorry.
COLUMBUS: Cut.

508
00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:47.442
It didn't really work, to be honest.
But yeah, he tried.

509
00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:50.886
MAN 1: Take 10. A camera.
MAN 2: B camera.

510
00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:52.652
MAN 3:
C camera.

511
00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.521
-All right. Set.
COLUMBUS: Set and action.

512
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.139
MARK:
In the early days you might do 10 takes.

513
00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.910
You might be lucky
to get the one you really wanted once.

514
00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.756
COLUMBUS: Cut. Emma.
WATSON: What? What did I do?

515
00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:06.197
Then they might go off to school
and you might not get it.

516
00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:09.559
So definitely we would run
three and four cameras.

517
00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:12.077
-A camera.
COLUMBUS: Okay, guys.

518
00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:15.535
I don't want you to seem as if
you know she's coming, okay?

519
00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.714
-Keep reading. Dan, are you reading?
RADCLIFFE: Yeah.

520
00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:21.868
It was important for me to
always have a camera on one of them...

521
00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:25.102
...in case one of them was coming down
off of a chocolate rush...

522
00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.449
...or they lost their energy
or were getting tired...

523
00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.269
...or were looking into the camera.
There were a million things going on.

524
00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:31.875
COLUMBUS:
And, guys, you're interested.

525
00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.520
Rupert, you shouldn't be laughing...

526
00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:36.338
...when you find out that Dan's
gonna potentially be killed by Snape.

527
00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.229
And the key was,
for cinematographer, John Seale...

528
00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:41.085
...was shooting multiple cameras...

529
00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:44.916
...because I never knew
when the kids were going to deliver...

530
00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:46.709
...the performance that I needed.

531
00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:49.959
-The Sorcerer's Stone.
COLUMBUS: Guys, you're laughing.

532
00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:54.937
So if you look at the first film
you'd see it's very cutty.

533
00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:59.599
In other words we cut to a close-up of a
kid and then I cut away to someone else.

534
00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:02.982
We were incapable
of getting an entire scene in context.

535
00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:07.024
So John's philosophy of shooting
three cameras basically helped me...

536
00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.671
...to obtain a performance here
and a performance here...

537
00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:12.646
...unlike any other way I'd shoot a
movie, it's almost documentary-style.

538
00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:14.969
And John really knew how to do that.

539
00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:16.868
And I had always admired his work...

540
00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:20.187
...and this was a really golden
opportunity for me to work with him.

541
00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:21.659
COLUMBUS:
And action.

542
00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:24.304
The overall look
that Chris and I talked about...

543
00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.791
...was retaining a magic of Hogwarts.

544
00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:29.379
And then, of course,
the adventures within it.

545
00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.042
We wanted the drama
that is written into the books.

546
00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:33.521
We didn't want to lose that.

547
00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:36.252
We didn't want to make it
too sort of glossy and open.

548
00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:38.877
So it was a very delicate balance...

549
00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:42.540
...between making it a reality film
and a magical film.

550
00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:44.343
And I hope we've done it.

551
00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.315

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:53.859
Listen to everything she says.

555
00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:55.549
COLUMBUS:
What we needed from McGonagall...

556
00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:57.132
...was someone
that you were intimidated by...

557
00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.869
...but someone who had a real sense
of warmth and heart.

558
00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:02.078
And that's exactly who Maggie is.

559
00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:04.016
I thought,
"This is perfect for McGonagall."

560
00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:05.755
And move, Maggie.

561
00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:07.229
You meet her in the beginning...

562
00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:09.904
...where they're walking up
the stairs, she was intimidating.

563
00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:11.908
I mean, she was intimidating to
the crew...

564
00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:13.850
...because she's so smart,
she's so brilliant.

565
00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.049
And the kids could sense that.
But that was good.

566
00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:18.256
At that point she was the disciplinarian.

567
00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:21.069
Everybody should be looking at her,
in awe of her.

568
00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:23.210
MAKOVSKY:
I have to say, a lot of good ideas...

569
00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.739
...came from Dame Maggie
from our first fitting.

570
00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:29.386
She wanted to be Scottish.
Her name is Scottish.

571
00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:35.502
So the whole idea of making her
witch's hat more like a Scottish tam...

572
00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:39.064
...that was actually her idea.
She had some great ideas.

COLUMBUS:
Set. Action.

574
00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:46.554
MAKOVSKY: I tried to keep all the kids
really classically British boarding school.

575
00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:51.069
Funnily enough, J.K. Rowling said
that the kids did not wear uniforms.

576
00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:55.867
So we ended up testing Daniel
in regular clothes...

577
00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:58.409
...with a wizard gown and uniforms...

578
00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:01.741

because graphically it was much prettier.

for less of a contemporary look...

And everyone was talking about it.

601
00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:05.998

that one of the things they asked was:

602
00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:07.970
"What is your favorite scene
in the book?"

603
00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:10.601
There was a row of us about seven of us
and, of course...

604
00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:12.263
...I haven't read it, so I just--

605
00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:14.739
The guy next to me said,
"Oh, Gringotts, I love the trolls."

606
00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:18.318
So I just said, "Yeah, same as this guy,
I love the trolls. They're brilliant."

607
00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:21.230
And then straightaway
Chris saw straight through that.

608
00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:25.156
And I'm pretty sure that gave him a little
internal laugh so that could've helped.

when we were trying to find:

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:35.094
Let me put some makeup on him
and put a scar on him and a black wig...

612
00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.017
...see if he could do Harry Potter."

613
00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:40.091
So we tested Tom as Harry Potter
in that succession of screen tests...

614
00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:44.110
...but we realized after the screen test
we felt he was better for Draco Malfoy.

That was quite scary at first...

...because there were quite a lot of
people who've worked with him before.

631

And Richard, by the way,
is my godfather.

My father used to be his agent.
He was his best friend.

636

So Richard was a very significant
part of my life growing up.

a real character...

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:13.893
I must admit...

646
00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.123
...it took me months to say yes to it.

647
00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.346
I wasn't necessarily very keen
on doing it.

648
00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:21.149
What really sold it was not me.

649
00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:24.559
I wish I could claim such power
but, no, it wasn't me.

650
00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:29.011
It was the fact that his granddaughter,
Ella, read the books.

651
00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:31.882
My granddaughter called me
and said, "Papa," she said:

652
00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:36.046
"If you don't play Dumbledore,
I will never speak to you again."

653
00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:38.763
And I said, "Okay, I'll do it. I'll do it."

654
00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:40.634
She's wrapped up in it.

655
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.786
You know, and I love the book,
I love the script.

656
00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:46.101
It's beautifully written
and beautiful dialogue in it.

657
00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:48.569
I see that you, like many before you...

658
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.402
...have discovered the delights
of the Mirror of Erised.

659
00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:54.018
HEYMAN:
In hiring a writer...

660
00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:58.564
...we wanted somebody who could
capture the spirit of Jo's writing.

661
00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:01.414
And so I sent the book out
to a few writers.

662
00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.998
But I had around-- I can't remember,
seven first editions...

663
00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:07.273
...of Harry Potter
and the Philosopher's Stone...

664
00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:10.798
...which I sent out to many writers
who passed on it.

665
00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.494
Each one of those books
is worth like $25,000 now...

666
00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:17.510
...so the screenwriters who didn't do
the book ended up getting paid anyway.

667
00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:19.730
We hired Steve Kloves...

668
00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:22.043
...who at the time I suppose
was an unusual choice...

669
00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:26.724
...in as much as he had never written
any family adventures as it were.

670
00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:31.121
But he was a writer who I loved...

671
00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:34.360
...and who was brilliant at adaptation.

672
00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:36.981
KLOVES: Writing Harry Potter
and the Philosopher's Stone...

673
00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.812
...is probably the most challenging thing
I've ever done because you--

674
00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:43.199
People are so familiar with the book...

675
00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:46.414
...and feel so connected to it
that you want to--

676
00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:48.553
You don't want them to feel cheated
in any way.

677
00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:51.554
Jo Rowling, Steve Kloves,
David Heyman and myself...

678
00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:53.650
...worked on that script together a lot.

679
00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:58.290
HEYMAN: We sat and went through
the script page by page by page.

680
00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:04.797
And slowly the film that Chris
ultimately made began to take shape.

681
00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:08.809
Jo Rowling has probably
been my greatest asset...

682
00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:10.583
...because from the beginning...

683
00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:13.480
...she was extremely supportive
and understanding...

684
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.115
...of what I was dealing with.

685
00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:18.808
And, you know, over the course
of about a year and a half...

686
00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:21.010
...we've e-mailed each other
back and forth.

687
00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:23.357
She's made herself available...

688
00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:27.020
...and extremely generous with her time
in answering my questions.

689
00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:29.819
You know,
she's driven me crazy at times...

690
00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:31.816
...because since this is
a series of books...

691
00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:34.191
...you know, a familiar refrain became:

692
00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:36.956
"l can't tell you that because
that's gonna happen in book seven."

693
00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:39.363
But she would tell me
when I was on the right path.

694
00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:41.586
I think when we were making
the first film...

695
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.959
...she showed us in manuscript form
the fourth book.

696
00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:48.535
And she just-- You know, she gave it--

697
00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:51.759
I know she gave it to Steve, and Steve
then took it on the plane and he realized:

698
00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:56.598
"Oh, my goodness.
Here I am carrying this-- Wha--?"

699
00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:59.522
I think he was really nervous.

700
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.254
Here's Steve on the first--
The Mandarin Hotel.

701
00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:05.479
Looking much younger
than he does now.

702
00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:08.673
And that's Chris on the phone back there
and that was the first--

703
00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:11.746
Yeah, that was the first--

704
00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:15.107
God, Steve does look younger.
I'm gonna show him this later on today.

705
00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:18.069
We're still working on the script
for Harry 7: Part Il.

706
00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:20.327
COLUMBUS:
I'm delivering the line...

707
00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:22.210
...and it'll be
at those guys in the top row, okay?

708
00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:23.920
WOMAN:
Okay.

709
00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:26.709
And Mr. Harry Potter has his key?

710
00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:28.986
DAVIS: In the first film,
I particularly remember...

711
00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.799
...the scene where Dan
has to come up...

712
00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:35.370
...wanting access to his vault and Chris
wanted Dan to kind of look shocked.

713
00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:37.690
Dan, when you first walk in,
you kind of--

714
00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:40.003
That thing really scares you
when you first enter frame.

715
00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:41.527
Set and action!

716
00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:44.019
DAVIS: But Dan really was not fazed
by anything.

717
00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:48.269
So Chris said to me, "On the next take,
when you lean over, make him jump."

718
00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:51.349
GOBLIN: Look me in the eye
when I'm talking to you!

719
00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:55.839
-Does Mr. Harry Potter have his key?
COLUMBUS: Okay, cut.

720
00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.118
DAVIS:
It did not have the desired effect at all.

721
00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:00.022
He just burst out laughing.

722
00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.391
[ALL LAUGHING]

723
00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:05.087
COLUMBUS: I told you,
one or the other would happen.

724
00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:07.619
MAN: Off you go.
COLUMBUS: Day 27, it all fell apart.

725
00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:09.684
All right. Well, we tried.

726
00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:12.219
I was made to look very different
as the bank teller.

727
00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:16.469
Big ears, the nose, the spectacles,
the teeth, contact lenses.

728
00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:19.151
So as that character,
there was nothing of Warwick left.

729
00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:22.683
And Nick Dudman and the Makeup
Effects Department took care of that.

730
00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:25.089
The challenge on the Patter films...

731
00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:27.443
...was very definitely the goblins.

732
00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:29.450
The trouble with something
like goblins...

733
00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:32.406
...most of the designs you look at
have been done.

734
00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:34.354
If you say "No, it's got to look new"...

735
00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:36.324
...you find the avenues
you're going down...

736
00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:38.438
...get narrower and narrower
and narrower.

737
00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:42.703
So in the end, we decided
the most important thing was character.

738
00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.562
Make each of these
an interesting character...

739
00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:48.281
...and goblinize that character.

740
00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:51.354
So that there isn't
a set look for goblins...

741
00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:54.440
...any more than there's a set look
for human beings.

742
00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:57.372
We then decided we would do
all the pieces in silicone...

743
00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:59.348
...but it was a bit of a gamble.

744
00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:02.940
Silicone at that point was still pretty iffy,
there were a lot of questions about it...

745
00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:06.780
...chemically, that I wasn't totally
convinced by at that point.

746
00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:10.654
Now it's very much a production line,
very straightforward and lovely.

747
00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:13.574
But this was one of the first occasions
where we're using it.

748
00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:15.195
There were moments we're going:

749
00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:17.193
"Why isn't this setting?
Why isn't this working?"

750
00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:20.240
But we cracked it and we learned a lot.

751
00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:22.854
I was very pleased
with the way the goblins worked out...

752
00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:25.630
...because the way they were shot,
the way the sequence was done...

753
00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:27.656
...was very complementary to the work.

754
00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:30.685
Hagrid...

755
00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:33.000
...what exactly are these things?

756
00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:36.366
COLUMBUS: Okay, so he says his line,
you throw him in the cupboard...

757
00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:39.087
...lock the door, and then you
go down to that bar-- The bars.

758
00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:40.925
GRIFFITHS:
There is no such thing as magic.

759
00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.509
-"There is no such thing as magic."

760
00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:44.530
CRAIG:
Chris Columbus was very interested...

761
00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:48.390
...in the idea of the misery
of Harry's situation.

762
00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:51.668
HARRY:
It was like magic.

763
00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:57.353
There's no such thing as magic.

764
00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:00.548
CRAIG: The cupboard under the stairs
seemed all the more desperate...

765
00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:04.820
...if he was in a huge urban sprawl...

766
00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:09.235
...and the best and most graphic way
to illustrate that huge urban sprawl...

767
00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:12.332
...was identical, modern houses.

768
00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:14.205
MAN:
Bird, bird!

769
00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:18.064
COLUMBUS: Privet Drive had to feel
like this mean, awful place.

770
00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:21.030
And so we intentionally looked
for the place...

771
00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:24.319
...that felt like it would kill
any creativity or originality...

772
00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:26.803
...that anyone would ever have there.

773
00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:29.802
CRAIG: We shot for a while
on that real location...

774
00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:33.113
...and that really was difficult shooting
with owls flying around...

775
00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:38.971
...and it would rapidly prove to be a fairly
disastrous way to achieve that scene.

776
00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:41.905
We didn't finish on the location,
we came to the studio.

777
00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.818
We rebuilt those houses here.

778
00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:46.549
Exactly reproduced them.

779
00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.338
I think now there are five houses
on either side of the street.

780
00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:54.124
But it's extended in a matte painting,
limitlessly, you know, to the horizon.

781
00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:57.577
And that really was Chris' request...

782
00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:00.145
...that it be that big and that sprawling.

783
00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:05.302
And that set that we built then
has been standing for all seven movies.

784
00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:08.473
McMILLAN:
Privet Drive was fun to do.

785
00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:12.669
I remember we did spend some time
looking for the ugliest sofas...

786
00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:17.269
...the worst tiles for the kitchen
and lots of nasty pictures on the walls...

787
00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:22.090
...and lots of certificates
of Dudley's achievements...

788
00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:27.710
...like swimming a quarter of a width
in the swimming pool and things.

789
00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:30.949
They asked when I got the part...

790
00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:33.602
...if I could put--
You know, give my baby photos in.

791
00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:38.745
And I came in, I would see my whole
history in front me, like my first bike.

792
00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:41.619
And there was all these baby pictures
everywhere of me...

793
00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:43.730
...in this tacky house.

794
00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:47.067
You will drag him in by the ear,
and as you're being dragged in...

795
00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:50.234
...you're saying your line.
You know your line?

796
00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:53.726
You're not even listening. You're
thinking about whoopee cushions again.

797
00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:56.902
SHAW: The hardest thing early on
was trying to perform with the owls...

798
00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:59.642
...because the owls are not actors.

799
00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:01.793
There were some shots
where I had to look at an owl...

800
00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:03.736
...and an owl had to look at me.

801
00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:05.485
And the owls kept looking
at the cameras.

802
00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:06.818
The camera was coming around.

803
00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:08.906
So the owl thought
the camera was very interesting.

804
00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:11.209
It's more interested in the camera
than looking at me.

805
00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:15.326
So in the end we hung dead mice
from my apron...

806
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.162
...so the owls absolutely looked at me.

00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:51.905
And he'd really thought through
how he wanted to approach it.

946
00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:57.329
I think at that moment,
they probably realized...

947
00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:02.967
...that I was very, very serious about
making a great film out of this material.

948
00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:06.361
We met a lot of people and then--

949
00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:10.595
And ultimately,
it came down to studio comfort.

950
00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:15.103
And also it's the person who had
the most passion for the material.

And it was Chris Columbus...

and got the job.

who said:

"You're our guy.
We're gonna go with you."

955
00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:29.489
So it was an amazing mo--
It was an amazing moment.

956
00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:32.514
Because I remember walking into

"I got the job. I got the Patter gig.
We're moving to London."

His family lives in San Francisco.

...every Friday to San Francisco
and come back for Monday morning...

964
00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:02.618

him to spend the weekend with his kids.

00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:22.618
...which is amazing.

971
00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:24.815
RADCLIFFE: This is cool to walk on, huh?
GRINT: Yeah.

972
00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:28.011
RADCLIFFE: It's so great when it's lit up.
COLUMBUS: Set and, "There's the door."

973
00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:31.188
Probably my favorite example
of Stuart Craig's production design...

974
00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:33.677
...was the gigantic chess set.

975
00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:37.312
I just love the attention to detail...

976
00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:39.496
...and the look of those pieces.

977
00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:42.440
I mean, they looked
as if they were made out of real stone.

978
00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:44.701
I wanted to take all of them
back home to--

979
00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:47.885
For my office in San Francisco
because they're just stunning.

980
00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:51.034
Now, don't be offended or anything...

981
00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:54.996
...but neither of you
are particularly good at chess.

982
00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:56.579
COLUMBUS:
Okay, good.

983
00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:57.745
RADCLIFFE:
Yeah, you loser.

984
00:47:58.040 --> 00:47:59.292
COLUMBUS:
All right, try it one more time.

985
00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:02.405
COLUMBUS: It was also one
of my favorite scenes in the book...

986
00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:05.167
...and the film
because Ron actually sacrifices himself.

987
00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:07.495
HARRY:
Just tell us what to do.

988
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:08.933
RON:
All right, then.

989
00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:11.738
Harry, you take
the empty bishop's square.

990
00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:16.279
And Hermione,
you'll be the queen-side horse.

991
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.662
And as for me, I'll be a knight.

992
00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:23.704
That's Ron's kind of moment and he--
It's the first time he really takes charge.

993
00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:26.601
And he gets to ride this great big horse.

994
00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:29.105
That was really exciting
because I got to sit on the horse.

995
00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:31.369
So I remember really enjoying that.

996
00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:34.144
Actually the coolest thing about it
was when the pieces got smashed.

997
00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:35.618
They actually exploded.

998
00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:42.209
I think I actually still got
a broken piece of the--

999
00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:44.449
I think it was the horse. That was cool.

1000
00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:46.450
-Very well, once this--
COLUMBUS: Can I walk--?

1001
00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:48.649
Let me walk it with them once.

1002
00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:51.606
That was certainly one of my favorite
scenes to shoot in the picture...

1003
00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:54.817
...because it was just
beautifully designed by Stuart Craig...

1004
00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:57.749
...and beautifully lit by John Seale.

1005
00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:02.131
Once I make my move,
the queen will take me.

1006
00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:05.374
Then you're free to check the king.

1007
00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:08.229
Rupert was so strong in that--
In that moment.

1008
00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:11.599
RON: Harry, you take
the empty bishop's square.

1009
00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:15.061
COLUMBUS: We shot that as we were
getting closer to the end of the picture.

1010
00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:16.539
And at that time...

1011
00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:19.150
...the kids were really starting
to come into their own as actors...

1012
00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:22.274
...and the kids delivered
just wonderful performances there.

1013
00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:25.749
Just tell us what to do then.

1014
00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:29.432
COLUMBUS: Rehearsing and action.
MAN: Action!

1015
00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:34.730
HARRY: I still need a wand.
HAGRID: A wand?

1016
00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:37.938
You want Ollivanders.
There ain't no place better.

1017
00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:40.829
We all felt that Diagon Alley
should look like a Dickensian world.

1018
00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:43.709
So that was a bit of a challenge
because you'll think:

1019
00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:46.544
"Is there anywhere in London
where we can shoot Diagon Alley?"

1020
00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:50.380
Well, the reality is that world
that we think still exists somewhere...

1021
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.697
...there's very few places look like that
and if they do look like that...

1022
00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:55.913
...there's always a phone shop...

1023
00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:59.221
...or something modern
or a grocery store that really--

1024
00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:02.497
That you can fix but
you can't really re-create it completely.

1025
00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:06.335
So we'd realize we'd have to build it
and Stuart built it in a way...

1026
00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:09.339
...that had a sense of forced perspective
about it.

1027
00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:11.825
So it appears to go on forever.

1028
00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:14.021
As you can see the street ends
in a green screen.

1029
00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:17.802
So in the book,
your impression is of a much longer...

1030
00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:19.839
...much more complicated street.

1031
00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:24.615
For the scenes that we have to shoot,
this is sufficient.

1032
00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:27.437
It's a great challenge in the detail
and as you can see...

1033
00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:30.679
...there aren't any vertical lines in it
whatsoever.

1034
00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:33.143
MAKOVSKY:
Getting it just right...

1035
00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:36.632
...so it looked like a Dickensian street,
I think that was the hardest challenge.

1036
00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:40.661
McMILLAN: I had an absolutely
obsessive assistant on the first film...

1037
00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:43.237
...one who was deeply into Harry Potter.

1038
00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:46.934
And she masterminded Diagon Alley
with everything cataloged.

1039
00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:52.191
And we took all the names from the
book and just sort of expanded them.

1040
00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:55.219
Oh, Jenny, do you wanna do
the upstairs bit as well?

1041
00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:57.353
MAKOVSKY: One of the things
you don't see in the movie...

1042
00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:01.685
...each shop had a shopkeeper
that looked like they match their shops.

1043
00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:05.552
So there was a wizard apothecary,
there was a wizard candy maker.

1044
00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:08.021
And when you saw these characters
all dressed up...

1045
00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:09.839
...in the first day of Diagon Alley...

1046
00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:13.147
...with Stuart's set and all the props
and the set dressing...

1047
00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:15.882
...everybody had big smiles
on their faces that day.

1048
00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:19.302
-John, good view here?
SEALE: Yep. Right there is excellent.

1049
00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:21.831
Come up here, you turn,
then you look up.

1050
00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:24.089
It was a very, very magical place
to shoot.

1051
00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:26.932
You're scared of taking that wand.
I wanna see some real fear.

1052
00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:28.555
Set and action.

1053
00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:32.180
CRAIG: I think Ollivanders wand shop
has a nice feeling about it...

1054
00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:33.778
...has a nice character.

1055
00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:35.866
I think it is dense and detailed...

1056
00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:39.602
...and I think John Hurt's appearance
on that moving ladder...

1057
00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:41.930
...was a good, simple idea.

1058
00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:43.856
Hello?

1059
00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:48.912
He comes and arrives on the trolley
up with the bookshelves...

1060
00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:51.056
...into center-- Top of the screen.

1061
00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:54.034
And it was a sensational shot,
you could--

1062
00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:57.678
No actor could ask
for a much better entrance.

1063
00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:01.716
I wondered when
I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter.

1064
00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:05.047
RADCLIFFE: J.K. Rowling came down
to Diagon Alley...

1065
00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:08.740
...when we were filming that
to have a look at all the sets...

1066
00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:10.725
...and she's really nice.

1067
00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:13.949
McMILLAN:
When she came to visit Diagon Alley...

1068
00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:17.529
...I was told that she literally had
a sort of tear in her eye...

1069
00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:21.556
...because she couldn't believe how
it was what she had in her imagination.

1070
00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:25.396
He's so clever.

1071
00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:28.209
COLUMBUS: If I use the beginning
of one shot and the end of another--

1072
00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:30.597
MAN: Set, Chris.
-Set and action.

1073
00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:34.340
RADCLIFFE: If you took a million people
and J.K. Rowling was one of them...

1074
00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:37.861
...then she'd probably be the only one
of those people to think up Quidditch.

1075
00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:39.760
But-- And when I read it...

1076
00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:42.282
...I'm like, "Oh, that is so cool,
I wish I'd thought of that."

1077
00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:44.167
So it doesn't really matter.

1078
00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:47.040
If I use the beginning of take one
and the end of take four, it's okay.

1079
00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:48.743
COLUMBUS:
Quidditch was a challenge...

1080
00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:50.650
...because I was being introduced
to a new sport.

1081
00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:53.316
So I really wanted
to fundamentally understand...

1082
00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:54.778
...how Quidditch works.

1083
00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:57.174
It's a lot of hours spent
with Jo Rowling...

1084
00:52:57.640 --> 00:52:59.426
...understanding the rules,
writing down the rules.

1085
00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:02.002
I have notebooks
filled with Quidditch rules.

1086
00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:04.756
And the other challenge
was making those rules...

1087
00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:07.442
...accessible and understandable
for an audience as well.

1088
00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:11.544
And then the visual demands
of making Quidditch real...

1089
00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:15.820
...were very difficult because
of the time constraint we were under...

1090
00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:19.455
...and because the sets where some of
the visual effects needed to take place...

1091
00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:21.081
...couldn't be built in time.

1092
00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:23.858
Some of those sequences were pushed
toward the end of our schedule...

1093
00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:25.862
...and as we were doing them,
we realized...

1094
00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:28.556
...that we would have far less time
in postproduction...

1095
00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:31.424
...to create visual effects
that we would all be happy with.

1096
00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:33.035
This was a very unusual film.

1097
00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:34.725
I think we shot for about nine months.

1098
00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:37.321
So even though they'd finished
the main unit's shooting...

1099
00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:39.962
...the Quidditch match
was a completely separate unit...

1100
00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:42.642
...that was filming pretty much
right up until the end.

1101
00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:44.485
LEGATO:
We were behind the eight ball...

1102
00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:47.713
...because we didn't start shooting until
June and it had to be finished in October.

1103
00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:50.021
So, what we did
was to make a cartoon animation...

1104
00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:53.984
...of the entire Quidditch match
prior to actually photographing.

1105
00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:56.984
And then we'd in go and say,
"Okay, we're photographing this shot...

1106
00:53:57.480 --> 00:54:00.632
...that fits into this hole exactly."
So the hard part or the daunting part...

1107
00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:03.868
...is actually creating a scene
and have it cut...

1108
00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:07.279
...before you actually start shooting it.
And we've never done it before.

1109
00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:10.673
Now it's fairly easy to even preview it
and previs it...

1110
00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:13.237
...and do all the stuff we did,
but back then it wasn't.

1111
00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:17.795
COLUMBUS:
I have to say that this...

1112
00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:19.838
...is one of the scenes
in the film I love seeing...

1113
00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:23.119
...but one of the scenes that I know
if I could go back and do it again...

1114
00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:26.160
...I would love to go back
and do it again. Because I would do it--

1115
00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:28.398
I would spend so much more time--

1116
00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:29.983
I would give myself more time...

1117
00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:32.106
...to do the visual effects
the way they should be done.

1118
00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:34.268
Gryffindor wins!

1119
00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:40.439
It's rare to shoot a film in sequence,
and that can cause problems, you know?

1120
00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:43.083
Especially with young kids
who grow up rather quickly.

1121
00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:45.250
And if you are really alert...

1122
00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:47.774
...you can see the difference
in Daniel Radcliffe.

1123
00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:49.981
And he looks older in this scene
to that scene.

1124
00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:51.629
And of course,
what was making it worse...

1125
00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:53.815
...is Daniel's voice
was getting deeper each day.

1126
00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:56.545
We're not allowed to do magic
away from Hogwarts.

1127
00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.297
I'm Harry. Harry Potter.

1128
00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:00.176
COLUMBUS:
The pressure really was a combination...

1129
00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:02.801
...of postproduction and preproduction
on Chamber of Secrets...

1130
00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:05.021
...overlapping those two things...

1131
00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:07.960
...because Harry Potter's all about
beating the clock to a certain level.

1132
00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:11.802
Because you didn't wanna wait another
year to start Chamber of Secrets...

1133
00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:15.632
...because the kids age so quickly
that they'd be too old for their roles...

1134
00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:17.310
...in that particular book.

1135
00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:21.349
So the challenge was really devoting
enough of my time to preproduction...

1136
00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:25.766
...and still being able to edit a version
of the first film...

1137
00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:28.898
...that we were all happy with,
that was under three and a half hours.

1138
00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:32.209
WILLIAMS:
Orchestra, look at seven, please.

1139
00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:35.401
I need you to stop it sooner
with the winds.

1140
00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:37.598
FRANCIS-BRUCE: The hardest part
about a postproduction...

1141
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:39.183
...of a movie of this scale...

1142
00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:42.114
...is that there's constantly changes
happening while in postproduction...

1143
00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:44.774
...while the sound crew
are already working on the sound.

1144
00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:48.363
Change it to one bar in this violin score.

1145
00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:51.486
Tell me how long.
Certainly for 41 and 2.

1146
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.059
It's a constantly changing relationship...

1147
00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:57.569
...between sound, music and visuals.

1148
00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:01.733
And very often, the best results
we only can anticipate...

1149
00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:04.880
...when we get all three elements
together, and we can see and hear it.

1150
00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:07.616
A-10-4, take 371.

1151
00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:13.627
FRANCIS-BRUCE: John will always take
an early and longer version of the cut...

1152
00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:15.133
...to work on.

1153
00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:17.329
And he'll just record
to the longer version.

1154
00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:22.459
I remember on one occasion,
we saw the cue played back...

1155
00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:25.521
...of this long version of the arrival
at Hogwarts...

1156
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.604
...and Chris just turned to me and said:

1157
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.207
"You gotta go and put that back
to that longer version."

1158
00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:32.887
Because we'd shortened it
because we thought it was too slow.

1159
00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:36.091
But once we saw it with the music,
it was brilliant.

1160
00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:48.802
What's beautiful about what John does
is he creates these moments...

1161
00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:53.173
...it might be six or seven notes
that you'll remember forever.

1162
00:56:57.360 --> 00:56:59.840
And those first moments
of the Harry Potter score...

1163
00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:02.840
...which are still being played
in the trailer to this day...

1164
00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:04.896
...it just-- You know
exactly where you are...

1165
00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:06.600
...you know exactly
what you're listening to.

1166
00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:09.891
So I feel very privileged to have had
that John Williams experience.

1167
00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:15.145
It's been a special joy for me,
particularly in the musical sense...

1168
00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:18.440
...that I can go perform
with symphony orchestras...

1169
00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:21.304
...seems anywhere in the world
we play material from Harry Potter...

1170
00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:24.110
...and people relate to it.

1171
00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:30.017
Good luck, Harry Potter.

1172
00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:33.120
COLUMBUS: I was of the mindset
that under the time constraints...

1173
00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:35.956
...I had delivered the best picture I could
at the time.

1174
00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:37.805
And I was anxiously awaiting--

1175
00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:40.185
I wasn't worried about the box office
as much...

1176
00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:42.881
...because, it being Harry Potter,
people were gonna show up...

1177
00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:45.636
...the question was,
were people gonna like it?

1178
00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:50.813
And that pressure was significant,
because I knew if I failed...

1179
00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:54.734
...if my vision for the film failed,
if the look of the picture failed...

1180
00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:58.409
...if the casting failed, all of those things
that I was responsible for...

1181
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:02.402
...if I was wrong about any of them,
the franchise was dead.

1182
00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:07.046
MAN: So, what are you most looking
forward to about the film coming out?

1183
00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:08.903
Um....

1184
00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:11.720
The premiere. The glamorous part.

1185
00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:14.850
[CROWD CHATTERING]

1186
00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:18.250
WATSON:
The first premiere was pretty crazy.

1187
00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:22.002
It was the first time I ever had to
really dress up or be kind of glamorous...

1188
00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:25.371
...so I wore this kind of really crazy...

1189
00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:29.811
...feather boa.
It was really strange but I loved it.

1190
00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:34.024
It was fun and it was the beginning
of everything.

1191
00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:41.199
GRINT:
The premiere was just incredible.

1192
00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:43.722
It was just this really exciting,
exciting time.

1193
00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:50.261
MAN: Can you sign an autograph for me?
Just in the front there.

1194
00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:53.640
COLUMBUS: The premiere was
a huge, huge moment for them.

1195
00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:59.105
I remember sitting in the balcony and
the place just erupted into applause--

1196
00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:03.390
A standing ovation which was fantas--
I can't lie, it's fantastic.

1197
00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:06.247
So it was just a very emotional moment.

1198
00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:09.246
And we released Potter that Friday...

1199
00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:11.569
...and Monday
we were shooting Chamber of Secrets.

1200
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:15.686
So there was really no time
for celebration or even enjoyment.

1201
00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:18.249
We saw that the film
was gonna be a big hit.

1202
00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:20.887
And on Monday we went back to work
on the second.

1203
00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:23.522
RADCLIFFE: I don't think we really
did have time to take it in.

1204
00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.697
We knew it had been successful because
often somebody would come in and say:

1205
00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:29.550
"This is a record we've broken."
But we were kids...

1206
00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:32.139
...so we just go, "Oh, cool,
brilliant, that's really cool."

1207
00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:34.523
You know, great,
we didn't know really what it meant.

1208
00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:37.349
WOMAN: Of course.
-Yeah, it's bizarre, but, yes.

1209
00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:40.468
But looking back, it's seriously cool.

1210
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:45.176
As it's been in my career,
I had critics who loved the film...

1211
00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:48.059
...critics who were mediocre
about the film...

1212
00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:52.764
...and it's an interesting element
because it goes hand in hand with me...

1213
00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:55.124
...and I now accept it for what it is.

1214
00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:59.559
But I saw this incredible four-star review
from Roger Ebert...

1215
01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:03.682
...and it just changed my life
because he's always been reluctant...

1216
01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:07.335
...to really go there with some of my
films. And he absolutely loved this film.

1217
01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:11.630
And I felt, "Well, that's good."
That really made me feel good.

1218
01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:14.444
LEWIS:
I knew it was gonna be a good film...

1219
01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:19.050
...but on the scale it's been, the
success, I just never anticipated that.

1220
01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:22.676
HEYMAN: It's easier to write history
looking backwards, isn't it?

1221
01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:25.686
I mean, I could sit here now and say,
"Yeah, I knew."

1222
01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:27.736
I didn't have a clue. I loved it.

1223
01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:33.510
Ultimately, that's all you can really do
is pursue those things that you love.

1224
01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:38.354
Nobody else, I maintain,
could've started this series off...

1225
01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:40.798
...in the way that Chris did.

1226
01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:43.009
Because, you know...

1227
01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:46.848
...before you let people like Alfonso
come in and shake things up...

1228
01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:49.539
...you have to have somebody
who gives you a solid basis...

1229
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.573
...in the foundations of these characters
and the locations and the sets.

1230
01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:56.760
And that's what Chris did brilliantly.

1231
01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.252
COLUMBUS:
I feel like a proud father...

1232
01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:01.557
...when I see how wonderful
these kids are...

1233
01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.879
...in terms of being people
and how great they are as actors.

1234
01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:07.729
There are times when I wish I was there.

1235
01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:11.380
It would just be wonderful to be able
to have another Potter moment.

1236
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.641
Because that was an intensely
magical experience.

1237
01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:20.043
On every film, there's always
gonna be aspects where I go, "Il wish."

1238
01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:22.637
That being said,
there are an awful lot of things...

1239
01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:25.560
...in that first film where I go, "Wow."

1240
01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:28.966
Chris and Stuart
created this whole world...

1241
01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:32.142
...and Chris cast these kids
and these adults...

1242
01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:34.569
...and he helped set us off on our way.

1243
01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.833
And we wouldn't be sitting here,
I don't think, if it wasn't for Chris.
