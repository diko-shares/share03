2
00:01:18.493 --> 00:01:23.315
I should've known that you would
be here, Professor McGonagall.

3
00:01:34.108 --> 00:01:37.141
Good evening, Professor Dumbledore.

4
00:01:39.515 --> 00:01:42.417
Are the rumors true, Albus?

5
00:01:42.618 --> 00:01:47.669
I'm afraid so, professor.
The good and the bad.

6
00:01:47.866 --> 00:01:50.964
- And the boy?
- Hagrid is bringing him.

7
00:01:51.162 --> 00:01:54.936
Is it wise to trust Hagrid
with something so important?

8
00:01:55.418 --> 00:02:00.152
Professor, I would trust Hagrid
with my life.

9
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.160
Professor Dumbledore, sir.
Professor McGonagall.

10
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.101
- No problems, I trust, Hagrid?
- No, sir.

11
00:02:26.295 --> 00:02:30.550
Little tyke fell asleep
as we were flying over Bristol.

12
00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:33.740
Try not to wake him.

13
00:02:34.454 --> 00:02:36.428
There you go.

14
00:02:41.654 --> 00:02:46.061
Do you really think it's safe,
leaving him with these people?

15
00:02:46.261 --> 00:02:51.279
I've watched them all day.
They're the worst sort of Muggles.

16
00:02:51.476 --> 00:02:55.338
- They really are--
- The only family he has.

17
00:02:55.541 --> 00:03:00.297
He'll be famous. Every child
in our world will know his name.

18
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.158
Exactly.

19
00:03:02.356 --> 00:03:06.447
He's far better off growing up
away from all of that.

20
00:03:08.851 --> 00:03:11.436
Until he's ready.

21
00:03:23.026 --> 00:03:28.263
There, there, Hagrid.
It's not really goodbye, after all.

22
00:03:39.537 --> 00:03:41.097
Good luck...

23
00:03:41.712 --> 00:03:44.134
...Harry Potter.

24
00:04:00.975 --> 00:04:03.822
Up. Get up!

25
00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:07.811
Now!

26
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.169
Wake up, cousin!
We're going to the zoo!

27
00:04:34.891 --> 00:04:39.942
- Here he comes, the birthday boy.
- Happy birthday, son.

28
00:04:41.739 --> 00:04:44.739
Cook breakfast.
And try not to burn anything.

29
00:04:44.938 --> 00:04:49.695
- Yes, Aunt Petunia.
- I want everything to be perfect...

30
00:04:49.898 --> 00:04:52.745
...for my Dudley's special day!

31
00:04:52.938 --> 00:04:57.694
- Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy.
- Yes, Uncle Vernon.

32
00:04:58.826 --> 00:05:01.859
Aren't they wonderful, darling?

33
00:05:03.913 --> 00:05:07.296
- How many are there?
- 36. Counted them myself.

34
00:05:07.497 --> 00:05:10.563
36?! But last year I had 37!

35
00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.502
- But some are bigger than last year's.
- I don't care!

36
00:05:14.696 --> 00:05:17.117
This is what we're going to do.

37
00:05:17.321 --> 00:05:21.477
We're going to buy you two
new presents. How's that, pumpkin?

38
00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:28.734
It should be a lovely day at the zoo.
I'm really looking forward to it.

39
00:05:31.943 --> 00:05:33.731
I'm warning you now, boy.

40
00:05:34.054 --> 00:05:37.437
Any funny business, any at all...

41
00:05:37.638 --> 00:05:40.605
...and you won't have
any meals for a week.

42
00:05:41.158 --> 00:05:42.784
Get in.

43
00:05:49.702 --> 00:05:52.003
Make it move.

44
00:05:54.597 --> 00:05:56.223
Move!

45
00:05:56.421 --> 00:05:58.810
- Move!
- He's asleep!

46
00:05:59.012 --> 00:06:01.434
He's boring.

47
00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.187
Sorry about him.

48
00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.958
He doesn't understand
what it's like, lying there...

49
00:06:09.475 --> 00:06:13.152
...watching people press
their ugly faces in on you.

50
00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:18.364
Can you hear me?

51
00:06:20.707 --> 00:06:24.601
It's just, I've never talked
to a snake before.

52
00:06:25.058 --> 00:06:26.433
Do you...?

53
00:06:26.626 --> 00:06:30.554
Do you talk to people often?

54
00:06:31.618 --> 00:06:34.814
You're from Burma, aren't you?
Was it nice there?

55
00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.246
Do you miss your family?

56
00:06:39.937 --> 00:06:44.508
I see. That's me as well.
I never knew my parents either.

57
00:06:44.705 --> 00:06:49.461
Mummy, Dad, you won't believe
what this snake is doing!

58
00:07:11.614 --> 00:07:13.556
Thanks.

59
00:07:13.758 --> 00:07:15.165
Anytime.

60
00:07:18.333 --> 00:07:20.188
Snake!

61
00:07:35.004 --> 00:07:38.233
Mum! Mummy! Help me!

62
00:07:38.428 --> 00:07:41.428
My darling boy!
How did you get in there?

63
00:07:41.948 --> 00:07:46.835
Who did this? How did you get
in there? Is there a snake?

64
00:07:51.451 --> 00:07:56.535
It's all right, sweetheart.
We'll get you out of these cold clothes.

65
00:07:58.266 --> 00:08:01.081
- What happened?
- I swear, I don't know!

66
00:08:01.274 --> 00:08:04.983
The glass was there
and then it was gone, like magic.

67
00:08:09.209 --> 00:08:11.991
There's no such thing as magic.

68
00:08:47.189 --> 00:08:49.710
Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk.

69
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:53.041
- Dad, look! Harry's got a letter!
- It's mine!

70
00:08:53.238 --> 00:08:55.856
Yours? Who'd be writing to you?

71
00:09:25.875 --> 00:09:30.217
No more mail through this letterbox.

72
00:09:41.905 --> 00:09:44.555
Have a lovely day at the office, dear.

73
00:09:47.376 --> 00:09:49.929
Shoo! Go on.

74
00:10:13.775 --> 00:10:16.491
Fine day, Sunday.

75
00:10:17.134 --> 00:10:21.606
In my opinion, best day of the week.
Why is that, Dudley?

76
00:10:21.806 --> 00:10:26.061
- Because there's no post on Sundays?
- Right you are, Harry!

77
00:10:26.254 --> 00:10:28.872
No post on Sunday.

78
00:10:30.253 --> 00:10:33.995
No blasted letters today! No, sir.

79
00:10:34.541 --> 00:10:39.330
Not one single bloody letter. Not one!

80
00:10:47.339 --> 00:10:51.114
No, sir, not one blasted, miserable--

81
00:11:02.154 --> 00:11:04.293
Make it stop, please!

82
00:11:05.994 --> 00:11:07.848
Stop it!

83
00:11:11.753 --> 00:11:14.622
Mummy, what's happening?

84
00:11:17.929 --> 00:11:22.085
Give me that! Give me that letter!

85
00:11:24.552 --> 00:11:26.276
Get off!

86
00:11:29.864 --> 00:11:33.890
They're my letters! Let go of me!

87
00:11:34.664 --> 00:11:37.533
That's it! We're going away!

88
00:11:38.215 --> 00:11:41.727
Far away, where they can't find us!

89
00:11:41.927 --> 00:11:45.058
Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?

90
00:12:18.468 --> 00:12:20.704
Make a wish, Harry.

91
00:12:36.162 --> 00:12:38.104
Who's there?

92
00:12:49.761 --> 00:12:52.127
Sorry about that.

93
00:12:58.688 --> 00:13:03.128
I demand that you leave at once.
You are breaking and entering.

94
00:13:05.823 --> 00:13:08.605
Dry up, Dursley, you great prune.

95
00:13:13.598 --> 00:13:16.947
I haven't seen you
since you was a baby, Harry.

96
00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:21.493
You're a bit more along than I expected.
Particularly in the middle.

97
00:13:21.694 --> 00:13:24.411
I'm not Harry.

98
00:13:26.206 --> 00:13:29.751
- I am.
- Well, of course you are.

99
00:13:30.462 --> 00:13:32.055
Got something for you.

100
00:13:32.253 --> 00:13:37.555
Afraid I sat on it, but I imagine
it'll taste fine just the same.

101
00:13:39.997 --> 00:13:43.258
Baked it myself, words and all.

102
00:13:48.572 --> 00:13:49.554
Thank you.

103
00:13:49.852 --> 00:13:53.746
It's not every day your young man
turns 11, is it?

104
00:14:08.346 --> 00:14:12.307
Excuse me, but who are you?

105
00:14:12.505 --> 00:14:17.240
Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys
and Grounds at Hogwarts.

106
00:14:17.433 --> 00:14:21.011
- Of course, you know about Hogwarts.
- Sorry, no.

107
00:14:21.593 --> 00:14:26.328
Didn't you ever wonder where
your mum and dad learned it all?

108
00:14:26.521 --> 00:14:27.862
Learned what?

109
00:14:28.057 --> 00:14:30.446
You're a wizard, Harry.

110
00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:33.647
- I'm a what?
- A wizard.

111
00:14:33.848 --> 00:14:36.750
A good one, I'd wager,
once you're trained up.

112
00:14:36.952 --> 00:14:39.799
No, you've made a mistake.
I mean...

113
00:14:39.928 --> 00:14:42.775
...I can't be a wizard.

114
00:14:43.383 --> 00:14:47.987
I mean, I'm just Harry. Just Harry.

115
00:14:49.015 --> 00:14:52.877
Well, Just Harry, did you ever
make anything happen?

116
00:14:53.078 --> 00:14:57.485
Anything you couldn't explain,
when you were angry or scared?

117
00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:16.268
"Dear Mr. Potter,
We are pleased to accept you...

118
00:15:16.468 --> 00:15:19.566
...at Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry."

119
00:15:19.764 --> 00:15:24.520
He will not be going! We swore
we'd put a stop to all this rubbish.

120
00:15:24.724 --> 00:15:28.782
You knew? You knew all along
and you never told me?

121
00:15:28.979 --> 00:15:31.946
Of course we knew.
How could you not be?

122
00:15:32.147 --> 00:15:35.725
My perfect sister being who she was.

123
00:15:35.922 --> 00:15:41.617
My mother and father were so proud
the day she got her letter.

124
00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:45.803
"We have a witch in the family.
Isn't it wonderful?"

125
00:15:46.002 --> 00:15:49.514
I was the only one to see her
for what she was.

126
00:15:49.713 --> 00:15:51.371
A freak!

127
00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:55.050
Then she met that Potter,
and then she had you...

128
00:15:55.249 --> 00:16:00.137
...and I knew you would be the same.
Just as strange, just as abnormal.

129
00:16:00.336 --> 00:16:05.158
And then she got herself blown up,
and we got landed with you.

130
00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:09.189
Blown up? You told me
my parents died in a car crash.

131
00:16:09.392 --> 00:16:13.548
A car crash? A car crash killed
Lily and James Potter?

132
00:16:13.744 --> 00:16:17.453
- We had to say something.
- It's an outrage! A scandal!

133
00:16:17.646 --> 00:16:20.068
He'll not be going.

134
00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:23.434
A great Muggle like you
is going to stop him?

135
00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:24.579
Muggle?

136
00:16:24.911 --> 00:16:28.772
Non-magic folk. This boy's had
his name down since he were born.

137
00:16:28.974 --> 00:16:32.716
He's going to the finest school
of witchcraft and wizardry.

138
00:16:32.909 --> 00:16:38.538
He'll be under the finest headmaster
Hogwarts has seen, Albus Dumbledore.

139
00:16:38.733 --> 00:16:43.370
I will not pay to have a crackpot
old fool teach him magic tricks.

140
00:16:43.564 --> 00:16:47.939
Never insult Albus Dumbledore...

141
00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:50.082
...in front of me.

142
00:17:07.243 --> 00:17:12.294
I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell
anyone at Hogwarts about that.

143
00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:16.418
- I'm not allowed to do magic.
- Okay.

144
00:17:17.706 --> 00:17:20.521
We're a bit behind schedule.
Best be off.

145
00:17:26.473 --> 00:17:29.571
Unless you'd rather stay, of course.

146
00:17:43.303 --> 00:17:46.402
"All students must be equipped with...

147
00:17:46.599 --> 00:17:49.447
...one standard size 2
pewter cauldron...

148
00:17:49.639 --> 00:17:55.203
...and may bring, if they desire,
either an owl, a cat or a toad."

149
00:17:55.399 --> 00:17:57.919
Can we find all this in London?

150
00:17:58.118 --> 00:18:00.387
If you know where to go.

151
00:18:22.244 --> 00:18:25.091
Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?

152
00:18:25.284 --> 00:18:29.026
No, thanks, Tom.
I'm on official Hogwarts business.

153
00:18:29.219 --> 00:18:32.154
Just helping Harry
buy his school supplies.

154
00:18:32.355 --> 00:18:35.803
Bless my soul.
It's Harry Potter!

155
00:18:39.874 --> 00:18:43.223
Welcome back, Mr. Potter.
Welcome back.

156
00:18:43.426 --> 00:18:47.550
Doris Crockford. I can't believe
I'm meeting you at last.

157
00:18:48.066 --> 00:18:53.084
Harry Potter. Can't tell you
how pleased I am to meet you.

158
00:18:53.282 --> 00:18:55.670
Hello, professor. I didn't see you.

159
00:18:55.874 --> 00:19:00.729
Professor Quirrell will be your
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

160
00:19:00.929 --> 00:19:03.263
Oh, nice to meet you.

161
00:19:03.456 --> 00:19:06.423
Fearfully fascinating subject.

162
00:19:06.624 --> 00:19:11.064
Not that you need it, eh, Potter?

163
00:19:11.968 --> 00:19:15.961
Yes, well, must be going now.
Lots to buy.

164
00:19:16.159 --> 00:19:17.850
Goodbye.

165
00:19:20.415 --> 00:19:23.895
- See, Harry? You're famous.
- But why am I famous?

166
00:19:24.095 --> 00:19:27.390
All those people,
how is it they know who I am?

167
00:19:27.582 --> 00:19:31.259
I'm not sure I'm the right person
to tell you that.

168
00:19:47.516 --> 00:19:51.160
Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.

169
00:20:06.811 --> 00:20:09.232
Here, you get your quills and ink.

170
00:20:09.435 --> 00:20:13.232
Over there, all your bits and bobs
for doing wizardry.

171
00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.219
It's a world-class racing broom.

172
00:20:39.416 --> 00:20:43.158
Look at it! The new Nimbus 2000!

173
00:20:43.352 --> 00:20:46.515
It's the fastest model yet.

174
00:20:50.007 --> 00:20:54.479
But how am I to pay for all this?
I haven't any money.

175
00:20:54.679 --> 00:20:57.995
There's your money.
Gringotts, the wizard bank.

176
00:20:58.167 --> 00:21:03.381
Ain't no safer place, not one.
Except perhaps Hogwarts.

177
00:21:15.573 --> 00:21:19.369
Hagrid, what exactly
are these things?

178
00:21:19.572 --> 00:21:24.657
They're goblins. Clever as they come,
but not the most friendly of beasts.

179
00:21:24.852 --> 00:21:26.675
Best stay close.

180
00:21:30.548 --> 00:21:34.093
Mr. Harry Potter wishes
to make a withdrawal.

181
00:21:38.163 --> 00:21:41.196
And does Mr. Harry Potter
have his key?

182
00:21:42.098 --> 00:21:45.197
Wait a minute.
Got it here somewhere.

183
00:21:47.922 --> 00:21:50.639
Ha! There's the little devil.

184
00:21:50.834 --> 00:21:53.551
And there's something else as well.

185
00:21:54.802 --> 00:21:57.998
Professor Dumbledore gave me this.

186
00:22:01.873 --> 00:22:06.728
It's about You-Know-What
in vault you-know-which.

187
00:22:07.984 --> 00:22:09.872
Very well.

188
00:22:14.832 --> 00:22:17.582
Vault 687.

189
00:22:19.408 --> 00:22:21.611
Lamp, please.

190
00:22:29.775 --> 00:22:31.084
Key, please.

191
00:22:53.548 --> 00:22:57.378
Did you think your parents
would leave you with nothing?

192
00:22:58.348 --> 00:23:01.959
- Vault 713.
- What's in there, Hagrid?

193
00:23:02.156 --> 00:23:06.149
Can't tell you.
Hogwarts business. Very secret.

194
00:23:06.348 --> 00:23:07.842
Stand back.

195
00:23:34.985 --> 00:23:37.668
Best not to mention this to anyone.

196
00:23:45.704 --> 00:23:49.501
I still need a wand.

197
00:23:49.704 --> 00:23:53.697
A wand? You want Ollivanders.
There ain't no place better.

198
00:23:53.863 --> 00:23:58.500
Run along there and wait. I got one more
thing to do. Won't be long.

199
00:24:15.782 --> 00:24:17.538
Hello?

200
00:24:20.389 --> 00:24:22.177
Hello?

201
00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:29.664
I wondered when
I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter.

202
00:24:37.124 --> 00:24:39.262
It seems only yesterday...

203
00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:45.089
...that your mother and father were
in here buying their first wands.

204
00:24:51.458 --> 00:24:53.662
Here we are.

205
00:25:01.921 --> 00:25:04.343
Give it a wave.

206
00:25:10.529 --> 00:25:13.016
Apparently not.

207
00:25:20.128 --> 00:25:22.266
Perhaps...

208
00:25:23.872 --> 00:25:25.944
...this.

209
00:25:32.639 --> 00:25:37.111
No, no, definitely not.
No matter.

210
00:25:44.062 --> 00:25:45.588
I wonder....

211
00:26:13.692 --> 00:26:15.895
Curious.

212
00:26:16.091 --> 00:26:18.905
Very curious.

213
00:26:19.099 --> 00:26:22.099
Sorry, but what's curious?

214
00:26:23.674 --> 00:26:26.903
I remember every wand
I've ever sold, Mr. Potter.

215
00:26:27.098 --> 00:26:29.716
It so happens that the phoenix...

216
00:26:29.914 --> 00:26:34.387
...whose tail feather resides
in your wand, gave another feather.

217
00:26:34.841 --> 00:26:37.808
Just one other.

218
00:26:38.009 --> 00:26:42.165
It is curious that you should
be destined for this wand...

219
00:26:42.361 --> 00:26:47.859
...when its brother
gave you that scar.

220
00:26:49.592 --> 00:26:52.658
And who owned that wand?

221
00:26:53.496 --> 00:26:55.765
We do not speak his name.

222
00:26:56.247 --> 00:26:59.596
The wand chooses
the wizard, Mr. Potter.

223
00:26:59.799 --> 00:27:02.646
It's not always clear why.

224
00:27:03.031 --> 00:27:06.347
But I think it is clear...

225
00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:10.325
...that we can expect
great things from you.

226
00:27:10.518 --> 00:27:14.642
After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named...

227
00:27:14.838 --> 00:27:17.358
...did great things.

228
00:27:17.558 --> 00:27:19.467
Terrible...

229
00:27:19.957 --> 00:27:23.088
...yes, but great.

230
00:27:28.437 --> 00:27:30.378
Harry! Harry!

231
00:27:30.804 --> 00:27:33.073
Happy birthday.

232
00:27:39.924 --> 00:27:43.273
You all right, Harry?
You seem very quiet.

233
00:27:43.603 --> 00:27:49.004
He killed my parents, didn't he?
The one who gave me this.

234
00:27:49.203 --> 00:27:52.618
You know, Hagrid. I know you do.

235
00:27:56.370 --> 00:28:00.777
First, and understand this
because it's very important:

236
00:28:00.978 --> 00:28:03.367
Not all wizards are good.

237
00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:05.991
Some of them go bad.
A few years ago...

238
00:28:06.194 --> 00:28:10.983
...there was a wizard who went as bad
as you can go. His name was V--

239
00:28:11.185 --> 00:28:14.698
- His name was V--
- Maybe if you wrote it down?

240
00:28:14.897 --> 00:28:16.686
No, I can't spell it.

241
00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:20.939
- All right, Voldemort.
- Voldemort?

242
00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:26.923
It was dark times, Harry.

243
00:28:29.136 --> 00:28:32.103
Voldemort started
to gather some followers.

244
00:28:32.303 --> 00:28:35.532
Brought them over to the Dark Side.

245
00:28:36.879 --> 00:28:39.879
Anyone that stood up to him
ended up dead.

246
00:28:40.942 --> 00:28:43.877
Your parents fought against him.

247
00:28:44.078 --> 00:28:47.656
But nobody lived once
he decided to kill them.

248
00:28:51.918 --> 00:28:54.339
Nobody, not one.

249
00:28:54.541 --> 00:28:56.843
Except you.

250
00:28:58.797 --> 00:29:02.758
Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?

251
00:29:03.181 --> 00:29:07.206
Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut
on your forehead, Harry.

252
00:29:07.437 --> 00:29:13.000
A mark like that only comes from being
touched by a curse, an evil curse.

253
00:29:13.196 --> 00:29:16.611
What happened to V--?
To You-Know-Who?

254
00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:21.001
Well, some say he died.

255
00:29:21.195 --> 00:29:23.464
Codswallop, in my opinion.

256
00:29:23.659 --> 00:29:26.823
Nope, I reckon he's out there still...

257
00:29:27.018 --> 00:29:29.866
...too tired to carry on.

258
00:29:30.058 --> 00:29:35.273
But one thing's certain. Something
about you stumped him that night.

259
00:29:35.466 --> 00:29:39.557
That's why you're famous.
That's why everybody knows your name.

260
00:29:40.041 --> 00:29:43.521
You're the boy who lived.

261
00:29:52.457 --> 00:29:55.107
What are you looking at?

262
00:29:56.808 --> 00:29:58.662
Blimey, is that the time?

263
00:29:58.856 --> 00:30:02.750
I'm gonna have to leave you.
Dumbledore will be wanting his--

264
00:30:02.952 --> 00:30:07.588
Well, he'll be wanting to see me.
Your train leaves in 10 minutes.

265
00:30:07.783 --> 00:30:12.932
Here's your ticket. Stick to your ticket,
that's very important.

266
00:30:15.718 --> 00:30:17.889
"Platform 9 3/4"?

267
00:30:18.086 --> 00:30:22.690
But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake.
This says platform 9 3/4.

268
00:30:22.885 --> 00:30:26.082
There's no such thing, is there?

269
00:30:43.812 --> 00:30:45.306
Sorry.

270
00:30:46.756 --> 00:30:49.406
Excuse me. Excuse me.

271
00:30:49.603 --> 00:30:51.097
On your left.

272
00:30:51.299 --> 00:30:54.976
Can you tell me where
I might find platform 9 3/4?

273
00:30:55.171 --> 00:30:57.626
Think you're being funny, do you?

274
00:30:57.827 --> 00:31:01.023
It's the same every year,
packed with Muggles.

275
00:31:01.411 --> 00:31:04.672
- Muggles?
- Platform 9 3/4, this way.

276
00:31:10.146 --> 00:31:13.179
All right, Percy, you first.

277
00:31:22.721 --> 00:31:23.931
Fred, you next.

278
00:31:24.097 --> 00:31:27.609
- He's not Fred, I am.
- You call yourself our mother?

279
00:31:27.808 --> 00:31:29.695
I'm sorry, George.

280
00:31:33.696 --> 00:31:36.030
I'm only joking. I am Fred.

281
00:31:41.567 --> 00:31:44.054
Excuse me.

282
00:31:45.086 --> 00:31:47.803
Could you tell me how to...?

283
00:31:47.999 --> 00:31:51.381
How to get onto the platform?
Not to worry, dear.

284
00:31:51.582 --> 00:31:53.949
It's Ron's first time
to Hogwarts as well.

285
00:31:54.142 --> 00:31:59.804
All you do is walk straight at the wall
between platforms 9 and 10.

286
00:31:59.966 --> 00:32:03.282
- Best to run if you're nervous.
- Good luck.

287
00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:02.677
Excuse me. Do you mind?
Everywhere else is full.

288
00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:04.978
Not at all.

289
00:33:07.928 --> 00:33:10.262
I'm Ron, by the way.
Ron Weasley.

290
00:33:10.456 --> 00:33:13.008
I'm Harry. Harry Potter.

291
00:33:14.295 --> 00:33:16.270
So it's true!

292
00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:19.153
I mean, do you really have the...?

293
00:33:19.702 --> 00:33:22.484
- The what?
- The scar?

294
00:33:25.494 --> 00:33:27.633
Wicked!

295
00:33:30.006 --> 00:33:34.959
- Anything off the trolley, dears?
- No, thanks. I'm all set.

296
00:33:38.837 --> 00:33:41.041
We'll take the lot.

297
00:33:51.283 --> 00:33:55.920
- Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans?
- They mean every flavor.

298
00:33:56.276 --> 00:33:59.571
There's chocolate
and peppermint and also...

299
00:33:59.763 --> 00:34:03.473
...spinach, liver and tripe.

300
00:34:03.666 --> 00:34:07.594
George sweared he got
a booger-flavored one once.

301
00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:17.229
- Are they real frogs?
- It's a spell. You want the cards.

302
00:34:17.425 --> 00:34:22.662
Each pack's got a famous witch
or wizard. I've got about 500 meself.

303
00:34:24.145 --> 00:34:26.283
Watch it!

304
00:34:28.241 --> 00:34:31.885
That's rotten luck. They've only
got one good jump in them.

305
00:34:34.608 --> 00:34:38.350
- I've got Dumbledore!
- I got about six of him.

306
00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:41.541
Hey, he's gone!

307
00:34:41.744 --> 00:34:45.060
You can't expect him to
hang around all day, can you?

308
00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:48.679
This is Scabbers.
Pathetic, isn't he?

309
00:34:48.847 --> 00:34:49.992
A little.

310
00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:53.419
Fred gave me a spell
to turn him yellow. Want to see?

311
00:34:53.615 --> 00:34:55.524
Yeah.

312
00:35:02.029 --> 00:35:03.590
Has anyone seen a toad?

313
00:35:03.981 --> 00:35:06.468
- A boy named Neville's lost one.
- No.

314
00:35:07.085 --> 00:35:11.241
Oh, are you doing magic?
Let's see, then.

315
00:35:12.237 --> 00:35:16.393
Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow

316
00:35:16.653 --> 00:35:19.587
Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow

317
00:35:22.252 --> 00:35:27.587
Are you sure that's a real spell?
Well, it's not very good, is it?

318
00:35:27.787 --> 00:35:30.951
I've only tried
a few simple ones myself...

319
00:35:31.147 --> 00:35:33.667
...but they've all worked for me.

320
00:35:37.163 --> 00:35:39.105
For example:

321
00:35:39.498 --> 00:35:42.148
Oculus Reparo.

322
00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:46.657
That's better, isn't it?

323
00:35:47.818 --> 00:35:51.560
Holy cricket, you're Harry Potter!

324
00:35:51.753 --> 00:35:55.201
I'm Hermione Granger.
And you are...?

325
00:35:55.881 --> 00:35:58.946
- I'm Ron Weasley.
- Pleasure.

326
00:35:59.145 --> 00:36:04.033
You two better change into robes.
I expect we'll be arriving soon.

327
00:36:08.008 --> 00:36:11.303
You've got dirt on your nose.
Did you know?

328
00:36:11.495 --> 00:36:13.405
Just there.

329
00:36:25.222 --> 00:36:28.866
Right, then.
First years, this way, please!

330
00:36:29.062 --> 00:36:34.080
Come on, first years, don't be shy.
Come on now, hurry up.

331
00:36:40.741 --> 00:36:43.643
- Hello, Harry.
- Hi, Hagrid.

332
00:36:44.676 --> 00:36:48.832
Right, then. This way to the boats.
Come on now, follow me.

333
00:37:32.641 --> 00:37:34.364
Wicked.

334
00:38:01.342 --> 00:38:03.546
Welcome to Hogwarts.

335
00:38:03.741 --> 00:38:07.538
Shortly, you'll pass through
these doors and join your classmates.

336
00:38:07.741 --> 00:38:12.629
But before you take your seats,
you must be sorted into your houses.

337
00:38:12.829 --> 00:38:15.829
They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff...

338
00:38:16.029 --> 00:38:20.283
...Ravenclaw and Slytherin.

339
00:38:20.701 --> 00:38:25.490
While you're here, your house
will be like your family.

340
00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:29.488
Your triumphs will earn you points.

341
00:38:29.692 --> 00:38:33.652
Any rule-breaking
and you will lose points.

342
00:38:33.851 --> 00:38:38.935
At the end of the year, the house
with the most points wins the house cup.

343
00:38:39.195 --> 00:38:40.405
Trevor!

344
00:38:48.986 --> 00:38:50.513
Sorry.

345
00:38:50.714 --> 00:38:54.489
The Sorting Ceremony
will begin momentarily.

346
00:38:55.770 --> 00:38:59.031
It's true then,
what they're saying on the train.

347
00:38:59.385 --> 00:39:01.938
Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.

348
00:39:02.137 --> 00:39:03.446
Harry Potter?

349
00:39:04.089 --> 00:39:06.674
This is Crabbe and Goyle.

350
00:39:06.873 --> 00:39:09.076
And I'm Malfoy.

351
00:39:09.368 --> 00:39:11.571
Draco Malfoy.

352
00:39:13.463 --> 00:39:16.976
Think my name's funny, do you?
I've no need to ask yours.

353
00:39:17.144 --> 00:39:22.643
Red hair and a hand-me-down robe?
You must be a Weasley.

354
00:39:23.575 --> 00:39:27.436
You'll find out some wizarding families
are better than others.

355
00:39:27.639 --> 00:39:31.250
You don't want to go making friends
with the wrong sort.

356
00:39:31.446 --> 00:39:33.551
I can help you there.

357
00:39:35.702 --> 00:39:39.346
I think I can tell the wrong sort
for myself, thanks.

358
00:39:44.789 --> 00:39:46.894
We're ready for you now.
Follow me.

359
00:40:04.724 --> 00:40:09.033
The ceiling isn't real. It's bewitched
to look like the night sky.

360
00:40:09.331 --> 00:40:12.146
I read about it
in Hogwarts, A History.

361
00:40:24.849 --> 00:40:27.566
Will you wait along here, please?

362
00:40:28.945 --> 00:40:31.595
Now, before we begin...

363
00:40:31.761 --> 00:40:34.925
...Professor Dumbledore would like
to say a few words.

364
00:40:35.152 --> 00:40:39.724
I have a few start-of-term notices
I wish to announce.

365
00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:42.120
The first years, please note...

366
00:40:42.384 --> 00:40:48.166
...that the Dark Forest is
strictly forbidden to all students.

367
00:40:48.368 --> 00:40:53.702
Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch,
has asked me to remind you...

368
00:40:53.903 --> 00:40:58.278
...that the third-floor corridor
is out of bounds...

369
00:40:58.575 --> 00:41:02.666
...to everyone who does not wish
to die a most painful death.

370
00:41:03.982 --> 00:41:05.837
Thank you.

371
00:41:07.502 --> 00:41:11.462
When I call your name,
you will come forth.

372
00:41:11.662 --> 00:41:15.109
I shall place the Sorting Hat
on your head...

373
00:41:15.310 --> 00:41:18.408
...and you will be sorted
into your houses.

374
00:41:18.605 --> 00:41:21.125
Hermione Granger.

375
00:41:23.245 --> 00:41:25.798
Oh, no. Okay, relax.

376
00:41:26.156 --> 00:41:29.385
Mental, that one, I'm telling you.

377
00:41:34.667 --> 00:41:38.311
Right, then. Right.

378
00:41:38.571 --> 00:41:42.018
Okay. Gryffindor!

379
00:41:50.410 --> 00:41:53.127
Draco Malfoy.

380
00:41:57.450 --> 00:41:59.621
Slytherin!

381
00:42:00.489 --> 00:42:03.336
Every wizard who went bad
was in Slytherin.

382
00:42:03.529 --> 00:42:05.950
Susan Bones.

383
00:42:14.184 --> 00:42:16.191
Harry, what is it?

384
00:42:16.392 --> 00:42:19.043
Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine.

385
00:42:19.239 --> 00:42:20.646
Let's see....

386
00:42:20.872 --> 00:42:25.028
I know! Hufflepuff!

387
00:42:26.727 --> 00:42:29.061
Ronald Weasley.

388
00:42:42.277 --> 00:42:47.133
Another Weasley!
I know just what to do with you.

389
00:42:47.814 --> 00:42:50.017
Gryffindor!

390
00:42:55.972 --> 00:42:58.339
Harry Potter.

391
00:43:15.651 --> 00:43:18.553
Difficult, very difficult.

392
00:43:18.723 --> 00:43:22.552
Plenty of courage, I see.
Not a bad mind, either.

393
00:43:22.754 --> 00:43:24.958
There's talent, oh, yes.

394
00:43:25.154 --> 00:43:28.831
And a thirst to prove yourself.

395
00:43:29.026 --> 00:43:31.098
But where to put you?

396
00:43:31.681 --> 00:43:34.070
Not Slytherin, not Slytherin!

397
00:43:34.273 --> 00:43:37.786
Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure?

398
00:43:37.985 --> 00:43:42.687
You could be great, you know.
It's all here, in your head.

399
00:43:42.881 --> 00:43:47.998
And Slytherin will help you on the way
to greatness, no doubt about that.

400
00:43:48.288 --> 00:43:52.761
No? Well, if you're sure.

401
00:43:52.959 --> 00:43:54.650
Better be...

402
00:43:54.848 --> 00:43:56.735
...Gryffindor!

403
00:44:21.213 --> 00:44:23.864
Your attention, please.

404
00:44:25.821 --> 00:44:28.406
Let the feast begin.

405
00:44:44.667 --> 00:44:46.161
I'm half and half.

406
00:44:46.331 --> 00:44:49.430
Me dad's a Muggle. Mum's a witch.

407
00:44:49.627 --> 00:44:53.009
Bit of a nasty shock for him
when he found out.

408
00:44:54.010 --> 00:44:57.622
Percy, who's that teacher
talking to Professor Quirrell?

409
00:44:57.946 --> 00:45:00.946
Professor Snape,
head of Slytherin house.

410
00:45:01.146 --> 00:45:03.001
- What's he teach?
- Potions.

411
00:45:03.193 --> 00:45:08.561
But he fancies the Dark Arts.
He's been after Quirrell's job for years.

412
00:45:12.889 --> 00:45:15.125
Hello! How are you?

413
00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:18.582
Welcome to Gryffindor.

414
00:45:28.216 --> 00:45:30.604
It's the Bloody Baron!

415
00:45:35.127 --> 00:45:37.777
Hello, Sir Nicholas.
Have a nice summer?

416
00:45:37.975 --> 00:45:43.190
Dismal. Once again, my request to join
the Headless Hunt has been denied.

417
00:45:46.102 --> 00:45:48.949
I know you.
You're Nearly Headless Nick.

418
00:45:49.109 --> 00:45:51.727
I prefer Sir Nicholas,
if you don't mind.

419
00:45:51.925 --> 00:45:55.274
"Nearly" headless?
How can you be nearly headless?

420
00:45:55.573 --> 00:45:57.460
Like this.

421
00:46:07.092 --> 00:46:10.801
Gryffindors, follow me, please.
Keep up. Thank you.

422
00:46:10.996 --> 00:46:15.152
Ravenclaw, follow me. This way.

423
00:46:15.347 --> 00:46:18.576
This is the most direct path
to the dormitories.

424
00:46:18.739 --> 00:46:22.798
Keep an eye on the staircases.
They like to change.

425
00:46:31.537 --> 00:46:37.101
Keep up, please, and follow me.
Quickly now, come on. Come on.

426
00:46:37.297 --> 00:46:39.850
That picture's moving.

427
00:46:40.049 --> 00:46:43.365
- Look at that one.
- I think she fancies you.

428
00:46:45.105 --> 00:46:47.341
- Look!
- Who's that girl?

429
00:46:47.537 --> 00:46:49.925
Welcome to Hogwarts.

430
00:47:05.295 --> 00:47:06.855
Password?

431
00:47:07.247 --> 00:47:09.996
Caput Draconis.

432
00:47:16.462 --> 00:47:21.131
Follow me, everyone. Keep up.
Quickly, come on.

433
00:47:23.725 --> 00:47:26.059
Gather around here.

434
00:47:27.661 --> 00:47:30.858
Welcome to the Gryffindor common room.

435
00:47:31.052 --> 00:47:35.275
Boys' dormitory is upstairs to the left.
Girls, the same on your right.

436
00:47:35.468 --> 00:47:38.435
Your belongings have
already been brought up.

437
00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:45.437
Made it!

438
00:48:45.638 --> 00:48:50.078
Can you imagine the look on old
McGonagall's face if we were late?

439
00:48:52.997 --> 00:48:57.754
- That was bloody brilliant!
- Thank you for that assessment.

440
00:48:57.957 --> 00:49:02.080
It'd be better if I transfigured
Mr. Potter and you into a watch.

441
00:49:02.244 --> 00:49:05.343
- Then one of you might be on time.
- We got lost.

442
00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:11.104
Then perhaps a map? I trust you
don't need one to find your seats.

443
00:49:18.915 --> 00:49:24.381
There will be no foolish wand-waving
or silly incantations in this class.

444
00:49:24.579 --> 00:49:28.059
As such, I don't expect
many of you to appreciate...

445
00:49:28.258 --> 00:49:31.869
...the subtle science and exact art
that is potion-making.

446
00:49:32.034 --> 00:49:35.001
However, for those select few...

447
00:49:35.874 --> 00:49:39.103
...who possess the predisposition...

448
00:49:42.561 --> 00:49:45.790
...I can teach you
how to bewitch the mind...

449
00:49:45.985 --> 00:49:48.800
...and ensnare the senses.

450
00:49:48.961 --> 00:49:51.416
I can tell you how to bottle fame...

451
00:49:51.585 --> 00:49:57.247
...brew glory and even
put a stopper in death.

452
00:50:01.407 --> 00:50:07.222
Then again, maybe some of you have come
to Hogwarts in possession of abilities...

453
00:50:07.391 --> 00:50:10.773
...so formidable that
you feel confident enough...

454
00:50:10.943 --> 00:50:14.238
...to not pay attention.

455
00:50:20.478 --> 00:50:22.998
Mr. Potter.

456
00:50:24.158 --> 00:50:27.834
Our new celebrity.

457
00:50:29.917 --> 00:50:35.481
What would I get if I added root
of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?

458
00:50:38.588 --> 00:50:40.922
You don't know? Let's try again.

459
00:50:41.116 --> 00:50:45.523
Where would you look
if I asked you to find a bezoar?

460
00:50:46.748 --> 00:50:48.122
I don't know, sir.

461
00:50:48.347 --> 00:50:52.089
What is the difference
between monkshood and wolfsbane?

462
00:50:54.491 --> 00:50:56.662
I don't know, sir.

463
00:50:57.690 --> 00:50:59.283
Pity.

464
00:51:00.603 --> 00:51:04.596
Clearly, fame isn't everything...

465
00:51:05.338 --> 00:51:08.021
...is it, Mr. Potter?

466
00:51:10.138 --> 00:51:15.472
Eye of rabbit, harp string hum
Turn this water into rum

467
00:51:16.665 --> 00:51:18.159
Eye of rabbit....

468
00:51:18.457 --> 00:51:21.042
What's Seamus trying to do
to the water?

469
00:51:21.241 --> 00:51:25.812
Turn it to rum. Actually managed
a weak tea yesterday, before--

470
00:51:32.216 --> 00:51:34.070
Mail's here.

471
00:52:05.045 --> 00:52:07.859
Can I borrow this? Thanks.

472
00:52:11.637 --> 00:52:13.775
Look, Neville's got a Remembrall.

473
00:52:13.972 --> 00:52:19.187
I've read about those. The smoke turns
red when you've forgotten something.

474
00:52:19.539 --> 00:52:22.768
The problem is, I can't remember
what I've forgotten.

475
00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:26.321
Somebody broke into Gringotts. Listen.

476
00:52:26.515 --> 00:52:30.060
"Believed to be the work
of Dark wizards or witches...

477
00:52:30.259 --> 00:52:35.790
...Gringotts goblins acknowledge
the breach but insist nothing was taken.

478
00:52:35.987 --> 00:52:41.485
The vault in question, number 713,
had been emptied earlier that same day."

479
00:52:41.682 --> 00:52:45.740
That's odd. That's the vault
Hagrid and I went to.

480
00:52:54.288 --> 00:52:57.900
- Good afternoon, class.
- Good afternoon, Madam Hooch.

481
00:52:58.096 --> 00:53:00.779
Good afternoon, Amanda.
Good afternoon.

482
00:53:02.032 --> 00:53:04.399
Welcome to your first flying lesson.

483
00:53:04.592 --> 00:53:08.367
What are you waiting for?
Step up to your broomstick.

484
00:53:08.559 --> 00:53:13.927
Come on now, hurry up. Stick your hand
over the broom and say, "Up."

485
00:53:14.127 --> 00:53:15.982
Up!

486
00:53:16.175 --> 00:53:17.123
Up.

487
00:53:18.575 --> 00:53:20.298
Up.

488
00:53:21.967 --> 00:53:23.493
Up. Up!

489
00:53:23.694 --> 00:53:25.603
With feeling.

490
00:53:33.933 --> 00:53:35.973
Shut up, Harry.

491
00:53:36.173 --> 00:53:40.679
Now, once you've got hold of
your broom, I want you to mount it.

492
00:53:40.876 --> 00:53:44.673
Grip it tight. You don't wanna be
sliding off the end.

493
00:53:45.068 --> 00:53:49.824
When I blow my whistle, I want you
to kick off from the ground, hard.

494
00:53:50.028 --> 00:53:53.704
Keep your broom steady,
hover for a moment...

495
00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:58.023
...then lean forward slightly
and touch back down.

496
00:53:58.219 --> 00:54:01.219
On my whistle. Three, two....

497
00:54:03.595 --> 00:54:04.904
Mr. Longbottom.

498
00:54:09.322 --> 00:54:12.104
- Mr. Longbottom!
- Down, down!

499
00:54:12.298 --> 00:54:13.475
Neville!

500
00:54:17.066 --> 00:54:19.618
Come back down this instant!

501
00:54:47.399 --> 00:54:49.701
Everyone out of the way!

502
00:54:55.014 --> 00:54:57.087
Is he all right?

503
00:54:57.414 --> 00:55:02.912
Oh, dear, it's a broken wrist.
Poor boy. Come on now, up you get.

504
00:55:04.133 --> 00:55:08.606
Keep your feet on the ground
while I take him to the hospital wing.

505
00:55:08.805 --> 00:55:12.318
Understand? If I see
a single broom in the air...

506
00:55:12.516 --> 00:55:17.567
...the one riding it will be expelled
before they can say Quidditch.

507
00:55:17.765 --> 00:55:19.619
Did you see his face?

508
00:55:19.812 --> 00:55:23.521
If he had squeezed this, he'd have
remembered to fall on his arse.

509
00:55:23.716 --> 00:55:26.105
Give it here, Malfoy.

510
00:55:26.915 --> 00:55:30.460
No. I'll leave it somewhere
for Longbottom to find.

511
00:55:34.435 --> 00:55:36.802
How about on the roof?

512
00:55:37.955 --> 00:55:41.631
What's the matter, Potter?
Bit beyond your reach?

513
00:55:44.034 --> 00:55:47.711
Harry, no way!
You heard what Madam Hooch said.

514
00:55:47.906 --> 00:55:50.655
Besides, you don't know how to fly.

515
00:55:50.977 --> 00:55:52.832
What an idiot.

516
00:55:56.033 --> 00:55:59.382
Give it here or I'll
knock you off your broom!

517
00:55:59.585 --> 00:56:01.592
Is that so?

518
00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:06.844
Have it your way, then.

519
00:56:38.205 --> 00:56:41.718
- Nice going, Harry.
- That was wicked, Harry!

520
00:56:41.917 --> 00:56:43.892
Harry Potter!

521
00:56:44.797 --> 00:56:46.739
Follow me.

522
00:56:57.915 --> 00:57:00.086
You wait here.

523
00:57:01.788 --> 00:57:06.872
Professor Quirrell, excuse me.
Could I borrow Wood for a moment?

524
00:57:07.067 --> 00:57:08.823
Yes, of course.

525
00:57:14.202 --> 00:57:19.734
Potter, this is Oliver Wood.
Wood, I have found you a Seeker.

526
00:57:21.786 --> 00:57:25.134
Have you heard? Harry Potter's
the new Gryffindor Seeker.

527
00:57:25.337 --> 00:57:27.475
I always knew he'd do well.

528
00:57:27.929 --> 00:57:31.823
Seeker? But first years
never make the house teams.

529
00:57:31.993 --> 00:57:36.335
- You must be the youngest player in--
- A century, McGonagall says.

530
00:57:36.536 --> 00:57:39.024
Well done, Harry.
Wood's just told us.

531
00:57:39.224 --> 00:57:41.646
Fred and George are on the team.
Beaters.

532
00:57:41.848 --> 00:57:45.393
Our job is to make sure you
don't get bloodied up too bad.

533
00:57:45.592 --> 00:57:48.177
Can't make any promises.
Rough game, Quidditch.

534
00:57:48.343 --> 00:57:52.140
But no one's died in years.
Someone vanishes occasionally.

535
00:57:52.343 --> 00:57:54.993
But they'll turn up in a month or two.

536
00:57:55.191 --> 00:58:00.657
Go on. Quidditch is great. Best game
there is, and you'll be great too.

537
00:58:00.854 --> 00:58:03.919
I've never played.
What if I make a fool of myself?

538
00:58:04.278 --> 00:58:08.915
You won't make a fool of yourself.
It's in your blood.

539
00:58:17.141 --> 00:58:20.785
You never told me your father
was a Seeker too.

540
00:58:21.588 --> 00:58:23.661
I didn't know.

541
00:58:28.052 --> 00:58:32.394
I'm telling you, it's spooky.
She knows more about you than you do.

542
00:58:32.595 --> 00:58:34.831
Who doesn't?

543
00:58:35.731 --> 00:58:37.738
What's happening?

544
00:58:37.971 --> 00:58:41.997
The staircases change, remember?

545
00:58:47.218 --> 00:58:51.495
- Let's go this way.
- Before the staircase moves again.

546
00:58:58.833 --> 00:59:02.128
Does anybody feel like
we shouldn't be here?

547
00:59:02.321 --> 00:59:04.361
We're not supposed to be here.

548
00:59:04.561 --> 00:59:08.336
This is the third floor.
It's forbidden.

549
00:59:09.488 --> 00:59:10.982
Let's go.

550
00:59:13.103 --> 00:59:15.885
- It's Filch's cat!
- Run!

551
00:59:19.504 --> 00:59:22.799
Quick, let's hide through that door!

552
00:59:27.599 --> 00:59:29.606
- It's locked!
- We're done for!

553
00:59:29.774 --> 00:59:31.879
Move over!

554
00:59:32.782 --> 00:59:34.822
Alohomora.

555
00:59:35.694 --> 00:59:37.516
Get in.

556
00:59:38.702 --> 00:59:39.782
Alohomora?

557
00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:42.371
Standard Book of Spells,
chapter seven.

558
00:59:42.573 --> 00:59:45.835
Anyone here, my sweet?

559
00:59:51.820 --> 00:59:52.769
Come on.

560
00:59:53.644 --> 00:59:56.011
- Filch is gone.
- He thinks this door's locked.

561
00:59:56.204 --> 00:59:59.684
- It was locked.
- And for good reason.

562
01:00:24.297 --> 01:00:29.600
What are they doing, keeping a thing
like that locked up in a school?

563
01:00:29.801 --> 01:00:33.281
Didn't you see what
it was standing on?

564
01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:37.506
I wasn't looking at its feet!
I was preoccupied with its heads.

565
01:00:37.705 --> 01:00:40.454
Or maybe you didn't notice.
There were three!

566
01:00:40.649 --> 01:00:44.161
It was standing on a trap door.
It wasn't there by accident.

567
01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:47.775
- It's guarding something.
- Guarding something?

568
01:00:48.135 --> 01:00:51.812
That's right. Now, if you two don't mind,
I'm going to bed...

569
01:00:52.008 --> 01:00:55.455
...before you come up with another idea
to get us killed.

570
01:00:55.655 --> 01:00:58.655
Or worse, expelled.

571
01:01:01.798 --> 01:01:05.857
She needs to sort out her priorities.

572
01:01:10.278 --> 01:01:14.303
Quidditch is easy to understand.
Each team has seven players.

573
01:01:14.502 --> 01:01:20.033
Three Chasers, two Beaters,
one Keeper and a Seeker. That's you.

574
01:01:24.901 --> 01:01:28.861
There are three kinds of balls.
This one's called the Quaffle.

575
01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:34.776
The Chasers handle the Quaffle and try
to put it through one of those hoops.

576
01:01:34.979 --> 01:01:39.169
The Keeper, that's me,
defends the hoops. With me so far?

577
01:01:39.363 --> 01:01:43.672
I think so. What are those?

578
01:01:45.859 --> 01:01:47.931
You better take this.

579
01:01:57.570 --> 01:02:00.220
Careful now, it's coming back.

580
01:02:06.592 --> 01:02:10.040
Not bad, Potter.
You'd make a fair Beater.

581
01:02:26.015 --> 01:02:28.219
What was that?

582
01:02:28.959 --> 01:02:32.537
Bludger. Nasty little buggers.

583
01:02:32.735 --> 01:02:36.083
But you are a Seeker.

584
01:02:39.518 --> 01:02:43.926
The only thing I want you
to worry about is this.

585
01:02:44.126 --> 01:02:46.581
The Golden Snitch.

586
01:02:46.781 --> 01:02:49.651
- I like this ball.
- You like it now.

587
01:02:49.853 --> 01:02:53.715
Just wait. It's wicked fast
and damn near impossible to see.

588
01:02:53.917 --> 01:02:55.772
What do I do with it?

589
01:02:55.964 --> 01:02:59.095
You catch it.
Before the other team's Seeker.

590
01:02:59.292 --> 01:03:01.681
You catch this, the game's over.

591
01:03:01.884 --> 01:03:05.681
You catch this, Potter,
and we win.

592
01:03:14.395 --> 01:03:19.512
One of a wizard's most rudimentary
skills is levitation...

593
01:03:19.706 --> 01:03:23.503
...or the ability to make objects fly.

594
01:03:23.706 --> 01:03:26.008
Do you have your feathers? Good.

595
01:03:26.202 --> 01:03:31.123
Now, don't forget the nice wrist
movement we've been practicing.

596
01:03:31.321 --> 01:03:34.899
The swish and flick. Everyone.

597
01:03:35.098 --> 01:03:40.465
The swish and flick. Good.
Oh, and enunciate.

598
01:03:41.145 --> 01:03:45.236
Wingardium Leviosa.
Off you go, then.

599
01:03:46.296 --> 01:03:48.685
Wingardium Leviosa.

600
01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:51.124
Wingardium Leviosa.

601
01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:58.930
No, stop, stop, stop! You're going
to take someone's eye out.

602
01:03:59.127 --> 01:04:04.877
Besides, you're saying it wrong.
It's Leviosa, not Leviosar.

603
01:04:05.399 --> 01:04:09.490
You do it then, if you're so clever.
Go on, go on.

604
01:04:10.710 --> 01:04:13.645
Wingardium Leviosa.

605
01:04:20.853 --> 01:04:26.221
Well done! See here, everyone,
Miss Granger's done it!

606
01:04:26.421 --> 01:04:28.046
Splendid!

607
01:04:29.557 --> 01:04:31.629
Well done, dear.

608
01:04:35.732 --> 01:04:39.627
I think we're going to need
another feather over here.

609
01:04:45.875 --> 01:04:49.966
"It's Leviosa, not Leviosar."

610
01:04:50.163 --> 01:04:55.280
She's a nightmare, honestly!
No wonder she hasn't got any friends.

611
01:04:55.987 --> 01:04:58.353
I think she heard you.

612
01:05:25.872 --> 01:05:27.879
Where's Hermione?

613
01:05:28.079 --> 01:05:31.079
Parvati said she wouldn't
come out of the bathroom.

614
01:05:31.279 --> 01:05:35.173
She said that she'd been in there
all afternoon, crying.

615
01:05:39.406 --> 01:05:42.952
Troll in the dungeon!

616
01:05:43.150 --> 01:05:46.346
Troll in the dungeon!

617
01:05:49.070 --> 01:05:51.273
Thought you ought to know.

618
01:05:57.932 --> 01:06:00.616
Silence!

619
01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:06.019
Everyone will please not panic!

620
01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:08.194
Now...

621
01:06:08.396 --> 01:06:12.770
...prefects will lead their house
back to the dormitories.

622
01:06:13.388 --> 01:06:18.057
Teachers will follow me
to the dungeons.

623
01:06:28.650 --> 01:06:31.683
Gryffindors, keep up, please,
and stay alert.

624
01:06:31.882 --> 01:06:33.573
How could a troll get in?

625
01:06:33.770 --> 01:06:38.723
Not on its own. Trolls are really stupid.
Probably people playing jokes.

626
01:06:38.921 --> 01:06:42.750
- What?
- Hermione! She doesn't know.

627
01:06:54.312 --> 01:06:57.443
I think the troll's left the dungeon.

628
01:07:01.159 --> 01:07:03.232
It's going into the girls' bathroom.

629
01:07:33.028 --> 01:07:35.265
Hermione, move!

630
01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:42.526
Help! Help!

631
01:07:44.420 --> 01:07:46.427
Hey, pea brain!

632
01:07:58.307 --> 01:08:00.129
Help!

633
01:08:20.416 --> 01:08:22.653
Do something!

634
01:08:24.064 --> 01:08:27.861
- What?
- Anything!

635
01:08:28.448 --> 01:08:30.814
- Hurry up!
- Swish and flick.

636
01:08:31.008 --> 01:08:33.179
Wingardium Leviosa.

637
01:08:43.710 --> 01:08:45.620
Cool.

638
01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:11.737
Is it dead?

639
01:09:11.932 --> 01:09:15.707
I don't think so. Just knocked out.

640
01:09:21.723 --> 01:09:23.960
Troll boogers.

641
01:09:26.299 --> 01:09:29.746
Oh, my goodness!
Explain yourselves, both of you!

642
01:09:29.946 --> 01:09:34.354
- Well, what it is--
- It's my fault, Professor McGonagall.

643
01:09:36.474 --> 01:09:37.619
Miss Granger?

644
01:09:38.458 --> 01:09:43.346
I went looking for the troll.
I thought I could handle it.

645
01:09:43.545 --> 01:09:45.367
But I was wrong.

646
01:09:45.561 --> 01:09:50.350
If Harry and Ron hadn't come
and found me, I'd probably be dead.

647
01:09:51.289 --> 01:09:55.599
Be that as it may, it was
an extremely foolish thing to do.

648
01:09:55.800 --> 01:10:01.201
I expected more rational behavior
and am very disappointed in you.

649
01:10:01.399 --> 01:10:04.301
Five points will be taken
from Gryffindor...

650
01:10:04.503 --> 01:10:07.918
...for your serious lack of judgment.

651
01:10:08.375 --> 01:10:10.284
As for you two gentlemen...

652
01:10:10.487 --> 01:10:13.782
...I just hope you realize
how fortunate you are.

653
01:10:13.975 --> 01:10:17.270
Not many first-year students
could take on a troll...

654
01:10:17.463 --> 01:10:19.983
...and live to tell the tale.

655
01:10:20.182 --> 01:10:22.549
Five points...

656
01:10:23.862 --> 01:10:26.862
...will be awarded to each of you...

657
01:10:28.374 --> 01:10:31.276
...for sheer dumb luck.

658
01:10:36.693 --> 01:10:40.238
Perhaps you ought to go.
It might wake up.

659
01:10:47.845 --> 01:10:50.463
Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on.

660
01:10:50.661 --> 01:10:53.759
Ron's right.
You'll need your strength today.

661
01:10:53.957 --> 01:10:56.062
I'm not hungry.

662
01:10:56.612 --> 01:11:01.980
Good luck today, Potter.
You've proven yourself against a troll.

663
01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:05.278
A game of Quidditch
should be easy work.

664
01:11:05.476 --> 01:11:08.410
Even if it is against Slytherin.

665
01:11:15.843 --> 01:11:19.105
- That explains the blood.
- Blood?

666
01:11:19.523 --> 01:11:23.483
Last night, I'm guessing Snape let
the troll in as a diversion...

667
01:11:23.683 --> 01:11:26.170
...so he could get past that dog.

668
01:11:26.370 --> 01:11:29.053
But he got bit,
that's why he's limping.

669
01:11:29.249 --> 01:11:31.867
But why would anyone go near that dog?

670
01:11:32.066 --> 01:11:35.164
At Gringotts, Hagrid took
something out of the vault.

671
01:11:35.361 --> 01:11:38.492
Said it was Hogwarts business,
very secret.

672
01:11:38.689 --> 01:11:39.802
You're saying--

673
01:11:40.001 --> 01:11:44.256
That's what the dog's guarding.
That's what Snape wants.

674
01:11:56.895 --> 01:12:00.692
- Bit early for mail, isn't it?
- But I never get mail.

675
01:12:01.183 --> 01:12:02.677
Let's open it.

676
01:12:12.414 --> 01:12:13.658
It's a broomstick.

677
01:12:14.398 --> 01:12:18.391
That's not just a broomstick,
it's a Nimbus 2000!

678
01:12:19.773 --> 01:12:21.748
But who--?

679
01:12:42.459 --> 01:12:44.914
- Scared, Harry?
- A little.

680
01:12:45.116 --> 01:12:48.628
It's all right. I felt the same way
before my first game.

681
01:12:48.827 --> 01:12:52.122
- What happened?
- I don't really remember.

682
01:12:52.475 --> 01:12:54.995
I took a Bludger to the head
two minutes in.

683
01:12:55.194 --> 01:12:57.943
Woke up in hospital a week later.

684
01:13:19.192 --> 01:13:22.453
Welcome to Hogwarts' first
Quidditch game of the season.

685
01:13:22.648 --> 01:13:27.121
Today's game,
Slytherin versus Gryffindor!

686
01:13:56.213 --> 01:13:58.547
The players take their positions...

687
01:13:58.740 --> 01:14:02.384
...as Madam Hooch steps onto
the field to begin the game!

688
01:14:02.580 --> 01:14:05.809
Now, I want a nice, clean game...

689
01:14:06.356 --> 01:14:08.723
...from all of you!

690
01:14:13.651 --> 01:14:16.433
The Bludgers are up,
followed by the Golden Snitch.

691
01:14:16.627 --> 01:14:19.245
Remember, the Snitch
is worth 150 points.

692
01:14:19.443 --> 01:14:23.087
The Seeker who catches the Snitch
ends the game.

693
01:14:28.978 --> 01:14:33.288
The Quaffle is released
and the game begins!

694
01:14:50.865 --> 01:14:55.403
Angelina Johnson scores!
Ten points for Gryffindor!

695
01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:01.643
Well done!

696
01:15:05.839 --> 01:15:11.272
Slytherin takes the Quaffle.
Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.

697
01:15:42.028 --> 01:15:44.745
Another 10 points to Gryffindor!

698
01:15:57.963 --> 01:15:59.751
Give me that!

699
01:16:29.928 --> 01:16:32.415
Take that side!

700
01:17:19.875 --> 01:17:22.974
What's going on
with Harry's broomstick?

701
01:17:31.554 --> 01:17:33.693
It's Snape.
He's jinxing the broom!

702
01:17:33.890 --> 01:17:38.080
- Jinxing the broom? What do we do?
- Leave it to me.

703
01:17:58.944 --> 01:18:00.373
Come on, Hermione!

704
01:18:13.951 --> 01:18:17.529
Lacarnum Inflamarae.

705
01:18:24.318 --> 01:18:27.220
Fire! You're on fire!

706
01:18:44.380 --> 01:18:46.420
Go, go, go, go!

707
01:19:36.312 --> 01:19:38.581
Looks like he's gonna be sick.

708
01:19:39.608 --> 01:19:41.037
He's got the Snitch!

709
01:19:41.239 --> 01:19:45.101
Harry Potter receives 150 points
for catching the Snitch!

710
01:19:45.303 --> 01:19:46.928
Gryffindor wins!

711
01:20:28.755 --> 01:20:32.814
Nonsense! Why would Snape
put a curse on Harry's broom?

712
01:20:33.011 --> 01:20:36.786
Who knows? Why was he trying
to get past that three-headed dog?

713
01:20:36.978 --> 01:20:39.280
- Who told you about Fluffy?
- Fluffy?

714
01:20:39.475 --> 01:20:43.020
- That thing has a name?
- Of course he has a name. He's mine.

715
01:20:43.217 --> 01:20:48.302
I bought him off an Irishman.
I lent him to Dumbledore to guard--

716
01:20:48.497 --> 01:20:52.872
Shouldn't have said that.
No more questions! That's top-secret.

717
01:20:53.457 --> 01:20:57.286
But whatever Fluffy's guarding,
Snape's trying to steal it.

718
01:20:57.489 --> 01:21:00.805
Codswallop. Professor Snape
is a Hogwarts teacher.

719
01:21:01.297 --> 01:21:06.184
Teacher or not, I know a spell when
I see one. I've read all about them.

720
01:21:06.384 --> 01:21:09.831
You've got to keep eye contact,
and Snape wasn't blinking.

721
01:21:10.032 --> 01:21:12.137
Exactly.

722
01:21:12.816 --> 01:21:15.466
Now, you listen to me,
all three of you.

723
01:21:15.663 --> 01:21:20.103
You're meddling in things that ought
not to be meddled in. It's dangerous.

724
01:21:20.302 --> 01:21:25.190
What that dog is guarding is
between Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.

725
01:21:25.390 --> 01:21:26.765
Nicholas Flamel?

726
01:21:27.726 --> 01:21:32.199
I shouldn't have said that.
I should not have said that.

727
01:21:32.398 --> 01:21:36.391
Nicholas Flamel.
Who's Nicholas Flamel?

728
01:21:36.589 --> 01:21:38.476
I don't know.

729
01:21:56.556 --> 01:21:59.272
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas

730
01:21:59.467 --> 01:22:02.184
Ring the Hogwart bell

731
01:22:02.379 --> 01:22:05.030
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas

732
01:22:05.227 --> 01:22:08.074
Cast a Christmas spell

733
01:22:21.129 --> 01:22:24.325
Knight to E-5.

734
01:22:31.688 --> 01:22:33.760
Queen to E-5.

735
01:22:39.144 --> 01:22:40.900
That's totally barbaric!

736
01:22:41.095 --> 01:22:44.510
That's wizard's chess.
I see you've packed.

737
01:22:44.712 --> 01:22:46.086
I see you haven't.

738
01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:51.393
Change of plans. My parents went
to Romania to visit my brother Charlie.

739
01:22:51.591 --> 01:22:55.235
- He's studying dragons there.
- Good. You can help Harry.

740
01:22:55.431 --> 01:22:58.726
He's going to the library
to look up Nicholas Flamel.

741
01:22:58.919 --> 01:23:02.235
We've looked a hundred times!

742
01:23:02.886 --> 01:23:07.904
Not in the restricted section.
Happy Christmas.

743
01:23:10.053 --> 01:23:12.835
I think we've had
a bad influence on her.

744
01:23:15.237 --> 01:23:19.427
Harry, wake up!
Come on, Harry, wake up!

745
01:23:28.899 --> 01:23:32.063
- Happy Christmas, Harry.
- Happy Christmas, Ron.

746
01:23:32.260 --> 01:23:34.365
What are you wearing?

747
01:23:34.979 --> 01:23:38.492
Oh, my mum made it.
Looks like you've got one too.

748
01:23:39.587 --> 01:23:41.921
- I've got presents?
- Yeah.

749
01:23:49.026 --> 01:23:51.033
There they are.

750
01:24:01.601 --> 01:24:04.950
"Your father left this
in my possession before he died.

751
01:24:05.153 --> 01:24:09.113
It is time it was returned to you.
Use it well."

752
01:24:25.278 --> 01:24:28.824
- What is it?
- Some kind of cloak.

753
01:24:29.118 --> 01:24:31.933
Well, let's see, then. Put it on.

754
01:24:37.085 --> 01:24:38.329
My body's gone!

755
01:24:38.526 --> 01:24:41.973
I know what that is.
That's an invisibility cloak!

756
01:24:42.493 --> 01:24:44.315
I'm invisible?

757
01:24:44.797 --> 01:24:49.052
They're really rare.
I wonder who gave it to you.

758
01:24:49.437 --> 01:24:54.073
There was no name.
It just said, "Use it well."

759
01:25:20.986 --> 01:25:26.615
Famous Fire-Eaters.
Fifteenth-Century Fiends.

760
01:25:26.809 --> 01:25:32.373
Flamel. Nicholas Flamel.
Where are you?

761
01:25:50.488 --> 01:25:52.276
Who's there?

762
01:25:58.167 --> 01:26:03.568
I know you're in there.
You can't hide.

763
01:26:10.678 --> 01:26:14.223
Who is it? Show yourself.

764
01:26:59.473 --> 01:27:00.815
Severus, I....

765
01:27:01.457 --> 01:27:05.167
You don't want me
as your enemy, Quirrell.

766
01:27:05.361 --> 01:27:09.900
- I don't know what you mean.
- You know perfectly well what I mean.

767
01:27:26.415 --> 01:27:29.513
We'll have another little chat soon.

768
01:27:29.711 --> 01:27:34.948
When you've had time to decide
where your loyalties lie.

769
01:27:35.150 --> 01:27:39.427
Professors. I found this
in the restricted section.

770
01:27:39.950 --> 01:27:44.771
It's still hot. That means
there's a student out of bed.

771
01:29:13.062 --> 01:29:14.850
Mum?

772
01:29:17.957 --> 01:29:19.899
Dad?

773
01:29:53.154 --> 01:29:57.943
Ron, you've really gotta see this!
Ron, you've gotta see this!

774
01:29:59.714 --> 01:30:02.496
Ron, come on, get out of bed!

775
01:30:02.690 --> 01:30:06.072
- Why?
- There's something you've got to see!

776
01:30:12.577 --> 01:30:16.668
Come on! Come!
Come look, it's my parents!

777
01:30:18.048 --> 01:30:19.958
I only see us.

778
01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:23.389
Look in properly.
Go on, stand there.

779
01:30:23.584 --> 01:30:29.246
- There. You see them, don't you?
- That's me! Only I'm head boy.

780
01:30:29.759 --> 01:30:31.996
And I'm holding the Quidditch Cup.

781
01:30:32.191 --> 01:30:36.217
And bloody hell!
I'm Quidditch captain too!

782
01:30:37.343 --> 01:30:39.677
I look good.

783
01:30:40.286 --> 01:30:43.962
Harry, do you think this mirror
shows the future?

784
01:30:44.158 --> 01:30:48.914
How can it?
Both my parents are dead.

785
01:31:11.067 --> 01:31:13.140
Back again, Harry?

786
01:31:16.156 --> 01:31:18.544
I see that you,
like many before you...

787
01:31:18.715 --> 01:31:22.741
...have discovered the delights
of the Mirror of Erised.

788
01:31:23.034 --> 01:31:27.027
I trust by now
you realize what it does.

789
01:31:28.314 --> 01:31:30.736
Let me give you a clue.

790
01:31:31.258 --> 01:31:33.330
The happiest man on earth...

791
01:31:33.497 --> 01:31:36.759
...would look in the mirror
and see only himself...

792
01:31:36.953 --> 01:31:39.190
...exactly as he is.

793
01:31:39.385 --> 01:31:44.273
So then, it shows us what we want.
Whatever we want.

794
01:31:44.441 --> 01:31:47.026
Yes. And no.

795
01:31:48.025 --> 01:31:50.446
It shows us nothing more or less...

796
01:31:50.616 --> 01:31:56.332
...than the deepest and most desperate
desires of our hearts.

797
01:31:56.535 --> 01:32:01.041
Now you, Harry, who have
never known your family...

798
01:32:01.239 --> 01:32:04.981
...you see them standing beside you.

799
01:32:05.175 --> 01:32:07.541
But remember this, Harry.

800
01:32:07.735 --> 01:32:13.364
This mirror gives us
neither knowledge...

801
01:32:13.558 --> 01:32:15.532
...or truth.

802
01:32:16.533 --> 01:32:22.250
Men have wasted away in front of it.
Even gone mad.

803
01:32:23.285 --> 01:32:27.279
That is why tomorrow,
it will be moved to a new home.

804
01:32:27.477 --> 01:32:29.332
And I must ask you...

805
01:32:30.197 --> 01:32:33.971
...not to go looking for it again.

806
01:32:34.676 --> 01:32:37.676
It does not do to dwell on dreams...

807
01:32:38.196 --> 01:32:40.978
...and forget to live.

808
01:33:33.455 --> 01:33:38.889
I had you looking in the wrong section.
How could I be so stupid?

809
01:33:39.119 --> 01:33:42.086
I checked this out weeks ago
for a bit of light reading.

810
01:33:42.286 --> 01:33:44.196
This is light?

811
01:33:48.718 --> 01:33:50.693
Of course! Here it is!

812
01:33:51.246 --> 01:33:54.988
Nicholas Flamel is the only known
maker of the Philosopher's Stone.

813
01:33:55.181 --> 01:33:56.326
The what?

814
01:33:56.973 --> 01:33:59.842
Honestly, don't you two read?

815
01:34:00.045 --> 01:34:04.420
"The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary
substance with astonishing powers.

816
01:34:04.589 --> 01:34:07.076
It'll transform any metal
into pure gold...

817
01:34:07.276 --> 01:34:11.105
...and produces the Elixir of Life
which will make the drinker immortal."

818
01:34:11.308 --> 01:34:13.447
- Immortal?
- It means you'll never die.

819
01:34:13.612 --> 01:34:15.619
I know what it means!

820
01:34:16.427 --> 01:34:20.999
"The only Stone currently in existence
belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel...

821
01:34:21.195 --> 01:34:26.083
...the noted alchemist who last year
celebrated his 665th birthday."

822
01:34:27.786 --> 01:34:29.858
That's what Fluffy's guarding.

823
01:34:30.026 --> 01:34:34.565
That's what's under the trap door.
The Philosopher's Stone.

824
01:34:50.665 --> 01:34:54.341
Don't wish to be rude,
but I'm in no state to entertain.

825
01:34:54.504 --> 01:34:57.122
We know about the Philosopher's Stone.

826
01:35:01.639 --> 01:35:06.560
- We think Snape's trying to steal it.
- Are you still on about him?

827
01:35:06.727 --> 01:35:09.411
We know he's after it.
We don't know why.

828
01:35:09.799 --> 01:35:14.076
Snape is one of the teachers
protecting the Stone. He won't steal it.

829
01:35:14.215 --> 01:35:15.163
What?

830
01:35:15.302 --> 01:35:18.466
You heard. Come on,
I'm a bit preoccupied today.

831
01:35:18.854 --> 01:35:21.309
Wait a minute.
"One of the teachers"?

832
01:35:21.478 --> 01:35:25.220
There are other things
defending the Stone, aren't there?

833
01:35:25.381 --> 01:35:27.901
- Spells, enchantments.
- Right.

834
01:35:28.102 --> 01:35:31.036
Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.

835
01:35:31.237 --> 01:35:33.212
Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy.

836
01:35:33.477 --> 01:35:36.989
Ain't a soul knows how,
except for me and Dumbledore.

837
01:35:37.189 --> 01:35:40.636
I shouldn't have told you that.
I should not have told you that.

838
01:35:53.923 --> 01:35:58.811
- Hagrid, what exactly is that?
- That? It's....

839
01:35:59.011 --> 01:36:00.985
I know what that is!

840
01:36:01.154 --> 01:36:03.707
But, Hagrid, how did you get one?

841
01:36:04.002 --> 01:36:07.166
I won it. Off a stranger
I met down at the pub.

842
01:36:07.330 --> 01:36:11.290
Seemed quite glad to be rid of it,
as a matter of fact.

843
01:36:32.608 --> 01:36:34.746
Is that...

844
01:36:35.488 --> 01:36:36.633
...a dragon?

845
01:36:36.831 --> 01:36:41.053
That's not just a dragon.
That's a Norwegian Ridgeback.

846
01:36:41.247 --> 01:36:43.996
My brother works
with these in Romania.

847
01:36:44.158 --> 01:36:48.893
Isn't he beautiful? Oh, bless him.
Look, he knows his mummy.

848
01:36:49.502 --> 01:36:51.160
Hello, Norbert.

849
01:36:51.550 --> 01:36:55.641
- Norbert?
- He's gotta have a name, don't he?

850
01:36:56.318 --> 01:36:58.707
Don't you, Norbert?

851
01:37:05.373 --> 01:37:08.406
He'll have to be trained up a bit,
of course.

852
01:37:12.092 --> 01:37:14.066
Who's that?

853
01:37:15.771 --> 01:37:17.779
Malfoy.

854
01:37:18.492 --> 01:37:19.834
Oh, dear.

855
01:37:21.435 --> 01:37:26.072
Hagrid always wanted a dragon.
Told me so the first time I met him.

856
01:37:26.267 --> 01:37:30.162
It's crazy.
And worse, Malfoy knows.

857
01:37:30.330 --> 01:37:34.258
- I don't understand. Is that bad?
- It's bad.

858
01:37:34.586 --> 01:37:36.626
Good evening.

859
01:37:40.122 --> 01:37:42.937
Nothing, I repeat, nothing...

860
01:37:43.130 --> 01:37:46.577
...gives a student the right
to walk about at night.

861
01:37:46.745 --> 01:37:51.381
Therefore, as punishment for your actions,
50 points will be taken.

862
01:37:51.577 --> 01:37:53.846
- 50?!
- Each.

863
01:37:54.840 --> 01:37:57.142
To ensure it doesn't happen again...

864
01:37:57.304 --> 01:38:00.468
...all four of you
will receive detention.

865
01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:04.247
Excuse me, professor,
perhaps I heard you wrong.

866
01:38:04.408 --> 01:38:06.742
I thought you said the four of us.

867
01:38:06.903 --> 01:38:09.237
No, you heard me correctly.

868
01:38:09.431 --> 01:38:14.253
Honorable as your intentions were,
you too were out of bed after hours.

869
01:38:14.743 --> 01:38:17.557
You will join your classmates
in detention.

870
01:38:28.310 --> 01:38:32.139
A pity they let
the old punishments die.

871
01:38:32.341 --> 01:38:36.880
Was a time detention found you
hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons.

872
01:38:37.077 --> 01:38:39.793
God, I miss the screaming.

873
01:38:42.261 --> 01:38:45.424
You'll be serving detention
with Hagrid tonight.

874
01:38:45.588 --> 01:38:50.738
He's got a little job to do
inside the Dark Forest.

875
01:38:52.723 --> 01:38:55.538
A sorry lot, this, Hagrid.

876
01:38:56.947 --> 01:39:01.736
Good God, you're not still on
about that bloody dragon, are you?

877
01:39:03.923 --> 01:39:05.930
Norbert's gone.

878
01:39:06.386 --> 01:39:09.834
Dumbledore sent him off to Romania
to live in a colony.

879
01:39:10.066 --> 01:39:13.229
That's good, isn't it?
He's with his own kind.

880
01:39:13.362 --> 01:39:15.663
What if he don't like Romania?

881
01:39:15.825 --> 01:39:19.916
What if the other dragons are mean
to him? He's only a baby.

882
01:39:20.497 --> 01:39:25.582
For God's sake, pull yourself together.
You're going into the Forest.

883
01:39:25.776 --> 01:39:28.045
Got to have your wits about you.

884
01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:33.673
The Forest? I thought that was a joke.
We can't go in there.

885
01:39:34.064 --> 01:39:37.806
Students aren't allowed.
And there are...

886
01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:40.457
...werewolves.

887
01:39:40.879 --> 01:39:44.010
There's more than werewolves
in those trees.

888
01:39:44.207 --> 01:39:46.792
You can be sure of that.

889
01:39:48.687 --> 01:39:49.996
Nighty-night.

890
01:39:52.462 --> 01:39:55.593
Right. Let's go.

891
01:40:31.883 --> 01:40:34.185
Hagrid, what is that?

892
01:40:34.378 --> 01:40:37.640
What we're here for.
See that?

893
01:40:38.059 --> 01:40:43.274
That's unicorn blood, that is.
I found one dead a few weeks ago.

894
01:40:43.786 --> 01:40:48.161
Now, this one's been hurt bad
by something.

895
01:40:55.401 --> 01:41:00.899
So, it's our job to go
and find the poor beast.

896
01:41:01.097 --> 01:41:04.064
Ron, Hermione, come with me.

897
01:41:04.552 --> 01:41:07.716
And, Harry, you'll go with Malfoy.

898
01:41:09.128 --> 01:41:11.135
Okay. Then I get Fang.

899
01:41:11.271 --> 01:41:16.770
Fine. Just so you know,
he's a bloody coward.

900
01:41:20.327 --> 01:41:25.083
Wait till my father hears about this.
This is servant's stuff.

901
01:41:25.254 --> 01:41:29.050
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were scared.

902
01:41:29.254 --> 01:41:32.036
I'm not scared, Potter.

903
01:41:32.837 --> 01:41:34.725
Do you hear that?

904
01:41:37.093 --> 01:41:38.500
Come on, Fang.

905
01:41:38.693 --> 01:41:40.067
Scared!

906
01:42:04.131 --> 01:42:06.236
What is it, Fang?

907
01:43:13.725 --> 01:43:18.994
Harry Potter, you must leave.
You are known to many creatures here.

908
01:43:19.196 --> 01:43:23.058
The Forest is not safe at this time.
Especially for you.

909
01:43:23.260 --> 01:43:25.878
What was that thing you saved me from?

910
01:43:26.044 --> 01:43:31.194
A monstrous creature.
It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn.

911
01:43:31.388 --> 01:43:36.722
Drinking its blood will keep you alive
even if you are an inch from death.

912
01:43:36.923 --> 01:43:41.811
But at a terrible price. For you
have slain something so pure...

913
01:43:41.978 --> 01:43:46.680
...that the moment the blood touches
your lips, you will have a half-life.

914
01:43:46.842 --> 01:43:48.631
A cursed life.

915
01:43:48.794 --> 01:43:52.568
- Who would choose such a life?
- Can you think of no one?

916
01:43:52.762 --> 01:43:57.518
Do you mean to say that
that thing that killed the unicorn...

917
01:43:57.849 --> 01:44:01.646
...that was drinking its blood,
that was Voldemort?

918
01:44:01.816 --> 01:44:06.769
Do you know what is hidden
in the school at this very moment?

919
01:44:07.576 --> 01:44:09.005
The Philosopher's Stone.

920
01:44:10.296 --> 01:44:12.206
Harry!

921
01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:17.069
Hello there, Firenze.
See you've met our young Mr. Potter.

922
01:44:17.272 --> 01:44:19.312
You all right there, Harry?

923
01:44:20.471 --> 01:44:24.562
Harry Potter,
this is where I leave you.

924
01:44:25.431 --> 01:44:29.107
You're safe now. Good luck.

925
01:44:36.277 --> 01:44:40.368
You mean, You-Know-Who is out there
right now in the Forest?

926
01:44:40.533 --> 01:44:43.283
But he's weak.
He's living off the unicorns.

927
01:44:43.446 --> 01:44:46.260
Don't you see? We had it wrong.

928
01:44:46.453 --> 01:44:50.643
Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself.
He wants it for Voldemort.

929
01:44:50.836 --> 01:44:55.211
With the Elixir of Life,
Voldemort will be strong again.

930
01:44:55.412 --> 01:44:56.907
He'll come back.

931
01:44:57.076 --> 01:44:58.800
But if he comes back...

932
01:44:58.996 --> 01:45:02.825
...you don't think he'll try
to kill you, do you?

933
01:45:03.796 --> 01:45:07.211
If he'd had the chance,
he might have tried tonight.

934
01:45:07.411 --> 01:45:10.858
And to think I've been worrying
about my Potions final.

935
01:45:11.027 --> 01:45:14.475
Hang on a minute.
We're forgetting one thing.

936
01:45:14.834 --> 01:45:19.471
Who's the one wizard
Voldemort always feared?

937
01:45:20.242 --> 01:45:25.162
Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore
is around, Harry, you're safe.

938
01:45:25.362 --> 01:45:29.223
As long as Dumbledore is around,
you can't be touched.

939
01:45:34.769 --> 01:45:39.951
I'd heard Hogwarts' final exams were
frightful, but I found that enjoyable.

940
01:45:40.144 --> 01:45:43.689
Speak for yourself.
All right there, Harry?

941
01:45:43.888 --> 01:45:48.841
- My scar. It keeps burning.
- It's happened before.

942
01:45:49.039 --> 01:45:51.625
- Not like this.
- You should see the nurse.

943
01:45:51.823 --> 01:45:55.118
I think it's a warning.
It means danger's coming.

944
01:46:02.478 --> 01:46:04.845
- Of course!
- What is it?

945
01:46:05.039 --> 01:46:08.683
Isn't it odd that what Hagrid wants
more than anything is a dragon...

946
01:46:08.846 --> 01:46:11.780
...and a stranger just happens
to have one?

947
01:46:11.950 --> 01:46:14.600
How many people wander around
with dragon eggs?

948
01:46:14.765 --> 01:46:16.936
Why didn't I see it before?

949
01:46:22.284 --> 01:46:25.633
Who gave you the egg?
What did he look like?

950
01:46:25.836 --> 01:46:28.520
I never saw his face.
He kept his hood up.

951
01:46:28.684 --> 01:46:31.105
You and this stranger
must have talked.

952
01:46:31.723 --> 01:46:35.171
He wanted to know what sort
of creatures I looked after.

953
01:46:35.340 --> 01:46:39.169
I said, "After Fluffy,
a dragon's gonna be no problem."

954
01:46:39.340 --> 01:46:43.616
- Was he interested in Fluffy?
- Of course he was interested.

955
01:46:44.042 --> 01:46:48.035
How often do you come across
a three-headed dog?

956
01:46:48.202 --> 01:46:53.636
But I told him, "The trick with any beast
is to know how to calm him."

957
01:46:53.834 --> 01:46:59.049
Take Fluffy, for example. Play him
music and he falls straight to sleep.

958
01:47:00.649 --> 01:47:03.267
I shouldn't have told you that.

959
01:47:03.433 --> 01:47:05.572
Where are you going?

960
01:47:12.264 --> 01:47:14.915
We have to see Dumbledore.
Immediately!

961
01:47:15.304 --> 01:47:17.857
I'm afraid he's not here.

962
01:47:18.056 --> 01:47:22.146
He received an urgent owl
from the Ministry of Magic and left.

963
01:47:22.599 --> 01:47:25.446
He's gone?
But this is important!

964
01:47:25.639 --> 01:47:28.988
This is about the Philosopher's Stone!

965
01:47:29.191 --> 01:47:32.802
- How do you know--?
- Someone's going to try and steal it.

966
01:47:33.383 --> 01:47:38.401
I don't know how you know,
but I assure you it is well protected.

967
01:47:38.598 --> 01:47:42.722
Now would you go back
to your dormitories? Quietly.

968
01:47:50.661 --> 01:47:53.378
That was no stranger Hagrid met.
It was Snape.

969
01:47:53.541 --> 01:47:56.061
Which means he knows
how to get past Fluffy.

970
01:47:56.260 --> 01:48:00.002
- And with Dumbledore gone--
- Good afternoon.

971
01:48:01.956 --> 01:48:05.184
What would three young Gryffindors...

972
01:48:05.316 --> 01:48:09.887
...be doing inside on a day like this?

973
01:48:13.891 --> 01:48:17.240
- We were just--
- You ought to be careful.

974
01:48:17.795 --> 01:48:19.704
People will think you're...

975
01:48:23.810 --> 01:48:26.363
...up to something.

976
01:48:36.289 --> 01:48:38.176
Now what do we do?

977
01:48:38.369 --> 01:48:42.013
We go down the trap door. Tonight.

978
01:48:55.167 --> 01:48:56.596
Trevor.

979
01:48:56.895 --> 01:49:00.157
Trevor, go! You shouldn't be here!

980
01:49:00.415 --> 01:49:05.652
Neither should you.
You're sneaking out again, aren't you?

981
01:49:05.822 --> 01:49:09.619
- Neville, listen. We were--
- No, I won't let you!

982
01:49:09.886 --> 01:49:14.261
You'll get Gryffindor into trouble again.
I'll fight you.

983
01:49:14.462 --> 01:49:19.764
Neville, I'm really sorry about this.
Petrificus Totalus.

984
01:49:26.205 --> 01:49:29.882
You're a little scary sometimes,
you know that?

985
01:49:30.076 --> 01:49:33.589
Brilliant, but scary.

986
01:49:34.172 --> 01:49:36.212
Let's go.

987
01:49:36.379 --> 01:49:40.470
- Sorry.
- It's for your own good, you know.

988
01:49:45.659 --> 01:49:49.456
- You stood on my foot!
- Sorry.

989
01:49:53.146 --> 01:49:55.088
Alohomora.

990
01:50:06.649 --> 01:50:09.070
Wait a minute. He's...

991
01:50:10.297 --> 01:50:11.987
...snoring.

992
01:50:14.776 --> 01:50:20.046
Snape's already been here.
He's put a spell on the harp.

993
01:50:21.624 --> 01:50:24.493
It's got horrible breath.

994
01:50:26.936 --> 01:50:28.943
- We have to move its paw.
- What?

995
01:50:29.143 --> 01:50:30.550
Come on!

996
01:50:34.422 --> 01:50:36.397
Okay. Push.

997
01:50:58.613 --> 01:51:02.093
I'll go first. Don't follow
until I give you a sign.

998
01:51:02.260 --> 01:51:07.082
If something bad happens,
get yourselves out.

999
01:51:07.860 --> 01:51:11.155
Does it seem a bit quiet to you?

1000
01:51:11.859 --> 01:51:13.615
The harp.

1001
01:51:14.259 --> 01:51:16.845
It's stopped playing.

1002
01:51:26.738 --> 01:51:28.396
Jump!

1003
01:51:41.169 --> 01:51:44.649
Lucky this plant thing's here, really.

1004
01:51:58.480 --> 01:52:01.479
Stop moving, both of you.
This is Devil's Snare.

1005
01:52:01.647 --> 01:52:05.225
You have to relax. If you don't,
it will only kill you faster.

1006
01:52:05.391 --> 01:52:10.147
Kill us faster?
Oh, now I can relax!

1007
01:52:12.366 --> 01:52:13.643
Hermione!

1008
01:52:14.158 --> 01:52:17.834
- Now what are we gonna do?
- Just relax!

1009
01:52:18.030 --> 01:52:22.307
- Hermione, where are you?
- Do what I say! Trust me.

1010
01:52:29.165 --> 01:52:32.361
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1011
01:52:32.556 --> 01:52:35.491
- He's not relaxing, is he?
- Apparently not.

1012
01:52:35.692 --> 01:52:38.081
- We've gotta do something.
- What?

1013
01:52:38.284 --> 01:52:41.131
I remember reading something
in Herbology.

1014
01:52:41.932 --> 01:52:45.641
Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare.
It's deadly fun...

1015
01:52:45.835 --> 01:52:50.025
...but will sulk in the sun!
That's it! It hates sunlight.

1016
01:52:50.283 --> 01:52:52.257
Lumus Solem.

1017
01:52:59.978 --> 01:53:02.465
- Ron, you okay?
- Yeah.

1018
01:53:05.033 --> 01:53:07.422
Lucky we didn't panic.

1019
01:53:08.169 --> 01:53:11.518
Lucky Hermione pays attention
in Herbology.

1020
01:53:13.065 --> 01:53:14.526
What is that?

1021
01:53:14.728 --> 01:53:18.372
I don't know. Sounds like wings.

1022
01:53:30.888 --> 01:53:34.204
Curious. I've never seen
birds like these.

1023
01:53:34.407 --> 01:53:37.887
They're not birds.
They're keys.

1024
01:53:38.087 --> 01:53:41.403
And I'll bet one of them
fits that door.

1025
01:53:44.742 --> 01:53:49.149
- What's this all about?
- I don't know.

1026
01:53:54.790 --> 01:53:56.764
Strange.

1027
01:53:57.125 --> 01:53:59.361
Alohomora!

1028
01:54:02.149 --> 01:54:04.385
Well, it was worth a try.

1029
01:54:04.581 --> 01:54:07.679
What will we do?
There must be a thousand keys.

1030
01:54:07.877 --> 01:54:11.651
We want a big, old-fashioned one.
Probably rusty.

1031
01:54:11.844 --> 01:54:15.073
I see it!
The one with the broken wing.

1032
01:54:18.563 --> 01:54:20.800
What's wrong?

1033
01:54:21.635 --> 01:54:23.042
It's too simple.

1034
01:54:23.235 --> 01:54:27.872
Go on! If Snape could catch it
on that old broomstick, you can.

1035
01:54:28.035 --> 01:54:31.450
You're the youngest Seeker
in a century.

1036
01:54:47.585 --> 01:54:50.487
This complicates things a bit.

1037
01:55:10.878 --> 01:55:12.983
Catch the key!

1038
01:55:16.927 --> 01:55:18.781
Hurry up!

1039
01:55:49.916 --> 01:55:54.454
I don't like this.
I don't like this at all.

1040
01:55:54.651 --> 01:55:57.651
Where are we? A graveyard.

1041
01:55:58.011 --> 01:56:00.531
This is no graveyard.

1042
01:56:07.738 --> 01:56:10.552
It's a chessboard.

1043
01:56:22.009 --> 01:56:23.864
There's the door.

1044
01:56:35.448 --> 01:56:36.877
Now what do we do?

1045
01:56:37.175 --> 01:56:41.201
It's obvious, isn't it? We've got
to play our way across the room.

1046
01:56:41.751 --> 01:56:45.329
Harry, you take
the empty bishop's square.

1047
01:56:45.687 --> 01:56:49.712
Hermione, you'll be
the queen-side castle.

1048
01:56:49.910 --> 01:56:53.838
As for me, I'll be a knight.

1049
01:57:00.693 --> 01:57:02.351
What happens now?

1050
01:57:03.061 --> 01:57:05.963
Well, white moves first.

1051
01:57:06.165 --> 01:57:07.954
And then...

1052
01:57:09.653 --> 01:57:10.863
...we play.

1053
01:57:20.979 --> 01:57:25.867
Ron, you don't suppose
this is going to be like...

1054
01:57:26.067 --> 01:57:29.482
...real wizard's chess, do you?

1055
01:57:29.875 --> 01:57:32.689
You there, D-5.

1056
01:57:46.705 --> 01:57:48.199
Yes, Hermione.

1057
01:57:48.402 --> 01:57:53.257
I think this is gonna be
exactly like wizard's chess.

1058
01:57:58.928 --> 01:58:01.383
Castle to E-4!

1059
01:58:04.848 --> 01:58:06.790
Pawn to C-3!

1060
01:58:49.868 --> 01:58:53.697
- Wait a minute.
- You understand right, Harry.

1061
01:58:53.899 --> 01:58:58.471
Once I make my move,
the queen will take me.

1062
01:58:59.019 --> 01:59:01.321
Then you're free to check the king.

1063
01:59:01.514 --> 01:59:04.035
- No. Ron, no!
- What is it?

1064
01:59:04.715 --> 01:59:09.187
- He's going to sacrifice himself.
- No, there must be another way!

1065
01:59:09.387 --> 01:59:12.932
Do you wanna stop Snape
from getting that Stone or not?

1066
01:59:13.130 --> 01:59:16.610
Harry, it's you that has to go on.
I know it.

1067
01:59:17.066 --> 01:59:19.749
Not me. Not Hermione. You.

1068
01:59:29.576 --> 01:59:32.391
Knight to H-3.

1069
01:59:52.423 --> 01:59:54.332
Check.

1070
02:00:22.308 --> 02:00:24.031
Ron!

1071
02:00:24.227 --> 02:00:29.824
No, don't move!
Don't forget, we're still playing.

1072
02:00:44.194 --> 02:00:45.470
Checkmate.

1073
02:01:04.608 --> 02:01:06.975
Take care of Ron.
Then go to the owlery.

1074
02:01:07.168 --> 02:01:10.877
Send a message to Dumbledore.
Ron's right.

1075
02:01:11.072 --> 02:01:12.894
I have to go on.

1076
02:01:13.408 --> 02:01:19.070
You'll be okay, Harry.
You're a great wizard. You really are.

1077
02:01:19.263 --> 02:01:21.684
Not as good as you.

1078
02:01:22.495 --> 02:01:27.099
Me? Books and cleverness.
There are more important things.

1079
02:01:28.254 --> 02:01:33.688
Friendship and bravery.
And, Harry, just be careful.

1080
02:02:10.203 --> 02:02:11.796
You?

1081
02:02:12.571 --> 02:02:16.215
No, it can't be.
Snape, he was the--

1082
02:02:16.410 --> 02:02:19.377
Yes, he does seem the type,
doesn't he?

1083
02:02:19.578 --> 02:02:22.545
Next to him, who would suspect...

1084
02:02:22.745 --> 02:02:26.520
...poor, stuttering
Professor Quirrell?

1085
02:02:26.713 --> 02:02:31.863
But that day, during the Quidditch match,
Snape tried to kill me.

1086
02:02:32.057 --> 02:02:34.773
No, dear boy. I tried to kill you!

1087
02:02:35.257 --> 02:02:39.217
If Snape's cloak hadn't caught
fire and broken my eye contact...

1088
02:02:39.416 --> 02:02:41.554
...I would have succeeded.

1089
02:02:41.752 --> 02:02:44.653
Even with Snape muttering
his counter-curse.

1090
02:02:44.856 --> 02:02:46.928
Snape was trying to save me?

1091
02:02:47.128 --> 02:02:52.277
I knew you were a danger to me,
especially after Halloween.

1092
02:02:52.471 --> 02:02:56.562
- Then you let the troll in!
- Very good, Potter, yes.

1093
02:02:56.758 --> 02:02:59.628
Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled.

1094
02:03:00.182 --> 02:03:04.916
While everyone ran about,
he went to the third floor to head me off.

1095
02:03:05.845 --> 02:03:09.194
He, of course, never trusted me again.

1096
02:03:10.133 --> 02:03:15.184
He rarely left me alone.
But he doesn't understand.

1097
02:03:15.381 --> 02:03:19.276
I'm never alone. Never.

1098
02:03:19.476 --> 02:03:23.404
Now, what does this mirror do?

1099
02:03:24.884 --> 02:03:26.923
I see what I desire.

1100
02:03:27.476 --> 02:03:31.698
I see myself holding the Stone.
But how do I get it?

1101
02:03:31.892 --> 02:03:33.931
Use the boy.

1102
02:03:34.739 --> 02:03:38.513
Come here, Potter! Now!

1103
02:03:50.066 --> 02:03:53.895
Tell me, what do you see?

1104
02:04:18.064 --> 02:04:20.398
What is it? What do you see?

1105
02:04:20.591 --> 02:04:25.544
I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore.
I've won the house cup.

1106
02:04:25.743 --> 02:04:27.237
He lies.

1107
02:04:27.694 --> 02:04:31.240
Tell the truth! What do you see?

1108
02:04:31.438 --> 02:04:35.660
- Let me speak to him.
- Master, you are not strong enough.

1109
02:04:35.854 --> 02:04:39.749
I have strength enough for this.

1110
02:04:57.196 --> 02:04:59.913
Harry Potter...

1111
02:05:00.108 --> 02:05:02.410
...we meet again.

1112
02:05:02.603 --> 02:05:03.945
Voldemort.

1113
02:05:04.140 --> 02:05:07.914
Yes. You see what I've become?

1114
02:05:08.203 --> 02:05:11.618
See what I must do to survive?

1115
02:05:11.819 --> 02:05:15.779
Live off another. A mere parasite.

1116
02:05:16.427 --> 02:05:19.623
Unicorn blood can sustain me...

1117
02:05:19.819 --> 02:05:23.331
...but it cannot give me
a body of my own.

1118
02:05:23.530 --> 02:05:26.945
But there is something that can.

1119
02:05:27.145 --> 02:05:32.578
Something that, conveniently enough,
lies in your pocket.

1120
02:05:32.841 --> 02:05:34.434
Stop him!

1121
02:05:39.209 --> 02:05:41.859
Don't be a fool.

1122
02:05:42.345 --> 02:05:45.378
Why suffer an horrific death...

1123
02:05:45.576 --> 02:05:49.056
...when you can join me and live?

1124
02:05:49.256 --> 02:05:50.303
Never!

1125
02:05:52.231 --> 02:05:56.803
Bravery. Your parents had it too.

1126
02:05:57.543 --> 02:06:00.707
Tell me, Harry...

1127
02:06:00.902 --> 02:06:04.677
...would you like to see
your mother and father again?

1128
02:06:04.870 --> 02:06:06.845
Together...

1129
02:06:07.046 --> 02:06:09.534
...we can bring them back.

1130
02:06:09.893 --> 02:06:14.400
All I ask is for something in return.

1131
02:06:20.900 --> 02:06:23.835
That's it, Harry.

1132
02:06:24.740 --> 02:06:28.482
There is no good and evil.

1133
02:06:28.677 --> 02:06:31.546
There is only power...

1134
02:06:31.748 --> 02:06:35.676
...and those too weak to seek it.

1135
02:06:36.356 --> 02:06:41.145
Together, we'll do
extraordinary things.

1136
02:06:41.571 --> 02:06:43.742
Just give me the Stone!

1137
02:06:46.211 --> 02:06:47.389
You liar!

1138
02:06:47.586 --> 02:06:49.626
Kill him!

1139
02:07:12.192 --> 02:07:17.309
- What is this magic?
- Fool, get the Stone!

1140
02:08:58.199 --> 02:09:00.654
Good afternoon, Harry.

1141
02:09:02.678 --> 02:09:06.955
- Tokens from your admirers?
- Admirers?

1142
02:09:07.159 --> 02:09:12.941
What happened in the dungeons between
you and Professor Quirrell is a secret.

1143
02:09:13.142 --> 02:09:17.746
So, naturally, the whole school knows.

1144
02:09:19.957 --> 02:09:23.502
I see that your friend Ronald
has saved you the trouble...

1145
02:09:23.701 --> 02:09:26.417
...of opening your Chocolate Frogs.

1146
02:09:26.613 --> 02:09:29.482
Ron was here? Is he all right?
What about Hermione?

1147
02:09:29.685 --> 02:09:34.354
Fine. They're both just fine.

1148
02:09:34.900 --> 02:09:37.617
- What happened to the Stone?
- Relax, dear boy.

1149
02:09:37.876 --> 02:09:40.876
The Stone has been destroyed.

1150
02:09:41.075 --> 02:09:44.904
My friend Nicholas and I
have had a little chat...

1151
02:09:45.108 --> 02:09:48.937
...and agreed it was best all around.

1152
02:09:49.139 --> 02:09:52.783
But then, Flamel,
he'll die, won't he?

1153
02:09:54.770 --> 02:10:00.007
He has enough Elixir
to set his affairs in order.

1154
02:10:00.210 --> 02:10:03.341
But yes, he will die.

1155
02:10:03.538 --> 02:10:05.839
How is it I got the Stone, sir?

1156
02:10:06.033 --> 02:10:08.521
One minute I was staring
in the mirror and--

1157
02:10:08.721 --> 02:10:12.649
You see, only a person...

1158
02:10:12.881 --> 02:10:16.677
...who wanted to find the Stone,
find it...

1159
02:10:16.881 --> 02:10:21.288
...but not use it,
would be able to get it.

1160
02:10:22.192 --> 02:10:25.575
That is one of my more brilliant ideas.

1161
02:10:25.776 --> 02:10:30.598
And between you and me,
that is saying something.

1162
02:10:31.951 --> 02:10:37.002
Does that mean, with the Stone gone,
that Voldemort can never come back?

1163
02:10:37.198 --> 02:10:39.434
I'm afraid...

1164
02:10:40.783 --> 02:10:44.677
...there are ways
in which he can return.

1165
02:10:45.358 --> 02:10:47.813
Harry, do you know why...

1166
02:10:48.013 --> 02:10:51.842
...Professor Quirrell couldn't bear
to have you touch him?

1167
02:10:52.046 --> 02:10:56.518
It was because of your mother.
She sacrificed herself for you.

1168
02:10:57.004 --> 02:11:00.135
And that kind of act leaves a mark.

1169
02:11:00.333 --> 02:11:03.911
No, this kind of mark cannot be seen.

1170
02:11:04.108 --> 02:11:08.865
- It lives in your very skin.
- What is it?

1171
02:11:09.676 --> 02:11:13.221
Love, Harry. Love.

1172
02:11:20.939 --> 02:11:24.965
Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.

1173
02:11:25.162 --> 02:11:29.635
I was most unfortunate in my youth
to come across a vomit-flavored one.

1174
02:11:29.834 --> 02:11:33.031
And since then,
I've lost my liking for them.

1175
02:11:33.226 --> 02:11:36.488
But I think I could be safe...

1176
02:11:36.681 --> 02:11:38.918
...with a nice toffee.

1177
02:11:42.825 --> 02:11:44.352
Alas!

1178
02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.007
Earwax.

1179
02:12:01.671 --> 02:12:04.704
- All right there, Ron?
- All right. You?

1180
02:12:05.799 --> 02:12:08.352
All right. Hermione?

1181
02:12:09.031 --> 02:12:10.787
Never better.

1182
02:12:25.925 --> 02:12:28.314
Another year gone.

1183
02:12:29.029 --> 02:12:33.404
And now, as I understand it,
the house cup needs awarding.

1184
02:12:33.604 --> 02:12:36.124
And the points stand thus:

1185
02:12:36.325 --> 02:12:41.823
In fourth place,
Gryffindor with 312 points.

1186
02:12:43.748 --> 02:12:49.149
Third place,
Hufflepuff with 352 points.

1187
02:12:54.211 --> 02:12:55.967
In second place...

1188
02:12:56.163 --> 02:13:00.767
...Ravenclaw with 426 points.

1189
02:13:06.241 --> 02:13:07.834
And in first place...

1190
02:13:08.194 --> 02:13:13.376
...with 472 points, Slytherin house.

1191
02:13:18.753 --> 02:13:20.825
Nice one, mate.

1192
02:13:24.544 --> 02:13:28.438
Yes, well done, Slytherin.
Well done.

1193
02:13:28.704 --> 02:13:32.827
However, recent events must
be taken into account.

1194
02:13:33.023 --> 02:13:37.780
And I have a few last-minute points
to award.

1195
02:13:38.399 --> 02:13:43.636
To Miss Hermione Granger,
for the cool use of intellect...

1196
02:13:43.838 --> 02:13:46.555
...while others were in grave peril...

1197
02:13:47.230 --> 02:13:49.369
...50 points.

1198
02:13:50.270 --> 02:13:51.514
Good job.

1199
02:13:58.878 --> 02:14:04.693
Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley,
for the best-played game of chess...

1200
02:14:05.181 --> 02:14:10.232
...that Hogwarts has seen
these many years, 50 points.

1201
02:14:14.651 --> 02:14:16.593
And third...

1202
02:14:17.148 --> 02:14:19.864
...to Mr. Harry Potter...

1203
02:14:20.059 --> 02:14:24.215
...for pure nerve
and outstanding courage...

1204
02:14:24.763 --> 02:14:29.464
...I award Gryffindor house 60 points.

1205
02:14:37.433 --> 02:14:39.255
We're tied with Slytherin!

1206
02:14:39.450 --> 02:14:45.233
Finally, it takes a great deal of bravery
to stand up to your enemies...

1207
02:14:45.433 --> 02:14:49.142
...but a great deal more
to stand up to your friends.

1208
02:14:49.337 --> 02:14:52.184
I award 10 points...

1209
02:14:52.377 --> 02:14:55.443
...to Neville Longbottom.

1210
02:15:08.248 --> 02:15:11.543
Assuming that my calculations
are correct...

1211
02:15:11.734 --> 02:15:16.077
...I believe that a change
of decoration is in order.

1212
02:15:20.886 --> 02:15:24.115
Gryffindor wins the house cup.

1213
02:16:00.659 --> 02:16:03.855
Come on, now.
Hurry up, you'll be late.

1214
02:16:04.050 --> 02:16:08.109
Train's leaving. Go on.
Come on, hurry up.

1215
02:16:13.362 --> 02:16:16.525
- Come on, Harry.
- One minute.

1216
02:16:22.545 --> 02:16:26.090
Thought you were leaving
without saying goodbye, did you?

1217
02:16:29.328 --> 02:16:30.954
This is for you.

1218
02:16:47.022 --> 02:16:49.029
Thanks, Hagrid.

1219
02:16:54.702 --> 02:16:58.924
Go on. On with you. On with you now.
Oh, listen, Harry.

1220
02:16:59.309 --> 02:17:03.586
If that dolt of a cousin of yours,
Dudley, gives you any grief...

1221
02:17:03.790 --> 02:17:06.408
...you could always threaten him...

1222
02:17:06.605 --> 02:17:09.387
...with a nice pair of ears
to go with his tail.

1223
02:17:09.581 --> 02:17:14.436
But we're not allowed to do magic
away from Hogwarts. You know that.

1224
02:17:14.828 --> 02:17:19.018
I do. But your cousin don't, do he?

1225
02:17:24.331 --> 02:17:27.331
Feels strange to be going home,
doesn't it?

1226
02:17:27.531 --> 02:17:29.539
I'm not going home.

1227
02:17:29.739 --> 02:17:31.561
Not really.

1228
02:18:12.886 --> 02:18:16.008
