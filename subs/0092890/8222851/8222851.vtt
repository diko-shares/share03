00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:45.085
Hi, everybody.
This is your cousin Brucie. Whoa!

2
00:01:45.151 --> 00:01:49.189
Our summer romances are in full bloom,
and everybody's in love!

3
00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.358
So cousins, here's a great song
from the Four Seasons.

4
00:01:59.666 --> 00:02:02.469
That was the summer of 1963...

5
00:02:02.502 --> 00:02:06.106
when everybody called me ""Baby""
and it didn't occur to me to mind.

6
00:02:15.014 --> 00:02:17.150
That was before
President Kennedy was shot...

7
00:02:17.217 --> 00:02:19.185
before the Beatles came...

8
00:02:19.285 --> 00:02:21.354
when I couldn't wait
to join the Peace Corps...

9
00:02:21.421 --> 00:02:25.325
and I thought I'd never
find a guy as great as my dad.

10
00:02:34.834 --> 00:02:37.370
That was the summer
we went to Kellerman's.

11
00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:59.592
Ping-Pong in the west arcade,
softball in the east diamond.

12
00:02:59.692 --> 00:03:01.928
All you Sandy Koufaxes,
get out there!

13
00:03:02.028 --> 00:03:04.464
Complimentary dance lessons
in the gazebo.

14
00:03:04.531 --> 00:03:07.167
Oh, my God.
Look at that!

15
00:03:07.233 --> 00:03:11.371
Mom, I should've brought the coral
shoes. You said I was taking too much.

16
00:03:11.438 --> 00:03:14.074
Well, sweetheart,
you brought ten pairs.

17
00:03:14.174 --> 00:03:16.643
But the coral shoes
matched that dress.

18
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.378
This is not a tragedy.

19
00:03:18.445 --> 00:03:22.916
A tragedy is three men trapped in a mine
or police dogs used in Birmingham.

20
00:03:22.982 --> 00:03:25.185
Monks burning themselves
in protest.

21
00:03:25.251 --> 00:03:26.653
Butt out, Baby.

22
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.457
Okay, we got horseshoes
on the south lawn in 15 minutes!

23
00:03:30.557 --> 00:03:33.493
We've got splish-splash
the water class down by the lake.

24
00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.197
We have the still life art class.
We got volleyball and croquet.

25
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.799
And for you older folks,
we got sacks!

26
00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.569
Doc!

27
00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:43.903
Doc!

28
00:03:44.637 --> 00:03:45.839
Max!

29
00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:50.677
Doc, after all these years
I finally got you up on my mountain.

30
00:03:51.578 --> 00:03:53.012
How's the blood pressure?

31
00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:55.014
I want you girls to know...

32
00:03:55.081 --> 00:03:58.485
if it were not for this man,
I'd be standing here dead.

33
00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.755
- Billy, get the bags.
- Right away, Doc.

34
00:04:01.821 --> 00:04:05.024
I kept the best cabin
for you and your beautiful girls.

35
00:04:08.795 --> 00:04:10.930
Hey, thanks a lot.

36
00:04:10.997 --> 00:04:12.699
You want a job here?

37
00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:15.935
There's a merengue class in
the gazebo in the next few minutes.

38
00:04:16.002 --> 00:04:18.705
The greatest teacher.
Used to be a Rockette.

39
00:04:18.805 --> 00:04:22.776
It's his first real vacation
in six years, Max. Take it easy.

40
00:04:22.842 --> 00:04:25.712
Three weeks here,
it'll feel like a year.

41
00:04:25.812 --> 00:04:29.349
One, two, three, four! Stomp
those grapes and stomp some more!

42
00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.586
One, two, three, four!
Listen to the music!

43
00:04:33.653 --> 00:04:35.055
Sorry.

44
00:04:35.155 --> 00:04:36.890
Move your caboose
and shake it loose!

45
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.794
One, two, three, four!
Start the train!

46
00:04:45.298 --> 00:04:48.068
Come on, men!
Follow me into a round robin!

47
00:04:49.135 --> 00:04:51.371
Ladies, the inner circle!

48
00:05:01.448 --> 00:05:03.016
Come on, ladies!

49
00:05:03.083 --> 00:05:07.520
God wouldn't have given you maracas
if he didn't want you to shake them!

50
00:05:11.858 --> 00:05:14.627
Okay now, ladies,
when I say ""stop""...

51
00:05:14.694 --> 00:05:17.697
you're gonna find
the man of your dreams.

52
00:05:18.765 --> 00:05:20.033
Stop!

53
00:05:21.735 --> 00:05:25.839
Remember, he's the boss on
the dance floor, if nowhere else.

54
00:05:34.714 --> 00:05:37.951
Mom, Dad, I'm going up
to the main house to look around.

55
00:06:15.588 --> 00:06:18.291
There are two kinds of help here.

56
00:06:18.391 --> 00:06:20.560
You waiters are
all college guys...

57
00:06:20.627 --> 00:06:24.531
and I went to Harvard
and Yale to hire you.

58
00:06:24.597 --> 00:06:27.567
And why did I do that? Why?

59
00:06:28.968 --> 00:06:31.771
I shouldn't have to remind you.
This is a family place.

60
00:06:31.838 --> 00:06:35.642
That means you keep your fingers out
of the water, hair out of the soup...

61
00:06:35.742 --> 00:06:37.911
and show the goddamn
daughters a good time.

62
00:06:38.745 --> 00:06:40.146
All the daughters.

63
00:06:41.648 --> 00:06:43.817
Even the dogs.

64
00:06:43.917 --> 00:06:46.653
Schlepp 'em out to the terrace,
show 'em the stars.

65
00:06:46.753 --> 00:06:49.022
- Romance 'em any way you want.
- Got that, guys?

66
00:06:49.122 --> 00:06:51.091
Hey, hold it!
Hold it.

67
00:06:52.992 --> 00:06:56.629
Well, if it isn't
the entertainment staff.

68
00:06:56.663 --> 00:06:58.998
Listen, wise ass,
you got your own rules.

69
00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:01.267
Dance with the daughters.
Teach 'em the mambo...

70
00:07:01.334 --> 00:07:03.970
the cha-cha,
anything they pay for.

71
00:07:04.037 --> 00:07:05.638
That's it.

72
00:07:05.739 --> 00:07:07.907
That's where it ends.

73
00:07:07.974 --> 00:07:11.644
No funny business, no conversations,
and keep you hands off!

74
00:07:14.547 --> 00:07:18.218
It's the same at all these places. Some
ass in the woods, but no conversation.

75
00:07:18.318 --> 00:07:20.220
Watch it, Rodriguez.

76
00:07:22.455 --> 00:07:26.359
Can you keep that straight, Johnny?
What you can't lay your hands on?

77
00:07:30.797 --> 00:07:34.567
Just put your pickle on everybody's
plate, and leave the hard stuff to me.

78
00:07:41.241 --> 00:07:43.810
Sit down and I'll
get you some wine.

79
00:07:44.677 --> 00:07:46.212
Thank you, Max.

80
00:07:49.516 --> 00:07:51.251
This is Dr. and Mrs. Houseman.

81
00:07:51.351 --> 00:07:55.388
Baby, Lisa, this is your waiter,
Robbie Gould.

82
00:07:55.488 --> 00:07:58.158
Yale medical school.

83
00:07:58.224 --> 00:08:02.162
These people are my special guests.
Give them anything they want.

84
00:08:02.195 --> 00:08:04.164
- Enjoy.
- Thanks, Max.

85
00:08:08.868 --> 00:08:13.073
Look at all this leftover food. Are
there still starving children in Europe?

86
00:08:13.173 --> 00:08:15.875
- Try Southeast Asia, Ma.
- Right.

87
00:08:15.975 --> 00:08:18.545
Robbie, Baby wants to send
her leftover pot roast...

88
00:08:18.611 --> 00:08:21.748
to Southeast Asia,
so anything you don't finish, wrap up.

89
00:08:22.682 --> 00:08:25.285
Max, our Baby's gonna
change the world.

90
00:08:25.385 --> 00:08:28.722
- And what are you gonna do, Missy?
- Lisa's gonna decorate it.

91
00:08:28.822 --> 00:08:30.890
She already does.

92
00:08:32.892 --> 00:08:36.830
Doc, I want you to meet someone.
My grandson Neil.

93
00:08:36.896 --> 00:08:39.299
Goes to the Cornell School
of Hotel Management.

94
00:08:39.399 --> 00:08:41.634
Baby's starting
Mount Holyoke in the fall.

95
00:08:42.635 --> 00:08:44.371
Oh, great.

96
00:08:53.046 --> 00:08:54.614
Are you going to major in English?

97
00:08:54.714 --> 00:08:58.151
No. Economics of
underdeveloped countries.

98
00:08:58.218 --> 00:09:01.621
- I'm going into the Peace Corps.
- After the final show...

99
00:09:01.721 --> 00:09:05.492
I'm going to Mississippi with
a couple of busboys, freedom ride.

100
00:09:24.911 --> 00:09:27.480
This is our own Tito Suarez.

101
00:10:14.728 --> 00:10:17.163
Mambo!
Yeah! Come on!

102
00:10:24.404 --> 00:10:26.539
Who's that?

103
00:10:26.573 --> 00:10:29.042
Oh, them.
They're the dance people.

104
00:10:29.109 --> 00:10:32.112
They're here to keep
the guests happy.

105
00:10:54.768 --> 00:10:58.905
They shouldn't show off with each other.
That's not gonna sell lessons.

106
00:12:15.815 --> 00:12:18.385
- Hi, kids. Having fun?
- Yeah.

107
00:12:18.451 --> 00:12:22.322
Actually, I've gotta excuse myself.
I'm in charge of the games tonight.

108
00:12:22.389 --> 00:12:25.125
Would you like to help me
get things started?

109
00:12:25.158 --> 00:12:26.860
Sure she would.

110
00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:38.304
This'll only hurt for a minute.
You've got Blue Cross, right?

111
00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.183
Was that good for you?

112
00:12:50.216 --> 00:12:53.853
And for being such a good sport,
here you go!

113
00:12:59.659 --> 00:13:02.328
I finally met a girl
exactly like my mother.

114
00:13:02.429 --> 00:13:05.498
Dresses like her, acts like her.
So I brought her home.

115
00:13:05.532 --> 00:13:07.500
My father doesn't like her!

116
00:13:09.235 --> 00:13:11.071
Go figure.

117
00:14:00.053 --> 00:14:02.689
- Hi.
- How'd you get here?

118
00:14:02.722 --> 00:14:04.357
- I was taking a walk.
- Go back.

119
00:14:04.391 --> 00:14:06.393
Let me help you.
What's up there?

120
00:14:06.493 --> 00:14:08.395
No guests allowed.
House rules.

121
00:14:08.495 --> 00:14:12.932
Why don't you go back to the playhouse?
I saw you dancing with little boss man.

122
00:14:17.771 --> 00:14:19.739
Can you keep a secret?

123
00:14:22.042 --> 00:14:24.577
Your parents would kill you.

124
00:14:24.677 --> 00:14:26.579
Max would kill me.

125
00:15:19.666 --> 00:15:22.001
Where'd they learn to do that?

126
00:15:22.102 --> 00:15:23.937
Where?

127
00:15:24.003 --> 00:15:27.006
I don't know. Kids are doing it
in their basements back home.

128
00:15:28.308 --> 00:15:30.276
Wanna try it?

129
00:15:31.111 --> 00:15:33.046
Come on, Baby.

130
00:16:10.016 --> 00:16:13.153
Can you imagine dancing like this
on the main floor...

131
00:16:13.219 --> 00:16:15.655
home of the family fox-trot?

132
00:16:15.688 --> 00:16:18.224
Max would close
the place down first.

133
00:16:50.356 --> 00:16:52.625
That's my cousin, Johnny Castle.

134
00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:55.762
He got me the job here.

135
00:17:14.781 --> 00:17:17.283
- They look great together.
- Yeah.

136
00:17:17.317 --> 00:17:19.786
You'd think they were
a couple, wouldn't you?

137
00:17:19.853 --> 00:17:23.623
- Aren't they?
- No, not since we were kids.

138
00:18:03.329 --> 00:18:03.363
Do you love me?

139
00:18:03.363 --> 00:18:05.265
Do you love me?

140
00:18:24.984 --> 00:18:27.854
Yo, cousin, what's she doing here?

141
00:18:28.521 --> 00:18:31.191
She came with me.
She's with me.

142
00:18:31.257 --> 00:18:33.093
I carried a watermelon.

143
00:18:39.099 --> 00:18:41.167
I carried a watermelon?

144
00:19:14.901 --> 00:19:17.070
Bend your knees. Down.

145
00:19:21.741 --> 00:19:23.309
Watch. Watch my eyes.

146
00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:25.879
Good.

147
00:19:30.016 --> 00:19:31.551
That's better.

148
00:19:36.423 --> 00:19:38.391
Good. Now roll this way.

149
00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:41.895
Now watch.

150
00:19:51.905 --> 00:19:53.573
Look.

151
00:20:04.384 --> 00:20:06.119
Love man!

152
00:20:41.788 --> 00:20:45.258
Ladies, join our hair-raising
wig show.

153
00:20:45.325 --> 00:20:47.293
Try your Sandra Dee,
Jackie Kennedy...

154
00:20:47.394 --> 00:20:50.096
or Elizabeth Taylor-Cleopatra wig.

155
00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:53.633
- I'll knock with three.
- Look at that cute fella.

156
00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:55.969
Look at these hands.
They're golden hands.

157
00:20:58.671 --> 00:21:01.641
My God, it's Cleopatra!
I feel like such an ""asp"".

158
00:21:01.708 --> 00:21:03.977
You look ten years younger.

159
00:21:04.044 --> 00:21:06.980
At 10:.15, by the pool,
we have calisthenics.

160
00:21:07.013 --> 00:21:10.316
Then on the west porch, we have
a symposium by Rabbi Maurice Sherman...

161
00:21:10.417 --> 00:21:13.319
on the psychology
of insult comedians.

162
00:21:15.055 --> 00:21:18.058
So I say, ""Ask not what your waiter
can do for you...

163
00:21:18.158 --> 00:21:20.627
but what you can do
for your waiter.""

164
00:21:20.693 --> 00:21:23.663
If tips keep up, I'll have enough
for my Alfa Romeo.

165
00:21:25.065 --> 00:21:26.900
That's my favorite car.

166
00:21:29.069 --> 00:21:31.337
Ladies, you look very lovely.

167
00:21:32.439 --> 00:21:36.309
Baby, would you cover for me tonight?
Tell Mom and Dad I went to lie down.

168
00:21:36.342 --> 00:21:38.144
Where are you going?

169
00:21:38.211 --> 00:21:42.182
To the golf course. There's
a pretty view from the first tee.

170
00:21:45.385 --> 00:21:47.721
Good. Thanks.

171
00:21:54.828 --> 00:21:58.031
So you were really a Rockette?

172
00:21:58.098 --> 00:22:00.166
I think you're a wonderful dancer.

173
00:22:00.233 --> 00:22:03.670
Yeah? Well, my mother kicked me out
when I was 16.

174
00:22:03.703 --> 00:22:07.374
I've been dancing ever since. It's the
only thing I ever wanted to do anyway.

175
00:22:08.742 --> 00:22:10.677
I envy you.

176
00:22:34.534 --> 00:22:38.571
- Aren't you dancing, Doc?
- We're waiting for a waltz.

177
00:22:40.106 --> 00:22:44.144
Hi, Max. Aren't my dance lessons
starting to pay off?

178
00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:47.714
You look great, Vivian!
Terrific!

179
00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:54.888
That's Vivian Pressman,
one of the bungalow bunnies.

180
00:22:56.556 --> 00:22:59.526
That's what we call the women
who stay here all week.

181
00:23:00.326 --> 00:23:03.263
The husbands only come up
on weekends.

182
00:23:03.329 --> 00:23:06.699
Moe Pressman's a big card player.
He'll join our game.

183
00:23:08.301 --> 00:23:11.104
- Moe coming up on Friday?
- Friday.

184
00:23:12.072 --> 00:23:14.441
He's away a lot. I know.

185
00:23:15.742 --> 00:23:17.744
It's a hardship.

186
00:23:23.883 --> 00:23:27.454
Where's Penny?
Everybody's been asking for her.

187
00:23:28.922 --> 00:23:32.892
What do you mean, where's Penny?
She's taking a break.

188
00:23:32.926 --> 00:23:35.462
As long as it's not
an all-night break.

189
00:23:39.599 --> 00:23:42.135
Come on, doll. Let's take a walk.

190
00:23:51.544 --> 00:23:54.981
I love to watch your hair
blowing in the breeze.

191
00:23:58.551 --> 00:24:00.820
Maybe my parents
are looking for me.

192
00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.655
Baby, don't worry.

193
00:24:02.756 --> 00:24:06.493
If they think you're with me, they'll be
the happiest parents at Kellerman's.

194
00:24:08.695 --> 00:24:10.630
I have to say it.

195
00:24:10.697 --> 00:24:13.700
- I'm known as the catch of the county.
- I'm sure you are.

196
00:24:13.767 --> 00:24:16.870
Last week I took a girl away
from Jamie, the lifeguard.

197
00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:22.142
And he said to her,
""What does he have that I don't have?""

198
00:24:22.208 --> 00:24:25.512
And she said, ""Two hotels.""

199
00:24:27.547 --> 00:24:28.681
Robbie.

200
00:24:29.582 --> 00:24:31.584
I don't hear an apology.

201
00:24:31.684 --> 00:24:36.890
Go back to Mommy and Daddy and listen.
Maybe you'll hear one in your dreams.

202
00:24:39.059 --> 00:24:41.861
I'm sorry you had
to see that, Baby.

203
00:24:42.796 --> 00:24:45.231
Sometimes in this world...

204
00:24:45.331 --> 00:24:47.867
you see things
you don't wanna see.

205
00:24:52.439 --> 00:24:54.374
You hungry?

206
00:24:55.241 --> 00:24:56.876
Come on.

207
00:25:02.916 --> 00:25:06.886
So, Baby, what do you want?
You can have anything you want.

208
00:25:08.088 --> 00:25:10.690
A brownie, some milk...

209
00:25:10.757 --> 00:25:14.260
Ieftover rice pudding,
beets...

210
00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:16.062
cabbage roll...

211
00:25:20.266 --> 00:25:22.602
fruit salad, sweet gherkins?

212
00:25:22.635 --> 00:25:26.740
Neil, look, I'm sorry.
I better go check on Lisa.

213
00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:28.575
Yeah.

214
00:25:58.304 --> 00:26:01.307
- Why's she here?
- In case Neil comes back.

215
00:26:01.341 --> 00:26:03.443
Penny just doesn't think.

216
00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:06.479
She wouldn't do anything
stupid, would she?

217
00:26:07.313 --> 00:26:11.051
So, what's wrong?
What's the matter with her?

218
00:26:12.085 --> 00:26:14.587
- She's knocked up, Baby.
- Billy!

219
00:26:16.289 --> 00:26:20.260
- What's he gonna do about it?
- ""What's he gonna do about it?""

220
00:26:20.994 --> 00:26:22.595
It's mine, right?

221
00:26:22.662 --> 00:26:25.331
- Right away you think it's mine.
- But I thought...

222
00:26:42.982 --> 00:26:45.652
It's okay. Johnny's here.

223
00:26:50.156 --> 00:26:52.659
I'm never gonna let anything
happen to you.

224
00:26:56.896 --> 00:26:58.832
We got to go.

225
00:27:00.967 --> 00:27:03.336
Just hold on. Just hold on.

226
00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:05.972
Good girl. Good girl.

227
00:27:10.577 --> 00:27:13.580
What do you think you're doing?
You're in trouble, you talk to me.

228
00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:16.116
I'll take care of it.

229
00:27:16.182 --> 00:27:19.686
You should've come to me
in the first place.

230
00:27:19.753 --> 00:27:23.156
Forget it, Johnny. I'm not taking
what's left of your salary.

231
00:27:23.189 --> 00:27:27.160
- Penny, that's my business.
- Besides, it wouldn't be enough.

232
00:27:37.003 --> 00:27:39.406
Oh, God, it's hopeless!

233
00:27:39.506 --> 00:27:41.674
Don't say that.

234
00:27:41.708 --> 00:27:44.711
There's gotta be a way
to work it out.

235
00:27:47.313 --> 00:27:50.683
Baby? Is that your name?

236
00:27:51.584 --> 00:27:53.353
You know what, Baby?

237
00:27:54.387 --> 00:27:56.856
You don't know shit
about my problems.

238
00:27:58.058 --> 00:28:00.026
I told her.

239
00:28:00.093 --> 00:28:05.565
Jesus! She's gonna tell her management
boyfriend and then we'll all get fired.

240
00:28:05.632 --> 00:28:09.936
Why not skywrite it? ""Penny got
knocked up by Robbie, the creep.""

241
00:28:10.036 --> 00:28:12.639
- Look--
- No, Baby.

242
00:28:13.873 --> 00:28:16.710
One of the counselors
knows a doctor, a real M.D....

243
00:28:16.776 --> 00:28:19.779
just traveling through New Paltz
one day next week.

244
00:28:19.879 --> 00:28:22.649
We can get an appointment,
but it costs $250.

245
00:28:22.716 --> 00:28:26.352
But if it's Robbie, there's no problem.
I know he has the money.

246
00:28:26.419 --> 00:28:28.888
- I'm sure if you tell him--
- He knows.

247
00:28:36.429 --> 00:28:40.500
Go back to your playpen, Baby.

248
00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:50.477
- Why should you tell me what's right?
- You can't just leave her.

249
00:28:50.477 --> 00:28:54.080
- Why should you tell me what's right?
- You can't just leave her.

250
00:28:54.147 --> 00:28:57.650
I didn't blow a summer hauling bagels
just to bail out some chick...

251
00:28:57.751 --> 00:29:00.019
who probably slept
with every guy here.

252
00:29:00.086 --> 00:29:02.088
A little precision, please.

253
00:29:04.991 --> 00:29:08.094
Some people count
and some people don't.

254
00:29:09.963 --> 00:29:10.930
Read it.

255
00:29:13.266 --> 00:29:16.669
I think you'll enjoy it. But return it.
I have notes in there.

256
00:29:19.005 --> 00:29:22.208
You make me sick.
Stay away from me.

257
00:29:22.308 --> 00:29:26.579
Stay away from my sister
or I'll have you fired.

258
00:29:40.894 --> 00:29:42.862
What am I doing wrong?

259
00:29:42.962 --> 00:29:45.865
You're lining it up
a little wrong, Marge.

260
00:29:47.534 --> 00:29:50.236
If your mother ever leaves me,
it'll be for Arnold Palmer.

261
00:29:50.336 --> 00:29:53.139
- Daddy, someone's in trouble.
- Besides your mother?

262
00:29:53.206 --> 00:29:55.308
You're overcorrecting, Marge.

263
00:29:56.376 --> 00:29:59.813
You always told me if someone
was in trouble, I should help.

264
00:29:59.879 --> 00:30:01.815
Could you lend me $250?

265
00:30:03.316 --> 00:30:05.552
Are you all right?
Are you in trouble?

266
00:30:05.618 --> 00:30:08.621
No, it's not me.
Could you loan it to me?

267
00:30:08.655 --> 00:30:11.257
That's a lot of money.
What's it for?

268
00:30:11.357 --> 00:30:13.460
Baby, stand up straight.

269
00:30:14.327 --> 00:30:16.396
I can't tell you.

270
00:30:16.496 --> 00:30:19.733
It's hard for me to say that to you,
but I can't.

271
00:30:19.766 --> 00:30:22.569
You always said you could
tell me anything.

272
00:30:22.635 --> 00:30:25.004
I can't tell you this.

273
00:30:27.107 --> 00:30:29.509
It's not illegal, is it?

274
00:30:31.778 --> 00:30:33.847
No, Daddy.

275
00:30:35.415 --> 00:30:39.252
That was a stupid thing to ask.
Forgive me.

276
00:30:40.787 --> 00:30:42.856
I'll have it for you before dinner.

277
00:30:42.922 --> 00:30:45.525
- Is everything all right?
- Fine.

278
00:30:45.592 --> 00:30:47.527
Thanks, Daddy.

279
00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:49.589
Here's the money.

280
00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:55.328
- You mean Robbie?
- No. You were right about him?

281
00:31:55.428 --> 00:31:58.932
- Then where'd you get it?
- You said you needed it.

282
00:31:59.833 --> 00:32:03.536
- Is this kid for real?
- Takes a real saint to ask Daddy.

283
00:32:08.842 --> 00:32:11.211
Thanks, Baby, but I can't use it.

284
00:32:15.548 --> 00:32:19.452
What? What's the matter with you?
You should take the money.

285
00:32:19.519 --> 00:32:22.922
I can only get her an appointment
for Thursday.

286
00:32:22.989 --> 00:32:25.291
They do their act
at the Sheldrake Thursday.

287
00:32:25.358 --> 00:32:29.195
If they cancel, they lose this
season's salary and next year's gig.

288
00:32:29.229 --> 00:32:30.830
What's the Sheldrake?

289
00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:34.934
It's another hotel
where they do their mambo act.

290
00:32:36.036 --> 00:32:37.670
Can't someone else fill in?

291
00:32:39.172 --> 00:32:41.641
No, ""Miss Fix-it.""
Somebody else can't.

292
00:32:41.708 --> 00:32:44.811
Maria has to work all day.
She can't learn the routines.

293
00:32:44.878 --> 00:32:47.981
And Janet has to fill in for Penny.
Everybody works here.

294
00:32:48.782 --> 00:32:51.651
You wanna do it?
Take time out from ""Simon Says""?

295
00:32:54.154 --> 00:32:56.056
It's not a bad idea.

296
00:32:57.057 --> 00:32:58.491
It was a 5oke.

297
00:32:59.559 --> 00:33:03.029
- She can move.
- It's the dumbest idea I ever heard of.

298
00:33:03.096 --> 00:33:05.532
- I can't even do the merengue.
- See?

299
00:33:05.598 --> 00:33:08.168
You're a strong partner.
You can lead anybody.

300
00:33:08.234 --> 00:33:11.971
She can't even do the merengue.
She cannot do it.

301
00:33:17.343 --> 00:33:19.612
- No!
- Oh, sorry. Sorry.

302
00:33:19.713 --> 00:33:22.215
You don't step on the one.

303
00:33:22.282 --> 00:33:26.052
You gotta start on the two.
Find the two. Understand?

304
00:33:26.119 --> 00:33:30.623
-I never did any of these dances before.
-It's one, two, three, four.

305
00:33:30.724 --> 00:33:34.427
When the music starts, you don't
dance until the two. Got it?

306
00:33:34.527 --> 00:33:36.529
Relax, relax.

307
00:33:36.596 --> 00:33:38.364
Breathe.

308
00:33:39.065 --> 00:33:40.700
Frame.

309
00:33:40.734 --> 00:33:42.369
Nope.

310
00:33:49.075 --> 00:33:50.377
Again.

311
00:33:50.410 --> 00:33:52.412
Ow.

312
00:33:52.479 --> 00:33:55.548
Two, three, four.
Two, three, four.

313
00:33:55.582 --> 00:33:58.251
Don't lean back. Lifting up.

314
00:33:58.318 --> 00:34:00.720
Two, three, four.
Shoulders down.

315
00:34:07.494 --> 00:34:10.029
Again. Concentrate. And...

316
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:52.672
Don't put your heel down.

317
00:34:53.473 --> 00:34:55.542
- Don't put your heel down.
- I didn't--

318
00:34:55.642 --> 00:34:58.078
Stay on the toe.
Just listen to me.

319
00:34:58.111 --> 00:35:00.447
The steps aren't enough.

320
00:35:00.513 --> 00:35:02.549
Feel the music.

321
00:35:24.971 --> 00:35:25.004
It's not on the one.
It's not the mambo.

322
00:35:25.004 --> 00:35:27.640
It's not on the one.
It's not the mambo.

323
00:35:27.707 --> 00:35:30.744
It's a feeling, a heartbeat.

324
00:35:37.751 --> 00:35:39.919
Don't try so hard.

325
00:35:44.324 --> 00:35:46.292
Close your eyes.

326
00:35:52.599 --> 00:35:55.502
Two, three, four.
Two, three, four.

327
00:35:58.571 --> 00:36:00.140
Breathe.

328
00:36:12.752 --> 00:36:15.755
Head up.
Lock your frame. Lock it.

329
00:36:15.855 --> 00:36:17.757
Look, spaghetti arm.

330
00:36:18.625 --> 00:36:21.895
This is my dance space.
This is your dance space.

331
00:36:21.961 --> 00:36:25.432
I don't go into yours. You don't
go into mine. You gotta hold the frame.

332
00:36:25.532 --> 00:36:27.333
Again.

333
00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:28.968
Frame.

334
00:39:23.443 --> 00:39:23.543
Back. Easy.

335
00:39:23.543 --> 00:39:25.545
Back. Easy.

336
00:39:27.147 --> 00:39:30.917
And turn, turn. Down.
And lift. You'll learn that later.

337
00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:32.886
And come on.

338
00:39:32.952 --> 00:39:34.921
Down. Twist.

339
00:39:34.954 --> 00:39:36.589
And the bow.

340
00:39:36.689 --> 00:39:39.626
- Sorry. Sorry.
- You trying to kill me?

341
00:39:39.726 --> 00:39:43.963
You gotta concentrate!
Is that your idea of fun?

342
00:39:44.064 --> 00:39:46.299
As a matter of fact it is.

343
00:39:46.399 --> 00:39:50.270
We do the show in two days, you won't
show me lifts, I'm not sure of turns.

344
00:39:50.303 --> 00:39:53.940
I'm doing all this to save your ass,
but I'd rather drop you on it!

345
00:39:55.942 --> 00:39:57.277
Let's leave.

346
00:40:03.983 --> 00:40:05.719
Shit!

347
00:40:07.954 --> 00:40:10.356
I locked the keys in the car!

348
00:40:32.979 --> 00:40:35.215
You're getting wet, right?

349
00:40:47.827 --> 00:40:49.829
- You're wild.
- What?

350
00:40:49.863 --> 00:40:52.065
You're wild!

351
00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:25.565
Now, the most important thing
to remember in lifts is balance.

352
00:41:26.499 --> 00:41:28.334
Whoa! Whoa!

353
00:41:34.441 --> 00:41:36.076
I got it now.

354
00:41:36.176 --> 00:41:39.079
So where'd you learn
to be a dancer?

355
00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:44.184
Well, this guy came into
this luncheonette one day and...

356
00:41:44.250 --> 00:41:47.454
we were all sitting around
doing nothing.

357
00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:51.091
And he said that Arthur Murray
was giving a test for instructors.

358
00:41:51.191 --> 00:41:53.460
So, if you passed...

359
00:41:57.697 --> 00:42:02.469
they teach you different dances, show
you how to break them down, teach them.

360
00:42:06.139 --> 00:42:07.474
What?

361
00:42:16.316 --> 00:42:18.084
Good.

362
00:42:18.885 --> 00:42:23.089
Don't look down.
Look here. Good.

363
00:42:23.156 --> 00:42:24.858
And...

364
00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:10.003
Now, bend your knees
and go up. Go, go.

365
00:43:11.971 --> 00:43:16.076
Good try. Now, you'll hurt me
if you don't trust me, all right?

366
00:43:16.142 --> 00:43:18.078
Now, go, go. Go.

367
00:43:20.547 --> 00:43:22.882
Good. Now, I'm gonna go up.

368
00:43:30.123 --> 00:43:33.393
You know, the best place
to practice lifts is in the water.

369
00:43:33.493 --> 00:43:35.995
Just bend your knees.
And... go.

370
00:43:36.896 --> 00:43:38.465
Good.

371
00:43:38.531 --> 00:43:40.133
Good. Good.

372
00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:42.302
Now hold the position. Hold it.

373
00:43:42.369 --> 00:43:44.537
Good. Don't break! Don't break!

374
00:43:57.917 --> 00:43:59.853
Let's do it again.

375
00:44:02.655 --> 00:44:06.493
All right. One, two, three.

376
00:44:07.761 --> 00:44:09.562
Oh, sorry.

377
00:44:10.764 --> 00:44:13.066
Good. Keep-- No, don't.

378
00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:29.582
It's not too bad.

379
00:44:32.952 --> 00:44:35.922
- One more time.
- Okay. Over my head. Go.

380
00:44:37.624 --> 00:44:37.724
I can't believe it's tonight.

381
00:44:37.724 --> 00:44:40.026
I can't believe it's tonight.

382
00:44:40.093 --> 00:44:43.263
Sheldrake's 20 minutes away.
We'll change in the car.

383
00:44:45.565 --> 00:44:49.035
Mrs. Schumacher.
Hey, wait, we'll help you.

384
00:44:51.071 --> 00:44:53.773
Such junk. Such junk.

385
00:44:55.341 --> 00:45:00.280
Benny Bernstein's Dancing School,
that's where I went.

386
00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:03.083
George Burns was a teacher.

387
00:45:04.451 --> 00:45:06.886
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

388
00:45:11.624 --> 00:45:11.658
I'll just keep my shoulders down,
my head up...

389
00:45:11.658 --> 00:45:14.427
I'll just keep my shoulders down,
my head up...

390
00:45:14.494 --> 00:45:17.630
my frame locked,
stay on my toes...

391
00:45:17.731 --> 00:45:19.766
What if I forget the steps?

392
00:45:19.799 --> 00:45:23.370
Pull up, watch the frame.
And remember, let him lead you.

393
00:45:23.436 --> 00:45:27.774
I'm afraid I'm gonna forget to spike,
get dizzy and fall on my face.

394
00:45:27.807 --> 00:45:32.746
No. Don't look at my feet,
keep my head up, my eyes open...

395
00:45:32.812 --> 00:45:36.783
tension in my arms, my frame locked,
seat pulled up...

396
00:45:36.850 --> 00:45:38.818
Thanks, Baby.

397
00:45:41.321 --> 00:45:44.557
I just want you to know
that I don't sleep around...

398
00:45:44.624 --> 00:45:47.660
whatever Robbie might have told you.

399
00:45:47.761 --> 00:45:50.497
And I thought that he loved me.

400
00:45:51.398 --> 00:45:53.666
I thought it was something special.

401
00:45:54.834 --> 00:45:57.670
Anyway, I just wanted you
to know that.

402
00:46:01.708 --> 00:46:04.010
So, how does it look?

403
00:46:11.785 --> 00:46:13.353
I'm scared.

404
00:46:15.822 --> 00:46:18.191
I'm so scared, Baby.

405
00:46:19.159 --> 00:46:21.127
Don't worry.

406
00:46:21.728 --> 00:46:23.663
You'll be fine.

407
00:46:28.802 --> 00:46:32.806
Bingo! Bingo! Bingo! That's right.
It's Thursday night at Kellerman's.

408
00:46:32.839 --> 00:46:34.808
That's bingo night.

409
00:46:34.841 --> 00:46:38.611
- Hey, how about a dance later?
- Could be. Who knows?

410
00:46:38.678 --> 00:46:42.048
- Lisa, you have to do something for me.
- I don't have to.

411
00:46:42.148 --> 00:46:46.486
Just tell Mom and Dad I have a headache
and I'm in bed, okay?

412
00:46:49.022 --> 00:46:50.557
Bye.

413
00:46:52.225 --> 00:46:52.325
The Sheldrake Hotel is proud to present
Johnny Castle and partner...

414
00:46:52.325 --> 00:46:56.696
The Sheldrake Hotel is proud to present
Johnny Castle and partner...

415
00:46:56.763 --> 00:46:59.065
in ""Mambo Magic.""

416
00:47:02.769 --> 00:47:04.237
Relax.

417
00:47:36.936 --> 00:47:39.139
Now spot a lead.

418
00:48:08.168 --> 00:48:10.103
Wrong way!

419
00:48:18.344 --> 00:48:20.280
Over here.

420
00:48:27.887 --> 00:48:29.656
Ready for the lift?

421
00:48:32.092 --> 00:48:33.426
Come on.

422
00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:42.268
Keep going. Keep going.

423
00:49:25.412 --> 00:49:28.882
...because wherever you are now,
I want you to look at the sky.

424
00:49:28.982 --> 00:49:33.219
Look at those stars.
What a show. Here are The Drifters.

425
00:49:34.254 --> 00:49:36.222
You did good. You worked hard.

426
00:49:36.256 --> 00:49:38.892
I saw that old couple from Kellerman's
and I thought that was it.

427
00:49:38.958 --> 00:49:40.960
Me too. Me too.

428
00:49:42.562 --> 00:49:45.265
You know, by the second turn
you really had it.

429
00:49:45.365 --> 00:49:48.902
- But I didn't do the lift.
- You did real good.

430
00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:52.599
Thanks.

431
00:50:55.869 --> 00:50:57.437
Johnny!

432
00:50:57.504 --> 00:51:00.306
Come on. It's Penny.

433
00:51:01.941 --> 00:51:04.511
- She wouldn't go until you returned.
- Did you call an ambulance?

434
00:51:04.577 --> 00:51:07.280
She said the hospital would call
the police. She made me promise.

435
00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:10.183
He didn't use no ether, nothing.

436
00:51:10.283 --> 00:51:15.388
- I thought you said he was a real M.D.?
- He had a dirty knife and a table.

437
00:51:15.488 --> 00:51:17.757
I could hear her screaming
in the hallway.

438
00:51:17.857 --> 00:51:20.760
I swear to God,
I tried to get in.

439
00:51:22.896 --> 00:51:25.698
It's all right. Johnny's here.

440
00:51:39.312 --> 00:51:41.414
What? What is it, Baby?

441
00:51:42.615 --> 00:51:44.784
- Is it Lisa?
- No.

442
00:52:00.266 --> 00:52:03.803
Excuse me. Excuse me!
Everybody clear out, please.

443
00:52:14.414 --> 00:52:17.617
Yes, I know that hurts.
We're gonna take care of that.

444
00:52:21.187 --> 00:52:24.958
- Who's responsible for this girl?
- I am.

445
00:52:25.058 --> 00:52:27.394
Please, is she--

446
00:52:45.111 --> 00:52:47.080
Doc, thanks a lot.

447
00:52:47.113 --> 00:52:50.417
I don't know how to thank you.

448
00:53:00.427 --> 00:53:03.930
- Was that what my money paid for?
- I'm sorry. I never meant to lie.

449
00:53:03.997 --> 00:53:07.600
You're not the person I thought
you were. I'm not sure who you are.

450
00:53:07.667 --> 00:53:10.036
I don't want you to have anything
to do with those people.

451
00:53:10.136 --> 00:53:14.174
Nothing! You're to have nothing
to do with them ever again!

452
00:53:14.274 --> 00:53:17.844
I won't tell your mother about this.
Right now I'm going to bed.

453
00:53:17.944 --> 00:53:21.281
And take that stuff off your face
before your mother sees you!

454
00:53:25.518 --> 00:53:28.121
Is everything all right, Jake?

455
00:53:28.188 --> 00:53:31.624
It's all right, Marjorie.
Go back to sleep.

456
00:53:51.378 --> 00:53:53.313
Can I come in?

457
00:54:05.625 --> 00:54:09.462
I got a-- I guess it's not a great room.
You probably got a great room.

458
00:54:09.529 --> 00:54:11.998
No. It's a great room!

459
00:54:23.009 --> 00:54:24.411
Leave it on.

460
00:54:26.846 --> 00:54:29.549
I'm sorry about the way
my father treated you.

461
00:54:31.351 --> 00:54:34.054
No. Your father was great.

462
00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:37.824
He was great.
The way he took care of Penny.

463
00:54:37.857 --> 00:54:40.960
I mean the way he was with you.

464
00:54:41.061 --> 00:54:43.530
It's really me it has to do with.

465
00:54:45.865 --> 00:54:48.868
Johnny, I came here
because my father--

466
00:54:48.935 --> 00:54:52.605
No. The way he saved her--
I could never do anything like that.

467
00:54:52.706 --> 00:54:56.676
That was something. People treat me
like I'm nothing because I am nothing.

468
00:54:57.510 --> 00:55:00.547
That's not true!
You're everything!

469
00:55:02.315 --> 00:55:05.518
You don't understand the way it is
for somebody like me.

470
00:55:05.585 --> 00:55:07.787
Last month I'm eating candy
to stay alive.

471
00:55:07.887 --> 00:55:10.857
This month, women are stuffing
diamonds in my pockets.

472
00:55:10.924 --> 00:55:13.159
I'm balancing on shit
and I can be down there again.

473
00:55:13.226 --> 00:55:16.863
No, it's not the way it is!
It doesn't have to be that way!

474
00:55:19.866 --> 00:55:22.869
I've never known anyone like you.
You think you can make the world better.

475
00:55:22.902 --> 00:55:25.004
Somebody's lost, you find them.
Somebody's bleeding--

476
00:55:25.071 --> 00:55:28.942
I go get my daddy.
That's really brave, like you said.

477
00:55:29.008 --> 00:55:31.878
That took a lot of guts
to go to him!

478
00:55:31.911 --> 00:55:34.013
You are not scared of anything.

479
00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:38.251
I'm scared of everything!
I'm scared of what I saw.

480
00:55:38.318 --> 00:55:41.955
I'm scared of what I did,
who I am.

481
00:55:42.021 --> 00:55:47.360
I'm scared of walking out of here and
never feeling for the rest of my life...

482
00:55:47.427 --> 00:55:49.662
the way I feel
when I'm with you!

483
00:56:11.384 --> 00:56:13.319
Dance with me.

484
00:56:15.455 --> 00:56:17.223
What, here?

485
00:56:17.290 --> 00:56:18.958
Here.

486
00:59:19.039 --> 00:59:22.275
Singers, dancers, actors,
this is your lucky day!

487
00:59:22.342 --> 00:59:25.745
Auditions for the annual Kellerman
end-of-the-season talent show...

488
00:59:25.845 --> 00:59:27.847
beginning in the playhouse.

489
00:59:34.687 --> 00:59:37.524
- Everyone gonna be in the show?
- We're leaving tomorrow.

490
00:59:37.557 --> 00:59:39.726
Miss the weekend traffic.

491
00:59:39.826 --> 00:59:41.694
But we're paid up 'til Sunday.

492
00:59:41.728 --> 00:59:44.731
- And miss the show?
- I said we're leaving tomorrow.

493
00:59:44.831 --> 00:59:47.834
- I was going to sing in the show.
- It's the big event.

494
00:59:47.867 --> 00:59:50.236
People bring their own arrangements.
You don't want to miss it.

495
00:59:50.336 --> 00:59:52.338
Baby, I need you for props.

496
00:59:53.873 --> 00:59:57.043
Why would you want to leave early?

497
01:00:04.017 --> 01:00:06.853
It was just an idea.
We can stay if you want to.

498
01:00:10.557 --> 01:00:14.160
- So, what were you planning to sing?
- ""l Feel Pretty.""

499
01:00:14.227 --> 01:00:17.230
Or ""What Do the Simple Folk Do?""

500
01:00:17.263 --> 01:00:21.067
Or ""l Feel Pretty.""
What do you think, Daddy?

501
01:00:33.079 --> 01:00:34.514
You look much better.

502
01:00:37.217 --> 01:00:40.754
You just missed your father.
He's such a wonderful man.

503
01:00:42.622 --> 01:00:45.191
I'm sorry. I didn't realize--

504
01:00:45.258 --> 01:00:47.594
You couldn't have. It's okay.

505
01:00:59.606 --> 01:01:02.409
- So, how you doin'?
- I'm okay.

506
01:01:03.977 --> 01:01:06.446
Dr. Houseman says
I'm going to be fine.

507
01:01:07.781 --> 01:01:11.584
- I can still have children.
- Oh, Penny, that's really great.

508
01:01:14.154 --> 01:01:16.923
So, how did it go last night?

509
01:01:16.990 --> 01:01:18.958
Good.

510
01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:24.764
Fine. I didn't do the lifts,
but it was good.

511
01:01:35.475 --> 01:01:40.180
Well, I guess I gonna go.

512
01:01:42.348 --> 01:01:43.983
See ya.

513
01:01:52.058 --> 01:01:54.360
- So, he says you're going to be fine?
- What are you doing?

514
01:01:54.461 --> 01:01:57.897
- I'll tell Max your grandmother died.
- How many times have you told me...

515
01:01:57.997 --> 01:02:00.734
never get mixed-up with them?

516
01:02:00.834 --> 01:02:02.736
I know what I'm doing.

517
01:02:03.837 --> 01:02:07.607
You listen to me.
You've got to stop it now.

518
01:02:23.556 --> 01:02:26.760
Look, I gotta run.
I got a lesson with the Kramers.

519
01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:29.229
They'll kill each other
if I'm not there.

520
01:02:29.295 --> 01:02:31.731
Well, sure. You've gotta go.

521
01:02:34.534 --> 01:02:35.935
I'll see ya.

522
01:02:55.488 --> 01:02:58.391
It's rainy day game time.
Pin the tail on the guest.

523
01:02:58.491 --> 01:03:00.894
Win ten boxes of Kleenex
or a billy goat!

524
01:03:01.961 --> 01:03:05.432
God, I am so sick of this rain.

525
01:03:05.532 --> 01:03:08.234
Remind me not to take my honeymoon
at Niagara Falls.

526
01:03:08.301 --> 01:03:11.438
So, you go to Acapulco.
It'll be fine.

527
01:03:11.504 --> 01:03:15.141
Where is my beige
iridescent lipstick?

528
01:03:15.241 --> 01:03:17.410
I know I put it in this drawer.

529
01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:19.713
Baby, where are you going
in this weather?

530
01:03:19.779 --> 01:03:22.382
Uh, they're having charades
in the west lobby.

531
01:03:22.449 --> 01:03:25.385
Quite the little joiner,
aren't we?

532
01:03:40.166 --> 01:03:43.536
- Have you had many women?
- What?

533
01:03:46.306 --> 01:03:48.141
Baby, come on.

534
01:03:48.174 --> 01:03:50.143
Tell me. I want to know.

535
01:04:01.988 --> 01:04:04.124
You gotta understand
what it's like.

536
01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:06.626
You come from the streets
and suddenly you're up here.

537
01:04:06.726 --> 01:04:10.597
Women are throwing themselves
at you and they smell so good.

538
01:04:10.663 --> 01:04:12.766
They really take care
of themselves.

539
01:04:12.832 --> 01:04:15.268
I never knew women
could be like that.

540
01:04:15.335 --> 01:04:18.605
They're so goddamn rich you think
they must know about everything.

541
01:04:18.671 --> 01:04:21.374
They're slippin' their room keys
in my hand two and three times a day--

542
01:04:21.441 --> 01:04:25.645
different women--
so, I think I'm scorin' big, right?

543
01:04:25.745 --> 01:04:30.150
You think, ""They wouldn't be doing this
if they didn't care about me, right?""

544
01:04:31.351 --> 01:04:34.320
That's all right. I understand.
You were just using them, that's all.

545
01:04:36.289 --> 01:04:37.757
No, that's not it.

546
01:04:38.658 --> 01:04:40.960
That's the thing.
It wasn't like that.

547
01:04:43.063 --> 01:04:45.165
They were using me.

548
01:05:12.726 --> 01:05:14.661
What's your real name, Baby?

549
01:05:16.663 --> 01:05:20.834
Frances, for the first woman
in the Cabinet.

550
01:05:23.036 --> 01:05:26.406
Frances.
That's a real grownup name.

551
01:05:39.586 --> 01:05:42.021
I've decided to go
all the way with Robbie.

552
01:05:44.591 --> 01:05:48.294
No, not with someone like him.

553
01:05:48.361 --> 01:05:52.732
Do you think if we came back for a
ten-year anniversary, it would be free?

554
01:05:52.832 --> 01:05:56.302
It's just wrong this way.
It should be with someone--

555
01:05:56.403 --> 01:06:01.007
With someone that
you sort of love.

556
01:06:01.041 --> 01:06:05.278
Come on.
You don't care about me.

557
01:06:05.378 --> 01:06:08.381
You wouldn't care if I humped
the entire army...

558
01:06:08.448 --> 01:06:11.618
as long as we were on the right side
of the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

559
01:06:11.718 --> 01:06:16.556
What you care about is that
you're not Daddy's girl anymore.

560
01:06:16.589 --> 01:06:19.059
He listens when I talk now.

561
01:06:20.193 --> 01:06:21.594
You hate that.

562
01:06:38.778 --> 01:06:41.514
Two, three, cha-cha-cha.

563
01:06:41.614 --> 01:06:44.484
My frame.
Where's my pleasing arc?

564
01:06:44.584 --> 01:06:48.121
Spaghetti arms! Would you
give me some tension, please?

565
01:06:49.989 --> 01:06:53.359
You're invading my dance space.
This is my dance space.

566
01:06:53.426 --> 01:06:55.829
That's yours. Let's cha-cha.

567
01:07:02.001 --> 01:07:04.671
Don't look down.
Look right here.

568
01:07:13.613 --> 01:07:18.351
- How you call your lover boy?
- Come here, lover boy.

569
01:07:18.451 --> 01:07:21.988
- And if he doesn't answer?
- Oh, lover boy.

570
01:07:22.088 --> 01:07:25.458
- And if still doesn't answer?
- I simply say...

571
01:07:25.492 --> 01:07:28.261
Baby

572
01:07:28.328 --> 01:07:31.164
O-Oh, baby

573
01:07:32.265 --> 01:07:35.101
My sweet baby

574
01:07:36.136 --> 01:07:38.104
You're the one

575
01:07:53.486 --> 01:07:54.988
Takin' dance lessons?

576
01:07:56.022 --> 01:07:57.991
I could teach ya, kid.

577
01:08:02.695 --> 01:08:05.665
My grandfather put me in charge
of the final show.

578
01:08:05.732 --> 01:08:08.034
I want to talk to you
about the last dance.

579
01:08:08.134 --> 01:08:11.204
I'd like to shake things up a bit.

580
01:08:11.304 --> 01:08:13.907
You know, move with the times.

581
01:08:14.007 --> 01:08:16.009
I've got a lot of ideas.

582
01:08:16.076 --> 01:08:18.178
I've been working
with the staff kids...

583
01:08:18.211 --> 01:08:21.748
on a cross between a Cuban rhythm
and soul dancing.

584
01:08:21.848 --> 01:08:24.617
Whoa, boy.

585
01:08:24.718 --> 01:08:26.953
Way over your head here.

586
01:08:27.053 --> 01:08:31.024
You always do the mambo, huh?

587
01:08:31.091 --> 01:08:34.327
Why not dance this year's
final dance...

588
01:08:36.362 --> 01:08:38.231
to the pachenga?

589
01:08:39.399 --> 01:08:40.533
Right.

590
01:08:42.736 --> 01:08:46.439
Well, you're free to do the same,
tired number as last year if you want...

591
01:08:46.539 --> 01:08:49.442
but next year we'll find
another dance person...

592
01:08:49.542 --> 01:08:51.911
- who'll only be too happy--
- Sure, Neil. No problem.

593
01:08:54.114 --> 01:08:56.282
We'll end the season
with the pachenga.

594
01:08:56.383 --> 01:08:57.817
Great idea.

595
01:09:04.391 --> 01:09:08.762
Sometimes he's hard to talk to,
but the ladies seem to like him.

596
01:09:08.795 --> 01:09:11.798
See that he gives you the full half-hour
you're paying him for, kid.

597
01:09:20.673 --> 01:09:23.743
That little wimp. He wouldn't know a
new idea if it hit him in the pachenga.

598
01:09:23.810 --> 01:09:26.112
I could have told him
some new ideas.

599
01:09:26.212 --> 01:09:28.214
Why did you let him
talk to you that way?

600
01:09:28.281 --> 01:09:30.750
- What, fight the boss man?
- You tell him your ideas.

601
01:09:30.817 --> 01:09:33.620
- He's a person like everyone else.
- Look, I know these people.

602
01:09:33.686 --> 01:09:36.389
They are rich and they're mean.
They won't listen to me.

603
01:09:36.456 --> 01:09:38.858
Why not fight harder?
Make them listen.

604
01:09:38.958 --> 01:09:41.828
Because I need this goddamned job
lined up for next summer.

605
01:09:42.929 --> 01:09:44.998
My dad calls me today.

606
01:09:45.098 --> 01:09:47.701
""Good news,"" he says. ""Uncle Paul
can finally get you in the union.""

607
01:09:47.801 --> 01:09:49.035
What union?

608
01:09:50.236 --> 01:09:54.140
The House Painters and Plasterers
Local Number 179 at your service.

609
01:10:02.282 --> 01:10:04.818
I've been thinking a lot
about the Domino Theory.

610
01:10:04.884 --> 01:10:07.253
Now, when Viet Nam falls,
is China Next?

611
01:10:10.056 --> 01:10:11.991
I don't think they saw us.

612
01:10:23.169 --> 01:10:24.637
Fight harder, huh?

613
01:10:25.672 --> 01:10:29.442
I don't see you fightin' so hard,
tellin' Daddy I'm your guy.

614
01:10:29.509 --> 01:10:31.678
I will. With my father,
it's complicated.

615
01:10:31.745 --> 01:10:34.180
- I will tell him.
- I don't believe you, Baby.

616
01:10:37.851 --> 01:10:39.319
I don't think...

617
01:10:40.854 --> 01:10:43.623
that you ever had
any intention of telling him.

618
01:10:44.691 --> 01:10:45.825
Ever.

619
01:10:56.870 --> 01:10:56.870
Well, Cousin, it's almost over.
Labor Day weekend is here.

620
01:10:56.870 --> 01:10:59.706
Well, Cousin, it's almost over.
Labor Day weekend is here.

621
01:10:59.739 --> 01:11:03.476
Soon it's back to the old books and
back to work. What a terrible thought!

622
01:11:13.219 --> 01:11:15.188
Have you seen Johnny?

623
01:11:30.970 --> 01:11:32.272
I'm sorry.

624
01:11:36.743 --> 01:11:38.678
Looks like I picked
the wrong sister.

625
01:11:38.745 --> 01:11:41.548
That's okay, Baby.
I went slummin' too.

626
01:11:59.399 --> 01:12:01.067
Hit me.

627
01:12:08.141 --> 01:12:10.110
Get out of here.
You're not worth it.

628
01:13:08.301 --> 01:13:10.503
Win big, Moe.

629
01:13:10.603 --> 01:13:11.838
As always.

630
01:13:29.389 --> 01:13:33.226
This is our last night together, lover.
I've got something worked out for us.

631
01:13:55.882 --> 01:13:58.184
Excuse me, sir.
The pirate number's next.

632
01:13:58.251 --> 01:14:00.553
Oh, thanks.
Hey, kid.

633
01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:03.356
I've been playing cards all weekend
and I've got an all-night game tonight.

634
01:14:03.423 --> 01:14:06.926
Why don't you give my wife
some extra dance lessons?

635
01:14:16.002 --> 01:14:17.904
I'm sorry, Mr. Pressman...

636
01:14:18.004 --> 01:14:20.473
but I'm booked up for
the whole weekend with the show.

637
01:14:20.573 --> 01:14:22.776
I won't have time
for anything else.

638
01:14:22.842 --> 01:14:26.046
I don't think it'd be fair
to take the money.

639
01:14:50.804 --> 01:14:53.640
I've decided tonight's the night
with Robbie.

640
01:14:53.673 --> 01:14:55.875
He doesn't even know yet.

641
01:15:31.611 --> 01:15:32.846
It's me.

642
01:15:38.017 --> 01:15:39.352
Holy shit!

643
01:16:00.407 --> 01:16:02.509
You wanna hear somethin' crazy?

644
01:16:06.846 --> 01:16:08.314
Last night l--

645
01:16:09.482 --> 01:16:13.753
I dreamt we were walking along
and we met your father.

646
01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:16.489
He said, ""Come on,""
and he put his arm around me.

647
01:16:18.191 --> 01:16:20.293
Just like he did with Robbie.

648
01:17:07.574 --> 01:17:12.812
You know how you feel when you see a
patient and you think he's all right...

649
01:17:12.912 --> 01:17:15.882
then you look at the X rays
and it's nothing like you thought?

650
01:17:15.915 --> 01:17:17.183
What happened?

651
01:17:17.250 --> 01:17:20.720
It's exactly what it's like when you
find out one of your staff's a thief.

652
01:17:20.754 --> 01:17:24.424
Moe Pressman's wallet was stolen
when he was playing pinochle last night.

653
01:17:24.524 --> 01:17:27.527
It was in his jacket hanging
on the back of his chair.

654
01:17:27.594 --> 01:17:31.831
He had it at 1:30 and when he
checked again at quarter of 4::00...

655
01:17:31.898 --> 01:17:34.300
it was missing.

656
01:17:34.401 --> 01:17:38.905
Vivian thinks she remembers
this dance kid Johnny...

657
01:17:38.972 --> 01:17:40.240
walking by.

658
01:17:41.307 --> 01:17:45.211
So we ask him,
""You have an alibi for last night?""

659
01:17:45.245 --> 01:17:47.480
He says he was alone
in his room reading.

660
01:17:48.848 --> 01:17:51.284
There are no books
in Johnny's room!

661
01:17:53.253 --> 01:17:55.321
There's been a mistake.
I know Johnny didn't do it.

662
01:17:55.422 --> 01:17:57.857
There's been similar thefts at the
Sheldrake. It's happened here before.

663
01:17:57.924 --> 01:18:00.293
- Three other wallets.
- I know he didn't do it.

664
01:18:00.393 --> 01:18:02.462
Stay out of it, Baby.

665
01:18:02.562 --> 01:18:06.399
Wait. Don't put those
tables together. Come on.

666
01:18:08.635 --> 01:18:12.706
Daddy, I need your help.
I know Johnny didn't take Moe's wallet.

667
01:18:12.772 --> 01:18:15.141
- Oh? How do you know?
- I can't tell you.

668
01:18:15.241 --> 01:18:20.013
- Just please trust me, Daddy.
- I'm sorry, Baby. I can't.

669
01:18:20.113 --> 01:18:22.182
This Danish is pure protein.

670
01:18:25.018 --> 01:18:28.722
Maybe Johnny didn't do it.
Anyone could've taken it.

671
01:18:28.788 --> 01:18:30.724
Maybe it was, uh--

672
01:18:30.790 --> 01:18:33.660
It could've been that little,
old couple, the Schumachers.

673
01:18:33.727 --> 01:18:36.963
- I saw her with a couple of wallets.
- Sylvia and Sidney?

674
01:18:37.030 --> 01:18:40.066
Baby, you don't go around
accusing innocent people.

675
01:18:40.166 --> 01:18:44.637
I even saw them at the Sheldrake. You
said something was stolen from there.

676
01:18:44.704 --> 01:18:48.308
I got an eyewitness
and the kid has no alibi.

677
01:18:48.375 --> 01:18:52.312
Come on, Neil. You'll learn
what it's like to fire an employee.

678
01:18:53.513 --> 01:18:57.016
Wait a minute. I know Johnny
didn't take the wallet.

679
01:18:57.083 --> 01:19:00.320
I know because he was
in his room all night.

680
01:19:00.387 --> 01:19:04.891
And the reason I know
is because I was with him.

681
01:19:29.315 --> 01:19:31.217
I told you I was
telling the truth.

682
01:19:36.089 --> 01:19:38.058
I'm sorry I lied to you.

683
01:19:40.927 --> 01:19:42.896
But you lied too.

684
01:19:45.098 --> 01:19:48.668
You told me everyone was alike
and deserved a fair break.

685
01:19:48.735 --> 01:19:50.837
But you meant everyone
who is like you.

686
01:19:53.573 --> 01:19:56.843
You told me you wanted me to change
the world, to make it better.

687
01:19:57.911 --> 01:20:00.547
But you meant by becoming
a lawyer or an economist...

688
01:20:00.580 --> 01:20:02.749
and marrying someone
from Harvard.

689
01:20:05.418 --> 01:20:07.954
I'm not proud of myself.

690
01:20:08.054 --> 01:20:11.558
But I'm in this family too. You can't
keep giving me the silent treatment.

691
01:20:15.095 --> 01:20:17.931
There are a lot of things about me
that aren't what you thought.

692
01:20:18.965 --> 01:20:21.935
But if you love me, you have to love
all the things about me.

693
01:20:24.604 --> 01:20:26.539
And I love you.

694
01:20:26.606 --> 01:20:31.177
I'm sorry I let you down.
I'm so sorry, Daddy.

695
01:20:32.078 --> 01:20:34.314
But you let me down too.

696
01:21:04.611 --> 01:21:06.813
I have been lookin'
for you all over.

697
01:21:07.814 --> 01:21:09.649
They found the Schumachers.

698
01:21:09.749 --> 01:21:12.052
Fingerprinted their water glasses.

699
01:21:12.152 --> 01:21:14.988
Found out they were wanted
in Arizona and in Florida...

700
01:21:15.055 --> 01:21:17.490
and they made a fortune
here this summer.

701
01:21:17.524 --> 01:21:19.492
So then it's all right.

702
01:21:20.627 --> 01:21:22.629
I knew it would work out.

703
01:21:22.695 --> 01:21:24.998
- I knew they'd have to apologize.
- I'm out, Baby.

704
01:21:30.236 --> 01:21:32.172
They fired you anyway
because of me.

705
01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:37.177
And if I leave quietly,
I'll get my summer bonus.

706
01:21:40.180 --> 01:21:42.082
So I did it for nothing.

707
01:21:42.182 --> 01:21:46.186
I hurt my family, you lost your job
anyway-- I did it for nothing!

708
01:21:46.252 --> 01:21:48.188
No, not for nothing.

709
01:21:48.254 --> 01:21:51.624
Nobody has ever done anything
like that for me before.

710
01:21:52.392 --> 01:21:55.628
You were right. You can't win
no matter what you do.

711
01:21:55.695 --> 01:21:59.165
Listen to me. I don't want
to hear that from you. You can.

712
01:22:01.067 --> 01:22:03.169
I used to think so.

713
01:22:24.758 --> 01:22:26.860
Dr. Houseman, can l, uh--

714
01:22:28.361 --> 01:22:31.398
Look, I'm going anyway and I know
what you must be thinking.

715
01:22:31.464 --> 01:22:34.434
You don't know
anything at all about me.

716
01:22:34.534 --> 01:22:37.237
I know you want Baby
to be like you.

717
01:22:37.270 --> 01:22:40.106
The kind of person
people look up to.

718
01:22:40.206 --> 01:22:42.409
Baby is like that.
If you could just see--

719
01:22:42.442 --> 01:22:45.412
Don't you tell me what to see.

720
01:22:45.445 --> 01:22:48.081
I see someone in front of me
who got his partner in trouble...

721
01:22:48.114 --> 01:22:50.550
and sent her off
to some butcher...

722
01:22:50.617 --> 01:22:53.887
while he moved on to an innocent,
young girl like my daughter.

723
01:22:59.059 --> 01:23:01.661
Yeah, I guess that's
what you would see.

724
01:23:17.210 --> 01:23:20.480
I can't imagine being here
without you even one day.

725
01:23:20.513 --> 01:23:24.284
Just think, you have more time
for horseshoes and croquet.

726
01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:29.956
Maybe they'll saw you
in seven pieces now.

727
01:23:32.358 --> 01:23:34.461
I guess we surprised everybody.

728
01:23:36.830 --> 01:23:38.765
I guess we did.

729
01:23:46.773 --> 01:23:48.675
Hardly would be sorry.

730
01:23:50.710 --> 01:23:52.178
Neither will l.

731
01:23:59.552 --> 01:24:00.987
I'll see ya.

732
01:24:57.177 --> 01:24:59.145
I'll do your hair.

733
01:25:01.247 --> 01:25:03.349
It could look pretty if--

734
01:25:09.255 --> 01:25:11.691
You're prettier your way.

735
01:25:11.758 --> 01:25:13.026
This way.

736
01:25:35.715 --> 01:25:39.986
Kellermans, we come together

737
01:25:40.086 --> 01:25:44.090
Singing all as one

738
01:25:44.190 --> 01:25:48.294
We have shared another season's

739
01:25:48.361 --> 01:25:52.298
Talent, play and fun

740
01:25:52.365 --> 01:25:56.469
Summer days will soon be over

741
01:25:56.569 --> 01:26:00.673
Soon the autumn starts

742
01:26:00.774 --> 01:26:04.677
And tonight the memories whisper

743
01:26:04.778 --> 01:26:08.148
Softly in our hearts

744
01:26:09.215 --> 01:26:13.086
Join hands and hearts and voices

745
01:26:13.153 --> 01:26:16.556
Voices, hearts and hands

746
01:26:16.623 --> 01:26:20.560
At Kellerman's
the friendships last

747
01:26:20.627 --> 01:26:25.165
Long as the mountain stands

748
01:26:25.231 --> 01:26:29.502
Daytime, nighttime, any hour

749
01:26:29.569 --> 01:26:33.440
Weather rain or shine

750
01:26:33.506 --> 01:26:37.711
Games and lectures
Jokes and music

751
01:26:37.777 --> 01:26:41.848
Happily combine

752
01:26:55.261 --> 01:26:57.163
Good luck in medical school, son.

753
01:26:59.365 --> 01:27:01.901
And I wanted to thank you for your
help with the Penny situation.

754
01:27:01.968 --> 01:27:05.805
- I guess we've all gotten into messes.
- What?

755
01:27:07.507 --> 01:27:10.310
I thought Baby told you.
Look, I'm not sure.

756
01:27:10.377 --> 01:27:13.613
Penny said so, but you know with girls
like that. They're liable to pin it...

757
01:27:13.646 --> 01:27:15.615
on any guy around.

758
01:27:21.855 --> 01:27:24.457
- What's the hot tip for the day?
- Finished.

759
01:27:25.525 --> 01:27:28.395
You and me, Tito.
We've seen it all, eh?

760
01:27:28.495 --> 01:27:33.566
Bubbah and Zeda serving the first
pasteurized milk to the boarders.

761
01:27:33.666 --> 01:27:35.835
Through the war years
when we didn't have any meat.

762
01:27:35.902 --> 01:27:38.638
Through the Depression
when we didn't have anything.

763
01:27:38.671 --> 01:27:41.174
Lots of changes, though, Max.

764
01:27:41.207 --> 01:27:44.711
It's not the changes
so much this time.

765
01:27:44.778 --> 01:27:47.347
It's that it all seems
to be ending.

766
01:27:47.414 --> 01:27:51.418
You think kids want to come with their
parents and take fox-trot lessons?

767
01:27:51.518 --> 01:27:54.654
Trips to Europe,
that's what the kids want.

768
01:27:55.722 --> 01:27:58.291
Twenty-two countries
in three days.

769
01:27:59.392 --> 01:28:01.661
It feels like
it's all slipping away.

770
01:28:02.862 --> 01:28:06.733
But the heartbeats of vacation

771
01:28:06.833 --> 01:28:10.704
There no cares are seen

772
01:28:10.770 --> 01:28:14.741
So let's join in
just one last chorus

773
01:28:14.841 --> 01:28:18.211
Visitors, staff and guests

774
01:28:18.244 --> 01:28:22.782
What we've shared
won't be forgotten

775
01:28:22.882 --> 01:28:25.919
Old friends are the best

776
01:29:01.454 --> 01:29:03.189
Nobody puts Baby in the corner.

777
01:29:04.958 --> 01:29:06.359
Come on.

778
01:29:27.113 --> 01:29:29.315
Sorry about
the disruption, folks...

779
01:29:29.382 --> 01:29:32.652
but I always do
the last dance of the season.

780
01:29:32.752 --> 01:29:35.755
This year somebody told me not to.

781
01:29:35.789 --> 01:29:39.626
So I'm gonna do my kind of dancin'
with a great partner...

782
01:29:40.460 --> 01:29:43.363
who's not only
a terrific dancer...

783
01:29:43.463 --> 01:29:45.932
but somebody who's taught me
that there are people...

784
01:29:45.965 --> 01:29:49.002
willing to stand up for other people
no matter what it costs them.

785
01:29:50.370 --> 01:29:52.939
Somebody who's taught me...

786
01:29:54.874 --> 01:29:56.976
about the kind of person
I want to be.

787
01:29:58.178 --> 01:29:59.646
Miss Frances Houseman.

788
01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:01.881
Sit down, Jake.

789
01:31:25.732 --> 01:31:27.801
I think she gets this from me.

790
01:34:22.409 --> 01:34:25.211
Do you have sheet music
on this stuff?

791
01:34:33.286 --> 01:34:36.389
I know you weren't the one
who got Penny in trouble.

792
01:34:38.558 --> 01:34:41.027
When I'm wrong, I say I'm wrong.

793
01:34:47.567 --> 01:34:49.502
You looked wonderful out there.

794
01:35:47.193 --> 01:35:49.295
Now l

795
01:35:49.362 --> 01:35:53.333
Had the time of my life

796
01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:57.570
No, I never felt
this way before

797
01:35:57.637 --> 01:36:00.040
Yes, I swear

798
01:36:00.106 --> 01:36:04.644
It's so true
And I owe it all to you

799
01:36:04.668 --> 01:36:06.668
