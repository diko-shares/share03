It was in his jacket hanging
on the back of his chair.

at quarter of 4:00...

902

it was missing.

903
01:17:53.951 --> 01:17:59.540
Vivian thinks she remembers
this dance kid, Johnny, walking by.

an alibi for last night?"

Anyone could've taken it.

922

Maybe it was, uh--

923
01:18:50.049 --> 01:18:52.885
You know, it could've been that
little old couple, the Schumachers.

924
01:18:52.969 --> 01:18:56.514
- I saw her with a couple of wallets.
- Sylvia and Sidney?

925
01:18:56.597 --> 01:18:59.642
Baby, you don't go around
accusing innocent people.

926
01:18:59.725 --> 01:19:01.727
Yeah, but I saw them!
I even saw them at the Sheldrake.

927
01:19:01.811 --> 01:19:03.896
Didn't you say something
was stolen at the Sheldrake?

928
01:19:03.980 --> 01:19:07.567
I got an eyewitness

I know Johnny didn't take the wallet.

933
01:19:16.325 --> 01:19:19.871
I know he didn't take it because
he was in his room all night.

934

And the reason I know...

935
01:19:22.331 --> 01:19:24.500
is because I was with him.

the truth, Daddy.

I'm sorry I lied to you.

939
01:20:00.203 --> 01:20:01.370
But you lied too.

940
01:20:04.373 --> 01:20:07.919
You told me everyone was alike
and deserved a fair break.

941

But you meant everyone
who is like you.

942
01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:15.968
You told me you wanted me to change
the world, to make it better.

943
01:20:17.178 --> 01:20:19.764
But you meant by becoming
a lawyer or an economist,

944
01:20:19.847 --> 01:20:21.724
and marrying someone from Harvard.

945
01:20:24.685 --> 01:20:28.648
I'm not proud of myself,
but I'm in this family too,

946
01:20:28.731 --> 01:20:31.067
and you can't keep giving me
the silent treatment.

They found the Schumachers.

They fingerprinted their water glasses,

957
01:21:31.419 --> 01:21:34.213
they found out they were wanted
in Arizona and Florida,

958
01:21:34.297 --> 01:21:36.716
and they made a fortune
here this summer.

959
