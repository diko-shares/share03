40
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.083
These unique devices
that we found

41
00:02:24.125 --> 00:02:26.333
appeared on Earth
before life itself.

42
00:02:28.208 --> 00:02:30.250
We don't know what
mysterious stellar wisdom

43
00:02:30.292 --> 00:02:32.416
created them and left them here,

44
00:02:32.458 --> 00:02:34.750
but we received this gift

45
00:02:34.792 --> 00:02:36.750
on the brink of extinction.

46
00:02:37.542 --> 00:02:40.416
We managed to recreate
the super-tough materials

47
00:02:40.458 --> 00:02:43.500
that the Sphere
and the Engine are made of.

48
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.083
And we precisely copied
both of the devices.

49
00:02:48.042 --> 00:02:52.667
Now, each of them
has an identical twin.

50
00:02:53.375 --> 00:02:56.583
The warp engine
for interstellar flights

51
00:02:56.625 --> 00:02:58.625
has allowed us to find a planet

52
00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.792
more or less suitable
for terraforming.

is for creating life.

59
00:03:18.583 --> 00:03:20.416
After years of research,
we discovered

60
00:03:20.458 --> 00:03:23.292
a way to control
the Sphere and the Engine.

61
00:03:23.875 --> 00:03:27.750
These devices have
their own unique language.

62
00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:30.750
We decoded dozens of commands,

63
00:03:30.792 --> 00:03:34.083
each of which corresponds
to a certain pattern.

64
00:03:34.125 --> 00:03:37.583
This pattern gave
the initial command

65
00:03:37.625 --> 00:03:39.791
that the Sphere
began to carry out

66
00:03:39.833 --> 00:03:42.500

four billion years ago.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.958
[pensive music continues]

186
00:12:36.167 --> 00:12:38.292
[all groan]

187
00:12:40.875 --> 00:12:41.917
Wow.

188
00:12:43.167 --> 00:12:45.583
[mysterious music]

189
00:12:50.167 --> 00:12:51.458
Is this TESS?

190
00:12:54.917 --> 00:12:55.958
[groans]

191
00:12:57.125 --> 00:12:59.292
Richard, did we complete
the maneuver?

192
00:13:00.292 --> 00:13:01.208
Yes, we did.

193
00:13:01.583 --> 00:13:04.625
The star maps, they...
don't match up.

194
00:13:06.458 --> 00:13:07.500
It's not TESS.

195
00:13:08.417 --> 00:13:10.083
[tense music]

196
00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.875
What coordinates did you put in?

197
00:13:17.167 --> 00:13:19.250
Are you sure
they were operational?

198
00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:22.167
Of course, sir.

199
00:13:22.542 --> 00:13:24.042
Did you check the engine?

200
00:13:24.708 --> 00:13:27.208
Everything was done
according to protocol.

201
00:13:27.375 --> 00:13:29.625
If everything was done
to protocol,

202
00:13:29.667 --> 00:13:31.750
we'd be in TESS right now.

203
00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:34.125
The mission failed, Peter.

204
00:13:34.708 --> 00:13:37.000
There is no hope for Earth now.

205
00:13:38.625 --> 00:13:40.083
Permission to check the engine.

206
00:13:40.125 --> 00:13:40.917
[Steve] No.

207
00:13:41.375 --> 00:13:43.041
You're relieved of your duties.

208
00:13:43.083 --> 00:13:45.958
Stay in your bunk
until I say otherwise.

209
00:13:46.125 --> 00:13:48.000
[dramatic music]

210
00:13:50.167 --> 00:13:52.208
[control panel bleeping]

211
00:13:53.583 --> 00:13:54.958
[Peter] Yes, sir.

212
00:13:59.792 --> 00:14:02.083
[tense music intensifies]

213
00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:04.625
[door whooshing]

214

[somber music]

218
00:14:48.542 --> 00:14:51.167
[somber music continues]

219
00:14:57.667 --> 00:14:59.792
[moans] What's this?

220
00:15:01.083 --> 00:15:02.500
In physics,

221
00:15:03.542 --> 00:15:04.958
there is an equation...

222
00:15:05.458 --> 00:15:07.125
the Dirac equation.

223
00:15:08.458 --> 00:15:11.083
When two particles
come into contact,

224
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.208
they become bound forever.

225
00:15:15.792 --> 00:15:17.458
They continue to "feel"
one another,

226
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.000
even if they are...

227
00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:21.042
lightyears apart.

228
00:15:22.208 --> 00:15:24.292
It's called
quantum entanglement.

229
00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.667
That's physics for you?

230
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.083
[Steve snorts]

231
00:15:31.458 --> 00:15:33.208
Not just physics.

232
00:15:35.833 --> 00:15:38.333
[water dripping]

233
00:15:43.125 --> 00:15:44.792

234
00:15:45.167 --> 00:15:47.083

238
00:16:02.125 --> 00:16:04.292
[suspenseful music intensifies]

239
00:16:08.667 --> 00:16:10.667
Try to set the jump trajectory.

240
00:16:11.208 --> 00:16:13.791
Maybe it'll help us
figure out where we are.

241
00:16:13.833 --> 00:16:15.792
No, Steve. [sighs]

242
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.625
Our trajectory's not clear.

243
00:16:18.625 --> 00:16:20.708
The data doesn't make
any sense at all.

244
00:16:21.542 --> 00:16:22.958
Look, we entered
the fourth dimension,

245
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.416
but it's almost as
if we moved along

246
00:16:24.458 --> 00:16:26.458
the coordinate axis
that we can't access.

247
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
And then, we jumped back
into three-dimensional space.

248
00:16:30.458 --> 00:16:32.208
[control panel bleeping]

249
00:16:32.458 --> 00:16:33.750
But where?

250
00:16:34.042 --> 00:16:35.667

251

[whooshes]

254
00:16:49.792 --> 00:16:51.125
Is there anything around us

255
00:16:51.167 --> 00:16:54.041
that can help us
figure out our location?

256
00:16:54.083 --> 00:16:55.083
No.

257
00:16:55.125 --> 00:16:58.625
No landmarks.
Nothing even remotely familiar.

258
00:16:59.417 --> 00:17:02.958
We have no point to set
a return jump.

259
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.458
[snorts] So that means that

260
00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.417
until we figure out where
we are, we can't get back.

261
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:09.875
No.

262
00:17:10.833 --> 00:17:11.958

What's that?

265
00:17:15.375 --> 00:17:18.250
The repair airlock of the engine
compartment was opened.

266
00:17:21.167 --> 00:17:22.583
Why? Who's there?

267
00:17:24.083 --> 00:17:25.000
[clacking and beeping]

268
00:17:25.292 --> 00:17:27.666
[Ryan] Repair Airlock,
this is the captain calling.

269
00:17:27.708 --> 00:17:28.791
Airlock, report.

[Leona sobs] I can't believe it.

287
00:18:36.583 --> 00:18:38.000
[Frank] Calm down, Leona.

288
00:18:39.042 --> 00:18:41.208
We gotta keep our cool
if we wanna survive.

289
00:18:42.292 --> 00:18:44.083
[Frank] We're already
a man down.

290
00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.333
Peter ignored Steve's orders,

291
00:18:47.375 --> 00:18:49.708
went to the engine
compartment...

292
00:18:50.625 --> 00:18:52.917
realized what he'd done,
and that...

293
00:18:53.625 --> 00:18:54.875
That was the end.

294
00:18:55.208 --> 00:18:56.833
[sobs]

295
00:18:57.125 --> 00:18:58.625
Peter wouldn't have!

296
00:19:00.583 --> 00:19:02.083
[Leona] I knew him.

297
00:19:02.833 --> 00:19:05.333
I worked with him
for eight years.

298
00:19:05.375 --> 00:19:07.958
He couldn't have
given up so easily!

299
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.292
Leona, enough!

300
00:19:10.125 --> 00:19:12.000
How can you defend him?

301
00:19:13.333 --> 00:19:16.417
Now we have to deal with
the results of his mistakes.

302
00:19:16.625 --> 00:19:18.208
Do his work for him.

303
00:19:20.583 --> 00:19:23.583
[loudly] One person put
multiple lives in danger.

304
00:19:23.958 --> 00:19:27.375
He almost destroyed humanity's
only chance of survival,

305
00:19:27.417 --> 00:19:29.875
that's who you should
be crying for!

306
00:19:31.917 --> 00:19:34.042

[somber music]

311
00:20:03.917 --> 00:20:06.750
After Rita died,
I didn't wanna live anymore.

312
00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:10.000
But then I thought,

313
00:20:10.417 --> 00:20:13.208
instead of ending it all,
I could make it mean

314
00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:14.458
something.

315
00:20:16.875 --> 00:20:19.375
So I decided to devote myself
to the mission.

316
00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:20.583
[claps]

317
00:20:21.167 --> 00:20:22.708
But now it turns out...

318
00:20:24.375 --> 00:20:25.750
[whimpers] that...

319
00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:29.417
I'm less useful here
than on Earth.

320
00:20:34.375 --> 00:20:35.667
David.

321
00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:39.000
[Steve] Everything
will be alright.

322
00:20:39.042 --> 00:20:40.792
We'll find a way out of this.

323
00:20:42.333 --> 00:20:45.083
The future of Earth
depends on our mission.

324
00:20:45.125 --> 00:20:46.958
Giving up is not an option.

325
00:20:48.542 --> 00:20:49.708
[sighs]

326
00:20:51.125 --> 00:20:54.333
We need to establish what part
of the universe we're in.

327
00:20:54.625 --> 00:20:56.000
Richard, do you have anything?

328
00:20:56.042 --> 00:20:57.208
Not yet.

329
00:20:57.833 --> 00:20:59.291
I'm tracking
the movement trajectories

330
00:20:59.333 --> 00:21:01.208
of the nearest
stars and planets.

331
00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.458
I'll try to calculate
our position from there.

332
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:05.958
David.

333
00:21:06.958 --> 00:21:08.417
What about that planet?

334
00:21:09.375 --> 00:21:10.875
Any data on the probe?

335
00:21:13.083 --> 00:21:14.417
[sighs] Just loaded.

336
00:21:17.875 --> 00:21:19.000
Great.

337
00:21:19.625 --> 00:21:22.500
The surface of the planet
is made of volcanic rock.

338
00:21:23.833 --> 00:21:25.625
There's no biosphere.

339
00:21:26.792 --> 00:21:28.958
There is an atmosphere,
but without oxygen.

340
00:21:29.375 --> 00:21:32.250
Average temperature is
16 degrees Celsius.

341
00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:36.875
The outside environment
isn't aggressive.

342
00:21:37.125 --> 00:21:39.292
All we'll need are
breathing masks.

343
00:21:44.083 --> 00:21:45.083
It's perfect.

344
00:21:46.708 --> 00:21:49.625
If I could choose between
TESS and this planet,

345
00:21:50.417 --> 00:21:51.625
I'd go here.

346
00:21:51.917 --> 00:21:53.875
[suspenseful music crescendos]

347
00:21:54.167 --> 00:21:55.750
[wind blowing]

348
00:21:59.167 --> 00:22:01.458
Did you realize
how lucky we are?

349
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:03.541
What was the likelihood
of winding up

350
00:22:03.583 --> 00:22:05.917
near a planet
that's perfect for the Sphere?

351
00:22:06.208 --> 00:22:07.875
What if this isn't an accident?

352
00:22:07.917 --> 00:22:10.292
What if we were
brought here on purpose?

353
00:22:12.292 --> 00:22:13.125
By whom?

354
00:22:13.167 --> 00:22:15.208
The same thing
that left us the Sphere.

355
00:22:15.583 --> 00:22:17.791
Ryan, get ready to disembark.

356
00:22:17.833 --> 00:22:18.667
What do you mean?

357
00:22:18.875 --> 00:22:20.292
We can complete our mission

358
00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:21.875
on this planet.

359
00:22:22.792 --> 00:22:24.542
But we haven't examined it.

360
00:22:25.792 --> 00:22:27.417
But this is our chance.

361
00:22:27.833 --> 00:22:29.208
If we launch the Sphere
on this planet,

362
00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:31.666
we'll have enough time
to understand where we are.

363
00:22:31.708 --> 00:22:34.125
Then other ships
can repeat our jump.

364
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:36.917
Richard.

365
00:22:37.125 --> 00:22:39.875
Prepare the lander
to go down onto the planet.

366
00:22:39.917 --> 00:22:42.208
But it's a young planet,
the atmosphere is unstable.

367
00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:43.583
And we don't know
anything about it.

368
00:22:43.625 --> 00:22:45.750
It might not be safe
to make a surface landing.

369
00:22:46.333 --> 00:22:49.583
I agree. You are recklessly
risking the safety of the crew.

370
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:51.000
And I'm against it.

371
00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:54.666
Thankfully, I'm the one
who makes the final decisions.

372
00:22:54.708 --> 00:22:58.166
No, Steve. It's too early
for decisions like these.

373
00:22:58.208 --> 00:23:01.042

You'll land here, in the valley.

381
00:23:48.458 --> 00:23:50.375

<i>We're gonna crash

412
00:25:31.458 --> 00:25:33.750

[Frank] <i>If we do that,</i>

[Steve] Amy,

439
00:26:50.458 --> 00:26:52.208
where did you fly off to?

440
00:26:54.667 --> 00:26:56.000
I need you.

441
00:26:58.208 --> 00:27:00.375
[mellow music continues]

[Steve] I got you something.

444
00:27:07.375 --> 00:27:08.708
What's this?

445
00:27:09.833 --> 00:27:11.875
We've been together for a year.

446
00:27:14.042 --> 00:27:16.125
You know, the Sphere
means a lot to me,

447
00:27:16.583 --> 00:27:18.375
but not as much as you do.

448
00:27:20.542 --> 00:27:21.666
Obviously,

449
00:27:21.708 --> 00:27:23.750
I know you two don't get along.

450
00:27:23.792 --> 00:27:26.917
So I thought of creating
something to connect you both.

451
00:27:27.083 --> 00:27:29.125
It's made out of the old Sphere.

452
00:27:30.417 --> 00:27:32.583
There was a fragment
that really stood out.

453
00:27:32.625 --> 00:27:34.916
[snorts] It's so beautiful.

454
00:27:34.958 --> 00:27:36.000
Thank you.

455
00:27:36.458 --> 00:27:38.750
I thought it would be symbolic.

456
00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:42.458
The Sphere is our salvation,

457
00:27:43.375 --> 00:27:44.667
and you are mine.

458
00:27:44.917 --> 00:27:46.917

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.417
for a while.

[control panel bleeping]

472
00:28:48.917 --> 00:28:50.500
[Ryan] What's the status
of the lander?

473
00:28:50.542 --> 00:28:52.208
<i>No critical damage.</i>

474
00:28:53.625 --> 00:28:55.917
<i>But it's almost out of fuel.</i>

475
00:28:58.833 --> 00:29:02.041
Now we can't get back
to the ship. We're stuck here.

476
00:29:02.083 --> 00:29:03.500
Why go back to the ship?

477
00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:06.458
Our plan was to come back
in four years,

478
00:29:06.833 --> 00:29:08.083
and now our main task

479
00:29:08.125 --> 00:29:09.791
is to install and launch
the Sphere.

480
00:29:09.833 --> 00:29:11.375
We're continuing the program.

481
00:29:11.417 --> 00:29:13.333
But we can't carry it out now.

482
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.125
We strayed too far away
from the landing site,

483
00:29:16.167 --> 00:29:17.542
into the mountains.

484
00:29:18.417 --> 00:29:21.375
That means
there should be caves here.

485
00:29:22.125 --> 00:29:24.166
But it's impossible
to deploy domes

486
00:29:24.208 --> 00:29:25.750
on this terrain.

487
00:29:26.708 --> 00:29:28.333
We'll manage without domes.

488
00:29:28.917 --> 00:29:29.666
A deep-enough cave

489
00:29:29.708 --> 00:29:32.500
will provide the right amount
of protection for the Sphere.

490
00:29:33.083 --> 00:29:35.167
There. This cave looks suitable.

491
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:37.750
It's big enough
and easy to access.

492
00:29:38.167 --> 00:29:40.166
Leona, you get the data
on seismic activity.

493
00:29:40.208 --> 00:29:41.708
David, adjust the program.

494
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:43.958
Everyone else,
check the equipment.

495
00:29:45.458 --> 00:29:47.583

[Richard] <i>Captain,
you need to see this.</i>

537
00:33:51.083 --> 00:33:52.083

00:33:55.083 --> 00:33:56.833
We're returning to base.

00:34:06.292 --> 00:34:07.917
do you have any data?

00:34:11.125 --> 00:34:12.375
Not yet.

00:34:16.583 --> 00:34:17.583
Dr. Ross,

547
00:34:17.625 --> 00:34:19.750
martial law is in effect
in this station.

548
00:34:21.167 --> 00:34:22.208
What?

549
00:34:22.458 --> 00:34:23.458
Why?

550
00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:25.041
We have new information.

551
00:34:25.083 --> 00:34:26.375
Richard?

552
00:34:27.167 --> 00:34:28.792
Starting playback.

553
00:34:31.167 --> 00:34:33.875
[eerie music sting]

554
00:34:42.583 --> 00:34:44.500
[on video]
<i>This is Dr. Peter Lehmann.</i>

555
00:34:45.167 --> 00:34:47.083
<i>Against all orders,
I will personally</i>

556
00:34:47.125 --> 00:34:48.917
<i>conduct an engine inspection.</i>

557
00:34:49.375 --> 00:34:50.833
<i>I am now recording
all of my actions</i>

558
00:34:50.875 --> 00:34:53.208
<i>so I'm not accused of
tampering with the results.</i>

559
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:55.875
<i>The security cameras
are switched off</i>

560
00:34:55.917 --> 00:34:57.416
<i>so that I'm not interrupted.</i>

561
00:34:57.458 --> 00:34:59.958
<i>I'm not gonna be the scapegoat.</i>

562
00:35:00.792 --> 00:35:03.500
<i>I'm gonna prove
that I made no mistake.</i>

563
00:35:06.958 --> 00:35:09.000
[suspenseful music]

564
00:35:10.708 --> 00:35:11.833
[slams]

565
00:35:19.792 --> 00:35:22.167
[mechanical clanking]

566
00:35:24.208 --> 00:35:26.792
[whooshing]

567
00:35:34.042 --> 00:35:36.125
[eerie bellowing]

568
00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:44.542
[bellowing intensifies]

569
00:35:47.125 --> 00:35:48.333
[loud growling]

570
00:35:48.667 --> 00:35:49.958
[screams]

571
00:35:50.042 --> 00:35:54.792
- [electronic crackling]
- [wind-like howling]

572
00:35:59.958 --> 00:36:01.167
[crackling stops]

573
00:36:03.875 --> 00:36:05.208
What was that?

574
00:36:07.083 --> 00:36:09.875
[Leona] Some kind of life form?

575
00:36:10.375 --> 00:36:12.000
Was that what killed Peter?

576
00:36:12.667 --> 00:36:14.708
[Richard] I watched all of
the recordings from the cameras.

577
00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:16.666
It shows up by the Sphere
for the first time

578
00:36:16.708 --> 00:36:18.500
right after we left Earth.

579
00:36:18.958 --> 00:36:21.500
That thing crawled out
of the Sphere?

580
00:36:22.417 --> 00:36:24.583
Straight out of the story
of the Trojan horse.

581
00:36:26.625 --> 00:36:29.083
[Richard] <i>And that Trojan
climbed right into the engine</i>

582
00:36:29.125 --> 00:36:30.667
<i>just before the jump.</i>

583
00:36:31.167 --> 00:36:33.792
[David] So maybe
it caused the failure?

584
00:36:35.375 --> 00:36:36.292
[Leona] Richard.

585
00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:38.375
If that Trojan is still
on the ship,

586
00:36:38.417 --> 00:36:39.542
you're in danger.

587
00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:42.458
No. It went down with you...

588
00:36:42.833 --> 00:36:44.167
<i>into the Sphere.</i>

589
00:36:44.667 --> 00:36:46.208
<i>We can track its position.</i>

590
00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:49.333
It causes interference
in the electromagnetic field.

591
00:36:51.167 --> 00:36:52.291
Here's the video
from the cameras

592
00:36:52.333 --> 00:36:53.875
right before the landing.

593
00:36:54.583 --> 00:36:56.917
I've got the first data
from the cave.

594
00:36:58.042 --> 00:36:59.833
Something's strange, Steve.

595
00:37:01.542 --> 00:37:03.417
[computer beeping]

596
00:37:05.208 --> 00:37:10.125
Levels of CO2 and oxidation
inside the Sphere are rising,

597
00:37:10.167 --> 00:37:13.291
but there aren't any biomarkers.

598
00:37:13.333 --> 00:37:15.542
What? Could it be a malfunction?

599
00:37:15.833 --> 00:37:18.041
[David] No,
it's working at full capacity.

600
00:37:18.083 --> 00:37:21.667
Just on a different program
than the one we uploaded.

601
00:37:21.833 --> 00:37:24.792
It's... doing something else.

602
00:37:25.042 --> 00:37:26.125
Regroup.

603
00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:28.125
We're going back to the Sphere.

604
00:37:28.167 --> 00:37:29.625
We need to adjust the settings.

605
00:37:29.667 --> 00:37:32.042
Nobody's going anywhere, Steve!

606
00:37:32.708 --> 00:37:34.875
We'll adjust
the settings later...

607
00:37:35.125 --> 00:37:36.541
after we deal with the threat.

608
00:37:36.583 --> 00:37:39.208
But Steve is the head
of the project.

609
00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:40.375
He calls the shots.

610
00:37:40.417 --> 00:37:41.875
[Ryan] Not anymore!

611
00:37:43.292 --> 00:37:46.167
Now it's a question
of the crew's survival.

612
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.417
Steve, I'm taking command,
you're being relieved.

613
00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:52.000
You can't do that.

614
00:37:52.542 --> 00:37:55.208
The future of mankind
depends on this mission.

615
00:37:55.458 --> 00:37:57.292
Only Dr. Ross can carry it out.

616
00:37:57.625 --> 00:38:01.291
Are you sure that Dr. Ross
is giving us all the information

617
00:38:01.333 --> 00:38:03.833
about what this Sphere
actually is?

618
00:38:04.875 --> 00:38:06.333
[Leona] What are you
talking about?

619
00:38:06.708 --> 00:38:09.042
Richard, show the video
from the cave.

620
00:38:13.167 --> 00:38:16.083
[tense percussive music]

621
00:38:20.167 --> 00:38:22.000
Steve saw the anomaly...

622
00:38:22.792 --> 00:38:25.416
and didn't say anything
to anyone,

623
00:38:25.458 --> 00:38:28.167
risking the lives
of the entire crew.

624
00:38:30.583 --> 00:38:31.917
[Leona] Where did it come from?

625
00:38:32.958 --> 00:38:34.792
Right from the Sphere...

626
00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:39.208
which, as it turns out,
we know too little about.

627
00:38:39.708 --> 00:38:42.625
What if it's an incubator
for those monsters?

628
00:38:43.125 --> 00:38:46.125
I didn't hide a single
confirmed fact

629
00:38:46.167 --> 00:38:48.083
about the Sphere from you.

630
00:38:49.333 --> 00:38:53.083
And there was no sense
in discussing anomalies.

631
00:38:53.125 --> 00:38:56.166
If we had known
about these anomalies,

632
00:38:56.208 --> 00:38:59.583
we would have treated
the Sphere differently,

633
00:38:59.958 --> 00:39:03.083
and Peter would be alive
right now.

634
00:39:05.250 --> 00:39:07.917
[tense music continues]

635
00:39:13.292 --> 00:39:15.708
[music fades]

636
00:39:28.333 --> 00:39:31.958
[dramatic music]

637
00:39:32.625 --> 00:39:34.958
David, I'm sorry
I couldn't make it.

638
00:39:36.375 --> 00:39:38.375
[sighs] It's okay.

639
00:39:39.208 --> 00:39:41.083
I understand how busy you are.

640
00:39:41.667 --> 00:39:44.458
Yes, we don't have
much time to spare.

641
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.417
Why are you here?

642
00:39:47.458 --> 00:39:49.042
The doctor says I'm fine.

643
00:39:49.542 --> 00:39:51.750
Gave me a clean bill of health.

644
00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:55.208
So I'm ready to join everyone
for the pre-launch.

645
00:39:55.625 --> 00:39:56.792
What?

646
00:39:57.792 --> 00:39:59.292
I mean, you...

647
00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:02.583
You're actually planning to fly?

648
00:40:02.958 --> 00:40:06.583
You're the one who made me
a member of the crew.

649
00:40:06.625 --> 00:40:10.083
But that was... before.

650
00:40:11.167 --> 00:40:12.625
Before Rita died?

651
00:40:12.917 --> 00:40:13.917
So what?

652
00:40:14.333 --> 00:40:15.375
I'm telling you,

653
00:40:15.417 --> 00:40:18.083
the psychologist
has confirmed I'm okay.

654
00:40:18.958 --> 00:40:20.667
But to lose a daughter...

655
00:40:21.458 --> 00:40:24.167
David, I'm terribly sorry.

656
00:40:24.625 --> 00:40:27.291
I understand you want
to get back to work,

657
00:40:27.333 --> 00:40:29.750
but this is not the best way.

658
00:40:30.625 --> 00:40:33.083
Right now you need
time to grieve.

659
00:40:33.833 --> 00:40:35.916
Steve, I'm not flying
to forget my daughter.

660
00:40:35.958 --> 00:40:38.667
She'll always be a part of me.

661
00:40:40.667 --> 00:40:43.125
[snorts] I know the Sphere
as well as you do,

662
00:40:43.167 --> 00:40:44.792
and you'll need me there.

663
00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:46.542
David, listen.

664
00:40:47.333 --> 00:40:50.041
All I'm doing is
looking out for you.

665
00:40:50.083 --> 00:40:51.333
What?

666
00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:54.417
You're crossing my name off?

667
00:40:55.042 --> 00:40:56.791
After all we've done,

668
00:40:56.833 --> 00:40:59.917
you're gonna leave me
on the sidelines?

669
00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:05.542
I can help you
to change the future.

670
00:41:06.708 --> 00:41:08.875
Don't take that away from me.

671
00:41:11.375 --> 00:41:13.625
[dramatic music dies down]

672
00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:18.750
[whooshing]

673
00:41:21.417 --> 00:41:24.000
[screeching sound]

674
00:41:25.667 --> 00:41:26.792
What?

675
00:41:27.167 --> 00:41:28.500
We can't leave it like that.

676
00:41:28.958 --> 00:41:31.833
We have to go back to the cave
and restore the settings.

677
00:41:32.167 --> 00:41:34.000
[sighs] But Ryan gave orders...

678
00:41:34.042 --> 00:41:35.333
Just you and me.

679
00:41:36.708 --> 00:41:38.583
We'll go out quietly.

680
00:41:40.542 --> 00:41:42.125
Whatever killed Peter

681
00:41:42.458 --> 00:41:43.958
is still in there.

682
00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:47.833
The Trojan is 30 kilometers away
from the cave right now.

683
00:41:47.875 --> 00:41:49.708
That means,
if it decides to come back,

684
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:52.166
we'll have at least
half an hour to get out.

685
00:41:52.208 --> 00:41:54.500
- What about Ryan?
- Ryan's too careful!

686
00:41:55.333 --> 00:41:56.917
He's wasting time!

687
00:41:57.875 --> 00:42:00.208
Lost days are lost lives.

688
00:42:01.458 --> 00:42:02.416
[pressing keys]

689
00:42:02.458 --> 00:42:03.750
When Rita was dying,

690
00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:06.458
you slowly died with her.

691
00:42:07.375 --> 00:42:09.208
I saw what that was like.

692
00:42:09.958 --> 00:42:11.167
Now imagine

693
00:42:11.375 --> 00:42:15.667
that an entire planet
is dying the exact same way,

694
00:42:15.833 --> 00:42:18.625
slowly, irreversibly,

695
00:42:18.667 --> 00:42:20.875
from the same virus.

696
00:42:22.333 --> 00:42:23.917
[sighs]

697
00:42:25.625 --> 00:42:26.875
[knocks]

698
00:42:28.042 --> 00:42:30.833
[suspenseful music]

699
00:42:36.917 --> 00:42:38.708
[David] What the hell is this?

700
00:42:39.042 --> 00:42:40.583
What's going on?

701
00:42:42.542 --> 00:42:43.958
[Steve] The Sphere did this.

702
00:42:44.208 --> 00:42:45.625
[David] You think
it was a malfunction?

703
00:42:45.667 --> 00:42:47.292
[Steve] Not just a malfunction.

704
00:42:47.583 --> 00:42:50.292
The Sphere is creating
an alien life form.

705
00:42:50.667 --> 00:42:52.208
And incredibly quickly...

706
00:42:52.667 --> 00:42:55.083
Faster than it created
life on Earth!

707
00:42:56.208 --> 00:42:57.208
[David] We shouldn't touch it.

708
00:42:57.250 --> 00:42:58.875
We need to discuss this
with everybody,

709
00:42:58.917 --> 00:43:00.875
We need to set a plan of action.

710
00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:03.625
Someone readjusted
the settings on the Sphere.

711
00:43:03.917 --> 00:43:06.042
[croaking]

712
00:43:06.458 --> 00:43:09.250
[dramatic music crescendos]

713
00:43:09.792 --> 00:43:11.833
The Trojans are getting closer.
We gotta leave!

714
00:43:11.875 --> 00:43:12.875
Just a minute!

715
00:43:13.042 --> 00:43:14.083
Can't you hear me?

716
00:43:14.125 --> 00:43:16.666
There's no point in risking
our lives! Let's go!

717
00:43:16.708 --> 00:43:18.292
Get away from me, damn it!

718
00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:19.583
[thuds]

719
00:43:24.625 --> 00:43:25.417
[hissing]

720
00:43:25.667 --> 00:43:26.708
[bangs]

721
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.500
Have you lost your mind?

722
00:43:28.542 --> 00:43:30.625
It's over. The mission is over!

723
00:43:30.667 --> 00:43:31.917
Deal with it!

724
00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:35.000
The Sphere is hostile!

725
00:43:35.042 --> 00:43:36.125
[blasting]

726
00:43:38.375 --> 00:43:40.750
Put the gun down, David.
Put it down!

727
00:43:40.792 --> 00:43:42.917
You wanna die because
of this piece of shit?

728
00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:44.833
[rapid beeping]

729
00:43:46.125 --> 00:43:48.625

You're a psycho, Steve!

Because of you,
we both almost died!

00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:44.125
This is not about us.

754
00:45:45.292 --> 00:45:47.333
We have to complete the mission.

755
00:45:48.417 --> 00:45:49.708
If you had damaged the Sphere,

756

all of this would have
been for nothing!

757
00:45:52.542 --> 00:45:53.958
Then you should have shot me!

[yells] Why didn't you?

759
00:45:59.208 --> 00:46:01.667
If you threaten the mission
one more time,

760
00:46:02.542 --> 00:46:03.542
I will.

Why did you leave the lander
against my orders?

765
00:46:19.542 --> 00:46:21.375

[Ryan] We don't know.

844
00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:06.083
It damaged the generator,
and the cameras aren't working.

845
00:51:06.542 --> 00:51:09.000
We lost contact
with the ship so...

846
00:51:09.042 --> 00:51:11.083
we have no video from space!

847

Here's the last video
saved on the system.

848
00:51:15.292 --> 00:51:17.667
It was looking for a weak spot
in the hull.

849
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.042
It got in through
the cooling system,

850
00:51:23.583 --> 00:51:25.708
where the steel is the thinnest.

851
00:51:26.208 --> 00:51:28.458
So this thing is smart,
it can think?

852
00:51:29.083 --> 00:51:30.833
Whether it can think or not,

853
00:51:31.333 --> 00:51:34.208
if we smoke it out
and weld the hole shut,

854
00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:35.541
it can't crawl back in.

855
00:51:35.583 --> 00:51:37.666
[David] But how?
How can we smoke it out?

856
00:51:37.708 --> 00:51:39.375
We can't even see where it is!

857
00:51:40.958 --> 00:51:44.542
We have to restore the security
cameras and communications.

858
00:51:44.917 --> 00:51:47.208
The Trojan damaged
the main generator,

859
00:51:47.667 --> 00:51:49.500
but the life support system
is working.

860
00:51:49.708 --> 00:51:52.042
That means,
the backup generator is fine.

861
00:51:52.458 --> 00:51:55.958
We can connect the network
and cameras to it.

862
00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.583
We will have to make our way
blind to the fusebox

863

with no idea
where that bastard is.

864
00:52:00.625 --> 00:52:01.833
It's too risky.

865
00:52:04.458 --> 00:52:05.875
It's all my fault.

866
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.333
So I'll go.

867
00:52:10.750 --> 00:52:12.333

stronger than the Sphere.

are going crazy.

902
00:55:43.458 --> 00:55:44.417

[panting]

904
00:55:48.625 --> 00:55:50.125
Have you ever seen a raging bull

905
00:55:50.167 --> 00:55:52.208
running after the crowds
down a narrow passage

906
00:55:52.250 --> 00:55:53.917
just before the bullfight?

907
00:55:55.667 --> 00:55:57.458
The bull wants
to catch the runners,

908
00:55:58.042 --> 00:56:00.583
but it ends up in the arena
with the matador.

909
00:56:01.542 --> 00:56:03.042
The Trojan is the bull.

910
00:56:03.542 --> 00:56:05.250
It also wants to catch us.

911
00:56:06.292 --> 00:56:08.375
We have a chance to lead it
wherever we want

912
00:56:08.417 --> 00:56:10.375
like outside the lander.

913
00:56:11.292 --> 00:56:13.167
It's a huge risk for everyone,

914
00:56:14.042 --> 00:56:15.625
but it's all worth it.

00:56:20.167 --> 00:56:22.167
[suspenseful music]

917
00:56:25.583 --> 00:56:27.458
The lander has two airlocks,

918
00:56:27.708 --> 00:56:30.208
the central one,
and the one in the lab.

919
00:56:31.125 --> 00:56:32.375
I'll be outside,

920
00:56:32.875 --> 00:56:34.625
in front of the open
central hatch.

921
00:56:35.208 --> 00:56:37.167
I'll be the main decoy.

922
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:42.042
The Trojan will chase me
along the corridors.

923
00:56:42.708 --> 00:56:44.292
Once we get outside,

924
00:56:44.917 --> 00:56:47.541
you shut the engines
to the airlock behind it.

925
00:56:47.583 --> 00:56:48.667
Understood?

926
00:56:48.917 --> 00:56:50.917
[Leona] But in order
to do all that,

927
00:56:51.125 --> 00:56:53.250
we need to get to the airlocks,

928
00:56:53.708 --> 00:56:56.000
and that's where the Trojan is.

929
00:56:56.375 --> 00:56:59.500
[Ryan] We can isolate it
in the main corridor here.

930
00:56:59.542 --> 00:57:01.833
The inner doors
won't hold out long,

931
00:57:02.667 --> 00:57:04.417
but should buy us some time.

932
00:57:06.417 --> 00:57:08.416
I'll lure him into
the inter-hatch space

933
00:57:08.458 --> 00:57:10.000
and lock him in there.

952
00:58:30.750 --> 00:58:33.375
<i>you and I will open

953
00:58:33.792 --> 00:58:35.375
<i>You'll wait for me there,</i>

954
00:58:35.417 --> 00:58:38.250
<i>while I go outside to be
the bait for the Trojan.</i>

955
00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:42.667
But in order for the Trojan
to see me and come out,

956
00:58:43.125 --> 00:58:45.250
both sides of the airlock...

957
00:58:45.917 --> 00:58:49.250
have to be open
outside and inside.

958
00:58:49.625 --> 00:58:53.375
That's why, Leona, we'll
manually open the airlock...

959
00:58:53.875 --> 00:58:56.667
and hide right here,
in the technical bay.

960

00:59:49.083 --> 00:59:51.625
Hurry! It won't
hold up much longer!

975
00:59:51.833 --> 00:59:54.291

Release the Trojan.

What is it?

It's the virus.

It's already in our home,
literally.

We'll work on the vaccine,

1042
01:03:32.250 --> 01:03:34.416
I found a promising pathway.

1043
01:03:34.458 --> 01:03:35.875
The mission will create
a new Earth,

1044
01:03:35.917 --> 01:03:38.458
but we could save this one.

1045
01:03:38.917 --> 01:03:40.708
This is my blueprint
for the vaccine.

1046
01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:42.125
Please go over it.

I'm really happy.

1048
01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:46.708
But it's such poor timing.

- Stay with us.
- I can't.

1053

I have to be there. I have to.

You've done everything
you could!

1055
01:04:01.083 --> 01:04:02.541
We can develop the vaccine now.

1056
01:04:02.583 --> 01:04:04.417
I think I'm onto something.

1057
01:04:05.542 --> 01:04:07.292

what you're infected with.

And they also change
their properties

1073

when they come into contact
with water.

1074
01:05:21.083 --> 01:05:23.666
We studied it,
never understanding that

1075
01:05:23.708 --> 01:05:25.417
one of its functions...

1076
01:05:26.542 --> 01:05:28.583
was to create a Trojan.

1077
01:05:28.958 --> 01:05:32.208
Maybe they are much
more advanced than we are.

1078
01:05:33.667 --> 01:05:34.958

The bacteria
that infected you...

1083
01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:10.375
have an unusually powerful
defense mechanism.

1084
01:06:19.458 --> 01:06:20.708
I've studied them,

1085
01:06:21.125 --> 01:06:22.708
figured out how they work.

1086
01:06:23.958 --> 01:06:27.625
This is what we spent
all those years searching for.

1087
01:06:30.917 --> 01:06:34.208
Your blood holds the key
to the vaccine against the virus

1088
01:06:34.708 --> 01:06:36.958
that's been destroying
life on Earth.

1089
01:06:38.292 --> 01:06:40.250
It doesn't change anything.

1090
01:06:40.292 --> 01:06:41.833
[Steve] Don't you understand?

1091
01:06:42.375 --> 01:06:44.500
We can save the world,

1092
01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.833
and it's all because of you.

1093
01:06:47.542 --> 01:06:49.458
You are the real hero.

01:06:49.833 --> 01:06:51.542

1095
01:06:52.875 --> 01:06:55.042
[Steve] I'll administer
some painkillers.

1096
01:06:55.333 --> 01:06:56.792
You'll feel better.

W-What was that?

1114
01:08:23.917 --> 01:08:25.333
David...

1115
01:08:26.792 --> 01:08:28.917
It's a transponder.

1116
01:08:30.667 --> 01:08:33.500
We can see the connections
of the Sphere.

1117
01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:39.125
This is their way
of colonizing planets.

1118
01:08:39.667 --> 01:08:41.292
[Ryan] How's it going?

1119
01:08:43.125 --> 01:08:44.375
It's a biorobot.

1120
01:08:44.625 --> 01:08:46.875
We have to find a way
to destroy it...

1121
01:08:47.375 --> 01:08:49.583
and restore the settings
in the Sphere.

1122
01:08:50.125 --> 01:08:51.292
No, Steve.

1123
01:08:51.750 --> 01:08:54.625
Too many people have died
because of you already.

1124
01:08:54.667 --> 01:08:55.792
[door closes]

1125
01:08:56.083 --> 01:08:57.208
Wait.

1126
01:08:57.833 --> 01:08:59.250
What did you do?

1127
01:09:01.042 --> 01:09:02.375
Did you lock me in?

1128
01:09:02.792 --> 01:09:05.292
You are under arrest, Steve.

1129
01:09:05.833 --> 01:09:07.083
Ryan,

1130
01:09:07.958 --> 01:09:10.000
we have to work together...

1131
01:09:10.458 --> 01:09:12.416
for Peter and Frank and Leona.

1132
01:09:12.458 --> 01:09:15.333
- Otherwise, they'll die in vain.
- Cut it out, Steve!

1133
01:09:15.375 --> 01:09:17.583
People are expendable to you.

1134
01:09:18.333 --> 01:09:19.250
Ryan!

1135
01:09:19.583 --> 01:09:21.667
Ryan! Ryan!

1136
01:09:23.333 --> 01:09:24.625
He's right.

1137
01:09:32.875 --> 01:09:35.000
[David] It was never about
the salvation of humanity

1138
01:09:35.042 --> 01:09:37.500
that was most important to you,
Steve.

1139
01:09:38.083 --> 01:09:40.500
You always want
to play the hero.

1140
01:09:42.417 --> 01:09:44.250
[David] I know
you just want to win,

1141
01:09:44.292 --> 01:09:47.333
and you don't care
about other people's lives.

1142
01:09:54.958 --> 01:09:56.917
[somber music]

1143

[somber music]

1145
01:10:18.958 --> 01:10:20.333
Amy, talk to me.

1146
01:10:27.875 --> 01:10:29.416
I read your proposal.

1147
01:10:29.458 --> 01:10:31.583
It looks truly promising.

1148
01:10:32.708 --> 01:10:34.250
A real breakthrough.

1149
01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.208
A chance to create the vaccine,
finally the real one.

1150
01:10:39.458 --> 01:10:42.000
[somber music continues]

1151
01:10:43.875 --> 01:10:45.458
But I do need to go...

1152
01:10:46.042 --> 01:10:47.333
for our sake.

1153
01:10:51.083 --> 01:10:53.333
I don't know
what I'll do without you,

1154
01:10:53.958 --> 01:10:55.500
but I promise...

1155
01:10:55.542 --> 01:10:56.917
I'll come back.

1156
01:10:59.250 --> 01:11:00.542
I need you.

1157
01:11:02.583 --> 01:11:04.042
Both of you.

1158
01:11:11.042 --> 01:11:12.458
Tell him...

1159
01:11:13.708 --> 01:11:15.042
or her...

1160
01:11:16.167 --> 01:11:17.542
that Daddy...

1161
01:11:18.375 --> 01:11:21.417
like a god, is out
creating the new Earth.

1162
01:11:24.667 --> 01:11:26.166
You keep saying
you're doing this

1163
01:11:26.208 --> 01:11:27.667
to save everyone.

1164
01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:29.917
But who is everyone?

1165
01:11:30.583 --> 01:11:32.667
You don't see people around you.

1166
01:11:33.333 --> 01:11:35.875
All you care about is
you and your project.

1167
01:11:36.708 --> 01:11:38.000
Why even bother?

1168
01:11:38.625 --> 01:11:41.625
To be hailed as savior?
Is that it?

1169
01:11:42.917 --> 01:11:45.458
[somber music]

1170
01:11:48.042 --> 01:11:49.750
To save our future.

1171
01:11:49.958 --> 01:11:51.125
[Amy scoffs]

1172
01:11:53.833 --> 01:11:56.958
I wonder what it is
you're really trying to save.

1173
01:12:04.875 --> 01:12:06.125
[snorts]

[mellow music]

1176
01:12:25.750 --> 01:12:26.791
Richard,

1177
01:12:26.833 --> 01:12:29.333
you modeled the trajectories
of the nearest stars.

1178
01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:31.125
That didn't give us anything.

1179
01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:32.958
What do you think
you'll find there?

1180
01:12:33.208 --> 01:12:34.958
You said that
when we made the jump,

1181
01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.542
we moved along a coordinate axis
that was inaccessible to us.

1182
01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:41.875
And what if that axis
wasn't spatial?

1183
01:12:45.208 --> 01:12:46.958
Show us how
those stars will look

1184
01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
accounting the expansion
of the universe

1185
01:12:49.042 --> 01:12:51.250
over four billion years.

1186
01:12:53.708 --> 01:12:55.625
Yes, recalculating.

1187
01:13:00.333 --> 01:13:02.250
[mellow music intensifies]

1188
01:13:10.167 --> 01:13:12.292
We didn't move in space.

1189
01:13:13.458 --> 01:13:14.958
We moved in time.

1190
01:13:16.208 --> 01:13:18.167
It's Ursa Major...

1191
01:13:19.292 --> 01:13:20.750
and Orion.

1192
01:13:22.208 --> 01:13:24.375
And there is the North Star.

1193
01:13:25.458 --> 01:13:26.500
And our...

1194
01:13:29.333 --> 01:13:30.458
Sun.

1195
01:13:34.208 --> 01:13:36.583
[mellow music]

1196
01:13:40.083 --> 01:13:42.625
And the Earth was
silent and empty.

1197
01:13:43.958 --> 01:13:45.333
And the darkness...

1198
01:13:45.833 --> 01:13:47.250
over the abyss.

1199
01:13:50.708 --> 01:13:52.083
That means,

1200
01:13:52.125 --> 01:13:53.375
we're on Earth?

1201
01:13:54.458 --> 01:13:56.875
Before the beginning
of life itself?

1202
01:14:07.083 --> 01:14:09.458
About four billion years ago...

1203
01:14:11.625 --> 01:14:13.875
[Richard] <i>But how did you
figure that out?</i>

1204
01:14:20.167 --> 01:14:22.958
[Steve] This is the fragment
that flew off the Sphere

1205
01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
when David fired at it.

1206
01:14:26.750 --> 01:14:28.875
Here is the broken fragment.

1207
01:14:30.167 --> 01:14:31.458
And here's the same piece

1208
01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:34.083
on the bracelet I made for Amy.

1209
01:14:38.958 --> 01:14:42.375
Because it's the exact
same fragment,

1210
01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:45.292
the Sphere here...

1211
01:14:46.083 --> 01:14:47.917
and the other one on Earth...

1212
01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:51.417
are the exact same Sphere.

1213
01:14:52.667 --> 01:14:54.667
But in different times.

1214
01:14:55.667 --> 01:14:58.375
Some civilization sent
the Sphere on Earth

1215
01:14:58.417 --> 01:15:02.208
to create a biosphere
suitable for them.

1216
01:15:02.792 --> 01:15:04.625
But something went wrong.

1217
01:15:05.250 --> 01:15:07.792
But that means
no matter what we do here,

1218
01:15:09.167 --> 01:15:11.542
we won't save
the people on Earth.

1219
01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:13.958
[Steve] There's only
one option left.

1220
01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:17.833
Tell Amy about those
extraterrestrial bacteria...

1221
01:15:18.542 --> 01:15:21.458
and help her
to create the vaccine.

1222
01:15:22.208 --> 01:15:23.750
How do you plan to do that?

1223
01:15:25.083 --> 01:15:27.250
We know that the Sphere...

1224
01:15:27.667 --> 01:15:30.625
will remain in the cave
until our time.

1225
01:15:34.042 --> 01:15:36.166
And that I will make
this fragment

1226
01:15:36.208 --> 01:15:38.250
into a bracelet for Amy.

1227
01:15:40.417 --> 01:15:42.166
I'll write her a message,

1228
01:15:42.208 --> 01:15:44.833
telling her how
to connect the Spheres.

1229
01:15:46.292 --> 01:15:48.667
[whirring]

1230
01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:56.708
But Amy had the bracelet
before we left.

1231
01:15:57.042 --> 01:15:58.917
She didn't say anything
about it.

1232
01:16:00.792 --> 01:16:03.042
I believe Amy will miss me.

1233
01:16:04.542 --> 01:16:06.417
She will come for the bracelet,

1234
01:16:06.583 --> 01:16:07.958
and sooner or later,

1235
01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.875
she will see these inscriptions.

1236
01:16:10.167 --> 01:16:13.125
What's left,
is to put the part back,

1237
01:16:13.167 --> 01:16:15.208
and reconfigure the systems.

1238
01:16:16.667 --> 01:16:18.417
Or the life that we know...

1239
01:16:19.375 --> 01:16:21.000
will never appear.

1240
01:16:22.625 --> 01:16:24.250
Neither will humanity.

Ryan is planning on
blowing up the Sphere.

1251
01:18:09.417 --> 01:18:10.708
Connect me to him.

1252
01:18:12.333 --> 01:18:14.541
He switched off his radio.

1253
01:18:14.583 --> 01:18:17.208
You need to find him
and explain everything.

1254
01:18:18.125 --> 01:18:20.417

Stop right there.

Ryan.

1261
01:18:58.750 --> 01:19:01.167
The Sphere is our only chance.

1262
01:19:02.125 --> 01:19:03.875
Don't even try.

1263
01:19:05.250 --> 01:19:07.708
Okay, okay.

1264
01:19:08.583 --> 01:19:11.042
But your plan still won't work.

1265
01:19:13.458 --> 01:19:14.708
It will.

1266
01:19:15.667 --> 01:19:16.792
You'll see.

1267
01:19:18.417 --> 01:19:21.208
You want to take the bomb
to the cave,

1268
01:19:21.625 --> 01:19:23.750
wait for the Trojan there,

1269
01:19:24.250 --> 01:19:26.708
and blow it up
along with the Sphere.

1270
01:19:27.542 --> 01:19:30.000
But what if it attacks you
on the way?

1271
01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:34.667
Then I will go up...

1272
01:19:35.542 --> 01:19:37.375
in smoke with him.

1273
01:19:38.458 --> 01:19:40.167
And you will lose.

1274
01:19:41.583 --> 01:19:42.708
After all,

1275
01:19:43.375 --> 01:19:46.875
the Sphere will continue
to create the environment

1276
01:19:46.917 --> 01:19:48.625
that the Trojan needs.

1277
01:19:49.792 --> 01:19:51.417
What do you suggest?

1278
01:19:52.250 --> 01:19:53.958
You got a better idea?

1279
01:19:54.542 --> 01:19:56.375
[Steve] Let's lure the Trojan...

1280
01:19:57.042 --> 01:19:58.333
into the lander,

1281
01:19:59.208 --> 01:20:00.917
lock the airlocks,

1282
01:20:01.708 --> 01:20:03.125
and blow it up there.

1283
01:20:03.375 --> 01:20:04.708
Here?

1284
01:20:05.042 --> 01:20:06.458

1286
01:20:09.708 --> 01:20:11.042
[Steve] David, why?

1287
01:20:12.833 --> 01:20:14.042
For Rita.

1289
01:20:16.958 --> 01:20:18.000
[Steve] She died!

1290
01:20:18.292 --> 01:20:20.042
She hasn't died yet...

1291
01:20:21.125 --> 01:20:22.458
[Steve] You're deranged.

1292
01:20:23.167 --> 01:20:24.625
I'm not.

1293
01:20:27.292 --> 01:20:30.333
After what happened in the cave,
I understand.

1294
01:20:31.625 --> 01:20:32.792
[bangs]

1295
01:20:38.208 --> 01:20:40.167
The Trojan didn't kill me.

1296
01:20:41.083 --> 01:20:43.291
And it doesn't do anything
without a reason.

1297

[Trojan croaking]

1298
01:20:51.292 --> 01:20:52.833
It chose me!

1299
01:20:54.583 --> 01:20:56.083
And I will help it.

1300
01:20:57.667 --> 01:21:00.083
We weren't supposed to be here.

1301
01:21:00.125 --> 01:21:01.375
We're a mistake!

1302
01:21:02.333 --> 01:21:06.500
And you are the one who'd
helped me understand that.

1305
01:21:14.750 --> 01:21:18.125
[David] I realized that
we're all just like you, Steve!

1306
01:21:18.167 --> 01:21:20.208
We weren't created right.

1307
01:21:21.167 --> 01:21:24.000
We're a malfunction
of the Sphere!

1308
01:21:26.875 --> 01:21:28.500
But I will fix it.

1309
01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:32.333
David, wake up!

1310
01:21:32.375 --> 01:21:34.625
You can't help Rita like that!

1311
01:21:36.417 --> 01:21:38.625
She wouldn't be born
to suffer...

1312
01:21:39.542 --> 01:21:42.000
and she will not die
at the age of eight.

1313
01:21:42.958 --> 01:21:44.875
No one else will suffer,
Steve, because

1314
01:21:44.917 --> 01:21:48.542
there will never be
any people to begin with!

to quickly identify
