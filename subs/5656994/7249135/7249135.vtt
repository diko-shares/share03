00:00:50.708 --> 00:00:53.333
<i>Today marks a bleak
anniversary for our planet.</i>

3
00:00:53.375 --> 00:00:54.958
<i>Three years ago,
the first case</i>

4
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.458
<i>of a global plant virus
was recorded,</i>

5
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.500
<i>which started to ravage
most of our ecosystems.</i>

6
00:01:00.792 --> 00:01:02.875
<i>The world's leading
research laboratories</i>

7
00:01:02.917 --> 00:01:05.875
<i>have been trying to find a way
to stop this deadly pathogen,</i>

8
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.708
<i>but so far their efforts
have been unsuccessful.</i>

9
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.041
<i>The latest research shows</i>

10
00:01:10.083 --> 00:01:12.625
<i>that people who consume food
infected with the virus</i>

11
00:01:12.667 --> 00:01:15.125
<i>develop severe
autoimmune diseases.</i>

12
00:01:15.167 --> 00:01:15.833
<i>In addition,</i>

13
00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:17.666
<i>the loss of plant life
has contributed</i>

14
00:01:17.708 --> 00:01:20.041
<i>to the concentration of oxygen
in the atmosphere</i>

15
00:01:20.083 --> 00:01:22.250
<i>to decrease to 18%,</i>

16
00:01:22.292 --> 00:01:23.833
<i>the lowest on record.</i>

17
00:01:24.125 --> 00:01:25.958
<i>The rapidly disappearing forests</i>

18
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.500
<i>cannot recycle
enough carbon dioxide</i>

19
00:01:28.542 --> 00:01:31.125
<i>to maintain this level
for much longer.</i>

20
00:01:31.833 --> 00:01:34.041
<i>These atmospheric
changes have caused</i>

21
00:01:34.083 --> 00:01:37.000
<i>an increase in natural disasters
around the globe.</i>

22
00:01:37.125 --> 00:01:40.083
<i>As oxygen levels
drop below 10%,</i>

23
00:01:40.125 --> 00:01:42.166
<i>people will begin to suffocate.</i>

24
00:01:42.208 --> 00:01:44.833
<i>Our beautiful planet
Earth is doomed.</i>

25
00:01:44.875 --> 00:01:47.541
<i>But humanity still
has a chance of survival.</i>

26
00:01:47.583 --> 00:01:49.791
<i>And their best hope
is Project Gemini,</i>

27
00:01:49.833 --> 00:01:51.958
<i>developed by Dr. Steven Ross.</i>

28
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.083
<i>The project centers
around an archeological find</i>

29
00:01:54.125 --> 00:01:57.416
<i>discovered eight years ago
by a group of palaeontologists</i>

30
00:01:57.458 --> 00:02:00.750
<i>who found two unique objects
of extraterrestrial origin.</i>

31
00:02:01.083 --> 00:02:02.625
<i>The artefacts were estimated</i>

32
00:02:02.667 --> 00:02:05.167
<i>to be more than
4 billion years old.</i>

33
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.458
<i>Steven Hawking once said</i>

34
00:02:09.167 --> 00:02:12.417
<i>that if humans are
to survive long-term,</i>

35
00:02:13.042 --> 00:02:15.125
<i>we must find a way
to get off planet Earth.</i>

36
00:02:15.708 --> 00:02:17.708
<i>He was optimistic
about our chances,</i>

37
00:02:18.167 --> 00:02:21.375
<i>and in fact,
it turns out he was right.</i>

38
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.083
These unique devices
that we found

39
00:02:24.125 --> 00:02:26.333
appeared on Earth
before life itself.

40
00:02:28.208 --> 00:02:30.250
We don't know what
mysterious stellar wisdom

41
00:02:30.292 --> 00:02:32.416
created them and left them here,

42
00:02:32.458 --> 00:02:34.750
but we received this gift

43
00:02:34.792 --> 00:02:36.750
on the brink of extinction.

44
00:02:37.542 --> 00:02:40.416
We managed to recreate
the super-tough materials

45
00:02:40.458 --> 00:02:43.500
that the Sphere
and the Engine are made of.

46
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.083
And we precisely copied
both of the devices.

47
00:02:48.042 --> 00:02:52.667
Now, each of them
has an identical twin.

48
00:02:53.375 --> 00:02:56.583
The warp engine
for interstellar flights

49
00:02:56.625 --> 00:02:58.625
has allowed us to find a planet

50
00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.792
more or less suitable
for terraforming.

51
00:03:02.667 --> 00:03:04.250
<i>The unmanned vehicle</i>

52
00:03:04.833 --> 00:03:07.167
<i>completed a "jump"
to the solar system TESS</i>

53
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.916
<i>and returned
with information and samples</i>

54
00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.917
<i>that confirmed our theories.</i>

55
00:03:14.167 --> 00:03:16.625
And this device, this sphere

56
00:03:16.917 --> 00:03:18.541
is for creating life.

57
00:03:18.583 --> 00:03:20.416
After years of research,
we discovered

58
00:03:20.458 --> 00:03:23.292
a way to control
the Sphere and the Engine.

59
00:03:23.875 --> 00:03:27.750
These devices have
their own unique language.

60
00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:30.750
We decoded dozens of commands,

61
00:03:30.792 --> 00:03:34.083
each of which corresponds
to a certain pattern.

62
00:03:34.125 --> 00:03:37.583
This pattern gave
the initial command

63
00:03:37.625 --> 00:03:39.791
that the Sphere
began to carry out

64
00:03:39.833 --> 00:03:42.500
more than
four billion years ago.

65
00:03:56.667 --> 00:03:59.708
The Sphere uses chemical
elements from the environment

66
00:04:00.042 --> 00:04:02.375
and creates a true miracle...

67
00:04:03.375 --> 00:04:04.583
Life!

68
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.666
Now we know life on Earth

69
00:04:06.708 --> 00:04:09.125
was created by this machine.

70
00:04:09.667 --> 00:04:13.125
The Sphere is
our starting point.

71
00:04:15.167 --> 00:04:17.000
Let me introduce you to our team

72
00:04:17.042 --> 00:04:19.042
of leading research scientists.

73
00:04:21.583 --> 00:04:23.375
<i>Our team consists of...</i>

74
00:04:23.667 --> 00:04:25.625
<i>Dr. Peter Lehmann,</i>

75
00:04:25.667 --> 00:04:29.000
the specialist
in extraterrestrial warp engine.

76
00:04:29.667 --> 00:04:31.250
Dr, Leona Redwood,

77
00:04:31.667 --> 00:04:34.000
the terraforming
program builder.

78
00:04:35.542 --> 00:04:38.916
Today we're joined
by military-trained pilots,

79
00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:41.333
headed by Major Ryan Connor.

80
00:04:43.708 --> 00:04:46.625
We are departing
for the solar system TESS,

81
00:04:47.083 --> 00:04:49.958
several hundred light-years
from here.

82
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.875
We will bring the Sphere...

83
00:04:52.917 --> 00:04:56.792
to a planet that has
the right conditions.

84
00:04:57.542 --> 00:04:59.042
And we will create...

85
00:04:59.625 --> 00:05:01.417
Earth 2.0...

86
00:05:02.125 --> 00:05:04.667
a new home for humanity.

87
00:08:24.625 --> 00:08:26.292
What do you think, Peter?

88
00:08:27.417 --> 00:08:29.875
Whoever created this,
where are they now?

89
00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:32.458
Not enough data to say.

90
00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:34.291
And I, don't really like

91
00:08:34.333 --> 00:08:36.333
speculating about
stuff like this.

92
00:08:36.875 --> 00:08:38.500
This isn't about speculation.

93
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:39.958
It's a theory.

94
00:08:41.417 --> 00:08:44.042
Maybe it was
a lost civilization.

95
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:45.875
We know from experience

96
00:08:45.917 --> 00:08:48.791
how highly-developed
civilizations are good

97
00:08:48.833 --> 00:08:50.083
at self-destruction.

98
00:08:50.417 --> 00:08:51.583
Who knows?

99
00:08:52.083 --> 00:08:52.833
Yeah.

100
00:09:18.708 --> 00:09:19.500
Well,

101
00:09:19.542 --> 00:09:22.167
another giant leap
for humanity, eh, guys?

102
00:09:23.917 --> 00:09:26.333
Only this time, literally.

103
00:09:26.375 --> 00:09:27.833
First time in history...

104
00:09:27.875 --> 00:09:29.208
Just as long
as something more

105
00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:32.417
than a bunch of atoms
makes it to the destination.

106
00:09:32.792 --> 00:09:34.000
Still counts.

107
00:09:35.292 --> 00:09:37.542
Say it. First time in history.

108
00:09:41.292 --> 00:09:42.458
Attention.

109
00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:45.417
And prepare for a jump.

110
00:10:18.208 --> 00:10:20.167
All systems are ready.

111
00:10:21.458 --> 00:10:22.708
Coordinates set.

112
00:10:23.042 --> 00:10:25.208
Warpdrive set at maximum power.

113
00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:26.250
Ready.

114
00:10:30.125 --> 00:10:31.208
Engage.

115
00:11:10.042 --> 00:11:11.333
Whoa...

116
00:11:11.417 --> 00:11:12.833
<i>Critical error.</i>

117
00:11:14.708 --> 00:11:15.917
<i>Critical error.</i>

118
00:11:18.167 --> 00:11:19.375
<i>Critical error.</i>

119
00:11:20.167 --> 00:11:21.250
Whoa, whoa...

120
00:11:21.417 --> 00:11:23.042
<i>Critical error.</i>

121
00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:27.750
Whoa, whoa...

122
00:12:40.875 --> 00:12:41.917
Wow.

123
00:12:50.167 --> 00:12:51.458
Is this TESS?

124
00:12:57.125 --> 00:12:59.292
Richard, did we complete
the maneuver?

125
00:13:00.292 --> 00:13:01.208
Yes, we did.

126
00:13:01.583 --> 00:13:04.625
The star maps, they...
don't match up.

127
00:13:06.458 --> 00:13:07.500
It's not TESS.

128
00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.875
What coordinates did you put in?

129
00:13:17.167 --> 00:13:19.250
Are you sure
they were operational?

130
00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:22.167
Of course, sir.

131
00:13:22.542 --> 00:13:24.042
Did you check the engine?

132
00:13:24.708 --> 00:13:27.208
Everything was done
according to protocol.

133
00:13:27.375 --> 00:13:29.625
If everything was done
to protocol,

134
00:13:29.667 --> 00:13:31.750
we'd be in TESS right now.

135
00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:34.125
The mission failed, Peter.

136
00:13:34.708 --> 00:13:37.000
There is no hope for Earth now.

137
00:13:38.625 --> 00:13:40.083
Permission to check the engine.

138
00:13:40.125 --> 00:13:40.917
No.

139
00:13:41.375 --> 00:13:43.041
You're relieved of your duties.

140
00:13:43.083 --> 00:13:45.958
Stay in your bunk
until I say otherwise.

141
00:13:53.583 --> 00:13:54.958
Yes, sir.

142
00:14:57.667 --> 00:14:59.792
What's this?

143
00:15:01.083 --> 00:15:02.500
In physics,

144
00:15:03.542 --> 00:15:04.958
there is an equation...

145
00:15:05.458 --> 00:15:07.125
the Dirac equation.

146
00:15:08.458 --> 00:15:11.083
When two particles
come into contact,

147
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.208
they become bound forever.

148
00:15:15.792 --> 00:15:17.458
They continue to "feel"
one another,

149
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.000
even if they are...

150
00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:21.042
lightyears apart.

151
00:15:22.208 --> 00:15:24.292
It's called
quantum entanglement.

152
00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.667
That's physics for you?

153
00:15:31.458 --> 00:15:33.208
Not just physics.

154
00:16:08.667 --> 00:16:10.667
Try to set the jump trajectory.

155
00:16:11.208 --> 00:16:13.791
Maybe it'll help us
figure out where we are.

156
00:16:13.833 --> 00:16:15.792
No, Steve.

157
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.625
Our trajectory's not clear.

158
00:16:18.625 --> 00:16:20.708
The data doesn't make
any sense at all.

159
00:16:21.542 --> 00:16:22.958
Look, we entered
the fourth dimension,

160
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.416
but it's almost as
if we moved along

161
00:16:24.458 --> 00:16:26.458
the coordinate axis
that we can't access.

162
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
And then, we jumped back
into three-dimensional space.

163
00:16:32.458 --> 00:16:33.750
But where?

164
00:16:49.792 --> 00:16:51.125
Is there anything around us

165
00:16:51.167 --> 00:16:54.041
that can help us
figure out our location?

166
00:16:54.083 --> 00:16:55.083
No.

167
00:16:55.125 --> 00:16:58.625
No landmarks.
Nothing even remotely familiar.

168
00:16:59.417 --> 00:17:02.958
We have no point to set
a return jump.

169
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.458
So that means that

170
00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.417
until we figure out where
we are, we can't get back.

171
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:09.875
No.

172
00:17:12.042 --> 00:17:13.667
<i>Repair Airlock is open.</i>

173
00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:15.125
What's that?

174
00:17:15.375 --> 00:17:18.250
The repair airlock of the engine
compartment was opened.

175
00:17:21.167 --> 00:17:22.583
Why? Who's there?

176
00:17:25.292 --> 00:17:27.666
Repair Airlock,
this is the captain calling.

177
00:17:27.708 --> 00:17:28.791
Airlock, report.

178
00:17:28.833 --> 00:17:31.167
<i>Unidentified object approaching.</i>

179
00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:37.375
<i>Unidentified object approaching.</i>

180
00:17:41.208 --> 00:17:43.417
<i>Unidentified object approaching.</i>

181
00:17:47.208 --> 00:17:49.833
<i>Unidentified object approaching.</i>

182
00:17:52.667 --> 00:17:55.000
<i>Unidentified object approaching.</i>

183
00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:11.625
Shit!

184
00:18:34.167 --> 00:18:36.417
I can't believe it.

185
00:18:36.583 --> 00:18:38.000
Calm down, Leona.

186
00:18:39.042 --> 00:18:41.208
We gotta keep our cool
if we wanna survive.

187
00:18:42.292 --> 00:18:44.083
We're already
a man down.

188
00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.333
Peter ignored Steve's orders,

189
00:18:47.375 --> 00:18:49.708
went to the engine
compartment...

190
00:18:50.625 --> 00:18:52.917
realized what he'd done,
and that...

191
00:18:53.625 --> 00:18:54.875
That was the end.

192
00:18:57.125 --> 00:18:58.625
Peter wouldn't have!

193
00:19:00.583 --> 00:19:02.083
I knew him.

194
00:19:02.833 --> 00:19:05.333
I worked with him
for eight years.

195
00:19:05.375 --> 00:19:07.958
He couldn't have
given up so easily!

196
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.292
Leona, enough!

197
00:19:10.125 --> 00:19:12.000
How can you defend him?

198
00:19:13.333 --> 00:19:16.417
Now we have to deal with
the results of his mistakes.

199
00:19:16.625 --> 00:19:18.208
Do his work for him.

200
00:19:20.583 --> 00:19:23.583
One person put
multiple lives in danger.

201
00:19:23.958 --> 00:19:27.375
He almost destroyed humanity's
only chance of survival,

202
00:19:27.417 --> 00:19:29.875
that's who you should
be crying for!

203
00:20:03.917 --> 00:20:06.750
After Rita died,
I didn't wanna live anymore.

204
00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:10.000
But then I thought,

205
00:20:10.417 --> 00:20:13.208
instead of ending it all,
I could make it mean

206
00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:14.458
something.

207
00:20:16.875 --> 00:20:19.375
So I decided to devote myself
to the mission.

208
00:20:21.167 --> 00:20:22.708
But now it turns out...

209
00:20:24.375 --> 00:20:25.750
that...

210
00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:29.417
I'm less useful here
than on Earth.

211
00:20:34.375 --> 00:20:35.667
David.

212
00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:39.000
Everything
will be alright.

213
00:20:39.042 --> 00:20:40.792
We'll find a way out of this.

214
00:20:42.333 --> 00:20:45.083
The future of Earth
depends on our mission.

215
00:20:45.125 --> 00:20:46.958
Giving up is not an option.

216
00:20:51.125 --> 00:20:54.333
We need to establish what part
of the universe we're in.

217
00:20:54.625 --> 00:20:56.000
Richard, do you have anything?

218
00:20:56.042 --> 00:20:57.208
Not yet.

219
00:20:57.833 --> 00:20:59.291
I'm tracking
the movement trajectories

220
00:20:59.333 --> 00:21:01.208
of the nearest
stars and planets.

221
00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.458
I'll try to calculate
our position from there.

222
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:05.958
David.

223
00:21:06.958 --> 00:21:08.417
What about that planet?

224
00:21:09.375 --> 00:21:10.875
Any data on the probe?

225
00:21:13.083 --> 00:21:14.417
Just loaded.

226
00:21:17.875 --> 00:21:19.000
Great.

227
00:21:19.625 --> 00:21:22.500
The surface of the planet
is made of volcanic rock.

228
00:21:23.833 --> 00:21:25.625
There's no biosphere.

229
00:21:26.792 --> 00:21:28.958
There is an atmosphere,
but without oxygen.

230
00:21:29.375 --> 00:21:32.250
Average temperature is
16 degrees Celsius.

231
00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:36.875
The outside environment
isn't aggressive.

232
00:21:37.125 --> 00:21:39.292
All we'll need are
breathing masks.

233
00:21:44.083 --> 00:21:45.083
It's perfect.

234
00:21:46.708 --> 00:21:49.625
If I could choose between
TESS and this planet,

235
00:21:50.417 --> 00:21:51.625
I'd go here.

236
00:21:59.167 --> 00:22:01.458
Did you realize
how lucky we are?

237
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:03.541
What was the likelihood
of winding up

238
00:22:03.583 --> 00:22:05.917
near a planet
that's perfect for the Sphere?

239
00:22:06.208 --> 00:22:07.875
What if this isn't an accident?

240
00:22:07.917 --> 00:22:10.292
What if we were
brought here on purpose?

241
00:22:12.292 --> 00:22:13.125
By whom?

242
00:22:13.167 --> 00:22:15.208
The same thing
that left us the Sphere.

243
00:22:15.583 --> 00:22:17.791
Ryan, get ready to disembark.

244
00:22:17.833 --> 00:22:18.667
What do you mean?

245
00:22:18.875 --> 00:22:20.292
We can complete our mission

246
00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:21.875
on this planet.

247
00:22:22.792 --> 00:22:24.542
But we haven't examined it.

248
00:22:25.792 --> 00:22:27.417
But this is our chance.

249
00:22:27.833 --> 00:22:29.208
If we launch the Sphere
on this planet,

250
00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:31.666
we'll have enough time
to understand where we are.

251
00:22:31.708 --> 00:22:34.125
Then other ships
can repeat our jump.

252
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:36.917
Richard.

253
00:22:37.125 --> 00:22:39.875
Prepare the lander
to go down onto the planet.

254
00:22:39.917 --> 00:22:42.208
But it's a young planet,
the atmosphere is unstable.

255
00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:43.583
And we don't know
anything about it.

256
00:22:43.625 --> 00:22:45.750
It might not be safe
to make a surface landing.

257
00:22:46.333 --> 00:22:49.583
I agree. You are recklessly
risking the safety of the crew.

258
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:51.000
And I'm against it.

259
00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:54.666
Thankfully, I'm the one
who makes the final decisions.

260
00:22:54.708 --> 00:22:58.166
No, Steve. It's too early
for decisions like these.

261
00:22:58.208 --> 00:23:01.042
I said, we are landing.

262
00:23:43.375 --> 00:23:44.333
<i>Richard,</i>

263
00:23:44.667 --> 00:23:46.000
<i>show me the landing area.</i>

264
00:23:46.083 --> 00:23:47.792
You'll land here, in the valley.

265
00:23:48.458 --> 00:23:50.375
Weather conditions
for descent are optimal.

266
00:23:50.417 --> 00:23:51.458
<i>We're ready.</i>

267
00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:53.542
Initiate undocking procedure.

268
00:23:53.875 --> 00:23:56.458
<i>Undocking sequence initiated.</i>

269
00:24:41.708 --> 00:24:43.458
<i>Engines activated.</i>

270
00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:46.000
<i>Height is 30,000 meters.
Coming down.</i>

271
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.500
A storm front is
heading your way.

272
00:25:04.125 --> 00:25:05.541
<i>It formed a few minutes ago.</i>

273
00:25:05.583 --> 00:25:07.208
<i>I couldn't have predicted it.</i>

274
00:25:07.375 --> 00:25:09.583
<i>Winds are up to
40 meters per second!</i>

275
00:25:09.958 --> 00:25:11.083
So hold on.

276
00:25:11.792 --> 00:25:13.667
Activating braking thrusters.

277
00:25:17.125 --> 00:25:19.500
<i>What the hell was that?
What's going on?</i>

278
00:25:19.875 --> 00:25:20.916
It's the wind.

279
00:25:20.958 --> 00:25:22.208
<i>The storm is quite agressive!</i>

280
00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:28.041
<i>The rate of descent is twice
as high as the landing speed.</i>

281
00:25:28.083 --> 00:25:29.458
<i>We're falling!</i>

282
00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.416
<i>We're gonna crash
on the surface!</i>

283
00:25:31.458 --> 00:25:33.750
I can double the thrust.
It'll slow your fall.

284
00:25:34.292 --> 00:25:35.625
<i>If we do that,</i>

285
00:25:35.667 --> 00:25:38.292
<i>we'll use up all the fuel
for the return flight!</i>

286
00:25:39.083 --> 00:25:40.167
<i>If we don't,</i>

287
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.208
<i>we will die.</i>

288
00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:43.583
The temperature is too extreme.

289
00:25:43.625 --> 00:25:44.958
Your hull is melting.

290
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000
<i>Damn it!</i>

291
00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:47.833
<i>Release the first tank!</i>

292
00:25:59.125 --> 00:26:01.625
I'll try to slow you down
aerodynamically.

293
00:26:01.958 --> 00:26:03.750
I hope the hull holds up.

294
00:26:15.667 --> 00:26:17.833
<i>Hold on tight.
We're coming in hot!</i>

295
00:26:18.458 --> 00:26:19.833
<i>Brace for impact!</i>

296
00:26:40.167 --> 00:26:41.667
Amy?

297
00:26:49.333 --> 00:26:50.208
Amy,

298
00:26:50.458 --> 00:26:52.208
where did you fly off to?

299
00:26:54.667 --> 00:26:56.000
I need you.

300
00:27:05.542 --> 00:27:06.792
I got you something.

301
00:27:07.375 --> 00:27:08.708
What's this?

302
00:27:09.833 --> 00:27:11.875
We've been together for a year.

303
00:27:14.042 --> 00:27:16.125
You know, the Sphere
means a lot to me,

304
00:27:16.583 --> 00:27:18.375
but not as much as you do.

305
00:27:20.542 --> 00:27:21.666
Obviously,

306
00:27:21.708 --> 00:27:23.750
I know you two don't get along.

307
00:27:23.792 --> 00:27:26.917
So I thought of creating
something to connect you both.

308
00:27:27.083 --> 00:27:29.125
It's made out of the old Sphere.

309
00:27:30.417 --> 00:27:32.583
There was a fragment
that really stood out.

310
00:27:32.625 --> 00:27:34.916
It's so beautiful.

311
00:27:34.958 --> 00:27:36.000
Thank you.

312
00:27:36.458 --> 00:27:38.750
I thought it would be symbolic.

313
00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:42.458
The Sphere is our salvation,

314
00:27:43.375 --> 00:27:44.667
and you are mine.

315
00:27:50.667 --> 00:27:51.625
Let's go home.

316
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.875
The sprinklers are about
to start spraying.

317
00:27:54.083 --> 00:27:55.375
Let's stay...

318
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.417
for a while.

319
00:28:48.917 --> 00:28:50.500
What's the status
of the lander?

320
00:28:50.542 --> 00:28:52.208
<i>No critical damage.</i>

321
00:28:53.625 --> 00:28:55.917
<i>But it's almost out of fuel.</i>

322
00:28:58.833 --> 00:29:02.041
Now we can't get back
to the ship. We're stuck here.

323
00:29:02.083 --> 00:29:03.500
Why go back to the ship?

324
00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:06.458
Our plan was to come back
in four years,

325
00:29:06.833 --> 00:29:08.083
and now our main task

326
00:29:08.125 --> 00:29:09.791
is to install and launch
the Sphere.

327
00:29:09.833 --> 00:29:11.375
We're continuing the program.

328
00:29:11.417 --> 00:29:13.333
But we can't carry it out now.

329
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.125
We strayed too far away
from the landing site,

330
00:29:16.167 --> 00:29:17.542
into the mountains.

331
00:29:18.417 --> 00:29:21.375
That means
there should be caves here.

332
00:29:22.125 --> 00:29:24.166
But it's impossible
to deploy domes

333
00:29:24.208 --> 00:29:25.750
on this terrain.

334
00:29:26.708 --> 00:29:28.333
We'll manage without domes.

335
00:29:28.917 --> 00:29:29.666
A deep-enough cave

336
00:29:29.708 --> 00:29:32.500
will provide the right amount
of protection for the Sphere.

337
00:29:33.083 --> 00:29:35.167
There. This cave looks suitable.

338
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:37.750
It's big enough
and easy to access.

339
00:29:38.167 --> 00:29:40.166
Leona, you get the data
on seismic activity.

340
00:29:40.208 --> 00:29:41.708
David, adjust the program.

341
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:43.958
Everyone else,
check the equipment.

342
00:29:45.458 --> 00:29:47.583
Get to work, people.
What are you waiting for?

343
00:31:31.333 --> 00:31:33.333
Conditions
on this planet

344
00:31:33.417 --> 00:31:35.625
are even better
than we expected.

345
00:31:36.208 --> 00:31:38.708
Other ships
will arrive here soon.

346
00:31:39.292 --> 00:31:41.625
A new history of mankind

347
00:31:41.917 --> 00:31:44.833
begins here at this very minute.

348
00:33:42.458 --> 00:33:44.458
We did it.
I can't believe it!

349
00:33:45.292 --> 00:33:47.208
Peter would be so happy.

350
00:33:47.833 --> 00:33:49.250
He worked so hard for this.

351
00:33:49.292 --> 00:33:51.041
<i>Captain,
you need to see this.</i>

352
00:33:51.083 --> 00:33:52.083
He should be here.

353
00:33:52.125 --> 00:33:54.500
Okay, attention, team!

354
00:33:55.083 --> 00:33:56.833
We're returning to base.

355
00:33:58.667 --> 00:33:59.833
Move out.

356
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:05.958
David,

357
00:34:06.292 --> 00:34:07.917
do you have any data?

358
00:34:11.125 --> 00:34:12.375
Not yet.

359
00:34:16.583 --> 00:34:17.583
Dr. Ross,

360
00:34:17.625 --> 00:34:19.750
martial law is in effect
in this station.

361
00:34:21.167 --> 00:34:22.208
What?

362
00:34:22.458 --> 00:34:23.458
Why?

363
00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:25.041
We have new information.

364
00:34:25.083 --> 00:34:26.375
Richard?

365
00:34:27.167 --> 00:34:28.792
Starting playback.

366
00:34:42.583 --> 00:34:44.500
<i>This is Dr. Peter Lehmann.</i>

367
00:34:45.167 --> 00:34:47.083
<i>Against all orders,
I will personally</i>

368
00:34:47.125 --> 00:34:48.917
<i>conduct an engine inspection.</i>

369
00:34:49.375 --> 00:34:50.833
<i>I am now recording
all of my actions</i>

370
00:34:50.875 --> 00:34:53.208
<i>so I'm not accused of
tampering with the results.</i>

371
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:55.875
<i>The security cameras
are switched off</i>

372
00:34:55.917 --> 00:34:57.416
<i>so that I'm not interrupted.</i>

373
00:34:57.458 --> 00:34:59.958
<i>I'm not gonna be the scapegoat.</i>

374
00:35:00.792 --> 00:35:03.500
<i>I'm gonna prove
that I made no mistake.</i>

375
00:36:03.875 --> 00:36:05.208
What was that?

376
00:36:07.083 --> 00:36:09.875
Some kind of life form?

377
00:36:10.375 --> 00:36:12.000
Was that what killed Peter?

378
00:36:12.667 --> 00:36:14.708
I watched all of
the recordings from the cameras.

379
00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:16.666
It shows up by the Sphere
for the first time

380
00:36:16.708 --> 00:36:18.500
right after we left Earth.

381
00:36:18.958 --> 00:36:21.500
That thing crawled out
of the Sphere?

382
00:36:22.417 --> 00:36:24.583
Straight out of the story
of the Trojan horse.

383
00:36:26.625 --> 00:36:29.083
<i>And that Trojan
climbed right into the engine</i>

384
00:36:29.125 --> 00:36:30.667
<i>just before the jump.</i>

385
00:36:31.167 --> 00:36:33.792
So maybe
it caused the failure?

386
00:36:35.375 --> 00:36:36.292
Richard.

387
00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:38.375
If that Trojan is still
on the ship,

388
00:36:38.417 --> 00:36:39.542
you're in danger.

389
00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:42.458
No. It went down with you...

390
00:36:42.833 --> 00:36:44.167
<i>into the Sphere.</i>

391
00:36:44.667 --> 00:36:46.208
<i>We can track its position.</i>

392
00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:49.333
It causes interference
in the electromagnetic field.

393
00:36:51.167 --> 00:36:52.291
Here's the video
from the cameras

394
00:36:52.333 --> 00:36:53.875
right before the landing.

395
00:36:54.583 --> 00:36:56.917
I've got the first data
from the cave.

396
00:36:58.042 --> 00:36:59.833
Something's strange, Steve.

397
00:37:05.208 --> 00:37:10.125
Levels of CO2 and oxidation
inside the Sphere are rising,

398
00:37:10.167 --> 00:37:13.291
but there aren't any biomarkers.

399
00:37:13.333 --> 00:37:15.542
What? Could it be a malfunction?

400
00:37:15.833 --> 00:37:18.041
No,
it's working at full capacity.

401
00:37:18.083 --> 00:37:21.667
Just on a different program
than the one we uploaded.

402
00:37:21.833 --> 00:37:24.792
It's... doing something else.

403
00:37:25.042 --> 00:37:26.125
Regroup.

404
00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:28.125
We're going back to the Sphere.

405
00:37:28.167 --> 00:37:29.625
We need to adjust the settings.

406
00:37:29.667 --> 00:37:32.042
Nobody's going anywhere, Steve!

407
00:37:32.708 --> 00:37:34.875
We'll adjust
the settings later...

408
00:37:35.125 --> 00:37:36.541
after we deal with the threat.

409
00:37:36.583 --> 00:37:39.208
But Steve is the head
of the project.

410
00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:40.375
He calls the shots.

411
00:37:40.417 --> 00:37:41.875
Not anymore!

412
00:37:43.292 --> 00:37:46.167
Now it's a question
of the crew's survival.

413
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.417
Steve, I'm taking command,
you're being relieved.

414
00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:52.000
You can't do that.

415
00:37:52.542 --> 00:37:55.208
The future of mankind
depends on this mission.

416
00:37:55.458 --> 00:37:57.292
Only Dr. Ross can carry it out.

417
00:37:57.625 --> 00:38:01.291
Are you sure that Dr. Ross
is giving us all the information

418
00:38:01.333 --> 00:38:03.833
about what this Sphere
actually is?

419
00:38:04.875 --> 00:38:06.333
What are you
talking about?

420
00:38:06.708 --> 00:38:09.042
Richard, show the video
from the cave.

421
00:38:20.167 --> 00:38:22.000
Steve saw the anomaly...

422
00:38:22.792 --> 00:38:25.416
and didn't say anything
to anyone,

423
00:38:25.458 --> 00:38:28.167
risking the lives
of the entire crew.

424
00:38:30.583 --> 00:38:31.917
Where did it come from?

425
00:38:32.958 --> 00:38:34.792
Right from the Sphere...

426
00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:39.208
which, as it turns out,
we know too little about.

427
00:38:39.708 --> 00:38:42.625
What if it's an incubator
for those monsters?

428
00:38:43.125 --> 00:38:46.125
I didn't hide a single
confirmed fact

429
00:38:46.167 --> 00:38:48.083
about the Sphere from you.

430
00:38:49.333 --> 00:38:53.083
And there was no sense
in discussing anomalies.

431
00:38:53.125 --> 00:38:56.166
If we had known
about these anomalies,

432
00:38:56.208 --> 00:38:59.583
we would have treated
the Sphere differently,

433
00:38:59.958 --> 00:39:03.083
and Peter would be alive
right now.

434
00:39:32.625 --> 00:39:34.958
David, I'm sorry
I couldn't make it.

435
00:39:36.375 --> 00:39:38.375
It's okay.

436
00:39:39.208 --> 00:39:41.083
I understand how busy you are.

437
00:39:41.667 --> 00:39:44.458
Yes, we don't have
much time to spare.

438
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.417
Why are you here?

439
00:39:47.458 --> 00:39:49.042
The doctor says I'm fine.

440
00:39:49.542 --> 00:39:51.750
Gave me a clean bill of health.

441
00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:55.208
So I'm ready to join everyone
for the pre-launch.

442
00:39:55.625 --> 00:39:56.792
What?

443
00:39:57.792 --> 00:39:59.292
I mean, you...

444
00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:02.583
You're actually planning to fly?

445
00:40:02.958 --> 00:40:06.583
You're the one who made me
a member of the crew.

446
00:40:06.625 --> 00:40:10.083
But that was... before.

447
00:40:11.167 --> 00:40:12.625
Before Rita died?

448
00:40:12.917 --> 00:40:13.917
So what?

449
00:40:14.333 --> 00:40:15.375
I'm telling you,

450
00:40:15.417 --> 00:40:18.083
the psychologist
has confirmed I'm okay.

451
00:40:18.958 --> 00:40:20.667
But to lose a daughter...

452
00:40:21.458 --> 00:40:24.167
David, I'm terribly sorry.

453
00:40:24.625 --> 00:40:27.291
I understand you want
to get back to work,

454
00:40:27.333 --> 00:40:29.750
but this is not the best way.

455
00:40:30.625 --> 00:40:33.083
Right now you need
time to grieve.

456
00:40:33.833 --> 00:40:35.916
Steve, I'm not flying
to forget my daughter.

457
00:40:35.958 --> 00:40:38.667
She'll always be a part of me.

458
00:40:40.667 --> 00:40:43.125
I know the Sphere
as well as you do,

459
00:40:43.167 --> 00:40:44.792
and you'll need me there.

460
00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:46.542
David, listen.

461
00:40:47.333 --> 00:40:50.041
All I'm doing is
looking out for you.

462
00:40:50.083 --> 00:40:51.333
What?

463
00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:54.417
You're crossing my name off?

464
00:40:55.042 --> 00:40:56.791
After all we've done,

465
00:40:56.833 --> 00:40:59.917
you're gonna leave me
on the sidelines?

466
00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:05.542
I can help you
to change the future.

467
00:41:06.708 --> 00:41:08.875
Don't take that away from me.

468
00:41:25.667 --> 00:41:26.792
What?

469
00:41:27.167 --> 00:41:28.500
We can't leave it like that.

470
00:41:28.958 --> 00:41:31.833
We have to go back to the cave
and restore the settings.

471
00:41:32.167 --> 00:41:34.000
But Ryan gave orders...

472
00:41:34.042 --> 00:41:35.333
Just you and me.

473
00:41:36.708 --> 00:41:38.583
We'll go out quietly.

474
00:41:40.542 --> 00:41:42.125
Whatever killed Peter

475
00:41:42.458 --> 00:41:43.958
is still in there.

476
00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:47.833
The Trojan is 30 kilometers away
from the cave right now.

477
00:41:47.875 --> 00:41:49.708
That means,
if it decides to come back,

478
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:52.166
we'll have at least
half an hour to get out.

479
00:41:52.208 --> 00:41:54.500
- What about Ryan?
- Ryan's too careful!

480
00:41:55.333 --> 00:41:56.917
He's wasting time!

481
00:41:57.875 --> 00:42:00.208
Lost days are lost lives.

482
00:42:02.458 --> 00:42:03.750
When Rita was dying,

483
00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:06.458
you slowly died with her.

484
00:42:07.375 --> 00:42:09.208
I saw what that was like.

485
00:42:09.958 --> 00:42:11.167
Now imagine

486
00:42:11.375 --> 00:42:15.667
that an entire planet
is dying the exact same way,

487
00:42:15.833 --> 00:42:18.625
slowly, irreversibly,

488
00:42:18.667 --> 00:42:20.875
from the same virus.

489
00:42:36.917 --> 00:42:38.708
What the hell is this?

490
00:42:39.042 --> 00:42:40.583
What's going on?

491
00:42:42.542 --> 00:42:43.958
The Sphere did this.

492
00:42:44.208 --> 00:42:45.625
You think
it was a malfunction?

493
00:42:45.667 --> 00:42:47.292
Not just a malfunction.

494
00:42:47.583 --> 00:42:50.292
The Sphere is creating
an alien life form.

495
00:42:50.667 --> 00:42:52.208
And incredibly quickly...

496
00:42:52.667 --> 00:42:55.083
Faster than it created
life on Earth!

497
00:42:56.208 --> 00:42:57.208
We shouldn't touch it.

498
00:42:57.250 --> 00:42:58.875
We need to discuss this
with everybody,

499
00:42:58.917 --> 00:43:00.875
We need to set a plan of action.

500
00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:03.625
Someone readjusted
the settings on the Sphere.

501
00:43:09.792 --> 00:43:11.833
The Trojans are getting closer.
We gotta leave!

502
00:43:11.875 --> 00:43:12.875
Just a minute!

503
00:43:13.042 --> 00:43:14.083
Can't you hear me?

504
00:43:14.125 --> 00:43:16.666
There's no point in risking
our lives! Let's go!

505
00:43:16.708 --> 00:43:18.292
Get away from me, damn it!

506
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.500
Have you lost your mind?

507
00:43:28.542 --> 00:43:30.625
It's over. The mission is over!

508
00:43:30.667 --> 00:43:31.917
Deal with it!

509
00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:35.042
The Sphere is hostile!

510
00:43:38.375 --> 00:43:40.750
Put the gun down, David.
Put it down!

511
00:43:40.792 --> 00:43:42.917
You wanna die because
of this piece of shit?

512
00:43:46.125 --> 00:43:48.625
Too late.
It's already here.

513
00:45:24.167 --> 00:45:25.625
<i>Airlock closed.</i>

514
00:45:26.042 --> 00:45:28.333
<i>Pressurization complete.</i>

515
00:45:34.417 --> 00:45:35.917
You're a psycho, Steve!

516
00:45:36.125 --> 00:45:38.458
Because of you,
we both almost died!

517
00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:44.125
This is not about us.

518
00:45:45.292 --> 00:45:47.333
We have to complete the mission.

519
00:45:48.417 --> 00:45:49.708
If you had damaged the Sphere,

520
00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:51.833
all of this would have
been for nothing!

521
00:45:52.542 --> 00:45:53.958
Then you should have shot me!

522
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.792
Why didn't you?

523
00:45:59.208 --> 00:46:01.667
If you threaten the mission
one more time,

524
00:46:02.542 --> 00:46:03.542
I will.

525
00:46:11.583 --> 00:46:13.833
Steve, what the hell
are you doing?

526
00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:15.417
Where were you?

527
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.625
Why did you leave the lander
against my orders?

528
00:46:19.542 --> 00:46:21.375
We did what we had to.

529
00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:31.542
You no longer have the right
to make decisions.

530
00:46:32.542 --> 00:46:35.875
I make the decisions
I find necessary.

531
00:46:36.458 --> 00:46:38.958
Or what, what are you gonna do?

532
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.333
Use force?

533
00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:42.208
Then go ahead!

534
00:46:42.250 --> 00:46:44.042
Well, come on!

535
00:46:51.625 --> 00:46:54.333
<i>Module integrity
compromised.</i>

536
00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.250
What did you do?

537
00:46:57.292 --> 00:46:59.708
<i>Module integrity compromised.</i>

538
00:47:03.167 --> 00:47:05.167
<i>Module integrity compromised.</i>

539
00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:35.333
Shh... quiet, sweetie.

540
00:48:37.042 --> 00:48:38.958
You're so close
I'm losing my head.

541
00:48:39.333 --> 00:48:40.667
What is that?

542
00:48:42.125 --> 00:48:43.958
The Trojan's in the lander.

543
00:48:44.458 --> 00:48:46.000
Got a hole in low deck,

544
00:48:46.292 --> 00:48:48.250
and everything covered
in this shit!

545
00:48:48.292 --> 00:48:50.000
So what do we do now?

546
00:48:52.875 --> 00:48:54.958
Quietly and slowly...

547
00:48:55.292 --> 00:48:56.333
let's go.

548
00:49:09.292 --> 00:49:10.583
It's hard to breathe.

549
00:49:39.333 --> 00:49:40.375
Get back.

550
00:49:40.750 --> 00:49:41.708
What?

551
00:49:42.042 --> 00:49:43.417
Why?

552
00:49:44.625 --> 00:49:45.875
It's here.

553
00:50:06.292 --> 00:50:07.333
Run!

554
00:50:29.042 --> 00:50:31.333
What happened? Are you okay?

555
00:50:31.583 --> 00:50:32.750
The Trojan...

556
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.417
The Trojan's in the laboratory!

557
00:50:36.292 --> 00:50:38.125
Do you realize what you've done?

558
00:50:38.167 --> 00:50:40.083
You brought it
down here with you!

559
00:51:00.167 --> 00:51:01.875
Can it get in here?

560
00:51:02.167 --> 00:51:03.250
We don't know.

561
00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:06.083
It damaged the generator,
and the cameras aren't working.

562
00:51:06.542 --> 00:51:09.000
We lost contact
with the ship so...

563
00:51:09.042 --> 00:51:11.083
we have no video from space!

564
00:51:13.208 --> 00:51:15.250
Here's the last video
saved on the system.

565
00:51:15.292 --> 00:51:17.667
It was looking for a weak spot
in the hull.

566
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.042
It got in through
the cooling system,

567
00:51:23.583 --> 00:51:25.708
where the steel is the thinnest.

568
00:51:26.208 --> 00:51:28.458
So this thing is smart,
it can think?

569
00:51:29.083 --> 00:51:30.833
Whether it can think or not,

570
00:51:31.333 --> 00:51:34.208
if we smoke it out
and weld the hole shut,

571
00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:35.541
it can't crawl back in.

572
00:51:35.583 --> 00:51:37.666
But how?
How can we smoke it out?

573
00:51:37.708 --> 00:51:39.375
We can't even see where it is!

574
00:51:40.958 --> 00:51:44.542
We have to restore the security
cameras and communications.

575
00:51:44.917 --> 00:51:47.208
The Trojan damaged
the main generator,

576
00:51:47.667 --> 00:51:49.500
but the life support system
is working.

577
00:51:49.708 --> 00:51:52.042
That means,
the backup generator is fine.

578
00:51:52.458 --> 00:51:55.958
We can connect the network
and cameras to it.

579
00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.583
We will have to make our way
blind to the fusebox

580
00:51:58.625 --> 00:52:00.583
with no idea
where that bastard is.

581
00:52:00.625 --> 00:52:01.833
It's too risky.

582
00:52:04.458 --> 00:52:05.875
It's all my fault.

583
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.333
So I'll go.

584
00:52:10.750 --> 00:52:12.333
I'll watch your six.

585
00:54:25.667 --> 00:54:26.583
Steve,

586
00:54:26.625 --> 00:54:28.542
<i>you need to get
out of there, now!</i>

587
00:55:24.875 --> 00:55:26.083
Are you hurt?

588
00:55:31.458 --> 00:55:33.292
How's the signal
and the cameras?

589
00:55:34.625 --> 00:55:36.750
All there. Back online.

590
00:55:36.792 --> 00:55:37.708
Damn it.

591
00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:40.916
It's transmitting an EMP field
stronger than the Sphere.

592
00:55:40.958 --> 00:55:43.000
The elecronics next to it
are going crazy.

593
00:55:43.458 --> 00:55:44.417
So what now?

594
00:55:48.625 --> 00:55:50.125
Have you ever seen a raging bull

595
00:55:50.167 --> 00:55:52.208
running after the crowds
down a narrow passage

596
00:55:52.250 --> 00:55:53.917
just before the bullfight?

597
00:55:55.667 --> 00:55:57.458
The bull wants
to catch the runners,

598
00:55:58.042 --> 00:56:00.583
but it ends up in the arena
with the matador.

599
00:56:01.542 --> 00:56:03.042
The Trojan is the bull.

600
00:56:03.542 --> 00:56:05.250
It also wants to catch us.

601
00:56:06.292 --> 00:56:08.375
We have a chance to lead it
wherever we want

602
00:56:08.417 --> 00:56:10.375
like outside the lander.

603
00:56:11.292 --> 00:56:13.167
It's a huge risk for everyone,

604
00:56:14.042 --> 00:56:15.625
but it's all worth it.

605
00:56:25.583 --> 00:56:27.458
The lander has two airlocks,

606
00:56:27.708 --> 00:56:30.208
the central one,
and the one in the lab.

607
00:56:31.125 --> 00:56:32.375
I'll be outside,

608
00:56:32.875 --> 00:56:34.625
in front of the open
central hatch.

609
00:56:35.208 --> 00:56:37.167
I'll be the main decoy.

610
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:42.042
The Trojan will chase me
along the corridors.

611
00:56:42.708 --> 00:56:44.292
Once we get outside,

612
00:56:44.917 --> 00:56:47.541
you shut the engines
to the airlock behind it.

613
00:56:47.583 --> 00:56:48.667
Understood?

614
00:56:48.917 --> 00:56:50.917
But in order
to do all that,

615
00:56:51.125 --> 00:56:53.250
we need to get to the airlocks,

616
00:56:53.708 --> 00:56:56.000
and that's where the Trojan is.

617
00:56:56.375 --> 00:56:59.500
We can isolate it
in the main corridor here.

618
00:56:59.542 --> 00:57:01.833
The inner doors
won't hold out long,

619
00:57:02.667 --> 00:57:04.417
but should buy us some time.

620
00:57:06.417 --> 00:57:08.416
I'll lure him into
the inter-hatch space

621
00:57:08.458 --> 00:57:10.000
and lock him in there.

622
00:58:24.542 --> 00:58:26.333
<i>After the Trojan
is blocked,</i>

623
00:58:26.375 --> 00:58:29.167
<i>each one of us will report
to a specific location.</i>

624
00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:30.708
<i>David,</i>

625
00:58:30.750 --> 00:58:33.375
<i>you and I will open
the air hatch in the labs.</i>

626
00:58:33.792 --> 00:58:35.375
<i>You'll wait for me there,</i>

627
00:58:35.417 --> 00:58:38.250
<i>while I go outside to be
the bait for the Trojan.</i>

628
00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:42.667
But in order for the Trojan
to see me and come out,

629
00:58:43.125 --> 00:58:45.250
both sides of the airlock...

630
00:58:45.917 --> 00:58:49.250
have to be open
outside and inside.

631
00:58:49.625 --> 00:58:53.375
That's why, Leona, we'll
manually open the airlock...

632
00:58:53.875 --> 00:58:56.667
and hide right here,
in the technical bay.

633
00:59:30.542 --> 00:59:32.250
<i>When the Trojan
comes after me,</i>

634
00:59:32.625 --> 00:59:34.000
<i>it'll run over here,</i>

635
00:59:34.417 --> 00:59:36.458
<i>past the engine
steering nozzles.</i>

636
00:59:37.208 --> 00:59:39.292
<i>There should be some fuel left.</i>

637
00:59:39.833 --> 00:59:42.583
<i>And if we turn the engine
at the right moment,</i>

638
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:44.583
<i>we won't just smoke it out.</i>

639
00:59:45.083 --> 00:59:46.416
<i>We'll roast it.</i>

640
00:59:46.458 --> 00:59:48.792
Get outta here,
you ugly bastard!

641
00:59:49.083 --> 00:59:51.625
Hurry! It won't
hold up much longer!

642
00:59:51.833 --> 00:59:54.291
Don't panic!
Release the Trojan.

643
00:59:54.333 --> 00:59:55.917
Hide in the tech bay.

644
00:59:57.333 --> 00:59:58.542
You can do it.

645
01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.250
<i>I'm turning on
the engine.</i>

646
01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:24.416
Shit, it's not working!

647
01:00:24.458 --> 01:00:26.125
The Trojan is messing
with the system!

648
01:00:26.167 --> 01:00:27.542
Steve, run!

649
01:00:37.583 --> 01:00:39.083
The engine's on.

650
01:00:39.167 --> 01:00:40.375
Leona, get out!

651
01:00:40.417 --> 01:00:41.500
Get out!

652
01:00:50.292 --> 01:00:52.667
Hurry up!

653
01:00:58.833 --> 01:01:01.625
<i>Ryan, the airlock!
Shut the airlock!</i>

654
01:01:08.125 --> 01:01:08.875
Shit!

655
01:01:29.667 --> 01:01:31.583
Rest in peace, Frank.

656
01:01:57.750 --> 01:02:00.042
A part of its tentacle
was cut off by the door,

657
01:02:00.333 --> 01:02:01.833
and it returned to the cave.

658
01:02:08.250 --> 01:02:10.250
<i>Pressurization complete.</i>

659
01:02:10.542 --> 01:02:13.417
<i>Oxygen levels
returning to normal.</i>

660
01:02:17.708 --> 01:02:19.583
It won't get back in here.

661
01:02:20.167 --> 01:02:22.250
<i>But the Sphere
is under its control.</i>

662
01:02:23.292 --> 01:02:24.500
Not for long.

663
01:02:32.875 --> 01:02:34.000
Amy.

664
01:02:35.542 --> 01:02:36.708
What is it?

665
01:02:39.125 --> 01:02:40.458
It's the virus.

666
01:02:42.125 --> 01:02:45.167
It's already in our home,
literally.

667
01:02:48.542 --> 01:02:50.166
You shouldn't go
on this mission.

668
01:02:50.208 --> 01:02:51.875
Amy, what are you talking about?

669
01:02:52.250 --> 01:02:53.917
We discussed everything.

670
01:02:55.417 --> 01:02:57.917
You've done enough.
This isn't your mission.

671
01:02:58.708 --> 01:02:59.583
Excuse me?

672
01:02:59.625 --> 01:03:01.375
You're not even an astronaut!

673
01:03:06.833 --> 01:03:08.125
You want me...

674
01:03:08.667 --> 01:03:10.875
to walk out a week
before the launch?

675
01:03:11.667 --> 01:03:12.958
What's gotten into you?

676
01:03:18.750 --> 01:03:20.750
We're going to have a baby.

677
01:03:26.125 --> 01:03:27.250
Why?

678
01:03:28.583 --> 01:03:30.292
Just stay.

679
01:03:30.833 --> 01:03:32.208
We'll work on the vaccine,

680
01:03:32.250 --> 01:03:34.416
I found a promising pathway.

681
01:03:34.458 --> 01:03:35.875
The mission will create
a new Earth,

682
01:03:35.917 --> 01:03:38.458
but we could save this one.

683
01:03:38.917 --> 01:03:40.708
This is my blueprint
for the vaccine.

684
01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:42.125
Please go over it.

685
01:03:42.167 --> 01:03:43.375
I'm really happy.

686
01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:46.708
But it's such poor timing.

687
01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:50.583
I won't get to see him grow up.

688
01:03:51.417 --> 01:03:52.416
Steve...

689
01:03:52.458 --> 01:03:54.666
I'm begging you, please,
stay with me.

690
01:03:54.708 --> 01:03:56.458
- Stay with us.
- I can't.

691
01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:59.083
I have to be there. I have to.

692
01:03:59.125 --> 01:04:01.041
You've done everything
you could!

693
01:04:01.083 --> 01:04:02.541
We can develop the vaccine now.

694
01:04:02.583 --> 01:04:04.417
I think I'm onto something.

695
01:04:05.542 --> 01:04:07.292
I need to save the Earth.

696
01:04:27.083 --> 01:04:28.875
We have to study
this creature

697
01:04:29.083 --> 01:04:31.750
so we can understand
what you're infected with.

698
01:04:44.042 --> 01:04:47.333
My guess, it's a biorobot.

699
01:05:02.542 --> 01:05:05.875
These are the same materials
the Sphere is made of.

700
01:05:14.458 --> 01:05:17.000
And they also change
their properties

701
01:05:17.042 --> 01:05:19.792
when they come into contact
with water.

702
01:05:21.083 --> 01:05:23.666
We studied it,
never understanding that

703
01:05:23.708 --> 01:05:25.417
one of its functions...

704
01:05:26.542 --> 01:05:28.583
was to create a Trojan.

705
01:05:28.958 --> 01:05:32.208
Maybe they are much
more advanced than we are.

706
01:05:33.667 --> 01:05:34.958
And better.

707
01:05:51.708 --> 01:05:53.333
David, listen.

708
01:05:57.417 --> 01:05:58.958
Tell me what you found.

709
01:06:02.417 --> 01:06:04.917
The bacteria
that infected you...

710
01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:10.375
have an unusually powerful
defense mechanism.

711
01:06:19.458 --> 01:06:20.708
I've studied them,

712
01:06:21.125 --> 01:06:22.708
figured out how they work.

713
01:06:23.958 --> 01:06:27.625
This is what we spent
all those years searching for.

714
01:06:30.917 --> 01:06:34.208
Your blood holds the key
to the vaccine against the virus

715
01:06:34.708 --> 01:06:36.958
that's been destroying
life on Earth.

716
01:06:38.292 --> 01:06:40.250
It doesn't change anything.

717
01:06:40.292 --> 01:06:41.833
Don't you understand?

718
01:06:42.375 --> 01:06:44.500
We can save the world,

719
01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.833
and it's all because of you.

720
01:06:47.542 --> 01:06:49.458
You are the real hero.

721
01:06:52.875 --> 01:06:55.042
I'll administer
some painkillers.

722
01:06:55.333 --> 01:06:56.792
You'll feel better.

723
01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:07.042
Here goes nothing.

724
01:08:18.958 --> 01:08:20.208
W-What was that?

725
01:08:23.917 --> 01:08:25.333
David...

726
01:08:26.792 --> 01:08:28.917
It's a transponder.

727
01:08:30.667 --> 01:08:33.500
We can see the connections
of the Sphere.

728
01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:39.125
This is their way
of colonizing planets.

729
01:08:39.667 --> 01:08:41.292
How's it going?

730
01:08:43.125 --> 01:08:44.375
It's a biorobot.

731
01:08:44.625 --> 01:08:46.875
We have to find a way
to destroy it...

732
01:08:47.375 --> 01:08:49.583
and restore the settings
in the Sphere.

733
01:08:50.125 --> 01:08:51.292
No, Steve.

734
01:08:51.750 --> 01:08:54.667
Too many people have died
because of you already.

735
01:08:56.083 --> 01:08:57.208
Wait.

736
01:08:57.833 --> 01:08:59.250
What did you do?

737
01:09:01.042 --> 01:09:02.375
Did you lock me in?

738
01:09:02.792 --> 01:09:05.292
You are under arrest, Steve.

739
01:09:05.833 --> 01:09:07.083
Ryan,

740
01:09:07.958 --> 01:09:10.000
we have to work together...

741
01:09:10.458 --> 01:09:12.416
for Peter and Frank and Leona.

742
01:09:12.458 --> 01:09:15.333
- Otherwise, they'll die in vain.
- Cut it out, Steve!

743
01:09:15.375 --> 01:09:17.583
People are expendable to you.

744
01:09:18.333 --> 01:09:19.250
Ryan!

745
01:09:19.583 --> 01:09:21.667
Ryan! Ryan!

746
01:09:23.333 --> 01:09:24.625
He's right.

747
01:09:32.875 --> 01:09:35.000
It was never about
the salvation of humanity

748
01:09:35.042 --> 01:09:37.500
that was most important to you,
Steve.

749
01:09:38.083 --> 01:09:40.500
You always want
to play the hero.

750
01:09:42.417 --> 01:09:44.250
I know
you just want to win,

751
01:09:44.292 --> 01:09:47.333
and you don't care
about other people's lives.

752
01:10:18.958 --> 01:10:20.333
Amy, talk to me.

753
01:10:27.875 --> 01:10:29.416
I read your proposal.

754
01:10:29.458 --> 01:10:31.583
It looks truly promising.

755
01:10:32.708 --> 01:10:34.250
A real breakthrough.

756
01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.208
A chance to create the vaccine,
finally the real one.

757
01:10:43.875 --> 01:10:45.458
But I do need to go...

758
01:10:46.042 --> 01:10:47.333
for our sake.

759
01:10:51.083 --> 01:10:53.333
I don't know
what I'll do without you,

760
01:10:53.958 --> 01:10:55.500
but I promise...

761
01:10:55.542 --> 01:10:56.917
I'll come back.

762
01:10:59.250 --> 01:11:00.542
I need you.

763
01:11:02.583 --> 01:11:04.042
Both of you.

764
01:11:11.042 --> 01:11:12.458
Tell him...

765
01:11:13.708 --> 01:11:15.042
or her...

766
01:11:16.167 --> 01:11:17.542
that Daddy...

767
01:11:18.375 --> 01:11:21.417
like a god, is out
creating the new Earth.

768
01:11:24.667 --> 01:11:26.166
You keep saying
you're doing this

769
01:11:26.208 --> 01:11:27.667
to save everyone.

770
01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:29.917
But who is everyone?

771
01:11:30.583 --> 01:11:32.667
You don't see people around you.

772
01:11:33.333 --> 01:11:35.875
All you care about is
you and your project.

773
01:11:36.708 --> 01:11:38.000
Why even bother?

774
01:11:38.625 --> 01:11:41.625
To be hailed as savior?
Is that it?

775
01:11:48.042 --> 01:11:49.750
To save our future.

776
01:11:53.833 --> 01:11:56.958
I wonder what it is
you're really trying to save.

777
01:12:25.750 --> 01:12:26.791
Richard,

778
01:12:26.833 --> 01:12:29.333
you modeled the trajectories
of the nearest stars.

779
01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:31.125
That didn't give us anything.

780
01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:32.958
What do you think
you'll find there?

781
01:12:33.208 --> 01:12:34.958
You said that
when we made the jump,

782
01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.542
we moved along a coordinate axis
that was inaccessible to us.

783
01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:41.875
And what if that axis
wasn't spatial?

784
01:12:45.208 --> 01:12:46.958
Show us how
those stars will look

785
01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
accounting the expansion
of the universe

786
01:12:49.042 --> 01:12:51.250
over four billion years.

787
01:12:53.708 --> 01:12:55.625
Yes, recalculating.

788
01:13:10.167 --> 01:13:12.292
We didn't move in space.

789
01:13:13.458 --> 01:13:14.958
We moved in time.

790
01:13:16.208 --> 01:13:18.167
It's Ursa Major...

791
01:13:19.292 --> 01:13:20.750
and Orion.

792
01:13:22.208 --> 01:13:24.375
And there is the North Star.

793
01:13:25.458 --> 01:13:26.500
And our...

794
01:13:29.333 --> 01:13:30.458
Sun.

795
01:13:40.083 --> 01:13:42.625
And the Earth was
silent and empty.

796
01:13:43.958 --> 01:13:45.333
And the darkness...

797
01:13:45.833 --> 01:13:47.250
over the abyss.

798
01:13:50.708 --> 01:13:52.083
That means,

799
01:13:52.125 --> 01:13:53.375
we're on Earth?

800
01:13:54.458 --> 01:13:56.875
Before the beginning
of life itself?

801
01:14:07.083 --> 01:14:09.458
About four billion years ago...

802
01:14:11.625 --> 01:14:13.875
<i>But how did you
figure that out?</i>

803
01:14:20.167 --> 01:14:22.958
This is the fragment
that flew off the Sphere

804
01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
when David fired at it.

805
01:14:26.750 --> 01:14:28.875
Here is the broken fragment.

806
01:14:30.167 --> 01:14:31.458
And here's the same piece

807
01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:34.083
on the bracelet I made for Amy.

808
01:14:38.958 --> 01:14:42.375
Because it's the exact
same fragment,

809
01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:45.292
the Sphere here...

810
01:14:46.083 --> 01:14:47.917
and the other one on Earth...

811
01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:51.417
are the exact same Sphere.

812
01:14:52.667 --> 01:14:54.667
But in different times.

813
01:14:55.667 --> 01:14:58.375
Some civilization sent
the Sphere on Earth

814
01:14:58.417 --> 01:15:02.208
to create a biosphere
suitable for them.

815
01:15:02.792 --> 01:15:04.625
But something went wrong.

816
01:15:05.250 --> 01:15:07.792
But that means
no matter what we do here,

817
01:15:09.167 --> 01:15:11.542
we won't save
the people on Earth.

818
01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:13.958
There's only
one option left.

819
01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:17.833
Tell Amy about those
extraterrestrial bacteria...

820
01:15:18.542 --> 01:15:21.458
and help her
to create the vaccine.

821
01:15:22.208 --> 01:15:23.750
How do you plan to do that?

822
01:15:25.083 --> 01:15:27.250
We know that the Sphere...

823
01:15:27.667 --> 01:15:30.625
will remain in the cave
until our time.

824
01:15:34.042 --> 01:15:36.166
And that I will make
this fragment

825
01:15:36.208 --> 01:15:38.250
into a bracelet for Amy.

826
01:15:40.417 --> 01:15:42.166
I'll write her a message,

827
01:15:42.208 --> 01:15:44.833
telling her how
to connect the Spheres.

828
01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:56.708
But Amy had the bracelet
before we left.

829
01:15:57.042 --> 01:15:58.917
She didn't say anything
about it.

830
01:16:00.792 --> 01:16:03.042
I believe Amy will miss me.

831
01:16:04.542 --> 01:16:06.417
She will come for the bracelet,

832
01:16:06.583 --> 01:16:07.958
and sooner or later,

833
01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.875
she will see these inscriptions.

834
01:16:10.167 --> 01:16:13.125
What's left,
is to put the part back,

835
01:16:13.167 --> 01:16:15.208
and reconfigure the systems.

836
01:16:16.667 --> 01:16:18.417
Or the life that we know...

837
01:16:19.375 --> 01:16:21.000
will never appear.

838
01:16:22.625 --> 01:16:24.250
Neither will humanity.

839
01:18:03.208 --> 01:18:05.250
<i>Steve! Steve!</i>

840
01:18:05.708 --> 01:18:07.958
Ryan is planning on
blowing up the Sphere.

841
01:18:09.417 --> 01:18:10.708
Connect me to him.

842
01:18:12.333 --> 01:18:14.541
He switched off his radio.

843
01:18:14.583 --> 01:18:17.208
You need to find him
and explain everything.

844
01:18:18.125 --> 01:18:20.417
<i>Go, I've reopened the airlock.</i>

845
01:18:50.375 --> 01:18:51.875
Stop right there.

846
01:18:54.583 --> 01:18:55.833
Ryan.

847
01:18:58.750 --> 01:19:01.167
The Sphere is our only chance.

848
01:19:02.125 --> 01:19:03.875
Don't even try.

849
01:19:05.250 --> 01:19:07.708
Okay, okay.

850
01:19:08.583 --> 01:19:11.042
But your plan still won't work.

851
01:19:13.458 --> 01:19:14.708
It will.

852
01:19:15.667 --> 01:19:16.792
You'll see.

853
01:19:18.417 --> 01:19:21.208
You want to take the bomb
to the cave,

854
01:19:21.625 --> 01:19:23.750
wait for the Trojan there,

855
01:19:24.250 --> 01:19:26.708
and blow it up
along with the Sphere.

856
01:19:27.542 --> 01:19:30.000
But what if it attacks you
on the way?

857
01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:34.667
Then I will go up...

858
01:19:35.542 --> 01:19:37.375
in smoke with him.

859
01:19:38.458 --> 01:19:40.167
And you will lose.

860
01:19:41.583 --> 01:19:42.708
After all,

861
01:19:43.375 --> 01:19:46.875
the Sphere will continue
to create the environment

862
01:19:46.917 --> 01:19:48.625
that the Trojan needs.

863
01:19:49.792 --> 01:19:51.417
What do you suggest?

864
01:19:52.250 --> 01:19:53.958
You got a better idea?

865
01:19:54.542 --> 01:19:56.375
Let's lure the Trojan...

866
01:19:57.042 --> 01:19:58.333
into the lander,

867
01:19:59.208 --> 01:20:00.917
lock the airlocks,

868
01:20:01.708 --> 01:20:03.125
and blow it up there.

869
01:20:03.375 --> 01:20:04.708
Here?

870
01:20:05.042 --> 01:20:06.458
Oh!

871
01:20:09.708 --> 01:20:11.042
David, why?

872
01:20:12.833 --> 01:20:14.042
For Rita.

873
01:20:16.958 --> 01:20:18.000
She died!

874
01:20:18.292 --> 01:20:20.042
She hasn't died yet...

875
01:20:21.125 --> 01:20:22.458
You're deranged.

876
01:20:23.167 --> 01:20:24.625
I'm not.

877
01:20:27.292 --> 01:20:30.333
After what happened in the cave,
I understand.

878
01:20:38.208 --> 01:20:40.167
The Trojan didn't kill me.

879
01:20:41.083 --> 01:20:43.333
And it doesn't do anything
without a reason.

880
01:20:51.292 --> 01:20:52.833
It chose me!

881
01:20:54.583 --> 01:20:56.083
And I will help it.

882
01:20:57.667 --> 01:21:00.083
We weren't supposed to be here.

883
01:21:00.125 --> 01:21:01.375
We're a mistake!

884
01:21:02.333 --> 01:21:06.500
And you are the one who'd
helped me understand that.

885
01:21:14.750 --> 01:21:18.125
I realized that
we're all just like you, Steve!

886
01:21:18.167 --> 01:21:20.208
We weren't created right.

887
01:21:21.167 --> 01:21:24.000
We're a malfunction
of the Sphere!

888
01:21:26.875 --> 01:21:28.500
But I will fix it.

889
01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:32.333
David, wake up!

890
01:21:32.375 --> 01:21:34.625
You can't help Rita like that!

891
01:21:36.417 --> 01:21:38.625
She wouldn't be born
to suffer...

892
01:21:39.542 --> 01:21:42.000
and she will not die
at the age of eight.

893
01:21:42.958 --> 01:21:44.875
No one else will suffer,
Steve, because

894
01:21:44.917 --> 01:21:48.542
there will never be
any people to begin with!

895
01:21:58.167 --> 01:21:59.875
People deserve a chance,

896
01:22:00.375 --> 01:22:01.542
David.

897
01:22:02.333 --> 01:22:03.875
People don't change.

898
01:26:38.667 --> 01:26:40.167
Encounter to mission!

899
01:26:41.250 --> 01:26:42.750
Encounter to mission!

900
01:26:44.083 --> 01:26:45.583
Encounter to mission!

901
01:26:47.208 --> 01:26:48.917
Encounter to mission!

902
01:26:50.125 --> 01:26:51.875
Come in, mission.

903
01:26:53.167 --> 01:26:54.833
Come on, guys.

904
01:26:56.083 --> 01:26:57.208
Encounter to mission.

905
01:27:00.458 --> 01:27:02.083
<i>Encounter to mission!</i>

906
01:27:04.375 --> 01:27:05.875
<i>Encounter to mission!</i>

907
01:27:08.958 --> 01:27:10.625
<i>Encounter to mission!</i>

908
01:27:13.208 --> 01:27:14.583
<i>Encounter to mission!</i>

909
01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:18.583
Richard...

910
01:27:19.167 --> 01:27:21.292
Steve! Thank God.

911
01:27:21.875 --> 01:27:23.291
Saw the explosion on camera.

912
01:27:23.333 --> 01:27:26.000
- <i>I thought you were all...</i>
- The Trojan's been destroyed.

913
01:27:29.542 --> 01:27:30.583
What about Ryan?

914
01:27:30.958 --> 01:27:32.250
<i>He didn't make it.</i>

915
01:27:40.833 --> 01:27:41.917
<i>Steve...</i>

916
01:27:42.208 --> 01:27:44.458
<i>your oxygen levels are dropping.</i>

917
01:27:44.708 --> 01:27:47.417
Looks like some shrapnel
pierced the tank.

918
01:27:48.958 --> 01:27:50.500
How much time do I have?

919
01:27:50.542 --> 01:27:51.792
<i>About an hour.</i>

920
01:27:52.667 --> 01:27:54.083
<i>Look, I'll...</i>

921
01:27:54.125 --> 01:27:56.041
<i>I'll land a ship
and pick you up.</i>

922
01:27:56.083 --> 01:27:57.250
No.

923
01:27:57.292 --> 01:28:00.375
There's a storm here.
You'll crash.

924
01:28:01.583 --> 01:28:02.958
But what are you going to do?

925
01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:05.167
<i>I'm going into the cave.</i>

926
01:28:05.417 --> 01:28:07.250
I need to contact Amy.

927
01:28:07.792 --> 01:28:10.500
Land the ship as soon
as the storm settles down.

928
01:28:12.333 --> 01:28:14.042
Godspeed, Steve.

929
01:30:38.083 --> 01:30:40.167
Please start working.

930
01:30:57.333 --> 01:30:58.417
Steve!

931
01:31:05.083 --> 01:31:06.333
Amy?

932
01:31:15.583 --> 01:31:16.667
Steve!

933
01:31:18.583 --> 01:31:19.833
Where are you?

934
01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:22.000
I'm...

935
01:31:22.042 --> 01:31:23.583
somewhere in the distant past.

936
01:31:23.625 --> 01:31:24.625
What do you mean?

937
01:31:24.667 --> 01:31:26.458
We don't have much time.

938
01:31:27.167 --> 01:31:29.333
I know how to save the Earth.

939
01:31:29.917 --> 01:31:31.625
You were on the right path.

940
01:31:32.083 --> 01:31:34.333
There's a mechanism
that can help us

941
01:31:34.375 --> 01:31:35.833
create the vaccine.

942
01:31:36.333 --> 01:31:39.500
I saw it here with my own eyes.

943
01:31:40.042 --> 01:31:41.583
Can you write something down?

944
01:31:41.875 --> 01:31:43.833
S-sure. Sure.

945
01:31:47.375 --> 01:31:49.041
You have to teach...

946
01:31:49.083 --> 01:31:51.333
the plant cells
to quickly identify

947
01:31:51.375 --> 01:31:53.750
any mutation of the virus.

948
01:31:54.208 --> 01:31:56.250
Here's the antigen formula.

949
01:31:56.583 --> 01:31:59.417
Amy, I promised
I'd come back to see you.

950
01:32:00.083 --> 01:32:01.542
I'm so sorry.

951
01:32:04.667 --> 01:32:06.458
No, no, Steve.

952
01:32:06.583 --> 01:32:08.833
I only regret one thing.

953
01:32:12.292 --> 01:32:14.417
That I'll never
hold you again...

954
01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:18.458
and our child.

955
01:32:21.292 --> 01:32:23.250
We're connected, remember?

956
01:32:23.875 --> 01:32:25.833
You'll always be with me.

957
01:32:26.375 --> 01:32:27.917
With us.

958
01:32:41.750 --> 01:32:42.917
I love you.

959
01:32:43.458 --> 01:32:44.958
Both of you.

960
01:32:53.708 --> 01:32:57.000
I... love... you...

961
01:32:57.042 --> 01:32:58.250
Steve.

962
01:33:03.875 --> 01:33:05.250
Steve.

963
01:34:11.333 --> 01:34:15.708
<i>The Earth, O Lord,
is full of Thy Mercy.</i>

964
01:34:16.667 --> 01:34:18.542
<i>Teach me Thy statutes.</i>

965
01:34:19.458 --> 01:34:22.250
<i>Teach me good judgment
and knowledge.</i>

966
01:34:23.292 --> 01:34:26.583
<i>Before I was afflicted,
I went astray.</i>

967
01:34:27.292 --> 01:34:29.333
<i>But now I have kept Thy word.</i>

968
01:34:30.292 --> 01:34:34.125
<i>Thy hands have made me
and fashioned me.</i>

969
01:34:35.208 --> 01:34:38.875
<i>Let Thy tender mercies
come unto me,</i>

970
01:34:40.125 --> 01:34:42.833
<i>that I... may live.</i>
