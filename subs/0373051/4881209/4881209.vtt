1
00:01:08.154 --> 00:01:10.154
Trevor!

2
00:01:14.073 --> 00:01:14.927
Max.

3
00:01:46.154 --> 00:01:49.072
Although Wegener was ridiculed
by the scientific community...

4
00:01:49.903 --> 00:01:51.863
...he was eventually found
to be correct...

5
00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:55.112
...in his theory of an original
supercontinent called Pangaea.

6
00:01:55.987 --> 00:01:57.029
Yeah. Okay.

7
00:02:05.154 --> 00:02:06.237
Come to papa.

8
00:02:07.654 --> 00:02:08.654
Hey, Leonard.

9
00:02:09.903 --> 00:02:10.821
Hey, man.

10
00:02:12.154 --> 00:02:14.738
-Dude, you ain't gonna be happy.
-Why?

11
00:02:15.446 --> 00:02:17.322
-It's Kitzens.
-I see.

12
00:02:18.321 --> 00:02:21.397
-Hello.
-Trevor, there's my favorite colleague.

13
00:02:21.487 --> 00:02:22.779
-How are you, Alan?
-I'm good.

14
00:02:22.903 --> 00:02:24.481
How's that Con Drift class of yours going?

15
00:02:24.571 --> 00:02:25.481
Fine.

16
00:02:25.571 --> 00:02:28.155
Does it get echoey in there
with so few students?

17
00:02:30.029 --> 00:02:32.231
So, what do you got on the books?
I'm kind of busy around here.

18
00:02:32.321 --> 00:02:35.321
No, no, I can see how busy you are.

19
00:02:35.654 --> 00:02:38.405
So I'll try to be
as quick as possible here.

20
00:02:38.945 --> 00:02:42.070
The university is pulling the plug
on your brother's lab.

21
00:02:42.945 --> 00:02:43.813
Pulling the plug?

22
00:02:43.903 --> 00:02:46.612
Yeah, it's gonna finally give us
all the storage space we need.

23
00:02:46.903 --> 00:02:48.147
Let's get something straight here.

24
00:02:48.237 --> 00:02:52.147
This facility is dedicated to the research
of Maxwell Anderson's seminal theories...

25
00:02:52.237 --> 00:02:54.105
...predicting the volcanic fissures
in the mantle...

26
00:02:54.195 --> 00:02:55.813
Which have never been proven.

27
00:02:55.903 --> 00:03:00.064
I mean, how many of your late brother's
sensors are even still active?

28
00:03:00.154 --> 00:03:01.279
-One, two...?
-Three.

29
00:03:01.487 --> 00:03:02.481
It used to be 29.

30
00:03:02.571 --> 00:03:04.813
This is the wrong time to shut us down.

31
00:03:04.903 --> 00:03:06.897
I have got seismic activity in Bolivia.

32
00:03:06.987 --> 00:03:08.987
I got a 13 millimeter shift in Mongolia.

33
00:03:09.571 --> 00:03:12.030
Alan, you can't shut us down.
Keep the lab open.

34
00:03:12.321 --> 00:03:16.280
-It's all I've got left of Max.
-It's been 10 years since Max, Trevor.

35
00:03:17.446 --> 00:03:20.030
I am sorry about all this. I really am.

36
00:03:34.195 --> 00:03:36.821
<i>Trevor, are you there?
It's Elizabeth. Pick up, please.</i>

37
00:03:37.862 --> 00:03:41.321
<i>Okay. Well, we are on the 95,
and we're heading your way.</i>

38
00:03:42.404 --> 00:03:44.124
<i>You wanna say hi
to your Uncle Trevor, Sean?</i>

39
00:03:44.862 --> 00:03:45.780
<i>No.</i>

40
00:03:46.487 --> 00:03:47.980
<i>-Just say hello.</i>
-No.

41
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.029
<i>I don't want to.</i>

42
00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:50.571
Oh, no.

43
00:03:51.571 --> 00:03:53.155
<i>Hey, it's your sister-in-law again.</i>

44
00:03:53.487 --> 00:03:55.564
<i>Just wanted to make sure
what time you'd be home...</i>

45
00:03:55.654 --> 00:03:57.613
<i>...because we'll be there around 6.</i>

46
00:03:58.362 --> 00:04:00.445
<i>-Okay. Well, we'll be on my cell.</i>
-Oh, boy.

47
00:04:00.945 --> 00:04:02.688
<i>Sean's looking forward to seeing you.</i>

48
00:04:02.779 --> 00:04:03.813
<i>-Right, Sean?
-Negatory.</i>

49
00:04:03.903 --> 00:04:07.147
<i>I'm getting worried that we might've
gotten our signals crossed or something.</i>

50
00:04:07.237 --> 00:04:08.155
<i>Please call me.</i>

51
00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:10.599
<i>I'm not home. Leave me a message.</i>

52
00:04:10.987 --> 00:04:12.987
<i>Trevor, we're pulling up
in front of your building.</i>

53
00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:26.446
Trevor, you in there?

54
00:04:28.945 --> 00:04:29.863
Hi.

55
00:04:31.154 --> 00:04:32.072
Hey.

56
00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:34.105
-How are you, Elizabeth?
-Oh, you're home.

57
00:04:34.195 --> 00:04:35.779
-It's so good to see you.
-You too.

58
00:04:37.696 --> 00:04:40.238
How are you? I just got your messages.

59
00:04:41.195 --> 00:04:44.237
-You forgot, didn't you?
-I didn't forget.

60
00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:46.779
-How could I forget?
-You didn't forget?

61
00:04:46.987 --> 00:04:47.905
I...

62
00:04:50.404 --> 00:04:51.322
I forgot.

63
00:04:51.696 --> 00:04:53.064
It doesn't mean that I haven't
been looking forward...

64
00:04:53.154 --> 00:04:54.314
...to spending a little time
with my nephew.

65
00:04:54.404 --> 00:04:57.529
-I mean, haven't seen him since he was 9?
-Seven.

66
00:04:57.903 --> 00:04:58.821
Wow.

67
00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:02.988
-So how long is he gonna be staying again?
-Ten days.

68
00:05:03.654 --> 00:05:04.564
Is that what we said?

69
00:05:04.654 --> 00:05:07.280
Hey, Sean. How are you?

70
00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:09.447
Looking good.

71
00:05:10.738 --> 00:05:12.947
-Is that one of those Game Boys?
-It's a PSP.

72
00:05:13.321 --> 00:05:14.189
Cool.

73
00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:16.404
Sean, get up, say hi to your uncle.

74
00:05:19.446 --> 00:05:20.446
Hi to your uncle.

75
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.445
You know, last time I saw you,
you were about this high.

76
00:05:29.237 --> 00:05:30.155
Yeah, good one.

77
00:05:32.321 --> 00:05:33.197
Got that?

78
00:05:33.321 --> 00:05:34.813
Okay, you've got all my numbers.

79
00:05:34.903 --> 00:05:37.028
You've got your ticket
and your passport in your bag.

80
00:05:37.195 --> 00:05:39.314
I will be there to pick you up
at the airport in Ottawa.

81
00:05:39.404 --> 00:05:40.689
And by then I'll have found us a house...

82
00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:43.238
...and we can start
on this big new adventure.

83
00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:45.272
-Pretty exciting stuff, huh?
-Yeah, it's great.

84
00:05:45.362 --> 00:05:47.460
We get to be Canadians. Thrilling.

85
00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:51.612
Just let yourself in.

86
00:05:53.696 --> 00:05:56.714
-It will be good for him, being with you.
-Yeah.

87
00:05:57.321 --> 00:05:59.081
Who knows?
Maybe it will be good for you too.

88
00:06:04.321 --> 00:06:05.980
This is for you.

89
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:09.112
-What...? Is this Sean's?
-No, it's Max's.

90
00:06:09.654 --> 00:06:11.029
-Max's?
-Yeah.

91
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.356
So, hey, dude.
This is gonna be fun, you know?

92
00:06:32.446 --> 00:06:35.155
Just a couple of dudes hanging out.
Five days, maybe a week.

93
00:06:35.612 --> 00:06:38.488
You know, doing dude stuff,
what dudes do.

94
00:06:39.237 --> 00:06:40.155
You like baseball?

95
00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:42.959
Hey, you know what we should do?
We should go get in a batting cage.

96
00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:47.071
Yeah, okay, listen.
I don't like this any more than you do.

97
00:06:47.321 --> 00:06:49.397
So as long as you keep the fridge stocked
with Mountain Dew...

98
00:06:49.487 --> 00:06:51.405
...and TiVo "Family Guy,"
we'll get along fine.

99
00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.237
-Sure.
-Oh, wow.

100
00:06:55.571 --> 00:06:56.988
That's an awesome coin collection.

101
00:06:57.903 --> 00:07:01.272
Well, kind of a pet project of mine.

102
00:07:01.362 --> 00:07:02.445
Yeah, it's really nifty.

103
00:07:03.903 --> 00:07:04.863
Thanks.

104
00:07:05.779 --> 00:07:08.029
You hungry? We could order in, you know.

105
00:07:08.154 --> 00:07:11.529
Maybe some pizza, Chinese, Thai food?

106
00:07:11.945 --> 00:07:13.362
Subs? Or something like that?

107
00:07:16.154 --> 00:07:17.529
-Wow.
-What's that?

108
00:07:18.738 --> 00:07:24.988
Well, it's a box of possessions
of a really great guy.

109
00:07:25.404 --> 00:07:26.322
Your dad.

110
00:07:29.654 --> 00:07:30.737
His old ball glove.

111
00:07:33.237 --> 00:07:34.904
Mom doesn't talk about him very much.

112
00:07:35.321 --> 00:07:36.682
Well, you can take my word for it.

113
00:07:36.945 --> 00:07:39.439
He was one of those few people...

114
00:07:39.529 --> 00:07:43.738
...who are just exceptional
at everything they do.

115
00:07:47.279 --> 00:07:48.197
You see this?

116
00:07:48.612 --> 00:07:50.904
This was your old man's PSP.

117
00:07:51.903 --> 00:07:54.105
-A yo-yo?
-Don't be dissing the yo-yo.

118
00:07:54.195 --> 00:07:56.272
This is physics at work right here.
You got your centrifugal force,

119
00:07:56.362 --> 00:07:59.196
your gravitational pull,
you got your potential energy.

120
00:07:59.446 --> 00:08:01.113
And in ancient times, did you know...

121
00:08:01.321 --> 00:08:04.613
...that this was actually used
as a hunting implement?

122
00:08:04.889 --> 00:08:05.807
Watch.

123
00:08:09.529 --> 00:08:11.850
-Hey, here, let me try.
-Yeah, you should probably take it.

124
00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.112
I have no idea what this is.

125
00:08:24.779 --> 00:08:25.697
Hello.

126
00:08:28.529 --> 00:08:29.609
This was his favorite book.

127
00:08:30.362 --> 00:08:33.613
"Jules Verne's
A Journey to the Center of the Earth."

128
00:08:36.571 --> 00:08:38.852
You know, I think that was
on my summer reading list once.

129
00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:42.779
-I never got to it.
-That's too bad, it's a good read.

130
00:08:43.779 --> 00:08:48.405
To him, it wasn't just science fiction,
it was inspiration.

131
00:08:49.237 --> 00:08:51.696
He used to read this to me
when I was a really little kid.

132
00:08:54.903 --> 00:08:57.195
Hello. What are these notes?

133
00:09:04.279 --> 00:09:09.279
"Magma temperatures reach 1150
in Mongolia"?

134
00:09:11.195 --> 00:09:12.113
"Bolivia."

135
00:09:13.571 --> 00:09:14.489
"Hawaii."

136
00:09:17.779 --> 00:09:18.697
Look out!

137
00:09:26.696 --> 00:09:29.113
Hey, Sean, let's go check out my lab.

138
00:09:30.195 --> 00:09:31.696
So it couldn't wait for tomorrow?

139
00:09:32.029 --> 00:09:33.196
Your dad used to say,

140
00:09:33.321 --> 00:09:36.356
"Tectonophysics is the science of now,
not tomorrow."

141
00:09:36.446 --> 00:09:38.738
It's about seismic events
that occur in an instant.

142
00:09:39.237 --> 00:09:40.155
Here, look at this.

143
00:09:41.987 --> 00:09:45.404
You got Hawaii, Bolivia, Mongolia.

144
00:09:45.738 --> 00:09:48.863
And the conditions today are almost
exactly what they were in July '97.

145
00:09:49.237 --> 00:09:51.155
What's the big deal about July '97?

146
00:09:51.612 --> 00:09:53.612
Sean, that was the year
that your dad went missing.

147
00:09:54.612 --> 00:09:57.029
Now, look, you see
this column of numbers here?

148
00:09:58.404 --> 00:10:01.696
If the 753, right here, was a 752,
then it would be...

149
00:10:10.654 --> 00:10:11.737
...exactly the same.

150
00:10:13.779 --> 00:10:16.488
What do these little blips mean?

151
00:10:16.903 --> 00:10:19.320
Don't touch anything.
Those little blips are my life's work.

152
00:10:20.487 --> 00:10:22.570
These four little blips
are your entire life's work?

153
00:10:23.154 --> 00:10:24.237
Three. Three little blips.

154
00:10:27.487 --> 00:10:31.348
One, two, three, four.

155
00:10:36.696 --> 00:10:37.614
Iceland.

156
00:10:38.404 --> 00:10:39.322
This makes sense.

157
00:10:39.779 --> 00:10:42.571
Max saw the readings 10 years ago,
and he took off to investigate.

158
00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:45.571
Now, if the readings are the same today
as they were then...

159
00:10:46.903 --> 00:10:49.103
...this may be my only chance
to find out what happened.

160
00:10:49.195 --> 00:10:51.404
-I'm gonna need your passport.
-For what?

161
00:10:51.779 --> 00:10:54.619
I'm sorry, I have to get you to Canada
a little earlier than we planned.

162
00:10:55.029 --> 00:10:56.112
What are you talking about?

163
00:10:57.112 --> 00:11:00.738
I'm talking about this.
A Journey to the Center of the Earth.

164
00:11:02.987 --> 00:11:06.362
It's all set in Iceland,
which is where he must've gone.

165
00:11:08.195 --> 00:11:09.571
These are all my dad's notes?

166
00:11:12.862 --> 00:11:13.780
Look...

167
00:11:17.862 --> 00:11:18.780
...Max and I...

168
00:11:19.362 --> 00:11:24.113
Your dad and I were talking about the
possibility of volcanic tubes existing...

169
00:11:24.529 --> 00:11:28.113
...that went down past the mantle,
towards the center of the Earth.

170
00:11:28.321 --> 00:11:30.155
And that's what I think
he went looking for.

171
00:11:31.195 --> 00:11:33.876
I'm sorry, but I gotta put you
on a flight to Ottawa in the morning.

172
00:11:34.029 --> 00:11:35.947
-And I'm calling Icelandair.
-No, no, look.

173
00:11:37.696 --> 00:11:39.155
-Hey.
-I just got here, okay?

174
00:11:39.246 --> 00:11:40.600
You're not gonna go and ditch me.

175
00:11:40.738 --> 00:11:43.055
Besides I was the person
who found your life's work...

176
00:11:43.146 --> 00:11:45.149
...fourth little blip thingy
in the first place.

177
00:11:45.738 --> 00:11:46.730
This is my brother
we're talking about here.

178
00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:47.738
Well, it's my dad.

179
00:11:48.404 --> 00:11:51.113
Now, I don't have to be in Ottawa
for 10 days. I'm going with you.

180
00:11:51.487 --> 00:11:54.288
Do you know how much it cost
to book a last-minute flight to Reykjavik?

181
00:11:54.446 --> 00:11:55.967
Something tells me you got it covered.

182
00:12:09.779 --> 00:12:13.405
"Descend bold traveler
into the crater of the jokul of Sneffels,"

183
00:12:13.654 --> 00:12:17.071
"which the shadow of Scartaris touches
before the kalends of July..."

184
00:12:17.321 --> 00:12:19.363
"...and you will attain
the center of the Earth."

185
00:12:21.779 --> 00:12:22.697
Sorry.

186
00:12:25.612 --> 00:12:28.154
P-B... P-B, and...

187
00:12:28.279 --> 00:12:29.197
What are you doing?

188
00:12:29.362 --> 00:12:32.779
I'm deciphering these notations
that your father made in this book.

189
00:12:32.903 --> 00:12:35.813
I think there's a code
behind the pairing of letters.

190
00:12:35.903 --> 00:12:37.939
I think it might have something to do
with the periodic table.

191
00:12:38.029 --> 00:12:40.238
For instance, I've got S-A, I-S, G-G.

192
00:12:40.738 --> 00:12:44.772
I believe that P-B is
on the periodic table and that's plumbum.

193
00:12:44.862 --> 00:12:48.862
-Plumbum means lead.
-What's "Sigurbjorn Asgeirsson"?

194
00:12:49.237 --> 00:12:50.155
What?

195
00:12:51.112 --> 00:12:53.946
Well, it's right here. Read it down.
Sigurbjorn Asgeirsson.

196
00:12:57.605 --> 00:12:59.351
Sigurbjorn Asgeirsson, that's...

197
00:13:02.279 --> 00:13:04.321
That's a clue. Maybe that's a place.

198
00:13:04.446 --> 00:13:06.113
It could be a thing.

199
00:13:06.654 --> 00:13:09.272
-What are you doing?
-I am Googling at 30,000 feet.

200
00:13:09.363 --> 00:13:12.197
-Are you supposed to be doing that?
-Welcome to the 21 st century.

201
00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:15.363
-Okay. Here.
-It's a person.

202
00:13:15.738 --> 00:13:17.564
"Sigurbjorn Asgeirsson,
executive director...

203
00:13:17.654 --> 00:13:20.363
...of �sgeirsson Institute
for Progressive Volcanology."

204
00:13:20.529 --> 00:13:21.779
Max would've known this guy.

205
00:13:22.195 --> 00:13:23.987
I knew it was a good thing
to bring you, kid.

206
00:13:24.321 --> 00:13:26.113
His institute has gotta be our first stop.

207
00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:33.738
Are we there yet?

208
00:13:34.154 --> 00:13:36.529
If you mean annoying, yeah, we're there.

209
00:13:37.945 --> 00:13:40.385
-You know, you're going kind of slow.
-I'm going kind of safe.

210
00:13:41.029 --> 00:13:42.550
I just saw a goat in the passing lane.

211
00:13:43.738 --> 00:13:45.689
When's the whole adventure thing
gonna begin?

212
00:13:45.779 --> 00:13:47.446
Let me give you something fun to do.

213
00:13:48.446 --> 00:13:49.364
Navigate.

214
00:13:51.154 --> 00:13:52.072
Where are we?

215
00:13:53.154 --> 00:13:57.571
Have we passed Havanschlicht?

216
00:13:58.404 --> 00:13:59.863
-Havanschlicht?
-Yeah.

217
00:14:00.779 --> 00:14:01.821
I don't know.

218
00:14:03.321 --> 00:14:05.855
-Have we passed Eingarsstadir?
-I don't know.

219
00:14:05.945 --> 00:14:07.863
-Reyniv�r?
-I don't know.

220
00:14:07.987 --> 00:14:09.105
-H�savik?
-No.

221
00:14:09.195 --> 00:14:10.654
-Grundarhol?
-No.

222
00:14:10.945 --> 00:14:13.980
-Stifflarschtarder?
-Stifflardschtarder?

223
00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:17.571
-How about Koldukardarskinoquue?
-What?

224
00:14:19.362 --> 00:14:21.404
-We're definitely lost.
-We're not lost.

225
00:14:21.862 --> 00:14:24.439
-Just look for an institution.
-What's an institution look like?

226
00:14:24.529 --> 00:14:28.030
I don't know,
it looks big and institutional.

227
00:14:28.154 --> 00:14:29.595
It's gotta be around here somewhere.

228
00:14:31.903 --> 00:14:32.897
Hey, look.
There's a little shack up there.

229
00:14:32.987 --> 00:14:34.827
Maybe we can stop there
and ask for directions.

230
00:14:37.696 --> 00:14:40.447
-We're not lost.
-Oh, no, definitely not.

231
00:14:44.029 --> 00:14:45.655
What's this? A ski shack?

232
00:14:47.487 --> 00:14:50.154
"�sgeirsson...

233
00:14:50.279 --> 00:14:53.279
...Institute for Progressive Volcanology."
I told you I'd find it.

234
00:14:53.738 --> 00:14:54.821
All righty.

235
00:14:55.529 --> 00:14:58.238
-Not too shabby.
-All right.

236
00:15:01.903 --> 00:15:04.695
Oh, I'm sorry, I don't speak Icelandic.

237
00:15:09.321 --> 00:15:11.738
-Hi, can I help you?
-Hello.

238
00:15:13.571 --> 00:15:15.571
-I'm Hannah.
-Oh, how do you do? Hi.

239
00:15:15.696 --> 00:15:19.238
I'm Trev... Professor Anderson.
I'm visiting from America.

240
00:15:21.321 --> 00:15:24.072
-This is Sean, my nephew.
-I'm Sean.

241
00:15:24.738 --> 00:15:25.614
Hi, Sean.

242
00:15:26.529 --> 00:15:29.730
I was wondering if I could
possibly speak with, forgive me here,

243
00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:31.820
it's Sigurbj�rn �sgeirsson?

244
00:15:34.404 --> 00:15:36.487
Well, Sigurbj�rn �sgeirsson is dead.

245
00:15:37.321 --> 00:15:39.780
-Dead?
-Yeah, he died three winters ago.

246
00:15:41.487 --> 00:15:45.196
-So do you run the institute?
-Nobody does. There is no institute.

247
00:15:45.321 --> 00:15:46.897
There's a sign down the road that says...

248
00:15:46.987 --> 00:15:49.897
Progressive volcanology was a failed idea.

249
00:15:49.987 --> 00:15:53.613
Like, you know, the Berlin Wall
and eight-track tapes.

250
00:15:54.112 --> 00:15:55.030
I see.

251
00:15:56.321 --> 00:15:59.321
-Well, did you work with him?
-No, no. He was my father.

252
00:16:04.362 --> 00:16:06.696
Yeah? I know it. What about it?

253
00:16:07.195 --> 00:16:10.737
Well, this book belonged
to my late brother, Max.

254
00:16:10.945 --> 00:16:11.863
Max Anderson?

255
00:16:12.237 --> 00:16:16.654
We believe that he may have been
in contact with your father.

256
00:16:17.195 --> 00:16:18.320
Your brother was a Vernian.

257
00:16:19.195 --> 00:16:20.113
What's a Vernian?

258
00:16:20.237 --> 00:16:23.946
Someone that believes that the writings
of Jules Verne were actual fact.

259
00:16:24.612 --> 00:16:27.113
I mean, the guy
was a science fiction writer.

260
00:16:27.529 --> 00:16:31.238
And yet this society of believers
regarded Verne like a visionary.

261
00:16:31.446 --> 00:16:33.405
My father was
the biggest Vernian of them all.

262
00:16:34.321 --> 00:16:35.905
My brother was no Vernian.

263
00:16:45.404 --> 00:16:46.571
This was my father's copy.

264
00:16:48.237 --> 00:16:49.155
Take a look.

265
00:16:52.779 --> 00:16:54.571
See, the markings are exactly the same.

266
00:16:55.654 --> 00:16:56.779
Your brother was a Vernian.

267
00:16:59.446 --> 00:17:03.231
Wow, my dad was kind of out there.

268
00:17:03.321 --> 00:17:06.446
-You didn't know him, Sean.
-I'm starting to think you didn't either.

269
00:17:06.654 --> 00:17:09.155
He was no member of some secret society.

270
00:17:10.112 --> 00:17:11.321
What are you guys doing here?

271
00:17:11.529 --> 00:17:13.571
I'm a scientist, I'm a professor.

272
00:17:13.903 --> 00:17:15.772
I'm here
because there are seismic sensors...

273
00:17:15.862 --> 00:17:17.529
...going off 30 klicks north of here...

274
00:17:17.696 --> 00:17:19.689
...that we think
that we should check into.

275
00:17:19.779 --> 00:17:21.979
And that's the reason that we're here,
plain and simple.

276
00:17:23.446 --> 00:17:24.446
Okay.

277
00:17:25.070 --> 00:17:27.153
You know,
there are no roads to the north.

278
00:17:27.612 --> 00:17:28.530
Well...

279
00:17:29.051 --> 00:17:31.988
I'm a mountain guide.
I can take you there, professor.

280
00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:34.231
-Great.
-That's great, I love hiking.

281
00:17:34.321 --> 00:17:36.241
-I would appreciate that. That'd be great.
-Good.

282
00:17:38.321 --> 00:17:40.696
-Call me Trevor.
-You can call me Sean.

283
00:17:41.112 --> 00:17:42.988
So it will be 5000 kronur to go up there.

284
00:17:43.321 --> 00:17:46.738
-Five grand a day? No problem.
-An hour.

285
00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:50.738
Do you accept rolls of quarters?

286
00:18:19.321 --> 00:18:22.030
Come on, boys.
I wanna be home by sundown.

287
00:18:24.738 --> 00:18:27.614
Hey, you think you can slow down
a little bit, please?

288
00:18:35.237 --> 00:18:36.279
-Dibs.
-What?

289
00:18:37.404 --> 00:18:38.724
I got dibs on the mountain guide.

290
00:18:42.571 --> 00:18:43.489
You're 13.

291
00:18:44.321 --> 00:18:47.113
-Sorry, called it.
-Thirteen-year-olds don't get dibs.

292
00:18:47.446 --> 00:18:48.364
Get over it.

293
00:18:58.404 --> 00:18:59.487
We're getting closer.

294
00:19:00.279 --> 00:19:03.730
All right, just watch your step there.
Mount Sneffels is deceptively treacherous.

295
00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:06.945
-What's Sneffels?
-Well, why don't you tell him, professor?

296
00:19:07.237 --> 00:19:11.029
Sneffels is the name of the mountain
where this character Liedenbrock...

297
00:19:12.029 --> 00:19:15.029
...apparently found a portal
to the center of the Earth.

298
00:19:15.945 --> 00:19:17.825
Let's just find that sensor of yours,
professor.

299
00:19:18.696 --> 00:19:19.614
There it is.

300
00:19:21.571 --> 00:19:22.489
Yes.

301
00:19:22.987 --> 00:19:24.529
Well, what do you need to do with it?

302
00:19:25.362 --> 00:19:27.779
I gotta unlock it.
It's got, like, a black box...

303
00:19:28.529 --> 00:19:32.779
...that has recorded
all of the seismic activity...

304
00:19:32.903 --> 00:19:34.612
...that's transpired in the last 10 years.

305
00:19:34.987 --> 00:19:36.279
Could tell me a lot about Max.

306
00:19:37.112 --> 00:19:39.237
And what he was doing
when he went missing.

307
00:19:39.399 --> 00:19:41.527
Trevor, I'm really sorry,
we're gonna have to go now.

308
00:19:42.321 --> 00:19:43.363
Must be corroded.

309
00:19:44.195 --> 00:19:45.445
Trevor, we need to...

310
00:19:50.571 --> 00:19:52.522
-Okay, we need to take cover.
-I'm almost done.

311
00:19:52.612 --> 00:19:55.196
-Come on, come on, Sean. Right now.
-I'll be right there.

312
00:19:55.321 --> 00:19:57.362
-Trevor, just leave it for now.
-I've almost got it.

313
00:19:59.154 --> 00:20:00.237
We need to take cover now.

314
00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:04.862
Come on. Trevor.

315
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:06.571
-Uncle Trevor.
-Get in here.

316
00:20:07.571 --> 00:20:08.489
Yes.

317
00:20:09.696 --> 00:20:10.606
Watch out!

318
00:20:10.696 --> 00:20:12.280
You have to hurry up! Come on!

319
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:16.231
Trevor, the sensor's
attracting the lightning.

320
00:20:16.321 --> 00:20:19.446
-Drop it. Drop the sensor.
-What? I'm not gonna drop it.

321
00:20:19.945 --> 00:20:22.446
-Hurry!
-It's attracting the lightning!

322
00:20:40.612 --> 00:20:41.530
Trevor?

323
00:20:43.903 --> 00:20:45.737
-Trevor?
-I'm all right.

324
00:20:50.112 --> 00:20:51.030
Sean?

325
00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:55.321
-Sean, you all right?
-I'm good.

326
00:21:01.362 --> 00:21:02.979
Okay, everybody, just stay calm.

327
00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:05.320
Guys, come on, you gotta help me dig.

328
00:21:07.279 --> 00:21:08.197
Come on.

329
00:21:14.987 --> 00:21:17.654
-Forget it, it's no use.
-Forget it?

330
00:21:20.738 --> 00:21:21.614
She's right.

331
00:21:21.903 --> 00:21:27.320
There must be about 60 or 70 tons
of boulders on top of us.

332
00:21:27.654 --> 00:21:29.295
Take us about a month to dig out of here.

333
00:21:31.987 --> 00:21:34.571
-We have to find another way.
-What if there is no other way?

334
00:21:34.696 --> 00:21:36.071
There's always another way, Sean.

335
00:21:39.321 --> 00:21:40.321
What else have you got?

336
00:21:40.779 --> 00:21:44.022
Signal flares, first aid,
some rope, blankets...

337
00:21:44.112 --> 00:21:45.571
...and a couple of protein bars.

338
00:21:45.987 --> 00:21:48.481
But they're on a ration. We don't know
how long we'll be trapped for.

339
00:21:48.571 --> 00:21:51.113
Trapped? Is that what we are?

340
00:21:52.571 --> 00:21:55.571
That... She... No, she didn't mean that.

341
00:21:56.738 --> 00:21:59.947
-Sean, hey, what are you doing?
-God, I'm not getting any service.

342
00:22:00.321 --> 00:22:02.442
Sean, you're not gonna get any signal
down here, okay?

343
00:22:03.029 --> 00:22:05.112
Put this away. Okay, don't worry about it.

344
00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:08.195
-We'll find another way out, all right?
-Okay.

345
00:22:10.446 --> 00:22:12.364
One of these might snake
back to the surface.

346
00:22:12.571 --> 00:22:14.113
How do we know which one to take?

347
00:22:15.195 --> 00:22:16.570
My gut says we go right.

348
00:22:18.654 --> 00:22:20.488
Come on. Come on.

349
00:22:23.362 --> 00:22:25.571
Looks promising.

350
00:22:31.487 --> 00:22:34.487
Just put one foot in front of the other.
We'll be out of here in no time.

351
00:22:37.237 --> 00:22:38.529
Looking good.

352
00:22:41.738 --> 00:22:45.197
Don't worry, direction is my sixth sense.

353
00:22:46.321 --> 00:22:48.947
Pay attention, Sean.
It's just like doing field work.

354
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:53.112
-I used to love doing field work.
-Watch out!

355
00:23:08.237 --> 00:23:10.529
You're not studying rocks in a lab,
professor.

356
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:14.112
-This is life or death here.
-Yeah, thanks.

357
00:23:15.321 --> 00:23:16.239
You owe me one.

358
00:23:31.446 --> 00:23:32.446
What does this say?

359
00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.688
That means keep out.

360
00:23:37.779 --> 00:23:41.154
-Maybe that's decent advice.
-No, no. This is great news.

361
00:23:41.321 --> 00:23:44.613
This might lead us to an old mine shaft
and that could be our way out of here.

362
00:23:44.738 --> 00:23:47.378
-How deep do you think it is?
-Can you give me one of those flares?

363
00:23:47.945 --> 00:23:50.904
Thank you. Sean, look at your watch.

364
00:23:51.321 --> 00:23:53.446
I'm gonna light this
and drop it over the edge...

365
00:23:53.903 --> 00:23:56.945
...and I want you to tell me
how many seconds pass before it stops.

366
00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:57.988
Okay.

367
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:03.696
Here we go. Three, two...

368
00:24:04.987 --> 00:24:05.987
Oh, God!

369
00:24:13.779 --> 00:24:15.904
What? What was that?

370
00:24:26.738 --> 00:24:28.656
Yup, magnesium.

371
00:24:29.154 --> 00:24:31.279
Must run in veins
all through these walls.

372
00:24:31.945 --> 00:24:34.696
Magnesium is kind of flammable,
isn't it, professor?

373
00:24:35.279 --> 00:24:38.689
Yeah, used in flares,
used in gun powder, matchsticks.

374
00:24:38.779 --> 00:24:43.071
Right, well, maybe gun powders and flares
aren't such a good idea down here.

375
00:24:47.154 --> 00:24:48.072
Thank you.

376
00:24:48.903 --> 00:24:49.864
It's the same principle.

377
00:24:51.321 --> 00:24:53.571
-You ready, Sean?
-Yeah, go ahead.

378
00:24:54.529 --> 00:24:55.988
Three, two...

379
00:24:58.404 --> 00:24:59.322
One.

380
00:25:01.362 --> 00:25:02.280
Two.

381
00:25:03.321 --> 00:25:04.239
Almost three.

382
00:25:05.945 --> 00:25:08.654
Thirty-two squared by... It's 200 feet.

383
00:25:09.696 --> 00:25:10.614
That's no problem.

384
00:25:11.279 --> 00:25:14.613
It's about your basic 20-story high-rise.

385
00:25:14.738 --> 00:25:16.738
-You got enough rope?
-I always have enough rope.

386
00:25:17.529 --> 00:25:20.904
-Well, no problem for what?
-Rappelling down in there.

387
00:25:21.571 --> 00:25:23.571
We're gonna rappel down
that deep, dark hole?

388
00:25:23.903 --> 00:25:27.153
What, you got a problem with that?
What's the matter?

389
00:25:27.404 --> 00:25:29.356
There's no way we should be
rappelling down that hole.

390
00:25:29.446 --> 00:25:30.527
What are you talking about?

391
00:25:30.738 --> 00:25:32.730
What, you're man enough to call dibs
on the mountain guide,

392
00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:34.648
but you're not man enough
to climb down a little piece of rope...

393
00:25:34.738 --> 00:25:36.064
-Guys. Guys.
-Calling dibs on the mountain guide...

394
00:25:36.154 --> 00:25:38.030
No one gets dibs on the mountain guide.

395
00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:41.741
We're going down there.

396
00:25:45.487 --> 00:25:47.071
Steady, steady.

397
00:25:48.862 --> 00:25:50.237
Remember, we're all connected.

398
00:25:52.404 --> 00:25:53.322
It's okay.

399
00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:56.988
Looking good.

400
00:25:59.696 --> 00:26:00.657
It's all good down here.

401
00:26:02.279 --> 00:26:03.279
Way down here.

402
00:26:04.112 --> 00:26:05.481
You guys are coming down, right?

403
00:26:05.571 --> 00:26:08.780
All right, Sean, I'm gonna start
lowering you down really, really slowly.

404
00:26:08.987 --> 00:26:11.987
So just lean back
and keep your feet up high.

405
00:26:15.195 --> 00:26:16.113
You're okay, Sean.

406
00:26:16.529 --> 00:26:18.730
We're tethered together,
so nothing bad is gonna happen.

407
00:26:20.362 --> 00:26:21.362
Yeah, sure.

408
00:26:22.987 --> 00:26:23.905
Good.

409
00:26:28.779 --> 00:26:31.446
Sean, just keep walking.
You have to keep walking.

410
00:26:34.279 --> 00:26:35.197
Good.

411
00:26:38.112 --> 00:26:39.481
Hey, you're looking
pretty good there, Sean.

412
00:26:39.571 --> 00:26:41.447
-Sure you haven't done this before?
-Shut up.

413
00:26:43.446 --> 00:26:45.481
Hey, you mind? Watch your step, will you?

414
00:26:45.571 --> 00:26:46.852
I'm hanging on for my life here.

415
00:26:48.571 --> 00:26:50.780
Okay. Sean, just make conversation
with me.

416
00:26:52.237 --> 00:26:54.571
So, Hannah, do you come here often?

417
00:26:55.154 --> 00:26:56.022
Oh, give me a break.

418
00:26:56.112 --> 00:26:58.033
That can't be the best line
you can come up with.

419
00:26:58.654 --> 00:27:01.821
-I'm making conversation with her.
-No, Sean, I do not come here very often.

420
00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:04.738
Ready?

421
00:27:13.487 --> 00:27:15.779
Hey. Look at all this schist.

422
00:27:16.987 --> 00:27:18.654
-What?
-It's a metamorphic rock.

423
00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:21.571
Green schist, garnet schist,
mica-garnet schist.

424
00:27:22.738 --> 00:27:23.648
Schist.

425
00:27:23.738 --> 00:27:25.299
It's everywhere, look at it. I guess...

426
00:27:27.571 --> 00:27:28.489
Trevor.

427
00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:37.154
Get to the wall, Trevor.

428
00:27:37.404 --> 00:27:39.779
I can't. I can't,
the walls widen out down here.

429
00:27:40.154 --> 00:27:41.613
Trevor, your rope is caught on mine.

430
00:27:41.779 --> 00:27:43.855
You're gonna take us all down.
I'm gonna have to cut you loose.

431
00:27:43.945 --> 00:27:45.320
-What?
-Hannah, no.

432
00:27:45.487 --> 00:27:48.113
-Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait.
-Don't.

433
00:27:48.237 --> 00:27:49.638
-Don't, don't, don't.
-Uncle Trevor.

434
00:27:58.738 --> 00:28:02.239
Hey, guys, found it.
The bottom's right here.

435
00:28:03.195 --> 00:28:06.195
Hey, Hannah, you knew that, right?

436
00:28:07.696 --> 00:28:09.946
Right? Hannah?

437
00:28:19.696 --> 00:28:21.614
Guys, what's this?

438
00:28:27.195 --> 00:28:28.862
Looks like an abandoned mine tunnel
to me.

439
00:28:29.195 --> 00:28:30.445
That's Old Bla'gils Mine.

440
00:28:32.321 --> 00:28:34.488
It was shut down 60 years ago
after the big disaster.

441
00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:35.738
Disaster?

442
00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:37.738
How big?

443
00:28:38.696 --> 00:28:41.155
-Eighty-one dead.
-That's pretty big.

444
00:28:42.571 --> 00:28:44.821
Come on. Cowboy up.

445
00:28:47.487 --> 00:28:49.946
Hey, Trevor, was there a mine like this
in the book?

446
00:28:50.654 --> 00:28:51.904
No, don't think so.

447
00:28:54.862 --> 00:28:56.071
-Hannah?
-Yup?

448
00:28:56.654 --> 00:28:57.779
Can I ask you something?

449
00:28:58.696 --> 00:29:02.564
Do you wonder
if your father and my brother...

450
00:29:03.978 --> 00:29:05.185
weren't wrong?

451
00:29:06.112 --> 00:29:07.779
Let me make something very clear to you.

452
00:29:09.487 --> 00:29:10.779
I am not my father.

453
00:29:11.487 --> 00:29:14.529
And the world that he belonged to
has nothing to do with me.

454
00:29:15.154 --> 00:29:16.237
I understand, of course.

455
00:29:16.404 --> 00:29:19.030
I didn't mean to say that it was
or that, you know, it would be...

456
00:29:19.154 --> 00:29:22.030
-You know I'm still on the clock, right?
-You're still billing me?

457
00:29:23.195 --> 00:29:25.862
I bill you until I'm safe in my house.

458
00:29:29.903 --> 00:29:30.821
Hannah?

459
00:29:35.903 --> 00:29:36.821
What's that?

460
00:29:38.029 --> 00:29:41.029
-This is the old generator for the mine.
-Hey, you don't want to touch that.

461
00:29:43.154 --> 00:29:44.147
What are you doing?

462
00:29:44.237 --> 00:29:46.529
There might be some
volatile compounds there, you know.

463
00:29:46.862 --> 00:29:48.071
Serious generator.

464
00:29:49.154 --> 00:29:51.395
Hannah, that thing could blow up.
Stop throwing switches.

465
00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:53.780
Don't do that. No, wait.
Get away from that thing.

466
00:30:03.571 --> 00:30:04.988
Okay, I take it back.

467
00:30:11.779 --> 00:30:15.231
This is it, right? I mean, the miners,
they had to get their stuff out somewhere.

468
00:30:15.321 --> 00:30:17.030
-Yeah.
-These tracks could lead us out.

469
00:30:17.987 --> 00:30:19.467
Hey, Hannah, how many miners got out?

470
00:30:21.404 --> 00:30:22.322
One.

471
00:30:23.321 --> 00:30:24.738
That's a start. I call front.

472
00:30:26.154 --> 00:30:28.813
What? No, no, no.
Come on, Sean, don't get in there.

473
00:30:28.903 --> 00:30:31.737
We don't even know if these things work.
They're not safe.

474
00:30:32.154 --> 00:30:33.613
The tracks might not be safe.

475
00:30:38.529 --> 00:30:39.889
Track ahead looks good.

476
00:30:40.431 --> 00:30:41.297
Get in.

477
00:30:52.446 --> 00:30:55.072
Hey, Sean, it doesn't look safe.
I wouldn't do that.

478
00:30:55.195 --> 00:30:57.071
I think I see something. It's...

479
00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:01.404
Please tell me it's daylight.
Otherwise, I don't wanna know.

480
00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:07.945
No, it's not daylight.
Oh, we're in deep schist.

481
00:31:17.154 --> 00:31:18.863
I wish there were seat belts
on this thing.

482
00:31:19.279 --> 00:31:20.780
You're worried about seat belts?

483
00:31:33.237 --> 00:31:34.155
Watch it.

484
00:31:45.612 --> 00:31:48.029
-Hannah.
-I know.

485
00:31:48.154 --> 00:31:50.363
-Pull the brake, pull the brake.
-No, don't.

486
00:31:50.738 --> 00:31:51.738
We won't make it.

487
00:32:03.487 --> 00:32:04.405
Yeah.

488
00:32:06.321 --> 00:32:08.488
Hey, great job. Thanks.

489
00:32:10.279 --> 00:32:12.113
-Guys.
-Stay put, Sean.

490
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:24.780
Trevor, you okay?

491
00:32:25.321 --> 00:32:28.947
Hannah, your track ends.

492
00:32:30.237 --> 00:32:31.320
Jump in my car.

493
00:32:32.154 --> 00:32:33.072
What?

494
00:32:33.571 --> 00:32:35.654
Quick, you have to do it.

495
00:32:35.987 --> 00:32:37.070
Just jump.

496
00:32:40.487 --> 00:32:41.405
Ready?

497
00:32:47.903 --> 00:32:50.278
Trevor, your track ends too.

498
00:32:54.862 --> 00:32:56.945
-Okay.
-What are you doing?

499
00:32:57.571 --> 00:32:59.613
Showing the proper way
to save someone's life.

500
00:32:59.738 --> 00:33:00.738
-Come on.
-Can I help?

501
00:33:01.195 --> 00:33:02.113
Okay.

502
00:33:05.862 --> 00:33:06.780
Ready?

503
00:33:21.987 --> 00:33:23.446
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

504
00:33:24.195 --> 00:33:25.570
Luckily, I had a soft landing.

505
00:33:30.154 --> 00:33:31.529
That's two you owe me now.

506
00:33:32.987 --> 00:33:36.070
-Who's keeping count?
-I am.

507
00:33:39.862 --> 00:33:44.363
That was awesome.

508
00:33:45.779 --> 00:33:47.738
-What happened to you, guys?
-Don't ask.

509
00:33:53.779 --> 00:33:54.697
What's that?

510
00:33:58.195 --> 00:33:59.755
Where are you going? Don't go in there.

511
00:33:59.862 --> 00:34:02.182
What are you guys talking about?
This could be our way out.

512
00:34:05.112 --> 00:34:06.446
There's a hole in the wall.

513
00:34:07.321 --> 00:34:08.321
Guys, check it out.

514
00:34:13.612 --> 00:34:15.904
-Rubies.
-Emeralds.

515
00:34:17.112 --> 00:34:18.030
Feldspar.

516
00:34:18.987 --> 00:34:21.488
Guys, there's more.

517
00:34:35.696 --> 00:34:36.614
Diamonds.

518
00:34:38.154 --> 00:34:39.072
Bling.

519
00:34:43.321 --> 00:34:47.947
Crystals are frequently formed
and found...

520
00:34:49.023 --> 00:34:49.930
...in...

521
00:34:52.129 --> 00:34:53.363
volcanic tubes.

522
00:35:00.112 --> 00:35:02.404
This tube could take us back up, right?

523
00:35:03.195 --> 00:35:04.696
We're not far from the surface.

524
00:35:05.529 --> 00:35:07.155
When we get out, I'm getting a Maserati.

525
00:35:07.612 --> 00:35:09.648
Money is not the only thing
that matters, Sean.

526
00:35:09.738 --> 00:35:10.863
People matter too, you know.

527
00:35:12.154 --> 00:35:14.404
-Something like that.
-Not if you have a Maserati.

528
00:35:18.154 --> 00:35:19.075
Did you guys hear that?

529
00:35:20.446 --> 00:35:21.364
Nobody move.

530
00:35:35.529 --> 00:35:37.050
Tell me that's not what I think it is.

531
00:35:40.987 --> 00:35:43.070
-Muscovite.
-Muscovite.

532
00:35:43.654 --> 00:35:44.572
What's Muscovite?

533
00:35:47.945 --> 00:35:51.064
Muscovite is a very thin type
of rock formation.

534
00:35:51.154 --> 00:35:52.064
How thin?

535
00:35:52.154 --> 00:35:55.606
Well, so thin that the slightest change
in weight and pressure...

536
00:35:55.696 --> 00:35:58.030
...can cause it to shatter.

537
00:35:58.738 --> 00:36:00.099
And we're standing on a lot of it.

538
00:36:02.321 --> 00:36:03.321
Just stop.

539
00:36:07.362 --> 00:36:08.280
Okay, they're stopped.

540
00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:12.380
Okay, Sean, I need you to walk back
exactly the way we came from.

541
00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:14.571
Very, very calmly, okay?

542
00:36:14.987 --> 00:36:16.738
Tread lightly. Heel, toe.

543
00:36:17.571 --> 00:36:20.738
-Doing good.
-Doing great. Very slowly.

544
00:36:21.321 --> 00:36:22.239
Good. Come on.

545
00:36:29.029 --> 00:36:29.947
That's it.

546
00:36:31.612 --> 00:36:32.530
That's great.

547
00:36:33.154 --> 00:36:34.321
-Really careful.
-Keep going.

548
00:36:36.195 --> 00:36:37.195
No!

549
00:36:51.779 --> 00:36:53.259
It's actually thicker than I thought.

550
00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:09.946
We're still falling!

551
00:37:23.279 --> 00:37:24.780
Trevor, what's at the bottom?

552
00:37:25.029 --> 00:37:27.105
Well, if what Verne wrote was right...

553
00:37:27.195 --> 00:37:29.696
...these tunnels could go for hundreds,
thousands of miles.

554
00:37:29.862 --> 00:37:31.237
Verne was not right.

555
00:37:31.446 --> 00:37:33.155
Trevor, finish. What's at the bottom?

556
00:37:33.321 --> 00:37:35.655
Most likely theory is that
it probably just ends.

557
00:37:35.779 --> 00:37:38.571
Ends? Got any other theories?

558
00:37:38.906 --> 00:37:42.231
Well, the walls of this tunnel
could have gently eroded...

559
00:37:42.321 --> 00:37:47.439
...by water which still runs through it,
providing a gradual break to our fall.

560
00:37:47.529 --> 00:37:49.779
-Kind of like a water slide.
-Water slide.

561
00:37:50.696 --> 00:37:52.197
Okay, that's a theory.

562
00:37:52.321 --> 00:37:55.105
But, Trevor, wouldn't the water
have formed stalagmites...

563
00:37:55.195 --> 00:37:56.564
...pointing straight up at us?

564
00:37:56.654 --> 00:37:58.821
-We'll be skewered.
-That is also possible.

565
00:38:15.314 --> 00:38:18.071
-Is that water?
-Yes. Water.

566
00:38:18.321 --> 00:38:20.272
Water slide, water slide, water slide..

567
00:38:20.362 --> 00:38:22.946
Here it comes. Hang on!

568
00:39:01.529 --> 00:39:03.529
Sean! Sean!

569
00:39:04.154 --> 00:39:06.481
Sean, Sean, you all right?

570
00:39:06.571 --> 00:39:07.780
We didn't get skewered.

571
00:39:08.738 --> 00:39:09.738
Make for the rocks.

572
00:39:19.404 --> 00:39:20.322
Where's Hannah?

573
00:39:21.738 --> 00:39:23.905
Hannah! Hannah!

574
00:39:38.987 --> 00:39:40.696
My backpack was too heavy.

575
00:40:00.154 --> 00:40:01.072
Thank you.

576
00:40:02.404 --> 00:40:03.821
So where does that put us now?

577
00:40:07.529 --> 00:40:08.447
Back to one.

578
00:40:13.029 --> 00:40:14.738
Guys, where are we?

579
00:40:15.279 --> 00:40:16.362
Are those stars?

580
00:40:23.779 --> 00:40:24.697
No.

581
00:40:25.571 --> 00:40:27.821
That's just the ceiling of the cave.

582
00:40:28.612 --> 00:40:33.612
Is it just me,
or is the cave ceiling moving?

583
00:40:36.654 --> 00:40:37.572
Yeah.

584
00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:41.487
It does look like it, doesn't it?

585
00:41:04.987 --> 00:41:06.571
They're birds.

586
00:41:09.279 --> 00:41:10.821
Electric birds?

587
00:41:11.195 --> 00:41:13.320
They look like Cyanis rosopteryx.

588
00:41:13.987 --> 00:41:18.397
Only they're bioluminescent,
like fireflies or glowworms.

589
00:41:18.487 --> 00:41:19.405
It's incredible.

590
00:41:31.154 --> 00:41:34.863
Cool. Glow birds.

591
00:41:45.362 --> 00:41:46.843
Have you seen these creatures before?

592
00:41:47.154 --> 00:41:49.105
Yeah, in the museum,
but they were fossilized.

593
00:41:49.195 --> 00:41:52.404
These things have been extinct
for over 150 million years.

594
00:42:05.070 --> 00:42:06.779
-Where are they going?
-Hey, a tunnel.

595
00:42:08.321 --> 00:42:09.239
Guys, come on.

596
00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:12.987
Sean, wait. Wait for me.

597
00:42:41.237 --> 00:42:45.529
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the center of the Earth.

598
00:42:50.237 --> 00:42:51.196
Max was right.

599
00:42:52.945 --> 00:42:53.945
He was right.

600
00:42:55.446 --> 00:42:58.030
Max was right!

601
00:43:01.696 --> 00:43:04.447
Your dad was right. He was right.

602
00:43:05.529 --> 00:43:07.321
Hannah, your dad was right too.

603
00:43:08.612 --> 00:43:12.904
They both believed in something
that everyone told them was impossible.

604
00:43:13.654 --> 00:43:14.613
He was right.

605
00:43:18.112 --> 00:43:19.192
What's that light up there?

606
00:43:20.654 --> 00:43:22.254
I can't tell. It must be some sort of...

607
00:43:24.612 --> 00:43:26.530
...luminescent gas combination.

608
00:43:27.696 --> 00:43:28.614
I don't know.

609
00:43:29.696 --> 00:43:32.071
It's like a terrarium.

610
00:43:32.195 --> 00:43:35.862
A terrarium thousands of miles
beneath the crust of the Earth.

611
00:43:38.571 --> 00:43:42.072
A world within the world.

612
00:43:55.237 --> 00:43:59.404
"The waterfalls, which for a long time,
could be heard flowing from afar."

613
00:44:00.195 --> 00:44:03.904
"Now cascaded
along the towering canyon walls,"

614
00:44:04.154 --> 00:44:06.446
"streaming along the rock with no end."

615
00:44:07.029 --> 00:44:08.947
I mean, it's the same thing
Liedenbrock wrote.

616
00:44:09.362 --> 00:44:13.612
Are we saying that Liedenbrock
the character was real?

617
00:44:13.738 --> 00:44:14.821
That he existed?

618
00:44:15.029 --> 00:44:18.530
Someone came down here.
Someone saw all this.

619
00:44:18.696 --> 00:44:21.564
Someone got out and someone told Verne.

620
00:44:21.654 --> 00:44:22.572
Somebody got out?

621
00:44:23.779 --> 00:44:25.397
That's the best thing I've heard all day.

622
00:44:25.487 --> 00:44:27.946
I mean, doesn't this
just completely blow your mind?

623
00:44:51.696 --> 00:44:53.280
My mind is blown, yes.

624
00:45:02.612 --> 00:45:05.530
Enormous fossilized mushrooms.

625
00:45:06.029 --> 00:45:07.863
Sort of like humongous fungus.

626
00:45:11.903 --> 00:45:14.320
-Everything in the book is real?
-Probably.

627
00:45:14.529 --> 00:45:17.321
-And the really dangerous parts?
-I was thinking about that too.

628
00:45:17.612 --> 00:45:18.530
Right.

629
00:45:20.612 --> 00:45:21.772
Trevor, come quick.

630
00:45:21.862 --> 00:45:22.904
-Sean?
-Sean?

631
00:45:47.738 --> 00:45:49.239
-I'm going in.
-Yeah, wait up.

632
00:45:50.529 --> 00:45:51.447
Hey, slow down.

633
00:45:53.112 --> 00:45:54.030
I'll be right there.

634
00:46:20.029 --> 00:46:21.488
Someone actually lived here?

635
00:46:22.446 --> 00:46:23.446
That somebody...

636
00:46:25.987 --> 00:46:26.987
...was Liedenbrock.

637
00:46:30.070 --> 00:46:30.988
Look at all his gear.

638
00:46:32.696 --> 00:46:36.405
All this, state-of-the-art, a century ago.

639
00:47:36.237 --> 00:47:37.155
Hey, Trevor.

640
00:47:38.404 --> 00:47:39.965
I think I found Liedenbrock's notebook.

641
00:47:43.070 --> 00:47:43.988
Look.

642
00:47:44.945 --> 00:47:46.231
Looks like on the other side
of those trees,

643
00:47:46.321 --> 00:47:48.488
there's some sort of underground ocean.

644
00:47:49.112 --> 00:47:50.030
Yeah.

645
00:47:51.612 --> 00:47:53.452
I don't think
that's Liedenbrock's handwriting.

646
00:48:00.404 --> 00:48:01.322
It's my dad's.

647
00:48:03.862 --> 00:48:04.780
Trevor?

648
00:48:06.446 --> 00:48:07.364
Trevor?

649
00:48:12.321 --> 00:48:15.363
Can I talk to you for a minute? Out here.

650
00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:17.060
Can you wait here for a minute?

651
00:48:33.654 --> 00:48:35.488
Hey, I think I found Max.

652
00:49:13.487 --> 00:49:16.988
I never really got a chance to know him.

653
00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:23.820
I mean, I wish I did.

654
00:49:24.654 --> 00:49:27.238
He wrote something
and I want you to hear it.

655
00:49:31.279 --> 00:49:34.197
"August 14, 1997."

656
00:49:36.404 --> 00:49:38.322
"Today was Sean's third birthday."

657
00:49:40.945 --> 00:49:44.481
"Six weeks ago, I promised myself
I would be home in time..."

658
00:49:44.571 --> 00:49:46.363
"...to give him his first baseball glove."

659
00:49:48.029 --> 00:49:50.487
"Now I'm worried..."

660
00:49:52.362 --> 00:49:53.803
"...that I'll never get the chance."

661
00:49:58.903 --> 00:50:03.903
"I set out to make an incredible discovery
to share with Trevor and the world."

662
00:50:05.779 --> 00:50:08.988
"But now, I would trade it all..."

663
00:50:10.237 --> 00:50:16.155
"...just to be able to watch you grow up,
to be the brave and caring man..."

664
00:50:17.145 --> 00:50:19.863
"...I am certain you will become."

665
00:50:24.571 --> 00:50:25.696
"Happy birthday, Sean."

666
00:50:27.945 --> 00:50:30.195
"I love you. Daddy."

667
00:50:46.768 --> 00:50:47.821
Goodbye, Max.

668
00:50:59.404 --> 00:51:00.322
Come on.

669
00:51:21.070 --> 00:51:22.529
According to Max's journal...

670
00:51:22.945 --> 00:51:28.070
...we're here in this giant air pocket
that's surrounded by lava.

671
00:51:28.654 --> 00:51:31.946
And during periods
of intense seismic activity...

672
00:51:34.987 --> 00:51:36.987
-Like the one we're in now.
-That's right.

673
00:51:38.654 --> 00:51:40.654
The magma that surrounds us...

674
00:51:40.862 --> 00:51:43.321
...turns this place
into pretty much just a big oven.

675
00:51:44.112 --> 00:51:45.432
Was that what happened to my dad?

676
00:51:53.487 --> 00:51:55.808
Look, I know I'm just a kid,
but I can handle this, really.

677
00:51:56.404 --> 00:51:57.322
Sit down.

678
00:51:59.987 --> 00:52:01.488
Max was planning an escape.

679
00:52:01.696 --> 00:52:06.439
His notes say that temperatures down here
can easily hit 200 degrees.

680
00:52:06.529 --> 00:52:09.030
A human being can't survive beyond 135.

681
00:52:09.154 --> 00:52:10.397
It's already 95 degrees.

682
00:52:10.487 --> 00:52:12.821
It was 82 when we got here.
Temperature's rising quickly.

683
00:52:13.362 --> 00:52:16.113
-So, what do we do?
-I say that we follow Max's plan.

684
00:52:16.487 --> 00:52:17.405
Here's what he wrote.

685
00:52:18.195 --> 00:52:20.278
"My analysis
of the original Verne text..."

686
00:52:20.404 --> 00:52:22.356
"...leads me to believe
that across the ocean..."

687
00:52:22.446 --> 00:52:24.571
"...due north of my current position..."

688
00:52:25.029 --> 00:52:28.897
"...is a geyser-like river which could be
used to return to the surface."

689
00:52:28.987 --> 00:52:30.907
So what we have to do
is get across this ocean...

690
00:52:31.112 --> 00:52:34.738
...and find the geyser
and just hitch a ride topside.

691
00:52:35.612 --> 00:52:38.113
-Topside sounds good.
-It's a little trickier than that.

692
00:52:38.529 --> 00:52:40.904
It could get so hot down here
that the water'll evaporate.

693
00:52:41.154 --> 00:52:44.738
-How much time do we have?
-Forty-eight hours, 72, tops.

694
00:52:46.446 --> 00:52:47.405
Probably less.

695
00:52:47.862 --> 00:52:49.363
Okay, so the question is,

696
00:52:50.237 --> 00:52:52.648
what is the fastest way
to get across the ocean?

697
00:52:52.738 --> 00:52:55.113
There's no way we can get around it,
because if we hike...

698
00:52:55.237 --> 00:52:57.821
Oh, we don't have time.
There's no time to do that.

699
00:53:01.779 --> 00:53:02.697
It's all in the book.

700
00:53:09.779 --> 00:53:10.697
Hey, you all right?

701
00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:14.529
-What's the temperature doing?
-It is 100 degrees.

702
00:53:23.112 --> 00:53:25.613
Eat your trilobite, Sean.
We gotta keep our strength up.

703
00:53:27.571 --> 00:53:28.489
Attaboy.

704
00:53:33.654 --> 00:53:34.572
Hey.

705
00:53:35.279 --> 00:53:38.571
-Don't we need a center mast?
-No. We don't need it.

706
00:53:39.862 --> 00:53:41.780
The wind that we want is way up there.

707
00:53:42.446 --> 00:53:44.947
Thermal. It's a lot faster
than what we got down here.

708
00:53:49.987 --> 00:53:51.548
Good job. That should just about do it.

709
00:53:51.779 --> 00:53:53.821
Hey, I got something for you.

710
00:53:59.070 --> 00:54:00.988
-What is this?
-It's a compass.

711
00:54:01.862 --> 00:54:02.780
It was your dad's.

712
00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:06.195
I remember the Christmas
that your mom gave it to him.

713
00:54:06.571 --> 00:54:11.946
She wanted to make sure
that he could always find a way back home.

714
00:54:13.237 --> 00:54:16.863
And maybe it will help you
find a way back to her.

715
00:54:23.029 --> 00:54:24.738
-Thanks, Trevor.
-You got it.

716
00:54:24.945 --> 00:54:26.446
-It means a lot to me.
-Me too.

717
00:54:28.696 --> 00:54:32.030
Oh, there's one thing you should know.
Down here, the polarity is reversed.

718
00:54:33.362 --> 00:54:35.196
I mean, north is south, south is north...

719
00:54:35.321 --> 00:54:38.571
...and we need to bear due north
across the sea.

720
00:54:38.779 --> 00:54:40.280
You mean, south.

721
00:54:41.404 --> 00:54:42.322
Exactly.

722
00:55:05.237 --> 00:55:06.946
All right, it's starting to pick up now.

723
00:55:08.029 --> 00:55:10.238
Okay, hold it. Hold it really steady.

724
00:55:10.738 --> 00:55:11.780
Good, good, good.

725
00:55:13.321 --> 00:55:15.321
-Good. Ready?
-Yeah.

726
00:55:15.696 --> 00:55:17.322
Three, two, one, go!

727
00:55:19.945 --> 00:55:20.945
-Yeah.
-All right.

728
00:55:21.362 --> 00:55:22.612
-Yeah.
-All right.

729
00:55:30.862 --> 00:55:32.488
Go, go, go.

730
00:55:34.279 --> 00:55:35.780
Yeah. Keep going.

731
00:55:43.820 --> 00:55:47.070
Whoa, we're going, we're going.
Hey, well, can you wait for me?

732
00:55:47.237 --> 00:55:49.029
Well, get on. Come on, come on, let's go.

733
00:56:06.321 --> 00:56:08.780
He's back. Hey, little guy.

734
00:56:15.195 --> 00:56:17.737
-Seen those clouds?
-Yeah.

735
00:56:18.738 --> 00:56:20.522
The current's pulling us
in the direction we wanna go.

736
00:56:20.612 --> 00:56:22.029
Maybe we should lower the kite.

737
00:56:25.279 --> 00:56:28.863
Can't do that. It's a 109 degrees.
It's getting hotter.

738
00:56:29.237 --> 00:56:31.155
We need all the speed we can get.
Leave it up.

739
00:56:37.987 --> 00:56:40.905
It's just a little storm.
Ain't no big deal.

740
00:56:48.779 --> 00:56:50.238
Something moving down there.

741
00:56:51.779 --> 00:56:53.196
Phosphorous and plankton.

742
00:56:53.321 --> 00:56:55.239
It's the same thing we saw
back at the beach.

743
00:56:55.612 --> 00:56:57.772
I don't know.
It looks kind of big for plankton.

744
00:56:57.862 --> 00:57:01.147
Sean, we're not at SeaWorld,
so back off a little bit. All right?

745
00:57:01.237 --> 00:57:02.904
I think it's some sort of fish.

746
00:57:05.696 --> 00:57:06.614
Helvitis!

747
00:57:14.279 --> 00:57:15.197
No.

748
00:57:21.903 --> 00:57:22.813
They're everywhere.

749
00:57:22.903 --> 00:57:24.703
Sean, I told you
we'd get to the batting cage.

750
00:57:25.321 --> 00:57:26.239
Batter up.

751
00:57:27.571 --> 00:57:29.780
Okay. Let's see what you've got.

752
00:57:31.529 --> 00:57:33.113
Yeah. Line drive.

753
00:57:38.903 --> 00:57:40.362
-Sean!
-Do you hear something?

754
00:57:43.738 --> 00:57:44.821
-Hello?
-<i>Sean.</i>

755
00:57:45.070 --> 00:57:46.980
-Mom?
-<i>I think we have a bad connection.</i>

756
00:57:47.070 --> 00:57:48.195
Mom, I can't hear you.

757
00:57:48.945 --> 00:57:49.863
<i>Where are you?</i>

758
00:57:50.612 --> 00:57:51.695
Uncle Trevor and I...

759
00:57:54.070 --> 00:57:56.696
...we're sort of on a fishing trip and...

760
00:57:57.654 --> 00:57:58.737
<i>Are you having fun?</i>

761
00:58:01.945 --> 00:58:03.231
Whoa, no, you don't.

762
00:58:03.321 --> 00:58:05.571
Uncle Trevor just caught a really big one.

763
00:58:05.945 --> 00:58:06.863
<i>Sean?</i>

764
00:58:07.321 --> 00:58:09.202
-My phone.
-Sean, do you know how to switch hit?

765
00:58:11.362 --> 00:58:12.529
-Ready?
-Yeah.

766
00:58:14.654 --> 00:58:15.730
Out of the ball park.

767
00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:17.064
-Sean!
-Look out!

768
00:58:17.154 --> 00:58:18.154
I got it, I got it.

769
00:58:25.571 --> 00:58:26.689
-Sean.
-No, no, don't.

770
00:58:26.779 --> 00:58:27.821
Get away from the sides.

771
00:58:34.029 --> 00:58:34.990
Look what they're doing.

772
00:58:35.779 --> 00:58:37.530
They don't want us. They want the fish.

773
00:58:37.696 --> 00:58:40.197
Listen up. Sean, you take the tiller,
we'll get the line.

774
00:58:41.029 --> 00:58:42.029
Hannah, hold the slack.

775
00:58:42.779 --> 00:58:45.154
-Sean, you wanna take us hard starboard?
-What?

776
00:58:46.321 --> 00:58:47.239
That way.

777
00:58:51.446 --> 00:58:52.364
Come on.

778
00:58:54.195 --> 00:58:55.862
-Okay.
-Doing good.

779
00:58:58.029 --> 00:58:59.863
Now just let it out gently.
Let it out gently.

780
00:59:00.740 --> 00:59:01.980
Let it out slowly.

781
00:59:02.279 --> 00:59:03.279
It's working.

782
00:59:03.779 --> 00:59:05.029
We're pulling clear of them.

783
00:59:11.195 --> 00:59:12.439
You're the man, Uncle Trev.

784
00:59:12.529 --> 00:59:15.529
That's what I've been telling
the scientific community for years.

785
00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:22.903
Hannah. You're safe.

786
00:59:29.070 --> 00:59:29.988
The lines.

787
00:59:47.321 --> 00:59:48.321
-Got it.
-Sean.

788
00:59:49.112 --> 00:59:50.779
Sean, don't do that. No, Sean.

789
00:59:51.070 --> 00:59:51.988
Sean!

790
00:59:53.279 --> 00:59:56.105
-No, Sean!
-Trevor!

791
00:59:56.195 --> 00:59:57.064
Sean!

792
00:59:57.154 --> 01:00:01.154
Hang on! Don't let go!

793
01:00:08.738 --> 01:00:09.614
No.

794
01:01:08.321 --> 01:01:09.239
Trevor?

795
01:01:11.945 --> 01:01:12.904
Trevor?

796
01:01:19.987 --> 01:01:20.905
Hello?

797
01:01:24.321 --> 01:01:25.239
Hello?

798
01:01:27.696 --> 01:01:29.322
Hey, little guy. Where are we?

799
01:01:34.987 --> 01:01:36.707
Hey, do you know
where I can get some water?

800
01:01:38.362 --> 01:01:41.196
I'm talking to a bird.
I must be losing it.

801
01:01:53.738 --> 01:01:55.155
Sean!

802
01:01:59.696 --> 01:02:01.405
Sean!

803
01:02:05.987 --> 01:02:06.905
Wait.

804
01:02:11.529 --> 01:02:12.738
The wind blew him this way.

805
01:02:15.279 --> 01:02:16.200
We still heading north?

806
01:02:18.738 --> 01:02:19.738
Yeah, still north.

807
01:02:20.279 --> 01:02:23.946
He's a smart kid. He knows the plan.
I'm sure he'll be waiting by the river.

808
01:02:26.195 --> 01:02:27.278
Let's find that river.

809
01:02:32.987 --> 01:02:35.154
Hey, come on, wait up.

810
01:02:42.738 --> 01:02:43.614
Where'd you go?

811
01:02:51.362 --> 01:02:52.280
Good job.

812
01:02:58.903 --> 01:02:59.821
Okay.

813
01:03:01.903 --> 01:03:02.821
Now which way?

814
01:03:09.696 --> 01:03:13.363
South. That's good. The river's north.

815
01:03:15.321 --> 01:03:16.239
Okay.

816
01:03:19.612 --> 01:03:22.481
-Here, let me take that.
-No, no, I'm fine.

817
01:03:22.571 --> 01:03:24.648
-Come on, let me take it.
-Trevor, I'm fine.

818
01:03:24.738 --> 01:03:25.821
Hannah, Hannah, I got it.

819
01:03:26.696 --> 01:03:27.856
Let's just stop for a second.

820
01:03:35.321 --> 01:03:37.780
Hey, we're gonna find him.

821
01:03:43.738 --> 01:03:44.738
Drink that.

822
01:03:45.987 --> 01:03:47.987
-Is that the last of the water?
-Yeah.

823
01:03:48.404 --> 01:03:49.730
Trevor, we're gonna need that.
Why don't you keep it?

824
01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:51.779
Hannah, drink it.

825
01:03:54.404 --> 01:03:55.322
Come on.

826
01:04:06.862 --> 01:04:07.780
Duck!

827
01:04:10.738 --> 01:04:12.489
-What the...?
-What was that?

828
01:04:15.362 --> 01:04:16.863
Large carnivorous plant?

829
01:04:17.987 --> 01:04:18.905
Hannah.

830
01:04:20.362 --> 01:04:21.280
Hannah?

831
01:04:22.404 --> 01:04:23.322
Hannah.

832
01:04:24.279 --> 01:04:25.197
Hannah.

833
01:04:30.037 --> 01:04:31.072
Hannah!

834
01:04:53.466 --> 01:04:54.333
Hang in there.

835
01:05:02.321 --> 01:05:04.488
-That's one point for me, right?
-Right.

836
01:05:05.321 --> 01:05:07.321
Who's keeping track, right?

837
01:05:52.070 --> 01:05:52.961
I get it.

838
01:05:53.908 --> 01:05:55.327
It's a magnetic field.

839
01:06:21.404 --> 01:06:24.155
No way. Magnetic rocks?

840
01:08:01.487 --> 01:08:03.612
No, no, no.

841
01:08:23.571 --> 01:08:25.322
No. No.

842
01:08:51.820 --> 01:08:53.154
You try that without wings.

843
01:09:08.279 --> 01:09:11.446
That's the river.
Geyser must be inside that cave.

844
01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:17.487
Sean!

845
01:09:28.321 --> 01:09:29.239
Where is he?

846
01:09:30.029 --> 01:09:31.738
Where is he?

847
01:09:49.321 --> 01:09:50.239
Trevor?

848
01:09:55.439 --> 01:09:56.489
Trevor.

849
01:10:20.321 --> 01:10:23.988
Man, I really wish I'd read that book.

850
01:10:57.779 --> 01:10:58.779
I don't see him anywhere.

851
01:11:08.862 --> 01:11:12.363
Trevor? Trevor.
Hang on a minute. What are you doing?

852
01:11:12.696 --> 01:11:13.863
I'm going to get my nephew.

853
01:11:16.571 --> 01:11:17.555
Hannah.

854
01:11:18.474 --> 01:11:21.703
This is all my fault.

855
01:11:23.487 --> 01:11:24.446
Save yourself.

856
01:11:25.529 --> 01:11:26.612
Just go home.

857
01:11:28.279 --> 01:11:32.113
I'll wait for you at the river
for as long as I can.

858
01:11:40.529 --> 01:11:41.529
What did you do that for?

859
01:11:45.070 --> 01:11:46.070
Just in case.

860
01:12:56.945 --> 01:12:59.195
Sean!

861
01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:00.738
Sean!

862
01:13:20.612 --> 01:13:21.530
Sean!

863
01:13:23.862 --> 01:13:24.780
Sean?

864
01:13:26.987 --> 01:13:27.905
Sean!

865
01:13:34.696 --> 01:13:36.113
Sean! Sean!

866
01:13:57.903 --> 01:13:58.779
Come on!

867
01:14:03.279 --> 01:14:05.488
-Oh, God, I'm glad to see you.
-Yeah, you too.

868
01:14:05.945 --> 01:14:07.446
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

869
01:14:08.237 --> 01:14:09.155
We should go.

870
01:14:10.903 --> 01:14:11.821
Wait, wait, wait.

871
01:14:12.321 --> 01:14:14.401
-Is that the geyser?
-Yeah, that's where we're going.

872
01:14:17.237 --> 01:14:18.155
Come on.

873
01:14:19.945 --> 01:14:23.154
-Haven't you ever seen a dinosaur before?
-Not with skin on it.

874
01:14:29.779 --> 01:14:31.363
He's too fast. We're not gonna make it.

875
01:14:37.138 --> 01:14:39.445
-Trevor, what are you doing?
-That's Muscovite.

876
01:14:39.945 --> 01:14:42.028
Same thing that we fell through before.

877
01:14:42.221 --> 01:14:43.904
There's no way it's gonna hold you.

878
01:14:44.237 --> 01:14:46.606
It can't hold him either. Now you run.

879
01:14:46.696 --> 01:14:47.614
Trevor, no.

880
01:14:51.529 --> 01:14:54.696
-It's not breaking, Trevor.
-Keep running!

881
01:14:58.987 --> 01:15:01.905
-He's gaining on you.
-I know. Keep going.

882
01:15:07.321 --> 01:15:08.655
Trevor, it's working.

883
01:15:15.654 --> 01:15:16.572
Look out!

884
01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:28.988
Trevor!

885
01:15:35.779 --> 01:15:38.613
I just remembered something.
I hate field work.

886
01:15:39.779 --> 01:15:40.779
Trevor, come on.

887
01:15:44.237 --> 01:15:46.105
That was like...
And then you were like...

888
01:15:46.195 --> 01:15:48.404
Yeah, I know. I'm really lucky.

889
01:15:48.862 --> 01:15:50.529
Okay, that way.

890
01:15:50.696 --> 01:15:53.779
That, no good. That, worse.

891
01:15:54.404 --> 01:15:55.322
Let's go.

892
01:16:03.487 --> 01:16:06.238
The river.
How are we gonna get to the geyser?

893
01:16:06.362 --> 01:16:08.612
-Water's boiling.
-We need something that floats.

894
01:16:08.738 --> 01:16:11.780
Anything. I could use a log or...
What we really need is a boat.

895
01:16:25.654 --> 01:16:26.737
Who had dibs again?

896
01:16:29.945 --> 01:16:30.863
Come on, jump in.

897
01:16:30.987 --> 01:16:32.356
She's the best mountain guide
on the planet.

898
01:16:32.446 --> 01:16:33.364
Got that right.

899
01:16:36.903 --> 01:16:39.343
You didn't really think you were gonna
scare me away, did you?

900
01:16:40.321 --> 01:16:41.822
You'll have to work harder than that.

901
01:16:52.945 --> 01:16:55.154
I'm afraid I'll have to charge you extra
for this bit.

902
01:16:55.529 --> 01:16:56.447
Can I open a tab?

903
01:16:59.321 --> 01:17:00.280
What was that?

904
01:17:01.862 --> 01:17:03.862
It's not good. That's the river bed.

905
01:17:04.738 --> 01:17:05.819
We're running out of water.

906
01:17:08.070 --> 01:17:10.397
Well, guys, you might wanna
hang on to something.

907
01:17:10.487 --> 01:17:14.071
This ride is about to get a little bit...

908
01:17:22.112 --> 01:17:23.030
...bumpy.

909
01:17:27.154 --> 01:17:29.030
-Is everybody all right?
-Yeah.

910
01:17:29.237 --> 01:17:30.155
Where are we?

911
01:17:32.862 --> 01:17:34.022
What's that light down there?

912
01:17:35.154 --> 01:17:36.154
That's lava.

913
01:17:37.029 --> 01:17:39.738
It's magma, and it's rising.

914
01:17:40.195 --> 01:17:41.147
There's supposed to be water
in this tunnel.

915
01:17:41.237 --> 01:17:43.272
You know, steam and water
shooting up the tunnel.

916
01:17:43.362 --> 01:17:45.083
We're too late for the geyser,
we missed it.

917
01:17:45.987 --> 01:17:48.356
-What do we do, Trevor?
-Do you have any suggestions, professor?

918
01:17:48.446 --> 01:17:49.980
I mean, without any water
there's no steam.

919
01:17:50.070 --> 01:17:51.772
Without any steam,
we're not going anywhere.

920
01:17:51.862 --> 01:17:55.356
This place looks like there hasn't been
any water here in two, three hours now.

921
01:17:55.446 --> 01:17:58.821
-But the walls are still wet.
-That's impossible, it's 130 degrees.

922
01:17:58.945 --> 01:17:59.813
-Trevor.
-What?

923
01:17:59.903 --> 01:18:00.821
Behind you.

924
01:18:03.237 --> 01:18:04.155
It is wet.

925
01:18:05.279 --> 01:18:07.404
It's cold. There's water behind here.

926
01:18:08.070 --> 01:18:09.356
There's gotta be water
behind some pocket...

927
01:18:09.446 --> 01:18:10.730
...or underground river
or something like that.

928
01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:12.321
Trevor, it's getting closer.

929
01:18:13.279 --> 01:18:15.988
Hey, that's magnesium.

930
01:18:19.404 --> 01:18:21.805
-Guys, we're slipping.
-Flares. How many flares you got left?

931
01:18:26.738 --> 01:18:28.280
Three. What do you wanna do with them?

932
01:18:28.446 --> 01:18:30.655
Gonna light the magnesium.
This time on purpose.

933
01:18:32.321 --> 01:18:33.239
Hang on.

934
01:18:38.195 --> 01:18:40.278
Oh, come on. It's too wet.

935
01:18:45.070 --> 01:18:47.153
Got to get further down.
Give me another one.

936
01:18:49.279 --> 01:18:50.279
Hold my legs.

937
01:18:55.779 --> 01:18:56.697
Come on.

938
01:19:02.237 --> 01:19:04.437
You're gonna have to tie me off.
I gotta get down lower.

939
01:19:05.279 --> 01:19:06.780
Trevor, it's getting closer.

940
01:19:08.321 --> 01:19:09.947
That's good. All right, ready.

941
01:19:13.862 --> 01:19:14.780
It's the last one.

942
01:19:31.945 --> 01:19:32.863
Trevor, be careful.

943
01:19:37.195 --> 01:19:38.689
-How's that?
-Little more.

944
01:19:38.779 --> 01:19:39.697
Hurry.

945
01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:45.696
-Lower?
-Little more.

946
01:19:46.862 --> 01:19:47.780
Okay, hold off.

947
01:19:49.154 --> 01:19:50.446
-Come on.
-Come on.

948
01:19:51.362 --> 01:19:53.071
-Come on, light.
-Come on.

949
01:19:55.487 --> 01:19:57.272
-Come on, Trevor.
-Still wet down here.

950
01:19:57.362 --> 01:19:59.154
Gonna have to throw it to the other side.

951
01:20:18.279 --> 01:20:19.197
What?

952
01:20:19.945 --> 01:20:20.863
No.

953
01:20:21.487 --> 01:20:23.487
No!

954
01:20:28.362 --> 01:20:29.487
Trevor, come on.

955
01:20:30.654 --> 01:20:32.488
-Trevor, come on.
-It's lit, it's lit.

956
01:20:32.654 --> 01:20:34.897
-Pull! Pull me up.
-Hurry.

957
01:20:34.987 --> 01:20:36.779
Pull me up. Pull me up. Pull me up.

958
01:20:37.820 --> 01:20:40.195
-Come on, pull it. Pull it.
-Pull.

959
01:20:40.321 --> 01:20:41.822
Watch the teeth. Watch the teeth.

960
01:20:42.903 --> 01:20:44.320
Sean! Come on!

961
01:20:45.112 --> 01:20:46.279
Get down, it's gonna blow.

962
01:20:58.696 --> 01:21:02.113
-This thing's heating up.
-I know!

963
01:21:10.112 --> 01:21:13.195
-Hang on!
-Trust me, I'm hanging on!

964
01:21:15.195 --> 01:21:16.570
Is that sky?

965
01:21:31.237 --> 01:21:34.155
-Hang on, everybody!
-Stop saying that!

966
01:21:34.279 --> 01:21:35.654
It just keeps coming up!

967
01:22:26.154 --> 01:22:27.571
That's Mount Vesuvius.

968
01:22:28.195 --> 01:22:31.404
Hey, Sean, if your mom asks you
what you did this weekend...

969
01:22:31.903 --> 01:22:34.570
...you tell her
Uncle Trevor took you to Italy.

970
01:22:35.487 --> 01:22:36.405
-Italy?
-Si.

971
01:22:53.778 --> 01:22:55.737
-Sean?
-Sean?

972
01:22:58.279 --> 01:23:00.314
What? I just took
a few geological samples.

973
01:23:00.404 --> 01:23:02.030
A few geological samples?

974
01:23:02.321 --> 01:23:04.072
Okay, maybe a few pounds of samples.

975
01:23:04.195 --> 01:23:05.996
But what do you expect?
I'm a scientist's son.

976
01:23:08.029 --> 01:23:09.571
Look. Look.

977
01:23:10.279 --> 01:23:12.571
You take this.

978
01:23:13.029 --> 01:23:15.321
You take. We are sorry.

979
01:23:22.487 --> 01:23:25.363
You want slide again?

980
01:23:26.237 --> 01:23:29.446
Slide is okay. It's fine.
Anything what you want.

981
01:23:39.612 --> 01:23:42.446
-What was that for?
-Now we're even.

982
01:23:56.945 --> 01:23:59.446
Leonard, I'm back.
Stop doing what you're doing.

983
01:23:59.820 --> 01:24:01.147
What am I doing?

984
01:24:01.237 --> 01:24:03.779
Oh, look, you're looking for work.

985
01:24:03.945 --> 01:24:05.945
You don't need to,
because you have a job...

986
01:24:06.571 --> 01:24:09.863
...with the �sgeirsson-Anderson Institute
for Tectonophysical Exploration.

987
01:24:10.237 --> 01:24:12.522
The �sgeirsson-Anderson... What?

988
01:24:12.612 --> 01:24:14.606
We're still working on the name,
we haven't figured it out yet.

989
01:24:14.696 --> 01:24:16.863
But the point is,
rising tide lifts all boats.

990
01:24:17.237 --> 01:24:20.362
Man, that's awesome.
I think... Am I a boat?

991
01:24:21.237 --> 01:24:23.855
-You're a boat. We're back in business.
-All right, dude.

992
01:24:23.945 --> 01:24:26.689
Well, well, well.
What's all the excitement about?

993
01:24:26.779 --> 01:24:28.730
-Oh, hey, Alan. How are you?
-Good.

994
01:24:28.820 --> 01:24:33.029
-What you doing?
-Oh, me? I'm moving into my new lab.

995
01:24:33.487 --> 01:24:34.980
More importantly, where have you been?

996
01:24:35.070 --> 01:24:39.112
I heard you missed your Monday lecture
and both of your students complained.

997
01:24:41.529 --> 01:24:43.980
I took a quick vacation.
It was the best thing I could've done.

998
01:24:44.070 --> 01:24:45.356
That is exciting.

999
01:24:45.446 --> 01:24:47.855
You'll have to promise to tell me about it
one of these days, okay?

1000
01:24:47.945 --> 01:24:51.070
Not sure if I'll have time, but you can
read about it in "Scientific American."

1001
01:24:54.612 --> 01:24:55.730
"Scientific American?"

1002
01:24:55.820 --> 01:24:58.404
Look, I just want to say,
no hard feelings, okay?

1003
01:24:58.571 --> 01:25:00.946
About the laboratory moving
and expansion thing.

1004
01:25:01.070 --> 01:25:03.511
So, you know, I'm actually looking
for my own building anyway.

1005
01:25:03.696 --> 01:25:06.488
How exactly are you going to do that,
Trevor?

1006
01:25:07.529 --> 01:25:09.529
Well, let's just say
I fell into a small fortune.

1007
01:25:12.612 --> 01:25:14.404
So tomorrow you're gonna be a Canadian.

1008
01:25:14.820 --> 01:25:16.862
Yep. Looks that way.

1009
01:25:22.112 --> 01:25:25.946
I'd say that was a lot of male bonding
packed into very little time.

1010
01:25:26.154 --> 01:25:29.237
What do you say
we take a couple weeks next time?

1011
01:25:29.571 --> 01:25:30.439
A couple weeks?

1012
01:25:30.529 --> 01:25:33.654
-What are you doing over Christmas break?
-Nothing. I'm free.

1013
01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:35.341
I just found this in your dad's stuff.

1014
01:25:36.738 --> 01:25:37.656
Give it a read.

1015
01:25:38.321 --> 01:25:39.363
"Lost City of Atlantis."

1016
01:25:40.279 --> 01:25:41.197
We'll talk.

1017
01:25:45.029 --> 01:25:46.112
Sean, what is that?

1018
01:25:46.779 --> 01:25:48.655
-I'm just feeding my pet.
-What pet?

1019
01:25:49.029 --> 01:25:50.029
Sean.

1020
01:25:51.140 --> 01:25:55.237
-You think my mom will let me keep him?
-I don't know. Might not even stay here.

1021
01:25:56.237 --> 01:25:57.988
-Look at it.
-Hey, come on.

1022
01:25:58.487 --> 01:26:00.568
-This is your problem.
-Where are you going? Come on.

1023
01:26:01.070 --> 01:26:04.445
I got some food for you. Come on.
Come back down here. Come on.
