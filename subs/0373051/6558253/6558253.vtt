شون)، استمر في السير)

402
00:26:30.333 --> 00:26:32.528
يجب أن تستمر في السير

403
00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:35.760
جيد

404
00:26:37.974 --> 00:26:39.805
أنت تبدو جيداً هناك

405
00:26:39.976 --> 00:26:42.103
هل أنت متأكد أنك لم تفعل هذا من قبل؟ -
!اخرس -

406
00:26:43.479 --> 00:26:45.344
اسمع، هل لديك مانع؟
راقب خطواتك، أهذا ممكن؟

407
00:26:45.515 --> 00:26:47.210
أنا أتعلق بحياتي هنا

408
00:26:48.518 --> 00:26:50.952
(حسناً، يا (شون
فقط تحدث معي

409
00:26:52.221 --> 00:26:54.621
(قولي لي، يا (هانا
هل تأتين هنا كثيراً؟

410
00:26:55.058 --> 00:26:56.150
!أصمت أرجوك

411
00:26:56.326 --> 00:26:58.851
ليست هذه أفضل جملة تقولها
لتكسب اهتمامها

412
00:26:59.028 --> 00:27:02.794
أنا أتحدث معها -
لا، يا (شون)، أنا لا آتي هنا كثيراً -

413
00:27:03.833 --> 00:27:04.891
جاهز؟

414
00:27:13.476 --> 00:27:14.500
أنظروا

415
00:27:15.044 --> 00:27:16.739
أنظروا لكل هذا الصخر

416
00:27:16.913 --> 00:27:18.608
ماذا؟ -
إنه صخر متحول -

417
00:27:18.781 --> 00:27:21.579
صخر أخصر، عقيق أحمر، صخر مايكا

418
00:27:21.751 --> 00:27:25.209
!الصخر -
... إنه في كل مكان، أنظروا إليه، أعتقد -

419
00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:29.157
(تريفور)

420
00:27:35.798 --> 00:27:37.823
(اذهب للحائط، يا (تريفور
لا أستطيع

421
00:27:38.001 --> 00:27:41.334
لا يمكنني ذلك، الحوائط تتباعد بأسفل هنا -
حبلك مربوط بحبلي -

422
00:27:41.604 --> 00:27:43.868
سوف تأخذنا معك لأسفل
لابد أن أفصلك عنا

423
00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:45.166
ماذا؟ -
هانا)، لا) -

424
00:27:45.341 --> 00:27:47.502
تمهلي، انتظري، انتظري، انتظري

425
00:27:47.677 --> 00:27:48.666
لا تفعلي ذلك -
لا، لا، لا -

426
00:27:48.845 --> 00:27:49.971
(عمي (تريفور

427
00:27:58.721 --> 00:28:01.246
انظروا، يا رفاق، لقد وجدته

428
00:28:01.424 --> 00:28:02.857
القاع بأسفل هنا

429
00:28:03.226 --> 00:28:06.889
يا (هانا)، لقد كنتِ تعرفين ذلك، أليس كذلك؟

430
00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:09.029
أليس كذلك؟

431
00:28:09.432 --> 00:28:10.660
هانا)؟)

432
00:28:19.675 --> 00:28:22.769
يا رفاق، ما هذا؟

433
00:28:26.883 --> 00:28:28.874
يبدو لي وكأنه نفق منجم مهجور

434
00:28:29.052 --> 00:28:31.612
إنه نفق (بلاجيلز) القديم

435
00:28:32.288 --> 00:28:34.984
لقد تم إغلاقه منذ 60 سنة بعد كارثة كبيرة

436
00:28:35.158 --> 00:28:36.557
كارثة؟

437
00:28:36.859 --> 00:28:38.486
ما حجمها؟

438
00:28:38.661 --> 00:28:40.060
واحد وثمانين من الموتى

439
00:28:40.229 --> 00:28:41.253
هذا كبير إلى حد ما

440
00:28:42.565 --> 00:28:43.589
هيا

441
00:28:44.167 --> 00:28:45.930
!هيا، يا راعي البقر

442
00:28:47.437 --> 00:28:50.099
تريفور)، هل كان هناك نفق كهذا في الكتاب؟)

443
00:28:50.873 --> 00:28:52.966
لا، لا أظن ذلك

444
00:28:54.811 --> 00:28:56.335
هانا)؟) -
نعم؟ -

445
00:28:56.512 --> 00:28:58.503
هل يمكنني أن أسألكِ شيئاً؟

446
00:28:58.681 --> 00:29:05.177
هل تتساءلين إذا ما كان أبوكِ وأخي ليسوا مخطئين؟

447
00:29:05.988 --> 00:29:08.855
دعني أوضح لك شيئاً

448
00:29:09.492 --> 00:29:10.857
أنا لستُ أبي

449
00:29:11.494 --> 00:29:14.930
والعالم الذي كان ينتمي هو إليه
ليس له علاقة بي

450
00:29:15.098 --> 00:29:16.360
أفهم ذلك، بالطبع

451
00:29:16.532 --> 00:29:19.092
لم أكن أقصد أن أقول أنه عالمك
... أو أنه سيكون

452
00:29:19.268 --> 00:29:22.999
أنت تعرف أننا ما زلنا نعد الساعات، أليس كذلك؟ -
أما زلتِ ستحاسبينني على هذا الوقت؟ -

453
00:29:23.172 --> 00:29:26.938
سوف أحاسبك حتى أعود آمنة إلى بيتي

454
00:29:28.544 --> 00:29:31.411
هانا)؟)

455
00:29:35.852 --> 00:29:37.581
ما هذا؟

456
00:29:37.887 --> 00:29:40.879
إنه المولد القديم الخاص بالمنجم -
أنتِ، يجب ألا تلمسي هذا -

457
00:29:42.992 --> 00:29:44.391
ماذا تفعلين؟

458
00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:47.085
ربما يوجد هناك بعض المواد المتطايرة

459
00:29:47.263 --> 00:29:50.198
مولِّد خطير -
هانا)، هذا الشيء يمكن أن ينفجر) -

460
00:29:50.366 --> 00:29:51.424
توقفي عن تشغيل المفاتيح

461
00:29:51.601 --> 00:29:53.068
لا تفعلي هذا، لا، أنتظري

462
00:29:53.236 --> 00:29:54.726
ابتعدي عن ذلك الشيء

463
00:30:03.646 --> 00:30:06.046
حسناً، لقد تراجعتُ فيما قلتُ

464
00:30:11.821 --> 00:30:15.188
هذا هو، أليس كذلك؟ أعني أن عمال المنجم
كانوا بالتأكيد يُخرجون أشياءهم إلى مكان ما

465
00:30:15.358 --> 00:30:17.588
نعم -
هذه الطرق قد تُخرجنا من هنا -

466
00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.394
يا (هانا)، كم عامل استطاع الخروج؟

467
00:30:21.397 --> 00:30:22.830
واحد

468
00:30:23.299 --> 00:30:25.597
هذه بداية
سأركب في المقدمة

469
00:30:26.102 --> 00:30:27.433
ماذا؟ لا، لا، لا

470
00:30:27.603 --> 00:30:28.900
هيا، لا تدخل هناك

471
00:30:29.071 --> 00:30:30.902
لا نعرف إذا ما كانت هذه الأمور تعمل

472
00:30:31.073 --> 00:30:32.097
إنها ليست آمنة

473
00:30:32.275 --> 00:30:34.607
الممرات قد لا تكون آمنة

474
00:30:38.548 --> 00:30:41.381
الطريق للأمام يبدو جيداً، اركب

475
00:30:52.428 --> 00:30:54.953
يا (شون)، هذا لا يبدو آمناً
ما كنتُ لأفعل ذلك

476
00:30:55.131 --> 00:30:58.294
... أعتقد أنني أرى شيئاً ما، إنه

477
00:30:58.768 --> 00:31:01.801
أرجوك أخبرني أنه ضوء النهار
وإلا، فلا أريد أن أعرف

478
00:31:02.171 --> 00:31:03.695


479
00:31:03.873 --> 00:31:06.637
لا، إنه ليس ضوء النهار

480
00:31:06.809 --> 00:31:09.039
إننا داخل صخور عميقة

481
00:31:17.119 --> 00:31:19.087
ليته كان يوجد أحزمة مقاعد في هذا الشيء

482
00:31:19.255 --> 00:31:21.348
هل أنت قلق بشأن أحزمة المقاعد؟

483
00:31:32.168 --> 00:31:33.192


484
00:31:33.369 --> 00:31:34.734
!احترسي

485
00:31:45.681 --> 00:31:48.081
(هانا) -
أعرف -

486
00:31:48.251 --> 00:31:50.617
اجذبي الفرامل، اجذبي الفرامل -
لا، لا تفعل ذلك -

487
00:31:50.786 --> 00:31:51.980
لن ننجح

488
00:32:03.366 --> 00:32:05.163
نعم

489
00:32:06.302 --> 00:32:08.827
أحسنتِ صنعاً ، شكراً

490
00:32:10.373 --> 00:32:13.137
يا رفاق -
(ابق كما أنت، يا (شون -

491
00:32:23.119 --> 00:32:25.144

492
00:32:25.321 --> 00:32:29.121
هانا)، طريقك انتهى)

493
00:32:30.226 --> 00:32:31.716
اقفزي في مركبتي

494
00:32:32.228 --> 00:32:33.422
ماذا؟

495
00:32:33.596 --> 00:32:35.723
أسرعي، يجب أن تفعلي ذلك

496
00:32:35.898 --> 00:32:37.889
فقط اقفزي -
أعرف ذلك -

497
00:32:40.469 --> 00:32:42.232
مستعد؟

498
00:32:47.877 --> 00:32:50.209
تريفور)، طريقك ينتهي أيضاً)

499
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:56.975
حسناً -
ماذا تفعلين؟ -

500
00:32:57.453 --> 00:32:59.978
أريك الطريقة الصحيحة
لإنقاذ حياة شخص ما، هيا

501
00:33:00.156 --> 00:33:01.350
أيمكنني المساعدة؟ -
حسناً -

502
00:33:05.861 --> 00:33:07.351
مستعد؟

503
00:33:21.944 --> 00:33:24.105
هل أنتِ بخير؟ -
نعم -

504
00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:26.578
لحسن الحظ، أنا هبطتُ على شيء ليِّن

505
00:33:30.086 --> 00:33:32.486
أنت تدين لي باثنتين الآن

506
00:33:32.922 --> 00:33:36.085
من الذي يعُدّ؟ -
أنا -

507
00:33:39.829 --> 00:33:44.459
ذلك ... كان ... رائعاً

508
00:33:45.835 --> 00:33:48.463
ماذا حدث لكم، يا رفاق؟ -
لا تسأل -

509
00:33:53.709 --> 00:33:55.301
ما هذا؟

510
00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:59.980
إلى أين أنت ذاهب؟
لا تدخل هناك

511
00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:02.845
ما الذي تتحدثان عنه، يا رفاق؟
يمكن أن يكون هذا هو طريقنا للخروج

512
00:34:05.054 --> 00:34:07.215
هناك فتحة في الحائط

513
00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:09.290
يا رفاق، انظرا

514
00:34:13.596 --> 00:34:15.029
ياقوت

515
00:34:15.197 --> 00:34:16.926
زمرد

516
00:34:17.099 --> 00:34:18.691
فيلسبار

517
00:34:19.468 --> 00:34:22.596
يا  رفاق، هناك المزيد

518
00:34:35.684 --> 00:34:37.311
ماس

519
00:34:38.087 --> 00:34:39.611
أحجار كريمة

520
00:34:43.292 --> 00:34:48.093
... البلورات تتكون كثيراً وتوجد

521
00:34:48.964 --> 00:34:53.196
في ... القنوات البركانية ...

522
00:35:00.075 --> 00:35:02.373
هذا الأنبوب يمكن أن يعيدنا لأعلى، أليس كذلك؟

523
00:35:02.545 --> 00:35:04.604
لسنا بعيدين عن السطح

524
00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:07.476
(عندما أخرج سأشتري سيارة ماركة (ميزاراتي

525
00:35:07.650 --> 00:35:11.882
(المال ليس الشيء الوحيد المهم، يا (شون
البشر مهمون أيضاً، كما تعرف

526
00:35:12.054 --> 00:35:15.490
شيء من هذا القبيل -
(ليس لو كان لديك سيارة (ميزاراتي -

527
00:35:18.027 --> 00:35:19.756
هل سمعتما هذا، يا رفاق؟

528
00:35:20.529 --> 00:35:21.894
لا يتحرك أحد

529
00:35:35.444 --> 00:35:37.309
أخبرني أن هذا ليس ما أظنه

530
00:35:40.916 --> 00:35:41.974
(موسكوفيت)

531
00:35:42.351 --> 00:35:43.375
(موسكوفيت)

532
00:35:43.552 --> 00:35:45.486
وما هو (موسكوفيت)؟

533
00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:51.551
إنه نوع رقيق من تكوينات الصخور -
ما مدى رقته؟ -

534
00:35:51.727 --> 00:35:55.424
حسناً، رقيق جدأ لدرجة أن أقل تغير
... في الوزن أو الضغط

535
00:35:55.598 --> 00:35:58.260
يمكن أن يجعله يتحطم ...

536
00:35:58.701 --> 00:36:00.692
ونحن نقف فوق الكثير منه

537
00:36:02.338 --> 00:36:03.362
!فقط توقف، توقف

538
00:36:07.243 --> 00:36:08.267
حسناً، لقد توقفت التشققات

539
00:36:09.879 --> 00:36:12.404
أريدك أن تمشي للخلف
من نفس الطريق الذي جئنا منه

540
00:36:12.581 --> 00:36:13.775
بهدوء شديد جداً جداً، اتفقنا؟

541
00:36:15.117 --> 00:36:16.277
دُس برقة

542
00:36:16.452 --> 00:36:18.443
الكعب، الأصبع، أنت تحسن صنعاً

543
00:36:18.621 --> 00:36:20.987
رائع، ببطء شديد

544
00:36:21.156 --> 00:36:23.215
حسن، هيا

545
00:36:28.998 --> 00:36:30.192
هكذا

546
00:36:31.634 --> 00:36:32.760
عظيم

547
00:36:32.935 --> 00:36:34.232
بحرص شديد -
استمر -

548
00:36:36.105 --> 00:36:37.732
!لا

549
00:36:51.587 --> 00:36:53.316
إنه في الحقيقة أسمك مما ظننت

!ما زلنا نسقط

تريفور)، ماذا يوجد في القاع؟)

552
00:37:24.987 --> 00:37:26.818
... حسناً، لو كان ما كتبه (فيرن) صحيحاً

553
00:37:26.989 --> 00:37:29.685
فهذه الأنفاق ربما تمتد لمئات، آلاف من الأميال ...

554
00:37:29.858 --> 00:37:31.155
فيرن) لم يكن على حق)

555
00:37:31.327 --> 00:37:33.158
تريفور)، أكمل كلامك، ماذا يوجد في القاع؟)

556
00:37:33.329 --> 00:37:35.354
النظرية الأكثر احتمالاً أن هذه الأنفاق تنتهي وحسب

557
00:37:35.531 --> 00:37:38.864
تنتهي؟ هل لديك أي نظريات أخرى؟

558
00:37:39.034 --> 00:37:42.026
... حسناً، حوائط هذا النفق قد تكون قد تآكلت برقة

559
00:37:42.204 --> 00:37:44.172
... بفعل الماء الذي ما زال يجري خلالها ...

560
00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:47.434
مما سييجعل سقوطنا يتوقف تدريجياً ...

561
00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:50.511
كنوع من الانزلاق المائي -
الانزلاق المائي -

562
00:37:50.679 --> 00:37:52.078
حسناً، هذه إحدى النظريات

563
00:37:52.247 --> 00:37:56.377
ولكن ألم يكن الماء سيصنع حليمات بارزة نحونا؟

564
00:37:56.552 --> 00:37:58.850
سوف تنغرس بأجسادنا -
هذا ممكن أيضاً -

565
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:16.737
هل هذا ماء؟

566
00:38:16.905 --> 00:38:18.304
نعم، ماء

567
00:38:18.474 --> 00:38:20.169
إنزلاق مائي، إنزلاق مائي

568
00:38:20.342 --> 00:38:22.640
ها هو قادم، تمسَّكا

569
00:39:01.517 --> 00:39:03.576
!(شون)! (شون)

570
00:39:04.086 --> 00:39:06.520
شون)، (شون)، هل أنت بخير؟)

571
00:39:06.689 --> 00:39:08.486
لم تنغرس الأجسام المدببة بأجسدادنا

572
00:39:08.657 --> 00:39:10.591
اتجه للصخور

573
00:39:19.334 --> 00:39:21.234
أين (هانا)؟

574
00:39:21.403 --> 00:39:24.463
!(هانا)! (هانا)

575
00:39:39.054 --> 00:39:40.646
لقد كانت حقيبتي أثقل من اللازم

576
00:40:00.109 --> 00:40:01.804
شكراً

577
00:40:02.377 --> 00:40:04.242
إذن أين أخذنا هذا الشلال الآن؟

578
00:40:07.483 --> 00:40:09.474
أصبحتَ تدين لي بواحدة فقط

579
00:40:13.055 --> 00:40:15.023
يا رفاق، أين نحن؟

580
00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:16.418
هل هذه نجوم؟

581
00:40:23.732 --> 00:40:25.427
لا

582
00:40:25.601 --> 00:40:28.331
إنه مجرد سقف الكهف

583
00:40:28.504 --> 00:40:32.031
... هل هو أنا فقط، أم أن سقف الكهف

584
00:40:33.008 --> 00:40:34.600
يتحرك؟ ...

585
00:40:36.612 --> 00:40:38.273
نعم

586
00:40:38.747 --> 00:40:40.942
... يبدو هذا حقاً

587
00:40:41.116 --> 00:40:42.549
أليس كذلك؟ ...

588
00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:07.172
إنها طيور

589
00:41:09.244 --> 00:41:10.973
طيور كهربية؟

590
00:41:11.146 --> 00:41:13.706
(إنها تشبه (سيانيس روزوبتيريكس

591
00:41:13.882 --> 00:41:18.182
إنها فقط مضيئه مثل اليراع وحشرات سراج الليل

592
00:41:18.353 --> 00:41:19.377
هذا مذهل

593
00:41:30.933 --> 00:41:32.560
جميل

594
00:41:32.734 --> 00:41:34.998
طيور ... متوهجة

595
00:41:45.314 --> 00:41:46.747
هل رأيتَ هذه المخلوقات من قبل؟

596
00:41:46.915 --> 00:41:49.008
نعم، في المتحف ولكنها كانت متحفرة

597
00:41:49.184 --> 00:41:52.415
هذه المخلوقات إنقرضت منذ أكثر
من 150 مليون سنة

598
00:42:05.033 --> 00:42:07.263
إلى أين هي ذاهبة؟
انظروا، نفق

599
00:42:08.237 --> 00:42:09.966

... كلاهما كان يؤمن

609
00:43:09.998 --> 00:43:13.456
بشيء كان الجميع يخبرونهما بأنه مستحيل ...

610
00:43:13.635 --> 00:43:15.626
لقد كان على حق

611
00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:21.103
ما هذا الضوء بأعلى هناك؟ -
لست متأكداً -

612
00:43:21.276 --> 00:43:27.181
لابد وأنه تجمع من غازات مضيئة

613
00:43:27.749 --> 00:43:29.478
لا أعرف

614
00:43:29.651 --> 00:43:32.449
إنه مثل مربى الحيوانات والنباتات اليابس

615
00:43:32.621 --> 00:43:35.852
مربى للكائنات الحية تحت القشرة الأرضية
بآلاف الأميال

616
00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:43.122
عالم داخل عالم

الشلالات التي كان يمكن سماعها"
... منذ وقت طويل وهي تتدفق من بعيد

618

وأنه كان موجوداً؟

623
00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:18.557

ألا يكاد هذا يذهب بعقلك؟

628
00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:53.693
نعم، لقد ذهب عقلي بالفعل

تقريباً نوع من الفطر العملاق

631
00:45:11.887 --> 00:45:14.447
هل هذا يعني أن كل ما في الكتاب حقيقي؟ -
ربما -

632
00:45:14.623 --> 00:45:17.558
والأجزاء الخطرة حقاً؟ -
لقد كنتُ أفكر في ذلك أيضاً -

(اليوم هو عيد ميلاد (شون"

... (طبقاً لدفتر مذكرات (ماكس

نحن هنا في هذا الجيب الهوائي العملاق  ...
المحاط بالحمم البركانية

680
00:51:28.563 --> 00:51:32.192
... وأثناء فترات النشاط الزلزالي الشديد

مثل التي نحن فيها الآن -
هذا صحيح -

00:51:38.606 --> 00:51:40.665
المصهر البركاني المحيط بنا

00:51:40.842 --> 00:51:44.005
يحوِّل هذا المكان إلى ما يشبه الفرن الكبير

هل هذه هو ما حدث لأبي؟

ولكنني يمكنني التعامل مع هذا الأمر، حقاً

ماكس) كان يخطط للهرب)

688
00:52:01.796 --> 00:52:06.460
مذكراته تقول أن درجات الحرارة هنا
يمكن بسهولة أن تصل إلى 200 درجة

689
00:52:06.634 --> 00:52:09.034
والإنسان لا يمكنه أن يتحمل أكثر من 135 درجة

690
00:52:09.204 --> 00:52:11.695
إنها بالفعل 95 درجة -
لقد كانت 82 عندما أتينا هنا -

691
00:52:11.873 --> 00:52:14.205
درجة الحرارة ترتفع بسرعة -
إذن، ماذا نفعل؟ -

692
00:52:14.375 --> 00:52:16.309
(أنا رأيي هو أن نتبع خطة (ماكس

693
00:52:16.478 --> 00:52:18.002
:ها هو ما كتبه

694
00:52:18.179 --> 00:52:20.170
... تحليلي لكلام (فيرن) الأصلي"

695
00:52:20.348 --> 00:52:24.808
يقودني إلى الاعتقاد بأنه على الجانب الآخر ...
... من المحيط شمال موقعي الحالي

696
00:52:24.986 --> 00:52:28.513
يوجد نهر يشبه الينابيع الحارة ...
"يمكن استخدامه للعودة إلى السطح

697
00:52:28.690 --> 00:52:31.090
... لذلك، ما علينا فعله هو أن نعبر هذا المحيط

698
00:52:31.259 --> 00:52:35.320
ونجد الينبوع الحار ثم نركبه ليصعد بنا لأعلى ...

699
00:52:35.497 --> 00:52:36.691
لأعلى يبدو جيداً

700
00:52:36.865 --> 00:52:38.389
الأمر أصعب من هذا قليلاً

701
00:52:38.566 --> 00:52:40.761
يمكن أن ترتفع الحرارة جداً ويتبخر الماء

702
00:52:40.935 --> 00:52:42.630
كم لدينا من الوقت؟

703
00:52:42.804 --> 00:52:44.897
ثمان وأربعون ساعة
اثنان وسبعون على الأكثر

704
00:52:46.341 --> 00:52:47.672
وربما أقل

705
00:52:47.842 --> 00:52:49.935
:حسناً، السؤال هو

706
00:52:50.111 --> 00:52:52.477
ما هي أسرع وسيلة لعبور المحيط؟

707
00:52:52.647 --> 00:52:55.275
من المستحيل أن ندور من حوله
... لأنه لو مشينا على أقدامنا

708
00:52:55.450 --> 00:52:56.712
ليس لدينا وقت

709
00:52:56.885 --> 00:52:58.944
لا يوجد وقت لذلك

710
00:53:01.656 --> 00:53:03.749
كل شيء موجود في الكتاب

711
00:53:09.597 --> 00:53:11.531
هل أنتِ بخير؟

712
00:53:11.699 --> 00:53:13.360
ما أخبار درجة الحرارة؟

713
00:53:13.535 --> 00:53:15.196
إنها مائة درجة

714
00:53:23.044 --> 00:53:26.605
(كل طعامك البحري، يا (شون
يجب أن نحتفظ بقوّتنا

717
00:53:35.156 --> 00:53:37.624
ألا نحتاج لصارية في المنتصف؟

718
00:53:37.792 --> 00:53:39.657
لا، لا نحتاج لها

719
00:53:39.827 --> 00:53:41.988
الرياح التي نحتاجها بأعلى هناك

720
00:53:42.163 --> 00:53:45.564
حرارية، إنها أسرع بكثير مما لدينا بأسفل هنا

721
00:53:49.737 --> 00:53:51.602
أحسنت، أعتقد أن هذا سيفي بالغرض

722
00:53:51.773 --> 00:53:53.934
أنظر، لديّ شيء لك

723
00:53:59.047 --> 00:54:01.481
ما هذا؟ -
إنها بوصلة -

724
00:54:01.649 --> 00:54:02.775
لقد كانت بوصلة أبيك

725
00:54:03.751 --> 00:54:06.379
أنا أتذكر عيد الميلاد الذي أهدتها أمك له فيه

726
00:54:06.554 --> 00:54:11.958
لقد كانت تريد أن تتأكد من أنه سيستطيع
دوماً أن يجد طريق العودة لمنزله

727
00:54:13.194 --> 00:54:17.290
وربما تساعدك أن تجد طريق العودة إليها

728
00:54:22.937 --> 00:54:24.700
(أشكرك، يا (تريفور -
هي لك -

729
00:54:24.872 --> 00:54:26.703
هذا يعني الكثير بالنسبة لي -
وأنا أيضاً -

730
00:54:28.643 --> 00:54:33.080
هناك شيء واحد يجب أن تعرفه
هنا بأسفل، الأقطاب معكوسة

731
00:54:33.247 --> 00:54:35.215
... أقصد أن الشمال جنوب، والجنوب شمال

732
00:54:35.383 --> 00:54:38.614
ونحن يجب أن نتجه للشمال تماماً عبر البحر ...

733
00:54:39.053 --> 00:54:40.486
تقصد، الجنوب

734
00:54:41.389 --> 00:54:42.617
بالضبط

735
00:55:05.246 --> 00:55:07.214
حسناً، لقد بدأت الرياح تملأها

736
00:55:08.016 --> 00:55:10.484
حسناً، امسكها، امسكها بقوة وثبات

737

حسن، حسن، حسن

738
00:55:13.287 --> 00:55:15.346

نعم، استمر في الانطلاق

00:55:45.553 --> 00:55:47.020
أنتما، هل يمكنكما انتظاري؟

747
00:55:47.188 --> 00:55:50.123
حسناً، اركب
هيا، هيا، هيا بنا

748
00:56:06.307 --> 00:56:07.865
لقد عاد

749
00:56:08.042 --> 00:56:09.942
أيها الصغير

750
00:56:15.049 --> 00:56:17.176
هل ترى تلك السحب؟

751
00:56:17.351 --> 00:56:18.716
نعم

752
00:56:18.886 --> 00:56:23.152
التيار يجذبنا في الاتجاه الذي نريد أن نذهب فيه
يجب أن ننزل الشراع

753
00:56:25.293 --> 00:56:27.727
لا يمكننا ذلك
إن درجة الحرارة 109 درجة

754
00:56:27.895 --> 00:56:28.919
ودرجة الحرارة تتزايد

755
00:56:29.097 --> 00:56:31.258
نحتاج إلى كل السرعة التي يمكننا الحصول عليها
دعه مرفوعاً

756
00:56:38.005 --> 00:56:39.495
إنها مجرد عاصفة صغيرة

757
00:56:39.674 --> 00:56:42.142
ليست مشكلة كبيرة

758
00:56:48.649 --> 00:56:50.173
هناك شيء يتحرك بأسفل

759
00:56:51.719 --> 00:56:53.050
متألق ومن العوالق

760
00:56:53.221 --> 00:56:55.280
إنه نفس الشيء الذي رأيناه عند الشاطئ

761
00:56:55.456 --> 00:56:57.651
لا أعرف
يبدو أنه كبير نوعاً ما بالنسبة للعوالق

762
00:56:57.825 --> 00:57:00.760
شون)، نحن لسنا في عالم البحار)
لذلك تراجع قليلاً

763
00:57:00.928 --> 00:57:03.192
اتفقنا؟ -
أعتقد أنه نوع من الأسماك -

764
00:57:14.342 --> 00:57:15.639
!لا

765
00:57:21.816 --> 00:57:22.908

767
00:57:25.353 --> 00:57:26.684
اضرب بشدة

768
00:57:27.455 --> 00:57:29.719
حسناً فلنرى ما حصلنا عليه

769
00:57:31.392 --> 00:57:33.792
نعم، ضربة منخفضة سريعة

770
00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:40.392
!(شون) -
هل تسمع شيئاً؟ -

771
00:57:43.738 --> 00:57:44.864
مرحباً؟ -

772
00:57:45.039 --> 00:57:46.870
أمي؟ -
<i>أعتقد أن الاتصال سيء -</i>

773
00:57:47.041 --> 00:57:48.702
أمي، لا أستطيع سماعكِ

774
00:57:48.876 --> 00:57:50.343

... عمي (تريفور) وأنا

... نحن تقريباً في رحلة صيد ...

777
00:57:57.752 --> 00:57:59.083
<i>هل تستمتع؟</i>

778
00:58:01.856 --> 00:58:03.221
توقف، لا، لا تفعل

779
00:58:03.391 --> 00:58:06.758
عمي (تريفور) اصطاد لتوِّه سمكة كبيرة جداً -
<i>شون)؟) -</i>

780
00:58:07.228 --> 00:58:09.924
هاتفي -
شون)، هل تعرف كيف تضرب ياليد اليسرى؟) -

781
00:58:11.299 --> 00:58:13.529
جاهز؟ -
نعم -

782
00:58:14.602 --> 00:58:15.762
خارج أرض الملعب

783
00:58:15.937 --> 00:58:17.029
(شون) -
!احترس -

784
00:58:17.205 --> 00:58:18.263
أنا أراهم، أنا أراهم

785
00:58:25.613 --> 00:58:26.841
(شون)
لا، لا، لا تفعل ذلك

786
00:58:27.014 --> 00:58:28.948
ابتعدوا عن الجوانب

787
00:58:33.955 --> 00:58:35.081
انظروا ماذا يفعلون

788
00:58:35.623 --> 00:58:37.454
إنهم لا يريدوننا
إنهم يريدون السمك

789
00:58:37.625 --> 00:58:40.924
اسمعا، (شون) امسك أنت بالمقود
ونحن سنمسك بالحبال

790
00:58:41.095 --> 00:58:42.494
هانا)، امسكي بحبال الشراع)

791
00:58:42.663 --> 00:58:44.528
شون)، هل تريد أن تأخذنا يميناً؟)

792
00:58:44.699 --> 00:58:46.166
ماذا؟

793
00:58:46.334 --> 00:58:47.426
من ذاك الطريق

794
00:58:51.439 --> 00:58:52.906
هيا

795
00:58:54.075 --> 00:58:56.771
حسناً -
هذا جيد -

796
00:58:58.279 --> 00:59:00.679
الآن دعيها بهدوء
دعيها تفلت بهدوء

797
00:59:00.848 --> 00:59:02.008
دعيها ببطء

798
00:59:02.183 --> 00:59:03.548
هذا يفلح

799
00:59:03.718 --> 00:59:06.243
نحن نبتعد عنهم

800
00:59:11.092 --> 00:59:12.389
(أنت عظيم، يا عمي (تريف

أيها الصغير، أين نحن؟

817
01:01:35.069 --> 01:01:37.765
قل لي، هل تعرف أين يمكنني الحصول
على بعض الماء؟

818
01:01:38.239 --> 01:01:39.900
أنا أتحدث مع طائر

819
01:01:40.074 --> 01:01:42.201
لابد وأنني بدأت أصاب بالجنون

820
01:01:53.754 --> 01:01:56.279

انتظر

01:02:11.439 --> 01:02:13.805
الرياح قذفت به في هذا الاتجاه

824
01:02:14.975 --> 01:02:17.205
أما زلنا نتجه شمالاً؟

825
01:02:18.679 --> 01:02:20.237
نعم، ما زلنا نتجه نحو الشمال

826
01:02:20.414 --> 01:02:22.382
إنه طفل ذكي، إنه يعرف الخطة

827
01:02:22.550 --> 01:02:25.110
أنا متأكدة أنه سيكون بانتظارنا عند النهر

828

هيا نبحث عن النهر

829

الماء يغلي -
نحتاج شيئاً يطفو -

927
01:16:08.909 --> 01:16:10.501
... أي شيء، يمكنني استخدام كتلة خشبية أو

928
01:16:10.677 --> 01:16:12.872
ما نحتاجه حقاً هو قارب

929
01:16:25.659 --> 01:16:26.819
من الذي كان يطالب بدوره مرة ثانية؟

930
01:16:29.996 --> 01:16:31.020
هيا، اقفزا

931
01:16:31.197 --> 01:16:34.360
إنها أفضل مرشدة جبال على الكوكب كله -
هذا صحيح -

932
01:16:36.970 --> 01:16:39.962
أنتما حقاً لم تكونا تعتقدان أنكما ستفزعانني
أليس كذلك؟

933
01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:42.772
يجب أن تعملا بجد أكثر من هذا

934
01:16:53.019 --> 01:16:55.510
للأسف سوف أتقاضى منك
المزيد من المال على هذا

935
01:16:55.689 --> 01:16:57.884
هل يمكنني أن أفتح لديكِ حساباً؟

936
01:16:59.459 --> 01:17:01.017
ما هذا؟

937
01:17:01.761 --> 01:17:04.525
ليس هذا جيداً، إنه قاع النهر

938
01:17:04.698 --> 01:17:06.495
الماء ينفذ منا

939
01:17:08.068 --> 01:17:10.366
يجب أن تتمسكوا بشيء ما

940
01:17:10.537 --> 01:17:13.836
... هذه الرحلة ستكون إلى حد ما

941
01:17:22.115 --> 01:17:23.810
مليئة بالمطبات

942
01:17:27.253 --> 01:17:28.914
هل الجميع بخير؟ -
نعم -

943
01:17:29.089 --> 01:17:30.989
أين نحن؟

944
01:17:32.792 --> 01:17:34.953
ما هذا الضوء بأسفل هناك؟

945
01:17:35.261 --> 01:17:36.728
إنها الحمم البكانية

946
01:17:37.030 --> 01:17:39.897
إنه المصهر البركاني، إنها ترتفع

947
01:17:40.066 --> 01:17:43.297
المفروض أن يكون هناك ماء في هذا النفق
بخار، ماء يندفع لأعلى

948
01:17:43.470 --> 01:17:45.768
لقد تأخرنا على الينبوع الحار
لم نلحق به

949
01:17:45.939 --> 01:17:48.533
ماذا نفعل؟ -
هل لديك أي اقتراحات، يا بروفيسور؟ -

950
01:17:48.708 --> 01:17:51.734
بدون ماء، لا يوجد بخار
وبدون بخار، لن نذهب إلى اي مكان

951
01:17:51.911 --> 01:17:55.506
هذا المكان يبدو أنه بلا ماء منذ ساعتين أو ثلاثة

952
01:17:55.682 --> 01:17:58.742
ولكن الحوائط ما زالت مبتلة -
هذا مستحيل، درجة الحرار ة 130 -

تريفور)، خلفك) -
ماذا؟ -

954
01:18:03.156 --> 01:18:04.748
إنه مبتل

955
01:18:05.225 --> 01:18:07.750
إنه بارد
هناك ماء خلف هذا

956
01:18:07.927 --> 01:18:10.828
يجب أن يكون هناك ماء
خلف الجيب الهوائي أو خلف النهر الجوفي

957
01:18:10.997 --> 01:18:12.294
تريفور)، إنها تقترب)

958
01:18:13.099 --> 01:18:16.091
أنظروا، إنه ماغنيسيوم

959
01:18:19.372 --> 01:18:21.533
إننا ننزلق -
كم طلقة مضيئة بقيت معكِ؟ -

960
01:18:26.746 --> 01:18:28.475
ثلاثة
ماذا تريد أن تفعل بهم؟

961
01:18:28.648 --> 01:18:30.479
سوف نشعل الماغنيسيوم
عمداً

962
01:18:32.452 --> 01:18:34.044
انتظرا

963
01:18:38.158 --> 01:18:40.422
!يا إلهي، إنه مبتلّ أكثر من اللازم

964
01:18:44.964 --> 01:18:47.262
يجب أن أهبط لأسفل أكثر
أعطيني واحدة أخرى

965
01:18:49.235 --> 01:18:50.998
امسكوا بساقيَّ

966
01:18:55.775 --> 01:18:57.333
هيا

967
01:19:02.148 --> 01:19:05.015
ستضطرون إلى ربطي بحبل

تريفور)، إنها تقترب)

969
01:19:08.288 --> 01:19:09.983
هذا جيد، حسناً، استعدوا

970
01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:15.455
إنها الأخيرة

01:19:31.945 --> 01:19:33.378
!تريفور)، احترس)

972
01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:38.508
ما رأيك في هذا؟ -
أكثر قليلاً -

973
01:19:38.685 --> 01:19:40.209
أسرعي

974
01:19:43.957 --> 01:19:46.152
لأسفل أكثر؟ -
أكثر قليلاً -

975
01:19:46.793 --> 01:19:47.953
حسناً، توقفي

976
01:19:49.129 --> 01:19:51.290

ما زالت مبتلة، سنضطر إلى قذفها للجانب الآخر

980
01:20:18.191 --> 01:20:19.624
ماذا؟

981
01:20:20.093 --> 01:20:21.185
لا

982
01:20:21.361 --> 01:20:22.919
!لا

!شون)! هيا)

991
01:20:45.051 --> 01:20:46.279
انخفضوا، سوف تنفجر

992
01:20:58.865 --> 01:21:00.093
هذا الشيء تزداد حرارته

993
01:21:00.266 --> 01:21:01.858
!أعرف

994
01:21:10.143 --> 01:21:13.112
!تمسكوا -
!صدقني، أنا أتمسك -

!تمسكوا، جميعاً

(قل لها أن عمي (تريفور) أخذني إلى (إيطاليا ... -
إيطاليا)؟) -

شون)؟)

1003
01:22:58.284 --> 01:23:00.343
ماذا؟ لقد أخذتُ فقط بعض العينات الجيولوجية

1004
01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:02.078
بعض العينات الجيولوجية؟

1005
01:23:02.255 --> 01:23:05.713
بعض الأرطال من العينات؟ ولكن ماذا تتوقع؟
أنا ابن عالِم

1006
01:23:08.061 --> 01:23:10.188
أنظر، أنظر

1007
01:23:10.363 --> 01:23:12.888
خذ أنت هذا

1008
01:23:13.066 --> 01:23:16.229
خذ أنت، نحن آسفون

1009
01:23:22.475 --> 01:23:25.342
أتريدون الانزلاق مرة أخرى؟

1010
01:23:26.279 --> 01:23:28.008
الانزلاق جيد، إنه جيد

1011
01:23:28.181 --> 01:23:30.445
كل ما تريده

1012
01:23:39.592 --> 01:23:41.219
لماذا كان هذا؟

1013
01:23:41.394 --> 01:23:43.419
الآن، نحن متعادلان

1014

ليونارد)، لقد عدتُ)
توقف عما تفعله

1015
01:23:59.979 --> 01:24:01.913
وما الذي أفعله؟

1016
01:24:02.081 --> 01:24:03.878
أنظر
أنت تبحث عن عمل

1017
01:24:04.050 --> 01:24:06.245
... لا داعي لذلك لأنك لديك وظيفة

1018
01:24:06.419 --> 01:24:10.048
(في معهد (أسجيرسون آندرسون
للاستكشاف التكتونوفيزيقي

1019
01:24:10.223 --> 01:24:12.555
أسجيرسون آندرسون) ... ماذا؟)

1020
01:24:12.725 --> 01:24:14.215
ما زلتُ أبحث عن إسم جيد

1021
01:24:14.394 --> 01:24:16.828
ولكن المهم هو
أن المد يرفع كل القوارب

1022
01:24:16.996 --> 01:24:18.623
يا رجل، هذا رائع

1023
01:24:18.798 --> 01:24:20.959
أعتقد .. هل أنا قارب؟

1024
01:24:21.134 --> 01:24:24.035
أنت قارب، سنعود للعمل -
حسناً، يا صديقي -

1025
01:24:24.203 --> 01:24:26.728
حسناً، حسناً، حسناً
علام كل هذه الإثارة؟

1026
01:24:26.906 --> 01:24:28.567
يا (آلان)، كيف حالك؟ -
بخير -

1027
01:24:28.741 --> 01:24:30.333
ماذا تفعل؟ -
أنا؟ -

1028
01:24:30.510 --> 01:24:33.001
أنا أنتقل إلى معملي الجديد

1029
01:24:33.379 --> 01:24:35.142
الأهم هو، أين كنتم؟

1030
01:24:35.314 --> 01:24:39.148
سمعت أنك فوّت محاضرة يوم الإثنين
وكل طلابك قدم شكوى

1031
01:24:39.318 --> 01:24:40.307


1032
01:24:41.654 --> 01:24:44.054
لقد كنتُ في أجازة سريعة
أفضل ما قمتُ به

1033
01:24:44.223 --> 01:24:45.281
هذا مثير

1034
01:24:45.458 --> 01:24:47.722
ستعدني أن تحكي لي عنها، اتفقنا؟

1035
01:24:47.894 --> 01:24:52.058
لستُ متأكداً إن كان لدي وقت
(ولكن يمكنك أن تقرأ عنها مجلة (ساينتيفيك أميريكان

1036
01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:55.692
ساينتيفيك أميريكان)؟)

1037
01:24:55.868 --> 01:24:58.393
أنظر، أود فقط أن أقول لا داعي
لأن تحمل لي ضغينة، اتفقنا؟

1038
01:24:58.571 --> 01:25:00.937
بشأن نقل المعمل وموضوع التوسع هذا

1039
01:25:01.107 --> 01:25:03.598
أنا في الحقيقة أبحث عن مبنى خاص بي على أية حال

1040
01:25:03.776 --> 01:25:06.609
كيف ستفعل هذا بالضبط، يا (تريفور)؟

1041
01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:09.846
حسناً، فلنقل أنني سقطتُ على ثروة صغيرة

1042
01:25:12.585 --> 01:25:14.610
إذن غداً سوف تصبح كندياً

1043
01:25:14.787 --> 01:25:17.085
نعم، يبدو هذا

1044
01:25:22.161 --> 01:25:25.858
سأقول أنه قد حدث بيننا ترابط رجولي قوي
في وقت قصير جداً

1045
01:25:26.032 --> 01:25:29.399
ما رأيك أن نأخذ بضعة أسابيع في المرة القادمة؟

1046
01:25:29.569 --> 01:25:31.036
عدة أسابيع؟

1047
01:25:31.204 --> 01:25:33.672
ماذا ستفعل في أجازة الكريسماس؟ -
لا شيء، أنا غير مشغول -

1048
01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:35.967
لقد وجدتُ هذه في أشياء أبيك

1049
01:25:36.843 --> 01:25:38.003
اقرأها

1050
01:25:38.177 --> 01:25:40.168
مدينة (أتلانتيس) المفقودة

1051
01:25:40.346 --> 01:25:41.904

1053
01:25:46.786 --> 01:25:48.879
أنا فقط أُطعم حيواني المدلل -
أي حيوان؟ -

01:25:49.055 --> 01:25:51.023
(شون)

1055
01:25:51.324 --> 01:25:53.815
هل تعتقد أن أمي ستسمح لي بالاحتفاظ به؟ -
لا أعرف -

1056
01:25:53.993 --> 01:25:56.086
ربما حتى لا يبقى هنا

1057
01:25:56.262 --> 01:25:58.059
أنظر إليه -
أنت، هيا -

1058
01:25:58.231 --> 01:26:00.426
هذه هي مشكلتك -
إلى أين أنت ذاهب؟ -

1059
01:26:00.900 --> 01:26:03.807
