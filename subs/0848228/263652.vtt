00:31:43,979 --> 00:31:47,315
Good day to you.

2
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:49,192
What do you want?

3
00:31:56,283 --> 00:31:58,785
Boy, get in here now!

4
00:32:03,248 --> 00:32:05,125
What took you so long?

5
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:07,502
I was cleaning the fan switches.

6
00:32:07,586 --> 00:32:09,838
Watch the store.
I've got some selling to do.

7
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:08,308
Outlanders. They think we know nothing.

8
00:35:08,433 --> 00:35:10,352
They seemed nice to me.

9
00:35:10,435 --> 00:35:12,396
Clean the racks.

10
00:35:12,479 --> 00:35:13,730
Then you can go home.

11
00:36:00,944 --> 00:36:04,364
Hey, hey!
Are you going to pay for that?

12
00:36:04,489 --> 00:36:06,283
Huh? Wanga?

13
00:36:06,366 --> 00:36:08,243
It costs seven wupiupi.

14
00:36:18,837 --> 00:36:21,339
Is this yours?

15
00:36:27,304 --> 00:36:29,431
Careful, Sebulba.

16
00:36:29,514 --> 00:36:31,683
He's a big-time outlander.

17
00:36:31,808 --> 00:36:35,228
I'd hate to see you diced
before we race again.

18
00:36:35,354 --> 00:36:38,523
Next time we race, boy,
it will be the end of you.

19
00:36:38,607 --> 00:36:42,402
If you weren't a slave,
I'd squash you now.

20
00:36:42,527 --> 00:36:45,530
Yeah, it'd be a pity
if you had to pay for me.

21
00:46:06,883 --> 00:46:11,596
Your friend is a foolish one, methinks.

22
00:48:09,715 --> 00:48:12,551
You're such a joker, Ani.

23
00:54:04,611 --> 00:54:07,197
Better stop your friend's betting,

24
00:54:07,322 --> 00:54:10,909
or I'll end up owning him too.

25
00:57:23,977 --> 00:57:26,772
You won't walk away from this one,

26
00:57:26,897 --> 00:57:29,149
you slave scum.

27
00:57:29,274 --> 00:57:32,527
Don't count on it, slime ball.

28
00:57:32,611 --> 00:57:34,780
You're bantha fodder!

29
00:58:19,199 --> 00:58:22,911
Welcome.

30
00:58:24,955 --> 00:58:28,041
Begin the race!
