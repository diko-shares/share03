宇宙魔方已经觉醒了
The Tesseract has awakened.

10
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.870
它在一个小小的空间里 人类的世界里
It is on a little world, a human world.

11
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.910
人类试图控制它运用它
They would wield its power,

12
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.960
可惜只有我们的盟友 才知道如何掌握魔方的秘密
but our ally knows its workings as they never will.

13
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.590
让盟友去做开路先锋吧
He is ready to lead

14
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.220
我们齐塔瑞人将紧随其后
and our force, our Chitauri, will follow.

15
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.220
这个星球可以归他所有
A world will be his.

16
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.560

情况有多糟
How bad is it?

29
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.290
最糟的是 长官 不知道情况
That's the problem, sir. We don't know.

30
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.790
四小时前席尔维格博士 检测到魔方发出了一股能量
Dr Selvig read an energy surge from the Tesseract four hours ago.

31
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.800
航天局没授权博士进行测试
NASA didn't authorise Selvig to go to test phase.

32
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.170
他没进行测试 他根本就不在房间
He wasn't testing it. He wasn't even in the room.

33
00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.380
是自动触发的
Spontaneous event.

34
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:19.680
它就这么自己激活了
It just turned itself on?

35
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:20.930
能量现在什么水平
Where are the energy levels now?

36
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.310
上升中 确定博士无法关闭之后 我们下令撤离了
Climbing. When Selvig couldn't shut it down, we ordered evac.

半个小时就可以清场了
Campus should be clear in the next half-hour.

39
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.730
抓紧点
Do better.

40
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.650
长官 撤离也许是没用的
Sir, evacuation may be futile.

41
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.230
难道让他们回去睡大觉
We should tell them to go back to sleep?

42
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.650
如果我们不能控制宇宙魔方的能量
If we can't control the Tesseract's energy,

43
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.190
我认为躲到任何地方都是没用的
there may not be a minimum safe distance.

44
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.360
我要你确保
I need you to make sure

45

第2阶段原型机能安全转移
the Phase 2 prototypes are shipped out.

Director.

59
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.510
告诉我现在是什么情况
Is there anything we know for certain?

60
00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.970
宇宙魔方不太正经
The Tesseract is misbehaving.

61
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.580
是开玩笑的时候吗
Is that supposed to be funny?

62
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:08.980
不是开玩笑
No, it's not funny at all.

63
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.690
宇宙魔方不仅活跃 而且 我行我素
The Tesseract is not only active, she's behaving.

64
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:13.900
你没拔了插头试试
I assume you pulled the plug.

65
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.820
它本身就是个能量源
She's an energy source.

66
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.070
我们关闭电源 它自己又打开了
We turn off the power, she turns it back on.

67
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.360
如果让它达到峰值
If she reaches peak level...

68
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.990
那不正是我们的目的吗 从宇宙中汲取能量
We prepa red for this, Doctor. Harnessing energy from space.

69
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.580
我们还没有做好准备
But we don't have the harness.

70
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.990
我的计算还需要一段时间
My calculations are far from complete.

71
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.080
它在不停地发射干扰和放射物
And she's throwing off interference, radiation.

72
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.000
倒没有什么害处 是非常低的伽马射线
Nothing harmful, low levels of gamma radiation.

73
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.750
还是会有害处的
That can be harmful.

80
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.470
我给你的任务
I gave you this detail

81
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.180
是仔细观察瞭望 巴顿
so you could keep a close eye on things.

82
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.770
只有站得高才能看得远
Well, I see better from a distance.

83
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.940
看到是什么东西激活了它吗
Have you seen anything that might set this thing off?

84
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:53.720
博士 又一次脉冲
Doctor, it's spiking again.

85

席尔维格博士是清白的
And Selvig's clean.

89
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.440
没任何接触 也没信息
No contacts, no IMs.

90
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.740
有问题的话 也不会出在我们这边
If there was any tampering, sir, it wasn't at this end.

91
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.030
我们这边
"At this end"?

92
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.080
是啊 魔方是通向宇宙另一边的一扇门 对吧
Yeah, the Cube is a doorway to the other end of space, right?

93
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.210
这门应该两边都能开
Doors open from both sides.

94
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.290

Not yet.

把箱子放下
Please don't.

100

I still need that.

101
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.570

This doesn't have to get any messier.

我们和你们无冤无仇

蚂蚁 和你的鞋也无冤无仇
An ant has no quarrel with a boot.

110

这么说你想踩死我们
Are you planning to step on us?

111
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.840
我其实带来的是一个好消息
I come with glad tidings

112
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.010

牵挂什么
Free from what?

自由
Freedom.

自由是生命中最大的谎言
Freedom is life's great lie.

116
00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:22.730
如果接受了这一点 你的内心
Once you accept that, in your heart,

117
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:29.110
就能得到和平
you will know peace.

118
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.860
你所谓的和平
Yeah, you say "peace,"

119
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:33.910
倒是让我想到了它的反义词
I kind of think you mean the other thing.

120
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.620
头儿 弗瑞指挥官在拖延时间
Sir, Director Fury is stalling.

121
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:38.160
这地方马上就要爆炸了
This place is about to blow

122
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.540

几百米的石堆
He means to bury us.

124
00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:43.880
就像埃及金字塔一样
Like the pharaohs of old.

125
00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.040
他说得对 输送门开始崩溃了
He's right. The portal is collapsing in on itself.

126
00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:48.460
距离完全颠覆 还有两分钟时间
We've got maybe two minutes before this goes critical.

魔方被不明敌人拿走了
The Tesseract is with a hostile force.

很多人还被压在下面
A lot of men still under.

142
00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.670
不知道有多少人能生还
I don't know how many survivors.

143
00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.050
发出紧急命令
Sound a general call.

144
00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.970
集合所有没有参与救援的人
I want every living soul not working rescue

145
00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:23.100

Roger that.

147

科尔森 你回基地 发出七级警报
Coulson, get back to base. This is a Level Seven.

168
00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:30.620
我们需要经过他的允许
we have to go through him

169
00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:32.370
才能运我们的那批货
to move our cargo?

我还以为是索罗霍布将军 负责出口的生意
I thought General Solohob is in charge of the export business.

索罗霍布

172
00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:42.720

176
00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:03.780
你真的觉得我漂亮吗
You really think I'm pretty?

177
00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.580
告诉勒曼托夫我们不需要他
Tell Lermentov we don't need him

178

我们自己就能搞定

他现在已经出局了
Tell him he is out.

180

Well...

181
00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.710

189

208

现在我们需要你找那家伙谈谈

他连眼睛都睁不开
but his eyes won't open.

222
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:52.110
慢慢说
Slow down.

223
00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:54.740
我爸爸
My father...

224
00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:58.120
像他们一样
Like them?

225
00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:03.380
求求你
Please.

226
00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:32.860
我应该先收她的钱
You should've got paid up front, Banner.

227
00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:35.780
对于一个需要躲避压力的人来说
You know, for a man who's supposed to be avoiding stress

228
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:39.240
你倒是挑了一个好地方
you picked a hell of a place to settle.

229
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.210
一味地逃避避也不是万能的
Avoiding stress isn't the secret.

230
00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.920
那什么才行 瑜珈
Then what is it? Yoga?

231
00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:50.260
你把我引到偏僻的郊区来 很聪明
You brought me to the edge of the city. Smart.

232
00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:54.890
我估计这个地方已经被包围了吧
I assume the whole place is surrounded.

233
00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:56.720
只有你和我
Just you and me.

234
00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:00.020
那那个小女孩呢
And your actress buddy?

235
00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:02.180
也是特工吗 入行够早的
Is she a spy, too? They start that young?

I did.

237
00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:05.100
你是谁
Who are you?

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:06.440
娜塔莎·罗曼诺夫
Natasha Romanoff.

239
00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:11.110
你是来杀我的吗
Are you here to kill me, Ms Romanoff?

240
00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:14.030
老实说恐怕能杀我的人 还没生呢
Because that's not going to work out for everyone.

241
00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.700
不不 当然不是 我是代表神盾局来找你的
No, of course not. I'm here on behalf of S.H.I.E.L.D.

242
00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:19.950
神盾局
S.H.I.E.L.D.

243
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:22.750
怎么发现我的
How did they find me?

244
00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:24.540
我们一直在关注你 博士
We never lost you, Doctor.

245
00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:25.750
但是保持着距离
We've kept our distance.

246
00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.750
甚至暗地里把一些对你感兴趣的人
Even helped keep some other interested parties

247
00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:28.960
挡了下来
off your scent.

248
00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:30.460
为什么
Why?

249
00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:32.970
尼克·弗瑞好像很信任你
Nick Fury seems to trust you.

250
00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:34.800
不过你得和我走一趟
But now we need you to come in.

251
00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:37.640
如果我拒绝呢
What if I say no?

252
00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:39.970
我会说服你的
I'll persuade you.

253
00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:46.440
如果我身体里的  另一个我拒绝呢
And what if the other guy says no?

254
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:48.770
你一年多都没出现变化了
You've been more than a year without an incident.

255
00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:51.570
这会儿我希望你能保持下去
I don't think you want to break that streak.

256
00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:56.410
不见得我每次都能HOLD住
Well, I don't every time get what I want.

257
00:17:57.450 --> 00:17:59.660
博士 我们现在面临一场全球性的灾难
Doctor, we're facing a potential global catastrophe.

258
00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:03.620
我倒是一直都想远离灾难呢
Well, those I actively try to avoid.

259
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:06.000
这个
This

260
00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:08.580
叫做宇宙魔方
is the Tesseract.

261
00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:11.590
这东西有着摧毁地球的能量
It has the potential energy to wipe out the planet.

262
00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:16.590
弗瑞想要我干什么 吃了它
What does Fury want me to do, swallow it?

263
00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.260
他希望你能找到它 魔方被抢了
He wants you to find it. It's been taken.

264
00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:24.270
目前它散发的伽马射线太微弱 我们追踪不到
It emits a gamma signature that's too weak for us to trace.

265
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:27.390
没人比你更了解伽马射线
There's no one that knows gamma radiation like you do.

266
00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:30.400
所以 弗瑞派我来找你谈谈
If there was, that's where I'd be.

267
00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:33.150
这么说你们不是来抓怪物的
So, Fury isn't after the monster?

268
00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:34.610
至少他没这么说
Not that he's told me.

269
00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:36.990
他什么都跟你说吗
And he tells you everything?

270
00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:39.030
你直接问他 他现在需要你
Talk to Fury. He needs you on this.

271
00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.200
需要把我关在笼子里
He needs me in a cage?

272
00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.330
没人会把你
No one's going to put you in a...

273
00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:42.490
别再骗我了
Stop lying to me!

274
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:49.330
很抱歉 我失态了
I'm sorry. That was mean.

275
00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:52.460
我只是想看看你的反应
I just wanted to see what you'd do.

276
00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:56.630
我们最好还是都冷静点
Why don't we do this the easy way

277
00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:58.090
你把那个东西收起来
where you don't use that

278
00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:02.220
然后 另一个我 也不会出来捣乱
and the other guy doesn't make a mess.

279
00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:04.310
好吗
Okay?

280
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:06.640
娜塔莎
Natasha?

281
00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:13.360
别过来
Stand down.

282
00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.860
一切正常
We're good here.

283
00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:19.240
只有你和我
"Just you and me."

284
00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:23.990
你这是在玩火 指挥官
This is out of line, Director.

285
00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.620
这不是你所能控制的力量
You're dealing with forces you can't control.

286
00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:30.500
打过仗吗 议员阁下 真正的战争
You ever been in a war, Councilman? In a firefight?

287
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:33.500
在战斗的时候你喜欢被人控制吗
Did you feel an overabundance of control?

288
00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:37.090
你是说 神域向我们地球宣战了
You're saying that this Asgard is declaring war on our planet?

289
00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:39.840
我不是说神域 是洛基
Not Asgard. Loki.

290
00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:42.850
他不会是一个人 那家伙呢
He can't be working alone. What about the other one?

291
00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:44.010
他的兄弟
His brother.

292
00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:46.180
我们的情报显示 索尔没有恶意
Our intelligence says Thor is not a hostile

293
00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:47.390
但他远在天边
but he's worlds away.

294
00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.350
指望不上他来帮我们
We can't depend on him to help, either.

295
00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.480
只能靠我们自己
It's up to us.

296
00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:53.230
你更应该把精力 放在第2阶段的工作上
Which is why you should be focusing on Phase 2.

297
00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.690
第2阶段就是为了应付这种
It was designed for exactly this...

298
00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:58.070
第2阶段还不成熟 敌人却不同
Phase 2 isn't ready. Our enemy is.

299
00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.860
我们需要一个应对小组
We need a response team.

300
00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:02.360
复仇者方案已经被终止了
The Avengers Initiative was shut down.

301
00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:04.370
我没强调是复仇者
This isn't about the Avengers.

302
00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:05.700
我们看过名单
We've seen the list.

303
00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:08.120
你掌控着全球最精锐的秘密特工组织
You're running the world's greatest covert security network

304
00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:09.870
你打算把人类的存亡
and you're going to leave the fate of the human race

305
00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.290
交到一帮怪胎的手上吗
to a handful of freaks.

306

哦 我想我永远不会知道

不 应该是 源于这里

最多加到15%
An argument can be made for 15.

395
00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:11.590
孩子只有我12%
12%? My baby?

396
00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:13.380
至少我干的可都是力气活
Well, I did do all the heavy lifting.

397
00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:15.390
确切地说 我出的汗比你多
Literally, I lifted the heavy things.

398
00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.890
哦 还有 安保的那些漏洞怎么说
And, sorry, but the security snafu?

399

That was on you.

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:20.730
我的私人电梯
My private elevator...

401
00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:21.730

I'm going to pay for that comment about percentages

404

温柔地补偿怎么样
in some subtle way later, aren't I?

405
00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:30.980
恐怕不会太温柔
It's not going to be that subtle.

406
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:32.490
我现在宣布
I'll tell you what.

I can't stay.

422
00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:02.180
我还以为他就叫特工呢
His first name is "Agent".

423
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:04.020
进来吧 我们正在庆祝呢
Come on in. We're celebrating.

424
00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:06.020

Which is why he can't stay.

425
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:08.190
请尽快看一下这个 非常紧急
We need you to look this over as soon as possible.

432
00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:21.240
这可不是咨询
This isn't a consultation.

433
00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:22.620
和复仇者有关
Is this about the Avengers?

434
00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:24.870
我可什么都不知道
Which I know nothing about.

435
00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.620
我以为复仇者方案已经作废了呢
The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought.

436
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:29.210
而且我也不够入会的标准
And I didn't even qualify.

437
00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:30.420
这我也不知道
I didn't know that either.

438
00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:33.460
因为我这个人反复无常 极度自我
Apparently I'm volatile, self-obsessed,

439
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:34.840
而且还很不合群
don't play well with others.

440
00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:36.130
这我倒知道
That I did know.

441
00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:37.890
现在和个性已经没有关系了
This isn't about personality profiles any more.

442
00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:40.390
无所谓 波兹小姐 过来一下
Whatever. Ms Potts, got a second?

443
00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:41.600
等一会儿
Half a mo.

444
00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:49.230
你看 我以为 能过二人世界呢

我们过了12%的了
I was having 12% of a moment.

446
00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:54.690
看起来很严重 菲尔显得很紧张

你怎么知道很 你怎么叫他菲尔
How would you know if it's... Why is he "Phil"?

448
00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:58.820
这些是什么
What is all this?

449
00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:00.570

This is

450
00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:02.280

455
00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:18.510
- 你要是不做  - 是啊
- If you didn't? - Yeah.

456
00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.890
你是说等你忙完了
You mean when you've finished?

457
00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:25.270
好吧 嗯 再说
Well, then...

458
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.770
到时候见 一路顺风
Square deal. Fly safe.

459
00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:37.110
加油
Work hard.

460
00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:41.740
去机场你顺路吗
So, any chance you're driving by LaGuardia?

461
00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:43.000
我可以捎你
I can drop you.

462
00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:44.700
这太好了
Fantastic.

463
00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:46.590
嗯 说说那个拉大提琴的
I want to hear about the cellist.

464
00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:47.620
你们还有戏吗
Is that still a thing?

465
00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:48.960
搬回波特兰去了
She moved back to Portland.

466
00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:52.290
真的 哦
What? Boo!

467
00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:56.690
大西洋 某处
Atlantic Ocean Somewere

468
00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:56.690
一

469
00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:56.690
名称：昆式喷气机（Quinjet）
资料：有史以来最强大的运输与攻击载具，采用了
史塔克工业的最新技术与数十种神盾局的先进系统。

470
00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:02.760
我们大概40分钟后抵达总部
We're about 40 minutes out from home base, sir.

471
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:10.140
这么说班纳博士 打算复制他们在我身上用过的血清吗
So, this Dr Banner was trying to replicate the serum they used on me?

472
00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:11.900
很多人这么想
A lot of people were.

473
00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:13.730
你是历史上第一个超级英雄
You were the world's first superhero.

474
00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:17.150
班纳认为伽马射线 会是解开艾斯凯恩博士
Banner thought gamma radiation might hold the key to unlocking

475
00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:18.650
原始配方的关键
Erskine's original formula.

476
00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:21.070
但是他并没有如愿
Didn't really go his way, did it?

477
00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:22.950
可以这么说
Not so much.

478
00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.990
他不变身的时候 和史蒂芬·霍金差不多
When he's not that thing, though, the guy's like a Stephen Hawking.

479
00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.580
他是个绝顶的天才
He's like a smart person.

480
00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:33.830
说实话
I gotta say,

481
00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:36.590
见到你是我的荣幸 是真的
it's an honour to meet you officially.

482
00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:40.800
其实我见过你 是在你昏睡的时候
I've sort of met you. I mean, I watched you while you were sleeping.

483
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:48.350
当时你从冰里 被弄出来的时候 我正好在场
I mean, I was present while you were unconscious from the ice.

484
00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:52.940
没想到 这次你能加入我们 我  真的是太荣幸了
You know, it's really just a huge honour to have you on board this...

485
00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:55.190
但愿我不会让你们失望
I hope I'm the man for the job.

486
00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:58.280
你行 你肯定行
Oh, you are. Absolutely.

487
00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:01.360
嗯 我们改良了一下你的制服 在不影响活动的基础上
We made some modifications to the uniform.

488
00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:03.070
加了一点  新的元素
I had a little design input.

489
00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:04.530
我的制服
The uniform?

490
00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:07.240
那些星星和条纹是不是
Aren't the stars and stripes a little

491
00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:09.750
显得老套
old-fashioned?

492
00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:12.750
在目前的局势下
With everything that's happening

493
00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.580
考虑到即将发生的事
and the things that are about to come to light,

494
00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:18.920
我觉得大家可能 需要一些老办法
people might just need a little old-fashioned.

495
00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:25.920
德国 某地
Germany Somewhere

496
00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:54.410
齐塔瑞人开始不安稳了
The Chitauri grow restless.

497
00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:56.330
让他们做好准备
Let them gird themselves.

498
00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:58.250
我会带他们打一场光荣的战争
I will lead them in the glorious battle.

499
00:29:58.460 --> 00:29:59.630
战争
Battle?

500
00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:03.550
对那些弱小的地球人
Against the meagre might of Earth?

501
00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:06.590
光荣 但不会漫长
Glorious, not lengthy.

502
00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:10.600
只要你的军队真的有你说的那么强大
If your force is as formidable as you claim.

503
00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:13.310
你在质疑我们吗
You question us?

504
00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:15.640
质疑这个
You question him,

505
00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:18.270
把权杖交到你手上的人
he who put the sceptre in your hand?

506
00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:21.400
他赋予你远古的知识以及新的理想
Who gave you ancient knowledge and new purpose

507
00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:24.490
当时你可是被打败了
when you were cast out, defeated?

508
00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:26.570
我才是一国之君
I was a king!

509
00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:28.990
是神域的绝对君主
The rightful king of Asgard,

510
00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:30.490
我遭到背叛
betrayed.

511
00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:33.790
你的那点志向微不足道
Your ambition is little

512
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.750
充满孩子气
and born of childish need.

513
00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.960
我们的目光不止是地球
We look beyond the Earth

514
00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:42.130
而是宇宙魔方将要展现的更广阔的世界
to the greater worlds the Tesseract will unveil.

515
00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:44.010
你还没得到宇宙魔方
You don't have the Tesseract yet.

516
00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:47.800
我不是威胁你
I don't threaten.

517
00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:51.930
在我打开那些门之前
But until I open the doors,

518
00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:55.770
在我统领你的军队之前你的承诺
until your force is mine to command,

519
00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:58.310
都是空话
you are but words.

520
00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:02.480
去打你的仗吧 神域人
You will have your war, Asgardian.

521
00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:06.280
等你失败了
If you fail,

522
00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:11.660
宇宙魔方没有到我们的手里
if the Tesseract is kept from us,

523
00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:16.250
那你就别指望你的王国了 也没有供你栖身的角落
there will be no realm, no barren moon,

524
00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:19.750
无论你躲到哪儿他都能找到你
no crevice where he cannot find you.

525
00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:24.090
他会让你哀嚎
You think you know pain?

526
00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:29.970
让你知道 什么才是真正的痛不欲生
He will make you long for something sweet as pain.

527
00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:00.210
把队长的装备收好
Stow the captain's gear.

528
00:32:00.330 --> 00:32:01.330
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

529
00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:06.000
罗曼诺夫特工 罗杰斯上尉
Agent Romanoff, Captain Rogers.

530
00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:07.510
- 你好 - 你好
- Ma'am. - Hi.

531
00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:08.670
你得去舰桥
They need you on the bridge.

532
00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:10.300
他们开始定位追踪了
They're starting the face-trace.

533
00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:11.590
一会儿见
See you there.

534
00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:17.470
你在这儿可算是个风云人物了
It was quite the buzz around here, finding you in the ice.

535
00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:20.350
我以为科尔森见到你会晕过去
I thought Coulson was gonna swoon.

536
00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:23.440
他是不是让你在他的珍藏品上签名
Did he ask you to sign his Captain America trading cards yet?

537
00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:24.860
珍藏品
Trading cards?

538
00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:27.230
那可是他引以为豪的宝贝
They're vintage. He's very proud.

539
00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:30.280
班纳博士
Dr Banner.

540
00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:33.570
哦 天呐 你好
Yeah, hi.

541
00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:35.330
他们说了你会来
They told me you would be coming.

542
00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:36.830
听说你能找到魔方
Word is, you can find the Cube.

543
00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:39.750
你 就只听这么多吗
Is that the only word on me?

544
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.330
我只关心这么多
Only word I care about.

545
00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:46.500
你会觉得这一切 都很新奇
It must be strange for you, all of this.

546
00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:49.880
哦 其实倒是觉得似曾相识
Well, this is actually kind of familiar.

547
00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:52.680
先生们 你们最好还是赶快进去
Gentlemen, you might want to step inside in a minute.

548
00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:55.640
外面一会儿就会无法呼吸了
It's going to get a little hard to breathe.

549
00:32:56.890 --> 00:32:58.430
飞行机组 清理甲板
Flight crew, secure the deck.

550
00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:04.520
这是艘潜艇吗
Is this a submarine?

551
00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:06.060
看来
Really?

552
00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:09.940
他们想把我关在一个深藏在水底 不透气的铁罐子里
They want me in a submerged, pressurised, metal container?

553
00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:38.720
不 不 情况好像更糟
No, no, this is much worse.

554
00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:45.720
一

555
00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:45.720
名称：天空母舰（Helicarrier）
资料：神盾局拥有的具备海中航行及空中飞行功能

556
00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:11.700
检查完毕 准备启航 一切就绪

557
00:34:11.910 --> 00:34:14.320
将动力输出升至8%

558
00:34:18.970 --> 00:34:20.650
功率输出最大值
Preparing for maximum performance takeoff.

559
00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:21.890
准备上升
Increase output to capacity.

560
00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:25.190
注意 动力已经全部开启
Power plant performing at capacity.

561
00:34:25.390 --> 00:34:26.850
一切就绪
We are clear.

562
00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:28.560
所有引擎运转正常
All engines operating.

563
00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:33.400
神盾局紧急程序193.6已启动
S.H.I.E.L.D. Emergency Protocol 193.6 in effect.

564
00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:35.200
到达预定标度 长官
We are at level, sir.

565
00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:36.200
很好
Good.

566
00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:37.570
人间蒸发吧
Let's vanish.

567
00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:40.200
启动背景反射面板
Engage retro-reflection panels.

568
00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:57.130
背景反射面板已启动
Reflection panels engaged.

569
00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:59.140
先生们
Gentlemen.

570
00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:12.610
感谢你能来 博士
Doctor, thank you for coming.

571
00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:16.490
谢谢你的盛情邀请
Thanks for asking nicely.

572
00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:19.320
那么 打算让我待多久
So, how long am I staying?

573
00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:21.330
等我们找到了宇宙魔方
Once we get our hands on the Tesseract,

574
00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:22.660
你就可以随便了
you're in the wind.

575
00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:24.620
目前有什么进展吗
Where are you with that?

576
00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:26.580
我们监视着地球上
We're sweeping every wirelessly accessible

577
00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:27.710
每一个无线接入的摄像头
camera on the planet.

578
00:35:28.290 --> 00:35:30.080
手机 笔记本
Cell phones, laptops ...

579
00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:32.350
搜索

580
00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:33.920
只要是联着网的 都会是我们的目标
If it's connected to a satellite, it's eyes and ears for us.

581
00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:35.380
还不能及时找到他们
That's still not gonna find them in time.

582
00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:36.590
应该缩小寻找范围
You have to narrow your field.

583
00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.760
你能找到多少光谱仪
How many spectrometers do you have access to?

584
00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:40.590
- 你想要多少 - 给所有实验室打电话
- How many are there? - Call every lab you know.

585
00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.510
把光谱仪都架到屋顶上去
Tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof

586
00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:44.100
然后都校准到伽马射线上
and calibrate them for gamma rays.

587
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:47.520
我会设定一个追踪算法 然后对源头进行辨认
I'll rough out a tracking algorithm, basic cluster recognition.

588
00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:50.230
这样我们至少能滤掉一些目标
At least we could rule out a few places.

589
00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:52.270
给我找个干活的地方
Do you have somewhere for me to work?

590
00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:53.650
罗曼诺夫
Agent Romanoff,

591
00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:56.070
带班纳博士去他的实验室好吗
could you show Dr Banner to his laboratory, please?

592
00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:59.450
你会喜欢的 博士 那儿应有尽有
You're gonna love it, Doc. We got all the toys.

593
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:01.780
把它放那儿
Put it over there.

594
00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:05.910
你从哪儿找来这些人
Where did you find all these people?

595
00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:09.080
神盾局树敌不少啊 博士
S.H.I.E.L.D. has no shortage of enemies, Doctor.

596
00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:10.620
这是你要的东西
Is this the stuff you need?

597
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:11.790
没错 是铱
Yeah, iridium.

598
00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:12.790
铱元素

599
00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:12.790
海因里希·谢弗博士

600
00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:14.590
它随着陨石而来 可以形成反质子
It's found in meteorites. It forms anti-protons.

601
00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.420
这东西现在很抢手
It's very hard to get hold of.

602
00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:18.170
神盾局知道了就更抢手了
Especially if S.H.I.E.L.D. knows you need it.

603
00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:19.760
啊 我不知道
Well, I didn't know.

604
00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:21.180
嗨
Hey!

605
00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:23.680
宇宙魔方让我大开眼界
The Tesseract has shown me so much.

606
00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:26.060
这可不仅仅是知识 而是真理
It's more than knowledge. It's truth.

607
00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:27.180
我知道
I know.

608
00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:29.940
它让你看到了什么 巴顿
What did it show you, Agent Barton?

609
00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:32.310
我的下一个目标
My next target.

610
00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:33.480
告诉我你需要什么
Tell me what you need.

611
00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:38.820
我需要一个诱饵
I need a distraction.

612
00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:41.160
和眼线
And an eyeball.

613
00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:47.660
不符合

614
00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:50.460
我是说 如果不太麻烦
I mean, if it's not too much trouble.

615
00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:51.710
不不 没问题
No, no. It's fine.

616
00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:56.340
这是典藏版
It's a vintage set.

617
00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:58.840
我花了好几年才凑齐它们
It took me a couple of years to collect them all.

618
00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:02.470
很新的
Near mint.

619
00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:04.050
边角稍有些磨损 不过
Slight foxing around the edges, but...

620
00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:06.890
发现线索 吻合度67%
We got a hit. A 67% match.

621
00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:09.020
等等 79%
Wait. Cross match, 79%.

622
00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:11.020
什么地点
Location?

623
00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:14.230
德国的斯图加特 库宁大街28号
Stuttgart, Germany. 28, Canning Strasse.

624
00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:15.500
斯图加特 德国
库宁大街28号

625
00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:15.500
活跃地点           100%符合

626
00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:15.690
他没打算藏起来
He's not exactly hiding.

627
00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:17.020
队长
Captain,

628
00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:18.360
看你了
you're up.

629
00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:27.360
德国 斯图加特
Germany Stuttgart

630
00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:23.700
100%符合

631
00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:23.700
生物识别系统

632
00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:06.000
谢氏物理研究所

633
00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:10.500
视网膜扫瞄-身份识别系统

634
00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:10.500
通过认证

635
00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:10.500
海因里希·谢弗博士

636
00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:10.000
解锁

637
00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:55.020
都给我跪下
Kneel before me.

638
00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:00.770
我说了
I said

639
00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:05.030
跪下
kneel!

640
00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:17.700
这样不就简单了
Is not this simpler?

641
00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:22.460
你们不是天生就该如此吗
Is this not your natural state?

642
00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:27.970
这是人类没有道破的真理
It's the unspoken truth of humanity,

643
00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:30.550
自由的诱惑剥夺了你们
that you crave subjugation.

644
00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:34.890
生活中的快乐 你们渴望被奴役
The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life's joy

645
00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:37.680
你们疯狂地追求权势 追求地位
in a mad scramble for power, for identity.

646
00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:44.220
其实你们骨子里 充满了奴性
You were made to be ruled.

647
00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:50.700
早晚 会屈从于你们的统治者
In the end, you will always kneel.

648
00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:00.040
但不会是对你这种人
Not to men like you.

649
00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:03.000
我可是独一无二的
There are no men like me.

650
00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:06.750
你这样不要脸的人多了
There are always men like you.

651
00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:09.880
你们看看这个老家伙
Look to your elder, people.

652
00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:13.510
他就是你们的榜样
Let him be an example.

653
00:41:20.310 --> 00:41:22.900
记得上次 我来德国的时候
You know, the last time I was in Germany,

654
00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:26.270
也有一个人把自己凌驾于众人之上
and saw a man standing above everybody else,

655
00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:27.940
结果被干掉了
we ended up disagreeing.

656
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:30.110
是个大兵
The soldier.

657
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:33.410
一个过时的人
The man out of time.

658
00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:35.240
过时的人可不是我
I'm not the one who's out of time.

659
00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:41.290
洛基 放下武器 投降
Loki, drop the weapon and stand down.

660
00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:03.230
跪下
Kneel.

661
00:42:03.350 --> 00:42:04.770
你做梦
Not today!

662
00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:08.150
这家伙太狡猾了
The guy's all over the place.

663
00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:13.990
罗曼诺夫特工 想我了吗
Agent Romanoff. You miss me?

664
00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:15.490
系
统

665
00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:15.490
改
写

666
00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:32.800
再动一下 你这头驯鹿
Make your move, Reindeer Games.

667
00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:42.310
很好
Good move.

668
00:42:43.810 --> 00:42:45.100
史塔克先生
Mr Stark.

669
00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:46.940
队长
Captain.

670
00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:55.780
他说什么了吗
Is he saying anything?

671
00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:57.240
没有
Not a word.

672
00:42:57.530 --> 00:42:59.450
把他带过来 我们的时间很紧
Just get him here. We're low on time.

673
00:43:02.490 --> 00:43:03.500
有点不对劲
I don't like it.

674
00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:05.830
怎么 摇滚歌手投降得太容易了
What, Rock of Ages giving up so easily?

675
00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:07.710
我觉得没这么简单
I don't remember it being that easy.

676
00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:09.330
这家伙的实力很强
This guy packs a wallop.

677
00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:13.130
对你这么一个老年人来说 观察力还行
Still, you are pretty spry for an older fellow.

678
00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:15.760
你的秘诀是什么
What's your thing, Pilates?

679
00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:16.930
什么
What?

680
00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:18.090
你刚才的格斗
It's like calisthenics.

681
00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:20.260
有点像健美操 这么多年
You might have missed a couple of things

682
00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:22.100
真错过了不少发明
doing time as a Capsicle.

683
00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:25.600
弗瑞没说 他把你也叫来了
Fury didn't tell me he was calling you in.

684
00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:28.690
当然 弗瑞还有好多事没告诉你
Yeah, there's a lot of things Fury doesn't tell you.

685
00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:30.650
这闪电从哪儿来的
Where's this coming from?

686
00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:37.320
怎么了 难道你害怕闪电
What's the matter? Are you scared of a little lightning?

687
00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:40.030
我不喜欢一会儿打雷的那家伙
I'm not overly fond of what follows.

688
00:43:57.840 --> 00:43:59.010
你要干什么
What are you doing?

689
00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:13.400
这家伙说来就来了
And now there's that guy.

690
00:44:13.610 --> 00:44:15.360
又一个神域人吗
Another Asgardian?

691
00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:16.600
那家伙是自己人
That guy's a friendly?

692
00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:17.600
这不重要
Doesn't matter.

693
00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:20.200
不管他是放了洛基还是杀了他 宇宙魔方都没了
If he frees Loki or kills him, the Tesseract's lost.

694
00:44:20.410 --> 00:44:22.240
史塔克 得先制定作战计划
Stark, we need a plan of attack!

695
00:44:22.450 --> 00:44:24.740
计划就是 作战
I have a plan. Attack.

696
00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:32.540
我管不了他 队长
I'd sit this one out, Cap.

697
00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:33.750
我也不想管
I don't see how I can.

698
00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:36.590
这些都是传说中的人 他们基本上就是神
These guys come from legend. They're basically gods.

699
00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:38.340
世界上只有一个神
There's only one God, ma'am.

700
00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:40.840
但不会是那副打扮
And I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that.

701
00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:57.690
宇宙魔方在哪儿
Where is the Tesseract?

702
00:44:57.900 --> 00:44:59.190
好久不见 兄弟
I missed you, too.

703
00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:01.070
我像是来跟你叙旧的吗
Do I look to be in a gaming mood?

704
00:45:01.070 --> 00:45:06.070
无聊老生制作

705
00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:03.160
你应该感谢我
You should thank me.

706
00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:05.660
彩虹桥被摧毁后
With the Bifrost gone, how much dark energy

707
00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:08.620
你知道奥丁得调动多少暗能量
did the Allfather have to muster to conjure you here

708
00:45:08.830 --> 00:45:10.210
才能把你传送到你心爱的地球
to your precious Earth?

709
00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:15.630
我还以为你死了
I thought you dead.

710
00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:18.670
你哀悼我了
Did you mourn?

711
00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:20.920
我们都哀悼了 我们的父亲
We all did. Our father...

712
00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:24.180
是你的 父亲
Your father.

713
00:45:26.050 --> 00:45:28.930
他和你说了我的身世了对吗
He did tell you my true parentage, did he not?

714
00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:33.730
我们都是他养大的
We were raised together.

715
00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:36.570
我们一起玩耍 一起战斗
We played together, we fought together.

716
00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:36.940
一

717
00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:36.940
姓名：索尔/雷神（Quinjet）
必修：《雷神》
身份：奥丁之子，洛基之兄，来自神域的雷电之神
超能：自幼锻炼体能超强，借助雷神之锤可以
召唤闪电御风飞行，具有毁灭性的打击力

718
00:45:37.070 --> 00:45:38.280
难道你都忘了吗
Do you remember none of that?

719
00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:40.440
我心里只有阴影
I remember a shadow.

720
00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:44.990
我一直活在你的阴影里
Living in the shade of your greatness.

721
00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:48.330
我永远忘不了是你把我扔到深渊里
I remember you tossing me into an abyss.

722
00:45:48.450 --> 00:45:50.450
我是谁 我可是国王
I, who was, and should be, king!

723
00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:52.750
所以你想霸占这个世界
So you take the world I love as a recompense

724
00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:54.710
补偿你那莫名其妙的自卑感
for your imagined slights?

725
00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:58.000
不 我一定会保护我钟爱的地球
No. The Earth is under my protection, Loki.

726
00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:02.970
你保护得还真是很周到啊
And you're doing a marvellous job with that.

727
00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:05.390
人类在成群结队地彼此厮杀
The humans slaughter each other in droves

728
00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:07.300
你在一旁袖手旁观
while you idly fret.

729
00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:09.680
我要去统治他们 你觉得我不能
I mean to rule them, as why should I not?

730
00:46:09.890 --> 00:46:11.430
你觉得你比人类强大
You think yourself above them?

731
00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:13.520
当然了
Well, yes.

732
00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:16.190
你根本不懂什么叫统治 兄弟
Then you miss the truth of ruling, brother.

733
00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:18.400
王位让你如坐针毡
A throne would suit you ill.

734
00:46:23.610 --> 00:46:26.370
我见过你不知道的新世界
I've seen worlds you've never known about!

735
00:46:26.570 --> 00:46:30.740
我被流放的时候 苍天有眼 我因祸得福
I have grown, Odinson, in my exile.

736
00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:33.080
我见识了魔方的真正力量
I have seen the true power of the Tesseract,

737
00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:34.290
等我掌握它的时候
and when I wield it...

738
00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:36.250
是谁让你见识的
Who showed you this power?

739
00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:38.750
你的幕后黑手是谁
Who controls the would-be king?

740
00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:39.960
我就是国王
I am a king!

741
00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:40.960
别做梦了
Not here!

742
00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:42.260
交出宇宙魔方
You give up the Tesseract!

743
00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:44.930
放弃这些荒唐的梦想
You give up this poisonous dream!

744
00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:49.010
跟我回家吧
You come home.

745
00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:55.100
不在我这里
I don't have it.

746
00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:58.980
你需要魔方才能把我带回去
You need the Cube to bring me home.

747
00:46:59.110 --> 00:47:01.440
但它不见了 我也不知道它在哪儿
But I've sent it off, I know not where.

748
00:47:02.570 --> 00:47:04.400
你听好了 兄弟
You listen well, brother.

749
00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:07.570
我听着呢
I'm listening.

750
00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:18.380
你敢再碰我一下
Do not touch me again.

751
00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:20.170
那你别抢我东西
Then don't take my stuff.

752
00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:22.630
你知不知道 你在和谁说话
You have no idea what you're dealing with.

753
00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:25.510
你是话剧演员
Shakespeare in the Park?

754
00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:30.010
你妈妈知道你偷了她的披肩吗
Doth Mother know you wear-eth her drapes?

755
00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:33.020
管你该管的事情吧 铁皮人
This is beyond you, metal man.

756
00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:35.350
洛基一定会受到神域的审判
Loki will face Asgardian justice.

757
00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:38.940
只要他交出魔方 随便你 在这之前
He gives up the Cube, he's all yours. Until then,

758
00:47:39.310 --> 00:47:40.560
最好别碍事
stay out of the way.

759
00:47:42.110 --> 00:47:43.730
外乡人
Tourist.

760
00:47:49.110 --> 00:47:50.160
来吧
Okay.

761
00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:22.860
能量达到400%
Power at 400% capacity.

762
00:48:23.070 --> 00:48:24.610
怎么会这样
How about that?

763
00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:26.130
嗨
Hey!

764
00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:29.880
都给我住手
That's enough.

765
00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:35.470
你来这儿的目的是什么
Now, I don't know what you plan on doing here.

766
00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:37.970
我来这儿是为了阻止洛基的阴谋
I've come here to put an end to Loki's schemes.

767
00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:40.730
证明给我们看 把你的锤子放下
Then prove it. Put that hammer down.

768
00:49:40.850 --> 00:49:41.850
呃 不
Yeah... No.

769
00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:43.560
不是好主意 他超爱他的锤子
Bad call. He loves his hammer.

770
00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:47.400
你想让我放下我的锤子
You want me to put the hammer down?

771
00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:16.430
都闹够了吗
Are we done, here?

772
00:51:04.310 --> 00:51:07.270
说说你目前的处境
In case it's unclear,

773
00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:09.770
如果你想逃跑
if you try to escape,

774
00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:13.150
哪怕只是轻轻挠一下玻璃
if you so much as scratch that glass,

775
00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:26.710
你就会带着这个铁笼子 从30000米的高空自由落下去
it's 30,000 feet straight down in a steel trap.

776
00:51:27.250 --> 00:51:29.380
你都清楚了
You get how that works?

777
00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:34.050
蚂蚁 你的鞋
Ant, boot.

778
00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:39.140
这东西设计得不错
It's an impressive cage.

779
00:51:40.050 --> 00:51:42.680
应该不是给我用的 对吧
Not built, I think, for me.

780
00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:45.480
本来要关的东西比你凶得多
Built for something a lot stronger than you.

781
00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:47.560
我听说了
Oh, I've heard.

782
00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:49.730
是一个狂暴的野兽
A mindless beast.

783
00:51:50.730 --> 00:51:52.360
还假装自己是普通人
Makes play he's still a man.

784
00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:55.690
你得多绝望
How desperate are you,

785
00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:58.990
才需要找这种怪物来保护你
that you call on such lost creatures to defend you?

786
00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:01.530
我得多绝望
How desperate am I?

787
00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:03.540
你用战争威胁我们
You threaten my world with war.

788
00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:05.870
你偷走了根本控制不了的东西
You steal a force you can't hope to control.

789
00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:09.880
其实在你心里 杀戮 就是你最大的乐趣
You talk about peace, and you kill because it's fun.

790
00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:13.090
告诉你 你的确让我很绝望
You have made me very desperate.

791
00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:15.210
但是我会让你后悔的
You might not be glad that you did.

792
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:21.760
功亏一篑的感觉让你很懊恼吧
It burns you to have come so close.

793
00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:25.930
你差一点就获得了魔方的能量
To have the Tesseract, to have power,

794
00:52:26.730 --> 00:52:28.940
无止尽的能量
unlimited power.

795
00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:31.100
你的目的呢
And for what?

796
00:52:32.770 --> 00:52:36.570
让全人类分享温暖
A warm light for all mankind to share.

797
00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:40.070
现在你算是见识到它真正的力量了
And then to be reminded what real power is.

798
00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:48.460
你所谓的真正的力量 无非是想上杂志封面
Well, let me know if "real power" wants a magazine or something.

799
00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:55.800
监控画面

800
00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:58.260
这家伙可真够啰嗦的
He really grows on you, doesn't he?

801
00:52:58.470 --> 00:53:00.380
我看他是故意的
Loki's gonna drag this out.

802
00:53:00.590 --> 00:53:04.050
索尔 你说 他想干什么
So, Thor, what's his play?

803
00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:06.810
他手下有支军队叫齐塔瑞
He has an army called the Chitauri.

804
00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:09.940
他们不是神域人 不属于任何星球
They're not of Asgard, nor any world known.

805
00:53:10.350 --> 00:53:12.440
洛基打算带着他们进攻地球
He means to lead them against your people.

806
00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:14.230
他们一定会帮他的
They will win him the Earth,

807
00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:16.150
我想条件是那个宇宙魔方
in return, I suspect, for the Tesseract.

808
00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:18.110
一支军队
An army

809
00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:19.990
来自外星空间
from outer space.

810
00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:22.610
这么说他想打开传送门
So, he's building another portal.

811
00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:24.160
所以带走了席尔维格博士
That's what he needs Erik Selvig for.

812
00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:25.280
席尔维格
Selvig?

813
00:53:25.450 --> 00:53:26.490
他是个天文学家
He's an astrophysicist.

814
00:53:26.490 --> 00:53:27.490
他是我朋友
He's a friend.

815
00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:30.120
洛基用法术控制了他
Loki has him under some kind of spell,

816
00:53:30.290 --> 00:53:31.790
还有我们的一个同事
along with one of ours.

817
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.580
我不懂为什么洛基会投降
I want to know why Loki let us take him.

818
00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:35.000
他在这儿怎么指挥军队
He's not leading an army from here.

819
00:53:35.210 --> 00:53:36.920
我觉得不应该把注意力放在洛基身上
I don't think we should be focusing on Loki.

820
00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:38.920
这家伙的想法难以捉摸
That guy's brain is a bag full of cats.

821
00:53:39.050 --> 00:53:40.340
要我说他就是个疯子
You could smell crazy on him.

822
00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:42.300
你说话最好小心点
Have care how you speak.

823
00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:45.050
洛基的确蛮不讲理 但他是神域人
Loki is beyond reason, but he is of Asgard.

824
00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:46.560
而且我们是兄弟
And he is my brother.

825
00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:48.640
他在两天里杀了80个人
He killed 80 people in two days.

826
00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:50.520
我们是表亲
He's adopted.

827
00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:52.980
我觉得他的计划跟机械有关
I think it's about the mechanics.

828
00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:55.150
金属铱 他们要铱做什么
Iridium... What do they need the iridium for?

829
00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:56.360
可以用作稳定剂
It's a stabilising agent.

830
00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:57.820
我说 你挑个周末
I'm just saying, pick a weekend.

831
00:53:57.940 --> 00:53:59.490
我可以带你去波特兰
I'll fly you to Portland.

832
00:53:59.690 --> 00:54:01.240
感情要多沟通
Keep love alive.

833
00:54:01.450 --> 00:54:03.320
这样 新传送门
It means the portal won't collapse on itself

834
00:54:03.490 --> 00:54:05.320
就不会像神盾局的那样崩塌了
like it did at S.H.I.E.L.D.

835
00:54:05.530 --> 00:54:08.830
不打不相识 大明星 你的锤子很给力
No hard feelings, Point Break. You've got a mean swing.

836
00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:11.290
另外 根据洛基的需要
Also, it means the portal can open as wide

837
00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:13.920
那个传送门可以变得更大 持续时间更长
and stay open as long, as Loki wants.

838
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:16.840
呃 升起主帆 准备出发
Raise the mizzenmast. Jib the topsails.

839
00:54:18.550 --> 00:54:19.760
那个人在玩游戏
That man is playing Galaga.

840
00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:24.180
他以为没人注意 被我发现了
He thought we wouldn't notice, but we did.

841
00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:27.510
弗瑞怎么看这边
How does Fury even see these?

842
00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:28.680
转过身
He turns.

843
00:54:28.970 --> 00:54:30.600
不觉得累吗
Sounds exhausting.

844
00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:32.850
他们需要的其他资料
The rest of the raw materials,

845
00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:35.850
巴顿应该很容易就弄到手
Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily.

846
00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:37.440
目前他还需要一样
The only major component he still needs

847
00:54:37.650 --> 00:54:41.150
具有高密度能量的动力源
is a power source of high-energy density.

848
00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:44.610
是用来启动魔方的 应该  差不多了
Something to kick-start the Cube.

849
00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:47.780
你什么时候变成热核天体物理学家了
When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics?

850
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.990
昨天晚上
Last night.

851
00:54:49.490 --> 00:54:52.700
科尔森的报告 席尔维格的笔记 关于萃取理论的文章
The packet, Selvig's notes, the extraction theory papers.

852
00:54:52.910 --> 00:54:53.910
只有我一个人做功课吗
Am I the only one who did the reading?

853
00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:56.880
洛基是否需要某种特别的动力源
Does Loki need any particular kind of power source?

854
00:54:57.080 --> 00:54:59.800
他至少要把魔方加热到1亿度
He would have to heat the Cube to 120-million Kelvin

855
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.460
才能达到理论上的要求
just to break through the Coulomb barrier.

856
00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:03.880
除非席尔维格能找到某种方法
Unless Selvig has figured out how to stabilise

857
00:55:04.090 --> 00:55:05.220
来稳定量子隧道效应
the quantum tunnelling effect.

858
00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:06.430
如果他能做到的话
Well, if he could do that,

859
00:55:06.590 --> 00:55:09.050
他可以让地球上的任何一个反应堆 实现离子聚变
he could achieve heavy ion fusion at any reactor on the planet.

860
00:55:09.260 --> 00:55:11.680
看看 还是有懂行的
Finally, someone who speaks English.

861
00:55:11.890 --> 00:55:13.850
刚刚发生了什么
Is that what just happened?

862
00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:16.060
很高兴见到你 班纳博士
It's good to meet you, Dr Banner.

863
00:55:16.270 --> 00:55:19.310
你的正电子碰撞领域的成就 真的是无与伦比
Your work on antielectron collisions is unparalleled.

864
00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:21.320
我是你的超级粉丝 很欣赏你一发脾气
And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control

865
00:55:21.530 --> 00:55:23.570
就变成一个绿色大怪兽
and turn into an enormous green rage-monster.

866
00:55:25.110 --> 00:55:26.160
多谢
Thanks.

867
00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:28.870
班纳博士是来帮我们追踪魔方的
Dr Banner is only here to track the Cube.

868
00:55:29.070 --> 00:55:30.370
希望你能助他一臂之力
I was hoping you might join him.

869
00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:31.740
我会从洛基的权杖入手
I would start with that stick of his.

870
00:55:31.870 --> 00:55:32.910
那东西很像九头蛇的武器
It may be magical,

871
00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:34.330
可能真有魔力
but it works an awful lot like a HYDRA weapon.

872
00:55:34.450 --> 00:55:37.500
这我可说不准 但它通过魔方获得能量
I don't know about that, but it is powered by the Cube.

873
00:55:37.790 --> 00:55:39.540
我需要知道 洛基是怎么用它
And I would like to know how Loki used it

874
00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:41.340
把我认识的两个最靠谱的人
to turn two of the sharpest men I know

875
00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:43.260
变成供他指使的猴子
into his personal flying monkeys.

876
00:55:43.630 --> 00:55:45.170
变成猴子 什么意思
Monkeys? I do not understand.

877
00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:46.300
我知道
I do.

878
00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:51.180
这回我可听明白了
I understood that reference.

879
00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:53.430
我们开工 博士
Shall we play, Doctor?

880
00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:55.350
这边请 先生
This way, sir.

881
00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:10.910
伽马读数和席尔维格
The gamma readings are definitely consistent

882
00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:13.120
对魔方的报告是一致的
with Selvig's reports of the Tesseract.

883
00:56:13.490 --> 00:56:15.120
但处理起来需要花几周的时间
But it's going to take weeks to process.

884
00:56:15.330 --> 00:56:16.540
绕过神盾局的主系统
If we bypass their mainframe

885
00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:17.960
进入到分系统群
and direct route to the Homer cluster,

886
00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:21.250
就能把它加速到 每秒600万亿次浮点运算
we can clock this at around 600 teraflops.

887
00:56:22.420 --> 00:56:24.380
可惜我只带了一根牙刷
All I packed was a toothbrush.

888
00:56:25.460 --> 00:56:27.050
你有空到史塔克大厦来坐坐
You know, you should come by Stark Tower sometime.

889
00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:29.300
顶上十层 都是用来研发的
Top ten floors, all R&D.

890
00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:31.090
你会开心的
You'd love it. It's Candy Land.

891
00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:33.810
谢谢 但是我上次去纽约
Thanks, but the last time I was in New York,

892
00:56:34.010 --> 00:56:36.560
几乎把整个哈莱姆区  毁了
I kind of broke Harlem.

893
00:56:36.770 --> 00:56:38.600
我保证不会让你感受到什么压力
Well, I promise a stress-free environment.

894
00:56:38.810 --> 00:56:40.600
不会让你神经紧张 或者出什么意外
No tension, no surprises.

895
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:42.510
嗨
Hey!

896
00:56:42.510 --> 00:56:43.610
没反应
Nothing?

897
00:56:43.820 --> 00:56:44.820
你疯了
Are you nuts?

898
00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:45.940
目前没有
Jury's out.

899
00:56:46.070 --> 00:56:47.190
看来你的自控能力不错
You really have got a lid on it, haven't you?

900
00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:48.320
有什么秘诀
What's your secret?

901
00:56:48.450 --> 00:56:49.910
听音乐还是吃什么药
Mellowjazz, bongo drums, huge bag of weed?

902
00:56:50.070 --> 00:56:51.200
你总是这样没正行吗
Is everything a joke to you?

903
00:56:51.490 --> 00:56:52.490
那得分谁
Funny things are.

904
00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:55.740
你刚才的做法 可能会威胁到大家的安全
Threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isn't funny.

905
00:56:55.870 --> 00:56:56.870
对不起 博士
No offence, Doc.

906
00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.500
哦 没关系
It's all right, I wouldn't have come aboard

907
00:56:58.620 --> 00:57:01.460
如果我连这点刺激都接受不了 我就不会上船了
if I couldn't handle pointy things.

908
00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:04.170
你太谨慎了 大块头 得张扬一点
You're tip-toeing, big man. You need to strut.

909
00:57:04.290 --> 00:57:05.960
你该集中精力解决问题 史塔克先生
And you need to focus on the problem, Mr Stark.

910
00:57:06.090 --> 00:57:07.590
我没有吗
Do you think I'm not?

911
00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:10.510
弗瑞为什么招我们来 为什么现在 他有什么内幕
Why did Fury call us in? Why now? Why not before?

912
00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:12.390
一直瞒着我们
What isn't he telling us?

913
00:57:12.510 --> 00:57:14.260
不了解真相 就得不到正确的结论
I can't do the equation unless I have all the variables.

914
00:57:14.890 --> 00:57:16.140
你认为弗瑞有所隐瞒
You think Fury's hiding something?

915
00:57:16.270 --> 00:57:19.430
他是个特工 特工之王 队长
He's a spy. Captain, he's "the" spy.

916
00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:21.310
他背后有更多的秘密
His secrets have secrets.

917
00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:22.940
班纳也有同感 嗯
It's bugging him, too. Isn't it?

918
00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:27.320
我只是想完成我的工作 而且
I just want to finish my work here, and...

919
00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:28.440
博士
Doctor?

920
00:57:33.870 --> 00:57:36.240
让全人类分享温暖
"A warm light for all mankind."

921
00:57:36.370 --> 00:57:38.450
这是刚才洛基对弗瑞说的话
Loki's jab at Fury about the Cube.

922
00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:40.040
我听到了
I heard it.

923
00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:42.460
我觉得他是说给你听的
I think that was meant for you.

924
00:57:43.170 --> 00:57:46.130
即使巴顿没跟洛基说起过史塔克大厦
Even if Barton didn't tell Loki about the tower,

925
00:57:46.250 --> 00:57:47.340
新闻上也都说了
it was still all over the news.

926
00:57:47.460 --> 00:57:49.550
史塔克大厦 那个又大又丑的
The Stark Tower? That big, ugly

927
00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:52.130
在纽约的那栋
building in New York?

928
00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:55.970
由方舟反应炉供能 能源可自我再生
It's powered by an arc reactor, a self-sustaining energy source.

929
00:57:56.100 --> 00:57:58.520
那大厦能自给自足一年吗
That building will run itself for, what, a year?

930
00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:00.480
只是个原型机
It's just the prototype.

931
00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:02.560
目前我可是清洁能源领域的第一人
I'm kind of the only name in clean energy right now.

932
00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:04.400
他们也要这个
That's what he's getting at.

933
00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:07.110
那么 为什么神盾局 不招你加入魔方工程呢
So, why didn't S.H.I.E.L.D. bring him in on the Tesseract project?

934
00:58:07.230 --> 00:58:10.440
我是说他们涉足能源产业 又是为了什么呢
What are they doing in the energy business in the first place?

935
00:58:10.570 --> 00:58:13.530
我确实应该调查一下
I should probably look into that once my decryption programme

936
00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:15.820
一旦我的破解程序 侵入神盾局的机密档案
finishes breaking into all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s secure files.

937
00:58:15.950 --> 00:58:16.950
等等 你是想
I'm sorry. Did you say...

938
00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:19.080
我上船后 贾维斯一直在破解程序
Jarvis has been running it since I hit the bridge.

939
00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:22.080
几小时后我就会知道神盾局所有不可告人的秘密了
In a few hours, I'll know every dirty secret S.H.I.E.L.D. has ever tried to hide.

940
00:58:22.210 --> 00:58:23.210
吃吗
Blueberry?

941
00:58:23.330 --> 00:58:25.210
不招你加入魔方工程 你想不通是吧
Yet you're confused about why they didn't want you around.

942
00:58:25.330 --> 00:58:28.170
情报机构居然会怕聪明人
An intelligence organisation that fears intelligence?

943
00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:29.880
这未免太丢人了 不可能
Historically, not awesome.

944
00:58:30.010 --> 00:58:32.300
洛基就是想让我们相互质疑
I think Loki's trying to wind us up.

945
00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:34.010
他图谋发动战争
This is a man who means to start a war

946
00:58:34.130 --> 00:58:35.680
如果我们不能专心致志 他就会得手
and if we don't stay focused, he'll succeed.

947
00:58:36.970 --> 00:58:39.430
我们都有命令在身 应该服从命令
We have orders. We should follow them.

948
00:58:39.930 --> 00:58:41.930
服从命令可不是我的作风
Following's not really my style.

949
00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:45.520
你只想自己出风头 是吗
And you're all about style, aren't you?

950
00:58:45.650 --> 00:58:46.690
这屋里的人当中
Of the people in this room,

951
00:58:46.810 --> 00:58:48.400
是谁穿着华丽的戏服走来走去
which one is, A, wearing a spangly outfit,

952
00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:49.860
而且 又很没用
and, B, not of use?

953
00:58:49.980 --> 00:58:54.320
说的是啊 你真没觉得你的穿戴有些不自在吗
Steve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you.

954
00:58:57.030 --> 00:58:58.080
尽快找到魔方
Just find the Cube.

955
00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:12.920
这就是我老爸推崇备至的家伙
That's the guy my dad never shut up about?

956
00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:16.180
我觉得应该考虑再把他冷冻回去
I'm wondering if they shouldn't have kept him on ice.

957
00:59:17.010 --> 00:59:18.720
他对洛基的判断是对的
The guy's not wrong about Loki.

958
00:59:18.850 --> 00:59:20.600
比我们的思维更慎密
He does have the jump on us.

959
00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:23.430
简直就像 马戏团的小丑
What he's got is an Acme dynamite kit.

960
00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:25.390
早晚有演砸的时候
It's going to blow up in his face.

961
00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:27.810
我就等着看好戏吧
And I'm going to be there when it does.

962
00:59:28.110 --> 00:59:30.270
那我看看报纸吧
Yeah. I'll read all about it.

963
00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:33.690
要不你也和我们一起变装上阵
Or you'll be suiting up with the rest of us.

964
00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:38.870
算了吧 我可没有你的护甲
You see, I don't get a suit of armour.

965
00:59:38.990 --> 00:59:42.330
凭我这肉身 就去玩命
I'm exposed. Like a nerve.

966
00:59:42.450 --> 00:59:44.200
别开玩笑了
It's a nightmare.

967
00:59:44.330 --> 00:59:47.120
你知道 每分每秒都有 一堆细小的弹片
I've got a cluster of shrapnel trying every second

968
00:59:47.250 --> 00:59:49.250
试图钻入我的心脏
to crawl its way into my heart.

969
00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:51.420
是这个 保护了我
This stops it.

970
00:59:51.550 --> 00:59:53.880
这个小光环已经是我的一部分了
This little circle of light, it's part of me now,

971
00:59:55.090 --> 00:59:56.760
它不仅是护甲
not just armour.

972
00:59:57.430 --> 00:59:59.890
是一种可怕的恩赐
It's a terrible privilege.

973
01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:01.300
但你完全可以控制它
But you can control it.

974
01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:02.300
无聊老生制作

975
01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:02.700
因为我学会了方法
Because I learned how.

976
01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:03.720
我不一样
It's different.

977
01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:07.390
嗨 我对你的遭遇一清二楚
Hey, I read all about your accident.

978
01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:10.860
那么强的伽马射线 足以杀死你
That much gamma exposure should have killed you.

979
01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:13.440
你的意思是说另一个我
So you're saying that the Hulk...

980
01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:17.280
也就是浩克 救了我的命
The other guy saved my life?

981
01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:18.910
这想法不错
That's nice.

982
01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:23.580
可他为什么救我 他的目的是 什么
It's a nice sentiment. Saved it for what?

983
01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:26.790
我们会知道的
I guess we'll find out.

984
01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:30.170
那时候你就乐不起来了
You may not enjoy that.

985
01:00:30.290 --> 01:00:32.250
你可能会
And you just might.

986
01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:37.300
机密仓库

987
01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:32.860
洛基掳走博士之后
As soon as Loki took the doctor,

988
01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:35.500
一

989
01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:35.500
姓名：简·福斯特（Jane Foster）
必修：《雷神》
身份：席尔维格博士的学生，索尔的地球女友。
超能：无

990
01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:36.600
简·福斯特

991
01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:34.230
我们转移了简·福斯特
we moved Jane Foster.

992
01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:37.230
在挪威有个非常好的天文台
They've got an excellent observatory in Troms.

993
01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:40.900
昨天已经有人把她请过去当顾问了
She was asked to consult there very suddenly yesterday.

994
01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:44.830
报酬很好 私人飞机 还很偏僻
Handsome fee, private plane, very remote.

995
01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:46.740
她会非常安全
She'll be safe.

996
01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:48.250
谢谢
Thank you.

997
01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:52.080
洛基带走席尔维格 绝对不是巧合
It's no accident, Loki taking Erik Selvig.

998
01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:55.670
我担心洛基完事后 对他下毒手
I dread what he plans for him once he's done.

999
01:01:55.790 --> 01:01:56.920
席尔维格是个好人
Erik is a good man.

1000
01:01:57.050 --> 01:01:58.050
他常常提起你
He talks about you a lot.

1001
01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:01.930
你改变了他的人生
You changed his life.

1002
01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:05.510
你也改变了这里的一切
You changed everything around here.

1003
01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:07.760
还是我来之前好
They were better as they were.

1004
01:02:08.350 --> 01:02:10.430
在神域 我们假装自己发达
We pretend on Asgard that we're more advanced

1005
01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:14.270
到这儿后 我们就像巨型锥鸟一样打仗
but we come here, battling like bilge snipe.

1006
01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:16.230
- 像什么 - 巨型锥鸟
- Like what? - Bilge snipe.

1007
01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:19.400
超大 有鳞和一对大角
You know, huge, scaly, big antlers.

1008
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:21.990
- 这儿没有吗 - 应该没有
- You don't have those? - I don't think so.

1009
01:02:22.110 --> 01:02:23.990
这东西很讨厌
Well, they are repulsive.

1010
01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:27.580
它们不管到哪儿都一路破坏
And they trample everything in their path.

1011
01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:38.590
我第一次来地球的时候 洛基对我的仇恨也跟了过来
When I first came to Earth, Loki's rage followed me here,

1012
01:02:38.710 --> 01:02:41.050
你们的人也付出了代价
and your people paid the price.

1013
01:02:41.170 --> 01:02:42.970
现在又是这样
And now, again.

1014
01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:47.970
年轻的时候 我曾渴望战争
In my youth, I courted war.

1015
01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:51.730
战争还没开始呢
War hasn't started yet.

1016
01:02:52.850 --> 01:02:54.650
你觉得你能让洛基告诉我们
You think you could make Loki tell us

1017
01:02:54.770 --> 01:02:56.060
魔方在哪儿吗
where the Tesseract is?

1018
01:02:56.190 --> 01:02:59.440
我不知道 没人能摸透洛基的想法
I do not know. Loki's mind is far afield.

1019
01:02:59.570 --> 01:03:04.280
他要的不仅是权势 还有对我的 报复
It's not just power he craves, it's vengeance, upon me.

1020
01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:06.530
为达目的 他能忍受任何痛苦
There's no pain would prise his need from him.

1021
01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:09.830
有句老话说的好
A lot of guys think that

1022
01:03:09.950 --> 01:03:11.450
不见棺材不落泪
until the pain starts.

1023
01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:15.250
你想让我做什么
What are you asking me to do?

1024
01:03:15.370 --> 01:03:18.960
应该说 是你自己打算怎么去做
I'm asking, what are you prepared to do?

1025
01:03:19.090 --> 01:03:20.130
洛基是个囚犯
Loki is a prisoner.

1026
01:03:20.250 --> 01:03:22.590
我怎么觉得他是唯一一个
Then why do I feel like he's the only person on this boat

1027
01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:24.300
想留在这艘船上的人
that wants to be here?

1028
01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:39.980
能偷偷摸摸接近我的人可不多
There's not many people who can sneak up on me.

1029
01:03:40.110 --> 01:03:41.780
你猜到我该来了
But you figured I'd come.

1030
01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:44.030
还用说吗
After.

1031
01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:48.320
无论弗瑞那家伙用什么酷刑折磨我
After whatever tortures Fury can concoct,

1032
01:03:48.450 --> 01:03:52.120
你总会像老朋友一样 准时出现
you would appear as a friend, as a balm.

1033
01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:54.750
我真是太感动了
And I would cooperate.

1034
01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:56.870
我想知道你对巴顿做了什么
I want to know what you've done to Agent Barton.

1035
01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
我只是开阔了他的思维
I would say I've expanded his mind.

1036
01:04:01.590 --> 01:04:03.510
那等你赢了之后
And once you've won,

1037
01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:05.670
等你如愿以偿之后
once you're king of the mountain,

1038
01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:10.300
巴顿的思维会变成什么样
what happens to his mind?

1039
01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:13.350
你爱他 罗曼诺夫特工
Is this love, Agent Romanoff?

1040
01:04:13.470 --> 01:04:16.310
爱是小孩的事 我欠他个人情
Love is for children. I owe him a debt.

1041
01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:22.070
跟我说说
Tell me.

1042
01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:29.660
在加入神盾局之前
Before I worked for S.H.I.E.L.D... I...

1043
01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:36.000
我是名声在外
Well, I made a name for myself.

1044
01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:39.120
我有 我有一些很独特的技能
I have a very specific skill set.

1045
01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:42.920
其实我不在乎是为谁卖命 或者是去要谁的命
I didn't care who I used it for, or on.

1046
01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:47.420
所以 我上了神盾局的黑名单
I got on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s radar in a bad way.

1047
01:04:48.590 --> 01:04:51.510
巴顿特工被派来杀我
Agent Barton was sent to kill me.

1048
01:04:52.550 --> 01:04:54.100
但他没那么做
He made a different call.

1049
01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:59.100
如果我答应放过他 你能为我做什么
And what will you do if I vow to spare him?

1050
01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:00.810
我不会放你的
Not let you out.

1051
01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:02.820
有意思 跟我讨价还价
No, but I like this.

1052
01:05:03.730 --> 01:05:07.150
你自己都泥菩萨过河 还想着惦记别人
Your world in the balance, and you bargain for one man.

1053
01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:09.360
政治跟我没关系
Regimes fall every day.

1054
01:05:09.490 --> 01:05:12.030
我从来就不关心这个 我是
I tend not to weep over that. I'm Russian.

1055
01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:13.160
曾经是俄国人
Or I was.

1056
01:05:14.450 --> 01:05:16.120
你现在是什么
And what are you now?

1057
01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:19.540
事情没你想得那么复杂
It's really not that complicated.

1058
01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:23.750
我只是有一笔债 非还不可的债
I got red in my ledger, I'd like to wipe it out.

1059
01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:26.300
是吗
Can you?

1060
01:05:27.630 --> 01:05:31.430
你能还清你欠下的所有血债吗
Can you wipe out that much red?

1061
01:05:32.590 --> 01:05:34.390
德雷科夫的女儿
Dreykov's daughter,

1062
01:05:35.810 --> 01:05:37.640
圣保罗
StoPaulo,

1063
01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:41.190
那场医院的大火
the hospital fire?

1064
01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:44.400
巴顿什么都和我说了
Barton told me everything.

1065
01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:47.610
你的账单在滴血 你的血债太多了
Your ledger is dripping. It's gushing red

1066
01:05:47.730 --> 01:05:50.240
你觉得救一个比你高尚不到哪儿去的人
and you think saving a man no more virtuous than yourself

1067
01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:51.740
能改变什么吗
will change anything?

1068
01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:54.530
这是最低级的恻隐之心
This is the basest sentimentality.

1069
01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:56.910
简直太幼稚 可笑
This is a child at prayer.

1070
01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:58.330
太可悲了
Pathetic!

1071
01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:01.710
你满口谎言 手上沾满鲜血
You lie and kill

1072
01:06:01.830 --> 01:06:04.710
为骗子和杀手卖命
in the service of liars and killers.

病毒检测
未经授权访问

1077
01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:11.130
你自命清高 以为有自己的准则
You pretend to be separate, to have your own code,

1078
01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:13.970
以为这样就能抵销自己的罪孽
something that makes up for the horrors.

1079
01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:17.560
但那是你的本性
But they are part of you.

1080
01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:21.480
永远永远都不会 消失
And they will never go away.

1081
01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:25.560
我不会伤害巴顿 至少让他干掉你之前
I won't touch Barton, not until I make him kill you.

1082
01:06:25.690 --> 01:06:27.940
慢慢地 温柔地
Slowly, intimately,

1083
01:06:28.070 --> 01:06:30.440
他对你的恐惧无所不知
in every way he knows you fear.

1084
01:06:30.570 --> 01:06:33.660
我会给他足够长的时间 让他意识到自己干了什么
And then he'll wake just long enough to see his good work

1085
01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:37.240
等他仰天长啸 我再敲碎他的脑袋
and when he screams, I'll split his skull.

1086
01:06:37.370 --> 01:06:40.500
这就是我给你的价码 你这个小贱货
This is my bargain, you mewling quim.

1087
01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:43.670
你这个疯子
You're a monster.

1088
01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:47.380
哦 不
Oh, no.

1089
01:06:48.250 --> 01:06:49.840
疯子还没出来呢
You brought the monster.

1090
01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:54.430
原来 班纳
So, Banner.

1091
01:06:55.470 --> 01:06:56.640
是你的目的
That's your play.

1092
01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:57.810
什么
What?

1093
01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:00.430
洛基打算利用班纳
Loki means to unleash the Hulk.

1094
01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:02.020
如果他在实验室 不要让他离开
Keep Banner in the lab. I'm on my way.

1095
01:07:02.140 --> 01:07:03.230
让索尔马上过去
Send Thor as well.

1096
01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:06.230
谢谢
Thank you

1097
01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:08.520
多谢你的配合
for your cooperation.

1098
01:07:16.030 --> 01:07:17.490
你在干什么 史塔克先生
What are you doing, Mr Stark?

1099
01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:20.120
呃 我也正想问你这个问题
Kind of been wondering the same thing about you.

1100
01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:22.120
你应该去想办法找出魔方的位置
You're supposed to be locating the Tesseract.

1101
01:07:22.250 --> 01:07:23.830
想着呢 信号已经锁定
We are. The model's locked

1102
01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:25.250
正在搜索伽马射线的标记
and we're sweeping for the signature now.

1103
01:07:25.370 --> 01:07:26.380
找到后
When we get a hit,

1104
01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:28.460
会把目标锁定在半英里内
we'll have the location within half a mile.

1105
01:07:28.590 --> 01:07:31.240
伽马射线定位

1106
01:07:28.590 --> 01:07:31.240
搜索...

1107
01:07:31.590 --> 01:07:32.240
授予访问权限

1108
01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:33.940
第2阶段

1109
01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:32.640
绝密

1110
01:07:28.590 --> 01:07:32.840
之后就能拿回你的魔方了 别着急
Yeah, then you get your Cube back. No muss, no fuss.

1111
01:07:32.970 --> 01:07:34.090
什么是第2阶段
What is "Phase 2"?

1112
01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:39.140
第2阶段 就是神盾局用魔方来制造武器
Phase 2 is S.H.I.E.L.D. uses the Cube to make weapons.

1113
01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:41.010
抱歉 电脑的速度对我来说太慢了
Sorry, computer was moving a little slow for me.

1114
01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:43.850
先生们 我们搜集一切和魔方有关的东西
Rogers, we gathered everything related to the Tesseract.

1115
01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:45.440
但这并不代表我们在制造
This does not mean that we're making...

1116
01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:46.560
得了吧 尼克
I'm sorry, Nick.

1117
01:07:46.690 --> 01:07:48.980
你别狡辩了
What were you lying?

1118
01:07:49.110 --> 01:07:50.360
我错了 指挥官
I was wrong, Director.

1119
01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:51.530
这个世界一点都没变
The world hasn't changed a bit.

1120
01:07:51.650 --> 01:07:52.690
你知道这情况吗
Did you know about this?

1121
01:07:52.820 --> 01:07:55.610
你难道不想离开这个地方吗 博士
You want to think about removing yourself from this environment, Doctor?

1122
01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:57.910
我当时可在加尔各答啊 跟我没什么关系
I was in Calcutta. I was pretty well removed.

1123
01:07:58.030 --> 01:07:59.200
洛基在利用你
Loki is manipulating you.

1124
01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:00.910
那你的目的又是什么呢
And you've been doing what, exactly?

1125
01:08:01.030 --> 01:08:02.700
你到这儿来 不是因为我冲你抛媚眼
You didn't come here because I bat my eyelashes at you.

1126
01:08:02.830 --> 01:08:03.950
那我走
Yes, and I'm not leaving

1127
01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:05.370
也不是因为你神经兮兮的
because suddenly you get a little twitchy.

1128
01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:07.120
我需要知道的是 为什么神盾局
I'd like to know why S.H.I.E.L.D.

1129
01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:10.960
在利用魔方 制造大规模杀伤性武器
is using the Tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction.

1130
01:08:11.590 --> 01:08:12.710
就因为他
Because of him.

1131
01:08:14.010 --> 01:08:15.010
我
Me?

1132
01:08:15.970 --> 01:08:18.340
去年地球迎来了一个从外星来的访客
Last year, Earth had a visitor from another planet

1133
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:21.640
他的一些个人恩怨 导致一座小镇被夷为平地
who had a grudge match that levelled a small town.

1134
01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:23.970
我们得知了宇宙中不但有别的生命
We learned that not only are we not alone

1135
01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:27.690
还比我们强大得多 先进得多 发达得多
but we are hopelessly, hilariously, outgunned.

1136
01:08:27.810 --> 01:08:30.060
我们的人对你们的星球没有任何恶意
My people want nothing but peace with your planet.

1137
01:08:30.190 --> 01:08:32.150
但宇宙中并非只有你们
But you're not the only people out there, are you?

1138
01:08:32.270 --> 01:08:34.230
你也不是唯一的威胁
And you're not the only threat.

1139
01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:37.530
这个世界上有很多找不到对手的人
The world's filling up with people who can't be matched,

1140
01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:39.410
他们也不会被人控制
that can't be controlled.

1141
01:08:39.530 --> 01:08:40.660
就像你控制魔方那样
Like you controlled the Cube?

1142
01:08:40.780 --> 01:08:42.030
正是你对魔方的开发
Your work with the Tesseract

1143
01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:44.750
才引来了洛基和他的盟友
is what drew Loki to it, and his allies.

1144
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:46.250
对别的星球来说
It is a signal to all the realms

1145
01:08:46.370 --> 01:08:49.040
这是你们地球人做好高级战争准备的一个信号
that the Earth is ready for a higher form of war.

1146
01:08:49.170 --> 01:08:50.250
高级战争
A higher form?

1147
01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:51.380
你们逼我们出手
You forced our hand.

1148
01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:52.500
我们得有应急
We had to come up with something.

1149
01:08:52.630 --> 01:08:53.630
比如核威慑
A nuclear deterrent.

1150
01:08:53.750 --> 01:08:55.760
这招能让所有事都冷静下来
Because that always calms everything right down.

1151
01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:58.260
你倒是说说你是怎么发家致富的 史塔克
Remind me again how you made your fortune, Stark.

1152
01:08:58.380 --> 01:09:00.760
如果他还在制造武器 他肯定已经被埋在
I'm sure if he still made weapons, Stark would be neck-deep...

1153
01:09:00.890 --> 01:09:02.510
等等 怎么矛头又对准我了
Hold on. How is this now about me?

1154
01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:03.760
难道不是一直对你吗
I'm sorry, isn't everything?

1155
01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:05.770
我还以为地球人能更开化一点呢
I thought humans were more evolved than this.

1156
01:09:05.890 --> 01:09:08.770
我们可没到你的星球上去胡作非为
Excuse me, did we come to your planet and blow stuff up?

1157
01:09:08.890 --> 01:09:10.770
你们对自己的队友这么没有信心
You treat your champions with such mistrust.

1158
01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:12.360
你们这些人这么幼稚
Are you boys really that naive?

1159
01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:14.360
神盾局只是在监视潜在威胁
S.H.I.E.L.D. monitors potential threats.

1160
01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:15.780
原来美国队长也是潜在威胁
Captain America's on threat watch?

1161
01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:17.070
我们都是
We all are.

1162
01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:18.520
等等 你在也名单上
Wait, you're on that list?

1163
01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:20.110
你排在愤怒的蜜蜂之前还是之后
Are you above or below angry bees?

1164
01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:22.370
史塔克 听着 如果你的嘴再犯贱
Stark, so help me God, if you make one more wisecrack...

1165
01:09:22.490 --> 01:09:23.740
恐吓 赤裸裸的恐吓 我受到了威胁
Threat! Verbal threat. I feel threatened.

1166
01:09:23.870 --> 01:09:26.370
- 请你放尊重些  - 尊重什么
- Show some respect. - Respect what?

1167
01:09:33.710 --> 01:09:36.630
66B号运输船 电脑上有你的资料
Transport Six-Six-Bravo, please relay confirm codes.

1168
01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:38.920
但没有你的航行记录
I've got you on the computer, but not on the day log.

1169
01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:41.140
你运的是什么货物 完毕
What is your haul? Over.

1170
01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:43.890
武器和弹药 完毕
Arms and ammunition. Over.

1171
01:09:52.230 --> 01:09:54.440
你说要秩序 现在还不是一团糟
You speak of control, yet you court chaos.

1172
01:09:54.570 --> 01:09:56.280
这是他的管理方法
That's his M.O., isn't it?

1173
01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:57.650
我们算什么 一个团队
I mean, what are we, a team?

1174
01:09:57.780 --> 01:10:00.740
不 不 我们混在一起 只会制造混乱
No, we're a chemical mixture that makes chaos.

1175
01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:02.820
就像 定时炸弹一样
We're a time bomb.

1176
01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:04.780
你 应该冷静一下
You need to step away.

1177
01:10:04.910 --> 01:10:06.740
男人为什么不能适当发泄一下
Why shouldn't the guy let off a little steam?

1178
01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:09.000
你唯恐天下不乱吗  走开
You know damn well why. Back off!

1179
01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:11.330
我看你怎么让我走开
I'm starting to want you to make me.

1180
01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:15.090
是啊 躲在护甲里逞英雄
Yeah. Big man in a suit of armour.

1181
01:10:15.210 --> 01:10:16.670
没有护甲 你算什么
Take that off, what are you?

1182
01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:19.130
算天才 百万富翁 花花公子 慈善家
Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.

1183
01:10:20.010 --> 01:10:23.180
很多什么都不是的人 比你强十倍
I know guys with none of that worth ten of you.

1184
01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:24.300
我见得多了
I've seen the footage.

1185
01:10:24.430 --> 01:10:26.680
你只会为自己拚命
The only thing you really fight for is yourself.

1186
01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:30.060
你绝对不是那种能自我牺牲的人
You're not the guy to make the sacrifice play,

1187
01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:32.690
趴在铁丝网上 让战友们从身上过去
to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you.

1188
01:10:32.810 --> 01:10:34.940
我认为应该剪断铁丝网
I think I would just cut the wire.

1189
01:10:37.570 --> 01:10:39.780
你总有歪点子
Always a way out.

1190
01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:41.150
也许你还算不上威胁
You may not be a threat

1191
01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:43.200
但你最好不要把自己当成个英雄
but you better stop pretending to be a hero.

1192
01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:45.780
英雄 像你一样
A hero? Like you?

1193
01:10:45.910 --> 01:10:47.950
你不过是个实验品 罗杰斯
You're a laboratory experiment, Rogers.

1194
01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:51.710
你所有的能力 都来自一个小瓶子
Everything special about you came out of a bottle.

1195
01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:19.820
穿上你的护甲 我们单挑
Put on the suit. Let's go a few rounds.

1196
01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:24.280
你们这些人可真小气 太小气
You people are so petty and tiny.

1197
01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:25.410
对 这就是团队
Yeah, this is a team.

1198
01:11:25.530 --> 01:11:28.030
罗曼诺夫特工 请你带班纳博士去他的
Agent Romanoff, would you escort Dr Banner back to his...

1199
01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:29.830
我的房间  你不是借给洛基了吗
Where? You rented my room.

1200
01:11:29.950 --> 01:11:31.410
那是为了以防万一
The cell was just in case...

1201
01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:33.080
是万一你需要干掉我吧
In case you needed to kill me.

1202
01:11:33.210 --> 01:11:36.120
那不可能 我知道 我试过
But you can't. I know, I tried.

1203
01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:41.760
我失望过  因为我看不到未来
I got low. I didn't see an end.

1204
01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:46.340
所以我对着自己开了一枪 但另一个我把子弹吐了出来
So, I put a bullet in my mouth, and the other guy spit it out.

1205
01:11:46.930 --> 01:11:48.140
凑合着活
So I moved on.

1206
01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:51.100
我尝试着去帮助别人 我做得不错
I focused on helping other people. I was good.

1207
01:11:51.220 --> 01:11:53.430
直到你把我拉进这个怪胎秀
Until you dragged me back into this freak show

1208
01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:54.940
让所有人都身处险境
and put everyone here at risk.

1209
01:11:55.060 --> 01:11:57.150
你想知道我的秘密吗
You want to know my secret, Agent Romanoff?

1210
01:11:57.270 --> 01:11:59.110
你想知道我是如何保持平静的吗
You want to know how I stay calm?

1211
01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:04.070
班纳博士
Dr Banner,

1212
01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:06.200
把那东西放下
put down the sceptre.

1213
01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:12.200
伽马射线定位

1214
01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:11.700
搜索...

1215
01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:12.200
伽马射线符合度

1216
01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:16.120
找到了
Got it.

1217
01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:17.960
抱歉 伙计们
Sorry, kids,

1218
01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:19.840
我的拿手好戏派不上用场
you don't get to see my party trick after all.

1219
01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:20.960
你定位到魔方了
You located the Tesseract?

1220
01:12:21.090 --> 01:12:22.090
我可以先过去
I could get there fastest.

1221
01:12:22.210 --> 01:12:24.340
宇宙魔方属于神域 人类无法控制它
The Tesseract belongs on Asgard. No human is a match for it.

1222
01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:25.800
- 你不能一个人去 - 你想阻止我
- You're not going alone. - You're gonna stop me?

1223
01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:26.930
穿上护甲 小心点
Put on the suit, let's find out.

1224
01:12:27.050 --> 01:12:28.340
再不济也比老家伙强
I'm not afraid to hit an old man.

1225
01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:29.470
想试试吗
Put on the suit.

1226
01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:32.200
伽马射线定位

1227
01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:32.200
伽马射线符合度

1228
01:12:32.350 --> 01:12:33.970
哦 天呐
Oh, my God.

1229
01:12:49.490 --> 01:12:50.490
快穿上护甲
Put on the suit.

1230
01:12:50.620 --> 01:12:51.910
好的
Yeah.

1231
01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:56.410
赶快拿武器
All hands to stations.

1232
01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:02.340
- 希尔 - 外部发生爆炸
- Hill! - External detonation.

1233
01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:03.710
三号引擎停止运行了
Number three engine is down.

1234
01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:04.840
我们被击中了
We've been hit.

1235
01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:06.130
- 引擎能修复吗  - 三号引擎起火
- Can they get it running? - Fire in engine three!

1236
01:13:06.260 --> 01:13:07.260
回答我
Talk to me.

1237
01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:09.010
涡轮基本上没事
Turbine looks mostly intact

1238
01:13:09.130 --> 01:13:11.010
但只要我们还在飞行
but it's impossible to get out there to make repairs

1239
01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:12.550
就不可能派人出去进行修补
while we're in the air.

1240
01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:15.220
再失去一个引擎就完蛋了
If we lose one more engine, we won't be.

1241
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:17.310
必须得有人出去修理引擎
Somebody's got to get outside and patch that engine.

1242
01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:18.310
史塔克 听到了吗
Stark, you copy that?

1243
01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:19.310
我去修
I'm on it.

1244
01:13:19.310 --> 01:13:22.610
科尔森 打开封闭区的防御封锁
Coulson, initiate defensive lockdown in the detention section

1245
01:13:22.730 --> 01:13:23.730
然后去军械库
then get to the armoury.

1246
01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:24.980
罗曼诺夫
Romanoff?

1247
01:13:28.610 --> 01:13:30.070
我没事
We're okay.

1248
01:13:32.660 --> 01:13:33.910
大家都没事吧
We're okay, right?

1249
01:13:46.510 --> 01:13:47.710
- 不能让他们修复引擎   - 是 长官
- Keep that engine down!  - Yes, sir.

1250
01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:49.550
去封闭区等摄像头关闭
Detention, wait for cameras to go dark.

1251
01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:50.800
- 是  - 跟着我
- Got it. - Stay close.

1252
01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:54.720
我们走 去第4层
Let's go, Level 4.

1253
01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:58.480
三号引擎 在那儿碰头
Engine three. I'll meet you there.

1254
01:14:06.650 --> 01:14:07.820
博士
Doctor?

1255
01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:11.200
班纳
Bruce?

1256
01:14:11.490 --> 01:14:15.160
你要坚持 不然正中洛基下怀
You got to fight it. This is just what Loki wants.

1257
01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:17.580
我们会没事的
We're going to be okay. Listen to me.

1258
01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:18.700
你受伤了吗
Are you hurt?

1259
01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.210
我们会没事的
We're going to be okay. All right?

1260
01:14:24.330 --> 01:14:27.090
听着 我用我的生命担保 一定会把你带出去
I swear on my life, I will get you out of this.

1261
01:14:27.210 --> 01:14:28.590
你可以躲得远远的
You will walk away and never ever...

1262
01:14:28.710 --> 01:14:30.800
你的生命
Your life?

1263
01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:48.320
班纳
Bruce.

1264
01:15:25.190 --> 01:15:28.360
把航母飞回到座标180 向南前进
Bring the carrier about to a 1-8-0, heading south!

1265
01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:29.480
回到水面去
Take us to the water!

1266
01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:30.480
我们在盲目飞行 长官
We're flying blind.

1267
01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:32.490
导航系统在重新校准
Navigation's recalibrating after the engine failure.

1268
01:15:32.610 --> 01:15:34.360
太阳升起来了吗
Is the sun coming up?

1269
01:15:35.110 --> 01:15:36.120
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

1270
01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:37.320
那就看着太阳找方向
Then put it on the left.

1271
01:15:37.450 --> 01:15:39.120
把我们带到海面上空
Get us over water.

1272
01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:41.330
再有一个涡轮损毁 我们就会掉下去
One more turbine goes down, and we drop.

1273
01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:44.870
谢谢
Thanks.

1274
01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:49.380
史塔克
Stark!

1275
01:15:52.090 --> 01:15:53.760
史塔克 我在这儿
Stark, I'm here!

1276
01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:55.380
好的
Good.

1277
01:15:56.590 --> 01:15:58.600
我看到你了
Let's see what we've got.

1278
01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:00.390
我要让这个超导制冷系统
I got to get this superconducting coolant system

1279
01:16:00.510 --> 01:16:01.520
重新运转起来
back online

1280
01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:03.100
在我开始工作前
before I can access the rotors,

1281
01:16:03.230 --> 01:16:05.060
你先清理那些障碍物
work on dislodging the debris.

1282
01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:09.150
我需要你到引擎控制箱那儿
I need you to get to that engine control panel

1283
01:16:09.270 --> 01:16:12.940
然后告诉我哪些开关处于过载状态
and tell me which relays are in overload position.

1284
01:16:25.250 --> 01:16:26.790
情况怎么样
What does it look like in there?

1285
01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:30.040
看起来这里只是一堆电路板
It seems to run on some form of electricity.

1286
01:16:30.170 --> 01:16:31.920
哦 很专业
Well, you're not wrong.

1287
01:17:35.730 --> 01:17:38.570
我们不是你的敌人 班纳
We are not your enemies, Banner.

1288
01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:39.700
你冷静点
Try to think!

1289
01:17:49.830 --> 01:17:51.710
好了 这些开关都正常了
Okay, the relays are intact.

1290
01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:53.290
接下来呢
What's our next move?

1291
01:17:53.420 --> 01:17:54.420
即使我搞定了那些齿轮
Even if I clear the rotors,

1292
01:17:54.550 --> 01:17:56.760
这东西没有助推也启动不了
this thing won't re-engage without a jump.

1293
01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:58.260
我得到里面去推一把
I'm going to have to get in there and push.

1294
01:17:58.380 --> 01:18:00.130
启动加速 你会被撕成碎片
If that thing gets up to speed, you'll get shredded.

1295
01:18:00.260 --> 01:18:02.260
那个控制定子的单元 可以反转磁极
That stator control unit can reverse the polarity

1296
01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:03.800
就会有足够长的时间脱离磁悬浮 并且
long enough to disengage maglev and that could...

1297
01:18:03.930 --> 01:18:05.260
说点我能听懂的
Speak English!

1298
01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:07.720
看到那个红色扳手了吗
You see that red lever?

1299
01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:11.150
它能降低转速 这样我就有时间了
It will slow the rotors down long enough for me to get out.

1300
01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:13.060
你守在那儿 等我的指令
Stand by it. Wait for my word.

1301
01:19:05.660 --> 01:19:07.450
传我的命令 全体人员撤离
We need full evac on the lower hangar bay.

1302
01:19:10.660 --> 01:19:11.710
手榴弹
Grenade!

1303
01:19:26.850 --> 01:19:28.180
有敌人侵入
We've got a perimeter breach!

1304
01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:30.350
有敌人闯入神盾局设施
Hostiles are in S.H.I.E.L.D. gear.

1305
01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:32.560
所有人员各就各位
Call-outs at every junction.

1306
01:19:39.860 --> 01:19:42.070
浩克和索尔在第4层研发室
We have the Hulk and Thor on Research Level 4.

1307
01:19:42.190 --> 01:19:43.740
第2层和第3层的监视器坏了
Levels 2 and 3 are dark.

1308
01:19:43.860 --> 01:19:45.990
浩克会把这地方全毁了 长官
Sir, the Hulk will tear this place apart!

1309
01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:48.200
转移他的注意力
Get his attention.

1310
01:19:48.330 --> 01:19:52.500
护航60前往实验室 迎战攻击性目标
Escort 6-0, proceed to Wishbone and engage hostile.

1311
01:19:52.620 --> 01:19:53.910
别靠得太近
Don't get too close.

1312
01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:55.420
收到
Copy.

1313
01:20:07.340 --> 01:20:08.720
发现目标
Target acquired.

1314
01:20:13.020 --> 01:20:14.020
目标锁定
Target engaged.

1315
01:20:25.650 --> 01:20:27.200
目标疯了 目标疯了
Target angry, target angry!

1316
01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:37.810
他们从没来过这边 打什么鬼主意
They're not getting through here, so what the hell...

1317
01:21:51.780 --> 01:21:52.570
故障警报

1318
01:21:52.570 --> 01:21:52.770
故障警报

1319
01:21:52.770 --> 01:21:52.970
故障警报

1320
01:21:52.970 --> 01:21:53.170
故障警报

1321
01:21:53.170 --> 01:21:53.570
故障警报

1322
01:21:52.580 --> 01:21:53.570
1号引擎损毁

1323
01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:58.460
一号引擎被关闭了
Engine one is now in shut-down.

1324
01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:09.050
我们正在失控下落状态 我们在下坠
We are in an uncontrolled descent.

1325
01:22:09.170 --> 01:22:11.050
长官 我们已经完全失去一号引擎的动力
Sir, we've lost all power in engine one.

1326
01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:13.430
巴顿把我们的系统毁了
It's Barton. He took out our systems.

1327
01:22:13.550 --> 01:22:16.060
他往封闭区去了
He's headed for the detention level.

1328
01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:18.140
有人听到吗
Does anybody copy?

1329
01:22:19.310 --> 01:22:21.440
我是罗曼诺夫
This is Agent Romanoff.

1330
01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:23.020
我听到了
I copy.

1331
01:22:27.650 --> 01:22:28.650
史塔克 我们在下坠
Stark, we're losing altitude.

1332
01:22:28.780 --> 01:22:30.240
是啊 我注意到了
Yeah, I noticed.

1333
01:22:59.270 --> 01:23:00.310
不
No!

1334
01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:10.610
这招对你真是屡试不爽
Are you ever not going to fall for that?

1335
01:23:53.610 --> 01:23:55.860
地球人觉得我们是不朽的神
The humans think us immortal.

1336
01:23:56.950 --> 01:23:58.490
要不要试试看
Should we test that?

1337
01:24:01.290 --> 01:24:02.500
请让开一下
Move away, please.

1338
01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:08.460
喜欢这个吗
You like this?

1339
01:24:09.420 --> 01:24:12.670
在你把毁灭者送来后 我们就开始研制这个了
We started working on the prototype after you sent the Destroyer.

1340
01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:16.140
我不知道它能干什么
Even I don't know what it does.

1341
01:24:16.930 --> 01:24:18.180
想见识一下
Do you want to find out?

1342
01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:21.640
不
No!

1343
01:25:31.170 --> 01:25:32.590
娜塔莎
Natasha?

1344
01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:05.910
你输定了
You're going to lose.

1345
01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:09.160
我输了
Am I?

1346
01:26:10.460 --> 01:26:12.960
是命中注定的
It's in your nature.

1347
01:26:15.130 --> 01:26:17.460
你们的英雄四分五裂
Your heroes are scattered.

1348
01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:21.300
你们的堡垒 就要从空中掉下去了
Your floating fortress falls from the sky.

1349
01:26:21.430 --> 01:26:23.050
我还需要担心什么呢
Where is my disadvantage?

1350
01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:25.810
你这个人没有信念
You lack conviction.

1351
01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:27.640
可我不觉得
I don't think I'm...

1352
01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:36.190
原来是干这个用的
So, that's what it does.

1353
01:26:38.100 --> 01:26:40.100
压力不稳定

1354
01:26:38.100 --> 01:26:40.100
警报

1355
01:26:38.100 --> 01:26:40.100
高度

1356
01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:41.450
全体人员 立刻做好坠落冲击准备
All hands to crash stations immediately.

1357
01:27:09.020 --> 01:27:10.020
队长 扳动扳手
Cap, hit the lever.

1358
01:27:10.390 --> 01:27:12.980
稍等一下
I need a minute here!

1359
01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:14.190
扳手
Lever

1360
01:27:14.310 --> 01:27:15.440
快
now!

1361
01:27:27.410 --> 01:27:28.540
救命
Help!

1362
01:28:04.150 --> 01:28:05.530
对不起 头儿
Sorry, boss.

1363
01:28:05.660 --> 01:28:07.370
让那瘟神溜了
The god rabbited.

1364
01:28:07.490 --> 01:28:08.950
保持清醒
Just stay awake.

1365
01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:10.700
没事 看着我
Eyes on me.

1366
01:28:10.830 --> 01:28:12.370
不 我该歇歇了
No, I'm clocking out here.

1367
01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:14.000
你不能歇
Not an option.

1368
01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:16.960
我没事 头儿
It's okay, boss.

1369
01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:20.920
不给他们点动力
This was never gonna work

1370
01:28:21.050 --> 01:28:22.340
他们就永远不会
if they didn't have something

1371
01:28:23.670 --> 01:28:25.220
团结
to...

1372
01:28:54.330 --> 01:28:56.170
科尔森特工阵亡了
Agent Coulson is down.

1373
01:28:57.540 --> 01:28:59.250
医疗小队已经赶过去了
A medical team is on its way to your location.

1374
01:28:59.380 --> 01:29:00.840
他们在这儿
They're here.

1375
01:29:04.050 --> 01:29:05.670
没用了
They called it.

1376
01:29:22.150 --> 01:29:23.780
这是在科尔森特工的外套里发现的
These were in Phil Coulson's jacket.

1377
01:29:27.110 --> 01:29:29.240
他永远都没有机会找你签名了
I guess he never did get you to sign them.

1378
01:29:32.740 --> 01:29:34.410
我们处于盲目的状态
We're dead in the air up here.

1379
01:29:34.540 --> 01:29:37.620
通讯坏了 无法找到魔方
Our communications, the location of the Cube,

1380
01:29:37.750 --> 01:29:40.170
班纳 索尔 也都不见了
Banner, Thor...

1381
01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:43.380
我也无能为力
I got nothing for you.

1382
01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:46.420
我失去了最优秀的心腹
I lost my one good eye.

1383
01:29:49.470 --> 01:29:52.470
也许我自作自受
Maybe I had that coming.

1384
01:29:56.680 --> 01:29:57.980
没错
Yes,

1385
01:29:59.140 --> 01:30:02.480
我们原本是打算用魔方制造武器的
we were going to build an arsenal with the Tesseract.

1386
01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:07.480
无聊老生制作

1387
01:30:03.940 --> 01:30:05.860
但是我 没有把赌注下到这上面
I never put all my chips on that number, though

1388
01:30:05.980 --> 01:30:09.030
而是用在了某个更风险的项目上
because I was playing something even riskier.

1389
01:30:12.990 --> 01:30:17.120
那是我的理想 史塔克应该知道
There was an idea, Stark knows this,

1390
01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:22.330
我们称作 复仇者方案
called the Avengers Initiative.

1391
01:30:23.540 --> 01:30:25.670
这个想法就是把世界上最卓越的人
The idea was to bring together a group

1392
01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:28.340
都聚在一起
of remarkable people

1393
01:30:29.130 --> 01:30:31.970
看他们是否能发挥更大的作用
to see if they could become something more.

1394
01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:37.520
在我们最需要他们的时候 他们能够齐心协力
To see if they could work together when we needed them to,

1395
01:30:37.640 --> 01:30:40.980
一起对抗我们没把握打败的敌人
to fight the battles that we never could.

1396
01:30:43.730 --> 01:30:48.570
科尔森至死都坚信这个理想 他相信
Phil Coulson died still believing in that idea.

1397
01:30:50.900 --> 01:30:52.570
英雄的存在
In heroes.

1398
01:31:00.660 --> 01:31:02.210
好吧
Well,

1399
01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:05.750
这是个有些老套的概念
it's an old-fashioned notion.

1400
01:31:26.060 --> 01:31:28.570
你从天上掉了下来
You fell out of the sky.

1401
01:31:42.580 --> 01:31:44.080
我伤到什么人了吗
Did I hurt anybody?

1402
01:31:44.210 --> 01:31:47.250
这儿没什么人能让你伤的
There's nobody around here to get hurt.

1403
01:31:47.380 --> 01:31:50.670
倒是让你吓坏了不少鸽子
You did scare the hell out of some pigeons, though.

1404
01:31:51.510 --> 01:31:52.550
太好了
Lucky.

1405
01:31:52.670 --> 01:31:54.300
你运气真好
Or just good aim.

1406
01:31:54.430 --> 01:31:56.010
掉下来的时候还醒着
You were awake when you fell.

1407
01:31:58.100 --> 01:31:59.140
你看到了
You saw?

1408
01:31:59.140 --> 01:32:00.140
全过程
The whole thing.

1409
01:32:00.270 --> 01:32:01.890
砸穿天花板掉下来
Right through the ceiling.

1410
01:32:02.020 --> 01:32:05.980
光着屁股的绿色大块头
Big and green and buck-ass nude.

1411
01:32:06.100 --> 01:32:07.230
给你
Here.

1412
01:32:08.610 --> 01:32:10.780
我估摸着等你恢复正常尺寸后
Didn't think those would fit you until you shrunk down

1413
01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:13.320
就能穿下这个了
to a regular-size feller.

1414
01:32:15.660 --> 01:32:16.950
谢谢了
Thank you.

1415
01:32:17.950 --> 01:32:19.200
你是外星人
Are you an alien?

1416
01:32:19.790 --> 01:32:20.990
什么
What?

1417
01:32:21.290 --> 01:32:22.620
外太空的外星人
From outer space, an alien.

1418
01:32:23.250 --> 01:32:24.250
不是
No.

1419
01:32:24.620 --> 01:32:27.750
那么 年轻人 你病得可不轻
Well, then, son, you've got a condition.

1420
01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:40.930
巴顿 你肯定会没事的
Clint. You're going to be all right.

1421
01:32:44.270 --> 01:32:46.350
你怎么知道
You know that?

1422
01:32:47.190 --> 01:32:49.060
我没时间了
Is that what you know?

1423
01:32:51.530 --> 01:32:54.400
我得把它
I've got no window.

1424
01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:56.570
从我大脑里赶出去
I have to flush him out.

1425
01:32:57.490 --> 01:32:59.320
你需要花点时间才能恢复正常
You got to level out. It's going to take time.

1426
01:32:59.450 --> 01:33:00.990
你不会明白的
You don't understand.

1427
01:33:02.950 --> 01:33:06.210
你从来没让别人控制过你的大脑
Have you ever had someone take your brain and play?

1428
01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:11.170
把真正的你挤跑 塞进别的东西进去
Pull you out and stuff something else in?

1429
01:33:14.340 --> 01:33:16.720
你知道被摧垮是什么感觉吗
Do you know what it's like to be unmade?

1430
01:33:18.260 --> 01:33:20.640
你知道我也经历过
You know that I do.

1431
01:33:28.230 --> 01:33:29.270
我怎么醒的
Why am I back?

1432
01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:31.770
你怎么赶走它的
How did you get him out?

1433
01:33:31.900 --> 01:33:34.740
重新校准意识
Cognitive recalibration.

1434
01:33:34.860 --> 01:33:37.570
我狠敲了你的脑袋
I hit you really hard on the head.

1435
01:33:37.700 --> 01:33:38.780
谢谢
Thanks.

1436
01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:44.830
娜塔莎
Natasha...

1437
01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:46.580
有多少特工被我
How many agents did I...

1438
01:33:46.710 --> 01:33:48.170
别去想了
Don't.

1439
01:33:48.290 --> 01:33:50.500
不要增加自己的负罪感
Don't do that to yourself, Clint.

1440
01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:52.800
都是洛基干的
This is Loki.

1441
01:33:52.920 --> 01:33:55.550
他们是  妖魔鬼怪
This is monsters and magic,

1442
01:33:55.670 --> 01:33:57.300
我们没有经受过这方面的训练
and nothing we were ever trained for.

1443
01:33:57.420 --> 01:33:58.970
洛基 他逃走了
Loki, did he get away?

1444
01:33:59.090 --> 01:34:00.090
是的
Yeah.

1445
01:34:00.430 --> 01:34:02.680
你应该知道他去哪儿
I don't suppose you know where.

1446
01:34:02.810 --> 01:34:04.600
他从不告诉我
I didn't need to know.

1447
01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:06.480
我也不问
I didn't ask.

1448
01:34:09.730 --> 01:34:12.230
他应该很快实施他的计划
He's going to make his play soon, though.

1449
01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:13.570
在今天
Today.

1450
01:34:13.690 --> 01:34:15.030
我们需要阻止他
We got to stop him.

1451
01:34:15.690 --> 01:34:16.940
我们 还有谁
Yeah? Who's "we"?

1452
01:34:17.070 --> 01:34:19.030
不知道 剩下的人吧
I don't know. Whoever's left.

1453
01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:21.570
好吧
Well,

1454
01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:25.450
如果我能 往洛基的眼睛里射一箭
if I put an arrow through Loki's eye socket,

1455
01:34:25.580 --> 01:34:28.290
我会睡得香一点
I would sleep better, I suppose.

1456
01:34:31.130 --> 01:34:32.710
你终于正常了
Now you sound like you.

1457
01:34:33.420 --> 01:34:34.880
可你不正常
But you don't.

1458
01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:39.630
你是间谍 不是战士
You're a spy, not a soldier.

1459
01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:44.510
过去你不是这样 现在你想上前线 为什么
Now you want to wade into a war. Why?

1460
01:34:46.270 --> 01:34:48.230
洛基怎么你了
What did Loki do to you?

1461
01:34:48.980 --> 01:34:51.400
他怎么我 只是
He didn't. I just...

1462
01:34:55.150 --> 01:34:56.690
娜塔莎
Natasha.

1463
01:34:58.780 --> 01:35:00.780
我有点动摇了
I've been compromised.

1464
01:35:03.870 --> 01:35:05.990
我欠的血债太多
I got red in my ledger.

1465
01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:10.210
我想还债
I would like to wipe it out.

1466
01:35:26.220 --> 01:35:27.720
他结婚了
Was he married?

1467
01:35:27.850 --> 01:35:29.270
没有
No.

1468
01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:33.600
他有个 拉大提琴的女朋友
There was a cellist, I think.

1469
01:35:35.190 --> 01:35:36.610
我很难过
I'm sorry.

1470
01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:38.980
他看起来人很好
He seemed like a good man.

1471
01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:41.360
他太傻了
He was an idiot.

1472
01:35:41.490 --> 01:35:43.740
为什么 为了信念
Why? For believing?

1473
01:35:43.860 --> 01:35:45.280
他一个人去对付洛基
For taking on Loki alone.

1474
01:35:45.410 --> 01:35:47.120
他是尽守职责
He was doing his job.

1475
01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:49.790
超出了他的能力范围 他应该等待援军
He was out of his league. He should have waited.

1476
01:35:49.910 --> 01:35:50.950
他应该
He should have...

1477
01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:52.660
有时候 你会不由自主的
Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony.

1478
01:35:52.790 --> 01:35:54.920
这话 我以前也听过
Right, I've heard that before.

1479
01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:56.540
你第一次看到战士阵亡吗
Is this the first time you lost a soldier?

1480
01:35:56.670 --> 01:35:58.460
可我们不是战士
We are not soldiers.

1481
01:36:02.930 --> 01:36:04.680
我没打算听弗瑞摆布
I'm not marching to Fury's fife.

1482
01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:05.970
我也是
Neither am I.

1483
01:36:06.090 --> 01:36:08.310
他和洛基都要为科尔森的死负责
He's got the same blood on his hands that Loki does.

1484
01:36:08.430 --> 01:36:12.140
但是现在我们必须要以大局为重
But right now, we got to put that behind us and get this done.

1485
01:36:12.270 --> 01:36:13.270
洛基需要一个能量源
Loki needs a power source.

1486
01:36:13.390 --> 01:36:14.390
如果我们能
If we can put together a list...

1487
01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:15.520
他想张扬个性
He made it personal.

1488
01:36:15.690 --> 01:36:16.730
这无关紧要
That's not the point.

1489
01:36:16.860 --> 01:36:19.230
这很重要 这就是他的个性
That is the point. That's Loki's point.

1490
01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:21.280
他对我们的背景都了若指掌 为什么
He hit us all right where we live. Why?

1491
01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:22.400
让我们内讧
To tear us apart.

1492
01:36:22.530 --> 01:36:24.400
对 各个击破
Yeah, divide and conquer is great

1493
01:36:24.530 --> 01:36:26.990
太妙了 但他知道要想获胜的唯一办法
but he knows he has to take us out to win, right?

1494
01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:28.660
就得把我们都击败
That's what he wants.

1495
01:36:28.780 --> 01:36:31.290
想要打败我们 还想要别人来见证这一刻
He wants to beat us, he wants to be seen doing it.

1496
01:36:31.410 --> 01:36:32.540
他想要观众
He wants an audience.

1497
01:36:33.250 --> 01:36:34.920
没错 在斯图加特就是这样
Right. I caught his act in Stuttgart.

1498
01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:37.960
对 那个只是预告片 今天才是重头戏
Yeah, that was just previews. This is opening night.

1499
01:36:38.090 --> 01:36:40.630
洛基是个标准自大狂
And Loki, he's a full-tilt diva, right?

1500
01:36:40.750 --> 01:36:42.340
他想要鲜花 渴望掌声
He wants flowers, he wants parades.

1501
01:36:42.460 --> 01:36:46.260
想要个标志性建筑物 让他的名字能高高在上
He wants a monument built to the skies with his name plastered...

1502
01:36:48.010 --> 01:36:49.600
这个混蛋
Son of a bitch.

1503
01:37:00.860 --> 01:37:01.900
该走了
Time to go.

1504
01:37:02.030 --> 01:37:03.570
- 去哪儿  - 路上告诉你
- Go where? - I'll tell you on the way.

1505
01:37:03.690 --> 01:37:04.700
你会开飞机吗
Can you fly one of those jets?

1506
01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:07.530
我会
I can.

1507
01:37:11.410 --> 01:37:12.450
你有制服吗
You got a suit?

1508
01:37:12.580 --> 01:37:13.580
有
Yeah.

1509
01:37:13.700 --> 01:37:15.160
那就穿上
Then suit up.

1510
01:37:42.820 --> 01:37:44.110
嗨 你们几个不能到这儿来
Hey, you guys aren't authorised to be in here.

1511
01:37:44.230 --> 01:37:46.570
小伙子 对不起了
Son, just don't.

1512
01:37:48.610 --> 01:37:49.620
长官
Sir.

1513
01:37:49.740 --> 01:37:50.950
希尔特工
Agent Hill.

1514
01:37:51.490 --> 01:37:53.040
那些卡片
Those cards,

1515
01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:59.630
是放在科尔森的衣物柜里的 不在他的外套
they were in Coulson's locker, not in his jacket.

1516
01:38:04.050 --> 01:38:05.630
他们需要一些动力
They needed the push.

1517
01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:11.010
有人未经授权 从6号停机坪起飞了
We have an unauthorised departure from Bay 6.

1518
01:38:11.890 --> 01:38:13.220
找到洛基了
They found him.

1519
01:38:14.060 --> 01:38:17.770
不惜一切手段马上恢复通讯系统
Get our communications back up, whatever you have to do.

1520
01:38:17.890 --> 01:38:19.150
我要随时掌握情况
I want eyes on everything.

1521
01:38:19.150 --> 01:38:20.150
是 长官
Yes, sir.

1522
01:38:21.150 --> 01:38:24.150
美国 纽约
America New York

1523
01:38:33.700 --> 01:38:35.450
先生 我们关闭了方舟反应堆
Sir, I've turned off the arc reactor

1524
01:38:35.580 --> 01:38:39.410
但是魔方已经在持续供能了
but the device is already self-sustaining.

1525
01:38:39.540 --> 01:38:41.710
关上它 席尔维格博士
Shut it down, Dr Selvig.

1526
01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:43.670
太晚了
It's too late!

1527
01:38:45.710 --> 01:38:47.170
它已经停不下来了
She can't stop now.

1528
01:38:48.220 --> 01:38:50.680
它要向我们展示一个
She wants to show us something!

1529
01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:52.850
全新的宇宙
A new universe.

1530
01:38:52.970 --> 01:38:54.510
好吧
Okay.

1531
01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:03.440
那是纯能量构成的
The barrier is pure energy.

1532
01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:05.440
无法穿透
It's unbreachable.

1533
01:39:05.570 --> 01:39:07.360
对 我发现了
Yeah, I got that.

1534
01:39:08.570 --> 01:39:09.570
B计划
Plan B.

1535
01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:12.820
先生 马克7型还没做好实战准备
Sir, the Mark 7 is not ready for deployment.

1536
01:39:12.950 --> 01:39:15.200
那就别管它 我们时间紧迫
Then skip the spinning rims. We're on the clock.

1537
01:39:34.930 --> 01:39:37.970
你是来打算求我对你开恩的吧
Please tell me you're going to appeal to my humanity.

1538
01:39:39.100 --> 01:39:41.480
呃 其实 我是来要胁你的
Actually, I'm planning to threaten you.

1539
01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:43.060
那你至少应该穿着护甲
You should have left your armour on for that.

1540
01:39:43.190 --> 01:39:44.610
是啊
Yeah.

1541
01:39:44.730 --> 01:39:45.810
可惜不好用
It's seen a bit of mileage,

1542
01:39:45.940 --> 01:39:48.570
而且你还拿着那个 明晃晃的法杖
and you've got the glow stick of destiny.

1543
01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:51.650
喝一杯吗
Would you like a drink?

1544
01:39:51.780 --> 01:39:52.910
拖延我救不了你
Stalling me won't change anything.

1545
01:39:53.030 --> 01:39:55.160
不不 是威胁
No, no. Threatening.

1546
01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:56.660
你真不喝吗
No drink? Are you sure?

1547
01:39:56.780 --> 01:39:58.330
那我自己喝
I'm having one.

1548
01:39:59.370 --> 01:40:03.290
我的人马上就到 你们已经完蛋了
The Chitauri are coming. Nothing will change that.

1549
01:40:04.170 --> 01:40:05.580
我有什么好怕的
What have I to fear?

1550
01:40:05.710 --> 01:40:07.420
复仇者联盟
The Avengers.

1551
01:40:09.510 --> 01:40:11.840
我们这么称呼自己 算是个团队
That's what we call ourselves. We're sort of like a team.

1552
01:40:11.970 --> 01:40:13.590
世上最强英雄联盟
"Earth's mightiest heroes"-type thing.

1553
01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:15.590
对 我见识过
Yes, I've met them.

1554
01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:16.760
嗯
Yeah.

1555
01:40:16.890 --> 01:40:18.060
不过我们花了点时间才搞清楚
It takes us a while to get any traction, I'll give you that one.

1556
01:40:18.180 --> 01:40:21.520
让我给你清点一下人头
But let's do a head count, here.

1557
01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:24.140
你的兄弟 那个小帅哥
Your brother, the demigod,

1558
01:40:25.850 --> 01:40:29.440
超级英雄 一个不死的不负盛名的传奇
a super soldier, a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend.

1559
01:40:29.570 --> 01:40:32.740
一个脾气发作就要人命的大块头
A man with breathtaking anger-management issues,

1560
01:40:32.860 --> 01:40:35.950
还有一对精英杀手 而你呢 倒楣蛋
a couple of master assassins, and you, big fella,

1561
01:40:36.570 --> 01:40:39.540
你把他们每个人都惹毛了
you've managed to piss off every single one of them.

1562
01:40:39.660 --> 01:40:40.660
正是我的计划
That was the plan.

1563
01:40:40.790 --> 01:40:42.790
很烂的计划
Not a great plan.

1564
01:40:42.910 --> 01:40:44.960
他们来的时候
When they come,

1565
01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:46.540
他们肯定会来
and they will,

1566
01:40:46.670 --> 01:40:47.920
会来找你算账
they'll come for you.

1567
01:40:48.040 --> 01:40:49.040
我有支军队
I have an army.

1568
01:40:49.170 --> 01:40:50.340
我们有浩克
We have a Hulk.

1569
01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:52.210
我以为那怪物走丢了
I thought the beast had wandered off.

1570
01:40:52.340 --> 01:40:54.260
你还是没搞清楚状况
You're missing the point. There is no throne.

1571
01:40:54.380 --> 01:40:58.390
你永远坐不上王位 没有一种可能性会让你成功
There is no version of this where you come out on top.

1572
01:40:58.510 --> 01:41:00.850
也许你的军队会来 而且我们可能打不过
Maybe your army comes and maybe it's too much for us,

1573
01:41:00.970 --> 01:41:02.980
但我们都会来找你
but it's all on you.

1574
01:41:03.770 --> 01:41:04.850
如果地球失守了
Because if we can't protect the Earth,

1575
01:41:05.020 --> 01:41:08.150
我们肯定会来找你复仇
you can be damn well sure we'll avenge it.

1576
01:41:10.190 --> 01:41:13.240
如果你跟朋友们反目成仇
How will your friends have time for me

1577
01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:15.150
他们就没时间来找我了
when they are so busy fighting you?

1578
01:41:22.580 --> 01:41:23.620
我从没失误过
This usually works.

1579
01:41:23.750 --> 01:41:26.580
发挥失常很难免 好了 别那么自责
Well, performance issues, it's not uncommon.

1580
01:41:26.710 --> 01:41:28.630
谁还没
One out of five...

1581
01:41:30.090 --> 01:41:33.010
贾维斯 还等什么
Jarvis, anytime now.

1582
01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:37.510
你们都会 跪在我面前
You will all fall before me.

1583
01:41:37.630 --> 01:41:39.010
启动
Deploy!

1584
01:41:39.140 --> 01:41:40.550
快启动
Deploy!

1585
01:42:07.750 --> 01:42:10.710
你还得罪了另一个人
And there's one other person you pissed off.

1586
01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:13.090
科尔森特工
His name was Phil.

1587
01:42:36.860 --> 01:42:38.360
来吧
Right.

1588
01:42:38.490 --> 01:42:39.740
军队
Army.

1589
01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:53.400
洛基
Loki!

1590
01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:55.560
马上关闭魔方 不然我就毁了它
Turn off the Tesseract, or I'll destroy it.

1591
01:43:55.690 --> 01:43:56.730
你做不到的
You can't.

1592
01:43:56.860 --> 01:43:58.730
已经无法阻止它了
There is no stopping it.

1593
01:43:58.860 --> 01:44:00.650
现在只有
There is only

1594
01:44:00.780 --> 01:44:01.900
战争
the war.

1595
01:44:02.030 --> 01:44:03.160
那好吧
So be it.

1596
01:44:25.260 --> 01:44:27.010
史塔克 我们在你右侧
Stark, we're on your three, headed northeast.

1597
01:44:27.140 --> 01:44:29.260
你们是坐牛车来的吗
What? Did you stop for drive-through?

1598
01:44:29.390 --> 01:44:31.100
去帕克大街 我把他们引过去
Swing up Park. I'm going to lay them out for you.

1599
01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:50.490
先生 又来了很多
Sir, we have more incoming.

1600
01:44:50.620 --> 01:44:52.370
好 别让他们闲着
Fine. Let's keep them occupied.

1601
01:44:59.250 --> 01:45:01.130
- 娜塔莎  - 我看见了
- Nat? - I see him.

1602
01:45:45.470 --> 01:45:47.680
我们得到上面去
We got to get back up there.

1603
01:46:39.020 --> 01:46:40.690
史塔克 你看见了吗
Stark, are you seeing this?

1604
01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:43.900
看见了 但我还无法相信
Seeing. Still working on believing.

1605
01:46:44.020 --> 01:46:45.400
班纳在哪儿 他还没来吗
Where's Banner? Has he shown up yet?

1606
01:46:45.530 --> 01:46:46.570
班纳
Banner?

1607
01:46:46.690 --> 01:46:47.740
有消息立刻告诉我
Just keep me posted.

1608
01:46:48.450 --> 01:46:50.610
贾维斯 帮我找到它的弱点
Jarvis, find me a soft spot.

1609
01:46:52.870 --> 01:46:54.740
你看看这个
Look at this!

1610
01:46:54.870 --> 01:46:55.870
看看你周围
Look around you!

1611
01:46:56.870 --> 01:47:00.750
你以为这些会随着你的统治终结吗
You think this madness will end with your rule?

1612
01:47:00.870 --> 01:47:02.380
太晚了
It's too late.

1613
01:47:03.880 --> 01:47:05.130
要阻止它已经太晚了
It's too late to stop it.

1614
01:47:05.250 --> 01:47:09.130
不 我们一起 阻止它
No. We can, together.

1615
01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:17.850
多愁善感
Sentiment.

1616
01:47:45.420 --> 01:47:47.960
还有不少人被困在里面
We've got civilians still trapped up here.

1617
01:47:49.130 --> 01:47:50.130
洛基
Loki.

1618
01:48:01.770 --> 01:48:03.560
他们需要我们的帮助
They're fish in a barrel down there.

1619
01:48:09.030 --> 01:48:10.990
我们对付 你走
We got this. It's good. Go.

1620
01:48:11.110 --> 01:48:12.490
你们两个能挡住吗
Do you think you can hold them off?

1621
01:48:12.610 --> 01:48:13.610
队长
Captain,

1622
01:48:15.620 --> 01:48:18.450
我们是心甘情愿的
it would be my genuine pleasure.

1623
01:48:45.310 --> 01:48:47.020
这场面让我想起了布达佩斯
Just like Budapest all over again.

1624
01:48:47.650 --> 01:48:50.150
看来我们俩对布达佩斯的印象完全不同
You and I remember Budapest very differently.

1625
01:49:06.290 --> 01:49:08.710
长官 国民警卫队要一个小时才能到
It's going to be an hour before they can scramble the National Guard.

1626
01:49:08.840 --> 01:49:10.630
国民警卫队
National Guard?

1627
01:49:11.590 --> 01:49:13.090
军队知道这儿的情况吗
Does the army know what's happening here?

1628
01:49:13.340 --> 01:49:14.340
我怎么知道
Do we?

1629
01:49:15.550 --> 01:49:16.760
快去 在这些楼里布置人手
You need men in these buildings.

1630
01:49:16.890 --> 01:49:18.390
那里还有不少人
There are people inside and they're going to be running

1631
01:49:18.510 --> 01:49:19.720
他们的处境非常危险
right into the line of fire.

1632
01:49:19.850 --> 01:49:21.770
带他们从地下室 或者地铁撤离
You take them to the basements or through the subway.

1633
01:49:21.890 --> 01:49:23.480
不要让他们到街上来
You keep them off the streets.

1634
01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:26.230
我需要从这儿到39街 建立阵地
I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.

1635
01:49:26.350 --> 01:49:27.980
我干嘛要听你的指挥
Why the hell should I take orders from you?

1636
01:49:42.040 --> 01:49:43.250
挑几个人到楼里去
I need men in those buildings.

1637
01:49:43.370 --> 01:49:45.460
把里面的人都带到地下室 知道了
Lead the people down and away from the streets.

1638
01:49:45.580 --> 01:49:48.170
从这儿到39街 马上建立阵地
We're going to set up a perimeter all the way down to 39th Street.

1639
01:49:58.550 --> 01:50:00.140
好了 引起它的注意了
Well, we got its attention.

1640
01:50:00.260 --> 01:50:02.140
下一步该怎么办
What the hell was step two?

1641
01:50:31.670 --> 01:50:32.670
上面什么情况
What's the story upstairs?

1642
01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:34.710
无法穿透魔方周围的能量
The power surrounding the Cube is impenetrable.

1643
01:50:34.840 --> 01:50:37.470
他说得对 得先对付这些家伙
Thor's right. We got to deal with these guys.

1644
01:50:37.590 --> 01:50:39.220
- 我们该怎么做  - 团队合作
- How do we do this? - As a team.

1645
01:50:39.340 --> 01:50:40.640
我和洛基还有账没算完
I have unfinished business with Loki.

1646
01:50:41.180 --> 01:50:42.220
是吗  那你得排队
Yeah? Well, get in line.

1647
01:50:42.350 --> 01:50:43.350
好了
Save it.

1648
01:50:43.470 --> 01:50:44.810
洛基肯定会集中他的所有兵力
Loki's going to keep this fight focused on us,

1649
01:50:44.930 --> 01:50:45.970
来对付我们
and that's what we need.

1650
01:50:46.100 --> 01:50:47.770
除掉他 他们就会乱套
Without him, these things could run wild.

1651
01:50:47.890 --> 01:50:50.850
史塔克在天上 他会需要我们
We got Stark up top. He's going to need us to...

1652
01:50:58.200 --> 01:51:01.990
啊 看起来情况 很糟糕
So, this all seems horrible.

1653
01:51:02.450 --> 01:51:03.580
我见过更糟的
I've seen worse.

1654
01:51:04.120 --> 01:51:05.120
对不起
Sorry.

1655
01:51:05.240 --> 01:51:07.910
没关系 我们现在 需要更糟的
No, we could use a little worse.

1656
01:51:08.040 --> 01:51:09.460
史塔克 我们找到他了
Stark, we got him.

1657
01:51:09.460 --> 01:51:10.460
班纳
Banner?

1658
01:51:10.580 --> 01:51:11.830
没错 是他
Just like you said.

1659
01:51:11.960 --> 01:51:14.670
叫他做好准备 狂欢就要开始了
Then tell him to suit up. I'm bringing the party to you.

1660
01:51:21.140 --> 01:51:23.220
我 我不觉得这值得狂欢
I don't see how that's a party.

1661
01:51:31.060 --> 01:51:32.060
班纳博士
Dr Banner.

1662
01:51:33.810 --> 01:51:35.610
现在可是你应该发怒的好时候了
Now might be a really good time for you to get angry.

1663
01:51:36.650 --> 01:51:39.110
告诉你个秘密 队长
That's my secret, Captain.

1664
01:51:40.820 --> 01:51:42.070
我一直很愤怒
I'm always angry.

1665
01:51:53.540 --> 01:51:55.170
坚持住
Hold on!

1666
01:52:25.070 --> 01:52:26.620
全体出动
Send the rest.

1667
01:52:33.370 --> 01:52:34.630
各位
Guys.

1668
01:52:34.750 --> 01:52:35.960
下令吧 队长
Call it, Captain.

1669
01:52:36.080 --> 01:52:37.250
都听好了
All right, listen up.

1670
01:52:37.380 --> 01:52:40.170
在关闭传送门前 先牵制住他们
Until we can close that portal, our priority is containment.

1671
01:52:40.300 --> 01:52:41.630
巴顿 你到屋顶上去
Barton, I want you on that roof.

1672
01:52:41.760 --> 01:52:43.630
找出那些家伙的行进路线
Eyes on everything. Call out patterns and strays.

1673
01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:45.140
史塔克 你坚守阵地
Stark, you got the perimeter.

1674
01:52:45.260 --> 01:52:46.430
任何靠近这三条街的东西
Anything gets more than three blocks out,

1675
01:52:46.550 --> 01:52:48.100
逼他们撤退 要不就烧成灰
you turn it back or you turn it to ash.

1676
01:52:48.220 --> 01:52:49.430
- 能捎我一程吗  - 抓紧
- Can you give me a lift? - Right.

1677
01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:50.640
小心别掉下去
Better clench up, Legolas.

1678
01:52:54.230 --> 01:52:56.610
索尔 你得想办法挡住传送门
Thor, you got to try and bottleneck that portal.

1679
01:52:56.730 --> 01:52:57.900
拖住他们
Slow them down.

1680
01:52:58.020 --> 01:53:00.190
可以召唤闪电 把他们烧得精光
You got the lightning. Light the bastards up.

1681
01:53:02.490 --> 01:53:04.110
你和我 我们俩得把战场
You and me, we stay here on the ground.

1682
01:53:04.240 --> 01:53:05.280
控制在地面上
We keep the fighting here.

1683
01:53:05.410 --> 01:53:06.410
浩克
And Hulk...

1684
01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:10.200
看你的了
Smash.

1685
01:54:03.800 --> 01:54:04.920
长官
Sir.

1686
01:54:05.970 --> 01:54:06.970
议员们在线上
The Council is on.

1687
01:54:11.850 --> 01:54:15.100
史塔克 你身后有不少跟屁虫
Stark, you got a lot of strays sniffing your tail.

1688
01:54:16.940 --> 01:54:18.980
我正在 想办法甩开他们
I'm just trying to keep them off the streets.

1689
01:54:19.100 --> 01:54:21.360
我看他们转向很差
Well, they can't bank worth a damn.

1690
01:54:21.480 --> 01:54:22.650
去找个急转弯
So find a tight corner.

1691
01:54:22.770 --> 01:54:24.110
好极了 收到
I will roger that.

1692
01:54:47.090 --> 01:54:48.260
哦 来吧
Oh, boy.

1693
01:54:55.270 --> 01:54:56.890
干得好
Nice call.

1694
01:54:57.020 --> 01:54:58.230
接下来呢
What else you got?

1695
01:54:58.350 --> 01:55:01.150
索尔在六街 和一个小队恶战
Thor is taking on a squadron down on Sixth.

1696
01:55:01.270 --> 01:55:03.480
这家伙竟然没邀请我
And he didn't invite me.

1697
01:55:42.980 --> 01:55:44.610
传送门如果不关上
Captain, none of this is going to mean a damn thing

1698
01:55:44.730 --> 01:55:45.980
他们怎么也杀不完
if we don't close that portal.

1699
01:55:46.110 --> 01:55:47.780
任何武器都没办法
Our biggest guns couldn't touch it.

1700
01:55:47.900 --> 01:55:50.150
也许和武器无关
Well, maybe it's not about guns.

1701
01:55:52.070 --> 01:55:54.030
要到上面去 我们需要车
If you want to get up there, you're going to need a ride.

1702
01:55:55.120 --> 01:55:56.200
我倒有车
I got a ride.

1703
01:55:57.330 --> 01:55:58.370
但需要点帮助
I could use a boost, though.

1704
01:56:00.960 --> 01:56:01.960
你真这么做
Are you sure about this?

1705
01:56:02.420 --> 01:56:04.960
对 肯定刺激
Yeah. It's gonna be fun.

1706
01:56:31.990 --> 01:56:33.860
转向 转向
Okay, turn, turn.

1707
01:56:33.990 --> 01:56:35.740
快点 快点
Less! Less!

1708
01:57:51.400 --> 01:57:52.900
中央火车站42大街站

1709
01:57:52.900 --> 01:57:54.100
中央火车站42大街站

1710
01:57:58.450 --> 01:58:01.410
队长 42街麦迪逊路口的银行
Captain, the bank on 42nd past Madison.

1711
01:58:01.540 --> 01:58:03.290
有人被困在里面了
They've cornered a lot of civilians in there.

1712
01:58:03.410 --> 01:58:05.330
我马上来
I'm on it.

1713
01:58:25.430 --> 01:58:27.230
大家快让开
Everyone! Clear out!

1714
01:58:57.130 --> 01:58:58.800
弗瑞指挥官
Director Fury,

1715
01:58:58.930 --> 01:59:00.720
议会已经做出决定了
the Council has made a decision.

1716
01:59:00.840 --> 01:59:03.600
我知道他们会的 而且也清楚
I recognise the Council has made a decision.

1717
01:59:03.600 --> 01:59:05.310
他们会做出什么样的愚蠢决定
But given that it's a stupid-ass decision,

1718
01:59:05.430 --> 01:59:06.850
所以我想我应该忽略它
I have elected to ignore it.

1719
01:59:06.980 --> 01:59:10.310
指挥官 你的战舰最靠近战场
Director, you're closer than any of our subs.

1720
01:59:08.500 --> 01:59:11.510
加密线路通话

1721
01:59:10.440 --> 01:59:11.440
请下令让战机马上
You scramble that jet...

1722
01:59:11.560 --> 01:59:14.270
那可是曼哈顿岛 议员们
That is the island of Manhattan, Councilman.

1723
01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:16.490
除非我的小组无法阻止它们
Until I'm certain my team can't hold it,

1724
01:59:16.610 --> 01:59:18.570
否则我绝不会下令用核武器
I will not order a nuclear strike

1725
01:59:18.740 --> 01:59:20.160
攻击任何平民的
against a civilian population.

1726
01:59:20.280 --> 01:59:22.700
如果不能阻止他们一切就都完了
If we don't hold them here, we lose everything.

1727
01:59:20.350 --> 01:59:22.800
加密线路通话

1728
01:59:22.830 --> 01:59:25.580
如果发射核弹那才真完了
If I send that bird out, we already have.

1729
01:59:29.330 --> 01:59:31.040
又是你
You.

1730
01:59:33.290 --> 01:59:34.460
巴顿
Hawkeye!

1731
01:59:35.920 --> 01:59:36.920
你在干什么
Nat, what are you doing?

1732
01:59:37.840 --> 01:59:38.840
帮个忙
A little help?

1733
01:59:44.140 --> 01:59:45.140
瞄准了
I got him.

1734
02:00:11.710 --> 02:00:12.710
够了
Enough!

1735
02:00:13.040 --> 02:00:15.500
你们这些卑微低贱的人
You are, all of you, beneath me!

1736
02:00:15.630 --> 02:00:18.380
我是个神 我告诉你们
I am a god, you dull creature.

1737
02:00:18.510 --> 02:00:20.010
我才不会被蚂蚁给
And I will not be bullied by...

1738
02:00:29.850 --> 02:00:31.730
可怜的神
Puny god.

1739
02:00:39.860 --> 02:00:41.320
他的权杖
The sceptre...

1740
02:00:42.490 --> 02:00:43.700
博士
Doctor.

1741
02:00:45.570 --> 02:00:48.410
洛基的权杖 那股能量
Loki's sceptre. The energy.

1742
02:00:48.540 --> 02:00:50.200
魔方无法对抗
The Tesseract can't fight,

1743
02:00:50.330 --> 02:00:52.370
因为它 不能和自己对抗
but you can't protect against yourself.

1744
02:00:52.500 --> 02:00:53.500
这不是你的错
It's not your fault.

1745
02:00:53.620 --> 02:00:54.880
你被他控制了
You didn't know what you were doing.

1746
02:00:57.920 --> 02:01:00.090
我好像记得
Actually, I think I did.

1747
02:01:00.210 --> 02:01:03.180
我做了个保险装置
I built in a safety to cut their power source.

1748
02:01:04.380 --> 02:01:05.800
洛基的权杖
Loki's sceptre.

1749
02:01:05.930 --> 02:01:08.510
权杖能关上传送门
It may be able to close the portal.

1750
02:01:10.600 --> 02:01:12.770
它就在我眼前
And I'm looking right at it.

1751
02:01:24.740 --> 02:01:28.620
先生 穿透它的壳之前 能量会用完的
Sir, we will lose power before we penetrate that shell.

1752
02:01:35.250 --> 02:01:38.540
贾维斯 知道约拿的典故吗
Jarvis, you ever hear the tale of Jonah?

1753
02:01:38.670 --> 02:01:41.050
我  不会把他当成榜样的
I wouldn't consider him a role model.

1754
02:02:50.660 --> 02:02:52.450
弗瑞指挥官已被停职
Director Fury is no longer in command.

1755
02:02:52.580 --> 02:02:54.620
执行命令 7A11

7A11已确认 我准备起飞
7-Alpha-1-1, confirmed. We're go for takeoff.

1757
02:02:58.210 --> 02:03:00.290
长官 甲板上有异常
Sir, we have a bird in motion!

1758
02:03:00.790 --> 02:03:02.800
所有人员注意 有架飞机违规起飞
Anyone on the deck, we have a rogue bird.

1759
02:03:02.920 --> 02:03:04.210
把它打下来
We need to shut it down!

1760
02:03:04.340 --> 02:03:06.550
重复 起飞没获得批准
Repeat, takeoff is not authorised.

1761
02:03:37.080 --> 02:03:39.250
史塔克 听到了吗
Stark, do you hear me?

1762
02:03:39.370 --> 02:03:41.500
有架带核弹的战机飞过去了
You have a missile headed straight for the city.

1763
02:03:42.040 --> 02:03:43.420
还有多久
How long?

1764
02:03:43.540 --> 02:03:45.630
三分钟
Three minutes, max.

1765
02:03:45.750 --> 02:03:47.380
它会摧毁整个城区的
The payload will wipe out Midtown.

1766
02:03:47.510 --> 02:03:49.550
贾维斯 所有能源送进推进器
Jarvis, put everything we got into the thrusters.

1767
02:03:49.680 --> 02:03:51.340
已经完成
I just did.

1768
02:04:04.230 --> 02:04:05.570
核弹已发射
Package is sent.

1769
02:04:05.690 --> 02:04:08.820
2分30秒后引爆 完毕
Detonation in 2 minutes, 30 seconds, mark.

1770
02:04:31.590 --> 02:04:33.970
还能再打一轮吗
Are you ready for another bout?

1771
02:04:34.640 --> 02:04:35.680
怎么 你困了吗
What, are you getting sleepy?

1772
02:04:41.270 --> 02:04:43.020
对着它的顶端
Right at the crown!

1773
02:04:49.030 --> 02:04:50.820
我能关上它
I can close it.

1774
02:04:50.940 --> 02:04:52.990
有人听到吗
Can anybody copy?

1775
02:04:53.110 --> 02:04:54.240
我能关闭传送门
I can shut the portal down.

1776
02:04:54.360 --> 02:04:55.410
快关上
Do it!

1777
02:04:55.410 --> 02:04:56.410
不 等等
No, wait.

1778
02:04:56.530 --> 02:04:57.790
史塔克 敌人越来越多了
Stark, these things are still coming.

1779
02:04:57.910 --> 02:04:58.910
我这儿来了枚核弹
I got a nuke coming in.

1780
02:04:59.040 --> 02:05:00.950
一分钟内就会爆炸
It's gonna blow in less than a minute.

1781
02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:01.100
爆炸当量

1782
02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:01.100
杀伤半径

1783
02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:01.100
一

1784
02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:01.100


1785
02:05:10.630 --> 02:05:12.470
我知道该让它去哪儿了
And I knowjust where to put it.

1786
02:05:19.640 --> 02:05:22.020
史塔克 你可是有去无回
Stark, you know that's a one-way trip.

1787
02:05:22.140 --> 02:05:23.520
把能量都用来转弯 贾维斯
Save the rest for the turn, J.

1788
02:05:23.640 --> 02:05:27.730
先生 要联络珮珀小姐吗
Sir, shall I try Miss Potts?

1789
02:05:27.860 --> 02:05:29.100
联络吧
Might as well.

1790
02:05:31.820 --> 02:05:34.200
纽约市的街道变成了战场
The streets of New York City have become a battleground.

1791
02:05:33.700 --> 02:05:37.100
突发新闻

1792
02:05:33.700 --> 02:05:37.100
纽约市中心遭到袭击

1793
02:05:33.700 --> 02:05:37.100
纽约现场画面

1794
02:05:34.320 --> 02:05:37.030
军队也已经赶到了 正在试图控制局面
The Army is here trying to contain the violence

1795
02:05:37.160 --> 02:05:38.620
但是显然他们根本不是对手
but clearly, it is outmatched.

1796
02:05:38.740 --> 02:05:41.040
我不得不说 在我的职业生涯里
And I have to say, in all my years of reporting,

1797
02:05:41.160 --> 02:05:44.080
从来没有见过这种场面
I have never seen anything like this.

1798
02:05:44.210 --> 02:05:45.710
我们对这个应对小组还不是很熟悉
We have limited information on the team

1799
02:05:45.830 --> 02:05:49.590
但我们认出了钢铁侠 百万富翁托尼·史塔克
but we do know that billionaire Tony Stark's Iron Man...

1800
02:06:26.420 --> 02:06:27.600
呼叫 珮珀·波兹 失败

1801
02:07:02.910 --> 02:07:04.750
加油 史塔克
Come on, Stark.

1802
02:07:11.380 --> 02:07:12.500
关上它
Close it.

1803
02:07:32.560 --> 02:07:33.570
我的天呐
Son of a gun.

1804
02:07:38.320 --> 02:07:39.950
他没有减速
He's not slowing down.

1805
02:07:58.010 --> 02:07:59.470
还有呼吸吗
Is he breathing?

1806
02:08:27.330 --> 02:08:28.750
我的天
What the hell?

1807
02:08:31.460 --> 02:08:33.580
发生了什么
What just happened?

1808
02:08:33.710 --> 02:08:36.000
别告诉我有人亲了我一下
Please tell me nobody kissed me.

1809
02:08:40.300 --> 02:08:41.970
我们赢了
We won.

1810
02:08:44.300 --> 02:08:45.600
太好了
All right, yay!

1811
02:08:45.720 --> 02:08:47.680
嗨 干得漂亮 伙计们
Hurray. Good job, guys.

1812
02:08:47.810 --> 02:08:51.020
我看我们明天就别上班了 放一天假
Let's just not come in tomorrow. Let's just take a day.

1813
02:08:51.890 --> 02:08:53.480
吃过阿拉伯烤肉吗
Have you ever tried shawarma?

1814
02:08:53.900 --> 02:08:56.190
大概两条街外就有个馆子
There's a shawarma joint about two blocks from here.

1815
02:08:56.320 --> 02:08:57.980
不知道味道怎么样 但我想尝尝
I don't know what it is, but I want to try it.

1816
02:08:58.400 --> 02:08:59.860
我们还没完事呢
We're not finished yet.

1817
02:09:04.820 --> 02:09:06.950
那晚点再吃烤肉
And then shawarma after.

1818
02:09:28.600 --> 02:09:30.850
如果还可以的话
If it's all the same to you,

1819
02:09:34.140 --> 02:09:35.810
我想喝那杯酒
I'll have that drink now.

1820
02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:54.500

1821
02:09:53.200 --> 02:10:01.200

1825

谢谢你
复仇者联盟

1826
02:09:43.650 --> 02:09:47.280
尽管这起刚刚被确认为外星人入侵的事件 造成了巨大损失
Despite the devastation of what has been confirmed as an extraterrestrial attack,

1827
02:09:47.280 --> 02:09:51.330
但是这群被称为复仇者联盟的超级英雄们
the extraordinary heroics of the group known as the Avengers

1828
02:09:51.410 --> 02:09:53.450
对很多人来说 不仅是一种欣慰
has been to many a cause not only for comfort,

1829
02:09:53.450 --> 02:09:55.960
有他们 真的挺好
but for celebration. It's just really great knowing they're out there.

1830
02:09:56.790 --> 02:09:58.590
你知道 有人能够保护我们
That someone is watching over us.

1831
02:09:58.710 --> 02:09:59.920
我爱你 索尔
I love you, Thor!

1832
02:10:00.050 --> 02:10:03.220
然后那些家伙 噼噼 就都完蛋了
And then these guys were like... And then the air goes...

1833
02:10:03.340 --> 02:10:04.720
然后那个绿巨人
And this green guy walks up and he goes...

1834
02:10:04.840 --> 02:10:05.880
不知道
I don't know.

1835
02:10:06.010 --> 02:10:08.470
不知道在纽约是不是安全
I don't exactly feel safer with those things out there.

1836
02:10:08.600 --> 02:10:11.680
好像政府隐瞒了很多事
It just seems that there's a lot they're not telling us.

1837
02:10:11.810 --> 02:10:15.530
复仇者联盟:骗局？

1838
02:10:11.810 --> 02:10:15.230
超级英雄在纽约 那怎么可能呢
Superheroes in New York? Give me a break.

1839
02:10:16.230 --> 02:10:19.000
感谢你 复仇者

1840
02:10:12.230 --> 02:10:19.830
纽约参议员质疑复仇者

1841
02:10:19.830 --> 02:10:23.230
纽约参议员质疑复仇者

1842
02:10:15.350 --> 02:10:17.270
这些所谓的英雄
These so-called "heroes"

1843
02:10:17.400 --> 02:10:20.980
应该为这个城市所遭受的破坏负责
have to be held responsible for the destruction done to this city.

1844
02:10:21.110 --> 02:10:23.240
这是他们引起的 可他们人呢
This was their fight. Where are they now?

1845
02:10:23.360 --> 02:10:26.200
有关复仇者的问题多如潮水
Tough questions are being asked about the Avengers themselves.

1846
02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:28.820
但他们却好像人间蒸发了一样 不见了踪影
Their sudden appearance and equally sudden disappearance...

1847
02:10:28.950 --> 02:10:31.740
怎么 难道这都是他们的错
What, this is all somehow their fault?

1848

是美国队长救了我的命
Captain America saved my life.

1852
02:10:39.080 --> 02:10:42.590
无论他在哪儿 无论他们在哪儿
Wherever he is, and wherever any of them are,

1853
02:10:42.710 --> 02:10:44.210
我只想说
I would just...

1854
02:10:45.010 --> 02:10:47.300
想说谢谢你们
I would want to say thank you.

1855
02:10:49.760 --> 02:10:51.260
复仇者们在哪儿
Where are the Avengers?

1856
02:10:51.390 --> 02:10:53.810
现在我没有追踪他们的去向
I'm not currently tracking their whereabouts.

1857
02:10:53.930 --> 02:10:56.100
我觉得他们完全有理由休息一下
I'd say they've earned a leave of absence.

1858
02:10:56.230 --> 02:10:57.810
宇宙魔方呢
And the Tesseract?

1859
02:10:57.940 --> 02:11:00.190
它去了它该去的地方
The Tesseract is where it belongs.

1860
02:11:00.610 --> 02:11:02.940
离我们很远
Out of our reach.

1861
02:11:03.070 --> 02:11:04.610
你无权决定
That's not your call.

1862
02:11:04.740 --> 02:11:05.780
我没有决定
I didn't make it.

1863
02:11:05.900 --> 02:11:08.160
我只是遵从了神的旨意
I just didn't argue with the god that did.

1864
02:11:08.280 --> 02:11:10.070
你就这么让他们拿走了
So, you let him take it

1865
02:11:10.200 --> 02:11:11.830
还有战犯洛基
and the war criminal, Loki,

1866
02:11:11.950 --> 02:11:13.660
他需要为犯罪付出代价
who should be answering for his crime.

1867
02:11:13.790 --> 02:11:16.370
哦 我想他肯定会的
I think he will be.

1868
02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:32.510
我觉得你不明白你做了什么
I don't think you understand what you've started,

1869
02:11:32.640 --> 02:11:35.100
你成立了复仇者联盟
letting the Avengers loose on this world.

1870
02:11:35.640 --> 02:11:36.640
他们很危险
They're dangerous.

1871
02:11:36.770 --> 02:11:40.440
他们是很危险 全世界都知道
They surely are, and the whole world knows it.

1872
02:11:40.980 --> 02:11:43.570
甚至是整个宇宙都知道了
Every world knows it.

1873
02:11:43.980 --> 02:11:46.070
这不正是我们的初衷吗
Was that the point of all this?

1874
02:11:46.190 --> 02:11:47.950
展现实力
A statement?

1875
02:11:50.660 --> 02:11:52.120
是自保的承诺
A promise.

1876
02:12:00.830 --> 02:12:02.380
现在该怎么办 长官
Sir, how does it work now?

1877
02:12:03.500 --> 02:12:05.500
他们都各奔东西了
They've gone their separate ways.

1878
02:12:05.630 --> 02:12:08.550
有些人 走得相当远
Some, pretty extremely far.

1879
02:12:09.300 --> 02:12:11.220
如果我们又遇到这种情况
If we get into a situation like this again,

1880
02:12:11.340 --> 02:12:12.890
该怎么对付
what happens then?

1881
02:12:13.010 --> 02:12:14.010
他们会回来的
They'll come back.

1882
02:12:15.510 --> 02:12:17.220
您真这么想吗
Are you really sure about that?

1883
02:12:17.350 --> 02:12:18.350
当然
I am.

1884
02:12:19.980 --> 02:12:21.190

Why?

1885

1978
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.880
情况有多糟
How bad is it?

1979
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.290
最糟的是 长官 不知道情况
That's the problem, sir. We don't know.

1980
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.790
四小时前席尔维格博士 检测到魔方发出了一股能量
Dr Selvig read an energy surge from the Tesseract four hours ago.

1981
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.800
航天局没授权博士进行测试
NASA didn't authorise Selvig to go to test phase.

1982
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.170
他没进行测试 他根本就不在房间
He wasn't testing it. He wasn't even in the room.

1983
00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.380
是自动触发的
Spontaneous event.

1984
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:19.680
它就这么自己激活了
It just turned itself on?

1985
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:20.930
能量现在什么水平
Where are the energy levels now?

1986
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.310
上升中 确定博士无法关闭之后 我们下令撤离了
Climbing. When Selvig couldn't shut it down, we ordered evac.

1987
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.720
全部撤出要多长时间
How long to get everyone out?

1988
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.270
半个小时就可以清场了
Campus should be clear in the next half-hour.

1989
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.730
抓紧点
Do better.

1990
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.650
长官 撤离也许是没用的
Sir, evacuation may be futile.

1991
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.230
难道让他们回去睡大觉
We should tell them to go back to sleep?

1992
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.650
如果我们不能控制宇宙魔方的能量
If we can't control the Tesseract's energy,

1993
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.190
我认为躲到任何地方都是没用的
there may not be a minimum safe distance.

1994
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.360
我要你确保
I need you to make sure

1995
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.160
第2阶段原型机能安全转移
the Phase 2 prototypes are shipped out.

1996
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.370
长官 现在不是优先考虑这些的时候吧
Sir, is that really a priority right now?

1997
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.790

除非世界末日到了
Until such time as the world ends,

2000
00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.450
否则我们的日子还得继续过
we will act as though it intends to spin on.

2001
00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:48.790
马上清点物品
Clear out the tech below.

2002
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.500
把所有相关设备都装车运走
Every piece of Phase 2 on a truck and gone.

2003
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:52.790
是 长官
Yes, sir.

2004
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.380
跟我来
With me.

2005
00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.470
怎么回事  博士
Talk to me, Doctor.

2006
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.470

长官
Director.

2009
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.510
告诉我现在是什么情况
Is there anything we know for certain?

2010
00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.970
宇宙魔方不太正经
The Tesseract is misbehaving.

2011
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.580
是开玩笑的时候吗
Is that supposed to be funny?

2012
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:08.980
不是开玩笑
No, it's not funny at all.

2013
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.690
宇宙魔方不仅活跃 而且 我行我素
The Tesseract is not only active, she's behaving.

2014
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:13.900
你没拔了插头试试
I assume you pulled the plug.

2015
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.820
它本身就是个能量源
She's an energy source.

2016
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.070
我们关闭电源 它自己又打开了
We turn off the power, she turns it back on.

2017
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.360
如果让它达到峰值
If she reaches peak level...

2018
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.990
那不正是我们的目的吗 从宇宙中汲取能量
We prepa red for this, Doctor. Harnessing energy from space.

2019
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.580
我们还没有做好准备
But we don't have the harness.

2020
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.990
我的计算还需要一段时间
My calculations are far from complete.

2021
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.080
它在不停地发射干扰和放射物
And she's throwing off interference, radiation.

2022
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.000
倒没有什么害处 是非常低的伽马射线
Nothing harmful, low levels of gamma radiation.

2023
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.750
还是会有害处的
That can be harmful.

2024
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.380
巴顿特工呢
Where's Agent Barton?

2025
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.260
鹰小子
The Hawk?

2026
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.180
在鸟窝里躲着呢
Up in his nest, as usual.

2027
00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.180

Agent Barton, report.

2030
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.470
我给你的任务
I gave you this detail

2031
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.180
是仔细观察瞭望 巴顿
so you could keep a close eye on things.

2032
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.770
只有站得高才能看得远
Well, I see better from a distance.

2033
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.940
看到是什么东西激活了它吗
Have you seen anything that might set this thing off?

2034
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:53.720
博士 又一次脉冲
Doctor, it's spiking again.

2035
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.410
警报

2036
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.410
飞马座项目第5阶段

2037
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.110
没有人进出过
No one's come or gone.

2038
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.940
席尔维格博士是清白的
And Selvig's clean.

2039
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.440
没任何接触 也没信息
No contacts, no IMs.

2040
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.740
有问题的话 也不会出在我们这边
If there was any tampering, sir, it wasn't at this end.

2041
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.030
我们这边
"At this end"?

2042
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.080
是啊 魔方是通向宇宙另一边的一扇门 对吧
Yeah, the Cube is a doorway to the other end of space, right?

2043
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.210
这门应该两边都能开
Doors open from both sides.

2044
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.290
没到时候
Not yet.

2045
00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.290

2048
00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:06.820
你与众不同
You have heart.

2049
00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:38.890
把箱子放下
Please don't.

2050
00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:41.900
我真的需要它
I still need that.

2051
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.570
没必要弄得这么紧张吧
This doesn't have to get any messier.

2052
00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:44.980
当然有必要
Of course it does.

2053
00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.070
我大老远来就是为了这个
I've come too far for anything else.

2054
00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:51.820
我是洛基 来自神域
I am Loki, of Asgard

2055
00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.910
我肩负着你们无法理解的伟大使命

洛基
Loki,

2057
00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.330
你是索尔的兄弟
brother of Thor.

2058
00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.000
我们和你们无冤无仇
We have no quarrel with your people.

2059
00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.170
蚂蚁 和你的鞋也无冤无仇
An ant has no quarrel with a boot.

2060
00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.420
这么说你想踩死我们
Are you planning to step on us?

2061
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.840
我其实带来的是一个好消息
I come with glad tidings

2062
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.010
一个没有牵挂的世界
of a world made free.

2063
00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:14.390
牵挂什么
Free from what?

2064
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.930
自由
Freedom.

2065
00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:19.100
自由是生命中最大的谎言
Freedom is life's great lie.

2066
00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:22.730
如果接受了这一点 你的内心
Once you accept that, in your heart,

2067
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:29.110
就能得到和平
you will know peace.

2068
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.860
你所谓的和平
Yeah, you say "peace,"

2069
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:33.910
倒是让我想到了它的反义词
I kind of think you mean the other thing.

2070
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.620
头儿 弗瑞指挥官在拖延时间
Sir, Director Fury is stalling.

2071
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:38.160
这地方马上就要爆炸了
This place is about to blow

2072
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.540
我们会被埋在石堆下面
and drop a hundred feet of rock on us.

2073
00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:42.540
几百米的石堆
He means to bury us.

2074
00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:43.880
就像埃及金字塔一样
Like the pharaohs of old.

2075
00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.040
他说得对 输送门开始崩溃了
He's right. The portal is collapsing in on itself.

2076
00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:48.460
距离完全颠覆 还有两分钟时间
We've got maybe two minutes before this goes critical.

2077
00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:49.840
好吧
Well, then.

2078
00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:06.690
我需要用这些车
I need these vehicles.

2079
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:11.910
那个人是谁
Who's that?

2080
00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:12.910
他没让我告诉你
They didn't tell me.

2081
00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.370
希尔

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:21.120
巴顿叛变了
Barton has turned.

2084
00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:37.010
他们拿走了魔方 快拦住他们
They have the Tesseract! Shut them down!

2085
00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:15.630
快点 快走 快点 快走 走
Okay, let's go. No, leave it. Go!

2086
00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:34.240
楼上完事了 长官 你快走吧
We're clear upstairs, sir. You need to go.

2087
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.540
长官
Director?

2088
00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:09.370
弗瑞长官 听到了吗
Director Fury, do you copy?

2089
00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:11.880
魔方被不明敌人拿走了
The Tesseract is with a hostile force.

2090
00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:14.550
我的人员有伤亡 希尔
I have men down. Hill?

2091
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.760
很多人还被压在下面
A lot of men still under.

2092
00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.670
不知道有多少人能生还
I don't know how many survivors.

2093
00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.050
发出紧急命令
Sound a general call.

2094
00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.970
集合所有没有参与救援的人
I want every living soul not working rescue

2095
00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:23.100
马上去给我找回箱子
looking for that briefcase.

2096
00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:24.350
知道了
Roger that.

2097
00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.850
科尔森 你回基地 发出七级警报
Coulson, get back to base. This is a Level Seven.

2098
00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:30.520
从目前情况看
As of right now,

2099
00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:32.190
战争 已经开始了
we are at war.

2100
00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:35.190
我们怎么办
What do we do?

2101
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:44.800
复仇者联盟

2102
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:44.800

俄罗斯 某地
Russia Somewhere

2111
00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:15.770
你的表现和我今晚期待不太一样
This is not how I wanted this evening to go.

2112
00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:17.520
我知道你今晚的期待是什么
I know how you wanted this evening to go.

2113
00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:18.820
相信我
Believe me

这样更好
this is better.

2115
00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:22.820

2116
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.780
勒曼托夫 对不对
Lermentov, yes?

2117
00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.200
他是不是觉得
Does he think

2118
00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:30.620
我们需要经过他的允许
we have to go through him

2119
00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:32.370
才能运我们的那批货
to move our cargo?

2120
00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:38.170
我还以为是索罗霍布将军 负责出口的生意
I thought General Solohob is in charge of the export business.

2121
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.460
索罗霍布
Solohob

2122
00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:42.720
他不过是个幌子
a bagman, a front.

2123
00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:49.350
你那过时的情报害了你
Your outdated information betrays you.

2124
00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:53.690
大名鼎鼎的黑寡妇
The famous Black Widow

2125
00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:59.730
也不过就是个漂亮的花瓶而已
and she turns out to be simply another pretty face.

2126
00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:03.780
你真的觉得我漂亮吗
You really think I'm pretty?

2127
00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.580
告诉勒曼托夫我们不需要他
Tell Lermentov we don't need him

2128

我们自己就能搞定

他现在已经出局了
Tell him he is out.

2130
00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:18.090

Well...

2131

We have an F-22 exactly eight miles out.

让那个女人听电话
Put the woman on the phone,

2138
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:48.070
不然我把整条街都炸飞
or I will blow up the block before you can make the lobby.

2139
00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:55.570
快回总部来

Are you kidding? I'm working.

2143
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:58.170
这边情况更紧急
This takes precedence.

2144
00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.000
我这边正在审问呢
I'm in the middle of an interrogation.

2145
00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:01.960
这个老笨蛋 什么都招了
This moron is giving me everything.

2146
00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:05.010
我没说 什么也没说
I don't give everything.

2147
00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:07.800
听着 我不能说走就走
Look, you can't pull me out of this right now.

巴顿被敌人控制了
Barton's been compromised.

2150

Let me put you on hold.

2151
00:14:58.810 --> 00:14:59.810
巴顿现在在哪儿
Where is Barton now?

2152
00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:01.480

2158
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:06.780
现在我们需要你找那家伙谈谈
But first, we need you to talk to the big guy.

2159
00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:10.070
科尔森 你明明知道 史塔克他根本就不相信我
Coulson, you know that Stark trusts me about as far as he can throw me.

2160
00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:13.780
不 我来搞定史塔克 你去找大块头
I've got Stark. You get the big guy.

2161
00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:18.040

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:41.060
快出去
Get out!

2165
00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:43.690
这里有病菌
There is sickness here!

2166

2170
00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:49.780
他发烧了还一直叫
He has a fever and he's moaning

2171
00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:50.990
他连眼睛都睁不开
but his eyes won't open.

2172
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:52.110
慢慢说
Slow down.

2173
00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:54.740
我爸爸
My father...

2174
00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:58.120
像他们一样
Like them?

2175
00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:03.380
求求你
Please.

2176
00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:32.860
我应该先收她的钱
You should've got paid up front, Banner.

2177
00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:35.780
对于一个需要躲避压力的人来说
You know, for a man who's supposed to be avoiding stress

2178
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:39.240
你倒是挑了一个好地方
you picked a hell of a place to settle.

2179
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.210
一味地逃避避也不是万能的
Avoiding stress isn't the secret.

2180
00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.920
那什么才行 瑜珈
Then what is it? Yoga?

2181
00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:50.260
你把我引到偏僻的郊区来 很聪明
You brought me to the edge of the city. Smart.

2182
00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:54.890
我估计这个地方已经被包围了吧
I assume the whole place is surrounded.

2183
00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:56.720
只有你和我
Just you and me.

2184
00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:00.020
那那个小女孩呢
And your actress buddy?

2185
00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:02.180
也是特工吗 入行够早的
Is she a spy, too? They start that young?

2186
00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:03.850
我也是
I did.

2187
00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:05.100
你是谁
Who are you?

2188
00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:06.440
娜塔莎·罗曼诺夫
Natasha Romanoff.

2189
00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:11.110
你是来杀我的吗
Are you here to kill me, Ms Romanoff?

2190
00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:14.030
老实说恐怕能杀我的人 还没生呢
Because that's not going to work out for everyone.

2191
00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.700
不不 当然不是 我是代表神盾局来找你的
No, of course not. I'm here on behalf of S.H.I.E.L.D.

2192
00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:19.950
神盾局
S.H.I.E.L.D.

2193
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:22.750
怎么发现我的
How did they find me?

2194
00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:24.540
我们一直在关注你 博士
We never lost you, Doctor.

2195
00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:25.750
但是保持着距离
We've kept our distance.

2196
00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.750
甚至暗地里把一些对你感兴趣的人
Even helped keep some other interested parties

2197
00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:28.960
挡了下来
off your scent.

2198
00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:30.460
为什么
Why?

2199
00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:32.970
尼克·弗瑞好像很信任你
Nick Fury seems to trust you.

2200
00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:34.800
不过你得和我走一趟
But now we need you to come in.

2201
00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:37.640
如果我拒绝呢
What if I say no?

2202
00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:39.970
我会说服你的
I'll persuade you.

2203
00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:46.440
如果我身体里的  另一个我拒绝呢
And what if the other guy says no?

2204
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:48.770
你一年多都没出现变化了
You've been more than a year without an incident.

2205
00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:51.570
这会儿我希望你能保持下去
I don't think you want to break that streak.

2206
00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:56.410
不见得我每次都能HOLD住
Well, I don't every time get what I want.

2207
00:17:57.450 --> 00:17:59.660
博士 我们现在面临一场全球性的灾难
Doctor, we're facing a potential global catastrophe.

2208
00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:03.620
我倒是一直都想远离灾难呢
Well, those I actively try to avoid.

2209
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:06.000
这个
This

2210
00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:08.580
叫做宇宙魔方
is the Tesseract.

2211
00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:11.590
这东西有着摧毁地球的能量
It has the potential energy to wipe out the planet.

2212
00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:16.590
弗瑞想要我干什么 吃了它
What does Fury want me to do, swallow it?

2213
00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.260
他希望你能找到它 魔方被抢了
He wants you to find it. It's been taken.

2214
00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:24.270
目前它散发的伽马射线太微弱 我们追踪不到
It emits a gamma signature that's too weak for us to trace.

2215
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:27.390
没人比你更了解伽马射线
There's no one that knows gamma radiation like you do.

2216
00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:30.400
所以 弗瑞派我来找你谈谈
If there was, that's where I'd be.

2217
00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:33.150
这么说你们不是来抓怪物的
So, Fury isn't after the monster?

2218
00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:34.610
至少他没这么说
Not that he's told me.

2219
00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:36.990
他什么都跟你说吗
And he tells you everything?

2220
00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:39.030
你直接问他 他现在需要你
Talk to Fury. He needs you on this.

2221
00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.200
需要把我关在笼子里
He needs me in a cage?

2222
00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.330
没人会把你
No one's going to put you in a...

2223
00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:42.490
别再骗我了
Stop lying to me!

2224
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:49.330
很抱歉 我失态了
I'm sorry. That was mean.

2225
00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:52.460
我只是想看看你的反应
I just wanted to see what you'd do.

2226
00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:56.630
我们最好还是都冷静点
Why don't we do this the easy way

2227
00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:58.090
你把那个东西收起来
where you don't use that

2228
00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:02.220
然后 另一个我 也不会出来捣乱
and the other guy doesn't make a mess.

2229
00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:04.310
好吗
Okay?

2230
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:06.640
娜塔莎
Natasha?

2231
00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:13.360
别过来
Stand down.

2232
00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.860
一切正常
We're good here.

2233
00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:19.240
只有你和我
"Just you and me."

2234
00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:23.990
你这是在玩火 指挥官
This is out of line, Director.

2235
00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.620
这不是你所能控制的力量
You're dealing with forces you can't control.

2236
00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:30.500
打过仗吗 议员阁下 真正的战争
You ever been in a war, Councilman? In a firefight?

2237
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:33.500
在战斗的时候你喜欢被人控制吗
Did you feel an overabundance of control?

2238
00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:37.090
你是说 神域向我们地球宣战了
You're saying that this Asgard is declaring war on our planet?

2239
00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:39.840
我不是说神域 是洛基
Not Asgard. Loki.

2240
00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:42.850
他不会是一个人 那家伙呢
He can't be working alone. What about the other one?

2241
00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:44.010
他的兄弟
His brother.

2242
00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:46.180
我们的情报显示 索尔没有恶意
Our intelligence says Thor is not a hostile

2243
00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:47.390
但他远在天边
but he's worlds away.

2244
00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.350
指望不上他来帮我们
We can't depend on him to help, either.

2245
00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.480
只能靠我们自己
It's up to us.

2246
00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:53.230
你更应该把精力 放在第2阶段的工作上
Which is why you should be focusing on Phase 2.

2247
00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.690
第2阶段就是为了应付这种
It was designed for exactly this...

2248
00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:58.070
第2阶段还不成熟 敌人却不同
Phase 2 isn't ready. Our enemy is.

2249
00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.860
我们需要一个应对小组
We need a response team.

2250
00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:02.360
复仇者方案已经被终止了
The Avengers Initiative was shut down.

2251
00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:04.370
我没强调是复仇者
This isn't about the Avengers.

2252
00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:05.700
我们看过名单
We've seen the list.

2253
00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:08.120
你掌控着全球最精锐的秘密特工组织
You're running the world's greatest covert security network

2254
00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:09.870
你打算把人类的存亡
and you're going to leave the fate of the human race

2255
00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.290
交到一帮怪胎的手上吗
to a handful of freaks.

2256
00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:13.330
我没打算把什么交给谁
I'm not leaving anything to anyone.

2257
00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:15.750
我说需要一个应对小组
We need a response team.

2258
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.710
他们可能会各自为阵 甚至可能失控
These people may be isolated, unbalanced even

2259
00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:23.090
但我相信只要使用得当 他们现在正是我们需要的人
but I believe with the right push they can be exactly what we need.

2260
00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:24.680
你凭什么相信
You believe?

2261
00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:28.470
打仗不能靠意气用事 指挥官
War isn't won by sentiment, Director.

2262
00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:32.520
没错 打仗靠的是士兵
No, it's won by soldiers.

2263
00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:53.960
时间不够用
There's not enough time.

2264
00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:55.710
看来得海上迫降了
I got to put her in the water!

2265
00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:02.130
你不会孤单的
You won't be alone.

2266
00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.220
哦 天呐
Oh, my God.

2267
00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:05.840
这个人还活着
This guy is still alive!

2268
00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.840
一

睡不着了
Trouble sleeping?

2271
00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:36.380
一觉睡了70年 长官 我觉得睡够了
I slept for 70 years, sir. I think I've had my fill.

2272
00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:41.840
那你应该出去转一转 看看风景
Then you should be out, celebrating, seeing the world.

2273
00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:50.510
我昏过去的时候 这个世界在打仗

Who took it from you?

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:32.590
先生 恐怕 他不会相信的

问你一个问题
Which brings me to my next question.

当天才的感觉怎么样 说实话
How does it feel to be a genius?

哦 我想我永远不会知道
Well, I really wouldn't know, now would I?

2338
00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:56.120
什么意思 要知道这都是 源自于你
What do you mean? All this came from you.

2339
00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:59.950
不 应该是 源于这里
No, all this came from that.

2340
00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.460
你就别谦虚了 老实说
Give yourself some credit. Please.

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:09.880
最多加到15%
An argument can be made for 15.

2345
00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:11.590
孩子只有我12%
12%? My baby?

2346
00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:13.380
至少我干的可都是力气活
Well, I did do all the heavy lifting.

2347
00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:15.390
确切地说 我出的汗比你多
Literally, I lifted the heavy things.

2348
00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.890
哦 还有 安保的那些漏洞怎么说
And, sorry, but the security snafu?

2349
00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:19.470
得算你的吧
That was on you.

2350
00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:20.730
我的私人电梯
My private elevator...

2351
00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:21.730
应该是我们的电梯
You mean our elevator?

2352
00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:24.600
对 里面挤满了一身臭汗的工人
...it was teeming with sweaty workmen.

2353
00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:27.150
我会补偿刚才关于百分比的言论
I'm going to pay for that comment about percentages

2354
00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:29.320
温柔地补偿怎么样
in some subtle way later, aren't I?

2355
00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:30.980
恐怕不会太温柔
It's not going to be that subtle.

2356
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:32.490
我现在宣布
I'll tell you what.

2357
00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:35.160
我把你的名字写在下一个大厦上
The next building is gonna say "Potts" on the tower.

2358

On the lease.

2359

我马上就走
I can't stay.

2372
00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:02.180
我还以为他就叫特工呢
His first name is "Agent".

2373
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:04.020
进来吧 我们正在庆祝呢
Come on in. We're celebrating.

2374
00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:06.020
那他就更得走了
Which is why he can't stay.

2375
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:08.190
请尽快看一下这个 非常紧急
We need you to look this over as soon as possible.

2382
00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:21.240
这可不是咨询
This isn't a consultation.

2383
00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:22.620
和复仇者有关
Is this about the Avengers?

2384
00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:24.870
我可什么都不知道
Which I know nothing about.

2385
00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.620
我以为复仇者方案已经作废了呢
The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought.

2386
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:29.210
而且我也不够入会的标准
And I didn't even qualify.

2387
00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:30.420
这我也不知道
I didn't know that either.

2388
00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:33.460
因为我这个人反复无常 极度自我
Apparently I'm volatile, self-obsessed,

2389
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:34.840
而且还很不合群
don't play well with others.

2390
00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:36.130
这我倒知道
That I did know.

2391
00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:37.890
现在和个性已经没有关系了
This isn't about personality profiles any more.

2392
00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:40.390
无所谓 波兹小姐 过来一下
Whatever. Ms Potts, got a second?

2393
00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:41.600
等一会儿
Half a mo.

2394
00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:49.230
你看 我以为 能过二人世界呢
You know, I thought we were having a moment.

2395
00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:51.020
我们过了12%的了
I was having 12% of a moment.

2396
00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:54.690
看起来很严重 菲尔显得很紧张
This seems serious. Phil's pretty shaken.

2397
00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:56.860
你怎么知道很 你怎么叫他菲尔
How would you know if it's... Why is he "Phil"?

2398
00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:58.820
这些是什么
What is all this?

2399
00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:00.570

2405
00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:18.510
- 你要是不做  - 是啊
- If you didn't? - Yeah.

2406
00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.890
你是说等你忙完了
You mean when you've finished?

2407
00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:25.270
好吧 嗯 再说
Well, then...

我可以捎你
I can drop you.

2412
00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:44.700

Fantastic.

嗯 说说那个拉大提琴的
I want to hear about the cellist.

2414
00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:47.620

搬回波特兰去了
She moved back to Portland.

2416

We're about 40 minutes out from home base, sir.

这么说班纳博士 打算复制他们在我身上用过的血清吗
So, this Dr Banner was trying to replicate the serum they used on me?

2422
00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:11.900
很多人这么想
A lot of people were.

2423
00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:13.730
你是历史上第一个超级英雄
You were the world's first superhero.

2424
00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:17.150
班纳认为伽马射线 会是解开艾斯凯恩博士
Banner thought gamma radiation might hold the key to unlocking

2425
00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:18.650
原始配方的关键
Erskine's original formula.

2426
00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:21.070
但是他并没有如愿
Didn't really go his way, did it?

2427
00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:22.950
可以这么说
Not so much.

2428
00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.990
他不变身的时候 和史蒂芬·霍金差不多
When he's not that thing, though, the guy's like a Stephen Hawking.

2429
00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.580
他是个绝顶的天才
He's like a smart person.

2430
00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:33.830
说实话
I gotta say,

2431
00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:36.590
见到你是我的荣幸 是真的
it's an honour to meet you officially.

2432
00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:40.800
其实我见过你 是在你昏睡的时候
I've sort of met you. I mean, I watched you while you were sleeping.

2433
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:48.350
当时你从冰里 被弄出来的时候 我正好在场
I mean, I was present while you were unconscious from the ice.

2434
00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:52.940
没想到 这次你能加入我们 我  真的是太荣幸了
You know, it's really just a huge honour to have you on board this...

2435
00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:55.190
但愿我不会让你们失望
I hope I'm the man for the job.

2436
00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:58.280
你行 你肯定行
Oh, you are. Absolutely.

2437
00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:01.360
嗯 我们改良了一下你的制服 在不影响活动的基础上
We made some modifications to the uniform.

2438
00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:03.070
加了一点  新的元素
I had a little design input.

2439
00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:04.530
我的制服
The uniform?

2440
00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:07.240
那些星星和条纹是不是
Aren't the stars and stripes a little

2441
00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:09.750
显得老套
old-fashioned?

2442
00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:12.750
在目前的局势下
With everything that's happening

2443
00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.580
考虑到即将发生的事
and the things that are about to come to light,

2444
00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:18.920
我觉得大家可能 需要一些老办法
people might just need a little old-fashioned.

2445
00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:25.920
德国 某地
Germany Somewhere

2446
00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:54.410
齐塔瑞人开始不安稳了
The Chitauri grow restless.

2447
00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:56.330
让他们做好准备
Let them gird themselves.

2448
00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:58.250
我会带他们打一场光荣的战争
I will lead them in the glorious battle.

2449
00:29:58.460 --> 00:29:59.630
战争
Battle?

2450
00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:03.550
对那些弱小的地球人
Against the meagre might of Earth?

2451
00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:06.590
光荣 但不会漫长
Glorious, not lengthy.

2452
00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:10.600
只要你的军队真的有你说的那么强大
If your force is as formidable as you claim.

2453
00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:13.310
你在质疑我们吗
You question us?

2454
00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:15.640
质疑这个
You question him,

2455
00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:18.270
把权杖交到你手上的人
he who put the sceptre in your hand?

2456
00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:21.400
他赋予你远古的知识以及新的理想
Who gave you ancient knowledge and new purpose

2457
00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:24.490
当时你可是被打败了
when you were cast out, defeated?

2458
00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:26.570
我才是一国之君
I was a king!

2459
00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:28.990
是神域的绝对君主
The rightful king of Asgard,

2460
00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:30.490
我遭到背叛
betrayed.

2461
00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:33.790
你的那点志向微不足道
Your ambition is little

2462
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.750
充满孩子气
and born of childish need.

2463
00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.960
我们的目光不止是地球
We look beyond the Earth

2464
00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:42.130
而是宇宙魔方将要展现的更广阔的世界
to the greater worlds the Tesseract will unveil.

2465
00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:44.010
你还没得到宇宙魔方
You don't have the Tesseract yet.

2466
00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:47.800
我不是威胁你
I don't threaten.

2467
00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:51.930
在我打开那些门之前
But until I open the doors,

2468
00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:55.770
在我统领你的军队之前你的承诺
until your force is mine to command,

2469
00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:58.310
都是空话
you are but words.

2470
00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:02.480
去打你的仗吧 神域人
You will have your war, Asgardian.

2471
00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:06.280
等你失败了
If you fail,

2472
00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:11.660
宇宙魔方没有到我们的手里
if the Tesseract is kept from us,

2473
00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:16.250
那你就别指望你的王国了 也没有供你栖身的角落
there will be no realm, no barren moon,

2474
00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:19.750
无论你躲到哪儿他都能找到你
no crevice where he cannot find you.

2475
00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:24.090
他会让你哀嚎
You think you know pain?

2476
00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:29.970
让你知道 什么才是真正的痛不欲生
He will make you long for something sweet as pain.

2477
00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:00.210
把队长的装备收好
Stow the captain's gear.

2478
00:32:00.330 --> 00:32:01.330
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

2479
00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:06.000
罗曼诺夫特工 罗杰斯上尉
Agent Romanoff, Captain Rogers.

2480
00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:07.510
- 你好 - 你好
- Ma'am. - Hi.

2481
00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:08.670
你得去舰桥
They need you on the bridge.

2482
00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:10.300
他们开始定位追踪了
They're starting the face-trace.

2483
00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:11.590
一会儿见
See you there.

2484
00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:17.470
你在这儿可算是个风云人物了
It was quite the buzz around here, finding you in the ice.

2485
00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:20.350
我以为科尔森见到你会晕过去
I thought Coulson was gonna swoon.

2486
00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:23.440
他是不是让你在他的珍藏品上签名
Did he ask you to sign his Captain America trading cards yet?

2487
00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:24.860
珍藏品
Trading cards?

2488
00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:27.230
那可是他引以为豪的宝贝
They're vintage. He's very proud.

2489
00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:30.280
班纳博士
Dr Banner.

2490
00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:33.570
哦 天呐 你好
Yeah, hi.

2491
00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:35.330
他们说了你会来
They told me you would be coming.

2492
00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:36.830
听说你能找到魔方
Word is, you can find the Cube.

2493
00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:39.750
你 就只听这么多吗
Is that the only word on me?

2494
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.330
我只关心这么多
Only word I care about.

2495
00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:46.500
你会觉得这一切 都很新奇
It must be strange for you, all of this.

2496
00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:49.880
哦 其实倒是觉得似曾相识
Well, this is actually kind of familiar.

2497
00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:52.680
先生们 你们最好还是赶快进去
Gentlemen, you might want to step inside in a minute.

2498
00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:55.640
外面一会儿就会无法呼吸了
It's going to get a little hard to breathe.

2499
00:32:56.890 --> 00:32:58.430
飞行机组 清理甲板
Flight crew, secure the deck.

2500
00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:04.520
这是艘潜艇吗
Is this a submarine?

2501
00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:06.060
看来
Really?

2502
00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:09.940
他们想把我关在一个深藏在水底 不透气的铁罐子里
They want me in a submerged, pressurised, metal container?

2503
00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:38.720
不 不 情况好像更糟
No, no, this is much worse.

2504
00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:45.720
一

2505
00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:45.720
名称：天空母舰（Helicarrier）
资料：神盾局拥有的具备海中航行及空中飞行功能

2506
00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:11.700
检查完毕 准备启航 一切就绪

2508
00:34:18.970 --> 00:34:20.650
功率输出最大值

2509
00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:21.890
准备上升

注意 动力已经全部开启
Power plant performing at capacity.

2511
00:34:25.390 --> 00:34:26.850
一切就绪
We are clear.

2512
00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:28.560
所有引擎运转正常
All engines operating.

2513
00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:33.400
神盾局紧急程序193.6已启动
S.H.I.E.L.D. Emergency Protocol 193.6 in effect.

2514
00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:35.200
到达预定标度 长官
We are at level, sir.

2515
00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:36.200
很好
Good.

2516
00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:37.570
人间蒸发吧
Let's vanish.

2517
00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:40.200
启动背景反射面板
Engage retro-reflection panels.

2518
00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:57.130
背景反射面板已启动
Reflection panels engaged.

2519
00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:59.140
先生们
Gentlemen.

2520
00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:12.610
感谢你能来 博士
Doctor, thank you for coming.

2521
00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:16.490
谢谢你的盛情邀请
Thanks for asking nicely.

2522
00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:19.320
那么 打算让我待多久
So, how long am I staying?

2523
00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:21.330
等我们找到了宇宙魔方
Once we get our hands on the Tesseract,

2524
00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:22.660
你就可以随便了
you're in the wind.

2525
00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:24.620
目前有什么进展吗
Where are you with that?

2526
00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:26.580
我们监视着地球上
We're sweeping every wirelessly accessible

2527
00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:27.710
每一个无线接入的摄像头
camera on the planet.

2528
00:35:28.290 --> 00:35:30.080
手机 笔记本
Cell phones, laptops ...

2529
00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:32.350
搜索

2530
00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:33.920
只要是联着网的 都会是我们的目标
If it's connected to a satellite, it's eyes and ears for us.

2531
00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:35.380
还不能及时找到他们
That's still not gonna find them in time.

2532
00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:36.590
应该缩小寻找范围
You have to narrow your field.

2533
00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.760
你能找到多少光谱仪
How many spectrometers do you have access to?

2534
00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:40.590
- 你想要多少 - 给所有实验室打电话
- How many are there? - Call every lab you know.

2535
00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.510
把光谱仪都架到屋顶上去
Tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof

2536
00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:44.100
然后都校准到伽马射线上
and calibrate them for gamma rays.

2537
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:47.520
我会设定一个追踪算法 然后对源头进行辨认
I'll rough out a tracking algorithm, basic cluster recognition.

2538
00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:50.230
这样我们至少能滤掉一些目标
At least we could rule out a few places.

2539
00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:52.270
给我找个干活的地方
Do you have somewhere for me to work?

2540
00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:53.650
罗曼诺夫
Agent Romanoff,

2541
00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:56.070
带班纳博士去他的实验室好吗
could you show Dr Banner to his laboratory, please?

2542
00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:59.450
你会喜欢的 博士 那儿应有尽有
You're gonna love it, Doc. We got all the toys.

2543
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:01.780
把它放那儿
Put it over there.

2544
00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:05.910
你从哪儿找来这些人
Where did you find all these people?

2545
00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:09.080
神盾局树敌不少啊 博士
S.H.I.E.L.D. has no shortage of enemies, Doctor.

2546
00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:10.620
这是你要的东西
Is this the stuff you need?

2547
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:11.790
没错 是铱
Yeah, iridium.

2548
00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:12.790
铱元素

2549
00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:12.790
海因里希·谢弗博士

2550
00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:14.590
它随着陨石而来 可以形成反质子
It's found in meteorites. It forms anti-protons.

2551
00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.420
这东西现在很抢手
It's very hard to get hold of.

2552
00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:18.170
神盾局知道了就更抢手了
Especially if S.H.I.E.L.D. knows you need it.

2553
00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:19.760
啊 我不知道
Well, I didn't know.

2554
00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:21.180
嗨
Hey!

2555
00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:23.680
宇宙魔方让我大开眼界
The Tesseract has shown me so much.

2556
00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:26.060
这可不仅仅是知识 而是真理
It's more than knowledge. It's truth.

2557
00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:27.180
我知道
I know.

2558
00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:29.940
它让你看到了什么 巴顿
What did it show you, Agent Barton?

2559
00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:32.310
我的下一个目标
My next target.

2560
00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:33.480
告诉我你需要什么
Tell me what you need.

2561
00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:38.820
我需要一个诱饵
I need a distraction.

2562
00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:41.160
和眼线
And an eyeball.

2563
00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:47.660
不符合

2564
00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:50.460
我是说 如果不太麻烦
I mean, if it's not too much trouble.

2565
00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:51.710
不不 没问题
No, no. It's fine.

2566
00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:56.340
这是典藏版
It's a vintage set.

2567
00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:58.840
我花了好几年才凑齐它们
It took me a couple of years to collect them all.

2568
00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:02.470
很新的
Near mint.

2569
00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:04.050
边角稍有些磨损 不过
Slight foxing around the edges, but...

2570
00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:06.890
发现线索 吻合度67%
We got a hit. A 67% match.

2571
00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:09.020
等等 79%
Wait. Cross match, 79%.

2572
00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:11.020
什么地点

他没打算藏起来
He's not exactly hiding.

2577
00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:17.020
队长
Captain,

2578
00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:18.360
看你了
you're up.

2579
00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:27.360

解锁

2587
00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:55.020
都给我跪下
Kneel before me.

2588
00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:00.770
我说了
I said

2589
00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:05.030
跪下
kneel!

2590
00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:17.700
这样不就简单了
Is not this simpler?

2591
00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:22.460
你们不是天生就该如此吗
Is this not your natural state?

2592
00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:27.970
这是人类没有道破的真理
It's the unspoken truth of humanity,

2593
00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:30.550
自由的诱惑剥夺了你们
that you crave subjugation.

2594
00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:34.890
生活中的快乐 你们渴望被奴役
The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life's joy

2595
00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:37.680
你们疯狂地追求权势 追求地位
in a mad scramble for power, for identity.

2596
00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:44.220
其实你们骨子里 充满了奴性
You were made to be ruled.

2597
00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:50.700
早晚 会屈从于你们的统治者
In the end, you will always kneel.

2598
00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:00.040
但不会是对你这种人
Not to men like you.

2599
00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:03.000
我可是独一无二的
There are no men like me.

2600
00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:06.750
你这样不要脸的人多了
There are always men like you.

2601
00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:09.880
你们看看这个老家伙
Look to your elder, people.

2602
00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:13.510
他就是你们的榜样
Let him be an example.

2603
00:41:20.310 --> 00:41:22.900
记得上次 我来德国的时候
You know, the last time I was in Germany,

2604
00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:26.270
也有一个人把自己凌驾于众人之上
and saw a man standing above everybody else,

2605
00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:27.940
结果被干掉了
we ended up disagreeing.

2606
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:30.110
是个大兵
The soldier.

2607
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:33.410
一个过时的人
The man out of time.

2608
00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:35.240
过时的人可不是我
I'm not the one who's out of time.

2609
00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:41.290
洛基 放下武器 投降
Loki, drop the weapon and stand down.

2610
00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:03.230
跪下
Kneel.

2611
00:42:03.350 --> 00:42:04.770
你做梦
Not today!

2612
00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:08.150
这家伙太狡猾了
The guy's all over the place.

2613
00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:13.990
罗曼诺夫特工 想我了吗
Agent Romanoff. You miss me?

2614
00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:15.490
系
统

2615
00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:15.490
改
写

2616
00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:32.800
再动一下 你这头驯鹿
Make your move, Reindeer Games.

2617
00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:42.310
很好
Good move.

2618
00:42:43.810 --> 00:42:45.100
史塔克先生
Mr Stark.

2619
00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:46.940
队长
Captain.

2620
00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:55.780
他说什么了吗
Is he saying anything?

2621
00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:57.240
没有
Not a word.

2622
00:42:57.530 --> 00:42:59.450
把他带过来 我们的时间很紧
Just get him here. We're low on time.

2623
00:43:02.490 --> 00:43:03.500
有点不对劲
I don't like it.

2624
00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:05.830
怎么 摇滚歌手投降得太容易了
What, Rock of Ages giving up so easily?

2625
00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:07.710
我觉得没这么简单
I don't remember it being that easy.

2626
00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:09.330
这家伙的实力很强
This guy packs a wallop.

2627
00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:13.130
对你这么一个老年人来说 观察力还行
Still, you are pretty spry for an older fellow.

2628
00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:15.760
你的秘诀是什么
What's your thing, Pilates?

2629
00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:16.930
什么
What?

2630
00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:18.090
你刚才的格斗
It's like calisthenics.

2631
00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:20.260
有点像健美操 这么多年
You might have missed a couple of things

2632
00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:22.100
真错过了不少发明
doing time as a Capsicle.

2633
00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:25.600
弗瑞没说 他把你也叫来了
Fury didn't tell me he was calling you in.

2634
00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:28.690
当然 弗瑞还有好多事没告诉你
Yeah, there's a lot of things Fury doesn't tell you.

2635
00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:30.650
这闪电从哪儿来的
Where's this coming from?

2636
00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:37.320
怎么了 难道你害怕闪电
What's the matter? Are you scared of a little lightning?

2637
00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:40.030
我不喜欢一会儿打雷的那家伙
I'm not overly fond of what follows.

2638
00:43:57.840 --> 00:43:59.010
你要干什么
What are you doing?

2639
00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:13.400
这家伙说来就来了
And now there's that guy.

2640
00:44:13.610 --> 00:44:15.360
又一个神域人吗
Another Asgardian?

2641
00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:16.600
那家伙是自己人
That guy's a friendly?

2642
00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:17.600
这不重要
Doesn't matter.

2643
00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:20.200
不管他是放了洛基还是杀了他 宇宙魔方都没了
If he frees Loki or kills him, the Tesseract's lost.

2644
00:44:20.410 --> 00:44:22.240
史塔克 得先制定作战计划
Stark, we need a plan of attack!

2645
00:44:22.450 --> 00:44:24.740
计划就是 作战
I have a plan. Attack.

2646
00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:32.540
我管不了他 队长
I'd sit this one out, Cap.

2647
00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:33.750
我也不想管
I don't see how I can.

2648
00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:36.590
这些都是传说中的人 他们基本上就是神
These guys come from legend. They're basically gods.

2649
00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:38.340
世界上只有一个神
There's only one God, ma'am.

2650
00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:40.840
但不会是那副打扮
And I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that.

2651
00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:57.690
宇宙魔方在哪儿
Where is the Tesseract?

2652
00:44:57.900 --> 00:44:59.190
好久不见 兄弟
I missed you, too.

2653
00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:01.070
我像是来跟你叙旧的吗
Do I look to be in a gaming mood?

2654
00:45:01.070 --> 00:45:06.070
无聊老生制作

2655
00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:03.160
你应该感谢我
You should thank me.

2656
00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:05.660
彩虹桥被摧毁后
With the Bifrost gone, how much dark energy

2657
00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:08.620
你知道奥丁得调动多少暗能量
did the Allfather have to muster to conjure you here

2658
00:45:08.830 --> 00:45:10.210
才能把你传送到你心爱的地球
to your precious Earth?

2659
00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:15.630
我还以为你死了
I thought you dead.

2660
00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:18.670
你哀悼我了
Did you mourn?

2661
00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:20.920
我们都哀悼了 我们的父亲
We all did. Our father...

2662
00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:24.180
是你的 父亲
Your father.

2663
00:45:26.050 --> 00:45:28.930
他和你说了我的身世了对吗
He did tell you my true parentage, did he not?

2664
00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:33.730
我们都是他养大的
We were raised together.

2665
00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:36.570
我们一起玩耍 一起战斗
We played together, we fought together.

2666
00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:36.940
一

2667
00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:36.940
姓名：索尔/雷神（Quinjet）
必修：《雷神》
身份：奥丁之子，洛基之兄，来自神域的雷电之神
超能：自幼锻炼体能超强，借助雷神之锤可以
召唤闪电御风飞行，具有毁灭性的打击力

2668
00:45:37.070 --> 00:45:38.280
难道你都忘了吗
Do you remember none of that?

2669
00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:40.440
我心里只有阴影
I remember a shadow.

2670
00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:44.990
我一直活在你的阴影里
Living in the shade of your greatness.

2671
00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:48.330
我永远忘不了是你把我扔到深渊里
I remember you tossing me into an abyss.

2672
00:45:48.450 --> 00:45:50.450
我是谁 我可是国王
I, who was, and should be, king!

2673
00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:52.750
所以你想霸占这个世界
So you take the world I love as a recompense

2674
00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:54.710
补偿你那莫名其妙的自卑感
for your imagined slights?

2675
00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:58.000
不 我一定会保护我钟爱的地球
No. The Earth is under my protection, Loki.

2676
00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:02.970
你保护得还真是很周到啊
And you're doing a marvellous job with that.

2677
00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:05.390
人类在成群结队地彼此厮杀
The humans slaughter each other in droves

2678
00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:07.300
你在一旁袖手旁观
while you idly fret.

2679
00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:09.680
我要去统治他们 你觉得我不能
I mean to rule them, as why should I not?

2680
00:46:09.890 --> 00:46:11.430
你觉得你比人类强大
You think yourself above them?

2681
00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:13.520
当然了
Well, yes.

2682
00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:16.190
你根本不懂什么叫统治 兄弟
Then you miss the truth of ruling, brother.

2683
00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:18.400
王位让你如坐针毡
A throne would suit you ill.

2684
00:46:23.610 --> 00:46:26.370
我见过你不知道的新世界
I've seen worlds you've never known about!

2685
00:46:26.570 --> 00:46:30.740
我被流放的时候 苍天有眼 我因祸得福
I have grown, Odinson, in my exile.

2686
00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:33.080
我见识了魔方的真正力量
I have seen the true power of the Tesseract,

2687
00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:34.290
等我掌握它的时候
and when I wield it...

2688
00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:36.250
是谁让你见识的
Who showed you this power?

2689
00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:38.750
你的幕后黑手是谁
Who controls the would-be king?

2690
00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:39.960
我就是国王
I am a king!

2691
00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:40.960
别做梦了
Not here!

2692
00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:42.260
交出宇宙魔方
You give up the Tesseract!

2693
00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:44.930
放弃这些荒唐的梦想
You give up this poisonous dream!

2694
00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:49.010
跟我回家吧
You come home.

2695
00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:55.100
不在我这里
I don't have it.

2696
00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:58.980
你需要魔方才能把我带回去
You need the Cube to bring me home.

2697
00:46:59.110 --> 00:47:01.440
但它不见了 我也不知道它在哪儿
But I've sent it off, I know not where.

2698
00:47:02.570 --> 00:47:04.400
你听好了 兄弟
You listen well, brother.

2699
00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:07.570
我听着呢
I'm listening.

2700
00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:18.380
你敢再碰我一下
Do not touch me again.

2701
00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:20.170
那你别抢我东西
Then don't take my stuff.

2702
00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:22.630
你知不知道 你在和谁说话
You have no idea what you're dealing with.

2703
00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:25.510
你是话剧演员
Shakespeare in the Park?

2704
00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:30.010
你妈妈知道你偷了她的披肩吗
Doth Mother know you wear-eth her drapes?

2705
00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:33.020
管你该管的事情吧 铁皮人
This is beyond you, metal man.

2706
00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:35.350
洛基一定会受到神域的审判
Loki will face Asgardian justice.

2707
00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:38.940
只要他交出魔方 随便你 在这之前
He gives up the Cube, he's all yours. Until then,

2708
00:47:39.310 --> 00:47:40.560
最好别碍事
stay out of the way.

2709
00:47:42.110 --> 00:47:43.730
外乡人
Tourist.

2710
00:47:49.110 --> 00:47:50.160
来吧
Okay.

2711
00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:22.860
能量达到400%
Power at 400% capacity.

2712
00:48:23.070 --> 00:48:24.610
怎么会这样
How about that?

2713
00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:26.130
嗨
Hey!

2714
00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:29.880
都给我住手
That's enough.

2715
00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:35.470
你来这儿的目的是什么
Now, I don't know what you plan on doing here.

2716
00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:37.970
我来这儿是为了阻止洛基的阴谋
I've come here to put an end to Loki's schemes.

2717
00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:40.730
证明给我们看 把你的锤子放下
Then prove it. Put that hammer down.

2718
00:49:40.850 --> 00:49:41.850
呃 不
Yeah... No.

2719
00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:43.560
不是好主意 他超爱他的锤子
Bad call. He loves his hammer.

2720
00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:47.400
你想让我放下我的锤子
You want me to put the hammer down?

2721
00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:16.430
都闹够了吗
Are we done, here?

2722
00:51:04.310 --> 00:51:07.270
说说你目前的处境
In case it's unclear,

2723
00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:09.770
如果你想逃跑
if you try to escape,

2724
00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:13.150
哪怕只是轻轻挠一下玻璃
if you so much as scratch that glass,

2725
00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:26.710
你就会带着这个铁笼子 从30000米的高空自由落下去
it's 30,000 feet straight down in a steel trap.

2726
00:51:27.250 --> 00:51:29.380
你都清楚了
You get how that works?

2727
00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:34.050
蚂蚁 你的鞋
Ant, boot.

2728
00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:39.140
这东西设计得不错
It's an impressive cage.

2729
00:51:40.050 --> 00:51:42.680
应该不是给我用的 对吧
Not built, I think, for me.

2730
00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:45.480
本来要关的东西比你凶得多
Built for something a lot stronger than you.

2731
00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:47.560
我听说了
Oh, I've heard.

2732
00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:49.730
是一个狂暴的野兽
A mindless beast.

2733
00:51:50.730 --> 00:51:52.360
还假装自己是普通人
Makes play he's still a man.

2734
00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:55.690
你得多绝望
How desperate are you,

2735
00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:58.990
才需要找这种怪物来保护你
that you call on such lost creatures to defend you?

2736
00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:01.530
我得多绝望
How desperate am I?

2737
00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:03.540
你用战争威胁我们
You threaten my world with war.

2738
00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:05.870
你偷走了根本控制不了的东西
You steal a force you can't hope to control.

2739
00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:09.880
其实在你心里 杀戮 就是你最大的乐趣
You talk about peace, and you kill because it's fun.

2740
00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:13.090
告诉你 你的确让我很绝望
You have made me very desperate.

2741
00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:15.210
但是我会让你后悔的
You might not be glad that you did.

2742
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:21.760
功亏一篑的感觉让你很懊恼吧
It burns you to have come so close.

2743
00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:25.930
你差一点就获得了魔方的能量
To have the Tesseract, to have power,

2744
00:52:26.730 --> 00:52:28.940
无止尽的能量
unlimited power.

2745
00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:31.100
你的目的呢
And for what?

2746
00:52:32.770 --> 00:52:36.570
让全人类分享温暖
A warm light for all mankind to share.

2747
00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:40.070
现在你算是见识到它真正的力量了
And then to be reminded what real power is.

2748
00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:48.460
你所谓的真正的力量 无非是想上杂志封面
Well, let me know if "real power" wants a magazine or something.

2749
00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:55.800
监控画面

2750
00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:58.260
这家伙可真够啰嗦的
He really grows on you, doesn't he?

2751
00:52:58.470 --> 00:53:00.380
我看他是故意的
Loki's gonna drag this out.

2752
00:53:00.590 --> 00:53:04.050
索尔 你说 他想干什么
So, Thor, what's his play?

2753
00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:06.810
他手下有支军队叫齐塔瑞
He has an army called the Chitauri.

2754
00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:09.940
他们不是神域人 不属于任何星球
They're not of Asgard, nor any world known.

2755
00:53:10.350 --> 00:53:12.440
洛基打算带着他们进攻地球
He means to lead them against your people.

2756
00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:14.230
他们一定会帮他的
They will win him the Earth,

2757
00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:16.150
我想条件是那个宇宙魔方
in return, I suspect, for the Tesseract.

2758
00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:18.110
一支军队
An army

2759
00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:19.990
来自外星空间
from outer space.

2760
00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:22.610
这么说他想打开传送门
So, he's building another portal.

2761
00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:24.160
所以带走了席尔维格博士
That's what he needs Erik Selvig for.

2762
00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:25.280
席尔维格
Selvig?

2763
00:53:25.450 --> 00:53:26.490
他是个天文学家
He's an astrophysicist.

2764
00:53:26.490 --> 00:53:27.490
他是我朋友
He's a friend.

2765
00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:30.120
洛基用法术控制了他
Loki has him under some kind of spell,

2766
00:53:30.290 --> 00:53:31.790
还有我们的一个同事
along with one of ours.

2767
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.580
我不懂为什么洛基会投降
I want to know why Loki let us take him.

2768
00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:35.000
他在这儿怎么指挥军队
He's not leading an army from here.

2769
00:53:35.210 --> 00:53:36.920
我觉得不应该把注意力放在洛基身上
I don't think we should be focusing on Loki.

2770
00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:38.920
这家伙的想法难以捉摸
That guy's brain is a bag full of cats.

2771
00:53:39.050 --> 00:53:40.340
要我说他就是个疯子
You could smell crazy on him.

2772
00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:42.300
你说话最好小心点
Have care how you speak.

2773
00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:45.050
洛基的确蛮不讲理 但他是神域人
Loki is beyond reason, but he is of Asgard.

2774
00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:46.560
而且我们是兄弟
And he is my brother.

2775
00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:48.640
他在两天里杀了80个人
He killed 80 people in two days.

2776
00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:50.520
我们是表亲
He's adopted.

2777
00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:52.980
我觉得他的计划跟机械有关
I think it's about the mechanics.

2778
00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:55.150
金属铱 他们要铱做什么
Iridium... What do they need the iridium for?

2779
00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:56.360
可以用作稳定剂
It's a stabilising agent.

2780
00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:57.820
我说 你挑个周末
I'm just saying, pick a weekend.

2781
00:53:57.940 --> 00:53:59.490
我可以带你去波特兰
I'll fly you to Portland.

2782
00:53:59.690 --> 00:54:01.240
感情要多沟通
Keep love alive.

2783
00:54:01.450 --> 00:54:03.320
这样 新传送门
It means the portal won't collapse on itself

2784
00:54:03.490 --> 00:54:05.320
就不会像神盾局的那样崩塌了
like it did at S.H.I.E.L.D.

2785
00:54:05.530 --> 00:54:08.830
不打不相识 大明星 你的锤子很给力
No hard feelings, Point Break. You've got a mean swing.

2786
00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:11.290
另外 根据洛基的需要
Also, it means the portal can open as wide

2787
00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:13.920
那个传送门可以变得更大 持续时间更长
and stay open as long, as Loki wants.

2788
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:16.840
呃 升起主帆 准备出发
Raise the mizzenmast. Jib the topsails.

2789
00:54:18.550 --> 00:54:19.760
那个人在玩游戏
That man is playing Galaga.

2790
00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:24.180
他以为没人注意 被我发现了
He thought we wouldn't notice, but we did.

2791
00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:27.510
弗瑞怎么看这边
How does Fury even see these?

2792
00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:28.680
转过身
He turns.

2793
00:54:28.970 --> 00:54:30.600
不觉得累吗
Sounds exhausting.

2794
00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:32.850
他们需要的其他资料
The rest of the raw materials,

2795
00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:35.850
巴顿应该很容易就弄到手
Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily.

2796
00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:37.440
目前他还需要一样
The only major component he still needs

2797
00:54:37.650 --> 00:54:41.150
具有高密度能量的动力源
is a power source of high-energy density.

2798
00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:44.610
是用来启动魔方的 应该  差不多了
Something to kick-start the Cube.

2799
00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:47.780
你什么时候变成热核天体物理学家了
When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics?

2800
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.990
昨天晚上
Last night.

2801
00:54:49.490 --> 00:54:52.700
科尔森的报告 席尔维格的笔记 关于萃取理论的文章
The packet, Selvig's notes, the extraction theory papers.

2802
00:54:52.910 --> 00:54:53.910
只有我一个人做功课吗
Am I the only one who did the reading?

2803
00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:56.880
洛基是否需要某种特别的动力源
Does Loki need any particular kind of power source?

2804
00:54:57.080 --> 00:54:59.800
他至少要把魔方加热到1亿度
He would have to heat the Cube to 120-million Kelvin

2805
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.460
才能达到理论上的要求
just to break through the Coulomb barrier.

2806
00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:03.880
除非席尔维格能找到某种方法
Unless Selvig has figured out how to stabilise

2807
00:55:04.090 --> 00:55:05.220
来稳定量子隧道效应
the quantum tunnelling effect.

2808
00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:06.430
如果他能做到的话
Well, if he could do that,

2809
00:55:06.590 --> 00:55:09.050
他可以让地球上的任何一个反应堆 实现离子聚变
he could achieve heavy ion fusion at any reactor on the planet.

2810
00:55:09.260 --> 00:55:11.680
看看 还是有懂行的
Finally, someone who speaks English.

2811
00:55:11.890 --> 00:55:13.850
刚刚发生了什么
Is that what just happened?

2812
00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:16.060
很高兴见到你 班纳博士
It's good to meet you, Dr Banner.

2813
00:55:16.270 --> 00:55:19.310
你的正电子碰撞领域的成就 真的是无与伦比
Your work on antielectron collisions is unparalleled.

2814
00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:21.320
我是你的超级粉丝 很欣赏你一发脾气
And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control

2815
00:55:21.530 --> 00:55:23.570
就变成一个绿色大怪兽
and turn into an enormous green rage-monster.

2816
00:55:25.110 --> 00:55:26.160
多谢
Thanks.

2817
00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:28.870
班纳博士是来帮我们追踪魔方的
Dr Banner is only here to track the Cube.

2818
00:55:29.070 --> 00:55:30.370
希望你能助他一臂之力
I was hoping you might join him.

2819
00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:31.740
我会从洛基的权杖入手
I would start with that stick of his.

2820
00:55:31.870 --> 00:55:32.910
那东西很像九头蛇的武器
It may be magical,

2821
00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:34.330
可能真有魔力
but it works an awful lot like a HYDRA weapon.

2822
00:55:34.450 --> 00:55:37.500
这我可说不准 但它通过魔方获得能量
I don't know about that, but it is powered by the Cube.

2823
00:55:37.790 --> 00:55:39.540
我需要知道 洛基是怎么用它
And I would like to know how Loki used it

2824
00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:41.340
把我认识的两个最靠谱的人
to turn two of the sharpest men I know

2825
00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:43.260
变成供他指使的猴子
into his personal flying monkeys.

2826
00:55:43.630 --> 00:55:45.170
变成猴子 什么意思
Monkeys? I do not understand.

2827
00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:46.300
我知道
I do.

2828
00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:51.180
这回我可听明白了
I understood that reference.

2829
00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:53.430
我们开工 博士
Shall we play, Doctor?

2830
00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:55.350
这边请 先生
This way, sir.

2831
00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:10.910
伽马读数和席尔维格
The gamma readings are definitely consistent

2832
00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:13.120
对魔方的报告是一致的
with Selvig's reports of the Tesseract.

2833
00:56:13.490 --> 00:56:15.120
但处理起来需要花几周的时间
But it's going to take weeks to process.

2834
00:56:15.330 --> 00:56:16.540
绕过神盾局的主系统
If we bypass their mainframe

2835
00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:17.960
进入到分系统群
and direct route to the Homer cluster,

2836
00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:21.250
就能把它加速到 每秒600万亿次浮点运算
we can clock this at around 600 teraflops.

2837
00:56:22.420 --> 00:56:24.380
可惜我只带了一根牙刷
All I packed was a toothbrush.

2838
00:56:25.460 --> 00:56:27.050
你有空到史塔克大厦来坐坐
You know, you should come by Stark Tower sometime.

2839
00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:29.300
顶上十层 都是用来研发的
Top ten floors, all R&D.

2840
00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:31.090
你会开心的
You'd love it. It's Candy Land.

2841
00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:33.810
谢谢 但是我上次去纽约
Thanks, but the last time I was in New York,

2842
00:56:34.010 --> 00:56:36.560
几乎把整个哈莱姆区  毁了
I kind of broke Harlem.

2843
00:56:36.770 --> 00:56:38.600
我保证不会让你感受到什么压力
Well, I promise a stress-free environment.

2844
00:56:38.810 --> 00:56:40.600
不会让你神经紧张 或者出什么意外
No tension, no surprises.

2845
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:42.510
嗨
Hey!

2846
00:56:42.510 --> 00:56:43.610
没反应
Nothing?

2847
00:56:43.820 --> 00:56:44.820
你疯了
Are you nuts?

2848
00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:45.940
目前没有
Jury's out.

2849
00:56:46.070 --> 00:56:47.190
看来你的自控能力不错
You really have got a lid on it, haven't you?

2850
00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:48.320
有什么秘诀
What's your secret?

2851
00:56:48.450 --> 00:56:49.910
听音乐还是吃什么药
Mellowjazz, bongo drums, huge bag of weed?

2852
00:56:50.070 --> 00:56:51.200
你总是这样没正行吗
Is everything a joke to you?

2853
00:56:51.490 --> 00:56:52.490
那得分谁
Funny things are.

2854
00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:55.740
你刚才的做法 可能会威胁到大家的安全
Threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isn't funny.

2855
00:56:55.870 --> 00:56:56.870
对不起 博士
No offence, Doc.

2856
00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.500
哦 没关系
It's all right, I wouldn't have come aboard

2857
00:56:58.620 --> 00:57:01.460
如果我连这点刺激都接受不了 我就不会上船了
if I couldn't handle pointy things.

2858
00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:04.170
你太谨慎了 大块头 得张扬一点
You're tip-toeing, big man. You need to strut.

2859
00:57:04.290 --> 00:57:05.960
你该集中精力解决问题 史塔克先生
And you need to focus on the problem, Mr Stark.

2860
00:57:06.090 --> 00:57:07.590
我没有吗
Do you think I'm not?

2861
00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:10.510
弗瑞为什么招我们来 为什么现在 他有什么内幕
Why did Fury call us in? Why now? Why not before?

2862
00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:12.390
一直瞒着我们
What isn't he telling us?

2863
00:57:12.510 --> 00:57:14.260
不了解真相 就得不到正确的结论
I can't do the equation unless I have all the variables.

2864
00:57:14.890 --> 00:57:16.140
你认为弗瑞有所隐瞒
You think Fury's hiding something?

2865
00:57:16.270 --> 00:57:19.430
他是个特工 特工之王 队长
He's a spy. Captain, he's "the" spy.

2866
00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:21.310
他背后有更多的秘密
His secrets have secrets.

2867
00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:22.940
班纳也有同感 嗯
It's bugging him, too. Isn't it?

2868
00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:27.320
我只是想完成我的工作 而且
I just want to finish my work here, and...

2869
00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:28.440
博士
Doctor?

2870
00:57:33.870 --> 00:57:36.240
让全人类分享温暖
"A warm light for all mankind."

2871
00:57:36.370 --> 00:57:38.450
这是刚才洛基对弗瑞说的话
Loki's jab at Fury about the Cube.

2872
00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:40.040
我听到了
I heard it.

2873
00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:42.460
我觉得他是说给你听的
I think that was meant for you.

2874
00:57:43.170 --> 00:57:46.130
即使巴顿没跟洛基说起过史塔克大厦
Even if Barton didn't tell Loki about the tower,

2875
00:57:46.250 --> 00:57:47.340
新闻上也都说了
it was still all over the news.

2876
00:57:47.460 --> 00:57:49.550
史塔克大厦 那个又大又丑的
The Stark Tower? That big, ugly

2877
00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:52.130
在纽约的那栋
building in New York?

2878
00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:55.970
由方舟反应炉供能 能源可自我再生
It's powered by an arc reactor, a self-sustaining energy source.

2879
00:57:56.100 --> 00:57:58.520
那大厦能自给自足一年吗
That building will run itself for, what, a year?

2880
00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:00.480
只是个原型机
It's just the prototype.

2881
00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:02.560
目前我可是清洁能源领域的第一人
I'm kind of the only name in clean energy right now.

2882
00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:04.400
他们也要这个
That's what he's getting at.

2883
00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:07.110
那么 为什么神盾局 不招你加入魔方工程呢
So, why didn't S.H.I.E.L.D. bring him in on the Tesseract project?

2884
00:58:07.230 --> 00:58:10.440
我是说他们涉足能源产业 又是为了什么呢
What are they doing in the energy business in the first place?

2885
00:58:10.570 --> 00:58:13.530
我确实应该调查一下
I should probably look into that once my decryption programme

2886
00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:15.820
一旦我的破解程序 侵入神盾局的机密档案
finishes breaking into all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s secure files.

2887
00:58:15.950 --> 00:58:16.950
等等 你是想
I'm sorry. Did you say...

2888
00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:19.080
我上船后 贾维斯一直在破解程序
Jarvis has been running it since I hit the bridge.

2889
00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:22.080
几小时后我就会知道神盾局所有不可告人的秘密了
In a few hours, I'll know every dirty secret S.H.I.E.L.D. has ever tried to hide.

2890
00:58:22.210 --> 00:58:23.210
吃吗
Blueberry?

2891
00:58:23.330 --> 00:58:25.210
不招你加入魔方工程 你想不通是吧
Yet you're confused about why they didn't want you around.

2892
00:58:25.330 --> 00:58:28.170
情报机构居然会怕聪明人
An intelligence organisation that fears intelligence?

2893
00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:29.880
这未免太丢人了 不可能
Historically, not awesome.

2894
00:58:30.010 --> 00:58:32.300
洛基就是想让我们相互质疑
I think Loki's trying to wind us up.

2895
00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:34.010
他图谋发动战争
This is a man who means to start a war

2896
00:58:34.130 --> 00:58:35.680
如果我们不能专心致志 他就会得手
and if we don't stay focused, he'll succeed.

2897
00:58:36.970 --> 00:58:39.430
我们都有命令在身 应该服从命令
We have orders. We should follow them.

2898
00:58:39.930 --> 00:58:41.930
服从命令可不是我的作风
Following's not really my style.

2899
00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:45.520
你只想自己出风头 是吗
And you're all about style, aren't you?

2900
00:58:45.650 --> 00:58:46.690
这屋里的人当中
Of the people in this room,

2901
00:58:46.810 --> 00:58:48.400
是谁穿着华丽的戏服走来走去
which one is, A, wearing a spangly outfit,

2902
00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:49.860
而且 又很没用
and, B, not of use?

2903
00:58:49.980 --> 00:58:54.320
说的是啊 你真没觉得你的穿戴有些不自在吗
Steve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you.

2904
00:58:57.030 --> 00:58:58.080
尽快找到魔方
Just find the Cube.

2905
00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:12.920
这就是我老爸推崇备至的家伙
That's the guy my dad never shut up about?

2906
00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:16.180
我觉得应该考虑再把他冷冻回去
I'm wondering if they shouldn't have kept him on ice.

2907
00:59:17.010 --> 00:59:18.720
他对洛基的判断是对的
The guy's not wrong about Loki.

2908
00:59:18.850 --> 00:59:20.600
比我们的思维更慎密
He does have the jump on us.

2909
00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:23.430
简直就像 马戏团的小丑
What he's got is an Acme dynamite kit.

2910
00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:25.390
早晚有演砸的时候
It's going to blow up in his face.

2911
00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:27.810
我就等着看好戏吧
And I'm going to be there when it does.

2912
00:59:28.110 --> 00:59:30.270
那我看看报纸吧
Yeah. I'll read all about it.

2913
00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:33.690
要不你也和我们一起变装上阵
Or you'll be suiting up with the rest of us.

2914
00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:38.870
算了吧 我可没有你的护甲
You see, I don't get a suit of armour.

2915
00:59:38.990 --> 00:59:42.330
凭我这肉身 就去玩命
I'm exposed. Like a nerve.

2916
00:59:42.450 --> 00:59:44.200
别开玩笑了
It's a nightmare.

2917
00:59:44.330 --> 00:59:47.120
你知道 每分每秒都有 一堆细小的弹片
I've got a cluster of shrapnel trying every second

2918
00:59:47.250 --> 00:59:49.250
试图钻入我的心脏
to crawl its way into my heart.

2919
00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:51.420
是这个 保护了我
This stops it.

2920
00:59:51.550 --> 00:59:53.880
这个小光环已经是我的一部分了
This little circle of light, it's part of me now,

2921
00:59:55.090 --> 00:59:56.760
它不仅是护甲
not just armour.

2922
00:59:57.430 --> 00:59:59.890
是一种可怕的恩赐
It's a terrible privilege.

2923
01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:01.300
但你完全可以控制它
But you can control it.

2924
01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:02.300
无聊老生制作

2925
01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:02.700
因为我学会了方法
Because I learned how.

2926
01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:03.720
我不一样
It's different.

2927
01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:07.390
嗨 我对你的遭遇一清二楚
Hey, I read all about your accident.

2928
01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:10.860
那么强的伽马射线 足以杀死你
That much gamma exposure should have killed you.

2929
01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:13.440
你的意思是说另一个我
So you're saying that the Hulk...

2930
01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:17.280
也就是浩克 救了我的命
The other guy saved my life?

2931
01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:18.910
这想法不错
That's nice.

2932
01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:23.580
可他为什么救我 他的目的是 什么
It's a nice sentiment. Saved it for what?

2933
01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:26.790
我们会知道的
I guess we'll find out.

2934
01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:30.170
那时候你就乐不起来了
You may not enjoy that.

2935
01:00:30.290 --> 01:00:32.250
你可能会
And you just might.

2936
01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:37.300
机密仓库

2937
01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:32.860
洛基掳走博士之后
As soon as Loki took the doctor,

2938
01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:35.500
一

2939
01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:35.500
姓名：简·福斯特（Jane Foster）
必修：《雷神》
身份：席尔维格博士的学生，索尔的地球女友。
超能：无

2940
01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:36.600
简·福斯特

2941
01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:34.230
我们转移了简·福斯特
we moved Jane Foster.

2942
01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:37.230
在挪威有个非常好的天文台
They've got an excellent observatory in Troms.

2943
01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:40.900
昨天已经有人把她请过去当顾问了
She was asked to consult there very suddenly yesterday.

2944
01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:44.830
报酬很好 私人飞机 还很偏僻
Handsome fee, private plane, very remote.

2945
01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:46.740
她会非常安全
She'll be safe.

2946
01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:48.250
谢谢
Thank you.

2947
01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:52.080
洛基带走席尔维格 绝对不是巧合
It's no accident, Loki taking Erik Selvig.

2948
01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:55.670
我担心洛基完事后 对他下毒手
I dread what he plans for him once he's done.

2949
01:01:55.790 --> 01:01:56.920
席尔维格是个好人
Erik is a good man.

2950
01:01:57.050 --> 01:01:58.050
他常常提起你
He talks about you a lot.

2951
01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:01.930
你改变了他的人生
You changed his life.

2952
01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:05.510
你也改变了这里的一切
You changed everything around here.

2953
01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:07.760
还是我来之前好
They were better as they were.

2954
01:02:08.350 --> 01:02:10.430
在神域 我们假装自己发达
We pretend on Asgard that we're more advanced

2955
01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:14.270
到这儿后 我们就像巨型锥鸟一样打仗
but we come here, battling like bilge snipe.

2956
01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:16.230
- 像什么 - 巨型锥鸟
- Like what? - Bilge snipe.

2957
01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:19.400
超大 有鳞和一对大角
You know, huge, scaly, big antlers.

2958
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:21.990
- 这儿没有吗 - 应该没有
- You don't have those? - I don't think so.

2959
01:02:22.110 --> 01:02:23.990
这东西很讨厌
Well, they are repulsive.

2960
01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:27.580
它们不管到哪儿都一路破坏
And they trample everything in their path.

2961
01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:38.590
我第一次来地球的时候 洛基对我的仇恨也跟了过来
When I first came to Earth, Loki's rage followed me here,

2962
01:02:38.710 --> 01:02:41.050
你们的人也付出了代价
and your people paid the price.

2963
01:02:41.170 --> 01:02:42.970
现在又是这样
And now, again.

2964
01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:47.970
年轻的时候 我曾渴望战争
In my youth, I courted war.

2965
01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:51.730
战争还没开始呢
War hasn't started yet.

2966
01:02:52.850 --> 01:02:54.650
你觉得你能让洛基告诉我们
You think you could make Loki tell us

2967
01:02:54.770 --> 01:02:56.060
魔方在哪儿吗
where the Tesseract is?

2968
01:02:56.190 --> 01:02:59.440
我不知道 没人能摸透洛基的想法
I do not know. Loki's mind is far afield.

2969
01:02:59.570 --> 01:03:04.280
他要的不仅是权势 还有对我的 报复
It's not just power he craves, it's vengeance, upon me.

2970
01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:06.530
为达目的 他能忍受任何痛苦
There's no pain would prise his need from him.

2971
01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:09.830
有句老话说的好
A lot of guys think that

2972
01:03:09.950 --> 01:03:11.450
不见棺材不落泪
until the pain starts.

2973
01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:15.250
你想让我做什么
What are you asking me to do?

2974
01:03:15.370 --> 01:03:18.960
应该说 是你自己打算怎么去做
I'm asking, what are you prepared to do?

2975
01:03:19.090 --> 01:03:20.130
洛基是个囚犯
Loki is a prisoner.

2976
01:03:20.250 --> 01:03:22.590
我怎么觉得他是唯一一个
Then why do I feel like he's the only person on this boat

2977
01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:24.300
想留在这艘船上的人
that wants to be here?

2978
01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:39.980
能偷偷摸摸接近我的人可不多
There's not many people who can sneak up on me.

2979
01:03:40.110 --> 01:03:41.780
你猜到我该来了
But you figured I'd come.

2980
01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:44.030
还用说吗
After.

2981
01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:48.320
无论弗瑞那家伙用什么酷刑折磨我
After whatever tortures Fury can concoct,

2982
01:03:48.450 --> 01:03:52.120
你总会像老朋友一样 准时出现
you would appear as a friend, as a balm.

2983
01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:54.750
我真是太感动了
And I would cooperate.

2984
01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:56.870
我想知道你对巴顿做了什么
I want to know what you've done to Agent Barton.

2985
01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
我只是开阔了他的思维
I would say I've expanded his mind.

2986
01:04:01.590 --> 01:04:03.510
那等你赢了之后
And once you've won,

2987
01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:05.670
等你如愿以偿之后
once you're king of the mountain,

2988
01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:10.300
巴顿的思维会变成什么样
what happens to his mind?

2989
01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:13.350
你爱他 罗曼诺夫特工
Is this love, Agent Romanoff?

2990
01:04:13.470 --> 01:04:16.310
爱是小孩的事 我欠他个人情
Love is for children. I owe him a debt.

2991
01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:22.070
跟我说说
Tell me.

2992
01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:29.660
在加入神盾局之前
Before I worked for S.H.I.E.L.D... I...

2993
01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:36.000
我是名声在外
Well, I made a name for myself.

2994
01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:39.120
我有 我有一些很独特的技能
I have a very specific skill set.

2995
01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:42.920
其实我不在乎是为谁卖命 或者是去要谁的命
I didn't care who I used it for, or on.

2996
01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:47.420
所以 我上了神盾局的黑名单
I got on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s radar in a bad way.

2997
01:04:48.590 --> 01:04:51.510
巴顿特工被派来杀我
Agent Barton was sent to kill me.

2998
01:04:52.550 --> 01:04:54.100
但他没那么做
He made a different call.

2999
01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:59.100
如果我答应放过他 你能为我做什么
And what will you do if I vow to spare him?

3000
01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:00.810
我不会放你的
Not let you out.

3001
01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:02.820
有意思 跟我讨价还价
No, but I like this.

3002
01:05:03.730 --> 01:05:07.150
你自己都泥菩萨过河 还想着惦记别人
Your world in the balance, and you bargain for one man.

3003
01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:09.360
政治跟我没关系
Regimes fall every day.

3004
01:05:09.490 --> 01:05:12.030
我从来就不关心这个 我是
I tend not to weep over that. I'm Russian.

3005
01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:13.160
曾经是俄国人
Or I was.

3006
01:05:14.450 --> 01:05:16.120
你现在是什么
And what are you now?

3007
01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:19.540
事情没你想得那么复杂
It's really not that complicated.

3008
01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:23.750
我只是有一笔债 非还不可的债
I got red in my ledger, I'd like to wipe it out.

3009
01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:26.300
是吗
Can you?

3010
01:05:27.630 --> 01:05:31.430
你能还清你欠下的所有血债吗
Can you wipe out that much red?

3011
01:05:32.590 --> 01:05:34.390
德雷科夫的女儿
Dreykov's daughter,

3012
01:05:35.810 --> 01:05:37.640
圣保罗
StoPaulo,

3013
01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:41.190
那场医院的大火
the hospital fire?

3014
01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:44.400
巴顿什么都和我说了
Barton told me everything.

3015
01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:47.610
你的账单在滴血 你的血债太多了
Your ledger is dripping. It's gushing red

3016
01:05:47.730 --> 01:05:50.240
你觉得救一个比你高尚不到哪儿去的人
and you think saving a man no more virtuous than yourself

3017
01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:51.740
能改变什么吗
will change anything?

3018
01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:54.530
这是最低级的恻隐之心
This is the basest sentimentality.

3019
01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:56.910
简直太幼稚 可笑
This is a child at prayer.

3020
01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:58.330
太可悲了
Pathetic!

3021
01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:01.710
你满口谎言 手上沾满鲜血
You lie and kill

3022
01:06:01.830 --> 01:06:04.710
为骗子和杀手卖命
in the service of liars and killers.

病毒检测
未经授权访问

3027
01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:11.130
你自命清高 以为有自己的准则
You pretend to be separate, to have your own code,

3028
01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:13.970
以为这样就能抵销自己的罪孽
something that makes up for the horrors.

3029
01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:17.560
但那是你的本性
But they are part of you.

3030
01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:21.480
永远永远都不会 消失
And they will never go away.

3031
01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:25.560
我不会伤害巴顿 至少让他干掉你之前
I won't touch Barton, not until I make him kill you.

3032
01:06:25.690 --> 01:06:27.940
慢慢地 温柔地
Slowly, intimately,

3033
01:06:28.070 --> 01:06:30.440
他对你的恐惧无所不知
in every way he knows you fear.

3034
01:06:30.570 --> 01:06:33.660
我会给他足够长的时间 让他意识到自己干了什么
And then he'll wake just long enough to see his good work

3035
01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:37.240
等他仰天长啸 我再敲碎他的脑袋
and when he screams, I'll split his skull.

3036
01:06:37.370 --> 01:06:40.500
这就是我给你的价码 你这个小贱货
This is my bargain, you mewling quim.

3037
01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:43.670
你这个疯子
You're a monster.

3038
01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:47.380
哦 不
Oh, no.

3039
01:06:48.250 --> 01:06:49.840
疯子还没出来呢
You brought the monster.

3040
01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:54.430
原来 班纳
So, Banner.

3041
01:06:55.470 --> 01:06:56.640
是你的目的
That's your play.

3042
01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:57.810
什么
What?

3043
01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:00.430
洛基打算利用班纳
Loki means to unleash the Hulk.

3044
01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:02.020
如果他在实验室 不要让他离开
Keep Banner in the lab. I'm on my way.

3045
01:07:02.140 --> 01:07:03.230
让索尔马上过去
Send Thor as well.

3046
01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:06.230
谢谢
Thank you

3047
01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:08.520
多谢你的配合
for your cooperation.

3048
01:07:16.030 --> 01:07:17.490
你在干什么 史塔克先生
What are you doing, Mr Stark?

3049
01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:20.120
呃 我也正想问你这个问题
Kind of been wondering the same thing about you.

3050
01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:22.120
你应该去想办法找出魔方的位置
You're supposed to be locating the Tesseract.

3051
01:07:22.250 --> 01:07:23.830
想着呢 信号已经锁定
We are. The model's locked

3052
01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:25.250
正在搜索伽马射线的标记
and we're sweeping for the signature now.

3053
01:07:25.370 --> 01:07:26.380
找到后
When we get a hit,

3054
01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:28.460
会把目标锁定在半英里内
we'll have the location within half a mile.

3055
01:07:28.590 --> 01:07:31.240
伽马射线定位

3056
01:07:28.590 --> 01:07:31.240
搜索...

3057
01:07:31.590 --> 01:07:32.240
授予访问权限

3058
01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:33.940
第2阶段

3059
01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:32.640
绝密

3060
01:07:28.590 --> 01:07:32.840
之后就能拿回你的魔方了 别着急
Yeah, then you get your Cube back. No muss, no fuss.

3061
01:07:32.970 --> 01:07:34.090
什么是第2阶段
What is "Phase 2"?

3062
01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:39.140
第2阶段 就是神盾局用魔方来制造武器
Phase 2 is S.H.I.E.L.D. uses the Cube to make weapons.

3063
01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:41.010
抱歉 电脑的速度对我来说太慢了
Sorry, computer was moving a little slow for me.

3064
01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:43.850
先生们 我们搜集一切和魔方有关的东西
Rogers, we gathered everything related to the Tesseract.

3065
01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:45.440
但这并不代表我们在制造
This does not mean that we're making...

3066
01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:46.560
得了吧 尼克
I'm sorry, Nick.

3067
01:07:46.690 --> 01:07:48.980
你别狡辩了
What were you lying?

3068
01:07:49.110 --> 01:07:50.360
我错了 指挥官
I was wrong, Director.

3069
01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:51.530
这个世界一点都没变
The world hasn't changed a bit.

3070
01:07:51.650 --> 01:07:52.690
你知道这情况吗
Did you know about this?

3071
01:07:52.820 --> 01:07:55.610
你难道不想离开这个地方吗 博士
You want to think about removing yourself from this environment, Doctor?

3072
01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:57.910
我当时可在加尔各答啊 跟我没什么关系
I was in Calcutta. I was pretty well removed.

3073
01:07:58.030 --> 01:07:59.200
洛基在利用你
Loki is manipulating you.

3074
01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:00.910
那你的目的又是什么呢
And you've been doing what, exactly?

3075
01:08:01.030 --> 01:08:02.700
你到这儿来 不是因为我冲你抛媚眼
You didn't come here because I bat my eyelashes at you.

3076
01:08:02.830 --> 01:08:03.950
那我走
Yes, and I'm not leaving

3077
01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:05.370
也不是因为你神经兮兮的
because suddenly you get a little twitchy.

3078
01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:07.120
我需要知道的是 为什么神盾局
I'd like to know why S.H.I.E.L.D.

3079
01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:10.960
在利用魔方 制造大规模杀伤性武器
is using the Tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction.

3080
01:08:11.590 --> 01:08:12.710
就因为他
Because of him.

3081
01:08:14.010 --> 01:08:15.010
我
Me?

3082
01:08:15.970 --> 01:08:18.340
去年地球迎来了一个从外星来的访客
Last year, Earth had a visitor from another planet

3083
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:21.640
他的一些个人恩怨 导致一座小镇被夷为平地
who had a grudge match that levelled a small town.

3084
01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:23.970
我们得知了宇宙中不但有别的生命
We learned that not only are we not alone

3085
01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:27.690
还比我们强大得多 先进得多 发达得多
but we are hopelessly, hilariously, outgunned.

3086
01:08:27.810 --> 01:08:30.060
我们的人对你们的星球没有任何恶意
My people want nothing but peace with your planet.

3087
01:08:30.190 --> 01:08:32.150
但宇宙中并非只有你们
But you're not the only people out there, are you?

3088
01:08:32.270 --> 01:08:34.230
你也不是唯一的威胁
And you're not the only threat.

3089
01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:37.530
这个世界上有很多找不到对手的人
The world's filling up with people who can't be matched,

3090
01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:39.410
他们也不会被人控制
that can't be controlled.

3091
01:08:39.530 --> 01:08:40.660
就像你控制魔方那样
Like you controlled the Cube?

3092
01:08:40.780 --> 01:08:42.030
正是你对魔方的开发
Your work with the Tesseract

3093
01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:44.750
才引来了洛基和他的盟友
is what drew Loki to it, and his allies.

3094
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:46.250
对别的星球来说
It is a signal to all the realms

3095
01:08:46.370 --> 01:08:49.040
这是你们地球人做好高级战争准备的一个信号
that the Earth is ready for a higher form of war.

3096
01:08:49.170 --> 01:08:50.250
高级战争
A higher form?

3097
01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:51.380
你们逼我们出手
You forced our hand.

3098
01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:52.500
我们得有应急
We had to come up with something.

3099
01:08:52.630 --> 01:08:53.630
比如核威慑
A nuclear deterrent.

3100
01:08:53.750 --> 01:08:55.760
这招能让所有事都冷静下来
Because that always calms everything right down.

3101
01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:58.260
你倒是说说你是怎么发家致富的 史塔克
Remind me again how you made your fortune, Stark.

3102
01:08:58.380 --> 01:09:00.760
如果他还在制造武器 他肯定已经被埋在
I'm sure if he still made weapons, Stark would be neck-deep...

3103
01:09:00.890 --> 01:09:02.510
等等 怎么矛头又对准我了
Hold on. How is this now about me?

3104
01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:03.760
难道不是一直对你吗
I'm sorry, isn't everything?

3105
01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:05.770
我还以为地球人能更开化一点呢
I thought humans were more evolved than this.

3106
01:09:05.890 --> 01:09:08.770
我们可没到你的星球上去胡作非为
Excuse me, did we come to your planet and blow stuff up?

3107
01:09:08.890 --> 01:09:10.770
你们对自己的队友这么没有信心
You treat your champions with such mistrust.

3108
01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:12.360
你们这些人这么幼稚
Are you boys really that naive?

3109
01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:14.360
神盾局只是在监视潜在威胁
S.H.I.E.L.D. monitors potential threats.

3110
01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:15.780
原来美国队长也是潜在威胁
Captain America's on threat watch?

3111
01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:17.070
我们都是
We all are.

3112
01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:18.520
等等 你在也名单上
Wait, you're on that list?

3113
01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:20.110
你排在愤怒的蜜蜂之前还是之后
Are you above or below angry bees?

3114
01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:22.370
史塔克 听着 如果你的嘴再犯贱
Stark, so help me God, if you make one more wisecrack...

3115
01:09:22.490 --> 01:09:23.740
恐吓 赤裸裸的恐吓 我受到了威胁
Threat! Verbal threat. I feel threatened.

3116
01:09:23.870 --> 01:09:26.370
- 请你放尊重些  - 尊重什么
- Show some respect. - Respect what?

3117
01:09:33.710 --> 01:09:36.630
66B号运输船 电脑上有你的资料
Transport Six-Six-Bravo, please relay confirm codes.

3118
01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:38.920
但没有你的航行记录
I've got you on the computer, but not on the day log.

3119
01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:41.140
你运的是什么货物 完毕
What is your haul? Over.

3120
01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:43.890
武器和弹药 完毕
Arms and ammunition. Over.

3121
01:09:52.230 --> 01:09:54.440
你说要秩序 现在还不是一团糟
You speak of control, yet you court chaos.

3122
01:09:54.570 --> 01:09:56.280
这是他的管理方法
That's his M.O., isn't it?

3123
01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:57.650
我们算什么 一个团队
I mean, what are we, a team?

3124
01:09:57.780 --> 01:10:00.740
不 不 我们混在一起 只会制造混乱
No, we're a chemical mixture that makes chaos.

3125
01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:02.820
就像 定时炸弹一样
We're a time bomb.

3126
01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:04.780
你 应该冷静一下
You need to step away.

3127
01:10:04.910 --> 01:10:06.740
男人为什么不能适当发泄一下
Why shouldn't the guy let off a little steam?

3128
01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:09.000
你唯恐天下不乱吗  走开
You know damn well why. Back off!

3129
01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:11.330
我看你怎么让我走开
I'm starting to want you to make me.

3130
01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:15.090
是啊 躲在护甲里逞英雄
Yeah. Big man in a suit of armour.

3131
01:10:15.210 --> 01:10:16.670
没有护甲 你算什么
Take that off, what are you?

3132
01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:19.130
算天才 百万富翁 花花公子 慈善家
Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.

3133
01:10:20.010 --> 01:10:23.180
很多什么都不是的人 比你强十倍
I know guys with none of that worth ten of you.

3134
01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:24.300
我见得多了
I've seen the footage.

3135
01:10:24.430 --> 01:10:26.680
你只会为自己拚命
The only thing you really fight for is yourself.

3136
01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:30.060
你绝对不是那种能自我牺牲的人
You're not the guy to make the sacrifice play,

3137
01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:32.690
趴在铁丝网上 让战友们从身上过去
to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you.

3138
01:10:32.810 --> 01:10:34.940
我认为应该剪断铁丝网
I think I would just cut the wire.

3139
01:10:37.570 --> 01:10:39.780
你总有歪点子
Always a way out.

3140
01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:41.150
也许你还算不上威胁
You may not be a threat

3141
01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:43.200
但你最好不要把自己当成个英雄
but you better stop pretending to be a hero.

3142
01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:45.780
英雄 像你一样
A hero? Like you?

3143
01:10:45.910 --> 01:10:47.950
你不过是个实验品 罗杰斯
You're a laboratory experiment, Rogers.

3144
01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:51.710
你所有的能力 都来自一个小瓶子
Everything special about you came out of a bottle.

3145
01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:19.820
穿上你的护甲 我们单挑
Put on the suit. Let's go a few rounds.

3146
01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:24.280
你们这些人可真小气 太小气
You people are so petty and tiny.

3147
01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:25.410
对 这就是团队
Yeah, this is a team.

3148
01:11:25.530 --> 01:11:28.030
罗曼诺夫特工 请你带班纳博士去他的
Agent Romanoff, would you escort Dr Banner back to his...

3149
01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:29.830
我的房间  你不是借给洛基了吗
Where? You rented my room.

3150
01:11:29.950 --> 01:11:31.410
那是为了以防万一
The cell was just in case...

3151
01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:33.080
是万一你需要干掉我吧
In case you needed to kill me.

3152
01:11:33.210 --> 01:11:36.120
那不可能 我知道 我试过
But you can't. I know, I tried.

3153
01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:41.760
我失望过  因为我看不到未来
I got low. I didn't see an end.

3154
01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:46.340
所以我对着自己开了一枪 但另一个我把子弹吐了出来
So, I put a bullet in my mouth, and the other guy spit it out.

3155
01:11:46.930 --> 01:11:48.140
凑合着活
So I moved on.

3156
01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:51.100
我尝试着去帮助别人 我做得不错
I focused on helping other people. I was good.

3157
01:11:51.220 --> 01:11:53.430
直到你把我拉进这个怪胎秀
Until you dragged me back into this freak show

3158
01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:54.940
让所有人都身处险境
and put everyone here at risk.

3159
01:11:55.060 --> 01:11:57.150
你想知道我的秘密吗
You want to know my secret, Agent Romanoff?

3160
01:11:57.270 --> 01:11:59.110
你想知道我是如何保持平静的吗
You want to know how I stay calm?

3161
01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:04.070
班纳博士
Dr Banner,

3162
01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:06.200
把那东西放下
put down the sceptre.

3163
01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:12.200
伽马射线定位

3164
01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:11.700
搜索...

3165
01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:12.200
伽马射线符合度

3166
01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:16.120
找到了
Got it.

3167
01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:17.960
抱歉 伙计们
Sorry, kids,

3168
01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:19.840
我的拿手好戏派不上用场
you don't get to see my party trick after all.

3169
01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:20.960
你定位到魔方了
You located the Tesseract?

3170
01:12:21.090 --> 01:12:22.090
我可以先过去
I could get there fastest.

3171
01:12:22.210 --> 01:12:24.340
宇宙魔方属于神域 人类无法控制它
The Tesseract belongs on Asgard. No human is a match for it.

3172
01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:25.800
- 你不能一个人去 - 你想阻止我
- You're not going alone. - You're gonna stop me?

3173
01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:26.930
穿上护甲 小心点
Put on the suit, let's find out.

3174
01:12:27.050 --> 01:12:28.340
再不济也比老家伙强
I'm not afraid to hit an old man.

3175
01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:29.470
想试试吗
Put on the suit.

3176
01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:32.200
伽马射线定位

3177
01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:32.200
伽马射线符合度

3178
01:12:32.350 --> 01:12:33.970
哦 天呐
Oh, my God.

3179
01:12:49.490 --> 01:12:50.490
快穿上护甲
Put on the suit.

3180
01:12:50.620 --> 01:12:51.910
好的
Yeah.

3181
01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:56.410
赶快拿武器
All hands to stations.

3182
01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:02.340
- 希尔 - 外部发生爆炸
- Hill! - External detonation.

3183
01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:03.710
三号引擎停止运行了
Number three engine is down.

3184
01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:04.840
我们被击中了
We've been hit.

3185
01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:06.130
- 引擎能修复吗  - 三号引擎起火
- Can they get it running? - Fire in engine three!

3186
01:13:06.260 --> 01:13:07.260
回答我
Talk to me.

3187
01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:09.010
涡轮基本上没事
Turbine looks mostly intact

3188
01:13:09.130 --> 01:13:11.010
但只要我们还在飞行
but it's impossible to get out there to make repairs

3189
01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:12.550
就不可能派人出去进行修补
while we're in the air.

3190
01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:15.220
再失去一个引擎就完蛋了
If we lose one more engine, we won't be.

3191
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:17.310
必须得有人出去修理引擎
Somebody's got to get outside and patch that engine.

3192
01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:18.310
史塔克 听到了吗
Stark, you copy that?

3193
01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:19.310
我去修
I'm on it.

3194
01:13:19.310 --> 01:13:22.610
科尔森 打开封闭区的防御封锁
Coulson, initiate defensive lockdown in the detention section

3195
01:13:22.730 --> 01:13:23.730
然后去军械库
then get to the armoury.

3196
01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:24.980
罗曼诺夫
Romanoff?

3197
01:13:28.610 --> 01:13:30.070
我没事
We're okay.

3198
01:13:32.660 --> 01:13:33.910
大家都没事吧
We're okay, right?

3199
01:13:46.510 --> 01:13:47.710
- 不能让他们修复引擎   - 是 长官
- Keep that engine down!  - Yes, sir.

3200
01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:49.550
去封闭区等摄像头关闭
Detention, wait for cameras to go dark.

3201
01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:50.800
- 是  - 跟着我
- Got it. - Stay close.

3202
01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:54.720
我们走 去第4层
Let's go, Level 4.

3203
01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:58.480
三号引擎 在那儿碰头
Engine three. I'll meet you there.

3204
01:14:06.650 --> 01:14:07.820
博士
Doctor?

3205
01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:11.200
班纳
Bruce?

3206
01:14:11.490 --> 01:14:15.160
你要坚持 不然正中洛基下怀
You got to fight it. This is just what Loki wants.

3207
01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:17.580
我们会没事的
We're going to be okay. Listen to me.

3208
01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:18.700
你受伤了吗
Are you hurt?

3209
01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.210
我们会没事的
We're going to be okay. All right?

3210
01:14:24.330 --> 01:14:27.090
听着 我用我的生命担保 一定会把你带出去
I swear on my life, I will get you out of this.

3211
01:14:27.210 --> 01:14:28.590
你可以躲得远远的
You will walk away and never ever...

3212
01:14:28.710 --> 01:14:30.800
你的生命
Your life?

3213
01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:48.320
班纳
Bruce.

3214
01:15:25.190 --> 01:15:28.360
把航母飞回到座标180 向南前进
Bring the carrier about to a 1-8-0, heading south!

3215
01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:29.480
回到水面去
Take us to the water!

3216
01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:30.480
我们在盲目飞行 长官
We're flying blind.

3217
01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:32.490
导航系统在重新校准
Navigation's recalibrating after the engine failure.

3218
01:15:32.610 --> 01:15:34.360
太阳升起来了吗
Is the sun coming up?

3219
01:15:35.110 --> 01:15:36.120
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

3220
01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:37.320
那就看着太阳找方向
Then put it on the left.

3221
01:15:37.450 --> 01:15:39.120
把我们带到海面上空
Get us over water.

3222
01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:41.330
再有一个涡轮损毁 我们就会掉下去
One more turbine goes down, and we drop.

3223
01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:44.870
谢谢
Thanks.

3224
01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:49.380
史塔克
Stark!

3225
01:15:52.090 --> 01:15:53.760
史塔克 我在这儿
Stark, I'm here!

3226
01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:55.380
好的
Good.

3227
01:15:56.590 --> 01:15:58.600
我看到你了
Let's see what we've got.

3228
01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:00.390
我要让这个超导制冷系统
I got to get this superconducting coolant system

3229
01:16:00.510 --> 01:16:01.520
重新运转起来
back online

3230
01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:03.100
在我开始工作前
before I can access the rotors,

3231
01:16:03.230 --> 01:16:05.060
你先清理那些障碍物
work on dislodging the debris.

3232
01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:09.150
我需要你到引擎控制箱那儿
I need you to get to that engine control panel

3233
01:16:09.270 --> 01:16:12.940
然后告诉我哪些开关处于过载状态
and tell me which relays are in overload position.

3234
01:16:25.250 --> 01:16:26.790
情况怎么样
What does it look like in there?

3235
01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:30.040
看起来这里只是一堆电路板
It seems to run on some form of electricity.

3236
01:16:30.170 --> 01:16:31.920
哦 很专业
Well, you're not wrong.

3237
01:17:35.730 --> 01:17:38.570
我们不是你的敌人 班纳
We are not your enemies, Banner.

3238
01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:39.700
你冷静点
Try to think!

3239
01:17:49.830 --> 01:17:51.710
好了 这些开关都正常了
Okay, the relays are intact.

3240
01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:53.290
接下来呢
What's our next move?

3241
01:17:53.420 --> 01:17:54.420
即使我搞定了那些齿轮
Even if I clear the rotors,

3242
01:17:54.550 --> 01:17:56.760
这东西没有助推也启动不了
this thing won't re-engage without a jump.

3243
01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:58.260
我得到里面去推一把
I'm going to have to get in there and push.

3244
01:17:58.380 --> 01:18:00.130
启动加速 你会被撕成碎片
If that thing gets up to speed, you'll get shredded.

3245
01:18:00.260 --> 01:18:02.260
那个控制定子的单元 可以反转磁极
That stator control unit can reverse the polarity

3246
01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:03.800
就会有足够长的时间脱离磁悬浮 并且
long enough to disengage maglev and that could...

3247
01:18:03.930 --> 01:18:05.260
说点我能听懂的
Speak English!

3248
01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:07.720
看到那个红色扳手了吗
You see that red lever?

3249
01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:11.150
它能降低转速 这样我就有时间了
It will slow the rotors down long enough for me to get out.

3250
01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:13.060
你守在那儿 等我的指令
Stand by it. Wait for my word.

3251
01:19:05.660 --> 01:19:07.450
传我的命令 全体人员撤离
We need full evac on the lower hangar bay.

3252
01:19:10.660 --> 01:19:11.710
手榴弹
Grenade!

3253
01:19:26.850 --> 01:19:28.180
有敌人侵入
We've got a perimeter breach!

3254
01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:30.350
有敌人闯入神盾局设施
Hostiles are in S.H.I.E.L.D. gear.

3255
01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:32.560
所有人员各就各位
Call-outs at every junction.

3256
01:19:39.860 --> 01:19:42.070
浩克和索尔在第4层研发室
We have the Hulk and Thor on Research Level 4.

3257
01:19:42.190 --> 01:19:43.740
第2层和第3层的监视器坏了
Levels 2 and 3 are dark.

3258
01:19:43.860 --> 01:19:45.990
浩克会把这地方全毁了 长官
Sir, the Hulk will tear this place apart!

3259
01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:48.200
转移他的注意力
Get his attention.

3260
01:19:48.330 --> 01:19:52.500
护航60前往实验室 迎战攻击性目标
Escort 6-0, proceed to Wishbone and engage hostile.

3261
01:19:52.620 --> 01:19:53.910
别靠得太近
Don't get too close.

3262
01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:55.420
收到
Copy.

3263
01:20:07.340 --> 01:20:08.720
发现目标
Target acquired.

3264
01:20:13.020 --> 01:20:14.020
目标锁定
Target engaged.

3265
01:20:25.650 --> 01:20:27.200
目标疯了 目标疯了
Target angry, target angry!

3266
01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:37.810
他们从没来过这边 打什么鬼主意
They're not getting through here, so what the hell...

3267
01:21:51.780 --> 01:21:52.570
故障警报

3268
01:21:52.570 --> 01:21:52.770
故障警报

3269
01:21:52.770 --> 01:21:52.970
故障警报

3270
01:21:52.970 --> 01:21:53.170
故障警报

3271
01:21:53.170 --> 01:21:53.570
故障警报

3272
01:21:52.580 --> 01:21:53.570
1号引擎损毁

3273
01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:58.460
一号引擎被关闭了
Engine one is now in shut-down.

3274
01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:09.050
我们正在失控下落状态 我们在下坠
We are in an uncontrolled descent.

3275
01:22:09.170 --> 01:22:11.050
长官 我们已经完全失去一号引擎的动力
Sir, we've lost all power in engine one.

3276
01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:13.430
巴顿把我们的系统毁了
It's Barton. He took out our systems.

3277
01:22:13.550 --> 01:22:16.060
他往封闭区去了
He's headed for the detention level.

3278
01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:18.140
有人听到吗
Does anybody copy?

3279
01:22:19.310 --> 01:22:21.440
我是罗曼诺夫
This is Agent Romanoff.

3280
01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:23.020
我听到了
I copy.

3281
01:22:27.650 --> 01:22:28.650
史塔克 我们在下坠
Stark, we're losing altitude.

3282
01:22:28.780 --> 01:22:30.240
是啊 我注意到了
Yeah, I noticed.

3283
01:22:59.270 --> 01:23:00.310
不
No!

3284
01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:10.610
这招对你真是屡试不爽
Are you ever not going to fall for that?

3285
01:23:53.610 --> 01:23:55.860
地球人觉得我们是不朽的神
The humans think us immortal.

3286
01:23:56.950 --> 01:23:58.490
要不要试试看
Should we test that?

3287
01:24:01.290 --> 01:24:02.500
请让开一下
Move away, please.

3288
01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:08.460
喜欢这个吗
You like this?

3289
01:24:09.420 --> 01:24:12.670
在你把毁灭者送来后 我们就开始研制这个了
We started working on the prototype after you sent the Destroyer.

3290
01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:16.140
我不知道它能干什么
Even I don't know what it does.

3291
01:24:16.930 --> 01:24:18.180
想见识一下
Do you want to find out?

3292
01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:21.640
不
No!

3293
01:25:31.170 --> 01:25:32.590
娜塔莎
Natasha?

3294
01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:05.910
你输定了
You're going to lose.

3295
01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:09.160
我输了
Am I?

3296
01:26:10.460 --> 01:26:12.960
是命中注定的
It's in your nature.

3297
01:26:15.130 --> 01:26:17.460
你们的英雄四分五裂
Your heroes are scattered.

3298
01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:21.300
你们的堡垒 就要从空中掉下去了
Your floating fortress falls from the sky.

3299
01:26:21.430 --> 01:26:23.050
我还需要担心什么呢
Where is my disadvantage?

3300
01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:25.810
你这个人没有信念
You lack conviction.

3301
01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:27.640
可我不觉得
I don't think I'm...

3302
01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:36.190
原来是干这个用的
So, that's what it does.

3303
01:26:38.100 --> 01:26:40.100
压力不稳定

3304
01:26:38.100 --> 01:26:40.100
警报

3305
01:26:38.100 --> 01:26:40.100
高度

3306
01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:41.450
全体人员 立刻做好坠落冲击准备
All hands to crash stations immediately.

3307
01:27:09.020 --> 01:27:10.020
队长 扳动扳手
Cap, hit the lever.

3308
01:27:10.390 --> 01:27:12.980
稍等一下
I need a minute here!

3309
01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:14.190
扳手
Lever

3310
01:27:14.310 --> 01:27:15.440
快
now!

3311
01:27:27.410 --> 01:27:28.540
救命
Help!

3312
01:28:04.150 --> 01:28:05.530
对不起 头儿
Sorry, boss.

3313
01:28:05.660 --> 01:28:07.370
让那瘟神溜了
The god rabbited.

3314
01:28:07.490 --> 01:28:08.950
保持清醒
Just stay awake.

3315
01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:10.700
没事 看着我
Eyes on me.

3316
01:28:10.830 --> 01:28:12.370
不 我该歇歇了
No, I'm clocking out here.

3317
01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:14.000
你不能歇
Not an option.

3318
01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:16.960
我没事 头儿
It's okay, boss.

3319
01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:20.920
不给他们点动力
This was never gonna work

3320
01:28:21.050 --> 01:28:22.340
他们就永远不会
if they didn't have something

3321
01:28:23.670 --> 01:28:25.220
团结
to...

3322
01:28:54.330 --> 01:28:56.170
科尔森特工阵亡了
Agent Coulson is down.

3323
01:28:57.540 --> 01:28:59.250
医疗小队已经赶过去了
A medical team is on its way to your location.

3324
01:28:59.380 --> 01:29:00.840
他们在这儿
They're here.

3325
01:29:04.050 --> 01:29:05.670
没用了
They called it.

3326
01:29:22.150 --> 01:29:23.780
这是在科尔森特工的外套里发现的
These were in Phil Coulson's jacket.

3327
01:29:27.110 --> 01:29:29.240
他永远都没有机会找你签名了
I guess he never did get you to sign them.

3328
01:29:32.740 --> 01:29:34.410
我们处于盲目的状态
We're dead in the air up here.

3329
01:29:34.540 --> 01:29:37.620
通讯坏了 无法找到魔方
Our communications, the location of the Cube,

3330
01:29:37.750 --> 01:29:40.170
班纳 索尔 也都不见了
Banner, Thor...

3331
01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:43.380
我也无能为力
I got nothing for you.

3332
01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:46.420
我失去了最优秀的心腹
I lost my one good eye.

3333
01:29:49.470 --> 01:29:52.470
也许我自作自受
Maybe I had that coming.

3334
01:29:56.680 --> 01:29:57.980
没错
Yes,

3335
01:29:59.140 --> 01:30:02.480
我们原本是打算用魔方制造武器的
we were going to build an arsenal with the Tesseract.

3336
01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:07.480
无聊老生制作

3337
01:30:03.940 --> 01:30:05.860
但是我 没有把赌注下到这上面
I never put all my chips on that number, though

3338
01:30:05.980 --> 01:30:09.030
而是用在了某个更风险的项目上
because I was playing something even riskier.

3339
01:30:12.990 --> 01:30:17.120
那是我的理想 史塔克应该知道
There was an idea, Stark knows this,

3340
01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:22.330
我们称作 复仇者方案
called the Avengers Initiative.

3341
01:30:23.540 --> 01:30:25.670
这个想法就是把世界上最卓越的人
The idea was to bring together a group

3342
01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:28.340
都聚在一起
of remarkable people

3343
01:30:29.130 --> 01:30:31.970
看他们是否能发挥更大的作用
to see if they could become something more.

3344
01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:37.520
在我们最需要他们的时候 他们能够齐心协力
To see if they could work together when we needed them to,

3345
01:30:37.640 --> 01:30:40.980
一起对抗我们没把握打败的敌人
to fight the battles that we never could.

3346
01:30:43.730 --> 01:30:48.570
科尔森至死都坚信这个理想 他相信
Phil Coulson died still believing in that idea.

3347
01:30:50.900 --> 01:30:52.570
英雄的存在
In heroes.

3348
01:31:00.660 --> 01:31:02.210
好吧
Well,

3349
01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:05.750
这是个有些老套的概念
it's an old-fashioned notion.

3350
01:31:26.060 --> 01:31:28.570
你从天上掉了下来
You fell out of the sky.

3351
01:31:42.580 --> 01:31:44.080
我伤到什么人了吗
Did I hurt anybody?

3352
01:31:44.210 --> 01:31:47.250
这儿没什么人能让你伤的
There's nobody around here to get hurt.

3353
01:31:47.380 --> 01:31:50.670
倒是让你吓坏了不少鸽子
You did scare the hell out of some pigeons, though.

3354
01:31:51.510 --> 01:31:52.550
太好了
Lucky.

3355
01:31:52.670 --> 01:31:54.300
你运气真好
Or just good aim.

3356
01:31:54.430 --> 01:31:56.010
掉下来的时候还醒着
You were awake when you fell.

3357
01:31:58.100 --> 01:31:59.140
你看到了
You saw?

3358
01:31:59.140 --> 01:32:00.140
全过程
The whole thing.

3359
01:32:00.270 --> 01:32:01.890
砸穿天花板掉下来
Right through the ceiling.

3360
01:32:02.020 --> 01:32:05.980
光着屁股的绿色大块头
Big and green and buck-ass nude.

3361
01:32:06.100 --> 01:32:07.230
给你
Here.

3362
01:32:08.610 --> 01:32:10.780
我估摸着等你恢复正常尺寸后
Didn't think those would fit you until you shrunk down

3363
01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:13.320
就能穿下这个了
to a regular-size feller.

3364
01:32:15.660 --> 01:32:16.950
谢谢了
Thank you.

3365
01:32:17.950 --> 01:32:19.200
你是外星人
Are you an alien?

3366
01:32:19.790 --> 01:32:20.990
什么
What?

3367
01:32:21.290 --> 01:32:22.620
外太空的外星人
From outer space, an alien.

3368
01:32:23.250 --> 01:32:24.250
不是
No.

3369
01:32:24.620 --> 01:32:27.750
那么 年轻人 你病得可不轻
Well, then, son, you've got a condition.

3370
01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:40.930
巴顿 你肯定会没事的
Clint. You're going to be all right.

3371
01:32:44.270 --> 01:32:46.350
你怎么知道
You know that?

3372
01:32:47.190 --> 01:32:49.060
我没时间了
Is that what you know?

3373
01:32:51.530 --> 01:32:54.400
我得把它
I've got no window.

3374
01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:56.570
从我大脑里赶出去
I have to flush him out.

3375
01:32:57.490 --> 01:32:59.320
你需要花点时间才能恢复正常
You got to level out. It's going to take time.

3376
01:32:59.450 --> 01:33:00.990
你不会明白的
You don't understand.

3377
01:33:02.950 --> 01:33:06.210
你从来没让别人控制过你的大脑
Have you ever had someone take your brain and play?

3378
01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:11.170
把真正的你挤跑 塞进别的东西进去
Pull you out and stuff something else in?

3379
01:33:14.340 --> 01:33:16.720
你知道被摧垮是什么感觉吗
Do you know what it's like to be unmade?

3380
01:33:18.260 --> 01:33:20.640
你知道我也经历过
You know that I do.

3381
01:33:28.230 --> 01:33:29.270
我怎么醒的
Why am I back?

3382
01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:31.770
你怎么赶走它的
How did you get him out?

3383
01:33:31.900 --> 01:33:34.740
重新校准意识
Cognitive recalibration.

3384
01:33:34.860 --> 01:33:37.570
我狠敲了你的脑袋
I hit you really hard on the head.

3385
01:33:37.700 --> 01:33:38.780
谢谢
Thanks.

3386
01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:44.830
娜塔莎
Natasha...

3387
01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:46.580
有多少特工被我
How many agents did I...

3388
01:33:46.710 --> 01:33:48.170
别去想了
Don't.

3389
01:33:48.290 --> 01:33:50.500
不要增加自己的负罪感
Don't do that to yourself, Clint.

3390
01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:52.800
都是洛基干的
This is Loki.

3391
01:33:52.920 --> 01:33:55.550
他们是  妖魔鬼怪
This is monsters and magic,

3392
01:33:55.670 --> 01:33:57.300
我们没有经受过这方面的训练
and nothing we were ever trained for.

3393
01:33:57.420 --> 01:33:58.970
洛基 他逃走了
Loki, did he get away?

3394
01:33:59.090 --> 01:34:00.090
是的
Yeah.

3395
01:34:00.430 --> 01:34:02.680
你应该知道他去哪儿
I don't suppose you know where.

3396
01:34:02.810 --> 01:34:04.600
他从不告诉我
I didn't need to know.

3397
01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:06.480
我也不问
I didn't ask.

3398
01:34:09.730 --> 01:34:12.230
他应该很快实施他的计划
He's going to make his play soon, though.

3399
01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:13.570
在今天
Today.

3400
01:34:13.690 --> 01:34:15.030
我们需要阻止他
We got to stop him.

3401
01:34:15.690 --> 01:34:16.940
我们 还有谁
Yeah? Who's "we"?

3402
01:34:17.070 --> 01:34:19.030
不知道 剩下的人吧
I don't know. Whoever's left.

3403
01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:21.570
好吧
Well,

3404
01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:25.450
如果我能 往洛基的眼睛里射一箭
if I put an arrow through Loki's eye socket,

3405
01:34:25.580 --> 01:34:28.290
我会睡得香一点
I would sleep better, I suppose.

3406
01:34:31.130 --> 01:34:32.710
你终于正常了
Now you sound like you.

3407
01:34:33.420 --> 01:34:34.880
可你不正常
But you don't.

3408
01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:39.630
你是间谍 不是战士
You're a spy, not a soldier.

3409
01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:44.510
过去你不是这样 现在你想上前线 为什么
Now you want to wade into a war. Why?

3410
01:34:46.270 --> 01:34:48.230
洛基怎么你了
What did Loki do to you?

3411
01:34:48.980 --> 01:34:51.400
他怎么我 只是
He didn't. I just...

3412
01:34:55.150 --> 01:34:56.690
娜塔莎
Natasha.

3413
01:34:58.780 --> 01:35:00.780
我有点动摇了
I've been compromised.

3414
01:35:03.870 --> 01:35:05.990
我欠的血债太多
I got red in my ledger.

3415
01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:10.210
我想还债
I would like to wipe it out.

3416
01:35:26.220 --> 01:35:27.720
他结婚了
Was he married?

3417
01:35:27.850 --> 01:35:29.270
没有
No.

3418
01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:33.600
他有个 拉大提琴的女朋友
There was a cellist, I think.

3419
01:35:35.190 --> 01:35:36.610
我很难过
I'm sorry.

3420
01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:38.980
他看起来人很好
He seemed like a good man.

3421
01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:41.360
他太傻了
He was an idiot.

3422
01:35:41.490 --> 01:35:43.740
为什么 为了信念
Why? For believing?

3423
01:35:43.860 --> 01:35:45.280
他一个人去对付洛基
For taking on Loki alone.

3424
01:35:45.410 --> 01:35:47.120
他是尽守职责
He was doing his job.

3425
01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:49.790
超出了他的能力范围 他应该等待援军
He was out of his league. He should have waited.

3426
01:35:49.910 --> 01:35:50.950
他应该
He should have...

3427
01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:52.660
有时候 你会不由自主的
Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony.

3428
01:35:52.790 --> 01:35:54.920
这话 我以前也听过
Right, I've heard that before.

3429
01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:56.540
你第一次看到战士阵亡吗
Is this the first time you lost a soldier?

3430
01:35:56.670 --> 01:35:58.460
可我们不是战士
We are not soldiers.

3431
01:36:02.930 --> 01:36:04.680
我没打算听弗瑞摆布
I'm not marching to Fury's fife.

3432
01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:05.970
我也是
Neither am I.

3433
01:36:06.090 --> 01:36:08.310
他和洛基都要为科尔森的死负责
He's got the same blood on his hands that Loki does.

3434
01:36:08.430 --> 01:36:12.140
但是现在我们必须要以大局为重
But right now, we got to put that behind us and get this done.

3435
01:36:12.270 --> 01:36:13.270
洛基需要一个能量源
Loki needs a power source.

3436
01:36:13.390 --> 01:36:14.390
如果我们能
If we can put together a list...

3437
01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:15.520
他想张扬个性
He made it personal.

3438
01:36:15.690 --> 01:36:16.730
这无关紧要
That's not the point.

3439
01:36:16.860 --> 01:36:19.230
这很重要 这就是他的个性
That is the point. That's Loki's point.

3440
01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:21.280
他对我们的背景都了若指掌 为什么
He hit us all right where we live. Why?

3441
01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:22.400
让我们内讧
To tear us apart.

3442
01:36:22.530 --> 01:36:24.400
对 各个击破
Yeah, divide and conquer is great

3443
01:36:24.530 --> 01:36:26.990
太妙了 但他知道要想获胜的唯一办法
but he knows he has to take us out to win, right?

3444
01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:28.660
就得把我们都击败
That's what he wants.

3445
01:36:28.780 --> 01:36:31.290
想要打败我们 还想要别人来见证这一刻
He wants to beat us, he wants to be seen doing it.

3446
01:36:31.410 --> 01:36:32.540
他想要观众
He wants an audience.

3447
01:36:33.250 --> 01:36:34.920
没错 在斯图加特就是这样
Right. I caught his act in Stuttgart.

3448
01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:37.960
对 那个只是预告片 今天才是重头戏
Yeah, that was just previews. This is opening night.

3449
01:36:38.090 --> 01:36:40.630
洛基是个标准自大狂
And Loki, he's a full-tilt diva, right?

3450
01:36:40.750 --> 01:36:42.340
他想要鲜花 渴望掌声
He wants flowers, he wants parades.

3451
01:36:42.460 --> 01:36:46.260
想要个标志性建筑物 让他的名字能高高在上
He wants a monument built to the skies with his name plastered...

3452
01:36:48.010 --> 01:36:49.600
这个混蛋
Son of a bitch.

3453
01:37:00.860 --> 01:37:01.900
该走了
Time to go.

3454
01:37:02.030 --> 01:37:03.570
- 去哪儿  - 路上告诉你
- Go where? - I'll tell you on the way.

3455
01:37:03.690 --> 01:37:04.700
你会开飞机吗
Can you fly one of those jets?

3456
01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:07.530
我会
I can.

3457
01:37:11.410 --> 01:37:12.450
你有制服吗
You got a suit?

3458
01:37:12.580 --> 01:37:13.580
有
Yeah.

3459
01:37:13.700 --> 01:37:15.160
那就穿上
Then suit up.

3460
01:37:42.820 --> 01:37:44.110
嗨 你们几个不能到这儿来
Hey, you guys aren't authorised to be in here.

3461
01:37:44.230 --> 01:37:46.570
小伙子 对不起了
Son, just don't.

3462
01:37:48.610 --> 01:37:49.620
长官
Sir.

3463
01:37:49.740 --> 01:37:50.950
希尔特工
Agent Hill.

3464
01:37:51.490 --> 01:37:53.040
那些卡片
Those cards,

3465
01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:59.630
是放在科尔森的衣物柜里的 不在他的外套
they were in Coulson's locker, not in his jacket.

3466
01:38:04.050 --> 01:38:05.630
他们需要一些动力
They needed the push.

3467
01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:11.010
有人未经授权 从6号停机坪起飞了
We have an unauthorised departure from Bay 6.

3468
01:38:11.890 --> 01:38:13.220
找到洛基了
They found him.

3469
01:38:14.060 --> 01:38:17.770
不惜一切手段马上恢复通讯系统
Get our communications back up, whatever you have to do.

3470
01:38:17.890 --> 01:38:19.150
我要随时掌握情况
I want eyes on everything.

3471
01:38:19.150 --> 01:38:20.150
是 长官
Yes, sir.

3472
01:38:21.150 --> 01:38:24.150
美国 纽约
America New York

3473
01:38:33.700 --> 01:38:35.450
先生 我们关闭了方舟反应堆
Sir, I've turned off the arc reactor

3474
01:38:35.580 --> 01:38:39.410
但是魔方已经在持续供能了
but the device is already self-sustaining.

3475
01:38:39.540 --> 01:38:41.710
关上它 席尔维格博士
Shut it down, Dr Selvig.

3476
01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:43.670
太晚了
It's too late!

3477
01:38:45.710 --> 01:38:47.170
它已经停不下来了
She can't stop now.

3478
01:38:48.220 --> 01:38:50.680
它要向我们展示一个
She wants to show us something!

3479
01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:52.850
全新的宇宙
A new universe.

3480
01:38:52.970 --> 01:38:54.510
好吧
Okay.

3481
01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:03.440
那是纯能量构成的
The barrier is pure energy.

3482
01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:05.440
无法穿透
It's unbreachable.

3483
01:39:05.570 --> 01:39:07.360
对 我发现了
Yeah, I got that.

3484
01:39:08.570 --> 01:39:09.570
B计划
Plan B.

3485
01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:12.820
先生 马克7型还没做好实战准备
Sir, the Mark 7 is not ready for deployment.

3486
01:39:12.950 --> 01:39:15.200
那就别管它 我们时间紧迫
Then skip the spinning rims. We're on the clock.

3487
01:39:34.930 --> 01:39:37.970
你是来打算求我对你开恩的吧
Please tell me you're going to appeal to my humanity.

3488
01:39:39.100 --> 01:39:41.480
呃 其实 我是来要胁你的
Actually, I'm planning to threaten you.

3489
01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:43.060
那你至少应该穿着护甲
You should have left your armour on for that.

3490
01:39:43.190 --> 01:39:44.610
是啊
Yeah.

3491
01:39:44.730 --> 01:39:45.810
可惜不好用
It's seen a bit of mileage,

3492
01:39:45.940 --> 01:39:48.570
而且你还拿着那个 明晃晃的法杖
and you've got the glow stick of destiny.

3493
01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:51.650
喝一杯吗
Would you like a drink?

3494
01:39:51.780 --> 01:39:52.910
拖延我救不了你
Stalling me won't change anything.

3495
01:39:53.030 --> 01:39:55.160
不不 是威胁
No, no. Threatening.

3496
01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:56.660
你真不喝吗
No drink? Are you sure?

3497
01:39:56.780 --> 01:39:58.330
那我自己喝
I'm having one.

3498
01:39:59.370 --> 01:40:03.290
我的人马上就到 你们已经完蛋了
The Chitauri are coming. Nothing will change that.

3499
01:40:04.170 --> 01:40:05.580
我有什么好怕的
What have I to fear?

3500
01:40:05.710 --> 01:40:07.420
复仇者联盟
The Avengers.

3501
01:40:09.510 --> 01:40:11.840
我们这么称呼自己 算是个团队
That's what we call ourselves. We're sort of like a team.

3502
01:40:11.970 --> 01:40:13.590
世上最强英雄联盟
"Earth's mightiest heroes"-type thing.

3503
01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:15.590
对 我见识过
Yes, I've met them.

3504
01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:16.760
嗯
Yeah.

3505
01:40:16.890 --> 01:40:18.060
不过我们花了点时间才搞清楚
It takes us a while to get any traction, I'll give you that one.

3506
01:40:18.180 --> 01:40:21.520
让我给你清点一下人头
But let's do a head count, here.

3507
01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:24.140
你的兄弟 那个小帅哥
Your brother, the demigod,

3508
01:40:25.850 --> 01:40:29.440
超级英雄 一个不死的不负盛名的传奇
a super soldier, a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend.

3509
01:40:29.570 --> 01:40:32.740
一个脾气发作就要人命的大块头
A man with breathtaking anger-management issues,

3510
01:40:32.860 --> 01:40:35.950
还有一对精英杀手 而你呢 倒楣蛋
a couple of master assassins, and you, big fella,

3511
01:40:36.570 --> 01:40:39.540
你把他们每个人都惹毛了
you've managed to piss off every single one of them.

3512
01:40:39.660 --> 01:40:40.660
正是我的计划
That was the plan.

3513
01:40:40.790 --> 01:40:42.790
很烂的计划
Not a great plan.

3514
01:40:42.910 --> 01:40:44.960
他们来的时候
When they come,

3515
01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:46.540
他们肯定会来
and they will,

3516
01:40:46.670 --> 01:40:47.920
会来找你算账
they'll come for you.

3517
01:40:48.040 --> 01:40:49.040
我有支军队
I have an army.

3518
01:40:49.170 --> 01:40:50.340
我们有浩克
We have a Hulk.

3519
01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:52.210
我以为那怪物走丢了
I thought the beast had wandered off.

3520
01:40:52.340 --> 01:40:54.260
你还是没搞清楚状况
You're missing the point. There is no throne.

3521
01:40:54.380 --> 01:40:58.390
你永远坐不上王位 没有一种可能性会让你成功
There is no version of this where you come out on top.

3522
01:40:58.510 --> 01:41:00.850
也许你的军队会来 而且我们可能打不过
Maybe your army comes and maybe it's too much for us,

3523
01:41:00.970 --> 01:41:02.980
但我们都会来找你
but it's all on you.

3524
01:41:03.770 --> 01:41:04.850
如果地球失守了
Because if we can't protect the Earth,

3525
01:41:05.020 --> 01:41:08.150
我们肯定会来找你复仇
you can be damn well sure we'll avenge it.

3526
01:41:10.190 --> 01:41:13.240
如果你跟朋友们反目成仇
How will your friends have time for me

3527
01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:15.150
他们就没时间来找我了
when they are so busy fighting you?

3528
01:41:22.580 --> 01:41:23.620
我从没失误过
This usually works.

3529
01:41:23.750 --> 01:41:26.580
发挥失常很难免 好了 别那么自责
Well, performance issues, it's not uncommon.

3530
01:41:26.710 --> 01:41:28.630
谁还没
One out of five...

3531
01:41:30.090 --> 01:41:33.010
贾维斯 还等什么
Jarvis, anytime now.

3532
01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:37.510
你们都会 跪在我面前
You will all fall before me.

3533
01:41:37.630 --> 01:41:39.010
启动
Deploy!

3534
01:41:39.140 --> 01:41:40.550
快启动
Deploy!

3535
01:42:07.750 --> 01:42:10.710
你还得罪了另一个人
And there's one other person you pissed off.

3536
01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:13.090
科尔森特工
His name was Phil.

3537
01:42:36.860 --> 01:42:38.360
来吧
Right.

3538
01:42:38.490 --> 01:42:39.740
军队
Army.

3539
01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:53.400
洛基
Loki!

3540
01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:55.560
马上关闭魔方 不然我就毁了它
Turn off the Tesseract, or I'll destroy it.

3541
01:43:55.690 --> 01:43:56.730
你做不到的
You can't.

3542
01:43:56.860 --> 01:43:58.730
已经无法阻止它了
There is no stopping it.

3543
01:43:58.860 --> 01:44:00.650
现在只有
There is only

3544
01:44:00.780 --> 01:44:01.900
战争
the war.

3545
01:44:02.030 --> 01:44:03.160
那好吧
So be it.

3546
01:44:25.260 --> 01:44:27.010
史塔克 我们在你右侧
Stark, we're on your three, headed northeast.

3547
01:44:27.140 --> 01:44:29.260
你们是坐牛车来的吗
What? Did you stop for drive-through?

3548
01:44:29.390 --> 01:44:31.100
去帕克大街 我把他们引过去
Swing up Park. I'm going to lay them out for you.

3549
01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:50.490
先生 又来了很多
Sir, we have more incoming.

3550
01:44:50.620 --> 01:44:52.370
好 别让他们闲着
Fine. Let's keep them occupied.

3551
01:44:59.250 --> 01:45:01.130
- 娜塔莎  - 我看见了
- Nat? - I see him.

3552
01:45:45.470 --> 01:45:47.680
我们得到上面去
We got to get back up there.

3553
01:46:39.020 --> 01:46:40.690
史塔克 你看见了吗
Stark, are you seeing this?

3554
01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:43.900
看见了 但我还无法相信
Seeing. Still working on believing.

3555
01:46:44.020 --> 01:46:45.400
班纳在哪儿 他还没来吗
Where's Banner? Has he shown up yet?

3556
01:46:45.530 --> 01:46:46.570
班纳
Banner?

3557
01:46:46.690 --> 01:46:47.740
有消息立刻告诉我
Just keep me posted.

3558
01:46:48.450 --> 01:46:50.610
贾维斯 帮我找到它的弱点
Jarvis, find me a soft spot.

3559
01:46:52.870 --> 01:46:54.740
你看看这个
Look at this!

3560
01:46:54.870 --> 01:46:55.870
看看你周围
Look around you!

3561
01:46:56.870 --> 01:47:00.750
你以为这些会随着你的统治终结吗
You think this madness will end with your rule?

3562
01:47:00.870 --> 01:47:02.380
太晚了
It's too late.

3563
01:47:03.880 --> 01:47:05.130
要阻止它已经太晚了
It's too late to stop it.

3564
01:47:05.250 --> 01:47:09.130
不 我们一起 阻止它
No. We can, together.

3565
01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:17.850
多愁善感
Sentiment.

3566
01:47:45.420 --> 01:47:47.960
还有不少人被困在里面
We've got civilians still trapped up here.

3567
01:47:49.130 --> 01:47:50.130
洛基
Loki.

3568
01:48:01.770 --> 01:48:03.560
他们需要我们的帮助
They're fish in a barrel down there.

3569
01:48:09.030 --> 01:48:10.990
我们对付 你走
We got this. It's good. Go.

3570
01:48:11.110 --> 01:48:12.490
你们两个能挡住吗
Do you think you can hold them off?

3571
01:48:12.610 --> 01:48:13.610
队长
Captain,

3572
01:48:15.620 --> 01:48:18.450
我们是心甘情愿的
it would be my genuine pleasure.

3573
01:48:45.310 --> 01:48:47.020
这场面让我想起了布达佩斯
Just like Budapest all over again.

3574
01:48:47.650 --> 01:48:50.150
看来我们俩对布达佩斯的印象完全不同
You and I remember Budapest very differently.

3575
01:49:06.290 --> 01:49:08.710
长官 国民警卫队要一个小时才能到
It's going to be an hour before they can scramble the National Guard.

3576
01:49:08.840 --> 01:49:10.630
国民警卫队
National Guard?

3577
01:49:11.590 --> 01:49:13.090
军队知道这儿的情况吗
Does the army know what's happening here?

3578
01:49:13.340 --> 01:49:14.340
我怎么知道
Do we?

3579
01:49:15.550 --> 01:49:16.760
快去 在这些楼里布置人手
You need men in these buildings.

3580
01:49:16.890 --> 01:49:18.390
那里还有不少人
There are people inside and they're going to be running

3581
01:49:18.510 --> 01:49:19.720
他们的处境非常危险
right into the line of fire.

3582
01:49:19.850 --> 01:49:21.770
带他们从地下室 或者地铁撤离
You take them to the basements or through the subway.

3583
01:49:21.890 --> 01:49:23.480
不要让他们到街上来
You keep them off the streets.

3584
01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:26.230
我需要从这儿到39街 建立阵地
I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.

3585
01:49:26.350 --> 01:49:27.980
我干嘛要听你的指挥
Why the hell should I take orders from you?

3586
01:49:42.040 --> 01:49:43.250
挑几个人到楼里去
I need men in those buildings.

3587
01:49:43.370 --> 01:49:45.460
把里面的人都带到地下室 知道了
Lead the people down and away from the streets.

3588
01:49:45.580 --> 01:49:48.170
从这儿到39街 马上建立阵地
We're going to set up a perimeter all the way down to 39th Street.

3589
01:49:58.550 --> 01:50:00.140
好了 引起它的注意了
Well, we got its attention.

3590
01:50:00.260 --> 01:50:02.140
下一步该怎么办
What the hell was step two?

3591
01:50:31.670 --> 01:50:32.670
上面什么情况
What's the story upstairs?

3592
01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:34.710
无法穿透魔方周围的能量
The power surrounding the Cube is impenetrable.

3593
01:50:34.840 --> 01:50:37.470
他说得对 得先对付这些家伙
Thor's right. We got to deal with these guys.

3594
01:50:37.590 --> 01:50:39.220
- 我们该怎么做  - 团队合作
- How do we do this? - As a team.

3595
01:50:39.340 --> 01:50:40.640
我和洛基还有账没算完
I have unfinished business with Loki.

3596
01:50:41.180 --> 01:50:42.220
是吗  那你得排队
Yeah? Well, get in line.

3597
01:50:42.350 --> 01:50:43.350
好了
Save it.

3598
01:50:43.470 --> 01:50:44.810
洛基肯定会集中他的所有兵力
Loki's going to keep this fight focused on us,

3599
01:50:44.930 --> 01:50:45.970
来对付我们
and that's what we need.

3600
01:50:46.100 --> 01:50:47.770
除掉他 他们就会乱套
Without him, these things could run wild.

3601
01:50:47.890 --> 01:50:50.850
史塔克在天上 他会需要我们
We got Stark up top. He's going to need us to...

3602
01:50:58.200 --> 01:51:01.990
啊 看起来情况 很糟糕
So, this all seems horrible.

3603
01:51:02.450 --> 01:51:03.580
我见过更糟的
I've seen worse.

3604
01:51:04.120 --> 01:51:05.120
对不起
Sorry.

3605
01:51:05.240 --> 01:51:07.910
没关系 我们现在 需要更糟的
No, we could use a little worse.

3606
01:51:08.040 --> 01:51:09.460
史塔克 我们找到他了
Stark, we got him.

3607
01:51:09.460 --> 01:51:10.460
班纳
Banner?

3608
01:51:10.580 --> 01:51:11.830
没错 是他
Just like you said.

3609
01:51:11.960 --> 01:51:14.670
叫他做好准备 狂欢就要开始了
Then tell him to suit up. I'm bringing the party to you.

3610
01:51:21.140 --> 01:51:23.220
我 我不觉得这值得狂欢
I don't see how that's a party.

3611
01:51:31.060 --> 01:51:32.060
班纳博士
Dr Banner.

3612
01:51:33.810 --> 01:51:35.610
现在可是你应该发怒的好时候了
Now might be a really good time for you to get angry.

3613
01:51:36.650 --> 01:51:39.110
告诉你个秘密 队长
That's my secret, Captain.

3614
01:51:40.820 --> 01:51:42.070
我一直很愤怒
I'm always angry.

3615
01:51:53.540 --> 01:51:55.170
坚持住
Hold on!

3616
01:52:25.070 --> 01:52:26.620
全体出动
Send the rest.

3617
01:52:33.370 --> 01:52:34.630
各位
Guys.

3618
01:52:34.750 --> 01:52:35.960
下令吧 队长
Call it, Captain.

3619
01:52:36.080 --> 01:52:37.250
都听好了
All right, listen up.

3620
01:52:37.380 --> 01:52:40.170
在关闭传送门前 先牵制住他们
Until we can close that portal, our priority is containment.

3621
01:52:40.300 --> 01:52:41.630
巴顿 你到屋顶上去
Barton, I want you on that roof.

3622
01:52:41.760 --> 01:52:43.630
找出那些家伙的行进路线
Eyes on everything. Call out patterns and strays.

3623
01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:45.140
史塔克 你坚守阵地
Stark, you got the perimeter.

3624
01:52:45.260 --> 01:52:46.430
任何靠近这三条街的东西
Anything gets more than three blocks out,

3625
01:52:46.550 --> 01:52:48.100
逼他们撤退 要不就烧成灰
you turn it back or you turn it to ash.

3626
01:52:48.220 --> 01:52:49.430
- 能捎我一程吗  - 抓紧
- Can you give me a lift? - Right.

3627
01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:50.640
小心别掉下去
Better clench up, Legolas.

3628
01:52:54.230 --> 01:52:56.610
索尔 你得想办法挡住传送门
Thor, you got to try and bottleneck that portal.

3629
01:52:56.730 --> 01:52:57.900
拖住他们
Slow them down.

3630
01:52:58.020 --> 01:53:00.190
可以召唤闪电 把他们烧得精光
You got the lightning. Light the bastards up.

3631
01:53:02.490 --> 01:53:04.110
你和我 我们俩得把战场
You and me, we stay here on the ground.

3632
01:53:04.240 --> 01:53:05.280
控制在地面上
We keep the fighting here.

3633
01:53:05.410 --> 01:53:06.410
浩克
And Hulk...

3634
01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:10.200
看你的了
Smash.

3635
01:54:03.800 --> 01:54:04.920
长官
Sir.

3636
01:54:05.970 --> 01:54:06.970
议员们在线上
The Council is on.

3637
01:54:11.850 --> 01:54:15.100
史塔克 你身后有不少跟屁虫
Stark, you got a lot of strays sniffing your tail.

3638
01:54:16.940 --> 01:54:18.980
我正在 想办法甩开他们
I'm just trying to keep them off the streets.

3639
01:54:19.100 --> 01:54:21.360
我看他们转向很差
Well, they can't bank worth a damn.

3640
01:54:21.480 --> 01:54:22.650
去找个急转弯
So find a tight corner.

3641
01:54:22.770 --> 01:54:24.110
好极了 收到
I will roger that.

3642
01:54:47.090 --> 01:54:48.260
哦 来吧
Oh, boy.

3643
01:54:55.270 --> 01:54:56.890
干得好
Nice call.

3644
01:54:57.020 --> 01:54:58.230
接下来呢
What else you got?

3645
01:54:58.350 --> 01:55:01.150
索尔在六街 和一个小队恶战
Thor is taking on a squadron down on Sixth.

3646
01:55:01.270 --> 01:55:03.480
这家伙竟然没邀请我
And he didn't invite me.

3647
01:55:42.980 --> 01:55:44.610
传送门如果不关上
Captain, none of this is going to mean a damn thing

3648
01:55:44.730 --> 01:55:45.980
他们怎么也杀不完
if we don't close that portal.

3649
01:55:46.110 --> 01:55:47.780
任何武器都没办法
Our biggest guns couldn't touch it.

3650
01:55:47.900 --> 01:55:50.150
也许和武器无关
Well, maybe it's not about guns.

3651
01:55:52.070 --> 01:55:54.030
要到上面去 我们需要车
If you want to get up there, you're going to need a ride.

3652
01:55:55.120 --> 01:55:56.200
我倒有车
I got a ride.

3653
01:55:57.330 --> 01:55:58.370
但需要点帮助
I could use a boost, though.

3654
01:56:00.960 --> 01:56:01.960
你真这么做
Are you sure about this?

3655
01:56:02.420 --> 01:56:04.960
对 肯定刺激
Yeah. It's gonna be fun.

3656
01:56:31.990 --> 01:56:33.860
转向 转向
Okay, turn, turn.

3657
01:56:33.990 --> 01:56:35.740
快点 快点
Less! Less!

3658
01:57:51.400 --> 01:57:52.900
中央火车站42大街站

3659
01:57:52.900 --> 01:57:54.100
中央火车站42大街站

3660
01:57:58.450 --> 01:58:01.410
队长 42街麦迪逊路口的银行
Captain, the bank on 42nd past Madison.

3661
01:58:01.540 --> 01:58:03.290
有人被困在里面了
They've cornered a lot of civilians in there.

3662
01:58:03.410 --> 01:58:05.330
我马上来
I'm on it.

3663
01:58:25.430 --> 01:58:27.230
大家快让开
Everyone! Clear out!

3664
01:58:57.130 --> 01:58:58.800
弗瑞指挥官
Director Fury,

3665
01:58:58.930 --> 01:59:00.720
议会已经做出决定了
the Council has made a decision.

3666
01:59:00.840 --> 01:59:03.600
我知道他们会的 而且也清楚
I recognise the Council has made a decision.

3667
01:59:03.600 --> 01:59:05.310
他们会做出什么样的愚蠢决定
But given that it's a stupid-ass decision,

3668
01:59:05.430 --> 01:59:06.850
所以我想我应该忽略它
I have elected to ignore it.

3669
01:59:06.980 --> 01:59:10.310
指挥官 你的战舰最靠近战场
Director, you're closer than any of our subs.

3670
01:59:08.500 --> 01:59:11.510
加密线路通话

3671
01:59:10.440 --> 01:59:11.440
请下令让战机马上
You scramble that jet...

3672
01:59:11.560 --> 01:59:14.270
那可是曼哈顿岛 议员们
That is the island of Manhattan, Councilman.

3673
01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:16.490
除非我的小组无法阻止它们
Until I'm certain my team can't hold it,

3674
01:59:16.610 --> 01:59:18.570
否则我绝不会下令用核武器
I will not order a nuclear strike

3675
01:59:18.740 --> 01:59:20.160
攻击任何平民的
against a civilian population.

3676
01:59:20.280 --> 01:59:22.700
如果不能阻止他们一切就都完了
If we don't hold them here, we lose everything.

3677
01:59:20.350 --> 01:59:22.800
加密线路通话

3678
01:59:22.830 --> 01:59:25.580
如果发射核弹那才真完了
If I send that bird out, we already have.

3679
01:59:29.330 --> 01:59:31.040
又是你
You.

3680
01:59:33.290 --> 01:59:34.460
巴顿
Hawkeye!

3681
01:59:35.920 --> 01:59:36.920
你在干什么
Nat, what are you doing?

3682
01:59:37.840 --> 01:59:38.840
帮个忙
A little help?

3683
01:59:44.140 --> 01:59:45.140
瞄准了
I got him.

3684
02:00:11.710 --> 02:00:12.710
够了
Enough!

3685
02:00:13.040 --> 02:00:15.500
你们这些卑微低贱的人
You are, all of you, beneath me!

3686
02:00:15.630 --> 02:00:18.380
我是个神 我告诉你们
I am a god, you dull creature.

3687
02:00:18.510 --> 02:00:20.010
我才不会被蚂蚁给
And I will not be bullied by...

3688
02:00:29.850 --> 02:00:31.730
可怜的神
Puny god.

3689
02:00:39.860 --> 02:00:41.320
他的权杖
The sceptre...

3690
02:00:42.490 --> 02:00:43.700
博士
Doctor.

3691
02:00:45.570 --> 02:00:48.410
洛基的权杖 那股能量
Loki's sceptre. The energy.

3692
02:00:48.540 --> 02:00:50.200
魔方无法对抗
The Tesseract can't fight,

3693
02:00:50.330 --> 02:00:52.370
因为它 不能和自己对抗
but you can't protect against yourself.

3694
02:00:52.500 --> 02:00:53.500
这不是你的错
It's not your fault.

3695
02:00:53.620 --> 02:00:54.880
你被他控制了
You didn't know what you were doing.

3696
02:00:57.920 --> 02:01:00.090
我好像记得
Actually, I think I did.

3697
02:01:00.210 --> 02:01:03.180
我做了个保险装置
I built in a safety to cut their power source.

3698
02:01:04.380 --> 02:01:05.800
洛基的权杖
Loki's sceptre.

3699
02:01:05.930 --> 02:01:08.510
权杖能关上传送门
It may be able to close the portal.

3700
02:01:10.600 --> 02:01:12.770
它就在我眼前
And I'm looking right at it.

3701
02:01:24.740 --> 02:01:28.620
先生 穿透它的壳之前 能量会用完的
Sir, we will lose power before we penetrate that shell.

3702
02:01:35.250 --> 02:01:38.540
贾维斯 知道约拿的典故吗
Jarvis, you ever hear the tale of Jonah?

3703
02:01:38.670 --> 02:01:41.050
我  不会把他当成榜样的
I wouldn't consider him a role model.

3704
02:02:50.660 --> 02:02:52.450
弗瑞指挥官已被停职
Director Fury is no longer in command.

3705
02:02:52.580 --> 02:02:54.620
执行命令 7A11

7-Alpha-1-1, confirmed. We're go for takeoff.

3707
02:02:58.210 --> 02:03:00.290
长官 甲板上有异常
Sir, we have a bird in motion!

3708
02:03:00.790 --> 02:03:02.800
所有人员注意 有架飞机违规起飞
Anyone on the deck, we have a rogue bird.

3709
02:03:02.920 --> 02:03:04.210
把它打下来
We need to shut it down!

3710
02:03:04.340 --> 02:03:06.550
重复 起飞没获得批准
Repeat, takeoff is not authorised.

3711
02:03:37.080 --> 02:03:39.250
史塔克 听到了吗
Stark, do you hear me?

3712
02:03:39.370 --> 02:03:41.500
有架带核弹的战机飞过去了
You have a missile headed straight for the city.

3713
02:03:42.040 --> 02:03:43.420
还有多久
How long?

3714
02:03:43.540 --> 02:03:45.630
三分钟
Three minutes, max.

3715
02:03:45.750 --> 02:03:47.380
它会摧毁整个城区的
The payload will wipe out Midtown.

3716
02:03:47.510 --> 02:03:49.550
贾维斯 所有能源送进推进器
Jarvis, put everything we got into the thrusters.

3717
02:03:49.680 --> 02:03:51.340
已经完成
I just did.

3718
02:04:04.230 --> 02:04:05.570
核弹已发射
Package is sent.

3719
02:04:05.690 --> 02:04:08.820
2分30秒后引爆 完毕
Detonation in 2 minutes, 30 seconds, mark.

3720
02:04:31.590 --> 02:04:33.970
还能再打一轮吗
Are you ready for another bout?

3721
02:04:34.640 --> 02:04:35.680
怎么 你困了吗
What, are you getting sleepy?

3722
02:04:41.270 --> 02:04:43.020
对着它的顶端
Right at the crown!

3723
02:04:49.030 --> 02:04:50.820
我能关上它
I can close it.

3724
02:04:50.940 --> 02:04:52.990
有人听到吗
Can anybody copy?

3725
02:04:53.110 --> 02:04:54.240
我能关闭传送门
I can shut the portal down.

3726
02:04:54.360 --> 02:04:55.410
快关上
Do it!

3727
02:04:55.410 --> 02:04:56.410
不 等等
No, wait.

3728
02:04:56.530 --> 02:04:57.790
史塔克 敌人越来越多了
Stark, these things are still coming.

3729
02:04:57.910 --> 02:04:58.910
我这儿来了枚核弹
I got a nuke coming in.

3730
02:04:59.040 --> 02:05:00.950
一分钟内就会爆炸
It's gonna blow in less than a minute.

3731
02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:01.100
爆炸当量

3732
02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:01.100
杀伤半径

3733
02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:01.100
一

3734
02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:01.100


3735
02:05:10.630 --> 02:05:12.470
我知道该让它去哪儿了
And I knowjust where to put it.

3736
02:05:19.640 --> 02:05:22.020
史塔克 你可是有去无回
Stark, you know that's a one-way trip.

3737
02:05:22.140 --> 02:05:23.520
把能量都用来转弯 贾维斯
Save the rest for the turn, J.

3738
02:05:23.640 --> 02:05:27.730
先生 要联络珮珀小姐吗
Sir, shall I try Miss Potts?

3739
02:05:27.860 --> 02:05:29.100
联络吧
Might as well.

3740
02:05:31.820 --> 02:05:34.200
纽约市的街道变成了战场
The streets of New York City have become a battleground.

3741
02:05:33.700 --> 02:05:37.100
突发新闻

3742
02:05:33.700 --> 02:05:37.100
纽约市中心遭到袭击

3743
02:05:33.700 --> 02:05:37.100
纽约现场画面

3744
02:05:34.320 --> 02:05:37.030
军队也已经赶到了 正在试图控制局面
The Army is here trying to contain the violence

3745
02:05:37.160 --> 02:05:38.620
但是显然他们根本不是对手
but clearly, it is outmatched.

3746
02:05:38.740 --> 02:05:41.040
我不得不说 在我的职业生涯里
And I have to say, in all my years of reporting,

3747
02:05:41.160 --> 02:05:44.080
从来没有见过这种场面
I have never seen anything like this.

3748
02:05:44.210 --> 02:05:45.710
我们对这个应对小组还不是很熟悉
We have limited information on the team

3749
02:05:45.830 --> 02:05:49.590
但我们认出了钢铁侠 百万富翁托尼·史塔克
but we do know that billionaire Tony Stark's Iron Man...

3750
02:06:26.420 --> 02:06:27.600
呼叫 珮珀·波兹 失败

3751
02:07:02.910 --> 02:07:04.750
加油 史塔克
Come on, Stark.

3752
02:07:11.380 --> 02:07:12.500
关上它
Close it.

3753
02:07:32.560 --> 02:07:33.570
我的天呐
Son of a gun.

3754
02:07:38.320 --> 02:07:39.950
他没有减速
He's not slowing down.

3755
02:07:58.010 --> 02:07:59.470
还有呼吸吗
Is he breathing?

3756
02:08:27.330 --> 02:08:28.750
我的天
What the hell?

3757
02:08:31.460 --> 02:08:33.580
发生了什么
What just happened?

3758
02:08:33.710 --> 02:08:36.000
别告诉我有人亲了我一下
Please tell me nobody kissed me.

3759
02:08:40.300 --> 02:08:41.970
我们赢了
We won.

3760
02:08:44.300 --> 02:08:45.600
太好了
All right, yay!

3761
02:08:45.720 --> 02:08:47.680
嗨 干得漂亮 伙计们
Hurray. Good job, guys.

3762
02:08:47.810 --> 02:08:51.020
我看我们明天就别上班了 放一天假
Let's just not come in tomorrow. Let's just take a day.

3763
02:08:51.890 --> 02:08:53.480
吃过阿拉伯烤肉吗
Have you ever tried shawarma?

3764
02:08:53.900 --> 02:08:56.190
大概两条街外就有个馆子
There's a shawarma joint about two blocks from here.

3765
02:08:56.320 --> 02:08:57.980
不知道味道怎么样 但我想尝尝
I don't know what it is, but I want to try it.

3766
02:08:58.400 --> 02:08:59.860
我们还没完事呢
We're not finished yet.

3767
02:09:04.820 --> 02:09:06.950
那晚点再吃烤肉
And then shawarma after.

3768
02:09:28.600 --> 02:09:30.850
如果还可以的话
If it's all the same to you,

3769
02:09:34.140 --> 02:09:35.810
我想喝那杯酒
I'll have that drink now.

3770
02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:54.500
后续:异形入侵地球

3771
02:09:53.200 --> 02:10:01.200
纽约市民欢庆胜利

3772

托尼
斯塔克

3773
02:09:56.000 --> 02:10:01.200
参议院召开紧急会议

3774
02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:05.900
复仇者拯救纽约城

3775
02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:09.500
谢谢你
复仇者联盟

3776
02:09:43.650 --> 02:09:47.280
尽管这起刚刚被确认为外星人入侵的事件 造成了巨大损失
Despite the devastation of what has been confirmed as an extraterrestrial attack,

3777
02:09:47.280 --> 02:09:51.330
但是这群被称为复仇者联盟的超级英雄们
the extraordinary heroics of the group known as the Avengers

3778
02:09:51.410 --> 02:09:53.450
对很多人来说 不仅是一种欣慰
has been to many a cause not only for comfort,

3779
02:09:53.450 --> 02:09:55.960
有他们 真的挺好
but for celebration. It's just really great knowing they're out there.

3780
02:09:56.790 --> 02:09:58.590
你知道 有人能够保护我们
That someone is watching over us.

3781
02:09:58.710 --> 02:09:59.920
我爱你 索尔
I love you, Thor!

3782
02:10:00.050 --> 02:10:03.220
然后那些家伙 噼噼 就都完蛋了
And then these guys were like... And then the air goes...

3783
02:10:03.340 --> 02:10:04.720
然后那个绿巨人
And this green guy walks up and he goes...

3784
02:10:04.840 --> 02:10:05.880
不知道
I don't know.

3785
02:10:06.010 --> 02:10:08.470
不知道在纽约是不是安全
I don't exactly feel safer with those things out there.

3786
02:10:08.600 --> 02:10:11.680
好像政府隐瞒了很多事
It just seems that there's a lot they're not telling us.

3787
02:10:11.810 --> 02:10:15.530
复仇者联盟:骗局？

3788
02:10:11.810 --> 02:10:15.230
超级英雄在纽约 那怎么可能呢
Superheroes in New York? Give me a break.

3789
02:10:16.230 --> 02:10:19.000
感谢你 复仇者

3790
02:10:12.230 --> 02:10:19.830
纽约参议员质疑复仇者

3791
02:10:19.830 --> 02:10:23.230
纽约参议员质疑复仇者

3792
02:10:15.350 --> 02:10:17.270
这些所谓的英雄
These so-called "heroes"

3793
02:10:17.400 --> 02:10:20.980
应该为这个城市所遭受的破坏负责
have to be held responsible for the destruction done to this city.

3794
02:10:21.110 --> 02:10:23.240
这是他们引起的 可他们人呢
This was their fight. Where are they now?

3795
02:10:23.360 --> 02:10:26.200
有关复仇者的问题多如潮水
Tough questions are being asked about the Avengers themselves.

3796
02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:28.820
但他们却好像人间蒸发了一样 不见了踪影
Their sudden appearance and equally sudden disappearance...

3797
02:10:28.950 --> 02:10:31.740
怎么 难道这都是他们的错
What, this is all somehow their fault?

3798
02:10:33.790 --> 02:10:41.960
突发新闻

3799
02:10:33.790 --> 02:10:41.960
纽约危机幸存者

3800
02:10:33.790 --> 02:10:41.960
复仇者 - 朋友还是敌人？

3801
02:10:33.790 --> 02:10:36.960
是美国队长救了我的命
Captain America saved my life.

3802
02:10:39.080 --> 02:10:42.590
无论他在哪儿 无论他们在哪儿
Wherever he is, and wherever any of them are,

3803
02:10:42.710 --> 02:10:44.210
我只想说
I would just...

3804
02:10:45.010 --> 02:10:47.300
想说谢谢你们
I would want to say thank you.

3805
02:10:49.760 --> 02:10:51.260
复仇者们在哪儿
Where are the Avengers?

3806
02:10:51.390 --> 02:10:53.810
现在我没有追踪他们的去向
I'm not currently tracking their whereabouts.

3807
02:10:53.930 --> 02:10:56.100
我觉得他们完全有理由休息一下
I'd say they've earned a leave of absence.

3808
02:10:56.230 --> 02:10:57.810
宇宙魔方呢
And the Tesseract?

3809
02:10:57.940 --> 02:11:00.190
它去了它该去的地方
The Tesseract is where it belongs.

3810
02:11:00.610 --> 02:11:02.940
离我们很远
Out of our reach.

3811
02:11:03.070 --> 02:11:04.610
你无权决定
That's not your call.

3812
02:11:04.740 --> 02:11:05.780
我没有决定
I didn't make it.

3813
02:11:05.900 --> 02:11:08.160
我只是遵从了神的旨意
I just didn't argue with the god that did.

3814
02:11:08.280 --> 02:11:10.070
你就这么让他们拿走了
So, you let him take it

3815
02:11:10.200 --> 02:11:11.830
还有战犯洛基
and the war criminal, Loki,

3816
02:11:11.950 --> 02:11:13.660
他需要为犯罪付出代价
who should be answering for his crime.

3817
02:11:13.790 --> 02:11:16.370
哦 我想他肯定会的
I think he will be.

3818
02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:32.510
我觉得你不明白你做了什么
I don't think you understand what you've started,

3819
02:11:32.640 --> 02:11:35.100
你成立了复仇者联盟
letting the Avengers loose on this world.

3820
02:11:35.640 --> 02:11:36.640
他们很危险
They're dangerous.

3821
02:11:36.770 --> 02:11:40.440
他们是很危险 全世界都知道
They surely are, and the whole world knows it.

3822
02:11:40.980 --> 02:11:43.570
甚至是整个宇宙都知道了
Every world knows it.

3823
02:11:43.980 --> 02:11:46.070
这不正是我们的初衷吗
Was that the point of all this?

3824
02:11:46.190 --> 02:11:47.950
展现实力
A statement?

3825
02:11:50.660 --> 02:11:52.120
是自保的承诺
A promise.

3826
02:12:00.830 --> 02:12:02.380
现在该怎么办 长官
Sir, how does it work now?

3827
02:12:03.500 --> 02:12:05.500
他们都各奔东西了
They've gone their separate ways.

3828
02:12:05.630 --> 02:12:08.550
有些人 走得相当远
Some, pretty extremely far.

3829
02:12:09.300 --> 02:12:11.220
如果我们又遇到这种情况
If we get into a situation like this again,

3830
02:12:11.340 --> 02:12:12.890
该怎么对付
what happens then?

3831
02:12:13.010 --> 02:12:14.010
他们会回来的
They'll come back.

3832
02:12:15.510 --> 02:12:17.220
您真这么想吗
Are you really sure about that?

3833
02:12:17.350 --> 02:12:18.350
当然
I am.

3834
02:12:19.980 --> 02:12:21.190
为什么
Why?

3835
02:12:22.230 --> 02:12:24.440
因为我们需要他们
Because we'll need them to.
