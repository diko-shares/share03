1
00:03:55.061 --> 00:03:56.092
Help here!

2
00:03:56.506 --> 00:03:57.628
Lend a hand here!

3
00:03:57.742 --> 00:03:58.898
Anyone!

4
00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:02.192
Constable Crane?

5
00:04:02.235 --> 00:04:04.111
Ichabod Crane, is that you?

6
00:04:04.195 --> 00:04:05.529
None other.

7
00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.531
Not only me.

8
00:04:07.574 --> 00:04:09.272
I have found something,

9
00:04:09.486 --> 00:04:11.548
which was lately a man.

10
00:04:15.582 --> 00:04:16.585
Burn it.

11
00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:17.863
Yes, sir.

12
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:21.837
Just a moment, if I may.
We do not yet know the cause of death.

13
00:04:21.921 --> 00:04:25.424
When you find them in the river,
cause of death is drowning.

14
00:04:25.508 --> 00:04:27.194
Possibly so,
if there is water in the lungs,

15
00:04:27.218 --> 00:04:30.346
but by pathology we might be able to
determine whether or not he was dead

16
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.638
before he went into the river.

17
00:04:31.723 --> 00:04:33.766
I will need to examine the body.

18
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:34.997
Cut him up.

19
00:04:35.211 --> 00:04:36.982
Are we heathens?

20
00:04:38.605 --> 00:04:39.688
What happened to him?

21
00:04:39.773 --> 00:04:42.024
Nothing, sir. Arrested for burglary.

22
00:04:50.033 --> 00:04:51.158
Good work.

23
00:04:52.327 --> 00:04:54.495
The millennium is almost upon us.

24
00:04:54.954 --> 00:04:58.415
In a few months,
we will be living in the 19th century,

25
00:04:58.458 --> 00:05:01.960
yet our courts continue
to rely on medieval devices of torture.

26
00:05:02.003 --> 00:05:03.128
Stand down!

27
00:05:03.213 --> 00:05:06.298
I stand up for sense and justice.

28
00:05:06.383 --> 00:05:08.592
Our jails overflow with men and women

29
00:05:08.635 --> 00:05:10.761
convicted on confessions
worth no more than this one.

30
00:05:10.804 --> 00:05:12.179
Constable Crane!

31
00:05:13.348 --> 00:05:17.142
This is a song that we have heard
from you more than once.

32
00:05:17.227 --> 00:05:20.979
Now, there are two courses open to me.

33
00:05:21.022 --> 00:05:24.983
First, I can let you cool your heels
in the cells

34
00:05:25.068 --> 00:05:28.253
until you learn respect
for the dignity of my office.

35
00:05:28.296 --> 00:05:29.680
I beg pardon.

36
00:05:29.823 --> 00:05:33.450
But why am I the only one
who sees that, to solve crimes,

37
00:05:33.493 --> 00:05:36.829
to detect the guilty,
we must use our brains

38
00:05:36.913 --> 00:05:38.641
to recognize vital clues,

39
00:05:38.665 --> 00:05:41.514
using up-to-date scientific techniques?

40
00:05:41.584 --> 00:05:44.711
Which brings me to the second course.

41
00:05:45.505 --> 00:05:49.425
There is a town upstate,
two days' journey to the north

42
00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:51.427
in the Hudson Highlands.

43
00:05:51.511 --> 00:05:55.264
It is a place called Sleepy Hollow.

44
00:05:56.141 --> 00:05:57.483
Have you heard of it?

45
00:05:58.101 --> 00:05:59.184
I have not.

46
00:05:59.227 --> 00:06:02.938
An isolated farming community,
mainly Dutch.

47
00:06:03.022 --> 00:06:07.484
Three persons have been
murdered there, all within a fortnight.

48
00:06:07.986 --> 00:06:10.483
Each one found with the head,

49
00:06:11.097 --> 00:06:12.377
lopped off.

50
00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:13.866
Lopped off?

51
00:06:13.908 --> 00:06:16.910
Clean as dandelion heads, apparently.

52
00:06:18.037 --> 00:06:21.165
You will take
these experimentations of yours,

53
00:06:21.207 --> 00:06:22.941
to Sleepy Hollow,

54
00:06:23.126 --> 00:06:26.837
and there you will detect the murderer.

55
00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.716
Bring him here to face our good justice.

56
00:06:32.093 --> 00:06:33.469
Will you do this?

57
00:06:34.888 --> 00:06:36.013
I shall.

58
00:06:36.931 --> 00:06:40.058
Remember, it is you,

59
00:06:40.101 --> 00:06:42.644
Ichabod Crane,

60
00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:45.981
who is now put to the test.

61
00:11:50.161 --> 00:11:53.163
The Pickety Witch, the Pickety Witch.

62
00:11:53.206 --> 00:11:55.248
Who's got a kiss for the Pickety Witch?

63
00:11:55.333 --> 00:11:57.667
The Pickety Witch, the Pickety Witch.

64
00:11:57.710 --> 00:12:00.545
Who's got a kiss for the Pickety Witch?

65
00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:04.049
Is it Theodore?

66
00:12:04.091 --> 00:12:06.218
No, pardon, miss. I am only a stranger.

67
00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.094
Then have a kiss on account.

68
00:12:15.728 --> 00:12:18.897
I'm looking for Baltus Van Tassel.

69
00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:21.650
I'm his daughter, Katrina Van Tassel.

70
00:12:21.734 --> 00:12:24.319
And who are you, friend?
We have not heard your name yet.

71
00:12:24.403 --> 00:12:25.862
I've not said it.

72
00:12:25.886 --> 00:12:26.886
Excuse me.

73
00:12:27.907 --> 00:12:29.574
You need some manners.
Brom.

74
00:12:29.659 --> 00:12:31.868
Come, come.
We'll have no raised voices.

75
00:12:31.911 --> 00:12:34.746
It is only to raise spirits
during this dark time

76
00:12:34.831 --> 00:12:38.917
that I and my dear wife
are giving this little party.

77
00:12:39.001 --> 00:12:42.921
Young sir, you are most welcome,
even if you are selling something.

78
00:12:42.964 --> 00:12:44.089
Thank you, sir.

79
00:12:44.632 --> 00:12:48.009
I am Constable Ichabod Crane,
sent to you from New York

80
00:12:48.094 --> 00:12:49.970
to investigate murder in Sleepy Hollow.

81
00:12:50.054 --> 00:12:53.598
Then Sleepy Hollow
is grateful to you, Constable Crane.

82
00:12:53.683 --> 00:12:56.726
And we hope you will honour us
by remaining in this house.

83
00:12:56.769 --> 00:12:58.311
Well spoke, dear.

84
00:12:58.396 --> 00:13:00.241
Come, sir, we'll get you settled.

85
00:13:00.755 --> 00:13:01.755
Play on!

86
00:13:08.406 --> 00:13:09.548
Excuse me, please.

87
00:13:15.288 --> 00:13:16.421
Thank you.

88
00:13:16.706 --> 00:13:19.583
Please tell Mr. Van Tassel
I will be down in a moment.

89
00:13:19.625 --> 00:13:20.876
I will, sir.

90
00:13:24.463 --> 00:13:26.298
Thank God you're here.

91
00:13:38.394 --> 00:13:39.895
Excellent. Come in.

92
00:13:40.409 --> 00:13:41.709
Leave us, my dear.

93
00:13:45.526 --> 00:13:48.653
We are joined by
Dr. Thomas Lancaster,

94
00:13:48.738 --> 00:13:50.322
Reverend Steenwyck,

95
00:13:50.406 --> 00:13:53.116
our able Magistrate Samuel Philipse,

96
00:13:53.159 --> 00:13:54.284
and lastly,

97
00:13:54.327 --> 00:13:58.622
this fine fellow is James Hardenbrook,
our notary.

98
00:13:58.664 --> 00:14:00.498
And you, sir?

99
00:14:00.583 --> 00:14:03.710
A simple farmer who has prospered.

100
00:14:03.794 --> 00:14:07.172
The town looks to me
as friend and counsel.

101
00:14:07.214 --> 00:14:10.175
And landlord and banker.
Can we proceed?

102
00:14:10.259 --> 00:14:11.343
Thank you.

103
00:14:13.679 --> 00:14:14.763
So...

104
00:14:16.682 --> 00:14:19.225
Three persons murdered.

105
00:14:20.895 --> 00:14:23.730
First, Peter Van Garrett,

106
00:14:24.565 --> 00:14:27.359
and his son, Dirk Van Garrett.

107
00:14:28.444 --> 00:14:29.854
Both of them,

108
00:14:30.068 --> 00:14:32.669
strong, capable men,

109
00:14:33.699 --> 00:14:35.033
found together,

110
00:14:36.369 --> 00:14:37.577
decapitated.

111
00:14:40.581 --> 00:14:42.791
One week later, the Widow Winship.

112
00:14:44.293 --> 00:14:47.253
Also decapitated.

113
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:53.885
Now, I will need to ask you
many questions.

114
00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:58.390
But first, let me ask,
is anyone suspected?

115
00:15:02.395 --> 00:15:05.922
How much have your superiors
explained to you, Constable?

116
00:15:06.941 --> 00:15:11.444
Only that the three
were slain in open ground,

117
00:15:12.196 --> 00:15:15.573
their heads found severed
from their bodies.

118
00:15:16.033 --> 00:15:18.310
Their heads were not found severed.

119
00:15:18.494 --> 00:15:20.620
Their heads were not found at all.

120
00:15:23.624 --> 00:15:26.710
The heads are gone?

121
00:15:26.752 --> 00:15:27.961
Taken.

122
00:15:28.045 --> 00:15:30.664
Taken by the Headless Horseman.

123
00:15:31.048 --> 00:15:32.924
Taken back to hell.

124
00:15:34.468 --> 00:15:35.927
Pardon, I don't...

125
00:15:36.012 --> 00:15:38.596
Perhaps you had better sit down.

126
00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:42.267
Yes.

127
00:15:46.647 --> 00:15:49.399
The horseman was
a Hessian mercenary,

128
00:15:49.442 --> 00:15:52.193
sent to these shores by German princes,

129
00:15:52.278 --> 00:15:55.196
to keep Americans
under the yoke of England.

130
00:15:55.281 --> 00:15:59.325
But unlike his compatriots,
who came for money,

131
00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:02.679
the horseman came for love of carnage.

132
00:16:03.122 --> 00:16:06.916
When battle was joined,
there you'd find him.

133
00:16:09.754 --> 00:16:13.214
He rode a giant black steed
named Daredevil.

134
00:16:15.885 --> 00:16:19.304
He was infamous
for riding his horse hard into battle,

135
00:16:19.388 --> 00:16:21.931
chopping off heads at full gallop.

136
00:16:21.974 --> 00:16:25.602
He had filed his teeth
down to sharp points

137
00:16:25.644 --> 00:16:28.313
to add to the ferocity of his appearance.

138
00:16:37.156 --> 00:16:40.366
This butcher didn't finally reach his end

139
00:16:40.785 --> 00:16:42.994
until the winter of '79

140
00:16:44.872 --> 00:16:48.166
not far from here in our Western Woods.

141
00:17:42.513 --> 00:17:44.973
They chopped off his head
with his own sword.

142
00:17:45.057 --> 00:17:48.101
Even today,
the Western Woods is a haunted place,

143
00:17:48.185 --> 00:17:50.395
where brave men will not venture.

144
00:17:52.815 --> 00:17:55.316
For what was planted
in the ground that day

145
00:17:56.735 --> 00:17:58.361
was a seed of evil.

146
00:18:01.574 --> 00:18:03.908
And so it has been for 20 years.

147
00:18:04.743 --> 00:18:06.494
But now the Hessian wakes.

148
00:18:06.912 --> 00:18:10.540
He's on the rampage,
cutting off heads where he finds them.

149
00:18:15.838 --> 00:18:17.414
Are you saying...

150
00:18:18.799 --> 00:18:20.550
Is that what you believe?

151
00:18:21.927 --> 00:18:24.345
Seeing is believing.

152
00:18:26.098 --> 00:18:30.768
They tell me that you've brought books
and trappings of scientific investigation.

153
00:18:31.145 --> 00:18:32.198
This...

154
00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:35.569
is the only book I recommend you read.

155
00:18:43.324 --> 00:18:44.616
I see.

156
00:18:46.118 --> 00:18:48.286
Reverend Steenwyck.

157
00:18:49.038 --> 00:18:50.121
Gentlemen.

158
00:18:51.749 --> 00:18:55.043
Murder needs no ghosts
to come from the grave.

159
00:18:55.127 --> 00:18:59.422
We have murders in New York
without benefit of ghouls and goblins.

160
00:18:59.465 --> 00:19:01.966
You're a long way
from New York, Constable.

161
00:19:02.426 --> 00:19:03.459
The assassin,

162
00:19:04.573 --> 00:19:07.639
is a man of flesh and blood
and I will discover him.

163
00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:50.056
Come out, devil.

164
00:20:42.568 --> 00:20:44.068
His name's Gunpowder.

165
00:20:44.987 --> 00:20:47.238
He should do just fine, Mr. Killian.

166
00:20:47.906 --> 00:20:49.032
Thank you.

167
00:20:49.575 --> 00:20:51.553
Good luck, sir.
If you need help, you call my name.

168
00:20:51.577 --> 00:20:53.036
Much appreciated.

169
00:20:53.579 --> 00:20:55.697
Now, don't you worry about a thing.

170
00:20:56.081 --> 00:20:58.207
Everything's going to be just fine.

171
00:21:00.169 --> 00:21:02.837
Thomas! Inside!

172
00:21:04.923 --> 00:21:06.424
Run along for your breakfast.

173
00:21:06.467 --> 00:21:08.618
Kiss your mother
once for you and twice for me.

174
00:21:08.761 --> 00:21:11.763
Murder! The horseman's killed again!

175
00:21:13.557 --> 00:21:16.309
All right, Gunpowder, we're off.
Come on.

176
00:21:16.935 --> 00:21:18.353
No, no. Come on, the other way.

177
00:21:18.437 --> 00:21:19.937
No, no. Turn around.

178
00:21:25.694 --> 00:21:26.903
Good horsey.

179
00:21:38.791 --> 00:21:42.418
Mr. Miller, ride back for the coffin cart.
Yes, sir.

180
00:21:42.503 --> 00:21:44.696
The rest of you keep a sharp lookout.

181
00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:48.758
It's all right. I'm here now.

182
00:22:13.826 --> 00:22:16.327
The fourth victim, Jonathan Masbath.

183
00:22:19.706 --> 00:22:20.998
I see.

184
00:22:21.917 --> 00:22:24.043
And the head?

185
00:22:25.838 --> 00:22:26.923
Taken.

186
00:22:27.836 --> 00:22:28.836
Taken.

187
00:22:30.509 --> 00:22:31.466
Interesting.

188
00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:32.940
Very interesting.

189
00:22:33.011 --> 00:22:34.053
What is?

190
00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:37.932
In headless-corpse cases of this sort,
the head is removed

191
00:22:38.016 --> 00:22:39.809
to prevent identification of the body.

192
00:22:39.852 --> 00:22:42.695
But we know
this was Jonathan Masbath.

193
00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:45.356
Precisely. So why was
the head removed?

194
00:22:45.441 --> 00:22:46.607
Why?
Right.

195
00:22:49.695 --> 00:22:51.946
You have moved the body?
I did.

196
00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:54.824
You must never move the body!
Why not?

197
00:22:55.159 --> 00:22:56.242
Because.

198
00:23:11.091 --> 00:23:13.217
The stride is gigantic.

199
00:23:16.013 --> 00:23:17.972
The attacker rode Masbath down,

200
00:23:19.308 --> 00:23:20.683
turned his horse,

201
00:23:22.019 --> 00:23:23.211
came back.

202
00:23:23.896 --> 00:23:25.813
Came back to claim the head.

203
00:23:43.749 --> 00:23:44.832
Yes.

204
00:23:45.918 --> 00:23:47.877
There's a chemical reaction.

205
00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:51.297
It shows there was a powerful,
singular thrust to the neck.

206
00:24:18.617 --> 00:24:19.708
Interesting.

207
00:24:19.732 --> 00:24:20.923
What is it?

208
00:24:22.454 --> 00:24:24.997
The wound was cauterized
in the very instant,

209
00:24:26.792 --> 00:24:28.960
as though the blade itself were red hot.

210
00:24:29.044 --> 00:24:32.463
And yet, no blistering, no scorched flesh.

211
00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:36.175
The Devil's fire.

212
00:24:43.392 --> 00:24:46.519
Be vigilant, as it sayeth
in the Book of Peter,

213
00:24:46.603 --> 00:24:48.854
chapter five, verse eight.

214
00:24:49.648 --> 00:24:51.482
Because your adversary the devil,

215
00:24:51.525 --> 00:24:53.289
as a roaring lion,

216
00:24:53.313 --> 00:24:54.790
walketh about,

217
00:24:55.696 --> 00:24:57.905
seeking whom he may devour.

218
00:24:59.658 --> 00:25:02.034
God rest Jonathan Masbath.

219
00:25:03.662 --> 00:25:05.037
Amen.

220
00:25:29.021 --> 00:25:30.521
Mr. Constable, sir.

221
00:25:33.025 --> 00:25:34.442
You're young Masbath.

222
00:25:34.526 --> 00:25:36.033
I was young Masbath,

223
00:25:36.247 --> 00:25:38.208
but now the only one.

224
00:25:38.238 --> 00:25:40.281
Masbath, at your service.

225
00:25:40.365 --> 00:25:42.700
In honour bound to avenge my father.

226
00:25:43.535 --> 00:25:46.996
Well, one and only Masbath,
I thank you very much,

227
00:25:47.039 --> 00:25:49.615
but your mother will need you
more than I.

228
00:25:50.709 --> 00:25:52.543
My mother is in heaven, sir.

229
00:25:53.211 --> 00:25:55.838
She has my father now to care for her.

230
00:25:55.881 --> 00:26:00.301
But you have no one to serve you.
I am your man, sir.

231
00:26:00.385 --> 00:26:04.055
Yes, and a brave one, too. But I cannot
be the one to look after you.

232
00:26:06.433 --> 00:26:08.934
I'm sorry for your loss,
young Mr. Masbath.

233
00:26:21.907 --> 00:26:23.824
Constable Crane.
Mr. Philipse?

234
00:26:23.909 --> 00:26:25.318
Something you should know.

235
00:26:26.244 --> 00:26:28.954
Jonathan Masbath
was not the fourth victim,

236
00:26:30.499 --> 00:26:32.333
but the fifth.
The fifth?

237
00:26:32.417 --> 00:26:33.442
Aye.

238
00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:37.963
Five victims in four graves.

239
00:26:49.601 --> 00:26:50.935
Young Masbath.

240
00:26:51.687 --> 00:26:53.748
Find a place in the Van Tassel's
servants' quarters.

241
00:26:53.772 --> 00:26:55.272
Wake me before dawn.

242
00:26:55.565 --> 00:26:57.450
I hope you have a strong stomach.

243
00:27:00.237 --> 00:27:01.654
Peter Van Garrett.

244
00:27:02.739 --> 00:27:04.198
Dirk Van Garrett.

245
00:27:04.991 --> 00:27:06.492
Jonathan Masbath.

246
00:27:07.619 --> 00:27:11.080
There are five victims, four graves.

247
00:27:25.178 --> 00:27:27.638
The Widow Winship.

248
00:27:52.289 --> 00:27:53.748
Bring the Widow in.

249
00:27:56.042 --> 00:27:58.335
This is most irregular, Constable.

250
00:27:58.378 --> 00:28:00.913
I should hope so, Doctor,
but in this case, necessary.

251
00:28:01.298 --> 00:28:02.882
We need to operate immediately.

252
00:28:02.966 --> 00:28:05.801
Operate? She's dead.

253
00:28:06.636 --> 00:28:07.845
When we say operate,

254
00:28:07.888 --> 00:28:10.806
we mean, of course,
I will need the operating table.

255
00:28:14.311 --> 00:28:17.772
Once more, the neck wound cauterized.

256
00:28:20.275 --> 00:28:23.569
The sword thrust to the stomach,
the same.

257
00:28:23.653 --> 00:28:25.362
But to what purpose?

258
00:28:25.405 --> 00:28:27.623
To what is your purpose is the question.

259
00:28:28.325 --> 00:28:31.535
What manner of instruments are these?

260
00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:33.204
Some of my own design.

261
00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:37.500
All right, then.
Step outside, young Masbath.

262
00:28:37.542 --> 00:28:39.622
Thank you very, very much
for your help, Mr. Killian.

263
00:28:39.669 --> 00:28:41.962
And if you don't mind, Doctor,

264
00:28:42.047 --> 00:28:45.141
my concentration suffers greatly
when I'm observed.

265
00:29:25.382 --> 00:29:26.632
I am finished.

266
00:29:26.842 --> 00:29:29.593
What in the name of God
have you done to her?

267
00:29:29.678 --> 00:29:32.137
We are dealing with a madman.

268
00:29:32.597 --> 00:29:34.598
What did you find out, Constable?

269
00:29:34.641 --> 00:29:37.059
The Widow Winship was with child.

270
00:29:59.791 --> 00:30:00.958
Ichabod.

271
00:30:02.252 --> 00:30:05.504
Ichabod. Ichabod.

272
00:30:06.798 --> 00:30:07.965
Ichabod.

273
00:30:23.148 --> 00:30:24.315
Who's there?

274
00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:01.889
Pardon my intrusion, I saw a light.

275
00:33:01.973 --> 00:33:05.392
It is no intrusion.
I come here to read when I am wakeful.

276
00:33:10.315 --> 00:33:13.484
To read books which you must hide?

277
00:33:13.568 --> 00:33:16.320
They were my mother's books.
My father believes

278
00:33:16.404 --> 00:33:19.156
tales of romance caused the brain fever
that killed my mother.

279
00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:21.492
She died two years ago come midwinter.

280
00:33:22.619 --> 00:33:24.430
The nurse who cared for her
during her sickness

281
00:33:24.454 --> 00:33:26.080
is now Lady Van Tassel.

282
00:33:27.415 --> 00:33:29.333
There was something else, too.

283
00:33:29.751 --> 00:33:31.543
Why did no one think to mention that

284
00:33:31.628 --> 00:33:34.630
the Van Garretts are kith and kin
to the Van Tassels?

285
00:33:34.672 --> 00:33:37.216
Why, because there is hardly
a household in Sleepy Hollow

286
00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:40.511
that is not connected
to every other by blood or marriage.

287
00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:41.745
I see.

288
00:33:47.018 --> 00:33:49.561
This land we're looking at
was Van Garrett land,

289
00:33:49.646 --> 00:33:52.297
given to my father
when I was in swaddling clothes.

290
00:33:52.482 --> 00:33:54.983
The Van Garretts were
the richest family around these parts.

291
00:33:55.026 --> 00:33:57.152
When my father brought us
to Sleepy Hollow,

292
00:33:57.195 --> 00:34:00.114
Van Garrett set him up with an acre
and a broken-down cottage.

293
00:34:00.198 --> 00:34:04.284
My father worked hard for his family,
and prospered and built this house.

294
00:34:04.369 --> 00:34:06.270
And I owe my happiness to him.

295
00:34:07.539 --> 00:34:09.832
I remember living poor in the cottage.

296
00:34:11.167 --> 00:34:12.543
Should I show you?

297
00:34:13.253 --> 00:34:14.378
Yes.

298
00:34:17.465 --> 00:34:18.465
Take this.

299
00:34:19.114 --> 00:34:20.664
It is my gift for you.

300
00:34:21.553 --> 00:34:23.095
No, I have no use for it.

301
00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:25.264
Are you so certain of everything?

302
00:34:37.944 --> 00:34:39.069
It was your mother's.

303
00:34:39.154 --> 00:34:42.698
Keep it close to your heart.
It is sure protection against harm.

304
00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:49.913
Are you so certain of everything?

305
00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:08.807
These are strange.
These markings, what are they?

306
00:35:08.892 --> 00:35:11.059
I've had them since I can remember.

307
00:35:21.946 --> 00:35:24.406
I used to play by this hearth as a child.

308
00:35:28.369 --> 00:35:30.395
It was my first drawing school,

309
00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:32.456
and my mother was my teacher.

310
00:35:35.126 --> 00:35:37.127
Oh, look. See?

311
00:35:37.212 --> 00:35:39.922
Carved into the fire back? The archer.

312
00:35:41.049 --> 00:35:42.424
I'd forgotten it.

313
00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:46.637
This was from long before we lived here.

314
00:35:49.682 --> 00:35:50.997
Are you all right?

315
00:35:51.511 --> 00:35:52.647
Yes, thank you.

316
00:35:55.063 --> 00:35:57.314
A cardinal. My favourite.

317
00:35:57.815 --> 00:36:00.993
I'd love to have a tame one, but
I wouldn't have the heart to cage him.

318
00:36:01.986 --> 00:36:03.313
Well, then I...

319
00:36:04.327 --> 00:36:05.810
I have something for you.

320
00:36:08.326 --> 00:36:11.787
Cardinal on one side. An empty cage.

321
00:36:12.664 --> 00:36:14.039
And now...

322
00:36:17.335 --> 00:36:19.753
You can do magic. Teach me.

323
00:36:19.837 --> 00:36:21.436
It is no magic.

324
00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:23.854
It is what we call optics.

325
00:36:24.384 --> 00:36:27.719
Separate pictures
which become one in the spinning.

326
00:36:27.804 --> 00:36:31.231
It is truth, but truth is
not always appearance.

327
00:37:21.899 --> 00:37:23.739
What are you running from,
Magistrate Philipse?

328
00:37:23.818 --> 00:37:24.901
Damn you, Crane.

329
00:37:24.986 --> 00:37:27.070
You had a mind to help me?
Yes,

330
00:37:27.155 --> 00:37:29.406
and it's put me in mortal dread of...
Of what?

331
00:37:29.949 --> 00:37:32.701
Of powers against which
there is no defence. Come.

332
00:37:32.744 --> 00:37:34.972
How did you know the Widow Winship
was expecting a child?

333
00:37:34.996 --> 00:37:36.204
She told me.

334
00:37:36.706 --> 00:37:39.708
Then I deduce you are the father.
I'm not the father.

335
00:37:39.751 --> 00:37:41.918
Did she tell you
the name of the child's father?

336
00:37:41.961 --> 00:37:44.004
Yes, she did.

337
00:37:44.088 --> 00:37:46.673
She came to me for advice
as town magistrate

338
00:37:46.758 --> 00:37:48.884
to protect the rights of her child.

339
00:37:48.926 --> 00:37:51.762
I was bound by my oath of office
to keep the secret, but...

340
00:37:51.846 --> 00:37:53.326
Do you believe the father killed her?

341
00:37:53.389 --> 00:37:55.891
The Horseman killed her.

342
00:37:55.933 --> 00:37:58.143
How often do I have to tell you?
There is no Horseman.

343
00:37:58.227 --> 00:38:01.271
Never was a Horseman,
and never will be a Horseman.

344
00:38:01.356 --> 00:38:03.106
What is that thing?

345
00:38:03.149 --> 00:38:05.692
My talisman.
It protects me from the Horseman.

346
00:38:05.777 --> 00:38:08.904
You, a magistrate,
and your head full of such nonsense.

347
00:38:08.946 --> 00:38:10.781
Now, tell me the name of...

348
00:38:31.469 --> 00:38:32.594
Oh, my God.

349
00:39:18.474 --> 00:39:21.118
Constable Crane? Constable Crane?

350
00:39:22.145 --> 00:39:23.937
Has he not come out at all?

351
00:39:29.819 --> 00:39:30.954
It was a headless horseman.

352
00:39:30.978 --> 00:39:32.292
You must not excite yourself.

353
00:39:32.363 --> 00:39:33.507
But it was a headless horseman!

354
00:39:33.531 --> 00:39:35.449
Of course it was.
That's why you're here.

355
00:39:35.533 --> 00:39:36.842
No, you must believe me.

356
00:39:36.866 --> 00:39:39.174
It was a horseman, a dead one.
Headless.

357
00:39:39.203 --> 00:39:40.328
I know. I know.

358
00:39:40.371 --> 00:39:42.988
You don't know because you were not there!

359
00:39:43.012 --> 00:39:44.012
It's all true.

360
00:39:44.041 --> 00:39:47.002
Of course it is. I told you.
Everyone told you.

361
00:39:48.337 --> 00:39:50.547
I saw him.

362
00:39:56.053 --> 00:39:58.388
I suppose it's back to the city, then.

363
00:41:21.889 --> 00:41:25.141
All right, this time
I'll go to New York myself.

364
00:41:25.184 --> 00:41:27.894
I won't be fobbed off
with an amateur deductor.

365
00:41:39.991 --> 00:41:42.284
This time, it's a magistrate
that's dead and...

366
00:41:42.326 --> 00:41:43.377
Gentlemen.

367
00:41:44.161 --> 00:41:47.230
I need able men to go with me
into the Western Woods.

368
00:41:47.415 --> 00:41:48.415
You?

369
00:41:48.853 --> 00:41:50.623
We thought you'd shot your bolt.

370
00:41:50.793 --> 00:41:52.877
I have faced my fears,
and come out determined

371
00:41:52.962 --> 00:41:54.546
to locate the Horseman's grave.

372
00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:58.216
In short, to pit myself
against a murdering ghost.

373
00:42:00.511 --> 00:42:01.803
Who's with me?

374
00:42:04.932 --> 00:42:06.016
Me.

375
00:42:07.685 --> 00:42:10.395
The Van Garretts, Widow Winship,

376
00:42:10.479 --> 00:42:14.190
your father, Jonathan Masbath,
and now Philipse.

377
00:42:14.734 --> 00:42:16.568
Something must connect them.

378
00:42:17.069 --> 00:42:19.738
Did your father
have dealings with the Van Garretts?

379
00:42:19.822 --> 00:42:22.532
He worked for them.
We lived in the coach house.

380
00:42:24.201 --> 00:42:25.410
It's nothing.

381
00:42:27.330 --> 00:42:30.457
But there was something that happened
one night, a week before the murder.

382
00:42:30.541 --> 00:42:33.668
An argument upstairs
between father and son.

383
00:42:33.711 --> 00:42:36.671
And my father was later sent for
by Mr. Van Garrett.

384
00:42:38.424 --> 00:42:41.217
An argument between father and son.

385
00:42:42.053 --> 00:42:45.555
After which the elder Van Garrett sent
for his servant Masbath.

386
00:42:46.182 --> 00:42:47.349
Listen.

387
00:42:49.101 --> 00:42:50.727
I hear nothing.
Nor I.

388
00:42:51.812 --> 00:42:56.232
No birds. No crickets.
It's all gone so quiet.

389
00:43:05.076 --> 00:43:06.326
Quicken pace.

390
00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:57.460
Pardon our intrusion,

391
00:43:57.503 --> 00:44:00.268
but perhaps you could help us?

392
00:44:00.369 --> 00:44:01.644
You're from the Hollow.

393
00:44:02.091 --> 00:44:04.584
Yes. In a way, yes.

394
00:44:08.139 --> 00:44:12.475
I should like to say that I make
no assumptions about your occupation.

395
00:44:12.518 --> 00:44:16.229
Nor your ways, which, which, which,
which are,

396
00:44:16.313 --> 00:44:18.314
nothing to me, whatever you are.

397
00:44:19.233 --> 00:44:20.650
Each to his own.

398
00:44:31.162 --> 00:44:33.830
Do you know of the Horseman, ma'am?

399
00:44:34.244 --> 00:44:35.470
The Hessian?

400
00:44:38.669 --> 00:44:40.253
That'll be him, ma'am.

401
00:44:41.505 --> 00:44:43.423
You, come with me.

402
00:44:44.341 --> 00:44:47.010
Go out, child. Keep away.

403
00:44:47.052 --> 00:44:49.345
Whatever you hear, keep away.

404
00:44:56.061 --> 00:44:58.772
What might he hear
that he must keep away from?

405
00:45:05.029 --> 00:45:08.490
He rides. To the Hollow and back.

406
00:45:08.532 --> 00:45:09.679
I hear him.

407
00:45:10.493 --> 00:45:12.732
I smell the blood on him.
Do you?

408
00:45:14.872 --> 00:45:19.584
Well, I'm here to find him
and make him stop.

409
00:45:26.717 --> 00:45:28.551
You seek knowledge of the netherworld?

410
00:45:28.594 --> 00:45:29.844
I can show you.

411
00:45:38.938 --> 00:45:40.179
What are you doing?

412
00:45:40.593 --> 00:45:42.578
Do not move or speak.

413
00:45:42.608 --> 00:45:45.151
When the other comes, I will hold him.

414
00:45:45.236 --> 00:45:46.158
The other?

415
00:45:46.182 --> 00:45:48.417
Silence. He comes now.

416
00:45:58.541 --> 00:45:59.624
Madam?

417
00:46:02.503 --> 00:46:03.987
Madam, do you hear me?

418
00:46:16.642 --> 00:46:20.603
You seek the warrior bathed in blood,
the Headless Horseman.

419
00:46:20.688 --> 00:46:24.440
Follow the Indian trail
to where the sun dies.

420
00:46:24.525 --> 00:46:26.526
Follow it to the Tree of the Dead.

421
00:46:26.610 --> 00:46:30.080
Climb down
to the Horseman's resting place.

422
00:46:37.621 --> 00:46:38.788
We're leaving.

423
00:46:38.831 --> 00:46:40.357
What happened?
We're leaving now.

424
00:46:43.210 --> 00:46:45.545
We take the Indian trail
to the Tree of the Dead.

425
00:46:45.629 --> 00:46:48.798
How will we recognize it?
Without difficulty, I rather fear.

426
00:46:48.883 --> 00:46:51.259
We climb down
to the Horseman's resting place.

427
00:46:51.302 --> 00:46:53.303
His camp?
His grave.

428
00:47:04.565 --> 00:47:05.949
Stay here.

429
00:47:43.687 --> 00:47:45.539
Halt and turn, I have a pistol aimed.

430
00:47:48.108 --> 00:47:49.284
Katrina?

431
00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:52.070
I might have killed you.
Why have you come?

432
00:47:52.154 --> 00:47:54.405
Because no one else would go with you.

433
00:47:55.491 --> 00:47:57.417
Well, then I am now twice the man.

434
00:47:59.119 --> 00:48:00.745
It is your white magic.

435
00:48:04.833 --> 00:48:06.334
Pardon my intrusion.

436
00:48:06.377 --> 00:48:09.128
I think you'd better come and look at this.

437
00:48:51.672 --> 00:48:53.623
The Tree of the Dead.

438
00:49:10.649 --> 00:49:12.058
Blood.

439
00:49:15.237 --> 00:49:16.639
Stay where you are.

440
00:49:57.654 --> 00:49:58.801
What is it?

441
00:49:59.815 --> 00:50:01.954
Just stay where you are.
Don't move.

442
00:50:17.549 --> 00:50:19.439
This tree is a gateway.

443
00:50:19.463 --> 00:50:22.024
A gateway between two worlds.

444
00:50:34.691 --> 00:50:36.524
This ground has been disturbed.

445
00:50:37.138 --> 00:50:38.407
The soil is loose.

446
00:50:38.779 --> 00:50:40.196
Bring the shovel.

447
00:50:58.298 --> 00:51:02.802
The skull is gone. Taken.

448
00:51:03.345 --> 00:51:06.055
That is why the Horseman
returns from the grave.

449
00:51:06.223 --> 00:51:10.393
To take heads
till his own is restored to him.

450
00:51:28.245 --> 00:51:29.446
Ichabod?

451
00:52:18.795 --> 00:52:21.464
Split up. Glenn. Theodore.

452
00:52:41.235 --> 00:52:44.487
Don't pick your teeth,
you'll teach Thomas bad habits.

453
00:52:44.571 --> 00:52:45.821
I am a bad habit.

454
00:52:46.335 --> 00:52:48.721
There's nothing for it.
Oh, isn't there?

455
00:53:08.637 --> 00:53:11.714
Come on, let's get ready for bed.
Yes.

456
00:53:33.787 --> 00:53:35.022
Beth, run!

457
00:53:56.685 --> 00:53:58.086
Stay quiet.

458
00:56:43.518 --> 00:56:45.512
Wait! He's not after you.

459
00:56:45.826 --> 00:56:47.201
I'll get him.

460
00:57:07.209 --> 00:57:08.484
We cannot win this.

461
00:58:07.519 --> 00:58:10.145
Remarkable.
A wound like this should've killed him.

462
00:58:10.230 --> 00:58:13.482
But it needs no stitch,
and there's hardly a loss of blood.

463
00:58:15.151 --> 00:58:16.738
You must be still.

464
00:58:16.762 --> 00:58:18.625
The fever is on you.

465
00:58:20.323 --> 00:58:21.699
Katrina.

466
00:58:22.117 --> 00:58:25.619
Nostradamus mediamus, milk of mercy,

467
00:58:25.996 --> 00:58:28.998
in media nos laudamas.

468
00:58:45.724 --> 00:58:49.360
Katrina, I tried to stop Brom, but...

469
00:58:50.562 --> 00:58:51.658
Drink this down.

470
00:58:51.682 --> 00:58:53.201
It'll make you sleep.

471
00:58:54.190 --> 00:58:56.605
The Horseman was not set
to kill Brom or me.

472
00:58:57.019 --> 00:58:58.832
Had Brom not attacked him...

473
00:58:58.862 --> 00:59:00.429
Later. Rest now.

474
00:59:00.614 --> 00:59:02.132
I've discovered something.

475
00:59:02.346 --> 00:59:04.421
The Horseman does not kill at random.

476
00:59:04.743 --> 00:59:07.620
His victims are chosen
by someone who controls him.

477
00:59:08.079 --> 00:59:10.539
By that very person who took his skull.

478
00:59:11.374 --> 00:59:13.125
Someone who knew where to dig.

479
00:59:13.209 --> 00:59:14.824
Someone of flesh and blood,

480
00:59:15.038 --> 00:59:16.416
as I've always said.

481
00:59:16.796 --> 00:59:18.006
These are ravings.

482
00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:20.145
Drink.

483
01:00:32.038 --> 01:00:33.631
You were dreaming.
Yes.

484
01:00:35.291 --> 01:00:36.818
Things I had forgotten.

485
01:00:40.755 --> 01:00:42.510
And would not like to remember.

486
01:00:42.924 --> 01:00:44.730
Tell me what you dreamt.

487
01:00:45.468 --> 01:00:47.130
My mother was an innocent.

488
01:00:47.344 --> 01:00:48.775
A child of nature.

489
01:00:50.932 --> 01:00:52.275
Condemned.

490
01:00:53.977 --> 01:00:55.046
Murdered.

491
01:00:55.070 --> 01:00:56.491
By my father.

492
01:00:57.313 --> 01:00:59.849
Murdered by...
Murdered to save her soul,

493
01:01:01.317 --> 01:01:03.073
by a Bible-black tyrant,

494
01:01:03.287 --> 01:01:05.300
behind a mask of righteousness.

495
01:01:06.948 --> 01:01:10.200
I was seven when I lost my faith.

496
01:01:12.537 --> 01:01:14.188
What do you believe in?

497
01:01:14.831 --> 01:01:16.283
Sense and reason.

498
01:01:16.597 --> 01:01:18.246
Cause and consequence.

499
01:01:21.212 --> 01:01:23.105
I should not have come to this place,

500
01:01:23.798 --> 01:01:27.142
where my rational mind has been
so controverted by the spirit world.

501
01:01:27.385 --> 01:01:29.011
Will you take nothing
from Sleepy Hollow

502
01:01:29.095 --> 01:01:30.754
that was worth the coming here?

503
01:01:33.391 --> 01:01:34.391
No.

504
01:01:34.645 --> 01:01:36.164
No, not nothing.

505
01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:41.523
A kiss from a lovely young woman,

506
01:01:42.525 --> 01:01:44.818
before she saw my face
or knew my name.

507
01:01:45.111 --> 01:01:48.322
Yes, without sense or reason.

508
01:01:52.118 --> 01:01:55.621
Forgive me, I speak of kisses

509
01:01:56.706 --> 01:01:59.041
and you've lost your brave man, Brom.

510
01:02:00.335 --> 01:02:02.499
I have shed my tears for Brom,

511
01:02:03.213 --> 01:02:05.493
and yet my heart is not broken.

512
01:02:07.550 --> 01:02:09.321
Do you think me wicked?

513
01:02:10.035 --> 01:02:11.035
No.

514
01:02:12.597 --> 01:02:15.341
But perhaps there is a bit
of a witch in you, Katrina.

515
01:02:16.518 --> 01:02:17.990
Why do you say that?

516
01:02:18.704 --> 01:02:20.817
Because you have bewitched me.

517
01:02:35.745 --> 01:02:37.580
You slept like the dead.

518
01:02:37.794 --> 01:02:39.528
You're too kind to me.

519
01:02:39.958 --> 01:02:42.292
I do not look to be served
by the lady of the house.

520
01:02:42.377 --> 01:02:43.897
Nor would you be,

521
01:02:44.711 --> 01:02:46.793
but that the servant girl has vanished.

522
01:02:46.923 --> 01:02:47.903
Sarah?

523
01:02:47.927 --> 01:02:50.897
Run away like so many others.

524
01:02:51.469 --> 01:02:53.428
They're all leaving in fear.

525
01:02:55.098 --> 01:02:56.590
Where is Katrina?

526
01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:59.577
She watched over you till dawn.

527
01:02:59.691 --> 01:03:01.700
Now it is her turn to sleep.

528
01:03:07.652 --> 01:03:10.612
Well, I'm fit for another day, I think.

529
01:03:12.657 --> 01:03:15.292
Fit enough to face a mortal adversary.

530
01:03:17.495 --> 01:03:19.047
Doctor Lancaster,

531
01:03:19.661 --> 01:03:21.386
Reverend Steenwyck,

532
01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:26.044
Notary Hardenbrook,

533
01:03:26.358 --> 01:03:28.935
and Magistrate Philipse.

534
01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:33.427
Who tried to cut and run,
and lost his head.

535
01:03:34.345 --> 01:03:35.981
All frightened men,

536
01:03:36.082 --> 01:03:39.125
arguing together on the very night
Magistrate Philipse was killed.

537
01:03:41.769 --> 01:03:43.979
There is conspiracy here.

538
01:03:48.234 --> 01:03:51.612
The doctor, the reverend, the notary,

539
01:03:52.155 --> 01:03:53.947
and the magistrate.

540
01:03:55.825 --> 01:03:58.452
What is this secret that unites them?

541
01:04:01.789 --> 01:04:05.042
Magistrate Philipse knew
there were five bodies to four graves.

542
01:04:06.502 --> 01:04:08.879
He knew the Widow was pregnant.

543
01:04:09.839 --> 01:04:12.382
He would not tell me
the name of the father.

544
01:04:13.259 --> 01:04:15.552
What does this point to?

545
01:04:22.936 --> 01:04:25.771
We must proceed
by a process of elimination.

546
01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:29.232
I shall make a list of every man
and woman in Sleepy Hollow,

547
01:04:29.317 --> 01:04:32.478
starting with its chief citizen,
Baltus Van Tassel.

548
01:04:35.740 --> 01:04:37.783
I feel we're getting very close.

549
01:04:37.867 --> 01:04:41.495
Yes, I suppose
Baltus is the chief citizen,

550
01:04:41.537 --> 01:04:43.622
now that old Van Garrett is dead.

551
01:04:43.790 --> 01:04:44.999
Yes,

552
01:04:45.213 --> 01:04:46.583
the Van Garretts.

553
01:04:46.797 --> 01:04:48.653
I'd almost forgotten them.

554
01:05:00.682 --> 01:05:01.857
Come with me.

555
01:05:02.183 --> 01:05:03.183
Where?

556
01:05:03.270 --> 01:05:04.389
To Notary Hardenbrook's.

557
01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:05.959
Have you thought of something?

558
01:05:06.372 --> 01:05:07.372
Yes.

559
01:05:08.332 --> 01:05:09.624
I have.

560
01:05:24.706 --> 01:05:26.048
Hopeless.

561
01:05:35.133 --> 01:05:36.619
My father's satchel.

562
01:05:38.133 --> 01:05:39.741
Why is it here?

563
01:05:43.933 --> 01:05:44.697
Leave me alone.

564
01:05:44.811 --> 01:05:45.780
Notary Hardenbrook.

565
01:05:45.810 --> 01:05:47.769
Leave me alone!

566
01:05:47.854 --> 01:05:50.188
Just as soon as you show me
the last will and testament

567
01:05:50.273 --> 01:05:51.940
of old man Van Garrett.

568
01:05:52.108 --> 01:05:54.943
The will leaves everything to his son.

569
01:05:54.986 --> 01:05:56.265
Who died with him.

570
01:05:56.289 --> 01:05:59.295
So the estate passes to the next of kin.

571
01:05:59.365 --> 01:06:00.387
Naturally.

572
01:06:00.411 --> 01:06:02.432
All legal and above board.

573
01:06:02.646 --> 01:06:03.646
Sir.

574
01:06:05.872 --> 01:06:07.665
I'm a dead man. No.

575
01:06:10.168 --> 01:06:12.828
Van Garrett's seal. Broken.

576
01:06:15.798 --> 01:06:18.617
Seems Van Garrett
made a new will just before he died.

577
01:06:18.801 --> 01:06:19.840
Naming...

578
01:06:21.954 --> 01:06:23.151
Widow Winship?

579
01:06:23.464 --> 01:06:24.763
And here, look.

580
01:06:25.377 --> 01:06:26.954
A marriage certificate.

581
01:06:29.270 --> 01:06:31.646
Old Van Garrett
secretly married the Widow.

582
01:06:31.689 --> 01:06:34.691
Left everything to her
and her unborn child.

583
01:06:35.693 --> 01:06:38.862
So the new will
stood between the Van Garrett fortune

584
01:06:38.946 --> 01:06:41.690
and the person who would have
otherwise inherited everything.

585
01:06:42.033 --> 01:06:43.132
It's true.

586
01:06:43.246 --> 01:06:46.841
But we four were drawn
in against our will.

587
01:06:47.246 --> 01:06:48.251
Your will?

588
01:06:48.275 --> 01:06:49.594
He means...

589
01:06:49.999 --> 01:06:51.081
Of course.

590
01:06:52.195 --> 01:06:53.773
The four town elders.

591
01:06:54.170 --> 01:06:56.638
Now I see what parts you had to play.

592
01:06:58.091 --> 01:07:01.310
Reverend Steenwyck knew the secret
because he performed the marriage.

593
01:07:01.552 --> 01:07:04.346
Dr. Lancaster attended
the pregnant woman.

594
01:07:04.764 --> 01:07:07.499
Magistrate Philipse
gave protection of the law.

595
01:07:07.850 --> 01:07:10.519
And Notary Hardenbrook
concealed the documents,

596
01:07:10.895 --> 01:07:14.172
which had been entrusted
by Van Garrett to his faithful servant.

597
01:07:14.357 --> 01:07:17.192
The four conspirators
drawn into the plot.

598
01:07:17.610 --> 01:07:20.695
We did not know
it was a murdering plot.

599
01:07:20.738 --> 01:07:22.781
But I have not finished, sir.

600
01:07:23.032 --> 01:07:26.368
First, the Van Garretts, father and son,
slain by a horseman

601
01:07:26.452 --> 01:07:28.411
raised from the grave to chop heads.

602
01:07:28.496 --> 01:07:31.264
Now, up pops a widow
with a claim on a fortune.

603
01:07:31.288 --> 01:07:32.387
Off with her head!

604
01:07:33.042 --> 01:07:35.210
But murder begets murder.

605
01:07:35.837 --> 01:07:37.385
It was the servant,

606
01:07:37.599 --> 01:07:38.860
Jonathan Masbath.

607
01:07:39.715 --> 01:07:42.617
The night father and son
quarreled over the new will,

608
01:07:42.885 --> 01:07:45.971
Jonathan Masbath was summoned
upstairs to bear witness.

609
01:07:46.806 --> 01:07:48.557
Here is his signature.

610
01:07:48.599 --> 01:07:51.393
I'm afraid it was his death warrant,
young Masbath.

611
01:07:51.477 --> 01:07:53.812
The Horseman came for him.

612
01:07:55.064 --> 01:07:58.942
Came for him at the bidding of
someone who had power over him.

613
01:07:59.318 --> 01:08:02.529
Someone who dug in the earth in
the Western Woods and stole the skull.

614
01:08:02.572 --> 01:08:05.157
The missing head, which must
be restored to the Horseman

615
01:08:05.241 --> 01:08:07.159
before he will return to Hell.

616
01:08:07.368 --> 01:08:10.203
Someone who stood to gain
or lose a fortune.

617
01:08:10.705 --> 01:08:13.466
None other than Van Garrett's next of kin,

618
01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:15.680
Baltus Van Tassel!

619
01:08:21.883 --> 01:08:23.103
Katrina?

620
01:08:23.417 --> 01:08:24.886
Why are you in my room?

621
01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:26.587
Because it is yours.

622
01:08:30.474 --> 01:08:32.007
Was it wicked of me?

623
01:08:32.421 --> 01:08:34.449
No. No, not at all.

624
01:08:36.314 --> 01:08:37.213
I missed you.

625
01:08:37.237 --> 01:08:38.494
Where did you go?

626
01:08:38.566 --> 01:08:39.690
To the notary.

627
01:08:39.904 --> 01:08:41.681
I had questions to ask Hardenbrook.

628
01:08:41.944 --> 01:08:44.021
And did you learn anything of interest?

629
01:08:46.574 --> 01:08:47.849
Perhaps.

630
01:08:48.743 --> 01:08:50.485
My father...
Your father?

631
01:08:51.037 --> 01:08:54.956
Yes. My father thinks
you should return to New York.

632
01:08:55.082 --> 01:08:56.206
Really?

633
01:08:57.320 --> 01:08:58.506
Why is that?

634
01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:00.229
I don't know.

635
01:09:00.963 --> 01:09:03.782
Perhaps he looked in your ledger
and did not like what he saw.

636
01:09:09.931 --> 01:09:11.179
What have you there?

637
01:09:11.293 --> 01:09:13.988
Evidence.
I'm sorry, I must ask you...

638
01:09:14.060 --> 01:09:16.111
Then I'll leave you to your thoughts.

639
01:09:30.826 --> 01:09:32.330
It's just a spider.

640
01:09:32.354 --> 01:09:35.101
Kill it! Kill it!
No, no, stomp it!

641
01:09:37.583 --> 01:09:39.968
There's something under here.
What is it?

642
01:09:42.129 --> 01:09:44.371
Help me move the bed.
No, no, I mustn't.

643
01:09:44.395 --> 01:09:45.395
You do it.

644
01:09:51.931 --> 01:09:53.140
The evil eye.

645
01:09:53.754 --> 01:09:56.481
It is someone casting spells against you.

646
01:09:58.562 --> 01:10:00.355
The evil eye?

647
01:10:51.490 --> 01:10:52.833
Wait here.

648
01:12:08.484 --> 01:12:09.541
Katrina,

649
01:12:12.155 --> 01:12:13.947
you took the evidence and burned it.

650
01:12:13.989 --> 01:12:16.491
So you would not have it
to accuse my father.

651
01:12:16.575 --> 01:12:18.326
I accuse no one.

652
01:12:18.411 --> 01:12:20.286
But if there is guilt, I cannot alter it,

653
01:12:20.329 --> 01:12:21.871
no matter how much it grieves me.

654
01:12:21.956 --> 01:12:24.499
And no spells of
yours can alter it, either.

655
01:12:24.542 --> 01:12:26.042
Your father has the motive.

656
01:12:26.127 --> 01:12:28.336
It is he who stands to profit
from these murders.

657
01:12:28.379 --> 01:12:32.006
If you knew him, you would not have
such harsh thoughts about him.

658
01:12:32.258 --> 01:12:34.300
No, nor if you felt anything for me.

659
01:12:34.343 --> 01:12:36.136
I am pinioned by a chain of reasoning.

660
01:12:36.178 --> 01:12:38.430
Why else did his four friends
conspire to conceal...

661
01:12:38.514 --> 01:12:40.148
You are the constable, not I.

662
01:12:40.391 --> 01:12:43.017
So find another chain of reasoning
and let me be.

663
01:12:43.060 --> 01:12:44.190
I cannot,

664
01:12:44.304 --> 01:12:45.912
not the one or the other.

665
01:12:46.026 --> 01:12:48.007
And I am heartsick with it.

666
01:12:48.315 --> 01:12:50.144
I think you have no heart.

667
01:12:50.958 --> 01:12:52.840
And I had a mind once to give you mine.

668
01:12:53.988 --> 01:12:54.988
Yes,

669
01:12:56.119 --> 01:12:59.021
I think you loved me that day when you
followed me into the Western Woods

670
01:12:59.335 --> 01:13:00.815
to have braved such peril.

671
01:13:00.986 --> 01:13:02.478
What peril was there for me,

672
01:13:02.563 --> 01:13:05.240
if it was my own father who controlled
the Headless Horseman?

673
01:13:10.463 --> 01:13:11.921
Goodbye, Ichabod Crane.

674
01:13:12.006 --> 01:13:14.674
I curse the day
you came to Sleepy Hollow.

675
01:13:19.597 --> 01:13:24.184
She will not see you.
Did she say anything?

676
01:13:26.604 --> 01:13:28.638
Only that she will not come down.

677
01:13:30.065 --> 01:13:32.050
I see. Thank you.

678
01:13:32.401 --> 01:13:33.935
Constable?

679
01:13:35.654 --> 01:13:39.407
You have not asked me how
I have hurt my hand since yesterday,

680
01:13:40.367 --> 01:13:42.243
which would have been polite.

681
01:13:43.913 --> 01:13:46.247
In fact, you have been as careful,

682
01:13:46.624 --> 01:13:47.969
not to look at it,

683
01:13:48.383 --> 01:13:50.215
as not to mention it.

684
01:13:52.046 --> 01:13:53.339
Yes, I'm sorry.

685
01:13:53.553 --> 01:13:54.645
How did you...

686
01:13:54.715 --> 01:13:56.746
I know you saw me.

687
01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:58.205
What?

688
01:13:58.844 --> 01:14:01.554
I know you followed last night.

689
01:14:01.972 --> 01:14:05.141
And you must promise
not to tell my husband what you saw.

690
01:14:05.518 --> 01:14:06.935
Promise me!

691
01:14:07.770 --> 01:14:09.771
The town is in ferment.

692
01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:13.066
Horror piled on tragedy.
Hardenbrook is dead.

693
01:14:13.108 --> 01:14:14.047
Oh, no!

694
01:14:14.071 --> 01:14:15.265
That harmless old man?

695
01:14:15.289 --> 01:14:16.922
Hanged himself in the night.

696
01:14:16.946 --> 01:14:18.112
Hanged himself?

697
01:14:18.197 --> 01:14:20.907
Reverend Steenwyck's
called a meeting in the church tonight.

698
01:14:20.950 --> 01:14:24.536
Every man, woman, and child
is going to speak out against you.

699
01:14:24.620 --> 01:14:27.455
If you are wise, you will leave this place.

700
01:14:29.041 --> 01:14:30.011
What is that?

701
01:14:30.035 --> 01:14:32.974
I was careless with the kitchen knife.

702
01:14:33.003 --> 01:14:34.754
The wound looks angry.

703
01:14:34.797 --> 01:14:38.299
I will bind it later
with wild arrowroot flowers.

704
01:14:38.384 --> 01:14:40.176
I know where some grow.

705
01:14:50.396 --> 01:14:53.690
Come on, hurry up.
The meeting bell started tolling.

706
01:15:18.090 --> 01:15:19.507
The Horseman!

707
01:15:21.093 --> 01:15:22.427
Katrina!
Father?

708
01:15:22.511 --> 01:15:24.546
The Horseman! Save me!

709
01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:30.018
He killed her.
The Horseman killed your stepmother.

710
01:15:39.028 --> 01:15:40.495
Oh, God!

711
01:15:52.249 --> 01:15:54.208
Fire!

712
01:16:10.726 --> 01:16:12.131
You'll kill us all!

713
01:16:12.155 --> 01:16:14.400
You're the one the Horseman wants.

714
01:16:35.250 --> 01:16:36.743
He cannot enter.

715
01:16:37.086 --> 01:16:38.711
Over here!

716
01:16:46.929 --> 01:16:47.969
The Horseman cannot enter.

717
01:16:48.013 --> 01:16:49.389
Why should we die for you?

718
01:16:49.431 --> 01:16:51.766
The Horseman cannot enter.
He cannot cross the gate.

719
01:16:51.850 --> 01:16:53.702
We have to save ourselves.

720
01:16:55.312 --> 01:16:58.481
The next person that lays a hand on me
will get a bullet!

721
01:17:00.818 --> 01:17:02.343
He's coming back!

722
01:17:09.618 --> 01:17:10.962
Enough have died already.

723
01:17:10.986 --> 01:17:12.717
It's time to confess our sins.

724
01:17:12.788 --> 01:17:14.140
What is it that you know?

725
01:17:14.164 --> 01:17:16.178
Your four friends played you false.

726
01:17:16.250 --> 01:17:18.710
We were devilishly possessed
by one who...

727
01:17:27.344 --> 01:17:28.842
Get out of my way!

728
01:17:29.056 --> 01:17:31.318
Stand back! Stay back!

729
01:17:41.608 --> 01:17:42.608
Back!

730
01:17:43.193 --> 01:17:44.482
Stand back!

731
01:17:49.074 --> 01:17:52.469
There is a conspiracy here,
and I will shake it out.

732
01:19:08.737 --> 01:19:10.947
It was an evil spirit possessed you.

733
01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:15.117
I pray God it is satisfied now,
and that you find peace.

734
01:19:15.202 --> 01:19:17.078
The evil eye's done its work.

735
01:19:17.496 --> 01:19:19.115
My life is over,

736
01:19:19.529 --> 01:19:22.221
spared for a lifetime
of horrors in my sleep,

737
01:19:23.252 --> 01:19:25.253
waking each day to grief.

738
01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:33.261
Goodbye, Katrina.

739
01:20:11.466 --> 01:20:13.712
You think it was Katrina, don't you?

740
01:20:13.826 --> 01:20:15.649
That can never be uttered.

741
01:20:15.721 --> 01:20:19.140
A strange sort of witch,
with a kind and loving heart.

742
01:20:19.224 --> 01:20:21.726
How can you think so?
I have good reason.

743
01:20:21.810 --> 01:20:25.104
Then you are bewitched by reason.
I am beaten down by it!

744
01:20:30.652 --> 01:20:32.153
It is a hard lesson for a hard world,

745
01:20:32.195 --> 01:20:34.363
and you had better learn it,
young Masbath.

746
01:20:34.448 --> 01:20:36.324
Villainy wears many masks.

747
01:20:36.491 --> 01:20:39.452
None so dangerous
as the mask of virtue.

748
01:20:47.544 --> 01:20:48.803
Farewell.

749
01:22:19.011 --> 01:22:20.553
Van Ripper, turn the coach.
What?

750
01:22:20.595 --> 01:22:21.938
Turn around now!

751
01:22:35.777 --> 01:22:37.278
Pardon my intrusion.

752
01:22:47.998 --> 01:22:51.792
No blood flow, no clotting, no healing.

753
01:22:54.713 --> 01:22:56.342
When this cut was made,

754
01:22:56.756 --> 01:22:58.279
this woman was already dead.

755
01:23:09.061 --> 01:23:10.728
Dear stepdaughter,

756
01:23:13.023 --> 01:23:15.191
you look as if you'd seen a ghost.

757
01:23:46.807 --> 01:23:50.518
Rise up once more, my dark avenger.

758
01:23:50.769 --> 01:23:53.320
One more night of beheading.

759
01:23:53.434 --> 01:23:55.402
Rise up with your sword.

760
01:23:56.108 --> 01:23:59.693
A head for a head.

761
01:23:59.861 --> 01:24:02.780
My unholy horseman, rise!

762
01:24:03.615 --> 01:24:07.785
Come now for Katrina!

763
01:24:21.133 --> 01:24:23.050
Awake at last.

764
01:24:24.052 --> 01:24:26.971
Did you think it was all a nasty dream?

765
01:24:27.055 --> 01:24:29.140
Father saw the Horseman kill you.

766
01:24:29.558 --> 01:24:33.394
He saw the Horseman come
towards me with his sword unsheathed,

767
01:24:33.812 --> 01:24:37.231
but it is I who govern
the Horseman, my dear.

768
01:24:37.566 --> 01:24:40.067
And Baltus did not stay to watch.

769
01:24:44.573 --> 01:24:46.128
But there was a body.

770
01:24:46.152 --> 01:24:48.088
The servant girl, Sarah.

771
01:24:48.118 --> 01:24:50.494
And I always thought she was useless.

772
01:24:53.957 --> 01:24:56.792
But it seems
she had a purpose after all.

773
01:25:02.048 --> 01:25:03.799
Who are you?

774
01:25:04.426 --> 01:25:07.679
My family name was Archer.

775
01:25:07.993 --> 01:25:09.618
The archer.

776
01:25:16.146 --> 01:25:20.441
I lived with my father and mother
and sister in a cottage not far from here.

777
01:25:20.483 --> 01:25:22.359
Until one day my father died,

778
01:25:22.444 --> 01:25:25.613
and the landlord, who had received
many years of loyal service

779
01:25:25.697 --> 01:25:27.740
from my parents, evicted us.

780
01:25:28.283 --> 01:25:30.951
No one in this God-fearing town
would take us in

781
01:25:31.036 --> 01:25:33.871
because my mother
was suspected of witchcraft.

782
01:25:34.623 --> 01:25:36.498
But she schooled her daughters well,

783
01:25:36.583 --> 01:25:39.752
while we lived as outcasts
in the Western Woods.

784
01:25:40.503 --> 01:25:43.088
She died within a year.

785
01:25:48.011 --> 01:25:50.708
My sister and I remained in our refuge,

786
01:25:51.222 --> 01:25:52.861
seeing not a soul.

787
01:25:53.516 --> 01:25:54.883
Until one day,

788
01:25:55.697 --> 01:25:57.532
whilst gathering firewood,

789
01:25:57.604 --> 01:26:00.189
we crossed the path of the Hessian.

790
01:26:05.946 --> 01:26:07.780
I saw his death.

791
01:26:08.323 --> 01:26:12.243
At that moment,
I offered my soul to Satan,

792
01:26:12.327 --> 01:26:16.830
if he would raise the Hessian
from the grave to avenge me.

793
01:26:21.336 --> 01:26:22.271
Avenge you?

794
01:26:22.295 --> 01:26:24.184
Against Van Garrett.

795
01:26:24.381 --> 01:26:27.591
The landlord who showed us no mercy
and left us to starve,

796
01:26:27.676 --> 01:26:29.164
whilst Baltus Van Tassel,

797
01:26:29.188 --> 01:26:33.013
and his simpering wife
and girl child stole our home.

798
01:26:33.181 --> 01:26:36.308
I swore I would make myself
mistress of all he had.

799
01:26:36.351 --> 01:26:38.644
The easiest part was the first.

800
01:26:38.728 --> 01:26:41.397
To enter your house
as your mother's sick nurse,

801
01:26:41.481 --> 01:26:45.693
and put her body into the grave
and my own into the marriage bed.

802
01:26:46.111 --> 01:26:49.363
Not quite so easy
was to secure my legacy.

803
01:26:49.990 --> 01:26:52.533
The Widow had to go, of course.

804
01:26:53.243 --> 01:26:55.077
And the servant, Masbath.

805
01:26:55.370 --> 01:26:58.706
And then, just the other day,
that silly midwife Killian

806
01:26:58.790 --> 01:27:02.167
told me the Widow had told her
a big secret.

807
01:27:02.210 --> 01:27:05.379
And she told me this
right in front of her husband.

808
01:27:05.630 --> 01:27:06.880
What a goose!

809
01:27:08.341 --> 01:27:10.634
So, another little job for the Horseman.

810
01:27:13.847 --> 01:27:18.767
But lust delivered
the Reverend Steenwyck into my power.

811
01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:23.105
Fear did the same
for the notary, Hardenbrook,

812
01:27:23.189 --> 01:27:24.898
and the drunkard Philipse.

813
01:27:25.358 --> 01:27:28.027
And the doctor's silence I exchanged

814
01:27:28.069 --> 01:27:33.073
for my complicity in his fornications
with the servant girl, Sarah.

815
01:27:33.742 --> 01:27:36.928
Yes, you have everything now.
No.

816
01:27:37.746 --> 01:27:41.373
You have my dear, by your father's will.

817
01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:45.044
I get everything
in the event of your death.

818
01:27:46.838 --> 01:27:48.874
My sister by the way,

819
01:27:49.688 --> 01:27:51.421
sadly passed away.

820
01:27:53.803 --> 01:27:55.429
Quite recently.

821
01:27:57.766 --> 01:27:59.808
You killed your own sister?

822
01:27:59.934 --> 01:28:01.875
She brought it on herself,

823
01:28:02.689 --> 01:28:04.351
by helping you and your master.

824
01:28:06.775 --> 01:28:09.610
You're just in time
to have your head cut off.

825
01:28:09.944 --> 01:28:11.550
The Horseman comes!

826
01:28:11.574 --> 01:28:13.894
And tonight, he comes for you!

827
01:28:20.372 --> 01:28:21.547
Katrina!

828
01:28:28.004 --> 01:28:29.221
Thank God.

829
01:28:38.348 --> 01:28:39.707
Watch your head.

830
01:28:55.990 --> 01:28:57.625
To the roof! I have an idea.

831
01:29:58.094 --> 01:29:59.420
Jump for the sails.

832
01:30:15.069 --> 01:30:16.320
Jump!

833
01:30:22.035 --> 01:30:23.118
Hurry!

834
01:30:43.431 --> 01:30:45.849
Is he dead?
That's the problem.

835
01:30:45.934 --> 01:30:47.643
He was dead to begin with.

836
01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.993
Where are we going?
Anywhere but here.

837
01:31:26.599 --> 01:31:28.041
Here, take the reins.

838
01:31:48.496 --> 01:31:49.822
Ichabod!

839
01:32:45.887 --> 01:32:47.120
My bag!

840
01:33:04.822 --> 01:33:05.989
Jump!

841
01:34:09.220 --> 01:34:11.246
Still alive?
Run, Katrina.

842
01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:16.476
Yes, do run, and jump, and skip.

843
01:34:18.980 --> 01:34:20.147
No!

844
01:34:28.865 --> 01:34:31.825
Here! Take her!

845
01:34:32.326 --> 01:34:34.661
She's yours!

846
01:34:37.373 --> 01:34:40.083
Sir, you're not dead.

847
01:35:21.626 --> 01:35:22.859
Horseman!

848
01:38:55.631 --> 01:38:57.924
Just in time for a new century.

849
01:39:10.896 --> 01:39:12.939
You'll soon get your bearings,
young Masbath.

850
01:39:12.982 --> 01:39:15.358
The Bronx is up, the Battery's down,

851
01:39:15.443 --> 01:39:17.343
and home is this way.

852
01:39:38.767 --> 01:39:41.167
