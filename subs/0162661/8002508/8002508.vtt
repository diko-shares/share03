1
00:04:02.917 --> 00:04:06.624
Help here! Lend a hand here! Anyone!

2
00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.040
Constable Crane?

3
00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:11.958
Ichabod Crane, is that you?

4
00:04:12.041 --> 00:04:13.374
None other.

5
00:04:14.083 --> 00:04:15.374
Not only me.

6
00:04:15.417 --> 00:04:19.374
I have found something,
which was lately a man.

7
00:04:23.417 --> 00:04:25.583
- Burn it.
- Yes, sir.

8
00:04:27.041 --> 00:04:29.666
Just a moment, if I may.
We do not yet know the cause of death.

9
00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.249
When you find them in the river,
cause of death is drowning.

10
00:04:33.333 --> 00:04:34.958
Possibly so,
if there is water in the lungs,

11
00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:38.166
but by pathology we might be able to
determine whether or not he was dead

12
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.457
before he went into the river.

13
00:04:39.542 --> 00:04:41.583
I will need to examine the body.

14
00:04:41.667 --> 00:04:44.583
Cut him up. Are we heathens?

15
00:04:46.417 --> 00:04:47.499
What happened to him?

16
00:04:47.584 --> 00:04:49.833
Nothing, sir. Arrested for burglary.

17
00:04:57.834 --> 00:04:58.958
Good work.

18
00:05:00.125 --> 00:05:02.291
The millennium is almost upon us.

19
00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.207
In a few months,
we will be living in the 19th century,

20
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.749
yet our courts continue
to rely on medieval devices of torture.

21
00:05:09.792 --> 00:05:10.916
Stand down!

22
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.082
I stand up for sense and justice.

23
00:05:14.167 --> 00:05:16.374
Our jails overflow with men and women

24
00:05:16.417 --> 00:05:18.541
convicted on confessions
worth no more than this one.

25
00:05:18.584 --> 00:05:19.958
Constable Crane!

26
00:05:21.125 --> 00:05:24.916
This is a song that we have heard
from you more than once.

27
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.749
Now, there are two courses open to me.

28
00:05:28.792 --> 00:05:32.749
First, I can let you cool your heels
in the cells

29
00:05:32.834 --> 00:05:35.916
until you learn respect
for the dignity of my office.

30
00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:37.541
I beg pardon.

31
00:05:37.584 --> 00:05:41.207
But why am I the only one
who sees that, to solve crimes,

32
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.583
to detect the guilty,
we must use our brains

33
00:05:44.667 --> 00:05:49.249
to recognize vital clues,
using up-to-date scientific techniques?

34
00:05:49.333 --> 00:05:52.457
Which brings me to the second course.

35
00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.166
There is a town upstate,
two days' journey to the north

36
00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.166
in the Hudson Highlands.

37
00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.000
It is a place called Sleepy Hollow.

38
00:06:03.876 --> 00:06:05.416
Have you heard of it?

39
00:06:05.834 --> 00:06:06.916
I have not.

40
00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:10.666
An isolated farming community,
mainly Dutch.

41
00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:15.207
Three persons have been
murdered there, all within a fortnight.

42
00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:20.082
Each one found
with the head lopped off.

43
00:06:20.167 --> 00:06:21.583
Lopped off?

44
00:06:21.625 --> 00:06:24.624
Clean as dandelion heads, apparently.

45
00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.875
You will take
these experimentations of yours

46
00:06:28.917 --> 00:06:30.749
to Sleepy Hollow

47
00:06:30.834 --> 00:06:34.541
and there you will detect the murderer.

48
00:06:34.584 --> 00:06:38.416
Bring him here to face our good justice.

49
00:06:39.792 --> 00:06:41.166
Will you do this?

50
00:06:42.584 --> 00:06:43.708
I shall.

51
00:06:44.625 --> 00:06:47.749
Remember, it is you,

52
00:06:47.792 --> 00:06:50.332
Ichabod Crane,

53
00:06:50.417 --> 00:06:53.666
who is now put to the test.

54
00:11:57.542 --> 00:12:00.541
"The Pickety Witch, the Pickety Witch

55
00:12:00.584 --> 00:12:02.624
"Who's got a kiss for the Pickety Witch?

56
00:12:02.709 --> 00:12:05.040
"The Pickety Witch, the Pickety Witch

57
00:12:05.083 --> 00:12:07.916
"Who's got a kiss
for the Pickety Witch?"

58
00:12:09.959 --> 00:12:11.416
Is it Theodore?

59
00:12:11.458 --> 00:12:13.583
No, pardon, miss. I am only a stranger.

60
00:12:13.625 --> 00:12:15.457
Then have a kiss on account.

61
00:12:23.083 --> 00:12:26.249
I'm looking for Baltus Van Tassel.

62
00:12:26.292 --> 00:12:29.000
I'm his daughter, Katrina Van Tassel.

63
00:12:29.083 --> 00:12:31.666
And who are you, friend?
We have not heard your name yet.

64
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:34.166
I've not said it. Excuse me.

65
00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:36.916
- You need some manners.
- Brom.

66
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.207
Come, come.
We'll have no raised voices.

67
00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:42.082
It is only to raise spirits
during this dark time

68
00:12:42.167 --> 00:12:46.249
that I and my dear wife
are giving this little party.

69
00:12:46.333 --> 00:12:50.249
Young sir, you are most welcome,
even if you are selling something.

70
00:12:50.292 --> 00:12:51.916
Thank you, sir.

71
00:12:51.959 --> 00:12:55.332
I am Constable Ichabod Crane,
sent to you from New York

72
00:12:55.417 --> 00:12:57.291
to investigate murder in Sleepy Hollow.

73
00:12:57.375 --> 00:13:00.916
Then Sleepy Hollow
is grateful to you, Constable Crane.

74
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.040
And we hope you will honor us
by remaining in this house.

75
00:13:04.083 --> 00:13:05.624
Well spoke, dear.

76
00:13:05.709 --> 00:13:08.833
Come, sir, we'll get you settled. Play on!

77
00:13:15.709 --> 00:13:17.249
Excuse me, please.

78
00:13:22.584 --> 00:13:23.916
Thank you.

79
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.875
Please tell Mr. Van Tassel
I will be down in a moment.

80
00:13:26.917 --> 00:13:28.166
I will, sir.

81
00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:33.583
Thank God you're here.

82
00:13:45.667 --> 00:13:48.666
Excellent. Come in. Leave us, my dear.

83
00:13:52.792 --> 00:13:55.916
We are joined by
Dr. Thomas Lancaster,

84
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.583
Reverend Steenwyck,

85
00:13:57.667 --> 00:14:00.374
our able Magistrate Samuel Philipse,

86
00:14:00.417 --> 00:14:01.541
and lastly,

87
00:14:01.584 --> 00:14:05.875
this fine fellow is James Hardenbrook,
our notary.

88
00:14:05.917 --> 00:14:07.749
And you, sir?

89
00:14:07.834 --> 00:14:10.958
A simple farmer who has prospered.

90
00:14:11.041 --> 00:14:14.416
The town looks to me
as friend and counsel.

91
00:14:14.458 --> 00:14:17.416
And landlord and banker.
Can we proceed?

92
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:18.583
Thank you.

93
00:14:20.917 --> 00:14:22.000
So...

94
00:14:23.917 --> 00:14:26.457
Three persons murdered.

95
00:14:28.125 --> 00:14:30.958
First, Peter Van Garrett

96
00:14:31.792 --> 00:14:34.583
and his son, Dirk Van Garrett.

97
00:14:35.667 --> 00:14:39.875
Both of them strong, capable men,

98
00:14:40.917 --> 00:14:42.249
found together

99
00:14:43.584 --> 00:14:44.791
decapitated.

100
00:14:47.792 --> 00:14:50.000
One week later, the Widow Winship.

101
00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:54.457
Also decapitated.

102
00:14:56.792 --> 00:15:01.082
Now, I will need to ask you
many questions.

103
00:15:01.167 --> 00:15:05.583
But first, let me ask,
is anyone suspected?

104
00:15:09.584 --> 00:15:13.207
How much have your superiors
explained to you, Constable?

105
00:15:14.125 --> 00:15:18.624
Only that the three
were slain in open ground,

106
00:15:19.375 --> 00:15:22.749
their heads found severed
from their bodies.

107
00:15:23.208 --> 00:15:25.583
Their heads were not found severed.

108
00:15:25.667 --> 00:15:27.791
Their heads were not found at all.

109
00:15:30.792 --> 00:15:33.875
The heads are gone?

110
00:15:33.917 --> 00:15:35.124
Taken.

111
00:15:35.208 --> 00:15:38.124
Taken by the Headless Horseman.

112
00:15:38.208 --> 00:15:40.082
Taken back to hell.

113
00:15:41.625 --> 00:15:43.082
Pardon, I don't...

114
00:15:43.167 --> 00:15:45.749
Perhaps you had better sit down.

115
00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:49.416
Yes.

116
00:15:53.792 --> 00:15:56.541
The horseman was
a Hessian mercenary

117
00:15:56.584 --> 00:15:59.332
sent to these shores by German princes

118
00:15:59.417 --> 00:16:02.332
to keep Americans
under the yoke of England.

119
00:16:02.417 --> 00:16:06.457
But unlike his compatriots,
who came for money,

120
00:16:06.542 --> 00:16:10.207
the horseman came for love of carnage.

121
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:14.040
When battle was joined,
there you'd find him.

122
00:16:16.876 --> 00:16:20.332
He rode a giant black steed
named Daredevil.

123
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.416
He was infamous
for riding his horse hard into battle,

124
00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:29.040
chopping off heads at full gallop.

125
00:16:29.083 --> 00:16:32.708
He had filed his teeth
down to sharp points

126
00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:35.416
to add to the ferocity of his appearance.

127
00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:47.457
This butcher didn't finally reach his end

128
00:16:47.876 --> 00:16:50.082
until the winter of '79

129
00:16:51.959 --> 00:16:55.249
not far from here in our Western Woods.

130
00:17:49.542 --> 00:17:52.000
They chopped off his head
with his own sword.

131
00:17:52.083 --> 00:17:55.124
Even today,
the Western Woods is a haunted place

132
00:17:55.208 --> 00:17:57.416
where brave men will not venture.

133
00:17:59.834 --> 00:18:02.332
For what was planted
in the ground that day

134
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:05.374
was a seed of evil.

135
00:18:09.584 --> 00:18:11.916
And so it has been for 20 years.

136
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:14.499
But now the Hessian wakes.

137
00:18:14.917 --> 00:18:18.541
He's on the rampage,
cutting off heads where he finds them.

138
00:18:23.834 --> 00:18:25.708
Are you saying...

139
00:18:26.792 --> 00:18:28.541
Is that what you believe?

140
00:18:29.917 --> 00:18:32.332
Seeing is believing.

141
00:18:34.083 --> 00:18:38.749
They tell me that you've brought books
and trappings of scientific investigation.

142
00:18:39.125 --> 00:18:43.332
This is the only book
I recommend you read.

143
00:18:51.292 --> 00:18:52.583
I see.

144
00:18:54.083 --> 00:18:56.249
Reverend Steenwyck.

145
00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.082
Gentlemen.

146
00:18:59.709 --> 00:19:03.000
Murder needs no ghosts
to come from the grave.

147
00:19:03.083 --> 00:19:07.374
We have murders in New York
without benefit of ghouls and goblins.

148
00:19:07.417 --> 00:19:09.916
You're a long way
from New York, Constable.

149
00:19:10.375 --> 00:19:13.708
The assassin is
a man of flesh and blood

150
00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:15.583
and I will discover him.

151
00:19:56.333 --> 00:19:57.958
Come out, devil.

152
00:20:50.417 --> 00:20:51.916
His name's Gunpowder.

153
00:20:52.834 --> 00:20:55.082
He should do just fine, Mr. Killian.

154
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:56.875
Thank you.

155
00:20:57.417 --> 00:20:59.374
Good luck, sir.
If you need help, you call my name.

156
00:20:59.417 --> 00:21:00.875
Much appreciated.

157
00:21:01.417 --> 00:21:03.833
Now, don't you worry about a thing.

158
00:21:03.917 --> 00:21:06.040
Everything's going to be just fine.

159
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.666
Thomas! Inside!

160
00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:14.249
Run along for your breakfast.

161
00:21:14.292 --> 00:21:16.541
Kiss your mother
once for you and twice for me.

162
00:21:16.584 --> 00:21:19.583
Murder! The horseman's killed again!

163
00:21:21.375 --> 00:21:24.124
All right, Gunpowder, we're off.
Come on.

164
00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:26.166
No, no. Come on, the other way.

165
00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:27.749
No, no. Turn around.

166
00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:34.708
Good horsy.

167
00:21:46.584 --> 00:21:50.207
- Mr. Miller, ride back for the coffin cart.
- Yes, sir.

168
00:21:50.292 --> 00:21:52.583
The rest of you keep a sharp lookout.

169
00:21:54.625 --> 00:21:56.541
It's all right. I'm here now.

170
00:22:21.584 --> 00:22:24.082
The fourth victim, Jonathan Masbath.

171
00:22:27.458 --> 00:22:28.749
I see.

172
00:22:29.667 --> 00:22:31.791
And the head?

173
00:22:33.584 --> 00:22:36.666
Taken.

174
00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:40.666
Interesting. Very interesting.

175
00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:41.791
What is?

176
00:22:42.417 --> 00:22:45.666
In headless-corpse cases of this sort,
the head is removed

177
00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:47.541
to prevent identification of the body.

178
00:22:47.584 --> 00:22:50.624
But we know
this was Jonathan Masbath.

179
00:22:50.709 --> 00:22:53.082
Precisely. So why was
the head removed?

180
00:22:53.167 --> 00:22:54.332
- Why?
- Right.

181
00:22:57.417 --> 00:22:59.666
- You have moved the body?
- I did.

182
00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:02.541
- You must never move the body!
- Why not?

183
00:23:02.876 --> 00:23:03.958
Because.

184
00:23:18.792 --> 00:23:20.916
The stride is gigantic.

185
00:23:23.709 --> 00:23:25.666
The attacker rode Masbath down,

186
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.374
turned his horse,

187
00:23:29.709 --> 00:23:31.499
came back.

188
00:23:31.584 --> 00:23:33.499
Came back to claim the head.

189
00:23:51.417 --> 00:23:52.499
Yes.

190
00:23:53.584 --> 00:23:55.541
There's a chemical reaction.

191
00:23:55.584 --> 00:23:58.958
It shows there was a powerful,
singular thrust to the neck.

192
00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:28.541
- Interesting.
- What is it?

193
00:24:30.083 --> 00:24:32.624
The wound was cauterized
in the very instant,

194
00:24:34.417 --> 00:24:36.583
as though the blade itself were red hot.

195
00:24:36.667 --> 00:24:40.082
And yet, no blistering,
no scorched flesh.

196
00:24:42.167 --> 00:24:43.791
The Devil's fire.

197
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.124
"Be vigilant,"
as it sayeth in the Book of Peter,

198
00:24:54.208 --> 00:24:56.457
chapter five, verse eight.

199
00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:59.082
"Because your adversary the devil,

200
00:24:59.125 --> 00:25:02.374
"as a roaring lion, walketh about,

201
00:25:03.292 --> 00:25:05.499
"seeking whom he may devour."

202
00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:09.624
God rest Jonathan Masbath.

203
00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:12.624
Amen.

204
00:25:36.584 --> 00:25:38.082
Mr. Constable, sir.

205
00:25:39.484 --> 00:25:40.900
You're young Masbath.

206
00:25:41.983 --> 00:25:45.649
I was young Masbath,
but now the only one.

207
00:25:45.692 --> 00:25:47.733
Masbath, at your service.

208
00:25:47.817 --> 00:25:50.149
In honor bound to avenge my father.

209
00:25:50.983 --> 00:25:54.441
Well, one and only Masbath,
I thank you very much,

210
00:25:54.484 --> 00:25:57.357
but your mother will need you
more than I.

211
00:25:58.150 --> 00:25:59.982
My mother is in heaven, sir.

212
00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:03.274
She has my father now to care for her.

213
00:26:03.317 --> 00:26:07.733
But you have no one to serve you.
I am your man, sir.

214
00:26:07.817 --> 00:26:11.483
Yes, and a brave one, too. But I cannot
be the one to look after you.

215
00:26:13.859 --> 00:26:16.357
I'm sorry for your loss,
young Mr. Masbath.

216
00:26:29.317 --> 00:26:31.232
- Constable Crane.
- Mr. Philipse?

217
00:26:31.317 --> 00:26:33.024
Something you should know.

218
00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:36.357
Jonathan Masbath
was not the fourth victim,

219
00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:39.733
- but the fifth.
- The fifth?

220
00:26:39.817 --> 00:26:40.940
Aye.

221
00:26:41.358 --> 00:26:45.357
Five victims in four graves.

222
00:26:56.983 --> 00:26:58.316
Young Masbath.

223
00:26:59.067 --> 00:27:01.066
Find a place
in the Van Tassel's servants' quarters.

224
00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:02.649
Wake me before dawn.

225
00:27:02.941 --> 00:27:05.024
I hope you have a strong stomach.

226
00:27:07.609 --> 00:27:09.024
Peter Van Garrett.

227
00:27:10.108 --> 00:27:11.566
Dirk Van Garrett.

228
00:27:12.358 --> 00:27:13.858
Jonathan Masbath.

229
00:27:14.983 --> 00:27:18.441
There are five victims, four graves.

230
00:27:32.525 --> 00:27:34.982
The Widow Winship.

231
00:27:59.609 --> 00:28:01.066
Bring the Widow in.

232
00:28:03.358 --> 00:28:05.649
This is most irregular, Constable.

233
00:28:05.692 --> 00:28:08.524
I should hope so, Doctor,
but in this case, necessary.

234
00:28:08.609 --> 00:28:10.191
We need to operate immediately.

235
00:28:10.275 --> 00:28:13.107
Operate? She's dead.

236
00:28:13.941 --> 00:28:15.149
When we say "operate,"

237
00:28:15.192 --> 00:28:18.107
we mean, of course,
I will need the operating table.

238
00:28:21.609 --> 00:28:25.066
Once more, the neck wound cauterized.

239
00:28:27.567 --> 00:28:30.858
The sword thrust to the stomach,
the same.

240
00:28:30.941 --> 00:28:32.649
But to what purpose?

241
00:28:32.692 --> 00:28:35.107
To what is your purpose
is the question.

242
00:28:35.609 --> 00:28:38.816
What manner of instruments are these?

243
00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:40.483
Some of my own design.

244
00:28:42.317 --> 00:28:44.775
All right, then.
Step outside, young Masbath.

245
00:28:44.817 --> 00:28:46.858
Thank you very, very much
for your help, Mr. Killian.

246
00:28:46.941 --> 00:28:49.232
And if you don't mind, Doctor,

247
00:28:49.317 --> 00:28:52.608
my concentration suffers greatly
when I'm observed.

248
00:29:32.609 --> 00:29:33.858
I am finished.

249
00:29:34.067 --> 00:29:36.816
What in the name of God
have you done to her?

250
00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:39.357
We are dealing with a madman.

251
00:29:39.817 --> 00:29:41.816
What did you find out, Constable?

252
00:29:41.859 --> 00:29:44.274
The Widow Winship was with child.

253
00:30:06.983 --> 00:30:08.149
Ichabod.

254
00:30:09.442 --> 00:30:12.691
Ichabod. Ichabod.

255
00:30:13.983 --> 00:30:15.149
Ichabod.

256
00:30:30.317 --> 00:30:31.483
Who's there?

257
00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:44.982
Ichabod.

258
00:33:06.733 --> 00:33:09.400
Oh, pardon my intrusion. I saw a light.

259
00:33:09.483 --> 00:33:12.899
It is no intrusion.
I come here to read when I am wakeful.

260
00:33:17.817 --> 00:33:20.983
To read books which you must hide?

261
00:33:21.067 --> 00:33:23.816
They were my mother's books.
My father believes

262
00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:26.649
tales of romance caused the brain fever
that killed my mother.

263
00:33:26.733 --> 00:33:28.983
She died two years ago
come midwinter.

264
00:33:30.109 --> 00:33:31.857
The nurse who cared for her
during her sickness

265
00:33:31.942 --> 00:33:33.566
is now Lady Van Tassel.

266
00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:36.816
There was something else, too.

267
00:33:37.234 --> 00:33:39.024
Why did no one think to mention that

268
00:33:39.109 --> 00:33:42.108
the Van Garretts are kith and kin
to the Van Tassels?

269
00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:44.691
Why, because there is hardly
a household in Sleepy Hollow

270
00:33:44.775 --> 00:33:47.983
that is not connected
to every other by blood or marriage.

271
00:33:48.192 --> 00:33:49.316
I see.

272
00:33:54.483 --> 00:33:57.024
This land we're looking at
was Van Garrett land,

273
00:33:57.109 --> 00:33:59.857
given to my father
when I was in swaddling clothes.

274
00:33:59.942 --> 00:34:02.440
The Van Garretts were
the richest family around these parts.

275
00:34:02.483 --> 00:34:04.607
When my father brought us
to Sleepy Hollow,

276
00:34:04.650 --> 00:34:07.566
Van Garrett set him up with an acre
and a broken-down cottage.

277
00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:11.732
My father worked hard for his family,
and prospered and built this house.

278
00:34:11.817 --> 00:34:13.816
And I owe my happiness to him.

279
00:34:14.984 --> 00:34:17.275
I remember living poor in the cottage.

280
00:34:18.608 --> 00:34:19.983
Should I show you?

281
00:34:20.692 --> 00:34:21.816
Yes.

282
00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:27.983
Take this. It is my gift for you.

283
00:34:28.984 --> 00:34:30.524
No, I have no use for it.

284
00:34:30.608 --> 00:34:32.691
Are you so certain of everything?

285
00:34:45.359 --> 00:34:46.482
It was your mother's.

286
00:34:46.567 --> 00:34:50.108
Keep it close to your heart.
It is sure protection against harm.

287
00:34:55.025 --> 00:34:57.316
Are you so certain of everything?

288
00:35:13.067 --> 00:35:16.191
These are strange.
These markings, what are they?

289
00:35:16.276 --> 00:35:18.440
I've had them since I can remember.

290
00:35:29.317 --> 00:35:31.774
I used to play by this hearth as a child.

291
00:35:35.733 --> 00:35:37.857
It was my first drawing school,

292
00:35:37.942 --> 00:35:39.816
and my mother was my teacher.

293
00:35:42.483 --> 00:35:44.482
Oh, look. See?

294
00:35:44.567 --> 00:35:47.275
Carved into the fire back? The archer.

295
00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:49.774
I'd forgotten it.

296
00:35:51.608 --> 00:35:53.983
This was from long before
we lived here.

297
00:35:57.025 --> 00:35:59.774
- Are you all right?
- Yes, thank you.

298
00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.649
A cardinal. My favorite.

299
00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:09.024
I'd love to have a tame one, but
I wouldn't have the heart to cage him.

300
00:36:09.317 --> 00:36:13.024
Well, then I have something for you.

301
00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:19.108
Cardinal on one side. An empty cage.

302
00:36:19.984 --> 00:36:21.358
And now...

303
00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:27.066
You can do magic. Teach me.

304
00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:31.649
It is no magic. It is what we call optics.

305
00:36:31.692 --> 00:36:35.024
Separate pictures
which become one in the spinning.

306
00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:38.732
It is truth,
but truth is not always appearance.

307
00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:30.983
What are you running from,
Magistrate Philipse?

308
00:37:31.067 --> 00:37:32.149
Damn you, Crane.

309
00:37:32.234 --> 00:37:34.316
- You had a mind to help me?
- Yes,

310
00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:37.149
- and it's put me in mortal dread of...
- Of what?

311
00:37:37.192 --> 00:37:39.941
Of powers against which
there is no defense. Come.

312
00:37:39.984 --> 00:37:42.149
How did you know the Widow Winship
was expecting a child?

313
00:37:42.234 --> 00:37:43.440
She told me.

314
00:37:43.942 --> 00:37:46.941
- Then I deduce you are the father.
- I'm not the father.

315
00:37:46.984 --> 00:37:49.149
Did she tell you
the name of the child's father?

316
00:37:49.192 --> 00:37:51.233
Yes, she did.

317
00:37:51.317 --> 00:37:53.899
She came to me for advice
as town magistrate

318
00:37:53.984 --> 00:37:56.108
to protect the rights of her child.

319
00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:58.983
I was bound by my oath of office
to keep the secret, but...

320
00:37:59.067 --> 00:38:00.524
Do you believe the father killed her?

321
00:38:00.608 --> 00:38:03.108
The Horseman killed her.

322
00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:05.358
How often do I have to tell you?
There is no Horseman.

323
00:38:05.441 --> 00:38:08.482
Never was a Horseman,
and never will be a Horseman.

324
00:38:08.567 --> 00:38:10.316
What is that thing?

325
00:38:10.359 --> 00:38:12.899
My talisman.
It protects me from the Horseman.

326
00:38:12.984 --> 00:38:16.108
You, a magistrate,
and your head full of such nonsense.

327
00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:17.983
Now, tell me the name of...

328
00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:39.774
Oh, my God.

329
00:39:26.208 --> 00:39:29.249
Constable Crane? Constable Crane?

330
00:39:29.876 --> 00:39:31.666
Has he not come out at all?

331
00:39:37.542 --> 00:39:40.000
- It was a headless horseman.
- You must not excite yourself.

332
00:39:40.083 --> 00:39:41.207
But it was a headless horseman!

333
00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:43.166
Of course it was.
That's why you're here.

334
00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:46.875
No, you must believe me. It was
a horseman, a dead one. Headless.

335
00:39:46.917 --> 00:39:48.040
I know. I know.

336
00:39:48.083 --> 00:39:51.708
You don't know because
you were not there! It's all true.

337
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:54.708
Of course it is. I told you.
Everyone told you.

338
00:39:56.041 --> 00:39:58.249
I saw him.

339
00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:06.082
I suppose it's back to the city, then.

340
00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:32.749
All right, this time
I'll go to New York myself.

341
00:41:32.792 --> 00:41:35.499
I won't be fobbed off
with an amateur deductor.

342
00:41:47.584 --> 00:41:49.875
This time, it's a magistrate
that's dead and...

343
00:41:49.917 --> 00:41:51.166
Gentlemen.

344
00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:54.916
I need able men to go with me
into the Western Woods.

345
00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.291
You? We thought you'd shot your bolt.

346
00:41:58.375 --> 00:42:00.457
I have faced my fears,
and come out determined

347
00:42:00.542 --> 00:42:02.124
to locate the Horseman's grave.

348
00:42:02.208 --> 00:42:05.791
In short, to pit myself
against a murdering ghost.

349
00:42:08.083 --> 00:42:09.374
Who's with me?

350
00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:13.583
Me.

351
00:42:15.250 --> 00:42:17.958
The Van Garretts, Widow Winship,

352
00:42:18.041 --> 00:42:21.749
your father, Jonathan Masbath,
and now Philipse.

353
00:42:22.292 --> 00:42:24.124
Something must connect them.

354
00:42:24.625 --> 00:42:27.291
Did your father
have dealings with the Van Garretts?

355
00:42:27.375 --> 00:42:30.082
He worked for them.
We lived in the coach house.

356
00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:32.958
It's nothing.

357
00:42:34.876 --> 00:42:38.000
But there was something that happened
one night, a week before the murder.

358
00:42:38.083 --> 00:42:41.207
An argument upstairs
between father and son.

359
00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:44.207
And my father was later sent for
by Mr. Van Garrett.

360
00:42:45.959 --> 00:42:48.749
An argument between father and son.

361
00:42:49.584 --> 00:42:53.082
After which the elder Van Garrett sent
for his servant Masbath.

362
00:42:53.709 --> 00:42:54.875
Listen.

363
00:42:56.625 --> 00:42:58.249
- I hear nothing.
- Nor I.

364
00:42:59.333 --> 00:43:03.749
No birds. No crickets.
It's all gone so quiet.

365
00:43:12.584 --> 00:43:13.833
Quicken pace.

366
00:44:03.417 --> 00:44:04.916
Pardon our intrusion,

367
00:44:04.959 --> 00:44:09.082
- but perhaps you could help us?
- You're from the Hollow.

368
00:44:09.542 --> 00:44:12.332
Yes. In a way, yes.

369
00:44:15.584 --> 00:44:19.916
I should like to say that I make
no assumptions about your occupation.

370
00:44:19.959 --> 00:44:23.666
Nor your ways, which, which, which are

371
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:25.749
nothing to me, whatever you are.

372
00:44:26.667 --> 00:44:28.082
Each to his own.

373
00:44:31.792 --> 00:44:32.916
Oh.

374
00:44:38.584 --> 00:44:42.875
Do you know of the Horseman, ma'am?
The Hessian?

375
00:44:46.083 --> 00:44:47.666
That'll be him, ma'am.

376
00:44:48.917 --> 00:44:50.833
You, come with me.

377
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:54.416
Go out, child. Keep away.

378
00:44:54.458 --> 00:44:56.749
Whatever you hear, keep away.

379
00:45:03.458 --> 00:45:06.166
What might he hear
that he must keep away from?

380
00:45:12.417 --> 00:45:15.875
He rides. To the Hollow and back.

381
00:45:15.917 --> 00:45:20.499
- I hear him. I smell the blood on him.
- Do you?

382
00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:26.958
Well, I'm here to find him
and make him stop.

383
00:45:34.083 --> 00:45:35.916
You seek knowledge
of the netherworld?

384
00:45:35.959 --> 00:45:37.207
I can show you.

385
00:45:46.292 --> 00:45:49.916
- What are you doing?
- Do not move or speak.

386
00:45:49.959 --> 00:45:52.499
When the other comes, I will hold him.

387
00:45:52.584 --> 00:45:55.749
- The other?
- Silence. He comes now.

388
00:46:05.876 --> 00:46:06.958
Madam?

389
00:46:09.834 --> 00:46:11.416
Madam, do you hear me?

390
00:46:23.959 --> 00:46:27.916
You seek the warrior bathed in blood,
the Headless Horseman.

391
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.749
Follow the Indian trail
to where the sun dies.

392
00:46:31.834 --> 00:46:33.833
Follow it to the Tree of the Dead.

393
00:46:33.917 --> 00:46:37.583
Climb down
to the Horseman's resting place.

394
00:46:44.917 --> 00:46:46.082
We're leaving.

395
00:46:46.125 --> 00:46:48.249
- What happened?
- We're leaving now.

396
00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:52.833
We take the Indian trail
to the Tree of the Dead.

397
00:46:52.917 --> 00:46:56.082
- How will we recognize it?
- Without difficulty, I rather fear.

398
00:46:56.167 --> 00:46:58.541
We climb down
to the Horseman's resting place.

399
00:46:58.584 --> 00:47:00.583
- His camp?
- His grave.

400
00:47:11.834 --> 00:47:13.416
Stay here.

401
00:47:50.917 --> 00:47:53.166
Halt and turn, I have a pistol aimed.

402
00:47:55.333 --> 00:47:56.708
Katrina?

403
00:47:57.083 --> 00:47:59.291
I might have killed you.
Why have you come?

404
00:47:59.375 --> 00:48:01.624
Because no one else would go with you.

405
00:48:02.709 --> 00:48:04.833
Well, then I am now twice the man.

406
00:48:06.333 --> 00:48:07.958
It is your white magic.

407
00:48:12.041 --> 00:48:13.541
Pardon my intrusion.

408
00:48:13.584 --> 00:48:16.332
I think you'd better come
and look at this.

409
00:48:58.834 --> 00:49:01.082
The Tree of the Dead.

410
00:49:17.792 --> 00:49:19.499
Blood.

411
00:49:22.375 --> 00:49:25.374
Stay where you are.

412
00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:09.332
- What is it?
- Just stay where you are. Don't move.

413
00:50:24.625 --> 00:50:29.082
This tree is a gateway.
A gateway between two worlds.

414
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:45.749
This ground has been disturbed.
The soil is loose.

415
00:50:45.834 --> 00:50:47.749
Bring the shovel.

416
00:51:05.333 --> 00:51:09.833
The skull is gone. Taken.

417
00:51:10.375 --> 00:51:13.082
That is why
the Horseman returns from the grave.

418
00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:17.416
To take heads
till his own is restored to him.

419
00:51:36.550 --> 00:51:38.549
Ichabod?

420
00:52:27.050 --> 00:52:30.216
Split up. Glenn. Theodore.

421
00:52:49.467 --> 00:52:52.716
Don't pick your teeth,
you'll teach Thomas bad habits.

422
00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:57.133
- I am a bad habit. There's nothing for it.
- Oh, isn't there?

423
00:53:15.842 --> 00:53:19.216
- Come on, let's get ready for bed.
- Yes.

424
00:53:41.667 --> 00:53:44.000
Beth, run!

425
00:54:04.542 --> 00:54:06.541
Stay quiet.

426
00:56:51.208 --> 00:56:54.875
- Wait! He's not after you.
- I'll get him.

427
00:57:14.876 --> 00:57:16.749
We cannot win this.

428
00:58:15.125 --> 00:58:17.749
Remarkable.
A wound like this should've killed him.

429
00:58:17.834 --> 00:58:21.082
But it needs no stitch,
and there's hardly a loss of blood.

430
00:58:22.750 --> 00:58:26.207
You must be still. The fever is on you.

431
00:58:27.917 --> 00:58:29.291
Katrina.

432
00:58:29.709 --> 00:58:33.207
Nostradamus mediamus, milk of mercy,

433
00:58:33.584 --> 00:58:36.583
in media nos laudamas.

434
00:58:53.292 --> 00:58:57.124
Katrina, I tried to stop Brom, but...

435
00:58:58.125 --> 00:59:00.749
Drink this down. It'll make you sleep.

436
00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:06.374
The Horseman was not set to kill Brom
or me. Had Brom not attacked him...

437
00:59:06.417 --> 00:59:08.082
Later. Rest now.

438
00:59:08.167 --> 00:59:11.958
I've discovered something.
The Horseman does not kill at random.

439
00:59:12.292 --> 00:59:15.166
His victims are chosen
by someone who controls him.

440
00:59:15.625 --> 00:59:18.082
By that very person who took his skull.

441
00:59:18.917 --> 00:59:20.666
Someone who knew where to dig.

442
00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:24.040
Someone of flesh and blood,
as I've always said.

443
00:59:24.333 --> 00:59:27.666
- These are ravings.
- Drink.

444
01:00:01.333 --> 01:00:18.624
Ichabod.

445
01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:41.291
- You were dreaming.
- Yes.

446
01:00:42.750 --> 01:00:44.875
Things I had forgotten.

447
01:00:48.208 --> 01:00:52.166
- And would not like to remember.
- Tell me what you dreamt.

448
01:00:52.917 --> 01:00:56.207
My mother was an innocent.
A child of nature.

449
01:00:58.375 --> 01:01:00.416
Condemned.

450
01:01:01.417 --> 01:01:03.916
Murdered. By my father.

451
01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:07.583
- Murdered by...
- Murdered to save her soul

452
01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:12.916
by a Bible-black tyrant
behind a mask of righteousness.

453
01:01:14.375 --> 01:01:17.624
I was seven when I lost my faith.

454
01:01:19.959 --> 01:01:21.708
What do you believe in?

455
01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:25.749
Sense and reason.
Cause and consequence.

456
01:01:28.625 --> 01:01:30.916
I should not have come to this place,

457
01:01:31.208 --> 01:01:34.749
where my rational mind has been
so controverted by the spirit world.

458
01:01:34.792 --> 01:01:36.416
Will you take nothing
from Sleepy Hollow

459
01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:38.457
that was worth the coming here?

460
01:01:40.792 --> 01:01:43.749
No. No, not nothing.

461
01:01:46.375 --> 01:01:48.916
A kiss from a lovely young woman,

462
01:01:49.917 --> 01:01:52.207
before she saw my face
or knew my name.

463
01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:55.708
Yes, without sense or reason.

464
01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:03.000
Forgive me, I speak of kisses

465
01:02:04.083 --> 01:02:06.416
and you've lost your brave man, Brom.

466
01:02:07.709 --> 01:02:12.249
I have shed my tears for Brom,
and yet my heart is not broken.

467
01:02:14.917 --> 01:02:18.207
- Do you think me wicked?
- No.

468
01:02:19.959 --> 01:02:23.000
But perhaps there is a bit
of a witch in you, Katrina.

469
01:02:23.876 --> 01:02:27.958
- Why do you say that?
- Because you have bewitched me.

470
01:02:41.417 --> 01:02:42.416
Oh.

471
01:02:43.083 --> 01:02:46.749
- You slept like the dead.
- You're too kind to me.

472
01:02:47.292 --> 01:02:49.624
I do not look to be served
by the lady of the house.

473
01:02:49.709 --> 01:02:54.207
Nor would you be,
but that the servant girl has vanished.

474
01:02:54.250 --> 01:02:58.207
- Sarah?
- Run away like so many others.

475
01:02:58.792 --> 01:03:00.749
They're all leaving in fear.

476
01:03:02.417 --> 01:03:04.207
Where is Katrina?

477
01:03:04.917 --> 01:03:09.000
She watched over you till dawn.
Now it is her turn to sleep.

478
01:03:14.959 --> 01:03:17.916
Well, I'm fit for another day, I think.

479
01:03:19.959 --> 01:03:22.791
Fit enough to face a mortal adversary.

480
01:03:24.792 --> 01:03:28.166
Doctor Lancaster, Reverend Steenwyck,

481
01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:36.207
Notary Hardenbrook,
and Magistrate Philipse.

482
01:03:38.083 --> 01:03:40.708
Who tried to cut and run,
and lost his head.

483
01:03:41.625 --> 01:03:44.583
All frightened men,
arguing together on the very night

484
01:03:44.667 --> 01:03:47.000
Magistrate Philipse was killed.

485
01:03:49.041 --> 01:03:51.249
There is conspiracy here.

486
01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:58.875
The doctor, the reverend, the notary

487
01:03:59.417 --> 01:04:01.207
and the magistrate.

488
01:04:03.083 --> 01:04:05.708
What is this secret that unites them?

489
01:04:09.041 --> 01:04:12.291
Magistrate Philipse knew
there were five bodies to four graves.

490
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:16.124
He knew the Widow was pregnant.

491
01:04:17.083 --> 01:04:19.624
He would not tell me
the name of the father.

492
01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:22.791
What does this point to?

493
01:04:30.167 --> 01:04:33.000
We must proceed
by a process of elimination.

494
01:04:33.458 --> 01:04:36.457
I shall make a list of
every man and woman in Sleepy Hollow,

495
01:04:36.542 --> 01:04:40.000
starting with its chief citizen,
Baltus Van Tassel.

496
01:04:42.959 --> 01:04:45.000
I feel we're getting very close.

497
01:04:45.083 --> 01:04:48.708
Yes, I suppose
Baltus is the chief citizen,

498
01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:50.833
now that old Van Garrett is dead.

499
01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:55.833
Yes, the Van Garretts.
I'd almost forgotten them.

500
01:05:07.876 --> 01:05:09.249
Come with me.

501
01:05:09.375 --> 01:05:11.666
- Where?
- To Notary Hardenbrook's.

502
01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:16.583
- Have you thought of something?
- Yes. I have.

503
01:05:31.876 --> 01:05:33.416
Hopeless.

504
01:05:42.292 --> 01:05:46.583
My father's satchel. Why is it here?

505
01:05:51.083 --> 01:05:52.916
- Leave me alone.
- Notary Hardenbrook.

506
01:05:52.959 --> 01:05:54.916
Leave me alone!

507
01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.332
Just as soon as you show me
the last will and testament

508
01:05:57.417 --> 01:05:59.082
of old man Van Garrett.

509
01:05:59.250 --> 01:06:02.082
The will leaves everything to his son.

510
01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:06.416
Who died with him.
So the estate passes to the next of kin.

511
01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:10.624
- Naturally. All legal and above board.
- Sir.

512
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.791
I'm a dead man. No.

513
01:06:17.292 --> 01:06:20.249
Van Garrett's seal. Broken.

514
01:06:22.917 --> 01:06:25.833
Seems Van Garrett
made a new will just before he died.

515
01:06:25.917 --> 01:06:30.249
Naming Widow Winship?

516
01:06:30.375 --> 01:06:33.749
And here, look. A marriage certificate.

517
01:06:36.375 --> 01:06:38.749
Old Van Garrett
secretly married the Widow.

518
01:06:38.792 --> 01:06:41.791
Left everything to her
and her unborn child.

519
01:06:42.792 --> 01:06:45.958
So the new will
stood between the Van Garrett fortune

520
01:06:46.041 --> 01:06:49.082
and the person who would have
otherwise inherited everything.

521
01:06:49.125 --> 01:06:53.916
It's true. But we four were drawn in
against our will.

522
01:06:54.333 --> 01:06:56.666
- Your will?
- He means...

523
01:06:57.083 --> 01:07:00.541
Of course. The four town elders.

524
01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:03.916
Now I see what parts you had to play.

525
01:07:05.167 --> 01:07:08.583
Reverend Steenwyck knew the secret
because he performed the marriage.

526
01:07:08.625 --> 01:07:11.416
Dr. Lancaster attended
the pregnant woman.

527
01:07:11.834 --> 01:07:14.666
Magistrate Philipse
gave protection of the law.

528
01:07:14.917 --> 01:07:17.583
And Notary Hardenbrook
concealed the documents,

529
01:07:17.959 --> 01:07:21.332
which had been entrusted
by Van Garrett to his faithful servant.

530
01:07:21.417 --> 01:07:24.249
The four conspirators
drawn into the plot.

531
01:07:24.667 --> 01:07:27.749
We did not know
it was a murdering plot.

532
01:07:27.792 --> 01:07:29.833
But I have not finished, sir.

533
01:07:30.083 --> 01:07:33.416
First, the Van Garretts, father and son,
slain by a horseman

534
01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:35.457
raised from the grave to chop heads.

535
01:07:35.542 --> 01:07:39.416
Now, up pops a widow with a claim
on a fortune. Off with her head!

536
01:07:40.083 --> 01:07:42.249
But murder begets murder.

537
01:07:42.876 --> 01:07:46.082
It was the servant, Jonathan Masbath.

538
01:07:46.750 --> 01:07:49.749
The night father and son
quarreled over the new will,

539
01:07:49.917 --> 01:07:53.000
Jonathan Masbath was summoned
upstairs to bear witness.

540
01:07:53.834 --> 01:07:55.583
Here is his signature.

541
01:07:55.625 --> 01:07:58.416
I'm afraid it was his death warrant,
young Masbath.

542
01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:00.833
The Horseman came for him.

543
01:08:02.083 --> 01:08:05.958
Came for him at the bidding of
someone who had power over him.

544
01:08:06.333 --> 01:08:09.541
Someone who dug in the earth in
the Western Woods and stole the skull.

545
01:08:09.584 --> 01:08:12.166
The missing head, which must
be restored to the Horseman

546
01:08:12.250 --> 01:08:14.166
before he will return to Hell.

547
01:08:14.375 --> 01:08:17.207
Someone who stood to gain
or lose a fortune.

548
01:08:17.709 --> 01:08:23.266
None other than Van Garrett's
next of kin, Baltus Van Tassel!

549
01:08:29.276 --> 01:08:34.149
- Katrina? Why are you in my room?
- Because it is yours.

550
01:08:37.858 --> 01:08:41.816
- Was it wicked of me?
- No. No, not at all.

551
01:08:43.692 --> 01:08:45.857
I missed you. Where did you go?

552
01:08:45.942 --> 01:08:48.941
To the notary.
I had questions to ask Hardenbrook.

553
01:08:49.317 --> 01:08:51.691
And did you learn anything of interest?

554
01:08:53.942 --> 01:08:55.316
Perhaps.

555
01:08:56.109 --> 01:08:58.149
- My father...
- Your father?

556
01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:02.316
Yes. My father thinks
you should return to New York.

557
01:09:02.441 --> 01:09:05.649
Really? Why is that?

558
01:09:06.276 --> 01:09:07.983
I don't know.

559
01:09:08.317 --> 01:09:11.732
Perhaps he looked in your ledger
and did not like what he saw.

560
01:09:17.276 --> 01:09:21.316
- What have you there?
- Evidence. I'm sorry, I must ask you...

561
01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:23.649
Then I'll leave you to your thoughts.

562
01:09:38.150 --> 01:09:42.607
- It's just a spider.
- Kill it! Kill it! No, no, stomp it!

563
01:09:44.900 --> 01:09:47.482
- There's something under here.
- What is it?

564
01:09:49.441 --> 01:09:52.440
- Help me move the bed.
- No, no, I mustn't. You do it.

565
01:09:59.234 --> 01:10:04.066
The evil eye. It is someone
casting spells against you.

566
01:10:05.858 --> 01:10:07.649
The evil eye?

567
01:10:58.733 --> 01:11:00.275
Wait here.

568
01:12:15.650 --> 01:12:19.983
Katrina, you took the evidence

569
01:12:20.067 --> 01:12:21.108
and burned it.

570
01:12:21.150 --> 01:12:23.649
So you would not have it
to accuse my father.

571
01:12:23.733 --> 01:12:25.482
I accuse no one.

572
01:12:25.567 --> 01:12:27.440
But if there is guilt, I cannot alter it,

573
01:12:27.483 --> 01:12:29.024
no matter how much it grieves me.

574
01:12:29.109 --> 01:12:31.649
And no spells of yours
can alter it, either.

575
01:12:31.692 --> 01:12:33.191
Your father has the motive.

576
01:12:33.276 --> 01:12:35.482
It is he who stands to profit
from these murders.

577
01:12:35.525 --> 01:12:39.149
If you knew him, you would not have
such harsh thoughts about him.

578
01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:41.440
No, nor if you felt anything for me.

579
01:12:41.483 --> 01:12:43.275
I am pinioned by a chain of reasoning.

580
01:12:43.317 --> 01:12:45.566
Why else did his four friends
conspire to conceal...

581
01:12:45.650 --> 01:12:47.482
You are the constable, not I.

582
01:12:47.525 --> 01:12:50.149
So find another chain of reasoning
and let me be.

583
01:12:50.192 --> 01:12:55.108
I cannot, not the one or the other.
And I am heartsick with it.

584
01:12:55.441 --> 01:13:00.149
I think you have no heart.
And I had a mind once to give you mine.

585
01:13:01.109 --> 01:13:04.774
Yes, I think you loved me that day
when you followed me

586
01:13:04.817 --> 01:13:07.816
into the Western Woods
to have braved such peril.

587
01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:09.191
What peril was there for me,

588
01:13:09.276 --> 01:13:12.649
if it was my own father who controlled
the Headless Horseman?

589
01:13:17.567 --> 01:13:19.024
Goodbye, Ichabod Crane.

590
01:13:19.109 --> 01:13:21.774
I curse the day
you came to Sleepy Hollow.

591
01:13:26.692 --> 01:13:31.275
- She will not see you.
- Did she say anything?

592
01:13:33.692 --> 01:13:36.024
Only that she will not come down.

593
01:13:37.150 --> 01:13:39.233
I see. Thank you.

594
01:13:39.483 --> 01:13:41.316
Constable?

595
01:13:42.733 --> 01:13:46.482
You have not asked me how
I have hurt my hand since yesterday,

596
01:13:47.441 --> 01:13:49.316
which would have been polite.

597
01:13:50.984 --> 01:13:53.316
In fact, you have been as careful

598
01:13:53.692 --> 01:13:57.566
not to look at it as not to mention it.

599
01:13:59.109 --> 01:14:01.691
Yes, I'm sorry. How did you...

600
01:14:01.775 --> 01:14:05.149
- I know you saw me.
- What?

601
01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:08.607
I know you followed last night.

602
01:14:09.025 --> 01:14:12.191
And you must promise
not to tell my husband what you saw.

603
01:14:12.567 --> 01:14:13.983
Promise me!

604
01:14:14.817 --> 01:14:16.816
The town is in ferment.

605
01:14:17.025 --> 01:14:20.108
Horror piled on tragedy.
Hardenbrook is dead.

606
01:14:20.150 --> 01:14:23.941
- Oh, no! That harmless old man?
- Hanged himself in the night.

607
01:14:23.984 --> 01:14:25.149
Hanged himself?

608
01:14:25.234 --> 01:14:27.941
Reverend Steenwyck's
called a meeting in the church tonight.

609
01:14:27.984 --> 01:14:31.566
Every man, woman, and child
is going to speak out against you.

610
01:14:31.650 --> 01:14:34.482
If you are wise, you will leave this place.

611
01:14:36.067 --> 01:14:39.983
- What is that?
- I was careless with the kitchen knife.

612
01:14:40.025 --> 01:14:41.774
The wound looks angry.

613
01:14:41.817 --> 01:14:45.316
I will bind it later
with wild arrowroot flowers.

614
01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:47.191
I know where some grow.

615
01:14:57.400 --> 01:15:00.691
Come on, hurry up.
The meeting bell started tolling.

616
01:15:25.067 --> 01:15:26.482
The Horseman!

617
01:15:28.067 --> 01:15:29.400
- Katrina!
- Father?

618
01:15:29.483 --> 01:15:31.816
The Horseman! Save me!

619
01:15:33.608 --> 01:15:36.983
He killed her.
The Horseman killed your stepmother.

620
01:15:45.984 --> 01:15:47.649
Oh, God!

621
01:15:59.192 --> 01:16:01.149
Fire!

622
01:16:17.650 --> 01:16:21.607
You'll kill us all!
You're the one the Horseman wants.

623
01:16:42.150 --> 01:16:43.941
He cannot enter.

624
01:16:43.984 --> 01:16:45.607
Over here!

625
01:16:53.817 --> 01:16:54.816
The Horseman cannot enter.

626
01:16:54.900 --> 01:16:56.275
Why should we die for you?

627
01:16:56.317 --> 01:16:58.649
The Horseman cannot enter.
He cannot cross the gate.

628
01:16:58.733 --> 01:17:00.983
We have to save ourselves.

629
01:17:02.192 --> 01:17:05.358
The next person that lays a hand on me
will get a bullet!

630
01:17:07.692 --> 01:17:09.316
He's coming back!

631
01:17:16.483 --> 01:17:19.566
Enough have died already.
It's time to confess our sins.

632
01:17:19.650 --> 01:17:23.024
- What is it that you know?
- Your four friends played you false.

633
01:17:23.109 --> 01:17:25.566
We were devilishly possessed
by one who...

634
01:17:34.192 --> 01:17:38.149
Get out of my way!
Stand back! Stay back!

635
01:17:48.441 --> 01:17:51.400
Back! Stand back!

636
01:17:56.900 --> 01:18:00.691
There is a conspiracy here,
and I will shake it out.

637
01:19:16.483 --> 01:19:18.691
It was an evil spirit possessed you.

638
01:19:19.733 --> 01:19:22.857
I pray God it is satisfied now,
and that you find peace.

639
01:19:22.942 --> 01:19:24.816
The evil eye's done its work.

640
01:19:25.234 --> 01:19:29.941
My life is over, spared for
a lifetime of horrors in my sleep,

641
01:19:30.984 --> 01:19:32.983
waking each day to grief.

642
01:19:39.483 --> 01:19:40.983
Goodbye, Katrina.

643
01:20:19.150 --> 01:20:23.316
- You think it was Katrina, don't you?
- That can never be uttered.

644
01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:26.816
A strange sort of witch,
with a kind and loving heart.

645
01:20:26.900 --> 01:20:29.400
- How can you think so?
- I have good reason.

646
01:20:29.483 --> 01:20:32.774
- Then you are bewitched by reason.
- I am beaten down by it!

647
01:20:38.317 --> 01:20:39.816
It is a hard lesson for a hard world,

648
01:20:39.858 --> 01:20:42.024
and you had better learn it,
young Masbath.

649
01:20:42.109 --> 01:20:43.983
Villainy wears many masks.

650
01:20:44.150 --> 01:20:47.108
None so dangerous
as the mask of virtue.

651
01:20:55.192 --> 01:20:56.649
Farewell.

652
01:22:26.567 --> 01:22:28.108
- Van Ripper, turn the coach.
- What?

653
01:22:28.150 --> 01:22:29.691
Turn around now!

654
01:22:43.317 --> 01:22:44.816
Pardon my intrusion.

655
01:22:55.525 --> 01:22:59.316
No blood flow, no clotting, no healing.

656
01:23:02.234 --> 01:23:05.983
When this cut was made,
this woman was already dead.

657
01:23:16.567 --> 01:23:18.233
Dear stepdaughter,

658
01:23:20.525 --> 01:23:22.691
you look as if you'd seen a ghost.

659
01:23:54.276 --> 01:23:57.983
Rise up once more, my dark avenger.

660
01:23:58.234 --> 01:24:03.149
One more night of beheading.
Rise up with your sword.

661
01:24:03.567 --> 01:24:07.149
A head for a head.

662
01:24:07.317 --> 01:24:10.233
My unholy horseman, rise!

663
01:24:11.067 --> 01:24:15.233
Come now for Katrina!

664
01:24:28.567 --> 01:24:30.482
Awake at last.

665
01:24:31.483 --> 01:24:34.400
Did you think it was all a nasty dream?

666
01:24:34.483 --> 01:24:36.566
Father saw the Horseman kill you.

667
01:24:36.984 --> 01:24:40.816
He saw the Horseman come
towards me with his sword unsheathed,

668
01:24:41.234 --> 01:24:44.649
but it is I who govern the Horseman,
my dear.

669
01:24:44.984 --> 01:24:47.482
And Baltus did not stay to watch.

670
01:24:51.984 --> 01:24:55.482
- But there was a body.
- The servant girl, Sarah.

671
01:24:55.525 --> 01:24:57.899
And I always thought she was useless.

672
01:25:01.359 --> 01:25:04.191
But it seems
she had a purpose after all.

673
01:25:09.441 --> 01:25:11.191
Who are you?

674
01:25:11.817 --> 01:25:16.691
- My family name was Archer.
- The archer.

675
01:25:23.525 --> 01:25:27.816
I lived with my father and mother
and sister in a cottage not far from here.

676
01:25:27.858 --> 01:25:29.732
Until one day my father died,

677
01:25:29.817 --> 01:25:32.983
and the landlord, who had received
many years of loyal service

678
01:25:33.067 --> 01:25:35.108
from my parents, evicted us.

679
01:25:35.650 --> 01:25:38.316
No one in this God-fearing town
would take us in

680
01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:41.233
because my mother
was suspected of witchcraft.

681
01:25:41.984 --> 01:25:43.857
But she schooled her daughters well,

682
01:25:43.942 --> 01:25:47.108
while we lived as outcasts
in the Western Woods.

683
01:25:47.858 --> 01:25:50.440
She died within a year.

684
01:25:55.359 --> 01:26:00.191
My sister and I remained in our refuge,
seeing not a soul.

685
01:26:00.858 --> 01:26:04.857
Until one day, whilst gathering firewood,

686
01:26:04.942 --> 01:26:07.524
we crossed the path of the Hessian.

687
01:26:13.276 --> 01:26:15.108
I saw his death.

688
01:26:15.650 --> 01:26:19.566
At that moment,
I offered my soul to Satan,

689
01:26:19.650 --> 01:26:24.149
if he would raise the Hessian
from the grave to avenge me.

690
01:26:28.650 --> 01:26:31.482
- Avenge you?
- Against Van Garrett.

691
01:26:31.692 --> 01:26:34.899
The landlord who showed us no mercy
and left us to starve,

692
01:26:34.984 --> 01:26:38.816
whilst Baltus Van Tassel
and his simpering wife and girl child

693
01:26:38.858 --> 01:26:40.316
stole our home.

694
01:26:40.483 --> 01:26:43.607
I swore I would make myself
mistress of all he had.

695
01:26:43.650 --> 01:26:45.941
The easiest part was the first.

696
01:26:46.025 --> 01:26:48.691
To enter your house
as your mother's sick nurse,

697
01:26:48.775 --> 01:26:52.983
and put her body into the grave
and my own into the marriage bed.

698
01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:56.649
Not quite so easy
was to secure my legacy.

699
01:26:57.276 --> 01:26:59.816
The Widow had to go, of course.

700
01:27:00.525 --> 01:27:02.358
And the servant, Masbath.

701
01:27:02.650 --> 01:27:05.983
And then, just the other day,
that silly midwife Killian

702
01:27:06.067 --> 01:27:09.440
told me the Widow had told her
a big secret.

703
01:27:09.483 --> 01:27:12.649
And she told me this
right in front of her husband.

704
01:27:12.900 --> 01:27:14.149
What a goose!

705
01:27:15.608 --> 01:27:17.899
So, another little job for the Horseman.

706
01:27:21.109 --> 01:27:26.024
But lust delivered
the Reverend Steenwyck into my power.

707
01:27:27.775 --> 01:27:30.358
Fear did the same
for the notary, Hardenbrook,

708
01:27:30.441 --> 01:27:32.149
and the drunkard Philipse.

709
01:27:32.608 --> 01:27:35.275
And the doctor's silence I exchanged

710
01:27:35.317 --> 01:27:40.316
for my complicity in his fornications
with the servant girl, Sarah.

711
01:27:40.984 --> 01:27:44.566
- Yes, you have everything now.
- No.

712
01:27:44.984 --> 01:27:48.607
You have, my dear, by your father's will.

713
01:27:49.234 --> 01:27:52.275
I get everything
in the event of your death.

714
01:27:54.067 --> 01:27:58.233
My sister, by the way,
sadly passed away.

715
01:28:01.025 --> 01:28:02.649
Quite recently.

716
01:28:04.984 --> 01:28:07.024
You killed your own sister?

717
01:28:07.150 --> 01:28:11.649
She brought it on herself
by helping you and your master.

718
01:28:13.984 --> 01:28:16.816
You're just in time
to have your head cut off.

719
01:28:17.150 --> 01:28:21.482
The Horseman comes!
And tonight, he comes for you!

720
01:28:27.567 --> 01:28:28.941
Katrina!

721
01:28:35.192 --> 01:28:36.607
Thank God.

722
01:28:45.525 --> 01:28:47.482
Watch your head.

723
01:29:03.150 --> 01:29:04.983
To the roof! I have an idea.

724
01:30:05.192 --> 01:30:06.816
Jump for the sails.

725
01:30:22.150 --> 01:30:23.400
Jump!

726
01:30:29.109 --> 01:30:30.191
Hurry!

727
01:30:50.483 --> 01:30:52.899
- Is he dead?
- That's the problem.

728
01:30:52.984 --> 01:30:54.691
He was dead to begin with.

729
01:31:18.025 --> 01:31:19.816
- Where are we going?
- Anywhere but here.

730
01:31:33.608 --> 01:31:35.149
Here, take the reins.

731
01:31:55.983 --> 01:31:57.608
Ichabod!

732
01:32:53.317 --> 01:32:54.649
My bag!

733
01:33:12.233 --> 01:33:13.399
Jump!

734
01:34:16.567 --> 01:34:18.691
- Still alive?
- Run, Katrina.

735
01:34:19.983 --> 01:34:23.816
Yes, do run, and jump, and skip.

736
01:34:26.317 --> 01:34:27.483
No!

737
01:34:36.192 --> 01:34:39.149
Here! Take her!

738
01:34:39.650 --> 01:34:41.982
She's yours!

739
01:34:44.692 --> 01:34:47.399
Sir, you're not dead.

740
01:35:28.900 --> 01:35:30.232
Horseman!

741
01:39:03.192 --> 01:39:05.482
Just in time for a new century.

742
01:39:18.441 --> 01:39:20.482
You'll soon get your bearings,
young Masbath.

743
01:39:20.525 --> 01:39:22.899
The Bronx is up, the Battery's down,

744
01:39:22.984 --> 01:39:25.981
and home is this way.
