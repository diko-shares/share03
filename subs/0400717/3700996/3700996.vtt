1
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.491
Now, that's a roar, Boog.

2
00:01:24.936 --> 00:01:26.699
Now get in. We're gonna be late.

3
00:01:28.173 --> 00:01:32.906
No denying. The girl's got growl.
But can she get down like this?

4
00:01:33.078 --> 00:01:35.808
Can you get down like this?
Bring it here. Bring it.

5
00:01:35.981 --> 00:01:38.745
Then bring it right back, huh?
Look at that. Look at that.

6
00:01:53.598 --> 00:01:55.225
Here it comes.

7
00:02:42.213 --> 00:02:44.113
Hey, Gordy.

8
00:02:45.116 --> 00:02:46.811
Morning, Beth.

9
00:02:56.661 --> 00:03:00.097
Welcome to Timberline's
Wilderness Extravaganza.

10
00:03:00.265 --> 00:03:02.790
I'm Ranger Beth.

11
00:03:02.967 --> 00:03:05.697
Please, put your hands together
for Boog.

12
00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.033
Behold, the mighty grizzly.

13
00:03:22.354 --> 00:03:25.517
<i>You can say I'm in love
You could say I'm insane</i>

14
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.717
<i>But no one understands me
Like my darling Lorraine</i>

15
00:03:37.802 --> 00:03:42.330
Looks like you're going
from one grill to another.

16
00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:47.071
We rocked that house,
didn't we, Boog?

17
00:03:47.245 --> 00:03:51.079
They were eating out of our hands.
Well, my hands, your paws.

18
00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:54.184
Eating out of your paw.

19
00:03:54.753 --> 00:03:58.655
That's good.
That's going in the show.

20
00:03:59.724 --> 00:04:04.024
Shaw.
That guy really chaps my khakis.

21
00:04:04.195 --> 00:04:06.288
You wait here, Boog.

22
00:04:08.366 --> 00:04:10.857
- Cuff him, Gordy.
- Oh, the Girl Scouts are here.

23
00:04:11.035 --> 00:04:12.525
He's at it again.

24
00:04:13.271 --> 00:04:16.604
Shaw, hunting season doesn't start
for three days.

25
00:04:16.775 --> 00:04:19.073
What are you doing
with that buck on your hood?

26
00:04:19.244 --> 00:04:23.704
What? It ain't my fault.
He ran right in front of my truck.

27
00:04:23.882 --> 00:04:25.850
Where, on the interstate?

28
00:04:30.422 --> 00:04:32.014
Sort of.

29
00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:37.493
Where is that girl?

30
00:04:47.739 --> 00:04:49.969
That's nasty.

31
00:04:57.048 --> 00:05:01.007
What? What the...?
What's going on? Where am I?

32
00:05:01.186 --> 00:05:04.883
I saw a bright light and...
I saw two bright lights and...

33
00:05:05.056 --> 00:05:07.889
- Am I dead?
- Not yet.

34
00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:09.993
But seeing how
that is Shaw's truck...

35
00:05:10.161 --> 00:05:12.925
- What's a Shaw?
- Only the nastiest hunter in town.

36
00:05:13.097 --> 00:05:15.827
A hunter? Did he get you too?

37
00:05:16.534 --> 00:05:18.297
You don't see me tied up,
do you, baby?

38
00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.234
- This is my ride.
- Your ride?

39
00:05:21.406 --> 00:05:22.839
Yeah, this is my town, okay?

40
00:05:23.007 --> 00:05:26.272
These are my people.
This is where I reside.

41
00:05:28.446 --> 00:05:30.812
Nobody's hunting this bear.

42
00:05:31.316 --> 00:05:36.413
Really? Well, then untie me.
Please? Look, no one's looking.

43
00:05:36.588 --> 00:05:38.886
- Ain't gonna be able to do it.
- What am I gonna do?

44
00:05:39.057 --> 00:05:41.457
I don't wanna be mounted on a wall.

45
00:05:41.626 --> 00:05:43.856
- Calm down. Ain't gonna happen.
- It's not?

46
00:05:44.028 --> 00:05:48.590
- Not with that rack.
- I don't have a problem with...

47
00:05:48.766 --> 00:05:51.166
My... It's...

48
00:05:51.769 --> 00:05:55.603
I'm a unihorn. Don't look at me.
Don't look at me.

49
00:05:55.773 --> 00:05:59.106
I'm hideous. I'm a monster.

50
00:06:00.144 --> 00:06:00.278
- Tree-hugger.
- Knuckle dragger.

51
00:06:00.278 --> 00:06:02.075
- Tree-hugger.
- Knuckle dragger.

52
00:06:02.247 --> 00:06:03.509
Veggieburger.

53
00:06:03.715 --> 00:06:05.774
All right, all right.
That's enough, you two.

54
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.248
Listen, Girl Scout,
they're dumb animals.

55
00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:14.051
I'm just respecting the natural order:
Man on top, animals on the bottom.

56
00:06:14.225 --> 00:06:17.820
But your bear...
Now, now, your bear is special.

57
00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:20.964
He belongs somewhere
in the middle.

58
00:06:21.132 --> 00:06:25.159
Between two slices of rye,
smothered in gravy.

59
00:06:25.603 --> 00:06:29.972
You're a sick, sick,
twisted puppy, Shaw.

60
00:06:30.842 --> 00:06:35.211
Put me down for a box of Thin Mints,
will you, sweetie?

61
00:06:37.015 --> 00:06:40.644
Six-toed gun monkey.
Boog, come on, let's get out of here.

62
00:06:41.085 --> 00:06:45.647
Come on, I'm begging you.
Please, please. Just untie me.

63
00:06:45.823 --> 00:06:48.758
Come on. Please, please, please?

64
00:06:52.797 --> 00:06:55.994
Hey, go on now. Scamper on
back to the woods, little buddy.

65
00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.700
Little one-horned freak.

66
00:07:01.873 --> 00:07:04.899
Buddy? He called me "buddy."

67
00:07:08.546 --> 00:07:09.979
My buck.

68
00:07:12.717 --> 00:07:14.548
My truck. Why, you little...

69
00:07:14.719 --> 00:07:17.017
Shaw, no shooting in town.

70
00:07:17.188 --> 00:07:21.420
But, Gordy, that bear leaned over
and untied my buck.

71
00:07:21.593 --> 00:07:26.053
- Didn't you see that?
- All I see is a busted headlight.

72
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:31.258
Shaw, you've been living
in the woods too long.

73
00:07:35.306 --> 00:07:39.800
They can't tell me what I seen,
because only I know what I seen.

74
00:07:40.445 --> 00:07:45.144
<i>Wheel of Fortune!</i>

75
00:07:48.686 --> 00:07:51.280
Big money got to come. Come on.

76
00:07:51.456 --> 00:07:54.687
<i>- Okay, buddy, time for bed.
- Five hundred...</i>

77
00:07:54.859 --> 00:07:56.952
<i>- There's no R...
- Boog.</i>

78
00:07:57.128 --> 00:07:59.358
Mr. Dinkleman's waiting.

79
00:08:10.642 --> 00:08:12.803
Good night, big guy.

80
00:08:15.179 --> 00:08:18.444
Oh, did I forget something?

81
00:08:23.888 --> 00:08:26.982
No, no, no. No more treats for you.

82
00:08:27.158 --> 00:08:29.558
No, stop it.

83
00:08:30.728 --> 00:08:33.959
Not the face.
Oh, no, not the eyebrows too.

84
00:08:34.132 --> 00:08:37.067
No, it's not gonna work this time.
Stop it. I'm serious, Boog.

85
00:08:37.235 --> 00:08:41.569
It's cute, but no... All right.

86
00:08:44.809 --> 00:08:49.678
<i>If you go out in the woods today
You're sure of a big surprise</i>

87
00:08:49.847 --> 00:08:54.910
<i>If you go out in the woods today
You'd better go in disguise</i>

88
00:08:55.086 --> 00:08:57.452
<i>For every bear
That ever there was</i>

89
00:08:57.655 --> 00:09:00.283
<i>Will gather there together because</i>

90
00:09:00.458 --> 00:09:02.255
<i>Today's the day</i>

91
00:09:02.427 --> 00:09:09.492
<i>The teddy bears have their picnic</i>

92
00:09:09.934 --> 00:09:12.232
Good night, Boog.

93
00:09:20.678 --> 00:09:22.077
Who's there?

94
00:09:25.516 --> 00:09:28.644
I'm warning you. I got ten claws
and I ain't afraid to use them.

95
00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:32.449
- Hey, buddy. It's me, Elliot.
- What are you doing here?

96
00:09:32.623 --> 00:09:34.386
You helped me,
I'm returning the favor.

97
00:09:34.559 --> 00:09:37.187
I'm busting you out of here.
Let's go. Let's do this.

98
00:09:37.829 --> 00:09:40.491
Come on. Let's book it before
the warden makes her rounds.

99
00:09:40.665 --> 00:09:43.600
No, cornflake.
You've got it all twisted.

100
00:09:43.768 --> 00:09:49.035
- This here is my home.
- Sweet.

101
00:09:49.207 --> 00:09:51.300
Now haul your little butt
back out that window.

102
00:09:51.476 --> 00:09:53.410
- What's this?
- Get off of that.

103
00:09:54.045 --> 00:09:57.913
So soft. What is that?

104
00:09:59.917 --> 00:10:01.646
What are you doing in there?

105
00:10:02.053 --> 00:10:03.611
This place is big enough for two.

106
00:10:03.788 --> 00:10:06.086
- What?
- Wow, look at that.

107
00:10:06.257 --> 00:10:08.589
Does this look natural?

108
00:10:09.393 --> 00:10:11.861
- Give me that.
- Oh, who's this little guy?

109
00:10:12.029 --> 00:10:14.520
- Dinkleman.
- Dinkleman?

110
00:10:14.699 --> 00:10:17.190
Is Dinkleman your doll?

111
00:10:17.368 --> 00:10:20.132
I don't care about that old thing.

112
00:10:24.542 --> 00:10:27.238
Oh, I get it. You're like a pet.

113
00:10:27.411 --> 00:10:31.108
- I ain't nobody's pet.
- Right.

114
00:10:31.282 --> 00:10:35.241
I do what I want, when I want,
and I come and go as I please.

115
00:10:35.419 --> 00:10:37.546
Well, then let's go.

116
00:10:39.657 --> 00:10:41.318
Outside?

117
00:10:41.492 --> 00:10:45.724
Why would I wanna go outside
when I got all I need in...

118
00:10:47.865 --> 00:10:49.662
Whoa, what's that?

119
00:10:49.834 --> 00:10:51.927
I call them Woo Hoos, like:

120
00:10:53.404 --> 00:10:54.632
You want one?

121
00:10:54.806 --> 00:10:58.469
I know where there's a bunch of them,
but you gotta go...

122
00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:01.674
...outside.

123
00:11:03.481 --> 00:11:06.917
Inside. Outside.

124
00:11:07.084 --> 00:11:09.348
- Inside. Outside.
- Stop it.

125
00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:13.286
- Stupid nose.
- Inside. Outsi...

126
00:11:26.337 --> 00:11:29.670
Okay, I got that Woo Hoo right out of
one of those container doohickeys.

127
00:11:29.841 --> 00:11:32.332
You got that out the garbage?

128
00:11:32.777 --> 00:11:35.610
I had that in my mouth
and everything.

129
00:11:36.247 --> 00:11:39.045
Dude, you're freaking me out
with that nose thing.

130
00:11:42.453 --> 00:11:43.715
- Whoa.
- What is it?

131
00:11:43.888 --> 00:11:47.346
- It's a whole Woo Hoo village.
- Sweet.

132
00:11:49.727 --> 00:11:52.491
It's locked. Maybe we should
come back tomorrow.

133
00:11:52.663 --> 00:11:53.960
Hey.

134
00:11:55.499 --> 00:11:58.730
Elliot, look what you... You did.

135
00:11:58.903 --> 00:12:01.770
You gonna get us in some trouble.

136
00:12:04.208 --> 00:12:06.142
The Woo Hoo bar.

137
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:09.279
She's my lady. Smooth and creamy.

138
00:12:09.447 --> 00:12:12.678
So bad, I shouldn't. Yet I will.

139
00:12:22.526 --> 00:12:24.153
What is that?

140
00:12:24.328 --> 00:12:26.159
Whoa, let me try.

141
00:12:30.635 --> 00:12:32.762
Boog. Boog?

142
00:12:34.372 --> 00:12:38.502
- Hello, idiot.
- It's "Elliot."

143
00:13:01.532 --> 00:13:03.727
I come in peace.

144
00:13:28.893 --> 00:13:30.360
I'm foraging.

145
00:13:30.561 --> 00:13:32.085
Pepperoni!

146
00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:48.276
- All right. Yeah, there it is. Let's go.
- Boog, party's over, let's go.

147
00:13:50.748 --> 00:13:54.115
- All right, yeah, there it is.
- Freeze.

148
00:13:56.220 --> 00:14:02.318
Behold, the mighty grizzly.
Good night.

149
00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:21.676
<i>If you go out in the woods today
There's gonna be some fries</i>

150
00:14:25.116 --> 00:14:26.845
Yeah, and the giraffes...

151
00:14:27.018 --> 00:14:30.545
...they taste almost exactly
like the elephants.

152
00:14:30.721 --> 00:14:32.916
That's messed up.

153
00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:34.785
Hey, Gordy.

154
00:14:38.462 --> 00:14:41.761
Back up quick, before she sees me.

155
00:14:48.239 --> 00:14:50.571
You're in big trouble, mister.

156
00:14:54.178 --> 00:14:57.272
You know what sugar does
to you, Boog.

157
00:14:57.448 --> 00:14:59.916
Straight to bed, now!

158
00:15:02.686 --> 00:15:05.849
I'm so sorry. It's my fault.
It won't happen again.

159
00:15:06.023 --> 00:15:08.685
- What if he had hurt someone?
- Gordy, please.

160
00:15:08.859 --> 00:15:12.522
- We're talking about Boog here.
- Hey, what are you looking at?

161
00:15:12.696 --> 00:15:14.891
I told you not to wait up.

162
00:15:15.066 --> 00:15:19.059
- I'll take him back to the woods.
- It's time to put him where he belongs.

163
00:15:19.236 --> 00:15:23.036
No, no, he's not ready to go back yet.
I mean, it's not my fault.

164
00:15:23.207 --> 00:15:26.108
I tried to teach him the basics.

165
00:15:26.277 --> 00:15:29.678
I took him fishing,
but he didn't wanna get wet.

166
00:15:31.115 --> 00:15:33.049
Gordy, please...

167
00:15:36.587 --> 00:15:39.454
Boog is sorry.

168
00:15:40.057 --> 00:15:44.050
- Beth, you're not his mother.
- I'm not mothering him.

169
00:15:46.497 --> 00:15:49.125
Excuse me. Go to bed, Boog!

170
00:15:55.406 --> 00:15:56.668
One more summer.

171
00:15:56.841 --> 00:15:58.866
That's all I'm asking,
one summer.

172
00:16:00.444 --> 00:16:02.537
Great, see? I can be reasonable.
Thanks.

173
00:16:02.713 --> 00:16:04.681
You know something?

174
00:16:04.849 --> 00:16:09.115
The longer you wait, the harder
it's gonna be for him to adapt.

175
00:16:09.553 --> 00:16:13.922
Oh, I'm sure he'll...
At least I think he'll...

176
00:16:14.091 --> 00:16:17.117
And the harder it's gonna be
for you to let him go.

177
00:16:21.298 --> 00:16:23.459
Good night, Beth.

178
00:16:45.122 --> 00:16:47.522
What am I gonna do with you?

179
00:17:00.938 --> 00:17:03.873
This isn't decaf. You know
what caffeine does to me, Bob.

180
00:17:04.041 --> 00:17:06.635
I'd be talking up a storm,
chatting your ear off...

181
00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:08.607
...a mile a minute
for the whole ride.

182
00:17:09.813 --> 00:17:15.445
Mr. Weenie, heel. Heel, Mr. Weenie.

183
00:17:17.388 --> 00:17:18.855
Hot.

184
00:17:24.228 --> 00:17:26.219
It's terrible but wonderful
at the same time.

185
00:17:26.397 --> 00:17:28.490
It's like freedom in a cup.

186
00:17:29.433 --> 00:17:31.333
Out of hand.

187
00:17:39.743 --> 00:17:41.734
You know, I heard Boog got loose
last night...

188
00:17:41.912 --> 00:17:43.504
...and he totally trashed the place.

189
00:17:43.681 --> 00:17:45.171
- Really?
- That's what happened.

190
00:17:45.349 --> 00:17:48.011
There's something wrong
going on here.

191
00:17:51.989 --> 00:17:55.823
You? It walks like a man.

192
00:18:03.167 --> 00:18:06.933
Hold still,
you two-legged latte drinker.

193
00:18:07.104 --> 00:18:08.332
Look out!

194
00:18:13.677 --> 00:18:15.042
Not again.

195
00:18:15.246 --> 00:18:17.806
Boog will have you eating out
of his paw.

196
00:18:19.283 --> 00:18:23.276
Get it?
"Paw," because he's a bear?

197
00:18:24.421 --> 00:18:27.322
- So anyway...
- Oh, man.

198
00:18:27.491 --> 00:18:31.222
Okay, relax, Boog.
You can do this.

199
00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:35.690
- What the...?
- I gotta hide. I gotta hide.

200
00:18:35.866 --> 00:18:38.528
What are you doing?
Get out of here. Hey.

201
00:18:38.702 --> 00:18:41.102
He's right behind me.

202
00:18:43.907 --> 00:18:47.104
I knew it.
That bear's corrupted my buck.

203
00:18:47.711 --> 00:18:49.235
Hide me.

204
00:18:55.152 --> 00:18:57.450
- All right, he's gone. Now get out.
- Good idea.

205
00:18:57.621 --> 00:19:00.351
- Where you going?
- Behold, the mighty grizzly.

206
00:19:06.397 --> 00:19:08.729
How cute, a donkey.

207
00:19:11.502 --> 00:19:15.029
- You got me in enough trouble.
- Hey, I... You saved my life.

208
00:19:15.205 --> 00:19:17.469
That means
that you're responsible for me.

209
00:19:17.641 --> 00:19:19.905
What? Stop messing up my life.

210
00:19:20.077 --> 00:19:22.102
You needed to get out.
You should thank me.

211
00:19:22.279 --> 00:19:24.509
- Thank you?
- You're welcome, buddy.

212
00:19:24.682 --> 00:19:27.150
Stop calling me that. Now get out.

213
00:19:27.318 --> 00:19:28.910
Need to hide. Need to hide.

214
00:19:29.853 --> 00:19:31.081
Boog?

215
00:19:31.755 --> 00:19:33.848
Oh, no, you don't.
You're leaving now.

216
00:19:34.024 --> 00:19:35.753
- Out of the coat. Take it off.
- No. No!

217
00:19:35.926 --> 00:19:37.860
- Take off the coat.
- No means no.

218
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:42.458
- He's eating the donkey.
- He's gonna eat us all.

219
00:19:42.633 --> 00:19:45.033
You know he's still out there.

220
00:19:45.202 --> 00:19:48.296
Eat you? He's not gonna...
Boog, what are you doing?

221
00:19:48.472 --> 00:19:50.030
Put that animal down this instant.

222
00:19:50.974 --> 00:19:53.272
- Hold still.
- No, I'm staying.

223
00:19:53.444 --> 00:19:54.672
But my show!

224
00:19:54.845 --> 00:19:56.938
Sit, Boog. You're getting a time-out.

225
00:19:57.114 --> 00:19:59.173
Do you hear me?
I'm totally getting angry.

226
00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:01.784
That guy wants to kill me.

227
00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:04.515
No, wait.

228
00:20:08.692 --> 00:20:10.159
- I chipped a hoof.
- Chipped a...?

229
00:20:10.327 --> 00:20:12.818
You chipped a... I'm gonna kill you.

230
00:20:12.996 --> 00:20:17.057
He's harmless. Really.
Stay calm. Stay calm!

231
00:20:17.234 --> 00:20:18.758
Out of my way. Move.

232
00:20:18.936 --> 00:20:21.666
Show's over,
you four-legged freaks of nature.

233
00:20:29.113 --> 00:20:30.876
Perfect.

234
00:20:31.048 --> 00:20:32.845
Shaw. Drop that gun.

235
00:20:33.016 --> 00:20:36.213
You're ruining my show.

236
00:20:36.387 --> 00:20:39.117
Easy, now. Just line them up.

237
00:20:39.289 --> 00:20:43.020
Two heads, one bullet.

238
00:20:48.365 --> 00:20:51.801
Buttermilk biscuits.

239
00:21:05.115 --> 00:21:08.243
Shaw, you're under arrest.

240
00:21:09.186 --> 00:21:10.813
Shaw?

241
00:21:17.327 --> 00:21:20.763
Gordy, I didn't know
what else to do. I...

242
00:21:20.931 --> 00:21:23.297
It's time, Beth.

243
00:21:23.467 --> 00:21:25.332
But what about hunting season?

244
00:21:25.502 --> 00:21:28.472
Take him above the falls.
He'll be safe there.

245
00:21:28.472 --> 00:21:29.530
Take him above the falls.
He'll be safe there.

246
00:23:08.705 --> 00:23:10.570
You're gonna be...

247
00:23:11.675 --> 00:23:13.905
You're gonna be fine.

248
00:23:17.648 --> 00:23:19.912
I'm gonna miss you, big guy.

249
00:24:05.362 --> 00:24:07.091
Pretty.

250
00:24:16.039 --> 00:24:19.304
Where's home? It's gone.

251
00:24:19.476 --> 00:24:21.671
Someone stole it.

252
00:24:22.279 --> 00:24:25.442
Hey, could you keep it down?

253
00:24:25.616 --> 00:24:28.483
I'm trying to sleep here.

254
00:24:31.355 --> 00:24:32.913
You.

255
00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:35.320
- No, I didn't do it.
- Take a good look, Elliot.

256
00:24:35.492 --> 00:24:37.824
What do you see, Elliot?
Something's missing, Elliot.

257
00:24:37.995 --> 00:24:39.428
What is it, Elliot? What is it?

258
00:24:39.596 --> 00:24:41.723
Wait, don't tell me. I...

259
00:24:41.898 --> 00:24:43.456
Timberline is missing!

260
00:24:43.634 --> 00:24:46.228
- I was just gonna say that.
- My garage is missing.

261
00:24:46.403 --> 00:24:48.667
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner
are missing.

262
00:24:48.839 --> 00:24:53.867
My life is missing,
and it's all your fault.

263
00:24:54.044 --> 00:24:56.444
What are you gonna do?

264
00:25:02.986 --> 00:25:04.419
You're funny.

265
00:25:04.588 --> 00:25:08.456
I thought, "Maybe," but then
I was like... and then...

266
00:25:08.825 --> 00:25:11.350
This ain't happening.
It's some kind of mistake.

267
00:25:11.528 --> 00:25:14.190
Think, Boog. She's mad,
but you can fix this.

268
00:25:14.364 --> 00:25:16.662
All right, I'll go back
and I'll give her the face.

269
00:25:16.833 --> 00:25:18.460
The face.

270
00:25:18.635 --> 00:25:21.763
Gotta get back before
she forgets the face.

271
00:25:21.938 --> 00:25:25.533
That'll clear it all up right there.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the face.

272
00:25:29.446 --> 00:25:31.175
Boog!

273
00:25:31.548 --> 00:25:34.381
You can't just go wandering
around out here.

274
00:25:34.551 --> 00:25:36.382
You don't know where you're going,
Boog!

275
00:25:36.553 --> 00:25:37.952
I'm going home.

276
00:25:38.121 --> 00:25:40.783
Wait. Boog.

277
00:25:41.158 --> 00:25:43.251
I know where Timberline is.

278
00:25:43.427 --> 00:25:47.261
- I can get you back.
- Thank you, but no thank you.

279
00:25:47.998 --> 00:25:49.727
Quiet.

280
00:25:53.203 --> 00:25:56.036
Timberline's gotta be
around here somewhere.

281
00:25:58.508 --> 00:26:00.703
Well, that was quick.

282
00:26:04.448 --> 00:26:08.748
Now, let's see.
Righty-tighty, lefty-loosey.

283
00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:12.588
Boog, is that you?

284
00:26:28.271 --> 00:26:30.330
Boog.

285
00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:42.441
Okay, I gotta get the lay of the land.

286
00:26:42.619 --> 00:26:44.553
Somehow...

287
00:26:45.155 --> 00:26:47.589
...if I get up high enough, then...

288
00:26:49.326 --> 00:26:50.759
All right.

289
00:26:50.927 --> 00:26:53.122
I can do this.

290
00:26:53.497 --> 00:26:55.965
No problem.

291
00:26:59.603 --> 00:27:02.197
Lost your way to Sunday school, pal?

292
00:27:02.372 --> 00:27:05.899
This is McSquizzy's turf.
Nobody messes with McSquizzy.

293
00:27:06.076 --> 00:27:07.839
Because that's me.

294
00:27:08.011 --> 00:27:09.979
- What?
- Touch a needle in this tree...

295
00:27:10.147 --> 00:27:13.344
...and I'll give you such a doing!
- Yeah?

296
00:27:13.517 --> 00:27:15.644
You and what army?

297
00:27:17.821 --> 00:27:19.118
Oh, that army.

298
00:27:19.289 --> 00:27:21.519
Mess not with the furrytail clan.

299
00:27:21.691 --> 00:27:25.149
Defenders of the good,
crusaders of the righteous...

300
00:27:25.328 --> 00:27:27.558
...guardians of the pine.

301
00:27:29.032 --> 00:27:31.967
Keep your tree. I'll find another one.

302
00:27:33.036 --> 00:27:37.439
Look! He's got a wee freakish twin
growing out of his back.

303
00:27:42.979 --> 00:27:45.812
Oh, this one will work.

304
00:27:45.982 --> 00:27:49.008
Hey. That was a warning, all right?

305
00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:53.180
Try that again, and I'll be kicking
your furry brown bahookie!

306
00:27:53.356 --> 00:27:55.347
- What?
- Hey, this is a different tree.

307
00:27:55.525 --> 00:27:57.152
They're all my trees.

308
00:27:57.327 --> 00:28:00.455
I suggest you turn round and head
right back from whence you came.

309
00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:03.531
That's what I'm trying to do.
So just point me the way to town...

310
00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:05.565
...and I'll be out of here.

311
00:28:09.773 --> 00:28:13.402
That's it.
You're asking for a whooping.

312
00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:15.109
Ready!

313
00:28:15.278 --> 00:28:16.768
Fire!

314
00:28:18.882 --> 00:28:21.874
Hey, Boog, look. No hands.

315
00:28:22.052 --> 00:28:23.849
I think I'm getting a sunburn,
though.

316
00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:25.282
Check it out.

317
00:28:27.757 --> 00:28:29.054
All right, where's town?

318
00:28:29.226 --> 00:28:32.855
Or what we would call this,
a moon burn.

319
00:28:33.964 --> 00:28:36.831
Look, just give me the directions.

320
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.297
I really need to get back.

321
00:28:38.468 --> 00:28:39.730
So sad.

322
00:28:39.903 --> 00:28:43.498
- Where's Timberline?
- Okay. Okay. All right.

323
00:28:43.673 --> 00:28:45.300
You got it good
in Timberline, right?

324
00:28:45.475 --> 00:28:49.036
Coffee, Woo Hoo bars, safety.

325
00:28:49.212 --> 00:28:52.579
- Yeah, so?
- And still, something is missing.

326
00:28:52.749 --> 00:28:54.444
- There is?
- Yep. Me.

327
00:28:54.618 --> 00:28:56.609
And I want in, Boog.
I'll take you to town...

328
00:28:56.786 --> 00:28:58.879
...but when we get there,
we're partners.

329
00:28:59.055 --> 00:29:01.046
Deal, partner?

330
00:29:01.224 --> 00:29:04.022
What? Oh, no, no, no.

331
00:29:04.194 --> 00:29:06.253
That ain't never
gonna happen. Never.

332
00:29:06.429 --> 00:29:08.397
Don't you have a herd
to get back to?

333
00:29:08.565 --> 00:29:12.467
What...? My herd?
They... My herd will understand.

334
00:29:12.636 --> 00:29:14.729
These guys are my...
They're my buddies.

335
00:29:14.905 --> 00:29:17.738
- They... They want the best for me.
- Forget it.

336
00:29:19.409 --> 00:29:21.673
Oh, well.
Better start moving, then.

337
00:29:21.845 --> 00:29:23.938
Because open season starts
in a few days.

338
00:29:24.114 --> 00:29:26.548
Maybe one of those hunters
can give you a ride back...

339
00:29:26.716 --> 00:29:29.116
...on the hood of their truck.

340
00:29:30.854 --> 00:29:32.845
Hunters. Dang.

341
00:29:35.358 --> 00:29:37.553
- Okay, okay.
- So we have a deal, then?

342
00:29:37.727 --> 00:29:40.025
Okay, let me hear you say it.

343
00:29:43.767 --> 00:29:46.429
- Partners?
- You're disgusting.

344
00:29:46.603 --> 00:29:48.901
- What was that?
- I...

345
00:29:49.773 --> 00:29:53.004
- Sorry, can't hear you.
- I said, I guess...

346
00:29:53.176 --> 00:29:54.734
...we can be partners.

347
00:29:54.911 --> 00:29:57.402
Partners?

348
00:30:00.984 --> 00:30:03.043
Partners.

349
00:30:03.219 --> 00:30:05.779
Okeydokey, this way!
Move it or lose it!

350
00:30:05.956 --> 00:30:08.049
You know, we should have
a secret handshake...

351
00:30:08.224 --> 00:30:10.988
...and like nicknames and stuff.
Like, cool nicknames, though.

352
00:30:11.161 --> 00:30:12.560
I'll call you Boogster...

353
00:30:12.729 --> 00:30:15.095
...and then you can call me
The Incredible Mister E.

354
00:30:15.265 --> 00:30:17.324
Isn't that great?
I came up with that myself.

355
00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.764
I made that up. You know,
this is gonna be awesome.

356
00:30:19.936 --> 00:30:21.403
It's just you and me.

357
00:30:21.571 --> 00:30:24.563
Hey, who's the lady in the shorts?

358
00:30:37.387 --> 00:30:39.651
I hope I'm not too late.

359
00:30:40.056 --> 00:30:42.217
They've been out here all night.

360
00:30:42.392 --> 00:30:44.383
A bear...

361
00:30:44.561 --> 00:30:47.257
...and a deer, working together.

362
00:30:47.597 --> 00:30:49.292
How far does this conspiracy go?

363
00:30:49.466 --> 00:30:52.128
What other animals are involved?
God bless America!

364
00:30:52.302 --> 00:30:55.271
I hope the bald eagle hasn't turned.

365
00:30:56.006 --> 00:30:57.633
No, no, no.

366
00:30:57.807 --> 00:30:59.798
Maybe they're right.

367
00:30:59.976 --> 00:31:03.343
Maybe... Maybe old Shaw is crazy.

368
00:31:03.513 --> 00:31:06.539
Yeah, maybe.

369
00:31:15.892 --> 00:31:18.861
Isn't it peaceful out here, Bob?

370
00:31:19.396 --> 00:31:22.194
You're right, Bob. Let's not spoil
the beauty of this moment...

371
00:31:22.365 --> 00:31:23.593
...with idle chatter.

372
00:31:23.767 --> 00:31:26.429
Some people can just jibber-jabber
till the cows come home.

373
00:31:26.603 --> 00:31:30.039
What does that mean, Bob?
"Till the cows come home."

374
00:31:30.206 --> 00:31:32.504
Where have the cows been?

375
00:31:42.786 --> 00:31:46.415
Okay, Forest 101.

376
00:31:46.589 --> 00:31:48.682
These big wood stick things
are called trees.

377
00:31:49.292 --> 00:31:54.423
The big rocks are called mountains,
and the little rocks are their babies.

378
00:31:56.699 --> 00:31:58.599
Altitude.

379
00:32:00.203 --> 00:32:03.502
No jelly arm, no jelly arm. Come on.

380
00:32:05.141 --> 00:32:07.632
- Elliot!
- Boogster, it's...

381
00:32:07.811 --> 00:32:09.142
How many times must I say it?

382
00:32:09.312 --> 00:32:11.837
I am the Incredible Mister E.

383
00:32:12.015 --> 00:32:13.414
Elliot, please.

384
00:32:13.583 --> 00:32:15.642
Look, if you don't use
the code names...

385
00:32:15.819 --> 00:32:18.913
...how am I supposed to know that
it's really you that I'm talking to?

386
00:32:32.268 --> 00:32:34.395
Yeah, yeah. Okay, I got it.

387
00:32:34.571 --> 00:32:36.869
Nice and easy.

388
00:32:39.909 --> 00:32:42.173
Just rip it off fast, like a Band-Aid.

389
00:32:42.345 --> 00:32:44.074
Hold still, okay?

390
00:32:44.247 --> 00:32:46.875
Just be calm.
This might pinch a little.

391
00:32:47.484 --> 00:32:51.079
- Get it over with.
- You may wanna cover your ears.

392
00:32:51.254 --> 00:32:52.448
Cover my...?

393
00:32:54.624 --> 00:32:59.027
Okay, scamper on back
to the woods, little buddy.

394
00:33:01.297 --> 00:33:02.787
Buddy.

395
00:33:02.966 --> 00:33:05.833
Okay, ladies, this dam
ain't gonna build itself!

396
00:33:06.002 --> 00:33:08.334
Lift that birch.
Swing those pines over here.

397
00:33:08.505 --> 00:33:10.302
Come on. Move it!

398
00:33:10.473 --> 00:33:11.735
Yo, O'Toole!

399
00:33:11.908 --> 00:33:14.308
- Yeah, boss?
- I want you to cantilever that cedar...

400
00:33:14.477 --> 00:33:18.106
...on the bias down by the north end,
you got that?

401
00:33:19.082 --> 00:33:21.312
Put a twig in the hole.

402
00:33:21.618 --> 00:33:23.142
Rookie.

403
00:33:23.853 --> 00:33:25.377
Take five for lunch!

404
00:33:27.423 --> 00:33:29.220
- What do you got?
- Wood.

405
00:33:29.392 --> 00:33:31.883
- What do you got?
- Wood.

406
00:33:32.061 --> 00:33:33.926
You wanna trade?

407
00:33:35.632 --> 00:33:37.122
Hey, hey, guys. Check it out.

408
00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:40.360
There goes the largest carnivore
in North America.

409
00:33:40.537 --> 00:33:44.337
- The mighty grizzly.
- And he's a good dancer.

410
00:33:44.507 --> 00:33:45.940
We're gonna be in a show.

411
00:33:49.946 --> 00:33:51.675
Come here!

412
00:33:51.915 --> 00:33:53.940
Hey, that's my good antler.

413
00:33:54.117 --> 00:33:57.177
Listen, simple. We are not "we."

414
00:33:57.353 --> 00:34:00.845
It's just me.
And we ain't doing no show.

415
00:34:01.024 --> 00:34:02.389
- Diva.
- What?

416
00:34:02.559 --> 00:34:04.083
I understand what's going on here.

417
00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:06.319
You're a little crabby
because you're hungry.

418
00:34:06.496 --> 00:34:07.929
I, I...

419
00:34:09.832 --> 00:34:12.027
I think yes.

420
00:34:12.769 --> 00:34:15.397
I'm starving!

421
00:34:15.572 --> 00:34:17.472
- Here, try this.
- I can't eat that.

422
00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:19.540
Picky, picky, picky.

423
00:34:19.709 --> 00:34:21.643
Well, what do bears eat?

424
00:34:24.347 --> 00:34:28.249
Fish. Bears eat fish.

425
00:34:29.819 --> 00:34:33.516
All right, fishies, give it up for Boog!

426
00:34:51.474 --> 00:34:53.339
Hey, Incredible Mister E.

427
00:34:53.509 --> 00:34:55.875
Yes, Boogster?

428
00:34:56.045 --> 00:34:59.572
- I gotta go.
- Well, go.

429
00:34:59.749 --> 00:35:01.740
No, I need a toilet.

430
00:35:03.152 --> 00:35:05.882
You know, the think tank.

431
00:35:06.055 --> 00:35:09.547
The log cabin, the johnny
on the spot, the oval office.

432
00:35:10.326 --> 00:35:13.090
- There's none of those things out here.
- Well, what do you do?

433
00:35:13.263 --> 00:35:14.787
You know...

434
00:35:16.132 --> 00:35:18.123
...I can't remember. But listen.

435
00:35:18.301 --> 00:35:24.069
Don't look now, but I see a little bush
with your name written all over it.

436
00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:25.867
A bush? Are you serious?

437
00:35:26.042 --> 00:35:28.067
Go on. It's just like riding a bicycle.

438
00:35:28.244 --> 00:35:31.008
Only you're crapping on it.

439
00:35:32.315 --> 00:35:35.443
Show us your "grr" face, nature boy.

440
00:35:49.065 --> 00:35:51.556
Hey. What are you doing here?

441
00:35:51.734 --> 00:35:53.258
Get out of here.

442
00:35:53.436 --> 00:35:56.837
I'm working here. Now, go.

443
00:35:57.573 --> 00:35:59.404
All right, all right,
you've had your fun.

444
00:35:59.575 --> 00:36:02.442
Nothing to see here.
Let the bear do his thing.

445
00:36:03.179 --> 00:36:05.044
You believe those guys?

446
00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:08.881
Finished?

447
00:36:09.319 --> 00:36:11.378
I bet my nuts
that big hairy choob can't do it.

448
00:36:11.554 --> 00:36:14.887
- I'll take a piece of that action.
- What is wrong with you animals?

449
00:36:15.058 --> 00:36:16.355
Perhaps some roughage, buddy?

450
00:36:16.526 --> 00:36:17.754
Buddy.

451
00:36:17.927 --> 00:36:19.155
Perhaps some privacy.

452
00:36:19.329 --> 00:36:21.729
- What are doing on my house?
- This is your house?

453
00:36:21.898 --> 00:36:23.126
Oh, I... I didn't know...

454
00:36:23.299 --> 00:36:26.097
- It would be an improvement.
- What did you just say, Rosie?

455
00:36:26.269 --> 00:36:28.294
Nothing. Why you gotta
be so sensitive?

456
00:36:28.471 --> 00:36:30.769
- Boogster, what's the deal?
- You watch your mouth...

457
00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:32.737
...or you'll get yourself in trouble.

458
00:36:32.909 --> 00:36:35.036
You're just jealous
because you ain't got a man.

459
00:36:35.211 --> 00:36:37.611
I don't know.
Some kind of chick fight.

460
00:36:37.914 --> 00:36:39.279
Elliot, what do I do?

461
00:36:39.449 --> 00:36:41.849
Well, that's easy.
You just gotta mark your territory.

462
00:36:42.018 --> 00:36:44.350
- Show them who's boss.
- All right, ladies.

463
00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:46.920
I'm laying down the law.

464
00:36:47.090 --> 00:36:49.490
Unless, of course, they're skunks.

465
00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:52.459
Disgusting.

466
00:36:59.102 --> 00:37:00.797
Giselle.

467
00:37:01.604 --> 00:37:03.765
Ridiculous.

468
00:37:07.744 --> 00:37:11.111
The woods is no place for a bear.

469
00:37:11.647 --> 00:37:13.274
Ducks? Okay.

470
00:37:13.449 --> 00:37:14.848
Look, don't move.

471
00:37:17.353 --> 00:37:20.015
Oh, yeah. Sprucing up.

472
00:37:20.189 --> 00:37:23.124
Quick. You guys gotta help me.

473
00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:26.995
Don't mind Deni, monsieur.
He's a bit nervous.

474
00:37:27.163 --> 00:37:29.097
Never been quite...

475
00:37:29.532 --> 00:37:33.901
...right since the great migration.

476
00:37:34.771 --> 00:37:39.333
There were thousands of us
when we started in the big V's.

477
00:37:40.109 --> 00:37:43.408
Then... Then it happened.

478
00:37:43.579 --> 00:37:45.308
What happened?

479
00:37:45.481 --> 00:37:48.917
What happened?
Open season happened.

480
00:37:49.819 --> 00:37:51.514
Just me and Deni were left.

481
00:37:51.687 --> 00:37:55.088
How can you make a V
with only two duck, you ask, eh?

482
00:37:55.558 --> 00:37:57.719
Well, you cannot, monsieur.

483
00:37:57.894 --> 00:38:00.954
It's a tragedy!

484
00:38:01.464 --> 00:38:03.955
Yeah, right, whatever.

485
00:38:04.133 --> 00:38:06.397
But check this out.
I'm looking for town.

486
00:38:06.569 --> 00:38:09.697
Okay? Now, could one of you guys
fly up there...

487
00:38:09.872 --> 00:38:12.534
...and show me the way?
- Fly? Fly?

488
00:38:13.409 --> 00:38:15.741
Quiet. They'll hear you.

489
00:38:17.046 --> 00:38:18.274
Giselle.

490
00:38:18.448 --> 00:38:20.382
- Elliot?
- Hey, gorgeous.

491
00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:23.383
- How you doing?
- Elliot, where have you been?

492
00:38:23.553 --> 00:38:26.078
Oh, you know. Big city.

493
00:38:26.255 --> 00:38:29.747
Kind of a road trip. Saw the sights,
hit the buffet, took in a show.

494
00:38:29.926 --> 00:38:31.450
Things are looking up, Giselle.

495
00:38:31.627 --> 00:38:34.187
Really? I heard
you got hit by a truck.

496
00:38:36.599 --> 00:38:37.930
That... Rumor.

497
00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:40.568
You better get out of here.
Remember what happened...

498
00:38:40.736 --> 00:38:42.931
...last time you talked to me?
- Is lan around?

499
00:38:46.542 --> 00:38:48.737
How long have you had that tic?

500
00:38:49.045 --> 00:38:50.603
I think it's getting worse.

501
00:38:51.914 --> 00:38:53.142
Oh, crud.

502
00:38:57.787 --> 00:39:00.017
Hello, "Smelliot."

503
00:39:01.657 --> 00:39:04.125
I called him Smelliot.

504
00:39:05.027 --> 00:39:08.485
Herd! Circle formation!

505
00:39:09.832 --> 00:39:11.857
You pinheads. That's an oval.

506
00:39:12.034 --> 00:39:14.798
More circle-y!

507
00:39:15.571 --> 00:39:17.630
You got a lot of nerve
coming back here.

508
00:39:17.807 --> 00:39:21.140
- Why, thank you.
- That was not a compliment, maggot!

509
00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:23.210
Well, he was just going.
Right, Elliot?

510
00:39:23.379 --> 00:39:24.641
Yeah, lan.

511
00:39:24.814 --> 00:39:28.341
I had to stop by and say hello
to some of my old pals.

512
00:39:28.518 --> 00:39:30.509
Bob, Kevin. Jurgen,
how's the knee?

513
00:39:30.686 --> 00:39:35.020
I told you to leave the herd
and never, ever, ever...

514
00:39:35.191 --> 00:39:38.820
- Never?
- Never, ever, ever come back.

515
00:39:38.995 --> 00:39:40.519
Back?

516
00:39:40.997 --> 00:39:42.862
I'm not... I'm not back.

517
00:39:43.499 --> 00:39:45.694
Me and my best buddy
are heading to town.

518
00:39:45.868 --> 00:39:49.133
Yeah. I sure am gonna miss
you guys.

519
00:39:49.305 --> 00:39:50.602
Off the upholstery!

520
00:39:51.807 --> 00:39:53.707
What now?

521
00:39:58.814 --> 00:40:04.013
So as I was saying,
never, ever, ever...

522
00:40:05.354 --> 00:40:07.549
A bear! Bear. Bear. A bear.

523
00:40:08.391 --> 00:40:10.951
Elliot, are you all right?

524
00:40:11.127 --> 00:40:13.857
Buttermilk biscuit.

525
00:40:14.063 --> 00:40:16.554
Hey, lan. Get a load of this.

526
00:40:16.732 --> 00:40:18.131
Hey, cut it out.

527
00:40:18.301 --> 00:40:20.667
Oh, I've heard of you.

528
00:40:20.836 --> 00:40:25.739
You're that bear that got
his butt thumped by a squirrel.

529
00:40:26.342 --> 00:40:28.936
It was... There was 20 of them.

530
00:40:29.845 --> 00:40:31.745
And they had nuts.

531
00:40:32.915 --> 00:40:34.439
Don't listen to him, Boog.

532
00:40:34.617 --> 00:40:37.484
Boog? What is that short for?

533
00:40:37.653 --> 00:40:39.883
- Booger?
- Booger!

534
00:40:40.056 --> 00:40:43.389
- Listen, you!
- I'm all ears.

535
00:40:43.926 --> 00:40:46.224
- Well...
- Boog, let's go.

536
00:40:48.064 --> 00:40:50.464
You two are perfect for each other.

537
00:40:50.633 --> 00:40:54.899
You're a loser and you're a loser-er.

538
00:40:55.371 --> 00:40:56.861
Herd, let's bound!

539
00:40:59.041 --> 00:41:00.303
Hey, Elliot.

540
00:41:00.476 --> 00:41:02.944
I think you lost something.

541
00:41:03.446 --> 00:41:06.472
Maybe it'll grow back. Bye, Elliot.

542
00:41:06.649 --> 00:41:07.911
Yeah, see you.

543
00:41:08.584 --> 00:41:12.076
See you later, backpack boy!

544
00:41:15.157 --> 00:41:17.250
That's right, fool. You better run.

545
00:41:17.426 --> 00:41:19.826
Keep on prancing,
you panty-waisted cow.

546
00:41:19.996 --> 00:41:21.987
Yeah. One more word,
and I was gonna rack him.

547
00:41:22.164 --> 00:41:23.859
- That's right.
- I was waiting for it.

548
00:41:24.033 --> 00:41:25.261
He's scared. He's scared.

549
00:41:25.434 --> 00:41:27.732
- Look at him run. Look at him run.
- Yeah, I know it.

550
00:41:27.903 --> 00:41:29.234
Look at him go.

551
00:41:29.405 --> 00:41:31.805
Are you not gonna buy him a drink
before you kiss him?

552
00:41:31.974 --> 00:41:34.408
You big jessie.

553
00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:40.847
On your bikes,
you big numpties.

554
00:42:11.113 --> 00:42:16.107
That was lan's girl
you was trying to talk to, huh?

555
00:42:18.621 --> 00:42:20.282
You dog.

556
00:42:22.024 --> 00:42:24.788
Lan's right. I'm a loser.

557
00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:26.552
- No, you're not a loser.
- Yes, I am.

558
00:42:26.729 --> 00:42:28.458
- No, you're not.
- Yes.

559
00:42:28.631 --> 00:42:32.226
Trust me. You know the day I met you,
lan kicked me out of the herd.

560
00:42:32.401 --> 00:42:36.235
I lost my antler, I got run over
and tied to the hood of a truck.

561
00:42:36.405 --> 00:42:37.736
What do you call that?

562
00:42:39.008 --> 00:42:41.806
A loser. But check this out.

563
00:42:41.977 --> 00:42:44.502
Behold, the mighty grizzly.

564
00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:47.012
I look like a bear, I talk like a bear.

565
00:42:47.183 --> 00:42:50.812
But I can't fish, I can't climb a tree,
I can't even go in the woods.

566
00:42:50.986 --> 00:42:54.581
That's nothing. Half doe.
Half buck. I'm a duck.

567
00:42:54.757 --> 00:42:56.452
Hey, I ride a unicycle for crackers!

568
00:42:56.625 --> 00:42:58.752
- I have a glass eye.
- I can't snap.

569
00:42:58.928 --> 00:43:01.863
- I thought "log" was a color.
- I can't see my feet.

570
00:43:02.031 --> 00:43:04.431
I killed a man.

571
00:43:14.543 --> 00:43:16.067
Well, at least you've got a home.

572
00:43:17.113 --> 00:43:18.978
Home. Yeah.

573
00:43:19.148 --> 00:43:21.241
I sure hope so.

574
00:43:23.185 --> 00:43:26.052
- Crimenently! Was that your neck?
- No.

575
00:43:28.557 --> 00:43:31.355
My fishy crackers.
Oh, she still loves me.

576
00:43:31.527 --> 00:43:33.154
Thank you, Beth.

577
00:43:33.329 --> 00:43:35.263
I'm coming home.

578
00:43:37.299 --> 00:43:39.358
Try one, partner. Yeah.

579
00:43:39.535 --> 00:43:42.368
Woo Hoo bars they ain't,
but they take you back.

580
00:43:42.538 --> 00:43:44.233
You know? Remind you of home.

581
00:43:44.406 --> 00:43:47.068
Sweet, salty home.

582
00:43:50.279 --> 00:43:55.114
Oh, yeah. To be back
in my own soft bed.

583
00:43:55.918 --> 00:44:00.184
Eight square meals a day,
plus snacks.

584
00:44:00.356 --> 00:44:02.256
Beth tucking me in every night.

585
00:44:02.725 --> 00:44:05.125
It's like heaven to me.

586
00:44:07.530 --> 00:44:12.229
You know,
when we get back home tomorrow...

587
00:44:12.401 --> 00:44:15.097
...l'm gonna make things right
with Beth.

588
00:44:15.271 --> 00:44:19.002
And maybe, just maybe...

589
00:44:20.376 --> 00:44:23.311
...we'll find a place
for you in the garage with me.

590
00:44:23.479 --> 00:44:26.471
Sweet! Oh, yeah. I'm in the garage.

591
00:44:26.649 --> 00:44:28.708
Who's staying in the garage?
I'm in the garage.

592
00:44:28.884 --> 00:44:31.717
Who's got a place in the garage?
It's me. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah...

593
00:44:31.887 --> 00:44:33.616
- Hey, buddy?
- Yeah?

594
00:44:33.789 --> 00:44:38.852
Do me a favor, will you?
It's gonna sound silly, but will you...?

595
00:44:39.028 --> 00:44:40.461
- Ah, forget it.
- What?

596
00:44:40.629 --> 00:44:42.256
Come on. I'm here for you.

597
00:44:42.431 --> 00:44:46.527
Will you sing me
that "teddy-bear picnic" song?

598
00:44:46.702 --> 00:44:49.830
Absolutely. The what song?

599
00:44:50.005 --> 00:44:53.304
Well, Beth always sings it to me,
you know, because it helps me sleep.

600
00:44:53.475 --> 00:44:57.468
- Okay. I'll give it a shot.
- Thanks.

601
00:44:59.315 --> 00:45:03.115
<i>Once there was a magical elf
Who lived in a rainbow tree</i>

602
00:45:03.285 --> 00:45:05.810
<i>He lived downstairs
From a flatulent dwarf</i>

603
00:45:05.988 --> 00:45:07.888
<i>Who was constantly having to pee</i>

604
00:45:08.057 --> 00:45:10.548
<i>One day the elf could take no more</i>

605
00:45:10.726 --> 00:45:13.217
<i>So he went and banged
On the rude dwarf's door</i>

606
00:45:13.395 --> 00:45:18.992
<i>And what do you know
They suddenly both were married</i>

607
00:45:24.306 --> 00:45:25.637
Good night, Boog.

608
00:45:26.575 --> 00:45:32.673
I'm sleeping in the garage.
I'm sleeping in the garage.

609
00:45:36.285 --> 00:45:40.585
Come on, Mr. Weenie.
Beg. You can do it.

610
00:45:40.756 --> 00:45:42.883
Come on. Beg.

611
00:45:43.058 --> 00:45:46.357
Bob, he won't listen.
Bob, show him how to beg.

612
00:45:59.441 --> 00:46:00.908
Dog worship.

613
00:46:02.044 --> 00:46:03.272
Oh, my!

614
00:46:03.445 --> 00:46:06.278
- You folks all right?
- What? No, no, no! He's...

615
00:46:06.448 --> 00:46:07.972
Taken you hostage. I know, I know.

616
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:10.311
You're safe now.
I've got the enemy neutral...

617
00:46:11.186 --> 00:46:15.680
There, there, Mr. Weenie.
Are you all right, baby?

618
00:46:15.858 --> 00:46:19.487
You're the sweetest
little weenie I ever saw.

619
00:46:20.496 --> 00:46:23.795
Don't be fooled. He's one of them.

620
00:46:24.533 --> 00:46:27.900
- Who?
- The enemy! The bear! That deer!

621
00:46:28.070 --> 00:46:29.469
All them animals!

622
00:46:29.838 --> 00:46:32.739
I have seen the future.

623
00:46:32.908 --> 00:46:37.140
It will start in small towns
like Timberline.

624
00:46:38.314 --> 00:46:40.544
<i>Soon, it'll spread.</i>

625
00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:47.450
<i>They will invade from burrows,
caves, petting zoos.</i>

626
00:46:49.558 --> 00:46:51.549
If I don't stop them...

627
00:46:51.727 --> 00:46:56.187
...it'll be a total reversal
of the natural order.

628
00:46:56.365 --> 00:47:01.302
They laugh at old Shaw,
but you'll see.

629
00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:04.906
The truth will be revealed.

630
00:47:05.074 --> 00:47:08.305
We know exactly what you mean.

631
00:47:08.477 --> 00:47:11.446
- You do?
- We're scientists. Well, of sorts.

632
00:47:11.613 --> 00:47:14.480
And we're trying to secure
photographic documentation...

633
00:47:14.650 --> 00:47:18.017
...of a real, live homo-sasquatchus.

634
00:47:18.187 --> 00:47:21.281
- Homo-say-what?
- We're looking for Bigfoot.

635
00:47:22.057 --> 00:47:27.654
Bigfoot...? I didn't realize
I was talking to a couple of wack jobs.

636
00:47:30.032 --> 00:47:33.490
Don't trust him.
Pets are double agents.

637
00:47:33.669 --> 00:47:37.503
The moment you turn your back,
he'll shiv you!

638
00:47:38.574 --> 00:47:42.943
Oh, no, he can't. We had him fixed.

639
00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:46.609
Boog?

640
00:47:48.183 --> 00:47:50.981
Boog. Are you awake?

641
00:47:52.454 --> 00:47:53.785
- I am now.
- Awesome.

642
00:47:53.956 --> 00:47:58.416
I was watching you sleep last night
and you were like a little angel.

643
00:47:58.594 --> 00:48:01.620
Except for you're fat
and snoring like:

644
00:48:05.901 --> 00:48:07.391
We're gonna work on that, though.

645
00:48:07.569 --> 00:48:10.129
I invented this cure
where you stick your whole hand...

646
00:48:10.305 --> 00:48:12.830
...in your mouth.
- How long before we get to Timberline?

647
00:48:13.475 --> 00:48:16.171
Oh, by nightfall. Easy.

648
00:48:16.345 --> 00:48:17.710
Are you sure?

649
00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:19.780
Absolutely.

650
00:48:19.948 --> 00:48:22.610
Hey, you wanna see
something stupid?

651
00:48:25.087 --> 00:48:27.487
Well, then we better get going.

652
00:48:27.656 --> 00:48:30.989
Right. We're on a tight schedule.
I'll carry your load.

653
00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:32.855
Oh, no. Whoa, wait.

654
00:48:33.028 --> 00:48:36.589
Look, you gotta be real careful with
him, okay, because he's real delicate.

655
00:48:39.668 --> 00:48:41.795
Want a fishy cracker?

656
00:48:43.572 --> 00:48:47.133
No. I'll eat when I get home.

657
00:48:48.744 --> 00:48:49.768
Listen, girlfriend.

658
00:48:49.945 --> 00:48:52.812
You wanna find a man like my Ignacio,
you gotta check your look.

659
00:48:52.981 --> 00:48:55.779
What are you saying? I'm black
and white. I go with everything.

660
00:48:55.951 --> 00:48:58.351
You go fine with everybody.
Maybe that's your problem.

661
00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:01.546
- Ain't those the same two skunks...
- I had some thoughts on the show.

662
00:49:01.723 --> 00:49:03.782
- My show?
- The lady in the shorts has gotta go.

663
00:49:03.959 --> 00:49:07.486
She's slowing us down. It's gotta
be fresh, new. I want some jazz.

664
00:49:07.663 --> 00:49:10.826
I'm the star, and the people out there
come to see me...

665
00:49:10.999 --> 00:49:12.364
...a grizzly bear.

666
00:49:15.037 --> 00:49:16.368
I see.

667
00:49:16.538 --> 00:49:20.565
You get to have the career while
I stay home and look after Dinkleman!

668
00:49:20.742 --> 00:49:22.835
He's not even mine!

669
00:49:23.278 --> 00:49:26.475
I don't get to have a dream.
Is that it?

670
00:49:28.517 --> 00:49:30.712
Buddy.

671
00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:35.418
Don't you think
I might like a little singing...

672
00:49:35.591 --> 00:49:38.219
...a little dancing, a little:
- Elliot.

673
00:49:38.393 --> 00:49:42.523
But no. All I ever hear is, "How long
until we get to Timberline, simple?

674
00:49:42.698 --> 00:49:45.633
- How long until we get home?"
- Elliot! Are those the same beavers?

675
00:49:45.801 --> 00:49:50.704
- No. All beavers look alike.
- Hey! Tiny dancer!

676
00:49:50.873 --> 00:49:53.103
Yeah, that's right! Shake it, shake it!

677
00:49:53.976 --> 00:49:56.240
- Let's see some moves!
- Elliot!

678
00:49:56.411 --> 00:49:57.503
Yeah.

679
00:49:57.679 --> 00:50:01.979
Elliot, this is the same dang dam.
We've been going in circles!

680
00:50:02.151 --> 00:50:05.052
Circle. One time around.

681
00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:07.916
You don't even know
where we're going.

682
00:50:10.192 --> 00:50:12.387
Got them, Lorraine!

683
00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:22.596
- What was that?
- Hunters?

684
00:50:22.771 --> 00:50:27.231
- What are they doing up here?
- Okay, boys. Take cover!

685
00:50:30.179 --> 00:50:32.545
- Boog, we gotta hide.
- I'm out of here.

686
00:50:32.714 --> 00:50:35.342
Boog, wait! Don't go out there!

687
00:50:35.517 --> 00:50:39.681
Hey, tubby, stop! Hey,
this ain't a load-bearing structure!

688
00:50:46.395 --> 00:50:48.056
Oh, that's bad.

689
00:50:52.034 --> 00:50:53.399
Rosie, in here.

690
00:51:09.218 --> 00:51:12.745
- Stop. Get off.
- Buddy, buddy, buddy!

691
00:51:12.921 --> 00:51:14.650
Crud.

692
00:51:28.403 --> 00:51:29.700
Shaw!

693
00:51:32.741 --> 00:51:35.767
Dinkleman!

694
00:51:39.548 --> 00:51:41.209
You're gonna be okay!

695
00:51:41.383 --> 00:51:44.375
We're gonna die and you know it.

696
00:51:49.124 --> 00:51:52.025
No one around here
to save you this time, boys!

697
00:51:52.794 --> 00:51:55.024
Paddle, Boog! Paddle!

698
00:51:57.899 --> 00:52:00.595
Grab a boulder! Grab a boulder!

699
00:52:00.769 --> 00:52:03.499
Left, left. Right!

700
00:52:04.039 --> 00:52:05.529
Oh, like you know.

701
00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:13.042
Where is he?

702
00:52:13.215 --> 00:52:15.979
He's gone. Oh, there he is.

703
00:52:16.151 --> 00:52:19.245
No, wait. There he is. There he is.

704
00:52:19.688 --> 00:52:21.155
- Why, you little...
- There he is.

705
00:52:21.323 --> 00:52:22.813
Quiet, I'm trying to drive.

706
00:52:28.864 --> 00:52:30.593
Faster, Boog!

707
00:52:31.767 --> 00:52:34.736
Like fishing and hunting
at the same time.

708
00:52:48.650 --> 00:52:52.484
- Give me a hand, Boog! Hold me!
- Stop. Get off! Elliot, get off. Get off!

709
00:52:52.921 --> 00:52:54.411
Stop!

710
00:53:36.732 --> 00:53:38.666
Dinkleman?

711
00:53:56.084 --> 00:53:59.178
You. You did this.

712
00:53:59.354 --> 00:54:01.015
- Yeah, that's right.
- What did I do?

713
00:54:01.189 --> 00:54:03.123
You dragged us down
to the hunting grounds.

714
00:54:03.291 --> 00:54:06.488
- Yeah, where are we gonna hide?
- We're sitting ducks out here.

715
00:54:06.661 --> 00:54:08.094
And it's open season!

716
00:54:08.263 --> 00:54:11.164
All right, all right. That's enough.

717
00:54:11.333 --> 00:54:12.994
Guys, it's not his fault.

718
00:54:13.168 --> 00:54:15.261
Oh, you're right, Elliot. It's your fault.

719
00:54:15.604 --> 00:54:16.832
- My fault?
- Yeah.

720
00:54:17.272 --> 00:54:19.399
If it weren't for you
I'd be home right now.

721
00:54:19.574 --> 00:54:21.132
None of this
would've ever happened.

722
00:54:21.309 --> 00:54:24.107
You said you knew the way back,
but you lied.

723
00:54:24.613 --> 00:54:27.878
I... No.

724
00:54:28.250 --> 00:54:29.649
Okay.

725
00:54:29.818 --> 00:54:31.718
Okay, maybe...

726
00:54:32.187 --> 00:54:34.985
I thought if you hung out with me
then maybe you would like me.

727
00:54:35.157 --> 00:54:38.558
Oh, man. I trusted you, Elliot.

728
00:54:38.727 --> 00:54:40.786
I'm sorry, Boog.

729
00:54:41.229 --> 00:54:43.254
We're still partners, right?

730
00:54:43.432 --> 00:54:46.196
You know, Elliot, I'm better off alone.

731
00:54:47.903 --> 00:54:49.336
What about us?

732
00:54:49.504 --> 00:54:51.472
- Yeah.
- Yeah, what about us?

733
00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:53.801
Us? There's no us.

734
00:54:53.975 --> 00:54:57.376
You're not my problem.
And you? We're done.

735
00:54:57.546 --> 00:55:00.640
- But... Boog, wait.
- Done.

736
00:56:28.670 --> 00:56:31.070
- Oh, no.
- Thanks for the license, Gordy.

737
00:56:31.239 --> 00:56:33.002
All right, guys. Good luck.

738
00:56:33.174 --> 00:56:37.440
- Hey, Earl. That a new truck?
- Yeah. Check it out. Jealous much?

739
00:56:39.047 --> 00:56:40.412
You okay?

740
00:56:40.582 --> 00:56:42.982
I put him way above the falls.

741
00:56:43.852 --> 00:56:45.513
I hope I did the right thing.

742
00:56:45.687 --> 00:56:50.215
Don't worry, Beth. I'm sure Boog
is happy in his new home.

743
00:56:52.794 --> 00:56:54.591
Stupid nature.

744
00:56:57.098 --> 00:56:58.690
Civilization.

745
00:57:04.072 --> 00:57:05.733
Hello?

746
00:57:05.907 --> 00:57:09.502
Excuse me. Is anybody home?

747
00:57:16.418 --> 00:57:18.909
Oh, sweet porcelain.

748
00:57:27.963 --> 00:57:31.126
And the crowd goes wild!

749
00:57:34.102 --> 00:57:36.900
Now, there's gotta be
a fridge in here somewhere.

750
00:58:31.393 --> 00:58:32.621
Oh, no.

751
00:58:32.794 --> 00:58:37.128
Deers, skunks, beavers.

752
00:58:37.766 --> 00:58:40.098
I gotta hide.

753
00:58:42.637 --> 00:58:45.367
That bear's turned them all.

754
00:58:56.718 --> 00:59:01.314
Here you go, Lorraine.
There, you get good and dry.

755
00:59:01.489 --> 00:59:05.391
Come morning,
we got a rebellion to crush.

756
00:59:05.894 --> 00:59:09.386
And then I'm gonna
take back what's mine!

757
00:59:09.564 --> 00:59:11.555
Elliot.

758
00:59:17.806 --> 00:59:20.104
Someone's been eating my candy.

759
00:59:26.247 --> 00:59:28.545
Somebody's been sitting in my chair.

760
00:59:35.023 --> 00:59:37.423
Somebody forgot to flush!

761
00:59:41.930 --> 00:59:45.127
And he's still here.

762
00:59:46.234 --> 00:59:50.500
Come back for your bear,
Goldilocks?

763
00:59:56.177 --> 01:00:02.082
Ready or not, here I come!

764
01:00:07.756 --> 01:00:14.525
<i>If you go out in the woods today
You're sure of a big surprise</i>

765
01:00:15.797 --> 01:00:23.260
<i>If you go out in the woods today
You better go in disguise</i>

766
01:00:23.605 --> 01:00:27.200
<i>'Cause every bear
That ever there was</i>

767
01:00:28.276 --> 01:00:33.111
<i>Was gathered there
Together because</i>

768
01:00:33.481 --> 01:00:37.713
<i>Today's the day
The teddy bears have</i>

769
01:00:37.886 --> 01:00:42.550
<i>Their picnic!</i>

770
01:01:08.917 --> 01:01:15.083
Hey, bear! There ain't nowhere
that you can hide from me!

771
01:01:23.431 --> 01:01:25.228
As soon as I get mine:

772
01:01:26.167 --> 01:01:27.395
Blowing their heads off!

773
01:01:27.569 --> 01:01:28.968
Good time.

774
01:01:51.793 --> 01:01:53.351
Elliot.

775
01:02:04.572 --> 01:02:06.972
No buddy.

776
01:02:22.023 --> 01:02:23.752
Elliot, you've gotta hide.

777
01:02:25.426 --> 01:02:27.485
The hunters are here.

778
01:02:38.206 --> 01:02:40.231
He's gonna give us away.

779
01:02:42.977 --> 01:02:45.969
All right! Bring it! Bring it!

780
01:02:46.414 --> 01:02:48.075
- Boog?
- Hey, buddy.

781
01:02:48.249 --> 01:02:49.682
What are you doing back here?

782
01:02:49.851 --> 01:02:51.910
Come on. I couldn't go home
without my partner.

783
01:02:52.086 --> 01:02:54.077
- I don't have a partner.
- Elliot.

784
01:02:54.255 --> 01:02:57.383
I don't need the herd
and I don't need you.

785
01:02:57.558 --> 01:02:59.048
So leave me alone.

786
01:03:00.428 --> 01:03:02.089
Ain't gonna be able to do it.

787
01:03:02.263 --> 01:03:04.288
You see, I already saved you once.

788
01:03:04.465 --> 01:03:08.492
That makes me responsible for you.

789
01:03:08.670 --> 01:03:12.265
I saw that. Come on.
Let me hear you say it. Partners.

790
01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:14.533
- No.
- What was that?

791
01:03:15.176 --> 01:03:17.644
- I guess we can be partners.
- Sorry, I can't hear you.

792
01:03:17.812 --> 01:03:19.780
I said I guess we can be partners.

793
01:03:21.416 --> 01:03:24.078
- Partners!
- Partners!

794
01:03:24.552 --> 01:03:26.747
Okeydokey. This way.

795
01:03:26.921 --> 01:03:30.049
- This way.
- Right. Maybe you better lead.

796
01:03:30.224 --> 01:03:33.921
Yeah. Let's get back to the garage,
where it's safe.

797
01:03:34.095 --> 01:03:36.393
- Safe?
- Safe?

798
01:03:39.267 --> 01:03:43.226
Hey, Boog. How many animals
can fit in the garage?

799
01:03:43.404 --> 01:03:44.462
How many...?

800
01:03:44.906 --> 01:03:46.897
Hello, Boog.

801
01:03:47.976 --> 01:03:50.843
So where you all headed?

802
01:03:51.012 --> 01:03:54.778
- To the safe place.
- This land of garage.

803
01:03:54.949 --> 01:03:57.816
- With buddy.
- Come on. You owe us, Tiny.

804
01:03:57.986 --> 01:03:59.453
- Yeah!
- Yeah! That's right!

805
01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:02.987
Yeah, I'm sorry about the dam.

806
01:04:03.157 --> 01:04:08.151
And how I messed you all up,
you know. My bad.

807
01:04:08.329 --> 01:04:11.924
So you're taking us with you,
right, Booger?

808
01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:14.898
Please? Please.

809
01:04:15.069 --> 01:04:19.768
Look at me. I'm too pretty to die!

810
01:04:20.608 --> 01:04:22.508
Well, maybe...

811
01:04:24.712 --> 01:04:26.270
No! No! No!

812
01:04:26.447 --> 01:04:28.278
You ain't leaving without us.

813
01:04:28.449 --> 01:04:30.076
I didn't mean to call you Booger.

814
01:04:30.251 --> 01:04:33.948
- Can we take Giselle?
- Wait! Let me think.

815
01:04:35.323 --> 01:04:36.813
Hunters.

816
01:04:37.458 --> 01:04:41.121
Dang. Nobody's going home tonight.

817
01:04:41.295 --> 01:04:42.922
There's so many of them.

818
01:04:43.097 --> 01:04:45.224
That's it, then.

819
01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:47.664
No more me.

820
01:04:50.738 --> 01:04:53.036
I guess I will be mounted on a wall.

821
01:04:56.978 --> 01:04:59.242
Oh, no, you won't.

822
01:04:59.414 --> 01:05:01.905
Now, when I'm a bearskin rug,
they can walk all over me.

823
01:05:02.083 --> 01:05:05.177
But until that happens,
I ain't going out without a fight.

824
01:05:05.453 --> 01:05:06.681
- What?
- Fight?

825
01:05:06.854 --> 01:05:09.015
- The F word?
- That's right.

826
01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:10.817
One thing you all have taught me...

827
01:05:11.259 --> 01:05:14.524
...the woods is a messed-up,
dangerous place.

828
01:05:15.696 --> 01:05:20.065
And y'all are crazy. You've been
kicking my butt for the last two days.

829
01:05:20.635 --> 01:05:21.624
Yeah, I kind of did.

830
01:05:21.803 --> 01:05:23.031
- I didn't.
- Sorry.

831
01:05:23.204 --> 01:05:25.536
So let's do to them
what you've been doing to me.

832
01:05:25.706 --> 01:05:29.198
Now, I say we give our guests
the full outdoor experience.

833
01:05:29.377 --> 01:05:31.106
Yeah!

834
01:05:31.279 --> 01:05:34.874
Hey! Is this a private fight
or can anybody join?

835
01:05:35.049 --> 01:05:37.244
Because McSquizzy wants in.

836
01:05:38.252 --> 01:05:40.186
Good. Because we'll need your nuts.

837
01:05:40.354 --> 01:05:42.948
- And your acorns too.
- What's the plan, Boog?

838
01:05:43.124 --> 01:05:45.388
Oh, we gonna run
those yahoos back to town.

839
01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:50.054
Yeah, baby. When we get through
with them, they won't ever come back.

840
01:05:54.302 --> 01:05:57.601
So you think you're so tough, huh?

841
01:06:00.007 --> 01:06:02.032
Well, you know what I think?

842
01:06:02.210 --> 01:06:05.976
I think you're still
just a mama's bear.

843
01:06:14.355 --> 01:06:17.415
You guard the fort, Mr. Weenie.
Mama's gonna take a dip.

844
01:06:18.993 --> 01:06:22.224
That's good.
Mama's getting kind of gamey.

845
01:06:22.396 --> 01:06:26.196
Come on, Bob. There's gonna be
a full moon out tonight.

846
01:06:33.174 --> 01:06:35.768
- Sorry.
- Come on. Let's go.

847
01:06:44.685 --> 01:06:45.913
Boog?

848
01:06:49.423 --> 01:06:51.220
Oh, yeah.

849
01:06:52.693 --> 01:06:56.060
- Maria, let go.
- I'll carry it.

850
01:06:56.230 --> 01:06:57.993
It's empty.

851
01:06:58.166 --> 01:06:59.428
Ladies.

852
01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:02.433
Heave-ho, heave-ho.

853
01:07:06.073 --> 01:07:08.098
This is gonna be great.

854
01:07:11.179 --> 01:07:13.511
You. We gonna need more ducks.

855
01:07:13.681 --> 01:07:16.172
Elliot, is that chocolate on your face?

856
01:07:16.350 --> 01:07:17.977
No.

857
01:07:19.854 --> 01:07:21.879
- It's a pet.
- He's gonna blow our cover.

858
01:07:25.893 --> 01:07:29.090
I've been living a lie!

859
01:07:29.797 --> 01:07:32.789
Please, take me with you.

860
01:07:58.826 --> 01:08:02.159
Hey, Boog. You're not still mad
about that backpack thing, are you?

861
01:08:02.330 --> 01:08:06.630
Oh, no. I never hold a grudge.
I just let them go.

862
01:08:07.735 --> 01:08:08.724
What was that?

863
01:08:11.939 --> 01:08:13.634
It's the signal.

864
01:08:17.578 --> 01:08:20.775
Okay, Deni. Let's round them up!

865
01:08:20.948 --> 01:08:23.815
All right, ladies. Let her rip!

866
01:08:34.595 --> 01:08:36.654
- Gas mask.
- Got it!

867
01:08:42.303 --> 01:08:43.531
My pants!

868
01:08:44.939 --> 01:08:46.873
Good job, Reilly. All right.

869
01:08:47.041 --> 01:08:49.703
Time to run
these guys back to town.

870
01:08:50.678 --> 01:08:51.940
Are you ready for this?

871
01:08:52.113 --> 01:08:56.812
- This is awkward.
- Yes. Yes, it is.

872
01:08:59.487 --> 01:09:01.921
- Can I?
- Go for it, Smelliot.

873
01:09:02.089 --> 01:09:04.250
Charge!

874
01:09:06.327 --> 01:09:09.592
Holy stampede! It's a stampede!

875
01:09:10.097 --> 01:09:12.429
All right. Show me your "grr" face!

876
01:09:15.102 --> 01:09:16.763
Now, let's kick
some hunter bahookie!

877
01:09:18.873 --> 01:09:20.704
Bob, we've been robbed!

878
01:09:20.875 --> 01:09:22.934
And they took Mr. Weenie!

879
01:09:23.778 --> 01:09:26.713
Come on, mate!
Move them pudgy wee legs!

880
01:09:26.881 --> 01:09:29.577
I feel so alive!

881
01:09:30.017 --> 01:09:32.349
Drop antlers!

882
01:09:42.196 --> 01:09:43.424
Bless me.

883
01:09:47.935 --> 01:09:50.597
No! No!

884
01:09:52.340 --> 01:09:53.568
How you doing, partner?

885
01:09:53.741 --> 01:09:56.938
Boog, this is great.
Let's do this every year.

886
01:10:04.719 --> 01:10:06.983
No, no! Get that bill away from me.

887
01:10:12.793 --> 01:10:14.124
Fire!

888
01:10:16.230 --> 01:10:18.357
Guys, let's get out of here!

889
01:10:31.946 --> 01:10:33.174
Sheriff! Sheriff!

890
01:10:33.347 --> 01:10:36.714
The animals are going wild,
and the bear is their leader!

891
01:10:37.885 --> 01:10:39.250
It's for you.

892
01:10:41.222 --> 01:10:42.883
Gordy, I'm bringing him home.

893
01:10:43.057 --> 01:10:45.821
Come on, men!
They're just animals.

894
01:10:47.962 --> 01:10:49.657
Elliot, catch.

895
01:10:51.265 --> 01:10:52.857
Got it.

896
01:10:53.768 --> 01:10:55.895
Present arms!

897
01:10:57.972 --> 01:11:01.135
Yeah!

898
01:11:03.344 --> 01:11:04.834
Fire!

899
01:11:06.347 --> 01:11:07.712
Oh, my God!

900
01:11:09.116 --> 01:11:10.344
Back to the trucks!

901
01:11:10.518 --> 01:11:12.486
Boog, it's working.

902
01:11:12.653 --> 01:11:14.245
Yeah. Look at them run.

903
01:11:14.422 --> 01:11:16.890
- Send in Mr. Happy!
- Who?

904
01:11:18.325 --> 01:11:19.792
Go, go, go!

905
01:11:22.663 --> 01:11:24.426
Adieu!

906
01:11:29.003 --> 01:11:30.766
Mr. Happy didn't go off.

907
01:11:30.938 --> 01:11:33.566
Hey, whoa. We're just supposed
to run them into town.

908
01:11:33.741 --> 01:11:38.542
Well, it's time for them
to start running, isn't it?

909
01:11:44.952 --> 01:11:47.819
Hey, Earl, ain't that your truck?

910
01:11:49.623 --> 01:11:51.250
That's a bummer.

911
01:12:02.369 --> 01:12:05.099
That's right. Keep running.

912
01:12:07.107 --> 01:12:08.438
Sweet.

913
01:12:08.609 --> 01:12:10.577
Freedom!

914
01:12:25.593 --> 01:12:29.051
Hello, Goldilocks.

915
01:12:29.230 --> 01:12:30.492
What?

916
01:12:32.533 --> 01:12:34.160
Bull's-eye!

917
01:12:38.939 --> 01:12:41.066
Quick! We need more ammo.

918
01:12:44.845 --> 01:12:47.541
Elliot! Elliot, stop helping me.

919
01:12:47.715 --> 01:12:51.082
- Keep it coming.
- Okay. Let's see how you like it.

920
01:12:51.819 --> 01:12:53.548
A pillow? Oh, come on!

921
01:12:53.721 --> 01:12:55.655
More! More!

922
01:12:59.693 --> 01:13:01.126
All right.

923
01:13:01.295 --> 01:13:03.126
Come on, mama's bear.

924
01:13:03.297 --> 01:13:06.357
You can do better than that.
Let's see what you got.

925
01:13:07.668 --> 01:13:08.965
Come on.

926
01:13:10.571 --> 01:13:12.300
Boog!

927
01:13:18.145 --> 01:13:21.911
Oh, yeah. Don't mess
with the Boogster. Fore!

928
01:13:23.717 --> 01:13:25.548
All right, Lorraine.

929
01:13:25.719 --> 01:13:28.517
Let's kiss this bear good night.

930
01:13:52.279 --> 01:13:54.611
No! No! Stop!

931
01:14:03.057 --> 01:14:04.524
Elliot?

932
01:14:09.763 --> 01:14:11.196
Buddy?

933
01:14:16.403 --> 01:14:18.701
Oh, Elliot.

934
01:14:23.077 --> 01:14:25.136
You all right, Elliot?

935
01:14:26.647 --> 01:14:29.275
I'm a little lightheaded.

936
01:14:32.519 --> 01:14:35.818
Hey, Tiny. Nice show.

937
01:14:36.457 --> 01:14:39.324
- Behold, the mighty grizzly.
- Boog, Boog, Boog.

938
01:14:43.397 --> 01:14:44.762
- Let's get him!
- What? No!

939
01:14:46.066 --> 01:14:48.466
- Stay away! No!
- Here you go.

940
01:14:48.636 --> 01:14:51.036
Cannonball!

941
01:14:52.373 --> 01:14:54.807
You know, Elliot,
this place ain't so bad.

942
01:14:54.975 --> 01:14:56.567
Hold that thought. Oh, yeah.

943
01:14:56.744 --> 01:14:59.110
Karate noises!

944
01:15:12.292 --> 01:15:13.281
No.

945
01:15:18.232 --> 01:15:21.292
- Beth?
- Boog?

946
01:15:33.380 --> 01:15:34.608
Oh, Boog.

947
01:15:34.782 --> 01:15:36.875
- What's he doing?
- Is he not gonna maul her?

948
01:15:37.051 --> 01:15:40.782
No. She's his mom.
She's taking us home.

949
01:15:40.954 --> 01:15:42.649
Every buddy?

950
01:15:42.823 --> 01:15:46.919
I was so worried.
I'm bringing you back with me.

951
01:15:47.094 --> 01:15:49.119
Come on. Let's go home.

952
01:16:17.057 --> 01:16:19.389
Oh, no.

953
01:16:23.697 --> 01:16:25.995
Come on, Boog. Let's go home.

954
01:16:34.808 --> 01:16:36.332
Boog?

955
01:16:51.458 --> 01:16:53.016
You are home.

956
01:16:58.599 --> 01:17:00.829
I'm so proud of you.

957
01:17:02.569 --> 01:17:06.733
So how are we both
gonna fit in the helicopter?

958
01:17:06.907 --> 01:17:08.431
- She's coming back, right?
- Who?

959
01:17:08.609 --> 01:17:10.474
The shorts lady. Boog?

960
01:17:10.844 --> 01:17:12.675
- Hey, big guy.
- What's up, Tiny?

961
01:17:12.846 --> 01:17:14.177
- What's up?
- You said that we...

962
01:17:14.348 --> 01:17:15.975
- You're judging me?
- How y'all doing?

963
01:17:16.150 --> 01:17:17.310
- Hey, Boog.
- Hi, Boog.

964
01:17:17.484 --> 01:17:19.918
I know he's a duck.
But he treats me like a lady.

965
01:17:20.087 --> 01:17:21.315
- But she's...
- Hey, buddy.

966
01:17:21.488 --> 01:17:24.252
- Hey, find me some food.
- Come on. What is our pickup time?

967
01:17:24.424 --> 01:17:27.689
Elliot, we're staying here.
This is our home.

968
01:17:27.861 --> 01:17:31.024
These are our people.
This is where we reside.

969
01:17:31.198 --> 01:17:32.961
What? Are you insane?

970
01:17:33.133 --> 01:17:35.101
Where have you been
for the last two days?

971
01:17:35.269 --> 01:17:38.796
This place is horrible. Horrible!

972
01:17:38.972 --> 01:17:41.736
- Hey, guys.
- What's up, lan?

973
01:17:44.845 --> 01:17:46.710
Come on, Elliot. It ain't that bad.

974
01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:49.747
She's at least gonna bring
some Woo Hoo bars, right?

975
01:17:49.917 --> 01:17:51.646
It's just the two of us, Elliot.

976
01:17:51.819 --> 01:17:53.719
Unless you plan
on going back to your herd.

977
01:17:53.887 --> 01:17:56.788
What? And break up the team?
Bros before does.

978
01:17:56.957 --> 01:17:58.891
Yeah. Bros before does.

979
01:17:59.059 --> 01:18:01.186
Hello, Elliot.

980
01:18:01.361 --> 01:18:03.090
Catch you later, Boog.

981
01:18:09.403 --> 01:18:13.499
Hey! Get off my trees,
you bucktoothed sporran!

982
01:18:15.108 --> 01:18:17.599
Feels like home, baby.

983
01:18:17.778 --> 01:18:19.405
Hey, Boog!

984
01:18:20.314 --> 01:18:23.181
- Rabbit fight!
- Oh, no, you didn't.

985
01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:25.944
Oh, yeah? Well, eat rabbit.

986
01:18:26.787 --> 01:18:28.186
Hey, buddy.

987
01:18:54.114 --> 01:18:55.342
Bob! Bob!

988
01:19:02.422 --> 01:19:06.518
A real live homo-sasquatchus.

989
01:19:09.730 --> 01:19:14.064
Wait, wait. No. No. No!
