00:00:37.705 --> 00:00:41.541
<i>The global economy continues
to collapse as food prices spike.</i>

3
00:00:41.543 --> 00:00:44.710
<i>The world population has now
reached its eighth-billion mark.</i>

4
00:00:44.712 --> 00:00:46.444
<i>Food has
now replaced oil</i>

5
00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:48.179
<i>in becoming the most
prized commodity.</i>

6
00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:51.551
<i>California has now broken its
all-time record for the longest heatwave.</i>

7
00:00:51.553 --> 00:00:55.220
We now have more than eight
billion mouths to feed.

8
00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:58.323
<i>Even the slightest drop
in our world food supply</i>

9
00:00:58.325 --> 00:01:01.594
<i>can mean the total collapse
of our way of life.</i>

10
00:01:01.596 --> 00:01:05.363
<i>Indonesia promises to be
the leading food basket of the world,</i>

11
00:01:05.365 --> 00:01:07.833
<i>as Indra Siswadi,
the youngest elected President</i>

12
00:01:07.835 --> 00:01:09.234
<i>in the history
of the country...</i>

13
00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:10.101
No more hunger!

14
00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:11.871
<i>...declared his mission
in aiding</i>

15
00:01:11.873 --> 00:01:14.408
<i>the new World Hunger
Prevention Initiative.</i>

16
00:01:29.356 --> 00:01:33.325
<i>In times like these,
we can't help but ask,</i>

17
00:01:33.327 --> 00:01:35.763
<i>is this the beginning
of the end?</i>

18
00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:23.343
Hungry?

19
00:02:32.754 --> 00:02:33.821
Starving.

20
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:36.789
Wake up.

21
00:02:36.791 --> 00:02:39.491
You got that same squirm
the first time we met.

22
00:02:39.493 --> 00:02:41.927
I don't squirm.

23
00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:43.397
All right, maybe a little.

24
00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:48.400
It feels wrong letting you go
this time, I guess.

25
00:02:48.402 --> 00:02:50.468
Yo, Sari!

26
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.572
We got the one-on-one
with Indra. Let's go!

27
00:02:53.574 --> 00:02:56.676
As in the
Presidential-elect, Indra?

28
00:02:56.678 --> 00:02:58.911
He's gonna change
the world, you know.

29
00:02:58.913 --> 00:03:00.280
Save a lot of people.

30
00:03:00.948 --> 00:03:02.349
You should come.

31
00:03:03.918 --> 00:03:05.951
As soon as I get
myself straight.

32
00:03:05.953 --> 00:03:06.954
Listen...

33
00:03:09.657 --> 00:03:10.892
I got something for you.

34
00:03:14.595 --> 00:03:16.494
There's no stone yet,

35
00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:18.465
so, I guess it won't be
official until...

36
00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:20.968
But I will. I mean...

37
00:03:23.037 --> 00:03:24.570
As... As soon as...

38
00:03:24.572 --> 00:03:25.873
Shut the fuck up.

39
00:03:42.056 --> 00:03:44.458
Can a proposed girl
get a minute here?

40
00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:47.862
I'll take that as a yes?

41
00:03:53.034 --> 00:03:55.968
You'll have to ask for my
parents' blessings first, dummy.

42
00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.271
They'd kill you
if they found out about this.

43
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.373
Copy that.

44
00:04:06.346 --> 00:04:07.949
Ask me again
when I get back.

45
00:04:10.051 --> 00:04:12.385
And next time,
don't mumble.

46
00:04:23.931 --> 00:04:24.966
Yes, ma'am.

47
00:04:36.711 --> 00:04:37.712
<i>Wake up.</i>

48
00:04:44.417 --> 00:04:45.920
Morning, Mr. Congressman.

49
00:04:51.125 --> 00:04:52.627
Thank you for last night.

50
00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:00.535
<i>Good morning.</i>

51
00:05:01.401 --> 00:05:02.804
<i>It is 8:00 a.m.</i>

52
00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.778
<i>The future is now.</i>

53
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.381
<i>Puninar.
Your trusted solutions partner</i>

54
00:05:16.383 --> 00:05:18.085
<i>and the logistics
of the future.</i>

55
00:05:21.923 --> 00:05:23.991
Play on.

56
00:05:46.013 --> 00:05:47.646
All right.

57
00:05:47.648 --> 00:05:49.617
What is it this time?

58
00:06:46.207 --> 00:06:48.207
<i>PIRANAS delinquents,</i>

59
00:06:48.209 --> 00:06:50.945
<i>please stay behind the fence
and remain calm.</i>

60
00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:56.584
Hey! Hey!

61
00:06:57.084 --> 00:06:58.386
Hey!

62
00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.085
Hey!

63
00:07:00.087 --> 00:07:02.121
<i>Attention.</i>

64
00:07:02.123 --> 00:07:04.659
<i>Please stay behind the fence
and remain calm.</i>

65
00:07:06.994 --> 00:07:08.162
Get back inside!

66
00:07:12.934 --> 00:07:15.536
Mama.

67
00:07:16.737 --> 00:07:19.206
Mama!

68
00:07:21.809 --> 00:07:25.112
<i>Please proceed to the
filtering facility in an orderly manner.</i>

69
00:07:47.735 --> 00:07:49.635
<i>All citizens
must stand in line</i>

70
00:07:49.637 --> 00:07:51.706
<i>to secure your
weekly ration quota.</i>

71
00:07:56.143 --> 00:07:57.511
You a Marine girl?

72
00:07:58.779 --> 00:08:00.713
Sergeant Raya, sir.

73
00:08:00.715 --> 00:08:03.716
How'd you figure that, sir?

74
00:08:03.718 --> 00:08:07.186
Well, let's just say you and I
both know how to respect the quiet,

75
00:08:07.188 --> 00:08:09.021
unlike the Air Force.

76
00:08:09.023 --> 00:08:10.490
Yes, sir.

77
00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:38.784
<i>This is
Level One PIRANAS Military.</i>

78
00:08:38.786 --> 00:08:43.257
<i>All personnel must uncover their faces
and heads for facial identification.</i>

79
00:09:24.632 --> 00:09:26.932
Ah, Mr. Secretary.

80
00:09:26.934 --> 00:09:30.069
- How's it hanging, sir?
- Shriveled.

81
00:09:30.071 --> 00:09:33.872
Licked by many,
deformed by all the bullshit.

82
00:09:33.874 --> 00:09:35.176
But I digress.

83
00:09:36.043 --> 00:09:37.578
I regret I asked.

84
00:09:38.212 --> 00:09:39.745
Listen.

85
00:09:39.747 --> 00:09:42.381
It is a gross
understatement to say...

86
00:09:42.383 --> 00:09:45.619
that it's difficult for me
to get this kind of meeting.

87
00:09:47.088 --> 00:09:48.189
Yes, sir.

88
00:09:49.156 --> 00:09:50.324
Thank you, sir.

89
00:09:50.825 --> 00:09:53.894
Do not embarrass me.

90
00:10:05.406 --> 00:10:06.740
Mr. President.

91
00:10:07.308 --> 00:10:09.208
Congressman Angga.

92
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:10.811
The man I've been
telling you about.

93
00:10:11.679 --> 00:10:13.045
Mr. President.

94
00:10:13.047 --> 00:10:14.379
As you must already know,

95
00:10:14.381 --> 00:10:16.782
in the cowboy hat,
Mr. Hengky Laksono.

96
00:10:16.784 --> 00:10:19.384
Man in charge
of all things public media.

97
00:10:19.386 --> 00:10:22.089
More handsome in person
than on TV, I'm sure.

98
00:10:23.691 --> 00:10:25.390
General Adnan Atmadja,

99
00:10:25.392 --> 00:10:27.726
Commander of
the GERRAM Paramilitaries.

100
00:10:27.728 --> 00:10:30.062
And the head of
the PIRANAS Party himself,

101
00:10:30.064 --> 00:10:31.396
Mr. Farid Baskoro.

102
00:10:31.398 --> 00:10:33.899
It's a pleasure
to finally meet you, sir.

103
00:10:33.901 --> 00:10:37.638
I like to think of them as
the four pillars of PIRANAS.

104
00:10:38.739 --> 00:10:41.140
More like the four horsemen.

105
00:10:45.746 --> 00:10:48.113
Impressive job
on that Farmer's Bill.

106
00:10:48.115 --> 00:10:51.450
Looks like you wanna be
on the winner's team.

107
00:10:51.452 --> 00:10:53.018
Always, Mr. President.

108
00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:54.054
But...

109
00:10:54.688 --> 00:10:56.223
enough with the ass-kissing.

110
00:10:57.158 --> 00:10:58.292
Truth is, gentlemen...

111
00:10:59.894 --> 00:11:01.095
you suck at PR.

112
00:11:04.965 --> 00:11:07.001
- Angga.
- Let him speak.

113
00:11:10.337 --> 00:11:11.906
You see, our economy...

114
00:11:12.873 --> 00:11:14.108
well, it may be in the lead.

115
00:11:15.376 --> 00:11:17.278
But, the biggest threat...

116
00:11:18.445 --> 00:11:19.880
still lies within.

117
00:11:21.215 --> 00:11:23.117
Gentlemen, the people
are starving.

118
00:11:24.852 --> 00:11:26.987
Their nationalism, morale...

119
00:11:28.289 --> 00:11:29.390
dying.

120
00:11:30.991 --> 00:11:35.093
So, you're saying
we need to cut our profits

121
00:11:35.095 --> 00:11:36.929
and fight
world hunger bullshit?

122
00:11:36.931 --> 00:11:39.733
I'm saying, all they need...

123
00:11:40.535 --> 00:11:41.902
is a dream.

124
00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:45.839
Something that'll take
their minds off the hunger.

125
00:11:47.007 --> 00:11:49.210
A promise of a better future.

126
00:11:49.877 --> 00:11:51.278
A Heroic Act.

127
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.214
You see, gentlemen,

128
00:11:55.216 --> 00:11:57.216
The Reform,

129
00:11:57.218 --> 00:11:59.785
they're secretly gaining
massive followers.

130
00:11:59.787 --> 00:12:01.388
Promising more food for all.

131
00:12:02.557 --> 00:12:04.124
And whether
you like it or not,

132
00:12:05.826 --> 00:12:09.363
the people will side with anyone
who can offer them change.

133
00:12:10.231 --> 00:12:12.130
And these guys,

134
00:12:12.132 --> 00:12:15.501
they're saying exactly
what they want to hear.

135
00:12:15.503 --> 00:12:18.906
You're looking at a ticking
time bomb strapped to your ass.

136
00:12:20.441 --> 00:12:22.007
What are you proposing?

137
00:12:22.009 --> 00:12:23.177
We destroy their idea.

138
00:12:24.512 --> 00:12:26.878
Regains the people's trust.

139
00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.914
PIRANAS gets a new face-lift.

140
00:12:28.916 --> 00:12:30.918
Then, we can enjoy
our riches in peace.

141
00:12:32.587 --> 00:12:34.054
I volunteer for the lead.

142
00:12:34.922 --> 00:12:36.357
Black Ops. Off the books.

143
00:12:37.424 --> 00:12:38.459
And in return...

144
00:12:40.027 --> 00:12:42.429
I want 1%
of what PIRANAS makes.

145
00:12:43.531 --> 00:12:44.865
Every year...

146
00:12:45.833 --> 00:12:47.001
for the rest of its days.

147
00:12:48.302 --> 00:12:49.569
Holy shit.

148
00:13:04.351 --> 00:13:06.885
I hate it when you do that.

149
00:13:06.887 --> 00:13:08.420
Tell me I got it.

150
00:13:08.422 --> 00:13:11.189
Don't know how
you pulled that shit off.

151
00:13:11.191 --> 00:13:13.327
But... you got it, kid.

152
00:13:23.605 --> 00:13:24.838
What's this?

153
00:13:25.406 --> 00:13:26.706
The catch.

154
00:13:26.708 --> 00:13:29.810
They want you to lead the
operation with The Wolf himself.

155
00:13:30.377 --> 00:13:31.877
Wisnu.

156
00:13:31.879 --> 00:13:33.013
What?

157
00:13:33.981 --> 00:13:35.080
Get me back in there.

158
00:13:35.082 --> 00:13:36.150
You walk in there...

159
00:13:37.284 --> 00:13:40.085
we'll lose
this opportunity forever.

160
00:13:40.087 --> 00:13:44.423
I dislike the guy as much as you
do, you know that.

161
00:13:44.425 --> 00:13:47.294
But they trust his ass
more than yours.

162
00:13:49.597 --> 00:13:51.265
Do not screw this up.

163
00:14:52.527 --> 00:14:54.326
Finally,

164
00:14:54.328 --> 00:14:56.096
the four old men...

165
00:14:57.464 --> 00:15:00.065
have come to their senses.

166
00:15:00.067 --> 00:15:03.034
The hunger has turned us
against each other.

167
00:15:03.036 --> 00:15:06.340
No. It only shows you
who you really are.

168
00:15:07.241 --> 00:15:09.209
Guess we'll be working
together again.

169
00:15:15.149 --> 00:15:17.351
People are savages,
don't you think?

170
00:15:18.586 --> 00:15:21.689
We like to believe
we're better than animals.

171
00:15:22.322 --> 00:15:25.658
But the truth is, we kill.

172
00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:28.228
We feed off each other
just the same.

173
00:15:29.062 --> 00:15:30.164
Just the same.

174
00:15:32.166 --> 00:15:33.300
In this jungle,

175
00:15:34.268 --> 00:15:35.603
either you eat...

176
00:15:37.371 --> 00:15:38.606
or be eaten.

177
00:15:41.041 --> 00:15:42.109
Take a look.

178
00:15:44.378 --> 00:15:45.647
Prototype suit.

179
00:15:46.514 --> 00:15:47.649
Shipped this morning.

180
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:49.684
American.

181
00:15:55.523 --> 00:15:57.222
My God.

182
00:15:57.224 --> 00:15:59.191
An invisibility cloak?

183
00:15:59.193 --> 00:16:00.358
Yes.

184
00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.663
They call it "The Hide."

185
00:16:03.063 --> 00:16:06.231
Combine military-grade
LED Kevlar

186
00:16:06.233 --> 00:16:08.536
with nano cameras
within the seams.

187
00:16:11.338 --> 00:16:12.740
First, the UAVs,

188
00:16:13.608 --> 00:16:14.676
the Kodiaks,

189
00:16:15.577 --> 00:16:16.744
and now this.

190
00:16:19.279 --> 00:16:20.615
They're licking our asses clean.

191
00:16:22.817 --> 00:16:25.183
Speaking of tactics,

192
00:16:25.185 --> 00:16:28.188
your so-called Heroic Act is...

193
00:16:29.223 --> 00:16:31.559
no offense, idiotic.

194
00:16:33.126 --> 00:16:35.229
We are here
to preserve order,

195
00:16:35.797 --> 00:16:37.565
not practice democracy.

196
00:16:39.266 --> 00:16:41.034
Well, I'm not here
for your opinion.

197
00:16:42.537 --> 00:16:44.506
You're still the same mutt
I met years ago.

198
00:16:45.507 --> 00:16:46.608
And me?

199
00:16:48.442 --> 00:16:50.177
Still head of this operation.

200
00:16:51.613 --> 00:16:52.747
So, fall in.

201
00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:57.451
You know...

202
00:16:59.621 --> 00:17:02.089
I used to love
dressing up like Rambo.

203
00:17:04.191 --> 00:17:06.059
Thought I'd be
more respected.

204
00:17:07.529 --> 00:17:10.297
It taught me a very,
very valuable lesson.

205
00:17:12.466 --> 00:17:13.535
Oh, yeah?

206
00:17:14.468 --> 00:17:15.469
What's that?

207
00:17:16.738 --> 00:17:18.704
Fear!

208
00:17:18.706 --> 00:17:24.209
Unlike in the movies,
real people, primitives...

209
00:17:24.211 --> 00:17:29.082
have no respect for bravery,
or kindness, or heroes.

210
00:17:29.551 --> 00:17:31.084
Only fear.

211
00:17:31.786 --> 00:17:33.485
You wanna stop
your Reform?

212
00:17:33.487 --> 00:17:36.356
The only way
is to exterminate them.

213
00:17:39.192 --> 00:17:40.494
You've got company.

214
00:17:43.665 --> 00:17:45.731
All units, black quad drone!

215
00:17:45.733 --> 00:17:47.769
North side!
Don't let it get away!

216
00:17:57.745 --> 00:17:58.746
Go!

217
00:18:07.287 --> 00:18:08.688
Hey.

218
00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:09.757
Hey, you!

219
00:18:10.424 --> 00:18:11.458
Somebody...

220
00:18:19.199 --> 00:18:20.200
Shoot!

221
00:18:23.805 --> 00:18:24.806
Hey!

222
00:18:25.607 --> 00:18:26.608
Hey, stop!

223
00:18:27.742 --> 00:18:28.876
Hey, you. Stop!

224
00:18:36.216 --> 00:18:37.217
Bitch!

225
00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:41.353
Right there!

226
00:18:41.355 --> 00:18:42.523
Stop right there!

227
00:18:44.257 --> 00:18:45.893
Hands. I wanna see them now!

228
00:18:50.263 --> 00:18:51.365
Who do you work for?

229
00:18:52.934 --> 00:18:55.168
Turn around, slowly!

230
00:19:00.742 --> 00:19:02.677
The smart pad,
toss it over!

231
00:19:10.918 --> 00:19:12.618
Hey, do you hear me?

232
00:19:21.495 --> 00:19:23.798
I'm a government official,
on duty.

233
00:19:24.799 --> 00:19:26.433
People will be
looking for me.

234
00:20:13.848 --> 00:20:14.949
Stay back!

235
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:17.785
Weapons down, now!

236
00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:24.424
Stop!

237
00:20:36.938 --> 00:20:37.972
Sari?

238
00:20:39.006 --> 00:20:40.440
Lower your guns.

239
00:20:40.908 --> 00:20:42.275
I know this man.

240
00:20:44.478 --> 00:20:45.713
He's not one of 'em.

241
00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:57.890
I... I thought
you were dead.

242
00:20:57.892 --> 00:20:59.560
What does Wisnu
know about us?

243
00:21:01.796 --> 00:21:02.962
You joined the Reform?

244
00:21:02.964 --> 00:21:04.395
If you can't get me
what I need,

245
00:21:04.397 --> 00:21:05.800
- then you should leave.
- Sari, wait!

246
00:21:09.737 --> 00:21:11.469
Come with me.

247
00:21:11.471 --> 00:21:13.273
I've got everything
we've ever wanted.

248
00:21:15.543 --> 00:21:16.609
I can protect you...

249
00:21:16.611 --> 00:21:18.511
You helped incite
the Revolution.

250
00:21:18.513 --> 00:21:19.947
You really think
I didn't know that?

251
00:21:21.849 --> 00:21:24.617
I covered corruption stories
for breakfast, for God's sake.

252
00:21:24.619 --> 00:21:26.719
I did it for us!

253
00:21:26.721 --> 00:21:28.988
Don't you see
what this world has become?

254
00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:30.756
Hey, do you hear me?

255
00:21:30.758 --> 00:21:31.793
Mom.

256
00:21:36.463 --> 00:21:37.665
Pack your things, honey.

257
00:21:39.133 --> 00:21:40.802
We're leaving.

258
00:21:43.638 --> 00:21:44.739
I get it.

259
00:21:46.406 --> 00:21:48.341
And you're blaming me!

260
00:21:50.711 --> 00:21:51.846
She's yours.

261
00:21:55.448 --> 00:21:56.449
What?

262
00:22:00.955 --> 00:22:02.723
Since I found out
you were involved,

263
00:22:03.958 --> 00:22:05.392
Indra was being hunted...

264
00:22:06.961 --> 00:22:08.493
We went underground,

265
00:22:08.495 --> 00:22:10.497
spent years building
this Reform together.

266
00:22:13.868 --> 00:22:16.135
You founded the Reform?

267
00:22:16.137 --> 00:22:17.972
You've been fed
on lies, Angga.

268
00:22:23.544 --> 00:22:25.680
Then I just gave you
the death sentence.

269
00:22:31.886 --> 00:22:33.020
Get out!

270
00:22:34.589 --> 00:22:35.590
Now!

271
00:24:47.121 --> 00:24:49.088
Who's in charge?

272
00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:51.225
Where's the great
Reform's hideout?

273
00:24:59.333 --> 00:25:00.968
Guns! Guns!

274
00:25:40.341 --> 00:25:41.675
Clear!

275
00:25:45.946 --> 00:25:47.813
Alert the Party.

276
00:25:47.815 --> 00:25:50.584
The Congressman is now
an enemy of the state.

277
00:26:27.388 --> 00:26:30.758
Of all places,
abandoned shopping mall?

278
00:26:33.994 --> 00:26:35.096
We call it home.

279
00:26:37.665 --> 00:26:38.866
He's with us!

280
00:27:31.152 --> 00:27:32.820
Sari, Dinda, you all right?

281
00:27:35.756 --> 00:27:36.891
Spec.

282
00:27:38.192 --> 00:27:39.326
Where's everyone?

283
00:27:41.262 --> 00:27:42.263
We're it.

284
00:27:51.839 --> 00:27:52.905
Who's he?

285
00:27:52.907 --> 00:27:54.175
He helped us escape.

286
00:27:57.745 --> 00:27:58.913
He's clean.

287
00:28:01.148 --> 00:28:04.785
If I was a spy, this place
would've been burned to the ground.

288
00:28:15.362 --> 00:28:16.830
Sorry you had to be here.

289
00:28:19.266 --> 00:28:20.968
What are you
trying to achieve?

290
00:28:22.169 --> 00:28:24.171
You want your
presidency back, is that it?

291
00:28:27.007 --> 00:28:28.108
I used to.

292
00:28:29.977 --> 00:28:32.112
I fought so hard for what
this country would be...

293
00:28:33.013 --> 00:28:34.114
could be.

294
00:28:35.783 --> 00:28:36.951
Then, it all just...

295
00:28:38.385 --> 00:28:39.453
faded.

296
00:28:40.988 --> 00:28:43.088
The people,
they need to know

297
00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:45.025
what they're really
suffering for, Congressman.

298
00:28:45.527 --> 00:28:46.760
Greed.

299
00:28:47.294 --> 00:28:48.429
Corruption.

300
00:28:49.964 --> 00:28:52.264
That's why we're here.
Nothing more.

301
00:28:52.266 --> 00:28:53.767
Then what are you
waiting for?

302
00:28:54.802 --> 00:28:56.136
You've got your army with you.

303
00:28:56.837 --> 00:28:58.372
They seem equipped and ready.

304
00:28:59.507 --> 00:29:00.741
Walk with me.

305
00:29:05.412 --> 00:29:07.114
They were my voters.

306
00:29:07.982 --> 00:29:09.116
Believed in me.

307
00:29:10.818 --> 00:29:13.120
But now they're... here.

308
00:29:14.154 --> 00:29:15.256
But these people,

309
00:29:16.323 --> 00:29:17.958
and the one
that died today...

310
00:29:19.193 --> 00:29:20.294
volunteered.

311
00:29:21.295 --> 00:29:22.429
For me.

312
00:29:24.431 --> 00:29:25.897
You call them army.

313
00:29:25.899 --> 00:29:27.201
I call them family.

314
00:29:33.107 --> 00:29:35.407
If it wasn't for Spec,

315
00:29:35.409 --> 00:29:37.945
we would've never learned
to defend ourselves.

316
00:29:39.547 --> 00:29:40.914
Who is this Spec?

317
00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:44.885
Never knew his real name.

318
00:29:47.388 --> 00:29:49.056
Sari found him
on the streets.

319
00:29:50.157 --> 00:29:51.591
Saved him...

320
00:29:51.593 --> 00:29:53.325
just like she saved me.

321
00:29:53.327 --> 00:29:55.396
Then give me
that one phone call.

322
00:29:57.632 --> 00:30:00.434
I'll guarantee her safety
for the rest of her life.

323
00:30:08.008 --> 00:30:10.344
You have one minute
before they track us down.

324
00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:22.287
- Soeganda.
- Ganda, it's me. Listen.

325
00:30:22.289 --> 00:30:23.589
I don't have much time.

326
00:30:23.591 --> 00:30:26.158
Angga, what the hell happened?

327
00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:27.359
<i>They're accusing you
of helping</i>

328
00:30:27.361 --> 00:30:28.962
<i>the separatists,
for God's sake.</i>

329
00:30:29.897 --> 00:30:31.031
I've found her, Ganda.

330
00:30:31.999 --> 00:30:33.231
I've found Sari.

331
00:30:33.233 --> 00:30:34.132
<i>Kid, it's too late.</i>

332
00:30:34.134 --> 00:30:37.035
Your name is on
the GERRAM kill list.

333
00:30:37.037 --> 00:30:40.540
<i>Wisnu has taken your plan and
skewed it into one of his own.</i>

334
00:30:40.542 --> 00:30:44.409
And whatever it is,
it'll be carried out in three days.

335
00:30:44.411 --> 00:30:45.547
In three days?

336
00:30:46.246 --> 00:30:49.314
That's impossible.

337
00:30:49.316 --> 00:30:53.485
<i>Ganda, you've gotta help me stop
him, or I'll be dead.</i>

338
00:30:53.487 --> 00:30:56.254
Do you hear me?
Sari will be dead.

339
00:30:56.256 --> 00:30:57.257
Son...

340
00:30:59.493 --> 00:31:01.561
I love you like my own,

341
00:31:01.563 --> 00:31:03.897
but you cannot
win everything.

342
00:31:04.733 --> 00:31:06.967
<i>I'm sorry.
Good luck out there.</i>

343
00:31:16.678 --> 00:31:17.978
I wanna meet him.

344
00:31:21.348 --> 00:31:22.416
That takedown...

345
00:31:25.052 --> 00:31:26.220
straight-out military.

346
00:31:31.425 --> 00:31:33.528
Look, I'm putting together
an attack team.

347
00:31:37.431 --> 00:31:38.566
I want you in.

348
00:31:43.638 --> 00:31:44.905
I'm in.

349
00:31:53.581 --> 00:31:55.313
Let me
get this straight.

350
00:31:55.315 --> 00:31:57.685
- You want the five of us...
- Six.

351
00:31:59.153 --> 00:32:01.754
Pardon me, six.

352
00:32:01.756 --> 00:32:06.559
...to go after the adorable
Wisnu and his huggable thugs,

353
00:32:06.561 --> 00:32:09.930
to stop an unknown
PIRANAS conspiracy?

354
00:32:11.633 --> 00:32:13.666
Let's see, they have
a name for that.

355
00:32:13.668 --> 00:32:16.470
What is it? Oh, yeah,
it's treason!

356
00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.142
Are you fucking nuts?

357
00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:26.178
We'd... be dead.

358
00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:28.215
D-E-D. Dead!

359
00:32:31.018 --> 00:32:33.553
Besides, look at us.

360
00:32:33.555 --> 00:32:36.256
We've probably forgotten
half the things we used to do.

361
00:32:38.325 --> 00:32:41.028
And who the fuck
is this National Geographic?

362
00:32:44.566 --> 00:32:46.431
Innocent people's lives

363
00:32:46.433 --> 00:32:48.333
- are at stake here.
- Oh, bullshit, LT.

364
00:32:48.335 --> 00:32:51.071
Since when do you care, huh?

365
00:32:52.072 --> 00:32:54.339
Hey, maybe Wisnu is right.

366
00:32:54.341 --> 00:32:55.641
Maybe they are terrorists.

367
00:32:55.643 --> 00:32:57.175
Maybe they all
deserve to die.

368
00:32:57.177 --> 00:32:58.613
I found her, Ogs!

369
00:33:00.214 --> 00:33:01.215
Sari.

370
00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:05.553
And a little girl
that turns out to be mine.

371
00:33:10.224 --> 00:33:13.528
All of us,
we're at the top of the kill list.

372
00:33:19.701 --> 00:33:21.603
Is everything okay in here?

373
00:33:22.837 --> 00:33:24.604
I hope you don't mind

374
00:33:24.606 --> 00:33:27.341
- the powder tea.
- Ma! Will you just get out?

375
00:33:30.344 --> 00:33:31.779
Just trying to help.

376
00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:37.084
Look...

377
00:33:37.719 --> 00:33:39.119
I feel you.

378
00:33:41.255 --> 00:33:45.459
And PIRANAS, man, I'd shove it up
their bumhole any day of the week.

379
00:33:46.694 --> 00:33:48.061
But I can't.

380
00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:50.130
I...

381
00:33:51.164 --> 00:33:52.567
I just can't.

382
00:33:57.572 --> 00:33:59.273
Then we'll show
ourselves out.

383
00:34:01.441 --> 00:34:02.810
It was nice
seeing you again, Ogs.

384
00:34:26.266 --> 00:34:28.068
You must be
so disappointed in me.

385
00:34:31.806 --> 00:34:33.673
Son,

386
00:34:33.675 --> 00:34:35.810
you've always chosen
your own path.

387
00:34:37.177 --> 00:34:38.680
And you've always
pulled through.

388
00:34:40.247 --> 00:34:41.481
Disappointed?

389
00:34:44.519 --> 00:34:47.220
You're just waiting for an
opportunity to impress...

390
00:34:49.222 --> 00:34:53.427
not just me,
but the whole world.

391
00:35:01.536 --> 00:35:02.637
LT!

392
00:35:05.907 --> 00:35:07.441
Could use the exercise.

393
00:35:08.743 --> 00:35:09.809
Come on!

394
00:35:09.811 --> 00:35:11.512
I'll show you
where the guys are.

395
00:35:29.897 --> 00:35:31.231
Which one is he?

396
00:35:32.066 --> 00:35:33.768
The one with his face
on the floor.

397
00:36:38.298 --> 00:36:41.334
Look, it's good
to see you guys and all,

398
00:36:42.269 --> 00:36:43.403
but...

399
00:36:44.404 --> 00:36:46.406
really not into reunions.

400
00:36:47.542 --> 00:36:49.443
Isn't that oil
all over you?

401
00:36:52.914 --> 00:36:54.247
So?

402
00:36:55.482 --> 00:36:56.716
No reason.

403
00:36:56.718 --> 00:36:58.285
Listen, Bara...

404
00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:05.457
- We got a job for you.
- Yeah.

405
00:37:05.459 --> 00:37:08.495
It's one of those
won't-make-it-out-alive kind.

406
00:37:10.932 --> 00:37:12.934
So it's a suicide mission?

407
00:37:17.538 --> 00:37:18.639
When do we start?

408
00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:24.645
What's in it for me?

409
00:37:27.048 --> 00:37:29.481
I told you the amount.

410
00:37:29.483 --> 00:37:30.850
You'd be worry-free
for the next decade.

411
00:37:30.852 --> 00:37:34.419
Oh, stop. We all know
how it is.

412
00:37:34.421 --> 00:37:36.321
Last cash lasted us,
what, huh,

413
00:37:36.323 --> 00:37:38.090
four, five years tops?

414
00:37:38.092 --> 00:37:39.892
Why do you think
they demoted me?

415
00:37:39.894 --> 00:37:42.528
Bullshit graveyard-shift,
checking every damn door

416
00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:44.697
in the PIRANAS Tower
before they finally fired me?

417
00:37:44.699 --> 00:37:46.364
Oh, come on, Tino.

418
00:37:46.366 --> 00:37:49.635
Where was our beloved LT
when the Corp kicked us out?

419
00:37:49.637 --> 00:37:52.772
He got that shiny brand-new
job passing dirty bills.

420
00:37:52.774 --> 00:37:55.574
With taxpayers' money.
Our money.

421
00:37:55.576 --> 00:37:57.375
All right, leave us.

422
00:37:57.377 --> 00:37:58.445
But...

423
00:38:11.793 --> 00:38:12.994
What do you want, Tino?

424
00:38:13.795 --> 00:38:14.862
Finally.

425
00:38:16.429 --> 00:38:17.865
You might've fooled the herd,

426
00:38:19.466 --> 00:38:20.601
not me.

427
00:38:23.938 --> 00:38:25.706
I want what you have.

428
00:38:38.553 --> 00:38:40.786
You think a fancy watch
will change my mind?

429
00:38:40.788 --> 00:38:42.788
Plus a quarter...

430
00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:45.660
of everything in my stash.

431
00:38:46.694 --> 00:38:47.795
Now, are you in...

432
00:38:48.863 --> 00:38:50.031
or out?

433
00:38:58.139 --> 00:38:59.439
Yeah.

434
00:39:00.641 --> 00:39:01.807
LT!

435
00:39:01.809 --> 00:39:04.043
Actually, I was
in the middle of my vlog.

436
00:39:04.045 --> 00:39:06.446
Um, so if you don't mind...

437
00:39:14.856 --> 00:39:16.557
- I gotta get outta here.
- Just...

438
00:39:18.826 --> 00:39:21.426
- Yo, freckle dick.
- Yo.

439
00:39:23.831 --> 00:39:25.099
- You son of a...
- Hey!

440
00:39:26.634 --> 00:39:28.634
Guys, guys, guys, stop!

441
00:39:28.636 --> 00:39:30.071
Hey, hey. Hey!

442
00:39:35.142 --> 00:39:37.111
Ethan, I need the best tech.

443
00:39:38.012 --> 00:39:39.144
I need you to find some

444
00:39:39.146 --> 00:39:42.850
very classified information
on the PIRANAS VIP server.

445
00:39:44.085 --> 00:39:46.785
The PIRANAS server?

446
00:39:46.787 --> 00:39:48.453
You gotta be shitting me.

447
00:39:48.455 --> 00:39:50.222
Look.

448
00:39:50.224 --> 00:39:52.560
We're not supposed
to tell you this, kid, but...

449
00:39:53.194 --> 00:39:56.631
It's a top-secret...

450
00:39:57.497 --> 00:39:59.033
recruitment test.

451
00:40:00.935 --> 00:40:02.234
What?

452
00:40:02.236 --> 00:40:04.171
Only a lucky few
get selected.

453
00:40:05.072 --> 00:40:07.172
You pass this one,

454
00:40:07.174 --> 00:40:08.974
all eyes will be on you, kid.

455
00:40:08.976 --> 00:40:10.709
You'd be famous.

456
00:40:10.711 --> 00:40:12.680
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait.

457
00:40:14.148 --> 00:40:15.214
Uh...

458
00:40:15.216 --> 00:40:16.550
Acting gigs,

459
00:40:17.184 --> 00:40:18.552
red carpet famous?

460
00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:20.621
Sky's the limit.

461
00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:24.123
All right.

462
00:40:24.125 --> 00:40:25.458
Here goes nothing.

463
00:40:47.915 --> 00:40:49.515
Move! Move!

464
00:40:49.517 --> 00:40:51.786
Stand back! Get out!
Get out of my face.

465
00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:54.119
- Get back!
- Heads up.

466
00:40:54.121 --> 00:40:55.423
We've got company.

467
00:40:56.057 --> 00:40:57.222
They tracked us.

468
00:40:57.224 --> 00:40:58.524
Shit!

469
00:40:58.526 --> 00:40:59.758
- We've gotta get outta here.
- Wait.

470
00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:01.927
- Who's "they"?
- How much more time?

471
00:41:01.929 --> 00:41:03.764
- This isn't a test, is it?
- How much?

472
00:41:12.073 --> 00:41:13.174
Come on, come on,
come on!

473
00:41:15.977 --> 00:41:17.111
Move! Move!

474
00:41:21.682 --> 00:41:23.751
Done. I'm done. Holy shit!

475
00:41:31.158 --> 00:41:32.992
This can't be right, can it?

476
00:41:32.994 --> 00:41:34.795
Tomorrow's date.
Click on that.

477
00:41:37.631 --> 00:41:38.998
What is this?

478
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.266
Nothing but PIRANAS
Senators' profiles.

479
00:41:41.268 --> 00:41:42.269
No.

480
00:41:42.737 --> 00:41:44.737
These are targets.

481
00:41:44.739 --> 00:41:48.207
Sacrificing their own Senators,
scapegoating the Reform.

482
00:41:48.209 --> 00:41:50.209
Wolves in sheep's clothing.

483
00:41:50.211 --> 00:41:52.311
It's a false-flag attack.

484
00:41:52.313 --> 00:41:54.947
There'll be murders
and riots.

485
00:41:54.949 --> 00:41:57.051
Give something for the people
to be angry about.

486
00:41:59.653 --> 00:42:01.789
A government-sanctioned
genocide.

487
00:42:16.837 --> 00:42:18.370
- Left, clear.
- Right, clear!

488
00:42:18.372 --> 00:42:19.707
All clear!

489
00:42:33.621 --> 00:42:34.922
Get the cavalry.

490
00:43:44.792 --> 00:43:46.060
Electrical manual?

491
00:43:48.195 --> 00:43:50.731
Hey, do you know when
your mother and I first met?

492
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.269
We were instantly drawn
to each other.

493
00:43:57.171 --> 00:43:59.240
You know, like electricity.

494
00:44:00.374 --> 00:44:01.775
She used to say,

495
00:44:03.010 --> 00:44:04.443
"If you come any nearer,

496
00:44:04.445 --> 00:44:07.047
"I'll tase you in the face."

497
00:44:11.418 --> 00:44:13.819
Anyway...

498
00:44:13.821 --> 00:44:15.890
Thought I'd make up
for the lost time.

499
00:44:23.764 --> 00:44:26.298
I found it
in the old bookstore.

500
00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:28.836
A free fox pin included
in the back page, too.

501
00:44:30.304 --> 00:44:32.239
Look, I know
I wasn't there for you...

502
00:44:38.412 --> 00:44:39.713
Wake up.

503
00:44:44.451 --> 00:44:45.986
A children's fable?

504
00:44:47.121 --> 00:44:48.822
She's 12, not five.

505
00:44:50.491 --> 00:44:51.992
She's stubborn.

506
00:44:54.795 --> 00:44:56.363
Wonder where she got it from.

507
00:44:59.867 --> 00:45:00.935
You know...

508
00:45:03.971 --> 00:45:06.907
I never really had the chance
to say thank you, for...

509
00:45:07.775 --> 00:45:09.176
what you and the boys did.

510
00:45:11.245 --> 00:45:12.413
So, thank you.

511
00:45:20.955 --> 00:45:23.824
Is it a good time
to meet your parents now?

512
00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:29.061
Oh, you'll never get a chance
to see them now, slick.

513
00:45:29.063 --> 00:45:31.265
You're the bastard
who knocked me up and left me.

514
00:45:34.201 --> 00:45:35.336
Never again.

515
00:45:37.071 --> 00:45:38.270
What?

516
00:45:38.272 --> 00:45:39.406
Don't mumble.

517
00:45:41.075 --> 00:45:42.743
I'll never leave you again.

518
00:45:49.850 --> 00:45:51.018
Maybe it's too late.

519
00:45:53.053 --> 00:45:54.922
I heard about
the attack plan tomorrow.

520
00:45:57.057 --> 00:45:58.759
There's no turning back
from that.

521
00:46:05.099 --> 00:46:06.133
Hey, guys.

522
00:46:06.767 --> 00:46:08.202
Let's get up on the double.

523
00:46:09.036 --> 00:46:10.104
Moving out.

524
00:46:13.575 --> 00:46:16.944
Tino, you're one of
the smartest people I know.

525
00:46:17.978 --> 00:46:20.281
You're gonna start telling me
it's impossible?

526
00:46:26.153 --> 00:46:27.788
Fucking hell.

527
00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:31.191
We'll think simple.

528
00:46:33.561 --> 00:46:35.062
Subtract.

529
00:47:14.602 --> 00:47:15.936
What is this?

530
00:47:23.143 --> 00:47:24.445
For the Reform!

531
00:47:47.167 --> 00:47:48.367
- Ganda!
- Angga!

532
00:47:50.003 --> 00:47:51.238
No time to explain.
Let's go!

533
00:47:53.273 --> 00:47:55.440
Move, move!
Move, move!

534
00:47:55.442 --> 00:47:56.578
Go, go, go!

535
00:47:58.513 --> 00:48:00.479
Go, go, go. Go, go!
Move, move, move.

536
00:48:00.481 --> 00:48:01.549
Get in the car!

537
00:48:03.951 --> 00:48:05.984
Stick to the plan.
I'll tell you where to go.

538
00:48:05.986 --> 00:48:07.054
Copy that.

539
00:48:08.188 --> 00:48:09.591
- Smoke 'em out!
- Smoke 'em out!

540
00:48:13.561 --> 00:48:15.093
Let's go!

541
00:48:15.095 --> 00:48:17.597
Package is secured!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

542
00:48:17.599 --> 00:48:19.131
I'm on it. You go.

543
00:48:19.133 --> 00:48:20.167
Spec, no!

544
00:48:33.581 --> 00:48:35.683
Holy shit!
We've got Kodiaks.

545
00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:41.219
We gotta get out of here!

546
00:48:41.221 --> 00:48:43.190
Go, go, go!
Get in!

547
00:48:44.291 --> 00:48:45.426
Let's go! Let's go!

548
00:49:23.698 --> 00:49:25.765
No. Sari!

549
00:49:25.767 --> 00:49:27.132
No!

550
00:49:45.252 --> 00:49:47.120
Wasn't easy or cheap!

551
00:49:48.556 --> 00:49:50.692
But whatever you manage
to destroy...

552
00:49:54.094 --> 00:49:55.160
we fix.

553
00:49:55.162 --> 00:49:57.730
Oh, my God.

554
00:49:57.732 --> 00:50:00.668
Spent a lifetime searching
for this filthy rabbit hole.

555
00:50:02.269 --> 00:50:03.671
But now that I'm here...

556
00:50:06.473 --> 00:50:08.340
it feels like home.

557
00:50:08.342 --> 00:50:09.441
What did you do to her?

558
00:50:09.443 --> 00:50:12.110
No, put that away.

559
00:50:12.112 --> 00:50:14.782
She's just pretty beat up from
putting up a mean fight, is all.

560
00:50:15.683 --> 00:50:17.184
Killed three of my men.

561
00:50:20.287 --> 00:50:24.222
Why don't you tell your men
to drop their antique toys...

562
00:50:24.224 --> 00:50:26.360
before I put a hole in her face.

563
00:50:35.837 --> 00:50:37.137
Roll, please!

564
00:50:54.822 --> 00:50:57.355
Long live the Reform.

565
00:51:11.806 --> 00:51:13.173
No!

566
00:51:21.281 --> 00:51:22.915
And that's it!

567
00:51:22.917 --> 00:51:24.117
Quick,

568
00:51:24.619 --> 00:51:27.154
simple, graphic.

569
00:51:27.789 --> 00:51:29.389
Just how the people want it.

570
00:51:35.329 --> 00:51:37.295
You fuck!

571
00:51:37.297 --> 00:51:39.834
Well, I got a surprise
for you.

572
00:51:48.442 --> 00:51:50.509
Congressman!
Congressman, here!

573
00:51:50.511 --> 00:51:52.243
Dinda!

574
00:51:52.245 --> 00:51:53.613
Dinda, you all right?

575
00:51:53.615 --> 00:51:55.748
Mama!

576
00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:58.651
Dinda! Mommy's okay, baby.
Mama's all right.

577
00:51:58.653 --> 00:52:00.287
Look, you win, all right?

578
00:52:01.488 --> 00:52:03.488
The Reform is finished!

579
00:52:03.490 --> 00:52:05.691
What else do you
want from me?

580
00:52:05.693 --> 00:52:07.827
You like making deals, right?

581
00:52:07.829 --> 00:52:09.196
So here's one for you.

582
00:52:19.373 --> 00:52:20.608
You see this remote?

583
00:52:21.042 --> 00:52:22.775
Say, "I see it."

584
00:52:22.777 --> 00:52:24.510
- I see it!
- Good.

585
00:52:24.512 --> 00:52:27.682
It triggers the bomb I planted
on the elevator's cable.

586
00:52:29.984 --> 00:52:31.284
Set it to...

587
00:52:32.386 --> 00:52:33.588
one minute.

588
00:52:36.490 --> 00:52:40.559
So you gotta choose
how you spend that minute.

589
00:52:40.561 --> 00:52:43.529
Save your woman,
or your kid.

590
00:52:43.531 --> 00:52:44.830
But if I were you,

591
00:52:44.832 --> 00:52:47.300
I'd use it to haul
my own ass out of here.

592
00:52:53.775 --> 00:52:57.510
You've shown what you would
do for the ones you love.

593
00:52:57.512 --> 00:52:59.246
Now show them
who you really are.

594
00:53:05.285 --> 00:53:06.353
Hey, you.

595
00:53:08.656 --> 00:53:10.457
You will die in pieces.

596
00:53:15.262 --> 00:53:16.263
Let him be.

597
00:53:16.864 --> 00:53:18.331
And kill the others.

598
00:53:22.970 --> 00:53:24.402
Move!

599
00:54:56.564 --> 00:54:57.630
Hold on, honey!

600
00:55:03.805 --> 00:55:05.104
Hey, Dinda.

601
00:55:05.106 --> 00:55:06.906
What are you doing?

602
00:55:20.721 --> 00:55:22.623
What are you doing?
She's in there!

603
00:55:23.558 --> 00:55:25.124
Get off me!

604
00:55:25.126 --> 00:55:27.394
Stop! Stop...
Will you stop it?

605
00:55:38.906 --> 00:55:40.440
No!

606
00:55:55.823 --> 00:55:58.724
You killed my daughter,
you monster!

607
00:55:58.726 --> 00:56:00.094
Get off of me!

608
00:56:07.902 --> 00:56:09.036
Hold on!

609
00:56:18.445 --> 00:56:20.880
- The emergency brakes.
- Mama!

610
00:56:20.882 --> 00:56:22.516
- We're okay!
- Do you hear that?

611
00:56:23.618 --> 00:56:24.917
Dinda's fine.

612
00:56:24.919 --> 00:56:27.119
I'm gonna get you up.

613
00:56:27.121 --> 00:56:29.757
Don't you give up...
Ah, shit!

614
00:56:40.467 --> 00:56:42.469
Angga! Listen to me!

615
00:56:43.537 --> 00:56:44.839
You take care of her.

616
00:56:46.207 --> 00:56:47.474
Tell her...

617
00:56:48.776 --> 00:56:50.811
be brave for the new world
to come.

618
00:56:51.545 --> 00:56:52.780
Sari, please.

619
00:56:54.015 --> 00:56:55.816
I can't lose you again.

620
00:56:59.887 --> 00:57:00.888
Wake up.

621
00:57:01.756 --> 00:57:02.790
You never did.

622
00:57:44.665 --> 00:57:45.666
Papa!

623
00:57:46.233 --> 00:57:47.299
I'm here!

624
00:57:47.301 --> 00:57:48.970
Listen to my voice, Papa!

625
00:58:03.217 --> 00:58:04.518
Papa!

626
00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:07.188
Over here!

627
00:58:08.589 --> 00:58:10.191
Just follow my voice!

628
00:58:12.994 --> 00:58:14.095
Papa!

629
00:58:15.563 --> 00:58:18.764
Dinda, honey. I can't.

630
00:58:18.766 --> 00:58:20.101
I don't know what to do.

631
00:58:21.235 --> 00:58:23.769
Listen. We're gonna be okay.

632
00:58:23.771 --> 00:58:25.639
Get to the emergency
staircase!

633
00:58:26.374 --> 00:58:28.109
We need you
to pull us out.

634
00:58:29.110 --> 00:58:31.512
Come on! Focus!

635
00:58:34.315 --> 00:58:35.948
Hold on.

636
00:58:48.996 --> 00:58:50.362
Papa!

637
00:58:50.364 --> 00:58:52.066
- Dinda!
- We're back here!

638
00:59:00.174 --> 00:59:01.242
Angga!

639
00:59:09.750 --> 00:59:10.851
I'll get us help!

640
00:59:41.949 --> 00:59:43.117
What are you
waiting for?

641
00:59:58.866 --> 00:59:59.867
Pull!

642
01:00:01.068 --> 01:00:02.069
Hold on!

643
01:00:21.956 --> 01:00:23.057
Sergeant.

644
01:00:25.292 --> 01:00:26.792
They know everything.

645
01:00:26.794 --> 01:00:28.796
Never a big fan
of PIRANAS anyway, sir.

646
01:00:29.396 --> 01:00:30.731
We're here to help.

647
01:00:32.333 --> 01:00:33.634
Who told you?

648
01:00:48.249 --> 01:00:50.716
<i>It has been
eight excruciating hours</i>

649
01:00:50.718 --> 01:00:53.886
<i>since the capital kidnapping
incident this morning.</i>

650
01:00:53.888 --> 01:00:56.788
<i>Seven senators have
been held hostage so far,</i>

651
01:00:56.790 --> 01:00:59.360
<i>with no signs of demand
by the Reform separatists.</i>

652
01:01:01.195 --> 01:01:04.229
<i>That is, until recently,
when an anonymous video</i>

653
01:01:04.231 --> 01:01:06.200
<i>was made public
for the world to see.</i>

654
01:01:07.902 --> 01:01:09.268
<i>Warning.</i>

655
01:01:09.270 --> 01:01:13.240
<i>What you are about to see is
graphic and may disturb you.</i>

656
01:01:25.419 --> 01:01:27.319
Who are we
kidding, huh?

657
01:01:27.321 --> 01:01:30.291
How could six has-beens stop
the government in three days?

658
01:01:31.825 --> 01:01:33.227
We were fucked
from the start.

659
01:01:36.764 --> 01:01:37.765
What are you doing?

660
01:01:41.402 --> 01:01:43.001
Leaving.

661
01:01:43.003 --> 01:01:45.204
Job's done, remember?

662
01:01:45.206 --> 01:01:48.307
Our mugs are registered on the
top of the wanted list, Tino.

663
01:01:48.309 --> 01:01:49.908
No shit.

664
01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:51.478
If we stay here,
we're dead.

665
01:01:55.282 --> 01:01:56.717
Where do you think
you're going?

666
01:01:57.519 --> 01:01:59.284
The PIRANAS Tower.

667
01:01:59.286 --> 01:02:00.287
Why?

668
01:02:00.988 --> 01:02:01.989
How?

669
01:02:03.424 --> 01:02:05.224
- Never mind.
- Tino.

670
01:02:05.226 --> 01:02:07.326
No, no, no,
it's fucking brilliant.

671
01:02:07.328 --> 01:02:10.896
Even if we do manage
to get inside the gates...

672
01:02:10.898 --> 01:02:13.465
The Tower's
like a maze.

673
01:02:13.467 --> 01:02:16.368
We can't make it to the second
floor, let alone the VIP chamber.

674
01:02:16.370 --> 01:02:18.170
Yeah, but you can.

675
01:02:18.172 --> 01:02:21.006
You said it yourself,
you used to work graveyard there.

676
01:02:21.008 --> 01:02:23.976
You know its every
floor plan, inside and out.

677
01:02:23.978 --> 01:02:27.446
Maybe you've forgotten,
but they just butchered us out there!

678
01:02:27.448 --> 01:02:29.881
Including his
precious girlfriend!

679
01:02:29.883 --> 01:02:32.317
I'm going back.
I'm going back.

680
01:02:32.319 --> 01:02:34.321
I am going back!

681
01:02:43.097 --> 01:02:44.198
I'm going back.

682
01:02:54.275 --> 01:02:56.108
Un-fucking-believable.

683
01:02:56.110 --> 01:02:58.310
You two deserve
each other!

684
01:02:58.312 --> 01:03:00.245
Sir, couldn't help
but hearing.

685
01:03:00.247 --> 01:03:02.114
The presidential address
is only hours away.

686
01:03:02.116 --> 01:03:03.315
Even if you were
able to stop them,

687
01:03:03.317 --> 01:03:05.286
you won't make it
there in time. Sir.

688
01:03:12.459 --> 01:03:14.061
Not by driving,
anyway, sir.

689
01:03:14.763 --> 01:03:16.529
I'll tell them
you hijacked it.

690
01:03:16.531 --> 01:03:18.531
Thank you, Sergeant.

691
01:03:18.533 --> 01:03:20.566
I'm afraid we can't
join your fight, sir.

692
01:03:20.568 --> 01:03:22.903
- We're still under constant...
- I'm not asking you to.

693
01:03:25.272 --> 01:03:27.207
Help as many people out there
as you can, Sergeant.

694
01:03:29.410 --> 01:03:31.076
Oh, and sir...

695
01:03:31.078 --> 01:03:32.547
I think this
belongs to you.

696
01:03:34.181 --> 01:03:35.914
They were tearing
your place apart,

697
01:03:35.916 --> 01:03:37.818
so I kind of stole it.

698
01:03:43.157 --> 01:03:44.325
Good luck out there, sir.

699
01:04:18.058 --> 01:04:19.126
If, uh...

700
01:04:20.595 --> 01:04:22.394
- If I don't come back...
- You will.

701
01:04:22.396 --> 01:04:23.464
So, shut up.

702
01:04:26.066 --> 01:04:27.301
You're just like
your mother.

703
01:04:28.503 --> 01:04:29.604
Go get them, Pa.

704
01:04:33.273 --> 01:04:34.674
Ready engine one.

705
01:04:34.676 --> 01:04:36.341
Ready engine two.

706
01:04:36.343 --> 01:04:38.477
Clear skies.
Ready for take-off.

707
01:04:38.479 --> 01:04:40.147
Hold on.
Someone's coming.

708
01:05:40.073 --> 01:05:42.274
Two minutes!

709
01:05:44.077 --> 01:05:45.078
Gather up.

710
01:05:46.514 --> 01:05:49.247
We got a one-hour window
before the cavalry comes in.

711
01:05:49.249 --> 01:05:50.482
Maybe less.

712
01:05:50.484 --> 01:05:53.621
Remember, you only need one
confession to stop all this.

713
01:05:56.089 --> 01:05:57.090
Tino?

714
01:06:02.129 --> 01:06:05.798
Our best point of entry
is the holding area, here.

715
01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:09.167
But in order to get there, we have to
circle around the construction sites, here,

716
01:06:09.169 --> 01:06:11.036
and the trucking hold, here.

717
01:06:11.038 --> 01:06:13.438
It's our best bet in making
it to the Tower alive.

718
01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:14.676
We'll split into four teams.

719
01:06:15.810 --> 01:06:17.309
Ethan, you're the key.

720
01:06:17.311 --> 01:06:18.611
Go to the main
control room.

721
01:06:18.613 --> 01:06:19.879
Override the system.

722
01:06:19.881 --> 01:06:23.348
Lock down their security gates,
doors, and helipad access.

723
01:06:23.350 --> 01:06:26.084
You open only the ones leading
up to the VIP chambers.

724
01:06:26.086 --> 01:06:28.688
- You got all that?
- Any backup, sir?

725
01:06:28.690 --> 01:06:30.123
You're on your own
this time, kid.

726
01:06:31.158 --> 01:06:32.159
Yes, sir.

727
01:06:32.727 --> 01:06:33.728
Oggi, Tino...

728
01:06:35.195 --> 01:06:36.598
you guys are in charge
of the explosives.

729
01:06:37.297 --> 01:06:38.664
Spec?

730
01:06:38.666 --> 01:06:40.033
South watch tower.

731
01:06:40.735 --> 01:06:42.202
360 kill zone.

732
01:06:43.103 --> 01:06:44.704
Bara, you stay with me.

733
01:06:44.706 --> 01:06:46.373
Millions of lives
are at stake tonight.

734
01:06:47.474 --> 01:06:48.475
They're counting on us.

735
01:06:49.309 --> 01:06:50.643
And me...

736
01:06:50.645 --> 01:06:52.012
I'm counting on you.

737
01:07:14.134 --> 01:07:15.367
Go, go, go, go!

738
01:07:15.369 --> 01:07:16.504
Go, go! Go!

739
01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:54.540
<i>Attention.</i>

740
01:07:54.542 --> 01:07:56.678
<i>The state of martial law
has been issued.</i>

741
01:08:20.501 --> 01:08:21.502
<i>In position.</i>

742
01:08:27.508 --> 01:08:28.574
<i>Clear.</i>

743
01:08:35.215 --> 01:08:37.518
Three, two, one.
Execute.

744
01:09:03.310 --> 01:09:04.512
Target neutralized.

745
01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:06.781
Left, clear.

746
01:09:07.615 --> 01:09:08.681
Right, clear.

747
01:09:08.683 --> 01:09:09.684
All clear.

748
01:09:10.350 --> 01:09:11.984
Hold for visual.

749
01:09:11.986 --> 01:09:15.623
We got a confirmed,
VIP vehicle exiting compound.

750
01:09:16.456 --> 01:09:17.592
Positive ID.

751
01:09:18.026 --> 01:09:19.558
Farid Baskoro.

752
01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:21.527
- Shit!
- Let him go.

753
01:09:21.529 --> 01:09:23.698
Remember, we only need one
of the PIRANAS Four anyway.

754
01:09:24.132 --> 01:09:25.332
Let's do this.

755
01:09:30.571 --> 01:09:33.639
<i>The
national curfew is in effect.</i>

756
01:09:33.641 --> 01:09:35.240
It is chaos here
in the city,

757
01:09:35.242 --> 01:09:37.510
<i>as the nation
is on lockdown,</i>

758
01:09:37.512 --> 01:09:42.515
<i>the borders closed and a curfew
issued, due to the nationwide manhunt.</i>

759
01:09:42.517 --> 01:09:44.719
<i>All citizens must
remain indoors until...</i>

760
01:10:00.702 --> 01:10:02.400
You two, hands up!

761
01:10:02.402 --> 01:10:03.571
Now! Get...

762
01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:07.240
Shit.

763
01:10:58.492 --> 01:10:59.761
I can't believe
I'm doing this.

764
01:11:10.738 --> 01:11:12.505
Get the strike squad.

765
01:11:12.507 --> 01:11:13.608
Check the control room.

766
01:11:29.123 --> 01:11:30.323
Last one up.

767
01:11:31.025 --> 01:11:32.325
Hope they all work.

768
01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:44.036
RV's clear.

769
01:11:44.038 --> 01:11:46.739
Ethan, strike squad
is en route.

770
01:11:46.741 --> 01:11:49.108
Main exits compromised.

771
01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:51.344
Ethan, get the hell out
of there now.

772
01:11:51.946 --> 01:11:53.948
Wait. I need more time.

773
01:12:03.423 --> 01:12:04.924
Ethan, do you hear me?

774
01:12:04.926 --> 01:12:06.491
Get out, now!

775
01:12:06.493 --> 01:12:07.494
Move!

776
01:12:26.981 --> 01:12:28.581
Shit, he's compromised.

777
01:12:28.583 --> 01:12:29.949
They're gonna be here
any second.

778
01:12:29.951 --> 01:12:31.018
Kid, if you hear me...

779
01:12:32.452 --> 01:12:33.486
we have to go.

780
01:12:34.755 --> 01:12:35.823
I'm sorry.

781
01:12:37.124 --> 01:12:38.524
Do it.

782
01:12:43.531 --> 01:12:44.799
Sons of bitches!

783
01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.600
No!

784
01:12:47.602 --> 01:12:48.667
It's a distraction.

785
01:12:48.669 --> 01:12:49.802
<i>Security breach.</i>

786
01:12:49.804 --> 01:12:51.639
They're here
for the VIPs.

787
01:12:52.607 --> 01:12:54.041
Go to the construction site.

788
01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:55.710
You stop them.

789
01:12:56.611 --> 01:12:57.745
You heard him!

790
01:12:58.179 --> 01:12:59.477
Let's move out!

791
01:13:34.481 --> 01:13:35.482
I'll hold them off.

792
01:13:36.416 --> 01:13:38.519
They're gonna catch up on us
and you know it!

793
01:13:39.887 --> 01:13:42.823
Me and this butter face,
we got unfinished business.

794
01:13:43.724 --> 01:13:44.892
Guess I'll see you inside.

795
01:14:00.274 --> 01:14:03.644
Why don't you tell
your friends to come out?

796
01:14:06.814 --> 01:14:08.516
I have no friends.

797
01:14:10.184 --> 01:14:11.552
No weapons.

798
01:14:14.855 --> 01:14:16.023
No vest.

799
01:14:21.095 --> 01:14:22.096
Just me.

800
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:24.799
If that's how
you want it.

801
01:14:26.133 --> 01:14:27.902
You're gonna shoot
an unarmed man?

802
01:14:28.569 --> 01:14:30.235
Come on.

803
01:14:30.237 --> 01:14:32.137
Put a bruise on me.

804
01:14:32.139 --> 01:14:34.642
Break my arm...
something.

805
01:14:35.343 --> 01:14:36.877
Let's make
this simple, then.

806
01:14:38.212 --> 01:14:40.881
All of you against me.

807
01:14:41.615 --> 01:14:44.685
Holster your weapons.

808
01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:50.124
Let's show this clown
what pain really feels like.

809
01:14:56.831 --> 01:14:59.698
Damn. I don't
have all day.

810
01:15:32.633 --> 01:15:33.734
Get the fuck up.

811
01:16:34.829 --> 01:16:35.830
Hell...

812
01:16:36.997 --> 01:16:38.132
three out of five.

813
01:16:39.166 --> 01:16:41.333
Ain't bad.

814
01:17:01.722 --> 01:17:03.124
Gotta hand it to you.

815
01:17:04.024 --> 01:17:06.125
You got some spirit.

816
01:17:06.127 --> 01:17:08.829
Still breathing, asshole.

817
01:17:28.749 --> 01:17:30.951
You wanted me
to break your arm.

818
01:17:41.996 --> 01:17:43.364
Wash your mouth.

819
01:17:46.133 --> 01:17:46.999
What did you say?

820
01:17:47.001 --> 01:17:48.903
You should wash
your fucking mouth!

821
01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:14.895
<i>Security breach.</i>

822
01:18:18.866 --> 01:18:20.134

<i>Security breach.</i>

824
01:18:28.510 --> 01:18:29.810
We got activity.

825
01:18:48.062 --> 01:18:49.296
Kodiaks!

826
01:19:01.408 --> 01:19:03.075

827
01:19:07.582 --> 01:19:09.850
- Frags out!
- Frags out!

828
01:19:34.208 --> 01:19:35.909
Fuck, I'm hit! I'm hit!

829
01:19:42.416 --> 01:19:44.182
Armor's blind
without the camera.

830
01:19:44.184 --> 01:19:45.951
<i>Spec, tell me
you got a visual.</i>

831
01:19:45.953 --> 01:19:47.221
- Sniper, top side.
- Go!

832
01:19:48.188 --> 01:19:49.189
Let's go, let's go.

833
01:19:53.494 --> 01:19:54.862
<i>Spec,
take their camera out.</i>

834
01:19:57.965 --> 01:19:59.199
Spec, you're breaking up.

835
01:20:02.036 --> 01:20:03.037
Ogs!

836
01:20:05.005 --> 01:20:06.006
<i>Spec, take the shot.</i>

01:20:07.207 --> 01:20:08.842
<i>Spec, take
the fucking shot!</i>

838
01:20:30.565 --> 01:20:31.932
Hey, fatso!

839
01:20:32.534 --> 01:20:33.535
Ogs!

840
01:20:43.911 --> 01:20:44.912
Ogs.

841
01:20:45.346 --> 01:20:46.347
Ogs.

842
01:20:50.217 --> 01:20:51.218
No, no, no.

843
01:20:55.055 --> 01:20:58.025
Left vest pocket.

844
01:21:00.928 --> 01:21:03.631
- What?
- Left vest pocket.

845
01:21:09.370 --> 01:21:11.103
I'm gonna get you
some help, Ogs.

846
01:21:11.105 --> 01:21:12.239
You...

847
01:21:13.407 --> 01:21:15.577
are gonna clear up
this whole mess...

848
01:21:16.377 --> 01:21:17.545
right, LT?

849
01:21:18.278 --> 01:21:20.147
You're gonna
save those people.

850
01:21:21.148 --> 01:21:22.149
Right?

851
01:21:23.450 --> 01:21:24.586
Damn right, we are.

852
01:21:26.588 --> 01:21:29.189
I must be
such a disappointment.

Commander Adnan.

862
01:22:46.133 --> 01:22:48.668
This ends now!

863
01:22:48.670 --> 01:22:50.037
The Four...

Both of us...

hurry the fuck up.

An elevator...

870
01:23:03.050 --> 01:23:05.118
It'll take you straight
to the VIP chamber.

871
01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:08.355
I'll see you
on the other side.

872

01:26:14.809 --> 01:26:16.243
No, no, no, no.

Get down on the floor

890
01:29:42.717 --> 01:29:44.984
Confess PIRANAS'
conspiracy on record.

891
01:29:44.986 --> 01:29:49.121
Authorize your company and
broadcast it live, nationwide.

892

Are you fucking crazy?

893
01:29:51.893 --> 01:29:54.161
They'll put me in front
of the firing squad.

894
01:29:56.764 --> 01:29:58.063
Authorize it.

895
01:29:58.065 --> 01:29:59.066
Make the call.

896
01:30:08.242 --> 01:30:10.242
It's me.

897
01:30:10.244 --> 01:30:12.511
There'll be an incoming
video upload

898
01:30:12.513 --> 01:30:14.713
through the central
PIRANAS server.

899
01:30:14.715 --> 01:30:17.018
Just broadcast it as soon

903
01:30:24.125 --> 01:30:26.627
Do it, or your ass

- Ethan, no!
- Stop.

909
01:31:10.538 --> 01:31:11.605
Just stop.

910
01:31:27.722 --> 01:31:30.289

happened here?

911
01:31:30.291 --> 01:31:32.224
Relax, Mr. President.

912
01:31:32.226 --> 01:31:34.193
Everything is under control.

913
01:31:34.195 --> 01:31:36.964
Systems back online and
Garuda One is ready to go.

01:31:44.972 --> 01:31:46.540
Congressman Angga.

915
01:31:48.576 --> 01:31:50.511
You used to have everything.

916
01:31:52.580 --> 01:31:53.647
But now...

917
01:31:55.249 --> 01:31:57.082
you're just like them.

918
01:31:57.084 --> 01:31:59.153
I never planned
for a genocide!

919
01:32:00.354 --> 01:32:01.653
You and your
PIRANAS flag did that!

920
01:32:01.655 --> 01:32:05.292
But I'm not the one who's
committing genocide, Congressman!

921
01:32:07.028 --> 01:32:08.229
The people are!

922
01:32:09.930 --> 01:32:12.331
You fed them a lie,
for God's sake!

923
01:32:12.333 --> 01:32:16.037
Great things are done
with extreme measures.

924
01:32:17.038 --> 01:32:18.806
You showed us that tonight.

925
01:32:20.207 --> 01:32:22.341
Destroyed the enemy's image,

926
01:32:22.343 --> 01:32:24.610
restored the people's
faith in us.

927
01:32:24.612 --> 01:32:27.548
All in less
than a week.

928
01:32:28.382 --> 01:32:30.584
Brilliant, Congressman.

929
01:32:31.352 --> 01:32:32.686
Brilliant.

930
01:32:33.687 --> 01:32:35.256
Now, if you please
excuse me...

931
01:32:36.690 --> 01:32:38.559
I have a public
to address.

932
01:32:39.193 --> 01:32:40.261
My, uh...

933
01:32:40.995 --> 01:32:44.198
"Heroic Act,"
as you call it.

934
01:32:45.132 --> 01:32:47.001
Goodnight, Congressman.

935
01:33:10.758 --> 01:33:12.593
And he's gone.

936
01:33:14.395 --> 01:33:15.696
It's over.

937
01:33:17.031 --> 01:33:18.397
Now, tell me.

938
01:33:18.399 --> 01:33:19.733
Was she worth it?

939
01:33:22.203 --> 01:33:24.103
Did you really think
people would stop

940
01:33:24.105 --> 01:33:26.807
just because of some
stupid confession video?

941
01:33:28.275 --> 01:33:30.377
Those primitive
will burn,

942
01:33:31.045 --> 01:33:32.744
steal,

943
01:33:32.746 --> 01:33:35.082
rape and kill
all they want.

944
01:33:36.117 --> 01:33:37.118
You know why?

945
01:33:40.221 --> 01:33:43.021
Because the hungry
cares not for justice.

946
01:33:43.023 --> 01:33:44.658
Only for their
own stomach.

947
01:33:46.694 --> 01:33:47.795
But you're wrong.

948
01:33:49.396 --> 01:33:50.731
What they care for...

949
01:33:52.399 --> 01:33:54.001
is to see you dead!

950
01:33:57.171 --> 01:33:59.006
Get the fuck
out of here!

951
01:35:44.845 --> 01:35:46.247
Will you look at that?

952
01:35:47.248 --> 01:35:48.313
Huh?

953
01:35:48.315 --> 01:35:49.450
Last bullet!

954
01:35:50.184 --> 01:35:53.220
Oh, don't look
at me like that.

955
01:35:53.854 --> 01:35:56.023
You think
I'm the bad guy?

956
01:35:57.891 --> 01:36:02.196
You have no idea what monsters
this world can create!

957
01:36:02.997 --> 01:36:04.265
You chose them!

958
01:36:05.232 --> 01:36:07.201
So, bleed for them!

959
01:36:13.841 --> 01:36:16.043
Pleasure working with
you again, Lieutenant!

960
01:36:23.951 --> 01:36:26.885
PIRANAS! PIRANAS!

961
01:36:26.887 --> 01:36:28.353
PIRANAS!

962
01:36:28.355 --> 01:36:29.855
PIRANAS!

963
01:36:29.857 --> 01:36:31.256
PIRANAS!

964
01:36:31.258 --> 01:36:32.259
PIRANAS!

965
01:36:47.174 --> 01:36:49.443
<i>My beloved countrymen...</i>

966
01:36:51.178 --> 01:36:52.313
<i>this morning...</i>

967
01:36:53.947 --> 01:36:55.981
<i>the Reform
has committed</i>

968
01:36:55.983 --> 01:36:59.918
<i>their most heinous and
cowardly act of terror.</i>

969
01:37:02.256 --> 01:37:03.558
<i>I am angry.</i>

970
01:37:05.359 --> 01:37:06.592
<i>I am furious!</i>

971
01:37:10.297 --> 01:37:14.567
<i>With this law,
every citizen...</i>

972
01:37:14.569 --> 01:37:19.306
<i>is now legally responsible
for all members of the Reform.</i>

973
01:37:21.241 --> 01:37:26.512
<i>Starting tonight,
your hunger will be fulfilled!</i>

974
01:37:28.616 --> 01:37:34.088
<i>We will hunt down those
separatist traitors to the ground!</i>

975
01:37:35.222 --> 01:37:38.223
<i>So, let
the manhunt begin!</i>

976
01:37:38.225 --> 01:37:39.491
PIRANAS!

977
01:37:39.493 --> 01:37:40.961
PIRANAS!

978
01:38:14.562 --> 01:38:15.630
Done with it.

979
01:38:16.997 --> 01:38:18.098
So...

980
01:38:19.099 --> 01:38:20.234
done with it.

981
01:38:43.490 --> 01:38:46.291
PIRANAS! PIRANAS!

982
01:38:46.293 --> 01:38:47.627
PIRANAS!

983
01:38:47.629 --> 01:38:49.194
PIRANAS!

984
01:38:49.196 --> 01:38:50.598
PIRANAS!

985
01:38:57.672 --> 01:38:59.641
<i>You used to have everything.</i>

986
01:39:01.408 --> 01:39:02.510
What is this?

987
01:39:04.144 --> 01:39:05.279
Who put this up?

988
01:39:06.046 --> 01:39:07.147
<i>But now...</i>

989
01:39:08.382 --> 01:39:09.584
<i>you're just like them.</i>

990
01:39:11.185 --> 01:39:12.518
<i>I never planned
for a genocide!</i>

991
01:39:12.520 --> 01:39:15.287
- Hey, shut it down.
- <i>You and your PIRANAS flag did that!</i>

992
01:39:15.289 --> 01:39:16.254
- Shut it down, now.
- <i>But I'm not the one</i>

993
01:39:16.256 --> 01:39:18.593
<i>who's committing genocide,
Congressman!</i>

994
01:39:19.761 --> 01:39:21.326
<i>The people are!</i>

995
01:39:21.328 --> 01:39:22.461
You lied to us!

996
01:39:22.463 --> 01:39:23.698
<i>Good citizens...</i>

997
01:39:25.332 --> 01:39:26.333
<i>Hear me.</i>

998
01:39:27.434 --> 01:39:29.468
<i>This is a setup.</i>

999
01:39:29.470 --> 01:39:32.072
<i>Just another of those
Reform's plots.</i>

1000
01:39:39.313 --> 01:39:40.481
<i>And, listen...</i>

1001
01:39:46.253 --> 01:39:47.988
<i>Get me out
of here, now!</i>

1002
01:40:47.414 --> 01:40:48.583
Get out of my way.

1003
01:41:01.295 --> 01:41:03.765
I said, get the fuck
out of my way.

1004
01:41:24.151 --> 01:41:25.483
That motherfucker.

1005
01:42:00.922 --> 01:42:04.422
<i>It's been a week since the
President's infamous confession leaked</i>

1006
01:42:04.424 --> 01:42:05.925
<i>and went viral.</i>

1007
01:42:05.927 --> 01:42:08.527
<i>The President
and his administration</i>

1008
01:42:08.529 --> 01:42:10.730
<i>are being labeled
as suspects,</i>

1009
01:42:10.732 --> 01:42:13.899
<i>and will be put on trial
sometime next week.</i>

1010
01:42:13.901 --> 01:42:15.534
<i>The question
still remains,</i>

1011
01:42:15.536 --> 01:42:17.872
<i>is the President
a patriot or a traitor?</i>

1012
01:42:18.338 --> 01:42:19.471
<i>But recently,</i>

1013
01:42:19.473 --> 01:42:23.609
<i>there may be arguably
bigger questions at play.</i>

1014
01:42:23.611 --> 01:42:26.179
<i>Who is this man
behind the camera?</i>

1015
01:42:27.447 --> 01:42:28.914
<i>Who the people
are now calling,</i>

1016
01:42:28.916 --> 01:42:32.250
<i>"the hero of
the new Republic."</i>

1017
01:42:32.252 --> 01:42:35.621
<i>We now know that his
name is Ethan Suryadi,</i>

1018
01:42:35.623 --> 01:42:39.359
<i>a former Indonesian Marine
officer turned small-time vlogger.</i>

1019
01:42:41.896 --> 01:42:43.564
<i>Did Ethan work alone?</i>

1020
01:42:44.732 --> 01:42:46.233
<i>Who else was involved?</i>

1021
01:42:47.802 --> 01:42:49.300
<i>It seems like
we'll be getting</i>

1022
01:42:49.302 --> 01:42:50.938
<i>more questions
than answers.</i>

1023
01:42:52.006 --> 01:42:53.373
<i>At least, for now.</i>

1024
01:43:12.292 --> 01:43:13.592
Good look on you.

1025
01:43:14.962 --> 01:43:16.531
Not so bad yourself.

1026
01:43:19.433 --> 01:43:21.634
I guess you found
Spec's body.

1027
01:43:21.636 --> 01:43:22.702
No.

1028
01:43:22.704 --> 01:43:25.771
It was just blood.
Lots of it.

1029
01:43:25.773 --> 01:43:26.974
He couldn't have survived it.

1030
01:43:28.943 --> 01:43:30.310
And Tino?

1031
01:43:31.546 --> 01:43:32.712
Bailed.

1032
01:43:32.714 --> 01:43:34.880
No goodbye, nothing.

1033
01:43:34.882 --> 01:43:36.383
Who knows
what he's up to.

1034
01:43:54.502 --> 01:43:55.503
Excuse me.

1035
01:44:05.947 --> 01:44:07.548
Permission to return this.

1036
01:44:09.917 --> 01:44:11.318
In honor
of your son, ma'am.

1037
01:44:21.394 --> 01:44:22.563
You were with him.

1038
01:44:25.099 --> 01:44:26.433
What was he like?

1039
01:44:29.804 --> 01:44:31.271
Best man
I've known, ma'am.

1040
01:44:34.509 --> 01:44:35.676
Best man I'll ever know.

1041
01:44:38.980 --> 01:44:40.347
That's my son.

1042
01:45:21.055 --> 01:45:22.056
Hungry?

1043
01:45:26.127 --> 01:45:27.327
No.

1044
01:45:28.563 --> 01:45:29.664
No, I'm good.

1045
01:45:32.499 --> 01:45:33.634
The book you gave me...

1046
01:45:35.069 --> 01:45:38.904
The fox pin and the last
pages were burned in the fire.

1047
01:45:38.906 --> 01:45:40.741
Guess I'll never know
the ending.

1048
01:45:43.778 --> 01:45:45.445
We'll just have to
make our own, then.

1049
01:45:48.415 --> 01:45:49.482
Won't we?

1050
01:45:56.456 --> 01:45:59.124
<i>Food for all! Food for all!</i>

1051
01:45:59.126 --> 01:46:01.861
<i>Food for all!
Food for all!</i>

1052
01:46:01.863 --> 01:46:04.730
<i>Food for all!
Food for all!</i>

1053
01:46:04.732 --> 01:46:07.600
<i>Food for all!
Food for all!</i>

1054
01:46:07.602 --> 01:46:10.037
<i>Food for all!
Food for all...</i>

1055
01:54:01.008 --> 01:54:03.043
- Whoa.
- Shit.

1056
01:54:05.346 --> 01:54:08.146
When's the last time
you had chocolate?

1057
01:54:08.148 --> 01:54:10.117
When's the last time
we could afford it?

1058
01:54:23.714 --> 01:54:28.714
