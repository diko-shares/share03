1
00:01:41.118 --> 00:01:42.201
Do you know him?

2
00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:37.800
- Rambo...
- Rambo...

3
00:06:37.884 --> 00:06:40.217
- Rambo...
- Rambo...

4
00:06:45.383 --> 00:06:46.424
John!

5
00:06:47.716 --> 00:06:48.758
John!

6
00:07:56.085 --> 00:07:58.751
Where is the man called Rambo?

7
00:08:19.458 --> 00:08:20.625
John!

8
00:08:21.583 --> 00:08:22.874
John Rambo!

9
00:08:28.332 --> 00:08:29.624
I don't believe this.

10
00:08:37.415 --> 00:08:38.623
So where did you come in from?

11
00:08:38.706 --> 00:08:39.748
Washington.

12
00:08:40.956 --> 00:08:42.706
- Good to see you again.
- Yeah. You, too.

13
00:08:45.289 --> 00:08:46.997
You want to tell me about it?

14
00:08:48.039 --> 00:08:49.247
About what?

15
00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:51.580
About how yesterday
I see you stick fighting

16
00:08:51.664 --> 00:08:52.997
in a warehouse in Bangkok.

17
00:08:53.913 --> 00:08:55.746
- You saw that?
- Yeah.

18
00:08:56.788 --> 00:08:59.371
And today I find you
working in a monastery.

19
00:09:00.621 --> 00:09:03.371
They let me live here,
and I help out, fixing things.

20
00:09:03.829 --> 00:09:05.037
And the stick fighting?

21
00:09:05.746 --> 00:09:07.579
I just do that
for a little extra money.

22
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:12.078
Yeah... I saw you give it
to the monks.

23
00:09:13.328 --> 00:09:14.453
You see a lot.

24
00:09:17.828 --> 00:09:18.953
Colonel, who are they?

25
00:09:19.536 --> 00:09:20.953
They're part of the reason I'm here.

26
00:09:21.411 --> 00:09:22.452
Bob.

27
00:09:23.786 --> 00:09:24.994
This is Robert Griggs.

28
00:09:25.077 --> 00:09:26.952
He's a field officer
with our local embassy.

29
00:09:27.285 --> 00:09:28.577
John Rambo.

30
00:09:29.494 --> 00:09:30.577
Pleasure.

31
00:09:30.952 --> 00:09:32.785
Well, you're sure not easy to find.

32
00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:34.701
Why are you keepin' track?

33
00:09:35.576 --> 00:09:38.618
Well, like the colonel says,
good men are hard to find.

34
00:09:41.992 --> 00:09:45.159
John, I'd like you to take a look
at some of these photos.

35
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.200
I don't know how much you know
about Afghanistan.

36
00:09:48.742 --> 00:09:50.783
Most people can't even find it
on a map.

37
00:09:52.117 --> 00:09:53.741
But over two million civilians

38
00:09:54.658 --> 00:09:56.533
mostly peasant farmers
and their families

39
00:09:56.616 --> 00:09:59.533
have been systematically slaughtered
by invading Russian armies.

40
00:10:00.949 --> 00:10:02.157
Every new weapon...

41
00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:07.907
including chemical warfare

42
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:09.532
has been used
to eliminate these people.

43
00:10:10.115 --> 00:10:12.198
And they've been very successful
on many levels.

44
00:10:13.948 --> 00:10:17.364
I assume that you're out of touch
with the current status of the war.

45
00:10:18.114 --> 00:10:19.781
But after nine years of fighting

46
00:10:20.531 --> 00:10:23.280
the Afghan forces are now getting
shipments of Stinger missiles

47
00:10:23.364 --> 00:10:25.280
and are beginning to hold their own
against air strikes.

48
00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:29.530
Except for one region,
50 miles over the border.

49
00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:33.905
Apparently, the Soviet commander
there is exceptionally brutal

50
00:10:33.988 --> 00:10:35.321
as those photos indicate.

51
00:10:36.113 --> 00:10:39.112
And he's managed to strangle off
all aid from the outside.

52
00:10:40.571 --> 00:10:43.445
So we want to...

53
00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.612
investigate the problem firsthand.

54
00:10:47.112 --> 00:10:48.487
And what that's got to do with me?

55
00:10:50.945 --> 00:10:52.486
They've asked me to go in.

56
00:10:53.111 --> 00:10:54.444
You're not gonna do it?

57
00:10:54.736 --> 00:10:58.069
Yes. And I want you
to come with me, John.

58
00:10:58.569 --> 00:10:59.986
I put in my time.

59
00:11:00.611 --> 00:11:01.652
What does that mean?

60
00:11:03.277 --> 00:11:04.818
It means my war is over.

61
00:11:16.109 --> 00:11:18.109
I thought you said
he was this great soldier.

62
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:21.484
Well, Colonel...

63
00:11:22.067 --> 00:11:24.775
looks like we've got a long walk
down those stairs.

64
00:11:41.024 --> 00:11:43.898
Don't be down on him.
He's just following orders.

65
00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:47.481
This mission's important, John.

66
00:11:48.606 --> 00:11:50.148
Do you really think
we're gonna make a difference?

67
00:11:50.231 --> 00:11:51.731
If I didn't, I wouldn't be going.

68
00:11:51.814 --> 00:11:54.397
- It didn't before.
- That was another time.

69
00:11:56.439 --> 00:11:57.564
Come with me, John.

70
00:12:03.063 --> 00:12:06.771
I don't know what you think
about this place, but I like it.

71
00:12:07.438 --> 00:12:10.271
I like bein' here,
I like workin' here.

72
00:12:10.854 --> 00:12:12.021
I like belonging to something.

73
00:12:12.104 --> 00:12:14.854
You do belong into something.
Not this.

74
00:12:16.271 --> 00:12:17.937
When are you gonna come full circle?

75
00:12:18.187 --> 00:12:19.437
What are you talkin' about?

76
00:12:20.645 --> 00:12:22.687
You said that your war is over.

77
00:12:22.895 --> 00:12:25.978
I think the one out there is,
but not the one inside you.

78
00:12:26.978 --> 00:12:29.978
I know the reasons you're here, John.
But it doesn't work that way.

79
00:12:30.853 --> 00:12:33.936
You may try, but you can't get away
from what you really are.

80
00:12:34.894 --> 00:12:37.894
- And what do you think I am?
- A full-blooded combat soldier.

81
00:12:37.977 --> 00:12:40.227
Not anymore. I don't want it.

82
00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:42.185
That's too bad,
'cause you're stuck with it.

83
00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:44.518
Let me tell you a story, John.

84
00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:46.435
There was a sculptor

85
00:12:46.976 --> 00:12:48.684
and he found a stone,
a special stone.

86
00:12:49.476 --> 00:12:51.767
He dragged it home
and he worked on it for months

87
00:12:51.851 --> 00:12:52.934
until he finally finished.

88
00:12:54.017 --> 00:12:55.350
When he was ready,
he showed it to his friends

89
00:12:55.434 --> 00:12:57.517
and they said
he had created a great statue.

90
00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:00.642
The sculptor said
he hadn't created anything.

91
00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:02.267
The statue was always there.

92
00:13:03.391 --> 00:13:05.558
He just cleared away
the small pieces.

93
00:13:07.641 --> 00:13:09.558
We didn't make you
this fighting machine.

94
00:13:10.891 --> 00:13:12.599
We just chipped away the rough edges.

95
00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:16.015
You're always going to be
tearing away at yourself

96
00:13:16.099 --> 00:13:18.057
until you come to terms
with what you are.

97
00:13:18.848 --> 00:13:20.390
Until you come full circle.

98
00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:25.264
I guess I'm not ready yet.

99
00:13:31.472 --> 00:13:33.347
Well, I got to move.

100
00:13:35.639 --> 00:13:38.722
Promise me you'll look me up
when you get Stateside, huh?

101
00:13:40.055 --> 00:13:41.096
I promise.

102
00:13:41.846 --> 00:13:42.888
Colonel...

103
00:13:43.763 --> 00:13:47.346
I'm sorry.
But it's gotta end for me sometime.

104
00:13:49.637 --> 00:13:50.762
I understand.

105
00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:16.171
Take cover!

106
00:15:41.961 --> 00:15:45.336
<i>Drop your weapons
and remain where you are!</i>

107
00:15:46.252 --> 00:15:47.877
<i>You cannot escape!</i>

108
00:15:53.668 --> 00:15:54.918
<i>Drop your weapons!</i>

109
00:15:55.501 --> 00:15:57.709
<i>You have no chance of escape!</i>

110
00:15:59.668 --> 00:16:01.292
<i>Drop your weapons!</i>

111
00:16:01.834 --> 00:16:02.917
<i>Now!</i>

112
00:16:28.873 --> 00:16:29.915
Rambo.

113
00:16:31.873 --> 00:16:33.248
Something went wrong.

114
00:16:33.331 --> 00:16:34.415
What happened?

115
00:16:35.289 --> 00:16:37.581
Soviets intercepted the team,
just over the border.

116
00:16:39.247 --> 00:16:42.206
From what we've gathered,
Trautman and the rest of his party

117
00:16:42.289 --> 00:16:44.289
have been taken
to the regional commandment post.

118
00:16:44.705 --> 00:16:46.039
And what are you doing about it?

119
00:16:48.205 --> 00:16:49.497
I can't do anything about it.

120
00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.288
I'm sorry.

121
00:16:52.246 --> 00:16:53.538
I just thought you should know.

122
00:16:56.079 --> 00:16:57.163
What about me?

123
00:16:59.537 --> 00:17:00.579
What about you?

124
00:17:01.037 --> 00:17:02.120
Can you get me in?

125
00:17:03.162 --> 00:17:04.329
You're not serious.

126
00:17:04.662 --> 00:17:05.912
Oh, yeah, I'm serious.

127
00:17:08.745 --> 00:17:10.036
It can't be done officially.

128
00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:11.411
Make it unofficial.

129
00:17:12.995 --> 00:17:15.494
If it can be done,
I want you to know upfront

130
00:17:15.578 --> 00:17:18.494
that if you're captured,
or if any of this leaks

131
00:17:18.994 --> 00:17:22.369
we'll deny any participation,
or even knowledge of your existence.

132
00:17:24.327 --> 00:17:25.618
I'm used to it.

133
00:17:27.327 --> 00:17:28.535
We'll get back.

134
00:18:53.777 --> 00:18:54.944
You want to buy?

135
00:18:55.819 --> 00:18:57.069
Many guns here.

136
00:18:57.152 --> 00:18:59.902
No. I'm looking for Mousa Chanin.

137
00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:03.193
- What's your name?
- John Rambo.

138
00:19:06.901 --> 00:19:08.068
Wait here.

139
00:19:31.066 --> 00:19:32.566
They sell many in Afghanistan.

140
00:19:34.982 --> 00:19:36.232
Many land mines.

141
00:19:37.107 --> 00:19:38.565
Land mines everywhere.

142
00:19:40.357 --> 00:19:42.940
I am Mousa Chanin.
What is it you want?

143
00:19:43.023 --> 00:19:44.231
I was sent by Griggs.

144
00:19:45.856 --> 00:19:48.231
You do not look like men
Griggs sent before.

145
00:19:48.606 --> 00:19:50.939
You not look like
you are with military.

146
00:19:51.772 --> 00:19:52.814
I'm not.

147
00:19:52.897 --> 00:19:54.814
What you are? A mercenary?

148
00:19:56.272 --> 00:19:57.397
No.

149
00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.772
You're not with military,
you're not mercenary? What are you?

150
00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.730
Lost tourist?

151
00:20:07.854 --> 00:20:09.187
I'm no tourist.

152
00:20:11.104 --> 00:20:12.354
Sorry.

153
00:20:12.687 --> 00:20:14.437
Now, do you know
where the American is?

154
00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.895
Yes. In Soviet fort.

155
00:20:17.228 --> 00:20:20.561
Near the village of Khost,
30 miles over border.

156
00:20:21.728 --> 00:20:24.228
Mr. Griggs sent you
the supplies you asked for.

157
00:20:24.853 --> 00:20:27.269
- You wish to see them now?
- Yeah.

158
00:20:30.269 --> 00:20:31.477
Is this what you asked for?

159
00:20:31.977 --> 00:20:33.060
Yeah.

160
00:20:33.894 --> 00:20:35.810
Never see these things before.
What are these?

161
00:20:36.435 --> 00:20:37.602
Detonators.

162
00:20:38.435 --> 00:20:39.518
And this?

163
00:20:40.268 --> 00:20:41.435
What is this for?

164
00:20:42.851 --> 00:20:43.934
It's a blue light.

165
00:20:44.601 --> 00:20:45.726
What does it do?

166
00:20:46.601 --> 00:20:47.684
It turns blue.

167
00:20:49.309 --> 00:20:50.350
I see.

168
00:20:51.142 --> 00:20:53.350
Can you tell me
how many more men come with us?

169
00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:55.433
There's no rescue team.
There's just me.

170
00:20:56.142 --> 00:20:58.058
Just you? Come on, this is no good!

171
00:20:58.308 --> 00:21:00.016
I cannot take only one man
to the fort.

172
00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:01.433
You need more men to help.

173
00:21:02.516 --> 00:21:05.099
Griggs said you'd take me in.
Take me in.

174
00:21:05.891 --> 00:21:07.891
I am needed to take medical supplies.

175
00:21:07.974 --> 00:21:10.140
If I not take it,
many people will die.

176
00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:11.515
Do you understand?

177
00:21:13.348 --> 00:21:15.348
Well, I do not know
who you really are

178
00:21:15.723 --> 00:21:16.765
but by the way you look

179
00:21:16.848 --> 00:21:18.348
I can see
you have no experience in war.

180
00:21:18.431 --> 00:21:19.640
Do you?

181
00:21:20.598 --> 00:21:21.639
Come on, do you?

182
00:21:22.723 --> 00:21:24.264
I've fired a few shots.

183
00:21:28.514 --> 00:21:29.597
"A few shots"?

184
00:21:30.847 --> 00:21:33.763
Come on,
maybe you should go back home

185
00:21:33.847 --> 00:21:35.138
and think it all over again.

186
00:21:35.555 --> 00:21:36.930
For a very long time.

187
00:21:41.096 --> 00:21:42.513
I did think it over.

188
00:21:44.179 --> 00:21:45.221
You did?

189
00:21:47.054 --> 00:21:49.387
Well, this is your choice.

190
00:21:49.845 --> 00:21:53.470
But let me tell you,
you cannot get this American alone.

191
00:21:54.428 --> 00:21:56.803
If you fail, do not blame me.

192
00:21:57.428 --> 00:21:59.178
I will accept no responsibility.

193
00:22:01.594 --> 00:22:02.844
Sounds familiar.

194
00:22:38.049 --> 00:22:41.674
My name is Colonel Zaysen,
Regional Commander of this sector.

195
00:22:46.299 --> 00:22:49.382
You realize you're the first
American captured in Afghanistan?

196
00:22:51.007 --> 00:22:52.256
Congratulations.

197
00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:57.506
I believe you're planning
to supply enemy rebel forces

198
00:22:57.589 --> 00:23:01.256
with Stinger missiles,
intending to destroy Soviet aircraft.

199
00:23:01.964 --> 00:23:03.464
If I'm gonna be interrogated

200
00:23:03.547 --> 00:23:06.005
I wanna be interrogated
by your superiors.

201
00:23:07.963 --> 00:23:11.088
Out here, I have no superiors.

202
00:23:12.713 --> 00:23:14.338
I am in full command.

203
00:23:16.463 --> 00:23:17.837
You are alone here.

204
00:23:22.629 --> 00:23:24.462
Abandoned by your government.

205
00:23:26.295 --> 00:23:27.503
What do you want?

206
00:23:28.712 --> 00:23:29.961
Cooperation.

207
00:23:32.836 --> 00:23:35.836
This sector has been
under total control

208
00:23:35.919 --> 00:23:37.252
for over five years.

209
00:23:39.044 --> 00:23:41.210
There is little more I can do here.

210
00:23:42.502 --> 00:23:46.793
It is, as you say,
without challenges.

211
00:23:49.876 --> 00:23:52.001
If you supply to me
worthy information

212
00:23:52.084 --> 00:23:54.501
about most Stinger missiles
you're planning to deliver

213
00:23:55.084 --> 00:23:57.584
it could provide a way out of this
for us both.

214
00:23:58.667 --> 00:24:03.125
After all, in the end
what everyone really wants...

215
00:24:04.167 --> 00:24:05.500
is peace.

216
00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:08.375
The Kremlin's got a hell
of a sense of humor.

217
00:24:09.875 --> 00:24:11.041
Please explain.

218
00:24:11.499 --> 00:24:13.999
You talk peace and disarmament
to the world

219
00:24:14.458 --> 00:24:16.874
and here you are,
wiping out a race of people.

220
00:24:17.249 --> 00:24:19.749
We are wiping out no one.

221
00:24:20.707 --> 00:24:25.123
I think you're too intelligent
to believe such absurd propaganda!

222
00:24:26.331 --> 00:24:28.581
Now again, where are the missiles?

223
00:24:28.665 --> 00:24:30.456
I don't know anything
about any missiles!

224
00:24:30.539 --> 00:24:31.664
Of course you do!

225
00:24:31.956 --> 00:24:35.331
But you do not seem to realize
I'm providing a way out for us both.

226
00:24:35.539 --> 00:24:36.831
You expect sympathy?

227
00:24:38.289 --> 00:24:40.497
You started this damn war,
now you have to deal with it!

228
00:24:40.705 --> 00:24:41.747
And we will.

229
00:24:41.955 --> 00:24:44.913
It is just a matter of time
before we achieve a complete victory.

230
00:24:44.997 --> 00:24:46.371
You know there won't be a victory.

231
00:24:46.871 --> 00:24:49.288
Every day,
your war machines lose ground

232
00:24:49.371 --> 00:24:52.413
to a bunch of poorly-armed,
poorly-equipped freedom fighters!

233
00:24:52.871 --> 00:24:55.204
The fact is that you underestimated
your competition.

234
00:24:55.787 --> 00:24:56.954
If you studied your history

235
00:24:57.037 --> 00:24:58.787
you'd know that these people
have never given up to anyone.

236
00:24:59.287 --> 00:25:03.120
They'd rather die
than be slaves to an invading army.

237
00:25:03.578 --> 00:25:04.995
You can't defeat a people like that.

238
00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:08.494
We tried. We already had our Vietnam!

239
00:25:09.786 --> 00:25:11.161
Now you're gonna have yours.

240
00:25:11.411 --> 00:25:15.535
So, you wish to test me? Good.

241
00:25:55.074 --> 00:25:56.824
This is Afghanistan.

242
00:25:57.948 --> 00:26:00.198
Alexander the Great
tried to conquer this country

243
00:26:00.615 --> 00:26:04.740
then Genghis Khan,
then the British, now Russia.

244
00:26:05.823 --> 00:26:08.323
But Afghan people fight hard,
they never be defeated.

245
00:26:09.739 --> 00:26:11.739
Ancient enemy make prayer
about these people.

246
00:26:12.197 --> 00:26:13.239
Do you wish to hear?

247
00:26:14.447 --> 00:26:16.822
Very good. It says...

248
00:26:17.572 --> 00:26:20.196
"May God deliver us
from the venom of the cobra

249
00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:23.030
teeth of the tiger,
and the vengeance of the Afghans."

250
00:26:25.779 --> 00:26:27.071
Understand what this means?

251
00:26:28.987 --> 00:26:30.821
That you guys don't take any shit.

252
00:26:32.654 --> 00:26:35.278
Yes, something like this.

253
00:26:39.945 --> 00:26:41.153
We go now.

254
00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:18.858
In the north, there are many caves.
We will travel through them.

255
00:27:19.733 --> 00:27:21.441
It'll be safer. We go.

256
00:27:26.274 --> 00:27:28.815
This cave leads us
to the Valley of the Five Lions.

257
00:27:29.274 --> 00:27:31.524
In ancient days,
the Afghan king was asked

258
00:27:31.607 --> 00:27:34.190
to send 500 of his warriors
into battle.

259
00:27:34.565 --> 00:27:35.773
He sent only five.

260
00:27:38.981 --> 00:27:41.439
His greatest five, and they won.

261
00:27:42.398 --> 00:27:45.772
He said, "It's better to send
five lions than 500 sheep."

262
00:27:45.981 --> 00:27:48.355
- What do you think of this?
- I think the king was lucky.

263
00:27:48.689 --> 00:27:49.730
Lucky, eh?

264
00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:54.355
- How much longer till the village?
- About two hours.

265
00:28:05.979 --> 00:28:09.562
Where in my sector
are the missiles being delivered?

266
00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:14.478
I don't know.

267
00:28:15.186 --> 00:28:16.895
You're a liar.

268
00:28:20.019 --> 00:28:21.144
Where?

269
00:28:24.852 --> 00:28:26.102
Where?

270
00:28:26.727 --> 00:28:28.560
All right... I'll tell.

271
00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:31.727
I knew you were lying.

272
00:28:33.768 --> 00:28:37.518
Now, where are the missiles located?

273
00:28:38.809 --> 00:28:40.059
Close.

274
00:28:40.892 --> 00:28:42.059
How close?

275
00:28:44.475 --> 00:28:45.850
In your ass.

276
00:28:58.724 --> 00:29:01.474
You've tried my patience long enough.

277
00:29:09.057 --> 00:29:11.015
I tried to be civilized.

278
00:29:43.387 --> 00:29:44.887
The name John Rambo...

279
00:29:49.845 --> 00:29:51.095
do you know it?

280
00:29:53.553 --> 00:29:54.636
No?

281
00:29:55.803 --> 00:29:59.261
He says there are plans
for a rescue attempt

282
00:29:59.344 --> 00:30:00.760
with the help of some rebels.

283
00:30:01.469 --> 00:30:04.843
He also says he knows
where this man is going.

284
00:30:09.093 --> 00:30:10.301
We will welcome him.

285
00:30:29.508 --> 00:30:31.008
This is the last village
in the valley.

286
00:30:31.424 --> 00:30:32.966
About 100 men here.

287
00:30:35.174 --> 00:30:36.466
There are a lot of kids here.

288
00:30:36.549 --> 00:30:39.424
Yes, and they are good fighters, too.

289
00:30:40.257 --> 00:30:41.882
I'll tell the leaders
you want to talk.

290
00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:50.048
They've never seen men look like you.

291
00:30:58.130 --> 00:30:59.755
These are Mujahideen horsemen.

292
00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:02.672
There are 10,000 horsemen more
waiting at the border.

293
00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:04.713
They are waiting to get weapons.

294
00:31:04.797 --> 00:31:06.880
When they'll get it,
they'll come back here to fight.

295
00:31:25.753 --> 00:31:27.003
Let's go to the hospital.

296
00:31:33.127 --> 00:31:35.335
He's the only doctor for 500km.

297
00:31:39.293 --> 00:31:41.168
The first medicine
they get in two months.

298
00:31:50.542 --> 00:31:52.209
More gifts from the Soviets.

299
00:31:52.292 --> 00:31:53.917
They look like toys,
but they're mines.

300
00:31:54.792 --> 00:31:57.584
We teach the children not to touch,
some of them too late.

301
00:32:01.625 --> 00:32:02.791
Who's that?

302
00:32:03.708 --> 00:32:05.583
His name is Uri. He's Russian.

303
00:32:06.125 --> 00:32:07.167
A deserter?

304
00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:10.167
He calls himself a defector.
There are many like him.

305
00:32:10.625 --> 00:32:14.126
He is the one who can help the most.
He knows the inside of the fort.

306
00:32:18.418 --> 00:32:19.626
I think we should go now.

307
00:32:39.754 --> 00:32:41.045
Mines start here

308
00:32:41.379 --> 00:32:45.796
at 1m like this, then go 2m like this

309
00:32:46.129 --> 00:32:47.379
and like this.

310
00:32:47.921 --> 00:32:50.505
They have four towers, four guards

311
00:32:51.046 --> 00:32:53.838
here... and here.

312
00:32:54.589 --> 00:32:56.005
Where do they keep the prisoners?

313
00:32:56.464 --> 00:32:57.547
Here.

314
00:32:58.172 --> 00:33:01.339
If we get in there,
is there another way out?

315
00:33:02.214 --> 00:33:05.048
Underground,
where is all the bad water.

316
00:33:05.423 --> 00:33:07.882
I do not know words for this place.

317
00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:09.340
He means sewer.

318
00:33:09.882 --> 00:33:11.674
- Where is it?
- Here.

319
00:33:11.965 --> 00:33:15.299
Outside, it goes there.
Guards patrol there.

320
00:33:15.841 --> 00:33:17.758
I do not think you go this way.

321
00:33:18.466 --> 00:33:20.716
Then we should go to the minefields.
They'd never expect it.

322
00:33:21.175 --> 00:33:22.425
This cannot be done.

323
00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:25.008
In there are many Spetsnaz commandos.

324
00:33:26.009 --> 00:33:27.217
We are only this.

325
00:33:28.092 --> 00:33:29.467
We've lost many men.

326
00:33:29.884 --> 00:33:31.509
We lose more maybe if we go there.

327
00:33:32.718 --> 00:33:33.884
I don't need many men.

328
00:33:35.051 --> 00:33:36.385
What is it you want to do?

329
00:33:37.677 --> 00:33:39.343
I need two men to help me
through the minefield

330
00:33:39.427 --> 00:33:40.719
and two to help with the escape.

331
00:33:41.219 --> 00:33:44.636
If this is done,
Soviets will come here like before

332
00:33:44.719 --> 00:33:46.469
and more people will die.

333
00:33:47.303 --> 00:33:48.511
I can't wait.

334
00:33:48.803 --> 00:33:51.011
You must wait for help
the way we wait.

335
00:33:53.428 --> 00:33:54.595
Then I'll go alone.

336
00:33:54.928 --> 00:33:56.054
And you will die!

337
00:33:59.012 --> 00:34:00.221
Then I die.

338
00:34:06.096 --> 00:34:07.138
Wait!

339
00:34:08.805 --> 00:34:09.888
Please don't go.

340
00:34:18.514 --> 00:34:19.973
My name is Masoud.

341
00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:22.598
You must not judge us

342
00:34:22.681 --> 00:34:25.307
before you understand
why we are not ready to help.

343
00:34:27.849 --> 00:34:30.016
Most of the Afghan people
are very strong

344
00:34:30.391 --> 00:34:33.308
and we are determined
not to be driven from our land.

345
00:34:34.974 --> 00:34:39.892
Our children die of disease,
mines, and poison gas.

346
00:34:40.267 --> 00:34:42.434
And the women are raped and killed.

347
00:34:43.517 --> 00:34:47.351
Last year, in the Valley of Laghman,
the next valley

348
00:34:48.143 --> 00:34:50.059
6,000 Afghans were killed.

349
00:34:51.476 --> 00:34:54.685
Pregnant women were cut with bayonets

350
00:34:55.685 --> 00:34:57.977
and their babies
thrown into the fires.

351
00:34:58.685 --> 00:34:59.810
This is done

352
00:34:59.894 --> 00:35:03.144
so they will not have to fight
the next generation of Afghans.

353
00:35:03.603 --> 00:35:06.811
Yet nobody sees anything,
or reads anything in the papers.

354
00:35:08.603 --> 00:35:09.853
What you see here

355
00:35:11.395 --> 00:35:13.187
are the Mujahideen soldiers.

356
00:35:14.104 --> 00:35:15.270
Holy warriors.

357
00:35:16.271 --> 00:35:18.104
To us, this war is a holy war.

358
00:35:19.229 --> 00:35:21.521
And there is no true death
for a Mujahideen

359
00:35:21.604 --> 00:35:23.646
because we have taken our last rites

360
00:35:24.771 --> 00:35:26.980
and we consider ourselves
dead already.

361
00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:32.022
To us, death for our land
and God is an honor.

362
00:35:32.689 --> 00:35:33.856
So, my friend...

363
00:35:35.356 --> 00:35:38.356
what we must do
is to stop this killing

364
00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:40.023
of our women and children.

365
00:35:41.732 --> 00:35:43.399
If getting this man free

366
00:35:44.399 --> 00:35:46.399
so he can return to the free world

367
00:35:46.607 --> 00:35:49.191
and tell what happens here,
is necessary

368
00:35:50.274 --> 00:35:52.191
then of course we will help.

369
00:35:54.816 --> 00:35:59.109
Leave us now,
so we may speak among ourselves

370
00:35:59.692 --> 00:36:02.067
and find the best way
to free this man.

371
00:36:07.818 --> 00:36:08.860
Thank you.

372
00:36:09.568 --> 00:36:10.651
We thank you.

373
00:36:35.237 --> 00:36:37.071
Don't worry, they will decide soon.

374
00:36:38.113 --> 00:36:39.530
We have to get in there tonight.

375
00:36:39.613 --> 00:36:40.655
What is your name?

376
00:36:44.405 --> 00:36:46.114
This boy is very hard inside.

377
00:36:47.155 --> 00:36:48.739
His parents were killed last year.

378
00:36:50.322 --> 00:36:52.281
His brother died in the fort
where the American is.

379
00:36:53.156 --> 00:36:55.990
He looks like a boy,
but he fights like a man.

380
00:36:56.573 --> 00:36:59.115
- What is your name?
- Rambo.

381
00:36:59.448 --> 00:37:02.532
- Where are you from?
- Arizona.

382
00:37:02.782 --> 00:37:05.157
Arizona? How much days' walk?

383
00:37:06.032 --> 00:37:07.366
About two years.

384
00:37:07.783 --> 00:37:08.824
Two years...

385
00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:13.200
- Are you a soldier?
- No more.

386
00:37:14.367 --> 00:37:15.784
- I am a soldier.
- Yeah?

387
00:37:15.867 --> 00:37:18.576
- Are you here to fight?
- No.

388
00:37:18.867 --> 00:37:20.117
Are you scared?

389
00:37:22.909 --> 00:37:24.034
What is this?

390
00:37:25.826 --> 00:37:26.993
- It's a knife.
- Can I see this?

391
00:37:27.076 --> 00:37:28.118
Sure.

392
00:37:36.369 --> 00:37:37.953
Very good. Can I have it?

393
00:37:38.286 --> 00:37:39.369
No.

394
00:37:41.286 --> 00:37:43.620
- What is this?
- You want everything!

395
00:37:43.828 --> 00:37:46.454
- This is for luck.
- What is luck?

396
00:37:46.912 --> 00:37:48.037
Luck is...

397
00:37:50.996 --> 00:37:52.663
Can I have it? I need luck.

398
00:37:52.954 --> 00:37:53.996
So do I.

399
00:37:57.746 --> 00:37:58.872
Look what a child.

400
00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:00.913
Always like this.

401
00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:06.664
Look there. It's the national sport.

402
00:38:07.456 --> 00:38:10.414
Old insane game,
maybe 3,000 years old.

403
00:38:11.081 --> 00:38:12.540
Look, they never stop playing it.

404
00:38:16.623 --> 00:38:18.374
War, not war, they don't mind.

405
00:38:19.749 --> 00:38:22.166
- You like it?
- I'll take football.

406
00:38:22.791 --> 00:38:25.791
Football? What's football?
You play it with your foot?

407
00:38:26.333 --> 00:38:27.416
Not really.

408
00:38:38.334 --> 00:38:39.709
Come on... let's go!

409
00:38:51.711 --> 00:38:54.128
- What are they saying?
- They want you to try it.

410
00:38:55.253 --> 00:38:56.836
It's a way to welcome you
to be with them.

411
00:38:57.128 --> 00:39:01.128
If you want to try, go ahead
but I am not responsible for it.

412
00:39:05.879 --> 00:39:07.671
- I'll try it.
- Yes?

413
00:39:10.046 --> 00:39:11.213
What are the rules?

414
00:39:11.588 --> 00:39:14.671
Well, you have to take the sheep
once around

415
00:39:14.755 --> 00:39:16.255
and then thrown it in the circle.

416
00:39:17.255 --> 00:39:18.297
Why?

417
00:39:18.839 --> 00:39:19.964
Because there is a circle there.

418
00:39:21.922 --> 00:39:24.339
- That's it?
- That's it. Very simple.

419
00:39:26.631 --> 00:39:27.840
Like football.

420
00:39:28.506 --> 00:39:30.423
God must love crazy people.

421
00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:33.173
- Why?
- He makes so many of them.

422
00:44:14.454 --> 00:44:15.662
Take cover, take cover!

423
00:44:16.121 --> 00:44:17.663
Move, move!

424
00:47:11.765 --> 00:47:13.473
Now you see how it is here.

425
00:47:15.265 --> 00:47:18.224
Somewhere in a war,
there's supposed to be honor.

426
00:47:18.766 --> 00:47:21.349
Where is the honor here? Where?

427
00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:26.850
We're taking the survivors
to the border. Are you coming?

428
00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:29.975
I'm going to the fort.

429
00:47:30.559 --> 00:47:32.309
Have you not seen enough death?

430
00:47:33.267 --> 00:47:35.809
Go. Go while you can.

431
00:47:36.268 --> 00:47:37.601
This is not your war.

432
00:47:41.018 --> 00:47:42.310
It is now.

433
00:47:46.602 --> 00:47:47.811
So be it.

434
00:47:49.769 --> 00:47:51.186
We are good friends.

435
00:47:53.144 --> 00:47:54.520
God willing.

436
00:48:01.687 --> 00:48:04.271
I stay. I will show you the way.

437
00:48:04.937 --> 00:48:06.146
I will go too.

438
00:48:07.146 --> 00:48:08.521
No, you go with them.

439
00:48:08.896 --> 00:48:11.521
I will not.
They killed all my family.

440
00:48:11.896 --> 00:48:13.147
I want to fight!

441
00:48:14.188 --> 00:48:15.397
Not with me.

442
00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:17.314
You go.

443
00:48:18.147 --> 00:48:19.272
Go on.

444
00:48:24.731 --> 00:48:26.023
Why must you do this?

445
00:48:28.107 --> 00:48:29.607
'Cause he'd do it for me.

446
00:48:55.610 --> 00:48:57.526
Have you decided to talk?

447
00:48:58.818 --> 00:49:00.027
No?

448
00:49:01.068 --> 00:49:02.360
Very well.

449
00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:06.027
Soon you will be my guest
down the hall.

450
00:49:59.033 --> 00:50:00.075
Come on.

451
00:50:39.496 --> 00:50:41.121
- Go back!
- No!

452
00:50:41.204 --> 00:50:42.246
Go back!

453
00:51:10.791 --> 00:51:11.958
Go on!

454
00:51:14.166 --> 00:51:15.791
Stay here! Stay back.

455
00:51:15.875 --> 00:51:17.708
I know this place. You need me!

456
00:51:17.792 --> 00:51:20.334
I don't need you dead!
Now go back. You understand?

457
00:58:23.296 --> 00:58:24.463
American?

458
00:58:25.963 --> 00:58:27.130
American?

459
00:58:49.757 --> 00:58:52.466
Colonel...

460
00:58:57.467 --> 00:59:00.175
John? How the hell
did you get in here?

461
00:59:00.259 --> 00:59:02.925
- Can you move?
- You're damn right I can.

462
00:59:04.884 --> 00:59:06.092
Let's go!

463
00:59:11.218 --> 00:59:12.593
John, behind you!

464
00:59:23.136 --> 00:59:24.219
Go!

465
00:59:30.012 --> 00:59:32.970
John, get outta here!
Get the hell outta here!

466
01:00:31.477 --> 01:00:32.560
Go on.

467
01:01:29.441 --> 01:01:30.525
Over here!

468
01:01:31.858 --> 01:01:32.942
Come on!

469
01:01:39.943 --> 01:01:41.068
Help me!

470
01:02:16.238 --> 01:02:17.322
Take him!

471
01:02:39.199 --> 01:02:40.407
Come on!

472
01:02:44.199 --> 01:02:45.408
Give me the boy.

473
01:03:05.202 --> 01:03:06.285
Go!

474
01:03:18.912 --> 01:03:20.745
- Come on.
- Okay.

475
01:03:22.037 --> 01:03:23.204
Take the kid!

476
01:03:26.579 --> 01:03:27.871
Get down!

477
01:04:41.212 --> 01:04:42.379
Give me the boy!

478
01:05:37.885 --> 01:05:39.177
Who is this terrorist?

479
01:05:39.677 --> 01:05:41.635
What makes you so valuable to him?

480
01:05:42.386 --> 01:05:45.261
This bastard
tried to destroy me tonight.

481
01:05:45.344 --> 01:05:46.428
But he failed!

482
01:05:46.511 --> 01:05:48.595
At sunrise, I will hunt him down

483
01:05:48.678 --> 01:05:50.386
and have his skin
hanging on the wall!

484
01:05:51.053 --> 01:05:53.595
- You don't have to hunt him.
- What?

485
01:05:54.679 --> 01:05:55.845
He'll find you.

486
01:05:59.637 --> 01:06:00.804
Are you insane?

487
01:06:02.304 --> 01:06:04.388
One man against trained commandos?

488
01:06:05.763 --> 01:06:09.555
Who do you think this man is? God?

489
01:06:11.514 --> 01:06:14.847
No. God would have mercy. He won't.

490
01:06:28.932 --> 01:06:31.016
It's all right. There's nobody there.

491
01:06:31.099 --> 01:06:33.183
All right. This will hold a while.

492
01:06:34.808 --> 01:06:36.350
What's the fastest way outta here?

493
01:06:37.016 --> 01:06:39.767
Northwest.
There's a trail between mountains

494
01:06:39.850 --> 01:06:43.767
about 3km from here.
The trail is very difficult.

495
01:06:45.517 --> 01:06:48.518
- Now, you take the boy and go.
- I want to stay.

496
01:06:48.684 --> 01:06:49.768
You can't.

497
01:06:52.310 --> 01:06:55.560
You cannot go back there.
We must all go to Pakistan.

498
01:06:55.643 --> 01:06:57.019
No, I gotta go back.

499
01:06:57.685 --> 01:07:00.686
I know he's your friend,
but you can't do this!

500
01:07:01.061 --> 01:07:03.728
You both will die.
For what? Come with us!

501
01:07:03.811 --> 01:07:04.936
Just do what I say.

502
01:07:07.311 --> 01:07:08.478
Let me have your gun.

503
01:07:15.146 --> 01:07:16.437
All right, let's go.

504
01:07:16.687 --> 01:07:17.729
Come on.

505
01:07:35.023 --> 01:07:36.315
I see you again?

506
01:07:37.690 --> 01:07:38.773
Sure.

507
01:13:26.061 --> 01:13:28.061
Come on. Move...

508
01:13:35.729 --> 01:13:36.937
Come on.

509
01:13:48.605 --> 01:13:49.855
Can you fly that thing?

510
01:13:50.230 --> 01:13:51.439
Let's find out.

511
01:14:15.775 --> 01:14:16.858
Let's go!

512
01:14:28.526 --> 01:14:30.068
Hurry... Get on board!

513
01:14:39.402 --> 01:14:40.444
Shit!

514
01:14:44.611 --> 01:14:45.736
Hold on!

515
01:14:56.071 --> 01:14:57.112
Over there!

516
01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:04.363
There!

517
01:15:23.365 --> 01:15:24.490
Hold on!

518
01:15:25.782 --> 01:15:26.907
Get him!

519
01:15:27.241 --> 01:15:28.491
Take my hand!

520
01:15:53.744 --> 01:15:54.910
We're going down!

521
01:16:10.454 --> 01:16:11.579
Hold on!

522
01:16:24.872 --> 01:16:26.580
- Come on, move out.
- Come on, move.

523
01:16:26.664 --> 01:16:27.789
It's gonna blow.

524
01:16:27.872 --> 01:16:29.497
Take what you can, John.

525
01:16:30.122 --> 01:16:31.914
- Come on, move it...
- Go on!

526
01:16:43.624 --> 01:16:44.874
All right, come on.

527
01:16:45.291 --> 01:16:47.458
- We got to get to the border.
- We'll stay here.

528
01:16:47.833 --> 01:16:49.250
We know where to go.

529
01:16:50.041 --> 01:16:52.583
- Which direction, John?
- Northeast.

530
01:16:53.417 --> 01:16:54.625
God willing.

531
01:16:56.167 --> 01:16:57.209
Come on.

532
01:17:40.588 --> 01:17:41.755
Hold it, John.

533
01:17:45.464 --> 01:17:46.923
I gotta rest a minute.

534
01:17:49.256 --> 01:17:50.381
How's the wound?

535
01:17:51.173 --> 01:17:53.173
You taught us to ignore
the pain, didn't ya?

536
01:17:54.007 --> 01:17:55.173
Is it working?

537
01:17:56.340 --> 01:17:57.674
Not really.

538
01:17:59.174 --> 01:18:00.716
Don't take it personally.

539
01:18:02.383 --> 01:18:03.591
Thanks.

540
01:18:24.135 --> 01:18:26.677
You go on ahead
and see if you can find some cover.

541
01:19:12.432 --> 01:19:13.557
John!

542
01:19:28.809 --> 01:19:30.142
John!

543
01:19:39.185 --> 01:19:41.143
That was close, John! How are you?

544
01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:43.560
Well done.

545
01:19:55.145 --> 01:19:57.645
We don't want to make it easy
for them. We'd better split up.

546
01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:01.104
I'm sorry I got you into this, John.

547
01:20:02.021 --> 01:20:03.062
No, you're not.

548
01:21:04.236 --> 01:21:05.319
Are you listening?

549
01:21:06.486 --> 01:21:07.694
Who are you?

550
01:21:08.986 --> 01:21:10.570
Your worst nightmare.

551
01:23:05.082 --> 01:23:06.207
That's good timing.

552
01:23:06.582 --> 01:23:08.082
What are friends for?

553
01:23:09.833 --> 01:23:11.083
You get back to the hole.

554
01:23:11.166 --> 01:23:12.750
I'll cover you,
and see if there's any more left.

555
01:24:13.756 --> 01:24:14.881
John!

556
01:26:30.188 --> 01:26:31.938
Across the valley is the border.

557
01:26:33.938 --> 01:26:35.188
We did it, John!

558
01:26:36.063 --> 01:26:37.188
Yeah.

559
01:26:37.730 --> 01:26:38.814
Wait.

560
01:26:42.731 --> 01:26:44.273
What the hell is that?

561
01:26:48.356 --> 01:26:49.773
The son of a bitch!

562
01:27:16.109 --> 01:27:18.110
<i>Do not try to retreat!</i>

563
01:27:18.776 --> 01:27:20.360
<i>You cannot escape.</i>

564
01:27:20.901 --> 01:27:23.068
<i>We will not attack if you do not run!</i>

565
01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:25.235
<i>We do not want to hurt you.</i>

566
01:27:25.652 --> 01:27:27.027
Somehow I don't believe him.

567
01:27:27.694 --> 01:27:31.694
<i>I order you to come forward,
and you will be given a fair trial.</i>

568
01:27:32.028 --> 01:27:34.736
<i>Drop your weapons,
and remain where you are.</i>

569
01:27:35.028 --> 01:27:36.195
You got any ideas?

570
01:27:37.987 --> 01:27:39.320
<i>Drop your weapons!</i>

571
01:27:40.945 --> 01:27:42.404
Surrounding them's out.

572
01:27:44.154 --> 01:27:45.946
Hell of a time for humor, John.

573
01:27:47.404 --> 01:27:49.863
<i>Drop the weapons! Now!</i>

574
01:27:51.363 --> 01:27:53.280
<i>You have no chance of escape.</i>

575
01:27:53.613 --> 01:27:57.364
<i>Come forward!
I wish to take you back alive.</i>

576
01:27:57.780 --> 01:27:59.822
<i>This is your last warning!</i>

577
01:28:03.073 --> 01:28:04.698
<i>The choice is yours.</i>

578
01:28:05.073 --> 01:28:06.448
What do you say, John?

579
01:28:08.698 --> 01:28:09.865
F**k 'em!

580
01:28:28.951 --> 01:28:31.367
If we're gonna go, I wish we would've
taken that bastard with us!

581
01:29:09.788 --> 01:29:11.247
What is that?

582
01:29:20.706 --> 01:29:21.956
It's the rebels!

583
01:29:34.791 --> 01:29:35.916
Come on!

584
01:30:57.258 --> 01:30:58.300
Come on!

585
01:33:20.607 --> 01:33:21.691
John, get out of there!

586
01:33:30.108 --> 01:33:31.150
John!

587
01:34:57.368 --> 01:35:00.868
You're sure you don't want to stay?
You fight good for a tourist.

588
01:35:03.827 --> 01:35:05.119
Maybe next time.

589
01:35:06.702 --> 01:35:08.119
You want this back?

590
01:35:09.411 --> 01:35:11.744
No. You keep it.

591
01:35:12.619 --> 01:35:14.078
Can you not stay?

592
01:35:28.079 --> 01:35:29.121
I've got to go.

593
01:35:48.957 --> 01:35:51.124
- God willing.
- God willing.

594
01:35:54.291 --> 01:35:56.082
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

595
01:36:03.958 --> 01:36:05.292
Hard to believe, John.

596
01:36:05.667 --> 01:36:06.792
What's that, sir?

597
01:36:07.542 --> 01:36:08.625
Well, I hate to admit it

598
01:36:08.709 --> 01:36:10.709
but the truth is,
I think we're getting soft.

599
01:36:12.793 --> 01:36:14.334
Maybe just a little, sir.

600
01:36:15.335 --> 01:36:16.418
Just a little.
