1
00:02:02.872 --> 00:02:04.123
Moving on up.

2
00:02:04.707 --> 00:02:05.958
Believe that!

3
00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:11.463
-Ladies, we got picture.
-What about the alarm?

4
00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:13.632
Miles, what do you think l'm doing?

5
00:02:13.842 --> 00:02:16.844
Just cool out. We like to run
a loose crew around here.

6
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.470
You're the boss, Miles.

7
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.888
It's like that?

8
00:02:20.056 --> 00:02:21.306
It's like that.

9
00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:24.518
I'm gonna go check on Tulley.

10
00:02:36.072 --> 00:02:38.657
Tulley, we cool down there?

11
00:02:40.493 --> 00:02:42.077
Yeah, we're cool, man.

12
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.412
Good.

13
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.080
Cool is good.

14
00:02:45.582 --> 00:02:46.582
Are you smoking?

15
00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:48.542
No. Negative.

16
00:02:48.918 --> 00:02:52.045
You're lying!
I smell the menthol up here, man!

17
00:02:52.463 --> 00:02:55.966
What would your mama do
if she knew you were smoking?

18
00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:57.843
Cut it out, man!

19
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.763
Stay alert.

20
00:03:02.724 --> 00:03:04.099
You ready over here?

21
00:03:09.772 --> 00:03:12.441
Damn it! Eddie, why you
gotta do that every time?

22
00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:16.612
-lt's good luck.
-lt's bad luck if l land in it. Believe that.

23
00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:18.447
Don't fall in that shit.

24
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.282
See you, Deke.

25
00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:22.201
Good luck, guys.

26
00:03:54.817 --> 00:03:56.401
How's the weather up there?

27
00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:57.736
Snowing.

28
00:03:58.154 --> 00:04:01.240
It's beginning to look
a lot like Christmas.

29
00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:32.813
You got a guard 20 feet from you.

30
00:04:39.362 --> 00:04:40.988
Ten feet.
He's closing in fast.

31
00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:43.365
Around the corner.

32
00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:25.324
He turned around.

33
00:05:27.744 --> 00:05:28.869
Forget it. He's gone.

34
00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:32.914
So much for the easy part. Kit.

35
00:05:34.542 --> 00:05:36.752
-Shit!
-Bam!

36
00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:38.253
I hate it when you do that.

37
00:05:38.671 --> 00:05:39.921
Eddie, check this out.

38
00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:42.883
This is a Brigger 3300.
Toughest safe in the world.

39
00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:44.885
-What do you do?
-Drill the lock.

40
00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:47.596
No, you gotta check
to see if it's open.

41
00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:49.473
It's open!

42
00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:51.475
What?

43
00:05:51.934 --> 00:05:54.936
No, I'm messing with you.
They would never do that.

44
00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:57.022
They would never do that.

45
00:06:28.763 --> 00:06:29.805
Glasses.

46
00:06:35.603 --> 00:06:37.813
-l'll see you back up top.
-Right.

47
00:07:11.347 --> 00:07:12.848
Open sesame.

48
00:07:15.476 --> 00:07:16.518
Come on, Eddie.

49
00:07:17.353 --> 00:07:19.813
-Got the rock?
-Miles is right behind me.

50
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.773
Eddie.

51
00:07:24.193 --> 00:07:25.444
What the hell you doing?

52
00:07:25.653 --> 00:07:27.696
Seventeen million four ways?

53
00:07:28.156 --> 00:07:29.698
I'm too greedy for that.

54
00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:30.991
No, just come on, man!

55
00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:42.586
Shit!

56
00:07:58.769 --> 00:08:00.562
Come here, gorgeous.

57
00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:05.734
Got the rock. Time to roll.

58
00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:07.235
Hurry! There's lots...

59
00:08:07.403 --> 00:08:09.196
...of activity here. Let's go!

60
00:08:09.405 --> 00:08:10.405
Shit!

61
00:08:38.726 --> 00:08:39.768
Freeze!

62
00:08:47.944 --> 00:08:48.944
Clear!

63
00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:53.114
Let's go!

64
00:08:53.324 --> 00:08:56.576
-Stay down! Don't move!
-Let me see your hands!

65
00:08:56.953 --> 00:08:58.203
Hey, Miles.

66
00:08:58.454 --> 00:09:00.372
-Where's Eddie?
-He went over already.

67
00:09:00.581 --> 00:09:01.790
-You have the rock?
-What?

68
00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:02.999
You got the rock?

69
00:09:03.167 --> 00:09:04.793
-What you doing?
-Give me the rock!

70
00:09:04.961 --> 00:09:06.753
You ain't got to do this!

71
00:09:06.963 --> 00:09:10.590
We're supposed to split this shit, man!
Why you doing this?

72
00:09:44.166 --> 00:09:45.208
Shit!

73
00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:04.144
Miles, you're dead,
you piece of shit!

74
00:11:10.878 --> 00:11:11.920
Damn!

75
00:11:44.412 --> 00:11:47.372
Good doggie!

76
00:11:47.581 --> 00:11:49.791
Kibbles 'n Bits! Easy.

77
00:11:50.292 --> 00:11:52.001
Where's the nearest exit?

78
00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:54.045
Stay where you are!

79
00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:55.422
Turn around!

80
00:11:55.589 --> 00:11:58.633
I'm a carpenter! I was working late!

81
00:12:00.052 --> 00:12:03.263
See? That's the saw!
See? I was working!

82
00:12:03.472 --> 00:12:06.141
You're under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent.

83
00:12:06.392 --> 00:12:09.310
Anything you say can and will
be used against you.

84
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.148
If you can't afford an attorney,
one will be appointed for you.

85
00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:14.816
Do you understand your rights?

86
00:12:16.777 --> 00:12:18.820
Yeah, l understand them.

87
00:12:53.355 --> 00:12:55.064
Ain't nothing but a free thing, baby!

88
00:12:57.651 --> 00:12:59.527
Free man. Believe that.

89
00:13:00.571 --> 00:13:02.071
One belt, one shoelace...

90
00:13:02.281 --> 00:13:04.365
...one wallet containing $22.

91
00:13:04.658 --> 00:13:05.992
One shoelace?

92
00:13:06.327 --> 00:13:09.370
You know how much them shoes cost?
One shoelace?

93
00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:11.372
I came in here with two.

94
00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:15.210
You took my shoelace?
Did you take my shoelace, man?

95
00:13:16.128 --> 00:13:18.671
You got two seconds
to walk out that door.

96
00:13:18.881 --> 00:13:19.923
Sign out...

97
00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:21.716
...and leave my pen.

98
00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:24.469
I'm signing out.

99
00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:27.180
I got places to go, people to see.

100
00:13:27.473 --> 00:13:29.182
My lady, Janiece.

101
00:13:29.517 --> 00:13:30.725
Ass....

102
00:13:32.102 --> 00:13:33.311
It's like that.

103
00:13:33.521 --> 00:13:37.232
What you gonna do with
one shoelace? Let me in on the secret.

104
00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:39.359
Floss your ass?

105
00:13:40.027 --> 00:13:41.194
Gotta go.

106
00:13:44.406 --> 00:13:47.200
Y'all stay up, man.
Don't be mad because I gotta go.

107
00:13:47.493 --> 00:13:51.120
Come on, open this fence.
Thanks. I'm out of here.

108
00:13:53.165 --> 00:13:56.084
Where them butt-naked hoes at?
Do you know?

109
00:13:57.002 --> 00:13:58.419
Let me up out of here.

110
00:14:02.132 --> 00:14:04.717
I'm free! l'm free at last!

111
00:14:05.386 --> 00:14:07.846
Gotta go! Gotta go, gotta go!

112
00:14:10.015 --> 00:14:11.349
I'm out of here!

113
00:14:34.957 --> 00:14:36.249
Damn!

114
00:14:36.458 --> 00:14:38.084
What happened?

115
00:14:38.794 --> 00:14:40.962
Did you eat the whole time
I was in there?

116
00:14:41.171 --> 00:14:43.965
When I left, you was like:

117
00:14:44.383 --> 00:14:46.050
Now, you're like:

118
00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.387
Wait a minute. That's all right.
I can adjust.

119
00:14:49.597 --> 00:14:53.308
It's the love that counts.
I can adjust to a plus-size woman.

120
00:14:53.475 --> 00:14:56.477
Just more cushion for the pushing.

121
00:14:56.979 --> 00:14:58.313
Janiece!

122
00:14:58.647 --> 00:15:01.190
Your sad-ass sack of bones is here.

123
00:15:01.984 --> 00:15:04.402
I apologise. You're her cousin.

124
00:15:04.987 --> 00:15:06.321
Can l buy you some cereal?

125
00:15:06.572 --> 00:15:07.947
It's okay, Shawna.

126
00:15:08.574 --> 00:15:11.910
There you are. Just hot!

127
00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:16.956
Baby, you are....

128
00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.292
You look beautiful.

129
00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:23.630
You are beautiful. And that's
not two years of prison talking.

130
00:15:23.839 --> 00:15:26.507
Baby, it must've been hard
in there for you.

131
00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:30.136
All alone at night in your little cot.

132
00:15:30.471 --> 00:15:32.013
Tell me something, Miles.

133
00:15:32.973 --> 00:15:34.599
Did you think about me?

134
00:15:35.768 --> 00:15:37.810
Think about you all the time.

135
00:15:38.145 --> 00:15:40.188
Think about you right now.

136
00:15:40.773 --> 00:15:44.317
Then you should've thought about that
before you robbed people!

137
00:15:46.195 --> 00:15:48.029
I never robbed you!

138
00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:51.783
I'm a rehabilitated man!

139
00:15:56.622 --> 00:15:57.830
Talk to me.

140
00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:01.209
I didn't come see you for two years.
Wasn't that a sign?

141
00:16:01.877 --> 00:16:04.045
You couldn't stand
to see your man like that.

142
00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:09.509
Man? You're not my man. You lie.
You told me you were a banker.

143
00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.345
Bank robber. Yeah, see,
sometime l stutter.

144
00:16:12.554 --> 00:16:15.556
But l'm getting that whole
speech impediment thing--

145
00:16:16.058 --> 00:16:20.812
You are a very smart man, but the time
we spent together was one big lie.

146
00:16:21.313 --> 00:16:23.898
Look, Janiece. Listen to me, okay?

147
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.068
I know l lied about some things,
but I can change.

148
00:16:27.319 --> 00:16:28.403
I don't think so.

149
00:16:28.696 --> 00:16:32.281
-Bye!
-Don't do me like this!

150
00:16:49.591 --> 00:16:51.426
Fifth and Grand?

151
00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:09.569
How you doing?
Is this really a police station?

152
00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:11.112
Of course.

153
00:17:51.236 --> 00:17:53.738
Hi. l have a delivery for Traffic.

154
00:17:54.865 --> 00:17:56.157
Sign by the X.

155
00:17:58.619 --> 00:18:02.830
What have we got?
Egg roll, orange chicken....

156
00:18:03.248 --> 00:18:05.083
Hot pizza coming through. Hot pizza!

157
00:18:05.375 --> 00:18:07.418
Got to get the officers
their pizza.

158
00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:11.589
They got to protect and serve.
The police got to eat too!

159
00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:13.341
Let the officers eat, please.

160
00:18:13.592 --> 00:18:16.969
I'm the pizza man here
to deliver the pizza. Thank you.

161
00:18:17.179 --> 00:18:19.097
Officers, l got your pizzas!

162
00:18:20.682 --> 00:18:23.976
"Third Floor: Robbery-Homicide."

163
00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.856
Yeah, please be careful.
Pizza's very hot.

164
00:18:29.024 --> 00:18:32.777
Don't want nobody to get hurt.
Just got here some pizza for you.

165
00:18:32.986 --> 00:18:35.822
Pizza for you. That's how we do it
down at the pizza place.

166
00:18:36.448 --> 00:18:38.491
Watch it, watch it, watch it!

167
00:18:39.535 --> 00:18:42.829
Two time, bring it up!
Don't drop the pizza!

168
00:18:49.044 --> 00:18:51.462
Pizza delivery for Robbery-Homicide.

169
00:18:51.964 --> 00:18:53.840
Robbery-Homicide?

170
00:18:54.383 --> 00:18:56.926
Why is it l don't see
Robbery-Homicide...

171
00:18:57.136 --> 00:18:59.387
...with a pizza delivery
in the log-in sheet?

172
00:18:59.638 --> 00:19:03.057
I'll tell you what. Why don't you
leave that pizza with me?

173
00:19:03.225 --> 00:19:06.519
No, I'll tell you what.
Last time l left a pizza here...

174
00:19:06.728 --> 00:19:08.437
...it magically disappeared.

175
00:19:08.689 --> 00:19:11.440
I mean, it's just like
leaving candy around me.

176
00:19:11.692 --> 00:19:15.403
It's not gonna be all right.
I'm gonna chomp it up. See?

177
00:19:15.737 --> 00:19:17.989
Two kinds of people
get through that door:

178
00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.867
People wearing handcuffs.
People wearing a badge.

179
00:19:21.076 --> 00:19:22.827
You don't have on either.

180
00:19:24.454 --> 00:19:27.748
Well, l don't have
a badge or handcuffs, so....

181
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.041
Officer Carlson.

182
00:19:29.251 --> 00:19:33.212
-We wanna flip that card right over.
-Sorry. Just got it.

183
00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:35.256
Excuse me, officer.

184
00:19:36.758 --> 00:19:40.428
The guys in Homicide ordered
this pizza about an hour ago.

185
00:19:42.681 --> 00:19:45.266
I don't wanna leave them
with Shamu over there.

186
00:19:47.102 --> 00:19:49.604
-What do you want me to do?
-Take them!

187
00:19:49.771 --> 00:19:52.190
-l'm on duty. I can't do that.
-Yes, you can!

188
00:19:52.399 --> 00:19:54.275
Please take that!

189
00:19:56.111 --> 00:19:57.778
Thank you very much!

190
00:20:01.074 --> 00:20:02.700
Break it down.

191
00:20:05.204 --> 00:20:06.787
Two time, left!

192
00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:09.207
One time! Break it down to the ground!

193
00:20:09.541 --> 00:20:10.583
Go here!

194
00:20:10.751 --> 00:20:13.085
Left leg! Bring it around!

195
00:20:14.796 --> 00:20:16.214
Walk!

196
00:20:23.805 --> 00:20:25.806
You hid a diamond
in the police station?

197
00:20:26.058 --> 00:20:29.560
I didn't know it was a police station.
Can you change the I.D. or not?

198
00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:33.981
Sure, but won't they be suspicious of
a pizza man with a security clearance?

199
00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:36.317
I'm not going back as a pizza man.

200
00:20:36.568 --> 00:20:37.652
What are you going as?

201
00:20:37.903 --> 00:20:40.071
-A cop.
-A cop?

202
00:20:40.322 --> 00:20:41.364
A new transfer.

203
00:20:41.531 --> 00:20:45.159
That's why I need that ID
and a new file for detective.

204
00:20:45.786 --> 00:20:46.827
Why a detective?

205
00:20:47.037 --> 00:20:48.913
That's where the rock is.

206
00:20:51.792 --> 00:20:53.334
It's gonna be expensive.

207
00:20:54.169 --> 00:20:56.671
Uncle Lou,
I thought we was like family.

208
00:20:56.964 --> 00:20:59.632
Yeah, well, "like family" is not family.

209
00:20:59.841 --> 00:21:03.177
If you were family,
you'd want it for free, right?

210
00:21:04.846 --> 00:21:07.682
Well, you ain't changed.
I'll see you later.

211
00:21:20.028 --> 00:21:21.320
Get down!

212
00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:23.948
Put some clothes on!
Get your butt-naked ass down!

213
00:21:24.199 --> 00:21:25.992
Get your butt-naked ass down!

214
00:21:26.201 --> 00:21:29.578
He's naked and he's stinking.
Somebody get him some clothes.

215
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:31.580
He's hiding a gun in his ass!

216
00:21:34.042 --> 00:21:36.210
Get on the ground. Do it now.

217
00:21:36.461 --> 00:21:37.545
Don't l know you?

218
00:21:38.547 --> 00:21:40.631
Freeze! Cuff him!

219
00:21:40.799 --> 00:21:42.466
Yeah, cuff his ass.

220
00:21:42.676 --> 00:21:44.593
I'm gonna cuff you like that.

221
00:21:44.845 --> 00:21:47.972
I'm the good cop.
You act up, I'll turn into the bad one.

222
00:21:53.687 --> 00:21:55.354
Freeze! Get them up!

223
00:21:55.564 --> 00:21:57.189
Spread your legs now.

224
00:21:57.524 --> 00:21:59.817
I'm an officer of the law.

225
00:22:02.988 --> 00:22:04.196
Any sign of Deacon?

226
00:22:04.489 --> 00:22:07.658
Last l heard, he was pulling
rip jobs in Carson.

227
00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:11.662
-l warned you about that guy.
-That you did.

228
00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:12.872
He'll know you're out.

229
00:22:15.167 --> 00:22:17.376
This is purely cosmetic.
It won't check out.

230
00:22:17.586 --> 00:22:21.130
Don't worry. l'll be out of there
in an hour, max. Thanks.

231
00:22:21.298 --> 00:22:22.340
Good luck.

232
00:22:39.399 --> 00:22:41.942
Hey there, officer dog.

233
00:22:42.402 --> 00:22:44.487
-l'm a detective.
-Sorry, sir.

234
00:22:44.738 --> 00:22:45.863
She's never done that.

235
00:22:46.573 --> 00:22:48.366
Must be the pastrami.

236
00:22:48.784 --> 00:22:49.784
Bitch!

237
00:22:57.876 --> 00:22:58.918
Are you going up?

238
00:23:01.421 --> 00:23:02.671
Up. Third floor.

239
00:23:04.758 --> 00:23:06.300
Appreciate it.

240
00:23:21.316 --> 00:23:23.818
What?

241
00:23:49.261 --> 00:23:53.013
The vehicle belonged to your friend,
but you don't remember his name?

242
00:23:53.932 --> 00:23:55.307
Do you have a last name?

243
00:23:56.017 --> 00:23:58.477
Damn, these cuffs are tight, man!

244
00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:03.023
Miss Green, could you tell
this man to loosen these cuffs?

245
00:24:11.825 --> 00:24:14.160
I can't feel my fingers, man.
I'm serious. Please?

246
00:24:14.369 --> 00:24:16.036
-l know it.
-Detective.

247
00:24:16.663 --> 00:24:18.122
Not so tight.

248
00:24:19.374 --> 00:24:21.333
Maybe I could loosen them up a bit.

249
00:24:21.501 --> 00:24:23.335
-Okay.
-Thank you.

250
00:24:37.559 --> 00:24:40.644
You got a great lawyer there.
Top of the line. Here you go.

251
00:25:00.248 --> 00:25:01.415
He's in here!

252
00:25:05.253 --> 00:25:06.295
Jesus!

253
00:25:07.255 --> 00:25:08.297
How y'all doing?

254
00:25:08.924 --> 00:25:10.424
Not again, Carlson!

255
00:25:10.675 --> 00:25:12.343
The guy body-slammed me, sir.

256
00:25:12.594 --> 00:25:13.594
Maybe he likes you.

257
00:25:13.845 --> 00:25:15.012
He did what to you?

258
00:25:15.263 --> 00:25:19.016
Get him out of here! What were
you thinking? Man, that's not smart!

259
00:25:19.351 --> 00:25:20.684
Get him out of here.

260
00:25:23.396 --> 00:25:25.022
What the hell happened up there?

261
00:25:26.024 --> 00:25:27.191
Up here?

262
00:25:28.443 --> 00:25:30.819
I caught him trying to escape.

263
00:25:31.696 --> 00:25:33.113
Who the hell are you?

264
00:25:34.616 --> 00:25:36.867
Malone. Just transferred.
Right there.

265
00:25:37.077 --> 00:25:39.036
Yeah, check that out. Bam!

266
00:25:39.246 --> 00:25:40.454
-You know Malone?
-No.

267
00:25:40.622 --> 00:25:42.122
Nobody told me about it.

268
00:25:43.542 --> 00:25:44.750
Guys....

269
00:25:46.545 --> 00:25:49.421
-Sorry, ma'am.
-Excuse me.

270
00:25:51.132 --> 00:25:53.050
Let me flush, please.

271
00:25:56.471 --> 00:26:00.057
I didn't know.
You might not wanna go in there.

272
00:26:02.352 --> 00:26:04.853
You got some paperwork for me,
Malone?

273
00:26:05.981 --> 00:26:08.983
We've been requesting
a new detective for 8 months.

274
00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:13.279
Suddenly, you just turn up.
I'll never understand the system.

275
00:26:14.322 --> 00:26:17.783
Burglary? Sixteen citations,
mayor's commendation.

276
00:26:18.451 --> 00:26:20.661
You worked out of West Covina?

277
00:26:21.079 --> 00:26:22.997
Well, that's what it says right there.

278
00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:26.458
You look familiar, Malone.
Have we met before?

279
00:26:29.921 --> 00:26:32.798
You wouldn't happen to be
in a bowling league, would you?

280
00:26:34.968 --> 00:26:37.511
That's it. You're a bowler.

281
00:26:37.762 --> 00:26:40.514
-l try.
-We could use a guy in Burglary.

282
00:26:42.517 --> 00:26:43.892
Right here.

283
00:26:44.144 --> 00:26:48.647
I thought I was gonna be assigned
to a desk. Right up in here!

284
00:26:48.857 --> 00:26:49.982
Are you kidding me?

285
00:26:50.191 --> 00:26:53.319
A guy like you?
No, you belong on the street.

286
00:26:53.862 --> 00:26:54.862
And also, listen.

287
00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:58.907
Carlson needs a partner with some
experience. He just got promoted.

288
00:26:59.409 --> 00:27:00.909
Chief, I just got a call.

289
00:27:01.119 --> 00:27:03.704
Malone's gonna join us.
Show him around.

290
00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:08.042
And let Malone do
all the handcuffing, okay?

291
00:27:09.669 --> 00:27:11.045
I appreciate that, yeah.

292
00:27:11.671 --> 00:27:12.713
I'll review these.

293
00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:18.052
This is the bullpen here.
That's Booking up there.

294
00:27:18.303 --> 00:27:21.388
The holding cells are down that way.
You wanna see them?

295
00:27:21.681 --> 00:27:23.682
Seen one, seen them all.

296
00:27:24.225 --> 00:27:25.643
This is my desk here, sir.

297
00:27:25.852 --> 00:27:27.227
Nice desk.

298
00:27:27.437 --> 00:27:29.563
Thanks. Let's see....

299
00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:31.315
Brass is on five.

300
00:27:31.524 --> 00:27:32.858
Robbery-Homicide on three.

301
00:27:33.068 --> 00:27:35.069
Over there, that's the tag and bag.

302
00:27:36.446 --> 00:27:39.073
-Through those doors, that's 1 0-1 7.
-Roger.

303
00:27:40.492 --> 00:27:41.825
Show him the rest later.

304
00:27:42.035 --> 00:27:43.577
-Come on.
-Where?

305
00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:46.580
We got a call. Burglary.
It's ours. I'll take this.

306
00:27:46.831 --> 00:27:49.541
-Outside?
-That's where all the crime is.

307
00:27:49.751 --> 00:27:51.919
I just got here,
and that's not a good thing.

308
00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:55.589
I gotta do work in here so that
I know what's going on out there.

309
00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.466
I might need backup, right?

310
00:28:00.053 --> 00:28:01.762
How long you been in Burglary?

311
00:28:02.013 --> 00:28:04.598
Me? All my life, man, all my life.

312
00:28:04.849 --> 00:28:09.978
I heard the chief say that you got 1 6
citations. That's incredible. Sixteen.

313
00:28:10.271 --> 00:28:13.524
That's what happens when
your Uncle Lou writes your file.

314
00:28:16.695 --> 00:28:19.113
You can ride up front if you want.

315
00:28:20.865 --> 00:28:22.116
I knew that.

316
00:28:22.534 --> 00:28:26.078
You just gotta be real careful
for the pedestrians coming out here.

317
00:28:26.287 --> 00:28:27.955
Walking around out here.

318
00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:32.292
Am l clear to the right?
Am l clear? Have I got it?

319
00:28:35.296 --> 00:28:36.588
I just made detective.

320
00:28:36.798 --> 00:28:37.923
No kidding.

321
00:28:39.259 --> 00:28:42.803
I worked Traffic for three years.
I got pretty good at it.

322
00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:50.310
You don't have to stop for the yellow.
You could just drive right through.

323
00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:55.482
Sir, not if you'd seen some
of the accidents l've seen. No thanks.

324
00:28:56.276 --> 00:28:58.569
Well, there's your green right there.

325
00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:04.116
Can l ask you a personal question?

326
00:29:04.325 --> 00:29:06.034
Yeah, sure.

327
00:29:06.661 --> 00:29:08.620
How many times did you take the test?

328
00:29:09.914 --> 00:29:13.792
-What test?
-You know, the test for detective.

329
00:29:14.335 --> 00:29:15.461
That one!

330
00:29:15.754 --> 00:29:17.129
-One time.
-Really?

331
00:29:17.589 --> 00:29:19.006
Aced it.

332
00:29:19.841 --> 00:29:21.341
Took it out.

333
00:29:21.551 --> 00:29:23.802
Took me five tries.

334
00:29:24.304 --> 00:29:28.307
I did well on the written part, but my
performance reviews weren't so hot.

335
00:29:28.516 --> 00:29:32.186
How many times did it take you
to get your driver's licence, man?

336
00:29:32.353 --> 00:29:35.147
Please!
Wake me up when we get there.

337
00:29:35.356 --> 00:29:37.107
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

338
00:29:37.317 --> 00:29:39.193
Goodness, man!

339
00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:42.654
It's a nice suit, sir.
It's really cool.

340
00:29:42.864 --> 00:29:44.531
Well, l appreciate it.

341
00:29:44.699 --> 00:29:46.700
Yeah, you know? Appreciate it.

342
00:29:46.993 --> 00:29:49.620
-Got any music?
-Oh, yeah. Sure.

343
00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:51.872
I like to jam.

344
00:29:52.123 --> 00:29:54.833
Just so long as
we can hear the dispatcher.

345
00:29:56.211 --> 00:29:57.628
That's good.

346
00:29:58.379 --> 00:30:02.382
-l never heard this station before.
-Kind of funky. You like that?

347
00:30:14.062 --> 00:30:17.523
Last night these shelves were loaded
with Elites. Now they're gone.

348
00:30:17.899 --> 00:30:19.399
Three dozen gorgeous rims.

349
00:30:19.651 --> 00:30:21.193
They didn't take anything else?

350
00:30:21.402 --> 00:30:25.531
They went for my good stuff. Chrome
with gold trim. Five grand worth.

351
00:30:26.533 --> 00:30:27.658
What about the alarm?

352
00:30:27.867 --> 00:30:29.743
What about it? It went off.

353
00:30:29.911 --> 00:30:32.079
But it took you guys
two hours to get here.

354
00:30:32.247 --> 00:30:34.498
My wheels are probably
in Tijuana by now.

355
00:30:34.707 --> 00:30:36.250
Here's where they came in.

356
00:30:37.585 --> 00:30:40.587
Looks like they broke the glass,
opened the handle...

357
00:30:40.755 --> 00:30:42.089
...crawled in the window.

358
00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:43.382
Exactly.

359
00:30:43.591 --> 00:30:45.509
Shimmied down the shelf
or something.

360
00:30:45.718 --> 00:30:46.927
This is a waste of time.

361
00:30:47.136 --> 00:30:48.762
That's not how they got in.

362
00:30:49.264 --> 00:30:50.556
Of course it is.

363
00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:52.891
Cut it out.
That's not how they got in.

364
00:30:53.142 --> 00:30:54.268
This is the spot here.

365
00:30:54.435 --> 00:30:56.270
That's how l would've came in.

366
00:30:56.938 --> 00:30:58.772
If l was a thief.

367
00:30:59.023 --> 00:31:00.774
If l was a thief!

368
00:31:00.942 --> 00:31:03.944
Skylight. Just cut the alarm
from the inside.

369
00:31:04.153 --> 00:31:05.946
I could take my time.

370
00:31:06.155 --> 00:31:07.197
Why take your time?

371
00:31:07.699 --> 00:31:09.241
Why would l take my time?

372
00:31:14.038 --> 00:31:15.372
It's heavy.

373
00:31:16.291 --> 00:31:17.791
Now, you tell me.

374
00:31:17.959 --> 00:31:22.754
How long would it take to carry
3 dozen out and load them in a truck?

375
00:31:22.964 --> 00:31:25.757
-Long time.
-lt would take a very long time.

376
00:31:25.967 --> 00:31:29.428
But they probably had three
or four guys working the damn thing--

377
00:31:29.637 --> 00:31:31.972
Zip! Zip the shit up! Frank, hush.

378
00:31:32.307 --> 00:31:34.474
Because you know better. Come on.

379
00:31:34.726 --> 00:31:38.604
Don't lie to me. l'm the man.
I'm the man, Frank.

380
00:31:38.813 --> 00:31:40.230
You're the man.

381
00:31:40.815 --> 00:31:45.319
Your 5000, sorry to tell you,
is worth less than two on the street.

382
00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:48.906
Which don't go four ways
with much juice once you rent a truck.

383
00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:53.201
And to rent a truck,
that requires what?

384
00:31:53.995 --> 00:31:55.495
Credit card...

385
00:31:56.205 --> 00:31:58.332
...driver's licence.

386
00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:00.834
Unless, of course...

387
00:32:01.836 --> 00:32:03.337
...you got your own truck.

388
00:32:05.423 --> 00:32:07.466
He's not gonna let us
search his truck.

389
00:32:07.675 --> 00:32:10.510
What you mean, "let us"?
We the police.

390
00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:12.512
We need a warrant to do that.

391
00:32:12.764 --> 00:32:14.806
We don't even need a key.

392
00:32:16.768 --> 00:32:19.478
Detective, you can't do that.
It's unconstitutional.

393
00:32:20.271 --> 00:32:23.440
Look at that. Look at this.

394
00:32:27.153 --> 00:32:31.114
Look. Solved the crime
my first day on the job!

395
00:32:31.324 --> 00:32:33.825
-We bad detectives.
-There they are!

396
00:32:33.993 --> 00:32:37.871
Filing a false report
is a very serious crime.

397
00:32:41.042 --> 00:32:44.628
I'll handle this. Bring your
weeble-wobble ass over here.

398
00:32:46.881 --> 00:32:49.633
-You like snacks?
-Nothing makes me happier.

399
00:32:49.842 --> 00:32:53.470
You'll be snacking on the bottom
of this shoe if this happens again.

400
00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:55.222
Now, you see them ridges?

401
00:32:55.390 --> 00:32:58.392
These ridges will be imprinted
on the back of your ass...

402
00:32:58.685 --> 00:33:01.144
...permanently if this happens again.

403
00:33:01.354 --> 00:33:02.396
You understand?

404
00:33:02.563 --> 00:33:03.772
Thoroughly understand you.

405
00:33:03.982 --> 00:33:07.818
Every time you look at your ass
there's gonna be a print there.

406
00:33:08.027 --> 00:33:09.820
It's gonna remind you of us.

407
00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:12.155
-And of you lying.
-Right.

408
00:33:12.657 --> 00:33:14.074
Don't wanna see those ridges.

409
00:33:14.367 --> 00:33:18.787
Stop eating cold cuts because
it's seeping through your pores.

410
00:33:18.997 --> 00:33:20.163
Will do.

411
00:33:20.415 --> 00:33:23.000
I'll put one ridge on your ass.

412
00:33:23.501 --> 00:33:26.920
Let's roll. That's cool.
Let's get out of here.

413
00:33:29.215 --> 00:33:31.383
Detective, l know l'm new at this...

414
00:33:31.592 --> 00:33:34.428
...but l thought we were supposed
to arrest the bad guys.

415
00:33:34.721 --> 00:33:36.555
Now he owes us one.

416
00:33:36.764 --> 00:33:38.098
So that's how it works.

417
00:33:38.516 --> 00:33:42.436
We let the little fish go, so that
we can catch the big fish later.

418
00:33:42.687 --> 00:33:44.104
I got it. I got it.

419
00:33:47.358 --> 00:33:50.444
You mind if l drive?
I know a shortcut.

420
00:33:54.741 --> 00:33:56.074
You might wanna buckle up.

421
00:34:04.584 --> 00:34:07.252
Are you in a hurry, sir?

422
00:34:07.462 --> 00:34:10.547
Just testing your car.
Balancing out your shit.

423
00:34:12.884 --> 00:34:15.385
When was the last time
you got all up on this thing?

424
00:34:15.636 --> 00:34:18.055
I've never gotten all up
on anything, sir.

425
00:34:19.265 --> 00:34:22.476
Sometimes you gotta feed
some speed to your ride.

426
00:34:25.146 --> 00:34:26.730
Sir! Watch it!

427
00:34:30.985 --> 00:34:33.904
This is the police!
Move your busted-ass vehicle!

428
00:34:34.405 --> 00:34:36.281
Move, move, move, move, move!

429
00:34:36.491 --> 00:34:38.075
This is the LAPD.

430
00:34:38.284 --> 00:34:39.785
We'll pop one in your ass.

431
00:34:39.994 --> 00:34:41.912
We got guns and shit.

432
00:34:43.289 --> 00:34:44.623
I could get used to this!

433
00:34:45.333 --> 00:34:47.876
I like! l like!

434
00:34:48.086 --> 00:34:49.252
Used to what?

435
00:34:52.173 --> 00:34:55.634
Driving. See, my last partner
did all the driving.

436
00:34:56.177 --> 00:34:57.886
Who was your partner?

437
00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:01.139
I don't wanna talk about it.

438
00:35:01.641 --> 00:35:02.682
Why?

439
00:35:03.101 --> 00:35:07.813
Hey, look, l'm deep, okay? There's
just some places l can't talk about.

440
00:35:08.022 --> 00:35:11.691
We're partners. Gotta communicate.
This thing's like a marriage.

441
00:35:11.943 --> 00:35:14.194
No, this is nothing like a marriage.

442
00:35:14.695 --> 00:35:17.489
-What is it like?
-lt's more like a one-night stand.

443
00:35:17.698 --> 00:35:20.450
Wham, bam, thank you, officer.

444
00:35:25.039 --> 00:35:27.207
-lt's like that?
-lt's like that.

445
00:35:27.708 --> 00:35:31.211
We're just gonna fight crime
and zip the rest of that shit up.

446
00:35:31.462 --> 00:35:32.879
Are you married?

447
00:35:33.131 --> 00:35:34.548
-Girlfriend?
-Not anymore.

448
00:35:34.799 --> 00:35:35.841
What happened?

449
00:35:38.219 --> 00:35:40.011
Work got in the way.

450
00:35:41.055 --> 00:35:42.180
See?

451
00:35:47.353 --> 00:35:49.229
Somebody took out a fire hydrant.

452
00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:58.822
-l'll handle this.
-l gotta get back. I got a headache.

453
00:35:59.031 --> 00:36:00.866
We're on duty.

454
00:36:01.075 --> 00:36:05.078
But l need an aspirin.
A big one, like a hockey puck.

455
00:36:05.246 --> 00:36:06.746
Gentlemen. Excuse me.

456
00:36:06.998 --> 00:36:08.999
Could you come here for a second?

457
00:36:09.584 --> 00:36:11.710
Relax, sir.
Just take it easy for a second.

458
00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:21.094
Morning, officer.

459
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:26.099
Morning. Where's your aspirins?

460
00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:28.226
Back there by the soda machines.

461
00:36:28.603 --> 00:36:29.603
Appreciate it.

462
00:36:39.864 --> 00:36:42.240
I wanna know how the car
hit the fire hydrant.

463
00:36:44.118 --> 00:36:46.036
-Open the register!
-Don't shoot!

464
00:36:46.287 --> 00:36:47.287
Come on, man!

465
00:36:47.622 --> 00:36:50.040
-Oh, man!
-Come on! The safe too!

466
00:36:58.466 --> 00:36:59.466
Come on.

467
00:37:05.514 --> 00:37:09.309
37-King-5.
Shots fired. Request help.

468
00:37:09.518 --> 00:37:12.062
41 8 West Fifth Street.

469
00:37:19.237 --> 00:37:20.278
Detective Malone!

470
00:37:20.488 --> 00:37:21.571
You okay?

471
00:37:21.822 --> 00:37:22.822
Oh, shit!

472
00:37:25.618 --> 00:37:27.911
Get back! Back! Get back!

473
00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:29.162
Time out, time out.

474
00:37:30.498 --> 00:37:31.665
All right, l'm leaving.

475
00:37:32.166 --> 00:37:33.667
Freeze!

476
00:37:33.918 --> 00:37:36.044
Put your hands on the pavement!

477
00:37:36.254 --> 00:37:38.838
-Hands on the pavement!
-There is no pavement!

478
00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:41.341
Put them on the Oodles of Noodles.

479
00:37:41.592 --> 00:37:43.593
-Put them on the noodles.
-Chicken or beef?

480
00:37:43.803 --> 00:37:44.844
Chicken.

481
00:37:46.305 --> 00:37:49.015
Cool. Cool is good.

482
00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:50.892
Miles?

483
00:37:51.269 --> 00:37:52.310
Tulley?

484
00:37:57.066 --> 00:37:58.108
What are you doing?

485
00:37:58.276 --> 00:38:00.527
What am I doing?
What are you doing?

486
00:38:00.778 --> 00:38:02.696
I'm freaking working over here.

487
00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:05.949
I'm coming in!

488
00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:09.286
Put the gun down!

489
00:38:09.495 --> 00:38:10.996
Detective Malone, talk to me!

490
00:38:11.205 --> 00:38:12.872
Go out the back way!

491
00:38:13.124 --> 00:38:14.874
Go! The back way!

492
00:38:15.209 --> 00:38:16.876
Go out the back way!

493
00:38:17.795 --> 00:38:18.837
Detective, talk to me!

494
00:38:20.673 --> 00:38:21.881
Take two steps back!

495
00:38:23.509 --> 00:38:24.592
What the hell? Go!

496
00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:27.220
Hold it!

497
00:38:29.724 --> 00:38:30.807
Hold your fire!

498
00:38:34.186 --> 00:38:35.729
You okay?

499
00:39:00.379 --> 00:39:01.588
Listen, it's a dead end!

500
00:39:01.839 --> 00:39:03.506
No shit!

501
00:39:08.637 --> 00:39:12.182
He's behind those dumpsters.
He's freaking out. He's got a gun.

502
00:39:15.186 --> 00:39:16.227
Back up!

503
00:39:17.438 --> 00:39:20.440
Get SWAT up here! Sharpshooters
can take him off from the roof.

504
00:39:20.608 --> 00:39:21.900
No!

505
00:39:22.068 --> 00:39:23.610
No sharpshooters.

506
00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:25.111
Why the hell not?

507
00:39:26.864 --> 00:39:28.365
What are you doing here, man?

508
00:39:28.699 --> 00:39:30.700
-Who's he talking to?
-l don't know.

509
00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:34.162
He high, man. He's hallucinating.
Smoking that shit!

510
00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:36.289
He's high.

511
00:39:36.957 --> 00:39:38.708
Put down the gun and come out!

512
00:39:41.754 --> 00:39:43.797
Hold this. Hold on. l'm going in.

513
00:39:44.131 --> 00:39:45.131
What are you doing?

514
00:39:45.758 --> 00:39:47.133
What, are you crazy?

515
00:39:49.595 --> 00:39:51.304
Miles, what are you doing here?

516
00:39:51.764 --> 00:39:54.641
I just wanna talk to you
before somebody gets hurt!

517
00:39:54.934 --> 00:39:56.643
Please put down the gun!

518
00:39:56.894 --> 00:39:58.561
-Son, come on.
-Shut up!

519
00:39:58.771 --> 00:39:59.979
It hurts my heart...

520
00:40:00.231 --> 00:40:02.899
...to see a kid that has
so much potential.

521
00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:05.276
-You're smarter than that.
-l'm coming out!

522
00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:10.073
Listen. All right, now, goddamn it!
What are you doing?

523
00:40:10.324 --> 00:40:13.451
What are you doing?
You got me out here in this shit.

524
00:40:13.661 --> 00:40:15.745
How many times l told you...

525
00:40:15.996 --> 00:40:20.083
...forget the safe? Go straight for
the cash drawer. Get in and get out.

526
00:40:21.001 --> 00:40:23.336
He's in the way.
Now I can't even get a shot.

527
00:40:23.629 --> 00:40:24.838
I can't either.

528
00:40:25.131 --> 00:40:27.298
Why are you hitting
mom-and-pop stores anyway?

529
00:40:27.508 --> 00:40:29.509
Look, you're a driver, man.

530
00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:33.805
You got skills. You can be out there
on the road, man, doing your shit.

531
00:40:34.014 --> 00:40:38.017
I'm desperate! l need some money!
And why the freak are we whispering?

532
00:40:39.937 --> 00:40:42.355
Back up, nigger! I saw you!

533
00:40:44.358 --> 00:40:46.734
-What are they talking about?
-l don't know.

534
00:40:47.027 --> 00:40:50.822
I'm working on something here,
and you're blowing it for me, man!

535
00:40:51.532 --> 00:40:53.491
I'm sorry, man. I'm messing up.

536
00:40:53.742 --> 00:40:55.827
-l'm messing up.
-lt's all right.

537
00:40:56.036 --> 00:40:57.704
Look, l'm not mad at you.

538
00:40:58.289 --> 00:41:02.292
But you're gonna have to give me
the gun and let me arrest you.

539
00:41:03.669 --> 00:41:08.631
Come on, man. Listen. l'll give you
1 0 grand. You know l'm good for it.

540
00:41:10.134 --> 00:41:11.551
I'm thinking like 50, man.

541
00:41:11.802 --> 00:41:15.305
Tulley, 50?
That's pushing it, man! Damn!

542
00:41:15.514 --> 00:41:19.392
Twenty, and you'll spend one night
in jail. That's the best I can do.

543
00:41:19.643 --> 00:41:21.561
That's it. Best l can do.

544
00:41:23.063 --> 00:41:25.565
All right, fine.
But l'm keeping my gun.

545
00:41:25.816 --> 00:41:29.819
You cannot let me arrest you
and keep the gun, man. Come on.

546
00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:32.697
Damn, l just got this, man.
This is hard to find.

547
00:41:32.907 --> 00:41:36.868
But you're gonna have to give up
the gun. Now, what you wanna do?

548
00:41:37.077 --> 00:41:41.664
You wanna give up the gun or you
want about seven bullets in your ass?

549
00:41:44.001 --> 00:41:45.585
Okay, now give me that gun!

550
00:41:46.086 --> 00:41:47.420
No.

551
00:41:47.922 --> 00:41:50.089
Don't just hand it to me.

552
00:41:50.382 --> 00:41:53.384
I gotta take it from you.
They're watching.

553
00:41:55.930 --> 00:41:57.430
This is gonna hurt a little.

554
00:41:58.349 --> 00:41:59.432
This is gonna hurt.

555
00:42:03.187 --> 00:42:04.312
Jesus!

556
00:42:04.563 --> 00:42:06.439
That's incredible!

557
00:42:07.024 --> 00:42:09.817
And remember:
You don't know me anymore.

558
00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:11.528
I sure don't.

559
00:42:11.737 --> 00:42:13.446
You didn't used to be so violent.

560
00:42:13.739 --> 00:42:15.782
So he's like,
"Carlson, take my jacket."

561
00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:19.327
He's like, "I got to do this."
We're like, "What are you doing?"

562
00:42:19.537 --> 00:42:22.872
He just goes right down the alley,
right up to the guy.

563
00:42:23.123 --> 00:42:25.708
Next thing you know,
he's taking the guy's gun.

564
00:42:25.918 --> 00:42:28.962
Dropped the guy with a punch.
Just levelled him.

565
00:42:29.213 --> 00:42:32.215
I mean, blink and
you would've missed it.

566
00:42:32.758 --> 00:42:34.342
Malone, in my office!

567
00:42:34.593 --> 00:42:36.052
Now!

568
00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:41.391
Not you, Carlson.

569
00:42:46.438 --> 00:42:48.481
I've been looking through your record.

570
00:42:48.899 --> 00:42:50.567
How come I never heard of you?

571
00:42:51.277 --> 00:42:53.653
I was undercover. On the down low.

572
00:42:53.862 --> 00:42:57.282
We need a guy to head Burglary.
Is that the real reason you're here?

573
00:42:58.784 --> 00:43:00.743
-Yeah, sure.
-lt's no secret.

574
00:43:00.911 --> 00:43:05.665
Burglary's been a problem since
we lost our lead detective last year.

575
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.668
Now, usually we promote
from within the ranks...

576
00:43:08.919 --> 00:43:10.837
...but these guys need someone new.

577
00:43:11.088 --> 00:43:13.381
So if you want the job, you got it.

578
00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:17.302
Excuse me?

579
00:43:17.636 --> 00:43:20.263
You're the new lead detective.
Burglary division.

580
00:43:22.808 --> 00:43:23.850
Me?

581
00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:30.690
Technically, there's a 30-day
period before l can make it official...

582
00:43:30.899 --> 00:43:34.193
...but with your record I don't think
there'll be any problem.

583
00:43:38.699 --> 00:43:40.533
Well, say something!

584
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:44.454
Thank you.

585
00:43:44.705 --> 00:43:46.164
Let's party?

586
00:43:49.043 --> 00:43:50.710
What is this? High school?

587
00:43:50.961 --> 00:43:56.049
Listen up. Now Detective Malone is
Burglary's new acting lead detective.

588
00:43:56.383 --> 00:43:58.801
Get these processed ASAP.

589
00:43:59.928 --> 00:44:01.387
Thank you.

590
00:44:03.223 --> 00:44:06.559
I got some things l gotta do.
I'll catch up with you later.

591
00:44:07.394 --> 00:44:08.645
I'll take these.

592
00:44:08.854 --> 00:44:10.730
-You know what to do with these?
-Sure.

593
00:44:10.981 --> 00:44:12.398
Great, sir. Sorry.

594
00:44:21.659 --> 00:44:23.409
-Captain Penelli?
-l'm busy now.

595
00:44:41.053 --> 00:44:42.845
Oh, man!

596
00:45:03.367 --> 00:45:04.951
Shit!

597
00:45:07.121 --> 00:45:08.496
Damn!

598
00:45:20.008 --> 00:45:21.217
What?

599
00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:24.053
How do you want me
to handle the rotation?

600
00:45:25.139 --> 00:45:27.265
I don't understand.
What you mean, "rotation"?

601
00:45:27.474 --> 00:45:29.142
The shifts.

602
00:45:30.269 --> 00:45:34.021
I can't figure out everything
on the first day, all right?

603
00:45:34.231 --> 00:45:37.066
I notice you guys had a leak here.
What's that about?

604
00:45:37.276 --> 00:45:40.027
One of the hot-water pipes burst,
flooded all the vents.

605
00:45:41.238 --> 00:45:43.656
They had to flush out
the whole system.

606
00:45:43.824 --> 00:45:46.409
This must be the guy
everybody's talking about.

607
00:45:46.618 --> 00:45:48.536
Captain Penelli, Detective Malone.

608
00:45:48.746 --> 00:45:50.079
Malone, Penelli.

609
00:45:50.998 --> 00:45:54.959
I hear great things.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

610
00:46:00.841 --> 00:46:02.675
Nice to meet you too there, sir!

611
00:46:02.926 --> 00:46:04.343
Very nice to meet you!

612
00:46:05.846 --> 00:46:07.096
Glad to be here.

613
00:46:07.347 --> 00:46:08.765
Gotta go!

614
00:46:12.561 --> 00:46:14.353
He's a strange one.

615
00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:31.704
Place is closed.

616
00:46:32.706 --> 00:46:35.583
I said we're closed.
I should've locked up.

617
00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:37.585
Nice to see you, Lou.

618
00:46:38.796 --> 00:46:40.463
I'm looking for Miles.

619
00:46:40.839 --> 00:46:42.882
Well, l haven't seen him.

620
00:46:43.133 --> 00:46:45.635
I got an important message
from his mother.

621
00:46:47.638 --> 00:46:49.597
Well, l still haven't seen him.

622
00:46:52.351 --> 00:46:53.643
Quiet.

623
00:46:58.690 --> 00:47:00.233
Damn, you're good.

624
00:47:05.614 --> 00:47:07.073
You are good.

625
00:47:50.659 --> 00:47:51.784
Good morning. Listen up.

626
00:47:51.952 --> 00:47:56.038
Word is that Jean LaFleur is bringing
a shipment of heroin through town.

627
00:47:58.375 --> 00:47:59.876
They want him in San Diego.

628
00:48:00.085 --> 00:48:02.128
San Diego's P.D.'s done
an excellent job...

629
00:48:02.421 --> 00:48:05.464
...shutting down the harbour
and the airports on him.

630
00:48:13.807 --> 00:48:18.311
Detective Malone just transferred.
He'll head our Burglary division.

631
00:48:19.313 --> 00:48:20.605
Detective...

632
00:48:20.814 --> 00:48:22.982
...tell us a little about your plans.

633
00:48:25.152 --> 00:48:27.904
Well, l plan to fight crime.

634
00:48:33.452 --> 00:48:34.827
You know, shit like that.

635
00:48:34.995 --> 00:48:36.037
Great, then.

636
00:48:37.331 --> 00:48:39.498
Does anybody have any questions
for Malone?

637
00:48:39.708 --> 00:48:41.417
Yeah, l got a question.

638
00:48:41.668 --> 00:48:43.586
What do you think about the P-31 ?

639
00:48:44.963 --> 00:48:46.505
P-31 .

640
00:48:48.675 --> 00:48:51.010
-What do you think?
-lt's a piece of shit.

641
00:48:51.178 --> 00:48:52.595
Diaz.

642
00:48:53.096 --> 00:48:57.016
What l mean is, we've all been having
problems with the P-31 , right?

643
00:48:57.225 --> 00:49:01.854
I'm just wondering what the new lead
detective here plans to do about it.

644
00:49:02.272 --> 00:49:05.650
Well, all right.
Well, Diaz, is it? Diaz?

645
00:49:05.984 --> 00:49:09.111
What do you think we should do
about it, Diaz?

646
00:49:09.488 --> 00:49:11.030
I think we should scrap it.

647
00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:14.825
How many people think
we should scrap the P-31 ?

648
00:49:17.371 --> 00:49:18.537
There it is.

649
00:49:18.747 --> 00:49:20.790
Scrapped. Why?
Because you want it scrapped.

650
00:49:20.999 --> 00:49:24.627
It's out of there. P-31 , out of there.
No more. Gone.

651
00:49:25.003 --> 00:49:27.004
You want 31 flavours?

652
00:49:27.214 --> 00:49:30.383
Baskin-Robbins is
where you wanna be. Be cool.

653
00:49:30.759 --> 00:49:32.385
That's my partner.

654
00:49:32.970 --> 00:49:34.011
Detective.

655
00:49:37.057 --> 00:49:38.891
What is it?

656
00:49:39.142 --> 00:49:40.768
I'd like to work with a P-40.

657
00:49:40.978 --> 00:49:42.144
Yeah, the P-40's good.

658
00:49:43.897 --> 00:49:45.398
P-40 it is!

659
00:49:50.028 --> 00:49:52.071
What's he doing?
We just got those things.

660
00:49:52.322 --> 00:49:55.574
He's shaking things up.
Maybe that's exactly what we need.

661
00:50:13.301 --> 00:50:14.927
I'm not a cop.

662
00:50:15.429 --> 00:50:17.930
This Tulley asshole
wants to talk to you.

663
00:50:18.181 --> 00:50:19.932
He's down in Interrogation.

664
00:50:21.727 --> 00:50:23.728
Right away. l'll talk with him.

665
00:50:24.604 --> 00:50:26.397
Interrogation's this way.

666
00:50:26.606 --> 00:50:28.941
Knew that. ls he running his mouth?

667
00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:32.945
Tulley says he has information
about another robbery.

668
00:50:33.113 --> 00:50:35.906
But he'll only talk
to the officer who arrested him.

669
00:50:37.534 --> 00:50:39.618
I'll talk to him. Alone.

670
00:50:39.828 --> 00:50:41.454
We'll be watching.

671
00:50:43.623 --> 00:50:47.084
What's going on? You said
I'd spend one night in jail.

672
00:50:58.096 --> 00:51:00.639
What do you wanna tell me?
What is it?

673
00:51:00.891 --> 00:51:02.975
You said I'd only spend
one night in jail.

674
00:51:03.143 --> 00:51:04.894
It's only been one night.

675
00:51:05.103 --> 00:51:06.979
Well, where's my 50 grand?

676
00:51:07.314 --> 00:51:09.106
I said 20 grand.

677
00:51:09.608 --> 00:51:11.776
Well, maybe it's 50 now! Because--

678
00:51:16.073 --> 00:51:19.658
Detectives, I've been assigned
to Mr. Tulley.

679
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:22.411
Well, great. That's him.

680
00:51:22.621 --> 00:51:25.581
Oh, my God! What in the world?

681
00:51:25.791 --> 00:51:27.291
-Help me!
-What's going on?

682
00:51:28.502 --> 00:51:30.836
-Help!
-What is this?

683
00:51:34.591 --> 00:51:36.300
Oh, my God!

684
00:51:40.514 --> 00:51:43.432
Take your hands off my client!

685
00:51:44.351 --> 00:51:45.893
It's no use. He ain't talking!

686
00:51:46.103 --> 00:51:48.020
You have your hand over his mouth!

687
00:51:54.027 --> 00:51:57.863
I think we accomplished
enough for one day.

688
00:51:58.198 --> 00:52:01.534
This guy said he has information
on another case.

689
00:52:01.827 --> 00:52:04.203
I wanna know, are you jerking
our chain or not?

690
00:52:04.412 --> 00:52:06.205
I'm not jerking your chain, fella.

691
00:52:06.414 --> 00:52:10.543
This guy Logan owes me
50 thousand dollars.

692
00:52:11.378 --> 00:52:13.337
If l don't get it soon...

693
00:52:13.547 --> 00:52:15.422
...l'm talking!

694
00:52:15.632 --> 00:52:18.134
Who's Logan?
And what do you know about him?

695
00:52:18.677 --> 00:52:22.638
All I can tell you, sir,
is that he's gay, gay, gay!

696
00:52:22.848 --> 00:52:24.431
I've had enough of this!

697
00:52:24.641 --> 00:52:28.519
You certainly have. Come with me.
You'll be hearing from my office!

698
00:52:28.728 --> 00:52:31.063
-He made me bite my tongue.
-Come here.

699
00:52:31.731 --> 00:52:32.773
He hit me here.

700
00:52:33.191 --> 00:52:35.317
Next time use a phone book on him.

701
00:52:35.527 --> 00:52:37.236
And they took my shoelace.

702
00:52:37.445 --> 00:52:39.071
Hearing from your office.

703
00:52:39.322 --> 00:52:41.198
Look how she's all over him.

704
00:52:41.449 --> 00:52:44.493
And then he said l was ugly
and l couldn't read good.

705
00:52:49.374 --> 00:52:51.000
Hey, man. What's up?

706
00:52:51.209 --> 00:52:53.252
Some guy's been calling for you.

707
00:52:53.461 --> 00:52:55.588
-Who was it?
-Said he's your old partner.

708
00:52:55.755 --> 00:52:57.882
He hopes you found
what you're looking for.

709
00:52:58.049 --> 00:52:59.758
Your health benefits expire soon.

710
00:53:00.093 --> 00:53:02.219
Whatever the hell
that's supposed to mean.

711
00:53:06.349 --> 00:53:08.058
Shit!

712
00:53:32.959 --> 00:53:33.959
Bingo!

713
00:53:37.255 --> 00:53:40.132
What is it with you
and the heating ducts, sir?

714
00:53:41.301 --> 00:53:42.885
Cold. You don't feel that?

715
00:53:43.386 --> 00:53:44.428
Very cold.

716
00:53:44.638 --> 00:53:47.056
But l'm busy. What is it you want?

717
00:53:47.265 --> 00:53:49.808
I just tried to pull up your records.

718
00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:51.518
I couldn't find any Malone.

719
00:53:52.103 --> 00:53:55.314
Oh, that's probably because
it was spelled....

720
00:53:55.565 --> 00:53:57.524
When I put the name in the list--

721
00:53:57.734 --> 00:53:59.777
The badge number doesn't exist.

722
00:54:01.655 --> 00:54:02.696
Let me talk to you.

723
00:54:02.864 --> 00:54:06.158
-l wanna find out what's going on.
-You're gonna find out.

724
00:54:09.412 --> 00:54:10.829
Now, look.

725
00:54:11.831 --> 00:54:13.832
What l'm about to tell you
is classified.

726
00:54:14.042 --> 00:54:18.003
You tell anyone, l will bust
your ass down to parade detail.

727
00:54:18.171 --> 00:54:19.672
I've been on that detail.

728
00:54:19.839 --> 00:54:22.925
That's permanent horseshit patrol.

729
00:54:25.845 --> 00:54:29.098
This place is a cesspool. But listen.

730
00:54:29.432 --> 00:54:30.849
I'm not from West Covina.

731
00:54:31.851 --> 00:54:33.352
I'm from Internal Affairs.

732
00:54:33.645 --> 00:54:35.854
Oh, man!

733
00:54:39.985 --> 00:54:42.611
All right? This place is a cesspool.

734
00:54:43.321 --> 00:54:45.864
-l can't believe l didn't notice.
-lt is.

735
00:54:46.116 --> 00:54:48.284
I mean,
it doesn't seem like a cesspool.

736
00:54:48.493 --> 00:54:51.704
Believe it, man. There's a lot
of dirty shit going on here.

737
00:54:51.955 --> 00:54:53.789
That's why they sent me here.

738
00:54:53.999 --> 00:54:56.625
I'm the supercop.
They said, "Go, investigate.

739
00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:58.877
Do what you do.
Find another supercop.

740
00:54:59.087 --> 00:55:02.047
Y'all supercop up as a team,
and crack down the shit."

741
00:55:02.382 --> 00:55:04.591
"Crack it down."
That's what l'm here to do.

742
00:55:04.801 --> 00:55:08.220
Are we the only guys that know
about it? We're in the shit now!

743
00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:15.394
You are a good cop, Carlson.

744
00:55:15.645 --> 00:55:18.480
But damn it, man,
you just dug too deep.

745
00:55:18.690 --> 00:55:20.357
What do you want me to do?

746
00:55:20.567 --> 00:55:22.359
Good thing you asked.

747
00:55:22.986 --> 00:55:26.905
Keep your eyes open. Okay?
I need you to be here.

748
00:55:27.115 --> 00:55:29.408
And watch my back. Watch my back.

749
00:55:29.617 --> 00:55:32.161
Got it, sir. l'm out of here.

750
00:55:32.746 --> 00:55:34.246
The other way. Go back.

751
00:55:38.668 --> 00:55:39.877
Shit!

752
00:55:59.439 --> 00:56:01.023
Evidence room.

753
00:56:01.358 --> 00:56:02.399
Shit!

754
00:56:05.945 --> 00:56:08.947
There you are. l just got a call.

755
00:56:09.199 --> 00:56:10.783
41 3 in progress
at the airport.

756
00:56:11.034 --> 00:56:12.242
Go ahead. l'll catch up.

757
00:56:12.452 --> 00:56:16.455
Bullshit! Someone just stole
a museum exhibit from a cargo hold.

758
00:56:16.706 --> 00:56:17.915
That's my problem?

759
00:56:18.291 --> 00:56:19.708
You're lead detective.

760
00:56:21.127 --> 00:56:22.294
Get out there now!

761
00:56:22.462 --> 00:56:25.964
The FBI and Customs Service
is already on the case.

762
00:56:46.111 --> 00:56:48.487
-Why are you standing here?
-They won't let me in.

763
00:56:48.738 --> 00:56:50.155
Feds are all over it.

764
00:56:50.323 --> 00:56:51.949
That's bullshit!

765
00:56:53.326 --> 00:56:56.495
These boxes contained
an entire Egyptian temple.

766
00:56:56.704 --> 00:56:59.289
Excuse me, here.
Let me see this. Man!

767
00:56:59.499 --> 00:57:00.624
And who are you?

768
00:57:00.834 --> 00:57:03.460
Malone. LAPD.

769
00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:05.421
Agent Gray. FBl.

770
00:57:06.464 --> 00:57:09.174
We'll let you boys in
after we're done.

771
00:57:11.970 --> 00:57:13.470
Look at all this stuff.

772
00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:17.933
Look. They nearly destroyed all this
stuff, and they didn't take none of it.

773
00:57:18.184 --> 00:57:20.310
Look, Officer Malone.

774
00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:21.770
Detective.

775
00:57:21.980 --> 00:57:26.275
You know, you're out of your
jurisdiction, and you're over your head.

776
00:57:26.484 --> 00:57:29.736
I'm over my head?
No, I'm over your head...

777
00:57:29.946 --> 00:57:31.864
...because your head's up your ass.

778
00:57:33.741 --> 00:57:37.870
You're interfering with
a federal investigation, officer.

779
00:57:38.329 --> 00:57:41.123
Now, if you and your bunch
wanna feel important...

780
00:57:41.332 --> 00:57:43.667
...you can help secure
the outer perimeter.

781
00:57:44.461 --> 00:57:45.627
Are we clear?

782
00:57:48.882 --> 00:57:50.632
We clear.

783
00:57:51.134 --> 00:57:52.801
And please...

784
00:57:53.011 --> 00:57:56.763
...tell your men not to touch
anything on their way out.

785
00:57:56.973 --> 00:57:59.808
-lt's like that?
-Yeah, it's like that.

786
00:58:09.986 --> 00:58:11.904
"Head up your ass."
That was great.

787
00:58:12.155 --> 00:58:14.406
I couldn't believe you said that.

788
00:58:14.699 --> 00:58:16.575
He called me "officer."

789
00:58:16.826 --> 00:58:21.747
I'm lead detective.
I have 1 6 citations.

790
00:58:21.915 --> 00:58:23.415
You think that comes easy?

791
00:58:23.583 --> 00:58:26.251
Come on. The guy's nothing
but an FBl asshole.

792
00:58:26.419 --> 00:58:29.421
He thinks we're good for nothing
but sucking down doughnuts.

793
00:58:29.672 --> 00:58:31.590
Let them chase their own
goddamn temple.

794
00:58:31.841 --> 00:58:35.552
They weren't looking for no temple.
They were looking for drugs.

795
00:58:35.762 --> 00:58:37.012
Yes, drugs.

796
00:58:37.222 --> 00:58:39.097
It's the oldest trick in the book.

797
00:58:39.307 --> 00:58:40.390
You smuggle it in...

798
00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:44.937
...boost it before it hits customs,
right? Make it look like a heist.

799
00:58:45.188 --> 00:58:47.064
That's how all the big boys do it.

800
00:58:47.315 --> 00:58:50.234
All they have to do is
look for a truck with a B on it.

801
00:58:50.693 --> 00:58:51.944
What do you mean, B?

802
00:58:52.195 --> 00:58:53.612
"Bonded."

803
00:58:54.030 --> 00:58:57.950
Bonded trucks can get
into bonded warehouses.

804
00:58:58.451 --> 00:58:59.493
Let me ask you:

805
00:59:00.036 --> 00:59:01.745
How do you know all this stuff?

806
00:59:03.623 --> 00:59:06.959
Did a little work
in bonded warehouses.

807
00:59:07.460 --> 00:59:09.711
All right. So what are we waiting for?

808
00:59:10.129 --> 00:59:13.590
Let's do something, all right?
Come on. Call in air support.

809
00:59:14.842 --> 00:59:17.636
Dispatch, this is 37-King-5...

810
00:59:17.887 --> 00:59:21.431
...put me through
to South Bay air support.

811
00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:29.648
1 0-1 2. l've got a white panel truck...

812
00:59:29.857 --> 00:59:34.152
...B-961 , southbound on Wheeler
near Manhattan Beach intersection.

813
00:59:34.404 --> 00:59:36.113
Roger. We're close.

814
00:59:39.826 --> 00:59:40.993
Shit!

815
00:59:45.748 --> 00:59:47.124
Now you're in a hurry?

816
00:59:48.001 --> 00:59:50.836
Sometimes you gotta feed
a little speed to your ride.

817
00:59:51.004 --> 00:59:52.337
You know what l'm saying?

818
01:00:04.183 --> 01:00:05.309
Here we go.

819
01:00:09.314 --> 01:00:10.981
Check out the driver.

820
01:00:12.108 --> 01:00:15.402
Five-feet-six, greasy hair, messy,
very dishevelled and--

821
01:00:15.612 --> 01:00:18.363
Are you a hairdresser
or a detective, man?

822
01:00:19.699 --> 01:00:21.033
That's a jailhouse tat.

823
01:00:21.492 --> 01:00:23.327
Driver did a stretch somewhere.

824
01:00:23.536 --> 01:00:25.287
Ten-twelve. Requesting backup.

825
01:00:25.496 --> 01:00:27.873
LAPD, this is Agent Gray. FBI.

826
01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:31.335
Stand down. I repeat: Stand down.

827
01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:33.128
This is bullshit!

828
01:00:33.338 --> 01:00:36.006
Screw them. Come on! Let's do it!

829
01:00:36.841 --> 01:00:38.383
Come on, you!

830
01:00:40.303 --> 01:00:41.511
Come on, get the door.

831
01:00:41.721 --> 01:00:42.721
Come on!

832
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:47.059
Drop your weapons!
Put it down.

833
01:00:47.226 --> 01:00:50.437
All right, don't move! Stand still!

834
01:00:50.647 --> 01:00:51.688
Put it down!

835
01:00:52.231 --> 01:00:54.733
Malone! Take him! He's yours!

836
01:00:56.319 --> 01:00:58.737
Don't you run from me! Don't you run!

837
01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:01.198
Let's see those hands, butterball.

838
01:01:03.368 --> 01:01:05.994
Come here!
You wanna make me run?

839
01:01:11.459 --> 01:01:33.605
Come back here!

840
01:01:37.443 --> 01:01:38.610
Bring your ass here!

841
01:01:39.195 --> 01:01:47.536
Come here!

842
01:01:48.246 --> 01:01:50.247
It's okay. Don't worry. l'm a cop.

843
01:01:52.125 --> 01:01:53.375
All right?

844
01:01:54.627 --> 01:01:55.669
Damn!

845
01:02:00.466 --> 01:02:02.718
Don't you know better
than to run from the police?

846
01:02:02.927 --> 01:02:06.555
-l do.
-You got me tired. l don't like tired.

847
01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:09.141
When I get tired, I got ass to whup.

848
01:02:09.767 --> 01:02:12.310
That's what l'm about to do.
Get your ass up!

849
01:02:17.316 --> 01:02:18.567
Bingo.

850
01:02:18.818 --> 01:02:20.485
That's the shit.

851
01:02:25.116 --> 01:02:29.327
We showed them, and
that's what l wanted to do, you know?

852
01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:31.413
-Put this into evidence.
-Exactly.

853
01:02:31.622 --> 01:02:33.331
Evidence. l'll go up with it.

854
01:02:33.583 --> 01:02:35.792
I want you interrogating
those men right now.

855
01:02:36.002 --> 01:02:38.503
No. See, I need to go up
with this stuff...

856
01:02:38.671 --> 01:02:40.922
...and book it into evidence personally.

857
01:02:41.132 --> 01:02:42.174
Why?

858
01:02:43.843 --> 01:02:46.595
I gotta go through it
for clues and shit.

859
01:02:47.138 --> 01:02:50.265
Interrogate the suspects.
Find out where they were going.

860
01:02:50.808 --> 01:02:55.103
When you get them to talk, you can
go through all the evidence you want.

861
01:02:55.313 --> 01:02:57.189
But, sir....

862
01:02:58.107 --> 01:03:02.778
If l get the clue, it'd make for
a better ass-whupping interrogation.

863
01:03:02.987 --> 01:03:04.863
Let's hear it for Detective Malone!

864
01:03:17.376 --> 01:03:20.170
That's it! I want a lawyer.
You cops can't do this.

865
01:03:20.379 --> 01:03:22.005
I got news for you.
I ain't a cop.

866
01:03:24.550 --> 01:03:26.009
God, he's good.

867
01:03:26.219 --> 01:03:28.595
I checked.
West Covina never heard of him.

868
01:03:29.597 --> 01:03:31.681
-So you know.
-Know what?

869
01:03:31.891 --> 01:03:33.308
He's Internal Affairs.

870
01:03:33.518 --> 01:03:35.644
What are you talking about?
He's not I.A.

871
01:03:35.853 --> 01:03:39.105
-He's not?
-Hell, no. He's FBI.

872
01:03:39.649 --> 01:03:41.691
But he hates the FBl.

873
01:03:41.901 --> 01:03:44.903
That's to throw you off.
You think this is an accident?

874
01:03:45.154 --> 01:03:48.740
He knew about the heroin
from the start. FBI planted him here.

875
01:03:48.991 --> 01:03:52.619
Thought he'd get first jump on the
burglary. Afraid we'd screw it up.

876
01:03:52.912 --> 01:03:54.663
Pencil-dicks.

877
01:03:58.251 --> 01:04:00.752
You don't get that training
at the academy.

878
01:04:01.003 --> 01:04:02.754
No, that's old school, man.

879
01:04:02.922 --> 01:04:04.714
You're crushing my head!

880
01:04:07.218 --> 01:04:09.052
That's federal government training.

881
01:04:09.262 --> 01:04:11.847
Like Navy SEAL stuff.

882
01:04:14.392 --> 01:04:16.142
Let's go give him a hand.

883
01:04:18.604 --> 01:04:21.857
All right! All right!
I'll talk! Oh, man!

884
01:04:55.683 --> 01:04:57.559
Look at you.

885
01:04:57.768 --> 01:05:01.229
It was all worth it for you, baby.

886
01:05:07.737 --> 01:05:09.112
What are you doing up there?

887
01:05:10.323 --> 01:05:15.118
I'm just so happy that we're keeping
these drugs off the street.

888
01:05:15.328 --> 01:05:17.996
Get over it. They're going
right back out again.

889
01:05:18.205 --> 01:05:21.124
-Why?
-Because the FBl wants to take it...

890
01:05:21.292 --> 01:05:22.584
...to their lab right away.

891
01:05:22.793 --> 01:05:23.919
Roll it out.

892
01:05:28.507 --> 01:05:29.549
Malone, come on!

893
01:05:29.842 --> 01:05:31.301
Let's go.

894
01:05:32.803 --> 01:05:34.012
Come on, Malone.

895
01:05:47.234 --> 01:05:48.443
Detective.

896
01:05:49.612 --> 01:05:52.322
That heroin belongs to Jean LaFleur.

897
01:05:52.698 --> 01:05:54.324
We've been after him for 5 years.

898
01:05:54.533 --> 01:05:57.494
He keeps shifting his operations
between the U.S. and Mexico.

899
01:05:57.828 --> 01:06:00.163
We're taking it down
to our lab right now.

900
01:06:00.373 --> 01:06:01.873
That's not a good idea.

901
01:06:02.124 --> 01:06:03.166
Why not?

902
01:06:04.669 --> 01:06:06.378
Why don't we just keep it here?

903
01:06:06.629 --> 01:06:10.048
LaFleur doesn't know we have it.
We could use it for bait.

904
01:06:11.384 --> 01:06:12.550
You mean a sting?

905
01:06:12.885 --> 01:06:15.512
Exactly. A sting!

906
01:06:16.389 --> 01:06:20.225
LaFleur expects these drugs
to be in San Diego in three hours.

907
01:06:20.476 --> 01:06:23.812
What kind of sting operation can you
get off the ground before then?

908
01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:27.273
The driver told me one of the guys
on the truck was new.

909
01:06:27.483 --> 01:06:29.567
You can replace him
with somebody else.

910
01:06:29.777 --> 01:06:33.738
Then catch LaFleur when he goes
to pick up the drugs. Bam, got him!

911
01:06:33.906 --> 01:06:35.281
Let me get this straight.

912
01:06:35.491 --> 01:06:39.369
You're volunteering to escort
these drugs into the hands...

913
01:06:39.578 --> 01:06:42.580
...of the most dangerous dealer
in the northern hemisphere?

914
01:06:42.915 --> 01:06:43.915
Hell, no!

915
01:06:44.166 --> 01:06:45.834
What do you need to make it work?

916
01:06:47.378 --> 01:06:49.796
-Me?
-You're the man for the job!

917
01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:52.882
FBI will have tactical command,
but we'll follow your lead.

918
01:06:53.092 --> 01:06:56.052
It's very brave. Let's go.
There's not much time.

919
01:06:56.262 --> 01:06:58.054
Way to go, Malone. Way to go.

920
01:06:58.305 --> 01:07:01.850
-l'm just suggesting some shit.
-We need more men like you!

921
01:07:04.937 --> 01:07:07.939
All right. Hurry up.
Go. Get out of here!

922
01:07:08.232 --> 01:07:10.025
Wait. Hold up. Wait a minute.

923
01:07:10.234 --> 01:07:13.319
You wanted to go.
I'm getting you out of here. Go!

924
01:07:13.571 --> 01:07:16.406
You wouldn't still be here
unless that diamond was here.

925
01:07:16.615 --> 01:07:17.615
I want my cut!

926
01:07:17.867 --> 01:07:21.202
There ain't nothing to cut.
I gotta get the diamond first.

927
01:07:21.454 --> 01:07:22.620
Go get it. l'll wait.

928
01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:25.874
I'm trying to. First, l gotta
run a sting on a drug dealer.

929
01:07:26.250 --> 01:07:27.625
You're a goddamn liar!

930
01:07:27.835 --> 01:07:30.628
Would I make this shit up?
Get out of here!

931
01:07:30.838 --> 01:07:33.965
-l'll see you at Lou's tomorrow.
-l wanna talk about this!

932
01:07:34.133 --> 01:07:36.134
I don't know what you're doing...

933
01:07:36.385 --> 01:07:37.844
...but it ain't gonna work!

934
01:07:38.095 --> 01:07:39.929
And let me get my gun back!

935
01:07:46.395 --> 01:07:50.148
Look. Maybe this isn't
a good idea, you know?

936
01:07:50.399 --> 01:07:53.359
-This is a great idea. lt'll work.
-Brilliant.

937
01:07:53.569 --> 01:07:56.946
-LaFleur's looking for this.
-We know what we're doing, detective.

938
01:07:57.156 --> 01:07:58.907
Oh, l'm a detective now.

939
01:07:59.617 --> 01:08:00.992
Give us a level, please.

940
01:08:02.119 --> 01:08:03.578
All right, detective.

941
01:08:03.788 --> 01:08:07.999
The objective is to have these men
see you as if you were one of them:

942
01:08:08.375 --> 01:08:12.087
A member of the criminal underworld.
It's important your speech...

943
01:08:12.338 --> 01:08:17.175
...and your behaviour are congruent
with their expectation of a criminal.

944
01:08:17.384 --> 01:08:20.011
I get it. Sort of "walk the walk."

945
01:08:20.262 --> 01:08:21.304
That's right.

946
01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:24.265
You have to look, act...

947
01:08:24.475 --> 01:08:26.768
...and even think like a criminal.

948
01:08:26.977 --> 01:08:28.770
Change your speech patterns too.

949
01:08:29.021 --> 01:08:33.191
Criminals like to use slang
terminology, profanity and so forth...

950
01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:36.694
...especially with regard to police
and authority figures.

951
01:08:36.987 --> 01:08:39.697
You mean like, "Shut the hell up,
you dickless FBl--"

952
01:08:39.949 --> 01:08:41.699
-That's right.
-"You stupid ass."

953
01:08:41.951 --> 01:08:43.326
-That'll do.
-"You tight--"

954
01:08:43.536 --> 01:08:44.702
Enough!

955
01:08:46.539 --> 01:08:47.622
All right, listen up.

956
01:08:47.832 --> 01:08:49.541
LaFleur's a killer.

957
01:08:49.792 --> 01:08:54.546
If he senses anything amiss, Malone
is gonna be in one hell of a tight spot.

958
01:08:59.927 --> 01:09:03.346
If anything happens to me,
forget everything l ever told you.

959
01:09:03.556 --> 01:09:05.640
You mean about lnternal Affairs?

960
01:09:05.850 --> 01:09:07.642
No, Carlson. I mean about everything.

961
01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:09.936
Detective, saddle up.

962
01:09:10.146 --> 01:09:11.729
Good luck.

963
01:09:16.193 --> 01:09:19.070
Carlson, remember. Forget it!

964
01:09:19.238 --> 01:09:20.405
Time to go.

965
01:09:22.992 --> 01:09:24.033
Detective.

966
01:09:24.535 --> 01:09:28.329
If my client gets a scratch
on him while he's in your custody...

967
01:09:28.539 --> 01:09:33.543
...l'll see your badge is revoked
and you're thrown in jail. Okay?

968
01:09:33.752 --> 01:09:35.253
You can't touch me.

969
01:09:38.424 --> 01:09:42.093
He'll be fine, counsellor. Malone,
let's get this show on the road.

970
01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:44.846
Drive. Buckle up.

971
01:09:47.892 --> 01:09:50.393
-Give me video.
-Let's get one thing straight.

972
01:09:50.603 --> 01:09:53.271
This is my side here
and that's your side there.

973
01:09:53.522 --> 01:09:55.732
Stay on your side
and l'm gonna stay on mine.

974
01:09:56.442 --> 01:09:59.110
Gentlemen.
Keep the chatter to a minimum.

975
01:09:59.361 --> 01:10:02.405
You don't like the show,
change the channel.

976
01:10:02.781 --> 01:10:04.949
And keep this channel clear.

977
01:10:08.704 --> 01:10:10.538
Who is this guy?

978
01:10:10.998 --> 01:10:12.081
That's Malone.

979
01:10:13.792 --> 01:10:15.251
I can't drive if you do that.

980
01:10:15.794 --> 01:10:17.212
Drive!

981
01:10:36.899 --> 01:10:38.316
We're coming up on our exit.

982
01:10:40.236 --> 01:10:43.488
All units, this is Gray.
Fall back and keep your distance.

983
01:10:53.791 --> 01:10:55.250
We're approaching the site.

984
01:10:55.459 --> 01:10:57.794
LAPD, take the south side.
We'll take the north.

985
01:11:22.778 --> 01:11:25.321
They're headed into warehouse 3.

986
01:11:25.572 --> 01:11:27.699
Focus in. Closer.

987
01:11:35.708 --> 01:11:36.749
This is it.

988
01:11:36.917 --> 01:11:38.793
-You sure?
-Yeah. Warehouse 3.

989
01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:43.381
All right, Benny, sit tight
and keep your mouth shut.

990
01:11:43.632 --> 01:11:44.841
Thanks for the tip.

991
01:11:51.473 --> 01:11:52.682
What's Malone doing?

992
01:12:00.482 --> 01:12:02.400
They're coming in behind you.

993
01:12:02.609 --> 01:12:04.527
Get ready. Here he comes.

994
01:12:09.575 --> 01:12:11.826
That's what l'm talking about!

995
01:12:12.619 --> 01:12:14.704
-That's the shit.
-You're right!

996
01:12:14.913 --> 01:12:17.123
All 500 kilos!

997
01:12:17.916 --> 01:12:21.127
What are you talking about?
Let's get out! l want my cut!

998
01:12:21.337 --> 01:12:23.421
-You still got it?
-We still have a signal.

999
01:12:23.672 --> 01:12:24.756
It's just distorted.

1000
01:12:25.924 --> 01:12:27.133
Can you hear him?

1001
01:12:27.343 --> 01:12:30.511
We can't get out of here, okay?
They got cops everywhere.

1002
01:12:30.721 --> 01:12:34.057
-So? You're one of them.
-No, no, no.

1003
01:12:34.224 --> 01:12:35.433
I'm a drug dealer now.

1004
01:12:35.934 --> 01:12:38.895
Man, listen to me.
You're a jewel thief.

1005
01:12:39.438 --> 01:12:41.606
I'm a drug dealer now!

1006
01:12:41.774 --> 01:12:44.442
Why you selling this
when you got that diamond?

1007
01:12:45.194 --> 01:12:46.361
Just like old times.

1008
01:12:47.237 --> 01:12:49.072
I don't believe that shit!

1009
01:12:51.116 --> 01:12:52.283
Is this a reunion?

1010
01:12:52.534 --> 01:12:55.536
Look what we got here. Give it up.

1011
01:12:56.413 --> 01:12:58.247
Isn't that beautiful? Say bye.

1012
01:12:59.041 --> 01:13:00.083
Welcome to the party.

1013
01:13:00.376 --> 01:13:01.417
Son of a bitch!

1014
01:13:02.169 --> 01:13:03.461
We've lost him.

1015
01:13:03.670 --> 01:13:06.297
I'll enjoy doing you more
than l did Eddie.

1016
01:13:06.799 --> 01:13:07.965
Shut up!

1017
01:13:17.101 --> 01:13:18.768
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1018
01:13:18.977 --> 01:13:21.145
-Know anything about this?
-l don't know shit!

1019
01:13:21.313 --> 01:13:22.772
I'm gonna throw up.

1020
01:13:30.322 --> 01:13:33.658
What the hell? All units, stand by.

1021
01:13:38.914 --> 01:13:40.998
-What's going on?
-l don't know!

1022
01:13:42.084 --> 01:13:43.626
I never know what's going on!

1023
01:13:49.591 --> 01:13:51.759
Take it down! Here. Bring it in.

1024
01:14:00.853 --> 01:14:02.645
Out of the truck. Out of the truck!

1025
01:14:08.235 --> 01:14:09.694
Benny, what's going on?

1026
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:11.487
It took longer than I thought.

1027
01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:14.866
-What happened to your face?
-Nothing. Not a big deal.

1028
01:14:15.033 --> 01:14:16.451
Who hired these two guys?

1029
01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:18.453
I did. You told me to get guys.

1030
01:14:19.371 --> 01:14:21.372
You didn't introduce me.
How you doing?

1031
01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:24.375
Pete. Nice to meet you.
Heard a lot about you.

1032
01:14:26.044 --> 01:14:27.336
And who might you be?

1033
01:14:28.505 --> 01:14:31.340
Don't mess with him.
That's a stone-cold killer.

1034
01:14:31.758 --> 01:14:34.510
You don't want to mess with him.
He's stone-cold.

1035
01:14:35.137 --> 01:14:40.057
That boy is bad. l seen him rip
somebody's guts through their ass...

1036
01:14:40.350 --> 01:14:41.893
...and their eyes fell out.

1037
01:14:42.144 --> 01:14:43.186
Do the move you do!

1038
01:14:43.395 --> 01:14:45.563
The gut-and-eyes move.

1039
01:14:54.907 --> 01:14:57.325
That's where they went splat.
Just dropped them.

1040
01:14:57.534 --> 01:14:58.659
I'm bad.

1041
01:14:59.036 --> 01:15:02.997
I'll rip your lips off and
kiss my ass with them shits.

1042
01:15:03.207 --> 01:15:04.248
I seen him do it.

1043
01:15:04.416 --> 01:15:05.917
I do that.
That's how l get down.

1044
01:15:06.168 --> 01:15:09.337
I'll rip your tongue out
and lick my balls with them.

1045
01:15:09.546 --> 01:15:10.713
Shut up.

1046
01:15:11.215 --> 01:15:12.256
Check him out.

1047
01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:15.760
Francois, you search him.

1048
01:15:16.595 --> 01:15:18.387
-We're moving in.
-No, wait.

1049
01:15:18.722 --> 01:15:21.182
This must be a part of his plan.

1050
01:15:21.391 --> 01:15:23.893
What plan?
He's unarmed and outnumbered.

1051
01:15:24.102 --> 01:15:26.812
Trust me.
You should see Malone's résumé.

1052
01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:30.358
This is like a walk in the park
for him.

1053
01:15:30.943 --> 01:15:32.735
I must tell you, Pete.

1054
01:15:33.529 --> 01:15:35.196
You look the part...

1055
01:15:35.697 --> 01:15:37.615
...you certainly talk the talk...

1056
01:15:39.284 --> 01:15:41.619
...but you still stink like a cop.

1057
01:15:42.788 --> 01:15:44.622
Damn it!
I knew he would catch us, man.

1058
01:15:44.831 --> 01:15:46.541
Shut up! That's bullshit.

1059
01:15:46.792 --> 01:15:50.545
Come on, man. Just talk to him.
We might get out of here!

1060
01:15:51.463 --> 01:15:52.880
See? He's lying!

1061
01:15:53.090 --> 01:15:57.260
If l was a cop, would I have busted
his shit? That's bleeding!

1062
01:15:57.469 --> 01:15:58.636
Lock him in the car.

1063
01:15:59.137 --> 01:16:00.346
Get him out of here.

1064
01:16:00.556 --> 01:16:01.597
If l was a cop--

1065
01:16:01.890 --> 01:16:02.974
Shut up!

1066
01:16:05.143 --> 01:16:06.811
My nose bleeding!

1067
01:16:07.104 --> 01:16:08.312
Damn!

1068
01:16:08.772 --> 01:16:10.106
You better tell us the truth.

1069
01:16:11.567 --> 01:16:13.109
He's a cop.

1070
01:16:13.777 --> 01:16:16.112
He hijacked the truck. This is a setup.

1071
01:16:16.321 --> 01:16:19.448
If l was a cop, FBIs would be
in here right now, man...

1072
01:16:19.658 --> 01:16:21.117
...taking everybody to jail!

1073
01:16:22.619 --> 01:16:23.995
I think...

1074
01:16:24.496 --> 01:16:26.163
...l have an idea.

1075
01:16:32.838 --> 01:16:34.672
You wanna prove you aren't a cop?

1076
01:16:37.509 --> 01:16:38.551
You say he's lying.

1077
01:16:40.137 --> 01:16:41.178
Damn right.

1078
01:16:41.346 --> 01:16:45.266
Shoot him.

1079
01:16:45.851 --> 01:16:46.851
No problem.

1080
01:16:49.271 --> 01:16:51.814
-You son of a bitch!
-l meant, kill him.

1081
01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:56.277
You didn't say that.
You just said, "Shoot him."

1082
01:16:57.529 --> 01:16:59.447
You wanna prove you aren't a cop?

1083
01:17:00.824 --> 01:17:02.283
Kill him.

1084
01:17:05.704 --> 01:17:07.705
There ain't no coming back for him.

1085
01:17:18.425 --> 01:17:21.218
That's it. We're moving in.
All units, move in.

1086
01:17:22.179 --> 01:17:23.220
Let's go!

1087
01:17:48.538 --> 01:17:49.580
Shit!

1088
01:17:54.711 --> 01:17:57.254
Give me the diamond or
I'll pop one in your ass!

1089
01:17:57.506 --> 01:17:58.756
You had your chance.

1090
01:18:09.226 --> 01:18:10.351
Freeze! LAPD!

1091
01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:12.103
Show me your hands!

1092
01:18:17.359 --> 01:18:18.401
Nice shot.

1093
01:18:22.572 --> 01:18:24.782
Get out of the car! Turn around!

1094
01:18:34.042 --> 01:18:35.084
Shit!

1095
01:19:16.585 --> 01:19:18.461
All units, this is Agent Gray, FBI.

1096
01:19:18.670 --> 01:19:21.672
We have no authority to pursue
the suspect beyond our border.

1097
01:19:22.048 --> 01:19:23.966
Do not cross into Mexico!

1098
01:19:45.155 --> 01:19:49.492
Pursuit heading southbound. We have
an undercover officer onboard.

1099
01:19:49.701 --> 01:19:52.369
I repeat: We have
a friendly onboard. Over!

1100
01:19:52.621 --> 01:19:53.662
Roger that!

1101
01:20:03.215 --> 01:20:04.381
Hold on!

1102
01:20:21.399 --> 01:20:22.650
Shit!

1103
01:21:17.163 --> 01:21:18.581
Look out!

1104
01:21:31.177 --> 01:21:33.262
Get him! l'm glad to see y'all!

1105
01:21:33.889 --> 01:21:35.472
What you waiting for? Go!

1106
01:21:35.724 --> 01:21:38.142
We can't, Malone.
We have no jurisdiction.

1107
01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:40.811
Damn that! Damn the jurisdiction!
Go! Now!

1108
01:21:40.979 --> 01:21:43.314
We cannot cross into Mexico.

1109
01:21:43.690 --> 01:21:45.733
-You can't? You can't?
-No. No!

1110
01:21:45.901 --> 01:21:47.192
Watch me.

1111
01:21:48.695 --> 01:21:49.737
Believe that!

1112
01:21:50.822 --> 01:21:52.573
Move your ass!

1113
01:22:17.599 --> 01:22:19.141
Damn it! One bullet.

1114
01:22:30.487 --> 01:22:31.528
Come on, Miles!

1115
01:22:37.744 --> 01:22:38.786
Shit!

1116
01:23:14.072 --> 01:23:16.907
-You're under arrest.
-What are you doing?

1117
01:23:17.075 --> 01:23:19.493
I'm arresting you before they get here.

1118
01:23:19.703 --> 01:23:21.912
I'll blow your head off
before they get here.

1119
01:23:23.289 --> 01:23:26.166
The way l see it
is you got 30 seconds...

1120
01:23:26.376 --> 01:23:28.752
...before they make
a piñata out of you.

1121
01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:30.212
What are they talking about?

1122
01:23:31.381 --> 01:23:33.716
Malone is an expert negotiator.

1123
01:23:33.925 --> 01:23:35.092
He's an expert, sir.

1124
01:23:36.511 --> 01:23:37.928
You got two choices.

1125
01:23:38.263 --> 01:23:40.389
You can wind up somebody's bitch...

1126
01:23:40.765 --> 01:23:42.307
...or somebody's señorita.

1127
01:23:42.517 --> 01:23:44.309
Make up your mind. Your choice.

1128
01:23:44.602 --> 01:23:47.563
I got three choices.
Maybe I just tell them who you are.

1129
01:23:47.772 --> 01:23:51.692
You'll shut your mouth. Maybe
I'll cut you in on the diamond.

1130
01:23:52.110 --> 01:23:55.946
Shithead, l got the goddamn diamond.

1131
01:23:56.197 --> 01:23:58.240
Let me get that.
I'm your only way out!

1132
01:23:58.742 --> 01:24:00.451
Now, give me the gun.

1133
01:24:00.660 --> 01:24:02.369
You don't wanna go to jail
in Mexico.

1134
01:24:02.579 --> 01:24:06.665
Nobody wanna go to jail in Mexico.
They put burritos in your ass.

1135
01:24:06.833 --> 01:24:07.958
Shut up!

1136
01:24:08.126 --> 01:24:11.086
Come on, Deke. Give me the gun.
Come on!

1137
01:24:11.296 --> 01:24:15.257
They think I'm a cop!
They think I'm a cop, man!

1138
01:24:15.467 --> 01:24:17.468
I can help you, okay?

1139
01:24:17.719 --> 01:24:20.637
You don't wanna die here.
Now give that up.

1140
01:24:20.847 --> 01:24:23.849
If you screw me, l swear to God,
I'll come back for you.

1141
01:24:24.059 --> 01:24:25.726
I'll come back for you!

1142
01:24:25.977 --> 01:24:27.102
Give me the gun!

1143
01:24:29.647 --> 01:24:32.107
There you go.
Let me get that from you.

1144
01:24:32.484 --> 01:24:34.443
Come on. Let it go.

1145
01:24:38.782 --> 01:24:40.616
There you go.

1146
01:24:46.498 --> 01:24:47.998
This is gonna hurt a bit.

1147
01:24:50.668 --> 01:24:51.794
Holy Christ!

1148
01:24:55.757 --> 01:24:56.799
That's for Eddie.

1149
01:25:02.514 --> 01:25:04.014
You son of a bitch!

1150
01:25:04.182 --> 01:25:05.682
Come back here!

1151
01:25:05.975 --> 01:25:07.101
You son of a bitch!

1152
01:25:07.977 --> 01:25:09.311
Miles, you die!

1153
01:25:44.055 --> 01:25:45.347
You all right?

1154
01:25:46.224 --> 01:25:48.559
I needed a vacation anway, right?

1155
01:25:50.311 --> 01:25:53.021
The FBI needs to talk to you,
Detective Malone.

1156
01:25:57.402 --> 01:26:01.071
Peterson, regional director, FBI.
We need to talk.

1157
01:26:01.322 --> 01:26:03.448
Wait a minute. Slow down.

1158
01:26:03.658 --> 01:26:05.534
No, lieutenant, I will not slow down.

1159
01:26:05.827 --> 01:26:07.953
Is this man one of yours...

1160
01:26:08.746 --> 01:26:10.080
...or not?

1161
01:26:11.958 --> 01:26:13.500
You bet your ass he is.

1162
01:26:14.377 --> 01:26:17.212
Well, l'm gonna find out
what happened here...

1163
01:26:17.589 --> 01:26:22.718
...even if it means putting your entire
department under federal review.

1164
01:26:25.221 --> 01:26:26.847
Nice work.

1165
01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:34.980
My office spent an hour talking
to West Covina...

1166
01:26:35.148 --> 01:26:36.857
...and the U.S. Attorney's Office...

1167
01:26:37.066 --> 01:26:39.776
...trying to find out just
who it is you're working for.

1168
01:26:40.028 --> 01:26:42.446
Now we know it's not the Bureau.

1169
01:26:42.614 --> 01:26:44.781
It's time that you
gave us an explanation.

1170
01:26:49.996 --> 01:26:51.496
I'm a federale.

1171
01:26:51.706 --> 01:26:52.748
A federale?

1172
01:26:53.917 --> 01:26:56.460
Look across that border.
What do you see?

1173
01:26:56.711 --> 01:27:00.005
That is the Democratic
Republic of Mexico.

1174
01:27:00.215 --> 01:27:01.632
-You're Mexican?
-That's right.

1175
01:27:01.799 --> 01:27:03.800
On my mother's father's side.

1176
01:27:04.010 --> 01:27:05.052
I can see it.

1177
01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:06.511
Glacias, thank you.

1178
01:27:06.721 --> 01:27:09.139
Gentlemen, l shouldn't be
telling y'all this.

1179
01:27:09.307 --> 01:27:10.891
I could lose my federale-hood.

1180
01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:13.560
-Your what?
-My federale-hood!

1181
01:27:14.812 --> 01:27:16.980
Look, l had to throw you guys off,
okay?

1182
01:27:17.273 --> 01:27:19.107
I was doing it for my country.

1183
01:27:19.317 --> 01:27:20.651
The red...

1184
01:27:21.152 --> 01:27:22.527
...the white...

1185
01:27:23.321 --> 01:27:24.404
...and the green.

1186
01:27:25.907 --> 01:27:29.034
If you'll excuse me,
I have to cross this border...

1187
01:27:29.244 --> 01:27:32.329
...and school some of my compadres,
you know...

1188
01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:36.250
...on things we like to talk about.
So y'all stay up. Be cool.

1189
01:27:44.550 --> 01:27:48.262
What's happening?
Hook a brother up with a taco!

1190
01:27:48.471 --> 01:27:50.055
A burrito!

1191
01:27:53.851 --> 01:27:58.146
I can't believe so much bad shit
can happen on such a beautiful day.

1192
01:28:02.819 --> 01:28:04.361
Yeah, what?

1193
01:28:04.737 --> 01:28:06.571
I think your Spanish is a little rusty.

1194
01:28:06.781 --> 01:28:10.200
You just told those men
you got a big cat in your pants.

1195
01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:17.374
That's a Latin thing. Macho.
You wouldn't understand.

1196
01:28:18.126 --> 01:28:20.585
No, I think l do understand...

1197
01:28:23.548 --> 01:28:24.548
...Logan.

1198
01:28:24.799 --> 01:28:25.841
What?

1199
01:28:28.845 --> 01:28:30.220
How'd you know it was me?

1200
01:28:30.388 --> 01:28:32.347
I started thinking if l was Logan...

1201
01:28:32.557 --> 01:28:36.893
...and had my diamond hidden
in a police building, what would I do?

1202
01:28:37.312 --> 01:28:38.895
So l thought like a crook.

1203
01:28:39.230 --> 01:28:40.731
Is that right?

1204
01:28:41.524 --> 01:28:42.691
I don't believe this.

1205
01:28:42.900 --> 01:28:44.860
He's a major felon.

1206
01:28:45.194 --> 01:28:47.696
This is one hell of a bust, Carlson.

1207
01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:51.116
It's a hell of a bust for us.

1208
01:28:53.202 --> 01:28:54.911
It's just too bad we can't make it.

1209
01:28:55.663 --> 01:28:56.913
Say what?

1210
01:28:57.248 --> 01:28:59.541
You heard the FBI.
They're extremely strict...

1211
01:28:59.751 --> 01:29:03.545
...about pursuing suspects
across international borders.

1212
01:29:04.422 --> 01:29:06.757
And you're just out of our jurisdiction.

1213
01:29:11.387 --> 01:29:12.512
You're...?

I guess this is the last time
I'm gonna see you boys.

1218
01:29:31.866 --> 01:29:34.409
But maybe we'll catch you later.

1219
01:29:34.786 --> 01:29:35.786
Is it like that?

1220
01:29:35.953 --> 01:29:37.454

01:29:48.549 --> 01:29:50.759
