1
00:02:02.873 --> 00:02:04.125
Moving on up.

2
00:02:04.292 --> 00:02:05.960
Believe that!

3
00:02:08.504 --> 00:02:11.465
Ladies, we got picture.
What about the alarm?

4
00:02:11.632 --> 00:02:13.634
Miles, what do you think
I'm doing over here?

5
00:02:13.843 --> 00:02:16.846
Just cool out. We like to run
a loose crew around here.

6
00:02:17.221 --> 00:02:18.472
You're the boss, Miles.

7
00:02:18.681 --> 00:02:19.890
It's like that?

8
00:02:20.057 --> 00:02:21.309
It's like that.

9
00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:24.520
I'm gonna go check on Tulley.

10
00:02:36.407 --> 00:02:38.659
<i>Tulley, we cool down there?</i>

11
00:02:40.494 --> 00:02:42.079
Yeah. Yeah, we're cool, man.

12
00:02:42.371 --> 00:02:43.414
<i>Good.</i>

13
00:02:43.581 --> 00:02:45.082
Cool is good.

14
00:02:45.583 --> 00:02:46.584
Are you smoking?

15
00:02:47.084 --> 00:02:48.544
No. Negative.

16
00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:52.048
You're lying, Tulley!
I smell the menthol up here, man!

17
00:02:52.465 --> 00:02:55.968
Now, cut it out. You're lying to me.
What would your mama do if she knew you were smoking, Tulley?

18
00:02:56.177 --> 00:02:57.845
<i>Cut it out, man!</i>

19
00:02:58.596 --> 00:03:00.514
Oh, shit.

20
00:03:00.681 --> 00:03:01.766
Stay alert.

21
00:03:02.725 --> 00:03:04.101
You ready over here?

22
00:03:09.774 --> 00:03:12.443
Damn it! Eddie, why you
gotta do that every time?

23
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.614
It's good luck.
It's bad luck if I land in it. Believe that.

24
00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:18.449
Don't fall in that shit.

25
00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:20.284
See you, Deke.

26
00:03:20.868 --> 00:03:22.411
Good luck, guys.

27
00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:56.404
<i>Deke, how's the weather
up there?</i>

28
00:03:56.612 --> 00:03:57.738
Snowing.

29
00:03:58.155 --> 00:04:01.242
It's beginning to look
a lot like Christmas.

30
00:04:30.938 --> 00:04:32.815
Miles, you got a guard
20 feet from you.

31
00:04:39.363 --> 00:04:40.990
Ten feet.
He's closing in fast.

32
00:04:42.283 --> 00:04:43.451
Right around the corner
from you.

33
00:05:24.033 --> 00:05:25.326
<i>He turned around.</i>

34
00:05:27.745 --> 00:05:28.871
Forget it. He's gone.

35
00:05:30.748 --> 00:05:32.917
So much for
the easy part. Kit.

36
00:05:34.543 --> 00:05:36.754
Oh, shit!
Blam!

37
00:05:37.004 --> 00:05:38.255
I hate it when you do that.

38
00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:39.924
All right.
Eddie, check this out.

39
00:05:40.132 --> 00:05:42.885
This is a Brigger 3300.
Toughest safe in the world.

40
00:05:43.177 --> 00:05:44.887
What's the first thing you do?
Drill the lock.

41
00:05:45.179 --> 00:05:47.598
No, you gotta check
to see if it's open.

42
00:05:48.432 --> 00:05:49.475
It's open!

43
00:05:50.434 --> 00:05:51.477
What?

44
00:05:51.936 --> 00:05:54.980
No, I'm messing... I'm messing with you.
They would never do that.

45
00:05:55.147 --> 00:05:56.982
Now, Eddie, you know
they would never do that.

46
00:06:28.764 --> 00:06:29.807
Glasses.

47
00:06:35.604 --> 00:06:37.815
I'll see you back up top.
- Right.

48
00:07:11.348 --> 00:07:12.850
Open sesame.

49
00:07:15.477 --> 00:07:16.520
Come on, Eddie.

50
00:07:17.354 --> 00:07:19.815
Got the rock?
Miles is right behind me.

51
00:07:20.441 --> 00:07:21.775
Eddie.

52
00:07:23.193 --> 00:07:25.446
Whoa.
What the hell you doing?

53
00:07:25.654 --> 00:07:27.323
Seventeen million
four ways?

54
00:07:27.489 --> 00:07:29.700
What?
I'm too greedy for that, Eddie.

55
00:07:29.867 --> 00:07:30.993
No, just come on, man!

56
00:07:41.545 --> 00:07:42.588
Shit!

57
00:07:58.771 --> 00:08:00.564
Come here, gorgeous.

58
00:08:03.484 --> 00:08:05.569
Got the rock. Time to roll.

59
00:08:05.736 --> 00:08:07.279
<i>Hurry up. We got a lot</i>

60
00:08:07.446 --> 00:08:09.198
of activity up here.
Now, hurry up. Let's go!

61
00:08:09.406 --> 00:08:10.407
Shit!

62
00:08:38.727 --> 00:08:39.770
Freeze!

63
00:08:47.945 --> 00:08:50.572
- Clear!
- Go, go!

64
00:08:51.907 --> 00:08:52.908
Let's go!

65
00:08:53.075 --> 00:08:54.660
Stay down!
You, stay down! Don't move!

66
00:08:54.827 --> 00:08:56.578
Let me see
your hands!

67
00:08:56.954 --> 00:08:58.205
Hey, Miles.

68
00:08:58.455 --> 00:09:00.374
Where's Eddie?
He went over already.

69
00:09:00.582 --> 00:09:01.792
You have the rock?
What?

70
00:09:01.959 --> 00:09:03.001
You got the rock?

71
00:09:03.168 --> 00:09:04.461
What you doing?
Give me the rock!

72
00:09:04.628 --> 00:09:06.088
Yo, Deke, you ain't
got to do this, man!

73
00:09:06.255 --> 00:09:08.048
Yes, I do. Give me the rock.
You want the rock?

74
00:09:08.215 --> 00:09:10.175
We're supposed to split this shit, man!
Why you doing this?

75
00:09:44.168 --> 00:09:45.210
Shit!

76
00:09:48.464 --> 00:09:51.341
Whoo-hoo!

77
00:10:02.019 --> 00:10:04.146
Miles, you're a dead man,
you piece of shit!

78
00:10:05.606 --> 00:10:06.899
Deke.

79
00:10:44.978 --> 00:10:46.313
Miles.

80
00:10:51.109 --> 00:10:52.653
Miles!

81
00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:11.922
Damn!

82
00:11:26.353 --> 00:11:28.480
Yes.

83
00:11:43.829 --> 00:11:45.622
Oh! Good doggie!

84
00:11:45.956 --> 00:11:47.374
Good doggie!

85
00:11:47.583 --> 00:11:50.127
Kibbles 'n Bits. Easy. Uh, uh...

86
00:11:50.294 --> 00:11:52.004
Where's the nearest exit?

87
00:11:52.713 --> 00:11:54.214
Stay where you are!
Hands up, man! Freeze!

88
00:11:54.381 --> 00:11:55.424
Turn around!
Turn around!

89
00:11:55.591 --> 00:11:58.635
I'm a carpenter!
I was working late!

90
00:12:00.053 --> 00:12:03.265
See? That's the saw.
See? I was working.

91
00:12:03.473 --> 00:12:06.143
You're under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent.

92
00:12:06.393 --> 00:12:09.146
Anything you say can and will
be used against you.

93
00:12:09.313 --> 00:12:13.150
You have the right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford one, one will be appointed for you.

94
00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.818
Do you understand
your rights?

95
00:12:15.485 --> 00:12:16.778
Do you understand
your rights?

96
00:12:16.945 --> 00:12:18.822
Yeah, I understand them.

97
00:12:52.898 --> 00:12:56.693
Ain't nothing but
a free thing, baby. Yeah!

98
00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:59.529
Ah. Free man. Believe that.

99
00:13:00.572 --> 00:13:02.074
One belt, one shoelace,

100
00:13:02.282 --> 00:13:04.368
one wallet
containing $22.

101
00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:05.994
One shoelace?

102
00:13:06.161 --> 00:13:09.373
Yo, man. You know how much them shoes cost?
One shoelace?

103
00:13:09.581 --> 00:13:11.375
I came in here with two.

104
00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:15.212
You took my shoelace?
Did you take my shoelace, man?

105
00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:18.674
You got two seconds
to walk out that door.

106
00:13:18.882 --> 00:13:19.925
Sign out

107
00:13:20.092 --> 00:13:21.718
and leave my pen.

108
00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:24.471
I'm signing out.

109
00:13:24.805 --> 00:13:27.182
I got places to go,
people to see.

110
00:13:27.474 --> 00:13:29.184
My lady, Janiece.

111
00:13:29.518 --> 00:13:31.937
Ass, ca-pow!

112
00:13:32.104 --> 00:13:33.313
It's like that.

113
00:13:33.522 --> 00:13:37.234
What you gonna do with one shoelace?
Let me in on the secret.

114
00:13:37.651 --> 00:13:39.361
Floss your ass?

115
00:13:40.028 --> 00:13:42.781
Gotta go. Hoo!

116
00:13:44.408 --> 00:13:47.202
Y'all stay up, man.
Don't be mad because I gotta go.

117
00:13:47.494 --> 00:13:51.123
Come on, open this fence.
Thanks. Yeah, I'm out of here.

118
00:13:51.289 --> 00:13:53.000
Oh, man.

119
00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:56.086
Where them butt-naked
hoes at? Do you know?

120
00:13:57.004 --> 00:13:58.755
Let me up
out of here.

121
00:13:58.922 --> 00:14:00.382
Yes!

122
00:14:02.134 --> 00:14:04.720
I'm free! I'm free at last!

123
00:14:05.387 --> 00:14:07.848
Gotta go! Gotta go, gotta go!

124
00:14:10.017 --> 00:14:11.351
I'm out of here!

125
00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.251
Damn!

126
00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:38.086
What happened?

127
00:14:38.795 --> 00:14:40.964
Did you eat the whole time
I was in there?

128
00:14:41.173 --> 00:14:44.217
I mean, when I left, you was like,
plickety-cau, plickety-cau.

129
00:14:44.384 --> 00:14:46.094
Now, you're like, what?-poom!

130
00:14:46.261 --> 00:14:49.389
And some Oprah shit. Wait a minute.
That's all right. I can adjust.

131
00:14:49.598 --> 00:14:53.310
It's the love that counts, you know what I mean?
I can adjust to a plus-size woman.

132
00:14:53.477 --> 00:14:55.353
Just more cushion
for the pushing.

133
00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:58.315
Janiece!

134
00:14:58.648 --> 00:15:01.193
Your sad-ass
sack of bones is here.

135
00:15:01.985 --> 00:15:04.613
I apologise. You're her cousin.
Mm-hm.

136
00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:06.031
I apol...
Can I buy you some cereal?

137
00:15:06.198 --> 00:15:07.949
Ugh!
- It's okay, Shawna.

138
00:15:08.575 --> 00:15:11.495
There you are.
Just hot!

139
00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:13.371
Miles.

140
00:15:14.122 --> 00:15:16.958
Wow. Baby, you are...

141
00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:19.294
You look beautiful.

142
00:15:19.711 --> 00:15:23.632
You are beautiful.
And that's not two years of prison talking.

143
00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.510
Baby, it must've been hard
in there for you.

144
00:15:26.802 --> 00:15:30.138
All alone at night
in your little cot.

145
00:15:30.472 --> 00:15:32.015
Tell me something, Miles.

146
00:15:32.974 --> 00:15:34.601
Did you think about me?

147
00:15:35.769 --> 00:15:37.813
Think about you all the time.

148
00:15:38.146 --> 00:15:40.190
Think about you right now.

149
00:15:40.774 --> 00:15:44.319
Then you should've thought about that
before you started robbing people!

150
00:15:45.153 --> 00:15:48.031
Janiece! I never robbed you!

151
00:15:48.198 --> 00:15:51.785
Janiece!
I'm a rehabilitated man!

152
00:15:52.202 --> 00:15:55.038
Janiece. Janiece!

153
00:15:56.623 --> 00:15:58.125
Talk to me.
Miles.

154
00:15:58.291 --> 00:16:01.211
I didn't come see you for two years.
Wasn't that a sign?

155
00:16:01.878 --> 00:16:04.047
I know you couldn't stand
to see your man like that.

156
00:16:04.381 --> 00:16:08.969
Man? You're not my man. You lie.
You told me you were a banker.

157
00:16:09.136 --> 00:16:12.347
No, bank robber. Yeah, see,
sometime I stutter.

158
00:16:12.556 --> 00:16:14.724
But... But I... I'm getting that whole
speech impediment thing...

159
00:16:14.891 --> 00:16:20.814
Miles. You are a very smart man,
but the entire time we spent together was one big lie.

160
00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:23.900
Look, Janiece. Listen to me, okay?

161
00:16:24.401 --> 00:16:27.070
I know I lied about some things,
but I can change.

162
00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.405
Oh, I don't think so.
No, Janie...

163
00:16:28.697 --> 00:16:32.284
Bye!
Don't do me like this!

164
00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:34.202
Oh!

165
00:16:49.593 --> 00:16:51.428
Fifth and Grand?

166
00:16:52.304 --> 00:16:54.347
"To protect and..."

167
00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:09.571
Hi. How you doing?
Is this really a police station?

168
00:17:09.821 --> 00:17:11.114
Of course.

169
00:17:51.238 --> 00:17:53.740
Hi. I have a delivery
for Traffic.

170
00:17:53.907 --> 00:17:56.159
Oh, yeah. Why don't you
sign by the X.

171
00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:03.083
What have we got?
Egg roll, orange chicken...

172
00:18:04.501 --> 00:18:07.420
Hot pizza coming through. Hot pizza!
Got to get the police officers their pizza.

173
00:18:07.671 --> 00:18:11.591
They got to protect and serve.
The police got to eat too!

174
00:18:11.841 --> 00:18:13.343
Let the officers eat, please.

175
00:18:13.593 --> 00:18:16.972
I'm the pizza man here
to deliver the pizza. Thank you.

176
00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.099
Officers, I got your pizzas!

177
00:18:20.684 --> 00:18:23.979
"Third Floor:
Robbery-Homicide."

178
00:18:26.481 --> 00:18:28.858
Yeah, please be careful.
Pizza's very hot.

179
00:18:29.025 --> 00:18:32.779
Don't want nobody to get hurt.
Just got here some pizza for you. Whoo!

180
00:18:32.988 --> 00:18:35.824
Pizza for you. That's how we do it
down at the pizza place.

181
00:18:36.449 --> 00:18:39.369
Watch it, watch it, watch it!
Ba-bow! Ba-bow!

182
00:18:39.536 --> 00:18:42.831
Two time, bring it up!
Don't drop the pizza!

183
00:18:45.375 --> 00:18:48.878
Whoa, whoa. Ooh! Uh...

184
00:18:49.045 --> 00:18:51.464
Pizza delivery for Robbery-Homicide.

185
00:18:51.965 --> 00:18:53.842
Robbery-Homicide?

186
00:18:54.384 --> 00:18:56.928
Why is it I don't see
Robbery-Homicide

187
00:18:57.137 --> 00:18:59.389
with a pizza delivery
in the log-in sheet?

188
00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:03.059
But I'll tell you what.
Why don't you just leave that pizza here with me?

189
00:19:03.226 --> 00:19:06.521
No, I'll tell you what.
Last time I left a pizza here,

190
00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:08.440
it magically
disappeared.

191
00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:11.443
I mean, it's just like
leaving candy around me.

192
00:19:11.693 --> 00:19:15.405
It's not gonna be all right.
I'm gonna chomp it up. See what I'm saying?

193
00:19:15.739 --> 00:19:17.991
Look.
There's two kinds of people that get through that door:

194
00:19:18.241 --> 00:19:20.869
People wearing handcuffs,
people wearing a badge.

195
00:19:21.077 --> 00:19:22.829
You don't have on either,
now, do you?

196
00:19:24.456 --> 00:19:27.250
Well, I don't have
a badge or handcuffs, so...

197
00:19:27.417 --> 00:19:29.044
Uh, Officer Carlson.

198
00:19:29.252 --> 00:19:33.214
We wanna flip that card right over.
Oh. Sorry. Just got it.

199
00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.258
Excuse me,
officer, officer.

200
00:19:36.259 --> 00:19:39.971
Um, the guys in Homicide ordered
this pizza about an hour ago.

201
00:19:40.138 --> 00:19:42.515
Okay.
And, um...

202
00:19:42.682 --> 00:19:45.268
I don't wanna leave them
with Shamu over there.

203
00:19:45.977 --> 00:19:48.563
Okay. Uh, sir, I'm not sure
what you want me to do.

204
00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:49.773
Take them!

205
00:19:49.939 --> 00:19:51.566
Sir, I'm on duty.
I'm afraid I can't do that.

206
00:19:51.733 --> 00:19:53.568
Yes, you can!
Please take that.

207
00:19:53.735 --> 00:19:54.944
Well, sir...

208
00:19:56.279 --> 00:19:57.781
Thank you very much!

209
00:20:01.076 --> 00:20:02.702
Break it down.

210
00:20:05.205 --> 00:20:06.790
Two time, left. Pow!

211
00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.209
One time. Break it down to the ground.

212
00:20:09.542 --> 00:20:10.585
Go here. Bow!

213
00:20:10.752 --> 00:20:13.088
Left leg. Pow! Bring it around.

214
00:20:14.798 --> 00:20:16.216
Walk.

215
00:20:23.807 --> 00:20:25.809
You hid a diamond
in the police station?

216
00:20:26.059 --> 00:20:29.562
I didn't know it was a police station.
Look, can you change the I.D. or not?

217
00:20:29.771 --> 00:20:33.983
Sure, but aren't they gonna be a little suspicious
of a pizza man with a security clearance?

218
00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:36.319
I'm not going back
as a pizza man.

219
00:20:36.569 --> 00:20:37.654
What are you going as?

220
00:20:37.904 --> 00:20:40.073
A cop.
A cop?

221
00:20:40.323 --> 00:20:41.366
A new transfer.

222
00:20:41.533 --> 00:20:45.161
That's why I need that ID
and a new file for detective.

223
00:20:45.787 --> 00:20:46.830
Why a detective?

224
00:20:47.038 --> 00:20:48.915
That's where the rock is.

225
00:20:49.082 --> 00:20:50.875
Oh, well...

226
00:20:51.793 --> 00:20:53.336
It's gonna be expensive.

227
00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:56.673
Uncle Lou,
I thought we was like family.

228
00:20:56.965 --> 00:20:59.634
Yeah, well, "like family"
is not family.

229
00:20:59.843 --> 00:21:03.179
If you were family,
you'd want it for free, right?

230
00:21:04.848 --> 00:21:07.684
Well, you ain't changed.
I'll see you later.

231
00:21:20.029 --> 00:21:21.322
Get down!

232
00:21:21.531 --> 00:21:23.950
Put some damn clothes on!
Get your butt-naked ass down!

233
00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.994
Get your
butt-naked ass down!

234
00:21:26.202 --> 00:21:29.581
He's butt-naked and he's stinking.
Oh! Somebody get him some clothes.

235
00:21:29.831 --> 00:21:31.583
He's hiding a gun in his ass!

236
00:21:34.043 --> 00:21:36.212
Get on the ground. Now.
That's it. Do it now.

237
00:21:36.463 --> 00:21:37.547
Don't I know you?

238
00:21:38.548 --> 00:21:40.633
Freeze! Cuff him!

239
00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.469
Yeah, cuff his ass.

240
00:21:42.677 --> 00:21:44.596
I'm gonna cuff you like that.

241
00:21:44.846 --> 00:21:47.974
All right? Now, I'm the good cop.
You act up, I'll turn into the bad one.

242
00:21:53.688 --> 00:21:55.356
Freeze! Get them up!

243
00:21:55.565 --> 00:21:57.192
Spread your legs now.

244
00:21:57.525 --> 00:21:59.819
I'm an officer of the law.

245
00:22:02.989 --> 00:22:04.199
Any sign of Deacon?

246
00:22:04.491 --> 00:22:07.660
Last I heard, he was pulling
rip jobs in Carson.

247
00:22:08.912 --> 00:22:11.664
I warned you about that guy.
That you did.

248
00:22:11.831 --> 00:22:13.541
He's gonna know you're out.

249
00:22:15.168 --> 00:22:17.378
This is purely cosmetic.
It won't check out.

250
00:22:17.587 --> 00:22:21.132
Don't worry. I'll be out of there
in an hour, max. Thanks.

251
00:22:21.299 --> 00:22:22.300
Good luck.

252
00:22:37.899 --> 00:22:39.234
Oh, oh!

253
00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.945
Hey there, officer dog.

254
00:22:42.403 --> 00:22:44.489
I'm a detective.
- Sorry, sir.

255
00:22:44.739 --> 00:22:45.865
She's never done that.

256
00:22:46.574 --> 00:22:48.368
Must be the pastrami.

257
00:22:48.785 --> 00:22:49.786
Bitch!

258
00:22:57.877 --> 00:22:58.920
Are you going up?

259
00:23:00.296 --> 00:23:02.674
Yeah, yeah.
Up. Third floor.

260
00:23:04.759 --> 00:23:06.302
Appreciate it.

261
00:23:21.317 --> 00:23:22.360
What?

262
00:23:22.819 --> 00:23:23.820
What?

263
00:23:49.262 --> 00:23:53.016
The vehicle belonged to your friend,
but you don't remember his name?

264
00:23:53.933 --> 00:23:55.310
Now, do you
have a last name?

265
00:23:56.019 --> 00:23:58.479
Oh, man. Damn, these cuffs
are tight, man!

266
00:23:58.896 --> 00:24:03.026
Miss Green. Miss Green,
could you please tell this man to loosen these cuffs?

267
00:24:11.826 --> 00:24:14.162
Man, I can't feel my fingers,
man. I'm serious. Please?

268
00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:16.039
I know it.
Detective.

269
00:24:16.664 --> 00:24:18.124
Not so tight.

270
00:24:19.375 --> 00:24:21.336
Maybe I could loosen them up a little bit.

271
00:24:21.502 --> 00:24:23.338
Okay.
Thank you.

272
00:24:28.509 --> 00:24:30.428
Hello?

273
00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:40.647
You got a great lawyer there.
Top of the line. Here you go.

274
00:25:00.249 --> 00:25:01.417
He's in here!

275
00:25:05.254 --> 00:25:06.297
Jesus!

276
00:25:07.256 --> 00:25:08.299
How y'all doing?

277
00:25:08.466 --> 00:25:10.426
Hey.
Oh, not again, Carlson!

278
00:25:10.677 --> 00:25:12.345
The guy
body-slammed me, sir.

279
00:25:12.595 --> 00:25:13.596
Maybe he likes you, Carlson.

280
00:25:13.846 --> 00:25:15.014
He did what to you?

281
00:25:15.264 --> 00:25:19.018
Get him out of here! What were
you thinking? Man, that's not smart!

282
00:25:19.352 --> 00:25:20.687
Get him out of here.

283
00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:23.231
Come on, come on.

284
00:25:23.398 --> 00:25:25.024
What the hell
happened up there?

285
00:25:26.025 --> 00:25:27.193
Up here?

286
00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:31.531
Oh, um,
I caught him trying to escape through the ventilation system.

287
00:25:31.698 --> 00:25:33.116
Who the hell are you?

288
00:25:33.408 --> 00:25:36.869
Oh. Uh, Malone.
Just transferred. Right there.

289
00:25:37.078 --> 00:25:39.038
Yeah, check that out. Bam!

290
00:25:39.247 --> 00:25:40.456
- Do you know Malone?
- No, sir.

291
00:25:40.623 --> 00:25:41.874
Nobody told me about it.

292
00:25:43.543 --> 00:25:44.752
Guys...

293
00:25:46.546 --> 00:25:48.840
Sorry, ma'am.
Excuse me.

294
00:25:49.006 --> 00:25:50.967
All right, clear it out!

295
00:25:51.134 --> 00:25:53.052
Let me flush, please.

296
00:25:56.472 --> 00:26:00.059
I didn't know.
You might not wanna go in there.

297
00:26:02.353 --> 00:26:04.856
You got some paperwork
for me there, Malone?

298
00:26:05.982 --> 00:26:08.985
You know, we've been putting in requests
for a new detective down here for 8 months.

299
00:26:09.152 --> 00:26:14.323
Suddenly, you just turn up.
I'll never understand the system. Downtown bumbledicks.

300
00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:17.785
Burglary, huh? Sixteen citations,
mayor's commendation.

301
00:26:18.453 --> 00:26:20.663
You worked
out of West Covina, huh?

302
00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.999
Yeah, well, that's what
it says right there.

303
00:26:23.791 --> 00:26:26.461
You look familiar, Malone.
Have we met before?

304
00:26:27.086 --> 00:26:28.838
No.

305
00:26:29.922 --> 00:26:32.800
You wouldn't happen to be
in a bowling league, would you?

306
00:26:34.969 --> 00:26:37.513
That's it. You're a bowler.

307
00:26:37.764 --> 00:26:40.558
I try.
Well, we could use a guy in Burglary.

308
00:26:40.725 --> 00:26:42.393
Carlson!

309
00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:43.895
Right here, yeah.

310
00:26:44.145 --> 00:26:48.649
Oh. I thought I was gonna be assigned to a desk.
Right up in here. Right up in here!

311
00:26:48.858 --> 00:26:49.984
Are you kidding me?

312
00:26:50.193 --> 00:26:53.321
A guy like you?
No, you belong on the street.

313
00:26:53.863 --> 00:26:54.864
And also, listen.

314
00:26:55.031 --> 00:26:58.910
Carlson needs a partner with some
experience. He just got promoted.

315
00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:00.620
Chief, I just got a call.

316
00:27:00.787 --> 00:27:04.207
Carlson, Malone's gonna be joining us.
So take him with you, show him around.

317
00:27:04.373 --> 00:27:08.044
And, Carlson, let Malone do
all the handcuffing, okay?

318
00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:11.047
I appreciate that, yeah.

319
00:27:11.672 --> 00:27:12.715
I'll be reviewing these.

320
00:27:14.383 --> 00:27:18.054
All right. Well, this is the bullpen here.
That's Booking up there.

321
00:27:18.304 --> 00:27:21.390
Then the holding cells are down that way.
You wanna see them?

322
00:27:21.682 --> 00:27:24.101
Seen one, seen them all.
Oh, yeah, okay, sure.

323
00:27:24.268 --> 00:27:25.645
This is my desk here, sir.

324
00:27:25.853 --> 00:27:27.230
Nice desk.

325
00:27:27.438 --> 00:27:29.565
Thanks. Let's see...

326
00:27:30.191 --> 00:27:31.317
Brass is on five.

327
00:27:31.526 --> 00:27:32.860
Robbery-Homicide on three.

328
00:27:33.069 --> 00:27:36.280
Over there,
that's the tag and bag. Sir? Sir?

329
00:27:36.447 --> 00:27:39.075
Through those doors, that's 10-17.
Roger.

330
00:27:39.242 --> 00:27:40.326
Carlson?
Yes, sir.

331
00:27:40.493 --> 00:27:41.828
Show him the rest later.
- Oh, yeah.

332
00:27:42.036 --> 00:27:43.579
Come on.
Uh, where?

333
00:27:43.871 --> 00:27:46.582
We got a call. Burglary.
It's ours. Here, I'll take this.

334
00:27:46.833 --> 00:27:49.126
You mean, like go outside?
Yeah, that's where all the crime is.

335
00:27:49.293 --> 00:27:51.921
No, no, no. See, I just got here,
and that's not a good thing.

336
00:27:52.171 --> 00:27:55.591
I gotta do work up in here so that I know what's going on up out there.

337
00:27:55.842 --> 00:27:57.468
I might need backup, right?

338
00:28:00.054 --> 00:28:01.764
So how long
you been in Burglary?

339
00:28:02.014 --> 00:28:04.600
Me? All my life, man, all my life.

340
00:28:04.851 --> 00:28:09.981
I mean, I heard the chief say that you got 16 citations.
That's incredible. Sixteen.

341
00:28:10.273 --> 00:28:13.526
That's what happens when
your Uncle Lou writes your file.

342
00:28:16.696 --> 00:28:19.115
You can ride up front
if you want.

343
00:28:20.867 --> 00:28:22.118
I knew that.

344
00:28:22.535 --> 00:28:26.080
You just gotta be real careful
for the pedestrians coming out here.

345
00:28:26.289 --> 00:28:27.957
Walking around out here.

346
00:28:28.791 --> 00:28:32.295
Am I clear to the right?
Am I clear? Have I got it?

347
00:28:34.088 --> 00:28:36.591
Yeah, I just made detective.

348
00:28:36.799 --> 00:28:38.801
No kidding.
Yeah.

349
00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:42.805
I worked Traffic for three years. You know,
it was pretty cool. I got pretty good at it.

350
00:28:45.641 --> 00:28:50.313
You know, you don't have to stop for the yellow.
You could just drive right through. It's all right.

351
00:28:50.521 --> 00:28:54.567
Sir, not if you'd seen some of the accidents I've seen.
No, thanks.

352
00:28:56.402 --> 00:28:58.571
Well, there's your green right there.

353
00:29:02.491 --> 00:29:04.118
Can I ask you a personal question?

354
00:29:04.327 --> 00:29:06.037
Yeah, sure.

355
00:29:06.662 --> 00:29:08.623
How many times
did you take the test?

356
00:29:09.916 --> 00:29:13.210
What test?
You know, the test for detective.

357
00:29:13.377 --> 00:29:15.463
Oh! Yeah, that one!

358
00:29:15.755 --> 00:29:17.006
One time.
Really?

359
00:29:17.173 --> 00:29:19.008
Yeah. Aced it.
Really?

360
00:29:19.842 --> 00:29:21.344
Took it out.
Wow.

361
00:29:21.552 --> 00:29:23.804
Took me five tries.

362
00:29:24.305 --> 00:29:28.309
I did really well on the written part, you know,
but my performance reviews weren't so hot.

363
00:29:28.517 --> 00:29:32.188
Hey, look.
How many times did it take you to get your driver's licence, man?

364
00:29:32.355 --> 00:29:35.149
Please!
Wake me up when we get there.

365
00:29:35.358 --> 00:29:37.109
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

366
00:29:37.318 --> 00:29:39.195
Goodness, man!

367
00:29:40.321 --> 00:29:42.657
It's a nice suit, sir.
It's really cool.

368
00:29:42.865 --> 00:29:44.533
Well, I appreciate it.

369
00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:46.702
Yeah, you know? Appreciate it.

370
00:29:46.994 --> 00:29:49.622
Got any music?
Oh, yeah. Sure.

371
00:29:50.414 --> 00:29:51.457
I like to jam.

372
00:29:53.209 --> 00:29:55.378
Just so long as
we can hear the dispatcher.

373
00:29:56.212 --> 00:29:57.630
That's good.

374
00:29:58.381 --> 00:30:01.759
I never heard this station before.
Kind of funky. You like that?

375
00:30:13.104 --> 00:30:17.525
Last night these shelves were loaded with Elites.
Just came in yesterday. Now they're gone.

376
00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:19.402
Three dozen
gorgeous rims.

377
00:30:19.652 --> 00:30:20.820
They didn't take
anything else?

378
00:30:20.987 --> 00:30:25.533
No, they went for my good stuff.
Chrome with gold trim. Five grand worth.

379
00:30:26.534 --> 00:30:27.660
What about the alarm?

380
00:30:27.868 --> 00:30:29.745
What about it?
It went off.

381
00:30:29.912 --> 00:30:32.081
But it took you guys
two hours to get here.

382
00:30:32.248 --> 00:30:34.500
My wheels are probably rolling around Tijuana right about now.

383
00:30:34.709 --> 00:30:36.252
Here. Here's where
they came in.

384
00:30:37.586 --> 00:30:40.589
Looks like they just, you know,
broke the glass, opened the handle,

385
00:30:40.756 --> 00:30:42.091
crawled in the window.

386
00:30:42.341 --> 00:30:43.384
Exactly.

387
00:30:43.592 --> 00:30:44.802
Shimmied down the shelf
or something.

388
00:30:44.969 --> 00:30:46.929
Carlson, this is
a waste of time.

389
00:30:47.138 --> 00:30:48.764
What?
That's not how they got in.

390
00:30:49.265 --> 00:30:50.558
Of course it is.

391
00:30:50.891 --> 00:30:52.893
No, cut it out, Frankie.
That's not how they got in.

392
00:30:53.144 --> 00:30:54.270
This is the spot here.

393
00:30:54.437 --> 00:30:56.272
That's how I would've came in.

394
00:30:56.939 --> 00:30:58.774
No, no, no.
If I was a thief.

395
00:30:59.025 --> 00:31:00.776
If I was a thief!

396
00:31:00.943 --> 00:31:03.946
Skylight. Just cut the alarm
from the inside.

397
00:31:04.155 --> 00:31:05.948
I could take my time.

398
00:31:06.157 --> 00:31:07.199
Why take your time?

399
00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:09.243
Why would I take my time?

400
00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:15.374
It's heavy.

401
00:31:16.292 --> 00:31:17.793
Now, you tell me.

402
00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:20.129
How long would it take for you
to carry three dozen of those

403
00:31:20.296 --> 00:31:22.757
out of the store and load them in the back of a truck?

404
00:31:22.923 --> 00:31:23.924
Long time.

405
00:31:24.091 --> 00:31:25.760
It would take a long time.
A very long time.

406
00:31:25.968 --> 00:31:29.430
Yeah, but they probably had about three
or four guys working the damn thing...

407
00:31:29.638 --> 00:31:31.974
Zip! Zip the shit up! Frank, hush.

408
00:31:32.308 --> 00:31:34.477
Okay? Because
you know better. Come on.

409
00:31:34.727 --> 00:31:38.606
Don't lie to me. I'm the man.
I'm the man, Frank.

410
00:31:38.814 --> 00:31:40.649
You're the man.
Frank,

411
00:31:40.816 --> 00:31:45.321
your 5000, sorry to tell you,
is worth less than 2 on the street.

412
00:31:45.571 --> 00:31:48.908
Which don't go four ways with much juice once you rent a truck.

413
00:31:49.492 --> 00:31:53.204
And to rent a truck,
that requires what?

414
00:31:53.996 --> 00:31:55.498
Credit card,

415
00:31:56.207 --> 00:31:58.334
driver's licence.

416
00:31:59.251 --> 00:32:00.836
Unless, of course...

417
00:32:01.837 --> 00:32:03.339
you got your own truck.

418
00:32:05.424 --> 00:32:07.468
He's not gonna let us search his truck.

419
00:32:07.676 --> 00:32:10.513
What you mean, "let us"?
We the police.

420
00:32:10.721 --> 00:32:12.515
Detective, we need
a warrant to do that.

421
00:32:12.765 --> 00:32:14.809
We don't even need a key.

422
00:32:16.769 --> 00:32:19.480
Detective, you can't do that.
It's unconstitutional.

423
00:32:20.272 --> 00:32:23.442
Look at that. Look at this.

424
00:32:27.154 --> 00:32:31.117
Look at that. Solved the crime
my first day on the job!

425
00:32:31.325 --> 00:32:33.619
We bad detectives.
There they are!

426
00:32:33.786 --> 00:32:36.580
Sir, filing a false report
is a very serious crime.

427
00:32:36.747 --> 00:32:39.125
Whoa. No, uh...

428
00:32:41.043 --> 00:32:44.630
I'll handle this. Bring your
weeble-wobble ass on over here.

429
00:32:46.882 --> 00:32:49.635
You like snacks?
Yeah. Nothing makes me happier.

430
00:32:49.844 --> 00:32:53.472
Yeah? Well, you're gonna be snacking on the
bottom of this shoe if this shit happens again.

431
00:32:53.681 --> 00:32:55.224
Now, you see them ridges?
Yeah.

432
00:32:55.391 --> 00:32:58.394
These ridges are gonna be imprinted on the back of your ass,

433
00:32:58.686 --> 00:33:01.147
permanently,
if this happens again.

434
00:33:01.355 --> 00:33:02.398
You understand?

435
00:33:02.565 --> 00:33:04.150
Thoroughly understand you.
That's right.

436
00:33:04.316 --> 00:33:07.820
Every time you look at your ass
there's gonna be a print there.

437
00:33:08.028 --> 00:33:09.822
It's gonna remind you of me
and my partner.

438
00:33:10.531 --> 00:33:12.158
And of you lying.
- Right.

439
00:33:12.658 --> 00:33:14.076
Don't wanna see those ridges.
All right. Hey, listen.

440
00:33:14.368 --> 00:33:17.621
Stop eating cold cuts, because it's seeping,
it's coming through your pores.

441
00:33:17.788 --> 00:33:20.166
All right?
Okay. Will do.

442
00:33:20.416 --> 00:33:23.002
I'll put one ridge
on your ass.

443
00:33:23.502 --> 00:33:26.922
Let's roll. That's cool.
Let's get out of here.

444
00:33:28.257 --> 00:33:31.385
Uh, yeah.
Detective, I know I'm a little bit new at this,

445
00:33:31.594 --> 00:33:33.846
but I thought we were supposed to arrest the bad guys.

446
00:33:34.013 --> 00:33:36.557
No. Now he owes us one.

447
00:33:36.765 --> 00:33:38.100
So that's how it works.

448
00:33:38.517 --> 00:33:41.979
We let the little fish go, so that
we can catch the big fish later.

449
00:33:42.146 --> 00:33:44.106
Mm-hm.
I got it. I got it.

450
00:33:44.273 --> 00:33:46.066
Yeah.

451
00:33:47.359 --> 00:33:49.778
You mind if I drive?
I know a shortcut.

452
00:33:49.945 --> 00:33:51.822
Uh, yeah.

453
00:33:54.742 --> 00:33:56.076
You might wanna buckle up.

454
00:34:04.585 --> 00:34:07.254
Are you in a hurry, sir?
No.

455
00:34:07.463 --> 00:34:10.549
Just testing your car.
Balancing out your shit.

456
00:34:12.885 --> 00:34:15.387
When was the last time
you got all up on this thing?

457
00:34:15.638 --> 00:34:18.057
I've never gotten all up
on anything, sir.

458
00:34:19.266 --> 00:34:22.478
Yeah, well,
sometimes you gotta feed some speed to your ride every once in a while.

459
00:34:25.147 --> 00:34:28.108
Sir! Watch it! Watch it!

460
00:34:30.986 --> 00:34:33.906
Hey! This is the police!
Move your busted-ass vehicle!

461
00:34:34.406 --> 00:34:36.283
Move, move, move,
move, move!

462
00:34:36.492 --> 00:34:38.077
This is the LAPD.

463
00:34:38.285 --> 00:34:39.787
We'll pop one in your ass.

464
00:34:39.995 --> 00:34:41.914
We got guns and shit.

465
00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:44.625
I could get used to this!

466
00:34:45.334 --> 00:34:47.878
I like! I like!

467
00:34:48.087 --> 00:34:49.255
Used to what?

468
00:34:52.174 --> 00:34:55.636
Driving. See, my last partner
did all the driving.

469
00:34:56.178 --> 00:34:57.888
Who was your partner?

470
00:34:59.431 --> 00:35:01.141
I don't wanna talk about it.

471
00:35:01.642 --> 00:35:02.685
Why?

472
00:35:03.102 --> 00:35:07.815
Hey, look, man, I'm deep, okay?
There's just some places I can't talk about. You wouldn't understand.

473
00:35:08.023 --> 00:35:11.694
If we're gonna be partners, we gotta communicate.
This thing's like a marriage.

474
00:35:11.944 --> 00:35:14.196
No, this is nothing like a marriage.

475
00:35:14.697 --> 00:35:17.491
What is it like?
It's more like a one-night stand.

476
00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:20.452
Wham, bam, thank you, officer.

477
00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:27.209
It's like that?
Oh, it's like that.

478
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:31.213
We're just gonna fight crime
and zip the rest of that shit up.

479
00:35:31.463 --> 00:35:32.881
Are you married?
No.

480
00:35:33.132 --> 00:35:34.550
Girlfriend?
Not anymore.

481
00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:35.843
What happened?

482
00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:40.014
Work got in the way.

483
00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:42.182
Okay. See?

484
00:35:47.354 --> 00:35:49.231
Looks like somebody
took out a fire hydrant, sir.

485
00:35:55.821 --> 00:35:58.657
I'll handle this.
I gotta get back. I got a headache.

486
00:35:58.824 --> 00:36:00.868
We're on duty, you know?
We'll get back when we get back.

487
00:36:01.076 --> 00:36:05.080
But I need an aspirin.
A big one, like a hockey puck.

488
00:36:05.247 --> 00:36:06.749
Gentlemen. Excuse me.

489
00:36:06.999 --> 00:36:09.001
Could you come here
for a second?

490
00:36:09.168 --> 00:36:11.712
Sir, sir. Relax, sir.
Just take it easy for a second.

491
00:36:19.511 --> 00:36:21.096
Morning, officer.

492
00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:24.224
Oh. Yeah.

493
00:36:24.391 --> 00:36:26.101
Morning. Where's your aspirins?

494
00:36:26.352 --> 00:36:28.228
Back there by the soda machines.

495
00:36:28.604 --> 00:36:29.605
Appreciate it.

496
00:36:39.114 --> 00:36:42.242
So you're coming east.
I wanna know how the car hit the fire hydrant.

497
00:36:44.119 --> 00:36:46.038
Open the register!
Don't shoot!

498
00:36:46.288 --> 00:36:47.289
Come on, man!

499
00:36:47.623 --> 00:36:50.042
Oh, man!
- Come on! The safe too!

500
00:36:58.467 --> 00:36:59.468
Come on.

501
00:37:05.516 --> 00:37:09.311
37-King-5.
Shots fired. Request help.

502
00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:12.064
418 West Fifth Street.

503
00:37:19.238 --> 00:37:20.280
Detective Malone!

504
00:37:20.489 --> 00:37:21.573
You okay?

505
00:37:21.824 --> 00:37:22.825
Oh, shit!

506
00:37:25.619 --> 00:37:27.913
Get back! Back! Get back!

507
00:37:28.122 --> 00:37:29.164
Time out, time out.

508
00:37:30.499 --> 00:37:31.667
All right, I'm leaving.

509
00:37:32.167 --> 00:37:33.669
I don't want no... Oh.
Freeze!

510
00:37:33.919 --> 00:37:36.046
Put your hands on the pavement!

511
00:37:36.255 --> 00:37:38.841
Put your hands on the pavement!
There is no pavement!

512
00:37:39.591 --> 00:37:41.343
Well, then put them
on the Oodles of Noodles.

513
00:37:41.593 --> 00:37:43.595
Put them on the noodles.
Chicken or beef?

514
00:37:43.804 --> 00:37:44.847
Chicken.

515
00:37:46.306 --> 00:37:48.475
Cool. Cool is good.

516
00:37:48.642 --> 00:37:50.894
Hold on. Miles?

517
00:37:51.186 --> 00:37:52.229
Tulley?

518
00:37:56.650 --> 00:37:58.110
Nigga, what are you doing?

519
00:37:58.277 --> 00:38:00.529
What do you mean, what the hell am I doing here?
What are you doing here?

520
00:38:00.696 --> 00:38:02.698
I'm freaking working over here.
- Detective Malone!

521
00:38:02.865 --> 00:38:04.283
Shh! Shh!
- What?

522
00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:05.951
I'm coming in!

523
00:38:06.201 --> 00:38:07.870
Put the gun down!

524
00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:09.288
Put the gun down!

525
00:38:09.496 --> 00:38:10.998
Detective Malone, talk to me!

526
00:38:11.206 --> 00:38:12.875
Go out the back way!
Go! Go!

527
00:38:13.125 --> 00:38:14.877
Go! The back way!
All right. Huh?

528
00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:16.879
Go out the back way!

529
00:38:17.796 --> 00:38:18.839
Detective, talk to me!

530
00:38:20.674 --> 00:38:21.884
Take two steps back!

531
00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:24.595
What the hell? Go!

532
00:38:26.221 --> 00:38:27.222
Hold it!

533
00:38:29.725 --> 00:38:30.809
Hold your fire!

534
00:38:34.188 --> 00:38:35.731
You okay?
Yeah, yeah!

535
00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:01.590
Listen, it's a dead end, all right?

536
00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:03.509
No shit!

537
00:39:08.639 --> 00:39:12.184
He's down behind those Dumpsters.
He's freaking out, sir. He's got a gun.

538
00:39:15.187 --> 00:39:16.230
Back up!

539
00:39:17.439 --> 00:39:20.442
Get SWAT up here! Sharpshooters
can take him off from the roof.

540
00:39:20.609 --> 00:39:21.902
No!

541
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:23.612
No sharpshooters.

542
00:39:24.071 --> 00:39:25.113
Why the hell not?

543
00:39:26.865 --> 00:39:28.367
Miles, what are you
doing here, man?

544
00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:30.702
Who's he talking to?
I don't know.

545
00:39:31.161 --> 00:39:34.164
He high, man. He's hallucinating.
Smoking that shit!

546
00:39:34.581 --> 00:39:36.291
He's high.

547
00:39:36.959 --> 00:39:38.710
Put down the gun and come out!

548
00:39:41.755 --> 00:39:43.799
Hold this. Hold on.
I'm going in.

549
00:39:44.132 --> 00:39:45.133
What are you doing?

550
00:39:45.759 --> 00:39:47.135
What are you, crazy?

551
00:39:49.596 --> 00:39:51.306
Miles, what are you
doing here, man?

552
00:39:51.765 --> 00:39:53.767
I just wanna talk to you
before somebody gets hurt!

553
00:39:53.934 --> 00:39:56.645
Go away!
Now, sir, please put down the gun!

554
00:39:56.895 --> 00:39:58.564
Son, come on.
Shut up!

555
00:39:58.772 --> 00:39:59.982
It hurts my heart
Shut up!

556
00:40:00.232 --> 00:40:02.901
To see a kid that has
so much potential.

557
00:40:03.151 --> 00:40:05.279
You're smarter than that.
I'm coming out!

558
00:40:06.321 --> 00:40:10.075
Hold it. Now, listen, man. All right, now,
goddamn it! What are you doing?

559
00:40:10.325 --> 00:40:13.453
What the hell are you doing?
You got me out here in this shit.

560
00:40:13.662 --> 00:40:15.747
How many times I told you?
How many times I told you,

561
00:40:15.998 --> 00:40:20.085
forget the safe? Go straight for the cash drawer.
Get in and get out.

562
00:40:21.003 --> 00:40:23.338
Oh, great. He's standing in the way.
Now I can't even get a shot.

563
00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:24.840
I can't either.

564
00:40:25.132 --> 00:40:27.301
Why are you hitting
mom-and-pop stores anyway?

565
00:40:27.509 --> 00:40:29.511
Look, you're a driver, man.

566
00:40:29.761 --> 00:40:33.807
You got skills. You can be out there
on the road, man, doing your shit.

567
00:40:34.016 --> 00:40:38.020
I'm desperate! Because I need some money too!
And why the freak are we whispering?

568
00:40:39.938 --> 00:40:42.357
Back up, nigger! I saw you!

569
00:40:44.359 --> 00:40:46.737
What are they talking about?
I don't know.

570
00:40:47.029 --> 00:40:50.824
Look, Tulley. I'm working on something here,
and you're blowing it for me, man!

571
00:40:51.533 --> 00:40:53.493
I'm sorry, man. I'm messing up.

572
00:40:53.744 --> 00:40:55.829
I'm messing up.
It's all right. It's all right.

573
00:40:56.038 --> 00:40:57.706
Look, I'm not mad at you.

574
00:40:58.290 --> 00:41:02.294
I'm not mad at you.
But you're gonna have to give me the gun and let me arrest you.

575
00:41:02.794 --> 00:41:04.046
No.

576
00:41:04.212 --> 00:41:08.634
Come on, man. Listen. I'll give you 10 grand.
You know I'm good for it.

577
00:41:09.134 --> 00:41:11.553
Mm. I'm thinking
like 50, man.

578
00:41:11.803 --> 00:41:15.307
Tulley, 50?
That's pushing it, man! Damn!

579
00:41:15.515 --> 00:41:19.394
All right, 20, okay? And you'll spend one night in jail.
Now, Tulley, that's the best I can do.

580
00:41:19.645 --> 00:41:21.563
That's it. Best I can do.

581
00:41:23.065 --> 00:41:25.567
All right, fine.
But I'm keeping my gun.

582
00:41:25.817 --> 00:41:29.821
You cannot let me arrest you
and keep the gun, man. Come on.

583
00:41:30.072 --> 00:41:32.699
Damn, I just got this, man.
This is hard to find.

584
00:41:32.908 --> 00:41:36.870
It's hard to find. But, damn it,
you're gonna have to give up the gun. Now, what you wanna do?

585
00:41:37.079 --> 00:41:41.667
Okay? You wanna give up the gun or you want to
have them put about six or seven bullets in your ass?

586
00:41:44.002 --> 00:41:45.587
Okay, now give me that gun!

587
00:41:46.088 --> 00:41:47.422
No.

588
00:41:47.923 --> 00:41:50.092
Don't just hand it to me.

589
00:41:50.384 --> 00:41:53.387
I gotta take it from you.
They're watching.

590
00:41:53.887 --> 00:41:55.764
All right, all right.
Yeah.

591
00:41:55.931 --> 00:41:57.432
Now, this is gonna
hurt a little bit.

592
00:41:57.599 --> 00:41:59.434
Huh?
I say, this is gonna hurt a little bit.

593
00:41:59.601 --> 00:42:01.311
Okay. Oh!

594
00:42:03.188 --> 00:42:04.314
Jesus!

595
00:42:04.564 --> 00:42:06.441
That's incredible!

596
00:42:07.025 --> 00:42:09.820
You don't know me anymore.

597
00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:11.530
I sure don't.

598
00:42:11.738 --> 00:42:13.448
You didn't use to be so violent.

599
00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:15.784
So he's like,
"Carlson, take my jacket."

600
00:42:15.951 --> 00:42:19.329
He steps out, he's like, "I got to do this."
We're like, "What are you doing, sir?"

601
00:42:19.538 --> 00:42:22.874
He's like, "Believe that."
He just goes right down the alley, right up to the guy.

602
00:42:23.125 --> 00:42:25.711
Next thing you know,
he's taking the guy's gun.

603
00:42:25.919 --> 00:42:28.964
Dropped the guy with a punch.
Just levelled him.

604
00:42:29.214 --> 00:42:31.133
I mean, blink and
you would've missed it.

605
00:42:31.299 --> 00:42:34.344
Malone! Malone, in my office!

606
00:42:34.594 --> 00:42:36.054
Now!

607
00:42:40.142 --> 00:42:41.393
Not you, Carlson.

608
00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:48.483
I've been looking
through your record.

609
00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:50.569
How come I never
heard of you, Malone?

610
00:42:51.278 --> 00:42:53.655
I was undercover. On the down low.

611
00:42:53.864 --> 00:42:57.284
We need a new guy to head up Burglary.
That's the real reason you're here, isn't it?

612
00:42:58.785 --> 00:43:00.746
Yeah, sure.
It's no secret.

613
00:43:00.912 --> 00:43:05.667
Burglary's been a problem division ever
since we lost our lead detective last year.

614
00:43:06.001 --> 00:43:08.670
Now, usually we promote
from within the ranks,

615
00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:10.839
but I think these guys
need someone new.

616
00:43:11.089 --> 00:43:13.383
So if you want the job,
you got it.

617
00:43:16.261 --> 00:43:17.304
Excuse me?

618
00:43:17.637 --> 00:43:20.265
You're the new lead detective.
Burglary Division.

619
00:43:22.809 --> 00:43:25.312
Me?
Well...

620
00:43:26.271 --> 00:43:30.692
Technically, there's a 30-day qualifying
period before I can "make it official,"

621
00:43:30.901 --> 00:43:34.196
but with your record I don't think
there's gonna be any problem.

622
00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:40.535
Well, say something,
for christ sake!

623
00:43:42.871 --> 00:43:44.456
Thank you.

624
00:43:44.706 --> 00:43:46.166
Let's party?

625
00:43:49.044 --> 00:43:50.712
What is this? High school?

626
00:43:50.962 --> 00:43:56.051
All right, listen up. As of now,
Detective Malone is Burglary's new acting lead detective.

627
00:43:56.384 --> 00:43:58.804
Get these processed ASAP.
Yes, sir!

628
00:43:59.930 --> 00:44:01.389
Thank you.

629
00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:03.183
Carlson, Carlson.
Look.

630
00:44:03.350 --> 00:44:05.560
I got some things I gotta do.
I'll catch up with you later.

631
00:44:05.727 --> 00:44:07.229
Okay.

632
00:44:07.395 --> 00:44:08.647
I'll take these.

633
00:44:08.855 --> 00:44:10.732
You know what to do with these?
Sure, I do.

634
00:44:10.982 --> 00:44:12.400
Okay, great, sir. Sorry.

635
00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:24.579
Captain Penelli?
I'm busy right now.

636
00:44:36.091 --> 00:44:37.843
Oh.

637
00:44:41.054 --> 00:44:42.848
Oh, man!

638
00:45:03.368 --> 00:45:04.953
Shit!

639
00:45:07.122 --> 00:45:08.498
Damn!

640
00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:22.178
Malone.
What? Yeah. What?

641
00:45:22.345 --> 00:45:24.055
So how do you want me
to handle the rotation?

642
00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:27.267
Rotation. I don't understand.
What you mean, "rotation"?

643
00:45:27.475 --> 00:45:29.144
The shifts.

644
00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:34.024
Look, Hardcastle,
I can't figure out everything on the first day, all right?

645
00:45:34.232 --> 00:45:37.068
I was noticing that you guys had a leak up here.
What's that about?

646
00:45:37.277 --> 00:45:39.988
One of the hot-water pipes burst,
flooded all the vents.

647
00:45:40.155 --> 00:45:41.531
Vents?

648
00:45:41.698 --> 00:45:43.783
They had to flush out the whole system.
Big pain in the ass.

649
00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:46.411
This must be the new guy
everybody's talking about.

650
00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:48.538
Captain Penelli,
Detective Malone.

651
00:45:48.747 --> 00:45:50.081
Malone, Penelli.

652
00:45:50.999 --> 00:45:54.961
I hear great things.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

653
00:46:00.842 --> 00:46:02.677
Nice to meet you too there, sir!

654
00:46:02.928 --> 00:46:04.346
Very nice to meet you!

655
00:46:05.847 --> 00:46:07.098
Glad to be here.

656
00:46:07.349 --> 00:46:08.767
Gotta go!

657
00:46:12.562 --> 00:46:15.690
He's a strange one.
Oh, yeah.

658
00:46:29.871 --> 00:46:31.706
Place is closed.

659
00:46:32.707 --> 00:46:35.585
I said we're closed.
I should've locked up.

660
00:46:36.211 --> 00:46:37.587
Nice to see you, Lou.

661
00:46:38.797 --> 00:46:40.465
I'm looking for Miles.

662
00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:42.884
Well, I haven't seen him.

663
00:46:43.134 --> 00:46:45.637
See, I got this message from his mother.
It's really important.

664
00:46:47.639 --> 00:46:49.599
Well, I still haven't seen him.

665
00:46:51.851 --> 00:46:53.061
Shh. Be quiet.

666
00:46:58.692 --> 00:47:00.235
Damn, you're good.

667
00:47:05.615 --> 00:47:07.075
You are good.

668
00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:51.786
Good morning. Listen up.

669
00:47:51.953 --> 00:47:56.041
Word is that Jean LaFleur is bringing a
big shipment of heroin through town.

670
00:47:58.376 --> 00:47:59.878
They want him in San Diego.

671
00:48:00.086 --> 00:48:02.130
San Diego's P.D.'s done
an excellent job

672
00:48:02.422 --> 00:48:05.467
shutting down the harbour
and the airports on him.

673
00:48:12.057 --> 00:48:13.641
Malone!

674
00:48:13.808 --> 00:48:18.313
Detective Malone just transferred from West Covina.
He's gonna be heading up our Burglary Division.

675
00:48:19.314 --> 00:48:20.607
Detective,

676
00:48:20.815 --> 00:48:22.984
tell us a little about your plans.

677
00:48:25.153 --> 00:48:27.906
Well, I plan to fight crime.

678
00:48:33.453 --> 00:48:34.829
You know, shit like that.

679
00:48:34.996 --> 00:48:36.831
Great, then. Great.

680
00:48:37.332 --> 00:48:39.501
All right. Does anybody have
any questions for Detective Malone?

681
00:48:39.709 --> 00:48:41.419
Yeah, I got a question.

682
00:48:41.669 --> 00:48:43.588
What do you think about the P-31?

683
00:48:44.964 --> 00:48:46.508
P-31.

684
00:48:48.676 --> 00:48:51.012
What do you think?
I think it's a piece of shit.

685
00:48:51.179 --> 00:48:52.597
Diaz.

686
00:48:53.098 --> 00:48:57.018
What I mean to say is,
we've all been having problems with the P-31, right?

687
00:48:57.227 --> 00:49:01.856
I'm just wondering what the new lead
detective here plans to do about it.

688
00:49:02.273 --> 00:49:05.652
Well, all right.
Well, Diaz, is it? Diaz?

689
00:49:05.985 --> 00:49:09.114
What do you think we should do
about it, Diaz?

690
00:49:09.489 --> 00:49:11.032
I think we should scrap it.

691
00:49:11.741 --> 00:49:14.828
How many people think
we should scrap the P-31?

692
00:49:17.372 --> 00:49:18.540
There it is.

693
00:49:18.748 --> 00:49:20.792
Scrapped. You know why?
Because you want it scrapped.

694
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.629
It's out of there. P-31, out of there.
No more. Gone.

695
00:49:25.004 --> 00:49:27.006
You want 31 flavours?

696
00:49:27.215 --> 00:49:30.385
Baskin-Robbins is
where you wanna be. Be cool.

697
00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:32.137
That's my partner.
- Oh, yeah?

698
00:49:32.303 --> 00:49:34.013
Yeah.
Detective.

699
00:49:37.058 --> 00:49:38.893
What is it?

700
00:49:39.144 --> 00:49:40.770
I'd like to work with a P-40.

701
00:49:40.979 --> 00:49:42.147
Yeah, the P-40's good.

702
00:49:43.898 --> 00:49:45.400
P-40 it is!

703
00:49:50.029 --> 00:49:52.073
What the hell's he doing?
We just got those things.

704
00:49:52.323 --> 00:49:55.577
He's shaking things up.
Maybe that's exactly what we need.

705
00:50:13.303 --> 00:50:14.929
I'm not a cop.
- Malone.

706
00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:17.932
This Tulley asshole has been screaming he wants to talk to you.

707
00:50:18.183 --> 00:50:19.934
He's down
in Interrogation.

708
00:50:20.977 --> 00:50:22.770
Okay. Right away.
I'll talk with him.

709
00:50:24.606 --> 00:50:26.399
Interrogation's this way.

710
00:50:26.608 --> 00:50:28.943
Knew that. Is he running his mouth?

711
00:50:29.861 --> 00:50:32.947
Tulley says he has information
about another robbery.

712
00:50:33.114 --> 00:50:35.909
But he says he'll only talk
to the officer who arrested him.

713
00:50:36.367 --> 00:50:39.621
Okay. Well,
I'll talk to him. Alone.

714
00:50:39.829 --> 00:50:41.456
We'll be watching.

715
00:50:43.625 --> 00:50:47.086
What the hell's going on, man?
You said I'd spend one night in jail.

716
00:50:58.097 --> 00:51:00.642
What do you wanna tell me?
What is it?

717
00:51:00.892 --> 00:51:02.977
You said I'd only spend
one night in jail.

718
00:51:03.144 --> 00:51:04.896
It's only been one night.

719
00:51:05.104 --> 00:51:06.981
Well, where's my 50 grand?

720
00:51:07.315 --> 00:51:09.108
I said 20 grand.

721
00:51:09.609 --> 00:51:11.736
Well, maybe it's 50 now! Because...

722
00:51:16.074 --> 00:51:19.661
Detectives, I've been assigned
to Mr. Tulley.

723
00:51:19.911 --> 00:51:22.413
Well, great. That's him.

724
00:51:22.622 --> 00:51:25.583
Oh, my God!
What in the world?

725
00:51:25.792 --> 00:51:27.293
- Help me!
- What's going on?

726
00:51:28.503 --> 00:51:30.838
Help!
What is this?

727
00:51:34.592 --> 00:51:36.302
Oh, my God.

728
00:51:40.515 --> 00:51:43.434
Take your hands off my client!

729
00:51:44.352 --> 00:51:45.895
It's no use. He ain't talking!

730
00:51:46.104 --> 00:51:48.022
That's because you have
your hand over his mouth!

731
00:51:54.028 --> 00:51:57.865
I think we accomplished
enough for one day.

732
00:51:58.199 --> 00:52:01.536
Now, wait a second.
This guy said he has information on another case.

733
00:52:01.828 --> 00:52:04.205
I wanna know, are you jerking
our chain or not?

734
00:52:04.414 --> 00:52:06.207
I'm not jerking your chain, fella.

735
00:52:06.416 --> 00:52:10.545
This guy Logan owes me
50 thousand dollars.

736
00:52:11.379 --> 00:52:14.465
If I don't get it soon,
I'm talking!

737
00:52:14.632 --> 00:52:18.136
All right. Now, who's Logan?
And what do you know about him?

738
00:52:18.678 --> 00:52:22.640
All I can tell you, sir,
is that he's gay, gay, gay!

739
00:52:22.849 --> 00:52:24.434
That's it.
I've had enough of this!

740
00:52:24.642 --> 00:52:28.521
You certainly have. Come with me.
You're gonna be hearing from my office, detective!

741
00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:31.065
He made me bite my tongue.
Come here.

742
00:52:31.733 --> 00:52:32.775
He hit me here.

743
00:52:33.192 --> 00:52:35.320
Next time use a phone book on him.

744
00:52:35.528 --> 00:52:37.238
And they took my shoelace.

745
00:52:37.447 --> 00:52:39.073
Hearing from your office.

746
00:52:39.324 --> 00:52:41.200
Look how she's all over him.

747
00:52:41.451 --> 00:52:44.495
And then he said I was ugly
and I couldn't read good.

748
00:52:48.708 --> 00:52:51.002
Malone.
Hey, man. What's up?

749
00:52:51.210 --> 00:52:53.254
Where the hell you been?
Some guy's been calling for you.

750
00:52:53.463 --> 00:52:55.590
Who was it?
Said he was your old partner.

751
00:52:55.757 --> 00:52:57.884
He said he hopes you found
what you've been looking for

752
00:52:58.051 --> 00:52:59.761
because your health benefits are about to expire.

753
00:53:00.094 --> 00:53:02.221
Whatever the hell
that's supposed to mean.

754
00:53:06.351 --> 00:53:08.061
Shit!

755
00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:35.129
Bingo! Yeah.

756
00:53:37.256 --> 00:53:40.134
What is it with you
and the heating ducts, sir?

757
00:53:41.302 --> 00:53:42.887
Brr. Cold. You don't feel that?

758
00:53:43.388 --> 00:53:44.430
Very cold.

759
00:53:44.639 --> 00:53:47.058
But I'm busy.
What is it you want?

760
00:53:47.266 --> 00:53:49.811
I just tried to pull up your records.

761
00:53:50.061 --> 00:53:51.521
I couldn't find any Malone.

762
00:53:52.105 --> 00:53:55.316
Oh, you're worrying about... Oh,
that's probably because it was spelled...

763
00:53:55.566 --> 00:53:57.527
I know when I had
put the name in the list...

764
00:53:57.735 --> 00:53:59.779
Sir, the badge number
doesn't exist.

765
00:54:01.656 --> 00:54:02.698
Carlson, let me talk to you.

766
00:54:02.865 --> 00:54:04.784
I wanna find out what's going on.
No, you're gonna find out.

767
00:54:04.951 --> 00:54:07.078
Let me just talk to you
for a second.

768
00:54:09.414 --> 00:54:10.832
Now, look.

769
00:54:11.833 --> 00:54:13.835
What I'm about to tell you
is classified.

770
00:54:14.043 --> 00:54:18.005
You tell anyone, I will bust
your ass down to parade detail.

771
00:54:18.172 --> 00:54:19.674
I've been on that detail.
Been on that?

772
00:54:19.841 --> 00:54:23.928
That's permanent horseshit patrol.
Okay. Yes, sir.

773
00:54:25.847 --> 00:54:29.100
This place is a cesspool. But listen.

774
00:54:29.434 --> 00:54:30.852
I'm not from West Covina.

775
00:54:31.853 --> 00:54:33.354
I'm from Internal Affairs.

776
00:54:33.646 --> 00:54:35.857
Oh, man!

777
00:54:39.986 --> 00:54:42.613
All right? This place is a cesspool.

778
00:54:43.322 --> 00:54:45.867
I can't believe I didn't notice.
It is.

779
00:54:46.117 --> 00:54:48.286
I mean,
it doesn't seem like a cesspool.

780
00:54:48.494 --> 00:54:51.706
Yeah, well, believe it, man.
There's a lot of dirty shit going on here.

781
00:54:51.956 --> 00:54:53.791
That's why they sent me here.

782
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.627
I'm the supercop here. They said,
"Go in there, investigate.

783
00:54:56.961 --> 00:54:58.880
Do what you do.
Find another supercop.

784
00:54:59.088 --> 00:55:02.049
Y'all supercop up as a team,
and crack down the shit."

785
00:55:02.383 --> 00:55:04.594
"Crack it down."
That's what I'm here to do.

786
00:55:04.802 --> 00:55:08.222
I mean, are we the only guys that know about it?
I mean, Jesus, we're in the shit now!

787
00:55:08.389 --> 00:55:10.391
Shh, shh, shh!

788
00:55:13.561 --> 00:55:15.396
You are a good cop, Carlson.

789
00:55:15.646 --> 00:55:17.440
But damn it, man,
you just dug too deep.

790
00:55:17.607 --> 00:55:20.359
Yes, sir, okay.
What do you want me to do?

791
00:55:20.568 --> 00:55:22.361
Good thing you asked.

792
00:55:22.987 --> 00:55:26.908
Keep your eyes open. Okay?
I need you to be here.

793
00:55:27.116 --> 00:55:29.410
And watch my back. Watch my back.

794
00:55:29.619 --> 00:55:32.163
Got it, sir. I'm out of here.

795
00:55:32.747 --> 00:55:34.248
The other way. Go back.

796
00:55:38.669 --> 00:55:39.879
Shit!

797
00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:01.025
Evidence room.

798
00:56:01.359 --> 00:56:03.694
Shit!
- Malone!

799
00:56:05.947 --> 00:56:08.950
There you are. I just got a call.

800
00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:10.785
There's a 413 in progress
at the airport.

801
00:56:11.035 --> 00:56:12.245
Well, y'all go ahead.
I'll catch up.

802
00:56:12.453 --> 00:56:16.457
Bullshit, you'll catch up!
Someone just stole a museum exhibit from a cargo hold.

803
00:56:16.707 --> 00:56:17.917
That's my problem?

804
00:56:18.292 --> 00:56:19.710
You're lead detective.

805
00:56:19.877 --> 00:56:22.296
I want you to get
your ass out there now!

806
00:56:22.463 --> 00:56:26.217
The FBI and Customs Service
is already on the case.

807
00:56:46.112 --> 00:56:48.489
Why are you standing out here?
They won't let me in.

808
00:56:48.739 --> 00:56:50.157
Feds are all over it.

809
00:56:50.324 --> 00:56:51.951
That's bullshit!

810
00:56:53.327 --> 00:56:56.497
These boxes contained
an entire Egyptian temple.

811
00:56:56.706 --> 00:56:59.292
Excuse me, here.
Let me see this. Man!

812
00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:00.626
And who are you?

813
00:57:00.835 --> 00:57:03.462
Malone. LAPD.

814
00:57:03.671 --> 00:57:05.423
Agent Gray. FBI.

815
00:57:06.465 --> 00:57:09.176
We'll let you boys in
after we're done.

816
00:57:11.971 --> 00:57:13.472
Look at all this stuff.

817
00:57:13.681 --> 00:57:17.935
Look at this. I mean, they nearly destroyed all this stuff,
and they didn't take none of it.

818
00:57:18.185 --> 00:57:20.313
Look, Officer Malone.

819
00:57:20.521 --> 00:57:21.772
Detective.

820
00:57:21.981 --> 00:57:24.191
You know,
I really don't have time to stand here and hold your hand.

821
00:57:24.358 --> 00:57:26.277
You're out of your jurisdiction,
and you're over your head.

822
00:57:26.485 --> 00:57:29.739
I'm over my head?
No, I'm over your head,

823
00:57:29.947 --> 00:57:31.866
because your head's up your ass.

824
00:57:33.743 --> 00:57:37.872
You're interfering with
a federal investigation, officer.

825
00:57:38.331 --> 00:57:41.125
Now, if you and your bunch
wanna feel important,

826
00:57:41.334 --> 00:57:43.669
you can help secure
the outer perimeter.

827
00:57:44.462 --> 00:57:45.630
Are we clear?

828
00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:50.635
Yeah. We clear.

829
00:57:51.135 --> 00:57:52.803
And please,

830
00:57:53.012 --> 00:57:56.766
tell your men not to touch
anything on their way out.

831
00:57:56.974 --> 00:57:59.810
It's like that?
Yeah, it's like that.

832
00:58:09.987 --> 00:58:11.906
"Head up your ass."
That was great.

833
00:58:12.156 --> 00:58:14.408
I couldn't believe you said that.

834
00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:16.577
He called me "officer."

835
00:58:16.827 --> 00:58:21.749
I'm lead detective.
I have 16 citations.

836
00:58:21.916 --> 00:58:23.417
You think that shit
comes easy?

837
00:58:23.584 --> 00:58:26.253
Come on. The guy's nothing
but an FBI asshole.

838
00:58:26.420 --> 00:58:29.423
He thinks we're good for nothing but sucking down doughnuts.
Screw him.

839
00:58:29.674 --> 00:58:31.592
Let them chase their own
goddamn temple.

840
00:58:31.842 --> 00:58:34.762
They weren't looking for no temple.
They were looking for drugs, man.

841
00:58:34.929 --> 00:58:37.014
Drugs?
Yes, drugs.

842
00:58:37.223 --> 00:58:39.100
It's the oldest trick in the book.

843
00:58:39.308 --> 00:58:40.393
You smuggle it in,

844
00:58:40.601 --> 00:58:44.939
boost it before it hits customs, huh?
Right? Make it look like a heist.

845
00:58:45.189 --> 00:58:47.066
That's how all the big boys do it.

846
00:58:47.316 --> 00:58:50.236
All they have to do is look for a truck with the letter B on it.

847
00:58:50.695 --> 00:58:51.946
What do you mean, B?

848
00:58:52.196 --> 00:58:53.614
"Bonded."

849
00:58:54.031 --> 00:58:57.952
Bonded trucks can get
into bonded warehouses.

850
00:58:58.452 --> 00:58:59.495
Let me ask you something:

851
00:59:00.037 --> 00:59:01.747
How do you know
all this stuff?

852
00:59:03.624 --> 00:59:06.961
Did a little work
in bonded warehouses.

853
00:59:07.461 --> 00:59:09.714
All right, then.
So, what are we waiting for?

854
00:59:10.131 --> 00:59:13.592
Let's do something, all right?
Come on. Call in air support.

855
00:59:14.844 --> 00:59:17.638
Dispatch, this is 37-King-5,

856
00:59:17.888 --> 00:59:21.434
put me through
to South Bay air support.

857
00:59:27.231 --> 00:59:29.650
10-12. I've got a white panel truck

858
00:59:29.859 --> 00:59:34.155
B-961, southbound on Wheeler
near Manhattan Beach intersection.

859
00:59:34.405 --> 00:59:36.115
Roger. That's it. We're close.

860
00:59:39.785 --> 00:59:42.163
Shit!
Whoa!

861
00:59:45.750 --> 00:59:47.126
Now you're in a hurry?

862
00:59:48.002 --> 00:59:50.838
Sometimes you gotta feed
a little speed to your ride.

863
00:59:51.005 --> 00:59:52.339
You know what I'm saying?

864
01:00:04.185 --> 01:00:05.311
Here we go.

865
01:00:09.315 --> 01:00:10.691
Check out the driver.

866
01:00:10.858 --> 01:00:15.404
Yeah. Five-feet-six, greasy hair, messy,
very dishevelled and...

867
01:00:15.613 --> 01:00:18.365
Are you a hairdresser
or a detective, man?

868
01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:21.035
That's a jailhouse tat.

869
01:00:21.494 --> 01:00:23.329
Driver did a stretch somewhere.

870
01:00:23.537 --> 01:00:25.289
Ten-twelve. Requesting backup.

871
01:00:25.498 --> 01:00:27.875
<i>LAPD, this is Agent Gray. FBI.</i>

872
01:00:28.042 --> 01:00:31.337
<i>Stand down.</i>

873
01:00:31.629 --> 01:00:33.130
This is bullshit!

874
01:00:33.339 --> 01:00:36.008
Screw them. Come on! Let's do it!

875
01:00:36.842 --> 01:00:38.385
Come on, you!

876
01:00:40.304 --> 01:00:41.514
Come on, get the door.

877
01:00:41.722 --> 01:00:42.723
Come on!

878
01:00:44.391 --> 01:00:47.061
Drop your weapons!
Put it down.

879
01:00:47.228 --> 01:00:50.439
All right, don't move! Stand still!

880
01:00:50.648 --> 01:00:51.690
Put it down!

881
01:00:52.233 --> 01:00:54.735
Malone! Take him! He's yours!

882
01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:58.739
Don't you run from me! Don't you run!

883
01:00:59.031 --> 01:01:01.200
All right, let's see
those hands, butterball.

884
01:01:03.369 --> 01:01:05.996
Come here!
You wanna make me run?

885
01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:12.503
Come back here!

886
01:01:32.565 --> 01:01:33.607
Come back here!

887
01:01:37.444 --> 01:01:38.612
Bring your ass here!

888
01:01:39.196 --> 01:01:40.239
Come here!

889
01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:47.371
Come here!

890
01:01:48.789 --> 01:01:50.249
It's okay. Don't worry. I'm a cop.

891
01:01:52.126 --> 01:01:53.377
All right?

892
01:01:54.628 --> 01:01:55.671
Damn!

893
01:02:00.467 --> 01:02:02.720
Don't you know better
than to run from the police?

894
01:02:02.928 --> 01:02:04.805
I do.
You got me tired, you know that.

895
01:02:04.972 --> 01:02:06.557
I don't like to get tired.

896
01:02:06.724 --> 01:02:09.143
When I get tired,
that means I got a ass to whup.

897
01:02:09.310 --> 01:02:12.313
And I think that's what I'm about to do.
Get your ass up!

898
01:02:17.318 --> 01:02:18.569
Bingo.

899
01:02:18.819 --> 01:02:20.487
That's the shit.

900
01:02:25.117 --> 01:02:29.330
We showed them,
and that's what I wanted to do, you know?

901
01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:31.415
Put this into evidence.
Exactly.

902
01:02:31.624 --> 01:02:33.334
Evidence, exactly.
I'm gonna go up with it.

903
01:02:33.584 --> 01:02:35.794
No, no, no.
I want you interrogating those men right now.

904
01:02:36.003 --> 01:02:38.505
Oh, no. See, I need to
go up with this stuff

905
01:02:38.672 --> 01:02:40.925
and book it
into evidence personally.

906
01:02:41.133 --> 01:02:42.176
Why?

907
01:02:43.844 --> 01:02:45.846
I gotta go through it
for clues and shit.

908
01:02:46.013 --> 01:02:50.267
First you gotta interrogate the suspects.
Find out where they were going.

909
01:02:50.809 --> 01:02:55.105
Then, when you get them to talk,
you can go through all the evidence you want.

910
01:02:55.314 --> 01:02:57.191
But, sir...

911
01:02:58.108 --> 01:03:02.780
If I get the clue,
I think it'd make for a better ass-whupping in the interrogation room.

912
01:03:02.988 --> 01:03:04.865
Let's hear it for Detective Malone!

913
01:03:17.378 --> 01:03:20.172
That's it! I want a lawyer.
You cops can't do this.

914
01:03:20.381 --> 01:03:22.007
I got news for you.
I ain't a cop.

915
01:03:24.551 --> 01:03:26.011
God, he's good.

916
01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:28.597
I checked him out.
West Covina never heard of him.

917
01:03:29.598 --> 01:03:31.684
So you know.
Know what?

918
01:03:31.892 --> 01:03:33.310
He's Internal Affairs.

919
01:03:33.519 --> 01:03:35.646
What the hell you talking about?
He's not I.A.

920
01:03:35.854 --> 01:03:38.148
He's not?
Hell, no. He's FBI.

921
01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:41.694
But he hates the FBI.

922
01:03:41.902 --> 01:03:44.905
Yeah, right. That's just to throw you off.
What, do you think this whole thing is an accident?

923
01:03:45.155 --> 01:03:48.742
He knew about the heroin thing from the start.
FBI probably planted him here.

924
01:03:48.993 --> 01:03:52.621
Thinking he'd get first jump on the burglary call.
Afraid we'd screw it up.

925
01:03:52.913 --> 01:03:54.665
Pencil-dicks.
Wow.

926
01:03:58.252 --> 01:04:00.754
You don't get that kind of training
at the academy.

927
01:04:01.005 --> 01:04:02.756
No, that's old school, man.

928
01:04:02.923 --> 01:04:04.717
You're crushing my head!

929
01:04:07.219 --> 01:04:09.054
That's federal government training.

930
01:04:09.263 --> 01:04:11.849
Yeah. Like Navy SEAL stuff.

931
01:04:14.393 --> 01:04:16.145
Come on. Let's go give him a hand.

932
01:04:18.605 --> 01:04:21.859
All right! All right!
I'll talk! Oh, man!

933
01:04:55.684 --> 01:04:57.561
Look at you.

934
01:04:57.770 --> 01:05:00.189
It was all worth it for you, baby.

935
01:05:00.355 --> 01:05:03.400
Malone!
Oh! Oh, uh...

936
01:05:04.985 --> 01:05:06.445
Malone!

937
01:05:07.738 --> 01:05:09.114
What the hell
are you doing up there?

938
01:05:10.324 --> 01:05:15.120
I'm just so happy that we're keeping
these drugs off the street.

939
01:05:15.329 --> 01:05:17.998
Well, get over it. They're going
right back out again.

940
01:05:18.207 --> 01:05:21.126
Why?
Because the FBI wants to take it

941
01:05:21.293 --> 01:05:22.586
to their lab right away.

942
01:05:22.795 --> 01:05:23.921
Roll it out.

943
01:05:28.509 --> 01:05:29.551
Malone, come on!

944
01:05:29.843 --> 01:05:31.303
Let's go.

945
01:05:32.805 --> 01:05:34.014
Come on, Malone.

946
01:05:47.236 --> 01:05:48.445
Detective.
Malone.

947
01:05:49.613 --> 01:05:52.324
That heroin belongs
to Jean LaFleur.

948
01:05:52.699 --> 01:05:54.326
We've been after him
for 5 years,

949
01:05:54.535 --> 01:05:57.496
but he keeps shifting his operations between the U.S. and Mexico.

950
01:05:57.830 --> 01:05:59.498
We're taking it down
to our lab right now.

951
01:05:59.665 --> 01:06:01.875
Um, I don't think
that's such a good idea.

952
01:06:02.126 --> 01:06:03.168
Why not?

953
01:06:03.544 --> 01:06:06.380
Uh, why don't we
just keep it here with us?

954
01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:10.050
LaFleur doesn't know we have it.
We could use it for bait.

955
01:06:11.385 --> 01:06:12.553
You mean a sting?

956
01:06:12.886 --> 01:06:15.514
Exactly. A sting!

957
01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:20.227
Now, LaFleur expects these drugs
to be in San Diego in three hours.

958
01:06:20.477 --> 01:06:23.814
What kind of sting operation can you
get off the ground before then?

959
01:06:24.481 --> 01:06:27.276
The driver told me one of the guys
on the truck was new.

960
01:06:27.484 --> 01:06:29.570
You can replace him
with somebody else.

961
01:06:29.778 --> 01:06:33.740
Then catch LaFleur when he goes
to pick up the drugs. Bam, got him!

962
01:06:33.907 --> 01:06:35.284
Let me get this straight.

963
01:06:35.492 --> 01:06:39.371
You're volunteering to escort
these drugs right into the hands

964
01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:42.583
of the most dangerous drug dealer
in the northern hemisphere?

965
01:06:42.916 --> 01:06:43.917
Hell, no!

966
01:06:44.168 --> 01:06:45.836
What do you need
to make it work, Malone?

967
01:06:47.379 --> 01:06:48.463
Me?
- Absolutely!

968
01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:49.798
You're the man for the job!

969
01:06:50.007 --> 01:06:52.885
FBI's gonna have tactical command,
but we're gonna follow your lead.

970
01:06:53.093 --> 01:06:56.054
It's very brave of you, detective.
Let's get going. We don't have much time.

971
01:06:56.263 --> 01:06:58.056
Way to go, Malone. Way to go.

972
01:06:58.307 --> 01:07:00.100
I'm just suggesting some shit
that y'all can do.

973
01:07:00.267 --> 01:07:01.852
We need more men like you
in this department.

974
01:07:04.938 --> 01:07:07.941
All right. Hurry up.
Go. Get out of here!

975
01:07:08.233 --> 01:07:10.027
Wait. Hold up. Wait a minute.

976
01:07:10.235 --> 01:07:13.322
You wanted to go.
I'm getting you out of here. Go!

977
01:07:13.572 --> 01:07:16.408
You wouldn't still be here
unless that diamond was here.

978
01:07:16.617 --> 01:07:17.618
I want my cut!

979
01:07:17.868 --> 01:07:21.205
There ain't nothing to cut. I'm trying to,
but I gotta get the diamond first.

980
01:07:21.455 --> 01:07:22.623
Well, go get it. I'll wait.

981
01:07:22.873 --> 01:07:25.876
I'm trying to. First, I gotta
run a sting on a drug dealer.

982
01:07:26.251 --> 01:07:27.628
You're a goddamn liar!

983
01:07:27.836 --> 01:07:30.631
Would I make this shit up?
Now, go, Tulley! Get out of here!

984
01:07:30.839 --> 01:07:33.967
I'll see you at Lou's tomorrow.
I wanna talk about this!

985
01:07:34.134 --> 01:07:36.136
Wait a minute.
I don't know what you're doing,

986
01:07:36.386 --> 01:07:37.846
but it ain't gonna work!
Hey!

987
01:07:38.096 --> 01:07:39.932
And let me get my gun back!

988
01:07:46.396 --> 01:07:50.150
Look. Maybe this isn't
a good idea, you know?

989
01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:53.362
This is a great idea. It'll work.
Brilliant.

990
01:07:53.570 --> 01:07:56.949
LaFleur's gonna be looking for this.
We know what we're doing, detective.

991
01:07:57.157 --> 01:07:58.575
Oh, I'm a detective now.

992
01:07:58.742 --> 01:08:00.577
Detective, can you
give us a level, please.

993
01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:03.580
All right, detective.

994
01:08:03.789 --> 01:08:08.001
Now, the objective here is to have these individuals
look upon you as if you were one of them:

995
01:08:08.377 --> 01:08:12.089
A member of the criminal underworld.
So it's important that your actions, your speech,

996
01:08:12.339 --> 01:08:17.177
and your general mode of behaviour is all congruent
with their expectation of a fellow criminal.

997
01:08:17.386 --> 01:08:20.013
Oh, okay, I get it.
Sort of "walk the walk."

998
01:08:20.264 --> 01:08:21.306
That's right.

999
01:08:21.682 --> 01:08:24.268
You have to look, act,

1000
01:08:24.476 --> 01:08:26.770
and even think like a criminal.

1001
01:08:26.979 --> 01:08:28.772
And you're gonna have to
change your speech patterns too.

1002
01:08:29.022 --> 01:08:33.193
Most criminals like to use slang
terminology, profanity and so forth,

1003
01:08:33.402 --> 01:08:36.697
especially with regard to police
and authority figures.

1004
01:08:36.989 --> 01:08:39.700
You mean like, "Shut the hell up,
you dickless FBI..."

1005
01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:41.702
That's right. That'll do.
"You stupid ass."

1006
01:08:41.952 --> 01:08:43.328
I said, that'll do.
"You tight..."

1007
01:08:43.537 --> 01:08:44.705
Enough!

1008
01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:47.624
All right, listen up.

1009
01:08:47.833 --> 01:08:49.543
LaFleur's a killer.

1010
01:08:49.793 --> 01:08:54.548
If he senses anything amiss, Malone
is gonna be in one hell of a tight spot.

1011
01:08:54.715 --> 01:08:57.968
Now, we're gonna act in concert
with the FBI...

1012
01:08:58.135 --> 01:08:59.928
Carlson.

1013
01:09:00.095 --> 01:09:03.348
If anything happens to me,
forget everything I ever told you.

1014
01:09:03.557 --> 01:09:05.642
You mean about Internal Affairs?

1015
01:09:05.851 --> 01:09:07.644
No, Carlson. I mean about everything.

1016
01:09:07.978 --> 01:09:09.938
Detective, saddle up.
Okay?

1017
01:09:10.147 --> 01:09:11.732
Okay. Good luck.

1018
01:09:16.194 --> 01:09:19.072
Carlson, remember. Forget it!

1019
01:09:19.239 --> 01:09:20.407
Time to go.

1020
01:09:22.993 --> 01:09:24.036
Detective.

1021
01:09:24.536 --> 01:09:28.332
If my client gets so much as a scratch on him while he's in your custody,

1022
01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:33.545
I won't stop until your badge is revoked and you're thrown in jail.
Okay? You got me?

1023
01:09:33.754 --> 01:09:35.255
You can't touch me.

1024
01:09:36.423 --> 01:09:38.258
Ow!
Detective!

1025
01:09:38.425 --> 01:09:42.095
He'll be fine, counsellor. Malone,
let's get this show on the road.

1026
01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:44.848
Drive. Buckle up.

1027
01:09:47.893 --> 01:09:50.395
All right. Give me video.
- <i>Let's get one thing straight.</i>

1028
01:09:50.604 --> 01:09:53.273
This is my side over here
and that's your side over there.

1029
01:09:53.523 --> 01:09:55.734
You stay on your side
and I'm gonna stay on mine.

1030
01:09:56.443 --> 01:09:59.112
Gentlemen. Let's keep
the chatter to a minimum.

1031
01:09:59.363 --> 01:10:02.407
Hey, you don't like the show,
change the channel.

1032
01:10:02.783 --> 01:10:04.951
And keep this channel clear.

1033
01:10:08.705 --> 01:10:10.540
Who is this guy?

1034
01:10:10.999 --> 01:10:12.084
That's Malone.

1035
01:10:13.794 --> 01:10:15.253
I can't drive if
you're gonna do that.

1036
01:10:15.796 --> 01:10:17.214
Drive!

1037
01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:38.318
All right,
we're coming up on our exit.

1038
01:10:40.237 --> 01:10:43.490
All units, this is Gray.
Fall back and keep your distance.

1039
01:10:53.792 --> 01:10:55.252
We're approaching the site now.

1040
01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:57.796
LAPD, take the south side.
We'll take the north.

1041
01:11:22.779 --> 01:11:25.323
They're headed into Warehouse 3.

1042
01:11:25.574 --> 01:11:27.701
Focus in. Closer.

1043
01:11:35.709 --> 01:11:36.751
This is it.

1044
01:11:36.918 --> 01:11:38.795
You sure?
Yeah. Warehouse 3.

1045
01:11:39.129 --> 01:11:43.383
All right, Benny, sit tight
and keep your mouth shut.

1046
01:11:43.633 --> 01:11:44.843
Yeah. Thanks for the tip.

1047
01:11:51.475 --> 01:11:52.684
What the hell's Malone doing?

1048
01:12:00.484 --> 01:12:02.402
They're coming in.
They're right behind you.

1049
01:12:02.611 --> 01:12:04.529
Get ready. Here he comes.

1050
01:12:09.576 --> 01:12:11.828
Ooh! That's what I'm talking about!

1051
01:12:12.621 --> 01:12:14.706
That's the shit.
Yeah, you're right! That's the shit.

1052
01:12:14.915 --> 01:12:17.125
All 500 kilos!

1053
01:12:17.918 --> 01:12:21.129
What are you talking about, man? Come on,
let's get out of here! I want my cut!

1054
01:12:21.338 --> 01:12:23.423
- You still got it?
- We still have a signal.

1055
01:12:23.673 --> 01:12:24.758
It's just all distorted.

1056
01:12:25.926 --> 01:12:27.135
Can you hear him?

1057
01:12:27.344 --> 01:12:30.514
We can't get out of here, okay?
They got cops everywhere.

1058
01:12:30.722 --> 01:12:34.059
So? You're one of them.
No, no, no.

1059
01:12:34.226 --> 01:12:35.435
I'm a drug dealer now.

1060
01:12:35.936 --> 01:12:38.104
Man, listen to me.
You're a jewel thief.

1061
01:12:38.271 --> 01:12:41.608
Shh! I'm a drug dealer now!

1062
01:12:41.775 --> 01:12:44.444
Man, why are you selling this shit when
you got that big diamond in your hand?

1063
01:12:45.195 --> 01:12:46.363
Just like old times.

1064
01:12:47.239 --> 01:12:49.074
I don't believe that shit!

1065
01:12:51.117 --> 01:12:52.285
What is this, a reunion?

1066
01:12:52.536 --> 01:12:55.539
Look what we got here, huh.
Give it up.

1067
01:12:56.414 --> 01:12:58.250
Isn't that beautiful? Say bye.

1068
01:12:59.042 --> 01:13:00.085
Welcome to the party.

1069
01:13:00.377 --> 01:13:01.419
Son of a bitch!

1070
01:13:02.170 --> 01:13:03.463
We've lost him.

1071
01:13:03.672 --> 01:13:05.674
I'll enjoy doing you more
than I did Eddie.

1072
01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:07.968
Deacon, man.
Shut up!

1073
01:13:17.102 --> 01:13:18.770
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1074
01:13:18.979 --> 01:13:21.147
Know anything about this?
I don't know shit about this!

1075
01:13:21.314 --> 01:13:22.774
I'm getting ready to throw up.

1076
01:13:30.323 --> 01:13:33.660
What the hell? All units, stand by.

1077
01:13:38.915 --> 01:13:41.001
Miles, what's going on?
I don't know!

1078
01:13:41.167 --> 01:13:43.628
Tulley?
I never know what's going on!

1079
01:13:49.593 --> 01:13:51.761
Take it down! Here. Bring it in.

1080
01:14:00.854 --> 01:14:04.399
Out of the truck. Out of the truck!
Come on, get out. Get out.

1081
01:14:08.236 --> 01:14:09.696
Benny, what's going on?

1082
01:14:10.071 --> 01:14:11.489
It took longer than I thought.

1083
01:14:11.781 --> 01:14:14.868
What happened to your face?
- Nothing. Not a big deal.

1084
01:14:15.035 --> 01:14:16.453
Who are these two guys?
Who hired them?

1085
01:14:16.661 --> 01:14:18.455
I did. You told me to get guys.
I got guys.

1086
01:14:18.622 --> 01:14:21.374
Benny, you didn't introduce me.
Hey, how you doing?

1087
01:14:21.541 --> 01:14:24.377
Pete. Nice to meet you.
Heard a lot about you.

1088
01:14:26.046 --> 01:14:27.339
And who might you be?

1089
01:14:28.506 --> 01:14:31.343
Oh, you don't wanna mess with him.
That's a stone-cold killer.

1090
01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:34.512
Yeah, you don't wanna mess with him.
I mean, he's stone-cold.

1091
01:14:34.679 --> 01:14:40.060
Hoo! That boy is bad.
I seen him rip somebody's guts out through their ass

1092
01:14:40.352 --> 01:14:41.895
and their eyes fell out.

1093
01:14:42.145 --> 01:14:43.188
Do the move that you do!

1094
01:14:43.396 --> 01:14:45.065
The gut-and-eyes move.

1095
01:14:45.231 --> 01:14:47.025
All right.

1096
01:14:54.908 --> 01:14:57.327
That's where the guts went splat.
Just dropped them.

1097
01:14:57.535 --> 01:14:58.662
I'm bad.

1098
01:14:59.037 --> 01:15:02.999
No, I'm bad, baby.
I'll rip your lips off and kiss my ass with them shits.

1099
01:15:03.208 --> 01:15:04.250
I seen him do it.

1100
01:15:04.417 --> 01:15:05.919
I do that.
That's how I get down, baby.

1101
01:15:06.169 --> 01:15:09.339
I'll rip your tongue out
and lick my balls with them.

1102
01:15:09.547 --> 01:15:10.715
Shut up.

1103
01:15:11.216 --> 01:15:12.258
Check him out.

1104
01:15:13.802 --> 01:15:15.762
Francois, you search him.

1105
01:15:16.596 --> 01:15:18.390
They're on to them. We're moving in.
- No, wait.

1106
01:15:18.723 --> 01:15:21.184
This must be a part of his plan.
Malone knows what he's doing.

1107
01:15:21.393 --> 01:15:23.895
What plan?
He's unarmed and outnumbered.

1108
01:15:24.104 --> 01:15:26.815
Trust me.
You should see Malone's résumé.

1109
01:15:27.941 --> 01:15:30.360
This is like a walk in the park
for him.

1110
01:15:30.944 --> 01:15:32.737
I must tell you, Pete.

1111
01:15:33.530 --> 01:15:35.198
You look the part,

1112
01:15:35.699 --> 01:15:37.617
you certainly talk the talk...

1113
01:15:39.285 --> 01:15:41.621
but you still stink like a cop.

1114
01:15:41.788 --> 01:15:44.624
Damn! Damn it!
I knew he would catch us, man.

1115
01:15:44.833 --> 01:15:46.543
Shut up! That's bullshit.

1116
01:15:46.793 --> 01:15:50.547
Come on, man. Just talk to him.
We might get out of here!

1117
01:15:51.464 --> 01:15:52.882
See? He's lying!

1118
01:15:53.091 --> 01:15:57.262
If I was a cop, would I have busted his shit?
All that's bleeding! Trinkling, now.

1119
01:15:57.470 --> 01:15:58.638
Lock him in the car.

1120
01:15:59.139 --> 01:16:00.348
That's right.
Get him out of here.

1121
01:16:00.557 --> 01:16:01.599
If I was a cop...

1122
01:16:01.891 --> 01:16:02.976
Shut up!

1123
01:16:05.145 --> 01:16:06.813
My nose bleeding!

1124
01:16:07.105 --> 01:16:08.314
Damn!

1125
01:16:08.773 --> 01:16:10.108
You better
tell us the truth.

1126
01:16:11.568 --> 01:16:13.111
He's a cop.

1127
01:16:13.778 --> 01:16:16.114
He hijacked the truck.
This is a setup.

1128
01:16:16.322 --> 01:16:19.451
If I was a cop, FBIs would be
in here right now, man,

1129
01:16:19.659 --> 01:16:21.119
taking everybody to jail!

1130
01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:23.997
I think...

1131
01:16:24.497 --> 01:16:26.166
I have an idea.

1132
01:16:28.042 --> 01:16:29.961
Francois.

1133
01:16:30.795 --> 01:16:34.674
Did you see...? Look, he ain't...
You wanna prove you aren't a cop?

1134
01:16:35.675 --> 01:16:37.343
Yeah.

1135
01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:38.553
You say he's lying.

1136
01:16:40.138 --> 01:16:41.181
Damn right, he's lying

1137
01:16:41.347 --> 01:16:42.515
Shoot him.

1138
01:16:43.808 --> 01:16:46.519
Shoot him.
No problem.

1139
01:16:48.021 --> 01:16:49.105
Oh, shit!

1140
01:16:49.272 --> 01:16:51.816
You son of a bitch!
- I meant, kill him.

1141
01:16:53.401 --> 01:16:56.279
You didn't say that.
You just said, "Shoot him."

1142
01:16:57.530 --> 01:16:59.449
You want to prove you
are not a cop?

1143
01:17:00.825 --> 01:17:02.285
Kill him.

1144
01:17:05.705 --> 01:17:07.707
There ain't no
coming back for him.

1145
01:17:18.426 --> 01:17:21.221
That's it. We're moving in.
All units, move in.

1146
01:17:22.180 --> 01:17:23.223
Let's go!

1147
01:17:48.540 --> 01:17:49.582
Shit!

1148
01:17:53.795 --> 01:17:57.257
Deke! Give me the diamond or
I'll pop another one in your ass!

1149
01:17:57.507 --> 01:17:58.758
You had your chance, Miles.

1150
01:18:09.227 --> 01:18:10.353
Freeze! LAPD!

1151
01:18:10.562 --> 01:18:12.105
Show me your hands!

1152
01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:18.403
Nice shot.

1153
01:18:22.574 --> 01:18:24.784
Get out of the car!
Get out of the car! Turn around!

1154
01:18:34.043 --> 01:18:35.086
Shit!

1155
01:19:16.586 --> 01:19:18.463
All units, this is Agent Gray, FBI.

1156
01:19:18.671 --> 01:19:21.674
Be advised,
we have no authority to pursue the suspect beyond our border.

1157
01:19:22.050 --> 01:19:23.968
<i>Do not cross into Mexico!</i>

1158
01:19:45.156 --> 01:19:49.494
Pursuit of suspect heading southbound.
We have an undercover officer on board.

1159
01:19:49.702 --> 01:19:52.372
We have
a friendly on board. Over!

1160
01:19:52.622 --> 01:19:54.165
<i>Roger that!</i>

1161
01:20:03.216 --> 01:20:04.384
Hold on!

1162
01:20:21.401 --> 01:20:22.652
Shit!

1163
01:21:17.165 --> 01:21:18.583
Look out!

1164
01:21:31.179 --> 01:21:33.264
Get him! I'm glad to see y'all!

1165
01:21:33.890 --> 01:21:35.475
What are you waiting for? Go!

1166
01:21:35.725 --> 01:21:38.144
We can't, Malone.
We have no jurisdiction.

1167
01:21:38.311 --> 01:21:40.813
Damn that! Damn the jurisdiction!
Go! Now!

1168
01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:43.316
We cannot cross into Mexico.

1169
01:21:43.691 --> 01:21:45.735
You can't? You can't?
No. No!

1170
01:21:45.902 --> 01:21:48.529
Watch me.
Malone. Malone.

1171
01:21:48.696 --> 01:21:49.739
Believe that!

1172
01:21:49.906 --> 01:21:52.575
Malone!
Move your ass!

1173
01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:19.143
Damn it! One bullet.

1174
01:22:30.488 --> 01:22:31.531
Come on, Miles!

1175
01:22:37.745 --> 01:22:38.788
Shit!

1176
01:23:14.073 --> 01:23:16.909
You're under arrest.
What the hell you think you're doing?

1177
01:23:17.076 --> 01:23:18.619
I'm arresting you before they get here.

1178
01:23:18.786 --> 01:23:20.037
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

1179
01:23:20.204 --> 01:23:21.914
I'll just blow your head off
before they get here. Huh?

1180
01:23:22.081 --> 01:23:26.169
No, no. See, the way I see it
is you got 30 seconds

1181
01:23:26.377 --> 01:23:28.754
before they make
a piñata out of your ass.

1182
01:23:28.921 --> 01:23:30.214
What the hell
are they talking about?

1183
01:23:31.382 --> 01:23:33.718
Malone is an expert negotiator.

1184
01:23:33.926 --> 01:23:35.094
He's an expert, sir.

1185
01:23:35.469 --> 01:23:37.930
Now. You got two choices.

1186
01:23:38.264 --> 01:23:40.391
You can wind up somebody's bitch

1187
01:23:40.766 --> 01:23:42.310
or you can wind up
somebody's señorita.

1188
01:23:42.518 --> 01:23:44.312
Make up your mind.
Your choice.

1189
01:23:44.604 --> 01:23:47.565
I got three choices, okay?
Maybe I just tell them who you are.

1190
01:23:47.773 --> 01:23:51.694
No. You gonna shut your mouth.
Because maybe I'll cut you back in on the diamond.

1191
01:23:52.111 --> 01:23:55.948
Shithead, I got the goddamn diamond.

1192
01:23:56.199 --> 01:23:58.242
Let me get that.
I'm your only way out, Deke!

1193
01:23:58.743 --> 01:24:00.453
Now, give me the gun.

1194
01:24:00.661 --> 01:24:02.371
I know you don't wanna go
to jail in Mexico.

1195
01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:06.667
Nobody wanna go to jail in Mexico.
Where they put all kind of burritos in your ass.

1196
01:24:06.834 --> 01:24:07.960
Shut up!

1197
01:24:08.127 --> 01:24:11.088
Come on, Deke. Give me
the gun. Come on!

1198
01:24:11.297 --> 01:24:15.259
They think I'm a cop!
They think I'm a cop, man!

1199
01:24:15.468 --> 01:24:17.470
I can help you, okay?

1200
01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:20.640
You don't wanna die here.
Okay? Now give that up.

1201
01:24:20.848 --> 01:24:23.851
If you screw me, I swear to God,
I'll come back for you.

1202
01:24:24.060 --> 01:24:25.728
I swear to God
I'll come back for you!

1203
01:24:25.978 --> 01:24:27.104
Give me the gun!

1204
01:24:29.649 --> 01:24:32.109
There you go.
Let me get that up out you.

1205
01:24:32.485 --> 01:24:34.445
Come on. Let it go.
There you go.

1206
01:24:38.783 --> 01:24:40.618
There you go.

1207
01:24:42.453 --> 01:24:43.746
Now, Deke...

1208
01:24:46.499 --> 01:24:48.000
this is gonna hurt
a little bit.

1209
01:24:50.670 --> 01:24:51.796
Holy Christ!

1210
01:24:55.758 --> 01:24:56.801
That's for Eddie.

1211
01:25:02.515 --> 01:25:04.016
You son of a bitch!
Miles!

1212
01:25:04.183 --> 01:25:05.685
Come back here!

1213
01:25:05.977 --> 01:25:07.103
You son of a bitch!

1214
01:25:07.979 --> 01:25:09.313
Miles, you die!

1215
01:25:44.056 --> 01:25:45.349
You all right?

1216
01:25:45.516 --> 01:25:48.561
Yeah. I needed
a vacation anyway, right?

1217
01:25:50.313 --> 01:25:53.024
The FBI needs to talk to you,
Detective Malone.

1218
01:25:57.403 --> 01:26:01.073
Peterson, regional director, FBI.
We need to talk.

1219
01:26:01.324 --> 01:26:03.451
Wait a minute.
Slow down.

1220
01:26:03.659 --> 01:26:05.536
No, lieutenant,
I will not slow down.

1221
01:26:05.828 --> 01:26:07.955
Is this man one of yours

1222
01:26:08.748 --> 01:26:10.082
or not?

1223
01:26:11.959 --> 01:26:13.502
You bet your ass he is.

1224
01:26:14.378 --> 01:26:17.214
Well, I'm gonna find out
what happened here,

1225
01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:22.720
even if it means putting your entire
department under federal review.

1226
01:26:23.763 --> 01:26:26.849
Malone. Nice work.

1227
01:26:29.977 --> 01:26:32.146
Okay, Malone.

1228
01:26:32.313 --> 01:26:34.982
My office just spent the last hour talking to West Covina

1229
01:26:35.149 --> 01:26:36.859
and to the U.S. Attorney's Office,

1230
01:26:37.068 --> 01:26:39.779
trying to find out just who the hell it is you're working for.

1231
01:26:40.029 --> 01:26:42.448
Now we know it's not the Bureau.

1232
01:26:42.615 --> 01:26:44.784
I think it's time that you
gave us an explanation.

1233
01:26:49.997 --> 01:26:51.499
I'm a <i>federale.</i>

1234
01:26:51.665 --> 01:26:53.709
A <i>federale?</i>
Whoa.

1235
01:26:53.918 --> 01:26:56.462
Look across that border.
What do you see?

1236
01:26:56.712 --> 01:27:00.007
That is the Democratic
Republic of Mexico.

1237
01:27:00.216 --> 01:27:01.634
You're Mexican?
That's right.

1238
01:27:01.801 --> 01:27:03.094
On my mother's father's side.

1239
01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:05.054
Yeah, I guess I can see it.

1240
01:27:05.221 --> 01:27:06.514
<i>Glacias,</i> thank you.

1241
01:27:06.722 --> 01:27:09.141
Gentlemen, I shouldn't be
telling y'all this,

1242
01:27:09.308 --> 01:27:10.893
because I could
lose my <i>federale-</i>hood.

1243
01:27:11.102 --> 01:27:13.562
Your what?
My <i>federale-</i>hood!

1244
01:27:14.814 --> 01:27:16.982
Look, I had to throw
you guys off, okay?

1245
01:27:17.274 --> 01:27:19.110
I was doing it for my country.

1246
01:27:19.318 --> 01:27:20.653
The red,

1247
01:27:21.153 --> 01:27:22.530
the white,

1248
01:27:23.322 --> 01:27:24.407
and the green.

1249
01:27:25.908 --> 01:27:29.036
Now, if you guys will excuse me,
I'm gonna have to get across this border

1250
01:27:29.245 --> 01:27:32.331
and school some of my <i>compadres,</i>
you know, on what...

1251
01:27:32.581 --> 01:27:36.252
Just on some things that we like to talk about.
So y'all stay up. Be cool.

1252
01:27:44.552 --> 01:27:48.264
What's happening?
Hook a brother up with a taco!

1253
01:27:48.472 --> 01:27:50.057
A burrito!

1254
01:27:53.853 --> 01:27:58.190
I can't believe so much bad shit
can happen on such a beautiful day.

1255
01:27:58.357 --> 01:28:02.153
Malone! Malone.

1256
01:28:02.820 --> 01:28:04.363
Yeah, what?

1257
01:28:04.738 --> 01:28:06.574
I think your Spanish
is a little rusty.

1258
01:28:06.782 --> 01:28:10.202
You just told those men
you got a big cat in your pants.

1259
01:28:12.580 --> 01:28:17.376
Well, you know, that's a Latin thing. Macho.
Yeah, yeah. You wouldn't understand.

1260
01:28:18.127 --> 01:28:20.588
No, I think I do understand...

1261
01:28:23.549 --> 01:28:24.550
Logan.

1262
01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:25.843
What?

1263
01:28:28.846 --> 01:28:30.222
How'd you know it was me?

1264
01:28:30.389 --> 01:28:32.349
I started thinking,
if I was Miles Logan

1265
01:28:32.558 --> 01:28:36.896
and had my diamond hidden in a police building,
what would I do?

1266
01:28:37.313 --> 01:28:38.898
So I thought like a crook.

1267
01:28:39.231 --> 01:28:40.733
Is that right?

1268
01:28:41.525 --> 01:28:42.693
I don't believe this.

1269
01:28:42.902 --> 01:28:44.862
He's a major felon.

1270
01:28:45.196 --> 01:28:47.239
This is one hell of a bust, Carlson.

1271
01:28:47.406 --> 01:28:51.118
Yeah. It's a hell
of a bust for us.

1272
01:28:53.204 --> 01:28:54.914
It's just too bad
we can't make it.

1273
01:28:55.664 --> 01:28:56.916
Say what?

1274
01:28:57.249 --> 01:28:59.543
You heard the FBI.
They're extremely strict

1275
01:28:59.752 --> 01:29:03.547
about pursuing suspects
across international borders.

1276
01:29:04.423 --> 01:29:06.759
And you're just
out of our jurisdiction.

1277
01:29:11.388 --> 01:29:12.515
You're...?

1278
01:29:13.432 --> 01:29:15.100
Yeah, exactly,
because I'm across the...

1279
01:29:15.267 --> 01:29:18.771
If I'm across the border and you're
over there, there's no way you...

1280
01:29:21.607 --> 01:29:24.860
Yeah!
I love this jurisdiction shit!

1281
01:29:27.696 --> 01:29:30.574
I guess this is the last time
I'm gonna see you boys.

1282
01:29:30.741 --> 01:29:34.411
Yeah. But, you know,
maybe we'll catch you later.

1283
01:29:34.787 --> 01:29:35.788
Is it like that?

1284
01:29:35.955 --> 01:29:37.456
Yeah. It's like that.

1285
01:29:46.757 --> 01:29:48.384
Ooh.
Oh, oh.

1286
01:29:48.551 --> 01:29:50.761
Right there. Jurisdiction.

1287
01:29:54.306 --> 01:29:56.600
Thanks.
Know what I mean?

1288
01:29:58.561 --> 01:30:01.981
<i>Viva Las Mexico,</i>
and I'm out!
