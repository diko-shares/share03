418

went missing
at the harvest festival.

I know she's alive,

435
00:37:37.925 --> 00:37:40.661
but I also know
that she's desperately afraid.

436
00:37:41.629 --> 00:37:44.498
And more than anything,
she wants us to bring her home.

437
00:37:47.568 --> 00:37:49.070
I need your prayers.

438
00:37:49.704 --> 00:37:53.908

Now, please, pray with me.

Every year, we drive him out,
and yet he's still here.

Henry: Yeah.

868
01:09:03.678 --> 01:09:06.014
It was supposed to be
a nice thing to do

869
01:09:06.146 --> 01:09:07.314
on a Wednesday afternoon

870
01:09:07.447 --> 01:09:08.482
when you were giving
the Eucharist.

871
01:09:08.616 --> 01:09:09.817
Well, the police came,

872
01:09:09.984 --> 01:09:11.451
and they tried
to take all evidence of it.

873
01:09:11.586 --> 01:09:13.121
All of her drawings
about the festival,

874
01:09:13.253 --> 01:09:14.656

- No, no, no, no.

880
01:09:25.967 --> 01:09:27.602
Maybe, this is just
a bunch of people

881

some meaning in their lives.

882

No, no, no. It's more than that.
It's...

to believe in,

884

how wonderful that can be,

885

for our daughter?
