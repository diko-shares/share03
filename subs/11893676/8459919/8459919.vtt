1
00:03:00.048 --> 00:03:02.182
Thank you, Ida.

2
00:03:02.517 --> 00:03:05.352
Sorry!

3
00:03:09.857 --> 00:03:12.259
When we bring a child
into this world...

4
00:03:12.492 --> 00:03:13.828
...we're making a commitment

5
00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:16.831
to offer them
the best possible start in life.

6
00:03:17.031 --> 00:03:19.266
<i>We nurture them,</i>

7
00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:22.235
<i>teach them and protect them.</i>

8
00:03:23.805 --> 00:03:26.406
<i>We vow to guide them</i>
<i>through the darkness</i>

9
00:03:26.541 --> 00:03:28.643
<i>and lead them towards</i>
<i>the light.</i>

10
00:03:32.013 --> 00:03:34.281
We know that baptism
doesn't magically transform

11
00:03:34.414 --> 00:03:35.683
sinner to saint,

12
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.787
but it does publicly declare
our devotion to Christ.

13
00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:46.160
<i>And today, we welcome</i>
<i>Emma into our family,</i>

14
00:03:46.594 --> 00:03:48.730
by giving her the greatest gift
we can offer,

15
00:03:49.362 --> 00:03:51.364
<i>God's unconditional love.</i>

16
00:03:55.103 --> 00:03:56.369
<i>On her behalf,</i>

17
00:03:56.804 --> 00:03:58.506
will you confirm
that you have turned

18
00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:01.408
against all that is evil
and sinful...

19
00:04:02.543 --> 00:04:05.345
<i>and instead turn towards</i>
<i>Christ?</i>

20
00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:10.350
Bunbun.

21
00:04:11.052 --> 00:04:13.487
<i>Christ confirms you</i>
<i>as his own.</i>

22
00:04:15.388 --> 00:04:19.794
Do not be ashamed to confess
the faith in Christ crucified.

23
00:04:23.064 --> 00:04:25.666
Receive the sign of the cross.

24
00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:30.470
<i>In the name of the Father...</i>

25
00:04:35.543 --> 00:04:38.980
<i>the Son and the Holy Spirit.</i>

26
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.749
Amen.

27
00:04:51.025 --> 00:04:52.693
Are you going
to the festival?

28
00:04:53.326 --> 00:04:55.362
Ida, you made me jump.

29
00:04:56.197 --> 00:04:58.599
I don't suppose it's your sort
of thing, though, is it, really?

30
00:04:58.733 --> 00:05:00.601
I'm sure we'll go for a bit.

31
00:05:00.735 --> 00:05:03.237
Grace is very excited
about all of it.

32
00:05:05.807 --> 00:05:07.875
All right,
you're all right.

33
00:05:08.408 --> 00:05:10.477
- Hello?
- Hello.

34
00:05:11.746 --> 00:05:14.314
- You're all right.
- Hey.

35
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:16.818
What's this?

36
00:05:17.051 --> 00:05:18.351
Bunbun has bitten her.

37
00:05:18.853 --> 00:05:23.157
Let me see, sweetie.
Mm, not so bad. Here.

38
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.996
Well, unless Bunbun has rabies.

39
00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:31.732
What happens then?

40
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.635
That's when you start
foaming at the mouth.

41
00:05:35.269 --> 00:05:38.005
And you want to bite...
...everybody that you can find!

42
00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:43.010
I don't think you've got rabies.

43
00:05:43.443 --> 00:05:44.745
Go on.

44
00:05:49.584 --> 00:05:51.786
<i>You don't need</i>
<i>to be nervous.</i>

45
00:05:52.086 --> 00:05:53.386
<i>They chose you.</i>

46
00:05:54.255 --> 00:05:55.890
From a lot of people, Grace.

47
00:05:56.023 --> 00:05:57.792
Right.
I'm the Harvest Angel.

48
00:05:58.926 --> 00:06:00.561
There we go.

49
00:06:00.695 --> 00:06:02.230
Will you be wearing your
vicar cape at the celebration?

50
00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:05.465
Not today, sweetie.
It's not a God thing.

51
00:06:05.833 --> 00:06:07.735
But at school they said
that's where we give thanks.

52
00:06:07.869 --> 00:06:11.572
Yeah.
But a different kind of thanks.

53
00:06:12.405 --> 00:06:15.475
It's more like prayers.
Old prayers.

54
00:06:16.476 --> 00:06:17.712
Before God prayers?

55
00:06:19.247 --> 00:06:21.816
No. There was always God.

56
00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:24.252
Just country prayers.

57
00:06:24.585 --> 00:06:25.920
- Berrow prayers.
- Grace:

58
00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.656
Berrow, Berrow, Berrow.

59
00:06:30.892 --> 00:06:32.927
You like it here,
don't you, Gracie?

60
00:06:38.266 --> 00:06:39.432
I like your vicar costume.

61
00:06:39.567 --> 00:06:40.801
Nearly sunset.

62
00:06:40.935 --> 00:06:42.469
We're gonna be late
for the festival!

63
00:06:42.603 --> 00:06:43.938
Okay, kiddo.

64
00:06:48.276 --> 00:06:49.543
Beautiful.

65
00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:23.711
No, no, not those.

66
00:07:23.844 --> 00:07:25.680
Move those,
they're blocking the stage.

67
00:07:25.813 --> 00:07:27.581
- Get those pumpkins out.
- Dave.

68
00:07:27.715 --> 00:07:29.784
The pumpkins are blocking
the stage.

69
00:07:29.917 --> 00:07:32.820
I don't care about pumpkins.
Bloody late as usual.

70
00:07:32.987 --> 00:07:34.588
Looking good, though, isn't it?

71
00:07:34.722 --> 00:07:37.224
Come on, then,
I want that make-up on.

72
00:07:38.491 --> 00:07:40.294
So, after this vicious attack,

73
00:07:40.428 --> 00:07:43.064
do you think we can finally
put Bunbun down?

74
00:07:46.367 --> 00:07:49.704
Jesus, Becca, I can't watch her
every single second of the day.

75
00:07:49.837 --> 00:07:51.505
Well, you need to.

76
00:07:52.873 --> 00:07:54.742
No, I need to work.

77
00:07:55.242 --> 00:07:57.812
Because if I work,
then I can pay for new things.

78
00:07:57.945 --> 00:07:59.413
Yeah, that would be nice.

79
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:02.383
I'm so,
so close to finishing.

80
00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:04.051
Yeah, well, that's good,

81
00:08:04.251 --> 00:08:06.087
because when you're up there,
you're not here.

82
00:08:06.754 --> 00:08:09.090
She's fine. Gracie is fine.

83
00:08:09.223 --> 00:08:13.493
She's a nice, normal little girl
and she's just trying to fit in.

84
00:08:13.661 --> 00:08:14.862
She's settling.

85
00:08:15.062 --> 00:08:17.098
It's been ten months.

86
00:08:17.365 --> 00:08:19.700
Ten months of settling? It's...

87
00:08:19.967 --> 00:08:22.136
Well, maybe she didn't want
to be brought here.

88
00:08:22.269 --> 00:08:25.306
So it's my fault.

89
00:08:32.279 --> 00:08:33.647
No flower thingy.

90
00:08:35.349 --> 00:08:37.451
- Problem child.
- That's your fault.

91
00:08:37.618 --> 00:08:39.320
That's true. If you want,

92
00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:42.690
I'll stay here
and guard the house,

93
00:08:42.857 --> 00:08:44.492
while you go
to the creepy festival.

94
00:08:44.625 --> 00:08:46.260
- You can wear that.
- Thank you.

95
00:08:46.394 --> 00:08:48.662
Is there any other pagan crap

96
00:08:48.796 --> 00:08:50.965
that we've forgotten
that we need to bring today,

97
00:08:51.098 --> 00:08:53.634
or is it just the death mask?

98
00:08:53.968 --> 00:08:56.303
Let the festivities begin.

99
00:09:10.684 --> 00:09:13.220
Thomas, nearly time.

100
00:10:26.327 --> 00:10:27.361
Hi.

101
00:11:05.299 --> 00:11:06.535
Oh!

102
00:11:07.301 --> 00:11:10.137
- Beer?
- I'll have what they're having.

103
00:11:11.939 --> 00:11:13.941
- Mrs. Vicar! Two minutes.
- Rebecca!

104
00:11:14.074 --> 00:11:16.578
Hello, my lovers.

105
00:11:17.077 --> 00:11:19.548
- Bryony, you look fab.
- Is Grace around?

106
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.416
Well, she's here somewhere,
I think she's waiting for you.

107
00:11:24.251 --> 00:11:25.719
Bryony hasn't been able
to stop talking

108
00:11:25.853 --> 00:11:27.388
about Grace's
harvest angel costume.

109
00:11:27.522 --> 00:11:29.456
The dreaded harvest angel.

110
00:11:41.101 --> 00:11:42.703
Afternoon, Mrs. Vicar.

111
00:11:42.836 --> 00:11:44.171
Wow!

112
00:11:44.305 --> 00:11:45.806
Are you going all beardy weirdy
on us as well?

113
00:11:46.006 --> 00:11:48.342
A little bit weirdy,
not so beardy, I hope.

114
00:11:48.475 --> 00:11:50.344
All right,
come on, Mr. Vicar.

115
00:11:50.477 --> 00:11:52.614
Come on, one for the camera.
Let's go.

116
00:11:52.746 --> 00:11:54.715
- Give us a kiss, Mrs Vicar.
- Oh!

117
00:12:17.838 --> 00:12:19.273
- To the harvest.
- To the harvest.

118
00:12:19.406 --> 00:12:20.709
Cheers!

119
00:13:15.362 --> 00:13:17.398
Don't forget your lines, Dave!

120
00:13:17.532 --> 00:13:21.302
Cheers. The day has come.
The stage is set.

121
00:13:21.835 --> 00:13:24.706
The harvest is done.

122
00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:29.910
But who will lead us
on this merry dance?

123
00:13:30.377 --> 00:13:31.646
Who do we call?

124
00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:34.214
Lord of Misrule!

125
00:13:34.415 --> 00:13:36.116
Behold.

126
00:13:41.388 --> 00:13:44.759
The Lord of Misrule
has answered your calls.

127
00:13:51.965 --> 00:13:53.267
Who is it?

128
00:14:11.085 --> 00:14:14.955
My loves. My dears.

129
00:14:16.056 --> 00:14:18.727
I am not just here
to lead us on a journey.

130
00:14:19.026 --> 00:14:22.896
I am also here
to protect us from another.

131
00:14:28.737 --> 00:14:31.205
He is the harvest blight.

132
00:14:31.539 --> 00:14:34.408
He is the rocks in the woods
and the burrows,

133
00:14:34.743 --> 00:14:36.243
and I am here today

134
00:14:36.377 --> 00:14:38.379
to drive him out!

135
00:14:43.651 --> 00:14:44.853
Cry his name,

136
00:14:45.285 --> 00:14:49.123
and show him
that you are not afraid.

137
00:14:50.558 --> 00:14:52.459
Gallowgog.

138
00:14:52.727 --> 00:14:54.094
Gallowgog.

139
00:14:54.395 --> 00:14:57.599
Gallowgog! Gallowgog!

140
00:14:57.732 --> 00:15:01.301
- Gallowgog! Gallowgog!
- Gallowgog! Gallowgog!

141
00:15:01.435 --> 00:15:03.203
- Gallowgog! Gallowgog!
- Gallowgog! Gallowgog!

142
00:15:13.313 --> 00:15:16.350
Gallowgog, be gone!

143
00:15:18.385 --> 00:15:20.254
Gallowgog! Gallowgog!

144
00:16:01.962 --> 00:16:04.331
Grace? Grace!

145
00:16:05.299 --> 00:16:06.534
Your flowers.

146
00:16:07.702 --> 00:16:09.970
Thanks, Mum. I love you.

147
00:16:10.538 --> 00:16:11.438
Love you, too.

148
00:16:14.909 --> 00:16:15.844
Hello?

149
00:16:15.976 --> 00:16:17.277
Hello, Vicar.

150
00:16:17.411 --> 00:16:20.113
- Miri, Ida, nice to see you.
- You too.

151
00:16:20.247 --> 00:16:22.449
Bit of a thing, isn't it?

152
00:16:22.617 --> 00:16:24.184
I didn't know Berrow had
a demon.

153
00:16:24.318 --> 00:16:26.754
Miri and Ida:

154
00:16:26.888 --> 00:16:29.456
I think the idea is
that we drive him out,

155
00:16:29.591 --> 00:16:32.159
and then we bless the harvest,
and all will be well.

156
00:16:32.292 --> 00:16:34.261
Funny way to drive him out,

157
00:16:34.394 --> 00:16:36.598
it seems more like
we're dancing with him.

158
00:16:39.968 --> 00:16:43.136
Gallowgog, be gone.

159
00:16:43.303 --> 00:16:45.907
Misrule stands triumphant!

160
00:16:49.076 --> 00:16:51.111
Time to revel in chaos.

161
00:16:51.345 --> 00:16:54.816
- The feast of fools has begun.
- Crowd:

162
00:17:15.235 --> 00:17:16.504
Grace?

163
00:17:26.113 --> 00:17:27.381
Grace?

164
00:17:30.484 --> 00:17:32.720
Hair, blood, fire, sun.

165
00:17:32.854 --> 00:17:33.788
Bryony, hey.

166
00:17:33.922 --> 00:17:35.455
Hair, blood, fire, sun.

167
00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:38.091
- Hair, blood, fire, sun.
- Have you seen Grace, Bryony?

168
00:17:38.225 --> 00:17:40.193
Hair, blood, fire, sun.

169
00:17:41.128 --> 00:17:42.630
Where is she, lovely?

170
00:17:43.798 --> 00:17:45.132
She's away now.

171
00:17:47.702 --> 00:17:50.203
- What did you say?
- Grace.

172
00:17:51.305 --> 00:17:52.707
She's away now.

173
00:18:14.529 --> 00:18:16.898
Actually, it's all right.
I managed to...

174
00:18:17.031 --> 00:18:18.231
Have you seen Grace?

175
00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:20.835
- Yeah. Yeah, she was over...
- Where?

176
00:18:21.468 --> 00:18:22.604
- She was just...
- Show me. Where?

177
00:18:22.737 --> 00:18:24.204
She was over here.
She was with...

178
00:18:24.338 --> 00:18:26.273
- Gallowgog.
- I can't find her anywhere.

179
00:18:39.252 --> 00:18:41.656
Grace!

180
00:18:42.757 --> 00:18:44.892
- Where are you going?
- Grace:

181
00:18:50.565 --> 00:18:51.633
Grace!

182
00:19:05.379 --> 00:19:08.583
I've never been this far before.

183
00:19:09.083 --> 00:19:10.652
Grace, slow...

184
00:19:50.124 --> 00:19:51.224
Grace.

185
00:19:59.801 --> 00:20:01.234
I know you're exhausted,

186
00:20:01.502 --> 00:20:03.705
but we have to go through this
one more time.

187
00:20:04.539 --> 00:20:06.473
So, tell me again
what you remember.

188
00:20:07.675 --> 00:20:11.045
It was loud and busy.
I saw her going into the trees

189
00:20:11.179 --> 00:20:12.513
at the top of the field
with that man.

190
00:20:12.647 --> 00:20:14.649
And that's when
you went after her?

191
00:20:15.783 --> 00:20:18.953
Yeah. Like I said,
it was confusing. I...

192
00:20:19.921 --> 00:20:21.856
I thought I heard her,
but I couldn't keep up,

193
00:20:21.989 --> 00:20:23.725
and that was when I got
completely turned around,

194
00:20:23.858 --> 00:20:25.760
and I told you,
I fell into a holloway.

195
00:20:25.893 --> 00:20:28.129
That's where I hit my head,
and everything was...

196
00:20:28.963 --> 00:20:31.498
Yeah, we checked.
There was no holloway.

197
00:20:31.733 --> 00:20:37.237
No. It... It was there.
The... The trees, those...

198
00:20:38.371 --> 00:20:40.373
poppets, they were dangling
from the trees.

199
00:20:40.875 --> 00:20:42.944
My point is that if I got lost
in there,

200
00:20:43.077 --> 00:20:44.145
then maybe she did, too.

201
00:20:44.277 --> 00:20:45.713
- She could be...
- Sorry.

202
00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:47.849
Tea.

203
00:20:54.622 --> 00:20:56.991
So, this man, the one
who looked like a demon...

204
00:20:57.357 --> 00:20:59.493
He was dressed like a demon.

205
00:21:00.061 --> 00:21:01.596
Like the festival's...

206
00:21:02.329 --> 00:21:03.831
"Gallo" something.

207
00:21:04.098 --> 00:21:05.265
Surely you must know it, the...

208
00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.068
Is there something
better you can do

209
00:21:07.201 --> 00:21:09.103
than just ask the same
questions over and over again?

210
00:21:09.302 --> 00:21:11.639
It's been about a dozen times
you've asked the same thing.

211
00:21:11.873 --> 00:21:13.641
I assure you,
we're doing everything we can

212
00:21:13.775 --> 00:21:15.475
- to find your daughter.
- Are you?

213
00:21:15.843 --> 00:21:19.113
Shouldn't there be dogs,
or helicopters, or...

214
00:21:19.412 --> 00:21:21.281
Anything.

215
00:21:30.423 --> 00:21:31.859
Oh, we forgot Bunbun.

216
00:21:37.131 --> 00:21:38.465
He needs feeding.

217
00:21:44.639 --> 00:21:47.307
Just give her a bit of time.
She needs to settle.

218
00:21:50.611 --> 00:21:52.046
- Settle?
- Sorry.

219
00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:54.182
That came out wrong.

220
00:21:54.916 --> 00:21:56.584
How was it supposed
to come out?

221
00:22:16.403 --> 00:22:18.438
You need to eat something,
lovely.

222
00:22:19.207 --> 00:22:20.808
I'll manage. Thank you.

223
00:22:23.343 --> 00:22:26.047
What... What are you doing?

224
00:22:32.153 --> 00:22:33.221
Becca.

225
00:22:33.621 --> 00:22:36.389
- Oh, hello.
- What are you going to do?

226
00:22:39.594 --> 00:22:40.862
Give me that!

227
00:22:47.201 --> 00:22:49.369
Out. Get out now!

228
00:22:50.104 --> 00:22:51.873
- Becca?
- Reverend Holland,

229
00:22:52.006 --> 00:22:55.576
we just need some of her things
for the search, for the dogs.

230
00:23:01.414 --> 00:23:03.951
Oh, merciful Lord,
lighten our darkness,

231
00:23:04.085 --> 00:23:07.722
and in your mercy defend us
against the perils of this day.

232
00:23:09.056 --> 00:23:10.024
For the love of your Son

233
00:23:10.157 --> 00:23:12.526
and our Savior Jesus Christ.
Amen.

234
00:24:04.245 --> 00:24:06.580
Find me.

235
00:24:41.682 --> 00:24:43.250
Grace!

236
00:24:51.292 --> 00:24:52.560
Grace!

237
00:24:57.198 --> 00:24:58.566
Grace!

238
00:25:31.132 --> 00:25:32.266
Grace!

239
00:25:35.369 --> 00:25:36.637
Grace!

240
00:25:46.313 --> 00:25:48.282
<i>Becca,</i>
<i>I'm with the police.</i>

241
00:25:49.016 --> 00:25:50.651
<i>We found something.</i>

242
00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:07.768
Show me.

243
00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:27.522
<i>Don't go too far, Gracie.</i>

244
00:26:30.157 --> 00:26:32.393
<i>Bryony!</i>

245
00:26:32.527 --> 00:26:33.794
<i>It's almost time!</i>

246
00:27:10.731 --> 00:27:13.868
So, what happens next?

247
00:27:14.068 --> 00:27:15.269
We'll get him.

248
00:27:15.436 --> 00:27:16.704
In a small village,
with that tattoo,

249
00:27:16.837 --> 00:27:18.005
we'll find him in no time.

250
00:27:18.839 --> 00:27:21.709
This is a major breakthrough,
Reverend Holland. A good thing.

251
00:27:22.109 --> 00:27:24.345
I believe if we find him,
we find your daughter.

252
00:27:31.318 --> 00:27:33.687
<i>Bryony! Come on!</i>

253
00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:38.125
Come on. Let's go.

254
00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:41.128
Thank you.

255
00:27:51.005 --> 00:27:54.074
Okay, we can't
just sit here in the quiet.

256
00:27:54.842 --> 00:27:56.477
Come on, we need to be
around people.

257
00:27:56.611 --> 00:28:00.080
Let's... Let's go
and get something to eat.

258
00:28:01.315 --> 00:28:02.349
Come on.

259
00:28:06.487 --> 00:28:07.721
Please.

260
00:28:24.573 --> 00:28:29.076
Mrs. Vicar, Mr. Vicar.
Very pleased to see you.

261
00:28:32.446 --> 00:28:35.617
Come here now.
I know what you need.

262
00:28:41.822 --> 00:28:43.824
Have a drink. Sit down.

263
00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:47.596
Do you want a pint, love?

264
00:28:47.795 --> 00:28:48.862
Templeton.

265
00:28:49.096 --> 00:28:50.397
Pint of Templeton.

266
00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.735
Terrible thing that's happened,

267
00:28:54.868 --> 00:28:58.072
but you'll see
how things'll be right again.

268
00:28:59.608 --> 00:29:02.009
Well, all is as was.

269
00:29:06.814 --> 00:29:09.083
I've heard the police
are out in force tonight.

270
00:29:09.383 --> 00:29:11.352
They'll have your chiddler back
in no time.

271
00:29:11.785 --> 00:29:13.053
Yeah.

272
00:29:13.854 --> 00:29:14.922
Dave, mate.

273
00:29:15.055 --> 00:29:16.890
At the festival,
there was a bloke

274
00:29:17.024 --> 00:29:19.226
in a Gallowgog mask.

275
00:29:19.594 --> 00:29:21.028
Oh, yeah. I know him.

276
00:29:21.295 --> 00:29:23.632
- Who's that then?
- Derry Nash.

277
00:29:24.031 --> 00:29:27.101
Funny lad from a funny breed.

278
00:29:27.268 --> 00:29:30.070
Lives with his grandad
up on Cromwell Bend.

279
00:29:30.371 --> 00:29:33.807
Doesn't leave their farm much,
not these days.

280
00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:37.712
Does he have a tattoo
on his hand like this?

281
00:29:37.845 --> 00:29:38.979
That's the bit.

282
00:29:50.824 --> 00:29:52.092
Right here.

283
00:30:05.139 --> 00:30:06.840
- Five minutes.
- Okay.

284
00:30:23.924 --> 00:30:25.192
Hello?

285
00:31:17.077 --> 00:31:18.912
What are you doing
on my property?

286
00:31:21.148 --> 00:31:22.983
Mr. Nash.

287
00:31:26.521 --> 00:31:29.123
I just wanted to talk to you
about your grandson.

288
00:31:31.458 --> 00:31:33.961
- He ain't here.
- He's in there, isn't he?

289
00:31:34.094 --> 00:31:36.096
Derry ain't here!

290
00:31:37.665 --> 00:31:40.167
Hey!

291
00:31:40.968 --> 00:31:43.904
Stop, stop. Calm down.
Calm down!

292
00:31:45.339 --> 00:31:47.207
Derry?

293
00:32:28.048 --> 00:32:30.984
Who stands in the fields
and waits?

294
00:32:37.892 --> 00:32:39.727
There's something
they're not telling us.

295
00:32:39.861 --> 00:32:41.061
I can feel it.

296
00:32:45.232 --> 00:32:47.100
We... We have to get back
out there.

297
00:32:47.234 --> 00:32:48.335
Becca, please.

298
00:32:48.469 --> 00:32:50.404
Someone needs to find him.

299
00:32:52.907 --> 00:32:55.442
We just have to let the police
do their job.

300
00:32:57.344 --> 00:32:58.713
That's all we have to do.

301
00:32:59.714 --> 00:33:03.217
- We're not alone in this.
- Yes, we are.

302
00:33:04.652 --> 00:33:05.753
We are alone.

303
00:33:07.922 --> 00:33:10.991
We came here to be with God,
but God is far away from here.

304
00:33:15.897 --> 00:33:17.264
I guess He is.

305
00:34:30.738 --> 00:34:31.739
Gracie?

306
00:34:36.076 --> 00:34:37.311
Grace?

307
00:35:08.408 --> 00:35:10.511
Becca?

308
00:35:27.194 --> 00:35:28.462
What is it?

309
00:35:34.035 --> 00:35:35.402
I need to talk to them.

310
00:36:26.554 --> 00:36:28.856
I'm so glad to see
so many of you today.

311
00:36:41.435 --> 00:36:43.104
Two days ago,
my daughter, Grace,

312
00:36:43.303 --> 00:36:46.007
went missing
at the harvest festival.

313
00:36:47.041 --> 00:36:50.745
We haven't lived here long,
but many of you know Grace.

314
00:36:53.948 --> 00:36:55.248
Which means you...

315
00:36:57.819 --> 00:37:00.988
Which means you know
how much it hurts.

316
00:37:01.488 --> 00:37:04.058
We can help, Mrs. Vicar.
We can... Can't we have...

317
00:37:04.192 --> 00:37:05.425
- A vigil.
- A vigil. Yeah.

318
00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:06.861
A vigil for Grace
to tell her she's loved.

319
00:37:07.494 --> 00:37:08.763
That's a lovely idea.

320
00:37:09.097 --> 00:37:10.732
Somebody should give
the Nash family what for.

321
00:37:10.865 --> 00:37:13.300
Oh, that'll be you,
will it, Dave Garfoot?

322
00:37:13.433 --> 00:37:14.702
Now...

323
00:37:15.002 --> 00:37:16.604
Now, the police are dealing
with the Nash family.

324
00:37:16.738 --> 00:37:19.006
I'll have no recrimination,
not in Grace's name.

325
00:37:22.442 --> 00:37:24.979
I've called you here today
to share hope.

326
00:37:27.247 --> 00:37:28.816
I've seen Grace.

327
00:37:31.418 --> 00:37:34.522
And I believe
that God brought her to me.

328
00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:37.759
I know she's alive,

329
00:37:37.925 --> 00:37:40.661
but I also know
that she's desperately afraid.

330
00:37:41.629 --> 00:37:44.498
And more than anything,
she wants us to bring her home.

331
00:37:47.568 --> 00:37:49.070
I need your prayers.

332
00:37:49.704 --> 00:37:53.908
To guide her.
Now, please, pray with me.

333
00:37:58.579 --> 00:37:59.814
No.

334
00:38:04.886 --> 00:38:06.954
There will be no hope
from your Lord.

335
00:38:08.956 --> 00:38:11.491
Who do you think has gifted you
visions of your daughter?

336
00:38:11.893 --> 00:38:14.262
- Jocelyn, just leave it.
- No, it's okay. It's okay.

337
00:38:14.394 --> 00:38:15.797
No, it's fine.

338
00:38:18.331 --> 00:38:20.467
Your Lord does not have
your child.

339
00:38:20.968 --> 00:38:23.336
Nor the Nashes,
nor any other human soul.

340
00:38:24.205 --> 00:38:27.608
Then tell me,
who has taken my daughter?

341
00:38:28.976 --> 00:38:32.580
Every year, we drive him out,
and yet he's still here.

342
00:38:33.881 --> 00:38:36.517
He stands in the fields
and waits.

343
00:38:37.317 --> 00:38:39.654
He stands in the fields
and watches.

344
00:38:40.721 --> 00:38:42.924
And now, he has taken his tithe.

345
00:38:48.361 --> 00:38:50.164
Two days have passed.

346
00:38:50.665 --> 00:38:52.099
All is as was.

347
00:38:56.938 --> 00:38:58.471
All is as was.

348
00:39:04.745 --> 00:39:06.981
Let us pray.

349
00:39:15.089 --> 00:39:16.224
Hello, Rebecca?

350
00:39:16.757 --> 00:39:18.693
- Hello?
- Anyone in?

351
00:39:19.359 --> 00:39:20.360
Hello. Here you go.

352
00:39:20.493 --> 00:39:21.762
How we doing, Mr. Vicar?

353
00:39:21.896 --> 00:39:23.531
- Thank you.
- Darling. Where is she?

354
00:39:23.798 --> 00:39:25.533
- She's there.
- How we doing? We all right?

355
00:39:25.666 --> 00:39:28.002
Hello, love. Let me make you
something to eat.

356
00:39:29.337 --> 00:39:30.705
- These are for you, mate.
- Right.

357
00:39:30.838 --> 00:39:32.240
You get these
down your neck, okay?

358
00:39:32.372 --> 00:39:34.175
- Oh, well. I'll try my best.
- You do it, yeah?

359
00:39:34.441 --> 00:39:38.079
I've been thinking about
the candlelit vigil for Gracie.

360
00:39:38.212 --> 00:39:40.447
- Right, okay.
- And I was thinking,

361
00:39:40.715 --> 00:39:42.516
we could put together
some flyers.

362
00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:45.418
Uh, I don't know
if that would be the best idea

363
00:39:45.553 --> 00:39:47.121
just because
of what happened today.

364
00:39:47.255 --> 00:39:50.057
Hang on. Jocelyn Abney, listen,
I want to apologize for that.

365
00:39:50.191 --> 00:39:51.659
It's nonsense
what happened today.

366
00:39:51.792 --> 00:39:54.528
You got that? Yeah?
It's nonsense, mate.

367
00:39:54.762 --> 00:39:56.864
Oh, God. Eggs are off.

368
00:40:01.535 --> 00:40:04.404
- Hello.
- Wasn't he good?

369
00:40:04.538 --> 00:40:06.439
The whole family
has arrived.

370
00:40:06.607 --> 00:40:08.509
- Where is she?
- She's just in...

371
00:40:12.412 --> 00:40:14.715
I'll do an omelet
and I'll do some casserole.

372
00:40:14.849 --> 00:40:17.484
- Let me get some plates.
- How are you, dear?

373
00:40:21.889 --> 00:40:25.026
Just try not to be scared, love.

374
00:40:26.894 --> 00:40:28.996
She wouldn't want you
to be scared.

375
00:40:32.199 --> 00:40:33.567
Miri, she's in here!

376
00:40:34.001 --> 00:40:37.238
Two cakes.

377
00:40:39.874 --> 00:40:41.242
This one's chocolate.

378
00:40:42.009 --> 00:40:44.045
Right,
who's sitting where? Come on.

379
00:40:48.616 --> 00:40:50.284
Sit down, come on, let's go.

380
00:40:50.418 --> 00:40:53.988
- You must be starving.
- I am, I'm starving. Come on.

381
00:40:59.961 --> 00:41:01.996
I guess that this is just
their way of...

382
00:41:03.264 --> 00:41:04.665
trying to be helpful.

383
00:41:07.835 --> 00:41:09.637
Still, I suppose their hearts
are in the right place,

384
00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:11.471
- aren't they?
- Hmm.

385
00:41:12.873 --> 00:41:14.942
Old families come visiting.

386
00:41:17.477 --> 00:41:22.883
This vigil thing...
Are you really up for that?

387
00:41:24.685 --> 00:41:25.987
I don't know.

388
00:41:27.487 --> 00:41:28.990
Might be good for the community.

389
00:41:32.059 --> 00:41:34.061
I just really, really don't
want you to get into

390
00:41:34.228 --> 00:41:37.999
some kind of pissing contest
with this Abney bloke.

391
00:41:38.132 --> 00:41:40.401
I'm not worried about
that fucking man, okay?

392
00:41:40.835 --> 00:41:42.236
I'm worried about our daughter.

393
00:42:34.355 --> 00:42:35.524
Bugger it.

394
00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:37.858
I'll get a different one.

395
00:42:39.727 --> 00:42:40.961
Ida?

396
00:42:42.696 --> 00:42:45.499
Ida, dear, eggs are off.
We need more eggs.

397
00:42:45.833 --> 00:42:47.068
I'm busy.

398
00:42:47.201 --> 00:42:49.036
Do you want
your sponge cake or not?

399
00:42:53.941 --> 00:42:56.811
And how are my little girls
today?

400
00:43:03.084 --> 00:43:04.952
And what have you got for me?

401
00:43:13.594 --> 00:43:18.732
Come on now, little darlings.
This is not very funny.

402
00:44:00.474 --> 00:44:02.877
Okay, sweetheart, your turn.

403
00:44:04.445 --> 00:44:06.780
- Ready, sweetheart?
- Come on.

404
00:44:08.182 --> 00:44:09.216
Ready.

405
00:44:43.317 --> 00:44:45.853
Ida?

406
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:51.058
He stands in the field.

407
00:44:52.193 --> 00:44:53.260
Ida?

408
00:44:54.629 --> 00:44:55.896
Are you okay, love?

409
00:44:57.464 --> 00:44:58.533
It's Rebecca.

410
00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:02.970
- Ida, what's the matter?
- Oh, oh!

411
00:45:03.103 --> 00:45:04.705
Ida, come on.

412
00:45:05.507 --> 00:45:06.941
Are you okay?

413
00:45:10.512 --> 00:45:13.347
Idie! Wherever did you go?

414
00:45:13.615 --> 00:45:17.885
Don't be silly, Miri, dear.
I was visiting the chickens.

415
00:45:19.787 --> 00:45:22.089
Okay. Okay.

416
00:45:24.425 --> 00:45:27.294
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay, Miri.

417
00:45:28.262 --> 00:45:32.466
Are you here to take your walk,
vicar, dear?

418
00:45:38.372 --> 00:45:41.509
Maybe we should visit
the chickens together.

419
00:45:43.744 --> 00:45:44.979
No, Ida, love.

420
00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:48.282
I just thought I'd come and say
a little prayer with you.

421
00:45:50.884 --> 00:45:53.420
I don't think
he'd like that at all.

422
00:45:57.592 --> 00:46:00.595
Lord, we pray that you will
comfort us in our suffering.

423
00:46:07.401 --> 00:46:09.436
Lend skill to the hands
of our healers

424
00:46:09.571 --> 00:46:11.872
and bless the means
used for our cure.

425
00:46:17.244 --> 00:46:19.179
Give us such confidence
in the power of your grace

426
00:46:19.313 --> 00:46:21.048
that even when we are afraid...

427
00:46:23.652 --> 00:46:25.252
Are you afraid, vicar?

428
00:46:29.023 --> 00:46:33.460
- Even when we are afraid...
- Are you afraid?

429
00:46:36.665 --> 00:46:37.965
He's here.

430
00:46:40.934 --> 00:46:42.169
Look at him.

431
00:46:49.343 --> 00:46:50.645
The Lord is my Shepherd...

432
00:46:50.779 --> 00:46:52.146
Look at him!

433
00:47:18.205 --> 00:47:20.742
- He restores my soul...
- Prince of Goats...

434
00:47:21.241 --> 00:47:23.712
He stands... He stands...

435
00:47:24.211 --> 00:47:27.981
He stands in the fields
and he waits!

436
00:47:28.115 --> 00:47:31.185
Ida, no!

437
00:47:31.753 --> 00:47:34.988
All is as was.

438
00:47:37.792 --> 00:47:39.226
All is as was.

439
00:48:30.978 --> 00:48:32.881
Funny time,
this part of the year.

440
00:48:33.681 --> 00:48:35.916
Harvest festival gets everyone
worked up.

441
00:48:36.651 --> 00:48:39.253
Four days of feasting
while the sun begins to die.

442
00:48:39.854 --> 00:48:42.891
Four days of mischief
while the lord is wild.

443
00:48:43.357 --> 00:48:45.426
And all to be blessed by him.

444
00:48:46.594 --> 00:48:47.896
You mean your demon?

445
00:48:48.228 --> 00:48:50.964
No, not a demon.

446
00:48:52.734 --> 00:48:55.269
Gallowgog is a spirit
of the land.

447
00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:58.773
The breeze that flattens
the grass in the field,

448
00:48:59.106 --> 00:49:00.307
that's his footsteps.

449
00:49:00.909 --> 00:49:03.377
The feeling you get
when you stand in the woods

450
00:49:03.511 --> 00:49:05.547
that you're never alone,
that's his breath.

451
00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:08.048
You're starting to sound
like Jocelyn Abney.

452
00:49:08.482 --> 00:49:10.484
That's 'cause we've read
the same book.

453
00:49:11.185 --> 00:49:12.654
We've read it
since we were kids.

454
00:49:12.921 --> 00:49:14.321
It's our local folklore.

455
00:49:14.689 --> 00:49:17.424
It's all in here.

456
00:49:18.292 --> 00:49:19.594
There we are.

457
00:49:24.331 --> 00:49:29.838
"In 1621, the Lord of Misrule,
a man named Tobias Bron,

458
00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:32.540
claimed he was contacted
by Gallowgog."

459
00:49:34.876 --> 00:49:37.679
"This great spirit promised
to bless the town with miracles.

460
00:49:39.781 --> 00:49:42.750
The old families rejoiced
at these wonders.

461
00:49:43.518 --> 00:49:45.520
In return,
Tobias instructed the villagers

462
00:49:45.653 --> 00:49:47.988
to build a great Black Barn
for Gallowgog,

463
00:49:48.188 --> 00:49:49.757
where they left gifts
and offerings."

464
00:49:50.825 --> 00:49:53.227
Seems an odd way
to give things to God.

465
00:49:54.294 --> 00:49:57.064
Rebecca,
you have to understand

466
00:49:57.197 --> 00:49:59.233
that they left offerings.

467
00:49:59.834 --> 00:50:01.201
Their children.

468
00:50:02.904 --> 00:50:06.541
Nobody knows how many
young souls they sacrificed.

469
00:50:13.848 --> 00:50:15.015
Who's this?

470
00:50:15.249 --> 00:50:16.885
People who didn't believe
in Gallowgog?

471
00:50:17.084 --> 00:50:18.720
No, dear.
That's Tobias Bron

472
00:50:18.853 --> 00:50:20.020
and his followers.

473
00:50:20.487 --> 00:50:22.155
When the Church learned
of their heresy,

474
00:50:22.289 --> 00:50:24.258
they came to Berrow
and executed them.

475
00:50:24.726 --> 00:50:25.727
As you can imagine,

476
00:50:26.159 --> 00:50:28.295
that was the end of Spirit
Gallowgog and the festival.

477
00:50:29.329 --> 00:50:30.698
Years ago,
the old families brought

478
00:50:30.832 --> 00:50:33.601
the celebration back,
a heritage thing.

479
00:50:34.234 --> 00:50:35.837
Of course, they changed it so...

480
00:50:36.403 --> 00:50:37.705
Now, we're chasing the demon out

481
00:50:37.839 --> 00:50:40.140
instead of welcoming him in.

482
00:50:41.074 --> 00:50:42.810
But he still comes back
every year.

483
00:50:45.245 --> 00:50:47.682
He stands in the fields
and waits.

484
00:50:48.850 --> 00:50:52.319
That's what Jocelyn Abney says
to any poor sod who'll listen.

485
00:50:52.452 --> 00:50:54.254
Now, you watch your step
with him.

486
00:50:55.088 --> 00:50:56.558
There's a darkness in that man

487
00:50:56.724 --> 00:50:59.326
that comes from the same place
as your loss.

488
00:51:02.262 --> 00:51:03.831
Dearie, you don't know, do you?

489
00:51:06.333 --> 00:51:07.669
Grace wasn't the first.

490
00:51:08.703 --> 00:51:10.672
- What?
- Twelve years ago,

491
00:51:10.905 --> 00:51:15.342
Thomas Abney, he went missing
on the harvest festival,

492
00:51:15.944 --> 00:51:17.177
just like Grace.

493
00:51:17.645 --> 00:51:19.212
They searched for four days

494
00:51:19.346 --> 00:51:21.448
and never found
that poor boy's body.

495
00:51:26.219 --> 00:51:28.523
- I'm so sorry.
- Ida:

496
00:51:28.856 --> 00:51:31.960
He took Thomas and Grace
for a walk,

497
00:51:32.392 --> 00:51:34.494
so they would know him.

498
00:51:35.128 --> 00:51:37.197
He will do the same
for you soon.

499
00:51:37.832 --> 00:51:42.537
Off to the Black Barn with you.
Off to the Black Barn you go!

500
00:51:42.804 --> 00:51:47.542
Off to the Black Barn you go!
Off to the Black Barn you go!

501
00:51:47.675 --> 00:51:53.380
Off to the Black Barn with you!
Off to the Black Barn you go!

502
00:51:59.854 --> 00:52:02.557
Reverend Holland?
Are you all right?

503
00:52:03.524 --> 00:52:07.227
It's Ida Tremlow.
She's not been feeling well.

504
00:52:09.931 --> 00:52:12.033
Well, we are gearing up
for another search for Grace.

505
00:52:12.299 --> 00:52:13.968
Why didn't you tell me
there was another?

506
00:52:14.334 --> 00:52:16.571
- Another? Another what?
- Thomas Abney.

507
00:52:16.804 --> 00:52:18.940
Twelve years ago, he went
missing, just like Grace.

508
00:52:19.641 --> 00:52:21.174
Someone should've told us.

509
00:52:21.809 --> 00:52:23.578
I wanted to know
what happened to him.

510
00:52:23.878 --> 00:52:25.079
Trust me.

511
00:52:25.345 --> 00:52:27.414
You don't want to know
the details of that case.

512
00:52:28.181 --> 00:52:30.450
I don't want you to become
another Jocelyn Abney.

513
00:52:30.585 --> 00:52:32.654
Excuse me.

514
00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:34.656
Clive?

515
00:52:35.056 --> 00:52:37.125
You sure it's him? On my way.

516
00:52:37.625 --> 00:52:39.159
Look after Miss Tremlow.

517
00:52:39.894 --> 00:52:41.696
You've got him,
haven't you?

518
00:52:41.829 --> 00:52:43.163
Go home,
Reverend Holland.

519
00:52:43.296 --> 00:52:44.799
Please, go home.

520
00:53:21.936 --> 00:53:23.203
Jocelyn?

521
00:53:40.021 --> 00:53:40.922
Jocelyn?

522
00:53:49.597 --> 00:53:51.766
I don't recall inviting you
into my house.

523
00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:54.501
I'm not here about today.

524
00:53:57.437 --> 00:53:59.406
I want to talk to you
about Thomas.

525
00:54:01.441 --> 00:54:02.710
I know about him.

526
00:54:04.478 --> 00:54:07.314
How he went, just like Grace.

527
00:54:08.281 --> 00:54:09.717
That's what you know, is it?

528
00:54:11.652 --> 00:54:13.521
He's why you're so scared,
isn't he?

529
00:54:14.722 --> 00:54:17.225
Because that's the worst part
about losing a child.

530
00:54:18.526 --> 00:54:20.828
It's all the terrible thoughts

531
00:54:20.962 --> 00:54:22.563
about what might have happened
to them.

532
00:54:23.296 --> 00:54:26.033
And you've lived with this pain
for a long time now.

533
00:54:26.333 --> 00:54:28.301
Thomas, Thomas, Thomas.

534
00:54:29.070 --> 00:54:31.906
- She presumes to know me.
- Jocelyn.

535
00:54:32.907 --> 00:54:36.611
You're scaring people.
You have to stop.

536
00:54:37.812 --> 00:54:41.414
How can I stop something
that I didn't start?

537
00:54:43.651 --> 00:54:45.352
Then who started it?

538
00:54:49.090 --> 00:54:52.392
I'd like to know more,
if you'd speak with me.

539
00:54:54.262 --> 00:54:55.495
Please.

540
00:54:57.464 --> 00:54:58.800
Would you like some tea?

541
00:55:07.407 --> 00:55:09.277
Thomas was an odd boy.

542
00:55:10.044 --> 00:55:13.480
Grace must have been so excited
to be chosen as harvest angel.

543
00:55:14.148 --> 00:55:17.317
I know Thomas was
the year he went away.

544
00:55:17.785 --> 00:55:20.353
You must be very sad
at this time of year.

545
00:55:21.222 --> 00:55:23.024
No, not really.

546
00:55:24.525 --> 00:55:29.396
He was always
a celebratory type.

547
00:55:30.397 --> 00:55:31.666
Biscuits.

548
00:56:00.294 --> 00:56:02.964
Don't touch that, please.

549
00:56:04.131 --> 00:56:05.066
Sorry.

550
00:56:07.768 --> 00:56:11.438
Who... Who is that boy,
with Thomas, at the festival?

551
00:56:11.873 --> 00:56:14.742
The Nash boy.

552
00:56:16.043 --> 00:56:18.112
They were friends?
Well, you know that Derry Nash,

553
00:56:18.246 --> 00:56:20.748
he has something to do
with Grace's disappearance.

554
00:56:21.448 --> 00:56:24.685
Maybe there's a connection,
another way to see this.

555
00:56:25.485 --> 00:56:26.854
Oh, yes. There is.

556
00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:29.690
Gallowgog will show you.
You'll see.

557
00:56:29.824 --> 00:56:33.361
- No, I didn't mean like that.
- Like back at your church,

558
00:56:33.493 --> 00:56:36.664
where... your Grace
came to visit you.

559
00:56:38.733 --> 00:56:41.235
A demon didn't take
our children.

560
00:56:41.836 --> 00:56:45.039
It was a person. A bad person.

561
00:56:48.776 --> 00:56:50.578
You take me for a fool, do you?

562
00:56:50.845 --> 00:56:53.948
You think I would spit
on Spirit Gallowgog's truth?

563
00:56:54.548 --> 00:56:59.854
Truth?
It's just an old story.

564
00:57:00.453 --> 00:57:02.623
You don't believe
in old stories?

565
00:57:03.090 --> 00:57:05.927
Yet you cling to one and preach
its gospel, do you not?

566
00:57:06.459 --> 00:57:09.096
You're just clinging
to so much fear.

567
00:57:10.231 --> 00:57:12.199
Do I look afraid to you, vicar?

568
00:57:13.401 --> 00:57:14.969
No, you look lost.

569
00:57:16.704 --> 00:57:17.838
And tired.

570
00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:20.174
And lonely.

571
00:57:21.409 --> 00:57:23.844
He has your girl.

572
00:57:24.312 --> 00:57:27.848
And in return,
he will give us great miracles.

573
00:57:28.249 --> 00:57:32.420
Berrow's old families
will rise up and make you his.

574
00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:35.856
It's already started.
You don't see.

575
00:57:36.357 --> 00:57:37.725
She doesn't see you, Thomas.

576
00:57:39.694 --> 00:57:43.030
This is the first sign.
The gift of blood.

577
00:57:46.466 --> 00:57:47.902
And here is the second sign.

578
00:57:48.636 --> 00:57:51.672
The gift of souls tied
in hair, see?

579
00:57:52.673 --> 00:57:56.377
The third sign will be the gift
of fire burning in the fields.

580
00:57:56.510 --> 00:57:57.979
The fourth and the final sign
will be

581
00:57:58.112 --> 00:58:02.583
when the midnight sun will rise
over a great Black Barn.

582
00:58:03.384 --> 00:58:07.688
And you will see his glory.

583
00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:14.829
<i>Jesus Christ, Becca,</i>
<i>where are you?</i>

584
00:58:15.229 --> 00:58:16.897
<i>The police didn't catch</i>
<i>Derry Nash.</i>

585
00:58:17.031 --> 00:58:18.599
<i>They've lost him in the forest.</i>

586
00:58:18.733 --> 00:58:20.101
- Lost him?
<i>- Yes.</i>

587
00:58:20.234 --> 00:58:23.037
<i>Just come home, please.</i>

588
00:58:29.977 --> 00:58:31.746
I'm sorry you lost
the last person

589
00:58:31.879 --> 00:58:34.949
- who cared about you.
- Don't pity me.

590
00:58:36.017 --> 00:58:37.952
He took my Thomas
to the Black Barn,

591
00:58:38.085 --> 00:58:42.223
where he took your Grace, too.
You should be thankful.

592
00:59:48.722 --> 00:59:50.091
You need to run!

593
01:00:02.269 --> 01:00:04.371
I didn't take
your daughter.

594
01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:14.849
Stop looking for us.

595
01:00:14.982 --> 01:00:17.552
Do you hear me?
I didn't take your daughter.

596
01:00:17.785 --> 01:00:20.287
- You don't understand.
- Derry?

597
01:00:20.421 --> 01:00:23.924
Stop looking for us.
Stop fucking looking!

598
01:00:29.730 --> 01:00:30.965
Derry?

599
01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:34.335
Derry?

600
01:00:38.072 --> 01:00:38.939
Derry?

601
01:00:39.206 --> 01:00:40.975
What have you done
with my daughter?

602
01:00:44.411 --> 01:00:45.846
Forget about her!

603
01:00:46.947 --> 01:00:48.315
Where is she?

604
01:00:57.024 --> 01:01:00.361
Where is she?

605
01:01:35.496 --> 01:01:38.299
...police,
because I think if we can...

606
01:01:40.067 --> 01:01:42.002
film an interview ourselves,

607
01:01:42.671 --> 01:01:43.871
then we can be the ones

608
01:01:44.004 --> 01:01:45.239
who set up
the social media channel.

609
01:01:46.373 --> 01:01:49.544
And we'll get the message out.

610
01:02:14.301 --> 01:02:15.436
Stop.

611
01:03:24.438 --> 01:03:26.106
Bryony?

612
01:03:27.308 --> 01:03:28.275
Bryony?

613
01:03:30.110 --> 01:03:32.547
I just wanted to talk to you
about Grace.

614
01:03:33.615 --> 01:03:35.849
Do you remember the night
Grace disappeared?

615
01:03:36.383 --> 01:03:39.153
I asked you where she was,
and you said, "She's away now."

616
01:03:39.286 --> 01:03:40.321
Nope.

617
01:03:43.023 --> 01:03:44.958
Anything you can tell me
about it.

618
01:03:45.426 --> 01:03:46.493
Anything at all.

619
01:03:50.331 --> 01:03:52.132
I can tell you
to stick it up your arse.

620
01:03:53.802 --> 01:03:57.037
Up your arse. Up your arse.

621
01:03:57.171 --> 01:04:00.608
Up your arse! Up your arse!

622
01:04:00.874 --> 01:04:03.778
Up your arse! Up your arse!

623
01:04:03.977 --> 01:04:07.314
Up your arse! Up your arse!

624
01:04:07.448 --> 01:04:09.350
Up your arse!

625
01:04:11.085 --> 01:04:13.120
You know what happened to her,
don't you?

626
01:04:13.822 --> 01:04:14.756
No.

627
01:04:15.856 --> 01:04:17.525
- Do you know what this is?
- Nothing.

628
01:04:17.659 --> 01:04:20.127
We just made them
in Nature Club, that's all.

629
01:04:20.795 --> 01:04:22.029
No, wait!

630
01:04:22.963 --> 01:04:24.331
What's Nature Club?

631
01:04:26.266 --> 01:04:27.901
Tell me about Nature Club.

632
01:04:29.203 --> 01:04:31.171
It's just something we do
after school.

633
01:04:31.405 --> 01:04:34.007
- They teach us things.
- And that happens here?

634
01:04:34.475 --> 01:04:38.212
Yeah, but sometimes they take us
to the Secrets Room.

635
01:04:40.815 --> 01:04:44.853
- What's the Secrets Room?
- Here, I'll show you.

636
01:05:38.172 --> 01:05:39.373
Jocelyn.

637
01:05:40.608 --> 01:05:41.643
Mr. Abney.

638
01:05:41.776 --> 01:05:43.878
He's the one that teaches us
the songs,

639
01:05:44.311 --> 01:05:47.314
and other things about Berrow.

640
01:05:50.317 --> 01:05:51.586
What's this?

641
01:05:52.319 --> 01:05:54.488
That's when the gift is chosen.

642
01:05:56.290 --> 01:05:59.460
- What do you mean, "gift"?
- See?

643
01:06:00.795 --> 01:06:01.896
It's all right here.

644
01:06:02.496 --> 01:06:05.265
When Spirit Gallowgog
first spoke to Misrule,

645
01:06:05.432 --> 01:06:08.235
the people of Berrow took gifts
to his Black Barn.

646
01:06:08.402 --> 01:06:11.338
Apples, and pigs and chickens.

647
01:06:11.873 --> 01:06:14.943
Spirit Gallowgog promised
that if we bring him gifts,

648
01:06:15.309 --> 01:06:18.378
then he'd bless our harvest
and do great things.

649
01:06:19.379 --> 01:06:21.114
Then they saw there was one gift
they could give

650
01:06:21.248 --> 01:06:23.250
that was better
than all the rest.

651
01:06:24.552 --> 01:06:26.788
Grace was the greatest gift
of all.

652
01:06:27.387 --> 01:06:30.357
Spirit Gallowgog chose her
from all of us.

653
01:06:31.358 --> 01:06:34.762
He chose her 'cause he knew
she'd bring you to him.

654
01:06:38.465 --> 01:06:41.936
Bryony...
is Grace at the Black Barn?

655
01:06:42.604 --> 01:06:45.239
Yeah.
She's with Spirit Gallowgog.

656
01:06:45.372 --> 01:06:48.075
Until the celebration ends
tonight.

657
01:06:48.208 --> 01:06:51.513
Then the Black Barn goes.
She goes with it.

658
01:07:03.791 --> 01:07:06.995
Bry?
What's she doing down there?

659
01:07:07.294 --> 01:07:09.429
- Oh, George.
- Come on.

660
01:07:09.764 --> 01:07:11.098
You scared me.

661
01:07:16.004 --> 01:07:17.371
Come here.

662
01:07:17.972 --> 01:07:19.039
- You all right?
- Yeah.

663
01:07:19.172 --> 01:07:20.708
Yeah? Come here.

664
01:07:25.412 --> 01:07:28.215
What you doing with my Bryony?
Hm?

665
01:07:28.950 --> 01:07:30.317
The kids told me
you slapped her.

666
01:07:30.450 --> 01:07:31.686
Let me explain.

667
01:07:31.819 --> 01:07:33.186
Explain.

668
01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:35.055
You slapped her, did you?
Home, now!

669
01:07:35.222 --> 01:07:36.991
Slapping kids now are you,
Vicar Holland?

670
01:07:37.124 --> 01:07:40.127
- Let go. Just let me explain!
- Yeah? Explain what?

671
01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:41.796
- What, Mrs. Vicar? Tell me...
- We need to...

672
01:07:41.930 --> 01:07:44.431
We need to call the police!

673
01:07:45.432 --> 01:07:47.234
Police? What you talking
about, Vicar Holland?

674
01:07:47.367 --> 01:07:48.803
Why are we gonna call
the police?

675
01:07:48.937 --> 01:07:50.137
Because there are people

676
01:07:50.270 --> 01:07:51.739
poisoning the minds
of our children.

677
01:07:51.940 --> 01:07:53.908
Of our daughters.

678
01:07:54.042 --> 01:07:57.444
No, no, no. That's just keeping
a bit of local history alive.

679
01:07:57.579 --> 01:07:59.146
That's all it is, Vicar Holland.
That's it.

680
01:07:59.279 --> 01:08:02.016
- We're just keeping it alive.
- These are bad people, George.

681
01:08:02.149 --> 01:08:04.117
No, no, no, they're my people.

682
01:08:04.251 --> 01:08:06.020
They're my people,
they're all right.

683
01:08:06.654 --> 01:08:10.758
Listen, I'm going to see you
tonight, for Gracie.

684
01:08:11.158 --> 01:08:13.293
Yes. The vigil.

685
01:08:14.094 --> 01:08:17.331
Yeah? It's all right. Yeah.

686
01:08:18.198 --> 01:08:20.568
It's all right.

687
01:08:38.385 --> 01:08:39.721
Henry!

688
01:08:54.068 --> 01:08:55.402
Henry!

689
01:08:57.038 --> 01:08:58.740
Look. Look at this.

690
01:08:59.107 --> 01:09:02.076
This summer, Grace was going
to something called Nature Club.

691
01:09:02.275 --> 01:09:03.443
Yeah.

692
01:09:03.678 --> 01:09:06.014
It was supposed to be
a nice thing to do

693
01:09:06.146 --> 01:09:07.314
on a Wednesday afternoon

694
01:09:07.447 --> 01:09:08.482
when you were giving
the Eucharist.

695
01:09:08.616 --> 01:09:09.817
Well, the police came,

696
01:09:09.984 --> 01:09:11.451
and they tried
to take all evidence of it.

697
01:09:11.586 --> 01:09:13.121
All of her drawings
about the festival,

698
01:09:13.253 --> 01:09:14.656
- the Lord of Misrule...
- No, no, no, no.

699
01:09:14.789 --> 01:09:18.358
I'm not doing any of this
Jocelyn Abney bollocks.

700
01:09:18.492 --> 01:09:20.728
We have to do what the police
have told us to do.

701
01:09:20.862 --> 01:09:22.429
No, no,
because they're part of it.

702
01:09:22.563 --> 01:09:24.464
- Everybody's part of it.
- Part... Part of what?

703
01:09:24.599 --> 01:09:25.833
What does that mean?

704
01:09:25.967 --> 01:09:27.602
Maybe, this is just
a bunch of people

705
01:09:27.735 --> 01:09:29.704
who are trying to find
some meaning in their lives.

706
01:09:29.837 --> 01:09:34.075
No, no, no. It's more than that.
It's...

707
01:09:34.207 --> 01:09:36.176
They've found something
to believe in,

708
01:09:36.309 --> 01:09:37.712
and I know
how wonderful that can be,

709
01:09:37.845 --> 01:09:40.380
but I also know
how dangerous it can be.

710
01:09:40.515 --> 01:09:43.450
Listen to yourself.
You sound like an insane person.

711
01:09:43.885 --> 01:09:48.556
Yeah, well, this place is sick.
These people are sick.

712
01:09:48.956 --> 01:09:52.426
- And they're all in on it.
- Do you mean the people

713
01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:54.929
who planned a vigil
for our daughter?

714
01:09:55.763 --> 01:09:56.798
Henry...

715
01:09:58.166 --> 01:10:01.636
They know where Grace is.
Can't you see that?

716
01:10:02.036 --> 01:10:03.638
They call her a gift.

717
01:10:06.607 --> 01:10:08.275
You don't pray with me.

718
01:10:10.343 --> 01:10:13.715
No, no, I'm not going to start
fucking praying with you.

719
01:10:14.281 --> 01:10:15.883
Why would we do that?

720
01:10:16.450 --> 01:10:17.752
What do you think's
gonna happen?

721
01:10:18.086 --> 01:10:19.721
You think we're just gonna
kneel down, and then we just...

722
01:10:19.854 --> 01:10:21.856
We'll close our eyes,
and just wish and wish and wish.

723
01:10:21.989 --> 01:10:23.825
- Okay, okay, okay.
- And then she'll come

724
01:10:23.958 --> 01:10:25.626
strolling through
the front door,

725
01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:27.427
- then everything will be fine?
- Okay, okay, okay.

726
01:10:27.962 --> 01:10:30.865
Now, kindly fuck off
while I find our daughter.

727
01:10:32.867 --> 01:10:35.469
Don't you need your, um,
your evidence?

728
01:11:12.907 --> 01:11:14.274
One more night.

729
01:11:16.476 --> 01:11:18.546
Show me how to bring you home.

730
01:11:32.492 --> 01:11:34.028
The third sign.

731
01:11:34.896 --> 01:11:35.930
The gift.

732
01:11:37.098 --> 01:11:38.331
The fire.

733
01:11:51.579 --> 01:11:52.814
Yes, hello.

734
01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:56.284
I'm calling about my daughter's
missing person report.

735
01:11:56.416 --> 01:11:57.852
Grace Holland.

736
01:12:00.822 --> 01:12:03.490
Grace Holland, ten years old.

737
01:12:08.296 --> 01:12:09.630
Grace Holland.

738
01:12:12.733 --> 01:12:13.768
Closed?

739
01:12:15.236 --> 01:12:17.538
What does that mean?
What does that mean, "closed"?

740
01:12:17.672 --> 01:12:19.372
How is that possible?

741
01:12:23.376 --> 01:12:24.779
Hello, yes.

742
01:12:27.148 --> 01:12:29.283
DI Hythe, call me back
as soon as you get this.

743
01:12:29.416 --> 01:12:30.718
Call me back.

744
01:13:06.453 --> 01:13:08.022
Would you like to say anything?

745
01:14:12.987 --> 01:14:15.056
We're all very hopeful
for Grace.

746
01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:21.662
If you'd say a prayer,
I'd be very grateful.

747
01:14:29.036 --> 01:14:30.004
A prayer.

748
01:14:31.505 --> 01:14:32.673
Yes.

749
01:14:34.208 --> 01:14:35.242
It would be an honor.

750
01:15:16.450 --> 01:15:17.485
Where is she?

751
01:15:20.888 --> 01:15:22.857
What have you done
with my daughter?

752
01:15:23.357 --> 01:15:25.960
Spirit Gallowgog made a home
for your daughter

753
01:15:26.093 --> 01:15:27.328
when you didn't.

754
01:15:27.595 --> 01:15:30.231
He will do the same for you
if you give yourself to him.

755
01:15:37.371 --> 01:15:39.306
Ida... Ida, no...

756
01:16:04.565 --> 01:16:05.733
Stop it.

757
01:16:06.535 --> 01:16:07.902
What's going on?

758
01:16:11.005 --> 01:16:12.139
Shut up!

759
01:16:25.486 --> 01:16:27.188
I think you should leave now.

760
01:16:34.261 --> 01:16:36.764
Four days have passed.

761
01:16:37.798 --> 01:16:39.667
The feast ends tonight.

762
01:17:23.244 --> 01:17:26.280
This is madness.
This is fucking madness!

763
01:17:26.615 --> 01:17:27.848
That's exactly what it is.

764
01:17:28.315 --> 01:17:31.586
I mean, this... You were right.
You were right. I am so sorry.

765
01:17:31.719 --> 01:17:33.320
You were right
about all of this.

766
01:17:34.288 --> 01:17:36.457
I need to tell DI Hythe
about it.

767
01:17:36.591 --> 01:17:38.092
He can't help.

768
01:17:39.226 --> 01:17:40.728
We can't stay here.
We need to go.

769
01:17:40.861 --> 01:17:43.998
- We need to just...
- No, we can't leave.

770
01:17:48.537 --> 01:17:49.770
Henry.

771
01:17:51.138 --> 01:17:54.375
- What?
- Old families come visiting.

772
01:18:16.665 --> 01:18:19.033
Becca, come on!
Becca!

773
01:18:20.434 --> 01:18:22.703
Water. We need water.

774
01:18:29.476 --> 01:18:30.911
Hey. Hey.

775
01:18:31.045 --> 01:18:32.446
I told you to stop.

776
01:18:32.614 --> 01:18:35.916
Spirit Gallowgog took Thomas,
and he took your Grace.

777
01:18:36.050 --> 01:18:37.652
Derry, you were with Thomas
that day.

778
01:18:37.785 --> 01:18:39.220
I was too late.

779
01:18:39.353 --> 01:18:41.288
Four days had passed,
and the Black Barn had gone.

780
01:18:41.422 --> 01:18:42.856
- But you can save Grace.
- Derry.

781
01:18:42.990 --> 01:18:44.458
I need to go to back
to the Black Barn.

782
01:18:44.593 --> 01:18:46.460
- We need to get out of here.
- Derry...

783
01:18:46.595 --> 01:18:47.895
I need to go back there.

784
01:18:48.028 --> 01:18:50.532
There's only one way
to the Black Barn.

785
01:18:50.731 --> 01:18:52.733
You have to give yourself
to him.

786
01:18:53.934 --> 01:18:56.036
Henry!

787
01:19:22.597 --> 01:19:24.898
Oi! Over here. Come on!

788
01:20:03.304 --> 01:20:04.506
No!

789
01:20:54.522 --> 01:20:56.890
It's okay.

790
01:20:59.627 --> 01:21:01.028
Work's almost done.

791
01:21:02.162 --> 01:21:03.665
The crop has been sown.

792
01:21:04.198 --> 01:21:06.200
Now, we need to bring in
the harvest.

793
01:21:07.334 --> 01:21:09.903
To show you the truth
of his glory.

794
01:21:11.939 --> 01:21:13.974
You sing his praises, sister.

795
01:21:19.012 --> 01:21:21.014
He stands in the fields.

796
01:21:21.148 --> 01:21:24.385
He stands
in the fields and waits.

797
01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:27.988
Don't worry, sister.
You're amongst family now.

798
01:21:28.556 --> 01:21:31.225
And here we stand, my loves.

799
01:21:34.562 --> 01:21:36.964
For now is the time
to give Vicar Holland

800
01:21:37.097 --> 01:21:38.867
her warmth and succor.

801
01:21:39.734 --> 01:21:43.203
And yet she still will not sing
of his glory.

802
01:21:43.671 --> 01:21:44.806
She will not see his love.

803
01:21:44.938 --> 01:21:46.306
Then we must show her!

804
01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:49.143
Show her!
Show her!

805
01:21:49.476 --> 01:21:50.545
Yes.

806
01:21:50.911 --> 01:21:55.482
Your church came to this village
and they took Tobias Bron.

807
01:21:56.984 --> 01:21:58.620
They put him to his knees.

808
01:21:59.521 --> 01:22:03.290
And they crowned his head
in burning pitch.

809
01:22:04.491 --> 01:22:07.227
Purification, they called it.

810
01:22:09.731 --> 01:22:11.932
And then they built your church.

811
01:22:12.700 --> 01:22:17.572
To remind them of our place
under God.

812
01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:24.712
But Spirit Gallowgog took us
to his bosom and held us tight.

813
01:22:24.846 --> 01:22:25.979
Yes.

814
01:22:26.213 --> 01:22:28.917
Hard little seeds
deep beneath the earth.

815
01:22:29.717 --> 01:22:31.553
We remembered,
didn't we, my dears?

816
01:22:31.686 --> 01:22:34.988
- Yes.
- We remember the sign

817
01:22:35.489 --> 01:22:38.626
above Tobias Bron's head
when he died.

818
01:22:39.527 --> 01:22:40.961
A black sun...

819
01:22:42.029 --> 01:22:43.698
burned above his head.

820
01:22:44.364 --> 01:22:46.601
Brought down
by Spirit Gallowgog.

821
01:22:48.235 --> 01:22:50.270
You know what that means,
don't you?

822
01:22:52.439 --> 01:22:56.176
Light and darkness
switched places.

823
01:22:57.244 --> 01:23:00.648
Your fear and anger
became our love.

824
01:23:02.349 --> 01:23:04.017
That's right,
isn't it, my dears?

825
01:23:04.151 --> 01:23:07.020
- Yes.
- So...

826
01:23:08.857 --> 01:23:10.959
shall we go look
for the midnight sun again?

827
01:23:11.091 --> 01:23:12.326
Yes.

828
01:23:12.459 --> 01:23:14.228
Bring out the next blessing,
my dears.

829
01:23:35.683 --> 01:23:39.521
Oh. Oh, Henry.

830
01:23:45.459 --> 01:23:49.062
No, this... this isn't you.

831
01:23:49.764 --> 01:23:50.999
I know you.

832
01:23:51.465 --> 01:23:56.069
Callie Furleigh, we walked
our kids to school together.

833
01:23:57.839 --> 01:23:59.139
Bryony.

834
01:24:00.374 --> 01:24:03.912
And Dave Garfoot,
we... we drank your shitty beer

835
01:24:04.044 --> 01:24:06.213
and we laughed
at your shittier jokes,

836
01:24:06.346 --> 01:24:07.749
but it was okay
because every week

837
01:24:07.882 --> 01:24:12.119
you put a tenner
on the collection plate!

838
01:24:14.221 --> 01:24:17.391
And you...
you were supposed to help her.

839
01:24:17.525 --> 01:24:19.393
I am helping, Rebecca.

840
01:24:21.696 --> 01:24:24.364
Ida. Miri.

841
01:24:26.801 --> 01:24:28.670
We loved you.

842
01:24:29.303 --> 01:24:30.972
And we love you, too.

843
01:24:31.271 --> 01:24:36.010
No. No, this...
You are people of God,

844
01:24:36.176 --> 01:24:38.713
and you are capable
of great goodness!

845
01:24:39.212 --> 01:24:40.480
Yes.

846
01:24:40.615 --> 01:24:43.150
And all we want is to share it
with you.

847
01:24:45.352 --> 01:24:47.421
No, no, no.
No, I give myself!

848
01:24:47.555 --> 01:24:49.389
- I give myself!
- I don't believe you.

849
01:24:49.524 --> 01:24:51.659
- Rebecca.
- Henry.

850
01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:54.161
You don't need to be scared.
Listen to me.

851
01:24:54.662 --> 01:24:56.764
You don't have to be scared.
Do I look scared?

852
01:24:57.297 --> 01:24:59.968
- I'm not. Do you know why?
- Henry...

853
01:25:00.802 --> 01:25:03.705
Because I know that you're going
to get our little girl back.

854
01:25:12.947 --> 01:25:14.949
Okay, now, I need you to close
your eyes for me, love.

855
01:25:15.083 --> 01:25:17.484
Can you close your eyes for me,
all right? Close your eyes.

856
01:25:17.619 --> 01:25:18.886
No! No!

857
01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:20.387
I'm gonna do it quietly.

858
01:25:20.521 --> 01:25:21.889
- It's okay.
- No! I give myself!

859
01:25:22.023 --> 01:25:24.324
- I give myself! I give myself!
- Henry:

860
01:25:24.458 --> 01:25:30.163
No, stop.
Please! Please! Please!

861
01:25:30.297 --> 01:25:31.866
Stop.

862
01:25:32.066 --> 01:25:36.303
Stop this. No!

863
01:25:37.371 --> 01:25:40.708
Please! No, I give myself!
I give myself!

864
01:25:41.709 --> 01:25:46.514
- Henry!
- This is how we love.

865
01:25:49.784 --> 01:25:53.755
- No!
- Henry:

866
01:27:02.190 --> 01:27:03.624
Don't worry, sister.

867
01:27:05.126 --> 01:27:06.828
You're amongst us now.

868
01:27:08.196 --> 01:27:09.731
Amongst family.

869
01:28:19.167 --> 01:28:21.769
It's time. Don't be scared.

870
01:28:22.904 --> 01:28:24.806
He wouldn't want you
to be scared.

871
01:28:31.279 --> 01:28:32.580
I am scared.

872
01:28:33.881 --> 01:28:34.982
But I can see.

873
01:28:46.227 --> 01:28:47.962
Almost there, my loves.

874
01:30:42.243 --> 01:30:43.511
Grace?

875
01:31:01.762 --> 01:31:05.633
Gracie?

876
01:31:16.344 --> 01:31:19.180
You came. I knew you would.

877
01:31:29.790 --> 01:31:31.192
We have to go.

878
01:31:32.426 --> 01:31:33.694
No.

879
01:31:35.529 --> 01:31:36.864
He won't let us go.

880
01:31:45.773 --> 01:31:47.274
No, no.

881
01:31:55.216 --> 01:31:56.283
Grace!

882
01:31:56.817 --> 01:31:58.853
May God who has received you
by baptism

883
01:31:58.986 --> 01:32:00.654
pour upon the riches
of your grace.

884
01:32:02.957 --> 01:32:06.193
- No, you can't have her!
- Grace:

885
01:32:07.094 --> 01:32:10.831
We will be renewed daily
by the anointed Spirit.

886
01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:49.123
You dare break our pact
with Spirit Gallowgog?

887
01:34:49.790 --> 01:34:51.292
And take back his gift?

888
01:34:52.693 --> 01:34:53.827
Splice the sow.

889
01:34:54.563 --> 01:34:58.098
Split her from ear to ear,
so that she may meet her piglet.

890
01:34:58.866 --> 01:35:00.434
They won't touch me.

891
01:35:01.368 --> 01:35:02.403
Will you?

892
01:35:05.574 --> 01:35:08.876
Because I've done the one thing
that you were never able to do.

893
01:35:11.312 --> 01:35:15.115
I've been to the Black Barn.
I found my way to him.

894
01:35:15.382 --> 01:35:19.220
I stood before him,
and I let him look upon my face.

895
01:35:20.888 --> 01:35:22.890
I brought back my little girl.

896
01:35:24.825 --> 01:35:26.260
My blessing.

897
01:35:33.734 --> 01:35:35.369
Gallowgog called to you.

898
01:35:38.573 --> 01:35:41.809
He took your son.
He sent you signs

899
01:35:41.942 --> 01:35:44.078
and he invited you to face him,
but you didn't.

900
01:35:44.211 --> 01:35:46.180
I brought great wonders
to this village.

901
01:35:46.380 --> 01:35:49.250
You brought no wonders
to this village.

902
01:35:50.784 --> 01:35:52.419
You brought only fear.

903
01:35:55.956 --> 01:35:58.392
I gave my son to be his Misrule.

904
01:35:58.526 --> 01:36:00.695
I am his Misrule.

905
01:36:00.928 --> 01:36:03.264
And now I will show you
what I have become.

906
01:36:04.498 --> 01:36:07.434
I stand before the goat
in the fields.

907
01:36:08.902 --> 01:36:10.504
And he stands with me.

908
01:36:14.576 --> 01:36:17.811
And now I will end
this feast of fools.

909
01:36:18.747 --> 01:36:21.849
And how will it end, Mrs. Vicar?

910
01:36:23.585 --> 01:36:28.188
With you.

911
01:36:33.027 --> 01:36:38.165
Don't you dare. You traitors.
You will condemn this village.

912
01:36:38.533 --> 01:36:40.868
This is not the will
of the old families.

913
01:36:41.101 --> 01:36:43.638
You've carried
the black sun far enough.

914
01:36:43.937 --> 01:36:45.973
You can't carry it anymore.

915
01:36:56.618 --> 01:36:58.485
Then take this pain from me.

916
01:37:19.973 --> 01:37:22.076
This is how I love.

917
01:38:08.690 --> 01:38:10.357
All is as was.

918
01:39:03.511 --> 01:39:04.712
Let us pray.
