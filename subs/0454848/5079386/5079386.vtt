00:00:07.425 --> 00:00:10.428
<i>Hello everyone, this is Spike Lee</i>

2
00:00:10.511 --> 00:00:17.185
<i>and this is the director's commentary</i>
<i>for my film,</i> Inside Man.

3
00:00:17.268 --> 00:00:22.064
<i>It's a very special day today
because today is my 49th birthday.</i>

4
00:00:22.148 --> 00:00:25.985
<i>March 20th, 1957, I was born.</i>

5
00:00:26.068 --> 00:00:31.199
<i>And also tonight is going to be
the premiere, the big premiere for the film.</i>

6
00:00:31.282 --> 00:00:36.829
<i>So, I'm very glad to be sharing this with you
on this special day.</i>

7
00:00:37.121 --> 00:00:39.248
<i>Another good thing about today is that</i>

8
00:00:39.332 --> 00:00:44.670
<i>usually I have done director's commentaries
long after I have forgotten about the films.</i>

9
00:00:44.754 --> 00:00:47.924
<i>So, this film is still fresh in my mind.</i>

10
00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:51.969
...because I choose my words carefully
and I never repeat myself.

11
00:00:52.136 --> 00:00:55.264
I've told you my name. That's the "who."

12
00:00:56.682 --> 00:00:58.226
The "where" could most readily
be described...

13
00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.103
<i>The script was written by Russell Gewirtz</i>

14
00:01:01.187 --> 00:01:05.733
<i>and when I read this
I thought automatically that</i>

15
00:01:05.816 --> 00:01:11.572
<i>the character, Dalton Russell,
should say this facing the camera,</i>

16
00:01:11.656 --> 00:01:15.076
<i>address the camera, address the audience.</i>

17
00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:21.123
<i>Also for this shot was one of
my signature shots, double dolly shots.</i>

18
00:01:21.207 --> 00:01:26.629
<i>So, we start on dark, but as we keep moving</i>

19
00:01:26.754 --> 00:01:30.758
<i>you see the wall behind him.</i>

20
00:01:30.841 --> 00:01:37.181
<i>Clive is a great, great actor
and we get along great, have a lot of fun.</i>

21
00:01:37.765 --> 00:01:39.892
<i>It was a pleasure working with him.</i>

22
00:01:43.938 --> 00:01:50.027
<i>Now, that's the Cyclone, Coney Island,
the great borough of Brooklyn, New York.</i>

23
00:01:53.572 --> 00:01:56.284
<i>The song you're hearing,</i> Chaiyya Chaiyya,

24
00:01:56.367 --> 00:02:02.081
<i>is a song from a Bollywood musical,</i> Dil Se.

25
00:02:02.915 --> 00:02:07.461
<i>I'm a professor at the New York University
Graduate Film School</i>

26
00:02:07.545 --> 00:02:10.840
<i>and one class, we were talking
about musicals,</i>

27
00:02:10.923 --> 00:02:14.969
<i>and there's an Indian woman
who was a student of mine.</i>

28
00:02:15.052 --> 00:02:16.804
<i>She said,</i> "<i>Do you know anything</i>
<i>about Bollywood film?"</i>

29
00:02:16.887 --> 00:02:19.390
<i>And I said</i> "<i>No.</i> "<i>I said,</i> "<i>Suggest some.</i>"

30
00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.353
<i>So, next class she gave me</i>
<i>the DVD of this film</i> Dil Se.

31
00:02:24.437 --> 00:02:25.980
<i>I liked the film very much.</i>

32
00:02:26.063 --> 00:02:29.275
<i>I loved this song</i> Chaiyya Chaiyya.

33
00:02:29.358 --> 00:02:32.069
<i>And I made a mental note to myself that</i>

34
00:02:32.153 --> 00:02:37.366
<i>somehow I would try to put this song
in a movie.</i>

35
00:02:37.908 --> 00:02:41.078
<i>So we had the original song,
but Terence Blanchard,</i>

36
00:02:41.162 --> 00:02:43.497
<i>long-time collaborator, music composer,</i>

37
00:02:43.581 --> 00:02:46.834
<i>wrote an orchestral arrangement behind it.</i>

38
00:02:46.917 --> 00:02:51.964
<i>And for the end credits we have a rap
by MC Panjabi.</i>

39
00:02:57.678 --> 00:03:02.433
<i>That's Brooklyn Heights, right there.
The Promenade.</i>

40
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:06.937
<i>So this opening credit sequence
is not in the script.</i>

41
00:03:07.021 --> 00:03:10.816
<i>I figured that if we start with the van
at Coney Island</i>

42
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.989
<i>and you just see, one by one
as the bank robbers are gathered,</i>

43
00:03:17.281 --> 00:03:20.785
<i>on their way to the bank on Wall Street.</i>

44
00:03:33.005 --> 00:03:35.549
<i>My main man, Matthew Libatique,
cinematographer.</i>

45
00:03:35.633 --> 00:03:37.885
<i>Second time Matt and I worked together.</i>

46
00:03:38.636 --> 00:03:42.973
<i>Matty also shot for me</i> She Hate Me,
<i>my previous film.</i>

47
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.775
<i>The bull there on Wall Street. Brian Grazer.</i>

48
00:03:52.858 --> 00:03:58.114
<i>Many skeptics said that Brian and I would
not be able to coexist on a film together.</i>

49
00:03:58.197 --> 00:04:01.117
<i>But we proved them wrong.</i>

50
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.995
<i>We had a wonderful time working together.</i>

51
00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:11.168
<i>And looking forward to working together
in the near, near, near future.</i>

52
00:04:14.213 --> 00:04:18.551
<i>That also, the opening credits sequence
done by Big Films.</i>

53
00:04:18.634 --> 00:04:21.637
<i>Randy Balsmeyer, they've been doing
my opening, end credits</i>

54
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.683
<i>since</i> School Daze, <i>all the way back there.</i>

55
00:04:39.864 --> 00:04:43.617
<i>It's right here the bank robbers get out.</i>

56
00:04:46.412 --> 00:04:48.747
<i>And we intercut back and forth.</i>

57
00:04:48.831 --> 00:04:52.835
<i>What I told Matty that we never want to see
their faces.</i>

58
00:04:52.918 --> 00:04:55.671
<i>So keep the camera off their faces.</i>

59
00:04:55.754 --> 00:04:58.591
<i>Now, these people you see in the bank</i>

60
00:04:59.383 --> 00:05:02.386
<i>next minute or so,
they will become hostages.</i>

61
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.308
<i>They will become hostages within
this contained space in the bank.</i>

62
00:05:07.391 --> 00:05:10.311
<i>So, I felt it was a good opportunity
to have these hostages</i>

63
00:05:10.394 --> 00:05:16.650
<i>represent the diversity which is
the New York City that I know and love.</i>

64
00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.989
<i>People from all around the world come here
to New York City.</i>

65
00:05:22.072 --> 00:05:26.869
<i>And again we wanted these hostages
to reflect that.</i>

66
00:05:30.623 --> 00:05:33.542
Because it's been like
over a year now. Yeah.

67
00:05:36.795 --> 00:05:39.089
I want to snap this guy's neck,
I swear to God.

68
00:05:42.635 --> 00:05:44.261
So what?

69
00:05:46.263 --> 00:05:49.600
<i>This is a nice crane shot, right here.
Clive coming up the steps.</i>

70
00:05:50.351 --> 00:05:52.603
<i>We'll lean up the steps</i>

71
00:05:53.437 --> 00:05:56.982
<i>and we'll pull... Crane up all the way back</i>

72
00:05:57.066 --> 00:06:00.903
<i>to the top of the bank.</i>

73
00:06:00.986 --> 00:06:04.448
I got this guy in front of me
that thinks I don't see him looking at me.

74
00:06:04.532 --> 00:06:07.201
Fantastic. God damn it.

75
00:06:07.826 --> 00:06:09.328
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

76
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.747
Can you lower your voice
just a little bit, please?

77
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.792
<i>Right there, that's</i> "<i>Bear" Jackson</i>

78
00:06:14.875 --> 00:06:19.463
<i>who most of the time is my AD on my films,
but he's also a very fine actor.</i>

79
00:06:20.297 --> 00:06:22.591
<i>Also good third baseman. He's on our...</i>

80
00:06:22.675 --> 00:06:26.554
<i>Every film we have, we have a softball team.</i>

81
00:06:26.637 --> 00:06:28.138
<i>Last year, we played</i> The Sopranos.

82
00:06:28.222 --> 00:06:32.810
<i>We beat them 52-3 in a softball game.</i>

83
00:06:33.018 --> 00:06:37.064
<i>That's seven touchdowns.</i>

84
00:06:37.147 --> 00:06:42.611
<i>Seven touchdowns and a field goal versus</i>
<i>a field goalie, killed 'em.</i>

85
00:06:43.654 --> 00:06:46.407
<i>Edie Falco was the only one that showed up
from the cast.</i>

86
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.868
<i>Everybody else was just crew members.</i>

87
00:06:49.952 --> 00:06:52.871
<i>Well, we beat them like an African drum.</i>

88
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.209
Excuse me. Sir?

89
00:06:57.293 --> 00:06:58.711
Easy.

90
00:06:58.794 --> 00:07:02.756
Everybody get down
on the fucking floor! Now!

91
00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:06.051
<i>This bank is a key location.</i>

92
00:07:06.135 --> 00:07:10.055
<i>In fact, it is the last location that we found.</i>

93
00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:14.101
<i>It was built during 1920s.
It's right there in Wall Street,</i>

94
00:07:14.184 --> 00:07:17.605
<i>on a corner of Exchange and Hanover Place.</i>

95
00:07:17.688 --> 00:07:19.398
<i>And it was empty.</i>

96
00:07:19.481 --> 00:07:23.319
<i>So, it was perfect. It was like having a bank
on a back lot in Lower Manhattan.</i>

97
00:07:23.402 --> 00:07:29.074
<i>We were able to close the five streets
in all directions surrounding the bank.</i>

98
00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:36.373
<i>So, thank you, the Mayor's Office of Film
and Television, for making it possible.</i>

99
00:07:40.544 --> 00:07:43.339
Now, my friends and I are making

100
00:07:43.422 --> 00:07:46.342
a very large withdrawal from this bank.

101
00:07:46.425 --> 00:07:50.888
Anybody gets in our way
gets a bullet in the brain.

102
00:07:52.973 --> 00:07:55.434
Lie down, old man!
Put your fucking hands down!

103
00:07:55.559 --> 00:07:58.687
- Get your face on the floor.
- All right, I'm down! I'm down!

104
00:08:02.566 --> 00:08:05.819
Hey, Officer,
there's smoke coming out of there.

105
00:08:05.903 --> 00:08:07.863
<i>This is Victor Colicchio.</i>

106
00:08:07.946 --> 00:08:13.494
<i>Victor was one of the co-writers</i>
<i>on my film</i> Summer of Sam.

107
00:08:13.577 --> 00:08:18.165
<i>It was Victor, Mike Imperioli</i>
<i>and I who wrote</i> Summer of Sam.

108
00:08:18.248 --> 00:08:23.671
<i>In fact, Victor and Michael Imperioli of</i>
The Sopranos <i>fame brought that idea to me.</i>

109
00:08:23.754 --> 00:08:27.091
You fucking cops come near this door,
I start killing people.

110
00:08:27.758 --> 00:08:29.802
I not fucking kidding, man.

111
00:08:29.885 --> 00:08:32.262
<i>The accent, another one of the devices</i>

112
00:08:32.346 --> 00:08:35.599
<i>Clive's character uses to throw people off.</i>

113
00:08:35.974 --> 00:08:37.434
Central. Give me an 85.

114
00:08:37.518 --> 00:08:39.311
Back up, sir! Back up! You!

115
00:08:39.436 --> 00:08:40.688
- Shit!
- Back up! Back up!

116
00:08:40.771 --> 00:08:42.690
Stay around the corner!

117
00:08:42.773 --> 00:08:44.274
Central, give me an 85.

118
00:08:44.358 --> 00:08:45.442
Perp with a gun.

119
00:08:45.526 --> 00:08:50.322
<i>Now, we come to Denzel Washington's
introductory scene.</i>

120
00:08:50.698 --> 00:08:52.866
<i>There he is. D.</i>

121
00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:54.368
<i>Fourth time I worked with Denzel.</i>

122
00:08:54.451 --> 00:08:58.330
<i>The first time being</i> Mo' Better Blues,

123
00:08:58.872 --> 00:09:01.583
Malcolm X, <i>we all know he was robbed</i>
<i>an Oscar in that one,</i>

124
00:09:01.667 --> 00:09:04.962
He Got Game <i>and now</i> Inside Man.

125
00:09:05.129 --> 00:09:06.588
<i>When I took this script to Denzel,</i>

126
00:09:06.672 --> 00:09:13.303
<i>he was on Broadway playing Brutus</i>
<i>in a production</i> of Julius Caesar.

127
00:09:15.389 --> 00:09:17.766
<i>And when I send this script to Denzel</i>

128
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:21.186
<i>I gave him the option of choosing</i>

129
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:25.524
<i>the role of detective, which he chose,
or the bank robber.</i>

130
00:09:25.607 --> 00:09:28.402
<i>He says,</i> "<i>Spike, I wanna do it.</i>

131
00:09:28.485 --> 00:09:29.695
"<i>And I wanna play the detective</i>

132
00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:32.990
"<i>because the other guy has</i>
<i>his face covered the whole movie.</i>"

133
00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:38.746
<i>And it's true and that is the reason why</i>

134
00:09:38.829 --> 00:09:41.248
<i>Clive was hesitant to do this role at first,</i>

135
00:09:41.331 --> 00:09:44.918
<i>because his face would be
covered throughout.</i>

136
00:09:45.002 --> 00:09:48.630
<i>But we worked it out and eventually
it always comes down to trust.</i>

137
00:09:48.714 --> 00:09:51.884
<i>And I'm happy and grateful that Clive
put his trust in me</i>

138
00:09:51.967 --> 00:09:54.052
<i>that we look out for him
even though his face would be covered.</i>

139
00:09:54.136 --> 00:09:55.429
- ...feel about you?
- Oh, he's thrilled.

140
00:09:55.512 --> 00:09:57.139
To have a detective
sleeping in the next room,

141
00:09:57.222 --> 00:09:59.391
banging his sister.
Then she tries to bring it all back on me.

142
00:09:59.475 --> 00:10:01.101
You know, "If we had a bigger place,
we wouldn't have this problem."

143
00:10:01.185 --> 00:10:02.770
Of course, if we got married...

144
00:10:02.853 --> 00:10:05.773
<i>Now, Denzel's partner in there is
Chiwetel Ejiofor.</i>

145
00:10:05.856 --> 00:10:10.778
<i>I first saw Chiwetel's work in a great film</i>
Dirty Pretty Things.

146
00:10:10.861 --> 00:10:13.322
<i>He also has a small role</i>
<i>in</i> She Hate Me, <i>also.</i>

147
00:10:13.489 --> 00:10:15.532
Yeah, but she won't call me back.

148
00:10:15.616 --> 00:10:17.618
- You guys cops?
- Oh, shit!

149
00:10:17.701 --> 00:10:20.120
<i>Denzel's character's name is Keith Frazier,</i>

150
00:10:20.204 --> 00:10:23.457
<i>named after New York Knick great
Walt Frazier.</i>

151
00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:26.668
<i>And I wanted Mitchell's name to be Monroe,</i>

152
00:10:26.752 --> 00:10:29.421
<i>as in Wolfrage Earl Monroe.</i>

153
00:10:29.505 --> 00:10:33.050
<i>But Denzel squashed it. He says,</i>
"<i>Spike, this film is not about the Knicks.</i>"

154
00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:35.636
<i>So, that's why Chiwe's name
was not Monroe.</i>

155
00:10:35.719 --> 00:10:37.471
Oh, good. Good.

156
00:10:37.554 --> 00:10:39.890
I'm giving you a break, here.
Don't make me look like a fool.

157
00:10:39.973 --> 00:10:42.226
- This is it, baby. The show!
- Yeah.

158
00:10:42.351 --> 00:10:44.186
You got the call, man. God damn!

159
00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:48.732
<i>Now, the hat.
That's something Denzel definitely wanted.</i>

160
00:10:48.982 --> 00:10:50.567
Head bad guy puts a gun to your head
and makes you...

161
00:10:50.651 --> 00:10:54.196
<i>Play with the hat, look at that.
Fix the brim. I see you, D.</i>

162
00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:56.240
<i>Fix the brim.</i>

163
00:10:58.242 --> 00:11:01.203
<i>There's a New York City detective,</i>

164
00:11:01.286 --> 00:11:05.707
<i>Detective Neil Carter,
who was a consultant on this film.</i>

165
00:11:05.791 --> 00:11:09.253
<i>A lot of stuff Denzel got was from him.</i>

166
00:11:09.336 --> 00:11:11.755
<i>Detective Neil Carter just recently retired</i>

167
00:11:11.839 --> 00:11:15.133
<i>as a New York City detective
for over 20 years.</i>

168
00:11:15.384 --> 00:11:17.135
<i>He's sharp.</i>

169
00:11:22.432 --> 00:11:24.643
<i>I love that shot you just saw before.</i>

170
00:11:24.726 --> 00:11:26.895
<i>Put the camera on top of the roof.</i>

171
00:11:26.979 --> 00:11:28.355
<i>Now, this is very hard scene to shoot,</i>

172
00:11:28.438 --> 00:11:35.028
<i>just the logistics of all these vehicles
and trucks, everybody arriving.</i>

173
00:11:37.197 --> 00:11:38.532
<i>In New York, see those guys, right there?</i>

174
00:11:38.615 --> 00:11:41.535
<i>In New York City they don't call it SWAT.</i>

175
00:11:41.618 --> 00:11:45.414
<i>It's E.S.U., Emergency Service Unit.</i>

176
00:11:49.334 --> 00:11:50.460
Sarge, what do you got?

177
00:11:50.544 --> 00:11:52.504
I got a perp in the bank.
Possible hostage situation.

178
00:11:52.588 --> 00:11:55.757
<i>That guy right there, with the microphone,</i>

179
00:11:55.841 --> 00:11:58.343
<i>he's a real E.S.U. guy. His name is...</i>

180
00:11:58.427 --> 00:12:01.805
<i>He retired, also, Ed Bogdanowicz.</i>

181
00:12:01.889 --> 00:12:04.808
<i>He was also a consultant.</i>

182
00:12:13.442 --> 00:12:16.028
<i>This theme you hear here is
the E.S.U. theme.</i>

183
00:12:16.111 --> 00:12:19.156
<i>There goes that shot I like again
from the roof.</i>

184
00:12:19.406 --> 00:12:22.159
<i>Stuck a crane out from the top of the roof.</i>

185
00:12:22.784 --> 00:12:24.953
- Collins? What you got?
- Hernandez.

186
00:12:25.037 --> 00:12:27.998
I got a perp inside with a gun.
He claims he's got some hostages in there.

187
00:12:30.417 --> 00:12:33.003
Everyone, heads up! Let's clear the way!

188
00:12:52.856 --> 00:12:55.275
Let's go. Set them up. All right.

189
00:12:55.359 --> 00:12:57.444
We've got it under control.

190
00:12:57.861 --> 00:12:59.571
Step back, please!

191
00:13:00.155 --> 00:13:02.282
- Step back!
- Get back! Thank you.

192
00:13:02.366 --> 00:13:06.161
<i>Now, we get introduced to Arthur Case.</i>

193
00:13:06.244 --> 00:13:11.458
<i>Arthur Case played by the great, great,
great Christopher Plummer.</i>

194
00:13:12.167 --> 00:13:13.585
<i>I like this shot, too.</i>

195
00:13:13.669 --> 00:13:16.672
<i>Steadicam shot, we tilt down
from the ceiling.</i>

196
00:13:17.881 --> 00:13:20.008
<i>And that's Christopher Plummer, right there.</i>

197
00:13:20.092 --> 00:13:23.261
<i>Christopher Plummer was also in</i> Malcolm X.

198
00:13:23.345 --> 00:13:25.222
<i>He had that great scene with Denzel</i>

199
00:13:26.223 --> 00:13:29.643
<i>where they talked about
the origins of Jesus Christ.</i>

200
00:13:29.726 --> 00:13:32.604
- Has anybody been hurt?
- I don't think so, but there are hostages.

201
00:13:34.189 --> 00:13:36.400
Oh, how awful.

202
00:13:37.234 --> 00:13:39.569
- Which branch is it?
- Number 32. 20 Exchange Place.

203
00:13:40.737 --> 00:13:41.989
Which one?

204
00:13:42.072 --> 00:13:44.491
<i>You might have recently seen</i>

205
00:13:44.574 --> 00:13:47.953
<i>Christopher Plummer also
in two very fine films,</i>

206
00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:52.916
Syriana <i>and</i> The New World
<i>directed by Terrence Malick.</i>

207
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.004
<i>So, Christopher is still doing his thing.</i>

208
00:13:57.087 --> 00:14:02.300
<i>And I hope to be doing the same thing,
that high quality, when I reach that age, too.</i>

209
00:14:05.679 --> 00:14:08.181
Get these people out of here.
Come on, open these gates. Back up.

210
00:14:08.265 --> 00:14:10.267
Up on the sidewalk. Come on in.

211
00:14:12.269 --> 00:14:16.815
<i>Now, the music you hear,
this is Denzel's theme.</i>

212
00:14:16.898 --> 00:14:20.527
<i>We call it</i> "<i>Big Willie and the twins.</i>"

213
00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:25.032
<i>Big Willie and the twins being
a penis and two testicles.</i>

214
00:14:26.116 --> 00:14:28.535
<i>Big Willie and the twins.</i>

215
00:14:28.618 --> 00:14:30.287
<i>I think you people
knew that already, though.</i>

216
00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.039
...in some foreign accent
about killing hostages.

217
00:14:32.122 --> 00:14:34.541
- See any other gunmen?
- No, sir. I couldn't see anything at all.

218
00:14:34.624 --> 00:14:35.917
- You hear anything inside?
- No, sir,

219
00:14:36.001 --> 00:14:40.088
but with that .357 sticking in my face,
I can't really be sure. I'm sorry.

220
00:14:41.048 --> 00:14:42.049
Okay.

221
00:14:43.675 --> 00:14:47.054
Good, good. Good, good, good, good.
You did a good job, Sergeant.

222
00:14:47.137 --> 00:14:49.222
You ever had a gun
stuck in your face before?

223
00:14:49.306 --> 00:14:51.558
<i>Denzel's working that hat.</i>

224
00:14:51.641 --> 00:14:53.643
<i>As we call them,</i> "<i>Brimskys.</i>"

225
00:14:53.727 --> 00:14:57.147
<i>You got the front brim broke down.</i>

226
00:14:57.355 --> 00:14:58.398
All right, well, look.

227
00:14:58.482 --> 00:15:00.776
As soon as we get this thing cleared up,
we'll cut you loose, all right?

228
00:15:00.859 --> 00:15:02.402
If you don't mind,
I'd rather hang around a while,

229
00:15:02.486 --> 00:15:04.613
at least until we make contact.

230
00:15:04.696 --> 00:15:06.156
That's what I like to hear, Sergeant.

231
00:15:11.953 --> 00:15:15.332
<i>Now, this is not the bank location per se.</i>

232
00:15:15.499 --> 00:15:17.501
<i>This is a set.</i>

233
00:15:17.584 --> 00:15:20.295
<i>This set was built in Brooklyn.</i>

234
00:15:20.378 --> 00:15:23.965
<i>The Steiner Studios
was in a Brooklyn Navy yard.</i>

235
00:15:24.466 --> 00:15:27.594
<i>The production designer on this film
was the great Wynn Thomas.</i>

236
00:15:27.677 --> 00:15:31.223
<i>Wynn Thomas was the production designer
of my very first film,</i>

237
00:15:31.306 --> 00:15:32.265
She's Gotta Have It.

238
00:15:32.349 --> 00:15:35.602
<i>Did</i> She's Gotta Have It, School Daze,
Do the Right Thing, Malcolm X.

239
00:15:35.727 --> 00:15:36.770
<i>Gone on to do many more films,</i>

240
00:15:36.853 --> 00:15:41.149
<i>but it'd been a while since Wynn and I
had worked together.</i>

241
00:15:41.233 --> 00:15:44.694
Bank employees, this side!
Everyone else, over there!

242
00:15:48.115 --> 00:15:50.242
<i>So all this is Steadicam work.</i>

243
00:15:50.325 --> 00:15:52.619
<i>Great operator's name is Steve Consentino.</i>

244
00:15:52.702 --> 00:15:55.497
...I need everybody
to take your cell phones and your keys

245
00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:59.334
out of your pockets and handbags
and hold them in the air.

246
00:16:20.105 --> 00:16:21.898
- What's your name?
- Peter.

247
00:16:21.982 --> 00:16:24.192
- Peter what?
- Peter Hammond.

248
00:16:24.276 --> 00:16:25.360
Where's your cell phone...

249
00:16:25.443 --> 00:16:29.865
<i>This is where Dalton has to establish
to the hostages that he means business.</i>

250
00:16:29.948 --> 00:16:32.576
Peter, think very carefully
about how you answer...

251
00:16:32.659 --> 00:16:36.329
<i>People have to be terrified.
They are not called terrorists for nothing.</i>

252
00:16:36.413 --> 00:16:37.581
...your headstone will read,

253
00:16:37.664 --> 00:16:40.792
"Here lies Peter Hammond, hero,

254
00:16:40.876 --> 00:16:42.961
"who valiantly attempted
to prevent a brilliant bank robbery...

255
00:16:43.044 --> 00:16:46.923
<i>People have to know that if they mess up
then you get a bullet in the brain.</i>

256
00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:50.468
"...wound up getting shot
in the fucking head."

257
00:16:51.678 --> 00:16:54.723
Now, Peter Hammond,

258
00:16:55.682 --> 00:16:56.850
where is your cell phone?

259
00:16:56.933 --> 00:16:59.728
I'm telling you, I did. I left it at home.

260
00:17:07.277 --> 00:17:10.864
<i>Now, we are gonna go to a Steadicam shot
where we pan</i>

261
00:17:10.947 --> 00:17:13.867
<i>all of, right here, all the hostages</i>

262
00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:20.373
<i>and we end up on the phone,</i>

263
00:17:20.457 --> 00:17:23.960
<i>where there's a big laugh coming up.</i>

264
00:17:25.712 --> 00:17:27.964
<i>When he gets the phone,
you're going to hear the ring tone,</i>

265
00:17:28.048 --> 00:17:30.425
<i>one of my favorite songs this year.</i>

266
00:17:31.676 --> 00:17:32.802
Gold Digger.

267
00:17:34.471 --> 00:17:35.472
<i>Right here.</i>

268
00:17:46.816 --> 00:17:48.652
<i>Kanye West.</i>

269
00:17:50.612 --> 00:17:52.572
<i>...mess with no broke niggaz</i>

270
00:17:52.656 --> 00:17:54.449
<i>Kanye West, Jamie Foxx.</i>

271
00:17:54.532 --> 00:17:57.577
Okay, I fucked up. I'm sorry. Please.

272
00:17:57.661 --> 00:18:00.288
Hey. Don't worry about it.

273
00:18:01.164 --> 00:18:02.874
<i>This is where Clive has a little fun here</i>

274
00:18:02.999 --> 00:18:08.672
<i>when he goes through a little pantomime
behind frosted glass</i>

275
00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:12.842
<i>whether he should kick this guy's ass.</i>

276
00:18:15.262 --> 00:18:18.390
<i>Yeah, he's made his mind up.</i>

277
00:18:18.473 --> 00:18:20.058
<i>Here comes an ass whooping.</i>

278
00:18:20.141 --> 00:18:22.602
Just let me talk to you!
Please, please, listen to me.

279
00:18:22.686 --> 00:18:24.479
Let me explain.

280
00:18:26.481 --> 00:18:28.191
Help! Help me.

281
00:18:28.275 --> 00:18:29.401
Stop!

282
00:18:29.484 --> 00:18:30.694
Stop!

283
00:18:34.489 --> 00:18:38.410
<i>Now he's getting stomped, Brooklyn style.</i>

284
00:18:46.209 --> 00:18:48.753
<i>That reminds me</i> of The Wizard of Oz.
<i>Remember when</i>

285
00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:52.799
<i>the house fell on the wicked witch</i>

286
00:18:52.882 --> 00:18:55.302
<i>and you just saw the legs sticking out?</i>

287
00:18:55.385 --> 00:18:56.928
<i>That's what we wanted right there.</i>

288
00:18:59.723 --> 00:19:01.683
- And you are?
- Vikram Walia.

289
00:19:01.766 --> 00:19:02.892
Vikram Walia.

290
00:19:02.976 --> 00:19:04.811
<i>That's my man Waris.</i>

291
00:19:04.894 --> 00:19:06.229
Hey, mister.

292
00:19:11.401 --> 00:19:12.861
Keep it.

293
00:19:12.944 --> 00:19:15.530
Men here. Women here.

294
00:19:16.573 --> 00:19:18.033
Move!

295
00:19:23.788 --> 00:19:27.000
I need all of you
to strip down to your underwear.

296
00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.378
Now.

297
00:19:32.797 --> 00:19:34.924
<i>So the extras...</i>

298
00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:37.052
<i>All these people knew this scene
was coming up,</i>

299
00:19:37.135 --> 00:19:39.846
<i>so people were working out.</i>

300
00:19:39.929 --> 00:19:42.682
<i>Because people want to look
somewhat correct</i>

301
00:19:42.766 --> 00:19:44.809
<i>once they had to disrobe.</i>

302
00:19:44.893 --> 00:19:49.522
<i>People are...
They're tucking them tummies in, too!</i>

303
00:19:50.774 --> 00:19:52.650
<i>Now, Marcia, right here,</i>

304
00:19:52.734 --> 00:19:56.321
<i>she's one of the hostages</i>
<i>in</i> Dog Day Afternoon.

305
00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:01.534
<i>There are numerous homages to
Sidney Lumet's landmark film,</i>

306
00:20:01.618 --> 00:20:04.621
Dog Day Afternoon, <i>starring AI Pacino</i>
<i>and John Cazale.</i>

307
00:20:05.288 --> 00:20:07.290
<i>This is one of them.</i>

308
00:20:08.583 --> 00:20:10.460
What's with you <i>mishegoyim?</i>

309
00:20:10.543 --> 00:20:12.879
Go ahead. Make my day.

310
00:20:12.962 --> 00:20:15.715
- Take your fucking clothes off, lady.
- No!

311
00:20:17.384 --> 00:20:19.177
Stevie?

312
00:20:22.097 --> 00:20:24.015
Let's go!

313
00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.143
Now, I need all of you

314
00:20:27.268 --> 00:20:30.688
to put on one of these suits
and these masks.

315
00:20:36.194 --> 00:20:38.446
<i>So, there's one other actor</i>

316
00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:41.449
<i>who's also in</i> Dog Day Afternoon, <i>too.</i>

317
00:20:41.533 --> 00:20:45.787
<i>In fact, we went through the whole...
We know we weren't getting Pacino.</i>

318
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:49.874
<i>But, besides Pacino, we got
the only two people that are still alive</i>

319
00:20:49.958 --> 00:20:54.212
<i>or we could find from that film,</i>
Dog Afternoon.

320
00:20:54.337 --> 00:20:56.047
<i>Willem Dafoe.</i>

321
00:20:56.131 --> 00:21:00.468
<i>I have seen Willem Dafoe in around
New York City a million times.</i>

322
00:21:00.552 --> 00:21:05.098
<i>And Willem Dafoe, we're at
the opening night</i>

323
00:21:05.181 --> 00:21:08.184
<i>of Denzel's play,</i> Julius Caesar.

324
00:21:08.268 --> 00:21:11.771
<i>And in the intermission, I found myself...</i>

325
00:21:11.855 --> 00:21:16.234
<i>Willem and I were side by side
in the men's bathroom.</i>

326
00:21:16.317 --> 00:21:18.486
<i>I mean, the urinals were side by side.</i>

327
00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:22.282
<i>And, so, while both of us were urinating, I</i>
<i>said,</i> "<i>You know, we should work together.</i>"

328
00:21:22.907 --> 00:21:25.994
<i>He said,</i> "<i>Yeah, Spike. We should.</i>"

329
00:21:26.077 --> 00:21:29.789
<i>We both zipped our pants and walked out.</i>

330
00:21:29.873 --> 00:21:34.878
<i>And then soon after that
I sent him the script.</i>

331
00:21:35.378 --> 00:21:37.839
That's the way it's gonna be.
You got vests for us?

332
00:21:38.006 --> 00:21:41.968
<i>And he was in the movie.</i>

333
00:21:42.051 --> 00:21:43.303
- ...check them into the command log.
- Okay.

334
00:21:43.386 --> 00:21:44.762
You know what?
I'm gonna get out of your hair

335
00:21:44.846 --> 00:21:46.806
and let you get control
of this crime scene, okay?

336
00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:48.892
You'll let me know when you're ready
with a detailed briefing?

337
00:21:48.975 --> 00:21:52.520
- Okay.
- We're gonna take a walk down to the diner.

338
00:21:52.604 --> 00:21:55.315
Don't go in the bank without calling us first,
all right? Okay?

339
00:21:55.398 --> 00:21:57.317
- All right.
- Good to see you, Captain.

340
00:22:06.242 --> 00:22:08.495
Shouldn't we be in there?

341
00:22:08.745 --> 00:22:11.456
Let's give him some time. See what he does.
Come on.

342
00:22:12.874 --> 00:22:15.043
Until he secures his position
and gets the physical layout,

343
00:22:15.126 --> 00:22:16.544
he'll only dump on us.

344
00:22:16.628 --> 00:22:18.505
If the show starts, he'll call us.
Trust me. I've seen him work.

345
00:22:18.588 --> 00:22:19.672
<i>See, another variation of</i>

346
00:22:19.756 --> 00:22:23.426
<i>the</i> "<i>Big Willie and the twins" theme</i>
<i>right here.</i>

347
00:22:23.635 --> 00:22:28.056
<i>As I said before,
which is Denzel's character's theme.</i>

348
00:22:28.139 --> 00:22:29.307
...to them it's a tactical situation.

349
00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:32.936
Us being here means there's
a mental side to it that they don't get.

350
00:22:33.561 --> 00:22:35.438
- Told you, you could handle this.
- Yeah.

351
00:22:36.105 --> 00:22:39.150
I keep waiting for someone higher up
on the food chain to show up and say,

352
00:22:39.234 --> 00:22:40.401
"Here's what we do."

353
00:22:40.485 --> 00:22:41.694
What happened at the hospital?

354
00:22:41.778 --> 00:22:44.405
Guy shot himself, shot his girlfriend.
Thank you.

355
00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:57.043
I told you, I've got

356
00:22:57.210 --> 00:22:58.211
a heart condition.

357
00:22:58.294 --> 00:23:00.630
<i>That's Gerry Vichi.</i>

358
00:23:01.172 --> 00:23:05.468
<i>You know, even though you have the stars
like Denzel, Clive,</i>

359
00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:09.138
<i>Jodie Foster, Christopher Plummer,</i>

360
00:23:09.222 --> 00:23:13.726
<i>Willem Dafoe, Chiwetel,</i>

361
00:23:13.935 --> 00:23:17.772
<i>you still gotta have a good supporting cast.</i>

362
00:23:18.314 --> 00:23:24.070
<i>And I think we got great performances
from everybody,</i>

363
00:23:24.153 --> 00:23:25.863
<i>especially like this guy Gerry Vichi.</i>

364
00:23:25.989 --> 00:23:28.741
<i>So, you gotta have
the supporting roles, too.</i>

365
00:23:28.825 --> 00:23:31.035
<i>People who are in the supporting roles
got to come through also.</i>

366
00:23:31.119 --> 00:23:32.620
- Don't move! Don't move!
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

367
00:23:32.704 --> 00:23:35.164
- Don't move! Don't move! Come here!
- I haven't got...

368
00:23:36.374 --> 00:23:38.167
- Come here, come here, come here!
- I work in the bank!

369
00:23:38.251 --> 00:23:39.961
On your knees! Down on your knees now!

370
00:23:40.044 --> 00:23:41.754
- They sent me out here!
- Now!

371
00:23:41.838 --> 00:23:43.715
- They sent me out here!
- Now!

372
00:23:43.798 --> 00:23:45.425
- He said stay away!
- Cuff him.

373
00:23:45.508 --> 00:23:48.136
If you come near the bank,
he'll throw out two dead bodies!

374
00:23:48.219 --> 00:23:50.013
- Who said this? Who?
- I don't know who!

375
00:23:50.138 --> 00:23:51.556
The guy with the big fucking gun!

376
00:23:51.639 --> 00:23:53.182
- That's who!
- All right, get on your feet. Let's go.

377
00:23:53.266 --> 00:23:54.475
- There's four of them in there!
- Come on.

378
00:23:54.559 --> 00:23:55.685
Christ!

379
00:23:55.768 --> 00:23:56.811
- Calm down!
- Let's go!

380
00:23:56.894 --> 00:23:59.355
- Am I gonna be on TV?
- Yeah. A big star. Let's go. Come on.

381
00:23:59.439 --> 00:24:02.650
<i>Is he gonna be on TV?</i>

382
00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:05.778
Was it a time when I thought
I might not see my family again?

383
00:24:05.862 --> 00:24:07.739
<i>Again, that's</i> "<i>Bear" Jackson,</i>

384
00:24:07.822 --> 00:24:12.702
<i>who, when he's not in front of the camera,
is part of the Assistant Director staff.</i>

385
00:24:15.163 --> 00:24:18.791
<i>He's on our softball team, third baseman,</i>

386
00:24:18.875 --> 00:24:21.753
<i>power, throw.</i>

387
00:24:21.836 --> 00:24:24.547
<i>His knees are messed up, so he doesn't
have the range at third or he can't run,</i>

388
00:24:24.631 --> 00:24:29.344
<i>but he can usually bat on third or fourth.</i>

389
00:24:29.427 --> 00:24:31.095
<i>Good actor, too.</i>

390
00:24:31.179 --> 00:24:33.931
<i>Now, these interrogation scenes</i>

391
00:24:34.015 --> 00:24:37.518
<i>that are throughout the body of the film,
that was scripted.</i>

392
00:24:37.602 --> 00:24:40.146
<i>Matty Libatique and I, the cinematographer,</i>

393
00:24:40.229 --> 00:24:46.653
<i>decided that we should give those scenes
a different look than the rest of the film.</i>

394
00:24:46.736 --> 00:24:50.823
<i>And so, once we shot that stuff and we
were editing those at the end of the film,</i>

395
00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:57.497
<i>we really had to play with where and what
interrogation scenes we would use.</i>

396
00:24:58.581 --> 00:25:01.834
<i>So, there was a lot of shuffling
before we came</i>

397
00:25:01.918 --> 00:25:05.838
<i>to the final spots where they would appear.</i>

398
00:25:21.854 --> 00:25:25.608
<i>I like this push in to Clive's face.</i>

399
00:25:25.692 --> 00:25:28.069
<i>Again, a Steadicam shot.</i>

400
00:25:30.822 --> 00:25:31.989
Beautiful.

401
00:25:34.033 --> 00:25:35.368
<i>Crane shot.</i>

402
00:25:35.451 --> 00:25:39.122
<i>Now, if you want to buy this lot,
it's probably still open. $10 million.</i>

403
00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:40.707
<i>You can have it.</i>

404
00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:43.251
<i>It's all yours, $10 million.</i>

405
00:25:43.334 --> 00:25:45.211
<i>Empty, raw space.</i>

406
00:25:45.294 --> 00:25:48.631
<i>Now, an introduction to Jodie Foster.</i>

407
00:25:49.132 --> 00:25:50.550
<i>When Jodie said she wanted to do the film,</i>

408
00:25:50.633 --> 00:25:52.385
<i>she said she loved the character
but she also said,</i>

409
00:25:52.468 --> 00:25:55.054
"<i>Spike, I want to look glamorous</i>
<i>in this movie.</i>

410
00:25:55.138 --> 00:25:58.224
"<i>I'm tired of playing these</i>
<i>run-down mothers and whatnot.</i>

411
00:25:58.307 --> 00:26:00.226
"<i>I want to look glamorous,</i>
<i>want to have the hair,</i>

412
00:26:00.309 --> 00:26:03.312
"<i>the makeup, the nails,</i>

413
00:26:03.396 --> 00:26:05.982
"<i>the lipstick, the jewelry,</i>

414
00:26:06.065 --> 00:26:09.068
"<i>the Chanel business suits,</i>

415
00:26:09.152 --> 00:26:12.363
"<i>Manolo Blahniks,</i>
<i>whatever you call them, shoes.</i>"

416
00:26:12.447 --> 00:26:13.698
We'll need to end this here.

417
00:26:13.781 --> 00:26:15.533
I'm gonna need
a copy of your purchase agreement,

418
00:26:15.658 --> 00:26:18.369
your mortgage application,
and the other documentation...

419
00:26:18.453 --> 00:26:19.871
<i>Check out Jodie's legs.</i>

420
00:26:19.954 --> 00:26:22.999
<i>I said,</i> "<i>Jodie, you should</i>
<i>show your legs more often.</i>

421
00:26:23.166 --> 00:26:27.336
"<i>You've got some hell of fine legs.</i>"
<i>Was kidding around the set. Look at that.</i>

422
00:26:31.966 --> 00:26:37.513
<i>Jodie Foster and my brother David Lee
attended Yale together,</i>

423
00:26:39.015 --> 00:26:42.310
<i>Calhoun College, Yale University,</i>

424
00:26:42.393 --> 00:26:45.772
<i>and they have remained good friends
over the years.</i>

425
00:26:45.855 --> 00:26:48.608
<i>And Jo and I have been
wanting to work together</i>

426
00:26:48.691 --> 00:26:54.697
<i>but just couldn't find something
till this movie.</i>

427
00:26:55.698 --> 00:26:57.241
<i>But that's the way it usually works,
you know.</i>

428
00:26:57.325 --> 00:26:58.951
<i>When it's gonna happen it's gonna happen.</i>

429
00:26:59.035 --> 00:27:01.871
<i>You have to just be patient,
should not try to force stuff.</i>

430
00:27:01.954 --> 00:27:04.290
<i>You know, they're great actors but</i>

431
00:27:04.373 --> 00:27:08.294
<i>number one, they're busy, they might not
have the time in their schedule.</i>

432
00:27:08.377 --> 00:27:12.423
<i>Number two, they might not be right
for the part.</i>

433
00:27:12.548 --> 00:27:14.175
<i>Everything is timing.</i>

434
00:27:14.258 --> 00:27:16.135
...complete discretion.

435
00:27:16.219 --> 00:27:18.888
Are you such a person
or have I been misinformed?

436
00:27:19.972 --> 00:27:20.973
Go on.

437
00:27:21.974 --> 00:27:24.769
Can I pick you up in front of
your office building in five minutes?

438
00:27:24.894 --> 00:27:27.355
- I'll be downstairs.
- Thank you.

439
00:27:32.902 --> 00:27:36.280
They had a kind of genius plan...

440
00:27:36.364 --> 00:27:38.658
<i>Again,</i>

441
00:27:40.076 --> 00:27:42.411
<i>this is adlib right here.</i>

442
00:27:42.995 --> 00:27:44.664
<i>So was Bear's, also.</i>

443
00:27:44.747 --> 00:27:45.832
<i>We had stuff that was scripted,</i>

444
00:27:45.915 --> 00:27:48.084
<i>but in the script the hostages
were just retelling</i>

445
00:27:48.209 --> 00:27:51.420
<i>what we have already seen on camera.</i>

446
00:27:51.504 --> 00:27:58.177
<i>So just told D. and Chiwetel,</i>
"<i>Just interrogate the guys.</i>"

447
00:27:58.261 --> 00:27:59.262
And they called you what?

448
00:27:59.345 --> 00:28:01.389
They didn't call me anything.
They just told me...

449
00:28:01.472 --> 00:28:04.559
You're lying to me. Tell me the truth, now.
You're lying to me.

450
00:28:04.642 --> 00:28:06.477
Tell me the...
Look at me and tell me the truth.

451
00:28:06.561 --> 00:28:07.562
<i>All improv.</i>

452
00:28:07.645 --> 00:28:09.188
...AK-47s out. Four of them.

453
00:28:09.272 --> 00:28:11.107
- You know a lot about guns.
- No.

454
00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:14.068
- I don't know anything about guns, except...
- But you know they had an AK-47.

455
00:28:14.151 --> 00:28:17.446
- Everybody knows what an AK-47 is.
- Everybody?

456
00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:21.033
Anybody who's ever watched
a decent action movie would.

457
00:28:21.117 --> 00:28:22.201
You ever rob a bank before?

458
00:28:22.285 --> 00:28:24.036
<i>That's kind of ironic,</i> "<i>a decent action film"</i>

459
00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:28.875
<i>because when you look at it,
there's not that much action in this film.</i>

460
00:28:29.125 --> 00:28:32.128
<i>Again, another interrogation scene,
improvved.</i>

461
00:28:32.253 --> 00:28:34.630
That one time. That one time, that one time.

462
00:28:34.755 --> 00:28:36.507
<i>All this improv.</i>

463
00:28:36.632 --> 00:28:38.259
...my grandmother's pocketbook once.

464
00:28:39.343 --> 00:28:41.095
She was Polish.

465
00:28:41.971 --> 00:28:44.432
I used to go up to her and say...

466
00:28:44.515 --> 00:28:47.768
<i>You can't write better stuff than this,
I don't feel.</i>

467
00:28:47.852 --> 00:28:52.315
One day, I opened her pocketbook
and there was a nickel.

468
00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.150
I took it.

469
00:28:54.275 --> 00:28:57.194
That was the only thing I ever took.

470
00:29:00.323 --> 00:29:02.491
Look, Detective, I didn't mean
to give you a hard time back there.

471
00:29:02.575 --> 00:29:03.659
Forget about it.

472
00:29:03.743 --> 00:29:08.080
<i>Now, we're gonna walk from the cafe
which is across the street from the bank</i>

473
00:29:08.164 --> 00:29:13.294
<i>all the way back to M.C.C., M.C.C. meaning
the Mobile Command Center.</i>

474
00:29:13.377 --> 00:29:15.296
...if any cops came near the door,

475
00:29:15.379 --> 00:29:17.340
they'd throw out two dead bodies.

476
00:29:17.423 --> 00:29:18.925
He thinks there's four perps...

477
00:29:19.008 --> 00:29:22.637
<i>This is hand-held here, not Steadicam.</i>

478
00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:25.306
There's a video system in the bank.

479
00:29:25.389 --> 00:29:26.641
We're working on getting a download

480
00:29:26.724 --> 00:29:27.892
from Manhattan Trust's central...

481
00:29:27.975 --> 00:29:31.771
<i>It's a lot of dialog, this scene,
that's why we have the movement.</i>

482
00:29:31.854 --> 00:29:34.982
<i>In fact this is a very, very talkie film.</i>

483
00:29:35.066 --> 00:29:39.195
<i>So, Matty and I,
Matty Libatique again, the cameraman,</i>

484
00:29:39.278 --> 00:29:44.033
<i>he had to try to devise a visual style,</i>

485
00:29:44.116 --> 00:29:48.496
<i>so we'd not just have
stagnant talking heads.</i>

486
00:29:48.579 --> 00:29:51.749
<i>So, we just walked a block right here.</i>

487
00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:55.378
- 911?
- It's up on the screen.

488
00:29:55.461 --> 00:29:58.589
Any call about a bank
gets routed straight to us.

489
00:29:58.673 --> 00:30:02.385
Well, that's my end of it, Detective.

490
00:30:03.719 --> 00:30:05.096
Yeah.

491
00:30:05.846 --> 00:30:07.264
Yeah, I'm not calling them yet.

492
00:30:07.348 --> 00:30:08.349
Beg your pardon?

493
00:30:08.432 --> 00:30:11.811
<i>See that street behind them?
That's Wall Street, right there.</i>

494
00:30:11.894 --> 00:30:13.270
<i>That's Wall Street.</i>

495
00:30:13.354 --> 00:30:14.981
Let's see what he does.

496
00:30:16.732 --> 00:30:17.900
Your call.

497
00:30:26.075 --> 00:30:28.577
Now, Mr. Case, why don't you
let me explain to you how I work?

498
00:30:28.661 --> 00:30:31.122
<i>This location is Battery Park.</i>

499
00:30:31.205 --> 00:30:35.668
Well, you say that there are family heirlooms
inside your safety deposit box.

500
00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:37.420
That's fine.

501
00:30:37.503 --> 00:30:40.923
But in my experience, people like you
have people working for them

502
00:30:41.007 --> 00:30:42.508
that handle these kinds of things.

503
00:30:42.591 --> 00:30:44.844
And when they can't,
well, they don't call me.

504
00:30:44.927 --> 00:30:47.722
<i>This scene, look at two great pros,</i>

505
00:30:47.805 --> 00:30:51.892
<i>Jodie Foster and Christopher Plummer.</i>

506
00:30:52.768 --> 00:30:56.856
<i>When you're around Christopher Plummer,
any of you people who do get the chance</i>

507
00:30:56.939 --> 00:31:01.360
<i>to get the pleasure,</i>
<i>do not mention</i> The Sound of Music

508
00:31:01.444 --> 00:31:05.781
<i>around Christopher Plummer.
I'm telling you.</i>

509
00:31:05.865 --> 00:31:09.785
<i>Please do not mention</i>

510
00:31:09.869 --> 00:31:13.748
The Sound of Music <i>around</i>
<i>Christopher Plummer. You'll thank me.</i>

511
00:31:13.831 --> 00:31:15.666
What's inside that box, young lady,

512
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:19.045
has belonged to me
since before you were born.

513
00:31:19.128 --> 00:31:23.799
It's very valuable
and poses no danger whatsoever to anyone.

514
00:31:23.883 --> 00:31:26.677
Except you.

515
00:31:26.761 --> 00:31:29.388
Okay. Well, first,
there are men with guns in there,

516
00:31:29.472 --> 00:31:31.348
so I can't guarantee any results. Agreed?

517
00:31:31.432 --> 00:31:33.309
- Of course.
- All right.

518
00:31:33.392 --> 00:31:36.145
Now, what makes you think
that they want to rob your box?

519
00:31:36.228 --> 00:31:38.230
I don't.

520
00:31:38.314 --> 00:31:43.944
Well, why don't you tell me
how you would like this to end?

521
00:31:44.028 --> 00:31:49.283
I'd prefer that nobody
ever touch my safe deposit box.

522
00:31:49.366 --> 00:31:52.244
Not them, not you, not the authorities.

523
00:31:52.328 --> 00:31:55.748
<i>The thing I remember about this day,
is that the great screenwriter</i>

524
00:31:55.831 --> 00:32:01.295
<i>Budd Schulberg came to the set.
Budd won an Oscar for his script,</i>

525
00:32:01.378 --> 00:32:04.632
<i>Best Original Screenplay for</i>
On the Waterfront,

526
00:32:04.715 --> 00:32:08.094
<i>wrote the novels</i> The Harder They Fall,
What Makes Sammy Run?

527
00:32:08.177 --> 00:32:12.681
<i>In fact, Budd and I have written a script</i>
<i>call</i> Save Us, Joe Louis

528
00:32:12.765 --> 00:32:17.895
<i>which is about Joe Louis
and Max Schmeling, we co-wrote this script</i>

529
00:32:17.978 --> 00:32:21.982
<i>and we've been trying to get it made
for the last five, six, seven years.</i>

530
00:32:22.066 --> 00:32:26.320
<i>Hopefully it will get done.
Budd is 93 years old.</i>

531
00:32:26.403 --> 00:32:30.449
<i>In fact, Budd was at the second
Joe Louis-Max Schmeling fight,</i>

532
00:32:30.533 --> 00:32:34.662
<i>all the way back in 1938.</i>

533
00:32:35.538 --> 00:32:38.207
Clearly, they must have been satisfied.

534
00:32:45.923 --> 00:32:47.633
Steve?

535
00:32:47.716 --> 00:32:54.140
<i>Mr. Carlos Gómez. Carlos came in,
auditioned. He's a spoken word artist,</i>

536
00:32:54.223 --> 00:32:58.853
<i>he has that flow. And got the part.</i>

537
00:32:59.562 --> 00:33:01.021
Guess what I found?

538
00:33:02.565 --> 00:33:06.360
<i>I like the way we shot this.
This scene started without a focus</i>

539
00:33:06.443 --> 00:33:08.654
<i>and then we racked it back in.</i>

540
00:33:15.744 --> 00:33:17.329
Probably stolen.

541
00:33:17.413 --> 00:33:19.790
Have them run it and check it for prints.

542
00:33:22.126 --> 00:33:28.048
<i>Now, this is a set.
This Mobile Command Center is a set.</i>

543
00:33:28.132 --> 00:33:33.554
<i>The exteriors is on the street, the interiors
is on that stage in Brooklyn.</i>

544
00:33:38.434 --> 00:33:41.353
- Sure you got the right number?
- Absolutely.

545
00:33:51.947 --> 00:33:53.908
Okay. Nothing yet.

546
00:33:56.118 --> 00:33:57.203
We got video.

547
00:33:57.286 --> 00:34:01.707
<i>That's my man, Daryl</i> "<i>Chill" Mitchell.</i>

548
00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:03.751
What happened to that camera right there?

549
00:34:03.834 --> 00:34:06.670
Wait. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

550
00:34:06.754 --> 00:34:12.843
<i>Daryl's paralyzed from the waist down.
He got into a horrible motorcycle accident.</i>

551
00:34:12.927 --> 00:34:17.681
<i>And you can see he's in a wheelchair.
And every time I would see Daryl,</i>

552
00:34:17.765 --> 00:34:20.809
<i>he would say,</i> "<i>Spike,</i>
<i>can you put me down, put me down?"</i>

553
00:34:20.893 --> 00:34:24.563
<i>And I had a part for him in this film.</i>

554
00:34:26.148 --> 00:34:29.193
He could knock out the cameras
without no one knowing.

555
00:34:29.276 --> 00:34:31.570
He knocked out the cameras about 10:00.

556
00:34:31.654 --> 00:34:33.197
So, for approximately two minutes,

557
00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:36.659
we got no evidence of people
leaving or entering the bank. That's great.

558
00:34:38.077 --> 00:34:44.833
<i>Again, that's Marcia Jean Kurtz, she's one</i>
<i>of the hostages from</i> Dog Day Afternoon.

559
00:34:44.917 --> 00:34:49.588
They just told us to put our heads down.
And then close our eyes.

560
00:34:51.548 --> 00:34:52.633
And then I just remember one of them

561
00:34:52.716 --> 00:34:55.010
telling the others to just go down
and fix the cameras.

562
00:34:55.094 --> 00:34:56.095
The video cameras?

563
00:34:56.178 --> 00:35:00.266
<i>Again, this interrogation scene, improvised.</i>

564
00:35:00.349 --> 00:35:03.227
<i>Denzel does some great stuff here, too.
Playing with her.</i>

565
00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:05.604
Could you give us
the names of the bank robbers, maybe?

566
00:35:05.688 --> 00:35:07.648
I'm just messing with you, sweetheart.

567
00:35:07.731 --> 00:35:09.149
- You okay?
- Thank you.

568
00:35:09.233 --> 00:35:10.567
Okay.

569
00:35:10.776 --> 00:35:12.486
- It was pretty awful.
- Was it bad?

570
00:35:12.569 --> 00:35:14.989
I mean, they made us strip.

571
00:35:15.072 --> 00:35:19.493
They made us take off our clothes.

572
00:35:19.576 --> 00:35:22.121
I don't understand why they had to do that.

573
00:35:22.204 --> 00:35:23.580
I really just thought...

574
00:35:23.664 --> 00:35:26.834
I thought I was gonna be killed.

575
00:35:26.917 --> 00:35:27.918
Well.

576
00:35:30.045 --> 00:35:31.255
All right, my dear.

577
00:35:31.338 --> 00:35:32.298
"<i>All right, my dear.</i>"

578
00:35:32.381 --> 00:35:34.133
- I can go?
- No.

579
00:35:34.216 --> 00:35:36.802
- No?
- No, you got to stay.

580
00:35:36.885 --> 00:35:38.137
- You got to stay.
- No, you can go.

581
00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:40.472
No, stay. No, go.

582
00:35:40.556 --> 00:35:42.141
Did you rob the bank?

583
00:35:42.224 --> 00:35:43.475
- You did.
- Did you rob the bank?

584
00:35:43.559 --> 00:35:44.810
- No.
- You sure?

585
00:35:44.893 --> 00:35:47.271
- There's movement at the front door.
- Let's go.

586
00:35:50.983 --> 00:35:51.984
<i>Now,</i>

587
00:35:55.237 --> 00:36:01.368
<i>this is one of the ways we wanted to show
that we live in a post-9/11 world.</i>

588
00:36:01.452 --> 00:36:07.374
<i>Not just a post-9/11 New York City
but a 9/11 world.</i>

589
00:36:08.876 --> 00:36:10.669
<i>With this character right here.</i>

590
00:36:10.753 --> 00:36:11.879
Easy.

591
00:36:11.962 --> 00:36:15.174
- I can see him. I got a clear shot.
- Any weapons?

592
00:36:15.257 --> 00:36:17.509
- Who are you?
- Vikram Walia. I work in the bank.

593
00:36:17.593 --> 00:36:18.635
<i>Vikram.</i>

594
00:36:18.719 --> 00:36:19.803
Okay. Vikram? Is this a bomb?

595
00:36:19.887 --> 00:36:22.264
- Oh, shit! A fucking Arab!
- What? No. I'm a Sikh!

596
00:36:22.348 --> 00:36:23.932
- Answer me, Vikram. Is this a bomb?
- No.

597
00:36:24.016 --> 00:36:25.184
- Are you booby-trapped?
- No, fuck, no.

598
00:36:25.267 --> 00:36:29.855
<i>Most people don't know the difference
between a Sikh and an Arab.</i>

599
00:36:29.938 --> 00:36:35.361
<i>Anybody with a turban on their head,</i>
<i>or that racist comment</i> "<i>towelhead,</i>"

600
00:36:35.444 --> 00:36:39.281
<i>is a terrorist, you know, an AI-Qaeda
or the Taliban.</i>

601
00:36:39.365 --> 00:36:42.284
What the fuck are you doing?
Give me my turban back.

602
00:36:43.744 --> 00:36:46.372
<i>An Arab's now the new bogeyman.</i>

603
00:36:46.455 --> 00:36:51.752
<i>Supplanted the Russians, who supplanted
the Nazis. It's the Arabs now.</i>

604
00:36:55.214 --> 00:36:56.632
And the 11:00 and 12:00...

605
00:36:56.715 --> 00:36:59.551
And don't forget about your 1:00
with Chancellor Joel Klein.

606
00:36:59.635 --> 00:37:01.553
- Oh, Madge. What a day...
- Your Honor.

607
00:37:01.637 --> 00:37:06.308
<i>Peter Kybart, who plays
the Mayor of New York City.</i>

608
00:37:08.018 --> 00:37:13.107
<i>In no way, shape or form
is this supposed to be Mayor Bloomberg.</i>

609
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:16.902
<i>So don't even come here with that, please.</i>

610
00:37:16.985 --> 00:37:18.862
Who are we saving this week?

611
00:37:18.946 --> 00:37:20.531
Well, I'm doing a round of support

612
00:37:20.614 --> 00:37:23.325
for the Joseph Freidkin Memorial Fund
for Spinal Cord Research

613
00:37:23.409 --> 00:37:25.494
and we're having
our annual fundraiser next month.

614
00:37:25.577 --> 00:37:27.579
If you could attend,
it would give us such a boost.

615
00:37:27.663 --> 00:37:32.126
<i>Now there's a term coming up
there was some discussion about.</i>

616
00:37:32.209 --> 00:37:36.755
<i>At the end of this scene, the Mayor
tells Jodie Foster's character's name,</i>

617
00:37:36.839 --> 00:37:41.051
<i>Madeline White,</i>
<i>that she's a</i> "<i>magnificent cunt.</i>"

618
00:37:41.135 --> 00:37:43.804
<i>I asked Jodie,</i> "<i>Do you feel comfortable</i>
<i>with this?" She said,</i> "<i>Fine.</i>

619
00:37:43.887 --> 00:37:49.184
"<i>I want this character to be called that.</i>"
<i>I said,</i> "<i>Bet, it's in the movie.</i>"

620
00:37:49.268 --> 00:37:55.107
<i>But that is an ugly word,</i> "<i>cunt,</i>"
<i>a very ugly word. That's worse than</i> "<i>bitch.</i>"

621
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:56.775
<i>That's worse than</i> "<i>bitch" and</i> "<i>ho.</i>"

622
00:37:56.859 --> 00:37:59.236
You're out of your fucking mind.

623
00:37:59.862 --> 00:38:01.947
If it was easy,
it wouldn't square us, would it?

624
00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:05.784
<i>But you know,
it's hard out here to be a pimp.</i>

625
00:38:05.868 --> 00:38:08.245
<i>Bitches and ho's jumpin' ship.</i>

626
00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:11.039
I may have to give out a few.

627
00:38:11.206 --> 00:38:13.667
Then that's exactly what you'll do.

628
00:38:14.835 --> 00:38:16.962
You're a magnificent cunt.

629
00:38:20.132 --> 00:38:21.216
Thank you.

630
00:38:28.724 --> 00:38:31.185
It's unclear how many hostages are inside...

631
00:38:31.393 --> 00:38:35.939
<i>She's a real reporter forNY1, Sandra Endo.</i>

632
00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:39.443
...but has turned into this hostage situation.

633
00:38:40.903 --> 00:38:43.447
<i>That's these things they use now,</i>

634
00:38:43.989 --> 00:38:48.202
<i>see if there are bombs hidden underneath
armored vehicles.</i>

635
00:38:52.456 --> 00:38:55.959
<i>They're towing the van
that the robbers came in.</i>

636
00:38:57.002 --> 00:39:00.005
<i>Now this is a robot, for bombs and stuff.</i>

637
00:39:00.088 --> 00:39:04.343
<i>Now this scene right here, again,
this scene is improvised.</i>

638
00:39:04.426 --> 00:39:08.388
<i>I said,</i> "<i>Waris, think of all the times</i>
<i>since September 11,</i>

639
00:39:08.472 --> 00:39:13.560
"<i>where you've been suspected</i>
<i>of being bin Laden's brother.</i>

640
00:39:13.644 --> 00:39:16.813
"<i>And the treatment you received.</i>
<i>Because that's what this script is about.</i>"

641
00:39:16.897 --> 00:39:19.566
I don't need this. I need my turban.
It's part of my religion.

642
00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:21.944
- We'll get you your turban.
- We'll find it for you.

643
00:39:22.027 --> 00:39:24.696
No, no, no. Not "get me."
I want my turban now.

644
00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:27.032
You just got to start thinking
about the people inside the bank now.

645
00:39:27.115 --> 00:39:28.158
It's a dangerous situation.

646
00:39:28.242 --> 00:39:30.744
You got to start telling us
about what's going on inside the bank.

647
00:39:30.827 --> 00:39:33.205
We can talk about this later.
We'll get an officer to come down.

648
00:39:33.288 --> 00:39:34.873
You can write a formal complaint.

649
00:39:34.957 --> 00:39:37.417
But for now,
we got to deal with this situation.

650
00:39:37.501 --> 00:39:39.378
First you beat me,
and now you want my help.

651
00:39:39.461 --> 00:39:41.630
<i>That was improvised.</i>

652
00:39:42.464 --> 00:39:45.717
I could apologize on behalf of the NYPD,
but that was not us. We are detectives.

653
00:39:45.801 --> 00:39:47.761
- We're gonna try and find out...
- What do you want to know?

654
00:39:47.844 --> 00:39:50.556
- How many were there?
- I think there were about four.

655
00:39:50.639 --> 00:39:54.309
- How many hostages?
- I don't know how many hostages, 20, 30.

656
00:39:55.894 --> 00:40:00.065
I'm fucking tired of this shit.
What happened to my fucking civil rights?

657
00:40:00.148 --> 00:40:03.193
Why can't I go anywhere
without being harassed?

658
00:40:03.277 --> 00:40:05.070
Get thrown out of a bank.
I'm a hostage. I get harassed.

659
00:40:05.153 --> 00:40:06.238
I go to the airport.

660
00:40:06.321 --> 00:40:09.199
I can't go through security
without a "random" selection.

661
00:40:09.283 --> 00:40:11.368
Fucking random, my ass.
I nearly lost my job...

662
00:40:11.451 --> 00:40:13.495
I bet you can get a cab, though.

663
00:40:15.747 --> 00:40:21.587
<i>Now, for those who don't live in New York,
here's what that line is about.</i>

664
00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:25.757
<i>Most of the cab drivers in New York City</i>

665
00:40:25.841 --> 00:40:30.220
<i>are from Pakistan or India.</i>

666
00:40:30.304 --> 00:40:34.600
<i>Now here's the thing,
black people been here 400 years,</i>

667
00:40:34.683 --> 00:40:39.730
<i>and these people just got here
and black men still can't catch a cab.</i>

668
00:40:39.813 --> 00:40:44.359
<i>Them motherfuckers drive by me
all the time.</i>

669
00:40:44.443 --> 00:40:46.778
<i>That's why Denzel...
I mean, a couple of years ago,</i>

670
00:40:46.862 --> 00:40:50.699
<i>there was that famous thing where
Danny Glover didn't get picked up for a cab</i>

671
00:40:50.782 --> 00:40:52.784
<i>and there was a whole big brouhaha
behind that.</i>

672
00:40:52.868 --> 00:40:58.332
<i>That's why Denzel put that line there.
All right, you're persecuted, all that stuff,</i>

673
00:40:58.415 --> 00:41:02.461
<i>but at the same time,
you motherfuckers still get a cab.</i>

674
00:41:07.633 --> 00:41:12.471
<i>When Denzel said that line,
I screamed out loud.</i>

675
00:41:12.554 --> 00:41:17.184
<i>I would have liked to have a little more time,
a couple of seconds at least,</i>

676
00:41:17.267 --> 00:41:21.563
<i>after he says that line, but it cut right away
because you would've heard me screaming.</i>

677
00:41:24.566 --> 00:41:26.526
I'm so sorry. I must have misunderstood.

678
00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:28.695
That's quite all right, Mr. Case.

679
00:41:29.696 --> 00:41:31.490
Where can we reach you
if we need anything?

680
00:41:31.573 --> 00:41:33.659
Well, those are my people in there,
you know,

681
00:41:33.742 --> 00:41:36.828
and I would like to stay here for a while.
And I won't disturb you.

682
00:41:36.912 --> 00:41:38.914
<i>This kills me, too.</i>

683
00:41:41.291 --> 00:41:43.835
<i>I told Chris,</i>

684
00:41:43.919 --> 00:41:47.130
<i>I didn't tell the other guys,</i>
<i>I said,</i> "<i>Chris, sit down</i>

685
00:41:47.214 --> 00:41:48.590
"<i>like you wanna chill out there.</i>"

686
00:41:48.674 --> 00:41:49.675
And thank you all so much.

687
00:41:49.758 --> 00:41:52.427
- Thank you.
- This way, sir.

688
00:42:00.394 --> 00:42:03.271
<i>I like this crane shot.</i>

689
00:42:03.355 --> 00:42:08.068
<i>Come down from the perch,
the windows right opposite the bank door,</i>

690
00:42:13.615 --> 00:42:17.661
<i>come out with the note.
This is a Steadicam shot here.</i>

691
00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:20.288
<i>That's another camera.</i>

692
00:42:25.001 --> 00:42:26.002
<i>Now.</i>

693
00:42:26.878 --> 00:42:29.214
"Fifty hungry people need food now."

694
00:42:29.297 --> 00:42:31.717
<i>We had Willem Dafoe come back
and add that line.</i>

695
00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:34.886
<i>He did not say that line when we shot it.</i>

696
00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:38.223
<i>It was also very important
to be able to read that.</i>

697
00:42:38.724 --> 00:42:40.642
All right.
Are we ready with the listening devices?

698
00:42:40.726 --> 00:42:43.270
I'm gonna need 15 minutes
once we get the food.

699
00:42:43.353 --> 00:42:45.105
Pizza's the best. No sandwiches.

700
00:42:45.188 --> 00:42:47.607
- Is she for real?
- Are you for real?

701
00:42:47.691 --> 00:42:51.403
Well, if we send in, say,
10 pizzas boxes with transmitters,

702
00:42:51.486 --> 00:42:54.406
maybe we'll get some conversation
if we give them something to group around.

703
00:42:54.489 --> 00:42:56.158
Give them each a sandwich, it's hit or miss.

704
00:42:56.241 --> 00:42:59.244
They can move around
and I don't have 50 transmitters.

705
00:42:59.327 --> 00:43:01.413
- What's this?
- It's a digital recorder.

706
00:43:01.496 --> 00:43:03.415
You click it, and it'll record for half an hour.

707
00:43:03.498 --> 00:43:06.418
- James Bond shit.
- Well, you can get them on Amazon.

708
00:43:06.501 --> 00:43:08.670
- You gonna ask for a hostage?
- He already gave us one, didn't he?

709
00:43:08.754 --> 00:43:10.797
I ask for another one,
he says no, then what?

710
00:43:10.881 --> 00:43:12.924
No, he knows what he's doing.

711
00:43:13.008 --> 00:43:14.968
He gave us a hostage.
We'll give him some food.

712
00:43:15.051 --> 00:43:16.386
I don't want to get caught bluffing this guy.

713
00:43:22.976 --> 00:43:24.352
Fuck this shit. Look, they wanna...

714
00:43:24.436 --> 00:43:26.938
<i>That's James Ransone.</i>

715
00:43:27.022 --> 00:43:29.441
<i>One of my favorite TV shows is</i> The Wire.

716
00:43:30.692 --> 00:43:35.197
<i>And he was very important
about the second season.</i>

717
00:43:36.490 --> 00:43:40.702
<i>So we had him come in and read.</i>

718
00:43:40.786 --> 00:43:44.289
<i>The guy to the right of him is called Lemon,
Puerto Rican brother from New York,</i>

719
00:43:44.372 --> 00:43:47.918
<i>from Brooklyn in fact,</i>
<i>he was part of</i> Def Poetry Jam.

720
00:43:50.587 --> 00:43:53.298
I told you to shut up! Leave him!

721
00:43:53.381 --> 00:43:56.176
<i>So James gets dragged from one.</i>

722
00:43:56.259 --> 00:43:59.471
<i>See, the way Wynn Thomas designed
the offices,</i>

723
00:43:59.554 --> 00:44:02.891
<i>the offices open up into each other.</i>

724
00:44:02.974 --> 00:44:06.770
<i>So we can have this long corridor
if you open up the doors.</i>

725
00:44:29.292 --> 00:44:31.795
One guy did most of the talking.

726
00:44:31.878 --> 00:44:33.296
He told everyone else what to do.

727
00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:36.466
- So they were talking amongst themselves?
- We couldn't hear them.

728
00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:38.969
They had us in these rooms.

729
00:44:39.052 --> 00:44:42.305
The doors were locked all the time.

730
00:44:42.389 --> 00:44:44.015
We didn't know what they were doing.

731
00:44:44.099 --> 00:44:46.518
- Did you hear anything they said?
- I have problems with my hearing.

732
00:44:46.601 --> 00:44:48.395
- I see.
- I wear hearing aids.

733
00:44:48.478 --> 00:44:50.021
<i>Again, improvised.</i>

734
00:44:50.105 --> 00:44:51.356
- Where are they?
- They're in my ears.

735
00:44:51.439 --> 00:44:52.524
- Let's see.
- Let me see them.

736
00:44:52.607 --> 00:44:54.526
<i>And Denzel, I mean, he does this great.</i>

737
00:44:54.609 --> 00:44:55.777
That's your other one, there?

738
00:44:55.861 --> 00:44:57.445
What's the red part, there?
What does that do?

739
00:44:57.529 --> 00:44:58.530
<i>See, Dennis is rehearsed.</i>

740
00:44:58.613 --> 00:45:00.365
You need two different...

741
00:45:00.448 --> 00:45:02.534
- Distinguish right from left?
- Yeah.

742
00:45:02.617 --> 00:45:07.622
<i>I didn't even know he wore hearing aids
till he pulled that shit out of his ears.</i>

743
00:45:09.666 --> 00:45:13.837
<i>What Den's doing here is great.</i>
"<i>Steve? Steve. Is that your name?"</i>

744
00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:14.963
Steve-O?

745
00:45:15.130 --> 00:45:17.549
- How much are they gonna pay you?
- I'm sorry?

746
00:45:17.632 --> 00:45:19.885
- You heard me.
- No, I didn't.

747
00:45:19.968 --> 00:45:23.889
- How much are they going to pay you?
- Who's gonna pay me?

748
00:45:23.972 --> 00:45:26.933
- Were you involved in this robbery?
- Absolutely not.

749
00:45:27.017 --> 00:45:29.227
Were you involved in this situation?

750
00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:32.647
- What situation?
- Don't lie. Don't lie.

751
00:45:37.485 --> 00:45:41.740
<i>Now, the actor who has this line,</i>

752
00:45:43.283 --> 00:45:46.161
"<i>If he gives me a tip, I'm keeping it,</i>"

753
00:45:46.328 --> 00:45:49.205
<i>he was also in</i> Dog Day Afternoon.

754
00:45:49.289 --> 00:45:50.999
<i>His name is Lionel Pina.</i>

755
00:45:51.082 --> 00:45:52.542
If he gives us a tip, I'm keeping it.

756
00:45:52.626 --> 00:45:54.628
<i>That's him right there.</i>

757
00:45:54.711 --> 00:45:57.797
<i>In fact, in</i> Dog Day Afternoon <i>he's the one</i>

758
00:45:57.881 --> 00:46:01.468
<i>that delivers the pizzas to AI Pacino.</i>

759
00:46:01.551 --> 00:46:07.933
<i>So he's delivered... Think of this, people,
he's delivered pizza in two movies,</i>

760
00:46:08.016 --> 00:46:11.645
Dog Day Afternoon <i>and</i> Inside Man.

761
00:46:11.728 --> 00:46:15.523
<i>Also, if you look at the boxes
of those pizzas,</i>

762
00:46:15.607 --> 00:46:18.443
<i>the top of the box, if you read,</i>
<i>it says</i> "<i>Sal's Famous Pizzeria.</i>"

763
00:46:18.526 --> 00:46:19.778
<i>Now where's that from?</i>

764
00:46:19.861 --> 00:46:22.113
<i>Sal's Famous Pizzeria</i>
<i>is from</i> Do the Right Thing.

765
00:46:22.197 --> 00:46:26.993
<i>So Sal, his pizzeria was burnt down
in Brooklyn and they moved to Wall Street.</i>

766
00:46:27.285 --> 00:46:29.412
Nice talking to you.

767
00:46:58.566 --> 00:47:01.069
Shit. Fucking Russians.

768
00:47:01.152 --> 00:47:03.989
Call Operations. See if they can get
a Russian translator over here ASAP.

769
00:47:04.072 --> 00:47:05.824
And get some fucking body bags.

770
00:47:05.907 --> 00:47:07.909
I hope you know what you're doing.

771
00:47:07.993 --> 00:47:10.453
Because if my guys got to shoot it out
with those fucking savages...

772
00:47:10.537 --> 00:47:12.831
Okay, okay, okay. Mitch?

773
00:47:12.914 --> 00:47:14.582
Check with either one of the hostages.

774
00:47:14.666 --> 00:47:19.254
Find out if they heard any Russian
or Russian accents when they were in there.

775
00:47:19.337 --> 00:47:20.547
We'll be all right.

776
00:47:25.593 --> 00:47:29.556
<i>Kim Director right there.
She's been in several of my films.</i>

777
00:47:30.932 --> 00:47:33.184
<i>And Kim and Samantha,</i>

778
00:47:34.436 --> 00:47:36.521
<i>they wanted there to be similarities
because of their,</i>

779
00:47:36.604 --> 00:47:38.732
<i>how should we say this, their cup size.</i>

780
00:47:40.066 --> 00:47:43.278
<i>That's something that the detectives
are going by.</i>

781
00:47:44.029 --> 00:47:45.864
<i>And this is where the robbers,
the bank robbers,</i>

782
00:47:45.947 --> 00:47:49.451
<i>do this old switcheroo right here.</i>

783
00:47:51.745 --> 00:47:55.165
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go. Let's go.

784
00:47:55.248 --> 00:47:57.667
Stop crying! Shut the fuck up!

785
00:48:01.337 --> 00:48:04.841
Get in there! Sit down! Put your masks on!

786
00:48:05.967 --> 00:48:08.136
Come on, let's go. Come on, boobs.

787
00:48:08.219 --> 00:48:12.223
- "Boobs"? Who the fuck you talking to?
- Let's go. You heard me! Shut the fuck up!

788
00:48:12.307 --> 00:48:13.725
- Why?
- Move that fat ass! Let's go! Come on!

789
00:48:13.808 --> 00:48:15.060
<i>That's Samantha right there.</i>

790
00:48:15.143 --> 00:48:18.271
If you don't shut the fuck up,
I'm gonna put my foot up your fat ass!

791
00:48:23.151 --> 00:48:25.111
Put your masks on!

792
00:48:25.195 --> 00:48:27.447
Put your hands on the ground!

793
00:48:36.164 --> 00:48:39.209
<i>Now this is real right here.
She really hits her head.</i>

794
00:48:40.251 --> 00:48:41.961
<i>She had a knot on her head,</i>

795
00:48:42.045 --> 00:48:44.005
<i>right here.</i>

796
00:48:46.174 --> 00:48:47.842
<i>That was an accident,</i>

797
00:48:47.926 --> 00:48:51.054
<i>but she had a little knot on the side
of her head right there.</i>

798
00:48:55.016 --> 00:48:57.435
She was on line in front of me.

799
00:48:57.519 --> 00:48:59.771
He was the teller on my line.

800
00:48:59.854 --> 00:49:03.608
This guy was to my right
and his kid was in front of him.

801
00:49:03.691 --> 00:49:06.194
He was playing with a video game.

802
00:49:06.277 --> 00:49:07.529
I remember her.

803
00:49:07.612 --> 00:49:11.449
- Why do you remember her?
- Great tits.

804
00:49:11.533 --> 00:49:15.829
- You remember seeing any of them after?
- Yeah, I saw her one time afterwards.

805
00:49:15.912 --> 00:49:19.999
- How are you sure you saw her again?
- I could see under the suit.

806
00:49:20.083 --> 00:49:21.626
Can't hide quality like that.

807
00:49:21.709 --> 00:49:24.462
This guy, he almost got us all killed.

808
00:49:24.546 --> 00:49:25.588
How?

809
00:49:25.672 --> 00:49:27.841
They put eight or nine of us
in an office for a while.

810
00:49:27.924 --> 00:49:32.095
This guy took off his mask
and was talking like he wasn't afraid.

811
00:49:32.178 --> 00:49:34.556
"I don't have to wear this damn mask,"
you know?

812
00:49:34.639 --> 00:49:38.560
So, they come in, pull him out of the room
and smack him around a little.

813
00:49:39.936 --> 00:49:42.230
- You see him again after that?
- No.

814
00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:44.691
- Was he okay?
- Seemed fine.

815
00:49:45.942 --> 00:49:52.365
- You recognize anyone else from that room?
- I can't be sure about the others.

816
00:49:52.448 --> 00:49:54.450
No one?

817
00:49:54.534 --> 00:49:57.328
- Why don't you keep looking?
- You know, I was terrified.

818
00:49:57.412 --> 00:49:58.997
What about before it began?

819
00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:00.874
You didn't look around
while you were waiting in line?

820
00:50:00.957 --> 00:50:03.001
I was talking to my girlfriend on the phone.

821
00:50:03.084 --> 00:50:07.172
<i>The detective is trying to be slick,
trying to sneak a peek.</i>

822
00:50:07.255 --> 00:50:09.549
You wanna take another picture?

823
00:50:09.632 --> 00:50:11.968
I could bend over and pick up a pencil.

824
00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:14.012
Whatever.

825
00:50:14.637 --> 00:50:16.055
This guy.

826
00:50:16.764 --> 00:50:18.308
Asshole.

827
00:50:22.395 --> 00:50:24.939
<i>Now we cut to Kim Director's breast.</i>

828
00:50:39.704 --> 00:50:42.165
What the fuck? This ain't Russian.

829
00:50:43.541 --> 00:50:45.501
No? What the hell is it?

830
00:50:45.585 --> 00:50:48.213
It's not Polish. Not Hungarian.

831
00:50:48.296 --> 00:50:51.049
Bulgarian, maybe.

832
00:50:51.132 --> 00:50:53.384
It's Central European. Sort of.

833
00:50:53.468 --> 00:50:55.887
That's it?
I mean, you're the language expert.

834
00:50:55.970 --> 00:50:58.306
What? No.

835
00:50:58.389 --> 00:51:00.600
- What do you think?
- Well, okay.

836
00:51:00.683 --> 00:51:02.936
<i>Again, this is a set.</i>

837
00:51:03.102 --> 00:51:06.439
<i>I'm gonna cut to the real M.C.C. on a street.</i>

838
00:51:07.607 --> 00:51:09.275
<i>There's a crane shot.</i>

839
00:51:10.485 --> 00:51:15.740
<i>That's... Goes from the air
as Denzel goes down the block.</i>

840
00:51:15.823 --> 00:51:19.661
<i>Now all those people, not at the rear,
but behind,</i>

841
00:51:19.744 --> 00:51:23.748
<i>those aren't extras. Those are just people
on Wall Street, who just are watching.</i>

842
00:51:23.831 --> 00:51:26.709
<i>Now coming right here
is my main man Al Palagonia.</i>

843
00:51:26.793 --> 00:51:31.673
<i>You might remember Al from</i>
He Got Game, <i>played the agent.</i>

844
00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:33.841
<i>Again.</i>

845
00:51:35.176 --> 00:51:40.515
<i>Part of the 40 Acres & A Mule softball team.
AI's a great, great player. Funny too.</i>

846
00:51:44.477 --> 00:51:45.687
Whoa.

847
00:51:46.729 --> 00:51:48.314
<i>AI, from Howard Beach.</i>

848
00:51:48.398 --> 00:51:50.108
I have no idea what they're saying.

849
00:51:50.191 --> 00:51:52.026
You got no idea?
I thought you said you spoke Albanian.

850
00:51:52.110 --> 00:51:53.194
No. I never said I speak Albanian.

851
00:51:53.278 --> 00:51:54.445
You said you spoke Albanian.

852
00:51:54.529 --> 00:51:55.613
I never said I speak Albanian.

853
00:51:55.697 --> 00:51:56.990
Well, how do you know it's Albanian?

854
00:51:57.073 --> 00:51:58.950
My ex-wife and her parents are Albanian.

855
00:51:59.033 --> 00:52:00.952
Her parents couldn't speak English for shit.

856
00:52:01.035 --> 00:52:02.036
"<i>For shit.</i>"

857
00:52:02.203 --> 00:52:05.290
...but I'll tell you right now
that the language is 100% Albanian.

858
00:52:05.373 --> 00:52:07.083
- 100%?
- "<i>100%.</i>"

859
00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:10.211
Call the Albanian Consulate.
See if they can get somebody over here

860
00:52:10.295 --> 00:52:12.046
to translate this for us. Make it happen fast.

861
00:52:12.130 --> 00:52:14.007
Okay, you hang out
in the back for me, okay?

862
00:52:14.090 --> 00:52:15.466
"<i>Not again.</i>"

863
00:52:16.009 --> 00:52:19.470
Van was stolen two days ago, but it's clean.
No prints.

864
00:52:19.554 --> 00:52:21.848
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

865
00:52:21.931 --> 00:52:22.974
Albanian?

866
00:52:23.057 --> 00:52:26.686
My man, like I told you, 100% Albanian.

867
00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:29.897
Undeniable.

868
00:52:33.318 --> 00:52:35.486
<i>This is one of my favorite scenes.</i>

869
00:52:35.862 --> 00:52:36.988
<i>Right here.</i>

870
00:52:40.074 --> 00:52:42.577
<i>And again it was not scripted.</i>

871
00:52:43.870 --> 00:52:46.831
<i>But I really wanted to make a comment</i>

872
00:52:46.914 --> 00:52:49.917
<i>on this bullshit, this gangster rap,</i>

873
00:52:50.918 --> 00:52:55.548
<i>infatuation with violence.
That shit is just so dumb.</i>

874
00:52:56.382 --> 00:53:00.261
<i>It's stupid, it's ignorant
and it ain't about shit.</i>

875
00:53:01.596 --> 00:53:05.558
<i>And even though we do mention 50 Cent,
and he's not the only guy.</i>

876
00:53:05.641 --> 00:53:08.353
<i>I'm not out to crucify 50 Cent.</i>

877
00:53:08.436 --> 00:53:13.232
<i>He didn't invent gangster rap,
he's not the only one.</i>

878
00:53:13.316 --> 00:53:15.318
<i>Now, we made this up.</i>

879
00:53:15.401 --> 00:53:17.111
How does this game work?

880
00:53:17.487 --> 00:53:19.697
You get points for doing dirt,
like jacking a car...

881
00:53:19.781 --> 00:53:21.908
<i>So you get points for killing people.</i>

882
00:53:21.991 --> 00:53:25.703
And you lose points
if someone jacks your ride or shoots you.

883
00:53:25.828 --> 00:53:29.374
<i>So we found this animation house,
it was good. I said,</i>

884
00:53:29.457 --> 00:53:32.877
"<i>Look, we want this</i>
<i>to be the most violent game ever.</i>"

885
00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:34.295
<i>Kill that nigger!</i>

886
00:53:35.296 --> 00:53:38.883
<i>Look at that, put the grenade in the mouth,
blow the head up.</i>

887
00:53:38.966 --> 00:53:40.301
<i>You win the game.</i>

888
00:53:40.385 --> 00:53:42.261
Like my man 50 says...

889
00:53:42.345 --> 00:53:43.471
"<i>Like my man 50 says...</i>"

890
00:53:43.554 --> 00:53:44.639
"Get rich or die tryin'."

891
00:53:44.722 --> 00:53:49.894
<i>See, that shit,</i> "<i>Get rich or die tryin',</i>"
<i>that shit is pure genocide.</i>

892
00:53:49.977 --> 00:53:51.938
You trying to get paid, too.

893
00:53:57.026 --> 00:54:02.740
<i>I don't care what I gotta do,
I don't care if I gotta steal, shoot, maim, rob,</i>

894
00:54:02.824 --> 00:54:06.202
<i>do all kinds of crazy shit,
as long as I get my money,</i>

895
00:54:06.285 --> 00:54:10.415
<i>then it's all right.
I'm sorry, that is not all right.</i>

896
00:54:10.498 --> 00:54:14.293
<i>So, I'm not on Interscope Records,
so fuck them, I don't care.</i>

897
00:54:14.377 --> 00:54:16.587
<i>You know what,
Jimmy Iovine does not own me.</i>

898
00:54:16.671 --> 00:54:18.923
It's gonna be okay.

899
00:54:19.006 --> 00:54:20.007
Cool.

900
00:54:21.175 --> 00:54:23.094
You'll be home soon.

901
00:54:23.177 --> 00:54:24.512
That's whassup.

902
00:54:30.685 --> 00:54:31.686
- Sir?
- Yeah.

903
00:54:31.769 --> 00:54:33.396
- No luck with the Albanian Consulate.
- What do you mean?

904
00:54:33.479 --> 00:54:35.773
I couldn't tell what the guy
was talking about. I think he wanted money.

905
00:54:35.857 --> 00:54:37.900
And I tried the State Department.
That takes a month.

906
00:54:37.984 --> 00:54:38.985
Okay.

907
00:54:39.902 --> 00:54:41.612
- Call her.
- Are you crazy?

908
00:54:41.696 --> 00:54:43.865
- I hate that bitch. Come on.
- You said she speaks Albanian, right?

909
00:54:43.948 --> 00:54:46.159
- Yeah, she was born there.
- Call her.

910
00:54:46.576 --> 00:54:48.202
I'm gonna regret this.

911
00:54:52.665 --> 00:54:57.253
<i>Now this is the scene where we reveal
Clive's face for the first time. Fully.</i>

912
00:54:57.336 --> 00:55:02.258
<i>And so Terence Blanchard wrote music
I feel was very appropriate for it, too.</i>

913
00:55:28.493 --> 00:55:30.703
- Who's Detective Frazier?
- Right here.

914
00:55:30.786 --> 00:55:33.414
- I have Ilina Maria over here.
- Miritia.

915
00:55:33.498 --> 00:55:34.916
- Oh, how you doing?
- Hello.

916
00:55:34.999 --> 00:55:36.834
How you doing?

917
00:55:36.918 --> 00:55:40.171
- What's this?
- Parking tickets. You can fix them?

918
00:55:42.215 --> 00:55:44.258
Yeah, I'll see what I can do.

919
00:55:44.342 --> 00:55:46.677
Can you listen to this
and tell us what they're saying?

920
00:55:46.761 --> 00:55:48.804
You can't smoke in here.

921
00:55:51.974 --> 00:55:53.559
Shit. Go ahead.

922
00:56:03.653 --> 00:56:06.322
What's so funny?
What, you know what they're talking about?

923
00:56:06.405 --> 00:56:09.825
I know what they're talking about.
I even know who it is.

924
00:56:09.909 --> 00:56:12.036
You know who it is?
You mean you know their names?

925
00:56:12.119 --> 00:56:13.496
- Who? I mean, who is it?
- Parking tickets?

926
00:56:13.579 --> 00:56:16.374
- They're taken care of. Who is it?
- It's Enver Hoxha.

927
00:56:16.457 --> 00:56:19.126
- Who?
- He was the president of Albania.

928
00:56:19.919 --> 00:56:21.045
Wait.

929
00:56:21.128 --> 00:56:23.464
You're telling me the former president
of Albania is in there robbing a bank?

930
00:56:23.548 --> 00:56:24.840
Enver Hoxha's dead.

931
00:56:24.924 --> 00:56:28.177
That's a tape of him discussing
how Albanian people are great people.

932
00:56:28.261 --> 00:56:31.180
They are immortal people. I wouldn't worry.

933
00:56:32.515 --> 00:56:34.600
It's a tape. You're sure about that?

934
00:56:34.850 --> 00:56:36.811
I had to listen to all this nonsense
in school.

935
00:56:36.894 --> 00:56:41.357
"Communism is great. Capitalism is evil.
Lenin, Marx, blah, blah, blah."

936
00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:43.401
It's Enver Hoxha. It's a tape.

937
00:56:43.484 --> 00:56:47.113
Okay. Okay, well,
Officer, you can take her home.

938
00:56:47.196 --> 00:56:50.616
And do me a favor, huh?
Watch where you park next time, okay?

939
00:56:57.832 --> 00:56:59.333
So, they're playing tapes for us now.

940
00:56:59.417 --> 00:57:00.918
They knew we were gonna bug them.

941
00:57:01.002 --> 00:57:03.504
Yeah, you're damn right they knew we were
gonna bug them. And they knew how.

942
00:57:03.588 --> 00:57:05.423
What makes it even worse,
they wanted us to bug them

943
00:57:05.506 --> 00:57:07.258
so they could send us
on a wild goose chase.

944
00:57:07.341 --> 00:57:10.261
Last time I had my johnson
pulled that good, it cost me $5.

945
00:57:10.344 --> 00:57:12.096
$5?

946
00:57:12.179 --> 00:57:14.348
Yeah, Tijuana. Don't ask.

947
00:57:14.849 --> 00:57:16.601
<i>Denzel added that line right there.</i>

948
00:57:16.684 --> 00:57:18.060
Oh, fuck that.

949
00:57:39.665 --> 00:57:42.043
<i>This is where we reveal the bug.</i>

950
00:57:44.629 --> 00:57:47.048
<i>Or the fact they are being bugged.</i>

951
00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:55.723
<i>This is Kim Director.</i>

952
00:58:06.233 --> 00:58:12.239
<i>She had to take a quick lock-picking course.</i>

953
00:58:15.242 --> 00:58:18.704
<i>There's this look coming up where she gives</i>

954
00:58:19.955 --> 00:58:24.502
<i>Clive's character. It's like a hint.
Like, that's her man.</i>

955
00:58:24.585 --> 00:58:29.090
"<i>Look how powerful</i>
<i>and so smart my man is, I love you so.</i>"

956
00:58:29.173 --> 00:58:31.300
<i>Where is it? It's coming up.</i>

957
00:58:31.801 --> 00:58:33.427
<i>Where's that look, Kim?</i>

958
00:58:33.844 --> 00:58:35.262
<i>Right there.</i>

959
00:58:36.555 --> 00:58:37.932
<i>Yeah, buddy.</i>

960
00:58:54.115 --> 00:58:58.035
<i>Here comes Denzel's heroic shot,
one of the many.</i>

961
00:58:58.119 --> 00:59:00.287
<i>And, right here.</i>

962
00:59:01.622 --> 00:59:03.332
<i>The Denzel heroic shot.</i>

963
00:59:04.041 --> 00:59:09.046
<i>Crane up from the shoes,
the Mayor's car coming down the block.</i>

964
00:59:11.465 --> 00:59:12.591
<i>Gets in.</i>

965
00:59:12.675 --> 00:59:15.094
- Detective Frazier. Nice to meet you.
- My pleasure.

966
00:59:15.177 --> 00:59:16.387
This is Madeline White.

967
00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:18.556
- How do you do, Miss White?
- It's an honor, Detective.

968
00:59:18.639 --> 00:59:21.434
Miss White may be able to assist you.

969
00:59:21.517 --> 00:59:24.770
Good. Good. What do you have in mind?

970
00:59:24.854 --> 00:59:28.357
She has a certain amount of influence
in these matters

971
00:59:28.441 --> 00:59:31.861
for reasons which I can't share with you.

972
00:59:33.571 --> 00:59:34.780
What are you trying to say, sir?

973
00:59:34.864 --> 00:59:38.117
What the Mayor means
is that there are matters at stake here

974
00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:40.870
that are a little bit above your pay grade.
No offense.

975
00:59:40.953 --> 00:59:43.164
And he's offering to help you.

976
00:59:44.039 --> 00:59:47.793
Well, why don't you just tell the Mayor
to raise my pay grade to the proper level

977
00:59:47.877 --> 00:59:49.420
and problem solved.

978
00:59:49.503 --> 00:59:51.297
From what I hear, that would have happened
a long time ago

979
00:59:51.380 --> 00:59:55.801
if you'd been a little bit more diplomatic.
But we can certainly discuss it.

980
00:59:55.885 --> 00:59:58.387
Look, I'm kidding. I mean,
I make First Grade when I make First Grade.

981
00:59:58.471 --> 01:00:01.348
You want to speed that up,
I'm not gonna talk you out of it.

982
01:00:01.432 --> 01:00:04.727
Then there's also the matter of $140,000
that seems to have walked away

983
01:00:04.810 --> 01:00:06.771
from the Madrugada check-cashing bust.

984
01:00:06.854 --> 01:00:08.481
Oh, I see.

985
01:00:09.732 --> 01:00:12.693
Well, I had nothing to do with that.

986
01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:15.780
Yeah, Collins, we got snipers
in the windows here.

987
01:00:15.863 --> 01:00:17.656
We got guys in the building next door.

988
01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:22.453
<i>Putting the lights up. Stuff like this shows</i>

989
01:00:22.536 --> 01:00:26.123
<i>where you are time wise,
instead of just cutting to a clock.</i>

990
01:00:27.249 --> 01:00:29.668
- Well?
- Is this the President of Albania?

991
01:00:29.835 --> 01:00:31.712
- Speaking.
- Pretty funny.

992
01:00:32.046 --> 01:00:34.882
- You shouldn't eavesdrop on people.
- Well, you better get used to it, pal.

993
01:00:34.965 --> 01:00:37.092
There's not gonna be much privacy
where you're going.

994
01:00:37.176 --> 01:00:38.302
You're damn right.

995
01:00:38.385 --> 01:00:41.347
This time next week,
I'll be sucking down piña coladas

996
01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:44.642
in a hot tub with six girls
named Amber and Tiffany.

997
01:00:44.725 --> 01:00:47.853
More like taking a shower with two guys
named Jamal and Jesus,

998
01:00:47.937 --> 01:00:50.523
if you know what I mean.
And here's the bad news,

999
01:00:50.606 --> 01:00:53.067
that thing you're sucking on,
it's not a piña colada.

1000
01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:55.194
"<i>A piña colada.</i>"

1001
01:00:56.070 --> 01:01:00.491
- Maybe you like that kind of thing, huh?
- You really want to piss me off.

1002
01:01:00.574 --> 01:01:01.659
All right, here's where we stand.

1003
01:01:01.742 --> 01:01:04.537
I don't need
your fucking status report, Serpico.

1004
01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:08.874
Serpico, <i>another homage</i>
<i>to another great film</i>

1005
01:01:08.958 --> 01:01:12.336
<i>by New York director, Sidney Lumet.</i>

1006
01:01:12.419 --> 01:01:15.631
Serpico, <i>starring AI Pacino.</i>

1007
01:01:15.756 --> 01:01:17.508
Very clear.
I'm trying to get you what you want.

1008
01:01:17.591 --> 01:01:19.510
But you got to understand this.

1009
01:01:19.593 --> 01:01:23.180
You know, it's not like the City of New York
has 747s waiting around for days like today.

1010
01:01:23.264 --> 01:01:24.348
I understand that...

1011
01:01:24.431 --> 01:01:27.101
<i>Oh, I'd like to say,</i>

1012
01:01:27.268 --> 01:01:30.729
<i>most of the scenes in this movie</i>

1013
01:01:30.813 --> 01:01:35.025
<i>where Denzel and Clive are on the phone,</i>

1014
01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:36.777
<i>they're actually doing it at the same time.</i>

1015
01:01:36.861 --> 01:01:41.657
<i>It's a studio, so we have a camera
in the set for here on M.C.C.</i>

1016
01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:43.784
<i>and we have a camera on the bank set.</i>

1017
01:01:43.868 --> 01:01:47.997
<i>So they were actually talking to each other
while we were filming this.</i>

1018
01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:49.748
<i>We had two cameras,
they were talking to each other</i>

1019
01:01:49.832 --> 01:01:52.126
<i>on two different parts of the set.</i>

1020
01:01:58.465 --> 01:02:00.384
<i>Another crane shot I love.</i>

1021
01:02:00.467 --> 01:02:02.887
<i>Start here, go across the bank</i>

1022
01:02:02.970 --> 01:02:07.975
<i>and end up on Jodie sitting
in the window in the coffee shop.</i>

1023
01:02:10.144 --> 01:02:14.398
<i>Terence's theme again for the E.S.U.</i>

1024
01:02:17.735 --> 01:02:20.529
<i>And we end up on Jodie in the window.</i>

1025
01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:36.170
<i>A lot of crane shots in this film.</i>

1026
01:02:45.679 --> 01:02:48.390
- So, Mr. Damerjian...
- Damerjian.

1027
01:02:48.474 --> 01:02:50.643
- Damerjian. Is that Albanian?
- Just call me Kenneth.

1028
01:02:50.726 --> 01:02:52.937
- Kenneth?
- Is that Albanian or...

1029
01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:54.813
It's Armenian.

1030
01:02:54.897 --> 01:02:55.940
What's the difference?

1031
01:02:56.023 --> 01:02:59.234
<i>I like this...</i>

1032
01:02:59.318 --> 01:03:01.320
<i>Albanian, Armenian...</i>

1033
01:03:02.529 --> 01:03:06.492
<i>Let's be honest, most Americans
don't know the geography of United States,</i>

1034
01:03:06.575 --> 01:03:09.078
<i>alone the world.</i>

1035
01:03:10.037 --> 01:03:12.706
"<i>My throat is parched.</i>"

1036
01:03:17.169 --> 01:03:18.712
<i>Denzel...</i>

1037
01:03:18.921 --> 01:03:22.925
<i>Denzel broke out laughing when he said,</i>
"<i>My throat is parched.</i>"

1038
01:03:23.008 --> 01:03:24.927
I didn't know they were robbing the bank
until they pulled a gun in my face.

1039
01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:26.053
Is that why you held the door open
for them?

1040
01:03:26.136 --> 01:03:27.680
How do you know they robbed the bank?

1041
01:03:27.763 --> 01:03:28.973
Because they pulled a gun in my face...

1042
01:03:29.056 --> 01:03:30.307
That doesn't mean they were
robbing the bank.

1043
01:03:30.391 --> 01:03:31.976
Did they take money?
Did you see them take money?

1044
01:03:32.059 --> 01:03:35.813
I was in a bank and I was locked up
for who knows how long.

1045
01:03:35.896 --> 01:03:38.732
- Okay.
- Tied up in a room. I saw you see me.

1046
01:03:38.816 --> 01:03:40.484
You saw me see you?

1047
01:03:40.567 --> 01:03:43.988
<i>I saw you see me see... What?</i>

1048
01:03:44.071 --> 01:03:46.365
Listen, I can't work miracles over here.
I'm gonna need more time.

1049
01:03:46.448 --> 01:03:47.658
Well, perhaps if you'd...

1050
01:03:47.741 --> 01:03:51.036
<i>Again, once again,</i>

1051
01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:53.580
<i>these two actors have been
shot simultaneously.</i>

1052
01:03:54.957 --> 01:03:56.583
Okay, listen.

1053
01:03:57.668 --> 01:04:00.671
I promise you, as God is my witness,
I'm working on it as hard as I can.

1054
01:04:00.754 --> 01:04:04.842
<i>Denzel's being shot on the M.C.C. set</i>

1055
01:04:04.925 --> 01:04:08.971
<i>and Clive is on the other end
on the bank set</i>

1056
01:04:09.054 --> 01:04:11.473
<i>on the same stage.</i>

1057
01:04:11.974 --> 01:04:14.685
<i>They're talking to each other on the phone.</i>

1058
01:04:15.144 --> 01:04:16.770
<i>I mean, if we could work it like that
we'd love it,</i>

1059
01:04:16.854 --> 01:04:21.775
<i>where we could shoot both actors
on either end of the phone at the same time.</i>

1060
01:04:23.277 --> 01:04:25.571
Which weighs more?

1061
01:04:25.904 --> 01:04:28.991
All the trains that pass through
Grand Central Station in a year,

1062
01:04:30.242 --> 01:04:33.620
or the trees cut down to print
all US currency in circulation?

1063
01:04:33.871 --> 01:04:35.080
Here's a hint...

1064
01:04:35.164 --> 01:04:36.206
<i>You know, this riddle stuff,</i>

1065
01:04:36.290 --> 01:04:39.418
<i>I didn't even know they had this stuff</i>
<i>in</i> Die Hard,

1066
01:04:39.501 --> 01:04:43.672
<i>in one of those films, not the first one,
as a riddle.</i>

1067
01:04:43.756 --> 01:04:46.884
<i>Because I found out about it afterwards.</i>

1068
01:04:46.967 --> 01:04:49.887
<i>If I'd have known about that before
we wouldn't have had this riddle stuff.</i>

1069
01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:52.097
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. 100%.

1070
01:04:52.431 --> 01:04:53.724
Okay.

1071
01:04:58.645 --> 01:04:59.730
I got it.

1072
01:04:59.813 --> 01:05:02.733
- Wait a second. Wait a second.
- I'll call you back.

1073
01:05:02.816 --> 01:05:04.485
<i>Call right back.</i>

1074
01:05:06.987 --> 01:05:09.031
It's a trap. They both weigh the same.

1075
01:05:09.114 --> 01:05:11.825
Tell him they both weigh the same.
They both weigh nothing.

1076
01:05:11.909 --> 01:05:13.577
They both weigh nothing
or they both weigh the same?

1077
01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:14.828
Tell him they both weigh the same.

1078
01:05:14.912 --> 01:05:16.580
Tell him they both weigh the same.
Do it now.

1079
01:05:16.663 --> 01:05:18.290
They both weigh the same. Got it.

1080
01:05:22.377 --> 01:05:25.089
- Well?
- They both weigh the same.

1081
01:05:25.172 --> 01:05:26.840
This time, send sandwiches.

1082
01:05:28.425 --> 01:05:31.095
That's pretty good. This guy's nuts.

1083
01:05:31.178 --> 01:05:33.555
He said, "Grand Central Station."

1084
01:05:33.764 --> 01:05:36.350
Grand Central Terminal is the train station.

1085
01:05:36.433 --> 01:05:38.685
- Grand Central Station is the post office.
- Is the post office.

1086
01:05:38.769 --> 01:05:40.395
- He's wrong.
- Who's wrong?

1087
01:05:40.521 --> 01:05:44.525
Perp One.
Trains don't pass through Grand Central.

1088
01:05:44.775 --> 01:05:45.943
It's the last stop for every train.

1089
01:05:46.026 --> 01:05:48.737
- What about the subway? They run through.
- Metro-North goes there.

1090
01:05:48.821 --> 01:05:50.280
- How the fuck do you know?
- Metro-North goes there!

1091
01:05:50.364 --> 01:05:51.740
No. Metro-North starts there.

1092
01:05:51.824 --> 01:05:54.118
What are you guys talking about?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

1093
01:05:54.201 --> 01:05:57.538
- Metro-North goes through!
- Let's just get the sandwiches.

1094
01:05:58.872 --> 01:06:01.792
- Metro-North...
- Deal is, he said, "Passes through."

1095
01:06:01.875 --> 01:06:04.461
Yeah, but the Metro-North goes up
there, though.

1096
01:06:04.545 --> 01:06:06.338
Look, shut up. It doesn't matter, anyway.

1097
01:06:06.463 --> 01:06:09.299
I know what he meant. What he said
is one thing, but what he meant is another.

1098
01:06:09.383 --> 01:06:11.969
- Yeah. That's always a problem, isn't it?
- Sandwiches.

1099
01:06:12.052 --> 01:06:13.345
I'm on it, I'm on it.

1100
01:06:16.890 --> 01:06:19.059
You know, right now I could go for
a nice kosher hot dog and a beer.

1101
01:06:19.143 --> 01:06:21.478
I had Met tickets tonight.
And Pedro's pitching!

1102
01:06:21.562 --> 01:06:23.147
They're gonna get their asses
kicked anyway.

1103
01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:25.649
- Tell me about it. I'm better off here.
- I'm glad they didn't separate us.

1104
01:06:25.732 --> 01:06:28.652
- Do you think they're terrorists?
- They're robbers, not terrorists.

1105
01:06:28.735 --> 01:06:30.487
How do you know? They could be AI-Qaeda.

1106
01:06:30.571 --> 01:06:34.616
<i>Big clues right here, this scene.
Big clues as to who's what.</i>

1107
01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:37.536
Now I teach courses at Columbia Law
on genocide, slave labor...

1108
01:06:38.162 --> 01:06:40.414
<i>Right there. That's a big clue.</i>

1109
01:06:40.497 --> 01:06:43.167
- ...sue anybody when this is over?
- Oh, sure. Go nuts.

1110
01:06:43.250 --> 01:06:45.002
Go meshuga.

1111
01:06:47.546 --> 01:06:49.715
Now that's a good looking shithole.

1112
01:06:59.808 --> 01:07:01.393
- Hello?
- Hey, baby, how you doing?

1113
01:07:01.476 --> 01:07:03.437
Baby, I'm worried about you.
You coming home?

1114
01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:05.189
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Soon.

1115
01:07:05.272 --> 01:07:07.858
It's gonna be a long night, though,
so don't wait up for me.

1116
01:07:07.941 --> 01:07:09.109
Why don't you let me come down there?

1117
01:07:09.193 --> 01:07:11.987
Because I don't want to be
distracted by you, that's why.

1118
01:07:12.070 --> 01:07:15.032
Well, if you're still there when I come
on duty in the morning, you will see me.

1119
01:07:15.115 --> 01:07:18.744
- I cannot wait. I cannot wait.
- So, how you doing?

1120
01:07:18.827 --> 01:07:21.496
It's all right. We got a couple
of the hostages out. Thanks a lot.

1121
01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:25.042
- No, no. How you doing?
- I'm doing okay. I'm doing all right.

1122
01:07:25.125 --> 01:07:28.837
Oh, I saw the Mayor on TV. He said
you're doing a great job. I saw you, too.

1123
01:07:28.962 --> 01:07:30.464
- You saw me on TV?
- Yeah.

1124
01:07:30.547 --> 01:07:33.091
- How'd I look?
- You looked good, baby. Real good.

1125
01:07:33.175 --> 01:07:36.220
- All right, listen. I got to go.
- All right. Hey.

1126
01:07:36.303 --> 01:07:38.931
- Keep your head down.
- All right, I will. Love you.

1127
01:07:40.098 --> 01:07:41.433
Come on.

1128
01:07:44.686 --> 01:07:47.814
So, are we clear about the ground rules?

1129
01:07:47.898 --> 01:07:50.567
- There's no need to worry, Detective.
- I get paid to worry, okay?

1130
01:07:50.651 --> 01:07:51.902
I just need you to look me in the eye

1131
01:07:51.985 --> 01:07:54.196
and make me believe that you understand
everything we talked about.

1132
01:07:55.989 --> 01:07:57.449
- I understand.
- Okay.

1133
01:07:57.532 --> 01:07:59.451
<i>Here's another way where we could</i>

1134
01:07:59.534 --> 01:08:03.163
<i>still make you see that
we are in the post-9/11 world</i>

1135
01:08:03.247 --> 01:08:07.042
<i>with that mural behind
Jodie Foster and Denzel Washington.</i>

1136
01:08:07.501 --> 01:08:09.002
- Hello?
- Who is this?

1137
01:08:09.086 --> 01:08:10.921
Let's not get into any names.

1138
01:08:11.046 --> 01:08:13.715
- What matters is what I can offer you.
- And what's that?

1139
01:08:13.799 --> 01:08:16.343
Well, if I can be assured
that certain interests are protected,

1140
01:08:16.426 --> 01:08:18.262
I might be able to help you get
what you came for.

1141
01:08:18.345 --> 01:08:20.013
I doubt that.

1142
01:08:20.847 --> 01:08:23.934
Tell me about these interests
that you are trying to protect.

1143
01:08:24.184 --> 01:08:25.602
Why don't you let me worry about that?

1144
01:08:25.686 --> 01:08:29.398
Now, what is it you were hoping to get out
of all this?

1145
01:08:29.481 --> 01:08:31.692
- Rich, of course.
- Of course.

1146
01:08:31.775 --> 01:08:33.777
But you may have bitten off
more than you can chew.

1147
01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:36.905
- How?
- I can't discuss that on the phone.

1148
01:08:37.155 --> 01:08:39.366
- You work for the bank?
- No.

1149
01:08:39.866 --> 01:08:41.576
And you're not a cop.

1150
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:43.495
That's right.

1151
01:08:44.997 --> 01:08:46.540
Come on in.

1152
01:08:53.588 --> 01:08:55.132
You got 10 minutes. No more.

1153
01:08:55.215 --> 01:08:56.758
If you're not out
before the lights come back on,

1154
01:08:56.842 --> 01:08:58.552
you can stay inside until this thing is over.

1155
01:08:58.635 --> 01:09:00.971
- You don't need to threaten me.
- That's not a threat, lady, but this is.

1156
01:09:01.054 --> 01:09:03.473
I know this game is a mile over my head,
but I'm telling you, if you fuck me over...

1157
01:09:03.557 --> 01:09:06.643
I got where I am by collecting friends,
not enemies.

1158
01:09:06.810 --> 01:09:08.937
Trust me, okay?

1159
01:09:09.021 --> 01:09:10.897
You're on your own.

1160
01:09:23.535 --> 01:09:25.537
<i>Love this shot right here.</i>

1161
01:09:26.913 --> 01:09:31.168
<i>Jodie laying down being frisked.</i>

1162
01:09:31.251 --> 01:09:33.754
<i>Cameras high up in the ceiling.</i>

1163
01:09:34.087 --> 01:09:37.924
<i>And we crane down slowly</i>

1164
01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:44.139
<i>as she walks towards Clive Owen
at the bank tellers.</i>

1165
01:09:46.683 --> 01:09:50.437
<i>Respond with the opposite crane down</i>

1166
01:09:51.646 --> 01:09:55.525
<i>with Jodie facing camera.</i>

1167
01:09:59.321 --> 01:10:02.824
<i>This was a long, long, long,
long, long night.</i>

1168
01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:05.494
- It's not good enough.
- Well, I wasn't finished.

1169
01:10:05.952 --> 01:10:08.372
When you get out, you'll have $2 million.

1170
01:10:08.538 --> 01:10:15.212
<i>Dialog was twice as long
and we just cut a lot of it out</i>

1171
01:10:15.295 --> 01:10:18.548
<i>and we cut even some more out
during the editing.</i>

1172
01:10:18.632 --> 01:10:22.135
Oh, come on. I made you such a sweet offer.

1173
01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:24.638
I really don't think you have much
in the way of alternatives.

1174
01:10:24.721 --> 01:10:28.141
Why don't you talk to me about these
interests that you're in here to protect?

1175
01:10:28.225 --> 01:10:32.396
<i>I like these profile shots
that are cut back to back.</i>

1176
01:10:34.815 --> 01:10:38.985
During World War II, there was an American
working for a bank in Switzerland.

1177
01:10:39.486 --> 01:10:41.780
<i>There goes our signature shot, right there.</i>

1178
01:10:41.863 --> 01:10:42.864
...that this period in history

1179
01:10:42.948 --> 01:10:46.201
was rife with opportunity
for people of low morals.

1180
01:10:46.284 --> 01:10:47.327
People like this man.

1181
01:10:48.370 --> 01:10:52.582
He used his position with the Nazis
to enrich himself while all around him

1182
01:10:52.666 --> 01:10:55.502
people were being stripped
of everything they owned.

1183
01:10:56.086 --> 01:11:00.966
Then he used his blood money
to start a bank.

1184
01:11:01.049 --> 01:11:02.467
Now,

1185
01:11:03.885 --> 01:11:06.972
does this sound like
it might be the man you work for?

1186
01:11:07.472 --> 01:11:10.559
Or am I just whistling <i>Dixie</i> out of my ass?

1187
01:11:10.642 --> 01:11:13.395
- I believe we understand each other.
- Good.

1188
01:11:14.521 --> 01:11:16.189
So, what the hell can you do for me

1189
01:11:16.273 --> 01:11:20.402
since I clearly know more than you do,
and I've planned this to perfection?

1190
01:11:20.527 --> 01:11:24.906
Believe me, if I need to,
I can change your entire program.

1191
01:11:24.990 --> 01:11:26.616
So, the sooner
that you stop being my problem

1192
01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:30.787
and you start becoming my solution,
the better off you'll be.

1193
01:11:30.871 --> 01:11:33.123
- What is it you want?
- Two minutes.

1194
01:11:33.248 --> 01:11:35.876
The safety deposit box room.
I just need to go to one box.

1195
01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:40.755
<i>Silhouette.</i>

1196
01:11:41.381 --> 01:11:42.883
This could be very embarrassing
to your employer.

1197
01:11:44.301 --> 01:11:45.510
<i>The swastika.</i>

1198
01:11:45.594 --> 01:11:46.803
He should have destroyed this
a long time ago.

1199
01:11:46.887 --> 01:11:49.181
He didn't, so now it's mine.

1200
01:11:51.308 --> 01:11:54.394
Now, if the day ever comes
where I have to stand before a judge...

1201
01:11:54.811 --> 01:11:58.815
<i>Now, that's what Alfred Hitchcock
referred to as McGuffin.</i>

1202
01:11:59.691 --> 01:12:02.777
<i>We don't really show what is
in that envelope.</i>

1203
01:12:03.487 --> 01:12:07.324
<i>But, with the swastika...</i>

1204
01:12:08.617 --> 01:12:13.121
<i>With the swastika stamped on the top of it,
you know it can't be good.</i>

1205
01:12:16.291 --> 01:12:20.504
<i>All this Nazi stuff was really worked on more</i>

1206
01:12:21.213 --> 01:12:23.673
<i>during the script we built up.</i>

1207
01:12:23.757 --> 01:12:28.178
<i>The great writer/director Terry George has
brought in, added some stuff to the script.</i>

1208
01:12:29.471 --> 01:12:31.598
Really?

1209
01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:33.934
Good.

1210
01:12:37.437 --> 01:12:38.605
So, we spoke.

1211
01:12:38.688 --> 01:12:40.190
Oh, no. You're gonna have to give me
more than that.

1212
01:12:40.273 --> 01:12:42.025
- Let me have this window, fellows.
- Yes, sir.

1213
01:12:42.108 --> 01:12:44.736
I told him that, well,
since he hadn't killed anyone,

1214
01:12:44.819 --> 01:12:47.906
it wasn't too late to surrender
and get off with a lighter sentence.

1215
01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:49.533
And?

1216
01:12:49.950 --> 01:12:56.498
<i>This is the first of two key scenes
with Jodie and Denzel</i>

1217
01:12:57.082 --> 01:13:00.794
<i>where they're one-takes,
where they just talk,</i>

1218
01:13:00.877 --> 01:13:05.048
<i>no cutting, and we are just dollying slowly</i>

1219
01:13:05.131 --> 01:13:08.468
<i>and let these two great actors just work.</i>

1220
01:13:10.303 --> 01:13:12.514
<i>Don't get in the way.</i>

1221
01:13:12.597 --> 01:13:16.393
<i>Just pushing slowly, let them do their thing.</i>

1222
01:13:17.352 --> 01:13:19.813
<i>Oh, fuck...</i>

1223
01:13:20.146 --> 01:13:23.984
<i>Universal Pictures, when they looked
at the dailies, I got the word back.</i>

1224
01:13:24.067 --> 01:13:26.778
<i>They said,</i> "<i>So, Spike...</i>"
<i>I mean, they didn't say it to me but,</i>

1225
01:13:26.861 --> 01:13:29.906
"<i>Is there going</i>
<i>to be any coverage on this scene?"</i>

1226
01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:31.741
<i>I said,</i> "<i>Hell, no, there's no coverage.</i>

1227
01:13:31.825 --> 01:13:35.704
"<i>This is the motherfucking shot.</i>
<i>We don't need coverage.</i>"

1228
01:13:35.787 --> 01:13:37.789
<i>I didn't tell</i> '<i>em that,</i>
<i>but that's what I was thinking, though.</i>

1229
01:13:42.586 --> 01:13:47.340
<i>Why do you need coverage on this?
It's one-shot.</i>

1230
01:13:47.424 --> 01:13:51.761
<i>I don't understand that stuff. How are
these people, they're gonna tell directors,</i>

1231
01:13:51.845 --> 01:13:55.932
<i>you know,</i> "<i>You need stuff like that"?</i>
<i>They don't know anything about it.</i>

1232
01:13:56.016 --> 01:13:57.434
Most of the guys up in Sing Sing

1233
01:13:57.517 --> 01:13:59.102
weren't murderers
until they killed somebody.

1234
01:13:59.185 --> 01:14:01.938
You never know what a person will do
until you push him into a corner.

1235
01:14:03.690 --> 01:14:05.942
But it doesn't seem
like you've pushed him into a corner.

1236
01:14:06.026 --> 01:14:09.529
It doesn't, does it?
Seems more like he chose the corner.

1237
01:14:11.197 --> 01:14:12.699
You're right.

1238
01:14:13.366 --> 01:14:15.327
So, you through?

1239
01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:18.163
- I guess. Are you saying I'm dismissed?
- Yes, I am.

1240
01:14:18.246 --> 01:14:21.207
You got a card, in case I need to call you?

1241
01:14:21.499 --> 01:14:24.377
Please don't take this personally, but no.

1242
01:14:24.836 --> 01:14:25.962
I don't think you can afford me.

1243
01:14:26.046 --> 01:14:29.257
Well, don't take this personally, Miss White.
Kiss my black ass, okay?

1244
01:14:30.383 --> 01:14:31.926
Careful, Detective Frazier...

1245
01:14:32.552 --> 01:14:34.095
<i>That's another thing the studio didn't like.</i>

1246
01:14:34.179 --> 01:14:37.724
"<i>Should we have Denzel saying</i>
'<i>Kiss my black ass'?</i>

1247
01:14:38.933 --> 01:14:40.560
"<i>We don't know if Denzel should say that.</i>"

1248
01:14:40.644 --> 01:14:42.646
<i>Why not?</i>

1249
01:14:42.729 --> 01:14:45.482
<i>Jodie had the line for it, too.</i>

1250
01:14:45.565 --> 01:14:48.234
<i>My bite is worse than my bark.</i>

1251
01:14:48.693 --> 01:14:51.321
- No? Not at all, huh?
- Nope. I'm from Brooklyn.

1252
01:14:51.404 --> 01:14:52.572
You're from Brooklyn, huh? I understand.

1253
01:14:52.656 --> 01:14:54.449
- Guns don't scare me.
- They don't scare you?

1254
01:14:54.532 --> 01:14:56.284
- Brave, too, huh?
- Yeah.

1255
01:14:56.368 --> 01:14:59.496
So the guys that had the guns,
do you remember them saying anything?

1256
01:14:59.954 --> 01:15:02.165
- Yeah.
- What'd they say?

1257
01:15:02.248 --> 01:15:03.500
They asked me about my game.

1258
01:15:03.583 --> 01:15:06.252
- Who did?
- The guy that robbed the bank. Duh.

1259
01:15:06.878 --> 01:15:08.755
Son, be respectful.

1260
01:15:08.838 --> 01:15:10.965
Okay, Brooklyn.
But it... Was he the one in charge?

1261
01:15:11.174 --> 01:15:12.258
Okay.

1262
01:15:12.926 --> 01:15:15.679
And you don't remember anything else?

1263
01:15:15.762 --> 01:15:17.597
He was kind of tall.

1264
01:15:17.681 --> 01:15:18.807
He had a mask.

1265
01:15:18.890 --> 01:15:20.517
<i>Again, this is the young man</i>

1266
01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:25.230
<i>who was playing the video game
in the vault with Clive.</i>

1267
01:15:25.313 --> 01:15:27.857
<i>His name is Amir Said.</i>

1268
01:15:28.775 --> 01:15:30.568
...just take a look.

1269
01:15:35.490 --> 01:15:41.371
<i>I saw Amir, he was in this skit</i>
<i>in one of those</i> Dave Chappelle Shows.

1270
01:15:41.454 --> 01:15:44.165
With the mask, they all look the same.
That's right, Brian.

1271
01:15:45.083 --> 01:15:47.335
<i>My main man, Lemon.</i>

1272
01:15:47.419 --> 01:15:51.005
<i>As I said before, one of the original</i>
<i>members of the</i> Def Poetry Jam.

1273
01:15:52.215 --> 01:15:53.925
I got to hand it to you, Pablo.

1274
01:15:54.008 --> 01:15:56.594
First of all, it's Paul. Not Pablo...

1275
01:16:00.014 --> 01:16:01.891
<i>Puerto Rico.</i>

1276
01:16:02.809 --> 01:16:04.269
And second, I didn't do it, all right?

1277
01:16:04.352 --> 01:16:07.063
What? I made a few mistakes
when I was a kid.

1278
01:16:07.147 --> 01:16:09.482
I was out with some friends
and they held up a liquor store.

1279
01:16:11.484 --> 01:16:12.819
What was I supposed to do?

1280
01:16:15.321 --> 01:16:16.823
Where'd you grow up, you Wassa Wassa,
Park Avenue?

1281
01:16:16.906 --> 01:16:19.617
<i>He improvised that line,</i> "<i>Wassa Wassa.</i>"

1282
01:16:21.703 --> 01:16:23.329
You know, a person
that don't come to your neighborhood.

1283
01:16:23.455 --> 01:16:24.748
How do you say "Rikers Island"...

1284
01:16:24.831 --> 01:16:26.708
<i>Denzel had an answer, too.</i>

1285
01:16:26.791 --> 01:16:28.960
<i>How do you spell</i> "<i>Rikers Island"?</i>

1286
01:16:29.419 --> 01:16:31.880
These two? No.

1287
01:16:31.963 --> 01:16:33.047
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

1288
01:16:33.131 --> 01:16:34.257
Don't they look suspicious to you?

1289
01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:36.760
I mean, I would think that you would
want to know who they are.

1290
01:16:38.261 --> 01:16:39.262
No.

1291
01:16:39.345 --> 01:16:41.055
- Well, thank you very much.
- Thank you.

1292
01:16:41.139 --> 01:16:43.767
Hey, just out of curiosity
do you know anything about diamonds?

1293
01:16:43.850 --> 01:16:46.019
A bit. What do you need?

1294
01:16:46.102 --> 01:16:48.271
What do you think a guy like me
should pay for a diamond ring?

1295
01:16:48.354 --> 01:16:49.773
Depends. How many karats?

1296
01:16:49.856 --> 01:16:52.108
If you'd like, I could give you
my nephew's number.

1297
01:16:52.192 --> 01:16:53.777
- Okay.
- You'll get a very good deal.

1298
01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:56.196
What do you have on underneath?

1299
01:16:56.362 --> 01:16:58.448
- Excuse me?
- Underneath your painter's coat?

1300
01:16:58.531 --> 01:17:00.700
- What do you have on underneath?
- Clothing.

1301
01:17:00.784 --> 01:17:02.577
Could you show us, please?

1302
01:17:04.078 --> 01:17:06.039
<i>Miss Director.</i>

1303
01:17:07.415 --> 01:17:09.042
You see, there's just you
and one other woman

1304
01:17:09.125 --> 01:17:11.878
that fit the physical description
of the female suspect.

1305
01:17:11.961 --> 01:17:13.838
What's that?

1306
01:17:14.839 --> 01:17:17.842
It's your height, your age, and your...

1307
01:17:18.885 --> 01:17:20.011
Your cup size.

1308
01:17:20.094 --> 01:17:23.723
So, I violated Section 34 double-D?

1309
01:17:23.890 --> 01:17:26.100
That's what you're telling me?

1310
01:17:29.312 --> 01:17:32.398
How dumb do these morons have to be
to think they're gonna get a plane?

1311
01:17:32.482 --> 01:17:33.733
This guy's no moron.

1312
01:17:33.817 --> 01:17:36.653
I don't just mean him. Any hostage taker.

1313
01:17:38.071 --> 01:17:39.656
Those ragheads at the Munich Olympics.

1314
01:17:39.739 --> 01:17:43.243
<i>Ragheads, towelheads,</i>

1315
01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:46.579
<i>sand niggers.</i>

1316
01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:49.374
<i>That's what they call them.</i>

1317
01:17:49.833 --> 01:17:51.543
<i>You know why we wanted that?
That's the way people speak.</i>

1318
01:17:51.626 --> 01:17:54.170
<i>You should put it in there.</i>

1319
01:17:54.254 --> 01:17:56.923
<i>Not just the way they speak,
the way they think of Arabs</i>

1320
01:17:57.257 --> 01:17:59.592
<i>or Sikhs.</i>

1321
01:18:02.554 --> 01:18:06.057
This whole time,
we're trying to stall him, right?

1322
01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:07.976
Wrong. They're the ones that are stalling.

1323
01:18:08.142 --> 01:18:10.270
Think about it.
The bullshit questions, the Albanian thing...

1324
01:18:10.353 --> 01:18:11.479
So, you're saying he what?

1325
01:18:11.563 --> 01:18:15.817
I'm saying that he wants
to give us more time. He makes demands.

1326
01:18:15.984 --> 01:18:18.945
He gives us deadlines. We stall.
Then he gives us more time.

1327
01:18:19.571 --> 01:18:20.572
I don't think he's in a rush.

1328
01:18:20.655 --> 01:18:22.782
- Why?
- That's what I'm gonna find out.

1329
01:18:39.799 --> 01:18:44.762
<i>In the cast, we needed someone
really strong to play opposite Denzel.</i>

1330
01:18:44.846 --> 01:18:47.682
<i>Someone who had some weight,</i>

1331
01:18:48.474 --> 01:18:53.730
<i>who would dig their feet in the ground
and not just be pushed over</i>

1332
01:18:53.813 --> 01:18:58.234
<i>by the power of a Denzel Washington.</i>

1333
01:18:58.318 --> 01:19:00.945
<i>And Clive was that man.</i>

1334
01:19:01.029 --> 01:19:03.239
<i>I mean, Clive's a man, you know.</i>

1335
01:19:03.323 --> 01:19:06.242
<i>You could tell that right away, he is a man.</i>

1336
01:19:06.326 --> 01:19:08.745
<i>And, of course, he had deep respect
for Denzel,</i>

1337
01:19:08.828 --> 01:19:12.373
<i>but he wasn't going to get run over, either.</i>

1338
01:19:12.457 --> 01:19:14.876
<i>And that's what we needed for the film.</i>

1339
01:19:14.959 --> 01:19:19.172
<i>You know, it was key that we not cast
some roody-poop, some ope-doke</i>

1340
01:19:19.255 --> 01:19:22.717
<i>that Denzel could just bulldoze over.</i>

1341
01:19:23.593 --> 01:19:24.636
<i>That's not good for the film.</i>

1342
01:19:24.719 --> 01:19:28.640
<i>We need to have someone
just as smart and strong as he is.</i>

1343
01:19:28.723 --> 01:19:33.353
<i>So this cat and mouse game...
So he could play that part.</i>

1344
01:19:33.436 --> 01:19:35.188
<i>It's like sports.</i>

1345
01:19:35.271 --> 01:19:36.439
<i>How you gonna have a rivalry</i>

1346
01:19:36.522 --> 01:19:38.524
<i>when one team is killing
the other team all the time?</i>

1347
01:19:38.608 --> 01:19:41.527
<i>You know, it's when two teams
are evenly matched,</i>

1348
01:19:41.611 --> 01:19:45.031
<i>that's what makes a rivalry a real rivalry.</i>

1349
01:20:01.965 --> 01:20:03.716
Down the stairs.

1350
01:20:04.217 --> 01:20:07.845
<i>So again that scene upfront,
that was a real bank location.</i>

1351
01:20:07.929 --> 01:20:11.224
<i>Now, they are coming down the steps.
This is the bank set.</i>

1352
01:20:11.307 --> 01:20:13.309
- Gum?
- Excuse me?

1353
01:20:13.393 --> 01:20:16.229
- Would you like some gum?
- No, thank you.

1354
01:20:20.942 --> 01:20:24.862
<i>All this is the fine Steadicam work
of Steve Consentino.</i>

1355
01:20:25.571 --> 01:20:29.742
<i>Again, Matthew Libatique,
the director of cinematography.</i>

1356
01:20:40.378 --> 01:20:42.422
<i>The origin of the script is this.</i>

1357
01:20:42.505 --> 01:20:46.342
<i>Russell is a first-time screenwriter.</i>

1358
01:20:46.426 --> 01:20:50.471
<i>And the script was sold to Imagine.</i>

1359
01:20:50.555 --> 01:20:55.852
<i>Imagine being co-founded
and owned by Brian Grazer</i>

1360
01:20:56.436 --> 01:20:59.689
<i>and very fine director Ron Howard.</i>

1361
01:21:00.023 --> 01:21:04.444
<i>They bought it with the intention
of Ron Howard to direct this film.</i>

1362
01:21:04.610 --> 01:21:08.573
<i>That was the intention. In fact,
he was working with Russell on this script</i>

1363
01:21:08.740 --> 01:21:11.868
<i>when sometime during that process</i>

1364
01:21:11.951 --> 01:21:18.541
<i>Russell Crowe approached Ron and said,</i>
"<i>Let's do</i> Cinderella Man <i>instead.</i>"

1365
01:21:18.624 --> 01:21:21.753
<i>They had won Academy Awards,</i>

1366
01:21:21.836 --> 01:21:25.131
<i>honors in box-office</i>
<i>for their film</i> A Beautiful Mind.

1367
01:21:25.506 --> 01:21:31.929
<i>So, Ron Howard left</i> Inside Man
<i>to do</i> Cinderella Man.

1368
01:21:32.805 --> 01:21:37.560
<i>And several other directors were brought in,</i>

1369
01:21:37.643 --> 01:21:39.395
<i>re-wrote the script and whatnot.</i>

1370
01:21:39.479 --> 01:21:43.066
<i>But, they could not attract talent.</i>

1371
01:21:43.149 --> 01:21:46.444
<i>The way films get made today,
in Hollywood today, is this.</i>

1372
01:21:46.527 --> 01:21:49.322
<i>You know, a lot of stuff is cast pending,</i>

1373
01:21:49.405 --> 01:21:54.327
<i>which means that they give you
a list of Hollywood stars,</i>

1374
01:21:54.494 --> 01:21:56.245
<i>stars who are box-office.</i>

1375
01:21:56.329 --> 01:21:59.082
<i>By box-office, I mean
that when a film opens,</i>

1376
01:21:59.165 --> 01:22:01.918
<i>the opening weekend,
people are gonna come to the theaters</i>

1377
01:22:02.001 --> 01:22:08.216
<i>based solely on that actor's name,
no matter what film they are in.</i>

1378
01:22:08.299 --> 01:22:13.805
<i>So, luckily for us Denzel, you know,
was on that list.</i>

1379
01:22:13.888 --> 01:22:18.851
<i>The script was slipped to me
on the down low.</i>

1380
01:22:18.935 --> 01:22:22.063
<i>On the down low means
somebody gave it to me</i>

1381
01:22:22.146 --> 01:22:25.233
<i>and I read it, I liked it.</i>

1382
01:22:25.316 --> 01:22:28.903
<i>Had a meeting with Brian Grazer
about another project</i>

1383
01:22:29.195 --> 01:22:35.535
<i>and as the meeting was about to end</i>
<i>I told Brian that I had read</i> Inside Man

1384
01:22:36.536 --> 01:22:39.789
<i>and I would like to do it.</i>

1385
01:22:39.872 --> 01:22:41.374
<i>Brian was taken aback by it.</i>

1386
01:22:41.457 --> 01:22:45.461
<i>First of all, he never knew I'd
even known the existence of the script.</i>

1387
01:22:45.545 --> 01:22:50.800
<i>And he was pleasantly surprised
but still had a little apprehension,</i>

1388
01:22:52.135 --> 01:22:57.932
<i>Brian Grazer being one of the most
successful producers in Hollywood today.</i>

1389
01:22:58.015 --> 01:23:00.685
<i>You know, he respects
my filmmaking abilities</i>

1390
01:23:00.768 --> 01:23:03.521
<i>but he didn't know
if we could work together,</i>

1391
01:23:03.604 --> 01:23:07.233
<i>by meaning that we're both very strong,
very opinionated,</i>

1392
01:23:07.316 --> 01:23:09.986
<i>so he didn't know if we could work together.</i>

1393
01:23:10.069 --> 01:23:15.408
<i>And as Brian walked me to the elevator
in their office building</i>

1394
01:23:15.491 --> 01:23:19.787
<i>I told Brian that</i> "<i>Look,</i>
<i>you shouldn't worry about anything.</i>

1395
01:23:19.871 --> 01:23:23.791
"<i>You and I will be able to coexist,</i>
<i>get this film made,</i>

1396
01:23:23.875 --> 01:23:26.127
"<i>it's gonna turn out good.</i>"

1397
01:23:26.377 --> 01:23:31.507
<i>And we shook hands,
I pressed the elevator button,</i>

1398
01:23:31.591 --> 01:23:35.303
<i>elevator came and I got in and that was it.</i>

1399
01:23:35.386 --> 01:23:39.765
<i>And then that's when I sent the script
to Denzel.</i>

1400
01:23:39.849 --> 01:23:41.684
<i>He came in.</i>

1401
01:23:41.767 --> 01:23:48.024
<i>And the film was put on the fast track,
right away.</i>

1402
01:23:48.107 --> 01:23:50.860
<i>So, we had to cast around Denzel.</i>

1403
01:23:50.943 --> 01:23:54.155
<i>Next was Clive, next was Jodie,</i>

1404
01:23:54.238 --> 01:24:00.036
<i>Christopher Plummer,
Chiwetel, Willem Dafoe.</i>

1405
01:24:00.119 --> 01:24:03.748
<i>As I said before, Denzel had a window
that was open,</i>

1406
01:24:03.831 --> 01:24:06.667
<i>and that if we could shoot this film
or shoot him out...</i>

1407
01:24:06.751 --> 01:24:10.463
<i>What I mean is get rid of all his scenes first.</i>

1408
01:24:10.546 --> 01:24:12.840
<i>Because he had an out date,
he had to be out by a specific date.</i>

1409
01:24:12.924 --> 01:24:17.511
<i>So we had to finish all of Denzel's scenes
before that date.</i>

1410
01:24:17.595 --> 01:24:22.058
<i>And that's what we did.
It took 39 days to shoot this film.</i>

1411
01:24:22.141 --> 01:24:24.769
<i>And a budget a little under $50 million.</i>

1412
01:24:24.852 --> 01:24:26.395
<i>And when you look at it,
I think Universal Pictures</i>

1413
01:24:26.479 --> 01:24:29.023
<i>got a kind of bargain.</i>

1414
01:24:29.106 --> 01:24:35.780
<i>Denzel, Clive Owen, Jodie Foster,
Willem Dafoe, Christopher Plummer,</i>

1415
01:24:36.530 --> 01:24:41.494
<i>Chiwetel and myself
in New York City on location,</i>

1416
01:24:41.577 --> 01:24:45.498
<i>not Toronto, on location in New York,</i>

1417
01:24:45.581 --> 01:24:49.126
<i>39 days, under 50.</i>

1418
01:24:49.210 --> 01:24:51.963
<i>Basement bargain.</i>

1419
01:24:52.046 --> 01:24:55.174
<i>It's gonna cost them next time, though.</i>

1420
01:25:00.096 --> 01:25:05.601
<i>In actuality, this is the sixth film I have done
for Universal Pictures.</i>

1421
01:25:05.685 --> 01:25:08.104
<i>This is number six for Universal.</i>

1422
01:25:08.187 --> 01:25:10.690
<i>Let's count.</i>

1423
01:25:10.815 --> 01:25:13.484
<i>Let me see, so we got</i> Do the Right Thing,

1424
01:25:14.402 --> 01:25:16.279
Mo' Better,

1425
01:25:16.362 --> 01:25:18.948
Jungle Fever,

1426
01:25:19.031 --> 01:25:21.409
Crooklyn,

1427
01:25:21.492 --> 01:25:24.495
Clockers <i>and</i> Inside Man. <i>That's the sixth.</i>

1428
01:25:24.578 --> 01:25:26.205
I gave him every excuse
to blow my brains out.

1429
01:25:26.289 --> 01:25:27.290
Yeah.

1430
01:25:27.373 --> 01:25:30.793
He doesn't bite. Why? He ain't the type.

1431
01:25:30.876 --> 01:25:33.379
Let's just step back
and think about this for a second.

1432
01:25:33.462 --> 01:25:36.882
We know that they planned this whole thing.
The tape, the cameras, the costumes.

1433
01:25:37.008 --> 01:25:39.218
There was a game plan,
but it never included airplanes.

1434
01:25:39.302 --> 01:25:42.680
He's up to something but it ain't violence.

1435
01:25:46.142 --> 01:25:48.561
- I'm listening.
- How's the reception?

1436
01:25:49.103 --> 01:25:51.605
- Excuse me?
- The camera on the truck.

1437
01:25:51.981 --> 01:25:54.859
Give me a close-up
on the second-floor window.

1438
01:25:55.109 --> 01:25:56.902
- Rourke?
- I'm on it, I'm on it.

1439
01:26:06.078 --> 01:26:08.622
<i>Now wait a minute,
let's see the guy get shot in the head.</i>

1440
01:26:11.792 --> 01:26:15.463
<i>Now comes the signature shot right here.</i>

1441
01:26:16.589 --> 01:26:19.425
<i>Denzel on the Dolly. Right here.</i>

1442
01:26:25.431 --> 01:26:27.224
What are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?

1443
01:26:27.308 --> 01:26:28.851
You mean beyond the obvious?

1444
01:26:28.934 --> 01:26:31.270
<i>I like this scene, this big confrontation
scene between the two.</i>

1445
01:26:31.354 --> 01:26:32.730
...this ain't no bank robbery!

1446
01:26:32.813 --> 01:26:35.358
This is your fault.
I told you to get the buses.

1447
01:26:35.441 --> 01:26:38.903
Fuck you! I didn't kill anybody.

1448
01:26:41.113 --> 01:26:43.699
I got 50 more people in here.
You fuck with me again,

1449
01:26:43.783 --> 01:26:45.951
I'll give you two
of the longest days of your life.

1450
01:26:46.035 --> 01:26:49.997
All right, look, just tell me what
it is you really want and I'll get it for you.

1451
01:26:50.081 --> 01:26:53.042
- I promise.
- I've told you. Two buses, a plane.

1452
01:26:53.125 --> 01:26:55.836
Right, right. And box seats
behind home plate at Yankee Stadium.

1453
01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:57.963
Come on, don't bullshit a bullshitter.

1454
01:26:59.173 --> 01:27:01.258
You planned every inch of this thing
right from the start.

1455
01:27:01.342 --> 01:27:05.346
You got everybody marching to your beat,
including me, and I'm through buying it.

1456
01:27:08.641 --> 01:27:10.810
You're too damn smart to be a cop.

1457
01:27:10.893 --> 01:27:12.520
Now get the fuck out of here.

1458
01:27:12.603 --> 01:27:13.687
What? You going to shoot me?

1459
01:27:13.771 --> 01:27:15.147
"<i>You going to shoot me?"</i>

1460
01:27:15.231 --> 01:27:16.482
Do it. Shit, you got nothing to lose.

1461
01:27:16.565 --> 01:27:18.067
I damn sure ain't got nothing to lose,
so shoot me.

1462
01:27:18.150 --> 01:27:20.778
<i>He shows New York right here,</i> "<i>Shoot me.</i>

1463
01:27:20.861 --> 01:27:22.071
"<i>Do it.</i>"

1464
01:27:22.154 --> 01:27:23.739
Fuck you.

1465
01:27:23.823 --> 01:27:26.325
Tell them to send someone sane over here.

1466
01:27:36.460 --> 01:27:38.754
<i>Now this next shot right here.</i>

1467
01:27:43.134 --> 01:27:45.136
<i>There, walks away.</i>

1468
01:27:45.219 --> 01:27:47.972
<i>Then you see the, yes, you guys,</i>

1469
01:27:48.055 --> 01:27:52.643
<i>reflection slightly fade into black.</i>

1470
01:27:55.271 --> 01:27:56.730
We got a big problem.

1471
01:27:56.814 --> 01:27:59.066
Hey, Detective, this ain't your day.

1472
01:28:02.903 --> 01:28:05.364
<i>Denzel's commander, right here.</i>

1473
01:28:05.448 --> 01:28:07.116
<i>Peter Gerety, he's another actor we got</i>

1474
01:28:07.199 --> 01:28:11.871
<i>from one of my favorite shows,</i> The Wire,
<i>which is on HBO.</i>

1475
01:28:12.204 --> 01:28:14.331
<i>He played a judge on that show.</i>

1476
01:28:14.415 --> 01:28:16.292
But if you're going down on this one,
I can't go with you.

1477
01:28:16.375 --> 01:28:17.751
You got to understand this, though, sir...

1478
01:28:17.835 --> 01:28:20.296
No, no, no. Let me just tell you
what my problem is, okay?

1479
01:28:20.379 --> 01:28:22.381
I go to bed, everything's hunky-dory.

1480
01:28:22.465 --> 01:28:24.925
I get a call at 3:15, and there's what?
A dead hostage.

1481
01:28:25.009 --> 01:28:27.386
- Right, right, right. But I can end this...
- It is ended.

1482
01:28:28.304 --> 01:28:30.139
See, you think I got options.

1483
01:28:30.222 --> 01:28:32.141
I got to answer to the Chief of D's.

1484
01:28:32.641 --> 01:28:35.394
Darius is calling the shots on this. That's it.

1485
01:28:50.326 --> 01:28:52.912
<i>Pizzicato bass, that's what they call it,</i>

1486
01:28:52.995 --> 01:28:54.705
<i>basically your fingers and not a bow.</i>

1487
01:28:54.788 --> 01:28:57.082
- What'd he say?
- That's it.

1488
01:28:57.583 --> 01:28:59.084
Shit.

1489
01:29:00.336 --> 01:29:02.963
- It's a tactical nightmare.
- I know.

1490
01:29:03.047 --> 01:29:06.217
Well, first, this is the only way in.

1491
01:29:06.300 --> 01:29:08.344
Then we got to make it up the stairs blind.

1492
01:29:08.427 --> 01:29:09.595
Once we get up there...

1493
01:29:09.678 --> 01:29:12.932
<i>This fantasy sequence is not scripted.</i>

1494
01:29:13.015 --> 01:29:15.684
<i>But I felt that it's a good time</i>

1495
01:29:15.768 --> 01:29:22.733
<i>to interject some action,
even though it's not really reality.</i>

1496
01:29:26.028 --> 01:29:30.241
<i>So, we shot this the last day
in the stage of the bank</i>

1497
01:29:30.324 --> 01:29:33.619
<i>so we could shoot it up.</i>

1498
01:29:33.786 --> 01:29:35.496
Open the door!

1499
01:29:42.211 --> 01:29:44.380
<i>Real-life shootout.</i>

1500
01:29:49.301 --> 01:29:51.136
- Keep moving.
- To the right.

1501
01:29:51.220 --> 01:29:52.930
Watch the hands, watch the hands.

1502
01:29:53.013 --> 01:29:55.224
And let's not forget the possibility
of hostages being killed.

1503
01:29:55.307 --> 01:29:56.976
Right now! Put the gun down!

1504
01:29:57.059 --> 01:29:58.811
Back off or I shoot! I said back off!

1505
01:29:59.812 --> 01:30:03.232
Well, our best hope is to separate them
from the hostages.

1506
01:30:03.649 --> 01:30:06.318
If we can get two or three upstairs
and take them out?

1507
01:30:06.402 --> 01:30:07.528
Kill them?

1508
01:30:14.076 --> 01:30:15.661
<i>I like this coming up.</i>

1509
01:30:18.581 --> 01:30:20.666
<i>Watch the money fly.</i>

1510
01:30:26.797 --> 01:30:27.881
What if there's more than four?

1511
01:30:27.965 --> 01:30:32.011
Yeah, well, that's what's so nuts about it.
Anybody in a painter's suit could be a perp.

1512
01:30:33.178 --> 01:30:35.681
Maybe we should dress our guys up
like a bunch of painters.

1513
01:30:37.516 --> 01:30:40.686
And we should use rubber bullets.
Take head shots. Put their lights out.

1514
01:30:42.896 --> 01:30:44.982
- Not a bad idea.
- Yeah.

1515
01:30:45.065 --> 01:30:46.859
Rubber bullets it is, baby.

1516
01:30:49.361 --> 01:30:53.157
<i>Transition shot to know that
another day is gone by.</i>

1517
01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:54.783
<i>It's the crack of dawn.</i>

1518
01:30:54.867 --> 01:30:56.994
...this whole mess in your lap, you know?

1519
01:30:57.411 --> 01:30:59.079
- I'm making First Grade.
- What?

1520
01:30:59.204 --> 01:31:02.541
I'm making Detective First Grade.
Things ain't all they appear to be.

1521
01:31:02.625 --> 01:31:06.378
- What the fuck does that mean?
- Detective First Grade Keith Frazier.

1522
01:31:06.503 --> 01:31:08.130
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Yes.

1523
01:31:08.213 --> 01:31:10.841
<i>See there's Marv Albert right there.</i>

1524
01:31:10.924 --> 01:31:14.303
"<i>Walt Frazier shoots, yes.</i>"

1525
01:31:15.346 --> 01:31:18.390
<i>Former long-time New York Knicks
announcer.</i>

1526
01:31:18.474 --> 01:31:20.059
...to let that happen.

1527
01:31:20.142 --> 01:31:21.810
Everybody's getting theirs.
I'm gonna get mine.

1528
01:31:24.647 --> 01:31:25.939
I'll be outside.

1529
01:31:31.570 --> 01:31:33.364
What a day, what a day.

1530
01:31:33.572 --> 01:31:35.741
<i>So, this is the set right here.</i>

1531
01:31:36.408 --> 01:31:40.287
<i>Steps outside, we are on location.</i>

1532
01:31:42.915 --> 01:31:47.252
<i>Again, actor Victor Colicchio.</i>

1533
01:31:47.336 --> 01:31:51.382
<i>As I said before, Michael Imperioli</i>
<i>and I co-wrote</i> Summer of Sam.

1534
01:31:51.757 --> 01:31:54.385
Do me a favor, Sergeant.
Just tone down the color commentary.

1535
01:31:57.262 --> 01:31:59.348
So I bust up the fight,

1536
01:31:59.431 --> 01:32:03.185
I turn around
and this kid is pointing a .22 at my chest.

1537
01:32:03.268 --> 01:32:06.980
- Is that right? Now, which kid was this?
- Another kid, an African-American.

1538
01:32:07.064 --> 01:32:08.899
- An African-American, right?
- Yeah.

1539
01:32:08.982 --> 01:32:10.567
Came out of nowhere. I didn't see him.

1540
01:32:10.651 --> 01:32:11.652
So, what'd you do?

1541
01:32:11.735 --> 01:32:13.862
What did I do then?
I'll tell you what I did then.

1542
01:32:13.946 --> 01:32:17.282
I got shot in the fucking chest.
That's what I did then.

1543
01:32:17.366 --> 01:32:19.576
Yeah, so you'll pardon
my euphemisms, Detective,

1544
01:32:19.660 --> 01:32:23.414
but I would rather wind up an old bigot
than a handsome young corpse.

1545
01:32:23.497 --> 01:32:25.040
Now, no offense, Detective,

1546
01:32:25.124 --> 01:32:27.793
but I'm just trying
to keep them away from us.

1547
01:32:27.876 --> 01:32:30.963
Now, what do you say we just
get these people safely out of the bank?

1548
01:32:31.046 --> 01:32:32.089
I hear that.

1549
01:32:32.172 --> 01:32:35.551
And I'll try and watch
what I say in the future.

1550
01:32:35.634 --> 01:32:37.261
You never know who's listening.

1551
01:32:39.096 --> 01:32:41.014
<i>Now I made him think.</i>

1552
01:32:51.942 --> 01:32:53.277
What are you doing?

1553
01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:55.320
Jesus. Shit.

1554
01:32:55.404 --> 01:32:57.489
They bugged us.

1555
01:32:57.573 --> 01:32:59.158
They bugged us.

1556
01:33:02.661 --> 01:33:04.288
Darius!

1557
01:33:04.371 --> 01:33:06.331
Darius, don't make a move!

1558
01:33:06.415 --> 01:33:08.083
- What?
- It's all fucked up!

1559
01:33:08.167 --> 01:33:10.419
Do not make a move! Keep your men back!

1560
01:33:10.502 --> 01:33:11.545
What are you talking about?

1561
01:33:11.628 --> 01:33:13.464
They heard everything we said in the M.C.C.

1562
01:33:13.547 --> 01:33:15.674
- What?
- Stand down! Stand down!

1563
01:33:15.758 --> 01:33:19.011
The drawer with the demands in it!
They heard everything we said!

1564
01:33:19.094 --> 01:33:21.388
They put a transmitter in it!
They bugged us!

1565
01:33:21.472 --> 01:33:24.016
No, no, no. I'm going in.

1566
01:33:25.267 --> 01:33:26.268
Shit.

1567
01:33:34.485 --> 01:33:35.819
Get everyone together.

1568
01:33:35.903 --> 01:33:38.071
<i>Smoke bombs.</i>

1569
01:33:41.366 --> 01:33:42.951
They're coming in.

1570
01:33:43.035 --> 01:33:44.870
- Everybody good?
- Yeah.

1571
01:33:44.953 --> 01:33:46.455
All right! Everybody out!

1572
01:33:46.538 --> 01:33:49.249
- Put your masks on!
- Everyone out! Out!

1573
01:33:49.333 --> 01:33:52.127
- Go now!
- Go!

1574
01:33:52.211 --> 01:33:54.922
Go! Go! Go!

1575
01:33:55.923 --> 01:33:57.800
- Now!
- Get the fuck out!

1576
01:33:57.883 --> 01:33:59.092
Move!

1577
01:33:59.176 --> 01:34:02.304
Everybody up the fucking stairs! Move!

1578
01:34:02.387 --> 01:34:04.306
<i>A human stampede, right here.</i>

1579
01:34:07.559 --> 01:34:10.729
<i>And my favorite sequence
is coming up here.</i>

1580
01:34:10.813 --> 01:34:13.190
<i>The stampede, right here.</i>

1581
01:34:13.273 --> 01:34:16.235
<i>Listen to Terence's...
Please listen to Terence's score.</i>

1582
01:34:26.036 --> 01:34:28.080
<i>Door explodes, now you have this lull.</i>

1583
01:34:30.749 --> 01:34:32.543
<i>Bring the sound down.</i>

1584
01:34:34.878 --> 01:34:37.089
<i>That's some sensitive background, very low.</i>

1585
01:34:38.423 --> 01:34:40.300
<i>Now all hell's going to break loose.</i>

1586
01:34:41.426 --> 01:34:44.012
<i>As they come streaming out right here.</i>

1587
01:34:44.096 --> 01:34:48.225
<i>And the guys, first few out
get shot with a roll of bullets. Boom.</i>

1588
01:34:50.519 --> 01:34:52.187
Cease fire!

1589
01:34:52.271 --> 01:34:54.231
Cease fire! Cease fire!

1590
01:34:55.816 --> 01:34:57.651
<i>More shots in slow motion.</i>

1591
01:34:59.278 --> 01:35:00.821
<i>That's the roof shot.</i>

1592
01:35:02.906 --> 01:35:05.117
<i>Now here it is, mayhem.</i>

1593
01:35:05.450 --> 01:35:06.952
<i>Chaos.</i>

1594
01:35:09.288 --> 01:35:10.497
<i>Bedlam.</i>

1595
01:35:14.126 --> 01:35:19.298
<i>Used a 45-degree shutter speed
to give it that jittery feeling.</i>

1596
01:35:20.048 --> 01:35:24.386
<i>Something Spielberg did
in the Normandy invasion stuff</i>

1597
01:35:24.469 --> 01:35:26.555
<i>on</i> Saving Private Ryan.

1598
01:35:26.638 --> 01:35:31.184
<i>He said he did it because he wanted to get
the feel of the old newsreel cameras.</i>

1599
01:35:31.268 --> 01:35:32.561
Do not move!

1600
01:35:32.644 --> 01:35:35.898
- Get down, put your hands on your head!
- Put the cuffs on them! Let's go!

1601
01:35:38.692 --> 01:35:41.737
<i>Got the Spanish cops talking right there.</i>

1602
01:35:43.947 --> 01:35:47.159
<i>Terence is playing the trumpet solo.</i>

1603
01:35:47.993 --> 01:35:51.830
<i>Guess Terence is also
an accomplished trumpet player.</i>

1604
01:35:51.914 --> 01:35:53.832
<i>It's his own jazz band.</i>

1605
01:35:54.708 --> 01:35:55.709
Cuffs!

1606
01:35:58.712 --> 01:35:59.755
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1607
01:35:59.838 --> 01:36:01.965
- Don't move!
- I'm not moving!

1608
01:36:08.513 --> 01:36:10.682
- Don't move!
- Do not move!

1609
01:36:10.766 --> 01:36:13.352
Check them. Make sure they ain't got
no weapons on them and shit.

1610
01:36:13.435 --> 01:36:15.354
- Hernandez!
- Right here.

1611
01:36:17.856 --> 01:36:20.025
E.S.U. team, line up!

1612
01:36:27.824 --> 01:36:30.827
<i>Now hear this, look, that trumpet right there.</i>

1613
01:36:33.705 --> 01:36:35.582
<i>That's from</i> Patton.

1614
01:36:35.666 --> 01:36:38.043
<i>Jerry Goldsmith. Do you hear that?</i>

1615
01:36:38.126 --> 01:36:40.629
<i>That trumpet right there, that's from</i> Patton.

1616
01:36:40.712 --> 01:36:45.342
<i>The great Jerry Goldsmith,
the late Jerry Goldsmith did the score.</i>

1617
01:36:45.425 --> 01:36:49.763
<i>Another of the great scores</i>
<i>he did was</i> Chinatown, <i>too.</i>

1618
01:36:49.846 --> 01:36:54.059
<i>I'll admit, I mean the guy did over 100 films,
more than that.</i>

1619
01:36:54.142 --> 01:36:55.936
<i>That's an homage to him.</i>

1620
01:36:58.563 --> 01:37:01.149
<i>One more time, there it is, right there.</i>

1621
01:37:03.568 --> 01:37:06.405
<i>That's the real bank location.</i>

1622
01:37:08.949 --> 01:37:12.202
<i>We're going down the steps,
it's gonna be on the stage, right here.</i>

1623
01:37:12.285 --> 01:37:14.079
Team in, team in. Let's go.

1624
01:37:16.999 --> 01:37:20.836
<i>Those lights, you remember</i> E.T.?
<i>We had those... We're looking for E.T.</i>

1625
01:37:20.919 --> 01:37:24.715
<i>with the flashlights?
That's what this reminds me of, right here.</i>

1626
01:37:24.798 --> 01:37:29.928
<i>Looking for E.T. in the night time
with these strong flashlights...</i>

1627
01:37:31.179 --> 01:37:33.223
<i>Shaft of light. The smoke.</i>

1628
01:37:34.224 --> 01:37:35.600
<i>All Steadicam.</i>

1629
01:37:37.686 --> 01:37:39.104
<i>Moving around.</i>

1630
01:37:41.648 --> 01:37:43.191
<i>You're back to Willem Dafoe.</i>

1631
01:37:43.275 --> 01:37:44.693
- I'll keep looking.
- Stay on it.

1632
01:37:44.776 --> 01:37:45.777
Roger that.

1633
01:37:46.987 --> 01:37:48.739
Ready? Let's go.

1634
01:37:52.743 --> 01:37:54.619
This is the last door.

1635
01:38:01.793 --> 01:38:04.588
- Clear, Sarge!
- Come on down.

1636
01:38:05.964 --> 01:38:12.304
<i>Steadicam brings Dafoe, Chiwe and D down.</i>

1637
01:38:13.096 --> 01:38:15.557
<i>Go into the bank vault.</i>

1638
01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:18.018
Maybe, but I'm pretty sure we're
the only ones moving around down here.

1639
01:38:18.101 --> 01:38:20.812
Check this out. They forgot to rob the joint.

1640
01:38:20.896 --> 01:38:23.565
- Holy shit.
- And you didn't find anybody?

1641
01:38:23.648 --> 01:38:25.567
We're still looking,
but there are no bad guys,

1642
01:38:25.650 --> 01:38:27.903
no booby traps, no tunnels, no damage.

1643
01:38:27.986 --> 01:38:29.780
- And nothing missing.
- Great, great, great.

1644
01:38:29.863 --> 01:38:32.657
We'll put out a city-wide description
for David fucking Copperfield, then, huh?

1645
01:38:32.741 --> 01:38:34.493
Listen, I'm not trying to tell you
your jobs, Detectives,

1646
01:38:34.576 --> 01:38:36.495
but unless they swam out
through the toilets,

1647
01:38:36.578 --> 01:38:38.413
whoever did this
is upstairs sucking pavement.

1648
01:38:38.497 --> 01:38:39.498
All right, good job.

1649
01:38:39.915 --> 01:38:40.916
What's that?

1650
01:38:43.877 --> 01:38:44.878
Cell phones.

1651
01:38:45.837 --> 01:38:48.215
- Hey, guys! You need to see this.
- Okay.

1652
01:38:48.298 --> 01:38:52.260
<i>That guy right there, that's Jeff Ward.
Jeff Ward's the stunt coordinator.</i>

1653
01:38:52.344 --> 01:38:54.930
<i>Not only for this film,</i> Inside Man,
<i>but many others.</i>

1654
01:38:55.013 --> 01:38:57.265
Don't let anybody get tempted,
including you!

1655
01:38:57.349 --> 01:38:59.017
Yes, Sir!

1656
01:38:59.101 --> 01:39:00.435
Right here, Detective.

1657
01:39:00.519 --> 01:39:04.272
<i>Like the camera work here. So he's come in.
Follow the rifle.</i>

1658
01:39:04.356 --> 01:39:06.274
<i>Goes Denzel.</i>

1659
01:39:06.358 --> 01:39:07.943
<i>Follow the rifle back.</i>

1660
01:39:08.026 --> 01:39:10.403
- Toys.
- As if it wasn't weird enough already.

1661
01:39:10.487 --> 01:39:11.947
Cap, come to the ladies' room.

1662
01:39:12.030 --> 01:39:15.951
<i>Now, I'm gonna turn around</i>

1663
01:39:16.034 --> 01:39:19.788
<i>and lead Denzel through this office,</i>

1664
01:39:19.871 --> 01:39:23.500
<i>go out behind the door,
I'm going to follow him,</i>

1665
01:39:23.583 --> 01:39:26.711
<i>and it's gonna take us
all the way to the bathroom door</i>

1666
01:39:26.795 --> 01:39:29.714
<i>where we see the fake hood.</i>

1667
01:39:32.509 --> 01:39:33.760
<i>Right here.</i>

1668
01:39:34.886 --> 01:39:37.889
We can stop looking for that body.

1669
01:39:37.973 --> 01:39:39.641
Fake guns.

1670
01:39:39.724 --> 01:39:41.518
Fake execution.

1671
01:39:42.352 --> 01:39:44.437
Nobody goes home
till we get everybody's story.

1672
01:39:44.521 --> 01:39:47.315
Cap, we got something else
in the storage room.

1673
01:39:47.399 --> 01:39:50.152
<i>Now we go to the storage room.</i>

1674
01:39:50.235 --> 01:39:53.864
<i>And little does
Detective Keith Frazier realize</i>

1675
01:39:53.947 --> 01:39:59.077
<i>that Dalton Russell's right behind
that fake wall right there.</i>

1676
01:39:59.161 --> 01:40:01.496
- Porcario?
- Yo.

1677
01:40:01.580 --> 01:40:05.000
- Where's the men's room?
- Down the hallway on the left.

1678
01:40:05.083 --> 01:40:08.128
<i>Another one of my favorite shots
right here, and score.</i>

1679
01:40:10.839 --> 01:40:12.924
<i>This reminds me sort of that shot</i>
<i>like in</i> Gone With the Wind

1680
01:40:13.008 --> 01:40:17.095
<i>when we see all those
fettered soldiers dead and wounded.</i>

1681
01:40:20.891 --> 01:40:24.644
<i>It took a long time to set this up.
Crane shot.</i>

1682
01:40:24.728 --> 01:40:28.440
<i>And when we get to the end,
the bus pulls up right into it.</i>

1683
01:40:43.371 --> 01:40:46.791
Female hostages to be searched
by female officers only!

1684
01:40:48.793 --> 01:40:50.378
All right, listen, let's get these people up.

1685
01:40:50.462 --> 01:40:52.297
- I can't hear you. What?
- Valerie Keepsake.

1686
01:40:52.380 --> 01:40:54.341
Valerie Keepsake. Go, go, get on the bus.

1687
01:40:54.424 --> 01:40:56.551
- Kenneth Damerjian.
- Yeah.

1688
01:40:56.635 --> 01:40:58.220
Person one.

1689
01:40:58.303 --> 01:41:00.639
- I'm Peter Hammond.
- Eric Dodge.

1690
01:41:00.722 --> 01:41:03.516
- Wait!
- Chaim. My name's Chaim.

1691
01:41:05.310 --> 01:41:06.353
Fucking cocksucker.

1692
01:41:07.812 --> 01:41:09.397
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1693
01:41:09.481 --> 01:41:11.650
Just give me your name.
Just give me your name.

1694
01:41:11.733 --> 01:41:12.734
Say your name.

1695
01:41:14.653 --> 01:41:16.613
I work in the bank!

1696
01:41:16.696 --> 01:41:18.823
I'm the bank security guard!
Nobody's listening!

1697
01:41:18.907 --> 01:41:20.075
Okay, we'll straighten it out.

1698
01:41:20.158 --> 01:41:22.118
Everybody's saying listen!
Nobody's listening!

1699
01:41:22.202 --> 01:41:23.328
We'll straighten it out. Come on.

1700
01:41:23.411 --> 01:41:25.372
- Listen, I'm not getting on the bus!
- Yes, you are.

1701
01:41:25.455 --> 01:41:27.415
- Move! Move! Move!
- I am not! I work at the bank!

1702
01:41:27.499 --> 01:41:31.503
<i>Now you crane down to find all the robbers</i>

1703
01:41:32.504 --> 01:41:33.505
<i>sitting in a row.</i>

1704
01:41:35.173 --> 01:41:37.092
<i>Embedded with everybody else.</i>

1705
01:41:37.175 --> 01:41:38.176
<i>There goes Kim,</i>

1706
01:41:39.678 --> 01:41:41.471
<i>Bernard, the Rabbi.</i>

1707
01:41:43.098 --> 01:41:44.099
<i>Carlos.</i>

1708
01:41:47.686 --> 01:41:49.479
<i>And James, right there.</i>

1709
01:41:49.562 --> 01:41:53.775
<i>Steve, Steve-O, Stevie...
I forget the other one.</i>

1710
01:41:57.654 --> 01:42:00.782
<i>Now the siege is over, and we fade out.</i>

1711
01:42:00.865 --> 01:42:03.493
<i>But the mystery has been solved.</i>

1712
01:42:04.744 --> 01:42:06.830
<i>Fade up. Push in.</i>

1713
01:42:08.623 --> 01:42:11.751
<i>Denzel with his superior officer.</i>

1714
01:42:13.962 --> 01:42:15.839
"...<i>from soup to nuts.</i>"

1715
01:42:15.922 --> 01:42:18.675
We photograph everybody
that came out of the bank.

1716
01:42:18.758 --> 01:42:21.344
We sit them down, we question them,
we show them the photos.

1717
01:42:21.428 --> 01:42:25.598
Most of them can't point to anybody
that's guilty of anything.

1718
01:42:25.682 --> 01:42:29.144
We ask them if they could recognize
anybody who was not one of the bad guys.

1719
01:42:29.227 --> 01:42:31.980
Even if we considered someone
as a possible suspect,

1720
01:42:32.063 --> 01:42:34.733
there's one or two or three other people
that would rule them out.

1721
01:42:34.816 --> 01:42:36.109
It's like the thing never happened.

1722
01:42:36.192 --> 01:42:39.904
- What about prints?
- Everywhere. So what?

1723
01:42:39.988 --> 01:42:43.575
- All it shows is that these people were there.
- Alibis?

1724
01:42:43.658 --> 01:42:44.826
Just about everyone.

1725
01:42:44.909 --> 01:42:46.870
Even if their alibi was weak,

1726
01:42:46.953 --> 01:42:49.956
a hostage would identify them
as being one of the good guys.

1727
01:42:50.040 --> 01:42:51.499
There we are, back to square one.

1728
01:42:51.583 --> 01:42:52.584
Priors?

1729
01:42:52.667 --> 01:42:55.587
We got one employee who had
some juvie stuff. One customer had...

1730
01:42:55.670 --> 01:42:58.173
Excuse me.

1731
01:42:58.256 --> 01:43:01.051
One customer had an out-of-state warrant
for child support.

1732
01:43:01.134 --> 01:43:04.679
Another one had a couple of priors,
G.L.A. mostly.

1733
01:43:04.763 --> 01:43:08.391
Again, same problem.
Plus, he was a fucking idiot.

1734
01:43:08.475 --> 01:43:09.893
"<i>Fucking idiot.</i>"

1735
01:43:09.976 --> 01:43:12.354
I'm telling you,
they thought of everything. Almost.

1736
01:43:12.437 --> 01:43:14.898
- Sounded like everything to me.
- But this.

1737
01:43:14.981 --> 01:43:18.151
We haven't found that .357
or the perp that was holding it.

1738
01:43:18.234 --> 01:43:21.571
If you did, there'd be no prints on it anyway.

1739
01:43:21.654 --> 01:43:23.281
- Bury it.
- Bury it?

1740
01:43:23.365 --> 01:43:25.992
What the fuck do you expect me to say?

1741
01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:33.041
Captain, this thing stinks to high hell.
I mean, somebody did something here.

1742
01:43:33.124 --> 01:43:34.709
You said it yourself.

1743
01:43:34.793 --> 01:43:38.213
You got no robbery. No suspects.

1744
01:43:38.296 --> 01:43:40.256
Nobody's breathing down my neck
to come up with answers.

1745
01:43:40.340 --> 01:43:43.218
I'm not gonna breathe down yours. Bury it.

1746
01:43:45.929 --> 01:43:48.431
I wasn't expecting this.

1747
01:43:48.515 --> 01:43:51.935
I promise you,
I'll find you guys more cases to solve.

1748
01:43:54.104 --> 01:43:55.146
Okay.

1749
01:43:56.856 --> 01:43:59.859
Oh, here's something
that you probably did expect.

1750
01:43:59.943 --> 01:44:03.822
- They found that missing Madrugada money.
- No shit.

1751
01:44:03.905 --> 01:44:06.074
Yes, you want to know where it was?

1752
01:44:06.157 --> 01:44:08.660
- In my bank account?
- No.

1753
01:44:08.785 --> 01:44:10.870
- My summer house in Sag Harbor?
- No.

1754
01:44:10.954 --> 01:44:12.372
- My wallet?
- No.

1755
01:44:13.665 --> 01:44:14.791
Then, no. I don't want to know.

1756
01:44:14.874 --> 01:44:16.501
"<i>Don't wanna know.</i>"

1757
01:44:24.801 --> 01:44:27.220
<i>Keeps appearing throughout the whole film.</i>

1758
01:44:27.303 --> 01:44:29.931
<i>That 392 safety deposit box.</i>

1759
01:44:30.014 --> 01:44:31.766
I'll tell you what.
Every one of your accusers, man,

1760
01:44:31.850 --> 01:44:35.520
I say we go after them all, Keith,
Michael Corleone style.

1761
01:44:36.438 --> 01:44:38.940
<i>Homage to</i> Godfather <i>right here.</i>

1762
01:44:39.023 --> 01:44:40.483
<i>Francis Ford.</i>

1763
01:44:40.567 --> 01:44:42.444
There's no 392.

1764
01:44:42.527 --> 01:44:45.488
- Huh?
- Safety deposit box number 392.

1765
01:44:45.572 --> 01:44:47.866
According to these records, it doesn't exist.

1766
01:44:47.949 --> 01:44:50.702
Pinstriped, mayonnaise, lying motherfucker.

1767
01:44:50.785 --> 01:44:54.038
- Didn't Coughlin say we should move on?
- Let's go.

1768
01:45:01.546 --> 01:45:04.007
<i>This is another one
of those one-take scenes</i>

1769
01:45:04.090 --> 01:45:07.844
<i>with Denzel and Jodie Foster.</i>

1770
01:45:07.927 --> 01:45:10.680
<i>Denzel, right here looking like
he's with the Fruit of slam.</i>

1771
01:45:10.763 --> 01:45:14.225
<i>Harkening back to</i> Malcolm X, <i>the bow-tie.</i>

1772
01:45:15.602 --> 01:45:20.023
<i>Pan, then we dolly in.
Then he sits down. No cutting.</i>

1773
01:45:20.106 --> 01:45:21.357
<i>One take.</i>

1774
01:45:24.068 --> 01:45:26.571
<i>Push in slowly.</i>

1775
01:45:26.654 --> 01:45:29.240
<i>Very like the music here, just a piano solo.</i>

1776
01:45:29.324 --> 01:45:30.575
Let me tell you how this works. You...

1777
01:45:30.658 --> 01:45:33.077
No, let me tell you how this works.

1778
01:45:33.161 --> 01:45:36.664
<i>And the music will drop out
while we hear the recording.</i>

1779
01:45:37.832 --> 01:45:41.419
<i>It rings out, actually.
There's this slight ring out.</i>

1780
01:45:42.587 --> 01:45:45.381
<i>And it will come back in
when the recording stops.</i>

1781
01:45:45.465 --> 01:45:47.467
We'd like to be in your corner on that.

1782
01:45:47.550 --> 01:45:50.303
In exchange for what? I mean, what,
do you want me to do something unethical?

1783
01:45:50.386 --> 01:45:54.057
<i>This is the same location
as Arthur Case's office.</i>

1784
01:45:54.140 --> 01:45:56.351
<i>This is the Immigration Building,</i>

1785
01:45:56.434 --> 01:46:02.607
<i>which is now the Museum for
Native Americans, down at Battery Park.</i>

1786
01:46:02.690 --> 01:46:03.942
<i>Great location.</i>

1787
01:46:04.025 --> 01:46:05.235
Done.

1788
01:46:05.318 --> 01:46:06.694
Kaput.

1789
01:46:08.571 --> 01:46:11.866
<i>Score comes back in, right here.</i>

1790
01:46:11.950 --> 01:46:14.244
<i>Jodie showing off those legs.</i>

1791
01:46:14.327 --> 01:46:16.371
<i>Manolo Blahniks, whatever they call them.</i>

1792
01:46:18.122 --> 01:46:22.377
<i>Know they cost $900.
My wife got too many of them.</i>

1793
01:46:24.087 --> 01:46:27.465
"When there's blood on the streets,
buy property."

1794
01:46:29.634 --> 01:46:32.929
I think Mr. Case
really took that sentiment to heart.

1795
01:46:33.012 --> 01:46:36.808
But he is no different
than half the Fortune 500.

1796
01:46:37.392 --> 01:46:39.185
Let it go, Detective.

1797
01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:42.188
You're a good cop.

1798
01:46:43.231 --> 01:46:44.983
This city needs you.

1799
01:46:47.777 --> 01:46:51.281
<i>Now this shot coming up.</i>

1800
01:46:53.283 --> 01:46:54.993
<i>The spiral staircase,</i>

1801
01:46:56.327 --> 01:46:58.705
<i>as Detective Frazier</i>

1802
01:46:58.788 --> 01:47:02.041
<i>descends into the bowels</i>

1803
01:47:02.125 --> 01:47:04.544
<i>of this corruption</i>

1804
01:47:04.627 --> 01:47:08.047
<i>and these dirty people
who sell their mother for money.</i>

1805
01:47:12.552 --> 01:47:15.388
- Lady! Lady, you're in the wrong place.
- I have an appointment.

1806
01:47:15.471 --> 01:47:17.599
<i>Now the actor, right there,</i>

1807
01:47:17.682 --> 01:47:21.352
<i>Ernest Rains, he was
in my first student film, NYU.</i>

1808
01:47:21.436 --> 01:47:23.896
<i>The film was called</i> The Answer,
<i>a 20-minute film.</i>

1809
01:47:23.980 --> 01:47:25.607
<i>He was the lead actor in it.</i>

1810
01:47:25.690 --> 01:47:26.774
Arthur.

1811
01:47:26.858 --> 01:47:29.235
- Good morning.
- Miss White.

1812
01:47:30.194 --> 01:47:31.696
Have a seat.

1813
01:47:33.072 --> 01:47:34.699
Thank you, Vincent.

1814
01:47:34.782 --> 01:47:39.287
<i>Very funny thing
about this character, Arthur Case.</i>

1815
01:47:40.663 --> 01:47:44.584
<i>Now, when I did press here in the States,</i>

1816
01:47:44.667 --> 01:47:48.630
<i>they would comment about it.
But it was only when I got to Europe,</i>

1817
01:47:48.713 --> 01:47:50.423
<i>when journalists would say,</i>

1818
01:47:50.506 --> 01:47:55.678
"<i>Was Arthur Case based on Prescott Bush?"</i>

1819
01:47:55.762 --> 01:47:59.265
<i>And I was unaware of this.</i>
<i>I said,</i> "<i>Who is Prescott Bush?"</i>

1820
01:47:59.349 --> 01:48:04.437
<i>They said,</i> "<i>That is President Bush's,</i>
<i>W's grandfather.</i>"

1821
01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:07.315
<i>And that there've been allegations</i>

1822
01:48:07.398 --> 01:48:10.693
<i>that he did business,
collaborated with the Nazis.</i>

1823
01:48:12.487 --> 01:48:14.614
<i>And so that's something
that I know I wasn't aware of.</i>

1824
01:48:14.697 --> 01:48:19.035
<i>I don't think the screenwriter,
Russell Gewirtz, was aware of.</i>

1825
01:48:19.118 --> 01:48:22.205
<i>But they definitely picked that up in Europe.</i>

1826
01:48:22.288 --> 01:48:25.667
<i>Everybody thinks, automatically,
that this character</i>

1827
01:48:25.750 --> 01:48:30.755
<i>is based on Bush's grandfather. Interesting.</i>

1828
01:48:30.838 --> 01:48:32.674
<i>I dispute it.</i>

1829
01:48:32.757 --> 01:48:35.510
<i>I'll just say, I was unaware of it.</i>

1830
01:48:35.593 --> 01:48:38.930
<i>Adds another layer to the film, doesn't it?</i>

1831
01:48:40.348 --> 01:48:44.310
If someday
he comes back to blackmail you, well,

1832
01:48:44.394 --> 01:48:47.313
you'll pay him. And you'll get it back.

1833
01:48:48.606 --> 01:48:50.525
- So, I guess that's it.
- I suppose so.

1834
01:48:50.608 --> 01:48:52.402
- Bullshit.
- I beg your pardon?

1835
01:48:52.485 --> 01:48:56.739
He didn't go through all that just to stick
your envelope under his mattress.

1836
01:48:56.823 --> 01:48:59.075
Look, they left money untouched, Arthur.

1837
01:48:59.158 --> 01:49:02.370
<i>String quartet doing the score, right here.</i>

1838
01:49:02.453 --> 01:49:05.790
So, he had to have walked out of there
with something else.

1839
01:49:05.873 --> 01:49:11.212
<i>We had a discussion as to whether
it should be played as source or score.</i>

1840
01:49:11.295 --> 01:49:15.633
<i>Source, meaning as it was coming
from the radio, in this barbershop.</i>

1841
01:49:15.717 --> 01:49:18.010
<i>I decided it should be played as score.</i>

1842
01:49:18.094 --> 01:49:21.347
There's only one thing it could be anyway.

1843
01:49:21.431 --> 01:49:23.683
<i>This is the Arthur Case theme, right here.</i>

1844
01:49:23.766 --> 01:49:25.643
- Diamonds.
- "<i>Diamonds.</i>"

1845
01:49:25.727 --> 01:49:27.437
And then there's the ring.

1846
01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:29.731
<i>This whole diamond ring thing again</i>

1847
01:49:29.814 --> 01:49:34.610
<i>was stuff that was worked at
during the shoot.</i>

1848
01:49:36.487 --> 01:49:38.740
<i>Terry George came up with this stuff.</i>

1849
01:49:38.823 --> 01:49:40.158
...the ring and everything else they owned

1850
01:49:40.241 --> 01:49:44.704
was confiscated and they were shipped off
to concentration camps. None survived.

1851
01:49:47.081 --> 01:49:48.666
We were friends.

1852
01:49:49.667 --> 01:49:50.668
I could have helped them.

1853
01:49:51.836 --> 01:49:53.171
<i>Love this line.</i>

1854
01:49:53.296 --> 01:49:58.342
But the Nazis paid too well.

1855
01:49:58.509 --> 01:50:00.970
<i>Love that line.</i> "<i>The Nazis paid too well.</i>"

1856
01:50:01.053 --> 01:50:05.224
Can I trust that you will keep
what you've learnt...

1857
01:50:05.308 --> 01:50:10.480
<i>See that photo right there, right in front
of Christopher Plummer, Joe Louis?</i>

1858
01:50:10.563 --> 01:50:14.025
<i>Hopefully I get to make that film one day.
Soon.</i>

1859
01:50:14.108 --> 01:50:17.403
<i>While Budd Schulberg is still here with us.</i>

1860
01:50:17.487 --> 01:50:20.281
<i>Still here amongst us.
Budd's coming to the premiere tonight.</i>

1861
01:50:20.364 --> 01:50:23.993
<i>As I said before, he's 93 years old.</i>

1862
01:50:24.076 --> 01:50:26.579
Well, I'd love to tell you
what a monster you are,

1863
01:50:26.662 --> 01:50:31.501
but I have to help bin Laden's nephew
buy a co-op on Park Avenue.

1864
01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:35.463
"<i>Bin Laden's nephew.</i>"

1865
01:50:35.546 --> 01:50:38.341
If that were true, you wouldn't tell me.

1866
01:50:38.424 --> 01:50:40.593
We're listing you as a reference.

1867
01:50:44.722 --> 01:50:46.390
<i>Smile disappears.</i>

1868
01:50:55.066 --> 01:50:57.276
My name is Dalton Russell.

1869
01:50:57.360 --> 01:50:59.695
<i>Now,</i>

1870
01:50:59.779 --> 01:51:01.948
<i>unlike the beginning of the film,</i>

1871
01:51:02.031 --> 01:51:04.784
<i>we're dollying away from the wall.</i>

1872
01:51:05.785 --> 01:51:09.038
<i>As you remember, in the beginning,
we dollied towards the wall.</i>

1873
01:51:09.121 --> 01:51:11.249
<i>That's the signature shot.</i>

1874
01:51:11.332 --> 01:51:15.336
<i>The actor's on the dolly, with the camera.</i>

1875
01:51:18.631 --> 01:51:19.632
The "what" is easy.

1876
01:51:21.092 --> 01:51:24.262
Recently I planned and set in motion
events to execute the...

1877
01:51:24.345 --> 01:51:28.516
<i>And this is where it all comes together.
Right here.</i>

1878
01:51:30.434 --> 01:51:31.853
As for the "why," beyond the...

1879
01:51:31.936 --> 01:51:37.900
<i>One of the many things
that made me want to do this film is</i>

1880
01:51:37.984 --> 01:51:41.612
<i>I was surprised.
Usually when I read a script,</i>

1881
01:51:41.696 --> 01:51:43.948
<i>or when I'm in a movie theater,</i>

1882
01:51:44.031 --> 01:51:46.534
<i>the first 10 minutes of the film,</i>

1883
01:51:46.617 --> 01:51:49.829
<i>the first 10 pages of the script,</i>

1884
01:51:49.912 --> 01:51:52.540
<i>most of the time,
I know where it's gonna end.</i>

1885
01:51:52.623 --> 01:51:56.002
<i>I cannot do that with this script.</i>

1886
01:51:56.085 --> 01:51:59.046
<i>So therefore, if I didn't know
where it was gonna end,</i>

1887
01:51:59.130 --> 01:52:03.342
<i>there's a good chance the audience
would not know until the final scene.</i>

1888
01:52:03.426 --> 01:52:07.597
<i>The final scene is where we want
all the revelations to come out.</i>

1889
01:52:07.680 --> 01:52:09.932
<i>Where everything that was in darkness
is exposed to light,</i>

1890
01:52:10.016 --> 01:52:14.145
<i>and the audience can have that</i> "<i>Ah-ha"</i>
<i>moment, like that</i> "<i>Oh, shit" moment.</i>

1891
01:52:14.228 --> 01:52:17.565
<i>Which I think we deliver in this film.</i>

1892
01:52:23.821 --> 01:52:25.448
<i>Plugs that up.</i>

1893
01:52:29.994 --> 01:52:31.996
<i>Crane down from the flag</i>

1894
01:52:33.205 --> 01:52:34.498
<i>to the Volkswagen,</i>

1895
01:52:35.750 --> 01:52:39.795
<i>with the crew, waiting for Dalton</i>

1896
01:52:40.671 --> 01:52:43.883
<i>to walk out the front door, like he said.</i>

1897
01:52:43.966 --> 01:52:48.179
<i>The window rolls down, now we see</i>

1898
01:52:48.262 --> 01:52:51.766
<i>the Rabbi.</i>
"<i>Oh shit, the Rabbi was part of it.</i>"

1899
01:52:52.350 --> 01:52:54.685
<i>Kim, Carlos, James...</i>

1900
01:53:00.232 --> 01:53:05.821
<i>And just as Dalton's coming out,</i>

1901
01:53:05.905 --> 01:53:08.824
<i>Frazier and Mitchell, pulling up.</i>

1902
01:53:12.495 --> 01:53:16.707
<i>Clive got the Yankee joint on,</i>
<i>the interlocking</i> "<i>N" and</i> "<i>Y"</i>.

1903
01:53:16.791 --> 01:53:19.335
- ...for me?
- Can't say. It's just the two of them.

1904
01:53:24.882 --> 01:53:27.259
<i>Steadicam, down the steps.</i>

1905
01:53:28.135 --> 01:53:29.595
<i>He walks towards the camera.</i>

1906
01:53:30.972 --> 01:53:33.057
<i>And we're gonna make a 360.</i>

1907
01:53:37.895 --> 01:53:40.982
<i>He slips out of the storage room.</i>

1908
01:53:41.065 --> 01:53:43.818
<i>Going up the stairs and out the door.</i>

1909
01:53:49.323 --> 01:53:51.784
<i>Crane down from top of the bank.</i>

1910
01:53:52.118 --> 01:53:54.203
<i>Denzel and Chiwe walking up.</i>

1911
01:53:56.872 --> 01:53:59.750
<i>Clive walking out. Boom.</i>

1912
01:53:59.834 --> 01:54:02.670
<i>Another angle right there, boom, the bump.</i>

1913
01:54:04.922 --> 01:54:08.509
<i>Go over to Peter Hammond,
face still a little bruised.</i>

1914
01:54:11.554 --> 01:54:13.347
<i>Dalton's theme.</i>

1915
01:54:13.889 --> 01:54:16.434
<i>Intercut back and forth between the two.</i>

1916
01:54:17.518 --> 01:54:19.520
<i>All coming together now.</i>

1917
01:54:19.603 --> 01:54:21.772
<i>Putting everything together.</i>

1918
01:54:30.406 --> 01:54:31.532
Oh, thank God.

1919
01:54:31.615 --> 01:54:34.660
<i>Kisses lady, she kisses her man.</i>

1920
01:54:37.455 --> 01:54:39.457
Where is it?

1921
01:54:39.540 --> 01:54:40.958
I left it in there.

1922
01:54:41.042 --> 01:54:42.877
This way, Detectives.

1923
01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:45.337
Why did you do that? You left the ring.

1924
01:54:45.421 --> 01:54:47.631
Trust me.

1925
01:54:47.715 --> 01:54:49.675
I left it in good hands.

1926
01:54:50.259 --> 01:54:51.886
I'm no martyr.

1927
01:54:52.595 --> 01:54:53.971
<i>392.</i>

1928
01:54:56.265 --> 01:54:59.685
<i>Pushing in, all the way.</i>

1929
01:54:59.769 --> 01:55:01.395
<i>Peter Hammond gonna try to open it up.</i>

1930
01:55:01.479 --> 01:55:04.482
<i>Denzel says,</i> "<i>Yo, hold up. I got it.</i>"

1931
01:55:05.858 --> 01:55:09.987
I was stealing from a man
who traded his away for a few dollars.

1932
01:55:10.071 --> 01:55:11.822
<i>Voiceover by Clive.</i>

1933
01:55:13.991 --> 01:55:17.078
<i>Well-written, intelligent script.</i>

1934
01:55:17.161 --> 01:55:20.289
...of good deeds and a sea of respectability.

1935
01:55:21.123 --> 01:55:24.752
<i>Hold up, I got it, I got it. Step back.</i>

1936
01:55:27.046 --> 01:55:28.047
But inevitably...

1937
01:55:29.548 --> 01:55:31.759
<i>Now you can see the contents.</i>

1938
01:55:33.803 --> 01:55:36.013
<i>What? That motherfucker left
the Juicy Fruit...</i>

1939
01:55:39.683 --> 01:55:40.851
<i>Son of a bitch.</i>

1940
01:55:42.812 --> 01:55:44.355
It will not fail.

1941
01:55:45.064 --> 01:55:47.149
<i>Wanna thank our friends at Cartier.</i>

1942
01:55:47.233 --> 01:55:49.110
<i>If you wanna buy that ring?</i>

1943
01:55:49.193 --> 01:55:51.487
<i>Cheap. Million and a half dollars.</i>

1944
01:55:52.029 --> 01:55:53.697
<i>1.5.</i>

1945
01:55:54.532 --> 01:55:57.785
<i>Thank you, Cartier, that's the real thing.</i>

1946
01:55:57.868 --> 01:56:00.204
<i>Three days we needed that on the set,</i>

1947
01:56:01.038 --> 01:56:05.292
<i>and they came through with flying colors.
Appreciate it.</i>

1948
01:56:12.424 --> 01:56:14.051
<i>The showdown. Right here.</i>

1949
01:56:14.510 --> 01:56:17.138
- Detective Frazier.
- Mr. Case.

1950
01:56:17.221 --> 01:56:19.181
- How are you?
- I am great.

1951
01:56:19.265 --> 01:56:23.602
<i>Heavyweights.
Mr. Washington and Mr. Plummer.</i>

1952
01:56:23.686 --> 01:56:24.979
That's wonderful. Wonderful.

1953
01:56:25.062 --> 01:56:26.814
- Detective Mitchell.
- Mr. Case.

1954
01:56:26.897 --> 01:56:28.732
- Be seated, gentlemen.
- Thank you.

1955
01:56:28.816 --> 01:56:30.943
<i>Showdown.</i>

1956
01:56:31.277 --> 01:56:33.195
I must say

1957
01:56:33.362 --> 01:56:36.949
I was most impressed

1958
01:56:37.032 --> 01:56:38.826
by the way you handled that business.

1959
01:56:38.909 --> 01:56:40.161
Thank you, Mr. Case.

1960
01:56:40.244 --> 01:56:41.996
Whenever I hear the term
"New York's Finest"

1961
01:56:42.079 --> 01:56:43.873
you're who I think of.

1962
01:56:43.956 --> 01:56:46.625
You keep the rest of us safe
and make it look easy.

1963
01:56:49.712 --> 01:56:52.006
- Pardon me.
- Well, what's so amusing?

1964
01:56:52.089 --> 01:56:54.884
When you say "the rest of us", Mr. Case,
I mean, you got to look around.

1965
01:56:54.967 --> 01:56:59.221
"The rest of us" is a category
that you haven't qualified for in a long time.

1966
01:56:59.305 --> 01:57:01.891
Touché, Detective.
I won't deny it. I've done well.

1967
01:57:01.974 --> 01:57:04.185
Yes, you have. But I'm very confused.

1968
01:57:04.268 --> 01:57:06.729
You see, I got a case

1969
01:57:06.812 --> 01:57:09.815
where armed robbers
laid siege to your bank.

1970
01:57:09.899 --> 01:57:11.025
It is your bank, right?

1971
01:57:11.108 --> 01:57:12.568
Well, I'm Chairman of the Board of Directors.

1972
01:57:12.651 --> 01:57:14.695
Then...

1973
01:57:14.778 --> 01:57:17.198
The robbers disappear. Poof.

1974
01:57:17.281 --> 01:57:18.532
And they don't take a nickel, right?

1975
01:57:18.616 --> 01:57:20.993
- You're asking me?
- Yes, I'm asking you.

1976
01:57:21.076 --> 01:57:23.162
I mean, it's your bank. You own it.
I'm asking you.

1977
01:57:23.245 --> 01:57:25.039
It's a tiny part of our organization.

1978
01:57:25.122 --> 01:57:27.833
No robbers. No real victims.
No loot missing.

1979
01:57:27.917 --> 01:57:29.710
It's got to be the first time
in law-enforcement history.

1980
01:57:29.793 --> 01:57:31.003
I never heard of it before.

1981
01:57:31.086 --> 01:57:33.547
So, you got to ask yourself, "What the fuck
happened?" Don't you, Mr. Case?

1982
01:57:33.631 --> 01:57:34.673
"<i>What the fuck happened?"</i>

1983
01:57:34.757 --> 01:57:35.883
I'm not quite sure I like your tone, Officer.

1984
01:57:35.966 --> 01:57:38.093
You don't like my tone?
Then give me a straight answer.

1985
01:57:38.177 --> 01:57:40.054
It's the founding bank of your empire.

1986
01:57:40.137 --> 01:57:44.058
<i>The photo behind, right there, that photo.</i>

1987
01:57:44.141 --> 01:57:49.355
<i>That's George and Barbara Bush,
photographed with Christopher Plummer.</i>

1988
01:57:49.438 --> 01:57:52.149
<i>His character, let me say, Arthur Case.</i>

1989
01:57:54.985 --> 01:57:57.696
<i>But there's another shot
that was in focus. Not right here.</i>

1990
01:57:57.780 --> 01:57:59.156
392.

1991
01:58:00.157 --> 01:58:02.576
Safe deposit box 392.
What's the story on that?

1992
01:58:02.660 --> 01:58:04.954
- I have no idea what you're...
- Don't lie to me, Mr. Case.

1993
01:58:05.037 --> 01:58:07.706
- I don't lie.
- I looked at all the records.

1994
01:58:07.790 --> 01:58:11.460
All the bank records
for safe deposit boxes at your bank.

1995
01:58:11.543 --> 01:58:13.087
At first glance, everything looked fine,

1996
01:58:13.170 --> 01:58:17.049
but there was one safe deposit box
that had no records.

1997
01:58:17.132 --> 01:58:19.093
I mean, going all the way back to 1948.

1998
01:58:19.176 --> 01:58:22.680
So I started thinking.
Who would have the answer to this riddle?

1999
01:58:22.763 --> 01:58:24.181
Probably the man who forgot to mention

2000
01:58:24.265 --> 01:58:26.725
that he built the bank
in the first place in 1948.

2001
01:58:26.809 --> 01:58:29.520
It doesn't add up, Mr. Case.
It does not add up.

2002
01:58:30.729 --> 01:58:34.525
I'm afraid I can't be
of any further use to you, Detective.

2003
01:58:34.900 --> 01:58:38.112
<i>Arthur Case had enough.
It's getting too hot in there.</i>

2004
01:58:39.363 --> 01:58:43.993
Mr. Frazier, I have spent
my whole life serving humanity.

2005
01:58:45.619 --> 01:58:48.289
You can ask anyone who knows me.

2006
01:58:48.539 --> 01:58:49.540
<i>Margaret Thatcher.</i>

2007
01:58:50.582 --> 01:58:53.877
<i>That was shot of Giuliani and him
that we cut out.</i>

2008
01:58:55.045 --> 01:58:56.797
<i>That's a re-shoot, right there.</i>

2009
01:58:56.880 --> 01:58:58.716
<i>That shot, right there is a re-shoot.</i>

2010
01:58:59.341 --> 01:59:01.218
<i>Come back, add that shot where he said</i>

2011
01:59:01.302 --> 01:59:02.886
"<i>Fuck you" with the ring,</i>
<i>that was a re-shoot.</i>

2012
01:59:04.054 --> 01:59:07.433
I want you to know,
we really appreciate that.

2013
01:59:07.516 --> 01:59:08.684
How gracious.

2014
01:59:08.767 --> 01:59:09.852
Let's go.

2015
01:59:09.935 --> 01:59:10.936
<i>Break down the hat.</i>

2016
01:59:11.061 --> 01:59:12.604
We're gonna follow that ring.

2017
01:59:12.688 --> 01:59:15.441
<i>That's an ADR line right there,</i>
"<i>Follow that ring.</i>"

2018
01:59:15.524 --> 01:59:18.235
<i>Chiwe gives him the evil eye.</i>

2019
01:59:18.319 --> 01:59:19.320
<i>And they split.</i>

2020
01:59:19.486 --> 01:59:21.822
- Hey, Keith, let me see your shoe.
- What?

2021
01:59:21.905 --> 01:59:24.241
- Let me see your shoe.
- Why?

2022
01:59:24.325 --> 01:59:26.160
'Cause I have never seen anybody
put their foot...

2023
01:59:26.243 --> 01:59:32.333
<i>That's Trinity Church, right there. Very close
to Ground Zero, World Trade Center.</i>

2024
01:59:32.416 --> 01:59:34.835
You cut him an ass
the length of the Lincoln Tunnel.

2025
01:59:34.918 --> 01:59:37.546
We're gonna need a traffic cop on that shit.

2026
01:59:41.592 --> 01:59:46.889
<i>This is an additional scene that we came
back to shoot at Four Seasons.</i>

2027
01:59:46.972 --> 01:59:48.724
Good afternoon, sir.
Do you have a reservation?

2028
01:59:48.807 --> 01:59:54.021
<i>It was felt that there be no mistake
that Detective Keith Frazier</i>

2029
01:59:54.104 --> 01:59:58.484
<i>is gonna go and pursue this
till somebody ends up in prison.</i>

2030
01:59:58.567 --> 02:00:02.237
"When there's blood on the streets,
somebody's got to go to jail."

2031
02:00:02.321 --> 02:00:04.198
<i>That's why we came back to shoot this.</i>

2032
02:00:04.281 --> 02:00:06.367
...please excuse us for a minute?

2033
02:00:08.202 --> 02:00:09.703
What's this about, Detective?

2034
02:00:09.787 --> 02:00:13.374
I believe Detective Frazier
is looking for some closure?

2035
02:00:13.457 --> 02:00:15.709
That's a good word. Closure.

2036
02:00:15.793 --> 02:00:18.379
Case closed, you know what I mean?

2037
02:00:18.462 --> 02:00:19.755
This is the number

2038
02:00:19.838 --> 02:00:23.801
of the War Crimes Issues office
in Washington, D.C.

2039
02:00:26.011 --> 02:00:28.263
How'd you like to be on the front page
of the <i>New York Times?</i>

2040
02:00:28.347 --> 02:00:29.473
That'd be great.

2041
02:00:29.556 --> 02:00:31.975
Make sure they spell my name right, though.
That's Frazier with a "z".

2042
02:00:32.059 --> 02:00:37.398
<i>Now look at that hat. That hat does not look
the way it looked at the beginning</i>

2043
02:00:37.481 --> 02:00:41.026
<i>of the film. Even the previous scenes.
Brim is all messed up.</i>

2044
02:00:41.110 --> 02:00:44.363
We got to keep the real criminals
off the streets, Your Honor.

2045
02:00:45.906 --> 02:00:48.325
All right, well, thanks for lunch.

2046
02:00:52.955 --> 02:00:55.249
War crimes, huh?

2047
02:00:55.332 --> 02:00:57.876
What have you got me into this time?

2048
02:01:03.340 --> 02:01:05.509
<i>Right there, that's Brad Williams.</i>

2049
02:01:05.592 --> 02:01:07.845
<i>He's on our softball team.</i>

2050
02:01:07.928 --> 02:01:10.264
<i>Great, great, great centerfielder.</i>

2051
02:01:11.723 --> 02:01:14.643
<i>That thing he's holding there,</i>
<i>that's</i> "<i>Da Bomb.</i>"

2052
02:01:14.768 --> 02:01:17.604
<i>Da Bomb. Malt liquor.</i>

2053
02:01:17.688 --> 02:01:18.689
Mama?

2054
02:01:22.901 --> 02:01:25.362
- Did you bring Big Willie?
- And the twins.

2055
02:01:25.446 --> 02:01:28.115
<i>Big Willie and the twins.</i>

2056
02:01:29.199 --> 02:01:33.871
<i>This is like a film noir film, right here.
I mean, the look and the feel.</i>

2057
02:01:39.293 --> 02:01:40.461
Slow down, girl.

2058
02:01:40.544 --> 02:01:43.005
I'll get my gun off
before I get my gun off, okay?

2059
02:01:43.088 --> 02:01:44.465
Pow pow.

2060
02:01:48.594 --> 02:01:51.722
<i>I love what she does with the hat. Posing.</i>

2061
02:01:56.894 --> 02:02:00.105
<i>These little shots here, pick-ups, too.</i>

2062
02:02:01.231 --> 02:02:02.649
<i>All the stuff right here.</i>

2063
02:02:05.152 --> 02:02:07.237
<i>Came back to get it later.</i>

2064
02:02:08.155 --> 02:02:11.617
<i>It happens a lot, you know.
You shoot and you shoot and then you find,</i>

2065
02:02:11.700 --> 02:02:15.621
<i>well, you missed some shots.
So you have to go back later to get them.</i>

2066
02:02:16.622 --> 02:02:19.249
<i>But you don't have the time to get them.</i>

2067
02:02:23.128 --> 02:02:25.589
<i>Now there was some debate.</i>

2068
02:02:25.923 --> 02:02:28.300
<i>I don't really think
we should have done this shot.</i>

2069
02:02:28.383 --> 02:02:32.095
<i>I think the audience
would've remembered automatically.</i>

2070
02:02:32.179 --> 02:02:35.599
<i>But I conceded on that, just to put that in.</i>

2071
02:02:40.187 --> 02:02:42.606
<i>See, this is the revelation, right there.</i>

2072
02:02:44.858 --> 02:02:48.028
<i>What is he going to do with that ring?</i>

2073
02:02:48.111 --> 02:02:52.407
<i>I think that's going to be
an engagement ring. He's gonna have it set.</i>

2074
02:02:54.409 --> 02:02:59.122
<i>Well, I want to thank you, everyone,
for listening to the Director's Commentary</i>

2075
02:02:59.206 --> 02:03:01.166
<i>of</i> Inside Man.

2076
02:03:04.962 --> 02:03:09.800
<i>I thought it would be nice
to do this little thing right here.</i>

2077
02:03:09.883 --> 02:03:12.886
<i>James Brown used to say,</i>
"<i>Give the drummer some.</i>"

2078
02:03:12.970 --> 02:03:15.514
<i>Right here, we're saying,</i>
"<i>Give the actor some.</i>"

2079
02:03:15.597 --> 02:03:19.643
<i>Everybody contributed, one line</i>

2080
02:03:19.726 --> 02:03:24.356
<i>all the way up to Denzel,
and everybody contributed.</i>

2081
02:03:24.439 --> 02:03:28.151
<i>Everybody was a positive force on this film.</i>

2082
02:03:28.235 --> 02:03:31.238
<i>I want to thank Brian Grazer, Universal,</i>

2083
02:03:31.321 --> 02:03:36.451
<i>Ron Howard,
cinematographer Matthew Libatique.</i>

2084
02:03:36.535 --> 02:03:41.707
<i>The costume designer, Donna Berwick,
my main man, Barry Brown, Editor,</i>

2085
02:03:41.790 --> 02:03:45.627
<i>Jon Kilik,
production designer Wynn Thomas,</i>

2086
02:03:46.795 --> 02:03:49.298
<i>Russell,</i>

2087
02:03:50.173 --> 02:03:53.594
<i>Leora Rosenberg and her husband.</i>

2088
02:03:55.345 --> 02:04:00.601
<i>So, thank you very much
for being part of my birthday.</i>

2089
02:04:02.060 --> 02:04:05.230
<i>Thank you, see you later.</i>
