00:00:43.876 --> 00:00:45.626
<i>On the Motherworld,</i>

2
00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:50.293
<i>one thousand kings ruled
unchallenged in succession.</i>

3
00:00:51.834 --> 00:00:54.793
<i>But in the royal
bloodline's lust for power,</i>

4
00:00:56.293 --> 00:00:59.043
<i>they consumed everything
upon their planet.</i>

5
00:01:01.043 --> 00:01:05.001
<i>The Realm marched its armies
into the vastness of space,</i>

6
00:01:05.084 --> 00:01:07.501
<i>conquering everything
in its path.</i>

7
00:01:09.668 --> 00:01:12.709
<i>The glory of the Motherworld
seemed without end</i>

8
00:01:12.793 --> 00:01:18.459
<i>until the treachery of an assassin's
blade struck down the King and Queen,</i>

9
00:01:18.543 --> 00:01:21.209
<i>severing the royal
bloodline forever.</i>

10
00:01:23.793 --> 00:01:26.668
<i>In the chaotic aftermath
of the King's death,</i>

11
00:01:26.751 --> 00:01:30.709
<i>several conquered planets on the
edge of the Motherworld's reach</i>

12
00:01:30.793 --> 00:01:33.793
<i>began to whisper of revolution.</i>

13
00:01:35.168 --> 00:01:40.334
<i>A senator named Balisarius used
the opportunity to seize power,</i>

14
00:01:40.418 --> 00:01:42.834
<i>declaring himself regent.</i>

15
00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:48.168
<i>As a show of strength, he
sent his most brutal commander</i>

16
00:01:48.251 --> 00:01:52.584
<i>into the outer reaches of
the Motherworld's dominion</i>

17
00:01:52.668 --> 00:01:57.001
<i>to find and crush without mercy</i>

18
00:01:57.084 --> 00:02:01.543
<i>those who would call
themselves rebel.</i>

19
00:02:36.501 --> 00:02:38.584
Whoa.

20
00:03:50.501 --> 00:03:51.918
Kora.

21
00:03:52.418 --> 00:03:53.418
Kora!

22
00:03:58.084 --> 00:03:59.543
I thought you were finished.

23
00:04:00.251 --> 00:04:01.959
Everyone's up in the Longhouse.

24
00:04:02.584 --> 00:04:05.543
- These are my last rows and I'll be done.
- All right.

25
00:04:06.251 --> 00:04:07.084
Okay.

26
00:04:07.168 --> 00:04:08.376
Oh. Uh…

27
00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.043
Den was asking where you were.

28
00:04:11.793 --> 00:04:14.834
He and his brother got
a big snow-elk, male.

29
00:04:14.918 --> 00:04:16.876
He wanted you to see it
before he dressed it.

30
00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.668
Why was he asking for me?

31
00:04:18.751 --> 00:04:20.668
Well, you know, because he's…

32
00:04:21.834 --> 00:04:23.001
I, I just thought…

33
00:04:24.126 --> 00:04:25.501
I just thought…

34
00:04:25.584 --> 00:04:26.584
You thought?

35
00:04:30.168 --> 00:04:31.543
Move up.

36
00:04:49.751 --> 00:04:53.543
It's been a while since we've had
fresh meat. Forgot how good it is.

37
00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:56.168
Den said they saw
the summer herds returning.

38
00:04:56.251 --> 00:04:58.084
Maybe three days' ride away.

39
00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:03.418
- He was asking for you.
- I heard.

40
00:05:05.084 --> 00:05:06.751
And, yes, it's quite impressive.

41
00:05:06.834 --> 00:05:09.459
Which one? The animal?

42
00:05:11.459 --> 00:05:12.459
Or…

43
00:05:19.168 --> 00:05:20.543
Or the hunter?

44
00:05:23.251 --> 00:05:24.251
Hey!

45
00:05:32.668 --> 00:05:33.668
My people,

46
00:05:33.751 --> 00:05:36.918
it is my duty as the
head of this community

47
00:05:37.001 --> 00:05:41.001
to remind you that the gods of
the harvest demand a tribute.

48
00:05:41.834 --> 00:05:42.834
Yeah.

49
00:05:42.918 --> 00:05:44.209
An offering.

50
00:05:44.876 --> 00:05:48.084
But we all know it is
the thrusting of hips…

51
00:05:49.334 --> 00:05:55.334
…and the loud sounds of pleasure
that summon the seedlings to sprout.

52
00:05:55.751 --> 00:05:57.334
Yeah!

53
00:05:57.418 --> 00:05:59.459
So make love tonight.

54
00:05:59.543 --> 00:06:03.293
For the harvest. For
the very food we eat.

55
00:06:03.376 --> 00:06:05.209
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

56
00:06:05.293 --> 00:06:06.376
For the gods!

57
00:06:12.501 --> 00:06:13.876
Let's have some music.

58
00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:16.126
Some music to get
us in the mood.

59
00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:48.168
Den is a good man.

60
00:06:50.418 --> 00:06:51.626
You should be asleep.

61
00:06:53.626 --> 00:06:55.251
He's the best hunter among us.

62
00:06:56.168 --> 00:06:57.418
And a loyal friend.

63
00:07:00.834 --> 00:07:04.251
Have you thought of a more
permanent relationship?

64
00:07:05.126 --> 00:07:07.293
I know that he's
amenable to the idea.

65
00:07:08.626 --> 00:07:10.293
He's asked me himself.

66
00:07:11.126 --> 00:07:12.501
It's easy between us.

67
00:07:14.834 --> 00:07:16.543
Does it have to
be more than that?

68
00:07:20.459 --> 00:07:21.626
It's just, uh…

69
00:07:23.959 --> 00:07:27.584
That would be your last step to becoming
a full member of this community.

70
00:07:29.168 --> 00:07:31.793
I'm telling you,
this is home now.

71
00:07:35.251 --> 00:07:36.668
I want that to be true.

72
00:07:42.459 --> 00:07:43.459
You know,

73
00:07:45.084 --> 00:07:48.501
the two seasons I've spent
here have given me happiness

74
00:07:49.793 --> 00:07:51.168
that I don't deserve.

75
00:07:54.001 --> 00:07:56.334
But understand, I
am a child of war.

76
00:07:58.626 --> 00:08:02.584
To truly love and be loved, I…

77
00:08:04.501 --> 00:08:06.584
I don't know if I'm
capable of either.

78
00:08:09.918 --> 00:08:15.709
The very idea of love, of…
family was beaten out of me.

79
00:08:18.959 --> 00:08:21.001
I was taught that
love is weakness.

80
00:08:24.376 --> 00:08:25.376
And I…

81
00:08:27.626 --> 00:08:29.834
I don't know how that
will ever change.

82
00:08:38.501 --> 00:08:39.876
You should get some rest.

83
00:08:42.668 --> 00:08:43.584
Yeah.

84
00:08:55.668 --> 00:08:57.626
I noticed you
left early last night.

85
00:08:58.251 --> 00:08:59.668
Were you tired?

86
00:08:59.751 --> 00:09:02.543
That's right. I thought
I'd make it an early night.

87
00:09:02.626 --> 00:09:05.126
I thought you were doing
your part for the harvest.

88
00:09:05.209 --> 00:09:07.876
Because as I walked home,
I passed Den's house.

89
00:09:07.959 --> 00:09:09.918
That's what it sounded like.

90
00:09:10.001 --> 00:09:12.251
Sam, I don't know what
you're talking about.

91
00:09:13.918 --> 00:09:15.084
I think you do.

92
00:10:13.376 --> 00:10:14.793
What do you think they want?

93
00:10:17.168 --> 00:10:18.209
Everything.

94
00:10:20.709 --> 00:10:23.168
I don't care what the
potential upside might be,

95
00:10:23.251 --> 00:10:25.876
a warship hanging over
our land cannot be good.

96
00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:29.168
That's your problem. Your
first reaction is always fear.

97
00:10:29.251 --> 00:10:31.126
The Motherworld
has deep pockets.

98
00:10:31.209 --> 00:10:33.834
I'm simply saying maybe
we can get a better price

99
00:10:33.918 --> 00:10:35.584
from our friends
in low orbit there,

100
00:10:35.668 --> 00:10:38.584
rather than having to deal with
the cutthroats in Providence,

101
00:10:38.668 --> 00:10:40.959
selling our grain
to God only knows.

102
00:10:42.334 --> 00:10:45.126
Don't act like we don't know you've
been selling our surplus grain

103
00:10:45.209 --> 00:10:46.959
to the enemies of
that ship up there.

104
00:10:48.209 --> 00:10:52.126
I wonder what they would say if they
found out where our excess went last year.

105
00:10:53.043 --> 00:10:54.543
Well, I'm no revolutionary.

106
00:10:55.251 --> 00:10:57.834
They offered the best price. I
don't care about their cause.

107
00:10:57.918 --> 00:10:58.918
Obviously.

108
00:11:00.584 --> 00:11:03.751
Sindri, I don't have a
side, only this community.

109
00:11:03.834 --> 00:11:05.584
That's my only loyalty.

110
00:11:06.876 --> 00:11:10.376
And I say we start by showing
them goodwill, not fear.

111
00:11:11.126 --> 00:11:14.668
That we are their partners,
not their adversaries, right?

112
00:11:16.001 --> 00:11:18.376
Did you say "partner," Gunnar?

113
00:11:18.459 --> 00:11:19.959
I did. Is that a problem?

114
00:11:20.043 --> 00:11:22.251
That ship does not
represent prosperity.

115
00:11:23.293 --> 00:11:27.168
Its purpose is to destroy,
to subjugate, to enslave.

116
00:11:27.251 --> 00:11:30.168
Partnership is not in its vocabulary.

117
00:11:30.251 --> 00:11:31.668
Give them what they ask for.

118
00:11:31.751 --> 00:11:34.501
But volunteer nothing about
how fertile this land is.

119
00:11:35.668 --> 00:11:37.376
And hope they leave
before digging too deep

120
00:11:37.459 --> 00:11:39.376
into who Gunnar sold
last year's grain to.

121
00:11:39.459 --> 00:11:42.793
- Right.
- I've heard enough. We volunteer nothing.

122
00:11:42.876 --> 00:11:44.168
Is that clear?

123
00:11:44.251 --> 00:11:45.334
They're here!

124
00:11:45.418 --> 00:11:48.918
They're coming! They're
coming! They're coming!

125
00:13:16.459 --> 00:13:20.001
Hello. I am Sindri,
father of this village.

126
00:13:20.084 --> 00:13:21.084
Welcome.

127
00:13:21.709 --> 00:13:23.459
I'm Admiral Atticus Noble.

128
00:13:23.543 --> 00:13:25.834
Loyal representative
of the slain King.

129
00:13:25.918 --> 00:13:27.626
I welcome you to
his warm embrace.

130
00:13:45.668 --> 00:13:49.376
Please, father, tell me
about this beautiful village.

131
00:13:50.459 --> 00:13:52.334
Walk with me up
to our Longhouse.

132
00:13:52.418 --> 00:13:55.626
We can have a cup of ale and I
will tell you about life here.

133
00:13:55.709 --> 00:13:59.209
Oh. Sounds perfect.
Lead the way.

134
00:14:14.959 --> 00:14:17.168
We've carved
out a simple life here.

135
00:14:18.084 --> 00:14:20.709
And we take pride in the
love of our community,

136
00:14:20.793 --> 00:14:22.918
and the hard work it
takes to survive here.

137
00:14:23.793 --> 00:14:26.001
Your people seem
healthy and well-fed.

138
00:14:26.084 --> 00:14:29.001
As their leader, much of that
prosperity must be credited to you.

139
00:14:29.084 --> 00:14:32.001
No, we are a community. The
credit is no one person's.

140
00:14:32.084 --> 00:14:34.418
Oh, I know that in the best
of times, the credit's shared,

141
00:14:34.501 --> 00:14:38.043
but when the stores are empty, you
know where the responsibility falls.

142
00:14:38.626 --> 00:14:41.126
The weight of the
leader, I suppose.

143
00:14:43.501 --> 00:14:47.626
So you… you understand the
feeling of, like, a father,

144
00:14:47.709 --> 00:14:50.084
the need to feed
your children, yes?

145
00:14:51.918 --> 00:14:54.626
I was hoping that your land and
the people of Veldt might help

146
00:14:54.709 --> 00:14:58.376
as we search for a small band of
revolutionaries hiding in this system.

147
00:14:59.209 --> 00:15:03.209
Who my commander, the Regent Balisarius,
bid me find and bring to justice.

148
00:15:04.043 --> 00:15:05.793
We are humble farmers,

149
00:15:05.876 --> 00:15:08.334
far removed from the
politics of the Motherworld.

150
00:15:08.418 --> 00:15:12.001
And still you can serve. Hmm.

151
00:15:12.084 --> 00:15:15.501
The rebels we seek have been
attacking our supply ports.

152
00:15:15.584 --> 00:15:19.293
Led by a woman named Devra
Bloodaxe, and her brother Darrian.

153
00:15:20.418 --> 00:15:22.001
Their capture's inevitable.

154
00:15:22.084 --> 00:15:25.126
However, it's taken
longer than anticipated,

155
00:15:25.209 --> 00:15:28.001
and we found ourselves
admittedly low on stores.

156
00:15:28.584 --> 00:15:32.668
And as you know or may have heard,
an army runs on its stomach.

157
00:15:33.584 --> 00:15:37.543
I was thinking of a partnership,
where you supply us with food.

158
00:15:38.209 --> 00:15:40.126
Whatever you have
to spare, of course.

159
00:15:40.834 --> 00:15:42.584
In exchange, you're
compensated at…

160
00:15:43.709 --> 00:15:45.626
Let's call it triple the
market value, shall we?

161
00:15:46.834 --> 00:15:50.459
With that windfall, you'll be able
to buy plenty of harvesters, robots,

162
00:15:50.543 --> 00:15:52.751
and won't have to do this
difficult work by hand.

163
00:15:55.418 --> 00:15:59.459
We believe that doing the work
by hand connects us to the land

164
00:15:59.543 --> 00:16:02.376
and honors these sacred
fields that give us life.

165
00:16:02.459 --> 00:16:05.459
There's peace of mind
knowing that you're invaluable

166
00:16:05.543 --> 00:16:08.959
in the important mission of rooting
out enemies of the Motherworld.

167
00:16:21.834 --> 00:16:24.084
- It's quite a proposal.
- Yes.

168
00:16:24.168 --> 00:16:26.084
If only we had
some surplus to offer.

169
00:16:26.168 --> 00:16:28.043
You see, the land is rocky

170
00:16:28.126 --> 00:16:31.959
and yields barely enough
to feed ourselves.

171
00:16:32.043 --> 00:16:34.918
So, it is with sincere apologies
that we must decline the offer.

172
00:16:35.751 --> 00:16:36.834
However, we are grateful

173
00:16:36.918 --> 00:16:40.584
for the presence of such a
benevolent and powerful protector.

174
00:16:43.251 --> 00:16:44.959
Huh.

175
00:16:45.043 --> 00:16:46.043
No surplus?

176
00:16:47.543 --> 00:16:49.626
None at all?

177
00:16:50.668 --> 00:16:51.834
Huh.

178
00:16:51.918 --> 00:16:53.459
But your land looks so fertile.

179
00:16:53.543 --> 00:16:56.834
Your fields seem larger than
what your population might need.

180
00:16:56.918 --> 00:16:58.918
Of course, I understand
how it might seem.

181
00:16:59.001 --> 00:17:03.293
Yet the scale of the planting
is evidence of the poor soil.

182
00:17:03.376 --> 00:17:06.334
And our harsh winters only
add to the short season.

183
00:17:06.418 --> 00:17:08.876
Now, what do you say we
share that cup of ale, eh?

184
00:17:21.334 --> 00:17:22.334
Sorry.

185
00:17:23.543 --> 00:17:24.543
It's just…

186
00:17:25.668 --> 00:17:27.834
I mean, look at these
beautiful people.

187
00:17:28.543 --> 00:17:32.126
I can't imagine these glowing complexions
are nourished by a barren field.

188
00:17:36.584 --> 00:17:40.876
Now… who's the man or woman among
you who oversees the harvest?

189
00:17:45.043 --> 00:17:47.459
There must be one whose thumb
is greener than the rest.

190
00:17:49.459 --> 00:17:50.459
Someone?

191
00:17:51.709 --> 00:17:52.709
Hmm?

192
00:17:53.418 --> 00:17:54.501
Yes, sir.

193
00:17:54.584 --> 00:17:56.001
- Ah.
- That is me.

194
00:17:56.876 --> 00:17:57.709
Good.

195
00:17:57.793 --> 00:17:59.751
Yes, I oversee the harvest.

196
00:18:00.501 --> 00:18:03.501
Well, if these people
trust you, then so do I.

197
00:18:04.793 --> 00:18:08.043
Trying to understand how I could be so
wrong about what this land could yield.

198
00:18:08.126 --> 00:18:09.334
That's all.

199
00:18:11.918 --> 00:18:13.584
Well, sir.

200
00:18:16.251 --> 00:18:22.043
Sindri, our beloved father, is always
looking out for the welfare of our village

201
00:18:22.126 --> 00:18:26.168
and so insists on keeping reserves
in case of famine or drought,

202
00:18:26.251 --> 00:18:28.959
which, as you know, is the
responsibility of a leader.

203
00:18:31.793 --> 00:18:35.168
But we have been
lucky these last few seasons.

204
00:18:36.084 --> 00:18:38.293
Our surplus has been
more than we can store.

205
00:18:39.543 --> 00:18:40.834
So, there might be

206
00:18:41.834 --> 00:18:44.459
a chance that we can
spare a small amount.

207
00:18:45.084 --> 00:18:47.126
Depending, of course, on
the scale of your needs.

208
00:18:47.209 --> 00:18:48.668
Mmm. Good. Good.

209
00:18:49.293 --> 00:18:53.043
Yeah, I mean, it's always wise to hold
some in reserve, isn't it, father?

210
00:18:54.543 --> 00:18:56.418
Yep. Yep.

211
00:19:01.376 --> 00:19:02.751
I am confused though.

212
00:19:03.626 --> 00:19:05.251
Curious why you
should have me believe

213
00:19:05.334 --> 00:19:07.626
this land could barely yield
enough to feed your people.

214
00:19:07.709 --> 00:19:10.251
- Seems that wasn't entirely true.
- No, wait, wait.

215
00:19:10.334 --> 00:19:13.751
Admiral, no one is
trying to mislead you.

216
00:19:14.751 --> 00:19:18.834
Sindri simply has a slightly more
conservative view on reserves than I do.

217
00:19:19.668 --> 00:19:22.501
But we're both excited about
a possible partnership.

218
00:19:24.293 --> 00:19:26.876
Just bear in mind the reality
of what we can supply.

219
00:19:33.251 --> 00:19:34.709
Father, who is this exactly?

220
00:19:35.793 --> 00:19:37.959
- Uh… My…
- He's of no consequence.

221
00:19:38.626 --> 00:19:41.251
I have been empowered by my
people to speak for them.

222
00:19:41.918 --> 00:19:44.251
This man has no authority here.

223
00:19:45.126 --> 00:19:47.709
You would be wise to ignore him.

224
00:19:48.418 --> 00:19:50.418
Well… a rift.

225
00:19:51.168 --> 00:19:53.959
It's not quite the idyllic
community I'd first seen.

226
00:19:54.626 --> 00:19:56.668
Father, if I may

227
00:19:58.084 --> 00:20:02.793
offer you some advice when dealing with
subordinates who need to be kept in place.

228
00:20:03.584 --> 00:20:07.668
I find people can lose sight of the stakes
and sometimes need a gentle reminder

229
00:20:08.251 --> 00:20:11.126
of just how those with power
deal with those without.

230
00:20:40.501 --> 00:20:41.501
Admiral.

231
00:20:42.251 --> 00:20:43.418
Sindri…

232
00:20:44.001 --> 00:20:45.001
Please.

233
00:20:45.043 --> 00:20:47.084
- No, I… I would never…
- It's fine.

234
00:20:52.459 --> 00:20:55.293
- I…
- Let me show you what I mean.

235
00:20:56.043 --> 00:20:57.043
Uh…

236
00:20:57.959 --> 00:20:58.959
Please.

237
00:21:01.251 --> 00:21:02.251
Admiral.

238
00:21:11.251 --> 00:21:12.668
No, stop!

239
00:21:14.459 --> 00:21:15.459
No!

240
00:21:26.959 --> 00:21:28.043
What did you do?

241
00:21:29.376 --> 00:21:30.834
When can I expect my harvest?

242
00:21:32.001 --> 00:21:33.334
Oh…

243
00:21:33.418 --> 00:21:34.418
I don't…

244
00:21:36.043 --> 00:21:39.168
I said, tell me, partner,
when I can expect my harvest.

245
00:21:39.251 --> 00:21:41.876
Uh… Um…

246
00:21:41.959 --> 00:21:44.251
- Nine… nine weeks.
- Very well.

247
00:21:46.126 --> 00:21:47.751
In ten weeks, I shall return.

248
00:21:49.001 --> 00:21:51.376
You shall have my 10,000
bushels prepared for my ship.

249
00:21:51.959 --> 00:21:55.418
Twelve… We barely
produce 12,000 bushels.

250
00:21:55.501 --> 00:21:56.793
We'll starve to death.

251
00:21:57.584 --> 00:21:59.418
I don't understand
what you want.

252
00:22:00.168 --> 00:22:01.168
Well, it's simple.

253
00:22:03.418 --> 00:22:04.668
I want everything.

254
00:22:22.626 --> 00:22:23.709
All right, listen up.

255
00:22:23.793 --> 00:22:26.626
I need all of this gear moved
to this big stone building.

256
00:22:26.709 --> 00:22:28.251
That should suit us for now.

257
00:22:28.334 --> 00:22:32.043
Marcus, you're gonna help me evict the
current residents from our new home.

258
00:22:32.126 --> 00:22:33.126
Copy?

259
00:22:33.543 --> 00:22:34.668
Copy you, boss.

260
00:22:36.168 --> 00:22:37.168
Copy you.

261
00:22:39.043 --> 00:22:40.168
Hello, everyone.

262
00:22:55.668 --> 00:22:59.293
I am JC-1435 of the
Mechanicas Militarium,

263
00:22:59.376 --> 00:23:00.626
defender of the King.

264
00:23:01.209 --> 00:23:03.834
Correction, of the slain King.

265
00:23:03.918 --> 00:23:05.751
It is my honor to serve.

266
00:23:06.876 --> 00:23:07.876
I'm Private Aris.

267
00:23:08.668 --> 00:23:12.418
We're moving supplies to that building,
if you wouldn't mind lending a hand.

268
00:23:13.001 --> 00:23:14.418
Thank you, Private Aris.

269
00:23:14.501 --> 00:23:17.376
That falls perfectly
into my protocols.

270
00:23:17.918 --> 00:23:21.001
I'm talking to you, you
dirty drain turtle. Come here.

271
00:23:21.084 --> 00:23:23.043
The hell you
waiting for? Get out, man!

272
00:23:38.459 --> 00:23:39.751
Mmm.

273
00:23:47.918 --> 00:23:49.168
Thank you.

274
00:24:01.876 --> 00:24:04.334
Now, what in the name of the
old gods are you looking at?

275
00:24:04.418 --> 00:24:08.209
I'm sorry, I was just waiting to
see if you needed some more water.

276
00:24:08.293 --> 00:24:09.376
Some more water?

277
00:24:13.418 --> 00:24:17.751
That's how I like 'em. Young,
strong enough to put up a fight.

278
00:24:21.626 --> 00:24:22.918
- Boss.
- Hmm?

279
00:24:23.001 --> 00:24:24.418
Look, they left us a Jimmy.

280
00:24:26.418 --> 00:24:27.668
It's a Jimmy, man.

281
00:24:30.626 --> 00:24:32.584
I didn't know we had
any of those left.

282
00:24:38.876 --> 00:24:42.001
All right, careful. The ground's
uneven till you get to the bridge.

283
00:24:42.084 --> 00:24:45.876
Thank you, Private Aris,
but I believe I can manage.

284
00:24:45.959 --> 00:24:47.584
They won't
fight anymore.

285
00:24:47.668 --> 00:24:49.793
What do you mean they
won't fight anymore?

286
00:24:49.876 --> 00:24:51.709
It's something in
their programming.

287
00:24:51.793 --> 00:24:53.376
Once the King was killed,

288
00:24:53.459 --> 00:24:57.001
they just laid down their
weapons and refused to fight.

289
00:24:57.084 --> 00:25:00.918
Just watch, no matter what
I do, he doesn't fight back.

290
00:25:05.834 --> 00:25:07.043
Hey!

291
00:25:07.126 --> 00:25:09.251
Careful with that stuff,
you stupid machine.

292
00:25:09.334 --> 00:25:11.834
I'll turn you into scrap,
you dumbshit. You hear me?

293
00:25:12.668 --> 00:25:14.251
You're not hearing me.

294
00:25:18.668 --> 00:25:20.501
Hey! Stop.

295
00:25:22.959 --> 00:25:24.584
What if I shoot
you instead, huh?

296
00:25:25.626 --> 00:25:28.459
I could kill you right
now and no one would care.

297
00:25:29.126 --> 00:25:30.918
- Would they?
- That's enough.

298
00:25:31.001 --> 00:25:33.376
What do you say? Wanna die?

299
00:25:33.459 --> 00:25:34.543
What's it, huh?

300
00:25:34.626 --> 00:25:35.626
Come on, boy.

301
00:25:38.459 --> 00:25:39.501
I said, enough.

302
00:25:44.376 --> 00:25:49.876
Get these crates into
that house now, Private.

303
00:25:50.459 --> 00:25:51.459
Yes, boss.

304
00:25:59.709 --> 00:26:01.043
Are you malfunctioning?

305
00:26:02.168 --> 00:26:03.293
No, sir.

306
00:26:05.459 --> 00:26:08.293
Get up. Go to the
river. Clean yourself.

307
00:26:11.209 --> 00:26:13.084
The rest of you, stop staring.

308
00:26:13.168 --> 00:26:14.334
Get back to work.

309
00:26:14.418 --> 00:26:16.001
Get back
to work, assholes.

310
00:26:16.084 --> 00:26:18.084
That
includes you, Marcus.

311
00:26:18.168 --> 00:26:19.543
You got it?

312
00:26:44.543 --> 00:26:45.543
Excuse me.

313
00:26:49.918 --> 00:26:52.334
Thank
you. That is kind.

314
00:26:53.043 --> 00:26:55.751
- You're a soldier?
- Long ago.

315
00:26:58.709 --> 00:27:00.834
Do you mind? I'm Sam.

316
00:27:00.918 --> 00:27:01.918
Please.

317
00:27:09.793 --> 00:27:13.751
Tell me, Sam. Do you know
the story of our slain King

318
00:27:13.834 --> 00:27:17.709
and his beautiful daughter,
the Princess Issa?

319
00:27:17.793 --> 00:27:18.834
I don't.

320
00:27:18.918 --> 00:27:22.251
Well, you remind me of her.

321
00:27:23.043 --> 00:27:27.168
In myth, she was called the
Chalice or the Redeemer.

322
00:27:27.751 --> 00:27:30.084
She was <i>pueri salvatoris.</i>

323
00:27:30.168 --> 00:27:32.334
And even before she was born,

324
00:27:32.418 --> 00:27:35.376
I and my brothers pledged
everything we were,

325
00:27:35.459 --> 00:27:38.543
everything that dwells
inside this metal skin,

326
00:27:38.626 --> 00:27:40.209
to fight in her name.

327
00:27:41.376 --> 00:27:45.709
So when word reached us on
some distant battlefield

328
00:27:45.793 --> 00:27:50.334
that she, as prophesied, had been born
of flesh and blood into our world,

329
00:27:50.418 --> 00:27:54.209
I felt a great warmth
for the universe

330
00:27:55.001 --> 00:28:00.084
and trusted that she was to usher in
a new age of peace and compassion.

331
00:28:01.876 --> 00:28:03.418
And bring us home.

332
00:28:05.876 --> 00:28:07.251
She was magic.

333
00:28:07.876 --> 00:28:10.834
Ah, yes. She
was more than magic.

334
00:28:13.293 --> 00:28:15.251
On the day of her coronation,

335
00:28:15.334 --> 00:28:18.668
she, along with our
honored King and Queen,

336
00:28:18.751 --> 00:28:23.834
were assassinated in cold blood
by those they trusted most.

337
00:28:25.334 --> 00:28:29.459
I fear we lost some measure of
our honor since that betrayal.

338
00:28:31.126 --> 00:28:34.626
I'm afraid our
compassion, our kindness,

339
00:28:35.418 --> 00:28:36.501
our very joy,

340
00:28:37.668 --> 00:28:40.959
died with that young girl.

341
00:28:49.876 --> 00:28:51.834
I think it lives in you.

342
00:29:33.626 --> 00:29:35.001
This is your fault, Gunnar!

343
00:29:35.084 --> 00:29:37.084
I didn't know that
he would kill them.

344
00:29:37.168 --> 00:29:38.793
Doesn't matter. He's dead now.

345
00:29:38.876 --> 00:29:42.168
What about the soldiers?
Next, it's gonna be the other house.

346
00:29:42.251 --> 00:29:44.459
- I don't know.
- Stop, please.

347
00:29:44.543 --> 00:29:47.834
How about we bring in the crop
and we fall on their mercy?

348
00:29:47.918 --> 00:29:48.834
Yeah.

349
00:29:48.918 --> 00:29:51.501
We make ourselves invaluable.
They wouldn't be able to kill us.

350
00:29:51.584 --> 00:29:53.876
- They would need us.
- He's right.

351
00:29:53.959 --> 00:29:58.834
Farming, that is our skill that
we can do, that they cannot.

352
00:29:58.918 --> 00:30:02.168
If we show them how good we are,
they will be forced to spare us.

353
00:30:02.251 --> 00:30:03.584
- Yes.
- Yes. Yeah.

354
00:30:03.668 --> 00:30:06.959
- Do we agree? Our work fights for us.
- Yes!

355
00:30:07.043 --> 00:30:08.963
- Our work fights for us. Yes?
- Yes!

356
00:30:10.876 --> 00:30:11.876
It's settled then.

357
00:30:11.918 --> 00:30:14.168
- We show them how valuable we are.
- Okay.

358
00:30:14.251 --> 00:30:16.376
And when we have
fulfilled our side of the deal,

359
00:30:16.459 --> 00:30:19.376
they will be forced to rethink
how much food they leave us.

360
00:30:19.459 --> 00:30:20.459
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

361
00:30:21.001 --> 00:30:24.376
We can appeal to those gentlemen in
the granary, appeal to their humanity.

362
00:30:24.459 --> 00:30:25.793
- Yeah.
- Good.

363
00:30:33.959 --> 00:30:36.876
So… it's running.

364
00:30:39.543 --> 00:30:41.876
Would've thought you'd
have had enough of that.

365
00:30:43.209 --> 00:30:45.751
You heard them.
They're delusional.

366
00:30:45.834 --> 00:30:49.459
They think those soldiers will show
mercy even after what they did to Sindri,

367
00:30:50.001 --> 00:30:51.334
right in front of them.

368
00:30:56.793 --> 00:30:59.209
When I found you in the
wreckage of that ship,

369
00:31:00.126 --> 00:31:01.709
I considered leaving you.

370
00:31:02.668 --> 00:31:04.793
I was afraid you could
bring trouble to us.

371
00:31:06.876 --> 00:31:10.376
But do I for a moment regret
bringing you into our lives?

372
00:31:10.459 --> 00:31:11.876
I do not.

373
00:31:12.959 --> 00:31:14.334
You've become a part of us.

374
00:31:15.209 --> 00:31:18.668
And yet, now you leave
when we need you most.

375
00:31:19.668 --> 00:31:21.459
When your people need you.

376
00:31:26.418 --> 00:31:27.418
I can't.

377
00:31:28.459 --> 00:31:29.501
You mean, you won't?

378
00:31:31.001 --> 00:31:32.418
This place is already lost.

379
00:31:32.501 --> 00:31:34.251
But what if that could change?

380
00:31:34.334 --> 00:31:37.418
What if we <i>did </i>fight,
not only us, but others?

381
00:31:37.501 --> 00:31:39.668
- Who else would come here and fight?
- Others! Others!

382
00:31:39.751 --> 00:31:43.751
Others that have reason to hate all
that the Motherworld represents.

383
00:31:46.376 --> 00:31:49.126
Kora, you know this
universe better than I.

384
00:31:50.793 --> 00:31:54.959
What if you could find the
warriors that Noble seeks?

385
00:31:55.043 --> 00:31:58.543
The outlaws to
fight alongside us?

386
00:31:59.293 --> 00:32:02.418
If I find warriors to fight for
Veldt, I give the village hope.

387
00:32:03.418 --> 00:32:05.626
If I give them hope, they
fight and surely lose.

388
00:32:06.668 --> 00:32:08.709
I won't have that
blood on my hands.

389
00:32:09.501 --> 00:32:12.376
Nor will I throw my life away
the same as the rest of you.

390
00:32:38.834 --> 00:32:39.834
Check this.

391
00:32:40.584 --> 00:32:41.626
Hey, water girl!

392
00:32:43.668 --> 00:32:45.268
- Come here.
- What is it?

393
00:32:45.293 --> 00:32:47.168
Did you need some more water?

394
00:32:47.251 --> 00:32:49.959
Just a… a little water.

395
00:32:50.459 --> 00:32:51.376
Stop it!

396
00:32:53.168 --> 00:32:54.251
Or what?

397
00:32:54.334 --> 00:32:58.501
Help! Help!

398
00:32:58.584 --> 00:33:00.293
Please, help!

399
00:33:03.918 --> 00:33:05.209
Help!

400
00:33:05.293 --> 00:33:06.626
- Shut up!
- Get off me!

401
00:33:06.709 --> 00:33:08.334
- Help me!
- Shut up!

402
00:33:11.251 --> 00:33:13.001
No. Please!

403
00:33:13.084 --> 00:33:17.751
- Shut up.
- Someone help me, please! Please, help!

404
00:33:17.834 --> 00:33:19.959
- Help me! Get off of me!
- Shut up!

405
00:33:20.043 --> 00:33:21.584
Get off me!

406
00:33:23.126 --> 00:33:24.126
Don't!

407
00:33:24.918 --> 00:33:27.876
Attaboy. What do
you have in mind?

408
00:33:47.209 --> 00:33:52.126
I'm gonna tie you to a post
and make you watch every day

409
00:33:52.209 --> 00:33:54.751
as she turns from a
farm girl to a whore.

410
00:33:58.918 --> 00:34:00.584
Marcus, my good man…

411
00:34:05.501 --> 00:34:07.584
This all sounds nice,

412
00:34:08.251 --> 00:34:10.168
but you're not
gonna do anything.

413
00:34:11.918 --> 00:34:15.334
Not until I split
this sapling myself.

414
00:34:22.501 --> 00:34:23.751
Then you may have her.

415
00:34:25.001 --> 00:34:26.709
Then you can all have her.

416
00:34:30.668 --> 00:34:32.834
Get off her!

417
00:34:35.501 --> 00:34:36.501
Stop!

418
00:34:46.251 --> 00:34:47.251
Stop.

419
00:34:49.126 --> 00:34:52.251
Dessert. Perfect.

420
00:34:53.001 --> 00:34:54.418
Definitely get her.

421
00:36:43.543 --> 00:36:44.459
Please.

422
00:36:44.543 --> 00:36:45.751
I will kill her.

423
00:36:46.459 --> 00:36:48.043
Is that what you want? Huh?

424
00:36:48.626 --> 00:36:49.626
Huh?

425
00:36:50.501 --> 00:36:52.834
Ah, look who decided to join us.

426
00:36:53.876 --> 00:36:56.043
Kill her. Kill them both.

427
00:37:12.834 --> 00:37:15.626
What are you waiting
for? I gave you an order.

428
00:37:15.709 --> 00:37:16.709
Kill this b…

429
00:38:06.834 --> 00:38:08.418
We're gonna have to fight.

430
00:38:12.418 --> 00:38:14.959
Kora, you may need this.

431
00:38:19.334 --> 00:38:21.209
I found it at the
site of the crash.

432
00:38:29.084 --> 00:38:30.501
I thought it was lost.

433
00:38:33.918 --> 00:38:36.168
Our culture is not
for such weapons.

434
00:38:40.501 --> 00:38:42.084
I feared it could be dangerous.

435
00:38:44.334 --> 00:38:45.501
You were right.

436
00:38:46.418 --> 00:38:47.418
Thank you.

437
00:38:50.334 --> 00:38:51.709
Where will you go?

438
00:38:52.668 --> 00:38:55.293
There is someone, a
general named Titus.

439
00:38:56.001 --> 00:38:57.751
Once a hero of the Realm

440
00:38:57.834 --> 00:39:00.793
who turned his own forces
against those of the Motherworld.

441
00:39:02.126 --> 00:39:04.459
Last I heard, he was
still out there somewhere.

442
00:39:05.209 --> 00:39:07.543
If I could find him and
men for him to lead…

443
00:39:10.293 --> 00:39:11.293
Gunnar.

444
00:39:12.251 --> 00:39:15.501
Last year, in Providence, you
sold grain to the resistance.

445
00:39:19.334 --> 00:39:23.168
Yes. I met a man there who
introduced me to the insurgents.

446
00:39:23.751 --> 00:39:24.751
The Bloodaxes.

447
00:39:25.751 --> 00:39:28.459
- Would he still know how to find them?
- It's possible.

448
00:39:29.293 --> 00:39:30.709
Then you'll take me to him?

449
00:39:31.918 --> 00:39:33.084
Of course I will.

450
00:39:36.959 --> 00:39:40.168
Hey! Bring
down one more uraki!

451
00:39:44.418 --> 00:39:46.209
A general and an army?

452
00:39:48.543 --> 00:39:50.251
We might stand a chance.

453
00:39:54.876 --> 00:39:55.876
Be careful.

454
00:40:05.126 --> 00:40:08.626
A safe journey… to
the both of you.

455
00:40:50.668 --> 00:40:52.793
So you were a
soldier for the Motherworld?

456
00:40:54.293 --> 00:40:55.668
Fighting for the Realm?

457
00:40:59.209 --> 00:41:00.459
You could say that.

458
00:41:04.168 --> 00:41:05.584
Of high rank, I suppose?

459
00:41:14.418 --> 00:41:16.126
I mean, are you
wanted for desertion?

460
00:41:17.168 --> 00:41:18.293
That and more.

461
00:41:20.168 --> 00:41:21.168
Okay.

462
00:41:22.834 --> 00:41:24.418
Anything else you wanna ask me?

463
00:41:25.793 --> 00:41:27.543
They won't
just kill us, will they?

464
00:41:28.584 --> 00:41:31.751
I mean, I understand
making an example of Sindri

465
00:41:33.293 --> 00:41:34.459
to keep us in line.

466
00:41:36.543 --> 00:41:38.751
But we're just farmers,
we're not a threat.

467
00:41:39.543 --> 00:41:41.543
How can you know
they will destroy us?

468
00:41:43.084 --> 00:41:46.251
When they first came to my
world, I was nine years old.

469
00:41:47.626 --> 00:41:49.626
They never asked for anything.

470
00:41:50.793 --> 00:41:51.959
There were no terms.

471
00:41:55.584 --> 00:41:57.459
<i>Only the lust
for destruction.</i>

472
00:42:01.334 --> 00:42:05.834
<i>The Motherworld's forces were commanded
by a young general named Balisarius,</i>

473
00:42:05.918 --> 00:42:08.293
<i>who relished the
ecstasy of combat.</i>

474
00:42:13.084 --> 00:42:16.084
<i>The people of my world had
mounted a brave defense,</i>

475
00:42:16.834 --> 00:42:20.501
<i>but it had served only to
enrage the young general</i>

476
00:42:20.584 --> 00:42:24.126
<i>and gave him provocation to take
out that anger on the innocent.</i>

477
00:42:38.959 --> 00:42:41.918
<i>I found myself face-to-face
with Balisarius,</i>

478
00:42:43.209 --> 00:42:45.376
<i>who loved commanding his troops,</i>

479
00:42:45.459 --> 00:42:47.751
<i>not from the conning
tower of his ships,</i>

480
00:42:48.293 --> 00:42:50.001
<i>but on the battlefield itself.</i>

481
00:43:35.209 --> 00:43:38.418
<i>Balisarius killed my entire
family and took me with him.</i>

482
00:43:40.293 --> 00:43:42.168
<i>I don't know why he spared me.</i>

483
00:43:43.126 --> 00:43:46.168
<i>Why, of the hundreds of
thousands that died at his hands,</i>

484
00:43:46.251 --> 00:43:47.751
<i>he chose me to live.</i>

485
00:43:49.418 --> 00:43:51.668
<i>Saw something in me, I suppose.</i>

486
00:43:53.793 --> 00:43:55.584
<i>Someone to share in his pain.</i>

487
00:44:01.168 --> 00:44:03.293
<i>They gave me the name Arthelais,</i>

488
00:44:03.793 --> 00:44:07.543
<i>began my training and education in
the histories of the Motherworld.</i>

489
00:44:08.584 --> 00:44:11.793
<i>And for five years, I lived on
that ship with its soldiers,</i>

490
00:44:11.876 --> 00:44:13.418
<i>who were my only family.</i>

491
00:44:14.793 --> 00:44:16.126
<i>No softness.</i>

492
00:44:17.084 --> 00:44:19.126
<i>Only the hard lessons of war.</i>

493
00:44:28.959 --> 00:44:31.793
<i>He took me often on
missions of diplomacy,</i>

494
00:44:32.418 --> 00:44:34.168
<i>and I was his child.</i>

495
00:44:35.126 --> 00:44:38.293
<i>I was his protégé.
I was his student.</i>

496
00:44:40.209 --> 00:44:41.751
<i>I was one of them.</i>

497
00:44:43.293 --> 00:44:45.543
<i>Daughter of a
decorated commander.</i>

498
00:44:46.459 --> 00:44:48.834
<i>Friend to the King
and the royal family.</i>

499
00:44:49.501 --> 00:44:51.584
<i>Living a life of privilege.</i>

500
00:45:11.168 --> 00:45:13.126
<i>But regardless
of my social standing,</i>

501
00:45:13.209 --> 00:45:14.918
<i>I was expected to do my duty.</i>

502
00:45:15.709 --> 00:45:17.334
<i>To fight for the Motherworld.</i>

503
00:45:29.876 --> 00:45:33.709
<i>At the Academy Militarium, they
encouraged us to find a lover.</i>

504
00:45:36.459 --> 00:45:39.043
<i>Someone we would
defend with our lives</i>

505
00:45:39.126 --> 00:45:41.709
<i>when the politics of
expansion became too abstract,</i>

506
00:45:42.751 --> 00:45:47.376
<i>and the why of the conquest was
lost in sheer savagery of combat.</i>

507
00:45:52.001 --> 00:45:55.043
Come on! Let's go! Come on!

508
00:46:01.543 --> 00:46:05.709
<i>So, at the age of 18, I was
made an officer and given a command.</i>

509
00:46:58.584 --> 00:47:01.001
<i>I fought for the
King on distant worlds</i>

510
00:47:01.084 --> 00:47:04.793
<i>under the banner of a people
who murdered my entire family</i>

511
00:47:05.751 --> 00:47:07.584
<i>and destroyed my world.</i>

512
00:47:08.418 --> 00:47:09.668
<i>They had trained me,</i>

513
00:47:10.418 --> 00:47:13.334
<i>broken me, and rebuilt
me in their image.</i>

514
00:47:17.126 --> 00:47:19.626
I'm only telling you this
so you know who I am.

515
00:47:22.751 --> 00:47:25.084
You asked how I know
that they'll destroy you.

516
00:47:27.168 --> 00:47:28.793
That's what I would do.

517
00:48:07.501 --> 00:48:08.418
Hawkshaws.

518
00:48:10.001 --> 00:48:12.709
Bounty hunters. They
work for the Imperium.

519
00:48:18.001 --> 00:48:18.834
Wait.

520
00:48:18.918 --> 00:48:20.959
Oh, no.

521
00:48:21.668 --> 00:48:23.751
That's our guy. That's
the man we came to see.

522
00:48:23.834 --> 00:48:25.959
The one that introduced
me to the Bloodaxes.

523
00:48:27.501 --> 00:48:29.751
Did the Bloodaxes give you
any other way to contact them?

524
00:48:30.418 --> 00:48:34.043
No. They said they were sheltered
on a planet called Sharaan.

525
00:48:34.834 --> 00:48:37.418
- Protected by a king named Levitica.
- Levitica.

526
00:48:40.293 --> 00:48:41.293
Come.

527
00:49:35.709 --> 00:49:36.709
Carbost.

528
00:49:38.834 --> 00:49:41.584
Anyway, I think our best
chance to find the Bloodaxes

529
00:49:41.668 --> 00:49:43.626
is to contact the Leviticans.

530
00:49:43.709 --> 00:49:45.001
It might expose us.

531
00:49:45.084 --> 00:49:47.668
First we find General Titus,
then we'll see about your rebels.

532
00:49:56.959 --> 00:49:58.251
Is this your owner?

533
00:49:58.334 --> 00:49:59.959
Move on. He's not for sale.

534
00:50:00.043 --> 00:50:03.876
Everything's for sale in this place,
so… how much?

535
00:50:03.959 --> 00:50:06.334
You know, I have
a room upstairs…

536
00:50:06.418 --> 00:50:08.876
…with relatively clean sheets.

537
00:50:08.959 --> 00:50:11.251
That's a very generous
offer. But I don't think so…

538
00:50:12.501 --> 00:50:14.501
I guarantee you, by morning,

539
00:50:15.543 --> 00:50:17.709
you're gonna be
begging me for more.

540
00:50:18.501 --> 00:50:20.418
I said, move on.

541
00:50:21.168 --> 00:50:22.751
Come on, Mama.

542
00:50:22.834 --> 00:50:25.793
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Let him come and play.

543
00:50:25.876 --> 00:50:26.876
You need to leave.

544
00:50:26.959 --> 00:50:29.626
Listen close, you
jealous little bitch.

545
00:50:35.668 --> 00:50:38.709
Now you listen close. I
told you, you need to leave.

546
00:50:59.084 --> 00:51:00.918
I'm looking for information.

547
00:51:05.834 --> 00:51:11.126
Has anyone here heard of General
Titus or know where he might be?

548
00:51:18.334 --> 00:51:21.418
Of course, General Titus.

549
00:51:23.543 --> 00:51:28.793
Crazy bastard. Turned his own men
on the Motherworld's forces

550
00:51:28.876 --> 00:51:30.918
at the Battle of Sarawu.

551
00:51:32.251 --> 00:51:34.209
Do you know of his location?

552
00:51:34.793 --> 00:51:38.418
Last I heard, he was fighting
in the coliseum at Pollux.

553
00:51:43.168 --> 00:51:45.418
I'd be careful if I
were you, little miss.

554
00:51:45.501 --> 00:51:49.293
Last hunter who went looking for
him ended up with his head on a pike

555
00:51:50.668 --> 00:51:52.626
outside the coliseum entrance

556
00:51:53.376 --> 00:51:56.459
as a warning not to bother him.

557
00:52:03.876 --> 00:52:05.251
So, he's on Pollux.

558
00:52:06.584 --> 00:52:08.959
- That's your plan?
- That's my plan.

559
00:52:11.668 --> 00:52:12.501
What?

560
00:52:12.584 --> 00:52:14.668
Guess we need to find a
ship to take us to Pollux.

561
00:52:16.001 --> 00:52:17.293
You're catching on.

562
00:52:19.876 --> 00:52:22.001
Hey! Bitch!

563
00:52:24.793 --> 00:52:25.793
Oh.

564
00:52:25.876 --> 00:52:28.001
You should have killed me.

565
00:52:28.084 --> 00:52:29.501
Now you're gonna die.

566
00:52:31.418 --> 00:52:36.668
I'm gonna give you one chance
to just turn and walk away.

567
00:52:36.751 --> 00:52:38.043
Uh-oh.

568
00:52:38.126 --> 00:52:42.584
Are you gonna give
all of us one chance?

569
00:52:59.834 --> 00:53:01.293
Kill her.

570
00:54:33.626 --> 00:54:34.626
Impressive.

571
00:54:38.876 --> 00:54:41.793
Were those Hawkshaws that
paid you working for the Motherworld?

572
00:54:41.876 --> 00:54:44.334
- I don't like bounty hunters.
- I didn't ask.

573
00:54:44.418 --> 00:54:47.126
And to be clear, I don't
like bounty hunters either.

574
00:54:47.209 --> 00:54:48.501
So you're a gun for hire?

575
00:54:48.584 --> 00:54:50.626
No. That's not my thing.

576
00:54:51.543 --> 00:54:54.584
I'm more of an
opportunist, you might say.

577
00:54:54.668 --> 00:54:55.918
A real hero, huh?

578
00:54:58.543 --> 00:54:59.543
Wait.

579
00:55:02.418 --> 00:55:04.584
Look. I heard you in there,

580
00:55:04.668 --> 00:55:06.084
trying to get to Pollux.

581
00:55:07.168 --> 00:55:08.084
I could help you.

582
00:55:08.168 --> 00:55:11.043
Oh, understand, we're
just simple farmers.

583
00:55:11.126 --> 00:55:14.209
We're searching for soldiers for
a fight against the Motherworld.

584
00:55:15.251 --> 00:55:18.418
We have some money, but this
is not the one you get rich on.

585
00:55:18.501 --> 00:55:20.084
Aye, I understand.

586
00:55:21.126 --> 00:55:23.168
Still, pay me what
it's worth to you.

587
00:55:25.043 --> 00:55:27.043
Soldiers for a fight
against the Motherworld?

588
00:55:29.418 --> 00:55:30.918
Well, my name's Kai.

589
00:55:31.001 --> 00:55:33.376
Come on, my ship's down at port.

590
00:56:08.168 --> 00:56:10.168
Right. Setting
course for Pollux.

591
00:56:11.376 --> 00:56:13.293
I need to stop
on Neu-Wodi first.

592
00:56:13.376 --> 00:56:15.626
You know, there's
a rancher there.

593
00:56:15.709 --> 00:56:17.626
He has a man that might
just work out for you.

594
00:56:17.709 --> 00:56:19.209
Is he worth our time?

595
00:56:19.293 --> 00:56:21.293
Because we can't
afford to waste any.

596
00:56:22.126 --> 00:56:23.334
I think you'll like him.

597
00:56:24.376 --> 00:56:25.751
You ever been off-planet?

598
00:56:25.834 --> 00:56:26.959
No.

599
00:56:27.043 --> 00:56:28.709
What did you do on the farm?

600
00:56:28.793 --> 00:56:33.084
I oversee the harvest, and planting,
cataloguing seeds, and making sure that…

601
00:56:33.168 --> 00:56:35.168
That sounds great. You
might want to hold on.

602
00:56:46.834 --> 00:56:49.251
Whoo!

603
00:56:49.959 --> 00:56:51.043
Whoa.

604
00:57:26.418 --> 00:57:27.459
Come in.

605
00:57:33.459 --> 00:57:35.126
Oh, Cassius, it's you. Good.

606
00:57:35.876 --> 00:57:38.334
We received a
communiqué from the Hawkshaws.

607
00:57:39.001 --> 00:57:41.251
They're requesting to
rendezvous with us.

608
00:57:42.626 --> 00:57:44.543
Apparently they've
captured a creature

609
00:57:44.626 --> 00:57:47.709
that has important information
about the insurgents,

610
00:57:47.793 --> 00:57:50.043
Devra Bloodaxe and her brother.

611
00:57:50.918 --> 00:57:53.043
Bloodaxe? Huh.

612
00:57:53.959 --> 00:57:55.501
Well, that…

613
00:57:55.584 --> 00:57:56.918
That's excellent, Cassius.

614
00:57:57.959 --> 00:57:59.626
Inform me when they arrive.

615
00:57:59.709 --> 00:58:01.126
- Yes, sir.
- Hey.

616
00:58:20.668 --> 00:58:25.209
Well, if it isn't the
bastard from Saaldorun.

617
00:58:27.584 --> 00:58:30.918
- What brings you all the way out here?
- I missed your smiling face.

618
00:58:32.626 --> 00:58:34.543
You still got that man
chained in the back?

619
00:58:34.626 --> 00:58:36.918
Tarak? Yeah, he's working
off his debt to me.

620
00:58:37.001 --> 00:58:40.543
Another couple dozen
seasons, we should be square.

621
00:58:40.626 --> 00:58:41.709
What's it to you?

622
00:58:42.209 --> 00:58:43.584
You mind if we talk to him?

623
00:58:44.751 --> 00:58:46.543
Could be a deal in it for ya.

624
00:58:48.168 --> 00:58:50.709
Well, if there's
money to be made…

625
00:58:53.543 --> 00:58:54.751
Hey!

626
00:58:56.001 --> 00:58:57.668
Hey! Tarak!

627
00:59:00.251 --> 00:59:02.126
These people
want to talk to you.

628
00:59:03.793 --> 00:59:07.293
- What got that chain on your leg?
- A long road of mistakes.

629
00:59:08.293 --> 00:59:11.001
But if you're here to accuse me
of crimes against the Motherworld,

630
00:59:11.501 --> 00:59:13.334
I'm guilty as charged.
Take it up with him.

631
00:59:13.418 --> 00:59:15.376
No. That's not why we're here.

632
00:59:17.709 --> 00:59:21.418
We're here from a small village, and
we're looking to hire some fighters

633
00:59:21.501 --> 00:59:24.834
to train and protect us against
a force from the Motherworld.

634
00:59:26.001 --> 00:59:28.084
- I'm no friend of the Realm.
- Okay.

635
00:59:28.168 --> 00:59:29.668
That's well-known.

636
00:59:29.751 --> 00:59:31.668
And I'd gladly fight with you,

637
00:59:31.751 --> 00:59:34.418
but… I have a debt on my name,

638
00:59:34.501 --> 00:59:35.834
and I honor my debts.

639
00:59:37.168 --> 00:59:38.459
What's he owe you?

640
00:59:39.418 --> 00:59:40.709
Uh…

641
00:59:40.793 --> 00:59:44.751
300,000 Darams ought to cover
any inconvenience I've suffered.

642
00:59:44.834 --> 00:59:46.251
Oh, ya bollocks.

643
00:59:46.334 --> 00:59:48.001
We don't have that
kind of money.

644
00:59:48.084 --> 00:59:49.084
No money.

645
00:59:51.543 --> 00:59:54.793
Well, I do love to gamble.

646
00:59:55.376 --> 00:59:56.584
Here we go.

647
00:59:56.668 --> 00:59:57.668
What's the bet?

648
00:59:58.876 --> 01:00:02.543
If Tarak can break that creature out
there, his debts are squared with me.

649
01:00:04.334 --> 01:00:05.584
But if he don't ride him,

650
01:00:06.334 --> 01:00:09.251
you all get a chain
and a shackle.

651
01:00:09.334 --> 01:00:10.626
That's the deal.

652
01:00:10.709 --> 01:00:11.918
Grab it tighter!

653
01:00:17.209 --> 01:00:18.293
Watch its tail!

654
01:00:19.543 --> 01:00:20.543
Can you ride him?

655
01:00:28.626 --> 01:00:31.334
Yeah… I can ride him.

656
01:00:33.584 --> 01:00:36.334
Yank it hard! Don't
let him fight you like that!

657
01:00:39.001 --> 01:00:40.126
Pull!

658
01:00:53.876 --> 01:00:54.793
Drop your leads.

659
01:00:54.876 --> 01:00:56.501
She'll tear you apart.

660
01:00:56.584 --> 01:00:59.459
Drop your leads
and clear out now.

661
01:00:59.543 --> 01:01:01.793
Suit yourself. Drop them.

662
01:01:16.834 --> 01:01:18.751
I'm
not going to hurt you.

663
01:01:22.584 --> 01:01:25.626
You're far from
home and so am I.

664
01:01:26.876 --> 01:01:28.918
See, you and I…

665
01:01:30.209 --> 01:01:31.376
…we are alike.

666
01:01:33.376 --> 01:01:35.876
We've been hurt. Betrayed.

667
01:01:35.959 --> 01:01:37.501
Our trust has been broken.

668
01:01:42.418 --> 01:01:46.709
We both know fear.

669
01:01:47.459 --> 01:01:49.209
Yet, the biggest
fear we both face…

670
01:01:58.418 --> 01:02:00.918
…is the fear of ourselves.

671
01:02:05.918 --> 01:02:06.918
That's it.

672
01:02:09.001 --> 01:02:12.709
Let's show
them we're not afraid.

673
01:02:13.334 --> 01:02:18.293
Let's show them we're more
than the shackles that bind us.

674
01:02:35.543 --> 01:02:39.668
Easy. Easy.
Easy. Let's go. Let's go.

675
01:04:55.209 --> 01:04:56.209
Whoo!

676
01:04:59.126 --> 01:05:00.168
There.

677
01:05:38.293 --> 01:05:39.293
Yeah.

678
01:05:40.543 --> 01:05:41.543
It's okay.

679
01:05:58.793 --> 01:06:01.584
Hickman, I've done as you asked.

680
01:06:02.293 --> 01:06:03.543
Your debt is square with me.

681
01:06:08.668 --> 01:06:09.751
Be good to her.

682
01:06:40.459 --> 01:06:41.793
Go! Get out!

683
01:06:41.876 --> 01:06:43.543
Hey!

684
01:06:49.834 --> 01:06:51.334
No.

685
01:06:51.418 --> 01:06:52.418
Hey.

686
01:06:52.834 --> 01:06:54.334
No. No.

687
01:07:00.418 --> 01:07:01.418
Attagirl.

688
01:07:02.209 --> 01:07:03.668
Tarak! Let's go.

689
01:07:04.626 --> 01:07:07.626
This was good. Anyone else
you know of along the way?

690
01:07:10.501 --> 01:07:12.126
I might have a couple ideas.

691
01:08:18.793 --> 01:08:20.751
So, what's the job?

692
01:08:21.626 --> 01:08:25.209
We represent a village on
a small moon called Veldt.

693
01:08:26.584 --> 01:08:28.918
This village faces the
threat of annihilation

694
01:08:29.001 --> 01:08:30.751
by the armies of
the Motherworld.

695
01:08:32.459 --> 01:08:34.501
We are looking for warriors

696
01:08:35.418 --> 01:08:37.293
to join the fight
to protect them.

697
01:08:38.918 --> 01:08:40.501
With your reputation,

698
01:08:40.584 --> 01:08:43.209
we thought it might be something
you'd be interested in.

699
01:08:43.293 --> 01:08:45.418
- Nemesis, please, please.
- Hold her.

700
01:08:45.501 --> 01:08:47.501
Help her. Please, please.

701
01:09:41.418 --> 01:09:42.459
Stay back.

702
01:09:43.376 --> 01:09:45.626
I just want to talk. That's all.

703
01:09:47.084 --> 01:09:49.626
I'm clearly distressed,
that's true.

704
01:09:52.584 --> 01:09:54.043
But I'm not stupid.

705
01:09:55.793 --> 01:09:57.918
I know why you're here.
You want the child.

706
01:09:58.626 --> 01:10:00.334
Yes, I do.

707
01:10:00.418 --> 01:10:01.834
You can't
have this one.

708
01:10:02.793 --> 01:10:04.209
This one is mine.

709
01:10:04.293 --> 01:10:06.668
She has a mother
who's waiting for her.

710
01:10:07.918 --> 01:10:09.001
Who's missing her.

711
01:10:09.084 --> 01:10:11.584
And why should I care
about that mother's pain

712
01:10:11.668 --> 01:10:13.376
when no one is here for my pain?

713
01:10:14.126 --> 01:10:17.959
This was my home before they came.

714
01:10:18.543 --> 01:10:20.126
Taste the air.

715
01:10:20.834 --> 01:10:22.918
It's poisoned my body.

716
01:10:23.001 --> 01:10:27.709
It weakens my eggs, and now,
my children cannot emerge.

717
01:10:29.126 --> 01:10:30.584
I deserve justice.

718
01:10:31.376 --> 01:10:32.376
I understand.

719
01:10:33.001 --> 01:10:34.709
But this is not the way.

720
01:10:35.834 --> 01:10:39.084
There is a difference
between justice and revenge.

721
01:10:40.418 --> 01:10:41.418
Is there?

722
01:10:42.459 --> 01:10:43.876
I'm not so sure.

723
01:10:44.501 --> 01:10:46.001
I know a mother's pain.

724
01:10:47.626 --> 01:10:49.709
I know the loneliness
of that pain.

725
01:10:50.543 --> 01:10:52.043
But you can't hurt that child.

726
01:10:54.001 --> 01:10:55.168
I won't let you.

727
01:10:55.251 --> 01:10:57.918
I believe you. But understand.

728
01:10:58.668 --> 01:11:02.376
I will kill this child.

729
01:11:02.459 --> 01:11:06.626
And I will keep killing until
every mother weeps tears of regret

730
01:11:06.709 --> 01:11:09.251
for ever having come
to the mines of Daggus.

731
01:12:05.126 --> 01:12:06.168
Shit!

732
01:12:11.959 --> 01:12:13.001
Come on.

733
01:12:20.626 --> 01:12:21.668
Let's go.

734
01:12:44.126 --> 01:12:45.709
Come. Back up! Back up!

735
01:12:50.459 --> 01:12:51.751
Come here.

736
01:14:02.709 --> 01:14:05.334
Wow. That was…

737
01:14:06.584 --> 01:14:07.626
That was amazing.

738
01:14:08.918 --> 01:14:10.501
Do not celebrate this.

739
01:14:11.834 --> 01:14:13.751
There's no honor in this.

740
01:14:14.793 --> 01:14:17.626
This could easily be
any of you lying here

741
01:14:18.668 --> 01:14:20.834
in the gutter of
some forgotten world,

742
01:14:22.501 --> 01:14:24.334
in the name of revenge.

743
01:14:26.668 --> 01:14:29.209
You would do well
to remember that.

744
01:14:56.043 --> 01:14:58.834
That was good of you
earlier. With the child.

745
01:15:01.751 --> 01:15:05.126
- I was just trying to help.
- Yes, but it's not natural for some.

746
01:15:05.209 --> 01:15:06.501
It is for you.

747
01:15:06.584 --> 01:15:10.293
Back home, you saved
Sam without hesitation.

748
01:15:13.584 --> 01:15:15.876
Kindness is a virtue
worth dying for.

749
01:15:17.168 --> 01:15:18.293
I believe that.

750
01:15:20.418 --> 01:15:21.501
I didn't always.

751
01:15:24.876 --> 01:15:27.043
I told you how I fought
on countless worlds.

752
01:15:28.668 --> 01:15:31.918
Well, word of my victories
reached my adopted father.

753
01:15:34.459 --> 01:15:35.668
And the King.

754
01:15:44.001 --> 01:15:45.584
<i>For my
loyalty and service,</i>

755
01:15:45.668 --> 01:15:48.876
<i>I was promoted to the Elite
Guard of the Royal Family.</i>

756
01:15:52.918 --> 01:15:55.334
<i>The appointment was
engineered by my father.</i>

757
01:15:57.251 --> 01:15:59.543
<i>I couldn't have known
it was something more.</i>

758
01:16:02.918 --> 01:16:04.001
<i>I was given the honor</i>

759
01:16:05.709 --> 01:16:08.293
<i>of being the bodyguard
to Princess Issa.</i>

760
01:16:19.126 --> 01:16:22.168
<i>The princess was named
after an ancient Queen Issa,</i>

761
01:16:23.543 --> 01:16:24.793
<i>the Lifegiver.</i>

762
01:16:27.251 --> 01:16:29.126
<i>In the old stories of the queen,</i>

763
01:16:30.543 --> 01:16:33.084
<i>it was said that she had
the power to give life.</i>

764
01:16:34.834 --> 01:16:36.959
<i>It seemed a myth or a metaphor</i>

765
01:16:37.043 --> 01:16:41.209
<i>created in response to the
generations of war and conquest.</i>

766
01:16:45.418 --> 01:16:48.334
<i>Yet, the story still captured
the imagination of the people.</i>

767
01:16:50.751 --> 01:16:55.418
<i>And it was believed that the princess,
my princess, might have that same power.</i>

768
01:17:00.293 --> 01:17:04.876
<i>I saw on more than one occasion
things that I… couldn't explain.</i>

769
01:17:09.376 --> 01:17:13.418
<i>Things that made me think
that she was different.</i>

770
01:17:16.376 --> 01:17:17.376
<i>Special.</i>

771
01:17:52.709 --> 01:17:54.334
The King once said to me…

772
01:17:56.751 --> 01:17:58.168
When she becomes queen,

773
01:17:59.751 --> 01:18:02.501
I believe she'll bring a
compassion that I've lost

774
01:18:03.793 --> 01:18:07.043
after all these
hard years of war.

775
01:18:08.126 --> 01:18:10.459
<i>"It will be the
dawn of something better."</i>

776
01:18:12.043 --> 01:18:15.459
- I think your friendship makes her safer.
<i>- That our friendship made her safer.</i>

777
01:18:16.959 --> 01:18:18.584
<i>I believed in her.</i>

778
01:18:19.918 --> 01:18:21.293
In her kindness.

779
01:18:25.293 --> 01:18:27.709
I believed in her
ability to save us.

780
01:19:17.501 --> 01:19:19.834
The great General Titus.

781
01:19:23.543 --> 01:19:24.543
Thank you.

782
01:19:26.293 --> 01:19:27.126
Okay.

783
01:19:28.668 --> 01:19:29.668
Oof.

784
01:19:33.418 --> 01:19:34.959
Are you sure this
is a good idea?

785
01:19:35.668 --> 01:19:37.626
Let's clean him up
and get him sober.

786
01:19:37.709 --> 01:19:40.001
- Yeah, that'll do it.
- Come on.

787
01:19:40.543 --> 01:19:42.103
- Come on.
- You got him.

788
01:19:42.168 --> 01:19:44.668
- Come on.
- Get off me!

789
01:20:01.626 --> 01:20:03.334
What do you think you're doing?

790
01:20:04.126 --> 01:20:06.251
That's enough. Thank you.

791
01:20:17.084 --> 01:20:19.501
Did you command the Eastern
ranks for the Old King?

792
01:20:21.334 --> 01:20:24.584
Are you not General
Titus? A legend.

793
01:20:25.126 --> 01:20:27.584
I don't know what you're
running your mouth about.

794
01:20:28.543 --> 01:20:30.459
Why can't you just
leave me alone?

795
01:20:34.668 --> 01:20:39.418
Because my best hope is that long-ago
general is still in front of me.

796
01:20:44.459 --> 01:20:45.918
What do you want from me?

797
01:20:46.001 --> 01:20:48.501
My men are dead because
of my surrender.

798
01:20:49.543 --> 01:20:52.918
I'm tired of reliving
that nightmare every day.

799
01:20:53.918 --> 01:20:57.001
Now, please, leave me
and let me die in peace.

800
01:21:03.168 --> 01:21:05.293
I don't think you're
meant to die here…

801
01:21:06.626 --> 01:21:07.459
General.

802
01:21:07.543 --> 01:21:08.626
Stop calling me that.

803
01:21:09.209 --> 01:21:10.543
I have no rank, no privilege.

804
01:21:10.626 --> 01:21:12.459
I'm here to make you an offer.

805
01:21:12.543 --> 01:21:14.293
To give you a chance
at redemption.

806
01:21:14.376 --> 01:21:18.251
- I am beyond redemption.
- I have no time for pity!

807
01:21:18.334 --> 01:21:21.251
What about all the dead
men you once commanded?

808
01:21:21.334 --> 01:21:22.751
What about them?

809
01:21:24.626 --> 01:21:26.209
If not redemption,

810
01:21:27.459 --> 01:21:29.126
what about revenge?

811
01:22:38.543 --> 01:22:40.584
This is the man who knows
where the insurgents are?

812
01:22:41.501 --> 01:22:42.501
It is, sir.

813
01:22:43.793 --> 01:22:46.168
Well, I'm listening.

814
01:22:47.751 --> 01:22:49.793
You'll let me go if I
tell you what I know?

815
01:22:49.876 --> 01:22:51.709
I'll set you free,
you have my word.

816
01:22:53.668 --> 01:22:56.709
I haven't seen Devra
Bloodaxe for a full season,

817
01:22:56.793 --> 01:23:00.543
but at the time they were on Sharaan,
under the protection of a king called…

818
01:23:03.543 --> 01:23:04.543
Levitica.

819
01:23:06.793 --> 01:23:07.793
Go on.

820
01:23:08.709 --> 01:23:10.918
This was some time ago, but
they were definitely there.

821
01:23:13.126 --> 01:23:15.418
Talk to him, to Levitica.

822
01:23:16.751 --> 01:23:19.251
I certainly will. Thank you.

823
01:23:31.334 --> 01:23:32.876
Thought we had a deal!

824
01:23:32.959 --> 01:23:33.959
Yes, we did.

825
01:23:38.543 --> 01:23:39.876
You're free.

826
01:23:49.501 --> 01:23:52.834
Dissect his brain and see if
we can find out any more information.

827
01:23:54.376 --> 01:23:56.751
Then we'll go pay our
respects to King Levitica.

828
01:23:57.668 --> 01:24:00.084
Yes, Admiral. I'll
set a course for Sharaan.

829
01:24:02.876 --> 01:24:03.876
Let's go.

830
01:24:30.043 --> 01:24:34.834
Your patience is
appreciated and I can assure you…

831
01:24:35.418 --> 01:24:38.418
…Devra is aware
of your presence.

832
01:24:39.084 --> 01:24:44.918
A decision when to
receive you is imminent.

833
01:24:47.293 --> 01:24:51.084
Thank you, Levitica,
honored king.

834
01:24:55.126 --> 01:24:57.334
We await their arrival.

835
01:25:07.543 --> 01:25:09.263
Look.

836
01:26:10.918 --> 01:26:15.834
Farmer, why would you contact us from
this unknown and flagless vessel?

837
01:26:15.918 --> 01:26:20.001
I was assuming we had a level
of trust after our last meeting.

838
01:26:20.084 --> 01:26:22.834
We bought your grain
to feed our fighters.

839
01:26:23.418 --> 01:26:27.584
Do not confuse your business of commerce
with our business of revolution.

840
01:26:27.668 --> 01:26:29.168
I understand.

841
01:26:29.251 --> 01:26:33.501
Your coming here is a great risk
to us all and to our benefactor.

842
01:26:33.584 --> 01:26:36.209
But we are no longer
in need of your grain.

843
01:26:36.293 --> 01:26:39.334
King Levitica's kindness has been
more than enough to sustain us,

844
01:26:39.418 --> 01:26:42.084
so I suggest you
leave immediately.

845
01:26:42.168 --> 01:26:44.001
We're not
here to sell grain.

846
01:26:44.084 --> 01:26:46.126
Gunnar's village was
visited by a Dreadnought

847
01:26:46.209 --> 01:26:48.251
that threatens its
very existence.

848
01:26:48.334 --> 01:26:49.918
I have recruited these warriors

849
01:26:50.001 --> 01:26:52.959
and given my word to bring them
back and defend the farmers.

850
01:26:53.043 --> 01:26:55.334
- But we're running out of time.
- What?

851
01:26:55.918 --> 01:26:58.668
This handful? Against
a Dreadnought?

852
01:26:58.751 --> 01:27:01.251
That's why we have come.
You have men and ships.

853
01:27:02.001 --> 01:27:03.959
With you we could
mount a real defense.

854
01:27:04.043 --> 01:27:09.001
And, of course, we can pay you
with the surplus from our harvest.

855
01:27:10.751 --> 01:27:11.918
It's all we've got.

856
01:27:12.001 --> 01:27:14.168
My forces
against the King's Gaze?

857
01:27:14.251 --> 01:27:15.293
That's suicide.

858
01:27:15.876 --> 01:27:18.459
That ship cannot be destroyed
by a few dozen fighters.

859
01:27:19.001 --> 01:27:23.209
That ship and the men aboard
it are world destroyers.

860
01:27:23.293 --> 01:27:25.626
I'm sorry, it's impossible.

861
01:27:25.709 --> 01:27:27.876
This man is
not a revolutionary.

862
01:27:27.959 --> 01:27:29.709
He's a simple farmer.

863
01:27:29.793 --> 01:27:31.126
But commerce or not,

864
01:27:31.209 --> 01:27:35.043
his people toiled with their bare
hands to grow the grain that fed you.

865
01:27:35.126 --> 01:27:36.126
All of you!

866
01:27:36.584 --> 01:27:38.584
And because of that transaction,

867
01:27:38.668 --> 01:27:41.418
their village is now
threatened by Admiral Noble,

868
01:27:41.501 --> 01:27:44.334
in pursuit of <i>your </i>revolution.

869
01:28:06.043 --> 01:28:07.043
I see.

870
01:28:12.251 --> 01:28:13.251
I will go.

871
01:28:15.459 --> 01:28:16.459
Thank you.

872
01:28:16.834 --> 01:28:18.709
Brother, a word.

873
01:28:27.001 --> 01:28:31.834
Our victories, what few there have
been, have been tactical ones.

874
01:28:31.918 --> 01:28:34.168
We cannot fight in the open
against the King's Gaze.

875
01:28:34.251 --> 01:28:38.084
If the farmer found us, it
won't be long before Noble does.

876
01:28:38.834 --> 01:28:43.834
And I will not allow another
world to fall in our name.

877
01:28:46.959 --> 01:28:48.626
And what of those you command?

878
01:28:51.584 --> 01:28:53.126
Their
lives are theirs.

879
01:28:56.334 --> 01:28:57.543
Hmm.

880
01:29:10.709 --> 01:29:14.293
These people, they've
come to us with

881
01:29:15.084 --> 01:29:16.709
nowhere else to turn.

882
01:29:17.793 --> 01:29:19.001
They come…

883
01:29:19.668 --> 01:29:21.043
…seeking our help…

884
01:29:22.126 --> 01:29:25.543
…to stand against a
Dreadnought of the Motherworld.

885
01:29:27.043 --> 01:29:29.168
Is that not what we stand for?

886
01:29:31.418 --> 01:29:34.751
Are they not who we once were?

887
01:29:39.293 --> 01:29:42.751
If we will not stand with these
defiant farmers to protect their home,

888
01:29:43.334 --> 01:29:45.793
then the revolution
is meaningless.

889
01:29:47.834 --> 01:29:48.918
Under free will,

890
01:29:49.584 --> 01:29:52.959
who among you is willing
to die for what we believe

891
01:29:53.959 --> 01:29:55.751
rather than hide behind it?

892
01:30:12.168 --> 01:30:13.251
Milius.

893
01:30:14.584 --> 01:30:15.876
Why am I not surprised?

894
01:30:16.459 --> 01:30:20.584
Who is going to make sure you'll
return in one piece, if not me?

895
01:30:40.751 --> 01:30:43.418
Thank Levitica and
leave this planet.

896
01:30:48.251 --> 01:30:50.668
Sister, until we meet again.

897
01:30:59.543 --> 01:31:01.418
Maybe this isn't
suicide after all.

898
01:31:27.209 --> 01:31:28.876
Why would he agree to help you?

899
01:31:29.876 --> 01:31:33.084
Bloodaxe? You think
they shouldn't?

900
01:31:35.709 --> 01:31:37.209
It just seems short-sighted.

901
01:31:39.293 --> 01:31:41.168
I mean, he weakens
what little of

902
01:31:41.251 --> 01:31:43.626
whatever word you wanna
use for it there is…

903
01:31:44.418 --> 01:31:46.376
Resistance, insurgency.

904
01:31:47.334 --> 01:31:48.459
For what, Kora?

905
01:31:50.418 --> 01:31:52.751
The chance to get
obliterated by a Dreadnought?

906
01:31:53.293 --> 01:31:55.626
Guilt, it's a powerful thing.

907
01:31:56.334 --> 01:31:59.459
Aye, guilt. The
underbelly of honor.

908
01:32:00.751 --> 01:32:02.543
I think I might've
had that once.

909
01:32:03.834 --> 01:32:04.834
Honor.

910
01:32:05.751 --> 01:32:07.001
Would you believe that?

911
01:32:08.918 --> 01:32:09.918
It's true.

912
01:32:12.001 --> 01:32:13.459
I mean, what do you figure?

913
01:32:14.501 --> 01:32:19.959
I got ten, fifteen more seasons at
most, before I steal from the wrong man.

914
01:32:20.543 --> 01:32:24.918
Get stabbed to death by some dog-headed
son of a bitch in a bar fight.

915
01:32:27.543 --> 01:32:29.418
It's really your fault, anyway.

916
01:32:30.501 --> 01:32:32.751
Makin' me wanna be
an honorable man.

917
01:32:33.668 --> 01:32:35.834
If you had more resisting
power to speak of,

918
01:32:35.918 --> 01:32:38.084
you wouldn't need me
to join you so badly.

919
01:32:39.834 --> 01:32:41.459
You're willing to fight with us?

920
01:32:42.418 --> 01:32:43.584
Since you're beggin'.

921
01:32:44.834 --> 01:32:47.209
Kai, we're not.

922
01:32:47.834 --> 01:32:49.334
Well, since you're asking, then.

923
01:32:50.001 --> 01:32:51.251
If you'll allow me.

924
01:32:51.959 --> 01:32:52.959
Wow.

925
01:32:56.376 --> 01:32:57.834
There is one complication.

926
01:32:58.501 --> 01:33:00.084
The shite in the cargo hold.

927
01:33:00.876 --> 01:33:02.584
I got buyers
waiting in Gondival.

928
01:33:03.084 --> 01:33:05.501
Aren't the kinds known
for their patience.

929
01:33:05.584 --> 01:33:07.876
Might be wise to sever my
ties to life as a thief

930
01:33:07.959 --> 01:33:10.459
before we go picking a
fight with a Dreadnought.

931
01:33:11.043 --> 01:33:14.209
Besides, you said
yourself you need me.

932
01:33:16.168 --> 01:33:18.418
- I did not say that.
- I think you did.

933
01:33:18.501 --> 01:33:20.834
I'll set the course and let
'em know we're on our way.

934
01:33:20.918 --> 01:33:23.334
Oh, shit, does that make
me one of the good guys?

935
01:33:30.543 --> 01:33:31.918
I beg you…

936
01:33:34.126 --> 01:33:35.126
Please!

937
01:33:36.584 --> 01:33:38.084
I've told you the truth.

938
01:33:39.668 --> 01:33:41.501
I have nothing more.

939
01:33:43.584 --> 01:33:44.626
Right.

940
01:33:44.709 --> 01:33:46.001
The truth…

941
01:33:47.376 --> 01:33:50.209
…that you took them in, known
enemies of the Motherworld,

942
01:33:51.126 --> 01:33:54.001
mended their wounds,
repaired their broken ships,

943
01:33:54.084 --> 01:33:57.334
all out of your moral
code of honor and charity.

944
01:33:57.418 --> 01:34:02.709
Our civilization has lived
and thrived for 10,000 years

945
01:34:02.793 --> 01:34:07.793
with honor and charity as
its most valued tenets.

946
01:34:07.876 --> 01:34:10.584
Yes. Yes, honor and charity.

947
01:34:13.251 --> 01:34:14.251
Do you see that?

948
01:34:17.543 --> 01:34:19.459
That ship is named
the King's Gaze.

949
01:34:20.251 --> 01:34:22.251
It was named to honor
our slain father.

950
01:34:25.293 --> 01:34:26.293
So…

951
01:34:28.126 --> 01:34:29.459
honor I understand.

952
01:34:32.959 --> 01:34:34.251
Charity, I do not.

953
01:34:35.418 --> 01:34:38.418
Our King showed charity to
an off-worlder like yourself

954
01:34:38.501 --> 01:34:40.376
and was slaughtered
for his charity.

955
01:34:41.084 --> 01:34:45.793
So, we named the ship to remind us
of the power in that benevolent gaze

956
01:34:45.876 --> 01:34:48.293
that was lost to charity.

957
01:34:49.626 --> 01:34:54.293
And to remember that, if by God's will,
that gaze should fall upon us and be held,

958
01:34:55.793 --> 01:34:57.501
for even the
briefest of moments,

959
01:34:59.001 --> 01:35:01.001
it could change
your life forever.

960
01:35:03.084 --> 01:35:04.584
Today, it falls upon you.

961
01:35:20.418 --> 01:35:22.209
We are cleared to engage.

962
01:35:22.293 --> 01:35:24.084
Confirmed.

963
01:35:24.668 --> 01:35:25.668
Fire at will.

964
01:35:31.043 --> 01:35:34.793
Sir, we received a
message from one of our Hawkshaws.

965
01:35:35.501 --> 01:35:37.626
They're closing in
on the Bloodaxes.

966
01:35:38.876 --> 01:35:39.876
Ah.

967
01:35:40.918 --> 01:35:42.584
Finally, some good news.

968
01:35:43.709 --> 01:35:45.334
Well, prepare the hyperlaunch.

969
01:35:45.418 --> 01:35:48.543
I'll go ahead and personally
retrieve the treasonous dogs myself.

970
01:35:55.668 --> 01:35:57.751
And what orders for
the King's Gaze, sir?

971
01:35:58.334 --> 01:36:00.376
Well, once you've
razed the planet,

972
01:36:00.459 --> 01:36:04.334
we'll rendezvous, extract the exact
location of the rest of the insurgents,

973
01:36:04.918 --> 01:36:06.876
and destroy them
once and for all.

974
01:36:06.959 --> 01:36:07.793
Yes, sir.

975
01:37:00.293 --> 01:37:02.168
I'm pretty sure
Kai said these boxes.

976
01:37:02.834 --> 01:37:04.543
- We've got one.
- Okay.

977
01:37:04.626 --> 01:37:06.043
Aye, just take the gray ones.

978
01:37:06.126 --> 01:37:07.459
- They're all marked.
- All right.

979
01:37:07.543 --> 01:37:11.126
For God's sake, don't look inside.
I'd hate you to think less of me.

980
01:37:15.834 --> 01:37:16.834
Ho!

981
01:37:19.376 --> 01:37:20.543
Where do you want them?

982
01:37:20.626 --> 01:37:22.918
- There's space behind the bridge.
- Done.

983
01:37:24.876 --> 01:37:26.876
All right, put them the
other side of the bridge.

984
01:37:29.918 --> 01:37:32.543
Aye, let's unload and get
off this godforsaken rock.

985
01:37:33.126 --> 01:37:35.001
I'll be happy to leave
this life behind.

986
01:37:35.668 --> 01:37:36.668
Good.

987
01:37:44.459 --> 01:37:47.043
Just wanna make sure
that one's on the manifest.

988
01:37:58.709 --> 01:37:59.709
Pilots!

989
01:38:00.376 --> 01:38:03.751
Once you tie off those ships,
see if you can get some fuel.

990
01:38:07.168 --> 01:38:10.834
And you two, keep
eyes from above!

991
01:38:32.834 --> 01:38:33.959
How we lookin'?

992
01:38:34.793 --> 01:38:35.876
Everything is done.

993
01:38:37.751 --> 01:38:39.918
- All right, let's move.
- Yes.

994
01:38:41.043 --> 01:38:42.709
On your mark.

995
01:38:44.584 --> 01:38:45.709
This isn't right.

996
01:39:39.668 --> 01:39:40.834
On your knees.

997
01:39:45.793 --> 01:39:47.668
Now is not the
time to be a hero.

998
01:39:58.418 --> 01:39:59.418
When?

999
01:40:00.668 --> 01:40:04.459
On Veldt, in Providence,
the first time I heard your story.

1000
01:40:05.459 --> 01:40:09.543
Thought with your ideals of resistance
I could round up a couple of heads.

1001
01:40:09.626 --> 01:40:11.376
Tarak for instance.

1002
01:40:12.126 --> 01:40:13.959
His world enslaved.

1003
01:40:15.209 --> 01:40:16.584
Then there was Nemesis.

1004
01:40:17.709 --> 01:40:19.334
Her whole family slaughtered.

1005
01:40:20.709 --> 01:40:22.293
But General Titus?

1006
01:40:23.334 --> 01:40:26.751
Have you any idea how
much he alone is worth?

1007
01:40:27.959 --> 01:40:29.543
They would've all
jumped at the chance

1008
01:40:29.626 --> 01:40:31.959
to exact any small
vengeance against the Realm.

1009
01:40:33.334 --> 01:40:35.918
Even if the payment was
only a sack of grain.

1010
01:40:39.084 --> 01:40:42.334
Then there was you. Kora.

1011
01:40:43.959 --> 01:40:46.168
Or should I call you Arthelais?

1012
01:40:47.501 --> 01:40:49.626
The biggest prize of them all.

1013
01:40:51.834 --> 01:40:54.334
Do you know what the
Motherworld did to my planet?

1014
01:40:54.918 --> 01:40:57.043
They didn't just destroy it.

1015
01:40:58.793 --> 01:41:02.209
They tortured every
man, woman, and child.

1016
01:41:04.084 --> 01:41:08.543
Left them clingin' to life as they
turned them to ash from low orbit.

1017
01:41:10.293 --> 01:41:11.834
You know what that taught me?

1018
01:41:13.293 --> 01:41:16.501
Never set foot on the
wrong side of history.

1019
01:41:16.584 --> 01:41:18.543
Is that what
you think we're doing?

1020
01:41:19.668 --> 01:41:20.668
No.

1021
01:41:20.709 --> 01:41:24.168
You've chosen the side that doesn't
even make it to the history books.

1022
01:41:25.293 --> 01:41:26.793
What happened to honor?

1023
01:41:27.418 --> 01:41:29.043
What did happen to it?

1024
01:41:30.334 --> 01:41:31.709
Piece of shit.

1025
01:41:39.709 --> 01:41:41.293
Well, who all have we got here?

1026
01:41:44.126 --> 01:41:45.126
Who indeed?

1027
01:41:46.834 --> 01:41:47.834
Commander Bloodaxe.

1028
01:41:49.251 --> 01:41:50.626
Leader of the very insurgency

1029
01:41:50.709 --> 01:41:54.043
the King's Gaze was sent to this
backwater of the galaxy to capture.

1030
01:41:54.543 --> 01:41:56.876
He alone will secure
my seat in the Senate.

1031
01:41:58.376 --> 01:42:02.501
I would be remiss if I failed to mention
we are in the presence of royalty.

1032
01:42:03.584 --> 01:42:05.293
Tarak Decimus.

1033
01:42:05.376 --> 01:42:08.168
Or should I say
Prince Tarak?

1034
01:42:09.251 --> 01:42:10.251
General Titus.

1035
01:42:11.001 --> 01:42:12.751
Needs no introduction, does he?

1036
01:42:12.834 --> 01:42:16.001
His actions at the Battle
of Sarawu precede him.

1037
01:42:17.918 --> 01:42:19.043
The farmer.

1038
01:42:21.584 --> 01:42:22.918
The ambitious farmer.

1039
01:42:24.001 --> 01:42:26.376
I pride myself on
never being surprised.

1040
01:42:27.251 --> 01:42:28.418
And yet, here I am.

1041
01:42:29.876 --> 01:42:33.501
I understand why all of
them are here… but you.

1042
01:42:34.793 --> 01:42:39.293
What could you have possibly hoped to
gain by mounting such a… feeble stand?

1043
01:42:40.334 --> 01:42:41.334
Tell me.

1044
01:42:45.209 --> 01:42:46.459
Oh, yes.

1045
01:42:53.876 --> 01:42:57.584
The legendary swordswoman known
only by the name of Nemesis.

1046
01:42:58.959 --> 01:43:02.251
Assassinated 16 high-ranking
Imperial officers

1047
01:43:02.334 --> 01:43:04.043
and their security details.

1048
01:43:05.168 --> 01:43:08.959
All in a hunt to avenge
her slaughtered children.

1049
01:43:09.876 --> 01:43:10.876
Oh…

1050
01:43:31.751 --> 01:43:32.751
Of course.

1051
01:43:36.751 --> 01:43:38.834
Now I thought I recognized
something in you,

1052
01:43:39.543 --> 01:43:40.834
down in that filthy village.

1053
01:43:41.501 --> 01:43:43.376
Out there, amongst all
those simple people,

1054
01:43:45.251 --> 01:43:48.043
the most wanted fugitive
in the known universe.

1055
01:43:50.126 --> 01:43:53.501
Scargiver. Arthelais.

1056
01:43:54.126 --> 01:43:57.376
Do you know what you've done
for me, Arthelais, truly?

1057
01:43:58.626 --> 01:44:00.293
Assembling yourself as such?

1058
01:44:01.959 --> 01:44:04.209
When I lay your bodies at
the foot of the Regent,

1059
01:44:04.876 --> 01:44:06.751
I'll be a hero of the Realm.

1060
01:44:07.334 --> 01:44:09.334
They'll write songs of
my feats of courage.

1061
01:44:10.543 --> 01:44:12.334
It's not like I didn't
do all the work.

1062
01:44:13.751 --> 01:44:15.459
Let's move this along, shall we?

1063
01:44:15.543 --> 01:44:19.293
Let's transport them paralyzed,
in case anyone's feeling frisky.

1064
01:44:20.584 --> 01:44:22.918
On your feet. I've
got a job for you.

1065
01:44:25.584 --> 01:44:27.793
Look… Okay, okay.

1066
01:44:41.959 --> 01:44:45.293
You play your cards right, you at
least might make it out of this alive.

1067
01:44:45.376 --> 01:44:46.668
You're sick.

1068
01:44:46.751 --> 01:44:48.084
And you're a coward.

1069
01:44:53.459 --> 01:44:55.626
All you have to
do is pull the trigger.

1070
01:44:57.876 --> 01:44:58.918
I won't do it.

1071
01:44:59.001 --> 01:45:00.251
Yes, you will.

1072
01:45:02.959 --> 01:45:05.959
You can do it. Just
pull the trigger.

1073
01:45:15.376 --> 01:45:18.209
I know you're in love with her.

1074
01:45:18.918 --> 01:45:19.959
Kora.

1075
01:45:20.043 --> 01:45:22.293
Gunnar.

1076
01:45:26.959 --> 01:45:28.168
I'm so sorry.

1077
01:45:28.251 --> 01:45:29.334
You can do it.

1078
01:46:36.626 --> 01:46:39.126
Pilots! To your ships!

1079
01:47:15.376 --> 01:47:16.959
Cut me
loose! We gotta go!

1080
01:49:17.501 --> 01:49:19.668
No!

1081
01:53:46.959 --> 01:53:48.209
This is perfect.

1082
01:54:46.418 --> 01:54:48.001
They gave their lives for us.

1083
01:54:52.459 --> 01:54:53.918
They believed in their cause.

1084
01:54:56.459 --> 01:54:58.251
What better thing to die for?

1085
01:55:01.584 --> 01:55:03.376
And I should have
died with them.

1086
01:55:07.001 --> 01:55:09.626
I know a thing or two about

1087
01:55:09.709 --> 01:55:14.043
the guilt of carrying on when those
you've sworn to fight with are gone.

1088
01:55:15.459 --> 01:55:16.459
Honor them.

1089
01:55:18.001 --> 01:55:20.084
With everything that
you can from now.

1090
01:55:22.418 --> 01:55:23.418
Carry them.

1091
01:55:50.334 --> 01:55:54.334
This was a blow to the
Motherworld, what we did this day.

1092
01:55:55.959 --> 01:56:00.334
Criminals, nobodies, standing
against a machine of war.

1093
01:56:01.751 --> 01:56:05.918
This small act of defiance
gives voice to the voiceless.

1094
01:56:06.709 --> 01:56:11.126
This is more than just a fallen
prick officer and some of his men.

1095
01:56:11.834 --> 01:56:13.834
It's the beginning of something.

1096
01:56:15.334 --> 01:56:16.501
What will they do now?

1097
01:56:17.126 --> 01:56:20.043
The crews of the Imperium are
not known for their bravery.

1098
01:56:21.168 --> 01:56:24.626
After the death of an admiral,
protocol will demand the ship's return.

1099
01:56:24.709 --> 01:56:25.709
That's good.

1100
01:56:26.709 --> 01:56:28.501
We still get paid, I presume?

1101
01:56:29.334 --> 01:56:30.709
A deal is a deal.

1102
01:56:32.251 --> 01:56:33.918
Payment awaits us on Veldt.

1103
01:56:37.459 --> 01:56:40.793
I owe you thanks, Gunnar. You
know, I never did trust that pilot.

1104
01:56:41.626 --> 01:56:42.918
We all owe him thanks.

1105
01:56:44.751 --> 01:56:45.876
He saved us.

1106
01:57:42.043 --> 01:57:43.168
I've been wondering.

1107
01:57:43.918 --> 01:57:46.334
Is what that dead
bounty hunter said true?

1108
01:57:47.043 --> 01:57:48.959
That you're Arthelais?

1109
01:57:50.084 --> 01:57:53.251
Kai was a liar and a thief who
nearly sold you all for a profit.

1110
01:57:54.751 --> 01:57:56.543
Anything more you want, General?

1111
01:57:58.168 --> 01:57:59.293
Don't call me General.

1112
01:58:00.668 --> 01:58:02.334
Hey, you see it?

1113
01:58:03.709 --> 01:58:04.709
There.

1114
01:58:08.418 --> 01:58:09.459
That's our village.

1115
01:58:11.251 --> 01:58:12.251
Home.

1116
01:58:12.626 --> 01:58:13.626
Home.

1117
01:58:14.418 --> 01:58:16.376
I never had a place
to put to the word.

1118
01:58:19.084 --> 01:58:21.918
It's almost a shame you killed
that son-of-a-bitch Noble

1119
01:58:22.001 --> 01:58:23.376
and we don't have to fight.

1120
01:58:25.876 --> 01:58:28.126
This would've been a
beautiful place to die.

1121
01:58:37.001 --> 01:58:38.001
Yes, it would.

1122
01:58:43.709 --> 01:58:44.709
Let's go.

1123
01:59:54.168 --> 01:59:56.251
Ready
him for transmission.

1124
01:59:56.334 --> 01:59:58.459
Balisarius is standing by.

1125
01:59:59.876 --> 02:00:02.376
Sir, should
we stabilize him first?

1126
02:00:02.876 --> 02:00:06.126
No, we will
not keep the Regent waiting.

1127
02:00:14.751 --> 02:00:15.751
Neurolink.

1128
02:00:19.001 --> 02:00:21.334
Link is established.

1129
02:00:37.334 --> 02:00:39.084
Connection complete.

1130
02:00:39.918 --> 02:00:41.168
Signal is strong.

1131
02:01:05.918 --> 02:01:06.959
Send him.

1132
02:01:39.668 --> 02:01:40.668
Master.

1133
02:01:42.043 --> 02:01:43.168
Balisarius.

1134
02:01:44.126 --> 02:01:45.584
I have found her.

1135
02:01:46.834 --> 02:01:48.584
I have found Arthelais.

1136
02:01:49.334 --> 02:01:50.668
The Scargiver.

1137
02:01:52.251 --> 02:01:54.668
- You're certain it's her?
- I am, my Lord.

1138
02:01:55.251 --> 02:01:58.584
She was in the company of the disgraced
General Titus and Darrian Bloodaxe.

1139
02:01:59.334 --> 02:02:01.126
We are close to capturing them.

1140
02:02:01.209 --> 02:02:06.376
Tell me, Commander. Did you think
that this would be good news?

1141
02:02:07.043 --> 02:02:09.001
That my daughter, Arthelais,

1142
02:02:09.584 --> 02:02:12.084
one of the most dangerous
and decorated warriors

1143
02:02:12.168 --> 02:02:17.793
in the history of armed conflict, is
now part of a blossoming insurgency?

1144
02:02:19.126 --> 02:02:20.626
I'm supposed to be happy

1145
02:02:20.709 --> 02:02:26.001
that she's joined forces with the genius
battlefield commander, General Titus?

1146
02:02:28.459 --> 02:02:30.084
Sir, she is within our grasp.

1147
02:02:32.168 --> 02:02:33.584
Let me bring you her head.

1148
02:02:40.334 --> 02:02:43.793
In truth, I fear the
head most endangered here is yours.

1149
02:02:45.584 --> 02:02:49.543
You will crush this insurgency
to the last man, do you hear me?

1150
02:02:50.918 --> 02:02:53.418
And then you will
capture my daughter alive

1151
02:02:54.293 --> 02:02:56.876
and bring back my
precious child to me.

1152
02:03:00.043 --> 02:03:03.251
So that I may crucify her
in the shadow of the Senate.

1153
02:03:03.834 --> 02:03:05.584
If you cannot bring her to me,

1154
02:03:07.126 --> 02:03:09.168
then the one whose
public execution

1155
02:03:09.251 --> 02:03:12.293
will send shivers down the
spines of the senators,

1156
02:03:12.959 --> 02:03:17.126
and whose screams will
echo down its marbled halls

1157
02:03:18.418 --> 02:03:19.584
will be yours.

1158
02:03:42.626 --> 02:03:44.126
Did
he make it back?

1159
02:03:44.209 --> 02:03:46.043
I don't know.

1160
02:03:46.126 --> 02:03:48.209
I have no heartbeat
or brain function.

1161
02:03:48.793 --> 02:03:50.418
Hit
him with everything.
