POOR CREATURES

3
00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:55.579
Dad.

4
00:03:56.581 --> 00:03:57.884
Father!

5
00:04:01.043 --> 00:04:01.999
Dad.

6
00:04:04.038 --> 00:04:05.055
Daddy!

7
00:04:08.275 --> 00:04:11.400
Plenty of bodies without a spark of self-awareness

8
00:04:11.441 --> 00:04:14.224
from the brain or blood flow from the heart.

9
00:04:14.225 --> 00:04:21.885
Butcher's platter for Sunday lunch.
Who wouldn't want to restore the organs?

10
00:04:21.886 --> 00:04:26.816
And who can tell a man from an animal?
Is there any difference?

11
00:04:30.318 --> 00:04:34.474
Oh, come on, come on!
Did you solve puzzles as a child? Or didn't you?

12
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.423
Am I really the only one here who is hardly
to concentrate when this monster talks?

13
00:04:40.587 --> 00:04:43.297
He is an exceptional surgeon.
His research is innovative.

14
00:04:43.338 --> 00:04:45.842
This place was founded by his father.

15
00:04:45.843 --> 00:04:48.791
You're getting into an awkward
position, Mr. Max McCandles...

16
00:04:50.263 --> 00:04:53.399
The snob's physical proximity is hurting you.
It belittles your friend.

17
00:04:53.968 --> 00:04:55.225
He looks like a rat in a suit.

18
00:04:57.367 --> 00:05:00.761
Do you really think there's
the liver in there, sir?

19
00:05:01.373 --> 00:05:05.203
May I ask you why
not give the heart back, sir?

20
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.797
Because I enjoy it...

21
00:05:08.033 --> 00:05:12.282
Mr. Max McCandles, come in
to see me after the lecture.

22
00:05:18.106 --> 00:05:19.057
Your article.

23
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.405
Did you like him, sir?

24
00:05:21.493 --> 00:05:26.133
In science it is difficult to findintelligence,
that transcends mediocrity.

25
00:05:26.215 --> 00:05:29.433
- Thank you Lord.
- I need an assistant for this project.

26
00:05:29.434 --> 00:05:30.533
I would like to...

27
00:05:30.574 --> 00:05:33.018
- Are you a believer?
- Yes, I believe in God.

28
00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:34.274
Me or in the Godhead?

29
00:05:34.649 --> 00:05:35.949
- I believe you, unless this is some kind of joke.

30
00:05:36.086 --> 00:05:39.623
It's not a joke.I don't need my father's inheritance,
to do my research.

31
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.239
Tell me, have you thought about it,
about growing a beard, sir?

32
00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.577
- I'm going to look like a dog in a tie.
- Kids love dogs.

33
00:05:48.398 --> 00:05:50.937
- Just kidding...
- All right, come on.

34
00:06:17.756 --> 00:06:18.557
Oh, no!

35
00:06:21.282 --> 00:06:24.011
- Hey, beautiful.
- Be-ella.

36
00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:27.136
Bella, this is Mr. McCandles.

37
00:06:27.585 --> 00:06:28.895
Hi, Bella.

38
00:06:33.956 --> 00:06:35.545
- Blood.
- Blood.

39
00:06:35.546 --> 00:06:36.971
- Blood.
- Blood!

40
00:06:36.972 --> 00:06:40.271
- Blood.
- Yeah, it's okay, I'm fine.

41
00:06:44.674 --> 00:06:46.791
She is very cute even though she is retarded.

42
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.192
She had a brain injury.
I fixed it.

43
00:06:51.308 --> 00:06:54.670
Her mental age and her body
not yet fully synchronized.

44
00:06:54.987 --> 00:06:56.087
He is learning to talk.

45
00:06:56.246 --> 00:06:59.072
It is developing at an accelerated pace.

46
00:06:59.456 --> 00:07:01.534
She's beautiful.

47
00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:05.495
Its growth requires
careful attention.

48
00:07:05.618 --> 00:07:08.918
- Will you help me with her?
- It would be an honor.

49
00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:11.997
We! We!

50
00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:14.949
Yes, you're adorable. Bella.

51
00:07:16.138 --> 00:07:19.194
- We... I mean, she's...
- She thinks you're her boyfriend.

52
00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.298
Take care of her.

53
00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:20.572
Don't you like herring?

54
00:08:26.695 --> 00:08:29.425
I just like to talk.

55
00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:33.002
I've been feeling so great since this morning...

56
00:08:54.557 --> 00:08:56.512
Bella will talk.

57
00:08:56.692 --> 00:08:58.239
Only the dead love Bella.

58
00:08:58.846 --> 00:09:00.905
- Only the dead.
- Only the dead.

59
00:09:22.489 --> 00:09:25.413
Great, great, great!

60
00:09:27.088 --> 00:09:27.845
Dog!

61
00:09:29.319 --> 00:09:30.296
Dog!

62
00:09:32.212 --> 00:09:33.271
Dog!

63
00:09:36.353 --> 00:09:37.071
Dog.

64
00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:56.865
Bella learns 15 words a day.

65
00:09:58.398 --> 00:10:00.585
Coordination is unstable at best.

66
00:10:00.828 --> 00:10:03.149
However, there is a noticeable progress.

67
00:10:03.713 --> 00:10:07.416
Her hair grows an inch every two days.
I decided to write it down.

68
00:10:07.737 --> 00:10:09.488
Well done. You're good to go.

69
00:10:10.151 --> 00:10:11.128
See you tomorrow.

70
00:10:11.942 --> 00:10:14.300
Sir... Where does Bella come from?

71
00:10:15.472 --> 00:10:18.231
Your job is to collect data.

72
00:10:18.272 --> 00:10:20.985
If I find any progress,
I'll get back to you.

73
00:10:55.346 --> 00:11:02.379
And so, when they returned from the forest,
she met her mom and dad.

74
00:11:03.556 --> 00:11:07.758
That night they had the
dinner cake and fell asleep together.

75
00:11:08.702 --> 00:11:11.763
They were very happy to be together again.

76
00:11:15.157 --> 00:11:16.816
Are you my father, God?

77
00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.916
- I...
- Or you want to be.

78
00:11:20.788 --> 00:11:22.394
I don't know who I am.

79
00:11:23.564 --> 00:11:24.908
Who is my father then?

80
00:11:25.525 --> 00:11:26.282
Well?

81
00:11:27.063 --> 00:11:30.354
You're an orphan.
Your parents are dead.

82
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:34.371
And you killed my parents, God?

83
00:11:34.999 --> 00:11:38.226
No. They were my friends.

84
00:11:39.274 --> 00:11:41.785
They were brave adventurers.

85
00:11:43.051 --> 00:11:46.419
They died in a landslide in South America.

86
00:11:47.774 --> 00:11:52.762
They have crossed the boundaries of the unknown.
They gained eternal life but paid a high price.

87
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:55.712
But it's the only way to live, Bella.

88
00:11:57.081 --> 00:11:59.652
They sent you into my care.

89
00:12:02.431 --> 00:12:03.277
Deceased.

90
00:12:04.867 --> 00:12:06.781
I'm afraid so, my dear.

91
00:12:08.719 --> 00:12:09.912
Poor Bella.

92
00:12:12.002 --> 00:12:13.326
I love you God.

93
00:12:19.381 --> 00:12:20.493
Are you going to sleep here?

94
00:12:22.517 --> 00:12:23.434
No.

95
00:12:34.437 --> 00:12:36.924
Good night, dear Bella.

96
00:12:41.275 --> 00:12:42.997
- Here.
- Parents.

97
00:12:43.796 --> 00:12:45.146
Peru. Yes.

98
00:12:47.608 --> 00:12:49.881
Why do you keep writing in that book?

99
00:12:49.882 --> 00:12:51.944
I have to write down your daily diet.

100
00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:59.088
Until when?

101
00:13:04.837 --> 00:13:07.241
Tell Bella about other places.

102
00:13:08.004 --> 00:13:13.361
This is Lisbon, Portugal,
the south of France, the Alps,

103
00:13:18.179 --> 00:13:19.032
Australia.

104
00:13:19.434 --> 00:13:22.550
Distant and dangerous
to both humans and animals.

105
00:13:22.551 --> 00:13:24.466
Bella would like to see the world.

106
00:13:27.156 --> 00:13:28.215
I don't...

107
00:13:30.002 --> 00:13:30.670
Bella.

108
00:13:34.999 --> 00:13:38.624
Bella, I don't think we're allowed to go up there.

109
00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:55.149
Bella.

110
00:13:58.343 --> 00:13:59.214
Bella!

111
00:14:00.747 --> 00:14:01.929
Bella.

112
00:14:03.762 --> 00:14:05.432
Bella! It's dangerous.

113
00:14:46.007 --> 00:14:47.106
God!

114
00:14:48.901 --> 00:14:50.571
I want to go out.

115
00:14:51.486 --> 00:14:56.218
Out? I've got a job here, I've got to
sew up those severed fingers.

116
00:14:56.862 --> 00:14:58.379
Hey, come on, take me out, come on!

117
00:14:58.497 --> 00:15:00.696
Of course, as soon as it
 as soon as possible, we'll go.

118
00:15:01.222 --> 00:15:02.145
Yes, out.

119
00:15:02.688 --> 00:15:05.377
- Have you ever been outside?
- No.

120
00:15:05.465 --> 00:15:09.498
I've created the perfect one for Bella here,
a happy and safe world for Bella.

121
00:15:09.765 --> 00:15:10.212
No.

122
00:15:11.831 --> 00:15:13.908
- Bella...
- No! No! No! No!

123
00:15:16.492 --> 00:15:17.469
No!

124
00:15:17.699 --> 00:15:18.555
Bella.

125
00:15:45.143 --> 00:15:49.339
You know... in this world there is
so many things that can kill you, Bella.

126
00:15:49.442 --> 00:15:50.611
How am I gonna be dead?

127
00:15:50.744 --> 00:15:56.578
Snakes, chariots, birds with sharp
beaks, poisonous plants.

128
00:16:23.022 --> 00:16:23.872
Bella?

129
00:16:25.504 --> 00:16:26.173
Bella?

130
00:16:47.302 --> 00:16:49.501
Bella. See.

131
00:16:59.669 --> 00:17:00.466
I can.

132
00:17:00.974 --> 00:17:01.992
What?

133
00:17:14.885 --> 00:17:16.613
Why is the thumb divine?

134
00:17:21.362 --> 00:17:26.051
Once when I was
very young, my father put his thumbs in a little

135
00:17:26.133 --> 00:17:31.117
of the iron box to find out
to see if it can restore the bone growth cycle.

136
00:17:32.258 --> 00:17:36.261
It's painful enough for that,
to make you cry.

137
00:17:36.914 --> 00:17:39.723
I looked closely at the other fingers.

138
00:17:40.842 --> 00:17:42.748
And just by observing, I started

139
00:17:43.388 --> 00:17:46.608
notice how they are overcome
epidemiological factors.

140
00:17:47.782 --> 00:17:52.141
When he returned, he was surprised
that I was smiling.

141
00:17:54.379 --> 00:17:58.534
He was a man of unconventional thinking.

142
00:18:06.548 --> 00:18:08.137
It's time to go,

143
00:18:09.638 --> 00:18:11.713
a storm is coming.

144
00:18:16.321 --> 00:18:17.856
Why are you scaring her so much?

145
00:18:18.073 --> 00:18:20.946
It's an experiment and I have to control

146
00:18:21.028 --> 00:18:24.128
conditions, otherwise the results will not be clean.

147
00:18:36.775 --> 00:18:38.363
Halt! I want to go out!

148
00:18:38.612 --> 00:18:41.044
- No, Bella.
- Bella wants to eat ice cream.

149
00:18:41.554 --> 00:18:43.202
- No.
- But Bella wants it!

150
00:18:43.764 --> 00:18:46.709
My face. People are afraid of God.
They laugh at God.

151
00:18:47.157 --> 00:18:49.688
God loves you.
He likes that dog's face.

152
00:18:52.373 --> 00:18:53.094
That's right.

153
00:18:54.233 --> 00:18:55.520
- Stop the carriage!
- No...

154
00:18:58.664 --> 00:19:01.020
Not now? Or not - ever?

155
00:19:01.564 --> 00:19:02.724
Just no.

156
00:19:10.513 --> 00:19:12.173
No!

157
00:19:12.625 --> 00:19:15.231
- No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No!
- Bella!

158
00:19:17.313 --> 00:19:17.825
No!

159
00:19:21.915 --> 00:19:24.114
- Stop it, stop it.
- No, stop it! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No!

160
00:19:24.115 --> 00:19:26.601
No! No! No! No! No! No!

161
00:19:39.711 --> 00:19:41.339
Sorry, sweetheart.

162
00:19:43.745 --> 00:19:45.007
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

163
00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:17.725
What did you do to her? Why are you hiding her?

164
00:21:18.511 --> 00:21:20.629
If you don't tell me what it had
I'll go to the police.

165
00:21:23.488 --> 00:21:26.706
I'm telling you this because
it's your lucky day.

166
00:21:40.871 --> 00:21:43.753
(Bella's original body: The pregnant woman who committed suicide)

167
00:21:44.442 --> 00:21:48.272
Her body, though dead was
very close to life.

168
00:21:48.545 --> 00:21:53.046
A body with no sign of life has barely cooled.

169
00:21:54.065 --> 00:21:58.865
She didn't have a pulse, but an electrical
shock could revive her.

170
00:21:59.496 --> 00:22:00.601
But Bella...

171
00:22:02.108 --> 00:22:05.645
She didn't know about her life
nothing except that...

172
00:22:05.727 --> 00:22:09.560
hated him so much and so one
one day she decided to leave him forever.

173
00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:12.928
What would it be like if someone freed her

174
00:22:13.259 --> 00:22:16.132
from dark eternity,
that she chose for herself...?

175
00:22:16.624 --> 00:22:19.724
They'd send her to one of our

176
00:22:19.765 --> 00:22:23.146
shelters where there is no staff
or equipment?

177
00:22:23.868 --> 00:22:26.309
After all, in this Christian country

178
00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:29.001
suicide is tantamount to madness and crime.

179
00:22:29.313 --> 00:22:31.768
Who am I to
to decide her fate?

180
00:22:32.018 --> 00:22:36.009
Then I
But I realized something on my part.

181
00:22:36.133 --> 00:22:38.862
All my research has come to this.

182
00:22:38.863 --> 00:22:42.887
Fate brought me a corpse and a living child.

183
00:22:43.034 --> 00:22:43.888
Everything is governed by fate.

184
00:22:44.516 --> 00:22:45.637
What?

185
00:22:45.678 --> 00:22:49.160
Removing the brain from the child and its
subsequent transplantation into an adult.

186
00:22:49.161 --> 00:22:50.495
It was the work of God who raised the woman.

187
00:22:51.208 --> 00:22:51.986
Jesus.

188
00:23:44.127 --> 00:23:45.154
Does Bella know about this?

189
00:23:45.409 --> 00:23:47.812
- Bella knows nothing.
- You'd be relieved.

190
00:23:48.266 --> 00:23:53.190
Nothing too.
And you don't want Bella in the world?

191
00:26:30.023 --> 00:26:34.450
- Mrs. Prim, are you happy?
- Yes, I'm happy.

192
00:26:35.889 --> 00:26:37.973
You look bitter, but I'll fix it.

193
00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:40.543
Close your eyes.

194
00:26:42.776 --> 00:26:43.793
Oh... no!

195
00:26:44.168 --> 00:26:45.852
You'll be happy in a minute.

196
00:26:47.625 --> 00:26:49.700
She grabbed me by my pubic hair!

197
00:26:50.948 --> 00:26:51.844
Bella?

198
00:26:52.047 --> 00:26:54.872
Bella touched her genitals and
I have to share this with you. See.

199
00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:57.770
- What are you doing? No!
- Here.

200
00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:04.167
Bella. Bella, stop touching right now.

201
00:27:04.292 --> 00:27:05.055
Why?

202
00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:08.149
In polite society, it's just not done.

203
00:27:13.313 --> 00:27:14.369
Just don't do it!

204
00:27:23.786 --> 00:27:25.679
- It's a bad thing.
- What?

205
00:27:26.532 --> 00:27:31.983
My dad cut out my kidney, so
I've had toxin problems ever since.

206
00:27:32.952 --> 00:27:34.287
And why did he do it?

207
00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:36.863
He wanted to discover something that no one knew.

208
00:27:36.966 --> 00:27:39.403
Turns out we ideally need both.

209
00:27:41.232 --> 00:27:44.565
Bella, why aren't you eating?

210
00:27:45.877 --> 00:27:47.175
Don't do it.

211
00:27:55.512 --> 00:27:56.501
Good night.

212
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.448
You know, I'm actually a romantic, Max.

213
00:28:21.576 --> 00:28:22.514
What?

214
00:28:22.946 --> 00:28:25.245
I mean, between you
and Bella, I see love.

215
00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:28.210
You and Bella are in love with each other.

216
00:28:28.292 --> 00:28:30.207
Maybe you should marry her.

217
00:28:31.467 --> 00:28:33.300
- What?
- I think he loves you.

218
00:28:35.908 --> 00:28:40.919
More than once I have seen people who
looked at each other lovingly.

219
00:28:41.247 --> 00:28:42.965
And that's something I recognize.

220
00:28:44.064 --> 00:28:45.163
Is that right?

221
00:28:46.747 --> 00:28:50.943
Yes, I have feelings for her.

222
00:28:51.026 --> 00:28:52.533
So I can count on you?

223
00:28:53.145 --> 00:28:55.426
Take Bella out...

224
00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:56.838
No.

225
00:28:57.542 --> 00:28:58.311
No.

226
00:28:59.211 --> 00:28:59.983
I...

227
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:03.933
Do you feel that?

228
00:29:10.218 --> 00:29:11.400
Do it to Belle, too.

229
00:29:17.187 --> 00:29:21.749
I thought maybe that's why you were raising her,
to be your mistress one day.

230
00:29:21.832 --> 00:29:24.194
Black, unworthy thoughts, I know.

231
00:29:25.514 --> 00:29:28.976
So you didn't sleep with her?

232
00:29:29.955 --> 00:29:33.495
Because of a spinal cord injury I
I've maintained sexual homeostasis.

233
00:29:33.536 --> 00:29:38.307
I performed a nerve
higher-order stimulation.

234
00:29:38.308 --> 00:29:42.219
My pressure on the pancreas
changed the chemistry in my blood.

235
00:29:42.219 --> 00:29:45.805
Not for a few spasmodic minutes,
but for many days.

236
00:29:47.143 --> 00:29:47.900
What?

237
00:29:48.081 --> 00:29:50.328
I'm a eunuch, I have no sex drive!

238
00:29:50.778 --> 00:29:54.148
I would need to recharge
as much electricity as the North has

239
00:29:54.197 --> 00:29:57.638
London to provoke
a sexual response in my body.

240
00:29:57.949 --> 00:30:00.987
Besides, feelings for my father

241
00:30:01.069 --> 00:30:02.971
dampen my sexual thoughts as well.

242
00:30:04.915 --> 00:30:07.480
I apologise for my
dark thoughts.

243
00:30:07.562 --> 00:30:08.745
They were not dark!

244
00:30:08.745 --> 00:30:14.733
- All men are sexually anxious.
- Not all.

245
00:30:14.733 --> 00:30:16.471
Are you interested in marrying her
to marry her, yes or no?

246
00:30:18.075 --> 00:30:19.159
I want to marry you.

247
00:30:20.068 --> 00:30:20.983
Be my wife.

248
00:30:28.665 --> 00:30:30.873
We should touch
our genitals.

249
00:30:30.873 --> 00:30:37.673
No, no. I don't want to use you.
You're special. When the time comes...

250
00:30:44.317 --> 00:30:48.068
- What conditions does Bella have?
- I understand.

251
00:30:48.318 --> 00:30:55.079
So it has 2 conditions. Not to travel with her to
abroad and that you'll live here with us forever.

252
00:30:56.334 --> 00:31:00.240
I will prepare a legal agreement.

253
00:31:25.213 --> 00:31:27.781
- This is an unusual contract.
- There are spelling mistakes.

254
00:31:28.086 --> 00:31:32.277
This does not affect her
legal force, I assure you.

255
00:31:34.103 --> 00:31:37.902
She must be an extraordinary woman,
who deserves a contract like this.

256
00:31:42.908 --> 00:31:45.307
If you don't mind
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

257
00:31:46.758 --> 00:31:49.647
What you have five years
that you can't hold your urine?

258
00:31:49.871 --> 00:31:53.251
Just like my father before
and his father before him.

259
00:31:54.290 --> 00:31:56.695
You may have prostate cancer.

260
00:31:57.232 --> 00:31:58.026
Good advice.

261
00:33:01.998 --> 00:33:05.803
Let me guarantee that my
contract with you, Bella Baxter, is certain.

262
00:33:06.599 --> 00:33:08.567
Good afternoon,
have you come to visit us?

263
00:33:09.413 --> 00:33:12.627
- You want my hat?
- Will it fit me?

264
00:33:13.243 --> 00:33:14.324
Yes!

265
00:33:15.469 --> 00:33:17.345
How funny!

266
00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:22.446
I never thought I'd get
I could marry such an attractive woman.

267
00:33:22.895 --> 00:33:24.283
What are you talking about?

268
00:33:24.371 --> 00:33:26.741
"He must live here and not be allowed to
travel abroad.

269
00:33:26.823 --> 00:33:28.714
The undersigned, Mr. Max McCandle and Mr. Baxter.

270
00:33:28.795 --> 00:33:30.749
And also you must not go to town with them.

271
00:33:31.361 --> 00:33:32.332
I see.

272
00:33:33.742 --> 00:33:36.628
- They love me very much.
- I understand why.

273
00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:40.567
- But I had to see you with my own eyes.
- I don't understand!

274
00:33:43.415 --> 00:33:44.758
Who are you?

275
00:33:47.339 --> 00:33:49.244
Mr. Duncan Wedderburn.

276
00:34:30.745 --> 00:34:32.146
How did you get here?

277
00:34:34.117 --> 00:34:35.442
I climbed out.

278
00:34:53.502 --> 00:34:55.877
- Have you been looking at me for a long time?
- I don't think so.

279
00:34:56.517 --> 00:35:00.225
I hope you weren't watching,
how I've been working for my happiness.

280
00:35:00.497 --> 00:35:02.615
I know it's rude.

281
00:35:07.879 --> 00:35:13.746
I don't care about polite society.
It's very boring. It corrupts my soul.

282
00:35:14.278 --> 00:35:16.274
God doesn't think so.

283
00:35:17.689 --> 00:35:20.990
I think God himself invented it.

284
00:35:21.348 --> 00:35:22.372
Godwin Baxter.

285
00:35:23.128 --> 00:35:26.019
Bad dog. What's your story?

286
00:35:27.333 --> 00:35:29.992
You are a prisoner and I am the one who will set you free.

287
00:35:32.268 --> 00:35:37.605
I see in you a thirst for
for the experience of freedom, for touch.

288
00:35:37.687 --> 00:35:39.169
You want to experience something new.

289
00:35:40.357 --> 00:35:42.498
Why did I come, you asked me?
I will answer you.

290
00:35:43.759 --> 00:35:46.588
I'm going to Lisbon on Friday and
I'd like you to come with me.

291
00:35:47.061 --> 00:35:50.393
- Lisbon Portugal?
- Yes, I'm talking about Lisbon.

292
00:35:52.255 --> 00:35:53.965
God will never allow it.

293
00:35:55.984 --> 00:36:00.710
I won't ask him... I'm asking you.

294
00:36:02.667 --> 00:36:04.622
I don't think it's safe to be with you.

295
00:36:04.729 --> 00:36:08.012
Well, actually... Yes,

296
00:36:22.675 --> 00:36:25.708
Can you give me a moment of your time, God?

297
00:36:26.043 --> 00:36:27.044
Sure, Bella.

298
00:36:27.576 --> 00:36:29.673
I have important things to share with you.

299
00:36:30.253 --> 00:36:32.222
Bella got giddy with excitement.

300
00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:35.596
- What does it mean?
- Tonight at midnight...

301
00:36:36.203 --> 00:36:39.706
I'm secretly running away with my boyfriend.

302
00:36:39.788 --> 00:36:42.199
- What?
- You can't stop me.

303
00:36:42.281 --> 00:36:43.461
You bet I'll stop you!

304
00:36:43.665 --> 00:36:45.145
You're too hard on Bella.

305
00:36:45.956 --> 00:36:47.764
I want to loosen my bonds
and I'm gonna go to the ocean.

306
00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:53.316
You take Max and we'll travel.
You, me and Max, who you're engaged to.

307
00:36:53.317 --> 00:36:57.595
Marriage to Max...it's sure to be great.

308
00:36:57.596 --> 00:37:01.189
But first I'll make an adventure
with Duncan Wetterburn,

309
00:37:01.456 --> 00:37:08.999
I have a feeling it's gonna hurt me a little bit,
but it'll be interesting, too.

310
00:37:09.139 --> 00:37:10.634
I can't let you go.

311
00:37:17.195 --> 00:37:19.354
Kiss me and let me go.

312
00:37:20.022 --> 00:37:21.157
And if not...

313
00:37:21.611 --> 00:37:25.389
Bella's insides will rot with hatred.

314
00:37:25.767 --> 00:37:26.907
- Hate?
- Hate!

315
00:37:36.077 --> 00:37:37.560
Get those suitcases out, Brin.

316
00:37:38.258 --> 00:37:41.150
Godwin told me about your plan.
I don't blame you. Bella.

317
00:37:41.273 --> 00:37:43.003
The man's a cunning thief.

318
00:37:43.086 --> 00:37:46.060
He has a sneaky way of getting
to gain the trust of a naive woman.

319
00:37:46.142 --> 00:37:48.382
It was mostly his eyes on me.

320
00:37:48.709 --> 00:37:51.466
His hands whispered love to me
between my legs.

321
00:37:51.684 --> 00:37:56.083
It's the whisper of words I can't hear
but they set my body on fire.

322
00:37:56.084 --> 00:38:00.036
Oh, my God, Bella. We're engaged. I love you.

323
00:38:00.037 --> 00:38:01.702
When I get back, we'll get married.

324
00:38:02.034 --> 00:38:05.400
We'll be happy together like two doves on a branch.
Shall I take my travel hat with me?

325
00:38:05.582 --> 00:38:08.973
No, this won't work. Just stay.

326
00:38:09.914 --> 00:38:11.462
I'll talk to this man in person.

327
00:38:11.896 --> 00:38:15.300
I hit him in the face with my fist, he stays
...and it's just a pulp of blood and bone.

328
00:38:15.863 --> 00:38:17.043
Max, don't get so excited!

329
00:38:17.682 --> 00:38:20.059
Stop making yourself out to be Mad Max.

330
00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:23.669
I'm sorry, but I won't let
to be deceived by a man

331
00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:26.547
who has only the bad in mind
and is empty in heart.

332
00:38:26.995 --> 00:38:29.236
I'm gonna smash his fucking head in.

333
00:38:32.854 --> 00:38:33.994
What?

334
00:38:44.712 --> 00:38:46.708
Bella, please don't...

335
00:38:59.178 --> 00:39:04.853
Goodbye, my little pigeon.
See you after my big adventure.

336
00:39:06.431 --> 00:39:07.102
God.

337
00:39:47.472 --> 00:39:48.269
She left.

338
00:39:49.476 --> 00:39:54.243
Instead of breakfast, I started drinking.
It tastes so strange to me.

339
00:39:54.244 --> 00:39:55.873
Why didn't you stop her?

340
00:39:56.679 --> 00:39:58.467
It is a being with free will.

341
00:40:03.072 --> 00:40:06.798
- Now she's out there alone.
- She'll be fine.

342
00:40:06.881 --> 00:40:10.783
- I was crazy. I should have stopped her.
- We're just science people.

343
00:40:12.255 --> 00:40:15.759
This type of emotionality is unpleasant.

344
00:40:19.142 --> 00:40:21.300
I hope all is well with her.

345
00:40:42.546 --> 00:40:44.779
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.

346
00:40:45.587 --> 00:40:47.315
I'm not lying, I've been with many.

347
00:40:47.869 --> 00:40:51.128
The First Lady said,
you're a wolf and you smell like 100 women.

348
00:40:51.244 --> 00:40:52.629
He's definitely exaggerating.

349
00:40:53.534 --> 00:40:54.261
Good,

350
00:40:55.205 --> 00:40:57.040
Oysters. Have you ever tried them?

351
00:40:57.572 --> 00:40:58.631
Not yet.

352
00:41:03.314 --> 00:41:04.953
Swallow them in one gulp.

353
00:41:15.819 --> 00:41:17.366
Well done.

354
00:41:20.089 --> 00:41:21.596
I want more.

355
00:41:29.841 --> 00:41:34.657
LISABON

356
00:41:35.244 --> 00:41:37.857
Monks, nuns and stars of this city

357
00:41:37.898 --> 00:41:40.734
are like the egg and yolks in these buns.

358
00:41:40.979 --> 00:41:43.912
- But how do they eat them?
- Through their mouths, I suppose.

359
00:41:44.076 --> 00:41:49.751
They should not be eaten small
bits, but in mouthfuls, like life itself.

360
00:41:56.502 --> 00:42:00.454
This is incredible.
Who makes them? More for us.

361
00:42:00.538 --> 00:42:03.390
Never again. Just one.
More is too much.

362
00:42:04.261 --> 00:42:05.808
It's time for sleep.

363
00:42:05.809 --> 00:42:07.113
Why is sleep?

364
00:42:33.097 --> 00:42:37.212
How come people don't do it all the time?

365
00:42:39.071 --> 00:42:40.835
It's thoughtless of you, but...

366
00:42:40.919 --> 00:42:44.593
I spent 3 times more on you
money than I usually do.

367
00:42:44.814 --> 00:42:47.535
Not every guy would take you
would get to the top the way I did.

368
00:42:49.358 --> 00:42:50.393
I feel sorry for you.

369
00:42:51.903 --> 00:42:55.442
Because I love you so
we're gonna take a break for a while.

370
00:42:56.439 --> 00:42:59.351
"You're jumping wildly." I love it.

371
00:42:59.727 --> 00:43:02.977
I've already rested.
Let's do it again.

372
00:43:03.177 --> 00:43:07.856
Again?
Unfortunately, I have my limits too.

373
00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:10.818
Men can't just repeat that.

374
00:43:10.987 --> 00:43:15.236
Is it a physiological problem?
Weakness in men?

375
00:43:16.226 --> 00:43:17.366
Well...

376
00:43:20.056 --> 00:43:21.124
Probably.

377
00:43:22.898 --> 00:43:26.600
I advise you, it's not too late, don't fall in love with me.

378
00:43:27.443 --> 00:43:31.799
In terms of coherence, I don't have
nothing to offer but adventure.

379
00:43:32.222 --> 00:43:32.912
I understand.

380
00:43:34.901 --> 00:43:35.971
Go to sleep.

381
00:44:04.461 --> 00:44:05.560
Ma'am?

382
00:47:43.736 --> 00:47:44.958
Good evening, sir.

383
00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:47.989
Duncan Wedderburn.

384
00:47:48.153 --> 00:47:50.132
Bella, where have you been? You just disappeared.

385
00:47:50.779 --> 00:47:51.658
I didn't disappear.

386
00:47:52.802 --> 00:47:54.567
No one can just disappear.

387
00:47:55.162 --> 00:47:56.619
- What?
- Is that it?

388
00:47:56.911 --> 00:47:57.808
Disappear?

389
00:47:57.890 --> 00:48:00.700
What? Of course not.
What the hell are you talking about?

390
00:48:01.071 --> 00:48:02.211
Where have you been?

391
00:48:02.293 --> 00:48:05.465
I had a craving for cake and
and then something unusual happened.

392
00:48:05.941 --> 00:48:08.501
I didn't know how to go back...
I got lost.

393
00:48:09.108 --> 00:48:14.132
It's a city full of noise,
But it was a sweet, exciting and fascinating experience for Bella.

394
00:48:14.701 --> 00:48:16.069
It made my blood boil.

395
00:48:16.529 --> 00:48:18.199
Bella, it's dangerous to go out without me.

396
00:48:18.241 --> 00:48:21.187
I embarked on an adventure
and all I found was sugar and violence.

397
00:48:21.841 --> 00:48:24.324
It was very charming. I'm cool.

398
00:48:25.264 --> 00:48:29.000
Now I'm gonna lie down and you lie down
on top of me and we'll go wild again.

399
00:48:33.251 --> 00:48:38.955
Kitty, did you see Wilde's new play in London?
It was tremendous fun.

400
00:48:39.037 --> 00:48:42.179
I really liked it a lot.

401
00:48:46.412 --> 00:48:47.120
Bella.

402
00:48:48.624 --> 00:48:53.391
What? Why do I have to put it in my mouth,
when it's so disgusting?

403
00:48:54.113 --> 00:48:56.298
I said the same thing to Gerald once.

404
00:48:58.448 --> 00:49:00.916
You know what I mean.

405
00:49:01.421 --> 00:49:02.887
You were so gentle.

406
00:49:03.012 --> 00:49:05.538
Oh, I know you're talking about his penis.

407
00:49:07.276 --> 00:49:09.666
Duncan has it so salty sometimes.

408
00:49:13.117 --> 00:49:14.584
Oh, my God.

409
00:49:16.011 --> 00:49:17.732
I'm going to go slap that noisy kid.

410
00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:29.885
Your behavior is over the top.

411
00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:31.622
Behave!

412
00:49:31.829 --> 00:49:37.900
The food is bad, the baby is annoying and she
the woman bores me with her stupid talk.

413
00:49:37.989 --> 00:49:41.864
Go back to the table and
say no more than 3 phrases.

414
00:49:42.649 --> 00:49:47.578
"Fun" tasty" Or "That pastry is crispy."
Okay?

415
00:49:48.802 --> 00:49:51.302
- Are you aware that you're hurting Bella?
- I'm sorry.

416
00:49:52.183 --> 00:49:53.947
You're not in the picture.

417
00:49:54.354 --> 00:49:55.412
Let's go.

418
00:50:12.165 --> 00:50:14.773
Are you looking forward to Lisbon, Bella?

419
00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:17.954
Tasty.

420
00:50:19.923 --> 00:50:22.607
Kitty, how's your father?

421
00:50:22.898 --> 00:50:26.729
He's very sick.
I'm not sure if he will survive this year.

422
00:50:26.811 --> 00:50:30.392
How delicious it is.
How did you get that pastry so crispy?

423
00:50:49.399 --> 00:50:52.046
- My God!
- What is it?

424
00:50:53.289 --> 00:50:54.429
It's from Bella.

425
00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:03.215
"I'm fine. Lisbon.
Sweet cakes. I have sex every day."

426
00:51:04.934 --> 00:51:07.326
At least that's how it's written here,
it sounds like one sentence.

427
00:51:07.410 --> 00:51:08.756
- Do you think she had sex while doing it?
- Yeah, she did.

428
00:51:10.916 --> 00:51:13.849
And there's also a picture of a smoking train.

429
00:52:55.824 --> 00:52:58.612
Do you have a headache too, Duncan Wedderburn?

430
00:52:59.165 --> 00:53:03.040
- Wow, I'm starving.
- Where the hell have you been?

431
00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:08.133
Victoria Blessington?

432
00:53:09.698 --> 00:53:11.392
I haven't seen you in so long!

433
00:53:11.757 --> 00:53:17.828
Some time has passed...
My name is Bella Baxter, and I'm a single woman.

434
00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:20.476
I'm sorry, I got you confused,
I thought you were her.

435
00:53:25.662 --> 00:53:27.862
Well, shall we go somewhere to eat?

436
00:53:29.292 --> 00:53:36.300
Steaks, fish and caramel sauce,
pot roast, everything those old people eat there.

437
00:53:36.424 --> 00:53:38.110
Is it edible?

438
00:53:38.543 --> 00:53:42.536
Of course not. That's
for Bella. You order what you want.

439
00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:46.314
You're in charge
walks and adventures.

440
00:53:46.611 --> 00:53:49.978
We need to start with whimsy,
as Duncan Wedderburn said

441
00:53:50.019 --> 00:53:53.756
Belle Baxter on the first day of the Lisbon affair.

442
00:53:54.068 --> 00:53:55.249
Go on.

443
00:53:55.250 --> 00:53:57.898
Understand that I've never lived
outside of God's house.

444
00:53:57.980 --> 00:54:00.506
- What?
-" Bella is always discovering something new."

445
00:54:00.907 --> 00:54:06.611
And your sad face makes me
to discover feelings of anger towards you.

446
00:54:08.245 --> 00:54:15.009
That's right, I've become what I hate.
I'm just a clingy parasite lover.

447
00:54:16.385 --> 00:54:19.969
I've always cursed them and now I'm the same way.
Damn!

448
00:55:27.162 --> 00:55:30.218
You are like me, you are a free being.

449
00:55:33.351 --> 00:55:34.898
And a good dancer.

450
00:55:35.693 --> 00:55:40.052
The man winks at me repeatedly.
Bella winks back at him.

451
00:55:40.332 --> 00:55:41.921
That's our game.

452
00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:56.490
Let's have fun together, join us!

453
00:55:56.728 --> 00:55:59.010
I've never joined anyone before.

454
00:56:27.034 --> 00:56:31.108
- You're crazy.
- Shut up! Your noises make Bella angry.

455
00:56:31.109 --> 00:56:33.591
Don't talk nonsense, I have to sort this out.

456
00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:48.001
What is it supposed to be?

457
00:56:51.287 --> 00:56:53.019
A man taught me chess.

458
00:56:53.576 --> 00:56:57.530
And he told me I had the finest
skin he'd ever touched.

459
00:56:58.575 --> 00:57:02.386
And he told me that he would like it
to test it on the inside...

460
00:57:03.024 --> 00:57:06.345
thighs, where the skin is thinnest.

461
00:57:06.570 --> 00:57:09.768
After checking, he told me that
it really is the finest.

462
00:57:10.339 --> 00:57:15.105
Compared to women of the past.
So I was convinced that my "there" was special.

463
00:57:15.473 --> 00:57:18.740
It's more subtle than any woman.

464
00:57:24.304 --> 00:57:27.726
Would you be happy if I
to do it to you in my language

465
00:57:31.901 --> 00:57:33.418
Would you like that?

466
00:57:54.877 --> 00:57:56.000
Do you have a problem with that?

467
00:57:57.785 --> 00:57:58.866
Did you sleep with him?

468
00:57:59.812 --> 00:58:01.318
No, we were at the wall.

469
00:58:02.281 --> 00:58:06.529
- Did you go wild with him?
- No, he just licked my clit.

470
00:58:07.375 --> 00:58:11.233
I felt the heat and did
I just did what I had to do.

471
00:58:14.476 --> 00:58:21.565
You can lick me too, so
I don't understand your complicated feelings.

472
00:58:24.657 --> 00:58:26.285
Why are you crying?

473
00:58:34.569 --> 00:58:38.459
You're a strange man, Duncan Wedderburn.

474
00:58:38.895 --> 00:58:39.807
Liver.

475
00:58:49.403 --> 00:58:55.922
It's a small cut, and that's all
you need to do that.

476
00:59:09.588 --> 00:59:13.191
It was a blood clot caused by alcohol.
I must have had too much of it in me.

477
00:59:14.328 --> 00:59:18.851
I would venture a guess.
Are you upset about Bella's absence?

478
00:59:19.218 --> 00:59:22.533
Lately, I've been hearing sobs at night.

479
00:59:22.682 --> 00:59:26.693
You talk like an imbecile!
Bella's gone!

480
00:59:28.608 --> 00:59:33.823
I'm a scientist. I just need to
to get involved in the project and keep it going.

481
00:59:33.912 --> 00:59:36.651
That's all.
We have to move on to the next thing.

482
00:59:36.733 --> 00:59:39.430
We have to let go of our feelings.

483
00:59:40.072 --> 00:59:44.010
Do you think my dad just tagged my
genitals with a hot iron

484
00:59:44.126 --> 00:59:49.097
if he hadn't prioritized science and progress?

485
00:59:49.246 --> 00:59:50.223
Are they marked?

486
00:59:52.313 --> 00:59:54.072
Let's go find another body.

487
00:59:55.922 --> 00:59:56.925
And then what?

488
01:00:20.064 --> 01:00:21.204
Hello.

489
01:00:23.636 --> 01:00:25.061
Good morning, dear.

490
01:00:29.436 --> 01:00:32.600
I forgot to support
your adventurous spirit.

491
01:00:32.839 --> 01:00:34.461
So I've prepared a surprise for you.

492
01:00:42.897 --> 01:00:43.821
Get in there.

493
01:00:58.250 --> 01:00:59.800
Did we change hotels?

494
01:01:00.063 --> 01:01:01.855
Look out the window, Bella.

495
01:01:12.569 --> 01:01:14.362
- Are we on a boat?
- We'll be together forever.

496
01:01:15.506 --> 01:01:17.461
Do you want to live with Bella at sea?

497
01:01:17.462 --> 01:01:19.988
Let's treat ourselves to a new adventure.

498
01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:23.492
But it will be easier to find you.
So come on.

499
01:01:23.574 --> 01:01:26.024
Just jump on me, ride me.

500
01:01:27.332 --> 01:01:29.567
And then we'll have cocktails on the patio.

501
01:01:48.501 --> 01:01:49.601
Bella!

502
01:01:54.003 --> 01:01:54.889
Bella.

503
01:01:59.178 --> 01:02:00.155
Bella.

504
01:02:01.022 --> 01:02:02.080
Bella!

505
01:02:03.087 --> 01:02:05.437
Blue, blue, blue.

506
01:03:43.683 --> 01:03:44.817
Excuse me?

507
01:03:50.723 --> 01:03:51.700
Ma'am?

508
01:03:53.341 --> 01:03:54.777
Where do we sail?

509
01:03:56.404 --> 01:03:58.376
We'll be there in Athens in three days.

510
01:04:20.049 --> 01:04:25.058
BOAT

511
01:04:25.661 --> 01:04:27.553
Look Bella, my standards are high...

512
01:04:30.918 --> 01:04:35.195
I know you were upset, it's
I'm sorry I kidnapped you, it was out of pure love.

513
01:04:35.416 --> 01:04:37.774
It was just such a romantic joke.
Please forgive me.

514
01:04:38.293 --> 01:04:39.592
I want a drink.

515
01:04:39.674 --> 01:04:44.115
Of course, sweetheart. This boat is fun
and this is a trip around the world.

516
01:04:45.333 --> 01:04:46.936
Do you love me? I love you.

517
01:04:48.303 --> 01:04:52.214
I'll cut to the chase. Describe to me the elements that I would
I should look for in myself to keep me safe.

518
01:04:53.262 --> 01:04:54.546
That's too much love for me.

519
01:04:54.895 --> 01:04:57.726
There is no evidence,
that God created the universe.

520
01:04:59.048 --> 01:05:00.547
How to assess this empirically?

521
01:05:00.588 --> 01:05:02.550
What the hell are you talking about? Who are you?

522
01:05:02.907 --> 01:05:05.075
You don't know what bananas are,
you've never heard of chess

523
01:05:05.116 --> 01:05:07.182
so how is it possible that
you know the word "empirically".

524
01:05:07.442 --> 01:05:10.024
- Bella wants a drink.
- You've told me twice.

525
01:05:10.132 --> 01:05:14.186
I've never felt like this before.
Can you repeat that word back to me?

526
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.016
I guess it's empirical.

527
01:05:21.175 --> 01:05:22.450
I missed the ink.

528
01:05:23.236 --> 01:05:24.156
Yes, I can see that.

529
01:05:27.858 --> 01:05:29.528
I'll bring you more ink, love.

530
01:05:42.242 --> 01:05:46.560
Wow, what an interesting old lady sitting here.
May I touch your hair?

531
01:05:48.762 --> 01:05:54.751
I noticed your hair too, it's like
silk on a transparent, shiny egg.

532
01:05:55.037 --> 01:05:57.644
Those beautiful words in me
evoke great emotions.

533
01:05:57.849 --> 01:06:02.941
I saw you here yesterday with a man.
He's got nice white teeth, and apparently he's got a strong penis.

534
01:06:03.635 --> 01:06:08.606
Duncan Wedderburn likes to brush his teeth.
And his penis is clean, too.

535
01:06:08.607 --> 01:06:11.132
- Is he good in bed?
- He's like fire.

536
01:06:11.133 --> 01:06:14.041
I feel blissful pleasure with my whole body

537
01:06:14.082 --> 01:06:16.942
in my body and so
I reach my peak.

538
01:06:17.367 --> 01:06:21.563
I would like to throw his body or
maybe his corpse into the sea.

539
01:06:22.130 --> 01:06:23.659
This man is jumping all over your body?

540
01:06:24.072 --> 01:06:27.531
No, I haven't slept with anyone in 20 years.

541
01:06:27.727 --> 01:06:32.739
- What? That's terrible.
- I don't want to do it anymore, I'm not interested.

542
01:06:33.070 --> 01:06:35.486
After all these years, I'm more interested now

543
01:06:35.527 --> 01:06:37.877
about what's between my ears.

544
01:06:37.878 --> 01:06:42.523
And what I have between my legs... not so much.

545
01:06:42.605 --> 01:06:44.927
What a desperate rationalization, Martha.

546
01:06:44.928 --> 01:06:51.628
Oh, this is Harry Astley.
Don't take his words too seriously, he's a cynic.

547
01:06:52.113 --> 01:06:52.878
Ma'am.

548
01:06:53.737 --> 01:06:58.584
I'm Bella Baxter.
I don't know what a "cynic" is.

549
01:06:58.701 --> 01:07:00.860
Bella. Ink.

550
01:07:00.983 --> 01:07:05.342
Duncan Wedderburn.
I have made friends, colleagues and comrades here.

551
01:07:05.424 --> 01:07:06.563
Harry Asley.

552
01:07:06.973 --> 01:07:10.049
This is Martha. She's
she's my new friend who

553
01:07:10.090 --> 01:07:12.840
hasn't had it up her ass in 20 years.
Isn't that amazing?

554
01:07:13.533 --> 01:07:16.915
I hope you at least use your hand
between your legs to keep you happy.

555
01:07:16.957 --> 01:07:20.459
Bella, you can't talk like that.

556
01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:25.487
- Decent company.
- Decent company that will destroy you.

557
01:07:25.798 --> 01:07:28.121
- Is that true?
- Yes, there is a grain of truth in it.

558
01:07:28.122 --> 01:07:34.078
We can all agree on that.
As for the question of the hand, yes, sometimes.

559
01:07:34.641 --> 01:07:38.599
This is very encouraging news.
We are all going to have dinner together.

560
01:07:38.797 --> 01:07:39.896
Yes, in fact...

561
01:07:40.101 --> 01:07:43.219
we're all in this hole from which
we can't escape

562
01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:46.254
but here's a world that we can
to enjoy by traveling all over the planet.

563
01:07:46.554 --> 01:07:49.039
Life without friends is not
life, is it, Mr. Wedderburn?

564
01:07:49.395 --> 01:07:50.657
I was pleased.

565
01:07:54.279 --> 01:07:55.378
Marry me.

566
01:07:55.559 --> 01:07:56.373
What?

567
01:07:56.537 --> 01:08:00.176
I wanted to leave you after a few months
and send you home, but I don't want to do that now.

568
01:08:00.881 --> 01:08:03.376
Say you'll marry me.
No one has ever won my heart more than you.

569
01:08:04.687 --> 01:08:08.470
It's hard for me because I'm
engaged to Mr. Max McCandless.

570
01:08:09.821 --> 01:08:10.451
What?

571
01:08:11.133 --> 01:08:16.999
My hand belongs to someone else. I've already heard
that expression, but I didn't understand it.

572
01:08:17.366 --> 01:08:20.368
It doesn't just take that one hand, does it?

573
01:08:20.580 --> 01:08:22.861
You ran away from him with me.

574
01:08:23.269 --> 01:08:26.151
It is a description of events whose
I don't understand.

575
01:08:26.388 --> 01:08:30.296
- You chose me, not him.
- Just for fun, not forever.

576
01:08:30.850 --> 01:08:32.837
Damn, I'll throw you overboard...

577
01:08:33.700 --> 01:08:38.299
So are you going to marry me or are you going to kill me?
That's your suggestion?

578
01:08:38.381 --> 01:08:39.146
No.

579
01:08:55.183 --> 01:08:56.485
Oh, my God!

580
01:09:07.821 --> 01:09:10.795
Never mind, it goes on.

581
01:09:11.053 --> 01:09:14.434
I'll test your gross motor skills, your abilities

582
01:09:14.516 --> 01:09:19.272
should slowly improve.
Progress is rapid

583
01:09:21.187 --> 01:09:22.028
Felicity!
(New Experimental Human)

584
01:09:26.281 --> 01:09:27.304
Not so fast.

585
01:09:38.796 --> 01:09:43.068
I'm reading Emerson.
He writes here about the reformation of man.

586
01:09:43.313 --> 01:09:48.039
I don't know why he doesn't give advice to women.
Maybe he doesn't know any.

587
01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:51.503
Try reading Goethe.

588
01:09:51.830 --> 01:09:54.396
Philosophy is a waste of time, Bella.

589
01:09:54.593 --> 01:09:56.637
Tell me more about it...

590
01:09:56.883 --> 01:10:00.123
No, no Harry, you're a cynic...
And that's it.

591
01:10:00.881 --> 01:10:03.972
People and society can improve.

592
01:10:04.828 --> 01:10:08.985
Everyone's goal is to improve,
to progress and grow.

593
01:10:09.571 --> 01:10:12.203
I know this about myself and I am confident,
that I'm an example to all.

594
01:10:12.298 --> 01:10:16.167
Believe me Bella, you are definitely unique and that
in every way.

595
01:10:16.361 --> 01:10:19.511
But this refinement through
philosophy is but a vain attempt...

596
01:10:20.306 --> 01:10:23.729
man to escape from reality,
that we are all cruel beasts.

597
01:10:24.306 --> 01:10:26.465
So we were born
and that is how we will die.

598
01:10:27.541 --> 01:10:29.496
That's too dark a view of things, Harry.

599
01:10:29.672 --> 01:10:36.028
Bella, come out of this for a moment
to our cabin.

600
01:10:37.116 --> 01:10:39.899
The two are arguing and
these thoughts fly through

601
01:10:39.982 --> 01:10:42.576
Bella's head and heart
like a fire in a storm.

602
01:10:42.657 --> 01:10:43.404
Oh...

603
01:10:45.429 --> 01:10:47.584
You've changed, Bella.

604
01:10:48.159 --> 01:10:51.744
You lost a part for your
charming way of speaking.

605
01:10:51.826 --> 01:10:54.964
I'm constantly changing, like everyone.

606
01:10:55.046 --> 01:10:57.987
According to Emerson, apparently. Harry disagrees.

607
01:10:58.028 --> 01:10:59.242
Come on, let's go.

608
01:11:00.949 --> 01:11:02.375
You're blocking my sun.

609
01:11:02.828 --> 01:11:03.542
What?

610
01:11:41.947 --> 01:11:42.697
Let's go.

611
01:11:44.188 --> 01:11:46.958
I'm busy drinking heavily.

612
01:11:50.015 --> 01:11:51.781
And busy with a heavy loss.

613
01:12:30.579 --> 01:12:32.575
I wanted to go see Marta.

614
01:12:33.905 --> 01:12:35.004
To Martha.

615
01:12:36.117 --> 01:12:41.494
She's troubled. I don't like the
old lady, I should throw her overboard.

616
01:12:42.841 --> 01:12:44.591
Do you dare to do it?

617
01:12:54.087 --> 01:12:55.471
Martha!

618
01:12:56.613 --> 01:12:57.590
Where is he?

619
01:12:59.628 --> 01:13:00.727
Where is he?

620
01:13:02.115 --> 01:13:03.050
Where are you going?

621
01:13:03.051 --> 01:13:04.924
I'll throw her overboard!

622
01:13:04.925 --> 01:13:09.937
Wow how amazing, I never realized
to imagine someone killing me. How dramatic.

623
01:13:10.036 --> 01:13:12.871
She seems happy to die.
I'm sorry to disturb you.

624
01:13:37.363 --> 01:13:38.659
I'll do it again.

625
01:14:12.094 --> 01:14:17.268
You made me think, think,
to protect myself from the wrong ideas...

626
01:14:17.269 --> 01:14:23.707
I was confused and couldn't fall asleep.

627
01:14:23.708 --> 01:14:24.685
A?

628
01:14:26.437 --> 01:14:32.589
You say they're all cruel, but I
I'm not disagreeing, I'm just telling you it's not true.

629
01:14:33.487 --> 01:14:38.131
But when I
with Duncan, the cruelty rises in me.

630
01:14:38.621 --> 01:14:42.654
That's good judgment.
And that Duncan is an asshole.

631
01:14:42.696 --> 01:14:49.539
No. I don't want to be cruel.
In that sense, I want to be better.

632
01:14:50.158 --> 01:14:53.187
You don't know the world but you are afraid of it.

633
01:14:55.506 --> 01:14:57.135
I'm not afraid.

634
01:14:57.462 --> 01:15:01.577
Do you want to see what this world is really like?
I'll show it to you.

635
01:15:01.862 --> 01:15:04.003
Yes, naturally.

636
01:15:38.007 --> 01:15:42.064
ALEXANDRIA

637
01:15:50.095 --> 01:15:51.161
You hear that?

638
01:15:54.503 --> 01:15:55.581
What is it?

639
01:16:16.804 --> 01:16:18.555
Lots of dead children.

640
01:16:19.244 --> 01:16:20.257
It's from the heat.

641
01:16:21.974 --> 01:16:23.521
We have to help them.

642
01:16:24.514 --> 01:16:25.801
How are you going to do it?

643
01:16:28.590 --> 01:16:32.660
If we go down there, they'll beat us up,
robbed and raped.

644
01:16:33.765 --> 01:16:38.042
And if they were here and we were there,
we'd do the same to them.

645
01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:43.259
Bella?

646
01:16:44.196 --> 01:16:45.092
Bella.

647
01:16:45.949 --> 01:16:46.967
Bella!

648
01:18:27.245 --> 01:18:28.671
We're just sailing away, ma'am.

649
01:18:29.488 --> 01:18:30.814
But I have to go back there.

650
01:18:31.706 --> 01:18:34.361
I have to give this money
to the poor people who live next door

651
01:18:34.402 --> 01:18:37.043
hotel, in the so-called slums.

652
01:18:38.228 --> 01:18:41.976
I'll stay here on the ground, ma'am.
I can give them to them for you.

653
01:18:42.668 --> 01:18:43.808
Would you really like to do that?

654
01:18:43.890 --> 01:18:46.660
Yeah, sure. That's very generous of you.

655
01:18:47.027 --> 01:18:48.494
They need money.

656
01:18:48.706 --> 01:18:49.805
Everyone needs them.

657
01:18:55.421 --> 01:18:56.521
Thank you.

658
01:19:13.147 --> 01:19:16.818
You! Bring me the captain. Find me
the damned thief.

659
01:19:16.902 --> 01:19:17.505
Bella!

660
01:19:19.634 --> 01:19:20.543
We've been robbed!

661
01:19:21.509 --> 01:19:28.028
Nothing like this has ever happened to me before.
And now it's all gone.

662
01:19:28.321 --> 01:19:30.919
Nobody robbed you, I took them.

663
01:19:31.132 --> 01:19:31.734
What?

664
01:19:32.527 --> 01:19:33.348
It was me.

665
01:19:35.288 --> 01:19:36.680
I'm so tired.

666
01:19:38.671 --> 01:19:44.535
I think my spirit broke in a moment,
when I lost my soul.

667
01:19:44.790 --> 01:19:49.615
Wrinkled, overwhelmed and depressed by it,
by what I saw today.

668
01:19:52.729 --> 01:19:54.818
So the captain is no longer needed, sir?

669
01:19:54.859 --> 01:19:56.331
Get out or I'll knock your teeth out!

670
01:19:57.374 --> 01:19:58.473
Yes, sir.

671
01:20:02.338 --> 01:20:05.113
Where did you put it?
Did you hide them somewhere safe?

672
01:20:05.687 --> 01:20:09.028
And I irresponsibly left them in plain sight.
Tell me, where are they?

673
01:20:09.558 --> 01:20:15.425
I didn't hide anything,
I gave them to those poor people.

674
01:20:15.914 --> 01:20:21.456
Money itself is a disease,
it's all about the lack of it.

675
01:20:22.435 --> 01:20:26.536
I'm lying here on the mattress...

676
01:20:27.557 --> 01:20:31.112
like those dead kids...in the ditch.

677
01:20:33.192 --> 01:20:34.251
Duncan...

678
01:20:36.046 --> 01:20:37.486
What should I do?

679
01:20:39.263 --> 01:20:42.318
I'm waiting for a reassuring hug.

680
01:20:44.370 --> 01:20:51.622
I had to offer something to the world.
But I have nothing... except money.

681
01:20:53.307 --> 01:20:55.913
Today is a bad day for Bella Baxter.

682
01:20:57.330 --> 01:21:00.304
Where the fuck is my money?

683
01:21:00.842 --> 01:21:04.834
I told you once before that I've
to those poor, poor people.

684
01:21:06.458 --> 01:21:08.372
I told you to leave!

685
01:21:09.787 --> 01:21:12.034
The officer informed me that you might not have

686
01:21:12.075 --> 01:21:14.112
sufficient funds
to pay the bill, sir.

687
01:21:14.607 --> 01:21:19.058
I guess that's true.
I gave everything to some kind man.

688
01:21:20.082 --> 01:21:23.189
So he could give it to those poor people.

689
01:21:23.898 --> 01:21:28.163
In the next port you will be disembarked and there
you'll have to make do with rations, sir.

690
01:21:28.893 --> 01:21:29.658
I bow.

691
01:21:29.740 --> 01:21:30.635
How dare you!

692
01:21:41.053 --> 01:21:44.597
"Dead and blind children."

693
01:21:46.121 --> 01:21:54.188
"Harry showed it to me.
The trenches were full of blood."

694
01:21:55.694 --> 01:21:56.875
Poor Bella.

695
01:21:58.508 --> 01:21:59.852
It is overloaded.

696
01:22:04.939 --> 01:22:07.709
- What about your hand?
- It's fine. Sorry.

697
01:22:08.254 --> 01:22:09.947
- You tried to help me understand.
- No.

698
01:22:10.162 --> 01:22:12.810
Actually, I wanted to hurt you.

699
01:22:13.861 --> 01:22:17.853
I couldn't stand to look at someone
so stupid and beautifully happy.

700
01:22:18.189 --> 01:22:19.343
It was cruel of me.

701
01:22:20.219 --> 01:22:25.420
- If I know the world, I can do better.
- That's not important.

702
01:22:25.512 --> 01:22:26.896
It's just a feeling.

703
01:22:27.725 --> 01:22:31.962
Don't accept the lies of religion,
of socialism and capitalism.

704
01:22:32.351 --> 01:22:35.120
We're an unpleasant species. Learn this.

705
01:22:35.304 --> 01:22:37.499
We are just animals and our hopes are dashed.

706
01:22:38.149 --> 01:22:39.901
Protect yourselves with the truth.

707
01:22:41.620 --> 01:22:43.493
Now I understand who you are, Harry.

708
01:22:43.914 --> 01:22:47.378
You're just a broken child,
who can't bear the pain of this world.

709
01:22:48.751 --> 01:22:50.136
I suppose that's the way it's gonna be.

710
01:22:58.816 --> 01:23:01.830
Goodbye, Harry. We'll get fired in Marseille.

711
01:23:02.483 --> 01:23:04.357
Why are you staying with him?

712
01:23:04.515 --> 01:23:06.247
I still think it will get better one day.

713
01:23:08.168 --> 01:23:09.269
I'm sure you can handle it.

714
01:23:19.386 --> 01:23:22.709
PARIS

715
01:23:25.268 --> 01:23:27.949
I've heard a lot about the beauty of Paris.

716
01:23:31.317 --> 01:23:33.639
Let's kill the fucking dog!

717
01:23:38.723 --> 01:23:42.431
In Paris without money...
What do you suggest we do, Bella?

718
01:23:42.432 --> 01:23:44.753
We'll find a hotel, don't worry.

719
01:23:44.754 --> 01:23:46.997
Which hotel? We have no money.

720
01:23:48.747 --> 01:23:50.864
But this will be for me
an interesting experiment.

721
01:23:51.641 --> 01:23:53.840
Tell me, how are we to live now?

722
01:23:53.841 --> 01:23:56.774
- I don't know!
- Exactly, that's the experiment.

723
01:23:57.183 --> 01:23:58.486
We are not poor.

724
01:23:59.424 --> 01:24:01.896
Many adventurers have faced
such difficulties.

725
01:24:02.422 --> 01:24:04.394
Robinson Crusoe, for example.

726
01:24:04.395 --> 01:24:06.753
A selfish, reckless, careless fool.

727
01:24:06.930 --> 01:24:11.259
I'm not ruthless, Duncan.
Just my way of thinking

728
01:24:11.341 --> 01:24:14.421
about things not
very developed.

729
01:24:15.373 --> 01:24:16.199
Nevertheless...

730
01:24:16.658 --> 01:24:18.597
I helped those who suffered.

731
01:24:18.942 --> 01:24:21.509
I ruined us, just like you said.

732
01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:24.565
But my actions
come from the best of intentions.

733
01:24:24.647 --> 01:24:28.657
- Cut the fucking shit, shut up!
- I'm going to the hotel.

734
01:24:33.993 --> 01:24:35.546
Good evening, ma'am.

735
01:24:35.745 --> 01:24:38.878
Hello, what brought you here my dear
fresh English rose.

736
01:24:39.859 --> 01:24:40.877
Is it a hotel?

737
01:24:40.961 --> 01:24:43.530
We have rooms here.
Looking for some work?

738
01:24:43.813 --> 01:24:45.093
How much per room?

739
01:24:45.281 --> 01:24:50.441
I'll pay you 10 francs an hour.
I charge the others 30. Everybody's happy with us.

740
01:24:51.051 --> 01:24:52.016
I see.

741
01:24:52.528 --> 01:24:55.909
We have a new girl from London.

742
01:24:56.140 --> 01:24:57.729
How do you do? Hi.

743
01:25:03.723 --> 01:25:04.772
So what? Are you coming?

744
01:25:05.335 --> 01:25:07.127
Somehow I'm confused.

745
01:25:07.244 --> 01:25:09.611
Didn't you come to work?
Come on!

746
01:25:09.893 --> 01:25:13.762
Sleep with him, have fun
and he'll pay you well.

747
01:25:14.415 --> 01:25:17.191
Seriously... Is he gonna pay me for this?

748
01:25:17.736 --> 01:25:22.594
Yes, if you need money,
this is the shortest route for you.

749
01:25:23.672 --> 01:25:28.402
I've never slept with a stranger
a man, I can't believe it.

750
01:25:29.574 --> 01:25:31.203
But I need the money...

751
01:25:32.345 --> 01:25:38.049
This coincidence
I consider almost fatal.

752
01:25:38.294 --> 01:25:39.301
Let's do it.

753
01:25:42.118 --> 01:25:43.543
Room No.16

754
01:26:06.626 --> 01:26:07.686
Can we get started?

755
01:26:20.309 --> 01:26:21.571
What's your name?

756
01:26:29.108 --> 01:26:30.818
The mysterious...

757
01:26:57.769 --> 01:26:59.753
Couldn't you warm me up before...?

758
01:27:23.371 --> 01:27:24.308
Thank you.

759
01:27:31.982 --> 01:27:34.621
Look! I got chocolate cake.

760
01:27:35.733 --> 01:27:38.666
I got money and some enlightenment.

761
01:27:39.684 --> 01:27:40.528
Did you steal them?

762
01:27:40.610 --> 01:27:43.441
You always told me
you're the best in bed but...

763
01:27:43.730 --> 01:27:47.013
I've met someone else, so I'm
wondering if it was even true.

764
01:27:47.905 --> 01:27:50.882
But now I know. He was so skinny.

765
01:27:51.198 --> 01:27:54.426
When he pressed up against me,
he started making these ungodly noises.

766
01:27:54.669 --> 01:27:58.036
And all he could manage was three pushes.

767
01:27:58.417 --> 01:28:01.178
I started laughing, politely of course.
I took his money...

768
01:28:01.802 --> 01:28:06.030
I thanked him and went
to buy these cakes.

769
01:28:06.366 --> 01:28:11.011
I just remembered our
passionate and sweaty nights.

770
01:28:12.584 --> 01:28:14.214
Fuck that kind of money!

771
01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:17.884
This is an experiment and is very
useful for our relationship...

772
01:28:17.925 --> 01:28:20.527
because my heart is
turns towards you.

773
01:28:20.828 --> 01:28:24.658
Lately, it's calmed down in me,
but you're always so argumentative and angry.

774
01:28:26.126 --> 01:28:27.348
You're a monster.

775
01:28:27.349 --> 01:28:32.086
You're the fucking demon
sent from hell to destroy my

776
01:28:32.127 --> 01:28:36.720
spirit and punished my deeds.
You destroyed my heart like a tsunami.

777
01:28:36.812 --> 01:28:39.403
She picked him up and crushed him.
I don't feel anything for you anymore.

778
01:28:39.444 --> 01:28:41.792
When I look at you already
I see nothing but ugliness.

779
01:28:43.255 --> 01:28:45.865
Your last sentence was
inappropriate and nonsensical...

780
01:28:46.536 --> 01:28:49.870
because your odes to my beauty
were dull but constant.

781
01:28:50.589 --> 01:28:53.961
And this simple act, when I
I let myself be ridden

782
01:28:54.002 --> 01:28:56.841
of a stranger to destroy our past?

783
01:28:59.107 --> 01:29:02.439
Shit! Control yourself!

784
01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:06.699
I've revealed my transgressions to you,
so let's part ways.

785
01:29:06.700 --> 01:29:09.348
This is the worst thing a woman can do!

786
01:29:10.531 --> 01:29:12.445
We certainly shouldn't be married.

787
01:29:13.383 --> 01:29:16.295
I'm imperfect
and experimental person and I need

788
01:29:16.336 --> 01:29:18.521
a husband with a more forgiving nature.

789
01:29:19.246 --> 01:29:20.386
Fuck! Fuck!

790
01:29:20.762 --> 01:29:24.580
I see now that you were just pretending.
Our adventure is over.

791
01:29:25.174 --> 01:29:30.765
- I'll book you a ticket to London.
- You've had money on you all this time?

792
01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:34.016
This is God's money. For emergencies.

793
01:29:34.017 --> 01:29:36.623
It's crazy, but now
you're a witch!

794
01:29:36.624 --> 01:29:40.698
All this time, I trusted you,
that you could do it.

795
01:29:41.026 --> 01:29:44.488
But now I see that I was wrong and
it's obvious that something's broken inside you.

796
01:29:44.489 --> 01:29:46.566
You're the one who broke something in me!

797
01:29:46.990 --> 01:29:49.056
It seems to me that this
conversation has become distorted.

798
01:29:49.179 --> 01:29:51.344
Oh, shit!

799
01:29:57.502 --> 01:30:01.862
Mrs. Swiney, I've reconsidered my
the situation. I need sex and money.

800
01:30:02.188 --> 01:30:07.444
I need a lover who
who doesn't require too much attention.

801
01:30:07.689 --> 01:30:12.714
20 minutes will be enough and the rest of the time I will
studying the world and how to make it better.

802
01:30:13.353 --> 01:30:18.854
That's why I'm looking
for a job and I'm asking for a suitable schedule.

803
01:30:18.854 --> 01:30:21.992
You are a woman who has made
a step towards your freedom.

804
01:30:22.814 --> 01:30:25.625
How adorable you are! Come on.

805
01:30:29.327 --> 01:30:31.567
Oh, Mr. Savier.

806
01:30:33.212 --> 01:30:34.394
Filet Mignon.

807
01:30:34.912 --> 01:30:38.294
What a nice piece!
Thank you.

808
01:30:39.638 --> 01:30:40.779
What would you like?

809
01:30:49.628 --> 01:30:50.686
Bella.

810
01:30:52.827 --> 01:30:55.435
Say "impressive" at the end.
House rules.

811
01:31:24.356 --> 01:31:25.850
Is that your scent?

812
01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:03.008
- Stunning.
- Thank you.

813
01:32:11.904 --> 01:32:14.837
Lavender handkerchief.
It's because of the smell.

814
01:32:16.176 --> 01:32:19.924
And tea for you because you're English.

815
01:32:20.452 --> 01:32:21.260
Mercy.

816
01:32:22.392 --> 01:32:23.429
It was brutal.

817
01:32:24.056 --> 01:32:26.214
So strange, but it wasn't
uncomfortable for me.

818
01:32:29.394 --> 01:32:32.205
Brochures - I am a socialist.
Read them.

819
01:32:32.206 --> 01:32:33.072
What is it?

820
01:32:33.113 --> 01:32:35.831
It's about a man who wants
to change the world for the better.

821
01:32:35.832 --> 01:32:37.868
Make it better. A better world.

822
01:32:38.725 --> 01:32:40.314
Can I do that too?

823
01:32:51.525 --> 01:32:54.254
Madam Swiney, I don't like this system
of choosing how men freely choose women.

824
01:32:54.678 --> 01:32:58.155
You expect me to go upstairs with a man,
even though I know it'll make me uncomfortable.

825
01:32:58.353 --> 01:33:02.006
Those wild jumps are sometimes
very uncomfortable for me.

826
01:33:02.130 --> 01:33:04.044
That's normal, dear.

827
01:33:07.735 --> 01:33:11.361
You're pretty, that's why I'm putting you first.

828
01:33:12.495 --> 01:33:13.675
Well that makes sense.

829
01:33:13.806 --> 01:33:17.024
And here is our new girl. Bella.

830
01:33:18.217 --> 01:33:20.376
Wouldn't you rather,
if women chose you?

831
01:33:20.816 --> 01:33:23.133
After all, it would be
a sign of enthusiasm for you.

832
01:33:24.067 --> 01:33:27.470
You won't get a creepy feeling about it,
that you'll be terrified when they jump you?

833
01:33:27.626 --> 01:33:29.812
Horror?
What the hell?

834
01:33:29.813 --> 01:33:32.050
It won't be any horror, Mr. Meursault.

835
01:33:32.091 --> 01:33:34.536
Bella's new here and a little bit
she lacks intelligence.

836
01:33:35.478 --> 01:33:37.435
And he still doesn't understand how it's done.

837
01:33:38.833 --> 01:33:40.745
As God, my father, said
"I will be your guide."

838
01:33:40.848 --> 01:33:43.323
"Until you find a way."

839
01:33:43.559 --> 01:33:46.370
And it will be until we discover a new way.

840
01:33:46.371 --> 01:33:49.218
And so it will continue,
until the world is no longer flat

841
01:33:49.306 --> 01:33:51.642
lights up at night and boots
will no longer be tied with laces.

842
01:33:52.094 --> 01:33:54.624
As a socialist, I fully agree with her.

843
01:33:55.130 --> 01:33:55.740
Absolutely.

844
01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:58.305
Since you have such a smart mouth...

845
01:33:58.692 --> 01:34:01.910
Monsieur Meursault
will have a free ride with you.

846
01:34:02.083 --> 01:34:03.590
Right now.

847
01:34:03.989 --> 01:34:06.597
Bella, come to my office.

848
01:34:08.669 --> 01:34:11.308
You also have tasty lobes.

849
01:34:12.610 --> 01:34:13.349
Thank you.

850
01:34:13.433 --> 01:34:14.059
Come on.

851
01:34:18.469 --> 01:34:20.498
Oh, I'm sorry you're bleeding.

852
01:34:21.058 --> 01:34:21.905
Be my guest.

853
01:34:24.712 --> 01:34:27.867
Sometimes I can't not see
the beauty, the beauty of youth.

854
01:34:28.246 --> 01:34:33.063
Because one day, my dear, you will become
an old and wrinkled woman.

855
01:34:33.747 --> 01:34:37.899
And nobody's gonna pay you anything, not even
they won't want you for free.

856
01:34:38.563 --> 01:34:41.492
I still think we could all be
happier. It's up to us how we decide.

857
01:34:41.586 --> 01:34:44.274
You're an idealist... just like me.

858
01:34:45.053 --> 01:34:46.967
We are just responding to the needs of the world.

859
01:34:47.538 --> 01:34:50.615
But sometimes we have to step back
to the demands of this world,

860
01:34:50.656 --> 01:34:53.772
sometimes we have to fight it,
try to defeat it.

861
01:34:53.772 --> 01:34:55.564
- So you agree with me?
- Of course!

862
01:34:55.687 --> 01:34:59.943
Some men, however, like it,
when you don't like it.

863
01:35:00.351 --> 01:35:01.246
What?

864
01:35:03.162 --> 01:35:05.827
I think it's probably good for business.

865
01:35:06.553 --> 01:35:07.490
Probably.

866
01:35:12.858 --> 01:35:18.357
My granddaughter... is sick and weak and needs medical attention.

867
01:35:18.481 --> 01:35:21.584
Whatever you do, everything will go down the drain.

868
01:35:23.233 --> 01:35:26.438
And your health is linked to it
and your life. Is that what you want, Bella?

869
01:35:26.849 --> 01:35:30.068
- Of course not.
- Oh no, you're so nice!

870
01:35:31.535 --> 01:35:34.457
I thought you were coming
to bite my lobes again.

871
01:35:34.836 --> 01:35:36.343
We have to work.

872
01:35:37.037 --> 01:35:39.114
We have to make money.

873
01:35:39.522 --> 01:35:42.903
But more than that, we have to experience it all.

874
01:35:42.904 --> 01:35:47.209
but also humiliation, horror, sorrow.

875
01:35:47.454 --> 01:35:49.450
That makes us perfect, Bella.

876
01:35:50.031 --> 01:35:51.306
Serious people.

877
01:35:52.317 --> 01:35:54.720
And not eccentric, unspoiled girls.

878
01:35:56.155 --> 01:35:57.907
This is how we can get to know the world.

879
01:35:59.055 --> 01:36:02.626
And when we know the world, the world will be ours.

880
01:36:03.986 --> 01:36:05.329
I want it.

881
01:36:06.023 --> 01:36:07.000
Well...

882
01:36:07.496 --> 01:36:11.174
So go with someone to
and bring me 10 francs.

883
01:36:16.114 --> 01:36:18.516
To begin with, I propose a short survey.

884
01:36:19.189 --> 01:36:20.329
Survey?

885
01:36:20.870 --> 01:36:24.781
Tell me one experience from your childhood,
that you remember best.

886
01:36:25.435 --> 01:36:26.953
And I'll tell you a joke for that.

887
01:36:27.145 --> 01:36:28.204
Knock, knock. "Who's there?"

888
01:36:28.409 --> 01:36:29.997
When I feel him there...

889
01:36:30.079 --> 01:36:33.297
I quickly dip it in lavender oil.

890
01:36:33.298 --> 01:36:37.902
It should enhance the experience and make it
"impressive".

891
01:36:38.437 --> 01:36:39.251
Knock, knock. "Who's there?"

892
01:36:39.711 --> 01:36:40.525
Knock, knock. "Who's there?"

893
01:36:41.178 --> 01:36:44.233
No, it was a joke, you don't remember.

894
01:36:45.127 --> 01:36:46.104
Now you, you go.

895
01:36:54.484 --> 01:36:58.111
When you were a kid, you fell off your bike in Greece.

896
01:36:58.195 --> 01:36:59.001
Yes, it is.

897
01:37:04.897 --> 01:37:05.752
Blood.

898
01:37:10.736 --> 01:37:11.590
Happy?

899
01:37:12.071 --> 01:37:14.309
- You enjoyed the sight of the blood.
- Yes, you did.

900
01:37:14.973 --> 01:37:16.888
- Knock, knock.
- "Who's there?"

901
01:37:17.311 --> 01:37:18.059
Cheese.

902
01:37:18.248 --> 01:37:19.266
What cheese?

903
01:37:19.701 --> 01:37:21.046
Cheese for the meeting.

904
01:37:31.359 --> 01:37:32.416
Did you know him?

905
01:37:36.748 --> 01:37:37.684
You smell good,

906
01:37:37.995 --> 01:37:39.013
Get your ass over here.

907
01:38:24.203 --> 01:38:26.565
God has blessed you, my friend.

908
01:38:29.717 --> 01:38:30.863
It's more of a curse.

909
01:39:07.062 --> 01:39:08.609
Very rough cut.

910
01:39:09.155 --> 01:39:11.313
Is this what you eat when you miss home?

911
01:39:25.810 --> 01:39:26.781
What would you like?

912
01:39:26.955 --> 01:39:30.132
My kids came here for sex education.

913
01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:32.340
I want to demonstrate it to them.

914
01:39:32.886 --> 01:39:33.985
I can see that.

915
01:39:34.581 --> 01:39:40.815
If you are playing with women's breasts,
your penis gets aroused.

916
01:39:41.975 --> 01:39:43.053
In some cases...

917
01:39:43.692 --> 01:39:47.684
if the penis is not aroused,
you can ask for help.

918
01:39:51.796 --> 01:39:53.629
This promotes blood flow.

919
01:39:56.156 --> 01:39:59.633
- After reaching the hardness...
- Lying, standing, sideways?

920
01:39:59.820 --> 01:40:01.734
Let's start with something simple.

921
01:40:06.873 --> 01:40:08.462
Let's start gradually.

922
01:40:11.206 --> 01:40:13.968
I usually stick to four-quarter time.

923
01:40:34.367 --> 01:40:35.913
Do you also use your mouth?

924
01:40:35.996 --> 01:40:41.345
Sometimes a finger can help
in your ass or something.

925
01:40:47.283 --> 01:40:49.351
Brilliant. Brilliant.

926
01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:10.840
Come home!

927
01:41:17.193 --> 01:41:19.143
Bellaaa!

928
01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:24.964
Swiney was right.
I'm discovering things in myself that I've never known before.

929
01:41:25.250 --> 01:41:27.205
Did you see the way he looks at my tits?

930
01:41:27.450 --> 01:41:30.874
I think the speech
of desires is very interesting.

931
01:41:30.915 --> 01:41:34.376
Have they ever asked you,
to put a pineapple in your mouth?

932
01:41:34.377 --> 01:41:36.862
- Yes, it happened to me once.
- Bella!

933
01:41:38.312 --> 01:41:43.812
Bella, I'm ready to forgive you.
I separated the cabin from the double bed.

934
01:41:44.912 --> 01:41:48.415
You slept with that guy
with that tail on your head?

935
01:41:49.022 --> 01:41:51.588
I made mush out of it!

936
01:41:51.972 --> 01:41:53.667
Duncan, I thought you were gone.

937
01:41:54.001 --> 01:41:57.591
On the boat I got sick and threw up and
I came back to save you.

938
01:41:57.919 --> 01:42:01.266
- Stop begging, you don't look good.
- No.

939
01:42:02.116 --> 01:42:04.736
Go home, Duncan. Our time is up.
I look at you and

940
01:42:05.342 --> 01:42:08.372
I don't feel anything for you, I'm just confused
about how I could possibly want you.

941
01:42:08.473 --> 01:42:11.080
Well it's time for us to go
to the socialist meeting.

942
01:42:13.898 --> 01:42:15.038
You are common whores!

943
01:42:15.492 --> 01:42:18.691
We have our own means of production.
Get out!

944
01:42:31.461 --> 01:42:35.202
Pitcher. Half-liter jug.

945
01:42:35.310 --> 01:42:36.448
Very good.

946
01:42:40.327 --> 01:42:42.567
The language is gradually improving,
but the speech is also getting better.

947
01:42:42.769 --> 01:42:43.910
Paint container.

948
01:42:43.992 --> 01:42:44.969
Well done.

949
01:42:45.868 --> 01:42:47.584
Can't you be so cruel to her?

950
01:42:47.865 --> 01:42:51.263
I made a mistake with Bella.
Now I'm letting the feelings develop.

951
01:42:51.980 --> 01:42:55.433
There is no love in it, no different from chickens.

952
01:42:56.015 --> 01:42:58.296
- Pitcher.
- Maybe it's better this way.

953
01:42:58.826 --> 01:43:04.284
That explains my father's cruelty towards me.
It was necessary for science.

954
01:43:04.763 --> 01:43:05.862
Good God, fine...

955
01:43:06.317 --> 01:43:09.860
I don't expect the town doctor to get it.

956
01:43:11.271 --> 01:43:13.988
By the way, I need,
for you to operate on me.

957
01:43:14.244 --> 01:43:16.888
Put a living heart in yours
monstrous body?

958
01:43:17.076 --> 01:43:23.513
If you have time, cut me... this.

959
01:43:40.929 --> 01:43:46.210
- Should I also remove the surrounding tissue?
- There's no need.- I'll be fine if you close it.

960
01:43:47.102 --> 01:43:49.669
It has been extended. It's just a small polyp.

961
01:43:52.792 --> 01:43:53.932
I'm dying.

962
01:43:54.478 --> 01:43:57.004
How to tell my apprentice, right?

963
01:43:57.467 --> 01:43:58.639
Baxter, I...

964
01:43:58.729 --> 01:44:01.741
Don't cry in my wound, do it faster
or you'll kill me with sepsis!

965
01:44:02.488 --> 01:44:04.233
Shut up and sew me up.

966
01:44:06.482 --> 01:44:07.663
Find it.

967
01:44:13.037 --> 01:44:14.707
Do not disturb.

968
01:44:21.728 --> 01:44:25.679
Hot chocolate, my dear, chocolate.

969
01:44:34.204 --> 01:44:35.451
You're my favorite.

970
01:44:37.593 --> 01:44:39.490
I've heard you've told others.

971
01:44:40.202 --> 01:44:43.745
We are machines powered by praise and chocolate.

972
01:44:43.746 --> 01:44:45.787
They're my girls,
I give them my love in return.

973
01:44:52.467 --> 01:44:57.559
Something terrible has happened
I... I feel almost nothing.

974
01:44:59.652 --> 01:45:04.986
My compassion is turning into something,
what I would call contemptuous anger.

975
01:45:05.112 --> 01:45:07.776
- That's amazing!
- Like what?

976
01:45:10.952 --> 01:45:15.496
You're in a dark phase.
Before the light comes to you and

977
01:45:15.580 --> 01:45:19.717
wisdom, you have to overcome it.

978
01:45:20.653 --> 01:45:23.466
And when you come to
the other side, you'll be for

979
01:45:23.507 --> 01:45:26.234
this time grateful, but she had no
you shouldn't stop.

980
01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:42.825
- Where's your kid?
- What kid?

981
01:46:43.408 --> 01:46:44.424
You got a scar there from the baby.

982
01:46:45.097 --> 01:46:46.191
I have it too, here.

983
01:46:47.613 --> 01:46:49.954
See here.

984
01:46:51.071 --> 01:46:52.317
I don't have it.

985
01:46:53.645 --> 01:46:55.331
That's the scar from one accident.

986
01:46:56.017 --> 01:46:57.971
But you're not the first to make a mistake.

987
01:46:58.469 --> 01:46:59.409
Why are you lying?

988
01:47:00.564 --> 01:47:01.563
I'm not lying.

989
01:47:02.418 --> 01:47:04.127
Godwin himself told me.

990
01:47:05.362 --> 01:47:07.562
- Father?
- Yes.

991
01:47:08.140 --> 01:47:08.750
Good.

992
01:47:21.750 --> 01:47:22.879
From Wedderburn.

993
01:47:47.608 --> 01:47:48.911
Hello sir.

994
01:47:53.414 --> 01:47:55.497
Have you written to Mr. Godwin Baxter?

995
01:47:55.697 --> 01:47:57.594
Sent to the world
a demon, a devil rat, a seductive flesh

996
01:47:57.702 --> 01:48:02.569
that you
never get tired and a mind that destroys people...

997
01:48:02.651 --> 01:48:07.864
Sing the song of the bloody
and burnt elephant...

998
01:48:08.355 --> 01:48:10.432
Bella. Where is she?

999
01:48:10.936 --> 01:48:11.707
Who are you?

1000
01:48:12.213 --> 01:48:13.638
I'm her fiancé, sir.

1001
01:48:17.985 --> 01:48:20.755
Apparently it's between you
didn't end well between the two of you.

1002
01:48:20.839 --> 01:48:23.924
Did it end that badly?...broke me.

1003
01:48:24.914 --> 01:48:27.887
We are all captains of our own ships, sir.
I understand.

1004
01:48:27.969 --> 01:48:30.356
I don't like your words.

1005
01:48:31.282 --> 01:48:35.709
That Godwin Baxter, you know, threw
on me and caught me.

1006
01:48:37.723 --> 01:48:38.691
Where is he?

1007
01:48:38.733 --> 01:48:41.756
"I wouldn't wish that on my
worst enemy."

1008
01:48:43.347 --> 01:48:45.994
I must protect you from her, sir.

1009
01:48:59.320 --> 01:49:02.488
Please forgive my irritation...
Tell me!

1010
01:49:02.529 --> 01:49:03.598
I won't hurt you.

1011
01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:07.754
I don't have the guts, Bella just pissed me off.

1012
01:49:07.755 --> 01:49:13.092
My soul, my bank account!
I've got nothing, shall I sing it to you?

1013
01:49:17.879 --> 01:49:20.039
- Stop it! Stop it!
- I'm in a death trap.

1014
01:49:22.495 --> 01:49:29.135
- Explain to the artist who did not understand the sentence.
- "Captains of their ships"...

1015
01:49:29.177 --> 01:49:32.477
You can't just make up stupid stuff like that!

1016
01:49:32.682 --> 01:49:37.041
Look, I'm asking you as politely as I can:
Where is it?

1017
01:49:46.332 --> 01:49:47.298
List.

1018
01:49:49.429 --> 01:49:50.447
Thank you.

1019
01:49:55.541 --> 01:49:57.742
MAY HE REST IN PEACE

1020
01:49:59.950 --> 01:50:03.987
LONDON

1021
01:50:33.115 --> 01:50:34.472
The bitch is back!

1022
01:50:39.873 --> 01:50:41.672
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Bella!

1023
01:50:42.325 --> 01:50:43.524
Max wrote to me.

1024
01:50:43.954 --> 01:50:44.972
Are you sick?

1025
01:50:44.973 --> 01:50:49.984
No, I'm dying.
The difference is slight, you don't have to worry.

1026
01:50:50.168 --> 01:50:53.000
- You're an experienced man.
- You can't die.

1027
01:50:53.082 --> 01:50:55.235
Empirical evidence suggests otherwise.

1028
01:50:56.723 --> 01:50:57.945
I missed you.

1029
01:50:59.080 --> 01:51:01.676
Now... I have to go to bed.

1030
01:51:07.841 --> 01:51:14.115
I got an offer
and I faced difficulties.

1031
01:51:15.549 --> 01:51:19.242
Did I get pregnant somewhere?
If so, where is my baby?

1032
01:51:19.466 --> 01:51:27.533
The way I see it, technically you're the one
the baby, but I think you're also the baby's mom.

1033
01:51:28.243 --> 01:51:34.069
You are neither one nor the other.
There are no memories or experiences left.

1034
01:51:34.909 --> 01:51:36.560
What do you mean, both mother and daughter?

1035
01:51:54.860 --> 01:51:56.612
You knew and you didn't tell me.

1036
01:51:56.735 --> 01:51:59.505
I had no reason to.

1037
01:51:59.714 --> 01:52:02.574
- Maybe you're very cowardly.
- That too, but only partially.

1038
01:52:04.029 --> 01:52:08.347
You know, I still wanted to be with you.
I wish the time would come when you'd understand.

1039
01:52:08.348 --> 01:52:13.074
And Baxter here made me
some kind of prisoner, and I...

1040
01:52:16.635 --> 01:52:17.530
I'm sorry.

1041
01:52:42.239 --> 01:52:43.305
Who is it?

1042
01:52:43.718 --> 01:52:45.340
Hello bitch.

1043
01:52:45.929 --> 01:52:47.584
I see you've already introduced me, Prim.

1044
01:52:48.062 --> 01:52:51.300
Well, I like this one better.
Enough already...

1045
01:52:52.790 --> 01:52:53.534
Damn it!

1046
01:52:54.967 --> 01:52:56.108
The other one is who?

1047
01:52:56.384 --> 01:52:57.565
She was lonely.

1048
01:52:57.820 --> 01:52:59.124
The monster?

1049
01:53:02.425 --> 01:53:06.580
Boom bitch, boom bitch.

1050
01:53:43.336 --> 01:53:45.477
It's hard to be in a position where

1051
01:53:45.518 --> 01:53:48.062
you want to hit someone who's already hurting.

1052
01:53:48.412 --> 01:53:51.223
I'm sure it needs to be looked at.

1053
01:53:52.780 --> 01:53:56.236
It would be better to remain a pile
of meat with a hook in your mouth?

1054
01:53:56.894 --> 01:54:00.152
The more I think about it,
the more I'm leaning towards it.

1055
01:54:01.280 --> 01:54:04.172
- Did I really have a hook in my nose?
- Yes, you did.

1056
01:54:06.211 --> 01:54:08.206
So I'm your creation?

1057
01:54:09.878 --> 01:54:12.445
- Like the other one?
- There isn't one.

1058
01:54:12.870 --> 01:54:17.062
He walks around the house and sings with a hammer
in his hands, I've never done that.

1059
01:54:17.662 --> 01:54:20.300
I have read your letters and cards and with enthusiasm

1060
01:54:20.341 --> 01:54:23.046
I've watched you
you fearlessly created Bella Baxter.

1061
01:54:23.729 --> 01:54:26.984
It is fascinating for me to be
alive, so I forgive your actions.

1062
01:54:28.129 --> 01:54:30.655
But you know I hate lies
and especially what came after.

1063
01:54:31.068 --> 01:54:32.370
I understand.

1064
01:54:37.465 --> 01:54:40.113
- I'm glad to see you again.
- Me too.

1065
01:54:41.458 --> 01:54:44.921
Despite anger, confusion
and inconsistency, I missed you.

1066
01:54:46.211 --> 01:54:49.424
I came home, smelled formaldehyde
and I knew right then and there what was coming.

1067
01:54:52.333 --> 01:54:53.572
I'll be a doctor.

1068
01:54:54.935 --> 01:54:56.736
My operation is yours.

1069
01:54:58.852 --> 01:55:00.258
As my father once told me...

1070
01:55:01.448 --> 01:55:03.684
Always direct with compassion.

1071
01:55:04.501 --> 01:55:05.973
He was a fucking idiot.

1072
01:55:06.415 --> 01:55:08.731
But his advice was good.

1073
01:55:12.035 --> 01:55:13.622
He doesn't have much time left.

1074
01:55:14.674 --> 01:55:15.241
I know.

1075
01:55:17.128 --> 01:55:18.961
You didn't mention our engagement to him.

1076
01:55:20.778 --> 01:55:24.868
You were younger.
I have no reason to do this.

1077
01:55:25.069 --> 01:55:27.998
You intrigued me and I took advantage of it.

1078
01:55:28.130 --> 01:55:32.652
- How long have you been fascinated?
- I'm still fascinated.

1079
01:55:33.862 --> 01:55:36.245
Do you understand that I was a whore?

1080
01:55:36.376 --> 01:55:38.255
Penises in me, for money.

1081
01:55:38.601 --> 01:55:40.148
Are you coping?

1082
01:55:40.714 --> 01:55:44.828
Prostitution repels men
who want to belong.

1083
01:55:45.070 --> 01:55:47.002
Wedderburn has become much
more whiny and sassy

1084
01:55:47.086 --> 01:55:49.309
when he found out about my fornication.

1085
01:55:49.660 --> 01:55:53.161
I'd rather be jealous of
those men who were with you,

1086
01:55:53.539 --> 01:55:56.060
like I'm judging you for anything.

1087
01:55:56.710 --> 01:55:59.846
It's your body, Bella Baxter.
It's up to you how you treat it.

1088
01:56:00.866 --> 01:56:05.013
- I usually charge 30 francs.
- Well, that seems pretty cheap.

1089
01:56:06.408 --> 01:56:08.520
Do you think the man can improve, Max?

1090
01:56:08.975 --> 01:56:12.889
I believe the disease can be cured.

1091
01:56:12.930 --> 01:56:16.594
Men and women complement each other.

1092
01:56:18.795 --> 01:56:20.709
You want me to be yours
wife, Max McCandles?

1093
01:56:22.586 --> 01:56:23.350
Sure.

1094
01:56:30.667 --> 01:56:33.897
Less language in the future,
but it was quite enjoyable.

1095
01:56:34.001 --> 01:56:40.717
I'll keep that in mind.
You've been tested for... diseases?

1096
01:56:41.125 --> 01:56:45.688
Not yet, but I'll look into it.
I'm enjoying our practical love.

1097
01:56:47.018 --> 01:56:50.449
I just want to assure you that I'm passionate too.

1098
01:56:51.489 --> 01:56:54.789
You're adorable. And you always have been.

1099
01:57:04.573 --> 01:57:05.957
God, you came!

1100
01:57:06.041 --> 01:57:10.110
I took five milligrams of heroin
in my toes for the pain...

1101
01:57:10.270 --> 01:57:14.268
and cocaine for energy, because I'm a cocaine addict.

1102
01:57:14.753 --> 01:57:17.604
I have come to escort you to the altar.

1103
01:57:30.119 --> 01:57:34.741
With the authority the church has given me,
I bless this union.

1104
01:57:35.877 --> 01:57:39.658
Do you agree, Bella Baxter, to take
this man as your lawful wedded husband?

1105
01:57:39.818 --> 01:57:42.432
Do you overlook those who object?

1106
01:57:43.078 --> 01:57:48.048
Or has that already been removed from the catechism?

1107
01:57:51.146 --> 01:57:52.612
It's been a while, Victoria.

1108
01:57:53.306 --> 01:57:54.527
You seem to be doing well.

1109
01:57:55.343 --> 01:57:57.194
Are you talking to me, sir?

1110
01:57:57.502 --> 01:58:01.781
Normally a husband to his wife
doesn't introduce himself to his wife, but if necessary...

1111
01:58:03.183 --> 01:58:04.367
It's Godwin!

1112
01:58:05.129 --> 01:58:09.297
Is it under his control?
Or was it the hand of the devil?

1113
01:58:09.523 --> 01:58:12.782
Look! He's bleeding in the sacred house!

1114
01:58:12.824 --> 01:58:15.065
You have cancer, you fucking idiot.

1115
01:58:16.654 --> 01:58:19.587
- Duncan.
- Don't look at me, you demon!

1116
01:58:21.927 --> 01:58:25.340
So I'm General Alfred Blessington.

1117
01:58:25.863 --> 01:58:27.249
For you, Alfie.

1118
01:58:27.819 --> 01:58:29.571
You really don't recognize me?

1119
01:58:30.265 --> 01:58:33.626
When Mr Wedderburn
put your picture in the paper...

1120
01:58:33.667 --> 01:58:37.068
I remember seeing you at the hotel
they called you Victoria Blessington!

1121
01:58:37.069 --> 01:58:41.633
After your diabolical orgiastic ritual!

1122
01:58:43.154 --> 01:58:45.299
- Then you...
- My dear Alfie.

1123
01:58:45.505 --> 01:58:50.597
You fled in a very bad state of mind.
You were pregnant at the time.

1124
01:58:51.370 --> 01:58:54.344
When I discovered your absence,
I was like a broken glass.

1125
01:58:54.785 --> 01:58:58.372
I was devastated.
I felt like a loser on the battlefield.

1126
01:58:59.196 --> 01:59:01.803
A dull, throbbing pain in the heart.

1127
01:59:02.252 --> 01:59:04.207
So it was.

1128
01:59:05.309 --> 01:59:09.587
It hurts me, it's not an appropriate metaphor.

1129
01:59:11.273 --> 01:59:15.020
But you're here now, darling are you?

1130
01:59:15.388 --> 01:59:18.240
- Oh, my God...
- I don't recognize you at all.

1131
01:59:19.096 --> 01:59:20.603
I'm Bella Baxter.

1132
01:59:20.970 --> 01:59:26.389
Terrible, you hurt yourself very badly
your head and these two took advantage of it.

1133
01:59:26.477 --> 01:59:28.152
Please leave, sir.

1134
01:59:29.854 --> 01:59:30.732
You were my husband.

1135
01:59:31.525 --> 01:59:33.480
- Your dear Alfie.
- Bella.

1136
01:59:33.521 --> 01:59:34.394
I'm sorry.

1137
01:59:40.326 --> 01:59:42.199
Actually, I'd like to leave.

1138
01:59:42.404 --> 01:59:44.115
- What?
- Bella?

1139
01:59:48.231 --> 01:59:49.820
Have you come in the carriage, sir?

1140
01:59:52.004 --> 01:59:53.633
- So, let's go.
- Bella!

1141
01:59:54.058 --> 01:59:57.888
Let me go, God.
Max, won't you stop me?

1142
02:00:06.667 --> 02:00:08.418
Glad to have you back, Victoria.

1143
02:00:25.001 --> 02:00:26.793
We haven't gotten along with the ministry in a long time.

1144
02:00:26.876 --> 02:00:28.724
I'm afraid of a revolt.

1145
02:00:37.928 --> 02:00:39.516
Remember David, sweetheart?

1146
02:00:41.626 --> 02:00:43.867
Alison, look who's back.

1147
02:00:50.184 --> 02:00:51.486
You know me.

1148
02:00:53.086 --> 02:00:54.500
Tell me about me.

1149
02:00:57.070 --> 02:00:58.740
Have I been nice to you?

1150
02:01:34.641 --> 02:01:37.940
Eat. Everything you like.

1151
02:01:38.307 --> 02:01:42.973
Herring, goose, tongue, champagne.

1152
02:01:44.368 --> 02:01:45.205
I missed you.

1153
02:01:47.395 --> 02:01:53.181
What was the root of the misfortune?
What made me jump off the bridge?

1154
02:01:56.171 --> 02:01:59.307
You hated that boy.
You called him a monster.

1155
02:02:00.734 --> 02:02:05.304
I see. The missing maternal instinct

1156
02:02:07.213 --> 02:02:08.794
I'm glad you're home anyway.

1157
02:02:11.521 --> 02:02:14.308
- Where did we meet?
- We danced together.

1158
02:02:14.955 --> 02:02:19.432
- Why did we like each other?
- We shared many beautiful moments.

1159
02:02:21.411 --> 02:02:22.388
What?

1160
02:02:23.716 --> 02:02:25.712
Alison! Alison! Soup.

1161
02:02:35.727 --> 02:02:36.786
Laugh!

1162
02:02:41.850 --> 02:02:42.663
Damn it!

1163
02:02:42.909 --> 02:02:43.656
Alison.

1164
02:02:44.498 --> 02:02:46.453
Bring in as much cheese as you can.

1165
02:02:52.746 --> 02:02:54.701
You love cruelty.

1166
02:02:56.412 --> 02:02:58.310
You don't seem like a nice person.

1167
02:02:59.621 --> 02:03:02.996
"Dear"? You've never been so
boring, Victoria. Terrible idea.

1168
02:03:04.192 --> 02:03:07.292
Wedderburn said he thought
you were a prostitute. I suspect you think...

1169
02:03:07.333 --> 02:03:08.457
I was in Paris.

1170
02:03:08.865 --> 02:03:11.269
I worked there part-time.
It was fascinating.

1171
02:03:13.159 --> 02:03:15.521
- Yeah.
- Surprisingly tasty herring.

1172
02:03:16.215 --> 02:03:18.050
Vinegar or whatever...

1173
02:03:24.773 --> 02:03:26.850
Marriage is a constant struggle.

1174
02:03:27.624 --> 02:03:29.960
We bow down to someone,
we bow to somebody we don't bow to.

1175
02:03:32.473 --> 02:03:34.738
I'll try to forgive you for that fornication.

1176
02:03:35.326 --> 02:03:37.774
Your sexual hysteria
was often impossible.

1177
02:03:39.034 --> 02:03:41.016
Also the murder of our unborn child.

1178
02:03:41.927 --> 02:03:44.389
If I had to name
all your transgressions against me,

1179
02:03:44.620 --> 02:03:48.397
he'd probably hit you with a bat
on the head by Jesus Christ himself.

1180
02:03:52.134 --> 02:03:53.507
He was sent to you
an all-forgiving husband.

1181
02:03:55.540 --> 02:03:59.181
I didn't hurt you, Alfie.
I don't even know you properly.

1182
02:03:59.287 --> 02:04:03.034
You're lucky with memory loss
on the battlefield, I have a lot of experience.

1183
02:04:03.443 --> 02:04:06.810
If near the forgotten
of a forgotten man, a bomb goes off...

1184
02:04:06.892 --> 02:04:10.119
ringing in his ears just like
church bells in Ukraine.

1185
02:04:11.225 --> 02:04:15.208
I suggest you stay close
home for a few months, maybe a year.

1186
02:04:18.071 --> 02:04:19.709
Until you're fully recovered.

1187
02:04:22.349 --> 02:04:25.962
I'll go wherever I want, but
I'm flattered by your desire to imprison me.

1188
02:04:27.856 --> 02:04:29.118
You're not the first.

1189
02:04:31.151 --> 02:04:35.244
If you try to leave,
I'll have to shoot you in the head.

1190
02:04:35.715 --> 02:04:37.473
In the forehead or back of the neck?

1191
02:04:37.711 --> 02:04:38.688
To the back of the neck.

1192
02:04:39.063 --> 02:04:41.801
Still sure you want to leave?

1193
02:04:47.996 --> 02:04:49.422
I missed you.

1194
02:04:53.115 --> 02:04:54.581
Am I your prisoner, then?

1195
02:04:55.905 --> 02:04:59.001
This conversation took a bad turn.

1196
02:04:59.498 --> 02:05:02.798
I'm sure you'll be as happy as before.

1197
02:05:03.765 --> 02:05:06.494
Like before I jumped off that bridge?

1198
02:05:12.485 --> 02:05:14.968
I think you fell off looking at the fish.

1199
02:05:16.764 --> 02:05:19.487
Why do you want to keep me,
if I don't want to stay here?

1200
02:05:19.983 --> 02:05:24.016
If you want to drown,
let it be in the river of love.

1201
02:05:33.711 --> 02:05:34.688
David.

1202
02:05:35.979 --> 02:05:37.886
Does a pheasant look like a gnawed bone?

1203
02:05:38.523 --> 02:05:40.331
I was wrong, sir.

1204
02:05:40.968 --> 02:05:42.231
I'm sorry.

1205
02:05:50.707 --> 02:05:52.540
Dessert, honey?

1206
02:06:53.867 --> 02:06:56.088
Easy to set up like a breeze.

1207
02:06:56.681 --> 02:06:59.184
It's a precision machine,
that can destroy rocks.

1208
02:07:02.160 --> 02:07:04.468
Just a little squeeze or up to the head?

1209
02:07:05.249 --> 02:07:07.888
- Down to the root
- I'll try

1210
02:07:09.214 --> 02:07:10.843
This time we will succeed.

1211
02:07:11.541 --> 02:07:14.555
I'll get the sleeping pills,
there's an operation tonight.

1212
02:07:24.366 --> 02:07:26.365
Victory! Darling!

1213
02:07:27.922 --> 02:07:28.939
Where are you?

1214
02:07:34.278 --> 02:07:36.763
Just in time.
Martini, you're on.

1215
02:07:36.927 --> 02:07:38.108
I'm not asking.

1216
02:07:38.616 --> 02:07:40.367
But I'd like to leave.

1217
02:07:41.024 --> 02:07:45.463
Our time together was fun, but there was
I figured out why I jumped off a bridge.

1218
02:07:46.400 --> 02:07:48.844
I want to see my God half-dead.

1219
02:07:49.518 --> 02:07:52.053
The idea is brilliant. Alas, my dear,

1220
02:07:52.300 --> 02:07:54.965
my job is to secure the territory.

1221
02:07:55.508 --> 02:07:58.400
You're all mine and that's the whole story.

1222
02:07:59.066 --> 02:08:00.491
I'm not your territory.

1223
02:08:00.766 --> 02:08:04.268
The root of the problem is between your legs.

1224
02:08:04.514 --> 02:08:08.140
We'll remove him and you'll never be
distract or derail you ever again.

1225
02:08:08.629 --> 02:08:11.684
You see, a man struggles his whole life with
his sexual desires.

1226
02:08:11.685 --> 02:08:14.781
It's a curse, but
it's also his life's work.

1227
02:08:15.027 --> 02:08:16.900
A woman's life's work is her children.

1228
02:08:17.146 --> 02:08:19.812
I intend to liberate
you from this hell between

1229
02:08:19.894 --> 02:08:22.003
with your feet, and right after that
I'll plant a seed in you.

1230
02:08:22.974 --> 02:08:24.427
Let me explain to you what happened.

1231
02:08:25.051 --> 02:08:28.467
Victoria, your wife,
jumped off a bridge and died.

1232
02:08:28.800 --> 02:08:31.977
Godwin Baxter found it
and took her into surgery.

1233
02:08:31.978 --> 02:08:37.808
Then he pulled the baby out, took his brains out and
transplanted it into her head, and that brought me back to life.

1234
02:08:38.254 --> 02:08:40.622
I'll bring you his notes,
they're quite interesting.

1235
02:08:41.024 --> 02:08:44.999
But I want to keep my new
life and my old clit, thank you.

1236
02:08:45.788 --> 02:08:47.219
Can I have a carriage?

1237
02:08:47.789 --> 02:08:51.700
Thank you for the great interview but to me
I have no choice but to point the gun.

1238
02:08:53.086 --> 02:08:54.512
That's the only way to end it.

1239
02:09:07.307 --> 02:09:08.569
Will you serve me?

1240
02:09:08.978 --> 02:09:11.585
You better shoot me right in the heart.

1241
02:09:12.006 --> 02:09:14.613
I'll fucking shoot you if I have to.

1242
02:09:15.946 --> 02:09:17.861
Drink your drinks, sweetheart.

1243
02:09:18.350 --> 02:09:20.183
Chloroform with gin.

1244
02:09:29.285 --> 02:09:32.724
In a sense it gives me peace of mind
and it allows me to explore myself.

1245
02:09:33.442 --> 02:09:35.717
Drink up and you'll be free.

1246
02:09:48.356 --> 02:09:49.373
Shit!

1247
02:10:03.677 --> 02:10:04.776
Max!

1248
02:10:07.792 --> 02:10:08.810
Max.

1249
02:10:09.029 --> 02:10:10.903
I've got to get Alfie to the operating theatre.

1250
02:10:11.964 --> 02:10:14.233
If we don't do it, it will die.
He's bleeding a lot.

1251
02:10:14.381 --> 02:10:16.281
You're a dead man.

1252
02:10:17.669 --> 02:10:22.639
Bella, if he's still alive I don't think it's
the kind of man we should be helping.

1253
02:10:23.210 --> 02:10:24.644
But I don't want to kill him.

1254
02:10:25.416 --> 02:10:27.105
But I agree, there is still room for improvement.

1255
02:10:40.162 --> 02:10:42.320
I pulled the bullet out and stopped the bleeding.

1256
02:10:42.723 --> 02:10:43.664
You got the notes.

1257
02:10:51.898 --> 02:10:54.301
I'm happiest just being here with you.

1258
02:11:26.447 --> 02:11:28.760
Bella you came back.

1259
02:11:35.050 --> 02:11:40.061
This was someone else's story.
Not Bella Baxter's.

1260
02:11:47.683 --> 02:11:52.611
My whole life has been on me
people have looked at me with pity.

1261
02:11:54.291 --> 02:11:55.161
And you...

1262
02:12:02.964 --> 02:12:08.424
Everything that happens is very interesting...

1263
02:13:03.978 --> 02:13:04.995
Thank you.

1264
02:13:07.334 --> 02:13:09.411
Before the anatomy exam
I was kind of nervous.

1265
02:13:09.576 --> 02:13:11.970
I've tested you many times.
You know it.

1266
02:13:13.242 --> 02:13:16.175
No one knows anatomy better than you.
I swear.

1267
02:13:16.373 --> 02:13:18.002
That's for sure.

1268
02:13:19.634 --> 02:13:21.262
Ladies, would you like a gin?

1269
02:13:21.841 --> 02:13:22.981
Please.

1270
02:13:23.226 --> 02:13:24.284
Geneva?

1271
02:13:26.812 --> 02:13:28.971
We should give him artesian water.

1272
02:13:35.166 --> 02:13:36.265
Happiness.

1273
02:13:37.366 --> 02:13:38.424
Water.

1274
