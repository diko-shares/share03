00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:20.701
Hello.

2
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.329
My name's Forrest. Forrest Gump.

3
00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:31.920
Do you want a chocolate?

4
00:03:34.506 --> 00:03:37.926
I could eat about
a million and a half of these.

5
00:03:39.094 --> 00:03:44.307
My mama always said
life was like a box of chocolates.

6
00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:49.187
You never know what you're gonna get.

7
00:03:56.403 --> 00:03:58.947
Those must be comfortable shoes.

8
00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:04.995
I'll bet you could walk all day
in shoes like that and not feel a thing.

9
00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:09.666
I wish I had shoes like that.

10
00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:11.877
My feet hurt.

11
00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:14.755
Mama always said there's an awful lot

12
00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:18.049
you could tell about a person
by their shoes:

13
00:04:19.176 --> 00:04:22.137
where they're going,
where they've been.

14
00:04:29.394 --> 00:04:31.438
I've worn lots of shoes.

15
00:04:34.566 --> 00:04:39.362
I bet if I think about it real hard,
I could remember my first pair of shoes.

16
00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:44.910
Mama said they'd take me anywhere.

17
00:04:45.702 --> 00:04:48.330
She said they was my magic shoes.

18
00:04:48.413 --> 00:04:51.583
All right, Forrest,
you can open your eyes now.

19
00:04:58.882 --> 00:05:01.343
Let's take a little walk around.

20
00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:09.935
How do those feel?

21
00:05:12.896 --> 00:05:15.065
His legs are strong, Mrs. Gump,

22
00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:17.651
as strong as I've ever seen,

23
00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:21.112
but his back is as crooked
as a politician.

24
00:05:22.405 --> 00:05:25.534
But we're gonna straighten him right up,
now, aren't we, Forrest?

25
00:05:25.575 --> 00:05:26.701
Forrest!

26
00:05:28.203 --> 00:05:29.412
Now, when I was a baby,

27
00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:32.332
Mama named me after
the great Civil War hero,

28
00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:34.835
General Nathan Bedford Forrest.

29
00:05:34.918 --> 00:05:37.128
She said we was related to him
in some way.

30
00:05:37.212 --> 00:05:38.588
And what he did was,

31
00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:42.926
he started up this club called
the Ku Klux Klan.

32
00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:46.346
They'd all dress up in their robes
and their bed sheets

33
00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:50.767
and act like a bunch of ghosts
or spooks or something.

34
00:05:50.851 --> 00:05:54.729
They'd even put bed sheets
on their horses and ride around.

35
00:05:54.813 --> 00:05:57.858
And anyway, that's how I got my name,

36
00:05:57.941 --> 00:05:59.359
Forrest Gump.

37
00:05:59.442 --> 00:06:01.194
Mama said that the "Forrest" part

38
00:06:01.278 --> 00:06:04.823
was to remind me that sometimes
we all do things that,

39
00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:07.701
well, just don't make no sense.

40
00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:16.877
Okay... Get it, get it...

41
00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.921
Wait, is it this way? Hold on.

42
00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:22.340
All right...

43
00:06:22.924 --> 00:06:24.593
What are you all staring at?

44
00:06:24.676 --> 00:06:29.139
Haven't you ever seen a little boy
with braces on his legs before?

45
00:06:30.682 --> 00:06:34.394
Don't ever let anybody tell you
they're better than you, Forrest.

46
00:06:34.477 --> 00:06:37.063
If God intended
everybody to be the same,

47
00:06:37.147 --> 00:06:39.274
he'd have given us all braces
on our legs.

48
00:06:39.357 --> 00:06:43.153
Mama always had a way of explaining
things so I could understand them.

49
00:06:44.613 --> 00:06:48.116
We lived about a quarter mile
off Route 17,

50
00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:51.244
about a half mile from
the town of Greenbow, Alabama.

51
00:06:51.328 --> 00:06:54.080
That's in the county of Greenbow.

52
00:06:54.164 --> 00:06:58.585
Our house had been in Mama's family
since her grandpa's grandpa's grandpa

53
00:06:58.668 --> 00:07:00.587
had come across the ocean
about 1,000 years ago,

54
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.589
something like that.

55
00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:05.383
Since it was just me and Mama
and we had all these empty rooms,

56
00:07:05.467 --> 00:07:08.219
Mama decided to let those rooms out,

57
00:07:08.303 --> 00:07:10.263
mostly to people passing through,

58
00:07:10.347 --> 00:07:14.309
like from, oh, Mobile,
Montgomery, places like that.

59
00:07:14.392 --> 00:07:17.103
That's how me and Mama got money.

60
00:07:17.187 --> 00:07:19.940
Mama was a real smart lady.

61
00:07:20.023 --> 00:07:25.028
Remember what I told you, Forrest.
You're no different than anybody else is.

62
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.908
Did you hear what I said, Forrest?

63
00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:34.162
You're the same as everybody else.
You are no different.

64
00:07:34.663 --> 00:07:39.125
Your boy's different, Mrs. Gump.

65
00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:41.419
Now, his IQ is 75.

66
00:07:42.212 --> 00:07:45.340
Well, we're all different, Mr. Hancock.

67
00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:50.971
She wanted me to have
the finest education,

68
00:07:51.054 --> 00:07:54.975
so she took me to
the Greenbow County Central School.

69
00:07:55.058 --> 00:07:57.310
I met the principal and all.

70
00:07:57.811 --> 00:08:00.689
I want to show you something,
Mrs. Gump.

71
00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:04.025
Now, this is normal.

72
00:08:04.526 --> 00:08:07.821
Forrest is right here.

73
00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:14.202
The state requires a minimum IQ of
80 to attend public school, Mrs. Gump.

74
00:08:14.703 --> 00:08:17.580
He's gonna have to go
to a special school.

75
00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:19.791
Now, he'll be just fine.

76
00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:22.669
What does "normal" mean, anyway?

77
00:08:22.752 --> 00:08:26.131
He might be a bit on the slow side,

78
00:08:27.257 --> 00:08:29.050
but my boy Forrest is gonna get

79
00:08:29.092 --> 00:08:31.636
the same opportunities
as everyone else.

80
00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:35.515
He's not going to some special school
to learn how to re-tread tires.

81
00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:38.768
We're talking about
five little points here.

82
00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:43.106
There must be something can be done.

83
00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:47.152
We're a progressive school system.

84
00:08:47.986 --> 00:08:50.905
We don't want to see anybody
left behind.

85
00:08:51.781 --> 00:08:55.243
Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?

86
00:08:58.496 --> 00:09:00.373
He's on vacation.

87
00:09:17.849 --> 00:09:21.644
Well, your mama sure does care
about your schooling, son.

88
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.611
You don't say much, do you?

89
00:09:41.122 --> 00:09:43.083
"Finally, he had to try.

90
00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:45.126
"It looked easy, but,

91
00:09:46.336 --> 00:09:48.671
"oh, what happened.

92
00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:51.758
- "First, there..."
- Mama, what's "vacation" mean?

93
00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.886
- Vacation?
- Where Daddy went.

94
00:09:57.514 --> 00:10:00.225
Vacation's when you go somewhere

95
00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:04.938
and you don't ever come back.

96
00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:13.071
Anyway, I guess you could say
me and Mama was on our own.

97
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.909
But we didn't mind.
Our house was never empty.

98
00:10:17.992 --> 00:10:20.578
There was always folks
coming and going.

99
00:10:20.662 --> 00:10:21.746
Supper.

100
00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:25.250
- It's supper, everyone. Forrest...
- My, my. That sure looks special.

101
00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:27.877
Sometimes we had
so many people staying with us

102
00:10:27.961 --> 00:10:30.630
that every room
was filled with travelers.

103
00:10:30.713 --> 00:10:34.342
You know, folks living out
of their suitcases

104
00:10:34.425 --> 00:10:37.387
and hat cases and sample cases.

105
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:40.890
Forrest Gump, it's suppertime!
Forrest...

106
00:10:40.974 --> 00:10:43.518
One time, a young man
was staying with us,

107
00:10:43.601 --> 00:10:47.230
and he had him a guitar case.

108
00:11:01.202 --> 00:11:05.206
Forrest! I told you not to bother
this nice young man.

109
00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:06.624
Oh, no, that's all right, ma'am.

110
00:11:06.708 --> 00:11:09.544
I was just showing him a thing or two
on the guitar here.

111
00:11:09.627 --> 00:11:12.589
All right, but your supper's ready
if y'all want to eat.

112
00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:15.633
Yeah, that sounds good.
Thank you, ma'am.

113
00:11:16.301 --> 00:11:19.888
Say, man, show me that crazy
little walk you just did there.

114
00:11:19.971 --> 00:11:21.848
Slow it down some.

115
00:11:23.975 --> 00:11:25.894
I liked that guitar.

116
00:11:26.561 --> 00:11:28.313
It sounded good.

117
00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:34.277
I started moving around to the music,

118
00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.196
swinging my hips.

119
00:11:38.781 --> 00:11:41.326
This one night,
me and Mama was out shopping,

120
00:11:41.409 --> 00:11:44.412
and we walked right by
Benson's furniture and appliance store,

121
00:11:44.495 --> 00:11:46.080
and guess what?

122
00:11:58.426 --> 00:12:01.262
This is not for children's eyes.

123
00:12:03.806 --> 00:12:05.642
Some years later,
that handsome young man

124
00:12:05.683 --> 00:12:08.269
who they called "The King,"

125
00:12:08.311 --> 00:12:10.647
well, he'd sung too many songs,

126
00:12:11.314 --> 00:12:13.858
had himself a heart attack,
or something.

127
00:12:14.943 --> 00:12:17.111
Must be hard being a king.

128
00:12:21.407 --> 00:12:24.447
You know, it's funny how you remember
some things, but some things you can't.

129
00:12:24.994 --> 00:12:28.873
- You do your very best now, Forrest.
- I sure will, Mama.

130
00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:35.171
I remember the bus ride
on the first day of school very well.

131
00:12:38.716 --> 00:12:40.426
Are you coming along?

132
00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:44.013
Mama said not to be taking
rides from strangers.

133
00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:46.266
This is the bus to school.

134
00:12:49.227 --> 00:12:51.479
I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.

135
00:12:52.438 --> 00:12:56.442
- I'm Dorothy Harris.
- Well, now we ain't strangers anymore.

136
00:13:09.455 --> 00:13:11.249
This seat's taken.

137
00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:15.211
It's taken!

138
00:13:23.094 --> 00:13:24.971
You can't sit here.

139
00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:30.560
You know, it's funny what
a young man recollects,

140
00:13:30.643 --> 00:13:33.021
'cause I don't remember being born.

141
00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:36.858
I don't recall what I got
for my first Christmas,

142
00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:39.986
and I don't know when I went
on my first outdoor picnic.

143
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:44.782
But I do remember the first time I heard

144
00:13:44.866 --> 00:13:47.702
the sweetest voice in the wide world.

145
00:13:48.202 --> 00:13:50.580
You can sit here if you want.

146
00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:57.378
I had never seen anything
so beautiful in my life.

147
00:13:58.087 --> 00:14:00.173
She was like an angel.

148
00:14:00.256 --> 00:14:03.176
Well, are you gonna sit down,
or aren't you?

149
00:14:08.139 --> 00:14:09.932
What's wrong with your legs?

150
00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:14.270
Nothing at all, thank you.
My legs are just fine and dandy.

151
00:14:15.188 --> 00:14:17.357
I just sat next to her on that bus

152
00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.525
and had a conversation
all the way to school.

153
00:14:19.609 --> 00:14:22.320
My back's crooked like
a question mark.

154
00:14:22.403 --> 00:14:23.613
These are going to make me...

155
00:14:23.654 --> 00:14:28.409
And next to Mama, no one ever
talked to me or asked me questions.

156
00:14:28.951 --> 00:14:30.912
Are you stupid or something?

157
00:14:30.995 --> 00:14:33.998
Mama says, "Stupid is as stupid does."

158
00:14:35.625 --> 00:14:39.295
- I'm Jenny.
- I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.

159
00:14:39.962 --> 00:14:41.798
From that day on,
we was always together.

160
00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:44.717
Jenny and me was like
peas and carrots.

161
00:14:48.304 --> 00:14:49.931
She taught me how to climb.

162
00:14:50.014 --> 00:14:52.725
Come on, Forrest, you can do it.

163
00:14:52.809 --> 00:14:55.436
I showed her how to dangle.

164
00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.563
"a good little monkey and..."

165
00:14:57.647 --> 00:15:02.568
She helped me learn how to read,
and I showed her how to swing.

166
00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:08.658
Sometimes we'd just sit out
and wait for the stars.

167
00:15:08.741 --> 00:15:13.663
- Mama's gonna worry about me.
- Just stay a little longer.

168
00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:18.668
For some reason,
Jenny didn't never want to go home.

169
00:15:18.751 --> 00:15:20.837
Okay, Jenny, I'll stay.

170
00:15:21.671 --> 00:15:24.424
She was my most special friend.

171
00:15:27.844 --> 00:15:29.512
My only friend.

172
00:15:33.307 --> 00:15:37.103
Now, my mama always told me that
miracles happen every day.

173
00:15:37.186 --> 00:15:39.564
Some people don't think so, but they do.

174
00:15:42.608 --> 00:15:44.193
Hey, dummy!

175
00:15:45.153 --> 00:15:47.238
Are you retarded, or just plain stupid?

176
00:15:47.321 --> 00:15:50.825
- "Look, I'm Forrest Gimp."
- Just run away, Forrest.

177
00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.246
Run, Forrest! Run away! Hurry!

178
00:15:55.329 --> 00:15:58.583
- Get the bikes!
- Hurry up! Let's get him!

179
00:15:58.666 --> 00:16:01.210
- Come on!
- Look out, dummy, here we come!

180
00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:03.129
We're gonna get you!

181
00:16:04.088 --> 00:16:07.842
Run, Forrest, run! Run, Forrest!

182
00:16:09.552 --> 00:16:11.471
Come back here, you!

183
00:16:25.109 --> 00:16:27.570
Run, Forrest!

184
00:16:27.653 --> 00:16:29.071
Run!

185
00:17:00.269 --> 00:17:03.147
Now, you wouldn't believe it
if I told you,

186
00:17:04.273 --> 00:17:06.776
but I can run like the wind blows.

187
00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:13.115
From that day on,
if I was going somewhere,

188
00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:15.284
I was running!

189
00:17:15.326 --> 00:17:17.703
He's getting away! Stop him!

190
00:17:49.151 --> 00:17:52.154
That boy sure is a running fool.

191
00:17:56.367 --> 00:17:57.743
Now, remember how I told you that

192
00:17:57.827 --> 00:18:00.788
Jenny never seemed
to want to go home?

193
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:03.916
Well, she lived in a house
that was as old as Alabama.

194
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.168
Her mama had gone up to heaven
when she was five,

195
00:18:06.252 --> 00:18:09.589
and her daddy was
some kind of a farmer.

196
00:18:11.424 --> 00:18:12.508
Jenny?

197
00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:14.719
He was a very loving man.

198
00:18:15.177 --> 00:18:19.432
He was always kissing and touching
her and her sisters.

199
00:18:21.183 --> 00:18:25.605
And then this one time,
Jenny wasn't on the bus to go to school.

200
00:18:26.772 --> 00:18:29.692
Jenny, why didn't you come
to school today?

201
00:18:29.734 --> 00:18:31.819
Daddy's taking a nap.

202
00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:33.571
- Jenny!
- Come on!

203
00:18:35.031 --> 00:18:37.575
Jenny, where'd you run to?

204
00:18:38.909 --> 00:18:41.579
You'd better get back here, girl!

205
00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:44.707
Where you at?

206
00:18:48.085 --> 00:18:51.380
Jenny! Jenny! Where you at?

207
00:18:54.383 --> 00:18:55.718
Jenny!

208
00:18:55.801 --> 00:18:58.763
Pray with me, Forrest. Pray with me.

209
00:18:58.888 --> 00:19:00.056
Jenny!

210
00:19:00.097 --> 00:19:03.309
Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far,

211
00:19:03.392 --> 00:19:05.144
far, far away from here.

212
00:19:05.227 --> 00:19:08.898
Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far,

213
00:19:08.981 --> 00:19:10.107
far, far away from here.

214
00:19:10.232 --> 00:19:13.277
Mama always said
that God is mysterious.

215
00:19:13.402 --> 00:19:14.570
Jenny!

216
00:19:14.612 --> 00:19:16.947
He didn't turn Jenny into a bird that day.

217
00:19:17.073 --> 00:19:18.157
You'd better get back here!

218
00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.742
Instead,

219
00:19:20.409 --> 00:19:24.955
he had the police say Jenny didn't
have to stay in that house no more.

220
00:19:25.414 --> 00:19:29.126
She went to live with her grandma
just over on Creekmore Avenue,

221
00:19:29.251 --> 00:19:32.421
which made me happy,
'cause she was so close.

222
00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:40.096
Some nights, Jenny would sneak out
and come on over to my house,

223
00:19:40.137 --> 00:19:43.265
just 'cause she said she was scared.

224
00:19:43.349 --> 00:19:45.810
Scared of what, I don't know,

225
00:19:45.935 --> 00:19:49.146
but I think it was her grandma's dog.

226
00:19:49.271 --> 00:19:51.023
He was a mean dog.

227
00:19:51.774 --> 00:19:54.485
Anyway, Jenny and me was best friends

228
00:19:54.568 --> 00:19:55.968
all the way up through high school.

229
00:19:57.822 --> 00:19:59.865
- Hey, stupid!
- Quit it!

230
00:20:00.991 --> 00:20:03.285
- Run, Forrest, run!
- Hey,

231
00:20:03.994 --> 00:20:05.454
did you hear me, stupid?

232
00:20:05.538 --> 00:20:06.807
- Run, Forrest!
- Come on, get in the truck!

233
00:20:06.831 --> 00:20:08.958
Get in the truck! Let's move it!

234
00:20:09.041 --> 00:20:11.794
Come on, he's getting away! Move it!

235
00:20:11.877 --> 00:20:14.046
Run, Forrest! Run!

236
00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:17.675
- You better be running, stupid!
- Come on, dummy!

237
00:20:19.635 --> 00:20:23.139
- Haul ass, dummy!
- Yeah, you better get running!

238
00:20:26.142 --> 00:20:27.810
Jack rabbit!

239
00:20:36.235 --> 00:20:37.486
Yeah!

240
00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.489
Go! Go! Go!

241
00:20:42.199 --> 00:20:43.826
Run, Forrest!

242
00:20:46.829 --> 00:20:50.416
Now, it used to be,
I ran to get where I was going,

243
00:20:52.001 --> 00:20:54.503
I never thought it would
take me anywhere.

244
00:21:23.532 --> 00:21:27.703
- Who in the hell is that?
- That there is Forrest Gump, Coach.

245
00:21:28.704 --> 00:21:30.539
Just a local idiot.

246
00:21:31.207 --> 00:21:34.710
And can you believe it?
I got to go to college, too.

247
00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.928
Forrest! Forrest! Run!

248
00:21:44.053 --> 00:21:45.638
- Okay!
- Run!

249
00:21:45.721 --> 00:21:49.266
Run, you stupid son of a bitch! Run!

250
00:22:00.736 --> 00:22:04.281
You son of a bitch! Run! Go! Run!

251
00:22:06.659 --> 00:22:09.411
No! Turn! Go!

252
00:22:20.631 --> 00:22:24.260
He must be the stupidest
son of a bitch alive,

253
00:22:24.343 --> 00:22:26.262
but he sure is fast!

254
00:22:29.265 --> 00:22:34.270
Now, maybe it's just me,
but college was very confusing times.

255
00:22:35.604 --> 00:22:37.523
Federal troops enforcing a court order

256
00:22:37.606 --> 00:22:40.609
integrated the University
of Alabama today.

257
00:22:40.693 --> 00:22:41.944
Two negroes were admitted,

258
00:22:41.986 --> 00:22:45.281
but only after Governor George Wallace
had carried out his symbolic threat

259
00:22:45.364 --> 00:22:46.949
to stand in the school house door.

260
00:22:46.991 --> 00:22:51.662
Governor Wallace,
I take it from that statement, that...

261
00:22:51.787 --> 00:22:53.789
Earl, what's going on?

262
00:22:53.873 --> 00:22:57.209
- Coons are trying to get into school.
- Coons?

263
00:22:57.293 --> 00:22:58.973
When raccoons try to get
on our back porch,

264
00:22:59.044 --> 00:23:00.838
Mama just chase them off with a broom.

265
00:23:00.963 --> 00:23:05.467
Not raccoons, you idiot, niggers,
and they want to go to school with us.

266
00:23:05.968 --> 00:23:08.012
With us? They do?

267
00:23:08.971 --> 00:23:11.473
Shortly after Governor Wallace
had carried out his promise

268
00:23:11.557 --> 00:23:12.808
to block the doorway,

269
00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:14.810
President Kennedy
ordered the Secretary of Defense

270
00:23:14.894 --> 00:23:16.896
then to use military force.

271
00:23:16.979 --> 00:23:19.690
Here, by videotape,
is the encounter by General Graham,

272
00:23:19.815 --> 00:23:23.068
commander of the National Guard,
and Governor Wallace.

273
00:23:23.152 --> 00:23:26.864
Because these National Guardsmen
are here today

274
00:23:26.947 --> 00:23:29.491
as federal soldiers for Alabamans.

275
00:23:29.575 --> 00:23:33.495
They live within our borders,
they are all our brothers.

276
00:23:33.579 --> 00:23:35.998
We are winning in this fight,

277
00:23:36.081 --> 00:23:39.084
because we are awakening
the American people

278
00:23:39.168 --> 00:23:42.504
to the dangers that we have spoken
about so many times,

279
00:23:42.588 --> 00:23:48.886
just so evident today, the trend towards
military dictatorship in this country.

280
00:23:52.348 --> 00:23:54.850
And so, at day's end,
the University of Alabama

281
00:23:54.892 --> 00:23:57.186
in Tuscaloosa had been desegregated

282
00:23:57.269 --> 00:24:00.272
and students Jimmy Hood
and Vivian Malone

283
00:24:00.356 --> 00:24:03.442
had been signed up
for summer classes.

284
00:24:06.028 --> 00:24:08.864
Ma'am, you dropped your book.
Ma'am...

285
00:24:09.406 --> 00:24:11.367
Governor Wallace did what
he promised to do.

286
00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:15.037
By being on the Tuscaloosa campus,
he kept the mob from gathering...

287
00:24:15.079 --> 00:24:17.206
Say, wasn't that Gump?

288
00:24:17.289 --> 00:24:21.377
- Nah, that couldn't be.
- It sure as hell was.

289
00:24:26.131 --> 00:24:27.967
A few years later, that angry little man

290
00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:30.552
at the school house door
thought it would be a good idea

291
00:24:30.636 --> 00:24:32.805
and ran for president.

292
00:24:35.891 --> 00:24:38.560
But somebody thought that it wasn't.

293
00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:42.314
But he didn't die.

294
00:24:46.902 --> 00:24:48.570
My bus is here.

295
00:24:49.279 --> 00:24:52.408
- Is it the number nine?
- No, it's the number four.

296
00:24:53.409 --> 00:24:55.577
It was nice talking to you.

297
00:24:58.497 --> 00:25:02.584
I remember when that happened,
when Wallace got shot.

298
00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:04.920
I was in college.

299
00:25:05.004 --> 00:25:06.255
Did you go to a girls' college,

300
00:25:06.296 --> 00:25:08.132
or to a girls-and-boys-together college?

301
00:25:08.257 --> 00:25:09.258
It was co-ed.

302
00:25:09.341 --> 00:25:12.094
'Cause Jenny went to a college
I couldn't go to.

303
00:25:12.136 --> 00:25:14.471
It was a college just for girls.

304
00:25:14.596 --> 00:25:17.766
But I'd go and visit her
every chance I got.

305
00:25:48.464 --> 00:25:49.882
That hurts.

306
00:26:00.893 --> 00:26:03.062
Forrest! Forrest!

307
00:26:05.314 --> 00:26:08.275
- Forrest, stop it! Stop it!
- Jesus!

308
00:26:08.317 --> 00:26:09.485
What are you doing?

309
00:26:09.526 --> 00:26:11.296
- He was hurting you.
- What the hell is going on here?

310
00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:14.990
- No, he's not! Get over there!
- Who is that? Who is that?

311
00:26:15.074 --> 00:26:16.217
- Billy, I'm sorry.
- What the hell?

312
00:26:16.241 --> 00:26:18.827
- Just get away from me!
- Don't...

313
00:26:18.911 --> 00:26:21.872
- Don't go! Billy, wait a second!
- Get away from me.

314
00:26:21.997 --> 00:26:24.166
He doesn't know any better!

315
00:26:25.918 --> 00:26:28.587
Forrest, why did you do that?

316
00:26:31.548 --> 00:26:34.510
I brought you some chocolate.

317
00:26:34.885 --> 00:26:36.595
I'm sorry.

318
00:26:38.764 --> 00:26:42.059
- I'll go back to my college now.
- Forrest...

319
00:26:45.771 --> 00:26:47.356
Look at you.

320
00:26:49.441 --> 00:26:51.527
Come on. Come on.

321
00:26:59.034 --> 00:27:00.911
Is this your room?

322
00:27:05.374 --> 00:27:07.626
Do you ever dream, Forrest,

323
00:27:08.961 --> 00:27:11.797
about who you're gonna be?

324
00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.715
- Who I'm gonna be?
- Yeah.

325
00:27:13.757 --> 00:27:15.634
Aren't I going to be me?

326
00:27:15.717 --> 00:27:19.388
Well, you'll always be you,
just another kind of you.

327
00:27:20.305 --> 00:27:23.559
You know? I want to be famous.

328
00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:28.063
I want to be a singer like Joan Baez.

329
00:27:29.273 --> 00:27:32.401
I just want to be on an empty stage

330
00:27:32.484 --> 00:27:34.778
with my guitar, my voice.

331
00:27:36.613 --> 00:27:38.073
Just me.

332
00:27:39.575 --> 00:27:42.911
And I want to reach people
on the personal level.

333
00:27:45.581 --> 00:27:48.917
I want to be able to say things,
just one-to-one.

334
00:27:56.425 --> 00:27:59.303
Have you ever been with a girl, Forrest?

335
00:28:00.762 --> 00:28:04.600
I sit next to them in my Home
Economics class all the time.

336
00:28:33.545 --> 00:28:35.964
- I'm... Sorry.
- It's okay.

337
00:28:44.514 --> 00:28:46.225
It's all right.

338
00:28:49.061 --> 00:28:51.230
- It's okay.
- Oh, I'm dizzy.

339
00:28:59.905 --> 00:29:02.658
I bet that never happened in Home Ec.

340
00:29:07.496 --> 00:29:08.664
No.

341
00:29:14.878 --> 00:29:18.006
I think I ruined
your roommate's bathrobe.

342
00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:20.175
I don't care. I don't like her, anyway.

343
00:29:20.217 --> 00:29:23.637
Run! Run! Run!

344
00:29:23.679 --> 00:29:28.183
- Run! Run! Run!
- Run! Run! Run!

345
00:29:36.108 --> 00:29:40.362
College ran by real fast,
'cause I played so much football.

346
00:29:40.404 --> 00:29:43.699
They even put me on a thing
called the All-America Team,

347
00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:47.536
where you get to meet
the President of the United States.

348
00:29:47.619 --> 00:29:49.219
President Kennedy met
with the Collegiate

349
00:29:49.288 --> 00:29:52.874
All-American Football Team
at the Oval Office today.

350
00:29:53.458 --> 00:29:55.460
Now, the really good thing
about meeting

351
00:29:55.544 --> 00:29:59.381
the President of the United States
is the food.

352
00:29:59.423 --> 00:30:02.134
They put you in this little room
with just about anything

353
00:30:02.217 --> 00:30:04.720
you'd want to eat or drink.

354
00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:08.724
And since, number one,
I wasn't hungry, but thirsty,

355
00:30:08.765 --> 00:30:11.435
and number two, they was free,

356
00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:14.604
I must have drank me about
15 Dr. Peppers.

357
00:30:17.566 --> 00:30:19.752
Congratulations.
How does it feel to be an All-American?

358
00:30:19.776 --> 00:30:21.570
It's an honor, sir.

359
00:30:21.611 --> 00:30:23.756
Congratulations.
How does it feel to be an All-American?

360
00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:25.407
Very good, sir.

361
00:30:26.241 --> 00:30:28.660
Congratulations.
How does it feel to be an All-American?

362
00:30:28.744 --> 00:30:30.495
Very good, sir.

363
00:30:30.579 --> 00:30:34.249
- Congratulations. How do you feel?
- I gotta pee.

364
00:30:34.916 --> 00:30:37.210
I believe he said he had to "go pee."

365
00:30:52.434 --> 00:30:55.312
Sometime later,
for no particular reason,

366
00:30:55.437 --> 00:30:57.814
somebody shot that
nice young President,

367
00:30:57.939 --> 00:31:00.317
when he was riding in his car.

368
00:31:00.942 --> 00:31:05.113
And a few years after that,
somebody shot his little brother, too,

369
00:31:05.155 --> 00:31:07.282
only he was in a hotel kitchen.

370
00:31:08.742 --> 00:31:11.161
It must be hard being brothers.

371
00:31:12.162 --> 00:31:13.372
I wouldn't know.

372
00:31:13.955 --> 00:31:15.332
Forrest Gump.

373
00:31:15.457 --> 00:31:16.750
Now can you believe it?

374
00:31:16.792 --> 00:31:20.754
After only five years of playing football,
I got a college degree.

375
00:31:20.796 --> 00:31:22.798
Congratulations, son.

376
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:25.634
Mama was so proud.

377
00:31:26.968 --> 00:31:30.806
Forrest, I'm so proud of you.
Here, I'll hold this for you.

378
00:31:30.931 --> 00:31:33.016
Congratulations, son.

379
00:31:33.141 --> 00:31:36.144
Have you given any thought
to your future?

380
00:31:37.979 --> 00:31:39.314
Thought?

381
00:31:40.774 --> 00:31:42.651
Hello, I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.

382
00:31:42.692 --> 00:31:45.695
Nobody gives a hunk of shit
who you are, fuzzball!

383
00:31:45.821 --> 00:31:48.490
You're not even a low-life,
scum-sucking maggot!

384
00:31:48.532 --> 00:31:52.494
Get your faggotty ass on the bus.
You're in the Army now!

385
00:31:52.828 --> 00:31:54.621
This seat's taken.

386
00:31:56.498 --> 00:31:57.874
Taken.

387
00:32:00.794 --> 00:32:03.630
At first, it seemed like I made a mistake,

388
00:32:03.672 --> 00:32:05.715
seeing how it was only
my induction day

389
00:32:05.841 --> 00:32:08.552
and I was already getting yelled at.

390
00:32:11.638 --> 00:32:13.890
You can sit down if you want to.

391
00:32:14.015 --> 00:32:17.853
I didn't know who I might meet,
or what they might ask.

392
00:32:17.978 --> 00:32:20.564
You ever been on a real shrimp boat?

393
00:32:21.064 --> 00:32:24.693
No, but I been on a real big boat.

394
00:32:25.485 --> 00:32:28.321
I'm talking about
a shrimp-catching boat.

395
00:32:28.363 --> 00:32:30.866
I've been working
on shrimp boats all my life.

396
00:32:30.991 --> 00:32:33.743
I started out on my uncle's boat,
that's my mama's brother,

397
00:32:33.869 --> 00:32:35.912
when I was about maybe nine.

398
00:32:36.037 --> 00:32:40.167
I was just looking into buying a boat
of my own and got drafted.

399
00:32:41.001 --> 00:32:45.881
My given name is Benjamin Buford Blue.
People call me Bubba.

400
00:32:46.548 --> 00:32:50.218
Just like one of them old redneck boys.
Can you believe that?

401
00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:53.930
My name's Forrest Gump.
People call me Forrest Gump.

402
00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:57.350
So, Bubba was from
Bayou La Batre, Alabama,

403
00:32:57.392 --> 00:32:59.311
and his mama cooked shrimp,

404
00:33:01.563 --> 00:33:04.441
and her mama before her
cooked shrimp,

405
00:33:04.566 --> 00:33:07.569
and her mama before her mama
cooked shrimp, too.

406
00:33:07.611 --> 00:33:08.862
Bubba's family knew everything

407
00:33:08.904 --> 00:33:11.573
there was to know
about the shrimping business.

408
00:33:11.615 --> 00:33:14.701
I know everything there is to know
about the shrimping business.

409
00:33:14.743 --> 00:33:17.746
Matter of fact, I'm going into
the shrimping business for myself

410
00:33:17.871 --> 00:33:20.207
after I get out the Army.

411
00:33:22.876 --> 00:33:23.919
Okay.

412
00:33:24.127 --> 00:33:28.256
Gump! What's your sole purpose
in this Army?

413
00:33:28.298 --> 00:33:30.884
To do whatever you tell me,
Drill Sergeant!

414
00:33:30.926 --> 00:33:34.304
God damn it, Gump!
You're a goddamn genius!

415
00:33:34.429 --> 00:33:36.765
That's the most outstanding answer
I've ever heard.

416
00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:39.643
You must have a goddamn IQ of 160!

417
00:33:39.768 --> 00:33:42.729
You are goddamn gifted, Private Gump!

418
00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:45.607
Listen up, people!

419
00:33:45.732 --> 00:33:49.945
Now, for some reason, I fit in the Army
like one of them round pegs.

420
00:33:49.986 --> 00:33:51.279
It's not really hard.

421
00:33:51.321 --> 00:33:54.950
You just make your bed real neat
and remember to stand up straight,

422
00:33:55.075 --> 00:33:59.079
and always answer every question
with, "Yes, Drill Sergeant!"

423
00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:00.622
Is that clear?

424
00:34:00.664 --> 00:34:02.791
- Yes, Drill Sergeant!
- Yes, Drill Sergeant!

425
00:34:03.291 --> 00:34:06.628
What you do is, you just drag
your nets along the bottom.

426
00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:10.465
On a good day, you can catch over
100 pounds of shrimp.

427
00:34:10.507 --> 00:34:13.969
If everything goes all right,
two men shrimping 10 hours,

428
00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:16.763
less what you spend on gas, you can...

429
00:34:16.805 --> 00:34:19.599
- Done, Drill Sergeant!
- Gump!

430
00:34:21.977 --> 00:34:24.771
Why did you put that weapon
together so quickly, Gump?

431
00:34:24.813 --> 00:34:26.481
You told me to, Drill Sergeant.

432
00:34:26.606 --> 00:34:30.026
Jesus H. Christ,
this is a new company record.

433
00:34:30.151 --> 00:34:32.654
If it wouldn't be a waste
of such a damn fine enlisted man,

434
00:34:32.696 --> 00:34:34.990
I'd recommend you for OCS,
Private Gump.

435
00:34:35.115 --> 00:34:36.992
You are gonna be
a general some day, Gump.

436
00:34:37.033 --> 00:34:40.120
Now, disassemble your weapon
and continue!

437
00:34:42.205 --> 00:34:46.001
Anyway, like I was saying,
shrimp is the fruit of the sea.

438
00:34:46.084 --> 00:34:50.839
You can barbecue it,
boil it, broil it, bake it, sauté it.

439
00:34:50.922 --> 00:34:53.925
There's shrimp kebabs, shrimp Creole...

440
00:34:54.217 --> 00:34:59.055
shrimp gumbo, pan fried,
deep fried, stir fried.

441
00:34:59.389 --> 00:35:02.934
There's pineapple shrimp,
lemon shrimp,

442
00:35:03.018 --> 00:35:05.353
coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp...

443
00:35:05.687 --> 00:35:11.693
shrimp soup, shrimp stew,
shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes,

444
00:35:11.735 --> 00:35:14.779
shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich...

445
00:35:17.365 --> 00:35:19.701
That's... That's about it.

446
00:35:23.413 --> 00:35:26.374
Night time in the Army is a lonely time.

447
00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:30.879
We'd lay there in our bunks
and I'd miss my mama.

448
00:35:31.463 --> 00:35:33.965
And I'd miss Jenny.

449
00:35:37.886 --> 00:35:41.765
Hey, Gump, get a load of the tits on her!

450
00:35:55.236 --> 00:35:58.406
Turns out, Jenny had gotten into
some trouble over

451
00:35:58.448 --> 00:36:01.785
some photos of her
in her college sweater,

452
00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:04.454
and she was thrown out of school.

453
00:36:07.999 --> 00:36:10.251
But that wasn't a bad thing,

454
00:36:10.293 --> 00:36:13.922
because a man who owns
a theater in Memphis, Tennessee,

455
00:36:13.963 --> 00:36:19.010
saw those photos and offered Jenny
a job singing in a show.

456
00:36:19.803 --> 00:36:21.638
The first chance I got,

457
00:36:21.763 --> 00:36:25.433
I took the bus up to Memphis
to see her perform in that show.

458
00:36:25.517 --> 00:36:27.018
That was Amber, Amber Flame.

459
00:36:27.102 --> 00:36:29.604
Give her a big hand, guys.
Good job, Amber.

460
00:36:29.646 --> 00:36:32.440
And now, for your listening
and viewing pleasure,

461
00:36:32.482 --> 00:36:36.319
direct from Hollywood, California,
our very own beatnik beauty,

462
00:36:36.444 --> 00:36:40.115
let's give a big round of applause
to the luscious Bobbi Dylan.

463
00:36:42.283 --> 00:36:44.953
- All right!
- Bobbi!

464
00:37:07.475 --> 00:37:09.561
Her dream had come true.

465
00:37:10.812 --> 00:37:12.814
She was a folk singer.

466
00:37:22.073 --> 00:37:24.325
Come on, baby. Shake it up.
Shake it up, now.

467
00:37:24.409 --> 00:37:25.910
Hey, buddy, get her a harmonica.

468
00:37:29.664 --> 00:37:31.708
Hey, honey, this ain't Captain Kangaroo.

469
00:37:31.833 --> 00:37:34.377
Hey, honey,
I got something here for you.

470
00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:39.174
- God damn it!
- Hey! Hey! Stupid jerk!

471
00:37:39.257 --> 00:37:41.718
I'm singing a song here.

472
00:37:44.053 --> 00:37:46.514
Polly, get out here!

473
00:37:46.556 --> 00:37:48.266
- Shut up, there!
- Don't be so shy, honey.

474
00:37:48.349 --> 00:37:49.893
Oh, shut up!

475
00:37:52.562 --> 00:37:55.356
Forrest, what are you doing here?

476
00:37:55.398 --> 00:37:57.108
- What are you doing?
- Hey!

477
00:37:57.192 --> 00:37:58.568
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

478
00:37:58.693 --> 00:38:00.695
Forrest, let me down!

479
00:38:06.534 --> 00:38:08.453
You can't keep doing this, Forrest.

480
00:38:08.536 --> 00:38:10.663
You can't keep trying
to rescue me all the time.

481
00:38:10.705 --> 00:38:14.793
- They was trying to grab you.
- A lot of people try to grab me.

482
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:18.880
Just... You can't keep
doing this all the time.

483
00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:22.300
I can't help it. I love you.

484
00:38:23.259 --> 00:38:26.763
Forrest, you don't know what love is.

485
00:38:34.062 --> 00:38:37.065
You remember that time
we prayed, Forrest?

486
00:38:37.941 --> 00:38:42.445
We prayed for God to turn me
into a bird so I could fly far, far away?

487
00:38:44.405 --> 00:38:45.782
Yes, I do.

488
00:38:49.744 --> 00:38:52.580
You think I could fly off this bridge?

489
00:38:59.254 --> 00:39:01.422
What do you mean, Jenny?

490
00:39:05.301 --> 00:39:06.803
Nothing.

491
00:39:09.764 --> 00:39:11.808
I gotta get out of here.

492
00:39:14.102 --> 00:39:15.228
Wait, Jenny...

493
00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:19.774
Forrest, you stay away from me, okay?
You just stay away from me, please.

494
00:39:19.816 --> 00:39:21.109
Can I have a ride?

495
00:39:21.192 --> 00:39:22.777
- Where you going?
- I don't care.

496
00:39:22.819 --> 00:39:24.195
Get in the truck.

497
00:39:24.279 --> 00:39:26.114
So, bye-bye, Jenny.

498
00:39:28.616 --> 00:39:30.952
They sending me to Vietnam.

499
00:39:33.705 --> 00:39:36.124
It's this whole other country.

500
00:39:38.626 --> 00:39:40.628
Just hang on a minute.

501
00:39:42.046 --> 00:39:45.133
Listen, you promise me
something, okay?

502
00:39:45.174 --> 00:39:48.511
Just, if you're ever in trouble,
don't try to be brave. You just run, okay?

503
00:39:48.636 --> 00:39:50.221
Just run away.

504
00:39:51.472 --> 00:39:52.807
Okay.

505
00:39:57.687 --> 00:39:59.022
Jenny.

506
00:40:00.899 --> 00:40:03.192
I'll write you all the time.

507
00:40:12.327 --> 00:40:15.330
And just like that, she was gone.

508
00:40:31.429 --> 00:40:34.766
You come back safe to me,
do you hear?

509
00:41:18.059 --> 00:41:22.063
Now, they told us that Vietnam
was gonna be very different

510
00:41:22.105 --> 00:41:24.983
from the United States of America.

511
00:41:25.066 --> 00:41:30.113
And except for all the beer cans
and the barbecue, it was.

512
00:41:40.248 --> 00:41:43.334
Hey, I bet there's shrimp
all in these waters.

513
00:41:43.418 --> 00:41:46.587
They tell me these Vietnams
is good shrimpers.

514
00:41:46.671 --> 00:41:50.258
You know, after we win this war,
and we take over everything,

515
00:41:50.299 --> 00:41:51.551
we can get American shrimpers

516
00:41:51.592 --> 00:41:53.344
to come out here
and shrimp these waters.

517
00:41:53.428 --> 00:41:54.971
We'll just shrimp all the time, man.

518
00:41:55.096 --> 00:41:58.266
So much shrimp, why,
you wouldn't believe it.

519
00:41:58.933 --> 00:42:00.893
You must be my FNGs.

520
00:42:00.935 --> 00:42:02.186
- Morning, sir!
- Morning, sir!

521
00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:04.939
Get your hands down! Do not salute me.

522
00:42:04.981 --> 00:42:07.108
There's goddamn snipers
all around this area

523
00:42:07.191 --> 00:42:10.028
who would love to grease an officer.

524
00:42:10.111 --> 00:42:13.614
I'm Lieutenant Dan Taylor.
Welcome to Fourth Platoon.

525
00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:16.951
What's wrong with your lip?

526
00:42:16.993 --> 00:42:19.370
I was born with big gums, sir.

527
00:42:19.454 --> 00:42:24.167
Yeah, well, you better tuck that in.
Gonna get that caught on a trip wire.

528
00:42:25.334 --> 00:42:26.711
Where you boys from in the world?

529
00:42:26.794 --> 00:42:29.172
- Alabama, sir!
- Alabama, sir!

530
00:42:29.881 --> 00:42:31.382
You twins?

531
00:42:33.468 --> 00:42:35.887
No, we are not relations, sir.

532
00:42:38.139 --> 00:42:41.059
Look, it's pretty basic here.

533
00:42:41.851 --> 00:42:44.312
If you stick with me
and learn from the guys

534
00:42:44.395 --> 00:42:47.106
who've been in country a while,
you'll be all right.

535
00:42:47.148 --> 00:42:49.108
There is one item of GI gear

536
00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:53.321
that can be the difference between
a live grunt and a dead grunt.

537
00:42:53.654 --> 00:42:56.824
Socks. Cushion sole, OD green.

538
00:42:56.908 --> 00:42:58.201
Try and keep your feet dry.

539
00:42:58.326 --> 00:42:59.803
When we're out humping,
I want you boys to remember

540
00:42:59.827 --> 00:43:02.330
to change your socks
whenever we stop.

541
00:43:02.371 --> 00:43:05.333
The Mekong will eat a grunt's feet
right off his legs.

542
00:43:05.416 --> 00:43:07.710
Sergeant Sims, God damn it,

543
00:43:07.835 --> 00:43:09.313
where is that sling rope
I told you to order?

544
00:43:09.337 --> 00:43:11.255
I put in the requisitions at Battalion.

545
00:43:11.339 --> 00:43:13.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, well,
you call those sons of bitches again...

546
00:43:13.424 --> 00:43:18.346
Lieutenant Dan sure knew his stuff
I felt real lucky he was my lieutenant.

547
00:43:19.097 --> 00:43:22.558
He was from a long,
great military tradition.

548
00:43:22.767 --> 00:43:25.853
Somebody in his family
had fought and died

549
00:43:26.854 --> 00:43:31.109
in every single American war.

550
00:43:32.026 --> 00:43:34.088
- God damn it, kick some ass!
- I'm on it, Lieutenant.

551
00:43:34.112 --> 00:43:35.238
Get on it!

552
00:43:35.363 --> 00:43:38.699
I guess you could say he had
a lot to live up to.

553
00:43:40.409 --> 00:43:45.248
So, you boys are from Arkansas, huh?
Well, I've been through there.

554
00:43:45.373 --> 00:43:47.542
Little Rock's a fine town.

555
00:43:48.209 --> 00:43:51.796
Now, go shake down your gear,
see the platoon sergeant,

556
00:43:51.879 --> 00:43:54.382
draw what you need for the field.

557
00:43:54.423 --> 00:43:58.386
If you boys are hungry,
we got steaks burning right over here.

558
00:43:58.469 --> 00:44:01.389
Two standing orders in this platoon:

559
00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:04.100
one, take good care of your feet,

560
00:44:04.225 --> 00:44:09.272
two, try not to do anything stupid,
like getting yourself killed.

561
00:44:15.736 --> 00:44:17.822
I sure hope I don't let him down.

562
00:44:29.417 --> 00:44:34.338
I got to see a lot of the countryside.
We would take these real long walks.

563
00:44:42.805 --> 00:44:46.934
And we were always looking
for this guy named Charlie.

564
00:44:54.775 --> 00:44:57.028
- Hold it up!
- Hold up, boys!

565
00:44:59.864 --> 00:45:02.200
It wasn't always fun.

566
00:45:02.283 --> 00:45:06.621
Lieutenant Dan was always getting
these funny feelings about a rock,

567
00:45:06.662 --> 00:45:11.792
or a trail, or the road,
so he'd tell us to get down, shut up...

568
00:45:11.834 --> 00:45:13.836
Get down! Shut up!

569
00:45:14.795 --> 00:45:16.255
So we did.

570
00:45:33.814 --> 00:45:35.983
Now, I don't know much about anything,

571
00:45:36.067 --> 00:45:39.904
but I think some of America's
best young men served in this war.

572
00:45:39.987 --> 00:45:42.698
There was Dallas, from Phoenix,

573
00:45:44.408 --> 00:45:47.203
Cleveland, he was from Detroit.

574
00:45:47.328 --> 00:45:49.705
Hey, Tex. Hey, Tex.

575
00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:51.999
Man, what the hell's going on?

576
00:45:52.083 --> 00:45:56.420
And Tex was... Well, I don't remember
where Tex come from.

577
00:45:56.504 --> 00:45:58.047
Nothing.

578
00:46:02.176 --> 00:46:04.679
Fourth Platoon, on your feet.

579
00:46:04.762 --> 00:46:08.516
Still got 10 klicks to go to that river.
Move out.

580
00:46:08.557 --> 00:46:10.351
Come on, move out.

581
00:46:12.395 --> 00:46:14.855
Step it up. Look alive out there.

582
00:46:14.897 --> 00:46:19.235
The good thing about Vietnam
is there was always some place to go.

583
00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:20.736
Fire in the hole!

584
00:46:24.198 --> 00:46:26.534
Gump, check out that hole.

585
00:46:26.617 --> 00:46:29.620
And there was always something to do.

586
00:46:29.704 --> 00:46:32.873
- Mount them up.
- Spread out! Cover his back.

587
00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:43.551
One day, it started raining,
and it didn't quit for four months.

588
00:46:44.552 --> 00:46:47.430
We'd been through
every kind of rain there is:

589
00:46:47.555 --> 00:46:50.099
little bitty stinging rain,

590
00:46:50.808 --> 00:46:53.477
and big old fat rain,

591
00:46:53.936 --> 00:46:56.647
rain that flew in sideways.

592
00:46:56.731 --> 00:47:00.776
And sometimes, rain even seemed
to come straight up from underneath.

593
00:47:02.570 --> 00:47:04.947
Shoot, it even rained at night.

594
00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:08.451
- Hey, Forrest.
- Hey, Bubba.

595
00:47:08.576 --> 00:47:11.912
I'm gonna lean up against you.
You just lean right back against me.

596
00:47:11.954 --> 00:47:15.791
This way, we don't have to sleep
with our heads in the mud.

597
00:47:16.751 --> 00:47:20.254
You know why we a good partnership,
Forrest?

598
00:47:20.296 --> 00:47:22.798
'Cause we be watching out
for one another,

599
00:47:22.923 --> 00:47:24.800
like brothers and stuff.

600
00:47:26.761 --> 00:47:30.431
Hey, Forrest, there's something
I've been thinking about.

601
00:47:30.514 --> 00:47:33.517
I got a very important question
to ask you.

602
00:47:35.144 --> 00:47:39.106
How would you like to go
into the shrimping business with me?

603
00:47:40.274 --> 00:47:41.942
Okay.

604
00:47:41.984 --> 00:47:45.446
Man, I tell you what,
I got it all figured out, too.

605
00:47:45.529 --> 00:47:48.324
So many pounds of shrimp
to pay off the boat,

606
00:47:48.449 --> 00:47:51.786
so many pounds for gas,
we can just live right on the boat.

607
00:47:51.827 --> 00:47:54.121
We ain't got to pay no rent.

608
00:47:54.205 --> 00:47:56.290
I'll be the captain,
we can just work it together,

609
00:47:56.374 --> 00:48:00.628
split everything right down the middle.
Man, I'm telling you, 50-50.

610
00:48:00.711 --> 00:48:04.298
And, hey, Forrest,
all the shrimp you can eat.

611
00:48:05.841 --> 00:48:07.635
That's a fine idea.

612
00:48:08.719 --> 00:48:10.846
Bubba did have a fine idea.

613
00:48:14.642 --> 00:48:17.728
I even wrote Jenny
and told her all about it.

614
00:48:18.521 --> 00:48:21.732
I sent her letters,
not every day, but almost.

615
00:48:21.816 --> 00:48:26.821
I told her what I was doing
and asked her what she was doing,

616
00:48:26.904 --> 00:48:29.657
and told her
how I thought about her always,

617
00:48:30.991 --> 00:48:33.994
and how I was looking forward
to getting a letter from her

618
00:48:34.036 --> 00:48:36.539
just as soon as she had the time.

619
00:48:38.416 --> 00:48:40.918
I'd always let her know that I was okay.

620
00:48:42.211 --> 00:48:47.383
Then, I'd sign each letter,
"Love, Forrest Gump."

621
00:49:02.231 --> 00:49:06.026
This one day, we was out walking,
like always,

622
00:49:06.068 --> 00:49:09.029
and then, just like that,

623
00:49:09.947 --> 00:49:13.367
somebody turned off the rain
and the sun come out.

624
00:49:16.370 --> 00:49:18.205
Ambush!

625
00:49:18.706 --> 00:49:20.082
Take cover!

626
00:49:23.711 --> 00:49:24.879
Get down!

627
00:49:24.962 --> 00:49:26.422
Get the sixty!

628
00:49:29.592 --> 00:49:31.719
Get that pig up here, God damn it!

629
00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:33.888
Forrest, you okay?

630
00:49:37.099 --> 00:49:39.727
Strongarm! Strongarm!
Be advised, Strongarm!

631
00:49:40.269 --> 00:49:42.730
Medic, we got a man down!

632
00:49:42.771 --> 00:49:45.733
Strongarm, this is Leg Lima 6, over!

633
00:49:46.442 --> 00:49:49.778
Roger, Strongarm, be advised
we have incoming from the tree line

634
00:49:49.904 --> 00:49:53.407
at points blue plus two.
AKs and rockets...

635
00:49:54.074 --> 00:49:55.868
Misfire! Misfire!

636
00:49:58.245 --> 00:50:00.247
God damn it! Mac!

637
00:50:01.207 --> 00:50:04.627
Get that thing...
Fuck it, get it in the tree line!

638
00:50:05.586 --> 00:50:06.754
Jesus!

639
00:50:06.879 --> 00:50:09.089
My unit is down hard and hurting!

640
00:50:09.215 --> 00:50:12.760
Six are pulling back to Blue Line,
Leg Lima 6 out.

641
00:50:13.552 --> 00:50:15.554
Pull back! Pull back!

642
00:50:15.596 --> 00:50:17.723
Run! Run, Forrest!

643
00:50:17.806 --> 00:50:20.142
- Pull back!
- Forrest, Forrest!

644
00:50:20.267 --> 00:50:22.895
Run, man! Run!

645
00:50:22.937 --> 00:50:24.730
Pull back! Run!

646
00:50:26.565 --> 00:50:28.776
Run, God damn it, run!

647
00:50:49.964 --> 00:50:54.593
Medic! Can I get a medic?

648
00:50:54.969 --> 00:50:58.305
I ran and ran, just like Jenny told me to.

649
00:51:01.684 --> 00:51:05.938
I ran so far and so fast
that pretty soon I was all by myself,

650
00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:07.940
which was a bad thing.

651
00:51:08.482 --> 00:51:10.025
Bubba!

652
00:51:12.152 --> 00:51:15.948
Bubba was my best good friend.
I had to make sure that he was okay.

653
00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:21.704
Any friendlies out there?

654
00:51:22.663 --> 00:51:24.832
Yeah, I've got three over here.

655
00:51:25.457 --> 00:51:27.459
Where the hell are you?

656
00:51:28.043 --> 00:51:29.378
Bubba?

657
00:51:30.462 --> 00:51:33.173
And on my way back to find Bubba,

658
00:51:33.299 --> 00:51:36.135
well, there was this boy
laying on the ground.

659
00:51:36.176 --> 00:51:37.386
Tex!

660
00:51:39.471 --> 00:51:40.514
Okay.

661
00:51:40.556 --> 00:51:44.518
I couldn't just let him lay there
all alone, scared the way he was,

662
00:51:44.643 --> 00:51:48.522
so I grabbed him up
and run him out of there.

663
00:52:03.662 --> 00:52:06.081
And every time I went back
looking for Bubba,

664
00:52:06.206 --> 00:52:09.710
somebody else was saying,
"Help me, Forrest. Help me."

665
00:52:17.384 --> 00:52:19.261
Can't hear... Can't hear...

666
00:52:21.555 --> 00:52:22.890
No sweat, man. Just lay back.

667
00:52:22.931 --> 00:52:25.434
You'll be okay. You'll be okay.

668
00:52:27.436 --> 00:52:30.522
I started to get scared
that I might never find Bubba.

669
00:52:30.564 --> 00:52:31.857
Over.

670
00:52:31.899 --> 00:52:35.235
Roger, Strongarm,
I know my position is danger close.

671
00:52:35.277 --> 00:52:37.112
We got Charlie all over this area.

672
00:52:37.237 --> 00:52:39.573
I gotta have those fast movers
in here now. Over.

673
00:52:39.615 --> 00:52:43.035
- Six, Strongarm, we want...
- Lieutenant Dan, Coleman's dead!

674
00:52:43.077 --> 00:52:44.286
I know he's dead!

675
00:52:44.411 --> 00:52:47.247
My whole goddamn platoon
is wiped out!

676
00:52:47.373 --> 00:52:48.767
- Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6.
- God damn it!

677
00:52:48.791 --> 00:52:51.543
- Copy this transmission. Over.
- What are you doing?

678
00:52:51.585 --> 00:52:54.922
Just leave me here! Get away.
Just leave me here! Get out!

679
00:52:55.047 --> 00:52:57.383
Leg Lima 6, Strongarm.
How copy this? Over.

680
00:52:57.424 --> 00:53:00.094
God, I said leave me here, God damn it!

681
00:53:00.135 --> 00:53:03.305
Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6,
this is Strongarm, be advised

682
00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:05.432
your fast movers
are inbound at this time, over.

683
00:53:05.474 --> 00:53:08.894
Then, it felt like something
just jumped up and bit me.

684
00:53:09.770 --> 00:53:11.438
Something bit me!

685
00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:20.447
You chink son of a bitch!

686
00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:24.952
I can't leave the platoon.

687
00:53:25.077 --> 00:53:29.998
I told you to leave me there, Gump.
Forget about me. Get yourself out!

688
00:53:30.124 --> 00:53:32.251
Did you hear what I said?

689
00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:34.920
God damn it, put me down!

690
00:53:35.629 --> 00:53:37.673
Get your ass out of here!

691
00:53:40.968 --> 00:53:43.595
I didn't ask you to pull me out of there,
God damn you!

692
00:53:43.637 --> 00:53:45.073
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

693
00:53:45.097 --> 00:53:46.181
To get Bubba.

694
00:53:46.306 --> 00:53:50.144
I got an air strike inbound right now.
They're gonna nape the whole area.

695
00:53:50.269 --> 00:53:52.646
Gump, you stay here, God damn it!
That's an order!

696
00:53:52.771 --> 00:53:55.190
I gotta find Bubba!

697
00:54:11.165 --> 00:54:12.624
Forrest.

698
00:54:20.382 --> 00:54:23.051
- Bubba.
- I'm okay, Forrest.

699
00:54:23.844 --> 00:54:25.512
I'm okay.

700
00:54:33.353 --> 00:54:35.189
Oh, Bubba, no...

701
00:54:35.314 --> 00:54:37.524
Nah, I'm gonna be all right.

702
00:54:45.699 --> 00:54:48.368
Come on. Come on. Come on.

703
00:54:53.373 --> 00:54:54.875
I'm okay, Forrest.

704
00:54:56.210 --> 00:54:59.046
I'm okay, man. I'm fine.

705
00:55:36.083 --> 00:55:39.211
Helo's inbound.
Top smoke, get it out there!

706
00:55:40.254 --> 00:55:44.758
If I'd a known this was gonna be the
last time me and Bubba was gonna talk,

707
00:55:44.883 --> 00:55:47.219
I'd of thought of something better to say.

708
00:55:47.261 --> 00:55:48.762
Hey, Bubba.

709
00:55:49.888 --> 00:55:51.265
Hey, Forrest.

710
00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:56.812
Forrest, why'd this happen?

711
00:55:58.146 --> 00:55:59.940
You got shot.

712
00:56:01.650 --> 00:56:05.821
Then Bubba said something
I won't ever forget.

713
00:56:06.613 --> 00:56:08.282
I wanna go home.

714
00:56:10.284 --> 00:56:12.327
Bubba was my best good friend.

715
00:56:13.287 --> 00:56:17.833
And even I know that ain't something
you can find just around the corner.

716
00:56:17.958 --> 00:56:21.086
Bubba was gonna be
a shrimping boat captain,

717
00:56:21.128 --> 00:56:25.090
but instead he died right there
by that river in Vietnam.

718
00:56:30.804 --> 00:56:33.098
That's all I have to say about that.

719
00:56:35.475 --> 00:56:37.644
It was a bullet, wasn't it?

720
00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:42.649
- A bullet?
- That jumped up and bit you.

721
00:56:45.027 --> 00:56:47.154
Oh, yes, sir.

722
00:56:47.195 --> 00:56:50.324
Bit me directly in the buttocks.

723
00:56:50.449 --> 00:56:55.704
They said it was a million-dollar wound,
but the Army must keep that money,

724
00:56:55.829 --> 00:56:59.666
'cause I still ain't seen a nickel
of that million dollars.

725
00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:04.004
The only good thing
about being wounded in the buttocks

726
00:57:04.129 --> 00:57:05.839
is the ice cream.

727
00:57:05.964 --> 00:57:08.550
They gave me all the ice cream
I could eat.

728
00:57:08.675 --> 00:57:10.010
And guess what?

729
00:57:10.052 --> 00:57:13.180
A good friend of mine
was in the bed right next door.

730
00:57:15.390 --> 00:57:18.477
Lieutenant Dan,
I got you some ice cream.

731
00:57:20.854 --> 00:57:23.023
Lieutenant Dan, ice cream.

732
00:57:34.743 --> 00:57:37.037
It's time for your bath, Lieutenant.

733
00:57:45.545 --> 00:57:46.880
Harper!

734
00:57:50.092 --> 00:57:52.552
Cooper, Larson,

735
00:57:54.763 --> 00:57:56.098
Webster,

736
00:57:57.516 --> 00:58:01.019
- Gump. Gump.
- I'm Forrest Gump.

737
00:58:04.564 --> 00:58:07.859
Kyle, Nichols,

738
00:58:10.070 --> 00:58:16.034
McMill, Johnson, Tyler,

739
00:58:17.369 --> 00:58:18.745
Holiday...

740
00:58:25.502 --> 00:58:27.754
Surprise, surprise, surprise!

741
00:58:31.091 --> 00:58:33.593
Gump, how can you watch
that stupid shit?

742
00:58:33.677 --> 00:58:35.321
- From the DMZ to the Delta...
- Turn it off!

743
00:58:35.345 --> 00:58:38.598
You are tuned to the
American Forces Vietnam Network.

744
00:58:38.724 --> 00:58:41.059
This is Channel 6, Saigon.

745
00:58:43.770 --> 00:58:45.439
Good catch, Gump.

746
00:58:47.399 --> 00:58:49.568
You know how to play this?

747
00:58:50.861 --> 00:58:52.946
Come on, let me show you. Here.

748
00:58:55.032 --> 00:58:57.367
Now, the secret to this game is,

749
00:58:57.451 --> 00:59:03.290
no matter what happens,
never ever take your eye off the ball.

750
00:59:06.877 --> 00:59:08.211
All right.

751
00:59:11.548 --> 00:59:15.218
For some reason,
Ping-Pong came very natural to me.

752
00:59:15.552 --> 00:59:18.472
See? Any idiot can play.

753
00:59:18.972 --> 00:59:21.725
So, I started playing it all the time.

754
00:59:22.893 --> 00:59:24.269
I played Ping-Pong

755
00:59:24.311 --> 00:59:27.606
even when I didn't have anyone
to play Ping-Pong with.

756
00:59:35.655 --> 00:59:40.327
The hospital's people said
it made me look like a duck in water,

757
00:59:40.452 --> 00:59:42.287
whatever that means.

758
00:59:42.746 --> 00:59:45.999
Even Lieutenant Dan would come
and watch me play.

759
00:59:51.505 --> 00:59:55.383
I played Ping-Pong so much,
I even played it in my sleep.

760
01:00:03.183 --> 01:00:08.313
Now, you listen to me.
We all have a destiny.

761
01:00:08.355 --> 01:00:11.399
Nothing just happens,
it's all part of a plan.

762
01:00:11.525 --> 01:00:14.194
I should have died out there
with my men,

763
01:00:14.319 --> 01:00:18.323
but now I'm nothing
but a goddamn cripple,

764
01:00:18.365 --> 01:00:21.993
a legless freak! Look! Look! Look at me!

765
01:00:22.744 --> 01:00:23.870
Do you see that?

766
01:00:23.912 --> 01:00:27.707
Do you know what it's like
not to be able to use your legs?

767
01:00:31.044 --> 01:00:32.671
Yes, sir, I do.

768
01:00:36.341 --> 01:00:38.385
Did you hear what I said?

769
01:00:39.261 --> 01:00:41.054
You cheated me.

770
01:00:41.096 --> 01:00:42.264
I had a destiny.

771
01:00:42.347 --> 01:00:45.892
I was supposed to die in the field,
with honor!

772
01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:50.605
That was my destiny,
and you cheated me out of it!

773
01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:02.951
Do you understand
what I'm saying, Gump?

774
01:01:05.078 --> 01:01:08.456
This wasn't supposed to happen,
not to me.

775
01:01:11.084 --> 01:01:12.752
I had a destiny.

776
01:01:14.713 --> 01:01:19.092
I was Lieutenant Dan Taylor.

777
01:01:25.265 --> 01:01:27.601
You're still Lieutenant Dan.

778
01:01:50.832 --> 01:01:52.334
Look at me.

779
01:01:53.668 --> 01:01:55.629
What am I gonna do now?

780
01:01:59.299 --> 01:02:01.343
What am I gonna do now?

781
01:02:11.728 --> 01:02:13.188
PFC Gump?

782
01:02:14.731 --> 01:02:16.149
Yes, sir!

783
01:02:16.816 --> 01:02:18.318
As you were.

784
01:02:18.818 --> 01:02:22.656
Son, you've been awarded
the Medal of Honor.

785
01:02:23.698 --> 01:02:27.327
Guess what, Lieutenant Dan,
they want to give me a...

786
01:02:34.084 --> 01:02:37.837
Ma'am, what'd they do
with Lieutenant Dan?

787
01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:40.548
They sent him home.

788
01:02:46.554 --> 01:02:49.307
Two weeks later, I left Vietnam.

789
01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:53.895
The ceremony was kicked off
with a candid speech by the President

790
01:02:53.979 --> 01:02:57.357
regarding the need for further escalation
of the war in Vietnam.

791
01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:59.567
President Johnson awarded
four Medals of Honor

792
01:02:59.651 --> 01:03:01.319
to men
from each of the Armed Services.

793
01:03:01.403 --> 01:03:04.322
America owes you
a debt of gratitude, son.

794
01:03:06.324 --> 01:03:10.120
I understand you were wounded.
Where were you hit?

795
01:03:10.203 --> 01:03:13.373
- In the buttocks, sir.
- That must be a sight.

796
01:03:14.124 --> 01:03:16.418
I'd kind of like to see that.

797
01:03:30.557 --> 01:03:32.017
God damn, son.

798
01:03:34.144 --> 01:03:37.981
After that,
Mama went to the hotel to lay down,

799
01:03:38.064 --> 01:03:41.568
so I went out for a walk
to see our nation's capital.

800
01:03:41.651 --> 01:03:44.779
Hilary, all right, I've got the vets,
what do you want me to do with them?

801
01:03:44.863 --> 01:03:46.614
What are you doing here so late?

802
01:03:46.698 --> 01:03:50.744
It's a good thing Mama was resting,
'cause the streets was awful crowded

803
01:03:50.827 --> 01:03:53.997
with people looking
at all the statues and monuments,

804
01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:56.708
and some of them people were loud
and pushy.

805
01:03:56.791 --> 01:03:59.753
Okay, follow me! Come on.
Let's move it out.

806
01:04:00.587 --> 01:04:03.548
Everywhere I went,
I had to stand in line.

807
01:04:06.801 --> 01:04:08.345
Follow me, let's go!

808
01:04:10.138 --> 01:04:11.765
Come on. Let's go.

809
01:04:17.812 --> 01:04:19.397
Stand here.

810
01:04:21.858 --> 01:04:25.028
Hey, you're a good man
for doing this. Good!

811
01:04:26.321 --> 01:04:27.447
Okay.

812
01:04:28.239 --> 01:04:31.618
There was this man giving a little talk.

813
01:04:31.701 --> 01:04:35.205
And for some reason, he was
wearing an American flag for a shirt.

814
01:04:35.288 --> 01:04:36.807
Now, I'm gonna
bring up some soldiers...

815
01:04:36.831 --> 01:04:39.626
And he liked to say the "F" word.

816
01:04:39.709 --> 01:04:43.088
A lot. "F" this and "F" that.

817
01:04:43.171 --> 01:04:45.507
And every time he said the "F" word,

818
01:04:45.590 --> 01:04:48.343
people, for some reason,
well, they'd cheer.

819
01:04:48.426 --> 01:04:51.513
Where to stick this fucking war! Yeah!

820
01:04:52.555 --> 01:04:54.891
Yeah! Yeah!

821
01:04:55.475 --> 01:04:57.977
Come on, man, come up here, man.

822
01:04:58.395 --> 01:05:01.731
Come on. Come on. Yeah, you!
Come on. Move, move, move.

823
01:05:02.732 --> 01:05:06.152
You can do it. Just get up there.
Go on. That's it.

824
01:05:18.957 --> 01:05:21.501
Tell us a little bit about the war, man.

825
01:05:21.584 --> 01:05:23.336
The war in Vietnam?

826
01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:26.339
- The war in Viet-fucking-nam!
- Yeah!

827
01:05:46.693 --> 01:05:47.777
Peace!

828
01:05:48.153 --> 01:05:49.529
Come on, man, go!

829
01:05:49.821 --> 01:05:51.781
- Come on!
- Peace!

830
01:05:51.865 --> 01:05:52.907
Well...

831
01:05:52.991 --> 01:05:56.494
There was only one thing
I could say about the war in Vietnam.

832
01:05:56.536 --> 01:06:01.374
There's only one thing
I can say about the war in Vietnam.

833
01:06:05.170 --> 01:06:08.965
In Vietnam, your...

834
01:06:18.725 --> 01:06:19.869
Hey, what the hell are you...

835
01:06:19.893 --> 01:06:22.687
I'll beat your head in,
you goddamn oinker!

836
01:06:22.729 --> 01:06:25.231
Jesus Christ, what'd they do with this?

837
01:06:26.649 --> 01:06:28.318
We can't hear you!

838
01:06:30.028 --> 01:06:32.030
We can't hear anything!

839
01:06:32.739 --> 01:06:35.241
- This one! This one! Give me that!
- Turn it up!

840
01:06:35.325 --> 01:06:36.743
Speak up!

841
01:06:37.535 --> 01:06:38.995
That's it!

842
01:06:40.079 --> 01:06:42.916
And that's all I have to say about that.

843
01:06:50.215 --> 01:06:53.176
That's so right on, man. You said it all.

844
01:06:54.677 --> 01:06:57.222
What's your name, man?

845
01:06:57.263 --> 01:06:59.891
My name is Forrest. Forrest Gump.

846
01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:02.268
Forrest Gump!

847
01:07:02.393 --> 01:07:03.770
- Gump!
- Gump!

848
01:07:05.271 --> 01:07:09.025
Forrest! Forrest!

849
01:07:13.071 --> 01:07:15.448
- Jenny!
- Forrest!

850
01:07:32.215 --> 01:07:34.884
Hey! Hey!

851
01:07:42.976 --> 01:07:46.104
It was the happiest moment of my life.

852
01:07:48.439 --> 01:07:51.818
Jenny and me were just like
peas and carrots again.

853
01:07:53.152 --> 01:07:54.737
She showed me around,

854
01:07:54.821 --> 01:07:57.407
and even introduced me
to some of her new friends.

855
01:07:57.490 --> 01:07:58.825
Shut that blind, man.

856
01:07:58.950 --> 01:08:01.160
And get your white ass
away from that window.

857
01:08:01.244 --> 01:08:03.329
Don't you know we in a war here?

858
01:08:04.163 --> 01:08:05.641
Hey, man, he's cool. He's cool.
He's one of us.

859
01:08:05.665 --> 01:08:07.643
- Let me tell you about us.
- Where the hell have you been?

860
01:08:07.667 --> 01:08:09.794
Our purpose here
is to protect our black leaders

861
01:08:09.836 --> 01:08:11.629
from the racial onslaught of the pig

862
01:08:11.671 --> 01:08:13.798
who wishes to brutalize
our black leaders,

863
01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:17.176
rape our women,
and destroy our black communities.

864
01:08:20.096 --> 01:08:22.015
Who's the baby killer?

865
01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:24.851
This is my good friend I told you about.
This is Forrest Gump.

866
01:08:24.934 --> 01:08:26.686
Forrest, this is Wesley.

867
01:08:26.769 --> 01:08:28.122
Wesley and I lived together in Berkeley,

868
01:08:28.146 --> 01:08:30.773
and he's the president
of the Berkeley chapter of SDS.

869
01:08:30.857 --> 01:08:32.317
Let me tell you something else.

870
01:08:32.358 --> 01:08:36.654
We are here to offer protection and help
for all of those who need our help,

871
01:08:36.696 --> 01:08:40.283
because we, the Black Panthers,
are against the war in Vietnam.

872
01:08:40.366 --> 01:08:44.037
Yes, we are against any war where
black soldiers are sent to the frontline

873
01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:46.039
to die for a country that hates them.

874
01:08:46.122 --> 01:08:49.292
Yes, we are against any war
where black soldiers go to fight

875
01:08:49.375 --> 01:08:52.503
and come to be brutalized and killed
in their own communities

876
01:08:52.545 --> 01:08:54.172
as they sleep in their beds at night.

877
01:08:54.213 --> 01:08:55.381
You are a fucking asshole!

878
01:08:55.465 --> 01:08:58.843
Yes, we are against all these racist
and imperial dog acts.

879
01:09:08.144 --> 01:09:11.356
Forrest! Quit it! Quit it!

880
01:09:13.316 --> 01:09:14.567
Forrest!

881
01:09:15.151 --> 01:09:16.903
Stop it! Stop it!

882
01:09:23.534 --> 01:09:24.911
Oh, God...

883
01:09:25.745 --> 01:09:28.164
I shouldn't have brought you here.

884
01:09:28.247 --> 01:09:31.876
I should have known it was just
gonna be some bullshit hassle.

885
01:09:33.044 --> 01:09:35.672
He should not be hitting you, Jenny.

886
01:09:40.593 --> 01:09:42.345
Come on, Forrest.

887
01:09:48.059 --> 01:09:52.063
Sorry I had a fight in the middle
of your Black Panther party.

888
01:09:54.941 --> 01:09:57.336
He doesn't mean it when
he does things like this. He doesn't.

889
01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:59.696
I would never hurt you, Jenny.

890
01:10:01.531 --> 01:10:03.783
I know you wouldn't, Forrest.

891
01:10:05.702 --> 01:10:08.287
I wanted to be your boyfriend.

892
01:10:18.798 --> 01:10:21.217
That uniform is a trip, Forrest.

893
01:10:22.593 --> 01:10:25.805
You look handsome in it. You do.

894
01:10:29.892 --> 01:10:31.811
- You know what?
- What?

895
01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:39.068
I'm glad we were here together
in our nation's capital.

896
01:10:40.653 --> 01:10:42.447
Me, too, Forrest.

897
01:10:42.488 --> 01:10:47.160
We walked around all night,
Jenny and me, just talking.

898
01:10:49.245 --> 01:10:52.415
She told me about
all the traveling she'd done.

899
01:10:52.498 --> 01:10:57.128
And how she'd discovered ways
to expand her mind

900
01:10:57.170 --> 01:11:00.256
and learn how to live in harmony,

901
01:11:00.339 --> 01:11:02.675
which must be out west somewhere,

902
01:11:02.759 --> 01:11:05.094
'cause she made it
all the way to California.

903
01:11:05.178 --> 01:11:07.430
Try to love one another right now

904
01:11:07.513 --> 01:11:08.681
Hey!

905
01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:12.185
Anybody want to go to San Francisco?

906
01:11:12.268 --> 01:11:14.145
- I'll go.
- Far out.

907
01:11:15.605 --> 01:11:18.775
It was a very special night
for the two of us.

908
01:11:20.359 --> 01:11:22.445
I didn't want it to end.

909
01:11:23.154 --> 01:11:25.656
I wish you wouldn't go, Jenny.

910
01:11:26.657 --> 01:11:28.451
I have to, Forrest.

911
01:11:29.452 --> 01:11:30.703
Jenny?

912
01:11:32.872 --> 01:11:35.500
Things got a little out of hand.

913
01:11:35.541 --> 01:11:39.378
It's just this war
and that lying son of a bitch, Johnson!

914
01:11:41.047 --> 01:11:43.841
I would never hurt you, you know that.

915
01:11:46.969 --> 01:11:48.971
You know what I think?

916
01:11:50.473 --> 01:11:55.728
I think you should go home
to Greenbow, Alabama!

917
01:12:06.239 --> 01:12:11.327
Forrest, we have very different lives,
you know.

918
01:12:20.753 --> 01:12:23.923
I want you to have this.

919
01:12:28.594 --> 01:12:30.763
Forrest, I can't keep this.

920
01:12:32.431 --> 01:12:36.686
I got it just by doing
what you told me to do.

921
01:12:38.729 --> 01:12:40.898
Why are you so good to me?

922
01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:43.943
You're my girl.

923
01:12:45.945 --> 01:12:48.072
I'll always be your girl.

924
01:13:28.487 --> 01:13:33.326
And just like that, she was gone,
out of my life again.

925
01:13:34.827 --> 01:13:37.163
That's one small step for man,

926
01:13:39.165 --> 01:13:42.001
one giant leap for mankind.

927
01:13:47.673 --> 01:13:50.176
I thought I was going back to Vietnam,

928
01:13:50.301 --> 01:13:53.512
but instead, they decided the best way
for me to fight the Communists

929
01:13:53.596 --> 01:13:55.222
was to play Ping-Pong.

930
01:13:55.306 --> 01:13:57.600
So, I was in the Special Services,

931
01:13:57.683 --> 01:14:00.937
traveling around the country
cheering up all them wounded veterans

932
01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:03.439
and showing them
how to play Ping-Pong.

933
01:14:03.522 --> 01:14:05.441
I was so good that some years later

934
01:14:05.524 --> 01:14:09.153
the Army decided that I should be
on the All-American Ping-Pong team.

935
01:14:09.779 --> 01:14:12.198
We were the first Americans
to visit the land of China

936
01:14:12.281 --> 01:14:14.700
in like a million years,
or something like that.

937
01:14:14.825 --> 01:14:18.245
Somebody said world peace
was in our hands,

938
01:14:18.329 --> 01:14:21.165
but all I did was play Ping-Pong.

939
01:14:21.207 --> 01:14:24.293
When I got home,
I was a national celebrity.

940
01:14:25.002 --> 01:14:27.296
Famouser even than Captain Kangaroo.

941
01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:30.049
Here he is, Forrest Gump, right here.

942
01:14:36.806 --> 01:14:38.557
Mr. Gump, have a seat.

943
01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:43.229
Forrest Gump, John Lennon.

944
01:14:43.896 --> 01:14:45.207
- Welcome home.
- You had quite a trip.

945
01:14:45.231 --> 01:14:48.567
Can you tell us, what was China like?

946
01:14:51.821 --> 01:14:57.076
In the land of China,
people hardly got nothing at all.

947
01:14:57.159 --> 01:14:58.744
No possessions?

948
01:15:01.372 --> 01:15:04.583
And in China, they never go to church.

949
01:15:05.876 --> 01:15:07.586
No religion, too?

950
01:15:09.505 --> 01:15:12.800
- Hard to imagine.
- Well, it's easy if you try, Dick.

951
01:15:14.593 --> 01:15:16.971
Some years later,
that nice young man from England

952
01:15:17.054 --> 01:15:19.724
was on his way home
to see his little boy

953
01:15:19.765 --> 01:15:22.768
and was signing some autographs,

954
01:15:22.893 --> 01:15:26.856
and for no particular reason at all,
somebody shot him.

955
01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:33.738
They gave you
the Congressional Medal of Honor.

956
01:15:35.031 --> 01:15:37.116
Now, that's Lieutenant Dan.

957
01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:41.537
Lieutenant Dan!

958
01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:46.083
They gave you
the Congressional Medal of Honor!

959
01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:49.462
Yes, sir, they surely did.

960
01:15:49.545 --> 01:15:51.547
They gave you,

961
01:15:51.630 --> 01:15:55.801
an imbecile,
a moron who goes on television

962
01:15:55.885 --> 01:16:00.139
and makes a fool out of himself
in front of the whole damn country,

963
01:16:00.806 --> 01:16:03.309
the Congressional Medal of Honor.

964
01:16:04.477 --> 01:16:05.644
Yes, sir.

965
01:16:07.813 --> 01:16:10.649
Well, then, that's just perfect!

966
01:16:12.568 --> 01:16:14.904
Yeah, well,
I just got one thing to say to that.

967
01:16:14.987 --> 01:16:17.239
God damn bless America.

968
01:16:18.157 --> 01:16:19.450
Hey!

969
01:16:21.243 --> 01:16:22.578
Oh, God!

970
01:16:25.081 --> 01:16:27.500
- Oh, God!
- Lieutenant Dan!

971
01:16:28.626 --> 01:16:31.378
Lieutenant Dan said
he was living in a hotel.

972
01:16:31.462 --> 01:16:33.422
And because he didn't have no legs,

973
01:16:33.506 --> 01:16:36.675
he spent most of his time
exercising his arms.

974
01:16:39.553 --> 01:16:42.014
Take a right. Take a right.

975
01:16:44.642 --> 01:16:47.186
Hey! Come on, already!

976
01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:50.064
What do you do here in New York,
Lieutenant Dan?

977
01:16:50.147 --> 01:16:52.691
I'm living off the government tit.

978
01:16:54.318 --> 01:16:55.694
Sucking it dry!

979
01:16:55.778 --> 01:16:57.822
Hey! Hey! Hey! Are you blind?

980
01:16:57.905 --> 01:16:59.615
- I'm walking here!
- Get out of the way!

981
01:16:59.698 --> 01:17:02.284
Get out! Come on, go! Go! Go!

982
01:17:09.333 --> 01:17:13.087
I stayed with Lieutenant Dan
and celebrated the holidays.

983
01:17:17.508 --> 01:17:20.928
You have a great year.
Hurry home and God bless you.

984
01:17:23.931 --> 01:17:26.725
Have you found Jesus yet, Gump?

985
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:31.981
I didn't know I was supposed to be
looking for him, sir.

986
01:17:38.571 --> 01:17:41.949
That's all these cripples,
down at the VA,

987
01:17:42.032 --> 01:17:44.451
that's all they ever talk about.

988
01:17:45.619 --> 01:17:48.581
Jesus this and Jesus that.

989
01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:52.334
Have I found Jesus?

990
01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:55.963
They even had a priest come
and talk to me.

991
01:17:56.839 --> 01:18:01.510
He said God is listening,
but I have to help myself.

992
01:18:02.887 --> 01:18:05.181
How if I accept Jesus into my heart,

993
01:18:06.182 --> 01:18:09.977
I'll get to walk beside him
in the kingdom of heaven.

994
01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:12.229
Did you hear what I said?

995
01:18:13.272 --> 01:18:17.276
Walk beside him
in the kingdom of heaven.

996
01:18:17.359 --> 01:18:20.321
Well, kiss my crippled ass.

997
01:18:20.404 --> 01:18:23.782
God is listening? What a crock of shit.

998
01:18:27.453 --> 01:18:30.080
I'm going to heaven, Lieutenant Dan.

999
01:18:31.999 --> 01:18:33.042
Oh?

1000
01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:39.256
Well,

1001
01:18:42.218 --> 01:18:45.596
before you go, why don't you get
your ass down to the corner

1002
01:18:45.679 --> 01:18:48.182
- and get us another bottle of Ripple.
- Yes, sir.

1003
01:18:48.265 --> 01:18:53.395
We are at approximately 45th Street
in New York City at One Astor Plaza.

1004
01:18:53.479 --> 01:18:55.314
This is the site of the old Astor Hotel.

1005
01:18:55.397 --> 01:18:57.608
What the hell is in Bayou La Batre?

1006
01:18:57.691 --> 01:19:00.027
- Shrimping boats.
- Shrimping boats?

1007
01:19:00.110 --> 01:19:02.529
Who gives a shit
about shrimping boats?

1008
01:19:02.613 --> 01:19:04.132
I gotta buy me
one of them shrimping boats,

1009
01:19:04.156 --> 01:19:05.699
soon as I have some money.

1010
01:19:05.783 --> 01:19:08.619
I made me a promise to Bubba
in Vietnam

1011
01:19:08.702 --> 01:19:11.413
that as soon as the war was over,
we'd go in partners.

1012
01:19:11.497 --> 01:19:14.917
He'd be the captain of the
shrimping boat and I'd be his first mate.

1013
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:18.462
But now that he's dead,
that means I gotta be the captain.

1014
01:19:18.545 --> 01:19:21.257
- A shrimp boat captain.
- Yes, sir.

1015
01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:24.093
A promise is a promise, Lieutenant Dan.

1016
01:19:25.594 --> 01:19:28.055
Now hear this!

1017
01:19:28.806 --> 01:19:32.643
Private Gump here
is gonna be a shrimp boat captain.

1018
01:19:33.394 --> 01:19:34.812
Well, I tell you what, Gilligan,

1019
01:19:34.895 --> 01:19:37.356
the day that you are
a shrimp boat captain,

1020
01:19:37.439 --> 01:19:40.985
- I will come and be your first mate.
- Okay.

1021
01:19:41.068 --> 01:19:45.406
If you're ever a shrimp boat captain,
that's the day I'm an astronaut.

1022
01:19:45.489 --> 01:19:48.492
Danny, what are
you complaining about?

1023
01:19:48.575 --> 01:19:51.161
- What are you doing, hon?
- Mr. Hot Wheels.

1024
01:19:51.245 --> 01:19:54.873
- Who's your friend?
- My name is Forrest, Forrest Gump.

1025
01:19:55.708 --> 01:19:59.920
This is Cunning Carla
and Long-Limbs Lenore.

1026
01:20:01.005 --> 01:20:04.216
So, where you been, baby cakes, huh?
Haven't seen you around lately.

1027
01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:05.819
You know, you should have
been here for Christmas,

1028
01:20:05.843 --> 01:20:07.237
'cause Tommy bought a round
on the house

1029
01:20:07.261 --> 01:20:08.762
and gave everybody a turkey sandwich.

1030
01:20:08.846 --> 01:20:11.890
Well, well, I had company.

1031
01:20:12.766 --> 01:20:16.437
Hey, hey! We was just there.
That's at Times Square.

1032
01:20:17.062 --> 01:20:21.191
Don't you just love New Year's?
You get to start all over.

1033
01:20:21.275 --> 01:20:24.570
- Hey, Lenore...
- Everybody gets a second chance.

1034
01:20:24.653 --> 01:20:27.197
It's funny,
but in the middle of all that fun,

1035
01:20:27.281 --> 01:20:29.575
I began to think about Jenny,

1036
01:20:30.492 --> 01:20:34.955
wondering how she was spending
her New Year's night out in California.

1037
01:20:57.561 --> 01:21:01.065
Eight, seven, six, five,

1038
01:21:01.190 --> 01:21:04.651
four, three, two, one!

1039
01:21:04.777 --> 01:21:07.446
Happy New Year!

1040
01:21:23.921 --> 01:21:26.632
Happy New Year, Lieutenant Dan!

1041
01:22:01.917 --> 01:22:05.587
What are you, stupid or something?
What's your problem?

1042
01:22:06.255 --> 01:22:07.673
What's his problem?

1043
01:22:07.756 --> 01:22:10.008
Did you lose your pecker in the war
or something?

1044
01:22:10.092 --> 01:22:12.177
What, is your friend stupid
or something?

1045
01:22:12.219 --> 01:22:13.345
What did you say?

1046
01:22:13.387 --> 01:22:14.864
I said, is your friend stupid
or something?

1047
01:22:14.888 --> 01:22:17.057
Hey! Don't call him stupid!

1048
01:22:17.141 --> 01:22:19.101
- Hey, don't you push her!
- You shut up!

1049
01:22:19.184 --> 01:22:21.287
- Don't you ever call him stupid!
- What's the matter, baby?

1050
01:22:21.311 --> 01:22:23.081
- Why are you so upset?
- Just get the hell out of here.

1051
01:22:23.105 --> 01:22:24.249
- Stupid damn...
- Get your goddamn clothes...

1052
01:22:24.273 --> 01:22:25.834
You belong in Ripley's Believe It Or Not!

1053
01:22:25.858 --> 01:22:27.794
- Get the hell out of here!
- You should be in a sideshow!

1054
01:22:27.818 --> 01:22:28.861
Go on! Get out of here!

1055
01:22:28.944 --> 01:22:30.296
Come on, Lenore.
We don't need this shit!

1056
01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:31.697
Get out of here!

1057
01:22:33.323 --> 01:22:35.868
- You retard.
- Loser. You freak.

1058
01:22:41.248 --> 01:22:42.458
No, no.

1059
01:23:07.608 --> 01:23:11.570
I'm sorry I ruined your
New Year's Eve party, Lieutenant Dan.

1060
01:23:12.154 --> 01:23:14.448
She tasted like cigarettes.

1061
01:23:30.631 --> 01:23:35.135
I guess Lieutenant Dan figured there's
some things you just can't change.

1062
01:23:35.219 --> 01:23:40.349
He didn't want to be called crippled, just
like I didn't want to be called stupid.

1063
01:23:45.854 --> 01:23:47.731
Happy New Year, Gump.

1064
01:23:52.528 --> 01:23:53.946
The US Ping-Pong team

1065
01:23:53.987 --> 01:23:56.341
met with President Nixon today
at an Oval Office ceremony...

1066
01:23:56.365 --> 01:23:59.117
And wouldn't you know it?
A few months later,

1067
01:23:59.201 --> 01:24:03.163
they invited me and the Ping-Pong team
to visit the White House.

1068
01:24:03.247 --> 01:24:05.499
So, I went, again.

1069
01:24:06.333 --> 01:24:09.795
And I met the President
of the United States, again.

1070
01:24:10.546 --> 01:24:13.507
Only, this time, they didn't get us rooms
in a real fancy hotel.

1071
01:24:13.590 --> 01:24:16.969
So, are you enjoying yourself
in our nation's capital, young man?

1072
01:24:17.052 --> 01:24:20.055
- Yes, sir.
- Well, where are you staying?

1073
01:24:20.138 --> 01:24:22.766
- It's called the Hotel Ebbott.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

1074
01:24:22.849 --> 01:24:25.978
I know of a much nicer hotel.
It's brand-new, very modern.

1075
01:24:26.061 --> 01:24:28.063
I'll have my people
take care of it for you.

1076
01:24:28.689 --> 01:24:29.815
Security, Frank Wills.

1077
01:24:29.898 --> 01:24:33.485
Yeah, sir, you might want
to send a maintenance man

1078
01:24:33.569 --> 01:24:36.280
over to that office across the way.

1079
01:24:36.321 --> 01:24:39.201
The lights are off, and they must be
looking for a fuse box or something,

1080
01:24:39.283 --> 01:24:41.994
'cause them flashlights,
they're keeping me awake.

1081
01:24:42.077 --> 01:24:43.704
Okay, sir. I'll check it out.

1082
01:24:43.787 --> 01:24:45.497
- Thank you.
- No problem.

1083
01:24:45.581 --> 01:24:47.499
- Good night.
- Good night.

1084
01:24:51.128 --> 01:24:56.508
Therefore, I shall resign the presidency
effective at noon tomorrow.

1085
01:24:56.592 --> 01:24:58.635
Vice President Ford

1086
01:24:58.719 --> 01:25:03.223
will be sworn in as president
at that hour in this office.

1087
01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:09.396
As I recall the high hopes for America
with which we began this second term...

1088
01:25:14.651 --> 01:25:16.194
Sergeant Gump.

1089
01:25:16.695 --> 01:25:18.905
- Yes, sir!
- As you were.

1090
01:25:18.989 --> 01:25:22.117
I have your discharge papers.
Your service is up, son.

1091
01:25:25.537 --> 01:25:28.290
Does this mean
I can't play Ping-Pong no more?

1092
01:25:28.373 --> 01:25:30.334
For the Army it does.

1093
01:25:32.961 --> 01:25:37.841
And just like that, my service
in the United States Army was over.

1094
01:25:43.138 --> 01:25:44.931
So, I went home.

1095
01:26:06.411 --> 01:26:09.831
- I'm home, Mama.
- I know, I know.

1096
01:26:11.458 --> 01:26:13.061
- Louise, he's here.
- Now, when I got home,

1097
01:26:13.085 --> 01:26:17.130
I had no idea,
but Mama had had all sorts of visitors.

1098
01:26:17.255 --> 01:26:19.591
We've had all sorts of visitors, Forrest.

1099
01:26:19.633 --> 01:26:22.761
Everybody wants you
to use their Ping-Pong stuff.

1100
01:26:22.803 --> 01:26:26.598
One man even left a check for $25,000

1101
01:26:26.682 --> 01:26:30.143
if you'd be agreeable to saying
you liked using their paddle.

1102
01:26:30.268 --> 01:26:32.938
Oh, but, Mama,
I only like using my own paddle.

1103
01:26:33.021 --> 01:26:35.023
- Hi, Miss Louise.
- Hey, Forrest.

1104
01:26:35.107 --> 01:26:38.026
I know that. I know that.

1105
01:26:38.110 --> 01:26:40.779
But it's $25,000, Forrest.

1106
01:26:40.862 --> 01:26:45.575
I thought maybe you could hold it
for a while, see if it grows on you.

1107
01:26:45.617 --> 01:26:47.804
- Oh, you look good, Forrest.
- That Mama, she sure was right.

1108
01:26:47.828 --> 01:26:50.330
- You look real good.
- It's funny how things work out.

1109
01:26:50.455 --> 01:26:53.625
I didn't stay home for long,
because I'd made a promise to Bubba,

1110
01:26:53.667 --> 01:26:55.961
and I always try to keep my promise.

1111
01:26:56.002 --> 01:26:57.546
So, I went on down to Bayou La Batre

1112
01:26:57.629 --> 01:27:01.383
to meet Bubba's family
and make their introduction.

1113
01:27:01.466 --> 01:27:05.137
Are you crazy, or just plain stupid?

1114
01:27:05.846 --> 01:27:08.140
Stupid is as stupid does, Mrs. Blue.

1115
01:27:08.181 --> 01:27:09.558
I guess.

1116
01:27:10.559 --> 01:27:14.146
And, of course,
I paid my respect to Bubba himself

1117
01:27:16.148 --> 01:27:18.692
Hey, Bubba, it's me, Forrest Gump.

1118
01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:25.866
I remember everything you said,
and I got it all figured out.

1119
01:27:28.660 --> 01:27:35.459
I'm taking the $24,562
and 47 cents that I got...

1120
01:27:36.543 --> 01:27:40.172
Or, that's left after a new hair cut
and a new suit,

1121
01:27:40.213 --> 01:27:42.174
and I took Mama out
to a real fancy dinner,

1122
01:27:42.257 --> 01:27:45.510
and I bought a bus ticket
and three Dr. Peppers.

1123
01:27:46.052 --> 01:27:47.846
Tell me something.

1124
01:27:48.889 --> 01:27:51.016
Are you stupid or something?

1125
01:27:51.099 --> 01:27:53.185
Stupid is as stupid does, sir.

1126
01:27:53.226 --> 01:27:56.188
Well, that's what's left after me saying,

1127
01:27:57.105 --> 01:27:59.265
"When I was in China
on the All-America Ping-Pong team,

1128
01:27:59.357 --> 01:28:03.195
"I just loved playing Ping-Pong with
my Flex-O-Light Ping-Pong paddle,"

1129
01:28:03.236 --> 01:28:04.547
which everybody knows isn't true,

1130
01:28:04.571 --> 01:28:06.007
but Mama says it's just a little white lie

1131
01:28:06.031 --> 01:28:08.200
so it wouldn't hurt nobody.

1132
01:28:09.618 --> 01:28:15.540
So, anyway, I'm putting all that on gas,
ropes and new nets

1133
01:28:16.291 --> 01:28:18.043
and a brand-new shrimping boat.

1134
01:28:39.731 --> 01:28:42.984
Now, Bubba had told me everything
he knew about shrimping,

1135
01:28:43.068 --> 01:28:45.403
but you know what I found out?

1136
01:28:47.072 --> 01:28:49.407
Shrimping is tough.

1137
01:28:51.618 --> 01:28:53.453
I only caught five.

1138
01:28:53.578 --> 01:28:56.915
A couple more,
you could have yourself a cocktail.

1139
01:29:00.252 --> 01:29:02.063
Hey, you ever think
about naming this old boat?

1140
01:29:02.087 --> 01:29:04.756
It's bad luck
to have a boat without a name.

1141
01:29:07.133 --> 01:29:11.972
I'd never named a boat before,
but there was only one I could think of,

1142
01:29:13.139 --> 01:29:16.351
the most beautiful name
in the wide world.

1143
01:29:37.372 --> 01:29:40.208
Now, I hadn't heard from Jenny
in a long while,

1144
01:29:40.292 --> 01:29:42.836
but I thought about her a lot,

1145
01:29:42.961 --> 01:29:46.423
and I hoped that whatever
she was doing made her happy.

1146
01:31:32.696 --> 01:31:35.240
I thought about Jenny all the time.

1147
01:31:59.889 --> 01:32:01.057
Hey!

1148
01:32:24.914 --> 01:32:29.586
Lieutenant Dan,
what are you doing here?

1149
01:32:29.669 --> 01:32:33.631
Well, thought I'd try out my sea legs.

1150
01:32:33.673 --> 01:32:37.469
But you ain't got no legs,
Lieutenant Dan.

1151
01:32:37.510 --> 01:32:39.804
Yes, I know that.

1152
01:32:40.138 --> 01:32:42.182
You wrote me a letter, you idiot.

1153
01:32:42.307 --> 01:32:46.853
Well, well. Captain Forrest Gump.
I had to see this for myself.

1154
01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:55.361
And I told you if you were ever
a shrimp boat captain

1155
01:32:55.487 --> 01:32:58.114
that I'd be your first mate.
Well, here I am.

1156
01:32:58.156 --> 01:33:01.326
- I am a man of my word.
- Okay.

1157
01:33:01.367 --> 01:33:05.371
Yeah, but don't you be thinking that
I'm going to be calling you "sir."

1158
01:33:05.497 --> 01:33:06.831
No, sir.

1159
01:33:15.715 --> 01:33:18.009
That's my boat.

1160
01:33:20.595 --> 01:33:26.059
I have a feeling if we head due east,
we'll find some shrimp,

1161
01:33:26.184 --> 01:33:27.769
so take a left.

1162
01:33:29.187 --> 01:33:32.107
- Take a left!
- Which way?

1163
01:33:32.190 --> 01:33:34.859
Over there! They're over there!

1164
01:33:35.527 --> 01:33:39.364
- Get on the wheel and take a left!
- Okay.

1165
01:33:40.573 --> 01:33:44.702
Gump, what are you doing?
Take a left! Left!

1166
01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:50.708
That's where we're going
to find those shrimp, my boy!

1167
01:33:52.293 --> 01:33:53.878
That's where we'll find them.

1168
01:34:06.558 --> 01:34:10.687
- Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan.
- Okay, so I was wrong.

1169
01:34:11.396 --> 01:34:14.607
How are we going to find them?

1170
01:34:14.732 --> 01:34:17.235
Well, maybe you should
just pray for shrimp.

1171
01:34:23.867 --> 01:34:26.536
So, I went to church every Sunday.

1172
01:34:27.787 --> 01:34:29.789
Sometimes Lieutenant Dan came, too,

1173
01:34:29.914 --> 01:34:32.917
though I think
he left the praying up to me.

1174
01:34:48.391 --> 01:34:52.770
- No shrimp.
- Where the hell's this God of yours?

1175
01:34:53.605 --> 01:34:59.319
It's funny Lieutenant Dan said that,
'cause right then, God showed up.

1176
01:35:16.169 --> 01:35:21.007
- You'll never sink this boat!
- Now, me, I was scared,

1177
01:35:21.132 --> 01:35:24.177
but Lieutenant Dan, he was mad.

1178
01:35:24.302 --> 01:35:25.637
Come on!

1179
01:35:28.765 --> 01:35:33.978
You call this a storm?
Come on, you son of a bitch!

1180
01:35:36.105 --> 01:35:40.485
It's time for a showdown! You and me!

1181
01:35:40.610 --> 01:35:44.489
I'm right here! Come and get me!

1182
01:35:46.282 --> 01:35:50.161
You'll never sink this boat!

1183
01:35:52.205 --> 01:35:54.374
Hurricane Carmen
came through here yesterday,

1184
01:35:54.499 --> 01:35:57.043
destroying nearly everything in its path.

1185
01:35:57.168 --> 01:35:59.671
And as in other towns
up and down the coast,

1186
01:35:59.837 --> 01:36:02.215
Bayou La Batre's
entire shrimping industry

1187
01:36:02.298 --> 01:36:06.177
has fallen victim to Carmen
and has been left in utter ruin.

1188
01:36:06.302 --> 01:36:09.472
Speaking with local officials,
this reporter has learned,

1189
01:36:09.514 --> 01:36:12.976
in fact, only one shrimping boat
actually survived the storm.

1190
01:36:13.351 --> 01:36:15.979
Louise. Louise, there's Forrest.

1191
01:36:16.688 --> 01:36:18.690
After that, shrimping was easy.

1192
01:36:24.362 --> 01:36:27.532
Since people still needed
them shrimps for shrimp cocktails

1193
01:36:27.573 --> 01:36:31.703
and barbecues and all,
and we were the only boat left standing,

1194
01:36:31.869 --> 01:36:35.164
Bubba-Gump Shrimp's what they got.

1195
01:36:35.206 --> 01:36:39.836
We got a whole bunch of boats,
12 Jennys,

1196
01:36:39.877 --> 01:36:43.381
a big old warehouse. We even have
hats that say "Bubba-Gump" on them.

1197
01:36:43.715 --> 01:36:47.010
Bubba-Gump Shrimp.
It's a household name.

1198
01:36:47.218 --> 01:36:48.928
Hold on there, boy.

1199
01:36:49.053 --> 01:36:53.599
Are you telling me you're the owner of
the Bubba-Gump Shrimp Corporation?

1200
01:36:53.725 --> 01:36:56.728
Yes, sir. We got more money
than Davy Crockett.

1201
01:36:58.354 --> 01:37:02.400
Boy, I heard some whoppers in my time,
but that tops them all.

1202
01:37:05.111 --> 01:37:07.905
We was sitting next to a millionaire.

1203
01:37:11.409 --> 01:37:16.039
Well, I thought it was a very lovely story,

1204
01:37:16.456 --> 01:37:21.085
and you tell it so well,
with such enthusiasm.

1205
01:37:22.795 --> 01:37:25.465
Would you like to see
what Lieutenant Dan looks like?

1206
01:37:25.590 --> 01:37:27.091
Well, yes, I would.

1207
01:37:32.305 --> 01:37:34.349
That's him right there.

1208
01:37:36.476 --> 01:37:38.728
And let me tell you something
about Lieutenant Dan...

1209
01:37:39.896 --> 01:37:40.938
Forrest,

1210
01:37:46.486 --> 01:37:49.280
I never thanked you for saving my life.

1211
01:38:15.306 --> 01:38:21.604
He never actually said so,
but I think he made his peace with God.

1212
01:38:29.278 --> 01:38:31.489
For the second time in 17 days,

1213
01:38:31.614 --> 01:38:35.076
President Ford escaped
possible assassination today.

1214
01:38:35.159 --> 01:38:36.494
Base to Jenny 1.

1215
01:38:36.536 --> 01:38:40.039
- Base to Jenny 1.
- Jenny 1. Go, Margo.

1216
01:38:40.123 --> 01:38:41.666
Forrest has a phone call.

1217
01:38:41.707 --> 01:38:44.210
Yeah, well, you'll have to tell them
to call him back.

1218
01:38:44.293 --> 01:38:47.672
- He is indisposed at the moment.
- His mama's sick.

1219
01:39:08.359 --> 01:39:10.736
- Where's Mama?
- She's upstairs.

1220
01:39:13.573 --> 01:39:15.533
Hi, Forrest.

1221
01:39:16.492 --> 01:39:19.036
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right.

1222
01:39:25.710 --> 01:39:28.880
We sure got you straightened out,
didn't we, boy?

1223
01:39:40.224 --> 01:39:44.187
- What's the matter, Mama?
- I'm dying, Forrest.

1224
01:39:47.523 --> 01:39:49.901
Come on in, sit down over here.

1225
01:40:04.248 --> 01:40:07.752
- Why are you dying, Mama?
- It's my time.

1226
01:40:08.753 --> 01:40:10.630
It's just my time.

1227
01:40:12.089 --> 01:40:16.260
Now, don't you be afraid, sweetheart.

1228
01:40:17.887 --> 01:40:20.264
Death is just a part of life,

1229
01:40:21.265 --> 01:40:23.893
something we're all destined to do.

1230
01:40:25.728 --> 01:40:30.107
I didn't know it,
but I was destined to be your mama.

1231
01:40:30.942 --> 01:40:34.529
- I did the best I could.
- You did good, Mama.

1232
01:40:35.321 --> 01:40:40.493
Well, I happen to believe
you make your own destiny.

1233
01:40:41.994 --> 01:40:45.248
You have to do the best
with what God gave you.

1234
01:40:49.126 --> 01:40:51.254
What's my destiny, Mama?

1235
01:40:53.422 --> 01:40:56.634
You're going to have
to figure that out for yourself.

1236
01:40:57.927 --> 01:41:00.930
Life is a box of chocolates, Forrest.

1237
01:41:00.972 --> 01:41:03.140
You never know
what you're going to get.

1238
01:41:03.266 --> 01:41:07.645
Mama always had a way of explaining
things so I could understand them.

1239
01:41:07.728 --> 01:41:09.939
I will miss you, Forrest.

1240
01:41:11.774 --> 01:41:15.820
She had got the cancer
and died on a Tuesday.

1241
01:41:17.321 --> 01:41:20.658
I bought her a new hat
with little flowers on it.

1242
01:41:23.703 --> 01:41:26.998
And that's all I have to say about that.

1243
01:41:33.838 --> 01:41:36.173
Didn't you say you were waiting
for the number seven bus?

1244
01:41:36.215 --> 01:41:39.010
There'll be another one along shortly.

1245
01:41:42.847 --> 01:41:46.475
Now, because I had been a football star,
and a war hero,

1246
01:41:46.517 --> 01:41:49.645
and a national celebrity,
and a shrimping boat captain,

1247
01:41:50.146 --> 01:41:53.357
and a college graduate,
the city fathers of Greenbow, Alabama

1248
01:41:53.482 --> 01:41:56.694
decided to get together
and offered me a fine job.

1249
01:41:58.070 --> 01:42:01.741
So, I never went back to work
for Lieutenant Dan,

1250
01:42:01.866 --> 01:42:04.577
though he did take care
of my Bubba-Gump money.

1251
01:42:04.702 --> 01:42:09.332
He got me invested
in some kind of fruit company.

1252
01:42:09.373 --> 01:42:11.013
And so then, I got a call from him saying

1253
01:42:11.042 --> 01:42:14.545
we don't have to worry about money
no more, and I said,

1254
01:42:14.587 --> 01:42:16.881
"That's good. One less thing."

1255
01:42:19.925 --> 01:42:23.304
Now, Mama said there's only
so much fortune a man really needs,

1256
01:42:24.555 --> 01:42:27.433
and the rest is just for showing off

1257
01:42:27.516 --> 01:42:31.395
So, I gave a whole bunch of it
to the Foursquare gospel church,

1258
01:42:34.065 --> 01:42:38.569
and I gave a whole bunch to the
Bayou La Batre fishing hospital.

1259
01:42:40.905 --> 01:42:45.451
And even though Bubba was dead
and Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts,

1260
01:42:45.576 --> 01:42:48.204
I gave Bubba's mama Bubba's share.

1261
01:42:52.416 --> 01:42:54.126
You know what?

1262
01:42:55.378 --> 01:42:58.422
She didn't have to work
in nobody's kitchen no more.

1263
01:42:58.464 --> 01:43:00.091
That smells wonderful.

1264
01:43:00.925 --> 01:43:04.887
And 'cause I was a gazillionaire
and I liked doing it so much,

1265
01:43:04.929 --> 01:43:07.264
I cut that grass for free.

1266
01:43:11.060 --> 01:43:13.938
But at night time
when there was nothing to do

1267
01:43:14.021 --> 01:43:16.399
and the house was all empty,

1268
01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:19.777
I'd always think of Jenny.

1269
01:44:23.466 --> 01:44:26.635
And then, she was there.

1270
01:44:59.627 --> 01:45:02.797
- Hello, Forrest.
- Hello, Jenny.

1271
01:45:14.350 --> 01:45:16.977
Jenny came back and stayed with me.

1272
01:45:18.562 --> 01:45:22.233
Maybe it was because
she had nowhere else to go,

1273
01:45:22.358 --> 01:45:26.070
or maybe it was because she was
so tired, 'cause she went to bed

1274
01:45:26.195 --> 01:45:30.157
and slept and slept,
like she hadn't slept in years.

1275
01:45:31.408 --> 01:45:33.702
It was wonderful having her home.

1276
01:45:35.037 --> 01:45:40.209
Every day we'd take a walk and
I'd jabber on like a monkey in a tree,

1277
01:45:40.251 --> 01:45:42.795
and she'd listen about Ping-Ponging,
and shrimping,

1278
01:45:42.878 --> 01:45:47.216
and Mama making a trip up to heaven.
I did all the talking.

1279
01:45:47.258 --> 01:45:50.594
Jenny most of the time was real quiet.

1280
01:46:30.759 --> 01:46:33.971
How could you do this?

1281
01:47:10.925 --> 01:47:14.261
Sometimes I guess there
just aren't enough rocks.

1282
01:47:16.472 --> 01:47:20.976
I never really knew why she came back,
but I didn't care.

1283
01:47:21.143 --> 01:47:25.439
It was like olden times.
We was like peas and carrots again.

1284
01:47:27.524 --> 01:47:31.862
Every day, I'd pick pretty flowers
and put them in her room for her,

1285
01:47:33.364 --> 01:47:36.992
and she gave me the best gift anyone
could ever get in the wide world.

1286
01:47:37.034 --> 01:47:39.870
- New shoes.
- They make them just for running.

1287
01:47:44.875 --> 01:47:48.170
And she even showed me
how to dance.

1288
01:47:56.345 --> 01:48:00.557
And, well, we was like family,
Jenny and me.

1289
01:48:04.311 --> 01:48:07.231
And it was the happiest time in my life.

1290
01:48:26.875 --> 01:48:28.669
And this Fourth is witnessing
one of the

1291
01:48:28.752 --> 01:48:31.755
largest fireworks displays
in the nation's...

1292
01:48:31.839 --> 01:48:34.758
- You done watching it?
- Here in New York Harbor...

1293
01:48:34.883 --> 01:48:36.736
- I'm going to bed.
- With a spectacular display

1294
01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:39.805
of tall ships earlier.
The Statue of Liberty...

1295
01:48:46.854 --> 01:48:48.856
Will you marry me?

1296
01:48:53.777 --> 01:48:56.739
I'd make a good husband, Jenny.

1297
01:48:59.408 --> 01:49:01.452
You would, Forrest.

1298
01:49:03.287 --> 01:49:05.622
But you won't marry me.

1299
01:49:07.916 --> 01:49:10.127
You don't want to marry me.

1300
01:49:13.714 --> 01:49:16.133
Why don't you love me, Jenny?

1301
01:49:21.138 --> 01:49:23.265
I'm not a smart man,

1302
01:49:24.975 --> 01:49:27.394
but I know what love is.

1303
01:50:04.431 --> 01:50:05.682
Jenny.

1304
01:50:07.601 --> 01:50:10.104
Forrest, I do love you.

1305
01:51:03.240 --> 01:51:06.910
- Where are you running off to?
- I'm not running.

1306
01:52:38.502 --> 01:52:43.840
That day, for no particular reason,
I decided to go for a little run.

1307
01:52:45.008 --> 01:52:49.429
So, I ran to the end of the road,
and when I got there,

1308
01:52:49.513 --> 01:52:51.265
I thought maybe I'd run
to the end of town.

1309
01:52:51.348 --> 01:52:54.601
President Carter, suffering from heat
exhaustion, fell into the arms of..

1310
01:52:54.685 --> 01:52:56.353
And when I got there,

1311
01:52:56.436 --> 01:53:00.607
I thought maybe I'd just
run across Greenbow County.

1312
01:53:00.691 --> 01:53:03.110
And I figured since I'd run this far,

1313
01:53:03.193 --> 01:53:06.488
maybe I'd just run across
the great state of Alabama.

1314
01:53:06.530 --> 01:53:07.739
And that's what I did.

1315
01:53:08.365 --> 01:53:10.158
I ran clear across Alabama.

1316
01:53:11.201 --> 01:53:14.371
For no particular reason,
I just kept on going.

1317
01:53:15.706 --> 01:53:17.291
I ran clear to the ocean.

1318
01:53:23.171 --> 01:53:26.341
And when I got there,
I figured since I'd gone this far,

1319
01:53:26.883 --> 01:53:29.720
might as well turn around
and just keep on going.

1320
01:53:33.473 --> 01:53:38.061
And when I got to another ocean,
I figured since I'd gone this far,

1321
01:53:39.855 --> 01:53:43.567
I might as well just turn back
and keep right on going.

1322
01:53:44.735 --> 01:53:49.573
When I got tired, I slept.
When I got hungry, I ate.

1323
01:53:49.656 --> 01:53:52.701
When I had to go, you know...

1324
01:53:54.328 --> 01:53:55.537
I went.

1325
01:53:55.579 --> 01:53:58.582
And so, you just ran.

1326
01:54:00.334 --> 01:54:01.418
Yeah.

1327
01:54:36.703 --> 01:54:41.958
I'd think a lot about Mama
and Bubba and Lieutenant Dan.

1328
01:54:42.959 --> 01:54:46.463
But most of all, I thought about Jenny.

1329
01:54:47.547 --> 01:54:49.716
I thought about her a lot.

1330
01:54:50.467 --> 01:54:53.595
For more than two years now,
a man named Forrest Gump,

1331
01:54:53.637 --> 01:54:57.057
a gardener from Greenbow, Alabama,
stopping only to sleep,

1332
01:54:57.140 --> 01:54:59.309
has been running across America.

1333
01:54:59.393 --> 01:55:01.395
Charles Cooper brings us this report.

1334
01:55:02.312 --> 01:55:04.731
For the fourth time
on his journey across America,

1335
01:55:04.815 --> 01:55:07.651
Forrest Gump,
the gardener from Greenbow, Alabama,

1336
01:55:07.776 --> 01:55:10.654
is about to cross
the Mississippi River again today.

1337
01:55:11.279 --> 01:55:13.383
- I'll be damned. Forrest?
- Sir, why are you running?

1338
01:55:13.407 --> 01:55:14.491
Why are you running?

1339
01:55:14.574 --> 01:55:16.159
Are you doing this for world peace?

1340
01:55:16.243 --> 01:55:17.637
Are you doing this for the homeless?

1341
01:55:17.661 --> 01:55:20.664
- Are you running for women's rights?
- Or for the environment?

1342
01:55:20.747 --> 01:55:21.790
Or for animals?

1343
01:55:21.832 --> 01:55:24.751
They just couldn't believe that
somebody would do all that running

1344
01:55:24.835 --> 01:55:26.211
for no particular reason.

1345
01:55:26.294 --> 01:55:28.296
Why are you doing this?

1346
01:55:28.338 --> 01:55:30.841
I just felt like running.

1347
01:55:30.966 --> 01:55:33.343
I just felt like running.

1348
01:55:33.468 --> 01:55:36.680
It's you. I can't believe it's really you.

1349
01:55:37.514 --> 01:55:42.644
Now, for some reason, what I was doing
seemed to make sense to people.

1350
01:55:42.811 --> 01:55:44.997
I mean, it was like an alarm
went off in my head, you know?

1351
01:55:45.021 --> 01:55:46.958
I said,
"Here's a guy that's got his act together.

1352
01:55:46.982 --> 01:55:48.984
"Here's somebody
who's got it all figured out.

1353
01:55:49.025 --> 01:55:53.155
"Here's somebody who has the answer."
I'll follow you anywhere, Mr. Gump.

1354
01:55:53.196 --> 01:55:55.031
So, I got company.

1355
01:55:56.867 --> 01:56:02.706
And after that, I got more company.
And then, even more people joined in.

1356
01:56:05.167 --> 01:56:08.378
Somebody later told me
it gave people hope.

1357
01:56:10.172 --> 01:56:13.550
Now... Now, I don't know
anything about that,

1358
01:56:14.384 --> 01:56:16.970
but some of those people
asked me if I could help them out.

1359
01:56:17.179 --> 01:56:20.432
Hey, man, hey, listen, I was wondering
if you might help me, huh?

1360
01:56:20.515 --> 01:56:22.267
Listen, I'm in the
bumper sticker business

1361
01:56:22.350 --> 01:56:24.162
and I've been trying
to think up a good slogan.

1362
01:56:24.186 --> 01:56:27.314
And since you have been such a big
inspiration to the people around here,

1363
01:56:27.397 --> 01:56:29.375
I thought you might
be able to help me jump into...

1364
01:56:29.399 --> 01:56:33.028
Whoa, man! You just ran through
a big pile of dog shit!

1365
01:56:34.571 --> 01:56:37.240
- It happens.
- What, shit?

1366
01:56:38.742 --> 01:56:40.702
Sometimes.

1367
01:56:42.579 --> 01:56:45.248
And some years later,
I heard that that fellow

1368
01:56:45.332 --> 01:56:46.958
did come up with
a bumper sticker slogan,

1369
01:56:47.042 --> 01:56:50.253
and he made a lot of money off of it.

1370
01:56:51.713 --> 01:56:53.924
Another time, I was running along,

1371
01:56:54.049 --> 01:56:57.385
somebody who had lost all his money
in the T-shirt business,

1372
01:56:57.427 --> 01:56:59.471
he wanted to put my face on a T-shirt,

1373
01:56:59.554 --> 01:57:02.557
but he couldn't draw that well,
and he didn't have a camera.

1374
01:57:02.599 --> 01:57:06.102
Here, use this one.
Nobody likes that color anyway.

1375
01:57:10.941 --> 01:57:12.609
Have a nice day.

1376
01:57:14.236 --> 01:57:15.362
Well, some years later,

1377
01:57:15.445 --> 01:57:19.366
I found out that that man
did come up with an idea for a T-shirt.

1378
01:57:19.449 --> 01:57:21.826
He made a lot of money off of it.

1379
01:57:24.621 --> 01:57:29.042
Anyway, like I was saying,
I had a lot of company.

1380
01:57:30.293 --> 01:57:31.461
My mama always said,

1381
01:57:31.545 --> 01:57:35.966
"You got to put the past behind you
before you can move on."

1382
01:57:37.634 --> 01:57:40.971
And I think that's what
my running was all about.

1383
01:57:41.805 --> 01:57:45.809
I had run for three years, two months,

1384
01:57:46.059 --> 01:57:48.395
14 days and 16 hours.

1385
01:58:04.077 --> 01:58:06.413
Quiet. Quiet.
He's going to say something.

1386
01:58:17.841 --> 01:58:19.593
I'm pretty tired.

1387
01:58:22.429 --> 01:58:24.472
Think I'll go home now.

1388
01:58:43.033 --> 01:58:45.493
Now what are we supposed to do?

1389
01:58:46.453 --> 01:58:50.707
And just like that,
my running days was over.

1390
01:58:52.667 --> 01:58:54.419
So, I went home to Alabama.

1391
01:58:55.211 --> 01:58:59.382
Moments ago, at 2:25 p.m.,
as President Reagan was leaving the...

1392
01:59:01.134 --> 01:59:05.305
five or six gunshots were fired
by an unknown would-be assassin.

1393
01:59:05.805 --> 01:59:08.183
The President was shot in the chest,
and the assailant...

1394
01:59:08.224 --> 01:59:10.185
I picked up the mail.

1395
01:59:10.977 --> 01:59:14.856
And one day, out of the blue clear sky,
I got a letter from Jenny,

1396
01:59:14.898 --> 01:59:19.194
wondering if I could come down
to Savannah and see her,

1397
01:59:19.235 --> 01:59:21.821
and that's what I'm doing here.

1398
01:59:21.905 --> 01:59:24.532
She saw me on TV, running.

1399
01:59:24.574 --> 01:59:28.828
I'm supposed to go on the
number nine bus to Richmond Street

1400
01:59:28.912 --> 01:59:35.835
and get off and go one block left
to 1947 Henry Street, Apartment 4.

1401
01:59:35.919 --> 01:59:39.589
Why, you don't need to take a bus.

1402
01:59:39.714 --> 01:59:44.260
Henry Street is just five
or six blocks down that way.

1403
01:59:46.096 --> 01:59:48.431
- Down that way?
- Down that way.

1404
01:59:51.434 --> 01:59:53.353
It was nice talking to you.

1405
01:59:54.396 --> 01:59:57.023
I hope everything works out for you!

1406
02:00:04.781 --> 02:00:06.449
Hey!

1407
02:00:06.866 --> 02:00:08.535
Forrest!

1408
02:00:08.785 --> 02:00:12.038
How you doing? Come in, come in!

1409
02:00:12.122 --> 02:00:13.331
I got your letter.

1410
02:00:13.415 --> 02:00:16.042
I was wondering about that.

1411
02:00:17.585 --> 02:00:19.421
Is this your house?

1412
02:00:19.462 --> 02:00:22.549
Yeah. It's messy right now.
I just got off work.

1413
02:00:22.632 --> 02:00:26.344
It's nice. You got air conditioning.

1414
02:00:33.226 --> 02:00:35.270
- Thank you.
- I ate some.

1415
02:00:38.064 --> 02:00:43.486
Hey, I kept a scrapbook
of your clippings and everything.

1416
02:00:43.611 --> 02:00:45.238
There you are.

1417
02:00:46.990 --> 02:00:48.110
And this, I got you running.

1418
02:00:51.161 --> 02:00:53.329
I ran a long way,

1419
02:00:53.830 --> 02:00:55.665
for a long time.

1420
02:00:57.876 --> 02:00:59.377
And there...

1421
02:01:05.884 --> 02:01:09.345
Listen, Forrest,
I don't know how to say this.

1422
02:01:11.848 --> 02:01:16.186
I just I want to apologize
for anything that I ever did to you,

1423
02:01:16.311 --> 02:01:21.566
'cause I was messed up
for a long time, and...

1424
02:01:24.360 --> 02:01:25.987
- Hey.
- Hi.

1425
02:01:26.196 --> 02:01:27.197
Hey, you.

1426
02:01:28.364 --> 02:01:31.367
- This is an old friend from Alabama.
- How do you do?

1427
02:01:31.409 --> 02:01:34.537
Listen, next week my schedule changes,
so I'll be able to... But thanks...

1428
02:01:34.579 --> 02:01:36.623
No problem. Got to go, Jen,
I'm double-parked.

1429
02:01:36.706 --> 02:01:38.583
- Okay. Thanks.
- Bye.

1430
02:01:42.045 --> 02:01:44.839
This is my very good friend, Mr. Gump.
Can you say hi to him?

1431
02:01:44.881 --> 02:01:48.009
- Hello, Mr. Gump.
- Hello.

1432
02:01:48.051 --> 02:01:51.054
- Can I go watch TV now?
- Yes, you can. Just keep it low.

1433
02:01:53.890 --> 02:01:57.227
- You're a mama, Jenny.
- I'm a mama.

1434
02:02:00.104 --> 02:02:01.940
His name's Forrest.

1435
02:02:03.066 --> 02:02:04.400
Like me.

1436
02:02:06.027 --> 02:02:08.154
I named him after his daddy.

1437
02:02:09.113 --> 02:02:11.574
He got a daddy named Forrest, too?

1438
02:02:12.867 --> 02:02:14.911
You're his daddy, Forrest.

1439
02:02:29.384 --> 02:02:30.593
Hey.

1440
02:02:31.761 --> 02:02:34.639
Forrest, look at me.
Look at me, Forrest.

1441
02:02:37.225 --> 02:02:41.354
There's nothing you need to do, okay?
You didn't do anything wrong.

1442
02:02:41.896 --> 02:02:43.273
Okay?

1443
02:02:47.610 --> 02:02:49.487
Isn't he beautiful?

1444
02:02:50.488 --> 02:02:53.449
He's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1445
02:02:57.245 --> 02:02:58.329
But...

1446
02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.919
Is he smart, or...

1447
02:03:04.961 --> 02:03:08.965
He's very smart.
He's one of the smartest in his class.

1448
02:03:18.308 --> 02:03:20.768
Yeah, it's okay. Go talk to him.

1449
02:03:30.111 --> 02:03:32.947
- What are you watching?
- Bert and Ernie.

1450
02:03:56.054 --> 02:03:57.847
Forrest,

1451
02:03:59.307 --> 02:04:00.850
I'm sick.

1452
02:04:03.519 --> 02:04:07.190
What, do you have
a cough due to a cold?

1453
02:04:07.231 --> 02:04:09.651
I have some kind of virus,

1454
02:04:09.692 --> 02:04:12.403
and the doctors don't...
They don't know what it is,

1455
02:04:12.528 --> 02:04:15.531
and there isn't anything
they can do about it.

1456
02:04:19.911 --> 02:04:22.205
You could come home with me.

1457
02:04:23.873 --> 02:04:29.545
Jenny, you and little Forrest could
come stay at my house in Greenbow.

1458
02:04:33.883 --> 02:04:36.678
I'll take care of you if you're sick.

1459
02:04:39.055 --> 02:04:41.349
Would you marry me, Forrest?

1460
02:04:46.604 --> 02:04:47.855
Okay.

1461
02:04:48.898 --> 02:04:50.566
Please take your seats.

1462
02:04:54.404 --> 02:04:56.739
Forrest? It's time to start.

1463
02:05:16.134 --> 02:05:17.719
Hi.

1464
02:05:18.594 --> 02:05:20.096
Your tie.

1465
02:05:32.650 --> 02:05:34.277
Lieutenant Dan.

1466
02:05:49.625 --> 02:05:51.586
Lieutenant Dan.

1467
02:05:52.420 --> 02:05:54.088
Hello, Forrest.

1468
02:05:54.756 --> 02:05:57.425
You got new legs. New legs!

1469
02:05:58.634 --> 02:06:02.430
Yeah. I got new legs. Custom-made.

1470
02:06:03.139 --> 02:06:07.143
Titanium alloy.
It's what they use on the space shuttle.

1471
02:06:10.980 --> 02:06:12.482
Magic legs.

1472
02:06:14.484 --> 02:06:18.863
This is my fiancée, Susan.

1473
02:06:21.657 --> 02:06:25.036
- Lieutenant Dan.
- Hi, Forrest.

1474
02:06:27.121 --> 02:06:30.333
Lieutenant Dan, this is my Jenny.

1475
02:06:30.708 --> 02:06:33.711
Hey. It's nice to meet you finally.

1476
02:06:43.846 --> 02:06:48.017
Do you, Forrest,
take Jenny to be your wife?

1477
02:06:49.894 --> 02:06:54.148
Do you, Jenny,
take Forrest to be your husband?

1478
02:06:55.483 --> 02:06:58.861
And so I pronounce you man and wife.

1479
02:07:29.725 --> 02:07:31.602
- Hey.
- Hey.

1480
02:07:45.283 --> 02:07:47.076
Hey, Forrest.

1481
02:07:52.415 --> 02:07:54.208
Were you scared in Vietnam?

1482
02:07:55.877 --> 02:07:58.212
Yes. Well, I...

1483
02:07:59.547 --> 02:08:01.257
I don't know.

1484
02:08:01.966 --> 02:08:06.929
Sometimes it would stop raining long
enough for the stars to come out.

1485
02:08:10.057 --> 02:08:12.101
And then it was nice.

1486
02:08:15.479 --> 02:08:19.442
It was like just before the sun
goes to bed down on the bayou.

1487
02:08:20.735 --> 02:08:24.614
There was always
a million sparkles on the water.

1488
02:08:26.407 --> 02:08:30.328
Like that mountain lake.
It was so clear, Jenny,

1489
02:08:30.453 --> 02:08:35.041
it looked like there were two skies,
one on top of the other.

1490
02:08:37.585 --> 02:08:40.630
And then, in the desert,
when the sun comes up,

1491
02:08:43.090 --> 02:08:47.261
I couldn't tell where heaven stopped

1492
02:08:47.803 --> 02:08:50.181
and the earth began.

1493
02:08:51.432 --> 02:08:53.309
It was so beautiful.

1494
02:08:58.022 --> 02:09:01.108
I wish I could've been there with you.

1495
02:09:04.195 --> 02:09:05.613
You were.

1496
02:09:16.332 --> 02:09:17.792
I love you.

1497
02:09:22.171 --> 02:09:25.508
You died on a Saturday morning.

1498
02:09:27.218 --> 02:09:30.972
And I had you placed
here under our tree.

1499
02:09:35.851 --> 02:09:40.690
And I had that house of your father's
bulldozed to the ground.

1500
02:09:44.819 --> 02:09:46.487
Mama

1501
02:09:47.571 --> 02:09:52.576
always said that dying was a part of life.

1502
02:09:55.997 --> 02:09:58.332
I sure wish it wasn't.

1503
02:10:01.002 --> 02:10:04.755
Little Forrest is doing just fine.

1504
02:10:06.090 --> 02:10:07.174
But...

1505
02:10:07.425 --> 02:10:10.094
About to start school again soon,

1506
02:10:11.929 --> 02:10:15.725
and I make his breakfast, lunch
and dinner every day.

1507
02:10:17.893 --> 02:10:23.899
I make sure he combs his hair
and brushes his teeth every day.

1508
02:10:27.028 --> 02:10:29.613
Teaching him how to play Ping-Pong.

1509
02:10:30.906 --> 02:10:31.949
Okay.

1510
02:10:32.199 --> 02:10:33.409
He's really good.

1511
02:10:33.451 --> 02:10:35.578
Forrest, you go.

1512
02:10:39.790 --> 02:10:41.375
We fish a lot.

1513
02:10:44.920 --> 02:10:48.382
And every night, we read a book.
He's so smart, Jenny.

1514
02:10:51.635 --> 02:10:53.888
You'd be so proud of him.

1515
02:10:55.598 --> 02:10:57.058
I am.

1516
02:10:58.100 --> 02:11:01.312
He wrote you a letter.

1517
02:11:02.897 --> 02:11:04.940
And he says I can't read it.

1518
02:11:05.066 --> 02:11:08.611
I'm not supposed to,
so I'll just leave it here for you.

1519
02:11:24.668 --> 02:11:26.003
Jenny,

1520
02:11:31.801 --> 02:11:35.012
I don't know if Mama was right,

1521
02:11:36.347 --> 02:11:37.848
or if it's Lieutenant Dan.

1522
02:11:37.973 --> 02:11:40.601
I don't know

1523
02:11:40.643 --> 02:11:45.147
if we each have a destiny,

1524
02:11:47.191 --> 02:11:52.321
or if we're all just floating around
accidental-like on a breeze.

1525
02:11:56.826 --> 02:11:58.661
But I think

1526
02:12:00.538 --> 02:12:02.331
maybe it's both.

1527
02:12:06.669 --> 02:12:09.547
Maybe both is happening
at the same time.

1528
02:12:15.678 --> 02:12:17.680
But I miss you, Jenny.

1529
02:12:24.061 --> 02:12:28.482
If there's anything you need,
I won't be far away.

1530
02:13:03.767 --> 02:13:06.729
Here's your bus. Okay.

1531
02:13:08.397 --> 02:13:11.734
Hey. I know this.

1532
02:13:11.859 --> 02:13:14.737
I'm gonna show that
for show-and-tell because

1533
02:13:14.862 --> 02:13:17.573
Grandma used to read it to you.

1534
02:13:17.615 --> 02:13:19.742
My favorite book.

1535
02:13:23.078 --> 02:13:24.580
Here we are.

1536
02:13:24.747 --> 02:13:26.207
Okay.

1537
02:13:27.917 --> 02:13:29.418
Here you go.

1538
02:13:34.298 --> 02:13:36.800
Hey, Forrest, don't...

1539
02:13:40.262 --> 02:13:43.974
- I wanted to tell you, I love you.
- I love you, too, Daddy.

1540
02:13:45.976 --> 02:13:48.771
I'll be right here when you get back.

1541
02:13:53.317 --> 02:13:56.612
You understand this is
the bus to school, now, don't you?

1542
02:13:56.654 --> 02:14:00.199
Of course, and you are Dorothy Harris,
and I'm Forrest Gump.
