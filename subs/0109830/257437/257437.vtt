00:00:17,025 --> 00:00:21,151
In May 1980, Fidel Castro opened
the harbor at Mariel, Cuba,

2
00:00:21,234 --> 00:00:25,111
with the apparent intention
of letting some of his people

3
00:00:25,236 --> 00:00:28,404
join their relatives
in the United States.

4
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:32,824
Within seventy-two hours, 3,000
U.S. Boats were headed for Cuba.

5
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:36,158
It soon became evident that Castro
was forcing the boat owners

6
00:00:36,283 --> 00:00:39,493
to carry back with them
not only their relatives

7
00:00:39,577 --> 00:00:42,160
but the dregs of his jails.

8
00:00:42,285 --> 00:00:45,453
Of the 125,000 refugees
that landed in Florida,

9
00:00:45,536 --> 00:00:48,831
an estimated 25,000
had criminal records.

10
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,208
...they are unwilling to adapt
to the spirit of our revolution.

11
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:56,499
We don't want them!
We don't need them!

12
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:10,047
MARIEL HARBOUR, CUBA

13
00:03:33,938 --> 00:03:35,731
What do you call yourself?

14
00:03:37,482 --> 00:03:42,234
Antonio Montana.
And you, what you call yourself?

15
00:03:42,526 --> 00:03:45,694
Where'd you learn English, Tony?
In school.

16
00:03:46,404 --> 00:03:49,070
And my father,
he was from the United States.

17
00:03:49,905 --> 00:03:51,613
Just like you, you know?

18
00:03:52,363 --> 00:03:53,905
He was a Yankee.

19
00:03:54,531 --> 00:03:56,490
He used to take me a lot
to the movies.

20
00:03:56,573 --> 00:03:57,657
I learned.

21
00:03:57,782 --> 00:04:01,574
I watch the guys
like Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney.

22
00:04:03,075 --> 00:04:06,994
They teach me to talk.
I like those guys.

23
00:04:07,077 --> 00:04:10,579
I always know one day
I'm coming here, United States.

24
00:04:10,704 --> 00:04:14,415
So where's your old man now?
He dead. He die.

25
00:04:14,665 --> 00:04:16,665
Sometime. Somewhere.

26
00:04:16,748 --> 00:04:18,999
Mother?
She dead, too.

27
00:04:19,207 --> 00:04:22,251
What work you do in Cuba?
You know, things.

28
00:04:22,334 --> 00:04:25,377
I was this, that.

29
00:04:26,294 --> 00:04:27,835
Construction business.

30
00:04:28,585 --> 00:04:31,587
I work a lot with my hands.
I was in the Army.

31
00:04:31,921 --> 00:04:34,839
Any family in the States?
Cousins, brother-in-law?

32
00:04:34,923 --> 00:04:38,089
Nobody. Everybody's dead.

33
00:04:38,424 --> 00:04:40,216
You ever been to jail, Tony?

34
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,968
Me? Jail? No way, no.

35
00:04:44,343 --> 00:04:48,720
Been in a mental hospital?
Yeah. On the boat coming over.

36
00:04:50,095 --> 00:04:53,138
What about homosexuality, Tony?
You like men?

37
00:04:53,346 --> 00:04:55,888
<i>You like to dress up like a woman?</i>

38
00:04:56,471 --> 00:04:59,058
What is wrong with this guy?
He kidding me or what?

39
00:04:59,141 --> 00:05:01,392
Just answer the questions, Tony.

40
00:05:01,684 --> 00:05:03,643
Okay. No.

41
00:05:04,768 --> 00:05:05,894
<i>Fuck, no.</i>

42
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:09,770
Arrested for vagrancy? Marijuana?

43
00:05:09,937 --> 00:05:11,520
Never, man.
Heroin?

44
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:14,021
Cocaine?
No.

45
00:05:15,814 --> 00:05:19,148
Where'd you get the beauty
scar, tough guy? Eating pussy?

46
00:05:20,607 --> 00:05:23,902
How am I gonna get a scar like that
eating pussy?

47
00:05:24,694 --> 00:05:27,069
This was when I was a kid, you know?

48
00:05:28,236 --> 00:05:31,361
You should see the other kid.
You can't recognize him.

49
00:05:31,486 --> 00:05:32,655
And this?

50
00:05:33,447 --> 00:05:35,947
What? That's nothing.
That's from my sweetheart.

51
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:39,574
Sweetheart, my ass! We've
been seeing more and more of these.

52
00:05:39,824 --> 00:05:42,284
<i>Some kind of code
these guys used in the can.</i>

53
00:05:42,367 --> 00:05:44,909
<i>Pitchfork means an assassin
or something.</i>

54
00:05:44,992 --> 00:05:46,451
<i>You want to tell us about it...</i>

55
00:05:46,534 --> 00:05:49,494
<i>or you want to take a trip
to the detention centre?</i>

56
00:05:51,245 --> 00:05:53,496
Okay, you got me.

57
00:05:53,705 --> 00:05:57,539
I was in the can one time.
For buying dollars. Big deal.

58
00:05:57,706 --> 00:05:59,916
That's pretty funny, Tony.
That's true.

59
00:05:59,999 --> 00:06:01,834
It was a Canadian tourist.

60
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:04,167
Did you mug him first?
Get him out of here!

61
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,543
Come on!
So I fuck up!

62
00:06:06,835 --> 00:06:10,002
Let me talk to this guy. Please!
Let me talk to him a minute.

63
00:06:10,086 --> 00:06:11,379
You a Communist?

64
00:06:14,213 --> 00:06:15,671
How'd you like it?

65
00:06:15,754 --> 00:06:19,632
They tell you always what to do,
what to think, what to feel.

66
00:06:19,716 --> 00:06:23,217
Do you want to be like a sheep?
Like all those other people?

67
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,425
I don't have to listen to this!

68
00:06:25,508 --> 00:06:29,552
You wanna work 8, 10 fucking hours?
You own nothing, you got nothing!

69
00:06:31,053 --> 00:06:33,053
<i>Do you want a chivato
on every corner...</i>

70
00:06:33,136 --> 00:06:34,596
watching everything you do?

71
00:06:34,679 --> 00:06:36,348
Everything you say, man?

72
00:06:37,098 --> 00:06:39,182
You know I eat octopus
three times a day?

73
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:41,600
I got fucking octopus
coming out of my ears.

74
00:06:41,683 --> 00:06:45,059
I got fucking Russian shoes,
my feet's coming through.

75
00:06:45,602 --> 00:06:47,143
How'd you like that?

76
00:06:47,727 --> 00:06:50,353
You want me to stay there
and do nothing?

77
00:06:50,436 --> 00:06:53,812
<i>I'm no fucking criminal, man.
I'm no puta or thief.</i>

78
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,647
I'm Tony Montana,
a political prisoner from Cuba.

79
00:06:58,231 --> 00:07:00,941
I want my fucking human rights, now!

80
00:07:01,024 --> 00:07:04,067
Like President Jimmy Carter says.
Okay?

81
00:07:05,318 --> 00:07:08,318
Carter should see this human right.
He's really good.

82
00:07:08,401 --> 00:07:11,153
- What do you say?
- I don't believe any of this shit!

83
00:07:11,278 --> 00:07:15,488
They all sound alike to me.
That Castro is shitting all over us.

84
00:07:15,571 --> 00:07:18,489
Send the bastard to Freedom Town.
Let them see him.

85
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:20,657
Get him out of here.
Know something?

86
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:21,824
You can send me anywhere.

87
00:07:21,907 --> 00:07:24,199
Here, there, this, that.
It don't matter.

88
00:07:24,282 --> 00:07:27,243
There's nothing you can do to me
that Castro hasn't done...

89
00:07:27,326 --> 00:07:28,660
Get him out of here!

90
00:07:31,161 --> 00:07:33,245
So?
So?

91
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:35,662
What'd you tell them?

92
00:07:35,787 --> 00:07:40,540
What you told me to tell them.
That we... I was in sanitation.

93
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:43,415
They didn't go for it.

94
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,876
- Sanitation?
- Yeah.

95
00:07:46,126 --> 00:07:51,503
I told you to tell them you was
in a sanatarium, not sanitation.

96
00:07:52,586 --> 00:07:55,421
- Sanatarium. Yeah.
- You didn't tell me that.

97
00:07:55,505 --> 00:08:00,423
No, I told you to say you had TB
and you was in a sanatarium.

98
00:08:00,632 --> 00:08:01,923
You was cured.

99
00:08:02,757 --> 00:08:06,509
- When did you tell me that?
- You should've kept your mouth shut.

100
00:08:06,592 --> 00:08:08,926
They'd think you was a horse
and let you out.

101
00:08:14,638 --> 00:08:20,015
ONE MONTH LATER

102
00:09:09,785 --> 00:09:11,743
Tony! Montana!

103
00:09:12,411 --> 00:09:14,871
Tony Montana! Come here.

104
00:09:15,913 --> 00:09:18,247
Come here, man. I gotta talk to you.

105
00:09:18,455 --> 00:09:20,414
<i>Come on, man. It's important.</i>

106
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:23,457
So close, man.
Come on.

107
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,918
- I gotta talk to you.
- Where are you going?

108
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:29,209
- Leave him alone.
- I got better things to do.

109
00:09:29,376 --> 00:09:31,544
You're chicken, man.
You almost made it.

110
00:09:31,627 --> 00:09:34,254
Are you ready for some good news?

111
00:09:34,754 --> 00:09:36,505
Sure. What you got, man?

112
00:09:36,588 --> 00:09:38,672
We can be outta this place
in 30 days.

113
00:09:38,755 --> 00:09:42,257
Not only that, but we got
a green card and a job in Miami.

114
00:09:42,424 --> 00:09:44,674
Now are we made or are we made, man?

115
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:48,133
What do we gotta do?
Go to Cuba and hit the Beard?

116
00:09:48,216 --> 00:09:50,926
- No, man, somebody else.
- You're kidding?

117
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:53,554
- No.
- You're not kidding?

118
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:57,805
Guy named Rebenga, man.
Emilio Rebenga.

119
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,056
Rebenga?

120
00:10:00,056 --> 00:10:02,557
- I know that name.
- Yeah?

121
00:10:02,682 --> 00:10:04,223
- He's political.
- Yeah.

122
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,100
Well, he's coming in here
today. Castro just sprung him.

123
00:10:08,434 --> 00:10:12,060
<i>This guy was one of the top dogs
for Fidel in the early days.</i>

124
00:10:12,476 --> 00:10:16,772
Castro felt he couldn't trust him
and threw him in jail.

125
00:10:17,189 --> 00:10:20,189
<i>But while he was on top,
he tortured a few guys to death.</i>

126
00:10:20,272 --> 00:10:23,606
<i>One of the guy's brothers
is a rich guy in Miami now.</i>

127
00:10:23,731 --> 00:10:25,148
<i>He wants the favor repaid.</i>

128
00:10:25,357 --> 00:10:27,025
That's where we come in.

129
00:10:28,942 --> 00:10:30,943
It's ugly, man.

130
00:10:32,026 --> 00:10:33,027
Yeah.

131
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:42,698
You tell your guys in Miami,
your friend...

132
00:10:43,365 --> 00:10:45,075
it'd be a pleasure.

133
00:10:45,491 --> 00:10:47,616
I'd kill a Communist for fun...

134
00:10:48,366 --> 00:10:52,203
but for a green card,
I gonna carve him up real nice.

135
00:10:52,536 --> 00:10:55,412
MIAMI, FLORIDA, AUGUST 11, 1980.
HUNDREDS OF CUBAN REFUGEES

136
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:58,287
BEGAN RIOTING THIS MORNING
AT A DETENTION CENTRE SITUATED

137
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:01,456
UNDER INTERSTATE 95 IN NORTH MIAMI,
BURNING TENTS AND ATTACKING

138
00:11:01,539 --> 00:11:04,833
IMMIGRATION AND NATURALISATION
GUARDS WITH PIPES, STICKS AND ROCKS.

139
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:08,816
<i>Libertad! Libertad!</i>

140
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,402
Rebenga!

141
00:12:52,918 --> 00:12:54,710
From a friend you fucked!

142
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:28,306
That face. That's nice.

143
00:13:31,434 --> 00:13:34,519
- That doesn't look like me.
- That looks pretty, man.

144
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:09,241
Fuck!

145
00:14:13,659 --> 00:14:16,411
Your big shot friend better
come up with something soon.

146
00:14:16,536 --> 00:14:19,077
I didn't come to the U.S.
To break my fucking back.

147
00:14:19,202 --> 00:14:21,621
He's coming!
What do you want from me?

148
00:14:22,538 --> 00:14:23,788
Fucking thing!

149
00:14:24,121 --> 00:14:25,205
I told you.

150
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,124
What's wrong?

151
00:14:43,462 --> 00:14:44,589
Look at that one.

152
00:14:44,714 --> 00:14:47,257
That one in the pink.
She's beautiful.

153
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,091
<i>Look at those titties.</i>

154
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,591
Look at that punk with her.

155
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:54,218
What's he got that I don't have?

156
00:14:55,135 --> 00:14:58,468
Well, he's very handsome,
for one thing, you know?

157
00:15:02,012 --> 00:15:04,138
I mean, look at the way he dresses.

158
00:15:04,221 --> 00:15:07,764
Come on.
That's style, flash, pizzazz.

159
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:10,934
And a little coke money
doesn't hurt nobody.

160
00:15:15,185 --> 00:15:16,435
Look at this.

161
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,812
Fucking onions.

162
00:15:21,562 --> 00:15:24,479
They ought to be picking gold
from the street.

163
00:15:28,566 --> 00:15:31,316
There's two guys
looking for you out there.

164
00:15:33,359 --> 00:15:35,609
<i>That's him, man. That's El mono.
I told you.</i>

165
00:15:35,693 --> 00:15:37,444
Don't stay too fucking long.

166
00:15:37,527 --> 00:15:39,903
We've got a lot of work to do.

167
00:15:59,661 --> 00:16:01,578
Waldo! Good to see you, man.

168
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:05,164
This is my friend, Tony Montana,
I've been telling you about.

169
00:16:05,247 --> 00:16:08,582
<i>Tony, that's Omar Suarez,
and that's Waldo Rojas over there.</i>

170
00:16:08,957 --> 00:16:10,498
I got something for you.

171
00:16:10,582 --> 00:16:12,625
Yeah? What do we gotta do?

172
00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:16,167
Gotta unload a boat. Marijuana.
45 tons. You get $500 each.

173
00:16:16,292 --> 00:16:20,836
- $500? That's great.
- You gotta be kidding.

174
00:16:24,088 --> 00:16:25,339
$500?

175
00:16:26,714 --> 00:16:29,215
Who do you think we are,
baggage handlers?

176
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:34,342
The going rate on a boat
is $1,000 a night.

177
00:16:34,425 --> 00:16:35,467
You know that.

178
00:16:35,842 --> 00:16:38,384
First you gotta work
your way up to $500.

179
00:16:38,468 --> 00:16:41,010
What I did for you in Freedom Town,
what was that?

180
00:16:41,135 --> 00:16:43,261
That Rebenga hit
was a game of dominoes?

181
00:16:43,345 --> 00:16:45,971
- That was something else.
- Shut up! Take it easy.

182
00:16:46,054 --> 00:16:48,599
<i>What's with this dishwasher, chico?</i>

183
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:52,350
Don't he know we could've got any
space cadet to hit Rebenga cheaper?

184
00:16:52,433 --> 00:16:54,766
- $50!
- Then why didn't you?

185
00:16:54,891 --> 00:16:58,268
Don't call me no fucking dishwasher,
or I'll kick your monkey ass.

186
00:16:58,352 --> 00:17:00,018
Who the fuck are you?

187
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,811
You can't do that, man!

188
00:17:02,894 --> 00:17:05,146
The Colombians!

189
00:17:09,356 --> 00:17:11,399
Okay, all right, big man!

190
00:17:11,483 --> 00:17:15,067
You want to make some big bucks?
Let's see how tough you are.

191
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,526
You know something about cocaine?

192
00:17:22,027 --> 00:17:23,654
You kidding me or what?

193
00:17:25,071 --> 00:17:27,614
There's a bunch of Colombians
coming in Friday.

194
00:17:27,697 --> 00:17:31,698
<i>New guys. They say they got
two keys for us, for openers.</i>

195
00:17:31,782 --> 00:17:35,826
Pure coke. Hotel in Miami Beach.
I want you to go over there.

196
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:38,326
If it's what they say,
pay 'em and bring it back.

197
00:17:38,451 --> 00:17:40,494
Do that, you get $5,000.

198
00:17:43,454 --> 00:17:45,580
Go, pay them, bring it back, yeah?

199
00:17:48,955 --> 00:17:51,165
You know how to handle
a machine gun?

200
00:17:51,249 --> 00:17:53,374
Yeah, man. We were in the Army.

201
00:17:53,499 --> 00:17:57,083
- You gonna need a couple other guys.
- That's no problem.

202
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,294
Be at Hector's Bodega
at noon Friday.

203
00:18:00,378 --> 00:18:02,254
You get the buy money then.

204
00:18:04,045 --> 00:18:08,547
If anything happens
to that buy money...

205
00:18:08,631 --> 00:18:11,382
my boss will stick your heads
up your asses...

206
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,673
faster than a rabbit gets fucked!

207
00:18:13,757 --> 00:18:15,174
I'm scared.

208
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:20,010
- You're pushing your luck.
- Don't worry.

209
00:18:20,135 --> 00:18:23,219
- That was dumb.
- You worry too much.

210
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:24,804
You'll have a heart attack.

211
00:18:24,888 --> 00:18:28,055
You act like that guy's
doing you a favor or something.

212
00:18:28,139 --> 00:18:32,056
- What's this with the Colombians?
- What does it matter?

213
00:18:32,265 --> 00:18:36,267
He says "Colombians,"
and you make these eyes...

214
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:39,518
I don't like fucking Colombians,
okay?

215
00:18:40,768 --> 00:18:42,144
What you guys doing?

216
00:18:42,227 --> 00:18:44,271
There's a lot of dishes
to be washed.

217
00:18:44,437 --> 00:18:46,104
Wash 'em yourself.

218
00:18:47,396 --> 00:18:48,439
I retire!

219
00:18:48,814 --> 00:18:51,064
What the fuck you gonna do now?

220
00:18:51,273 --> 00:18:54,525
- Don't come back here!
- I gotta look after my investment!

221
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:57,983
Fuck you guys!
Close the shop!

222
00:19:13,699 --> 00:19:16,366
Look at those tits.
She's begging for it.

223
00:19:16,449 --> 00:19:19,868
Are you fucking crazy?
She's 103 years old.

224
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:22,620
Not that one, man! That one!

225
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,703
Which one?
The young one.

226
00:19:24,787 --> 00:19:27,622
Move the fucking car.
We're at a stop sign.

227
00:19:30,372 --> 00:19:33,915
We're just staying loose up here.
You gotta stay loose.

228
00:19:33,998 --> 00:19:36,499
You can't worry.
You'll have a heart attack.

229
00:19:36,582 --> 00:19:41,085
Just play it cool. Miami Beach.
Miami Beach, man!

230
00:20:02,804 --> 00:20:05,012
The money stays in the trunk
till I come out.

231
00:20:05,095 --> 00:20:07,638
You got it? Me, nobody else. Okay.

232
00:20:08,096 --> 00:20:11,807
I'm not out in 15 minutes,
something's wrong. Okay?

233
00:20:12,015 --> 00:20:15,348
Room 9. You ready?
Sure thing.

234
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:17,834
Okay.
You mind leaving the door open?

235
00:21:17,917 --> 00:21:20,085
So my brother-in-law sees
everything's okay.

236
00:21:20,168 --> 00:21:22,168
Sure. No problem.

237
00:21:23,461 --> 00:21:24,712
No problem.

238
00:21:26,087 --> 00:21:29,003
Hello. This is Marta.

239
00:21:33,297 --> 00:21:34,840
Marta, hello.

240
00:21:37,299 --> 00:21:39,049
I am Hector.

241
00:21:39,676 --> 00:21:41,094
And I am Tony.

242
00:21:45,428 --> 00:21:47,886
So, Omar says you're okay.

243
00:21:48,011 --> 00:21:51,763
Yeah? Good. Omar's okay.

244
00:21:52,847 --> 00:21:54,056
Okay.

245
00:21:59,684 --> 00:22:02,101
So, you got the money?

246
00:22:05,686 --> 00:22:07,019
You got the stuff?

247
00:22:07,145 --> 00:22:10,813
Sure I have the stuff,
but not right here with me now.

248
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:12,563
I got it close by.

249
00:22:16,733 --> 00:22:19,234
I don't have the money either, man.

250
00:22:21,109 --> 00:22:23,025
I have it close by, too.

251
00:22:25,069 --> 00:22:26,069
Where?

252
00:22:27,944 --> 00:22:29,113
In the car?

253
00:22:30,363 --> 00:22:33,280
No, not in the car, man.
No?

254
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,907
How about you?
Where you have your stuff?

255
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:40,658
Not far.

256
00:22:48,536 --> 00:22:52,121
Okay. You want me to come in?
We start over again?

257
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,249
Where you from, Tony?

258
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:58,666
What the fuck difference
does it make where I'm from?

259
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:01,584
Take it easy, man.

260
00:23:03,377 --> 00:23:05,877
I just want to get to know
who I do business with.

261
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:10,504
You'll know me once you do business
with me and stop fucking around.

262
00:23:11,087 --> 00:23:12,170
Okay?

263
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,296
What's the story?
Tony!

264
00:23:23,968 --> 00:23:28,095
You know, Frog Face,
you just fucked yourself.

265
00:23:28,803 --> 00:23:31,303
- You steal from me, you're dead.
- Yeah?

266
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:38,182
You want to give me the cash...

267
00:23:39,432 --> 00:23:41,809
or do I kill your brother first...

268
00:23:42,601 --> 00:23:44,226
before I kill you?

269
00:23:46,144 --> 00:23:49,645
Why don't you try
sticking your head up your ass?

270
00:23:50,145 --> 00:23:52,021
See if it fits.

271
00:23:53,773 --> 00:23:56,149
Yeah? Okay.

272
00:24:19,615 --> 00:24:22,742
<i>It's very important.
I understand.</i>

273
00:24:22,825 --> 00:24:24,450
<i>Thank you.
You're welcome.</i>

274
00:24:24,534 --> 00:24:26,493
<i>You forecasted an earthquake...</i>

275
00:24:26,576 --> 00:24:28,868
<i>in the 3-to-4-point range
this morning.</i>

276
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:32,204
<i>We had an earthquake
in the 3-to-4-point range.</i>

277
00:24:32,288 --> 00:24:34,330
<i>I'm impressed.
Thank you, sir.</i>

278
00:24:34,914 --> 00:24:37,790
<i>However, isn't it
rather slender evidence...</i>

279
00:24:48,877 --> 00:24:50,836
You have such beautiful skin.

280
00:24:54,087 --> 00:24:56,215
I like the way you...

281
00:24:59,132 --> 00:25:01,966
I don't know what I'm supposed
to do today, but...

282
00:25:25,101 --> 00:25:27,560
<i>Antonio, mira!</i>

283
00:25:28,768 --> 00:25:30,686
Watch what happens to your friend.

284
00:25:30,811 --> 00:25:32,854
If you don't want this
to happen to you...

285
00:25:32,938 --> 00:25:34,480
give me the money.

286
00:25:53,362 --> 00:25:54,738
Come on, come on.

287
00:26:06,033 --> 00:26:07,701
Now the leg.

288
00:26:20,498 --> 00:26:22,498
Let's do it, man. Come on.

289
00:26:28,126 --> 00:26:30,127
We're all gonna be all right.

290
00:26:41,256 --> 00:26:43,217
<i>Okay, cara cicatriz.</i>

291
00:26:43,967 --> 00:26:46,717
You can die, too.
It makes no difference to me.

292
00:26:52,929 --> 00:26:55,429
<i>Last chance, pendejo!</i>

293
00:26:56,096 --> 00:26:57,389
Fuck you!

294
00:28:05,541 --> 00:28:08,126
- You okay?
- Yeah, man. It went in and out.

295
00:28:19,505 --> 00:28:21,507
Okay, take him out of here, quick!

296
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,507
<i>Chi Chi! Get the yeyo.</i>

297
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,309
- Your turn.
- I kill you!

298
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:49,644
Die!

299
00:29:03,314 --> 00:29:06,942
Hurry up! Get in! Come on. Let's go!

300
00:29:07,401 --> 00:29:08,776
<i>Close the door!</i>

301
00:29:21,071 --> 00:29:24,658
Bunch of cowboys.
Somebody fucked up.

302
00:29:25,199 --> 00:29:27,367
<i>Yeah, well,
I'll check it out right away.</i>

303
00:29:27,492 --> 00:29:31,661
You do that, Omar. You do that.

304
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:34,495
<i>You still got the money?
Yeah.</i>

305
00:29:35,412 --> 00:29:37,453
<i>And I got the yeyo.</i>

306
00:29:38,121 --> 00:29:40,789
<i>You got the yeyo?
Yeah, right.</i>

307
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:43,331
<i>Bring it here.
Fuck you.</i>

308
00:29:43,415 --> 00:29:45,832
I'm taking it to Lopez myself.

309
00:29:47,082 --> 00:29:48,209
Not you, me.

310
00:30:07,091 --> 00:30:08,426
Nice fucking guy.

311
00:30:22,431 --> 00:30:24,558
Frank Lopez. Tony Montana.

312
00:30:24,641 --> 00:30:27,975
Tony Montana.
Mr. Lopez. It's a real pleasure.

313
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:29,392
You can call me Frank.

314
00:30:29,475 --> 00:30:32,101
<i>Everybody calls me Frank.
My Little League team.</i>

315
00:30:32,226 --> 00:30:34,769
Even the fucking prosecutors
around town...

316
00:30:34,852 --> 00:30:36,061
they all call me Frank.

317
00:30:36,144 --> 00:30:37,771
- Okay, Frank.
- How are you?

318
00:30:37,854 --> 00:30:39,813
Manny Ribera.

319
00:30:40,146 --> 00:30:42,565
- He caught one on the job.
- Went right through.

320
00:30:42,648 --> 00:30:44,274
We heard about that.

321
00:30:44,357 --> 00:30:47,525
Omar, he tells me great things
about you guys.

322
00:30:49,233 --> 00:30:50,900
Well, Omar's okay.

323
00:30:50,983 --> 00:30:54,194
Not to mention, of course,
the nice job you did for me.

324
00:30:54,277 --> 00:30:57,945
- That Commie son of a bitch...
- You don't have to mention that.

325
00:30:58,028 --> 00:31:01,029
- That was fun.
- That was fun?

326
00:31:01,112 --> 00:31:03,657
- Damn right.
- That was fun.

327
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,700
Sometimes it's fun.

328
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:10,659
What do you want to drink?
Scotch, gin, rum? What do you like?

329
00:31:10,742 --> 00:31:13,868
Gin is fine. Want some? Two gins.

330
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:17,286
I need a guy with steel
in his balls, Tony.

331
00:31:17,369 --> 00:31:20,871
A guy like you. And I need him
around me all the time.

332
00:31:20,996 --> 00:31:24,372
<i>You, Tony, and your compadre here.</i>

333
00:31:27,542 --> 00:31:28,959
Here's the stuff.

334
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:32,793
Two keys.

335
00:31:34,418 --> 00:31:37,837
It cost my friend Angel his life.
Here's the money.

336
00:31:39,212 --> 00:31:40,879
My gift to you.

337
00:31:46,424 --> 00:31:48,799
I'm sorry about your friend, Tony.

338
00:31:49,091 --> 00:31:51,134
If people would do business
the right way...

339
00:31:51,259 --> 00:31:53,844
there'd be no fuck-ups like this.

340
00:31:55,886 --> 00:31:58,470
Don't think
I don't appreciate the gesture.

341
00:31:58,636 --> 00:32:01,512
<i>You're gonna find,
you stay loyal in this business...</i>

342
00:32:01,637 --> 00:32:04,932
you're gonna move up.
You're gonna move up fast.

343
00:32:12,351 --> 00:32:14,309
And you'll find out
your biggest problem...

344
00:32:14,392 --> 00:32:16,353
is not bringing in the stuff...

345
00:32:16,436 --> 00:32:19,186
but what to do
with all the fucking cash!

346
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,189
I hope I have that problem someday.

347
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:24,106
You'll have that problem,
don't worry.

348
00:32:24,189 --> 00:32:26,148
Sit down over here.

349
00:32:28,357 --> 00:32:32,317
Where the hell's Elvira?
It's late. Go find her, will you?

350
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,318
Jesus! Fucking broad.

351
00:32:35,401 --> 00:32:39,571
She spends half her life dressing,
the other half undressing.

352
00:32:41,154 --> 00:32:43,239
Gotta get her in between.

353
00:32:43,948 --> 00:32:46,198
She's coming.
Yeah.

354
00:32:46,323 --> 00:32:49,033
You gotta jump on her
when she's not looking.

355
00:32:49,117 --> 00:32:51,033
That's the best time.

356
00:32:53,534 --> 00:32:55,577
What are you guys doing tonight?

357
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:58,786
You wanna go to a nice restaurant
with me? You hungry?

358
00:32:59,786 --> 00:33:00,954
I could eat a horse.

359
00:33:01,121 --> 00:33:04,123
- Okay, they'll cook you a horse.
- I'll eat it.

360
00:33:09,666 --> 00:33:12,416
Tell me, where'd they get you?
Right there in the side?

361
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,835
It's nothing.
It went right through me.

362
00:33:14,918 --> 00:33:15,960
It hit the wall.

363
00:33:16,043 --> 00:33:18,378
I ran out of bullets
like an asshole.

364
00:33:18,461 --> 00:33:21,879
<i>When I changed the clip,
a guy who I thought I killed...</i>

365
00:33:22,004 --> 00:33:24,131
<i>wasn't dead and shot me.</i>

366
00:33:24,756 --> 00:33:26,672
The guy was behind me. I killed him.

367
00:33:26,756 --> 00:33:29,174
- How many bullets you catch?
- Bullets? One bullet.

368
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:30,549
Nine millimeter.

369
00:33:41,263 --> 00:33:45,055
Elvira, where the hell you been?
It's 10:00. I'm starving.

370
00:33:45,139 --> 00:33:48,431
You're always hungry.
You should try starving.

371
00:33:49,474 --> 00:33:51,099
Where you going? Come on.

372
00:33:51,224 --> 00:33:55,559
<i>Come over here!
I want you to meet a friend of mine.</i>

373
00:33:58,061 --> 00:34:00,271
Tony Montana. Elvira.

374
00:34:02,522 --> 00:34:05,022
- Hello.
- Manny Ribera. Elvira.

375
00:34:05,188 --> 00:34:08,899
So, there are five of us.
Where are we having dinner?

376
00:34:08,982 --> 00:34:11,440
I thought we'd go
to the Babylon Club.

377
00:34:11,775 --> 00:34:13,525
- Again?
- Again.

378
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:16,944
You know, Frank, if anyone wanted
to assassinate you...

379
00:34:17,028 --> 00:34:19,237
you wouldn't be too hard to find.

380
00:34:19,362 --> 00:34:22,488
Assassinate me?
Who the hell would want to kill me?

381
00:34:24,614 --> 00:34:26,615
I got nothing but friends!

382
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:30,657
You never know. Maybe the catcher
on your Little League team.

383
00:34:31,241 --> 00:34:34,950
The catcher? That son of a bitch,
he didn't get a base hit all season.

384
00:34:35,034 --> 00:34:36,451
<i>I should kill him!</i>

385
00:35:43,353 --> 00:35:46,647
You know who that is?
Luis and Miguel Echevierra.

386
00:35:48,314 --> 00:35:51,606
They got the biggest distribution
set-up from here to Houston...

387
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:53,982
Tucson, all down that way.

388
00:35:54,107 --> 00:35:55,859
What do you think of that?

389
00:35:57,944 --> 00:35:58,985
Look.

390
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:04,613
<i>You see that fat bastard?
That's Nacho Contreras.</i>

391
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,697
<i>El Gordo!</i>

392
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,698
<i>He's got more cash
than anybody in this place.</i>

393
00:36:09,823 --> 00:36:12,365
<i>He's a real chazer!</i>

394
00:36:16,701 --> 00:36:19,161
<i>You know what a chazer is?</i>

395
00:36:19,494 --> 00:36:21,829
<i>No, Frank, you tell me.
What is a chazer?</i>

396
00:36:21,912 --> 00:36:24,455
It's the Yiddish word for "pig."

397
00:36:24,538 --> 00:36:29,373
A guy who wants more than he needs.
He don't fly straight no more.

398
00:36:29,457 --> 00:36:34,833
So, it comes down to one thing,
Tony boy, and you never forget it.

399
00:36:36,875 --> 00:36:38,961
Lesson Number 1:

400
00:36:40,502 --> 00:36:43,254
Don't underestimate...

401
00:36:43,338 --> 00:36:45,713
the other guy's greed!

402
00:36:47,255 --> 00:36:48,423
Lesson Number 2:

403
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:50,548
Don't get high on your own supply.

404
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:54,966
That's right. Lesson Number 2:
Don't get high on your own supply.

405
00:36:55,049 --> 00:36:57,593
'Course, not everybody
follows the rules.

406
00:37:03,136 --> 00:37:05,054
Your champagne, Mr. Lopez.

407
00:37:05,137 --> 00:37:07,848
That is '64?
The best, Mr. Lopez.

408
00:37:07,973 --> 00:37:11,389
Omar, you pour it, and you bring
another bottle right away, will you?

409
00:37:14,558 --> 00:37:18,727
$550 for this bottle, Tony.
What do you think of that?

410
00:37:18,852 --> 00:37:22,479
- That's pretty good.
- For a bunch of fucking grapes.

411
00:37:25,104 --> 00:37:29,146
So, here's to old friends
and to new friends.

412
00:37:38,235 --> 00:37:39,819
How you like it, Tony?

413
00:37:40,694 --> 00:37:42,612
- That's good, Frank.
- That's good?

414
00:37:42,695 --> 00:37:45,278
- Like you say, man.
- That's good!

415
00:37:48,488 --> 00:37:51,280
I'm gonna get you new clothes, too.

416
00:37:51,364 --> 00:37:54,282
I'm gonna get you $550 suits...

417
00:37:54,991 --> 00:37:56,826
so you look real sharp.

418
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,994
'Cause I want you to work for me.

419
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:05,536
I want you and your boys
to work with Omar here.

420
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,997
We are going to do...

421
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,623
something big next month.

422
00:38:12,998 --> 00:38:16,376
We are running a string of mules
from Colombia.

423
00:38:16,834 --> 00:38:20,376
You do good on that,
there'll be some other things.

424
00:38:22,336 --> 00:38:24,795
That sounds like fun to me, Frank.

425
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:28,505
You want a cigar?

426
00:38:31,631 --> 00:38:35,759
You wanna dance, Frank,
or sit here and have a heart attack?

427
00:38:40,426 --> 00:38:44,969
Who? Me, dance?
I want a heart attack instead.

428
00:38:47,263 --> 00:38:49,221
Don't foam into the Dommie P.

429
00:38:55,558 --> 00:38:56,767
How about you?

430
00:39:01,185 --> 00:39:03,144
What? You want me to dance?

431
00:39:03,227 --> 00:39:05,270
Yeah, sure. Go on, Tony. You dance.

432
00:39:05,561 --> 00:39:08,478
Go on. Have some fun.

433
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,193
What do you think of him?

434
00:39:23,485 --> 00:39:25,569
I think he's a fucking peasant!

435
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:32,614
But you get a guy like that
on your side...

436
00:39:33,156 --> 00:39:35,409
he breaks his back for you.

437
00:40:04,503 --> 00:40:06,628
- What's your name?
- What?

438
00:40:07,836 --> 00:40:10,462
What's your name? Elvira what?

439
00:40:10,629 --> 00:40:12,881
- Hancock.
- What?

440
00:40:13,131 --> 00:40:15,590
- Hancock!
- Hancock?

441
00:40:17,215 --> 00:40:20,217
Sounds like a bird. Hancock.

442
00:40:20,592 --> 00:40:22,051
Flying around.

443
00:40:24,303 --> 00:40:25,553
Where you from?

444
00:40:26,386 --> 00:40:28,513
- Baltimore.
- What?

445
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,514
- Baltimore!
- Baltimore?

446
00:40:31,014 --> 00:40:34,765
- Where's that?
- It doesn't really matter, okay?

447
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:38,475
I'm just trying to be friendly.

448
00:40:38,642 --> 00:40:40,850
I don't need another friend...

449
00:40:40,934 --> 00:40:43,226
especially one
who just got off a banana boat.

450
00:40:44,851 --> 00:40:46,561
Banana boat?

451
00:40:46,769 --> 00:40:50,397
Hold it. You got the wrong guy.
I don't come off no banana boat.

452
00:40:52,147 --> 00:40:54,481
<i>You're thinking of someone else,
maybe.</i>

453
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:57,066
Aren't you part
of the Cuban crime wave?

454
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:01,483
What you talking crazy for?
I'm a political refugee here.

455
00:41:01,775 --> 00:41:04,610
So take it easy. Don't talk crazy.
Sorry.

456
00:41:04,985 --> 00:41:08,195
I didn't know you were so sensitive
about your diplomatic status.

457
00:41:08,278 --> 00:41:11,071
What is your problem, baby?

458
00:41:11,237 --> 00:41:12,406
<i>You're good-looking.</i>

459
00:41:12,489 --> 00:41:14,574
<i>You got a beautiful body,
beautiful legs...</i>

460
00:41:14,657 --> 00:41:17,158
a beautiful face,
all these guys in love with you.

461
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:18,741
Only you got a look in your eye...

462
00:41:18,866 --> 00:41:21,533
like you haven't been fucked
in a year!

463
00:41:22,452 --> 00:41:24,077
Hey, José.

464
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,453
Who, why, when and how I fuck
is none of your business, okay?

465
00:41:27,536 --> 00:41:30,788
Now you're talking to me, baby.
That I like. Keep it coming.

466
00:41:30,871 --> 00:41:33,997
Don't call me "baby"!
I'm not your baby.

467
00:41:34,706 --> 00:41:37,249
Not yet,
but you gotta give me some time.

468
00:41:39,667 --> 00:41:42,876
Even if I were blind, desperate...

469
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,335
starved and begging for it
on a desert island...

470
00:41:45,418 --> 00:41:47,752
you'd be the last thing
I'd ever fuck.

471
00:41:51,297 --> 00:41:53,047
That chick he's with...

472
00:41:53,755 --> 00:41:55,339
Yeah?
She likes me.

473
00:41:57,090 --> 00:42:00,466
She likes you? How do you know?

474
00:42:00,759 --> 00:42:01,968
I know.

475
00:42:03,384 --> 00:42:06,553
<i>The eyes, chico. They never lie.</i>

476
00:42:10,012 --> 00:42:13,888
- Are you serious?
- Serious? What do you think?

477
00:42:14,097 --> 00:42:16,515
That's the boss's lady, okay?

478
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:20,891
- You're gonna get us killed.
- Fuck you, man. The boss's lady.

479
00:42:21,975 --> 00:42:23,641
That guy's soft.

480
00:42:25,769 --> 00:42:27,228
Look in his face.

481
00:42:30,188 --> 00:42:32,897
<i>The booze and the concha
tell him what to do.</i>

482
00:42:35,565 --> 00:42:37,857
Don't fucking go crazy on me, okay?

483
00:42:38,815 --> 00:42:42,692
Just remember last year at this time
we were in a fucking cage, okay?

484
00:42:42,775 --> 00:42:44,109
You remember.

485
00:42:45,151 --> 00:42:46,943
I'd like to forget that.

486
00:42:47,736 --> 00:42:51,239
- I say be happy with what you got.
- You be happy.

487
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:56,156
- Me, I want what's coming to me.
- What's coming to you?

488
00:42:58,781 --> 00:43:00,742
<i>The world, chico...</i>

489
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,117
and everything in it.

490
00:43:10,329 --> 00:43:14,998
THREE MONTHS LATER

491
00:43:39,758 --> 00:43:41,341
This is paradise.

492
00:43:42,799 --> 00:43:45,093
This is paradise, I'm telling you.

493
00:43:45,385 --> 00:43:49,803
This town's like a great big pussy
just waiting to get fucked.

494
00:43:51,303 --> 00:43:53,764
I should've come here 10 years ago.

495
00:43:53,847 --> 00:43:56,680
I'd have been a millionaire
by this time.

496
00:43:57,805 --> 00:44:00,681
By this time,
I'd have had my own boat...

497
00:44:00,765 --> 00:44:03,184
my own car, my own golf course.

498
00:44:03,268 --> 00:44:06,227
You know what I want?
I thought of this the other day.

499
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:07,936
A line of blue jeans.

500
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:11,271
With my name written
on the back of chicks' asses.

501
00:44:12,813 --> 00:44:13,980
How's that?

502
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:17,105
That sounds completely crazy to me.

503
00:44:18,773 --> 00:44:20,274
Look at that. Look.

504
00:44:20,399 --> 00:44:22,983
<i>You're missing the sights.
That's what you're doing.</i>

505
00:44:23,066 --> 00:44:25,109
<i>We're missing the action.</i>

506
00:44:27,486 --> 00:44:30,029
Want to have some ice cream
with my friend and me?

507
00:44:30,112 --> 00:44:31,862
Get lost, greaseball!

508
00:44:32,988 --> 00:44:34,738
- Look at that.
- Ice cream?

509
00:44:34,821 --> 00:44:36,571
- That's right.
- You said "ice cream"?

510
00:44:36,655 --> 00:44:39,865
- Girls like ice cream.
- Come on. That won't work.

511
00:44:39,948 --> 00:44:41,908
You can't do it that way.

512
00:44:41,991 --> 00:44:44,909
You know how you pick up chicks
in this country?

513
00:44:48,911 --> 00:44:52,246
- What was that? What you just did?
- That's what you do.

514
00:44:53,121 --> 00:44:55,164
- That's disgusting.
- Watch.

515
00:44:55,289 --> 00:44:58,123
Look at that fucking thing.
You look like a lizard.

516
00:44:58,206 --> 00:45:00,415
Like a bug coming out of your mouth.

517
00:45:01,373 --> 00:45:03,499
Figures you wouldn't understand.

518
00:45:03,666 --> 00:45:06,835
But the women in this country,
when you do that, they know.

519
00:45:06,919 --> 00:45:09,877
- They know what?
- They understand. They go crazy.

520
00:45:10,919 --> 00:45:13,337
It'll take practice,
but you gotta learn.

521
00:45:13,421 --> 00:45:15,587
'Cause women love
when you suck the pussy.

522
00:45:15,712 --> 00:45:16,964
Look at that.

523
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:24,176
She's looking at us.

524
00:45:27,052 --> 00:45:30,553
- You think you can do it with her?
- I think I can.

525
00:45:30,678 --> 00:45:33,429
- You want to try it with her?
- Why not?

526
00:45:34,595 --> 00:45:37,971
- You gonna watch me?
- I'm looking at you. Go ahead.

527
00:45:38,096 --> 00:45:39,681
- You won't do it.
- Watch this.

528
00:45:41,058 --> 00:45:42,558
I'm with you, man.

529
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:44,725
I'm gonna get her.

530
00:45:47,685 --> 00:45:49,977
Go ahead, Romeo! Do your thing.

531
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,937
- Just be quiet. Just hang back.
- Romeo!

532
00:45:58,605 --> 00:46:02,524
You're looking very pretty today.
Yes, you. I've been watching you.

533
00:46:02,857 --> 00:46:04,774
You want to see something funny?

534
00:46:04,857 --> 00:46:06,985
Take a look over there.
See that man?

535
00:46:07,152 --> 00:46:09,485
<i>Watch that guy.
I gotta sit down here.</i>

536
00:46:09,735 --> 00:46:10,861
I gotta watch my friend.

537
00:46:10,945 --> 00:46:13,611
He gonna stick his tongue out
to that girl.

538
00:46:13,736 --> 00:46:15,155
Look at that.

539
00:46:16,155 --> 00:46:17,280
You're sick!

540
00:46:17,363 --> 00:46:19,573
You see what happened to him?

541
00:46:19,948 --> 00:46:23,615
- If I wasn't a nice guy...
- She's too big for you.

542
00:46:23,991 --> 00:46:25,659
Causing trouble like that, come on.

543
00:46:25,742 --> 00:46:28,201
- Bitch! Lesbian!
- What I try to tell you?

544
00:46:28,284 --> 00:46:29,703
What I try to tell you?

545
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:32,704
This country,
you gotta make the money first.

546
00:46:33,954 --> 00:46:36,913
Then when you get the money,
you get the power.

547
00:46:36,996 --> 00:46:40,206
Then when you get the power,
then you get the women.

548
00:46:41,081 --> 00:46:43,083
That's why you gotta
make your own moves.

549
00:46:43,166 --> 00:46:44,875
That's the one I rented.

550
00:46:45,542 --> 00:46:49,126
No. That's her, man. There she is.

551
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:50,836
<i>About time.</i>

552
00:46:51,919 --> 00:46:54,254
Frank got held up
at the golf course.

553
00:46:54,296 --> 00:46:55,879
He told me to pick you up.

554
00:46:56,546 --> 00:46:59,130
<i>He said he'd meet us
at the track later.</i>

555
00:47:02,132 --> 00:47:05,425
He said to bet on Ice Cream
in the first, by the way.

556
00:47:07,508 --> 00:47:10,260
In that thing? You must be kidding.

557
00:47:11,969 --> 00:47:15,095
What you talking about?
That's a Cadillac.

558
00:47:16,886 --> 00:47:20,014
- I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
- Come on.

559
00:47:20,765 --> 00:47:25,433
It's got a few years,
but it's a cream puff.

560
00:47:26,434 --> 00:47:28,602
It looks like somebody's nightmare.

561
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,481
So, you like this better?

562
00:47:43,108 --> 00:47:47,860
It's like one of them tigers
from India.

563
00:47:48,026 --> 00:47:49,985
Crazy guy.
Know what he's been doing?

564
00:47:50,068 --> 00:47:52,903
Dragging me to the zoo
to look at tigers.

565
00:47:53,112 --> 00:47:54,695
He says he's gonna buy one.

566
00:47:54,778 --> 00:47:57,363
<i>You do that
and you won't have any friends left.</i>

567
00:47:57,446 --> 00:48:00,655
Not that you have any now.
You'll like that tiger, man.

568
00:48:00,739 --> 00:48:03,657
You gonna drive around with a tiger
in your passenger seat?

569
00:48:03,741 --> 00:48:06,199
Maybe. Some lady tiger.

570
00:48:09,618 --> 00:48:12,411
- How much?
- $43,000, fully equipped.

571
00:48:12,453 --> 00:48:15,911
- That all?
- Machine-gun turrets are extra.

572
00:48:16,078 --> 00:48:19,079
He's a funny guy. Come here, Manny.

573
00:48:20,956 --> 00:48:23,415
Bullet-proof this, okay?

574
00:48:23,499 --> 00:48:25,582
And this here and here.

575
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:28,041
<i>And the windows.</i>

576
00:48:30,584 --> 00:48:35,128
- Get me a phone with a scrambler.
- A scrambler.

577
00:48:35,294 --> 00:48:37,713
And a radio with scanners...

578
00:48:37,796 --> 00:48:39,797
to pick up flying saucers,
stuff like that.

579
00:48:39,881 --> 00:48:41,548
Don't forget the fog lights.

580
00:48:41,632 --> 00:48:45,590
In case I get caught in a swamp.
That's a good idea.

581
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:51,676
Get out of the way, lady!
I'm trying to drive here!

582
00:48:53,093 --> 00:48:55,469
I thought you were taking me
to Frank.

583
00:49:01,056 --> 00:49:03,556
We got an hour. You hungry?

584
00:49:05,307 --> 00:49:07,058
No, but I'm bored.

585
00:49:08,142 --> 00:49:09,767
Well, that figures.

586
00:49:11,934 --> 00:49:15,227
Check it out, Manny, okay?
And pay the guy.

587
00:49:15,561 --> 00:49:18,729
And you take a taxi.
Meet me at the track, okay?

588
00:49:18,896 --> 00:49:20,606
Good doing business with you.

589
00:49:26,025 --> 00:49:28,400
I wouldn't buy the car
if you didn't like it.

590
00:49:28,525 --> 00:49:31,318
Planning on driving the girls crazy,
aren't you, Tony?

591
00:49:31,402 --> 00:49:33,652
Yeah. You know who?

592
00:49:35,778 --> 00:49:37,529
What would Frank say?

593
00:49:39,947 --> 00:49:41,614
I like Frank, you know?

594
00:49:42,156 --> 00:49:43,989
Only I like you better.

595
00:49:51,868 --> 00:49:54,201
- You got some for me?
- Sure.

596
00:50:12,418 --> 00:50:17,254
Don't get confused, Tony.
I don't fuck around with the help.

597
00:50:24,799 --> 00:50:28,632
You wanna play that way with me,
I play with you.

598
00:50:28,758 --> 00:50:29,925
Shit.

599
00:50:30,591 --> 00:50:32,341
Would you kiss me if I wear the hat?

600
00:50:32,425 --> 00:50:33,509
No!

601
00:50:35,761 --> 00:50:37,970
Playtime is over, okay?

602
00:51:35,203 --> 00:51:36,494
Mama?

603
00:51:39,829 --> 00:51:41,079
Long time.

604
00:51:43,914 --> 00:51:45,664
No postcards from jail?

605
00:51:56,502 --> 00:51:57,628
Gina.

606
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:02,297
- Tony?
- Look at you.

607
00:52:04,172 --> 00:52:05,714
You're beautiful.

608
00:52:06,423 --> 00:52:09,173
- I didn't...
- Mama, look at those eyes.

609
00:52:09,423 --> 00:52:11,634
Look at that. She looks like me.

610
00:52:12,384 --> 00:52:15,260
You know the last time I saw you,
you was like that.

611
00:52:15,385 --> 00:52:18,886
You looked like a little boy.
Now look at you.

612
00:52:23,263 --> 00:52:25,138
I got something for you.

613
00:52:30,224 --> 00:52:32,058
It's no big deal.

614
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:48,982
I never thought I'd see you again,
you know?

615
00:52:49,107 --> 00:52:51,233
You think they'd keep
a guy like me down?

616
00:52:51,316 --> 00:52:52,859
Well, no.

617
00:52:57,069 --> 00:53:02,071
- You look so good.
- Look, open that up. Open it.

618
00:53:02,738 --> 00:53:05,031
- For me?
- I think so.

619
00:53:06,281 --> 00:53:09,615
It's nothing much,
you know, nothing.

620
00:53:14,576 --> 00:53:16,077
See what's written on the back?

621
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,535
On the back?

622
00:53:19,410 --> 00:53:23,287
- Always.
- "Always." It's beautiful, Tony!

623
00:53:24,873 --> 00:53:26,998
Mama is still working
in the factory...

624
00:53:27,081 --> 00:53:29,206
and I work part-time
in a beauty parlor.

625
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:32,376
I'm doing hair, Tony.
Do you remember Hiram Gonzalez?

626
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:35,377
His father owned that barbershop.
It's his place.

627
00:53:35,502 --> 00:53:38,085
Plus I go to junior college.
Miami Dade.

628
00:53:38,252 --> 00:53:41,295
In two more years,
I get my cosmetology license.

629
00:53:41,379 --> 00:53:44,713
- Then I'll be making enough money...
- Surprise!

630
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:48,047
All that's over, starting today.

631
00:53:48,422 --> 00:53:49,466
Why?

632
00:53:49,591 --> 00:53:54,218
My kid sister don't have to work
in no beauty parlor, and Mama...

633
00:53:54,885 --> 00:53:57,261
she don't have to sew in no factory.

634
00:53:57,552 --> 00:53:59,720
Your son made it, Mama.

635
00:54:01,137 --> 00:54:02,428
He's a success.

636
00:54:03,595 --> 00:54:06,014
That's why
I didn't come around before.

637
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:10,890
I want you to see
what a good boy I've been.

638
00:54:13,266 --> 00:54:14,769
Here's $1,000.

639
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:17,019
For you, Mama.

640
00:54:24,855 --> 00:54:27,063
Who did you kill for this, Antonio?

641
00:54:27,938 --> 00:54:29,814
I didn't kill nobody, Mama.

642
00:54:30,815 --> 00:54:31,940
No?
No.

643
00:54:32,984 --> 00:54:34,942
What are you doing now?

644
00:54:35,484 --> 00:54:38,569
<i>Banks, or is it still bodegas,
you and the others?</i>

645
00:54:38,653 --> 00:54:40,903
No! Things are different now.

646
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:43,821
I'm working
with an anti-Castro group.

647
00:54:44,238 --> 00:54:45,821
I'm an organizer now.

648
00:54:45,905 --> 00:54:48,197
I get a lot
of political contributions.

649
00:54:49,239 --> 00:54:50,699
Sure you do.

650
00:54:55,159 --> 00:54:58,243
A gun sticking in somebody's face
is how.

651
00:54:59,869 --> 00:55:02,871
You know, all we hear about
in the papers...

652
00:55:04,704 --> 00:55:07,664
is animals like you
and the killings.

653
00:55:08,415 --> 00:55:11,666
It's Cubans like you who are giving
a bad name to our people.

654
00:55:11,749 --> 00:55:15,083
People who come here, work hard
and make a good name for themselves.

655
00:55:15,167 --> 00:55:17,127
People who send their children
to school.

656
00:55:17,252 --> 00:55:18,919
What are you saying?
That's your son...

657
00:55:19,002 --> 00:55:22,086
Son? I wish I had one.

658
00:55:22,961 --> 00:55:23,961
He's a bum.

659
00:55:24,086 --> 00:55:26,923
He was a bum then
and he's a bum now.

660
00:55:28,923 --> 00:55:30,715
Who do you think you are?

661
00:55:33,258 --> 00:55:36,176
We haven't heard a word
from you in five years.

662
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:41,969
You suddenly show up here,
throw some money around...

663
00:55:42,053 --> 00:55:44,554
and think you can get my respect.

664
00:55:45,095 --> 00:55:47,888
You think you can buy me
with jewellery?

665
00:55:47,971 --> 00:55:51,558
You think you can come into my house
with your hotshot clothes...

666
00:55:51,641 --> 00:55:54,100
and your jail manners
and make fun of us?

667
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:58,351
- You don't know what you're saying.
- That's not the way I am, Antonio!

668
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:01,061
That is not the way
I raised Gina to be!

669
00:56:03,187 --> 00:56:05,687
You are not going to destroy her.

670
00:56:07,313 --> 00:56:09,064
I don't need your money.

671
00:56:11,149 --> 00:56:12,982
I work for my living.

672
00:56:13,524 --> 00:56:16,109
I don't want you
in this house anymore!

673
00:56:16,568 --> 00:56:18,526
I don't want you around Gina.

674
00:56:19,444 --> 00:56:22,195
So come on. Get out!

675
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:37,742
And take this lousy money with you.
It stinks.

676
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:43,578
Why do you have to spoil it
for everybody?

677
00:56:46,246 --> 00:56:47,872
<i>I'm sorry, Tony.</i>

678
00:56:49,622 --> 00:56:51,040
Okay, Mama.

679
00:56:55,334 --> 00:56:56,792
No. Tony, wait a minute!

680
00:56:56,875 --> 00:56:59,084
Don't go, please!
Gina, stay here!

681
00:56:59,334 --> 00:57:01,460
No, Mama.
He's no good. Gina!

682
00:57:02,751 --> 00:57:04,588
Tony, wait, please!

683
00:57:05,254 --> 00:57:09,673
I'm sorry. I don't know.
Mama, ever since Papa left she's...

684
00:57:09,756 --> 00:57:11,881
Forget Papa. We never had one.

685
00:57:12,131 --> 00:57:14,633
I know you did some bad things
back then.

686
00:57:14,883 --> 00:57:17,592
In the Army,
I know you got into some trouble.

687
00:57:17,717 --> 00:57:19,468
The Communists...

688
00:57:19,551 --> 00:57:21,635
they're always trying
to tell you what to do.

689
00:57:21,719 --> 00:57:24,553
- Mama doesn't understand that.
- I know.

690
00:57:26,136 --> 00:57:28,762
I just... I don't know.

691
00:57:28,848 --> 00:57:31,432
I just want you to know
that I don't care.

692
00:57:31,724 --> 00:57:35,600
<i>It doesn't matter to me how long
you've been away, five or ten years.</i>

693
00:57:37,683 --> 00:57:40,893
You're my blood, always.

694
00:57:42,102 --> 00:57:43,227
I know.

695
00:57:53,774 --> 00:57:56,984
- Come on. I want you to take this.
- I gotta go back in.

696
00:57:57,067 --> 00:57:59,735
- No, Tony. Please.
- You need this.

697
00:57:59,818 --> 00:58:01,151
What will I tell her?

698
00:58:01,235 --> 00:58:02,985
Take that.
You don't tell her anything.

699
00:58:03,069 --> 00:58:06,613
Don't tell her I gave it to you,
but give her some from time to time.

700
00:58:06,738 --> 00:58:09,322
And listen, you go out yourself.

701
00:58:09,405 --> 00:58:12,865
Go ahead, go out, do some things.
Have some fun.

702
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:15,157
You gotta get some fun out of life.

703
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:18,118
You gonna beat yourself to death
at 19?

704
00:58:18,201 --> 00:58:20,701
A pussycat like you? Come here.

705
00:58:25,121 --> 00:58:26,996
- I'll talk to you again.
- Okay.

706
00:58:27,079 --> 00:58:29,205
Put that money away.
Don't let her see it.

707
00:58:29,288 --> 00:58:30,788
I'll talk to her.

708
00:58:32,749 --> 00:58:34,124
I'll talk to you.

709
00:58:36,249 --> 00:58:37,333
Let's go.

710
00:58:39,333 --> 00:58:41,667
She's beautiful. How come you...

711
00:58:44,419 --> 00:58:48,421
Stay away from her. You hear?

712
00:58:49,255 --> 00:58:50,547
She's not for you.

713
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:05,052
COCHABAMBA, BOLIVIA

714
00:59:17,433 --> 00:59:20,517
So, this and my other factory,
I can guarantee production...

715
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:24,685
of 200 kilos refined
every month of the year.

716
00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:27,396
The problem is,
I have no steady market.

717
00:59:27,479 --> 00:59:30,896
Basically, what I'm looking for
is somebody in the States...

718
00:59:30,981 --> 00:59:34,315
who can share the risk with me,
somebody who can guarantee...

719
00:59:34,399 --> 00:59:38,608
to buy from me, say,
150 kilos a month.

720
00:59:40,066 --> 00:59:43,361
That's a big commitment, Mr. Sosa.
Something like that...

721
00:59:44,444 --> 00:59:46,737
Too bad Frank's not here.
You should talk to him.

722
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:49,904
- It would've been nice if he'd come.
- He would like to come...

723
00:59:49,987 --> 00:59:54,614
but with his trial coming up,
it's hard to leave the country.

724
00:59:54,697 --> 00:59:58,116
- So he sent you instead?
- Something like that.

725
00:59:58,199 --> 01:00:00,450
We'll talk at my house, shall we?

726
01:00:01,076 --> 01:00:04,494
You got good stuff here.
Class-A shit.

727
01:00:26,336 --> 01:00:30,088
This Lopez guarantees
to buy 150 kilos from me...

728
01:00:30,172 --> 01:00:31,422
every month of the year.

729
01:00:31,547 --> 01:00:32,755
He picks it up here.

730
01:00:32,838 --> 01:00:35,089
I can sell it to him
for as little as...

731
01:00:37,007 --> 01:00:40,466
$7,000 a key.
You can't do better than that.

732
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:44,134
But then we got to take the risk
of moving it.

733
01:00:44,344 --> 01:00:47,304
We'll be cutting out the Colombians.
Know what that means?

734
01:00:47,387 --> 01:00:49,305
That means we have
to go to war with them.

735
01:00:49,388 --> 01:00:52,555
We cut out the Colombians,
we take risks on both sides.

736
01:00:53,096 --> 01:00:54,973
Why don't we split the risk?

737
01:00:56,640 --> 01:01:00,183
You guarantee your delivery,
say, as far as Panama...

738
01:01:01,016 --> 01:01:02,725
we take it from there.

739
01:01:05,102 --> 01:01:08,477
Panama is risky. It costs me more.

740
01:01:10,188 --> 01:01:14,398
Panama I can sell for $13,500 a key.

741
01:01:15,648 --> 01:01:18,231
$13,500? What, are you nuts?

742
01:01:19,774 --> 01:01:23,444
$13,500? We still
got to take that shit to Florida.

743
01:01:23,527 --> 01:01:25,652
<i>Do you know
what that's like these days?</i>

744
01:01:25,735 --> 01:01:27,777
You got the Navy everywhere.

745
01:01:27,944 --> 01:01:32,321
You got frogmen. You got EC-2s
with the satellite-tracking shit.

746
01:01:32,946 --> 01:01:36,239
You got the fucking Bell 209
assault choppers up the ass.

747
01:01:36,698 --> 01:01:39,200
We're losing one
out of every nine loads.

748
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:43,077
That's no duckwalk anymore,
let me tell you.

749
01:01:43,327 --> 01:01:44,743
Forget about $13,500.

750
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:51,037
What do you suggest
that is reasonable?

751
01:01:56,622 --> 01:01:58,666
Excuse me. One moment.

752
01:02:03,126 --> 01:02:05,461
What the fuck's the matter with you?

753
01:02:05,544 --> 01:02:07,211
Are you negotiating for Frank Lopez?

754
01:02:07,295 --> 01:02:09,545
Don't worry about it. Take it easy.

755
01:02:09,670 --> 01:02:12,671
I'm not worried about it.
You should worry about it.

756
01:02:13,254 --> 01:02:16,089
If he wants to make a deal,
it's up to him, not you.

757
01:02:16,172 --> 01:02:17,798
We're doing this one deal.
That's it.

758
01:02:17,881 --> 01:02:19,799
Fuck you. How's that?

759
01:02:20,966 --> 01:02:22,676
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

760
01:02:22,801 --> 01:02:25,552
You need to open your eyes
and keep your mouth shut.

761
01:02:25,635 --> 01:02:28,553
That's it. Let it go at that.
Don't worry about it.

762
01:02:28,636 --> 01:02:31,930
Your head's in the wrong place.
You must watch out for yourself.

763
01:02:32,013 --> 01:02:33,222
<i>Why not talk to him?</i>

764
01:02:33,305 --> 01:02:35,263
<i>You think he wants
to give you the money?</i>

765
01:02:35,347 --> 01:02:36,806
Shut the fuck up.

766
01:02:36,889 --> 01:02:38,973
I'm doing the talking here, not you.

767
01:02:39,849 --> 01:02:42,434
You're here to watch my back.
Watch my back.

768
01:02:43,892 --> 01:02:45,892
Better than your front,
let me tell you.

769
01:02:45,976 --> 01:02:47,394
<i>That's easier to watch.</i>

770
01:02:47,478 --> 01:02:48,936
Close your mouth.

771
01:02:49,269 --> 01:02:52,521
I can't wait to see what Frank's
gonna react to this one.

772
01:02:53,146 --> 01:02:55,730
Just shut up.
I'm doing the talking here.

773
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:59,441
Now where were we?
Panama.

774
01:02:59,899 --> 01:03:02,150
You're looking for a partner, right?

775
01:03:03,525 --> 01:03:05,067
Something like that.

776
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:08,652
Look, Mr. Sosa,
we're getting ahead of ourselves.

777
01:03:09,319 --> 01:03:13,529
I am down on Frank's authority
to buy 200 keys, that's it.

778
01:03:13,779 --> 01:03:16,114
That's my limit. I got no right.

779
01:03:16,197 --> 01:03:19,282
- Nobody got no right to negotiate...
- Let the man finish, okay?

780
01:03:19,366 --> 01:03:22,075
Let him propose a proposition,
then we can talk more.

781
01:03:22,158 --> 01:03:24,158
You got no authority here.

782
01:03:24,242 --> 01:03:27,035
I started you in this business,
so shut the fuck up.

783
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:31,078
- Frank is gonna love it.
- That's up to Frank, not you!

784
01:03:34,662 --> 01:03:36,706
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Sosa.

785
01:03:37,206 --> 01:03:38,707
No, it is all right.

786
01:03:39,290 --> 01:03:42,500
You're right.
Maybe you should talk to Frank.

787
01:03:45,418 --> 01:03:46,502
Well, good.

788
01:03:47,835 --> 01:03:50,961
I don't think it's something
I want to do on an overseas phone.

789
01:03:51,294 --> 01:03:56,213
But as soon as I get back to Miami,
I will talk to Frank personally.

790
01:03:57,339 --> 01:03:58,381
Good.

791
01:03:59,131 --> 01:04:01,550
My associates can escort you
to my chopper...

792
01:04:01,634 --> 01:04:03,342
<i>to take you to Santa Cruz.</i>

793
01:04:03,425 --> 01:04:06,510
<i>I have a jet there.
You'll be in Miami in five hours.</i>

794
01:04:06,593 --> 01:04:09,594
You'll be back here tomorrow
in time for lunch.

795
01:04:11,178 --> 01:04:12,262
Good.

796
01:04:16,096 --> 01:04:17,722
Good talking to you.

797
01:04:18,765 --> 01:04:20,891
Why not leave your friend here?

798
01:04:20,974 --> 01:04:23,766
While you're gone, he can tell me
how to run my business.

799
01:04:23,849 --> 01:04:26,934
- I think Frank wants to see him.
- No, that's okay.

800
01:04:27,018 --> 01:04:30,686
You tell Frank I'm keeping this guy
on ice for him.

801
01:04:33,436 --> 01:04:34,979
I guess so.

802
01:04:38,231 --> 01:04:40,065
Let's finish our lunch.

803
01:04:44,608 --> 01:04:46,817
I have to hand it to you, Mr. Sosa.

804
01:04:48,151 --> 01:04:50,403
You got everything a man could want.

805
01:04:52,361 --> 01:04:55,196
I like you, Tony.
There is no lying in you.

806
01:04:56,781 --> 01:05:00,948
Unfortunately, I don't feel the same
about the rest of your organization.

807
01:05:04,492 --> 01:05:06,659
What do you mean by that, Mr. Sosa?

808
01:05:07,367 --> 01:05:09,785
I'm talking about Omar Suarez.

809
01:05:12,494 --> 01:05:16,039
This garbage was recognized
by my associate at lunch...

810
01:05:16,997 --> 01:05:19,331
<i>from several years ago in New York.</i>

811
01:05:23,625 --> 01:05:25,750
He was an informer for the police.

812
01:05:43,633 --> 01:05:47,885
He put Vito Duval and Nello
and Gino Ramos away for life.

813
01:05:52,511 --> 01:05:55,345
<i>So how do I know
you're not a chivato, too, Tony?</i>

814
01:06:02,391 --> 01:06:04,641
Let's get this straight now.

815
01:06:06,350 --> 01:06:10,518
I've never fucked anybody over
who didn't have it coming.

816
01:06:10,768 --> 01:06:12,144
You got that?

817
01:06:13,102 --> 01:06:16,897
All I have in this world
is my balls and my word.

818
01:06:17,022 --> 01:06:20,439
I don't break them for no one,
you understand?

819
01:06:21,565 --> 01:06:24,149
That piece of shit up there,
I never liked him...

820
01:06:24,232 --> 01:06:25,774
I never trusted him.

821
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:27,984
For all I know, he had me set up...

822
01:06:28,068 --> 01:06:30,443
and had my friend
Angel Fernandez killed.

823
01:06:30,526 --> 01:06:32,945
But that's history.
I'm here, he's not.

824
01:06:33,028 --> 01:06:35,446
You want to go on with me, say it.

825
01:06:35,529 --> 01:06:38,238
You don't, then you make a move.

826
01:06:43,865 --> 01:06:46,575
I think you speak from the heart,
Montana.

827
01:06:46,658 --> 01:06:48,033
<i>But I say to myself...</i>

828
01:06:49,116 --> 01:06:51,119
this Lopez, your boss...

829
01:06:52,203 --> 01:06:55,079
<i>he had chivatos like that
working for him.</i>

830
01:06:55,996 --> 01:06:57,621
His judgment stinks.

831
01:07:00,122 --> 01:07:02,123
So I think to myself...

832
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:05,541
how many other mistakes
has this Lopez guy made?

833
01:07:07,959 --> 01:07:11,918
How can I trust his organization?
You tell me, Tony.

834
01:07:14,252 --> 01:07:17,130
Frank is smart, you know?

835
01:07:19,589 --> 01:07:21,881
You can't blame him for that animal.

836
01:07:23,090 --> 01:07:25,883
It's a crazy business we're in,
you know?

837
01:07:25,967 --> 01:07:28,633
That could happen to anyone,
even you.

838
01:07:35,137 --> 01:07:38,012
Why don't I go back
and talk to Frank...

839
01:07:39,012 --> 01:07:40,473
and work it out?

840
01:07:41,348 --> 01:07:43,307
I'll fix things between us.

841
01:07:45,266 --> 01:07:46,850
You got my word on that.

842
01:07:48,516 --> 01:07:51,392
I think you and me,
we can work this thing out...

843
01:07:52,019 --> 01:07:54,437
we do business together
for a long time.

844
01:07:56,437 --> 01:07:57,729
Just remember...

845
01:07:58,770 --> 01:08:00,897
I'll only tell you one time...

846
01:08:02,189 --> 01:08:04,108
don't fuck me, Tony.

847
01:08:06,733 --> 01:08:08,733
Don't you ever try to fuck me.

848
01:08:22,572 --> 01:08:23,823
You what?

849
01:08:26,031 --> 01:08:29,576
You made a deal
for fucking $18 million...

850
01:08:29,659 --> 01:08:30,994
without even checking with me?

851
01:08:31,077 --> 01:08:33,119
Are you crazy, Montana?
Are you crazy?

852
01:08:33,245 --> 01:08:35,036
<i>- Coño. Take it easy.
- Coño, my ass!</i>

853
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:38,247
<i>At $10,500 a key. It's puro.</i>

854
01:08:39,788 --> 01:08:42,122
You can't lose money. No way.

855
01:08:44,123 --> 01:08:47,665
We make $75 million on this deal.

856
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:50,709
$75 million.

857
01:08:51,917 --> 01:08:53,753
That is serious money.

858
01:08:54,045 --> 01:08:55,879
What is Sosa going to do...

859
01:08:55,962 --> 01:08:58,255
when I don't come up
with the first $5 million?

860
01:08:58,338 --> 01:09:01,130
What is he going to do?
Will he send me a bill?

861
01:09:01,171 --> 01:09:04,632
He'll send a hit squad up here!
There'll be a war in the street.

862
01:09:04,715 --> 01:09:08,466
Relax! Take it easy.
I'm in tight with Sosa.

863
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:13,427
You short a couple of million,
I go on the street for you.

864
01:09:13,636 --> 01:09:15,469
I make a couple of moves...

865
01:09:16,177 --> 01:09:18,554
a million here, a million there,
you got it.

866
01:09:24,348 --> 01:09:26,640
You've been making moves
on your own?

867
01:09:28,891 --> 01:09:31,894
I got ears, you know? I hear things.

868
01:09:35,644 --> 01:09:38,646
What do you hear about Echevierra
and the Diaz brothers?

869
01:09:38,729 --> 01:09:40,979
<i>What about Gomez?</i>

870
01:09:41,062 --> 01:09:43,356
<i>What'll he do
when you start moving 2,000 keys...</i>

871
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:47,358
Fuck Gaspar Gomez
and fuck the Diaz brothers!

872
01:09:47,441 --> 01:09:48,608
<i>Fuck 'em all!</i>

873
01:09:49,442 --> 01:09:51,735
I'll bury those cockroaches!

874
01:09:53,318 --> 01:09:55,110
What they ever do for us?

875
01:10:02,905 --> 01:10:05,906
Look, Frank, the time has come.

876
01:10:07,408 --> 01:10:09,075
We gotta expand.

877
01:10:09,867 --> 01:10:12,743
The whole operation. Distribution.

878
01:10:14,077 --> 01:10:17,120
New York, Chicago, LA.

879
01:10:18,828 --> 01:10:21,621
We gotta set our own mark
and enforce it.

880
01:10:22,538 --> 01:10:24,205
We gotta think big now.

881
01:10:28,874 --> 01:10:30,082
Think big.

882
01:10:36,128 --> 01:10:37,795
<i>Like your friend Sosa.</i>

883
01:10:40,170 --> 01:10:43,547
Let me tell you something
about that greaseball cocksucker.

884
01:10:44,088 --> 01:10:46,673
He is a snake, that's what he is.

885
01:10:48,549 --> 01:10:52,509
<i>You turn your back on him,
he'll stick it in.</i>

886
01:10:53,301 --> 01:10:55,428
<i>You don't trust a guy like that.</i>

887
01:10:56,928 --> 01:10:59,137
You want me to believe...

888
01:10:59,888 --> 01:11:03,971
Omar was a stoolie
because Sosa said so?

889
01:11:04,513 --> 01:11:06,014
You bought that line?

890
01:11:07,308 --> 01:11:10,142
<i>Maybe I made a mistake
sending you down there.</i>

891
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:14,643
Maybe you and Sosa
know something I don't know.

892
01:11:17,977 --> 01:11:19,102
Like what?

893
01:11:20,313 --> 01:11:21,771
Like what?

894
01:11:23,354 --> 01:11:25,440
You tell me, "Like what."

895
01:11:29,692 --> 01:11:32,233
You calling me a liar, Frank?

896
01:11:33,275 --> 01:11:35,027
That what you're calling me?

897
01:11:41,028 --> 01:11:44,823
Let's just say I want things
to stay the way they are for now.

898
01:11:48,157 --> 01:11:50,700
You stall your deal with Sosa.

899
01:11:52,451 --> 01:11:53,702
Stall it?

900
01:11:58,202 --> 01:11:59,661
Okay, boss.

901
01:12:00,328 --> 01:12:01,370
Come on.

902
01:12:03,871 --> 01:12:05,080
I am the boss.

903
01:12:06,456 --> 01:12:08,874
Sure, you're the boss.
Hey, Tony.

904
01:12:13,251 --> 01:12:15,793
Remember I told you
when you started...

905
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:18,462
the guys who last
in this business...

906
01:12:19,378 --> 01:12:21,587
are the guys who fly straight...

907
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:24,379
<i>low-key, quiet.</i>

908
01:12:25,672 --> 01:12:27,716
<i>And the guys who want it all...</i>

909
01:12:28,424 --> 01:12:31,716
<i>chicas, champagne, flash...</i>

910
01:12:33,676 --> 01:12:35,176
they don't last.

911
01:12:36,635 --> 01:12:37,928
You finished?

912
01:12:38,845 --> 01:12:40,053
Can I go now?

913
01:13:02,354 --> 01:13:04,063
Hi, there.

914
01:13:11,441 --> 01:13:13,025
You just missed Frank.

915
01:13:16,192 --> 01:13:17,318
Too bad.

916
01:13:19,735 --> 01:13:21,821
Only I didn't come to see Frank.

917
01:13:23,321 --> 01:13:26,280
This is not the time
or the place, Tony.

918
01:13:26,781 --> 01:13:29,324
Make an appointment.
That's okay.

919
01:13:29,449 --> 01:13:32,533
I got something important
I want to talk to you about.

920
01:13:39,452 --> 01:13:42,036
<i>So why don't we have
a couple of drinks...</i>

921
01:13:42,495 --> 01:13:43,912
<i>act normal...</i>

922
01:13:46,206 --> 01:13:47,999
<i>and just take it easy.</i>

923
01:13:48,832 --> 01:13:50,750
<i>Come on. I like Scotch.</i>

924
01:13:55,583 --> 01:13:58,918
- Sure. Why not?
- Okay. I won't bite you.

925
01:14:01,544 --> 01:14:03,545
We're all normal here.

926
01:14:07,297 --> 01:14:11,008
I heard you and Frank
aren't working together anymore.

927
01:14:11,383 --> 01:14:12,716
That's right.

928
01:14:17,343 --> 01:14:19,551
I think it's easier, don't you?

929
01:14:20,344 --> 01:14:22,052
Makes things easier.

930
01:14:24,596 --> 01:14:25,680
Thank you.

931
01:14:27,055 --> 01:14:29,180
Here's to "the land of opportunity."

932
01:14:30,223 --> 01:14:31,682
For you, maybe.

933
01:14:36,726 --> 01:14:37,934
You like kids?

934
01:14:39,810 --> 01:14:40,853
Kids?

935
01:14:41,478 --> 01:14:43,729
Kids. You know, kids. Little kids.

936
01:14:45,522 --> 01:14:47,605
Sure. Why not?

937
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:49,524
As long as there's a nurse.

938
01:14:49,607 --> 01:14:52,565
Good, 'cause I like kids, too.

939
01:14:54,525 --> 01:14:58,651
I like them. Boys, girls.
Don't matter to me.

940
01:15:01,945 --> 01:15:04,071
Frank's gonna be back any minute.

941
01:15:04,613 --> 01:15:06,071
Come here.

942
01:15:13,115 --> 01:15:14,158
Sit here.

943
01:15:15,033 --> 01:15:18,325
<i>I want to talk to you. Sit down.
I'm not gonna bite you.</i>

944
01:15:24,246 --> 01:15:26,080
Okay, here's the story.

945
01:15:29,331 --> 01:15:32,540
I come from the gutter. I know that.

946
01:15:34,917 --> 01:15:36,583
I got no education...

947
01:15:37,458 --> 01:15:39,001
but that's okay.

948
01:15:40,334 --> 01:15:42,461
I know the street...

949
01:15:42,586 --> 01:15:45,046
and I'm making
all the right connections.

950
01:15:46,171 --> 01:15:49,756
With the right woman,
there's no stopping me.

951
01:15:50,506 --> 01:15:52,590
I could go right to the top.

952
01:15:54,758 --> 01:15:55,841
Anyway...

953
01:15:56,716 --> 01:15:58,884
what I got to tell you is this:

954
01:16:01,053 --> 01:16:02,594
I like you.

955
01:16:05,887 --> 01:16:08,638
I liked you
the first time I laid eyes on you.

956
01:16:11,889 --> 01:16:14,433
I said, "She's a tiger.

957
01:16:16,891 --> 01:16:18,810
"She'll belong to me."

958
01:16:22,812 --> 01:16:24,270
Anyway...

959
01:16:25,562 --> 01:16:27,355
I want you to marry me.

960
01:16:30,439 --> 01:16:33,356
I want you to be
the mother of my children.

961
01:16:36,191 --> 01:16:39,234
Me? Marry you?

962
01:16:39,319 --> 01:16:40,569
That's right.

963
01:16:45,321 --> 01:16:47,072
What about Frank, Tony?

964
01:16:47,738 --> 01:16:49,363
<i>What will you do about Frank?</i>

965
01:16:49,447 --> 01:16:52,948
Frank is not gonna last, okay?
He's finished.

966
01:16:55,324 --> 01:16:57,825
Just think about it, okay?

967
01:16:59,159 --> 01:17:01,536
I want you to really think about it.

968
01:17:04,204 --> 01:17:07,163
I'll go now. Take care.

969
01:17:15,707 --> 01:17:17,541
All your enemies are gone.

970
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,627
- Mr. Montana. How are you?
- Hello.

971
01:17:29,339 --> 01:17:31,298
What the fuck she doing here?

972
01:17:31,465 --> 01:17:35,799
Come on, man. She's just
dancing. Come on. Take it easy.

973
01:17:48,929 --> 01:17:52,514
- It's just a disco.
- Who's that guy she's with?

974
01:17:53,764 --> 01:17:56,141
He's some guy who works
for Luco. He's nobody.

975
01:17:56,225 --> 01:17:57,934
- He's harmless.
- Works for Luco?

976
01:17:58,017 --> 01:18:00,435
Yeah. Forget him.

977
01:18:02,393 --> 01:18:06,312
Hello, Tony. You remember me?

978
01:18:08,770 --> 01:18:12,605
Bernstein. Mel Bernstein, right?

979
01:18:13,481 --> 01:18:15,608
Chief Detective, Narcotics.

980
01:18:16,566 --> 01:18:19,192
That's right, yeah.
I think we should talk.

981
01:18:19,901 --> 01:18:22,486
Talk?
What are we going to talk about?

982
01:18:23,069 --> 01:18:26,070
I ain't killed nobody, not lately.

983
01:18:26,487 --> 01:18:28,278
No, not lately.

984
01:18:28,362 --> 01:18:32,072
What about ancient history,
like Emilio Rebenga?

985
01:18:32,155 --> 01:18:35,323
Or a bunch of whacked-out Indians
at the Sun Ray Motel?

986
01:18:36,949 --> 01:18:39,034
Whoever's giving you
your information...

987
01:18:39,118 --> 01:18:40,827
is taking you for a long ride.

988
01:18:42,410 --> 01:18:44,786
Tony, baby, we gonna talk...

989
01:18:44,870 --> 01:18:47,786
or am I gonna bust
your wiseass spic balls...

990
01:18:47,870 --> 01:18:49,288
here and now?

991
01:18:55,164 --> 01:18:56,707
Keep your eye on her.

992
01:18:57,790 --> 01:18:59,334
I'll do that.
Okay.

993
01:19:01,042 --> 01:19:03,042
- My office.
- Good.

994
01:19:10,838 --> 01:19:14,464
<i>The word on the street is
you're bringing in a lot of yeyo.</i>

995
01:19:14,714 --> 01:19:17,258
That means you're not
a small-time punk anymore...

996
01:19:17,341 --> 01:19:19,134
you're public property now.

997
01:19:19,259 --> 01:19:22,050
Supreme Court says
that your privacy can be invaded.

998
01:19:22,134 --> 01:19:23,885
Okay. How much?

999
01:19:25,469 --> 01:19:26,844
How much?

1000
01:19:27,552 --> 01:19:30,013
There's an answer to that, too.

1001
01:19:36,599 --> 01:19:37,975
<i>Here's how much.</i>

1002
01:19:39,225 --> 01:19:40,517
Can you see it?

1003
01:19:42,602 --> 01:19:44,477
- Big number.
- Yeah!

1004
01:19:44,644 --> 01:19:47,561
That's on a monthly basis,
same thing every month.

1005
01:19:47,978 --> 01:19:49,728
You know how this works?

1006
01:19:51,646 --> 01:19:53,023
No. You tell me.

1007
01:19:53,648 --> 01:19:56,024
We tell you
who's moving against you...

1008
01:19:56,399 --> 01:19:59,233
and we shake down
who you want shaken down.

1009
01:20:00,109 --> 01:20:03,443
Let's say that you got
a real problem making a collection.

1010
01:20:04,818 --> 01:20:06,693
And then we step in for you.

1011
01:20:07,111 --> 01:20:09,445
Got eight killers with badges
working for me.

1012
01:20:09,529 --> 01:20:12,655
When they hit, it hurts.
Same thing works the other way.

1013
01:20:12,738 --> 01:20:14,822
You feed me a bust now and then.

1014
01:20:15,156 --> 01:20:18,409
<i>Some cowboy setting himself up
in business.</i>

1015
01:20:19,117 --> 01:20:21,325
Small fry, you know?

1016
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:26,787
We like snacks.

1017
01:20:27,037 --> 01:20:30,412
How do I know you're the last cop
I'm gonna have to grease?

1018
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:35,831
What about Fort Lauderdale?
Metro? DEA?

1019
01:20:36,666 --> 01:20:39,582
How do I know what rock
they're gonna crawl out from under?

1020
01:20:39,666 --> 01:20:43,918
Well, that's not my business, Tony.
We don't cross no lines.

1021
01:20:45,252 --> 01:20:49,836
You think I want this conversation
going any farther than this table?

1022
01:20:50,336 --> 01:20:53,506
My guys got families.
They're legitimate cops.

1023
01:20:53,798 --> 01:20:55,799
I don't want
to see them embarrassed.

1024
01:20:55,882 --> 01:20:57,757
If they're embarrassed,
they'll suffer.

1025
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:00,590
If they suffer,
they'll make you suffer.

1026
01:21:03,176 --> 01:21:05,553
<i>You understand
what I'm talking about?</i>

1027
01:21:16,265 --> 01:21:17,890
Thanks for the drink.

1028
01:21:20,767 --> 01:21:22,267
By the way...

1029
01:21:23,309 --> 01:21:25,310
I got a vacation coming up.

1030
01:21:25,518 --> 01:21:27,976
I'm gonna take the wife
to London, England.

1031
01:21:28,060 --> 01:21:29,561
We've never been there.

1032
01:21:29,644 --> 01:21:32,939
So throw in a couple
of round-trip tickets, first class.

1033
01:21:39,817 --> 01:21:43,025
You gotta smile more, Tony.
You gotta enjoy yourself.

1034
01:21:43,650 --> 01:21:46,068
Every day above ground
is a good day.

1035
01:21:58,782 --> 01:22:00,825
- Hello.
- Hello.

1036
01:22:02,283 --> 01:22:04,326
Yeah. Now that's the idea.

1037
01:22:04,535 --> 01:22:06,243
Okay, Mel.

1038
01:22:08,618 --> 01:22:10,494
You think about what I said?

1039
01:22:11,078 --> 01:22:12,329
About the kids?

1040
01:22:13,788 --> 01:22:18,247
- You know, you are really nuts.
- I'm nuts about you.

1041
01:22:19,124 --> 01:22:21,458
Why don't you find your own girl?

1042
01:22:21,749 --> 01:22:22,917
My own girl?
Yeah.

1043
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:26,043
That's what I'm doing.
Do it somewhere else.

1044
01:22:26,126 --> 01:22:28,293
Maybe I don't hear
so good sometimes.

1045
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:30,752
You won't hear anything
if you go on like this.

1046
01:22:30,836 --> 01:22:32,046
Will you do something?

1047
01:22:32,129 --> 01:22:34,880
You're fucking right
I'm going to do something!

1048
01:22:36,130 --> 01:22:38,089
I'm giving you orders. Blow!

1049
01:22:38,214 --> 01:22:41,924
Orders? You giving me orders?

1050
01:22:47,468 --> 01:22:49,845
The only thing in this world...

1051
01:22:49,928 --> 01:22:53,513
that gives orders is balls.
You got that?

1052
01:22:55,097 --> 01:22:56,305
<i>Balls.</i>

1053
01:23:06,726 --> 01:23:07,894
Let's go.

1054
01:23:15,689 --> 01:23:16,814
Elvira.

1055
01:23:18,273 --> 01:23:19,982
When you gonna learn?

1056
01:23:22,733 --> 01:23:26,484
Looking good, honey.
Keep up the bad work.

1057
01:23:28,235 --> 01:23:30,319
That cocksucker.
What happened?

1058
01:23:31,236 --> 01:23:35,072
- He put that prick Bernstein on me.
- Who? Lopez did?

1059
01:23:36,614 --> 01:23:37,781
How do you know?

1060
01:23:37,865 --> 01:23:40,281
Who else knew about Rebenga?
Omar?

1061
01:23:40,865 --> 01:23:42,533
<i>He's fertilizer.</i>

1062
01:23:43,033 --> 01:23:45,575
He's letting me know
he's got weight on me.

1063
01:23:48,784 --> 01:23:50,452
I'll tell you what, man.

1064
01:23:50,535 --> 01:23:53,496
<i>You know our little trip
we've been planning to New York?</i>

1065
01:23:53,579 --> 01:23:55,287
<i>It might be a good time.</i>

1066
01:24:12,379 --> 01:24:14,337
Wait. Where you going?

1067
01:24:40,139 --> 01:24:41,890
Welcome to my private room.

1068
01:24:41,973 --> 01:24:44,724
- Your private room.
- This is my private room.

1069
01:24:44,807 --> 01:24:48,435
<i>I got a beautiful, nice,
white lounge chair for you.</i>

1070
01:24:53,521 --> 01:24:55,938
<i>Gina, you taste so muy bueno.</i>

1071
01:25:01,356 --> 01:25:03,274
What are you doing?
Shut up!

1072
01:25:03,357 --> 01:25:07,025
We wasn't doing nothing!
Fernando, wait!

1073
01:25:07,359 --> 01:25:08,734
Get out!

1074
01:25:11,529 --> 01:25:12,945
Damn you!

1075
01:25:13,029 --> 01:25:14,738
You think he's cute?

1076
01:25:14,821 --> 01:25:17,280
I saw him putting his hand
all over your ass.

1077
01:25:17,405 --> 01:25:19,280
My kid sister in a toilet.

1078
01:25:19,363 --> 01:25:20,573
It's none of your business.

1079
01:25:20,657 --> 01:25:23,115
None of my business?
The fuck it ain't!

1080
01:25:23,198 --> 01:25:25,491
Don't tell me what to do!
I'll tell you!

1081
01:25:25,616 --> 01:25:27,617
Listen to me. Come here.

1082
01:25:28,660 --> 01:25:33,869
I catch you here again, I'm gonna
wipe you all over the fucking place.

1083
01:25:34,246 --> 01:25:37,163
Yeah? Go ahead!
Do it now. I want to see it.

1084
01:25:37,246 --> 01:25:39,540
- I want to see it now, big shot.
- Don't push me.

1085
01:25:39,623 --> 01:25:43,206
- I want to see it now!
- Don't push me! Get outta here!

1086
01:25:43,456 --> 01:25:47,001
- Go outside.
- You got some nerve, Tony!

1087
01:25:47,626 --> 01:25:50,127
You think you can
tell me what to do?

1088
01:25:50,252 --> 01:25:53,252
You can't tell me what to do.
I'm not a baby anymore.

1089
01:25:53,335 --> 01:25:56,171
I'll do what I want to do,
see whoever I want to see.

1090
01:25:56,296 --> 01:25:59,381
And if I want to fuck them,
then I'll fuck them!

1091
01:26:01,006 --> 01:26:03,674
Fucking, man! Come on, man.

1092
01:26:07,842 --> 01:26:10,427
What the fuck you want?
You want something?

1093
01:26:11,427 --> 01:26:13,637
No. Don't touch me.

1094
01:26:15,804 --> 01:26:17,512
- No.
- We've got to get out of here.

1095
01:26:17,595 --> 01:26:21,471
Not there.
I don't want to go out there.

1096
01:26:22,181 --> 01:26:24,474
<i>Another great night here
at the Babylon?</i>

1097
01:26:24,558 --> 01:26:26,517
<i>Okay. All right!</i>

1098
01:26:26,767 --> 01:26:29,351
<i>Do another gram,
you'll all be babbling on.</i>

1099
01:26:30,351 --> 01:26:33,187
<i>Is that coke in your bra,
or are you just glad to see me?</i>

1100
01:26:33,270 --> 01:26:35,312
<i>A little bit of hope, I'm sure, yes.</i>

1101
01:26:35,395 --> 01:26:38,479
<i>I'm in a good mood. I was depressed
when I got up this morning.</i>

1102
01:26:38,646 --> 01:26:41,522
<i>I had a dry dream,
but I'm better now.</i>

1103
01:26:56,820 --> 01:26:59,155
<i>I do Laurel and Hardy
in Spanish, too.</i>

1104
01:27:01,780 --> 01:27:03,906
<i>That's the height of culture,
I assure you.</i>

1105
01:27:03,989 --> 01:27:07,451
<i>But my favorite Cuban of all time
has to be Ricky Ricardo.</i>

1106
01:27:07,742 --> 01:27:09,826
<i>Mr. Babalu himself.</i>

1107
01:27:09,909 --> 01:27:11,659
<i>He had the same problem
for 10 years.</i>

1108
01:27:11,742 --> 01:27:14,411
<i>"Lucy, don't come down to the club."</i>

1109
01:27:46,383 --> 01:27:49,467
He's your brother. He loves you.
That's why he did it.

1110
01:27:49,592 --> 01:27:51,635
All right? He cares about you.

1111
01:27:51,719 --> 01:27:54,344
To him,
you're still his little sister.

1112
01:27:54,469 --> 01:27:57,886
That's the problem.
He still treats me like I'm a baby.

1113
01:27:57,970 --> 01:27:59,470
I'm 20 years old now.

1114
01:27:59,553 --> 01:28:02,431
- I'm not anybody's baby.
- You're so grown-up.

1115
01:28:05,265 --> 01:28:08,642
Come on, Gina.
Put yourself in his place, okay?

1116
01:28:08,726 --> 01:28:12,352
Right now, you happen
to be the best thing in his life.

1117
01:28:12,477 --> 01:28:16,394
The only thing that's any good,
that's pure.

1118
01:28:17,269 --> 01:28:20,187
Of course he doesn't want you
mixing with those people...

1119
01:28:20,271 --> 01:28:21,688
growing up to be like him.

1120
01:28:22,981 --> 01:28:26,275
He has this father thing for you.
Feels like he has to protect you.

1121
01:28:26,359 --> 01:28:28,109
Protect me against what?

1122
01:28:28,442 --> 01:28:32,068
Against guys like that asshole
you were dancing with tonight.

1123
01:28:32,151 --> 01:28:36,237
I like Fernando.
He's a fun guy and he's nice.

1124
01:28:37,820 --> 01:28:40,738
And he knows how to treat a woman.
All right?

1125
01:28:41,029 --> 01:28:42,864
- He knows how to treat a woman?
- Yes.

1126
01:28:42,947 --> 01:28:45,032
By taking her to the toilet
to make out?

1127
01:28:45,116 --> 01:28:49,116
<i>You've been a great audience.
I got a special treat for you.</i>

1128
01:28:49,199 --> 01:28:50,826
<i>Here's a guy I found in the jungle.</i>

1129
01:28:50,909 --> 01:28:53,785
<i>From Caracas, Venezuela.
He's unlike anything you've seen.</i>

1130
01:28:53,869 --> 01:28:57,453
<i>Give a warm Babylon welcome
to the one and only Octavio!</i>

1131
01:29:22,797 --> 01:29:26,340
Look around. Go out with someone
who has something on the ball...

1132
01:29:26,465 --> 01:29:29,175
- who's going somewhere in life.
- Like who?

1133
01:29:29,884 --> 01:29:33,259
For instance, someone who's got
a real job, like a banker.

1134
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:36,176
Or, or a doctor, a lawyer...
What about you?

1135
01:29:38,596 --> 01:29:41,764
- What are you talking about?
- Why don't you take me out?

1136
01:29:41,847 --> 01:29:43,765
Are you crazy?

1137
01:29:43,848 --> 01:29:45,848
I see the way you look at me,
Manolo.

1138
01:29:46,181 --> 01:29:49,017
Do you think I'm blind? I see.
Come on.

1139
01:29:49,475 --> 01:29:51,433
What?
Look, Gina...

1140
01:29:52,892 --> 01:29:55,560
Tony and I are like brothers,
all right?

1141
01:29:55,894 --> 01:29:57,560
You're his kid sister.

1142
01:29:57,644 --> 01:29:59,311
- So what?
- That's where it ends.

1143
01:30:00,061 --> 01:30:03,231
- That's where it stays.
- Are you afraid of Tony?

1144
01:30:04,149 --> 01:30:07,649
- You afraid of Tony's kid sister?
- I'm not afraid of anybody!

1145
01:30:07,983 --> 01:30:09,900
<i>That's not the point here!</i>

1146
01:32:28,414 --> 01:32:30,374
It's not for me. Don't look at me.

1147
01:32:30,458 --> 01:32:33,541
How do you know?
'Cause I'm not here.

1148
01:32:33,624 --> 01:32:35,501
Really? Then where are you?

1149
01:32:38,502 --> 01:32:40,045
Shit, you're weird.

1150
01:32:40,128 --> 01:32:42,462
- I'm weird?
- Hello?

1151
01:32:42,587 --> 01:32:44,922
<i>Hello, Miriam?
Tony!</i>

1152
01:32:45,005 --> 01:32:48,255
<i>Put Manny on, okay?
Okay. Just a second.</i>

1153
01:32:48,630 --> 01:32:49,881
It's Tony.

1154
01:32:52,924 --> 01:32:55,134
<i>What are you doing,
checking up on me?</i>

1155
01:32:55,218 --> 01:32:57,052
Get your clothes on and meet me...

1156
01:32:57,177 --> 01:32:59,345
in front of Lopez Motors
in 45 minutes.

1157
01:32:59,886 --> 01:33:03,096
<i>What? What happened?
Nothing we can't face.</i>

1158
01:33:03,722 --> 01:33:06,097
All right. I'll be there.

1159
01:33:06,180 --> 01:33:08,806
<i>You're still on the phone. Let's go.</i>

1160
01:33:08,889 --> 01:33:10,014
Take it easy, okay?

1161
01:33:10,098 --> 01:33:12,974
I'm leaving now. Fuck.

1162
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:15,183
Nick?
Yeah, Tony.

1163
01:33:15,266 --> 01:33:17,642
This is what
I want you to do for me:

1164
01:33:19,061 --> 01:33:20,854
<i>You call Lopez.</i>

1165
01:33:21,312 --> 01:33:25,063
<i>Call him at his office
at 3:00 sharp.</i>

1166
01:33:25,938 --> 01:33:28,857
<i>And you tell him:</i>

1167
01:33:29,982 --> 01:33:32,107
<i>"We fucked up, he got away."</i>

1168
01:33:32,773 --> 01:33:35,316
Okay. Yeah.
Got it? What're you going to say?

1169
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:37,318
"We fucked up. He got away."

1170
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:40,861
What time?
3:00 sharp.

1171
01:33:43,113 --> 01:33:45,904
So when are we gonna make
some money on this thing?

1172
01:33:45,988 --> 01:33:48,948
<i>Six months to start
don't mean shit, Larry.</i>

1173
01:33:49,490 --> 01:33:52,782
<i>I'm not a Rockefeller, you know.
Not yet, anyway.</i>

1174
01:33:54,449 --> 01:33:56,159
<i>So you owe me.</i>

1175
01:33:57,369 --> 01:33:59,869
<i>Listen, go down
to the ball game tonight.</i>

1176
01:34:00,327 --> 01:34:03,620
<i>I couldn't make it. I got things.
I'll tell you about them.</i>

1177
01:34:04,579 --> 01:34:07,873
You're kidding? What was the score?
Three to two?

1178
01:34:09,248 --> 01:34:10,498
Mel, guess what?

1179
01:34:10,581 --> 01:34:12,415
My Little League team,
the Little Lopezers...

1180
01:34:12,499 --> 01:34:14,250
they won the division tonight.

1181
01:34:14,375 --> 01:34:16,667
That's great. Congratulations.

1182
01:34:17,085 --> 01:34:19,877
What'd you do, fix the umpire?

1183
01:34:22,754 --> 01:34:25,379
Jesus Christ.

1184
01:34:27,296 --> 01:34:29,213
<i>Tony, what happened to you?</i>

1185
01:34:32,049 --> 01:34:35,009
They wanted to spoil my $800 suit.

1186
01:34:36,092 --> 01:34:38,135
Who the fuck did this?

1187
01:34:38,801 --> 01:34:41,470
Hitters. I don't know.

1188
01:34:42,595 --> 01:34:44,762
Somebody must've brought them in.

1189
01:34:45,387 --> 01:34:47,179
I've never seen them before.

1190
01:34:47,638 --> 01:34:48,972
Hello, Mel.

1191
01:34:50,389 --> 01:34:52,140
Got an answer to this, too?

1192
01:34:53,181 --> 01:34:56,643
There always is, Tony.
I'll bet it was the Diaz brothers.

1193
01:34:56,726 --> 01:34:59,519
They got a beef going back
to the Sun Ray thing.

1194
01:35:00,727 --> 01:35:03,186
Maybe you're right, you know?

1195
01:35:05,186 --> 01:35:09,688
Anyway, I'm glad you made it, Tony.

1196
01:35:10,773 --> 01:35:13,857
We'll return the favor for you,
in spades.

1197
01:35:13,940 --> 01:35:16,734
I'll take care of this myself.

1198
01:35:22,569 --> 01:35:24,445
What is the gun for, Tony?

1199
01:35:25,363 --> 01:35:28,155
What, this? It's nothing.

1200
01:35:29,821 --> 01:35:34,074
I'm... How do you say? Paranoid.

1201
01:35:48,496 --> 01:35:50,289
You gonna answer, Frank?

1202
01:35:52,499 --> 01:35:56,167
It must be Elvira.
She got mad after we left the club.

1203
01:35:59,334 --> 01:36:01,210
I'll tell her you're not here, okay?

1204
01:36:01,294 --> 01:36:05,128
No, it's all right.
I'll talk to her.

1205
01:36:13,132 --> 01:36:14,300
Hello.

1206
01:36:21,135 --> 01:36:24,553
It's all right. I'm gonna be home
in an hour. Don't worry.

1207
01:36:27,595 --> 01:36:30,763
Frank, you're a piece of shit.

1208
01:36:30,930 --> 01:36:34,558
- What are you talking about?
- You know what I'm talking about...

1209
01:36:34,641 --> 01:36:37,142
you fucking cockroach.

1210
01:36:37,267 --> 01:36:40,185
What are you talking about?
Listen to me.

1211
01:36:40,310 --> 01:36:42,476
<i>You know what a chazer is, Frank?</i>

1212
01:36:43,519 --> 01:36:46,520
<i>That's a pig
that don't fly straight.</i>

1213
01:36:47,603 --> 01:36:49,271
Neither do you, Frank.

1214
01:36:50,772 --> 01:36:53,649
Tony, why the fuck would I hurt you?

1215
01:36:53,982 --> 01:36:55,732
I brought you in.

1216
01:36:55,816 --> 01:36:58,359
So we had a few differences,
no big deal.

1217
01:36:59,693 --> 01:37:02,652
I gave you your start.
I was the one who believed in you.

1218
01:37:02,735 --> 01:37:04,861
I stayed loyal to you.

1219
01:37:07,153 --> 01:37:10,656
I made what I could on the side,
but I never turned on you, Frank!

1220
01:37:11,323 --> 01:37:12,323
Never!

1221
01:37:16,115 --> 01:37:17,324
But you...

1222
01:37:20,909 --> 01:37:25,411
a man who ain't got his word
is a cockroach.

1223
01:37:28,996 --> 01:37:31,706
Mel. Do something, will you?

1224
01:37:36,082 --> 01:37:38,750
It's your tree, Frank.
You're sitting in it.

1225
01:37:46,544 --> 01:37:49,797
All right, Tony. I was the one.

1226
01:37:56,507 --> 01:37:58,967
Please, give me a second chance.

1227
01:38:00,717 --> 01:38:03,594
Will you do that? Please?

1228
01:38:08,470 --> 01:38:12,098
Give me a second chance.
I'll give you $10 million.

1229
01:38:12,599 --> 01:38:16,015
<i>Okay? $10 million.</i>

1230
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:19,808
I got it in a vault
over there in Spain, Tony.

1231
01:38:19,933 --> 01:38:24,477
We go over there,
we get on a plane, and it's yours.

1232
01:38:25,185 --> 01:38:28,520
Okay? All of it. $10 million.

1233
01:38:29,395 --> 01:38:30,563
<i>Okay, Tony?</i>

1234
01:38:34,689 --> 01:38:35,983
Please, Tony?

1235
01:38:37,816 --> 01:38:41,026
Elvira? You want Elvira?

1236
01:38:41,818 --> 01:38:44,860
<i>You can have her. I'll go away.
I'm gonna disappear.</i>

1237
01:38:44,943 --> 01:38:48,529
You'll never see me again.
Please, Tony, I don't want to die.

1238
01:38:48,613 --> 01:38:50,572
I never did nothing to nobody.

1239
01:38:50,739 --> 01:38:53,697
No, you never did nothing to nobody.

1240
01:38:53,905 --> 01:38:55,865
You had somebody else do it for you.

1241
01:38:55,948 --> 01:38:57,324
Tony, I'm begging you.

1242
01:38:57,407 --> 01:39:01,159
- Get up! Get up now!
- Jesus! No! God!

1243
01:39:06,161 --> 01:39:09,829
Look. Tony, no!
Don't kill me, please.

1244
01:39:12,747 --> 01:39:14,205
I won't kill you.

1245
01:39:14,874 --> 01:39:16,874
- Christ, thank you.
- Get off my foot.

1246
01:39:16,957 --> 01:39:20,666
Thank you.
Manolo, shoot that piece of shit!

1247
01:39:20,916 --> 01:39:22,500
No! No!

1248
01:39:42,675 --> 01:39:45,593
Every dog has his day, Mel?

1249
01:39:45,676 --> 01:39:46,886
I told him...

1250
01:39:48,386 --> 01:39:50,222
it didn't make any sense...

1251
01:39:50,305 --> 01:39:54,140
clipping you when we had you
working for us. He wouldn't listen.

1252
01:39:54,973 --> 01:39:58,806
<i>He got hot tonight about the broad.</i>

1253
01:40:00,933 --> 01:40:02,392
He fucked up.

1254
01:40:03,142 --> 01:40:06,894
You, too, Mel. You fucked up.

1255
01:40:08,103 --> 01:40:09,771
Don't go too far, Tony.

1256
01:40:11,354 --> 01:40:14,148
I'm not, Mel. You are.

1257
01:40:23,025 --> 01:40:25,944
Fuck. You can't shoot a cop!

1258
01:40:27,486 --> 01:40:29,029
Whoever says you was one?

1259
01:40:29,112 --> 01:40:30,654
Wait a minute!

1260
01:40:32,737 --> 01:40:34,864
You let me go. I'll fix this up.

1261
01:40:35,447 --> 01:40:39,491
Sure, Mel.
Maybe you can hand yourself...

1262
01:40:39,866 --> 01:40:43,242
one of them first-class tickets
to the Resurrection.

1263
01:40:43,701 --> 01:40:47,411
Fucking punk! Son of a bitch!

1264
01:40:49,203 --> 01:40:51,953
- So long, Mel. Have a good trip.
- Fuck you!

1265
01:40:58,790 --> 01:41:01,957
- Okay, come on.
- What about Ernie?

1266
01:41:12,087 --> 01:41:13,755
You want a job, Ernie?

1267
01:41:17,381 --> 01:41:20,549
- Sure, Tony.
- Okay, then you call me tomorrow.

1268
01:41:21,215 --> 01:41:23,050
Man, you got a job!

1269
01:41:23,966 --> 01:41:26,426
Tony! Thanks.

1270
01:42:02,066 --> 01:42:03,901
God, what's happened?

1271
01:42:06,152 --> 01:42:07,527
Where's Frank?

1272
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:11,070
Where do you think?

1273
01:42:16,281 --> 01:42:19,864
<i>Come on. Get your stuff.</i>

1274
01:42:20,323 --> 01:42:21,908
<i>You're coming with me.</i>

1275
01:46:58,938 --> 01:47:02,397
So you come to me
with some kind of thing. Okay.

1276
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:04,481
<i>You propose it, I talk to you.</i>

1277
01:47:04,940 --> 01:47:08,232
<i>But we got a problem.
I can't pay more.</i>

1278
01:47:09,359 --> 01:47:12,359
I'm bringing in twice as much
as I ever did before.

1279
01:47:12,568 --> 01:47:15,945
We're doing $10 million,
$15 million a month. Come on.

1280
01:47:16,154 --> 01:47:18,196
That's serious money.

1281
01:47:18,446 --> 01:47:20,280
You bank boys gotta come down a bit.

1282
01:47:20,363 --> 01:47:21,363
No way.

1283
01:47:21,488 --> 01:47:25,282
- That's crazy. We can't do that.
- Then that's too bad.

1284
01:47:25,574 --> 01:47:28,825
- What am I gonna do?
- We're not a wholesale operation.

1285
01:47:28,908 --> 01:47:32,451
We're a legitimate bank.
The more cash you give me...

1286
01:47:32,701 --> 01:47:34,911
the harder it is for me to rinse.

1287
01:47:35,453 --> 01:47:37,329
That's a problem. I didn't know.

1288
01:47:37,412 --> 01:47:40,330
The fact is, I can't take any more
of your money...

1289
01:47:40,413 --> 01:47:42,747
unless I raise the rates on you.

1290
01:47:44,373 --> 01:47:46,165
- You gonna raise the...
- I gotta do it.

1291
01:47:46,290 --> 01:47:47,457
The IRS is coming...

1292
01:47:47,540 --> 01:47:50,167
Don't give me that shit! Let's talk.

1293
01:47:50,292 --> 01:47:51,334
I'm talking.

1294
01:47:51,417 --> 01:47:53,876
I go low, you go high.
I know the game.

1295
01:47:53,960 --> 01:47:56,544
- This is business talk.
- Let me explain something.

1296
01:47:56,627 --> 01:47:59,047
The IRS is coming down heavy
on South Florida.

1297
01:47:59,130 --> 01:48:01,589
<i>There was a Time Magazine story
that didn't help.</i>

1298
01:48:01,672 --> 01:48:03,131
There's a recession.

1299
01:48:03,215 --> 01:48:05,548
I got stockholders
I got to be responsible for.

1300
01:48:05,631 --> 01:48:08,050
- I got to do it, Tony.
- You'll learn from him.

1301
01:48:08,133 --> 01:48:11,508
I got to go 10% on the first
$12 million in denominations of 20.

1302
01:48:11,592 --> 01:48:13,593
<i>I'll go 8% on your $10 bills...</i>

1303
01:48:13,676 --> 01:48:14,719
<i>6% on your fives.</i>

1304
01:48:14,802 --> 01:48:16,636
- We'll go somewhere else.
- That's it.

1305
01:48:16,720 --> 01:48:20,221
- There's no place else to go.
- Fuck you, man! Fuck you!

1306
01:48:20,304 --> 01:48:23,139
I'll fly the cash myself
to the Bahamas.

1307
01:48:23,681 --> 01:48:25,640
Once, maybe. Then what?

1308
01:48:26,849 --> 01:48:29,141
You'll trust some monkey
in a Bahamian bank...

1309
01:48:29,225 --> 01:48:31,225
with 20 million
of your hard-earned dollars?

1310
01:48:31,350 --> 01:48:33,184
Come on, Tony. Don't be a schmuck.

1311
01:48:33,517 --> 01:48:34,853
<i>Who else can you trust?</i>

1312
01:48:34,936 --> 01:48:37,729
<i>That's why you pay us so much.
You trust us.</i>

1313
01:48:42,521 --> 01:48:44,272
Did you hear that guy?

1314
01:48:44,689 --> 01:48:47,316
You got to listen to him.
You'll learn something.

1315
01:48:47,399 --> 01:48:48,608
Stay with us.

1316
01:48:48,733 --> 01:48:51,817
You're a well-liked customer.
You're in good hands with us.

1317
01:48:54,236 --> 01:48:56,570
And I got to run.
I'm safe but poor.

1318
01:48:58,028 --> 01:49:01,197
- How's married life treating you?
- Better than you are.

1319
01:49:02,655 --> 01:49:05,864
Say hello to the princess for me.
She's beautiful.

1320
01:49:05,947 --> 01:49:09,656
I'll see you. Take care.
You, too.

1321
01:49:23,038 --> 01:49:24,497
That prick!

1322
01:49:26,123 --> 01:49:27,707
Fucking WASP whore.

1323
01:49:28,749 --> 01:49:32,291
<i>Talking to me like I'm some maricón
who came over on a boat.</i>

1324
01:49:33,667 --> 01:49:36,962
I tell you what. We don't need
that smiling motherfucker.

1325
01:49:37,087 --> 01:49:40,588
We should talk to this Jewish guy,
Seidelbaum, okay?

1326
01:49:40,921 --> 01:49:44,880
He's got his own exchange.
He charges 4% at the most.

1327
01:49:45,590 --> 01:49:47,173
And he's connected.

1328
01:49:48,382 --> 01:49:52,384
Fuck them. Mob guys. Guineas.

1329
01:49:53,842 --> 01:49:55,427
I don't trust them.

1330
01:50:14,685 --> 01:50:17,560
Did you sweep the house this month?
The cars?

1331
01:50:17,977 --> 01:50:21,646
Yeah, I told you about it.
The $5,000?

1332
01:50:22,812 --> 01:50:25,314
- Look at that.
- What?

1333
01:50:26,189 --> 01:50:27,856
That cable truck there.

1334
01:50:27,939 --> 01:50:30,858
<i>Since when does it take three days
to rig a cable?</i>

1335
01:50:33,151 --> 01:50:35,735
What? You been watching it
for three days?

1336
01:50:37,693 --> 01:50:39,945
The thing has been there
for three days.

1337
01:50:40,029 --> 01:50:41,820
What am I gonna do, not look at it?

1338
01:50:42,404 --> 01:50:45,280
- What, you think it's cops, right?
- I don't know.

1339
01:50:45,488 --> 01:50:48,824
Could be the Diaz brothers,
coming to get me.

1340
01:50:50,658 --> 01:50:54,701
- Maybe. I'll check it out, okay?
- You check it out.

1341
01:50:54,785 --> 01:50:58,286
Then we're gonna blow
that fucking truck back to Colombia!

1342
01:50:58,537 --> 01:51:02,912
Come on. We're not the only dopers
living on the block.

1343
01:51:02,995 --> 01:51:04,329
Okay? Remember that.

1344
01:51:04,413 --> 01:51:07,414
That truck could be anybody
and anything.

1345
01:51:07,497 --> 01:51:08,873
<i>It could be a cable company...</i>

1346
01:51:08,956 --> 01:51:11,291
You know something?
You got some fucking attitude.

1347
01:51:11,374 --> 01:51:14,043
For someone who's in charge
of my security...

1348
01:51:14,460 --> 01:51:17,502
Here are the keys to the front door.

1349
01:51:17,585 --> 01:51:19,461
Go down there. Give them the keys!

1350
01:51:19,545 --> 01:51:21,295
I'm just trying to say something.

1351
01:51:21,336 --> 01:51:24,380
You're spending a lot of money
on this counter-surveillance.

1352
01:51:24,463 --> 01:51:25,588
I don't give a fuck.

1353
01:51:25,672 --> 01:51:28,339
It's 12% of our adjusted gross.

1354
01:51:28,423 --> 01:51:29,589
12% isn't peanuts.

1355
01:51:29,673 --> 01:51:30,840
I don't give a fuck!

1356
01:51:30,965 --> 01:51:33,426
It makes me sleep good at night.
That's what counts.

1357
01:51:33,509 --> 01:51:35,842
- Okay? You worry about it.
- I am worried about it.

1358
01:51:35,926 --> 01:51:38,719
I'm telling you.
We're getting sloppy.

1359
01:51:39,219 --> 01:51:42,763
Our thinking, our fucking attitude,
you know?

1360
01:51:42,971 --> 01:51:44,763
We're not fucking hungry anymore.

1361
01:51:45,138 --> 01:51:47,472
<i>Miami's changing.
You can see it everywhere.</i>

1362
01:51:47,556 --> 01:51:49,472
<i>New construction. New jobs.</i>

1363
01:51:49,683 --> 01:51:52,559
<i>Growth that's financed
by Florida Security Trust.</i>

1364
01:51:52,600 --> 01:51:55,267
<i>We've put your money to work
for 75 years...</i>

1365
01:51:55,350 --> 01:51:57,393
<i>building a more prosperous Miami.</i>

1366
01:51:57,810 --> 01:51:59,811
<i>Count on us being here tomorrow.</i>

1367
01:51:59,894 --> 01:52:03,063
That's because for 75 years
you been fucking everybody.

1368
01:52:03,396 --> 01:52:07,064
Somebody should do something
about those whores.

1369
01:52:07,398 --> 01:52:09,982
I mean, charging me 10 points
on my money.

1370
01:52:10,066 --> 01:52:13,858
They're getting away with it.
Fuck, there's no laws anymore.

1371
01:52:13,942 --> 01:52:15,442
- Forget it.
- Anything goes.

1372
01:52:15,525 --> 01:52:19,569
They been around 1,000 years.
They got all the angles figured out.

1373
01:52:20,069 --> 01:52:23,070
You know what capitalism is?
Getting fucked.

1374
01:52:23,195 --> 01:52:25,321
True capitalist if ever I met one.

1375
01:52:27,198 --> 01:52:28,907
Did you hear that?

1376
01:52:30,199 --> 01:52:32,200
How would you know, bubblehead?

1377
01:52:32,950 --> 01:52:35,534
You ever do nothing
besides get your hair fixed...

1378
01:52:35,617 --> 01:52:36,868
and powder your nose?

1379
01:52:37,035 --> 01:52:39,577
Look at you.
You do too much of that shit.

1380
01:52:39,660 --> 01:52:41,786
Nothing exceeds like excess.

1381
01:52:42,244 --> 01:52:45,787
- You should know that, Tony.
- I should know what?

1382
01:52:47,038 --> 01:52:48,581
What should I know?

1383
01:52:48,706 --> 01:52:51,291
Why do you have to talk to me
like that all the time?

1384
01:52:51,374 --> 01:52:54,292
- Like I got to know something.
- Let me talk to you.

1385
01:52:54,625 --> 01:52:56,168
Listen.
What time is it?

1386
01:52:56,210 --> 01:52:57,501
This Seidelbaum.

1387
01:52:57,710 --> 01:52:58,960
6:55.

1388
01:52:59,126 --> 01:53:01,462
Okay.
I met with this Seidelbaum...

1389
01:53:01,545 --> 01:53:05,045
<i>The drug-related violence
that's plagued South Florida...</i>

1390
01:53:05,504 --> 01:53:07,797
He's good for a laugh, this guy.

1391
01:53:07,880 --> 01:53:11,841
<i>With a small law-enforcement
budget, how can you put a dent...</i>

1392
01:53:12,174 --> 01:53:16,759
<i>on an estimated
$100-billion-a-year business?</i>

1393
01:53:17,426 --> 01:53:19,302
<i>It seems at times all you can do...</i>

1394
01:53:19,385 --> 01:53:21,428
<i>is put your finger in the dike
and pray.</i>

1395
01:53:21,511 --> 01:53:23,345
Put your fingers in a dyke?

1396
01:53:23,678 --> 01:53:25,971
<i>The only place
you can get your fingers...</i>

1397
01:53:26,054 --> 01:53:27,431
is in some dyke.

1398
01:53:28,264 --> 01:53:33,057
<i>Not by outlawing the substances,
but by legalizing and taxing them.</i>

1399
01:53:33,390 --> 01:53:38,517
<i>These voices say that will drive out
the organized crime element.</i>

1400
01:53:39,184 --> 01:53:41,353
<i>I am not one of those voices.</i>

1401
01:53:41,436 --> 01:53:43,144
I know that. But you know why?

1402
01:53:43,228 --> 01:53:46,105
<i>'Cause you got your head
up your culo, that's why.</i>

1403
01:53:46,188 --> 01:53:48,481
That fucking guy,
he never tells the truth.

1404
01:53:48,564 --> 01:53:51,648
<i>... splendor of our city
at its best.</i>

1405
01:53:51,940 --> 01:53:53,607
It's those guys, man!

1406
01:53:53,690 --> 01:53:55,859
It's the fucking bankers,
the politicians...

1407
01:53:55,942 --> 01:53:58,234
they're the ones
that wanna make coke illegal!

1408
01:53:58,317 --> 01:54:01,735
<i>So they can make the fucking money,
and then get the fucking votes!</i>

1409
01:54:01,818 --> 01:54:04,946
They fighting the bad guys.
They're the bad guys!

1410
01:54:05,279 --> 01:54:07,155
They fuck anything and anyone.

1411
01:54:07,239 --> 01:54:10,323
Can't you stop saying "fuck"
all the time?

1412
01:54:10,490 --> 01:54:13,199
Can't you stop talking about money?
It's boring, Tony.

1413
01:54:13,282 --> 01:54:17,325
Where's this coming from?
Boring? What's boring?

1414
01:54:17,450 --> 01:54:18,993
You're boring.

1415
01:54:19,493 --> 01:54:22,702
"Money."
That's all I hear in this house.

1416
01:54:22,952 --> 01:54:25,954
Look at these pelicans fly.
Come on, pelicans!

1417
01:54:26,037 --> 01:54:28,748
- Here it is.
- Frank never talked about money.

1418
01:54:33,124 --> 01:54:35,583
That's 'cause he was so smart.

1419
01:54:42,835 --> 01:54:44,503
You know what you're becoming?

1420
01:54:44,628 --> 01:54:48,006
You're an immigrant spic millionaire
who can't stop talking...

1421
01:54:48,089 --> 01:54:51,422
Who the fuck you calling a "spic,"
you white piece of bread?

1422
01:54:51,547 --> 01:54:53,008
<i>Get out of the way of the TV!</i>

1423
01:54:53,091 --> 01:54:55,883
Dig a hole in the yard,
bury it, and forget about it.

1424
01:54:56,091 --> 01:54:59,343
I work hard for this!
I want you to know that.

1425
01:55:03,302 --> 01:55:07,221
Somebody should've given it to you.
You would've been a nicer person.

1426
01:55:09,347 --> 01:55:11,389
Know what your problem is, pussycat?

1427
01:55:11,472 --> 01:55:13,056
What is my problem?

1428
01:55:13,848 --> 01:55:16,307
You got nothing to do
with your life.

1429
01:55:17,434 --> 01:55:20,184
Why don't you get a job
or something?

1430
01:55:20,726 --> 01:55:22,602
Do something. Be a nurse.

1431
01:55:23,436 --> 01:55:26,312
Work with blind kids, lepers.
That kind of thing.

1432
01:55:27,772 --> 01:55:31,480
Anything beats lying around all day
waiting for me to fuck you!

1433
01:55:32,149 --> 01:55:34,607
Don't toot your horn, honey.
You're not that good.

1434
01:55:34,690 --> 01:55:36,858
No? Frank was better?

1435
01:55:38,108 --> 01:55:39,608
You're an asshole!

1436
01:55:40,483 --> 01:55:42,444
Where you going? Come here!

1437
01:55:43,111 --> 01:55:45,362
Elvie!

1438
01:55:46,112 --> 01:55:47,405
I was kidding!

1439
01:55:48,363 --> 01:55:50,072
I was only kidding!

1440
01:55:50,531 --> 01:55:54,740
I guess sometimes married life
is not all it's cracked up to be.

1441
01:55:55,032 --> 01:55:57,533
- Where you going?
- I got a date.

1442
01:55:58,450 --> 01:56:00,075
You got a date? Come here.

1443
01:56:05,202 --> 01:56:07,955
- What?
- This Seidelbaum thing.

1444
01:56:09,122 --> 01:56:10,705
Yeah, it's all set up.

1445
01:56:11,206 --> 01:56:13,040
Yeah, well, you forget it.

1446
01:56:13,206 --> 01:56:15,165
<i>Stay out of it.
I'll take care of it.</i>

1447
01:56:15,290 --> 01:56:18,000
Stay out of it? It's my deal.
I set it up.

1448
01:56:18,333 --> 01:56:20,667
You're not a negotiator,
Manny, you know that.

1449
01:56:20,751 --> 01:56:23,210
<i>You like the ladies
more than the money.</i>

1450
01:56:23,294 --> 01:56:24,335
That's your problem.

1451
01:56:24,419 --> 01:56:27,296
What the fuck are you talking about?
I'm your partner, okay?

1452
01:56:27,379 --> 01:56:29,754
If you don't trust me
with that kind of thing...

1453
01:56:29,879 --> 01:56:31,423
who're you gonna trust?

1454
01:56:31,506 --> 01:56:32,756
Junior partner.

1455
01:56:34,174 --> 01:56:35,299
Bullshit, man.

1456
01:56:35,382 --> 01:56:37,758
Don't talk to me about trust,
I don't like it.

1457
01:56:38,466 --> 01:56:40,926
You should listen to your wife.
She's right.

1458
01:56:41,009 --> 01:56:42,717
You are an asshole, man!

1459
01:56:43,678 --> 01:56:46,012
Come here. Give me a kiss.
Come here.

1460
01:56:47,220 --> 01:56:48,679
Fuck you, man!

1461
01:56:49,762 --> 01:56:53,264
Who put this thing together?
Me! That's who!

1462
01:56:54,472 --> 01:56:56,683
Who do I trust? Me!

1463
01:56:57,266 --> 01:56:59,224
Fuck him. "Trust."

1464
01:57:02,143 --> 01:57:05,228
Asshole. Fuck called me an asshole.

1465
01:57:06,145 --> 01:57:07,562
I need that shit.

1466
01:57:09,187 --> 01:57:10,730
I don't need him.

1467
01:57:11,730 --> 01:57:15,565
I don't need her. Fuck them.
I don't need nobody.

1468
01:57:16,648 --> 01:57:19,191
Back then I worked in pictures
down in Colombia.

1469
01:57:19,274 --> 01:57:22,069
<i>I was in that movie Burn.
You ever see it?</i>

1470
01:57:22,444 --> 01:57:25,945
You saw me with Marlon Brando?
You know, we're good friends.

1471
01:57:26,028 --> 01:57:28,404
- I was his driver.
- No shit?

1472
01:57:28,487 --> 01:57:32,197
- Brando.
- They shot it there. Cartagena.

1473
01:57:33,030 --> 01:57:34,906
Gillo Pontecorvo.
He was the director.

1474
01:57:34,989 --> 01:57:36,115
Italian guy.

1475
01:57:36,199 --> 01:57:39,908
- Tell me about him.
- I also know Paul Newman.

1476
01:57:40,325 --> 01:57:42,451
- I worked with him in Tucson.
- No kidding?

1477
01:57:42,534 --> 01:57:44,536
Do you know Benny Alvarez?

1478
01:57:44,661 --> 01:57:47,120
In Tucson. Benny Alvarez?

1479
01:57:47,495 --> 01:57:50,205
- Subtotal.
- No?

1480
01:57:52,955 --> 01:57:54,332
He's a nice guy.

1481
01:57:54,957 --> 01:57:58,958
$283,107.65.

1482
01:58:01,667 --> 01:58:03,669
You want a company cheque here?

1483
01:58:05,169 --> 01:58:09,129
I got $284,600.

1484
01:58:09,254 --> 01:58:12,672
That's just not possible.
The machine don't make mistakes.

1485
01:58:16,298 --> 01:58:18,424
- Let's count it again.
- No. Come on.

1486
01:58:18,507 --> 01:58:21,884
Business is business. Come on.
You're talking $1,500 here.

1487
01:58:22,969 --> 01:58:26,135
Okay, you keep the change.
Okay? I don't give a shit.

1488
01:58:27,845 --> 01:58:30,179
- I'll count it again for you.
- No, come on.

1489
01:58:30,262 --> 01:58:33,014
This cheque here,
where does this check go?

1490
01:58:36,473 --> 01:58:38,933
- Montana Realty Company.
- Montana what?

1491
01:58:39,391 --> 01:58:41,059
Montana Realty Company.

1492
01:58:41,226 --> 01:58:44,893
Montana Realty Company.

1493
01:58:45,143 --> 01:58:48,729
That's $284,000.
$284,600.

1494
01:58:49,687 --> 01:58:52,230
How come you don't know
Benny Alvarez?

1495
01:58:52,355 --> 01:58:56,814
Me and Benny have lunch together.
He probably knows me.

1496
01:58:57,358 --> 01:58:58,899
<i>You ask him.</i>

1497
01:59:16,906 --> 01:59:18,531
We're up to what?

1498
01:59:20,032 --> 01:59:26,119
Seven cheques. $1,325,623.

1499
01:59:28,953 --> 01:59:31,036
$200,000 more.

1500
01:59:31,120 --> 01:59:33,330
- We ought to take a leak.
- Freeze!

1501
01:59:33,413 --> 01:59:34,705
Get your hands up!

1502
01:59:34,830 --> 01:59:36,373
Go against the wall, turn around.

1503
01:59:36,456 --> 01:59:37,456
You're not kidding.

1504
01:59:37,581 --> 01:59:40,791
You're under arrest
for violation of the RICO Statute.

1505
01:59:40,875 --> 01:59:42,542
"You have the right
to remain silent.

1506
01:59:42,626 --> 01:59:45,209
"Anything you say
can and will be taken against you."

1507
01:59:45,292 --> 01:59:48,794
How do I know you guys are cops?
What's that say, asshole?

1508
01:59:50,212 --> 01:59:53,213
That's pretty good, man.
Where'd you get that?

1509
01:59:53,338 --> 01:59:56,672
You call yourself a Cuban?
You make a real Cuban throw up!

1510
01:59:56,797 --> 01:59:58,966
Call your dog off me, Seidelbaum.

1511
01:59:59,341 --> 02:00:02,509
I want to call my lawyer.
Lot of good he'll do.

1512
02:00:02,634 --> 02:00:04,925
You see that eye there in the clock?

1513
02:00:05,259 --> 02:00:07,219
<i>Say, "Hi, honey."</i>

1514
02:00:07,844 --> 02:00:10,302
<i>That's pretty cute. Look at that.</i>

1515
02:00:10,388 --> 02:00:12,596
<i>You jerk off in front of us,
Seidelbaum?</i>

1516
02:00:12,679 --> 02:00:15,013
<i>I was supposed to meet this
chick at 3:00.</i>

1517
02:00:15,138 --> 02:00:16,973
<i>You're a fucking pain in the ass.</i>

1518
02:00:17,265 --> 02:00:19,099
<i>All right, Benny, kill it.</i>

1519
02:00:20,057 --> 02:00:22,558
You understand the rights
I've given you?

1520
02:00:22,725 --> 02:00:24,893
I know all that bullshit,
Seidelbaum!

1521
02:00:25,019 --> 02:00:26,394
Save your breath.

1522
02:00:26,644 --> 02:00:29,435
You got nothing on me.
You know it. I know it.

1523
02:00:29,895 --> 02:00:32,270
I'm changing dollar bills,
that's all.

1524
02:00:32,645 --> 02:00:35,981
You want to waste my time?
Okay. I call my lawyer.

1525
02:00:36,731 --> 02:00:40,608
He's the best lawyer in Miami.
He's such a good lawyer...

1526
02:00:41,191 --> 02:00:44,985
that by tomorrow morning,
you gonna be working in Alaska.

1527
02:00:46,693 --> 02:00:48,027
So dress warm.

1528
02:00:52,320 --> 02:00:56,196
Give me a cheque
for $100,000, plus $300,000 in cash.

1529
02:00:56,864 --> 02:00:59,574
I guarantee you walk
on the conspiracy charge.

1530
02:01:00,450 --> 02:01:03,450
They're gonna come back at us
on a tax evasion...

1531
02:01:04,535 --> 02:01:06,326
and they'll get it.

1532
02:01:10,203 --> 02:01:12,537
So, what am I looking at here?

1533
02:01:14,829 --> 02:01:17,039
Five years. You'll be out in three.

1534
02:01:17,122 --> 02:01:19,791
<i>Maybe less, if I can make a deal.</i>

1535
02:01:21,457 --> 02:01:22,957
Three fucking years!

1536
02:01:25,334 --> 02:01:26,668
For what?

1537
02:01:27,710 --> 02:01:31,170
Washing money? The fucking country
was built on washed money.

1538
02:01:31,253 --> 02:01:32,670
Can't be that bad.

1539
02:01:32,753 --> 02:01:35,212
- It's not like Cuba.
- What the fuck you talking?

1540
02:01:35,296 --> 02:01:38,465
- The jails are like hotels.
- You kidding me or what?

1541
02:01:38,590 --> 02:01:41,424
You fucking high?
I'll delay the trial.

1542
02:01:41,715 --> 02:01:44,801
A year and a half, two years.
You won't even start...

1543
02:01:44,842 --> 02:01:46,009
Fuck you, man!

1544
02:01:46,092 --> 02:01:48,094
I'm not going back
in any cage, okay?

1545
02:01:48,178 --> 02:01:50,011
<i>No way. I been there.</i>

1546
02:01:55,639 --> 02:01:57,014
Okay, look.

1547
02:01:59,307 --> 02:02:03,517
I give you $400,000 more.
Okay, now that's $800,000.

1548
02:02:04,017 --> 02:02:07,184
With that kind of money,
you can buy the Supreme Court.

1549
02:02:09,851 --> 02:02:13,271
Tony, the law has to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt.

1550
02:02:14,229 --> 02:02:18,398
I'm an expert at raising that doubt.
But when you got $1,300,000...

1551
02:02:18,523 --> 02:02:21,732
undeclared
staring into a videotape camera...

1552
02:02:22,400 --> 02:02:26,400
honey baby, it's hard to convince
a jury you found it in a taxicab.

1553
02:02:49,993 --> 02:02:52,536
I'm so glad you could come
on such short notice.

1554
02:02:52,619 --> 02:02:53,744
I really appreciate it.

1555
02:02:53,828 --> 02:02:55,579
- It's okay.
- How's Elvira?

1556
02:02:55,830 --> 02:02:58,914
- Great. How's your wife?
- Three more months.

1557
02:02:59,081 --> 02:03:01,541
- Yeah? Congratulations.
- How about you?

1558
02:03:01,624 --> 02:03:04,333
When you gonna have another Tony
to take your place?

1559
02:03:04,416 --> 02:03:07,418
- I'm working on it.
- You have to work harder. Come.

1560
02:03:07,585 --> 02:03:09,960
<i>I want you to meet
some of my friends.</i>

1561
02:03:14,879 --> 02:03:16,172
This is Pedro Quinn...

1562
02:03:16,255 --> 02:03:18,255
chairman of
the Andes Sugar Corporation.

1563
02:03:18,380 --> 02:03:20,839
- Pleasure meeting you.
- Nice to meet you.

1564
02:03:20,923 --> 02:03:24,299
General Edward Strasser,
Commander of the First Army Corps.

1565
02:03:25,843 --> 02:03:27,009
Pleasure.

1566
02:03:27,093 --> 02:03:29,134
This is Ariel Bleyer...

1567
02:03:29,259 --> 02:03:32,178
with the Ministry of the Interior.
Tony Montana.

1568
02:03:34,346 --> 02:03:38,263
And here is our friend
Charles Goodson from Washington.

1569
02:03:38,597 --> 02:03:41,224
- Nice to meet you.
- How do you do, Mr. Montana?

1570
02:03:42,265 --> 02:03:43,765
Sit here, Tony.

1571
02:03:47,558 --> 02:03:48,808
<i>Gentlemen.</i>

1572
02:03:52,770 --> 02:03:54,687
I would like to discuss something...

1573
02:03:54,770 --> 02:03:56,771
that is of interest
to all of us here.

1574
02:03:58,064 --> 02:03:59,814
You have a problem, Tony.

1575
02:04:00,607 --> 02:04:03,857
We have a problem.

1576
02:04:05,024 --> 02:04:07,775
I think together
we can solve all our problems.

1577
02:04:10,026 --> 02:04:12,569
<i>We all know you have tax troubles
in your country...</i>

1578
02:04:12,652 --> 02:04:15,363
<i>and that you may have to do
a little time.</i>

1579
02:04:16,030 --> 02:04:17,572
<i>We have friends in Washington...</i>

1580
02:04:17,655 --> 02:04:20,698
that assure us these troubles
can be taken care of.

1581
02:04:20,823 --> 02:04:24,323
You may have to pay some back taxes,
a big fine...

1582
02:04:25,158 --> 02:04:27,242
but there will be no prison.

1583
02:04:27,908 --> 02:04:28,950
Okay.

1584
02:04:29,826 --> 02:04:31,785
So what's your problem, Alex?

1585
02:04:32,827 --> 02:04:34,662
I'll show you my problem.

1586
02:04:35,204 --> 02:04:36,954
<i>I've heard about financial...</i>

1587
02:04:37,037 --> 02:04:38,371
<i>support the government receives...</i>

1588
02:04:38,454 --> 02:04:40,289
<i>from the drug industry in Bolivia.</i>

1589
02:04:40,373 --> 02:04:43,665
<i>Well, the irony of this
is that this money...</i>

1590
02:04:43,749 --> 02:04:45,291
<i>which is in the billions...</i>

1591
02:04:45,500 --> 02:04:47,250
<i>is coming from your country.</i>

1592
02:04:47,333 --> 02:04:51,209
<i>You are the major purchaser
of our national product...</i>

1593
02:04:51,294 --> 02:04:53,086
<i>which is cocaine.</i>

1594
02:04:53,169 --> 02:04:55,379
<i>You're saying
the U.S. Government...</i>

1595
02:04:55,504 --> 02:04:59,755
<i>is spending millions to eliminate
the flow of drugs onto our streets.</i>

1596
02:05:00,046 --> 02:05:01,714
<i>At the same time...</i>

1597
02:05:01,797 --> 02:05:04,674
<i>we are doing business
with the same government...</i>

1598
02:05:04,883 --> 02:05:07,383
<i>that is flooding our streets
with cocaine.</i>

1599
02:05:07,716 --> 02:05:10,301
<i>Let me show you
a few of the other characters...</i>

1600
02:05:10,385 --> 02:05:12,636
<i>that are involved
in this tragic comedy.</i>

1601
02:05:12,719 --> 02:05:18,013
<i>My organization just recently traced
a large purchase by this man.</i>

1602
02:05:18,680 --> 02:05:22,305
<i>This charming face here
belongs to General Cucombre.</i>

1603
02:05:22,597 --> 02:05:25,806
<i>He is the Minister of the Defense
of Bolivia, my country.</i>

1604
02:05:26,348 --> 02:05:28,726
<i>And General Cucombre just
a couple months ago...</i>

1605
02:05:28,851 --> 02:05:33,186
<i>bought a $12 million villa
on Lake Lucerne in Switzerland.</i>

1606
02:05:33,270 --> 02:05:36,646
<i>Now, if Cucombre is supposed to be
the Bolivian Defense Minister...</i>

1607
02:05:36,729 --> 02:05:38,980
<i>what is he doing
living in Switzerland?</i>

1608
02:05:39,063 --> 02:05:40,563
<i>Guarding cash registers?</i>

1609
02:05:41,647 --> 02:05:45,982
<i>This man here, Alejandro Sosa,
a very interesting character.</i>

1610
02:05:46,232 --> 02:05:47,900
<i>He's a wealthy landowner...</i>

1611
02:05:47,983 --> 02:05:50,609
<i>educated in England,
very good family.</i>

1612
02:05:50,901 --> 02:05:54,862
<i>But this man is the business brain
and drug overlord...</i>

1613
02:05:55,070 --> 02:05:57,863
<i>of an empire that stretches
across the Andes.</i>

1614
02:05:57,946 --> 02:06:00,446
<i>He's not your ordinary drug dealer.</i>

1615
02:06:01,071 --> 02:06:03,698
<i>Well, discussing it openly...</i>

1616
02:06:04,823 --> 02:06:07,283
<i>He's scheduled for 60 Minutes next.</i>

1617
02:06:07,866 --> 02:06:13,411
He is going on French, British,
Italian, Japanese television.

1618
02:06:13,994 --> 02:06:16,913
People everywhere
are starting to listen to him.

1619
02:06:17,371 --> 02:06:19,079
It's embarrassing, Tony.

1620
02:06:21,289 --> 02:06:23,581
That is our problem.

1621
02:06:26,248 --> 02:06:28,457
You remember Alberto, don't you?

1622
02:06:29,834 --> 02:06:31,502
How could I forget him?

1623
02:06:32,252 --> 02:06:35,585
Alberto is an expert
in the disposal business.

1624
02:06:36,628 --> 02:06:39,004
He's going to help us
fix our problem.

1625
02:06:40,796 --> 02:06:42,714
But he doesn't speak English.

1626
02:06:43,464 --> 02:06:46,465
He doesn't know his way
around the States too well.

1627
02:06:46,716 --> 02:06:48,676
He needs a little help.

1628
02:06:50,884 --> 02:06:52,802
Is that a problem, Tony?

1629
02:06:58,720 --> 02:07:00,387
No problem.

1630
02:07:02,888 --> 02:07:04,055
Good.

1631
02:07:19,312 --> 02:07:23,314
So what's the big mystery
with the Bolivian situation?

1632
02:07:23,689 --> 02:07:26,690
You gonna tell me what happened
with Sosa, or what?

1633
02:07:26,898 --> 02:07:30,109
A lot of bullshit,
that's what happened.

1634
02:07:31,026 --> 02:07:32,194
Politics.

1635
02:07:36,986 --> 02:07:40,238
I want you to stay down here
for a while.

1636
02:07:41,488 --> 02:07:43,197
Run things for me.

1637
02:07:43,947 --> 02:07:46,114
I gotta go to New York next week.

1638
02:07:52,492 --> 02:07:53,742
Fuck this, man.

1639
02:07:53,867 --> 02:07:56,786
I don't like it, man.
I don't like this at all.

1640
02:07:56,869 --> 02:07:58,537
You don't like it?

1641
02:08:01,580 --> 02:08:04,872
You got me into this mess
in the first place.

1642
02:08:04,956 --> 02:08:08,666
With that fucking Seidelbaum,
that right?

1643
02:08:08,749 --> 02:08:10,125
With Seidelbaum?

1644
02:08:10,209 --> 02:08:12,417
What does Seidelbaum
have to do with Sosa?

1645
02:08:12,500 --> 02:08:15,251
How do you connect those two?

1646
02:08:15,711 --> 02:08:18,252
Why don't you eat your food?
What's wrong with it?

1647
02:08:18,336 --> 02:08:20,379
I'm not hungry.

1648
02:08:21,046 --> 02:08:24,089
You're not hungry?
Do you know about the trial?

1649
02:08:24,214 --> 02:08:28,341
- What did you order it for, then?
- I lost my appetite.

1650
02:08:33,510 --> 02:08:37,344
Do you even know that Sheffield said
he can get you a postponement?

1651
02:08:44,723 --> 02:08:48,933
Is this it?
That's what it's all about?

1652
02:08:52,142 --> 02:08:55,518
Eating, drinking...

1653
02:08:56,060 --> 02:08:58,228
fucking, sucking...

1654
02:08:58,311 --> 02:09:01,062
- Come on, man.
- Snorting?

1655
02:09:01,145 --> 02:09:02,312
Then what?

1656
02:09:03,896 --> 02:09:05,731
Tell me. Then what?

1657
02:09:06,731 --> 02:09:11,234
You're 50.
You got a bag for a belly.

1658
02:09:12,651 --> 02:09:15,401
You got tits, you need a bra.

1659
02:09:16,276 --> 02:09:17,820
They got hair on them.

1660
02:09:19,028 --> 02:09:22,404
You got a liver,
and they got spots on it...

1661
02:09:22,529 --> 02:09:24,529
and you're eating
this fucking shit...

1662
02:09:25,030 --> 02:09:28,574
and you're looking like
these rich fucking mummies in here.

1663
02:09:28,782 --> 02:09:31,532
Come on. It's not so bad.
It could be worse.

1664
02:09:32,201 --> 02:09:34,701
- Is this what it's all about?
- Forget it.

1665
02:09:34,868 --> 02:09:37,870
This what I work for? Tell me.

1666
02:09:43,412 --> 02:09:44,664
Look at that.

1667
02:09:45,748 --> 02:09:47,082
A junkie.

1668
02:09:48,874 --> 02:09:53,208
I got a fucking junkie for a wife.
She don't eat nothing.

1669
02:09:54,417 --> 02:09:58,128
Sleeps all day
with them black shades on.

1670
02:09:59,836 --> 02:10:02,546
- Wakes up with a Quaalude...
- Don't pick on her, man.

1671
02:10:02,630 --> 02:10:06,297
...and who won't fuck me
'cause she's in a coma.

1672
02:10:08,007 --> 02:10:10,423
I can't even have a kid with her.

1673
02:10:10,548 --> 02:10:13,259
Her womb is so polluted...

1674
02:10:13,342 --> 02:10:16,343
I can't even have
a fucking little baby with her!

1675
02:10:16,426 --> 02:10:18,760
You son of a bitch!

1676
02:10:19,718 --> 02:10:21,346
You fuck!

1677
02:10:21,763 --> 02:10:25,430
- You shouldn't talk like that.
- How dare you talk to me like that!

1678
02:10:26,765 --> 02:10:29,141
What makes you
so much better than me?

1679
02:10:29,516 --> 02:10:30,892
- What do you do?
- Don't worry.

1680
02:10:30,975 --> 02:10:34,517
You deal drugs and you kill people.
That's wonderful, Tony.

1681
02:10:35,225 --> 02:10:37,559
Real contribution to human history.

1682
02:10:37,685 --> 02:10:40,477
- Go ahead. Tell everybody.
- You want a kid?

1683
02:10:40,561 --> 02:10:41,895
Tell the world.

1684
02:10:41,978 --> 02:10:44,854
What kind of a father
would you make?

1685
02:10:46,231 --> 02:10:48,690
Gonna drive him to school
in the mornings?

1686
02:10:48,815 --> 02:10:52,358
Are you even gonna be alive
by the time the kid goes to school?

1687
02:10:53,900 --> 02:10:56,902
- You don't know how to be a husband!
- Sit down before I...

1688
02:10:56,985 --> 02:10:59,443
Do we ever go anywhere
without having 600 thugs...

1689
02:10:59,527 --> 02:11:01,236
hanging around all the time?

1690
02:11:01,611 --> 02:11:05,364
I have Nick "The Pig" as a friend.

1691
02:11:06,822 --> 02:11:09,866
What kind of life is that?

1692
02:11:14,325 --> 02:11:15,785
Can't you see...

1693
02:11:18,160 --> 02:11:20,827
what we're becoming, Tony?
We're losers.

1694
02:11:21,786 --> 02:11:24,079
<i>We're not winners, we're losers.</i>

1695
02:11:25,080 --> 02:11:29,122
- Go home. You're stoned.
- I'm not stoned, you're stoned.

1696
02:11:29,373 --> 02:11:31,749
- Get her out of here.
- Come on.

1697
02:11:34,166 --> 02:11:36,001
I'm not going home with you.

1698
02:11:37,543 --> 02:11:39,627
I'm not going home with anybody.

1699
02:11:41,461 --> 02:11:43,004
I'm going home alone.

1700
02:11:48,672 --> 02:11:50,007
I'm leaving you.

1701
02:11:52,549 --> 02:11:54,550
I don't need this shit anymore.

1702
02:11:55,008 --> 02:11:58,092
Okay, but I'll walk you out.
I'll take her home in a cab.

1703
02:11:58,176 --> 02:12:00,428
Let her go.

1704
02:12:01,011 --> 02:12:03,888
Another Quaalude,
she gonna love me again.

1705
02:12:11,473 --> 02:12:13,057
What're you looking at?

1706
02:12:19,976 --> 02:12:22,352
You're all a bunch
of fucking assholes.

1707
02:12:23,729 --> 02:12:25,189
You know why?

1708
02:12:27,064 --> 02:12:30,315
You don't have the guts
to be what you want to be.

1709
02:12:33,900 --> 02:12:36,192
You need people like me.

1710
02:12:41,902 --> 02:12:43,446
You need people like me...

1711
02:12:43,529 --> 02:12:46,237
so you can point
your fucking fingers...

1712
02:12:46,821 --> 02:12:49,114
and say, "That's the bad guy."

1713
02:12:52,115 --> 02:12:53,241
So...

1714
02:12:54,200 --> 02:12:55,866
what does that make you?

1715
02:12:56,450 --> 02:12:57,492
Good?

1716
02:13:00,369 --> 02:13:02,119
You're not good.

1717
02:13:04,329 --> 02:13:06,245
You just know how to hide...

1718
02:13:07,955 --> 02:13:09,247
how to lie.

1719
02:13:11,914 --> 02:13:15,333
Me, I don't have that problem.

1720
02:13:17,084 --> 02:13:20,252
Me, I always tell the truth.

1721
02:13:22,003 --> 02:13:23,670
Even when I lie.

1722
02:13:32,840 --> 02:13:35,424
So say good night to the bad guy!

1723
02:13:36,049 --> 02:13:37,301
Come on.

1724
02:13:39,510 --> 02:13:42,386
The last time you gonna see
a bad guy like this again...

1725
02:13:42,470 --> 02:13:43,845
let me tell you.

1726
02:13:45,054 --> 02:13:48,388
Come on. Make way for the bad guy.

1727
02:13:49,847 --> 02:13:52,348
<i>There's a bad guy coming through!</i>

1728
02:13:53,099 --> 02:13:54,765
<i>Better get out of his way!</i>

1729
02:13:58,016 --> 02:14:02,187
NEW YORK CITY

1730
02:15:22,302 --> 02:15:26,012
No. You tell Sheffield to keep
his nose out of it.

1731
02:15:26,220 --> 02:15:29,513
<i>There's gonna be no trial.
I got it all under control now.</i>

1732
02:15:29,971 --> 02:15:32,055
<i>Just tell him to stay out of it!</i>

1733
02:15:32,597 --> 02:15:35,015
<i>Okay, what about Elvira?
Did she call?</i>

1734
02:15:38,391 --> 02:15:39,769
Yeah, all right.

1735
02:15:55,273 --> 02:15:56,982
Tony, everything go okay?

1736
02:15:57,357 --> 02:15:59,151
Yeah, everything is roses.

1737
02:16:02,986 --> 02:16:04,653
Ernie, what time do you got?

1738
02:16:04,986 --> 02:16:07,612
- Ten to.
- Ten to.

1739
02:16:07,905 --> 02:16:09,863
- Where is this guy?
- I gotta call Manny.

1740
02:16:11,071 --> 02:16:12,071
Sit down.

1741
02:16:12,238 --> 02:16:13,781
You don't tell me what to do here!

1742
02:16:13,864 --> 02:16:16,116
He's coming out.
He's coming.

1743
02:16:17,491 --> 02:16:19,825
- I don't give a fuck.
- It's him, man.

1744
02:16:22,576 --> 02:16:25,244
We do it
in front of the United Nations.

1745
02:16:25,369 --> 02:16:27,244
That's how they want it.

1746
02:16:27,371 --> 02:16:29,579
I don't care where you blow him up.

1747
02:16:30,163 --> 02:16:31,704
<i>Tell me when, okay?</i>

1748
02:16:33,498 --> 02:16:36,291
<i>You just tell me when.
That's all I care about.</i>

1749
02:16:40,292 --> 02:16:43,960
I want you to stay thirty meters
behind the car, okay?

1750
02:16:44,835 --> 02:16:46,502
Thirty meters. No more.

1751
02:16:46,585 --> 02:16:48,711
I heard you the first time.

1752
02:16:48,795 --> 02:16:50,670
One time.
That's all you gotta tell me.

1753
02:16:51,881 --> 02:16:53,923
I told you thirty meters.

1754
02:16:54,965 --> 02:16:57,175
This fucking guy, I'm telling you.

1755
02:16:59,801 --> 02:17:01,509
Look. Here he comes.

1756
02:17:04,427 --> 02:17:06,511
Where's he going?

1757
02:17:06,761 --> 02:17:08,470
<i>What's he doing that way?</i>

1758
02:17:19,892 --> 02:17:21,518
What the fuck he doing?

1759
02:17:35,356 --> 02:17:37,441
What the fuck is that? Come here.

1760
02:17:37,524 --> 02:17:39,607
You said she took the kids
in the other car!

1761
02:17:39,691 --> 02:17:43,568
She did, every fucking day.
I don't know what's going on.

1762
02:17:45,736 --> 02:17:49,236
No fucking way.
No fucking way. That's it!

1763
02:17:50,654 --> 02:17:52,029
Forget it!

1764
02:17:52,612 --> 02:17:56,657
We kill this guy alone.
No wife, no kids.

1765
02:17:57,407 --> 02:18:01,826
No way. If Sosa says we do it now,
we do it now. Let's go.

1766
02:18:02,451 --> 02:18:04,409
This fucking guy.

1767
02:18:34,339 --> 02:18:37,131
Okay, just stay behind him.

1768
02:18:38,507 --> 02:18:41,425
Slowly, slowly.

1769
02:18:41,633 --> 02:18:43,217
Fuck you, you fucking vulture.

1770
02:18:44,468 --> 02:18:46,009
Okay. Easy.

1771
02:18:47,760 --> 02:18:51,804
Two little kids in the car.
This is so fucking bad.

1772
02:18:52,679 --> 02:18:54,223
<i>This is so fucking bad.</i>

1773
02:18:55,515 --> 02:18:58,432
You're losing them. Look!
You're losing them!

1774
02:18:58,557 --> 02:19:00,391
I see them, all right? I see them!

1775
02:19:01,683 --> 02:19:03,977
Ten meters, ten meters!

1776
02:19:04,352 --> 02:19:06,268
Move it. Move it!

1777
02:19:06,352 --> 02:19:08,060
Shut the fuck up, okay?

1778
02:19:20,566 --> 02:19:24,235
You don't have the guts to look them
in the eye when you kill them.

1779
02:19:24,401 --> 02:19:25,901
You gotta hide with that shit...

1780
02:19:25,985 --> 02:19:26,985
Shut your mouth.

1781
02:19:27,110 --> 02:19:28,819
He's getting up. Let's do it.

1782
02:19:28,902 --> 02:19:30,486
Make you feel good?

1783
02:19:31,029 --> 02:19:34,030
Make you feel good to kill a mama
and her kids. Make you feel big.

1784
02:19:35,239 --> 02:19:36,280
Shut your mouth!

1785
02:19:36,364 --> 02:19:37,822
Like you, big man! Fuck you!

1786
02:19:38,490 --> 02:19:39,907
<i>What do you think I am?</i>

1787
02:19:39,991 --> 02:19:42,157
You think I kill two kids
and a woman?

1788
02:19:42,324 --> 02:19:45,743
Fuck that!
I don't need that shit in my life!

1789
02:19:48,119 --> 02:19:50,078
You die, motherfucker!

1790
02:19:54,997 --> 02:19:56,455
What do you think I am?

1791
02:19:56,538 --> 02:19:58,707
You think I'm a fucking worm
like you?

1792
02:19:59,040 --> 02:20:02,541
I told you, man!
I told you, don't fuck with me!

1793
02:20:02,750 --> 02:20:05,083
I told you, no fucking kids!

1794
02:20:05,208 --> 02:20:09,294
No, but you wouldn't listen!
You stupid fuck! Look at you now.

1795
02:20:14,796 --> 02:20:17,132
Nick, where the fuck you been?

1796
02:20:18,382 --> 02:20:19,798
<i>On a delivery?</i>

1797
02:20:20,632 --> 02:20:22,591
Where the hell is Manny?

1798
02:20:22,674 --> 02:20:24,550
I been calling all over.
Where is he?

1799
02:20:24,634 --> 02:20:27,051
I don't know, Tony.

1800
02:20:27,135 --> 02:20:28,968
He's been gone
the last couple of days.

1801
02:20:29,051 --> 02:20:31,552
<i>He didn't say nothing.
He's gone? Where?</i>

1802
02:20:31,638 --> 02:20:35,555
I left him in fucking charge, man!
Where the fuck is he?

1803
02:20:35,680 --> 02:20:37,973
You can't trust nobody anymore!

1804
02:20:38,098 --> 02:20:41,516
I don't know, Tony.
He just took off.

1805
02:20:41,599 --> 02:20:43,850
<i>He didn't say nothing.
He took off?</i>

1806
02:20:44,642 --> 02:20:48,018
<i>Are you all right?
No, I'm not! I'm pissed!</i>

1807
02:20:48,101 --> 02:20:49,269
When I get back there...

1808
02:20:49,394 --> 02:20:51,437
I'll kick some ass
all over the place!

1809
02:20:51,521 --> 02:20:54,271
<i>When you coming back?
I'm coming back tonight!</i>

1810
02:20:54,646 --> 02:20:56,689
This fucking cocksucker.

1811
02:20:57,314 --> 02:21:01,900
Tony, your mama called. Gina's gone.

1812
02:21:03,525 --> 02:21:06,734
<i>Gone? Where?
She got to see you right away.</i>

1813
02:21:06,817 --> 02:21:10,528
Tell her I'll call her tonight.

1814
02:21:10,737 --> 02:21:13,904
Listen to me.
What about Elvie? She call?

1815
02:21:14,029 --> 02:21:16,321
<i>No.
No.</i>

1816
02:21:16,405 --> 02:21:18,156
Okay, listen to me.

1817
02:21:18,239 --> 02:21:20,616
If she calls,
just tell her I love her.

1818
02:21:20,699 --> 02:21:22,824
Okay? Just tell her that.

1819
02:21:46,626 --> 02:21:48,460
You hear from Manny?
No.

1820
02:21:48,544 --> 02:21:50,420
Your mama called, she gotta see you.

1821
02:21:50,503 --> 02:21:54,629
Sosa's been ringing every half hour.
He sounds pissed.

1822
02:21:54,713 --> 02:21:57,505
Get him on the phone. Elvie call?
No.

1823
02:22:00,548 --> 02:22:03,507
You keep trying Manny.
I want that cocksucker here.

1824
02:22:03,632 --> 02:22:05,800
- I want him here now! Okay?
- Okay.

1825
02:22:05,925 --> 02:22:09,092
Come on. Go ahead, get him!
Let's go. Come on!

1826
02:22:23,765 --> 02:22:28,226
Yeah? Mama. Yeah, I know.

1827
02:22:29,144 --> 02:22:31,769
They told me.

1828
02:22:31,811 --> 02:22:33,771
Okay. I'm coming over.

1829
02:22:33,854 --> 02:22:36,729
I'll be over to see you.
I'll be over, yeah.

1830
02:22:40,856 --> 02:22:42,815
Put it on the speaker.

1831
02:22:52,860 --> 02:22:54,987
<i>What happened, Tony?</i>

1832
02:22:55,946 --> 02:22:58,864
<i>Alex, how you doing?
What happened?</i>

1833
02:22:59,198 --> 02:23:01,573
We had some problems.

1834
02:23:03,825 --> 02:23:06,201
<i>Alex?
Tony, what happened?</i>

1835
02:23:09,743 --> 02:23:11,993
<i>We had a little problem.
I heard.</i>

1836
02:23:12,077 --> 02:23:13,245
How you hear that?

1837
02:23:13,329 --> 02:23:15,495
Our friend gave a speech at the UN.

1838
02:23:15,620 --> 02:23:18,538
He was not supposed to give
that speech.

1839
02:23:20,788 --> 02:23:24,124
Well, your guy, Alberto,
he's a piece of shit.

1840
02:23:24,208 --> 02:23:26,459
I told him to do something,
he didn't listen...

1841
02:23:26,584 --> 02:23:28,043
so I cancelled his contract.

1842
02:23:28,126 --> 02:23:30,627
My partners and I are pissed off.

1843
02:23:31,169 --> 02:23:32,962
That's okay. No big deal.

1844
02:23:33,170 --> 02:23:36,212
There's other Albertos.
We'll do it next month.

1845
02:23:36,295 --> 02:23:38,338
No, Tony, you can't do that.

1846
02:23:39,046 --> 02:23:42,047
They found what was under the car.

1847
02:23:42,923 --> 02:23:45,591
Now our friend has got security
up the ass.

1848
02:23:45,882 --> 02:23:49,427
<i>The heat will come down hard
on my partners and me.</i>

1849
02:23:50,219 --> 02:23:52,178
There's not gonna be a next time...

1850
02:23:52,261 --> 02:23:55,970
<i>- you dumb cocksucker! You blew it!
- Take it easy when you talk to me.</i>

1851
02:23:56,136 --> 02:24:00,972
I told you a long time ago,
you fucking monkey, not to fuck me!

1852
02:24:01,055 --> 02:24:03,014
Who the fuck
you think you're talking to?

1853
02:24:03,098 --> 02:24:04,265
<i>You want to fuck with...</i>

1854
02:24:04,349 --> 02:24:07,726
Who the fuck you think I am,
your fucking bellboy?

1855
02:24:08,726 --> 02:24:12,269
You want to go to war?
We take you to war, okay?

1856
02:24:13,394 --> 02:24:15,770
Alex, you there? Hey!

1857
02:24:15,979 --> 02:24:19,438
<i>He's not there. Cálmate, man.</i>

1858
02:24:20,813 --> 02:24:24,691
She got a place of her own.
She don't tell me where.

1859
02:24:24,941 --> 02:24:27,275
One night, I follow her in a taxi.

1860
02:24:27,400 --> 02:24:30,109
She goes to a fancy house
in Coconut Grove.

1861
02:24:31,151 --> 02:24:32,902
- Where'd she get the money?
- You!

1862
02:24:32,986 --> 02:24:35,988
You were giving her the money!
You see what you do to her?

1863
02:24:36,113 --> 02:24:38,488
- I don't give her that much money.
- You did!

1864
02:24:38,571 --> 02:24:41,698
- One time, $1,000 you gave her.
- Was a guy with her?

1865
02:24:42,406 --> 02:24:44,366
I don't know.

1866
02:24:44,657 --> 02:24:46,867
There was this car in the driveway.

1867
02:24:46,950 --> 02:24:48,700
I know if I go there,
she'll kill me.

1868
02:24:48,783 --> 02:24:51,494
- She's like you.
- Where's the place? Where is it?

1869
02:24:51,702 --> 02:24:54,702
400 something...

1870
02:24:54,785 --> 02:24:55,953
Citrus Drive.

1871
02:24:56,036 --> 02:24:58,453
- 400 what?
- 409, I think.

1872
02:24:58,703 --> 02:25:01,873
You gotta talk to her, Antonio.
She don't listen to me.

1873
02:25:01,956 --> 02:25:03,790
<i>She says to me, "Mira, shut up!</i>

1874
02:25:03,915 --> 02:25:05,124
"Mind your own business."

1875
02:25:05,208 --> 02:25:07,083
Exactly like you do to me.

1876
02:25:07,166 --> 02:25:10,001
Ever since you came back,
she's been getting this way.

1877
02:25:10,127 --> 02:25:12,793
- I gotta go.
- Why do you have to hurt everything?

1878
02:25:12,877 --> 02:25:14,918
Why do you have to destroy...

1879
02:25:15,003 --> 02:25:17,295
everything that comes your way?

1880
02:25:21,338 --> 02:25:23,839
409 Citrus Drive.

1881
02:25:24,131 --> 02:25:27,259
- Tony, I can't find Manny anywhere.
- Fuck!

1882
02:25:27,717 --> 02:25:30,510
Okay. Listen, boss, I'll try again.

1883
02:26:03,481 --> 02:26:06,774
You stay here.
Keep trying Manny, okay?

1884
02:28:06,282 --> 02:28:10,866
We got married just yesterday.
We were gonna surprise you.

1885
02:28:16,619 --> 02:28:18,119
Jesus, Tony.

1886
02:28:18,579 --> 02:28:22,038
Tony, we gotta get outta here, man.
We gotta get outta here.

1887
02:28:22,580 --> 02:28:24,247
Go get Gina.

1888
02:28:32,500 --> 02:28:33,584
No!

1889
02:28:40,296 --> 02:28:43,214
No, Gina. Come on, Gina. No!

1890
02:28:43,297 --> 02:28:44,964
God!

1891
02:28:53,258 --> 02:28:54,968
Tony, we can't stay here.
We gotta go.

1892
02:28:55,093 --> 02:28:56,968
We gotta get out of here.

1893
02:29:36,819 --> 02:29:38,194
Come on, Gina.

1894
02:29:41,820 --> 02:29:44,072
Here we go. It's gonna be okay.

1895
02:29:44,197 --> 02:29:46,280
- You got her?
- I got her.

1896
02:30:13,666 --> 02:30:17,501
No! This is Tony's place! Let me go!

1897
02:31:02,520 --> 02:31:05,437
We put some pills into her.
She's gonna be all right, Tony.

1898
02:31:05,521 --> 02:31:07,231
She's cooling down. Right?

1899
02:31:07,314 --> 02:31:10,273
- She's gonna be fine. Just fine.
- Right.

1900
02:31:12,858 --> 02:31:14,692
What are we gonna do now?

1901
02:31:19,193 --> 02:31:20,360
Do?

1902
02:31:25,237 --> 02:31:26,863
We're going to war.

1903
02:31:28,071 --> 02:31:30,281
<i>That's what we're gonna do.</i>

1904
02:31:33,825 --> 02:31:36,910
We're gonna eat that Sosa
for breakfast!

1905
02:31:39,202 --> 02:31:41,870
Close that fucker down.

1906
02:31:47,746 --> 02:31:49,789
Tony, take it easy.

1907
02:31:57,502 --> 02:32:00,836
All right, Ernie. Let's go.
We'll take care of the house.

1908
02:33:11,865 --> 02:33:13,741
Come on.

1909
02:33:13,825 --> 02:33:16,325
This cocksucker's
gonna run all over you.

1910
02:33:33,039 --> 02:33:35,959
Come on.
I'll bury these cocksuckers.

1911
02:33:44,920 --> 02:33:47,587
We gotta get organized here.

1912
02:33:58,801 --> 02:34:02,010
Fuck! Manny.

1913
02:34:08,846 --> 02:34:10,848
How the fuck I do that?

1914
02:34:14,974 --> 02:34:17,350
How the fuck I do that, Manny?

1915
02:35:02,951 --> 02:35:03,994
Manolo.

1916
02:35:57,724 --> 02:35:59,809
Is this what you want, Tony?

1917
02:36:11,022 --> 02:36:13,938
You can't stand for another man
to be touching me.

1918
02:36:16,357 --> 02:36:18,232
So you want me, Tony?

1919
02:36:21,983 --> 02:36:23,526
What are you talking about?

1920
02:36:25,111 --> 02:36:26,611
Is that it?

1921
02:36:30,446 --> 02:36:31,863
Here I am, Tony.

1922
02:36:36,823 --> 02:36:39,033
I am all yours now, Tony, you see?

1923
02:36:41,825 --> 02:36:43,409
I'm all yours now.

1924
02:36:46,118 --> 02:36:48,369
You better come and get me now.

1925
02:36:49,288 --> 02:36:51,205
Come on.
Come and get me.

1926
02:36:51,289 --> 02:36:52,789
Come and get me.

1927
02:36:53,790 --> 02:36:56,540
You do it now before it's too late.

1928
02:36:59,250 --> 02:37:00,417
Come on, Tony.

1929
02:37:02,583 --> 02:37:03,793
Fuck me.

1930
02:37:07,836 --> 02:37:10,254
Fuck me. Come on and just fuck me!

1931
02:37:27,178 --> 02:37:28,179
Die!

1932
02:37:42,308 --> 02:37:44,977
They're all over the place!
Get out of here!

1933
02:38:08,445 --> 02:38:12,613
Come on. Look at your face.
It's all dirty.

1934
02:38:30,120 --> 02:38:31,746
Please talk to me.

1935
02:38:33,580 --> 02:38:35,121
Don't be mad at me.

1936
02:38:35,330 --> 02:38:38,707
Please. Gina, come on.

1937
02:38:40,457 --> 02:38:44,167
I love Manny, you know?

1938
02:38:44,542 --> 02:38:45,751
I love him.

1939
02:38:47,794 --> 02:38:50,294
And I love you, too, you know?

1940
02:39:17,014 --> 02:39:18,306
Give me a smile.

1941
02:39:18,389 --> 02:39:22,684
They're coming from everywhere!
Open up! Open the fucking door!

1942
02:39:24,309 --> 02:39:26,310
<i>Please! Tony!</i>

1943
02:39:26,393 --> 02:39:28,393
<i>Let me in, boss! Please!</i>

1944
02:39:28,602 --> 02:39:30,645
<i>Tony, open the fucking door!</i>

1945
02:39:52,528 --> 02:39:57,655
You wait here, okay?
I'll be with you. I'll be back.

1946
02:40:01,198 --> 02:40:03,532
You wait for me. I'm coming back.

1947
02:40:07,410 --> 02:40:09,786
Okay, Sosa.
You want to fuck with me?

1948
02:40:14,455 --> 02:40:16,455
<i>You're fucking with the best!</i>

1949
02:40:20,831 --> 02:40:22,540
You want to fuck with me?

1950
02:40:24,376 --> 02:40:26,126
You cockroaches.

1951
02:40:29,503 --> 02:40:32,212
You want to play games?
Okay, I play with you.

1952
02:40:37,046 --> 02:40:38,672
<i>You wanna play rough?</i>

1953
02:40:40,131 --> 02:40:42,258
Say hello to my little friend!

1954
02:40:45,634 --> 02:40:47,217
<i>You want to play rough?</i>

1955
02:40:48,385 --> 02:40:51,219
<i>There! You like that?</i>

1956
02:40:53,096 --> 02:40:54,388
You want more?

1957
02:41:01,474 --> 02:41:02,725
<i>You whores!</i>

1958
02:41:04,142 --> 02:41:05,225
Cowards!

1959
02:41:52,870 --> 02:41:54,370
Want to fuck with me?

1960
02:42:11,253 --> 02:42:12,961
<i>Go ahead!</i>

1961
02:42:14,420 --> 02:42:15,461
<i>Come on!</i>

1962
02:42:18,212 --> 02:42:20,339
How do you like that?

1963
02:42:21,174 --> 02:42:23,090
<i>You fucking maricón!</i>

1964
02:42:25,549 --> 02:42:27,258
You think you can take me?

1965
02:42:27,342 --> 02:42:29,551
<i>You need a fucking army
if you gonna take me!</i>

1966
02:42:29,676 --> 02:42:33,969
You hear? Come on!
I take you all to fucking hell!

1967
02:42:39,847 --> 02:42:43,057
Who you think you fucking with?
I'm Tony Montana!

1968
02:42:43,973 --> 02:42:46,559
You fuck with me,
you fucking with the best!

1969
02:42:50,768 --> 02:42:52,351
I'm still standing.

1970
02:42:56,688 --> 02:42:59,147
Come on! I take your fucking bullet!

1971
02:43:00,773 --> 02:43:02,648
Come on! I take your fucking bullet!

1972
02:43:02,731 --> 02:43:04,441
You think you kill me with bullets?

1973
02:43:04,566 --> 02:43:07,233
I take your fucking bullets!
Go ahead!

1974
02:43:07,233 --> 02:43:08,275
