00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:55.717
(BUS APPROACHING)

2
00:03:17.948 --> 00:03:19.199
Hello.

3
00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:22.828
My name's Forrest. Forrest Gump.

4
00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:30.419
Do you want a chocolate?

5
00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:36.425
I could eat about
a million and a half of these.

6
00:03:37.592 --> 00:03:42.806
My mama always said
life was like a box of chocolates.

7
00:03:44.808 --> 00:03:47.686
You never know what you're gonna get.

8
00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:57.446
Those must be comfortable shoes.

9
00:03:58.822 --> 00:04:03.493
I'll bet you could walk all day
in shoes like that and not feel a thing.

10
00:04:05.704 --> 00:04:08.165
I wish I had shoes like that.

11
00:04:08.832 --> 00:04:10.375
My feet hurt.

12
00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:13.253
Mama always said there's an awful lot

13
00:04:13.336 --> 00:04:16.548
you could tell about a person
by their shoes:

14
00:04:17.674 --> 00:04:20.635
where they're going,
where they've been.

15
00:04:27.893 --> 00:04:29.936
I've worn lots of shoes.

16
00:04:33.064 --> 00:04:37.861
I bet if I think about it real hard,
I could remember my first pair of shoes.

17
00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:43.408
Mama said they'd take me anywhere.

18
00:04:44.201 --> 00:04:46.828
<i>She said they was my magic shoes.</i>

19
00:04:46.912 --> 00:04:50.081
All right, Forrest,
you can open your eyes now.

20
00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.841
Let's take a little walk around.

21
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.433
How do those feel?

22
00:05:11.394 --> 00:05:13.563
His legs are strong, Mrs. Gump,

23
00:05:13.647 --> 00:05:16.149
as strong as I've ever seen,

24
00:05:16.233 --> 00:05:19.611
but his back is as crooked
as a politician.

25
00:05:20.904 --> 00:05:23.990
But we're gonna straighten him right up,
now, aren't we, Forrest?

26
00:05:24.074 --> 00:05:25.200
Forrest!

27
00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:27.911
<i>FORREST: Now, when I was a baby,</i>

28
00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:30.831
<i>Mama named me after
the great Civil War hero,</i>

29
00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:33.333
<i>General Nathan Bedford Forrest.</i>

30
00:05:33.416 --> 00:05:35.627
<i>She said we was related to him
in some way.</i>

31
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.087
<i>And what he did was,</i>

32
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:41.424
<i>he started up this club called
the Ku Klux Klan.</i>

33
00:05:41.508 --> 00:05:44.845
<i>They'd all dress up in their robes
and their bed sheets</i>

34
00:05:44.928 --> 00:05:49.266
<i>and act like a bunch of ghosts
or spooks or something.</i>

35
00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:53.228
<i>They'd even put bed sheets
on their horses and ride around.</i>

36
00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:56.356
<i>And anyway, that's how I got my name,</i>

37
00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:57.858
<i>Forrest Gump.</i>

38
00:05:57.941 --> 00:05:59.693
<i>Mama said that the "Forrest" part</i>

39
00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:03.321
<i>was to remind me that sometimes
we all do things that,</i>

40
00:06:03.405 --> 00:06:06.199
<i>well, just don't make no sense.</i>

41
00:06:06.658 --> 00:06:07.659
(CLANG)

42
00:06:11.872 --> 00:06:15.375
Okay... Get it, get it...

43
00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:18.420
Wait, is it this way? Hold on.

44
00:06:19.337 --> 00:06:20.839
All right...

45
00:06:21.423 --> 00:06:23.091
What are you all staring at?

46
00:06:23.174 --> 00:06:27.637
Haven't you ever seen a little boy
with braces on his legs before?

47
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.893
Don't ever let anybody tell you
they're better than you, Forrest.

48
00:06:32.976 --> 00:06:35.562
If God intended
everybody to be the same,

49
00:06:35.645 --> 00:06:37.772
he'd have given us all braces
on our legs.

50
00:06:37.856 --> 00:06:39.566
<i>FORREST: Mama always had a way of
explaining things</i>

51
00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:41.651
<i>so I could understand them.</i>

52
00:06:43.111 --> 00:06:46.615
<i>We lived about a quarter mile
off Route 17,</i>

53
00:06:46.698 --> 00:06:49.743
<i>about a half mile from
the town of Greenbow, Alabama.</i>

54
00:06:49.826 --> 00:06:52.579
<i>That's in the county of Greenbow.</i>

55
00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:57.083
<i>Our house had been in Mama's family
since her grandpa's grandpa's grandpa</i>

56
00:06:57.167 --> 00:06:59.085
<i>had come across the ocean
about 1,000 years ago,</i>

57
00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:01.087
<i>something like that.</i>

58
00:07:01.171 --> 00:07:03.882
<i>Since it was just me and Mama
and we had all these empty rooms,</i>

59
00:07:03.965 --> 00:07:06.718
<i>Mama decided to let those rooms out,</i>

60
00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:08.762
<i>mostly to people passing through,</i>

61
00:07:08.845 --> 00:07:12.807
<i>like from, oh, Mobile,
Montgomery, places like that.</i>

62
00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:15.602
<i>That's how me and Mama got money.</i>

63
00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:18.438
<i>Mama was a real smart lady.</i>

64
00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:23.526
Remember what I told you, Forrest.
You're no different than anybody else is.

65
00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:28.406
Did you hear what I said, Forrest?

66
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:32.661
You're the same as everybody else.
You are no different.

67
00:07:33.161 --> 00:07:37.624
Your boy's different, Mrs. Gump.

68
00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:39.918
Now, his IQ is 75.

69
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:43.838
Well, we're all different, Mr. Hancock.

70
00:07:47.425 --> 00:07:49.469
<i>FORREST: She wanted me to have
the finest education,</i>

71
00:07:49.552 --> 00:07:53.473
<i>so she took me to
the Greenbow County Central School.</i>

72
00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:55.809
<i>I met the principal and all.</i>

73
00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:59.187
I want to show you something,
Mrs. Gump.

74
00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:02.524
Now, this is normal.

75
00:08:03.024 --> 00:08:06.319
Forrest is right here.

76
00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:12.701
The state requires a minimum IQ of
80 to attend public school, Mrs. Gump.

77
00:08:13.201 --> 00:08:16.079
He's gonna have to go
to a special school.

78
00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:18.289
Now, he'll be just fine.

79
00:08:19.082 --> 00:08:21.167
What does "normal" mean, anyway?

80
00:08:21.251 --> 00:08:24.629
He might be a bit on the slow side,

81
00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:27.507
but my boy Forrest is gonna get

82
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.135
the same opportunities
as everyone else.

83
00:08:30.218 --> 00:08:34.014
He's not going to some special school
to learn how to re-tread tires.

84
00:08:34.097 --> 00:08:37.267
We're talking about
five little points here.

85
00:08:38.977 --> 00:08:41.604
There must be something can be done.

86
00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:45.650
We're a progressive school system.

87
00:08:46.484 --> 00:08:49.404
We don't want to see anybody
left behind.

88
00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.742
Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?

89
00:08:56.995 --> 00:08:58.872
He's on vacation.

90
00:08:59.873 --> 00:09:02.625
(GASPING AND PANTING)

91
00:09:16.347 --> 00:09:20.143
Well, your mama sure does care
about your schooling, son.

92
00:09:25.648 --> 00:09:28.109
You don't say much, do you?

93
00:09:31.488 --> 00:09:34.657
(GASPING AND PANTING)

94
00:09:39.621 --> 00:09:41.581
"Finally, he had to try.

95
00:09:41.664 --> 00:09:43.625
"It looked easy, but,

96
00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:47.170
"oh, what happened.

97
00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:50.256
- "First, there..."
- Mama, what's "vacation" mean?

98
00:09:50.799 --> 00:09:53.384
- Vacation?
- Where Daddy went.

99
00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:58.723
Vacation's when you go somewhere

100
00:10:01.101 --> 00:10:03.436
and you don't ever come back.

101
00:10:07.774 --> 00:10:11.569
<i>FORREST: Anyway, I guess you could
say me and Mama was on our own.</i>

102
00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:16.407
<i>But we didn't mind.
Our house was never empty.</i>

103
00:10:16.491 --> 00:10:19.077
<i>There was always folks
coming and going.</i>

104
00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.245
MRS. GUMP: Supper.

105
00:10:20.328 --> 00:10:23.748
- It's supper, everyone. Forrest...
- My, my. That sure looks special.

106
00:10:23.832 --> 00:10:26.376
<i>FORREST: Sometimes we had
so many people staying with us</i>

107
00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:29.129
<i>that every room
was filled with travelers.</i>

108
00:10:29.212 --> 00:10:32.841
<i>You know, folks living out
of their suitcases</i>

109
00:10:32.924 --> 00:10:35.885
<i>and hat cases and sample cases.</i>

110
00:10:35.969 --> 00:10:39.389
Forrest Gump, it's suppertime! Forrest...

111
00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:42.016
<i>One time, a young man
was staying with us,</i>

112
00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:45.728
<i>and he had him a guitar case.</i>

113
00:10:53.862 --> 00:10:56.698
(SINGING <i>HOUND DOG)</i>

114
00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:03.705
Forrest! I told you not to bother
this nice young man.

115
00:11:03.788 --> 00:11:05.123
ELVIS PRESLEY:
Oh, no, that's all right, ma'am.

116
00:11:05.206 --> 00:11:08.042
I was just showing him a thing or two
on the guitar here.

117
00:11:08.126 --> 00:11:11.087
All right, but your supper's ready
if y'all want to eat.

118
00:11:11.171 --> 00:11:14.132
Yeah, that sounds good.
Thank you, ma'am.

119
00:11:14.799 --> 00:11:18.386
Say, man, show me that crazy
little walk you just did there.

120
00:11:18.469 --> 00:11:20.346
Slow it down some.

121
00:11:20.555 --> 00:11:22.390
(SINGING <i>HOUND DOG)</i>

122
00:11:22.473 --> 00:11:24.392
<i>FORREST: I liked that guitar.</i>

123
00:11:25.059 --> 00:11:26.811
<i>It sounded good.</i>

124
00:11:28.605 --> 00:11:32.775
<i>I started moving around to the music,</i>

125
00:11:32.859 --> 00:11:34.694
<i>swinging my hips.</i>

126
00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.824
<i>This one night,
me and Mama was out shopping,</i>

127
00:11:39.908 --> 00:11:42.911
<i>and we walked right by
Benson's furniture and appliance store,</i>

128
00:11:42.994 --> 00:11:44.579
<i>and guess what?</i>

129
00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:49.334
<i>(SINGING</i> HOUND DOG)

130
00:11:56.925 --> 00:11:59.761
This is not for children's eyes.

131
00:12:02.305 --> 00:12:04.098
<i>Some years later,
that handsome young man</i>

132
00:12:04.182 --> 00:12:06.726
<i>who they called "The King,"</i>

133
00:12:06.809 --> 00:12:09.145
<i>well, he'd sung too many songs,</i>

134
00:12:09.812 --> 00:12:12.357
<i>had himself a heart attack,
or something.</i>

135
00:12:13.441 --> 00:12:15.610
Must be hard being a king.

136
00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:22.742
You know, it's funny how you remember
some things, but some things you can't.

137
00:12:23.493 --> 00:12:27.372
- You do your very best now, Forrest.
- I sure will, Mama.

138
00:12:29.082 --> 00:12:33.670
<i>FORREST: I remember the bus ride
on the first day of school very well.</i>

139
00:12:37.215 --> 00:12:38.925
Are you coming along?

140
00:12:39.008 --> 00:12:42.512
Mama said not to be taking
rides from strangers.

141
00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:44.764
This is the bus to school.

142
00:12:47.725 --> 00:12:49.978
I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.

143
00:12:50.937 --> 00:12:54.941
- I'm Dorothy Harris.
- Well, now we ain't strangers anymore.

144
00:13:07.954 --> 00:13:09.747
This seat's taken.

145
00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:13.710
It's taken!

146
00:13:21.592 --> 00:13:23.469
You can't sit here.

147
00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:29.058
<i>FORREST: You know, it's funny what
a young man recollects,</i>

148
00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:31.519
<i>'cause I don't remember being born.</i>

149
00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:35.315
I don't recall what I got
for my first Christmas,

150
00:13:35.398 --> 00:13:38.484
and I don't know when I went
on my first outdoor picnic.

151
00:13:38.568 --> 00:13:43.281
But I do remember the first time I heard

152
00:13:43.364 --> 00:13:46.200
the sweetest voice in the wide world.

153
00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:49.078
JENNY: You can sit here if you want.

154
00:13:51.998 --> 00:13:55.877
<i>I had never seen anything
so beautiful in my life.</i>

155
00:13:56.586 --> 00:13:58.671
<i>She was like an angel.</i>

156
00:13:58.755 --> 00:14:01.674
Well, are you gonna sit down,
or aren't you?

157
00:14:06.637 --> 00:14:08.431
What's wrong with your legs?

158
00:14:08.514 --> 00:14:12.769
Nothing at all, thank you.
My legs are just fine and dandy.

159
00:14:13.686 --> 00:14:15.855
<i>I just sat next to her on that bus</i>

160
00:14:15.938 --> 00:14:18.024
<i>and had a conversation
all the way to school.</i>

161
00:14:18.107 --> 00:14:20.818
...my back's crooked like
a question mark.

162
00:14:20.902 --> 00:14:22.070
These are going to make me...

163
00:14:22.153 --> 00:14:26.908
<i>And next to Mama, no one ever
talked to me or asked me questions.</i>

164
00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:29.410
Are you stupid or something?

165
00:14:29.494 --> 00:14:32.497
Mama says, "Stupid is as stupid does."

166
00:14:34.123 --> 00:14:37.794
- I'm Jenny.
- I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.

167
00:14:38.461 --> 00:14:40.296
<i>From that day on,
we was always together.</i>

168
00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:43.216
<i>Jenny and me was like
peas and carrots.</i>

169
00:14:46.803 --> 00:14:48.429
<i>She taught me how to climb.</i>

00:38:14.209 --> 00:38:17.378
Just... You can't keep
doing this all the time.

504
00:38:17.879 --> 00:38:20.799
I can't help it. I love you.

505
00:38:21.758 --> 00:38:25.261
Forrest, you don't know what love is.

506
00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:35.563
You remember that time
we prayed, Forrest?

507
00:38:36.439 --> 00:38:40.944
We prayed for God to turn me
into a bird so I could fly far, far away?

508
00:38:42.904 --> 00:38:44.280
Yes, I do.

509
00:38:48.243 --> 00:38:51.079
You think I could fly off this bridge?

510
00:38:57.752 --> 00:38:59.921
What do you mean, Jenny?

511
00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:05.301
Nothing.

512
00:39:08.263 --> 00:39:10.306
I gotta get out of here.

513
00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:13.685
Wait, Jenny...

514
00:39:13.768 --> 00:39:18.231
Forrest, you stay away from me, okay?
You just stay away from me, please.

515
00:39:18.314 --> 00:39:19.607
Can I have a ride?

516
00:39:19.691 --> 00:39:21.234
- MAN: Where you going?
- I don't care.

517
00:39:21.317 --> 00:39:22.694
Get in the truck.

518
00:39:22.777 --> 00:39:24.612
So, bye-bye, Jenny.

519
00:39:27.115 --> 00:39:29.450
They sending me to Vietnam.

520
00:39:32.203 --> 00:39:34.622
It's this whole other country.

521
00:39:37.125 --> 00:39:39.127
Just hang on a minute.

522
00:39:40.545 --> 00:39:43.590
Listen, you promise me
something, okay?

523
00:39:43.673 --> 00:39:47.010
Just, if you're ever in trouble,
don't try to be brave. You just run, okay?

524
00:39:47.135 --> 00:39:48.720
Just run away.

525
00:39:49.971 --> 00:39:51.306
Okay.

526
00:39:56.185 --> 00:39:57.520
Jenny.

527
00:39:59.397 --> 00:40:01.691
I'll write you all the time.

528
00:40:10.825 --> 00:40:13.828
<i>FORREST: And just like that,
she was gone.</i>

529
00:40:29.928 --> 00:40:33.264
You come back safe to me,
do you hear?

530
00:41:16.557 --> 00:41:20.520
<i>Now, they told us that Vietnam
was gonna be very different</i>

531
00:41:20.603 --> 00:41:23.481
<i>from the United States of America.</i>

532
00:41:23.564 --> 00:41:28.611
<i>And except for all the beer cans
and the barbecue, it was.</i>

533
00:41:38.746 --> 00:41:41.833
Hey, I bet there's shrimp
all in these waters.

534
00:41:41.916 --> 00:41:45.086
They tell me these Vietnams
is good shrimpers.

535
00:41:45.169 --> 00:41:48.715
You know, after we win this war,
and we take over everything,

536
00:41:48.798 --> 00:41:50.008
we can get American shrimpers

537
00:41:50.091 --> 00:41:51.843
to come out here
and shrimp these waters.

538
00:41:51.926 --> 00:41:53.469
We'll just shrimp all the time, man.

539
00:41:53.594 --> 00:41:56.764
So much shrimp, why,
you wouldn't believe it.

540
00:41:57.432 --> 00:41:59.350
You must be my FNGs.

541
00:41:59.434 --> 00:42:00.685
- Morning, sir!
- Morning, sir!

542
00:42:00.768 --> 00:42:03.396
Get your hands down! Do not salute me.

543
00:42:03.479 --> 00:42:05.606
There's goddamn snipers
all around this area

544
00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:08.526
who would love to grease an officer.

545
00:42:08.609 --> 00:42:12.113
I'm Lieutenant Dan Taylor.
Welcome to Fourth Platoon.

546
00:42:12.989 --> 00:42:15.408
What's wrong with your lip?

547
00:42:15.491 --> 00:42:17.869
I was born with big gums, sir.

548
00:42:17.952 --> 00:42:22.665
Yeah, well, you better tuck that in.
Gonna get that caught on a trip wire.

549
00:42:23.833 --> 00:42:25.209
Where you boys from in the world?

550
00:42:25.293 --> 00:42:27.670
- Alabama, sir!
- Alabama, sir!

551
00:42:28.379 --> 00:42:29.881
You twins?

552
00:42:31.966 --> 00:42:34.385
No, we are not relations, sir.

553
00:42:36.637 --> 00:42:39.557
Look, it's pretty basic here.

554
00:42:40.349 --> 00:42:42.810
If you stick with me
and learn from the guys

555
00:42:42.894 --> 00:42:45.563
who've been in country a while,
you'll be all right.

556
00:42:45.646 --> 00:42:47.565
There is one item of GI gear

557
00:42:47.648 --> 00:42:51.819
that can be the difference between
a live grunt and a dead grunt.

558
00:42:52.153 --> 00:42:55.323
Socks. Cushion sole, OD green.

559
00:42:55.406 --> 00:42:56.699
Try and keep your feet dry.

560
00:42:56.824 --> 00:42:58.242
When we're out humping,
I want you boys to remember

561
00:42:58.326 --> 00:43:00.787
to change your socks whenever we stop.

562
00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:03.831
The Mekong will eat a grunt's feet
right off his legs.

563
00:43:03.915 --> 00:43:06.209
Sergeant Sims, God damn it,

564
00:43:06.334 --> 00:43:07.752
where is that sling rope
I told you to order?

565
00:43:07.835 --> 00:43:09.754
I put in the requisitions at Battalion.

566
00:43:09.837 --> 00:43:11.839
DAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah, well,
you call those sons of bitches again...

567
00:43:11.923 --> 00:43:14.467
<i>FORREST: Lieutenant Dan
sure knew his stuff.</i>

568
00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:16.844
<i>I felt real lucky he was my lieutenant.</i>

569
00:43:17.595 --> 00:43:21.057
<i>He was from a long,
great military tradition.</i>

570
00:43:21.265 --> 00:43:24.352
<i>Somebody in his family
had fought and died</i>

571
00:43:25.353 --> 00:43:29.607
<i>in every single American war.</i>

572
00:43:30.525 --> 00:43:32.527
- God damn it, kick some ass!
- I'm on it, Lieutenant.

573
00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:33.736
Get on it!

574
00:43:33.861 --> 00:43:37.198
<i>I guess you could say he had
a lot to live up to.</i>

575
00:43:38.908 --> 00:43:43.746
So, you boys are from Arkansas, huh?
Well, I've been through there.

576
00:43:43.871 --> 00:43:46.040
Little Rock's a fine town.

577
00:43:46.707 --> 00:43:50.294
Now, go shake down your gear,
see the platoon sergeant,

578
00:43:50.378 --> 00:43:52.839
draw what you need for the field.

579
00:43:52.922 --> 00:43:56.884
If you boys are hungry,
we got steaks burning right over here.

580
00:43:56.968 --> 00:43:59.846
Two standing orders in this platoon:

581
00:43:59.929 --> 00:44:02.598
one, take good care of your feet,

582
00:44:02.723 --> 00:44:07.770
two, try not to do anything stupid,
like getting yourself killed.

583
00:44:14.235 --> 00:44:16.320
I sure hope I don't let him down.

584
00:44:27.915 --> 00:44:30.418
<i>FORREST: I got to see
a lot of the countryside.</i>

585
00:44:30.501 --> 00:44:32.837
<i>We would take these real long walks.</i>

586
00:44:41.304 --> 00:44:45.433
<i>And we were always looking
for this guy named Charlie.</i>

587
00:44:53.274 --> 00:44:55.526
DAN: Hold it up!
SOLDIER: Hold up, boys!

588
00:44:58.362 --> 00:45:00.698
<i>It wasn't always fun.</i>

589
00:45:00.781 --> 00:45:05.077
<i>Lieutenant Dan was always getting
these funny feelings about a rock,</i>

590
00:45:05.161 --> 00:45:10.249
<i>or a trail, or the road,
so he'd tell us to get down, shut up...</i>

591
00:45:10.333 --> 00:45:12.335
Get down! Shut up!

592
00:45:13.294 --> 00:45:14.754
<i>(WHISPERING) ...so we did.</i>

593
00:45:32.313 --> 00:45:34.482
<i>Now, I don't know much about anything,</i>

594
00:45:34.565 --> 00:45:38.402
<i>but I think some of America's
best young men served in this war.</i>

595
00:45:38.486 --> 00:45:41.197
<i>There was Dallas, from Phoenix,</i>

596
00:45:42.907 --> 00:45:45.701
<i>Cleveland, he was from Detroit.</i>

597
00:45:45.826 --> 00:45:48.204
(WHISPERING) Hey, Tex. Hey, Tex.

598
00:45:48.329 --> 00:45:50.498
Man, what the hell's going on?

599
00:45:50.581 --> 00:45:54.919
<i>And Tex was... Well, I don't remember
where Tex come from.</i>

600
00:45:55.002 --> 00:45:56.545
DAN: Nothing.

601
00:46:00.675 --> 00:46:03.177
Fourth Platoon, on your feet.

602
00:46:03.261 --> 00:46:06.973
Still got 10 klicks to go to that river.
Move out.

603
00:46:07.056 --> 00:46:08.849
Come on, move out.

604
00:46:10.893 --> 00:46:13.312
Step it up. Look alive out there.

605
00:46:13.396 --> 00:46:17.733
<i>The good thing about Vietnam
is there was always some place to go.</i>

606
00:46:17.858 --> 00:46:19.235
DAN: Fire in the hole!

607
00:46:22.697 --> 00:46:25.032
Gump, check out that hole.

608
00:46:25.116 --> 00:46:28.119
<i>And there was always something to do.</i>

609
00:46:28.202 --> 00:46:31.372
- Mount them up.
- SOLDIER: Spread out! Cover his back.

610
00:46:36.419 --> 00:46:42.049
<i>One day, it started raining,
and it didn't quit for four months.</i>

611
00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:45.928
<i>We'd been through
every kind of rain there is:</i>

612
00:46:46.053 --> 00:46:48.597
<i>little bitty stinging rain,</i>

613
00:46:49.307 --> 00:46:51.976
<i>and big old fat rain,</i>

614
00:46:52.435 --> 00:46:55.146
<i>rain that flew in sideways.</i>

615
00:46:55.229 --> 00:46:59.275
<i>And sometimes, rain even seemed
to come straight up from underneath.</i>

616
00:47:01.068 --> 00:47:03.446
<i>Shoot, it even rained at night.</i>

617
00:47:04.488 --> 00:47:06.949
- Hey, Forrest.
- Hey, Bubba.

618
00:47:07.074 --> 00:47:10.369
I'm gonna lean up against you.
You just lean right back against me.

619
00:47:10.453 --> 00:47:14.290
This way, we don't have to sleep
with our heads in the mud.

620
00:47:15.249 --> 00:47:18.711
You know why we a good partnership,
Forrest?

621
00:47:18.794 --> 00:47:21.297
'Cause we be watching out
for one another,

622
00:47:21.422 --> 00:47:23.299
like brothers and stuff.

623
00:47:25.259 --> 00:47:28.929
Hey, Forrest, there's something
I've been thinking about.

624
00:47:29.013 --> 00:47:32.016
I got a very important question
to ask you.

625
00:47:33.642 --> 00:47:37.605
How would you like to go
into the shrimping business with me?

626
00:47:38.773 --> 00:47:40.399
Okay.

627
00:47:40.483 --> 00:47:43.944
Man, I tell you what,
I got it all figured out, too.

628
00:47:44.028 --> 00:47:46.822
So many pounds of shrimp
to pay off the boat,

629
00:47:46.947 --> 00:47:50.242
so many pounds for gas,
we can just live right on the boat.

630
00:47:50.326 --> 00:47:52.620
We ain't got to pay no rent.

631
00:47:52.703 --> 00:47:54.789
I'll be the captain,
we can just work it together,

632
00:47:54.872 --> 00:47:59.126
split everything right down the middle.
Man, I'm telling you, 50-50.

633
00:47:59.210 --> 00:48:02.797
And, hey, Forrest,
all the shrimp you can eat.

634
00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:06.133
That's a fine idea.

635
00:48:07.218 --> 00:48:09.345
<i>FORREST: Bubba did have a fine idea.</i>

636
00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:16.227
<i>I even wrote Jenny
and told her all about it.</i>

637
00:48:17.019 --> 00:48:20.231
<i>I sent her letters,
not every day, but almost.</i>

638
00:48:20.314 --> 00:48:25.319
<i>I told her what I was doing
and asked her what she was doing,</i>

639
00:48:25.403 --> 00:48:28.155
<i>and told her
how I thought about her always,</i>

640
00:48:29.490 --> 00:48:32.451
<i>and how I was looking forward
to getting a letter from her</i>

641
00:48:32.535 --> 00:48:35.037
<i>just as soon as she had the time.</i>

642
00:48:36.914 --> 00:48:39.417
<i>I'd always let her know that I was okay.</i>

643
00:48:40.709 --> 00:48:45.881
<i>Then, I'd sign each letter,
"Love, Forrest Gump."</i>

644
00:49:00.729 --> 00:49:04.483
<i>This one day, we was out walking,
like always,</i>

645
00:49:04.567 --> 00:49:07.528
<i>and then, just like that,</i>

646
00:49:08.446 --> 00:49:11.866
<i>somebody turned off the rain
and the sun come out.</i>

647
00:49:14.869 --> 00:49:16.704
DAN: Ambush!

648
00:49:17.204 --> 00:49:18.581
Take cover!

649
00:49:18.747 --> 00:49:20.124
(GUNS FIRING)

650
00:49:22.209 --> 00:49:23.377
Get down!

651
00:49:23.461 --> 00:49:24.920
Get the sixty!

652
00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:30.176
Get that pig up here, God damn it!

653
00:49:30.259 --> 00:49:32.386
Forrest, you okay?

654
00:49:35.598 --> 00:49:38.225
Strongarm! Strongarm!
Be advised, Strongarm!

655
00:49:38.767 --> 00:49:41.187
Medic, we got a man down!

656
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:44.231
Strongarm, this is Leg Lima 6, over!

657
00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:48.277
Roger, Strongarm, be advised
we have incoming from the tree line

658
00:49:48.402 --> 00:49:51.906
at points blue plus two.
AKs and rockets...

659
00:49:52.573 --> 00:49:54.366
Misfire! Misfire!

660
00:49:56.744 --> 00:49:58.746
DAN: God damn it! Mac!

661
00:49:59.705 --> 00:50:03.125
Get that thing...
Fuck it, get it in the tree line!

662
00:50:04.084 --> 00:50:05.252
Jesus!

663
00:50:05.377 --> 00:50:07.588
My unit is down hard and hurting!

664
00:50:07.713 --> 00:50:11.258
Six are pulling back to Blue Line,
Leg Lima 6 out.

665
00:50:12.051 --> 00:50:14.011
Pull back! Pull back!

666
00:50:14.094 --> 00:50:16.222
Run! Run, Forrest!

667
00:50:16.305 --> 00:50:18.641
- Pull back!
- BUBBA: Forrest, Forrest!

668
00:50:18.766 --> 00:50:21.352
Run, man! Run!

669
00:50:21.435 --> 00:50:23.229
DAN: Pull back! Run!

670
00:50:25.064 --> 00:50:27.274
Run, God damn it, run!

671
00:50:48.462 --> 00:50:53.092
SOLDIER: Medic! Can I get a medic?

672
00:50:53.467 --> 00:50:56.804
<i>FORREST: I ran and ran,
just like Jenny told me to.</i>

673
00:51:00.182 --> 00:51:04.395
<i>I ran so far and so fast
that pretty soon I was all by myself,</i>

674
00:51:04.478 --> 00:51:06.438
<i>which was a bad thing.</i>

675
00:51:06.981 --> 00:51:08.524
Bubba!

676
00:51:10.651 --> 00:51:14.446
<i>Bubba was my best good friend.
I had to make sure that he was okay.</i>

677
00:51:18.158 --> 00:51:20.202
SOLDIER 1: Any friendlies out there?

678
00:51:21.161 --> 00:51:23.330
SOLDIER 2: Yeah, I've got
three over here.

679
00:51:23.956 --> 00:51:25.958
Where the hell are you?

680
00:51:26.542 --> 00:51:27.876
Bubba?

681
00:51:28.961 --> 00:51:31.672
<i>And on my way back to find Bubba,</i>

682
00:51:31.797 --> 00:51:34.592
<i>well, there was this boy
laying on the ground.</i>

683
00:51:34.675 --> 00:51:35.884
Tex!

684
00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:38.971
Okay.

685
00:51:39.054 --> 00:51:43.017
<i>I couldn't just let him lay there all alone,
scared the way he was,</i>

686
00:51:43.142 --> 00:51:47.021
<i>so I grabbed him up
and run him out of there.</i>

687
00:52:02.161 --> 00:52:04.580
<i>And every time I went back
looking for Bubba,</i>

688
00:52:04.705 --> 00:52:08.208
<i>somebody else was saying,
"Help me, Forrest. Help me."</i>

689
00:52:15.883 --> 00:52:17.760
Can't hear... Can't hear...

690
00:52:20.054 --> 00:52:21.347
SOLDIER: No sweat, man. Just lay back.

691
00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:23.932
You'll be okay. You'll be okay.

692
00:52:25.934 --> 00:52:28.979
<i>I started to get scared
that I might never find Bubba.</i>

693
00:52:29.063 --> 00:52:30.314
<i>MAN ON RADIO: ...over.</i>

694
00:52:30.397 --> 00:52:33.692
DAN: Roger, Strongarm,
I know my position is danger close.

695
00:52:33.776 --> 00:52:35.611
We got Charlie all over this area.

696
00:52:35.736 --> 00:52:38.030
I gotta have those fast movers
in here now. Over.

697
00:52:38.113 --> 00:52:41.492
<i>- Six, Strongarm, we want...</i>
- Lieutenant Dan, Coleman's dead!

698
00:52:41.575 --> 00:52:42.785
I know he's dead!

699
00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:45.746
My whole goddamn platoon
is wiped out!

700
00:52:45.871 --> 00:52:47.206
<i>- Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6.</i>
- God damn it!

701
00:52:47.289 --> 00:52:50.000
<i>- Copy this transmission. Over.</i>
- What are you doing?

702
00:52:50.084 --> 00:52:53.420
Just leave me here! Get away.
Just leave me here! Get out!

703
00:52:53.545 --> 00:52:55.839
<i>Leg Lima 6, Strongarm.
How copy this? Over.</i>

704
00:52:55.923 --> 00:52:58.550
God, I said leave me here, God damn it!

705
00:52:58.634 --> 00:53:01.804
<i>Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6,
this is Strongarm, be advised</i>

706
00:53:01.929 --> 00:53:03.889
<i>your fast movers
are inbound at this time, over.</i>

707
00:53:03.972 --> 00:53:07.393
<i>FORREST: Then, it felt like something
just jumped up and bit me.</i>

708
00:53:08.268 --> 00:53:09.937
Something bit me!

709
00:53:16.819 --> 00:53:18.946
You chink son of a bitch!

710
00:53:21.448 --> 00:53:23.450
I can't leave the platoon.

711
00:53:23.575 --> 00:53:28.497
I told you to leave me there, Gump.
Forget about me. Get yourself out!

712
00:53:28.622 --> 00:53:30.749
Did you hear what I said?

713
00:53:31.458 --> 00:53:33.419
God damn it, put me down!

714
00:53:34.128 --> 00:53:36.171
Get your ass out of here!

715
00:53:39.466 --> 00:53:42.052
I didn't ask you to pull me out of there,
God damn you!

716
00:53:42.136 --> 00:53:43.470
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

717
00:53:43.595 --> 00:53:44.680
To get Bubba.

718
00:53:44.805 --> 00:53:48.642
I got an air strike inbound right now.
They're gonna nape the whole area.

719
00:53:48.767 --> 00:53:51.145
Gump, you stay here, God damn it!
That's an order!

720
00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:53.689
I gotta find Bubba!

721
00:54:09.663 --> 00:54:11.123
BUBBA: Forrest.

722
00:54:18.881 --> 00:54:21.550
- Bubba.
- I'm okay, Forrest.

723
00:54:22.342 --> 00:54:24.011
I'm okay.

724
00:54:31.852 --> 00:54:33.687
Oh, Bubba, no...

725
00:54:33.812 --> 00:54:36.023
Nah, I'm gonna be all right.

726
00:54:37.941 --> 00:54:39.777
(MEN CHATTERING)

727
00:54:44.198 --> 00:54:46.867
Come on. Come on. Come on.

728
00:54:51.872 --> 00:54:53.373
I'm okay, Forrest.

729
00:54:54.708 --> 00:54:57.544
I'm okay, man. I'm fine.

730
00:55:34.581 --> 00:55:37.709
DAN: Helo's inbound.
Top smoke, get it out there!

731
00:55:38.752 --> 00:55:43.257
<i>If I'd a known this was gonna be the
last time me and Bubba was gonna talk,</i>

732
00:55:43.382 --> 00:55:45.676
<i>I'd of thought of something better to say.</i>

733
00:55:45.759 --> 00:55:47.261
Hey, Bubba.

734
00:55:48.387 --> 00:55:49.763
Hey, Forrest.

735
00:55:52.099 --> 00:55:55.310
Forrest, why'd this happen?

736
00:55:56.645 --> 00:55:58.438
You got shot.

737
00:56:00.148 --> 00:56:04.319
<i>Then Bubba said something
I won't ever forget.</i>

738
00:56:05.112 --> 00:56:06.780
I wanna go home.

739
00:56:08.782 --> 00:56:10.826
<i>Bubba was my best good friend.</i>

740
00:56:11.785 --> 00:56:16.331
<i>And even I know that ain't something
you can find just around the corner.</i>

741
00:56:16.456 --> 00:56:19.543
<i>Bubba was gonna be
a shrimping boat captain,</i>

742
00:56:19.626 --> 00:56:23.589
<i>but instead he died right there
by that river in Vietnam.</i>

743
00:56:29.303 --> 00:56:31.597
That's all I have to say about that.

744
00:56:33.974 --> 00:56:36.143
It was a bullet, wasn't it?

745
00:56:38.478 --> 00:56:41.148
- A bullet?
- That jumped up and bit you.

746
00:56:43.525 --> 00:56:45.611
Oh, yes, sir.

747
00:56:45.694 --> 00:56:48.822
Bit me directly in the buttocks.

748
00:56:48.947 --> 00:56:54.202
They said it was a million-dollar wound,
but the Army must keep that money,

749
00:56:54.328 --> 00:56:58.165
'cause I still ain't seen a nickel
of that million dollars.

750
00:56:58.999 --> 00:57:02.502
The only good thing
about being wounded in the buttocks

751
00:57:02.628 --> 00:57:04.338
<i>is the ice cream.</i>

752
00:57:04.463 --> 00:57:07.049
<i>They gave me all the ice cream
I could eat.</i>

753
00:57:07.174 --> 00:57:08.467
<i>And guess what?</i>

754
00:57:08.550 --> 00:57:11.678
<i>A good friend of mine
was in the bed right next door.</i>

755
00:57:13.889 --> 00:57:16.975
Lieutenant Dan,
I got you some ice cream.

756
00:57:19.353 --> 00:57:21.521
Lieutenant Dan, ice cream.

757
00:57:33.241 --> 00:57:35.535
MALE NURSE:
It's time for your bath, Lieutenant.

758
00:57:44.044 --> 00:57:45.379
Harper!

759
00:57:48.590 --> 00:57:51.051
Cooper, Larson,

760
00:57:53.261 --> 00:57:54.596
Webster,

761
00:57:56.014 --> 00:57:59.518
- Gump. Gump.
- I'm Forrest Gump.

762
00:58:03.063 --> 00:58:06.358
Kyle, Nichols,

763
00:58:08.568 --> 00:58:14.533
McMill, Johnson, Tyler,

764
00:58:15.867 --> 00:58:17.244
Holiday...

765
00:58:24.001 --> 00:58:26.253
<i>MAN ON TV:
Surprise, surprise, surprise!</i>

766
00:58:29.589 --> 00:58:32.092
Gump, how can you watch
that stupid shit?

767
00:58:32.175 --> 00:58:33.760
<i>- From the DMZ to the Delta...</i>
- Turn it off!

768
00:58:33.844 --> 00:58:37.097
<i>...you are tuned to the
American Forces Vietnam Network.</i>

769
00:58:37.222 --> 00:58:39.558
<i>This is Channel 6, Saigon.</i>

770
00:58:42.269 --> 00:58:43.937
SOLDIER: Good catch, Gump.

771
00:58:45.897 --> 00:58:48.066
You know how to play this?

772
00:58:49.359 --> 00:58:51.445
Come on, let me show you. Here.

773
00:58:53.530 --> 00:58:55.866
Now, the secret to this game is,

774
00:58:55.949 --> 00:59:01.788
no matter what happens,
never ever take your eye off the ball.

775
00:59:05.375 --> 00:59:06.710
All right.

776
00:59:10.047 --> 00:59:13.717
<i>For some reason,
Ping-Pong came very natural to me.</i>

777
00:59:14.051 --> 00:59:16.970
See? Any idiot can play.

778
00:59:17.471 --> 00:59:20.223
<i>So, I started playing it all the time.</i>

779
00:59:21.391 --> 00:59:22.726
<i>I played Ping-Pong</i>

780
00:59:22.809 --> 00:59:26.104
<i>even when I didn't have anyone
to play Ping-Pong with.</i>

781
00:59:34.154 --> 00:59:38.825
<i>The hospital's people said
it made me look like a duck in water,</i>

782
00:59:38.950 --> 00:59:40.786
<i>whatever that means.</i>

783
00:59:41.244 --> 00:59:44.498
<i>Even Lieutenant Dan would come
and watch me play.</i>

784
00:59:50.003 --> 00:59:53.882
<i>I played Ping-Pong so much,
I even played it in my sleep.</i>

785
01:00:01.681 --> 01:00:06.770
Now, you listen to me.
We all have a destiny.

786
01:00:06.853 --> 01:00:09.898
Nothing just happens,
it's all part of a plan.

787
01:00:10.023 --> 01:00:12.692
I should have died out there
with my men,

788
01:00:12.818 --> 01:00:16.780
but now I'm nothing
but a goddamn cripple,

789
01:00:16.863 --> 01:00:20.492
a legless freak! Look! Look! Look at me!

790
01:00:21.243 --> 01:00:22.327
Do you see that?

791
01:00:22.410 --> 01:00:26.206
Do you know what it's like
not to be able to use your legs?

792
01:00:29.543 --> 01:00:31.169
Yes, sir, I do.

793
01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:36.883
Did you hear what I said?

794
01:00:37.759 --> 01:00:39.511
You cheated me.

795
01:00:39.594 --> 01:00:40.762
I had a destiny.

796
01:00:40.846 --> 01:00:44.391
I was supposed to die in the field,
with honor!

797
01:00:45.058 --> 01:00:49.104
That was my destiny,
and you cheated me out of it!

798
01:00:58.738 --> 01:01:01.449
Do you understand
what I'm saying, Gump?

799
01:01:03.577 --> 01:01:06.955
This wasn't supposed to happen,
not to me.

800
01:01:09.583 --> 01:01:11.251
I had a destiny.

801
01:01:13.211 --> 01:01:17.591
I was Lieutenant Dan Taylor.

802
01:01:23.763 --> 01:01:26.099
You're still Lieutenant Dan.

803
01:01:49.331 --> 01:01:50.832
Look at me.

804
01:01:52.167 --> 01:01:54.127
What am I gonna do now?

805
01:01:57.797 --> 01:01:59.841
What am I gonna do now?

806
01:02:10.227 --> 01:02:11.686
PFC Gump?

807
01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:14.648
Yes, sir!

808
01:02:15.315 --> 01:02:16.816
As you were.

809
01:02:17.317 --> 01:02:21.154
Son, you've been awarded
the Medal of Honor.

810
01:02:22.197 --> 01:02:25.825
Guess what, Lieutenant Dan,
they want to give me a...

811
01:02:32.582 --> 01:02:36.336
Ma'am, what'd they do
with Lieutenant Dan?

812
01:02:37.254 --> 01:02:39.047
They sent him home.

813
01:02:45.053 --> 01:02:47.806
<i>FORREST:
Two weeks later, I left Vietnam.</i>

814
01:02:48.848 --> 01:02:52.394
<i>The ceremony was kicked off
with a candid speech by the President</i>

815
01:02:52.477 --> 01:02:55.855
<i>regarding the need for further escalation
of the war in Vietnam.</i>

816
01:02:55.939 --> 01:02:58.066
<i>President Johnson awarded
four Medals of Honor</i>

817
01:02:58.149 --> 01:02:59.818
<i>to men
from each of the Armed Services.</i>

818
01:02:59.901 --> 01:03:02.821
<i>America owes you
a debt of gratitude, son.</i>

819
01:03:04.823 --> 01:03:08.618
<i>I understand you were wounded.
Where were you hit?</i>

820
01:03:08.702 --> 01:03:11.871
<i>- In the buttocks, sir.
- That must be a sight.</i>

821
01:03:12.622 --> 01:03:14.916
<i>I'd kind of like to see that.</i>

822
01:03:26.344 --> 01:03:27.637
(CHUCKLING)

823
01:03:29.055 --> 01:03:30.515
<i>God damn, son.</i>

824
01:03:32.642 --> 01:03:36.479
<i>After that,
Mama went to the hotel to lay down,</i>

825
01:03:36.563 --> 01:03:40.066
<i>so I went out for a walk
to see our nation's capital.</i>

826
01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:41.693
ISABEL: Hilary, all right,
I've got the vets,

827
01:03:41.776 --> 01:03:43.278
what do you want me to do with them?

828
01:03:43.361 --> 01:03:45.113
HILARY: What are you doing here
so late?

829
01:03:45.196 --> 01:03:49.242
<i>It's a good thing Mama was resting,
'cause the streets was awful crowded</i>

830
01:03:49.326 --> 01:03:52.495
<i>with people looking
at all the statues and monuments,</i>

831
01:03:52.579 --> 01:03:55.206
<i>and some of them people were loud
and pushy.</i>

832
01:03:55.290 --> 01:03:58.251
Okay, follow me! Come on.
Let's move it out.

833
01:03:59.085 --> 01:04:02.047
<i>Everywhere I went,
I had to stand in line.</i>

834
01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:06.843
HILARY: Follow me, let's go!

835
01:04:08.636 --> 01:04:10.263
Come on. Let's go.

836
01:04:16.311 --> 01:04:17.896
Stand here.

837
01:04:20.357 --> 01:04:23.526
Hey, you're a good man
for doing this. Good!

838
01:04:24.819 --> 01:04:25.945
Okay.

02:02:04.526 --> 02:02:06.653
I named him after his daddy.

1490
02:02:07.612 --> 02:02:10.073
He got a daddy named Forrest, too?

1491
02:02:11.366 --> 02:02:13.409
You're his daddy, Forrest.

1492
02:02:27.882 --> 02:02:29.092
Hey.

1493
02:02:30.260 --> 02:02:33.137
Forrest, look at me. Look at me, Forrest.

1494
02:02:35.723 --> 02:02:39.853
There's nothing you need to do, okay?
You didn't do anything wrong.

1495
02:02:40.395 --> 02:02:41.771
Okay?

1496
02:02:46.109 --> 02:02:47.986
Isn't he beautiful?

1497
02:02:48.987 --> 02:02:51.948
He's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1498
02:02:55.743 --> 02:02:56.828
But...

1499
02:03:00.498 --> 02:03:03.376
Is he smart, or...

1500
02:03:03.459 --> 02:03:07.463
He's very smart.
He's one of the smartest in his class.

1501
02:03:16.806 --> 02:03:19.267
Yeah, it's okay. Go talk to him.

1502
02:03:28.610 --> 02:03:31.446
- What are you watching?
- Bert and Ernie.

1503
02:03:54.552 --> 02:03:56.346
Forrest,

1504
02:03:57.805 --> 02:03:59.349
I'm sick.

1505
02:04:02.018 --> 02:04:05.647
What, do you have
a cough due to a cold?

1506
02:04:05.730 --> 02:04:08.107
I have some kind of virus,

1507
02:04:08.191 --> 02:04:10.902
and the doctors don't...
They don't know what it is,

1508
02:04:11.027 --> 02:04:14.030
and there isn't anything
they can do about it.

1509
02:04:18.409 --> 02:04:20.703
You could come home with me.

1510
02:04:22.372 --> 02:04:28.044
Jenny, you and little Forrest could
come stay at my house in Greenbow.

1511
02:04:32.382 --> 02:04:35.176
I'll take care of you if you're sick.

1512
02:04:37.553 --> 02:04:39.847
Would you marry me, Forrest?

1513
02:04:45.103 --> 02:04:46.354
Okay.

1514
02:04:47.397 --> 02:04:49.065
MINISTER: Please take your seats.

1515
02:04:52.902 --> 02:04:55.238
Forrest? It's time to start.

1516
02:05:14.632 --> 02:05:16.217
Hi.

1517
02:05:17.093 --> 02:05:18.594
Your tie.

1518
02:05:31.149 --> 02:05:32.775
Lieutenant Dan.

1519
02:05:48.124 --> 02:05:50.084
Lieutenant Dan.

1520
02:05:50.918 --> 02:05:52.587
Hello, Forrest.

1521
02:05:53.254 --> 02:05:55.923
You got new legs. New legs!

1522
02:05:57.133 --> 02:06:00.928
Yeah. I got new legs. Custom-made.

1523
02:06:01.637 --> 02:06:05.641
Titanium alloy.
It's what they use on the space shuttle.

1524
02:06:09.479 --> 02:06:10.980
Magic legs.

1525
02:06:12.982 --> 02:06:17.361
This is my fiancée, Susan.

1526
02:06:20.156 --> 02:06:23.534
- Lieutenant Dan.
- Hi, Forrest.

1527
02:06:25.620 --> 02:06:28.831
Lieutenant Dan, this is my Jenny.

1528
02:06:29.207 --> 02:06:32.210
Hey. It's nice to meet you finally.

1529
02:06:42.345 --> 02:06:46.516
MINISTER: Do you, Forrest,
take Jenny to be your wife?

1530
02:06:48.392 --> 02:06:52.647
Do you, Jenny,
take Forrest to be your husband?

1531
02:06:53.981 --> 02:06:57.360
And so I pronounce you man and wife.

1532
02:07:28.224 --> 02:07:30.101
- Hey.
- Hey.

1533
02:07:43.781 --> 02:07:45.575
Hey, Forrest.

1534
02:07:50.913 --> 02:07:52.707
Were you scared in Vietnam?

1535
02:07:54.375 --> 02:07:56.711
Yes. Well, I...

1536
02:07:58.045 --> 02:07:59.755
I don't know.

1537
02:08:00.464 --> 02:08:05.428
<i>Sometimes it would stop raining long
enough for the stars to come out.</i>

1538
02:08:08.556 --> 02:08:10.600
<i>And then it was nice.</i>

1539
02:08:13.978 --> 02:08:17.940
It was like just before the sun
goes to bed down on the bayou.

1540
02:08:19.233 --> 02:08:23.112
<i>There was always
a million sparkles on the water.</i>

1541
02:08:24.906 --> 02:08:28.826
<i>Like that mountain lake.
It was so clear, Jenny,</i>

1542
02:08:28.951 --> 02:08:33.539
<i>it looked like there were two skies,
one on top of the other.</i>

1543
02:08:36.083 --> 02:08:39.128
And then, in the desert,
when the sun comes up,

1544
02:08:41.589 --> 02:08:45.760
<i>I couldn't tell where heaven stopped</i>

1545
02:08:46.302 --> 02:08:48.679
<i>and the earth began.</i>

1546
02:08:49.931 --> 02:08:51.807
<i>It was so beautiful.</i>

1547
02:08:56.520 --> 02:08:59.607
I wish I could've been there with you.

1548
02:09:02.693 --> 02:09:04.111
You were.

1549
02:09:14.830 --> 02:09:16.290
I love you.

1550
02:09:20.670 --> 02:09:24.006
<i>You died on a Saturday morning.</i>

1551
02:09:25.716 --> 02:09:29.470
And I had you placed
here under our tree.

1552
02:09:34.350 --> 02:09:39.188
And I had that house of your father's
bulldozed to the ground.

1553
02:09:43.317 --> 02:09:44.986
<i>Mama</i>

1554
02:09:46.070 --> 02:09:51.075
always said that dying was a part of life.

1555
02:09:54.495 --> 02:09:56.831
I sure wish it wasn't.

1556
02:09:59.500 --> 02:10:03.254
Little Forrest is doing just fine.

1557
02:10:04.588 --> 02:10:05.673
But...

1558
02:10:05.923 --> 02:10:08.592
<i>About to start school again soon,</i>

1559
02:10:10.428 --> 02:10:14.223
and I make his breakfast, lunch
and dinner every day.

1560
02:10:16.392 --> 02:10:22.398
I make sure he combs his hair
and brushes his teeth every day.

1561
02:10:25.526 --> 02:10:28.112
Teaching him how to play Ping-Pong.

1562
02:10:29.405 --> 02:10:30.448
Okay.

1563
02:10:30.698 --> 02:10:31.866
<i>He's really good.</i>

1564
02:10:31.949 --> 02:10:34.076
Forrest, you go.

1565
02:10:38.289 --> 02:10:39.874
<i>We fish a lot.</i>

1566
02:10:43.419 --> 02:10:46.881
(SOBBING) And every night, we read
a book. He's so smart, Jenny.

1567
02:10:50.134 --> 02:10:52.386
You'd be so proud of him.

1568
02:10:54.096 --> 02:10:55.556
I am.

1569
02:10:56.599 --> 02:10:59.810
He wrote you a letter.

1570
02:11:01.395 --> 02:11:03.439
And he says I can't read it.

1571
02:11:03.564 --> 02:11:07.109
I'm not supposed to,
so I'll just leave it here for you.

1572
02:11:23.167 --> 02:11:24.502
Jenny,

1573
02:11:30.299 --> 02:11:33.511
I don't know if Mama was right,

1574
02:11:34.845 --> 02:11:36.347
or if it's Lieutenant Dan.

1575
02:11:36.472 --> 02:11:39.058
I don't know

1576
02:11:39.141 --> 02:11:43.646
if we each have a destiny,

1577
02:11:45.689 --> 02:11:50.820
or if we're all just floating around
accidental-like on a breeze.

1578
02:11:55.324 --> 02:11:57.159
But I think

1579
02:11:59.036 --> 02:12:00.830
maybe it's both.

1580
02:12:05.167 --> 02:12:08.045
Maybe both is happening
at the same time.

1581
02:12:14.176 --> 02:12:16.178
But I miss you, Jenny.

1582
02:12:22.560 --> 02:12:26.981
If there's anything you need,
I won't be far away.

1583
02:13:02.266 --> 02:13:05.227
Here's your bus. Okay.

1584
02:13:06.896 --> 02:13:10.232
Hey. I know this.

1585
02:13:10.357 --> 02:13:13.235
I'm gonna show that
for show-and-tell because

1586
02:13:13.360 --> 02:13:16.030
Grandma used to read it to you.

1587
02:13:16.113 --> 02:13:18.240
My favorite book.

1588
02:13:21.577 --> 02:13:23.078
Here we are.

1589
02:13:23.245 --> 02:13:24.705
Okay.

1590
02:13:26.415 --> 02:13:27.917
Here you go.

1591
02:13:32.796 --> 02:13:35.299
Hey, Forrest, don't...

1592
02:13:38.761 --> 02:13:42.473
- I wanted to tell you, I love you.
- I love you, too, Daddy.

1593
02:13:44.475 --> 02:13:47.269
I'll be right here when you get back.

1594
02:13:51.815 --> 02:13:55.069
You understand this is
the bus to school, now, don't you?

1595
02:13:55.152 --> 02:13:58.697
Of course, and you are Dorothy Harris,
and I'm Forrest Gump.
