00:00:39.705 --> 00:00:43.503
<i>Do you remember the story
of a girl who lived a life of cinders,</i>

2
00:00:43.577 --> 00:00:47.637
<i>and how she found true love because
she kept a beautiful dream in her heart?</i>

3
00:00:49.211 --> 00:00:52.179
<i>Of course it helped that she had
mouse friends who could sew</i>

4
00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:55.318
<i>and a Fairy Godmother
who could do wonders with pumpkins.</i>

5
00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:58.651
<i>Well, that girl is me.</i>

6
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.100
Would my perfectly perfect
wife put on her perfectly fitting shoes?

7
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.763
You found my shoes.

8
00:01:26.403 --> 00:01:28.639
Better hurry.
Fairy Godmother's waiting.

9
00:01:28.707 --> 00:01:31.010
What were the mice
using them for this time?

10
00:01:31.076 --> 00:01:32.188
Boats.

11
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.209
There.

12
00:02:10.252 --> 00:02:11.911
Pathetic.

13
00:02:18.797 --> 00:02:20.292
Give me your hand.

14
00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:20.306
Surprise!

15
00:03:37.822 --> 00:03:41.271
So that's how Cinderella did it. Magic.

16
00:04:06.436 --> 00:04:07.582
Perfect!

17
00:04:13.445 --> 00:04:15.747
Mother! Mother!

18
00:04:16.871 --> 00:04:17.819
Mother!

19
00:04:17.894 --> 00:04:20.830
- Anastasia, where have you been?
- Slacking off again.

20
00:04:20.903 --> 00:04:23.752
Mother, our troubles are over!

21
00:04:25.128 --> 00:04:26.786
A stick?

22
00:04:26.856 --> 00:04:28.580
Ooh! Let's beat her with it.

23
00:04:28.649 --> 00:04:30.559
No, no, no, no. Not a stick.

24
00:04:30.633 --> 00:04:32.804
A magic wand.

25
00:04:32.873 --> 00:04:35.079
Well, she finally cracked.

26
00:04:35.147 --> 00:04:37.056
I saw this nutty old woman and zap!

27
00:04:37.131 --> 00:04:41.507
She gave Cinderella the beautiful gown
and, oh, the Prince.

28
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.258
- I blame the housework.
- Oh, I'll prove it to you.

29
00:04:45.325 --> 00:04:48.970
Oh, what were those words again?
Wappity-pappity-poo?

30
00:04:49.037 --> 00:04:51.721
Skip-skip-scadoo?
No, I know it. I know it. I think.

31
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.238
Oh, no I've got it. I've got it.
Bibbidi-bobbidi...

32
00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.717
Oh! There it is!

33
00:04:56.783 --> 00:04:58.758
Child, put that down!

34
00:04:58.831 --> 00:05:02.923
In the wrong hands that wand
could be extremely dangerous.

35
00:05:02.992 --> 00:05:06.026
Now, now give it back
to me you silly little goose.

36
00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:09.164
No way, Grandma.
Bibbidi-bobbidi boo!

37
00:05:22.356 --> 00:05:24.812
Look what you've done.

38
00:05:24.884 --> 00:05:26.860
Now give me back my wand.

39
00:05:26.932 --> 00:05:29.650
No, I need it,
you silly old garden gnome!

40
00:05:29.718 --> 00:05:31.311
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

41
00:05:39.384 --> 00:05:40.726
Oh!

42
00:05:40.792 --> 00:05:42.199
Oh-oh.

43
00:05:42.265 --> 00:05:45.014
Hello? Hello, hello, Grandma?

44
00:05:45.081 --> 00:05:47.023
Oooh! Oh!

45
00:05:47.097 --> 00:05:50.327
I... I'm sorry.
Oh, I didn't mean to hurt you.

46
00:05:50.394 --> 00:05:54.704
So this is how Cinderella did it.
What delicious irony.

47
00:05:54.778 --> 00:05:57.332
Do you realize what this means, girls?

48
00:05:57.403 --> 00:05:59.891
Yes! No more laundry!

49
00:06:01.468 --> 00:06:06.325
It means power, riches,

50
00:06:06.397 --> 00:06:08.253
revenge.

51
00:06:10.175 --> 00:06:11.931
Oh.

52
00:06:11.999 --> 00:06:14.105
I wanna be dirty, filthy, stinking rich!

53
00:06:14.176 --> 00:06:16.085
Oh, I want a Prince of my own!

54
00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:17.621
Oh please, please, please.

55
00:06:17.696 --> 00:06:19.453
- Give it to me!
- No, give it to me!

56
00:06:19.521 --> 00:06:21.179
Girls! Girls!

57
00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:24.032
First things first.

58
00:06:24.097 --> 00:06:26.366
Now, Cinderella,

59
00:06:26.433 --> 00:06:29.947
to undo your trickery
and take what's rightfully ours,

60
00:06:30.018 --> 00:06:33.532
I call upon
all the forces of the universe!

61
00:06:33.603 --> 00:06:36.353
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

62
00:06:53.799 --> 00:06:58.307
Reverse the moon and sun,
turn back tide and time,

63
00:06:58.377 --> 00:07:01.793
unravel Cinderella's happily ever after

64
00:07:01.866 --> 00:07:05.095
to the moment my troubles began!

65
00:07:37.585 --> 00:07:39.178
Stop!

66
00:07:44.018 --> 00:07:46.190
Wow.

67
00:07:49.331 --> 00:07:52.594
The Grand Duke!

68
00:07:54.069 --> 00:07:55.213
It worked.

69
00:07:55.284 --> 00:07:59.694
Magnificent!
And no one knows except us.

70
00:07:59.765 --> 00:08:01.871
Get ready. This is your second chance.

71
00:08:01.942 --> 00:08:03.503
Don't waste it.

72
00:08:03.575 --> 00:08:04.752
Where's Cinderella?

73
00:08:04.822 --> 00:08:07.441
She's exactly
where she was the first time.

74
00:08:07.511 --> 00:08:09.006
Cinderelly!

75
00:08:12.312 --> 00:08:13.905
The Grand Duke!

76
00:08:13.976 --> 00:08:15.220
Your Excellence.

77
00:08:15.288 --> 00:08:16.434
Your Grace.

78
00:08:16.505 --> 00:08:18.960
His Grace will now
read the royal procla...

79
00:08:19.033 --> 00:08:21.817
Pardon me, but we're all aware
of his grace's purpose.

80
00:08:21.883 --> 00:08:24.152
Perhaps we should just...
get on with it.

81
00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:28.055
Quite, Madame. Quite.

82
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:38.262
Ooh.

83
00:08:45.119 --> 00:08:47.007
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

84
00:08:50.528 --> 00:08:53.529
It fits!

85
00:08:53.601 --> 00:08:54.811
It fits?

86
00:08:55.297 --> 00:08:56.987
It fits!

87
00:08:58.881 --> 00:09:00.125
Mother, it fits.

88
00:09:00.193 --> 00:09:02.332
Gee. I wonder if it fits.

89
00:09:02.402 --> 00:09:04.738
It fits, it fits! Oh, Mother!

90
00:09:04.803 --> 00:09:06.713
I'm gonna get my Prince!

91
00:09:06.788 --> 00:09:08.381
Woo-hoo!

92
00:09:09.443 --> 00:09:11.713
Grace and poise, my dear!

93
00:09:14.853 --> 00:09:17.471
I hereby declare

94
00:09:17.542 --> 00:09:21.765
that we have found
the Prince's bride-to-be.

95
00:09:24.615 --> 00:09:27.201
We must return to the palace at once!

96
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:30.950
No. It can't be.

97
00:09:31.432 --> 00:09:33.505
Would Your Grace excuse me?

98
00:09:33.577 --> 00:09:36.742
I must have a word with my... maid.

99
00:09:38.666 --> 00:09:39.614
Oof!

100
00:09:41.899 --> 00:09:44.746
You look confused, dear.

101
00:09:44.812 --> 00:09:47.366
How could the slipper
have fit Anastasia?

102
00:09:47.437 --> 00:09:50.055
I danced with the Prince.
That was my slipper.

103
00:09:50.124 --> 00:09:53.441
Here, I have the other one.
I'm the one he's looking for.

104
00:09:53.517 --> 00:09:57.162
You may have danced with him.
You may even have thought it was love.

105
00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:01.933
But the slipper fits Anastasia,
and that's who he's marrying.

106
00:10:01.998 --> 00:10:05.708
Whatever you think happened
last night was a dream.

107
00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:14.987
I don't care where you go
or what you do,

108
00:10:15.057 --> 00:10:17.480
but you stay away from the palace.

109
00:10:17.555 --> 00:10:20.489
Stay away from the Prince.

110
00:10:24.243 --> 00:10:27.692
Oh and... clean up that broken glass.

111
00:10:51.385 --> 00:10:53.906
Duh... what just a-happened?

112
00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:58.102
I... I don't understand.

113
00:10:58.971 --> 00:11:00.378
I've...

114
00:11:54.119 --> 00:11:56.770
No, no. No cry, Gus Gus.

115
00:11:56.839 --> 00:11:59.043
Princey knows he danced with Cinderelly.

116
00:12:00.488 --> 00:12:03.206
Yes, of course he does.

117
00:12:03.752 --> 00:12:05.662
Oh, if I just see him again...

118
00:12:05.737 --> 00:12:07.679
Yeah, yeah, see Princey!

119
00:12:07.753 --> 00:12:10.120
Yes... everything will be alright.

120
00:12:10.185 --> 00:12:13.863
- Everything will be alright.
- Duh... yeah, yeah!

121
00:13:14.072 --> 00:13:16.493
Cinderelly, big blue guards.

122
00:13:16.567 --> 00:13:21.074
Gus Gus handle 'em.
Let me at 'em! Let me at 'em!

123
00:13:22.553 --> 00:13:25.815
Um... Let's try
the servant's entrance first.

124
00:13:29.947 --> 00:13:32.468
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

125
00:13:32.539 --> 00:13:34.198
- Onions for the King.
- Well done.

126
00:13:34.268 --> 00:13:35.249
Strawberries.

127
00:13:35.323 --> 00:13:37.495
Keep out of sight.

128
00:13:37.564 --> 00:13:40.663
The King is waiting. There you are.

129
00:13:40.733 --> 00:13:43.383
- The King will enjoy them.
- They're his favorite.

130
00:13:47.263 --> 00:13:48.375
Hmm?

131
00:14:08.867 --> 00:14:11.835
Now, all we have to do
is find him and everything will be...

132
00:14:11.907 --> 00:14:13.315
Stop! You there.

133
00:14:14.116 --> 00:14:16.418
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

134
00:14:16.484 --> 00:14:17.597
I...

135
00:14:17.668 --> 00:14:20.124
I'm in charge of all
the servants in this castle,

136
00:14:20.196 --> 00:14:22.052
and I've never seen you before.

137
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:24.700
What is your purpose?

138
00:14:24.775 --> 00:14:28.517
My purpose. Well... um... I...

139
00:14:28.583 --> 00:14:29.597
I...

140
00:14:30.088 --> 00:14:32.805
I'm the royal mouse catcher.

141
00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:36.550
Royal mouse catcher? Preposterous.

142
00:14:36.616 --> 00:14:38.689
Snap 'em and trap 'em.
That's my motto.

143
00:14:38.761 --> 00:14:39.906
Oh, no!

144
00:14:40.649 --> 00:14:43.967
In the 30 years
that I have supervised...

145
00:14:44.042 --> 00:14:46.530
...this castle,

146
00:14:46.602 --> 00:14:50.215
I can assure you there has never
ever been a single, solitary...

147
00:14:50.283 --> 00:14:52.194
Mouse!

148
00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:54.955
- Where is it?
- Mice!

149
00:15:01.486 --> 00:15:03.241
Oh, please, let me help.

150
00:15:04.047 --> 00:15:07.343
This is my kitchen.
I'll take care of it!

151
00:15:08.048 --> 00:15:11.344
Take that! And that! Vile vermin!

152
00:15:11.408 --> 00:15:12.783
Please, I can handle this!

153
00:15:12.849 --> 00:15:14.278
Not now!

154
00:15:14.352 --> 00:15:15.727
I've got them on the run!

155
00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:18.286
Really, I can help.

156
00:15:24.755 --> 00:15:27.406
There he is! I got him! I got him!

157
00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.196
So then, I'll just go get those mice.

158
00:15:40.695 --> 00:15:42.484
Come on, guys.

159
00:15:42.551 --> 00:15:44.241
Nice work.

160
00:15:44.311 --> 00:15:46.613
If we split up,
we'll find the Prince faster.

161
00:15:46.679 --> 00:15:48.087
Split up! Righty-o!

162
00:15:48.152 --> 00:15:51.283
- But, Dad...
- Those aren't reasons!

163
00:15:51.352 --> 00:15:54.768
Breeding, refinement!

164
00:15:54.841 --> 00:15:57.078
These are the reasons to marry someone.

165
00:15:57.145 --> 00:16:00.081
Not their choice
in transparent footwear!

166
00:16:02.458 --> 00:16:04.729
Ooh! Nice parry.

167
00:16:04.796 --> 00:16:05.744
Thanks.

168
00:16:07.772 --> 00:16:10.904
It's not about the slipper.
It's the girl in the slipper.

169
00:16:12.189 --> 00:16:14.807
She was... Well, she was...

170
00:16:14.877 --> 00:16:17.114
She was what?

171
00:16:17.182 --> 00:16:20.314
Well, she was the one.

172
00:16:20.382 --> 00:16:21.910
I know it.

173
00:16:25.248 --> 00:16:27.866
You think there's only
one woman in the kingdom

174
00:16:27.936 --> 00:16:29.911
who wears a size four and a half?

175
00:16:30.304 --> 00:16:31.734
It's all I have to go on here.

176
00:16:31.809 --> 00:16:33.369
Oh, poppycock!

177
00:16:42.947 --> 00:16:44.857
You remember when you met Mom?

178
00:16:48.005 --> 00:16:50.722
You said the first time
you touched her hand...

179
00:16:50.789 --> 00:16:52.894
...you just knew... instantly.

180
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:58.661
Mmm. The stars were brighter that night.

181
00:16:58.726 --> 00:17:01.726
Dad, you found true love.

182
00:17:01.799 --> 00:17:03.839
That's all I want.

183
00:17:03.911 --> 00:17:06.814
Oh! They found her!

184
00:17:17.386 --> 00:17:19.459
Zug-zug!

185
00:17:22.123 --> 00:17:25.768
Now, if you ladies
would please have a seat,

186
00:17:25.836 --> 00:17:28.203
the Prince will be right with you.

187
00:17:32.941 --> 00:17:34.600
My Prince!

188
00:17:36.942 --> 00:17:38.317
Your Highness!

189
00:17:38.383 --> 00:17:41.034
Oh, hello.

190
00:17:41.103 --> 00:17:45.480
Am I in the right room?
Of course I'm in the right room. Um...

191
00:17:45.553 --> 00:17:48.552
Well there... There seems to be...
a little mix-up here.

192
00:17:49.265 --> 00:17:53.292
I assure you, Your Highness,
the slipper fits my daughter's foot.

193
00:17:53.362 --> 00:17:55.271
See? See?

194
00:17:55.346 --> 00:17:56.972
Huh. How could he miss it?

195
00:17:57.043 --> 00:17:59.564
Oh, yeah, I see. Um...

196
00:17:59.635 --> 00:18:03.760
It's just that I was expecting...
Well, someone else.

197
00:18:03.828 --> 00:18:06.316
I really do feel awful about this.

198
00:18:06.389 --> 00:18:08.494
But the royal proclamation declared...

199
00:18:08.565 --> 00:18:12.974
Yes, but it would appear that,
uh, more than one girl

200
00:18:13.047 --> 00:18:15.730
actually fits the... the slipper.

201
00:18:15.798 --> 00:18:19.028
I'm very sorry
to have inconvenienced you. Um...

202
00:18:19.095 --> 00:18:23.220
Why don't I have the Grand Duke
escort you home safely.

203
00:18:23.288 --> 00:18:25.874
If you'll please excuse me.

204
00:18:25.945 --> 00:18:27.374
Phew!

205
00:18:28.345 --> 00:18:30.004
- But... but...
- Quiet!

206
00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:33.873
You will forget who you
danced with at the ball,

207
00:18:33.946 --> 00:18:36.336
and marry the girl
who fits the slipper...

208
00:18:36.411 --> 00:18:39.096
...tonight. Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

209
00:18:59.776 --> 00:19:02.459
Wait. Hold the trumpet!

210
00:19:02.528 --> 00:19:04.122
It's all coming back.

211
00:19:06.241 --> 00:19:07.485
It is you.

212
00:19:09.314 --> 00:19:11.419
Please. Please tell me your name.

213
00:19:11.939 --> 00:19:14.591
It's... Anastasia.

214
00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:16.416
Anastasia.

215
00:19:17.475 --> 00:19:20.891
Well, I... I know it's sudden,
but will you marry me?

216
00:19:20.964 --> 00:19:22.787
Yes! Yippee!

217
00:19:33.671 --> 00:19:35.013
Ah!

218
00:19:40.295 --> 00:19:41.245
Yes. Er...

219
00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:45.696
I... I mean, yes. Definitely yes.

220
00:19:45.769 --> 00:19:48.356
I will marry you.

221
00:19:48.427 --> 00:19:52.202
Excellent. The ceremony
will take place tonight.

222
00:19:52.267 --> 00:19:54.984
I trust that meets
with your approval, sire.

223
00:19:55.051 --> 00:19:56.906
The sooner the better.

224
00:19:56.971 --> 00:20:00.616
Splendid. Then tonight
we will have a new princess.

225
00:20:00.684 --> 00:20:02.627
Wonderful. I'll go tell my father.

226
00:20:02.701 --> 00:20:05.767
Not good! We have
to find Cinderelly, Gus Gus!

227
00:20:20.817 --> 00:20:23.884
I feel better already.

228
00:20:23.954 --> 00:20:29.357
Grace and poise, girls.
Just remember, grace and poise.

229
00:20:29.427 --> 00:20:32.361
Right. Grace and poise.

230
00:20:32.435 --> 00:20:34.575
Oh, look, a harp.

231
00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:48.053
Lucifer?

232
00:20:54.712 --> 00:20:56.119
Lucifer?

233
00:21:02.137 --> 00:21:05.334
Lucifer! Come here!

234
00:21:15.356 --> 00:21:18.139
Phew.

235
00:21:22.045 --> 00:21:23.834
Your Highness.

236
00:21:23.902 --> 00:21:25.146
Yes?

237
00:21:25.214 --> 00:21:27.418
Hello.

238
00:21:27.486 --> 00:21:29.756
Um... Hello.

239
00:21:29.823 --> 00:21:32.093
It's wonderful to see you again.

240
00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:35.805
Um... I'm sorry, have we met?

241
00:21:37.601 --> 00:21:40.732
I believe we danced
last night at the ball.

242
00:21:42.466 --> 00:21:46.940
Well, uh... maybe you've
mistaken me for some other prince.

243
00:21:50.051 --> 00:21:51.743
I don't think so.

244
00:21:51.812 --> 00:21:53.601
You are quite the dancer.

245
00:21:53.668 --> 00:21:55.043
Well, it wasn't just me.

246
00:21:55.109 --> 00:21:58.557
It was the lady I was...

247
00:21:58.629 --> 00:22:00.418
...dancing with.

248
00:22:08.487 --> 00:22:10.244
Oh, Your Highness.

249
00:22:10.312 --> 00:22:14.142
Uh... As a matter of fact,
I'm gonna marry her.

250
00:22:14.217 --> 00:22:16.289
Marry? Really?

251
00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:17.921
Yes! Tonight.

252
00:22:17.993 --> 00:22:19.204
Tonight?

253
00:22:19.274 --> 00:22:21.609
Once you dance
with someone like Anastasia,

254
00:22:21.674 --> 00:22:23.430
you don't want to waste any time.

255
00:22:23.498 --> 00:22:25.386
Did you say Anastasia?

256
00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:26.498
Yes.

257
00:22:27.083 --> 00:22:28.294
But...

258
00:22:33.326 --> 00:22:36.642
Well... I guess I better be going.

259
00:22:36.717 --> 00:22:38.091
I've got to tell my father.

260
00:22:38.158 --> 00:22:40.230
- But that's not right.
- I'm sorry?

261
00:22:40.302 --> 00:22:43.337
You there. Royal mouse catcher!
I need you this...

262
00:22:43.407 --> 00:22:47.663
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry,
Your Grace. I didn't realize...

263
00:22:47.728 --> 00:22:48.776
I was the one...

264
00:22:48.848 --> 00:22:51.815
I need her this instant!
Please excuse us, Your Highness?

265
00:22:51.889 --> 00:22:53.799
Please. I'm sorry, just one moment.

266
00:22:53.873 --> 00:22:56.524
No, no, no. Of course,
I can see you're busy.

267
00:22:56.593 --> 00:22:58.699
I'll... I'll let you go.

268
00:22:59.666 --> 00:23:03.015
But... it was me.

269
00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:22.740
Start here! I want this castle
completely rodent-free

270
00:23:22.806 --> 00:23:24.716
in time for the wedding.

271
00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:48.246
Cinderelly! Cinderelly!

272
00:23:48.317 --> 00:23:49.561
Gus?

273
00:23:49.629 --> 00:23:50.905
Cinderelly!

274
00:23:50.973 --> 00:23:52.467
Whoa!

275
00:23:52.541 --> 00:23:53.948
We found Princey!

276
00:23:54.014 --> 00:23:57.757
I did too. But he doesn't
even know who I am.

277
00:23:58.622 --> 00:23:59.638
No, no, no!

278
00:24:00.383 --> 00:24:02.074
It's a magic.

279
00:24:02.143 --> 00:24:03.998
What? What are you talking about?

280
00:24:08.896 --> 00:24:10.173
Stepmother?

281
00:24:11.937 --> 00:24:14.785
- Fairy Godmother?
- Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

282
00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:15.996
She stole it?

283
00:24:16.067 --> 00:24:17.889
I show Princey!

284
00:24:18.787 --> 00:24:20.380
Princey! Princey!

285
00:24:21.924 --> 00:24:23.779
My Cinderelly awaits.

286
00:24:23.844 --> 00:24:26.692
Princey, you will marry Anastasia.

287
00:24:26.757 --> 00:24:28.185
Anesthesia.

288
00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:30.683
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

289
00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:34.566
She made him forget who I am.

290
00:24:36.167 --> 00:24:39.780
Magic! That explains it.

291
00:24:41.511 --> 00:24:43.967
Boys, we have to get that wand!

292
00:24:44.424 --> 00:24:47.327
Madame, the King himself
has instructed me

293
00:24:47.402 --> 00:24:50.020
to be solely in charge of this affair.

294
00:24:50.089 --> 00:24:53.385
I assure you
I have it entirely under control.

295
00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:55.076
Oh, really?

296
00:24:59.691 --> 00:25:01.284
Look at that!

297
00:25:01.355 --> 00:25:03.178
It's perfect!

298
00:25:09.966 --> 00:25:11.876
They smell lovely.

299
00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:13.958
Dispose of those roses at once.

300
00:25:14.031 --> 00:25:15.787
Anastasia's health is quite...

301
00:25:15.855 --> 00:25:17.230
Ah-choo!

302
00:25:18.768 --> 00:25:20.044
...delicate.

303
00:25:20.111 --> 00:25:22.446
I'm quite sure
I mentioned that to you.

304
00:25:22.513 --> 00:25:26.026
- Madame, I do not...
- Quite sure.

305
00:25:27.025 --> 00:25:27.973
Yes.

306
00:25:28.049 --> 00:25:32.906
Well, perhaps the young ladies
would like to sample the hors d'oeuvres.

307
00:25:35.667 --> 00:25:37.577
Your Grace, a word.

308
00:25:39.027 --> 00:25:42.062
These preparations
are entirely unacceptable.

309
00:25:44.341 --> 00:25:45.967
What a pig!

310
00:25:48.982 --> 00:25:50.543
Who's the pig now?

311
00:25:55.095 --> 00:25:57.005
You call this a cake?

312
00:26:00.184 --> 00:26:02.770
This wedding must reflect
my daughter's elegance.

313
00:26:03.705 --> 00:26:06.389
Drizella will be singing
in the ceremony.

314
00:26:06.457 --> 00:26:08.367
Are you sure that's a good idea?

315
00:26:12.731 --> 00:26:15.579
Oh, wait till you meet her, Dad.
She has everything.

316
00:26:15.643 --> 00:26:18.808
- Breeding, refinement...
- Yes, yes.

317
00:26:22.205 --> 00:26:23.514
No!

318
00:26:27.262 --> 00:26:29.172
Are we in the right room?

319
00:26:29.245 --> 00:26:31.548
You! How could you let this happen?

320
00:26:31.615 --> 00:26:34.036
Don't mind this.

321
00:26:34.111 --> 00:26:36.500
I shall have it cleaned up in no time.

322
00:26:36.575 --> 00:26:38.364
See that you do!

323
00:26:38.432 --> 00:26:41.881
I want this wedding
to go off without a hitch.

324
00:26:41.953 --> 00:26:44.287
And if it doesn't...

325
00:26:45.346 --> 00:26:47.234
Oh, no! Please, sire...

326
00:26:47.298 --> 00:26:49.120
I can explain. I well, you see...

327
00:26:49.186 --> 00:26:53.530
Father, allow me to introduce
my bride-to-be, Anastasia.

328
00:26:53.636 --> 00:26:56.800
Anastasia, this is my dad.

329
00:26:56.835 --> 00:26:59.619
It is an honor, Your Majesty.

330
00:26:59.685 --> 00:27:02.271
Charmed, I'm sure.

331
00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:12.868
So who's up for a dance?

332
00:27:13.799 --> 00:27:17.662
Your little escapade back
there could have cost us everything!

333
00:27:17.736 --> 00:27:19.231
Don't ruin this!

334
00:27:19.305 --> 00:27:21.192
Go get him, twinkle toes.

335
00:27:29.835 --> 00:27:32.934
Oh, I don't dance much.

336
00:27:33.004 --> 00:27:36.299
You're too modest.
That's how we met, remember?

337
00:27:36.365 --> 00:27:38.470
Oh, right. Of course.

338
00:27:38.541 --> 00:27:41.159
I'll never forget
when I first touched...

339
00:27:42.158 --> 00:27:43.685
...your hand.

340
00:27:58.481 --> 00:27:59.976
Oh! I'm sorry.

341
00:28:00.049 --> 00:28:01.457
It won't happen again.

342
00:28:05.842 --> 00:28:08.178
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

343
00:28:10.132 --> 00:28:12.553
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

344
00:28:13.877 --> 00:28:17.138
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

345
00:28:17.204 --> 00:28:18.961
Oh!

346
00:28:26.134 --> 00:28:27.182
I'm sorry.

347
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:31.857
Oh, dear.

348
00:28:36.857 --> 00:28:38.450
Um... Are you OK?

349
00:28:39.674 --> 00:28:43.384
Oh! Oh, sorry, these aren't my shoes.

350
00:28:43.451 --> 00:28:46.680
I mean, what am I saying?
Of course they're my shoes.

351
00:28:46.746 --> 00:28:50.063
Oh, I just don't know
what's wrong with me today.

352
00:28:50.139 --> 00:28:52.212
Oh, no, no, it was my fault.

353
00:28:52.284 --> 00:28:55.449
I'm afraid I'm just not up-to-date
on the latest dance steps.

354
00:28:55.517 --> 00:28:59.446
Sire, if I may, um, your fitting.

355
00:28:59.518 --> 00:29:03.742
Oh. Oh, yes.
This was fun. Thank you.

356
00:29:03.807 --> 00:29:06.360
Well, if you'll please excuse me.

357
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.204
Um, come along, sire.

358
00:29:10.272 --> 00:29:13.437
And after the fitting,
we must approve the butter sculpture.

359
00:29:13.505 --> 00:29:15.512
I think it's a stunning likeness.

360
00:29:18.209 --> 00:29:20.861
Well, no grace, no poise.

361
00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:23.549
Other than that, it was lovely.

362
00:29:23.619 --> 00:29:26.238
He was nice to me.

363
00:29:26.308 --> 00:29:29.123
That's because
he's under a spell.

364
00:29:29.188 --> 00:29:32.222
He'd have to be, to fall for you.

365
00:29:33.957 --> 00:29:35.200
It's more than that.

366
00:29:35.268 --> 00:29:36.578
Ladies!

367
00:29:38.853 --> 00:29:40.796
Your Majesty!

368
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:45.629
I need to speak with my future
daughter-in-law immediately.

369
00:29:47.655 --> 00:29:49.281
Alone!

370
00:29:55.177 --> 00:29:57.666
Let's make a run for it while we can.

371
00:29:57.739 --> 00:30:01.962
No, sire, sire, I'll have a dozen
dance instructors sent in immediately.

372
00:30:02.027 --> 00:30:03.304
Something's wrong.

373
00:30:03.371 --> 00:30:05.575
An army of dance instructors.

374
00:30:05.643 --> 00:30:06.853
No, no.

375
00:30:06.923 --> 00:30:10.405
I thought... Why, I was sure
it was Anastasia last night.

376
00:30:10.476 --> 00:30:12.550
But...

377
00:30:12.621 --> 00:30:15.077
...well, just now when
I touched her hand...

378
00:30:16.399 --> 00:30:17.991
...I felt...

379
00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:20.718
...nothing.

380
00:30:21.743 --> 00:30:24.046
Oh, I can explain everything,
Your Majesty.

381
00:30:24.112 --> 00:30:26.446
I have this,
this inner ear thing and, and...

382
00:30:26.512 --> 00:30:30.058
You, my dear, are a dreadful dancer.

383
00:30:30.993 --> 00:30:33.612
Yes, I know, Your Majesty.

384
00:30:33.682 --> 00:30:35.755
Reminds me of my queen.

385
00:30:35.826 --> 00:30:38.281
She trod on my feet too.

386
00:30:39.315 --> 00:30:43.112
But she took very good care of my heart.

387
00:30:44.436 --> 00:30:46.160
Come here, my dear.

388
00:30:47.221 --> 00:30:49.742
I want to show you something.

389
00:30:52.501 --> 00:30:55.251
A princess is bestowed with many riches.

390
00:30:56.502 --> 00:30:59.569
Land, jewels, horses.

391
00:31:00.952 --> 00:31:05.044
But today I wish to give you
something much more valuable.

392
00:31:08.537 --> 00:31:09.486
Oh.

393
00:31:09.561 --> 00:31:11.155
Isn't it lovely?

394
00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:13.748
A seashell?

395
00:31:13.817 --> 00:31:18.096
This shell was the queen's
most treasured possession.

396
00:31:18.171 --> 00:31:22.678
We found it while
walking by the water the day we met.

397
00:31:22.748 --> 00:31:25.400
You see, we reached
for it at the same moment,

398
00:31:25.469 --> 00:31:28.852
and when our hands touched...

399
00:31:28.925 --> 00:31:32.570
...that's when I knew
I had found true love.

400
00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:36.889
You knew that just by touching her hand?

401
00:31:36.958 --> 00:31:42.655
There's no more powerful
force in the world than true love.

402
00:31:48.033 --> 00:31:51.547
Well, that's all. Run along, now.

403
00:31:51.618 --> 00:31:54.968
- Run along.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

404
00:31:55.458 --> 00:31:57.630
I do.

405
00:31:57.699 --> 00:31:59.129
Oh, I do.

406
00:32:00.323 --> 00:32:03.870
I do. I do.

407
00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:06.047
I really do.

408
00:32:08.869 --> 00:32:10.331
Oh!

409
00:32:13.382 --> 00:32:14.495
Oh, I do.

410
00:32:54.159 --> 00:32:56.265
You go get the Prince.

411
00:32:56.336 --> 00:32:58.409
Bigger!

412
00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:00.368
Ooh, let's try this!

413
00:33:01.616 --> 00:33:03.274
Oh, that's gorgeous.

414
00:33:07.794 --> 00:33:09.224
Lovely.

415
00:33:09.298 --> 00:33:12.200
Drizella, stop that this instant!

416
00:33:13.715 --> 00:33:16.301
This wand is not a toy.

417
00:33:16.371 --> 00:33:19.187
It's in the dresser.
Key's in her pocket.

418
00:33:23.221 --> 00:33:24.531
I've got to get in there.

419
00:33:24.598 --> 00:33:26.159
Cinderelly! They'll see you!

420
00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:27.888
- Yeah, too dangerous.
- But I...

421
00:33:27.958 --> 00:33:29.420
We'll take care of it!

422
00:33:29.494 --> 00:33:30.804
I do.

423
00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:33.139
I do.

424
00:33:33.239 --> 00:33:34.484
I do.

425
00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:38.805
I do. Oh, I do.

426
00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:50.004
Alright, but whatever you do,
stay clear of Lucifer.

427
00:33:50.075 --> 00:33:52.344
Zug-zug. No Lucifee.

428
00:33:53.275 --> 00:33:54.966
What happened?
What'd the King say?

429
00:33:56.316 --> 00:33:58.291
He's really very nice.

430
00:33:58.364 --> 00:34:01.015
He gave me his most prized possession.

431
00:34:01.085 --> 00:34:03.453
A seashell?

432
00:34:03.517 --> 00:34:05.176
It's a symbol of true love.

433
00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:08.700
Oh, please.

434
00:34:08.768 --> 00:34:13.590
- How special.
- He said that his heart...

435
00:34:13.664 --> 00:34:17.145
What's love compared
to the power we hold with the wand?

436
00:34:17.216 --> 00:34:19.256
You will learn that soon enough.

437
00:34:20.673 --> 00:34:22.812
I want the Prince to love me.

438
00:34:22.881 --> 00:34:24.769
I think he could.

439
00:34:24.834 --> 00:34:27.966
Oh, you're serious.

440
00:34:28.034 --> 00:34:30.456
Well, the King likes me too.

441
00:34:30.531 --> 00:34:34.176
He treated me like his own daughter.
Maybe we shouldn't be doing this.

442
00:34:34.659 --> 00:34:37.377
Maybe I should
have put on the slipper.

443
00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:40.804
Maybe we don't
even need the wand.

444
00:34:47.334 --> 00:34:48.349
Oh!

445
00:34:49.350 --> 00:34:51.839
Oh! Somebody put out the cat!

446
00:34:54.376 --> 00:34:57.825
Lucifer!
Oh, hold still! Stop!

447
00:35:08.492 --> 00:35:10.248
Lucifer!

448
00:35:10.796 --> 00:35:13.578
Someone fetch the housekeeper.

449
00:35:16.813 --> 00:35:18.537
Housekeeping.

450
00:35:22.222 --> 00:35:24.459
Well, you certainly came quickly.

451
00:35:24.526 --> 00:35:27.210
We're very good.

452
00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:35.786
Clean this up. My daughter needs her
beauty sleep before tonight's wedding.

453
00:35:35.856 --> 00:35:38.345
Think that'll be enough time?

454
00:35:53.269 --> 00:35:56.139
Keep out of the maid's way, girls.

455
00:35:56.212 --> 00:35:59.028
There's a lot to do before the wedding.

456
00:35:59.861 --> 00:36:01.684
Hmm?

457
00:36:05.271 --> 00:36:08.239
Isn't that right, Cinderella?

458
00:36:09.336 --> 00:36:11.988
I didn't know you worked here.

459
00:36:14.041 --> 00:36:16.278
You're far more persistent
than I thought.

460
00:36:16.345 --> 00:36:18.168
I won't let you get away with this.

461
00:36:18.234 --> 00:36:21.104
- We already have.
- I don't think so.

462
00:36:21.178 --> 00:36:22.706
Jaq! Gus!

463
00:36:25.691 --> 00:36:27.546
The wand!

464
00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:30.707
Us coming, Cinderelly!

465
00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:36.215
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

466
00:36:36.830 --> 00:36:39.678
That servant girl is a thief! Get her!

467
00:36:41.694 --> 00:36:43.004
Zug-zug.

468
00:36:44.896 --> 00:36:46.521
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

469
00:36:57.602 --> 00:36:59.358
Stop! Thief!

470
00:36:59.426 --> 00:37:01.948
- Seize her at once!
- Don't move! Hold it!

471
00:37:02.019 --> 00:37:03.448
Halt in the name of the King!

472
00:37:08.484 --> 00:37:10.175
Whoa!

473
00:37:11.941 --> 00:37:13.796
You incompetent fools!

474
00:37:17.382 --> 00:37:18.593
Whoa!

475
00:37:20.871 --> 00:37:23.489
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

476
00:37:30.601 --> 00:37:32.456
Gus Gus!

477
00:37:41.611 --> 00:37:43.368
Run, Gus Gus!

478
00:37:43.436 --> 00:37:44.898
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

479
00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:57.544
There she is! We've got her.

480
00:37:57.615 --> 00:37:58.989
You there, halt!

481
00:37:59.055 --> 00:38:00.910
Halt!

482
00:38:02.096 --> 00:38:04.006
Open up in the name of the King!

483
00:38:06.608 --> 00:38:08.584
Oh, hello.

484
00:38:08.658 --> 00:38:11.047
Oh! Hey! What's going on?

485
00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:13.544
Hmm.

486
00:38:13.618 --> 00:38:16.489
Uh... Alright, I'm coming.

487
00:38:16.563 --> 00:38:17.905
Cinderelly!

488
00:38:17.971 --> 00:38:19.497
Open up, I say!

489
00:38:19.571 --> 00:38:21.165
Gus Gus!

490
00:38:23.956 --> 00:38:25.232
Catch.

491
00:38:28.053 --> 00:38:29.908
Open up in the name of the King!

492
00:38:31.414 --> 00:38:33.454
Lift the spell. Let him remember.

493
00:38:34.102 --> 00:38:36.109
Bibbidi-bobbidi...!

494
00:38:37.175 --> 00:38:38.604
Ooh!

495
00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:41.712
No!

496
00:38:41.783 --> 00:38:43.791
- What's going on?
- My apologies.

497
00:38:43.865 --> 00:38:45.775
It's a problem with my maid.

498
00:38:45.849 --> 00:38:48.184
- It's under control.
- Are you OK?

499
00:38:48.249 --> 00:38:51.184
- This servant girl is a thief.
- I am not a thief.

500
00:38:51.258 --> 00:38:54.575
You're under a spell. That's why
you don't remember me. Please!

501
00:38:54.651 --> 00:38:55.699
Just listen!

502
00:39:01.212 --> 00:39:03.995
Let go!

503
00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:08.055
Poor child.
Obviously out of her mind.

504
00:39:08.126 --> 00:39:09.718
I hope she'll be alright.

505
00:39:09.789 --> 00:39:12.660
She seemed, you know,
nice when I met her.

506
00:39:12.735 --> 00:39:15.156
Well, maybe a little confused, but,

507
00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:17.270
still there's something about her...

508
00:39:17.344 --> 00:39:20.508
Oh, don't trouble yourself,
Your Highness.

509
00:39:20.608 --> 00:39:24.865
I'll see to it, personally,
that she gets all the help she needs.

510
00:39:24.897 --> 00:39:28.826
Nice try, but we won!

511
00:39:28.898 --> 00:39:31.233
You won? What do you mean?

512
00:39:31.842 --> 00:39:35.139
Uh... Well...

513
00:39:35.203 --> 00:39:36.610
...nothing.

514
00:39:37.508 --> 00:39:40.127
I... um...

515
00:39:40.196 --> 00:39:42.269
You'll see she's taken care of?

516
00:39:42.341 --> 00:39:44.578
Personally, Your Highness.

517
00:39:47.622 --> 00:39:49.989
Put her on the next ship
leaving the kingdom.

518
00:39:50.054 --> 00:39:52.323
I want her banished forever.

519
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:53.798
Mmm.

520
00:39:54.632 --> 00:39:56.158
And you...

521
00:39:56.231 --> 00:39:58.621
Keep your mouth shut or you're next.

522
00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:03.303
Quite fetching.

523
00:40:03.369 --> 00:40:04.417
Ouch!

524
00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:06.400
Careful with those pins down there.

525
00:40:06.473 --> 00:40:09.376
Dad, something strange is going on.

526
00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:12.963
I'll say.
My son is finally getting married.

527
00:40:13.035 --> 00:40:15.109
No. No, I mean something's wrong.

528
00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:19.337
Oh, nonsense, my boy. You wanted
the girl who fit the glass slipper.

529
00:40:19.437 --> 00:40:21.226
- Yes, but...
- Now you've got her.

530
00:40:21.261 --> 00:40:22.571
Hey.

531
00:40:22.638 --> 00:40:24.264
That's what I'm worried about.

532
00:40:24.334 --> 00:40:26.439
Psst! Hey, Princey! Prince!

533
00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:29.161
- Over here!
- Princey!

534
00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:30.954
Psst! Psst!

535
00:40:31.023 --> 00:40:33.926
- Me?
- Yes, you. Let's go.

536
00:40:36.976 --> 00:40:40.686
OK, first birds, now mice.

537
00:40:40.752 --> 00:40:42.247
Come on!

538
00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:57.998
Hello?

539
00:41:02.133 --> 00:41:05.582
Hello? Uh... little mice?

540
00:41:08.407 --> 00:41:11.506
Well, it's official. I've lost my mind.

541
00:41:11.575 --> 00:41:15.438
First I was hijacked by birds,
and now I'm talking to imaginary mice.

542
00:41:17.913 --> 00:41:20.631
Hey, Prince Prince! Down here!

543
00:41:20.698 --> 00:41:22.007
OK.

544
00:41:23.353 --> 00:41:25.361
Maybe not so imaginary.

545
00:41:25.434 --> 00:41:28.664
Stepmother got a magic wand,
put spell on you. Fooled everyone.

546
00:41:28.731 --> 00:41:30.520
...came to the palace to marry you!

547
00:41:30.587 --> 00:41:33.555
Wait, hold on. Hold on.
I think I understand.

548
00:41:35.005 --> 00:41:36.466
Actually, I got nothing.

549
00:41:38.109 --> 00:41:40.728
Duh... What should we gonna do?

550
00:41:41.310 --> 00:41:42.258
Ahh!

551
00:42:04.578 --> 00:42:06.783
No, I danced with Anastasia at the ball.

552
00:42:06.851 --> 00:42:11.107
No, no. Princey only think that
because of Cinderelly's stepmother.

553
00:42:11.172 --> 00:42:12.579
Yeah, mean old lady.

554
00:42:30.216 --> 00:42:31.460
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Wait!

555
00:42:31.528 --> 00:42:33.700
You're telling me
I'm under a magic spell?

556
00:42:33.769 --> 00:42:35.678
And here's the worst part.

557
00:42:45.131 --> 00:42:46.953
Gus Gus!

558
00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:48.035
Sorry.

559
00:43:10.032 --> 00:43:11.756
Magic?

560
00:43:11.825 --> 00:43:15.372
Magic made me think
Anastasia was the girl at the ball?

561
00:43:17.266 --> 00:43:19.121
That would explain everything.

562
00:43:19.186 --> 00:43:20.746
Yeah!

563
00:43:30.357 --> 00:43:32.659
What? The servant girl?

564
00:43:32.725 --> 00:43:36.271
This Cinderelly? This belongs to her?

565
00:43:36.342 --> 00:43:38.798
- Yeah! Yeah!
- I have to find her.

566
00:43:38.871 --> 00:43:41.686
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Yeah! Yeah!

567
00:43:43.159 --> 00:43:46.226
- One more time.
- Duh, yeah.

568
00:44:00.027 --> 00:44:02.100
Oh... thanks.

569
00:44:02.172 --> 00:44:04.277
And loved the song.

570
00:44:04.347 --> 00:44:06.737
- Go! Go! Go, Princey! Shoo! Shoo!
- Go! Go!

571
00:44:08.893 --> 00:44:10.322
I have to go.

572
00:44:10.397 --> 00:44:13.365
Go? But you're about to be married.

573
00:44:14.238 --> 00:44:16.759
But the talking mice
say she's the wrong girl.

574
00:44:16.830 --> 00:44:19.318
Son, wait!

575
00:44:20.191 --> 00:44:23.639
Son! Talking mice? Son?

576
00:44:23.711 --> 00:44:24.694
Whoo-hoo!

577
00:44:24.768 --> 00:44:27.070
- And two bluebirds.
- Talking bluebirds?

578
00:44:28.673 --> 00:44:31.455
No, the bluebirds
weren't talking. Look, Dad...

579
00:44:31.521 --> 00:44:32.983
This is ridiculous.

580
00:44:33.057 --> 00:44:35.480
You agreed to marry
the girl in the glass slipper.

581
00:44:35.555 --> 00:44:38.457
- I was completely with you on that one.
- And I will.

582
00:44:38.531 --> 00:44:40.735
- Huh?
- Just as soon as I find her.

583
00:44:40.803 --> 00:44:45.147
I forbid you to take
another step down these stairs!

584
00:44:47.236 --> 00:44:48.218
OK.

585
00:44:49.956 --> 00:44:52.575
Son! Come back!

586
00:44:52.645 --> 00:44:55.460
We'll find you a doctor.
We'll have you leeched.

587
00:44:58.917 --> 00:45:01.154
We've got to get...!

588
00:45:01.222 --> 00:45:04.835
Guards!

589
00:45:04.903 --> 00:45:06.365
Aye!

590
00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:09.190
The servant girl. Where is she?

591
00:45:09.256 --> 00:45:12.126
Guards! He's gone completely mad!

592
00:45:12.201 --> 00:45:13.925
- Your Majesty!
- Stop my son.

593
00:45:13.993 --> 00:45:15.935
Your blood pressure!

594
00:45:16.009 --> 00:45:17.984
Stop! Stop!

595
00:45:18.059 --> 00:45:19.367
Dad, trust me.

596
00:45:19.434 --> 00:45:22.434
Son! I do trust you.

597
00:45:22.507 --> 00:45:24.995
It's the talking mice I'm worried about.

598
00:45:26.667 --> 00:45:28.555
Hiyah!

599
00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:29.569
Son!

600
00:45:29.644 --> 00:45:31.946
Close the gates! Close the gates!

601
00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:41.892
It'll be fine. Don't look up.

602
00:45:42.768 --> 00:45:44.077
Hiyah! Hiyah!

603
00:45:47.248 --> 00:45:49.070
Good boy.

604
00:45:50.897 --> 00:45:53.231
- Yeah!
- Go get her, Princey!

605
00:45:55.667 --> 00:45:58.416
I'll send the troops after him
at once, Your Majesty.

606
00:45:58.482 --> 00:46:00.457
No, let him go.

607
00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:02.637
But... but, Your Majesty, the wedding.

608
00:46:02.708 --> 00:46:04.300
Let him go.

609
00:46:21.751 --> 00:46:23.508
Time to go.

610
00:46:32.954 --> 00:46:35.289
All hands on deck.

611
00:47:19.875 --> 00:47:22.461
Loose the mainsail!

612
00:47:41.577 --> 00:47:42.853
Hiyah!

613
00:48:09.646 --> 00:48:11.915
Come on, boy! Nothing to it.

614
00:48:15.248 --> 00:48:17.582
Hiyah!

615
00:48:49.494 --> 00:48:50.771
Remember me?

616
00:49:17.372 --> 00:49:20.406
Will you marry me, Cinderelly?

617
00:49:20.477 --> 00:49:24.439
Yes, but... actually,

618
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:26.233
it's Cinderella.

619
00:49:26.302 --> 00:49:28.953
Cinderella!

620
00:49:29.119 --> 00:49:31.541
- It's not over yet!
- What?

621
00:49:31.615 --> 00:49:34.365
He thinks he can ruin my plans.

622
00:49:34.432 --> 00:49:35.807
I think not.

623
00:49:35.872 --> 00:49:36.821
Who?

624
00:49:36.897 --> 00:49:39.897
The Prince. He's gone after Cinderella.

625
00:49:39.968 --> 00:49:43.482
- But I thought he loved me.
- Mother!

626
00:49:56.356 --> 00:49:57.950
Guards! Guards!

627
00:50:02.438 --> 00:50:04.446
It's no use. The magic didn't work.

628
00:50:04.518 --> 00:50:07.998
- It wasn't as powerful as their...
- You want the Prince to love you?

629
00:50:08.071 --> 00:50:09.053
Open up!

630
00:50:09.127 --> 00:50:10.688
Well, yes. Yes, of course I do.

631
00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:12.582
More than anything.

632
00:50:12.647 --> 00:50:15.201
- Then do exactly as I say.
- Open up!

633
00:50:15.272 --> 00:50:17.313
Open up in the name of the King!

634
00:50:19.433 --> 00:50:20.927
Huh?

635
00:50:21.674 --> 00:50:23.201
Hmm.

636
00:50:23.274 --> 00:50:26.723
Using magic on my son. The nerve.

637
00:50:26.796 --> 00:50:30.211
Your Majesty, we've gone over
every inch of the castle.

638
00:50:30.284 --> 00:50:31.713
It appears they have fled.

639
00:50:32.588 --> 00:50:34.890
Then search my entire kingdom!

640
00:50:34.956 --> 00:50:38.852
I want them found and arrested,
immediately!

641
00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:43.299
Keep in mind that I'm an old man

642
00:50:43.373 --> 00:50:46.222
and my heart can only take so much.

643
00:50:46.287 --> 00:50:48.491
Please, please, please,

644
00:50:48.559 --> 00:50:52.172
tell me that this is the girl
you intend to marry.

645
00:50:53.873 --> 00:50:58.446
All the stars are shining brighter,
Dad, just like you said.

646
00:50:58.514 --> 00:51:00.173
Then what are we waiting for?!

647
00:51:00.243 --> 00:51:04.750
Fetch the florist!
Bake an even bigger cake.

648
00:51:04.819 --> 00:51:07.569
The wedding is on tonight!

649
00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:13.716
Duh, no. This a way?

650
00:51:13.781 --> 00:51:15.636
Uh, uh, uh.

651
00:51:15.701 --> 00:51:17.557
No, no, no, no... thatta way.

652
00:51:17.622 --> 00:51:18.735
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

653
00:51:19.478 --> 00:51:20.689
Yes.

654
00:51:22.006 --> 00:51:23.632
Thank you.

655
00:51:24.823 --> 00:51:27.027
How lovely you look, my dear.

656
00:51:27.095 --> 00:51:28.372
Stepmother?

657
00:51:30.744 --> 00:51:32.687
Duh.

658
00:51:41.658 --> 00:51:43.863
It appears you were right, Cinderella.

659
00:51:44.443 --> 00:51:46.713
The Prince does want to marry you.

660
00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:49.747
And marry you he shall.

661
00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:51.544
Anastasia.

662
00:51:52.605 --> 00:51:53.620
Anastasia!

663
00:52:06.304 --> 00:52:09.600
Or should I say... "Cinderella."

664
00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:14.074
What have you done?

665
00:52:14.145 --> 00:52:16.032
The Prince won't be fooled.

666
00:52:16.098 --> 00:52:17.887
The Prince will never know.

667
00:52:17.954 --> 00:52:20.126
He'll be perfectly happy.

668
00:52:21.347 --> 00:52:25.122
But will you, Anastasia?
Will you be happy?

669
00:52:25.188 --> 00:52:28.123
I... I want what you had.

670
00:52:28.196 --> 00:52:30.585
But do you even love him?

671
00:52:30.661 --> 00:52:33.826
- I...
- Love! Look where it's gotten you.

672
00:52:35.430 --> 00:52:37.121
Cinderelly!

673
00:52:48.233 --> 00:52:49.661
Cinderelly!

674
00:52:49.736 --> 00:52:51.810
What's happened, Cinderelly?

675
00:53:09.357 --> 00:53:14.115
Lucifer, make absolutely certain
they don't come back...

676
00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:16.165
...alive.

677
00:53:16.239 --> 00:53:18.062
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

678
00:53:25.296 --> 00:53:26.823
Huh?

679
00:53:26.896 --> 00:53:29.450
Lucifer?

680
00:53:30.513 --> 00:53:32.619
Hiyah!

681
00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:48.809
We need to stop this thing.

682
00:53:48.885 --> 00:53:50.893
Right away, Cinderelly.

683
00:53:50.966 --> 00:53:52.722
OK, OK. Chop-chop.

684
00:53:58.039 --> 00:54:00.429
Gus, can you reach the pin?

685
00:54:00.504 --> 00:54:01.933
Zug-zug.

686
00:54:28.574 --> 00:54:30.166
Gus Gus!

687
00:54:33.567 --> 00:54:34.516
Jaq!

688
00:54:39.008 --> 00:54:41.277
Gus, hold on!

689
00:54:45.442 --> 00:54:47.264
Lucifer!

690
00:54:47.330 --> 00:54:48.988
Let him go!

691
00:54:51.522 --> 00:54:53.181
Gus!

692
00:54:59.428 --> 00:55:01.763
Huh?

693
00:55:02.693 --> 00:55:03.871
Bad kitty!

694
00:55:15.464 --> 00:55:16.741
Whoo-hoo!

695
00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:23.368
Jaq! Gus!

696
00:56:02.033 --> 00:56:03.310
Now what are we gonna do?

697
00:56:03.826 --> 00:56:06.063
Well, I'm not gonna miss my own wedding.

698
00:56:06.130 --> 00:56:07.625
Whoo-hoo!

699
00:56:24.502 --> 00:56:26.771
Oh, thank you, my dear.

700
00:56:26.838 --> 00:56:29.839
This is all his mother and I
have ever wanted.

701
00:56:29.911 --> 00:56:34.352
To know that our son
has found his true love.

702
00:56:34.424 --> 00:56:39.247
So, you know it's love
when you touch someone's hand, right?

703
00:56:39.321 --> 00:56:41.045
At least, that's what I've heard.

704
00:56:41.114 --> 00:56:44.660
Why, yes!
That's what I've always thought.

705
00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:15.226
Whoo-hoo!

706
00:57:38.118 --> 00:57:40.507
Dearly beloved...

707
00:57:40.582 --> 00:57:43.429
So far, so good, Your Majesty. Hmm?

708
00:57:43.494 --> 00:57:45.316
He's not married yet.

709
00:57:45.382 --> 00:57:48.231
...to join together this man

710
00:57:48.295 --> 00:57:50.205
and this woman...

711
00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:52.669
My one and only Cinderella.

712
00:57:52.744 --> 00:57:54.785
...in matrimony.

713
00:57:57.545 --> 00:58:00.546
We're almost there.

714
00:58:03.402 --> 00:58:04.351
Whoa!

715
00:58:08.907 --> 00:58:09.955
Halt!

716
00:58:10.028 --> 00:58:14.022
...Cinderella,
take this man as your lawfully

717
00:58:14.093 --> 00:58:15.654
wedded husband?

718
00:58:15.726 --> 00:58:18.824
You don't understand,
I must get inside.

719
00:58:18.894 --> 00:58:21.742
- Please.
- Just say it. Say, "I do."

720
00:58:21.806 --> 00:58:23.595
I...

721
00:58:25.135 --> 00:58:26.958
Duh.

722
00:58:32.049 --> 00:58:33.064
I...

723
00:58:35.377 --> 00:58:36.326
...don't.

724
00:58:38.098 --> 00:58:39.113
Anastasia.

725
00:58:39.763 --> 00:58:40.842
Cinderella.

726
00:58:44.147 --> 00:58:46.700
Spoiled little ingrate.

727
00:58:46.771 --> 00:58:49.739
I've given you everything
you ever wanted, Anastasia!

728
00:58:49.812 --> 00:58:52.365
But I want someone to love me, for me.

729
00:58:52.437 --> 00:58:55.786
Guards! Guards! Seize that woman!

730
00:58:58.102 --> 00:58:59.346
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

731
00:59:16.763 --> 00:59:20.724
- And now for you!
- Turn her into a toad, Mother.

732
00:59:20.795 --> 00:59:22.967
Stop! No more!

733
00:59:23.036 --> 00:59:25.491
- Even better.
- Cinderella!

734
00:59:25.564 --> 00:59:27.026
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

735
00:59:27.741 --> 00:59:28.886
No!

736
00:59:32.349 --> 00:59:33.778
No!

737
00:59:48.385 --> 00:59:52.925
This is the real Cinderella,
your true love.

738
01:00:04.933 --> 01:00:06.756
It's you.

739
01:00:23.143 --> 01:00:25.992
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

740
01:00:32.553 --> 01:00:35.272
I can't take much more of this.

741
01:00:37.931 --> 01:00:39.208
Anastasia.

742
01:00:46.157 --> 01:00:47.848
Thank you.

743
01:00:50.477 --> 01:00:52.714
Bibbidi-bobbidi...

744
01:00:53.807 --> 01:00:55.368
Boo.

745
01:00:57.615 --> 01:01:01.707
Oh, goodness! I certainly am stiff.

746
01:01:03.472 --> 01:01:04.967
Your Majesty...

747
01:01:05.681 --> 01:01:07.536
...I don't deserve this.

748
01:01:12.882 --> 01:01:16.396
Everyone deserves true love.

749
01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:22.606
Oh!

750
01:01:25.205 --> 01:01:27.594
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

751
01:01:30.903 --> 01:01:32.278
Thank you.

752
01:01:35.575 --> 01:01:39.023
Would you like me
to return you to your former lives?

753
01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:41.396
Former lives?

754
01:01:41.464 --> 01:01:44.116
Why, yes. You see, you two...

755
01:01:44.185 --> 01:01:46.422
Well, you were already...

756
01:01:47.418 --> 01:01:49.044
Oh, never mind.

757
01:01:49.114 --> 01:01:52.278
Well?
Does anyone want to marry my son?

758
01:01:55.612 --> 01:01:57.205
I do.

759
01:01:58.749 --> 01:02:01.596
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

760
01:02:34.691 --> 01:02:38.205
<i>And they lived
happily ever after...</i>

761
01:02:38.276 --> 01:02:40.186
<i>...again.</i>
