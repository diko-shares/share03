00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:42.751
Do you remember the story
of a girl who lived a life of cinders,

2
00:00:42.793 --> 00:00:44.628
and how she found true love

3
00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:47.631
because she kept a beautiful dream
in her heart?

4
00:00:48.674 --> 00:00:51.802
Of course it helped that she had
mouse friends who could sew

5
00:00:51.844 --> 00:00:55.055
and a Fairy Godmother
who could do wonders with pumpkins.

6
00:00:55.138 --> 00:00:57.516
Well, that girl is me.

7
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.355
CINDERELLA  3
A TWIST IN TIME

8
00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:08.610
What a perfectly perfect life
It's a fairy tale come true

9
00:01:08.694 --> 00:01:12.447
I'm a princess and a wife
all because I fit a shoe

10
00:01:12.531 --> 00:01:17.119
When I dreamed of love
who'd have guessed I'd end up here

11
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.414
At the end of a perfectly perfect year

12
00:01:20.455 --> 00:01:22.040
Would my perfectly perfect wife

13
00:01:22.124 --> 00:01:24.001
put on her perfectly fitting shoes?

14
00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:25.752
You found my shoes.

15
00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:29.798
Better hurry. Fairy Godmother's waiting.

16
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.259
What were the mice
using them for this time?

17
00:01:32.342 --> 00:01:33.510
Boats.

18
00:01:33.552 --> 00:01:34.553
There.

19
00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:43.770
Oh, what a wonderfully
perfectly perfect year!

20
00:01:47.816 --> 00:01:49.818
Why should we have to do the chores?

21
00:01:49.902 --> 00:01:51.737
I would rather rot in jail

22
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.780
Washing dishes and scrubbing floors

23
00:01:53.822 --> 00:01:55.616
That's just great
I broke a nail

24
00:01:55.657 --> 00:01:59.328
Cinderella is in the palace
living a life of luxury

25
00:01:59.411 --> 00:02:02.289
And we've not once
been invited to a ball

26
00:02:02.331 --> 00:02:04.917
-Or even tea
-Why don't I get a happy ending?

27
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.836
Where's the prince who'll marry me?

28
00:02:07.878 --> 00:02:12.716
When will this horrible
nightmare disappear?

29
00:02:13.217 --> 00:02:14.885
Pathetic.

30
00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:20.474
Oh, what a perfectly
miserably awful year

31
00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:23.644
Give me your hand.

32
00:02:33.946 --> 00:02:36.365
Somewhere there must be

33
00:02:36.406 --> 00:02:38.492
Someone who'll love me

34
00:02:38.534 --> 00:02:42.538
And show me a world that I never knew

35
00:02:42.621 --> 00:02:44.414
He'll ask for my hand

36
00:02:44.498 --> 00:02:46.625
And I'll say "I do"

37
00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:50.462
Oh, wouldn't it be finer than fine

38
00:02:50.546 --> 00:02:54.383
If that perfectly perfect love

39
00:02:54.424 --> 00:02:58.679
Were mine

40
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:06.520
He's a perfectly charming prince

41
00:03:06.562 --> 00:03:08.397
She's a charmingly perfect lass

42
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.567
They've lived happily ever
since she fit the slipper

43
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.277
Made of glass

44
00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:15.988
Take your places everyone

45
00:03:16.071 --> 00:03:20.200
The time is drawing near to celebrate

46
00:03:20.242 --> 00:03:23.412
A perfectly perfect year

47
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.164
Surprise!

48
00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:34.923
A perfect anniversary party

49
00:03:34.965 --> 00:03:36.633
That we planned for you

50
00:03:36.717 --> 00:03:38.093
And I threw in some magic

51
00:03:38.135 --> 00:03:40.470
With a bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

52
00:03:40.512 --> 00:03:44.391
Just like the night I sent you to the ball

53
00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:48.061
So that's how Cinderella did it. Magic.

54
00:03:48.103 --> 00:03:51.607
On this perfectly perfect day
there is magic in the air

55
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.527
Gee, I wonder if that old lady
has a wand that she could spare

56
00:03:55.611 --> 00:03:57.738
What could ever come between us?

57
00:03:57.779 --> 00:04:00.073
I would gladly volunteer

58
00:04:00.115 --> 00:04:02.201
And as for the future

59
00:04:02.284 --> 00:04:03.994
Well, it's perfectly clear

60
00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:08.582
-It's sure to be another magically
-Tragically

61
00:04:08.624 --> 00:04:14.171
Perfectly perfect year

62
00:04:14.213 --> 00:04:15.506
Perfect!

63
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.348
Mother! Mother!

64
00:04:25.057 --> 00:04:26.183
Mother!

65
00:04:26.225 --> 00:04:28.310
Anastasia, where have you been?

66
00:04:28.352 --> 00:04:32.356
-Slacking off again.
-Mother, our troubles are over!

67
00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:35.484
A stick?

68
00:04:35.651 --> 00:04:37.319
Let's beat her with it.

69
00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:39.404
No, no, no, no. Not a stick.

70
00:04:39.488 --> 00:04:41.740
A magic wand.

71
00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:44.117
Well, she finally cracked.

72
00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:45.953
I saw this nutty old woman and zap!

73
00:04:45.994 --> 00:04:50.832
She gave Cinderella the beautiful gown
and, oh, the Prince.

74
00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:54.753
-I blame the housework.
-I'll prove it to you.

75
00:04:54.837 --> 00:04:58.632
What were those words again?
Wappity-pappity-poo?

76
00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:01.510
Skip-skip-scadoo? No, I know it.
I know it. I think.

77
00:05:01.552 --> 00:05:05.180
Oh, no, I've got it. I've got it.
Bibbidi-bobbidi...

78
00:05:05.222 --> 00:05:06.723
There it is!

79
00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:08.851
Child, put that down!

80
00:05:08.892 --> 00:05:13.146
In the wrong hands that wand
could be extremely dangerous.

81
00:05:13.188 --> 00:05:16.358
Now, now give it back to me
you silly little goose.

82
00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:19.653
No way, Grandma. Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

83
00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:36.003
Look what you've done.

84
00:05:36.086 --> 00:05:38.130
Now give me back my wand.

85
00:05:38.213 --> 00:05:41.049
No, I need it,
you silly old garden gnome!

86
00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:42.759
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

87
00:05:54.146 --> 00:05:57.024
Hello? Hello... Hello, Grandma?

88
00:05:59.193 --> 00:06:02.571
I... I'm sorry.
Oh, I didn't mean to hurt you.

89
00:06:02.613 --> 00:06:07.117
So this is how Cinderella did it.
What delicious irony.

90
00:06:07.201 --> 00:06:09.870
Do you realize what this means, girls?

91
00:06:09.912 --> 00:06:12.539
Yes! No more laundry!

92
00:06:14.208 --> 00:06:19.296
It means power, riches,

93
00:06:19.338 --> 00:06:21.298
revenge.

94
00:06:25.177 --> 00:06:27.387
I wanna be dirty, filthy, stinking rich!

95
00:06:27.471 --> 00:06:29.473
I want a prince of my own!

96
00:06:29.515 --> 00:06:31.058
Please, please, please.

97
00:06:31.141 --> 00:06:32.976
-Give it to me!
-No, give it to me!

98
00:06:33.018 --> 00:06:34.728
Girls! Girls!

99
00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.689
First things first.

100
00:06:37.773 --> 00:06:40.108
Now, Cinderella,

101
00:06:40.192 --> 00:06:43.862
to undo your trickery
and take what's rightfully ours,

102
00:06:43.946 --> 00:06:47.616
I call upon all the forces of the universe!

103
00:06:47.658 --> 00:06:50.536
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

104
00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:13.475
Reverse the moon and sun,
turn back tide and time,

105
00:07:13.517 --> 00:07:17.104
unravel Cinderella's happily ever after

106
00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:20.482
to the moment my troubles began!

107
00:07:54.683 --> 00:07:56.310
Stop!

108
00:08:01.064 --> 00:08:03.358
-Wow.
-Wow.

109
00:08:07.988 --> 00:08:09.531
The Grand Duke!

110
00:08:11.533 --> 00:08:12.826
It worked.

111
00:08:12.868 --> 00:08:17.414
Magnificent!
And no one knows except us.

112
00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:21.376
Get ready. This is your second chance.
Don't waste it.

113
00:08:21.502 --> 00:08:22.753
Where's Cinderella?

114
00:08:22.794 --> 00:08:25.547
She's exactly where she was
the first time.

115
00:08:25.589 --> 00:08:27.174
Cinderelly!

116
00:08:30.594 --> 00:08:32.261
The Grand Duke!

117
00:08:32.346 --> 00:08:33.639
Your Excellence.

118
00:08:33.722 --> 00:08:34.932
Your Grace.

119
00:08:34.972 --> 00:08:37.558
His Grace will now read the royal...

120
00:08:37.601 --> 00:08:40.520
Pardon me, but we're all aware
of His Grace's purpose.

121
00:08:40.562 --> 00:08:42.898
Perhaps we should just get on with it.

122
00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:46.985
Quite, madam. Quite.

123
00:09:04.795 --> 00:09:06.880
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

124
00:09:12.386 --> 00:09:13.595
It fits!

125
00:09:13.637 --> 00:09:14.930
It fits?

126
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:17.182
It fits!

127
00:09:19.142 --> 00:09:20.477
Mother, it fits.

128
00:09:20.519 --> 00:09:22.729
Gee. I wonder if it fits.

129
00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:25.232
It fits, it fits! Oh, Mother!

130
00:09:25.274 --> 00:09:27.276
I'm gonna get my prince!

131
00:09:30.112 --> 00:09:32.489
Grace and poise, my dear!

132
00:09:36.451 --> 00:09:38.495
I hereby declare

133
00:09:38.579 --> 00:09:43.000
that we have found
the Prince's bride-to-be.

134
00:09:46.003 --> 00:09:48.672
We must return to the palace at once!

135
00:09:51.216 --> 00:09:52.593
No. It can't be.

136
00:09:53.177 --> 00:09:55.262
Would Your Grace excuse me?

137
00:09:55.345 --> 00:09:58.640
I must have a word with my maid.

138
00:10:03.979 --> 00:10:06.523
You look confused, dear.

139
00:10:06.982 --> 00:10:09.651
How could the slipper
have fit Anastasia?

140
00:10:09.735 --> 00:10:12.487
I danced with the Prince.
That was my slipper.

141
00:10:12.529 --> 00:10:15.991
Here, I have the other one.
I'm the one he's looking for.

142
00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:19.870
You may have danced with him.
You may even have thought it was love.

143
00:10:19.953 --> 00:10:24.833
But the slipper fits Anastasia,
and that's who he's marrying.

144
00:10:24.917 --> 00:10:28.837
Whatever you think happened
last night was a dream.

145
00:10:34.301 --> 00:10:38.514
I don't care where you go
or what you do,

146
00:10:38.555 --> 00:10:41.099
but you stay away from the palace.

147
00:10:41.183 --> 00:10:44.228
Stay away from the Prince.

148
00:10:48.106 --> 00:10:51.693
And clean up that broken glass.

149
00:11:16.426 --> 00:11:19.096
What just a-happened?

150
00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:23.433
I... I don't understand.

151
00:11:24.351 --> 00:11:25.811
I've...

152
00:11:26.812 --> 00:11:29.231
I've always dreamed

153
00:11:29.273 --> 00:11:32.025
That my life could be

154
00:11:32.067 --> 00:11:34.236
Like a fairy tale

155
00:11:34.319 --> 00:11:37.406
A perfect fantasy

156
00:11:37.489 --> 00:11:39.533
Every day a new adventure

157
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.911
On some undiscovered shore

158
00:11:42.953 --> 00:11:45.038
Was it nothing more

159
00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.498
Than a dream?

160
00:11:47.791 --> 00:11:50.210
Then one magic night

161
00:11:50.794 --> 00:11:53.338
With a single dance

162
00:11:53.422 --> 00:11:58.719
I found more than
just a storybook romance

163
00:11:58.802 --> 00:12:01.305
And for once my life was perfect

164
00:12:01.346 --> 00:12:03.932
As we glided 'cross the floor

165
00:12:03.974 --> 00:12:06.852
And it was so much more

166
00:12:06.935 --> 00:12:12.024
So much more than a dream

167
00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:14.651
I could say it never happened

168
00:12:14.735 --> 00:12:16.778
Just a dream from the start

169
00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.615
But then I'd live my life

170
00:12:19.656 --> 00:12:22.117
With a broken heart

171
00:12:22.659 --> 00:12:24.578
No, no. No cry, Gus-Gus.

172
00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:26.955
Princey knows he danced
with Cinderelly.

173
00:12:28.457 --> 00:12:31.293
Yes, of course he does.

174
00:12:31.376 --> 00:12:33.879
If I just see him again...

175
00:12:33.962 --> 00:12:36.006
Yeah, yeah, see Princey!

176
00:12:36.048 --> 00:12:38.509
Yes. Everything will be all right.

177
00:12:38.592 --> 00:12:42.429
-Everything will be all right.
-Duh... Yeah, yeah!

178
00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:48.101
'Cause in a prince's arms
I've found a love I can't deny

179
00:12:48.185 --> 00:12:50.812
If there's any chance to set things right

180
00:12:50.854 --> 00:12:54.775
I've simply got to try

181
00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:57.611
So I'll trust my heart

182
00:12:57.653 --> 00:12:59.988
What else can I do?

183
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:02.574
I can't live in dreams

184
00:13:02.658 --> 00:13:05.285
If my dreams are to come true

185
00:13:05.327 --> 00:13:07.579
There's a better life that's waiting

186
00:13:07.663 --> 00:13:10.332
Past the mountains I must climb

187
00:13:10.374 --> 00:13:16.296
I will take a chance on love
to get my once upon a time

188
00:13:20.926 --> 00:13:24.137
Oh, I want so much more

189
00:13:24.221 --> 00:13:27.391
So much more

190
00:13:27.432 --> 00:13:33.939
Than a dream

191
00:13:45.158 --> 00:13:47.703
Cinderelly, big blue guards.

192
00:13:49.371 --> 00:13:52.416
Gus-Gus handle 'em.
Let me at 'em! Let me at 'em!

193
00:13:55.002 --> 00:13:57.421
Let's try the servant's entrance first.

194
00:14:01.758 --> 00:14:04.386
-Good morning, sir.
-Good morning.

195
00:14:04.428 --> 00:14:06.096
-Onions for the King.
-Well done.

196
00:14:06.138 --> 00:14:07.264
Strawberries, sir.

197
00:14:08.348 --> 00:14:09.600
Keep out of sight.

198
00:14:09.683 --> 00:14:12.936
The King is waiting. There you are.

199
00:14:12.978 --> 00:14:16.899
-The King will enjoy them.
-They're his favorite.

200
00:14:42.299 --> 00:14:45.427
Now, all we have to do is find him
and everything will be...

201
00:14:45.469 --> 00:14:46.970
Stop! You there.

202
00:14:47.846 --> 00:14:50.140
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

203
00:14:50.182 --> 00:14:51.433
I...

204
00:14:51.475 --> 00:14:53.810
I'm in charge of all the servants
in this castle,

205
00:14:53.894 --> 00:14:56.063
and I've never seen you before.

206
00:14:56.813 --> 00:14:58.815
What is your purpose?

207
00:14:59.274 --> 00:15:02.778
My purpose. Well... I... I...

208
00:15:04.446 --> 00:15:06.281
I'm the royal mouse catcher.

209
00:15:07.282 --> 00:15:11.119
Royal mouse catcher? Preposterous.

210
00:15:11.203 --> 00:15:13.372
Snap 'em and trap 'em.
That's my motto.

211
00:15:13.455 --> 00:15:14.623
Oh, no!

212
00:15:15.499 --> 00:15:16.625
In the 30 years

213
00:15:16.708 --> 00:15:18.460
that I have supervised

214
00:15:20.504 --> 00:15:21.588
this castle,

215
00:15:21.672 --> 00:15:26.009
I can assure you there has never
ever been a single, solitary...

216
00:15:26.051 --> 00:15:27.511
Mouse!

217
00:15:28.929 --> 00:15:30.597
-Where is it?
-Mice!

218
00:15:37.187 --> 00:15:39.022
Oh, please, let me help.

219
00:15:39.982 --> 00:15:42.776
This is my kitchen. I'll take care of it!

220
00:15:43.986 --> 00:15:45.487
Take that!

221
00:15:45.529 --> 00:15:47.406
And that! Vile vermin!

222
00:15:47.489 --> 00:15:48.907
Please, I can handle this!

223
00:15:48.991 --> 00:15:50.492
Not now!

224
00:15:50.534 --> 00:15:51.994
I've got them on the run!

225
00:15:53.161 --> 00:15:54.663
Really, I can help.

226
00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:04.214
There he is! I got him! I got him!

227
00:16:07.176 --> 00:16:10.220
So then, I'll just go get those mice.

228
00:16:18.061 --> 00:16:19.897
Come on, guys.

229
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:21.732
Nice work.

230
00:16:21.773 --> 00:16:24.193
If we split up,
we'll find the Prince faster.

231
00:16:24.234 --> 00:16:25.694
Split up! Righty-o!

232
00:16:26.278 --> 00:16:29.031
-But, Dad...
-Those aren't reasons!

233
00:16:30.449 --> 00:16:32.701
Breeding, refinement!

234
00:16:32.743 --> 00:16:35.078
These are the reasons
to marry someone.

235
00:16:35.162 --> 00:16:38.207
Not their choice in transparent footwear!

236
00:16:41.835 --> 00:16:43.086
Nice parry.

237
00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:44.171
Thanks.

238
00:16:46.256 --> 00:16:49.551
It's not about the slipper.
It's the girl in the slipper.

239
00:16:50.886 --> 00:16:53.597
She was... Well, she was...

240
00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.016
She was what?

241
00:16:56.099 --> 00:16:59.353
Well, she was the one.

242
00:16:59.436 --> 00:17:01.021
I know it.

243
00:17:04.775 --> 00:17:07.194
You think there's only
one woman in the kingdom

244
00:17:07.236 --> 00:17:09.320
who wears a size four and a half?

245
00:17:09.946 --> 00:17:11.240
It's all I have to go on here.

246
00:17:11.281 --> 00:17:12.907
Oh, poppycock!

247
00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:24.962
You remember when you met Mom?

248
00:17:28.214 --> 00:17:31.051
You said the first time
you touched her hand

249
00:17:31.134 --> 00:17:33.303
you just knew, instantly.

250
00:17:36.139 --> 00:17:39.309
The stars were brighter that night.

251
00:17:39.393 --> 00:17:42.521
Dad, you found true love.

252
00:17:42.604 --> 00:17:44.731
That's all I want.

253
00:17:46.608 --> 00:17:47.985
They found her!

254
00:17:59.454 --> 00:18:01.623
Zug-zug!

255
00:18:03.792 --> 00:18:07.588
Now, if you ladies
would please have a seat,

256
00:18:07.671 --> 00:18:10.132
the Prince will be right with you.

257
00:18:15.053 --> 00:18:16.805
My Prince!

258
00:18:19.224 --> 00:18:20.684
Your Highness!

259
00:18:20.726 --> 00:18:23.520
Oh, hello.

260
00:18:23.562 --> 00:18:28.108
Am I in the right room?
Of course I'm in the right room.

261
00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:31.987
Well, there...
There seems to be a little mix-up here.

262
00:18:32.029 --> 00:18:36.241
I assure you, Your Highness,
the slipper fits my daughter's foot.

263
00:18:36.325 --> 00:18:38.327
See? See?

264
00:18:38.368 --> 00:18:40.078
How could he miss it?

265
00:18:40.162 --> 00:18:42.789
Yeah, I see.

266
00:18:42.831 --> 00:18:47.211
It's just that I was expecting...
Well, someone else.

267
00:18:47.252 --> 00:18:49.880
I really do feel awful about this.

268
00:18:49.922 --> 00:18:52.132
But the royal proclamation declared...

269
00:18:52.216 --> 00:18:56.803
Yes, but it would appear that
more than one girl

270
00:18:56.887 --> 00:18:59.681
actually fits the slipper.

271
00:18:59.723 --> 00:19:03.101
I'm very sorry
to have inconvenienced you.

272
00:19:03.185 --> 00:19:07.481
Why don't I have the Grand Duke
escort you home safely.

273
00:19:07.564 --> 00:19:10.234
If you'll please excuse me.

274
00:19:12.778 --> 00:19:14.530
-But... But...
-Quiet!

275
00:19:16.031 --> 00:19:18.534
You will forget who you danced
with at the ball,

276
00:19:18.617 --> 00:19:21.119
and marry the girl who fits the slipper

277
00:19:21.203 --> 00:19:23.997
tonight. Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

278
00:19:45.602 --> 00:19:48.397
Wait. Hold the trumpet!

279
00:19:48.438 --> 00:19:50.107
It's all coming back.

280
00:19:52.401 --> 00:19:53.694
It is you.

281
00:19:55.487 --> 00:19:57.698
Please. Please tell me your name.

282
00:19:58.282 --> 00:20:00.993
It's Anastasia.

283
00:20:01.702 --> 00:20:02.911
Anastasia.

284
00:20:03.996 --> 00:20:07.583
Well, I... I know it's sudden,
but will you marry me?

285
00:20:07.624 --> 00:20:09.001
Yes!

286
00:20:27.811 --> 00:20:28.812
Yes.

287
00:20:28.896 --> 00:20:33.442
I... I mean, yes. Definitely yes.

288
00:20:33.483 --> 00:20:35.444
I will marry you.

289
00:20:36.445 --> 00:20:40.199
Excellent.
The ceremony will take place tonight.

290
00:20:40.282 --> 00:20:43.285
I trust that meets
with your approval, Sire.

291
00:20:43.327 --> 00:20:45.120
The sooner the better.

292
00:20:45.162 --> 00:20:48.957
Splendid. Then tonight
we will have a new princess.

293
00:20:49.041 --> 00:20:51.084
Wonderful. I'll go tell my father.

294
00:20:51.168 --> 00:20:54.171
Not good!
We have to find Cinderelly, Gus-Gus!

295
00:21:10.062 --> 00:21:13.273
I feel better already.

296
00:21:13.357 --> 00:21:18.946
Grace and poise, girls.
Just remember, grace and poise.

297
00:21:18.987 --> 00:21:22.074
Right. Grace and poise.

298
00:21:22.157 --> 00:21:24.368
Oh, look, a harp.

299
00:21:35.546 --> 00:21:36.964
Lucifer?

300
00:21:45.389 --> 00:21:46.890
Lucifer?

301
00:21:53.146 --> 00:21:55.691
Lucifer! Come here!

302
00:22:14.293 --> 00:22:15.752
Your Highness.

303
00:22:15.836 --> 00:22:17.129
Yes?

304
00:22:17.212 --> 00:22:18.380
Hello.

305
00:22:20.632 --> 00:22:21.925
Hello.

306
00:22:22.009 --> 00:22:24.386
It's wonderful to see you again.

307
00:22:25.929 --> 00:22:28.223
I'm sorry, have we met?

308
00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:33.395
I believe we danced last night
at the ball.

309
00:22:35.189 --> 00:22:39.860
Well... Maybe you've mistaken me
for some other prince.

310
00:22:43.071 --> 00:22:44.823
I don't think so.

311
00:22:44.907 --> 00:22:46.742
You are quite the dancer.

312
00:22:46.825 --> 00:22:48.243
Well, it wasn't just me.

313
00:22:48.327 --> 00:22:51.914
It was the lady I was

314
00:22:51.997 --> 00:22:53.874
dancing with.

315
00:23:02.299 --> 00:23:04.134
Oh, Your Highness.

316
00:23:04.218 --> 00:23:08.222
As a matter of fact, I'm gonna marry her.

317
00:23:08.305 --> 00:23:10.474
Marry? Really?

318
00:23:10.516 --> 00:23:12.142
Yes! Tonight.

319
00:23:12.226 --> 00:23:13.477
Tonight?

320
00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.979
Once you dance
with someone like Anastasia,

321
00:23:16.063 --> 00:23:17.898
you don't want to waste any time.

322
00:23:17.981 --> 00:23:19.900
Did you say Anastasia?

323
00:23:19.942 --> 00:23:21.068
Yes.

324
00:23:21.652 --> 00:23:22.945
But...

325
00:23:28.158 --> 00:23:31.620
Well... I guess I better be going.

326
00:23:31.703 --> 00:23:33.121
I've got to tell my father.

327
00:23:33.205 --> 00:23:35.374
-But that's not right.
-I'm sorry?

328
00:23:35.457 --> 00:23:38.669
You there. Royal mouse catcher!
I need you this...

329
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:43.173
I'm sorry, Your Grace. I didn't realize...

330
00:23:43.215 --> 00:23:44.550
I was the one...

331
00:23:44.633 --> 00:23:47.511
I need her this instant!
Please excuse us, Your Highness?

332
00:23:47.553 --> 00:23:49.555
Please. I'm sorry, just one moment.

333
00:23:49.638 --> 00:23:52.391
No, no, no.
Of course, I can see you're busy.

334
00:23:52.474 --> 00:23:54.685
I'll... I'll let you go.

335
00:23:55.686 --> 00:23:59.189
But it was me.

336
00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:19.710
Start here! I want this castle
completely rodent-free

337
00:24:19.793 --> 00:24:21.795
in time for the wedding.

338
00:24:45.194 --> 00:24:46.361
Cinderelly! Cinderelly!

339
00:24:46.653 --> 00:24:47.654
Gus?

340
00:24:47.696 --> 00:24:49.031
Cinderelly!

341
00:24:50.699 --> 00:24:52.201
We found Princey!

342
00:24:52.284 --> 00:24:56.205
I did, too.
But he doesn't even know who I am.

343
00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:58.165
No, no, no!

344
00:24:58.916 --> 00:25:00.709
It's a-magic.

345
00:25:00.792 --> 00:25:02.753
What? What are you talking about?

346
00:25:07.841 --> 00:25:09.176
Stepmother?

347
00:25:11.011 --> 00:25:13.931
-Fairy Godmother?
-Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

348
00:25:13.972 --> 00:25:15.265
She stole it?

349
00:25:15.307 --> 00:25:17.226
-Boo-hoo-hoo!
-I show Princey!

350
00:25:18.143 --> 00:25:19.811
Princey! Princey!

351
00:25:21.438 --> 00:25:23.357
My Cinderelly awaits.

352
00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:26.360
Princey, you will marry Anastasia.

353
00:25:26.401 --> 00:25:27.903
Anesthesia.

354
00:25:27.986 --> 00:25:30.531
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

355
00:25:31.031 --> 00:25:34.243
She made him forget who I am.

356
00:25:36.703 --> 00:25:39.998
Magic! That explains it.

357
00:25:41.792 --> 00:25:44.294
Boys, we have to get that wand!

358
00:25:45.003 --> 00:25:48.215
Madame, the King himself
has instructed me

359
00:25:48.298 --> 00:25:50.717
to be solely in charge of this affair.

360
00:25:50.801 --> 00:25:54.221
I assure you I have it
entirely under control.

361
00:25:54.304 --> 00:25:55.973
Oh, really?

362
00:26:00.811 --> 00:26:02.479
Look at that!

363
00:26:02.521 --> 00:26:04.439
It's perfect!

364
00:26:11.446 --> 00:26:13.448
They smell lovely.

365
00:26:13.532 --> 00:26:15.617
Dispose of those roses at once.

366
00:26:15.701 --> 00:26:17.536
Anastasia's health is quite...

367
00:26:20.622 --> 00:26:21.957
...delicate.

368
00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.501
I'm quite sure I mentioned that to you.

369
00:26:24.585 --> 00:26:28.255
-Madam, I do not...
-Quite sure.

370
00:26:29.256 --> 00:26:30.299
Yes.

371
00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:33.427
Well, perhaps the young ladies

372
00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:35.429
would like to sample the hors d'oeuvres.

373
00:26:38.307 --> 00:26:40.309
Your Grace, a word.

374
00:26:41.894 --> 00:26:44.980
These preparations
are entirely unacceptable.

375
00:26:47.357 --> 00:26:49.026
What a pig!

376
00:26:52.154 --> 00:26:53.780
Who's the pig now?

377
00:26:58.493 --> 00:27:00.495
You call this a cake?

378
00:27:04.374 --> 00:27:07.461
This wedding must reflect
my daughter's elegance.

379
00:27:07.544 --> 00:27:10.339
Drizella will be singing in the ceremony.

380
00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:12.382
Are you sure that's a good idea?

381
00:27:16.929 --> 00:27:19.890
Wait till you meet her, Dad.
She has everything.

382
00:27:19.973 --> 00:27:23.268
-Breeding, refinement...
-Yes, yes.

383
00:27:26.813 --> 00:27:28.190
No!

384
00:27:32.027 --> 00:27:34.029
Are we in the right room?

385
00:27:34.112 --> 00:27:36.532
You! How could you let this happen?

386
00:27:36.573 --> 00:27:39.117
Don't mind this.

387
00:27:39.201 --> 00:27:41.703
I shall have it cleaned up in no time.

388
00:27:41.745 --> 00:27:43.622
See that you do!

389
00:27:43.705 --> 00:27:47.292
I want this wedding
to go off without a hitch.

390
00:27:47.376 --> 00:27:49.837
And if it doesn't...

391
00:27:50.921 --> 00:27:52.923
Oh, no! Please, Sire.

392
00:27:52.965 --> 00:27:54.883
I can explain. I, well, you see...

393
00:27:54.925 --> 00:27:59.471
Father, allow me introduce
my bride-to-be, Anastasia.

394
00:27:59.555 --> 00:28:02.850
Anastasia, this is my dad.

395
00:28:02.933 --> 00:28:05.811
It is an honor, Your Majesty.

396
00:28:05.894 --> 00:28:08.605
Charmed, I'm sure.

397
00:28:16.238 --> 00:28:19.575
So who's up for a dance?

398
00:28:20.617 --> 00:28:22.911
Your little escapade back there

399
00:28:22.995 --> 00:28:24.580
could have cost us everything!

400
00:28:24.663 --> 00:28:26.248
Don't ruin this!

401
00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:28.292
Go get him, twinkle toes.

402
00:28:37.301 --> 00:28:40.554
I don't dance much.

403
00:28:40.637 --> 00:28:44.057
You're too modest.
That's how we met, remember?

404
00:28:44.141 --> 00:28:46.310
Oh, right. Of course.

405
00:28:46.393 --> 00:28:49.146
I'll never forget when I first touched

406
00:28:50.147 --> 00:28:51.773
your hand.

407
00:29:07.122 --> 00:29:08.707
I'm sorry.

408
00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:10.292
It won't happen again.

409
00:29:14.838 --> 00:29:17.299
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

410
00:29:19.635 --> 00:29:21.762
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

411
00:29:24.223 --> 00:29:26.642
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

412
00:29:35.984 --> 00:29:37.069
I'm sorry.

413
00:29:38.237 --> 00:29:39.655
Oh, dear.

414
00:29:47.162 --> 00:29:48.830
Are you okay?

415
00:29:50.082 --> 00:29:54.002
Sorry, these aren't my shoes.

416
00:29:54.044 --> 00:29:57.422
I mean, what am I saying?
Of course they're my shoes.

417
00:29:57.506 --> 00:30:00.968
I just don't know
what's wrong with me today.

418
00:30:01.051 --> 00:30:03.220
Oh, no, no, it was my fault.

419
00:30:03.262 --> 00:30:06.557
I'm afraid I'm just not up-to-date
on the latest dance steps.

420
00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:10.727
Sire, if I may, your fitting.

421
00:30:10.811 --> 00:30:15.232
Oh, yes. This was fun. Thank you.

422
00:30:15.274 --> 00:30:17.943
Well, if you'll please excuse me.

423
00:30:20.237 --> 00:30:21.905
Come along, Sire.

424
00:30:21.989 --> 00:30:25.284
And after the fitting,
we must approve the butter sculpture.

425
00:30:25.367 --> 00:30:27.452
I think it's a stunning likeness.

426
00:30:30.706 --> 00:30:33.041
Well, no grace, no poise.

427
00:30:33.083 --> 00:30:35.878
Other than that, it was lovely.

428
00:30:35.919 --> 00:30:38.672
He was nice to me.

429
00:30:38.755 --> 00:30:41.675
That's because he's under a spell.

430
00:30:41.758 --> 00:30:44.928
He'd have to be, to fall for you.

431
00:30:46.722 --> 00:30:48.015
It's more than that.

432
00:30:48.098 --> 00:30:49.433
Ladies!

433
00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:53.854
Your Majesty!

434
00:30:53.937 --> 00:30:58.901
I need to speak with my
future daughter-in-law immediately.

435
00:31:00.944 --> 00:31:02.654
Alone!

436
00:31:08.785 --> 00:31:11.413
Let's make a run for it while we can.

437
00:31:11.455 --> 00:31:15.876
No, Sire, Sire, I'll have a dozen
dance instructors sent in immediately.

438
00:31:15.959 --> 00:31:17.294
Something's wrong.

439
00:31:17.377 --> 00:31:19.671
An army of dance instructors.

440
00:31:19.755 --> 00:31:21.006
No, no.

441
00:31:21.089 --> 00:31:24.718
I thought... Why, I was sure
it was Anastasia last night.

442
00:31:24.801 --> 00:31:26.970
But...

443
00:31:27.012 --> 00:31:29.598
Well, just now when I touched her hand,

444
00:31:30.974 --> 00:31:32.643
I felt

445
00:31:33.977 --> 00:31:35.479
nothing.

446
00:31:36.605 --> 00:31:38.899
I can explain everything, Your Majesty.

447
00:31:38.982 --> 00:31:41.443
I have this... This inner ear thing and...

448
00:31:41.485 --> 00:31:45.197
You, my dear, are a dreadful dancer.

449
00:31:46.114 --> 00:31:48.867
Yes, I know, Your Majesty.

450
00:31:48.951 --> 00:31:51.119
Reminds me of my queen.

451
00:31:51.161 --> 00:31:53.580
She trod on my feet, too.

452
00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:58.836
But she took
very good care of my heart.

453
00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:02.005
Come here, my dear.

454
00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:05.717
I want to show you something.

455
00:32:08.595 --> 00:32:11.473
A princess is bestowed
with many riches.

456
00:32:12.766 --> 00:32:15.978
Land, jewels, horses.

457
00:32:17.396 --> 00:32:21.692
But today I wish to give you
something much more valuable.

458
00:32:26.321 --> 00:32:27.990
Isn't it lovely?

459
00:32:28.991 --> 00:32:30.701
A seashell?

460
00:32:30.784 --> 00:32:35.247
This shell was the queen's
most treasured possession.

461
00:32:35.789 --> 00:32:40.043
We found it while walking
by the water the day we met.

462
00:32:40.085 --> 00:32:42.880
You see, we reached for it
at the same moment,

463
00:32:42.963 --> 00:32:46.508
and when our hands touched

464
00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:50.387
that's when I knew I had found true love.

465
00:32:51.638 --> 00:32:54.892
You knew that
just by touching her hand?

466
00:32:54.933 --> 00:33:00.898
There's no more powerful force
in the world than true love.

467
00:33:06.445 --> 00:33:10.115
Well, that's all. Run along, now.

468
00:33:10.199 --> 00:33:13.702
-Run along.
-Thank you, Your Majesty.

469
00:33:14.203 --> 00:33:16.455
I do.

470
00:33:16.538 --> 00:33:18.040
Oh, I do.

471
00:33:19.249 --> 00:33:23.003
I do. I do.

472
00:33:23.086 --> 00:33:25.255
I really do.

473
00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:34.097
Oh, I do.

474
00:33:37.893 --> 00:33:42.356
Now there is finally someone
to love me

475
00:33:42.439 --> 00:33:46.944
He'll show me a world
that I never knew

476
00:33:46.985 --> 00:33:52.115
With two simple words
all my dreams will come true

477
00:33:52.157 --> 00:33:53.992
I do

478
00:33:54.076 --> 00:34:00.499
I do

479
00:34:15.429 --> 00:34:17.641
You go get the Prince.

480
00:34:17.683 --> 00:34:19.851
Bigger!

481
00:34:19.935 --> 00:34:21.895
Let's try this!

482
00:34:23.188 --> 00:34:24.940
Oh, that's gorgeous.

483
00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:31.112
Lovely.

484
00:34:31.154 --> 00:34:34.199
Drizella, stop that this instant!

485
00:34:35.784 --> 00:34:38.453
This wand is not a toy.

486
00:34:38.536 --> 00:34:41.456
It's in the dresser. Key's in her pocket.

487
00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:47.087
I've got to get in there.

488
00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:48.797
Cinderelly! They'll see you!

489
00:34:48.839 --> 00:34:50.591
-Yeah, too dangerous.
-But I...

490
00:34:50.674 --> 00:34:52.176
We'll take care of it!

491
00:34:52.259 --> 00:34:53.635
I do.

492
00:34:54.094 --> 00:34:57.431
I do. I do.

493
00:34:58.182 --> 00:35:01.977
I do. I do.

494
00:35:09.484 --> 00:35:13.614
All right, but whatever you do,
stay clear of Lucifer.

495
00:35:13.655 --> 00:35:15.824
Zug-zug. No Lucifee.

496
00:35:16.992 --> 00:35:18.744
What happened?
What did the King say?

497
00:35:20.162 --> 00:35:22.247
He's really very nice.

498
00:35:22.331 --> 00:35:25.083
He gave me
his most prized possession.

499
00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:27.669
A seashell?

500
00:35:27.711 --> 00:35:30.047
It's a symbol of true love.

501
00:35:30.756 --> 00:35:32.382
Oh, please.

502
00:35:34.218 --> 00:35:38.222
-How special.
-He said that his heart...

503
00:35:38.305 --> 00:35:42.059
What is love compared
to the power we hold with the wand?

504
00:35:42.142 --> 00:35:44.144
You will learn that soon enough.

505
00:35:45.604 --> 00:35:47.856
I want the Prince to love me.

506
00:35:47.898 --> 00:35:49.900
I think he could.

507
00:35:49.942 --> 00:35:53.695
Oh, you're serious.

508
00:35:53.737 --> 00:35:55.781
Well, the King likes me, too.

509
00:35:55.864 --> 00:35:59.660
He treated me like his own daughter.
Maybe we shouldn't be doing this.

510
00:36:00.285 --> 00:36:02.996
Maybe I should have put on the slipper.

511
00:36:04.164 --> 00:36:06.583
Maybe we don't even need the wand.

512
00:36:15.551 --> 00:36:18.095
Somebody put out the cat!

513
00:36:20.764 --> 00:36:24.351
Lucifer! Oh, hold still! Stop!

514
00:36:35.404 --> 00:36:37.239
Lucifer!

515
00:36:39.283 --> 00:36:40.909
Someone fetch the housekeeper.

516
00:36:44.079 --> 00:36:45.914
Housekeeping.

517
00:36:49.793 --> 00:36:52.129
Well, you certainly came quickly.

518
00:36:52.171 --> 00:36:54.965
We're very good.

519
00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:03.932
Clean this up. My daughter needs her
beauty sleep before tonight's wedding.

520
00:37:03.974 --> 00:37:05.642
Think that'll be enough time?

521
00:37:22.451 --> 00:37:25.120
Keep out of the maid's way, girls.

522
00:37:25.162 --> 00:37:28.123
There's a lot to do before the wedding.

523
00:37:34.671 --> 00:37:37.758
Isn't that right, Cinderella?

524
00:37:39.676 --> 00:37:41.637
I didn't know you worked here.

525
00:37:43.805 --> 00:37:46.141
You're far more persistent
than I thought.

526
00:37:46.183 --> 00:37:48.101
I won't let you get away with this.

527
00:37:48.185 --> 00:37:51.188
-We already have.
-I don't think so.

528
00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:52.856
Jaq! Gus!

529
00:37:55.901 --> 00:37:57.861
The wand!

530
00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:01.156
Us a-coming, Cinderelly!

531
00:38:04.826 --> 00:38:06.620
Yeah!

532
00:38:07.496 --> 00:38:10.499
That servant girl is a thief! Get her!

533
00:38:12.584 --> 00:38:14.002
Zug-zug.

534
00:38:15.963 --> 00:38:17.673
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

535
00:38:29.226 --> 00:38:31.061
Stop! Thief!

536
00:38:31.103 --> 00:38:33.730
-Seize her at once!
-Don't move! Hold it!

537
00:38:33.814 --> 00:38:35.315
Halt in the name of the King!

538
00:38:44.116 --> 00:38:46.034
You incompetent fools!

539
00:38:53.417 --> 00:38:56.211
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

540
00:39:03.594 --> 00:39:05.095
Gus-Gus!

541
00:39:15.105 --> 00:39:16.940
Run, Gus-Gus!

542
00:39:16.982 --> 00:39:18.525
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

543
00:39:29.494 --> 00:39:31.663
There she is! We've got her.

544
00:39:31.747 --> 00:39:33.165
You there, halt!

545
00:39:33.248 --> 00:39:34.333
Halt!

546
00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:38.462
Open up in the name of the King!

547
00:39:41.131 --> 00:39:43.217
Oh, hello.

548
00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:45.802
Oh! Hey! What's going on?

549
00:39:49.598 --> 00:39:51.475
All right, I'm coming.

550
00:39:51.517 --> 00:39:52.935
Cinderelly!

551
00:39:52.976 --> 00:39:54.603
Open up, I say!

552
00:39:54.645 --> 00:39:55.938
Gus-Gus!

553
00:39:59.233 --> 00:40:00.567
Catch.

554
00:40:03.487 --> 00:40:05.405
Open up in the name of the King!

555
00:40:06.949 --> 00:40:09.117
Lift the spell. Let him remember.

556
00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:11.870
Bibbidi-bobbidi...

557
00:40:16.041 --> 00:40:17.751
No!

558
00:40:17.793 --> 00:40:19.920
-What's going on?
-My apologies.

559
00:40:20.003 --> 00:40:22.005
It's a problem with my maid.

560
00:40:22.047 --> 00:40:24.508
-It's under control.
-Are you okay?

561
00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:27.636
-This servant girl is a thief.
-I am not a thief.

562
00:40:27.678 --> 00:40:31.181
You're under a spell. That's why
you don't remember me. Please!

563
00:40:31.223 --> 00:40:32.349
Just listen!

564
00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:40.983
Let go!

565
00:40:41.942 --> 00:40:45.195
Poor child. Obviously out of her mind.

566
00:40:45.279 --> 00:40:46.947
I hope she'll be all right.

567
00:40:46.989 --> 00:40:49.992
She seemed, you know,
nice when I met her.

568
00:40:50.033 --> 00:40:52.578
Well, maybe a little confused, but,

569
00:40:52.661 --> 00:40:54.788
still there's something about her...

570
00:40:54.830 --> 00:40:58.166
Oh, don't trouble yourself,
Your Highness.

571
00:40:58.208 --> 00:41:02.713
I'll see to it, personally,
that she gets all the help she needs.

572
00:41:02.754 --> 00:41:06.884
Nice try, but we won!

573
00:41:06.925 --> 00:41:09.386
You won? What do you mean?

574
00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:12.514
Well...

575
00:41:13.515 --> 00:41:14.975
Nothing.

576
00:41:15.893 --> 00:41:17.186
I...

577
00:41:18.729 --> 00:41:20.898
You'll see she's taken care of?

578
00:41:20.939 --> 00:41:23.275
Personally, Your Highness.

579
00:41:26.445 --> 00:41:28.906
Put her on the next ship
leaving the kingdom.

580
00:41:28.947 --> 00:41:31.325
I want her banished forever.

581
00:41:33.702 --> 00:41:35.329
And you...

582
00:41:35.370 --> 00:41:37.873
Keep your mouth shut or you're next.

583
00:41:40.375 --> 00:41:42.002
Quite fetching.

584
00:41:44.254 --> 00:41:46.048
Careful with those pins down there.

585
00:41:46.924 --> 00:41:49.134
Dad, something strange is going on.

586
00:41:49.218 --> 00:41:52.888
I'll say. My son is finally getting married.

587
00:41:52.930 --> 00:41:55.098
No. No, I mean something's wrong.

588
00:41:55.182 --> 00:41:59.520
Oh, nonsense, my boy. You wanted
the girl who fit the glass slipper.

589
00:41:59.603 --> 00:42:01.438
-Yes, but...
-Now you've got her.

590
00:42:01.522 --> 00:42:02.898
Hey.

591
00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:04.650
That's what I'm worried about.

592
00:42:04.733 --> 00:42:05.943
Hey, Princey! Prince!

593
00:42:06.109 --> 00:42:08.570
-Over here!
-Princey!

594
00:42:11.657 --> 00:42:14.701
-Me?
-Yes, you. Let's go.

595
00:42:17.871 --> 00:42:21.750
Okay, first birds, now mice.

596
00:42:21.792 --> 00:42:23.377
Come on!

597
00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:39.810
Hello?

598
00:42:44.147 --> 00:42:47.359
Hello? Little mice?

599
00:42:50.654 --> 00:42:53.907
Well, it's official. I've lost my mind.

600
00:42:53.949 --> 00:42:57.953
First I was hijacked by birds,
and now I'm talking to imaginary mice.

601
00:43:01.623 --> 00:43:03.375
Hey, Prince-Prince! Down here!

602
00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:04.793
Okay.

603
00:43:06.587 --> 00:43:08.338
Maybe not so imaginary.

604
00:43:08.422 --> 00:43:11.800
Stepmother got a magic wand,
put spell on you. Fooled everyone.

605
00:43:11.842 --> 00:43:13.719
...came to the palace to marry you!

606
00:43:13.802 --> 00:43:16.889
Wait, hold on. Hold on.
I think I understand.

607
00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:19.933
Actually, I got nothing.

608
00:43:22.644 --> 00:43:24.188
What should we gonna do?

609
00:43:31.069 --> 00:43:33.530
You were dancing
with a very pretty girl

610
00:43:33.572 --> 00:43:35.282
-Pretty girl
-At midnight she ran off

611
00:43:35.324 --> 00:43:37.159
-In such a whirl
-Such a whirl

612
00:43:37.242 --> 00:43:40.037
Her name was Cinderelly
She's the servant girl you met

613
00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:41.580
She's the one you want to marry

614
00:43:41.663 --> 00:43:43.332
Don't forget!
Don't forget!

615
00:43:43.373 --> 00:43:46.376
-At the ball, at the ball
-At the ball, at the ball

616
00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:49.171
Cinderelly was the maiden at the ball

617
00:43:49.213 --> 00:43:51.548
No, I danced with Anastasia at the ball.

618
00:43:51.965 --> 00:43:56.053
No, no. Princey only think that
because of Cinderelly's stepmother.

619
00:43:56.094 --> 00:43:58.388
Yeah, mean old lady.

620
00:43:58.430 --> 00:44:00.516
With a magic wand
she cast a wicked spell

621
00:44:00.557 --> 00:44:01.892
Wicked spell

622
00:44:01.934 --> 00:44:03.769
Which is why Princey isn't feeling well

623
00:44:03.852 --> 00:44:05.854
-Not so well
-You've forgotten Cinderelly

624
00:44:05.896 --> 00:44:07.731
And the dance you shared last night

625
00:44:07.814 --> 00:44:10.234
But we know it's not too late
to set things right

626
00:44:10.275 --> 00:44:12.819
'Cause at the ball!
At the ball! At the ball!

627
00:44:12.903 --> 00:44:15.864
-Yeah, at the ball
-Cinderelly was the maiden at the ball

628
00:44:15.906 --> 00:44:17.199
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Wait!

629
00:44:17.282 --> 00:44:19.535
You're telling me
I'm under a magic spell?

630
00:44:19.576 --> 00:44:21.620
And here's the worst part.

631
00:44:21.703 --> 00:44:24.081
When Cinderelly tried her best
to take a stand

632
00:44:24.164 --> 00:44:25.207
Take a stand

633
00:44:25.249 --> 00:44:28.252
Mean old lady had her
banished from the land

634
00:44:31.505 --> 00:44:33.423
Gus-Gus!

635
00:44:33.465 --> 00:44:34.591
Sorry.

636
00:44:35.592 --> 00:44:38.428
Cinderelly's on a ship
that's gonna sail her far away

637
00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:40.597
It's up to Princey-Prince
to save the day

638
00:44:40.681 --> 00:44:42.349
'Cause at the ball
At the ball

639
00:44:42.432 --> 00:44:44.142
-At the ball
-What a ball

640
00:44:44.226 --> 00:44:45.727
Cinderelly won your heart

641
00:44:45.769 --> 00:44:47.271
Now magic's keeping you apart

642
00:44:47.312 --> 00:44:48.772
And she'll soon be gone forever

643
00:44:48.856 --> 00:44:50.774
Unless you can recall

644
00:44:50.816 --> 00:44:55.946
That Cinderelly
was the maiden at the ball

645
00:44:55.988 --> 00:44:57.364
At the ball!

646
00:44:57.406 --> 00:44:58.490
Magic?

647
00:44:59.283 --> 00:45:02.995
Magic made me think Anastasia
was the girl at the ball?

648
00:45:04.955 --> 00:45:06.915
That would explain everything.

649
00:45:06.957 --> 00:45:08.584
Yeah!

650
00:45:18.635 --> 00:45:21.054
What? The servant girl?

651
00:45:21.138 --> 00:45:24.808
This Cinderelly? This belongs to her?

652
00:45:24.892 --> 00:45:27.477
-Yeah! Yeah!
-I have to find her.

653
00:45:27.519 --> 00:45:30.480
-Yeah! Yeah!
-Yeah! Yeah!

654
00:45:31.982 --> 00:45:35.194
-One more time.
-Yeah.

655
00:45:35.277 --> 00:45:37.154
At the ball! At the ball!

656
00:45:37.237 --> 00:45:39.239
We showed ol' Princey after all

657
00:45:39.281 --> 00:45:43.118
That Cinderelly was the maiden

658
00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:46.663
At the ball!

659
00:45:49.541 --> 00:45:51.752
Oh, thanks.

660
00:45:51.835 --> 00:45:54.004
And loved the song.

661
00:45:54.087 --> 00:45:56.590
-Go! Go! Go, Princey! Shoo! Shoo!
-Go! Go!

662
00:45:59.009 --> 00:46:00.344
I have to go.

663
00:46:00.385 --> 00:46:03.180
Go? But you're about to be married.

664
00:46:04.389 --> 00:46:07.017
But the talking mice
say she's the wrong girl.

665
00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:09.686
Son, wait!

666
00:46:10.771 --> 00:46:14.066
Son! Talking mice? Son?

667
00:46:15.359 --> 00:46:17.778
-And two bluebirds.
-Talking bluebirds?

668
00:46:19.446 --> 00:46:22.324
No, the bluebirds weren't talking.
Look, Dad...

669
00:46:22.366 --> 00:46:23.909
This is ridiculous.

670
00:46:23.992 --> 00:46:26.495
You agreed to marry the girl
in the glass slipper.

671
00:46:26.537 --> 00:46:29.623
-I was completely with you on that one.
-And I will.

672
00:46:30.791 --> 00:46:32.000
Just as soon as I find her.

673
00:46:32.084 --> 00:46:36.630
I forbid you
to take another step down these stairs!

674
00:46:38.799 --> 00:46:39.842
Okay.

675
00:46:41.635 --> 00:46:44.388
Son! Come back!

676
00:46:44.429 --> 00:46:47.391
We'll find you a doctor.
We'll have you leeched.

677
00:46:50.978 --> 00:46:53.313
We've got to get...

678
00:46:53.397 --> 00:46:55.274
Guards!

679
00:46:58.819 --> 00:47:01.697
The servant girl. Where is she?

680
00:47:02.072 --> 00:47:04.741
Guards! He's gone completely mad!

681
00:47:04.783 --> 00:47:06.577
-Your Majesty!
-Stop my son.

682
00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:08.704
Your blood pressure!

683
00:47:08.745 --> 00:47:10.831
Stop! Stop!

684
00:47:10.873 --> 00:47:12.249
Dad, trust me.

685
00:47:12.332 --> 00:47:15.502
Son! I do trust you.

686
00:47:15.586 --> 00:47:18.172
It's the talking mice I'm worried about.

687
00:47:21.925 --> 00:47:22.926
Son!

688
00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:25.429
Close the gates! Close the gates!

689
00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:35.772
It'll be fine. Don't look up.

690
00:47:41.361 --> 00:47:43.280
Good boy.

691
00:47:45.115 --> 00:47:47.576
-Yeah!
-Go get her, Princey!

692
00:47:50.078 --> 00:47:52.956
I'll send the troops after him at once,
Your Majesty.

693
00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:55.083
No, let him go.

694
00:47:55.209 --> 00:47:57.419
But... But, Your Majesty, the wedding.

695
00:47:57.461 --> 00:47:59.129
Let him go.

696
00:48:17.314 --> 00:48:19.149
Time to go.

697
00:48:28.951 --> 00:48:31.411
All hands on deck.

698
00:48:52.558 --> 00:48:55.561
I've always dreamed

699
00:48:55.644 --> 00:48:58.856
That my life could be

700
00:48:58.897 --> 00:49:01.316
Like a fairy tale

701
00:49:01.358 --> 00:49:05.153
A perfect fantasy

702
00:49:11.410 --> 00:49:14.079
But it was nothing more

703
00:49:15.163 --> 00:49:17.833
Than a dream

704
00:49:17.875 --> 00:49:20.627
Loose the mainsail!

705
00:50:09.801 --> 00:50:12.179
Come on, boy! Nothing to it.

706
00:50:51.343 --> 00:50:52.678
Remember me?

707
00:51:20.372 --> 00:51:23.584
Will you marry me, Cinderelly?

708
00:51:23.625 --> 00:51:26.503
Yes, but...

709
00:51:26.587 --> 00:51:29.673
Actually, it's Cinderella.

710
00:51:29.715 --> 00:51:32.509
Cinderella!

711
00:51:33.093 --> 00:51:35.179
-It's not over yet!
-What?

712
00:51:35.262 --> 00:51:38.140
He thinks he can ruin my plans.

713
00:51:38.182 --> 00:51:40.684
-I think not.
-Who?

714
00:51:40.767 --> 00:51:43.896
The Prince. He's gone after Cinderella.

715
00:51:43.979 --> 00:51:47.649
-But I thought he loved me.
-Mother!

716
00:52:00.996 --> 00:52:02.664
Guards! Guards!

717
00:52:07.377 --> 00:52:10.214
It's no use. The magic didn't work.

718
00:52:10.297 --> 00:52:11.882
It wasn't as powerful as their...

719
00:52:11.924 --> 00:52:14.301
-You want the Prince to love you?
-Open up!

720
00:52:14.384 --> 00:52:16.303
Well, yes. Yes, of course I do.

721
00:52:16.386 --> 00:52:17.971
More than anything.

722
00:52:18.055 --> 00:52:20.724
-Then do exactly as I say.
-Open up!

723
00:52:20.766 --> 00:52:22.893
Open up in the name of the King!

724
00:52:29.107 --> 00:52:32.736
Using magic on my son. The nerve.

725
00:52:32.778 --> 00:52:36.365
Your Majesty, we've gone over
every inch of the castle.

726
00:52:36.406 --> 00:52:37.908
It appears they have fled.

727
00:52:38.784 --> 00:52:41.203
Then search my entire kingdom!

728
00:52:41.245 --> 00:52:45.332
I want them found and arrested,
immediately!

729
00:52:48.001 --> 00:52:50.003
Keep in mind that I'm an old man

730
00:52:50.087 --> 00:52:53.048
and my heart can only take so much.

731
00:52:53.090 --> 00:52:55.425
Please, please, please,

732
00:52:55.467 --> 00:52:59.263
tell me that this is the girl
you intend to marry.

733
00:53:01.306 --> 00:53:03.600
All the stars are shining brighter, Dad,

734
00:53:03.684 --> 00:53:05.769
just like you said.

735
00:53:05.853 --> 00:53:07.604
Then what are we waiting for?

736
00:53:08.897 --> 00:53:12.359
Fetch the florist!
Bake an even bigger cake.

737
00:53:12.442 --> 00:53:15.279
The wedding is on tonight!

738
00:53:17.781 --> 00:53:21.702
No. This a way?

739
00:53:23.745 --> 00:53:25.664
No, no, no, no, thatta way.

740
00:53:25.747 --> 00:53:26.915
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

741
00:53:27.708 --> 00:53:28.917
Yes.

742
00:53:30.335 --> 00:53:32.045
Thank you.

743
00:53:33.297 --> 00:53:35.591
How lovely you look, my dear.

744
00:53:35.632 --> 00:53:36.967
Stepmother?

745
00:53:50.814 --> 00:53:53.150
It appears you were right, Cinderella.

746
00:53:53.817 --> 00:53:56.111
The Prince does want to marry you.

747
00:53:56.153 --> 00:53:59.281
And marry you he shall.

748
00:53:59.323 --> 00:54:01.158
Anastasia.

749
00:54:02.201 --> 00:54:03.285
Anastasia!

750
00:54:16.507 --> 00:54:19.968
Or should I say "Cinderella."

751
00:54:22.971 --> 00:54:24.640
What have you done?

752
00:54:24.681 --> 00:54:26.683
The Prince won't be fooled.

753
00:54:26.725 --> 00:54:28.602
The Prince will never know.

754
00:54:28.685 --> 00:54:30.938
He'll be perfectly happy.

755
00:54:32.189 --> 00:54:36.151
But will you, Anastasia?
Will you be happy?

756
00:54:36.193 --> 00:54:39.279
I... I want what you had.

757
00:54:39.363 --> 00:54:41.865
But do you even love him?

758
00:54:41.907 --> 00:54:45.202
-I...
-Love! Look where it's gotten you.

759
00:54:46.828 --> 00:54:48.622
Cinderelly!

760
00:55:00.217 --> 00:55:01.718
Cinderelly!

761
00:55:01.802 --> 00:55:03.971
What's happened, Cinderelly?

762
00:55:22.656 --> 00:55:26.243
Lucifer, make absolutely certain
they don't come back

763
00:55:27.244 --> 00:55:29.329
alive.

764
00:55:29.371 --> 00:55:31.290
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

765
00:55:42.009 --> 00:55:43.218
Lucifer?

766
00:56:01.904 --> 00:56:03.405
We need to stop this thing.

767
00:56:03.447 --> 00:56:05.574
Right away, Cinderelly.

768
00:56:05.616 --> 00:56:07.451
Okay, okay. Chop-chop.

769
00:56:13.332 --> 00:56:15.501
Gus, can you reach the pin?

770
00:56:15.584 --> 00:56:17.085
Zug-zug.

771
00:56:44.821 --> 00:56:46.490
Gus-Gus!

772
00:56:49.993 --> 00:56:51.036
Jaq!

773
00:56:55.707 --> 00:56:58.085
Gus, hold on!

774
00:57:02.589 --> 00:57:04.341
Lucifer!

775
00:57:04.383 --> 00:57:06.134
Let him go!

776
00:57:08.762 --> 00:57:10.514
Gus!

777
00:57:20.399 --> 00:57:21.650
Bad kitty!

778
00:57:40.002 --> 00:57:41.962
Jaq! Gus!

779
00:58:22.211 --> 00:58:23.587
Now what are we gonna do?

780
00:58:24.254 --> 00:58:26.465
Well, I'm not gonna
miss my own wedding.

781
00:58:45.692 --> 00:58:48.070
Oh, thank you, my dear.

782
00:58:48.111 --> 00:58:51.281
This is all his mother
and I have ever wanted.

783
00:58:51.657 --> 00:58:55.953
To know that our son
has found his true love.

784
00:58:55.994 --> 00:59:00.916
So, you know it's love when
you touch someone's hand, right?

785
00:59:00.999 --> 00:59:02.960
At least, that's what I've heard.

786
00:59:03.001 --> 00:59:06.713
Why, yes!
That's what I've always thought.

787
01:00:02.436 --> 01:00:04.938
Dearly beloved...

788
01:00:05.022 --> 01:00:07.983
So far, so good, Your Majesty.

789
01:00:08.025 --> 01:00:09.943
He's not married yet.

790
01:00:10.027 --> 01:00:12.988
...to join together this man

791
01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:15.032
and this woman...

792
01:00:15.115 --> 01:00:17.618
My one and only Cinderella.

793
01:00:17.659 --> 01:00:19.786
...in matrimony.

794
01:00:22.664 --> 01:00:25.792
We're almost there.

795
01:00:34.426 --> 01:00:35.636
Halt!

796
01:00:35.719 --> 01:00:39.890
...Cinderella, take this man
as your lawfully

797
01:00:39.932 --> 01:00:41.558
wedded husband?

798
01:00:41.642 --> 01:00:44.895
You don't understand, I must get inside.

799
01:00:44.937 --> 01:00:47.898
-Please.
-Just say it. Say, "I do."

800
01:00:47.981 --> 01:00:49.066
I...

801
01:00:58.659 --> 01:00:59.743
I

802
01:01:02.079 --> 01:01:03.080
don't.

803
01:01:04.915 --> 01:01:05.999
Anastasia.

804
01:01:06.708 --> 01:01:07.793
Cinderella.

805
01:01:11.255 --> 01:01:13.924
Spoiled little ingrate.

806
01:01:14.007 --> 01:01:17.094
I've given you everything
you ever wanted, Anastasia!

807
01:01:17.177 --> 01:01:19.847
But I want someone to love me, for me.

808
01:01:19.930 --> 01:01:23.433
Guards! Guards! Seize that woman!

809
01:01:25.811 --> 01:01:27.104
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

810
01:01:45.747 --> 01:01:49.376
-And now for you!
-Turn her into a toad, Mother.

811
01:01:49.459 --> 01:01:51.753
Stop! No more!

812
01:01:51.795 --> 01:01:54.381
-Even better.
-Cinderella!

813
01:01:54.464 --> 01:01:55.966
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

814
01:01:56.717 --> 01:01:57.926
No!

815
01:02:01.513 --> 01:02:03.015
No!

816
01:02:18.238 --> 01:02:22.993
This is the real Cinderella,
your true love.

817
01:02:35.506 --> 01:02:37.382
It's you.

818
01:02:54.483 --> 01:02:57.444
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

819
01:03:04.284 --> 01:03:07.120
I can't take much more of this.

820
01:03:09.831 --> 01:03:11.208
Anastasia.

821
01:03:18.465 --> 01:03:20.217
Thank you.

822
01:03:22.970 --> 01:03:25.305
Bibbidi-bobbidi...

823
01:03:26.431 --> 01:03:27.516
Boo.

824
01:03:30.394 --> 01:03:34.690
Oh, goodness! I certainly am stiff.

825
01:03:36.525 --> 01:03:38.068
Your Majesty,

826
01:03:38.819 --> 01:03:40.737
I don't deserve this.

827
01:03:46.326 --> 01:03:49.538
Everyone deserves true love.

828
01:03:59.173 --> 01:04:01.675
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

829
01:04:05.262 --> 01:04:06.555
Thank you.

830
01:04:09.975 --> 01:04:13.604
Would you like me to return you
to your former lives?

831
01:04:14.730 --> 01:04:16.064
Former lives?

832
01:04:16.106 --> 01:04:18.901
Why, yes. You see, you two...

833
01:04:18.942 --> 01:04:21.278
Well, you were already...

834
01:04:22.321 --> 01:04:24.031
Oh, never mind.

835
01:04:24.114 --> 01:04:27.409
Well? Does anyone want
to marry my son?

836
01:04:30.829 --> 01:04:32.497
I do.

837
01:04:34.082 --> 01:04:37.127
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

838
01:05:11.578 --> 01:05:15.249
And they lived happily ever after,

839
01:05:15.290 --> 01:05:16.792
again.

840
01:05:31.598 --> 01:05:35.811
Somehow I know I will find a way

841
01:05:35.853 --> 01:05:38.355
To a brighter day

842
01:05:38.438 --> 01:05:41.525
In the sun

843
01:05:41.608 --> 01:05:45.779
Somewhere I know that he waits for me

844
01:05:45.863 --> 01:05:48.615
Someday soon he'll see

845
01:05:48.699 --> 01:05:51.952
I'm the one

846
01:05:52.035 --> 01:05:56.665
I won't give up on this feeling

847
01:05:56.707 --> 01:06:01.378
And nothing could keep me away

848
01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:06.925
'Cause I still believe in destiny

849
01:06:07.009 --> 01:06:11.388
That you and I were meant to be

850
01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:18.020
I still wish on the stars
as they fall from above

851
01:06:18.061 --> 01:06:21.231
'Cause I still believe

852
01:06:21.273 --> 01:06:24.318
Believe in love

853
01:06:32.910 --> 01:06:37.080
I know what's real cannot be denied

854
01:06:37.122 --> 01:06:39.708
Although it may hide

855
01:06:39.791 --> 01:06:43.086
For a while

856
01:06:43.128 --> 01:06:47.257
With just one touch
love can conquer fears

857
01:06:47.341 --> 01:06:49.927
Turning all your tears

858
01:06:50.010 --> 01:06:53.096
Into smiles

859
01:06:53.138 --> 01:06:57.935
It's such a wondrous feeling

860
01:06:57.976 --> 01:07:02.523
I know that my heart can't be wrong

861
01:07:02.606 --> 01:07:08.237
'Cause I still believe in destiny

862
01:07:08.278 --> 01:07:12.866
That you and I were meant to be

863
01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:18.872
I still wish on the stars
as they fall from above

864
01:07:18.914 --> 01:07:22.209
'Cause I still believe

01:07:22.292 --> 01:07:25.546
Believe in love

866
01:07:40.853 --> 01:07:43.272
Love can make miracles

867
01:07:43.313 --> 01:07:45.649
Change everything

868
01:07:45.691 --> 01:07:47.860
Lift you from the darkness

869
01:07:47.943 --> 01:07:51.029
And make your heart sing

870
01:07:51.113 --> 01:07:53.657
Love is forever

871
01:07:53.699 --> 01:07:55.492
When you fall

872
01:07:55.576 --> 01:07:57.828
It's the greatest power

873
01:07:57.870 --> 01:08:00.998
Of all

874
01:08:14.428 --> 01:08:19.765
'Cause I still believe in destiny

875
01:08:19.850 --> 01:08:24.479

Yes, I still believe

01:08:40.328 --> 01:08:45.000
Believe in love

881
01:08:48.504 --> 01:08:51.548
I still believe in love

882
01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:00.724
I still believe

01:09:00.765 --> 01:09:05.895
Believe in love
