3
00:00:30,496 --> 00:00:33,568
This is Mr. Cobb
and my lover, Kynan Dutton,

4
00:00:33,599 --> 00:00:36,603
patrolling with
sexy-ass guns, yes it is.

5
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,324
911, what's your emergency?

6
00:00:50,349 --> 00:00:52,488
Um, I'm the mayor of Leith,
down there.

7
00:00:52,518 --> 00:00:55,260
- Yes.
-And there's been issues

8
00:00:55,287 --> 00:00:57,631
starting yesterday morning.

9
00:00:57,857 --> 00:01:00,895
A couple people
wandering up to my property.

10
00:01:02,928 --> 00:01:05,272
Cobb and Kynan Dutton
both have rifles,

11
00:01:05,297 --> 00:01:07,106
and my husband was out there
and they're yelling at him

12
00:01:07,132 --> 00:01:08,634
-and yelling at him.
-Okay, okay.

13
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:09,938
Hurry!

14
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:11,971
Does he have a weapon? Ma'am?

15
00:01:12,004 --> 00:01:13,608
My husband doesn't,
but the Cobb does.

16
00:01:13,639 --> 00:01:15,050
Okay?'-

17
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:18,945
They followed me home
from the Cooks'

18
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:20,457
and were just yelling
and cursing,

19
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,255
and calling me
all kinds of names.

20
00:01:23,282 --> 00:01:24,488
Help!

21
00:01:24,516 --> 00:01:26,621
- Where are you?
-We're in Leith.

22
00:01:26,652 --> 00:01:29,064
- You're in Leith?
-Yes, right away.

23
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,465
Okay?'-

24
00:02:05,257 --> 00:02:06,395
Watch out!

25
00:02:07,426 --> 00:02:09,428
Hey, hey, hey!

26
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:15,108
I became mayor
three years ago.

27
00:02:17,436 --> 00:02:19,677
The two previous
mayors passed away,

28
00:02:19,705 --> 00:02:23,084
so I was next in line
to take the job.

29
00:02:23,108 --> 00:02:24,451
Before then,
I sat on the council

30
00:02:24,476 --> 00:02:26,285
since I was 16 years old.

31
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,349
So, I got grandfathered
into the position.

32
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,020
Um, Leith is, uh,
three square miles,

33
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,657
and 24 residents,
with the children.

34
00:02:40,292 --> 00:02:43,205
The city, it kind of
died off in the mid-1900s,

35
00:02:43,228 --> 00:02:46,471
and there's only one
business left here.

36
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,478
We're very welcoming of
people because, uh, you know,

37
00:02:55,507 --> 00:02:57,214
<i>if somebody says,
"We wanna move there,"</i>

38
00:02:57,242 --> 00:02:59,415
we were grateful for it
because we had new neighbors

39
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:02,449
and, uh, just more
people around.

40
00:03:12,558 --> 00:03:17,200
I was born and raised
in Longview, Washington.

41
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:18,731
And I lived in Oregon
all my life

42
00:03:18,764 --> 00:03:20,471
until we got married.

43
00:03:20,499 --> 00:03:23,036
Yeah, we've been married
almost 14 years.

44
00:03:23,068 --> 00:03:25,275
We met in church.

45
00:03:25,304 --> 00:03:27,181
Ya know, when we moved in,
we used to joke

46
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:28,742
that we increased
the population of Leith

47
00:03:28,774 --> 00:03:32,517
by what, 25 or 50 percent,
or something,

48
00:03:32,544 --> 00:03:36,117
with our kids and everything,
so it was kind of a joke.

49
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:45,301
I met my wife in
Norfolk, Nebraska.

50
00:03:45,324 --> 00:03:47,531
She always teases me
about coming up here to live

51
00:03:47,559 --> 00:03:50,403
and I was like,
"No, it's not gonna happen,"

52
00:03:50,429 --> 00:03:52,568
you know, but, uh,

53
00:03:52,598 --> 00:03:55,204
I pretty much
got comfortable up here.

54
00:03:57,469 --> 00:03:58,812
Day-to-day life
here for me

55
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:02,144
is generally drive bus
in the morning.

56
00:04:04,176 --> 00:04:05,746
Hey!

57
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:10,056
The kids help me out
on the farm.

58
00:04:10,082 --> 00:04:11,527
And so does my wife.

59
00:04:14,286 --> 00:04:17,199
We live out here because
we like the privacy,

60
00:04:17,222 --> 00:04:19,793
and the secluded feel,
and just the beauty

61
00:04:19,825 --> 00:04:22,135
of the country around us,
it's just--

62
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:23,663
this is why we're here.

63
00:04:26,465 --> 00:04:28,411
It's very rural America.

64
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,607
Everybody has
each other's backs.

65
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,225
I did what I would do
to anybody that had

66
00:04:46,251 --> 00:04:48,231
just moved into Leith,
or as I was meeting them

67
00:04:48,253 --> 00:04:49,288
for the first time,
I would say,

68
00:04:49,321 --> 00:04:51,164
"Well, welcome to Leith."

69
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,397
I didn't want to, you know,
be buddy-buddy with him

70
00:04:53,425 --> 00:04:55,336
because he did come across
as a little strange,

71
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,601
but I thought this was
just a lonely man,

72
00:04:57,629 --> 00:05:00,439
you know, that needs
somebody to care about him.

73
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,503
That was my first thought
and I hate to admit this,

74
00:05:02,534 --> 00:05:05,538
but, my second thought was
my mom was single.

75
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:07,482
I said, "Mom, there's
this guy in Leith,

76
00:05:07,506 --> 00:05:09,577
he's lonely, maybe you
guys could hook up."

77
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,720
Cobb's arrival
happened a year ago

78
00:05:13,745 --> 00:05:17,386
and at first, I just
thought he was a quiet,

79
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:21,887
keep-to-himself type of guy,
and, he told me at that time

80
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:23,327
he was working
in the oil field.

81
00:05:26,825 --> 00:05:31,365
The oil boom has
affected us quite heavily.

82
00:05:33,632 --> 00:05:35,441
We have a bunch of
businesses that support

83
00:05:35,467 --> 00:05:37,276
the oil industry,
so they hire on

84
00:05:37,302 --> 00:05:38,645
a lot of people.

85
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:42,544
Some are just transients
through looking for work,

86
00:05:42,574 --> 00:05:45,418
some of them stay
for some jobs.

87
00:05:45,444 --> 00:05:47,151
There's a lot of good people
that have come here,

88
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:49,159
but there's a lot of people
that have come here

89
00:05:49,181 --> 00:05:50,660
just because they couldn't

90
00:05:50,682 --> 00:05:52,286
find a job elsewhere.

91
00:05:52,317 --> 00:05:53,887
You don't always know
who you're dealing with.

92
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,365
You don't know
their history all the time.

93
00:05:56,388 --> 00:05:57,628
You bought this land
right here?

94
00:05:57,656 --> 00:05:59,226
- Yes.
-Okay, and what did you buy

95
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:00,703
this land here for,
this empty land?

96
00:06:00,726 --> 00:06:03,172
Uh, let me see,
these lots were $500 each,

97
00:06:03,195 --> 00:06:04,572
-and I'm told...
-$500?

98
00:06:04,596 --> 00:06:08,373
Yeah, but now they're
worth about $3300.

99
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,811
I've seen him
once on the street

100
00:06:09,835 --> 00:06:11,610
when he first got here.

101
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:13,344
And he turned around
asked me did we have

102
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:15,249
any land for sale.

103
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:18,744
He had on a long coat
and kind of looked over

104
00:06:18,777 --> 00:06:20,415
his shoulder to ask me
the question,

105
00:06:20,445 --> 00:06:22,220
and I thought it
was kind of weird

106
00:06:22,247 --> 00:06:23,783
'cause the coat
was kind of warm

107
00:06:23,815 --> 00:06:25,488
for the time of the day
and time of the year,

108
00:06:25,517 --> 00:06:27,360
you know, and I was like,

109
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:29,229
no we didn't have
any land for sale.

110
00:06:29,254 --> 00:06:32,667
And he kept walkin'.

111
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:37,333
At the time, I had no idea
what his ultimate plan was.

112
00:07:13,265 --> 00:07:15,768
My name is Ryan Lenz,
I'm senior writer

113
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:16,939
for the Southern Poverty
Law Center's

114
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:18,915
intelligence project.

115
00:07:18,937 --> 00:07:22,544
We monitor and report
on domestic extremism,

116
00:07:22,574 --> 00:07:25,453
uh, hate groups.

117
00:07:25,477 --> 00:07:27,684
The Southern Poverty Law
Center's intelligence report

118
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:31,286
documents an alarming rise
in the number of hate groups

119
00:07:31,316 --> 00:07:33,728
in the United States.

120
00:07:33,752 --> 00:07:35,629
A crime rooted in hate.

121
00:07:35,654 --> 00:07:37,327
Eighty-eight year old
James von Brunn

122
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:39,700
entered the Holocaust Museum
opening deadly fire

123
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:41,295
at Stephen Johns.

124
00:07:41,326 --> 00:07:43,772
An attempted bombing
in Spokane, Washington.

125
00:07:43,795 --> 00:07:45,741
The admitted white
supremacist built the bomb

126
00:07:45,764 --> 00:07:48,404
to protest multiculturalism.

127
00:07:48,433 --> 00:07:50,344
Ambulance up, subject found!

128
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:52,872
The alleged gunman,
Wade Michael Page.

129
00:07:52,904 --> 00:07:55,544
Army veteran and linked
to America's neo-Nazi

130
00:07:55,574 --> 00:07:58,578
white power world.

131
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,886
We cover white supremacists,
we think white supremacy

132
00:08:00,912 --> 00:08:02,687
is something
that shouldn't exist.

133
00:08:02,714 --> 00:08:04,660
We don't want hate groups
to exist in this country.

134
00:08:04,683 --> 00:08:06,856
We're gonna do whatever
we can legally,

135
00:08:06,885 --> 00:08:11,356
using public information,
to destroy these groups.

136
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,461
Ya know, if you wanna be
a Nazi, you can be a Nazi,

137
00:08:13,492 --> 00:08:14,994
but, like, I'm gonna make
sure the world knows

138
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:17,507
you're a Nazi.

139
00:08:19,931 --> 00:08:22,502
We've been right about Cobb.

140
00:08:22,534 --> 00:08:24,673
Definitely more than a decade.

141
00:08:24,703 --> 00:08:26,683
I mean, this is a guy
who was on the lam

142
00:08:26,705 --> 00:08:28,480
from a hate crime
charge in Canada,

143
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:29,986
this guy got kicked
out of Estonia

144
00:08:30,008 --> 00:08:31,783
for illegal activities,
I mean, this is one of,

145
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,689
you know, top ten
white supremacists

146
00:08:34,713 --> 00:08:36,784
in the United States.

147
00:08:36,815 --> 00:08:40,820
How are people with beliefs
like yours using the media?

148
00:08:40,852 --> 00:08:41,922
How are we using the media?

149
00:08:41,953 --> 00:08:43,728
I guess like you are, Joel.

150
00:08:43,755 --> 00:08:45,530
We're trying to set
our own myths,

151
00:08:45,557 --> 00:08:47,468
instead of adopting
Jewish myth.

152
00:08:47,492 --> 00:08:48,903
Get the fuck out
of our lives, kike,

153
00:08:48,927 --> 00:08:51,931
let's legalize kiking.

154
00:08:51,963 --> 00:08:53,499
We want our own
media company

155
00:08:53,532 --> 00:08:55,910
and we have
the right to do it.

156
00:08:55,934 --> 00:08:58,710
Let's go out
and throw somethin'.

157
00:08:58,737 --> 00:09:00,808
Yeah, there aren't any
niggers in this area.

158
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:02,477
You're not supposed
to throw at niggers,

159
00:09:02,507 --> 00:09:04,009
it might be
racial intimidation.

160
00:09:04,042 --> 00:09:05,715
They're very sensitive.

161
00:09:05,744 --> 00:09:07,883
Are any of you Negroes
armed right now?

162
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:11,085
Why don't you ask
the fucking white people

163
00:09:11,116 --> 00:09:13,027
if they're armed?

164
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:17,124
That nigger popped my camera,
why didn't you go arrest him?

165
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:19,836
Craig Cobb has been involved
in the Creativity Movement

166
00:09:19,858 --> 00:09:21,030
for years
and years and years.

167
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:23,005
They call themselves
"Creators."

168
00:09:23,028 --> 00:09:24,974
So, when you say
you're a Creator,

169
00:09:24,996 --> 00:09:26,839
I mean, you're not saying
you're a creation of God,

170
00:09:26,865 --> 00:09:28,105
like there's
some God out there

171
00:09:28,133 --> 00:09:29,771
that made you what you are.

172
00:09:29,801 --> 00:09:33,510
No, you are God,
all-Aryan man is God,

173
00:09:33,538 --> 00:09:36,712
and these people produce
a lot of violence.

174
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,619
White supremacist
Matthew Hale was arrested

175
00:09:38,643 --> 00:09:41,385
for soliciting the murder
of a federal judge.

176
00:09:41,413 --> 00:09:43,586
She had ruled he could
no longer call his hate group

177
00:09:43,615 --> 00:09:46,494
"The World Church
of the Creator."

178
00:09:46,518 --> 00:09:50,557
Craig Cobb posted
Judge Lefkow's home address.

179
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:52,591
Cobb is a bit of a maniac

180
00:09:52,624 --> 00:09:55,571
about posting personal
information in retaliation

181
00:09:55,594 --> 00:09:57,972
for, um, things
that he doesn't like

182
00:09:57,996 --> 00:10:00,670
that are being said about him
or about his allies.

183
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:03,145
Lefkow's husband
and her 89-year-old mother

184
00:10:03,168 --> 00:10:05,671
were both shot in the head.

185
00:10:05,704 --> 00:10:09,652
Ultimately, Lefkow's family
was not killed by somebody

186
00:10:09,674 --> 00:10:11,176
in the white supremacist
movement.

187
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,185
All we know is that Cobb
put the stuff out there,

188
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:15,756
whether or not it led
to that person finding

189
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,728
that information out,
unknown.

190
00:10:26,825 --> 00:10:28,429
And so Cobb had
posted something

191
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,441
on Vanguard News Network,
that white nationalist,

192
00:10:31,463 --> 00:10:33,170
racist forum.

193
00:10:33,198 --> 00:10:34,734
He had posted something,

194
00:10:34,766 --> 00:10:35,938
sent out an open
advertisement, you know,

195
00:10:35,967 --> 00:10:37,571
saying that he had
gone to Leith

196
00:10:37,602 --> 00:10:38,842
and he encouraged
all white nationalists

197
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:39,780
to move there,
told everybody

198
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,682
what he was doing.

199
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,220
So, I flew to North Dakota,
to Grant County.

200
00:11:01,226 --> 00:11:03,797
It's so weird when
you drive into that town.

201
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,173
You take that curved road
and all of a sudden

202
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:08,109
<i>there's that plank
that says,</i>

203
00:11:08,133 --> 00:11:11,774
"Welcome to Leith."

204
00:11:11,803 --> 00:11:13,714
There was no infrastructure.

205
00:11:13,738 --> 00:11:17,515
Everything else just seems
to have been forgotten.

206
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:20,079
A B-roll to
"The Walking Dead."

207
00:11:22,747 --> 00:11:25,489
And so I went
to the county offices and said,

208
00:11:25,517 --> 00:11:28,794
"Hey, has Craig Cobb
sold or bought properties

209
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,800
in the last ten months?"

210
00:11:30,822 --> 00:11:32,563
And she starts saying,
"Yeah, yeah, yeah,

211
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:34,264
he's actually been buying
quite a lot," you know.

212
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:36,063
I said, "Well, who's he been,
like--has he been selling?"

213
00:11:36,094 --> 00:11:38,700
"Oh yeah, he sold some, too,"
and I said, "To whom?"

214
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,175
And she star-ts naming
these people, like, you know,

215
00:11:40,198 --> 00:11:43,736
names that are, you know,
as much as they can be

216
00:11:43,768 --> 00:11:45,509
luminaries on
the racist right,

217
00:11:45,537 --> 00:11:48,017
you know, like,
people like Tom Metzger.

218
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:50,576
White Aryan Resistance
war out of Indiana.

219
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:51,815
Nigger, nigger, nigger!

220
00:11:51,843 --> 00:11:53,754
Out, out, out!

221
00:11:53,778 --> 00:11:54,882
Nigger, nigger, nigger!

222
00:11:54,913 --> 00:11:56,654
Out, out, out!

223
00:11:56,681 --> 00:11:58,092
Metzger's scary.

224
00:11:58,116 --> 00:11:59,561
White revolution!

225
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,289
White revolution!

226
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:04,728
We sued that group
back in the early '90s

227
00:12:04,756 --> 00:12:06,758
because people were
influenced by Metzger

228
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,533
to stomp to death
an Ethiopian immigrant.

229
00:12:09,561 --> 00:12:11,302
You know, if you're living
in this little town,

230
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:12,907
the guy's across the street
and he's friends with the guy

231
00:12:12,931 --> 00:12:14,672
who influenced someone
to kill someone,

232
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:16,610
yeah, it's a little scary.

233
00:12:18,236 --> 00:12:21,080
He had sold Alex Linder,
who runs VNN.

234
00:12:21,106 --> 00:12:23,643
The most extreme elements
of the movement

235
00:12:23,675 --> 00:12:25,916
are really on
Vanguard News Network,

236
00:12:25,944 --> 00:12:28,788
which is, uh, openly
exterminationist,

237
00:12:28,813 --> 00:12:30,986
in other words,
its policy is that Jews

238
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:32,324
should be genocided.

239
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:33,996
What we should do
is exterminate them.

240
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,329
Their behavior over
2,000 years has shown

241
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:37,795
that when you kick them out,

242
00:12:37,822 --> 00:12:39,927
they always end up
being let back in.

243
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,564
They cause the same problems.

244
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:46,666
So, you know, Cobb
obviously had a vision

245
00:12:46,698 --> 00:12:49,577
of bringing not just
white supremacists to Leith,

246
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:51,205
but bringing the leadership

247
00:12:51,236 --> 00:12:54,115
of the white supremacist
movement to Leith.

248
00:12:57,876 --> 00:12:59,321
I was like, this is real,
like, this is

249
00:12:59,344 --> 00:13:02,757
the smallest town
I've ever seen in my life

250
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:04,988
and I can't believe racists

251
00:13:05,016 --> 00:13:08,691
are buying up
properties here.

252
00:13:10,755 --> 00:13:12,063
Then I star-ted thinking,
you know, "What a perfect

253
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,626
place to do it."

254
00:13:13,658 --> 00:13:14,864
You go to someplace
like Leith, you know,

255
00:13:14,893 --> 00:13:16,065
where people aren't looking,

256
00:13:16,094 --> 00:13:18,802
where people
keep to themselves.

257
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:22,004
So, I went and talked
to Ryan Schock.

258
00:13:22,033 --> 00:13:24,809
I was shocked, and being
as I live out here

259
00:13:24,836 --> 00:13:28,215
and I've--haven't been much
place in this world,

260
00:13:28,239 --> 00:13:29,912
I honestly didn't even know

261
00:13:29,941 --> 00:13:31,818
what a white supremacist
was at the time.

262
00:13:31,843 --> 00:13:34,881
I assured him it
wasn't anybody good

263
00:13:34,913 --> 00:13:37,359
and I was worried
at that point, um,

264
00:13:37,382 --> 00:13:40,158
I just felt
something changing.

265
00:13:40,185 --> 00:13:42,131
It was this moment
where the outside world

266
00:13:42,153 --> 00:13:45,066
that has kept apart from
much of rural America

267
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,229
comes in and just
son of, like,

268
00:13:47,258 --> 00:13:50,671
rears its ugly fucking head
and you have to address it.

269
00:13:50,695 --> 00:13:52,902
Something you didn't
even know existed

270
00:13:52,931 --> 00:13:54,171
all of a sudden
just kind of like

271
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:56,736
came up through the soil.

272
00:13:56,768 --> 00:13:59,044
Well-known white supremacist
Craig Cobb

273
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:03,815
plans to turn Leith into
a white nationalist community.

274
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:05,947
It would be extraordinarily
beautiful when people

275
00:14:05,977 --> 00:14:09,186
enter the town because
we will have floodlit flags

276
00:14:09,214 --> 00:14:12,388
of all the formerly
white nations of Europe.

277
00:14:12,417 --> 00:14:14,192
Cobb says like-minded people

278
00:14:14,219 --> 00:14:16,256
with white nationalist
organizations

279
00:14:16,287 --> 00:14:18,699
will be taking up residence
on his properties,

280
00:14:18,723 --> 00:14:19,963
so they'll have
the majority of votes

281
00:14:19,991 --> 00:14:21,698
to take over the town.

282
00:14:21,726 --> 00:14:24,036
What we're trying
to do is move people

283
00:14:24,062 --> 00:14:25,905
into an area where
they can get jobs

284
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:29,104
at $50,000 a year
almost immediately.

285
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:31,307
<i>Cobb has a plan
that as crazy as it sounds,</i>

286
00:14:31,336 --> 00:14:33,077
might actually happen.

287
00:14:33,104 --> 00:14:34,811
He purchased one parcel
and another parcel,

288
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:38,286
and he finally got up to
12 to 13 parcels of land.

289
00:14:38,309 --> 00:14:40,812
He had the whole town
mapped out as to what

290
00:14:40,845 --> 00:14:44,691
he was gonna build on each
piece of land that he owns.

291
00:14:44,716 --> 00:14:47,788
And after I see the map,
it's very scary.

292
00:14:47,819 --> 00:14:50,231
Here we can gather together
and become a simple majority

293
00:14:50,255 --> 00:14:53,702
by legal electoral rights
within the United States,

294
00:14:53,725 --> 00:14:55,932
and have many young women
who are the mates

295
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,806
of young males in monogamous
relationships pregnant

296
00:14:59,831 --> 00:15:02,243
because pregnancy
is a sign of confidence.

297
00:15:02,267 --> 00:15:03,974
Where does all that hate
come from?

298
00:15:04,002 --> 00:15:07,108
Uh, you know, we hate
that which threatens

299
00:15:07,138 --> 00:15:10,176
that which we love, Gary.

300
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:13,246
And, we're being genocided
in our own country,

301
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:14,757
wouldn't you?

302
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:17,123
Wouldn't you be
bitter about it?

303
00:15:17,148 --> 00:15:19,822
The irony of the story,
Bobby Harper,

304
00:15:19,851 --> 00:15:21,728
the only black
in Grant County,

305
00:15:21,753 --> 00:15:24,962
and his wife Cheryl
live directly behind Cobb.

306
00:15:24,989 --> 00:15:26,832
Would you stay in the town
if his supporters came in

307
00:15:26,858 --> 00:15:28,895
and star-ted
controlling the town?

308
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:30,338
Yes, I still would be here.

309
00:15:30,361 --> 00:15:32,500
- How come?
-Because it's my home

310
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:34,768
and I have a right
to be there.

311
00:15:37,402 --> 00:15:39,279
I mean, it was like
a stick of dynamite

312
00:15:39,304 --> 00:15:43,411
that just blew up, I mean,
people were just freaked out.

313
00:15:54,152 --> 00:15:57,429
I donated a building to NSM.

314
00:15:57,455 --> 00:15:59,457
I support a lot
of what they do.

315
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:01,061
The National Socialist
Movement is one

316
00:16:01,092 --> 00:16:04,266
of the largest neo-Nazi
groups in the country.

317
00:16:04,295 --> 00:16:07,105
<i>Just as our Founding Fathers
shot the warning shots</i>

318
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,406
of the Revolution,

319
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:10,276
a new revolution
is brewing here.

320
00:16:10,301 --> 00:16:12,178
The NSM lists
its headquarters

321
00:16:12,203 --> 00:16:14,843
right here in Detroit.

322
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,490
Originally,
Craig had contacted us

323
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:26,257
about what he was doing
in Leith

324
00:16:26,284 --> 00:16:28,525
and had deeded us a property.

325
00:16:28,553 --> 00:16:30,965
So, my thinking was,
I'll go out to Leith.

326
00:16:36,995 --> 00:16:38,531
We got it for a steal.

327
00:16:43,401 --> 00:16:45,472
And, you know,
when the media got involved

328
00:16:45,503 --> 00:16:48,450
and SPLC tried to make
a big deal out of it

329
00:16:48,473 --> 00:16:50,180
like he should be stopped,

330
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,154
to me, I took it as a threat.

331
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,451
Here's this guy
that they feel

332
00:16:53,478 --> 00:16:55,458
that they can victimize.

333
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,051
Nobody victimizes the
National Socialist Movement.

334
00:16:58,082 --> 00:16:59,891
That's asking for trouble,
that's like backing a dog

335
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,829
into a corner with a stick.

336
00:17:01,853 --> 00:17:03,196
You keep poking that dog
into the corner with a stick,

337
00:17:03,221 --> 00:17:04,825
you're gonna get bit.

338
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,371
I do understand
white nationalism

339
00:17:11,396 --> 00:17:15,003
is radically defamed
as being antithetical

340
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:16,603
to human evolution
and so forth,

341
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:20,009
things like that that are
really overly dramatic.

342
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:22,177
But if the First Amendment
is taken away from people

343
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,208
in this country,
we have the right

344
00:17:23,241 --> 00:17:25,221
to go to war.

345
00:17:27,245 --> 00:17:29,020
We have new developments
tonight in connection

346
00:17:29,047 --> 00:17:30,321
with a planned visit
by a group

347
00:17:30,348 --> 00:17:32,157
of white supremacists.

348
00:17:32,183 --> 00:17:35,528
Schoep is now asking
to have a town hall meeting.

349
00:17:38,256 --> 00:17:39,860
Former members
of the activist group

350
00:17:39,891 --> 00:17:42,997
Anti-Racist Action
have ties to North Dakota

351
00:17:43,027 --> 00:17:45,439
and are planning to rally
around the town of Leith

352
00:17:45,463 --> 00:17:48,342
and force Cobb out.

353
00:17:48,366 --> 00:17:52,212
There's lives at stake,
and when the integrity

354
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,342
of your community
is at stake,

355
00:17:54,372 --> 00:17:56,545
it's time to stand up.

356
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:04,892
We got your back!

357
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:05,553
Alright!

358
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:08,063
No Nazis, no KKK!

359
00:18:10,154 --> 00:18:14,296
No Nazis, no KKK,
no Fascist U.S.A.!

360
00:18:14,325 --> 00:18:16,100
Our lives should not
have to change

361
00:18:16,127 --> 00:18:17,970
because of one guy's agenda.

362
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:21,500
No Nazis, no KKK,
no Fascist U.S.A.!

363
00:18:21,532 --> 00:18:23,443
You know, it's really funny
because millions of whites

364
00:18:23,468 --> 00:18:25,948
have been driven out
of their neighborhoods

365
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:27,677
and cities by violence.

366
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:29,943
And here,
we just have democracy

367
00:18:29,974 --> 00:18:33,114
and they want
to drive us out.

368
00:18:33,144 --> 00:18:34,953
A strong showing
of support for Leith

369
00:18:34,979 --> 00:18:37,653
coming from North Dakota's
Native Americans,

370
00:18:37,682 --> 00:18:40,925
who came here angry and ready
to take on Craig Cobb

371
00:18:40,952 --> 00:18:43,432
and members of the
National Socialist Movement.

372
00:18:43,454 --> 00:18:46,992
You represent a dying cause!

373
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:48,561
- Yeah!
-Woo!

374
00:18:50,461 --> 00:18:53,169
So, North Dakota, we got
one thing to say, this:

375
00:18:53,197 --> 00:18:54,938
Go home!

376
00:18:54,966 --> 00:18:57,469
Go home! Go home!

377
00:18:57,502 --> 00:19:00,346
Go home! Go home!

378
00:19:00,371 --> 00:19:01,645
Go home!

379
00:19:31,035 --> 00:19:33,140
Okay, thank you
all for coming.

380
00:19:33,171 --> 00:19:35,583
We're gonna get
about 20 voters here

381
00:19:35,606 --> 00:19:37,051
and we will be in charge

382
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:39,248
of the city
government of Leith.

383
00:19:39,277 --> 00:19:42,190
In the interim,
I wanted to thank

384
00:19:42,213 --> 00:19:43,692
Commander Jeff Schoep

385
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:45,695
of the National
Socialist Movement.

386
00:19:47,652 --> 00:19:49,393
This is how
we're gonna star-t out.

387
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,161
If you're making
noise in here,

388
00:19:51,189 --> 00:19:52,463
and you're hollering,
and you're booing,

389
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:54,197
and you're being
disrespectful,

390
00:19:54,225 --> 00:19:56,398
we will remove you or
the police will remove you.

391
00:19:56,427 --> 00:19:58,304
Yeah, I'll whoop
your fucking ass.

392
00:19:58,329 --> 00:19:59,672
Bring it!

393
00:19:59,697 --> 00:20:01,540
Yo, I'll whoop the fuck
right outta you.

394
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,583
I've read different things
and heard different things

395
00:20:10,608 --> 00:20:13,282
in the media, people saying,
"Well, we'll try to kick him

396
00:20:13,311 --> 00:20:16,155
out of town, we'll try
to drag him out of town."

397
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:20,560
That is a violation
of Mr. Cobb's civil rights

398
00:20:20,585 --> 00:20:22,155
as an American.

399
00:20:22,186 --> 00:20:23,790
The National Socialist
Movement is here today

400
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:26,559
to defend Craig Cobb
and his right to live here

401
00:20:26,591 --> 00:20:30,471
in this nation, in this city,
in this town, in this county,

402
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:34,637
and that right will not be
abridged, period.

403
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:01,127
We're watching you
all the time!

404
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:02,467
Everywhere you go,
all the time,

405
00:21:02,493 --> 00:21:03,403
we'll be watching.

406
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,812
We're gonna be watching
you all the time, buddy!

407
00:21:11,836 --> 00:21:15,249
Every second of every day!

408
00:21:15,273 --> 00:21:18,277
Every second,
you're gonna be watched.

409
00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:21,552
There are gonna be cameras
on you all night long.

410
00:21:21,579 --> 00:21:24,355
We're gonna be watching
you all the time, buddy!

411
00:21:24,382 --> 00:21:26,658
Every second of every day!

412
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:37,862
Craig Cobb is no longer
the only white supremacist

413
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:39,700
living in Leith,
North Dakota.

414
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:42,108
Kynan and Deborah Dutton
and their five young children

415
00:21:42,133 --> 00:21:44,511
recently moved
to Leith from Oregon.

416
00:21:44,535 --> 00:21:46,242
Twenty-eight year old
Kynan Dutton

417
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:49,251
is an Iraq War veteran
and self-proclaimed skinhead.

418
00:21:49,273 --> 00:21:51,446
The family lives in a trailer
on Cobb's property

419
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,750
and must use an outhouse

420
00:21:52,777 --> 00:21:54,484
because there's
no running water.

421
00:21:54,512 --> 00:21:56,514
The Duttons say they know
at least three more

422
00:21:56,547 --> 00:22:00,495
white supremacists planning
to move to Leith.

423
00:22:00,518 --> 00:22:03,829
There you go, this is
a good Reich one.

424
00:22:17,668 --> 00:22:22,549
We have a lot of countries
here, historic and current,

425
00:22:22,573 --> 00:22:23,847
some of which were
dissolved after the end

426
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:25,445
of the Third Reich.

427
00:22:25,476 --> 00:22:28,150
Germany, Sweden, Norway,

428
00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:31,524
the countries of Aryan
origins, for the most pan.

429
00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:33,688
This one here is the NSM,
that's the organization

430
00:22:33,718 --> 00:22:35,720
that I belong to,

431
00:22:35,753 --> 00:22:37,528
which is the National
Socialist Movement,

432
00:22:37,555 --> 00:22:41,332
and this is
the Britannia flag.

433
00:22:45,229 --> 00:22:46,640
The National
Socialist Movement

434
00:22:46,664 --> 00:22:47,836
heard about Craig
and heard about what

435
00:22:47,865 --> 00:22:50,812
he was trying to do here.

436
00:22:50,835 --> 00:22:53,816
All we want in the world
is our own separatism,

437
00:22:53,838 --> 00:22:56,682
and our ability to live
within our own people

438
00:22:56,707 --> 00:22:58,414
to reinforce our own culture.

439
00:22:58,442 --> 00:23:01,685
We feel like in public
and in modern society,

440
00:23:01,712 --> 00:23:03,919
there's too much
of the multiculturalism,

441
00:23:03,948 --> 00:23:07,361
and that it's taking away
from our people's solidarity.

442
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:09,331
I just found out recently
that white children

443
00:23:09,353 --> 00:23:10,764
under the age of five
are now a minority

444
00:23:10,788 --> 00:23:14,395
in America
for the first time.

445
00:23:14,425 --> 00:23:15,904
And so, it's something
that concerns us

446
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:20,569
as proud whites
and as proud Aryans.

447
00:23:20,598 --> 00:23:22,942
We're a white civil rights
activist group.

448
00:23:22,967 --> 00:23:24,776
The NAACP exists for blacks,

449
00:23:24,802 --> 00:23:27,305
there's Hispanic
organizations for them,

450
00:23:27,338 --> 00:23:30,410
there's the JDL
for the Jewish population.

451
00:23:30,441 --> 00:23:32,978
We are nothing
that isn't what they are.

452
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:37,557
Just for whites, for people
of European descent.

453
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,858
Our goal is to do what
we're doing and leave,

454
00:23:39,884 --> 00:23:41,795
and be successful to a degree
and then, of course,

455
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:44,595
hopefully the idea would
spread to other communities.

456
00:23:44,622 --> 00:23:46,397
If we could have peace
and if we could have

457
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:51,373
a white community,
then others could, too.

458
00:23:51,395 --> 00:23:53,500
So, we feel like
we're son of a stepping stone

459
00:23:53,531 --> 00:23:54,908
to a greater purpose.

460
00:23:54,932 --> 00:23:57,412
And there's more
people coming.

461
00:24:54,859 --> 00:24:59,308
The idea it's just Cobb
and Dutton is a huge mistake,

462
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:03,676
because there's a lot more
people involved in this stuff.

463
00:25:03,701 --> 00:25:05,647
These guys are just
the front-runners.

464
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,308
These guys are the guys
that are trying

465
00:25:07,338 --> 00:25:09,079
to plant the seeds.

466
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:11,719
You know, but there's
a lot of other people.

467
00:25:11,742 --> 00:25:14,484
All you have to do is
go to these websites

468
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:16,617
where these guys
are promoting this crap,

469
00:25:16,647 --> 00:25:19,321
and talking about this crap.

470
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:22,820
This is off of
a White Nations post.

471
00:25:22,853 --> 00:25:24,457
This is Craig Cobb himself.

472
00:25:24,488 --> 00:25:26,661
"Now I want again
to put out a call.

473
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:29,399
We see all political
racially aware whites,

474
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:31,703
longtime incarcerated whites,

475
00:25:31,729 --> 00:25:33,640
especially
from federal prisons

476
00:25:33,664 --> 00:25:36,645
as many as possible,
and fast, too.

477
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:39,511
Now is the time
to draw your sword."

478
00:25:48,379 --> 00:25:51,952
He's got pictures on there
of him standing with his gun,

479
00:25:51,982 --> 00:25:54,394
with a Christmas message.

480
00:25:54,418 --> 00:25:58,059
He's got my name,
phone number--

481
00:25:58,089 --> 00:25:59,534
Yeah, that's what this
is all right here.

482
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:01,127
Birthdate.

483
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:05,671
He posts my name, my address,
my ex-wife, all the places

484
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:07,573
- I've lived...
-Your brother, your sister...

485
00:26:07,598 --> 00:26:10,602
My brother, my sister.

486
00:26:10,634 --> 00:26:12,636
It's--it's bad.

487
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:15,446
It's really bad.

488
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:22,381
Back in Washington,

489
00:26:22,413 --> 00:26:25,519
we left some pretty
ugly stuff behind.

490
00:26:27,017 --> 00:26:31,625
My daughter was murdered
when she was 17 years old.

491
00:26:31,655 --> 00:26:33,828
Ya know, to even have
the mental capacity

492
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:36,634
to get up in the morning
was more than you could

493
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:40,164
cope with, you know,
lost everything.

494
00:26:42,099 --> 00:26:44,739
People really
take it for granted

495
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,807
that somebody like Cobb
is not gonna do something

496
00:26:47,838 --> 00:26:50,512
to their children,
and I wasn't willing

497
00:26:50,541 --> 00:26:52,919
to take that chance.

498
00:26:52,943 --> 00:26:55,924
This is what we sleep
with every night.

499
00:26:59,683 --> 00:27:01,560
This one's actually mine.

500
00:27:01,585 --> 00:27:03,724
This was my birthday present.

501
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:07,664
And we're going
to get our concealed

502
00:27:07,691 --> 00:27:10,934
weapons permits, too.

503
00:27:10,961 --> 00:27:13,965
'Cause we're gonna star-t
packing all the time.

504
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:19,938
I see Lee Cook's calling
into the program.

505
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:22,041
What are you guys
gonna do out there?

506
00:27:22,072 --> 00:27:25,519
I live across the street,
I know what's going on.

507
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:27,682
Did you call
the sheriff out there?

508
00:27:27,711 --> 00:27:29,987
The sheriff doesn't do
anything around here.

509
00:27:32,216 --> 00:27:34,992
We had a briefing here
in the commissioner's room

510
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:37,522
and we had North Dakota
Highway Patrol, we had the--

511
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:40,502
you have your own criminal
investigations for our state.

512
00:27:40,524 --> 00:27:41,969
We do a briefing
where you kind of go over

513
00:27:41,992 --> 00:27:43,494
what we're thinking
could happen,

514
00:27:43,527 --> 00:27:44,870
what, you know,
what we're gonna do

515
00:27:44,895 --> 00:27:45,965
if an emergency
situation occurs.

516
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:52,642
Grant County
is 1600 square miles.

517
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:55,150
We don't have the luxury
of having backup.

518
00:27:55,172 --> 00:27:56,879
Yeah, there's four deputies,
that's what we--

519
00:27:56,907 --> 00:27:59,080
well, three deputies
and a sheriff.

520
00:27:59,109 --> 00:28:01,055
We usually go
into something knowing

521
00:28:01,078 --> 00:28:04,616
that it's probably just us,
you're probably alone.

522
00:28:09,653 --> 00:28:11,496
The people of Leith
could not figure out

523
00:28:11,522 --> 00:28:12,796
why we couldn't just say,
you know,

524
00:28:12,823 --> 00:28:14,962
"Mr. Cobb, you need to leave
the area."

525
00:28:14,992 --> 00:28:17,529
It just doesn't work that way.

526
00:28:17,561 --> 00:28:20,735
How can he live day by day
hating people?

527
00:28:20,764 --> 00:28:22,505
Well, let me tell you something.

528
00:28:22,533 --> 00:28:24,843
Every time I think about
having sympathy for that guy,

529
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,507
I think to myself,

530
00:28:26,537 --> 00:28:31,213
"This guy deserves no mercy,
no sympathy."

531
00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:41,256
This is bullshit!

532
00:28:41,285 --> 00:28:42,923
We are in America.

533
00:28:42,953 --> 00:28:47,993
I am a disabled
American veteran!

534
00:28:48,025 --> 00:28:53,998
You guys will not treat me
like this.

535
00:28:54,031 --> 00:28:55,669
What have we done?

536
00:28:55,699 --> 00:28:58,111
Flipped me off,
treated my family like shit,

537
00:28:58,135 --> 00:29:01,742
ostracized my family
from these towns.

538
00:29:01,772 --> 00:29:05,242
You guys think
we're some fuckin' game.

539
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:07,187
- We are goin'--
-You know what?

540
00:29:07,211 --> 00:29:10,784
- We are goin'!
-You need some soap.

541
00:29:10,814 --> 00:29:12,623
Your mouth is filthy.

542
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:15,722
- We are going.
-You need to eat some soap.

543
00:29:15,753 --> 00:29:18,131
White power!

544
00:29:18,155 --> 00:29:20,601
Sieg heil!

545
00:29:20,624 --> 00:29:21,830
Listen,

546
00:29:21,859 --> 00:29:23,839
I'm only gonna say it once--

547
00:29:23,861 --> 00:29:27,707
They refuse service
in all these towns to us.

548
00:29:27,731 --> 00:29:29,642
Let's go outside.

549
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:31,112
Fuck you!

550
00:29:31,135 --> 00:29:34,742
And the rest
of this fuckin' town.

551
00:29:34,772 --> 00:29:36,843
Watch what you say to me.

552
00:29:36,874 --> 00:29:39,150
That's what he's been sayin'
to all of us.

553
00:29:39,176 --> 00:29:42,282
Let's go outside
and discuss this like we should.

554
00:29:58,862 --> 00:30:00,842
I don't have a problem
with orange, green,

555
00:30:00,864 --> 00:30:02,207
black, white, or brown people.

556
00:30:02,232 --> 00:30:03,734
They don't bother me that much.

557
00:30:03,767 --> 00:30:05,769
Stupid people do.

558
00:30:05,803 --> 00:30:07,783
These type of people--
the "Gnat-zis," I call 'em--

559
00:30:07,805 --> 00:30:10,012
white supremacists, separatists.

560
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,815
He's nothing
but an antagonistic,

561
00:30:11,842 --> 00:30:14,846
misogynistic, uh,

562
00:30:14,878 --> 00:30:16,619
let's see,
how shall I say this?

563
00:30:16,647 --> 00:30:18,354
Uh, he's an idiot!

564
00:30:20,651 --> 00:30:22,961
So, basically, what I did
was create a website--

565
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,694
LeithND.com--

566
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:27,828
and I had it up and running
within 12 hours.

567
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,630
The reason that I took on
this job

568
00:30:31,662 --> 00:30:34,973
is because I have the expertise,
the knowledge--

569
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,410
Whoops.

570
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:40,172
And I do this for documentation
for the city of Leith.

571
00:30:40,204 --> 00:30:41,945
Like I've told people before,

572
00:30:41,972 --> 00:30:44,782
if you don't like my camera,
that's too bad.

573
00:30:44,808 --> 00:30:47,948
I've not had a fire in my belly
for the last 25 years,

574
00:30:47,978 --> 00:30:50,185
and this has put a fire
in my belly.

575
00:30:58,722 --> 00:31:00,201
I'm right here--

576
00:31:00,224 --> 00:31:02,966
The meeting has not started yet,
so why are you in my face?

577
00:31:02,993 --> 00:31:04,700
This is a public place,
you're in a public area,

578
00:31:04,728 --> 00:31:06,230
that's why I have a right to.

579
00:31:06,263 --> 00:31:08,265
You can present your agenda
when the meeting starts.

580
00:31:08,298 --> 00:31:10,938
- Otherwise, leave me alone.
-Well, he says to get in there.

581
00:31:10,968 --> 00:31:13,209
Do what the man
tell you to, boy.

582
00:31:18,809 --> 00:31:22,222
What's your, uh, boy's name?

583
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,199
You'll be going
to North Dakota Prison.

584
00:31:31,221 --> 00:31:33,792
He's not my boy,
he's a man.

585
00:31:33,824 --> 00:31:36,134
You shove me, I will hit you.

586
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,969
I'm staying right here.

587
00:31:37,995 --> 00:31:41,306
Okay, you stay right there,
I'll stay right here, see?

588
00:31:41,331 --> 00:31:43,834
This accomplishes nothing.

589
00:31:51,775 --> 00:31:53,755
Okay, I'm gonna call
the meeting to order.

590
00:31:53,777 --> 00:31:57,020
I need motions and a second.

591
00:31:57,047 --> 00:31:59,152
Any discussion on events
from last week?

592
00:31:59,183 --> 00:32:00,753
I'd like to mention,
that meeting,

593
00:32:00,784 --> 00:32:03,094
<i>there was no public notice
so it was illegal.</i>

594
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,963
No public notice was given--

595
00:32:04,988 --> 00:32:06,467
Please, please be quiet.

596
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:08,128
Oh, well, it was
an illegal meeting--

597
00:32:08,158 --> 00:32:09,364
You'll have time to talk
at the end.

598
00:32:09,393 --> 00:32:10,895
Alright--there's no reason

599
00:32:10,928 --> 00:32:12,874
to cite something illegal,
though.

600
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,251
I'm gonna drive to Hazen.

601
00:32:58,275 --> 00:33:00,016
I work out of town,

602
00:33:00,043 --> 00:33:01,545
so I won't let 'em stay here
by themselves,

603
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:04,919
they have to come with me
and stay with me.

604
00:33:04,948 --> 00:33:07,861
- We gotta go.
-Yeah, we need to go.

605
00:33:24,301 --> 00:33:25,974
He's, you know,
he's got that Cook

606
00:33:26,003 --> 00:33:28,005
so rattled over there,
you know?

607
00:33:28,038 --> 00:33:30,814
And that Cook is the nicest
fucking guy on the planet.

608
00:33:30,841 --> 00:33:33,913
I mean, the guy wouldn't
hum a fly, you know?

609
00:33:33,944 --> 00:33:36,015
But he's got him so rattled
right now--

610
00:33:36,046 --> 00:33:39,027
And he's gonna push
that guy's button too far.

611
00:33:39,049 --> 00:33:41,188
Until he goes over
and kills him.

612
00:33:42,386 --> 00:33:43,956
- Yeah.
-Yeah.

613
00:33:43,987 --> 00:33:45,330
'Cause that guy
ain't just gonna go over

614
00:33:45,355 --> 00:33:46,595
and slap him alongside the head.

615
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:48,531
I mean, he's gonna--

616
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,869
He'll take him out.

617
00:33:50,894 --> 00:33:52,840
- Yeah.
-Yeah.

618
00:33:52,863 --> 00:33:55,070
I was on the phone with
the governor's office.

619
00:33:55,098 --> 00:33:59,240
<i>I says, "What would you do
if you were livin' beside him?"</i>

620
00:33:59,269 --> 00:34:00,873
You know?

621
00:34:00,904 --> 00:34:02,440
<i>And she says, "I know,
and I'm very sorry,"</i>

622
00:34:02,472 --> 00:34:04,577
and she's like,
"but you have to make damn sure

623
00:34:04,608 --> 00:34:06,849
you control your people."

624
00:34:09,012 --> 00:34:10,355
Keep 'em calm, and I'm like,

625
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,916
"I can't keep 'em calm
no longer.

626
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:13,223
I've done it for three months,"
I'm like,

627
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,161
"We can no longer
keep 'em calm."

628
00:34:15,185 --> 00:34:16,323
I don't blame you.

629
00:34:16,353 --> 00:34:17,593
You know,
the cocksucker's making

630
00:34:17,621 --> 00:34:19,157
these threats on everybody,

631
00:34:19,189 --> 00:34:21,294
so, that's where it gets scary.

632
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:23,168
You know.

633
00:34:23,193 --> 00:34:25,264
With him holding his shotgun,
saying,

634
00:34:25,295 --> 00:34:27,002
"Merry Christmas, Leith."

635
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:30,477
He doesn't own
one piece of property...

636
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:35,609
- That's not fucked up.
-That has water hooked up to it.

637
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,516
Nothing.

638
00:34:37,541 --> 00:34:39,578
None of 'em do.

639
00:34:43,413 --> 00:34:45,154
Yeah.

640
00:35:07,204 --> 00:35:08,979
Cobb does not
have running water,

641
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:10,679
or a sewer in his house and,

642
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:13,115
with the new ordinances
that we're gonna emplace now,

643
00:35:13,143 --> 00:35:17,319
they, uh, will require him
to have sewer running water.

644
00:35:17,347 --> 00:35:20,419
That's our plan as of right now.

645
00:35:32,562 --> 00:35:35,008
Yeah, I was just thinking
that one kind of creates

646
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:36,978
a little more of a barrier.

647
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,240
That's the only thing
I was thinking about,

648
00:35:38,268 --> 00:35:39,611
this bigger one.

649
00:35:39,636 --> 00:35:42,446
The more barriers, the better.

650
00:35:53,016 --> 00:35:55,189
Do we have to serve him
with a paper

651
00:35:55,218 --> 00:35:57,129
-starting the timeline?
-Right.

652
00:35:57,154 --> 00:35:58,497
Then he needs
to draw it up tomorrow--

653
00:35:58,522 --> 00:36:00,160
So we get it to him this week.

654
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,498
Yeah.

655
00:36:21,545 --> 00:36:23,252
From what I gather about
the history of this place,

656
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,055
the Scandinavians
and the Germans

657
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:27,358
did a lot of the settling
and initial taming of the land

658
00:36:27,384 --> 00:36:29,728
and plowing the crops
and so forth.

659
00:36:33,156 --> 00:36:35,227
But it was hard work,
and they were a hardy people,

660
00:36:35,258 --> 00:36:36,635
really suited for this climate,

661
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,163
people like us
from Germany and Ireland.

662
00:36:43,567 --> 00:36:46,411
Because I'm a white nationalist
and a National Socialist,

663
00:36:46,436 --> 00:36:49,440
they're levying these laws
specifically to drive us out

664
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:51,248
because of what we believe.

665
00:36:51,274 --> 00:36:53,447
Which is against the law.

666
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:55,081
It's against
our civil liberties,

667
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:58,252
it's against
our First Amendment rights.

668
00:36:58,281 --> 00:37:01,023
And it's sad,
because that's white Americans

669
00:37:01,051 --> 00:37:04,692
hating on us,
who are also white Americans.

670
00:37:04,721 --> 00:37:07,065
And, uh, unfortunately,
whether they like it or not,

671
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:09,092
we're here to stay.

672
00:37:38,121 --> 00:37:39,429
Evening.

673
00:37:41,391 --> 00:37:42,529
Hi, guys.

674
00:37:51,635 --> 00:37:53,342
Leithans are thrust
into all of this.

675
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:56,317
Yeah-definitely something
we didn't want.

676
00:37:56,339 --> 00:37:57,784
Yeah.

677
00:37:57,808 --> 00:37:59,219
And he's not actually here
just now, is he?

678
00:37:59,242 --> 00:38:00,243
- No, he's not.
-I mean, he seems to be

679
00:38:00,277 --> 00:38:01,688
to-ing and fro-ing quite a lot.

680
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,460
Are you fighting a bit
of a losing battle here?

681
00:38:05,482 --> 00:38:07,325
No, I don't think so.

682
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:08,852
I mean, I think, ultimately,
I think we're gonna win it.

683
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:49,500
I have on the agenda
the reading of the ordinances

684
00:38:49,526 --> 00:38:51,164
for this evening.

685
00:38:51,194 --> 00:38:54,403
Uh, Mr. Todd Kelsch will be
reading them for us.

686
00:38:54,431 --> 00:38:56,274
It is important
to the health and safety

687
00:38:56,299 --> 00:38:57,801
of the citizens of Leith

688
00:38:57,834 --> 00:38:59,507
that each resident's dwelling,

689
00:38:59,536 --> 00:39:02,642
building or other occupied
structure in the city of Leith,

690
00:39:02,672 --> 00:39:05,414
have potable water
and a properly designed,

691
00:39:05,442 --> 00:39:09,447
maintained and operating
onsite sewage treatment system.

692
00:39:09,479 --> 00:39:11,254
A motion that we accept.

693
00:39:11,281 --> 00:39:13,318
The lead motion--
do I have a second?

694
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:15,352
- I second.
-Bobby seconds.

695
00:39:15,385 --> 00:39:16,762
Any questions
on these ordinances

696
00:39:16,786 --> 00:39:18,629
from the Council first.

697
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,567
'Bout time.

698
00:39:23,193 --> 00:39:24,399
All in favor, say,

699
00:39:25,662 --> 00:39:26,766
Opposed?

700
00:39:26,796 --> 00:39:28,469
<i>Motion passes.</i>

701
00:39:35,405 --> 00:39:37,646
Thank you.

702
00:39:37,674 --> 00:39:39,210
- How you doing, man?
-Hey, good.

703
00:39:39,242 --> 00:39:41,188
- You alright?
-Yeah, I'm doing okay.

704
00:39:51,621 --> 00:39:53,760
Craig Cobb will be served
sometime this week

705
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:57,260
with a 30-day notice
to hook up to city water--

706
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:59,604
Mr. Cobb, thanks for calling
in to the program.

707
00:39:59,629 --> 00:40:01,768
Are you in Leith right now?

708
00:40:01,798 --> 00:40:03,778
No, I'm actually out of state.

709
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,576
They didn't have any ordinances
on the books, Jay.

710
00:40:06,603 --> 00:40:10,449
All of this hoopla
about sewer and water

711
00:40:10,473 --> 00:40:13,249
was to try to,
basically, excoriate me

712
00:40:13,276 --> 00:40:15,256
as how could a man live
without these things

713
00:40:15,278 --> 00:40:16,518
in this day and time?

714
00:40:16,546 --> 00:40:17,718
Let me grab another phone call--

715
00:40:17,747 --> 00:40:19,283
Glenn in Missouri--

716
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:21,990
You got two white men up there
in one town

717
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:26,634
who are trying to make an area
that's safe for white people

718
00:40:26,656 --> 00:40:28,693
and the white race is done up.

719
00:40:28,725 --> 00:40:30,966
Simple mathematics proves it.

720
00:40:30,994 --> 00:40:34,498
Craig, you were challenged
to have a DNA test done

721
00:40:34,531 --> 00:40:36,875
to prove your Aryan heritage.

722
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,642
You accepted that
on your website.

723
00:40:39,669 --> 00:40:43,583
You will take a DNA test
to prove your Aryan heritage.

724
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:47,487
It's a brand new
season of Trisha.

725
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:49,922
Today, on a Trisha exclusive:

726
00:40:49,946 --> 00:40:52,893
You racist, bigoted ****.

727
00:40:52,916 --> 00:40:56,261
I'm prepared for
an all-out riot.

728
00:40:56,286 --> 00:40:57,629
Just step back.

729
00:40:57,654 --> 00:41:00,464
Craig Paul Cobb
has undergone DNA testing

730
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:03,494
to determine genetic ancestry.

731
00:41:03,526 --> 00:41:07,269
Eighty-six percent European...

732
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:15,946
Let's hear it.

733
00:41:15,972 --> 00:41:18,919
...14 percent
sub-Saharan African!

734
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:23,290
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

735
00:41:23,313 --> 00:41:25,623
Hold on.

736
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:28,562
Just wait a minute.

737
00:41:28,585 --> 00:41:30,758
This is called
"statistical noise."

738
00:41:30,787 --> 00:41:33,859
Sweetheart, you have
a little black in you.

739
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:35,392
Listen, I'll tell you this,

740
00:41:35,425 --> 00:41:37,462
oil and water don't mix.

741
00:41:37,494 --> 00:41:40,065
So, hey, bro.

742
00:41:42,866 --> 00:41:45,073
No, no, no.

743
00:41:49,506 --> 00:41:50,985
This guy had 14 percent
black in him,

744
00:41:51,007 --> 00:41:52,953
and I'm trying to figure out,

745
00:41:52,976 --> 00:41:56,947
how can you join a hate group
when you don't check your DNA?

746
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:59,790
He's black.

747
00:41:59,816 --> 00:42:02,057
Sin is great.

748
00:42:08,491 --> 00:42:10,698
The guiding principle
of all your actions

749
00:42:10,727 --> 00:42:14,766
shall be what is best
for the white race.

750
00:42:24,974 --> 00:42:26,681
It is our immediate objective

751
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,553
to relentlessly expand
the white race

752
00:42:28,578 --> 00:42:31,058
and keep shrinking our enemies.

753
00:42:35,585 --> 00:42:37,792
Here in Leith,
it's a constant struggle.

754
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:39,391
The people have done
everything in their power

755
00:42:39,422 --> 00:42:41,732
to make us leave.

756
00:42:41,758 --> 00:42:44,466
Our car was vandalized,
three tires were stabbed,

757
00:42:44,494 --> 00:42:45,973
and it was spray-painted.

758
00:42:45,995 --> 00:42:46,996
"Go home," they said.

759
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:49,010
Well, this is our home.

760
00:42:49,032 --> 00:42:50,943
We're going nowhere.

761
00:42:50,967 --> 00:42:52,571
Please file a report.

762
00:42:52,602 --> 00:42:54,411
This has been noted before
as harassing,

763
00:42:54,437 --> 00:42:56,474
so thank you,
and have a nice day.

764
00:42:56,506 --> 00:42:57,883
Enough is enough.

765
00:42:57,907 --> 00:42:59,614
Make these motherfuckers stop.

766
00:42:59,642 --> 00:43:01,417
Arrest them!

767
00:43:01,444 --> 00:43:05,824
I have numerous videos
of abuse and threats

768
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:07,055
from all these people.

769
00:43:08,885 --> 00:43:12,025
This guy has honked,

770
00:43:12,055 --> 00:43:14,763
come by to tell us to go home.

771
00:43:19,629 --> 00:43:23,600
E-S-T-A...

772
00:43:23,633 --> 00:43:25,010
I'm looking.

773
00:43:25,034 --> 00:43:28,481
You don't even belong here
(inaudible).

774
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:31,418
Our family's gonna be here
for a long time.

775
00:43:31,441 --> 00:43:34,115
Flipping us off,
telling us to go home.

776
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:36,488
We are home.

777
00:43:43,553 --> 00:43:45,499
This is the license plate.

778
00:43:45,522 --> 00:43:47,729
This is that fuckin' dude

779
00:43:47,757 --> 00:43:50,135
that I told to leave.

780
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,195
Can we help you?

781
00:43:51,428 --> 00:43:53,066
No trespassing!

782
00:43:53,096 --> 00:43:54,973
You are not welcome here!

783
00:43:54,998 --> 00:43:56,705
I've asked you to leave.

784
00:43:56,733 --> 00:43:58,838
You've been asked to leave
many times.

785
00:43:58,868 --> 00:44:00,211
I am recording you.

786
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:02,815
This is gonna be sent
to the police.

787
00:44:02,839 --> 00:44:04,716
Leave us alone.

788
00:44:04,741 --> 00:44:06,220
Leave us alone.

789
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:08,150
Leave us alone.

790
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:09,782
Leave us alone!

791
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,520
No trespassing!

792
00:44:11,548 --> 00:44:12,720
Not welcome!

793
00:44:12,749 --> 00:44:14,626
Leave us alone!

794
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:17,762
Yeah, I'm sure,
with all the vandalism--

795
00:44:17,787 --> 00:44:18,731
look at our car!

796
00:44:18,755 --> 00:44:20,029
I'm sure you love us.

797
00:44:20,056 --> 00:44:21,126
Get out of here.

798
00:44:21,157 --> 00:44:23,603
Leave us alone!

799
00:44:23,626 --> 00:44:25,105
Leave us alone.

800
00:44:25,128 --> 00:44:27,665
Grant County Police
will have their hands full.

801
00:44:27,697 --> 00:44:30,007
Leave us alone!

802
00:44:30,033 --> 00:44:32,104
We have a legal right
to bear arms.

803
00:44:32,135 --> 00:44:34,877
We have a legal right
to protect ours.

804
00:44:34,904 --> 00:44:36,747
If we weren't getting
harassed so much,

805
00:44:36,773 --> 00:44:38,616
we wouldn't have to do this.

806
00:44:51,888 --> 00:44:54,926
This is video documentation
that we're protecting our turf,

807
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:58,235
and not trying to be
threatening to anyone.

808
00:44:58,261 --> 00:45:01,140
Yes, they are carrying.

809
00:45:01,164 --> 00:45:04,702
This is Mr. Cobb
and my lover, Kynan Dutton,

810
00:45:04,734 --> 00:45:06,145
patrolling with sexy-ass guns,

811
00:45:06,169 --> 00:45:08,581
yes, it is.

812
00:45:08,605 --> 00:45:10,585
Stop the hate.

813
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:16,821
Make sure that we're both
in the camera.

814
00:45:16,846 --> 00:45:18,985
Oh, yeah--I haven't let you guys

815
00:45:19,015 --> 00:45:22,519
get out of screen
the whole time.

816
00:45:22,552 --> 00:45:25,055
Okay, you guys are going
quicker than I am.

817
00:45:38,868 --> 00:45:40,779
You know--hey, hey,
you son of a bitch Christian,

818
00:45:40,803 --> 00:45:42,305
I'll treat you
the same way.

819
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:43,813
Come on over here.

820
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,046
You think 'cause she's a woman--

821
00:45:45,074 --> 00:45:47,315
fuck you,
you little pussy boy.

822
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:49,717
Come on over here.

823
00:45:49,746 --> 00:45:52,886
We're going to property-

824
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,623
Hey, you fuckin' asshole!

825
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:56,324
You're runnin' us
out of this goddamn town,

826
00:45:56,553 --> 00:45:58,089
-controvertin' every goddamn--
-Kynan, you need

827
00:45:58,121 --> 00:45:59,794
-to get with him.
-And then you got the nerve

828
00:45:59,822 --> 00:46:01,824
to tell us we're the fuckin'
demented ones.

829
00:46:01,858 --> 00:46:03,235
Fuck you!

830
00:46:03,259 --> 00:46:04,329
Make sure you got us on camera.

831
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:05,596
I got it.

832
00:46:29,652 --> 00:46:30,653
Listen!

833
00:46:30,687 --> 00:46:32,064
Make sure it's on us.

834
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:47,810
Ah yeah, fuck you,

835
00:46:47,837 --> 00:46:51,751
that's your way of
putting me down, you shithole.

836
00:46:51,774 --> 00:46:53,845
-911, what's your emergency?
-Send the police right away.

837
00:46:53,876 --> 00:46:55,651
They're out there with guns,
they're yelling at my husband,

838
00:46:55,678 --> 00:46:57,385
-they've been yelling--
-Where are you?

839
00:46:57,614 --> 00:46:59,685
- We're in Leith.
-You're in Leith?

840
00:46:59,716 --> 00:47:02,663
- Yes, right away!
-Okay.

841
00:47:02,685 --> 00:47:06,189
Craig Cobb and Kynan Dutton
approached myself and Lee Cook

842
00:47:06,222 --> 00:47:08,395
with a shotgun and rifle
in hand.

843
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:10,161
I took photographs.

844
00:47:10,193 --> 00:47:12,173
Couple people wandering up
to my property

845
00:47:12,195 --> 00:47:14,175
with a couple rifles.

846
00:47:14,197 --> 00:47:16,404
Okay, what's your address?

847
00:47:16,633 --> 00:47:18,408
Where's Mayor Schock
in all this?

848
00:47:18,635 --> 00:47:20,945
Where's he, fuckin' sittin'
in his house

849
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:22,881
like a scared little bitch?

850
00:47:22,905 --> 00:47:25,283
Friggin' waiting for the cops
to resolve his problems for him

851
00:47:25,308 --> 00:47:27,015
since he won't do it himself?

852
00:47:27,043 --> 00:47:28,249
Wouldn't be surprised
if they don't come out

853
00:47:28,277 --> 00:47:29,347
and attack us
at a certain point.

854
00:47:29,379 --> 00:47:30,915
Good.

855
00:47:30,947 --> 00:47:32,187
I've been meaning to get
some target practice.

856
00:47:32,215 --> 00:47:34,217
Be sure--be sure--

857
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:36,093
be sure they fire
the first shot.

858
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:37,928
They have to fire
the first shot.

859
00:47:37,954 --> 00:47:39,399
- Well, I'll fire the second one.
-Maybe the second and third.

860
00:47:39,422 --> 00:47:40,958
Well, we might give 'em
a little more time,

861
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:42,833
depending how bad of an aim
they are.

862
00:47:44,293 --> 00:47:45,931
Okay, let's go back.

863
00:47:45,962 --> 00:47:48,101
Okay?'-

864
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:50,338
I'm not sure what the Christians
are gonna do, anyway.

865
00:47:50,366 --> 00:47:52,368
Make sure you have everything
in camera shot.

866
00:47:52,402 --> 00:47:55,747
Yup.

867
00:47:55,772 --> 00:47:57,774
Don't say too much, Kynan,
let me do all the talking.

868
00:47:57,807 --> 00:47:59,252
Same thing, Deborah,
let me do all the talking.

869
00:47:59,275 --> 00:48:00,948
I'm just recording.

870
00:48:00,977 --> 00:48:02,183
All the talking,
I'm gonna do all the talking.

871
00:48:02,211 --> 00:48:03,781
Make sure you get
this guy on camera, too.

872
00:48:03,813 --> 00:48:05,156
I got it.

873
00:49:07,043 --> 00:49:08,044
Come on.

874
00:49:08,077 --> 00:49:11,183
Not a word.

875
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:14,252
Well, they said they talked
to you on the sidewalk.

876
00:49:14,283 --> 00:49:16,320
Just don't talk.

877
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:29,806
Put your arms out, please.

878
00:49:29,832 --> 00:49:31,539
- Turn around.
-We got pocket knives.

879
00:49:31,768 --> 00:49:33,941
Okay?'-

880
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:35,449
How many?

881
00:49:35,471 --> 00:49:38,213
Uh, one in my pocket,
and one in my cargo pocket.

882
00:49:41,944 --> 00:49:43,150
Keep your other arm
out there, okay?

883
00:49:43,179 --> 00:49:44,385
Alright.

884
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:04,278
Yeah!

885
00:50:09,806 --> 00:50:12,343
He's been making headlines
in the tiny town of Leith

886
00:50:12,375 --> 00:50:14,082
since moving there in August,

887
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:17,319
but now, infamous white
supremacist Craig Cobb

888
00:50:17,346 --> 00:50:19,223
and Kynan Dutton
have been arrested.

889
00:50:19,248 --> 00:50:20,591
Prosecutors ask
that Cobb and Dutton

890
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:22,057
be held without bail,

891
00:50:22,084 --> 00:50:23,358
and the judge agreed.

892
00:50:23,386 --> 00:50:25,332
They face seven counts
of terrorizing.

893
00:50:25,354 --> 00:50:27,061
If convicted, Cobb and Dutton

894
00:50:27,089 --> 00:50:31,196
could face up to five years
in prison on each count.

895
00:50:31,227 --> 00:50:32,831
If we'd have made any movement,

896
00:50:32,862 --> 00:50:36,207
like we were going
for a gun or something,

897
00:50:36,232 --> 00:50:39,042
I'm totally convinced
they would have shot us.

898
00:50:39,068 --> 00:50:42,208
At today's preliminary hearing,
a Grant County judge decided

899
00:50:42,238 --> 00:50:45,117
there was enough evidence
to send the two to trial.

900
00:50:45,141 --> 00:50:47,417
The verbal altercation
and the mannerism

901
00:50:47,443 --> 00:50:49,150
which he carried a gun--
well, that time

902
00:50:49,178 --> 00:50:51,988
I felt like I had
a felony press.

903
00:50:52,014 --> 00:50:53,459
If it were up to me,

904
00:50:53,482 --> 00:50:55,860
and I'd've had my gun
on my hip that day

905
00:50:55,885 --> 00:50:57,330
instead of my camera
in my hands,

906
00:50:57,353 --> 00:50:59,993
I'da probably
shot 'em both dead.

907
00:51:00,022 --> 00:51:01,467
Nobody threatened
to shoot anybody

908
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:03,902
or any type of violence
or anything like that.

909
00:51:03,926 --> 00:51:07,135
It's strictly going on the basis
that people are saying

910
00:51:07,163 --> 00:51:08,608
that they were afraid.

911
00:52:38,654 --> 00:52:40,998
Appearing clean-shaven
and with a new haircut,

912
00:52:41,023 --> 00:52:43,435
Cobb entered a Grand County
court room today.

913
00:52:43,459 --> 00:52:46,303
Cobb's bail was set
at a million dollars cash,

914
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:48,002
and we learned
late this afternoon

915
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:51,068
the house Craig Cobb
owned in Leith has been sold.

916
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:57,011
Yeah, I bought it.

917
00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:02,113
He said that he'd be interested
in getting rid of it,

918
00:53:02,144 --> 00:53:05,125
and I said, "Well, I'll...
add it to my collection

919
00:53:05,147 --> 00:53:07,127
of stuff in Leith, I guess."

920
00:53:08,684 --> 00:53:10,357
I've no plans
of doing anything with it,

921
00:53:10,386 --> 00:53:11,592
I guess.

922
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:14,499
I mean,
other than cleaning it up,

923
00:53:14,523 --> 00:53:18,369
and keep the mice out of it
and bugs and--

924
00:53:18,394 --> 00:53:20,704
didn't really care
what he was doing, really.

925
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:22,505
I mean, taking over the town,
yeah,

926
00:53:22,531 --> 00:53:26,206
that kind of bugged me, but...

927
00:53:26,235 --> 00:53:29,341
anybody's--you can believe
whatever you want, I guess.

928
00:54:24,226 --> 00:54:27,264
It began with
the Southern Poverty Law Center.

929
00:54:27,296 --> 00:54:29,139
The Southern Poverty Law Center
has stalked me

930
00:54:29,165 --> 00:54:30,371
for about seven years.

931
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:32,640
This is literally
the fourth time

932
00:54:32,668 --> 00:54:35,547
via which they or their
operatives have done this to me.

933
00:54:35,571 --> 00:54:38,313
That is, stalked me,
gotten me fired,

934
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:39,614
gotten me evicted,

935
00:54:39,642 --> 00:54:41,588
gotten me run out
of countries, even.

936
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:44,284
And I'm not young, you know,
I'm an older guy.

937
00:54:44,313 --> 00:54:46,259
So, why don't they say,
"Just leave this cantankerous,

938
00:54:46,282 --> 00:54:49,229
uh, kind of, uh,
odd fellow alone?"

939
00:54:49,251 --> 00:54:52,095
No, they're not going
to do that, you see.

940
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:56,466
For some reason,
they simply will not allow

941
00:54:56,492 --> 00:55:00,304
the infinitesimal few of us
that there are

942
00:55:00,329 --> 00:55:02,570
to keep one another's company

943
00:55:02,598 --> 00:55:04,669
freely and openly.

944
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:09,172
In the early 2000s,

945
00:55:09,205 --> 00:55:10,240
the federal government
was cracking down

946
00:55:10,272 --> 00:55:11,751
on white supremacists.

947
00:55:11,774 --> 00:55:14,755
And there was a high-level
U.S. Attorney task force

948
00:55:14,777 --> 00:55:17,519
that was created
to deal with that threat.

949
00:55:17,546 --> 00:55:19,389
The last time
they were supposed to meet

950
00:55:19,415 --> 00:55:21,861
was actually on 9/11.

951
00:55:21,884 --> 00:55:23,557
The federal government, um,

952
00:55:23,586 --> 00:55:26,226
turned on a dime very quickly,
for obvious reasons,

953
00:55:26,255 --> 00:55:28,565
and focused almost all
of its attention

954
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:30,400
on Islamic extremism.

955
00:55:30,426 --> 00:55:31,564
Therefore,
the government was left

956
00:55:31,594 --> 00:55:32,868
with no intelligence agencies

957
00:55:32,895 --> 00:55:34,465
fighting back against
kinds of groups

958
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:37,706
that the Southern Poverty
Law Center tracks.

959
00:55:37,733 --> 00:55:39,644
That's pretty serious.

960
00:55:41,570 --> 00:55:42,844
You know,
there's a few hundred thousand

961
00:55:42,872 --> 00:55:44,681
of these people
in the United States.

962
00:55:44,707 --> 00:55:47,347
Some of them,
in the vein of Cobb,

963
00:55:47,376 --> 00:55:49,652
are willing to use weapons
in ways that are dangerous.

964
00:55:49,678 --> 00:55:52,488
Some of them
are willing to kill.

965
00:56:05,728 --> 00:56:06,866
I grew up in Missouri,

966
00:56:06,896 --> 00:56:10,241
and I had, I think,

967
00:56:10,266 --> 00:56:13,213
an upper middle class
background, I'm quite sure.

968
00:56:13,235 --> 00:56:16,705
So, that was privileged,
and I was glad for that.

969
00:56:16,739 --> 00:56:19,845
My mother was a teacher and my
father was a land developer.

970
00:56:19,875 --> 00:56:21,582
He was a 33rd degree Mason,

971
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:23,783
with a very high position
in that organization.

972
00:56:23,812 --> 00:56:25,849
I'd rather not
get into it, but...

973
00:56:25,881 --> 00:56:27,451
I spent a lot
of time reading,

974
00:56:27,483 --> 00:56:28,826
an inordinate
amount of time.

975
00:56:28,851 --> 00:56:30,694
I probably have
Asperger's syndrome,

976
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:33,893
which is a mild form
of autism.

977
00:56:33,923 --> 00:56:35,834
A month after
I turned 17,

978
00:56:35,858 --> 00:56:38,532
my father--
after a disagreement,

979
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,336
more than a disagreement,
a physical fight--

980
00:56:40,362 --> 00:56:42,638
he put me in the military
at two in the morning.

981
00:56:42,665 --> 00:56:43,871
Then I became a paratrooper.

982
00:56:43,899 --> 00:56:46,470
I took an IQ test
with 400 people

983
00:56:46,502 --> 00:56:48,880
in Kansas City,
I came in second.

984
00:56:48,904 --> 00:56:51,783
And they said that
I could go into the NSA

985
00:56:51,807 --> 00:56:53,878
and various things,
Special Forces,

986
00:56:53,909 --> 00:56:56,719
and, uh, but I would
have to re-up--

987
00:56:56,745 --> 00:56:58,224
I think it was
for six years.

988
00:56:58,247 --> 00:56:58,987
I said,
"I'm not gonna re-up.

989
00:56:59,215 --> 00:57:00,660
I was forced into this."

990
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:07,667
You know,
people don't like

991
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:08,691
the way I'm doing things,

992
00:57:08,724 --> 00:57:10,294
both on the left
and the right.

993
00:57:10,326 --> 00:57:12,328
And, uh, a lot of
those keyboard commandos

994
00:57:12,361 --> 00:57:13,465
never do anything.

995
00:57:13,495 --> 00:57:14,803
You know, I'm aged.

996
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:16,468
It's time for
young men to either

997
00:57:16,498 --> 00:57:18,375
make their stand
or lose their families

998
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,504
to this tyranny.

999
00:57:19,535 --> 00:57:20,707
This call will be
terminated

1000
00:57:20,736 --> 00:57:21,976
in one minute.

1001
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:47,398
Back in November when
all of these alleged victims

1002
00:57:47,429 --> 00:57:49,033
were spoke to...

1003
00:57:49,265 --> 00:57:52,303
every one of 'em
told us

1004
00:57:52,334 --> 00:57:54,746
without any reservation

1005
00:57:54,770 --> 00:57:56,511
that they feared
for their safety,

1006
00:57:56,538 --> 00:57:58,711
they feared
for their life.

1007
00:57:58,741 --> 00:58:00,277
After the pre-trial
conference,

1008
00:58:00,309 --> 00:58:02,653
Mr. Bruce loudly
and proudly proclaimed

1009
00:58:02,678 --> 00:58:04,817
he had no fear
of Mr. Cobb that day

1010
00:58:04,847 --> 00:58:06,019
or Mr. Dutton.

1011
00:58:06,048 --> 00:58:07,823
They were not
going to hum him.

1012
00:58:07,850 --> 00:58:10,330
I'm really not
afraid of Cobb and Dutton

1013
00:58:10,352 --> 00:58:12,059
at all, period.

1014
00:58:12,288 --> 00:58:14,393
But at the time,
as a photographer, you know,

1015
00:58:14,423 --> 00:58:16,630
uh, photographers
are weird.

1016
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:19,367
We just go after
the story and the film

1017
00:58:19,395 --> 00:58:20,703
and the photos
and so on,

1018
00:58:20,729 --> 00:58:22,640
and we don't really
think about any danger.

1019
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:23,871
When I informed him,
"if you were not

1020
00:58:23,899 --> 00:58:25,845
in fear for your life,

1021
00:58:25,868 --> 00:58:28,542
or your serious
bodily injury,

1022
00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:30,015
it's not terrorizing."

1023
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:31,746
He then made the comment
that he would make sure

1024
00:58:31,774 --> 00:58:33,617
he testified differently.

1025
00:58:33,642 --> 00:58:35,019
That's incorrect,

1026
00:58:35,044 --> 00:58:36,648
and I'm not gonna
call the man a liar,

1027
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:37,783
but it is incorrect.

1028
00:58:37,813 --> 00:58:39,588
I never said that.

1029
00:58:39,615 --> 00:58:42,721
Mr. Bruce has made
a real mess of things.

1030
00:58:42,751 --> 00:58:45,493
Todd Schwarz, the Grant County
States Attorney,

1031
00:58:45,521 --> 00:58:48,024
he dismissed the charge
against Craig Cobb

1032
00:58:48,057 --> 00:58:49,866
that involved me,
which was count two

1033
00:58:49,892 --> 00:58:51,769
of seven counts
of terrorizing.

1034
00:58:51,794 --> 00:58:53,865
"It is clear that
Mr. Bruce lacked

1035
00:58:53,896 --> 00:58:56,433
the requisite candor,
trustworthiness, and credibility

1036
00:58:56,465 --> 00:58:59,844
for this count
to be continued any further,"

1037
00:58:59,868 --> 00:59:02,849
and they dismissed it
with prejudice.

1038
00:59:05,474 --> 00:59:07,476
I cannot put
a witness on the stand

1039
00:59:07,509 --> 00:59:09,955
if I believe
he's lying.

1040
00:59:09,978 --> 00:59:11,116
We now have
a weakened case

1041
00:59:11,347 --> 00:59:14,794
because of...
no other way to put it,

1042
00:59:14,817 --> 00:59:19,095
somebody who has lied
or mislead law enforcement.

1043
00:59:19,121 --> 00:59:22,102
That has to be taken
into consideration.

1044
00:59:22,124 --> 00:59:24,035
As I sit here today,

1045
00:59:24,059 --> 00:59:25,834
it's looking like
this case will be plead out

1046
00:59:25,861 --> 00:59:27,499
in the near future.

1047
00:59:37,373 --> 00:59:40,047
Craig Cobb may be able
to avoid a trial in court.

1048
00:59:40,075 --> 00:59:42,077
A judge today agreed
to give prosecutors

1049
00:59:42,111 --> 00:59:43,749
and Cobb's attorney
three more weeks

1050
00:59:43,779 --> 00:59:45,087
to reach a plea agreement.

1051
00:59:45,114 --> 00:59:46,957
The judge still has
to accept the deal.

1052
00:59:46,982 --> 00:59:48,586
As of now,
a jury trial

1053
00:59:48,617 --> 00:59:49,994
is set for July.

1054
01:00:07,469 --> 01:00:08,743
I want your take on this.

1055
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:10,751
Do you think Leith
is being ridiculous

1056
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:12,411
by wanting to take
this whole thing to trial

1057
01:00:12,441 --> 01:00:14,045
when there's a possible
plea bargain

1058
01:00:14,076 --> 01:00:15,714
to get Craig Cobb
the hell outta here?

1059
01:00:15,744 --> 01:00:16,814
What do you think?

1060
01:00:16,845 --> 01:00:17,550
I wanna hear
from you next.

1061
01:00:17,579 --> 01:00:18,649
Jay Thomas Show.

1062
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:19,818
The 10 people
I've talked to,

1063
01:00:19,848 --> 01:00:21,054
every last one of 'em--

1064
01:00:21,083 --> 01:00:22,528
my next door neighbor,

1065
01:00:22,551 --> 01:00:26,124
uh, and the guys
that I have coffee and,

1066
01:00:26,155 --> 01:00:28,499
you know, doughnuts with
up in the cafe

1067
01:00:28,524 --> 01:00:30,197
in New Leipzig
in the morning.

1068
01:00:30,426 --> 01:00:32,531
Everybody agrees,
"What's going on?"

1069
01:00:32,561 --> 01:00:34,802
"Why isn't that guy
in prison yet?"

1070
01:00:34,830 --> 01:00:37,606
Uh, it's 100 percent
in Grant County.

1071
01:00:37,633 --> 01:00:39,169
Gregory, I gotta roll,
I'm out of time.

1072
01:00:39,201 --> 01:00:40,441
Keeping fighting
the fight, man.

1073
01:00:40,469 --> 01:00:41,447
We'll keep in touch.

1074
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:42,710
Okay, Jay,
have a good day

1075
01:00:42,738 --> 01:00:43,682
and thanks for your time.

1076
01:00:43,705 --> 01:00:44,945
You got it.

1077
01:00:46,141 --> 01:00:47,779
I'm pretty much stuck,

1078
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:50,450
because I won't leave
without my honey,

1079
01:00:50,479 --> 01:00:51,787
and, uh...

1080
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:54,090
even if he gets
released, if and when--

1081
01:00:54,116 --> 01:00:56,187
I'm sure he's gonna be
on some son of probation,

1082
01:00:56,218 --> 01:00:57,754
which is probably
gonna bar us

1083
01:00:57,786 --> 01:01:00,198
from leaving
North Dakota.

1084
01:01:00,222 --> 01:01:03,169
I almost wanna stay
just because

1085
01:01:03,192 --> 01:01:04,899
no one has any right,

1086
01:01:04,927 --> 01:01:07,771
no matter who you are
or what you believe in,

1087
01:01:07,796 --> 01:01:09,935
to make you leave just
because they don't like you.

1088
01:01:15,537 --> 01:01:17,778
One of the men charged
with terrorizing in Leith

1089
01:01:17,806 --> 01:01:21,117
is going free after
accepting a plea deal.

1090
01:01:21,143 --> 01:01:22,747
Kynan Dutton was
charged with seven counts

1091
01:01:22,778 --> 01:01:24,052
of terrorizing.

1092
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:25,558
Dutton's attorney
and prosecutors

1093
01:01:25,581 --> 01:01:27,026
made a plea agreement
that reduced the charges

1094
01:01:27,049 --> 01:01:28,494
to misdemeanors
and ordered him

1095
01:01:28,517 --> 01:01:30,793
to testify against
Craig Cobb.

1096
01:01:30,819 --> 01:01:33,197
He's been in jail
for nearly three months.

1097
01:01:33,222 --> 01:01:35,202
I'm just here
to get home to my family

1098
01:01:35,224 --> 01:01:36,601
and to help support them.

1099
01:01:36,625 --> 01:01:38,127
This has been rough
on us all,

1100
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:40,868
and I know that I can do
better for them, uh,

1101
01:01:40,896 --> 01:01:44,605
as a free man than I can
here incarcerated.

1102
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,757
So, I've got
my base batter.

1103
01:01:59,781 --> 01:02:01,886
And then last night
I made a variety

1104
01:02:01,917 --> 01:02:04,830
of competes.

1105
01:02:04,853 --> 01:02:06,992
So...

1106
01:02:07,022 --> 01:02:09,798
Yes, we National Socialists
cook normal food

1107
01:02:09,825 --> 01:02:13,898
and eat normal things,
do normal activities.

1108
01:02:13,929 --> 01:02:15,101
As long as I've
been a chef,

1109
01:02:15,130 --> 01:02:16,234
I've always said
that someday

1110
01:02:16,265 --> 01:02:18,609
I'm gonna write
my own cookbook,

1111
01:02:18,634 --> 01:02:20,045
and I'm gonna open up
my own restaurant

1112
01:02:20,068 --> 01:02:22,207
that features my food,
my creations,

1113
01:02:22,237 --> 01:02:23,978
my flavors.

1114
01:02:26,675 --> 01:02:29,178
Someday, hopefully,
I'll be able to, uh,

1115
01:02:29,211 --> 01:02:31,213
maybe use some of
this negative publicity

1116
01:02:31,246 --> 01:02:34,887
as a good promotional deal,
you know?

1117
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:36,897
Look at my nice cake.

1118
01:02:39,321 --> 01:02:40,959
What's your homework?

1119
01:02:40,989 --> 01:02:43,162
Homework from Miss Larson.

1120
01:02:43,191 --> 01:02:44,864
What's that homework?

1121
01:02:44,893 --> 01:02:48,033
Oh, it's--it's to look up
all these things

1122
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:49,770
star-ts with an

1123
01:02:49,798 --> 01:02:52,904
"N" like "No."

1124
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:54,209
No!

1125
01:02:54,236 --> 01:02:55,977
What other words
star-t with an "N"?

1126
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:01,114
Nickel?

1127
01:03:01,143 --> 01:03:03,214
- Nickel.
-That's a good one.

1128
01:03:03,245 --> 01:03:05,350
Nine.

1129
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:09,154
- Nine.
-Nine, that's right.

1130
01:03:09,184 --> 01:03:10,754
Really nice color.

1131
01:03:12,321 --> 01:03:15,165
Okay, there you go.

1132
01:03:15,190 --> 01:03:16,965
Regardless of how
one feels

1133
01:03:16,992 --> 01:03:19,097
about what we did

1134
01:03:19,127 --> 01:03:21,073
and how everything
went in Leith,

1135
01:03:21,096 --> 01:03:23,098
we had the balls
to do it.

1136
01:03:23,131 --> 01:03:25,338
It made me wanna
stand stronger, longer.

1137
01:03:25,367 --> 01:03:27,779
It proved to me
that the government

1138
01:03:27,803 --> 01:03:29,214
may or may not
be on my side,

1139
01:03:29,237 --> 01:03:31,342
that the police,
especially in certain areas,

1140
01:03:31,373 --> 01:03:32,852
are corrupt,

1141
01:03:32,874 --> 01:03:36,321
and that what I believe
is worth believing in.

1142
01:03:36,345 --> 01:03:38,621
It's cost me a lot,

1143
01:03:38,647 --> 01:03:40,388
but it's also
made me strong.

1144
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:18,055
♩  Happy birthday to you ♩

1145
01:04:18,086 --> 01:04:22,432
♩  Happy birthday,
dear Ryan ♩

1146
01:04:22,658 --> 01:04:25,400
♩  Happy birthday to you ♩

1147
01:04:26,962 --> 01:04:28,202
Do you have ice cream?

1148
01:04:47,382 --> 01:04:49,020
You had the--

1149
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:51,395
the motion in order
or what?

1150
01:04:55,891 --> 01:04:57,928
Right, right.

1151
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,837
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1152
01:05:00,862 --> 01:05:03,809
So, you're going ahead
to make the deal with Cobb

1153
01:05:03,832 --> 01:05:06,039
instead of going
to trial?

1154
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:07,445
What a liar!

1155
01:05:12,474 --> 01:05:14,147
I can imagine there's
gonna be some repercussions

1156
01:05:14,176 --> 01:05:16,156
on this deal, though.

1157
01:05:16,178 --> 01:05:18,180
Yeah.

1158
01:05:18,213 --> 01:05:21,217
Hey, Todd, Lee Cook.

1159
01:05:21,249 --> 01:05:24,059
I hear you're letting
the asshole out.

1160
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:25,793
Bullshit.

1161
01:05:25,821 --> 01:05:27,994
Bullshit.

1162
01:05:28,023 --> 01:05:30,367
I remember asking
you a question, you said,

1163
01:05:30,392 --> 01:05:34,135
I said, "Do you have
a pretty solid case

1164
01:05:34,162 --> 01:05:35,368
against Cobb?"

1165
01:05:35,397 --> 01:05:37,968
And your exact words
were to me is,

1166
01:05:37,999 --> 01:05:39,273
"I would not have
charged him

1167
01:05:39,301 --> 01:05:41,941
if I had not
a solid case against him."

1168
01:05:52,781 --> 01:05:54,351
The Nazi people,
I think they're all snakes.

1169
01:05:54,382 --> 01:05:56,055
And the only way
you can shut 'em up,

1170
01:05:56,084 --> 01:05:58,496
get rid of them,
is to treat 'em like a snake.

1171
01:05:58,520 --> 01:05:59,430
You gotta cut
their head off

1172
01:05:59,454 --> 01:06:00,455
to get rid of 'em.

1173
01:06:02,257 --> 01:06:03,998
The Health Department
condemned it,

1174
01:06:04,025 --> 01:06:06,164
so we're gonna
tear it down.

1175
01:06:14,970 --> 01:06:16,244
Give her a good tug!

1176
01:06:54,309 --> 01:06:56,346
It feels real good
to see that asshole's

1177
01:06:56,378 --> 01:06:57,982
property go down.

1178
01:07:28,476 --> 01:07:30,319
National Socialist Movement
still owns the land,

1179
01:07:30,345 --> 01:07:31,881
and we appreciate
the city cleaning

1180
01:07:31,913 --> 01:07:33,415
and clearing the lot
for us,

1181
01:07:33,448 --> 01:07:35,121
because now,
you know,

1182
01:07:35,150 --> 01:07:37,027
we have the ability to put
another structure there.

1183
01:07:40,055 --> 01:07:41,864
We appreciate it.

1184
01:07:52,267 --> 01:07:54,508
Multiple shootings
at a Jewish community center

1185
01:07:54,536 --> 01:07:56,174
on the eve of Passover

1186
01:07:56,204 --> 01:07:58,980
has left at least
three people dead.

1187
01:07:59,007 --> 01:08:01,419
Now, our cameras
were there

1188
01:08:01,443 --> 01:08:02,547
as that person
was placed

1189
01:08:02,577 --> 01:08:04,215
inside a police unit.

1190
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:06,988
Now, listen to what
the suspect had to say.

1191
01:08:10,318 --> 01:08:12,389
He was a decorated
Green Beret in Vietnam,

1192
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:15,333
but this guy's got
a whole resume of hate.

1193
01:08:15,357 --> 01:08:17,166
You know, most people when
they think about terrorists,

1194
01:08:17,192 --> 01:08:18,671
they think of young people.

1195
01:08:18,894 --> 01:08:20,373
In fact, there have been
a lot of old guys involved

1196
01:08:20,395 --> 01:08:22,306
in this kind of violence.

1197
01:08:22,330 --> 01:08:25,641
Frazier Glenn Miller,
an aging enraged anti-Semite

1198
01:08:25,667 --> 01:08:28,409
decided he was gonna go
and kill some Jews.

1199
01:08:28,436 --> 01:08:30,211
On Saturday...

1200
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:33,014
on the day before the Kansas
City shootings this weekend,

1201
01:08:33,041 --> 01:08:36,113
he was online posting
a public notice

1202
01:08:36,144 --> 01:08:39,125
that he had just spoken
with this guy.

1203
01:08:42,684 --> 01:08:45,460
He posted frequently
about me on VNN forum,

1204
01:08:45,487 --> 01:08:46,989
and said, you know,
"Right, Craig?"

1205
01:08:47,022 --> 01:08:49,400
And I would
talk to him frequently

1206
01:08:49,424 --> 01:08:51,597
and tell him how
things were going.

1207
01:08:51,626 --> 01:08:53,003
And he's dying.

1208
01:08:53,028 --> 01:08:54,371
He wrote me
on January 6th

1209
01:08:54,396 --> 01:08:56,637
that he had one foot
in the grave,

1210
01:08:56,665 --> 01:08:59,043
and one foot
on a banana peel.

1211
01:08:59,067 --> 01:09:00,341
The reason the
United States government

1212
01:09:00,368 --> 01:09:02,314
goes all over the world
and kills hundreds

1213
01:09:02,337 --> 01:09:06,251
of thousands of people
is because, uh...

1214
01:09:06,274 --> 01:09:08,481
to change minds,
if you will.

1215
01:09:08,510 --> 01:09:10,080
And, uh...

1216
01:09:11,379 --> 01:09:13,052
And so, these fellas
in the military

1217
01:09:13,081 --> 01:09:16,062
have been trained in these
kind of things, you see?

1218
01:09:16,084 --> 01:09:17,722
The three people
who were killed this weekend

1219
01:09:17,953 --> 01:09:19,432
in that shooting
in that Kansas City suburbs

1220
01:09:19,454 --> 01:09:20,728
were a 69-year-old
grandfather

1221
01:09:20,956 --> 01:09:22,560
named William Corporon,

1222
01:09:22,590 --> 01:09:25,127
and his 14-year-old
grandson, Reat Underwood,

1223
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:26,503
as well as
a 53-year-old woman

1224
01:09:26,528 --> 01:09:28,474
named Terri LaManno.

1225
01:09:54,222 --> 01:09:55,565
Why did Cobb's
good buddy

1226
01:09:55,590 --> 01:09:57,297
go on the rampage
when he did?

1227
01:09:57,325 --> 01:10:00,704
Obviously, he just snapped
at a moment's notice.

1228
01:10:00,729 --> 01:10:03,369
Just like Cobb
and Dutton can do.

1229
01:10:03,398 --> 01:10:05,173
I don't think it's out of
the realm of possibilities

1230
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:06,577
that this could
happen here.

1231
01:10:06,601 --> 01:10:08,205
Then people are gonna
finally take notice

1232
01:10:08,236 --> 01:10:09,681
and think, you know,
this was serious,

1233
01:10:09,704 --> 01:10:11,650
these people were
in danger this whole time.

1234
01:10:11,673 --> 01:10:14,017
But nobody seems
to take it that seriously.

1235
01:10:14,042 --> 01:10:16,579
I just--I'm afraid
that it's gonna take something,

1236
01:10:16,611 --> 01:10:18,147
you know,
closer to home,

1237
01:10:18,179 --> 01:10:21,217
drastic to happen
before people wake up.

1238
01:10:40,301 --> 01:10:42,508
You shoot all them bottles
till it's empty.

1239
01:10:42,537 --> 01:10:44,175
Should be nine
in there.

1240
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:48,581
I've learned
how to shoot

1241
01:10:48,610 --> 01:10:50,453
every gun we own.

1242
01:10:50,478 --> 01:10:52,116
Yeah, if you get
a little closer.

1243
01:10:54,582 --> 01:10:56,653
I have to know how
to protect my family.

1244
01:11:11,332 --> 01:11:14,779
And it's sad that my kids
have to see that gun.

1245
01:11:14,803 --> 01:11:16,248
They know
what it means.

1246
01:11:16,271 --> 01:11:17,807
Even if I don't elaborate,

1247
01:11:17,839 --> 01:11:19,614
they know
why it's there.

1248
01:11:23,244 --> 01:11:25,554
If Cobb gets
out tomorrow,

1249
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:27,287
it's a threat.

1250
01:12:18,266 --> 01:12:19,540
All rise.

1251
01:12:23,238 --> 01:12:24,581
Thank you,
be seated please.

1252
01:12:31,146 --> 01:12:34,559
We'll open Grant County
case 2013 CR 43.

1253
01:12:34,582 --> 01:12:35,652
The case is entitled

1254
01:12:35,683 --> 01:12:36,787
"State of North Dakota,
Plaintiff,

1255
01:12:36,818 --> 01:12:38,889
versus Paul Craig Cobb,"

1256
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:41,457
also known
as Craig Paul Cobb.

1257
01:12:41,489 --> 01:12:42,627
And you're Paul Cobb?

1258
01:12:42,657 --> 01:12:43,658
Yes, sir, I am.

1259
01:12:43,691 --> 01:12:45,261
The information
in this case,

1260
01:12:45,293 --> 01:12:48,638
alleged seven C
felony terrorizing counts.

1261
01:12:48,663 --> 01:12:49,835
Mr. Cobb, is there
anything else

1262
01:12:49,864 --> 01:12:51,502
you would like
to tell the court

1263
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:53,535
regarding the manner
of sentencing in this case?

1264
01:12:53,568 --> 01:12:55,946
Yes, Your Honor,
if I may briefly.

1265
01:12:56,171 --> 01:12:57,479
L, um...

1266
01:12:57,505 --> 01:12:59,644
I regret my actions,
I know I was wrong.

1267
01:12:59,674 --> 01:13:02,746
And I, um,
accept responsibility

1268
01:13:02,777 --> 01:13:06,224
for my actions.

1269
01:13:06,247 --> 01:13:09,490
And it was an unfortunate
confluence of circumstances

1270
01:13:09,517 --> 01:13:11,895
and bad decisions
on my pan, Your Honor.

1271
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:13,627
Okay?'-

1272
01:13:13,655 --> 01:13:15,293
I reviewed
the PSI report,

1273
01:13:15,323 --> 01:13:17,303
I've reviewed
the psychological evaluations,

1274
01:13:17,325 --> 01:13:19,362
I've reviewed
the victim impact statements,

1275
01:13:19,394 --> 01:13:20,964
I've listened to
the comments of counsel

1276
01:13:21,196 --> 01:13:22,834
and from the comments
of the defendant.

1277
01:13:22,864 --> 01:13:25,606
Based upon all
of those factors

1278
01:13:25,633 --> 01:13:27,408
and considering everything
I have read,

1279
01:13:27,435 --> 01:13:30,279
I am going to accept
the plea agreement today,

1280
01:13:30,305 --> 01:13:32,842
and sentence the defendant
according to that agreement

1281
01:13:32,874 --> 01:13:35,855
charges counts 1, 3,
4, 5, and 7.

1282
01:13:35,877 --> 01:13:38,323
The defendant will
be sentenced to one year

1283
01:13:38,346 --> 01:13:39,586
with all but time served,

1284
01:13:39,614 --> 01:13:40,854
suspended for a period
of two years.

1285
01:13:40,882 --> 01:13:42,486
He'll be on
supervised probation

1286
01:13:42,517 --> 01:13:43,928
subject to the same terms
and conditions

1287
01:13:43,952 --> 01:13:46,296
that he will be
on count six,

1288
01:13:46,321 --> 01:13:47,664
the C felony
terrorizing charge

1289
01:13:47,689 --> 01:13:49,691
the defendant will
be sentenced to one year

1290
01:13:49,724 --> 01:13:50,930
with the Department
of Corrections

1291
01:13:50,959 --> 01:13:52,597
and rehabilitation
with all the time served

1292
01:13:52,627 --> 01:13:53,799
suspended for a period of...

1293
01:13:53,828 --> 01:13:55,739
Judge David Reich
sentenced Cobb

1294
01:13:55,763 --> 01:13:57,765
to four years
of supervised probation

1295
01:13:57,799 --> 01:14:00,439
with 26 strict terms.

1296
01:14:00,468 --> 01:14:02,004
Cobb can't own
any firearms

1297
01:14:02,237 --> 01:14:03,511
for the rest of his life.

1298
01:14:03,538 --> 01:14:04,915
He is not allowed
to have any contact

1299
01:14:04,939 --> 01:14:06,350
with any of the victims,

1300
01:14:06,374 --> 01:14:07,944
including by computer.

1301
01:14:07,976 --> 01:14:10,980
A plea deal would be if
you're gonna serve 10 years,

1302
01:14:11,012 --> 01:14:12,582
let's plea it out
to maybe five,

1303
01:14:12,614 --> 01:14:13,991
you know what I'm saying?

1304
01:14:14,015 --> 01:14:16,393
But to walk out of jail,
come on!

1305
01:14:16,417 --> 01:14:18,624
That's ridiculous.

1306
01:14:18,653 --> 01:14:20,860
Cobb terrorized
that neighborhood, okay?

1307
01:14:20,888 --> 01:14:23,664
I live across the street
from this guy, okay?

1308
01:14:23,691 --> 01:14:26,968
I had fear every time
I walked outside my house,

1309
01:14:26,995 --> 01:14:29,874
thinking that guy was gonna
shoot me somewhere, okay?

1310
01:14:29,897 --> 01:14:33,037
I had to pack a rifle
on my own lawn

1311
01:14:33,268 --> 01:14:34,770
in fear of my own life.

1312
01:14:34,802 --> 01:14:36,748
I did not let
my family live there.

1313
01:14:36,771 --> 01:14:39,308
I did not let
my wife stay there.

1314
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:42,014
I did not let
my kids walk that town.

1315
01:14:42,043 --> 01:14:43,681
It's over today,

1316
01:14:43,711 --> 01:14:45,987
but on the other hand,
it's really not over,

1317
01:14:46,014 --> 01:14:48,460
because when will it
be over, you know?

1318
01:14:48,483 --> 01:14:49,985
When--when are we gonna
know that we're--

1319
01:14:50,018 --> 01:14:53,465
we're safe back in our homes
back in town?

1320
01:14:53,488 --> 01:14:54,967
Are we ever gonna
be safe again?

1321
01:14:56,557 --> 01:14:58,798
If you watch the videos
of Craig Cobb

1322
01:14:58,826 --> 01:15:01,705
in his City Council meeting
coming after me,

1323
01:15:01,729 --> 01:15:03,970
after me over
my murdered daughter,

1324
01:15:03,998 --> 01:15:05,602
let me tell you,
this guy ain't sorry

1325
01:15:05,633 --> 01:15:07,579
about nothing, okay?

1326
01:15:07,602 --> 01:15:09,741
It's a failure of justice.

1327
01:15:12,874 --> 01:15:15,480
I sympathize with one
of the victims a great deal.

1328
01:15:15,510 --> 01:15:16,955
One of the victims
has been through

1329
01:15:16,978 --> 01:15:19,549
something horrible
before coming to North Dakota,

1330
01:15:19,580 --> 01:15:22,584
and this just reminded
him of that.

1331
01:15:22,617 --> 01:15:24,426
Nobody should have
to go through it.

1332
01:15:24,452 --> 01:15:26,398
But I have to look
at what the law allows,

1333
01:15:26,421 --> 01:15:28,867
what's appropriate
to the facts of this case,

1334
01:15:28,890 --> 01:15:31,962
and what the likely outcome
would be.

1335
01:15:31,993 --> 01:15:36,066
And this is the
likely outcome.

1336
01:15:36,097 --> 01:15:38,008
So, you feel
justice was served?

1337
01:15:38,032 --> 01:15:39,375
<i>Yes , it was .</i>

1338
01:15:53,414 --> 01:15:54,722
Wanna get in back or...

1339
01:16:11,132 --> 01:16:12,110
Yeah.

1340
01:16:12,133 --> 01:16:13,510
North Dakota.

1341
01:16:13,534 --> 01:16:14,569
Yeah.

1342
01:16:19,474 --> 01:16:20,578
Is it just yourself?

1343
01:16:20,608 --> 01:16:22,610
- Just me.
-Okay.

1344
01:16:22,643 --> 01:16:25,783
Hi, this is Cobb,
I'm over in 234.

1345
01:16:25,813 --> 01:16:26,883
Please don't tell
any visitors

1346
01:16:26,914 --> 01:16:29,554
that I'm here or anything.

1347
01:16:29,584 --> 01:16:32,121
No, don't even tell 'em
I'm in the motel.

1348
01:16:32,153 --> 01:16:34,497
Okay?

1349
01:16:34,522 --> 01:16:36,160
Thank you so much,
I appreciate it.

1350
01:16:46,801 --> 01:16:48,007
Hey, Jeff,
this is Craig Cobb,

1351
01:16:48,035 --> 01:16:49,742
I'm calling from Bismarck.

1352
01:16:49,771 --> 01:16:50,875
Um, you may have
heard on the news,

1353
01:16:50,905 --> 01:16:52,179
but they let me out today.

1354
01:16:52,407 --> 01:16:55,877
I was quite startled
and stunned by it.

1355
01:16:55,910 --> 01:16:57,651
I think there's some
political reasons

1356
01:16:57,678 --> 01:17:00,124
because they even had
a representative

1357
01:17:00,148 --> 01:17:01,889
from the attorney general's
office there.

1358
01:17:01,916 --> 01:17:05,830
His mission was to affirm
that the attorney general

1359
01:17:05,853 --> 01:17:08,959
wanted Judge Reich
to go along with it.

1360
01:17:08,990 --> 01:17:12,460
So, uh, I guess they said
there will be a lot of jokes

1361
01:17:12,493 --> 01:17:13,938
about Judge Reich's name.

1362
01:17:15,596 --> 01:17:17,576
And, uh, thanks for
your help, Jeff,

1363
01:17:17,598 --> 01:17:19,737
and for coming down there in
the preliminary and all that.

1364
01:17:19,767 --> 01:17:22,077
Okay, talk to you
later, Jeff.

1365
01:17:22,103 --> 01:17:23,980
Hi, Tom,
this is Craig Cobb.

1366
01:17:24,005 --> 01:17:25,814
I'm free in Bismarck,
I'm pretty sure you've heard

1367
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:27,444
on the news by now.

1368
01:17:27,475 --> 01:17:28,647
But anyway,
I wanted to call

1369
01:17:28,676 --> 01:17:30,178
and maybe I'll
try again later

1370
01:17:30,211 --> 01:17:32,157
when you might be home,
perhaps after dinner

1371
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:33,955
if you're around.

1372
01:17:33,981 --> 01:17:35,927
And thank you very much for
all your communication help

1373
01:17:35,950 --> 01:17:37,156
when I was imprisoned.

1374
01:17:37,185 --> 01:17:38,926
And, uh...

1375
01:17:38,953 --> 01:17:40,091
Yeah, I have a felony now,

1376
01:17:40,121 --> 01:17:42,067
but, uh...

1377
01:17:42,089 --> 01:17:45,536
unavoidable under
the circumstances, I think.

1378
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:47,096
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

1379
01:18:24,966 --> 01:18:26,536
We even drove around town

1380
01:18:26,567 --> 01:18:28,240
going to the attorney
general's office--

1381
01:18:28,269 --> 01:18:29,714
- Yeah.
-And, you know,

1382
01:18:29,737 --> 01:18:31,216
trying to get a hold
of the probation

1383
01:18:31,239 --> 01:18:35,153
and parole office
to find out where he's at.

1384
01:18:35,176 --> 01:18:37,622
Either he's going
to come out

1385
01:18:37,645 --> 01:18:39,056
with guns blazing,
you know,

1386
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:40,787
to get us all back,

1387
01:18:40,815 --> 01:18:42,294
to get revenge,

1388
01:18:42,517 --> 01:18:45,123
or he's gonna
disappear.

1389
01:18:45,152 --> 01:18:46,961
Here's some...

1390
01:18:46,988 --> 01:18:48,558
You see how the boy...

1391
01:18:48,589 --> 01:18:50,762
To me, this one looks
similar to as I did

1392
01:18:50,791 --> 01:18:52,168
when I was a child.

1393
01:19:00,201 --> 01:19:01,612
This is our religion.

1394
01:19:03,271 --> 01:19:05,717
<i>Uh, the 16th Commandment says,</i>

1395
01:19:05,740 --> 01:19:07,811
"it is the avowed duty
and holy responsibility

1396
01:19:07,842 --> 01:19:09,788
of each generation
to assure and secure

1397
01:19:09,810 --> 01:19:11,721
for all time the existence
of the white race

1398
01:19:11,746 --> 01:19:14,192
upon the face
of this planet."

1399
01:19:14,215 --> 01:19:16,126
They're probably sorry
they let me out already, huh?

1400
01:19:30,565 --> 01:19:32,306
You know, when you spend
many hours online,

1401
01:19:32,333 --> 01:19:34,939
you know, sometimes
16, 18, 20 hours of the day,

1402
01:19:34,969 --> 01:19:39,179
it's very, um...

1403
01:19:39,206 --> 01:19:42,210
pleasant and familiar.

1404
01:19:42,243 --> 01:19:44,951
That's why we focus on the Jews
and the system they built

1405
01:19:44,979 --> 01:19:47,255
rather than whichever
nigger it happened to be

1406
01:19:47,281 --> 01:19:48,919
who carried out the murder.

1407
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:52,830
I have a reputation online
of speaking very...

1408
01:19:52,853 --> 01:19:55,333
"meanly,"
I guess that's a word.

1409
01:19:55,356 --> 01:19:57,165
Why? Because...

1410
01:19:57,191 --> 01:19:59,068
it shocks
the limbic brain.

1411
01:19:59,093 --> 01:20:02,131
It's to get people
out of their lassitude

1412
01:20:02,163 --> 01:20:03,801
of which they're--

1413
01:20:03,831 --> 01:20:08,644
by which they're mesmerized
and hypnotized.

1414
01:20:08,669 --> 01:20:09,841
And this is what Jews do.

1415
01:20:09,870 --> 01:20:11,247
They have this
verbal effrontery

1416
01:20:11,272 --> 01:20:13,718
and chutzpah that they
continue to manifest,

1417
01:20:13,741 --> 01:20:15,049
and it's not going to stop

1418
01:20:15,076 --> 01:20:17,181
until they're stopped
from doing it.

1419
01:20:17,211 --> 01:20:18,815
And one way to stop
them from doing it

1420
01:20:18,846 --> 01:20:21,725
is you, uh...

1421
01:20:21,749 --> 01:20:25,128
physically take apart
their molecules and atoms.

1422
01:20:25,152 --> 01:20:26,790
You know...

1423
01:20:28,623 --> 01:20:30,193
I felt that I could
make my mark

1424
01:20:30,224 --> 01:20:33,228
on white nationalism
by becoming a speech

1425
01:20:33,260 --> 01:20:34,762
or a thought criminal.

1426
01:20:37,064 --> 01:20:39,374
I've tried to do
my pan, and, uh...

1427
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:41,243
I really feel
these things.

1428
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:47,319
I just, I've always
seen North Dakota

1429
01:20:47,341 --> 01:20:50,015
as secluded or...

1430
01:20:50,044 --> 01:20:53,287
just safer.

1431
01:20:53,314 --> 01:20:56,227
It's not.

1432
01:20:56,250 --> 01:20:58,856
We live here,
we breathe here,

1433
01:20:58,886 --> 01:21:00,888
our kids grow up here.

1434
01:21:00,921 --> 01:21:02,923
It's not over.

1435
01:21:02,957 --> 01:21:05,130
Yeah, you can't stop
in the middle of the fight.
