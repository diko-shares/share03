1
00:04:53.511 --> 00:04:54.762
Go inside.

2
00:04:57.473 --> 00:04:58.892
Hurry up. Go on.

3
00:04:59.934 --> 00:05:01.102
This way.

4
00:05:03.313 --> 00:05:05.023
Go on.

5
00:05:07.984 --> 00:05:09.235
Hurry up.

6
00:05:20.788 --> 00:05:22.874
Ah. Yeah, this'll do.

7
00:05:23.708 --> 00:05:25.460
- Which one are you gonna have?
- Oh, I...

8
00:05:25.543 --> 00:05:26.836
No, that's mine.

9
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.214
Allez-up!

10
00:06:05.541 --> 00:06:07.335
How far are the trees, Danny?

11
00:06:09.212 --> 00:06:11.506
Over 200 feet.

12
00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:13.258
Yeah, I'd say 300.

13
00:06:13.341 --> 00:06:15.218
Long ways to dig.

14
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.347
We'll get Cavendish to make a survey.
I wish Big X were here.

15
00:06:20.682 --> 00:06:22.809
Willie, you think X got away?

16
00:06:22.892 --> 00:06:25.019
He'd have sent us word somehow if he had.

17
00:06:25.103 --> 00:06:26.896
Gestapo, you think?

18
00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.564
Either that or he's dead.

19
00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:47.000
- Group Captain Ramsey?
- Yes.

20
00:06:47.083 --> 00:06:48.751
I am Hauptfeldwebel Strachwitz.

21
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.296
Will you accompany me, please?

22
00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:53.423
- I'll look after your gear, sir.
- Right.

23
00:07:06.227 --> 00:07:07.854
Gruppenkommandeur Ramsey.

24
00:07:09.188 --> 00:07:10.815
Good morning, Group Captain.

25
00:07:12.025 --> 00:07:14.485
I'm Captain Posen, Von Luger's adjutant.

26
00:07:15.236 --> 00:07:18.489
Since you're senior British officer,
you are to be liaison

27
00:07:18.573 --> 00:07:21.034
between the prisoners and the colonel.

28
00:07:21.993 --> 00:07:24.704
He wishes to make clear to you
certain matters of, uh...

29
00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.498
The word is "policy"?

30
00:07:27.582 --> 00:07:28.875
Yes.

31
00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.126
Thank you.

32
00:07:32.337 --> 00:07:34.172
Come in.

33
00:07:44.682 --> 00:07:46.309
Gruppenkommandeur Ramsey.

34
00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.146
I am Colonel Von Luger. Please sit down.

35
00:07:59.405 --> 00:08:02.617
Group Captain Ramsey,
in the past four years,

36
00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:05.995
the Reich has been forced to spend
an enormous amount of time,

37
00:08:06.079 --> 00:08:07.997
energy, manpower and equipment

38
00:08:08.081 --> 00:08:11.084
hunting down
escaping prisoner-of-war officers.

39
00:08:11.167 --> 00:08:14.295
Hmm. Well, at least it's rather nice
to know you're wanted, isn't it?

40
00:08:15.296 --> 00:08:17.340
For us, it's not a matter for levity.

41
00:08:18.216 --> 00:08:20.218
There will be no escapes from this camp.

42
00:08:20.301 --> 00:08:24.639
Colonel Von Luger, it is the sworn duty
of all officers to try to escape.

43
00:08:24.722 --> 00:08:27.350
If they can't,
it is their sworn duty to cause the enemy

44
00:08:27.433 --> 00:08:30.186
to use an inordinate number of troops
to guard them

45
00:08:30.269 --> 00:08:34.065
and their sworn duty to harass the enemy
to the best of their ability.

46
00:08:34.148 --> 00:08:35.608
Yes, I know.

47
00:08:36.359 --> 00:08:39.404
The men under your authority
have been most successful.

48
00:08:40.321 --> 00:08:43.157
This man, Ashley-Pitt, for example.

49
00:08:43.241 --> 00:08:46.702
Caught in the North Sea, escaped,
recaptured, escaped, recaptured.

50
00:08:47.662 --> 00:08:51.290
Archibald "Archie" Ives:
11 escape attempts.

51
00:08:51.374 --> 00:08:53.876
He even tried to jump out of the truck
coming here.

52
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:56.295
Dickes, William.

53
00:08:57.171 --> 00:09:00.341
Known to have participated
in digging of 11 escape tunnels.

54
00:09:00.425 --> 00:09:03.886
Flight Lieutenant Velinski: Four escapes.
MacDonald: Nine.

55
00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:07.181
Hendley, the American: Five.
Haynes: Four. Sedgwick: Seven.

56
00:09:07.265 --> 00:09:09.016
The list is almost endless.

57
00:09:09.851 --> 00:09:13.688
One man here has made
17 attempted escapes.

58
00:09:13.771 --> 00:09:15.857
Group Captain, this is close to insanity.

59
00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:17.150
Quite.

60
00:09:17.817 --> 00:09:18.901
And it must stop!

61
00:09:18.985 --> 00:09:22.113
Colonel, do you expect officers
to forget their duty?

62
00:09:25.908 --> 00:09:26.951
No.

63
00:09:28.286 --> 00:09:31.539
It is because we expect the opposite
that we have brought you here.

64
00:09:33.833 --> 00:09:35.543
This is a new camp.

65
00:09:36.377 --> 00:09:39.130
It has been built to hold you
and your men.

66
00:09:39.922 --> 00:09:43.384
It is organized to incorporate
all we have learned of security measures.

67
00:09:44.719 --> 00:09:47.722
And in me, you will not be dealing
with a common jailer...

68
00:09:49.056 --> 00:09:52.226
but with a staff officer
personally selected for the task

69
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:54.061
by the Luftwaffe high command.

70
00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:59.734
We have in effect put all our rotten eggs
in one basket,

71
00:10:00.568 --> 00:10:03.571
and we intend to watch this basket
carefully.

72
00:10:04.614 --> 00:10:05.781
Very wise.

73
00:10:09.994 --> 00:10:12.455
You will not be denied
the usual facilities:

74
00:10:13.414 --> 00:10:17.502
Sports, a library, a recreation hall.

75
00:10:18.586 --> 00:10:21.130
And for gardening, we will give you tools.

76
00:10:21.881 --> 00:10:24.759
We trust you to use them for gardening.

77
00:10:24.842 --> 00:10:26.886
Devote your energies to these things.

78
00:10:27.845 --> 00:10:29.931
Give up your hopeless attempts to escape.

79
00:10:31.224 --> 00:10:33.893
And, with intelligent cooperation,

80
00:10:34.727 --> 00:10:36.562
we may all sit out the war...

81
00:10:38.773 --> 00:10:40.816
as comfortably as possible.

82
00:10:58.459 --> 00:11:01.879
- What do you do here by the truck?
- I'm stealing tools.

83
00:11:01.963 --> 00:11:05.341
- For stealing tools, cooler.
- I was kidding. I wasn't stealing tools.

84
00:11:05.424 --> 00:11:07.843
- Oh, you're American.
- Yes, and you're a German.

85
00:11:07.927 --> 00:11:10.471
Of course. Why do you come to Germany?

86
00:11:11.305 --> 00:11:14.850
- Why fight for England, your enemy?
- Enemy? What are you talkin' about?

87
00:11:14.934 --> 00:11:17.603
In 1812, they burned your capital.

88
00:11:17.687 --> 00:11:19.498
- That's propaganda.
- It's in the history books.

89
00:11:19.522 --> 00:11:21.440
- It's pure propaganda.
- I read it.

90
00:11:22.233 --> 00:11:25.111
Now go away from here.
If you steal tools, cooler.

91
00:11:25.194 --> 00:11:26.612
Yeah, no tools.

92
00:11:32.827 --> 00:11:34.370
Hey, Virgil.

93
00:11:34.453 --> 00:11:36.706
Hey, did you see the cooler?

94
00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:39.208
Boy, is it ever a big one.

95
00:11:39.292 --> 00:11:41.544
- I think they expect a lot of business.
- Yeah.

96
00:11:41.627 --> 00:11:45.339
Hey, those two guys who were with us
in the old camp, in hut 14 -

97
00:11:45.423 --> 00:11:48.092
I can't find 'em. You think the goons
left 'em behind or something?

98
00:11:48.175 --> 00:11:50.344
- I guess.
- Yeah. Hey, what were their names?

99
00:11:50.428 --> 00:11:52.346
It was Jackson and, uh...

100
00:11:52.847 --> 00:11:55.516
- And Dexter.
- Dexter. That's right.

101
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.227
Hey, I'm gonna see who else I can find.
I'll see you later.

102
00:12:23.336 --> 00:12:24.879
Hey, Danny, who are they?

103
00:12:25.588 --> 00:12:28.507
Russian prisoners. They cut down trees.

104
00:12:28.591 --> 00:12:31.552
- They keep them here?
- No, they take them out.

105
00:12:34.263 --> 00:12:36.098
Willie, cigarettes.

106
00:12:56.535 --> 00:13:00.247
Danny and I have a blitz in mind. Could
you put on a brief show for the goons?

107
00:13:00.331 --> 00:13:03.376
- Sure, man. What'll it be? An all-out go?
- Mad prisoner?

108
00:13:03.459 --> 00:13:05.920
- Choir practice?
- Knuckles, eh?

109
00:13:06.003 --> 00:13:08.214
- Yeah, knuckles will be fine.
- Give him the coat.

110
00:13:10.508 --> 00:13:13.552
- What are you doing with my coat, mate?
- What? It's mine!

111
00:13:13.636 --> 00:13:17.973
- Are you pushing me, you Canadian?
- That's mine, you Aussie son of a...

112
00:13:19.809 --> 00:13:21.143
Hey, that's mine!

113
00:13:22.853 --> 00:13:25.064
You leave my jacket alone. It's my jacket!

114
00:13:43.666 --> 00:13:47.211
I'll send you back
to the Commonwealth!

115
00:13:47.878 --> 00:13:50.798
Stop it! Stop this nonsense!

116
00:13:50.881 --> 00:13:52.591
It's all right. It's all right, mate.

117
00:13:52.675 --> 00:13:54.552
We're just
having a friendly little argument.

118
00:13:54.635 --> 00:13:57.304
- No more fighting. No more!
- All right.

119
00:13:57.388 --> 00:13:59.223
- Get back in your huts.
- Yes, sir.

120
00:13:59.306 --> 00:14:00.474
You too!

121
00:14:02.601 --> 00:14:04.603
Get away! Get back in your huts!

122
00:14:07.314 --> 00:14:08.399
Go on!

123
00:14:40.514 --> 00:14:42.433
Hey, Hilts. Hey.

124
00:14:42.516 --> 00:14:44.870
Looks like there's only one other
American in the whole camp:

125
00:14:44.894 --> 00:14:47.104
Some guy named Hendley
in the RAF Eagle squadron.

126
00:14:47.188 --> 00:14:49.982
- Hey, you got something goin' already?
- Shh, shh!

127
00:14:50.065 --> 00:14:52.109
See the way the goons
got those towers placed?

128
00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:55.029
- Yeah.
- There's a blind spot in the middle.

129
00:14:55.654 --> 00:14:56.739
A blind spot?

130
00:14:56.822 --> 00:14:59.784
A guy could stand at that wire and not
be seen by that tower or that tower.

131
00:14:59.867 --> 00:15:02.870
The one on the end is too far.
They'd never see me, especially at night.

132
00:15:02.953 --> 00:15:06.540
- You're crazy.
- You think so? Let's find out right now.

133
00:15:24.016 --> 00:15:25.810
Now, the next step's a little tricky.

134
00:15:26.602 --> 00:15:29.355
- You're not goin' out there?
- Not while they're lookin', I'm not.

135
00:15:33.275 --> 00:15:35.027
I think I'll take a little walk.

136
00:15:36.529 --> 00:15:39.198
March!

137
00:16:17.736 --> 00:16:20.447
- Danny, you speak Russian?
- A little, but only one sentence.

138
00:16:20.531 --> 00:16:22.700
Let me have it, mate.

139
00:16:29.915 --> 00:16:31.959
- What's it mean?
- "I love you."

140
00:16:33.168 --> 00:16:35.713
"I love you"? What bloody good is that?

141
00:16:35.796 --> 00:16:38.173
I don't know.
I wasn't going to use it myself.

142
00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:56.275
Halt!

143
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:05.117
Out. Out!

144
00:17:07.161 --> 00:17:10.456
- Ah, your friend, yes?
- Huh?

145
00:17:10.539 --> 00:17:13.250
And who vouches for you,
Lieutenant Velinski?

146
00:17:14.043 --> 00:17:15.544
Get out, Sedgwick.

147
00:17:52.998 --> 00:17:54.333
Hold it, hold it!

148
00:17:59.004 --> 00:18:00.965
- Your name?
- Ives.

149
00:18:01.632 --> 00:18:02.716
Ives.

150
00:18:03.759 --> 00:18:07.012
Ives. Oh, yes. Archibald Ives. Scots.

151
00:18:07.763 --> 00:18:10.099
The photograph doesn't do you justice.

152
00:18:10.182 --> 00:18:13.352
I'd like to see one of you
under similar circumstances.

153
00:18:38.585 --> 00:18:40.587
I will not take action against you now.

154
00:18:41.547 --> 00:18:45.926
This is the first day here, and there has
been much stupidity and carelessness...

155
00:18:47.302 --> 00:18:48.679
on both sides.

156
00:19:06.864 --> 00:19:08.949
Hey! Get out!

157
00:19:10.701 --> 00:19:12.995
Don't shoot!

158
00:19:16.707 --> 00:19:19.251
You fool! To cross the wire is death!

159
00:19:19.334 --> 00:19:22.129
- What wire?
- This wire! The warning wire!

160
00:19:23.338 --> 00:19:26.050
It's absolutely forbidden to cross it.
You know that.

161
00:19:26.133 --> 00:19:29.803
Yeah, but my baseball rolled over there.
How am I gonna get my baseball?

162
00:19:29.887 --> 00:19:32.639
- You first ask permission.
- Oh, okay.

163
00:19:34.141 --> 00:19:35.809
Gettin' my baseball.

164
00:19:35.893 --> 00:19:38.645
Stop this nonsense!
Get over the wire immediately!

165
00:19:38.729 --> 00:19:40.314
- Okay.
- You stay there!

166
00:19:40.898 --> 00:19:42.900
Out of the way. Out.

167
00:19:47.905 --> 00:19:49.907
What are you doing over here by the wire?

168
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:52.701
Like I told Max, I was trying to get -.

169
00:20:04.296 --> 00:20:07.674
- What were you doing by the wire?
- Well, like I told Max...

170
00:20:08.425 --> 00:20:11.637
I was trying to cut my way through
your wire because I wanna get out.

171
00:20:18.977 --> 00:20:20.938
- Do you speak German?
- Jawohl, Herr Oberst.

172
00:20:22.397 --> 00:20:24.900
- Wire cutters.
- Jawohl, Herr Oberst.

173
00:20:26.401 --> 00:20:31.073
I have had the pleasure of knowing quite
a number of British officers in this war,

174
00:20:31.156 --> 00:20:33.200
and I flatter myself
that we understand one another.

175
00:20:40.541 --> 00:20:43.752
You are the first American officer
I have met. Hilts, isn't it?

176
00:20:43.836 --> 00:20:45.796
Captain Hilts, actually.

177
00:20:45.879 --> 00:20:47.840
- Seventeen escape attempts.
- Eighteen, sir.

178
00:20:47.923 --> 00:20:51.093
- Tunnel man, engineer.
- Flier.

179
00:20:51.176 --> 00:20:54.513
I suppose what's called
in the American army a hotshot pilot.

180
00:20:55.681 --> 00:20:58.100
Unfortunately, you were shot down anyway,

181
00:20:58.183 --> 00:21:00.978
so we are both grounded
for the duration of the war.

182
00:21:01.061 --> 00:21:02.980
Well, you speak for yourself, Colonel.

183
00:21:07.401 --> 00:21:08.735
You have other plans?

184
00:21:08.819 --> 00:21:11.363
I haven't seen Berlin yet
from the ground or from the air,

185
00:21:11.446 --> 00:21:14.324
and I plan on doing both
before the war is over.

186
00:21:14.408 --> 00:21:16.618
Are all American officers so ill-mannered?

187
00:21:17.619 --> 00:21:19.413
Mmm, about 99 percent.

188
00:21:20.998 --> 00:21:24.251
Then perhaps while you are with us,
you will have a chance to learn some.

189
00:21:24.334 --> 00:21:26.044
Ten days' isolation, Hilts.

190
00:21:27.087 --> 00:21:29.298
- Captain Hilts.
- Twenty days.

191
00:21:29.882 --> 00:21:31.133
Right.

192
00:21:32.843 --> 00:21:34.761
Oh, you'll still be here when I get out.

193
00:21:36.305 --> 00:21:37.472
Cooler.

194
00:21:46.607 --> 00:21:48.775
- Name?
- Ives.

195
00:21:48.859 --> 00:21:50.694
Flying Officer Ives.

196
00:21:50.777 --> 00:21:52.779
Cooler. Twenty days.

197
00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:58.535
- Cooler, Ives.
- Pleasure.

198
00:23:37.175 --> 00:23:39.469
- Hilts.
- Yeah?

199
00:23:39.553 --> 00:23:42.264
What did you do in the States?
Play baseball?

200
00:23:43.015 --> 00:23:44.474
No, I was in college.

201
00:23:45.976 --> 00:23:47.477
- Say, Ives.
- Aye?

202
00:23:48.103 --> 00:23:52.190
- How many escapes have you tried?
- Oh, four over, seven under.

203
00:23:54.359 --> 00:23:57.571
- Tunnel man, huh?
- Sure, I am that.

204
00:23:59.448 --> 00:24:01.033
How tall are you, Ives?

205
00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:03.618
5'4". Why?

206
00:24:04.745 --> 00:24:06.413
Oh, just wondering.

207
00:24:08.165 --> 00:24:11.585
What did you do in college?
Study physical education?

208
00:24:12.127 --> 00:24:14.546
Chemical engineering.
Did a little bike riding, though.

209
00:24:15.213 --> 00:24:16.214
Bicycles?

210
00:24:16.298 --> 00:24:18.717
Motorcycles.

211
00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:21.011
You know, flat tracks, county fairs.

212
00:24:21.094 --> 00:24:23.430
Picked up a buck here and there.
Helped pay my tuition.

213
00:24:24.056 --> 00:24:26.266
Oh, I did a wee bit of racing myself.

214
00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:28.060
- In Scotland.
- Bikes?

215
00:24:28.852 --> 00:24:31.646
No, horse racing. Jockey.

216
00:24:33.815 --> 00:24:34.858
Jockey?

217
00:24:38.779 --> 00:24:39.780
Jockey.

218
00:24:44.576 --> 00:24:45.619
Hilts?

219
00:24:47.162 --> 00:24:48.622
Are you there, Hilts?

220
00:24:51.333 --> 00:24:52.542
Yeah, I'm here.

221
00:24:52.626 --> 00:24:55.003
Don't you have them in the States,
jockeys?

222
00:24:56.213 --> 00:24:57.214
Sure.

223
00:24:57.297 --> 00:24:59.424
They were the days.

224
00:24:59.508 --> 00:25:03.637
Saturday nights in towns like
Musselburgh and Hamilton.

225
00:25:04.262 --> 00:25:06.014
You had to fight off the birds.

226
00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:08.141
You know, birds.

227
00:25:09.059 --> 00:25:10.852
Girls, man. Girls.

228
00:25:11.978 --> 00:25:13.897
Do you not have them in the States?

229
00:25:16.358 --> 00:25:17.484
Hilts?

230
00:25:18.527 --> 00:25:20.070
Are you there, Hilts?

231
00:25:21.738 --> 00:25:22.823
Ives.

232
00:25:25.659 --> 00:25:26.868
What?

233
00:25:27.953 --> 00:25:30.956
You know the kind of clay and gravel
we've got here in the compound?

234
00:25:31.039 --> 00:25:32.499
Aye.

235
00:25:32.582 --> 00:25:35.502
How many feet do you think you could
get through in, say, eight hours?

236
00:25:36.253 --> 00:25:40.090
I could cut through this dirt here
like the bit on an end of an auger.

237
00:25:41.007 --> 00:25:44.010
But you know it's not the digging.
It's the shoring up with wood

238
00:25:44.094 --> 00:25:45.971
and getting the dirt out.

239
00:25:46.054 --> 00:25:47.597
That's what you have to worry about.

240
00:25:47.681 --> 00:25:50.600
No, it isn't, Ives.
You don't have to worry about that.

241
00:25:50.684 --> 00:25:53.019
But how are you going to get the dirt out?

242
00:25:53.895 --> 00:25:57.107
- What do they call a mole in Scotland?
- A mole.

243
00:25:58.567 --> 00:25:59.568
Aye.

244
00:26:02.028 --> 00:26:04.448
Well, what do you think, Navy?

245
00:26:05.615 --> 00:26:08.201
I must say,
it's an interesting first 20 minutes.

246
00:26:08.285 --> 00:26:10.412
I'd say we made fools of ourselves.

247
00:26:10.495 --> 00:26:13.790
As the sergeant out there says,
this is only the first day.

248
00:26:31.057 --> 00:26:32.100
Eric.

249
00:26:33.852 --> 00:26:36.688
Don't take too much notice.
The goons may not know who he is.

250
00:26:37.689 --> 00:26:39.816
- I'll pass the word.
- I'll tell the old man.

251
00:26:42.944 --> 00:26:44.279
He has arrived.

252
00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:55.790
The prisoner Bartlett is discharged
into your custody, Colonel Von Luger.

253
00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:08.678
I suggest
this prisoner Bartlett to be kept

254
00:27:08.762 --> 00:27:11.264
under the strictest security confinement
permanently.

255
00:27:12.891 --> 00:27:15.936
- Make a note of Herr Kuhn's suggestion.
- Jawohl, Herr Oberst.

256
00:27:16.019 --> 00:27:18.563
We have reason to believe
that this person is the leader

257
00:27:18.647 --> 00:27:20.774
of numerous criminal escape attempts.

258
00:27:22.901 --> 00:27:26.154
Squadron Leader Bartlett
has been three months in your care,

259
00:27:26.821 --> 00:27:30.367
and the Gestapo has only
"reason to believe"?

260
00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:34.454
If he once more falls into our hands,
he will not be so lucky.

261
00:27:34.538 --> 00:27:39.209
Air Force officer prisoners
are the responsibility of the Luftwaffe,

262
00:27:39.292 --> 00:27:41.002
not the SS.

263
00:27:43.046 --> 00:27:44.673
Or the Gestapo.

264
00:27:45.465 --> 00:27:47.717
At present, yes, Herr Oberst.

265
00:27:47.801 --> 00:27:51.596
That is why he is returned
for the moment to your care.

266
00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:54.349
Of course,
if the Luftwaffe is not up to the task,

267
00:27:54.432 --> 00:27:57.435
the prisoners will find themselves
totally in our charge.

268
00:27:57.519 --> 00:28:00.355
We regretfully are not
so professionally understanding.

269
00:28:05.902 --> 00:28:07.320
Squadron Leader Bartlett...

270
00:28:08.863 --> 00:28:13.243
if you escape again and be caught,
you will be shot.

271
00:28:15.203 --> 00:28:16.580
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

272
00:28:16.663 --> 00:28:17.789
Heil Hitler.

273
00:28:22.168 --> 00:28:23.211
Heil Hitler.

274
00:28:28.091 --> 00:28:29.259
Herr Kuhn.

275
00:29:12.344 --> 00:29:13.887
- Eric.
- Hello, Roger.

276
00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:16.556
- They dumped you here too.
- Yes. What's this one like?

277
00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.516
Well, it's new.

278
00:29:19.309 --> 00:29:22.437
Here. Let's find you a bed.

279
00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:23.647
Thanks.

280
00:29:39.954 --> 00:29:41.456
Come in.

281
00:29:44.292 --> 00:29:46.127
- Hello, Roger.
- Hello, sir.

282
00:29:47.295 --> 00:29:49.047
I'll put your bag in your room.

283
00:29:49.839 --> 00:29:51.049
Thanks, Eric.

284
00:29:51.132 --> 00:29:53.885
- How are you?
- As well as can be expected.

285
00:29:53.968 --> 00:29:57.514
The fellows wanted to put up
a welcome committee, but that's for later.

286
00:29:57.597 --> 00:30:01.226
- Yes, I saw Willie and Velinski with Mac.
- A lot of old friends here.

287
00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:05.105
- How long have you been here, sir?
- Arrived today.

288
00:30:05.188 --> 00:30:07.941
New camp, expert guards, the elite.

289
00:30:08.942 --> 00:30:10.610
Have you met the commandant?

290
00:30:11.861 --> 00:30:13.238
Yes, I did.

291
00:30:14.114 --> 00:30:17.075
What were the Gestapo
and the SS doing with you?

292
00:30:17.158 --> 00:30:19.911
Oh, they wanted to find out
who helped me to the border.

293
00:30:19.994 --> 00:30:22.122
- Who else is here? Cavendish?
- Mm-hmm.

294
00:30:22.205 --> 00:30:25.125
- Nimmo and Sorren?
- Griffith, Haynes.

295
00:30:25.208 --> 00:30:26.710
- Blythe?
- Yes.

296
00:30:27.836 --> 00:30:30.296
Almost the whole X organization.

297
00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:31.464
Almost.

298
00:30:32.674 --> 00:30:35.468
They cleaned out all the other camps
and dumped us in this one.

299
00:30:35.552 --> 00:30:38.805
As Von Luger put it,
"All the rotten eggs in one basket."

300
00:30:40.056 --> 00:30:43.393
There's madness in their method.
What about Tommy Bristol?

301
00:30:44.894 --> 00:30:47.188
No, but there's an American, Hendley.

302
00:30:48.773 --> 00:30:50.775
Is he a scrounger? Blackmailer?

303
00:30:51.401 --> 00:30:53.903
- MacDonald says he's the best.
- Good.

304
00:30:55.822 --> 00:30:59.033
Last of the tea
until the Red Cross gets through again.

305
00:30:59.117 --> 00:31:01.035
I scrounged this from Sedgwick.

306
00:31:06.541 --> 00:31:08.501
Did the Gestapo give you a rough time?

307
00:31:09.711 --> 00:31:12.505
Not nearly as rough
as I now intend to give them.

308
00:31:13.506 --> 00:31:17.719
Roger, personal revenge must be
kept out of what we have to do here.

309
00:31:18.261 --> 00:31:20.263
Too many lives are at stake.

310
00:31:22.432 --> 00:31:26.853
What my personal feelings are
is of no importance.

311
00:31:27.937 --> 00:31:30.774
You appointed me Big X, and it's my duty

312
00:31:30.857 --> 00:31:33.860
to harass, confound and confuse the enemy
to the best of my ability.

313
00:31:33.943 --> 00:31:37.113
- That's true.
- And that's what I intend to do.

314
00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:42.869
I'm gonna cause such a terrible stink
in this Third Reich of theirs

315
00:31:42.952 --> 00:31:45.538
that thousands of troops
that could be employed to the front

316
00:31:45.622 --> 00:31:47.332
will be tied up here looking after us.

317
00:31:47.415 --> 00:31:48.666
How?

318
00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:50.835
By putting more men out of this...

319
00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:54.798
perfect camp of theirs
than have ever escaped before.

320
00:31:54.881 --> 00:31:58.051
Oh, not blitzing out two or three
or a dozen, but 200, 300.

321
00:31:58.134 --> 00:31:59.886
Scatter them all over Germany.

322
00:31:59.969 --> 00:32:02.323
- Do you think that's possible?
- The men are here to do it.

323
00:32:02.347 --> 00:32:05.558
The goons have put every escape artist
in this camp. You said so yourself.

324
00:32:07.185 --> 00:32:09.729
Have you thought of what it might cost?

325
00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:15.944
I've thought of the humiliation
if we just tamely submit,

326
00:32:16.736 --> 00:32:18.404
knuckle under and crawl.

327
00:32:19.197 --> 00:32:21.199
Surely you don't advocate that,
do you, sir?

328
00:32:22.367 --> 00:32:25.203
I have to point out one thing to you,
Roger.

329
00:32:25.286 --> 00:32:28.331
No matter how unsatisfactory
this camp may be,

330
00:32:28.414 --> 00:32:31.584
the high command have still left us
in the hands of the Luftwaffe,

331
00:32:31.668 --> 00:32:33.503
not the Gestapo and the SS.

332
00:32:35.713 --> 00:32:38.174
Look, sir, you, uh - you talk about

333
00:32:38.258 --> 00:32:41.427
the high command and the Luftwaffe,
then about the SS and the Gestapo.

334
00:32:41.511 --> 00:32:44.472
To me they're the same.
We're fighting the bloody lot.

335
00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:47.433
There's only one way to put it, sir.

336
00:32:47.517 --> 00:32:50.645
They are the common enemies
of everyone who believes in freedom.

337
00:32:51.312 --> 00:32:54.399
If the high command didn't approve
of Hitler, why didn't they throw him out?

338
00:32:54.482 --> 00:32:56.234
I have no argument with you, Roger.

339
00:32:57.235 --> 00:33:00.947
As senior officer,
I'm merely pointing out a pertinent fact.

340
00:33:04.701 --> 00:33:06.953
When are you calling a meeting, X?

341
00:33:15.253 --> 00:33:16.379
Tonight.

342
00:33:28.474 --> 00:33:29.726
Gentlemen,

343
00:33:29.809 --> 00:33:34.022
no doubt you've heard the immortal words
of our new commandant:

344
00:33:34.731 --> 00:33:37.066
"Devote your energies to things
other than escape

345
00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:40.111
and sit out the war
as comfortably as possible."

346
00:33:42.113 --> 00:33:44.449
Well, that's exactly
what we're going to do.

347
00:33:45.325 --> 00:33:48.578
We're going to devote our energies
to sports and gardening,

348
00:33:48.661 --> 00:33:51.539
all the cultural pursuits
as far as they're concerned.

349
00:33:51.623 --> 00:33:54.000
In fact,
we're going to put the goons to sleep.

350
00:33:55.501 --> 00:33:58.171
Meanwhile, we dig.

351
00:33:59.839 --> 00:34:02.842
Now, even a superficial look
at the compound

352
00:34:02.926 --> 00:34:06.095
shows us that huts 104 and 105
are closest to the woods.

353
00:34:06.179 --> 00:34:08.598
The first tunnel goes out from 105

354
00:34:08.681 --> 00:34:11.726
directly east under the Vorlager,
the cooler and the wire.

355
00:34:11.809 --> 00:34:13.978
But that's over 300 feet, Roger.

356
00:34:14.062 --> 00:34:17.023
- Did you make a survey, Dennis?
- Only a temporary one, sir.

357
00:34:17.106 --> 00:34:19.067
I make it just over 335 feet.

358
00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:20.985
Let me know when you've got an exact one.

359
00:34:21.069 --> 00:34:24.864
Willie, this time we'll dig straight down
30 feet before we go horizontal.

360
00:34:24.948 --> 00:34:27.533
That'll rule out any question
of sound detection or probing.

361
00:34:28.368 --> 00:34:31.663
All right, Roger.
But did you say the first tunnel?

362
00:34:31.746 --> 00:34:34.457
I did. There'll be three.

363
00:34:36.250 --> 00:34:40.421
We'll call them Tom, Dick and Harry.
Tom goes out directly east from 104,

364
00:34:40.505 --> 00:34:42.507
Dick goes north from the kitchen,

365
00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:45.385
and Harry goes out parallel to Tom
from 105.

366
00:34:47.095 --> 00:34:50.223
If the goons find one,
we'll move into the other.

367
00:34:51.015 --> 00:34:53.351
How many men do you plan to take out,
Roger?

368
00:34:54.644 --> 00:34:56.145
Two hundred and fifty.

369
00:34:57.271 --> 00:34:59.166
There'll be no half measures this time,
gentlemen.

370
00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:01.818
There'll be identification papers
and documents for everyone.

371
00:35:01.901 --> 00:35:04.988
And, Griff,
we'll need outfits for the lot.

372
00:35:05.071 --> 00:35:07.907
- Two hundred and fifty?
- Mostly civilian clothes.

373
00:35:07.991 --> 00:35:09.534
Yes, but, uh...

374
00:35:11.411 --> 00:35:12.870
Okay, Roger.

375
00:35:12.954 --> 00:35:17.667
Mac, maps, blankets, rations,
compasses for all the walkers,

376
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:19.335
and timetables for every train.

377
00:35:19.419 --> 00:35:21.379
Right, Roger.

378
00:35:26.009 --> 00:35:27.427
Sorry I'm late, Roger.

379
00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:30.221
It's all right, Colin. Sit down.
We're going to tunnel.

380
00:35:32.682 --> 00:35:33.808
Splendid.

381
00:35:35.101 --> 00:35:37.997
Willie, you and Danny'll be tunnel kings.
Danny, you'll be in charge of traps.

382
00:35:38.021 --> 00:35:40.648
I'll work out the exact location
with you tomorrow.

383
00:35:40.732 --> 00:35:43.860
Sedgwick, manufacturer.
Griff, as I said, tailor.

384
00:35:43.943 --> 00:35:45.820
Nimmo and Haynes, diversions.

385
00:35:45.903 --> 00:35:48.197
Mac, of course,
will take care of intelligence.

386
00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:51.534
Hendley. We haven't met.

387
00:35:51.617 --> 00:35:53.077
- Scrounger?
- Right.

388
00:35:54.579 --> 00:35:56.998
Dennis, maps and surveys.

389
00:35:57.081 --> 00:35:59.042
Colin, you'll take your usual job.

390
00:35:59.751 --> 00:36:01.812
Eric, have you thought
how you're gonna get rid of this dirt?

391
00:36:01.836 --> 00:36:04.213
Yes, I have. Usual places.

392
00:36:04.297 --> 00:36:06.716
Hadn't anticipated three tunnels,
but we'll manage.

393
00:36:06.799 --> 00:36:10.136
Roger, who's gonna handle security
for all this?

394
00:36:10.219 --> 00:36:11.345
You are.

395
00:36:12.221 --> 00:36:15.433
I want a system of stooges covering
this compound from front to back,

396
00:36:15.516 --> 00:36:18.394
checking every goon in and out.

397
00:36:18.478 --> 00:36:21.105
I want a signal system so perfect

398
00:36:21.189 --> 00:36:24.334
that if ever a ferret gets within 50 feet
of any of the huts in which we're working,

399
00:36:24.358 --> 00:36:26.319
we can shut down without a sign.

400
00:36:28.905 --> 00:36:32.325
Well, I don't think there's much point
in discussing any more now.

401
00:36:32.408 --> 00:36:34.494
I'll meet each of you
on the exercise circuit,

402
00:36:34.577 --> 00:36:36.913
and we'll pound out the details.

403
00:36:39.874 --> 00:36:41.250
Nothing else, is there, Mac?

404
00:36:42.001 --> 00:36:43.753
I shouldn't think so, Roger.

405
00:37:09.946 --> 00:37:11.030
Oh, hello.

406
00:37:12.073 --> 00:37:13.658
My name's Blythe.

407
00:37:15.034 --> 00:37:16.035
Hendley.

408
00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:23.835
- For birds.
- I used to do a little hunting myself.

409
00:37:23.918 --> 00:37:26.045
Oh, not hunting. Watching.

410
00:37:27.296 --> 00:37:30.174
Oh, a bird-watcher?

411
00:37:30.258 --> 00:37:33.970
Yes, that's right.
Watching them and, uh, drawing them.

412
00:37:37.181 --> 00:37:39.021
I suppose you have bird-watchers
in the States?

413
00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:41.561
Yes, we have some.

414
00:37:43.146 --> 00:37:44.230
Tea?

415
00:37:45.356 --> 00:37:47.859
I only drank tea once, in the hospital.

416
00:37:49.944 --> 00:37:51.737
Where's your kit?

417
00:37:51.821 --> 00:37:55.366
This is it. The rest was confiscated
in the last shakedown.

418
00:37:56.742 --> 00:38:00.872
The goons didn't appreciate
some of my more personal items.

419
00:38:04.834 --> 00:38:06.169
Such as.

420
00:38:06.252 --> 00:38:09.964
- You're the scrounger.
- Yes, that's right.

421
00:38:10.798 --> 00:38:12.508
I'll need a camera.

422
00:38:13.885 --> 00:38:16.470
- What kind?
- A good one.

423
00:38:16.554 --> 00:38:19.098
A 35-millimeter f/2.8

424
00:38:19.182 --> 00:38:21.809
with a focal-plane shutter
should do all right.

425
00:38:24.562 --> 00:38:26.898
- All right.
- And film, of course.

426
00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:30.193
Oh, of course.

427
00:38:30.276 --> 00:38:33.905
Oh, Hendley. I need a pick.
Big, heavy one.

428
00:38:33.988 --> 00:38:36.032
- Only one?
- Two would be better.

429
00:38:41.162 --> 00:38:42.830
I'm afraid this tea is pathetic.

430
00:38:43.623 --> 00:38:46.792
I must have used these wretched leaves
about 20 times.

431
00:38:47.835 --> 00:38:49.712
It's not that I mind so much.

432
00:38:50.463 --> 00:38:52.798
Tea without milk is so uncivilized.

433
00:38:53.841 --> 00:38:54.926
Yeah.

434
00:38:56.052 --> 00:38:57.428
I'll get our wood.

435
00:39:05.228 --> 00:39:07.063
Close up! Close up!

436
00:39:15.196 --> 00:39:16.280
Close up!

437
00:39:18.866 --> 00:39:20.576
- Close up!
- Hmm?

438
00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:23.204
- Close up! Close up!
- No me sprechen Sie English.

439
00:39:23.287 --> 00:39:24.413
Close up!

440
00:39:50.022 --> 00:39:51.232
Splendid.

441
00:40:04.495 --> 00:40:05.997
Blythe, what are you doing here?

442
00:40:08.124 --> 00:40:12.003
I'm in Photographic Aerial
Reconnaissance Interpretation.

443
00:40:12.086 --> 00:40:15.923
Went for a joyride to see for myself.
It's my own silly fault.

444
00:40:16.007 --> 00:40:17.925
The aircraft bought it.

445
00:40:18.009 --> 00:40:20.761
Got shot down. Terrifying.

446
00:40:21.429 --> 00:40:24.056
No, I mean, what do you do here?

447
00:40:24.765 --> 00:40:25.766
Here?

448
00:40:26.684 --> 00:40:29.312
Oh. I'm the forger.

449
00:40:49.874 --> 00:40:52.960
The forgers are installing themselves
in the recreation hut.

450
00:40:53.044 --> 00:40:54.670
- Sedgwick?
- I'm in 110.

451
00:40:54.754 --> 00:40:58.132
- Griffith.
- Well, I'd like to work in 109, Roger.

452
00:40:58.215 --> 00:41:00.593
109? Right.

453
00:41:00.676 --> 00:41:02.094
I'll work in 107.

454
00:41:02.178 --> 00:41:05.139
For now, Danny and Willie
and their trap team will be in 104.

455
00:41:05.222 --> 00:41:07.475
Mac, I want to take a chance
on the tunnels

456
00:41:07.558 --> 00:41:09.518
and press ahead without any shoring-up.

457
00:41:09.602 --> 00:41:12.772
But we will need timber, of course,
for the shafts and the entrance chambers.

458
00:41:12.855 --> 00:41:15.566
Now, Hendley figures
there are 36 empty bunks.

459
00:41:15.649 --> 00:41:19.111
We can tear up 15 and move the men back
and forth so the goons won't miss them.

460
00:41:19.195 --> 00:41:21.795
The rest will come from strips
off the wall, as we've always done.

461
00:41:21.864 --> 00:41:24.533
- Is Hendley taking care of this himself?
- Not yet.

462
00:41:24.617 --> 00:41:27.661
He's working on some steel
for a pick that Danny needs.

463
00:41:45.638 --> 00:41:48.224
Hey! What the hell is going on here?

464
00:41:48.307 --> 00:41:50.684
Turn the water off! Get your hands away!

465
00:41:50.768 --> 00:41:53.729
Get away!

466
00:41:54.855 --> 00:41:57.233
Hey! What the hell's going on there?

467
00:41:57.316 --> 00:41:58.984
Turn the water off!

468
00:41:59.068 --> 00:42:00.694
Stop this nonsense!

469
00:42:01.862 --> 00:42:03.656
Will you turn it off?

470
00:42:03.739 --> 00:42:07.743
Get away, here! Turn the water off!
Somewhere!

471
00:42:21.757 --> 00:42:24.009
Turn the main valve off somewhere.

472
00:42:48.075 --> 00:42:51.162
In the stove, we keep fire burning always.

473
00:42:51.245 --> 00:42:53.372
This way,
the goons will not feel like moving it.

474
00:42:53.456 --> 00:42:54.832
- Good.
- Hendley -.

475
00:42:56.125 --> 00:42:58.419
Two tiles, they are chipped.
We need new ones.

476
00:42:59.128 --> 00:43:02.631
There's some in 113's washroom.
Should match perfectly.

477
00:43:02.715 --> 00:43:03.757
Good.

478
00:43:12.016 --> 00:43:13.934
It's going to be a bit tricky, Danny.

479
00:43:15.895 --> 00:43:17.938
Not when you're organized, Mac.

480
00:43:22.693 --> 00:43:24.945
- We're ready.
- Big enough?

481
00:43:25.029 --> 00:43:28.282
It's perfect. Right through
the middle of the foundation.

482
00:43:34.914 --> 00:43:36.332
Good luck to us, Danny.

483
00:43:55.601 --> 00:43:56.977
Why 17?

484
00:43:57.978 --> 00:44:00.356
This is the 17th tunnel Danny's started.

485
00:44:32.805 --> 00:44:34.306
- All right?
- Lovely.

486
00:44:49.738 --> 00:44:50.906
It's good.

487
00:45:00.624 --> 00:45:01.959
It's very good.

488
00:45:02.751 --> 00:45:03.752
Haynes.

489
00:45:40.664 --> 00:45:42.666
Get out! Get out!

490
00:45:59.350 --> 00:46:01.435
- Come out here!
- Out, out, out!

491
00:46:01.518 --> 00:46:02.936
- Here!
- Out, out, out!

492
00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:08.067
You're not in your hut.

493
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:10.778
- What are you doing here?
- Mopping up.

494
00:46:15.282 --> 00:46:18.160
- And you?
- Shower. I need a wash.

495
00:46:22.331 --> 00:46:25.376
I'm watching him. I'm a lifeguard.

496
00:46:29.838 --> 00:46:32.466
Put on warm clothes.
You might be outside all night.

497
00:47:08.335 --> 00:47:09.837
Aus!

498
00:47:21.515 --> 00:47:23.517
No, no. I vote no.

499
00:47:24.143 --> 00:47:26.437
Look, we've put the goons to sleep
exactly like you said.

500
00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:29.165
But just one thing like this,
and we're up the creek without a paddle.

501
00:47:29.189 --> 00:47:32.443
- We -
- Ah. Ives, sit down, won't you?

502
00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:34.820
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

503
00:47:34.903 --> 00:47:37.156
- Squadron Leader Bartlett, Captain Hilts.
- Hi.

504
00:47:37.239 --> 00:47:39.283
- Flight Lieutenant MacDonald.
- Hi.

505
00:47:40.159 --> 00:47:43.287
I, uh, understand
you two are contemplating a blitz-out.

506
00:47:43.370 --> 00:47:45.664
Where'd you hear that, sir?

507
00:47:45.748 --> 00:47:48.459
MacDonald. It's Mac's job
to know everything that goes on.

508
00:47:48.542 --> 00:47:50.753
We, um -.

509
00:47:50.836 --> 00:47:52.755
We thought perhaps we might talk it over.

510
00:47:52.838 --> 00:47:54.548
Why? It's only a two-man job.

511
00:47:55.299 --> 00:47:58.927
Everybody in the camp is supposed to
clear all escape attempts in advance

512
00:47:59.011 --> 00:48:01.388
with Squadron Leader Bartlett here.

513
00:48:01.472 --> 00:48:04.850
We, uh, don't necessarily
want to interfere. It's just that -.

514
00:48:05.976 --> 00:48:09.146
Well, what sort of blitz
were you contemplating?

515
00:48:09.229 --> 00:48:13.275
Well, we sneak out at night to a spot
I found near the wire, a blind spot.

516
00:48:13.358 --> 00:48:15.569
Then we dig down three feet,
take the dirt,

517
00:48:15.652 --> 00:48:18.781
spread it on top so it won't make a pile,
and then - straight out.

518
00:48:18.864 --> 00:48:21.450
Ives here is a tunnel man,
so he digs in front,

519
00:48:21.533 --> 00:48:24.411
pushes the dirt behind him,
and I stash it behind me.

520
00:48:24.495 --> 00:48:26.705
Then we burrow through the dirt
like a couple of moles.

521
00:48:26.789 --> 00:48:29.792
Then by dawn we're under the wire,
across the open space,

522
00:48:29.875 --> 00:48:31.794
into the woods and gone.

523
00:48:38.008 --> 00:48:39.092
Well, uh...

524
00:48:41.970 --> 00:48:44.807
- When do you intend to try this?
- Hmm?

525
00:48:44.890 --> 00:48:47.267
- When do you intend to try it?
- Oh, tonight.

526
00:48:47.351 --> 00:48:49.812
Uh, Hilts,

527
00:48:49.895 --> 00:48:52.981
this may not be quite the right time
for this sort of thing.

528
00:48:53.065 --> 00:48:56.360
Look, sir, I've been in the bag
nearly three years now,

529
00:48:56.443 --> 00:48:58.862
bloody close to being wire-happy.

530
00:48:58.946 --> 00:49:01.198
It's a blitz-out for me, or forget it.

531
00:49:02.074 --> 00:49:04.743
It'll work. I know it will.

532
00:49:12.876 --> 00:49:14.002
Good luck.

533
00:49:14.628 --> 00:49:15.754
Thank you.

534
00:49:18.382 --> 00:49:22.678
- Hilts, um, how do you breathe?
- We got a steel rod with hinges on it,

535
00:49:22.761 --> 00:49:25.597
and we shove it up and make air holes
as we go along.

536
00:49:25.681 --> 00:49:27.266
Good night, sir.

537
00:49:33.146 --> 00:49:36.191
Now, why didn't anybody
think of that before?

538
00:49:36.275 --> 00:49:38.735
It's so stupid, it's positively brilliant.

539
00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:42.948
Oh, but it'll bring every goon in the camp
down on top of us.

540
00:49:43.031 --> 00:49:45.492
I don't know.
Perhaps we're being too clever.

541
00:49:45.576 --> 00:49:47.619
If we stop all the breakouts,

542
00:49:47.703 --> 00:49:50.497
it may only convince the goons
that we must be tunneling.

543
00:49:51.248 --> 00:49:53.292
I hope it works.

544
00:49:53.375 --> 00:49:56.795
If it doesn't, those two are gonna be
in the cooler for an awful long time.

545
00:50:42.758 --> 00:50:44.009
Good, huh?

546
00:50:44.092 --> 00:50:45.886
Danny, it's bloody beautiful.

547
00:50:52.059 --> 00:50:55.228
- This is the dirt from the compound.
- This is from the tunnel.

548
00:51:02.235 --> 00:51:04.863
Wherever we put it,
they're going to spot it a mile away.

549
00:51:05.530 --> 00:51:08.075
Maybe we could put it under the huts.
The dirt's dark there.

550
00:51:08.158 --> 00:51:10.160
No, it's the first place
the ferrets would look.

551
00:51:10.243 --> 00:51:12.371
I saw one measuring the height
under a hut yesterday.

552
00:51:12.454 --> 00:51:14.331
Maybe we could dry it out
to the same color.

553
00:51:14.414 --> 00:51:18.961
- There are 50 tons of it.
- I was just thinking out loud.

554
00:51:19.044 --> 00:51:21.296
If you must think,
for God's sake, think clearly.

555
00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:25.258
Where the devil is Ashley-Pitt?

556
00:51:27.010 --> 00:51:29.680
We can't destroy the dirt,
and we can't eat it.

557
00:51:30.555 --> 00:51:33.016
The only thing left to do
is camouflage it.

558
00:51:33.850 --> 00:51:36.353
That's as far as my thinking takes me.

559
00:51:37.521 --> 00:51:39.982
Didn't they teach you promptness
in the RN?

560
00:51:40.065 --> 00:51:42.442
You'll never believe it,
but I think I have the solution.

561
00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:47.406
The problem is somehow to get rid of
this tunnel dirt over the compound.

562
00:51:47.489 --> 00:51:48.991
Well, of course.

563
00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:51.618
Would you mind?

564
00:52:02.087 --> 00:52:03.213
Now...

565
00:52:05.882 --> 00:52:08.593
you fill these bags
with the dirt from the tunnel.

566
00:52:09.261 --> 00:52:12.848
Then, wearing them inside your trousers,

567
00:52:12.931 --> 00:52:15.100
you wander out into the compound,

568
00:52:15.183 --> 00:52:18.770
where you pull these strings
in your pockets.

569
00:52:20.313 --> 00:52:21.815
Out come the pins.

570
00:52:25.235 --> 00:52:26.695
Eric, it's good.

571
00:52:26.778 --> 00:52:30.198
All you have to do is kick it in.

572
00:52:30.282 --> 00:52:33.076
Unless you're a complete fool,
the ferrets will never see a thing.

573
00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:36.371
It's indecently brilliant.
What do you think, Roger, eh?

574
00:52:36.455 --> 00:52:39.041
- We'll try it first thing tomorrow.
- I already have. It works.

575
00:52:42.377 --> 00:52:45.213
Mac, this is what we'll do.

576
00:52:59.853 --> 00:53:02.939
- A little present from Tom, sir.
- Ah, thank you, Nimmo.

577
00:53:11.406 --> 00:53:13.366
- Nice garden you've got, sir.
- Mm.

578
00:53:13.450 --> 00:53:14.701
Carry on.

579
00:53:46.483 --> 00:53:48.276
All right, let's look sharp!

580
00:53:55.617 --> 00:53:56.827
That looks sharp.

581
00:54:01.498 --> 00:54:02.916
Sir.

582
00:54:06.419 --> 00:54:10.382
Please, gentlemen, continue.
This is merely a routine inspection.

583
00:54:25.814 --> 00:54:28.316
- Good morning, Squadron Leader.
- Good morning, sir.

584
00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:32.654
I am sorry the soil here
isn't better suited to your men's purpose.

585
00:54:32.737 --> 00:54:34.239
We'll manage, sir.

586
00:54:44.124 --> 00:54:48.461
I must say I am surprised with the extent
of this activity, Group Captain.

587
00:54:48.545 --> 00:54:51.631
- Pleased, of course, but surprised.
- Surprised, Colonel?

588
00:54:51.715 --> 00:54:54.467
Fliers are gentlemen,

589
00:54:54.551 --> 00:54:56.803
not peasants to dig in the earth.

590
00:54:56.887 --> 00:54:58.346
So I am surprised.

591
00:54:58.430 --> 00:55:00.849
The English have always been
very keen on gardening.

592
00:55:00.932 --> 00:55:04.477
Oh, yes, but flowers. Is this not so?

593
00:55:05.478 --> 00:55:07.647
You can't eat flowers, Colonel.

594
00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:10.984
Good point.

595
00:55:29.085 --> 00:55:32.339
You know, I have the nasty feeling
he knows exactly what we're doing.

596
00:55:32.422 --> 00:55:35.592
- Maybe he does.
- You don't really think so, do you?

597
00:55:35.675 --> 00:55:37.719
If he does, we'll find out soon enough.

598
00:55:49.981 --> 00:55:52.108
- Morning, Bob.
- Andy.

599
00:55:52.192 --> 00:55:54.903
Here we are. Now, let's see.

600
00:55:55.695 --> 00:55:57.489
Biscuits, two packets.

601
00:55:58.240 --> 00:55:59.908
Coffee, two tins.

602
00:56:00.575 --> 00:56:02.244
Bovril, one jar.

603
00:56:02.953 --> 00:56:05.372
Cigarettes, six packets.

604
00:56:06.039 --> 00:56:09.125
Strawberry jam, Sorren's.
Blackcurrant jam, Cavendish.

605
00:56:10.252 --> 00:56:12.254
And marmalade, mine.

606
00:56:12.337 --> 00:56:15.966
Danish butter, Von Luger's.
I liberated it from his mess supplies.

607
00:56:16.049 --> 00:56:18.635
Oh, yes. And, uh -.

608
00:56:18.718 --> 00:56:21.429
And Dutch chocolate. Two bars.

609
00:56:22.681 --> 00:56:26.017
That cleans out the gift food
for the entire organization.

610
00:56:26.101 --> 00:56:29.354
Now, the first thing we need
is the new form of travel permit.

611
00:56:29.437 --> 00:56:32.399
The forgers have no idea what
it looks like and can't move without it.

612
00:56:32.482 --> 00:56:33.858
I'll see what I can do.

613
00:56:33.942 --> 00:56:37.487
And, of course, any other identity cards,
personal papers,

614
00:56:37.570 --> 00:56:39.823
documents you can put your hands on.

615
00:56:39.906 --> 00:56:41.449
Anyway, put 'em to work, Bob.

616
00:56:41.533 --> 00:56:42.659
- Right.
- Good luck.

617
00:57:26.369 --> 00:57:28.997
Louis, where the hell is the air pump?

618
00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:32.334
- Oh, patience is a virtue, Roger.
- Yes, I know, dear boy.

619
00:57:32.417 --> 00:57:34.919
But the diggers can only work
when the trap's open,

620
00:57:35.003 --> 00:57:37.172
and this is holding us up very badly.

621
00:57:39.382 --> 00:57:41.468
- Is it finished?
- Of course.

622
00:57:41.551 --> 00:57:44.220
- Why isn't it in?
- Working on the air ducts now.

623
00:57:44.304 --> 00:57:47.223
- But when will they be finished?
- One or two days.

624
00:57:47.974 --> 00:57:49.392
Does it work?

625
00:57:49.476 --> 00:57:50.769
Of course it works.

626
00:57:51.561 --> 00:57:54.314
- Will it give us enough air?
- As much as you'll need.

627
00:57:55.315 --> 00:57:56.316
Mac?

628
00:57:57.025 --> 00:57:58.193
Excellent.

629
00:57:59.611 --> 00:58:01.112
Have it in by tomorrow night.

630
00:58:13.166 --> 00:58:14.751
Got a light?

631
00:58:14.834 --> 00:58:15.960
Oh, yeah.

632
00:58:18.713 --> 00:58:19.756
Thanks.

633
00:58:20.507 --> 00:58:22.425
- It's pretty, isn't it?
- Yes.

634
00:58:30.892 --> 00:58:33.228
Oh, I'm sorry. Would you like one?

635
00:58:35.814 --> 00:58:38.983
I'll smoke it later, when I'm off duty.
Thank you.

636
00:58:39.067 --> 00:58:41.653
You probably have
a couple of roommates, huh?

637
00:58:43.363 --> 00:58:44.823
Beautiful day.

638
00:58:44.906 --> 00:58:47.951
Yes.
But I think it might rain later.

639
00:58:48.034 --> 00:58:49.327
No, no.

640
00:58:49.411 --> 00:58:52.872
Uh, red sky in the morning,
sailor takes warning.

641
00:58:52.956 --> 00:58:55.083
Red sky at night, sailor's delight.

642
00:58:55.166 --> 00:58:57.210
It was a red sky last night.

643
00:58:57.293 --> 00:58:59.254
I never heard that before.

644
00:58:59.337 --> 00:59:01.089
I learned it in the Boy Scouts.

645
00:59:01.756 --> 00:59:03.216
- You were a Boy Scout?
- Mm-hmm.

646
00:59:03.299 --> 00:59:04.342
- So was I.
- Really?

647
00:59:04.426 --> 00:59:07.429
- Yes. I had 19 merit badges.
- I had 20.

648
00:59:08.471 --> 00:59:12.267
I was working on my 20th
when the government abolished scouting

649
00:59:12.350 --> 00:59:15.061
and sent me into the Hitler Youth instead.

650
00:59:19.107 --> 00:59:20.608
Hey, Werner,

651
00:59:20.692 --> 00:59:23.194
you think you'll stay in the army
after the war?

652
00:59:23.278 --> 00:59:26.114
Oh, no. No. I'm not a well man.

653
00:59:26.197 --> 00:59:28.032
- My teeth.
- Your teeth?

654
00:59:28.116 --> 00:59:31.369
Yes. Ah, I could tell you stories
about my teeth

655
00:59:31.453 --> 00:59:33.413
that would make your hair stand on end.

656
00:59:33.496 --> 00:59:35.206
Our dentist here is a butcher.

657
00:59:37.208 --> 00:59:39.085
But don't tell anyone I said so.

658
00:59:40.462 --> 00:59:42.380
It's a soldier's right to complain.

659
00:59:43.214 --> 00:59:45.175
Maybe in your army, but here?

660
00:59:46.217 --> 00:59:49.012
One little criticism, and - Zzzt!

661
00:59:49.095 --> 00:59:50.638
To the Russian front.

662
00:59:50.722 --> 00:59:52.140
Is that so?

663
00:59:52.932 --> 00:59:53.933
Terrible.

664
00:59:55.018 --> 00:59:56.561
That's terrible.

665
01:00:02.358 --> 01:00:03.526
Werner...

666
01:00:06.905 --> 01:00:09.491
why don't we go into my room,
where we can talk more comfortably.

667
01:00:09.574 --> 01:00:11.201
I'd better not.

668
01:00:11.284 --> 01:00:13.661
If Strachwitz should see me - Zzzt!

669
01:00:15.163 --> 01:00:17.081
I was just gonna make some coffee.

670
01:00:19.709 --> 01:00:21.461
Some real coffee.

671
01:00:50.406 --> 01:00:52.408
Coffee, coffee, coffee.

672
01:00:53.451 --> 01:00:54.953
Where is it?

673
01:01:01.501 --> 01:01:03.795
Well, my grandmother
keeps sending me this stuff.

674
01:01:10.343 --> 01:01:12.303
Oh, yeah. Here. Take one.

675
01:01:20.937 --> 01:01:23.022
Yeah. Keep it.

676
01:01:23.106 --> 01:01:25.984
- Nein. I must go.
- Werner, Werner -.

677
01:01:26.067 --> 01:01:28.528
It's okay. You can keep it. We're friends.

678
01:01:28.611 --> 01:01:31.823
With you in the cooler, will we
still be friends? I must report this.

679
01:01:31.906 --> 01:01:33.992
I don't understand you, Werner.
Report what?

680
01:01:34.075 --> 01:01:36.369
That you and I were chatting in my room?

681
01:01:37.370 --> 01:01:39.289
- I must go.
- Oh, here. It's okay.

682
01:01:39.372 --> 01:01:40.790
- Look, keep it.
- No! No!

683
01:01:40.873 --> 01:01:43.143
I'll never be able to eat it all.
I've got all I could eat.

684
01:01:43.167 --> 01:01:45.837
I'm sorry. All right.

685
01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:47.338
Forget it. Forget it.

686
01:02:19.454 --> 01:02:23.791
And that, I'm sure you'll all remember,
is the voice of the Nelles warbler.

687
01:02:23.875 --> 01:02:25.960
Now let's turn our attention
to this, gentlemen.

688
01:02:26.044 --> 01:02:29.130
The masked shrike.
Lanius nubicus. The butcher-bird.

689
01:02:30.006 --> 01:02:33.468
The shrike impales his foes
on the spikes of thorn bushes.

690
01:02:33.551 --> 01:02:35.720
Not a very lovable character, you see.

691
01:02:35.803 --> 01:02:37.472
Let's have a look at the coloring.

692
01:02:37.555 --> 01:02:40.975
Uniform black above, from head to tail.

693
01:02:41.059 --> 01:02:43.853
A black rump,
a black crown with a bold white flash,

694
01:02:43.936 --> 01:02:46.314
and a white line over the eye.

695
01:02:46.397 --> 01:02:48.524
The shrike lives
in lightly wooded country...

696
01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:53.321
Ah, Hendley. Sit down. You'll find
drawing materials on the table.

697
01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:56.491
The shrike lives
in lightly wooded country,

698
01:02:56.574 --> 01:02:58.242
olive groves and gardens.

699
01:02:58.326 --> 01:03:00.912
Well, Herr Hendley,
have you taken to birds too now?

700
01:03:00.995 --> 01:03:03.581
Yeah. You should stick around.
You might learn something.

701
01:03:03.665 --> 01:03:06.084
I have better things to do
than draw birds.

702
01:03:07.293 --> 01:03:11.214
The voice is a monotonous succession
of scratchy, complaining notes.

703
01:03:12.674 --> 01:03:15.968
Now, let's have a good look at this bird.
He's got a round shape...

704
01:03:37.573 --> 01:03:39.534
- Permission to cross a frontier.
- Good.

705
01:03:39.617 --> 01:03:42.245
Here's another one.
Which one's the forgery?

706
01:03:44.455 --> 01:03:45.540
That one.

707
01:03:45.623 --> 01:03:48.376
- That's right.
- They both are.

708
01:03:49.168 --> 01:03:52.046
What's holding us up now
is the new form of this travel permit.

709
01:03:52.130 --> 01:03:55.049
- We've no idea what they look like.
- Uh, here's one.

710
01:03:56.759 --> 01:03:59.220
And a military identity card.

711
01:04:00.346 --> 01:04:01.806
And a...

712
01:04:01.889 --> 01:04:03.307
- An Ausweis.
- Yeah.

713
01:04:03.391 --> 01:04:05.268
Permission to be on Reich property.

714
01:04:05.351 --> 01:04:07.562
A ticket to Oden.

715
01:04:07.645 --> 01:04:11.482
What appears to be the ferret assignments
by day and hour for the next week.

716
01:04:12.525 --> 01:04:14.819
You get ten out of ten for this, old boy.

717
01:04:14.902 --> 01:04:18.281
- Thank you, sir. Take good care of that.
- Where did you get this?

718
01:04:18.364 --> 01:04:20.658
You - It's on loan.

719
01:04:23.244 --> 01:04:26.080
Now, in order to get
the right amount of outfits, Roger,

720
01:04:26.164 --> 01:04:29.625
I suggest that we work mainly
from service uniforms.

721
01:04:29.709 --> 01:04:33.588
Now, I can do
double-breasteds, single-breasteds,

722
01:04:33.671 --> 01:04:36.591
and, uh, rather nice lounge suits.

723
01:04:36.674 --> 01:04:39.302
Lapels.
I can do quite a lot of things with those.

724
01:04:39.385 --> 01:04:44.140
I can have them deep like that
or high ones like that.

725
01:04:45.433 --> 01:04:48.561
Here's one that, uh,
we're working on right now.

726
01:04:48.644 --> 01:04:50.354
Oh, yes. What about buttons?

727
01:04:52.148 --> 01:04:53.691
Just take a look at those.

728
01:04:54.358 --> 01:04:56.319
Here's one that I've finished, Roger.

729
01:04:59.071 --> 01:05:00.198
And, uh...

730
01:05:01.783 --> 01:05:05.620
here's one that I dyed
with a bottle of blue ink.

731
01:05:06.621 --> 01:05:08.164
Mm, it's rather good.

732
01:05:09.290 --> 01:05:10.458
What's up, Roger?

733
01:05:10.541 --> 01:05:13.419
The goons would have a field day
if they crashed in on this lot.

734
01:05:13.503 --> 01:05:17.673
That's Sorren's department. Now, I've
started working on the other materials.

735
01:05:17.757 --> 01:05:19.926
This, uh - This blanket.

736
01:05:20.009 --> 01:05:22.303
Particularly the stripes. Marvelous.

737
01:05:23.095 --> 01:05:24.514
- Coats.
- Yes.

738
01:05:24.597 --> 01:05:27.183
I've got the chaps working on these
all over the compound.

739
01:05:27.266 --> 01:05:30.520
Oh, those battle dresses -
I'm afraid they're a bit too short.

740
01:05:30.603 --> 01:05:33.981
I'll have to get the chaps to make those
into some sort of workingman's outfits.

741
01:05:35.566 --> 01:05:36.943
Blanket ticking.

742
01:05:37.777 --> 01:05:42.240
Now, I've made these
into rather nice little waistcoats.

743
01:05:42.323 --> 01:05:44.075
Ah, very dapper, yes.

744
01:05:44.158 --> 01:05:46.035
- Dyed, of course.
- Of course.

745
01:05:46.118 --> 01:05:48.120
Uh, just take a look at this, Roger.

746
01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:50.915
Now, this blanket material,

747
01:05:50.998 --> 01:05:54.252
we scrape this down
until it's really smooth

748
01:05:54.335 --> 01:05:56.087
and then dye it with boot polish.

749
01:05:56.671 --> 01:06:00.633
Corduroy scrounged by Hendley.
I wish we had more of this.

750
01:06:00.716 --> 01:06:03.678
- Where in God's name did you get these?
- Hendley.

751
01:06:03.761 --> 01:06:06.180
- Where did he get them?
- I asked him that.

752
01:06:06.264 --> 01:06:08.683
- What did he say?
- "Don't ask."

753
01:06:08.766 --> 01:06:11.769
Let me show you some of the overcoats
I've been working on.

754
01:06:41.424 --> 01:06:42.842
- Hilts.
- Good morning, Hilts.

755
01:06:45.678 --> 01:06:48.848
Well, if you're here to find out
if I'm going out again, I am.

756
01:06:48.931 --> 01:06:51.058
- When?
- Seventeen days. Seventh of July.

757
01:06:51.142 --> 01:06:52.977
- Dark of the moon.
- Correct.

758
01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:54.645
Is Ives going with you?

759
01:06:55.730 --> 01:06:57.023
Yeah, if he wants to.

760
01:06:58.691 --> 01:07:01.736
You, uh - You know that Ives
is close to cracking.

761
01:07:02.987 --> 01:07:04.071
Yeah.

762
01:07:06.157 --> 01:07:08.302
Figure it's better for him
to go out in the tunnel, huh?

763
01:07:08.326 --> 01:07:09.493
Safer.

764
01:07:15.416 --> 01:07:16.459
Right.

765
01:07:18.961 --> 01:07:22.715
Hilts, it's possible for one man to
get out through the wire, even get away,

766
01:07:22.798 --> 01:07:25.176
but, um, there are in fact

767
01:07:25.259 --> 01:07:28.721
a considerable number of people
besides yourself in this camp

768
01:07:28.804 --> 01:07:30.431
who are trying to escape.

769
01:07:31.682 --> 01:07:33.434
I appreciate that.

770
01:07:36.270 --> 01:07:38.189
Something's coming, I can feel it,

771
01:07:38.272 --> 01:07:40.816
and it's coming right around the corner
at me, Squadron Leader.

772
01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:44.153
- Uh, my name's Roger.
- All right, Roger.

773
01:07:44.236 --> 01:07:46.614
Yours is, uh, Virgil, isn't it?

774
01:07:47.949 --> 01:07:50.451
Hilts. Just make it Hilts.

775
01:07:51.869 --> 01:07:56.123
Yes, well, um, as I was saying, Hilts,

776
01:07:56.207 --> 01:08:00.252
um, we have maps of Germany -
general maps, that is.

777
01:08:00.336 --> 01:08:02.630
In fact,
we have all the information that we need

778
01:08:02.713 --> 01:08:04.507
for the escape routes out of Germany.

779
01:08:04.590 --> 01:08:06.676
But, um, what we do not have -.

780
01:08:06.759 --> 01:08:10.346
Is a clear idea of what's 500 yards
beyond those trees.

781
01:08:10.429 --> 01:08:13.391
Right. We've tried every goon
in the camp. No go.

782
01:08:13.474 --> 01:08:16.978
We must know the exact position
of the local town.

783
01:08:17.728 --> 01:08:20.398
We want to know where we hit
the main roads. They must patrol them.

784
01:08:20.481 --> 01:08:23.818
Where the police stations are, where
they've got their military roadblocks.

785
01:08:23.901 --> 01:08:25.736
And most important of all,

786
01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:29.532
we've got to know how to get from here
to the railway station.

787
01:08:31.242 --> 01:08:33.661
No. Absolutely not.

788
01:08:33.744 --> 01:08:35.430
When I get through that wire,
I'm not gonna be

789
01:08:35.454 --> 01:08:37.623
peeking over fences,
making maps for you guys.

790
01:08:37.707 --> 01:08:39.458
By morning I'm gonna be so far away,

791
01:08:39.542 --> 01:08:41.982
you couldn't hear it
if they're shooting at me with howitzers.

792
01:08:42.044 --> 01:08:44.422
That's understandable.

793
01:08:45.256 --> 01:08:46.424
Completely.

794
01:08:48.634 --> 01:08:50.636
I mean, I'd like to help, but...

795
01:08:54.473 --> 01:08:56.017
Interesting idea.

796
01:08:57.101 --> 01:08:58.602
How many you taking out?

797
01:08:58.686 --> 01:09:00.187
Two hundred and fifty.

798
01:09:03.024 --> 01:09:05.401
Two hundred and fifty?

799
01:09:05.484 --> 01:09:06.610
Yeah.

800
01:09:07.820 --> 01:09:09.989
You're crazy.
You oughta be locked up. You too.

801
01:09:10.072 --> 01:09:13.451
Two hundred and fifty guys just
walking down the road, just like that.

802
01:09:13.534 --> 01:09:17.329
Well, some on the road,
some by train, some cross-country.

803
01:09:17.413 --> 01:09:19.832
They'll have forged papers, clothes,

804
01:09:19.915 --> 01:09:21.792
maps, compasses, rations.

805
01:09:21.876 --> 01:09:25.129
Has it occurred to you that you're gonna
alert every goon in the country?

806
01:09:25.212 --> 01:09:28.090
Anybody that can carry a pitchfork
is gonna be out looking for you.

807
01:09:28.174 --> 01:09:32.011
They're gonna swoop down and scoop
you up so fast it'd make your head swim.

808
01:09:35.931 --> 01:09:37.892
Yes, well, uh, thanks anyway.

809
01:09:37.975 --> 01:09:40.352
Anything I can do to help on the tunnel,
let me know.

810
01:09:40.436 --> 01:09:42.521
- That's very good of you.
- Anytime.

811
01:09:44.648 --> 01:09:46.650
Wait a minute!

812
01:09:46.734 --> 01:09:50.237
You aren't seriously suggesting
that if I get through the wire

813
01:09:50.321 --> 01:09:53.240
and case everything out there
and don't get picked up,

814
01:09:53.324 --> 01:09:56.243
to turn myself in and get thrown back
in the cooler for a couple months

815
01:09:56.327 --> 01:09:58.662
so you can get the information you need?

816
01:09:58.746 --> 01:10:00.247
Yes.

817
01:10:00.331 --> 01:10:03.459
One has to ask some very strange things
in the job I have.

818
01:10:03.542 --> 01:10:05.294
We'll give you a front place
in the tunnel.

819
01:10:05.377 --> 01:10:07.647
- I wouldn't do that for my own mother.
- I don't blame you.

820
01:10:07.671 --> 01:10:10.257
- Well, okay, then.
- Well, it's completely understandable.

821
01:10:10.341 --> 01:10:11.550
Well, okay, then.

822
01:10:14.303 --> 01:10:15.805
Yes, well, thanks, Hilts.

823
01:10:23.771 --> 01:10:24.939
Check.

824
01:10:28.651 --> 01:10:30.236
Herr Hendley, I...

825
01:10:30.319 --> 01:10:32.488
Oh, it's all right. Blythe's a friend.

826
01:10:35.991 --> 01:10:37.326
What's the matter, Werner?

827
01:10:37.409 --> 01:10:40.871
My wallet, my papers,
my identity card, gone.

828
01:10:40.955 --> 01:10:42.832
I lost them. Everything.

829
01:10:44.083 --> 01:10:46.043
- He lost his wallet.
- Hmm?

830
01:10:46.127 --> 01:10:49.130
Do you realize what would happen
if Strachwitz found this out?

831
01:10:49.213 --> 01:10:51.549
- Zzzt! The Russian front.
- Dear, dear.

832
01:10:54.552 --> 01:10:56.428
I've looked everyplace, everyplace.

833
01:10:58.472 --> 01:11:01.225
I must have lost them while I was in here.

834
01:11:02.017 --> 01:11:03.477
- No.
- Yes.

835
01:11:04.728 --> 01:11:07.648
Look, I told you we were friends.
We'll find them.

836
01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:10.484
Oh, thank you, Herr Hendley.

837
01:11:12.278 --> 01:11:13.445
Werner.

838
01:11:14.196 --> 01:11:15.739
Not now.

839
01:11:15.823 --> 01:11:17.408
It might look a little peculiar

840
01:11:17.491 --> 01:11:20.202
if you and I were seen
probing around at this time of night.

841
01:11:22.121 --> 01:11:23.873
Look, I'll find them.

842
01:11:23.956 --> 01:11:26.959
I promise you I'll find 'em
if I have to tear this room apart.

843
01:11:33.966 --> 01:11:35.509
- Thank you.
- Forget it.

844
01:11:36.677 --> 01:11:38.304
- Werner...
- Yes?

845
01:11:38.387 --> 01:11:40.264
- There is one small favor.
- Ja?

846
01:11:40.347 --> 01:11:41.599
A camera.

847
01:11:44.685 --> 01:11:47.938
We want to take some snapshots.
You know, keepsakes.

848
01:11:49.398 --> 01:11:53.277
35-millimeter with a 2.8 lens
and a plane shutter.

849
01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:54.945
Focal-plane shutter.

850
01:11:57.740 --> 01:12:00.534
Werner, that's a focal-plane shutter.

851
01:12:02.036 --> 01:12:03.787
Let me know when you got it.

852
01:12:09.084 --> 01:12:12.504
He's a crazy, mixed-up kid, that Werner,
but I like him.

853
01:12:13.631 --> 01:12:14.882
Checkmate.

854
01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:41.825
How soon is our air pump
going to be ready?

855
01:12:41.909 --> 01:12:45.371
- Oh, I'll have it for you tomorrow, Roger.
- You're badly behind schedule.

856
01:12:45.454 --> 01:12:47.915
- How's it coming, Danny?
- No good.

857
01:12:47.998 --> 01:12:50.251
- No good?
- Today, three times -.

858
01:13:08.269 --> 01:13:09.645
Willie, you all right?

859
01:13:09.728 --> 01:13:10.771
Pull!

860
01:13:40.301 --> 01:13:42.845
You're gonna have to shore up
the whole bloody tunnel, Roger.

861
01:13:42.928 --> 01:13:44.805
All 335 feet of it.

862
01:13:45.556 --> 01:13:48.100
Four times today.

863
01:13:48.183 --> 01:13:52.354
This way we never get through.
We must have more wood.

864
01:13:53.647 --> 01:13:56.525
It's a lot of timber, Roger.
Can you get it?

865
01:13:59.737 --> 01:14:00.863
We'll get it.

866
01:14:01.822 --> 01:14:03.073
We've gotta get it.

867
01:14:03.907 --> 01:14:06.785
I'll put Hendley on it,
and the new man we got this morning.

868
01:14:08.537 --> 01:14:10.164
Okay, Willie.

869
01:14:41.403 --> 01:14:44.406
- How's it going with the rafters up there?
- Taking out one in four.

870
01:14:50.371 --> 01:14:51.872
Stay with it.

871
01:15:34.164 --> 01:15:37.501
Bloody singing. I've never worked
so hard in all my life. Hi, Hilts.

872
01:15:37.584 --> 01:15:41.004
Say, Cavendish -

873
01:15:41.088 --> 01:15:44.049
Allez-up!

874
01:15:51.473 --> 01:15:52.766
Never mind.

875
01:16:03.402 --> 01:16:05.487
Here's a present from our friend, Werner.

876
01:16:06.530 --> 01:16:09.908
Splendid. Simply splendid.

877
01:16:11.243 --> 01:16:13.579
This should do very nicely.

878
01:16:16.832 --> 01:16:18.750
Those are Ashley-Pitt's men.

879
01:16:18.834 --> 01:16:22.337
He requested permission to dispose
of some of his dirt in our attic.

880
01:17:31.156 --> 01:17:35.452
Tom has reached just beyond that, uh,
pile of wood, sir, in the Vorlager.

881
01:17:35.536 --> 01:17:37.871
Harry, of course, isn't as far as that.

882
01:17:37.955 --> 01:17:39.873
How much further to the trees?

883
01:17:39.957 --> 01:17:42.000
We make it 50 feet, sir.

884
01:17:42.084 --> 01:17:44.378
- Dark of the moon is the seventh -
- Eighth and ninth.

885
01:17:44.461 --> 01:17:46.964
- Eighth and Ninth. Mm.
- A day earlier in August.

886
01:17:47.047 --> 01:17:48.048
Yes.

887
01:17:53.971 --> 01:17:55.055
Morning.

888
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:57.975
There he goes again.

889
01:17:58.809 --> 01:18:01.270
Why is he buying up
all the potatoes in the camp?

890
01:18:01.353 --> 01:18:04.231
I've been working on that,
but I can't find out.

891
01:18:04.314 --> 01:18:06.984
Hilts and Hendley lock themselves
in their room every night.

892
01:18:07.067 --> 01:18:10.445
Sometimes Goff's in there with them.
Other nights he's on guard outside.

893
01:18:10.529 --> 01:18:14.491
Mac, we'll close down Dick and Harry.
Seal them off.

894
01:18:14.575 --> 01:18:17.661
Put the entire effort into Tom
and press right on into the trees.

895
01:18:17.744 --> 01:18:18.912
Right, Roger.

896
01:19:07.085 --> 01:19:08.086
Wow.

897
01:19:10.547 --> 01:19:11.548
Wow.

898
01:19:12.549 --> 01:19:14.926
Wow.

899
01:19:42.204 --> 01:19:43.330
Wow.

900
01:19:50.462 --> 01:19:51.588
Wow.

901
01:19:59.805 --> 01:20:01.556
Wow.

902
01:20:52.691 --> 01:20:54.067
About face!

903
01:20:55.026 --> 01:20:56.778
Forward march!

904
01:21:04.244 --> 01:21:05.662
What is it?

905
01:21:05.746 --> 01:21:07.539
They're celebrating the revolution.

906
01:21:08.331 --> 01:21:10.083
It's the Fourth of July.

907
01:21:19.593 --> 01:21:21.219
What the devil is this?

908
01:21:24.931 --> 01:21:26.391
And halt!

909
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:29.770
Gentlemen, you're invited for free drinks
at the wash tank.

910
01:21:29.853 --> 01:21:32.123
It's the Fourth of July.
A little present from the colonials.

911
01:21:32.147 --> 01:21:33.648
- Down the British.
- Hear, hear.

912
01:21:33.732 --> 01:21:36.109
- Quite right too.
- And a little drink to Tom.

913
01:21:36.193 --> 01:21:38.445
- And to getting home.
- Thank you.

914
01:21:38.528 --> 01:21:40.113
Very well. We accept.

915
01:21:40.197 --> 01:21:42.073
- Up the rebels!
- Down the British!

916
01:21:42.157 --> 01:21:45.619
Gentlemen, if you'd care to follow us.
About face!

917
01:21:45.702 --> 01:21:47.245
Column, now! March!

918
01:22:05.055 --> 01:22:07.474
- Company, halt!
- Fall out!

919
01:22:11.144 --> 01:22:13.355
All right, let's line up down here!

920
01:22:14.773 --> 01:22:16.316
All right, grab a cup!

921
01:22:17.317 --> 01:22:19.528
Line it up! Here we go.

922
01:22:19.611 --> 01:22:22.489
All right, keep it moving.
Keep it moving, keep it moving.

923
01:22:26.493 --> 01:22:29.120
That explains
what happened to the potatoes.

924
01:22:29.204 --> 01:22:32.040
No harm in closing down Tom
for one day, Roger.

925
01:22:32.123 --> 01:22:35.043
No, I suppose it'll do us all good
to let off a bit of steam.

926
01:22:35.126 --> 01:22:36.753
There's only 14 feet to go, sir,

927
01:22:36.837 --> 01:22:38.964
and you can feel it
throughout the whole bloody camp.

928
01:22:39.047 --> 01:22:41.925
- I think that calls for a drink.
- Hear, hear, sir.

929
01:22:42.008 --> 01:22:44.511
- Drink it up.
- What is this stuff, Hilts?

930
01:22:44.594 --> 01:22:47.722
Moonshine. American moonshine. Moonshine.

931
01:22:47.806 --> 01:22:51.935
- Make my mustache grow. Cheers.
- Here we go. Keep it moving, now.

932
01:22:52.018 --> 01:22:55.397
Keep it go -
Hello, Eric. Don't spill any of that.

933
01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:57.649
- There you go.
- Hello, Eric. Down with the British.

934
01:22:57.732 --> 01:23:01.111
All right, old cobber. Keep it mo - Whoop!

935
01:23:01.194 --> 01:23:03.446
Yeah. Don't get any on your clothes.

936
01:23:03.530 --> 01:23:05.824
- Cheers!
- Don't get any on your clothes.

937
01:23:05.907 --> 01:23:08.660
- Don't spill any of that.
- Before your morning tea?

938
01:23:08.743 --> 01:23:11.329
- Have you any tonic water?
- Here, keep it moving.

939
01:23:11.413 --> 01:23:13.623
Don't get any on your clothes, sir.

940
01:23:13.707 --> 01:23:16.501
American moonshine.
Don't smoke right after you drink it.

941
01:23:17.502 --> 01:23:20.171
No smoking.
No smoking while you're drinking.

942
01:23:28.930 --> 01:23:30.223
Cheerio!

943
01:23:35.186 --> 01:23:37.147
Get good and stoned, my friend.

944
01:23:39.691 --> 01:23:41.818
Keep it going. Keep it...

945
01:23:42.861 --> 01:23:45.572
No taxation without representation.

946
01:23:46.239 --> 01:23:48.325
Keep it going, boys. Keep it...

947
01:23:50.201 --> 01:23:52.412
Keep it going, fellas. Enjoy yourselves.

948
01:23:53.079 --> 01:23:55.206
Well, let's drink to Tom.

949
01:23:55.290 --> 01:23:56.333
To Tom.

950
01:24:00.879 --> 01:24:02.964
Oi!

951
01:24:04.215 --> 01:24:05.717
In the three years, seven months

952
01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:08.595
and approximately two weeks
that I've been in the bag,

953
01:24:08.678 --> 01:24:11.056
that's the most extraordinary stuff
I've ever tasted.

954
01:24:11.723 --> 01:24:13.683
Oh, it's shattering!

955
01:24:13.767 --> 01:24:15.769
Well, I think it's rather good.

956
01:24:17.938 --> 01:24:21.524
Well, with your permission, sir,
I think I'll "all on Kive" -.

957
01:24:21.608 --> 01:24:24.110
Call on Ives.

958
01:24:34.204 --> 01:24:35.914
- Cheers, Hendley!
- Hendley!

959
01:24:35.997 --> 01:24:37.123
Cheers!

960
01:24:44.673 --> 01:24:46.132
You know what that is?

961
01:24:46.675 --> 01:24:48.301
I'll tell you what it isn't.

962
01:24:49.010 --> 01:24:50.929
It isn't Napoleon brandy.

963
01:24:53.139 --> 01:24:54.641
How do you like it, sir?

964
01:24:55.809 --> 01:24:57.894
Well, it's, um...

965
01:24:57.978 --> 01:24:59.813
To the colonies.

966
01:24:59.896 --> 01:25:01.439
Independence.

967
01:25:07.612 --> 01:25:10.115
How are you managing over there
without us?

968
01:25:10.198 --> 01:25:11.741
Getting along all right, are you?

969
01:25:11.825 --> 01:25:14.744
We seem to be getting along all right,
shir - sir.

970
01:25:23.336 --> 01:25:24.879
Yes, well, it's, uh...

971
01:25:26.881 --> 01:25:28.717
It's good stuff, Hilts.

972
01:25:31.344 --> 01:25:32.721
Thank you, sir.

973
01:25:53.616 --> 01:25:55.493
Danny? Here's to...

974
01:26:03.001 --> 01:26:05.503
Roger, goons in 105.

975
01:26:06.421 --> 01:26:08.214
- Who?
- Strachwitz.

976
01:26:11.509 --> 01:26:15.513
We have to ignore it. If we pay attention,
the goons will know the hut's important.

977
01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:19.142
Here's to going home.

978
01:26:34.365 --> 01:26:37.827
Come on, Danny.
They've searched it a hundred times.

979
01:26:37.911 --> 01:26:39.162
Home.

980
01:26:52.300 --> 01:26:54.695
Anyway, I'm glad we've got you
in the tunnel with us, Piglet.

981
01:26:54.719 --> 01:26:56.429
- Aye.
- To Tom, eh?

982
01:26:59.057 --> 01:27:03.144
Och, never mind. You'll be walking down
Argyle Street in a couple of weeks, man.

983
01:27:03.228 --> 01:27:04.813
To Tom.

984
01:27:04.896 --> 01:27:07.982
You know, Sandy,
I'm just beginning to realize that myself.

985
01:27:08.066 --> 01:27:11.111
Why shouldn't you, man?
We're nearly at the trees, boy.

986
01:27:11.194 --> 01:27:13.154
We're nearly at the trees, eh?

987
01:28:00.535 --> 01:28:02.287
Herr Hauptfeldwebel! Herr Hauptfeldwebel!

988
01:28:03.163 --> 01:28:04.247
Herr Hauptfeldwebel!

989
01:28:43.661 --> 01:28:45.496
Oh, my God, they've found Tom!

990
01:28:59.427 --> 01:29:00.762
It's the tunnel.

991
01:29:18.529 --> 01:29:20.156
Success.

992
01:29:44.430 --> 01:29:46.224
- Ives!
- Halt!

993
01:29:46.307 --> 01:29:48.559
- Ives! Ives!
- Halt! Halt!

994
01:29:48.643 --> 01:29:49.644
Halt!

995
01:30:56.836 --> 01:30:57.962
Sir...

996
01:30:59.088 --> 01:31:01.132
let me know
the exact information you need.

997
01:31:02.050 --> 01:31:04.135
- I'm going out tonight.
- Right.

998
01:31:06.804 --> 01:31:08.264
Open up Harry.

999
01:31:08.931 --> 01:31:11.476
We dig. Around the clock.

1000
01:32:49.615 --> 01:32:50.741
Cooler.

1001
01:32:51.367 --> 01:32:52.410
Right.

1002
01:32:55.455 --> 01:32:58.332
Well,
I didn't think they'd catch him so soon.

1003
01:33:00.001 --> 01:33:01.419
He wasn't caught.

1004
01:33:15.766 --> 01:33:17.685
Hilts, welcome home.

1005
01:34:10.905 --> 01:34:11.906
Danny?

1006
01:34:14.492 --> 01:34:15.535
Danny?

1007
01:34:19.205 --> 01:34:20.248
Danny?

1008
01:34:27.797 --> 01:34:29.298
Are you all right, Danny?

1009
01:34:31.592 --> 01:34:32.593
Yes.

1010
01:34:33.761 --> 01:34:34.804
All right.

1011
01:34:37.848 --> 01:34:40.643
All right.
Bring some shovels. I'm all right.

1012
01:34:43.521 --> 01:34:46.148
For God's sake, Smithy,
you've left out a whole bloody eagle.

1013
01:34:46.232 --> 01:34:47.608
That's impossible.

1014
01:34:49.193 --> 01:34:50.236
Yes.

1015
01:34:51.946 --> 01:34:54.156
Four days' work up the bloody spout!

1016
01:34:55.992 --> 01:34:57.702
I'm sorry, Colin.

1017
01:34:58.411 --> 01:34:59.954
It's all right, Smithy.

1018
01:35:01.455 --> 01:35:02.999
It's getting late.

1019
01:35:03.082 --> 01:35:05.251
You push off to bed. I'll pack up here.

1020
01:35:05.334 --> 01:35:06.502
Right.

1021
01:35:07.378 --> 01:35:08.838
Good night, Colin.

1022
01:35:08.921 --> 01:35:10.172
Good night, Smithy.

1023
01:35:50.421 --> 01:35:52.173
I can't see a bloody thing.

1024
01:36:09.649 --> 01:36:10.858
Heil Hitler.

1025
01:36:21.118 --> 01:36:24.038
- Your German's very good.
- Thanks, Mac. I've put in a lot of...

1026
01:36:24.664 --> 01:36:26.207
Oh, now, watch it, Haynes.

1027
01:36:26.290 --> 01:36:29.502
That's the easiest way to trip up
a suspect. Don't fall for that old gag.

1028
01:36:29.585 --> 01:36:31.796
- Sorry, Mac.
- Okay. But remember: German always.

1029
01:36:31.879 --> 01:36:33.422
- Right-o.
- All right?

1030
01:36:45.476 --> 01:36:49.438
One, two, three, four, five.

1031
01:37:07.123 --> 01:37:09.792
Roger?

1032
01:37:14.922 --> 01:37:16.424
No, it's me.

1033
01:37:19.135 --> 01:37:21.220
How do you like the old escape suit?

1034
01:37:21.303 --> 01:37:22.680
Fine, fine.

1035
01:37:25.558 --> 01:37:26.684
Colin...

1036
01:37:29.770 --> 01:37:31.355
how do you like mine?

1037
01:37:32.231 --> 01:37:33.733
It looks splendid.

1038
01:38:00.843 --> 01:38:03.304
Danny, where are you going?
You'll get yourself shot.

1039
01:38:03.387 --> 01:38:06.599
- What's the matter with you?
- I'm going out through that fence.

1040
01:38:09.101 --> 01:38:12.813
Danny, we're getting out
through the tunnel. We're almost clear.

1041
01:38:12.897 --> 01:38:15.065
Please, Willie, let me alone.

1042
01:38:15.733 --> 01:38:17.860
I can't go in that tunnel anymore.

1043
01:38:18.569 --> 01:38:20.654
So I'm going out through the wire.

1044
01:38:24.575 --> 01:38:26.243
Danny, think.

1045
01:38:26.327 --> 01:38:28.454
We're getting out,
but not through the wire.

1046
01:38:28.537 --> 01:38:30.998
We're getting out through the tunnel.
It's finished.

1047
01:38:31.624 --> 01:38:33.334
- I go out now.
- No.

1048
01:38:34.835 --> 01:38:37.838
Danny, you go through that wire,
and you'll get killed.

1049
01:38:45.554 --> 01:38:46.847
Don't do that.

1050
01:38:49.475 --> 01:38:50.643
Willie...

1051
01:38:53.354 --> 01:38:54.939
since I was a boy,

1052
01:38:55.648 --> 01:39:00.152
I hated and feared little rooms,

1053
01:39:00.236 --> 01:39:02.363
closets, caves.

1054
01:39:02.446 --> 01:39:04.949
Danny, you've dug 17 tunnels.
Over 17 tunnels.

1055
01:39:05.032 --> 01:39:07.076
Because I must get out.

1056
01:39:07.576 --> 01:39:10.287
I hide the fear, and I dig.

1057
01:39:11.705 --> 01:39:15.167
But tomorrow night,
in the tunnel with all those men,

1058
01:39:15.918 --> 01:39:18.587
I'm afraid maybe this time
I will lose my head

1059
01:39:18.671 --> 01:39:20.714
and ruin the escape for everybody.

1060
01:39:24.134 --> 01:39:25.386
So I go now.

1061
01:39:30.891 --> 01:39:33.477
Danny, I'll see you through the tunnel.

1062
01:39:35.354 --> 01:39:38.107
I'll look after you.
I'll stick with you all the way.

1063
01:39:39.733 --> 01:39:40.943
All right.

1064
01:39:50.411 --> 01:39:52.454
- Good evening.
- Hello, Roger.

1065
01:39:53.163 --> 01:39:55.833
Well, how do you think we look?

1066
01:39:59.420 --> 01:40:01.213
It's as bad as all that?

1067
01:40:01.297 --> 01:40:05.426
Colin, I - I want first of all to say
that without you,

1068
01:40:06.135 --> 01:40:07.887
we would not have been ready.

1069
01:40:07.970 --> 01:40:11.515
Oh, that's all right. I had lots of help.
Lots of very good help.

1070
01:40:13.475 --> 01:40:15.019
What's the matter, Roger?

1071
01:40:16.395 --> 01:40:17.646
You can't go.

1072
01:40:19.273 --> 01:40:21.150
- What do you mean?
- I can't allow it.

1073
01:40:21.233 --> 01:40:22.234
Why?

1074
01:40:22.318 --> 01:40:25.404
Because you can't see your hand
in front of your face.

1075
01:40:25.487 --> 01:40:27.281
You'd be caught before you got ten yards.

1076
01:40:28.157 --> 01:40:29.617
That's ridiculous.

1077
01:40:31.201 --> 01:40:32.828
That's ridiculous.

1078
01:40:32.912 --> 01:40:36.123
Never heard anything so absurd in my life.
I can see perfectly.

1079
01:40:36.790 --> 01:40:38.292
I can see perfectly!

1080
01:40:38.918 --> 01:40:42.338
I can see... that pin down there.

1081
01:40:42.421 --> 01:40:44.506
- Does that satisfy you?
- What pin? Where?

1082
01:40:56.810 --> 01:40:59.939
Colin, do you, uh,
see the foot of the door?

1083
01:41:01.315 --> 01:41:02.483
Yes, of course.

1084
01:41:04.777 --> 01:41:06.487
Put the pin down there, will you?

1085
01:41:08.030 --> 01:41:09.323
All right.

1086
01:41:14.078 --> 01:41:15.204
All right. Come on.

1087
01:41:16.413 --> 01:41:17.915
Come on, sit down.

1088
01:41:19.959 --> 01:41:22.419
Sit down. It was a good try.

1089
01:41:24.004 --> 01:41:27.216
I hate these last-minute letdowns,
but I've only just been told.

1090
01:41:27.883 --> 01:41:31.178
- It's too risky for you.
- Don't you think that's Colin's decision?

1091
01:41:31.804 --> 01:41:33.889
- No, I don't.
- Come on, Roger.

1092
01:41:33.973 --> 01:41:36.266
We all know the score here.

1093
01:41:36.350 --> 01:41:39.520
Well, at least most of us do.

1094
01:41:39.603 --> 01:41:43.023
Your idea of this escape
is to start another front,

1095
01:41:43.107 --> 01:41:44.984
to foul up the Germans behind the lines.

1096
01:41:45.067 --> 01:41:47.277
All right, that's fine, that's fine.

1097
01:41:47.361 --> 01:41:50.030
But once we get past that barbed wire,
once we have them looking

1098
01:41:50.114 --> 01:41:52.074
all over Germany for us,

1099
01:41:52.157 --> 01:41:53.701
that mission is accomplished.

1100
01:41:54.410 --> 01:41:57.538
Afterwards, we have some ideas of our own.

1101
01:41:58.914 --> 01:42:00.791
You mean getting home?

1102
01:42:00.874 --> 01:42:03.127
- Back to your family and children?
- That's right.

1103
01:42:03.210 --> 01:42:06.714
Good God, man. Do you really believe
I haven't thought about that too?

1104
01:42:06.797 --> 01:42:08.298
I'm sure you have.

1105
01:42:10.009 --> 01:42:11.593
I know Colin has.

1106
01:42:13.053 --> 01:42:17.224
And, Roger, I have too.
We think we can make it all the way.

1107
01:42:17.307 --> 01:42:18.767
Not Colin.

1108
01:42:18.851 --> 01:42:21.979
He'd be an appalling hazard to the escape.
That must be my decision.

1109
01:42:22.062 --> 01:42:25.566
You want to talk about hazard,
let's talk about you.

1110
01:42:26.525 --> 01:42:29.945
You're the biggest hazard we have.
The Gestapo has you marked.

1111
01:42:32.197 --> 01:42:33.949
No one has said you can't go.

1112
01:42:35.909 --> 01:42:37.327
That's true.

1113
01:42:38.537 --> 01:42:40.539
And I have thought about the Gestapo.

1114
01:42:42.958 --> 01:42:47.004
But if you're asking me how far
a commanding officer is allowed to go,

1115
01:42:47.087 --> 01:42:48.338
or dare go...

1116
01:42:50.007 --> 01:42:52.134
or should be permitted to play God...

1117
01:42:53.927 --> 01:42:55.429
I can't answer you.

1118
01:42:57.139 --> 01:42:58.766
But I can tell you,

1119
01:42:59.433 --> 01:43:03.228
a blind man is an unnecessary hazard
not only to himself but the whole plan

1120
01:43:03.312 --> 01:43:06.023
and must therefore be eliminated
from the operation.

1121
01:43:17.409 --> 01:43:20.412
Colin's not a blind man
as long as he's with me,

1122
01:43:20.496 --> 01:43:22.247
and he's going with me.

1123
01:43:28.545 --> 01:43:30.297
It's all right with you, Colin?

1124
01:43:33.008 --> 01:43:35.594
Oh, yes. Quite.

1125
01:43:43.143 --> 01:43:44.353
Very well.

1126
01:43:45.187 --> 01:43:48.065
I'll arrange for your escape numbers
to be altered accordingly.

1127
01:43:49.817 --> 01:43:51.401
Good night, gentlemen.

1128
01:43:58.700 --> 01:43:59.952
Actually...

1129
01:44:01.787 --> 01:44:03.330
he's quite right.

1130
01:44:04.081 --> 01:44:05.666
He's completely right.

1131
01:44:06.667 --> 01:44:08.752
I really shouldn't go at all.

1132
01:44:08.836 --> 01:44:12.297
My eyes have been getting
worse and worse lately.

1133
01:44:12.381 --> 01:44:15.092
I think they call it progressive myopia.

1134
01:44:16.510 --> 01:44:21.181
I can see things up here, close to.
I can see to work.

1135
01:44:21.265 --> 01:44:22.558
But, uh...

1136
01:44:24.810 --> 01:44:25.936
you're just a blur.

1137
01:44:27.354 --> 01:44:28.480
I know.

1138
01:44:30.232 --> 01:44:32.776
Oh, hell. We'll make it in great shape.

1139
01:44:32.860 --> 01:44:34.444
Colin, do you have any tea?

1140
01:44:36.155 --> 01:44:38.532
- Yes, of course.
- Then let's have some.

1141
01:44:40.492 --> 01:44:41.827
Splendid.

1142
01:45:00.804 --> 01:45:01.805
Aus.

1143
01:45:28.081 --> 01:45:29.208
Hi, Hilts.

1144
01:45:30.375 --> 01:45:31.501
Hey, Mac.

1145
01:45:34.588 --> 01:45:35.589
When?

1146
01:45:36.340 --> 01:45:38.800
Tonight.
We thought they'd never let you out.

1147
01:45:38.884 --> 01:45:40.969
Me too. Let's get at it.

1148
01:45:41.595 --> 01:45:43.680
- Bartlett's waiting for you.
- I'll be there.

1149
01:46:55.460 --> 01:46:56.461
What time?

1150
01:46:59.131 --> 01:47:00.757
Only eight minutes now, Danny.

1151
01:47:04.928 --> 01:47:05.929
You okay?

1152
01:47:17.357 --> 01:47:18.483
Cavendish.

1153
01:47:19.443 --> 01:47:22.404
Griff, down there. Goff, there.

1154
01:47:42.841 --> 01:47:45.594
Smith, Foles, third on the right.

1155
01:47:46.803 --> 01:47:49.598
Blythe, Hendley, third on the left.

1156
01:48:18.335 --> 01:48:20.796
There are the lights.

1157
01:48:22.214 --> 01:48:23.965
Right on the tick, Danny.

1158
01:48:34.601 --> 01:48:36.728
Look down the tunnel, Danny.

1159
01:48:36.812 --> 01:48:38.730
It's lovely.

1160
01:48:40.232 --> 01:48:43.402
It's just like Blackpool
at the height of the season.

1161
01:48:45.404 --> 01:48:47.239
You ever been to Blackpool, Danny?

1162
01:48:48.198 --> 01:48:49.199
Yes.

1163
01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:51.201
No.

1164
01:48:52.911 --> 01:48:54.121
I don't know.

1165
01:48:57.958 --> 01:48:58.959
It's time, Roger.

1166
01:49:12.639 --> 01:49:15.725
Bartlett, MacDonald, Ashley-Pitt.

1167
01:49:19.688 --> 01:49:20.939
It's all clear, sir.

1168
01:49:29.823 --> 01:49:31.533
We're all set, Roger.

1169
01:49:44.671 --> 01:49:45.714
Roger.

1170
01:49:46.465 --> 01:49:47.549
Good luck.

1171
01:50:19.206 --> 01:50:21.082
They're coming down the shaft now, Danny.

1172
01:50:21.917 --> 01:50:24.169
And then they'll be coming
right up the tunnel.

1173
01:50:31.384 --> 01:50:32.427
Willie...

1174
01:50:33.637 --> 01:50:36.515
I can't wait till it's over.
I must get out.

1175
01:50:37.265 --> 01:50:39.059
Danny! Danny! Danny!

1176
01:50:40.143 --> 01:50:41.394
Danny!

1177
01:51:08.755 --> 01:51:10.632
What is it, Danny? What's the matter?

1178
01:51:10.715 --> 01:51:12.217
- I must -
- Danny! Come here!

1179
01:51:12.884 --> 01:51:16.054
Roger? Roger, Danny and I'll go later.
We'll take another place.

1180
01:51:16.137 --> 01:51:18.431
Danny, tell me what this is,
and tell me quickly!

1181
01:51:19.099 --> 01:51:23.270
This tunnel is mine as much as anybody.
I dug it. I built it.

1182
01:51:23.353 --> 01:51:25.647
I was buried many times. I go when I want.

1183
01:51:25.730 --> 01:51:27.607
Let me out. Let me out.

1184
01:51:30.777 --> 01:51:32.028
Take him out, Willie.

1185
01:51:32.112 --> 01:51:33.530
- Roger -
- Take him out.

1186
01:51:48.128 --> 01:51:49.671
Danny? What is it?

1187
01:51:50.630 --> 01:51:52.799
Danny, what's going on?

1188
01:51:52.882 --> 01:51:55.969
It's all right, Sedgwick. It's all right.
We're going later.

1189
01:52:02.726 --> 01:52:05.270
Danny - Danny, it's all right.
It's all right.

1190
01:52:05.353 --> 01:52:08.607
We can take another place in the line.
It's all right.

1191
01:52:10.150 --> 01:52:11.943
All right, Colin. Down you go.

1192
01:52:12.819 --> 01:52:15.947
Sit down. Feel the top rung of the ladder
with your right foot.

1193
01:52:16.031 --> 01:52:17.532
Got it? Huh?

1194
01:52:17.616 --> 01:52:18.783
Down you go.

1195
01:52:34.799 --> 01:52:36.259
Danny cut out, huh?

1196
01:52:37.010 --> 01:52:39.721
Willie took him up top. Hilts, I, uh...

1197
01:52:52.567 --> 01:52:55.236
- Remember, keep your head down.
- Right.

1198
01:53:12.671 --> 01:53:13.797
Right.

1199
01:53:20.720 --> 01:53:22.263
Psst! Bartlett!

1200
01:54:01.511 --> 01:54:02.637
All right?

1201
01:54:03.847 --> 01:54:06.182
Hold on to yourself, Bartlett.
You're 20 feet short.

1202
01:54:06.266 --> 01:54:09.310
- What do you mean, 20 feet short?
- You're 20 feet short of the woods.

1203
01:54:09.394 --> 01:54:13.106
The hole is in right here in the open.
The guard is between us and the lights.

1204
01:54:13.189 --> 01:54:15.275
How could that happen? The survey -.

1205
01:54:15.358 --> 01:54:17.610
What the hell difference does it make?
It's happened.

1206
01:54:32.751 --> 01:54:35.003
- Roger -
- Damn it, Mac! I'm trying to think!

1207
01:54:36.546 --> 01:54:38.548
We could postpone it
till we dig to the trees.

1208
01:54:38.631 --> 01:54:41.176
All the documents are dated today.
It's now or never.

1209
01:54:45.972 --> 01:54:47.807
One chance.

1210
01:54:47.891 --> 01:54:51.060
When the guard goes to the far end,
you might be able to move your men out.

1211
01:54:51.144 --> 01:54:54.731
I think I can make it to the woods,
set up a signal when you're clear.

1212
01:54:54.814 --> 01:54:57.525
- What about the goon towers?
- A chance you're gonna have to take.

1213
01:54:57.609 --> 01:54:59.944
But they're gonna be watching
the compound, not the woods.

1214
01:55:04.115 --> 01:55:06.409
Mac, pass the word.
Send down 30 feet of rope.

1215
01:55:07.494 --> 01:55:09.537
Send down 30 feet of rope!

1216
01:55:10.955 --> 01:55:13.291
Send down 30 feet of rope.

1217
01:55:15.418 --> 01:55:17.045
Send down 30 feet of rope!

1218
01:55:17.128 --> 01:55:19.047
- What?
- Thirty feet of rope!

1219
01:55:19.130 --> 01:55:22.050
- What do they want that for?
- How should I know? Get the rope.

1220
01:55:37.440 --> 01:55:39.484
How's it going, Tommy? Have you heard?

1221
01:55:39.567 --> 01:55:41.569
Some kind of foul-up, I think, sir.

1222
01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:45.323
- Haven't they moved into the tunnel yet?
- I don't think so, sir.

1223
01:56:08.888 --> 01:56:10.265
He's over there.

1224
01:56:16.813 --> 01:56:19.065
Right. You go first, Eric.

1225
01:56:20.066 --> 01:56:22.235
- I'm staying here till we get moving.
- Right.

1226
01:56:33.580 --> 01:56:35.999
- See you in Piccadilly.
- Scott's Bar.

1227
01:56:36.082 --> 01:56:37.417
Right.

1228
01:56:50.513 --> 01:56:52.515
Thank you. Good luck.

1229
01:56:52.599 --> 01:56:53.600
Right.

1230
01:57:18.875 --> 01:57:20.084
We're moving.

1231
01:57:27.050 --> 01:57:30.511
Danny, they're moving through
the tunnel now. They're getting out.

1232
01:57:34.223 --> 01:57:36.434
Danny, when Warsaw fell,

1233
01:57:36.517 --> 01:57:39.145
you escaped and came to England
because you're a flyer.

1234
01:57:39.812 --> 01:57:43.066
You came because you wanted to fly
with us and fight the Germans.

1235
01:57:44.233 --> 01:57:47.320
We can get out now.
We can get back to England.

1236
01:57:49.197 --> 01:57:51.491
Danny,
if you don't go through that tunnel,

1237
01:57:51.574 --> 01:57:53.743
everything you've done
will have been for nothing.

1238
01:57:53.826 --> 01:57:54.994
Nothing!

1239
01:58:23.898 --> 01:58:25.775
- Blythe's behind, Mac.
- Right.

1240
01:58:28.444 --> 01:58:30.238
In here, Colin. Come on.

1241
01:58:30.947 --> 01:58:32.073
Sit down.

1242
01:58:37.704 --> 01:58:39.580
You're up, Sedgwick. I'll take over.

1243
01:58:43.668 --> 01:58:46.921
- What have you got in here? A piano?
- That's very funny, mate.

1244
01:58:47.005 --> 01:58:49.173
Sedgwick,
you won't get this thing through.

1245
01:58:49.257 --> 01:58:50.299
I'll cope.

1246
01:58:53.553 --> 01:58:55.888
Was that Sedgwick with his steamer trunk?

1247
01:58:55.972 --> 01:58:58.683
- Who else?
- I wish he was home with his kangaroos.

1248
01:59:05.857 --> 01:59:07.650
- We're 20 feet short.
- How the hell -.

1249
01:59:07.734 --> 01:59:11.571
We're 20 feet short. Hilts is on
the other end of that rope in the woods.

1250
01:59:11.654 --> 01:59:13.574
As soon as you feel a couple of tugs,
off you go,

1251
01:59:13.656 --> 01:59:16.159
- but keep Colin low on the way across.
- Right.

1252
01:59:17.535 --> 01:59:19.162
- Good luck, Colin.
- Thanks, Mac.

1253
01:59:29.213 --> 01:59:30.214
What's that?

1254
01:59:32.300 --> 01:59:35.261
- It's an air raid.
- Oh, God, no!

1255
01:59:35.344 --> 01:59:38.639
The goons'll pull the switches,
and we'll lose the lights in the tunnel.

1256
01:59:38.723 --> 01:59:41.893
Come on, Colin. We can get out
when the lights go down.

1257
01:59:54.781 --> 01:59:55.782
Willie.

1258
01:59:56.699 --> 01:59:57.700
Willie!

1259
02:00:00.036 --> 02:00:02.288
It's an air raid.
Searchlights are out. Come on!

1260
02:00:09.337 --> 02:00:10.546
Get 'em out.

1261
02:00:16.636 --> 02:00:18.721
- It's gonna give!
- Danny.

1262
02:00:18.805 --> 02:00:21.057
- It's gonna cave!
- Danny. Danny, it's all right.

1263
02:00:21.140 --> 02:00:22.850
Danny, there's the lights.

1264
02:00:24.060 --> 02:00:26.604
Light the fat lamps down there!

1265
02:00:27.939 --> 02:00:30.650
There's been an air raid,
and they've cut the lights, Danny.

1266
02:00:30.733 --> 02:00:33.694
Danny, the tunnel, it's all right.
Listen to me!

1267
02:00:35.154 --> 02:00:36.989
Danny, look. Here.

1268
02:00:40.159 --> 02:00:44.789
Come on, fellas. Move! Move!
We can get dozens out in this darkness.

1269
02:00:52.213 --> 02:00:53.756
What the hell's going on?

1270
02:00:53.840 --> 02:00:55.216
You go.

1271
02:00:56.008 --> 02:00:58.719
No, Danny - Danny -.

1272
02:00:58.803 --> 02:01:00.221
Go.

1273
02:01:08.146 --> 02:01:10.439
- What is this, Willie?
- I brought Danny there.

1274
02:01:10.523 --> 02:01:12.733
- Is he stuck in there?
- No, he's all right.

1275
02:01:12.817 --> 02:01:14.569
Get him out fast.

1276
02:01:16.946 --> 02:01:18.364
Psst! Come on!

1277
02:01:21.701 --> 02:01:23.161
Come on, Danny, move.

1278
02:01:40.011 --> 02:01:41.137
Up you go.

1279
02:01:47.852 --> 02:01:49.270
Give me your bag.

1280
02:01:56.194 --> 02:01:57.737
We're on the rope!

1281
02:02:43.449 --> 02:02:47.453
You and I had better get out, or we won't
have a chance of any of the trains.

1282
02:02:47.536 --> 02:02:50.414
It's moving. We'll just have to pass
the instructions from man to man.

1283
02:02:52.541 --> 02:02:54.126
- Right.
- I'll be right behind you.

1284
02:03:40.881 --> 02:03:43.134
Come on, come on.

1285
02:04:02.111 --> 02:04:03.112
Come on.

1286
02:04:21.881 --> 02:04:23.257
- Hey!
- Don't shoot!

1287
02:04:24.800 --> 02:04:26.052
Don't shoot!

1288
02:04:26.135 --> 02:04:27.553
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1289
02:04:27.636 --> 02:04:30.097
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1290
02:04:33.017 --> 02:04:34.935
Get off! We're coming back!

1291
02:04:58.376 --> 02:05:01.670
Oh, boy. There's a hell of a lot
of shooting going on up there.

1292
02:05:01.754 --> 02:05:04.006
Think they've been shooting them
as they came out?

1293
02:05:04.090 --> 02:05:06.384
No, couldn't be.
We would've heard the shots before.

1294
02:05:09.470 --> 02:05:10.596
Pull!

1295
02:05:10.679 --> 02:05:12.807
- Wait for me.
- Away!

1296
02:05:18.020 --> 02:05:19.063
Out.

1297
02:05:40.835 --> 02:05:41.836
Out.

1298
02:06:16.370 --> 02:06:18.706
- How many did he say?
- Seventy-six.

1299
02:06:18.789 --> 02:06:20.124
Seventy-six.

1300
02:06:20.207 --> 02:06:21.667
- Seventy-six.
- Seventy-six.

1301
02:06:34.847 --> 02:06:36.515
Dismissed.

1302
02:06:37.099 --> 02:06:38.517
A-ten hut!

1303
02:07:35.241 --> 02:07:38.494
Half the guys who missed their trains
are piled up in this station.

1304
02:07:38.577 --> 02:07:41.789
Ashley-Pitt, Roger, MacDonald, Nimmo.

1305
02:07:41.872 --> 02:07:43.749
Makes quite a group.

1306
02:07:43.832 --> 02:07:45.125
What do we do?

1307
02:07:45.960 --> 02:07:47.294
Wait for the train.

1308
02:11:56.084 --> 02:11:57.294
Danke schön.

1309
02:13:52.367 --> 02:13:53.535
Tally-ho.

1310
02:14:28.111 --> 02:14:29.738
- Merci.
- Merci bien.

1311
02:14:37.287 --> 02:14:38.497
Tally-ho.

1312
02:14:58.809 --> 02:15:00.644
- Danke.
- Danke.

1313
02:15:11.947 --> 02:15:13.407
Are the police on the train?

1314
02:15:13.490 --> 02:15:15.909
Yes. The Gestapo are with them.
We're gonna jump.

1315
02:15:15.993 --> 02:15:17.160
All right.

1316
02:15:22.749 --> 02:15:24.001
I'll tell you when.

1317
02:15:24.084 --> 02:15:26.837
I'd prefer you just to give me
a good, firm push.

1318
02:15:46.273 --> 02:15:48.734
- Are you all right?
- Yes. I'm fine.

1319
02:15:49.526 --> 02:15:51.236
That was quite exciting.

1320
02:15:53.113 --> 02:15:54.322
It isn't stopping.

1321
02:15:55.240 --> 02:15:56.783
No, we're all right.

1322
02:16:52.172 --> 02:16:53.465
Switzerland.

1323
02:17:27.124 --> 02:17:29.209
Hey!

1324
02:17:42.722 --> 02:17:44.766
Hey! Halt! Halt!

1325
02:21:36.373 --> 02:21:37.374
Bartlett.

1326
02:22:36.933 --> 02:22:38.810
Where were you going, Cavendish?

1327
02:22:38.893 --> 02:22:41.813
I, uh - I hadn't quite decided.

1328
02:22:41.896 --> 02:22:44.774
What information were you to collect
on the way?

1329
02:22:44.858 --> 02:22:45.859
None.

1330
02:22:45.942 --> 02:22:48.319
What sabotage directions did you receive?

1331
02:22:48.403 --> 02:22:50.738
What have you done with your papers?

1332
02:22:52.615 --> 02:22:56.119
- Papers?
- Forged papers and identity cards.

1333
02:22:56.202 --> 02:22:59.330
Don't be so stupid.
What did you do with them?

1334
02:22:59.414 --> 02:23:01.749
All I did was to escape
from a prison camp.

1335
02:23:01.833 --> 02:23:04.711
You'd do the same
if you'd been locked up for three years.

1336
02:23:05.503 --> 02:23:06.754
I wanted to get home.

1337
02:23:06.838 --> 02:23:09.966
I don't think you'll ever see
your wife and children again.

1338
02:23:10.049 --> 02:23:12.385
You've obviously got the wrong man.
I'm not even married.

1339
02:23:12.469 --> 02:23:14.262
You're wearing civilian clothes.

1340
02:23:16.139 --> 02:23:19.100
You're a spy. Spies are being shot.

1341
02:23:19.767 --> 02:23:23.688
This is my uniform.
I had to recut it when I lost weight.

1342
02:23:25.315 --> 02:23:27.901
I dyed it with some boot polish
to cover some oil smears

1343
02:23:27.984 --> 02:23:29.986
I picked up when I was shot down.

1344
02:23:41.039 --> 02:23:43.374
And you lost your insignia over the years?

1345
02:23:44.042 --> 02:23:45.210
That's right.

1346
02:23:51.132 --> 02:23:53.134
- Look -
- That's all, Cavendish.

1347
02:24:18.243 --> 02:24:19.536
Hello, boys.

1348
02:24:24.207 --> 02:24:25.500
Hello, David.

1349
02:24:28.461 --> 02:24:30.463
- Hello, Haynes.
- Hello, Cavendish.

1350
02:24:32.257 --> 02:24:34.884
I wish I could say I was happy
to see you again.

1351
02:24:34.968 --> 02:24:36.427
Just picked up?

1352
02:24:36.511 --> 02:24:38.263
Yes, this morning.

1353
02:24:55.154 --> 02:24:57.782
There's a trainer out there I can fly.

1354
02:24:57.865 --> 02:25:00.326
- Any sentries?
- Yeah, it's gonna be a problem.

1355
02:26:08.561 --> 02:26:09.562
Colin...

1356
02:26:10.772 --> 02:26:13.149
when I say go, crank this clockwise.

1357
02:26:13.941 --> 02:26:17.278
When the engine catches, don't move,
or you'll get a mouthful of propeller.

1358
02:26:31.793 --> 02:26:32.794
Go.

1359
02:27:23.553 --> 02:27:25.263
Next stop, Switzerland!

1360
02:28:48.054 --> 02:28:49.138
The Alps.

1361
02:28:50.097 --> 02:28:51.098
Splendid.

1362
02:29:03.236 --> 02:29:06.531
Over this range, then 20 more minutes
and we've got it made.

1363
02:29:34.433 --> 02:29:35.893
What is it? Petrol?

1364
02:29:35.977 --> 02:29:38.646
I don't know. Fuel pump, carburetor.
We're losing power.

1365
02:30:03.921 --> 02:30:05.673
Go that way! I'll follow!

1366
02:30:30.573 --> 02:30:31.699
Hendley?

1367
02:30:36.829 --> 02:30:37.914
Colin?

1368
02:30:42.668 --> 02:30:45.129
Stop! Don't shoot! Please, don't -.

1369
02:30:49.175 --> 02:30:50.176
Colin?

1370
02:30:51.677 --> 02:30:53.220
I'm sorry I fouled things up.

1371
02:30:54.889 --> 02:30:56.265
That's all right.

1372
02:30:57.725 --> 02:30:59.310
Thank you for...

1373
02:31:00.686 --> 02:31:03.356
getting me... out.

1374
02:34:06.038 --> 02:34:07.373
Café Suzette.

1375
02:34:09.250 --> 02:34:10.292
Oui.

1376
02:34:22.471 --> 02:34:24.223
- Bon appétit, monsieur.
- Merci.

1377
02:34:27.560 --> 02:34:30.896
Uh, monsieur? Uh, telephone pour vous.

1378
02:34:31.939 --> 02:34:34.108
- Telephone pour moi?
- Oui, monsieur. Telephone.

1379
02:34:38.696 --> 02:34:39.780
Merci.

1380
02:34:41.448 --> 02:34:42.616
Hello?

1381
02:34:43.951 --> 02:34:45.035
Hello?

1382
02:35:23.115 --> 02:35:24.325
Résistance.

1383
02:35:24.825 --> 02:35:26.118
Résistance?

1384
02:35:26.744 --> 02:35:28.370
Uh, you are English?

1385
02:35:29.163 --> 02:35:30.748
Uh, I'm Australian.

1386
02:35:31.582 --> 02:35:34.460
You can speak English. I understand.

1387
02:35:34.543 --> 02:35:35.878
Bloody good.

1388
02:35:36.629 --> 02:35:41.008
I'm a British officer. I've just escaped
from a prisoner-of-war camp in Germany.

1389
02:35:41.091 --> 02:35:44.386
I'm trying to make my way into Spain now.
You understand me?

1390
02:35:44.470 --> 02:35:46.430
- Oui.
- Can you help me, now?

1391
02:35:50.559 --> 02:35:52.519
- I know someone who can.
- Bloody good.

1392
02:36:15.876 --> 02:36:17.336
Jawohl.

1393
02:36:33.852 --> 02:36:35.354
- Au revoir, monsieur.
- Au revoir.

1394
02:36:35.437 --> 02:36:38.065
Au revoir. Good luck.

1395
02:36:38.899 --> 02:36:40.192
Thank you.

1396
02:37:45.716 --> 02:37:47.509
Halt! Halt!

1397
02:38:32.429 --> 02:38:34.598
You are English.

1398
02:39:16.723 --> 02:39:18.142
Herr Bartlett?

1399
02:39:26.108 --> 02:39:27.776
Your German is good.

1400
02:39:28.694 --> 02:39:30.696
And I hear also your French.

1401
02:39:32.739 --> 02:39:35.534
Your arms... up!

1402
02:40:11.904 --> 02:40:13.989
Herr Bartlett.

1403
02:40:14.615 --> 02:40:16.742
And Herr MacDonald.

1404
02:40:19.661 --> 02:40:21.663
Oh, we are together again.

1405
02:40:22.581 --> 02:40:26.084
You are going to wish
you had never put us to so much trouble.

1406
02:40:42.351 --> 02:40:44.144
What's troubling you, Roger?

1407
02:40:44.228 --> 02:40:46.188
I'm just a little surprised.

1408
02:40:46.271 --> 02:40:49.816
I expected either a long stay
or a very short trip.

1409
02:40:49.900 --> 02:40:50.984
Yes.

1410
02:40:51.860 --> 02:40:54.571
I have to admit, I -
I'm a little worried, though.

1411
02:40:54.655 --> 02:40:57.324
I hope to God I haven't blotted
70-odd ledgers.

1412
02:40:57.407 --> 02:40:59.493
Och, no, no.

1413
02:40:59.576 --> 02:41:03.163
We're all over 21,
footloose and fancy-free.

1414
02:41:03.247 --> 02:41:06.333
We'd never have got as far as we did
without you, Roger.

1415
02:41:06.416 --> 02:41:09.962
For what it's worth,
I think you did a damn good job.

1416
02:41:10.045 --> 02:41:13.006
- I think we all do.
- Yes.

1417
02:41:53.171 --> 02:41:56.758
All right. You can get out now.
Stretch your legs for five minutes.

1418
02:41:56.842 --> 02:41:59.595
It will take hours
before you reach the camp.

1419
02:42:21.533 --> 02:42:23.327
You know, Mac, all this -

1420
02:42:23.410 --> 02:42:27.164
the organization, tunneling,
Tom and Harry -

1421
02:42:27.247 --> 02:42:28.540
kept me alive.

1422
02:42:29.791 --> 02:42:31.418
And even though we...

1423
02:42:33.420 --> 02:42:35.005
I've never been happier.

1424
02:42:36.465 --> 02:42:38.258
You know, Mac -.

1425
02:43:18.840 --> 02:43:21.968
Eleven of your men
are being returned today.

1426
02:43:22.052 --> 02:43:23.762
Oh? Who?

1427
02:43:23.845 --> 02:43:25.597
I do not have that information.

1428
02:43:26.264 --> 02:43:27.724
I -

1429
02:43:28.975 --> 02:43:32.270
I am directed by a higher authority
to inform you that -

1430
02:43:34.481 --> 02:43:37.859
that 50 of your officers
were shot while escaping.

1431
02:43:39.486 --> 02:43:40.487
Shot?

1432
02:43:42.030 --> 02:43:45.992
Their -
Their personal effects will be returned.

1433
02:43:48.537 --> 02:43:50.163
How many of them were wounded?

1434
02:43:52.666 --> 02:43:55.836
Here are the names... of the dead.

1435
02:43:59.256 --> 02:44:01.091
How many of the 50 were wounded?

1436
02:44:03.009 --> 02:44:04.177
None.

1437
02:44:05.429 --> 02:44:08.306
The - The higher authority

1438
02:44:09.057 --> 02:44:11.601
only directs me to inform you that -

1439
02:44:14.688 --> 02:44:16.189
that 50 men were...

1440
02:44:22.779 --> 02:44:23.905
I see.

1441
02:44:26.032 --> 02:44:28.034
Addison, John.

1442
02:44:28.118 --> 02:44:30.162
Alladale, Peter.

1443
02:44:30.245 --> 02:44:32.372
Bancroft, Edward.

1444
02:44:32.456 --> 02:44:34.624
Bartlett, Roger.

1445
02:44:34.708 --> 02:44:36.251
Cavendish, Dennis.

1446
02:44:37.002 --> 02:44:39.421
Eldridge, David.

1447
02:44:39.504 --> 02:44:41.506
Felton, William.

1448
02:44:42.591 --> 02:44:44.551
Fanshaw, Arthur.

1449
02:45:47.489 --> 02:45:49.491
- Au revoir.
- Merci beaucoup, monsieur.

1450
02:45:49.574 --> 02:45:52.410
- Au revoir.
- Au revoir.

1451
02:45:52.494 --> 02:45:53.912
Bonne chance.

1452
02:46:08.844 --> 02:46:10.679
I am your guide, señor.

1453
02:46:10.762 --> 02:46:12.055
To Spain?

1454
02:46:13.139 --> 02:46:14.307
España.

1455
02:46:34.286 --> 02:46:36.955
- Glad to see you're all safe.
- Thank you, sir.

1456
02:46:37.038 --> 02:46:39.457
- How many have been brought back, sir?
- You're the first.

1457
02:46:39.541 --> 02:46:41.793
- Do you know how many got away, sir?
- Not yet.

1458
02:46:43.003 --> 02:46:44.504
What happened to Blythe?

1459
02:46:45.797 --> 02:46:47.424
He didn't make it, sir.

1460
02:46:48.300 --> 02:46:50.218
Roger was right about that.

1461
02:46:51.219 --> 02:46:53.305
I'm afraid Roger didn't make it either.

1462
02:46:56.600 --> 02:47:00.270
I've just posted the list. They shot 50.

1463
02:47:01.187 --> 02:47:02.898
The Gestapo murdered them.

1464
02:47:04.274 --> 02:47:05.734
Fifty?

1465
02:47:05.817 --> 02:47:07.694
MacDonald, Ashley-Pitt?

1466
02:47:08.862 --> 02:47:11.072
- Yes.
- Danny and Willie?

1467
02:47:11.156 --> 02:47:12.741
No, they're not on the list.

1468
02:47:13.533 --> 02:47:15.535
- Haynes?
- Yes.

1469
02:47:17.495 --> 02:47:18.705
I'm sorry.

1470
02:47:21.041 --> 02:47:24.586
Roger's idea was to get back at
the enemy the hardest way he could.

1471
02:47:24.669 --> 02:47:26.046
Mess up the works.

1472
02:47:27.088 --> 02:47:29.966
From what we've heard here,
I think he did exactly that.

1473
02:47:30.800 --> 02:47:32.594
Do you think it was worth the price?

1474
02:47:34.012 --> 02:47:36.306
That depends on your point of view,
Hendley.

1475
02:47:39.601 --> 02:47:40.769
Yes, sir.

1476
02:47:54.532 --> 02:47:56.201
Achtung!

1477
02:48:29.693 --> 02:48:30.986
Achtung!

1478
02:48:31.069 --> 02:48:34.614
He is not to be saluted.
He's no longer in command.

1479
02:48:42.747 --> 02:48:44.582
The job just didn't work out, huh?

1480
02:48:45.375 --> 02:48:46.835
You were lucky, Hilts.

1481
02:48:46.918 --> 02:48:49.087
Lucky? It won't be because I didn't...

1482
02:48:51.089 --> 02:48:53.466
- How many?
- Fifty.

1483
02:48:56.094 --> 02:48:57.637
It looks, after all,

1484
02:48:58.346 --> 02:49:01.099
as if you will see Berlin before I do.

1485
02:49:53.985 --> 02:49:55.028
Sir.

1486
02:50:02.619 --> 02:50:03.745
Hey, Hilts!
