1
00:04:57.464 --> 00:05:00.550
Hurry up. Come on.
This way.

2
00:05:07.891 --> 00:05:09.518
Hurry up.

3
00:05:22.072 --> 00:05:24.783
This will do. Now which one
are you gonna have?

4
00:05:24.866 --> 00:05:26.868
- I'll have--
- No, that's mine.

5
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.787
Alley-oop!

6
00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.492
How far are the trees, Danny?

7
00:06:09.286 --> 00:06:11.371
Over 200 feet.

8
00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:13.248
I'd say 300.

9
00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.625
Long ways to digging.

10
00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:18.044
We'll get Cavendish
to make a survey.

11
00:06:18.128 --> 00:06:20.714
I wish Big X were here.

12
00:06:20.797 --> 00:06:22.924
Willie, you think X got away?

13
00:06:22.966 --> 00:06:24.968
No, he'd have sent us word
somehow if he had.

14
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.761
Gestapo, you think?

15
00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:28.805
Either that or he's dead.

16
00:06:44.905 --> 00:06:46.990
- Group Captain Ramsey?
- Yes?

17
00:06:47.032 --> 00:06:48.575
I am Strachwitz.

18
00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:51.244
Will you accompany me, please?

19
00:06:51.328 --> 00:06:53.455
- I'll look after your gear, sir.
- Right.

20
00:07:06.343 --> 00:07:08.261
Group Commander Ramsey.

21
00:07:09.346 --> 00:07:11.097
Good morning, Group Captain.

22
00:07:12.015 --> 00:07:15.101
I am Captain Posen,
Von Luger's adjutant.

23
00:07:15.185 --> 00:07:18.521
As senior British officer,
you are to be liaison...

24
00:07:18.563 --> 00:07:21.900
between the prisoners
and the colonel.

25
00:07:21.983 --> 00:07:24.194
We wish to make clear to you
certain matters of--

26
00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:27.530
The word is "policy"?

27
00:07:27.572 --> 00:07:29.741
- Yes.
- Thank you.

28
00:07:44.714 --> 00:07:46.675
Group Commander Ramsey.

29
00:07:47.842 --> 00:07:50.220
I am Colonel Von Luger.
Please sit down.

30
00:07:59.354 --> 00:08:02.732
Group Captain Ramsey,
in the past four years...

31
00:08:02.774 --> 00:08:06.027
the Reich has been forced to spend
an enormous amount of time...

32
00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:10.240
energy, manpower and equipment hunting
down escaping prisoner-of-war officers.

33
00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:14.577
At least it's rather nice to know
you're wanted, isn't it?

34
00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:17.747
For us it's not a matter for levity.

35
00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:20.583
There will be no escapes
from this camp.

36
00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:24.754
Colonel Von Luger, it is the sworn duty
of all officers to try to escape.

37
00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:27.257
If they can't, it is their sworn duty
to cause the enemy...

38
00:08:27.298 --> 00:08:30.260
to use an inordinate number
of troops to guard them...

39
00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:34.431
and their sworn duty to harass the enemy
to the best of their ability.

40
00:08:34.472 --> 00:08:36.433
Yes, I know.

41
00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:40.186
The men under your authority
have been most successful.

42
00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:43.314
This man, Ashley-Pitt, for example.

43
00:08:43.398 --> 00:08:46.443
Caught, escaped, recaptured,
escaped, recaptured.

44
00:08:47.736 --> 00:08:49.863
Archibald "Archie" Ives.

45
00:08:49.946 --> 00:08:51.406
Eleven escape attempts.

46
00:08:51.448 --> 00:08:53.950
Even tried to jump out of the truck
coming here.

47
00:08:54.868 --> 00:08:57.120
Dickes, William.

48
00:08:57.203 --> 00:09:00.498
Known to have participated
in digging of 11 escape tunnels.

49
00:09:00.582 --> 00:09:02.709
Flight Lieutenant Willinski,
four escapes.

50
00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:05.837
MacDonald, nine.
Hendley, an American, five.

51
00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.505
Haynes, four.
Sedgwick, seven.

52
00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:09.883
The list is almost endless.

53
00:09:09.966 --> 00:09:13.845
One man here has made
17 attempted escapes.

54
00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:16.181
Group Captain,
this is close to insanity.

55
00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:19.267
- Quite.
- And it must stop!

56
00:09:19.309 --> 00:09:22.479
Colonel, do you expect officers
to forget their duty?

57
00:09:28.359 --> 00:09:31.404
It is because we expect the opposite
that we have brought you here.

58
00:09:33.907 --> 00:09:36.284
This is a new camp.

59
00:09:36.326 --> 00:09:39.871
It has been built
to hold you and your men.

60
00:09:39.954 --> 00:09:43.166
It is organized to incorporate all
we have learned of security measures.

61
00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:47.754
And in me, you will not be dealing
with a common jailer...

62
00:09:49.089 --> 00:09:52.175
but with a staff officer
personally selected for the task...

63
00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:54.260
by the Luftwaffe High Command.

64
00:09:56.012 --> 00:10:00.558
We have, in effect, put all
our rotten eggs in one basket...

65
00:10:00.642 --> 00:10:03.895
and we intend to watch
this basket carefully.

66
00:10:04.646 --> 00:10:06.147
Very wise.

67
00:10:10.026 --> 00:10:12.195
You will not be denied
the use of facilities.

68
00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:16.324
Sports, the library...

69
00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:18.576
the recreation hall...

70
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:21.871
and for gardening,
we will give you tools.

71
00:10:21.913 --> 00:10:24.666
We trust you to use them
for gardening.

72
00:10:24.707 --> 00:10:27.752
Devote your energies
to these things.

73
00:10:27.836 --> 00:10:30.380
Give up your hopeless attempts
to escape...

74
00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:34.676
and, with intelligent cooperation...

75
00:10:34.717 --> 00:10:36.845
we may all sit out the war...

76
00:10:38.429 --> 00:10:41.015
as comfortably as possible.

77
00:10:58.575 --> 00:11:01.911
- What do you do here by the truck?
- I'm stealing tools.

78
00:11:01.995 --> 00:11:05.290
- For stealing tools, cooler.
- I was only kidding.

79
00:11:05.373 --> 00:11:07.792
- You are American.
- Yes, and you're a German.

80
00:11:07.876 --> 00:11:10.795
Of course.
Why do you come to Germany?

81
00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:12.881
Why fight for England,
your enemy?

82
00:11:12.922 --> 00:11:14.924
"Enemy"?
What are you talking about?

83
00:11:15.008 --> 00:11:17.760
In 1812,
they burned your capitol.

84
00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:19.762
- That's propaganda.
- It's in the history books.

85
00:11:19.846 --> 00:11:21.764
- It's pure propaganda.
- I read it.

86
00:11:21.848 --> 00:11:25.101
Now go away from here.
If you steal tools, cooler.

87
00:11:25.143 --> 00:11:26.769
Yeah, no tools.

88
00:11:32.942 --> 00:11:34.527
Hey, Virgil.

89
00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:37.113
Did you see the cooler?

90
00:11:37.197 --> 00:11:39.282
Boy, is it ever a big one.

91
00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:41.743
I think they expect
a lot of business.

92
00:11:41.784 --> 00:11:45.079
Those two guys who were with us
in the old camp in hut 14...

93
00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:46.581
I can't find them.

94
00:11:46.623 --> 00:11:49.626
- You think the goons left them behind?
- I guess.

95
00:11:49.667 --> 00:11:52.170
What were their names?
Jackson and--

96
00:11:53.296 --> 00:11:55.548
- And Dexter.
- Dexter. That's right.

97
00:11:55.632 --> 00:11:58.384
I'm gonna see who else I can find.
I'll see ya later.

98
00:12:23.493 --> 00:12:24.911
Danny, who are they?

99
00:12:25.995 --> 00:12:28.873
Russian prisoners.
They cut down trees.

100
00:12:28.957 --> 00:12:32.168
- They keep them here?
- No, they take them out.

101
00:12:34.462 --> 00:12:36.172
Willie, cigarettes.

102
00:12:56.567 --> 00:13:00.321
Danny and I have a blitz in mind.
Could you put on a show for the goons?

103
00:13:00.363 --> 00:13:02.782
Sure, mate.
What will it be? An all-out go?

104
00:13:02.865 --> 00:13:04.450
- Mad prisoner?
- Choir practice.

105
00:13:04.534 --> 00:13:07.203
- Knuckles, eh?
- Knuckles would be fine.

106
00:13:07.245 --> 00:13:09.205
Give him the coat.

107
00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.500
What are you doing
with my coat, mate?

108
00:13:12.542 --> 00:13:13.918
It's mine!

109
00:13:14.002 --> 00:13:16.045
Are you pushing me,
you common Canadian?

110
00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:18.172
It's mine,
you illiterate Aussie--

111
00:13:44.032 --> 00:13:46.534
I'll send you back
to the Commonwealth!

112
00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:50.663
Stop it!
Stop this nonsense!

113
00:13:50.747 --> 00:13:52.540
It's all right, mate.

114
00:13:52.582 --> 00:13:54.584
We're just having
a friendly little argument.

115
00:13:54.625 --> 00:13:57.337
- No more fighting. No more!
- All right.

116
00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.339
- Get back in your huts.
- Yes, sir.

117
00:13:59.422 --> 00:14:00.965
You too!

118
00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:04.886
Get away!
Get back in your huts!

119
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:08.765
Go on!

120
00:14:40.588 --> 00:14:41.964
Hey, Hilts!

121
00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.801
Looks like there's
only one other American.

122
00:14:44.842 --> 00:14:47.470
Some guy named Hendley
in the RAF Eagle squadron.

123
00:14:47.553 --> 00:14:49.931
You got something going already?

124
00:14:49.972 --> 00:14:52.100
See the way the goons
got those towers placed?

125
00:14:53.226 --> 00:14:55.395
- Yeah.
- Got a blind spot in the middle.

126
00:14:55.478 --> 00:14:56.813
A blind spot?

127
00:14:56.896 --> 00:14:59.774
Guy could stand at that wire and not
be seen by that tower or that tower.

128
00:14:59.816 --> 00:15:02.860
The one on the end is too far. They'd
never see me, especially at night.

129
00:15:02.944 --> 00:15:04.987
- You're crazy.
- You think so?

130
00:15:05.071 --> 00:15:06.906
Let's find out.
Right now.

131
00:15:24.048 --> 00:15:26.717
Now, the next step's
a little tricky.

132
00:15:26.801 --> 00:15:29.720
- You're not going out there?
- While they're looking I'm not.

133
00:15:33.015 --> 00:15:35.017
I think I'll take a little walk.

134
00:15:38.521 --> 00:15:39.814
March!

135
00:16:17.643 --> 00:16:20.396
- Danny, do you speak Russian?
- A little, but only one sentence.

136
00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.731
Let me have it.

137
00:16:29.947 --> 00:16:32.074
- What's it mean?
- I love you.

138
00:16:33.242 --> 00:16:35.703
"Love you."
What bloody good is that?

139
00:16:35.745 --> 00:16:38.080
I don't know.
I wasn't going to use it myself.

140
00:16:55.264 --> 00:16:56.641
Halt!

141
00:17:03.147 --> 00:17:05.233
Out. Out!

142
00:17:06.943 --> 00:17:08.110
Your friend?

143
00:17:10.571 --> 00:17:13.783
And who vouches for you,
Lieutenant Willinski?

144
00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:15.409
Get out, Sedgwick.

145
00:17:53.197 --> 00:17:54.532
Hold it!

146
00:17:59.078 --> 00:18:01.289
- Your name?
- Ives.

147
00:18:04.584 --> 00:18:07.753
Oh, yes.
Archibald Ives. Scot.

148
00:18:07.837 --> 00:18:10.339
The photograph
doesn't do justice.

149
00:18:10.381 --> 00:18:13.426
I'd like to see one of you
under similar circumstances.

150
00:18:38.868 --> 00:18:41.537
I will not take action
against you now.

151
00:18:41.579 --> 00:18:45.041
This is the first day here,
and there has been much stupidity and...

152
00:18:45.082 --> 00:18:49.003
carelessness on both sides.

153
00:19:07.063 --> 00:19:08.397
Hey! Get out!

154
00:19:12.193 --> 00:19:13.611
Don't shoot!

155
00:19:16.906 --> 00:19:19.116
You fool!
You cross the wire of death!

156
00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.911
- What wire?
- This wire! The warning wire!

157
00:19:23.412 --> 00:19:26.248
It's absolutely forbidden to cross it!
You know that!

158
00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:29.919
Yeah, but my baseball rolled over there.
How am I gonna get my baseball?

159
00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:31.921
You first ask permission.

160
00:19:35.132 --> 00:19:37.635
- Get my baseball!
- Stop this nonsense! Get over the wire!

161
00:19:37.718 --> 00:19:40.680
- Immediately!
- You, stay there!

162
00:19:40.763 --> 00:19:43.015
Out of the way.

163
00:19:47.812 --> 00:19:50.022
What were you doing over here?

164
00:19:50.106 --> 00:19:52.191
Like I told Max,
I was trying to get my--

165
00:20:04.537 --> 00:20:08.040
- What were you doing by the wire?
- Like I told Max--

166
00:20:08.124 --> 00:20:11.210
I was trying to cut my way through
your wire because I wanna get out.

167
00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:20.678
You speak German?

168
00:20:22.513 --> 00:20:23.806
Wire cutters.

169
00:20:26.642 --> 00:20:31.147
I have had the pleasure of knowing
many British officers in this war...

170
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:33.566
and I flatter myself that
we understand one another.

171
00:20:40.781 --> 00:20:43.951
You are the first American officer
I've met. Hilts, isn't it?

172
00:20:43.993 --> 00:20:45.870
Captain Hilts, actually.

173
00:20:45.953 --> 00:20:47.955
- Seventeen escape attempts.
- Eighteen, sir.

174
00:20:47.997 --> 00:20:49.373
Tunnel man. Engineer.

175
00:20:50.458 --> 00:20:51.584
Flier.

176
00:20:51.667 --> 00:20:55.379
I suppose what's called
in the American army, a "hotshot pilot."

177
00:20:55.463 --> 00:20:58.174
Unfortunately,
you got shot down anyway.

178
00:20:58.215 --> 00:21:01.010
So we are both grounded
for the duration of the war.

179
00:21:01.093 --> 00:21:03.179
You speak for yourself, Colonel.

180
00:21:07.641 --> 00:21:09.101
You have other plans?

181
00:21:09.185 --> 00:21:11.228
I haven't seen Berlin
from the ground or air.

182
00:21:11.312 --> 00:21:13.689
I plan on doing both
before the war is over.

183
00:21:13.731 --> 00:21:17.026
Are all American officers
so ill-mannered?

184
00:21:18.152 --> 00:21:19.779
About 99%.

185
00:21:21.071 --> 00:21:23.949
Perhaps while you are with us,
you will learn some.

186
00:21:24.033 --> 00:21:26.035
Ten days' isolation, Hilts.

187
00:21:27.161 --> 00:21:29.872
- Captain Hilts.
- Twenty days.

188
00:21:29.914 --> 00:21:31.499
Right.

189
00:21:33.042 --> 00:21:35.127
You'll still be here
when I get out?

190
00:21:36.504 --> 00:21:38.464
Cooler.

191
00:21:46.305 --> 00:21:47.932
- Name?
- Ives.

192
00:21:49.016 --> 00:21:51.060
Flying Officer Ives.

193
00:21:51.143 --> 00:21:52.812
Cooler, twenty days.

194
00:21:56.607 --> 00:21:58.943
- Cooler, Ives.
- Pleasure.

195
00:23:39.919 --> 00:23:42.671
What did you do in the States?
Play baseball?

196
00:23:42.713 --> 00:23:44.673
I was in college.

197
00:23:46.175 --> 00:23:49.720
Say, Ives.
How many escapes have you tried?

198
00:23:49.803 --> 00:23:52.556
Four over, seven under.

199
00:23:54.433 --> 00:23:57.937
- Tunnel man, huh?
- Sure, I'm not.

200
00:23:59.355 --> 00:24:00.856
How tall are you?

201
00:24:02.191 --> 00:24:04.026
Five-feet-four. Why?

202
00:24:04.902 --> 00:24:06.779
Just wondering.

203
00:24:08.238 --> 00:24:11.951
What did you do in college?
Study physical education?

204
00:24:12.034 --> 00:24:14.912
Chemical engineering.
Did a little bike riding, though.

205
00:24:14.995 --> 00:24:16.580
Bicycles?

206
00:24:17.665 --> 00:24:21.210
Motorcycles.
You know, flat tracks, county fairs.

207
00:24:21.293 --> 00:24:23.796
Picked up a buck here and there.
Helped pay my tuition.

208
00:24:23.879 --> 00:24:25.881
I did a wee bit racing myself.

209
00:24:25.923 --> 00:24:28.425
- In Scotland.
- Bikes?

210
00:24:28.509 --> 00:24:32.054
No, horse racing.
Jockey.

211
00:24:33.931 --> 00:24:35.391
Jockey.

212
00:24:39.061 --> 00:24:40.145
Jockey?

213
00:24:47.319 --> 00:24:48.904
Are you there, Hilts?

214
00:24:51.699 --> 00:24:55.035
- I'm here.
- Do you have jockeys in the States?

215
00:24:56.662 --> 00:24:59.498
- Sure.
- They were the days.

216
00:24:59.581 --> 00:25:04.003
Saturday nights in towns
like Mussoboro and Hamilton.

217
00:25:04.086 --> 00:25:06.964
You could pay off the "birds."

218
00:25:07.047 --> 00:25:08.966
You know, "birds."

219
00:25:09.049 --> 00:25:11.260
Girls, man.

220
00:25:12.344 --> 00:25:14.263
You know of them in the States?

221
00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.227
Are you there, Hilts?

222
00:25:26.025 --> 00:25:27.943
What?

223
00:25:28.027 --> 00:25:30.988
You know the kind of clay and gravel
we've got here in the compound?

224
00:25:31.071 --> 00:25:32.614
Aye.

225
00:25:32.656 --> 00:25:35.826
How many feet you think you can
get through in, say, eight hours?

226
00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:38.370
I could cut through this stuff here...

227
00:25:38.454 --> 00:25:40.456
like the bit on an end of an auger.

228
00:25:40.497 --> 00:25:42.499
But you know, it's not the digging.

229
00:25:42.583 --> 00:25:44.334
It's the shoring up with wood...

230
00:25:44.418 --> 00:25:46.128
and getting the dirt out.

231
00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:47.963
That's what you have to worry about.

232
00:25:48.005 --> 00:25:50.966
No, it isn't, Ives.
You don't have to worry about that.

233
00:25:51.008 --> 00:25:53.343
How you going to get the dirt out?

234
00:25:53.427 --> 00:25:56.138
What do they call a mole
in Scotland?

235
00:25:56.221 --> 00:25:57.473
A mole.

236
00:25:58.599 --> 00:25:59.600
Aye.

237
00:26:02.186 --> 00:26:04.354
Well, what do you think, Navy?

238
00:26:05.647 --> 00:26:08.150
I must say, it's an interesting
first 20 minutes.

239
00:26:08.233 --> 00:26:10.652
I'd say we made fools of ourselves.

240
00:26:10.694 --> 00:26:14.281
You know what this is?
This is only the first day.

241
00:26:33.967 --> 00:26:37.638
Don't take too much notice.
The goons may not know who he is.

242
00:26:37.679 --> 00:26:40.682
- I'll pass the word.
- I'll tell the old man.

243
00:26:52.152 --> 00:26:55.823
The prisoner Bartlett is discharged
into your custody, Colonel Von Luger.

244
00:27:06.542 --> 00:27:08.752
I suggest this prisoner Bartlett
to be kept...

245
00:27:08.836 --> 00:27:11.255
under the strictest security
confinement permanently.

246
00:27:12.923 --> 00:27:15.175
Make a note
of Herr Kuhn's suggestion.

247
00:27:16.385 --> 00:27:18.387
We have reason to believe
that this prisoner...

248
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:21.140
is the leader of numerous
criminal escape attempts.

249
00:27:22.891 --> 00:27:26.895
Squadron Leader Bartlett
has been three months in your care...

250
00:27:26.937 --> 00:27:30.357
and the Gestapo has only
"reason to believe"?

251
00:27:30.399 --> 00:27:32.901
If he once more
falls into our hands...

252
00:27:32.985 --> 00:27:34.820
he will not be so lucky.

253
00:27:34.903 --> 00:27:36.822
Air Force officer prisoners...

254
00:27:36.905 --> 00:27:40.242
are the responsibility
of the Luftwaffe, not the S.S.!

255
00:27:43.078 --> 00:27:45.038
Or the Gestapo.

256
00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:47.708
At present, yes.

257
00:27:47.749 --> 00:27:50.210
That is why he's returned,
for the moment...

258
00:27:50.252 --> 00:27:51.628
to your care.

259
00:27:51.712 --> 00:27:52.754
Of course...

260
00:27:52.838 --> 00:27:54.798
if the Luftwaffe
is not up to the task...

261
00:27:54.882 --> 00:27:57.593
the prisoner will find themselves
totally in our charge.

262
00:27:57.676 --> 00:28:00.721
We regretfully are not
so professionally understanding.

263
00:28:06.018 --> 00:28:08.478
Squadron Leader Bartlett.

264
00:28:08.562 --> 00:28:13.442
If you escape again and be caught,
you will be shot.

265
00:29:12.167 --> 00:29:14.086
- Eric.
- Hello, Roger.

266
00:29:14.169 --> 00:29:16.588
- They dumped you in here too.
- Yes. What's this one like?

267
00:29:16.672 --> 00:29:18.340
Well, it's new.

268
00:29:19.508 --> 00:29:22.469
Here.
Let's find you a bed.

269
00:29:22.511 --> 00:29:23.929
Thanks.

270
00:29:40.862 --> 00:29:42.114
Come in.

271
00:29:44.199 --> 00:29:46.285
- Hello, Roger.
- Hello, sir.

272
00:29:47.411 --> 00:29:49.621
I'll put your bag in your room.

273
00:29:49.705 --> 00:29:51.039
Thanks, Eric.

274
00:29:51.123 --> 00:29:54.042
- How are you?
- As well as could be expected.

275
00:29:54.126 --> 00:29:57.587
The fellows wanted to put up a welcome
committee for you, but that's for later.

276
00:29:57.671 --> 00:29:59.840
Yes, I saw Willie and Willinski
with Mac.

277
00:29:59.881 --> 00:30:02.301
Lot of old friends here.

278
00:30:02.384 --> 00:30:05.220
- How long have you been here?
- Arrived today.

279
00:30:05.304 --> 00:30:07.973
New camp, expert guards.
The elite.

280
00:30:09.057 --> 00:30:10.976
You met the commandant?

281
00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:13.979
Yes, I did.

282
00:30:14.062 --> 00:30:16.982
What were the Gestapo
and the S.S. doing with you?

283
00:30:17.065 --> 00:30:19.901
They wanted to find out
who had helped me to the border.

284
00:30:19.943 --> 00:30:22.279
Who else is here?
Have we got Cavendish?

285
00:30:22.362 --> 00:30:25.324
- Nimmo and Sorren?
- Griffith, Haynes.

286
00:30:25.407 --> 00:30:27.909
- Blythe?
- Yes.

287
00:30:27.951 --> 00:30:30.203
Almost the whole X organization.

288
00:30:30.245 --> 00:30:31.747
Almost.

289
00:30:32.831 --> 00:30:35.459
They cleaned out all the other camps
and dumped us in this one.

290
00:30:35.542 --> 00:30:37.210
As Von Luger put it...

291
00:30:37.252 --> 00:30:40.088
"all the rotten eggs
in one basket."

292
00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:43.759
There's madness in their method.
What about Tommy Bristol?

293
00:30:45.093 --> 00:30:47.554
No, but there's an American.
Hendley.

294
00:30:48.847 --> 00:30:51.141
Is he a scrounger?
Blackmailer?

295
00:30:51.224 --> 00:30:52.976
MacDonald says he's the best.

296
00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:54.895
Good.

297
00:30:56.063 --> 00:30:59.149
Last of the tea until the Red Cross
gets through again.

298
00:30:59.232 --> 00:31:00.817
I scrounged this from Sedgwick.

299
00:31:06.782 --> 00:31:08.867
Did the Gestapo
give you a rough time?

300
00:31:09.785 --> 00:31:12.871
Not nearly as rough
as I now intend to give them.

301
00:31:13.663 --> 00:31:15.832
Personal revenge...

302
00:31:15.916 --> 00:31:18.543
must be kept out
of what we have to do here.

303
00:31:18.627 --> 00:31:20.629
Too many lives are at stake.

304
00:31:23.423 --> 00:31:26.802
What my personal feelings are
is of no importance.

305
00:31:28.011 --> 00:31:29.888
You appointed me Big X.

306
00:31:29.971 --> 00:31:32.307
It's my duty to harass,
confound and confuse the enemy...

307
00:31:32.349 --> 00:31:34.142
to the best of my ability.

308
00:31:34.184 --> 00:31:37.479
- That's true.
- That's what I intend to do.

309
00:31:39.106 --> 00:31:42.317
I'm gonna cause such a terrible stink
in this Third Reich of theirs...

310
00:31:42.401 --> 00:31:45.320
that thousands of troops
that could be employed at the front...

311
00:31:45.404 --> 00:31:47.322
will be tied up here
looking after us.

312
00:31:47.406 --> 00:31:48.782
How?

313
00:31:48.824 --> 00:31:50.826
By putting more men
out of this...

314
00:31:51.952 --> 00:31:54.871
perfect camp of theirs
than have ever escaped before.

315
00:31:54.955 --> 00:31:56.873
Not blitzing out two or three
or a dozen...

316
00:31:56.957 --> 00:31:59.918
but 200, 300.
Scatter them all over Germany.

317
00:32:00.001 --> 00:32:02.421
- Do you think that's possible?
- The men are here to do it.

318
00:32:02.504 --> 00:32:05.924
The goons have put every escape artist
in Germany in this camp.

319
00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:10.095
Have you thought of
what it might cost?

320
00:32:12.347 --> 00:32:16.685
I've thought of the humiliation
if we just tamely submit...

321
00:32:16.726 --> 00:32:18.687
knuckle under and crawl.

322
00:32:18.728 --> 00:32:20.647
You don't advocate that,
do you, sir?

323
00:32:22.441 --> 00:32:25.318
I have to point out
one thing to you, Roger.

324
00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:28.321
No matter how unsatisfactory
this camp may be...

325
00:32:28.363 --> 00:32:31.616
the high command have still left us
in the hands of the Luftwaffe...

326
00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:33.869
not the Gestapo and the S.S.

327
00:32:35.912 --> 00:32:39.583
Look, sir, you talk about
the high command and the Luftwaffe...

328
00:32:39.666 --> 00:32:41.585
and then the S.S. and the Gestapo.

329
00:32:41.668 --> 00:32:44.212
To me, they're the same.
We're fighting the bloody lot.

330
00:32:45.547 --> 00:32:47.632
There's only one way
to put it, sir.

331
00:32:47.716 --> 00:32:51.303
They are the common enemies
of everyone who believes in freedom.

332
00:32:51.386 --> 00:32:54.473
If the high command didn't approve of
Hitler, why didn't they throw him out?

333
00:32:54.556 --> 00:32:56.600
I have no argument
with you, Roger.

334
00:32:57.434 --> 00:32:58.894
As senior officer...

335
00:32:58.935 --> 00:33:01.396
I'm merely pointing out
a pertinent fact.

336
00:33:04.649 --> 00:33:07.319
When are you calling
a meeting, X?

337
00:33:15.368 --> 00:33:16.828
Tonight.

338
00:33:28.632 --> 00:33:30.675
Gentlemen,
no doubt you've heard...

339
00:33:30.759 --> 00:33:34.721
the immortal words
of our new commandant.

340
00:33:34.763 --> 00:33:37.265
"Devote your energies
to things other than escape...

341
00:33:37.349 --> 00:33:39.976
and sit out the war
as comfortably as possible.”

342
00:33:42.229 --> 00:33:45.273
That's exactly
what we're going to do.

343
00:33:45.357 --> 00:33:48.693
We're gonna devote our energies
to sports and gardening.

344
00:33:48.777 --> 00:33:51.571
All the cultural pursuits,
as far as they're concerned.

345
00:33:51.613 --> 00:33:53.990
In fact, we're gonna put
the goons to sleep.

346
00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:58.203
Meanwhile, we dig.

347
00:33:59.913 --> 00:34:02.874
Now, even a superficial look
at the compound...

348
00:34:02.958 --> 00:34:06.211
shows us that huts 104 and 105
are closest to the woods.

349
00:34:06.294 --> 00:34:09.464
The first tunnel goes out
from 105 directly east...

350
00:34:09.548 --> 00:34:12.467
under the cooler and the wire.

351
00:34:12.551 --> 00:34:14.135
That's over 300 feet.

352
00:34:14.219 --> 00:34:17.305
- Did you make a survey, Dennis?
- Only a temporary one, sir.

353
00:34:17.347 --> 00:34:19.432
I make it just over 335 feet.

354
00:34:19.474 --> 00:34:21.977
Let me know when you've got
an exact one. Willie.

355
00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:25.146
This time we'll dig straight down
30 feet before we go horizontal.

356
00:34:25.188 --> 00:34:27.148
That'll rule out
sound detection or probing.

357
00:34:28.525 --> 00:34:31.611
All right, Roger,
but did you say the first tunnel?

358
00:34:31.653 --> 00:34:32.654
I did.

359
00:34:33.572 --> 00:34:35.198
There'll be three.

360
00:34:36.324 --> 00:34:40.620
We'll call them Tom, Dick and Harry.
Tom goes out directly east from 104.

361
00:34:40.662 --> 00:34:45.208
Dick goes north from the kitchen,
and Harry goes parallel to Tom from 105.

362
00:34:47.043 --> 00:34:50.589
If the goons find one,
we'll move into the other.

363
00:34:50.672 --> 00:34:53.133
How many men
do you plan to take out?

364
00:34:54.509 --> 00:34:55.802
250.

365
00:34:57.345 --> 00:34:59.347
There'll be no half measures
this time, gentlemen.

366
00:34:59.389 --> 00:35:02.017
There'll be identification papers
and documents for everyone.

367
00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:05.228
Griff, we'll need outfits
for the lot.

368
00:35:05.312 --> 00:35:07.939
- 2507
- Mostly civilian clothes.

369
00:35:08.023 --> 00:35:09.899
Yes, but, uh--

370
00:35:11.443 --> 00:35:13.236
Okay, Roger.

371
00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:16.990
Mac, maps, blankets,
rations, compasses...

372
00:35:17.032 --> 00:35:19.451
for all the walkers
and timetables for every train.

373
00:35:19.534 --> 00:35:20.869
Right, Roger.

374
00:35:26.207 --> 00:35:27.792
Sorry I'm late, Roger.

375
00:35:27.876 --> 00:35:30.587
All right, Collin, sit down.
We're going to tunnel.

376
00:35:32.714 --> 00:35:34.674
Splendid.

377
00:35:34.716 --> 00:35:37.010
Willie, you and Danny
will be tunnel kings.

378
00:35:37.052 --> 00:35:40.722
Danny, you'll be in charge of traps.
We'll work out their location tomorrow.

379
00:35:40.764 --> 00:35:44.059
Sedgwick, manufacturer.
Griff, as I said, tailor.

380
00:35:44.142 --> 00:35:48.980
Nimmo and Haynes, diversions.
Mac will take care of intelligence.

381
00:35:49.064 --> 00:35:51.650
Hendley? We haven't met.

382
00:35:51.733 --> 00:35:54.527
- Scrounger?
- Right.

383
00:35:54.569 --> 00:35:57.113
Dennis, maps and surveys.

384
00:35:57.197 --> 00:35:59.407
Collin, you'll take
your usual job.

385
00:35:59.491 --> 00:36:01.868
Eric, how are you
gonna get rid of this dirt?

386
00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:03.495
The usual places.

387
00:36:04.454 --> 00:36:06.873
Hadn't anticipated three tunnels,
but we'll manage.

388
00:36:08.333 --> 00:36:10.335
Who's gonna handle security
for all this?

389
00:36:10.418 --> 00:36:12.212
You are.

390
00:36:12.253 --> 00:36:15.590
I want a system of stooges covering
this compound from front to back...

391
00:36:15.632 --> 00:36:18.551
checking every goon in and out.

392
00:36:18.593 --> 00:36:21.221
I want a signal system so perfect...

393
00:36:21.262 --> 00:36:24.265
that if a fellow gets near
a hut in which we're working...

394
00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:26.351
we can shut down without a sign.

395
00:36:30.939 --> 00:36:32.941
There's no point
in discussing more now.

396
00:36:32.982 --> 00:36:36.569
I'll meet each of you on the exercise
circuit to pound out the details.

397
00:36:39.948 --> 00:36:42.033
Nothing else, is there, Mac?

398
00:36:42.117 --> 00:36:44.119
I shouldn't think so, Roger.

399
00:37:10.061 --> 00:37:12.981
Oh, hello.
My name's Blythe.

400
00:37:20.822 --> 00:37:22.240
For birds.

401
00:37:22.323 --> 00:37:24.868
- I've done a little hunting myself.
- Not hunting.

402
00:37:24.951 --> 00:37:26.202
Watching.

403
00:37:29.122 --> 00:37:30.540
Bird-watcher?

404
00:37:30.623 --> 00:37:34.335
Yes, that's right.
Watching them and drawing them.

405
00:37:37.005 --> 00:37:39.382
I suppose you have bird-watchers
in the States.

406
00:37:39.466 --> 00:37:41.926
Yes, we have some.

407
00:37:43.219 --> 00:37:44.596
Tea?

408
00:37:45.513 --> 00:37:48.224
I only drank tea once,
in a hospital.

409
00:37:49.684 --> 00:37:51.019
Where's your kit?

410
00:37:52.103 --> 00:37:55.398
This is it. The rest was confiscated
in the last shakedown.

411
00:37:56.858 --> 00:38:00.361
The goons didn't appreciate
some of my more personal items.

412
00:38:04.991 --> 00:38:06.534
Such as.

413
00:38:06.618 --> 00:38:08.369
You're the scrounger.

414
00:38:08.453 --> 00:38:10.330
Yes, that's right.

415
00:38:10.371 --> 00:38:12.081
I'll need a camera.

416
00:38:14.042 --> 00:38:16.836
- What kind?
- A good one.

417
00:38:16.878 --> 00:38:19.172
A 35-millimeter 2.8...

418
00:38:19.214 --> 00:38:22.175
with a focal plane shutter
should do all right.

419
00:38:24.385 --> 00:38:25.637
All right.

420
00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:27.263
And film, of course.

421
00:38:27.347 --> 00:38:29.265
Oh, of course.

422
00:38:30.558 --> 00:38:34.103
Oh, Hendley, I need a pick.
Big heavy one.

423
00:38:34.187 --> 00:38:36.189
- Only one?
- Two would be better.

424
00:38:41.361 --> 00:38:43.446
Afraid this tea's pathetic.

425
00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:46.908
Must have used these wretched leaves
about 20 times.

426
00:38:47.992 --> 00:38:50.453
It's not that I mind so much.

427
00:38:50.537 --> 00:38:53.164
Tea without milk
is so uncivilized.

428
00:38:53.957 --> 00:38:56.793
Yeah. I'll get our wood.

429
00:39:05.593 --> 00:39:07.095
Close up.

430
00:39:15.311 --> 00:39:16.729
Close up.

431
00:39:20.775 --> 00:39:22.068
Close up.

432
00:39:50.096 --> 00:39:51.556
Splendid.

433
00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:06.362
Blythe, what are you doing here?

434
00:40:08.281 --> 00:40:12.118
I'm in photographic aerial
reconnaissance interpretation.

435
00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:16.039
Went for a joyride to see for myself.
It's my own silly fault.

436
00:40:16.122 --> 00:40:19.667
The aircraft bought it.
Got shot down.

437
00:40:19.709 --> 00:40:21.127
Terrifying.

438
00:40:21.169 --> 00:40:23.838
No, I mean,
what do you do here?

439
00:40:24.756 --> 00:40:26.132
Here?

440
00:40:28.343 --> 00:40:29.844
I'm the forger.

441
00:40:50.198 --> 00:40:53.701
The forgers are installing themselves
in the recreation hut. Sedgwick?

442
00:40:53.743 --> 00:40:56.120
- I'm in 110.
- Griffith?

443
00:40:56.204 --> 00:40:58.373
I'd like to work in 109, Roger.

444
00:40:58.414 --> 00:41:00.708
109? Right.

445
00:41:00.792 --> 00:41:03.670
I'l work in 107. For now,
Danny and Willie and their team...

446
00:41:03.711 --> 00:41:05.254
will be in 104.

447
00:41:05.338 --> 00:41:09.550
I want to take a chance on the tunnels
and press ahead without shoring up.

448
00:41:09.634 --> 00:41:12.887
We will need timber for the shaft
and the entrance chambers.

449
00:41:12.971 --> 00:41:15.431
Hendley figures
there are 36 empty bunks.

450
00:41:15.515 --> 00:41:19.519
We can tear up 15 and move men between
huts so the goons won't miss them.

451
00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:21.938
The rest will come
from the strips off the wall.

452
00:41:22.021 --> 00:41:24.065
- Is Hendley handling this himself?
- Not yet.

453
00:41:24.107 --> 00:41:27.193
He's working on some steel
for a pick that Danny needs.

454
00:41:46.629 --> 00:41:49.424
What is going on here?
Turn the water off!

455
00:41:49.507 --> 00:41:51.134
Get your hand away!

456
00:41:59.183 --> 00:42:00.727
Stop this nonsense!

457
00:42:04.105 --> 00:42:06.733
Get away here!
Turn the water off!

458
00:42:06.774 --> 00:42:08.109
Somewhere!

459
00:42:48.316 --> 00:42:51.319
In the stove,
we keep fire burning always.

460
00:42:51.402 --> 00:42:53.654
This way the goons
will not feel like moving it.

461
00:42:53.738 --> 00:42:55.198
Good.

462
00:42:56.324 --> 00:42:58.785
Two tiles are chipped.
We need new ones.

463
00:42:58.826 --> 00:43:01.954
There are some in 113's washroom.
Should match perfectly.

464
00:43:12.006 --> 00:43:14.092
It's going to be
a bit tricky, Danny.

465
00:43:16.094 --> 00:43:18.304
Not when you're organized, Mac.

466
00:43:23.017 --> 00:43:25.019
- We're ready.
- Big enough?

467
00:43:25.103 --> 00:43:28.189
It's perfect. Right through
the middle of the foundation.

468
00:43:35.113 --> 00:43:36.656
Good luck to us, Danny.

469
00:43:55.716 --> 00:43:57.718
Why 17?

470
00:43:57.802 --> 00:44:00.388
This is the 17th tunnel
Danny's started.

471
00:44:49.854 --> 00:44:51.189
It's good.

472
00:45:00.698 --> 00:45:02.700
It's very good.

473
00:45:02.783 --> 00:45:04.118
Haynes.

474
00:45:40.988 --> 00:45:42.990
Get out! Get out!

475
00:45:59.674 --> 00:46:01.509
Out. Out here.

476
00:46:06.264 --> 00:46:08.432
You are not in your hut.

477
00:46:08.516 --> 00:46:11.143
- What are you doing here?
- Mopping up.

478
00:46:15.481 --> 00:46:18.484
- And you?
- Shower. I need a wash.

479
00:46:22.613 --> 00:46:25.533
I'm watchin' him.
I'm a lifeguard.

480
00:46:30.079 --> 00:46:32.373
Put on warm clothes.
You might be outside all night.

481
00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:23.924
No. I vote no.

482
00:47:24.008 --> 00:47:27.553
We've put the goons to sleep like
you said, but one thing like this...

483
00:47:27.595 --> 00:47:29.597
and we're up the creek
without a paddle.

484
00:47:31.599 --> 00:47:33.601
Sit down, won't you?

485
00:47:33.642 --> 00:47:34.935
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

486
00:47:35.019 --> 00:47:37.355
Squadron Leader Bartlett,
Captain Hilts.

487
00:47:37.438 --> 00:47:39.523
- Flight Lieutenant MacDonald.
- Hi.

488
00:47:40.441 --> 00:47:43.569
I understand you two
are contemplating a blitz out.

489
00:47:43.611 --> 00:47:45.780
Where'd you hear that, sir?

490
00:47:45.821 --> 00:47:48.741
MacDonald. It's Mac's job
to know everything that goes on.

491
00:47:50.618 --> 00:47:52.787
We thought, perhaps,
we might talk it over.

492
00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:54.872
Why? It's only a two-man job.

493
00:47:54.955 --> 00:47:56.248
Everybody in the camp...

494
00:47:56.290 --> 00:47:59.085
is supposed to clear
all escape attempts in advance...

495
00:47:59.126 --> 00:48:00.586
with Bartlett.

496
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:03.964
We don't necessarily
want to interfere.

497
00:48:04.048 --> 00:48:05.132
It's just that...

498
00:48:06.967 --> 00:48:09.428
What sort of blitz
were you contemplating?

499
00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:13.349
We sneak out at night to a blind spot
I found near the wire.

500
00:48:13.432 --> 00:48:15.351
Then we dig straight down
three feet...

501
00:48:15.434 --> 00:48:18.938
take the dirt, spread it on top so it
won't make a pile and then straight out.

502
00:48:18.979 --> 00:48:21.524
Ives is a tunnel man,
so he digs in front...

503
00:48:21.607 --> 00:48:24.527
pushes the dirt behind him,
and I stash it behind me.

504
00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:27.530
Then we burrow through the dirt
like a couple of moles.

505
00:48:27.613 --> 00:48:30.074
By dawn, we're under the wire,
into the woods...

506
00:48:30.991 --> 00:48:32.326
and gone.

507
00:48:42.253 --> 00:48:44.964
When do you intend to try this?

508
00:48:45.005 --> 00:48:47.425
- When do you intend to try it?
- Tonight.

509
00:48:49.969 --> 00:48:53.013
This may not be quite the right time
for this sort of thing.

510
00:48:53.097 --> 00:48:56.517
Look, sir. I've been in the bank
nearly three years now.

511
00:48:56.559 --> 00:48:58.936
Bloody close
to being wire-happy.

512
00:48:59.019 --> 00:49:01.105
It's a blitz out for me
or forget it.

513
00:49:02.189 --> 00:49:05.025
It'll work.
I know it will.

514
00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:14.535
Good luck.

515
00:49:14.618 --> 00:49:16.120
Thank you.

516
00:49:18.497 --> 00:49:20.916
Hilts, how do you breathe?

517
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.043
We got a steel rod with hinges on it.

518
00:49:23.085 --> 00:49:25.880
We shove it up and make air holes
as we go along. Good night, sir.

519
00:49:33.262 --> 00:49:36.307
Why didn't anybody
think of that before?

520
00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:38.893
It's so stupid
it's positively brilliant!

521
00:49:39.977 --> 00:49:43.063
But it'll bring every goon
in the camp down on top of us.

522
00:49:43.147 --> 00:49:45.483
I don't know.
Perhaps we're being too clever.

523
00:49:45.566 --> 00:49:47.651
If we stop all the breakouts...

524
00:49:47.735 --> 00:49:51.113
it may only convince the goons
that we must be tunneling.

525
00:49:51.197 --> 00:49:52.656
I hope it works.

526
00:49:53.657 --> 00:49:56.744
If it doesn't, they will be
in the cooler for a long time.

527
00:50:42.957 --> 00:50:46.001
- Good, eh?
- Danny, it's bloody beautiful.

528
00:50:52.258 --> 00:50:54.301
This is the dirt
from the compound.

529
00:50:54.385 --> 00:50:56.428
This is from the tunnel.

530
00:51:02.351 --> 00:51:05.479
Wherever we put it, they're going
to spot it a mile away.

531
00:51:05.521 --> 00:51:08.482
Maybe we can put it under the huts.
The dirt's dark there.

532
00:51:08.524 --> 00:51:10.568
No, it's the first place
the ferrets would look.

533
00:51:10.651 --> 00:51:12.570
I saw one measuring the height
under a hut yesterday.

534
00:51:12.653 --> 00:51:14.613
Maybe we could dry it up
the same color.

535
00:51:14.655 --> 00:51:18.993
- We'll have 50 tons of it.
- I was just thinking out loud.

536
00:51:19.034 --> 00:51:21.495
If you must think,
for God's sake, think clearly.

537
00:51:23.372 --> 00:51:25.541
Where the devil is Ashley-Pitt?

538
00:51:27.084 --> 00:51:29.670
We can't destroy the dirt.
We can't eat it.

539
00:51:30.754 --> 00:51:33.841
The only thing left to do
is camouflage it.

540
00:51:33.924 --> 00:51:35.968
That's as far
as my thinking takes me.

541
00:51:37.803 --> 00:51:40.264
Didn't they teach you promptness
in the R.N.?

542
00:51:40.347 --> 00:51:43.267
You'll never believe it,
but I think I have the solution.

543
00:51:43.350 --> 00:51:47.688
The problem is somehow to get rid
of this tunnel dirt over the compound.

544
00:51:47.730 --> 00:51:49.189
Well, of course.

545
00:51:50.441 --> 00:51:52.026
Would you mind?

546
00:52:02.328 --> 00:52:03.746
Now...

547
00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:09.293
you fill these bags
with the dirt from the tunnel.

548
00:52:09.376 --> 00:52:13.088
Then, wearing them
inside your trousers...

549
00:52:13.172 --> 00:52:16.592
you wander out
into the compound, where...

550
00:52:16.675 --> 00:52:19.053
you pull these strings
in your pockets.

551
00:52:20.554 --> 00:52:22.473
Out come the pins.

552
00:52:25.434 --> 00:52:26.977
Eric, it's good.

553
00:52:27.061 --> 00:52:29.647
All you have to do is kick it in.

554
00:52:30.564 --> 00:52:33.359
Unless you're a complete fool,
the ferrets will never see a thing.

555
00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:36.362
It's indecently brilliant.
What do you think, Roger?

556
00:52:36.403 --> 00:52:39.323
- We'll try it tomorrow.
- I already have. It works.

557
00:52:42.534 --> 00:52:45.287
Mac, this is what we'll do.

558
00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:01.428
Present from Tom, sir.

559
00:53:01.512 --> 00:53:03.055
Thank you, Nimmo.

560
00:53:11.689 --> 00:53:14.983
- Nice garden you got, sir.
- Yes, carry on.

561
00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:48.684
All right, let's look sharp!

562
00:53:55.774 --> 00:53:57.109
That looks sharp.

563
00:54:01.655 --> 00:54:03.198
Sir.

564
00:54:06.535 --> 00:54:10.330
Please, gentlemen, continue.
This is merely a routine inspection.

565
00:54:26.138 --> 00:54:28.557
- Good morning, Squadron Leader.
- Good morning, sir.

566
00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:32.811
I am sorry the soil here isn't
better suited to your men's purpose.

567
00:54:32.853 --> 00:54:34.354
We'll manage, sir.

568
00:54:44.239 --> 00:54:48.202
I must say I'm surprised at the extent
of this activity, Group Captain.

569
00:54:48.285 --> 00:54:50.537
Pleased, of course,
but surprised.

570
00:54:50.579 --> 00:54:51.914
Surprised, Colonel?

571
00:54:52.873 --> 00:54:57.085
Fliers are gentlemen,
not peasants to dig in the earth.

572
00:54:57.169 --> 00:54:58.545
So I am surprised.

573
00:54:58.587 --> 00:55:01.131
The English have always been
very keen on gardening.

574
00:55:01.215 --> 00:55:04.760
Yes, but flowers.
Is this not so?

575
00:55:05.677 --> 00:55:07.930
You can't eat flowers, Colonel.

576
00:55:10.224 --> 00:55:11.683
Good point.

577
00:55:29.076 --> 00:55:32.287
I have the nasty feeling
he knows exactly what we're doing.

578
00:55:32.371 --> 00:55:35.749
- Maybe he does.
- You don't really think so?

579
00:55:35.791 --> 00:55:38.210
We'll find out soon enough.

580
00:55:49.972 --> 00:55:52.099
- Morning, Bob.
- Sandy.

581
00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:53.767
Here we are.

582
00:55:53.851 --> 00:55:55.519
Now, let's see.

583
00:55:55.602 --> 00:55:58.063
Biscuits, two packets.

584
00:55:58.105 --> 00:56:00.482
Coffee, two tins.

585
00:56:00.566 --> 00:56:02.860
Bovarro, one jar.

586
00:56:02.943 --> 00:56:05.612
Cigarettes, six packets.

587
00:56:05.696 --> 00:56:07.531
Strawberry jam, Sorren's.

588
00:56:07.614 --> 00:56:10.075
Black currant jam, Cavendish.

589
00:56:10.117 --> 00:56:12.202
And marmalade, mine.

590
00:56:12.286 --> 00:56:16.874
Danish butter, Von Luger's.
I liberated it from his mess supplies.

591
00:56:16.957 --> 00:56:18.709
Oh, yes.

592
00:56:18.792 --> 00:56:22.546
And Dutch chocolate, two bars.

593
00:56:22.629 --> 00:56:25.299
That cleans out the gift boot
for the entire organization.

594
00:56:25.382 --> 00:56:29.219
Now, the first thing we need
is a new form of travel permit.

595
00:56:29.303 --> 00:56:32.347
Forgers don't know what it looks like,
and they can't move without it.

596
00:56:32.431 --> 00:56:35.183
- I'll see what I can do.
- And any other...

597
00:56:35.267 --> 00:56:39.521
identity cards, personal papers,
documents you can put your hands on.

598
00:56:39.605 --> 00:56:40.856
Put them to work.

599
00:56:40.939 --> 00:56:42.941
- Right.
- Good luck.

600
00:56:52.034 --> 00:56:56.288
O come, all ye faithful

601
00:56:56.330 --> 00:56:59.666
Joyful and triumphant

602
00:56:59.708 --> 00:57:01.585
O come ye

603
00:57:01.668 --> 00:57:07.215
O come ye to Bethlehem

604
00:57:07.299 --> 00:57:11.011
Come and behold Him

605
00:57:11.053 --> 00:57:14.348
Born the king of angels

606
00:57:14.389 --> 00:57:18.060
O come let us adore Him

607
00:57:26.234 --> 00:57:28.987
Louie, where the hell
is the air pump?

608
00:57:29.029 --> 00:57:30.989
Patience is a virtue.

609
00:57:31.031 --> 00:57:34.868
I know, dear boy, but the diggers
can only work when the trap's open...

610
00:57:34.952 --> 00:57:37.537
and this is holding us up
very badly.

611
00:57:39.498 --> 00:57:41.541
- Is it finished?
- Of course.

612
00:57:41.583 --> 00:57:44.503
- Why isn't it in?
- Working on the air ducts now.

613
00:57:44.544 --> 00:57:47.881
- When will they be finished?
- One or two days.

614
00:57:47.923 --> 00:57:51.426
- Does it work?
- Of course it works.

615
00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:55.222
- Will it give us enough air?
- It's as much as you'll need.

616
00:57:57.015 --> 00:57:58.266
Excellent.

617
00:57:59.768 --> 00:58:01.395
Have it in by tomorrow night.

618
00:58:13.407 --> 00:58:14.950
Got a light?

619
00:58:18.912 --> 00:58:20.580
Thanks.

620
00:58:20.664 --> 00:58:23.083
- That's pretty, isn't it?
- Yes.

621
00:58:31.174 --> 00:58:33.844
I'm sorry.
Would you like one?

622
00:58:35.762 --> 00:58:39.182
I'll smoke it later
when I'm off duty. Thank you.

623
00:58:39.266 --> 00:58:42.185
You probably have a couple
of roommates, huh?

624
00:58:43.562 --> 00:58:46.356
- Beautiful day.
- Yes.

625
00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:48.734
But I think it might rain later.

626
00:58:50.110 --> 00:58:52.904
"Red sky in the morning,
sailor takes warning.

627
00:58:52.946 --> 00:58:54.906
Red sky at night,
sailor's delight.”

628
00:58:54.948 --> 00:58:57.451
There was a red sky last night.

629
00:58:57.492 --> 00:58:59.453
I never heard that before.

630
00:58:59.536 --> 00:59:01.913
I learned it in the Boy Scouts.

631
00:59:01.955 --> 00:59:04.124
You were a Boy Scout?
So was I.

632
00:59:04.207 --> 00:59:06.626
- Really?
- I had 19 merit badges.

633
00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:08.545
I had 20.

634
00:59:08.628 --> 00:59:12.466
I was working on my 20th when
the government abolished scouting...

635
00:59:12.549 --> 00:59:15.844
and sent me into
the Hitler Youth instead.

636
00:59:19.264 --> 00:59:23.393
Hey, Werner, you think you'll
stay in the army after the war?

637
00:59:23.477 --> 00:59:26.521
Oh, no.
I'm not a well man.

638
00:59:26.605 --> 00:59:29.357
- My teeth.
- Your teeth?

639
00:59:29.441 --> 00:59:33.570
I could tell you stories about my teeth
that would make your hair stand on end.

640
00:59:33.653 --> 00:59:35.906
Our dentist here is a butcher.

641
00:59:37.074 --> 00:59:38.992
But don't tell anyone
I said so.

642
00:59:40.619 --> 00:59:43.246
It's a soldier's right to complain.

643
00:59:43.330 --> 00:59:46.249
Maybe in your army, but here...

644
00:59:46.333 --> 00:59:50.754
one little criticism and...
to the Russian front.

645
00:59:50.837 --> 00:59:52.923
Is that so?

646
00:59:53.006 --> 00:59:54.382
Terrible.

647
00:59:55.217 --> 00:59:57.177
That's terrible.

648
01:00:07.187 --> 01:00:09.648
Let's go to my room
where we can talk more comfortably.

649
01:00:09.689 --> 01:00:13.193
I'd better not.
If Strachwitz should see me--

650
01:00:15.362 --> 01:00:17.697
I was just gonna
make some coffee.

651
01:00:19.908 --> 01:00:22.035
Some real coffee.

652
01:00:50.647 --> 01:00:53.608
Coffee, coffee, coffee.

653
01:00:53.692 --> 01:00:55.610
Where is it?

654
01:00:59.906 --> 01:01:01.575
Marmalade?

655
01:01:01.658 --> 01:01:04.744
My grandmother keeps
sending me this stuff.

656
01:01:08.665 --> 01:01:10.375
Chocolate.

657
01:01:10.417 --> 01:01:12.878
Oh, yeah, here.
Take one.

658
01:01:19.217 --> 01:01:21.011
Von Luger's butter!

659
01:01:21.094 --> 01:01:23.346
Yeah. Keep it.

660
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:26.224
Nein! I must go.

661
01:01:26.266 --> 01:01:28.727
You can keep it.
We're friends.

662
01:01:28.768 --> 01:01:31.980
With you in the cooler, will we still
be friends? I must report this.

663
01:01:32.063 --> 01:01:34.149
I don't understand.
Report what?

664
01:01:34.232 --> 01:01:37.527
That you and I were
chatting in my room?

665
01:01:37.611 --> 01:01:40.488
- I must go.
- It's okay. Keep it.

666
01:01:40.572 --> 01:01:44.075
I'll never be able to eat it.
I've got all I could eat.

667
01:01:44.117 --> 01:01:47.370
I'm sorry.
All right, forget it.

668
01:02:19.653 --> 01:02:23.990
And that, I'm sure you'll remember,
is the voice of the Nellis warbler.

669
01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:27.244
Now let's turn our attention
to this gentleman, the masked shrike...

670
01:02:27.327 --> 01:02:29.579
Lanius nubicas,
the butcher bird.

671
01:02:29.663 --> 01:02:33.708
The shrike impales his foes
on the spikes of thornbushes.

672
01:02:33.792 --> 01:02:35.502
Not a very lovable character.

673
01:02:35.543 --> 01:02:37.629
Let's have a look at the coloring.

674
01:02:37.671 --> 01:02:41.174
Uniform black above
from head to tail.

675
01:02:41.258 --> 01:02:44.094
A black rump, a black crown
with a bold white flash...

676
01:02:44.177 --> 01:02:46.596
and a white line over the eye.

677
01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:49.224
The shrike lives in
lightly-wooded country.

678
01:02:50.558 --> 01:02:53.770
Sit down. You'll find
drawing materials on the table.

679
01:02:53.853 --> 01:02:58.358
The shrike lives in lightly-wooded
country, olive groves and gardens.

680
01:02:58.441 --> 01:03:01.027
Herr Hendley,
have you taken to birds too now?

681
01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:03.822
You should stick around.
You might learn something.

682
01:03:03.863 --> 01:03:07.409
I have better things to do
than draw birds.

683
01:03:07.492 --> 01:03:10.912
The voice is a monotonous succession
of scratchy, complaining notes.

684
01:03:12.831 --> 01:03:16.418
Let's have a good look at this bird.
He's got a good round shape.

685
01:03:36.521 --> 01:03:40.900
Permission to cross the front here.
Here's another one.

686
01:03:40.984 --> 01:03:43.403
Which one's the forgery?

687
01:03:44.654 --> 01:03:46.948
- That one.
- That's right.

688
01:03:47.032 --> 01:03:48.825
They both are.

689
01:03:48.908 --> 01:03:52.495
What's holding us up now
is the new form of this travel permit.

690
01:03:52.579 --> 01:03:55.498
- We have no idea what they look like.
- Here's one.

691
01:03:57.042 --> 01:04:00.420
And a military identity card...

692
01:04:00.503 --> 01:04:02.005
and a--

693
01:04:02.088 --> 01:04:03.757
An aus visa.

694
01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:05.759
Permission to be
on Reich property.

695
01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:07.802
A ticket to Odin and...

696
01:04:07.886 --> 01:04:11.931
what looks like the ferrets' assignments
by day and hour for the next week.

697
01:04:12.015 --> 01:04:15.268
- You get ten out of ten for this.
- Thank you.

698
01:04:15.352 --> 01:04:18.438
- Take good care of that.
- Where did you get this?

699
01:04:19.856 --> 01:04:21.733
It's on loan.

700
01:04:23.443 --> 01:04:26.237
In order to get the right
amount of outfits, Roger...

701
01:04:26.279 --> 01:04:29.824
I suggest that we work
mainly from service uniforms.

702
01:04:29.908 --> 01:04:33.828
Now, I can do double-breasteds,
single-breasteds...

703
01:04:33.912 --> 01:04:36.831
and rather nice lounge suits.

704
01:04:36.915 --> 01:04:39.542
Lapels. I can do a lot
of things with those.

705
01:04:39.626 --> 01:04:42.295
I can have them deep like that...

706
01:04:42.337 --> 01:04:44.798
or high ones like that.

707
01:04:44.839 --> 01:04:49.052
Here's one that
we're working on right now.

708
01:04:49.135 --> 01:04:51.054
What about buttons?

709
01:04:52.389 --> 01:04:54.432
Take a look at those.

710
01:04:54.474 --> 01:04:56.976
Here's one that I finished, Roger.

711
01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:06.653
Here's one that I dyed
with a bottle of blue ink.

712
01:05:06.694 --> 01:05:10.365
Looks rather good.
What's up, Roger?

713
01:05:10.448 --> 01:05:13.368
The goons would have a field day
if they crashed in on this lot.

714
01:05:13.451 --> 01:05:17.997
That's Sorren's department. I've
started working on the other materials.

715
01:05:18.039 --> 01:05:20.125
This blanket...

716
01:05:20.166 --> 01:05:24.587
particularly the striped,
marvelous... coats.

717
01:05:24.671 --> 01:05:27.424
I've got the chaps working on these
all over the compound.

718
01:05:27.507 --> 01:05:30.677
Those battle dresses,
they're a bit too short.

719
01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:35.557
I'll have to get the chaps to make those
into some sort of workingman's outfits.

720
01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:37.851
Blanket ticking.

721
01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:42.313
Now, I've made these into
rather nice little waistcoats.

722
01:05:44.274 --> 01:05:46.443
- Dyed, of course?
- Of course.

723
01:05:46.526 --> 01:05:49.195
Just take a look at this, Roger.

724
01:05:49.279 --> 01:05:51.072
This blanket material...

725
01:05:51.156 --> 01:05:54.534
we scrape this down
until it's really smooth...

726
01:05:54.576 --> 01:05:56.744
and then dye it
with boot polish.

727
01:05:56.828 --> 01:06:00.874
Corduroy scrounged by Hendley.
I wish we had more of this.

728
01:06:00.915 --> 01:06:03.209
Where in God's hame
did you get these from?

729
01:06:03.293 --> 01:06:05.253
- Hendley.
- Where did he get them?

730
01:06:05.336 --> 01:06:07.380
- I asked him that.
- What did he say?

731
01:06:07.422 --> 01:06:11.593
"Don't ask." Let me show you some of
the overcoats I've been working on.

732
01:06:42.248 --> 01:06:44.209
Good morning, Hilts.

733
01:06:45.752 --> 01:06:48.963
If you're here to find out
if I'm going out again, I am.

734
01:06:49.047 --> 01:06:51.132
- When?
- Seventeen days, seventh of July.

735
01:06:51.216 --> 01:06:53.176
- Dark of the moon.
- Correct.

736
01:06:53.259 --> 01:06:55.678
Is Ives going with you?

737
01:06:55.762 --> 01:06:57.430
Yeah, if he wants to.

738
01:06:58.765 --> 01:07:02.101
You know that Ives
is close to cracking?

739
01:07:06.314 --> 01:07:09.901
- Better he goes out in the tunnel?
- Safer.

740
01:07:15.365 --> 01:07:16.783
Right.

741
01:07:18.952 --> 01:07:22.789
Hilts, it's possible for one man to get
out through the wire, even get away...

742
01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:25.333
but there are, in fact...

743
01:07:25.416 --> 01:07:28.378
a considerable number of people
besides yourself...

744
01:07:28.461 --> 01:07:30.797
in this camp
who are trying to escape.

745
01:07:31.881 --> 01:07:33.967
I appreciate that.

746
01:07:36.302 --> 01:07:38.429
Something's coming--
I can feel it--

747
01:07:38.471 --> 01:07:41.224
and it's coming right around
the corner at me, Squadron Leader.

748
01:07:41.307 --> 01:07:44.561
- My name's Roger.
- All right, Roger.

749
01:07:44.644 --> 01:07:46.980
Yours is Virgil, isn't it?

750
01:07:48.022 --> 01:07:50.817
Hilts. Just make it Hilts.

751
01:07:53.736 --> 01:07:57.323
As I was saying, Hilts...

752
01:07:57.365 --> 01:08:00.368
we have maps of Germany;
general maps, that is.

753
01:08:00.451 --> 01:08:04.622
We have all the information that we need
for the escape routes out of Germany...

754
01:08:04.664 --> 01:08:07.667
but what we do not have--

755
01:08:07.709 --> 01:08:10.503
Is a clear idea of what's
500 yards beyond those trees.

756
01:08:10.545 --> 01:08:13.840
Right. We've tried
every goon in the camp. No go.

757
01:08:13.881 --> 01:08:17.343
We must know the exact position
of the local town.

758
01:08:17.427 --> 01:08:20.346
We want to know where we hit
the main roads. They must patrol them.

759
01:08:20.388 --> 01:08:22.348
Where the local
police stations are.

760
01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:25.727
Where they've got military roadblocks,
and most important of all...

761
01:08:25.810 --> 01:08:29.939
we've got to know how to get from here
to the railway station.

762
01:08:31.357 --> 01:08:33.735
No. Absolutely not.

763
01:08:33.818 --> 01:08:37.614
When I get through that wire, I'm not
gonna be making maps for you guys.

764
01:08:37.697 --> 01:08:40.116
I'm gonna be so far away,
you couldn't hear it...

765
01:08:40.199 --> 01:08:42.368
if they were shooting at me
with howitzers.

766
01:08:43.453 --> 01:08:45.288
That's understandable.

767
01:08:45.371 --> 01:08:46.873
Completely.

768
01:08:48.625 --> 01:08:51.044
I mean, I'd like to help, but--

769
01:08:54.672 --> 01:08:58.676
Interesting idea.
How many are you taking out?

770
01:08:58.718 --> 01:09:00.678
Two hundred and fifty.

771
01:09:07.894 --> 01:09:09.896
You're crazy.
You oughta be locked up.

772
01:09:09.937 --> 01:09:13.524
Two hundred and fifty guys just
walking down the road, just like that?

773
01:09:13.566 --> 01:09:16.361
Well, some on the road,
some by train...

774
01:09:16.402 --> 01:09:17.862
some cross country.

775
01:09:17.904 --> 01:09:21.866
They'll have forged papers, clothes,
maps, compasses, rations.

776
01:09:21.908 --> 01:09:25.078
Has it occurred to you that you're
gonna alert every goon in the country?

777
01:09:25.161 --> 01:09:28.081
Anybody that can carry a pitchfork
is gonna be out looking for you.

778
01:09:28.164 --> 01:09:32.418
They're gonna swoop down and scoop you
up so fast, it'd make your head swim.

779
01:09:36.089 --> 01:09:38.007
Well, thanks anyway.

780
01:09:38.091 --> 01:09:40.426
Anything I can do to help
in the tunnel, let me know.

781
01:09:40.468 --> 01:09:43.096
- That's very good of you.
- Anytime.

782
01:09:44.764 --> 01:09:46.849
Wait a minute.

783
01:09:46.933 --> 01:09:50.311
You aren't seriously suggesting
that if I get through the wire...

784
01:09:50.395 --> 01:09:53.314
and case everything out there
and don't get picked up...

785
01:09:53.398 --> 01:09:56.275
to turn myself in
and get thrown back in the cooler...

786
01:09:56.317 --> 01:09:58.778
SO you can get
the information you need?

787
01:09:58.820 --> 01:09:59.904
Yes.

788
01:09:59.946 --> 01:10:03.533
One has to ask some very strange things
in the job I have.

789
01:10:03.616 --> 01:10:06.953
- You'd get a front place in the tunnel.
- I wouldn't do that for my mother.

790
01:10:06.994 --> 01:10:08.996
- I don't blame you.
- Okay then.

791
01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:11.958
- It's completely understandable.
- Okay then.

792
01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:16.212
Thanks, Hilts.

793
01:10:23.886 --> 01:10:25.304
Check.

794
01:10:30.393 --> 01:10:33.104
It's all right.
Blythe's a friend.

795
01:10:35.898 --> 01:10:37.316
What's the matter?

796
01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:40.987
My wallet, my papers,
my identity card, gone.

797
01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:44.115
I lost them, everything.

798
01:10:44.157 --> 01:10:46.117
He lost his wallet.

799
01:10:46.159 --> 01:10:49.620
Do you realize what would happen
if Strachwitz found this out?

800
01:10:49.662 --> 01:10:52.290
- The Russian front.
- Dear, dear.

801
01:10:54.876 --> 01:10:56.836
I've looked everyplace.

802
01:10:58.546 --> 01:11:01.841
I must have lost them
while I was in here.

803
01:11:04.761 --> 01:11:09.098
I told you we were friends.
We'll find them.

804
01:11:09.182 --> 01:11:11.100
Thank you, Herr Hendley.

805
01:11:14.228 --> 01:11:17.440
Not now. It might look
a little peculiar...

806
01:11:17.523 --> 01:11:20.359
if you and I were seen probing around
at this time of night.

807
01:11:22.153 --> 01:11:23.863
Look, I'll find them.

808
01:11:23.946 --> 01:11:27.366
I promise you, I'll find them
if I have to tear this room apart.

809
01:11:34.081 --> 01:11:36.250
- Thank you.
- Forget it.

810
01:11:38.419 --> 01:11:40.671
There is one small favor.

811
01:11:40.713 --> 01:11:42.006
A camera.

812
01:11:44.717 --> 01:11:48.179
We want to take some snapshots.
You know, keepsakes.

813
01:11:49.555 --> 01:11:53.684
Thirty-five millimeter
with 2.8 lens and a plane shutter.

814
01:11:53.726 --> 01:11:55.353
Focal plane shutter.

815
01:11:58.815 --> 01:12:02.193
That's a focal plane shutter.

816
01:12:02.235 --> 01:12:04.111
Let me know when you got it.

817
01:12:09.242 --> 01:12:11.744
He's a crazy, mixed-up kid,
that Werner...

818
01:12:11.786 --> 01:12:13.663
but I like him.

819
01:12:13.746 --> 01:12:15.331
Checkmate.

820
01:12:39.856 --> 01:12:43.442
- When will that air pump be ready?
- I'll have it for you tomorrow.

821
01:12:43.526 --> 01:12:47.321
You're badly behind schedule, Sedgwick.
How's it coming, Danny?

822
01:12:47.405 --> 01:12:50.616
No good.
Today, three times.

823
01:13:08.050 --> 01:13:09.969
You all right?
Pull!

824
01:13:40.458 --> 01:13:45.630
You're gonna have to shore up the whole
bloody tunnel, Roger, all 335 feet.

825
01:13:45.671 --> 01:13:48.507
Four times today.

826
01:13:48.549 --> 01:13:52.762
This way we never get through.
We must have more wood.

827
01:13:53.721 --> 01:13:55.681
That's a lot of timber.

828
01:13:55.723 --> 01:13:57.683
Can you get it?

829
01:13:59.936 --> 01:14:03.856
We'll get it.
We've gotta get it.

830
01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:07.443
I'll put Hendley on it,
and the new man we got this morning.

831
01:14:08.611 --> 01:14:10.279
Okay, Willie.

832
01:14:10.363 --> 01:14:13.866
On the first day of Christmas
my true love sent to me

833
01:14:13.908 --> 01:14:16.369
A partridge in a pear tree

834
01:14:23.709 --> 01:14:27.338
On the fourth day of Christmas
my true love sent to me

835
01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:29.632
Four calling birds
three French hens

836
01:14:29.715 --> 01:14:33.719
Two turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree

837
01:14:33.803 --> 01:14:37.264
On the fifth day of Christmas
my true love sent to me

838
01:14:37.348 --> 01:14:40.226
Five gold rings

839
01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:43.229
How's it going
with the rafters?

840
01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:45.439
Taking out 24.

841
01:14:50.987 --> 01:14:52.238
Stay with it.

842
01:15:34.238 --> 01:15:37.575
Bloody singing. I've never worked
so hard in all my life. Hi, Hilts.

843
01:15:37.616 --> 01:15:39.243
Say, Cavendish--

844
01:15:43.122 --> 01:15:44.665
Alley-oop!

845
01:15:51.630 --> 01:15:53.215
Never mind.

846
01:16:03.517 --> 01:16:06.395
Here's a present
from our friend Werner.

847
01:16:06.479 --> 01:16:10.316
Splendid. Simply splendid.

848
01:16:11.317 --> 01:16:13.986
This should do very nicely.

849
01:16:16.947 --> 01:16:18.866
Those are Ashley-Pitt's men.

850
01:16:18.949 --> 01:16:22.369
He requested permission to dispose
of some of his dirt in our attic.

851
01:17:31.272 --> 01:17:35.568
Tom has reached just beyond
that pile of wood, sir.

852
01:17:35.651 --> 01:17:37.903
Harry, of course,
isn't as far as that.

853
01:17:37.945 --> 01:17:39.947
How much further to the trees?

854
01:17:40.030 --> 01:17:42.074
We make it 50 feet, sir.

855
01:17:42.158 --> 01:17:45.661
- Dark of the moon is the seventh--
- Eighth and ninth.

856
01:17:45.744 --> 01:17:47.663
A day earlier in August.

857
01:17:54.086 --> 01:17:55.504
Morning.

858
01:17:56.755 --> 01:17:58.757
There he goes again.

859
01:17:58.841 --> 01:18:01.427
Why's he piling up
all the potatoes in the camp?

860
01:18:01.468 --> 01:18:04.430
I've been working on that,
but I can't find out.

861
01:18:04.471 --> 01:18:07.099
Hilts and Hendley lock themselves
in their room every night.

862
01:18:07.183 --> 01:18:10.603
Sometimes Goff's in there with them.
Other nights he's on guard outside.

863
01:18:10.644 --> 01:18:14.690
Mac, we'll close down Dick and Harry,
seal them off.

864
01:18:14.773 --> 01:18:17.776
Put the entire effort into Tom
and press right on into the trees.

865
01:18:17.818 --> 01:18:19.278
Right, Roger.

866
01:19:07.243 --> 01:19:08.661
Wow.

867
01:20:52.473 --> 01:20:53.807
About face!

868
01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:56.852
Forward march!

869
01:21:03.942 --> 01:21:05.778
What is it?

870
01:21:05.819 --> 01:21:08.322
They're celebrating the Revolution.

871
01:21:08.405 --> 01:21:10.324
It's the Fourth of July.

872
01:21:19.792 --> 01:21:21.543
What the devil's this?

873
01:21:24.963 --> 01:21:27.216
Company, halt!

874
01:21:27.299 --> 01:21:29.760
Gentlemen, you're invited for
free drinks at the wash deck.

875
01:21:29.802 --> 01:21:32.012
A little present from the colonials.

876
01:21:32.096 --> 01:21:34.681
- Down the British.
- Quite right.

877
01:21:34.765 --> 01:21:38.519
- And a little drink to Tom.
- And to getting home.

878
01:21:38.602 --> 01:21:41.063
Very well. We accept.
Up the rebels.

879
01:21:41.146 --> 01:21:43.649
- Down the British.
- If you care to follow us.

880
01:21:43.690 --> 01:21:45.567
About face!

881
01:21:45.651 --> 01:21:47.569
Column, left! March!

882
01:22:05.295 --> 01:22:06.588
Company, halt!

883
01:22:11.093 --> 01:22:12.511
Let's line up.

884
01:22:26.275 --> 01:22:29.194
That explains
what happened to the potatoes.

885
01:22:29.236 --> 01:22:32.030
No harm in closing down Tom
for one day, Roger.

886
01:22:32.072 --> 01:22:34.950
I suppose it'll do us all good
to let off a bit of steam.

887
01:22:35.033 --> 01:22:39.037
There's only 14 feet to go.
We can draw out the whole bloody camp.

888
01:22:39.121 --> 01:22:42.249
- That calls for a drink.
- Hear, hear, sir.

889
01:22:42.332 --> 01:22:44.543
Drink it up.

890
01:22:44.585 --> 01:22:48.046
Moonshine. American moonshine.
Moonshine.

891
01:22:48.130 --> 01:22:50.674
- Cheers, Hendley.
- Drink it all.

892
01:22:50.716 --> 01:22:52.259
Keep it moving.

893
01:22:52.342 --> 01:22:55.262
Hello, Eric.
Don't spill any of that.

894
01:22:55.345 --> 01:22:57.973
- There you go.
- Down with the British.

895
01:22:58.056 --> 01:23:01.435
All right, old timer.
Keep it moving.

896
01:23:01.518 --> 01:23:03.854
Don't get any on your clothes.

897
01:23:03.896 --> 01:23:06.148
Don't get any on your clothes.

898
01:23:07.274 --> 01:23:09.526
- Before your morning tea?
- Tonic water.

899
01:23:09.568 --> 01:23:11.612
Keep it moving.

900
01:23:11.695 --> 01:23:15.032
Don't get any on your clothes, sir.
American moonshine.

901
01:23:15.073 --> 01:23:17.409
Don't smoke right after you drink it.

902
01:23:17.493 --> 01:23:20.412
No smoking.
No smoking while you're drinking.

903
01:23:35.427 --> 01:23:37.804
Get good and stoned, my friend.

904
01:23:39.473 --> 01:23:41.642
Keep it going.
Keep it--

905
01:23:42.726 --> 01:23:46.146
No taxation without representation.

906
01:23:46.230 --> 01:23:48.649
Keep it going, boys.
Keep it--

907
01:23:50.150 --> 01:23:52.694
Keep it going.
Enjoy yourselves.

908
01:23:52.778 --> 01:23:55.322
Well, let's drink to Tom.

909
01:24:04.039 --> 01:24:06.750
In the three years,
seven months...

910
01:24:06.792 --> 01:24:09.086
and approximately two weeks
that I've been in the bag...

911
01:24:09.127 --> 01:24:11.713
that's the most extraordinary stuff
I've ever tasted.

912
01:24:11.797 --> 01:24:13.757
It's shattering.

913
01:24:13.799 --> 01:24:15.884
I think it's rather good.

914
01:24:17.886 --> 01:24:21.473
Well, with your permission, sir,
I think I'll "all an kaye."

915
01:24:22.808 --> 01:24:24.393
Call an aye.

916
01:24:44.621 --> 01:24:46.707
You know what that is?

917
01:24:46.790 --> 01:24:49.001
I'll tell you what it isn't.

918
01:24:49.084 --> 01:24:51.503
It isn't Napoleon brandy.

919
01:24:52.838 --> 01:24:54.798
How do you like it, sir?

920
01:24:55.841 --> 01:24:57.843
Well, it's--

921
01:24:57.926 --> 01:24:59.928
To the colonies.

922
01:25:00.012 --> 01:25:01.513
Independence.

923
01:25:07.686 --> 01:25:12.024
How are you managing over there
without us? Getting along all right?

924
01:25:12.065 --> 01:25:15.277
We seem to be getting along
all right, sure-- sir.

925
01:25:23.285 --> 01:25:25.203
Yes, well, it's--

926
01:25:26.997 --> 01:25:28.415
It's good stuff, Hilts.

927
01:25:31.376 --> 01:25:33.211
Thank you, sir.

928
01:25:53.565 --> 01:25:55.817
Danny, here's to--

929
01:26:04.242 --> 01:26:06.370
Goons in 105.

930
01:26:06.411 --> 01:26:08.872
- Who?
- Strachwitz.

931
01:26:11.667 --> 01:26:15.962
We have to ignore it. If we pay any
heed, they'll know the hut's important.

932
01:26:17.631 --> 01:26:19.591
Here's to going home.

933
01:26:34.606 --> 01:26:37.818
Come on, Danny.
They've searched it a hundred times.

934
01:26:37.901 --> 01:26:39.319
Home.

935
01:26:52.582 --> 01:26:56.294
I'm glad we've got you
in the tunnel with us. To Tom.

936
01:26:59.005 --> 01:27:03.135
Never mind. You'll be walking down
Gale Street in a couple of weeks.

937
01:27:03.176 --> 01:27:04.761
To Tom.

938
01:27:04.803 --> 01:27:07.889
You know, I'm just beginning
to realize that myself.

939
01:27:07.973 --> 01:27:11.101
Why shouldn't you, man?
We're nearly at the trees, boy.

940
01:27:11.143 --> 01:27:13.311
We're nearly at the trees, eh?

941
01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:45.779
Oh, my God!
They've found Tom!

942
01:28:59.709 --> 01:29:01.628
It's the tunnel.

943
01:29:18.478 --> 01:29:20.105
Success!

944
01:30:59.079 --> 01:31:01.873
Let me know
the exact information you need.

945
01:31:01.915 --> 01:31:04.626
- I'm going out tonight.
- Right.

946
01:31:06.711 --> 01:31:08.838
Open up Harry.

947
01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:11.716
We dig around the clock.

948
01:32:49.731 --> 01:32:51.399
Cooler.

949
01:32:51.483 --> 01:32:52.901
Right.

950
01:32:56.780 --> 01:33:00.033
I didn't think
they'd catch him so soon.

951
01:33:00.116 --> 01:33:02.285
He wasn't caught.

952
01:33:15.924 --> 01:33:18.051
Hilts, welcome home.

953
01:34:27.871 --> 01:34:29.873
Are you all right, Danny?

954
01:34:33.918 --> 01:34:35.503
All right.

955
01:34:37.964 --> 01:34:41.176
All right.
Bring some shovels. I'm all right.

956
01:34:43.678 --> 01:34:46.264
For God's sakes, Smithy,
you've left out a whole bloody eagle.

957
01:34:46.347 --> 01:34:47.932
That's impossible.

958
01:34:52.103 --> 01:34:54.355
Four days' work
up the bloody spout!

959
01:34:56.149 --> 01:34:58.443
I'm sorry, Collin.

960
01:34:58.484 --> 01:35:00.445
It's all right, Smithy.

961
01:35:01.571 --> 01:35:05.366
It's getting late.
You push off to bed. I'll pack up.

962
01:35:05.450 --> 01:35:07.452
All right.

963
01:35:07.535 --> 01:35:10.288
- Good night, Collin.
- Good night, Smithy.

964
01:35:50.578 --> 01:35:52.830
I can't see a bloody thing.

965
01:36:09.764 --> 01:36:11.182
Heil Hitler.

966
01:36:20.858 --> 01:36:23.361
- Your German's very good.
- Thanks, Mac.

967
01:36:23.444 --> 01:36:25.446
I've put in a lot of--

968
01:36:25.530 --> 01:36:29.867
It's the easiest way to trip up
a suspect. Don't fall for that old gag.

969
01:36:29.951 --> 01:36:32.870
- Remember, German always.
- Righto.

970
01:36:45.591 --> 01:36:49.679
One, two, three, four, five.

971
01:37:15.330 --> 01:37:16.789
No, it's me.

972
01:37:19.250 --> 01:37:21.252
How do you like
the old escape suit?

973
01:37:21.336 --> 01:37:22.962
Fine, Collin.

974
01:37:30.011 --> 01:37:31.721
How do you like mine?

975
01:37:31.763 --> 01:37:33.973
It looks splendid.

976
01:38:01.125 --> 01:38:03.378
Where are you going?
You'll get yourself shot.

977
01:38:03.461 --> 01:38:06.964
- What's the matter with you?
- I'm going out through that fence.

978
01:38:09.300 --> 01:38:12.887
Danny, we're getting out through
the tunnel. We're almost clear.

979
01:38:12.970 --> 01:38:15.723
Please, Willie, let me alone.

980
01:38:15.807 --> 01:38:18.601
I can't go
in that tunnel anymore...

981
01:38:18.643 --> 01:38:21.020
so I'm going out
through the wire.

982
01:38:24.941 --> 01:38:28.486
Think. We're getting out,
but not through the wire.

983
01:38:28.528 --> 01:38:31.697
We're getting out through the tunnel.
It's finished.

984
01:38:31.781 --> 01:38:33.199
I go out now.

985
01:38:34.826 --> 01:38:38.871
Danny, you go through that wire
and you'll get killed.

986
01:38:45.670 --> 01:38:47.630
Don't do that.

987
01:38:53.469 --> 01:38:55.680
Since I was a boy...

988
01:38:55.763 --> 01:38:58.724
I hate and feared...

989
01:38:58.808 --> 01:39:02.395
little rooms, closets, caves.

990
01:39:02.478 --> 01:39:04.814
You've dug 17 tunnels.

991
01:39:04.856 --> 01:39:07.608
Because I must get out.

992
01:39:07.692 --> 01:39:10.653
I hide the fear
and I dig.

993
01:39:11.779 --> 01:39:15.950
But tomorrow night in the tunnel
with all those men...

994
01:39:16.033 --> 01:39:18.703
I'm afraid maybe this time
I will lose my head...

995
01:39:18.786 --> 01:39:21.330
and ruin the escape
for everybody.

996
01:39:24.125 --> 01:39:26.043
So I go now.

997
01:39:30.882 --> 01:39:33.926
Danny, I'll see you
through the tunnel.

998
01:39:35.470 --> 01:39:38.556
I'll look after you.
I'll stick with you all the way.

999
01:39:40.057 --> 01:39:41.684
All right.

1000
01:39:50.610 --> 01:39:53.196
- Good evening.
- Hello, Roger.

1001
01:39:53.237 --> 01:39:55.865
Well, how do you think we look?

1002
01:39:59.577 --> 01:40:02.997
- It's as bad as all that?
- Collin, I--

1003
01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:07.960
I want first of all to say that without
you, we would not have been ready.

1004
01:40:08.044 --> 01:40:10.379
That's all right.
I had lots of help.

1005
01:40:10.421 --> 01:40:12.548
Lots of very good help.

1006
01:40:13.633 --> 01:40:15.968
What's the matter, Roger?

1007
01:40:16.052 --> 01:40:17.386
You can't go.

1008
01:40:18.930 --> 01:40:20.223
What do you mean?

1009
01:40:20.264 --> 01:40:22.600
- I can't allow it.
- Why?

1010
01:40:22.683 --> 01:40:25.603
Because you can't see
your hand in front of your face.

1011
01:40:25.645 --> 01:40:27.647
You'll be caught
before you got ten yards.

1012
01:40:27.730 --> 01:40:29.899
That's ridiculous.

1013
01:40:31.192 --> 01:40:32.443
Ridiculous.

1014
01:40:32.527 --> 01:40:35.071
I never heard anything
so absurd in my life.

1015
01:40:35.112 --> 01:40:39.033
I can see perfectly.
I can see perfectly!

1016
01:40:39.116 --> 01:40:43.329
I can see that pin down there.
Does that satisfy you?

1017
01:40:43.412 --> 01:40:45.331
What pin? Where?

1018
01:40:57.009 --> 01:41:00.304
Collin, do you see
the foot of the door?

1019
01:41:01.430 --> 01:41:02.848
Of course.

1020
01:41:04.934 --> 01:41:06.852
Put the pin down there.

1021
01:41:08.145 --> 01:41:09.689
All right.

1022
01:41:16.445 --> 01:41:18.364
Come on. Sit down.

1023
01:41:19.949 --> 01:41:23.786
Sit down.
It was a good try.

1024
01:41:23.828 --> 01:41:27.832
I hate these last-minute letdowns,
but I've only just been told.

1025
01:41:27.915 --> 01:41:29.542
It's too risky for you.

1026
01:41:29.625 --> 01:41:31.544
Don't you think
that's Collin's decision?

1027
01:41:31.627 --> 01:41:34.839
- No, I don't.
- Come on, Roger.

1028
01:41:34.922 --> 01:41:39.510
We all know the score here.
At least most of us do.

1029
01:41:39.552 --> 01:41:42.972
Your idea of this escape
is to start another front...

1030
01:41:43.014 --> 01:41:46.392
to foul up the Germans
behind the lines, and that's fine.

1031
01:41:46.475 --> 01:41:48.936
But once we get past
that barbed wire...

1032
01:41:49.020 --> 01:41:52.023
once we have them looking
all over Germany for us...

1033
01:41:52.106 --> 01:41:54.483
that mission is accomplished.

1034
01:41:54.525 --> 01:41:57.903
Afterwards,
we have some ideas of our own.

1035
01:41:58.946 --> 01:42:02.325
You mean, getting home?
Back to your family and children?

1036
01:42:02.366 --> 01:42:03.492
That's right.

1037
01:42:03.534 --> 01:42:07.079
Do you really believe
I haven't thought about that too?

1038
01:42:07.163 --> 01:42:09.081
I'm sure you have.

1039
01:42:10.082 --> 01:42:12.918
I know Collin has.

1040
01:42:13.002 --> 01:42:15.296
And, Roger, I have too.

1041
01:42:15.379 --> 01:42:17.590
We think we can
make it all the way.

1042
01:42:17.673 --> 01:42:22.345
Not Collin. He'd be an appalling hazard
to the whole escape. That's my decision.

1043
01:42:22.386 --> 01:42:26.557
You want to talk about hazard?
Let's talk about you.

1044
01:42:26.599 --> 01:42:30.561
You're the biggest hazard we have.
The Gestapo has you marked.

1045
01:42:32.104 --> 01:42:34.440
No one has said you can't go.

1046
01:42:35.941 --> 01:42:38.486
That's true.

1047
01:42:38.569 --> 01:42:41.072
And I have thought
about the Gestapo.

1048
01:42:42.948 --> 01:42:47.119
But if you're asking me how far
a commanding officer is allowed to go...

1049
01:42:47.203 --> 01:42:49.955
or dare go...

1050
01:42:50.039 --> 01:42:52.458
or should be permitted
to play God...

1051
01:42:53.959 --> 01:42:56.253
I can't answer you.

1052
01:42:57.254 --> 01:42:59.131
But I can tell you...

1053
01:42:59.215 --> 01:43:03.594
a blind man is an unnecessary hazard
not only to himself but to the plan...

1054
01:43:03.678 --> 01:43:06.389
and must therefore
be eliminated from the operation.

1055
01:43:17.441 --> 01:43:20.486
Collin's not a blind man
as long as he's with me...

1056
01:43:20.569 --> 01:43:22.613
and he's going with me.

1057
01:43:28.452 --> 01:43:29.870
It's all right with you?

1058
01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:35.960
Oh, yes. Quite.

1059
01:43:43.134 --> 01:43:45.136
Very well.

1060
01:43:45.219 --> 01:43:49.014
I'll arrange for your escape numbers
to be altered accordingly.

1061
01:43:49.849 --> 01:43:51.809
Good night, gentlemen.

1062
01:43:58.733 --> 01:44:00.151
Actually...

1063
01:44:01.819 --> 01:44:03.946
he's quite right.

1064
01:44:03.988 --> 01:44:06.657
He's completely right.

1065
01:44:06.741 --> 01:44:08.784
I really shouldn't go at all.

1066
01:44:08.826 --> 01:44:12.329
My eyes have been getting
worse and worse lately.

1067
01:44:12.371 --> 01:44:15.499
I think they call it
"progressive myopia."

1068
01:44:16.834 --> 01:44:19.503
I can see things up here, close to.

1069
01:44:19.587 --> 01:44:22.506
I can see to work, but...

1070
01:44:24.842 --> 01:44:26.302
you're just a blur.

1071
01:44:27.386 --> 01:44:28.763
I know.

1072
01:44:30.264 --> 01:44:33.976
Hell, we'll make it in great shape.
Collin, do you have any tea?

1073
01:44:36.103 --> 01:44:39.398
- Yes, of course.
- Then let's have some.

1074
01:44:40.357 --> 01:44:42.026
Splendid.

1075
01:45:01.003 --> 01:45:02.171
Out.

1076
01:45:28.113 --> 01:45:29.573
Hi, Hilts.

1077
01:45:30.366 --> 01:45:31.784
Hey, Mac.

1078
01:45:34.578 --> 01:45:36.205
When?

1079
01:45:36.247 --> 01:45:38.916
Tonight. We thought
they'd never let you out.

1080
01:45:38.958 --> 01:45:41.502
Me too.
Let's get at it.

1081
01:45:41.585 --> 01:45:44.004
- Bartlett's waiting for you.
- I'll be there.

1082
01:46:55.576 --> 01:46:56.827
What time?

1083
01:46:59.163 --> 01:47:01.123
Only eight minutes now, Danny.

1084
01:47:04.627 --> 01:47:06.295
Are you okay?

1085
01:47:17.348 --> 01:47:19.391
Cavendish.

1086
01:47:19.475 --> 01:47:21.894
Griffith, down there. Goff.

1087
01:47:42.498 --> 01:47:44.750
Smith, Foles...

1088
01:47:44.833 --> 01:47:46.752
third on the right.

1089
01:47:46.835 --> 01:47:49.672
Blythe, Hendley,
third on the left.

1090
01:48:19.702 --> 01:48:21.161
There are the lights.

1091
01:48:22.579 --> 01:48:24.331
Right on the tick.

1092
01:48:34.425 --> 01:48:36.051
Look down the tunnel.

1093
01:48:36.093 --> 01:48:38.429
It's lovely.

1094
01:48:40.222 --> 01:48:43.767
It's just like Blackpool
at the height of the season.

1095
01:48:45.519 --> 01:48:47.604
You ever been to Blackpool, Danny?

1096
01:48:52.901 --> 01:48:54.695
I don't know.

1097
01:48:58.073 --> 01:48:59.324
It's time.

1098
01:49:12.629 --> 01:49:16.050
Bartlett, MacDonald, Ashley-Pitt.

1099
01:49:19.720 --> 01:49:21.305
It's all clear, sir.

1100
01:49:30.147 --> 01:49:32.107
We're all set, Roger.

1101
01:49:46.455 --> 01:49:48.332
Good luck.

1102
01:50:19.238 --> 01:50:21.448
They're coming down
the shaft now, Danny...

1103
01:50:21.532 --> 01:50:24.535
and then they'll be coming
right up the tunnel.

1104
01:50:31.542 --> 01:50:35.462
Willie, I can't wait till it's over.

1105
01:50:35.546 --> 01:50:37.047
I must get out.

1106
01:51:09.121 --> 01:51:10.914
What's the matter?

1107
01:51:10.956 --> 01:51:12.416
Danny, come here!

1108
01:51:13.917 --> 01:51:16.336
Danny and I will go later.
We'll take another place.

1109
01:51:16.420 --> 01:51:19.089
Tell me what this is,
and tell me quickly!

1110
01:51:19.173 --> 01:51:21.425
This tunnel is mine
as much as anybody.

1111
01:51:21.508 --> 01:51:24.595
I dug it, I built it,
I was buried many times.

1112
01:51:24.636 --> 01:51:27.598
I go when I want.
Let me out.

1113
01:51:31.268 --> 01:51:33.395
Take him out, Willie.
Take him out!

1114
01:51:48.619 --> 01:51:50.746
Danny, what is it?

1115
01:51:50.787 --> 01:51:53.040
What's going on?

1116
01:51:53.123 --> 01:51:55.792
It's all right, Sedgwick.
We're going later.

1117
01:52:03.467 --> 01:52:05.802
Danny, it's all right.

1118
01:52:05.844 --> 01:52:08.805
We can take another place
in the line. It's all right.

1119
01:52:09.765 --> 01:52:12.768
All right, Collin.
Down you go.

1120
01:52:12.809 --> 01:52:14.394
Now sit down.

1121
01:52:14.478 --> 01:52:17.689
Feel the top rung of the ladder
with your right foot. Got it?

1122
01:52:17.773 --> 01:52:19.191
Down you go.

1123
01:52:34.998 --> 01:52:37.042
Danny cut out, huh?

1124
01:52:37.125 --> 01:52:39.836
Willie took him up top.
Hilts, I--

1125
01:52:52.975 --> 01:52:55.894
- Remember, keep your head down.
- Right.

1126
01:54:01.710 --> 01:54:03.628
All right?

1127
01:54:03.712 --> 01:54:05.797
Hold onto yourself.
You're 20-feet short.

1128
01:54:05.881 --> 01:54:07.883
What do you mean,
"20-feet short"?

1129
01:54:07.924 --> 01:54:10.719
You're 20-feet short of the woods.
The hole is in the open.

1130
01:54:10.761 --> 01:54:12.971
The guard is between us
and the lights.

1131
01:54:13.055 --> 01:54:15.098
How could that happen?
The survey took--

1132
01:54:15.140 --> 01:54:17.059
What difference does it make?
It's happened!

1133
01:54:33.367 --> 01:54:35.369
Damn it, Mac!
I'm trying to think!

1134
01:54:36.661 --> 01:54:38.663
We could postpone it
till we dig to the trees.

1135
01:54:38.747 --> 01:54:41.750
All the documents are dated today.
It's now or never.

1136
01:54:45.921 --> 01:54:49.299
One chance. When the guard goes
to the far end of the compound...

1137
01:54:49.341 --> 01:54:51.301
you might be able
to move your men out.

1138
01:54:51.343 --> 01:54:53.678
I can make it to the woods,
signal when you're clear.

1139
01:54:54.846 --> 01:54:57.182
- What about the towers?
- You'll have to take a chance.

1140
01:54:57.265 --> 01:54:59.976
They're gonna be watching the compound,
not the woods.

1141
01:55:04.272 --> 01:55:06.817
Mac, pass the word.
Send down 30 feet of rope.

1142
01:55:07.651 --> 01:55:09.361
Send down 30 feet of rope!

1143
01:55:10.987 --> 01:55:13.698
Send down 30 feet of rope.

1144
01:55:15.450 --> 01:55:17.452
Send down 30 feet of rope.

1145
01:55:19.121 --> 01:55:22.040
- What do they want that for?
- How should I know? Get the rope.

1146
01:55:37.848 --> 01:55:41.143
- How's it going, Tommy?
- Some kind of foul-up, I think, sir.

1147
01:55:42.352 --> 01:55:45.355
- Have they moved into the tunnel yet?
- I don't think so, sir.

1148
01:56:08.962 --> 01:56:10.547
He's over there.

1149
01:56:16.970 --> 01:56:19.055
All right.
You go first, Eric.

1150
01:56:20.056 --> 01:56:22.058
I'm staying here
till we get moving.

1151
01:56:33.653 --> 01:56:35.947
- See you in Piccadilly.
- Scott's Bar.

1152
01:56:36.031 --> 01:56:37.824
Right.

1153
01:56:50.587 --> 01:56:51.963
Thank you.

1154
01:56:52.047 --> 01:56:54.633
- Good luck.
- Right.

1155
01:57:18.907 --> 01:57:20.325
We're moving.

1156
01:57:27.457 --> 01:57:30.460
They're moving through the tunnel now.
They're getting out.

1157
01:57:34.297 --> 01:57:36.341
Danny, when Warsaw fell...

1158
01:57:36.424 --> 01:57:39.803
you escaped and came to England
because you're a flier.

1159
01:57:39.886 --> 01:57:42.931
You came because you wanted to fly
with us and fight the Germans.

1160
01:57:44.266 --> 01:57:47.310
We can get out now.
We can get back to England.

1161
01:57:49.229 --> 01:57:51.481
Danny, if you don't go
through that tunnel...

1162
01:57:51.565 --> 01:57:54.484
everything you've done
will have been for nothing!

1163
01:58:23.972 --> 01:58:25.974
- Blythe behind, Mac.
- Right.

1164
01:58:28.518 --> 01:58:30.895
- In here, Collin.
- Come on.

1165
01:58:30.979 --> 01:58:32.564
Sit down.

1166
01:58:37.736 --> 01:58:39.904
You're up, Sedgwick.
I'll take over.

1167
01:58:43.658 --> 01:58:45.577
Have you got a piano in here?

1168
01:58:45.660 --> 01:58:47.704
That's very funny, mate.

1169
01:58:47.746 --> 01:58:50.415
- You won't get this thing through.
- I'll cope.

1170
01:58:53.585 --> 01:58:55.920
Was that Sedgwick
with his steamer trunk?

1171
01:58:56.004 --> 01:58:59.090
- Who else?
- I wish he was home with his kangaroos.

1172
01:59:05.972 --> 01:59:07.891
- We're 20-feet short.
- How the hell--

1173
01:59:07.974 --> 01:59:11.811
We're 20-feet short. Hilts is on the
other end of that rope, in the woods.

1174
01:59:11.895 --> 01:59:15.273
When you feel a few tugs, off you go,
but keep Collin low going across.

1175
01:59:15.357 --> 01:59:16.566
Right.

1176
01:59:17.609 --> 01:59:19.569
- Good luck, Collin.
- Thanks, Mac.

1177
01:59:29.412 --> 01:59:30.622
What's that?

1178
01:59:32.123 --> 01:59:33.458
It's an air raid.

1179
01:59:33.541 --> 01:59:35.210
Oh, God, no!

1180
01:59:35.251 --> 01:59:37.837
The goons will pull the switches.
We'll lose the lights in the tunnel.

1181
01:59:38.963 --> 01:59:41.257
Come on. We can get out
when the lights go down.

1182
01:59:59.984 --> 02:00:02.612
It's an air raid!
Searchlights are out! Come on!

1183
02:00:09.494 --> 02:00:10.954
Get 'em out!

1184
02:00:16.626 --> 02:00:18.628
It's gonna cave!

1185
02:00:18.712 --> 02:00:21.005
Danny, it's all right.

1186
02:00:21.089 --> 02:00:23.299
It's the lights.

1187
02:00:24.092 --> 02:00:26.302
Light the fat lamps down there!

1188
02:00:27.512 --> 02:00:30.598
There's been an air raid.
They cut the lights.

1189
02:00:30.640 --> 02:00:33.393
In the tunnel, it's all right.
Listen to me.

1190
02:00:35.228 --> 02:00:36.646
Danny, look.

1191
02:00:40.400 --> 02:00:42.902
Come on, fellas. Move!

1192
02:00:42.986 --> 02:00:45.071
We can get dozens out
in this darkness!

1193
02:00:51.828 --> 02:00:54.038
What the hell's going on?

1194
02:00:54.122 --> 02:00:56.458
- You go.
- No, Danny.

1195
02:00:57.584 --> 02:00:59.669
I'm all right. Go.

1196
02:01:08.178 --> 02:01:10.305
- What is it?
- I brought Danny back.

1197
02:01:10.346 --> 02:01:12.515
- Is he stuck?
- No, he's all right.

1198
02:01:12.557 --> 02:01:14.851
Well, get him out, fast!

1199
02:01:17.353 --> 02:01:19.314
Come on!

1200
02:01:21.733 --> 02:01:23.359
Come on. Move!

1201
02:01:40.001 --> 02:01:41.252
Go.

1202
02:01:47.884 --> 02:01:49.677
Give me your bag.

1203
02:01:56.559 --> 02:01:58.228
We're on the rope!

1204
02:02:43.773 --> 02:02:47.360
We had better get out of here,
or we won't catch any of the trains.

1205
02:02:47.443 --> 02:02:50.446
It's moving. We'll pass
the instructions from man to man.

1206
02:02:52.574 --> 02:02:54.492
- Right.
- I'll be right behind you.

1207
02:03:41.247 --> 02:03:43.499
Come on. Come on.

1208
02:04:02.268 --> 02:04:03.478
Come on.

1209
02:04:21.955 --> 02:04:23.623
- Hey!
- Don't shoot!

1210
02:04:24.374 --> 02:04:26.292
Don't shoot!

1211
02:04:26.376 --> 02:04:27.919
Don't shoot!

1212
02:04:33.174 --> 02:04:35.301
Get out!
They're coming back!

1213
02:04:58.574 --> 02:05:01.577
Oh, boy! There's a lot of shooting
going on up there.

1214
02:05:01.661 --> 02:05:04.163
You think they've been shooting them
one by one as they came out?

1215
02:05:04.247 --> 02:05:06.749
It couldn't be. We would've
heard the shots before.

1216
02:05:09.585 --> 02:05:11.713
- Pull!
- Wait for me.

1217
02:05:11.754 --> 02:05:13.172
Don't worry.

1218
02:05:18.094 --> 02:05:19.554
Out!

1219
02:05:40.950 --> 02:05:42.201
Out.

1220
02:06:16.736 --> 02:06:18.821
- How many did he say?
- Seventy-six.

1221
02:06:18.863 --> 02:06:20.948
- Seventy-six.
- Seventy-six.

1222
02:06:35.797 --> 02:06:36.881
Dismissed.

1223
02:06:36.964 --> 02:06:38.549
Atten-hut!

1224
02:07:35.231 --> 02:07:38.526
Half the guys who missed their trains
are piled up in this station.

1225
02:07:38.568 --> 02:07:41.571
Ashley-Pitt, Roger,
MacDonald, Nimmo.

1226
02:07:41.612 --> 02:07:43.739
Makes quite a group.

1227
02:07:43.781 --> 02:07:45.783
What do we do?

1228
02:07:45.867 --> 02:07:47.618
Wait for the train.

1229
02:13:52.358 --> 02:13:53.776
Tallyho.

1230
02:14:37.319 --> 02:14:38.821
Tallyho.

1231
02:15:12.062 --> 02:15:14.898
- Are the police on the train?
- Yes, and the Gestapo are with them.

1232
02:15:14.982 --> 02:15:17.067
- We're gonna jump.
- All right.

1233
02:15:22.823 --> 02:15:26.243
- I'll tell you when.
- I'd prefer you give me a firm push.

1234
02:15:46.263 --> 02:15:49.391
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

1235
02:15:49.433 --> 02:15:51.060
That was quite exciting.

1236
02:15:53.103 --> 02:15:56.690
- It isn't stopping?
- No, we're all right.

1237
02:16:52.287 --> 02:16:53.706
Switzerland.

1238
02:21:36.405 --> 02:21:37.572
Bartlett.

1239
02:22:36.840 --> 02:22:38.800
Where were you going, Cavendish?

1240
02:22:38.842 --> 02:22:41.762
I hadn't quite decided.

1241
02:22:41.803 --> 02:22:44.556
What information
were you to collect on the way?

1242
02:22:44.639 --> 02:22:45.724
None.

1243
02:22:45.807 --> 02:22:48.518
What sabotage directions
did you receive?

1244
02:22:48.602 --> 02:22:50.979
What have you done
with your papers?

1245
02:22:52.481 --> 02:22:53.815
"Papers"?

1246
02:22:53.857 --> 02:22:56.193
Forged papers and identity cards.

1247
02:22:56.276 --> 02:22:59.529
Don't be so stupid.
What did you do with them?

1248
02:22:59.613 --> 02:23:01.865
All I did was to escape
from a prison camp.

1249
02:23:01.948 --> 02:23:04.743
You'd do the same if you'd been
locked up for three years.

1250
02:23:05.494 --> 02:23:06.995
I wanted to get home.

1251
02:23:07.037 --> 02:23:09.498
I don't think you'll ever see
your wife and children again.

1252
02:23:09.581 --> 02:23:12.334
You've obviously got the wrong man.
I'm not even married.

1253
02:23:12.417 --> 02:23:14.503
You're wearing civilian clothes.

1254
02:23:16.004 --> 02:23:19.424
You are a spy.
Spies are being shot.

1255
02:23:19.508 --> 02:23:23.303
This is my uniform.
I had to recut it when I lost weight.

1256
02:23:25.180 --> 02:23:28.100
I dyed it with boot polish
to cover oil smears...

1257
02:23:28.183 --> 02:23:30.185
I picked up
when I was shot down.

1258
02:23:40.987 --> 02:23:43.073
And you lost your insignia
over the years?

1259
02:23:44.074 --> 02:23:46.034
That's right.

1260
02:23:50.914 --> 02:23:52.958
- Now, look--
- That's all, Cavendish.

1261
02:24:18.150 --> 02:24:19.568
Hello, boys.

1262
02:24:24.156 --> 02:24:25.574
Hello.

1263
02:24:28.326 --> 02:24:30.412
- Hello, Haynes.
- Hello, Cavendish.

1264
02:24:32.205 --> 02:24:34.708
Wish I could say I was happy
to see you again.

1265
02:24:34.749 --> 02:24:37.377
- Just picked up?
- Yes, this morning.

1266
02:24:55.353 --> 02:24:57.814
There's a trainer out there
I can fly.

1267
02:24:57.898 --> 02:25:00.525
- Any sentries?
- Yeah, it's gonna be a problem.

1268
02:26:10.679 --> 02:26:13.765
When I say, "Go,"
crank this clockwise.

1269
02:26:13.848 --> 02:26:17.018
When the engine catches, don't move
or you'll get a mouthful of propeller.

1270
02:26:31.866 --> 02:26:33.034
Go!

1271
02:27:23.460 --> 02:27:24.919
Next stop, Switzerland.

1272
02:28:47.377 --> 02:28:48.837
The Alps.

1273
02:28:49.879 --> 02:28:51.214
Splendid.

1274
02:29:03.184 --> 02:29:06.354
Over this range, then 20 more minutes,
we've got it made.

1275
02:29:34.215 --> 02:29:35.758
What is it? Petrol?

1276
02:29:35.842 --> 02:29:38.261
I don't know. Fuel pump,
carburetor. We're losing power.

1277
02:30:03.369 --> 02:30:05.413
Go that way! I'll follow!

1278
02:30:42.700 --> 02:30:44.619
Stop! Don't shoot!

1279
02:30:49.123 --> 02:30:51.292
Collin?

1280
02:30:51.376 --> 02:30:53.378
I'm sorry I fouled things up.

1281
02:30:54.796 --> 02:30:56.464
That's all right.

1282
02:30:57.715 --> 02:30:59.259
Thank you for...

1283
02:31:00.552 --> 02:31:02.053
getting me...

1284
02:31:02.136 --> 02:31:03.471
out.

1285
02:34:41.481 --> 02:34:44.275
Hello? Hello?

1286
02:35:23.064 --> 02:35:25.399
Resistance. Resistance?

1287
02:35:26.734 --> 02:35:28.903
You are English?

1288
02:35:28.945 --> 02:35:30.571
I'm Australian.

1289
02:35:32.573 --> 02:35:34.492
You can speak English.
I understand.

1290
02:35:34.575 --> 02:35:36.536
Bloody good.

1291
02:35:36.577 --> 02:35:40.915
I'm a British officer. I've just escaped
from a prisoner-of-war camp in Germany.

1292
02:35:40.957 --> 02:35:43.251
I'm trying to make my way
into Spain now.

1293
02:35:43.334 --> 02:35:45.920
You understand me?
Can you help me now?

1294
02:35:50.258 --> 02:35:52.718
- I know someone who can.
- Bloody good.

1295
02:36:37.305 --> 02:36:39.307
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1296
02:36:40.433 --> 02:36:41.851
Out!

1297
02:37:45.331 --> 02:37:47.333
Halt! Halt!

1298
02:38:33.713 --> 02:38:35.214
You are English?

1299
02:39:16.756 --> 02:39:18.257
Herr Bartlett?

1300
02:39:26.057 --> 02:39:28.476
Your German is good...

1301
02:39:28.517 --> 02:39:30.644
and I hear also your French.

1302
02:39:32.813 --> 02:39:35.649
Your arms up!

1303
02:40:12.061 --> 02:40:14.522
Herr Bartlett...

1304
02:40:14.605 --> 02:40:17.066
and Herr MacDonald.

1305
02:40:19.902 --> 02:40:22.029
We are together again.

1306
02:40:22.071 --> 02:40:25.699
You are going to wish you had never
put us to so much trouble.

1307
02:40:42.508 --> 02:40:44.218
What's troubling you?

1308
02:40:44.260 --> 02:40:46.262
I'm just a little surprised.

1309
02:40:46.345 --> 02:40:49.723
I expected either a long stay
or a very short trip.

1310
02:40:49.807 --> 02:40:51.058
Yes.

1311
02:40:51.976 --> 02:40:54.603
I have to admit,
I'm a little worried.

1312
02:40:54.687 --> 02:40:57.356
I hope to God I haven't blotted
70-odd ledgers.

1313
02:40:57.398 --> 02:40:59.567
Oh, no.

1314
02:40:59.608 --> 02:41:03.070
We're all over 21,
footloose and fancy-free.

1315
02:41:03.154 --> 02:41:06.365
We'd never have got as far as we did
without you, Roger.

1316
02:41:06.407 --> 02:41:09.451
For what it's worth,
I think you did a damn good job.

1317
02:41:10.619 --> 02:41:12.329
I think we all did.

1318
02:41:12.413 --> 02:41:13.747
Yes.

1319
02:41:52.953 --> 02:41:56.832
All right. You can get out now.
Stretch your legs for five minutes.

1320
02:41:56.916 --> 02:42:00.294
It'll take hours
before you reach the camp.

1321
02:42:21.649 --> 02:42:23.609
You know, Mac, all this...

1322
02:42:23.651 --> 02:42:27.238
the organization, tunneling,
Tom and Harry...

1323
02:42:27.321 --> 02:42:28.822
kept me alive.

1324
02:42:29.907 --> 02:42:31.825
And even though we--

1325
02:42:33.494 --> 02:42:35.537
I've never been happier.

1326
02:42:36.455 --> 02:42:37.957
You know, Mac--

1327
02:43:18.998 --> 02:43:21.959
Eleven of your men
are being returned today.

1328
02:43:22.042 --> 02:43:23.877
Oh? Who?

1329
02:43:23.961 --> 02:43:25.963
I do not have that information.

1330
02:43:29.008 --> 02:43:32.219
I am directed by high authority
to inform you that--

1331
02:43:34.596 --> 02:43:38.225
that 50 of your officers
were shot while escaping.

1332
02:43:39.560 --> 02:43:40.853
"Shot"?

1333
02:43:42.146 --> 02:43:46.358
Their personal effects
will be returned.

1334
02:43:48.819 --> 02:43:50.529
How many were wounded?

1335
02:43:52.740 --> 02:43:54.950
Here are the names...

1336
02:43:55.034 --> 02:43:56.910
of the dead.

1337
02:43:59.455 --> 02:44:01.457
How many of the 50 were wounded?

1338
02:44:03.375 --> 02:44:04.752
None.

1339
02:44:05.753 --> 02:44:09.089
They-- The high authority...

1340
02:44:09.173 --> 02:44:12.092
only directs me
to inform you that--

1341
02:44:14.887 --> 02:44:16.555
that 50 men were--

1342
02:44:22.853 --> 02:44:24.104
I see.

1343
02:46:08.959 --> 02:46:10.961
I am your guide, serior.

1344
02:46:11.044 --> 02:46:12.421
Spain?

1345
02:46:34.568 --> 02:46:37.112
- Glad to see you're all safe.
- Thank you, sir.

1346
02:46:37.196 --> 02:46:39.531
- How many have been brought back, sir?
- You're the first.

1347
02:46:39.573 --> 02:46:41.575
- Do you know how many got away, sir?
- Not yet.

1348
02:46:42.951 --> 02:46:44.286
What happened to Blythe?

1349
02:46:46.121 --> 02:46:48.332
He didn't make it, sir.

1350
02:46:48.415 --> 02:46:50.584
Roger was right about that.

1351
02:46:51.502 --> 02:46:53.670
Roger didn't make it either.

1352
02:46:56.715 --> 02:47:00.636
I just posted the list.
They shot 50.

1353
02:47:00.719 --> 02:47:02.804
The Gestapo murdered them.

1354
02:47:04.556 --> 02:47:08.060
Fifty? MacDonald?
Ashley-Pitt?

1355
02:47:08.936 --> 02:47:11.063
- Yes.
- Danny and Willie?

1356
02:47:11.104 --> 02:47:13.106
No, they're not on the list.

1357
02:47:13.190 --> 02:47:16.151
- Haynes?
- Yes.

1358
02:47:17.694 --> 02:47:19.071
I'm sorry.

1359
02:47:21.156 --> 02:47:24.743
Roger's idea was to get back at
the enemy the hardest way he could.

1360
02:47:24.785 --> 02:47:27.037
Mess up their works.

1361
02:47:27.120 --> 02:47:30.332
From what we've heard here,
I think he did exactly that.

1362
02:47:30.415 --> 02:47:32.960
Do you think
it was worth the price?

1363
02:47:34.169 --> 02:47:36.672
That depends on
your point of view.

1364
02:47:39.800 --> 02:47:41.134
Yes, sir.

1365
02:48:31.143 --> 02:48:33.145
He is not to be saluted.

1366
02:48:33.186 --> 02:48:35.606
He's no longer in command.

1367
02:48:42.863 --> 02:48:45.157
Job just didn't work out, huh?

1368
02:48:45.198 --> 02:48:47.200
- You were lucky, Hilts.
- "Lucky"?

1369
02:48:47.284 --> 02:48:49.286
It won't be because I didn't--

1370
02:48:50.787 --> 02:48:52.122
How many?

1371
02:48:52.831 --> 02:48:53.832
Fifty.

1372
02:48:56.293 --> 02:49:01.465
It looks, after all, as if you

1373
02:49:54.101 --> 02:49:55.394
Sir.
