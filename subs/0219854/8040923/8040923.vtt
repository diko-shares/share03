00:01:04.583 --> 00:01:06.659
I'm sorry. I can't seem to find my purse.

2
00:01:06.746 --> 00:01:08.822
I must have ten of them.

3
00:01:08.919 --> 00:01:10.828
Can you just ring mine first, please?

4
00:01:10.918 --> 00:01:12.628
There's someone ahead of you, sir.

5
00:01:12.708 --> 00:01:15.127
I usually keep my change in
my little change bear, but...

6
00:01:15.207 --> 00:01:17.756
That's almost interesting.
How much is hers?

7
00:01:19.126 --> 00:01:21.255
- 5.26.
- Just add it on, please.

8
00:01:21.345 --> 00:01:22.385
Hold on, hold on.

9
00:01:22.465 --> 00:01:24.384
If it's not in this one,
it'll be in another one.

10
00:01:24.464 --> 00:01:26.804
- That'll be 9.65.
- Thank you very much.

11
00:01:26.884 --> 00:01:29.183
How sweet. You didn't
have to do that for me.

12
00:01:29.263 --> 00:01:30.682
I didn't do it for you.

13
00:01:30.762 --> 00:01:32.512
Check some bags next time.

14
00:01:32.602 --> 00:01:34.471
(SCOFFS) Jerk.

15
00:01:48.317 --> 00:01:51.696
- How can I help you, Governor?
- Some dirtbag...

16
00:01:51.776 --> 00:01:54.575
dirtbag...
from the attorney general's office...

17
00:01:54.655 --> 00:01:57.614
had dared to mention the word "jail."

18
00:01:57.694 --> 00:02:01.493
Waaah.

19
00:02:01.573 --> 00:02:04.582
Waaah!

20
00:02:04.662 --> 00:02:09.001
Somebody call the "waaambulance"!

21
00:02:09.081 --> 00:02:10.671
What? What did you say?

22
00:02:19.338 --> 00:02:21.337
Governor, do you know
what the number one killer...

23
00:02:21.427 --> 00:02:23.797
- of politicians under the age of 60 is?
<i>- No.</i>

24
00:02:23.887 --> 00:02:25.256
Self pity.

25
00:02:25.346 --> 00:02:27.885
Governor, I'll be more than happy
to help you out of this mess...

26
00:02:27.975 --> 00:02:30.305
that you so willingly
seem to have stepped into.

27
00:02:30.385 --> 00:02:33.434
<i>- But you ought to do something.</i>
- What's that?

28
00:02:33.514 --> 00:02:35.763
- Stop crying.
- I'll try.

29
00:02:35.853 --> 00:02:39.392
<i>No, I mean right now.
You're giving me a headache.</i>

30
00:02:54.697 --> 00:02:57.946
<i>Excuse me, folks, anything more to drink?</i>

31
00:02:59.116 --> 00:03:00.656
Do y'all have any single-malt scotch?

32
00:03:00.746 --> 00:03:01.745
<i>Sure do.</i>

33
00:03:03.075 --> 00:03:07.334
- So, what do you do for a living?

<i>You wanna tell me about it?</i>

35
00:03:10.043 --> 00:03:12.332
You know, comfort of strangers
and all that.

36
00:03:12.422 --> 00:03:13.582
No.

37
00:03:16.751 --> 00:03:18.590
Oh. Must be something on the Internet.

38
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.549
Or finance.

39
00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:24.638
(GASPS) Genetic engineering, maybe, huh?

40
00:03:24.718 --> 00:03:28.927
- I'm an image consultant, okay?
- Okay.

41
00:03:50.571 --> 00:03:52.110
So you sort of troubleshoot for folks?

42
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.869
You know, give 'em makeovers
when they need revamping, right?

43
00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:58.078
Right.

44
00:03:59.328 --> 00:04:00.328
Hey, look,

45
00:04:01.327 --> 00:04:04.626
<i>I'm flying to L.A. to start
an anchor job in the local news,</i>

46
00:04:04.706 --> 00:04:07.785
and I do not think that it's an accident
that I'm sitting next to you.

47
00:04:08.835 --> 00:04:09.755
I see.

48
00:04:09.835 --> 00:04:12.964
So the cosmic purpose of our meeting
is for me to give you free advice.

49
00:04:13.374 --> 00:04:14.633
What do I get out of it?

50
00:04:14.713 --> 00:04:19.002
We don't know yet. But I'll owe you.

51
00:04:36.057 --> 00:04:40.606
- If I do it, will you shut up?
- Quiet as the dead.

53
00:04:42.815 --> 00:04:43.985
Your hair's too big,

54
00:04:44.065 --> 00:04:45.814
your brows are too dark,
your nails are too long...

55
00:04:45.904 --> 00:04:47.814
and your foundation's too orange.

56
00:04:47.903 --> 00:04:51.402
Your perfume's too sweet.
It's the news, honey, not the prom.

57
00:04:51.492 --> 00:04:54.661
- I like your eyes...
- Oh. Thank you.

58
00:04:54.741 --> 00:04:57.571
Bluer. Try the tinted contacts.

59
00:04:57.661 --> 00:04:59.530
But only when you're anchoring or in L.A.

60
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.289
When you're on assignment, take them out.

61
00:05:01.369 --> 00:05:03.039
What about my accent?

62
00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:05.368
I'm always being warned
to stop saying "y'all."

63
00:05:05.498 --> 00:05:08.917
Don't ever stop saying "y'all."
Your "y'all" is your trademark.

64
00:05:08.997 --> 00:05:11.756
Say "y'all," and you'll be
promoted in six months.

65
00:05:11.836 --> 00:05:14.925
Say "y'all" with a smile,
you'll be famous in 12.

66
00:05:15.585 --> 00:05:19.544
Well... (CHUCKLES) Thank you.

67
00:05:19.634 --> 00:05:20.884
You're welcome.

68
00:05:21.303 --> 00:05:25.012
Now, will you please shut up?

69
00:05:43.357 --> 00:05:47.526
All right, let me have him.
Hello, Your Honor. How are you?

70
00:05:48.155 --> 00:05:49.525
Good. Thank you.

71
00:05:50.365 --> 00:05:52.234
Define "not exactly alone."

72
00:05:54.743 --> 00:05:57.033
Your Honor, was this mannequin inflatable?

73
00:06:00.162 --> 00:06:01.371
You know if the press...

79
00:06:28.393 --> 00:06:29.433

84
00:06:42.609 --> 00:06:44.689
<i>I'm wearing my yellow tie?
You can't even see me.</i>

85
00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:46.818
I can hear the stress in your voice.

86
00:06:46.898 --> 00:06:48.817
Whenever you're stressed,
you wear the yellow tie,

87
00:06:48.907 --> 00:06:51.826
which makes you feel all-powerful,
so you're probably gonna yell at me,

88
00:06:51.906 --> 00:06:55.405
which I'm not in the mood for, so don't.

89
00:06:56.115 --> 00:06:59.494
- Nice tie.
- I am not stressed.

90
00:06:59.574 --> 00:07:01.663
There is nothing wrong with me.

91
00:07:01.743 --> 00:07:03.203
I just didn't get enough sleep last night.

92
00:07:03.293 --> 00:07:04.493
Can I have today's work, please?

93
00:07:04.583 --> 00:07:06.752
Take your phone off.
You're with a human now.

<i>I did the ones and twos.
There's a three, a four.</i>

95

I flagged the five in your mail.

96
00:07:11.541 --> 00:07:13.500
There's an eight on your desk to sign.

97
00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:16.209
And there's a ten standing in your office.

98
00:07:27.556 --> 00:07:29.725
Why did you let him in my office, Janet?

99
00:07:29.805 --> 00:07:31.435
He threatened me with a machete.

100
00:07:32.804 --> 00:07:34.973
He's your father, Russ.

101
00:07:39.312 --> 00:07:42.771
Wait 60 seconds and come in and tell me
I'm late for something.

102
00:07:42.861 --> 00:07:46.150

Well, it would be,

Oh.

109
00:08:05.874 --> 00:08:07.954
So, Dad, what can I do for you?

110
00:08:08.044 --> 00:08:10.213
Did you get the check
I sent over this morning?

111
00:08:10.293 --> 00:08:12.292
Yes, yes, I did.

112
00:08:14.042 --> 00:08:16.881
But I didn't ask you for a check.

113
00:08:16.961 --> 00:08:19.550
I asked you to come over
and help me lift a few things.

114
00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:22.969
(SIGHS) Well, time is money, Dad,

115
00:08:23.049 --> 00:08:25.348
and my time is worth
a lot more than a mover's,

116

is gonna have to do.</i>

Dozens of irate and highly
important people are clamoring for you.

We made a bet. I make him look handsome,
I get a free hot dog.

Please stop biting your nails, Amy.

I care because you work for me.

you're advertising weakness.

Really? Advertising weakness

00:11:18.177 --> 00:11:20.216
Hi. I'm Josh, Mr. Riley's assistant.

173
00:11:20.306 --> 00:11:22.215
- If you need anything...
- I do.

174
00:11:22.305 --> 00:11:23.675
I need you to go up in the bleachers

175
00:11:23.765 --> 00:11:25.634
and find me a dozen 8 to 12-year-old kids.

176
00:11:25.764 --> 00:11:30.643
Eight boys, four girls.
Five white, four Latino, three black.

177
00:11:30.723 --> 00:11:33.182
- Have 'em back here in three minutes.
- Okay.

178
00:11:33.272 --> 00:11:35.312
I need to use your Hi-8 for this one.

179
00:11:35.392 --> 00:11:37.521
So why is everybody busting my chops?

180
00:11:37.601 --> 00:11:39.560
And the way I see this thing,

181
00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:41.820
it's just a little misunderstanding.

182
00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:45.648
(LAUGHS) Okay, Bob,
let me see if I can explain to you...

183
00:11:45.738 --> 00:11:48.028
how other people see this little thing.

184
00:11:48.698 --> 00:11:50.197
You see, to Joe Baseball Fan out there,

185
00:11:50.277 --> 00:11:52.326
you're the guy that promised
you would give five percent...

186
00:11:52.406 --> 00:11:54.246
of each ticket sold this season

187
00:11:54.326 --> 00:11:56.995
to establishing a baseball
camp for inner-city kids.

188
00:11:57.075 --> 00:11:58.994
You're also the guy that gave pictures

189
00:11:59.074 --> 00:12:01.164
to the press of kids
actually attending this camp,

190
00:12:01.244 --> 00:12:02.913
which, in fact, does not exist.

191
00:12:02.993 --> 00:12:06.922
Yet. I was intending
to get around to it, uh, eventually.

192
00:12:07.002 --> 00:12:10.791
- Ah.
<i>- I am a very busy guy.</i>

193
00:12:10.881 --> 00:12:14.300
- (LAUGHS)
- No, Bob, you're not a busy man.

194
00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:17.469
See, what you are is a "stoopid" man.

195
00:12:17.549 --> 00:12:21.008
A very stupid guy who only played
Mr. Charitable...

196
00:12:21.098 --> 00:12:22.927
because you wanted to suck up
to City Council...

197
00:12:23.007 --> 00:12:26.516
so they'd build you
a brand-new baseball park.

198
00:12:26.596 --> 00:12:28.846
<i>But guess what. Bye-bye, ballpark.</i>

199

Hello, jail.

200
00:12:33.474 --> 00:12:35.184
So what's your big plan?

201
00:12:35.274 --> 00:12:37.273
How do you feel about chocolate cream pie?

202
00:12:38.523 --> 00:12:42.402
<i>Why? She gonna feed the kids cream pie
to get me out of this mess?</i>

203
00:12:42.481 --> 00:12:45.611
No. The kids are gonna feed you
cream pie and get you out of this mess.

204
00:12:45.691 --> 00:12:48.200
- Huh?
- Bob,

205
00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.199
prepare to be pied.

206
00:12:50.279 --> 00:12:53.618
- (KIDS LAUGHING)
- I deserve it!

207
00:12:53.698 --> 00:12:55.907
More pie in the face!

208
00:12:56.497 --> 00:12:58.917
Bob, the press is gonna eat this up.

209
00:12:58.997 --> 00:13:00.916

210
00:13:00.996 --> 00:13:04.335

211
00:13:04.455 --> 00:13:07.794

very creepy about all this.</i>

212
00:13:07.874 --> 00:13:10.963
Amy, Amy, I swear to you...

213
00:13:11.043 --> 00:13:12.962
I will make sure that
the editing of this tape

214
00:13:13.042 --> 00:13:15.092
is handled tastefully, okay?

215
00:13:15.172 --> 00:13:17.921
- I'm sure you will.
<i>- No, I promise.</i>

216
00:13:18.011 --> 00:13:20.510
- We didn't do anything wrong today.
- No.

217
00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:23.509
We did the right thing
by our client, Bob Riley.

218
00:13:23.599 --> 00:13:25.429
I love him.

219
00:13:25.519 --> 00:13:31.227
Russ, today we shamelessly exploited
innocent children...

220
00:13:31.307 --> 00:13:35.026
just to help some crook
with his cash flow problems.

221
00:13:38.945 --> 00:13:41.104
Are you gonna finish
this last piece of yellowtail?

222
00:13:41.194 --> 00:13:43.733
Russ, you should be concerned
about this. You're turning 40 in...

223
00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:46.822
Thank you so much for bringing that up.
And you're not at an age...

224
00:13:46.902 --> 00:13:48.952
Yes, we both are.

225
00:13:49.032 --> 00:13:50.611
We can't go around anymore

226
00:13:50.701 --> 00:13:53.200
talking about what we're going
to be like when we grow up.

227
00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.290
We are up.

228
00:13:57.579 --> 00:14:00.418
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

229
00:14:00.498 --> 00:14:04.127
- You finished?
- Yeah, I'm finished.

230
00:14:04.207 --> 00:14:05.337
Good.

232
00:14:10.005 --> 00:14:12.135
in the same day, does that make it true?

233
00:14:12.215 --> 00:14:14.714
- What, only four? Did you get up late?
- Excuse me.

234
00:14:14.794 --> 00:14:16.463
I'm asking Toshiya.

235
00:14:16.553 --> 00:14:18.013
Just four times, a pattern.

236
00:14:18.093 --> 00:14:20.472
It have to be five times to be a fact.

237
00:14:20.552 --> 00:14:23.221
Thank you very much.
You see? There is hope.

238
00:14:23.301 --> 00:14:24.431
Jerk.

239
00:14:25.601 --> 00:14:26.720
Thank you.

240
00:14:32.728 --> 00:14:35.978
Yo, Pedro, make sure
this gets in the trash.

241
00:14:43.905 --> 00:14:45.115
Yes!

242
00:14:46.234 --> 00:14:47.734
That was fantastic!

243
00:14:47.824 --> 00:14:51.573

(KISSES) fantastic thing!

244
00:14:51.653 --> 00:14:52.992
Me neither.

245
00:14:53.742 --> 00:14:55.832

246
00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:01.620
Probably still in there.

249
00:15:06.538 --> 00:15:09.917
You're right. I shouldn't go in there.

250
00:15:10.007 --> 00:15:12.257
I'm wearing a $2,000 suit.
Come on. I'll give you a boost.

251

Distract yourself.

Honor your instincts. Look at the moon.

253

- What? Look at what?

254
00:15:19.844 --> 00:15:20.974
Look.

255
00:15:22.384 --> 00:15:26.222
Isn't it lovely? It's big, it's beautiful,

256
00:15:26.302 --> 00:15:28.812
it's revolving around the Earth,
proving once again...

257
00:15:28.892 --> 00:15:31.311
that the universe
does not revolve around you.

258
00:15:31.941 --> 00:15:33.940
It's worth a look, if you ask me.

259
00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:36.899
Are you looking?

260
00:15:37.519 --> 00:15:39.439
- I looked.
- Look again!

261
00:15:39.529 --> 00:15:40.988
Okay! Amy...

262
00:15:42.028 --> 00:15:43.947

263
00:15:44.027 --> 00:15:45.367
Can we go?

264
00:15:46.027 --> 00:15:49.236
- Come on, grumpy.
- Hey, will you stop?

265
00:15:49.326 --> 00:15:50.825
I stopped.

266
00:15:51.535 --> 00:15:54.494
I want to show you something.
Tell me if you think this is cute.

267
00:15:56.453 --> 00:16:00.952
Oh! Look at the moon!
It's so big and round,

268
00:16:01.042 --> 00:16:03.791
and when I look at it,
I'm all perky and excited!

269
00:16:03.871 --> 00:16:07.000
And no one would ever know
that I'm almost 30! Ooh!

270
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:09.839
What do you think?

271
00:16:09.919 --> 00:16:12.339
Cute or just stupid?

272
00:16:16.637 --> 00:16:20.926
You know, Russ,
just when I think I've seen the worst,

273
00:16:21.016 --> 00:16:24.305
that there's no possible way
you could be more of a jerk,

274
00:16:27.934 --> 00:16:29.354
you outdo yourself.

275
00:16:31.433 --> 00:16:32.563
And then,

276
00:16:35.402 --> 00:16:39.231
just when I'm about to leave,
you do something.

277
00:16:39.321 --> 00:16:42.940

279
00:16:49.987 --> 00:16:52.787
That's when I decide to hang around
for five more minutes,

280
00:16:53.656 --> 00:16:55.536

00:16:57.455 --> 00:16:58.745

Uh-huh. Nothing. Fine.

You wanna hear something funny?
I was downstairs...

516
00:34:21.143 --> 00:34:23.482
- and now I'm upstairs, you see...
<i>- Hey.</i>

517
00:34:23.562 --> 00:34:25.142
You dropped this.

518
00:34:25.941 --> 00:34:28.361
- (JANET) Russ, hello!

Ohh.

You are just a hallucination!

523
00:34:41.287 --> 00:34:43.866
One that is about to disappear.

524
00:34:46.245 --> 00:34:48.745
Prepare to disappear!

525
00:34:53.413 --> 00:34:55.463
You better disappear.

526
00:34:57.582 --> 00:34:59.501
I'm sitting on the floor.

527
00:34:59.591 --> 00:35:01.751

those confidentiality papers
at the office?

539
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:14.889
- Yeah.
- And do you remember me telling you...

540
00:36:14.969 --> 00:36:16.928
that if you ever said anything

541
00:36:17.018 --> 00:36:18.808
to anyone about anything
that happens in this company...

542
00:36:18.888 --> 00:36:22.187

Yes, I, um, can.

548
00:36:53.667 --> 00:36:55.837

Okay.

552
00:37:08.343 --> 00:37:11.512
This little boy is me at age eight.

553
00:37:11.592 --> 00:37:14.011
And I want you to make him disappear.

554
00:37:14.101 --> 00:37:17.020

- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

Please.

00:37:24.018 --> 00:37:26.397
- How was the therapist this morning?
- Do it, Janet!

558
00:37:26.477 --> 00:37:28.277
How am I supposed to make a kid disappear?

559
00:37:28.357 --> 00:37:30.816
Hey, you are the assistant!

560
00:37:30.896 --> 00:37:32.816
Figure it out, okay?

561
00:37:32.906 --> 00:37:35.115
You yelled at me! That is great.
That... That helps.

Get in the car.

- Oh, fired, I hope.

00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:01.429
Did he invite you up
for a little bit of cheese?

685
00:44:01.509 --> 00:44:03.969
Did he blow fart bubbles
out of his butt, huh?

686
00:44:04.048 --> 00:44:05.098
Because if he didn't,

687
00:44:05.178 --> 00:44:07.427
then there really isn't any reason
to be excited about the moon,

688
00:44:07.507 --> 00:44:11.766
<i>- is there?</i>
- Sorry. I'll never get excited again.

689
00:44:12.186 --> 00:44:13.846
Obviously.

691
00:44:16.855 --> 00:44:19.104
Can I ask you a question?

692
00:44:21.023 --> 00:44:24.812
Why does the moon get
like orangey sometimes?

693
00:44:28.111 --> 00:44:30.990
Because there is a, uh...

694
00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:34.869
a band of, uh...

695
00:44:41.197 --> 00:44:45.036

696
00:44:45.456 --> 00:44:47.625

00:45:45.668 --> 00:45:47.578
Okay. Vivian.

709
00:45:47.667 --> 00:45:49.997
You're going public, you're making an IPO,

00:45:50.087 --> 00:45:52.006
your software's brilliant,
and that's all great.

711

you have to understand...

get a little dicey.

00:45:59.634 --> 00:46:02.343
Dicey. That's right. Very, very dicey.

Yes, Amy. This is Melissa.

(WHISPERING) No, it is the other one.

748

- The one she doesn't like to talk about.
- Oh, I see.

749
00:47:45.412 --> 00:47:47.582
Which completely explains
why you never told me about him.

00:47:47.662 --> 00:47:50.171

<i>So are you having fun with your uncle?</i>

752
00:47:55.049 --> 00:47:58.628

<i>he didn't give me any breakfast,</i>

754
00:48:01.008 --> 00:48:03.097

755
00:48:03.177 --> 00:48:05.096
That is a problem.

756
00:48:05.176 --> 00:48:07.926
- You made him sleep outside?
- He slept in a tent.

757
00:48:08.016 --> 00:48:10.145
- You've got a tent?
- It was his tent.

758
00:48:10.225 --> 00:48:12.604
You didn't give him any breakfast.

759
00:48:13.014 --> 00:48:15.683
He can stand to miss a meal.

I bet she likes dogs.

770
00:48:49.873 --> 00:48:52.292
I don't know what's worse.
The fact that I'm stuck with you...

771
00:48:52.382 --> 00:48:54.292
or the idea that I don't
know what to do about it.

772
00:48:54.382 --> 00:48:56.301
Why don't we eat something?

773

Why? Because you don't know what to do,
you just wanna stuff your face?

No, because it says to

01:12:42.674 --> 01:12:45.543
I mean, you're obviously in trouble.
He'd straighten you out.

1191
01:12:45.633 --> 01:12:47.963
You think he's here to straighten <i>me</i> out?

1192
01:12:48.053 --> 01:12:49.972
Well, of course.

1193
01:12:50.552 --> 01:12:52.591
You didn't think it was
the other way around, did you?

1194
01:12:56.850 --> 01:12:59.679
Maybe he's here for you to teach him
some things.

1195
01:12:59.769 --> 01:13:04.018
But maybe he's here for you
to <i>remember</i> some things.

1196
01:13:04.228 --> 01:13:05.557
Ever thought about that?

1197
01:13:09.356 --> 01:13:11.736
Not until just now, no.

1198
01:13:12.485 --> 01:13:14.105
Darlin', look...

1199
01:13:16.024 --> 01:13:18.234
You're turnin' 40 tomorrow.

1200
01:13:18.324 --> 01:13:23.862
You haven't acquired a single thing
of real value in your life...

1201
01:13:23.952 --> 01:13:25.911
- Hey...
- And no, no, money doesn't count.

1202
01:13:27.031 --> 01:13:30.620
You're virtually friendless,
you barely talk to your family,

1203
01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:32.579
and you've just lost the only
woman in the world

1204
01:13:32.669 --> 01:13:34.119
who's ever meant anything to you.

1205
01:13:34.209 --> 01:13:37.838
Who, Amy? Please.

1206
01:13:37.918 --> 01:13:41.797
Look, she's not the only woman
in the world, okay?

1207
01:13:41.877 --> 01:13:43.876
She... She works for me.

1208
01:13:43.966 --> 01:13:47.005
She's neurotic. She bites her nails.

1209
01:13:47.095 --> 01:13:48.345
Nail.

1210
01:13:51.174 --> 01:13:52.513
This one.

1211
01:13:54.843 --> 01:13:56.262
Oh, my God.

1212
01:14:01.681 --> 01:14:05.400
Excuse me. Um, while he's gettin' a clue,
could I get a warmup, please?

1213
01:14:05.479 --> 01:14:07.059
Thank you.

1214
01:14:09.778 --> 01:14:12.068
Okay, don't stop. Go on.

1215
01:14:12.147 --> 01:14:14.197
What's it like?

1216
01:14:14.277 --> 01:14:16.816
He keeps asking about his future.

1217
01:14:16.906 --> 01:14:19.695
My past. Haven't really told him much.

1218
01:14:19.785 --> 01:14:21.785
- Good.
- Good?

1219
01:14:21.865 --> 01:14:23.244
You think that's good?

1220
01:14:23.994 --> 01:14:26.373
Why? What would you do?

1221
01:14:26.453 --> 01:14:29.452
If little Deirdre was suddenly here?

1222
01:14:29.542 --> 01:14:33.411
Burstin' out of her St. Mary's uniform
askin' <i>me</i> what comes next?

1223
01:14:33.501 --> 01:14:34.711
Yeah.

1224
01:14:35.790 --> 01:14:38.040
I'd say, "Baby,

1225
01:14:38.460 --> 01:14:40.549
don't you worry about a thing.

1226
01:14:40.629 --> 01:14:43.218
Everything is just gonna be great."

1227
01:14:45.338 --> 01:14:47.217
I mean, how many of us turn out the way...

1228
01:14:47.297 --> 01:14:50.056
we think we will when we're kids, really?

1229
01:14:52.096 --> 01:14:56.264
I mean, how many of us
grow up to be astronauts?

1230
01:14:56.514 --> 01:14:59.683
Or prima ballerinas?

1231
01:15:01.723 --> 01:15:05.392
We just all do the best we can.

1232
01:15:14.779 --> 01:15:17.158
Time for me to take big Deirdre home.

1233
01:15:17.238 --> 01:15:19.117
(MOUTHS WORDS)

1234
01:15:19.197 --> 01:15:20.407
You know, if you want to learn

1235
01:15:20.487 --> 01:15:22.037
about your childhood,
seems like you're on line...

1236
01:15:22.117 --> 01:15:24.576
with a pretty good source,
you know what I mean?

1237
01:15:24.656 --> 01:15:26.575
Yes, I am.

1238
01:15:27.875 --> 01:15:30.284
Deirdre, thanks
for taking the time to help.

1239
01:15:32.453 --> 01:15:34.963
Well, don't ever stop
asking for help, Russ.

1240
01:15:36.372 --> 01:15:38.292
You just might get it.

1241
01:15:40.631 --> 01:15:43.300
- Thanks.
- You take care.

1242
01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:46.179
Bye, y'all.

1243
01:15:47.839 --> 01:15:49.258
Bye.

1244
01:16:02.315 --> 01:16:05.734
<i>Hi, Janet, it's me.
I'm sorry to call so late.</i>

1245
01:16:05.813 --> 01:16:07.853
It's okay, Russ. I think I'll recover.

1246
01:16:07.943 --> 01:16:10.022
I just want you to cancel
all my appointments tomorrow

1247
01:16:10.112 --> 01:16:11.522
and move them to Friday.

1248
01:16:11.612 --> 01:16:14.401
- Anything else?
- No, that's it.

1249
01:16:15.071 --> 01:16:17.320
<i>- Okay, you got it.
- No, wait.</i>

1250
01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:19.819
There is something else.

1251
01:16:21.029 --> 01:16:23.578
I want you to find out
why the full moon looks orange

1252
01:16:23.658 --> 01:16:26.077
sometimes when it rises.

1253
01:16:26.157 --> 01:16:30.576
<i>- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks, Janet. Good night.</i>

1254
01:16:47.931 --> 01:16:51.260
<i>Hey, kid. Rusty.</i>

1255
01:16:53.639 --> 01:16:57.268
- Hi.
- Hi.

1256
01:16:59.138 --> 01:17:00.727
Wanna help me with something?

1257
01:17:01.807 --> 01:17:03.766
<i>I think it might get you back
to your time.</i>

1258
01:17:03.856 --> 01:17:04.896
Sure.

1259
01:17:05.726 --> 01:17:07.105
Good.

1260
01:17:09.314 --> 01:17:11.314
Anything about me?

1261
01:17:12.154 --> 01:17:14.983
Yeah. Anything that'll take me back.

1262
01:17:15.073 --> 01:17:17.072
Hmm.

1263
01:17:17.152 --> 01:17:19.781
You know how I like
to find caterpillars...

1264
01:17:19.861 --> 01:17:22.371
and put them in jars and feed 'em...

1265
01:17:22.950 --> 01:17:25.410
and watch 'em make cocoons?

1266
01:17:29.498 --> 01:17:30.748
No.

1267
01:17:31.378 --> 01:17:33.337
And then one day,

1268
01:17:33.627 --> 01:17:36.166
they break out and it's really cool.

1269
01:17:38.626 --> 01:17:40.295
No. Not a clue.

1270
01:17:41.005 --> 01:17:43.254
But keep going. Tell me some more stuff.

1271
01:17:43.504 --> 01:17:46.263
Remember last summer
at Josie's birthday party...

1272
01:17:46.343 --> 01:17:49.173
when I got Parmesan cheese
stuck up my nose?

1273
01:17:51.512 --> 01:17:53.221
<i>Got any sixes?</i>

1274
01:17:53.301 --> 01:17:55.141
Nope. Go fish.

1275
01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:57.890
Any fours?

1276
01:17:57.980 --> 01:18:00.189
Negative. Go fish.

1277
01:18:03.688 --> 01:18:05.188
Got any sevens?

1278
01:18:08.147 --> 01:18:10.066
Tell me some more about Dad.

1279
01:18:12.196 --> 01:18:13.485
Sometimes...

1280
01:18:14.235 --> 01:18:16.324
he lets me help him work on the car.

1281
01:18:16.404 --> 01:18:18.444
If I do something wrong...

1282
01:18:18.534 --> 01:18:20.573
he yells at me.

1283
01:18:22.363 --> 01:18:24.782
<i>Sometimes he buys me ice cream afterwards.</i>

1284
01:18:24.872 --> 01:18:28.251
<i>But still, I don't like messing up.</i>

1285
01:18:29.291 --> 01:18:30.750
Like last week...

1286
01:18:30.830 --> 01:18:32.620
I lost a screw.

1287
01:18:33.959 --> 01:18:35.669
I was afraid to tell him.

1288
01:18:37.298 --> 01:18:39.627
<i>I found it later on in my pocket.</i>

1289
01:18:40.257 --> 01:18:42.427
Look, I still have it.

1290
01:18:47.925 --> 01:18:50.514
<i>I'm afraid to give it back to him.</i>

1291
01:18:52.634 --> 01:18:54.223
Got any nines?

1292
01:18:58.392 --> 01:18:59.641
No.

1293
01:19:00.431 --> 01:19:03.770
My homeroom teacher last year
was fat Mrs. Kinkelman.

1294
01:19:03.850 --> 01:19:06.479
She was so much better than Mr. Lupus.

1295
01:19:06.569 --> 01:19:08.899
He had that purple bump on his face.

1296
01:19:08.979 --> 01:19:11.488
I don't remember the bump guy.
What grade was that?

1297
01:19:11.568 --> 01:19:13.527
How come you're asking me all this stuff?

1298
01:19:13.607 --> 01:19:15.777
'Cause I'm forgetting something.

1299
01:19:15.867 --> 01:19:18.406
I'm forgetting this one event
that meant something to me...

1300
01:19:18.486 --> 01:19:21.495
and if I can remember that one thing,
maybe I can get you home.

1301
01:19:21.575 --> 01:19:23.914
Are you sure it's not the purple bump?

1302
01:19:23.994 --> 01:19:26.833
- It's not the bump, kid.
- It was a pretty big bump.

1303
01:19:26.913 --> 01:19:28.663
- Tell me more about second grade.
- Why?

1304
01:19:28.743 --> 01:19:31.082
Nobody had a bump in second grade.

1305
01:19:33.171 --> 01:19:36.540
My best friend was Tim Wheaton,
until a few months ago.

1306
01:19:36.630 --> 01:19:38.380
Remember him?

1307
01:19:38.460 --> 01:19:40.259
No, I don't.

1308
01:19:40.419 --> 01:19:43.798
- His house smells like fish sticks.
- No.

1309
01:19:43.878 --> 01:19:45.258
Well, he was my best friend

1310
01:19:45.338 --> 01:19:47.807
until he started hanging out with Vince...

1311
01:19:47.887 --> 01:19:50.516
and these other creepy guys.

1312
01:19:50.596 --> 01:19:54.015
He threw a rock at me
and we haven't been friends since then.

1313
01:19:54.095 --> 01:19:57.014
- He threw a rock at us?
- Oh, yeah.

1314
01:19:57.104 --> 01:20:00.023
<i>- Why? What happened?</i>
- Oh, those guys get together...

1315
01:20:00.103 --> 01:20:02.683
every recess in the corner
of the playground yard...

1316
01:20:02.773 --> 01:20:04.772
where they like to pick on kids.

1317
01:20:06.232 --> 01:20:08.361
Back behind the kindergarten.

1318
01:20:09.191 --> 01:20:11.860
Yeah. Where the yard monitor
can't see you!

1319
01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:14.449
- Where that big sliding board is?
- Yeah, the really huge one!

1320
01:20:14.529 --> 01:20:16.528
- You remember it!
- Go on. Don't stop.

1321
01:20:16.618 --> 01:20:19.618
There's four of them,
and if they don't like you...

1322
01:20:19.698 --> 01:20:22.117
they make your life a nightmare!

1323
01:20:29.125 --> 01:20:32.834
And the worst thing about them
is they're really mean to animals.

1324
01:20:32.914 --> 01:20:35.173
Especially this one three-legged dog.

1325
01:20:35.253 --> 01:20:37.292
<i>(BARKING)</i>

1326
01:20:37.382 --> 01:20:38.592
Tripod!

1327
01:20:39.462 --> 01:20:41.921
Tripod! The dog's name is Tripod!

1328
01:20:42.011 --> 01:20:44.970
<i>I know the dog's name!
I know everything, kid.</i>

1329
01:20:45.050 --> 01:20:47.179
I know why you're here! This is the event!

1330
01:20:47.259 --> 01:20:49.559
<i>Vince Kajinski, the fight! The fight!</i>

1331
01:20:49.639 --> 01:20:53.637
It was my eighth birthday.
It was 32 years ago.

1332
01:20:53.727 --> 01:20:56.347
Today! Ha, Ha, Ha!

1333
01:21:03.065 --> 01:21:05.194
Holy smokes.

1334
01:21:07.943 --> 01:21:09.982
Look at the car!

1335
01:21:11.902 --> 01:21:13.941
Look at your clothes!

1336
01:21:16.820 --> 01:21:19.410
(WHISPERING) Holy smokes.

1337
01:21:20.529 --> 01:21:23.119
- Holy smokes!
- Holy smokes!

1338
01:21:23.199 --> 01:21:27.417
- We did it, kid!
- Am I home! Is it really 1968?

1339
01:21:32.166 --> 01:21:34.755
No doubt about it, kid.
What time's recess?

1340
01:21:34.835 --> 01:21:37.754
- 10:30.
- Hang on, kid.

1341
01:21:37.834 --> 01:21:40.133
We've got 15 minutes to change our life.

1342
01:21:40.213 --> 01:21:42.673
Okay, now listen.
This is gonna happen real fast,

1343
01:21:42.753 --> 01:21:44.422
so you gotta remember
what Kenny told you, all right:

1344
01:21:44.512 --> 01:21:45.762
one, two, one, two.

1345
01:21:45.842 --> 01:21:48.841
- One, two...
- Keep your head down, keep swingin'.

1346
01:21:48.931 --> 01:21:51.560
<i>(BELL RINGING)</i>

1347
01:21:58.728 --> 01:22:01.727
Look, look, look!
There's the really big slide, remember?

1348
01:22:04.356 --> 01:22:06.526
<i>It used to be a lot bigger.</i>

1349
01:22:07.735 --> 01:22:09.315
Here's what I remember:

1350
01:22:09.405 --> 01:22:13.863
Some really bad guys
tie up that three-legged dog, Tripod.

1351
01:22:13.943 --> 01:22:15.943
When you try to stop them,
you get really thrashed.

1352
01:22:16.033 --> 01:22:18.242
<i>Oh, no. Do I save him?</i>

1353
01:22:18.322 --> 01:22:21.201
No. You go down after only one punch,

1354
01:22:21.281 --> 01:22:23.161
thereby solidifying
your reputation as a loser...

1355
01:22:23.241 --> 01:22:25.540
for the next eight years,
all the way through high school...

1356
01:22:25.620 --> 01:22:28.369
<i>and ruining our life from that moment on.</i>

1357
01:22:28.459 --> 01:22:30.918
Oh, holy smokes.

1358
01:22:30.998 --> 01:22:33.298
Any second now, Vince Kajinski
and his cohorts

01:34:43.150 --> 01:34:44.648
- You're a pilot.

1529
01:34:44.728 --> 01:34:46.226
- You're a pilot.
- No, you're a pilot.

1530
01:34:46.316 --> 01:34:48.274
- I'm a pilot.
- We grow up to be pilots!

1531
01:34:48.354 --> 01:34:51.311
We grow up to be pilots! Hey!

1532
01:34:51.401 --> 01:34:53.229
- Did you see our dog?

1533
01:34:53.309 --> 01:34:54.647
- Chester.

1534
01:34:54.727 --> 01:34:57.934

01:35:01.061 --> 01:35:03.478
- Did you see our family?
- Yeah.

1537
01:35:04.607 --> 01:35:05.646
Wild.

1538
01:35:07.684 --> 01:35:10.231
That old lady looked familiar.

1539
01:35:11.060 --> 01:35:12.787
Yeah. I thought so too.

1540
01:35:26.779 --> 01:35:30.076
- Look at us go.
- Yeah.

1541
01:35:30.157 --> 01:35:31.886
Look at us go.

1542
01:35:37.287 --> 01:35:41.676
I am not a loser!

1543
01:35:55.965 --> 01:35:57.592
Look at us go.

1544
01:36:02.594 --> 01:36:03.905
Kid?

1545
01:36:16.896 --> 01:36:18.404
Bye, kid.

1546
01:36:25.782 --> 01:36:27.089
Thanks.

1547
01:36:47.916 --> 01:36:49.215
Hello?

1548
01:36:51.135 --> 01:36:52.254
I'm here.

1549
01:36:54.463 --> 01:36:55.593
Russ?

1550
01:36:57.052 --> 01:36:58.092
Russ?

1551
01:36:58.171 --> 01:37:00.800
<i>Hi, Janet. I'm back here.
I'll be out in a second.</i>

1552
01:37:00.890 --> 01:37:04.139
Hey, a couple of questions.
Why am I not at the office?

1553
01:37:04.219 --> 01:37:06.218
<i>Why are you not at the office?</i>

1554
01:37:06.308 --> 01:37:09.307
- And where have you been?
- Did you call my dad?

1555
01:37:09.387 --> 01:37:11.516
Yes, I told him you'd be there Sunday
to help him move.

1556
01:37:11.596 --> 01:37:14.814
<i>He almost had a heart attack,
if that was your intention.</i>

1557
01:37:14.894 --> 01:37:16.853
What about the plane tickets to Hawaii?

1558
01:37:17.273 --> 01:37:20.232
I booked 'em. Two first-class seats.
You leave at 2:00.

1559
01:37:23.770 --> 01:37:25.319
Thank you. Got a pen?

1560
01:37:26.109 --> 01:37:30.147
Change these names on here.
Use my credit card.

1561
01:37:36.195 --> 01:37:37.534
Russ!

1562
01:37:37.614 --> 01:37:40.243
(LAUGHING) I love it,
I love it, I love it, I love it.

1563
01:37:40.323 --> 01:37:41.662
