00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.560
I'm sorry. I can't seem to find my purse.

2
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.560
I must have ten of them.

3
00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.560
Can you just ring mine first, please?

4
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.360
There's someone ahead of you, sir.

5
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.860
I usually keep my change in
my little change bear, but...

6
00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.490
That's almost interesting.
How much is hers?

7
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.990
- 5.26.
- Just add it on, please.

8
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.120
Hold on, hold on.

9
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.120
If it's not in this one,
it'll be in another one.

10
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.540
- That'll be 9.65.
- Thank you very much.

11
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.920
How sweet. You didn't
have to do that for me.

12
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.420
I didn't do it for you.

13
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.250
Check some bags next time.

14
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.210
(SCOFFS) Jerk.

15
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.440
- How can I help you, Governor?
- Some dirtbag...

16
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.320
dirtbag...
from the attorney general's office...

17
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.360
had dared to mention the word "jail."

18
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.240
Waaah.

19
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.330
Waaah!

20
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.750
Somebody call the "waaambulance"!

21
00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.420
What? What did you say?

22
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.090
Governor, do you know
what the number one killer...

23
00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.550
- of politicians under the age of 60 is?
<i>- No.</i>

24
00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.010
Self pity.

25
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.640
Governor, I'll be more than happy
to help you out of this mess...

26
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.060
that you so willingly
seem to have stepped into.

27
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.190
<i>- But you ought to do something.</i>
- What's that?

28
00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.520
- Stop crying.
- I'll try.

29
00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.150
<i>No, I mean right now.
You're giving me a headache.</i>

30
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.710
<i>Excuse me, folks, anything more to drink?</i>

31
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.420
Do y'all have any single-malt scotch?

32
00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:50.510
<i>Sure do.</i>

33
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.100
- So, what do you do for a living?

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.180
<i>You wanna tell me about it?</i>

35
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.100
You know, comfort of strangers
and all that.

36
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.350
No.

37
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.360
Oh. Must be something on the Internet.

38
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.320
Or finance.

39
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.410
(GASPS) Genetic engineering, maybe, huh?

40
00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.700
- I'm an image consultant, okay?
- Okay.

41
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:40.890
So you sort of troubleshoot for folks?

42
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.650
You know, give 'em makeovers
when they need revamping, right?

43
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:46.860
Right.

44
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.110
Hey, look,

45
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.410
<i>I'm flying to L.A. to start
an anchor job in the local news,</i>

46
00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.570
and I do not think that it's an accident
that I'm sitting next to you.

47
00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:58.540
I see.

48
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.750
So the cosmic purpose of our meeting
is for me to give you free advice.

49
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.420
What do I get out of it?

50
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.790
We don't know yet. But I'll owe you.

51
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.400
- If I do it, will you shut up?
- Quiet as the dead.

53
00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:32.780
Your hair's too big,

54
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.610
your brows are too dark,
your nails are too long...

55
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.610
and your foundation's too orange.

56
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.200
Your perfume's too sweet.
It's the news, honey, not the prom.

57
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.460
- I like your eyes...
- Oh. Thank you.

58
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.370
Bluer. Try the tinted contacts.

59
00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.330
But only when you're anchoring or in L.A.

60
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.090
When you're on assignment, take them out.

61
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:51.840
What about my accent?

62
00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.170
I'm always being warned
to stop saying "y'all."

63
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.720
Don't ever stop saying "y'all."
Your "y'all" is your trademark.

64
00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.560
Say "y'all," and you'll be
promoted in six months.

65
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.730
Say "y'all" with a smile,
you'll be famous in 12.

66
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.350
Well... (CHUCKLES) Thank you.

67
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.690
You're welcome.

68
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.820
Now, will you please shut up?

69
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:36.340
All right, let me have him.
Hello, Your Honor. How are you?

70
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:38.340
Good. Thank you.

71
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.050
Define "not exactly alone."

72
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.850
Your Honor, was this mannequin inflatable?

73
00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.190
You know if the press...

79
00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.260

84
00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.520
<i>I'm wearing my yellow tie?
You can't even see me.</i>

85
00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.650
I can hear the stress in your voice.

86
00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.650
Whenever you're stressed,
you wear the yellow tie,

87
00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.660
which makes you feel all-powerful,
so you're probably gonna yell at me,

88
00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.240
which I'm not in the mood for, so don't.

89
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:48.330
- Nice tie.
- I am not stressed.

90
00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.500
There is nothing wrong with me.

91
00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.040
I just didn't get enough sleep last night.

92
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:53.330
Can I have today's work, please?

93
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.590
Take your phone off.
You're with a human now.

<i>I did the ones and twos.
There's a three, a four.</i>

95

I flagged the five in your mail.

96
00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.340
There's an eight on your desk to sign.

97
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:05.050
And there's a ten standing in your office.

98
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.570
Why did you let him in my office, Janet?

99
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.280
He threatened me with a machete.

100
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.820
He's your father, Russ.

101
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.620
Wait 60 seconds and come in and tell me
I'm late for something.

102
00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:35.000

Well, it would be,

Oh.

109
00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:56.810
So, Dad, what can I do for you?

110
00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.070
Did you get the check
I sent over this morning?

111
00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:01.150
Yes, yes, I did.

112
00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.740
But I didn't ask you for a check.

113
00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.410
I asked you to come over
and help me lift a few things.

114
00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:11.830
(SIGHS) Well, time is money, Dad,

115
00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:14.210
and my time is worth
a lot more than a mover's,

116

is gonna have to do.</i>

Dozens of irate and highly
important people are clamoring for you.

Have we signed a new client?

We made a bet. I make him look handsome,
I get a free hot dog.

Besides, we're about to have
lobster in cream sauce.

I don't want lobster in cream sauce.
I want hot dog in mustard sauce.

Please stop biting your nails, Amy.

148
00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:05.740
Nail. I only bite one.
Why do you care anyway?

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:07.740
I care because you work for me.

When you bite your nails,
you're advertising weakness.

Really? Advertising weakness

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:09.130
Hi. I'm Josh, Mr. Riley's assistant.

173
00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:11.130
- If you need anything...
- I do.

174
00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:12.590
I need you to go up in the bleachers

175
00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.550
and find me a dozen 8 to 12-year-old kids.

176
00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:19.560
Eight boys, four girls.
Five white, four Latino, three black.

177
00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.100
- Have 'em back here in three minutes.
- Okay.

178
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:24.230
I need to use your Hi-8 for this one.

179
00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:26.440
So why is everybody busting my chops?

180
00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.480
And the way I see this thing,

181
00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:30.740
it's just a little misunderstanding.

182
00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:34.570
(LAUGHS) Okay, Bob,
let me see if I can explain to you...

183
00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.950
how other people see this little thing.

184
00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:39.120
You see, to Joe Baseball Fan out there,

185
00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.250
you're the guy that promised
you would give five percent...

186
00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.170
of each ticket sold this season

187
00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:45.920
to establishing a baseball
camp for inner-city kids.

188
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.920
You're also the guy that gave pictures

189
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.090
to the press of kids
actually attending this camp,

190
00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:51.840
which, in fact, does not exist.

191
00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:55.850
Yet. I was intending
to get around to it, uh, eventually.

192
00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:59.720
- Ah.
<i>- I am a very busy guy.</i>

193
00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:03.230
- (LAUGHS)
- No, Bob, you're not a busy man.

194
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:06.400
See, what you are is a "stoopid" man.

195
00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.940
A very stupid guy who only played
Mr. Charitable...

196
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:11.860
because you wanted to suck up
to City Council...

197
00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:15.450
so they'd build you
a brand-new baseball park.

198
00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:17.780
<i>But guess what. Bye-bye, ballpark.</i>

199

Hello, jail.

200
00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:24.120
So what's your big plan?

201
00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:26.210
How do you feel about chocolate cream pie?

202
00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:31.340
<i>Why? She gonna feed the kids cream pie
to get me out of this mess?</i>

203
00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:34.550
No. The kids are gonna feed you
cream pie and get you out of this mess.

204
00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:37.140
- Huh?
- Bob,

205
00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:39.140
prepare to be pied.

206
00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:42.560
- (KIDS LAUGHING)
- I deserve it!

207
00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.850
More pie in the face!

208
00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.860
Bob, the press is gonna eat this up.

209
00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:49.860
<i>Amy, what do you think?</i>

210
00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:53.280

- You want to know what I think?</i>

211
00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.740
<i>I think there's something
very creepy about all this.</i>

212
00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:59.910
Amy, Amy, I swear to you...

213
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:01.910
I will make sure that
the editing of this tape

214
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:04.040
is handled tastefully, okay?

215
00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.870
- I'm sure you will.
<i>- No, I promise.</i>

216
00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:09.460
- We didn't do anything wrong today.
- No.

217
00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:12.460
We did the right thing
by our client, Bob Riley.

218
00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:14.380
I love him.

219
00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:20.180
Russ, today we shamelessly exploited
innocent children...

220
00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.980
just to help some crook
with his cash flow problems.

221
00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:30.060
Are you gonna finish
this last piece of yellowtail?

222
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:32.690
Russ, you should be concerned
about this. You're turning 40 in...

223
00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:35.780
Thank you so much for bringing that up.
And you're not at an age...

224
00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:37.910
Yes, we both are.

225
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:39.570
We can't go around anymore

226
00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.160
talking about what we're going
to be like when we grow up.

227
00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.250
We are up.

228
00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:49.380
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

229
00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:53.090
- You finished?
- Yeah, I'm finished.

230
00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:54.300
Good.

<i>Toshiya, if you get called
a jerk four times...</i>

232
00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:01.100
in the same day, does that make it true?

233
00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:03.680
- What, only four? Did you get up late?
- Excuse me.

234
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.430
I'm asking Toshiya.

235
00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:06.980
Just four times, a pattern.

236
00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:09.440
It have to be five times to be a fact.

237
00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.190
Thank you very much.
You see? There is hope.

238
00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:13.400
Jerk.

239
00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:15.690
Thank you.

240
00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:24.950
Yo, Pedro, make sure
this gets in the trash.

241
00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.090
Yes!

242
00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:36.710
That was fantastic!

243
00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:40.550
I can't believe you just did such a...
(KISSES) fantastic thing!

244
00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:41.970
Me neither.

245
00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.810
I must be really stressed out.

246
00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.600
Probably still in there.

247

248

to look for that stinky,
fish-encrusted tape!

249
00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.900
You're right. I shouldn't go in there.

250
00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:01.240
I'm wearing a $2,000 suit.
Come on. I'll give you a boost.

251
00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:03.490
Come on, come on, come on.
Distract yourself.

252
00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:05.240
Honor your instincts. Look at the moon.

253
00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:07.950

- What? Look at what?

254
00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:09.960
Look.

255
00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:15.210
Isn't it lovely? It's big, it's beautiful,

256
00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:17.800
it's revolving around the Earth,
proving once again...

257
00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.300
that the universe
does not revolve around you.

258
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:22.930
It's worth a look, if you ask me.

259
00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:25.890
Are you looking?

260
00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:28.430
- I looked.
- Look again!

261
00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:29.980
Okay! Amy...

262
00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:32.940
Quit fooling around, all right? I looked.

263
00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:34.360
Can we go?

264
00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:38.230
- Come on, grumpy.
- Hey, will you stop?

265
00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.820
I stopped.

266
00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:43.490
I want to show you something.
Tell me if you think this is cute.

267
00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:49.950
Oh! Look at the moon!
It's so big and round,

268
00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:52.790
and when I look at it,
I'm all perky and excited!

269
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:56.000
And no one would ever know
that I'm almost 30! Ooh!

270
00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:58.840
What do you think?

271
00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:01.340
Cute or just stupid?

272
00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:09.930
You know, Russ,
just when I think I've seen the worst,

273
00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:13.310
that there's no possible way
you could be more of a jerk,

274
00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:18.360
you outdo yourself.

275
00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:21.570
And then,

276
00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:28.240
just when I'm about to leave,
you do something.

277
00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:31.950

278
00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:36.750

briefest glimpse of the kid in you.

279
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.800
That's when I decide to hang around
for five more minutes,

280
00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:44.550

281
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:47.760

get 'em on the phone
right now, and you tell them...

I want charred flesh. Do you understand?

- "Charred flesh."

Hi, Janet. It's Russ. No, no, good.

00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:04.670
Uh-huh. Nothing. Fine.

514
00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:07.470
No, I just came upstairs
to return my calls.

515
00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:10.390
You wanna hear something funny?
I was downstairs...

516
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:12.810
- and now I'm upstairs, you see...
<i>- Hey.</i>

517
00:34:12.890 --> 00:34:14.470
You dropped this.

518
00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:17.690
- (JANET) Russ, hello!
- Safety in a sandwich.

519

Safety in a sandwich. Safety!

520

Ohh.

522
00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:30.110
You are just a hallucination!

523
00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:33.200
One that is about to disappear.

524
00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:38.080
Prepare to disappear!

525
00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:44.800
You better disappear.

526
00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:48.840
I'm sitting on the floor.

527
00:34:48.930 --> 00:34:51.090
I'm taking the very powerful medication.

I've got my limits.

537
00:35:58.290 --> 00:35:59.660
Do you remember when I had you sign

538
00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:01.750
those confidentiality papers
at the office?

539
00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:04.250
- Yeah.
- And do you remember me telling you...

540
00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:06.290
that if you ever said anything

541
00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:08.170
to anyone about anything
that happens in this company...

542
00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:11.550
that I would not only sue you,
but I would bring you to financial ruin?

543
00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:13.510
Snore.

544
00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:16.300

You can, uh... You can see him?

547

Yes, I, um, can.

548
00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:45.210
You can see a little boy standing there.

<i>Yes.</i>

550
00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:50.710
I'm pretty sure.

551
00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:53.130
Okay.

552
00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:00.890
This little boy is me at age eight.

553
00:37:00.970 --> 00:37:03.390
And I want you to make him disappear.

554
00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:06.400
- He's you? At age eight?
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

555
00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:09.360
And you want me to make him disappear.

556
00:37:10.690 --> 00:37:11.820
Please.

557
00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:15.780
- How was the therapist this morning?
- Do it, Janet!

558
00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:17.660
How am I supposed to make a kid disappear?

559
00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:20.200
Hey, you are the assistant!

560
00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:22.200
Figure it out, okay?

561
00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:24.500
You yelled at me! That is great.
That... That helps.

562
00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:26.500
I feel I'm thinking more clearly.

563

I-I feel I'm just more in touch with my,
my magic assistant powers.

- Hi.
- Didn't work.

I should've worn my magic bra and panties.

00:37:45.890 --> 00:37:47.150
Get in the car.

569
00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:52.280
- I'm really disappointed in you, Janet.
- Oh, fired, I hope.

570
00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:55.780
- No. Forget about your bonus.
- Oh, boo hoo. What about my dental?

571
00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:58.820
My boss appears to have lost his mind.

00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:50.930
Did he invite you up
for a little bit of cheese?

685
00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:53.470
Did he blow fart bubbles
out of his butt, huh?

686
00:43:53.550 --> 00:43:54.600
Because if he didn't,

687
00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:56.930
then there really isn't any reason
to be excited about the moon,

688
00:43:57.010 --> 00:44:01.270
<i>- is there?</i>
- Sorry. I'll never get excited again.

689
00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:03.350
Obviously.

690
00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:06.270
<i>Wait!</i>

691
00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:08.610
Can I ask you a question?

692
00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:14.320
Why does the moon get
like orangey sometimes?

693
00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:20.500
Because there is a, uh...

694
00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:24.380
a band of, uh...

695
00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:34.550
Just shut up and go to sleep, okay?

696
00:44:34.970 --> 00:44:37.140
Or better yet, go away!

697
00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:41.560

Call me Vivian.

708
00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:37.110
Okay. Vivian.

709
00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:39.530
You're going public, you're making an IPO,

710
00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:41.540
your software's brilliant,
and that's all great.

711
00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:44.710
But if you wanna make Fortune 500,
you have to understand...

712
00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:47.080
that at a certain point, people are
gonna want to get a good look at you.

713
00:45:47.170 --> 00:45:49.080
And that's where things
get a little dicey.

714
00:45:49.170 --> 00:45:51.880
Dicey. That's right. Very, very dicey.

715
00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:54.470
I don't see why I have to change a thing.

716
00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:57.590
Okay. Let's look at this.

Let me give it to you straight, Z.Z.

00:47:15.130 --> 00:47:16.130

<i>- Your nephew?</i>
- Yes. My sister's kid.

744
00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:23.390
No. The other one.

00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:29.640
Yes, Amy. This is Melissa.

747
00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:31.650
(WHISPERING) No, it is the other one.

748
00:47:31.730 --> 00:47:34.900
- The one she doesn't like to talk about.
- Oh, I see.

749
00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:37.150
Which completely explains
why you never told me about him.

750
00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:39.740
Maybe I don't tell you every thing.

751

<i>So are you having fun with your uncle?</i>

752
00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:48.200
Not really. He made me sleep outside,

<i>he didn't give me any breakfast,</i>

754
00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:52.670
and he doesn't have a dog.

755
00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:54.670
That is a problem.

756
00:47:54.750 --> 00:47:57.500
- You made him sleep outside?
- He slept in a tent.

757
00:47:57.590 --> 00:47:59.720
- You've got a tent?
- It was his tent.

758
00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:02.180
You didn't give him any breakfast.

759
00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:05.260
He can stand to miss a meal.

760
00:48:06.810 --> 00:48:10.850
Rusty, are you hungry?

761
00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:14.020
- Starved.
- Let's go and get some bacon and eggs.

762
00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:16.360

Rusty can't have bacon and eggs.

I bet she likes dogs.

770
00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:41.880
I don't know what's worse.
The fact that I'm stuck with you...

771
00:48:41.970 --> 00:48:43.880
or the idea that I don't
know what to do about it.

772
00:48:43.970 --> 00:48:45.890
Why don't we eat something?

773
00:48:45.970 --> 00:48:49.680
Why? Because you don't know what to do,
you just wanna stuff your face?

774
00:48:49.770 --> 00:48:53.310
No, because it says to

01:12:32.690 --> 01:12:35.560
I mean, you're obviously in trouble.
He'd straighten you out.

1191
01:12:35.650 --> 01:12:37.980
You think he's here to straighten <i>me</i> out?

1192
01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:39.990
Well, of course.

1193
01:12:40.570 --> 01:12:42.610
You didn't think it was
the other way around, did you?

1194
01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:49.700
Maybe he's here for you to teach him
some things.

1195
01:12:49.790 --> 01:12:54.040
But maybe he's here for you
to <i>remember</i> some things.

1196
01:12:54.250 --> 01:12:55.580
Ever thought about that?

1197
01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:01.760
Not until just now, no.

1198
01:13:02.510 --> 01:13:04.130
Darlin', look...

1199
01:13:06.050 --> 01:13:08.260
You're turnin' 40 tomorrow.

1200
01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:13.890
You haven't acquired a single thing
of real value in your life...

1201
01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:15.940
- Hey...
- And no, no, money doesn't count.

1202
01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:20.650
You're virtually friendless,
you barely talk to your family,

1203
01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:22.610
and you've just lost the only
woman in the world

1204
01:13:22.700 --> 01:13:24.150
who's ever meant anything to you.

1205
01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:27.870
Who, Amy? Please.

1206
01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:31.830
Look, she's not the only woman
in the world, okay?

1207
01:13:31.910 --> 01:13:33.910
She... She works for me.

1208
01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.040
She's neurotic. She bites her nails.

1209
01:13:37.130 --> 01:13:38.380
Nail.

1210
01:13:41.210 --> 01:13:42.550
This one.

1211
01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:46.300
Oh, my God.

1212
01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:55.440
Excuse me. Um, while he's gettin' a clue,
could I get a warmup, please?

1213
01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:57.100
Thank you.

1214
01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:02.110
Okay, don't stop. Go on.

1215
01:14:02.190 --> 01:14:04.240
What's it like?

1216
01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:06.860
He keeps asking about his future.

1217
01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:09.740
My past. Haven't really told him much.

1218
01:14:09.830 --> 01:14:11.830
- Good.
- Good?

1219
01:14:11.910 --> 01:14:13.290
You think that's good?

1220
01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:16.420
Why? What would you do?

1221
01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:19.500
If little Deirdre was suddenly here?

1222
01:14:19.590 --> 01:14:23.460
Burstin' out of her St. Mary's uniform
askin' <i>me</i> what comes next?

1223
01:14:23.550 --> 01:14:24.760
Yeah.

1224
01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:28.090
I'd say, "Baby,

1225
01:14:28.510 --> 01:14:30.600
don't you worry about a thing.

1226
01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:33.270
Everything is just gonna be great."

1227
01:14:35.390 --> 01:14:37.270
I mean, how many of us turn out the way...

1228
01:14:37.350 --> 01:14:40.110
we think we will when we're kids, really?

1229
01:14:42.150 --> 01:14:46.320
I mean, how many of us
grow up to be astronauts?

1230
01:14:46.570 --> 01:14:49.740
Or prima ballerinas?

1231
01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:55.450
We just all do the best we can.

1232
01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:07.220
Time for me to take big Deirdre home.

1233
01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:09.180
(MOUTHS WORDS)

1234
01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:10.470
You know, if you want to learn

1235
01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:12.100
about your childhood,
seems like you're on line...

1236
01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:14.640
with a pretty good source,
you know what I mean?

1237
01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:16.640
Yes, I am.

1238
01:15:17.940 --> 01:15:20.350
Deirdre, thanks
for taking the time to help.

1239
01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:25.030
Well, don't ever stop
asking for help, Russ.

1240
01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:28.360
You just might get it.

1241
01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:33.370
- Thanks.
- You take care.

1242
01:15:34.990 --> 01:15:36.250
Bye, y'all.

1243
01:15:37.910 --> 01:15:39.330
Bye.

1244
01:15:52.390 --> 01:15:55.810
<i>Hi, Janet, it's me.
I'm sorry to call so late.</i>

1245
01:15:55.890 --> 01:15:57.930
It's okay, Russ. I think I'll recover.

1246
01:15:58.020 --> 01:16:00.100
I just want you to cancel
all my appointments tomorrow

1247
01:16:00.190 --> 01:16:01.600
and move them to Friday.

1248
01:16:01.690 --> 01:16:04.480
- Anything else?
- No, that's it.

1249
01:16:05.150 --> 01:16:07.400
<i>- Okay, you got it.
- No, wait.</i>

1250
01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:09.900
There is something else.

1251
01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:13.660
I want you to find out
why the full moon looks orange

1252
01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:16.160
sometimes when it rises.

1253
01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:20.660
<i>- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks, Janet. Good night.</i>

1254
01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:41.350
<i>Hey, kid. Rusty.</i>

1255
01:16:43.730 --> 01:16:47.360
- Hi.
- Hi.

1256
01:16:49.230 --> 01:16:50.820
Wanna help me with something?

1257
01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:53.860
<i>I think it might get you back
to your time.</i>

1258
01:16:53.950 --> 01:16:54.990
Sure.

1259
01:16:55.820 --> 01:16:57.200
Good.

1260
01:16:59.410 --> 01:17:01.410
Anything about me?

1261
01:17:02.250 --> 01:17:05.080
Yeah. Anything that'll take me back.

1262
01:17:05.170 --> 01:17:07.170
Hmm.

1263
01:17:07.250 --> 01:17:09.880
You know how I like
to find caterpillars...

1264
01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:12.470
and put them in jars and feed 'em...

1265
01:17:13.050 --> 01:17:15.510
and watch 'em make cocoons?

1266
01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:20.850
No.

1267
01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:23.440
And then one day,

1268
01:17:23.730 --> 01:17:26.270
they break out and it's really cool.

1269
01:17:28.730 --> 01:17:30.400
No. Not a clue.

1270
01:17:31.110 --> 01:17:33.360
But keep going. Tell me some more stuff.

1271
01:17:33.610 --> 01:17:36.370
Remember last summer
at Josie's birthday party...

1272
01:17:36.450 --> 01:17:39.280
when I got Parmesan cheese
stuck up my nose?

1273
01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:43.330
<i>Got any sixes?</i>

1274
01:17:43.410 --> 01:17:45.250
Nope. Go fish.

1275
01:17:46.830 --> 01:17:48.000
Any fours?

1276
01:17:48.090 --> 01:17:50.300
Negative. Go fish.

1277
01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:55.300
Got any sevens?

1278
01:17:58.260 --> 01:18:00.180
Tell me some more about Dad.

1279
01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:03.600
Sometimes...

1280
01:18:04.350 --> 01:18:06.440
he lets me help him work on the car.

1281
01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:08.560
If I do something wrong...

1282
01:18:08.650 --> 01:18:10.690
he yells at me.

1283
01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:14.900
<i>Sometimes he buys me ice cream afterwards.</i>

1284
01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:18.370
<i>But still, I don't like messing up.</i>

1285
01:18:19.410 --> 01:18:20.870
Like last week...

1286
01:18:20.950 --> 01:18:22.740
I lost a screw.

1287
01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:25.790
I was afraid to tell him.

1288
01:18:27.420 --> 01:18:29.750
<i>I found it later on in my pocket.</i>

1289
01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:32.550
Look, I still have it.

1290
01:18:38.050 --> 01:18:40.640
<i>I'm afraid to give it back to him.</i>

1291
01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:44.350
Got any nines?

1292
01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:49.770
No.

1293
01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:53.900
My homeroom teacher last year
was fat Mrs. Kinkelman.

1294
01:18:53.980 --> 01:18:56.610
She was so much better than Mr. Lupus.

1295
01:18:56.700 --> 01:18:59.030
He had that purple bump on his face.

1296
01:18:59.110 --> 01:19:01.620
I don't remember the bump guy.
What grade was that?

1297
01:19:01.700 --> 01:19:03.660
How come you're asking me all this stuff?

1298
01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:05.910
'Cause I'm forgetting something.

1299
01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.540
I'm forgetting this one event
that meant something to me...

1300
01:19:08.620 --> 01:19:11.630
and if I can remember that one thing,
maybe I can get you home.

1301
01:19:11.710 --> 01:19:14.050
Are you sure it's not the purple bump?

1302
01:19:14.130 --> 01:19:16.970
- It's not the bump, kid.
- It was a pretty big bump.

1303
01:19:17.050 --> 01:19:18.800
- Tell me more about second grade.
- Why?

1304
01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:21.220
Nobody had a bump in second grade.

1305
01:19:23.310 --> 01:19:26.680
My best friend was Tim Wheaton,
until a few months ago.

1306
01:19:26.770 --> 01:19:28.520
Remember him?

1307
01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:30.400
No, I don't.

1308
01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:33.940
- His house smells like fish sticks.
- No.

1309
01:19:34.020 --> 01:19:35.400
Well, he was my best friend

1310
01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:37.950
until he started hanging out with Vince...

1311
01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:40.660
and these other creepy guys.

1312
01:19:40.740 --> 01:19:44.160
He threw a rock at me
and we haven't been friends since then.

1313
01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:47.160
- He threw a rock at us?
- Oh, yeah.

1314
01:19:47.250 --> 01:19:50.170
<i>- Why? What happened?</i>
- Oh, those guys get together...

1315
01:19:50.250 --> 01:19:52.830
every recess in the corner
of the playground yard...

1316
01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:54.920
where they like to pick on kids.

1317
01:19:56.380 --> 01:19:58.510
Back behind the kindergarten.

1318
01:19:59.340 --> 01:20:02.010
Yeah. Where the yard monitor
can't see you!

1319
01:20:02.090 --> 01:20:04.600
- Where that big sliding board is?
- Yeah, the really huge one!

1320
01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:06.680
- You remember it!
- Go on. Don't stop.

1321
01:20:06.770 --> 01:20:09.770
There's four of them,
and if they don't like you...

1322
01:20:09.850 --> 01:20:12.270
they make your life a nightmare!

1323
01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:22.990
And the worst thing about them
is they're really mean to animals.

1324
01:20:23.070 --> 01:20:25.330
Especially this one three-legged dog.

1325
01:20:25.410 --> 01:20:27.450
<i>(BARKING)</i>

1326
01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:28.750
Tripod!

1327
01:20:29.620 --> 01:20:32.080
Tripod! The dog's name is Tripod!

1328
01:20:32.170 --> 01:20:35.130
<i>I know the dog's name!
I know everything, kid.</i>

1329
01:20:35.210 --> 01:20:37.340
I know why you're here! This is the event!

1330
01:20:37.420 --> 01:20:39.720
<i>Vince Kajinski, the fight! The fight!</i>

1331
01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:43.800
It was my eighth birthday.
It was 32 years ago.

1332
01:20:43.890 --> 01:20:46.510
Today! Ha, Ha, Ha!

1333
01:20:53.230 --> 01:20:55.360
Holy smokes.

1334
01:20:58.110 --> 01:21:00.150
Look at the car!

1335
01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:04.110
Look at your clothes!

1336
01:21:06.990 --> 01:21:09.580
(WHISPERING) Holy smokes.

1337
01:21:10.700 --> 01:21:13.290
- Holy smokes!
- Holy smokes!

1338
01:21:13.370 --> 01:21:17.590
- We did it, kid!
- Am I home! Is it really 1968?

1339
01:21:22.340 --> 01:21:24.930
No doubt about it, kid.
What time's recess?

1340
01:21:25.010 --> 01:21:27.930
- 10:30.
- Hang on, kid.

1341
01:21:28.010 --> 01:21:30.310
We've got 15 minutes to change our life.

1342
01:21:30.390 --> 01:21:32.850
Okay, now listen.
This is gonna happen real fast,

1343
01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:34.600
so you gotta remember
what Kenny told you, all right:

1344
01:21:34.690 --> 01:21:35.940
one, two, one, two.

1345
01:21:36.020 --> 01:21:39.020
- One, two...
- Keep your head down, keep swingin'.

1346
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:41.740
<i>(BELL RINGING)</i>

1347
01:21:48.910 --> 01:21:51.910
Look, look, look!
There's the really big slide, remember?

1348
01:21:54.540 --> 01:21:56.710
<i>It used to be a lot bigger.</i>

1349
01:21:57.920 --> 01:21:59.500
Here's what I remember:

1350
01:21:59.590 --> 01:22:04.050
Some really bad guys
tie up that three-legged dog, Tripod.

1351
01:22:04.130 --> 01:22:06.130
When you try to stop them,
you get really thrashed.

1352
01:22:06.220 --> 01:22:08.430
<i>Oh, no. Do I save him?</i>

1353
01:22:08.510 --> 01:22:11.390
No. You go down after only one punch,

1354
01:22:11.470 --> 01:22:13.350
thereby solidifying
your reputation as a loser...

1355
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:15.730
for the next eight years,
all the way through high school...

1356
01:22:15.810 --> 01:22:18.560
<i>and ruining our life from that moment on.</i>

1357
01:22:18.650 --> 01:22:21.110
Oh, holy smokes.

1358
01:22:21.190 --> 01:22:23.490
Any second now, Vince Kajinski
and his cohorts

01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:34.800
- You're a pilot.

1529
01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:36.380
- You're a pilot.
- No, you're a pilot.

1530
01:34:36.470 --> 01:34:38.430
- I'm a pilot.
- We grow up to be pilots!

1531
01:34:38.510 --> 01:34:41.470
We grow up to be pilots! Hey!

1532
01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:43.390
- Did you see our dog?
- What's his name?

1533
01:34:43.470 --> 01:34:44.810
- Chester.
- Chester.

1534
01:34:44.890 --> 01:34:48.100
- The world's greatest dog!
- The world's greatest dog!

1535
01:34:48.190 --> 01:34:51.150
Yes! Hoo-Ha, Hoo-Ha... (CHANTING)

1536
01:34:51.230 --> 01:34:53.650
- Did you see our family?
- Yeah.

1537
01:34:54.780 --> 01:34:55.820
Wild.

1538
01:34:57.860 --> 01:35:00.410
That old lady looked familiar.

1539
01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:02.990
Yeah. I thought so too.

1540
01:35:17.170 --> 01:35:20.430
- Look at us go.
- Yeah.

1541
01:35:20.510 --> 01:35:22.220
Look at us go.

1542
01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:31.940
I am not a loser!

1543
01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:47.830
Look at us go.

1544
01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:54.170
Kid?

1545
01:36:07.350 --> 01:36:08.850
Bye, kid.

1546
01:36:16.190 --> 01:36:17.490
Thanks.

1547
01:36:38.210 --> 01:36:39.510
Hello?

1548
01:36:41.430 --> 01:36:42.550
I'm here.

1549
01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:45.890
Russ?

1550
01:36:47.350 --> 01:36:48.390
Russ?

1551
01:36:48.470 --> 01:36:51.100
<i>Hi, Janet. I'm back here.
I'll be out in a second.</i>

1552
01:36:51.190 --> 01:36:54.440
Hey, a couple of questions.
Why am I not at the office?

1553
01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:56.520
<i>Why are you not at the office?</i>

1554
01:36:56.610 --> 01:36:59.610
- And where have you been?
- Did you call my dad?

1555
01:36:59.690 --> 01:37:01.820
Yes, I told him you'd be there Sunday
to help him move.

1556
01:37:01.900 --> 01:37:05.120
<i>He almost had a heart attack,
if that was your intention.</i>

1557
01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:07.160
What about the plane tickets to Hawaii?

1558
01:37:07.580 --> 01:37:10.540
I booked 'em. Two first-class seats.
You leave at 2:00.

1559
01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:15.630
Thank you. Got a pen?

1560
01:37:16.420 --> 01:37:20.460
Change these names on here.
Use my credit card.

1561
01:37:26.510 --> 01:37:27.850
Russ!

1562
01:37:27.930 --> 01:37:30.560
(LAUGHING) I love it,
I love it, I love it, I love it.

1563
01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:31.980
Aloha, Janet.

01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:35.860
I love Hawaii. I love Hawaii!
