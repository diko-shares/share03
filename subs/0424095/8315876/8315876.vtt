00:01:11.984 --> 00:01:16.080
- Car's here!
- It's 9:00! We'll miss our flight!

2
00:01:16.154 --> 00:01:18.952
- Traveler's checks...
- You have the tickets?

3
00:01:19.024 --> 00:01:21.049
- Tabitha, did you feed Roddy?
- Oops.

4
00:01:21.126 --> 00:01:23.617
I just know we've forgotten something.

5
00:01:23.695 --> 00:01:25.925
Roddy, where are you?

6
00:01:26.265 --> 00:01:30.463
We'll be back in a few days, so here's
enough food for you. Here's more.

7
00:01:30.535 --> 00:01:32.298
- Tabitha!
- Here's a little more.

8
00:01:32.371 --> 00:01:35.636
- I hope you're not overfeeding him.
- Of course not, Mum.

9
00:01:35.707 --> 00:01:37.470
- Come on, Tabitha!
- Bye, Roddy.

10
00:01:37.542 --> 00:01:41.569
- We don't want to miss our holiday.
- I'm coming, I'm coming!

11
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.724
When the cat's away...

12
00:01:53.792 --> 00:01:56.454
...the mice will play!

13
00:01:56.528 --> 00:01:58.962
The holiday starts now, everyone!

14
00:01:59.231 --> 00:02:00.926
Music, maestro!

15
00:02:08.006 --> 00:02:12.136
Hey, what are you all standing
around for? I got a big day planned!

16
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.178
Let's go, people! Chop-chop!

17
00:02:16.615 --> 00:02:19.277
Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.

18
00:02:19.351 --> 00:02:21.512
Nope. Nope. Nope.

19
00:02:27.107 --> 00:02:28.227
Mm.

20
00:02:32.931 --> 00:02:35.024
Buckle up, everyone.

21
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:46.968
Fore!

22
00:02:50.382 --> 00:02:52.145
Oops. Sorry.

23
00:02:56.421 --> 00:02:57.888
Game point. Service!

24
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.554
We win! We win, team! We win!

25
00:03:14.406 --> 00:03:15.498
Perfect.

26
00:03:32.991 --> 00:03:35.084
Having a good time, darling?

27
00:03:41.867 --> 00:03:43.357
Thank you.

28
00:03:46.371 --> 00:03:47.861
See you tomorrow.

29
00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:01.847
Good night!

30
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.582
Good night! Good night!

31
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.893
Yeah, well. Good night then, Roddy.

32
00:04:20.338 --> 00:04:21.999
What was that?

33
00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:25.240
Who's there?

34
00:04:26.244 --> 00:04:29.577
Wake up.
I think there's someone in the house.

35
00:04:29.648 --> 00:04:31.582
Sarge, wake up!

36
00:04:33.084 --> 00:04:35.575
<i>Approaching enemy lines.</i>

37
00:04:41.893 --> 00:04:45.385
<i>- I'm armed and ready.</i>
- At ease, soldier.

38
00:04:45.464 --> 00:04:48.228
<i>Give up your weapons
of mass destruction.</i>

39
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.895
<i>Come get me, enemy of freedom!
I'm armed and ready.</i>

40
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.936
<i>Tell Mom l...love...her.</i>

41
00:05:10.467 --> 00:05:12.287
Yee-ha!

42
00:05:45.323 --> 00:05:48.486
They do not, repeat, not,
have food like this in the sewer.

43
00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.094
A sewer rat!

44
00:05:50.495 --> 00:05:53.123
Who... What... How did you get here?

45
00:05:53.198 --> 00:05:58.158
I don't know. One minute I'm in the pub.
Next thing you know, whoosh!

46
00:05:58.236 --> 00:06:02.502
It's a burst water main!
Off I go, shooting up the pipes.

47
00:06:02.574 --> 00:06:05.134
And, well, here I am.

48
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.906
I have a plunger.
We can shoot you right back.

49
00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:11.980
Do you like seafood?

50
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:13.415
Can I call you a cab?

51
00:06:13.634 --> 00:06:14.454
Blah!

52
00:06:14.519 --> 00:06:16.350
See food! Get it?

53
00:06:17.324 --> 00:06:19.024
Have you got a TV?

54
00:06:19.257 --> 00:06:21.316
- Yes, but...
- Say no more!

55
00:06:21.393 --> 00:06:23.258
No. Leave that.

56
00:06:23.328 --> 00:06:24.727
Geronimo!

57
00:06:24.796 --> 00:06:27.060
No, don't... touch anything.

58
00:06:27.132 --> 00:06:30.533
Would you look at the size
of that monster?!

59
00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:37.599
Careful, mate.
Those aren't chocolate buttons.

60
00:06:39.311 --> 00:06:43.077
<i>It's the match of the century!
The FlFA World Cup Final!</i>

61
00:06:43.148 --> 00:06:45.514
<i>- England. Germany.</i>
- Yes! Boo!

62
00:06:45.584 --> 00:06:47.552
<i>Live this Sunday. Be there.</i>

63
00:06:47.619 --> 00:06:51.111
This place is great!
I'm staying here forever!

64
00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:52.656
What?

65
00:06:54.826 --> 00:06:56.225
Game point. Service!

66
00:06:56.761 --> 00:07:00.561
We win, we win!
You lose! In your face!

67
00:07:08.106 --> 00:07:13.467
Right, my friend. You don't belong here.
I'm afraid it's time for you to leave.

68
00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:17.690
I would not do that if I was you, pal.

69
00:07:17.882 --> 00:07:21.716
Let me lay this out for you.
This place is mine now.

70
00:07:21.786 --> 00:07:25.813
Sid says, "Jump," you say,
"How high?" Comprende?

71
00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:29.792
Fetch us some Pop-Tarts from the
kitchen, Jeeves. Be snappy about it.

72
00:07:32.097 --> 00:07:34.156
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

73
00:07:34.232 --> 00:07:35.756
That's more like it.

74
00:07:35.834 --> 00:07:39.031
But before breakfast is served...

75
00:07:39.104 --> 00:07:42.835
...perhaps sir would care
to take a whirl in the Jacuzzi.

76
00:07:42.907 --> 00:07:45.637
A Jacuzzi?

77
00:07:49.014 --> 00:07:50.538
You're a real gent.

78
00:07:50.615 --> 00:07:52.947
After a hard day
navigating sewer pipes,

79
00:07:53.018 --> 00:07:57.682
there's nothing better than relaxing
in a Jacuzzi whirlpool bath.

80
00:07:57.756 --> 00:08:00.281
That looks so inviting.

81
00:08:00.358 --> 00:08:02.656
Yes. The water looks perfect!

82
00:08:02.727 --> 00:08:07.130
Now you hop in, and I'll press
this lever to get the bubbles going.

83
00:08:07.198 --> 00:08:09.462
Right. In we go!

84
00:08:10.802 --> 00:08:12.599
Oh! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

85
00:08:12.671 --> 00:08:14.798
I know we got off
on the wrong foot before,

86
00:08:14.873 --> 00:08:17.501
but I think we're
gonna get along, don't you?

87
00:08:17.575 --> 00:08:19.042
Swimmingly.

88
00:08:21.413 --> 00:08:22.471
Be seeing you.

89
00:08:25.717 --> 00:08:26.741
You plonker!

90
00:08:27.218 --> 00:08:29.846
You think I don't know a toilet
when I see one?

91
00:08:29.921 --> 00:08:32.185
You were going to flush me down the loo.

92
00:08:32.257 --> 00:08:34.521
No! It's a big Jacuzzi! Deluxe model!

93
00:08:34.592 --> 00:08:37.356
Then you won't mind
if I get the bubbles going.

94
00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:40.796
No! Not the lever!
Have mercy! No, I can't swim!

95
00:08:40.865 --> 00:08:43.099
Bon voyage, me old cream cracker!

96
00:08:43.368 --> 00:08:45.461
- Hold your nose!
- You can't do this!

97
00:08:45.537 --> 00:08:49.496
You were going to try to flush me.
Let's see how you like it.

98
00:09:12.931 --> 00:09:14.558
Have you seen my dad?

99
00:09:21.419 --> 00:09:22.819
Ah!

100
00:09:51.669 --> 00:09:54.729
Oh, no, I can't swim!
I can't swim! I can't...

101
00:09:55.907 --> 00:09:57.306
...swim.

102
00:10:00.245 --> 00:10:02.611
I'm... in... the sewer!

103
00:10:22.267 --> 00:10:23.598
Hello?

104
00:10:25.937 --> 00:10:27.131
Help?

105
00:10:29.941 --> 00:10:33.104
I'm gonna open my eyes and be home.
This is all a bad dream.

106
00:10:33.845 --> 00:10:35.506
I'm not home! I wanna go home!

107
00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:37.445
Shush! Stop it. Roddy!

108
00:10:37.515 --> 00:10:39.983
I want to go home!
Pull yourself together!

109
00:10:40.051 --> 00:10:41.916
I can't. I'm frightened.

110
00:10:41.986 --> 00:10:44.045
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

111
00:10:44.122 --> 00:10:49.287
All right, Roddy, old man, you can
get yourself out of here, and you will.

112
00:10:50.128 --> 00:10:51.356
Never forget,

113
00:10:51.429 --> 00:10:55.126
the blood of the courageous
James clan flows through your veins.

114
00:11:10.815 --> 00:11:12.806
Extra! Extra!

115
00:11:14.185 --> 00:11:15.516
Read all about it!

116
00:11:17.021 --> 00:11:18.648
A way out! Yes!

117
00:11:29.234 --> 00:11:31.964
Hey! That took me 3 years to draw!

118
00:11:32.036 --> 00:11:34.436
I'm terribly sorry. Three years?

119
00:11:34.505 --> 00:11:36.564
I just finished it this morning!

120
00:11:36.641 --> 00:11:39.235
Three years?

121
00:11:39.677 --> 00:11:43.010
Good grief!

122
00:11:50.288 --> 00:11:52.552
- What is this place?
- Hold the bus!

123
00:11:52.624 --> 00:11:56.116
Feed the flies! Tuppence a bag!

124
00:12:03.234 --> 00:12:04.701
It's a real city!

125
00:12:10.608 --> 00:12:11.939
My smalls!

126
00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:13.739
- Is it a bird?
- Is it a plane?

127
00:12:13.811 --> 00:12:16.211
Is that guy wearing my underpants?

128
00:12:16.281 --> 00:12:17.714
Make him move, honey.

129
00:12:17.782 --> 00:12:20.307
Boy, you got a face like a frying pan!

130
00:12:20.385 --> 00:12:23.218
- Come on!
- I don't think he speaks English.

131
00:12:23.288 --> 00:12:25.452
He moved! Did you get it?

132
00:12:26.391 --> 00:12:28.154
- Got it!
- Good.

133
00:12:28.226 --> 00:12:30.217
Sorry, sorry.

134
00:12:30.295 --> 00:12:32.889
- It's coming!
- What? Where? Who?

135
00:12:32.964 --> 00:12:34.556
The Great Flood!

136
00:12:34.632 --> 00:12:39.365
Those floodgates won't hold forever,
you know! We're doomed!

137
00:12:39.437 --> 00:12:41.928
You think you can back away
from the truth!

138
00:12:42.006 --> 00:12:44.736
'Ello, hello, hello.
What's all this then?

139
00:12:44.809 --> 00:12:48.404
Thank heavens! A policeman!
This wacko has been chasing after me!

140
00:12:48.479 --> 00:12:49.741
'Morning, Harold.

141
00:12:49.814 --> 00:12:52.442
- 'Morning, Collin. How are you?
- Can't complain.

142
00:12:52.517 --> 00:12:55.645
Keep an eye on this one.
He's a bit of a loony.

143
00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:57.119
We're doomed!

144
00:12:57.188 --> 00:12:58.883
- Are you kidding me?
- Right.

145
00:12:58.957 --> 00:13:02.017
- Let's give you a police escort home.
- Great!

146
00:13:02.093 --> 00:13:06.359
I live in Kensington.
Up there. The surface.

147
00:13:06.431 --> 00:13:09.662
Up Top? Oh, no. No, no, no.

148
00:13:09.734 --> 00:13:12.259
The humans don't like our sort.

149
00:13:12.337 --> 00:13:16.330
Speak for yourself.
They like me very much up there.

150
00:13:16.407 --> 00:13:21.377
I don't like your attitude.
I've got my eye on you, sunshine.

151
00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:27.509
You're trying to get Up Top, me hearty?

152
00:13:28.786 --> 00:13:30.400
Yes.

153
00:13:31.856 --> 00:13:36.623
There's one person 'round here
might be able to help you. Might.

154
00:13:36.694 --> 00:13:37.820
Really?

155
00:13:37.895 --> 00:13:41.956
Shady customer.
The captain of the Jammy Dodger.

156
00:13:42.033 --> 00:13:46.163
- If you can find it.
- I know where it is!

157
00:13:52.877 --> 00:13:57.974
And remember,
the name of the boat's the Jammy Dodger.

158
00:13:58.049 --> 00:14:00.711
Thanks for bringing me this far.

159
00:14:00.785 --> 00:14:03.219
You're welcome.

160
00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:05.720
See ya!

161
00:14:20.238 --> 00:14:22.069
Beware.

162
00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:23.903
Beware.

163
00:14:28.046 --> 00:14:29.411
Hello?

164
00:14:30.248 --> 00:14:32.375
Permission to come aboard?

165
00:14:34.285 --> 00:14:36.082
Ahoy there?

166
00:15:01.446 --> 00:15:05.041
Sorry. I didn't mean to intrude,
Mr. Captain, Skipper, Thingy.

167
00:15:05.116 --> 00:15:08.950
Hey! That's Miss Captain
Skipper Thingy to you.

168
00:15:09.643 --> 00:15:12.168
- Oops.
- What are you doing in my boat?

169
00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:14.158
I've had a bad day and need your help.

170
00:15:14.225 --> 00:15:17.217
I was thrown out of my own home,
flushed down my own toilet.

171
00:15:17.295 --> 00:15:20.355
Thank you, too much information.
I have my own problems.

172
00:15:20.431 --> 00:15:23.025
She's around here somewhere!

173
00:15:23.101 --> 00:15:25.467
Stay down. And keep quiet.

174
00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.735
Why? Who are we hiding from?

175
00:15:30.808 --> 00:15:34.369
I said quiet! There's rats after me
who'd like to kill me.

176
00:15:34.445 --> 00:15:37.772
Well, I'll contain my amazement.

177
00:15:37.915 --> 00:15:41.316
All right, all right. Quiet as a mouse.

178
00:15:49.494 --> 00:15:51.325
Over there!

179
00:15:51.395 --> 00:15:52.987
You idiot!

180
00:15:53.064 --> 00:15:54.497
Sorry about that.

181
00:15:54.565 --> 00:15:56.499
I'll be off then.

182
00:15:56.834 --> 00:15:57.965
Sorry.

183
00:15:57.979 --> 00:15:59.099
Ah!

184
00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:01.161
Sorry. Sorry.

185
00:16:01.506 --> 00:16:02.734
Sorry!

186
00:16:02.807 --> 00:16:04.274
We can't let her get away!

187
00:16:07.345 --> 00:16:10.508
Come on, Jammy,
me old mate, don't do this to me!

188
00:16:21.359 --> 00:16:24.351
Let me go, you pink-eyed freak!

189
00:16:24.428 --> 00:16:26.191
I'm upset now.

190
00:16:27.255 --> 00:16:30.855
Whatever's going on, I'm not involved.

191
00:16:30.868 --> 00:16:32.629
I'm an innocent bystander!

192
00:16:33.371 --> 00:16:36.033
Rita, Rita, Rita!

193
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:41.772
You thought you could give us the slip.

194
00:16:44.048 --> 00:16:47.711
What are you looking at?
Keep still! Come on, then! Right!

195
00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.520
Who have we got here?

196
00:16:51.589 --> 00:16:55.116
I believe he said
his name was Millicent Bystander.

197
00:16:55.152 --> 00:16:57.416
- Millicent!
- Actually, no...

198
00:16:58.062 --> 00:17:01.327
Now, then, where's the ruby, Rita?

199
00:17:01.399 --> 00:17:03.094
The boss wants it back.

200
00:17:03.167 --> 00:17:05.158
I don't have your stupid ruby.

201
00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:08.903
OK, are we going to do it
the easy way...

202
00:17:08.973 --> 00:17:10.702
...or the hard way?

203
00:17:10.775 --> 00:17:13.573
I think we should do it
the easy way, don't you, Spike?

204
00:17:16.581 --> 00:17:19.175
All right. Check the tin.

205
00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:20.979
Good girl.

206
00:17:21.052 --> 00:17:22.747
See, Whitey, this is how I do it.

207
00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:25.652
Watch and learn, my son. Watch and...

208
00:17:31.596 --> 00:17:32.722
Was it in there?

209
00:17:32.797 --> 00:17:35.357
Right! Rip it up, lads!

210
00:17:37.068 --> 00:17:40.367
Hey, you get
your filthy paws off my stuff!

211
00:17:42.306 --> 00:17:45.707
It's in here somewhere.
I can feel it in me guts!

212
00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:47.710
That'll be last night's curry.

213
00:17:47.778 --> 00:17:50.770
I'm the same.
I got a bum like the Japanese flag.

214
00:17:50.848 --> 00:17:53.715
Will you please tell them
I'm not involved in this?

215
00:17:53.784 --> 00:17:56.048
Fine. All right, all right, listen up.

216
00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.315
This gentleman,
he's not from around here.

217
00:17:58.389 --> 00:17:59.378
Thank you.

218
00:17:59.457 --> 00:18:02.119
- Just look how nicely he's dressed.
- Thank you.

219
00:18:02.193 --> 00:18:05.287
And why? Because he's
an international jewel thief!

220
00:18:05.363 --> 00:18:07.729
Precisely. What? No, no!

221
00:18:07.798 --> 00:18:10.892
- He stole the ruby from me!
- No, she's lying!

222
00:18:10.968 --> 00:18:14.563
All right, all right!
It's time to bring out...

223
00:18:14.639 --> 00:18:16.800
...the Persuader.

224
00:18:19.143 --> 00:18:21.407
Your choice, mate. You can talk now

225
00:18:21.479 --> 00:18:24.539
or you can talk later.
Ain't that right, Persuader?

226
00:18:24.615 --> 00:18:27.914
Yeah, in a much higher voice!

227
00:18:27.985 --> 00:18:30.249
The Persuader's alive, Spike!

228
00:18:30.321 --> 00:18:32.312
You'll be singing like a tea kettle.

229
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:34.381
Good one, Persuader.

230
00:18:34.458 --> 00:18:37.359
I don't even know her!
I don't know anything!

231
00:18:37.428 --> 00:18:40.488
Careful, miss. You'll injure yourself.

232
00:18:41.499 --> 00:18:42.830
I know where it is!

233
00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:44.492
Come on, then. Spit it out!

234
00:18:44.568 --> 00:18:46.229
Don't you dare!

235
00:18:46.304 --> 00:18:49.740
Look at her bottom.
Is it me, or is it oddly shaped?

236
00:18:49.807 --> 00:18:52.332
You little snitch.

237
00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:55.174
The booty's in the booty.

238
00:18:55.503 --> 00:18:57.323
Hey!

239
00:19:04.255 --> 00:19:08.521
Thanks, mate! The boss is
gonna be so happy with us.

240
00:19:09.527 --> 00:19:11.688
You're toast.

241
00:19:15.866 --> 00:19:17.561
So you're from Up Top?

242
00:19:17.635 --> 00:19:20.798
I used to work in a laboratory Up Top.

243
00:19:20.871 --> 00:19:23.305
Yeah. Big shampoo job.

244
00:19:23.374 --> 00:19:26.537
I was dark grey when we started.

245
00:19:27.378 --> 00:19:29.710
Still, it cleared up me dandruff.

246
00:19:31.816 --> 00:19:35.809
<i>The World Cup has become the most
popular sporting event in the world.</i>

247
00:19:35.886 --> 00:19:38.719
Are you there, boss? We're back.

248
00:19:38.789 --> 00:19:41.383
I've got it, boss.

249
00:19:41.459 --> 00:19:44.360
The ruby. I found it.

250
00:19:44.428 --> 00:19:47.829
Technically, Spike,
it was Millicent that found it.

251
00:19:47.898 --> 00:19:50.230
Actually, the name's Roddy.

252
00:19:50.301 --> 00:19:53.767
In exchange for my assistance,
I was hoping you might...

253
00:19:56.207 --> 00:20:00.200
You might help me
out of the pickle I'm in.

254
00:20:03.347 --> 00:20:05.975
Hello, Rita.

255
00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:07.517
Hello, handsome.

256
00:20:07.585 --> 00:20:11.385
And who is this?
Is your new boyfriend a waiter?

257
00:20:11.455 --> 00:20:13.423
- Boyfriend?!
- Waiter?!

258
00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.593
The prize returns to me.

259
00:20:20.598 --> 00:20:23.533
Did you imagine
that I'd let you steal it from me?

260
00:20:23.601 --> 00:20:28.073
What?! That jewel belongs
to my father, and you know it!

261
00:20:28.105 --> 00:20:32.872
Your father? A good-for-nothing
scavenger, just like his daughter!

262
00:20:32.943 --> 00:20:35.343
Excuse me. Actually,

263
00:20:35.413 --> 00:20:37.404
I'm the one that found your ruby.

264
00:20:37.481 --> 00:20:40.678
So... you...

265
00:20:40.751 --> 00:20:44.251
Perhaps you'd repay the favor
and help me get home.

266
00:20:45.322 --> 00:20:46.789
Help me!

267
00:20:47.958 --> 00:20:49.448
Dispose of them.

268
00:20:49.527 --> 00:20:52.822
No, no, no, please!
I just want to get home to Kensington!

269
00:20:54.965 --> 00:20:57.900
Kensington? The Royal Borough?

270
00:20:57.968 --> 00:20:59.367
Up Top?

271
00:20:59.437 --> 00:21:02.133
Yes. Up Top.

272
00:21:02.973 --> 00:21:05.703
Huzzah! A man of quality!

273
00:21:05.776 --> 00:21:07.778
Finally, somebody gets it.

274
00:21:07.778 --> 00:21:07.903
Finally, somebody gets it.

275
00:21:07.978 --> 00:21:10.640
Come, let me show you
my private collection.

276
00:21:10.714 --> 00:21:13.581
I know you'll find it diverting.

277
00:21:17.688 --> 00:21:20.054
My shrine to beauty.

278
00:21:20.124 --> 00:21:24.788
Works of high art crafted
in tribute to our beloved Royal Family.

279
00:21:24.862 --> 00:21:27.660
Victoria's bust, wrought in porcelain.

280
00:21:27.731 --> 00:21:29.255
Classy!

281
00:21:29.333 --> 00:21:31.267
Quite lifelike, wouldn't you say?

282
00:21:31.836 --> 00:21:33.667
It's as if she were here.

283
00:21:34.338 --> 00:21:36.272
Smooth to the touch.

284
00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:37.364
Easy, tiger.

285
00:21:39.009 --> 00:21:42.103
But come! Let us restore the heart

286
00:21:42.179 --> 00:21:44.739
and highlight of my collection...

287
00:21:44.815 --> 00:21:49.809
...this ruby. Fallen from
the very brow of ancient kings.

288
00:21:49.887 --> 00:21:52.856
A true crown jewel!

289
00:21:56.861 --> 00:21:58.954
Well, what do you think?

290
00:21:59.029 --> 00:22:01.361
He's a madman! Run away!

291
00:22:01.432 --> 00:22:04.162
Pardon me. My fly's undone.

292
00:22:05.469 --> 00:22:08.700
Well, your ruby certainly is a biggie.

293
00:22:08.772 --> 00:22:10.763
Indeed.

294
00:22:10.841 --> 00:22:15.369
How did it ever find me,
here in the underbelly of the world?

295
00:22:15.446 --> 00:22:18.381
In this dark, low place.

296
00:22:19.717 --> 00:22:24.355
Yes. I'd love to see more of your
collection. It's very amusing, but l...

297
00:22:24.355 --> 00:22:24.377
Yes. I'd love to see more of your
collection. It's very amusing, but l...

298
00:22:24.455 --> 00:22:25.875
"Amusing"?

299
00:22:26.557 --> 00:22:28.388
Didn't you say I'd find it amusing?

300
00:22:28.459 --> 00:22:32.327
I said you'd find it diverting,
not amusing!

301
00:22:32.396 --> 00:22:36.196
When I said "amusing"
I really meant it in the sense

302
00:22:36.267 --> 00:22:39.896
of the ancient Greek muse,
the goddess of inspiration.

303
00:22:41.238 --> 00:22:42.569
Muse.

304
00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:54.415
Smashing.

305
00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:58.685
Heaven help me!

306
00:22:59.256 --> 00:23:01.383
Ice him! Ice them both!

307
00:23:02.259 --> 00:23:05.353
Let's see if there's
anything good in the fridge.

308
00:23:07.398 --> 00:23:10.026
Former enemies, one and all.

309
00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:14.230
A catalogue of thieves,
double-crossers and do-gooders.

310
00:23:16.907 --> 00:23:21.310
Prepare to meet your maker,
your ice maker.

311
00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:24.714
Makes me laugh every time, that one.

312
00:23:24.782 --> 00:23:26.079
Shut that door.

313
00:23:29.572 --> 00:23:32.373
Liquid Nitrogen! That will freeze us instantly!

314
00:23:32.389 --> 00:23:35.620
- There's a paper clip in my back pocket.
- See if you can get it.

315
00:23:35.693 --> 00:23:37.285
In the pocket, in the pocket!

316
00:23:42.533 --> 00:23:44.467
Blimey, it's cold.

317
00:23:44.535 --> 00:23:46.628
That's why I wore me mittens.

318
00:23:46.704 --> 00:23:50.470
Hit men don't wear mittens!
Take them off! You're embarrassing me.

319
00:23:50.541 --> 00:23:53.374
It's all right for you.
You've got little hands.

320
00:23:53.444 --> 00:23:55.571
- Got it!
- They don't get as cold.

321
00:23:55.646 --> 00:23:58.114
- I ain't got little hands!
- Yeah, you have.

322
00:23:58.182 --> 00:24:00.116
You got lady's hands.

323
00:24:00.117 --> 00:24:03.018
They might be small,
but they're lethal weapons.

324
00:24:03.087 --> 00:24:04.645
You got your mother's hands.

325
00:24:05.522 --> 00:24:08.150
Right. Put your hands together.

326
00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:12.681
You could have wiped your feet.

327
00:24:13.163 --> 00:24:14.926
Stop squirming!

328
00:24:20.237 --> 00:24:22.637
Goodbye, vermin.

329
00:24:27.611 --> 00:24:32.173
Now, let me see the latest addition
to my cubist collection.

330
00:24:35.185 --> 00:24:39.519
- What?! Impossible!
- Oi! Kermit!

331
00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:44.054
The prize returns to me!

332
00:24:44.128 --> 00:24:46.588
You big, fat, slimy airbag!

333
00:24:46.613 --> 00:24:49.163
After them!

334
00:24:51.368 --> 00:24:53.700
Why are you stopping?
Don't we have a plan?

335
00:24:53.771 --> 00:24:55.466
"We"? Who's "we"?

336
00:24:55.539 --> 00:24:57.200
You can't just leave me here!

337
00:24:57.274 --> 00:25:00.539
Faster, you idiots! They're escaping!

338
00:25:15.559 --> 00:25:18.221
No! Not the master cable!

339
00:25:18.295 --> 00:25:19.455
We have a plan?

340
00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:20.724
Put that back!

341
00:25:21.799 --> 00:25:24.131
Wait, wait!
That will never hold both of us.

342
00:25:24.201 --> 00:25:25.964
You're right. Toodle-oo.

343
00:25:26.036 --> 00:25:27.298
Wait!

344
00:25:27.538 --> 00:25:28.971
F-f-f-freeze!

345
00:25:31.661 --> 00:25:32.781
Oh, no!

346
00:25:34.411 --> 00:25:37.903
Don't break! There are things
I want to do, sights I want to see!

347
00:25:39.416 --> 00:25:41.658
- That wasn't on the list.
- Hey!

348
00:25:45.923 --> 00:25:47.413
Do something!

349
00:25:55.466 --> 00:25:58.663
Keep your legs straight
when you hit the water!

350
00:26:02.692 --> 00:26:05.252
I kept me legs straight, Spike.

351
00:26:08.612 --> 00:26:12.446
Good grief, that's high. Quite high.
Rather high. So very, very high.

352
00:26:18.956 --> 00:26:19.945
Cool.

353
00:26:20.624 --> 00:26:21.955
See you!

354
00:26:41.612 --> 00:26:43.035
If she can do it...

355
00:26:43.046 --> 00:26:45.535
Here goes.

356
00:26:53.652 --> 00:26:54.772
Oh!

357
00:27:01.498 --> 00:27:03.830
And gently down.

358
00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:09.939
- My ball.
- It's my ball, it's mine.

359
00:27:10.007 --> 00:27:12.498
Rita! Rita!

360
00:27:16.513 --> 00:27:19.004
Where is she? Rita!

361
00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:21.841
Target at twelve o'clock!

362
00:27:21.919 --> 00:27:23.409
Oh, come on!

363
00:27:27.357 --> 00:27:30.292
Careful, Whitey.
That's a banana skin.

364
00:27:34.998 --> 00:27:36.158
Rita!

365
00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:38.099
Over there!

366
00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:59.553
You look pretty ridiculous now,
Millicent.

367
00:28:04.261 --> 00:28:05.888
Keep your legs straight!

368
00:28:17.574 --> 00:28:21.408
What are you, some kind of rat
boomerang? Give me back my ruby!

369
00:28:21.478 --> 00:28:23.571
I haven't got your ruby!

370
00:28:27.251 --> 00:28:30.550
OK. Well, now I've got your ruby.

371
00:28:36.326 --> 00:28:37.691
Please be careful.

372
00:28:37.761 --> 00:28:40.821
That ruby means a lot to me.
It's priceless!

373
00:28:41.598 --> 00:28:42.929
Hold on.

374
00:28:43.433 --> 00:28:44.764
It's a fake.

375
00:28:44.835 --> 00:28:47.030
No, it's blooming not. It's real!

376
00:28:47.104 --> 00:28:49.004
No, no, no, look, it's just glass.

377
00:28:49.072 --> 00:28:50.505
- It's real!
- Fake.

378
00:28:50.574 --> 00:28:51.563
- Real!
- Fake.

379
00:28:51.642 --> 00:28:52.836
- Real!
- Fake.

380
00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:54.241
- Real!
- Fake.

381
00:28:54.311 --> 00:28:55.403
- Real!
- Fake.

382
00:28:55.479 --> 00:28:58.175
Look, look, look.
You can tell. Watch this.

383
00:29:02.452 --> 00:29:04.852
There, you see?
You can't break a real ruby.

384
00:29:06.957 --> 00:29:09.790
Right. I probably shouldn't
have done that.

385
00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:12.192
Look on the bright side.
I saved your neck.

386
00:29:12.262 --> 00:29:15.561
Once The Toad knows it's worthless,
he'll stop chasing you.

387
00:29:15.632 --> 00:29:18.635
Roddy St. James saves the day.

388
00:29:22.639 --> 00:29:24.129
Good grief!

389
00:29:24.207 --> 00:29:26.437
You try to do somebody
a favor, and they... Ow!

390
00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:31.573
A favor?! That ruby
was from Queen Elizabeth's crown!

391
00:29:31.648 --> 00:29:34.139
It fell down the drain
of Buckingham Palace!

392
00:29:34.217 --> 00:29:36.879
Maybe the Queen wears fake jewelry.

393
00:29:36.954 --> 00:29:38.922
Keep still!

394
00:29:38.989 --> 00:29:40.581
Can we just talk about this?

395
00:29:40.657 --> 00:29:45.424
Real or not, that ruby was
going to change my life!

396
00:29:45.662 --> 00:29:47.095
<i>Han Chin Chinese takeout.</i>

397
00:29:47.164 --> 00:29:49.564
A madwoman's attacking me with crayons!

398
00:29:49.633 --> 00:29:52.659
<i>- One chicken chow mein. With wonton?</i>
- No, crayons!

399
00:29:52.736 --> 00:29:55.170
<i>No wonton! You want rice?
Fried or white?</i>

400
00:29:55.238 --> 00:29:57.138
Fried. No, wait!

401
00:29:57.207 --> 00:29:58.799
<i>You want wonton or what?</i>

402
00:29:58.875 --> 00:30:00.502
Cancel that order.

403
00:30:01.345 --> 00:30:02.505
Rita?

404
00:30:02.579 --> 00:30:04.604
Just go away, please.

405
00:30:08.151 --> 00:30:09.482
I'm sorry.

406
00:30:10.754 --> 00:30:12.847
Sorry?

407
00:30:12.923 --> 00:30:16.086
Me and my dad
worked these drains for years.

408
00:30:16.159 --> 00:30:19.595
He broke every bone in his body
trying to get that ruby.

409
00:30:20.931 --> 00:30:23.695
It was going to be
the answer to all our prayers.

410
00:30:23.767 --> 00:30:26.759
Now it turns out it was a stupid fake.

411
00:30:30.607 --> 00:30:32.802
Maybe I can make it up to you.

412
00:30:32.876 --> 00:30:34.309
- Get stuffed.
- No, no, no.

413
00:30:34.378 --> 00:30:36.642
I mean it. Back at my place, we've got

414
00:30:36.713 --> 00:30:40.444
a jewelry box crammed
with rubies and diamonds. Real ones.

415
00:30:40.517 --> 00:30:44.112
All you have to do
is get me home to Kensington...

416
00:30:44.621 --> 00:30:48.182
...and I'll make you rich
beyond your wildest dreams.

417
00:30:50.794 --> 00:30:54.252
How do I know this ain't
just a load of old rubbish?

418
00:30:54.331 --> 00:30:57.767
Well, I suppose you'll
just have to trust me.

419
00:30:59.636 --> 00:31:01.866
I must be out of my mind.

420
00:31:01.938 --> 00:31:04.532
All right. You've got yourself a deal.

421
00:31:08.645 --> 00:31:09.942
Go on.

422
00:31:10.013 --> 00:31:11.310
You too.

423
00:31:12.662 --> 00:31:15.012
Your own hand.

424
00:31:25.495 --> 00:31:27.929
Where are those idiots?

425
00:31:27.998 --> 00:31:31.092
It's so hard to get
good help these days, my boys.

426
00:31:31.168 --> 00:31:34.569
That's right. Come on out, my lovelies.

427
00:31:34.638 --> 00:31:37.334
Cheer your old dad up.

428
00:31:37.407 --> 00:31:40.501
Poor Daddy, surrounded by filthy rats

429
00:31:40.577 --> 00:31:44.445
in this joyless, sunless void!

430
00:31:44.514 --> 00:31:46.778
But don't worry, little men.

431
00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:50.183
Daddy will get rid of them all! He will.

432
00:31:50.253 --> 00:31:53.188
They'll all be deady-weady.

433
00:31:57.861 --> 00:31:59.351
Did you find it?

434
00:32:00.597 --> 00:32:02.121
Did you find it?

435
00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:06.192
Well, we got most of it, boss.

436
00:32:07.003 --> 00:32:10.939
Forget the ruby!
It's the master cable that I want.

437
00:32:11.007 --> 00:32:14.469
- The one that grubby creature Rita took.
- Oh!

438
00:32:14.544 --> 00:32:16.808
Without it, my plan is ruined!

439
00:32:17.948 --> 00:32:22.044
OK, chief.
Forget the ruby. Ruby's gone.

440
00:32:22.119 --> 00:32:26.419
See? See? Moving on.
We are now your cable guys.

441
00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:28.583
Focused. Cable-centric, boss.

442
00:32:29.392 --> 00:32:32.759
You need to be back in time
for the World Cup Final.

443
00:32:32.829 --> 00:32:35.161
Great! Are we watching
the game together?

444
00:32:36.533 --> 00:32:38.631
Just get the cable!

445
00:32:38.719 --> 00:32:40.710
Keep your legs straight!

446
00:32:41.438 --> 00:32:44.236
Are you sure we should be
stopping with goons after us?

447
00:32:44.307 --> 00:32:46.901
We aren't gonna get far
without a map, are we?

448
00:32:48.912 --> 00:32:50.436
Is that a house?

449
00:32:50.514 --> 00:32:54.177
Yes, and it's very dangerous. So...

450
00:32:54.251 --> 00:32:55.980
- Ah!
- ...why don't you wait here.

451
00:32:56.052 --> 00:32:58.179
Waiting here. Excellent idea.

452
00:32:58.255 --> 00:33:00.485
Watch out for the piranha.

453
00:33:01.691 --> 00:33:03.022
Rita!

454
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.025
Here you go, Annie. You, Shamus.

455
00:33:12.102 --> 00:33:14.764
Mimi, get your finger out of your nose.
Fergus.

456
00:33:14.838 --> 00:33:17.807
- Jojo, no biting.
- That is wild good!

457
00:33:18.074 --> 00:33:19.939
Rita!

458
00:33:23.678 --> 00:33:25.153
- Ta-da!
- Rita's back!

459
00:33:25.182 --> 00:33:27.616
- Rita!
- Mum! Oh, Mum.

460
00:33:27.684 --> 00:33:29.276
Thank goodness you're safe.

461
00:33:33.323 --> 00:33:35.450
Rita!

462
00:33:35.525 --> 00:33:36.514
Hello, Dad.

463
00:33:36.593 --> 00:33:38.518
Give us a hug, girl!

464
00:33:45.068 --> 00:33:47.662
Mom, there's a peeping Tom outside!

465
00:33:47.737 --> 00:33:51.366
Tom?! Ohh, it's Tom Jones!

466
00:33:51.441 --> 00:33:53.671
Mother, it's not Tom Jones.

467
00:33:53.743 --> 00:33:56.473
That's just my passenger.

468
00:33:56.546 --> 00:34:00.346
- He's very good-looking.
- He is not coming in.

469
00:34:01.351 --> 00:34:03.182
Soup's on!

470
00:34:04.621 --> 00:34:06.521
It's lovely. Thanks, Mum.

471
00:34:13.797 --> 00:34:16.197
So how long have you been
Rita's boyfriend?

472
00:34:16.266 --> 00:34:18.200
He's not my boyfriend.

473
00:34:19.336 --> 00:34:21.702
Will you make an honest woman
of my daughter?

474
00:34:21.771 --> 00:34:23.068
Dad!

475
00:34:23.139 --> 00:34:26.131
We were thinking of a spring wedding,
right, cream puff?

476
00:34:26.209 --> 00:34:29.007
Look, I want all of you to know he's...

477
00:34:29.079 --> 00:34:30.876
Tom Jones!

478
00:34:31.548 --> 00:34:34.449
So your name is "Roddy,"
is that right?

479
00:34:34.517 --> 00:34:36.417
Yes, that's right. Roddy St. James.

480
00:34:36.486 --> 00:34:38.044
What a beautiful name.

481
00:34:38.121 --> 00:34:40.351
- Hi, Roddy.
- Who might you be, little chap?

482
00:34:40.423 --> 00:34:42.891
- They call me Shocky.
- Why do they call you that?

483
00:34:42.959 --> 00:34:45.553
- Shocky!
- Yes! Got it.

484
00:34:45.629 --> 00:34:49.258
Rita, where are you taking
this handsome young man?

485
00:34:50.166 --> 00:34:52.396
That's why I need your maps, Dad.

486
00:34:52.469 --> 00:34:55.563
Because he's from... Up Top.

487
00:34:59.042 --> 00:35:02.375
Kitchen. Now.

488
00:35:02.445 --> 00:35:05.243
Sing us a song, Tom!

489
00:35:06.349 --> 00:35:09.910
- I'm not saying it isn't risky.
- But it's impossible, Rita.

490
00:35:09.986 --> 00:35:12.921
No one's ever got past
the rapids at Hyde Park.

491
00:35:12.989 --> 00:35:15.856
Dad, Dad! He's gonna pay us.

492
00:35:15.925 --> 00:35:19.759
For the last time,
we don't need the money!

493
00:35:22.866 --> 00:35:24.891
A new stove might be nice.

494
00:35:25.468 --> 00:35:30.565
- Talkin' about the little lady
- Go, Tom! Go!

495
00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:32.437
- Sing to my heart!
- She's a lady

496
00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:36.101
Talkin' about that old lady

497
00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:39.680
And the lady wears big undies

498
00:35:39.749 --> 00:35:41.273
Huge undies.

499
00:35:42.118 --> 00:35:43.517
Psst! Rita!

500
00:35:43.586 --> 00:35:45.747
It's OK. It's me, Liam.

501
00:35:45.822 --> 00:35:47.187
Quick, in the kitchen.

502
00:35:47.257 --> 00:35:48.815
Look at those moves!

503
00:35:48.892 --> 00:35:50.985
I love you, Tom!

504
00:35:51.061 --> 00:35:53.029
This bloke isn't who he says he is.

505
00:35:53.096 --> 00:35:56.930
His real name is Millicent Bystander,
an international jewel thief.

506
00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.934
A mastermind, a super-criminal.

507
00:35:59.002 --> 00:36:01.800
Looks like he crossed The Toad
and got away with it.

508
00:36:01.871 --> 00:36:04.362
But I'm a thinker. I've got a plan.

509
00:36:06.176 --> 00:36:08.576
More! More!

510
00:36:09.646 --> 00:36:12.308
- That was brilliant!
- Oh, it was nothing.

511
00:36:12.382 --> 00:36:14.907
- So you're from Up Top?
- Yes.

512
00:36:14.984 --> 00:36:17.214
- I've met one of your lot before.
- Really?

513
00:36:17.287 --> 00:36:19.118
Used to be some old lady's pet.

514
00:36:19.189 --> 00:36:20.588
That's nice.

515
00:36:20.657 --> 00:36:24.491
Terribly lonely for him, though.
He had no one to talk to.

516
00:36:24.561 --> 00:36:26.495
No one to cuddle with!

517
00:36:26.563 --> 00:36:28.087
No one to shocky.

518
00:36:28.164 --> 00:36:30.655
That's no life, is it?

519
00:36:32.602 --> 00:36:34.934
I'd better get these dishes started.

520
00:36:35.772 --> 00:36:38.070
Please, permit me.

521
00:36:38.141 --> 00:36:40.632
Oh, you're such a gentleman!

522
00:36:41.077 --> 00:36:45.036
Great! So I hand Roddy
over to The Toad

523
00:36:45.115 --> 00:36:47.083
and claim the reward.

524
00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:50.642
Then we're all sitting pretty
for the rest of our lives. Is that it?

525
00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:52.551
The Toad will pay a fortune for him.

526
00:36:52.622 --> 00:36:55.318
He's a bad one anyway,
so that's all right, isn't it?

527
00:36:55.658 --> 00:36:59.890
You cheeky little monkey. I won't have
no son of mine acting the rat.

528
00:36:59.963 --> 00:37:02.397
We Malones never go back on our word.

529
00:37:02.465 --> 00:37:04.899
- He's gonna steal your boat.
- He won't.

530
00:37:04.968 --> 00:37:07.493
- He's stealing your boat.
- He isn't stealing...

531
00:37:07.570 --> 00:37:09.902
- He stole your boat.
- What?

532
00:37:09.973 --> 00:37:12.535
He's like Robin Hood in reverse.

533
00:37:14.511 --> 00:37:16.470
Oi! I thought we had a deal!

534
00:37:17.269 --> 00:37:18.861
So did l!

535
00:37:22.352 --> 00:37:26.015
This is an emergency!
Get out of the way! Emergency!

536
00:37:26.089 --> 00:37:30.355
Keep clear! I'm coming, Mr. Jones,
I'm coming! Marry me, Mr. Jones!

537
00:37:30.427 --> 00:37:32.019
Roddy!

538
00:37:36.966 --> 00:37:37.767
That double-crossing little schemer.
I don't need her.

539
00:37:37.767 --> 00:37:39.997
That double-crossing little schemer.
I don't need her.

540
00:37:40.069 --> 00:37:42.697
I mean, anyone can get out
and sail. Look at me!

541
00:37:44.507 --> 00:37:47.101
All right, Sid,
you're in for a big surprise.

542
00:37:47.177 --> 00:37:48.701
Look out!

543
00:37:49.245 --> 00:37:50.872
Sorry!

544
00:37:53.349 --> 00:37:55.340
Sid's Tattoo and Hot Dog Parlor.

545
00:37:55.418 --> 00:37:58.148
<i>It's Roddy. Remember me?</i>

546
00:37:58.221 --> 00:38:00.587
<i>- The butler?</i>
- Roddy!

547
00:38:00.657 --> 00:38:04.115
Listen, you! If you're still there when I get back...

548
00:38:04.194 --> 00:38:07.789
Back? Back?
How will you do that then, Roddy?

549
00:38:08.565 --> 00:38:10.760
- What was that?
<i>- Gotta go, Rodders.</i>

550
00:38:10.834 --> 00:38:12.893
If I find one thing out of place...

551
00:38:34.424 --> 00:38:36.984
Here's a little song I wrote

552
00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:40.188
You might want to sing it note for note

553
00:38:40.263 --> 00:38:43.426
Don't worry

554
00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:45.024
Be happy

555
00:38:45.235 --> 00:38:48.068
Don't worry, be happy now

556
00:38:53.009 --> 00:38:55.102
Where are they hiding?

557
00:38:55.512 --> 00:38:58.242
Think. Think.

558
00:38:58.314 --> 00:39:02.444
To find a rat,
you got to think like a rat.

559
00:39:04.354 --> 00:39:05.685
Hey, guys.

560
00:39:05.755 --> 00:39:10.454
I've had a tip-off.
They're heading west to Kensington.

561
00:39:11.628 --> 00:39:13.152
Bingo!

562
00:39:13.229 --> 00:39:14.753
Scrabble!

563
00:39:14.831 --> 00:39:17.459
Enough games. To the ratmobiles!

564
00:39:19.202 --> 00:39:21.830
OK, OK. We can fix it.

565
00:39:21.905 --> 00:39:24.135
Yes, we can. Obviously...

566
00:39:25.475 --> 00:39:29.138
Fairly major burn to the hand.
Smell of burning flesh.

567
00:39:29.212 --> 00:39:30.804
Maybe I should just...

568
00:39:39.155 --> 00:39:40.417
That really hurt.

569
00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:45.587
Just start, you worthless old pile
of rubbish! You useless, unreliable...

570
00:39:45.662 --> 00:39:50.599
Untrustworthy, double-crossing,
two-faced, conniving little toe-rag!

571
00:39:55.838 --> 00:39:59.934
So I'm the double-crosser?
Oh, yes, that's rich!

572
00:40:00.009 --> 00:40:01.499
I overheard everything.

573
00:40:01.578 --> 00:40:05.036
Yes, you and your family
were gonna sell me to The Toad!

574
00:40:05.114 --> 00:40:06.945
What?

575
00:40:07.016 --> 00:40:10.918
You dipstick! That was
my stupid little brother's plan.

576
00:40:10.987 --> 00:40:12.648
And no one listens to him.

577
00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:15.958
Must have missed that part.

578
00:40:16.025 --> 00:40:21.053
How could you think I'd sell you out?
When I make a deal, I make a deal.

579
00:40:21.864 --> 00:40:23.195
Your hair's on fire.

580
00:40:23.266 --> 00:40:26.181
What?

581
00:40:28.037 --> 00:40:29.470
Rita, look...

582
00:40:29.539 --> 00:40:34.602
...I'm sorry. I was wrong.
I think we should just put it behind us.

583
00:40:36.079 --> 00:40:39.207
OK. I suppose I can put it behind me.

584
00:40:39.882 --> 00:40:43.181
This is such an overreaction!

585
00:40:43.252 --> 00:40:47.154
Rita, you can't just
leave me here on a...

586
00:40:47.223 --> 00:40:50.454
On a duck! Up the creek without a...

587
00:40:52.061 --> 00:40:55.394
You're getting everything you deserve.
Sneaking around,

588
00:40:55.465 --> 00:40:57.899
eavesdropping
on people's conversations.

589
00:40:57.967 --> 00:41:00.162
I was not sneaking around.

590
00:41:00.236 --> 00:41:02.261
Right.

591
00:41:02.338 --> 00:41:06.832
I say, you can't really intend
to just strand me like this.

592
00:41:06.909 --> 00:41:08.900
You're not that heartless.

593
00:41:09.579 --> 00:41:11.877
OK, maybe you are.

594
00:41:11.948 --> 00:41:15.076
If you're trying to teach me a lesson,
consider it taught!

595
00:41:15.151 --> 00:41:17.210
I'm on a duck, begging!

596
00:41:30.099 --> 00:41:31.794
Ice cold Rita

597
00:41:31.868 --> 00:41:34.632
Never did I meet a

598
00:41:34.704 --> 00:41:38.606
Girl who's half so cruel
I offered her a jewel

599
00:41:38.675 --> 00:41:41.041
But she left me stuck
Stranded on a duck

600
00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:44.876
What a shoddy thing to do to Roddy
Me

601
00:41:44.947 --> 00:41:47.609
That's Roddy St. James of Kensington

602
00:41:47.684 --> 00:41:50.175
Poor, poor Roddy

603
00:41:50.253 --> 00:41:52.778
Flushed down his own potty

604
00:41:52.855 --> 00:41:56.450
Rita, can't you find it in your heart

605
00:41:56.526 --> 00:41:59.552
To help him?

606
00:41:59.629 --> 00:42:01.790
How mean can one rat be?

607
00:42:01.864 --> 00:42:04.025
Ice cold Rita

608
00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:09.128
Won't you be sweeter to me?

609
00:42:13.876 --> 00:42:15.571
Am I forgiven?

610
00:42:15.645 --> 00:42:18.136
No. I was just afraid
you'd sing another verse.

611
00:42:18.214 --> 00:42:21.047
Rita, I wasn't eavesdropping,
I swear to you.

612
00:42:21.117 --> 00:42:22.982
Oh, really?

613
00:42:25.054 --> 00:42:27.352
What were you doing, then, Roddy?

614
00:42:27.423 --> 00:42:32.520
I was actually just watching you
with your family...

615
00:42:32.595 --> 00:42:34.495
...and...

616
00:42:34.564 --> 00:42:36.589
...thinking how lucky you were.

617
00:42:44.557 --> 00:42:47.048
Lucky? Stuck with you?

618
00:42:49.312 --> 00:42:50.540
So our deal's still on?

619
00:42:50.613 --> 00:42:52.478
Sure it is.

620
00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:00.716
Look, I really want to
help out around here.

621
00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:04.089
Just give me a job.
Anything... engineer, navigator.

622
00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:06.151
I could drive for a bit if you like.

623
00:43:08.931 --> 00:43:10.728
Pick on someone your own size!

624
00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:12.859
- You heard the captain.
- Get lost!

625
00:43:12.935 --> 00:43:14.897
There's no room
for passengers on this boat.

626
00:43:16.839 --> 00:43:19.706
Let go, you sticky little...

627
00:43:23.045 --> 00:43:24.876
I'm the captain, and I say go left.

628
00:43:24.947 --> 00:43:27.575
Would that be port
or starboard, Spike?

629
00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:28.947
There they are!

630
00:43:29.018 --> 00:43:29.652
Go get them, lads!

631
00:43:29.652 --> 00:43:31.010
Go get them, lads!

632
00:43:39.228 --> 00:43:40.388
Rita!

633
00:43:43.633 --> 00:43:46.568
Wait for it, wait for it... Now!

634
00:43:49.272 --> 00:43:51.832
Have another go if you think
you're fast enough!

635
00:43:55.244 --> 00:43:56.939
Hold on, Roddy!

636
00:43:57.013 --> 00:43:59.413
Get that cable, lads!

637
00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:10.324
You may now kiss the bride.

638
00:44:14.297 --> 00:44:15.889
Congratulations, by the way!

639
00:44:20.102 --> 00:44:21.296
Rita!

640
00:44:26.442 --> 00:44:28.774
Rita! Can we go a little faster, please?

641
00:44:28.845 --> 00:44:30.836
We don't have to!

642
00:44:32.415 --> 00:44:35.009
Go, go, purple custard!

643
00:44:49.098 --> 00:44:51.032
End of the line, Millicent.

644
00:44:52.986 --> 00:44:54.806
Oh, yeah!

645
00:44:56.939 --> 00:44:59.339
- Rita, try and go right!
- What?

646
00:44:59.408 --> 00:45:00.568
Just trust me!

647
00:45:00.643 --> 00:45:02.873
I hope you know what you're doing!

648
00:45:04.537 --> 00:45:06.061
Now head for the rope!

649
00:45:06.415 --> 00:45:07.677
OK.

650
00:45:09.242 --> 00:45:10.362
Whoa!

651
00:45:17.667 --> 00:45:19.467
Oh, no.

652
00:45:21.664 --> 00:45:23.393
Well done, Roddy!

653
00:45:23.466 --> 00:45:25.832
We did it! We did it!

654
00:45:26.769 --> 00:45:28.031
We didn't do it.

655
00:45:30.273 --> 00:45:32.070
Can you get me back on the boat?

656
00:45:36.846 --> 00:45:39.007
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

657
00:45:39.849 --> 00:45:44.286
Are you sure about this, Spike? These
things are supposed to be dangerous.

658
00:45:44.353 --> 00:45:46.548
Danger is my middle name.

659
00:45:46.622 --> 00:45:48.715
I thought it was Leslie.

660
00:45:57.199 --> 00:45:59.531
Just thought I'd drop in.

661
00:45:59.602 --> 00:46:01.035
Rita, do something quick!

662
00:46:02.392 --> 00:46:03.723
Hang on tight!

663
00:46:08.917 --> 00:46:12.069
Whoa!

664
00:46:14.617 --> 00:46:15.777
Uh-oh.

665
00:46:16.986 --> 00:46:19.318
Any last requests?

666
00:46:19.388 --> 00:46:23.415
Yes. Could you fly quite suddenly
off the boat, screaming like a girl?

667
00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:40.031
Oh, dear.

668
00:46:45.014 --> 00:46:45.147
Yes!

669
00:46:45.147 --> 00:46:46.671
Yes!

670
00:46:55.591 --> 00:46:59.152
Look out!

671
00:47:03.933 --> 00:47:05.628
You darn foreigners!

672
00:47:11.402 --> 00:47:14.064
Do you think the boss will be annoyed with us?

673
00:47:15.177 --> 00:47:18.169
You incompetent cheese-eaters!

674
00:47:18.247 --> 00:47:20.272
You let them escape?

675
00:47:23.052 --> 00:47:26.818
It's obvious I should never have sent
rodents to do an amphibian's job.

676
00:47:26.889 --> 00:47:28.049
Where is he?

677
00:47:28.124 --> 00:47:30.115
Why is he always late?

678
00:47:33.596 --> 00:47:36.963
En garde! Droit! Parry! Thrust!

679
00:47:38.134 --> 00:47:39.424
Le Frog?

680
00:47:46.142 --> 00:47:47.700
Bonjour.

681
00:47:47.777 --> 00:47:49.244
You're late, Le Frog.

682
00:47:49.311 --> 00:47:54.010
Fashionably late, my annoying
English cousin. I know no other way.

683
00:47:54.083 --> 00:47:59.316
Now, listen. Rita and her new accomplice
have stolen something irreplaceable.

684
00:47:59.388 --> 00:48:01.882
It's all right, boss!
We've got another one!

685
00:48:03.926 --> 00:48:07.528
A master cable
of unique design and purpose.

686
00:48:07.545 --> 00:48:09.137
I want it back.

687
00:48:09.570 --> 00:48:12.170
Don't worry. I'll get it back for you.

688
00:48:12.334 --> 00:48:15.701
Once it is returned,
my plan will be complete.

689
00:48:15.771 --> 00:48:20.674
To wash away, once and for all,
the curse, the scourge of...

690
00:48:23.012 --> 00:48:24.343
...rats.

691
00:48:26.182 --> 00:48:28.548
Forgive me, my warty English cousin,

692
00:48:28.617 --> 00:48:33.145
but this bizarre obsession
with the rats, it is not good for you.

693
00:48:33.222 --> 00:48:37.682
You are becoming
what we French call le fruitcake.

694
00:48:38.861 --> 00:48:43.525
Perhaps you forget that it was a rat
who cast me from paradise!

695
00:48:43.599 --> 00:48:47.194
Oh, please. Not the scrapbook again!

696
00:48:47.269 --> 00:48:49.032
My memoirs.

697
00:48:50.372 --> 00:48:54.365
Volume one details the dire
and tragic story of my youth.

698
00:48:54.443 --> 00:48:56.274
Oh, mon Dieu!

699
00:48:58.013 --> 00:49:01.278
Of all the pets in Buckingham Palace,

700
00:49:01.350 --> 00:49:04.877
young Prince Charles
fancied me the best.

701
00:49:04.954 --> 00:49:09.721
We would frolic
day after sunny day in royal abandon,

702
00:49:09.792 --> 00:49:14.388
sharing that sweet and magical bond
between boy and toad.

703
00:49:14.463 --> 00:49:16.624
You're gonna make me throw up.

704
00:49:16.699 --> 00:49:19.566
We were inseparable until...

705
00:49:19.635 --> 00:49:21.569
...it arrived.

706
00:49:21.637 --> 00:49:24.231
That rat!

707
00:49:24.306 --> 00:49:27.139
While the poor boy's head was turned,

708
00:49:27.209 --> 00:49:32.237
I was cruelly plunged
into a whirlpool of despair.

709
00:49:33.582 --> 00:49:37.916
I know, I know. You were flushed
away down the loo, right?

710
00:49:39.555 --> 00:49:41.147
Oi.

711
00:49:41.223 --> 00:49:44.590
Boo-hoo-hoo. It is so dark,

712
00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:48.255
so cold, so terrible!

713
00:49:48.330 --> 00:49:50.423
You find my pain funny?

714
00:49:50.499 --> 00:49:53.332
I find everyone's pain funny but my own.

715
00:49:53.402 --> 00:49:55.097
I'm French.

716
00:49:55.604 --> 00:49:57.572
Just get the cable!

717
00:49:58.274 --> 00:49:59.605
Henchfrogs!

718
00:50:00.776 --> 00:50:04.439
We have a mission.
Let nothing stand in our way.

719
00:50:04.513 --> 00:50:07.107
We leave immediately.

720
00:50:08.284 --> 00:50:09.945
What about dinner?

721
00:50:13.455 --> 00:50:15.923
We leave... in five hours.

722
00:50:19.795 --> 00:50:24.789
Love, love, love, love

723
00:50:29.138 --> 00:50:30.799
This is quite tasty.

724
00:50:30.873 --> 00:50:32.033
Thanks.

725
00:50:32.107 --> 00:50:36.373
Not too bad, considering I only had
an apple, six raisins and a box of rice.

726
00:50:36.445 --> 00:50:38.072
Rice?

727
00:50:39.515 --> 00:50:42.313
What's that urge from deep inside?

728
00:50:42.384 --> 00:50:45.376
The need to hurl won't be denied

729
00:50:45.454 --> 00:50:49.823
That isn't rice
That's maggots you're eating

730
00:50:49.892 --> 00:50:53.328
Larva, larva, larva...

731
00:50:54.496 --> 00:50:58.489
That explains why it all ran to one side
when I put the salt in.

732
00:50:59.235 --> 00:51:00.497
You know...

733
00:51:01.403 --> 00:51:03.735
...I think we did pretty well today.

734
00:51:04.506 --> 00:51:09.205
I suppose maybe I misjudged you a bit.
I mean, you're not...

735
00:51:09.278 --> 00:51:11.678
Do I hear an actual compliment coming?

736
00:51:12.514 --> 00:51:15.347
- Never mind.
- No, no, no, say it.

737
00:51:16.518 --> 00:51:21.182
You're not the useless, whiny, stuck-up,
pompous, big girl's blouse I thought.

738
00:51:21.257 --> 00:51:23.191
There. Was that so hard?

739
00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:27.796
We better get some rest
if we're gonna get you home tomorrow.

740
00:51:27.863 --> 00:51:29.353
Catch.

741
00:51:32.919 --> 00:51:35.842
Tell me about yourself, Roddy.

742
00:51:36.705 --> 00:51:39.367
Well, there's not much to tell.

743
00:51:39.708 --> 00:51:44.111
You know all about me, warts and all.
I don't even know what you do.

744
00:51:44.179 --> 00:51:45.806
I'm...

745
00:51:45.881 --> 00:51:47.348
I'm in a boy band.

746
00:51:48.117 --> 00:51:50.381
Yeah. Yeah, I'm the posh one.

747
00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:52.985
I'm serious.

748
00:51:53.055 --> 00:51:57.014
Tell me about your life Up Top.
Friends, family.

749
00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:00.926
You do have a family, don't you?

750
00:52:00.996 --> 00:52:05.899
Of course I do. Brothers, sisters,
cousins. We're quite a clan.

751
00:52:05.968 --> 00:52:07.936
You wouldn't believe the fun we have.

752
00:52:08.003 --> 00:52:11.905
Hanging out at the movies,
playing golf, going skiing.

753
00:52:11.974 --> 00:52:14.465
It's just so great!

754
00:52:15.311 --> 00:52:17.779
No wonder you want to get home.

755
00:52:18.814 --> 00:52:20.111
Yeah.

756
00:52:20.182 --> 00:52:24.414
Well, I guess tomorrow
we'll both get what we want.

757
00:52:26.488 --> 00:52:27.887
Good night.

758
00:52:27.956 --> 00:52:29.423
Good night, Roddy.

759
00:52:32.261 --> 00:52:33.592
Good night.

760
00:52:34.596 --> 00:52:36.086
Good night.

761
00:52:36.932 --> 00:52:38.024
Good night.

762
00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:39.465
Good night.

763
00:52:39.535 --> 00:52:41.002
Good night.

764
00:52:41.070 --> 00:52:43.538
Good night, Roddy.

765
00:52:43.605 --> 00:52:45.766
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

766
00:53:06.615 --> 00:53:09.840
Wakey-wakey!

767
00:53:09.861 --> 00:53:11.556
Getting close to Kensington.

768
00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:14.963
Tie down anything loose.
It'll be a bumpy ride.

769
00:53:15.033 --> 00:53:16.967
Aye, aye, captain.

770
00:53:28.814 --> 00:53:31.214
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

771
00:53:31.950 --> 00:53:33.281
- Bonjour!
- Bonjour!

772
00:53:33.352 --> 00:53:34.785
- Bonjour!
- Bonjour!

773
00:53:34.853 --> 00:53:36.184
Bonjour!

774
00:53:36.255 --> 00:53:38.314
Who invited you onboard?

775
00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:40.756
Hop it. Hop it!

776
00:53:41.660 --> 00:53:45.255
The English little girly,
she's so aggressive.

777
00:53:46.231 --> 00:53:47.562
Le Frog.

778
00:53:48.433 --> 00:53:51.334
I like a woman with a little fire.

779
00:53:54.006 --> 00:53:58.102
You're going to pay for that,
my little chocolate croissant!

780
00:53:58.176 --> 00:54:02.340
But first,
a word from our sponsor. Marcel?

781
00:54:16.591 --> 00:54:17.711
<i>Ahh.</i>

782
00:54:18.263 --> 00:54:19.628
I should have known.

783
00:54:19.698 --> 00:54:23.190
<i>Well done, Le Frog! I salute you, sir.</i>

784
00:54:24.036 --> 00:54:26.869
<i>Now then, Rita, hand it over.</i>

785
00:54:26.938 --> 00:54:28.200
Hand what over?

786
00:54:29.708 --> 00:54:32.871
<i>This dance of deception must end.</i>

787
00:54:32.944 --> 00:54:35.879
<i>Return what you have stolen from me.</i>

788
00:54:35.947 --> 00:54:37.812
<i>Enough dancing!</i>

789
00:54:37.883 --> 00:54:40.977
I don't have it anymore.
It was a fake anyway.

790
00:54:41.053 --> 00:54:42.213
<i>What?</i>

791
00:54:42.888 --> 00:54:44.379
<i>Oh, the ruby.</i>

792
00:54:49.828 --> 00:54:53.389
He's cuckoo, but family.

793
00:54:53.465 --> 00:54:55.228
<i>Oh, this is rich.</i>

794
00:54:55.300 --> 00:54:58.064
<i>The ruby was a pretty thing.</i>

795
00:55:00.305 --> 00:55:01.829
<i>Stop that.</i>

796
00:55:01.907 --> 00:55:05.741
<i>But nothing when compared
to the master cable.</i>

797
00:55:05.811 --> 00:55:08.006
The master what?

798
00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:09.274
<i>The cab...</i>

799
00:55:09.348 --> 00:55:10.906
<i>Turn.</i>

800
00:55:12.751 --> 00:55:17.654
<i>The cable!
The one you're now wearing as a belt.</i>

801
00:55:17.723 --> 00:55:19.850
- If that's all he wants...
- Hang on.

802
00:55:19.925 --> 00:55:21.984
What do you want it for anyway?

803
00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:25.729
<i>Oh, you'll see, come
the World Cup Final this afternoon.</i>

804
00:55:28.433 --> 00:55:29.764
The World Cup Final?

805
00:55:30.010 --> 00:55:32.604
OK, OK, cousin, take a breath. Leave it to me.

806
00:55:32.838 --> 00:55:36.137
We'll get your cable, kill the rodents,
then me and my team

807
00:55:36.208 --> 00:55:38.267
can settle down to a decent breakfast.

808
00:55:38.460 --> 00:55:41.435
OK, men, to action!

809
00:55:41.513 --> 00:55:43.674
We surrender!

810
00:55:43.749 --> 00:55:47.742
- No, not that one, you idiots! The kung fu thing!
- Oh!

811
00:55:52.257 --> 00:55:53.747
I've got a plan.

812
00:55:57.295 --> 00:55:58.319
Go for it.

813
00:55:58.660 --> 00:56:00.798
Fly at twelve o'clock!

814
00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:02.589
Oh, bother.

815
00:56:06.972 --> 00:56:08.898
<i>Fools! Grab them!</i>

816
00:56:13.044 --> 00:56:16.207
<i>Le Frog! No! Get that cable!</i>

817
00:56:16.281 --> 00:56:17.543
Mon Dieu!

818
00:56:17.616 --> 00:56:20.107
<i>You rats, this is not over yet!</i>

819
00:56:22.287 --> 00:56:24.248
Roddy! The rapids!

820
00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:27.299
Oh, no!

821
00:56:37.369 --> 00:56:38.529
En garde!

822
00:56:39.384 --> 00:56:40.484
Ha!

823
00:56:40.559 --> 00:56:42.959
Rita? We're going over!

824
00:56:43.508 --> 00:56:45.135
Do something!

825
00:56:55.175 --> 00:56:57.975
No, no, no!

826
00:57:07.165 --> 00:57:08.359
Gotcha!

827
00:57:14.506 --> 00:57:16.701
Au revoir, mon ch駻i!

828
00:57:16.775 --> 00:57:19.800
Take your flippers off me!

829
00:57:22.414 --> 00:57:24.279
I have triumphed!

830
00:57:24.349 --> 00:57:29.013
You stupid English, with your
Yorkshire puddings and chips and fish,

831
00:57:29.087 --> 00:57:33.080
you thought you could
defeat Le Frog? Un...

832
00:57:36.661 --> 00:57:37.653
...deux...

833
00:57:40.031 --> 00:57:41.225
...trois!

834
00:57:45.871 --> 00:57:47.862
Nibble for your life!

835
00:57:56.214 --> 00:57:57.943
My belt, I think.

836
00:57:58.016 --> 00:58:01.581
You rodents!

837
00:58:03.221 --> 00:58:05.382
Goodbye, Jammy, me old mate.

838
00:58:13.906 --> 00:58:16.006
Whee!

839
00:58:19.504 --> 00:58:21.495
We're OK, we're OK, we're OK, we're OK.

840
00:58:21.573 --> 00:58:23.734
Try opening your eyes!

841
00:58:27.579 --> 00:58:29.137
We're over Kensington!

842
00:58:29.214 --> 00:58:34.151
Yeah, only a terrifying 900-foot drop
between you and a nice comfortable bed.

843
00:58:34.219 --> 00:58:35.811
Where's your house then?

844
00:58:35.887 --> 00:58:37.752
Right, now. Let me see...

845
00:58:38.256 --> 00:58:41.589
Inverness Gardens, Vicarage Gate,
Kensington High Street.

846
00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:43.127
Try and go left.

847
00:58:43.194 --> 00:58:45.253
That's it. Now go right.

848
00:58:46.131 --> 00:58:47.792
This is gonna be tricky.

849
00:58:47.866 --> 00:58:50.426
Yeah, and everything else
has been a piece of cake.

850
00:58:50.502 --> 00:58:52.436
All right, here we go.

851
00:58:53.605 --> 00:58:57.268
Forty-five, 47, 49...

852
00:58:57.576 --> 00:58:58.941
...now!

853
00:59:08.620 --> 00:59:11.612
Well, I've had softer landings.

854
00:59:17.195 --> 00:59:18.492
We did it.

855
00:59:18.997 --> 00:59:20.726
I'm home.

856
00:59:20.799 --> 00:59:24.462
The crew of the Jammy Dodger survives!

857
00:59:24.536 --> 00:59:26.128
Yep.

858
00:59:26.972 --> 00:59:28.132
Rita?

859
00:59:30.642 --> 00:59:34.669
Oh, of course.
I'm such an idiot. The Dodger.

860
00:59:34.746 --> 00:59:36.543
Wasn't your fault, Rod.

861
00:59:37.315 --> 00:59:39.442
Quite an adventure, though, wasn't it?

862
00:59:39.517 --> 00:59:42.145
Rita, I am so sorry.

863
00:59:43.755 --> 00:59:46.986
But I think I might be able
to cheer you up.

864
00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:53.156
Ta-da! As promised,
the Kensington jewels.

865
00:59:53.999 --> 00:59:56.297
A genuine star-cut ruby.

866
00:59:56.368 --> 00:59:59.269
It's just beautiful!

867
00:59:59.337 --> 01:00:00.895
And the best part?

868
01:00:01.506 --> 01:00:02.871
Unbreakable.

869
01:00:07.345 --> 01:00:09.245
I don't know what to say.

870
01:00:09.314 --> 01:00:12.772
You think it will be enough?
I mean, to take care of your family?

871
01:00:15.687 --> 01:00:19.054
And maybe this could be
the Jammy Dodger Mark Two.

872
01:00:26.231 --> 01:00:28.256
Well...

873
01:00:29.534 --> 01:00:31.525
...I suppose this is it.

874
01:00:32.037 --> 01:00:35.097
Thank you... for the lift.

875
01:00:35.173 --> 01:00:37.038
You're welcome.

876
01:00:39.277 --> 01:00:41.142
- Roddy?
- Yes.

877
01:00:41.212 --> 01:00:45.148
I don't suppose you'd have time
to give me a quick tour?

878
01:00:45.216 --> 01:00:46.240
Of course.

879
01:00:46.317 --> 01:00:48.547
I'd love to meet your family.

880
01:00:52.157 --> 01:00:53.556
Hello?

881
01:00:54.225 --> 01:00:57.217
Hello, hello, hello? Anybody home?

882
01:00:57.295 --> 01:00:59.820
Wouldn't you know it?
All out, every one of them.

883
01:00:59.898 --> 01:01:01.229
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

884
01:01:07.739 --> 01:01:10.469
- What is that?
- Oh, that.

885
01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:14.174
That's my master bedroom.

886
01:01:14.245 --> 01:01:17.146
- It's a cage.
- No! It's not, actually.

887
01:01:17.215 --> 01:01:18.876
Then why the lock and bars?

888
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:22.750
That's my... home security system.

889
01:01:25.056 --> 01:01:28.321
So much to see,
so little time to see it in. Shall we?

890
01:01:28.393 --> 01:01:29.860
Roddy.

891
01:01:29.928 --> 01:01:33.921
You're all alone up here, aren't you?

892
01:01:37.435 --> 01:01:39.494
Goal!

893
01:01:39.571 --> 01:01:40.765
Who's that?

894
01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:44.966
That would be... my brother!

895
01:01:45.043 --> 01:01:47.944
What a game! I can't believe it!

896
01:01:48.012 --> 01:01:51.277
He shoots! He scores!
Back of the net! Group hug.

897
01:01:53.451 --> 01:01:55.646
- Oh, hello.
- Rita, this is...

898
01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:57.051
-...Rupert!
- What?

899
01:01:57.122 --> 01:01:59.420
Rupert, this is Rita. She's been

900
01:01:59.491 --> 01:02:03.222
so looking forward
to meeting my brother.

901
01:02:03.124 --> 01:02:05.922
- Ah!
- Obviously, there's not a huge family resemblance.

902
01:02:06.564 --> 01:02:10.796
I rather got the brains and...
Well, actually, I got the looks too,

903
01:02:10.869 --> 01:02:13.133
but we're very close,
aren't we, Rupert?

904
01:02:13.571 --> 01:02:16.506
Well, how time flies
when you're having fun! Still...

905
01:02:16.574 --> 01:02:18.041
On with the tour, shall we?

906
01:02:18.109 --> 01:02:19.337
Hello, Sid.

907
01:02:19.410 --> 01:02:21.173
Hello, Rita.

908
01:02:21.246 --> 01:02:24.477
- How's your dad?
- Better, yeah. Thanks for asking.

909
01:02:24.549 --> 01:02:26.399
Rupert?

910
01:02:27.819 --> 01:02:31.016
What was that all about?
Come here, you poor little thing.

911
01:02:31.089 --> 01:02:35.048
Look at his little face.
You ever seen anything so pathetic?

912
01:02:35.126 --> 01:02:38.174
Brothers?

913
01:02:38.429 --> 01:02:41.592
All Mr. Lonely has got
is a couple of dolls

914
01:02:41.666 --> 01:02:44.567
and a little wheel
to run around in his cage.

915
01:02:44.636 --> 01:02:46.695
This is too sweet!

916
01:02:46.771 --> 01:02:50.002
What a lo-o-o-o-o-o-oser!

917
01:02:55.446 --> 01:02:57.437
It's OK, Roddy.

918
01:02:59.484 --> 01:03:00.815
OK?

919
01:03:00.885 --> 01:03:05.379
Look at this place, Rita.
Look at my home. It's a palace!

920
01:03:05.456 --> 01:03:09.119
I can do whatever I want
whenever I want to.

921
01:03:09.194 --> 01:03:12.254
I'd say that's a little more
than OK, wouldn't you?

922
01:03:12.330 --> 01:03:15.595
What do I need a family for?
What do I need friends for?

923
01:03:16.868 --> 01:03:20.065
I'm sorry, but if you have
everything you need, then...

924
01:03:20.138 --> 01:03:24.768
...I really have to get going. I have
a serious infestation to deal with.

925
01:03:26.344 --> 01:03:29.211
I'll say goodbye, then...

926
01:03:30.915 --> 01:03:32.883
...Roddy St. James...

927
01:03:32.951 --> 01:03:34.885
...of Kensington.

928
01:04:08.453 --> 01:04:10.717
Lonely

929
01:04:10.788 --> 01:04:13.416
I'm Mr. Lonely

930
01:04:13.491 --> 01:04:16.255
I have nobody

931
01:04:16.327 --> 01:04:19.421
For my own

932
01:04:23.368 --> 01:04:25.666
<i>Only ten minutes left until halftime.</i>

933
01:04:25.737 --> 01:04:27.398
<i>And what an amazing match...</i>

934
01:04:27.472 --> 01:04:30.270
Come on, England! This is fantastic!

935
01:04:30.341 --> 01:04:33.367
<i>A rare attack here by Germany, but it comes to very little.</i>

936
01:04:34.479 --> 01:04:38.780
Come here, bro!
Rupert's missing his Rodsy-Wodsy.

937
01:04:41.286 --> 01:04:43.117
Here, have a cheese puff.

938
01:04:44.589 --> 01:04:46.250
Have another.

939
01:04:46.324 --> 01:04:47.951
Here you go.

940
01:04:48.026 --> 01:04:50.688
No! Duh.
You're supposed to eat them.

941
01:04:50.762 --> 01:04:53.026
Move... over.

942
01:04:53.097 --> 01:04:55.622
- What?
- Move over!

943
01:04:56.634 --> 01:04:59.296
I'll take some of that.

944
01:05:00.638 --> 01:05:04.472
Word of advice, mate.
Take it easy with the drink, seriously,

945
01:05:04.542 --> 01:05:07.306
or you'll never make it to halftime.

946
01:05:09.614 --> 01:05:10.911
What did you say?

947
01:05:11.215 --> 01:05:14.446
The bathroom.
I'm waiting till halftime.

948
01:05:14.519 --> 01:05:16.749
I don't want to miss any of the game.

949
01:05:16.821 --> 01:05:20.313
Halftime. He's waiting till halftime!

950
01:05:20.391 --> 01:05:23.383
Those floodgates won't hold forever!

951
01:05:24.062 --> 01:05:26.656
No! Not the master cable!

952
01:05:26.931 --> 01:05:28.922
What do you want it for anyway?

953
01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.734
<i>Oh, you'll see, come
the World Cup Final this afternoon.</i>

954
01:05:34.839 --> 01:05:37.501
Half... time.

955
01:05:38.509 --> 01:05:42.445
Half... time.

956
01:05:42.513 --> 01:05:46.176
Of course. That's The Toad's plan!
That's why he needs the cable!

957
01:05:46.250 --> 01:05:49.617
When everyone goes to the toilet,
the city will be flushed away!

958
01:05:49.687 --> 01:05:51.348
Come with me.

959
01:05:51.923 --> 01:05:53.891
What about the game?

960
01:05:53.958 --> 01:05:55.789
<i>And what a game it is!</i>

961
01:05:55.860 --> 01:05:58.886
<i>Oh, a nasty fall there for Ray Bowers.</i>

962
01:05:58.963 --> 01:06:01.022
Can you see all right, Fergus?

963
01:06:01.099 --> 01:06:02.566
Yes, thanks, Mum.

964
01:06:02.633 --> 01:06:07.036
Where's your helmets? Which one's
the quarterback? Pick up the ball!

965
01:06:07.105 --> 01:06:10.506
Oh! These Brits don't know
the first thing about football.

966
01:06:12.143 --> 01:06:15.977
Enjoy your last moments,
you egregious vermin.

967
01:06:16.047 --> 01:06:18.481
I've got Rita, boss! I've got Rita!

968
01:06:18.549 --> 01:06:21.643
Get off me, you lab reject!

969
01:06:21.719 --> 01:06:24.004
Ha! You missed.

970
01:06:27.425 --> 01:06:29.086
Ah, Rita.

971
01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:32.152
It's so good of you to return the cable.

972
01:06:32.663 --> 01:06:33.925
Bonjour.

973
01:06:34.779 --> 01:06:35.899
Hey!

974
01:06:37.502 --> 01:06:40.494
At last! It's mine!

975
01:06:47.011 --> 01:06:49.887
Just take it.

976
01:06:51.916 --> 01:06:54.151
Let there be light!

977
01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:06.060
Please don't flush me, Roddy!
I can't survive down there!

978
01:07:06.130 --> 01:07:08.690
I've gone soft!

979
01:07:08.766 --> 01:07:11.360
Sid, I want you to flush me.
I'm going back.

980
01:07:11.436 --> 01:07:12.528
Back?

981
01:07:12.603 --> 01:07:15.868
Rita's in terrible danger.
Everyone's in terrible danger!

982
01:07:15.940 --> 01:07:17.703
Now, you like it here, don't you?

983
01:07:17.775 --> 01:07:21.404
Oh, yes, Roddy.
I like it here very much.

984
01:07:21.479 --> 01:07:25.006
And if I leave you, will you be good
to Tabitha, the little girl?

985
01:07:25.083 --> 01:07:29.543
I'll be as good as gold to her, Roddy.
And I will be the best pet ever!

986
01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:31.087
Then the place is all yours.

987
01:07:31.155 --> 01:07:32.679
- Sweet!
- Great.

988
01:07:32.757 --> 01:07:36.090
Let's get the bubbles going.
I've got a big job to do down there.

989
01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:38.060
Right away, sir!

990
01:07:38.896 --> 01:07:39.920
So long, Sid.

991
01:07:39.997 --> 01:07:44.525
So long, Rodnick Saint Something
of Someplace or other.

992
01:07:44.602 --> 01:07:46.399
Geronimo!

993
01:07:49.073 --> 01:07:53.009
And, lo, a chosen one
shall come down from above,

994
01:07:53.077 --> 01:07:56.569
and he shall be our savior
from the Great Flood!

995
01:07:58.950 --> 01:08:00.247
I'm terribly sorry.

996
01:08:00.318 --> 01:08:03.754
<i>Just two minutes left till halftime!
Incredible!</i>

997
01:08:03.821 --> 01:08:06.016
<i>- It's a fantasy start for England.</i>
- Rita!

998
01:08:06.090 --> 01:08:08.581
<i>England leads Germany
by three goals to one.</i>

999
01:08:08.659 --> 01:08:11.787
<i>What an amazing game
this is turning out to be!</i>

1000
01:08:11.863 --> 01:08:15.812
The grand opening.

1001
01:08:23.441 --> 01:08:26.501
<i>And the referee again has to bring play to a halt.</i>

1002
01:08:27.178 --> 01:08:28.202
Rita!

1003
01:08:28.279 --> 01:08:30.770
Fans for the fans!

1004
01:08:30.848 --> 01:08:34.375
Extra! Pied Piper
lures thousands to their death!

1005
01:08:34.452 --> 01:08:36.613
Balloons!

1006
01:08:43.394 --> 01:08:44.952
Rita!

1007
01:08:48.733 --> 01:08:49.927
Rita!

1008
01:08:50.001 --> 01:08:50.990
Roddy!

1009
01:08:51.068 --> 01:08:54.936
I'm sorry. I've been such a fool.
You were right about me and everything.

1010
01:08:55.006 --> 01:08:58.942
I should have admitted it, but I was
afraid you wouldn't like me anymore.

1011
01:08:59.010 --> 01:09:01.808
Do you think we can talk
about this after you rescue me?

1012
01:09:01.879 --> 01:09:04.507
Of course. There's no time.
When that whistle blows

1013
01:09:04.582 --> 01:09:07.949
and everyone Up Top goes to the toilet,
it'll flush away the city.

1014
01:09:08.019 --> 01:09:10.112
I know. And my family
are all down there.

1015
01:09:10.188 --> 01:09:11.746
We've got to warn everyone.

1016
01:09:11.822 --> 01:09:13.312
Stop them!

1017
01:09:21.183 --> 01:09:22.343
Oh, dear.

1018
01:09:29.874 --> 01:09:31.307
Whoa! Whitey!

1019
01:09:31.642 --> 01:09:34.543
I saw an opportunity and I seized it.

1020
01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:40.044
So you thought you could
make a fool of The Toad, eh?

1021
01:09:42.353 --> 01:09:44.344
You don't need us for that.

1022
01:09:44.422 --> 01:09:47.050
You think you're so clever,
don't you?

1023
01:09:47.124 --> 01:09:49.752
Well, I'll be the one laughing

1024
01:09:49.827 --> 01:09:54.059
when every last revolting rat
is flushed away!

1025
01:09:54.131 --> 01:09:57.794
For I shall repopulate the city...

1026
01:09:57.868 --> 01:10:01.836
...with these!

1027
01:10:03.547 --> 01:10:05.607
Nasty.

1028
01:10:05.810 --> 01:10:09.507
- Is this the Glorious Amphibian Dawn?
- Anything for you.

1029
01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:10.877
- Can I have a pony?
- No.

1030
01:10:10.948 --> 01:10:12.506
- A puppy?
- We'll talk about it.

1031
01:10:12.583 --> 01:10:14.073
- Can we talk about it now?
- No.

1032
01:10:14.151 --> 01:10:16.676
Can I have a puppy?

1033
01:10:16.754 --> 01:10:20.019
You can't all have puppies!
Please! Daddy's working!

1034
01:10:20.091 --> 01:10:22.389
We need to get down
and pull out that cable.

1035
01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:23.688
How?

1036
01:10:23.761 --> 01:10:25.524
It's impossible.

1037
01:10:26.897 --> 01:10:29.866
England is winning.
Anything's possible.

1038
01:10:32.970 --> 01:10:34.301
Turn it off, Whitey!

1039
01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:37.840
- Come on!
- They're getting away!

1040
01:10:40.611 --> 01:10:42.272
Oh. Hi, boss.

1041
01:10:43.114 --> 01:10:46.049
Whitey!
They're biting my bottom! Help!

1042
01:10:46.117 --> 01:10:47.880
I'm coming, Spike!

1043
01:10:49.487 --> 01:10:51.717
You fools! Grab them!

1044
01:10:51.789 --> 01:10:53.882
Top floor, lingerie, housewares

1045
01:10:53.958 --> 01:10:55.789
and certain doom!

1046
01:11:09.473 --> 01:11:12.636
Do I have to do everything myself?!

1047
01:11:20.251 --> 01:11:24.745
<i>There goes the whistle for halftime!
We'll be back in a few minutes.</i>

1048
01:11:24.822 --> 01:11:29.452
You're too late to do anything!
You and your kind are finished!

1049
01:11:29.527 --> 01:11:33.793
Oh, yeah? Well, come and get us
then, you warty windbag.

1050
01:11:38.831 --> 01:11:41.581
Oh, no!

1051
01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:58.181
The gate. Back this way! Come on!

1052
01:11:58.806 --> 01:12:01.157
Rita!

1053
01:12:01.225 --> 01:12:03.523
If I'm going,
you're both coming with me!

1054
01:12:03.594 --> 01:12:05.118
Just go, Roddy!

1055
01:12:11.869 --> 01:12:12.961
That's it.

1056
01:12:14.405 --> 01:12:15.633
Roddy!

1057
01:12:15.706 --> 01:12:17.173
Stop moving!

1058
01:12:17.241 --> 01:12:19.510
Come and get me,
you big, slimy airbag!

1059
01:12:21.178 --> 01:12:22.167
Roddy, look out!

1060
01:12:24.382 --> 01:12:26.256
Yes!

1061
01:12:36.594 --> 01:12:37.686
Le Frog!

1062
01:12:43.267 --> 01:12:44.564
Let's finish this.

1063
01:12:44.635 --> 01:12:46.227
Let me go!

1064
01:12:46.303 --> 01:12:48.637
Goodbye, rat!

1065
01:12:48.681 --> 01:12:50.444
Rita!

1066
01:12:58.349 --> 01:13:00.010
Feeling a little tongue-tied?

1067
01:13:00.084 --> 01:13:01.210
Impossible!

1068
01:13:01.285 --> 01:13:02.684
Toodle-oo.

1069
01:13:02.857 --> 01:13:06.681
No!

1070
01:13:12.329 --> 01:13:15.162
- Wave! Wave!
- England!

1071
01:13:15.232 --> 01:13:17.666
No, giant wave!

1072
01:13:21.439 --> 01:13:23.600
Please work. Please work.
Please work!

1073
01:13:46.897 --> 01:13:48.455
High five!

1074
01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:50.631
Oh, yeah.

1075
01:13:54.405 --> 01:13:56.396
Look! It's Roddy and Rita!

1076
01:13:56.474 --> 01:13:57.998
Good on you, girl!

1077
01:13:58.075 --> 01:14:00.566
Hooray for Millicent Bystander!

1078
01:14:00.644 --> 01:14:02.236
Millicent!

1079
01:14:02.313 --> 01:14:05.874
Millicent!

1080
01:14:05.950 --> 01:14:08.578
You're a hero, Roddy.

1081
01:14:09.099 --> 01:14:11.499
Big deal.

1082
01:14:14.325 --> 01:14:16.122
You wretched vermin!

1083
01:14:16.193 --> 01:14:18.787
I'll make you pay for this!

1084
01:14:18.863 --> 01:14:22.890
Give it a rest, cousin.
And get your kids a puppy.

1085
01:14:25.936 --> 01:14:27.130
Rita...

1086
01:14:28.572 --> 01:14:32.906
...I was wondering, if you do build
a Jammy Dodger Mark Two...

1087
01:14:34.478 --> 01:14:37.606
...you wouldn't happen to need
a first mate, would you?

1088
01:14:42.753 --> 01:14:42.820
Left a good job in the city

1089
01:14:42.820 --> 01:14:46.517
Left a good job in the city

1090
01:14:48.025 --> 01:14:52.689
Workin' for the man every night and day

1091
01:14:53.130 --> 01:14:54.461
Rollin'

1092
01:14:54.532 --> 01:14:57.365
Rollin' on the river

1093
01:14:57.434 --> 01:15:01.165
- Rollin' on the river
- ALL: The river

1094
01:15:03.073 --> 01:15:04.233
OK.

1095
01:15:09.580 --> 01:15:13.380
Hello, Tom! Give us a squeeze!

1096
01:15:17.555 --> 01:15:18.681
All right, chaps.

1097
01:15:20.190 --> 01:15:21.851
Big wheel keep on turnin'

1098
01:15:22.526 --> 01:15:25.427
Proud Mary keep on burnin'

1099
01:15:25.496 --> 01:15:28.192
Rollin', rollin'

1100
01:15:28.265 --> 01:15:30.256
Rollin' on the river

1101
01:15:44.415 --> 01:15:46.610
I love a happy ending.

1102
01:15:46.684 --> 01:15:51.018
You've gone soft! I like unhappy
endings, with lots of violence.

1103
01:15:54.525 --> 01:15:57.585
Are you happy now, Spike?

1104
01:16:03.734 --> 01:16:05.725
- Shall we?
- Go for it.

1105
01:16:07.293 --> 01:16:08.726
Big wheel keep on turnin'

1106
01:16:08.906 --> 01:16:11.773
Proud Mary keep on burnin'

1107
01:16:27.191 --> 01:16:30.456
- Where are we going?
- I have no idea.

1108
01:16:30.527 --> 01:16:33.428
But we're gonna get there really fast!

1109
01:16:33.497 --> 01:16:35.897
I'm coming, Mr. Jones! I'm coming!

1110
01:16:49.146 --> 01:16:51.949
Ah, this is the life.

1111
01:16:51.949 --> 01:16:52.108
Ah, this is the life.

1112
01:16:52.182 --> 01:16:53.468
Roddy, I'm home!

1113
01:16:53.668 --> 01:16:55.869
And I've brought you a new friend!
