00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:14.304
<i>An unprecedented meteor shower
falling off the coast of Tokyo.</i>

2
00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:18.134
<i>The entire city is mesmerised
by this incredible sight.</i>

3
00:00:19.144 --> 00:00:20.894
<i>Two hours after the first contact</i>

4
00:00:21.062 --> 00:00:24.614
<i>an unidentified enemy
has reached our coastlines</i>

5
00:00:24.615 --> 00:00:27.043
<i>in a swift and militaristic attack.</i>

6
00:00:30.905 --> 00:00:32.993
<i>Right now, one thing is clear.</i>

7
00:00:32.994 --> 00:00:34.783
<i>The world is at war.</i>

8
00:00:47.774 --> 00:00:50.333
<i>At 14:46 Pacific Standard Time</i>

9
00:00:51.042 --> 00:00:53.753
<i>12 different locations
across the globe were breached</i>

10
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.823
<i>in what appears a coordinated
attack by an unknown enemy.</i>

11
00:00:58.516 --> 00:01:01.060
<i>All breaches were along the coastline</i>

12
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.971
<i>in what is a campaign of rapid dominance.</i>

13
00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:07.691
<i>This is a textbook military invasion.</i>

14
00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:10.235
<i>There are massive casualties in New York.</i>

15
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.955
<i>Defensive lines are being set up in Boston.</i>

16
00:01:14.165 --> 00:01:16.923
<i>And at 13:15 Zulu time,</i>

17
00:01:16.924 --> 00:01:19.995
<i>we lost communications
with San Francisco and San Diego.</i>

18
00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:21.413
<i>Their status is unknown.</i>

19
00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:25.521
<i>What we do know is that we are the last</i>

20
00:01:25.822 --> 00:01:28.053
<i>offensive force on the West Coast.</i>

21
00:01:28.463 --> 00:01:30.981
<i>We cannot lose Los Angeles.</i>

22
00:01:35.011 --> 00:01:38.272
<i>We have five birds down
two klicks west of CP Victory.</i>

23
00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:41.975
<i>We're hit, we're hit!
Tighten your asses, we're going down!</i>

24
00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:43.852
<i>Command and control is down.</i>

25
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.313
<i>Civilians in need of support
two klicks northeast.</i>

26
00:01:46.523 --> 00:01:49.057
<i>Cables inbound.
Engage your sectors of fire, over.</i>

27
00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:52.069
Oh, shit.
Shit, shit, shit.

28
00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:23.481
<i>Good wednesday morning.</i>

29
00:02:23.482 --> 00:02:26.506
<i>It's 94.5 with the Surfrider
Foundation Morning Surf Report.</i>

30
00:02:27.021 --> 00:02:29.565
<i>Surfers, hard northeast conditions
blowing out there</i>

31
00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:31.880
<i>the ocean slopping
and chopping things up.</i>

32
00:02:31.881 --> 00:02:33.778
<i>There is some size starting to build.</i>

33
00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:36.655
Come on. Come on.

34
00:02:56.384 --> 00:02:58.427
Morning, staff sergeant.
Morning, staff sergeant.

35
00:02:58.636 --> 00:03:00.178
Morning, staff sergeant.

36
00:03:00.388 --> 00:03:02.498
Morning, staff sergeant.
Morning, staff sergeant.

37
00:03:02.807 --> 00:03:04.641
Morning, staff sergeant.

38
00:03:11.274 --> 00:03:13.142
Morning, you little prick.

39
00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:29.715
You know what they say.

40
00:03:30.016 --> 00:03:32.028
You're only as old as you feel,
staff sergeant.

41
00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:34.308
That's what I'm worried about.

42
00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:36.090
I can't feel a damn thing.

43
00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:43.856
<i>To the Pacific for our next report,</i>

44
00:03:43.857 --> 00:03:46.947
<i>where it would appears to be
a small cluster of meteors</i>

45
00:03:46.948 --> 00:03:49.668
<i>is predicted to enter our
atmosphere sometimes</i>

46
00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:51.921
<i>in the early hours
of tomorrow morning.</i>

47
00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:52.981
Go ahead.
<i>They're expected</i>

48
00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:54.676
<i>to strike miles from land,</i>

49
00:03:54.677 --> 00:03:57.120
<i>far into the Pacific Ocean
and with the...</i>

50
00:03:58.237 --> 00:03:59.394
John.

51
00:03:59.395 --> 00:04:00.395
Oh, God.

52
00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:02.900
What's up, Mike?

53
00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:04.371
Hey.

54
00:04:04.996 --> 00:04:07.596
What happened to that picture
of us in Iraq with that camel?

55
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.989
I mean, your girlfriend.

56
00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:11.458
Hey, is this for real?

57
00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:13.496
It's got your signature on it, I said.

58
00:04:13.497 --> 00:04:15.545
That's gotta be a mistake,
he can't write.

59
00:04:16.055 --> 00:04:18.375
No mistake, John.
I did my 20.

60
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.883
I know when to get out.

61
00:04:20.084 --> 00:04:21.986
Come on. You got the box
full of medals,

62
00:04:21.987 --> 00:04:23.461
a file full of commendations.

63
00:04:23.771 --> 00:04:26.298
You can have them.
Seems you like interior decorating.

64
00:04:26.507 --> 00:04:28.060
A Marine's got a shelf life, you know?

65
00:04:28.785 --> 00:04:29.968
After that.

66
00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:31.661
What?
He spoils?

67
00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:33.155
Something like that.

68
00:04:33.564 --> 00:04:36.091
I'll finish my training assignment
with these Marines.

69
00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:37.985
Get them combat ready.

70
00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:40.654
And then I'll be on my merry way.

71
00:04:41.572 --> 00:04:44.992
You know, we could always use
another lean, mean typing machine.

72
00:04:45.201 --> 00:04:46.994
Shit, I ain't built like you, John.

73
00:04:47.495 --> 00:04:49.329
Ugly, slow, soft.

74
00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:53.292
God.

75
00:04:55.044 --> 00:04:57.087
You had to make some
tough calls there, Mike.

76
00:04:59.215 --> 00:05:00.866
Especially that last one.

77
00:05:02.552 --> 00:05:04.912
We all wish your men made it home.

78
00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:08.933
Here we go.

79
00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:19.493
You're expired.

80
00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:21.361
Clear the shelf...

81
00:05:22.363 --> 00:05:23.647
staff sergeant.

82
00:05:36.335 --> 00:05:38.128
Everything I know is in here, John.

83
00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:58.838
<i>What typically would
have been detected months,</i>

84
00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:00.358
<i>if not years, before</i>

85
00:06:00.526 --> 00:06:02.594
<i>surfaced in less than four hours.</i>

86
00:06:02.904 --> 00:06:06.882
<i>These images giving you some idea of
the rate these meteors are travelling.</i>

87
00:06:07.557 --> 00:06:10.827
<i>Scientists are abuzz,
scrambling to try and understand it.</i>

88
00:06:10.995 --> 00:06:13.538
You know, there is something just
extremely uncomfortable

89
00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:15.832
about a man your size sniffing a flower.

90
00:06:16.442 --> 00:06:17.959
What you want is some hydrangeas.

91
00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:20.837
Popular wedding flower,
come in green, blue.

92
00:06:22.105 --> 00:06:23.823
What colour is the
bridesmaids' dresses?

93
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.772
Good question.

94
00:06:25.873 --> 00:06:27.845
You're amazing, just take a whiff.

95
00:06:27.846 --> 00:06:28.637
Come on, smell it.

96
00:06:29.972 --> 00:06:31.348
Yes, pretty girl?

97
00:06:31.657 --> 00:06:34.827
For 300 more, she said we could
have sprays of lilies.

98
00:06:35.436 --> 00:06:36.450
Now, I know it's a lot but,

99
00:06:36.451 --> 00:06:38.688
it'd be so beautiful.
What do you think?

100
00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:40.889
300 dollars?
Goodness gracious.

101
00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:42.343
Well, I think it's a no-brainer.

102
00:06:42.344 --> 00:06:43.796
You're only getting married once.

103
00:06:43.797 --> 00:06:44.611
What you're gonna worry
about 300 bucks?

104
00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:47.181
Thank you, Stavrou. Thank you.
Yeah, no worries.

105
00:06:49.033 --> 00:06:51.003
You know what?
It's your day.

106
00:06:51.128 --> 00:06:52.828
Do whatever you want.

107
00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:57.190
I'm gonna hit you with
something really heavy.

108
00:06:57.191 --> 00:06:57.741
What are you doing?

109
00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:58.992
Busting your balls.

110
00:06:59.201 --> 00:07:00.602
Tomorrow we shop for cakes.

111
00:07:00.811 --> 00:07:02.246
And I can't wait.

112
00:07:02.755 --> 00:07:03.922
I love cake.

113
00:07:16.894 --> 00:07:18.186
Yo, Doc.
What you doing?

114
00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:19.737
Skyping back home.

115
00:07:20.005 --> 00:07:22.124
Is that your girlfriend?
Damn, she fine.

116
00:07:23.901 --> 00:07:25.527
Doc.
My boy.

117
00:07:29.824 --> 00:07:31.533
That's my sister.

118
00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:35.629
Goddamn.

119
00:07:36.038 --> 00:07:39.441
Shoot man, I'm speaking objectively
here, you know what I'm saying?

120
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.169
Alright, no, stop playing!
Stop playing!

121
00:07:43.963 --> 00:07:45.255
May I take a message?

122
00:07:45.464 --> 00:07:47.757
Doc, is it alright if I have
one of those first?

123
00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.920
You eat it at your own risk.

124
00:07:54.056 --> 00:07:55.399
They're very old.

125
00:07:57.727 --> 00:08:00.973
So do you feel that
you're making progress?

126
00:08:01.105 --> 00:08:02.233
Yeah, yeah.

127
00:08:02.234 --> 00:08:03.307
Yeah.

128
00:08:04.942 --> 00:08:06.443
I'm sleeping a lot better.

129
00:08:06.652 --> 00:08:09.279
And then also around the firing range
and everything,

130
00:08:09.747 --> 00:08:11.490
when I first came back
and hear the pop, pop, pop.

131
00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:14.100
I'd get very jumpy
and it would mess with

132
00:08:14.101 --> 00:08:15.827
me a little bit and a little bit of a setback.

133
00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:17.779
But now it, you know...

134
00:08:19.123 --> 00:08:20.432
doesn't bother me.

135
00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:22.792
So I think that's progress.

136
00:08:23.711 --> 00:08:25.879
So, what's the story
with my status, doc?

137
00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:28.675
I mean, are you gonna
clear me for combat?

138
00:08:28.676 --> 00:08:29.466
Because.

139
00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:31.351
Yeah, I feel good.

140
00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.814
Let's meet again next week...

141
00:08:38.017 --> 00:08:40.344
and we'll discuss it, Ok?

142
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:43.883
Alright, thank you.

143
00:08:44.384 --> 00:08:45.482
Thank you very much, doc.

144
00:08:53.783 --> 00:08:56.952
Harris' girl is making the dude
organise his entire wedding

145
00:08:57.119 --> 00:08:58.578
two weeks before we deploy.

146
00:08:59.997 --> 00:09:02.800
I say the chick's busting his balls
like nobody's business.

147
00:09:05.711 --> 00:09:08.213
But he got two weeks to get it done
because we're out of here.

148
00:09:08.422 --> 00:09:11.583
So I just came by to visit you
one last time before we leave.

149
00:09:12.093 --> 00:09:14.309
And I brought Dad's five iron with me.

150
00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:16.813
And you know what that means.

151
00:09:17.682 --> 00:09:19.850
Me and the boys are gonna
go out tonight,

152
00:09:19.851 --> 00:09:21.301
continue the tradition.

153
00:09:22.353 --> 00:09:24.062
Have a good time, you know?

154
00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.133
I'll see you soon, bro.

155
00:09:32.822 --> 00:09:33.881
See you soon.

156
00:09:37.576 --> 00:09:39.619
Motown, give me my boots.
I'm going skiing.

157
00:09:39.787 --> 00:09:41.371
Oh, that's how you do it, baby.

158
00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:45.583
Here they come.

159
00:09:45.993 --> 00:09:47.234
Don't mess this up, man.

160
00:09:47.235 --> 00:09:48.853
They cannot know that you're a virgin.

161
00:09:48.963 --> 00:09:51.548
How do you know I...
Who says I'm a virgin?

162
00:09:51.757 --> 00:09:53.383
We know you are virgin.
Look at your face.

163
00:09:53.592 --> 00:09:54.853
What are you telling her?

164
00:09:55.254 --> 00:09:56.269
Telling her what?

165
00:09:57.388 --> 00:09:59.848
Oh, come on, you guys.
You're killing me.

166
00:10:02.301 --> 00:10:03.352
That dog gonna hunt!

167
00:10:03.353 --> 00:10:05.136
Damn, Daktari, you can play, man.

168
00:10:05.563 --> 00:10:07.397
We have courses in Nigeria, Imlay.

169
00:10:07.706 --> 00:10:09.444
Shit. How am I supposed to know, man?

170
00:10:09.445 --> 00:10:10.868
It's an American game, right?

171
00:10:11.777 --> 00:10:13.548
Adukwu's our Navy corpsman.

172
00:10:13.549 --> 00:10:15.432
He's like a medic.
No, not like a medic.

173
00:10:15.457 --> 00:10:17.741
Medic is the Army.
I'm a Navy corpsman, it's different.

174
00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:19.659
Well, sailor, yes.

175
00:10:19.869 --> 00:10:21.369
I came here to become a doctor.

176
00:10:26.334 --> 00:10:27.392
Slow down.

177
00:10:29.003 --> 00:10:30.503
That's like number five.

178
00:10:30.713 --> 00:10:32.047
How many have you had?

179
00:10:32.256 --> 00:10:33.490
No, I'm good.

180
00:10:33.491 --> 00:10:34.568
Now, this guy here,

181
00:10:34.869 --> 00:10:36.952
Mr. Lenihan.
Hey.

182
00:10:37.261 --> 00:10:39.213
His mom signed so
he could join up at 17.

183
00:10:39.214 --> 00:10:40.180
And...

184
00:10:40.581 --> 00:10:44.092
I look after him because this boy
don't know his ass from a hot rock.

185
00:10:49.231 --> 00:10:50.945
Not on my truck, dude!

186
00:10:51.246 --> 00:10:52.725
Easy, now. Easy, buddy.

187
00:10:52.735 --> 00:10:54.861
Oh, yeah!
Not on my truck.

188
00:10:55.371 --> 00:10:56.137
Toast.

189
00:10:56.538 --> 00:10:57.538
To Lenihan.

190
00:10:57.539 --> 00:10:58.623
To Lenihan!

191
00:10:58.624 --> 00:10:59.708
Good luck, rookie.

192
00:11:00.117 --> 00:11:01.326
Retreat, hell!

193
00:11:01.835 --> 00:11:04.946
<i>Emergency developing throughout
NASA and the space community.</i>

194
00:11:05.155 --> 00:11:09.242
<i>We now know that meteors will land
off the coasts of eight different cities..</i>

195
00:11:09.651 --> 00:11:11.227
<i>And that number could keep rising.</i>

196
00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:14.614
<i>Evacuations now under way
in Southern California,</i>

197
00:11:14.723 --> 00:11:17.016
<i>moving the population back
from the coastline.</i>

198
00:11:17.193 --> 00:11:20.153
<i>But a lot of curious people
are clamouring for views.</i>

199
00:11:20.262 --> 00:11:21.904
What are you doing up so early?

200
00:11:21.905 --> 00:11:22.510
Lieutenant.

201
00:11:23.811 --> 00:11:25.100
Still gotta get used to that.

202
00:11:29.838 --> 00:11:30.880
This thing right?

203
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:32.325
Here.

204
00:11:32.626 --> 00:11:33.633
You want me to do it?
It's tricky.

205
00:11:34.352 --> 00:11:35.769
They gotta be parallel to the deck.

206
00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:37.454
That's the whole thing with these bars.

207
00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:39.791
Don't forget to call Mr. Gilliam, ok?

208
00:11:39.792 --> 00:11:40.415
Ok.

209
00:11:40.783 --> 00:11:41.834
Call me later.
I'll call you later.

210
00:11:46.664 --> 00:11:48.067
That's my baby.

211
00:11:48.368 --> 00:11:49.368
Alright.

212
00:12:07.476 --> 00:12:08.902
Let's go!
Move!

213
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:16.777
Quick time!
March!

214
00:12:20.948 --> 00:12:22.101
Marines!

215
00:12:22.302 --> 00:12:25.293
Into the trucks and report
to your company! Let's go!

216
00:12:25.703 --> 00:12:27.036
Move it!
Let's move!

217
00:12:27.346 --> 00:12:28.405
Move it!

218
00:12:28.914 --> 00:12:29.962
Load them up!

219
00:12:30.263 --> 00:12:31.358
Move it!

220
00:12:31.667 --> 00:12:33.393
What's going on, first sergeant?

221
00:12:35.504 --> 00:12:37.689
Meteors hitting off California now,

222
00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.884
but they got the whole
goddamn base being mobilised.

223
00:12:41.093 --> 00:12:42.916
I'm bringing you back
to the company, Mike.

224
00:12:44.017 --> 00:12:45.113
They need you.

225
00:12:46.315 --> 00:12:47.424
First sergeant.

226
00:12:49.268 --> 00:12:51.545
All hands on deck, staff sergeant.

227
00:12:56.592 --> 00:12:57.971
Tacking you heard
we might be mobilising?

228
00:12:57.972 --> 00:12:58.972
Yes, sir.

229
00:12:59.611 --> 00:13:00.828
Moving you up to squad leader.

230
00:13:00.896 --> 00:13:03.389
It's a big responsibility
but you can handle it.

231
00:13:03.499 --> 00:13:04.532
Thank you, sir.

232
00:13:05.409 --> 00:13:08.286
Staff Sergeant Beck is being
replaced by Staff Sergeant Nantz.

233
00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:10.906
What do you know about him?

234
00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:14.101
He's a very dedicated Marine.

235
00:13:15.211 --> 00:13:16.645
Don't bullshit me, corporal.

236
00:13:17.796 --> 00:13:19.581
What'd you hear about his last tour?

237
00:13:20.716 --> 00:13:23.460
Just the grimy details that everybody
else already knows.

238
00:13:24.261 --> 00:13:26.721
But at the end of the day,
you're our lieutenant,

239
00:13:26.889 --> 00:13:28.824
and we take our orders from you, sir.

240
00:13:32.728 --> 00:13:36.648
So you're gonna be assigned to 1st Platoon
under Second Lieutenant Martinez.

241
00:13:37.733 --> 00:13:41.636
His platoon sergeant's on leave,
so you're gonna have to suck it up.

242
00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:45.073
Yeah, so, here's the lieutenant
right up here, 1 o'clock.

243
00:13:45.941 --> 00:13:47.158
He's a kid, Mike.

244
00:13:48.043 --> 00:13:49.877
Right out of officer training school.

245
00:13:50.087 --> 00:13:52.713
He's only been with us a month,
but I think he's sharp.

246
00:13:53.457 --> 00:13:56.793
It's just an evacuation, buddy.
He's in charge.

247
00:13:57.044 --> 00:13:58.946
Just keep an eye on him?

248
00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:04.651
Just don't lose my paperwork.

249
00:14:05.427 --> 00:14:07.595
Lieutenant.
Good afternoon, staff sergeant.

250
00:14:07.805 --> 00:14:09.597
Happy to meet you.
Thank you, sir.

251
00:14:09.765 --> 00:14:12.273
We're being called in to help
with an evacuation, lieutenant?

252
00:14:12.674 --> 00:14:13.868
For these meteors?

253
00:14:13.936 --> 00:14:15.236
I assume so.

254
00:14:15.604 --> 00:14:18.356
Whatever it is, I'm just happy to finally
get out in the field to command.

255
00:14:18.607 --> 00:14:22.627
<i>At approximately 4:42 am Pacific
Standard Time, the meteors impacted...</i>

256
00:14:23.095 --> 00:14:24.461
Who the hell took my tortellini?

257
00:14:24.862 --> 00:14:25.888
You got tortellini?

258
00:14:25.998 --> 00:14:27.190
You think this is some kind
of just drill or what?

259
00:14:27.191 --> 00:14:28.151
Get ready, man.

260
00:14:28.176 --> 00:14:29.976
Get ready.
It's serious, ok?

261
00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:36.568
<i>Meteors continue to fall
off the coast of California,</i>

262
00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:38.242
<i>Ireland and the Bay of Bengal...</i>

263
00:14:38.552 --> 00:14:39.094
Corporal.

264
00:14:39.503 --> 00:14:40.645
Corporal. Corporal.

265
00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:41.454
Corporal.
Yeah?

266
00:14:41.455 --> 00:14:43.189
It's probably just
a training exercise, right.

267
00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:45.208
No, man. They're shifting
Nantz into our unit.

268
00:14:45.209 --> 00:14:46.467
Something's must be going on.

269
00:14:46.635 --> 00:14:48.122
That's great!
The guy wants out of the

270
00:14:48.123 --> 00:14:49.762
Marine Corps and now
we're stuck with him.

271
00:14:50.272 --> 00:14:51.923
Stavs!
You got tortellini?

272
00:14:53.008 --> 00:14:54.967
I heard Nantz kicked ass his last tour.

273
00:14:54.977 --> 00:14:57.645
I mean he went into that compound
alone and killed like 10 insurgents.

274
00:14:57.813 --> 00:15:00.565
That's what you heard, Lenihan?
Yes Sir.

275
00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:01.376
Yeah.

276
00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:03.801
Johnson in Foxtrot told me
that he was going on like some...

277
00:15:04.144 --> 00:15:05.036
Don't worry about it.

278
00:15:05.245 --> 00:15:07.255
Let's go, this is serious.
What the hell did I do?

279
00:15:08.323 --> 00:15:10.291
Nantz got a couple guys killed
on his last tour.

280
00:15:10.559 --> 00:15:11.642
What are you talking about?

281
00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:12.741
That's the story.

282
00:15:12.842 --> 00:15:14.220
Lockett's brother was one.

283
00:15:14.329 --> 00:15:16.437
So I know you didn't know, but...
Lockett! Nope!

284
00:15:16.438 --> 00:15:17.524
But don't worry about it.

285
00:15:18.542 --> 00:15:20.835
Looks like we're getting
into some heavy shit.

286
00:15:21.086 --> 00:15:22.414
It's been my experience, lieutenant,

287
00:15:22.715 --> 00:15:24.556
heavy shit is highly overrated.

288
00:15:25.165 --> 00:15:26.447
Look, staff sergeant,

289
00:15:26.948 --> 00:15:28.143
let's just be clear.

290
00:15:28.594 --> 00:15:30.578
I know your rep,
know what you've done.

291
00:15:30.846 --> 00:15:33.106
This is my platoon.
These are my men.

292
00:15:33.515 --> 00:15:35.168
Not gonna have a problem, are we?

293
00:15:35.193 --> 00:15:36.943
No problem, sir.
She's all yours.

294
00:15:37.144 --> 00:15:40.288
<i>It appears our initial assumptions
were wrong.</i>

295
00:15:42.775 --> 00:15:43.992
Listen up!

296
00:15:44.117 --> 00:15:48.029
Once you get your weapon get your gear,
get your munitions, move outside!

297
00:15:50.866 --> 00:15:52.651
Hey guy! We got white chocolate
rap from my man.

298
00:15:52.652 --> 00:15:54.135
That should finish the new mix, right?

299
00:15:54.203 --> 00:15:58.172
<i>National Guard troops have flown in
to evacuate surrounding beach areas</i>

300
00:15:58.173 --> 00:16:01.009
<i>and we have word
the military is now deploying.</i>

301
00:16:01.919 --> 00:16:04.479
That's us. That's us!
That's us!

302
00:16:05.547 --> 00:16:08.366
Calling military for a meteor shower?
I don't know why they're happy.

303
00:16:09.176 --> 00:16:11.301
<i>A meteor that just hit the ocean.</i>

304
00:16:11.302 --> 00:16:14.016
<i>A large plumes of smoke are coming up.</i>

305
00:16:14.317 --> 00:16:15.715
<i>Visibility is getting worse as we.</i>

306
00:16:15.724 --> 00:16:19.994
These objects were completely undetected
until they entered our atmosphere.

307
00:16:20.104 --> 00:16:23.481
NASA estimates that they are not hitting
the water at terminal velocity.

308
00:16:23.691 --> 00:16:26.317
They're slowing down, before impact.

309
00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.312
These objects in question,

310
00:16:30.337 --> 00:16:32.788
are falling into the ocean
in tightly packed clusters

311
00:16:32.789 --> 00:16:35.251
10 miles outside of a major
population centre.

312
00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:38.275
Thermal imaging from the Hubble
telescope shows us that,

313
00:16:38.476 --> 00:16:41.866
within each cluster is a central
object much larger than the others.

314
00:16:42.175 --> 00:16:45.302
Now, these central objects
are all the same geometric shape.

315
00:16:45.512 --> 00:16:47.447
They appear mechanical in nature.

316
00:16:47.965 --> 00:16:50.541
This is not a meteor shower, Marines.

317
00:16:50.551 --> 00:16:53.711
We are in Threatcon Delta.
That's right.

318
00:16:53.721 --> 00:16:56.814
Come on.
All units, gear up.

319
00:16:57.724 --> 00:16:58.766
Be ready to move.

320
00:16:59.701 --> 00:17:01.052
Combat situation.

321
00:17:01.461 --> 00:17:02.846
It's what I've been training for.

322
00:17:05.899 --> 00:17:07.568
<i>I am just now being told that one of the</i>

323
00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:09.677
<i>Coast Guard cutters has
issued a mayday.</i>

324
00:17:09.886 --> 00:17:12.146
<i>It is difficult to see, and...
Oh, my gosh!</i>

325
00:17:12.156 --> 00:17:14.800
<i>There is just another meteor
that just hit the ocean</i>

326
00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:18.561
<i>and it's the closest one yet,
right behind those cutters.</i>

327
00:17:19.171 --> 00:17:21.505
<i>Two or three meteors just impacted.</i>

328
00:17:23.249 --> 00:17:24.074
Shit.

329
00:17:24.242 --> 00:17:26.211
<i>Do you have any more
information in the studio?</i>

330
00:17:26.212 --> 00:17:27.319
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

331
00:17:27.963 --> 00:17:31.132
<i>Kate? Kate?
Are you hearing us?</i>

332
00:17:32.468 --> 00:17:36.137
Shut up, shut up, shut up!
<i>Kate, are you still hearing us?</i>

333
00:17:36.638 --> 00:17:38.950
<i>Yes, Jean, I can hear you.
Everyone, move out.</i>

334
00:17:39.775 --> 00:17:41.192
<i>Get out of the way.</i>

335
00:17:41.393 --> 00:17:43.269
<i>What is that?
What is that in the water?</i>

336
00:17:43.479 --> 00:17:46.564
<i>I can't really get a good look,
but it appears there is something...</i>

337
00:17:46.732 --> 00:17:50.051
<i>I'm looking through the people, trying
to determine exactly what this is.</i>

338
00:17:50.861 --> 00:17:54.697
<i>I don't even know.
It's like shadowy figures.</i>

339
00:17:54.907 --> 00:17:58.743
<i>Maybe five, six, seven.
I can make out maybe eight figures.</i>

340
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.005
What the hell is that?
Holy shit!

341
00:18:02.414 --> 00:18:04.749
Look at that!
Stavs, you see that?

342
00:18:05.417 --> 00:18:06.472
<i>I'm gonna head back now.</i>

343
00:18:06.473 --> 00:18:09.128
<i>Everyone needs,
to get out of here right now.</i>

344
00:18:15.886 --> 00:18:19.038
<i>I think that we've gotta leave, Jean.
I'm gonna head back now.</i>

345
00:18:19.848 --> 00:18:20.990
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

346
00:18:24.686 --> 00:18:26.738
Go! Let's go.
Go, go!

347
00:18:28.089 --> 00:18:30.950
Corporal Grayston and Corporal lmlay
are both expert marksmen

348
00:18:31.118 --> 00:18:33.060
as well as strong fire team leaders.

349
00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:36.147
We also have PFC Lenihan,
who is our second best marksman

350
00:18:36.356 --> 00:18:38.366
just behind Lance Corporal Guerrero.

351
00:18:38.367 --> 00:18:39.926
What's your take on this, Specs?

352
00:18:40.953 --> 00:18:42.695
I don't know.
Extraterrestrial?

353
00:18:43.205 --> 00:18:44.847
Do you mean like from space?

354
00:18:44.848 --> 00:18:45.898
No, Imlay.

355
00:18:45.899 --> 00:18:46.756
From Canada.

356
00:18:47.057 --> 00:18:48.500
You always got jokes, don't you, Stav?

357
00:18:48.501 --> 00:18:50.270
Alright, first squad, line it up.
Bring it in. Let's go!

358
00:18:52.548 --> 00:18:53.881
As you may have heard already,

359
00:18:54.491 --> 00:18:57.143
Staff Sergeant Nantz will be
taking over for Staff Sergeant Beck.

360
00:18:57.553 --> 00:18:59.354
We're lucky to have him aboard.

361
00:19:00.264 --> 00:19:02.351
Alright.
Here's the situation, Marines.

362
00:19:02.852 --> 00:19:04.616
We're facing an unknown enemy.

363
00:19:04.685 --> 00:19:07.937
We don't know how strong their
force is or what they're capable of.

364
00:19:08.346 --> 00:19:10.069
But one thing we do know,

365
00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:11.932
is that we're fighting for our land,

366
00:19:12.042 --> 00:19:13.159
our families,

367
00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.503
our home and our country,
goddamn it!

368
00:19:15.971 --> 00:19:18.674
Whatever those things are,
let's show them how Marines fight.

369
00:19:18.675 --> 00:19:19.348
Retreat.

370
00:19:19.516 --> 00:19:20.657
Hell!
Two-Five!

371
00:19:20.825 --> 00:19:22.726
Retreat, hell!
Let's form it up, let's go!

372
00:19:34.006 --> 00:19:36.040
First in, last out, Marines!

373
00:19:37.092 --> 00:19:38.575
Breathe, Lenihan.

374
00:19:38.876 --> 00:19:40.394
Breathe. Your training will kick in.

375
00:19:40.504 --> 00:19:41.721
Thank you, staff sergeant!

376
00:19:43.432 --> 00:19:45.283
Got something to get off
your chest, corporal?

377
00:19:45.484 --> 00:19:47.251
No, it's cool, staff sergeant.

378
00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:50.204
You got a silver star, my brother
came home in a box, I get it.

379
00:19:53.025 --> 00:19:56.068
<i>All stations, this net.
Standby for sitrep.</i>

380
00:19:56.378 --> 00:19:58.671
<i>Enemy elements have advanced
beyond the beach.</i>

381
00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.010
Aliens?

382
00:20:00.711 --> 00:20:02.417
That's not possible, right?

383
00:20:03.535 --> 00:20:05.311
We'll know soon enough, brother.

384
00:20:06.246 --> 00:20:10.166
<i>One-oh-one tank has been destroyed.
Company beyond the defensive line.</i>

385
00:20:10.375 --> 00:20:14.137
It's in case his head gets blown off,
so they can identify his body.

386
00:20:16.381 --> 00:20:18.716
<i>Be advised, enemy have
heavy assault weapons.</i>

387
00:20:18.926 --> 00:20:21.194
<i>Firepower equal
to high-explosive rounds.</i>

388
00:20:24.348 --> 00:20:26.024
Hey, staff sergeant!

389
00:20:26.825 --> 00:20:28.592
Promise me you won't
let me be taken alive,

390
00:20:28.602 --> 00:20:31.446
by some godless predator
from another world, staff sergeant?

391
00:20:33.482 --> 00:20:35.500
No promises in combat.

392
00:20:36.693 --> 00:20:38.887
Stop screwing around
and keep your head in it!

393
00:20:40.364 --> 00:20:45.660
<i>These units are falling tactically.
Their strategies are coordinated.</i>

394
00:20:45.869 --> 00:20:48.955
<i>Do not underestimate enemy
combat intelligence.</i>

395
00:20:56.004 --> 00:20:58.089
<i>We are not evacuating civilians
fast enough.</i>

396
00:20:58.298 --> 00:21:00.675
<i>I say again, we are not evacuating
fast enough.</i>

397
00:21:00.884 --> 00:21:02.454
<i>All units be advised,</i>

398
00:21:03.155 --> 00:21:05.722
<i>there are friendlies
behind enemy lines.</i>

399
00:21:06.723 --> 00:21:08.866
<i>Semper Fi, 1-7 Actual, out.</i>

400
00:21:43.135 --> 00:21:45.052
You gotta take me to dinner first, baby.

401
00:21:45.053 --> 00:21:47.030
Boys, hold on to something.
Things are about to get rough.

402
00:22:31.099 --> 00:22:33.593
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Out! Go!

403
00:22:43.779 --> 00:22:45.529
Move, move, move!

404
00:22:47.691 --> 00:22:48.816
Form it up!

405
00:22:56.741 --> 00:22:57.637
What do we got, sir?

406
00:22:57.638 --> 00:22:59.743
Alright, situation is as follows.

407
00:23:00.253 --> 00:23:02.413
Most of Santa Monica's been
cleared of civilians.

408
00:23:02.422 --> 00:23:06.108
We got a defensive line at Lincoln
Boulevard a mile from the ocean.

409
00:23:06.218 --> 00:23:09.637
Air Force has got Warthogs
and B-52s on deck.

410
00:23:09.946 --> 00:23:11.798
At 1930 hours,

411
00:23:11.799 --> 00:23:15.284
they will pound the entire area
from Lincoln to the ocean.

412
00:23:16.019 --> 00:23:17.028
Shit.

413
00:23:19.564 --> 00:23:21.207
We're levelling Santa Monica, sir?

414
00:23:21.316 --> 00:23:23.667
We got an infestation
of God knows what.

415
00:23:23.777 --> 00:23:25.181
But they're not of this Earth and we

416
00:23:25.182 --> 00:23:26.737
gotta hit them
with everything we've got

417
00:23:26.947 --> 00:23:28.241
and we gotta hit them hard.

418
00:23:29.142 --> 00:23:30.599
They are a ground-force enemy only.

419
00:23:30.608 --> 00:23:33.902
They have no aircraft so the Air Force
will tear them a new asshole

420
00:23:34.312 --> 00:23:35.963
and we will rule the air.

421
00:23:36.072 --> 00:23:38.115
You said most civilians, sir?
That's affirmed.

422
00:23:38.525 --> 00:23:40.517
Getting distress calls,
sending squads out.

423
00:23:40.627 --> 00:23:43.587
Golf, you take Santa Monica to Olympic.

424
00:23:43.797 --> 00:23:45.965
Foxtrot, Olympic to Pico.

425
00:23:45.966 --> 00:23:47.842
Echo, Pico to Ocean Park.

426
00:23:47.843 --> 00:23:49.036
Lieutenant Martinez,

427
00:23:50.237 --> 00:23:51.895
I want you to break off a squad,

428
00:23:51.896 --> 00:23:52.871
and a machine gun team.

429
00:23:52.981 --> 00:23:56.600
Proceed west from Lincoln
to a police station located here,

430
00:23:56.610 --> 00:23:57.956
at Venice and Amarosa.

431
00:23:58.157 --> 00:23:59.178
Venice and Amarosa.

432
00:23:59.187 --> 00:24:00.663
Police were overrun.

433
00:24:00.772 --> 00:24:03.587
Got a distress call that civilians
are still there.

434
00:24:03.888 --> 00:24:05.234
We don't know how many.

435
00:24:05.443 --> 00:24:07.695
Just gather survivors,
then you radio in.

436
00:24:07.696 --> 00:24:10.673
We'll have helicopters
in the area to evacuate you out.

437
00:24:10.782 --> 00:24:14.318
Now be advised, you got exactly
three hours before our bombs drop.

438
00:24:14.319 --> 00:24:16.207
And make no mistake they will drop,

439
00:24:16.408 --> 00:24:18.113
with or without you.

440
00:24:18.123 --> 00:24:20.657
You get those civilians
and you get the hell out of there,

441
00:24:20.667 --> 00:24:23.961
and you kill anything
that is not human.

442
00:24:24.171 --> 00:24:25.997
Let's go!
Let's get it done!

443
00:24:26.631 --> 00:24:28.670
Captain, this is not a drill.

444
00:24:28.671 --> 00:24:30.434
You hold that line,
you understand me?

445
00:24:30.435 --> 00:24:31.435
Yes, sir.

446
00:24:40.937 --> 00:24:42.471
<i>From the coastline into suburbs.</i>

447
00:24:42.472 --> 00:24:43.856
<i>Golf company is overrun.</i>

448
00:24:43.857 --> 00:24:46.192
<i>Lima company requesting
immediate air support.</i>

449
00:24:46.401 --> 00:24:49.445
<i>Civilians are being stranded
behind enemy lines.</i>

450
00:24:49.654 --> 00:24:50.888
Hang on, One!

451
00:24:51.198 --> 00:24:52.656
Fire in the hole!

452
00:25:07.547 --> 00:25:10.799
Troops are amassing in every coast,
along every major coastline.

453
00:25:11.009 --> 00:25:12.927
The UN has called
an emergency sitting

454
00:25:13.094 --> 00:25:15.971
in an attempt to establish
a means for sharing resources

455
00:25:16.181 --> 00:25:18.098
and intelligence across the globe.

456
00:25:18.308 --> 00:25:19.534
Watch out, go!

457
00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.630
This is the way?
Where are we supposed to go?

458
00:25:25.941 --> 00:25:27.266
Jesus Christ.

459
00:25:39.537 --> 00:25:42.831
Marines, anything beyond this point,
consider to be hostile.

460
00:25:43.041 --> 00:25:44.267
Alright, nice and easy.

461
00:25:54.678 --> 00:25:55.695
Clear.

462
00:25:59.499 --> 00:26:01.275
Hell of a way to earn
your citizenship, right?

463
00:26:01.393 --> 00:26:03.719
Shit. I'd rather be in Afghanistan.

464
00:26:04.028 --> 00:26:07.306
Lieutenant, how many civilians we
gotta get out of that police station?

465
00:26:07.774 --> 00:26:10.018
I have no idea, Guerrero.
Just stay focused.

466
00:26:16.908 --> 00:26:19.618
What the hell's that? What is that?
This is insane.

467
00:26:19.828 --> 00:26:21.328
Yo, eyes open.

468
00:26:21.538 --> 00:26:24.373
<i>An unidentified enemy
has breached our coastlines</i>

469
00:26:24.882 --> 00:26:27.109
<i>in a swift and militaristic attack.</i>

470
00:26:27.419 --> 00:26:30.462
<i>At this point, there are many more
questions than answers.</i>

471
00:26:30.672 --> 00:26:34.909
<i>Right now, one thing is clear:
The world is at war.</i>

472
00:26:36.094 --> 00:26:37.594
Eyes open.

473
00:26:39.931 --> 00:26:41.574
You see something, Simmons?

474
00:26:43.101 --> 00:26:44.435
Can't see shit.

475
00:26:47.013 --> 00:26:48.543
Kerns, you see a cross street?

476
00:26:49.444 --> 00:26:50.782
Lieutenant, I don't see nothing.

477
00:26:50.942 --> 00:26:53.711
Police station's about one
klick northwest of here.

478
00:27:27.062 --> 00:27:28.938
Twelve o'clock!
Enemy straight.

479
00:27:29.647 --> 00:27:32.566
<i>This is Echo 6, we need immediate...
Turn your radios down.</i>

480
00:27:41.993 --> 00:27:42.929
It's just a dog.

481
00:27:43.354 --> 00:27:45.154
Just a little doggy.
Come here. Come here.

482
00:27:45.538 --> 00:27:47.063
It's just a dog.
Dog.

483
00:27:47.073 --> 00:27:48.198
Dog.
Dog.

484
00:27:48.508 --> 00:27:49.792
What's his name?
Glenn.

485
00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:51.086
Oh you kidding me.

486
00:27:51.087 --> 00:27:52.495
Who's the idiot naming dogs
these days?

487
00:27:53.004 --> 00:27:54.280
What do you wanna call him, Fido?

488
00:27:55.715 --> 00:27:56.807
Watch out!

489
00:28:04.015 --> 00:28:06.016
Where's it coming from?
I don't know.

490
00:28:06.226 --> 00:28:07.726
Lenihan, watch your head!

491
00:28:07.936 --> 00:28:09.003
On the roof!

492
00:28:12.482 --> 00:28:14.025
Enemy fire!
Eleven o'clock!

493
00:28:14.734 --> 00:28:17.028
They're on the roof! On the roof!
Cover him!

494
00:28:22.158 --> 00:28:24.868
Twenty-five metres!
Twenty-five metres!

495
00:28:26.287 --> 00:28:29.064
Lieutenant!
Left flank, on the roof!

496
00:28:29.416 --> 00:28:30.691
Covering, covering!

497
00:28:33.128 --> 00:28:34.491
We gotta move now!

498
00:28:34.692 --> 00:28:35.120
Lockett!

499
00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:35.917
Yes?

500
00:28:35.918 --> 00:28:37.256
Get me an exit down that alley!

501
00:28:37.565 --> 00:28:40.159
Yes, sergeant!
Kerns, Motown, let's go!

502
00:28:44.013 --> 00:28:45.431
Get up!
Come on!

503
00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:46.915
Falling back!

504
00:28:47.225 --> 00:28:48.442
Let's go, come on!

505
00:28:48.852 --> 00:28:50.736
Enemy fire!
Watch your head!

506
00:28:51.563 --> 00:28:53.355
Where'd they come from?
Fall back!

507
00:28:53.565 --> 00:28:55.607
Enemy fire, keep your head down!

508
00:28:55.817 --> 00:28:57.151
It's all over the damn place!

509
00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:58.360
What do you see?

510
00:28:58.653 --> 00:29:00.062
I don't know, man.
I don't see shit.

511
00:29:00.297 --> 00:29:02.089
What's going on?
How do we get out of here?

512
00:29:02.198 --> 00:29:04.491
Lieutenant, where's the exit?
I'm working on it!

513
00:29:04.701 --> 00:29:05.702
Shit, we're boxed in!

514
00:29:05.703 --> 00:29:07.703
I'll take a position by the wall!
Go, go!

515
00:29:07.912 --> 00:29:09.405
Move out!
Ambush!

516
00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:13.333
I don't have him!

517
00:29:13.793 --> 00:29:14.835
I'm hit!

518
00:29:16.129 --> 00:29:17.446
Cover me, Lockett!

519
00:29:28.683 --> 00:29:31.310
Man down, man down!
It burns!

520
00:29:35.064 --> 00:29:36.064
Shit!

521
00:29:37.108 --> 00:29:38.484
I got you, Guerrero!

522
00:29:42.281 --> 00:29:43.081
Hey!

523
00:29:43.646 --> 00:29:44.810
Lieutenant!

524
00:29:45.611 --> 00:29:46.776
Lieutenant!

525
00:29:53.124 --> 00:29:54.249
I've got you covered!

526
00:29:54.459 --> 00:29:55.768
We have an exit!

527
00:29:55.769 --> 00:29:57.336
Everybody, move out! Move out!

528
00:29:57.437 --> 00:29:58.478
Move, move!

529
00:29:58.546 --> 00:30:00.424
Staff sergeant, we got an exit!

530
00:30:00.425 --> 00:30:01.933
Come on, we're going!
Come on, let's go!

531
00:30:04.052 --> 00:30:05.583
Fall back, fall back!

532
00:30:09.958 --> 00:30:11.358
Fall back, fall back!

533
00:30:15.659 --> 00:30:17.459
Move! Move! Move! Move!

534
00:30:19.484 --> 00:30:21.344
Go, keep moving!
Keep moving!

535
00:30:24.781 --> 00:30:25.840
Lorenzo!

536
00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:27.358
Move! Move! Move! Move!

537
00:30:28.201 --> 00:30:30.118
Keep moving, keep moving,
keep moving!

538
00:30:30.995 --> 00:30:32.730
I can't see shit!

539
00:30:36.334 --> 00:30:38.473
Shit, shit, shit!

540
00:30:38.474 --> 00:30:39.561
Imlay!

541
00:30:39.671 --> 00:30:41.672
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

542
00:30:43.049 --> 00:30:44.466
U.S. Marines, coming in!

543
00:30:44.968 --> 00:30:46.760
U.S. Marines, anybody in here?

544
00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:49.471
Kitchen's clear!
The kitchen's clear, lieutenant!

545
00:30:49.472 --> 00:30:51.466
Get on that window!
Get on that window!

546
00:30:51.467 --> 00:30:53.634
Are we clear?
Put the wounded in the kitchen!

547
00:30:54.644 --> 00:30:56.812
Kerns, Lockett, secure the back
of this house.

548
00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:58.939
Yes, staff sergeant.
Staff sergeant, we're on it!

549
00:31:02.393 --> 00:31:03.079
Doc?

550
00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:04.811
How long till they're able to move?

551
00:31:04.879 --> 00:31:05.721
Ten minutes.

552
00:31:05.722 --> 00:31:07.206
Ten minutes, staff sergeant.
Ten minutes.

553
00:31:07.407 --> 00:31:09.600
You want me?
Come get some!

554
00:31:09.625 --> 00:31:10.409
I'm right here!

555
00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:11.768
What do we got, lmlay?

556
00:31:12.078 --> 00:31:14.288
I got nothing.
I can't see a goddamn thing.

557
00:31:14.455 --> 00:31:15.833
With this smoke, it's zero visibility.

558
00:31:15.935 --> 00:31:16.932
You're dead!

559
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.292
Stow that shit, Simmons!

560
00:31:18.759 --> 00:31:20.919
You'll get shot before
you're able to kill any of them.

561
00:31:21.087 --> 00:31:22.170
Your orders, sir?

562
00:31:23.923 --> 00:31:26.091
I led us right into that ambush.

563
00:31:26.676 --> 00:31:29.028
Mottola, anyone on command?
No, sir.

564
00:31:29.637 --> 00:31:31.366
We need to find answers to get out.

565
00:31:31.367 --> 00:31:32.574
You're in charge, sir.

566
00:31:32.999 --> 00:31:33.999
Your orders?

567
00:31:38.896 --> 00:31:40.539
Let's radio that evac to meet us.

568
00:31:41.207 --> 00:31:43.116
Civilians or no,
we gotta get these wounded out.

569
00:31:43.117 --> 00:31:44.854
Roger that.
Hey. Hey. Hey, guys, guys.

570
00:31:44.955 --> 00:31:45.877
Where's Lenihan?

571
00:31:46.278 --> 00:31:47.854
I didn't see him come in with us.
Where the hell is he?

572
00:31:47.864 --> 00:31:48.905
Lenihan?
Lenihan?

573
00:31:49.115 --> 00:31:50.532
Anybody got eyes on Lenihan?

574
00:31:50.742 --> 00:31:52.768
Lenihan!
I'll go for Lenihan, sir.

575
00:31:53.077 --> 00:31:54.668
Imlay, Harris, on me.

576
00:31:54.669 --> 00:31:55.963
Let's get this shit out of here.

577
00:31:56.372 --> 00:31:58.206
I'll package the wounded.
We'll rally on 10th Street.

578
00:31:58.207 --> 00:31:58.665
Roger that!

579
00:31:58.833 --> 00:32:00.809
Be prepared to move.
We're moving out soon.

580
00:32:02.503 --> 00:32:03.504
Shit.

581
00:32:12.472 --> 00:32:13.514
Mottorola.

582
00:32:14.599 --> 00:32:15.599
Mottorola?

583
00:32:18.269 --> 00:32:19.469
Oh, come on.

584
00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:20.796
Mottorola, you copy?

585
00:32:21.272 --> 00:32:22.356
<i>Lenihan, where are you?</i>

586
00:32:22.523 --> 00:32:23.682
Staff sergeant?

587
00:32:24.192 --> 00:32:27.703
Jesus Christ, I had to turn my radio off.
These things are everywhere.

588
00:32:28.112 --> 00:32:29.897
<i>We're coming for you.
What's your location?</i>

589
00:32:30.406 --> 00:32:33.659
I'm in the laundry room
of some apartment complex.

590
00:32:33.868 --> 00:32:35.619
It's like three storeys...

591
00:32:44.921 --> 00:32:46.134
<i>What colour is it?</i>

592
00:32:46.135 --> 00:32:47.163
<i>Lenihan?</i>

593
00:32:47.864 --> 00:32:48.916
<i>Lenihan?</i>

594
00:33:05.525 --> 00:33:06.525
Shit.

595
00:33:13.282 --> 00:33:14.327
Lenihan.

596
00:33:15.928 --> 00:33:16.928
Lenihan.

597
00:33:21.332 --> 00:33:22.333
Shit.

598
00:33:32.593 --> 00:33:33.836
So smooth.

599
00:33:35.763 --> 00:33:37.231
Smooth is fast.

600
00:33:38.433 --> 00:33:39.433
Shit.

601
00:33:46.816 --> 00:33:47.950
Oh, shit.

602
00:34:39.410 --> 00:34:41.561
Lenihan!
Lenihan, lower that weapon!

603
00:34:43.039 --> 00:34:44.873
What the hell?

604
00:34:54.091 --> 00:34:55.584
Keep on firing!

605
00:34:58.387 --> 00:35:00.305
Jesus Christ! What the shit?
What the hell is that thing?

606
00:35:00.873 --> 00:35:02.239
It's not dead.
They don't die.

607
00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:04.034
I've hit it a hundred times.
They don't die.

608
00:35:04.343 --> 00:35:05.688
You get separated from
the unit again,

609
00:35:05.989 --> 00:35:07.554
I'll find you and shoot you myself.

610
00:35:07.663 --> 00:35:10.148
Imlay, drop a grenade in that pool.
Let's move!

611
00:35:10.358 --> 00:35:12.059
Come on, I got you. I got you.

612
00:35:13.569 --> 00:35:14.703
Frag out.

613
00:35:27.166 --> 00:35:28.350
Street's clear.

614
00:35:30.336 --> 00:35:31.770
Get down, get down, get down.

615
00:35:31.963 --> 00:35:35.315
What's happening? What's going on?
Alright, we're good. Come on.

616
00:35:40.555 --> 00:35:42.998
It's Lenihan.
Yo, Lockett.

617
00:35:43.307 --> 00:35:47.061
You owe me $5 boy, I told you a virgin
ain't gonna die till he get him some.

618
00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:49.237
Move to the police station?

619
00:35:49.647 --> 00:35:52.599
Alright, let's move. Let's move.
Move it. Move it out.

620
00:36:05.872 --> 00:36:08.248
Where'd that come from?
Door's open at the bank!

621
00:36:08.457 --> 00:36:09.749
Take care of him.

622
00:36:09.959 --> 00:36:11.251
Where'd the shot come from?

623
00:36:11.961 --> 00:36:12.915
Kerns!

624
00:36:12.916 --> 00:36:14.354
Door's open on the bank! Let's move!

625
00:36:14.422 --> 00:36:16.632
Come on, let's go!
Move! Move! Move! Let's go!

626
00:36:18.342 --> 00:36:20.836
Stavrou, you got front.
Stavrou, cover front.

627
00:36:21.061 --> 00:36:22.145
Harris, cover front!

628
00:36:22.346 --> 00:36:23.964
Roof's clear, roof's clear!

629
00:36:24.432 --> 00:36:25.682
I got it.
I got it covered.

630
00:36:26.192 --> 00:36:28.693
Harris! Find me where
that shot came from, guys!

631
00:36:28.803 --> 00:36:30.687
Imlay, get eyes up on that roof, alright?

632
00:36:30.897 --> 00:36:33.289
Cover the roof!
Roof's clear! Roof's clear! Roof's clear!

633
00:36:33.399 --> 00:36:34.608
Lockett, on me!

634
00:36:34.817 --> 00:36:37.002
Did anybody even see where
that came from?

635
00:36:38.571 --> 00:36:39.613
Doc, how serious?

636
00:36:39.622 --> 00:36:41.616
Third degree thermal burns
on his neck and his face.

637
00:36:44.035 --> 00:36:45.519
You'll be surfing soon, Simmons.

638
00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:47.120
Shit.

639
00:36:51.292 --> 00:36:53.501
Hostiles, 12 o'clock!
Hostiles at 12 o'clock!

640
00:36:53.711 --> 00:36:55.395
Staff sergeant, hostiles, 12 o'clock!

641
00:36:57.131 --> 00:36:58.273
Prepare to fire!

642
00:36:59.133 --> 00:37:00.434
Hold it, hold it!

643
00:37:00.843 --> 00:37:02.185
Friendlies, sir.

644
00:37:03.429 --> 00:37:03.923
Shit.

645
00:37:04.648 --> 00:37:05.648
Friendlies.

646
00:37:06.573 --> 00:37:07.773
Let's get them in.

647
00:37:10.394 --> 00:37:11.436
Get over here.

648
00:37:15.483 --> 00:37:18.234
Move. Move to the back. Let's go.
Come on, get in there. Get in there.

649
00:37:18.611 --> 00:37:19.738
What's your unit?

650
00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:21.900
40th, lD.

651
00:37:22.531 --> 00:37:23.874
Where's the rest of your unit?

652
00:37:24.283 --> 00:37:26.160
Everyone else is either dead or missing.

653
00:37:27.536 --> 00:37:29.154
I picked up Air Force here.

654
00:37:29.664 --> 00:37:31.831
Tech Sergeant Elena Santos, Air Force.

655
00:37:32.041 --> 00:37:33.518
61st Wing,

656
00:37:33.519 --> 00:37:34.658
intel surveillance,

657
00:37:34.959 --> 00:37:36.311
recon division.

658
00:37:36.379 --> 00:37:37.531
Tech sergeant?

659
00:37:37.632 --> 00:37:38.788
What the hell are you doing here?

660
00:37:39.006 --> 00:37:42.184
We were tracking enemy transmissions
about 12 klicks south of here.

661
00:37:42.593 --> 00:37:45.111
They ambushed us like they knew
our freaking address.

662
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:47.472
I'm the only one left.

663
00:37:47.682 --> 00:37:50.859
I found these guys on the way to
the safe zone at Santa Monica Airport.

664
00:37:52.311 --> 00:37:54.237
You ready to use that weapon,
tech sergeant?

665
00:37:54.647 --> 00:37:56.350
With all due respect, staff sergeant,

666
00:37:56.494 --> 00:37:58.617
I didn't get this far off
of my good looks.

667
00:37:59.026 --> 00:38:00.802
I'm ready for payback.
Outstanding.

668
00:38:02.196 --> 00:38:05.156
Lieutenant, bird inbound,
25 minutes, sir.

669
00:38:05.366 --> 00:38:06.540
Roger that.

670
00:38:06.941 --> 00:38:08.368
Let's get to that police station.

671
00:38:08.577 --> 00:38:10.562
Alright, let's get Simmons and move.
Let's go!

672
00:38:15.084 --> 00:38:16.995
Cover our flanks, Mottorola!

673
00:38:17.296 --> 00:38:19.053
To the right, in that building!

674
00:38:19.163 --> 00:38:20.246
Watch your feet!

675
00:38:20.256 --> 00:38:21.548
There's the police station.

676
00:38:21.716 --> 00:38:23.951
Let's get those civilians
and get back to the F.O.B!

677
00:38:27.054 --> 00:38:28.730
Gotta rock, gotta rock!

678
00:38:34.812 --> 00:38:35.921
Come on, come on, come on.

679
00:38:36.931 --> 00:38:39.224
Alright, I'll stay with our wounded,
wait for the medevac.

680
00:38:39.233 --> 00:38:40.363
I'll go for civilians.
Roger that.

681
00:38:40.364 --> 00:38:42.327
Kerns, Dever, on me.

682
00:38:42.428 --> 00:38:45.271
Mags, mags. I need mags.
Alright.

683
00:38:45.689 --> 00:38:48.734
Santos, when that bird arrives,
I'll need your help on this stretcher.

684
00:38:49.827 --> 00:38:51.661
U.S. Marines!
U.S. Marines!

685
00:38:53.372 --> 00:38:54.631
Door. The door.

686
00:38:55.458 --> 00:38:56.327
Elevator right.

687
00:38:57.028 --> 00:38:58.028
Clear!
Elevator right.

688
00:38:58.961 --> 00:39:00.313
Second elevator, clear!

689
00:39:01.114 --> 00:39:02.114
No pulse.

690
00:39:03.257 --> 00:39:04.316
Door left.

691
00:39:05.726 --> 00:39:06.726
It's locked?
Door locked.

692
00:39:06.977 --> 00:39:08.169
Hey. What's your name?
Harper.

693
00:39:08.179 --> 00:39:09.743
I'm gonna need you on this stretcher.
Affirmative.

694
00:39:10.044 --> 00:39:11.114
Bird incoming, sir!

695
00:39:11.523 --> 00:39:12.172
Roger that.

696
00:39:12.273 --> 00:39:13.875
Imlay, pop smoke!

697
00:39:18.272 --> 00:39:19.331
Door locked.
Door left.

698
00:39:22.943 --> 00:39:24.027
Radios off.

699
00:39:34.914 --> 00:39:35.914
Move.

700
00:40:04.610 --> 00:40:06.645
U.S. Marines!
U.S. Marines!

701
00:40:09.106 --> 00:40:11.107
How many of you?
Five of us, three kids.

702
00:40:11.117 --> 00:40:12.159
Kerns, kids!

703
00:40:15.204 --> 00:40:16.704
Let's move!
Let's go, let's go!

704
00:40:16.914 --> 00:40:19.833
Alright, let's get ready to move!
Let's get it up!

705
00:40:22.419 --> 00:40:24.170
Here we go! Let's move!
Aye, sir!

706
00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:27.173
We got room for four and that is it!
That is it.

707
00:40:27.174 --> 00:40:29.517
Get your wounded on! Move it!
Oh, yeah, baby.

708
00:40:29.927 --> 00:40:31.895
Come on. Come on. Get up. Get up.

709
00:40:32.304 --> 00:40:33.972
Get him in. Hey, Guerrero.

710
00:40:35.616 --> 00:40:37.275
I'll work on that mix for you!

711
00:40:37.276 --> 00:40:39.204
I'm gonna need it, dude!
You're gonna be fine!

712
00:40:39.329 --> 00:40:40.529
You're gonna be fine!

713
00:40:41.564 --> 00:40:42.856
Give them hell!

714
00:40:45.067 --> 00:40:46.609
Oh, shit.
Come on, man.

715
00:40:47.486 --> 00:40:49.429
You just had to get out of the shit.

716
00:40:50.239 --> 00:40:52.031
You take care of yourself!
I will.

717
00:40:52.241 --> 00:40:53.675
I'll see you soon, partner.

718
00:40:55.319 --> 00:40:57.236
That's it.
We have civilians coming out!

719
00:40:57.246 --> 00:40:59.539
We can't take them, we got no room!
Make goddamn room!

720
00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:01.208
We can't!
Now, get back, sir!

721
00:41:01.917 --> 00:41:04.744
Fall back.
Move back, move back, move back!

722
00:41:09.833 --> 00:41:12.126
Wait! Kids! Kids!

723
00:41:26.609 --> 00:41:28.568
Get back to the police station!

724
00:41:33.741 --> 00:41:35.834
Backtrack, everybody!
Come on, back!

725
00:41:44.835 --> 00:41:47.438
They have air power.
I say enemy has air support.

726
00:41:47.463 --> 00:41:50.340
We have a bird down.
Damn it! Damn it!

727
00:41:50.549 --> 00:41:52.342
Tango's heading northeast of our grid.

728
00:41:52.551 --> 00:41:55.778
We've disengaged back into
a police station, we have civilians.

729
00:41:55.979 --> 00:41:57.631
I say again we have civilians.

730
00:41:58.140 --> 00:41:59.972
Lockett, Kerns, secure this door.

731
00:41:59.973 --> 00:42:01.476
Nothing gets in, you understand?

732
00:42:04.939 --> 00:42:05.899
We got a body.

733
00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:08.608
Do you think you could get rid of it
so the kids don't see it?

734
00:42:08.817 --> 00:42:10.568
What do you want?
Where should we go?

735
00:42:10.736 --> 00:42:11.736
Dever.

736
00:42:12.029 --> 00:42:13.438
Set up back there, ok?

737
00:42:16.242 --> 00:42:18.343
Come on, you guys.
Take the back.

738
00:42:18.953 --> 00:42:20.995
Stay away from the window, alright?

739
00:42:21.205 --> 00:42:24.099
Are there gonna be more choppers?
Did you guys call any in?

740
00:42:26.326 --> 00:42:28.081
I'm sure they're gonna come for us.

741
00:42:28.082 --> 00:42:29.279
They know where we are.

742
00:42:32.624 --> 00:42:33.550
Shit.

743
00:42:33.551 --> 00:42:35.059
You ok? You alright?
Yeah. I'm good.

744
00:42:35.127 --> 00:42:36.286
I'm good. Yeah.
You sure?

745
00:42:36.287 --> 00:42:38.507
You didn't get hit or nothing?
No, I'm good, man.

746
00:42:38.908 --> 00:42:39.939
I'm good.

747
00:42:41.633 --> 00:42:43.133
Man, they're gone.

748
00:42:43.534 --> 00:42:45.199
They're gone.
Everybody's gone.

749
00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:47.146
Lenihan, Guerrero, Grayston.

750
00:42:47.264 --> 00:42:49.098
Grayston.
Grayston had kids.

751
00:42:49.266 --> 00:42:51.142
He didn't deserve that.
He didn't deserve this shit!

752
00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:53.160
He didn't deserve to go out like that!

753
00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:54.190
Neither do you!

754
00:42:54.515 --> 00:42:55.600
You hear me?

755
00:42:55.601 --> 00:42:57.315
You're gonna make it through this!

756
00:42:58.066 --> 00:43:00.071
Alright?
You're gonna get out of here.

757
00:43:00.272 --> 00:43:01.777
You're gonna marry Cherise.

758
00:43:01.987 --> 00:43:03.646
And you're gonna be her problem
because...

759
00:43:04.047 --> 00:43:06.733
I'm done taking care of your
sorry ass, you got that?

760
00:43:10.287 --> 00:43:13.247
<i>All stations, this net.
Sitrep as follow:</i>

761
00:43:13.415 --> 00:43:16.359
<i>Enemy aircraft number four
fleets at this time.</i>

762
00:43:16.668 --> 00:43:20.004
<i>Be advised, more entering battle
space Los Angeles from ocean</i>

763
00:43:20.005 --> 00:43:22.548
<i>on bearing 2-niner-7-5-0.</i>

764
00:43:22.758 --> 00:43:24.109
They got air support too.

765
00:43:25.844 --> 00:43:27.796
Knocked our bird right out of the sky.

766
00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:31.141
So much for ruling the air.

767
00:43:33.143 --> 00:43:34.894
There's no time for that, lieutenant.

768
00:43:35.604 --> 00:43:37.138
Those bombs are gonna drop.

769
00:43:38.315 --> 00:43:39.841
And we're in the blast radius.

770
00:43:41.527 --> 00:43:43.511
Top of my goddamn class.

771
00:43:44.571 --> 00:43:46.766
And I get out in combat
in the middle of that shit?

772
00:43:46.991 --> 00:43:47.791
Goddamn it!

773
00:43:48.876 --> 00:43:50.919
I already lost four
of my goddamn men!

774
00:43:52.371 --> 00:43:53.496
Four good men.

775
00:43:53.664 --> 00:43:55.231
Who would go to hell
and back for you, sir.

776
00:44:01.046 --> 00:44:02.055
Have you?
Yes.

777
00:44:02.464 --> 00:44:04.424
You're not the first to lose men.
You won't be the last.

778
00:44:05.634 --> 00:44:06.997
Now, put that away.

779
00:44:06.998 --> 00:44:07.969
You understand me?

780
00:44:08.178 --> 00:44:10.521
Right now your men
are awaiting orders.

781
00:44:11.765 --> 00:44:14.276
Now, you can go left, you can go right.
I don't give a damn.

782
00:44:15.561 --> 00:44:16.862
Just make a decision.

783
00:44:19.231 --> 00:44:20.231
Lieutenant.

784
00:44:21.191 --> 00:44:22.593
It's a no-go on the helo, sir.

785
00:44:23.902 --> 00:44:25.578
Enemy aircraft is lighting it up.

786
00:44:25.988 --> 00:44:28.181
Command says it's like nothing
they ever seen before.

787
00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:29.941
We gotta find a way out.

788
00:44:30.450 --> 00:44:32.060
We gotta get to that F.O.B.

789
00:44:32.869 --> 00:44:33.786
You're right.

790
00:44:34.287 --> 00:44:35.446
We gotta move.

791
00:44:35.956 --> 00:44:37.436
Let's get these people safe.

792
00:44:37.837 --> 00:44:39.041
Lockett, Kerns!

793
00:44:39.251 --> 00:44:41.536
I need you to set up
an observation post on the roof.

794
00:44:42.045 --> 00:44:43.780
We're gonna move by foot,
so we gotta move fast.

795
00:44:44.548 --> 00:44:46.616
Scan for hostiles,
find the best route out of here.

796
00:44:47.384 --> 00:44:48.884
Alright, sir.

797
00:44:50.387 --> 00:44:51.429
Lieutenant.

798
00:44:56.643 --> 00:45:00.771
<i>Officials are now saying any civilian
within 10 miles of the coast</i>

799
00:45:00.981 --> 00:45:02.565
<i>should try to make their way</i>

800
00:45:02.733 --> 00:45:05.972
<i>to a military forward
operating base or F.O.B.</i>

801
00:45:06.361 --> 00:45:08.621
<i>This is the safest place
that you could be right now.</i>

802
00:45:09.031 --> 00:45:13.050
<i>Now, the military has set up a line
of defence to try to protect civilians.</i>

803
00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:16.346
Take a look at you, make sure
you're ok, alright?

804
00:45:17.456 --> 00:45:18.762
Just look at this.

805
00:45:19.163 --> 00:45:20.483
There you go.

806
00:45:21.293 --> 00:45:24.253
Water fountain is there, Mr. Rincon.
Ok, thank you.

807
00:45:24.463 --> 00:45:25.755
No problem.
Thank you.

808
00:45:29.009 --> 00:45:29.988
Joe Rincon.

809
00:45:29.989 --> 00:45:31.194
Staff Sergeant Nantz.

810
00:45:31.803 --> 00:45:32.970
This is my son, Hector.

811
00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:35.208
We all wanted to thank you for...

812
00:45:35.409 --> 00:45:36.449
coming to get us.

813
00:45:37.809 --> 00:45:38.809
Yeah.

814
00:45:39.227 --> 00:45:40.088
Hey, Hector.

815
00:45:40.089 --> 00:45:41.679
We leave no man behind.

816
00:45:43.023 --> 00:45:45.091
So you here when the police
got overrun?

817
00:45:47.527 --> 00:45:48.407
Right.

818
00:45:48.708 --> 00:45:50.664
Well, long as you're both ok.

819
00:45:53.116 --> 00:45:54.359
Hey, you alright, man?

820
00:45:55.285 --> 00:45:56.836
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm good.

821
00:45:57.245 --> 00:45:58.045
Ok.

822
00:45:59.873 --> 00:46:02.175
If you...
if you need him to do anything.

823
00:46:03.085 --> 00:46:04.060
You know.

824
00:46:04.061 --> 00:46:05.736
I'll let you know.

825
00:46:08.590 --> 00:46:09.632
Aye, sir.

826
00:46:10.592 --> 00:46:11.592
Aye.

827
00:46:12.761 --> 00:46:13.803
Thank you.

828
00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:21.394
We got two dozen hostiles,
about 300 metres out.

829
00:46:21.603 --> 00:46:24.389
Lieutenant, we got two dozen hostiles
300 metres north, over.

830
00:46:27.442 --> 00:46:29.711
It's like those things are on overwatch,
just like us.

831
00:46:31.697 --> 00:46:34.340
That one out front looks like the leader.
Now they got leadership.

832
00:46:34.908 --> 00:46:36.284
So do ants, Kerns.

833
00:46:37.285 --> 00:46:39.104
You think those things get scared too?

834
00:46:40.789 --> 00:46:44.159
Probably just like us, they're probably
just grunts that get told to go fight.

835
00:46:45.168 --> 00:46:46.014
Come on.

836
00:46:46.039 --> 00:46:49.639
Just find us a way out of here Marine,
because we're sitting ducks.

837
00:46:50.424 --> 00:46:53.067
<i>They dragged them out of the house
and they brought them out into the street</i>

838
00:46:53.135 --> 00:46:55.469
<i>put them in perfect order
before they shot them.</i>

839
00:46:55.679 --> 00:46:57.221
<i>They shot them right in the head.</i>

840
00:46:57.389 --> 00:46:59.549
<i>Chief, do we have any idea
why this is happening?</i>

841
00:47:00.058 --> 00:47:03.536
<i>Well, it's clear there has been no
attempt at any kind of communication.</i>

842
00:47:03.603 --> 00:47:05.413
<i>No demands, nothing like that.</i>

843
00:47:06.022 --> 00:47:08.607
<i>So, obviously, hey are here
for our resources.</i>

844
00:47:10.569 --> 00:47:12.019
<i>When you invade
a place for resources,</i>

845
00:47:12.287 --> 00:47:14.572
<i>you wipe out
the indigenous population.</i>

846
00:47:14.573 --> 00:47:16.615
<i>Those are the rules
of any colonisation.</i>

847
00:47:17.117 --> 00:47:20.111
<i>And right now,
we are being colonised.</i>

848
00:47:21.037 --> 00:47:22.121
Brave kids.

849
00:47:22.122 --> 00:47:23.234
They're my nieces.

850
00:47:24.035 --> 00:47:26.401
My sister and her husband
are away on vacation.

851
00:47:29.921 --> 00:47:33.700
Thing is, they live in Arizona.
I see them once or twice a year and...

852
00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:37.111
now I may be all they have left.

853
00:47:38.305 --> 00:47:39.496
You have kids?

854
00:47:39.497 --> 00:47:40.548
No.

855
00:47:41.057 --> 00:47:42.133
Neither do I.

856
00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:47.280
I used to regret that, but
maybe it was for the best.

857
00:47:47.689 --> 00:47:50.783
<i>Of course, our planet's surface
is 70 percent water.</i>

858
00:47:50.784 --> 00:47:53.452
<i>So again and I have to stress this,
without certainty</i>

859
00:47:53.361 --> 00:47:56.839
<i>the leading hypothesis remains
that their objective, their target,</i>

860
00:47:56.948 --> 00:47:57.990
<i>is our water.</i>

861
00:47:58.742 --> 00:47:59.943
Shit.

862
00:47:59.944 --> 00:48:01.552
There ain't gonna be nothing left.

863
00:48:02.996 --> 00:48:04.114
I think I got a way out of here.

864
00:48:05.215 --> 00:48:06.158
What'd you say?
Right here.

865
00:48:06.159 --> 00:48:07.583
Look. 200 metres out.

866
00:48:07.834 --> 00:48:09.508
What's right behind that backside?

867
00:48:09.809 --> 00:48:10.219
Bus.

868
00:48:10.437 --> 00:48:11.716
Lieutenant, we got a bus.

869
00:48:11.917 --> 00:48:12.980
Roger that.

870
00:48:13.089 --> 00:48:14.917
So the men on the roof saw a bus.

871
00:48:14.918 --> 00:48:16.283
They think it could be operational.

872
00:48:16.593 --> 00:48:18.286
Maybe we'd be better off on foot.

873
00:48:20.847 --> 00:48:22.556
It's miles to the forward operating base

874
00:48:22.808 --> 00:48:24.800
and those bombs are gonna
drop in a little more than an hour.

875
00:48:25.352 --> 00:48:26.352
We gotta move fast.

876
00:48:27.521 --> 00:48:28.888
Bus is a big target.

877
00:48:29.356 --> 00:48:30.606
I made the call.

878
00:48:31.608 --> 00:48:33.126
It's my responsibility.

879
00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:35.102
Stavrou, Harris.

880
00:48:35.612 --> 00:48:38.072
Lieutenant needs recon on a bus.
If it runs, get it back here.

881
00:48:38.073 --> 00:48:40.508
Hotwire? Either of you know how
to hotwire a bus?

882
00:48:40.909 --> 00:48:42.743
Stavrou can.
He's from Jersey, sir.

883
00:48:43.245 --> 00:48:44.328
Ladies first.

884
00:48:47.874 --> 00:48:49.233
Two hundred metres.

885
00:48:49.543 --> 00:48:50.842
Go down, there is the cars

886
00:48:50.843 --> 00:48:52.278
<i>burnt out, there is a pickup truck.</i>

887
00:48:52.387 --> 00:48:53.646
<i>Right back behind there.</i>

888
00:48:55.841 --> 00:48:57.193
We have a situation.

889
00:48:57.494 --> 00:48:59.184
Y'all need to follow me.

890
00:49:00.846 --> 00:49:03.289
Harris found it out here.
Y'all gotta see this thing.

891
00:49:13.775 --> 00:49:16.135
Weapon looks like it's been
surgically attached.

892
00:49:16.444 --> 00:49:18.071
Talk about commitment to cause.

893
00:49:24.953 --> 00:49:25.979
Shit.

894
00:49:28.623 --> 00:49:29.580
You gotta be kidding!

895
00:49:29.581 --> 00:49:31.017
Corporal. Corporal, hold it.

896
00:49:32.252 --> 00:49:33.837
Let me shoot this damn thing,
staff sergeant.

897
00:49:34.138 --> 00:49:35.429
That weapon's still hot.

898
00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:36.522
Let me just shoot it.

899
00:49:36.590 --> 00:49:37.598
Doc.
Yes, staff sergeant.

900
00:49:38.925 --> 00:49:40.134
Oh, Lord, have mercy.

901
00:49:41.761 --> 00:49:43.771
We need to know exactly
where to hit this thing,

902
00:49:43.772 --> 00:49:45.431
so we don't waste all our ammo.

903
00:49:47.893 --> 00:49:49.076
Maybe I can help.

904
00:49:49.686 --> 00:49:50.886
I'm a veterinarian.

905
00:50:04.034 --> 00:50:05.259
Sure you wanna do this?

906
00:50:05.911 --> 00:50:07.921
I was more sure when
I was standing over there.

907
00:50:09.456 --> 00:50:11.198
We gotta figure out
how to kill these things.

908
00:50:11.666 --> 00:50:14.019
Otherwise, we won't last another
five minutes out there, ok?

909
00:50:16.463 --> 00:50:17.622
Let's peel this back.

910
00:50:21.801 --> 00:50:23.389
Look at this,
we got a organ right here.

911
00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:24.268
Jesus Christ, look at that.

912
00:50:25.731 --> 00:50:27.106
I got another one right here.
Yeah, me too.

913
00:50:27.474 --> 00:50:29.817
Does it have some sort of
cognitive mechanism? Anything?

914
00:50:30.318 --> 00:50:33.187
There's no frontal lobe,
no temporal lobe, no parietal lobe.

915
00:50:33.439 --> 00:50:35.648
The cranial vault is unlike
anything I've ever seen.

916
00:50:35.857 --> 00:50:37.316
Oh, shit.
What?

917
00:50:37.484 --> 00:50:39.276
Shit. You see what I'm seeing?
What?

918
00:50:39.277 --> 00:50:41.328
The ones that were just on
the roof aren't on the roof right now.

919
00:50:41.329 --> 00:50:43.139
There's about two dozen
coming out the door, man.

920
00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:45.824
They're on the street
and heading this way.

921
00:50:45.992 --> 00:50:47.594
Lieutenant, we got movement up here.

922
00:50:47.595 --> 00:50:48.595
<i>Roger that.</i>

923
00:50:48.662 --> 00:50:51.146
We have contact 300 metres out.
We gotta cut quick.

924
00:50:58.797 --> 00:51:00.673
<i>Lieutenant, we gotta move!
What do we do?</i>

925
00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:02.396
Shit's hitting the fan.
We gotta move.

926
00:51:02.597 --> 00:51:03.342
Staff sergeant.

927
00:51:03.551 --> 00:51:04.961
Come on, how do you kill this thing?

928
00:51:14.521 --> 00:51:16.005
Goddamn it, Stavs.

929
00:51:16.439 --> 00:51:18.524
I lost them.
You lost them?

930
00:51:19.234 --> 00:51:21.061
Lieutenant, they're gone.
Lieutenant, I don't see anything.

931
00:51:23.571 --> 00:51:24.572
We got a breach.

932
00:51:24.573 --> 00:51:26.307
<i>Lieutenant, we've got a
breach on the north entrance!</i>

933
00:51:26.316 --> 00:51:27.400
They're inside the building.

934
00:51:27.867 --> 00:51:29.061
I'm gonna gather
everyone by the doors

935
00:51:29.062 --> 00:51:30.285
on the south side of the building, ok.

936
00:51:30.453 --> 00:51:31.537
We're right behind you.

937
00:51:32.247 --> 00:51:33.747
What was that?

938
00:51:33.957 --> 00:51:34.980
Adukwu, you go with her.

939
00:51:34.981 --> 00:51:36.075
Yes, staff sergeant.

940
00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:38.595
Imlay, you've got an HE grenade round?

941
00:51:38.596 --> 00:51:39.753
You never leave home without it,
staff seargeant.

942
00:51:39.963 --> 00:51:41.176
You cover that hall to the rear.

943
00:51:41.177 --> 00:51:42.239
Buy me some time.

944
00:51:42.549 --> 00:51:44.659
They start coming,
you blast the hell out of them.

945
00:51:45.635 --> 00:51:47.686
Hey, Harris.
Where's that goddamn bus?

946
00:51:48.096 --> 00:51:50.773
Stavs. Stavs, we got an enemy scout.
Come on, let's go.

947
00:51:52.809 --> 00:51:56.470
Yes! Yes! Yeah, baby!
Newark! Represent!

948
00:51:56.980 --> 00:51:59.189
<i>Lieutenant, we've got the bus,
heading back.</i>

949
00:51:59.399 --> 00:52:01.692
Ok, guys, the bus is en route!
Bus is en route! Guys.

950
00:52:01.901 --> 00:52:03.361
Thirty seconds till we move out!

951
00:52:10.285 --> 00:52:12.811
<i>Imlay, give me a sitrep.
I need an update on the breach.</i>

952
00:52:13.079 --> 00:52:14.397
<i>Report back, over.</i>

953
00:52:20.879 --> 00:52:22.254
We're running out of time.

954
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:33.390
Move!

955
00:52:37.604 --> 00:52:38.754
Contact!

956
00:52:40.398 --> 00:52:41.599
They've breached.

957
00:52:47.322 --> 00:52:48.505
This is our last shot.

958
00:52:49.199 --> 00:52:50.241
Got it.

959
00:52:51.326 --> 00:52:52.510
Right here.

960
00:52:59.167 --> 00:53:00.489
That's gotta be it.

961
00:53:00.990 --> 00:53:02.203
It's dying.

962
00:53:07.133 --> 00:53:08.783
That's how we kill this thing,

963
00:53:08.784 --> 00:53:10.469
to the right of where
the heart would be.

964
00:53:10.637 --> 00:53:12.212
Got it.
I got three more!

965
00:53:16.518 --> 00:53:17.743
Let's get out of here.

966
00:53:21.648 --> 00:53:23.950
Get move! Get move!
Get them on the bus!

967
00:53:24.275 --> 00:53:25.475
Let's go, let's go!

968
00:53:30.365 --> 00:53:32.099
Get on.
Get underneath.

969
00:53:33.527 --> 00:53:34.310
You ok?

970
00:53:38.832 --> 00:53:41.629
Heads up. Cover your sectors of fire.

971
00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:42.676
Heads up!

972
00:53:46.464 --> 00:53:47.243
Marines,

973
00:53:47.644 --> 00:53:50.817
concentrate firepower to the right
of where the heart would be.

974
00:53:50.885 --> 00:53:52.102
Yes, staff sergeant.

975
00:53:53.221 --> 00:53:54.721
That's how we kill these things.

976
00:53:56.683 --> 00:53:58.208
Alright, remember your training.

977
00:53:58.476 --> 00:54:00.561
We got a hostile warbird,
thousand metres out.

978
00:54:00.728 --> 00:54:02.062
Everybody keep your eyes up.

979
00:54:10.446 --> 00:54:12.164
All buckled up back there, lieutenant.

980
00:54:12.574 --> 00:54:13.591
Roger that.

981
00:54:14.450 --> 00:54:16.627
It should be about six miles to the F.O.B.

982
00:54:17.537 --> 00:54:19.313
I don't know, 25, 30 minutes.

983
00:54:19.789 --> 00:54:21.423
If we stay on these side streets.

984
00:54:21.833 --> 00:54:24.285
Air Force is gonna level this area
in 40 minutes.

985
00:54:30.842 --> 00:54:32.540
Get us to the forward operating base.

986
00:54:32.641 --> 00:54:33.678
Fast.

987
00:54:48.693 --> 00:54:50.185
What the hell is that?

988
00:54:51.362 --> 00:54:52.571
Stavrou, stop the bus.

989
00:55:08.713 --> 00:55:09.838
Everyone, get down.

990
00:55:25.647 --> 00:55:28.523
Any station, this is Foxtrot-
Two-November. Sitrep to follow.

991
00:55:28.733 --> 00:55:30.476
<i>Go ahead, Foxtrot-Two-November.</i>

992
00:55:30.985 --> 00:55:33.037
Enemy aircraft.
They're lighting up the sky

993
00:55:33.038 --> 00:55:35.873
heading east towards
downtown Los Angeles.

994
00:55:35.982 --> 00:55:37.107
<i>Copy that.</i>

995
00:55:40.203 --> 00:55:41.436
They're tracking our signals.

996
00:55:45.208 --> 00:55:47.418
Mottola, turn off that radio!
They're tracking our signals!

997
00:55:47.419 --> 00:55:48.126
Turn it off.

998
00:55:48.127 --> 00:55:50.379
All radios off!
Cell phones, everything!

999
00:55:52.257 --> 00:55:53.324
Give me your radio.

1000
00:55:57.637 --> 00:55:58.838
Mottola.
Give me your radio.

1001
00:56:03.142 --> 00:56:04.184
Where you going?

1002
00:56:04.352 --> 00:56:05.820
Staff sergeant!
Where the hell is he going?

1003
00:56:15.113 --> 00:56:16.710
We gotta get off this bus, alright?

1004
00:56:17.011 --> 00:56:19.225
Ten o'clock, lieutenant, 10 o'clock!

1005
00:56:20.034 --> 00:56:22.461
I see it, 8 o'clock, heading south!

1006
00:56:23.371 --> 00:56:24.382
It's getting closer.

1007
00:56:24.783 --> 00:56:26.198
Hey, it's on my six!

1008
00:56:33.631 --> 00:56:34.682
A hundred metres!

1009
00:56:42.765 --> 00:56:43.774
Oh, my God.

1010
00:56:46.728 --> 00:56:48.520
Everybody, get down!

1011
00:57:02.327 --> 00:57:03.544
Holy shit.

1012
00:57:43.659 --> 00:57:45.619
What was that?
Is he alright?

1013
00:57:45.828 --> 00:57:47.788
Did he make it out?
Staff sergeant?

1014
00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:05.776
There he is.

1015
00:58:05.777 --> 00:58:07.516
Staff sergeant's alive!

1016
00:58:07.725 --> 00:58:09.551
Yeah, he's alive!
There he is!

1017
00:58:44.178 --> 00:58:46.038
That aircraft was unmanned, lieutenant.

1018
00:58:47.432 --> 00:58:48.574
Drone.

1019
00:58:56.357 --> 00:58:58.617
That was some real John Wayne shit,
staff sergeant.

1020
00:59:07.493 --> 00:59:08.452
Hey.

1021
00:59:10.204 --> 00:59:12.765
I can't afford to lose you.
Neither can these men, alright?

1022
00:59:14.876 --> 00:59:16.210
Yeah.
They're your men.

1023
00:59:19.547 --> 00:59:21.073
Alright, staff sergeant!

1024
00:59:24.510 --> 00:59:26.094
That's how you do it!

1025
00:59:26.304 --> 00:59:28.072
That's retreat, hell!
That's right.

1026
00:59:28.890 --> 00:59:30.649
Who the hell's John Wayne?

1027
00:59:42.069 --> 00:59:43.553
Everybody, eyes open!

1028
00:59:43.863 --> 00:59:45.130
Stay alert!

1029
00:59:46.532 --> 00:59:47.908
Thank you for that.

1030
00:59:52.872 --> 00:59:53.972
It's nothing.

1031
00:59:55.708 --> 00:59:57.584
What's that mean, retreat, hell?

1032
01:00:01.547 --> 01:00:02.911
During World War I,

1033
01:00:03.412 --> 01:00:05.476
an officer from our regiment
was ordered to retreat.

1034
01:00:06.385 --> 01:00:07.495
He said,

1035
01:00:07.796 --> 01:00:08.886
Retreat, hell.

1036
01:00:09.287 --> 01:00:10.497
We just got here.

1037
01:00:15.144 --> 01:00:17.104
You should have the doc
take a look at that.

1038
01:00:18.356 --> 01:00:19.756
I thought you were a doctor.

1039
01:00:20.483 --> 01:00:22.126
Animals and aliens only.

1040
01:00:23.694 --> 01:00:25.262
I'll put it on my to-do list.

1041
01:00:26.572 --> 01:00:27.572
Thank you.

1042
01:00:38.042 --> 01:00:39.705
Excuse me, staff sergeant.

1043
01:00:39.906 --> 01:00:41.378
Did you say that was
an unmanned drone?

1044
01:00:41.379 --> 01:00:42.454
Correct.

1045
01:00:43.598 --> 01:00:45.575
They must have one hell
of a command and control system.

1046
01:00:47.385 --> 01:00:49.728
If NORTHCOM didn't agree with you,
I wouldn't be here.

1047
01:00:50.137 --> 01:00:51.137
Why?

1048
01:00:52.890 --> 01:00:54.874
My mission was to provide AIS,

1049
01:00:55.275 --> 01:00:56.610
with a strike package.

1050
01:00:57.144 --> 01:00:58.462
A strike package?

1051
01:00:58.771 --> 01:01:02.182
Yeah, coordinates for a missile strike
on a command and control centre.

1052
01:01:02.692 --> 01:01:04.132
But the asset fell off the grid,

1053
01:01:05.033 --> 01:01:06.311
and we lost them.

1054
01:01:16.539 --> 01:01:17.983
All side streets are blocked.

1055
01:01:18.284 --> 01:01:20.100
Our only choice is to take
the freeway.

1056
01:01:21.085 --> 01:01:22.820
Alright.
Well, it's your call.

1057
01:01:23.629 --> 01:01:25.438
Stavrou, get us on a freeway.

1058
01:01:26.507 --> 01:01:28.260
We don't wanna be in this area,

1059
01:01:28.261 --> 01:01:29.685
when these bombs start to fall.

1060
01:01:53.993 --> 01:01:55.844
Try to miss at least one
of the cars, Stavrou.

1061
01:01:58.122 --> 01:01:59.306
Just keep driving.

1062
01:02:00.666 --> 01:02:02.150
Off ramp is one mile ahead.

1063
01:02:09.133 --> 01:02:10.133
Jesus.

1064
01:02:11.552 --> 01:02:12.552
Look out.

1065
01:02:19.101 --> 01:02:20.054
The ramp,

1066
01:02:20.855 --> 01:02:22.162
it's gone, lieutenant.

1067
01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:28.585
Alright,

1068
01:02:28.986 --> 01:02:30.929
Robertson exit, half a click away.

1069
01:02:32.823 --> 01:02:34.532
Look out!
Incoming, 12 o'clock!

1070
01:02:43.751 --> 01:02:45.427
You ok?
Harper!

1071
01:02:53.219 --> 01:02:55.645
Tank's drawing enemy fire!
It's a good time to move!

1072
01:02:55.855 --> 01:02:58.106
I'll suppress the fire in front,
you just take the civilians out the back!

1073
01:02:58.516 --> 01:02:59.917
Secure this exit, Imlay!

1074
01:03:04.146 --> 01:03:06.690
Imlay, get me a defensive line
on that vehicle!

1075
01:03:10.403 --> 01:03:12.454
Move, move, move, move!
Let's go! Come on.

1076
01:03:13.364 --> 01:03:15.507
Let's go!
Come on, stay down, stay down!

1077
01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:22.564
Just keep everybody calm.

1078
01:03:22.565 --> 01:03:24.124
We'll be right back, alright?

1079
01:03:24.333 --> 01:03:25.942
Alright.
Safety first, buddy.

1080
01:03:29.296 --> 01:03:30.349
Lieutenant Martinez,

1081
01:03:30.650 --> 01:03:32.519
if we get the civilians to that helo,

1082
01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:34.234
they take cover, rappel down.

1083
01:03:34.343 --> 01:03:36.595
I got a dozen up on the bridge.
They're moving down.

1084
01:03:37.346 --> 01:03:40.682
Lieutenant! Tank's out!
Nothing's stopping them now!

1085
01:03:43.602 --> 01:03:46.439
Staff sergeant, civilians won't make
it to that helo without cover fire.

1086
01:03:48.482 --> 01:03:50.025
Lockett, Kerns, on me, let's go!

1087
01:03:50.026 --> 01:03:52.644
Let's move, let's move, let's move!

1088
01:03:57.366 --> 01:03:59.242
Get the civilians down, alright?
Move!

1089
01:04:09.462 --> 01:04:10.962
About a 30-foot drop.
Come on come on. Let's go.

1090
01:04:11.172 --> 01:04:12.369
Get behind the bus!

1091
01:04:12.370 --> 01:04:14.733
Now, now, now, now, now, now!
Get behind it!

1092
01:04:16.093 --> 01:04:19.012
Kids first! Around the body, bring them
down one at a time, do you copy?

1093
01:04:19.221 --> 01:04:20.221
Roger that.

1094
01:04:22.308 --> 01:04:23.308
Imlay!

1095
01:04:24.143 --> 01:04:25.744
Get your first team up
on that garbage truck.

1096
01:04:26.345 --> 01:04:28.145
Move!
Staff sergeant, cover us up front!

1097
01:04:28.146 --> 01:04:29.840
Stavs, you're with me!
On me now!

1098
01:04:32.234 --> 01:04:34.687
We're gonna run behind that helicopter
and we're gonna rope down, alright?

1099
01:04:34.788 --> 01:04:35.890
Do you understand?
Yeah.

1100
01:04:36.083 --> 01:04:37.330
Again, the girls will be first.

1101
01:04:37.331 --> 01:04:39.000
I promise you nothing's gonna
happen, ok?

1102
01:04:39.425 --> 01:04:40.825
Stay down!

1103
01:04:43.078 --> 01:04:45.605
Lieutenant, dozen hostiles,
maybe more!

1104
01:04:45.873 --> 01:04:48.416
Four hundred metres
and closing fast!

1105
01:04:48.918 --> 01:04:51.336
Cover, cover!
What the hell are you doing?

1106
01:04:51.545 --> 01:04:53.129
You guys need another gun.

1107
01:04:54.298 --> 01:04:55.391
Three o'clock. Come on.

1108
01:04:55.716 --> 01:04:57.300
Up on the bridge, Santos.
Up on the bridge.

1109
01:04:57.301 --> 01:04:59.093
Incoming!

1110
01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:07.686
Ten o'clock!

1111
01:05:13.275 --> 01:05:14.519
Reloading!

1112
01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:15.843
Aim for the leader!

1113
01:05:20.024 --> 01:05:21.666
Hell, you can take all
the room you want.

1114
01:05:22.243 --> 01:05:24.613
Mottola, move, move, move, move,
move, move!

1115
01:05:24.614 --> 01:05:26.013
Yes, staff sergeant! Come on!

1116
01:05:26.014 --> 01:05:27.570
Let's go! Let's go, go, go, go, go!

1117
01:05:27.871 --> 01:05:29.065
Run now, run!

1118
01:05:29.375 --> 01:05:30.461
Keep running!

1119
01:05:31.086 --> 01:05:33.086
Don't stop, run!
Run, run, run!

1120
01:05:39.844 --> 01:05:40.583
Get in there!

1121
01:05:41.384 --> 01:05:42.395
Cover me!

1122
01:05:44.014 --> 01:05:45.599
I'm going for the 50 cal!

1123
01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:47.100
Hurry up!

1124
01:05:52.857 --> 01:05:53.924
Get some, Lockett.

1125
01:06:05.953 --> 01:06:07.023
Shit.

1126
01:06:07.024 --> 01:06:08.162
What the hell is that thing?

1127
01:06:08.372 --> 01:06:09.414
I'm engaging!

1128
01:06:13.294 --> 01:06:14.473
You'll be ok, alright?

1129
01:06:14.874 --> 01:06:15.874
It's ok.

1130
01:06:16.038 --> 01:06:17.222
Listen to me.
You're going to be ok.

1131
01:06:17.423 --> 01:06:19.683
I got you. I will not let anything
happen to you, alright?

1132
01:06:26.724 --> 01:06:27.724
Shit!

1133
01:06:29.643 --> 01:06:30.877
Man down!

1134
01:06:31.896 --> 01:06:34.348
You're gonna be ok. Hold on.
Hold on! Keep going. Hold on!

1135
01:06:35.524 --> 01:06:36.733
Keep looking up!

1136
01:06:44.867 --> 01:06:45.967
Oh, God!

1137
01:06:46.619 --> 01:06:48.311
I got you.
It's ok. It's ok.

1138
01:06:48.621 --> 01:06:50.797
Get the ant that's controlling that thing!

1139
01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:56.036
Lockett, get off your ass!

1140
01:07:02.551 --> 01:07:03.801
It's turning this way!

1141
01:07:04.011 --> 01:07:06.430
It's about to hit the fan, guys.
Get out now! Move!

1142
01:07:07.139 --> 01:07:08.765
Santos, come on!

1143
01:07:09.642 --> 01:07:11.184
Come on!
I'm stuck.

1144
01:07:11.393 --> 01:07:12.685
Go!

1145
01:07:13.896 --> 01:07:15.730
What are you doing?
Go!

1146
01:07:17.316 --> 01:07:18.816
Imlay!

1147
01:07:30.204 --> 01:07:31.454
Where's Stavrou?

1148
01:07:36.377 --> 01:07:37.877
Mottorola!
How many down?

1149
01:07:39.588 --> 01:07:41.990
Two down, staff sarge!
One to go!

1150
01:07:42.299 --> 01:07:44.617
Look at me, look at me. Look, look.
Be good, ok?

1151
01:07:44.927 --> 01:07:46.076
It's gonna be fine, ok.
You ready?

1152
01:07:46.077 --> 01:07:46.656
Go down.

1153
01:07:46.657 --> 01:07:48.321
Lieutenant, C-4!

1154
01:07:51.058 --> 01:07:52.684
Let's blow this sucker to hell!

1155
01:07:52.685 --> 01:07:54.410
Alright.

1156
01:07:54.411 --> 01:07:55.186
Let's do it.

1157
01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:57.480
Kerns!

1158
01:08:04.238 --> 01:08:05.422
Covering!

1159
01:08:17.584 --> 01:08:19.043
Alright, dough is good to go!

1160
01:08:19.253 --> 01:08:21.045
Go!
Covering!

1161
01:08:26.427 --> 01:08:28.486
Damn it!
We've lost the detonator.

1162
01:08:29.972 --> 01:08:30.667
You alright?

1163
01:08:30.668 --> 01:08:32.799
Yeah, got the wind knocked out of me.

1164
01:08:39.982 --> 01:08:40.982
Dad!
Mottorola!

1165
01:08:40.983 --> 01:08:41.625
Dad!

1166
01:08:42.026 --> 01:08:43.901
You're ok, Hector! You're ok.

1167
01:08:44.069 --> 01:08:45.086
Hold on!

1168
01:08:48.991 --> 01:08:50.567
I need bandages from the first aid kit.

1169
01:08:50.570 --> 01:08:52.109
Sir! Sir!

1170
01:08:52.119 --> 01:08:53.236
It's ok!

1171
01:09:00.794 --> 01:09:01.920
Oh, my God!

1172
01:09:03.297 --> 01:09:04.197
Alright.

1173
01:09:19.813 --> 01:09:21.273
We gotta get you to a medevac.

1174
01:09:21.982 --> 01:09:23.083
Doc!

1175
01:09:27.854 --> 01:09:28.996
Oh, shit, man!

1176
01:09:29.164 --> 01:09:30.615
We need some cover!
Damn it, I'm out!

1177
01:09:30.783 --> 01:09:33.076
Got another mag, Lockett?
They kicking our ass!

1178
01:09:33.243 --> 01:09:34.978
You're getting pinned down,
staff sergeant!

1179
01:09:35.788 --> 01:09:37.481
Marines, you're getting pinned down!

1180
01:09:38.874 --> 01:09:39.933
We're not leaving you, lieutenant.

1181
01:09:39.934 --> 01:09:41.375
Staff sergeant, you gotta get
them out of here!

1182
01:09:41.585 --> 01:09:43.628
Lieutenant, I am not leav...
You gotta get them out of here!

1183
01:09:43.837 --> 01:09:45.580
No, I'm not leaving you!
You gotta get them out of here!

1184
01:09:45.581 --> 01:09:46.831
No!
Not again!

1185
01:09:50.302 --> 01:09:52.270
I have a bag of C-4 on the bus.

1186
01:09:53.931 --> 01:09:55.173
Give this to my wife,

1187
01:09:56.183 --> 01:09:58.493
and get them off
this goddamn freeway.

1188
01:10:02.689 --> 01:10:03.890
That's an order.

1189
01:10:07.402 --> 01:10:08.486
Yes, sir.

1190
01:10:12.116 --> 01:10:13.783
Right behind you.

1191
01:10:22.042 --> 01:10:23.292
Cover the lieutenant!

1192
01:10:26.505 --> 01:10:27.672
Hey, I'm out!

1193
01:10:33.762 --> 01:10:35.329
They're closing in!

1194
01:10:39.226 --> 01:10:40.209
Here we go.

1195
01:10:46.316 --> 01:10:48.151
This is Lieutenant William Martinez

1196
01:10:48.152 --> 01:10:51.275
Echo Company, 2nd Battalion,
5th Marines.

1197
01:10:51.276 --> 01:10:52.363
Hoorah!

1198
01:11:56.929 --> 01:11:59.272
We're still half a klick
inside the bombing zone.

1199
01:12:02.392 --> 01:12:03.718
Move to live, Marines.

1200
01:12:08.899 --> 01:12:11.226
Did he just leave the lieutenant
back there to die?

1201
01:12:12.236 --> 01:12:13.903
Sure looked that way.

1202
01:12:14.112 --> 01:12:16.097
And this is the guy in charge
of us now?

1203
01:12:17.366 --> 01:12:18.366
Let's move.

1204
01:12:21.912 --> 01:12:23.125
Hey, those are our jets.

1205
01:12:24.326 --> 01:12:25.507
We're still in the fight.

1206
01:12:27.834 --> 01:12:30.103
Alright, we're clear of the bomb zone.

1207
01:12:31.004 --> 01:12:32.488
Let's tighten this place down.

1208
01:12:32.798 --> 01:12:34.165
Bombs drop in six minutes.

1209
01:12:34.675 --> 01:12:36.434
Santos, Kerns, on me.

1210
01:12:36.843 --> 01:12:38.424
Let's see if there are any comms.

1211
01:12:38.825 --> 01:12:39.621
Alright?

1212
01:12:39.622 --> 01:12:40.796
Hardwire only.

1213
01:12:59.908 --> 01:13:01.951
Corporal Harris, we clear?
Yeah, we're clear!

1214
01:13:02.260 --> 01:13:03.557
Do you have a hard line in here?

1215
01:13:03.758 --> 01:13:04.762
Over there.

1216
01:13:09.459 --> 01:13:11.127
Now, my son's an optimist.

1217
01:13:12.129 --> 01:13:13.893
When this first happened, he said.

1218
01:13:14.294 --> 01:13:16.365
Why don't we go try to talk to them?

1219
01:13:17.801 --> 01:13:19.244
Maybe they wanna be friends.

1220
01:13:22.931 --> 01:13:23.743
Hector?

1221
01:13:24.344 --> 01:13:24.765
Hey.

1222
01:13:24.975 --> 01:13:27.102
We're gonna go get some food
and water for your dad, ok?

1223
01:13:28.770 --> 01:13:29.771
It's ok.

1224
01:13:31.231 --> 01:13:32.406
And what'd you tell him?

1225
01:13:32.816 --> 01:13:34.058
I said.

1226
01:13:34.985 --> 01:13:37.045
You know, if they're chasing
and shooting us,

1227
01:13:37.654 --> 01:13:39.831
they're probably not good friends.

1228
01:13:43.577 --> 01:13:46.220
I should've followed directions
and gone to the F.O.B.

1229
01:13:46.830 --> 01:13:49.791
I should've never stayed at the police
station, but I was scared, man.

1230
01:13:52.544 --> 01:13:54.187
I made all the wrong decisions.

1231
01:13:54.796 --> 01:13:56.348
You trusted your gut, Mr. Rincon.

1232
01:13:58.300 --> 01:13:59.834
You made a call.

1233
01:14:00.302 --> 01:14:02.295
I'd do the same thing
to protect my Marines.

1234
01:14:09.144 --> 01:14:11.168
I had a situation my last tour.

1235
01:14:11.569 --> 01:14:12.569
Yeah?

1236
01:14:13.648 --> 01:14:14.620
There was no right call.

1237
01:14:14.621 --> 01:14:16.726
You went left or you go right,
it didn't matter.

1238
01:14:20.405 --> 01:14:21.589
But you're alive.

1239
01:14:22.199 --> 01:14:23.533
Yeah, I survived.

1240
01:14:26.328 --> 01:14:27.937
But I wasn't supposed to.

1241
01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:31.858
Staff Sergeant Nantz.

1242
01:14:41.343 --> 01:14:43.052
You promise to save my son?

1243
01:14:51.186 --> 01:14:53.805
Staff sergeant, we have
a hardwired connection!

1244
01:14:56.608 --> 01:14:58.710
Doc, keep him warm.
Sun is going down.

1245
01:15:00.612 --> 01:15:01.963
This will keep you warm.

1246
01:15:02.781 --> 01:15:07.076
<i>We're estimating that 20 cities in 17
countries are now under full attack.</i>

1247
01:15:07.411 --> 01:15:11.122
<i>It's obvious the enemy is attempting
to cut us off from one another.</i>

1248
01:15:11.331 --> 01:15:14.542
<i>Is there any more information
at this time, Professor Stavert?</i>

1249
01:15:14.751 --> 01:15:17.545
<i>New data shows that they're using
our water as their fuel</i>

1250
01:15:17.712 --> 01:15:19.880
<i>and our ocean levels are
already decreasing.</i>

1251
01:15:20.090 --> 01:15:23.008
<i>They are using it to power their ships,
their machinery</i>

1252
01:15:23.009 --> 01:15:24.572
<i>possibly their own bodies.</i>

1253
01:15:24.673 --> 01:15:27.079
<i>It's the composition
of our water that's unique.</i>

1254
01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:30.566
<i>It's in a liquid state.
No other locations in our known universe</i>

1255
01:15:30.567 --> 01:15:31.803
<i>have liquid H2O</i>

1256
01:15:31.804 --> 01:15:33.302
<i>anywhere near their surface.</i>

1257
01:15:33.512 --> 01:15:36.840
<i>I just saw a field report that said
they will use our sewage systems</i>

1258
01:15:37.049 --> 01:15:39.303
<i>to follow our water back
to their ships.</i>

1259
01:15:39.704 --> 01:15:40.826
How'd you get that to work?

1260
01:15:41.194 --> 01:15:42.601
These things are everywhere.

1261
01:15:42.602 --> 01:15:45.039
There's one off the coast
of 20 countries.

1262
01:15:45.249 --> 01:15:47.175
They're calling it
the command and control centre.

1263
01:15:49.202 --> 01:15:50.535
That's the thing you were tracking?

1264
01:15:50.936 --> 01:15:51.754
Yeah.

1265
01:15:52.164 --> 01:15:53.267
So you're saying,

1266
01:15:53.668 --> 01:15:55.658
that's the thing that's
controlling the drones?

1267
01:15:56.168 --> 01:15:56.938
Yeah.

1268
01:15:57.139 --> 01:15:58.241
And if we wipe it out,

1269
01:15:58.642 --> 01:16:00.096
we take out their air power.

1270
01:16:03.467 --> 01:16:04.959
These bombs better work.

1271
01:16:05.469 --> 01:16:06.593
Let's move it. Come on. Come on.

1272
01:16:06.594 --> 01:16:07.720
Bring him through here.

1273
01:16:07.721 --> 01:16:08.697
Set him down.

1274
01:16:08.998 --> 01:16:10.073
How much time we got?

1275
01:16:11.766 --> 01:16:12.766
One minute.

1276
01:16:16.021 --> 01:16:19.298
Air Force about to lay some pain
on those extraterritorial bastards.

1277
01:16:22.486 --> 01:16:24.695
Alright, Two-Five, retreat.
Hell!

1278
01:16:24.905 --> 01:16:26.022
Retreat.
Hell!

1279
01:16:28.366 --> 01:16:29.366
Here we go.

1280
01:16:29.534 --> 01:16:31.794
Come on.
Let's fry these sons of bitches.

1281
01:16:32.204 --> 01:16:34.847
We get to the F.O.B. after
these bombs drop, get some ammo.

1282
01:16:34.915 --> 01:16:36.456
And some goddamn reinforcements.

1283
01:16:36.457 --> 01:16:37.667
Some goddamn tanks.

1284
01:16:43.256 --> 01:16:44.098
Ten.

1285
01:16:44.099 --> 01:16:45.174
Gotta be strong, ok?

1286
01:16:45.383 --> 01:16:46.342
Nine.

1287
01:16:47.052 --> 01:16:48.019
Eight.

1288
01:16:48.929 --> 01:16:49.921
Seven.

1289
01:16:50.430 --> 01:16:51.372
Six.

1290
01:16:52.182 --> 01:16:53.157
Five.

1291
01:16:54.142 --> 01:16:55.059
Four.

1292
01:16:56.603 --> 01:16:57.578
Three.

1293
01:16:59.147 --> 01:17:00.565
Shit.
Everybody, brace!

1294
01:17:22.128 --> 01:17:24.004
Hey! They should've dropped.
What the hell?

1295
01:17:24.214 --> 01:17:25.582
Wouldn't we have felt that
from here if they'd dropped?

1296
01:17:25.583 --> 01:17:27.760
If they'd dropped by now,
we would've felt them here.

1297
01:17:27.770 --> 01:17:30.302
Would've felt it in goddamn Nevada
with that much ordnance.

1298
01:17:30.512 --> 01:17:31.512
That clock right?

1299
01:17:32.222 --> 01:17:33.372
That's what I got.

1300
01:17:33.682 --> 01:17:35.853
Maybe it's a good thing, right?
Maybe we turned the tide.

1301
01:17:35.854 --> 01:17:36.976
I mean, that's a good thing, right.

1302
01:17:37.143 --> 01:17:39.562
You damn straight, Imlay.
We was kicking some ass out there.

1303
01:17:39.771 --> 01:17:41.739
Could they have taken out
the whole Air Force?

1304
01:17:42.649 --> 01:17:43.958
This isn't happening.

1305
01:17:44.768 --> 01:17:45.893
Let's move.

1306
01:17:45.902 --> 01:17:47.187
Everybody, up, up.
Let's move. Come on.

1307
01:17:48.196 --> 01:17:50.431
We're in the home stretch, everybody.
We in the home stretch.

1308
01:18:09.009 --> 01:18:10.835
Now we know why
those bombs didn't drop.

1309
01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:14.756
They wiped our forward
operating base right off the map.

1310
01:18:17.309 --> 01:18:18.918
All clear, staff sergeant!

1311
01:18:19.769 --> 01:18:21.779
Alright, let's bring him back here.

1312
01:18:26.693 --> 01:18:27.735
Hang in there, buddy.

1313
01:18:27.944 --> 01:18:30.529
Million-and-one odds
we'd get here in the first place

1314
01:18:30.530 --> 01:18:31.963
we get here and there ain't nothing.

1315
01:18:32.364 --> 01:18:34.292
I knew Nantz would never get us out.

1316
01:18:37.037 --> 01:18:38.573
There were thousands of Marines here.

1317
01:18:38.574 --> 01:18:40.340
Now it's just seven of us, Imlay.

1318
01:18:42.792 --> 01:18:44.685
You remind me of my older brother.

1319
01:18:45.879 --> 01:18:47.071
How's that?

1320
01:18:48.340 --> 01:18:49.816
He never smiles either.

1321
01:18:54.179 --> 01:18:55.621
Secure the front with Harris.

1322
01:18:57.724 --> 01:18:58.823
Imlay, anything?

1323
01:18:58.825 --> 01:19:01.277
Nothing, staff sergeant.
We only got maps of Santa Monica.

1324
01:19:01.686 --> 01:19:03.871
We need something farther east.
They're all burned.

1325
01:19:04.481 --> 01:19:05.564
Follow me, Imlay.

1326
01:19:10.528 --> 01:19:11.219
Alright.

1327
01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:13.064
Here's the battalion commander's hooch.

1328
01:19:13.531 --> 01:19:15.949
We're looking for maps,
anything with an extraction point.

1329
01:19:16.017 --> 01:19:17.110
Ok staff sergeant.

1330
01:19:27.212 --> 01:19:28.404
I'll be right back.

1331
01:19:35.345 --> 01:19:37.229
Found a tactical map, staff sergeant.

1332
01:19:37.597 --> 01:19:39.415
Shows where all the units
were deployed.

1333
01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:41.933
What the hell are all these red marks?

1334
01:19:41.934 --> 01:19:43.086
It means they're gone.

1335
01:19:43.895 --> 01:19:45.148
You mean the units got moved?

1336
01:19:45.349 --> 01:19:46.439
Wiped out.

1337
01:19:47.565 --> 01:19:48.462
All of them?

1338
01:19:48.563 --> 01:19:49.583
All of them.

1339
01:19:50.193 --> 01:19:51.193
Oh, shit.

1340
01:19:51.653 --> 01:19:52.174
Alright.

1341
01:19:52.575 --> 01:19:55.181
One alternate extraction site
is still operational.

1342
01:19:56.533 --> 01:19:57.742
That's eight klicks.

1343
01:19:58.451 --> 01:19:59.427
Staff sergeant?

1344
01:20:00.728 --> 01:20:01.746
Staff sergeant?

1345
01:20:03.164 --> 01:20:04.611
Adukwu, plenty of weapons around.

1346
01:20:04.612 --> 01:20:05.958
Find yourself an M-16.

1347
01:20:06.376 --> 01:20:07.510
Mr. Rincon is dead.

1348
01:20:32.402 --> 01:20:33.627
Wake up, Dad.

1349
01:20:42.287 --> 01:20:44.155
Please help me right now.

1350
01:20:46.875 --> 01:20:48.225
Don't leave me.

1351
01:20:54.174 --> 01:20:55.850
I'm so sorry, Hector.

1352
01:21:00.638 --> 01:21:01.697
I'm sorry.

1353
01:21:03.183 --> 01:21:04.183
No.

1354
01:21:04.476 --> 01:21:07.412
Your dad tried so hard to stay with you.

1355
01:21:09.814 --> 01:21:11.465
I'm sorr...
I don't wanna be here.

1356
01:21:19.032 --> 01:21:20.199
It's ok, bud.

1357
01:21:27.874 --> 01:21:29.951
Your father was a brave man, Hector.

1358
01:21:40.011 --> 01:21:41.323
Hector, I'm sorry.

1359
01:21:42.624 --> 01:21:43.856
I'm sorry, buddy.

1360
01:21:44.766 --> 01:21:46.250
It's ok to cry.

1361
01:21:52.106 --> 01:21:53.458
He loved you very much.

1362
01:21:55.443 --> 01:21:56.861
Listen to me, Hector.

1363
01:21:59.030 --> 01:22:00.319
I need you to be brave for me.

1364
01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:03.475
I need you to be my little Marine.

1365
01:22:06.204 --> 01:22:07.204
Ok?

1366
01:22:09.541 --> 01:22:11.234
We gotta be brave for the others.

1367
01:22:14.671 --> 01:22:15.896
Do you know why?

1368
01:22:18.258 --> 01:22:19.258
Why?

1369
01:22:22.846 --> 01:22:24.689
Because Marines don't quit.

1370
01:22:27.559 --> 01:22:29.017
Do you believe that?

1371
01:22:31.563 --> 01:22:32.771
Say it for me.

1372
01:22:35.900 --> 01:22:37.859
Marines don't quit.

1373
01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:39.386
Good.

1374
01:22:40.029 --> 01:22:41.831
I'm gonna get you out of here, Hector.

1375
01:22:42.732 --> 01:22:43.732
I promise.

1376
01:22:47.662 --> 01:22:49.131
Let's go see the girls, ok?

1377
01:22:49.132 --> 01:22:50.114
Come on.

1378
01:23:08.391 --> 01:23:10.565
We are not losing one more
of those civilians.

1379
01:23:10.566 --> 01:23:11.610
Understand?

1380
01:23:14.105 --> 01:23:16.140
You getting us out too,
staff sergeant?

1381
01:23:19.110 --> 01:23:20.619
Or are we expendable?

1382
01:23:30.622 --> 01:23:31.772
Alright, Lockett.

1383
01:23:33.207 --> 01:23:34.859
You wanna go there, let's go there.

1384
01:23:39.756 --> 01:23:42.466
I commanded men and men died.

1385
01:23:42.717 --> 01:23:45.225
Kids. 19 years old.

1386
01:23:45.226 --> 01:23:46.887
The best men I ever led.

1387
01:23:48.139 --> 01:23:50.367
Do you think for one second,

1388
01:23:50.568 --> 01:23:52.676
that I wouldn't rather trade
places with them?

1389
01:23:59.233 --> 01:24:01.385
I know you think I got my men killed.

1390
01:24:04.864 --> 01:24:06.165
They're dead.

1391
01:24:07.992 --> 01:24:09.293
I'm here.

1392
01:24:10.328 --> 01:24:12.529
Like the punch line to some bad joke.

1393
01:24:13.081 --> 01:24:14.298
You think I like that?

1394
01:24:15.333 --> 01:24:17.407
Do you think a minute goes by,

1395
01:24:17.408 --> 01:24:20.204
that those faces aren't right here
seared into my brain?

1396
01:24:24.342 --> 01:24:28.845
Dante, Thomas T. Corporal.
1-5-6-5-0-9-3-8-6.

1397
01:24:29.013 --> 01:24:34.385
Ambruster, William R. Private.
8-7-6-6-6-2-3-5-4.

1398
01:24:35.395 --> 01:24:37.538
Wharton, Jeffrey H.

1399
01:24:38.147 --> 01:24:39.541
Lance Corporal.

1400
01:24:40.042 --> 01:24:43.193
8-7-4-2-7-3-9-9-3.

1401
01:24:47.115 --> 01:24:48.257
Lockett.

1402
01:24:51.619 --> 01:24:54.021
Duane G.

1403
01:24:56.290 --> 01:24:57.316
Corporal.

1404
01:24:59.544 --> 01:25:03.614
1-5-6-8-7-0-9.

1405
01:25:04.549 --> 01:25:05.941
5-5.

1406
01:25:08.428 --> 01:25:10.379
Your brother was
an outstanding Marine.

1407
01:25:13.850 --> 01:25:15.117
He was my friend.

1408
01:25:16.144 --> 01:25:17.381
And I miss him...

1409
01:25:18.682 --> 01:25:20.523
every day.

1410
01:25:24.068 --> 01:25:25.569
And you remind me of him.

1411
01:25:34.912 --> 01:25:36.580
None of that matters right now.

1412
01:25:38.916 --> 01:25:41.736
Because our duty is to keep
moving forwards, to keep fighting.

1413
01:25:44.005 --> 01:25:45.714
That's how we honour your brother,

1414
01:25:46.340 --> 01:25:47.891
and Lieutenant Martinez,

1415
01:25:48.342 --> 01:25:49.843
Corporal Stavrou,

1416
01:25:50.553 --> 01:25:52.154
Lance Corporal Mottola,

1417
01:25:53.431 --> 01:25:54.656
Hector's father,

1418
01:25:55.433 --> 01:25:57.750
who picked up a rifle
and did what needed to be done.

1419
01:25:57.751 --> 01:25:58.769
A civilian did that.

1420
01:25:58.978 --> 01:26:00.754
So we better damn well step it up.

1421
01:26:01.564 --> 01:26:03.407
Discard any lingering doubt.

1422
01:26:04.192 --> 01:26:06.877
Work fast, work as a unit,
and we will prevail.

1423
01:26:07.228 --> 01:26:09.079
Let's figure out how
we're gonna get out of this mess.

1424
01:26:09.530 --> 01:26:11.615
Imlay, you come with me.
We need to get to higher ground.

1425
01:26:11.866 --> 01:26:14.409
The rest of you, find some ammo
and some vehicles.

1426
01:26:14.619 --> 01:26:17.421
Gotta be a few LAV's or armoured
Humvees still operational.

1427
01:26:18.998 --> 01:26:20.259
Sorry, bro.

1428
01:26:20.260 --> 01:26:21.509
You didn't deserve this.

1429
01:26:25.630 --> 01:26:27.023
You went down fighting.

1430
01:26:34.305 --> 01:26:35.364
Holy shit.

1431
01:26:35.973 --> 01:26:37.574
I wasn't expecting to see all this.

1432
01:26:39.644 --> 01:26:41.111
That don't look good.

1433
01:26:41.562 --> 01:26:42.813
Reinforcements.

1434
01:26:47.110 --> 01:26:48.336
Holy shit.

1435
01:26:50.988 --> 01:26:52.640
They already set up a beachhead.

1436
01:26:54.158 --> 01:26:55.158
Alright.

1437
01:26:57.078 --> 01:26:58.973
If that evac site is still operational,

1438
01:26:59.274 --> 01:27:00.948
I think we can get behind the line.

1439
01:27:01.457 --> 01:27:03.433
That's gonna be one hell of a ride,
staff sergeant.

1440
01:27:03.584 --> 01:27:05.202
Yeah, well, that's what
we get paid for.

1441
01:27:05.670 --> 01:27:07.525
Everybody move to the LAV now!

1442
01:27:08.526 --> 01:27:09.297
Go!

1443
01:27:09.907 --> 01:27:12.208
Any station, this net.
This is Foxtrot-Two-November.

1444
01:27:12.276 --> 01:27:13.593
We have 11 passengers.

1445
01:27:13.594 --> 01:27:17.348
Requesting, evacuation at alternate
extraction point Charlie.

1446
01:27:18.057 --> 01:27:19.658
Are there any birds in the air?
Over.

1447
01:27:20.268 --> 01:27:23.004
<i>Foxtrot-Two-November,
this is Sierra 2-5.</i>

1448
01:27:23.005 --> 01:27:24.062
<i>Orders are to pull back.</i>

1449
01:27:24.272 --> 01:27:28.358
<i>Get to extraction point Charlie
by 0300 or we'll be gone. Over.</i>

1450
01:27:28.568 --> 01:27:31.028
Roger that.
0300, not a minute more. Out.

1451
01:27:34.114 --> 01:27:36.457
Imlay, you ever see what
a Bushmaster chain gun can do?

1452
01:27:36.467 --> 01:27:38.660
Oh, shit, yes, staff sergeant.
Get on it, son.

1453
01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:40.271
Let's do this!

1454
01:27:44.876 --> 01:27:46.376
No lights, Kerns.
Roger that.

1455
01:27:47.378 --> 01:27:48.404
Let's move.

1456
01:27:52.216 --> 01:27:53.742
Bushmaster is locked and loaded.

1457
01:27:54.051 --> 01:27:55.202
Give them hell.

1458
01:27:55.511 --> 01:27:56.612
Damn right.

1459
01:28:08.566 --> 01:28:10.234
Two minutes till that helo drops.

1460
01:28:13.404 --> 01:28:14.655
Everybody ok?

1461
01:28:18.159 --> 01:28:19.083
Alright, Kerns,

1462
01:28:19.484 --> 01:28:20.644
take a left.

1463
01:28:21.412 --> 01:28:23.372
I want you to go over three blocks,

1464
01:28:23.373 --> 01:28:24.664
then you go about five blocks,

1465
01:28:25.074 --> 01:28:26.450
hang a right, and straight.

1466
01:28:27.001 --> 01:28:28.534
That should get us to the evac site.

1467
01:28:28.535 --> 01:28:29.636
Yes, staff sergeant.

1468
01:28:31.923 --> 01:28:34.191
I'd hold on if I were you, Lockett!

1469
01:28:34.192 --> 01:28:35.259
Copy that!

1470
01:28:37.595 --> 01:28:39.429
We got hostiles, staff sergeant.
What's going on?

1471
01:28:39.639 --> 01:28:41.357
Let's not wait around and find out.

1472
01:28:41.358 --> 01:28:42.599
It's gonna be ok.

1473
01:28:42.767 --> 01:28:45.002
Got about 250 rounds,
staff sergeant.

1474
01:28:53.694 --> 01:28:55.545
Know what they say if you hit a deer?

1475
01:28:55.696 --> 01:28:57.447
Speed up!
Damn straight!

1476
01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:04.014
Come on!

1477
01:29:04.315 --> 01:29:06.557
Y'all hold on! We're gonna have
to go right through them!

1478
01:29:12.838 --> 01:29:13.970
You saw that?

1479
01:29:13.971 --> 01:29:15.632
They're going down like bowling pins!

1480
01:29:40.074 --> 01:29:41.116
Kick it out!

1481
01:29:41.951 --> 01:29:43.919
Run that sucker over, man!

1482
01:29:46.956 --> 01:29:48.081
Santos, you ok?

1483
01:29:48.916 --> 01:29:51.693
I got that nasty stuff
all over my mouth, man!

1484
01:29:54.338 --> 01:29:55.549
It's not funny.

1485
01:29:55.550 --> 01:29:57.474
You let him do you on the first date.

1486
01:30:12.023 --> 01:30:13.270
Everyone ok?

1487
01:30:13.671 --> 01:30:14.491
Yes!

1488
01:30:16.068 --> 01:30:17.277
Let's get us home.

1489
01:30:23.701 --> 01:30:25.102
Cease fire!

1490
01:30:30.333 --> 01:30:31.570
Stay close, stay close!

1491
01:30:31.871 --> 01:30:32.909
What are we doing?

1492
01:30:36.380 --> 01:30:37.144
Load them up!

1493
01:30:37.145 --> 01:30:39.499
Our flight path won't be
clear much longer!

1494
01:30:40.009 --> 01:30:41.968
You're in the middle of the shit,
staff sergeant!

1495
01:30:42.136 --> 01:30:43.495
What happened to all our air?

1496
01:30:43.496 --> 01:30:45.085
Pulled back to save our assets!

1497
01:30:45.086 --> 01:30:46.640
They were blowing us out!

1498
01:30:47.350 --> 01:30:49.017
We're abandoning Los Angeles!

1499
01:30:58.861 --> 01:31:00.162
Let's go, Imlay!

1500
01:31:01.197 --> 01:31:02.306
Son, you ok?

1501
01:31:04.784 --> 01:31:05.759
Alright.

1502
01:31:07.278 --> 01:31:08.137
Let's move!

1503
01:31:08.438 --> 01:31:09.496
Move, move!

1504
01:31:11.123 --> 01:31:12.508
Come on, Harris, let's go!

1505
01:31:55.209 --> 01:31:56.268
Hold on!

1506
01:31:59.630 --> 01:32:00.719
You alright?
Yeah!

1507
01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:01.456
Everybody all good?

1508
01:32:01.465 --> 01:32:02.328
Girls?
Yeah.

1509
01:32:02.629 --> 01:32:03.816
Everybody ok?

1510
01:32:03.926 --> 01:32:04.952
Hold on tight!

1511
01:32:07.388 --> 01:32:08.396
What happened?

1512
01:32:08.806 --> 01:32:11.658
Pilot said something
was playing hell with our power!

1513
01:32:12.268 --> 01:32:13.401
Staff sergeant!

1514
01:32:13.602 --> 01:32:14.845
Nine o'clock!

1515
01:32:21.569 --> 01:32:24.637
Santos, you said you were tracking
massive RF signals?

1516
01:32:24.947 --> 01:32:27.532
Could a concentration
of them knock out power?

1517
01:32:29.660 --> 01:32:31.619
Yes, definitely!
Why?

1518
01:32:31.996 --> 01:32:34.372
Could be their command
and control centre!

1519
01:32:37.710 --> 01:32:39.210
Get me down there!

1520
01:32:39.420 --> 01:32:40.437
What?

1521
01:32:41.964 --> 01:32:44.057
I gotta recon that area!

1522
01:32:44.467 --> 01:32:46.359
No way!
It's a suicide!

1523
01:32:46.969 --> 01:32:48.743
Damn it, we're the only ones left!

1524
01:32:48.744 --> 01:32:50.722
All the other forces have fallen back!

1525
01:32:50.931 --> 01:32:52.241
We can't land!

1526
01:32:52.242 --> 01:32:54.718
May not have power to take off again!

1527
01:33:02.902 --> 01:33:04.978
This is a letter for Martinez's wife.

1528
01:33:06.655 --> 01:33:08.098
Will you get it to her?

1529
01:33:11.535 --> 01:33:12.535
Yeah.

1530
01:33:18.292 --> 01:33:19.960
Hover at 40 feet!

1531
01:33:21.462 --> 01:33:22.879
Twenty seconds!
Roger that!

1532
01:33:27.426 --> 01:33:29.386
Come on, Adukwu, let's get this off.

1533
01:33:30.095 --> 01:33:32.205
Staff sergeant,
what the hell are you doing?

1534
01:33:32.515 --> 01:33:35.117
We're in the clear!
We're almost home, Imlay!

1535
01:33:35.726 --> 01:33:37.210
You're in charge now!

1536
01:33:38.687 --> 01:33:40.756
You get these civilians home safe!

1537
01:33:45.653 --> 01:33:48.029
You're the bravest Marine
I ever seen, Hector!

1538
01:33:49.448 --> 01:33:50.490
No!

1539
01:34:34.952 --> 01:34:36.495
Everybody, take cover.

1540
01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:41.541
I told you to stay in that helo.

1541
01:34:41.750 --> 01:34:43.126
Civilians are free and clear.

1542
01:34:43.227 --> 01:34:44.753
We were worried about your ass.

1543
01:34:45.629 --> 01:34:47.839
I think the command and control
asset is nearby.

1544
01:34:48.424 --> 01:34:49.427
Kerns.

1545
01:34:49.728 --> 01:34:50.850
How many klicks to that blackout?

1546
01:34:51.210 --> 01:34:52.719
It's about five klicks, staff sergeant.

1547
01:34:53.229 --> 01:34:54.079
Five klicks.

1548
01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:55.087
Alright.

1549
01:34:55.472 --> 01:34:57.199
We're gonna use this overpass
for cover.

1550
01:34:58.892 --> 01:35:00.310
If we could take out those drones

1551
01:35:00.519 --> 01:35:03.122
our military might have a chance
to get back into this fight.

1552
01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:05.440
Santos.

1553
01:35:06.442 --> 01:35:08.139
Where would you put a command
and control asset

1554
01:35:08.140 --> 01:35:09.311
if you wanted to protect it?

1555
01:35:11.405 --> 01:35:12.338
Underground.

1556
01:35:12.739 --> 01:35:13.556
Let's go.

1557
01:35:14.825 --> 01:35:16.429
Everybody, let's move.

1558
01:35:16.430 --> 01:35:17.952
Come on. Move, move, move.

1559
01:35:43.437 --> 01:35:44.237
Move.

1560
01:36:38.909 --> 01:36:41.061
They must've gone back up.
Just leads up to the street.

1561
01:36:41.870 --> 01:36:44.056
I thought they were leading us
to the command and control centre.

1562
01:36:45.416 --> 01:36:46.374
Damn it.

1563
01:36:51.213 --> 01:36:52.006
Let's go.

1564
01:36:52.007 --> 01:36:52.981
Back.

1565
01:37:02.015 --> 01:37:03.150
Holy shit!

1566
01:37:04.935 --> 01:37:05.961
Santos!

1567
01:37:22.453 --> 01:37:23.628
They know we're here now.

1568
01:37:34.923 --> 01:37:36.475
That's their command and control.

1569
01:37:42.681 --> 01:37:43.791
Everybody out now!

1570
01:37:43.792 --> 01:37:45.275
Move, move, move! Follow me!

1571
01:37:45.976 --> 01:37:48.079
Up here!
Up that ladder, go!

1572
01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:49.787
Move, move, move!
Up that ladder!

1573
01:37:50.522 --> 01:37:52.915
Let's go! Move it up!
Blow that grate, Imlay!

1574
01:37:54.234 --> 01:37:55.443
Move, move, move, move!

1575
01:38:02.242 --> 01:38:03.993
We're right over
their command asset.

1576
01:38:04.495 --> 01:38:05.413
That's it, alright.

1577
01:38:05.514 --> 01:38:08.148
Ok. Let's move
the concrete slab, 1 o'clock.

1578
01:38:08.149 --> 01:38:09.149
Let's move.

1579
01:38:10.918 --> 01:38:12.268
Fire in the hole!

1580
01:38:12.878 --> 01:38:14.513
That should give us
a couple minutes.

1581
01:38:31.522 --> 01:38:32.957
Laser target, staff sergeant?

1582
01:38:33.358 --> 01:38:34.807
We don't have any more jets,
though, right?

1583
01:38:34.817 --> 01:38:37.844
Hopefully they could still fire ground to ground
missiles from Edwards Air Force Base.

1584
01:38:38.111 --> 01:38:40.613
We radio in a strike, paint the target
with the laser to guide them in.

1585
01:38:40.823 --> 01:38:42.190
Aye, aye, staff sergeant.
Hoorah.

1586
01:38:42.191 --> 01:38:45.343
Our best chance at radio reception
is on top of that building,

1587
01:38:45.911 --> 01:38:47.128
but it's the most exposed.

1588
01:38:47.538 --> 01:38:48.748
I'll do it, staff sergeant.

1589
01:38:49.049 --> 01:38:50.097
I'll make the call.

1590
01:38:50.207 --> 01:38:51.666
Santos, you got those codes?

1591
01:38:51.875 --> 01:38:53.618
Air Force strike package coming up.

1592
01:38:55.104 --> 01:38:56.205
You get to high ground.

1593
01:38:56.806 --> 01:38:58.714
Alright! Once you radio in,
they'll track that signal.

1594
01:38:58.924 --> 01:39:00.620
Things are gonna get real hot, real fast.

1595
01:39:00.676 --> 01:39:02.811
So once you make that call,
you get the hell out of there, alright?

1596
01:39:04.555 --> 01:39:05.721
You know what that means?

1597
01:39:05.931 --> 01:39:09.100
It mean we're gonna have to hold those
things off till the strike gets here.

1598
01:39:09.309 --> 01:39:10.291
Bingo.

1599
01:39:10.592 --> 01:39:11.440
Marines,

1600
01:39:12.541 --> 01:39:14.193
we make our stand here.

1601
01:39:14.994 --> 01:39:17.083
Let those bastards know
who they're fucking with.

1602
01:39:17.192 --> 01:39:18.234
Retreat.
Hell!

1603
01:39:18.443 --> 01:39:19.402
Two-Five.

1604
01:39:30.747 --> 01:39:32.062
Right of the heart, right?

1605
01:39:32.063 --> 01:39:33.082
Right of the heart.

1606
01:39:33.625 --> 01:39:34.828
They're gonna be coming up from there.

1607
01:39:34.829 --> 01:39:35.877
I need you to take two of these.

1608
01:39:35.886 --> 01:39:36.888
Plant one right there,

1609
01:39:36.989 --> 01:39:38.462
and the other one on the other side
of that road, alright?

1610
01:39:38.772 --> 01:39:41.199
Keep your head down, get it done.
Doc, watch your back, doc!

1611
01:39:41.508 --> 01:39:43.634
Watch your head!
Watch it!

1612
01:39:51.402 --> 01:39:53.902
Any station, this is Foxtrot-Two-November,
do you copy?

1613
01:39:57.503 --> 01:39:59.503
Any station, this is Foxtrot-Two-November,

1614
01:39:59.704 --> 01:40:00.568
do you copy?

1615
01:40:00.669 --> 01:40:02.920
<i>Foxtrot-Two-November,
this is Yankee-Tango, over.</i>

1616
01:40:03.030 --> 01:40:04.331
We have a priority fire mission.

1617
01:40:04.432 --> 01:40:06.700
We've located a major enemy
command and control centre,

1618
01:40:06.783 --> 01:40:10.044
under grid 885-342.

1619
01:40:10.454 --> 01:40:12.972
We will be lasing. Code 1-2-0.

1620
01:40:13.582 --> 01:40:16.000
I say again, we will be lasing.
Code 1-2-0.

1621
01:40:16.209 --> 01:40:18.053
<i>Copy that.
Time to target, three minutes.</i>

1622
01:40:20.756 --> 01:40:21.797
Staff sergeant!

1623
01:40:22.591 --> 01:40:24.985
We got three minutes!
It's coming in three minutes!

1624
01:40:26.094 --> 01:40:28.130
Alright.
Let's paint this target.

1625
01:40:40.692 --> 01:40:41.798
Hell of a shot, Kerns!

1626
01:40:41.799 --> 01:40:43.069
Get your ass out of there!

1627
01:40:44.863 --> 01:40:47.323
Get out of there, Kerns!
Shit.

1628
01:40:51.328 --> 01:40:53.287
Shit!
Kerns!

1629
01:40:56.249 --> 01:40:58.209
Shit!
Shit!

1630
01:41:03.048 --> 01:41:04.043
Doc, Doc!

1631
01:41:04.044 --> 01:41:06.008
Get to cover now! Move, move!

1632
01:41:06.009 --> 01:41:06.693
Shit.

1633
01:41:10.722 --> 01:41:12.473
Contact!
Twelve o'clock!

1634
01:41:13.392 --> 01:41:14.884
Covering up front!

1635
01:41:15.394 --> 01:41:17.395
Go, go, go!
Go on, get in there!

1636
01:41:19.147 --> 01:41:20.940
Shift fire left!
Shift fire left!

1637
01:41:22.109 --> 01:41:23.651
Right there, right there!

1638
01:41:29.282 --> 01:41:30.316
Got it!

1639
01:41:31.493 --> 01:41:33.027
Sixty seconds left.

1640
01:41:43.130 --> 01:41:45.631
Lockett!
Shit!

1641
01:41:49.219 --> 01:41:50.236
Let's go!

1642
01:41:58.186 --> 01:41:59.554
Back in the fight, Santos!

1643
01:42:01.148 --> 01:42:02.364
Need a little help!

1644
01:42:02.365 --> 01:42:02.982
Covering!

1645
01:42:03.191 --> 01:42:05.234
Imlay, use your grenade launcher!

1646
01:42:05.444 --> 01:42:06.490
I got it, Doc!

1647
01:42:06.491 --> 01:42:07.511
Covering!

1648
01:42:15.787 --> 01:42:17.178
Where's that goddamn artillery?

1649
01:42:17.179 --> 01:42:18.356
Should've hit by now.

1650
01:42:19.958 --> 01:42:21.409
Doc, let's go!

1651
01:42:25.255 --> 01:42:26.513
Doc?
Imlay!

1652
01:42:26.914 --> 01:42:27.973
Imlay!

1653
01:42:36.433 --> 01:42:37.642
Incoming!

1654
01:42:43.523 --> 01:42:44.557
Yes!

1655
01:42:45.692 --> 01:42:47.860
Santos, we got it!
We got it!

1656
01:42:50.238 --> 01:42:52.482
Direct hit!
Direct hit!

1657
01:42:53.450 --> 01:42:54.742
Yes staff sergeant, you did it!

1658
01:42:56.043 --> 01:42:57.043
Staff sergeant, you did it!

1659
01:42:58.288 --> 01:42:59.580
Yes, we got it!

1660
01:43:00.082 --> 01:43:01.269
The strike package.

1661
01:43:01.470 --> 01:43:02.583
It went through?

1662
01:43:03.210 --> 01:43:04.986
It came through?
Yeah! Alright, Kerns!

1663
01:43:06.755 --> 01:43:07.772
It's over.

1664
01:43:25.273 --> 01:43:26.899
It's coming up.
It's coming up.

1665
01:43:39.121 --> 01:43:40.380
They're trying to get away.

1666
01:43:46.586 --> 01:43:48.412
The goddamn thing can fly,
staff sergeant.

1667
01:43:48.413 --> 01:43:49.822
It's flying now!

1668
01:43:50.132 --> 01:43:51.298
I'll get you out!

1669
01:43:59.474 --> 01:44:00.812
We gotta protect the laser. Come on.

1670
01:44:00.813 --> 01:44:01.859
Come on!

1671
01:44:03.979 --> 01:44:05.021
Santos!

1672
01:44:15.824 --> 01:44:17.024
Son of a bitch!

1673
01:44:19.870 --> 01:44:20.959
That hurt!

1674
01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:22.330
Cover me, Lockett!

1675
01:44:28.211 --> 01:44:30.589
The drones are pulling it away!
We gotta take it out now!

1676
01:44:35.218 --> 01:44:37.511
Incoming Copperhead!

1677
01:44:42.225 --> 01:44:44.260
They're using the drone
to protect the ship!

1678
01:44:48.607 --> 01:44:50.057
I'm running low on ammo!

1679
01:44:50.567 --> 01:44:51.584
Santos!

1680
01:44:56.281 --> 01:44:56.925
How is he?

1681
01:44:57.426 --> 01:44:59.025
He's hanging in there,
staff sergeant!

1682
01:44:59.534 --> 01:45:01.660
Crazy bastard.
You should've left me there.

1683
01:45:06.333 --> 01:45:07.333
Covering!

1684
01:45:08.752 --> 01:45:09.860
Grenade!

1685
01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:19.161
Staff sergeant!
We are not dying here, Lockett!

1686
01:45:19.162 --> 01:45:20.655
You damn right we're not dying!

1687
01:45:23.058 --> 01:45:25.309
It's getting out of range!
I gotta take it down!

1688
01:45:25.518 --> 01:45:27.719
Doesn't have enough punch!
Save that shot!

1689
01:45:37.113 --> 01:45:38.506
Staff sergeant!

1690
01:45:39.115 --> 01:45:40.407
Lockett, you ok?

1691
01:45:40.617 --> 01:45:42.476
Harris, you're gonna be ok.

1692
01:46:06.977 --> 01:46:08.511
There's the last Copperhead.

1693
01:46:13.149 --> 01:46:15.376
Santos, take out that drone!

1694
01:46:18.154 --> 01:46:19.205
Firing!

1695
01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:38.382
Yeah!
We did it!

1696
01:46:40.593 --> 01:46:41.513
We did it!

1697
01:46:49.853 --> 01:46:51.830
I can't believe it worked!

1698
01:46:58.862 --> 01:46:59.971
Yeah!

1699
01:47:00.780 --> 01:47:02.306
Staff sergeant, you did it!

1700
01:47:04.701 --> 01:47:06.903
There's nothing controlling
the drones anymore!

1701
01:47:14.294 --> 01:47:15.828
Marines, on me!

1702
01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:30.501
They're retreating.
Advance!

1703
01:48:41.756 --> 01:48:43.832
You guys saved our lives out there!

1704
01:48:43.842 --> 01:48:45.717
Semper Fi, Two-Five!

1705
01:48:45.969 --> 01:48:47.376
Alright, Two-Five!

1706
01:48:48.077 --> 01:48:49.346
Retreat, hell!

1707
01:48:49.556 --> 01:48:51.924
You kicked ass, staff sarge!
Welcome home!

1708
01:48:53.143 --> 01:48:54.357
Move! Move! Move!

1709
01:48:54.358 --> 01:48:55.515
Good work, Marines!

1710
01:48:55.916 --> 01:48:56.895
Outstanding.

1711
01:48:56.980 --> 01:48:58.656
Your civilians are safe.

1712
01:48:59.065 --> 01:49:01.350
Word of how you brought
their ship down,

1713
01:49:01.818 --> 01:49:04.328
is going out to every army
in every city.

1714
01:49:04.737 --> 01:49:07.099
We're mustering up whatever troops we can get,

1715
01:49:07.100 --> 01:49:08.340
and going back in.

1716
01:49:08.992 --> 01:49:10.534
So get out of that gear.

1717
01:49:11.619 --> 01:49:12.828
Get some show in you.

1718
01:49:13.288 --> 01:49:14.964
There's breakfast in the tent.

1719
01:49:15.373 --> 01:49:16.417
You earned it.

1720
01:49:16.818 --> 01:49:18.292
Hoorah, Two-Five.

1721
01:50:07.258 --> 01:50:08.759
Get some smoke, Imlay.
Got you.

1722
01:50:08.968 --> 01:50:10.378
Got grenades over here.
Anybody need?

1723
01:50:10.379 --> 01:50:10.986
Yeah.

1724
01:50:11.387 --> 01:50:12.683
Got frag rounds coming down.

1725
01:50:13.484 --> 01:50:15.899
Imlay, I think you could use this.
Yeah.

1726
01:50:16.308 --> 01:50:18.227
Got it. He rounds.
I need a couple more magazines.

1727
01:50:18.937 --> 01:50:20.127
Very nice, very nice.

1728
01:50:20.128 --> 01:50:21.188
Everybody got ammo?

1729
01:50:21.397 --> 01:50:22.556
Yes, staff sergeant.

1730
01:50:23.274 --> 01:50:25.176
What do you think you're doing,
staff sergeant?

1731
01:50:26.569 --> 01:50:28.220
We already had breakfast, sir.

1732
01:50:35.621 --> 01:50:36.921
Move! Move! Move!

1733
01:50:37.914 --> 01:50:39.448
I'll be borrowing this, sir.

1734
01:50:39.999 --> 01:50:41.016
Carry on.

1735
01:50:42.544 --> 01:50:44.586
Retreat, hell!
Hoorah!

1736
01:50:45.755 --> 01:50:47.756
<i>This is Bullpen 2-3.
Who's with me?</i>

1737
01:50:48.007 --> 01:50:50.625
<i>Morning, Bullpen.
Dog Pound 2-1, on your left.</i>

1738
01:50:50.626 --> 01:50:52.569
<i>Good to hear a friendly voice,
Dog Pound 2-1.</i>

1739
01:50:52.637 --> 01:50:54.963
<i>Liberty 1-1, Snake Eyes
joining the fight.</i>

1740
01:50:54.964 --> 01:50:57.238
<i>Yankee-Foxtrot-2-1,
we're on your six.</i>

1741
01:50:57.239 --> 01:50:58.767
<i>Morning, Dog Pound 2-1.
Eagle on your right.</i>

1742
01:50:58.935 --> 01:51:00.849
<i>This is Foxtrot-Two-November.</i>

1743
01:51:00.850 --> 01:51:02.530
<i>Let's take back Los Angeles.</i>
