1
00:00:00,246 --> 00:00:02,272
Previously on Incorporated...

2
00:00:02,273 --> 00:00:03,883
I haven't been on the
other side of the wall...

3
00:00:03,884 --> 00:00:05,617
In eight years.

4
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:06,826
I've been having the episodes again.

5
00:00:06,827 --> 00:00:07,832
You have to make a decision.

6
00:00:07,833 --> 00:00:10,755
Are you gonna let one twist
of fate decide who you are?

7
00:00:10,756 --> 00:00:12,388
My neighbor Rosa... her daughter...

8
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:13,823
there's something wrong with her belly.

9
00:00:13,925 --> 00:00:16,086
I've been hearing her
scream through the night.

10
00:00:16,087 --> 00:00:17,460
Is the pain on her right side?

11
00:00:17,813 --> 00:00:19,046
It could be appendicitis.

12
00:00:19,384 --> 00:00:21,016
Your friend's daughter...
bring her tonight.

13
00:00:21,017 --> 00:00:21,635
I'll examine her.

14
00:00:21,636 --> 00:00:23,377
These people aren't authorized
to be in the perimeter.

15
00:00:23,378 --> 00:00:24,634
They're on the log.

16
00:00:25,938 --> 00:00:28,633
You haven't told him about
the riot you started?

17
00:00:28,634 --> 00:00:29,824
What if she's pregnant?

18
00:00:29,825 --> 00:00:32,797
Your plan is to take birth control

19
00:00:32,798 --> 00:00:34,264
behind your wife's back?

20
00:00:34,366 --> 00:00:35,499
I don't want to hurt her.

21
00:00:35,601 --> 00:00:37,969
You know I miss your
father as much as you do.

22
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:41,906
We're not both equally
responsible for his absence, are we?

23
00:00:41,907 --> 00:00:43,540
Hello, Aaron.

24
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:45,786
You're skint from the 'fugee camp

25
00:00:45,787 --> 00:00:47,371
who assumed a Green Zone identity.

26
00:00:47,372 --> 00:00:49,212
I can give you what you want.

27
00:00:49,432 --> 00:00:50,614
Get me into Arcadia.

28
00:00:50,716 --> 00:00:52,463
I can't let her die in that place.

29
00:00:55,287 --> 00:00:57,621
You're gonna destroy everything.

30
00:00:57,723 --> 00:00:59,957
I can't let you hurt my family!

31
00:01:00,173 --> 00:01:01,403
What happened?

32
00:01:01,404 --> 00:01:02,359
He knew who I was.

33
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:04,299
Everything I'm doing

34
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,395
is for Elena.

35
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:07,793
I have a plan, Theo.

36
00:01:07,794 --> 00:01:10,331
The body, the watch...
it's all going to help us.

37
00:01:10,332 --> 00:01:11,401
You have to trust me.

38
00:01:15,028 --> 00:01:16,961
Are you ready, Mr. Larson?

39
00:01:24,437 --> 00:01:27,171
We're waiting.

40
00:01:28,331 --> 00:01:29,474
Of course.

41
00:01:40,387 --> 00:01:44,481
What's your success rate in extracting
actionable information?

42
00:01:44,482 --> 00:01:47,484
The results are...

43
00:01:47,485 --> 00:01:48,584
p-promising.

44
00:01:48,686 --> 00:01:52,857
We've achieved success
across all data sets,

45
00:01:52,858 --> 00:01:56,592
but...

46
00:01:56,838 --> 00:01:58,538
Ben?

47
00:01:58,748 --> 00:02:00,833
May I remind you your promotion

48
00:02:00,834 --> 00:02:02,742
depends on this presentation?

49
00:02:31,971 --> 00:02:33,506
Morning health scan.

50
00:02:34,191 --> 00:02:35,612
Heart rate elevated.

51
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,780
Cortisol and adrenaline surge detected.

52
00:02:38,442 --> 00:02:41,555
Recommend guided meditation
or stress reduction.

53
00:02:41,556 --> 00:02:44,617
BLOOD PRESSURE: 125/86 - CORTISOL:
29 MCG/DL SPERM COUNT: LOW

54
00:02:56,661 --> 00:03:00,263
Surety Servants offers the
very best in domestic health.

55
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:02,431
Our hand-picked staff
are specially trained

56
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:03,857
in cleaning, cooking,

57
00:03:03,858 --> 00:03:05,125
shopping, and laundry.

58
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:07,465
We even provide pet care.

59
00:03:07,567 --> 00:03:10,301
All this, plus real-time
monitoring of your servants,

60
00:03:10,403 --> 00:03:13,386
gives you peace of mind and a happy home.

61
00:03:13,387 --> 00:03:15,987
You work hard. Let a Surety Servant...

62
00:03:16,089 --> 00:03:18,390
Block Surety Servants.

63
00:03:18,492 --> 00:03:21,417
Feel sorry for those weeds.

64
00:03:21,418 --> 00:03:23,418
They have no idea what they're in for.

65
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,855
Yeah, that's me.

66
00:03:26,235 --> 00:03:28,568
Ruthless.

67
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,203
You're not ruthless.

68
00:03:30,305 --> 00:03:32,639
You just...

69
00:03:32,741 --> 00:03:35,142
do what needs to be done

70
00:03:35,244 --> 00:03:36,876
and move forward.

71
00:03:48,257 --> 00:03:49,789
This is Rachel Brown.

72
00:03:49,891 --> 00:03:51,091
Please leave a message.

73
00:03:51,193 --> 00:03:52,092
Rachel,

74
00:03:52,194 --> 00:03:53,160
I just wanted to see

75
00:03:53,262 --> 00:03:54,894
how you were, and...

76
00:03:54,996 --> 00:03:56,229
how the girl's doing?

77
00:03:56,331 --> 00:03:57,897
Did she get her appendix out?

78
00:03:57,999 --> 00:03:59,866
Call me, please.

79
00:04:03,705 --> 00:04:04,971
Good morning, Dr. Larson.

80
00:04:05,074 --> 00:04:06,873
- ENTER DESTINATION
- What is your destination?

81
00:04:09,178 --> 00:04:12,011
Drive to 2714 Center Street.

82
00:04:12,608 --> 00:04:16,668
Warning: that address is located
outside of a secure corporate area.

83
00:04:17,119 --> 00:04:18,118
Do you accept?

84
00:04:19,821 --> 00:04:20,887
Do you accept?

85
00:04:22,236 --> 00:04:23,193
Do you accept?

86
00:04:23,194 --> 00:04:24,967
UNSECURE AREA: CONFIRMATION REQUIRED
POCKET ROCKET CLUB

87
00:04:24,968 --> 00:04:26,594
Hell, yes.

88
00:04:26,595 --> 00:04:28,628
8 YEARS EARLIER

89
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:33,066
Can you please put on some lipstick?

90
00:04:33,168 --> 00:04:34,667
- I'm not sharing your lipstick.
- Yes.

91
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:36,636
You probably caught something already.

92
00:04:36,738 --> 00:04:37,846
I probably did.

93
00:04:38,773 --> 00:04:40,073
Incoming call.

94
00:04:40,175 --> 00:04:42,008
Hold on a second.

95
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,042
I can't believe you just said that...

96
00:04:43,145 --> 00:04:44,111
Hey, Mom.

97
00:04:44,213 --> 00:04:47,248
Our reservations are for
1:00 tomorrow at the club.

98
00:04:47,249 --> 00:04:48,229
Reservations?

99
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,850
I swear I had orange.

100
00:04:49,851 --> 00:04:51,684
Who wants orange eyes?

101
00:04:51,786 --> 00:04:53,886
- Guys!
- The Rezas are in town.

102
00:04:53,989 --> 00:04:55,688
We're meeting them for lunch, remember?

103
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,090
Right.

104
00:04:57,192 --> 00:04:58,691
Yeah, it'll be good to see them.

105
00:04:58,793 --> 00:05:00,127
So what you doing this evening?

106
00:05:00,229 --> 00:05:02,061
Not much, just...

107
00:05:02,164 --> 00:05:03,597
we're gonna grab dinner.

108
00:05:03,698 --> 00:05:05,732
Well, don't stay out too late.

109
00:05:05,834 --> 00:05:07,700
The Rezas were such a
help after your dad died.

110
00:05:07,802 --> 00:05:09,302
I don't want you falling
asleep at the table.

111
00:05:09,404 --> 00:05:11,070
I won't. I promise.

112
00:05:12,341 --> 00:05:13,673
I love you.

113
00:05:13,775 --> 00:05:16,610
I love you too, Mom.

114
00:05:16,711 --> 00:05:19,646
Which is better, gold or purple?

115
00:05:19,648 --> 00:05:20,747
- Purple.
- Purple.

116
00:05:20,749 --> 00:05:21,781
You don't like gold?

117
00:05:21,883 --> 00:05:24,651
- It's okay.
- No.

118
00:05:24,753 --> 00:05:27,053
Are you actually updating
your emergency contact?

119
00:05:27,156 --> 00:05:29,922
My dad is in Brazil this month.

120
00:05:30,025 --> 00:05:32,392
You are so paranoid.

121
00:05:32,494 --> 00:05:33,893
Never hurts to be prepared.

122
00:05:33,995 --> 00:05:35,828
That mean you brought Spermishield?

123
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,799
- No.
- You did.

124
00:05:39,901 --> 00:05:41,067
- No!
- Amani!

125
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,935
She definitely brought it.

126
00:06:00,322 --> 00:06:02,789
Hey. Watch it.

127
00:06:05,427 --> 00:06:08,961
- What is wrong with you?
- Trust me, this freak loves it.

128
00:06:09,064 --> 00:06:10,863
Give me a poke, sweetheart.

129
00:06:13,268 --> 00:06:14,967
Come on.

130
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,803
Jesus, Amani, get it together.

131
00:06:16,905 --> 00:06:18,805
We look like a bunch of greenbacks.

132
00:06:22,043 --> 00:06:25,044
Or worse... narcs.

133
00:06:25,146 --> 00:06:27,214
Unbelievable.

134
00:06:27,316 --> 00:06:29,115
You know those guys?

135
00:06:29,218 --> 00:06:32,852
My mom must've tracked my car.

136
00:06:32,954 --> 00:06:37,023
I'm sorry, it's not like I
asked her to send bodyguards.

137
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,925
I'm gonna go dance.

138
00:06:40,962 --> 00:06:43,129
Your mom was just looking out for you.

139
00:06:43,232 --> 00:06:46,233
Come on, first drink's on me.

140
00:06:48,937 --> 00:06:50,704
What about him?

141
00:06:50,805 --> 00:06:51,904
He's hot.

142
00:06:52,006 --> 00:06:54,874
- But I don't know.
- Why not?

143
00:06:54,976 --> 00:06:56,309
He's definitely from outside the wall.

144
00:06:56,411 --> 00:06:58,111
What if you catch something?

145
00:06:58,213 --> 00:07:01,007
My God, you know you can't actually
catch Mumbai pox from dancing, right?

146
00:07:01,008 --> 00:07:03,116
Okay, you know what I mean.

147
00:07:03,218 --> 00:07:05,051
What is the point of
coming all this way

148
00:07:05,153 --> 00:07:08,822
if we don't even talk to
anyone who actually lives here?

149
00:07:08,823 --> 00:07:11,190
Tell that to Marisa.

150
00:07:11,293 --> 00:07:13,092
Nice.

151
00:07:13,194 --> 00:07:15,762
God, she's so concerned that
we're gonna ruin her cover,

152
00:07:15,864 --> 00:07:18,465
and she's over there chatting
up some Spiga D-bags.

153
00:07:18,567 --> 00:07:21,100
I guess she's all talk.

154
00:07:42,557 --> 00:07:44,291
I like a good girl with a wild streak.

155
00:07:44,393 --> 00:07:47,059
Yeah, who says I have a wild streak?

156
00:07:47,162 --> 00:07:49,128
I don't know. You're here, aren't you?

157
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:52,332
Sorry, I'm looking for someone.

158
00:07:52,434 --> 00:07:53,900
You get the best of both worlds.

159
00:07:54,002 --> 00:07:55,468
I help you scratch what itches

160
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:56,869
with no side effects.

161
00:07:56,971 --> 00:07:58,871
Get your hands off me.

162
00:07:58,973 --> 00:08:00,973
Is there a problem here?

163
00:08:01,075 --> 00:08:02,409
Fuck off, skint.

164
00:08:02,511 --> 00:08:03,876
If I have to spill these beers,

165
00:08:03,978 --> 00:08:05,378
you're gonna have a problem.

166
00:08:13,888 --> 00:08:15,488
- Thank you.
- It's all right.

167
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,123
You shouldn't have to put
up with that just because

168
00:08:17,225 --> 00:08:20,126
you're the prettiest girl in here.

169
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:24,764
You want to dance?

170
00:08:36,211 --> 00:08:39,011
Come on!

171
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:42,181
We're used to it out here.

172
00:08:48,189 --> 00:08:49,456
Hey, do you want to get out of here?

173
00:08:49,558 --> 00:08:51,424
I thought you'd never ask.

174
00:08:51,526 --> 00:08:52,826
Come on.

175
00:08:52,927 --> 00:08:54,193
I know the way.

176
00:09:06,408 --> 00:09:08,040
We lost them.

177
00:09:08,687 --> 00:09:11,503
Oh, I have never done
anything like this before.

178
00:09:11,504 --> 00:09:12,545
Come here.

179
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:36,035

180
00:09:49,599 --> 00:09:51,099
Got her watch, but I couldn't crack it.

181
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,576
Oh, great.

182
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:05,179
- Is she gagged?
- Yeah.

183
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,639
Think you've got a screamer, Bradley.

184
00:10:12,675 --> 00:10:13,841
I hope not.

185
00:10:38,201 --> 00:10:39,433
Just keep it moving tonight.

186
00:10:39,468 --> 00:10:40,868
Sure thing, Jimmy.

187
00:10:42,972 --> 00:10:44,972
- Food's almost ready.
- Thanks, Ma.

188
00:10:45,008 --> 00:10:46,707
Did you finish your math problems?

189
00:10:46,742 --> 00:10:48,075
I already checked his answers.

190
00:10:48,111 --> 00:10:49,277
He only missed one.

191
00:10:52,982 --> 00:10:54,148
Nice going.

192
00:11:47,803 --> 00:11:49,370
You cogs.

193
00:11:49,405 --> 00:11:51,272
You all think I'm gonna rape you.

194
00:11:51,307 --> 00:11:54,275
Well, let me tell you something.

195
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,677
I don't want your greenback disease.

196
00:12:04,053 --> 00:12:07,121
You had a high-tech data
guard on your watch.

197
00:12:07,156 --> 00:12:10,824
But I still got your
emergency contact number...

198
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,060
Mom.

199
00:12:13,096 --> 00:12:15,296
So now I just need one
more thing from you...

200
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:18,366
Your name.

201
00:12:20,903 --> 00:12:22,336
Amani.

202
00:12:24,807 --> 00:12:26,340
Amani Merced.

203
00:12:28,844 --> 00:12:30,011
Okay, Amani.

204
00:12:52,468 --> 00:12:56,323
There's one small
problem, Deputy Morse.

205
00:12:56,324 --> 00:12:57,905
No one in the history of Spiga

206
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:02,076
has ever requested a transfer
from Milwaukee to Sioux Falls.

207
00:13:02,111 --> 00:13:04,811
It's about quality of life.

208
00:13:04,847 --> 00:13:07,114
It's jumping off the corporate ladder.

209
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,350
Makes me think you're cracking up.

210
00:13:09,385 --> 00:13:11,118
And that...

211
00:13:11,154 --> 00:13:13,454
that'd be a big problem.

212
00:13:13,489 --> 00:13:17,191
My wife would prefer a smaller town.

213
00:13:17,226 --> 00:13:18,459
You just had a kid, right?

214
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,996
Mine are almost grown.

215
00:13:23,032 --> 00:13:25,199
I remember when they were
just little bundles of meat,

216
00:13:25,234 --> 00:13:27,601
screaming till I thought I'd go crazy.

217
00:13:29,238 --> 00:13:30,538
That's what kids do.

218
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:36,177
You ever worry you just might snap?

219
00:13:36,212 --> 00:13:37,545
No.

220
00:13:39,648 --> 00:13:43,117
I heard that about you Oil War vets.

221
00:13:43,152 --> 00:13:46,353
You're brutal and efficient.

222
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:49,056
But then you start to see
threats where there aren't any.

223
00:13:51,327 --> 00:13:53,994
Is that what happened
with Captain Berman?

224
00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:56,797
You got overzealous maintaining
security in your unit,

225
00:13:56,832 --> 00:13:59,032
and you just snapped?

226
00:13:59,068 --> 00:14:01,435
I was cleared to return
to my full duties.

227
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:04,305
And no one has ever
questioned my loyalty.

228
00:14:06,175 --> 00:14:08,542
Certainly not Elizabeth Krauss.

229
00:14:08,578 --> 00:14:11,479
You're one of the best
interrogators I've ever seen.

230
00:14:13,882 --> 00:14:17,918
But there's no Quiet Room
in Sioux Falls, is there?

231
00:14:17,953 --> 00:14:20,287
It'd be a waste of your
talents, don't you think?

232
00:14:20,323 --> 00:14:22,189
I have other talents.

233
00:14:22,574 --> 00:14:25,126
What we do in this room, Julian...

234
00:14:25,161 --> 00:14:27,094
it's bloody, thankless.

235
00:14:28,431 --> 00:14:30,464
But we do it for the good of the company.

236
00:14:31,867 --> 00:14:35,136
All due respect, sir...

237
00:14:35,171 --> 00:14:37,505
I think I've done enough.

238
00:14:40,976 --> 00:14:43,010
Chief Connor, there's a 12-01.

239
00:14:43,045 --> 00:14:45,078
You're both needed, now.

240
00:14:48,384 --> 00:14:50,484
This was your daughter ten minutes ago.

241
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,286
- Is she okay?
- For now.

242
00:14:52,321 --> 00:14:55,489
For $50,000 blackcoin,
she stays that way.

243
00:14:55,525 --> 00:14:57,924
We're lucky he asked
for a ransom... pay it.

244
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,717
We'll initiate containment-recovery
protocol immediately.

245
00:15:00,917 --> 00:15:01,595
Wait.

246
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,164
I'm sending an account number.

247
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,931
We'll put a tracker on the transfer.

248
00:15:04,967 --> 00:15:06,400
When he opens the receipt,
we'll have a location.

249
00:15:06,435 --> 00:15:08,101
This isn't a corporate abduction.

250
00:15:08,137 --> 00:15:09,537
A CNR isn't necessary.

251
00:15:09,572 --> 00:15:11,238
You have 20 minutes.

252
00:15:11,274 --> 00:15:13,240
This looks like a low-level
grab-and-bag, sir.

253
00:15:13,276 --> 00:15:14,441
Can't take the risk.

254
00:15:14,477 --> 00:15:15,976
CNR is in effect now.

255
00:15:16,011 --> 00:15:17,545
Assemble the tactical team...

256
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,012
immediately.

257
00:15:19,048 --> 00:15:20,447
We don't get the money,

258
00:15:20,483 --> 00:15:22,316
bad things start happening to Amani.

259
00:15:22,351 --> 00:15:24,652
Got it?

260
00:15:24,687 --> 00:15:26,387
Just authorize the transfer.

261
00:15:28,157 --> 00:15:29,590
Are you listening?

262
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,024
Elizabeth.

263
00:15:32,562 --> 00:15:33,927
Hey.

264
00:15:33,962 --> 00:15:35,128
You can send the money,

265
00:15:35,164 --> 00:15:36,597
or we can escalate this thing.

266
00:15:40,936 --> 00:15:42,536
No.

267
00:15:42,572 --> 00:15:43,970
I'm not paying.

268
00:15:49,709 --> 00:15:51,503
- She said no.
- What?!

269
00:15:51,504 --> 00:15:53,517
- She said no.
- Her mom said no?

270
00:15:53,518 --> 00:15:55,048
Goddamn suits...

271
00:15:55,049 --> 00:15:57,282
care more about money
than their own kids.

272
00:15:58,151 --> 00:15:59,450
Get the kit.

273
00:16:04,357 --> 00:16:05,924
When a senior executive

274
00:16:06,026 --> 00:16:08,927
or their immediate family is abducted,

275
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:10,195
the protocol's clear.

276
00:16:10,297 --> 00:16:11,496
You heard Julian.

277
00:16:11,599 --> 00:16:13,364
This is not a corporate kidnapping.

278
00:16:13,467 --> 00:16:16,335
You don't get to change the rules
just because it's your daughter.

279
00:16:16,336 --> 00:16:18,036
He called her Amani.

280
00:16:18,138 --> 00:16:19,671
She lied to protect her identity.

281
00:16:19,773 --> 00:16:22,074
- He did, sir.
- I don't care what he said.

282
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,143
If you'd authorized payment,

283
00:16:25,245 --> 00:16:26,478
the tac team would be en route.

284
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,146
And Laura would end up dead.

285
00:16:28,248 --> 00:16:29,280
You don't know that.

286
00:16:29,382 --> 00:16:30,616
The priority for a CNR

287
00:16:30,718 --> 00:16:33,051
is to protect corporate
intellectual property,

288
00:16:33,153 --> 00:16:35,988
not save the lives of kidnapping victims.

289
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:38,456
We'll do our best to make
sure she comes home safe.

290
00:16:40,027 --> 00:16:41,893
No.

291
00:16:41,996 --> 00:16:43,561
I will.

292
00:16:43,664 --> 00:16:46,031
I'm overriding you.

293
00:16:46,133 --> 00:16:47,198
You have a problem with that,

294
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,667
take it up with the fucking Board.

295
00:16:56,176 --> 00:16:58,209
The Board will side with Connor.

296
00:16:58,311 --> 00:16:59,945
Get me assigned to the team.

297
00:17:00,047 --> 00:17:01,613
I'll do everything in my
power to keep her safe.

298
00:17:01,715 --> 00:17:03,048
That's not enough.

299
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,650
Laura's watch was deactivated

300
00:17:04,752 --> 00:17:06,284
outside the Red Zone club.

301
00:17:06,386 --> 00:17:10,122
You have to find her before Spiga does.

302
00:17:10,223 --> 00:17:13,224
You're asking me to openly
defy chain of command?

303
00:17:13,326 --> 00:17:14,726
When you helped me in the past,

304
00:17:14,828 --> 00:17:17,529
I made sure that you were rewarded.

305
00:17:17,631 --> 00:17:20,498
Connor doesn't want to
grant your transfer.

306
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,134
I can force his hand.

307
00:17:24,304 --> 00:17:26,471
Julian, I don't even want to imagine

308
00:17:26,573 --> 00:17:29,207
what they're doing to Laura right now.

309
00:17:29,309 --> 00:17:32,044
But it'll be worse if you don't
get there before Connor.

310
00:17:35,816 --> 00:17:37,749
Stall him as long as you can.

311
00:17:37,851 --> 00:17:39,718
If the kidnappers don't
realize who she is,

312
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,219
we have a chance.

313
00:17:43,623 --> 00:17:45,123
What are you doing?

314
00:17:45,225 --> 00:17:46,424
What is that for?

315
00:17:46,526 --> 00:17:48,126
Just remember this is your mom's fault.

316
00:17:48,228 --> 00:17:49,194
No, no.

317
00:17:49,296 --> 00:17:50,461
My mom wouldn't do...

318
00:17:50,564 --> 00:17:51,663
look, we have the money.

319
00:17:51,765 --> 00:17:52,964
There's been a mistake.

320
00:17:53,067 --> 00:17:53,965
Don't forget the camera.

321
00:17:54,068 --> 00:17:55,167
No, please, just...

322
00:17:55,268 --> 00:17:56,267
just let me talk to her.

323
00:17:56,369 --> 00:17:57,468
Just let me talk to her, please!

324
00:17:57,571 --> 00:17:59,137
Don't hurt me! No, please!

325
00:18:06,213 --> 00:18:07,545
- You hold her.
- What?

326
00:18:07,647 --> 00:18:09,447
- No, I'll do it.
- I got it.

327
00:18:09,549 --> 00:18:12,718
- You sure?
- Yes, Kim, I'm sure.

328
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:15,253
No!

329
00:18:34,742 --> 00:18:36,608
- What the fuck?!
- Jesus.

330
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:38,711
This is why I usually do it...
you have to keep it on the ear.

331
00:18:38,712 --> 00:18:40,145
- I am.
- The hard part.

332
00:18:45,185 --> 00:18:46,317
You got to be kidding me.

333
00:18:53,393 --> 00:18:54,659
Oh, God. I need to stop the bleeding.

334
00:18:57,564 --> 00:18:58,797
Everything okay in there?

335
00:18:59,648 --> 00:19:00,665
Yeah.

336
00:19:04,304 --> 00:19:05,603
Jesus.

337
00:19:09,143 --> 00:19:10,108
Are you okay?

338
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:11,442
Yeah, I'm fine.

339
00:19:11,544 --> 00:19:13,111
I've got to transfer the video,

340
00:19:13,213 --> 00:19:14,246
and I'll call Jimmy.

341
00:19:21,721 --> 00:19:23,721
Ma, go.

342
00:19:28,962 --> 00:19:30,728
Shit.

343
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:33,231
It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

344
00:19:46,446 --> 00:19:48,513
Guess the last beer's mine.

345
00:19:52,853 --> 00:19:55,753
A girl was kidnapped from the
Pocket Rocket about an hour ago.

346
00:19:55,856 --> 00:19:57,522
I don't know anything.

347
00:19:57,624 --> 00:19:59,257
We both know how this works.

348
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:02,294
They nab somebody on your
turf, you get a cut.

349
00:20:02,395 --> 00:20:04,529
Try a different answer.

350
00:20:04,631 --> 00:20:06,464
Locust Street.

351
00:20:06,566 --> 00:20:09,201
Big building on the corner of Edgecombe.

352
00:20:09,303 --> 00:20:10,936
Apartment number?

353
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:12,637
There's, like, four
different crews in there.

354
00:20:12,739 --> 00:20:13,872
I only know the building.

355
00:20:48,308 --> 00:20:50,976
There's some blood on the bear.

356
00:20:59,019 --> 00:21:00,919
I didn't want your son to see it.

357
00:21:01,021 --> 00:21:02,921
My son?

358
00:21:03,023 --> 00:21:05,690
I'm not any older than you.

359
00:21:05,792 --> 00:21:08,626
Do you have kids yet?

360
00:21:08,728 --> 00:21:10,561
Sorry, I just assumed.

361
00:21:10,663 --> 00:21:12,330
He's my nephew.

362
00:21:17,604 --> 00:21:20,705
His dad died working on
a pipeline up north.

363
00:21:24,711 --> 00:21:28,947
Then my sister was killed by some...

364
00:21:29,049 --> 00:21:31,016
joyriding suit

365
00:21:31,118 --> 00:21:33,651
in a hit-and-run.

366
00:21:33,753 --> 00:21:35,787
Flatass didn't even stop.

367
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,390
I'm sorry.

368
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:46,664
My brother...

369
00:21:46,766 --> 00:21:48,666
doesn't know to stay on the cartilage.

370
00:21:50,003 --> 00:21:52,037
My other ear gets cut off,

371
00:21:52,139 --> 00:21:53,704
it better be by you.

372
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,947
You should think about nursing school.

373
00:22:02,049 --> 00:22:04,950
- You'd be good.
- Really?

374
00:22:06,753 --> 00:22:10,055
Which corporate nursing school
would you suggest I go to?

375
00:22:10,157 --> 00:22:13,124
No, I didn't mean it like that.

376
00:22:15,595 --> 00:22:19,364
This is probably six months' rent.

377
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,767
This is how we get by.

378
00:22:28,508 --> 00:22:30,475
Food's ready.

379
00:22:35,748 --> 00:22:37,615
Grab my paper for me.

380
00:22:45,692 --> 00:22:46,958
What is it?

381
00:22:50,373 --> 00:22:51,863
Jesus.

382
00:22:55,222 --> 00:22:56,834
We hit the goddamn jackpot.

383
00:22:57,106 --> 00:23:00,605
Bradley, don't send that video yet.

384
00:23:06,245 --> 00:23:07,320
I...

385
00:23:23,096 --> 00:23:25,830
She wasn't kidnapped by Inazagi.

386
00:23:25,932 --> 00:23:28,099
They realize who she is,
that's who they'll sell her to.

387
00:23:28,201 --> 00:23:29,834
She has no corporate I.P.

388
00:23:29,936 --> 00:23:31,636
But you do.

389
00:23:31,738 --> 00:23:33,838
And they could use her to get to you.

390
00:23:36,009 --> 00:23:37,642
Your daughter's ransom

391
00:23:37,744 --> 00:23:39,911
is now 5 million blackcoin, Mrs. Krauss.

392
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:48,153
Could you turn that off, please?

393
00:23:48,255 --> 00:23:49,554
You have 20 minutes.

394
00:23:49,656 --> 00:23:50,755
If you don't pay,

395
00:23:50,857 --> 00:23:51,956
Inazagi will.

396
00:23:56,063 --> 00:23:58,096
I'm sorry, Elizabeth.

397
00:23:58,326 --> 00:23:59,497
We'll do our best.

398
00:24:02,438 --> 00:24:03,901
Payment complete.

399
00:24:03,902 --> 00:24:05,850
PAYMENT COMPLETE
5,000,000 BLACK COIN TRANSFER

400
00:24:25,857 --> 00:24:27,992
CONTACT LIST: JULIAN MORSE

401
00:24:27,993 --> 00:24:29,157
Hello.

402
00:24:29,158 --> 00:24:31,358
They know who Laura is.

403
00:24:33,195 --> 00:24:35,562
Has Connor deployed the team?

404
00:24:35,598 --> 00:24:37,064
Gates authorized the payments.

405
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,034
They have her location.

406
00:24:42,571 --> 00:24:44,371
But I don't know where she is.

407
00:24:46,976 --> 00:24:49,376
I'm closing in on her now.

408
00:25:12,334 --> 00:25:13,534
No!

409
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:20,407
You're never gonna believe it.

410
00:25:20,442 --> 00:25:22,209
The girl we nabbed...

411
00:25:22,244 --> 00:25:24,611
her mom is the CEO of Spiga.

412
00:25:24,647 --> 00:25:27,081
Don't want you to get dehydrated.

413
00:25:28,484 --> 00:25:30,450
Don't worry.

414
00:25:30,486 --> 00:25:32,219
Spiga paid.

415
00:25:32,254 --> 00:25:33,988
We got 5 million for it...

416
00:25:34,023 --> 00:25:36,323
Looks like you're going home soon.

417
00:25:36,358 --> 00:25:38,292
You did what?

418
00:25:38,327 --> 00:25:40,627
Shit.

419
00:25:40,663 --> 00:25:44,364
We caught a break and we took it.

420
00:25:46,035 --> 00:25:48,368
You think this is a good thing?

421
00:25:48,404 --> 00:25:49,904
You're an idiot.

422
00:25:49,939 --> 00:25:51,371
Come on, Jimmy.

423
00:25:51,407 --> 00:25:54,274
You can't just grab
someone that high up.

424
00:26:05,421 --> 00:26:06,653
This is huge.

425
00:26:06,689 --> 00:26:09,123
We took a risk, and it paid off.

426
00:26:09,158 --> 00:26:11,625
Reverse course.

427
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,728
It's 5 million blackcoin, Jimmy.

428
00:26:13,763 --> 00:26:15,229
We can retire on this bitch.

429
00:26:15,264 --> 00:26:16,630
There you are.

430
00:26:16,665 --> 00:26:18,099
You think you're gonna retire?

431
00:26:18,134 --> 00:26:20,331
You're gonna get incinerated
down at the Firemouth

432
00:26:20,332 --> 00:26:22,469
and end up in cut-rate cement.

433
00:26:25,708 --> 00:26:27,507
Understand the problem...

434
00:26:27,543 --> 00:26:29,509
Get the girl back, and
we're all we're all rich.

435
00:26:29,545 --> 00:26:31,445
Spiga's coming, and they're
gonna kill all of us!

436
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,114
But we've got the girl.

437
00:26:33,149 --> 00:26:34,949
They don't give a shit
if the girl dies too!

438
00:26:34,984 --> 00:26:37,551
It's a goddamn corporate policy!

439
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:40,487
It doesn't make any sense.

440
00:26:40,882 --> 00:26:42,389
Why would they pay...

441
00:26:43,107 --> 00:26:44,092
WIRE TRANSFER RECEIVED
5,000,000 BLACKCOIN

442
00:26:44,093 --> 00:26:46,260
The money is here, Jimmy.

443
00:26:46,295 --> 00:26:48,095
If they were gonna kill us,

444
00:26:48,131 --> 00:26:49,363
they wouldn't have paid.

445
00:26:54,137 --> 00:26:56,270
All the corporations have
bounty hunters out there...

446
00:27:00,176 --> 00:27:02,643
Spiga thinks she's been
nabbed by a competitor.

447
00:27:02,678 --> 00:27:04,211
They'll pay ten times that!

448
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:06,647
And still burn this place down.

449
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:13,220
Someone that big, they pay,

450
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:15,089
and then they take out everyone

451
00:27:15,124 --> 00:27:17,491
just to protect their
intellectual property.

452
00:27:18,828 --> 00:27:21,428
Okay, so what do we do then, Jimmy?

453
00:27:22,585 --> 00:27:25,099
What do we do?

454
00:27:25,134 --> 00:27:26,533
Only thing that'll stop them

455
00:27:26,568 --> 00:27:28,402
is if they're sure the girl is dead.

456
00:27:52,661 --> 00:27:55,062
Get your things, kill the
girl, and get the hell out.

457
00:27:55,097 --> 00:27:57,031
They said not to kill anyone.

458
00:27:57,066 --> 00:27:58,365
I'm telling you...

459
00:28:07,509 --> 00:28:08,675
No, no, Jimmy.

460
00:28:08,711 --> 00:28:10,644
This is our payday.

461
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:12,346
Jimmy...

462
00:28:12,381 --> 00:28:14,514
Let's go. Now.

463
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:15,716
I'll be back.

464
00:28:19,121 --> 00:28:20,354
What are we gonna do?

465
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:25,659
Kim, get your stuff. You heard him.

466
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,100
No, Ma, leave that.

467
00:28:33,135 --> 00:28:35,236
I'm not leaving this behind
if we're not coming back.

468
00:28:35,271 --> 00:28:37,137
We're coming back, all right?

469
00:28:39,842 --> 00:28:42,309
But for now, we do what Jimmy says.

470
00:28:59,661 --> 00:29:02,162
Shut up.

471
00:29:05,902 --> 00:29:08,335
Yeah, get all that... put it in here.

472
00:29:15,778 --> 00:29:17,778
All right. Kim?

473
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:28,588
I'll take care of it, all right?

474
00:29:28,624 --> 00:29:30,424
Get him out of here first.

475
00:29:35,531 --> 00:29:38,632
Kim, let's go!

476
00:29:38,667 --> 00:29:39,866
Kim?

477
00:29:41,203 --> 00:29:42,369
Kim.

478
00:30:06,695 --> 00:30:08,562
You're safe.

479
00:30:08,597 --> 00:30:11,231
No one's gonna hurt you.

480
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,968
I'm Julian.

481
00:30:14,003 --> 00:30:15,702
Your mother sent me to bring you home.

482
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:29,283
Okay?

483
00:30:29,318 --> 00:30:30,584
We have to move quickly.

484
00:30:31,063 --> 00:30:32,353
Let's go.

485
00:31:00,349 --> 00:31:01,515
Hold your fire.

486
00:31:07,723 --> 00:31:08,989
The risk is contained.

487
00:31:09,025 --> 00:31:10,924
CNR is complete.

488
00:31:13,062 --> 00:31:16,930
Status of hostiles?

489
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:23,437
I eliminated all the targets, sir.

490
00:31:30,446 --> 00:31:31,845
She needs medical attention.

491
00:31:42,391 --> 00:31:43,757
Come on.

492
00:31:48,397 --> 00:31:50,697
Hope your loyalty serves you well.

493
00:32:01,506 --> 00:32:03,975
Oh, Laura.

494
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:06,824
Oh, thank God. Thank God.

495
00:32:06,825 --> 00:32:08,324
Thank God.

496
00:32:11,463 --> 00:32:12,787
It's okay. It's okay.

497
00:32:12,788 --> 00:32:15,746
The doctor will fix everything.

498
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,390
It's gonna be okay.

499
00:32:16,403 --> 00:32:19,789
Tell me what really happened.

500
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,333
You have to understand.

501
00:32:21,334 --> 00:32:23,244
If I had paid them,

502
00:32:23,245 --> 00:32:25,158
it would've made everything
so much worse for you.

503
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:27,112
No, not me.

504
00:32:27,938 --> 00:32:31,206
Dad.

505
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:33,341
What happened to Dad?

506
00:32:33,377 --> 00:32:35,743
Sweetheart.

507
00:32:35,779 --> 00:32:37,412
You know what happened.

508
00:32:37,447 --> 00:32:40,826
No, no, I know what you told me...

509
00:32:40,827 --> 00:32:43,561
that you tried everything to save him,

510
00:32:43,597 --> 00:32:47,164
but the rescue team
couldn't make it in time.

511
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,800
That's right.

512
00:32:51,337 --> 00:32:54,939
You are such a liar.

513
00:32:54,975 --> 00:32:58,810
Listen, you have had a very
traumatizing experience.

514
00:32:58,845 --> 00:33:01,045
Even the kidnappers seemed to know

515
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,581
how Spiga deals with abductions.

516
00:33:03,617 --> 00:33:06,050
Maybe the two of you
should speak privately.

517
00:33:06,085 --> 00:33:07,485
Oh, why?

518
00:33:07,521 --> 00:33:10,087
So that she can sell me
more of her bullshit?

519
00:33:10,123 --> 00:33:11,823
Laura...

520
00:33:11,858 --> 00:33:14,893
If the company saved people,

521
00:33:14,928 --> 00:33:18,195
then you wouldn't have had
to send him to save me.

522
00:33:22,168 --> 00:33:24,468
All these years,

523
00:33:24,504 --> 00:33:28,006
pretending you were so devastated

524
00:33:28,041 --> 00:33:30,374
they couldn't get to him in time.

525
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:32,176
I was devastated.

526
00:33:32,211 --> 00:33:36,180
Did you really think that
I would never find out?

527
00:33:36,215 --> 00:33:37,882
You were only a child...

528
00:33:37,918 --> 00:33:39,316
You owe me the truth!

529
00:33:39,352 --> 00:33:43,187
I owe you? I risked everything for you.

530
00:33:44,078 --> 00:33:46,457
Not just my career, but my life.

531
00:33:46,492 --> 00:33:49,060
And I did it to save you.

532
00:33:50,997 --> 00:33:53,898
Which proves you could've
saved Dad if you wanted to.

533
00:33:59,347 --> 00:34:01,305
The doctor is waiting.

534
00:34:04,277 --> 00:34:07,411
Why don't we have her look at your ear?

535
00:34:20,293 --> 00:34:21,926
You could've told her the truth.

536
00:34:25,298 --> 00:34:27,065
She's safer this way.

537
00:34:29,903 --> 00:34:32,236
Besides, she adored Paul,

538
00:34:32,271 --> 00:34:34,472
and it's better that she hate me

539
00:34:34,507 --> 00:34:36,608
than hate him.

540
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:40,511
I'm glad she's home.

541
00:34:42,649 --> 00:34:45,249
Thanks.

542
00:34:45,284 --> 00:34:47,619
And thank you for your
help with the transfer.

543
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:56,752
I did everything I could.

544
00:34:56,753 --> 00:34:59,041
Gates vetoed it.

545
00:34:59,042 --> 00:35:01,848
Connor's moving up the ladder,

546
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:06,547
and when he goes, I'll make
sure that you get his position.

547
00:35:06,548 --> 00:35:08,472
I never wanted his position.

548
00:35:15,749 --> 00:35:18,683
You're the only one I can trust.

549
00:35:29,162 --> 00:35:30,628
Can you tell me where it hurts?

550
00:35:32,331 --> 00:35:35,266
My ear.

551
00:35:35,301 --> 00:35:37,168
My arm.

552
00:35:37,203 --> 00:35:40,071
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

553
00:35:40,106 --> 00:35:42,306
No need to apologize.

554
00:35:45,061 --> 00:35:45,643
It's okay.

555
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:47,244
Sorry, I'm sorry.

556
00:35:56,156 --> 00:35:59,290
This...

557
00:35:59,325 --> 00:36:01,993
is the best part of the job.

558
00:36:11,705 --> 00:36:13,370
You can't convince me

559
00:36:13,406 --> 00:36:15,639
that I don't have the
best job in the world.

560
00:36:17,677 --> 00:36:20,044
See?

561
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,645
It's like it never happened.

562
00:36:31,024 --> 00:36:32,623
Warning: that address is located

563
00:36:32,658 --> 00:36:35,093
outside of a secure corporate area.

564
00:36:35,636 --> 00:36:36,703
Do you accept?

565
00:36:36,762 --> 00:36:38,183
UNSECURE AREA CONFIRMATION REQUIRED:
2714 CENTER STREET

566
00:36:38,184 --> 00:36:39,296
Do you accept?

567
00:36:40,433 --> 00:36:41,599
- Do you accept?
- Yes.

568
00:36:51,872 --> 00:36:53,139
An exit strategy?

569
00:36:55,577 --> 00:36:58,811
To get Elena out, I need to
get Inazagi's attention.

570
00:36:59,464 --> 00:37:00,446
How?

571
00:37:00,482 --> 00:37:03,717
I'm planning an operation based
on intel we got from a defector.

572
00:37:03,718 --> 00:37:06,486
This should help move up the timetable.

573
00:37:06,521 --> 00:37:07,720
You think this'll work?

574
00:37:10,492 --> 00:37:11,624
It has to.

575
00:37:19,694 --> 00:37:22,572
My dad was passed out in the hall
when I came home the other night.

576
00:37:23,405 --> 00:37:26,406
You talk to him?

577
00:37:26,441 --> 00:37:29,609
I've got nothing to say to him.

578
00:37:29,644 --> 00:37:31,277
He thinks she's dead.

579
00:37:31,313 --> 00:37:32,878
Probably better that way.

580
00:37:39,321 --> 00:37:42,892
In 24 hours, the geolocation signal
on Roger's watch will reactivate.

581
00:37:43,324 --> 00:37:46,753
It has to be in place before then so Spiga
believes it's a natural defection.

582
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:51,397
No problem.

583
00:37:51,433 --> 00:37:53,266
You have to get her out, Aaron.

584
00:37:53,301 --> 00:37:55,335
You do your part,

585
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:57,503
and I will.

586
00:37:59,774 --> 00:38:03,276
- Hey.
- Hey, how's your day going?

587
00:38:03,311 --> 00:38:04,644
I've been better.

588
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:08,281
Just... tired.

589
00:38:08,316 --> 00:38:11,417
Well, you should go home
and lay on the couch...

590
00:38:11,453 --> 00:38:14,554
watch some of those animal-clone
mash-ups or something.

591
00:38:15,698 --> 00:38:16,889
You hate that stuff.

592
00:38:16,924 --> 00:38:19,453
I know, but I'm not there.

593
00:38:19,454 --> 00:38:20,360
I have a patient.

594
00:38:20,395 --> 00:38:22,395
Your office is closed, isn't it?

595
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,630
House call.

596
00:38:23,665 --> 00:38:25,431
I'll tell you about it later.

597
00:38:25,467 --> 00:38:27,767
All right.

598
00:38:27,802 --> 00:38:29,201
You okay?

599
00:38:31,773 --> 00:38:33,606
Yes.

600
00:38:33,642 --> 00:38:34,840
I am.

601
00:38:43,785 --> 00:38:47,654
Two more... on her.

602
00:38:47,689 --> 00:38:49,489
You owe me, mooch.

603
00:38:49,524 --> 00:38:51,524
Cash.

604
00:38:56,798 --> 00:38:58,230
I'll have what they're having.

605
00:39:00,302 --> 00:39:01,901
Only take real coin, kid.

606
00:39:01,936 --> 00:39:03,903
Unload your stolen dat somewhere else.

607
00:39:03,938 --> 00:39:06,773
Come on, man.

608
00:39:06,808 --> 00:39:08,775
Belonged to a Spiga suit.

609
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:12,478
I'll give you the watch... barter system.

610
00:39:13,676 --> 00:39:15,682
Maybe we can help you out.

611
00:39:15,717 --> 00:39:17,249
With what?

612
00:39:17,285 --> 00:39:20,653
50 for the watch.

613
00:39:20,689 --> 00:39:21,987
200.

614
00:39:22,023 --> 00:39:24,324
- No way.
- How do I even know it works?

615
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:25,625
It's a gamble, I guess.

616
00:39:28,596 --> 00:39:30,763
75.

617
00:39:30,799 --> 00:39:32,865
He was gonna trade it for two shots.

618
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:36,569
Shut up.

619
00:39:36,604 --> 00:39:40,272
I bring them this, the
entire Inazagi board

620
00:39:40,308 --> 00:39:42,508
will fellate my toes.

621
00:40:01,663 --> 00:40:04,564
Hey, come on, guys,
get back to work, 'kay?

622
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:05,798
All right, man.

623
00:40:05,834 --> 00:40:08,457
Don't relax. Let's go.

624
00:40:08,458 --> 00:40:09,866
RAMPART APARTMENTS

625
00:40:13,408 --> 00:40:16,308
I don't work for you anymore.

626
00:40:16,344 --> 00:40:19,379
I know.

627
00:40:19,414 --> 00:40:20,713
Take me to the girl.

628
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:32,333

629
00:40:34,174 --> 00:40:36,620

630
00:40:36,621 --> 00:40:38,167

631
00:40:38,168 --> 00:40:38,958

632
00:40:38,959 --> 00:40:40,422

633
00:40:40,423 --> 00:40:42,200

634
00:40:42,201 --> 00:40:44,843

635
00:40:44,844 --> 00:40:45,731

636
00:40:45,732 --> 00:40:47,970

637
00:40:47,971 --> 00:40:53,504
