00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,410
-[Mrs. Palchuk] Steve, take out the trash.
-[TV chatter]

2
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,160
[Steve] I'm doing homework!

3
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,880
[Mrs. Palchuk]
I can hear the game on the TV!

4
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,260
[grunts] Fine! Stupid bag.

5
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:30,170
Mom...

6
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,220
[mocking] Homework. I'll do it. Okay.

7
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,300
-Palchuk...
-[grunts]

8
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,130
...your mother doesn't deserve
that attitude.

9
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,600
-[sighs] Whatever, Coach.
-Hey, this is new to both of us.

10
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,640
But just 'cause your dad's
no longer in this house

11
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,970
doesn't mean his hostility has to be.

12
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,860
Look, things are gonna be different now.

13
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,860
I'm here if you wanna hug it out.

14
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,240
Hug this.

15
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,160
-[grunts]
-Have it your way.

16
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,070
Stupid.

17
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,040
[clattering]

18
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,450
Raccoons.

-What... are you?
-[growling]

[pants]

35
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,760
Up high, Pal-champ!
That goal you scored in the game...

36
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,600
Okay, let's talk about it later.

37
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,250
-[boy] Think so?
-[girl] Should work out.

38
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,460
[Coach Lawrence]
So you cheaters don't turn in a fake,

39
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:03,090
personalize your babies
to begin the joy of parenting.

40
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,680
[Darci] I'm kinda worried.

41
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:10,280
Toby, I really need to pass this class,
or else I lose my mascot position.

42
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,400
Don't worry. We're Team Darby.

43
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,520
We got this. I'm great with kids.

44
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,450
[grunts]

45
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,080
Good of you to join us, Palchuk.

46
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,580
Sorry I'm, uh, late, Coach.
Things got a little weird.

47
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,250
It's about to get weirder.

48
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,380
You're raising a baby with Pepperjack.

49
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,740
[both] What?

50
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:28,990
Ugh!

51
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,910
-[grunts]
-Hey, Pepperjack, listen.

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,630
Didn't you say one time,
like, you saw, uh, monsters?

53
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:39,920
If you're gonna shove me in a locker,
just get it over with.

54
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:43,520
What are you doing?
Seriously, I need to talk to you.

55
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,850
-Palchuk!
-What?

56
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:48,430
I was just talking about the assignment
with my new partner.

57
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,530
[chuckles] Right, buddy?

58
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,850
Just because we share a roof doesn't mean
you can waltz in late like that.

59
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,230
-Won't let it happen again, Coach.
-Good.

60
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,530
Seriously--

61
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,230
By the way, stopping by the store later.

62
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,320
Want me to pick up more of those
extra-strength pimple pads that you use?

63
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,290
-[clears throat]
-[chuckling]

64
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:07,670
Yeah, that'd be great. Bye, Coach.

65
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,370
Wait. Coach Lawrence is dating your mom?

66
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,920
If one word ever slips your lips,

67
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,960
I swear you'll spend
the rest of your life in there.

68
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,670
Never mind.

69
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,350
I need to know, are monsters real?

70
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,440
[bell ringing]

71
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:28,260
I'm coming to your house.
I need to show you something.

72
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,480
But... what do we name our baby?

73
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,890
[Steve] I don't give a flip!

74
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,530
-[grunts]
-[thuds]

75
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,070
Oopsie.

76
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,270
My mistake.

77
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,360
You think I am not wise
to your schemes, impure?

78
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,950
After a thousand years at Gunmar's side,
you will not replace me as counsel.

79
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,960
Oh, really?
Because I believe I already have.

80
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,000
And once the vicious one realizes

81
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,680
he has no further use
for an old, blind troll...

82
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,970
I-- Well...

83
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:08,480
Well, what? You know I can't see.

84
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,650
Oh. I moved my thumb across my throat.

85
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:17,950
-It is, as we say, a killing motion.
-You dare threaten me?

86
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:21,190
When I inform my Dark Lord
of this treachery,

87
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,490
it will be he who will kill you.

88
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:29,030
And let me be the first to say,
I will enjoy every minute of--

89
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:33,000
Oh. You're no longer here, are you?

90
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,500
I am no longer safe here.
I must leave this place at once.

91
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:43,000
Okay, Flip, here are some
ground rules to my room.

92
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,380
-No crying, no making messes...
-[doorbell rings]

93
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,640
...and definitely no--

94
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,900
[Mrs. Pepperjack] Eli, you have a visitor.
Shall I add another table setting?

95
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,510
-No, Mom, he's just here for school.
-It's really no bother.

96
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,020
It's great to finally meet
a friend of yours.

97
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:00,200
He's not a friend!
Just send him to my room!

98
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,310
[Mrs. Pepperjack shouting]
Elijah Leslie Pepperjack!

99
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,320
Send him to my room, please.

100
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,830
-[grunts]
-[grunts]

101
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,460
[chuckles]
"Leslie"? Guess we both have a secret.

102
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,170
So I know us being partners isn't ideal,

103
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,120
but I worked out a parenting schedule
to limit our interaction.

104
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,380
Shut up, Pepperjack.

105
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,970
And tell me...

106
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,210
what this is.

107
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,090
Ah!

108
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,560
[growling]

109
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,830
-[growls]
-[screaming]

110
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,500
[glass breaking]

111
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,790
-[beeping]
-[woman] "C" is for "cow."

112
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,010
"Z" is for "zebra."

113
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:04,930
-You... You caught one?
-Caught what? Do you know what this is?

114
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,470
I'm not super smart like you,
but this isn't normal, right?

115
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,630
[chuckles]

116
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,230
-You caught one! Incredible!
-"P" is for "porcupine."

117
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:15,100
-"D" is for "dog."
-Okay, yeah, so you've seen one of these?

118
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,310
-[Eli] It's a creeper.
-[Steve] Creeper?

119
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:21,560
Things that creep in the dark.
Monsters, stone creatures, shape shifters.

120
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:22,610
[gasps]

121
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,490
[stutters] But monsters aren't real.

122
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,200
You're freaking me out, okay?
Tell me what's going on.

123
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,940
Are you sure you wanna know?

124
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:34,110
Once you do, there's no going back.

125
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,450
Huh?

126
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:46,170
For years, I suspected,
and for years, I waited... patiently.

127
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:50,340
Then, on one fateful night, I saw them.

128
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,310
[screaming]

129
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,060
[growling]

130
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,350
Saw what?

131
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,610
Arcadia is a hotbed
for supernatural activity.

132
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:04,490
Some confirmed, some I've yet
to scratch the surface of.

133
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:09,370
Yes. Right now,
I've got more questions than answers.

134
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:13,960
But now that we have proof,
so many possibilities are open to us.

135
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,660
What? [stutters] Are you kidding me?

136
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,660
This is nuts-oid.
Why-- why haven't you told anybody?

137
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,050
I did. You shoved me into a locker.

138
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,750
There's a whole other world
beneath our feet

139
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,300
we know nothing about.

140
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,550
-Creatures living in shadow...
-[growls]

141
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,670
...monsters living amongst us.

142
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,270
But what do they want?

143
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,050
-Are they friends?
-Or... not friends?

144
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,350
Whatever they are,

145
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:41,350
someone or something in Arcadia
is at the center of this, covering it up.

146
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,780
Why does no one know?
Who's hiding the creepers from the world?

147
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,780
Whoever it is, they gotta be stopped,

148
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,950
before these things eat our faces
or something.

149
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,330
[munching]

150
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,110
[groans]

151
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,580
Who's behind this?

152
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,490
[woman] J... I... M.

153
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,500
-No, it can't be.
-There could be other Jims.

154
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,870
[chuckles]

155
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,380
-"L" is for "lake."
-Jim Lake?

156
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,500
Jim Lake's behind all this?

157
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:16,380
-No, no, that doesn't make any sense.
-It makes perfect sense.

158
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:20,640
My nemesis wants to destroy the world.

159
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:21,900
[Fragwa chuckles]

160
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:26,560
[Eli] I don't know, Steve.
I don't like any of this.

161
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,150
I've never stolen anything.

162
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:31,900
Aw, grow a pair, Pepperjack.
We're not stealing your mom's car.

163
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:35,790
We're borrowing it for an emergency.
I can't fit the four of us on my Vespa.

164
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:38,160
I just can't believe
Jim is behind all this.

165
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,530
 He's such a good guy.

166
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,630
[scoffs] Mustache back there
told us all we needed to know.

167
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:47,380
Jim is a shape-shifter
that's leading a creeper army.

168
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,170
He's a maniac that's gotta be stopped.

169
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,420
-[Eli] But why?
-[mumbles]

170
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,510
[woman] Kill Jim. Kill Jim.

171
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:57,800
Jim would never hurt a soul.

We're gonna die!

340
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:17,090
Get a hold of yourself, Steve!
We're the Creepslayerz!

341
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,810
We gotta slay some creeps!

342
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:23,020
Now, go clean yourself up.
I'll find a way to handle Jim... somehow.

343
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:25,760
-[water running]
-[grunts]

344
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,030
Come on, Steve, get it together.

-[Gruesome grunts]
-[gasps]

346
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:35,830
[softly] No, not again, no.

347
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,240
Not that thing again.

348
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,280
-[bangs]
-[gasps]

349
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,370
-[Jim] I know you're still here.
-Jim?

00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:42,280
-[banging]
-[shrieks]

351
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:44,840
[Jim] I know you're hungry,
but you have to leave.

352
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,790
I will protect Arcadia.

355
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,670
[Jim] For the glory of Merlin,
Daylight is mine to command!

356
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,720
[shuddering]

357
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,590
Jim's a... good guy?

-[Gruesome grunting]

359

[grunts]

362
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,540
There's too many bystanders here.
Need to evacuate.

363
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:21,490
[alarm blares]

364
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,540
-[woman on PA] This is not a test.
-What was that?

365
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,420
Please remain calm
and evacuate the building.

366
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,750
Think, Eli. Think.

367
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:30,450
If the Last Resort didn't get rid
of Creeper Jim, how do you stop him?

368
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,670
Why are you talking to yourself?
You're Elijah Leslie Pepperjack.

369
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,500
You're a Creepslayer. Act like it.

370
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:40,460
Sorry, Creeper Jim. Time to knock you out.

371
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:43,970
-But Toby will never let us use his baby.
-Don't take this the wrong way.

372
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,940
It's just a bag of flour.

373
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:50,110
I'm telling you, it's the only way
to get rid of that gruesome. Come on.

374
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:52,650
[coughing]

375
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,940
To think we were about to take him down...

376
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,570
Oh, no. Eli.

377
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:59,070
-Tobes, where are you?
-[Toby] Did you get it?

378
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,530
[Eli grunts]

379
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:02,320
Stop.

380
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,660
Something happened in the bathroom.

381
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,120
Isn't this something
you should keep to yourself?

382
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,830
No! I think we got it wrong, Eli.

383
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,710
Jim Lake... [retches]

384
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,210
is a... [gags]

385
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,290
good guy.

386
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,090
I don't understand.
We saw him with the monsters.

387
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:21,510
I don't know what's going on,
and I don't even know who or what Jim is,

388
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:24,050
but I think it's pretty clear
we're in way over our heads here.

389
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,440
Maybe you're right.

390
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:28,390
Let's get outta here
before anything else weird happens.

391
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,770
You know what, Pepperbuddy?

392
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:32,930
From now on, I should probably
think a little before I act.

393
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,600
And I should think twice
before knocking out a classmate

394
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:38,270
with a medieval mace
without knowing all the facts.

395
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,150
[laughter]

396
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:42,440

[screaming]

398
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:51,330
Oh, my gosh. There's no way out.
It's gonna eat our faces.

399
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,630
Why does this keep happening to us?

400
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:54,970
[chomps]

401
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,250
What do we do?

402
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,800
-We need flour. We need Flip.
-You brought him!

403
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,670
You said the assignment
was important to you.

404
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,430
-I shouldered the load.
-[Gruesome chewing]

405
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,300
Shall we do this together, partner?

406
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,810
-[Jim] Tobes, where is he?
-On three.

407
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,190
-One.
-Two.

408
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,440
[both] Three!

409
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,810
[groans]

410
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,240
No!

411
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,370
Eli, we did it!

412
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:22,830
[laughter]

413
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,730
We did it!

414
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:27,960
-[sings] Oh, yeah. We did it. Uh-huh.
-[singsong] I did it. I did it.

415
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,000
[grunts]

416
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,170

[both mimic explosion]

418
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:35,250
I'm Steve. I did it. I'm so good.

419
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:38,120
-Oh, yeah, all right. Uh-huh.
-I'm talented, I'm good. Look at me.

420
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:42,630
-Thanks for the ride.
-That's what Creepslayerz do.

421
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,560
You know, Steve,

422
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:46,300
no matter what everyone else thinks,
you're not a bad guy.

423
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:48,730
Neither are you... Leslie. [chuckles]

424
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:52,110
I kid. Don't worry,
your secret's safe with me.

425
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,770
And I won't tell anyone about Coach.

426
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,680
I appreciate that. [sighs]

427
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:58,890
-So the adventure's over.
-For tonight.

428
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,940
Arcadia is still in danger.
Jim might need us.

429
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:04,120
I can't wait to rub it in his face!

430
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:08,030
After we figure out
what's really going on.

431
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,210
Good idea. Think before we act,
operate from the shadows,

432
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,920
and strike when Arcadia needs us.

433
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,550
Like secret superheroes. I can dig that.

434
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:19,050
[chuckles] Stay safe, Eli.

435
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:21,970
Does this mean we're friends
and you'll be nice to me at school?

436
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:22,890
[grunts]

437
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,880
Sorry. Gotta keep our cover.

438
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,550
Later, buttsnack.

439
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:29,730
You're still a turd!

00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,010
[Mrs. Pepperjack]
Eli, were you just on a motorcycle?

441
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,180
It's a Vespa, Mom. Now, go to bed!

-I'm sorry, Mom.
