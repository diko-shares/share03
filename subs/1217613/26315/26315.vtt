1
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,515
Let's be clear about this.

2
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:06,119
we should be focusing on finding
a blood substitute.

3
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,287
we already touched that point.

4
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,210
with little or no population remaining
to sustain industry,

5
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:40,839
other third world countries throughout asia
have also been encouraged...

6
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,677
southbound express departing platform C.

7
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:51,725
AB.

8
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:37,682
All the material in this meeting
is classified.

9
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,226
Commissioner.

10
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:43,730
Death Row Inmate 4705B was a vampire

11
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:47,984
selected for a month-long study
on the effects of blood deprivation.

12
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,027
What?

13
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:52,113
A complete lack of human blood
over this period of time

14
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,742
resulted in a massive deterioration
of the frontal lobe.

15
00:08:56,619 --> 00:09:00,497
The first signs of physical deformities
began with elongated ears.

16
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:03,667
Mental functions such as logic, emotion,

17
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:07,045
most parts of speech,
then terminated much faster

18
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:10,340
than you or your team
originally speculated, Doctors.

19
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:13,635
Out on the streets,
these creatures, these subsiders,

20
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,804
are becoming a real problem.

21
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,847
Gentlemen, we are starving,

22
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,641
and our latest statistics show

23
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:26,940
What we're talking about
is the extinction of the human race.

24
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,316
What we're talking about

25
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,069
is only having enough blood
to sustain our population

26
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,696
until the end of the month.

27
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,824
If a blood substitute
is not found immediately,

28
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,243
this will happen to all of us.

29
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,622
Edward?

30
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,260
Enjoy your coffee, sir.

31
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:01,308
Did I ever tell you
about my daughter, Alison?

32
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,937
In early 2008,
I was diagnosed with sarcoma.

33
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,482
The shock of finding out I had cancer
was one thing,

34
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,277
but having to tell my daughter...

35
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,112
She was devastated.

36
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:18,325
I prayed for a miracle, but I was realistic.

37
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,289
And then the world changed.

38
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,541
My prayers were answered.

39
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,960
Immortality gave me my cure,

40
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:33,506
and my daughter and I
now had all the time in the world.

41
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,512
But she saw this evolution as a disease

42
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,724
worse than any cancer.

43
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,559
She refused to turn.

44
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,355
I was a monster to her,

45
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:55,111
and she ran like so many did.

46
00:10:56,614 --> 00:11:00,116
No, we are blessed, Edward. Blessed.

47
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:05,080
And you have to stare death in the face
to truly know that.

48
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,042
We're not ready yet, Mr. Bromley.

49
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,090
Not a coffee drinker?

50
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,385
Not really.

51
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:24,057
You pity the humans, don't you?

52
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,688
Well, me, too. Me, too.

53
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,651
These are desperate times, Edward.

54
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,906
We must commence
testing the blood substitute.

55
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:45,245
It is the only way to help the human race.

56
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,501
He wants us to move ahead again,
doesn't he?

57
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:52,669
Yeah.

58
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,923
Okay. Okay.

59
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,093
Is there any change?

60
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:06,766
Haemacillin, CBC and biochemical panel,
all stable.

61
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:11,104
The substitute is working.

62
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,650
It's time to move beyond animal testing.

63
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:21,281
You know the vernon Park Cemetery
was raided by a bunch of kids last night?

64
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:27,162
They dug up a dozen graves
thinking they'd find some human blood.

65
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,915
It's nuts out there.

66
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,099
All right now, Private,

67
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,852
you may feel a slight increase
in body temperature.

68
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:54,522
That's just the Haemacillin
entering your system. It's to be expected.

69
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,691
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

70
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,286
- How do you feel?
- No change, sir.

71
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:28,014
Six-degree increase.

72
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:32,852
All right, that's slightly more accelerated
than anticipated, but you're fine.

73
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:48,201
Sixty-eight degrees and holding.

74
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,456
Okay.

75
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:58,211
- Okay, how do you feel?
- I feel fine, sir.

76
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,881
All right. All right! Shit! Shit!

77
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,427
Come on. I need 20ccs of Epimone.
Come on!

78
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,225
Hold it, hold it.

79
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,061
Just breathe. Just breathe.

80
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,315
Come on, come on, come on! Come on!

81
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,818
- Hey, hey!
- You got it?

82
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,829
violent scenes in London today
as police clashed with protesters

83
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,248
over the controversial
new blood-rationing schemes.

84
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,543
demonstrators argue
that the blood allowances are too strict,

85
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:23,963
that government bodies are failing
in their promise to find alternatives.

86
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,214
similar scenes have been occurring

87
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:29,052
across asia and the middle east
in recent times.

88
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,930
In local news,
blood-related crime is on the rise

89
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,724
with a staggering one in 10 people
being confronted

90
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:37,477
by subsider activity in the last month.

91
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,859
Oh, shit!

92
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:01,834
Oh, fuck.

93
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,348
You all right?

94
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,267
- What are you doing?
- Get back.

95
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,687
- Hey, no. What are you...
- Don't come any closer.

96
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,730
- Shoot him again!
- Don't.

97
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,944
- You're... You're human.
- Shoot!

98
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,571
Don't shoot me again! Don't! I'm...

99
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,161
Listen, I can help you.

100
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:40,790
Come on! Come, get in my car. I'll help you.
Come on!

101
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:43,584
Let me help you. Come on, get in my car.

102
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,379
Come on. Come on!

103
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,382
Shit.

104
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:55,722
Come on, get in. It's all right. It's all right.

105
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:10,319
daytime protection driving mode activated.

106
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,633
Car 51 at location.

107
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,260
- roger, car 51.
- Shit.

108
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,804
- Are you okay, sir?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

109
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,849
- I'm all right.
- Did you get a good look at them, sir?

110
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:43,895
No, not really. You know, I...
It happened so fast.

111
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:46,272
They didn't wait around to see how I was,
you know.

112
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:50,276
We believe they may be human, sir.
Did you see where they went?

113
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:55,782
I think they went that way.

114
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,413
- You take care, sir.
- You, too.

115
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,790
Let's go.

116
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,846
Thank you.

117
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,349
- You okay?
- Yeah.

118
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,811
See you around.

119
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,772
Somehow I doubt that.

120
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,607
Happy birthday, Ed.

121
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:49,293
This is a community health
and safety announcement.

122
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,921
There is now one hour until sunrise.

123
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,188
Ten years after the 2009 outbreak,

124
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,066
vampiric wildlife
wandering into the sunlight

125
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,444
has become the number one cause
of forest fires throughout the nation.

126
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:19,490
The total national wildlife feeding ban
has not deterred people from venturing...

127
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:22,368
Linking homes and businesses
right across the city,

128
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:26,539
the subwalk Tunnel network is the safest
way to walk around during daylight.

129
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,376
subwalk. protection under the sun.

130
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:33,337
having your car modified
for daytime driving

131
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,256
shouldn't cost you the earth.

132
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,682
security alert. Back door ajar.

133
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,185
Frankie.

134
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,478
Hey, Ed.

135
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:55,318
- I hardly recognized you.
- It's only been a few months.

136
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,739
- I've got something for you.
- Yeah? What's that?

137
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:02,241
What the fuck do you think it is?

138
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:06,787
This is some birthday party, bro.

139
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,457
Yeah, well, I've turned 35 ten times.

140
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,210
Birthdays are pointless.

141
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,545
Bullshit. Let's have a drink.

142
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,226
It's one of the perks
of serving your country.

143
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:32,855
I hear even that pig shit you drink
is getting hard to find.

144
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,527
I can't.

145
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:41,530
Fuck that. You need it.

146
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:46,619
Yeah. Well, life's a bitch,
and then you don't die.

147
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:49,413
Come on.

148
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,667
I don't touch human blood.

149
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:56,462
You don't touch human blood.

150
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:59,257
You work for a company
that uses humans like fucking cattle.

151
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,175
Don't tell me how to live my life,
little brother.

152
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,928
Then don't act all high and mighty,
big brother.

153
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:07,056
See, look, Ed, your company
working on some type of fake blood,

154
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,225
that's one thing.
But we all know that their money

155
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:11,310
- comes from farming humans.
- Are we going to pick up off

156
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:14,146
- exactly where we left off?
- We all know they make their money...

157
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:17,066
I don't hunt humans. That is your job.

158
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,694
I find them, you farm them.

159
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,571
All right, well, let's just dump this shit,
all right?

160
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:25,616
Nothing changes, does it? Does it?

161
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,077
You still don't get why I joined.

162
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:33,958
What happens
when there isn't a single drop left?

163
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,876
When there isn't a single human,

164
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,462
- a single anything?
- We will always find more.

165
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,757
A blood substitute
means the end of human hunting.

166
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,302
Fake blood doesn't mean the end of shit.

167
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,095
Yeah. All right, well, if I believed that,

168
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:49,348
I'd have to drive a stake
through my heart right now.

169
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,278
Shit!

170
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,092
Frankie. Frankie...

171
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,436
Shit!

172
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:37,730
Oh, my God.

173
00:22:52,829 --> 00:23:12,306
Frankie!

174
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,298
Oh, fuck.

175
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:12,241
This is the third home invasion in this area
in the last month.

176
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:14,410
These things are in the suburbs now.

177
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:17,830
So it's important
that you update your security.

178
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:25,838
Subsiders. Strong bastards.

179
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:27,965
The same common trait as all the others.

180
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:31,927
The aggression is most likely brought on
by massive reductions in serotonin levels.

181
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:35,014
We need more patrols
ashing these filthy rats.

182
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:38,309
Ugly son of a bitch.

183
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:51,155
- Carl?
- What, you knew him?

184
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:57,036
Yeah, he was the local gardener.

185
00:24:58,121 --> 00:25:00,080
I saw him two weeks ago.

186
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,333
He's feeding off other vamps.

187
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:05,044
Only takes a couple of weeks
to get this messed up.

188
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:08,255
Some of his wounds look self-inflicted.

189
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,091
- He fed on himself?
- Perhaps.

190
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:14,386
That would speed up
mutation considerably.

191
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:16,597
Animals.

192
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,737
security alert. Back door ajar.

193
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:10,859
Hi.

194
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:18,409
Did you come to finish me off?

195
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:20,703
We need your help.

196
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:24,498
We've been searching
for vampires we can trust.

197
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:26,959
Trust?

198
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:37,219
You're a blood doctor. You can help us.

199
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:39,722
Help you how?

200
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:43,726
A blood substitute is a solution,
but it's not a cure.

201
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,561
There's another way.

202
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:49,523
Take it.

203
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:37,112
Who was that?

204
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,697
It's nothing.

205
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,625
With blood supplies continuing to dwindle,

206
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:51,919
private investors
are pulling their human stock

207
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:54,213
from the Bromley marks harvesting facility.

208
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:57,675
many experts believe that the company
will no longer be able to handle

209
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,301
the national blood demand.

210
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,387
The fda spokesperson confirmed...

211
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,059
How are you feeling, Edward?

212
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:10,479
The break-in must have been very traumatic.

213
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:12,606
I'm fine. Thank you.

214
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:20,614
Now, these attacks on everyday citizens
are a cause for great concern.

215
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:26,120
All the more reason to push forward,
wouldn't you say?

216
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,498
I'd just like your guarantee

217
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:33,585
that a substitute would replace our need
for a human supply, sir.

218
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:40,217
Well, it's important that we allow
the human race time to repopulate.

219
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,388
That's not exactly what I asked.

220
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:50,811
The majority of the population
will be content with a blood substitute, yes.

221
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:53,397
But there will always be those
who are willing to pay

222
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:55,899
a little extra for the real thing.

223
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:03,866
Come on, Edward, we have to be realistic.

224
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:07,786
If we don't cater to all markets,
someone else will.

225
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:13,751
How much do you think they'd be willing
to pay for your daughter?

226
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:38,043
He's waiting for you.

227
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:22,087
UV warning. UV warning. UV warning.

228
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:26,383
UV warning. UV warning.

229
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,952
Trees are the oldest living things on Earth.

230
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,581
Did you know that?

231
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:04,463
They say some are over 4,000 years old.

232
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:09,301
Some day though, this tree will die.

233
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:12,888
And so will you.

234
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,476
Maybe you won't die of old age like her,

235
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:22,230
but the thing you're holding onto,

236
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,566
that last breath of humanity,

237
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:28,654
will vanish as soon as the blood does.

238
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,616
What do you want?

239
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,368
Same thing you do.

240
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:36,828
A future.

241
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:55,013
I was like you once.

242
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,558
But not no more.

243
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:06,483
Lionel Cormac. My friends call me Elvis.

244
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,115
I ain't gonna bite.

245
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,372
Elvis.

246
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:22,416
Yeah. You know, like...

247
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,726
Feel that?

248
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:43,311
Hadn't been beating for nine years.

249
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,107
Seems impossible, don't it?

250
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:50,527
It is impossible.

251
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:53,238
So is walking around without a pulse.

252
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,615
But here you are.

253
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:58,452
How did you do it?

254
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,082
Audrey.

255
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,636
Put the gun down.

256
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,222
- Frankie?
- Put the gun down.

257
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:21,683
Frankie, what the hell are you doing?

258
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,393
- Move away from him, Ed.
- Put the gun down.

259
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:24,519
Don't make things worse.

260
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:25,729
- Stop pointing the gun!
- Move away from him.

261
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:27,230
- Frankie!
- This is serious shit, Ed.

262
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:30,067
They can put you away for a long time.

263
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,035
Let's go.

264
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,710
Motherfuckers!

265
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:55,008
Come on, get in my car! Come on!

266
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,654
Hey, hey, hey.

267
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:18,115
Shit.

268
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,161
Warning.

269
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,288
UV warning.

270
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,165
- I got it.
- UV warning.

271
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:33,672
UV warning.

272
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,216
Warning.

273
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:38,426
Shit!

274
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:40,887
- I can't...
- Move. Move!

275
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,646
Stay straight!

276
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:51,982
What the fuck?

277
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,004
Oh, fuck!

278
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,771
- Hang on.
- What is it?

279
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:59,049
- Everybody okay?
- Yeah.

280
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,574
Motherfuckers.

281
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,702
I loved that car.

282
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:18,169
You did the right thing.

283
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,630
That was my brother.

284
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:30,724
Come on.

285
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:46,740
Never been good at science, Doc.

286
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,618
Cars have always been my thing.

287
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:54,247
Daylight modifications are my specialty.

288
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,832
Or used to be.

289
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,545
Custom cameras, sun shields,
that kind of thing.

290
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:06,718
My garage was one of the first in town
to start doing them.

291
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,513
I had a shop right near your place.

292
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:14,476
Daytime driving, man. Nothing beats it.

293
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:18,313
No traffic, no cops.

294
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:21,191
Trouble is, if you ain't careful,

295
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:24,194
you can get yourself one hell of a sunburn.

296
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:41,252
You can only go on so long without blood
before it messes with your head.

297
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:05,360
It's amazing how quickly
your whole world can change.

298
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,612
Ain't it, Doc?

299
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:27,424
We need to recreate this safely.

300
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,135
That's why we need you.

301
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,472
The sun?

302
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:38,560
You're human because of the sun?

303
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:41,146
Hurt like hell.

304
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:01,249
Please have a seat.

305
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:07,630
Do you know who I am?

306
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:10,508
My brother has mentioned you before, sir.

307
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:16,931
You did the right thing
reporting his actions, Mr. Dalton.

308
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:21,769
You want to continue to do the right thing,
don't you, son?

309
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:24,522
I will do whatever is asked of me, sir.

310
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:30,612
Edward was a valuable member of our team

311
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:33,615
and an essential part of all of our futures.

312
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,952
All we wish is for him to continue
with his work.

313
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:42,373
And if he returns immediately,
no formal charges will be laid.

314
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:46,294
I don't know what you think I can do, sir.

315
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:51,758
Do you like being a vampire, son?

316
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:55,303
Yes, sir.

317
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:56,429
Why?

318
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:01,768
I mean, your brother clearly disapproves.

319
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:05,271
I wonder if it's a common trait
in your family.

320
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:08,942
I'm good at this.

321
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:12,612
I was never very good at being human, sir.

322
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:15,573
And I'm not my brother.

323
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:23,248
Well, good then, Frankie.

324
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:32,090
Every couple of weeks
we head out to search for others.

325
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:37,470
It's getting harder and harder
to find anybody.

326
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:41,516
I only managed to pick up three
when you drove us off the road.

327
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:47,063
Stop the car. Stop the car.

328
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:54,195
When was the last time
you drank human blood?

329
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,322
What... What's the matter?

330
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:00,702
I'm fine.

331
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:06,207
Oh, you don't...

332
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:14,132
We need you focused.

333
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:17,594
- No! No, I'm not...
- She ain't asking, Doc.

334
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:27,145
Where we're going,

335
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:31,441
I can't afford to worry about you
around the others.

336
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:23,326
Well, it's about goddamn time.

337
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:25,870
Stop worrying, you'll live longer.

338
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:32,460
Jarvis, this is Ed.

339
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,462
Ed.

340
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:39,050
Well, ain't this nothing.

341
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:43,388
Usually, when there's a vampire around,
I'm the one shitting my pants.

342
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,724
You better be worth the risk, man.

343
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:48,976
Jar's made contact
with the largest human group

344
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:51,854
we've found in a long time,

345
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:54,065
and he is gonna bring them back here.

346
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:57,193
I set up more cots in the cellar.

347
00:44:57,277 --> 00:45:00,655
We'll stay in radio contact
and keep you updated.

348
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:02,073
Good luck.

349
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:05,785
You, too.

350
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:27,056
Is this place safe?

351
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:28,933
Being human in a world full of vampires

352
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:32,311
is about as safe
as barebacking a five-dollar whore.

353
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:36,607
This is home, Doc, but none of us are safe.

354
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:44,198
This vineyard belonged to my parents.

355
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:45,825
They always wanted me to run it some day,

356
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:49,328
but at the time,
I was more interested in going to college.

357
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,748
Not long after the outbreak, I came back

358
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:56,961
and it seemed like a good place to hide.

359
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,340
- I'm gonna...
- Okay.

360
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:06,220
I owe that girl my life.

361
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:10,183
She found me after I was shaked and baked
and brought me here.

362
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:15,271
I want you to meet someone.

363
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:20,777
Ed. This is Senator Wes Turner.

364
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:22,320
- Well, hello.
- Hey.

365
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:24,864
- You made it.
- Yeah. Yeah, barely.

366
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:28,159
- More damn vampires.
- Back off, Colin.

367
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:30,161
They're trying to help.

368
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:35,416
Hey, being a vampire and a politician,
it can be hard to make friends.

369
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:38,836
Wes knows enough vampires in office
that want this cure,

370
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:42,590
and more importantly,
will use it for the right reasons.

371
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:45,259
We want to rebuild the human race,

372
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:48,554
but a way back can be a dangerous thing
in the wrong hands.

373
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:51,599
We're an endangered species, Doc.

374
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:53,559
It's time we changed all that.

375
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:22,630
The escalating global blood crisis

376
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:25,633
has seen prices skyrocket
over the past week.

377
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:30,805
experts believe
that this will make blood unobtainable

378
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:32,348
to many citizens across the country

379
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:36,227
and create what can only be described
as a subsider epidemic.

380
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:39,063
please stand behind the yellow line.

381
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,694
Excuse me.

382
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:49,198
This is not what I asked for.

383
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:50,616
Read the sign, sir.

384
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:56,497
I don't care what the sign says.

385
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:03,588
Just put some more fucking blood
in my coffee.

386
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:04,922
I can't.

387
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:27,570
Move!

388
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:54,472
We've tested burning extracted blood
under Uv light,

389
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:57,433
and it always remains infected.

390
00:48:57,517 --> 00:48:59,602
How could yours possibly be human?

391
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:02,021
You tell me, Doc.

392
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:05,232
What did it feel like
when the sun hit your body?

393
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:07,902
What do you mean what did it feel like?

394
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:11,614
I felt like a goddamn piece of fried chicken.

395
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:14,867
Can you remember anything specific
about it, anything at all?

396
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:18,204
Well, I remember when the sunlight hit me,

397
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:23,125
it was like a bolt of lightning
kick-starting my heart.

398
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:29,340
It was like someone let the air
back in the room.

399
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:38,683
Maybe the only way to treat the blood
is inside the body.

400
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:42,353
We need to control a daylight burn.

401
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:53,072
- The pick up was successful.
- That's great, Jarvis.

402
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:54,782
Total count's 15.

403
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:57,618
We'll stay clear of the interstate,
so it might take us a while to get back.

404
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:59,203
Okay, be safe.

405
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:05,084
Are you okay?

406
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:08,838
They may be frightened of you,

407
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:11,841
but none of them doubt
that you can help us.

408
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:16,095
I can't even remember
what it's like to be human.

409
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:20,641
Are you afraid to die?

410
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:23,436
Yeah.

411
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:28,024
Most of us are too scared of death
to think of it as an option.

412
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:30,568
I guess that's why so many turned.

413
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:35,573
How did it happen to you?

414
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:38,284
I was betrayed.

415
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:42,371
My brother...

416
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:54,592
What are these?

417
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:56,927
Wine fermentation tanks.

418
00:50:57,012 --> 00:51:00,181
Fermentation. That's airtight, right?

419
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:01,974
Yeah, that's right.

420
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:11,317
- What's that?
- It's an extraction fan.

421
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:14,361
It pulls air out of the tank
to stop the wine from oxidizing.

422
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:17,615
Okay, perfect.
We'll use that to put out the fire.

423
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:42,598
How far is it to the winery, Jarvis?

424
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:44,892
It's about two hours from here.

425
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:49,355
So have you been doing this for long?
Picking up humans, giving them a home?

426
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,482
Since the beginning.

427
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:54,068
There's not many of us left now.

428
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:55,653
How long you been running?

429
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:58,989
Most of us have been on the run together
for years.

430
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,409
I've never seen it this bad.

431
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:04,745
What made you come all the way out here?

432
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:08,749
It's safer. There's lots of sun.

433
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:11,001
There's not a lot of shade.

434
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:12,962
Not much food, either, huh?

435
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:16,298
Yeah. Thanks.

436
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:21,679
Shit.

437
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:31,605
Damn it.

438
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:59,216
Shit!

439
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:03,095
Tranq dart! Move! Move!

440
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:31,540
Oh, shit.

441
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,336
Move, move!

442
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:38,214
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

443
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:42,176
Keep in line!

444
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:49,767
Fire!

445
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:52,269
Pick it up! Pick it up!

446
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:56,774
Off to the right!

447
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:13,624
Can anyone hear me?

448
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:17,127
hello? Is anyone there?

449
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:19,505
We hear you. Who is this?

450
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:20,798
They've found us.

451
00:54:20,882 --> 00:54:22,967
- They're everywhere.
- Where are you?

452
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:32,518
Please! No! No! No!

453
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:36,188
Are you still there?

454
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:49,243
It's completely secluded.

455
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:51,120
It should be the safest place
for us to regroup.

456
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:52,413
How long will it take to get there?

457
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:55,666
If we stay off the main highway and follow
the trails along the Marshall River,

458
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,584
we should reach my cabin before nightfall.

459
00:54:57,669 --> 00:55:00,546
- Okay.
- You be careful.

460
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:01,839
You, too.

461
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:09,096
- Come on, Ed. We gotta go.
- I can't.

462
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:12,433
- They'll be here soon.
- The sun is about to come up.

463
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:14,935
We may never get a chance
to set up this experiment again.

464
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,353
I've got to do it.

465
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:19,440
- That thing could kill you.
- I'm already dead.

466
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:24,737
Fuck it.

467
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:28,365
I do love a good barbecue.

468
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:06,362
You don't need that.

469
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:09,073
You're safe here, I promise.

470
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:11,367
Where are my friends?

471
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:15,329
Don't hurt them. Please.

472
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,917
You look so beautiful.

473
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:22,586
You've grown up so much.

474
00:56:28,009 --> 00:56:29,426
Dad, please.

475
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:33,097
I'm so happy to see you.

476
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:36,600
I never thought
I'd see you again, sweetheart.

477
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:38,936
You're safe now.

478
00:56:39,437 --> 00:56:40,854
You're safe.

479
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:46,819
But your friends, there's nothing I can do.
I'm sorry.

480
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:50,656
You're not sorry!

481
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:55,327
Ali, let me help you, please.

482
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:18,434
You sure you're ready to do this?

483
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:21,937
Yeah, what could go wrong?

484
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:36,493
You feel so warm.

485
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,287
Ready, Doc?

486
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:23,248
- I'm ready.
- Let's do it, Aud.

487
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:30,214
Okay, on my count. Three, two, one, now!

488
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:49,399
Ed!

489
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:53,654
- I'm all right.
- He's okay, Aud!

490
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:57,032
Well, let's do it again. Again!
Let's do it again!

491
00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:05,958
Three, two, one, now!

492
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:22,266
You okay? You okay?

493
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,393
Ed?

494
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:27,187
- Yeah. Again. Again.
- He's fine!

495
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:39,324
Three, two, one, now!

496
01:00:06,894 --> 01:00:07,936
Ed.

497
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:13,150
Ed?

498
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:21,158
Lord almighty.

499
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:53,190
mr. Dalton.

500
01:00:54,233 --> 01:00:56,026
How's the shoulder, son?

501
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:57,611
It's healing quickly.

502
01:00:57,695 --> 01:00:59,696
How about yourself, sir?

503
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:01,239
I'll survive.

504
01:01:03,576 --> 01:01:06,995
You know, during the Civil War,

505
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:11,750
General Sherman said,
"'I am tired and sick of war,

506
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:14,920
"'its glory is all moonshine.

507
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:17,047
"'War is hell. "'

508
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:22,594
Less than 50 humans have been captured
in the last week.

509
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:26,223
Some believe hell may well be coming.

510
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:30,686
But with dedicated soldiers like yourself,

511
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:33,271
we can prevent that from happening.

512
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:38,276
Frankie,

513
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:45,158
I need you to do something for me.

514
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:55,794
Get away from me.

515
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:57,671
You don't need to be scared of me.

516
01:01:57,755 --> 01:01:59,089
Stay away.

517
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:03,093
Is this what you want? To live in fear?

518
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:07,264
See, I can help you. Make you one of us.

519
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:08,932
- Free.
- No!

520
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:11,101
You can live forever.

521
01:02:11,185 --> 01:02:12,936
Fuck you!

522
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:56,373
Welcome back.

523
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:43,211
She won't drink her blood ration, sir.

524
01:04:44,589 --> 01:04:45,714
Okay.

525
01:04:57,435 --> 01:04:58,518
Ali?

526
01:05:01,772 --> 01:05:03,064
Oh, baby.

527
01:05:07,653 --> 01:05:11,114
Ali, what are you doing?
That'll poison you.

528
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:17,245
Is this what you wanted?

529
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:19,831
- No, sweetheart. No.
- Is this what you wanted?

530
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,124
No, no.

531
01:05:25,379 --> 01:05:27,130
You did this!

532
01:05:27,214 --> 01:05:29,341
- You did this!
- No!

533
01:05:32,803 --> 01:05:34,304
You did this!

534
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:59,454
military forces have been ordered
to most major cities around the country

535
01:05:59,538 --> 01:06:01,665
in a bid to contain
what is now being described

536
01:06:01,749 --> 01:06:03,875
as the subsider epidemic.

537
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,752
military leaders have announced
they will take

538
01:06:05,836 --> 01:06:08,213
a strict no-tolerance approach to the crisis.

539
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:11,549
an order to commence
the immediate round-up and capture

540
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:14,260
of all class-4 blood-deprived citizens

541
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:16,012
has been issued.

542
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:29,401
We close?

543
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:31,861
The Senator's cabin
should be just up ahead.

544
01:07:35,634 --> 01:07:37,135
It's all gone.

545
01:07:39,764 --> 01:07:41,097
Everything.

546
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:44,726
We'll start again.

547
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:48,313
We can't keep running.

548
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:53,735
I know someone who can help.

549
01:08:04,997 --> 01:08:07,457
With the current military round-up
in full effect,

550
01:08:07,541 --> 01:08:10,752
it is likely we will continue to see
a decreased subsider presence

551
01:08:10,836 --> 01:08:11,836
on our streets.

552
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:13,546
But the question has been asked,
now what?

553
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:17,675
Our families are starving.
We can't afford to feed these creatures, too.

554
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:21,638
I know it may be wrong,
but these things, they gotta go.

555
01:11:01,465 --> 01:11:05,385
Thank you. I know. I know.

556
01:11:05,469 --> 01:11:08,304
Well, I couldn't have done it without you.

557
01:11:10,808 --> 01:11:11,933
Shit.

558
01:11:14,478 --> 01:11:16,229
I'll call you back.

559
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:21,901
You're really human.

560
01:11:24,571 --> 01:11:26,864
- This is unbelievable.
- Hold it.

561
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:32,245
I'm sorry, who are you?

562
01:11:32,329 --> 01:11:34,455
We're the folks with the crossbows.

563
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:36,791
It's a dangerous time, Chris.

564
01:11:36,875 --> 01:11:40,253
We can't be too careful, all right?
Sit down, please.

565
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:44,757
Ed, it's me.

566
01:11:45,592 --> 01:11:48,594
After the six years
we spent working together,

567
01:11:48,679 --> 01:11:51,347
you know the sacrifices I've made.

568
01:11:54,435 --> 01:11:55,643
I know.

569
01:11:56,687 --> 01:11:58,438
All right, listen.

570
01:11:58,522 --> 01:12:02,358
We've got something,
something better than a blood substitute.

571
01:12:04,611 --> 01:12:06,237
We've got a cure.

572
01:12:06,822 --> 01:12:10,783
And I can repeat the procedure,
but I'm going to need your help.

573
01:12:11,285 --> 01:12:14,037
This is a chance to change everything.

574
01:12:26,091 --> 01:12:27,717
How'd you do it?

575
01:12:41,565 --> 01:12:43,441
You gonna answer that?

576
01:12:49,239 --> 01:12:50,406
Hello.

577
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:53,743
No. Yeah.

578
01:12:56,121 --> 01:12:59,248
Hold on. Ex-wife.

579
01:12:59,917 --> 01:13:02,335
It's messy. Can you give me a sec?

580
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:04,754
Yeah.

581
01:13:07,591 --> 01:13:10,134
No, we didn't agree on that, no.

582
01:13:11,095 --> 01:13:12,762
What are you talking about?

583
01:13:23,023 --> 01:13:25,316
This is one fucking ugly house.

584
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:37,120
- Where you going?
- To check on your friend.

585
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:16,451
Go!

586
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:33,926
If they find us, we can't help her.

587
01:15:17,721 --> 01:15:19,138
Put it down!

588
01:15:24,311 --> 01:15:26,062
I don't believe it.

589
01:15:29,566 --> 01:15:31,442
Don't come any closer.

590
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:38,366
Frankie, I've found a cure.

591
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:42,245
All right? I can change you back.

592
01:15:45,123 --> 01:15:47,041
- No.
- Put it down, kid.

593
01:15:47,125 --> 01:15:50,086
No, it's all right. Frankie, it's all right.

594
01:15:51,463 --> 01:15:53,881
Frankie, it's not too late.

595
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:58,636
Do you know why I turned you, Ed?

596
01:16:04,643 --> 01:16:09,063
You used to say to me that you'd rather die
than be like the rest of us.

597
01:16:11,483 --> 01:16:16,988
I didn't turn you because it was convenient
or because of some selfish need for blood.

598
01:16:18,282 --> 01:16:22,618
I turned you
because you would have died if I didn't.

599
01:16:25,038 --> 01:16:26,998
I couldn't lose you, Ed.

600
01:16:30,836 --> 01:16:32,587
I've fucked up bad.

601
01:16:37,175 --> 01:16:39,302
I can get you out of here.

602
01:16:39,386 --> 01:16:42,305
We're not going anywhere without Audrey.

603
01:16:42,389 --> 01:16:44,849
- The woman.
- Yeah, the woman.

604
01:16:46,727 --> 01:16:48,686
You'll never get to her.

605
01:16:51,648 --> 01:16:53,316
You wanna help us?

606
01:16:56,194 --> 01:16:57,403
Please.

607
01:17:04,953 --> 01:17:10,791
Okay.

608
01:17:19,134 --> 01:17:20,259
Shit!

609
01:17:28,226 --> 01:17:29,644
God damn it!

610
01:18:33,583 --> 01:18:37,670
Edward, you got a tan. It suits you.

611
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:45,177
You know, Edward,

612
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:50,599
her blood has a scent
that no substitute could ever replace.

613
01:18:53,103 --> 01:18:54,186
Fear.

614
01:19:04,489 --> 01:19:06,282
I don't want to die.

615
01:19:09,786 --> 01:19:13,205
I can't do this, this being human.

616
01:19:14,249 --> 01:19:17,793
- Isn't that what you wanted?
- I don't want to be afraid.

617
01:19:18,336 --> 01:19:21,422
I can never be free like this. I see that now.

618
01:19:22,466 --> 01:19:25,509
Please. Help me.

619
01:19:28,346 --> 01:19:30,556
What is it that you want?

620
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:34,018
Turn us both, let us leave,

621
01:19:34,102 --> 01:19:38,230
and I'll show you a way
to repopulate your entire human supply.

622
01:19:38,315 --> 01:19:40,900
What the hell are you doing?

623
01:19:40,984 --> 01:19:43,611
- And you would give me this cure?
- Yes.

624
01:19:44,863 --> 01:19:47,948
- As long as you allow her to go free, too.
- No.

625
01:19:50,994 --> 01:19:55,080
She doesn't sound that interested
in your proposition, Edward.

626
01:19:55,165 --> 01:19:58,292
- In time, she'll come to understand.
- Will she?

627
01:20:01,755 --> 01:20:03,088
Thank you.

628
01:20:05,175 --> 01:20:09,094
You know, I won't deny that things
have gotten progressively worse

629
01:20:09,179 --> 01:20:10,930
during your absence.

630
01:20:11,014 --> 01:20:14,517
The public, the military, everyone,
it seems, is starving.

631
01:20:15,185 --> 01:20:18,270
Our blood supplies are, well, gone.

632
01:20:19,105 --> 01:20:20,105
Ed.

633
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:23,526
I myself was feeling the effects
of the deprivation.

634
01:20:24,486 --> 01:20:26,362
But as of yesterday,

635
01:20:27,364 --> 01:20:29,532
it's all a thing of the past.

636
01:20:33,245 --> 01:20:36,413
You know, I always thought it would be you

637
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:40,459
that would come up
with a stable substitute, not Christopher.

638
01:20:40,544 --> 01:20:42,670
But I guess I was wrong.

639
01:20:43,713 --> 01:20:45,381
Look.

640
01:20:45,465 --> 01:20:48,175
We go into mass production in two days.

641
01:20:49,302 --> 01:20:51,554
It's never been about a cure.

642
01:20:53,723 --> 01:20:55,933
It's about repeat business.

643
01:20:59,062 --> 01:21:03,774
And besides, what's to cure?

644
01:21:08,071 --> 01:21:09,905
So you see, Edward,

645
01:21:12,993 --> 01:21:14,994
I don't need you anymore.

646
01:21:17,163 --> 01:21:19,999
Of course you couldn't make it as a human.

647
01:21:21,042 --> 01:21:22,418
You're weak.

648
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:29,425
The truth is, you've always been a coward.

649
01:21:34,347 --> 01:21:37,433
What did it feel like
to turn your own daughter?

650
01:21:39,019 --> 01:21:41,020
You didn't do it, did you?

651
01:21:41,313 --> 01:21:42,813
You couldn't, could you?

652
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:45,274
You had my brother do it for you.

653
01:21:48,111 --> 01:21:50,362
So who's the fucking coward?

654
01:21:57,996 --> 01:22:00,497
No! No!

655
01:22:34,991 --> 01:22:37,993
Your blood... What have you done to me?

656
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:43,582
vampires think they own this world,

657
01:22:45,418 --> 01:22:47,670
that the humans have to hide from it.

658
01:22:49,547 --> 01:22:51,173
That ain't true.

659
01:22:56,346 --> 01:22:59,515
Every day, the sun comes out,

660
01:23:04,187 --> 01:23:06,939
and every day, the vamps have to hide.

661
01:23:12,237 --> 01:23:14,363
Vampires can never survive.

662
01:23:15,907 --> 01:23:17,199
That's the truth.

663
01:23:22,247 --> 01:23:24,123
Elvis Presley once said,

664
01:23:25,041 --> 01:23:26,917
"'Truth is like the sun.

665
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:31,005
"'You can shut it out for a time,

666
01:23:33,591 --> 01:23:35,592
"'but it ain't going away. "'

667
01:23:40,098 --> 01:23:42,683
Mr. Bromley, open up!

668
01:23:44,310 --> 01:23:46,186
Treated vampire blood.

669
01:23:46,730 --> 01:23:48,355
That's the cure.

670
01:23:48,898 --> 01:23:50,899
Welcome back to humanity.

671
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:53,569
Now you get to die.

672
01:24:03,079 --> 01:24:04,413
Move! Move!

673
01:25:24,369 --> 01:25:25,661
Let's go.

674
01:25:49,853 --> 01:25:51,353
Don't do this.

675
01:25:53,356 --> 01:25:54,898
There's a cure.

676
01:25:56,943 --> 01:25:58,443
Don't do this.

677
01:26:05,451 --> 01:26:06,535
Run.

678
01:26:09,455 --> 01:26:10,539
No!

679
01:26:17,755 --> 01:26:18,881
Ed!

680
01:29:35,411 --> 01:29:37,287
There can't be a cure.

681
01:29:38,247 --> 01:29:40,082
I can't let you do it.

682
01:29:41,918 --> 01:29:43,251
I'm sorry.

683
01:31:14,844 --> 01:31:16,344
We have a cure.

684
01:31:16,846 --> 01:31:18,346
We can change you back.

685
01:31:19,015 --> 01:31:20,682
It's not too late.
