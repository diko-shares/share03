1
00:00:38,551 --> 00:00:42,954
I'll tell you, Carol, it's quite a sight
up here. All those stars, the blue water.

2
00:00:43,156 --> 00:00:45,215
Reminds me of that night in Cabo.
Remember?

3
00:00:45,392 --> 00:00:46,552
Hal, stay on the flight.

4
00:00:46,726 --> 00:00:48,193
A lot of sangria that night.

5
00:00:48,361 --> 00:00:50,522
Boy, could you put it away.
-Hal.

6
00:00:50,697 --> 00:00:54,656
I don't know how we made it to the hotel-
-Hal, you're at 91,400 feet.

7
00:00:54,834 --> 00:00:57,667
Ten feet higher, the window cracks
and you're tapioca.

8
00:00:57,837 --> 00:01:00,829
Just pushing it a little.
Maybe we'll set a record for the company.

9
00:01:01,007 --> 00:01:05,535
Please, Hal. For once in your life,
no stunts, no surprises.

10
00:01:07,347 --> 00:01:09,747
No surprises.

11
00:01:54,994 --> 00:01:57,326
Find him.

12
00:01:59,165 --> 00:02:02,100
Make this landing and we'll have
a perfect flight, Mr. Jordan.

13
00:02:02,268 --> 00:02:05,931
So does this mean I get a gold star,
or just an incredible simulation?

14
00:02:25,525 --> 00:02:27,516
What happened to the power?

15
00:02:27,894 --> 00:02:29,452
Hello?

16
00:02:29,662 --> 00:02:32,096
Carol? Anybody?

17
00:02:32,465 --> 00:02:35,127
If I have to fly
this freaking park ride again...

18
00:02:44,477 --> 00:02:46,468
Okay.

19
00:02:59,726 --> 00:03:01,091
My God.

20
00:03:05,165 --> 00:03:06,598
No.

21
00:03:06,766 --> 00:03:08,734
It's all right.

22
00:03:09,068 --> 00:03:10,729
My time has come.

23
00:03:10,904 --> 00:03:11,962
You speak English.

24
00:03:12,138 --> 00:03:13,867
No.

25
00:03:14,174 --> 00:03:16,233
It's the ring.

26
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:21,238
It has chosen you. Take it.

27
00:03:53,146 --> 00:03:57,139
You are now a Green Lantern...

28
00:03:57,317 --> 00:04:00,445
...one of the protectors of the universe.

29
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,181
The Guardians will send for you.

30
00:04:04,857 --> 00:04:06,484
Use...

31
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:08,490
...the ring...

32
00:04:08,728 --> 00:04:10,855
...wisely.

33
00:04:39,192 --> 00:04:40,716
What the hell?

34
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,955
...and when that weird
glow cleared, the simulator was...

35
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,383
Was there an earthquake?

36
00:07:31,431 --> 00:07:34,559
I guess it's okay,
but a whole week?

37
00:07:34,734 --> 00:07:35,860
Where are you going?

38
00:07:36,035 --> 00:07:39,232
I don't know. I thought I'd do
some exploring. See some new sights.

39
00:07:39,405 --> 00:07:41,999
Not much else to do
until we get word on the prototype.

40
00:07:42,175 --> 00:07:45,235
Well, at least the simulator
wasn't damaged too badly.

41
00:07:45,411 --> 00:07:47,606
Hey, Carol, gotta run.
I'll call you from...

42
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,304
...wherever.

43
00:08:04,697 --> 00:08:05,925
So it's true.

44
00:08:06,098 --> 00:08:08,430
Abin Sur really is dead.

45
00:08:09,802 --> 00:08:10,962
Where is his body?

46
00:08:12,638 --> 00:08:15,732
I said, where is...?
-It was blown up with the spacecraft.

47
00:08:16,876 --> 00:08:17,968
I want it off.

48
00:08:18,644 --> 00:08:19,975
Hey!

49
00:08:20,413 --> 00:08:22,244
The poozer's not even trained.

50
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,049
Someone's been practicing.

51
00:08:35,928 --> 00:08:37,623
And without a manual.

52
00:08:37,797 --> 00:08:40,766
Let's all power down for a moment,
shall we?

53
00:08:41,701 --> 00:08:45,000
I don't think
we've been properly introduced.

54
00:08:45,838 --> 00:08:47,305
My name is Sinestro.

55
00:08:47,473 --> 00:08:49,668
This is Boodikka, Tomar Re...

56
00:08:49,842 --> 00:08:53,403
...and you've met our charming Kilowog.
-Heh.

57
00:08:54,647 --> 00:08:57,343
And you?.
-Hal Jordan.

58
00:08:57,517 --> 00:08:59,178
Well, Hal Jordan...

59
00:08:59,352 --> 00:09:01,820
...we are members
of the Green Lantern Corps...

60
00:09:01,988 --> 00:09:05,185
...an elite, intergalactic force
from the planet Oa.

61
00:09:05,358 --> 00:09:09,124
Our superiors are a group of immortals
known as the Guardians.

62
00:09:09,295 --> 00:09:12,230
Yeah. They're supposed to send for me.
-That's right.

63
00:09:12,398 --> 00:09:14,628
We're to bring you back for a little chat.

64
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,495
And in case you're wondering...

65
00:09:16,669 --> 00:09:18,762
...this is not a request.

66
00:09:19,138 --> 00:09:21,766
The ring isn't yours
until the Guardians have decided.

67
00:09:22,475 --> 00:09:24,238
-Okay.
-Very good.

68
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,776
Tomar, would you do the honors?

69
00:09:49,101 --> 00:09:53,037
We thought the trip might be easier
for you in a more earthly construct.

70
00:09:54,774 --> 00:09:57,334
Uh, thanks.

71
00:10:28,741 --> 00:10:31,005
You must understand, earthling...

72
00:10:31,177 --> 00:10:34,613
...the Green Lantern Corps
is a privileged organization.

73
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,714
Not just anyone can join.

74
00:10:36,882 --> 00:10:38,873
There are tremendous commitments.

75
00:10:39,051 --> 00:10:41,110
Each Lantern is responsible...

76
00:10:41,287 --> 00:10:45,621
...for patrolling one of 3600 sectors
of the universe.

77
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,691
But...
-Sort of like one cop per precinct.

78
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,622
Uh, yes. I- I suppose.

79
00:10:50,796 --> 00:10:52,696
My uncle was a cop.

80
00:10:52,865 --> 00:10:55,561
Yes, but...
-Thirty years on the Coast City police force.

81
00:10:55,735 --> 00:10:58,226
He used to let me
turn on the siren. Nice guy.

82
00:10:59,338 --> 00:11:04,332
But more than that, the Green Lantern
ring is a complex tool.

83
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:07,570
It takes someone
with fierce concentration.

84
00:11:07,747 --> 00:11:09,146
I think I got the hang of it.

85
00:11:09,715 --> 00:11:11,546
He's got the hang of it.

86
00:11:11,717 --> 00:11:12,741
Ranakar.

87
00:11:12,918 --> 00:11:16,046
Why are we even entertaining this?
He's a human.

88
00:11:16,222 --> 00:11:18,622
Yes, hard to get past that.

89
00:11:19,725 --> 00:11:23,786
I'm afraid the human race of Earth
does not have the most stellar reputation.

90
00:11:25,898 --> 00:11:31,564
The fact is humans are crude,
base, fearful and untrustworthy.

91
00:11:31,737 --> 00:11:32,897
Then there's the smell.

92
00:11:34,573 --> 00:11:36,973
You can't condemn an entire species.

93
00:11:37,143 --> 00:11:38,735
You've said it yourself, Ganthet.

94
00:11:38,911 --> 00:11:41,106
It's a wonder they've lasted this long.

95
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,805
Maybe you'd like me
to list their atrocities.

96
00:11:43,983 --> 00:11:45,644
Maybe our human can help us.

97
00:11:45,818 --> 00:11:47,809
Maybe he has a few of his own.

98
00:11:49,989 --> 00:11:52,048
Listen, buddy, I didn't ask for this ring.

99
00:11:52,224 --> 00:11:55,682
You want it back, take it,
because I've had enough of this crap.

100
00:11:57,129 --> 00:12:01,156
Well, it appears we can add impertinence
to their many qualities.

101
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:02,857
The human has a point.

102
00:12:03,035 --> 00:12:05,265
If he were as unworthy
as everyone says...

103
00:12:05,438 --> 00:12:08,896
...no power in the galaxy could
have forced that ring on his finger.

104
00:12:09,075 --> 00:12:12,670
Yet there it is, at one with him.

105
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,041
Guardian Council, if I may speak.

106
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,016
Please, Sinestro.

107
00:12:19,185 --> 00:12:22,882
The Lantern of Sector 1417
is recognized.

108
00:12:23,055 --> 00:12:24,647
Thank you, Appa Ali Apsa.

109
00:12:24,824 --> 00:12:26,382
I'd like to make a proposal.

110
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:29,995
Allow me to take the human
under my wing, test him out...

111
00:12:30,162 --> 00:12:31,561
...see what he's made of.

112
00:12:32,164 --> 00:12:33,324
That's my job.

113
00:12:33,499 --> 00:12:36,434
People can surprise you
if you give them a little incentive.

114
00:12:36,602 --> 00:12:39,435
You have more important things
on your agenda, Sinestro.

115
00:12:39,605 --> 00:12:42,233
We have a deepening crisis at hand.

116
00:12:42,408 --> 00:12:46,071
I understand, sir, but I thought
the human could be of assistance.

117
00:12:46,245 --> 00:12:48,110
It's a bit out of the ordinary...

118
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,714
...but I'd be interested
in Sinestro's evaluation.

119
00:12:50,883 --> 00:12:52,908
Shall we put it to a vote?

120
00:12:53,085 --> 00:12:55,212
All in favor.

121
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:11,325
So be it. The human falls
under your command, Sinestro.

122
00:13:11,504 --> 00:13:13,267
Good luck.

123
00:13:14,673 --> 00:13:16,300
I'm the trainer around here.

124
00:13:16,475 --> 00:13:18,170
I know, I know.

125
00:13:18,811 --> 00:13:22,406
So, what now?
-Now, I own your ass.

126
00:13:23,582 --> 00:13:24,742
Come on.

127
00:13:32,691 --> 00:13:34,522
What's the crisis
they were talking about?

128
00:13:34,693 --> 00:13:37,025
A small matter
of who's gonna control the universe.

129
00:13:37,563 --> 00:13:39,690
Not that it's in the best hands as it is.

130
00:13:43,569 --> 00:13:44,968
But first things first.

131
00:13:45,137 --> 00:13:47,628
You are on sacred ground, Earth boy.

132
00:13:47,807 --> 00:13:49,638
We're at the center of the universe.

133
00:13:49,809 --> 00:13:53,108
This lantern contains the battery
that powers all the rings.

134
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,476
It also contains
all the known information of the cosmos.

135
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:03,013
A sort of atlas
and who's who of space.

136
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:05,817
We're going to be playing
in Sector 1215.

137
00:14:05,991 --> 00:14:07,652
You need to be brought up to speed.

138
00:14:11,163 --> 00:14:15,998
Stick your ring in the light,
think 1215 and the battery will do the rest.

139
00:14:38,724 --> 00:14:40,715
Unbelievable.

140
00:14:41,293 --> 00:14:42,590
This isn't a travelogue.

141
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,212
Not bad.
The last rookie fried his antennas off.

142
00:15:12,191 --> 00:15:13,818
Glad I could impress you.

143
00:15:14,393 --> 00:15:15,485
But you do.

144
00:15:15,661 --> 00:15:18,221
Unlike the others, I like humans.

145
00:15:18,397 --> 00:15:22,333
I admire their spirit and
their natural contempt for authority.

146
00:15:22,501 --> 00:15:24,492
It's well-founded here.

147
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,864
You mean the Guardians?

148
00:15:26,038 --> 00:15:29,701
They were a power at one time,
but now they've grown soft.

149
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:32,139
They've no idea
what it's like on the front line.

150
00:15:32,311 --> 00:15:34,541
But don't you worry, Earth boy.

151
00:15:34,713 --> 00:15:38,205
They'll be taking notice of you.
I need to know if you've got the stuff...

152
00:15:38,384 --> 00:15:40,215
...for what's ahead.
-What's that?

153
00:15:40,719 --> 00:15:43,984
We're going to get the butcher
who killed Abin Sur.

154
00:15:53,365 --> 00:15:55,731
Cadmendoh is a pustule of a planet.

155
00:15:55,901 --> 00:15:58,028
A breeding ground of criminal scum.

156
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:01,430
One time I suggested we clean it out
with a meteor shower.

157
00:16:01,607 --> 00:16:03,302
The Guardians thought I was kidding.

158
00:16:03,475 --> 00:16:06,000
Who we after?
-A squidman named Cuch.

159
00:16:06,178 --> 00:16:07,440
He killed Abin Sur?

160
00:16:07,613 --> 00:16:09,604
With a smile.

161
00:16:15,955 --> 00:16:17,855
I don't have this place in my files.

162
00:16:18,023 --> 00:16:19,320
It's called Labella's.

163
00:16:19,491 --> 00:16:21,584
It changes addresses frequently.

164
00:16:27,266 --> 00:16:28,460
Is he Labella?

165
00:16:28,634 --> 00:16:30,465
He's the bouncer.

166
00:16:30,636 --> 00:16:33,434
Watch my back
and keep your mouth shut.

167
00:16:37,109 --> 00:16:38,599
Aah!

168
00:16:42,281 --> 00:16:43,305
Boolywatt.

169
00:16:43,482 --> 00:16:44,642
Sinestro.

170
00:16:44,817 --> 00:16:46,182
Looks like a busy night.

171
00:16:46,352 --> 00:16:47,979
Any chance Cuch has shown up?

172
00:16:48,153 --> 00:16:49,484
Don't know no Cuch.

173
00:16:49,655 --> 00:16:53,284
Booly, Booly, Booly. Look at you.

174
00:16:53,993 --> 00:16:55,961
Like a big rubber Booly ball.

175
00:16:56,128 --> 00:16:58,460
Bet I could bounce you off the wall.

176
00:16:59,598 --> 00:17:02,897
I- I haven't seen him. I swear!

177
00:17:03,068 --> 00:17:05,161
You know who to come to when you do.

178
00:17:05,337 --> 00:17:07,100
Yeah.

179
00:17:42,674 --> 00:17:44,665
Maybe we should have come undercover.

180
00:17:44,843 --> 00:17:46,936
What's the fun in that?

181
00:17:53,685 --> 00:17:55,016
Labella.

182
00:17:55,454 --> 00:17:56,716
S-man.

183
00:17:56,889 --> 00:17:59,357
You should've let me know
you were coming, baby.

184
00:17:59,525 --> 00:18:01,186
Always surprising me.

185
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,554
Why you do that?

186
00:18:02,728 --> 00:18:04,855
Could've made some cozy time.

187
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,294
I'm in a bit of a hurry, my dear.

188
00:18:07,466 --> 00:18:09,024
I'm looking for Cuch.

189
00:18:09,201 --> 00:18:10,395
Cuch?

190
00:18:10,569 --> 00:18:11,831
Don't ask me.

191
00:18:12,004 --> 00:18:13,301
I'm not his mother.

192
00:18:13,472 --> 00:18:14,700
I heard he was in town.

193
00:18:14,873 --> 00:18:17,205
Cuch left with the bug man, baby.

194
00:18:17,509 --> 00:18:19,500
Long time ago.

195
00:18:19,678 --> 00:18:21,373
Never come back to old Labella.

196
00:18:21,747 --> 00:18:23,647
How come I don't believe you?

197
00:18:24,349 --> 00:18:27,045
How come these suits got no zippers?

198
00:18:31,223 --> 00:18:35,159
Aw, honey, you're not gonna slam Labella
for a little moon ball.

199
00:18:35,327 --> 00:18:37,955
I can't control all the shank
that gets in here.

200
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,563
Take it.
-What?

201
00:18:39,731 --> 00:18:40,925
A little incentive.

202
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,795
Maybe it will jog your memory.

203
00:18:42,968 --> 00:18:44,629
Go ahead.

204
00:18:57,649 --> 00:19:00,174
You're a bad boy, S-man.

205
00:19:00,352 --> 00:19:01,580
What about Cuch?

206
00:19:01,753 --> 00:19:02,913
I told you.

207
00:19:05,757 --> 00:19:07,088
No.

208
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:09,022
One more.

209
00:19:16,034 --> 00:19:17,626
Sinestro, come on.

210
00:19:17,803 --> 00:19:20,237
-Where is he?
-I don't know.

211
00:19:23,842 --> 00:19:25,241
Honey, I beg you.

212
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:26,638
Where's Cuch?

213
00:19:27,346 --> 00:19:29,211
I don't know.

214
00:19:37,322 --> 00:19:38,414
End this.

215
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,649
I know what I'm doing.

216
00:19:40,993 --> 00:19:43,154
He always comes back to you after a job.

217
00:19:43,328 --> 00:19:44,488
Please...

218
00:19:44,663 --> 00:19:46,597
And he's here. He's close, isn't he?

219
00:19:54,439 --> 00:19:56,873
Just tell me, Labella.

220
00:20:03,882 --> 00:20:05,679
What do you mean? Where is she?

221
00:20:05,851 --> 00:20:07,842
Labella!

222
00:20:09,588 --> 00:20:11,249
Shoot.

223
00:20:25,971 --> 00:20:27,563
I'm going up.

224
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,825
It's a fragger!
-Aah!

225
00:21:48,453 --> 00:21:49,750
Aah!

226
00:23:24,015 --> 00:23:25,676
I got lucky.

227
00:23:26,151 --> 00:23:27,209
Unh!

228
00:23:27,619 --> 00:23:28,881
You defied me.

229
00:23:29,054 --> 00:23:30,988
You could've killed her.

230
00:23:31,156 --> 00:23:32,783
Let me tell you, friend.

231
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:35,153
The only way to operate out here
is by fear.

232
00:23:35,327 --> 00:23:36,794
They hit, I hit harder.

233
00:23:36,962 --> 00:23:38,987
They attack, I annihilate.

234
00:23:39,164 --> 00:23:42,656
I am the one constant, unassailable force
against their chaos...

235
00:23:42,834 --> 00:23:44,665
...and you made them forget that.

236
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,233
You think I enjoy this?

237
00:23:47,406 --> 00:23:49,636
Look at the universe
the Guardians have created.

238
00:23:49,808 --> 00:23:52,971
We have the greatest power in the cosmos
and what have they made us?

239
00:23:53,145 --> 00:23:54,612
Garbage collectors!

240
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,509
We pick up the trash.

241
00:23:56,681 --> 00:23:58,672
A thief here, a killer there.

242
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:01,341
Scum, dirt, filth!

243
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,648
There's no end to it,
but there could be.

244
00:24:04,823 --> 00:24:08,554
It's my dream that one day
all this rot will be wiped away.

245
00:24:08,727 --> 00:24:12,094
A new order will prevail,
one that will end the chaos...

246
00:24:12,264 --> 00:24:14,357
...but it won't be built
by the faint of heart.

247
00:24:14,533 --> 00:24:20,699
You got soft on me back there, Earth boy,
and that I will not tolerate.

248
00:24:22,207 --> 00:24:24,937
Everything okay?
We heard there was a disturbance.

249
00:24:25,544 --> 00:24:26,875
We're fine.

250
00:24:27,045 --> 00:24:28,740
Hey, you got Cuchie.

251
00:24:28,914 --> 00:24:30,404
Don't he look peaceful.

252
00:24:30,582 --> 00:24:34,541
I'm taking him to the nearest substation.
I want everyone with me.

253
00:24:38,924 --> 00:24:41,586
You all right?
-Yeah.

254
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,920
Swell.

255
00:24:59,411 --> 00:25:00,844
Ugh.

256
00:25:02,481 --> 00:25:04,005
Mind if I join you?

257
00:25:04,182 --> 00:25:06,480
Might hurt your reputation.

258
00:25:09,521 --> 00:25:10,647
Give them time.

259
00:25:10,822 --> 00:25:12,289
You have to understand...

260
00:25:12,457 --> 00:25:15,187
...Abin Sur, everyone loved him.

261
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,123
He had family, friends.

262
00:25:17,295 --> 00:25:19,559
He was irreplaceable.

263
00:25:20,232 --> 00:25:21,563
Any news on Cuch?

264
00:25:21,733 --> 00:25:24,566
They took him to interrogation.
-Who's asking the questions?

265
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:25,930
Who do you think?

266
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:34,411
Ouch.
-I know. Sinestro can be difficult.

267
00:25:37,282 --> 00:25:39,614
All right, he can be pretty damn arrogant.

268
00:25:39,784 --> 00:25:43,345
Some of us are starting to worry about him,
but he's under a lot of pressure.

269
00:25:43,522 --> 00:25:46,286
Yeah, saving the universe or something.
-That's right.

270
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:48,024
Cuch is just a bit player.

271
00:25:48,193 --> 00:25:51,026
The one we're really after
is his boss, Kanjar Ro.

272
00:25:51,496 --> 00:25:52,690
He's just a warlord.

273
00:25:52,864 --> 00:25:53,888
Not anymore.

274
00:25:54,065 --> 00:25:57,694
Not since he found the yellow element.
-Should I be taking notes?

275
00:25:58,336 --> 00:26:00,930
This story goes back as far
as time itself...

276
00:26:01,106 --> 00:26:03,506
...when the only sentient beings
were the Guardians.

277
00:26:06,011 --> 00:26:07,774
They built the lantern battery...

278
00:26:07,946 --> 00:26:10,005
...long before the creation
of the Corps.

279
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:15,110
The battery would power all the rings
with the green element...

280
00:26:15,287 --> 00:26:17,551
...the greatest energy source
in the universe.

281
00:26:17,722 --> 00:26:20,156
Where it comes from
only the Guardians know.

282
00:26:20,325 --> 00:26:23,385
But once it was installed,
the Guardians had the ultimate weapon...

283
00:26:23,562 --> 00:26:26,554
...to maintain peace and promote justice
in the galaxies.

284
00:26:26,731 --> 00:26:30,690
Unfortunately, the battery
had one vulnerability, the color yellow.

285
00:26:30,869 --> 00:26:33,838
It's one part of the light spectrum
that can resist the green...

286
00:26:34,005 --> 00:26:36,565
...and the most concentrated source
of yellow energy...

287
00:26:36,741 --> 00:26:37,901
...is the yellow element.

288
00:26:38,076 --> 00:26:42,172
For eons, the Guardians had it hidden
underground in another dimension...

289
00:26:43,148 --> 00:26:45,639
...until Kanjar Ro found out.

290
00:26:46,084 --> 00:26:47,984
When the Guardians
discovered the theft...

291
00:26:48,153 --> 00:26:51,384
...they called for an emergency meeting
with the senior Lanterns.

292
00:26:51,556 --> 00:26:53,387
Abin Sur offered to go undercover.

293
00:26:55,026 --> 00:26:57,187
Within days, he had infiltrated
Ro's ship...

294
00:26:57,362 --> 00:26:59,489
...but there was no sign
of the yellow element.

295
00:26:59,664 --> 00:27:01,894
Kanjar Ro had taken it somewhere.

296
00:27:02,634 --> 00:27:07,298
Abin Sur was about to report back
to the Guardians when he was found out.

297
00:27:47,312 --> 00:27:48,973
That's the way I heard it.

298
00:27:49,147 --> 00:27:51,240
From there,
Abin Sur made his way to Earth.

299
00:27:51,416 --> 00:27:54,783
And now you're here.
-Jeez.

300
00:27:55,754 --> 00:27:58,917
You captured Cuch by yourself.
-He tell you that?

301
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:01,456
No. I was in your head.

302
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,819
Interesting.

303
00:28:04,262 --> 00:28:07,129
As you know,
Kanjar Ro was forced to abandon his ship...

304
00:28:07,298 --> 00:28:09,095
...after Abin Sur's escape.

305
00:28:09,267 --> 00:28:10,529
Now he's on the move again.

306
00:28:10,702 --> 00:28:12,067
I just found out from Cuch...

307
00:28:12,237 --> 00:28:16,196
...that Ro and his men are meeting at
the Kadian Space Terminal at 1700 hours.

308
00:28:16,374 --> 00:28:18,001
That's it? That's all you got?

309
00:28:20,979 --> 00:28:22,378
Not that it isn't significant.

310
00:28:22,547 --> 00:28:26,278
No. It's good to know.
Needed. Necessary even.

311
00:28:27,452 --> 00:28:30,353
I want everyone back here
at 1600 hours.

312
00:28:30,522 --> 00:28:32,820
We'll leave together.
Are there any questions?

313
00:28:32,991 --> 00:28:33,980
If not, then-

314
00:28:40,432 --> 00:28:42,491
Excuse me.

315
00:28:45,737 --> 00:28:49,798
This is not the first time
we've had to reprimand you, Sinestro.

316
00:28:49,974 --> 00:28:52,636
This cruelty is hardly the Guardian way.

317
00:28:52,811 --> 00:28:53,869
He was resistant.

318
00:28:54,045 --> 00:28:55,478
It made the process difficult.

319
00:28:55,647 --> 00:28:58,013
-I did my best.
-We should have been called.

320
00:28:58,183 --> 00:29:00,981
We might have been able
to use our telepathy to draw him out.

321
00:29:01,152 --> 00:29:02,449
Time is running out.

322
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:05,555
And we're facing a foe
who is hell-bent on destroying us.

323
00:29:05,724 --> 00:29:08,318
The Green Lantern Corps
is an ideal, Sinestro.

324
00:29:08,493 --> 00:29:11,621
You don't save it
by ignoring what it stands for.

325
00:29:11,796 --> 00:29:14,560
This must not happen to Kanjar Ro.

326
00:29:14,733 --> 00:29:17,793
The moment he is captured,
he is to be brought to us.

327
00:29:17,969 --> 00:29:19,459
We'll do the questioning.

328
00:29:19,637 --> 00:29:21,332
Is that understood?

329
00:29:21,506 --> 00:29:22,996
Yes, sir.

330
00:29:28,246 --> 00:29:30,510
They will doom us all.

331
00:29:52,337 --> 00:29:54,999
I'll need someone
to watch this outer perimeter. Ch'p?

332
00:29:55,173 --> 00:29:56,470
I always get the stink jobs.

333
00:29:56,641 --> 00:29:58,575
Let the new guy do it.
-Whatever.

334
00:29:58,743 --> 00:30:00,677
Fine. Let's go.

335
00:30:02,046 --> 00:30:04,913
Don't trip over the luggage.

336
00:30:18,129 --> 00:30:19,596
Attention, travelers.

337
00:30:19,764 --> 00:30:22,289
We apologize
for this interruption in service.

338
00:30:22,467 --> 00:30:26,335
The Green Lantern Corps has requested
a routine scan of the spaceport.

339
00:30:26,504 --> 00:30:31,464
There is nothing to be concerned about.
Operations will resume momentarily.

340
00:30:40,485 --> 00:30:43,147
That red-faced swine
wants to flush me out.

341
00:30:43,321 --> 00:30:45,186
What should we do?

342
00:30:46,524 --> 00:30:48,151
Leave.

343
00:30:50,228 --> 00:30:51,820
The room. Get out.

344
00:30:53,932 --> 00:30:56,196
I'll let you know when I'm done.

345
00:31:10,515 --> 00:31:12,312
I am here.

346
00:31:12,584 --> 00:31:14,484
Make yourself present.

347
00:31:15,386 --> 00:31:17,786
Sinestro, I'm calling.

348
00:31:18,423 --> 00:31:20,254
Make your presence known.

349
00:31:27,498 --> 00:31:28,624
I'm here.

350
00:31:29,133 --> 00:31:32,591
What kind of stunt are you trying to pull?
-You're a hard man to reach.

351
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:34,465
What do you want, a daily briefing?

352
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:38,131
It's dangerous to talk, even like this,
especially with Abin Sur dead.

353
00:31:38,309 --> 00:31:41,301
Communication, Ro. It goes two ways.

354
00:31:41,479 --> 00:31:43,379
I swear I'm not squeezing you out.

355
00:31:43,548 --> 00:31:45,880
Where's the yellow element?
-With the Weaponers.

356
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:48,484
The weapon is ready for pickup.
We don't have long.

357
00:31:48,653 --> 00:31:50,177
Where?
-I'm gonna tell you...

358
00:31:50,355 --> 00:31:51,845
...surrounded by your pack dogs?

359
00:31:52,023 --> 00:31:53,684
Don't try me, Ro.

360
00:31:53,858 --> 00:31:58,056
I've put everything on the line for this:
the Corps, the future, my life.

361
00:31:58,229 --> 00:32:00,288
I am not going
to be given the runaround.

362
00:32:00,465 --> 00:32:03,628
Tell you what, we go to the Weaponers
together, just you and me.

363
00:32:03,801 --> 00:32:06,133
You get rid of your boys,
I'll get rid of mine.

364
00:32:06,304 --> 00:32:08,329
Where are you?
-In a waiting room.

365
00:32:08,506 --> 00:32:12,203
I'll meet you at Station 50 in half an hour.
But if I see one ring anywhere-

366
00:32:12,377 --> 00:32:14,004
Just be there.

367
00:32:17,715 --> 00:32:20,707
Tomar, we have a change of plans.

368
00:32:23,254 --> 00:32:24,414
Come on. We're leaving.

369
00:32:24,822 --> 00:32:25,846
But the rings...

370
00:32:26,024 --> 00:32:28,083
Use your faders.

371
00:32:40,038 --> 00:32:41,369
Jordan?

372
00:32:41,539 --> 00:32:44,099
Tell me you got him.
-Not yet. How are you doing?

373
00:32:44,275 --> 00:32:47,938
So far I've seen 10 shooting stars,
one supernova and a baggage handler.

374
00:32:48,112 --> 00:32:51,445
Tomar says Sinestro wants
to re-deploy most of us to the next port.

375
00:32:53,017 --> 00:32:56,578
Get over to the south perimeter.
Tomar is meeting us there.

376
00:32:56,921 --> 00:32:58,388
Uh-huh.

377
00:33:01,893 --> 00:33:03,383
You okay?

378
00:33:03,628 --> 00:33:06,358
Yeah. Something hit me.

379
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,363
Stay here.

380
00:33:46,471 --> 00:33:47,733
Hold it, bug boy.

381
00:34:21,439 --> 00:34:22,667
Aah!
Aah!

382
00:34:44,028 --> 00:34:46,496
Jordan, where are you?

383
00:34:46,664 --> 00:34:48,564
Got a little pest-control problem.

384
00:35:10,755 --> 00:35:12,313
Where is Kanjar Ro?

385
00:35:13,291 --> 00:35:15,657
Sinestro. He's heading for the west gates.

386
00:35:15,827 --> 00:35:17,988
Do whatever it takes. I need him alive.

387
00:35:27,638 --> 00:35:29,299
Rings!

388
00:36:48,653 --> 00:36:50,644
Nice move.
-Hm.

389
00:36:55,826 --> 00:36:57,919
All right, one at a time.

390
00:37:00,698 --> 00:37:02,256
What are you doing? Where's Ro?

391
00:37:02,433 --> 00:37:05,163
Sinestro, these people-
-These people are irrelevant.

392
00:37:05,336 --> 00:37:07,827
The Corps is on the line.
Get that through your heads.

393
00:37:08,005 --> 00:37:10,496
None of us,
and therefore none of them are safe...

394
00:37:10,675 --> 00:37:12,040
...until we get Kanjar Ro.

395
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:16,044
I don't care if we have to tear
this place apart girder by girder.

396
00:37:22,386 --> 00:37:23,648
It's him.

397
00:37:24,855 --> 00:37:27,255
Unh. Ooh!
-Ugh!

398
00:37:33,898 --> 00:37:35,490
Push it.

399
00:38:18,743 --> 00:38:21,109
Huh? Yeah.
-You all right?

400
00:38:32,623 --> 00:38:34,215
Good shot.

401
00:38:34,392 --> 00:38:38,123
They're going to reach us.
-Time to lighten the load.

402
00:38:51,776 --> 00:38:53,073
Holy crap!

403
00:38:56,447 --> 00:38:58,210
We have to get through.

404
00:39:06,157 --> 00:39:08,751
There's a rift ahead.
We can get out home free.

405
00:39:28,913 --> 00:39:30,346
It's that guy from the port.

406
00:39:30,514 --> 00:39:33,449
So why are you sitting here?

407
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:56,359
Unh!

408
00:41:18,722 --> 00:41:19,711
Ugh.

409
00:41:21,992 --> 00:41:24,017
One bug left.

410
00:41:54,458 --> 00:41:56,619
I'd power down if I were you.

411
00:41:58,729 --> 00:42:01,289
I'm the only one who knows
where the Weaponers are.

412
00:42:01,465 --> 00:42:03,626
Without me, you'll never find them.

413
00:42:07,838 --> 00:42:10,568
Take me in, and I'll implicate you,
I swear.

414
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:17,744
Come on, Sinestro. Put the ring down.
We can still work this out.

415
00:42:21,452 --> 00:42:23,943
Sinestro?
-I'm thinking.

416
00:42:24,121 --> 00:42:25,611
What's there to think about?

417
00:42:25,789 --> 00:42:27,586
Plan B. It could work.

418
00:42:34,999 --> 00:42:36,193
Sinestro.

419
00:42:36,367 --> 00:42:38,130
Yes.

420
00:42:49,647 --> 00:42:51,137
Down here.

421
00:43:01,959 --> 00:43:04,860
You entered the
pilot's cabin on your own.

422
00:43:05,029 --> 00:43:06,053
Yes, sir.

423
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:09,393
And you did not see Kanjar Ro?
-No, sir.

424
00:43:09,567 --> 00:43:12,001
And you have no recollection
of killing him?

425
00:43:12,169 --> 00:43:13,397
I did not kill him.

426
00:43:13,571 --> 00:43:16,062
Someone did,
and he wore a Green Lantern ring.

427
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,432
You were the first ones there.

428
00:43:18,609 --> 00:43:21,806
Actually, Tomar Re and Boodikka
arrived on the scene first...

429
00:43:21,979 --> 00:43:23,571
...but I was there soon after.

430
00:43:23,747 --> 00:43:25,840
We followed the ship's
vapor trail separately.

431
00:43:26,016 --> 00:43:28,177
-And no one else was on the ship?
No.

432
00:43:28,352 --> 00:43:30,912
But I think it's perfectly
understandable what happened.

433
00:43:31,088 --> 00:43:33,352
The human was attacked by Kanjar Ro...

434
00:43:33,524 --> 00:43:36,925
...and in his last moments
of consciousness, he struck back.

435
00:43:37,094 --> 00:43:39,187
A clear case of self-defense.

436
00:43:39,363 --> 00:43:41,831
He should never have put himself
in that situation.

437
00:43:41,999 --> 00:43:43,523
If he hadn't played hero...

438
00:43:43,701 --> 00:43:47,034
...you might have caught up with
the ship and taken Kanjar Ro alive.

439
00:43:47,204 --> 00:43:50,640
Now there's no telling into whose
hands the yellow element might fall.

440
00:43:50,808 --> 00:43:52,537
Perhaps you'd like to say something?

441
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:54,541
I didn't kill him.

442
00:43:54,712 --> 00:43:55,906
Then who did?

443
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:59,015
Whoever took his Energi-Rod.
I sure as hell don't have it.

444
00:43:59,183 --> 00:44:00,650
By your brash actions...

445
00:44:00,818 --> 00:44:03,810
...you have placed the universe
in absolute turmoil.

446
00:44:03,988 --> 00:44:06,149
Excuse me, but the turmoil began...

447
00:44:06,323 --> 00:44:09,451
...when the yellow element was stolen
under your watch.

448
00:44:10,094 --> 00:44:12,255
We've heard enough.
Indeed.

449
00:44:12,429 --> 00:44:17,492
Hal Jordan, it greatly disappoints me
that in the judgment of this tribunal...

450
00:44:17,668 --> 00:44:20,432
...you have been found
of insufficient discipline...

451
00:44:20,604 --> 00:44:23,300
...to carry on the duties
of a Green Lantern.

452
00:44:23,474 --> 00:44:25,965
Will the sergeant-at-arms
please come forth?

453
00:44:28,579 --> 00:44:32,071
You shall hand your ring over
to Commander Kilowog.

454
00:44:45,462 --> 00:44:50,923
Kilowog, you will keep the ring
until the Guardians choose its successor.

455
00:44:51,101 --> 00:44:52,591
And what of the yellow element?

456
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:56,228
I suggest we call a special session
with our honor guard...

457
00:44:56,407 --> 00:44:58,466
...to devise our next strategy.

458
00:44:58,642 --> 00:44:59,973
I can arrange that, sir.

459
00:45:00,144 --> 00:45:04,638
If there is nothing more,
this tribunal is over.

460
00:45:31,842 --> 00:45:32,934
Are you my ride home?

461
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:37,342
We both volunteered.
Kilowog has something to say to you.

462
00:45:37,681 --> 00:45:40,275
I'm sorry I said the things
I said about you.

463
00:45:40,451 --> 00:45:44,012
You saved my life.
You are a brave and bold Green Lantern.

464
00:45:44,188 --> 00:45:45,348
Thanks, Kilowog.

465
00:45:47,991 --> 00:45:50,926
You gonna eat that?
-Go for it.

466
00:45:59,636 --> 00:46:02,104
Quite a day, huh?
-I'm sorry.

467
00:46:02,272 --> 00:46:04,706
Did you notice how calm he was?
-Who?

468
00:46:04,875 --> 00:46:08,208
Sinestro. He even defended me,
in a half-assed way.

469
00:46:08,378 --> 00:46:09,640
He's always been political.

470
00:46:09,813 --> 00:46:12,748
Would he have known where
the Guardians hid the yellow element?

471
00:46:12,916 --> 00:46:14,975
They trust him.
-He hates them, you know.

472
00:46:15,552 --> 00:46:17,042
He's critical.

473
00:46:17,421 --> 00:46:20,413
Uh-uh. No, no. He can't stand them.

474
00:46:21,158 --> 00:46:24,719
What did the Guardian mean when he said
the Energi-Rod might be helpful?

475
00:46:24,895 --> 00:46:29,161
Kanjar Ro controlled it through his thoughts.
It might contain some psionic information.

476
00:46:29,333 --> 00:46:31,130
Like where he put the yellow element?

477
00:46:31,301 --> 00:46:34,031
Ranakar doesn't know his butt
from his poozer.

478
00:46:36,006 --> 00:46:37,200
Even if you had the rod...

479
00:46:37,374 --> 00:46:40,070
...you can't use it
without Kanjar Ro's brainwaves...

480
00:46:40,244 --> 00:46:43,372
...and that transmitter has been shut off
for good.

481
00:46:45,149 --> 00:46:48,880
Are you ready?
-Are we in a hurry?

482
00:47:06,654 --> 00:47:08,212
This is him.

483
00:47:30,644 --> 00:47:32,703
I know it's cold, Kanjar Ro.

484
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,178
I'm sorry about that.

485
00:47:35,516 --> 00:47:36,642
Where...?

486
00:47:36,817 --> 00:47:38,842
You're in the morgue. You're dead.

487
00:47:39,019 --> 00:47:41,351
Dead?
-I killed you.

488
00:47:41,522 --> 00:47:45,856
I'm reconnecting synapses for some
information. This shouldn't take long.

489
00:47:46,026 --> 00:47:48,187
You remember the yellow element, right?

490
00:47:48,362 --> 00:47:49,522
Yellow.

491
00:47:49,697 --> 00:47:52,598
You left it with the Weaponers.
Where are they?

492
00:47:53,567 --> 00:47:54,864
Qwar-

493
00:47:55,536 --> 00:47:56,867
One more time.

494
00:47:57,838 --> 00:47:59,772
Qwar...

495
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:03,876
Perhaps you can show me.
Let's sit up, shall we?

496
00:48:08,816 --> 00:48:12,946
All right, now. Where are the Weaponers?
Where is the yellow element?

497
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:26,488
Sector 324. Very good.

498
00:48:26,667 --> 00:48:28,362
Can you be more specific?

499
00:48:36,343 --> 00:48:38,709
Qward.
-Wow.

500
00:48:38,879 --> 00:48:40,779
Can you find the nearest pizza joint too?

501
00:48:44,618 --> 00:48:47,052
Well, well, this is a surprise.

502
00:48:47,955 --> 00:48:49,946
What's going on, Sinestro?

503
00:48:50,124 --> 00:48:51,648
It's fairly evident, Kilowog.

504
00:48:51,825 --> 00:48:54,726
I've been working behind the scenes
to find the yellow element.

505
00:48:54,895 --> 00:48:56,624
You killed Kanjar Ro.

506
00:48:56,797 --> 00:48:58,458
To save his hide.

507
00:49:01,568 --> 00:49:04,332
Careful now.
You don't want to damage the Energi-Rod.

508
00:49:04,505 --> 00:49:07,406
The core is quite unstable,
I've been told.

509
00:49:07,574 --> 00:49:08,973
You lied to the Guardians.

510
00:49:09,143 --> 00:49:10,906
I've lied to everyone. I've had to.

511
00:49:11,078 --> 00:49:12,545
Why?
-Think about it.

512
00:49:12,713 --> 00:49:16,080
How did Kanjar Ro know exactly
where to find the yellow element?

513
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:18,650
How was Abin Sur killed so quickly?

514
00:49:19,987 --> 00:49:22,319
Are you saying there's a traitor?
-Of course.

515
00:49:22,489 --> 00:49:24,980
Why do you think
I wanted to work with Earth boy?

516
00:49:25,159 --> 00:49:27,150
At least I could be sure he was clean.

517
00:49:27,327 --> 00:49:29,158
You should've told the Guardians.

518
00:49:29,329 --> 00:49:30,523
In due time.

519
00:49:30,698 --> 00:49:33,428
Let's get the yellow
element first, Kilowog.

520
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,090
Then we'll all be heroes.

521
00:49:37,237 --> 00:49:39,432
Take off your ring.

522
00:49:41,008 --> 00:49:43,442
Don't be ridiculous. Boodikka?

523
00:49:43,610 --> 00:49:47,444
Sorry, Sinestro. I don't think
you can talk your way out of this one.

524
00:49:48,115 --> 00:49:50,345
Ugh!
-Jeez.

525
00:50:04,131 --> 00:50:05,155
He's still alive.

526
00:50:05,332 --> 00:50:08,631
If she had killed him, his ring
would have flown to the Guardians.

527
00:50:08,802 --> 00:50:11,464
And we'd rather not have that happen
just yet.

528
00:50:11,638 --> 00:50:15,096
It was Jordan's idea to come here.
I was hoping you'd be gone by now.

529
00:50:15,275 --> 00:50:16,640
I told you he was bright.

530
00:50:17,978 --> 00:50:19,138
You played me.

531
00:50:19,313 --> 00:50:22,407
I needed to get inside your head,
see if you should join our club.

532
00:50:22,583 --> 00:50:23,880
But you're not easy to read.

533
00:50:24,051 --> 00:50:26,383
We really need to talk
about personal space.

534
00:50:27,054 --> 00:50:28,715
It's not too late, Jordan.

535
00:50:28,889 --> 00:50:32,154
Boodikka believes in my vision.
Others will too.

536
00:50:32,326 --> 00:50:36,387
But I could use someone like you
who has the stones to get things done.

537
00:50:36,563 --> 00:50:38,428
While the gnomes banish you...

538
00:50:38,599 --> 00:50:43,002
...I offer you power,
more power than you can imagine.

539
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:45,832
All I ask is for is your loyalty.

540
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:49,903
Now, you see, you had me.
Right up until that last part.

541
00:50:51,278 --> 00:50:53,644
And I thought humans were different.

542
00:50:53,814 --> 00:50:55,406
Take care of him.

543
00:50:59,453 --> 00:51:02,980
You can hide his body with Ro's.
I shouldn't be long.

544
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:29,608
Knock me out, will you?

545
00:52:28,876 --> 00:52:30,867
Humans.

546
00:53:04,745 --> 00:53:06,576
Good God.

547
00:53:38,679 --> 00:53:39,703
You're a Weaponer.

548
00:53:41,548 --> 00:53:43,038
I'm here for the yellow element.

549
00:53:44,351 --> 00:53:48,549
You are not the one.

550
00:53:48,722 --> 00:53:51,282
Kanjar Ro is dead. I was his partner.

551
00:53:51,625 --> 00:53:54,719
He told me to come to Qward
to pick the weapon up here.

552
00:53:54,895 --> 00:53:57,295
He paid for it and now it's mine.

553
00:54:04,304 --> 00:54:07,296
Listen, I don't have time for this.
I...

554
00:54:20,787 --> 00:54:22,277
Your friend...

555
00:54:22,456 --> 00:54:23,548
...is late.

556
00:54:23,724 --> 00:54:27,717
The weapon is now in forfeiture.

557
00:54:27,894 --> 00:54:31,625
It is yours to take.

558
00:55:03,296 --> 00:55:07,357
This is your control.

559
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:49,036
Our work is done.

560
00:55:49,209 --> 00:55:55,546
We leave this world
to return to our own.

561
00:55:55,715 --> 00:55:59,207
The weapon is a mighty force.

562
00:55:59,386 --> 00:56:06,121
The most powerful and absolute
in your universe.

563
00:56:06,293 --> 00:56:08,488
With one exception.

564
00:56:08,662 --> 00:56:09,822
One...

565
00:56:09,996 --> 00:56:11,122
...slight...

566
00:56:11,298 --> 00:56:14,324
...imperfection.

567
00:56:14,501 --> 00:56:15,559
What?

568
00:56:15,735 --> 00:56:18,568
The imperfection...

569
00:56:18,738 --> 00:56:22,674
...every weapon has.

570
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:26,573
Its user.

571
00:56:47,734 --> 00:56:49,793
So they got Boodikka.

572
00:56:49,970 --> 00:56:52,734
I start alone, I end alone.

573
00:56:56,543 --> 00:56:58,101
The Guardians want to see you.

574
00:56:58,278 --> 00:56:59,438
And I them.

575
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:01,607
What are you doing, Sinestro?

576
00:57:01,781 --> 00:57:03,612
Only what's necessary, Tomar.

577
00:57:05,285 --> 00:57:10,723
Oh, don't look so glum. The universe
has become too big for the gnomes.

578
00:57:20,567 --> 00:57:23,127
There's a new day dawning.

579
00:57:23,303 --> 00:57:25,237
A new sun rising.

580
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:38,479
He was our most brilliant
Lantern. A paragon of duty and service.

581
00:57:38,652 --> 00:57:40,449
The cleverest of them all.

582
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:44,147
Perhaps too clever, Ranakar.
We should have seen the signs.

583
00:57:44,324 --> 00:57:49,284
Until Sinestro gets an opportunity
to explain himself, I remain skeptical.

584
00:57:49,462 --> 00:57:52,625
One thing's for sure,
you took the ring off the wrong guy.

585
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:55,597
You ask me, you should give it back.

586
00:57:58,138 --> 00:57:59,605
When you're ready.

587
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:15,912
It's lost its power.

588
00:58:17,023 --> 00:58:18,684
Tomar.

589
00:58:20,227 --> 00:58:22,127
He killed them all.

590
00:58:55,762 --> 00:58:57,821
So it is true.

591
00:58:57,998 --> 00:59:01,058
Yes, Ganthet.
A new command is at hand.

592
00:59:01,234 --> 00:59:04,260
A new authority.
-How dare you?

593
00:59:04,437 --> 00:59:08,396
It's an affront to-
-Shut your mouth, you stupid little troll!

594
00:59:08,808 --> 00:59:13,336
You're nothing but a clutch of bickering
old biddies, ineffectual and obstructionist.

595
00:59:13,513 --> 00:59:17,244
In a galaxy screaming for order,
you have cast a deaf ear...

596
00:59:17,417 --> 00:59:20,250
...but all that ends now.

597
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:22,752
As demigods bound by your word...

598
00:59:22,922 --> 00:59:27,416
...all of you are going to pledge
your undying allegiance to me.

599
00:59:28,194 --> 00:59:29,354
Like hell!

600
00:59:29,529 --> 00:59:31,190
For once, Ranakar, we agree.

601
00:59:43,610 --> 00:59:46,135
Give this up, Sinestro.

602
00:59:55,689 --> 00:59:57,020
Unh!

603
00:59:59,159 --> 01:00:01,787
It must be difficult to relinquish power.

604
01:00:01,961 --> 01:00:04,589
Let me give you some incentive.

605
01:00:24,417 --> 01:00:29,252
You will have nothing.
Not even your lives, in the end.

606
01:00:38,765 --> 01:00:40,357
Gotta go, guy.

607
01:01:27,414 --> 01:01:29,348
Stand back.

608
01:02:09,756 --> 01:02:11,417
Good man.

609
01:02:32,111 --> 01:02:33,135
What the hell?

610
01:02:36,749 --> 01:02:38,614
Happy landings.

611
01:02:45,558 --> 01:02:47,253
It's dead.

612
01:04:05,672 --> 01:04:07,230
The Lanterns.

613
01:04:08,207 --> 01:04:12,473
Yes, all the ones in space,
with no power and no protection.

614
01:04:12,645 --> 01:04:16,445
You are generals without an army,
in a war you cannot win.

615
01:04:16,616 --> 01:04:18,345
How many more have to die?

616
01:04:18,518 --> 01:04:21,009
Enough, Sinestro. Please.

617
01:04:21,521 --> 01:04:24,183
We will accede to your demands.

618
01:04:36,436 --> 01:04:39,428
Come on, get green!

619
01:04:43,276 --> 01:04:45,369
Oh, son of a...

620
01:04:50,149 --> 01:04:51,776
Aah!

621
01:05:14,407 --> 01:05:16,637
The rings. Now.

622
01:05:44,704 --> 01:05:48,401
Frankly, Kilowog, you weren't
going to survive this anyway.

623
01:05:51,577 --> 01:05:52,566
Huh?

624
01:06:34,387 --> 01:06:35,786
I'll be damned.

625
01:06:40,259 --> 01:06:42,124
And you thought I was green before.

626
01:06:42,862 --> 01:06:44,454
Jordan.

627
01:07:51,230 --> 01:07:52,993
Do you see him?
-I...

628
01:07:53,166 --> 01:07:54,360
I can't tell.

629
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:03,467
The bastard's here somewhere.

630
01:10:06,866 --> 01:10:08,595
It's over, Sinestro.

631
01:10:08,768 --> 01:10:14,536
I still have plenty of juice left in this ring.
Enough to take yours for insurance.

632
01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:25,581
You're not strong enough.

633
01:10:25,751 --> 01:10:28,914
Just takes a little incentive.

634
01:12:00,713 --> 01:12:02,704
Excuse me, poozer.

635
01:12:10,956 --> 01:12:12,218
Jordan, can you hear me?

636
01:12:12,391 --> 01:12:13,483
Come in, Jordan.

637
01:12:14,593 --> 01:12:16,458
Where are you?

638
01:12:17,063 --> 01:12:19,463
Falling. I forgot my chute.

639
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:42,248
Very creative.

640
01:12:42,421 --> 01:12:44,082
Hey, I got a few tricks too.

641
01:12:52,364 --> 01:12:54,992
Though we continue
to mourn those who have fallen...

642
01:12:55,167 --> 01:12:58,159
...during the tragic betrayal
of recent days...

643
01:12:58,337 --> 01:13:02,239
...we also celebrate our resiliency.

644
01:13:02,408 --> 01:13:06,276
Our battery is repaired,
our rings replenished...

645
01:13:06,445 --> 01:13:09,710
...and our battle
against the dark forces continues.

646
01:13:09,882 --> 01:13:13,113
If we have learned anything
from our last battle...

647
01:13:13,285 --> 01:13:18,222
...it is that great evil can arise
from the most unexpected sources...

648
01:13:18,390 --> 01:13:23,020
...but, most thankfully,
so can great heroism.

649
01:13:24,530 --> 01:13:27,727
I've asked Ganthet
to lead us in our pledge.

650
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:30,130
If you don't mind, Appa Ali Apsa...

651
01:13:30,302 --> 01:13:34,534
...I'd like to give that privilege
to our newest Lantern, Hal Jordan.

652
01:13:36,475 --> 01:13:38,238
Hear, hear.

653
01:13:39,512 --> 01:13:40,809
What's the matter?

654
01:13:40,980 --> 01:13:43,312
I just learned the thing this morning.

655
01:13:48,354 --> 01:13:50,151
In brightest day-

656
01:13:50,322 --> 01:13:55,487
In blackest night,
no evil shall escape my sight.

657
01:13:55,661 --> 01:13:58,596
Let those who worship evil's might...

658
01:13:58,764 --> 01:14:03,599
...beware my power,
Green Lantern's light!

659
01:14:10,743 --> 01:14:11,767
I'm off.

660
01:14:11,944 --> 01:14:13,275
Where are you going?

661
01:14:13,445 --> 01:14:15,936
I've gotta go punch a clock
with my other boss.

662
01:14:16,649 --> 01:14:19,345
I can see where this is gonna be
a long commute.
