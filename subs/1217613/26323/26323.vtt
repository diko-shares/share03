00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:10,111
♫ Oh, my God,
please help me ♫

2
00:00:10,178 --> 00:00:12,913
♫ Knee-deep in the river
trying to get clean ♫

3
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,884
♫ He says wash your hands,
get out the stains ♫

4
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,487
♫ But you best believe, boy,
there's hell to pay ♫

5
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:23,457
♫ Yeah, you best believe, boy,
there's hell to pay, saying ♫

6
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:28,896
♫ Oh, my God,
please help me ♫

7
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:31,699
♫ Neck-deep in the river
screaming for relief ♫

8
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:35,002
♫ He says, it's mine to give
but it's yours to choose ♫

9
00:00:35,069 --> 00:00:38,072
♫ You're gonna sink or swim,
you're gonna learn the truth ♫

10

♫ No matter what do,
you're gonna learn
the truth, saying ♫

11
00:00:42,243 --> 00:00:45,012
♫ Ate the bread

12
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:48,616
♫ Fell from a cliff,

♫ And I'm all alone
and the fire grows ♫

15
00:00:54,522 --> 00:00:58,326
♫ And I'm all alone
and the fire grows ♫

16
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,873
How do you do that?

17
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:24,612
Wake up at the exact
same second every morning.

18
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:27,748
An act of will.

19
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:32,520
Anything wrong?

20
00:02:35,456 --> 00:02:38,859
This man showed up while I
was at the pool last night.

21
00:02:38,926 --> 00:02:41,262
It was very weird.

22
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:46,700
He told me to tell you
to call him.

23
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:49,303
He said his name was...

24
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,772
Karl Stoltz.

25
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:53,741
It doesn't ring a bell.

26
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,344
Another...

27
00:02:57,245 --> 00:02:59,247
degenerate

28
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,249
who works for
Billy McBride, of course.

29
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,251
Sent to intimidate us.

30
00:03:04,252 --> 00:03:07,120
Let's not talk about Billy.

31
00:03:07,255 --> 00:03:09,523
Tell me about me.

32
00:03:14,262 --> 00:03:15,663
I mean, I...

33
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:20,434
I'm just at the beginning
of knowing you,

34
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:21,969
if I even know you at all.

35
00:03:23,271 --> 00:03:24,705
You know me.

36
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,941
Tell me.

37
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:46,994
You're...

38
00:03:50,298 --> 00:03:51,932
so brilliant.

39
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:58,306
But very...

40
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:02,310
damaged.

41
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,550
Touch me while you tell me.

42
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:13,621
Mm-mm.

43
00:04:17,325 --> 00:04:20,494
Touch my face while you tell me.

44
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:30,338
You hurt...

45
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:32,940
so much...

46
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:37,378
because you're not loved.

47
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:43,651
One finger.

48
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:53,461
You built the firm together,
but it was mostly you,

49
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:56,764
and he got all the love...

50
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:00,368
while you...

51
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:04,371
you were the disfigured ghoul

52
00:05:04,372 --> 00:05:07,140
alone in a dark room.

53
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:11,144
He got the admiration
and affection,

54
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:15,382
and you got... fear.

55
00:05:15,383 --> 00:05:16,884
More.

56
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,719
And he mocked you.

57
00:05:20,588 --> 00:05:22,756
He still mocks you.

58
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,760
More.

59
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:27,861
You can sense it,

60
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:30,464
even as he threatens
people's livelihood

61
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:31,532
with this case,

62
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:33,701
that they're rooting for him.

63
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,471
Imagine everything...

64
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:40,974
everything that they have

65
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,444
you gave them.

66
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,851
And it is so, so wrong.

67
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,887
- Ohh!
- Yeah! Oh, fuck!

68
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:55,756
- Yeah!
- Oh, God!

69
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:57,791
Oh! Ohh!

70
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,860
Yeah! Ohh!

71
00:05:59,927 --> 00:06:00,928
Oh, yeah.

72
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:03,296
Oh, yeah. Oh,

73
00:06:03,431 --> 00:06:05,098
God, it feels so good.

74
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:06,333
Yeah. Ohh!

75
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:16,444
You didn't have to go that far.

76
00:06:16,477 --> 00:06:19,112
Yeah. I did.

77
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:25,553
So now what?

78
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:28,856
I'll take it from here.

79
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:35,929
Listen,

80
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:37,097
I... I'm real sorry

81
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:39,166
that I had you even
doing this shit.

82
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,902
Oh, hey. I'm a pro.

83
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:58,719
Two days are scheduled for
this round of depositions.

84
00:06:58,786 --> 00:07:01,321
We intend to use
every second of that time,

85
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:04,091
and we're not putting up with
any more of your nonsense.

86
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,527
Objection. Argumentative.
We just started this thing.

87
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:07,971
- Let's get out of here.
- See this?

88
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:09,897
It's a proposed
Order of Contempt,

89
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:11,565
to be filed with Judge Keller

90
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:14,001
should you continue
to be obstructionist.

91
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:20,007
Mrs. Larson,
if I were being kind,

92
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:23,310
I could say
that your testimony
has been inconsistent,

93
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:24,712
but it's far worse than that.

94
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,780
- It's mendacious.
- Mendacious?

95
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:29,316
I'm sorry. That means
that you're lying.

96
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:30,551
I'm not lying.

97
00:07:30,618 --> 00:07:33,153
- Of course you are.
- Object. Strike that.

98
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,226
Thank you.

99
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:16,096
I want to punch that
midget bitch in the face.

100
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:17,798
I swear to God.

101
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:19,833
Actually,
she's improved a little.

102
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:24,171
Have you ever in your life
had a worse deposition?

103
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:26,574
I don't know.
Probably not.

104
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:27,908
Maybe. I'm not sure.

105
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:31,812
Thank you.

106
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:38,118
I mean, that was... that
was a literal disaster.

107
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:40,754
My thing is, and I
don't even like kids,

108
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:42,956
how is it that you can
look at a child

109
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,793
and just make them
feel like shit?

110
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:53,767
God damn!

111
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:55,936
What are you doing?

112
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:00,608
We'll be right there.
Just stay calm.

113
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:02,910
It's all right. Okay.

114
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:03,744
Bye.

115
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:05,178
What? Who was that?

116
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:08,916
Marva. Somebody broke
in the storage locker.

117
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:09,717
What?

118
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:11,284
Yes. We got to go.

119
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:12,953
Okay. Wait. Wait.

120
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,622
Stop. I want you
to call the cops,

121
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:16,824
and there's literally
a hospital down the street.

122
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,225
I can move it.
It's not broken.

123
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,426
You have to get
it X-rayed.

124
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:20,628
Get in the fucking car.

125
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:22,195
You don't know if it's bro...

126
00:09:27,635 --> 00:09:28,902
God damn it.

127
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:31,304
Help me with the steering
wheel, will you?

128
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,646
Okay, let go, God damn it.

129
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,918
Oh, shit.

130
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:49,757
Son of a bitch.

131
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,258
Look, I don't know who did this,

132
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:52,392
but it wasn't Borns Tech

133
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:53,770
because they gave us
all this stuff.

134
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:54,995
Yeah, I know that, Marva.

135
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:57,164
The model at Ryan's
and the blueprints,

136
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,165
where are they?

137
00:09:58,231 --> 00:09:59,466
They're in my car.

138
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,334
All right, let's go.

139
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:04,071
Oh, no. Please, Billy, no.

140
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:06,506
Please? I can't clean
this up by myself!

141
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:08,608
It's just some fucking
papers, honey.

142
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:13,981
God damn it.

143
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:16,416
The forces
of anti-American hatred

144
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:18,151
that killed my brother...

145
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:20,688
those enemies are out

146
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:22,790
to destroy every
single one of us.

147
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:25,859
It's one of the reasons
I went into law...

148
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:28,361
so that I could work
with companies

149
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:30,430
like Borns Tech,

150
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:33,166
who make it their mission

151
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:37,137
to fight evil
in the Middle East.

152
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:39,506
The evidence will show

153
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:43,410
that this case is about evil.

154
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,778
Ha!

155
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:46,446
How'd you get this?

156
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:48,348
Friends in the IT department.

157
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:49,458
Listen...
Listen to this part.

158
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,852
In 2004,

159
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:55,288
my brother Adam was killed

160
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:58,258
fighting the forces of evil
in Mosul.

161
00:10:59,727 --> 00:11:01,361
I know the Larsons' hurt.

162
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:07,200
I know what it is
to... lose someone.

163
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:09,302
- He was...
- See?

164
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:10,804
That.

165
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:12,840
That's why he tapped her:

166
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:15,475
her dead brother.

167
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:16,643
Can you believe it?

168
00:11:16,744 --> 00:11:18,746
It's not a bad choice.

169
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,614
The jury's going to love her.

170
00:11:21,749 --> 00:11:25,585
That's my opening in my case.

171
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:27,520
Think about it.

172
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:28,756
The hardest thing to do

173
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:30,858
is to humanize
a corporate client,

174
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:33,426
and Lucy does that.
Look at her.

175
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:35,095
He was my entire world.

176
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:41,001
You're right.

177
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:43,771
I hate that.

178
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:45,572
And when he died, I vowed...

179
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:47,040
That's all you get from this?

180
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:49,276
- ...to make it my mission...
- What?

181
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:50,443
What?
What did I miss?

182
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,946
...Borns Tech who keep
our loved ones safe.

183
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:55,015
That it's cruel for Donald

184
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:56,950
to be putting a young
girl through this,

185
00:11:57,017 --> 00:12:00,020
to be milking her pain
for the good of a case.

186
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:01,454
When she's done with it,

187
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:02,598
you think he's going to care?

188
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:03,622
Of course not.

189
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:05,192
For all we know,

190
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:07,460
this is exactly
why he hired her,

191
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:11,799
just in case Borns Tech
got caught on their shit.

192
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:14,234
He's so fucking cold.

193
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:27,347
A little hot to be doing
that today, isn't it, judge?

194
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:31,627
Did you ever build a float
out of these things

195
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:34,354
and put them in the Rose Parade?

196
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,456
What are you doing here?

197
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:37,825
I would have called,

198
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:39,135
but your clerk wouldn't
give me the number...

199
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,759
- Are you drunk?
- ...so I came over. No.

200
00:12:40,828 --> 00:12:42,505
I hope so for your sake
that you are drunk.

201
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:45,098
I'm not drinking, no.
This is really important.

202
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:46,867
If you'll just let me
come inside with you,

203
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:48,635
I'll explain it to you.

204
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,237
Inside.

205
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,873
- Are you coming?
- Inside, Mr. McBride.

206
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:02,449
You got two minutes.

207
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:04,017
All right.

208
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:07,287
We dug this up
at Ryan Larson's house.

209
00:13:07,354 --> 00:13:08,989
It's a model and some blueprints

210
00:13:09,056 --> 00:13:11,258
for a weapons system
he was working on
for Borns Tech.

211
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:13,961
Are you trying to get
held in contempt again?

212
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:15,462
You can get disbarred

213
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:17,730
for even discussing this
with me outside the court,

214
00:13:17,865 --> 00:13:18,932
let alone argue it.

215
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:20,467
I'm not arguing anything.

216
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:23,937
You asked me a question.
I'm just answering it.

217
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:25,772
See this? I got that

218
00:13:25,873 --> 00:13:27,283
when a guy tried
to run me down today.

219
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,885
That's the same guy
who's been following me

220
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:30,243
ever since I took the case.

221
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:32,545
You're insane.

222
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:33,612
And I'm not...

223
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,882
It gets better.

224
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:36,516
Somebody broke
in my storage locker.

225
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,085
Dumped out all the discovery,

226
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,987
looking for this fucking
thing, I'm guessing.

227
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:42,122
Then you report it
to the police.

228
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:43,523
You don't bring it to me.

229
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,158
I'd love to report it
to the police,

230
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:46,535
but you see,
the police pulled me over

231
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,728
on a bullshit DUI,
beat the hell out of me,

232
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:49,796
and tased my daughter.

233
00:13:49,897 --> 00:13:51,531
Then my client gets killed

234
00:13:51,598 --> 00:13:52,900
outside your court.

235
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:54,334
They still don't have a suspect.

236
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:57,170
Two of my witnesses get
popped on a drug charge,

237
00:13:57,237 --> 00:13:59,372
Neither one has a record
for drug dealing.

238
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,909
Now, you think all
that's a coincidence?

239
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:04,444
That's a laundry
list of shit, judge.

240
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,582
What are you looking for
from me, Mr. McBride?

241
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:10,717
Huh?

242
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:11,919
My help?

243
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:13,120
The rules say that the court

244
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,754
has to retain
evidence pre-trial

245
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:16,389
if the circumstances warrant it.

246
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:19,126
As long as I tell the other
side what I'm doing,

247
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,328
you have to take this evidence.

248
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:25,632
We scoured our files,

249
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:26,967
and we didn't find anything

250
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:29,269
about what McBride
dug up in Larson's yard.

251
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:31,939
Is this a Borns Tech
weapon or not?

252
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:35,775
It's a fair question,
Wendell. Is it?

253
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:37,777
Is this thing
one of ours or not?

254
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:40,247
I deny knowing
anything about this.

255
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:44,184
The firm knows nothing.

256
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:47,054
Are you all crazy?
We're breaking the law here.

257
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:50,323
You can pretend we have
plausible deniability,

258
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,960
- but we don't.
- That's exactly what we have.

259
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:55,228
This case is only about

260
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:58,365
what caused a boat to blow up
in the middle of the night,

261
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:02,335
and for that the burden is
completely on the plaintiff.

262
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:03,770
If you were general counsel,

263
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:05,572
what would you do
with this information?

264
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:07,740
Why are you asking me?

265
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:09,876
First because
you're outside counsel.

266
00:15:09,977 --> 00:15:11,344
We pay for your advice.

267
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:14,314
Secondly, your opinion
seems to fucking matter...

268
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:16,249
not to me,
but evidently to them.

269
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:20,053
I would maintain the client's
privilege of confidentiality.

270
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,988
So you'd stay quiet as a mouse.

271
00:15:21,989 --> 00:15:23,991
I'm not a fucking mouse.

272
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:27,094
And should McBride have evidence

273
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,996
which shows
we were working up
a band cluster bomb,

274
00:15:29,997 --> 00:15:31,031
you'd still stay quiet?

275
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:33,000
There's no evidence.

276
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:34,534
It's just allegations.

277
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,069
Allegations?

278
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:40,373
Just between us lawyers,
we already know

279
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,043
Borns Tech did bad shit
and covered it up.

280
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:46,246
The law imposes a duty
on me to report this.

281
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:48,681
Yeah, and just
between us lawyers,

282
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:50,050
should somebody report it

283
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:51,718
outside this firm or Borns Tech,

284
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,254
violating the attorney-
client privilege,

285
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:57,357
somebody would lose
his law license.

286
00:15:57,424 --> 00:16:00,793
And for staying quiet,
somebody could go to prison.

287
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,362
All right, I've sat here

288
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:03,896
and listened to this bullshit

289
00:16:04,031 --> 00:16:05,311
just about long...

290
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:07,934
You've got much to think
about and consider.

291
00:16:08,035 --> 00:16:10,570
Let's all take a break.

292
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,039
Shall we?

293
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:23,083
Okay, so, assuming
we get to trial,

294
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,752
Ned is our only expert witness.

295
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:26,919
So what else?

296
00:16:27,054 --> 00:16:28,355
What else?

297
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:31,424
It's better to have one
than none, isn't it?

298
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,560
It's not how many
witnesses you have,

299
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:35,662
it's what they have
to say that counts.

300
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:38,398
Then we're really fucked
because Ned is Ned,

301
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:40,133
and the jury's
already going to hate him

302
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,301
for the revenge porn.

303
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:43,103
We may have another witness.

304
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,604
- Who?
- Right?

305
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,106
We don't have him yet.

306
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:47,974
We're going to have him.

307
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:50,543
I'll see to it if you don't.

308
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:57,417
Are you drunk?

309
00:16:57,484 --> 00:17:00,520
That's none of your
goddamn business.

310
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:03,723
You... You see this, right?

311
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:07,794
Everyone's here because of you,

312
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,097
so it is my goddamn business.

313
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:12,432
When I asked you point blank

314
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:13,942
if I should be scared
to do this case,

315
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:15,168
you said no.

316
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:17,570
Well, I'll let
you girls sit here

317
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:20,573
and dwell on your
fucking problems.

318
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:44,297
♫ Ain't it lonesome ♫

319
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:46,599

I'm not home right now,
but leave a message,

335
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:15,955
and I'll get back
to you. Thanks.

336
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:17,457

00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:32,439

♫ Mm-hmm, babe ♫

342
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:16,483
Hey, honey, what are you
doing out here?

343
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:17,917
Why didn't you knock?

344
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:19,952
I did, and I texted you.

345
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:21,454
You ready?

346
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:23,256
Yeah.

347
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,463
We're supposed to
practice driving today.

348
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:31,898
Right.

349
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:33,099
Mom won't do it,

350
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,677
and she makes me
too nervous anyway, so...

351
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:36,436
Look, there's
something I got to do,

352
00:20:36,503 --> 00:20:37,604
and I can't get out of it.

353
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,339
Are you the one Mom's dating?

354
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:40,973
Where the hell
did that come from?

355
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,742
Of course not.

356
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:44,544
She has a restraining
order against me.

357
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:46,813
- How could I be dating her?
- Yeah, now,

358
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:49,316
because you probably screwed
things up with her again.

359
00:20:50,717 --> 00:20:52,395
You two hooking up
for the sex? Is that it?

360
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:54,354
I said it's not me.

361
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:56,222
And that's creepy.

362
00:20:56,323 --> 00:20:57,690
You're my kid.
Come on.

363
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:58,891
Don't do that.

364
00:21:02,028 --> 00:21:04,130
So it really wasn't you?

365
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:06,333
No, it wasn't me.

366
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:11,971
I was kind of hoping it was.

367
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:21,348
Be nicer to Mom.

368
00:21:24,684 --> 00:21:25,952
Well, ahem,

369
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:28,788
see, I can't get within
200 yards of her,

370
00:21:28,855 --> 00:21:30,022
so...

371
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:31,223
You could start

372
00:21:31,358 --> 00:21:32,959
by dropping this case
against her firm.

373
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:36,062
It's making her crazy.

374
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,363
The case is not about me.

375
00:21:37,364 --> 00:21:38,931
The case is about a client...

376
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:40,909
- You're so full of it.
- ...and a guy who got killed.

377
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:42,369
It's all about you.

378
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:44,212
If Donald Cooperman wasn't
on the other side of this,

379
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:45,672
you wouldn't give a shit.

380
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:49,609
And you're drinking
too much again.

381
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:52,579
I can smell you.

382
00:21:55,515 --> 00:21:57,817
I'm not stupid, Dad.

383
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,488
You're sure not.

384
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:08,561
So you won't drop it?

385
00:22:10,196 --> 00:22:11,431
Not even for me?

386
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:14,901
No, I can't, honey.
I'm sorry.

387
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:17,904
Well, I don't forgive you.

388
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:38,925
Mmm.

389
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:42,862
Should we be worried,
do you think?

390
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:45,798
Leonard Letts
won't go to the FBI.

391
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:48,435
He's too scared.
He's got too much at stake.

392
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:50,970
I'd go if I were him.

393
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:52,672
Why don't you go, then?

394
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:54,240
For that matter, why don't I go?

395
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:56,643
I mean, we know
the corporation is guilty

396
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,244
of really bad stuff.

397
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,612
The only question is how much,

398
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:00,947
and we have a legal duty

399
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:02,449
to report
the corporation's crimes.

400
00:23:02,515 --> 00:23:04,250
No. I'm not sure
that we do.

401
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:06,453
It's a really gray area.

402
00:23:06,486 --> 00:23:08,287
The court says a lawyer needs

403
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:10,723
to maintain client
confidentiality,

404
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:13,593
especially when they
confess to crimes.

405
00:23:14,494 --> 00:23:15,462
Right.

406
00:23:15,495 --> 00:23:16,996
Well, some poor schmuck

407
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:18,330
is going to get convicted

408
00:23:18,465 --> 00:23:20,833
of not reporting
that corporation's crimes.

409
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,471
And then the Supreme Court
will reverse the decision

410
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:28,207
and strike down the law
in maybe ten years.

411
00:23:28,274 --> 00:23:31,077
Do you want to be that
test case? Because I don't.

412
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:32,512
And neither does Leonard.

413
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:35,147
I don't know.
He's fucked, right?

414
00:23:35,214 --> 00:23:36,483
He's just fucked.

415
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:38,217
We all are.

416
00:23:38,284 --> 00:23:43,322
Which is why we want to get
out while we still can

417
00:23:43,389 --> 00:23:45,024
and start our own thing.

418
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:47,727
Stop it. Really, you're
going to go there again?

419
00:23:47,794 --> 00:23:51,163
You got to stop. You're
like a dog with a bone.

420
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,568
Oh, shit.

421
00:23:57,504 --> 00:23:59,038
Jesus.

422
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:00,640
What are you doing home?

423
00:24:00,707 --> 00:24:03,510
Uh, I got a text to come home.

424
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:06,513
Ohh.

425
00:24:08,515 --> 00:24:10,149
Did you text her?

426
00:24:10,216 --> 00:24:12,284
She's your daughter.

427
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:14,253
She should know who you love.

428
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,523
You need to go now.

429
00:24:24,831 --> 00:24:26,065
Denise?

430
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:28,535
Baby?

431
00:24:28,568 --> 00:24:30,903
This place I've
been to many times.

432
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:34,440
And, uh, it's just,
uh... right here.

433
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:36,208
- Up the stairs?
- She's... Yep.

434
00:24:39,045 --> 00:24:41,848
Yeah, but please
don't make me do this.

435
00:24:41,914 --> 00:24:44,050
I told you we have to,
or Cooperman will.

436
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:46,018
He'll get her
to testify as a witness

437
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:47,820
that you're some kind
of a scum bag.

438
00:24:47,887 --> 00:24:50,723
Which I am. I am.
He's right.

439
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,324
Which apartment is it?

440
00:24:52,391 --> 00:24:53,660
25.

441
00:24:55,461 --> 00:24:56,729
Hey.

442
00:24:56,796 --> 00:25:00,099
Ned. What are you doing here?

443
00:25:01,901 --> 00:25:03,302
I'm Billy.
I'm a friend of Ned's.

444
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:04,980
- That's Billy.
- He just wanted to come by

445
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,405
and talk to you
for a few minutes.

446
00:25:06,472 --> 00:25:07,573
If you can just...

447
00:25:07,574 --> 00:25:09,041
I guess.

448
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:10,743
Thank you so much.

449
00:25:17,584 --> 00:25:19,586
Sorry for the intrusion,
Miss, uh...

450
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:20,887
Millie, by the way.

451
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:22,488
Absolutely.
I know all about you.

452
00:25:22,589 --> 00:25:24,223
Ned talks about you
all the time.

453
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:25,925
I'm going to go outside

454
00:25:25,992 --> 00:25:27,459
and give you guys some privacy.

455
00:25:27,594 --> 00:25:29,228
I'll just have
a smoke out there.

456
00:25:29,295 --> 00:25:31,097
Sure. Go ahead.
Okay.

457
00:25:31,163 --> 00:25:32,632
Who is this guy?

458
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:34,967
I'll explain it to you later.

459
00:25:36,936 --> 00:25:41,073
You showed our tape to people?

460
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,141
I'm so sorry.

461
00:25:43,676 --> 00:25:45,311
That was private, Ned.

462
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,412
I know.

463
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:48,347
The most private
thing I ever did.

464
00:25:48,414 --> 00:25:50,917
It's just I...
I was hurt,

465
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:52,327
and... and, you know,
I was angry...

466
00:25:52,351 --> 00:25:53,620
And the only reason I did it

467
00:25:53,653 --> 00:25:55,254
was because you begged me to.

468
00:25:56,923 --> 00:25:59,625
My parents could see that tape.

469
00:25:59,626 --> 00:26:00,693
I am so sorry.

470
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,095
- My nieces.
- I was angry.

471
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:04,530
The people I work with.

472
00:26:04,631 --> 00:26:05,632
I was hurting.

473
00:26:05,698 --> 00:26:07,133
I broke up with you

474
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:08,467
because we had no future.

475
00:26:08,534 --> 00:26:10,637
I have to get on with my life.

476
00:26:11,638 --> 00:26:15,174
I want kids, a family.

477
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:16,275
So do I.

478
00:26:16,342 --> 00:26:18,244
- Do you?
- So do I.

479
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,847
I mean, should you?

480
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:22,181
With all that mental stuff

481
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:23,716
you've got going on
in your head?

482
00:26:23,783 --> 00:26:26,118
I... I could
get help for that.

483
00:26:26,185 --> 00:26:30,056
I would if you'd
just give me a chance.

484
00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:31,223
You know? I...

485
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:34,661
I want a legacy.

486
00:26:34,694 --> 00:26:36,929
I want to have
moments with you like...

487
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:40,099
Don't you remember when
we went to Solvang?

488
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:42,935
It was a great trip.

489
00:26:43,002 --> 00:26:44,270
I loved you.

490
00:26:45,571 --> 00:26:47,006
And I still love you.

491
00:26:51,678 --> 00:26:53,680
Sorry.

492
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:56,683
Sorry to interrupt.

493
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:01,487
Listen, um,

494
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:04,791
I guess he told you
I'm an attorney.

495
00:27:04,857 --> 00:27:06,525
We really need your help.

496
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:08,695
You see, we're going
to have to get Ned

497
00:27:08,728 --> 00:27:10,462
on the stand.

498
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:11,931
And the other side,

499
00:27:11,998 --> 00:27:14,166
they're going to want
to use this videotape.

500
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:16,102
- What?
- Oh, yes, ma'am.

501
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:17,870
- They can do that?
- Of course they can.

502
00:27:17,937 --> 00:27:20,773
And they will.
We can diffuse that

503
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,308
if you just come along with us.

504
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:25,377
If you find it in your heart
to forgive Ned...

505
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:27,013
If you're by his side,

506
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:31,183
then it really makes
the tape meaningless
to them.

507
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,953
Which would be good
for you and your case.

508
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,022
I don't like being used.

509
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:37,723
I understand completely.

510
00:27:37,724 --> 00:27:39,725
Of course I want to win my case.

511
00:27:39,726 --> 00:27:42,528
I mean, selfishly, absolutely.

512
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:43,863
Ned's a good guy.

513
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:45,732
I know he cares about you.

514
00:27:45,798 --> 00:27:48,935
So above and beyond
any of this stuff,

515
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:51,871
it would just be great
to see you guys close again

516
00:27:51,938 --> 00:27:53,973
because I can tell
you love each other.

517
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:10,222
Come on, Blue!
What are you watching?

518
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:11,858
That was a strike!

519
00:28:11,924 --> 00:28:13,826
Good call, ump.

520
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:19,165
Your kid looks like
he's throwing darts.

521
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:22,201
This is baseball.
He needs to use his legs
and follow through.

522
00:28:22,268 --> 00:28:23,770
You ought to
teach him something.

523
00:28:23,836 --> 00:28:25,637
Billy, you want
a Coke or something?

524
00:28:25,772 --> 00:28:27,239
Oh, no, thanks, baby.
I'm all right.

525
00:28:30,977 --> 00:28:35,414
Ohh! Oh, God! I'm so
into this right now.

526
00:28:35,481 --> 00:28:38,785
We did the best we could,
but, as it turns out,

527
00:28:38,818 --> 00:28:40,086
you don't have a good side.

528
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:42,889
Oh, yeah! Oh, God,
it feels so good.

529
00:28:42,955 --> 00:28:44,590
My wife never sees this.

530
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:46,558
Really? She might
learn something.

531
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:47,927
Shut up, you cunt.

532
00:28:47,994 --> 00:28:49,171
Hey, there's no need for that.

533
00:28:49,195 --> 00:28:50,930
You're lucky
she's a nice person.

534
00:28:50,997 --> 00:28:52,374
I was going to just
get the information

535
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:54,333
and show this
to your wife anyway.

536
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,868
I may still do that.

537
00:28:57,703 --> 00:28:59,705
The Latin guy told me
to fuck with you.

538
00:28:59,806 --> 00:29:01,240
But he's not Latin,
or he's half...

539
00:29:01,307 --> 00:29:02,308
I don't fucking know.

540
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:04,977
His name is Karl Stoltz.

541
00:29:05,044 --> 00:29:06,445
Who does he work for?

542
00:29:06,512 --> 00:29:08,547
Borns Tech or Cooperman?

543
00:29:08,614 --> 00:29:09,548
I don't even know who that is.

544
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:10,615
I just know Stoltz.

545
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:12,351
Who does Stoltz work for?

546
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:13,619
The DEA, I think.

547
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:15,554
He's not big on information.

548
00:29:15,621 --> 00:29:16,989
The DEA. All right.

549
00:29:17,056 --> 00:29:18,825
He's an informant for 'em.

550
00:29:18,858 --> 00:29:20,402
Look, that's all
you're getting from me.

551
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:22,829
We're done.
I got nothing more.

552
00:29:23,729 --> 00:29:25,531
Envelope, please, Brittany.

553
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,399
This is all I got.

554
00:29:27,466 --> 00:29:29,701
A little subpoena for you there.

555
00:29:29,836 --> 00:29:32,638
Yeah? Well, you can
forget about it

556
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:33,873
because I ain't testifying.

557
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,507
I got a witness here.

558
00:29:36,876 --> 00:29:39,045
You'll be sorry if you
put me on the stand.

559
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:44,550
What a prick.

560
00:29:50,256 --> 00:29:52,858
♫ Baby, save it ♫

561
00:29:52,859 --> 00:29:55,027
♫ We're wasted ♫

562
00:29:58,397 --> 00:30:01,433
♫ I know we got
to slow it down ♫

563
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:04,904
I guess I'll see you later.

564
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,240
Okay. Well, can you
do me a favor

565
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:09,842
and not tell Patty
about the tape

566
00:30:09,909 --> 00:30:11,543
or what I did?

567
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:12,778
Yeah, okay.

568
00:30:12,845 --> 00:30:14,313
Yeah?

569
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,983
I wish you didn't
have to do it at all.

570
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,118
Yeah.

571
00:30:21,087 --> 00:30:23,455
You seem real busted up over it.

572
00:30:25,925 --> 00:30:27,226
It kind of doesn't make you

573
00:30:27,293 --> 00:30:29,261
any better than a pimp,
though, does it?

574
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:33,664
I'm done.

575
00:30:35,301 --> 00:30:36,502
Yeah, I know.

576
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,142
I'm gonna miss you.

577
00:30:45,411 --> 00:30:46,612
Why is that?

578
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:50,883
I love you.

579
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,885
I always have.

580
00:31:07,934 --> 00:31:10,336
If we're going to talk
about the Larson case,

581
00:31:10,402 --> 00:31:13,739
we really should invite
the trial team up.

582
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:16,175
I don't want either
Callie or Lucy here.

583
00:31:16,242 --> 00:31:18,177
I don't trust them, Donald.

584
00:31:18,244 --> 00:31:21,147
And you trust me?
Oh, that's nice.

585
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,650
Just for the record,

586
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,986
I'm... I'm shocked.

587
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:30,990
I'm shocked
at Letts' revelations

588
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:33,259
of illegality at Borns Tech.

589
00:31:34,994 --> 00:31:36,338
So what are you going
to do about it?

590
00:31:36,362 --> 00:31:38,965
In fact, I have
a luncheon appointment

591
00:31:39,031 --> 00:31:41,033
to meet with Letts
and Wendell Corey

592
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,502
to get to the bottom of things
and set things right.

593
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:45,204
How?

594
00:31:46,105 --> 00:31:49,641
It's not your concern.

595
00:31:56,215 --> 00:32:00,987
In law there is one
great eternal truth:

596
00:32:01,053 --> 00:32:02,854
If anyone goes to prison,

597
00:32:02,989 --> 00:32:05,524
it's the client, not the lawyer.

598
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:07,593
Cooperman McBride
has represented

599
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:09,461
far worse than Borns Tech

600
00:32:09,528 --> 00:32:12,031
and survived and maintained
their secrets

601
00:32:12,098 --> 00:32:14,866
and not faced a single
day in jail for it.

602
00:32:15,001 --> 00:32:18,070
Leave it to me,
or leave the firm!

603
00:32:18,137 --> 00:32:19,405
It's up to you.

604
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:21,607
We've survived
without one McBride!

605
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:23,575
We can survive without two!

606
00:32:30,016 --> 00:32:31,683
In the meantime...

607
00:32:37,923 --> 00:32:40,059
tell Billy I want to meet him.

608
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:50,136
At the old place.
He'll know where.

609
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,305
Just the two of you?

610
00:32:54,373 --> 00:32:55,373
Why?

611
00:32:59,111 --> 00:33:00,479
It's time.

612
00:33:18,364 --> 00:33:21,200
Yeah, so you got this creep
of a dirty fucking cop,

613
00:33:21,267 --> 00:33:23,902
and you got a dirty
DEA informant

614
00:33:23,969 --> 00:33:25,404
who I'm as sure as I can be

615
00:33:25,471 --> 00:33:28,140
are working for a dirty
defense contractor.

616
00:33:29,575 --> 00:33:32,478
So I'll give you all
the evidence I've got.

617
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,482
And then you guys take it
from there, you know?

618
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:39,084
Make an indictment,
root these creeps out,

619
00:33:39,085 --> 00:33:42,088
make your big, splashy
press release and all that

620
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:43,189
like you do.

621
00:33:43,255 --> 00:33:45,091
You get to fuck the DEA over,

622
00:33:45,157 --> 00:33:47,226
which I know you like to do,

623
00:33:47,293 --> 00:33:51,930
and, uh, FBI's happy,
U.S. Attorney's happy,

624
00:33:51,997 --> 00:33:53,232
and I'm happy.

625
00:33:53,299 --> 00:33:55,801
I heard you were dead.

626
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,969
Cirrhosis.

627
00:33:58,104 --> 00:33:59,238
- Really?
- Yeah.

628
00:33:59,305 --> 00:34:00,482
I'll be damned.
I didn't read that.

629
00:34:00,506 --> 00:34:01,707
- You never heard that?
- Yeah.

630
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:03,475
Ahem.

631
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:05,411
What do you want in return?

632
00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:08,114
Everything you got
on Karl Stoltz.

633
00:34:08,147 --> 00:34:09,748
Then if he's dirty,

634
00:34:09,815 --> 00:34:11,117
then maybe help me get a break

635
00:34:11,183 --> 00:34:13,419
on the Marquez brothers'
drug charge.

636
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,722
And anything you share
about Borns Tech.

637
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:20,659
Borns Tech
is a big player out here.

638
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:22,961
Lots of big government
contracts.

639
00:34:23,028 --> 00:34:24,196
Major employer, too.

640
00:34:24,263 --> 00:34:25,440
You sound like
a commercial, man.

641
00:34:25,464 --> 00:34:26,904
Are you their spokesman
or something?

642
00:34:26,965 --> 00:34:29,201
You're talking about
a long-term investigation,

643
00:34:29,268 --> 00:34:31,337
grand jury, okay?

644
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:34,406
Subpoenas, trial hours,
research.

645
00:34:34,473 --> 00:34:36,542
Yeah. That kind of stuff
that you do, right?

646
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:39,311
Your job. I'm just asking
you to work, that's all.

647
00:34:39,378 --> 00:34:41,980
I'd have to run it by
my deputy chief, at least,

648
00:34:42,047 --> 00:34:43,349
and the chief.

649
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:45,384
The U.S. Attorney. too.

650
00:34:45,451 --> 00:34:47,553
Yeah, then we got to book
grand jury time,

651
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:49,621
issue subpoenas,
talk to the D.O.D.

652
00:34:49,688 --> 00:34:51,557
All right, all right.
We'll get back to you.

653
00:34:54,993 --> 00:34:56,995
It's very interesting.

654
00:34:58,164 --> 00:35:00,732
I enjoy this room.

655
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:03,402
And this club.

656
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:05,737
They threw a dinner for me here

657
00:35:05,804 --> 00:35:09,208
when I came home in 1972.

658
00:35:10,542 --> 00:35:12,177
I think my dad was here.

659
00:35:12,178 --> 00:35:13,745
He was.

660
00:35:13,812 --> 00:35:16,815
And the President
sent a telegram.

661
00:35:16,882 --> 00:35:18,717
Can you imagine a telegram?

662
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:22,087
- Pace of progress.
- It's a beautiful room.

663
00:35:22,188 --> 00:35:23,189
Yeah, it is.

664
00:35:23,255 --> 00:35:24,490
As general counsel, Leonard,

665
00:35:24,556 --> 00:35:26,892
you were to be put up
for membership here

666
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,860
or the Jonathan Club

667
00:35:28,927 --> 00:35:30,829
if it had been your preference.

668
00:35:30,896 --> 00:35:33,399
You used the past tense.

669
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:38,370
The third past tense
conditional, I believe.

670
00:35:40,506 --> 00:35:42,941
You never took Latin, I see.

671
00:35:43,008 --> 00:35:44,876
Ah, that's not surprising.

672
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:48,514
You're being fired, Leonard.

673
00:35:51,217 --> 00:35:54,286
This is retaliation
for me asking questions

674
00:35:54,353 --> 00:35:56,522
about illegal activity
at the corporation?

675
00:35:57,656 --> 00:36:00,526
You can't fire me
for doing my job

676
00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:03,228
or following the law.
I will go to the FBI,

677
00:36:03,229 --> 00:36:05,231
and I will reveal
what I know to be true.

678
00:36:05,297 --> 00:36:07,299
I will be a whistleblower,

679
00:36:07,366 --> 00:36:10,936
and then I will sue you both
for wrongful termination,

680
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,037
and I'll win, too.

681
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:14,406
God. y-you know what?

682
00:36:14,473 --> 00:36:17,243
You should file a civil
rights claim. I would.

683
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:19,578
There's no need
to rankle, Wendell.

684
00:36:19,645 --> 00:36:22,448
There's no need
to fire you, Leonard.

685
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:23,915
You could stay with us.

686
00:36:23,982 --> 00:36:27,819
You could help us fight back
this McBride threat.

687
00:36:27,886 --> 00:36:30,589
Ship's sinking, Leonard.

688
00:36:30,656 --> 00:36:31,923
Come on.

689
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,294
There's a seat in the life boat.

690
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:39,531
Just get the fuck
on board. Okay?

691
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:43,034
It absolutely is right

692
00:36:43,101 --> 00:36:45,271
because if you're following
too closely behind the car,

693
00:36:45,304 --> 00:36:46,438
the guy wants to stop,

694
00:36:46,505 --> 00:36:48,039
and you run up his tail pipe,

695
00:36:48,106 --> 00:36:49,808
you're absolutely to blame.

696
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:52,844
All right, don't Cr...
Mama, come on.

697
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:55,180
Come on. Don't cry.
Look, I love you.

698
00:36:55,281 --> 00:36:57,416
Everybody loves you, okay?

699
00:36:57,483 --> 00:37:00,185
But you're a terrible driver.

700
00:37:00,286 --> 00:37:01,286
Okay?

701
00:37:03,188 --> 00:37:04,890
Oh. Hi.

702
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:06,825
- Hey.
- Hey, boss.

703
00:37:08,093 --> 00:37:11,630
So, uh, Mama, this is
Billy McBride, okay?

704
00:37:11,697 --> 00:37:13,699
This is Irene Papagian,
my ex-mother-in-law.

705
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:15,434
- Hi.
- These are her boys.

706
00:37:15,501 --> 00:37:17,969
Uh, she had a little bit
of a car accident.

707
00:37:18,036 --> 00:37:19,204
Oh. Sorry to hear that.

708
00:37:19,305 --> 00:37:20,639
It wasn't my fault.

709
00:37:20,706 --> 00:37:22,307
It's absolutely your fault.

710
00:37:22,308 --> 00:37:24,109
You are 100% to blame.

711
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:26,044
What's this? Just now?
What's...

712
00:37:26,111 --> 00:37:29,315
I know. Can I talk to you
just privately for a second?

713
00:37:29,348 --> 00:37:30,782
I'm sorry.

714
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:31,883
Thank you.

715
00:37:35,621 --> 00:37:37,656
Hey, listen, I know
it's your family and all,

716
00:37:37,723 --> 00:37:39,157
but I got a lot of shit to do,

717
00:37:39,224 --> 00:37:40,792
and what's wrong
with your office?

718
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,530
Okay. Um...

719
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:47,366
there's no office.
The office is gone.

720
00:37:47,433 --> 00:37:48,967
What do you mean?

721
00:37:49,034 --> 00:37:50,369
I couldn't keep up the rent,

722
00:37:50,436 --> 00:37:52,504
so I lost the office.

723
00:37:52,571 --> 00:37:54,105
Five minutes max.

724
00:37:54,172 --> 00:37:55,206
- Okay.
- Okay?

725
00:37:55,341 --> 00:37:56,475
All right.

726
00:37:56,542 --> 00:37:57,943
I'm sorry about your office.

727
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:00,579
I'm sorry.
And it's so embarrassing.

728
00:38:00,646 --> 00:38:02,213
Like, it's so embarrassing.

729
00:38:02,348 --> 00:38:03,382
Don't be embarrassed.

730
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:04,983
Just, you know, finish up,

731
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:06,718
and we'll start it later, okay?

732
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:08,820
Thank you.

733
00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:18,564
Well, I'll be damned.

734
00:38:19,898 --> 00:38:22,601
Is this some kind
of setup or something?

735
00:38:22,668 --> 00:38:25,070
You know, this is
within 200 feet.

736
00:38:26,204 --> 00:38:27,639
You should read the fine print.

737
00:38:27,706 --> 00:38:29,608
The TR is for the house, dummy,

738
00:38:29,675 --> 00:38:31,843
not for me.
Plus, I'm on my own.

739
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,579
Uh, can I get
a Jack Daniels, please?

740
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:34,713
- You got it.
- Thanks.

741
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,947
What happened to your hand?

742
00:38:36,014 --> 00:38:38,584
Uh, just fucking around.
Sprained my wrist.

743
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:39,718
Thanks.

744
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:41,920
So what's up?

745
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:42,987
Mm.

746
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:45,657
Cooperman.

747
00:38:45,724 --> 00:38:47,793
He wants to see you tonight.

748
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:49,395
He said you'd know where.

749
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,165
Yeah, I know where.

750
00:38:54,232 --> 00:38:56,602
So he couldn't call me himself?

751
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:58,269
Sends you down here

752
00:38:58,404 --> 00:39:00,005
like you're a fucking runner?

753
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:02,541
Arrogant son of a bitch.

754
00:39:02,608 --> 00:39:04,676
Denise knows about Callie.

755
00:39:05,577 --> 00:39:06,745
What, did you tell her?

756
00:39:07,879 --> 00:39:09,648
Nope. Callie did

757
00:39:09,715 --> 00:39:13,018
in a really,
really unhealthy way.

758
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:15,487
I can't imagine Callie
telling anybody

759
00:39:15,554 --> 00:39:17,422
in a... in a healthy way.

760
00:39:17,423 --> 00:39:18,957
It's who she is.

761
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:22,561
You know, I never wanted
to be with a lawyer.

762
00:39:22,628 --> 00:39:24,896
- Thanks.
- But I always end up with one.

763
00:39:24,963 --> 00:39:27,098
Why is that?

764
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:28,500
I don't know, convenience?

765
00:39:28,567 --> 00:39:30,436
Always one right down the hall.

766
00:39:40,446 --> 00:39:42,514
Then this woman came over.

767
00:39:42,581 --> 00:39:44,816
I have her card
somewhere in the house.

768
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:47,553
I forget her name.

769
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:50,221
Do you remember what she said?

770
00:39:50,288 --> 00:39:51,657
I kept asking her
to repeat herself

771
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:53,124
because I couldn't
fucking believe

772
00:39:53,191 --> 00:39:54,493
what she was telling me.

773
00:39:55,861 --> 00:39:57,696
They're calling in the loan.

774
00:39:58,697 --> 00:40:00,131
Borns cosigned on the house

775
00:40:00,198 --> 00:40:01,399
when Ryan joined them.

776
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:03,711
And they emptied
the trust account.

777
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:05,095
That... That's
for Jason's college.

778
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:06,137
Can they do that?

779
00:40:06,204 --> 00:40:07,739
They can't do that, right?

780
00:40:07,806 --> 00:40:09,675
Actually, yeah, they can.

781
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:12,410
I can't lose this house.

782
00:40:13,945 --> 00:40:15,447
How am I going to pay
for college?

783
00:40:15,514 --> 00:40:16,674
We just have to win the case.

784
00:40:16,715 --> 00:40:18,617
Well, we're going to try.

785
00:40:18,684 --> 00:40:21,653
You will win, right?

786
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,754
Yeah.

787
00:40:32,964 --> 00:40:35,433
They don't even make
fucking adults anymore.

788
00:40:35,501 --> 00:40:38,069
These little privileged shits.

789
00:40:38,136 --> 00:40:40,806
Everybody's a fucking pussy.

790
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:43,875
You can't say shit to anybody.

791
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:45,820
You can't even be a fucking
human being anymore.

792
00:40:45,844 --> 00:40:47,045
You know what I'm saying?

793
00:40:48,814 --> 00:40:51,550
How are you supposed
to be a human being?

794
00:40:51,617 --> 00:40:54,319
30 fucking years
in the Bar, you know?

795
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,754
Not this fucking bar.

796
00:40:56,755 --> 00:40:58,423
30 years of the law.

797
00:40:58,524 --> 00:41:00,391
30 fucking years.

798
00:41:00,526 --> 00:41:03,028
Never turned in
a dishonest day in court.

799
00:41:03,094 --> 00:41:04,530
Not fucking once.

800
00:41:04,596 --> 00:41:06,397
You can check
the trial transcripts

801
00:41:06,532 --> 00:41:08,967
and see for yourself.

802
00:41:09,034 --> 00:41:10,669
Know something else?

803
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:14,673
I wouldn't change
a fucking thing.

804
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,307
I wouldn't...
I wouldn't change

805
00:41:16,374 --> 00:41:18,276
a fucking thing, Frankie.

806
00:41:18,343 --> 00:41:19,945
Did you know that?

807
00:41:20,011 --> 00:41:21,012
Because I lived.

808
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:23,114
See, people don't
fucking live anymore.

809
00:41:23,181 --> 00:41:26,051
You can't fucking say anything
that's politically incorrect.

810
00:41:26,117 --> 00:41:27,352
Rumor is you're off the wagon.

811
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:29,454
...fucking do anything.

812
00:41:29,555 --> 00:41:31,056
No, no, I'm still on the wagon.

813
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:34,926
I just got a designated driver.

814
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:35,993
Right.

815
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:39,430
So what are you doing here?

816
00:41:39,565 --> 00:41:40,632
I don't understand.

817
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:42,367
I will carry you
through the Larson case,

818
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:43,669
and then I'm out for reals.

819
00:41:43,735 --> 00:41:45,336
I can't keep doing this.

820
00:41:45,403 --> 00:41:47,372
I never heard that before.

821
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:48,774
You'll carry me?

822
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,809
How many fucking times
you gonna quit anyway?

823
00:41:50,876 --> 00:41:52,744
It's my own goddamn fault.

824
00:41:52,811 --> 00:41:53,912
I should have never agreed

825
00:41:53,979 --> 00:41:55,881
to take this fucking
thing on anyway.

826
00:41:58,216 --> 00:42:00,886
You know you have a meeting
with Donald Cooperman?

827
00:42:02,921 --> 00:42:04,322
- He called, huh?
- Yeah.

828
00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:05,924
Yeah, he must want something.

829
00:42:05,991 --> 00:42:07,458
Well, you can't go like this.

830
00:42:07,593 --> 00:42:09,227
What, you me to put a tuxedo on?

831
00:42:09,294 --> 00:42:11,072
I'm not gonna crawl
over there to that motherfucker

832
00:42:11,096 --> 00:42:14,666
and, you know, fuckin' run over
to that son of a bitch

833
00:42:14,733 --> 00:42:16,334
like a fucking puppy.
Forget it.

834
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:18,436
- Hey. Hey.
- What?

835
00:42:19,605 --> 00:42:21,907
You love me?

836
00:42:23,341 --> 00:42:25,711
Oh. Fuck. Uh, look...

837
00:42:26,912 --> 00:42:29,615
honey, of course I love you.

838
00:42:29,681 --> 00:42:31,116
I love everybody.

839
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:36,287
Can we get this guy
a coffee, please?

840
00:42:43,361 --> 00:42:45,230
Still alive, I see.

841
00:42:49,334 --> 00:42:51,236
What's up, G-man?

842
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:52,638
Where's your sidekick?

843
00:42:52,671 --> 00:42:55,206
He's at home asleep
sucking his thumb.

844
00:42:55,273 --> 00:42:56,407
He's a pussy.

845
00:42:56,474 --> 00:42:57,976
He seemed like it.

846
00:42:58,043 --> 00:43:00,912
But he's interested
in your case.

847
00:43:00,979 --> 00:43:01,847
No shit.

848
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:03,715
No shit.
He needs a big case

849
00:43:03,782 --> 00:43:05,550
so he can land a offer
at Kirkland & Ellis

850
00:43:05,651 --> 00:43:07,118
or go in house at Boeing.

851
00:43:07,185 --> 00:43:09,120
He's an ambitious little fuck.

852
00:43:09,187 --> 00:43:10,421
You know how it is.

853
00:43:10,488 --> 00:43:12,157
Yeah, I do.

854
00:43:12,223 --> 00:43:14,325
Still, that's good news.

855
00:43:14,392 --> 00:43:15,694
Sure about that?

856
00:43:15,761 --> 00:43:17,361
If the U.S. Attorney's
office takes over,

857
00:43:17,395 --> 00:43:19,030
who's in charge, you?

858
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:22,668
So I get nothing?

859
00:43:26,738 --> 00:43:28,273
It's Karl Stoltz.

860
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:30,008
Don't forget we helped.

861
00:43:30,075 --> 00:43:33,011
We may need you if we
ever indict anybody.

862
00:43:33,078 --> 00:43:36,014
You were right.
He's dirtier than shit.

863
00:43:36,081 --> 00:43:38,083
Before he was a DEA informant,

864
00:43:38,149 --> 00:43:39,150
he worked with us.

865
00:43:39,217 --> 00:43:41,887
We dropped him because
he was making shit up.

866
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:44,756
When the DEA drops him,
the ATF will pick him up.

867
00:43:44,823 --> 00:43:46,391
Way of the world.

868
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:48,960
You didn't get this from me.

869
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:53,198
Why am I getting anything?

870
00:43:53,264 --> 00:43:55,533
Why do you think?

871
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,402
I fucking hate the DEA.

872
00:43:58,837 --> 00:44:00,571
I hate lawyers, too.

873
00:44:00,706 --> 00:44:03,742
That doesn't mean I think
they should get run over.

874
00:44:04,743 --> 00:44:06,712
Yeah, well, I appreciate that.

875
00:46:18,476 --> 00:46:20,378
Okay, Donnie, what do you want?

876
00:46:21,712 --> 00:46:24,315
It's just amazing
after all these years.

877
00:46:26,417 --> 00:46:29,120
I have a deep capacity
for hate myself,

878
00:46:29,187 --> 00:46:33,324
but yours...
yours is impressive.

879
00:46:33,391 --> 00:46:35,093
I don't hate you.

880
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,062
That would take too much effort.

881
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:39,764
But I'm glad to see
your ego's still intact.

882
00:46:39,865 --> 00:46:42,901
Is that what you tell yourself?

883
00:46:42,968 --> 00:46:45,036
That the opposite of love is...

884
00:46:46,237 --> 00:46:48,339
is not hate.
It's indifference.

885
00:46:49,875 --> 00:46:52,310
I don't believe
that you're indifferent.

886
00:46:59,217 --> 00:47:01,953
Did I ever tell you
that I fucked your wife?

887
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:05,123
Before you knew her.

888
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:06,624
And after.

889
00:47:06,691 --> 00:47:08,026
Okay.

890
00:47:08,093 --> 00:47:10,161
That's all you have to say?

891
00:47:13,231 --> 00:47:14,900
I never could rattle you.

892
00:47:14,966 --> 00:47:16,902
And I'm good at rattling people.

893
00:47:18,103 --> 00:47:20,972
But you see right through me,

894
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:22,974
and I respect that.

895
00:47:24,475 --> 00:47:25,911
What I didn't respect

896
00:47:25,977 --> 00:47:29,047
is your inability
to be a real lawyer.

897
00:47:30,916 --> 00:47:34,152
Yes, you won a few cases.

898
00:47:35,653 --> 00:47:37,088
Showboat.

899
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:44,195
I built a business.

900
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,568
A culture.

901
00:47:50,635 --> 00:47:52,937
A company.

902
00:47:52,938 --> 00:47:55,506
A law firm.

903
00:47:55,573 --> 00:47:59,377
You were a drunk with talent

904
00:47:59,444 --> 00:48:02,013
who got lucky.

905
00:48:03,949 --> 00:48:06,151
You're playing with fire, Billy.

906
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:13,524
Borns Tech is not some
goddamn insurance company.

907
00:48:13,591 --> 00:48:17,662
Think about what's
gone down in this case

908
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:22,000
and ask yourself how much
more of it you can take,

909
00:48:22,067 --> 00:48:24,970
how many more people
are going to get hurt.

910
00:48:25,003 --> 00:48:31,242
Consider... one dead client.

911
00:48:31,309 --> 00:48:33,444
A DUI.

912
00:48:33,511 --> 00:48:36,982
You were almost
run down in the street.

913
00:48:38,683 --> 00:48:40,218
It was terrible.

914
00:48:42,853 --> 00:48:44,022
Don't look at me.

915
00:48:44,089 --> 00:48:45,991
Did I say I did it?

916
00:48:48,693 --> 00:48:51,029
To acknowledge that a crime
has been committed

917
00:48:51,096 --> 00:48:52,263
or will be committed

918
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:53,564
is not in itself a crime.

919
00:48:53,631 --> 00:48:55,133
You of all people
should know that.

920
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,443
That killer that you
sprung... Bender...

921
00:48:56,467 --> 00:48:58,903
you knew he was
guilty of murder.

922
00:48:59,004 --> 00:49:01,005
You knew he was
likely to murder again,

923
00:49:01,006 --> 00:49:02,740
but you got him off anyway,

924
00:49:02,807 --> 00:49:04,109
and he killed...

925
00:49:08,013 --> 00:49:10,281
that beautiful,
beautiful family.

926
00:49:11,349 --> 00:49:13,618
I don't kill innocent
people, Billy.

927
00:49:13,684 --> 00:49:15,153
You do.

928
00:49:16,187 --> 00:49:18,356
That's why you live in a bottle.

929
00:49:18,423 --> 00:49:21,626
That's why you destroyed
your marriage, your family.

930
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:26,031
So I take it there's no
offer on the table.

931
00:49:26,064 --> 00:49:29,534
There's always an offer
on the table, Billy boy.

932
00:49:33,871 --> 00:49:35,573
How about nothing?

933
00:49:37,442 --> 00:49:41,479
You withdraw everything,
admit you were wrong...

934
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,882
give up your law license,

935
00:49:44,949 --> 00:49:47,051
give me title to your car,

936
00:49:47,052 --> 00:49:49,254
and you let me
fuck you up the ass.

937
00:49:54,125 --> 00:49:56,127
Don't forget, legally,

938
00:49:56,194 --> 00:50:01,132
you have to convey
the offer to the client.

939
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:16,147
I gave this to your assistant.

940
00:50:17,382 --> 00:50:19,317
But the fact that you
didn't complain

941
00:50:19,384 --> 00:50:21,586
tells me that you
told her to ignore it.

942
00:50:21,652 --> 00:50:23,954
Can you prove that?

943
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:26,291
No.

944
00:50:26,357 --> 00:50:27,792
I can't.

945
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:31,028
Ahem.

946
00:50:35,233 --> 00:50:37,068
But I can prove I served you.

947
00:50:38,403 --> 00:50:40,371
I'm not accepting this service

948
00:50:40,438 --> 00:50:42,507
on behalf of my assistant.

949
00:50:42,573 --> 00:50:44,475
That's okay.
You don't have to.

950
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:47,412
It's not for her.
It's for you.

951
00:50:47,478 --> 00:50:49,080
Oh.

952
00:50:49,147 --> 00:50:51,649
And I do see right through you.

953
00:50:51,716 --> 00:50:54,119
I've never seen you
this scared before,

954
00:50:54,185 --> 00:50:56,454
you son of a bitch.

955
00:55:13,778 --> 00:55:14,778
You stinker!

956
