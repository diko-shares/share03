Stop it!

00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,110
Enough!

4
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,109
I'll kill myself if you go.

5
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,171
Do it for once. Drop dead.

6
00:04:26,193 --> 00:04:28,293
We'll be off. It takes ages

7

Will Mum die?

10
00:05:35,246 --> 00:05:37,443
No, of course not

11
00:05:39,643 --> 00:05:41,271
She's just depressed

12
00:05:42,187 --> 00:05:43,267
Anyway, it's her fault

13
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:46,332
She always gets in a mess.

14
00:06:39,123 --> 00:06:40,065
Here's your bed.

15
00:06:47,223 --> 00:06:48,243
It's not a bedroom.

16
00:06:49,174 --> 00:06:51,075
I haven't much room, you know

17
00:06:56,147 --> 00:06:58,732
Besides, you won't be here long.

18
00:08:38,274 --> 00:08:40,042
You got stuck with the kid?

19
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,813
Ssh. You'll wake her up.

20
00:08:50,245 --> 00:08:52,110
Mimi

21
00:09:46,521 --> 00:09:47,446
Stop

22
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:05,110
Mimi, can you give me a hand?

23
00:10:10,232 --> 00:10:11,132
Help me

24
00:10:14,001 --> 00:10:15,512
I'll make your breakfast soon

25
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,513
Sleep well?

26
00:10:25,112 --> 00:10:26,189
What's that?

27
00:10:26,589 --> 00:10:29,223
Just some blood. Don't worry

28
00:10:29,598 --> 00:10:30,832
Your turn will come

29
00:10:35,112 --> 00:10:36,812

Where do you live, Mimi?

33
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:06,758
In the south.

34
00:11:06,998 --> 00:11:08,112
Ah, the sourthern suburbs

35
00:11:09,189 --> 00:11:10,224
It's cleaner than here.

36
00:11:11,298 --> 00:11:12,189
Yes.

37
00:11:13,612 --> 00:11:14,412
Even so

38
00:11:15,198 --> 00:11:17,189
Be nice and polite to everyone

39
00:11:19,701 --> 00:11:21,589
Good day, sir. Goodbye madam

40
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:25,312
It's important. Understand?

41
00:11:57,224 --> 00:11:58,332
Are you Portuguese?

42
00:11:59,597 --> 00:12:00,521
Spanish?

43
00:12:01,697 --> 00:12:02,798
Breton?

44
00:12:03,512 --> 00:12:05,312
I'm French.

45
00:12:06,611 --> 00:12:07,517
May I?

46
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,100
You're very beautiful.

47
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:29,510
Don't touch. It's not a toy

48
00:12:30,589 --> 00:12:33,100
She's my favourite. Don't move her

49
00:12:34,189 --> 00:12:37,112
You've got dolls. Lots of them

50
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:42,110
All these things are presents

51
00:12:43,011 --> 00:12:46,112
Each has its place. Don't touch

52
00:12:46,498 --> 00:12:48,110
Play in your corner over there

53
00:12:52,111 --> 00:12:54,128
Don't move things

54
00:12:54,397 --> 00:12:55,835
It's not your home.

55
00:14:04,112 --> 00:14:07,221
Hi, Solange. I wanted to see you

56
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:09,112
I've got up a petition

58
00:14:11,997 --> 00:14:14,110
Filthy lot. I want you to sign

59
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:17,112
It's getting unbearable.

60
00:14:17,597 --> 00:14:18,956
Give it here.

61
00:14:19,597 --> 00:14:23,257
Come for a drink, I'll fill you in.

62
00:14:28,721 --> 00:14:30,921
Sorry love. I've no Fanta

63
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:33,110
I wasn't expecting you.

64
00:14:33,896 --> 00:14:35,357
It's signed.

65
00:14:35,397 --> 00:14:37,110
Nice of you

66
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,810
Here's to love

67
00:14:40,597 --> 00:14:43,110
I saw your new boyfriend

68
00:14:44,112 --> 00:14:45,778
He's a dish.

69
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,225
Well, I like him.

70
00:14:50,113 --> 00:14:51,336
Is he nice to you?

71
00:14:51,797 --> 00:14:53,114
Yes, alright.

72
00:14:54,623 --> 00:14:57,312
Good. I'm happy for you

73
00:15:00,321 --> 00:15:02,113
But watch out, though

74
00:15:04,332 --> 00:15:08,624
Because he's younger than you

75
00:15:08,912 --> 00:15:10,642
You know what men are like

76
00:15:12,114 --> 00:15:14,810
What's new is nice but then...

77
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,110
They start looking around.

78
00:15:21,413 --> 00:15:22,224
<i>And now...</i>

79
00:15:22,697 --> 00:15:24,114
<i>...You must clearly visualize...</i>

80
00:15:24,997 --> 00:15:28,445
<i>...the negative agent aggresing you</i>

81
00:15:29,424 --> 00:15:31,313
<i>With all your strength...</i>

82
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:33,668
<i>...you are destroying it</i>

83
00:15:34,714 --> 00:15:37,812
<i>It is getting weaker and weaker</i>

84
00:15:38,513 --> 00:15:41,124
<i>Getting smaller and smaller</i>

85
00:15:43,121 --> 00:15:44,913
<i>It has nearly disappeared</i>

86
00:15:45,898 --> 00:15:47,334

87
00:15:49,814 --> 00:15:52,223
<i>Feel your victory</i>

88
00:15:53,113 --> 00:15:54,221
<i>In your body</i>

89
00:15:55,813 --> 00:15:57,112
<i>Don't hesitate to smile</i>

90
00:15:57,698 --> 00:15:59,910
<i>And let flow through you...</i>

91
00:16:00,497 --> 00:16:02,443
<i>...positive vibes</i>

92
00:16:04,312 --> 00:16:06,143
<i>You are...</i>

93
00:16:07,112 --> 00:16:09,213
<i>...and extraordinary factory...</i>

94
00:16:09,397 --> 00:16:11,524
<i>...of natural medicine.</i>

95
00:16:18,714 --> 00:16:22,110
- Grandma, what big ears you have!
- All the better to hear you with.

96
00:16:22,997 --> 00:16:26,110
- Grandma, what big teeth you have!
- All the better to eat you with.

97
00:16:26,997 --> 00:16:31,121
Then the big bad wolf jumped on
Little Red Riding Hood and ate her.

98
00:16:33,413 --> 00:16:34,532
Phone!

99
00:16:42,214 --> 00:16:43,332
Ah, Jean-Pierre

100
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:54,223
It's not a good time

101
00:17:03,112 --> 00:17:04,445
Hold on.

102
00:17:06,421 --> 00:17:08,514

106
00:18:07,224 --> 00:18:10,112

107
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,557

108
00:18:14,315 --> 00:18:17,110
<i>Our second case is the murder

00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:20,757
<i>She was raped and stabbed
near Bourges</i>

110
00:18:22,115 --> 00:18:24,111
<i>And we'll end with a final
question</i>

111
00:18:24,997 --> 00:18:27,221
<i>What should we do with
child murderers?</i>

112
00:18:30,512 --> 00:18:32,415
I'd ream guys like that

113
00:18:34,511 --> 00:18:37,211
Death penalty. No question.

114
00:18:37,597 --> 00:18:40,514
<i>...these crimes which appal
public opinion.</i>

115
00:18:42,115 --> 00:18:45,711

divorced his father</i>

<i>He had been jailed on

118
00:18:52,497 --> 00:18:54,916
<i>Eric would never know him</i>

119
00:18:56,912 --> 00:19:00,911
<i>Even in his teens, Eric was
attracted to young boys...</i>

120
00:19:01,397 --> 00:19:02,957
Stop that with your nails

121
00:19:05,114 --> 00:19:06,423
Stop it.

122
00:19:12,221 --> 00:19:14,511
Can I watch TV with you?

123
00:19:15,198 --> 00:19:19,116
No, it's too late.
And it's not for little girls.

<i>...He felt hurt, so he wanted to
make contact with a child.</i>

125
00:19:29,112 --> 00:19:31,111

a euphemism</i>

Mimi, move

135
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:31,553
OK, take your dolls

136
00:20:33,721 --> 00:20:35,132
Go and play in the hall.

You put me through hell today

Imagine if I told your mother

152

She'd be furious, you know.

153
00:23:32,921 --> 00:23:34,522
Why get so upset?

154

I can't stand that kid.

What's wrong?

156

Ask her what she was doing with

Not Portuguese, American.

What did you go for?

165
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,616
I didn't do anything.

166
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:46,710
I'll tell him

Well?

184
00:28:38,998 --> 00:28:41,225
Nothing. She's asleep again

It can't be easy for her.

00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:27,332
No. She's probably not well.

188
00:29:29,511 --> 00:29:31,143
Not well, my foot.

189
00:29:35,221 --> 00:29:37,226
I have to go

190
00:29:40,132 --> 00:29:42,221
Stay with Jean-Pierre today.

191
00:29:43,425 --> 00:29:46,223
She'll be in hospital for ever.

192
00:29:49,542 --> 00:29:51,121
Can I phone her?

193
00:29:51,398 --> 00:29:53,556
Yes, but do it straight away.

194
00:29:55,154 --> 00:29:56,358
I can see her point

195
00:29:57,542 --> 00:29:59,142
Board and lodging on the state

196
00:30:05,321 --> 00:30:07,111
And that way she's not alone.

197
00:30:19,921 --> 00:30:21,448
I hope you'll be fine

198
00:30:22,122 --> 00:30:23,921
Here's your daughter.

199
00:30:29,221 --> 00:30:31,227
Mum, are you alright?

200
00:30:35,901 --> 00:30:38,320
Are you staying there long?

201
00:30:42,802 --> 00:30:46,112
Yes, but will you be back soon?

202
00:31:02,101 --> 00:31:03,220
A big kiss.

203
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,554
See you tonight.

204
00:32:12,103 --> 00:32:13,679
Alright, dollies?

205
00:32:15,812 --> 00:32:18,677
Virginie, are you going with Kate?

206
00:32:19,824 --> 00:32:22,721
You look pretty like that

207
00:32:24,412 --> 00:32:26,743
Are you going with Guillaume?

208
00:32:27,897 --> 00:32:29,521
Wearing your evening dress?

209
00:32:29,997 --> 00:32:32,112
Are you babysitting Céline?

210
00:32:32,996 --> 00:32:33,997
I see

211
00:32:35,221 --> 00:32:37,453
What are you doing, Virginie?

212
00:32:49,812 --> 00:32:51,667
Your dolls are very pretty

213
00:32:56,512 --> 00:32:58,944
Aren't you a bit old for dolls?

214
00:33:08,832 --> 00:33:10,443
This one's pretty

215
00:33:14,122 --> 00:33:15,557
She even has breasts

216
00:33:27,921 --> 00:33:29,223
Are you happy here?

217
00:33:29,497 --> 00:33:30,796
Yes.

218
00:33:35,812 --> 00:33:37,413
Aunt Solange is strict

219
00:33:41,814 --> 00:33:43,115
And she's a bit fussy

220
00:33:43,997 --> 00:33:45,776
You can't leave dolls around

221
00:34:12,923 --> 00:34:15,335
Cat got your tongue?

222
00:34:21,521 --> 00:34:23,556
Do you feel good?

223
00:34:27,122 --> 00:34:29,142
I could be your friend

224
00:34:30,312 --> 00:34:32,221
Would you like that?

225
00:34:42,114 --> 00:34:43,614
Pretty blonde hair

226
00:34:45,112 --> 00:34:46,424
Like gold

227
00:34:48,843 --> 00:34:50,257
Look at me

228
00:34:54,742 --> 00:34:56,396
D'you think I'm nice?

229
00:35:17,944 --> 00:35:20,321
Not saying anything?

230
00:35:23,143 --> 00:35:25,101
I'll be nice to you

231
00:35:25,912 --> 00:35:27,676
Look at me

232
00:35:37,624 --> 00:35:39,443
A little kiss?

233
00:35:47,921 --> 00:35:49,476
A little kiss?

234
00:35:58,124 --> 00:36:00,245
Give me a kiss

235
00:36:00,797 --> 00:36:02,476
I don't want to hurt you

236
00:36:02,797 --> 00:36:04,779
I won't hurt you

237
00:36:11,221 --> 00:36:12,556
Kiss me

238
00:36:17,201 --> 00:36:18,200
Kiss me

239
00:36:19,124 --> 00:36:20,447
Kiss me

240
00:36:22,321 --> 00:36:24,845
Fuck it! You piss me off!

241
00:36:58,101 --> 00:37:00,542
Don't think of telling Solange.

242
00:38:07,112 --> 00:38:08,129
Mimi?

243
00:38:23,413 --> 00:38:24,924
What is it now?

244
00:38:25,499 --> 00:38:27,265
There's no end to it

245
00:38:28,824 --> 00:38:30,414
I've called you three times

246
00:38:31,397 --> 00:38:33,947
Dinner's ready. Jean-Pierre made it.

247
00:38:34,597 --> 00:38:35,777
He's a queer.

248
00:38:40,812 --> 00:38:42,121
Get going.

249
00:38:56,914 --> 00:38:58,414
I made a nice little chicken

250
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:01,714
Grain-fed, organic or something

251
00:39:02,814 --> 00:39:04,117
What does she like?

252
00:39:04,597 --> 00:39:05,817
The leg.

253
00:39:23,114 --> 00:39:24,916
I'm not hungry.

254
00:39:25,117 --> 00:39:26,246
Eat it up.

255
00:39:26,396 --> 00:39:27,826
Delicious chicken.

256
00:39:29,542 --> 00:39:32,642
My tummy aches.
Take me to hospital.

257
00:39:32,896 --> 00:39:34,921
You don't go to hospital
for that.

258
00:39:36,101 --> 00:39:37,814
It really hurts.

259
00:39:38,577 --> 00:39:41,214
If you won't eat, go to bed

260
00:39:45,312 --> 00:39:46,977
It'll be better tomorrow.

261
00:41:49,115 --> 00:41:51,117
Can you take me to hospital?

262
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,225
Go home.

263
00:43:18,726 --> 00:43:19,825
Wow

264
00:43:19,996 --> 00:43:21,697
You even wash up.

265
00:46:05,812 --> 00:46:07,525
I won't hurt you

266
00:46:08,315 --> 00:46:09,524
Kiss me.

267
00:47:33,201 --> 00:47:36,112
Well, I've pumped her stomach

268
00:47:37,914 --> 00:47:39,115
She's much better

269
00:47:40,512 --> 00:47:43,714
She'll have to see a psychologist.

270
00:48:22,114 --> 00:48:24,115
I don't want to go back there

271
00:48:27,312 --> 00:48:28,917
I don't want to.

272
00:48:44,114 --> 00:48:48,815
MORAL

273
00:48:57,715 --> 00:49:00,216
Doctors dream up such shit.

274
00:49:17,114 --> 00:49:19,220
I can't keep her

275
00:49:19,597 --> 00:49:21,337
We'll put her somewhere.

276
00:49:56,904 --> 00:49:59,116
We can always go and see her.
