1
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.300
--an unprecedented meteor shower

2
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.300
falling off the coast of Tokyo.

3
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.430
The entire city is mesmerised

4
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.430
by this incredible sight.

5
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.890
Two hours after the first contact...

6
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.100
...an unidentified enemy

7
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.100
has reached our coastlines...

8
00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.440
...in a swift and militaristic attack.

9
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.280
Right now, one thing is clear:

10
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.280
The world is at war.

11
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.130
At 14:46 Pacific Standard Time...

12
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.050
... 12 different locations

13
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.050
across the globe were breached...

14
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.720
...in a coordinated attack

15
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.720
by an unknown enemy.

16
00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.560
All breaches were

17
00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.560
along the coastline...

18
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.270
...in what is a campaign

19
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.270
of rapid dominance.

20
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.190
This is a textbook military invasion.

21
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.230
There are massive casualties

22
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.230
in New York.

23
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.650
Defensive lines

24
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.650
are being set up in Boston.

25
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.530
And at 13:15 Zulu time,

26
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.530
we lost communications...

27
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.990
...with San Francisco and San Diego.

28
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.410
Their status is unknown.

29
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.750
What we know is that we are the last

30
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.750
offensive force on the West Coast.

31
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.880
We cannot lose Los Angeles.

32
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.470
We have five birds down

33
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.470
two klicks west of CP Victory.

34
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.970
We're hit, we're hit! Tighten

35
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.970
your asses, we're going down!

36
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.850
Command and control is down.

37
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.310
Civilians in need of support

38
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.310
two klicks northeast.

39
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.860
Cables inbound.

40
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.860
Engage your sectors of fire, over.

41
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.070
Oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit.

42
00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.180
Good morning. 94.5 with the Surfrider

43
00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.180
Foundation Morning Surf Report.

44
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.560
Surfers, hard northeast conditions

45
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.560
blowing out there...

46
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.280
...the ocean slopping and chopping.

47
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.280
There is some size starting to build....

48
00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.650
Come on. Come on.

49
00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.420
-Morning, staff sergeant.

50
00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.420
-Morning, sergeant.

51
00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.180
Morning, staff sergeant.

52
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.600
-Morning, sergeant.

53
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.600
-Morning, staff sergeant.

54
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.640
Morning, staff sergeant.

55
00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.440
Morning, you little prick.

56
00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.630
You know what they say. You're only

57
00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.630
as old as you feel, staff sergeant.

58
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.590
That's what I'm worried about.

59
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.590
I can't feel a damn thing.

60
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.810
--to the Pacific for our next report,

61
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.810
where a cluster of meteors...

62
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.520
...is predicted to enter our atmosphere

63
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.520
in the early hours tomorrow morning.

64
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:52.770
Go ahead.

65
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.980
They're expected to strike miles

66
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.980
from land, far into the Pacific Ocean.

67
00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.450
-John.

68
00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.450
-Oh, God.

69
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.200
What's up, Mike?

70
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.370
Hey. What happened to that picture

71
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.370
of us in Iraq with that camel?

72
00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.290
I mean, your girlfriend.

73
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.460
Hey, is this for real?

74
00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.540
It's got your signature. I said, "That's

75
00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.540
gotta be a mistake. He can't write."

76
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.670
No mistake, John. I did my 20.

77
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.670
I know when to get out.

78
00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.260
Come on. You got the box full of

79
00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.260
medals, a file full of commendations.

80
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.100
You can have them.

81
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.100
Seems you like interior decorating.

82
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.060
A Marine's got a shelf life, you know?

83
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.060
After that....

84
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.560
What? He spoils?

85
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.350
Something like that.

86
00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.190
I'll finish my training assignment

87
00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.190
with these Marines.

88
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.980
Get them combat ready.

89
00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.650
And then I'll be on my merry way.

90
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.990
You know, we could always use

91
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.990
another lean, mean typing machine.

92
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.990
Shit, I ain't built like you, John.

93
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.330
Ugly, slow, soft.

94
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.790
God.

95
00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.090
You had to make some

96
00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.090
tough calls there, Mike.

97
00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.460
Especially that last one.

98
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.510
We all wish your men made it home.

99
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.430
Here we go.

100
00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.690
You're expired.

101
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.360
Clear the shelf...

102
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.950
...staff sergeant.

103
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.130
Everything I know is in here, John.

104
00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.360
What typically would have been

105
00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.360
detected months, if not years, before...

106
00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.690
...surfaced in less than four hours.

107
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.780
These images giving some idea of

108
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.780
the rate these meteors are travelling.

109
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.830
Scientists are abuzz,

110
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.830
scrambling to try and understand it.

111
00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.330
There's something just

112
00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.330
extremely uncomfortable...

113
00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.830
...about a man your size

114
00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.830
sniffing a flower.

115
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.960
What you want is some hydrangeas.

116
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.840
Popular wedding flower,

117
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.840
come in green, blue.

118
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.420
What colour is

119
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.420
the bridesmaids' dresses?

120
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.630
-Good question.

121
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.630
-You're amazing. Take a whiff. Smell it.

122
00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:31.350
Yes, pretty girl?

123
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.220
For 300 more, she said we could have

124
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.220
sprays of lilies.

125
00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.690
Now, I know it's a lot, but it'd be

126
00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.690
so beautiful. What do you think?

127
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.480
300 dollars? Goodness gracious.

128
00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:44.610
It's a no-brainer. You're only getting

129
00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:44.610
married once. Worry about 300 bucks?

130
00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.780
-Thank you, Stavrou. Thank you.

131
00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.780
-Yeah, no worries.

132
00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:53.200
You know what? It's your day.

133
00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:53.200
Do whatever you want.

134
00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.540
I'm gonna hit you with something.

135
00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.540
What are you doing?

136
00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:58.790
Busting your balls.

137
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.500
Tomorrow we shop for cakes.

138
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:02.540
And I can't wait.

139
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:03.920
I love cake.

140
00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:18.180
Yo, Doc. What you doing?

141
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:19.440
Skyping back home.

142
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.520
Is that your girlfriend? Damn, she fine.

143
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.530
Doc. My boy.

144
00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.030
That's my sister.

145
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:35.830
Goddamn.

146
00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:40.040
Shoot, man. I'm speaking objectively

147
00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:40.040
here, you know what I'm saying?

148
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.170
All right, no, stop playing!

149
00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.250
May I take a message?

150
00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:47.760
Doc, is it all right

151
00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:47.760
if I have one of those first?

152
00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.220
You eat it at your own risk.

153
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:55.600
They're very old.

154
00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.730
So do you feel

155
00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.730
that you're making progress?

156
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:03.600
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

157
00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:06.440
I'm sleeping a lot better.

158
00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:09.280
And then also around the firing range

159
00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:09.280
and everything...

160
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.990
...when I first came back

161
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.990
and hear the pop, pop, pop...

162
00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:15.830
...I'd get jumpy and it would mess with

163
00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:15.830
me a bit and a little bit of a setback.

164
00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.080
But now it, you know...

165
00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.830
...doesn't bother me.

166
00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:22.790
So I think that's progress.

167
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:26.380
So, what's the story

168
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:26.380
with my status, doc?

169
00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:29.460
I mean, are you gonna clear me

170
00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:29.460
for combat? Because....

171
00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.550
Yeah, I feel good.

172
00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.510
Let's meet again next week...

173
00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:40.640
...and we'll discuss it. Okay?

174
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:45.980
All right, thank you.

175
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:45.980
Thank you very much, doc.

176
00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.950
Harris' girl is making the dude

177
00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.950
organise his entire wedding...

178
00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.580
...two weeks before we deploy.

179
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:03.500
I say the chick's busting his balls

180
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:03.500
like nobody's business.

181
00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:08.210
But he got two weeks to get it done

182
00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:08.210
because we're out.

183
00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:11.880
So I just came by to visit you

184
00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:11.880
one last time before we leave.

185
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:16.510
And I brought Dad's five iron with me.

186
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:16.510
And you know what that means.

187
00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:21.600
Me and the boys are gonna

188
00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:21.600
go out tonight, continue the tradition.

189
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.560
Have a good time, you know?

190
00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.230
I'll see you soon, bro.

191
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.280
See you soon.

192
00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:39.620
Motown, give me boots.

193
00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:39.620
I'm going skiing.

194
00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:41.370
Oh, that's how you do it, baby.

195
00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:45.580
Here they come.

196
00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:48.750
Don't mess this up, man.

197
00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:48.750
They cannot know that you a virgin.

198
00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.550
How do you know I--

199
00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.550
Who says I'm a virgin?

200
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:53.380
We know you are. Look at your face.

201
00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:55.970
What are you telling her?

202
00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:55.970
Telling her what?

203
00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:59.850
Oh, come on, you guys.

204
00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:59.850
You're killing me.

205
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.930
That dog gonna hunt! Damn, Daktari,

206
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.930
you can play, man.

207
00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.400
We have courses in Nigeria, Imlay.

208
00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:11.570
Shit. How am I supposed to know,

209
00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:11.570
man? It's an American game, right?

210
00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:14.110
Adukwu's our Navy corpsman.

211
00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:14.110
He's like a medic.

212
00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.530
No, not like a medic. Medic is

213
00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.530
the Army. I'm a Navy corpsman.

214
00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:19.660
Well, sailor, yes.

215
00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:21.370
I came here to become a doctor.

216
00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:27.790
Slow down.

217
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.500
That's like number five.

218
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:32.040
How many have you had?

219
00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:33.590
No, I'm good.

220
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.050
-Now, this guy here, Mr. Lenihan...

221
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.050
-Hey.

222
00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.010
...his mom signed

223
00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.010
so he could join up at 17.

224
00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.890
And I look after him because this boy

225
00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.890
don't know his ass from a hot rock.

226
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:52.520
-Not on my truck, dude!

227
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:52.520
-Easy, now. Easy, buddy.

228
00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:54.860
-Oh, yeah!

229
00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:54.860
-Not on my truck.

230
00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:58.110
-Toast. To Lenihan.

231
00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:58.110
-To Lenihan!

232
00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.910
Good luck, rookie.

233
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:01.320
Retreat, hell!

234
00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:04.740
--emergency developing throughout

235
00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:04.740
NASA and the space community.

236
00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:09.040
We now know that meteors will land

237
00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:09.040
off the coasts of eight different cities...

238
00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:11.130
...and that number could keep rising.

239
00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:14.210
Evacuations now under way

240
00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:14.210
in Southern California...

241
00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:16.710
...moving the population back

242
00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:16.710
from the coastline.

243
00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:20.050
But a lot of curious people

244
00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:20.050
are clamouring for views.

245
00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:25.600
-What are you doing up so early?

246
00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:25.600
-Lieutenant. Still gotta get used to that.

247
00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.980
This thing right?

248
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:33.230
-Here. You want me to do it?

249
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:33.230
-It's tricky.

250
00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:38.150
They gotta be parallel to the deck.

251
00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:38.150
That's the whole thing with these bars.

252
00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.610
-Don't forget to call Mr. Gilliam, okay?

253
00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.610
-Okay.

254
00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.530
-Call me later.

255
00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.530
-I'll call you later.

256
00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:49.120
That's my baby. All right.

257
00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:09.600
Let's go! Move!

258
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:17.270
Quick time! March!

259
00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:25.490
Marines! Into the trucks and report

260
00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:25.490
to your company! Let's go!

261
00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.030
Move it! Let's move!

262
00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.700
Move it!

263
00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:31.460
-Load them up!

264
00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:31.460
-Move it!

265
00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:33.790
What's going on, first sergeant?

266
00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.590
Meteors hitting off California now...

267
00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.880
...but they got the whole

268
00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.880
goddamn base being mobilised.

269
00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:45.510
I'm bringing you back to the company,

270
00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:45.510
Mike. They need you.

271
00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:47.720
First sergeant.

272
00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:52.140
All hands on deck, staff sergeant.

273
00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:58.900
-You heard we might be mobilising?

274
00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:58.900
-Yes, sir.

275
00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:00.530
Moving you up to squad leader.

276
00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:02.990
It's a big responsibility,

277
00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:02.990
but you can handle it.

278
00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.530
Thank you, sir.

279
00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:08.280
Staff Sergeant Beck is being replaced

280
00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:08.280
by Staff Sergeant Nantz.

281
00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:11.200
What do you know about him?

282
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:14.500
He's a very dedicated Marine.

283
00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:17.040
Don't bullshit me, corporal.

284
00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:19.880
What'd you hear about his last tour?

285
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:23.760
Just the grimy details

286
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:23.760
that everybody else already knows.

287
00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.720
But at the end of the day,

288
00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.720
you're our lieutenant...

289
00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:29.220
...and we take our orders from you, sir.

290
00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:36.650
You're assigned to 1st Platoon

291
00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:36.650
under Second Lieutenant Martinez.

292
00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:41.730
His platoon sergeant's on leave,

293
00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:41.730
so you're gonna have to suck it up.

294
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:45.570
Yeah, so, here's the lieutenant

295
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:45.570
right up here, 1 o'clock.

296
00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:47.160
He's a kid, Mike.

297
00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:49.580
Right out of officer training school.

298
00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:52.410
He's only been with us a month,

299
00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:52.410
but I think he's sharp.

300
00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:56.790
It's just an evacuation, buddy.

301
00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:56.790
He's in charge.

302
00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.540
Just keep an eye on him, huh?

303
00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.550
Just don't lose my paperwork.

304
00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:07.590
-Lieutenant.

305
00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:07.590
-Good afternoon, staff sergeant.

306
00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.600
-Happy to meet you.

307
00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.600
-Thank you, sir.

308
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:13.770
We're being called in to help with

309
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:13.770
an evacuation? For these meteors?

310
00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:15.430
I assume so.

311
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.350
Whatever it is, I'm happy to finally

312
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.350
get out in the field.

313
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.940
At approximately 4:42 am

314
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.940
Pacific Standard Time...

315
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:22.520
...the meteors impacted....

316
00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:25.490
Who the hell took my tortellini?

317
00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:25.490
You got tortellini?

318
00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:26.820
This some kind of drill?

319
00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:30.450
Get ready, man. Get ready.

320
00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:30.450
It's serious. Okay?

321
00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:38.040
Meteors continue to fall off the coast

322
00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:38.040
of California, Ireland, Bay of Bengal....

323
00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:39.290
Corporal. Corporal.

324
00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.040
-Corporal. Corporal.

325
00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.040
-Yeah?

326
00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:43.090
It's probably just a training exercise.

327
00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:46.470
No, man. They're shifting Nantz

328
00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:46.470
into our unit. Something's going on.

329
00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:49.760
The guy wants out of the Marine

330
00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:49.760
Corps and now we're stuck with him.

331
00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:51.720
-Stavs!

332
00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:51.720
-You got tortellini?

333
00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:54.770
I heard Nantz kicked ass his last tour.

334
00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:57.640
He went into that compound alone

335
00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:57.640
and killed 10 insurgents.

336
00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:00.560
-That's what you heard, Lenihan?

337
00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:00.560
-Chill out.

338
00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:03.270
Yeah. Johnson in Foxtrot told me

339
00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:03.270
that he was going on--

340
00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.730
Don't worry about it.

341
00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:07.650
-Let's go, this is serious.

342
00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:07.650
-What the hell did I do?

343
00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:09.990
Nantz got a couple guys killed

344
00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:09.990
on his last tour.

345
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.240
What?

346
00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:13.620
That's the story.

347
00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:13.620
Lockett's brother was one.

348
00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:18.120
So I know you didn't know, but

349
00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:18.120
just don't-- No, don't worry about it.

350
00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:20.830
Looks like we're getting into

351
00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:20.830
some heavy shit.

352
00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:24.750
It's been my experience, lieutenant,

353
00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:24.750
heavy shit is highly overrated.

354
00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:28.340
Look, staff sergeant, let's just be clear.

355
00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:30.680
I know your rep,

356
00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:30.680
know what you've done.

357
00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:33.300
This is my platoon.

358
00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:33.300
These are my men.

359
00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:36.770
-Not gonna have a problem, are we?

360
00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:36.770
-No problem, sir. She's all yours.

361
00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:40.190
It appears our initial assumptions

362
00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:40.190
were wrong.

363
00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:44.690
Listen up!

364
00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:44.690
Once you get your weapon...

365
00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:48.530
...get your gear, get your munitions,

366
00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:48.530
move outside!

367
00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:54.030
We got white chocolate rap from my

368
00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:54.030
man. That should finish the new mix?

369
00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.660
National Guard troops have flown in

370
00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.660
to evacuate beach areas...

371
00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:01.710
...and we have word

372
00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:01.710
the military is now deploying.

373
00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:04.880
That's us. That's us! That's us!

374
00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:08.460
-Calling military for a meteor shower?

375
00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:08.460
-I don't know why they're happy.

376
00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:10.300
--a meteor that just hit the ocean.

377
00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:15.510
Large plumes of smoke are coming

378
00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:15.510
up. Visibility is getting worse as we....

379
00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:17.930
These objects were

380
00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:17.930
completely undetected...

381
00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:19.890
...until they entered our atmosphere.

382
00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:23.480
NASA estimates that they are not

383
00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:23.480
hitting the water at terminal velocity.

384
00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:26.320
They're slowing down before impact.

385
00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:32.400
These objects are falling into

386
00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:32.400
the ocean in tightly packed clusters...

387
00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:35.450
...10 miles outside

388
00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:35.450
of a major population centre.

389
00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:37.660
Thermal imaging

390
00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:37.660
from the Hubble shows us...

391
00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:41.660
...that within each cluster is a central

392
00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:41.660
object much larger than the others.

393
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:45.000
Now, these central objects

394
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:45.000
are all the same geometric shape.

395
00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:47.540
They appear mechanical in nature.

396
00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.340
This is not a meteor shower, Marines.

397
00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:53.510
We are in Threatcon Delta.

398
00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:53.510
That's right.

399
00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:57.010
Come on. All units, gear up.

400
00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:58.760
Be ready to move.

401
00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.850
Combat situation.

402
00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:03.140
It's what I've been training for.

403
00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:09.270
I am told that one of the Coast Guard

404
00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:09.270
cutters has issued a mayday.

405
00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:11.940
It is difficult to see, and--

406
00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:11.940
Oh, my gosh!

407
00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:15.700
There is just another meteor

408
00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:15.700
that just hit the ocean...

409
00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:18.660
...and it's the closest one yet,

410
00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:18.660
right behind those cutters.

411
00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:21.200
Two or three meteors just impacted.

412
00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:23.370
Shit.

413
00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:26.920
Do you have any more information

414
00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:26.920
in the studio? Oh, my God.

415
00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:31.130
Kate? Kate? Are you hearing us?

416
00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:36.140
-Shut up, shut up, shut up!

417
00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:36.140
-Kate, are you still hearing us?

418
00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:40.850
Yes, Jean, I can hear you. Everyone,

419
00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:40.850
move out. Get out of the way.

420
00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:43.270
What is that?

421
00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:43.270
What is that in the water?

422
00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.560
I can't really get a good look,

423
00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.560
but it appears there's something--

424
00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:50.650
I'm looking through the people, trying

425
00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:50.650
to determine exactly what this is.

426
00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:54.700
I don't even know.

427
00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:54.700
It's like shadowy figures.

428
00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:58.740
Maybe five, six, seven.

429
00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:58.740
I can make out maybe eight figures.

430
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.200
-What the hell is that?

431
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.200
-Holy shit!

432
00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:05.250
-Look at that!

433
00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:05.250
-Stavs, you see that?

434
00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:09.130
I'm gonna head back now. Everyone

435
00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:09.130
needs to get out of here right now.

436
00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:19.140
I think that we've gotta leave, Jean.

437
00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:19.140
I'm gonna head back now.

438
00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:21.390
Oh, my God!

439
00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:27.440
Go! Let's go. Go, go!

440
00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:30.650
Corporal Grayston and Corporal Imlay

441
00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:30.650
are both expert marksmen...

442
00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:32.860
...as well as strong fire team leaders.

443
00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:35.940
We also have PFC Lenihan,

444
00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:35.940
who is our second best marksman...

445
00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:40.320
-...behind Lance Corporal Guerrero.

446
00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:40.320
-What's your take on this, Specs?

447
00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:42.990
I don't know. Extraterrestrial?

448
00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.290
-Do you mean like from space?

449
00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.290
-No, Imlay.

450
00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.790
-From Canada.

451
00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.790
-Always got jokes, don't you, Stav?

452
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.670
All right, first squad, line it up.

453
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.670
Bring it in. Let's go!

454
00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:53.880
As you may have heard...

455
00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:57.340
...Staff Sergeant Nantz will be

456
00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:57.340
taking over for Staff Sergeant Beck.

457
00:18:57.550 --> 00:18:59.550
We're lucky to have him aboard.

458
00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:03.890
All right. Here's the situation, Marines.

459
00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:03.890
We're facing an unknown enemy.

460
00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:07.940
We don't know how strong their

461
00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:07.940
force is or what they're capable of.

462
00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:11.730
But one thing we do know

463
00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:11.730
is that we're fighting for our land...

464
00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:15.400
...our families, our home

465
00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:15.400
and our country, goddamn it!

466
00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:18.950
Whatever those things are, let's show

467
00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:18.950
them how Marines fight. Retreat....

468
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:20.160
-Hell!

469
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:20.160
-Two-Five!

470
00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:22.320
-Retreat, hell!

471
00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:22.320
-Let's form it up, let's go!

472
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.340
First in, last out, Marines!

473
00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:40.090
Breathe, Lenihan. Breathe.

474
00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:40.090
Your training will kick in.

475
00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:42.220
Thank you, staff sergeant!

476
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:46.850
-Got something to get off your chest?

477
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:46.850
-No, it's cool, staff sergeant.

478
00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:50.100
You got a silver star, my brother

479
00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:50.100
came home in a box. I get it.

480
00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:56.070
All stations, this net.

481
00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:56.070
Standby for sitrep.

482
00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.570
Enemy elements have advanced

483
00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.570
beyond the beach.

484
00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:02.610
Aliens? That's not possible, right?

485
00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:05.410
We'll know soon enough, brother.

486
00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:10.160
One-oh-one tank has been destroyed.

487
00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:10.160
Company beyond the defensive line....

488
00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:14.330
It's in case his head gets blown off,

489
00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:14.330
so they can identify his body.

490
00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:18.710
Be advised, enemy have

491
00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:18.710
heavy assault weapons.

492
00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.590
Firepower equal

493
00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.590
to high-explosive rounds.

494
00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:28.390
Hey, staff sergeant! Promise me

495
00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:28.390
you won't let me be taken alive...

496
00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:32.140
...by some godless predator

497
00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:32.140
from another world, staff sergeant?

498
00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.900
No promises in combat.

499
00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:39.480
Stop screwing around

500
00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:39.480
and keep your head in it!

501
00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:45.660
These units are falling tactically.

502
00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:45.660
Their strategies are coordinated.

503
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:48.950
Do not underestimate enemy

504
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:48.950
combat intelligence.

505
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.090
We are not evacuating civilians

506
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.090
fast enough.

507
00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:00.670
I say again, we are not evacuating

508
00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:00.670
fast enough.

509
00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:06.220
All units be advised, there are

510
00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:06.220
friendlies behind enemy lines.

511
00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:09.260
Semper Fi, 1-7 Actual, out.

512
00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:45.050
You gotta take me to dinner first, baby.

513
00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:47.930
Boys, hold on to something.

514
00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:47.930
Things are about to get rough.

515
00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:33.890
Let's go, let's go, let's go! Out! Go!

516
00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:45.530
Move, move, move!

517
00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:49.110
Form it up!

518
00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:59.540
-What do we got, sir?

519
00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:59.540
-All right, situation is as follows:

520
00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:02.210
Most of Santa Monica's

521
00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:02.210
been cleared of civilians.

522
00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:06.010
We got a defensive line at Lincoln

523
00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:06.010
Boulevard a mile from the ocean.

524
00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:09.630
Air Force has got Warthogs

525
00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:09.630
and B-52s on deck.

526
00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:15.180
At 1930 hours, they will pound the

527
00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:15.180
entire area from Lincoln to the ocean.

528
00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:17.230
Shit.

529
00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.100
We're levelling Santa Monica, sir?

530
00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:23.570
We got an infestation

531
00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:23.570
of God knows what...

532
00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:26.740
...not of this Earth and

533
00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:26.740
we gotta hit them with everything...

534
00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:30.200
...and we gotta hit them hard.

535
00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:30.200
They are a ground-force enemy only.

536
00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:33.700
They have no aircraft, so the Air Force

537
00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:33.700
will tear them a new asshole...

538
00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:35.660
...and we will rule the air.

539
00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:37.910
-You said "most civilians," sir?

540
00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:37.910
-Affirmed.

541
00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:40.420
Getting distress calls,

542
00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:40.420
sending squads out.

543
00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:43.590
Golf, you take Santa Monica

544
00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:43.590
to Olympic.

545
00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:45.960
Foxtrot, Olympic to Pico.

546
00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:48.340
Echo, Pico to Ocean Park.

547
00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:51.090
Lieutenant Martinez,

548
00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:51.090
I want you to break off a squad...

549
00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:52.470
...and a machine gun team.

550
00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:56.600
Proceed west from Lincoln

551
00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:56.600
to a police station located here...

552
00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:58.980
-...at Venice and Amarosa.

553
00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:58.980
-Venice and Amarosa.

554
00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:00.560
Police were overrun.

555
00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:05.230
Got a distress call that civilians are

556
00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:05.230
still there. We don't know how many.

557
00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:07.480
Just gather survivors,

558
00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:07.480
then you radio in.

559
00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:10.570
We'll have helicopters

560
00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:10.570
in the area to evacuate you out.

561
00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:14.620
Now, be advised, you got exactly

562
00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:14.620
three hours before our bombs drop.

563
00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:17.910
And make no mistake, they will drop,

564
00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:17.910
with or without you.

565
00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:20.460
Get those civilians,

566
00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:20.460
get the hell out of there...

567
00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:23.960
...and you kill anything

568
00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:23.960
that is not human.

569
00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:26.290
Let's go! Let's get it done!

570
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:29.920
Captain, this is not a drill. You hold

571
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:29.920
that line, you understand me?

572
00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:31.170
Yes, sir.

573
00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:43.650
--from the coastline into suburbs.

574
00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:43.650
Golf company is overrun.

575
00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:46.190
Lima company

576
00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:46.190
requesting immediate air support.

577
00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.440
Civilians are being stranded

578
00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.440
behind enemy lines.

579
00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:50.990
Hang on, One!

580
00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:52.650
Fire in the hole!

581
00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:10.800
Troops are amassing in every coast,

582
00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:10.800
along every major coastline.

583
00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:12.920
The UN has called

584
00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:12.920
an emergency sitting...

585
00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:15.970
...in an attempt to establish

586
00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:15.970
a means for sharing resources...

587
00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:18.100
...and intelligence across the globe.

588
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:19.930
Watch out, go!

589
00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.730
This way?

590
00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.730
Where are we supposed to go?

591
00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:27.560
Jesus Christ.

592
00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:42.830
Marines, anything beyond this point,

593
00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:42.830
consider to be hostile.

594
00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:44.660
All right, nice and easy.

595
00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:56.090
Clear.

596
00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:00.970
Hell of a way to earn your citizenship.

597
00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:03.520
Shit. I'd rather be in Afghanistan.

598
00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:07.600
Lieutenant. How many civilians

599
00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:07.600
we gotta get out of that police station?

600
00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:10.820
I have no idea, Guerrero.

601
00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:10.820
Just stay focused.

602
00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:19.620
-What the hell's that? What is that?

603
00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:19.620
-This is insane.

604
00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:21.330
Yo, eyes open.

605
00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:24.370
An unidentified enemy

606
00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:24.370
has breached our coastlines...

607
00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:27.210
...in a swift and militaristic attack.

608
00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:30.460
At this point, there are many more

609
00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:30.460
questions than answers.

610
00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:35.010
Right now, one thing is clear:

611
00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:35.010
The world is at war.

612
00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:37.590
Eyes open.

613
00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:41.970
You see something, Simmons?

614
00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:44.430
Can't see shit.

615
00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:50.480
-Kerns, you see a cross street?

616
00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:50.480
-Lieutenant, I don't see nothing.

617
00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:54.110
Police station's

618
00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:54.110
about one klick northwest of here.

619
00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:29.440
-Twelve o'clock!

620
00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:29.440
-Hundred metres front.

621
00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:32.560
-This is Echo 6, we need immediate--

622
00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:32.560
-Turn your radios down.

623
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:45.330
-It's just a dog.

624
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:45.330
-Just a little doggy. Come here.

625
00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:46.660
-It's just a dog.

626
00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:46.660
-Dog.

627
00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:48.000
-Dog.

628
00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:50.290
What's his name, huh? "Glenn."

629
00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.790
Kidding me. Who's the idiot

630
00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.790
naming dogs these days?

631
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.880
What do you wanna call him, Fido?

632
00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:57.010
Watch out!

633
00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:06.010
-Where's it coming from?

634
00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:06.010
-I don't know.

635
00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:07.720
Lenihan, watch your head!

636
00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:09.100
On the roof!

637
00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:14.520
Enemy fire! Eleven o'clock!

638
00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:17.530
-They're on the roof! On the roof!

639
00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:17.530
-Cover him!

640
00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:24.870
Twenty-five metres!

641
00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:29.160
-Lieutenant!

642
00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:29.160
-Left flank, on the roof!

643
00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:31.290
Covering, covering!

644
00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.920
-We gotta move now!

645
00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.920
-Lockett!

646
00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:37.250
-Yes?

647
00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:37.250
-Get me an exit down that alley!

648
00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:40.260
Yes, sergeant!

649
00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:40.260
Kerns, Motown, let's go!

650
00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:45.430
Get up! Come on!

651
00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:47.010
Falling back!

652
00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:48.640
Let's go, come on!

653
00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:50.930
Enemy fire! Watch your head!

654
00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:53.350
-Where'd they come from?

655
00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:53.350
-Fall back!

656
00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:55.610
Enemy fire, keep your head down!

657
00:28:55.810 --> 00:28:57.150
It's all over the damn place!

658
00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:58.440
What do you see?

659
00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:00.360
I don't know, man. I don't see shit.

660
00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:01.990
How do we get out of here?

661
00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:04.490
-Lieutenant, where's the exit?

662
00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:04.490
-I'm working on it!

663
00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:07.700
-Shit, we're boxed in!

664
00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:07.700
-I'll take a position by the wall! Go, go!

665
00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:09.700
-Move out!

666
00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:09.700
-Ambush!

667
00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:13.330
I don't have him!

668
00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:14.830
I'm hit!

669
00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:17.540
Cover me, Lockett!

670
00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:31.310
-Man down, man down!

671
00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:31.310
-It burns!

672
00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:36.150
Shit!

673
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:38.480
I got you, Guerrero!

674
00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:47.570
Lieutenant! Lieutenant!

675
00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:54.250
I've got you covered!

676
00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:57.130
We have an exit!

677
00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:57.130
Everybody, move out! Move out!

678
00:29:57.330 --> 00:29:58.380
Move, move!

679
00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:02.630
Staff sergeant, we got an exit! Come

680
00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:02.630
on, we're going! Come on, let's go!

681
00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:06.550
Fall back, fall back!

682
00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.680
Fall back, fall back!

683
00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:21.940
Go, keep moving! Keep moving!

684
00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:26.240
Lorenzo!

685
00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:27.660
Move, move, move!

686
00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.120
Keep moving, keep moving,

687
00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.120
keep moving!

688
00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:33.330
I can't see shit!

689
00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:39.460
Shit, shit, shit!

690
00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:39.460
Imlay!

691
00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:41.670
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

692
00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:44.460
U.S. Marines, coming in!

693
00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:46.760
U.S. Marines, anybody in here?

694
00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:49.470
Kitchen's clear!

695
00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:49.470
The kitchen's clear, lieutenant!

696
00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:51.850
Get on that window! Are we clear?

697
00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:54.430
Put the wounded in the kitchen!

698
00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.810
Kerns, Lockett, secure the back

699
00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.810
of this house.

700
00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:59.440
-Yes, staff sergeant.

701
00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:59.440
-Staff sergeant, we're on it!

702
00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:04.610
Doc, how long

703
00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:04.610
till they're able to move?

704
00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:07.200
Ten minutes. Ten minutes,

705
00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:07.200
staff sergeant. Ten minutes.

706
00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:10.200
You want me?

707
00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:10.200
Come get some! I'm right here!

708
00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:11.870
What do we got, Imlay?

709
00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.290
I got nothing.

710
00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.290
I can't see a goddamn thing.

711
00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:16.830
-With this smoke, it's zero visibility.

712
00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:16.830
-You're dead!

713
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.290
Stow that shit, Simmons!

714
00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:20.920
You'll get shot before

715
00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:20.920
you're able to kill any of them.

716
00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:22.170
Your orders, sir?

717
00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.090
I led us right into that ambush.

718
00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:29.430
-Mottola, anyone on command?

719
00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:29.430
-No, sir.

720
00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:33.970
-We need to find answers to get out.

721
00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:33.970
-You're in charge, sir. Your orders?

722
00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:40.440
Let's radio that evac to meet us.

723
00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:42.810
Civilians or no,

724
00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:42.810
we gotta get these wounded out.

725
00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:45.360
-Roger that.

726
00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:45.360
-Hey, guys, guys. Where's Lenihan?

727
00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:47.650
I didn't see him with us. Where is he?

728
00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:48.900
-Lenihan?

729
00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:50.530
Anybody got eyes on Lenihan?

730
00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:52.870
-Lenihan!

731
00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:52.870
-I'll go for Lenihan, sir.

732
00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:56.160
Imlay, Harris, on me.

733
00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:56.160
Let's get this shit out of here.

734
00:31:56.370 --> 00:31:58.660
I'll package the wounded.

735
00:31:56.370 --> 00:31:58.660
Rally on 10th Street.

736
00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:01.210
Be prepared to move.

737
00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:01.210
We're moving out soon.

738
00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:04.000
Shit.

739
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:14.010
Mottorola.

740
00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.260
Mottorola?

741
00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:20.890
Oh, come on. Mottorola, you copy?

742
00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:22.350
Lenihan, where are you?

743
00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:23.980
Staff sergeant?

744
00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:27.900
Jesus Christ. I had to turn my radio

745
00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:27.900
off. These things are everywhere.

746
00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:30.190
We're coming for you.

747
00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:30.190
What's your location?

748
00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:33.660
I'm in the laundry room

749
00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:33.660
of some apartment complex.

750
00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:35.620
It's like three storeys--

751
00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:49.210
What colour is it? Lenihan. Lenihan?

752
00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:07.070
Shit.

753
00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:14.360
Lenihan.

754
00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:16.820
Lenihan.

755
00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:22.830
Shit.

756
00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:34.130
So smooth....

757
00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.430
Smooth is fast.

758
00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:39.470
Shit.

759
00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:48.150
Oh, shit.

760
00:34:39.410 --> 00:34:41.160
-Lenihan!

761
00:34:39.410 --> 00:34:41.160
-Lenihan, lower that weapon!

762
00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.870
What the hell--?

763
00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:55.880
Keep on firing!

764
00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:00.300
Jesus Christ!

765
00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:00.300
What the hell is that thing?

766
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:03.930
It's not dead. They don't die. I've hit it

767
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:03.930
a hundred times. They don't die.

768
00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:07.350
Get separated from the unit again,

769
00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:07.350
I'll find you and shoot you myself.

770
00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:10.150
Imlay, drop a grenade in that pool.

771
00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:10.150
Let's move!

772
00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:12.360
Come on, I got you. I got you.

773
00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:14.900
Frag out.

774
00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:28.750
Street's clear.

775
00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:31.670
Get down, get down, get down.

776
00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:35.710
-What's happening? What's going on?

777
00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:35.710
-All right, we're good. Come on.

778
00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:43.100
-It's Lenihan.

779
00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:43.100
-Yo, Lockett.

780
00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:47.560
You owe me $5. I told you, a virgin

781
00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:47.560
ain't gonna die till he get him some.

782
00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:49.440
Move to the police station?

783
00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:52.900
-All right, let's move. Let's move.

784
00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:52.900
-Move it. Move it out.

785
00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:08.250
-Where'd that come from?

786
00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:08.250
-Door's open at the bank!

787
00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:09.750
Take care of him.

788
00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:11.250
Where'd the shot come from?

789
00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:14.250
-Kerns!

790
00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:14.250
-Door's open on the bank! Let's move!

791
00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:17.130
Come on, let's go! Move! Move it!

792
00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:21.630
Stavrou, you got front. Stavrou,

793
00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:21.630
cover front. Harris, cover front!

794
00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:24.260
Roof's clear, roof's clear!

795
00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:25.680
I got it. I got it covered.

796
00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:28.390
Harris! Find me where

797
00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:28.390
that shot came from, guys!

798
00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:30.690
Imlay, get eyes up on that roof,

799
00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:30.690
all right?

800
00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:33.190
-Cover the roof!

801
00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:33.190
-Roof's clear, roof's clear!

802
00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:34.610
Lockett, on me!

803
00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:36.900
Did anybody even see

804
00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:36.900
where that came from?

805
00:36:38.570 --> 00:36:39.610
Doc, how serious?

806
00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:42.610
Third degree thermal burns

807
00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:42.610
on his neck and his face, sir.

808
00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:45.620
You'll be surfing soon, Simmons.

809
00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:47.370
Shit.

810
00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:53.500
-Hostiles, 12 o'clock!

811
00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:53.500
-Hostiles at 12 o'clock!

812
00:36:53.710 --> 00:36:55.790
Staff sergeant, hostiles, 12 o'clock!

813
00:36:57.130 --> 00:36:58.170
Prepare to fire!

814
00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:00.630
Hold it, hold it!

815
00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:02.380
Friendlies, sir.

816
00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:07.220
-Shit.

817
00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:07.220
-Friendlies. Let's get them in.

818
00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:11.430
Get over here.

819
00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:18.230
Move. Move to the back.

820
00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:18.230
Let's go. Come on, get.

821
00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:22.240
-What's your unit?

822
00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:22.240
-40th, ID.

823
00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:24.070
Where's the rest of your unit?

824
00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:26.660
Everyone else is either dead

825
00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:26.660
or missing.

826
00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:29.450
I picked up Air Force here.

827
00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:31.830
Tech Sergeant Elena Santos,

828
00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:31.830
Air Force.

829
00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:36.210
61st Wing, intel, surveillance,

830
00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:36.210
recon division.

831
00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:38.590
Tech sergeant? What the hell

832
00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:38.590
are you doing here?

833
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.380
We were tracking enemy transmissions

834
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.380
about 12 klicks south of here.

835
00:37:42.590 --> 00:37:45.010
They ambushed us

836
00:37:42.590 --> 00:37:45.010
like they knew our freaking address.

837
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:47.470
I'm the only one left.

838
00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:51.560
I found these guys on the way to the

839
00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:51.560
safe zone at Santa Monica Airport.

840
00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:54.440
You ready to use that weapon,

841
00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:54.440
tech sergeant?

842
00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:58.810
With all due respect, staff sergeant,

843
00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:58.810
I didn't get this far off of my good looks.

844
00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:00.900
-I'm ready for payback.

845
00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:00.900
-Outstanding.

846
00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:05.150
Lieutenant, bird inbound,

847
00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:05.150
25 minutes, sir.

848
00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:08.370
Roger that.

849
00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:08.370
Let's get to that police station.

850
00:38:08.570 --> 00:38:11.160
All right, let's get Simmons and move.

851
00:38:08.570 --> 00:38:11.160
Let's go!

852
00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:18.750
Cover our flanks, Mottorola!

853
00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:18.750
To the right, in that building!

854
00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:20.040
Watch your feet!

855
00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:21.550
There's the police station.

856
00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:24.550
Let's get those civilians

857
00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:24.550
and get back to the F.O.B.!

858
00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:28.930
Gotta rock, gotta rock!

859
00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:36.020
Come on, come on, come on.

860
00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:39.020
I'll stay with our wounded,

861
00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:39.020
wait for the medevac.

862
00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:41.860
I'll go for civilians.

863
00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:41.860
Kerns, Dever, on me.

864
00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:45.070
-Mags, mags. I need mags.

865
00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:45.070
-All right.

866
00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:49.030
Santos, when that bird arrives,

867
00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:49.030
I'll need your help on this stretcher.

868
00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:51.660
U.S. Marines! U.S. Marines!

869
00:38:53.370 --> 00:38:54.830
Door. The door.

870
00:38:55.450 --> 00:38:56.790
-Elevator right.

871
00:38:55.450 --> 00:38:56.790
-Clear!

872
00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.500
Elevator right.

873
00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:01.750
Second elevator, clear! No pulse.

874
00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:04.710
Door left.

875
00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:06.470
It's locked.

876
00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:07.970
-What's your name?

877
00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:07.970
-Harper.

878
00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:11.010
-I'm gonna need you on this stretcher.

879
00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:11.010
-Bird incoming, sir!

880
00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:13.970
Roger that. Imlay, pop smoke!

881
00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:20.230
-Door locked.

882
00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:20.230
-Door left.

883
00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:24.530
Radios off.

884
00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:36.370
Move.

885
00:40:04.610 --> 00:40:06.940
U.S. Marines! U.S. Marines!

886
00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:10.910
-How many of you?

887
00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:10.910
-Five of us, three kids.

888
00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:12.660
Kerns, kids!

889
00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:16.700
-Let's move!

890
00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:16.700
-Let's go, let's go!

891
00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:19.830
All right, let's get ready to move!

892
00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:19.830
Let's get it up!

893
00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:24.170
-Here we go! Let's move!

894
00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:24.170
-Aye, sir!

895
00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:27.170
We got room for four and that is it!

896
00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:27.170
That is it.

897
00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:29.720
-Get your wounded on! Move it!

898
00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:29.720
-Oh, yeah, baby.

899
00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:32.090
Come on. Come on. Get up. Get up.

900
00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:33.970
Get him in. Hey, Guerrero.

901
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:37.470
I'll work on that mix for you!

902
00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:41.100
I'm gonna need it, dude! You're

903
00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:41.100
gonna be fine! You're gonna be fine!

904
00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:42.850
Give them hell!

905
00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:46.610
-Oh, shit.

906
00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:46.610
-Come on, man.

907
00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:50.030
You just had to get out of the shit.

908
00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:52.030
-You take care of yourself!

909
00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:52.030
-I will.

910
00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:54.070
I'll see you soon, partner.

911
00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:57.030
-That's it.

912
00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:57.030
-We have civilians coming out!

913
00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:59.540
-We can't take them, we got no room!

914
00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:59.540
-Make room!

915
00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:01.710
We can't! Now, get back, sir!

916
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:05.040
Fall back.

917
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:05.040
Move back, move back, move back!

918
00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:11.920
Wait! Kids, kids!

919
00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:28.570
Get back to the police station!

920
00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:36.030
Backtrack, everybody! Come on, back!

921
00:41:44.830 --> 00:41:48.840
They have air power. Again, enemy

922
00:41:44.830 --> 00:41:48.840
has air support. We have a bird down.

923
00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:50.340
Damn it!

924
00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:52.340
Tango's heading northeast of our grid.

925
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:55.470
We've disengaged back into a

926
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:55.470
police station. We have civilians.

927
00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.930
I say again, we have civilians.

928
00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:01.470
Lockett, Kerns, secure this door.

929
00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:01.470
Nothing gets in, you understand?

930
00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:08.610
We got a body. Do you think you could

931
00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:08.610
get rid of it so the kids don't see it?

932
00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:10.570
What do you want?

933
00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:10.570
Where should we go?

934
00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:11.820
Dever.

935
00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:13.740
Set up back there, okay?

936
00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:18.740
Come on, you guys. Take the back.

937
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:20.990
Stay away from the window, all right?

938
00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:24.500
Are there gonna be more choppers?

939
00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:24.500
Did you guys call any in?

940
00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:29.880
I'm sure they're gonna come for us.

941
00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:29.880
They know where we are.

942
00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:34.760
Shit.

943
00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:34.760
You okay? You all right?

944
00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:36.380
-I'm good. Yeah.

945
00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:36.380
-You sure?

946
00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:40.140
-You didn't get hit or nothing?

947
00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:40.140
-No, I'm good, man. I'm good.

948
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:43.970
Man, they're gone. They're gone.

949
00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:46.640
Everybody's gone.

950
00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:46.640
Lenihan, Guerrero, Grayston.

951
00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:48.900
Grayston. Grayston had kids.

952
00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:50.940
Didn't deserve that.

953
00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:50.940
Didn't deserve that!

954
00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:52.860
He didn't deserve to go out like that!

955
00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:56.990
Neither do you! You hear me?

956
00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:56.990
You're gonna make it through this!

957
00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:01.580
All right? You're gonna get out of here.

958
00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:01.580
You're gonna marry Cherise.

959
00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:03.620
And you're gonna be her problem...

960
00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:07.330
...because I'm done taking care

961
00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:07.330
of your sorry ass, you got that?

962
00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:13.050
All stations, this net. Sitrep as follow:

963
00:43:13.210 --> 00:43:16.260
Enemy aircraft

964
00:43:13.210 --> 00:43:16.260
number four fleets at this time.

965
00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:19.800
Be advised, more entering battle

966
00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:19.800
space Los Angeles from ocean...

967
00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:22.350
...on bearing 2-niner-7-5-0.

968
00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:24.810
They got air support too.

969
00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:28.390
Knocked our bird right out of the sky.

970
00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:31.440
So much for ruling the air.

971
00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:35.190
There's no time for that, lieutenant.

972
00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:37.240
Those bombs are gonna drop.

973
00:43:38.110 --> 00:43:40.240
And we're in the blast radius.

974
00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:43.910
Top of my goddamn class.

975
00:43:44.370 --> 00:43:48.660
And I get out in combat in the middle

976
00:43:44.370 --> 00:43:48.660
of that shit? Goddamn it!

977
00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:51.420
I already lost four

978
00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:51.420
of my goddamn men!

979
00:43:52.170 --> 00:43:53.290
Four good men.

980
00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:55.630
Who would go to hell and back

981
00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:55.630
for you, sir.

982
00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:02.050
-Have you?

983
00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:02.050
-Yes.

984
00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:05.220
You're not the first to lose men.

985
00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:05.220
You won't be the last.

986
00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:07.770
Now, put that away.

987
00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:07.770
You understand me?

988
00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:10.520
Right now your men are

989
00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:10.520
awaiting orders.

990
00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:14.770
Now, you can go left, you can go right.

991
00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:14.770
I don't give a damn.

992
00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:17.360
Just make a decision.

993
00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:20.570
Lieutenant.

994
00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:23.490
It's a no-go on the helo, sir.

995
00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:25.580
Enemy aircraft is lighting it up.

996
00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:28.080
Command says it's like nothing

997
00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:28.080
they ever seen.

998
00:44:28.290 --> 00:44:30.040
We gotta find a way out.

999
00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:32.460
We gotta get to that F.O.B.

1000
00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:35.540
You're right. We gotta move.

1001
00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:38.840
Let's get these people safe.

1002
00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:38.840
Lockett, Kerns!

1003
00:44:39.050 --> 00:44:41.630
I need you to set up

1004
00:44:39.050 --> 00:44:41.630
an observation post on the roof.

1005
00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:44.180
We're gonna move by foot,

1006
00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:44.180
so we gotta move fast.

1007
00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:47.010
Scan for hostiles,

1008
00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:47.010
find the best route out of here.

1009
00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:48.680
All right, sir.

1010
00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:51.230
Lieutenant.

1011
00:44:56.440 --> 00:45:00.570
Officials are now saying any civilian

1012
00:44:56.440 --> 00:45:00.570
within 10 miles of the coast...

1013
00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:02.360
...should try to make their way...

1014
00:45:02.530 --> 00:45:04.450
...to a military

1015
00:45:02.530 --> 00:45:04.450
forward operating base, F.O.B.

1016
00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:08.620
This is the safest place

1017
00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:08.620
that you could be right now.

1018
00:45:08.830 --> 00:45:12.750
Now, the military has set up a line

1019
00:45:08.830 --> 00:45:12.750
of defence to try to protect civilians.

1020
00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:17.040
Take a look at you, make sure

1021
00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:17.040
you're okay, all right? Good. Okay.

1022
00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:20.880
Just look at this. There you go.

1023
00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:24.050
-Water fountain is there, Mr. Rincon.

1024
00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:24.050
-Okay, thank you.

1025
00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:25.550
-No problem.

1026
00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:25.550
-Thank you.

1027
00:45:28.810 --> 00:45:31.390
-Joe Rincon.

1028
00:45:28.810 --> 00:45:31.390
-Staff Sergeant Nantz.

1029
00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:32.770
This is my son, Hector.

1030
00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:36.650
We all wanted to thank you

1031
00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:36.650
for coming to get us.

1032
00:45:37.610 --> 00:45:38.820
Yeah.

1033
00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:41.780
Hey, Hector. We leave no man behind.

1034
00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:44.990
So you here

1035
00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:44.990
when the police got overrun?

1036
00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:51.160
Right. Well, long as you're both okay.

1037
00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:54.460
Hey, you all right, man?

1038
00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:56.830
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

1039
00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:58.420
Okay.

1040
00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:02.170
If you-- If you need him

1041
00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:02.170
to do anything...

1042
00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:05.630
-...you know.

1043
00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:05.630
-I'll let you know.

1044
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:09.930
Aye-aye, sir.

1045
00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:11.720
Aye.

1046
00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:14.100
Thank you.

1047
00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:21.190
We got two dozen hostiles

1048
00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:21.190
about 300 metres out.

1049
00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:24.990
Lieutenant, we got two dozen hostiles

1050
00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:24.990
300 metres north, over.

1051
00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:29.910
It's like those things are on overwatch,

1052
00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:29.910
just like us.

1053
00:46:31.490 --> 00:46:34.540
That one out front looks like

1054
00:46:31.490 --> 00:46:34.540
the leader. Now they got leadership.

1055
00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:36.580
So do ants, Kerns.

1056
00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:39.500
You think those things get scared too?

1057
00:46:40.590 --> 00:46:44.760
Probably just like us. They're probably

1058
00:46:40.590 --> 00:46:44.760
just grunts that get told to go fight.

1059
00:46:44.970 --> 00:46:50.010
Come on. Find us a way out of here,

1060
00:46:44.970 --> 00:46:50.010
Marine, because we're sitting ducks.

1061
00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:52.760
They dragged them out of the house,

1062
00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:52.760
into the street...

1063
00:46:52.930 --> 00:46:55.270
...put them in perfect order

1064
00:46:52.930 --> 00:46:55.270
before they shot them.

1065
00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:57.020
They shot them right in the head.

1066
00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:59.650
Chief, do we have any idea

1067
00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:59.650
why this is happening?

1068
00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:03.230
Well, it's clear there has been no

1069
00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:03.230
attempt at any kind of communication.

1070
00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:05.610
No demands, nothing like that.

1071
00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:08.410
So, obviously,

1072
00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:08.410
they are here for our resources.

1073
00:47:10.370 --> 00:47:12.120
When you invade a place

1074
00:47:10.370 --> 00:47:12.120
for resources...

1075
00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:14.200
...you wipe out

1076
00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:14.200
the indigenous population.

1077
00:47:14.370 --> 00:47:16.410
Those are the rules

1078
00:47:14.370 --> 00:47:16.410
of any colonisation.

1079
00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:20.210
And, right now,

1080
00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:20.210
we are being colonised.

1081
00:47:20.830 --> 00:47:22.420
Brave kids.

1082
00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:26.800
They're my nieces. My sister and her

1083
00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:26.800
husband are away on vacation.

1084
00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:34.100
Thing is, they live in Arizona.

1085
00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:34.100
I see them once or twice a year.

1086
00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:37.310
And now I may be all they have left.

1087
00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:40.650
-You have kids?

1088
00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:40.650
-No.

1089
00:47:40.850 --> 00:47:42.730
Neither do I.

1090
00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:47.280
I used to regret that,

1091
00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:47.280
but maybe it was for the best.

1092
00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:50.110
Of course, our planet's surface

1093
00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:50.110
is 70 percent water.

1094
00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:52.950
So again, and I have to stress this,

1095
00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:52.950
without certainty...

1096
00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:56.540
...the leading hypothesis remains

1097
00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:56.540
that their objective, their target...

1098
00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:57.790
...is our water.

1099
00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:01.750
-Shit.

1100
00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:01.750
-There ain't gonna be nothing left.

1101
00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:05.300
-I think I got a way out of here.

1102
00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:05.300
-What'd you say?

1103
00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:07.380
Right here, look. 200 metres out.

1104
00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:09.720
-What's right behind that backside?

1105
00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:09.720
-Bus.

1106
00:48:10.130 --> 00:48:12.680
-Lieutenant, we got a bus.

1107
00:48:10.130 --> 00:48:12.680
-Roger that.

1108
00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:16.180
So the men on the roof saw a bus.

1109
00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:16.180
They think it could be operational.

1110
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:19.180
Maybe we'd be better off on foot.

1111
00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:22.350
It's miles to the operating base...

1112
00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:24.900
...and those bombs

1113
00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:24.900
are gonna drop in an hour.

1114
00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:26.150
We gotta move fast.

1115
00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:28.990
Bus is a big target.

1116
00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:30.400
I made the call.

1117
00:48:31.410 --> 00:48:33.320
It's my responsibility.

1118
00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:35.200
Stavrou, Harris.

1119
00:48:35.410 --> 00:48:38.370
Lieutenant needs recon on a bus.

1120
00:48:35.410 --> 00:48:38.370
If it runs, get it back here.

1121
00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:42.540
-You know how to hotwire a bus?

1122
00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:42.540
-Stavrou can. He's from Jersey, sir.

1123
00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:44.130
Ladies first.

1124
00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:49.130
Two hundred metres.

1125
00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:52.180
Go down, there's the cars burnt out,

1126
00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:52.180
there's a pickup truck.

1127
00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:53.840
Right back behind there.

1128
00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:58.680
We have a situation.

1129
00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:58.680
Y'all need to follow me.

1130
00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:03.690
Harris found it out here.

1131
00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:03.690
Y'all gotta see this thing.

1132
00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:16.030
Weapon looks like it's been

1133
00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:16.030
surgically attached.

1134
00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:18.370
Talk about commitment to cause.

1135
00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:26.380
Shit.

1136
00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:31.210
-You gotta be kidding!

1137
00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:31.210
-Corporal. Corporal, hold it.

1138
00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:34.930
Let me shoot this thing, staff sergeant.

1139
00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:34.930
That weapon's hot.

1140
00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:36.220
Let me just shoot it.

1141
00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:37.600
-Doc.

1142
00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:37.600
-Yes, staff sergeant.

1143
00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:39.930
Oh, Lord, have mercy.

1144
00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:43.770
We need to know exactly

1145
00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:43.770
where to hit this thing...

1146
00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:45.730
...so we don't waste all our ammo.

1147
00:49:47.690 --> 00:49:49.270
Maybe I can help.

1148
00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:50.980
I'm a veterinarian.

1149
00:50:03.830 --> 00:50:05.460
Sure you wanna do this?

1150
00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:08.420
I was more sure when

1151
00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:08.420
I was standing over there.

1152
00:50:09.250 --> 00:50:11.300
We gotta figure out

1153
00:50:09.250 --> 00:50:11.300
how to kill these things.

1154
00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:14.720
Otherwise, we won't last another

1155
00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:14.720
five minutes out there, okay?

1156
00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:18.220
Let's peel this back.

1157
00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:24.940
-Look at this, we got a organ here.

1158
00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:24.940
-Jesus Christ, look at that.

1159
00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:27.100
-I got another one.

1160
00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:27.100
-Me too.

1161
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:30.320
Does it have some sort of

1162
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:30.320
cognitive mechanism? Anything?

1163
00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:33.490
There's no frontal lobe,

1164
00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:33.490
no temporal lobe, no parietal lobe.

1165
00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:35.450
The cranial vault is unlike anything.

1166
00:50:35.650 --> 00:50:37.110
-Oh, shit.

1167
00:50:35.650 --> 00:50:37.110
-What?

1168
00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:38.870
-You see what I'm seeing?

1169
00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:38.870
-What?

1170
00:50:39.070 --> 00:50:41.330
The ones that were just

1171
00:50:39.070 --> 00:50:41.330
on the roof aren't on it.

1172
00:50:41.490 --> 00:50:43.540
There's about two dozen

1173
00:50:41.490 --> 00:50:43.540
coming out the door.

1174
00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:45.620
They're on the street heading this way.

1175
00:50:45.790 --> 00:50:48.290
-Lieutenant, we got movement up here.

1176
00:50:45.790 --> 00:50:48.290
-Roger that.

1177
00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:51.040
We have contact 300 metres out.

1178
00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:51.040
We gotta cut quick.

1179
00:50:58.590 --> 00:51:00.470
Lieutenant, we gotta move!

1180
00:50:58.590 --> 00:51:00.470
What do we do?

1181
00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:03.140
-Shit's hitting the fan. Gotta move.

1182
00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:03.140
-Staff sergeant.

1183
00:51:03.350 --> 00:51:05.560
Come on, how do you kill this thing?

1184
00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:15.900
Goddamn it, Stavs.

1185
00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:18.320
-I lost them.

1186
00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:18.320
-You lost them?

1187
00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:22.160
Lieutenant, they're gone.

1188
00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:22.160
Lieutenant, I don't see anything.

1189
00:51:23.370 --> 00:51:26.200
-We got a breach.

1190
00:51:23.370 --> 00:51:26.200
-Got a breach on the north entrance!

1191
00:51:26.410 --> 00:51:27.500
They're inside.

1192
00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:30.080
I'm gonna gather everyone

1193
00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:30.080
by the doors on the south side.

1194
00:51:30.250 --> 00:51:31.840
We're right behind you.

1195
00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:33.550
What was that?

1196
00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:36.170
-Adukwu, you go with her.

1197
00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:36.170
-Yes, staff sergeant.

1198
00:51:36.510 --> 00:51:39.550
-Imlay, got an HE grenade round?

1199
00:51:36.510 --> 00:51:39.550
-Never leave home without it.

1200
00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:42.140
You cover that hall to the rear.

1201
00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:42.140
Buy me some time.

1202
00:51:42.350 --> 00:51:45.060
They start coming,

1203
00:51:42.350 --> 00:51:45.060
you blast the hell out of them.

1204
00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:47.680
Hey, Harris.

1205
00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:47.680
Where's that goddamn bus?

1206
00:51:47.890 --> 00:51:50.770
Stavs. Stavs, we got an enemy scout.

1207
00:51:47.890 --> 00:51:50.770
Come on, let's go.

1208
00:51:52.610 --> 00:51:56.570
Yes! Yes! Yeah, baby!

1209
00:51:52.610 --> 00:51:56.570
Newark! Represent!

1210
00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:58.990
Lieutenant, we've got the bus,

1211
00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:58.990
heading back.

1212
00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:01.490
Okay, guys, the bus is en route!

1213
00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:01.490
Bus is en route!

1214
00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:03.660
Thirty seconds till we move out!

1215
00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:12.710
Imlay, give me a sitrep.

1216
00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:12.710
I need an update on the breach.

1217
00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:14.790
Report back, over.

1218
00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:22.050
We're running out of time.

1219
00:52:32.190 --> 00:52:33.440
Move!

1220
00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:39.150
Contact!

1221
00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:41.700
They've breached.

1222
00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:48.200
This is our last shot.

1223
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.540
Got it.

1224
00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:52.710
Right here.

1225
00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:02.300
That's gotta be it. It's dying.

1226
00:53:06.930 --> 00:53:10.270
That's how we kill this thing, to

1227
00:53:06.930 --> 00:53:10.270
the right of where the heart would be.

1228
00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:11.810
-Got it.

1229
00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:11.810
-I got three more!

1230
00:53:16.310 --> 00:53:17.940
Let's get out of here.

1231
00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:24.950
Get them on the bus! Get them

1232
00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:24.950
on that bus! Let's go, let's go!

1233
00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:32.500
-Get on.

1234
00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:32.500
-Get underneath.

1235
00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:34.710
You okay?

1236
00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:42.670
Heads up. Cover your sectors of fire.

1237
00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:42.670
Heads up!

1238
00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:50.520
Marines, concentrate firepower to

1239
00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:50.520
the right of where the heart would be.

1240
00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:52.100
Yes, staff sergeant.

1241
00:53:53.020 --> 00:53:54.520
That's how we kill these things.

1242
00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:58.110
All right, remember your training.

1243
00:53:58.270 --> 00:54:00.360
We got a hostile warbird,

1244
00:53:58.270 --> 00:54:00.360
thousand metres out.

1245
00:54:00.530 --> 00:54:01.860
Everybody keep your eyes up.

1246
00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:12.160
All buckled up back there, lieutenant.

1247
00:54:12.370 --> 00:54:13.790
Roger that.

1248
00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:17.130
It should be about

1249
00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:17.130
six miles to the F.O.B.

1250
00:54:17.330 --> 00:54:19.210
I don't know, 25, 30 minutes.

1251
00:54:19.590 --> 00:54:21.420
If we stay on these side streets.

1252
00:54:21.630 --> 00:54:24.380
Air Force is gonna level this area

1253
00:54:21.630 --> 00:54:24.380
in 40 minutes.

1254
00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:33.980
Get us to the forward operating base.

1255
00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:33.980
Fast.

1256
00:54:48.490 --> 00:54:50.280
What the hell is that?

1257
00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:52.370
Stavrou, stop the bus.

1258
00:55:08.510 --> 00:55:09.640
Everyone, get down.

1259
00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:28.320
Any station, this is

1260
00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:28.320
Foxtrot-Two-November. Sitrep to follow.

1261
00:55:28.530 --> 00:55:30.570
Go ahead, Foxtrot-Two-November.

1262
00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:33.030
Enemy aircraft.

1263
00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:33.030
They're lighting up the sky...

1264
00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:35.870
...heading east towards

1265
00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:35.870
downtown Los Angeles.

1266
00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:37.210
Copy that.

1267
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:41.330
They're tracking our signals.

1268
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.720
Mottola, turn off that radio!

1269
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.720
They're tracking our signals!

1270
00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:50.180
All radios off! Cell phones, everything!

1271
00:55:52.050 --> 00:55:53.720
Give me your radio.

1272
00:55:57.430 --> 00:55:59.440
Mottola. Give me your radio.

1273
00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:03.980
Where you going?

1274
00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:06.320
-Staff sergeant!

1275
00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:06.320
-Where the hell is he going?

1276
00:56:14.910 --> 00:56:19.620
-We gotta get off this bus, all right?

1277
00:56:14.910 --> 00:56:19.620
-Ten o'clock, lieutenant, 10 o'clock!

1278
00:56:19.830 --> 00:56:22.960
I see it, 8 o'clock, heading south!

1279
00:56:23.170 --> 00:56:26.300
It's getting closer. Hey, it's on my six!

1280
00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:35.180
A hundred metres!

1281
00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:43.770
Oh, my God.

1282
00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:48.320
Everybody, get down!

1283
00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:04.040
Holy shit.

1284
00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:45.420
-What was that?

1285
00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:45.420
-Is he all right?

1286
00:57:45.630 --> 00:57:48.090
-Did he make it out?

1287
00:57:45.630 --> 00:57:48.090
-Staff sergeant?

1288
00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:07.310
-There he is.

1289
00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:07.310
-Staff sergeant's alive!

1290
00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:09.650
-Yeah, he's alive!

1291
00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:09.650
-There he is!

1292
00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:46.440
That aircraft was unmanned,

1293
00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:46.440
lieutenant.

1294
00:58:47.230 --> 00:58:48.770
Drone.

1295
00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:59.120
That was some real John Wayne shit,

1296
00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:59.120
staff sergeant.

1297
00:59:07.290 --> 00:59:08.750
Hey.

1298
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.960
I can't afford to lose you.

1299
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.960
Neither can these men, all right?

1300
00:59:14.670 --> 00:59:16.510
Yeah. They're your men.

1301
00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:20.970
All right, staff sergeant!

1302
00:59:24.310 --> 00:59:25.890
That's how you do it!

1303
00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:28.270
-That's retreat, hell!

1304
00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:28.270
-That's right.

1305
00:59:28.690 --> 00:59:31.150
Who the hell's John Wayne?

1306
00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:43.450
Everybody, eyes open!

1307
00:59:43.660 --> 00:59:45.330
Stay alert!

1308
00:59:46.330 --> 00:59:48.210
Thank you for that.

1309
00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:54.170
It's nothing.

1310
00:59:55.510 --> 00:59:57.380
What's that mean, "retreat, hell"?

1311
01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:05.970
During World War I, an officer from

1312
01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:05.970
our regiment was ordered to retreat.

1313
01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:10.900
He said, "Retreat, hell.

1314
01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:10.900
We just got here."

1315
01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:17.400
You should have the doc

1316
01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:17.400
take a look at that.

1317
01:00:18.150 --> 01:00:19.650
I thought you were a doctor.

1318
01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:22.820
Animals and aliens only.

1319
01:00:23.490 --> 01:00:25.660
I'll put it on my to-do list.

1320
01:00:26.370 --> 01:00:27.660
Thank you.

1321
01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:40.970
Excuse me, staff sergeant. Did you

1322
01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:40.970
say that was an unmanned drone?

1323
01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:42.550
Correct.

1324
01:00:43.590 --> 01:00:46.470
They must have one hell of

1325
01:00:43.590 --> 01:00:46.470
a command-and-control system.

1326
01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:49.730
If NORTHCOM didn't agree with you,

1327
01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:49.730
I wouldn't be here.

1328
01:00:49.930 --> 01:00:51.350
Why?

1329
01:00:52.690 --> 01:00:56.610
My mission was to provide AIS

1330
01:00:52.690 --> 01:00:56.610
with a strike package.

1331
01:00:56.940 --> 01:00:58.360
A strike package?

1332
01:00:58.570 --> 01:01:02.280
Yeah, coordinates for a missile strike

1333
01:00:58.570 --> 01:01:02.280
on a command-and-control centre.

1334
01:01:02.490 --> 01:01:06.410
But the asset fell off

1335
01:01:02.490 --> 01:01:06.410
the grid and we lost them.

1336
01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:19.800
All side streets are blocked.

1337
01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:19.800
Our only choice is to take the freeway.

1338
01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:23.220
All right. Well, it's your call.

1339
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:25.140
Stavrou, get us on a freeway.

1340
01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:30.180
We don't wanna be in this area

1341
01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:30.180
when these bombs start to fall.

1342
01:01:53.790 --> 01:01:56.040
Try to miss at least

1343
01:01:53.790 --> 01:01:56.040
one of the cars, Stavrou.

1344
01:01:57.920 --> 01:01:59.500
Just keep driving.

1345
01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:02.050
Off ramp is one mile ahead.

1346
01:02:08.930 --> 01:02:10.010
Jesus.

1347
01:02:11.350 --> 01:02:12.810
Look out.

1348
01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:22.360
The ramp, it's gone, lieutenant.

1349
01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:30.830
All right, Robertson exit,

1350
01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:30.830
half a click away.

1351
01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:34.330
Look out! Incoming, 12 o'clock!

1352
01:02:43.550 --> 01:02:45.420
-You okay?

1353
01:02:43.550 --> 01:02:45.420
-Harper!

1354
01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:55.640
Tank's drawing enemy fire!

1355
01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:55.640
It's a good time to move!

1356
01:02:55.850 --> 01:02:58.100
I'll suppress the fire,

1357
01:02:55.850 --> 01:02:58.100
you take the civilians!

1358
01:02:58.310 --> 01:03:00.310
Secure this exit, Imlay!

1359
01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:06.490
Imlay, get me a defensive line

1360
01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:06.490
on that vehicle!

1361
01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:12.950
-Move, move, move!

1362
01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:12.950
-Let's go! Come on.

1363
01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:15.710
-Let's go!

1364
01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:15.710
-Come on, stay down, stay down!

1365
01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:23.920
Just keep everybody calm.

1366
01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:23.920
We'll be right back, all right?

1367
01:03:24.130 --> 01:03:25.840
All right. Safety first, buddy.

1368
01:03:29.090 --> 01:03:33.930
Martinez, if we get the civilians to that

1369
01:03:29.090 --> 01:03:33.930
helo, they take cover, rappel down.

1370
01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:36.890
I got a dozen up on the bridge.

1371
01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:36.890
They're moving down.

1372
01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:40.480
Lieutenant! Tank's out!

1373
01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:40.480
Nothing's stopping them now!

1374
01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:47.240
Staff sergeant, civilians won't make it

1375
01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:47.240
to that helo without cover fire.

1376
01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:50.320
Lockett, Kerns, on me, let's go!

1377
01:03:50.530 --> 01:03:52.740
Let's move, let's move, let's move!

1378
01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:59.040
Get the civilians down, all right?

1379
01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:59.040
Move!

1380
01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:05.800
Come on!

1381
01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:10.760
About a 30-foot drop. Let's go.

1382
01:04:10.970 --> 01:04:15.430
Get behind the bus!

1383
01:04:10.970 --> 01:04:15.430
Now, now, now! Get behind it!

1384
01:04:15.890 --> 01:04:18.810
Kids first! Around the body,

1385
01:04:15.890 --> 01:04:18.810
bring them down one at a time.

1386
01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:20.390
Roger that.

1387
01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:23.610
Imlay!

1388
01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:26.400
Get your team

1389
01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:26.400
up on that garbage truck!

1390
01:04:26.610 --> 01:04:30.240
Staff sergeant, cover us up front!

1391
01:04:26.610 --> 01:04:30.240
Stavs, you're with me! On me now!

1392
01:04:32.030 --> 01:04:35.830
We're gonna run behind that helicopter

1393
01:04:32.030 --> 01:04:35.830
and we're gonna rope down, all right?

1394
01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:37.330
The girls will be first.

1395
01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:40.500
I promise you nothing's

1396
01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:40.500
gonna happen. Okay? Stay down!

1397
01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:45.500
Lieutenant, dozen hostiles,

1398
01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:45.500
maybe more!

1399
01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:48.210
Four hundred metres

1400
01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:48.210
and closing fast!

1401
01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:51.130
Cover, cover!

1402
01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:51.130
What the hell are you doing?

1403
01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:52.930
You guys need another gun.

1404
01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:56.890
Three o'clock. Up on the bridge,

1405
01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:56.890
Santos. Up on the bridge.

1406
01:04:57.100 --> 01:04:58.890
Incoming!

1407
01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:07.980
Ten o'clock!

1408
01:05:13.070 --> 01:05:15.240
-Reloading!

1409
01:05:13.070 --> 01:05:15.240
-Aim for the leader!

1410
01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:21.660
Hell, you can take all the room

1411
01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:21.660
you want.

1412
01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:24.130
Mottola, move, move, move!

1413
01:05:24.330 --> 01:05:28.960
Yes, staff sergeant! Come on, let's go!

1414
01:05:24.330 --> 01:05:28.960
Let's go, go, go! Run now, run!

1415
01:05:29.170 --> 01:05:32.760
Keep running! Don't stop, run!

1416
01:05:29.170 --> 01:05:32.760
Run, run, run!

1417
01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:41.890
-Get in there!

1418
01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:41.890
-Cover me!

1419
01:05:43.810 --> 01:05:46.730
-I'm going for the.50 cal!

1420
01:05:43.810 --> 01:05:46.730
-Hurry up!

1421
01:05:52.650 --> 01:05:54.320
Get some, Lockett.

1422
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:07.960
-Shit.

1423
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:07.960
-What the hell is that thing?

1424
01:06:08.170 --> 01:06:09.710
I'm engaging!

1425
01:06:13.090 --> 01:06:17.010
You'll be okay, all right? It's okay.

1426
01:06:13.090 --> 01:06:17.010
Listen to me. You're going to be okay.

1427
01:06:17.220 --> 01:06:20.180
I got you. I will not let anything

1428
01:06:17.220 --> 01:06:20.180
happen to you, all right?

1429
01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:27.770
Shit!

1430
01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:31.280
Man down!

1431
01:06:31.690 --> 01:06:34.820
You're gonna be okay. Hold on,

1432
01:06:31.690 --> 01:06:34.820
hold on! Keep going. Hold on!

1433
01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:37.030
Keep looking up!

1434
01:06:44.660 --> 01:06:46.170
Oh, God!

1435
01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:48.210
I got you. It's okay. It's okay.

1436
01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:51.300
Get the ant that's controlling

1437
01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:51.300
that thing!

1438
01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:56.130
Lockett, get off your ass!

1439
01:07:02.350 --> 01:07:03.600
It's turning this way!

1440
01:07:03.810 --> 01:07:06.730
It's about to hit the fan, guys.

1441
01:07:03.810 --> 01:07:06.730
Get out now! Move!

1442
01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:08.560
Santos, come on!

1443
01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:10.980
-Come on!

1444
01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:10.980
-I'm stuck.

1445
01:07:11.190 --> 01:07:12.480
Go!

1446
01:07:13.690 --> 01:07:15.530
-What are you doing?

1447
01:07:13.690 --> 01:07:15.530
-Go!

1448
01:07:17.110 --> 01:07:18.610
Imlay!

1449
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.250
Where's Stavrou?

1450
01:07:36.170 --> 01:07:37.680
Mottorola! How many down?

1451
01:07:39.390 --> 01:07:41.890
Two down, staff sarge! One to go!

1452
01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:44.520
Look at me, look at me. Look, look.

1453
01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:44.520
Be good, okay?

1454
01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:48.520
-It's gonna be fine, okay? You ready?

1455
01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:48.520
-Lieutenant, C-4!

1456
01:07:50.860 --> 01:07:52.480
Let's blow this sucker to hell!

1457
01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:54.980
Let's do it.

1458
01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:57.450
Kerns!

1459
01:08:04.030 --> 01:08:05.620
Covering!

1460
01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:18.840
All right, dough is good to go!

1461
01:08:19.050 --> 01:08:20.840
-Go!

1462
01:08:19.050 --> 01:08:20.840
-Covering!

1463
01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:28.680
Damn it! We've lost the detonator.

1464
01:08:29.770 --> 01:08:32.900
-You all right?

1465
01:08:29.770 --> 01:08:32.900
-Yeah, got the wind knocked out of me.

1466
01:08:39.780 --> 01:08:41.360
-Mottorola!

1467
01:08:39.780 --> 01:08:41.360
-Dad!

1468
01:08:41.820 --> 01:08:43.700
You're okay, Hector! You're okay.

1469
01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:45.280
Hold on!

1470
01:08:48.790 --> 01:08:51.710
-I need bandages from the first aid kit.

1471
01:08:48.790 --> 01:08:51.710
-Sir! Sir!

1472
01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:53.330
It's okay!

1473
01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:02.220
Oh, my God!

1474
01:09:03.090 --> 01:09:04.140
All right.

1475
01:09:19.610 --> 01:09:21.570
We gotta get you to a medevac.

1476
01:09:21.780 --> 01:09:23.280
Doc!

1477
01:09:27.450 --> 01:09:28.490
Oh, shit, man!

1478
01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:30.410
-We need some cover!

1479
01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:30.410
-Damn it, I'm out!

1480
01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:32.870
-Got another mag, Lockett?

1481
01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:32.870
-They kicking our ass!

1482
01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:35.380
You're getting pinned down,

1483
01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:35.380
staff sergeant!

1484
01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:37.880
Marines, you're getting pinned down!

1485
01:09:38.670 --> 01:09:41.170
-We're not leaving you.

1486
01:09:38.670 --> 01:09:41.170
-Staff sergeant, get them out!

1487
01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:43.430
-Lieutenant, I am not leav--

1488
01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:43.430
-Get them out!

1489
01:09:43.630 --> 01:09:45.680
-No, I'm not leaving you!

1490
01:09:43.630 --> 01:09:45.680
-Get them out!

1491
01:09:45.890 --> 01:09:46.930
No! Not again!

1492
01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:52.770
I have a bag of C-4 on the bus.

1493
01:09:53.730 --> 01:09:55.770
Give this to my wife...

1494
01:09:55.980 --> 01:09:58.690
...and get them off

1495
01:09:55.980 --> 01:09:58.690
this goddamn freeway.

1496
01:10:02.490 --> 01:10:03.990
That's an order.

1497
01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:08.780
Yes, sir.

1498
01:10:11.910 --> 01:10:13.580
Right behind you.

1499
01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:23.090
Cover the lieutenant!

1500
01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:27.470
Hey, I'm out!

1501
01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:35.230
They're closing in!

1502
01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:40.110
Here we go.

1503
01:10:46.110 --> 01:10:48.450
This is Lieutenant William Martinez...

1504
01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:52.160
...Echo Company, 2nd Battalion,

1505
01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:52.160
5th Marines. Hoorah!

1506
01:11:56.730 --> 01:11:59.770
We're still half a klick

1507
01:11:56.730 --> 01:11:59.770
inside the bombing zone.

1508
01:12:02.190 --> 01:12:04.320
Move to live, Marines.

1509
01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:11.820
Did he just leave the lieutenant

1510
01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:11.820
back there to die?

1511
01:12:12.030 --> 01:12:13.700
Sure looked that way.

1512
01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:16.500
And this is the guy

1513
01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:16.500
in charge of us now?

1514
01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:18.660
Let's move.

1515
01:12:21.710 --> 01:12:26.000
Hey, those are our jets.

1516
01:12:21.710 --> 01:12:26.000
We're still in the fight.

1517
01:12:27.630 --> 01:12:30.300
All right, we're clear of the bomb zone.

1518
01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:32.390
Let's tighten this place down.

1519
01:12:32.590 --> 01:12:34.260
Bombs drop in six minutes.

1520
01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:36.430
Santos, Kerns, on me.

1521
01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:40.390
Let's see if there are any comms.

1522
01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:40.390
All right? Hardwire only.

1523
01:12:59.710 --> 01:13:01.750
-Corporal Harris, we clear?

1524
01:12:59.710 --> 01:13:01.750
-We're clear!

1525
01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:04.960
-Do you have a hard line in here?

1526
01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:04.960
-Over there.

1527
01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:10.920
Now, my son's an optimist.

1528
01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:16.260
When this first happened, he said,

1529
01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:16.260
"Why don't we go try to talk to them?

1530
01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:19.640
Maybe they wanna be friends."

1531
01:13:22.730 --> 01:13:24.560
Hector? Hey.

1532
01:13:24.770 --> 01:13:27.900
We're gonna go get some food

1533
01:13:24.770 --> 01:13:27.900
and water for your dad, okay?

1534
01:13:28.570 --> 01:13:30.070
It's okay.

1535
01:13:31.030 --> 01:13:32.400
And what'd you tell him?

1536
01:13:32.610 --> 01:13:34.160
I said:

1537
01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:37.240
"You know, if they're chasing

1538
01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:37.240
and shooting us...

1539
01:13:37.450 --> 01:13:39.830
...they're probably not good friends."

1540
01:13:43.370 --> 01:13:46.420
I should've followed directions

1541
01:13:43.370 --> 01:13:46.420
and gone to the F.O.B.

1542
01:13:46.630 --> 01:13:50.090
I should've never stayed at the police

1543
01:13:46.630 --> 01:13:50.090
station, but I was scared, man.

1544
01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:54.380
I made all the wrong decisions.

1545
01:13:54.590 --> 01:13:56.850
You trusted your gut, Mr. Rincon.

1546
01:13:58.100 --> 01:13:59.930
You made a call.

1547
01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:02.890
I'd do the same thing

1548
01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:02.890
to protect my Marines.

1549
01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:12.240
-I had a situation my last tour.

1550
01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:12.240
-Yeah?

1551
01:14:13.450 --> 01:14:16.820
There was no right call. You went left

1552
01:14:13.450 --> 01:14:16.820
or you go right, it didn't matter.

1553
01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:21.790
But you're alive.

1554
01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.830
Yeah, I survived.

1555
01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:27.840
But I wasn't supposed to.

1556
01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:32.260
Staff Sergeant Nantz....

1557
01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:43.350
You promise to save my son?

1558
01:14:50.980 --> 01:14:53.900
Staff sergeant, we have

1559
01:14:50.980 --> 01:14:53.900
a hardwired connection!

1560
01:14:56.410 --> 01:14:59.410
Doc, keep him warm.

1561
01:14:56.410 --> 01:14:59.410
Sun is going down.

1562
01:15:00.410 --> 01:15:02.160
This will keep you warm.

1563
01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:06.870
We're estimating that 20 cities in 1 7

1564
01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:06.870
countries are now under full attack.

1565
01:15:07.210 --> 01:15:10.920
It's obvious the enemy is attempting

1566
01:15:07.210 --> 01:15:10.920
to cut us off from one another.

1567
01:15:11.130 --> 01:15:14.340
Is there any more information

1568
01:15:11.130 --> 01:15:14.340
at this time, Professor Stavert?

1569
01:15:14.550 --> 01:15:17.340
New data shows that they're using

1570
01:15:14.550 --> 01:15:17.340
our water as their fuel...

1571
01:15:17.510 --> 01:15:19.680
...and our ocean levels

1572
01:15:17.510 --> 01:15:19.680
are already decreasing.

1573
01:15:19.890 --> 01:15:22.810
They are using it to power their ships,

1574
01:15:19.890 --> 01:15:22.810
their machinery...

1575
01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:26.980
...possibly their own bodies. It's the

1576
01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:26.980
composition of our water that's unique.

1577
01:15:27.190 --> 01:15:30.560
It's in a liquid state. No other

1578
01:15:27.190 --> 01:15:30.560
locations in our known universe...

1579
01:15:30.770 --> 01:15:33.400
...have liquid H2O

1580
01:15:30.770 --> 01:15:33.400
anywhere near their surface.

1581
01:15:33.610 --> 01:15:37.240
I just saw a field report that said

1582
01:15:33.610 --> 01:15:37.240
they will use our sewage systems...

1583
01:15:37.450 --> 01:15:40.820
-...to follow our water to their ships.

1584
01:15:37.450 --> 01:15:40.820
-How'd you get that to work?

1585
01:15:40.990 --> 01:15:45.040
These things are everywhere. There's

1586
01:15:40.990 --> 01:15:45.040
one off the coast of 20 countries.

1587
01:15:45.250 --> 01:15:47.870
They're calling it

1588
01:15:45.250 --> 01:15:47.870
the command-and-control centre.

1589
01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.750
-That's the thing you were tracking?

1590
01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.750
-Yeah.

1591
01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:55.760
So you're saying that's the thing

1592
01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:55.760
that's controlling the drones?

1593
01:15:55.960 --> 01:16:00.590
Yeah. And if we wipe it out,

1594
01:15:55.960 --> 01:16:00.590
we take out their air power.

1595
01:16:03.260 --> 01:16:05.060
These bombs better work.

1596
01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:07.520
-Let's move it.

1597
01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:07.520
-Bring him through here.

1598
01:16:07.810 --> 01:16:10.770
-Set him down.

1599
01:16:07.810 --> 01:16:10.770
-How much time we got?

1600
01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:12.650
One minute.

1601
01:16:15.820 --> 01:16:19.200
Air Force about to lay some pain

1602
01:16:15.820 --> 01:16:19.200
on those extraterritorial bastards.

1603
01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:24.490
-All right, Two-Five, retreat....

1604
01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:24.490
-Hell!

1605
01:16:24.700 --> 01:16:26.620
-Retreat....

1606
01:16:24.700 --> 01:16:26.620
-Hell!

1607
01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:29.160
Here we go.

1608
01:16:29.330 --> 01:16:31.790
Come on.

1609
01:16:29.330 --> 01:16:31.790
Let's fry these sons of bitches.

1610
01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.540
We get to the F.O.B.

1611
01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.540
after these bombs drop, get ammo.

1612
01:16:34.710 --> 01:16:37.970
And some goddamn reinforcements.

1613
01:16:34.710 --> 01:16:37.970
Some goddamn tanks.

1614
01:16:43.050 --> 01:16:44.970
-Ten.

1615
01:16:43.050 --> 01:16:44.970
-Gotta be strong, okay?

1616
01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:46.640
Nine.

1617
01:16:46.850 --> 01:16:48.520
Eight.

1618
01:16:48.730 --> 01:16:50.020
Seven.

1619
01:16:50.230 --> 01:16:51.770
Six.

1620
01:16:51.980 --> 01:16:53.360
Five.

1621
01:16:53.940 --> 01:16:55.360
Four.

1622
01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:57.780
Three....

1623
01:16:58.940 --> 01:17:00.860
Shit. Everybody, brace!

1624
01:17:21.930 --> 01:17:23.800
-They should've dropped.

1625
01:17:21.930 --> 01:17:23.800
-What the hell?

1626
01:17:24.010 --> 01:17:27.680
Wouldn't we have felt that from here if

1627
01:17:24.010 --> 01:17:27.680
they'd dropped? We would've felt them.

1628
01:17:27.890 --> 01:17:30.100
Would've felt it in Nevada

1629
01:17:27.890 --> 01:17:30.100
with that ordnance.

1630
01:17:30.310 --> 01:17:31.810
That clock right?

1631
01:17:32.020 --> 01:17:33.270
That's what I got.

1632
01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:36.770
Maybe it's a good thing. Maybe we

1633
01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:36.770
turned the tide. That's a good thing.

1634
01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:39.360
You damn straight, Imlay.

1635
01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:39.360
We was kicking some ass.

1636
01:17:39.570 --> 01:17:42.240
Could they have taken out

1637
01:17:39.570 --> 01:17:42.240
the whole Air Force?

1638
01:17:42.450 --> 01:17:44.160
This isn't happening.

1639
01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:45.490
Let's move.

1640
01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:47.780
Everybody, up, up. Let's move.

1641
01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:47.780
Come on.

1642
01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:50.830
We're in the home stretch, everybody.

1643
01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:50.830
We in the home stretch.

1644
01:18:08.810 --> 01:18:11.430
Now we know why

1645
01:18:08.810 --> 01:18:11.430
those bombs didn't drop.

1646
01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:15.350
They wiped our forward

1647
01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:15.350
operating base right off the map.

1648
01:18:17.110 --> 01:18:19.320
All clear, staff sergeant!

1649
01:18:19.570 --> 01:18:22.280
All right, let's bring him back here.

1650
01:18:26.490 --> 01:18:27.530
Hang in there, buddy.

1651
01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:30.330
Million-and-one odds

1652
01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:30.330
we'd get here in the first place...

1653
01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:34.790
...we get here and there ain't nothing.

1654
01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:34.790
I knew Nantz would never get us out.

1655
01:18:36.830 --> 01:18:40.840
-There were thousands of Marines here.

1656
01:18:36.830 --> 01:18:40.840
-Now it's just seven of us, Imlay.

1657
01:18:42.590 --> 01:18:44.880
You remind me of my older brother.

1658
01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:47.470
How's that?

1659
01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:50.510
He never smiles either.

1660
01:18:53.980 --> 01:18:55.520
Secure the front with Harris.

1661
01:18:57.520 --> 01:18:59.020
Imlay, anything?

1662
01:18:59.230 --> 01:19:01.270
Nothing.

1663
01:18:59.230 --> 01:19:01.270
We only got maps of Santa Monica.

1664
01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:04.070
We need something farther east.

1665
01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:04.070
They're all burned.

1666
01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:05.360
Follow me, Imlay.

1667
01:19:10.330 --> 01:19:13.160
All right, here's the

1668
01:19:10.330 --> 01:19:13.160
battalion commander's hooch.

1669
01:19:13.330 --> 01:19:15.750
Looking for maps,

1670
01:19:13.330 --> 01:19:15.750
anything with an extraction point.

1671
01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:17.710
Staff sergeant.

1672
01:19:27.010 --> 01:19:28.800
I'll be right back.

1673
01:19:35.140 --> 01:19:37.230
Found a tactical map, staff sergeant.

1674
01:19:37.390 --> 01:19:39.810
Shows where all the units

1675
01:19:37.390 --> 01:19:39.810
were deployed.

1676
01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:43.480
-What the hell are all these red marks?

1677
01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:43.480
-Means they're gone.

1678
01:19:43.690 --> 01:19:46.740
-You mean the units got moved?

1679
01:19:43.690 --> 01:19:46.740
-Wiped out.

1680
01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:49.780
-All of them?

1681
01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:49.780
-All of them.

1682
01:19:49.990 --> 01:19:51.240
Oh, shit.

1683
01:19:51.450 --> 01:19:55.580
All right. One alternate extraction site

1684
01:19:51.450 --> 01:19:55.580
is still operational.

1685
01:19:56.330 --> 01:19:58.040
That's eight klicks.

1686
01:19:58.250 --> 01:20:02.040
Staff sergeant? Staff sergeant.

1687
01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:05.760
Adukwu, plenty of weapons around.

1688
01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:05.760
Find yourself an M-16.

1689
01:20:06.170 --> 01:20:07.510
Mr. Rincon is dead.

1690
01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:33.830
Wake up, Dad.

1691
01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:44.750
Please help me right now.

1692
01:20:46.670 --> 01:20:48.420
Don't leave me.

1693
01:20:53.970 --> 01:20:56.350
I'm so sorry, Hector.

1694
01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:01.900
I'm sorry.

1695
01:21:02.980 --> 01:21:04.110
No.

1696
01:21:04.270 --> 01:21:08.110
Your dad tried so hard

1697
01:21:04.270 --> 01:21:08.110
to stay with you.

1698
01:21:09.610 --> 01:21:11.860
-I'm sorr--

1699
01:21:09.610 --> 01:21:11.860
-I don't wanna be here.

1700
01:21:18.830 --> 01:21:20.500
It's okay, bud.

1701
01:21:27.670 --> 01:21:30.550
Your father was a brave man, Hector.

1702
01:21:39.810 --> 01:21:44.350
Hector, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, buddy.

1703
01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:46.650
It's okay to cry.

1704
01:21:51.900 --> 01:21:54.160
He loved you very much.

1705
01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:57.160
Listen to me, Hector.

1706
01:21:58.830 --> 01:22:02.870
I need you to be brave for me.

1707
01:21:58.830 --> 01:22:02.870
I need you to be my little Marine.

1708
01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.380
Okay?

1709
01:22:09.340 --> 01:22:11.630
We gotta be brave for the others.

1710
01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:16.090
Do you know why?

1711
01:22:18.050 --> 01:22:19.560
Why?

1712
01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:25.190
Because Marines don't quit.

1713
01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:28.820
Do you believe that?

1714
01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:32.570
Say it for me.

1715
01:22:35.700 --> 01:22:39.280
-Marines don't quit.

1716
01:22:35.700 --> 01:22:39.280
-Good.

1717
01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:43.830
I'm gonna get you out of here, Hector.

1718
01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:43.830
I promise.

1719
01:22:47.460 --> 01:22:50.210
Let's go see the girls, okay? Come on.

1720
01:23:08.190 --> 01:23:11.610
We are not losing one more

1721
01:23:08.190 --> 01:23:11.610
of those civilians. Understand?

1722
01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:16.740
You getting us out too, staff sergeant?

1723
01:23:18.910 --> 01:23:20.620
Or are we expendable?

1724
01:23:30.420 --> 01:23:32.170
All right, Lockett.

1725
01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.260
You wanna go there, let's go there.

1726
01:23:39.550 --> 01:23:42.260
I commanded men and men died.

1727
01:23:42.510 --> 01:23:47.190
Kids. 19 years old.

1728
01:23:42.510 --> 01:23:47.190
The best men I ever led.

1729
01:23:47.940 --> 01:23:52.770
Do you think for one second I wouldn't

1730
01:23:47.940 --> 01:23:52.770
rather trade places with them?

1731
01:23:59.030 --> 01:24:01.780
I know you think I got my men killed.

1732
01:24:04.660 --> 01:24:06.160
They're dead.

1733
01:24:07.790 --> 01:24:09.290
I'm here.

1734
01:24:10.130 --> 01:24:12.630
Like the punch line to some bad joke.

1735
01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:14.800
You think I like that?

1736
01:24:15.130 --> 01:24:18.430
Do you think a minute goes by

1737
01:24:15.130 --> 01:24:18.430
that those faces aren't right here...

1738
01:24:18.630 --> 01:24:20.800
...seared into my brain?

1739
01:24:24.140 --> 01:24:28.640
Dante, Thomas T. Corporal.

1740
01:24:24.140 --> 01:24:28.640
1-5-6-5-0-9-3-8-6.

1741
01:24:28.810 --> 01:24:34.480
Ambruster, William R. Private.

1742
01:24:28.810 --> 01:24:34.480
8-7-6-6-6-2-3-5-4.

1743
01:24:35.190 --> 01:24:37.740
Wharton, Jeffrey H.

1744
01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:42.990
Lance Corporal. 8-7-4-2-7-3-9-9-3.

1745
01:24:46.910 --> 01:24:48.460
Lockett...

1746
01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:54.420
...Duane G.

1747
01:24:56.090 --> 01:24:57.710
Corporal.

1748
01:24:59.340 --> 01:25:04.010
1-5-6-8-7-0-9....

1749
01:25:04.350 --> 01:25:06.140
Five-five.

1750
01:25:08.220 --> 01:25:10.980
Your brother

1751
01:25:08.220 --> 01:25:10.980
was an outstanding Marine.

1752
01:25:13.650 --> 01:25:14.810
He was my friend.

1753
01:25:15.940 --> 01:25:20.820
And I miss him every day.

1754
01:25:23.870 --> 01:25:25.370
And you remind me of him.

1755
01:25:34.710 --> 01:25:36.880
None of that matters right now.

1756
01:25:38.710 --> 01:25:42.630
Because our duty is to keep

1757
01:25:38.710 --> 01:25:42.630
moving forwards, to keep fighting.

1758
01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:45.510
That's how we honour your brother...

1759
01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:47.890
...and Lieutenant Martinez...

1760
01:25:48.140 --> 01:25:50.140
...Corporal Stavrou...

1761
01:25:50.350 --> 01:25:52.350
...Lance Corporal Mottola...

1762
01:25:53.230 --> 01:25:54.350
...Hector's father...

1763
01:25:55.230 --> 01:25:58.570
...who picked up a rifle and did what

1764
01:25:55.230 --> 01:25:58.570
needed to be done. A civilian.

1765
01:25:58.780 --> 01:26:01.150
So we better damn well step it up.

1766
01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:03.400
Discard any lingering doubt.

1767
01:26:03.990 --> 01:26:06.570
Work fast, work as a unit,

1768
01:26:03.990 --> 01:26:06.570
and we will prevail.

1769
01:26:06.820 --> 01:26:09.080
Let's figure out

1770
01:26:06.820 --> 01:26:09.080
how we're gonna get out of this.

1771
01:26:09.330 --> 01:26:11.410
Imlay, you come with me.

1772
01:26:09.330 --> 01:26:11.410
Get to higher ground.

1773
01:26:11.660 --> 01:26:14.210
The rest of you, find some ammo

1774
01:26:11.660 --> 01:26:14.210
and some vehicles.

1775
01:26:14.420 --> 01:26:17.920
Gotta be a few LAV's or armoured

1776
01:26:14.420 --> 01:26:17.920
Humvees still operational.

1777
01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:22.010
Sorry, bro. You didn't deserve this.

1778
01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:27.720
You went down fighting.

1779
01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:35.560
Holy shit.

1780
01:26:35.770 --> 01:26:37.770
I wasn't expecting to see all this.

1781
01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:41.110
That don't look good.

1782
01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:42.610
Reinforcements.

1783
01:26:46.910 --> 01:26:49.030
Holy shit.

1784
01:26:50.790 --> 01:26:53.040
They already set up a beachhead.

1785
01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:55.250
All right.

1786
01:26:56.870 --> 01:27:01.050
If that evac site is still operational,

1787
01:26:56.870 --> 01:27:01.050
I think we can get behind the line.

1788
01:27:01.250 --> 01:27:03.130
That's gonna be one hell of a ride.

1789
01:27:03.380 --> 01:27:05.300
Yeah, well, that's what we get paid for.

1790
01:27:05.470 --> 01:27:09.100
Everybody move to the LAV now! Go!

1791
01:27:09.300 --> 01:27:11.810
Any station, this net.

1792
01:27:09.300 --> 01:27:11.810
This is Foxtrot-Two-November.

1793
01:27:11.970 --> 01:27:13.140
We have 11 passengers.

1794
01:27:13.390 --> 01:27:17.650
Requesting evacuation at alternate

1795
01:27:13.390 --> 01:27:17.650
extraction point Charlie.

1796
01:27:17.850 --> 01:27:19.860
Are there any birds in the air? Over.

1797
01:27:20.060 --> 01:27:23.860
Foxtrot-Two-November, this is

1798
01:27:20.060 --> 01:27:23.860
Sierra 2-5. Orders are to pull back.

1799
01:27:24.070 --> 01:27:28.160
Get to extraction point Charlie

1800
01:27:24.070 --> 01:27:28.160
by 0300 or we'll be gone. Over.

1801
01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:31.330
Roger that. 0300, not a minute more.

1802
01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:31.330
Out.

1803
01:27:33.410 --> 01:27:35.790
Imlay, ever see what

1804
01:27:33.410 --> 01:27:35.790
a Bushmaster chain gun can do?

1805
01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.460
-Oh, shit, yes, staff sergeant.

1806
01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.460
-Get on it, son.

1807
01:27:38.670 --> 01:27:40.670
Let's do this!

1808
01:27:44.670 --> 01:27:46.170
-No lights, Kerns.

1809
01:27:44.670 --> 01:27:46.170
-Roger that.

1810
01:27:47.180 --> 01:27:48.800
Let's move.

1811
01:27:52.010 --> 01:27:53.640
Bushmaster is locked and loaded.

1812
01:27:53.850 --> 01:27:55.100
Give them hell.

1813
01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:56.810
Damn right.

1814
01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:10.530
Two minutes till that helo drops.

1815
01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:14.950
Everybody okay?

1816
01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:21.040
All right, Kerns, take a left.

1817
01:28:21.210 --> 01:28:24.460
I want you to go over three blocks,

1818
01:28:21.210 --> 01:28:24.460
then you go about five blocks...

1819
01:28:24.670 --> 01:28:26.550
...hang a right, and straight.

1820
01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:29.630
-That should get us to the evac site.

1821
01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:29.630
-Yes, staff sergeant.

1822
01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:35.560
-I'd hold on if I were you, Lockett!

1823
01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:35.560
-Copy that!

1824
01:28:37.390 --> 01:28:39.230
-We got hostiles.

1825
01:28:37.390 --> 01:28:39.230
-What's going on?

1826
01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:42.400
-Let's not wait around and find out.

1827
01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:42.400
-It's gonna be okay.

1828
01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:45.400
Got about 250 rounds, staff sergeant.

1829
01:28:53.490 --> 01:28:55.240
Know what they say if you hit a deer?

1830
01:28:55.490 --> 01:28:57.250
-Speed up!

1831
01:28:55.490 --> 01:28:57.250
-Damn straight!

1832
01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:04.500
-Come on!

1833
01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:04.500
-Y'all hold on!

1834
01:29:04.710 --> 01:29:07.260
We're gonna have to go

1835
01:29:04.710 --> 01:29:07.260
right through them!

1836
01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:15.430
-You saw that?

1837
01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:15.430
-They're going down like bowling pins!

1838
01:29:39.870 --> 01:29:41.410
Kick it out!

1839
01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:44.420
Run that sucker over, man!

1840
01:29:46.750 --> 01:29:47.880
Santos, you okay?

1841
01:29:48.710 --> 01:29:51.590
I got that nasty stuff

1842
01:29:48.710 --> 01:29:51.590
all over my mouth, man!

1843
01:29:54.140 --> 01:29:57.970
-It's not funny.

1844
01:29:54.140 --> 01:29:57.970
-You let him do you on the first date.

1845
01:30:11.820 --> 01:30:14.490
-Everyone okay?

1846
01:30:11.820 --> 01:30:14.490
-Yes!

1847
01:30:15.870 --> 01:30:17.070
Let's get us home.

1848
01:30:23.500 --> 01:30:25.500
Cease fire!

1849
01:30:30.130 --> 01:30:32.510
-Stay close, stay close!

1850
01:30:30.130 --> 01:30:32.510
-What are we doing?

1851
01:30:36.180 --> 01:30:39.600
Load them up! Our flight path

1852
01:30:36.180 --> 01:30:39.600
won't be clear much longer!

1853
01:30:39.810 --> 01:30:41.770
You're in the middle of the shit,

1854
01:30:39.810 --> 01:30:41.770
sergeant!

1855
01:30:41.930 --> 01:30:43.390
What happened to all our air?

1856
01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:46.940
Pulled back to save our assets!

1857
01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:46.940
They were blowing us out!

1858
01:30:47.150 --> 01:30:48.820
We're abandoning Los Angeles!

1859
01:30:58.660 --> 01:31:00.660
Let's go, Imlay!

1860
01:31:00.990 --> 01:31:02.700
Son, you okay?

1861
01:31:04.580 --> 01:31:05.960
All right.

1862
01:31:07.380 --> 01:31:09.790
Let's move! Move, move!

1863
01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:13.010
Come on, Harris, let's go!

1864
01:31:55.010 --> 01:31:56.470
Hold on!

1865
01:31:59.430 --> 01:32:01.050
-You all right?

1866
01:31:59.430 --> 01:32:01.050
-Everybody all good?

1867
01:32:01.260 --> 01:32:03.510
-Girls?

1868
01:32:01.260 --> 01:32:03.510
-Everybody okay?

1869
01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:05.350
Hold on tight!

1870
01:32:07.180 --> 01:32:08.390
What happened?

1871
01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:11.860
Pilot said something

1872
01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:11.860
was playing hell with our power!

1873
01:32:12.060 --> 01:32:15.440
Staff sergeant! Nine o'clock!

1874
01:32:21.370 --> 01:32:24.540
Santos, you said you were tracking

1875
01:32:21.370 --> 01:32:24.540
massive RF signals?

1876
01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:27.330
Could a concentration of them

1877
01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:27.330
knock out power?

1878
01:32:29.460 --> 01:32:31.420
Yes, definitely! Why?

1879
01:32:31.790 --> 01:32:34.170
Could be their

1880
01:32:31.790 --> 01:32:34.170
command-and-control centre!

1881
01:32:37.510 --> 01:32:39.010
Get me down there!

1882
01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:40.640
What?

1883
01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:44.060
I gotta recon that area!

1884
01:32:44.260 --> 01:32:46.560
No way! It's a suicide!

1885
01:32:46.770 --> 01:32:50.520
Damn it, we're the only ones left!

1886
01:32:46.770 --> 01:32:50.520
All the other forces have fallen back!

1887
01:32:50.730 --> 01:32:55.320
We can't land! May not have power

1888
01:32:50.730 --> 01:32:55.320
to take off again!

1889
01:33:02.700 --> 01:33:05.080
This is a letter for Martinez's wife.

1890
01:33:06.450 --> 01:33:08.000
Will you get it to her?

1891
01:33:11.330 --> 01:33:12.710
Yeah.

1892
01:33:18.090 --> 01:33:20.760
Hover at 40 feet!

1893
01:33:21.260 --> 01:33:22.680
-Twenty seconds!

1894
01:33:21.260 --> 01:33:22.680
-Roger that!

1895
01:33:27.220 --> 01:33:29.680
Come on, Adukwu, let's get this off.

1896
01:33:29.890 --> 01:33:32.100
Staff sergeant, what the hell

1897
01:33:29.890 --> 01:33:32.100
are you doing?

1898
01:33:32.310 --> 01:33:35.310
We're in the clear!

1899
01:33:32.310 --> 01:33:35.310
We're almost home, Imlay!

1900
01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:37.610
You're in charge now!

1901
01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:41.150
You get these civilians home safe!

1902
01:33:45.450 --> 01:33:47.830
You're the bravest Marine I ever seen,

1903
01:33:45.450 --> 01:33:47.830
Hector!

1904
01:33:49.250 --> 01:33:50.790
No!

1905
01:34:34.750 --> 01:34:36.790
Everybody, take cover.

1906
01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:41.340
I told you to stay in that helo.

1907
01:34:41.550 --> 01:34:45.050
Civilians are free and clear.

1908
01:34:41.550 --> 01:34:45.050
We were worried about your ass.

1909
01:34:45.430 --> 01:34:47.640
I think the command-and-control asset

1910
01:34:45.430 --> 01:34:47.640
is nearby.

1911
01:34:48.220 --> 01:34:50.350
Kerns, how many klicks

1912
01:34:48.220 --> 01:34:50.350
to that blackout?

1913
01:34:50.810 --> 01:34:53.020
It's about five klicks, staff sergeant.

1914
01:34:53.230 --> 01:34:54.690
Five klicks. All right.

1915
01:34:55.270 --> 01:34:57.400
We're gonna use this overpass

1916
01:34:55.270 --> 01:34:57.400
for cover.

1917
01:34:58.690 --> 01:35:00.110
If we take out those drones...

1918
01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:03.820
...our military might have a chance

1919
01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:03.820
to get back into this fight.

1920
01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:05.820
Santos...

1921
01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:09.910
...where would you put a command and

1922
01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:09.910
control asset if you wanted to protect it?

1923
01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:12.950
-Underground.

1924
01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:12.950
-Let's go.

1925
01:35:14.620 --> 01:35:17.750
Everybody, let's move. Come on.

1926
01:35:14.620 --> 01:35:17.750
Move, move, move.

1927
01:35:43.230 --> 01:35:44.280
Move.

1928
01:36:38.710 --> 01:36:41.460
They must've gone back up.

1929
01:36:38.710 --> 01:36:41.460
Just leads up to the street.

1930
01:36:41.670 --> 01:36:44.750
I thought they were leading us

1931
01:36:41.670 --> 01:36:44.750
to the command-and-control centre.

1932
01:36:45.210 --> 01:36:46.670
Damn it.

1933
01:36:51.010 --> 01:36:53.180
Let's go. Back.

1934
01:37:01.810 --> 01:37:04.150
Holy shit!

1935
01:37:04.730 --> 01:37:06.860
Santos!

1936
01:37:22.250 --> 01:37:24.130
They know we're here now.

1937
01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:36.970
That's their command-and-control.

1938
01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:45.270
Everybody out now!

1939
01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:45.270
Move, move, move! Follow me!

1940
01:37:45.770 --> 01:37:49.490
Up here! Up that ladder, go!

1941
01:37:45.770 --> 01:37:49.490
Move, move, move! Up that ladder!

1942
01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:52.610
Let's go! Move it up!

1943
01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:52.610
Blow that grate, Imlay!

1944
01:37:54.030 --> 01:37:55.240
Move, move, move!

1945
01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:03.790
We're right over their command asset.

1946
01:38:04.290 --> 01:38:09.050
That's it, all right. Let's move the

1947
01:38:04.290 --> 01:38:09.050
concrete slab, 1 o'clock. Let's move.

1948
01:38:11.220 --> 01:38:12.470
Fire in the hole!

1949
01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:15.010
That should give us a couple minutes.

1950
01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:34.410
Laser target, staff sergeant?

1951
01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:34.410
We don't have any more jets, though.

1952
01:38:34.610 --> 01:38:37.740
They can fire ground-to-ground

1953
01:38:34.610 --> 01:38:37.740
missiles from Edwards Air Force Base.

1954
01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:40.410
We radio in a strike,

1955
01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:40.410
paint the target with the laser.

1956
01:38:40.620 --> 01:38:42.290
-Aye-aye, staff sergeant.

1957
01:38:40.620 --> 01:38:42.290
-Hoorah.

1958
01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:45.540
Our best chance at radio reception

1959
01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:45.540
is on top of that building...

1960
01:38:45.710 --> 01:38:47.130
...but it's the most exposed.

1961
01:38:47.330 --> 01:38:49.800
I'll do it, staff sergeant.

1962
01:38:47.330 --> 01:38:49.800
I'll make the call.

1963
01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.460
Santos, you got those codes?

1964
01:38:51.670 --> 01:38:53.720
Air Force strike package coming up.

1965
01:38:55.300 --> 01:38:58.510
You get to high ground. Once you

1966
01:38:55.300 --> 01:38:58.510
radio in, they'll track that signal.

1967
01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:00.260
Things are gonna get real hot.

1968
01:39:00.470 --> 01:39:03.810
So once you make that call,

1969
01:39:00.470 --> 01:39:03.810
you get the hell out of there, all right?

1970
01:39:04.350 --> 01:39:05.520
You know what that means?

1971
01:39:05.730 --> 01:39:08.900
We're gonna have to hold those

1972
01:39:05.730 --> 01:39:08.900
things off till the strike gets here.

1973
01:39:09.110 --> 01:39:11.110
Bingo. Marines...

1974
01:39:12.570 --> 01:39:16.780
...we make our stand here. Let those

1975
01:39:12.570 --> 01:39:16.780
bastards know who they're fucking with.

1976
01:39:16.990 --> 01:39:18.030
-Retreat....

1977
01:39:16.990 --> 01:39:18.030
-Hell!

1978
01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:19.700
Two-Five.

1979
01:39:30.540 --> 01:39:32.880
-Right of the heart, right?

1980
01:39:30.540 --> 01:39:32.880
-Right of the heart.

1981
01:39:33.420 --> 01:39:35.670
They're gonna be coming up

1982
01:39:33.420 --> 01:39:35.670
from there. Take two.

1983
01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:38.260
Plant one there and the other one

1984
01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:38.260
on the other side.

1985
01:39:38.470 --> 01:39:41.100
-Keep your head down, get it done.

1986
01:39:38.470 --> 01:39:41.100
-Doc, watch your back!

1987
01:39:41.310 --> 01:39:43.430
Watch your head! Watch it!

1988
01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:54.400
Any station, this is

1989
01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:54.400
Foxtrot-Two-November, do you copy?

1990
01:39:57.400 --> 01:40:00.160
Any station, this is

1991
01:39:57.400 --> 01:40:00.160
Foxtrot-Two-November, do you copy?

1992
01:40:00.370 --> 01:40:02.620
Foxtrot-Two-November,

1993
01:40:00.370 --> 01:40:02.620
this is Yankee-Tango, over.

1994
01:40:02.830 --> 01:40:06.330
We have a priority fire mission. We've

1995
01:40:02.830 --> 01:40:06.330
located an enemy command centre...

1996
01:40:06.580 --> 01:40:10.040
...under grid 885-342.

1997
01:40:10.250 --> 01:40:13.170
We will be lasing. Code 1-2-0.

1998
01:40:13.380 --> 01:40:15.800
I say again, we will be lasing.

1999
01:40:13.380 --> 01:40:15.800
Code 1-2-0.

2000
01:40:16.010 --> 01:40:18.550
Copy that.

2001
01:40:16.010 --> 01:40:18.550
Time to target, three minutes.

2002
01:40:20.550 --> 01:40:21.600
Staff sergeant!

2003
01:40:22.390 --> 01:40:25.680
We got three minutes!

2004
01:40:22.390 --> 01:40:25.680
It's coming in three minutes!

2005
01:40:25.890 --> 01:40:28.730
All right. Let's paint this target.

2006
01:40:40.490 --> 01:40:42.870
Hell of a shot, Kerns!

2007
01:40:40.490 --> 01:40:42.870
Get your ass out of there!

2008
01:40:44.660 --> 01:40:47.120
Get out of there, Kerns! Shit.

2009
01:40:51.130 --> 01:40:53.090
-Shit!

2010
01:40:51.130 --> 01:40:53.090
-Kerns!

2011
01:40:56.050 --> 01:40:58.510
Shit! Shit!

2012
01:41:02.850 --> 01:41:05.600
Doc, Doc! Get to cover now!

2013
01:41:02.850 --> 01:41:05.600
Move, move!

2014
01:41:05.810 --> 01:41:07.390
Shit.

2015
01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:12.270
Contact! Twelve o'clock!

2016
01:41:13.190 --> 01:41:14.980
Covering up front!

2017
01:41:15.190 --> 01:41:17.190
-Go, go, go!

2018
01:41:15.190 --> 01:41:17.190
-Go on, get in there!

2019
01:41:18.940 --> 01:41:20.740
Shift fire left! Shift fire left!

2020
01:41:21.910 --> 01:41:23.450
Right there, right there!

2021
01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:30.410
Got it!

2022
01:41:31.290 --> 01:41:33.130
Sixty seconds left.

2023
01:41:42.930 --> 01:41:45.430
-Lockett!

2024
01:41:42.930 --> 01:41:45.430
-Shit!

2025
01:41:49.020 --> 01:41:50.430
Let's go!

2026
01:41:57.980 --> 01:42:00.150
Back in the fight, Santos!

2027
01:42:00.940 --> 01:42:02.780
-Need a little help!

2028
01:42:00.940 --> 01:42:02.780
-Covering!

2029
01:42:02.990 --> 01:42:05.030
Imlay, use your grenade launcher!

2030
01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:07.410
-I got it, Doc!

2031
01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:07.410
-Covering!

2032
01:42:15.580 --> 01:42:18.250
Where's that goddamn artillery?

2033
01:42:15.580 --> 01:42:18.250
Should've hit by now.

2034
01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:21.510
Doc, let's go!

2035
01:42:25.050 --> 01:42:27.470
-Doc?

2036
01:42:25.050 --> 01:42:27.470
-Imlay! Imlay!

2037
01:42:36.230 --> 01:42:37.940
Incoming!

2038
01:42:43.320 --> 01:42:44.660
Yes!

2039
01:42:45.490 --> 01:42:48.160
Santos, we got it! We got it!

2040
01:42:50.040 --> 01:42:53.080
Direct hit! Direct hit!

2041
01:42:53.250 --> 01:42:54.540
Staff sergeant, you did it!

2042
01:42:58.090 --> 01:42:59.380
Yes, we got it!

2043
01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:02.380
The strike package. It went through?

2044
01:43:03.010 --> 01:43:05.380
-It came through?

2045
01:43:03.010 --> 01:43:05.380
-Yeah! All right, Kerns!

2046
01:43:06.550 --> 01:43:07.970
It's over.

2047
01:43:25.070 --> 01:43:26.700
It's coming up. It's coming up.

2048
01:43:38.920 --> 01:43:41.380
They're trying to get away.

2049
01:43:46.380 --> 01:43:49.720
The goddamn thing can fly,

2050
01:43:46.380 --> 01:43:49.720
staff sergeant. It's flying now!

2051
01:43:49.930 --> 01:43:51.100
I'll get you out!

2052
01:43:59.270 --> 01:44:01.860
We gotta protect the laser.

2053
01:43:59.270 --> 01:44:01.860
Come on. Come on!

2054
01:44:03.780 --> 01:44:05.320
Santos!

2055
01:44:15.620 --> 01:44:17.120
Son of a bitch!

2056
01:44:19.670 --> 01:44:22.630
-That hurt!

2057
01:44:19.670 --> 01:44:22.630
-Cover me, Lockett!

2058
01:44:28.010 --> 01:44:31.390
The drones are pulling it away!

2059
01:44:28.010 --> 01:44:31.390
We gotta take it out now!

2060
01:44:35.020 --> 01:44:37.310
Incoming Copperhead!

2061
01:44:42.020 --> 01:44:44.860
They're using the drone

2062
01:44:42.020 --> 01:44:44.860
to protect the ship!

2063
01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:50.160
I'm running low on ammo!

2064
01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:51.780
Santos!

2065
01:44:56.080 --> 01:44:59.120
-How is he?

2066
01:44:56.080 --> 01:44:59.120
-He's hanging in there, staff sergeant!

2067
01:44:59.330 --> 01:45:01.460
Crazy bastard.

2068
01:44:59.330 --> 01:45:01.460
You should've left me there.

2069
01:45:06.130 --> 01:45:07.630
Covering!

2070
01:45:08.550 --> 01:45:09.760
Grenade!

2071
01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:19.060
-Staff sergeant!

2072
01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:19.060
-We are not dying here, Lockett!

2073
01:45:19.310 --> 01:45:21.350
You damn right we're not dying!

2074
01:45:22.850 --> 01:45:25.110
It's getting out of range!

2075
01:45:22.850 --> 01:45:25.110
I gotta take it down!

2076
01:45:25.320 --> 01:45:27.320
Doesn't have enough punch!

2077
01:45:25.320 --> 01:45:27.320
Save that shot!

2078
01:45:36.910 --> 01:45:38.700
Staff sergeant!

2079
01:45:38.910 --> 01:45:40.210
Lockett, you okay?

2080
01:45:40.410 --> 01:45:42.370
Harris, you're gonna be okay.

2081
01:46:06.770 --> 01:46:09.110
There's the last Copperhead.

2082
01:46:12.950 --> 01:46:15.570
Santos, take out that drone!

2083
01:46:17.950 --> 01:46:19.700
Firing!

2084
01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:38.180
-Yeah!

2085
01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:38.180
-We did it!

2086
01:46:40.390 --> 01:46:41.930
We did it!

2087
01:46:42.770 --> 01:46:44.310
We did it!

2088
01:46:49.650 --> 01:46:52.530
I can't believe it worked!

2089
01:46:58.660 --> 01:47:00.370
Yeah!

2090
01:47:00.580 --> 01:47:02.200
Staff sergeant, you did it!

2091
01:47:04.500 --> 01:47:07.500
There's nothing controlling

2092
01:47:04.500 --> 01:47:07.500
the drones anymore!

2093
01:47:14.090 --> 01:47:15.930
Marines, on me!

2094
01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:30.900
They're retreating. Advance!

2095
01:48:41.550 --> 01:48:43.430
You guys saved our lives out there!

2096
01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:45.520
Semper Fi, Two-Five!

2097
01:48:45.770 --> 01:48:49.140
-All right, Two-Five!

2098
01:48:45.770 --> 01:48:49.140
-Retreat, hell!

2099
01:48:49.350 --> 01:48:52.020
You kicked ass, staff sarge!

2100
01:48:49.350 --> 01:48:52.020
Welcome home!

2101
01:48:52.940 --> 01:48:56.190
-Move! Move! Move!

2102
01:48:52.940 --> 01:48:56.190
-Good work, Marines! Outstanding.

2103
01:48:56.780 --> 01:48:58.650
Your civilians are safe.

2104
01:48:58.860 --> 01:49:01.450
Word of how you brought

2105
01:48:58.860 --> 01:49:01.450
their ship down...

2106
01:49:01.620 --> 01:49:04.330
...is going out to every army

2107
01:49:01.620 --> 01:49:04.330
in every city.

2108
01:49:04.530 --> 01:49:08.540
We're mustering up whatever troops

2109
01:49:04.530 --> 01:49:08.540
we can get and going back in.

2110
01:49:08.790 --> 01:49:10.830
So get out of that gear.

2111
01:49:11.420 --> 01:49:12.630
Get some chow in you.

2112
01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:14.960
There's breakfast in the tent.

2113
01:49:15.170 --> 01:49:18.590
You earned it. Hoorah, Two-Five.

2114
01:50:07.060 --> 01:50:08.560
-Get some smoke, Imlay.

2115
01:50:07.060 --> 01:50:08.560
-Got you.

2116
01:50:08.770 --> 01:50:10.980
Got grenades over here.

2117
01:50:08.770 --> 01:50:10.980
Anybody need?

2118
01:50:11.180 --> 01:50:15.400
-Got frag rounds coming down.

2119
01:50:11.180 --> 01:50:15.400
-Imlay, I think you could use this.

2120
01:50:15.610 --> 01:50:18.530
-Got it. HE rounds.

2121
01:50:15.610 --> 01:50:18.530
-I need a couple more magazines.

2122
01:50:18.730 --> 01:50:20.990
-Very nice, very nice.

2123
01:50:18.730 --> 01:50:20.990
-Everybody got ammo?

2124
01:50:21.190 --> 01:50:22.650
Yes, staff sergeant.

2125
01:50:23.070 --> 01:50:25.570
What do you think you're doing,

2126
01:50:23.070 --> 01:50:25.570
staff sergeant?

2127
01:50:26.370 --> 01:50:28.620
We already had breakfast, sir.

2128
01:50:37.710 --> 01:50:39.550
I'll be borrowing this, sir.

2129
01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:41.210
Carry on.

2130
01:50:42.340 --> 01:50:44.380
-Retreat, hell!

2131
01:50:42.340 --> 01:50:44.380
-Hoorah!

2132
01:50:45.550 --> 01:50:47.550
This is Bullpen 2-3. Who's with me?

2133
01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:50.060
Morning, Bullpen.

2134
01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:50.060
Dog Pound 2-1, on your left.

2135
01:50:50.220 --> 01:50:52.270
Good to hear a friendly voice,

2136
01:50:50.220 --> 01:50:52.270
Dog Pound 2-1.

2137
01:50:52.430 --> 01:50:54.390
Liberty 1-1,

2138
01:50:52.430 --> 01:50:54.390
Snake Eyes joining the fight.

2139
01:50:54.560 --> 01:50:56.310
Yankee-Foxtrot-2-1,

2140
01:50:54.560 --> 01:50:56.310
we're on your six.

2141
01:50:56.480 --> 01:50:58.570
-Morning, Dog Pound 2-1.

2142
01:50:56.480 --> 01:50:58.570
-Eagle on your right.

2143
01:50:58.730 --> 01:51:03.030
This is Foxtrot-Two-November.

2144
01:50:58.730 --> 01:51:03.030
Let's take back Los Angeles.

2145
01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:18.430
We have five birds down

2146
01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:18.430
two klicks west of CP Victory.

2147
01:56:19.220 --> 01:56:21.930
We're hit, we're hit! Tighten

2148
01:56:19.220 --> 01:56:21.930
your asses, we're going down!

2149
01:56:22.140 --> 01:56:23.810
Command and control is down.

2150
01:56:23.970 --> 01:56:26.270
Civilians in need of support

2151
01:56:23.970 --> 01:56:26.270
two klicks northeast.

2152
01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:28.810
Cables inbound.

2153
01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:28.810
Engage your sectors of fire, over.

2154
01:56:29.310 --> 01:56:32.020
Oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit.
