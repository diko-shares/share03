1
00:00:57.444 --> 00:01:00.324
One foot and then the other.

2
00:01:03.204 --> 00:01:07.324
Rise and shine, Pittsburgh!
This is Chuey Martinez on WQQC.

3
00:01:07.404 --> 00:01:10.244
If you're up this early,
you're either out chasing a dream

4
00:01:10.324 --> 00:01:12.283
or out all night chasing something else.

5
00:01:12.364 --> 00:01:17.324
Either way, don't let one I get you down,
you can always bounce back, baby. Let's go.

6
00:02:15.844 --> 00:02:17.484
Hi, Miss Murdoch.

7
00:02:19.204 --> 00:02:21.524
Oh, shit! Bye, Miss Murdoch!

8
00:02:31.204 --> 00:02:32.924
Let's see.

9
00:02:42.044 --> 00:02:44.524
Thirty seconds slower than yesterday.

10
00:02:44.604 --> 00:02:47.644
I'm sorry. I was... I was...

11
00:02:47.724 --> 00:02:48.724
distracted.

12
00:02:53.364 --> 00:02:55.924
- Again?
- Again. Come on.

13
00:03:32.924 --> 00:03:36.604
If I could rap or something like you,
I would get all 10's.

14
00:03:36.684 --> 00:03:40.004
But, like, any girl under an eight
is right out, you know.

15
00:03:40.084 --> 00:03:42.444
I can't go below that.
I'm better than that.

16
00:03:42.524 --> 00:03:44.364
- That's interesting...
- Right?

17
00:03:44.444 --> 00:03:45.724
Guys. Guess what.

18
00:03:45.804 --> 00:03:47.124
- Is that a smoothie, man?
- Yeah.

19
00:03:47.164 --> 00:03:49.244
It's better than soda.
Nothing but empty calories.

20
00:03:49.325 --> 00:03:51.684
I liked you so much better
fat. It's not even funny.

21
00:03:51.764 --> 00:03:53.684
Yeah. Well, your mom doesn't.

22
00:03:54.684 --> 00:03:57.444
- That's gross.
- You still got fat-boy standards. Because you're fat.

23
00:03:57.524 --> 00:03:58.925
- Okay. Shut up.
- You're still fat.

24
00:03:58.964 --> 00:04:01.364
- Shut up!
- What's up, bro?

25
00:04:01.444 --> 00:04:05.043
Big Sean tweeted that he's doing
a free show in Pittsburgh tonight!

26
00:04:05.124 --> 00:04:07.124
- I wish I could believe that.
- Okay.

27
00:04:08.164 --> 00:04:10.964
- Are you serious? Why didn't you say that?
- Yeah. Well, I told you...

28
00:04:11.044 --> 00:04:12.844
I told you. We're going, right?

29
00:04:12.924 --> 00:04:16.164
- Of course. What are you talking about?
- That's tight.

30
00:04:16.244 --> 00:04:17.524
- It's not tight.
- Don't say it.

31
00:04:17.604 --> 00:04:19.324
No, no, no.

32
00:04:19.404 --> 00:04:22.564
I told my parents
I would finish my college application.

33
00:04:22.644 --> 00:04:25.164
Look, I need this, okay?

34
00:04:25.244 --> 00:04:26.524
I really need this.

35
00:04:26.604 --> 00:04:31.164
I have one year left to lose my Scarlet V and I've
struck out with every acceptable girl in this school.

36
00:04:31.244 --> 00:04:32.525
- Even Sarah?
- Even Sarah.

37
00:04:32.604 --> 00:04:33.644
Yeah.

38
00:04:33.724 --> 00:04:35.324
Get on board. I need this.

39
00:04:35.405 --> 00:04:37.365
- I have to finish my essay.
- Are you kidding me?

40
00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:40.485
- It's the last day of school, Daryn.
- They're not due until September!

41
00:04:40.564 --> 00:04:43.564
Be like Sammy. Don't go to college.
Aim for the lower middle.

42
00:04:54.205 --> 00:04:56.364
- Darling.
- Thank you, my dear.

43
00:04:59.564 --> 00:05:01.764
Well, it's a good start.

44
00:05:01.844 --> 00:05:04.164
But I do have some notes.

45
00:05:05.124 --> 00:05:07.404
Do we have to go through them right now?

46
00:05:08.484 --> 00:05:10.804
Unless there's somewhere more important
you have to be.

47
00:05:12.244 --> 00:05:13.644
No. I...

48
00:05:13.724 --> 00:05:16.604
There's just this concert
that Sammy and Kiran invited me to.

49
00:05:16.685 --> 00:05:17.764
That sounds fun.

50
00:05:18.885 --> 00:05:20.004
What kind of concert?

51
00:05:20.084 --> 00:05:23.924
It's just like a rap show. Rap concert.

52
00:05:25.764 --> 00:05:27.924
I think he deserves a night off.

53
00:05:32.684 --> 00:05:34.084
Be home by 11, son.

54
00:05:34.164 --> 00:05:36.804
- Absolutely. Love you, Mom.
- I love you.

55
00:05:38.724 --> 00:05:41.204
- I'll leave the notes on your desk.
- Cool.

56
00:05:42.164 --> 00:05:43.324
"Cool."

57
00:05:44.284 --> 00:05:46.364
All right, I see what you did there.

58
00:05:46.445 --> 00:05:49.325
- Look at all these people.
- They should be lining up to see you, Daryn.

59
00:05:49.404 --> 00:05:51.884
They would be lining up to
see you if you record something.

60
00:05:51.964 --> 00:05:55.404
- You could totally be the next Big Sean.
- Good God, look at these girls.

61
00:05:55.484 --> 00:05:58.805
- Hi.
- Hello. Hi, how are you? I'm Kiran.

62
00:05:58.884 --> 00:06:00.604
Kiran. Kiran.

63
00:06:00.684 --> 00:06:03.444
- She did not pay attention to me.
- That's it, no one else in.

64
00:06:03.524 --> 00:06:05.684
God, we should've come two hours ago.

65
00:06:05.764 --> 00:06:08.604
- We'll never get in.
- If I don't get in, I don't get groupies.

66
00:06:08.685 --> 00:06:10.605
You won't anyway, what's the difference?

67
00:06:10.684 --> 00:06:11.604
- Shut up.
- You shut up.

68
00:06:11.685 --> 00:06:13.844
- It's gonna happen.
- Yo, yo.

69
00:06:13.924 --> 00:06:16.765
- Follow me. I got a plan. I got an idea.
- Follow you where?

70
00:06:16.844 --> 00:06:18.724
Daryn. Daryn! Where...?

71
00:06:19.684 --> 00:06:22.764
- Sorry. What are you doing?
- Get in here. Come. On.

72
00:06:22.844 --> 00:06:24.804
- This is how horror movies start.
- Be cool.

73
00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:28.444
- Just keep your cool.
- Daryn, let's just go back.

74
00:06:28.524 --> 00:06:30.444
- Daryn.
- Chill. Chill. Chill.

75
00:06:35.285 --> 00:06:38.524
- It's all right. Okay.
- Okay.

76
00:06:38.604 --> 00:06:40.684
Daryn, I don't think...

77
00:06:40.765 --> 00:06:42.005
- No.
- This is fate.

78
00:06:42.084 --> 00:06:44.724
This is fate. Let's go. You ready?
You wanna see Big Sean.

79
00:06:44.804 --> 00:06:47.124
Who's trying to talk me into it?
You not gonna go?

80
00:06:47.205 --> 00:06:49.365
- Yeah. Let's go. Let's go.
- Make it bigger for Sammy.

81
00:06:49.405 --> 00:06:52.285
- Let's go.
- I'm not fat anymore. Asshole.

82
00:06:52.364 --> 00:06:54.765
- Oh, thanks for the help.
- Oh, man. Sorry.

83
00:06:54.844 --> 00:06:57.604
Okay. All right.

84
00:06:59.644 --> 00:07:02.044
- All right.
- Oh, I got it. I got it.

85
00:07:04.284 --> 00:07:05.404
Ready?

86
00:07:07.724 --> 00:07:10.604
- You've done this before, huh?
- Shut up.

87
00:07:14.444 --> 00:07:15.444
Yo!

88
00:07:16.884 --> 00:07:20.005
- Who are you?
- Daryn.

89
00:07:20.084 --> 00:07:23.924
I'm Daryn.
Are you, like, with the tour or something?

90
00:07:24.004 --> 00:07:26.445
Duh. Now piss off, square.

91
00:07:26.524 --> 00:07:30.524
Well, just a second
because my friend here has a head injury!

92
00:07:30.604 --> 00:07:31.404
Wait. What?

93
00:07:31.484 --> 00:07:34.805
His mom dropped him when he was very young,
and ever since he has as a condition

94
00:07:34.884 --> 00:07:38.645
to where he can't see things
unless he's on top of other things.

95
00:07:38.724 --> 00:07:41.245
Perfect example, this
thing that you're on top of,

96
00:07:41.324 --> 00:07:46.004
we'd love to watch the show with
you up there for medical reasons.

97
00:07:46.084 --> 00:07:47.204
Right.

98
00:07:49.004 --> 00:07:53.404
- Oh, yeah. I can't see a damn thing!
- You know what I'm saying?

99
00:07:53.484 --> 00:07:56.724
- I am freaking out right now, man!
- You know what I mean?

100
00:07:56.804 --> 00:07:59.324
- I don't know where I am, Daryn.
- Calm down. Do you see this?

101
00:07:59.404 --> 00:08:01.164
- I need to get inside!
- Come on.

102
00:08:01.244 --> 00:08:05.324
- The darkness scares me, Daryn.
- Over here. Over here. Can you help us?

103
00:08:05.405 --> 00:08:06.485
Fifty bucks. Each.

104
00:08:06.564 --> 00:08:10.725
Each? We're paying for his medication
and all, we don't have that money.

105
00:08:10.804 --> 00:08:13.244
Nice try, square. You're wearing loafers.

106
00:08:13.325 --> 00:08:16.523
So either you have money
or you jacked someone who did.

107
00:08:16.604 --> 00:08:18.364
I'm pretty sure it's the first.

108
00:08:18.444 --> 00:08:20.325
Damn it, Daryn.

109
00:08:20.404 --> 00:08:25.884
- All right. How about this, 60 for all of us?
- All right. Show me the paper.

110
00:08:25.965 --> 00:08:27.605
- Deal. Now, you can see...
- Hey!

111
00:08:27.684 --> 00:08:28.685
What...?

112
00:08:28.764 --> 00:08:32.565
- You kids can't be back here.
- Okay. Cool. She said it was fine.

113
00:08:32.644 --> 00:08:33.925
And who is she?

114
00:08:34.004 --> 00:08:36.684
Yeah. What is...? Yeah.
What is your name?

115
00:08:36.764 --> 00:08:40.044
Wait. Is somebody up there?
You can't be up there!

116
00:08:40.124 --> 00:08:44.205
Yeah? Well, I'd like to see you Spider-Man your Hulk
ass up here and do something about it, all right?

117
00:08:44.284 --> 00:08:45.924
- What?
- Yeah.

118
00:08:46.005 --> 00:08:47.564
- Oh, shit!
- Come back here.

119
00:08:47.645 --> 00:08:49.165
You're in for it now!

120
00:08:50.204 --> 00:08:52.565
- Hey. Hey, man. Leave her alone.
- Hands off, kid!

121
00:08:52.644 --> 00:08:53.644
Hey. Hey!

122
00:08:53.685 --> 00:08:55.325
Okay.

123
00:08:58.725 --> 00:09:01.924
Hey, it's cool, man. I used to be fat too.
So we're basically like brothers.

124
00:09:02.004 --> 00:09:03.004
Hey!

125
00:09:04.085 --> 00:09:06.044
Oh, my God. You just punched him!

126
00:09:07.324 --> 00:09:09.165
- Oh, you suck at punching, Daryn!
- My turn.

127
00:09:09.244 --> 00:09:10.364
Up here, big head!

128
00:09:12.165 --> 00:09:13.764
- Oh, my goodness.
- Oh, shit.

129
00:09:13.845 --> 00:09:16.045
Did she just kill him? We're going to jail.

130
00:09:16.124 --> 00:09:18.324
- I don't like blood.
- Yo, hey!

131
00:09:18.404 --> 00:09:20.565
Hey! Hey! Wait!

132
00:09:22.684 --> 00:09:23.685
What's your name?

133
00:09:25.004 --> 00:09:26.165
Isabelle!

134
00:09:26.244 --> 00:09:28.925
- Isabelle.
- Daryn? Oh, shit.

135
00:09:30.165 --> 00:09:33.045
- Daryn.
- You're all dead!

136
00:09:33.124 --> 00:09:35.205
- Shit.
- We're going to hell!

137
00:09:35.284 --> 00:09:36.924
- Daryn!
- Oh, shit!

138
00:09:37.005 --> 00:09:39.164
- Hey! Isabelle!
- Daryn, where are we going?

139
00:09:39.244 --> 00:09:43.124
- Isabelle! Isabelle!
- Come here!

140
00:09:43.205 --> 00:09:45.844
- Go away!
- You're a track star, run faster!

141
00:09:45.925 --> 00:09:47.725
Holy shit!

142
00:11:32.365 --> 00:11:33.485
Yo!

143
00:11:33.565 --> 00:11:35.365
Bro, what's so clutch we had to rush here?

144
00:11:35.444 --> 00:11:37.045
Yeah, Daryn, I shouldn't be here.

145
00:11:37.125 --> 00:11:39.004
Me and this place got
some bad memories, so...

146
00:11:39.085 --> 00:11:40.205
Yeah. I get that.

147
00:11:40.285 --> 00:11:43.205
But I need you guys to just take a
look inside because I need some help.

148
00:11:43.284 --> 00:11:45.844
I know what's inside
because I came here every day after school.

149
00:11:45.925 --> 00:11:48.324
I didn't bring you here
to see what flavor ice cream I want.

150
00:11:48.405 --> 00:11:51.204
There's something in here
that I really need you to see.

151
00:11:53.725 --> 00:11:56.085
- Shit!
- You see?

152
00:11:56.164 --> 00:11:58.604
- You see? Yes.
- The scary girl from the concert. So what?

153
00:11:58.685 --> 00:12:00.725
Yes.

154
00:12:00.804 --> 00:12:02.484
- You like her.
- I mean, No, no, no.

155
00:12:02.565 --> 00:12:05.126
- You like her.
- No, no. It's not like that. It's not like that.

156
00:12:05.204 --> 00:12:08.125
- Even if I did, do you think she likes me?
- No. She doesn't like you.

157
00:12:08.204 --> 00:12:09.965
- Can we go, please?
- Yo, look.

158
00:12:10.045 --> 00:12:13.284
In my 17 years of living, no girl has
ever liked me. Doesn't stop me from trying.

159
00:12:13.365 --> 00:12:14.485
- Right now?
- Yeah, now.

160
00:12:14.565 --> 00:12:18.125
- I'm still in my clothes...
- It doesn't matter. You look good.

161
00:12:18.204 --> 00:12:20.205
It's all good. You're good, baby.

162
00:12:20.284 --> 00:12:22.525
Hey, maybe it's okay
if I just get like a small cone.

163
00:12:22.604 --> 00:12:25.685
But no hot fudge.
Maybe some hot fudge, but no jimmies.

164
00:12:25.764 --> 00:12:27.605
Once a fat kid, always a fat kid.

165
00:12:27.684 --> 00:12:31.404
Welcome to The Big Chill.
What frozen moo juice do you guys want?

166
00:12:32.965 --> 00:12:34.885
- You know...
- Wait a minute.

167
00:12:36.204 --> 00:12:39.644
I know you. You're that
square that owes me 60 bucks.

168
00:12:41.925 --> 00:12:44.805
Yes. I remember, from the concert.

169
00:12:44.885 --> 00:12:48.244
That's crazy that we're running
into each other. I'm Daryn.

170
00:12:48.325 --> 00:12:50.005
Great to see you. Great to see you...

171
00:12:50.085 --> 00:12:53.725
You know what, how's it going? I
think we'll take three small vanilla cones.

172
00:12:53.805 --> 00:12:56.325
One with jimmies and hot fudge, please.

173
00:12:56.405 --> 00:12:59.005
- Do you want any whipped cream with that?
- Yes.

174
00:12:59.084 --> 00:13:01.525
Seven dollars and twenty-three cents.

175
00:13:01.605 --> 00:13:02.404
Thank you.

176
00:13:02.485 --> 00:13:04.884
And $2.77 makes 10.

177
00:13:05.844 --> 00:13:07.884
- Alrighty.
- Don't!

178
00:13:07.965 --> 00:13:11.765
Just don't tip me, okay? If you
tip me I have to sing. So don't.

179
00:13:13.244 --> 00:13:14.884
Well, I gotta hear that.

180
00:13:15.885 --> 00:13:19.124
We got a tip, everybody!

181
00:13:22.885 --> 00:13:24.204
Five, six, seven...

182
00:13:51.364 --> 00:13:53.605
- Wow, that was amazing.
- So good.

183
00:13:53.684 --> 00:13:56.485
Okay. Have a good day, sir. Goodbye!

184
00:14:00.124 --> 00:14:01.165
- Really?
- Sorry.

185
00:14:01.244 --> 00:14:03.885
- I just... It was too good.
- From the top, people!

186
00:14:03.964 --> 00:14:05.685
I'm going on a break.

187
00:14:08.285 --> 00:14:10.125
Wait, wait, wait.

188
00:14:10.205 --> 00:14:12.525
It seems like I made you mad
That's not what I wanna do.

189
00:14:12.604 --> 00:14:15.165
'Cause, baby, me and you
Could go together like a double scoop.

190
00:14:15.245 --> 00:14:16.845
Your green eyes
I'm hypnotized

191
00:14:16.925 --> 00:14:19.565
I need a lemon lime ice cream
I emphasize

192
00:14:19.645 --> 00:14:20.564
I need you in my life

193
00:14:20.645 --> 00:14:23.164
I think that we could chill
And get a bite together.

194
00:14:23.245 --> 00:14:25.725
Please don't walk away
'Cause I'll be tipping you forever.

195
00:14:25.805 --> 00:14:29.445
Now that is ice cream. Yeah.

196
00:14:35.285 --> 00:14:37.765
- So...
- Hell no.

197
00:14:39.924 --> 00:14:42.885
All right. But you know what
makes me feel better after rejection?

198
00:14:42.965 --> 00:14:44.525
- More music.
- Okay, wait.

199
00:14:44.605 --> 00:14:49.045
Hold on. Okay, fine. Fine. You can...
You can walk me home after work.

200
00:14:49.125 --> 00:14:52.124
Okay. Great. That's fantastic.
Okay. I'll be here.

201
00:14:52.205 --> 00:14:53.685
What time do you get off?

202
00:14:53.764 --> 00:14:54.965
- Ten.
- Ten it is.

203
00:14:55.045 --> 00:14:56.125
It's perfect. It's a date.

204
00:14:56.205 --> 00:14:58.045
- It's not a date.
- It sounds like a date.

205
00:14:58.125 --> 00:15:00.645
That's my man right there.
I'll see you then, good times.

206
00:15:00.725 --> 00:15:02.845
- Dude, that was so sick.
- Double scoop.

207
00:15:02.925 --> 00:15:04.765
You're like James Bond.
Can you teach me that?

208
00:15:10.805 --> 00:15:13.524
- I live in Wilkinsburg.
- Yeah?

209
00:15:13.605 --> 00:15:16.485
- So...
- If you drive that in, you're limping out.

210
00:15:16.565 --> 00:15:19.365
So I guess I'm walking you home?

211
00:15:20.685 --> 00:15:22.525
Sure. Whatever.

212
00:15:29.085 --> 00:15:31.045
I like your hair.

213
00:15:34.285 --> 00:15:36.605
So, what school do you go to?

214
00:15:36.684 --> 00:15:38.484
I don't go to school.

215
00:15:38.565 --> 00:15:40.325
Isn't that, like, illegal?

216
00:15:41.285 --> 00:15:43.245
I don't know. Probably.

217
00:15:45.324 --> 00:15:47.885
- Are you...?
- Yeah. Hands off, square, all right?

218
00:15:47.965 --> 00:15:50.124
Hey, come back here. That's my pop.

219
00:15:50.205 --> 00:15:52.205
Well, I stole it! So it's mine now.

220
00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:54.365
Get back here, that's my pop. Hey!

221
00:15:54.445 --> 00:15:56.485
Izzy, hey, I got a free soda.

222
00:15:56.564 --> 00:15:58.325
- That's my pop!
- Well, it's mine now.

223
00:15:58.405 --> 00:16:02.725
- I stole it. Because you're being a discriminating dick!
- Don't you come back, you freak.

224
00:16:02.805 --> 00:16:04.365
- Hey, Izzy, baby.
- What's up, Phil?

225
00:16:04.445 --> 00:16:05.965
Who's Mr. New Sugar?

226
00:16:06.044 --> 00:16:10.685
- His name is Square.
- Hello, ma'am. Good to meet you. I'm Daryn.

227
00:16:10.765 --> 00:16:11.765
Very polite.

228
00:16:11.804 --> 00:16:15.644
And he's got all his teeth.
That's an upgrade for you, Izzy.

229
00:16:15.725 --> 00:16:18.685
Okay, you two lovebirds, I'm gonna
go to work. Leftovers in the fridge.

230
00:16:18.765 --> 00:16:21.365
- Thanks.
- Oh, and don't be too scared.

231
00:16:21.445 --> 00:16:26.565
I know how she gets but even the toughest kitty
cats purr if you know just where to pet them.

232
00:16:26.645 --> 00:16:28.005
- What was that?
- Bye-bye.

233
00:16:28.085 --> 00:16:31.084
- Phil, come on. All right. See you later.
- Bye, Izzy.

234
00:16:31.165 --> 00:16:34.844
- So... So is that your mom?
- No.

235
00:16:34.925 --> 00:16:37.805
- Okay, so dad? That's confusing.
- No?

236
00:16:39.524 --> 00:16:41.445
This is a nice place.

237
00:16:41.524 --> 00:16:43.605
It's a shit-box. I'm poor, not blind.

238
00:16:47.685 --> 00:16:52.205
So I think that, you know, I think me
and you should, like, go on a proper date.

239
00:16:52.285 --> 00:16:54.165
I don't date squares.

240
00:16:54.245 --> 00:16:58.125
Well, I think you should because
you know, we're smart, we're punctual,

241
00:16:58.205 --> 00:17:01.365
we can pay for stuff.
You can use us to draw straight lines.

242
00:17:02.725 --> 00:17:05.564
Okay, fine. But just once,
and mostly out of pity.

243
00:17:05.645 --> 00:17:09.205
Okay. Great. Saturday, here. I'll pick
you up at 7. It's a date. It will be fun.

244
00:17:09.285 --> 00:17:13.165
- It's not a date.
- Okay. Okay. Have a good night.

245
00:17:15.325 --> 00:17:18.365
In your holy and precious
name we pray. Amen.

246
00:17:18.445 --> 00:17:20.485
- Amen.
- Amen.

247
00:17:22.325 --> 00:17:24.205
I have some good news.

248
00:17:24.285 --> 00:17:27.805
The Maxwells have invited us over
to a reception on Saturday.

249
00:17:27.885 --> 00:17:31.645
David Maxwell's brother
is on the board of trustees for Harvard.

250
00:17:31.725 --> 00:17:35.245
- Nice.
- I... I actually had plans for Saturday.

251
00:17:38.805 --> 00:17:42.005
Are these plans more important
than your future, son?

252
00:17:43.485 --> 00:17:45.445
Nine o'clock sharp, Daryn.

253
00:17:47.765 --> 00:17:49.605
Nine o'clock sharp.

254
00:17:58.405 --> 00:18:00.605
What's that with the clock,
twitchy? Got a hot date?

255
00:18:01.725 --> 00:18:04.965
No. It's just this thing
that my dad is making me go to later.

256
00:18:05.045 --> 00:18:08.445
But I got an early reservation
at Creme Petite. So...

257
00:18:08.525 --> 00:18:10.325
Nice. Who you going there with?

258
00:18:11.645 --> 00:18:12.485
Well, you.

259
00:18:12.565 --> 00:18:17.445
Hi, I'm Isabelle, the girl that you think
is impressed by fancy clothes, a nice car,

260
00:18:17.525 --> 00:18:19.165
and a restaurant full of old people.

261
00:18:19.245 --> 00:18:22.765
I'm sorry. I just... I
don't know... I just...

262
00:18:22.845 --> 00:18:25.485
I've never been out with
anyone like you before.

263
00:18:25.565 --> 00:18:27.245
Meaning?

264
00:18:27.325 --> 00:18:30.805
Meaning someone that I really like.

265
00:18:33.565 --> 00:18:38.125
Oh, shit. Okay. Fine.

266
00:18:38.205 --> 00:18:41.885
Take a left at the lights.
I know a good place.

267
00:18:44.285 --> 00:18:45.165
Okay.

268
00:18:45.245 --> 00:18:46.245
Order up!

269
00:18:46.325 --> 00:18:49.325
- Is this even food?
- It's the best kind of food.

270
00:18:49.405 --> 00:18:50.685
This...

271
00:18:52.125 --> 00:18:53.645
looks like Freddy Kruger's ball sack.

272
00:18:54.725 --> 00:18:57.605
- Wow, delicious ball sack.
- You kind of catch my drift?

273
00:18:57.685 --> 00:18:59.845
Yeah.

274
00:18:59.925 --> 00:19:02.445
- Just try it, Square.
- Well, how about this? How about this?

275
00:19:02.525 --> 00:19:05.365
I'll try it if you tell me
why you don't go to school.

276
00:19:05.445 --> 00:19:06.685
Who cares?

277
00:19:06.765 --> 00:19:09.285
Don't you feel it's important
for your life? For the future?

278
00:19:09.365 --> 00:19:10.885
- What future?
- What do you mean?

279
00:19:10.965 --> 00:19:13.405
Like, scholarship, Harvard.

280
00:19:13.485 --> 00:19:16.365
Law school. Clerking.

281
00:19:16.445 --> 00:19:18.445
- You got it all planned out.
- Yeah.

282
00:19:18.525 --> 00:19:20.965
I mean, me and my dad,
we try to formulate a plan and just...

283
00:19:21.045 --> 00:19:23.405
Wait a minute. Papa Square.
That would be your rap name.

284
00:19:24.805 --> 00:19:27.445
- No. I'm not... I'm not gonna be...
- Makes you sound old.

285
00:19:27.525 --> 00:19:31.525
- Square. Son of Square.
- I'm not gonna be a rapper. It's just... It's not practical.

286
00:19:31.605 --> 00:19:32.605
Square-Squared.

287
00:19:34.845 --> 00:19:36.925
Look, you're good. I've seen you do it.

288
00:19:37.885 --> 00:19:42.205
It doesn't matter. Just between
Honor Society, Student Council, track...

289
00:19:42.285 --> 00:19:44.765
Can you hear yourself?
You're just listing off bullshit.

290
00:19:44.845 --> 00:19:46.325
It's like:

291
00:19:47.365 --> 00:19:51.125
That's not bullshit. That's my life.
I hold the state record in the 5,000 meter.

292
00:19:52.165 --> 00:19:55.605
- Is that what you really want though? Out of life?
- It's not about what I want.

293
00:19:55.685 --> 00:20:01.045
It's about identifying a goal and making and reaching
that goal, making it happen, making it a reality.

294
00:20:01.126 --> 00:20:02.325
You sound like a robot.

295
00:20:03.485 --> 00:20:08.645
Do you know how hard it is to get into
Harvard? They take less than 6 percent.

296
00:20:08.725 --> 00:20:11.845
Less than 6 percent.
That's six out of a hundred.

297
00:20:11.925 --> 00:20:15.805
Do you realize how little that is? Six
percent... Greatness requires sacrifice.

298
00:20:15.885 --> 00:20:17.885
You can't do what you
want. Do you know that?

299
00:20:17.965 --> 00:20:20.445
- Why not?
- Prison.

300
00:20:20.525 --> 00:20:23.765
Look, just because I know what I want
doesn't mean I always get it, okay?

301
00:20:23.845 --> 00:20:26.125
But at least I'm honest with
myself about what I want.

302
00:20:26.205 --> 00:20:30.845
That's why I don't go to
school, because I don't want to.

303
00:20:30.925 --> 00:20:33.605
Now dig in. It's gonna get cold.

304
00:20:33.685 --> 00:20:35.125
Come on.

305
00:20:35.205 --> 00:20:38.485
- This is just disgusting.
- In your mouth.

306
00:20:38.566 --> 00:20:39.925
Yeah?

307
00:20:42.725 --> 00:20:44.765
There you go.

308
00:20:48.285 --> 00:20:49.365
- That's good.
- Yeah.

309
00:20:49.445 --> 00:20:53.246
- That's good.
- Look, everyone! Square has joined the human race.

310
00:20:53.325 --> 00:20:54.925
Welcome to the human race, Square.

311
00:20:55.005 --> 00:20:57.405
Welcome. Welcome to the human race.

312
00:20:57.485 --> 00:21:01.005
I've been in the crew...
In the human race crew...

313
00:21:01.085 --> 00:21:02.325
What do you actually want?

314
00:21:02.405 --> 00:21:05.005
You? Not your dad, not your mom.

315
00:21:05.085 --> 00:21:06.925
What do you want?

316
00:21:11.645 --> 00:21:13.365
I wanna take you out again.

317
00:21:24.125 --> 00:21:27.845
Well, I can assure you, Mr. Maxwell,
that it's not like Daryn to be late.

318
00:21:27.925 --> 00:21:30.045
No, not at all.

319
00:21:31.245 --> 00:21:32.805
Here he is.

320
00:21:34.605 --> 00:21:37.285
- Oh, poor dear.
- I'm so sorry.

321
00:21:37.365 --> 00:21:41.125
- I'm sorry. Car troubles.
- Daryn, this is James Maxwell.

322
00:21:41.205 --> 00:21:44.725
- How are you, sir?
- Your father told me your quite an athlete.

323
00:21:44.806 --> 00:21:49.285
- Captain of the track team and his not quite yet a senior.
- Sir?

324
00:21:50.605 --> 00:21:55.005
You humiliated me, son.
Don't let it happen again.

325
00:21:55.085 --> 00:21:58.205
- I'm sorry. You were saying?
- Harvard.

326
00:21:58.285 --> 00:22:01.805
- Of course.
- Yes.

327
00:22:16.965 --> 00:22:19.405
So one more?

328
00:22:21.286 --> 00:22:22.885
One more.

329
00:22:32.765 --> 00:22:34.285
It does?

330
00:22:34.365 --> 00:22:37.045
Yes. Thank you.

331
00:22:38.765 --> 00:22:41.645
- One more?
- One more.

332
00:23:10.045 --> 00:23:11.125
One more?

333
00:23:11.206 --> 00:23:12.365
One more.

334
00:23:18.725 --> 00:23:20.605
- Hey.
- Hey, hold on a second.

335
00:23:21.885 --> 00:23:23.566
- Who is she?
- Who is who?

336
00:23:29.405 --> 00:23:30.605
She's just a girl.

337
00:23:31.685 --> 00:23:34.325
- Does this girl have a name?
- Isabelle.

338
00:23:36.166 --> 00:23:37.805
Here's the thing, son.

339
00:23:38.765 --> 00:23:41.246
School has started, which
means summer is over.

340
00:23:41.325 --> 00:23:44.485
This little fling of yours
is starting to become a real distraction.

341
00:23:45.605 --> 00:23:47.205
What does greatness require?

342
00:23:49.325 --> 00:23:52.285
- Sacrifice.
- Sacrifice, son.

343
00:23:52.366 --> 00:23:54.045
Sacrifice.

344
00:24:04.726 --> 00:24:06.486
Do you really think that was necessary?

345
00:24:06.565 --> 00:24:10.765
You didn't see her.
Believe me, a girl like this has no future.

346
00:24:10.845 --> 00:24:13.206
It's better it ended now.

347
00:24:15.445 --> 00:24:17.565
I wish my dad was a drag queen.

348
00:24:17.645 --> 00:24:19.405
Phil's cool but he's not my dad.

349
00:24:19.485 --> 00:24:23.325
- I never really knew my father.
- What about your mom?

350
00:24:23.405 --> 00:24:25.286
Well, she left when I was 6.

351
00:24:25.365 --> 00:24:28.006
Classic Wilkinsburg junkie.

352
00:24:28.085 --> 00:24:29.806
Where is she now?

353
00:24:29.885 --> 00:24:31.245
Who cares?

354
00:24:31.326 --> 00:24:34.525
Phil was babysitting and just,
you know, kept on babysitting.

355
00:24:36.565 --> 00:24:40.725
- So are you thirsty at all?
- What?

356
00:24:40.805 --> 00:24:44.486
Just because... I could just use some water
because I get thirsty.

357
00:24:46.165 --> 00:24:51.525
Okay. You can come up, but you're not,
you know, getting up in me or whatever.

358
00:24:52.485 --> 00:24:54.125
I just wanted some water.

359
00:25:06.805 --> 00:25:08.405
Don't touch anything.

360
00:25:08.486 --> 00:25:10.806
I wasn't going to.

361
00:25:27.165 --> 00:25:28.845
Here's your water.

362
00:25:30.885 --> 00:25:33.365
Yeah. It's supposed to be that color.

363
00:25:33.446 --> 00:25:35.086
Okay.

364
00:25:37.286 --> 00:25:41.526
- Wow, you really were thirsty.
- Yeah.

365
00:25:41.605 --> 00:25:43.805
So...

366
00:25:43.886 --> 00:25:45.205
you like the beach?

367
00:25:47.805 --> 00:25:49.405
Yeah, I do.

368
00:25:49.486 --> 00:25:53.085
I like to imagine that
I'm floating on the waves.

369
00:25:54.365 --> 00:25:58.566
Just laying back and letting
the whole ocean lift you up.

370
00:26:00.606 --> 00:26:03.285
It's probably the closest
I'll ever get though.

371
00:26:03.366 --> 00:26:06.086
A bunch of crappy postcards.

372
00:26:08.605 --> 00:26:13.285
- I mean, we could just go to the beach though.
- Yeah, sure.

373
00:26:13.366 --> 00:26:15.526
I'll get my bikini.

374
00:26:15.605 --> 00:26:17.365
Yeah. Yeah.

375
00:26:18.805 --> 00:26:22.526
- Yeah. No, but we could really go. Yeah.
- You're serious?

376
00:26:35.605 --> 00:26:37.565
- We shouldn't have done that.
- What's wrong?

377
00:26:37.646 --> 00:26:39.246
- Nothing.
- What do you mean, "nothing"?

378
00:26:39.286 --> 00:26:41.206
You were just kissing me, now you're not.

379
00:26:41.285 --> 00:26:44.125
- Your gonna have to leave.
- But people do things when they're dating.

380
00:26:44.206 --> 00:26:45.206
We're not dating, Daryn.

381
00:26:45.286 --> 00:26:47.405
- Then what are we doing?
- We're hanging out.

382
00:26:47.486 --> 00:26:50.845
- That's what dating is. Is there another guy?
- No.

383
00:26:50.926 --> 00:26:53.365
- You have some hidden boyfriend?
- There's not another guy.

384
00:26:53.445 --> 00:26:54.246
Do you like me?

385
00:26:54.325 --> 00:26:57.166
- We've been hanging out for two months. Do you like me?
- I don't know.

386
00:26:57.246 --> 00:26:58.886
What do you mean you don't know?

387
00:26:58.965 --> 00:27:00.845
- It's not that simple.
- Yes, it is, Izzy.

388
00:27:00.926 --> 00:27:01.926
Do you like me or not?

389
00:27:02.005 --> 00:27:04.126
- I don't like you, okay? Just leave it.
- What?

390
00:27:04.205 --> 00:27:06.846
Okay. Well, I don't
care because I love you.

391
00:27:06.925 --> 00:27:09.685
- Oh, my God. Please.
- What do you mean?

392
00:27:09.765 --> 00:27:11.165
- Okay. Please.
- I can't.

393
00:27:11.246 --> 00:27:12.446
Everywhere I look, I see you.

394
00:27:12.525 --> 00:27:16.525
Even when it's not you, I'm just chasing after
somebody. I seen green hair, I thought it was you.

395
00:27:16.606 --> 00:27:18.926
- You got to leave. Get out.
- You're telling me to leave?

396
00:27:19.005 --> 00:27:22.125
- No, I'm not gonna leave because I love you!
- Stop! Just stop!

397
00:27:22.206 --> 00:27:23.925
- Stop what? I can't what?
- You can't!

398
00:27:24.006 --> 00:27:27.645
- Daryn, stop! Please!
- I love you! I love you.

399
00:27:34.485 --> 00:27:37.085
I have a year to live, if that.

400
00:27:38.045 --> 00:27:40.446
Still love me now, Daryn?

401
00:27:40.525 --> 00:27:41.806
Still love me now?

402
00:27:41.885 --> 00:27:44.325
- We can figure something...
- There is no "we"!

403
00:27:44.406 --> 00:27:47.006
Get out of my house. Get out! Get out!

404
00:27:54.245 --> 00:27:56.125
Shit.

405
00:28:00.525 --> 00:28:01.846
You know what?

406
00:28:02.845 --> 00:28:03.926
Get up.

407
00:28:04.006 --> 00:28:05.885
Get up! Both of you. Up. Come on.

408
00:28:05.966 --> 00:28:08.245
Just do it. Trust me. Up. Come on.

409
00:28:09.565 --> 00:28:11.006
Get up.

410
00:28:11.085 --> 00:28:12.806
Scream.

411
00:28:12.885 --> 00:28:14.326
What?

412
00:28:14.405 --> 00:28:16.445
The universe is an asshole.

413
00:28:16.526 --> 00:28:19.926
They gave your girl cancer. Don't just
take it. Yell in its face. Do it right now.

414
00:28:20.005 --> 00:28:22.526
- Do it.
- Why?

415
00:28:22.605 --> 00:28:25.406
Sometimes that's all you can do, right?

416
00:28:26.366 --> 00:28:28.365
- Trust me.
- I can't. I...

417
00:28:35.485 --> 00:28:38.005
Suck this, big universe!

418
00:28:38.086 --> 00:28:40.445
- That's it. Do it.
- Come on. Try it.

419
00:28:40.526 --> 00:28:41.565
Do it.

420
00:28:42.525 --> 00:28:46.085
- I hate you, universe!
- Yeah. There it is.

421
00:28:46.166 --> 00:28:48.405
- You punk-ass-bully-bitch, universe!
- Yeah!

422
00:28:48.486 --> 00:28:50.966
- Up yours, universe!
- Why did you do that?

423
00:28:51.046 --> 00:28:54.766
- Terrible universe!
- You suck! You suck so much!

424
00:28:54.845 --> 00:28:56.806
Seventeen years! Still a virgin!

425
00:28:56.885 --> 00:29:00.085
I'm still humping a pumpkin!
And you give him everything that he wants!

426
00:29:00.166 --> 00:29:03.925
Goddamn white Kevin-Hart-looking
piece of shit. And I can't get anything?

427
00:29:04.006 --> 00:29:07.325
I'm shaving all this shit trying
to be pretty for y'all and it's still...

428
00:29:07.406 --> 00:29:08.766
- Kiran!
- It's not...

429
00:29:09.726 --> 00:29:11.165
What are you doing?

430
00:29:12.726 --> 00:29:17.566
- No. Yeah, I know. I just felt like...
- "Shaving my shit." What was that?

431
00:29:17.645 --> 00:29:19.606
You really shave that shit?

432
00:29:19.685 --> 00:29:21.725
- Yeah. Every other week.
- Why?

433
00:29:21.806 --> 00:29:23.805
- Because my mom says that it adds...
- Your mom?

434
00:29:23.886 --> 00:29:25.382
- Did you just say your...? Dude.
- No.

435
00:29:25.406 --> 00:29:28.287
- You have this weird relationship with your mom.
- We're not that close.

436
00:29:39.046 --> 00:29:40.645
Nothing from Harvard yet.

437
00:29:40.726 --> 00:29:43.805
It's still too early but you never know.

438
00:29:44.846 --> 00:29:46.366
You're gonna get in, son.

439
00:29:46.445 --> 00:29:49.206
You're gonna get in. It's just a formality.

440
00:29:53.726 --> 00:29:55.406
I know it's not always easy,

441
00:29:55.485 --> 00:29:58.726
but nothing worthwhile ever is.

442
00:30:00.285 --> 00:30:02.846
Life can be hard, son.

443
00:30:03.806 --> 00:30:07.886
That's why we make plans. Hear me?

444
00:30:10.046 --> 00:30:12.325
That's why we make plans.

445
00:30:15.046 --> 00:30:17.526
I gotta go, Dad. Thank you.

446
00:30:24.486 --> 00:30:27.486
I love you and... Izzy!

447
00:30:27.565 --> 00:30:30.686
Izzy, I know it sounds crazy
but I love you. I'm serious.

448
00:30:30.766 --> 00:30:36.006
And I don't care if you only have a year to leave, if
it's the rest of your life then it's everything to me!

449
00:30:36.085 --> 00:30:39.286
Izzy, I have a plan. I have a plan, Izzy.

450
00:30:39.365 --> 00:30:42.846
We're gonna live our whole life, all the
milestones. Everything that we can think off.

451
00:30:42.925 --> 00:30:46.806
A full, a whole, a complete life.
All in this year. Me and you.

452
00:30:46.886 --> 00:30:50.166
Go away, Daryn, okay? I
don't believe in happy endings.

453
00:30:50.246 --> 00:30:54.086
Well, believe in me, Iz.

454
00:30:56.006 --> 00:31:00.566
I'm serious about this, Izzy.
I think this is a really, really good idea.

455
00:31:00.646 --> 00:31:03.526
It's gonna be like freaking Disneyland.

456
00:31:03.606 --> 00:31:06.846
I don't even know what
that means. And I'm...

457
00:31:06.925 --> 00:31:11.086
Izzy, I know it's hard to believe
but I love you. I'm dead serious and...

458
00:31:13.085 --> 00:31:14.126
One condition.

459
00:31:14.205 --> 00:31:15.565
Anything.

460
00:31:15.646 --> 00:31:18.086
You have to stop saying I love you.

461
00:31:18.165 --> 00:31:21.646
Everybody thinks they're in
love until they're not. It's not real.

462
00:31:22.606 --> 00:31:24.726
There's just people that
aren't the worst right now.

463
00:31:26.486 --> 00:31:27.526
Do we have a deal?

464
00:31:29.606 --> 00:31:30.606
Deal.

465
00:31:37.286 --> 00:31:40.326
- What was that?
- First milestone.

466
00:31:56.845 --> 00:31:58.006
All right, guys.

467
00:31:58.085 --> 00:32:01.006
- Come on, Nacho.
- Milestones are complete.

468
00:32:03.086 --> 00:32:04.086
MILESTONES

469
00:32:04.125 --> 00:32:05.566
Very OCD of you, Daryn.

470
00:32:05.645 --> 00:32:09.605
I still say running the
old A-train is a milestone.

471
00:32:10.606 --> 00:32:12.046
Why is the ass hairy?

472
00:32:12.126 --> 00:32:15.326
Look, this is my attic, okay?
I'll draw the ass how I want to.

473
00:32:15.406 --> 00:32:17.846
- You want the ass to be hairy?
- It's not hairy. It's like...

474
00:32:17.886 --> 00:32:20.326
- Then what is that?
- Guys, guys! Cool? Yeah?

475
00:32:20.406 --> 00:32:22.006
- Sorry.
- This is the whole plan.

476
00:32:22.085 --> 00:32:25.645
So, what we're gonna do is we're gonna plot
these milestones throughout the whole year.

477
00:32:25.726 --> 00:32:27.725
All right. All right. What's first?

478
00:32:32.365 --> 00:32:34.086
Lovebirds needs a nest.

479
00:32:34.165 --> 00:32:37.406
- Yeah. That feels like a just-Daryn thing.
- Yeah.

480
00:32:37.486 --> 00:32:39.365
Have fun, buddy.

481
00:32:39.446 --> 00:32:45.646
The neo-brutalist foundation is accentuated
by finishes in maple, marble, granite, glass,

482
00:32:45.726 --> 00:32:47.926
and, of course, brushed aluminum.

483
00:32:48.005 --> 00:32:52.086
Does anyone have any questions
at this point? What is it now?

484
00:32:52.166 --> 00:32:56.886
Darling, do you know how many Indian
burial grounds this house is built upon?

485
00:32:56.965 --> 00:32:59.366
None. There's no burial grounds here.

486
00:32:59.446 --> 00:33:02.126
- Bullocks! Blasphemy!
- Big bullocks!

487
00:33:02.206 --> 00:33:04.126
Okay. Stop it. Stop. You're not British.

488
00:33:04.205 --> 00:33:05.926
- I'm so British.
- Slander!

489
00:33:06.006 --> 00:33:08.925
I have half a mind to report you
to the bumbershoots!

490
00:33:09.005 --> 00:33:10.966
A bumbershoot is an umbrella.

491
00:33:11.044 --> 00:33:15.126
Okay. Look, you've had your fun. Now it's time
to run along, okay? Go home to your parents.

492
00:33:15.206 --> 00:33:18.325
Maybe you're right Maybe we
are just kids playing make-believe.

493
00:33:18.406 --> 00:33:19.205
Maybe?

494
00:33:19.285 --> 00:33:23.086
Or maybe this kid here
just sold 2 million albums

495
00:33:23.165 --> 00:33:26.406
and finished a world
tour opening for Big Sean.

496
00:33:26.486 --> 00:33:30.005
Maybe Rolling Stone
called him the voice of a generation

497
00:33:30.086 --> 00:33:32.566
and Kanye is about to
drop on his next single.

498
00:33:32.646 --> 00:33:36.366
And maybe when he gets on that mic,

499
00:33:36.446 --> 00:33:39.406
minds are blown and panties are thrown.

500
00:33:39.486 --> 00:33:44.726
Ladies and gentleman, D-Square.
Come on. Give them a taste.

501
00:33:45.766 --> 00:33:49.286
- Taste of what?
- Your skills.

502
00:33:56.966 --> 00:33:58.046
Or maybe...

503
00:33:58.126 --> 00:33:59.366
Run!

504
00:34:01.046 --> 00:34:04.566
- To the bumbershoots!
- Bumbershoots!

505
00:34:04.646 --> 00:34:06.566
Every open house, huh?

506
00:34:09.485 --> 00:34:11.886
Oh, that was good.

507
00:34:14.285 --> 00:34:15.846
Major flaw.

508
00:34:18.766 --> 00:34:21.005
- This was you. You messed up.
- This was you.

509
00:34:26.646 --> 00:34:29.806
I'm almost positive November comes
before December. Who put this shit up here?

510
00:34:31.166 --> 00:34:32.166
All right.

511
00:34:34.406 --> 00:34:36.806
So watch this one. Boom, there it is.

512
00:34:36.886 --> 00:34:39.766
Start the engine. Turn. Turn.

513
00:34:39.846 --> 00:34:42.966
- Okay. I'm taking my hands off the wheel.
- No!

514
00:34:43.046 --> 00:34:45.166
Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.

515
00:34:45.246 --> 00:34:48.246
- Excuse me. Oh, sorry, sir.
- This is a hospital.

516
00:34:50.446 --> 00:34:53.166
- Thank you.
- I'll be back in a bit.

517
00:34:56.766 --> 00:34:58.526
Does that hurt?

518
00:35:00.086 --> 00:35:02.206
I'm getting used to it.

519
00:35:03.726 --> 00:35:07.846
So this joker over here,
that's Sleepy Simon.

520
00:35:07.926 --> 00:35:12.006
He thinks prostate cancer
is worse than ovarian cancer.

521
00:35:12.086 --> 00:35:14.886
We've got a pretty hefty bet
who's gonna kick it first.

522
00:35:14.966 --> 00:35:18.166
He thinks he's got it in the bag
but I'm feeling pretty lucky.

523
00:35:18.246 --> 00:35:21.966
Stop saying stuff like
that, Izzy. You're fine.

524
00:35:22.046 --> 00:35:25.766
- Are you still gonna like me when I look like that?
- No.

525
00:35:26.726 --> 00:35:28.806
- No?
- No.

526
00:35:28.886 --> 00:35:30.726
You're never gonna look like that.

527
00:35:30.806 --> 00:35:34.686
- You're a 10, baby. But that's a 12 over there.
- Lucky bastard.

528
00:35:42.886 --> 00:35:44.366
Tina Tuna.

529
00:35:44.446 --> 00:35:47.166
- Salmon L. Jackson.
- Good Gill Hunting.

530
00:35:47.246 --> 00:35:50.286
- For Cod sake. It doesn't matter what you call him.
- Okay. That was good.

531
00:35:50.366 --> 00:35:52.486
It's a Wilkinsburg fish.
He'll be dead in an hour.

532
00:35:52.566 --> 00:35:55.886
No. No. Not true. Just need some vitamins.
Maybe some fish oils.

533
00:35:55.966 --> 00:35:59.686
- Your place is this way.
- Come on. We're making a stop.

534
00:35:59.766 --> 00:36:02.566
- To where?
- Just come with me.

535
00:36:03.246 --> 00:36:04.366
Open up!

536
00:36:05.326 --> 00:36:08.006
- Are those bullet holes?
- Probably.

537
00:36:15.886 --> 00:36:18.326
Don't be knocking on
my door like the police.

538
00:36:21.006 --> 00:36:24.486
- What's up, Ron? Ron, this is Daryn.
- What up, Iz?

539
00:36:24.566 --> 00:36:26.486
- Daryn, this is Ron.
- How are you, sir?

540
00:36:26.566 --> 00:36:29.126
- Great to meet you.
- Your fish is dead, kid.

541
00:36:30.126 --> 00:36:34.606
- What did I tell you? Come on.
- Izzy. Izzy, what are we even doing here?

542
00:36:34.686 --> 00:36:36.326
Buying crack.

543
00:36:38.086 --> 00:36:40.606
Okay, Daryn, welcome home.

544
00:36:41.566 --> 00:36:42.646
Cool, right?

545
00:36:42.726 --> 00:36:46.286
This is insane. I was not
expecting this to be down here.

546
00:36:46.366 --> 00:36:47.366
That's the idea.

547
00:36:47.446 --> 00:36:50.886
Dopeheads find out about all this, they'd
be here like roaches in a cereal box.

548
00:36:50.966 --> 00:36:53.206
- Shit.
- Ron used to be a big deal.

549
00:36:53.286 --> 00:36:55.726
A long, long, long time ago.

550
00:36:55.806 --> 00:36:58.246
- That's cold, Iz.
- I'm joking.

551
00:36:58.326 --> 00:37:01.166
- It's a really nice spot you've got here, Ron.
- Thank you, yo.

552
00:37:01.246 --> 00:37:03.926
That's called my booth of proof.
So let me see what you got.

553
00:37:05.126 --> 00:37:08.366
- Me?
- No, no, that goofy kid behind you.

554
00:37:09.846 --> 00:37:11.286
No.

555
00:37:14.966 --> 00:37:20.206
No, like, I don't, like... I don't make
music. Like, I never been in one of this...

556
00:37:20.286 --> 00:37:22.286
In a recording space before.

557
00:37:22.366 --> 00:37:25.046
- Don't look so nervous. Get in.
- I don't rap.

558
00:37:25.126 --> 00:37:28.286
- He's kidding. Let's go. Come on.
- I don't... Seriously. No, no. I don't...

559
00:37:28.366 --> 00:37:30.687
- Come on, let's go. Hurry up.
- Izzy, I just... All right.

560
00:37:30.766 --> 00:37:34.166
Dude, you're wasting time.
Stop talking. Start rapping. Go.

561
00:37:35.406 --> 00:37:36.727
Just don't choke, okay?

562
00:37:36.806 --> 00:37:38.326
I'm kidding.

563
00:37:39.686 --> 00:37:43.326
- Shark Tank starts in 20. Let's get it.
- Okay.

564
00:37:45.326 --> 00:37:47.326
Yeah. Okay.

565
00:38:05.766 --> 00:38:08.966
Hey, yo, when the beat drops,
you start spitting, all right?

566
00:38:09.046 --> 00:38:13.246
Okay, cool. What is the drop that
you're referring to? What does that mean?

567
00:38:15.846 --> 00:38:19.006
- I'll count you in right here.
- Okay.

568
00:38:20.006 --> 00:38:23.006
- Spit.
- This is the beat dropping? It just happened?

569
00:38:23.087 --> 00:38:24.686
- Right there? Okay.
- Yeah, yo.

570
00:38:24.766 --> 00:38:28.326
- That's where I'm supposed to be rapping, right?
- Just do you.

571
00:38:28.406 --> 00:38:30.046
- Okay?
- Don't touch my button.

572
00:38:30.126 --> 00:38:32.526
- I know. You get sensitive...
- Let me...

573
00:38:32.606 --> 00:38:36.166
You're right. Just do
me. Just do me. All right.

574
00:38:36.247 --> 00:38:37.686
Here it comes again.

575
00:38:38.926 --> 00:38:41.766
Yo, titties in my face
Drop a hundred million on a chain.

576
00:38:41.846 --> 00:38:44.207
Strippers in the back
Of the whip like that.

577
00:38:44.286 --> 00:38:48.206
Grab 100K in my Winnie the Pooh blanket
Had a sad time, then I'm drinking

578
00:38:48.286 --> 00:38:50.606
I got cash
Hella cash

579
00:38:50.686 --> 00:38:52.446
I'm in a Rolls-Royce.

580
00:38:53.807 --> 00:38:55.086
I thought you said he was good.

581
00:38:55.167 --> 00:38:58.526
Now I got a hundred dollar...
Had to do it like a kind of sin

582
00:38:58.607 --> 00:39:00.326
I turned 10
It's a young boys school...

583
00:39:00.406 --> 00:39:01.686
What are you doing?

584
00:39:01.767 --> 00:39:04.126
You're embarrassing me
with weird wannabe-ass titty rap.

585
00:39:04.206 --> 00:39:06.806
I don't even know where I am.
I don't even wanna be in here.

586
00:39:06.886 --> 00:39:09.167
- This is where you wanna be.
- You're embarrassing me.

587
00:39:09.246 --> 00:39:13.086
- I'll let y'all figure it out while I get a beer.
- Dude, sit down!

588
00:39:13.166 --> 00:39:17.486
And you, say something! You're wasting my time! Or
is this not part of your perfectly created plan?

589
00:39:17.566 --> 00:39:20.127
No, this is not part of the plan, come on.

590
00:39:20.206 --> 00:39:24.046
Ron, did you know that Daryn has a plan?
Him and his daddy have it all figured out.

591
00:39:24.127 --> 00:39:27.407
He's gonna go to Harvard
because that's what his daddy wants.

592
00:39:27.486 --> 00:39:29.806
You know what? They only take 6 percent.

593
00:39:29.887 --> 00:39:32.006
- Six percent, seems crazy.
- Yeah, it's crazy.

594
00:39:32.086 --> 00:39:35.726
Couldn't believe it's that easy.
I wish my odds were that good.

595
00:39:35.806 --> 00:39:39.887
But they're not. I don't
have a future. My odds suck!

596
00:39:39.966 --> 00:39:42.446
But I get it. This is hard, right?

597
00:39:42.526 --> 00:39:47.046
But running, that's easy for you. You're good at
that. You got the state record and everything.

598
00:39:47.126 --> 00:39:51.526
So you know what? Run home, Daddy's boy,
because I haven't got time for this shit.

599
00:39:52.846 --> 00:39:54.086
See you later, Ron. I'm sorry.

600
00:39:56.846 --> 00:39:59.166
- Iz.
- What you know about my life, huh?

601
00:39:59.246 --> 00:40:00.646
- Nothing!
- Iz.

602
00:40:01.606 --> 00:40:05.166
What you know about the 5 a.m. running
before the sun up? Nothing!

603
00:40:05.247 --> 00:40:06.886
How you dare disrespect me?

604
00:40:06.966 --> 00:40:09.566
5k record holder
Captain of the track.

605
00:40:09.647 --> 00:40:11.447
City on my shoulder
Thought I told you

606
00:40:11.526 --> 00:40:13.767
I'm the illest and the fastest
These jokers trash.

607
00:40:13.846 --> 00:40:16.647
And they moving slower than molasses
I'm about to pass them

608
00:40:16.726 --> 00:40:17.887
I'm taking off like a rocket.

609
00:40:17.966 --> 00:40:20.207
But please, don't worry, baby girl
'Cause I got this.

610
00:40:20.286 --> 00:40:22.687
Yo
Man, I got this.

611
00:40:22.766 --> 00:40:24.686
You should worry about your life
Man, I got this.

612
00:40:24.766 --> 00:40:27.366
How you expected to survive?
Man, I got this

613
00:40:27.446 --> 00:40:29.366
I'm your guy
And you know that I got this.

614
00:40:30.846 --> 00:40:32.127
Oh, my God.

615
00:40:35.007 --> 00:40:36.567
I can't believe
What I finally achieved.

616
00:40:36.646 --> 00:40:38.807
Man, you got me in a stu
I don't think I'll ever leave.

617
00:40:38.886 --> 00:40:41.526
Man, my heart is racing
You can see my pulse through my sleeve.

618
00:40:41.607 --> 00:40:43.486
The flow is biblical
Now I'm parting the sea.

619
00:40:43.566 --> 00:40:45.486
Jeez
Now I think I'm starting to see.

620
00:40:45.567 --> 00:40:48.086
Man, I need to shake off Harvard
Get my heart in the street.

621
00:40:48.166 --> 00:40:50.127
But that isn't the man
I was brought up to be

622
00:40:50.206 --> 00:40:52.486
I'm thinking about my father
It gets harder to breathe.

623
00:40:52.567 --> 00:40:55.206
Like, wait
Do I got this?

624
00:40:55.286 --> 00:40:57.446
Man, I'm worried about my life
Do I got this?

625
00:40:57.527 --> 00:40:59.526
How am I expected to survive?
Do I got this?

626
00:40:59.606 --> 00:41:01.606
Now I'm tripping
Because I don't think I got this.

627
00:41:01.686 --> 00:41:03.446
If being a son is a job
You should fire me

628
00:41:03.526 --> 00:41:06.287
I'm sick of buying ties and competing with
Ivy-League Honor roll kids.

629
00:41:06.366 --> 00:41:08.686
Trying to make it high society
My life is a marathon.

630
00:41:08.767 --> 00:41:11.206
It don't have no privacy
From the ghost of my father's shadow

631
00:41:11.286 --> 00:41:12.846
I hope in my life
I could take it far

632
00:41:12.926 --> 00:41:15.286
I know I care
My baby girl got me drawn in.

633
00:41:15.366 --> 00:41:17.407
The boy is sick
You got a towel, then throw it in

634
00:41:17.486 --> 00:41:19.566
Ron looking at my face
Like, "We need more of this".

635
00:41:19.646 --> 00:41:22.166
Damn, why can't you let me be
Who I wanna be?

636
00:41:22.246 --> 00:41:24.046
Life is love
My love is right in front of me.

637
00:41:24.127 --> 00:41:26.047
You made me so passive
And this is my reaction.

638
00:41:26.126 --> 00:41:29.926
When you only pay attention to goals
That's what happens, yo.

639
00:41:30.007 --> 00:41:30.806
Man, I got this.

640
00:41:30.886 --> 00:41:33.126
You should worry about your life
Man, I got this.

641
00:41:33.206 --> 00:41:35.686
How you expected to survive?
Man, I got this.

642
00:41:35.767 --> 00:41:38.606
Are you gonna buy a ride?
Man, I got this, yo

643
00:41:38.686 --> 00:41:40.086
Isabelle, I got this.

644
00:41:40.167 --> 00:41:42.006
We got our whole life
No watches.

645
00:41:42.087 --> 00:41:44.486
Now we about to fly a plane
In a cockpit

646
00:41:44.567 --> 00:41:47.406
I'm your guy
And you know that I got this, yo.

647
00:41:47.486 --> 00:41:50.167
Oh, my God.

648
00:41:50.246 --> 00:41:52.527
I got this. Oh, man.

649
00:41:52.606 --> 00:41:53.767
I got this!

650
00:41:53.846 --> 00:41:56.806
- I got this!
- Here it is, here it is, here it is.

651
00:41:58.127 --> 00:42:00.207
- I'm proud of you, Square.
- Congratulations.

652
00:42:00.286 --> 00:42:01.366
Oh, my goodness.

653
00:42:02.687 --> 00:42:07.526
Do you have, like, an iCloud account
or, like, a thumb drive or something?

654
00:42:07.607 --> 00:42:11.727
- Dude, clouds are for cupids, man.
- What's that mean?

655
00:42:11.806 --> 00:42:14.686
Look, if you want folks to feel your music,
you gotta feel it first.

656
00:42:14.766 --> 00:42:18.567
You know what I mean? You
gotta touch it, feel it, smell it. Okay?

657
00:42:19.527 --> 00:42:20.806
Yeah, I like it.

658
00:42:20.887 --> 00:42:22.486
Thank you. Thank you.

659
00:42:22.567 --> 00:42:25.886
- I'm gonna get back to my shark tank.
- I really appreciate this, bro. I really...

660
00:42:25.967 --> 00:42:29.687
Whoa, industry rule 489. Hip-hoppers,
we don't hug. We just hit it right here.

661
00:42:29.766 --> 00:42:31.207
- Okay. Bump. There it is.
- Bump.

662
00:42:31.286 --> 00:42:33.446
Ron doesn't like touching, okay?

663
00:42:33.527 --> 00:42:35.406
- See you later.
- See you next time, bro.

664
00:42:48.526 --> 00:42:50.566
Oh, shit.

665
00:43:00.407 --> 00:43:03.046
How many people do you think drowned here?

666
00:43:04.647 --> 00:43:06.727
I say, around 3,000.

667
00:43:06.806 --> 00:43:08.446
Mostly witches though.

668
00:43:08.526 --> 00:43:11.446
Yeah, it's definitely creepy.

669
00:43:14.326 --> 00:43:16.047
- What's up, Square? What's wrong?
- Okay.

670
00:43:16.126 --> 00:43:20.047
- Okay. Sit down. What's going on?
- Okay. Okay.

671
00:43:22.367 --> 00:43:24.886
- Isabelle...
- Oh, shit.

672
00:43:26.327 --> 00:43:27.606
Will you marry me?

673
00:43:29.246 --> 00:43:35.046
Are you really asking me to marry you
or is this just another milestone?

674
00:43:35.127 --> 00:43:36.566
Well, this is...

675
00:43:37.847 --> 00:43:40.686
- Yes. I'm asking you...
- How's Friday?

676
00:43:41.687 --> 00:43:44.646
- Wow, yeah, this is beautiful.
- This Friday?

677
00:43:45.726 --> 00:43:50.246
Yeah, you're right. That's too far away. We
should do it tomorrow, right? That's a great idea.

678
00:43:50.327 --> 00:43:52.726
- Okay, yeah, that's...
- Yeah, I can see it now.

679
00:43:52.807 --> 00:43:56.326
Everyone in black tie, except
me, of course. I'll be in white.

680
00:43:56.406 --> 00:44:00.727
Bright, bright white, just like our cake,
which will be shaped like our love.

681
00:44:00.806 --> 00:44:05.967
We'll have a perfect fairy-tale wedding. And
we'll go on our honeymoon, to Niagara Falls.

682
00:44:06.046 --> 00:44:08.806
We'll get a suite and a heart-shaped bed.

683
00:44:08.886 --> 00:44:11.967
And then, we'll get to work
making babies, am I right?

684
00:44:12.046 --> 00:44:15.807
We need a shit-ton of babies
if I'm gonna have a happily ever after.

685
00:44:17.406 --> 00:44:22.127
Except I can't have a happily ever after.

686
00:44:24.686 --> 00:44:26.367
Don't you get it?

687
00:44:34.087 --> 00:44:37.247
What...? What is going on?

688
00:44:38.207 --> 00:44:40.206
What have you done now?

689
00:44:45.646 --> 00:44:49.327
Oh, guys. Oh, my God.

690
00:44:52.047 --> 00:44:55.846
I'm sorry. I just thought
you would like it.

691
00:44:56.926 --> 00:45:00.366
- Why don't we just stick to make-believe, okay?
- Yeah.

692
00:45:00.447 --> 00:45:03.007
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no, it's okay. I'm sorry.

693
00:45:04.367 --> 00:45:06.406
I'm sticking to make-believe.

694
00:45:06.486 --> 00:45:09.806
- Are you cold?
- Yeah, let's go back home. Sorry.

695
00:45:09.887 --> 00:45:12.207
- I'm cold. I'm just...
- Let's go back home.

696
00:45:13.687 --> 00:45:15.927
Yeah, see, I'm freezing.

697
00:45:57.126 --> 00:46:02.326
If I get pumped full of radiation, I should at
least have superpowers or something, you know?

698
00:46:02.407 --> 00:46:04.806
I mean, come on.

699
00:46:09.287 --> 00:46:11.447
Where's...? Where's Sleepy Simon?

700
00:46:13.967 --> 00:46:16.367
Sleepy Simon won the bet.

701
00:46:22.007 --> 00:46:24.487
What about the ability to control ants?

702
00:46:25.567 --> 00:46:31.806
I thought about that quite a lot, like... There's
10 trillion ants in the world. Did you know that?

703
00:46:52.006 --> 00:46:53.366
Thank you, baby.

704
00:46:53.447 --> 00:46:56.806
No problem, let's get you in bed.

705
00:47:02.566 --> 00:47:03.687
Do you wanna stay?

706
00:47:03.766 --> 00:47:07.766
I can't. I have to... I have homework.

707
00:47:08.767 --> 00:47:12.207
I get it. I'm just gonna
buzz out of your way.

708
00:47:25.127 --> 00:47:26.806
They're from my mom.

709
00:47:26.887 --> 00:47:33.247
Every birthday, Christmas, and Thanksgiving
for the last 12 years.

710
00:47:36.487 --> 00:47:39.046
Speaking of parents...

711
00:47:40.406 --> 00:47:42.487
mine wanna meet you.

712
00:47:46.247 --> 00:47:47.686
Izzy?

713
00:47:48.646 --> 00:47:51.127
- Izzy.
- I'm awake.

714
00:47:52.087 --> 00:47:55.807
I'm just picturing what an
epic disaster that's gonna be.

715
00:47:56.927 --> 00:47:59.606
So count me in.

716
00:48:10.047 --> 00:48:15.807
I think you're really gonna like Isabelle,
Dad. She's really awesome. And Phil...

717
00:48:16.807 --> 00:48:18.207
Phil is...

718
00:48:18.287 --> 00:48:19.407
Right just on time.

719
00:48:19.486 --> 00:48:22.086
- Yeah, Dad, let me get this.
- Son, I got it.

720
00:48:23.647 --> 00:48:25.646
I made a casserole.

721
00:48:27.327 --> 00:48:29.007
Which one of you is Isabelle?

722
00:48:30.247 --> 00:48:33.486
- Please, come on in.
- It's so nice to meet you, sir.

723
00:48:33.567 --> 00:48:36.447
- Please, come in.
- I got you something.

724
00:48:36.527 --> 00:48:38.647
It's small and stupid, but...

725
00:48:39.887 --> 00:48:44.326
Thank you. It's Christmas Eve. I should've
gotten something for you, and I didn't.

726
00:48:44.407 --> 00:48:46.567
- And I feel terrible.
- You messed up.

727
00:48:46.646 --> 00:48:49.287
- Yes, I did.
- I must be rubbing off on you.

728
00:48:52.247 --> 00:48:53.327
Thank you.

729
00:48:53.407 --> 00:48:55.527
Let me get this for you.

730
00:48:55.607 --> 00:48:58.446
Xavier and I, we went to
Wilkinsburg High School,

731
00:48:58.527 --> 00:49:01.847
and then we moved
into this tiny, shabby studio apartment

732
00:49:01.927 --> 00:49:04.367
about two blocks away from the tap house.

733
00:49:04.447 --> 00:49:06.406
That place is now the Club Mirella,

734
00:49:06.487 --> 00:49:09.887
and shield your eyes
for you are gazing upon their headliner.

735
00:49:09.966 --> 00:49:12.647
Oh, no applause, please. Hey, stop that.

736
00:49:12.727 --> 00:49:15.607
Nasty girl. I told you, no applause.

737
00:49:16.567 --> 00:49:20.727
- Isabelle, you must be very proud of your father.
- I don't have a father.

738
00:49:21.807 --> 00:49:25.527
- I'm more of a super-fun au pair.
- Yeah.

739
00:49:26.686 --> 00:49:28.886
Well, you'll have to get us tickets.

740
00:49:28.967 --> 00:49:31.967
- I can't believe you guys are from Wilkinsburg.
- Yes.

741
00:49:32.046 --> 00:49:38.007
- Xavier was a janitor, and then he bought the company.
- I believe the proper term is custodial attendant.

742
00:49:38.086 --> 00:49:40.767
- Thank you. I appreciate that.
- From Wilkinsburg to all this.

743
00:49:40.847 --> 00:49:44.007
- That is very inspirational.
- Well, we're very blessed.

744
00:49:44.087 --> 00:49:48.287
What we did is we worked hard.
Wilkinsburg is no place to raise a child.

745
00:49:48.366 --> 00:49:51.646
Oh, I don't know. You
turned out just fine, diva.

746
00:49:51.727 --> 00:49:54.526
You're just saying that
because you see the house we live in now.

747
00:49:54.607 --> 00:49:58.807
You didn't see the toilets I had to clean,
or the days we went hungry.

748
00:49:58.887 --> 00:50:00.367
It wasn't that bad.

749
00:50:00.447 --> 00:50:03.927
Nights sitting in a chair with a broom,
keeping the rats out of Daryn's crib.

750
00:50:04.006 --> 00:50:07.846
- I don't remember any of that.
- Good. It's because we made a plan.

751
00:50:07.927 --> 00:50:10.287
But sometimes, bad shit just happens.

752
00:50:11.567 --> 00:50:14.687
I mean, some stuff you can't
keep away with a broom, right?

753
00:50:14.767 --> 00:50:15.767
Apparently not.

754
00:50:16.886 --> 00:50:20.527
You know, I just love these candlesticks.
Are they silver?

755
00:50:20.607 --> 00:50:23.327
Actually, I believe those are pewter.

756
00:50:23.407 --> 00:50:28.287
- So, Isabelle, where do you go to school?
- She's homeschooled, actually.

757
00:50:29.887 --> 00:50:33.687
- What about college?
- I hadn't given it much thought yet.

758
00:50:34.647 --> 00:50:38.367
- Not everybody is destined for higher education.
- I actually couldn't agree more.

759
00:50:38.447 --> 00:50:41.967
I think the world could do with a few
less fancy degrees and a few more artists.

760
00:50:42.047 --> 00:50:45.087
- Who live in their parents' basements.
- Like half of all college grads?

761
00:50:47.007 --> 00:50:49.487
- Dessert?
- Daryn is destined to do great things.

762
00:50:49.567 --> 00:50:55.287
- Maybe he's already doing great things.
- The first steps to any plan is identifying a proper goal.

763
00:50:55.367 --> 00:50:57.167
Harvard undergraduate first.

764
00:50:57.247 --> 00:50:59.967
- Then, Yale Law.
- I just got exhausted even listening to that shit.

765
00:51:00.007 --> 00:51:02.127
Not everybody can be a super-fun au pair.

766
00:51:02.207 --> 00:51:05.127
- Maybe that's enough, Xavier.
- Because I'm his father, and he is my son.

767
00:51:05.166 --> 00:51:07.127
- Dad.
- We have a responsibility to each other.

768
00:51:07.207 --> 00:51:10.367
- He puts his faith in me, and I protect him.
- From what, zombies?

769
00:51:10.447 --> 00:51:11.847
- No, from you.
- Excuse you!

770
00:51:11.927 --> 00:51:13.607
- Girls like you, girls your type.
- Dad.

771
00:51:13.687 --> 00:51:14.607
- I am so sorry.
- Dad!

772
00:51:14.687 --> 00:51:17.607
- ...distraction that you've become in his life.
- Dad, I got waitlisted!

773
00:51:19.287 --> 00:51:20.287
Excuse me?

774
00:51:20.367 --> 00:51:23.807
- Well, that's not a no, so let's remain positive.
- When did you find this out?

775
00:51:25.127 --> 00:51:27.448
- A week or two ago.
- And you're just telling me this now?

776
00:51:27.487 --> 00:51:29.407
- I'm sure he had a reason.
- Stop coddling him!

777
00:51:31.687 --> 00:51:34.967
Don't you see he's throwing his life
away for you? How can you be this selfish?

778
00:51:35.047 --> 00:51:39.087
- I mean, there's no future here.
- Okay, enough. Let's go. We're going.

779
00:51:39.167 --> 00:51:41.967
- I am really sorry.
- Stand up. Here we go, sweetheart.

780
00:51:42.047 --> 00:51:43.047
Daryn.

781
00:51:44.847 --> 00:51:47.407
Come here, sweetheart. Easy.

782
00:51:47.487 --> 00:51:50.007
- Thank you for the wonderful dinner, Catherine.
- I'm sorry.

783
00:51:50.087 --> 00:51:52.447
And this is mine now, bitch.

784
00:51:56.767 --> 00:51:59.087
I hope you're happy, son.

785
00:53:33.647 --> 00:53:39.487
I managed to get us a meeting with James
Maxwell. We have to be perfect in there, son.

786
00:53:39.567 --> 00:53:44.408
Don't focus so much on athletic accomplishments,
and make sure to mention Honors Society.

787
00:53:44.487 --> 00:53:49.127
All right, hey, just stick to the
script, okay? Just stick to the script.

788
00:53:50.168 --> 00:53:52.647
One foot and then the other.

789
00:53:53.447 --> 00:53:56.727
- I see you've been waitlisted.
- Yes, sir.

790
00:53:58.287 --> 00:53:59.647
At least it's not a no.

791
00:54:01.287 --> 00:54:04.327
Yeah, yeah, your grades
have slipped a little lately.

792
00:54:04.407 --> 00:54:08.287
A temporary situation
that has been rectified.

793
00:54:10.647 --> 00:54:15.687
Honestly, this is just a paper
that tells me what you've done.

794
00:54:15.767 --> 00:54:20.087
What I'm really interested
in is who you are.

795
00:54:20.167 --> 00:54:24.287
Well, I'm captain of the varsity track team.
I'm a member of National Honors Society.

796
00:54:24.367 --> 00:54:30.327
And I have the state
record in the 5000-meter...

797
00:54:32.447 --> 00:54:33.887
And I have a...

798
00:54:36.487 --> 00:54:37.847
...GPA of...

799
00:54:40.607 --> 00:54:45.327
I'm listing a bunch of bullshit right now.

800
00:54:45.407 --> 00:54:46.408
Here's who I am.

801
00:54:46.487 --> 00:54:49.927
I might suck at punching people, but I
can get an entire ice cream shop going.

802
00:54:50.007 --> 00:54:53.007
I can eat like a person,
but I can also be an asshole.

803
00:54:53.087 --> 00:54:58.647
I know that greatness requires sacrifice, hard work, and
dedication, but I also know that clouds are for cupids.

804
00:54:58.727 --> 00:55:01.647
And some things you just
can't keep away with a broom.

805
00:55:01.727 --> 00:55:05.367
And I know that I have to be true to myself
before I can be true to her, but...

806
00:55:10.367 --> 00:55:12.367
she's not here right now.

807
00:55:13.567 --> 00:55:16.448
I'm sorry. I've wasted your
time, sir. So I'm gonna go.

808
00:55:17.927 --> 00:55:21.167
- And nice to see you again, Daryn.
- It's good to see you as well, Mr. Maxwell.

809
00:55:21.248 --> 00:55:24.327
- I gotta go.
- Excuse me for a moment.

810
00:55:51.087 --> 00:55:52.527
How did it go?

811
00:55:56.327 --> 00:55:57.887
Wait!

812
00:55:59.327 --> 00:56:01.487
You're a stupid, selfish child.

813
00:56:01.568 --> 00:56:05.287
All this hard work, all this sacrifice, you're
just gonna throw it away for a damn girl?

814
00:56:05.367 --> 00:56:09.167
- Her name is Isabelle! She's not just some damn girl!
- Xavier!

815
00:56:09.248 --> 00:56:11.568
- We had a plan!
- You know what I think of that plan?

816
00:56:11.647 --> 00:56:13.167
Let me show you what I think!

817
00:56:13.247 --> 00:56:15.207
- Hey! Come here!
- Xavier!

818
00:56:15.288 --> 00:56:18.607
- Let me show you what I think about your plan!
- Hey!

819
00:56:18.687 --> 00:56:22.647
- I hate your plan!
- What are you doing? Stop it! Stop!

820
00:56:22.727 --> 00:56:26.047
- I've always hated it!
- Stop! Stop! Stop!

821
00:56:26.127 --> 00:56:28.848
- Stop!
- Hey! Don't you dare!

822
00:56:32.527 --> 00:56:34.287
We had a plan, son.

823
00:56:34.367 --> 00:56:37.527
- This is what we worked for. This is your dream.
- This is your dream!

824
00:56:37.607 --> 00:56:40.047
This is your dream!

825
00:56:41.727 --> 00:56:44.088
You don't even know my dreams!

826
00:56:46.008 --> 00:56:50.087
I have always supported you,
but I will not lose my son over this.

827
00:56:51.608 --> 00:56:53.287
Daryn?

828
00:57:00.408 --> 00:57:01.488
Isabelle.

829
00:57:03.087 --> 00:57:04.887
Isabelle!

830
00:57:08.327 --> 00:57:09.887
Isabelle.

831
00:57:09.967 --> 00:57:12.007
Isabelle!

832
00:57:12.967 --> 00:57:15.247
Izzy. Izzy, please, no!

833
00:57:15.327 --> 00:57:19.367
I'm done with this! I'm over
with it! It's not like before!

834
00:57:19.448 --> 00:57:22.567
I'm so sorry, Izzy. I should have never
let my father treat you like that.

835
00:57:22.647 --> 00:57:27.647
I was just so nervous about Harvard, about
our future, about so many things, Izzy,

836
00:57:27.727 --> 00:57:30.568
but that was so stupid, and I
should have stood up for you.

837
00:57:30.647 --> 00:57:33.487
I know that it's too late,
but I tore down the plan.

838
00:57:33.567 --> 00:57:35.248
- I'm done with it.
- Hey, shut up!

839
00:57:35.327 --> 00:57:36.927
Yo, you shut up!

840
00:57:37.008 --> 00:57:38.767
Izzy, don't go! I just...

841
00:57:38.847 --> 00:57:43.127
No more milestones, no more pretending,
no more fairy tales and make-believe!

842
00:57:43.208 --> 00:57:47.247
None of that! I just... I don't want
the life that we should have had...

843
00:57:51.288 --> 00:57:53.328
I just want our life.

844
00:58:01.207 --> 00:58:04.687
Get up. Drama queen.

845
00:58:17.567 --> 00:58:19.248
One more?

846
00:58:19.327 --> 00:58:21.048
One more.

847
00:58:21.127 --> 00:58:22.127
Let's go.

848
00:58:33.847 --> 00:58:35.407
Where are we going, Square?

849
00:58:37.768 --> 00:58:40.767
What? Where are you taking me?

850
00:58:42.887 --> 00:58:44.208
We'll see.

851
00:58:44.287 --> 00:58:46.568
Oh, mysterious Square.

852
00:58:46.647 --> 00:58:48.687
If I tickle you, will you tell me?

853
00:58:55.967 --> 00:58:59.048
- See, there's just police. There's police.
- Square!

854
00:59:01.248 --> 00:59:02.647
Look, baby.

855
00:59:02.728 --> 00:59:06.767
- You can't see anything! We're gonna crash!
- Baby.

856
00:59:34.688 --> 00:59:36.167
All right.

857
00:59:37.207 --> 00:59:39.727
I think this is all we have.

858
00:59:39.807 --> 00:59:42.248
Don't worry. I got this.

859
00:59:52.167 --> 00:59:53.167
How you doing?

860
01:00:05.288 --> 01:00:08.767
Isabelle! Izzy! Izzy, start the car!

861
01:00:08.848 --> 01:00:10.248
You are insane!

862
01:00:11.208 --> 01:00:13.648
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

863
01:00:14.687 --> 01:00:16.487
- All right.
- Get back here, you are done!

864
01:00:16.567 --> 01:00:18.247
- Balls, balls, balls!
- You piece of shit!

865
01:00:18.328 --> 01:00:19.528
I'm gonna kill you!

866
01:00:19.607 --> 01:00:23.248
Oh, my God!

867
01:00:25.448 --> 01:00:29.767
Holy shit! Oh, my God,
he had a baseball bat!

868
01:00:29.848 --> 01:00:34.608
- That was amazing. I am so proud of you, you weirdo.
- All right. That's great.

869
01:00:36.848 --> 01:00:38.368
- Okay.
- I can't believe it.

870
01:00:38.448 --> 01:00:40.008
You robbed your first shop.

871
01:00:40.088 --> 01:00:41.248
Oh, my gosh.

872
01:01:45.047 --> 01:01:47.768
This is pretty cool, Square.

873
01:02:15.487 --> 01:02:16.688
Thank you.

874
01:02:17.488 --> 01:02:19.448
Fire, yo.

875
01:02:19.528 --> 01:02:21.048
Oh, my God.

876
01:02:21.127 --> 01:02:24.488
- What is that?
- Come on, just take one good guess.

877
01:02:39.048 --> 01:02:41.407
- Look.
- Oh, my God... Iz!

878
01:02:41.488 --> 01:02:44.287
- Izzy, what is that?
- It's a baby hedgehog.

879
01:02:44.368 --> 01:02:47.327
- You should put it back.
- What are you talking about?

880
01:02:47.408 --> 01:02:49.568
His mom's roadkill. He's an orphan.

881
01:02:49.647 --> 01:02:50.968
- Okay.
- Poor little guy.

882
01:02:51.047 --> 01:02:53.367
I'm gonna name him Square, after you.

883
01:02:53.448 --> 01:02:56.087
Kind of like George Foreman,
when he names all his kids George.

884
01:02:56.168 --> 01:02:59.288
- Yeah.
- Square Jr., meet Papa Square.

885
01:03:02.608 --> 01:03:05.368
Whoa, whoa, baby, baby, are you okay?

886
01:03:05.447 --> 01:03:07.367
I'm fine. I'm totally fine.

887
01:03:07.448 --> 01:03:09.608
This is why you shouldn't do drugs.

888
01:03:09.687 --> 01:03:12.567
- Oh, I don't feel good.
- Poor Papa Square.

889
01:03:12.648 --> 01:03:14.928
What did you do? Eat it?

890
01:03:27.647 --> 01:03:30.848
- What was that?
- Nothing. Some idiot just broke a lamp.

891
01:03:32.888 --> 01:03:34.888
Oh, my God, this is insane.

892
01:03:39.968 --> 01:03:44.127
- So I think Big Sean's performing here tomorrow.
- We should go.

893
01:03:44.208 --> 01:03:48.927
- Maybe this time, we'll actually get to see the show.
- Yeah, that would be a lot of fun.

894
01:04:01.048 --> 01:04:04.608
Oh, is it too much? Do I look stupid?

895
01:04:04.687 --> 01:04:08.608
No. Not at all. You
look absolutely amazing.

896
01:04:31.007 --> 01:04:32.127
Hey, wait.

897
01:04:33.408 --> 01:04:35.048
It's okay.

898
01:04:36.448 --> 01:04:38.328
It's okay, baby.

899
01:04:43.728 --> 01:04:45.567
You're so beautiful.

900
01:05:32.047 --> 01:05:34.808
This is amazing!

901
01:05:34.887 --> 01:05:36.888
This is so awesome!

902
01:05:39.207 --> 01:05:40.687
He's so good.

903
01:05:42.207 --> 01:05:45.607
Hey! Look. I made you something.

904
01:05:45.688 --> 01:05:50.168
- What's this?
- It's the demo you recorded. I made it all fancy for you.

905
01:05:50.248 --> 01:05:52.767
Iz, are you serious?

906
01:05:52.847 --> 01:05:56.168
- Listen, you have to give it to Big Sean.
- This is awesome. D... Wait, what?

907
01:05:56.247 --> 01:05:58.768
- All right? Come on, Daryn.
- I can't give this to Big Sean

908
01:05:58.848 --> 01:06:02.008
- I'm not joking, all right? You have to do this!
- How?

909
01:06:02.086 --> 01:06:04.808
You'll figure it out. Just promise me.

910
01:06:04.887 --> 01:06:06.928
- Promise?
- Okay, yeah, I promise.

911
01:06:07.008 --> 01:06:09.048
Okay. Here.

912
01:06:09.128 --> 01:06:12.048
- Hey.
- Take Junior. I've got to run, all right?

913
01:06:12.127 --> 01:06:14.048
- Good luck.
- Run where? What are you going?

914
01:06:14.128 --> 01:06:16.728
- Izzy, whatever you're...
- Hey, Hulk Ass!

915
01:06:16.808 --> 01:06:18.248
Yeah, you! Remember me?

916
01:06:18.328 --> 01:06:20.287
- How's that shnoz of yours?
- You!

917
01:06:20.368 --> 01:06:22.128
Hey! Come here!

918
01:06:22.208 --> 01:06:26.087
- I'll meet you at the car!
- Hey! Stop her!

919
01:06:32.008 --> 01:06:35.927
One foot then the other.

920
01:06:41.887 --> 01:06:44.728
Hey, thank you, Philly!

921
01:06:58.488 --> 01:07:00.128
What is that thing?

922
01:07:00.207 --> 01:07:03.488
- This is a...
- Yo, is that a hedgehog?

923
01:07:05.528 --> 01:07:07.968
Yeah. Yeah, this is Square Jr.

924
01:07:08.047 --> 01:07:12.368
Man, he's your biggest fan. I swear he's
got all your albums in chronological order.

925
01:07:12.447 --> 01:07:14.528
- Yo, I gotta get a photo.
- Oh, yeah.

926
01:07:14.608 --> 01:07:15.408
- Yeah.
- Let's do it.

927
01:07:15.488 --> 01:07:18.848
- You, take the photo of me and the hedgehog.
- Oh, yeah. Sure.

928
01:07:18.928 --> 01:07:21.568
- That's so cool.
- Totally, right?

929
01:07:21.648 --> 01:07:24.168
- Okay, one, two, three.
- One more.

930
01:07:24.248 --> 01:07:25.248
I love animals.

931
01:07:25.328 --> 01:07:27.408
- Put the hedgehog up a little more.
- Yeah, yeah.

932
01:07:27.488 --> 01:07:31.128
- No, just... It's all right.
- I do love animals. There you go.

933
01:07:31.208 --> 01:07:33.048
- Here you go.
- Oh, yeah, thanks.

934
01:07:33.128 --> 01:07:34.288
Hi, little guy.

935
01:07:35.328 --> 01:07:38.208
- Brian, what happened to your nose, man?
- What?

936
01:07:39.528 --> 01:07:41.008
Some big dude jumped me.

937
01:07:41.088 --> 01:07:43.167
- Again?
- Yeah, again.

938
01:07:43.248 --> 01:07:45.168
You gotta be more careful, man.

939
01:07:45.248 --> 01:07:46.568
Yeah, whatever.

940
01:07:48.408 --> 01:07:50.928
- My bodyguard needs a bodyguard.
- I'll protect you!

941
01:07:51.008 --> 01:07:53.928
Yo, yo, is there...?

942
01:08:05.768 --> 01:08:08.928
And then, he's like, "Is that a hedgehog?"
I'm like, "Yeah, this is Square Jr."

943
01:08:09.008 --> 01:08:10.448
He's like, "We have to get a pic."

944
01:08:10.528 --> 01:08:11.967
Then the security guard comes back,

945
01:08:12.048 --> 01:08:15.128
so I have to hide behind that person
that was taking the picture,

946
01:08:15.208 --> 01:08:17.928
And then... And then, he goes.
The security guard leaves again.

947
01:08:18.008 --> 01:08:21.448
I gave him the CD.
I was like, "Hey, will you listen to this?"

948
01:08:21.528 --> 01:08:24.488
And he was like, "Yeah, sure."
And I was like, "Wow."

949
01:08:24.568 --> 01:08:28.888
The fact that he would even take
that from a fan, I was like, "Okay, cool."

950
01:08:28.968 --> 01:08:33.087
That was really, really awesome for me,
but maybe he'll actually listen to the CD.

951
01:08:33.168 --> 01:08:38.048
You know, maybe in the car on the way home, whatever.
But, you know, that would be really, really cool.

952
01:08:38.128 --> 01:08:42.048
Just to hear feedback. I don't know. I just
hope I can meet him again, one day, too.

953
01:08:42.128 --> 01:08:45.088
See if he likes it. Regardless...

954
01:08:53.768 --> 01:08:55.048
Izzy.

955
01:08:55.128 --> 01:08:56.808
Cutie-pie.

956
01:08:58.008 --> 01:09:01.688
- We're here.
- Where?

957
01:09:02.728 --> 01:09:03.968
Look.

958
01:09:07.888 --> 01:09:08.808
Shit.

959
01:09:08.888 --> 01:09:09.688
- Izzy...
- Shit.

960
01:09:09.768 --> 01:09:11.528
- Izzy.
- You're an asshole.

961
01:09:11.608 --> 01:09:13.248
- Izzy.
- That's my mom.

962
01:09:13.328 --> 01:09:15.048
- That's your mom.
- What is wrong with you?

963
01:09:15.088 --> 01:09:16.888
You're so stupid.

964
01:09:16.968 --> 01:09:18.528
Why? Why did you do this?

965
01:09:18.608 --> 01:09:21.488
- I thought...
- I could kill you right now. How did you even find her?

966
01:09:21.568 --> 01:09:24.368
The postcards were a start.
But Sammy and Kiran helped a lot.

967
01:09:24.448 --> 01:09:28.408
Oh, my God, I'm gonna kill them,
and then, I'm gonna kill you.

968
01:09:34.048 --> 01:09:36.808
- She looks old.
- Maybe I'm crazy,

969
01:09:36.888 --> 01:09:38.928
- but I think you should go talk to her.
- What?

970
01:09:40.048 --> 01:09:43.048
- What am I gonna say?
- I mean, you're Isabelle,

971
01:09:43.128 --> 01:09:44.328
you can do anything.

972
01:09:45.968 --> 01:09:47.688
And I'm gonna be right here.

973
01:09:48.648 --> 01:09:50.168
Okay?

974
01:09:56.728 --> 01:09:59.128
- Balls, balls, balls...
- Balls, balls, balls...

975
01:10:16.448 --> 01:10:17.808
Hi.

976
01:10:20.328 --> 01:10:21.568
Isabelle?

977
01:10:26.288 --> 01:10:28.128
What are you doing here?

978
01:10:29.088 --> 01:10:30.328
Mommy?

979
01:10:31.848 --> 01:10:35.448
Go inside. Mommy will be right in
in a minute.

980
01:10:36.688 --> 01:10:38.168
Go inside, baby.

981
01:10:38.248 --> 01:10:39.888
Is that you, Amanda?

982
01:10:39.968 --> 01:10:41.008
You have to go.

983
01:10:43.008 --> 01:10:43.808
Please.

984
01:10:43.888 --> 01:10:46.248
Mommy, who is that?

985
01:10:46.328 --> 01:10:48.168
Come on, baby.

986
01:10:48.248 --> 01:10:50.448
I'll make you a snack, okay? Good girl.

987
01:10:50.528 --> 01:10:52.248
Inside.

988
01:11:02.449 --> 01:11:04.088
Let's go.

989
01:11:09.488 --> 01:11:10.768
I didn't...

990
01:11:10.848 --> 01:11:12.528
Daryn, please don't, just...

991
01:11:12.608 --> 01:11:15.528
- I didn't...
- Stop talking.

992
01:11:18.728 --> 01:11:20.488
Izzy...

993
01:11:21.688 --> 01:11:25.408
In an interview, Sean says that sometimes it's
not the destination, it's the journey that...

994
01:11:25.489 --> 01:11:29.329
Really, Daryn? You are throwing Big Sean
at my face right now?

995
01:11:29.408 --> 01:11:30.408
Are you joking?

996
01:11:30.448 --> 01:11:33.049
- Are you really doing that, Daryn?
- What's wrong? What did I do?

997
01:11:33.128 --> 01:11:34.968
You don't even... I'm so stupid.

998
01:11:35.048 --> 01:11:39.408
- I'm so stupid! Why did I do that?
- Izzy!

999
01:11:39.489 --> 01:11:41.768
Calm down! You're gonna hurt yourself.

1000
01:11:41.848 --> 01:11:44.728
Don't touch me! Don't ever touch me again!

1001
01:11:44.808 --> 01:11:46.048
You are disgusting.

1002
01:11:46.128 --> 01:11:48.208
- You're just like everybody else.
- What did I do?

1003
01:11:48.288 --> 01:11:51.808
You promised! You promised
and you lied to me! You're a liar.

1004
01:11:51.888 --> 01:11:54.408
- I lied to you?
- I saw you, Daryn.

1005
01:11:54.488 --> 01:11:56.808
I saw you with Big Sean.

1006
01:11:57.928 --> 01:12:01.648
Why did I trust you? Get me out of the car.
Let me out of the car!

1007
01:12:01.728 --> 01:12:03.408
Stop the car, I'm getting out!

1008
01:12:03.489 --> 01:12:05.448
- Get off me.
- What are you doing?

1009
01:12:05.528 --> 01:12:07.528
Let me out of the goddamn car!

1010
01:12:07.609 --> 01:12:09.769
- Get me out of this car!
- We're in the middle of a...

1011
01:12:10.928 --> 01:12:12.809
Izzy, watch out!

1012
01:12:14.449 --> 01:12:15.848
Are you okay...?

1013
01:12:16.808 --> 01:12:18.169
Isabelle, wait.

1014
01:12:18.248 --> 01:12:19.129
Izzy!

1015
01:12:19.208 --> 01:12:20.248
Isabelle, wait.

1016
01:12:20.328 --> 01:12:21.328
I'm sorry!

1017
01:12:22.648 --> 01:12:23.929
Isabelle.

1018
01:12:24.008 --> 01:12:27.408
Okay, I'm sorry, I didn't give it to him.
I lied. All right?

1019
01:12:27.489 --> 01:12:32.528
What if he didn't like it? What if he laughed
at me? I chickened out. I'm sorry, Isabelle.

1020
01:12:34.048 --> 01:12:39.848
She wanted to be a mom,
but she didn't wanna be my mom.

1021
01:12:42.449 --> 01:12:44.968
- What's wrong with me?
- There's nothing wrong with you.

1022
01:12:45.049 --> 01:12:47.328
You gotta go. You gotta get away from me...

1023
01:12:47.408 --> 01:12:50.568
- Please go.
- There's nothing wrong with you.

1024
01:12:50.648 --> 01:12:52.408
There's nothing wrong with you.

1025
01:12:52.488 --> 01:12:55.288
Izzy! Izzy! Izzy!

1026
01:12:55.368 --> 01:12:59.488
What's going on? Izzy!
Somebody help us! Please!

1027
01:12:59.569 --> 01:13:02.408
Look, we're at the beach.
Izzy, we're at the beach.

1028
01:13:02.488 --> 01:13:06.368
We're here. Look. We got the
sand all around us and everything.

1029
01:13:06.449 --> 01:13:09.608
It's just like your dream.
It's just like your dream.

1030
01:13:46.528 --> 01:13:48.969
The ovarian tumor has metastasized.

1031
01:13:49.048 --> 01:13:52.048
It's in her blood. In her organs.

1032
01:13:53.048 --> 01:13:56.248
Here's the schedule for her meds.
She's gotta keep to it.

1033
01:13:56.328 --> 01:13:57.648
What about chemo?

1034
01:13:58.768 --> 01:13:59.768
That's done.

1035
01:13:59.809 --> 01:14:03.089
It isn't about treatment anymore.
It's about management.

1036
01:14:03.168 --> 01:14:04.729
Managing her pain.

1037
01:14:04.808 --> 01:14:06.369
Managing your expectations.

1038
01:14:06.448 --> 01:14:08.728
But she wasn't in any pain.

1039
01:14:08.808 --> 01:14:12.689
I imagine she was hiding
just how much pain she was in.

1040
01:14:30.888 --> 01:14:32.449
So you're leaving?

1041
01:14:32.528 --> 01:14:36.409
Call me if you have
any questions. I'm sorry.

1042
01:14:39.728 --> 01:14:41.489
Sammy, if you do a grocery run on Wednesday

1043
01:14:41.568 --> 01:14:44.249
that will give me time to clean
while the hospice worker is here.

1044
01:14:44.328 --> 01:14:47.288
Kiran, you're on pharmacy duty.
I'll call in the orders, you pick them up.

1045
01:14:47.369 --> 01:14:48.168
Sure.

1046
01:14:48.248 --> 01:14:51.248
- Thank you, guys. I really appreciate it.
- No problem.

1047
01:14:51.328 --> 01:14:52.568
It's mine.

1048
01:14:53.528 --> 01:14:55.928
Why are you still here?

1049
01:15:07.848 --> 01:15:08.848
Hey, baby.

1050
01:15:09.688 --> 01:15:14.088
The instructions say that you can't take
your medication on an empty stomach.

1051
01:15:14.168 --> 01:15:16.928
So I made some pancakes for you.

1052
01:15:19.288 --> 01:15:21.488
I thought it would be the best...

1053
01:15:22.649 --> 01:15:23.768
All right.

1054
01:15:23.849 --> 01:15:25.608
Good thing I made more.

1055
01:15:25.688 --> 01:15:27.528
They'll end up on the floor too.

1056
01:15:27.608 --> 01:15:32.888
You know what, baby? I love making pancakes.
I almost went to culinary school, okay?

1057
01:15:32.968 --> 01:15:36.728
So I'm just gonna do my training
in here right now, just all the blades:

1058
01:15:36.808 --> 01:15:39.288
Like I'm a freaking ninja...

1059
01:16:09.409 --> 01:16:14.408
So there was this douchebag security guard
and Daryn punched him in the face.

1060
01:16:14.489 --> 01:16:18.208
I don't believe you. My baby
did not do that. He is not a fighter.

1061
01:16:18.289 --> 01:16:20.848
I promise you he did.
He was just really bad at it.

1062
01:16:20.929 --> 01:16:23.008
- Mom?
- Good morning.

1063
01:16:23.089 --> 01:16:24.448
What are you doing here?

1064
01:16:24.528 --> 01:16:28.128
Well, a friend gave me VIP tickets
to Club Mirella, and I couldn't resist.

1065
01:16:28.209 --> 01:16:29.449
So here I am.

1066
01:16:29.528 --> 01:16:33.568
So the three of us have decided
that you really need to take a day off.

1067
01:16:33.649 --> 01:16:36.208
Hang with Sammy and Kiran, do something.

1068
01:16:36.289 --> 01:16:39.248
Your mother will take care of Izzy
when I go to work.

1069
01:16:39.329 --> 01:16:40.728
I promise I'll be fine.

1070
01:16:40.809 --> 01:16:43.689
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

1071
01:16:43.768 --> 01:16:46.729
- Will you do me one favor though?
- Anything.

1072
01:16:46.808 --> 01:16:49.849
You really need to
shower. You smell so bad.

1073
01:16:49.928 --> 01:16:52.609
- I thought that was me.
- That's enough. Come on.

1074
01:16:55.489 --> 01:17:00.048
- Thank you so much for allowing me to come back.
- All good. All good.

1075
01:17:01.769 --> 01:17:05.209
- What you got for me?
- Something. But it's rough.

1076
01:17:05.288 --> 01:17:07.208
That's more than most people got.

1077
01:17:47.449 --> 01:17:49.409
Oh, my God! Isabelle!

1078
01:17:50.449 --> 01:17:52.088
- Oh, my God.
- Mom?

1079
01:17:52.168 --> 01:17:55.048
- She's bleeding from her mouth! Oh, God.
- Izzy!

1080
01:17:55.129 --> 01:17:57.329
- Call 911. Call 911 right now!
- Where's my phone?

1081
01:17:57.408 --> 01:17:59.809
Let's get you on your side.

1082
01:17:59.888 --> 01:18:02.488
Yes, spit it out. Good girl.

1083
01:18:02.569 --> 01:18:04.849
- Is she breathing?
- Yes, she's breathing.

1084
01:18:04.928 --> 01:18:07.209
Everything's gonna be okay.

1085
01:18:07.288 --> 01:18:10.609
We have an emergency. Yes. 440 Holland...

1086
01:18:10.688 --> 01:18:13.809
Everything's gonna be okay.
Everything's gonna be fine.

1087
01:18:13.888 --> 01:18:17.209
Everything's gonna be fine. It's gonna
be okay. Everything's gonna be fine.

1088
01:18:25.248 --> 01:18:28.928
- How is she?
- She's stable. She's resting now.

1089
01:18:29.009 --> 01:18:32.329
Isabelle's teratoma has caused fluid
to build up in her abdominal cavity.

1090
01:18:32.408 --> 01:18:34.769
Vomiting is a common symptom.

1091
01:18:34.848 --> 01:18:36.289
- Okay.
- Okay.

1092
01:18:36.368 --> 01:18:37.649
So, what's next?

1093
01:18:37.728 --> 01:18:40.569
- We're gonna adjust her medication.
- And then what?

1094
01:18:40.649 --> 01:18:43.249
- Pardon?
- After you adjust her medication, then what?

1095
01:18:44.489 --> 01:18:47.809
- That's all we can do for such a young...
- What do you mean that's all you can do?

1096
01:18:47.849 --> 01:18:51.608
This is all we can do for a patient
as advanced as Isabelle.

1097
01:18:51.689 --> 01:18:55.929
The cancer has spread through her
entire body. Her organs are shutting down.

1098
01:18:56.009 --> 01:18:58.048
It's just a matter of weeks now. Sorry.

1099
01:18:58.129 --> 01:19:01.728
Makes no sense at all. That makes no sense.

1100
01:19:01.809 --> 01:19:05.089
We need new doctors. We need
new everything! Where is she?

1101
01:19:05.168 --> 01:19:06.769
Isabelle! We're going!

1102
01:19:06.849 --> 01:19:10.329
We're leaving now because they don't know
what the fuck they're doing in this place!

1103
01:19:11.208 --> 01:19:12.809
Izzy! Izzy! Baby!

1104
01:19:12.889 --> 01:19:14.088
- Isabelle!
- Daryn.

1105
01:19:14.169 --> 01:19:18.249
Isabelle! You'd still be okay right now
if I didn't go anywhere!

1106
01:19:18.328 --> 01:19:19.649
- No!
- Mom! Not right now!

1107
01:19:19.729 --> 01:19:21.129
- Listen to me!
- Not right now!

1108
01:19:21.208 --> 01:19:22.769
Stop it!

1109
01:19:24.849 --> 01:19:26.808
She is going to die.

1110
01:19:26.889 --> 01:19:29.769
- Why would you say that?
- Because that is the truth!

1111
01:19:29.848 --> 01:19:32.728
- Why would you say that?
- Because that is the truth!

1112
01:19:33.889 --> 01:19:36.049
That is the truth!

1113
01:19:36.129 --> 01:19:39.608
You have done everything that you can do
for her, Daryn.

1114
01:19:40.649 --> 01:19:44.128
She's not gonna die! She's not gonna die!
She's not gonna die!

1115
01:19:44.209 --> 01:19:45.929
Stop it.

1116
01:19:46.008 --> 01:19:50.288
- I can't breathe.
- Stop it.

1117
01:20:39.289 --> 01:20:40.289
Hey, baby.

1118
01:20:41.249 --> 01:20:43.088
I have somebody here to see you.

1119
01:20:43.169 --> 01:20:45.449
Is it Make A Wish?

1120
01:20:45.529 --> 01:20:48.929
Because there's some
weird shit I still want.

1121
01:20:50.969 --> 01:20:51.969
Iz?

1122
01:21:25.009 --> 01:21:26.209
Iz, please.

1123
01:21:45.768 --> 01:21:47.408
Mom.

1124
01:22:06.369 --> 01:22:08.209
I'm sorry.

1125
01:22:10.529 --> 01:22:12.248
I'm so, so sorry.

1126
01:22:17.009 --> 01:22:19.529
She was ashamed...

1127
01:22:19.609 --> 01:22:23.369
and afraid that she
would lose her new family.

1128
01:22:23.449 --> 01:22:28.049
That's why she didn't come back
after she got clean.

1129
01:22:30.328 --> 01:22:31.729
Why did you make her go?

1130
01:22:31.809 --> 01:22:37.328
Because there's some shit
you just don't get to come back from.

1131
01:22:40.409 --> 01:22:42.529
Come on, baby.

1132
01:22:45.809 --> 01:22:49.089
But I got to say goodbye.

1133
01:22:52.849 --> 01:22:53.849
Thank you.

1134
01:22:55.369 --> 01:22:57.169
Close your eyes.

1135
01:23:08.209 --> 01:23:11.009
I'll never forget you, Square.

1136
01:23:45.368 --> 01:23:46.889
- What's wrong?
- It's okay.

1137
01:23:46.969 --> 01:23:48.609
Go back to sleep.

1138
01:25:20.649 --> 01:25:21.889
Hey, pretty girl.

1139
01:25:22.849 --> 01:25:25.209
I need your help with something.

1140
01:25:28.529 --> 01:25:31.729
Phil told me to drop this off.
Should I just leave it with you?

1141
01:25:31.809 --> 01:25:33.929
I look like a mailbox?

1142
01:25:34.009 --> 01:25:35.209
My guy.

1143
01:25:41.409 --> 01:25:43.969
What's...? What's going on?

1144
01:25:44.049 --> 01:25:46.009
- A wedding is what's going on.
- Really?

1145
01:25:46.089 --> 01:25:47.729
Who's getting married?

1146
01:25:47.809 --> 01:25:49.409
You are, brother.

1147
01:25:50.769 --> 01:25:52.849
You guys are hilarious.

1148
01:25:52.929 --> 01:25:53.729
Yeah.

1149
01:25:53.809 --> 01:25:55.609
- Are you being serious?
- Yeah.

1150
01:25:55.689 --> 01:25:57.689
No. Who's actually getting married?

1151
01:25:57.769 --> 01:25:59.569
This is your moment.

1152
01:25:59.649 --> 01:26:01.249
Strut.

1153
01:26:04.969 --> 01:26:06.929
Our little boy is all grown up.

1154
01:26:16.049 --> 01:26:17.609
Hi.

1155
01:26:19.809 --> 01:26:20.929
Mom.

1156
01:26:22.289 --> 01:26:23.769
- Ron.
- What's up, playa?

1157
01:26:23.849 --> 01:26:25.049
What's up?

1158
01:26:25.129 --> 01:26:26.489
Look, look.

1159
01:26:29.129 --> 01:26:30.929
- Look at that.
- He's so cute.

1160
01:26:31.009 --> 01:26:33.529
- Oh, my God.
- Square Jr., he's adorable.

1161
01:26:34.649 --> 01:26:35.929
Where did you guys...?

1162
01:26:36.009 --> 01:26:38.049
Isabelle made us look for it.

1163
01:26:39.009 --> 01:26:42.529
We found it in the sewer.
Don't worry. We cleaned it.

1164
01:26:42.609 --> 01:26:44.849
- Did you clean it?
- Yeah, I cleaned it.

1165
01:26:45.809 --> 01:26:47.529
Thank you.

1166
01:27:16.809 --> 01:27:18.889
Did you do all of this for me?

1167
01:27:18.969 --> 01:27:20.290
I did.

1168
01:27:21.489 --> 01:27:22.969
But I thought you said...

1169
01:27:23.049 --> 01:27:26.089
Can't a classy bitch change her mind?

1170
01:27:27.690 --> 01:27:30.089
Do you wanna marry me or not, Square?

1171
01:27:30.169 --> 01:27:32.089
I do.

1172
01:27:33.249 --> 01:27:34.769
I do.

1173
01:27:34.849 --> 01:27:35.929
You better.

1174
01:27:37.049 --> 01:27:40.289
Because I'm about to
marry the shit out of you.

1175
01:27:42.049 --> 01:27:44.569
They say a day to God is a thousand years.

1176
01:27:44.649 --> 01:27:47.850
And people walk around
with a thousand fears.

1177
01:27:47.929 --> 01:27:51.889
But the true joy of love
That's why we all are here.

1178
01:27:51.970 --> 01:27:55.289
And with a pure heart
You can live life in a year.

1179
01:28:19.130 --> 01:28:23.249
From the power vested in me
by the online Internet reverend service,

1180
01:28:23.329 --> 01:28:26.689
I pronounce you man and wife.

1181
01:29:37.889 --> 01:29:38.889
Isabelle?

1182
01:29:38.929 --> 01:29:39.929
Isabelle...

1183
01:29:40.009 --> 01:29:41.569
Izzy...

1184
01:29:41.649 --> 01:29:42.769
Izzy.

1185
01:29:42.849 --> 01:29:44.809
Izzy? Isabelle?

1186
01:29:44.889 --> 01:29:45.969
Baby.

1187
01:29:46.049 --> 01:29:48.329
Baby, are you okay?

1188
01:29:49.609 --> 01:29:50.929
- No.
- What do you mean...?

1189
01:29:51.010 --> 01:29:53.049
- This...
- What do you need?

1190
01:29:54.129 --> 01:29:56.969
This is the last milestone.

1191
01:29:59.209 --> 01:30:02.329
- No. No, baby.
- It's okay.

1192
01:30:03.770 --> 01:30:05.889
Your plan worked.

1193
01:30:07.890 --> 01:30:12.849
- Izzy...
- You gave me happily ever after.

1194
01:30:14.529 --> 01:30:16.449
I know I shouldn't say this...

1195
01:30:17.529 --> 01:30:21.450
I love you too, Square.

1196
01:30:41.969 --> 01:30:43.049
Isabelle?

1197
01:30:43.130 --> 01:30:44.529
Izzy...

1198
01:30:48.369 --> 01:30:49.369
Izzy.

1199
01:30:49.409 --> 01:30:50.769
Izzy.

1200
01:30:50.849 --> 01:30:52.409
Baby. Izzy.

1201
01:30:52.489 --> 01:30:53.809
Izzy.

1202
01:30:57.530 --> 01:30:58.809
Baby.

1203
01:32:20.049 --> 01:32:22.209
I'm sorry, son.

1204
01:32:27.569 --> 01:32:29.209
I'm sorry.

1205
01:32:49.649 --> 01:32:52.170
I'm sorry, man. Funerals suck.

1206
01:32:55.689 --> 01:32:57.329
By the way...

1207
01:32:59.409 --> 01:33:00.570
you graduated today.

1208
01:33:03.330 --> 01:33:06.089
I mean, your GPA is kind of in the shitter.

1209
01:33:06.170 --> 01:33:07.810
But don't worry. You and Sammy can...

1210
01:33:07.889 --> 01:33:10.529
not go to college together. Or something.

1211
01:33:10.609 --> 01:33:14.290
Or you could apply to Pitt.
I mean they took me, so...

1212
01:33:17.570 --> 01:33:20.570
- Wait, you got into college?
- Yeah.

1213
01:33:20.649 --> 01:33:22.609
- What?
- Yeah.

1214
01:33:22.689 --> 01:33:24.649
I brought my grades up and...

1215
01:33:24.730 --> 01:33:27.929
- Don't make it weird, man.
- No. You...

1216
01:33:28.010 --> 01:33:30.490
- You did good, fat boy. You did good.
- Thank you.

1217
01:33:30.570 --> 01:33:32.530
You deserve it.

1218
01:33:33.490 --> 01:33:35.849
So, what are you gonna do?

1219
01:33:41.929 --> 01:33:47.450
- Where did you get this rust-bucket?
- Sammy gave me a real good price on it.

1220
01:33:47.529 --> 01:33:51.050
- What are you gonna do when you get to New York?
- Make music.

1221
01:33:51.129 --> 01:33:52.169
See what happens.

1222
01:33:53.409 --> 01:33:55.329
Well, I got you this.

1223
01:33:57.610 --> 01:33:59.650
Help you to stay organized.

1224
01:34:00.610 --> 01:34:02.609
I put a couple of things on your calendar.

1225
01:34:04.969 --> 01:34:06.650
There it is.

1226
01:34:09.489 --> 01:34:11.529
- I love you.
- I love you.

1227
01:34:13.209 --> 01:34:15.330
- I'll see you soon.
- Yeah.

1228
01:34:20.370 --> 01:34:22.769
Are you ready for this?

1229
01:34:24.210 --> 01:34:25.850
I thought so.

1230
01:34:53.529 --> 01:34:58.090
...never gotten a request quite like this one
before, it comes from a dying girl named Isabelle.

1231
01:34:58.169 --> 01:35:02.569
I'm gonna have to clean some of the
language up because my girl can curse.

1232
01:35:02.650 --> 01:35:04.250
So Isabelle writes:

1233
01:35:04.329 --> 01:35:08.690
"Everybody thinks that dying
teaches you something about life,

1234
01:35:08.770 --> 01:35:10.330
but they're wrong.

1235
01:35:11.690 --> 01:35:15.329
The only way to learn
about life is by living.

1236
01:35:15.410 --> 01:35:20.010
And I've learned that every moment
is your moment.

1237
01:35:20.089 --> 01:35:23.129
Sometimes the moments are messy,

1238
01:35:23.210 --> 01:35:25.370
sometimes they're beautiful,

1239
01:35:25.449 --> 01:35:29.049
or scary, or just plain weird.

1240
01:35:29.130 --> 01:35:31.170
But they're all yours.

1241
01:35:31.249 --> 01:35:32.970
Cherish them.

1242
01:35:33.050 --> 01:35:34.529
Living isn't easy.

1243
01:35:34.610 --> 01:35:40.610
But if you can manage to look past your
own fears and everyone else's expectations,

1244
01:35:41.649 --> 01:35:45.010
the reward is your life.

1245
01:35:45.089 --> 01:35:46.410
And in my life?

1246
01:35:50.530 --> 01:35:52.450
I was loved.

1247
01:35:54.450 --> 01:35:57.890
So, Daryn, one more?

1248
01:35:59.609 --> 01:36:04.330
She also sent me this track and told me I
had to play it or else she would haunt me.

1249
01:36:04.409 --> 01:36:09.769
So here is the world premiere from
local rapper, D Square, "A Life In A Year."

1250
01:36:09.850 --> 01:36:12.810
Yo, Pittsburgh, turn your radios up.

1251
01:36:28.650 --> 01:36:29.650
One more?

1252
01:36:32.649 --> 01:36:34.410
One more.

1253
01:37:16.608 --> 01:37:21.403
