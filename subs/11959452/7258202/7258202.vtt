2
00:02:34.908 --> 00:02:39.325
Can you confirm the identity of
these two people for me please?

3
00:02:40.325 --> 00:02:40.908
Yeah.

4
00:02:41.867 --> 00:02:44.325
That's Traian and...

5
00:02:45.533 --> 00:02:46.408
...Elinska.

6
00:02:47.075 --> 00:02:47.908
Eliska!

7
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.325
Yeah, that was it.

8
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.451
What about this girl?

9
00:02:53.658 --> 00:02:55.283
Do you know who she is?

10
00:02:55.325 --> 00:02:56.617
Of course I do.

11
00:02:57.908 --> 00:02:59.617
She's my girlfriend

12
00:03:02.325 --> 00:03:03.825
At least...

13
00:03:04.867 --> 00:03:06.242
...she was.

14
00:03:22.533 --> 00:03:23.200
Really?

15
00:03:23.242 --> 00:03:24.950
That's the last one, I promise.

16
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.616
Hold on...

17
00:03:26.658 --> 00:03:27.950
...imagine there's a little
gorilla on your left shoulder.

18
00:03:28.368 --> 00:03:29.575
What!?

19
00:03:29.617 --> 00:03:31.825
Trust me, just look at your left
shoulder, imagine it's there.

20
00:03:33.742 --> 00:03:35.783
You know I hate having my photo
taken.

21
00:03:35.825 --> 00:03:37.325
Can you blame me?

22
00:03:38.783 --> 00:03:40.533
You try going out with the most
gorgeous girl in the whole wide world.

23
00:03:47.533 --> 00:03:48.783
You're hopeless!

24
00:03:50.033 --> 00:03:50.992
I know.

25
00:03:52.908 --> 00:03:57.658
How about you take a photo of something else for
a change, and I'll grab us something for dinner?

26
00:03:58.158 --> 00:03:58.950
Fine.

27
00:03:59.658 --> 00:04:00.492
I'll be back.

28
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.075
Hey!

29
00:05:26.992 --> 00:05:27.867
Leave.

30
00:05:30.158 --> 00:05:31.450
Now!

31
00:05:49.658 --> 00:05:50.450
You ok?

32
00:05:50.742 --> 00:05:51.158
Yeah.

33
00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:53.158
I'm Traian.

34
00:05:53.992 --> 00:05:54.742
Hannah.

35
00:05:54.908 --> 00:05:55.575
Hannah?

36
00:05:55.867 --> 00:05:56.450
Yes.

37
00:05:57.284 --> 00:05:58.908
Pretty name for a pretty girl.

38
00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.575
Are you American?

39
00:06:01.908 --> 00:06:02.950
British actually.

40
00:06:03.575 --> 00:06:04.700
Ah, of course!

41
00:06:04.908 --> 00:06:05.992
How do you like my country?

42
00:06:06.284 --> 00:06:08.075
It's lovely, very peaceful.

43
00:06:08.658 --> 00:06:10.783
I could give you a little tour
if you like?

44
00:06:10.992 --> 00:06:12.992
I know all the best places,

45
00:06:13.575 --> 00:06:15.450
what to see, where to eat.

46
00:06:15.908 --> 00:06:19.783
No, it's ok actually,
my boyfriend's waiting outside for me.

47
00:06:20.283 --> 00:06:22.075
Boyfriend? What's his name?

48
00:06:22.575 --> 00:06:24.201
Look, I'd better be off,

49
00:06:24.783 --> 00:06:26.117
thanks again for your help.

50
00:06:26.783 --> 00:06:27.575
No problem.

51
00:06:29.658 --> 00:06:30.992
Perhaps we will...

52
00:06:31.575 --> 00:06:32.867
...see each other again?

53
00:06:35.283 --> 00:06:37.033
Yeah, maybe.

54
00:06:46.992 --> 00:06:48.075
Is everything alright?

55
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:49.117
Yeah,

56
00:06:49.658 --> 00:06:51.492
fine... honestly

57
00:06:51.908 --> 00:06:53.158
Nothing took your fancy then?

58
00:06:53.867 --> 00:06:54.367
No.

59
00:06:55.158 --> 00:06:56.783
Let's eat out, shall we?

60
00:06:56.992 --> 00:06:58.575
Yeah, I'm game if you are?

61
00:08:00.159 --> 00:08:00.742
OK

62
00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:02.742
Shut your eyes.

63
00:08:04.283 --> 00:08:05.242
Do it, do it!

64
00:08:12.783 --> 00:08:13.742
Ta-da!

65
00:08:16.283 --> 00:08:17.575
Open it then.

66
00:08:25.118 --> 00:08:26.283
It's beautiful.

67
00:08:27.867 --> 00:08:29.908
I though you might like it, it should
match the earrings your brother got you.

68
00:08:30.908 --> 00:08:32.908
It's perfect, thank you.

69
00:08:36.992 --> 00:08:38.076
Here's to us.

70
00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:45.700
It's good that!

71
00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.992
Sorry about earlier.

72
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.200
Sorry I was in such a rush to
get away from the supermarket.

73
00:08:53.908 --> 00:08:55.658
It was all a bit overwhelming.

74
00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:56.617
That's ok

75
00:08:57.658 --> 00:08:58.908
Everyone's first time abroad can
be a bit daunting.

76
00:08:58.950 --> 00:08:59.825
Oh, it's not that,

77
00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.825
my Ex and I went to Gran Canaria
last Summer.

78
00:09:03.283 --> 00:09:04.034
Oh, ok.

79
00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:07.700
It was more a case of too much
choice and not enough vocabulary.

80
00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:10.617
We've all been there.

81
00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:16.908
I remember Ian and I, we almost got arrested
because we couldn't read the signs at the beach.

82
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:18.617
What happened?

83
00:09:20.783 --> 00:09:22.283
Well, we were both...

84
00:09:26.825 --> 00:09:27.825
You were both?

85
00:09:30.742 --> 00:09:33.408
You know what... he was an
asshole,

86
00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:34.992
let's not talk about it.

87
00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.325
You can't just leave it there.

88
00:09:37.367 --> 00:09:39.825
Look, can we just leave it and
enjoy our evening?

89
00:09:41.242 --> 00:09:42.825
Yeah, of course.

90
00:09:43.825 --> 00:09:45.283
Ah, perfect timing!

91
00:09:45.325 --> 00:09:45.993
Thank you.

92
00:10:26.908 --> 00:10:28.158
They sound quite good.

93
00:10:29.408 --> 00:10:30.033
Yeah.

94
00:10:30.867 --> 00:10:32.117
Do you think we should join
them?

95
00:10:33.242 --> 00:10:34.200
Why not, huh?

96
00:13:31.533 --> 00:13:33.283
I can't believe that just
happened?

97
00:13:33.325 --> 00:13:34.616
I didn't know you could dance
like that.

98
00:13:34.658 --> 00:13:35.450
Neither did I!

99
00:14:21.158 --> 00:14:24.158
Hey, Traian.

100
00:14:34.075 --> 00:14:35.658
Who spat in your soup?

101
00:14:36.075 --> 00:14:37.617
Not tonight Tanya.

102
00:14:38.117 --> 00:14:39.408
I know this look...

103
00:14:40.075 --> 00:14:41.450
...only one thing on your mind.

104
00:14:41.492 --> 00:14:43.992
I said "not tonight".

105
00:14:52.158 --> 00:14:53.367
That's better.

106
00:15:06.492 --> 00:15:09.701
That was crazy, I've never done
anything like that before.

107
00:15:10.367 --> 00:15:11.158
Never?

108
00:15:12.158 --> 00:15:13.575
You looked like you were
enjoying it though?

109
00:15:13.617 --> 00:15:14.992
Absolutely!

110
00:15:19.492 --> 00:15:20.367
Umm...

111
00:15:20.825 --> 00:15:22.158
I tell you what...

112
00:15:23.867 --> 00:15:26.492
...why don't you head back to the cottage
and I'll meet you there in a few minutes?

113
00:15:27.617 --> 00:15:28.367
Well...

114
00:15:28.575 --> 00:15:29.200
I can if you want?

115
00:15:29.242 --> 00:15:30.659
Trust me, it'll be worth it.

116
00:15:33.367 --> 00:15:33.992
Alright.

117
00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:41.283
Go on!

118
00:16:00.533 --> 00:16:01.283
Hello.

119
00:16:24.618 --> 00:16:25.825
You like this one?

120
00:16:27.325 --> 00:16:27.825
Yeah.

121
00:16:28.492 --> 00:16:30.242
Ok, let me show you.

122
00:16:41.492 --> 00:16:43.325
You want brief or thong?

123
00:16:45.576 --> 00:16:47.117
What do you think?

124
00:16:52.408 --> 00:16:54.200
This is sexier, no?

125
00:16:54.492 --> 00:16:56.408
Yeah, very much so.

126
00:16:57.742 --> 00:16:59.200
Lucky girl!

127
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:04.700
Hannah?

128
00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.325
Just a sec...

129
00:18:36.408 --> 00:18:37.658
What's in the bag?

130
00:18:38.533 --> 00:18:39.533
Just...

131
00:18:40.493 --> 00:18:43.367
...a little 'something' to spice
things up.

132
00:18:49.408 --> 00:18:51.325
I'll wait here.

133
00:19:20.742 --> 00:19:22.367
Take off your dress.

134
00:19:47.617 --> 00:19:48.283
What's wrong?

135
00:19:49.492 --> 00:19:51.325
Are you sure this is really me?

136
00:19:51.367 --> 00:19:52.367
Yeah, of course.

137
00:19:54.451 --> 00:19:55.367
You don't like it?

138
00:19:56.242 --> 00:19:57.950
I'm grateful that you bought it
for me.

139
00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:00.325
I don't know what you want?

140
00:20:00.742 --> 00:20:02.325
I don't want anything.

141
00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:04.283
I mean it.

142
00:20:06.617 --> 00:20:08.991
Look, if you want me to wear
it...

143
00:20:09.033 --> 00:20:10.617
No, it's fine.

144
00:20:14.825 --> 00:20:15.950
Where are you going?

145
00:20:16.325 --> 00:20:16.867
For a walk.

146
00:20:17.325 --> 00:20:17.991
Shall I come with?

147
00:20:18.033 --> 00:20:19.450
No, I just need some air, OK?

148
00:20:20.742 --> 00:20:21.950
Well, be careful.

149
00:20:22.325 --> 00:20:22.825
Yeah.

150
00:20:30.617 --> 00:20:31.783
Matt wait!

151
00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:57.033
I'd hoped I would get a chance
to see you again.

152
00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.075
Oh... hi.

153
00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:04.950
I must admit I barely got a chance
to look at you in the supermarket.

154
00:22:05.992 --> 00:22:11.575
Pay no attention to those small-minded townsfolk,
they're always afraid of what they don't understand.

155
00:22:12.575 --> 00:22:13.158
Not you...

156
00:22:14.075 --> 00:22:15.700
...you're curious.

157
00:22:36.243 --> 00:22:38.575
So, I'm guessing you're not a
local then?

158
00:22:38.867 --> 00:22:40.950
I'm more of a local that you
are, no?

159
00:22:41.658 --> 00:22:42.158
True.

160
00:22:44.284 --> 00:22:45.492
My name is Eliska.

161
00:22:45.783 --> 00:22:46.700
I'm Hannah.

162
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:48.992
Please... take a seat Hannah

163
00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:50.117
Thank you.

164
00:22:50.617 --> 00:22:51.450
Something to drink?

165
00:22:52.867 --> 00:22:53.616
No, thank you.

166
00:22:53.658 --> 00:22:54.450
Mind if I?

167
00:22:54.492 --> 00:22:55.367
Oh yeah, go ahead.

168
00:22:58.158 --> 00:23:00.658
Where's that handsome man I saw
you with?

169
00:23:01.617 --> 00:23:02.658
I'm sorry?

170
00:23:03.825 --> 00:23:05.658
I saw the two of you earlier
leaving the bar together.

171
00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:06.992
Oh, I see.

172
00:23:07.783 --> 00:23:08.783
Well...

173
00:23:10.201 --> 00:23:13.575
To tell you the truth, I don't
know where he is... we had a fight.

174
00:23:14.783 --> 00:23:17.742
That's a shame, you make such a
picturesque couple.

175
00:23:18.158 --> 00:23:19.617
It's my fault.

176
00:23:20.075 --> 00:23:22.783
I keep getting hung up on stupid
little things.

177
00:23:24.325 --> 00:23:25.700
Hung up?

178
00:23:27.908 --> 00:23:31.992
I... have difficulty...

179
00:23:32.908 --> 00:23:36.492
...satisfying him in the
bedroom.

180
00:23:37.992 --> 00:23:38.617
Ah!

181
00:23:40.283 --> 00:23:42.033
Has he voiced concern?

182
00:23:42.075 --> 00:23:43.658
No, but...

183
00:23:44.159 --> 00:23:45.783
...I can tell it's an issue.

184
00:23:46.159 --> 00:23:47.950
You're an attractive girl?

185
00:23:47.992 --> 00:23:49.908
It's not that.

186
00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:52.492
It's more like...

187
00:23:55.283 --> 00:23:57.159
...it's more like he wants
this...

188
00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:00.991
That's fantasy!

189
00:24:01.033 --> 00:24:04.658
Surely I should go some way to
making it a reality?

190
00:24:05.783 --> 00:24:07.117
I am his girlfriend.

191
00:24:07.575 --> 00:24:09.075
So, what's the problem!?

192
00:24:09.783 --> 00:24:12.575
It's not that I don't want to do
certain things...

193
00:24:14.575 --> 00:24:20.575
...I've had a bad experience in the past and
it's taking me a while to feel confident again.

194
00:24:22.118 --> 00:24:24.283
If that's the case, then you
should be honest with him.

195
00:24:24.783 --> 00:24:25.992
I've tried but...

196
00:24:26.992 --> 00:24:27.992
...you know...

197
00:24:28.283 --> 00:24:30.283
...he'll think I'm being a
prude.

198
00:25:22.367 --> 00:25:28.408
There is something I can give to
help with your situation,

199
00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:30.617
but I wouldn't recommend it.

200
00:25:31.118 --> 00:25:32.117
Why not?

201
00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:36.825
The results can be...
unpredictable.

202
00:25:37.783 --> 00:25:40.783
Please, I just want him back.

203
00:25:46.825 --> 00:25:51.283
This will rid you of what you
consider to be your inhibitions,

204
00:25:58.117 --> 00:26:01.908
but you should only use it if you
are sure that is what you want.

205
00:26:25.993 --> 00:26:26.908
Where were you?

206
00:26:27.158 --> 00:26:28.658
I was looking for you.

207
00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:29.908
You knew I'd come back here.

208
00:26:30.993 --> 00:26:34.116
I wasn't sure, and besides, I
wanted to apologise.

209
00:26:34.158 --> 00:26:34.993
What for?

210
00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.742
For being a wimp.

211
00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:43.783
It's alright, I understand,
these things, they take time.

212
00:26:43.825 --> 00:26:46.075
But I don't want to disappoint
you.

213
00:26:46.783 --> 00:26:49.283
I just want you to feel wanted,
desired, you know?

214
00:26:49.533 --> 00:26:50.700
I do.

215
00:27:03.408 --> 00:27:06.825
Could you wait here a moment?

216
00:27:08.825 --> 00:27:10.200
I'll be back.

217
00:28:11.408 --> 00:28:12.783
What do you think?

218
00:29:42.575 --> 00:29:43.867
You alright?

219
00:29:45.658 --> 00:29:47.158
You OK?

220
00:29:48.075 --> 00:29:49.242
Give me a sec.

221
00:31:33.367 --> 00:31:35.616
Excuse me, do you speak English?

222
00:31:35.658 --> 00:31:36.950
Have you seen this girl?

223
00:31:58.492 --> 00:31:59.492
Excuse me...

224
00:32:01.367 --> 00:32:02.617
You OK friend?

225
00:32:03.367 --> 00:32:04.325
You speak English?

226
00:32:04.575 --> 00:32:05.325
Yes.

227
00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:08.283
Have you heard anything about an
English woman at all?

228
00:32:08.783 --> 00:32:12.033
Oh, you mean the dancing girl,
yes, she was here last night.

229
00:32:12.075 --> 00:32:13.659
I mean my 'girlfriend', have you
seen her?

230
00:32:14.325 --> 00:32:15.659
Yes, I've seen her.

231
00:32:16.158 --> 00:32:16.950
Where?

232
00:32:16.992 --> 00:32:19.158
At the supermarket yesterday
morning.

233
00:32:58.367 --> 00:32:59.283
What's wrong?

234
00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:02.492
Come with me.

235
00:33:10.117 --> 00:33:12.200
Alright witch, start talking.

236
00:33:12.242 --> 00:33:13.450
Have you finally gone mad
Traian?

237
00:33:13.492 --> 00:33:17.117
The girl that was with my friend
here, what have you done to her?

238
00:33:17.492 --> 00:33:20.075
That is between he and I, not
you.

239
00:33:20.825 --> 00:33:22.783
You try my patience.

240
00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:24.408
Then leave.

241
00:33:28.742 --> 00:33:30.075
Be careful.

242
00:33:36.117 --> 00:33:39.408
I would think long and hard before
letting him call you 'a friend'.

243
00:33:40.408 --> 00:33:44.242
Look, I'm not looking for any trouble,
I'm just looking for my girlfriend, OK?

244
00:33:44.867 --> 00:33:48.158
Some of the townsfolk told me
that she came here last night.

245
00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:48.783
She did.

246
00:33:50.492 --> 00:33:52.492
Please take a seat.

247
00:34:08.783 --> 00:34:09.700
Wait...

248
00:34:11.283 --> 00:34:13.450
...so Hannah consumed this stuff without
having any idea what it could do to her?

249
00:34:14.908 --> 00:34:17.200
She knew she would no longer be
worried about whether she pleases you.

250
00:34:17.492 --> 00:34:18.450
Is that what she told you?

251
00:34:19.492 --> 00:34:22.242
I just wanted her to open up for
her own sake.

252
00:34:22.492 --> 00:34:23.867
How noble of you!

253
00:34:24.783 --> 00:34:26.867
Look, just tell me where she is.

254
00:34:27.825 --> 00:34:30.825
I can't. I don't know.

255
00:34:38.908 --> 00:34:41.908
If you find her, give his this.

256
00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:50.200
It'll counteract whatever effect
the potion has taken.

257
00:34:52.617 --> 00:34:53.742
You better hope I find her.

258
00:34:55.325 --> 00:34:57.325
I sincerely hope you do.

259
00:35:04.408 --> 00:35:05.366
Any luck?

260
00:35:05.408 --> 00:35:06.158
Maybe.

261
00:35:06.575 --> 00:35:07.658
Well, what did she say?

262
00:35:09.534 --> 00:35:11.534
She said she'd given Hannah this
medicine.

263
00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:14.908
Medicine!? What kind of
medicine?

264
00:35:15.533 --> 00:35:17.533
I don't know. Why?

265
00:35:20.367 --> 00:35:21.742
Pay no attention to me.

266
00:35:23.325 --> 00:35:26.908
If I were you, I would look in the next
village along, beyond the woodland.

267
00:35:27.533 --> 00:35:30.617
She may have gone off exploring
on her own for a bit.

268
00:35:31.367 --> 00:35:31.867
Maybe.

269
00:35:32.825 --> 00:35:33.950
It's more that I deserve.

270
00:35:36.867 --> 00:35:40.451
I'll keep my ear to the ground
here, just in case she returns.

271
00:35:40.825 --> 00:35:45.533
And, if in the meantime you do find
her, you can always call me.

272
00:35:47.325 --> 00:35:51.200
If you stick to the main road
going out of town, going East...

273
00:35:51.575 --> 00:35:53.242
...you should get there
eventually.

274
00:35:53.742 --> 00:35:54.533
Alright.

275
00:35:55.033 --> 00:35:55.825
Thanks Traian.

276
00:35:56.867 --> 00:35:58.325
No problem my friend.

277
00:38:00.533 --> 00:38:01.867
It's OK...

278
00:38:07.783 --> 00:38:08.867
It's OK...

279
00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:26.700
Careful!

280
00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:31.950
Did you cut yourself?

281
00:39:31.867 --> 00:39:33.575
You must be hungry?

282
00:39:39.867 --> 00:39:41.492
I'll be back.

283
00:41:16.075 --> 00:41:17.075
No.

284
00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:19.700
No!

285
00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:24.200
I'm sorry, it's just... it's
been so long.

286
00:41:27.118 --> 00:41:28.283
Wait!

287
00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:35.992
Hannah...

288
00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:40.908
...it's me. It's Matt.

289
00:42:41.908 --> 00:42:42.950
Listen...

290
00:42:44.117 --> 00:42:46.658
You're sick, you're not well.

291
00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:49.658
I need to give you this
medicine.

292
00:42:51.408 --> 00:42:53.117
It'll make you better, OK?

293
00:42:54.325 --> 00:42:57.825
Just take this and we can go
back to how it was.

294
00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:12.117
Hannah!

295
00:43:18.408 --> 00:43:19.783
What the hell are you doing?

296
00:43:19.825 --> 00:43:20.951
Protecting her from men like
you.

297
00:43:20.993 --> 00:43:22.075
I'm her boyfriend!

298
00:43:22.117 --> 00:43:22.616
What?

299
00:43:22.658 --> 00:43:24.075
Her partner, her man.

300
00:43:24.117 --> 00:43:25.908
And you treat her like that!?

301
00:43:27.783 --> 00:43:28.158
Shit.

302
00:43:47.825 --> 00:43:48.408
A demon?

303
00:43:49.533 --> 00:43:51.825
I don't know, it's just...

304
00:43:53.117 --> 00:43:54.450
...that's what she looked like.

305
00:43:55.408 --> 00:43:56.367
Alright...

306
00:43:58.117 --> 00:44:01.200
Wait for me to call you
tomorrow. Sit tight, OK?

307
00:44:03.908 --> 00:44:04.408
Yes?

308
00:44:06.033 --> 00:44:06.825
OK.

309
00:44:19.867 --> 00:44:22.242
Meet me at the witch's shop in
ten minutes.

310
00:44:23.908 --> 00:44:24.742
Ladies.

311
00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:43.117
I'm sick of just sitting around.

312
00:44:43.533 --> 00:44:46.325
We'll never find her in
darkness, she's in her element.

313
00:44:47.325 --> 00:44:48.909
How could she be so stupid...

314
00:44:49.992 --> 00:44:51.283
...trusting that gypsy woman?

315
00:44:52.533 --> 00:44:53.992
You mean Eliska?

316
00:44:56.033 --> 00:44:57.450
The woman in the little shop.

317
00:44:58.158 --> 00:45:00.117
She tricked Hannah into taking
this drug and...

318
00:45:01.533 --> 00:45:03.533
...whatever it was, it turned
her into that thing.

319
00:45:07.033 --> 00:45:08.450
I think she's beautiful.

320
00:45:10.450 --> 00:45:11.325
Do you?

321
00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:15.450
You've got a strange idea of
beauty.

322
00:45:39.033 --> 00:45:40.825
Do you think she remembers who I
am?

323
00:45:42.242 --> 00:45:44.575
Does the butterfly remember
being...

324
00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:48.283
...a catapillar?

325
00:45:50.533 --> 00:45:51.868
I don't know.

326
00:46:05.533 --> 00:46:06.826
We'll find out.

327
00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:44.367
I thought I made it clear,
you're no longer welcome here.

328
00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:47.450
The Englishman said you cursed
his woman,

329
00:46:47.992 --> 00:46:49.242
I want to know why.

330
00:46:50.617 --> 00:46:52.200
Becasue she needs her eyes opened
to the fate that awaits her...

331
00:46:52.242 --> 00:46:55.200
...if she continues to submit to
people like you.

332
00:46:56.033 --> 00:46:59.533
Is that the same lie you told
yourself when Melina came to you?

333
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:03.242
Go to hell Traian.

334
00:47:04.158 --> 00:47:05.367
You first.

335
00:47:24.075 --> 00:47:25.575
Where are you going?

336
00:47:26.367 --> 00:47:27.658
To find that gypsy woman.

337
00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:29.575
Will you take coffee before you
go?

338
00:47:30.075 --> 00:47:31.075
No, I'm OK.

339
00:47:32.033 --> 00:47:34.200
If I find the potion, I'll give
you a call.

340
00:47:35.075 --> 00:47:38.033
With any luck, we can find
Hannah and make her better again.

341
00:47:38.743 --> 00:47:41.325
You think that is what is best
for her?

342
00:47:42.575 --> 00:47:43.950
Are you serious?

343
00:47:45.367 --> 00:47:46.950
She's sick and she's vulnerable.

344
00:47:47.283 --> 00:47:48.283
To whom?

345
00:47:49.158 --> 00:47:51.033
She made light work of you.

346
00:47:51.075 --> 00:47:52.075
To herself!

347
00:47:53.075 --> 00:47:53.950
Please...

348
00:47:54.283 --> 00:47:56.117
...just stay here.

349
00:47:57.283 --> 00:47:59.283
When I get back, we can look for
her together.

350
00:48:05.117 --> 00:48:05.950
Thank you.

351
00:48:26.825 --> 00:48:28.117
The Englishman?

352
00:48:30.783 --> 00:48:32.992
You want us to go after him?

353
00:48:36.283 --> 00:48:36.992
No.

354
00:48:37.783 --> 00:48:39.158
There's no point...

355
00:48:39.783 --> 00:48:41.492
...not until we have the girl.

356
00:48:43.158 --> 00:48:44.283
You, stay here...

357
00:48:44.783 --> 00:48:46.575
...we'll call you if we find
anything.

358
00:48:55.117 --> 00:48:57.075
Beware of the girl, Viktor.

359
00:49:21.492 --> 00:49:22.200
Hey.

360
00:49:23.492 --> 00:49:24.117
Hey.

361
00:49:24.783 --> 00:49:26.241
Nice to see a familiar face.

362
00:49:26.283 --> 00:49:27.283
Good morning.

363
00:49:27.325 --> 00:49:28.408
What are you doing here?

364
00:49:29.075 --> 00:49:30.783
Eliska wanted something from the
shop.

365
00:49:31.575 --> 00:49:32.200
Oh.

366
00:49:32.783 --> 00:49:34.492
It's not what you think!

367
00:49:34.825 --> 00:49:35.492
Are you...

368
00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:38.450
After you.

369
00:49:38.492 --> 00:49:39.117
Thank you.

370
00:49:41.117 --> 00:49:42.158
Eliska?

371
00:49:55.783 --> 00:49:56.742
Where is she?

372
00:49:57.742 --> 00:50:00.576
I don't know. She knew I would
be stopping by.

373
00:50:14.618 --> 00:50:17.408
What's the deal with you and
this Eliska woman anyway?

374
00:50:18.242 --> 00:50:18.700
Hmm?

375
00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:23.658
How come you're the only one not
prepared to give her the cold shoulder?

376
00:50:24.576 --> 00:50:26.116
The big guy... err...

377
00:50:26.158 --> 00:50:26.742
Traian...

378
00:50:27.283 --> 00:50:28.367
...he can't stand her.

379
00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:32.325
He says she's some kind of
witch.

380
00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:33.783
A witch!?

381
00:50:34.992 --> 00:50:37.117
To be perfectly honest, I'm
inclined to agree with him.

382
00:50:50.908 --> 00:50:52.783
I know this is going to sound
crazy, but...

383
00:50:53.617 --> 00:50:56.242
...I think she drugged Hannah.

384
00:50:56.617 --> 00:50:57.492
Hannah?

385
00:50:57.908 --> 00:50:59.117
My girlfriend.

386
00:50:59.908 --> 00:51:00.617
Here...

387
00:51:03.617 --> 00:51:04.617
Pretty.

388
00:51:06.867 --> 00:51:07.783
And...

389
00:51:08.867 --> 00:51:12.283
...is this the girl that you
bought the lingerie for?

390
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:13.617
Yeah.

391
00:51:15.242 --> 00:51:16.492
Did she like it?

392
00:51:17.450 --> 00:51:18.325
Eventually.

393
00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:19.908
Not at first.

394
00:51:21.325 --> 00:51:22.200
So...

395
00:51:22.825 --> 00:51:24.700
...you convinced her?

396
00:51:24.742 --> 00:51:25.617
Not quite.

397
00:51:26.575 --> 00:51:28.825
That Eliska woman, she gave her
this drug...

398
00:51:30.825 --> 00:51:32.700
Hannah must have taken it in the
bathroom?

399
00:51:34.325 --> 00:51:34.742
Shit.

400
00:51:37.242 --> 00:51:38.658
Why wouldn't she talk to me?

401
00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:40.825
Why wouldn't she consult me
before taking that?

402
00:51:41.450 --> 00:51:42.908
Some women need their armour...

403
00:51:43.534 --> 00:51:45.534
...and some feel trapped by it.

404
00:51:50.493 --> 00:51:51.493
I have to find her.

405
00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:56.200
I'll head out to the woods,
I'll go back to the cabin and find Codrin.

406
00:51:56.658 --> 00:51:57.617
You met Codrin?

407
00:51:58.908 --> 00:51:59.825
Yeah, why?

408
00:52:00.825 --> 00:52:03.408
You do know that him and Traian
are brothers?

409
00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:05.825
You could have fooled me.

410
00:52:07.242 --> 00:52:09.408
They used to be much closer,
but...

411
00:52:09.825 --> 00:52:11.867
...that was before Melina came
along.

412
00:52:36.617 --> 00:52:38.533
So, they fell out?

413
00:52:38.825 --> 00:52:40.242
Over her?

414
00:52:52.617 --> 00:52:55.617
Codrin worshipped the very
ground she walked on,

415
00:52:55.908 --> 00:52:59.325
while Traian saw her as the
ultimate trophy.

416
00:53:00.825 --> 00:53:02.617
It didn't matter though.

417
00:53:12.908 --> 00:53:14.617
She ran off with somebody else?

418
00:53:17.825 --> 00:53:19.450
She killed herself.

419
00:54:30.533 --> 00:54:31.326
Why?

420
00:54:35.658 --> 00:54:40.326
Traian believes that she was
poisoned by Eliska.

421
00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:41.867
And was she?

422
00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:44.367
Who can really say?

423
00:55:14.867 --> 00:55:15.617
Look...

424
00:55:17.075 --> 00:55:19.408
...if you got involved with Codrin,
Traian will know about it and...

425
00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:21.367
...he's a dangerous man.

426
00:55:21.742 --> 00:55:22.492
Seriously?

427
00:55:22.908 --> 00:55:24.075
Please, just trust me.

428
00:55:26.158 --> 00:55:27.616
You should call the police.

429
00:55:27.658 --> 00:55:28.783
I can't risk it.

430
00:55:30.242 --> 00:55:33.075
If anyone see's Hannah like I saw
her, they'll have her committed.

431
00:55:34.742 --> 00:55:37.783
Unless, of course, the authorities
really do believe that Eliska is a witch?

432
00:55:38.158 --> 00:55:39.867
How could anyone prove such a
thing?

433
00:55:40.158 --> 00:55:40.908
Exactly!

434
00:55:42.575 --> 00:55:43.450
OK, well...

435
00:55:44.658 --> 00:55:46.075
...good luck finding her.

436
00:55:46.908 --> 00:55:47.492
Thanks.

437
00:55:47.950 --> 00:55:49.158
Just be careful.

438
00:56:22.117 --> 00:56:28.492
You know, I never understood this little self-imposed
exile you went into after Melina's death,

439
00:56:29.867 --> 00:56:31.201
but I must say...

440
00:56:32.658 --> 00:56:36.159
...it seems to have provided the
perfect opportunity for her atonement.

441
00:56:36.201 --> 00:56:36.950
Traian...

442
00:56:38.617 --> 00:56:40.117
No, no, no.

443
00:56:44.867 --> 00:56:47.158
Get some rest, brother.

444
00:57:08.658 --> 00:57:10.867
Killing me won't bring Melina
back, Traian.

445
00:57:11.117 --> 00:57:13.492
I'm well aware of that, witch.

446
00:57:14.283 --> 00:57:17.492
I just want you to watch, while
I take what is owed me.

447
00:57:18.908 --> 00:57:20.117
Don't you touch her!

448
00:57:20.742 --> 00:57:21.825
Shut her up.

449
00:57:30.992 --> 00:57:31.908
Watch.

450
00:57:49.867 --> 00:57:52.075
There's no sport if they don't
fight back.

451
00:58:16.033 --> 00:58:16.742
Hello?

452
00:58:17.075 --> 00:58:18.283
Codrin, it's Matt.

453
00:58:19.408 --> 00:58:22.992
Matt, my old friend, I wondered
where you had got too.

454
00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:26.200
Traian.

455
00:58:26.867 --> 00:58:28.992
Yes. I'm afraid Codrin is...

456
00:58:29.783 --> 00:58:30.992
...incapacitated.

457
00:58:32.033 --> 00:58:33.118
Listen, Matt...

458
00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:36.908
I think I may have something
that belongs to you.

459
00:58:39.325 --> 00:58:40.617
Let me talk to her.

460
00:58:40.825 --> 00:58:41.783
Of course.

461
00:58:45.076 --> 00:58:45.992
Sweetie...

462
00:58:46.742 --> 00:58:47.658
...are you there?

463
00:58:48.076 --> 00:58:48.950
I'm coming straight to you...

464
00:58:49.742 --> 00:58:50.991
Traian, if you harm her I'll...

465
00:58:51.033 --> 00:58:51.950
You'll what?

466
00:58:56.117 --> 00:58:57.325
I'll be waiting.

467
00:59:09.408 --> 00:59:10.200
Well...

468
00:59:11.450 --> 00:59:13.617
...while we wait for the last
piece of our puzzle to arrive...

469
00:59:14.283 --> 00:59:16.992
...let's have a little fun, ay
boys?

470
00:59:28.658 --> 00:59:32.867
You western girls, you do insist
on putting yourselves on show.

471
00:59:48.993 --> 00:59:52.742
OK everybody, let's just relax,
shall we?

472
00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:56.366
Let her go, Traian.

473
00:59:56.408 --> 00:59:57.950
I can't do that, my friend.

474
00:59:58.325 --> 00:59:59.700
It's not an option,

475
00:59:59.993 --> 01:00:02.200
neither is letting you leave
here alive.

476
01:00:08.075 --> 01:00:12.993
This is no time for heroics, brother.
The blood in our veins only runs so thick.

477
01:00:14.908 --> 01:00:16.158
It's going to be OK Sweetie.

478
01:00:16.450 --> 01:00:17.783
Oh this?

479
01:00:17.825 --> 01:00:19.366
Are you talking to this!?

480
01:00:19.408 --> 01:00:22.200
This is NOT your girlfriend.

481
01:00:22.408 --> 01:00:26.908
You girlfriend died when she made
a deal with this Devil's Harlot!

482
01:00:28.033 --> 01:00:33.200
Now can everyone shut the fuck
up and watch me take my fill!?

483
01:00:33.408 --> 01:00:35.491
Don't fucking touch her you
bastard!

484
01:00:35.533 --> 01:00:36.825
Enough of this!

485
01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.367
It's no good Traian...

486
01:00:39.325 --> 01:00:40.867
...your fill has been had.

487
01:00:45.533 --> 01:00:47.117
What do you mean?

488
01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:52.993
When you found us by the
river...

489
01:00:55.033 --> 01:00:56.158
...you were too late.

490
01:00:58.367 --> 01:00:58.951
No.

491
01:01:00.033 --> 01:01:01.408
No, you're lying.

492
01:01:02.325 --> 01:01:04.325
When have I ever lied to you...

493
01:01:06.450 --> 01:01:07.075
...brother?

494
01:01:33.533 --> 01:01:35.033
Look at what you have done.

495
01:01:37.325 --> 01:01:39.950
Look at what YOU have done!

496
01:02:23.950 --> 01:02:24.533
Wait!

497
01:02:27.450 --> 01:02:28.325
Traian's right...

498
01:02:30.325 --> 01:02:31.325
...this is my fault.

499
01:02:34.033 --> 01:02:34.992
This isn't you.

500
01:02:37.242 --> 01:02:38.450
You're Hannah Stevenson.

501
01:02:39.533 --> 01:02:40.158
You're kind,

502
01:02:41.075 --> 01:02:42.575
the sweetest girl I've ever met.

503
01:02:45.450 --> 01:02:47.283
I'm so sorry for what I've done
to you,

504
01:02:48.533 --> 01:02:50.033
but let me make it right.

505
01:02:51.575 --> 01:02:52.033
So please...

506
01:02:53.533 --> 01:02:54.450
...I'm asking you...

507
01:02:56.325 --> 01:02:57.200
...let him go.

508
01:03:39.617 --> 01:03:42.325
Please, just let us go.

509
01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:55.367
You coward!

510
01:03:57.075 --> 01:03:59.908
Police! Put the gun down, put
your hands behind your head.

511
01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:02.242
I said "put down the gun".

512
01:04:15.575 --> 01:04:19.408
We've got one dead male, one
male two females, unarmed.

513
01:04:19.617 --> 01:04:21.158
Get him to the station.

514
01:04:21.617 --> 01:04:22.991
Listen, the girl, she's...

515
01:04:23.033 --> 01:04:23.866
Quiet!

516
01:04:23.908 --> 01:04:25.575
You don't understand, she's ill,
OK?

517
01:04:26.075 --> 01:04:27.075
She needs medicine.

518
01:04:27.367 --> 01:04:28.950
Please. Do you understand me?

519
01:04:30.408 --> 01:04:32.033
Can you understand what I'm saying?
She's ill, she's not safe, OK?

520
01:04:32.075 --> 01:04:32.575
Listen to me!

521
01:04:33.450 --> 01:04:34.992
She's not well, she needs
medicine.

522
01:05:19.783 --> 01:05:21.283
That's quite a story!

523
01:05:21.783 --> 01:05:22.492
It's true...

524
01:05:23.367 --> 01:05:24.158
...every word.

525
01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:31.158
I didn't think you'd believe me.

526
01:05:34.367 --> 01:05:36.575
Can you just tell me what
happened to Hannah?

527
01:05:36.783 --> 01:05:39.992
Your girlfriend is fine, Mr
Peters.

528
01:05:40.742 --> 01:05:46.325
She was discharged from the surgery, and is receiving
medical treatment back at your holiday cottage.

529
01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:52.283
Just do one more thing for me
please.

530
01:05:53.783 --> 01:05:59.325
Describe for me again Hannah's physical
appearance after having drunk the potion.

531
01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:03.200
It was horrible.

532
01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:05.700
She was really thin,

533
01:06:07.117 --> 01:06:10.075
and pale, and you could see her veins
through her skin as clear as day.

534
01:06:12.117 --> 01:06:13.200
But the worst part was her eyes,

535
01:06:15.618 --> 01:06:17.367
just really hollow and sore.

536
01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:23.659
You mean like this?

537
01:06:26.367 --> 01:06:27.158
Jesus!

538
01:06:32.908 --> 01:06:36.492
Thank you Mr Peters, you're free
to go.

539
01:06:57.492 --> 01:06:58.492
Mr Peters?

540
01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:00.533
Yeah, how is she?

541
01:07:01.283 --> 01:07:03.242
Your wife is asleep upstairs.

542
01:07:03.618 --> 01:07:05.116
She's not my wife actually.

543
01:07:05.158 --> 01:07:06.200
She's very weak,

544
01:07:07.450 --> 01:07:10.450
and will need to continue taking
steriods for another two days,

545
01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:11.283
OK.

546
01:07:13.283 --> 01:07:16.325
but she will be fine once you
return home.

547
01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:17.700
Thank you.

548
01:07:18.742 --> 01:07:19.617
Thank you very much.

549
01:08:02.325 --> 01:08:03.158
Hey Sweetie,

550
01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:06.158
how are you feeling?

551
01:08:07.617 --> 01:08:08.325
Sore.

552
01:08:13.408 --> 01:08:14.617
Do you remember much?

553
01:08:16.908 --> 01:08:17.534
Just...

554
01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:18.908
...sounds...

555
01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:20.700
...images.

556
01:08:22.408 --> 01:08:24.200
It was like a dream.

557
01:08:32.408 --> 01:08:33.783
When we were in the cabin,

558
01:08:34.908 --> 01:08:35.908
Codrin he...

559
01:08:37.867 --> 01:08:39.325
...he said you and him...

560
01:08:39.742 --> 01:08:41.533
That we...?

561
01:08:43.408 --> 01:08:44.408
It can wait.

562
01:08:45.950 --> 01:08:46.617
OK.

563
01:09:28.825 --> 01:09:32.617
Yeah, she's still pretty fatigued,
but she's getting better.

564
01:09:33.409 --> 01:09:35.658
Oh, that's really good.

565
01:09:37.409 --> 01:09:39.950
And you say that you're flying
home early?

566
01:09:40.409 --> 01:09:42.617
Yeah, today actually.

567
01:09:45.409 --> 01:09:47.283
I was wondering if...

568
01:09:47.325 --> 01:09:48.866
...you fancied coming to the
shop?

569
01:09:48.908 --> 01:09:50.992
You know, just to say goodbye?

570
01:09:52.492 --> 01:09:54.283
I normally would, but...

571
01:09:55.825 --> 01:09:57.783
...with Hannah and everything
it's just...

572
01:09:58.617 --> 01:10:01.575
Oh no no no, that's OK.

573
01:10:01.950 --> 01:10:03.867
That is very thoughtful of you
though.

574
01:10:04.533 --> 01:10:05.742
But, thank you.

575
01:10:06.367 --> 01:10:07.783
Thank you so much for your help.

576
01:10:08.450 --> 01:10:09.575
You're welcome,

577
01:10:09.825 --> 01:10:10.658
and...

578
01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:14.950
once again, sorry for going against
your wishes and informing the police.

579
01:10:15.533 --> 01:10:17.575
Probably the best decision
anyone's made!

580
01:10:18.617 --> 01:10:19.325
Thanks.
