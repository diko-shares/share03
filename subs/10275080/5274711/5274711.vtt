2
00:02:17.625 --> 00:02:18.898
You wanted virgins.

3
00:02:26.505 --> 00:02:28.673
Base, this is Phoenix One.

4
00:02:28.675 --> 00:02:30.304
I need extraction.

5
00:02:30.306 --> 00:02:31.549
Extraction for two?

6
00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:33.404
Extraction for one.

7
00:02:33.406 --> 00:02:35.713
Proceed to point beta.

8
00:03:04.204 --> 00:03:05.954
Time for you to go.

9
00:03:08.983 --> 00:03:09.983
Hey.

10
00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:14.526
Fuck.

11
00:03:15.625 --> 00:03:16.625
Fuck.

12
00:03:48.547 --> 00:03:50.674
Mitch, get up here.

13
00:03:50.676 --> 00:03:51.508
Yeah, I don't know.

14
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:52.843
Something's not right.

15
00:03:52.845 --> 00:03:54.869
I'm on my way.

16
00:03:54.871 --> 00:03:57.038
And get rid of the girl.

17
00:04:45.245 --> 00:04:47.113
Dr. Richardson.

18
00:04:47.115 --> 00:04:49.198
Hello, tonight we are three.

19
00:04:50.235 --> 00:04:51.235
Right this way.

20
00:05:10.705 --> 00:05:12.183
Shall I start you off with the usual?

21
00:05:12.185 --> 00:05:13.883
No, I'm celebrating.

22
00:05:13.885 --> 00:05:15.523
Tonight I will start with two bottles

23
00:05:15.525 --> 00:05:17.483
of your finest Cabernet Sauvignon

24
00:05:17.485 --> 00:05:19.873
and a tuna roll appetizer.

25
00:05:19.875 --> 00:05:24.173
Sir, the Cabernet Sauvignon
is a medium bodied red.

26
00:05:24.175 --> 00:05:26.553
I know what I want to order.

27
00:05:26.555 --> 00:05:27.698
Now shoo, fly.

28
00:05:28.615 --> 00:05:30.178
Of course, sir, right away.

29
00:06:01.375 --> 00:06:02.318
Focus.

30
00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.562
Pay attention.

31
00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:10.426
What?

32
00:06:13.075 --> 00:06:15.483
Malcolm's ready for your debriefing now.

33
00:06:15.485 --> 00:06:17.268
He's in his office waiting for you.

34
00:06:21.875 --> 00:06:22.875
Right.

35
00:06:36.245 --> 00:06:37.077
They are ready for you.

36
00:06:37.079 --> 00:06:38.123
Go on in.

37
00:06:38.125 --> 00:06:39.125
I was.

38
00:06:41.545 --> 00:06:43.648
Anyway, that's all she said.

39
00:06:44.625 --> 00:06:45.698
Black, come on in.

40
00:06:46.715 --> 00:06:48.913
I believe you've met Director Watson.

41
00:06:48.915 --> 00:06:49.746
Of course, sir.

42
00:06:49.748 --> 00:06:50.580
How are you?

43
00:06:50.582 --> 00:06:53.093
Well, Agent Black, I'd
be a hell of a lot better

44
00:06:53.095 --> 00:06:55.473
if I had some intel

45
00:06:55.475 --> 00:06:57.883
instead of a bunch of burned bodies

46
00:06:57.885 --> 00:07:00.213
and pissed off diplomats.

47
00:07:00.215 --> 00:07:01.047
They don't know we were there.

48
00:07:01.049 --> 00:07:02.526
I was very careful to make sure that...

49
00:07:02.528 --> 00:07:05.443
Goddamn sure know somebody was there,

50
00:07:05.445 --> 00:07:07.443
and as stupid as you may think they are,

51
00:07:07.445 --> 00:07:09.743
it doesn't take a fucking think tank

52
00:07:09.745 --> 00:07:11.803
to figure out it was probably us.

53
00:07:11.805 --> 00:07:15.518
And I didn't burn all
the bodies, exactly.

54
00:07:17.732 --> 00:07:18.863
Dammit, Malcolm.

55
00:07:18.865 --> 00:07:20.298
Black, this is serious.

56
00:07:21.565 --> 00:07:23.003
You don't understand the shit storm

57
00:07:23.005 --> 00:07:25.223
that rains down on us
from above every day.

58
00:07:25.225 --> 00:07:26.943
Things like this just add another layer

59
00:07:26.945 --> 00:07:29.460
of stink to the process.

60
00:07:29.462 --> 00:07:30.293
You're right.

61
00:07:30.295 --> 00:07:31.127
I'm sorry, sir.

62
00:07:31.129 --> 00:07:32.353
I don't mean to make
light of the situation,

63
00:07:32.355 --> 00:07:34.733
but there was no viable intel to gather.

64
00:07:34.735 --> 00:07:36.353
The situation got out of hand,

65
00:07:36.355 --> 00:07:37.913
and I made a decision.

66
00:07:37.915 --> 00:07:38.915
I still stand by it.

67
00:07:40.235 --> 00:07:42.185
Look, Malcolm, this is your division.

68
00:07:43.195 --> 00:07:44.703
You do what you want with this thing,

69
00:07:44.705 --> 00:07:47.583
but don't let it come back on me,

70
00:07:47.585 --> 00:07:49.303
or I'll have your ass.

71
00:07:49.305 --> 00:07:50.154
Don't worry, sir.

72
00:07:50.156 --> 00:07:51.338
Don't fucking worry,

73
00:07:52.405 --> 00:07:53.603
and you'd better not come back

74
00:07:53.605 --> 00:07:55.273
with a handful of air this next time.

75
00:07:55.275 --> 00:07:57.477
No, sir, of course not.

76
00:08:10.505 --> 00:08:12.423
Jade, what the hell were you thinking?

77
00:08:12.425 --> 00:08:14.473
I was thinking we were better off

78
00:08:14.475 --> 00:08:16.348
with me alive and them not.

79
00:08:17.345 --> 00:08:18.393
You know better than anyone

80
00:08:18.395 --> 00:08:19.473
that I'm not afraid to die,

81
00:08:19.475 --> 00:08:21.475
but what purpose would that have served?

82
00:08:22.785 --> 00:08:23.853
They were nothing to us,

83
00:08:23.855 --> 00:08:25.805
and they had nothing of value to offer,

84
00:08:27.445 --> 00:08:29.423
and seriously, Malcolm,

85
00:08:29.425 --> 00:08:31.263
what the hell were you thinking?

86
00:08:31.265 --> 00:08:32.833
A compound full of pedophiles,

87
00:08:32.835 --> 00:08:34.418
and you pick me to send in?

88
00:08:35.995 --> 00:08:37.353
Why would you do that?

89
00:08:37.355 --> 00:08:39.137
What did you expect?

90
00:08:39.139 --> 00:08:40.813
I expected you to be a professional

91
00:08:40.815 --> 00:08:41.807
and remember your training.

92
00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:43.543
That means all of your training

93
00:08:43.545 --> 00:08:45.708
and not just the assassination programs.

94
00:08:48.595 --> 00:08:52.763
You were chosen because
you knew what to look for,

95
00:08:52.765 --> 00:08:54.403
what information to extract,

96
00:08:54.405 --> 00:08:55.733
and how to extract it,

97
00:08:55.735 --> 00:08:58.758
not because we needed some
goddamn angel of vengeance.

98
00:09:05.025 --> 00:09:06.295
I taught you that.

99
00:09:09.595 --> 00:09:10.494
I'm sorry.

100
00:09:10.496 --> 00:09:13.132
I don't know what you want me to say.

101
00:09:13.134 --> 00:09:14.717
I want you to say

102
00:09:15.678 --> 00:09:17.378
that you see the big picture,

103
00:09:18.235 --> 00:09:20.698
that you understand that we are a team.

104
00:09:23.135 --> 00:09:24.523
I need to be able to trust you,

105
00:09:24.525 --> 00:09:27.693
that you won't take matters
into your own hands, Jade.

106
00:09:27.695 --> 00:09:29.958
I made the best decision
I could at the time.

107
00:09:36.405 --> 00:09:37.237
We're not done with this yet,

108
00:09:37.239 --> 00:09:40.373
but for now I have a
different operation for you.

109
00:09:40.375 --> 00:09:41.207
Let's move on to that,

110
00:09:41.209 --> 00:09:43.003
and we can talk more when you get back.

111
00:09:43.005 --> 00:09:44.068
Get back from where?

112
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:44.994
England.

113
00:09:44.996 --> 00:09:47.503
There is a chemist by
the name of Concotilli

114
00:09:47.505 --> 00:09:49.473
who claims to have some information

115
00:09:49.475 --> 00:09:50.733
and is asking for asylum.

116
00:09:50.735 --> 00:09:54.483
I don't know exactly why or
for what he needs asylum,

117
00:09:54.485 --> 00:09:57.843
but this comes directly
from Watt's office,

118
00:09:57.845 --> 00:09:59.495
so let's get it done immediately.

119
00:10:00.454 --> 00:10:02.033
Okay, I'll leave first thing tomorrow.

120
00:10:02.035 --> 00:10:04.403
Actually, you're leaving tonight.

121
00:10:04.405 --> 00:10:06.373
That file of information Jennifer gave you

122
00:10:06.375 --> 00:10:09.273
on the way in is everything
we have on Concotilli.

123
00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:11.253
Your contact on the ground there, Roan,

124
00:10:11.255 --> 00:10:13.063
will be coming back with you.

125
00:10:13.065 --> 00:10:16.763
You'll have plenty of time
to study that in transit.

126
00:10:16.765 --> 00:10:19.323
Right now, I need you to get over

127
00:10:19.325 --> 00:10:22.398
to Ty's and pick up your
travel docs and plane tickets,

128
00:10:25.971 --> 00:10:26.971
and Jade?

129
00:10:29.965 --> 00:10:32.343
Let's try not to have
the Italian ambassador

130
00:10:32.345 --> 00:10:35.938
up my ass by the time you get back, pleas?

131
00:10:36.905 --> 00:10:37.905
Sure.

132
00:10:53.335 --> 00:10:55.013
Hey, Black.

133
00:10:55.015 --> 00:10:57.823
Hey, Ty, what you working on?

134
00:10:57.825 --> 00:10:58.843
Trying to calculate

135
00:10:58.845 --> 00:11:02.163
the absolute maximum
chamber pressure exactly

136
00:11:02.165 --> 00:11:05.293
so I can reduce weight by
shaving the outer walls

137
00:11:05.295 --> 00:11:07.113
and then replace the recoil spring

138
00:11:07.115 --> 00:11:09.043
with a stiffer but lighter titanium

139
00:11:09.045 --> 00:11:10.083
and polymer hybrid.

140
00:11:10.085 --> 00:11:12.653
I should be able to
simultaneously reduce weight

141
00:11:12.655 --> 00:11:16.333
and recoil without jeopardizing
reliability or gripping.

142
00:11:16.335 --> 00:11:17.335
So?

143
00:11:18.295 --> 00:11:21.283
You can shoot it
accurately with one hand.

144
00:11:21.285 --> 00:11:22.285
Lovely.

145
00:11:23.165 --> 00:11:24.743
Sadly, I don't
think they'll let you

146
00:11:24.745 --> 00:11:27.493
put it in the overhead on
an international flight.

147
00:11:27.495 --> 00:11:28.753
No, probably not.

148
00:11:28.755 --> 00:11:31.853
Ah, and I have something else for you.

149
00:11:31.855 --> 00:11:32.686
Oh, yeah?

150
00:11:32.688 --> 00:11:33.574
And what's that?

151
00:11:38.765 --> 00:11:40.913
Oh, Ty, you shouldn't have.

152
00:11:40.915 --> 00:11:43.708
No, probably not, but still here we are.

153
00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:47.113
Jesus.

154
00:11:47.115 --> 00:11:49.643
This thing is the size of a Buick.

155
00:11:49.645 --> 00:11:52.123
How am I supposed to swallow this?

156
00:11:52.125 --> 00:11:53.125
Wait a minute.

157
00:11:54.145 --> 00:11:56.666
I am supposed to swallow this, right?

158
00:11:56.668 --> 00:11:57.668
Yes, yes.

159
00:12:00.155 --> 00:12:01.383
What is it anyway?

160
00:12:01.385 --> 00:12:02.503
I'm just going to Italy,

161
00:12:02.505 --> 00:12:04.418
and I've already had all my shots.

162
00:12:05.825 --> 00:12:07.613
It's based on nanotechnology

163
00:12:07.615 --> 00:12:08.723
that enters your bloodstream

164
00:12:08.725 --> 00:12:11.863
and emits a harmless but detectable signal

165
00:12:11.865 --> 00:12:14.683
that has a specific
frequency for each agent.

166
00:12:14.685 --> 00:12:16.193
We get it via satellite,

167
00:12:16.195 --> 00:12:18.674
much more reliable than 4G.

168
00:12:20.835 --> 00:12:21.978
Oh, that is rough.

169
00:12:30.805 --> 00:12:31.764
Both?

170
00:12:31.766 --> 00:12:33.343
No, it's for Roan

171
00:12:33.345 --> 00:12:34.177
as soon as you get there,

172
00:12:34.179 --> 00:12:36.488
which will be tomorrow
if you make your flight.

173
00:12:42.135 --> 00:12:44.408
It's not polite to stare, Ty.

174
00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:50.623
seven, seven ,

175
00:12:50.625 --> 00:12:53.036
please make your way to
for boarding.

176
00:12:53.038 --> 00:12:58.038
To all passengers
seven seven.

177
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:13.470
Johnson.

178
00:13:14.157 --> 00:13:15.663
Virginia.

179
00:13:15.665 --> 00:13:17.815
Now that the silliness
is over, let's go.

180
00:13:20.275 --> 00:13:21.275
A Prius.

181
00:13:22.525 --> 00:13:23.525
It's a rental.

182
00:13:26.476 --> 00:13:28.303
It's gonna take a little time.

183
00:13:28.305 --> 00:13:30.153
He's in a house out in the countryside.

184
00:13:30.155 --> 00:13:31.303
Fine.

185
00:13:31.305 --> 00:13:34.413
Oh, yeah, take this.

186
00:13:34.415 --> 00:13:35.433
Damn.

187
00:13:35.435 --> 00:13:36.267
Yeah.

188
00:13:36.269 --> 00:13:37.944
Oh, I got a gift for you too.

189
00:13:37.946 --> 00:13:38.963
Here you go,

190
00:13:38.965 --> 00:13:40.578
although hardly a fair trade.

191
00:13:41.642 --> 00:13:43.103
Perfect.

192
00:15:47.245 --> 00:15:49.348
I knew eventually someone would come.

193
00:15:50.655 --> 00:15:52.363
We're not here to kill you.

194
00:15:52.365 --> 00:15:54.315
We're here to take you back to America.

195
00:15:58.571 --> 00:16:00.099
This is all my research.

196
00:16:01.125 --> 00:16:02.653
This is what they're afraid of,

197
00:16:02.655 --> 00:16:04.305
the one thing that can stop them.

198
00:16:05.145 --> 00:16:08.152
That idiot Richardson
wouldn't keep his mouth shut.

199
00:16:13.605 --> 00:16:15.073
Who else is here?

200
00:16:15.075 --> 00:16:16.513
We're alone.

201
00:16:16.515 --> 00:16:18.915
I sent my wife and son
to her family in Tuscany.

202
00:16:20.115 --> 00:16:21.315
I couldn't tell her why.

203
00:16:23.105 --> 00:16:24.393
Just leave those.

204
00:16:24.395 --> 00:16:26.144
You just need your laptop.

205
00:16:27.062 --> 00:16:27.942
Go, go.

206
00:16:31.055 --> 00:16:32.755
Get him out of here.

207
00:17:23.635 --> 00:17:24.635
Jade Black.

208
00:17:36.135 --> 00:17:37.135
I'm not ready.

209
00:17:38.091 --> 00:17:38.922
What?

210
00:17:38.924 --> 00:17:39.756
What are you talking about?

211
00:17:39.758 --> 00:17:41.282
We got to get the hell out of here.

212
00:17:41.284 --> 00:17:42.284
He may not be alone.

213
00:17:43.205 --> 00:17:44.205
He's hit.

214
00:17:45.485 --> 00:17:46.485
Dammit.

215
00:17:50.315 --> 00:17:52.173
I know a safe place we can go.

216
00:17:52.175 --> 00:17:53.890
Can't stay very long though.

217
00:18:06.701 --> 00:18:07.533
I would have liked

218
00:18:07.535 --> 00:18:09.883
to have seen my family one more time.

219
00:18:09.885 --> 00:18:11.968
No, man, you're gonna see them again.

220
00:18:15.585 --> 00:18:16.585
Kind boy.

221
00:18:17.475 --> 00:18:21.353
Dr. Concotelli, I have
to ask you a few questions.

222
00:18:21.355 --> 00:18:23.943
We need to understand what exactly it is

223
00:18:23.945 --> 00:18:25.143
that you have that they want

224
00:18:25.145 --> 00:18:26.145
and who's after you.

225
00:18:28.255 --> 00:18:29.255
It's all in here.

226
00:18:40.057 --> 00:18:41.453
It's password protected.

227
00:18:41.455 --> 00:18:42.455
What's the password?

228
00:18:44.103 --> 00:18:45.103
Juliet, it's Juliet.

229
00:18:49.505 --> 00:18:51.493
Okay, so what exactly am I supposed

230
00:18:51.495 --> 00:18:52.495
to be looking for?

231
00:18:54.895 --> 00:18:55.958
Dr. Concotilli.

232
00:19:07.935 --> 00:19:09.385
Do you have someone for this?

233
00:19:11.845 --> 00:19:13.123
Yes.

234
00:19:13.125 --> 00:19:15.133
Okay, leave it.

235
00:19:15.135 --> 00:19:16.135
Make the call.

236
00:19:17.065 --> 00:19:18.065
Let's go.

237
00:19:32.168 --> 00:19:32.999
This is Black.

238
00:19:33.001 --> 00:19:34.001
Put me through.

239
00:19:36.045 --> 00:19:38.403
Malcolm, I'm with Roan.

240
00:19:38.405 --> 00:19:40.713
We're coming in.

241
00:19:40.715 --> 00:19:43.623
No, he didn't make it.

242
00:19:43.625 --> 00:19:44.625
It was Haydn.

243
00:19:47.755 --> 00:19:49.955
Absolutely, I was
standing 10 feet from him.

244
00:19:51.695 --> 00:19:52.793
Look, I have the laptop,

245
00:19:52.795 --> 00:19:54.970
but I just sent you some
info I pulled from it.

246
00:19:54.972 --> 00:19:56.173
Can you send it to Ty

247
00:19:56.175 --> 00:19:57.375
and have him work on it?

248
00:19:58.335 --> 00:20:00.143
It's mostly just chemical

249
00:20:00.145 --> 00:20:01.638
and mathematical equations,

250
00:20:02.645 --> 00:20:04.508
but there's a list of names.

251
00:20:07.277 --> 00:20:08.277
Yes, sir.

252
00:20:10.375 --> 00:20:11.675
I'll be there by tomorrow.

253
00:20:15.205 --> 00:20:16.455
What's going on, Black?

254
00:20:17.294 --> 00:20:19.093
This was supposed to be
some simple babysitting job

255
00:20:19.095 --> 00:20:20.728
on my way back to the States.

256
00:20:22.285 --> 00:20:23.785
Who the hell was that shooter?

257
00:20:25.645 --> 00:20:26.645
His name's Haydn.

258
00:20:28.365 --> 00:20:29.573
Well, who is he?

259
00:20:29.575 --> 00:20:32.578
I mean, who does he work for?

260
00:20:33.465 --> 00:20:35.003
He's a ghost,

261
00:20:35.005 --> 00:20:37.703
and he works for whoever
has the biggest bank account

262
00:20:37.705 --> 00:20:38.705
at the moment.

263
00:20:40.365 --> 00:20:41.865
Occasionally that includes us.

264
00:21:02.185 --> 00:21:03.185
Who's this?

265
00:21:04.635 --> 00:21:06.048
That's Daniel Hawthorne.

266
00:21:10.825 --> 00:21:12.423
Okay.

267
00:21:12.425 --> 00:21:13.825
We don't have much on him.

268
00:21:15.335 --> 00:21:17.513
His name has come up a time or two

269
00:21:17.515 --> 00:21:20.133
in our investigation into
the sex trafficking trade,

270
00:21:20.135 --> 00:21:21.698
but nothing solid.

271
00:21:23.095 --> 00:21:24.595
We don't know if he's a buyer,

272
00:21:25.465 --> 00:21:28.723
a provider, a transporter, or what,

273
00:21:28.725 --> 00:21:29.903
but we do know that he's a member

274
00:21:29.905 --> 00:21:33.308
of an international business
group called Darrian,

275
00:21:34.195 --> 00:21:36.533
and they're having a
networking event tonight

276
00:21:36.535 --> 00:21:37.635
at the Metro Ballroom.

277
00:21:38.925 --> 00:21:40.783
Okay, so why the sudden interest

278
00:21:40.785 --> 00:21:42.385
if he's not really on our radar?

279
00:21:44.035 --> 00:21:45.923
His name was on that list

280
00:21:45.925 --> 00:21:48.038
you got from Concotilli's computer.

281
00:21:51.135 --> 00:21:53.583
Okay, then, evening gown?

282
00:21:53.585 --> 00:21:56.298
Yes, but be discreet.

283
00:21:57.145 --> 00:21:58.153
Find out whatever you can

284
00:21:58.155 --> 00:22:01.173
without letting anybody
know that you're asking.

285
00:22:01.175 --> 00:22:03.093
You'll stand out if you're unescorted,

286
00:22:03.095 --> 00:22:05.933
so Roan will go with you.

287
00:22:05.935 --> 00:22:07.238
He'll be fine.

288
00:22:08.855 --> 00:22:10.463
He's already familiar with the operation,

289
00:22:10.465 --> 00:22:12.115
so he'll see it through with you,

290
00:22:15.615 --> 00:22:16.615
and Jade?

291
00:22:18.655 --> 00:22:20.588
Exercise caution please.

292
00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:24.548
We don't know what we don't
know about this group.

293
00:22:47.925 --> 00:22:49.063
I'll find Hawthorne.

294
00:22:49.065 --> 00:22:51.258
You just listen to the room.

295
00:22:52.965 --> 00:22:54.273
You do realize I'm trained

296
00:22:54.275 --> 00:22:56.553
at information gathering as well.

297
00:22:56.555 --> 00:22:59.408
Yeah, that's what worries me.

298
00:24:05.445 --> 00:24:07.613
Are these always this dull?

299
00:24:07.615 --> 00:24:10.551
Well, the Rolling Stones
had to cancel tonight.

300
00:24:10.553 --> 00:24:11.553
Oh, tragic.

301
00:24:12.754 --> 00:24:15.369
Well, the party's not
over till it's ended.

302
00:24:15.371 --> 00:24:16.371
Oh.

303
00:24:17.305 --> 00:24:18.393
Daniel Hawthorne.

304
00:24:18.395 --> 00:24:19.893
Jade Black.

305
00:24:19.895 --> 00:24:21.833
Did you come alone, Mrs. Black?

306
00:24:21.835 --> 00:24:22.963
Of course not,

307
00:24:22.965 --> 00:24:23.965
and it's miss.

308
00:24:25.455 --> 00:24:26.705
Where's your date then?

309
00:24:27.595 --> 00:24:28.863
He ditched me.

310
00:24:28.865 --> 00:24:30.973
He's off shaking hands and kissing ass

311
00:24:30.975 --> 00:24:32.475
on some business deal.

312
00:24:35.924 --> 00:24:38.723
Well, here's to due diligence then.

313
00:24:45.728 --> 00:24:47.978
I have a VIP room upstairs.

314
00:24:48.868 --> 00:24:49.988
Would you like to see it?

315
00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:56.480
Show me.

316
00:25:26.517 --> 00:25:29.985
So what do you do, Mr. Hawthorne?

317
00:25:39.905 --> 00:25:41.405
Whatever I like, Miss Black.

318
00:26:10.635 --> 00:26:11.953
See what you can learn from him.

319
00:26:11.955 --> 00:26:13.443
Report to me tomorrow.

320
00:26:13.445 --> 00:26:14.595
This one stays with me.

321
00:26:58.335 --> 00:26:59.335
Hawthorne.

322
00:27:01.385 --> 00:27:04.173
If we don't play nice with our guests,

323
00:27:04.175 --> 00:27:06.748
they're not gonna want to
have a conversation with us.

324
00:27:07.605 --> 00:27:09.005
Please try to remember that,

325
00:27:11.455 --> 00:27:13.483
and she's one of Malcolm's girls.

326
00:27:13.485 --> 00:27:15.293
You do not want to be standing that close.

327
00:27:15.295 --> 00:27:16.295
I promise you,

328
00:27:25.425 --> 00:27:28.398
so you would be Jade Black then.

329
00:27:32.625 --> 00:27:34.113
I'm Elle.

330
00:27:34.115 --> 00:27:35.515
I assume you've heard of me.

331
00:27:39.745 --> 00:27:40.745
Okay.

332
00:27:47.645 --> 00:27:49.698
I apologize for the accommodations,

333
00:27:51.105 --> 00:27:54.483
but I find it much easier
to remain low key and mobile

334
00:27:54.485 --> 00:27:56.628
with more modest surroundings.

335
00:27:58.655 --> 00:28:00.355
I trust that you had a deep sleep.

336
00:28:03.045 --> 00:28:03.877
Don't worry.

337
00:28:03.879 --> 00:28:05.058
The headache and fogginess,

338
00:28:06.205 --> 00:28:08.083
it'll only last a couple more hours,

339
00:28:08.085 --> 00:28:10.003
just long enough for us to develop

340
00:28:10.005 --> 00:28:12.138
a more intimate acquaintance.

341
00:28:14.835 --> 00:28:15.835
Oh.

342
00:28:22.915 --> 00:28:25.838
Men can be so brutish
when they're passionate,

343
00:28:27.815 --> 00:28:29.065
but of course, you and I,

344
00:28:30.085 --> 00:28:31.313
we know that better than most,

345
00:28:31.315 --> 00:28:32.315
don't we, love?

346
00:28:35.425 --> 00:28:38.283
Oh, of course.

347
00:28:38.285 --> 00:28:39.463
Not to worry.

348
00:28:39.465 --> 00:28:41.075
The metal roof and framing

349
00:28:42.005 --> 00:28:45.503
guarantees that Ty's little gadgets

350
00:28:45.505 --> 00:28:48.358
will be confused and slow
to read your signature,

351
00:28:49.605 --> 00:28:50.803
so we have plenty of time

352
00:28:50.805 --> 00:28:52.598
for uninterrupted conversation.

353
00:28:54.565 --> 00:28:55.565
Who are you?

354
00:28:56.395 --> 00:28:57.293
I told you.

355
00:28:57.295 --> 00:28:58.295
I'm Elle.

356
00:28:59.215 --> 00:29:01.468
I was you before you were you.

357
00:29:04.695 --> 00:29:05.998
I was Malcolm's favorite,

358
00:29:07.185 --> 00:29:08.588
the first, in fact.

359
00:29:09.535 --> 00:29:11.388
Yes, I'm sure it's a bit confusing,

360
00:29:12.535 --> 00:29:14.073
but don't worry.

361
00:29:14.075 --> 00:29:16.223
It will all become a bit
more clear in a few hours

362
00:29:16.225 --> 00:29:17.675
when the drugs subside a bit.

363
00:29:40.685 --> 00:29:43.413
Now, Miss Black,

364
00:29:43.415 --> 00:29:46.528
what I need from you is some
very simple information.

365
00:29:48.125 --> 00:29:49.773
I'm aware that I need no longer worry

366
00:29:49.775 --> 00:29:51.078
about Dr. Concotilli,

367
00:29:53.085 --> 00:29:54.993
and of course Dr. Richardson was removed

368
00:29:54.995 --> 00:29:56.638
from the equation weeks ago.

369
00:30:00.495 --> 00:30:02.328
What I don't know is,

370
00:30:03.565 --> 00:30:05.365
did Concotilli have time

371
00:30:06.515 --> 00:30:08.088
to give you the formula,

372
00:30:09.205 --> 00:30:10.898
and more importantly,

373
00:30:12.085 --> 00:30:15.370
has it been passed along
to Director Watts yet?

374
00:30:23.545 --> 00:30:26.205
I am offering you an opportunity

375
00:30:27.065 --> 00:30:29.238
that you clearly don't appreciate.

376
00:30:32.045 --> 00:30:34.493
Right now, you're awake

377
00:30:34.495 --> 00:30:36.088
and able to speak freely,

378
00:30:38.125 --> 00:30:40.513
and I'm willing to give you truths

379
00:30:40.515 --> 00:30:43.768
in exchange for some
basic yes or no answers,

380
00:30:45.125 --> 00:30:47.573
and if you don't want to see that,

381
00:30:47.575 --> 00:30:49.423
we can do this Hawthorne's way,

382
00:30:49.425 --> 00:30:51.625
which I assure you will
be much more primal.

383
00:30:53.606 --> 00:30:54.606
What?

384
00:30:56.708 --> 00:30:57.708
What truths?

385
00:31:17.545 --> 00:31:21.113
A truth that only someone

386
00:31:21.115 --> 00:31:23.578
like you or I could truly understand,

387
00:31:25.005 --> 00:31:27.808
it's about retribution and recompense.

388
00:31:29.855 --> 00:31:31.098
What are you talking about?

389
00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:34.113
No, no, no,

390
00:31:34.115 --> 00:31:36.433
quid pro quo, Jade.

391
00:31:36.435 --> 00:31:37.938
Tell me.

392
00:31:38.889 --> 00:31:41.039
We know all about
your biological weapon.

393
00:31:44.365 --> 00:31:45.443
Of course you do.

394
00:31:45.445 --> 00:31:46.468
Don't insult me.

395
00:31:47.515 --> 00:31:49.398
Juliet is not the weapon.

396
00:31:50.445 --> 00:31:53.243
I am dropping poison bait

397
00:31:53.245 --> 00:31:56.223
into the middle of a rat colony.

398
00:31:56.225 --> 00:31:58.713
Who would want to stop me

399
00:31:58.715 --> 00:31:59.715
besides the rats?

400
00:32:02.525 --> 00:32:04.343
Enough of this crap.

401
00:32:04.345 --> 00:32:05.848
She's not giving us anything.

402
00:32:19.206 --> 00:32:20.206
Jade, Jade, Jade,

403
00:32:25.585 --> 00:32:28.845
Malcolm acquired me

404
00:32:30.425 --> 00:32:31.985
the same way he did you.

405
00:32:36.765 --> 00:32:40.015
The rats have fed on us both.

406
00:32:45.225 --> 00:32:47.528
Don't we deserve their atonement?

407
00:33:18.435 --> 00:33:22.495
I'm gonna need more than just
a couple yes or no answers.

408
00:33:25.589 --> 00:33:26.484
Now I'd like you to take

409
00:33:26.486 --> 00:33:28.326
as much time as you'd
like in giving them to me

410
00:33:31.065 --> 00:33:33.728
so we can fully enjoy the process.

411
00:35:46.555 --> 00:35:47.555
Ty, it's Jade.

412
00:35:48.625 --> 00:35:53.083
Dammit, Ty, alpha,
yankee, niner, one, niner.

413
00:35:53.085 --> 00:35:54.593
Meet me at the safe house on East 23rd,

414
00:35:54.595 --> 00:35:55.595
and bring hardware.

415
00:35:56.395 --> 00:35:57.605
As soon as I lose them.

416
00:38:45.978 --> 00:38:47.168
Are you okay?

417
00:38:48.325 --> 00:38:49.353
Still a little loopy

418
00:38:49.355 --> 00:38:50.743
from the drugs that they gave me,

419
00:38:50.745 --> 00:38:53.053
but I'm functioning.

420
00:38:53.055 --> 00:38:54.055
Obviously.

421
00:38:57.635 --> 00:38:58.635
Tell me.

422
00:39:02.935 --> 00:39:03.935
Who is Elle?

423
00:39:08.204 --> 00:39:09.204
Holy shit.

424
00:39:15.235 --> 00:39:16.685
Jade, how was Elle connected?

425
00:39:17.655 --> 00:39:19.393
I think Hawthorne works for her,

426
00:39:19.395 --> 00:39:22.328
or at least they're working
together on something,

427
00:39:24.715 --> 00:39:25.878
so who the hell is she?

428
00:39:27.105 --> 00:39:29.838
Intelligent, insane,

429
00:39:31.405 --> 00:39:32.533
dangerous.

430
00:39:32.535 --> 00:39:35.503
She was one of the very first
recruited into this program

431
00:39:35.505 --> 00:39:36.718
and well suited for it.

432
00:39:38.375 --> 00:39:39.975
She couldn't let go of her past.

433
00:39:40.835 --> 00:39:42.493
She eventually had to be pulled

434
00:39:42.495 --> 00:39:45.793
from the field and institutionalized.

435
00:39:45.795 --> 00:39:47.703
If we could find a facility

436
00:39:47.705 --> 00:39:48.973
that would hold her.

437
00:39:48.975 --> 00:39:53.478
She vanished from a high
security ward six years ago,

438
00:39:54.435 --> 00:39:56.483
and no one's heard from her.

439
00:39:56.485 --> 00:39:58.863
Well, you're hearing from her now.

440
00:39:58.865 --> 00:40:00.023
I'm gonna need some clothes

441
00:40:00.025 --> 00:40:00.874
that I can move in.

442
00:40:00.876 --> 00:40:02.123
Assemble a small team,

443
00:40:02.125 --> 00:40:03.543
and I'll take them in.

444
00:40:03.545 --> 00:40:05.093
Contact Roan.

445
00:40:05.095 --> 00:40:06.673
I'll pick him up on my way.

446
00:40:06.675 --> 00:40:08.123
I've already taken care of seven,

447
00:40:08.125 --> 00:40:10.748
so by the time that we,

448
00:40:13.915 --> 00:40:14.915
what is it?

449
00:40:15.715 --> 00:40:16.958
Jade, they have Roan.

450
00:40:19.142 --> 00:40:21.383
We're not going after
Hawthorn and Elle yet.

451
00:40:21.385 --> 00:40:23.093
Our priority is to protect

452
00:40:23.095 --> 00:40:25.343
our operation's integrity.

453
00:40:25.345 --> 00:40:27.928
I tracked his signature to here.

454
00:40:28.865 --> 00:40:31.363
This heavily wooded area is in the middle

455
00:40:31.365 --> 00:40:35.663
of a training compound owned
by an independent militia

456
00:40:35.665 --> 00:40:37.543
called Hand to God.

457
00:40:37.545 --> 00:40:40.343
They are extreme right wing survivalists

458
00:40:40.345 --> 00:40:41.963
that receive most of their funding

459
00:40:41.965 --> 00:40:43.533
through the Darrian Group.

460
00:40:43.535 --> 00:40:47.733
They are very seclusive and very paranoid.

461
00:40:47.735 --> 00:40:49.053
The leaders are prominent members

462
00:40:49.055 --> 00:40:50.803
of the communities around the compound,

463
00:40:50.805 --> 00:40:53.453
so local law enforcement

464
00:40:53.455 --> 00:40:55.205
will be protective of them as well.

465
00:40:56.705 --> 00:40:58.315
So you're sending me in alone

466
00:40:59.675 --> 00:41:01.468
to rescue one agent.

467
00:41:04.055 --> 00:41:05.055
If you can.

468
00:41:07.575 --> 00:41:11.293
We need you to go in quietly and find Roan

469
00:41:11.295 --> 00:41:12.683
and determine what, if anything,

470
00:41:12.685 --> 00:41:15.823
he may have told them about
any of our operations,

471
00:41:15.825 --> 00:41:19.173
particularly our work
on Darrian and Juliet.

472
00:41:19.175 --> 00:41:21.533
If you can bring him out quietly, then do.

473
00:41:21.535 --> 00:41:25.223
If not, then you have to eliminate

474
00:41:25.225 --> 00:41:28.238
any possibility of them
pulling anything else from him.

475
00:41:31.245 --> 00:41:32.245
Holy shit.

476
00:41:34.425 --> 00:41:35.993
I'll take you to a burner vehicle

477
00:41:35.995 --> 00:41:39.313
you can leave on the outside
perimeter of the compound.

478
00:41:39.315 --> 00:41:41.515
Everything you need has
already been loaded.

479
00:41:54.035 --> 00:41:55.035
It's for you.

480
00:41:55.925 --> 00:41:57.303
Had to reroute your calls

481
00:41:57.305 --> 00:41:59.208
till we find the phone you lost.

482
00:42:02.155 --> 00:42:03.155
Hawthorne.

483
00:42:05.285 --> 00:42:07.243
Yes, of course.

484
00:42:07.245 --> 00:42:08.448
Hello, Mr. Petrovich.

485
00:42:09.365 --> 00:42:10.765
Are you in the States again?

486
00:42:13.205 --> 00:42:14.638
Yes, yes, I do.

487
00:42:16.485 --> 00:42:18.538
Right, I'd be happy to accommodate.

488
00:42:19.455 --> 00:42:22.733
In fact, we have something very special

489
00:42:22.735 --> 00:42:24.085
I think you're gonna enjoy.

490
00:42:26.235 --> 00:42:29.992
Well, then, I'll make
the usual arrangements.

491
00:43:41.501 --> 00:43:45.590
Now what you need to remember is this.

492
00:43:45.592 --> 00:43:46.842
It's imperative

493
00:43:47.982 --> 00:43:49.762
for you to keep a situational awareness

494
00:43:51.155 --> 00:43:52.418
at all times.

495
00:43:54.165 --> 00:43:55.660
Failure to do so,

496
00:43:55.662 --> 00:43:57.714
can cost you your life

497
00:43:57.716 --> 00:43:59.616
and the lives of your fellow soldiers.

498
00:44:00.575 --> 00:44:03.684
You must always know what's
within your perimeter.

499
00:44:27.505 --> 00:44:28.337
Got you.

500
00:44:28.339 --> 00:44:29.438
So now you wanna
twist that weight just...

501
00:44:49.125 --> 00:44:50.678
How much did you tell them?

502
00:44:52.175 --> 00:44:53.175
Nothing.

503
00:44:54.499 --> 00:44:55.499
I think.

504
00:44:56.379 --> 00:44:58.328
I don't know, Jade.

505
00:44:58.330 --> 00:44:59.413
I don't know.

506
00:45:00.505 --> 00:45:01.605
Can you move?

507
00:45:03.015 --> 00:45:04.315
Not like you need me to.

508
00:45:21.455 --> 00:45:22.455
Cigarette?

509
00:45:24.415 --> 00:45:26.215
You know there's no time for that.

510
00:45:29.063 --> 00:45:30.063
Okay.

511
00:46:20.345 --> 00:46:21.695
Should give us two minutes,

512
00:46:22.815 --> 00:46:23.815
maybe less.

513
00:46:30.955 --> 00:46:31.955
Let's go.

514
00:46:44.272 --> 00:46:45.103
You ready?

515
00:46:45.105 --> 00:46:45.937
No.

516
00:49:21.975 --> 00:49:22.975
Carl?

517
00:49:24.235 --> 00:49:25.875
I'm sending you a location

518
00:49:27.075 --> 00:49:30.128
and a detailed description
of what I need you to get.

519
00:49:31.125 --> 00:49:32.158
Go fetch,

520
00:49:33.835 --> 00:49:35.318
and keep it zero impact.

521
00:49:36.385 --> 00:49:39.148
I need the absence to go
unnoticed at least a few days.

522
00:49:44.575 --> 00:49:45.575
Do you understand?

523
00:49:50.395 --> 00:49:51.788
Yes, of course.

524
00:52:29.921 --> 00:52:31.263
Hey.

525
00:52:34.552 --> 00:52:35.552
Hey.

526
00:53:25.063 --> 00:53:26.063
Sedated.

527
00:53:29.525 --> 00:53:32.237
You didn't follow protocol.

528
00:53:32.239 --> 00:53:33.239
No.

529
00:53:39.841 --> 00:53:40.841
Okay.

530
00:53:47.688 --> 00:53:49.923
This is time sensitive now.

531
00:53:49.925 --> 00:53:51.403
They all know that we know about them,

532
00:53:51.405 --> 00:53:53.405
even if he didn't give them any details.

533
00:53:54.495 --> 00:53:56.145
Tell me about Elle and Hawthorne.

534
00:53:57.375 --> 00:53:58.923
Hawthorne seemed to be in control

535
00:53:58.925 --> 00:54:00.993
of everything except her.

536
00:54:00.995 --> 00:54:03.438
She's definitely the
leader of whatever this is.

537
00:54:07.965 --> 00:54:09.173
If Hawthorne is involved

538
00:54:09.175 --> 00:54:11.863
with Darrian trafficking and sex slaves,

539
00:54:11.865 --> 00:54:13.650
and Elle has developed Juliet

540
00:54:13.652 --> 00:54:17.203
and is killing off all of his buyers,

541
00:54:17.205 --> 00:54:18.433
why the hell are they working together?

542
00:54:18.435 --> 00:54:19.763
I don't see the connection.

543
00:54:19.765 --> 00:54:21.958
What does Elle have over Hawthorne?

544
00:54:26.565 --> 00:54:27.565
What?

545
00:54:28.355 --> 00:54:29.858
The cure is the weapon.

546
00:54:31.325 --> 00:54:33.593
It's the money, Malcolm, the profit.

547
00:54:33.595 --> 00:54:34.893
If they control the only cure,

548
00:54:34.895 --> 00:54:35.894
and the virus is spreading

549
00:54:35.896 --> 00:54:38.133
throughout the entire sex trade,

550
00:54:38.135 --> 00:54:39.185
then what's it worth?

551
00:54:45.445 --> 00:54:46.813
They'd have to create a panic first

552
00:54:46.815 --> 00:54:47.973
to drive a market,

553
00:54:47.975 --> 00:54:50.128
somebody prominent, maybe several,

554
00:54:50.965 --> 00:54:52.715
to prove that anyone is vulnerable.

555
00:54:54.275 --> 00:54:55.463
What else, Jade?

556
00:54:55.465 --> 00:54:57.498
Anything she said or did that stood out.

557
00:54:59.665 --> 00:55:02.353
I can't remember too many specifics,

558
00:55:02.355 --> 00:55:04.043
especially at first.

559
00:55:04.045 --> 00:55:06.045
The drugs they gave me were pretty good,

560
00:55:07.645 --> 00:55:09.023
but she didn't seem to mind

561
00:55:09.025 --> 00:55:11.218
that I knew about Juliet or any of it,

562
00:55:12.085 --> 00:55:14.273
and she knew me.

563
00:55:14.275 --> 00:55:16.593
She knew about me, my background,

564
00:55:16.595 --> 00:55:17.843
before I was even awake,

565
00:55:17.845 --> 00:55:19.843
me, you, Ty, everything.

566
00:55:19.845 --> 00:55:21.483
Ty, she never met Ty.

567
00:55:21.485 --> 00:55:22.665
He wasn't here then.

568
00:55:24.175 --> 00:55:26.088
Well, she used his name,

569
00:55:28.125 --> 00:55:29.658
and something else was weird.

570
00:55:30.675 --> 00:55:33.033
She seemed like she really
didn't want to hurt me,

571
00:55:33.035 --> 00:55:35.630
like she was just keeping
Hawthorne in place...

572
00:55:35.632 --> 00:55:39.073
Don't ever underestimate her,

573
00:55:39.075 --> 00:55:40.278
not for a second.

574
00:55:44.025 --> 00:55:45.025
Let's go.

575
00:55:53.678 --> 00:55:55.345
Here you go, babe.

576
00:56:02.025 --> 00:56:04.798
That took quite a bit
longer than expected.

577
00:56:05.825 --> 00:56:07.823
Did you stop off for a nice dinner

578
00:56:07.825 --> 00:56:09.993
and some drinks?

579
00:56:09.995 --> 00:56:13.283
I ran into a hiccup,

580
00:56:13.285 --> 00:56:15.173
but it's all good.

581
00:56:15.175 --> 00:56:16.613
A hiccup?

582
00:56:16.615 --> 00:56:18.003
Yeah, what's
it to you, Hawthorne?

583
00:56:18.005 --> 00:56:19.008
I handled it.

584
00:56:19.865 --> 00:56:22.123
Oh, you handled it.

585
00:56:22.125 --> 00:56:24.363
Oh, lovely,

586
00:56:24.365 --> 00:56:27.013
and you handled what precisely?

587
00:56:27.015 --> 00:56:28.543
Just a security guard.

588
00:56:28.545 --> 00:56:29.713
It was no problem.

589
00:56:29.715 --> 00:56:31.015
Like I said, I handled it.

590
00:56:34.875 --> 00:56:38.053
Guys, look, I was the
one on the ground there.

591
00:56:38.055 --> 00:56:39.333
I took care of things.

592
00:56:39.335 --> 00:56:41.093
You don't like the way
I handle my business,

593
00:56:41.095 --> 00:56:45.405
next time, just send this
big, stupid pretty boy.

594
00:56:51.657 --> 00:56:53.153
That's good advice.

595
00:56:53.155 --> 00:56:54.405
Thank you for your input.

596
00:56:55.345 --> 00:56:56.177
Come on.

597
00:56:56.179 --> 00:56:57.193
Let's go.

598
00:56:57.195 --> 00:56:58.357
Just leave that.

599
00:56:58.359 --> 00:57:00.724
I'm not getting my deposit back anyway.

600
00:57:45.285 --> 00:57:46.508
Four clean cuts,

601
00:57:49.775 --> 00:57:52.478
Ka-Bar, maybe a Cold Steel Tanto.

602
00:57:53.945 --> 00:57:55.313
Elle?

603
00:57:55.315 --> 00:57:56.315
Absolutely.

604
00:57:59.335 --> 00:58:00.224
I wonder if he thought

605
00:58:00.226 --> 00:58:02.580
she didn't want to hurt him.

606
00:58:14.045 --> 00:58:15.248
You look disappointed.

607
00:58:17.655 --> 00:58:18.753
I really didn't believe

608
00:58:18.755 --> 00:58:21.788
they could move their
entire operation that fast.

609
00:58:23.495 --> 00:58:24.327
What makes you think

610
00:58:24.329 --> 00:58:25.718
that was their entire operation?

611
00:58:31.195 --> 00:58:32.468
Where are we going?

612
00:58:35.295 --> 00:58:37.053
Back to headquarters.

613
00:58:37.055 --> 00:58:39.973
Ty's been running some algorithms

614
00:58:39.975 --> 00:58:41.303
looking for commonalities

615
00:58:41.305 --> 00:58:43.678
between the names on Concotilli's list.

616
00:58:44.855 --> 00:58:46.368
Of the 11 names on the list,

617
00:58:47.345 --> 00:58:49.100
we were already watching seven of them

618
00:58:49.102 --> 00:58:50.698
for suspected trafficking.

619
00:58:52.055 --> 00:58:54.110
Does that surprise you?

620
00:58:54.112 --> 00:58:55.473
Not at all.

621
00:58:55.475 --> 00:58:57.308
Three of them have died this week.

622
00:58:58.955 --> 00:59:00.898
Yeah, I kind of don't care.

623
00:59:02.035 --> 00:59:03.788
Let her do our job for us,

624
00:59:05.185 --> 00:59:06.768
even if they are Americans.

625
00:59:08.425 --> 00:59:10.425
If we're lucky, they're all Americans.

626
00:59:12.145 --> 00:59:13.064
What do you think will happen

627
00:59:13.066 --> 00:59:15.858
if she kills a foreign
dignitary on American soil?

628
00:59:23.695 --> 00:59:26.383
It doesn't feel like
a couple of decades,

629
00:59:26.385 --> 00:59:27.385
does it, Malcolm?

630
00:59:28.285 --> 00:59:30.533
Sees like just a couple of years

631
00:59:30.535 --> 00:59:33.073
since we got the go ahead
for your new division.

632
00:59:33.075 --> 00:59:34.858
Chuck, why am I here?

633
00:59:36.112 --> 00:59:38.403
You know, I've never
really had to push you.

634
00:59:38.405 --> 00:59:39.993
You've always been very aggressive,

635
00:59:39.995 --> 00:59:43.323
and your teams have been
very effective for us.

636
00:59:43.325 --> 00:59:44.157
Well, I appreciate that,

637
00:59:44.159 --> 00:59:45.693
but why does it feel
like you just kissed me

638
00:59:45.695 --> 00:59:46.845
before bending me over?

639
00:59:48.175 --> 00:59:51.558
Well, your powers of observation
haven't deteriorated any.

640
00:59:54.445 --> 00:59:57.503
If it were the cartels or weapons dealers

641
00:59:57.505 --> 00:59:58.993
or even the bomb makers,

642
00:59:58.995 --> 01:00:00.973
these guys pop up in every country

643
01:00:00.975 --> 01:00:03.223
as fast as we can squish them,

644
01:00:03.225 --> 01:00:06.418
like a bunch of roaches
when you turn on the lights,

645
01:00:07.405 --> 01:00:10.653
but this bio thing, this Juliet...

646
01:00:10.655 --> 01:00:11.534
I don't see your point.

647
01:00:11.536 --> 01:00:12.743
Where's the comparison?

648
01:00:12.745 --> 01:00:14.373
Well, there is no comparison, Malcolm,

649
01:00:14.375 --> 01:00:16.003
and that is the point.

650
01:00:16.005 --> 01:00:18.003
This is coming from a single source.

651
01:00:18.005 --> 01:00:19.683
It's not some fashion trend

652
01:00:19.685 --> 01:00:21.643
the whole world is jumping on,

653
01:00:21.645 --> 01:00:22.873
and from what I hear,

654
01:00:22.875 --> 01:00:25.133
it's originating in the United States.

655
01:00:25.135 --> 01:00:26.403
From what you hear?

656
01:00:26.405 --> 01:00:28.103
Look, Malcolm, we have two more dead

657
01:00:28.105 --> 01:00:30.088
in the past four days,

658
01:00:31.275 --> 01:00:33.203
both very wealthy,

659
01:00:33.205 --> 01:00:35.773
and one very well connected.

660
01:00:35.775 --> 01:00:38.673
How can I justify funding your division

661
01:00:38.675 --> 01:00:39.823
if you can't find this

662
01:00:39.825 --> 01:00:42.463
and eliminate it in your own backyard?

663
01:00:42.465 --> 01:00:44.223
You've got Black working on this,

664
01:00:44.225 --> 01:00:45.493
and she's getting nowhere.

665
01:00:45.495 --> 01:00:46.668
Not nowhere, Chuck.

666
01:00:54.045 --> 01:00:55.250
Hofner, do you need something?

667
01:00:55.252 --> 01:00:57.793
Oh, do you
need any coffee, sir?

668
01:00:57.795 --> 01:00:58.795
No.

669
01:01:00.015 --> 01:01:01.848
All right, what's nowhere?

670
01:01:03.625 --> 01:01:05.263
We don't know exactly what it is,

671
01:01:05.265 --> 01:01:06.673
but we know there's an antidote,

672
01:01:06.675 --> 01:01:08.803
and we know who the source is.

673
01:01:08.805 --> 01:01:09.883
Well, why don't we have him?

674
01:01:09.885 --> 01:01:11.523
It's a her, and her name is Elle,

675
01:01:11.525 --> 01:01:13.063
and she was one of ours,

676
01:01:13.065 --> 01:01:15.003
one of the first we
rescued from trafficking

677
01:01:15.005 --> 01:01:16.843
and put into the program.

678
01:01:16.845 --> 01:01:18.643
She knows our MO

679
01:01:18.645 --> 01:01:20.088
as well as anyone ever will.

680
01:01:21.425 --> 01:01:22.274
That's why she's been able

681
01:01:22.276 --> 01:01:24.638
to stay a step ahead of us until now.

682
01:01:25.775 --> 01:01:27.033
Until now?

683
01:01:27.035 --> 01:01:29.153
Ty has been looking
into the tax records,

684
01:01:29.155 --> 01:01:30.873
at the ownership of the last property

685
01:01:30.875 --> 01:01:32.243
we knew her to inhabit,

686
01:01:32.245 --> 01:01:33.883
and he found another warehouse

687
01:01:33.885 --> 01:01:35.283
about a mile and a half away

688
01:01:35.285 --> 01:01:36.923
owned by the same holding company

689
01:01:36.925 --> 01:01:38.713
with the same purchase date.

690
01:01:38.715 --> 01:01:40.898
Jade has a team en route now.

691
01:01:41.905 --> 01:01:44.683
What the hell are you standing here for?

692
01:01:44.685 --> 01:01:45.685
You called me in.

693
01:01:51.925 --> 01:01:53.025
Next time I see her,

694
01:01:54.245 --> 01:01:55.843
I'm gonna take care of things my way.

695
01:01:55.845 --> 01:01:56.845
No.

696
01:01:59.395 --> 01:02:01.013
No.

697
01:02:01.015 --> 01:02:03.323
There were no allowances
for this in the plan.

698
01:02:03.325 --> 01:02:04.325
Adapt.

699
01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:07.683
We just need to regain control

700
01:02:07.685 --> 01:02:09.883
and get back on track
with the original plan.

701
01:02:09.885 --> 01:02:10.885
No.

702
01:02:11.865 --> 01:02:13.053
No.

703
01:02:13.055 --> 01:02:16.578
Do not presume to know what I need.

704
01:02:18.165 --> 01:02:19.765
We have to get our focus back.

705
01:02:21.365 --> 01:02:23.513
Focus, sure,

706
01:02:23.515 --> 01:02:25.243
and maintain the illusion of control

707
01:02:25.245 --> 01:02:28.963
over the actions of Malcolm dearest

708
01:02:28.965 --> 01:02:30.508
and his lovely little viper.

709
01:02:32.025 --> 01:02:34.143
You better remember this is about money,

710
01:02:34.145 --> 01:02:35.693
not a vendetta.

711
01:02:35.695 --> 01:02:37.838
Well, that's cute when the puppy barks.

712
01:02:38.675 --> 01:02:40.288
You can't let it get personal.

713
01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:45.877
It is personal.

714
01:02:47.446 --> 01:02:48.696
It is personal.

715
01:02:56.645 --> 01:02:57.645
Yes?

716
01:02:59.125 --> 01:03:00.783
Oh, how clever.

717
01:03:00.785 --> 01:03:01.785
When?

718
01:03:05.425 --> 01:03:09.293
Well, then, go now please.

719
01:03:09.295 --> 01:03:10.194
You know exactly what to do.

720
01:03:10.196 --> 01:03:11.438
Just start small.

721
01:03:14.135 --> 01:03:15.858
Let's not dally, shall we?

722
01:04:09.785 --> 01:04:10.785
We have her.

723
01:04:12.145 --> 01:04:13.623
She's alive.

724
01:04:13.625 --> 01:04:14.563
Hawthorne?

725
01:04:14.565 --> 01:04:15.565
Vanished.

726
01:04:46.151 --> 01:04:48.068
Well, hello, Malcolm.

727
01:04:49.465 --> 01:04:54.338
It is so nice to see you again.

728
01:04:55.885 --> 01:04:58.533
Still fighting the good fight, are we?

729
01:04:58.535 --> 01:04:59.535
I am.

730
01:05:00.595 --> 01:05:02.516
And still losing.

731
01:05:02.518 --> 01:05:04.858
And yet here you sit in my holding cell.

732
01:05:07.435 --> 01:05:08.435
For now.

733
01:05:17.146 --> 01:05:20.503
The last time, I
tried to help you, Elle.

734
01:05:20.505 --> 01:05:22.293
I won't be making that mistake again.

735
01:05:22.295 --> 01:05:23.523
Help me?

736
01:05:23.525 --> 01:05:24.703
Yes.

737
01:05:24.705 --> 01:05:28.323
This time I will value
security over rehabilitation.

738
01:05:28.325 --> 01:05:29.254
Help me.

739
01:05:29.256 --> 01:05:30.363
Help me?

740
01:05:30.365 --> 01:05:32.563
You abandoned me.

741
01:05:32.565 --> 01:05:34.873
You plucked me from one nightmare,

742
01:05:34.875 --> 01:05:36.513
and when you were through with me,

743
01:05:36.515 --> 01:05:38.365
you dropped me straight into another.

744
01:05:48.271 --> 01:05:51.523
And when you were
through with me, Malcolm,

745
01:05:51.525 --> 01:05:54.963
after you threw me in the trash,

746
01:05:54.965 --> 01:05:57.768
found yourself a new toy to play with.

747
01:05:58.951 --> 01:06:00.048
Look at her.

748
01:06:01.235 --> 01:06:02.873
Does she know what awaits her?

749
01:06:02.875 --> 01:06:03.875
Do you?

750
01:06:04.705 --> 01:06:09.705
When you grow tired of being
their mindless killing machine

751
01:06:09.845 --> 01:06:12.203
and you start asking questions,

752
01:06:12.205 --> 01:06:15.928
if you decide to speak your mind, mind.

753
01:06:16.775 --> 01:06:18.075
Can I just kill her now?

754
01:06:34.435 --> 01:06:35.377
If you expect me to believe

755
01:06:35.379 --> 01:06:37.643
that you think you're
doing something noble

756
01:06:37.645 --> 01:06:38.763
for the greater good,

757
01:06:38.765 --> 01:06:40.638
then you are in for a disappointment.

758
01:06:41.925 --> 01:06:43.825
I already know it's all for the money.

759
01:06:44.955 --> 01:06:47.683
And when the costs are too great,

760
01:06:47.685 --> 01:06:50.098
and there is no market for the product,

761
01:06:51.985 --> 01:06:53.798
it disappears.

762
01:06:54.915 --> 01:06:57.038
How do you not see that?

763
01:06:57.895 --> 01:06:59.983
And if you make a few
billion in the process,

764
01:06:59.985 --> 01:07:00.998
that's okay, right?

765
01:07:02.395 --> 01:07:05.336
You and your sick little
friend, Hawthorne.

766
01:07:05.338 --> 01:07:06.595
He serves his purpose.

767
01:07:13.221 --> 01:07:15.073
I have to go see Ty.

768
01:07:15.075 --> 01:07:16.677
Go.

769
01:07:27.075 --> 01:07:30.998
Elle, tell me where Hawthorne is,

770
01:07:32.483 --> 01:07:34.179
where he's heading.

771
01:07:34.181 --> 01:07:35.831
You can still do the right thing.

772
01:07:38.349 --> 01:07:41.008
You never really did see me, did you?

773
01:07:52.999 --> 01:07:54.434
You break my heart, Elle.

774
01:07:58.875 --> 01:08:01.083
I break your heart?

775
01:08:01.085 --> 01:08:02.158
Fuck you, Malcolm.

776
01:08:03.490 --> 01:08:04.490
Malcolm.

777
01:08:46.105 --> 01:08:47.303
Jade, come in.

778
01:08:47.305 --> 01:08:48.184
Sit.

779
01:08:48.186 --> 01:08:50.928
Tell me you have something
of value for me, Ty.

780
01:08:51.955 --> 01:08:53.513
Oh, I have something for sure.

781
01:08:53.515 --> 01:08:56.013
I'm just not sure the value yet.

782
01:08:56.015 --> 01:08:57.713
We were going through Concotilli's notes

783
01:08:57.715 --> 01:08:59.253
about Juliet and the antidote,

784
01:08:59.255 --> 01:09:01.473
which we're now calling Romeo, of course.

785
01:09:01.475 --> 01:09:03.413
Right, of course.

786
01:09:03.415 --> 01:09:05.503
We haven't been making any progress

787
01:09:05.505 --> 01:09:08.833
because we haven't had a
live sample to test from.

788
01:09:08.835 --> 01:09:09.835
Live sample?

789
01:09:11.935 --> 01:09:13.473
It's not a poison.

790
01:09:13.475 --> 01:09:16.563
It's a living virus that's
been genetically modified.

791
01:09:16.565 --> 01:09:19.223
It lies dormant in the host's system,

792
01:09:19.225 --> 01:09:20.057
and once activated,

793
01:09:20.059 --> 01:09:21.798
it's fatal within a few hours.

794
01:09:22.995 --> 01:09:27.193
The problem has been that
the virus dies with the host.

795
01:09:27.195 --> 01:09:30.533
And that's why you can't
find a living sample.

796
01:09:30.535 --> 01:09:33.043
Until yesterday.

797
01:09:33.045 --> 01:09:34.573
Well, we knew it needed
to be in liquid form

798
01:09:34.575 --> 01:09:36.513
from the notes so it could be injected

799
01:09:36.515 --> 01:09:37.793
or ingested through drink

800
01:09:37.795 --> 01:09:41.163
or transferred through bodily fluid,

801
01:09:41.165 --> 01:09:43.273
so the little girl that
was with the congressman

802
01:09:43.275 --> 01:09:44.873
should have been dead too.

803
01:09:44.875 --> 01:09:46.108
So why wasn't she?

804
01:09:47.185 --> 01:09:49.258
Because there was no pleasure.

805
01:09:52.925 --> 01:09:54.753
The virus lies dormant

806
01:09:54.755 --> 01:09:57.433
in the host's system until activated.

807
01:09:57.435 --> 01:09:59.333
Now we've learned that the triggers

808
01:09:59.335 --> 01:10:01.313
are oxytocin and dopamine,

809
01:10:01.315 --> 01:10:02.773
the very chemicals responsible

810
01:10:02.775 --> 01:10:05.653
for excitement and pleasure, respectively.

811
01:10:05.655 --> 01:10:07.403
Which the body manufactures

812
01:10:07.405 --> 01:10:09.583
in huge quantities during sex.

813
01:10:09.585 --> 01:10:11.033
Unless you're a young girl

814
01:10:11.035 --> 01:10:12.253
being forced by a congressman,

815
01:10:12.255 --> 01:10:14.803
in which case, there is only a milligram

816
01:10:14.805 --> 01:10:17.203
of dopamine being manufactured.

817
01:10:17.205 --> 01:10:18.583
Good God,

818
01:10:18.585 --> 01:10:20.673
so the virus is alive and dormant

819
01:10:20.675 --> 01:10:22.233
in the little girl.

820
01:10:22.235 --> 01:10:23.893
Yes,

821
01:10:23.895 --> 01:10:25.913
but now we have a live sample

822
01:10:25.915 --> 01:10:29.243
to use to synthesize a remedy from

823
01:10:29.245 --> 01:10:30.313
as soon as we figure out the rest

824
01:10:30.315 --> 01:10:32.433
of the equation from Concotilli's notes.

825
01:10:32.435 --> 01:10:34.433
We confiscated Richardson's
computer last night,

826
01:10:34.435 --> 01:10:35.435
so that should help.

827
01:10:36.405 --> 01:10:40.803
Ty, you said it has to
remain in liquid form.

828
01:10:40.805 --> 01:10:42.583
Can it be frozen?

829
01:10:42.585 --> 01:10:43.417
Not likely.

830
01:10:43.419 --> 01:10:44.883
It probably wouldn't survive.

831
01:10:44.885 --> 01:10:46.518
What about aerosolized?

832
01:10:48.795 --> 01:10:49.795
Sure.

833
01:10:51.995 --> 01:10:53.653
Ty, I need you to stop working on that

834
01:10:53.655 --> 01:10:54.848
for a few minutes.

835
01:10:56.185 --> 01:10:58.393
Last week, there was a
missing person's report

836
01:10:58.395 --> 01:11:00.473
on the FBI bulletins.

837
01:11:00.475 --> 01:11:01.863
It was a security guard

838
01:11:01.865 --> 01:11:04.623
at a commercial architectural
firm here in town.

839
01:11:04.625 --> 01:11:07.813
There were some blueprints
missing from the firm.

840
01:11:07.815 --> 01:11:09.553
I need you to find out exactly

841
01:11:09.555 --> 01:11:11.493
what were on those plans

842
01:11:11.495 --> 01:11:12.913
and for what building.

843
01:11:12.915 --> 01:11:14.973
Get me as much as you can on it.

844
01:11:14.975 --> 01:11:16.403
I can do that.

845
01:11:16.405 --> 01:11:18.473
And a list of any other properties

846
01:11:18.475 --> 01:11:22.193
that the Universal Exports
Holding Company is tied to

847
01:11:22.195 --> 01:11:23.853
anywhere in the States.

848
01:11:23.855 --> 01:11:26.808
Ty, keep this between us for now.

849
01:11:28.685 --> 01:11:30.058
Sure, whatever you need,

850
01:11:31.845 --> 01:11:33.223
but if the shit hits the fans,

851
01:11:33.225 --> 01:11:35.402
I will be throwing you
right under the bus.

852
01:12:59.105 --> 01:13:00.553
Where did you come from?

853
01:13:00.555 --> 01:13:01.788
Is the ambassador in?

854
01:13:04.145 --> 01:13:06.563
I need to speak with Mr. Petrovich.

855
01:13:06.565 --> 01:13:07.491
He's busy.

856
01:13:11.794 --> 01:13:12.794
I know.

857
01:15:36.295 --> 01:15:37.295
Go ahead.

858
01:15:38.255 --> 01:15:39.905
How much of it, Malcolm?

859
01:15:41.685 --> 01:15:42.685
All of it.

860
01:15:44.105 --> 01:15:45.705
In her reality, all of it, Jade.

861
01:15:47.585 --> 01:15:48.835
How did you choose her?

862
01:15:51.105 --> 01:15:53.288
Almost exactly the
same way we chose you.

863
01:15:55.375 --> 01:15:58.238
She was younger, though, 11 or so.

864
01:16:03.205 --> 01:16:04.403
In a building full of girls,

865
01:16:04.405 --> 01:16:06.083
she was the one that resisted the most,

866
01:16:06.085 --> 01:16:07.085
just like you, Jade.

867
01:16:08.145 --> 01:16:09.928
So you think that showed promise.

868
01:16:10.775 --> 01:16:11.775
Is that it?

869
01:16:13.305 --> 01:16:16.823
I think the fact that
they beat you with a cane

870
01:16:16.825 --> 01:16:18.103
and you still resisted

871
01:16:18.105 --> 01:16:19.668
showed your internal strength.

872
01:16:23.925 --> 01:16:26.073
That's why I chose you, Jade.

873
01:16:26.075 --> 01:16:27.375
What about her, Malcolm?

874
01:16:28.295 --> 01:16:30.288
Did they beat her with a cane too?

875
01:16:31.195 --> 01:16:34.316
Did she resist enough
to prove herself to you?

876
01:16:34.318 --> 01:16:35.318
No.

877
01:16:41.485 --> 01:16:42.685
They stripped her naked,

878
01:16:44.055 --> 01:16:46.218
covered her with makeup for a buyer.

879
01:16:50.695 --> 01:16:52.493
She took the makeup pencil away

880
01:16:52.495 --> 01:16:54.703
and stabbed one of them
in the neck repeatedly

881
01:16:54.705 --> 01:16:55.913
until he was dead.

882
01:16:55.915 --> 01:16:57.838
They couldn't give her away after that.

883
01:16:58.915 --> 01:17:00.163
They were just about to execute her

884
01:17:00.165 --> 01:17:01.165
when we raided them.

885
01:17:05.075 --> 01:17:06.093
Thanks, Jen.

886
01:17:06.095 --> 01:17:08.561
Go ahead and send him in.

887
01:17:08.563 --> 01:17:09.646
Okay.

888
01:17:11.095 --> 01:17:12.823
Jade, I have the paperwork

889
01:17:12.825 --> 01:17:14.010
you've been waiting for.

890
01:17:14.012 --> 01:17:16.193
If you just wanna stop by my office...

891
01:17:16.195 --> 01:17:17.026
It's fine, Ty.

892
01:17:17.028 --> 01:17:17.860
Bring it here.

893
01:17:17.862 --> 01:17:19.203
What do you have?

894
01:17:19.205 --> 01:17:20.523
You were right.

895
01:17:20.525 --> 01:17:22.333
There are some blueprints missing

896
01:17:22.335 --> 01:17:24.003
for the Tolson Center in Naples.

897
01:17:24.005 --> 01:17:26.883
I checked, but there's not a
lot of activity there lately,

898
01:17:26.885 --> 01:17:29.423
but they are holding a
Democratic fundraiser

899
01:17:29.425 --> 01:17:30.271
day after tomorrow.

900
01:17:30.273 --> 01:17:31.722
And the other thing?

901
01:17:32.805 --> 01:17:34.933
Yeah, right there.

902
01:17:34.935 --> 01:17:37.953
It's sorted by proximity of each one

903
01:17:37.955 --> 01:17:40.633
to the two properties Elle was using.

904
01:17:40.635 --> 01:17:41.517
What's this?

905
01:17:41.519 --> 01:17:43.263
This one looks close.

906
01:17:43.265 --> 01:17:44.965
Yeah, that's a storage facility.

907
01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:47.773
I'll get a team together.

908
01:17:47.775 --> 01:17:49.363
No, not yet.

909
01:17:49.365 --> 01:17:50.365
We have another day.

910
01:17:52.210 --> 01:17:53.610
I think our ship has a leak.

911
01:18:07.025 --> 01:18:07.856
I'll be in my...

912
01:18:07.858 --> 01:18:08.690
Yeah.

913
01:18:08.692 --> 01:18:10.293
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

914
01:18:10.295 --> 01:18:11.295
Yeah.

915
01:18:47.558 --> 01:18:49.173
Hofner?

916
01:18:49.175 --> 01:18:50.174
Director Watts wanted me

917
01:18:50.176 --> 01:18:51.843
to give you her transfer papers

918
01:18:51.845 --> 01:18:54.712
and for you not to forget
that requisition form for...

919
01:18:58.903 --> 01:19:00.236
What the hell?

920
01:19:38.188 --> 01:19:39.938
That should buy us an hour or so.

921
01:20:07.792 --> 01:20:08.792
Oh God.

922
01:21:37.365 --> 01:21:39.573
What could you possibly
say to me, Malcolm,

923
01:21:39.575 --> 01:21:42.113
to keep me from shutting
down your division?

924
01:21:42.115 --> 01:21:42.974
Hofner was your man.

925
01:21:42.976 --> 01:21:45.033
You hired him.

926
01:21:45.035 --> 01:21:46.113
Don't fuck with me.

927
01:21:46.115 --> 01:21:47.473
I'm not playing with you.

928
01:21:47.475 --> 01:21:48.983
This is some serious shit.

929
01:21:48.985 --> 01:21:50.213
You think I'm playing?

930
01:21:50.215 --> 01:21:51.623
Really, Chuck?

931
01:21:51.625 --> 01:21:54.343
Jennifer was my assistant for five years.

932
01:21:54.345 --> 01:21:55.673
She wasn't great at what she did,

933
01:21:55.675 --> 01:21:56.723
but she was loyal,

934
01:21:56.725 --> 01:21:57.903
and she was a friend,

935
01:21:57.905 --> 01:21:59.763
and she was just slaughtered

936
01:21:59.765 --> 01:22:02.053
so that Elle could make a point.

937
01:22:02.055 --> 01:22:03.123
Exactly.

938
01:22:03.125 --> 01:22:04.893
You created this monster,

939
01:22:04.895 --> 01:22:06.393
and then you let her get away,

940
01:22:06.395 --> 01:22:07.953
and when you finally brought her back in,

941
01:22:07.955 --> 01:22:09.473
she's literally killing us

942
01:22:09.475 --> 01:22:11.065
inside our own offices...

943
01:22:11.067 --> 01:22:12.340
Bullshit.

944
01:22:12.342 --> 01:22:15.363
You know you can't lay that crap on me.

945
01:22:15.365 --> 01:22:16.683
She had us from the inside out.

946
01:22:16.685 --> 01:22:18.583
There was no way that any
of us could have known

947
01:22:18.585 --> 01:22:20.328
she had him in her pocket.

948
01:22:22.972 --> 01:22:24.272
So it was Hofner.

949
01:22:25.175 --> 01:22:26.632
Yeah, it was Hofner.

950
01:22:27.647 --> 01:22:28.584
Wait.

951
01:22:28.586 --> 01:22:31.153
You knew we were compromised before.

952
01:22:31.155 --> 01:22:31.987
Why didn't...

953
01:22:31.989 --> 01:22:34.428
Because she didn't know.

954
01:22:35.335 --> 01:22:36.703
Yesterday I had a suspicion

955
01:22:36.705 --> 01:22:37.823
there was an information leak,

956
01:22:37.825 --> 01:22:40.775
but I had no idea she actually
had someone from the inside.

957
01:22:43.255 --> 01:22:44.933
Wait, what's that?

958
01:22:44.935 --> 01:22:46.723
Blueprints from the Tolson Center,

959
01:22:46.725 --> 01:22:48.173
everything except the floor plan

960
01:22:48.175 --> 01:22:49.883
and the ventilation system.

961
01:22:49.885 --> 01:22:51.163
Those were missing.

962
01:22:51.165 --> 01:22:52.643
Where did you get them?

963
01:22:52.645 --> 01:22:53.963
A storage unit with Elle's name

964
01:22:53.965 --> 01:22:54.965
written all over it.

965
01:22:56.215 --> 01:22:58.544
The Tolson Center in Naples?

966
01:22:58.546 --> 01:23:00.443
Oh, hell, I have to be there

967
01:23:00.445 --> 01:23:03.009
for a fundraiser tomorrow night.

968
01:23:03.011 --> 01:23:05.223
Well, then, I suggest you just mail

969
01:23:05.225 --> 01:23:06.423
in a check instead.

970
01:23:06.425 --> 01:23:08.353
I'll have Ty arrange for our flights.

971
01:23:08.355 --> 01:23:09.943
Are you sure she'll be there?

972
01:23:09.945 --> 01:23:11.563
It's her target demographic.

973
01:23:11.565 --> 01:23:14.083
She wouldn't trust it
to Hawthorne by himself.

974
01:23:14.085 --> 01:23:15.703
How can you know for sure?

975
01:23:15.705 --> 01:23:16.598
Because I wouldn't.

976
01:23:22.963 --> 01:23:24.380
Director Watts.

977
01:23:25.675 --> 01:23:26.675
What?

978
01:23:27.545 --> 01:23:28.928
Oh my God.

979
01:23:30.895 --> 01:23:31.895
Yes, sir.

980
01:23:32.855 --> 01:23:34.078
No, of course, sir.

981
01:23:35.265 --> 01:23:36.898
I'll be there, Mr. Secretary.

982
01:23:39.805 --> 01:23:40.664
I have to be in a room

983
01:23:40.666 --> 01:23:42.465
with a call to the Kremlin tomorrow.

984
01:23:43.445 --> 01:23:46.693
The Russian ambassador
has just been killed

985
01:23:46.695 --> 01:23:48.218
with the Juliet virus.

986
01:23:49.895 --> 01:23:50.727
We have to stop them

987
01:23:50.729 --> 01:23:52.203
before anyone arrives tomorrow.

988
01:23:52.205 --> 01:23:54.233
She was already gone when
you found the blueprints.

989
01:23:54.235 --> 01:23:55.535
She doesn't know you know.

990
01:23:56.645 --> 01:23:57.695
Of course she does,

991
01:23:58.968 --> 01:24:00.568
but she knows it doesn't matter.

992
01:24:52.045 --> 01:24:53.045
I don't like it.

993
01:24:54.659 --> 01:24:56.576
Yeah, I don't either.

994
01:24:57.545 --> 01:24:58.464
Assume they're already here

995
01:24:58.466 --> 01:24:59.718
and aware of us.

996
01:25:01.435 --> 01:25:02.267
I'll go up to the second floor

997
01:25:02.269 --> 01:25:03.644
and let the security office

998
01:25:03.646 --> 01:25:04.484
know that we're here,

999
01:25:04.486 --> 01:25:07.133
get them to evacuate the building quietly.

1000
01:25:07.135 --> 01:25:08.353
I'll go floor to floor,

1001
01:25:08.355 --> 01:25:09.658
check the intake as we go.

1002
01:25:10.525 --> 01:25:11.525
No need.

1003
01:25:16.515 --> 01:25:17.633
There's access to each layer

1004
01:25:17.635 --> 01:25:19.283
of the ventilation
system from maintenance.

1005
01:25:19.285 --> 01:25:20.952
Go to the basement.

1006
01:25:20.954 --> 01:25:23.454
That's where Elle would start.

1007
01:26:03.211 --> 01:26:04.211
Jade.

1008
01:26:05.602 --> 01:26:07.435
Did you miss me, baby?

1009
01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:11.418
Oh, I'm not gonna miss.

1010
01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:13.503
I knew you'd come back.

1011
01:29:46.365 --> 01:29:47.680
Hello, Malcolm.

1012
01:29:48.516 --> 01:29:50.243
Welcome to the jungle.

1013
01:29:50.245 --> 01:29:51.245
We've missed you.

1014
01:30:01.811 --> 01:30:03.387
Right where I want you,

1015
01:30:03.389 --> 01:30:05.376
flat on your back.

1016
01:30:42.139 --> 01:30:43.837
Right where I want you,

1017
01:30:43.839 --> 01:30:45.339
flat on your back.

1018
01:31:29.420 --> 01:31:31.670
Elle, what are you doing?

1019
01:31:33.264 --> 01:31:34.333
You can still stop this.

1020
01:31:34.335 --> 01:31:36.143
It's not too late.

1021
01:31:36.145 --> 01:31:38.323
You mean this, Malcolm?

1022
01:31:38.325 --> 01:31:40.813
Oh, it's too late.

1023
01:31:40.815 --> 01:31:42.813
It was too late before you ever pulled me

1024
01:31:42.815 --> 01:31:46.353
out of that bunker in
Czechoslovakia all those years ago.

1025
01:31:46.355 --> 01:31:47.855
Can't you see that?

1026
01:31:49.185 --> 01:31:50.986
Let me take you in.

1027
01:31:50.988 --> 01:31:52.393
I can still help you.

1028
01:31:52.395 --> 01:31:54.563
Oh, Malcolm, you did help me.

1029
01:31:54.565 --> 01:31:55.573
When you locked me away

1030
01:31:55.575 --> 01:31:57.683
with all those loonies,

1031
01:31:57.685 --> 01:32:00.085
you helped me realize that this

1032
01:32:01.592 --> 01:32:04.083
has always been my destiny.

1033
01:32:04.085 --> 01:32:07.103
See, I had to suffer the indignities,

1034
01:32:07.105 --> 01:32:11.728
the ripping and tearing of
my body and my innocence.

1035
01:32:13.475 --> 01:32:15.713
How else could I be rewarded

1036
01:32:15.715 --> 01:32:20.715
and still be the bearer
of such a precise justice?

1037
01:32:22.606 --> 01:32:23.940
Good God, Elle.

1038
01:32:23.942 --> 01:32:26.315
Oh, shut up, cry baby.

1039
01:32:53.095 --> 01:32:54.558
Stand down, Jade.

1040
01:32:57.451 --> 01:32:58.483
Damn it, Black.

1041
01:32:58.485 --> 01:32:59.943
I said stand down,

1042
01:32:59.945 --> 01:33:00.945
and I mean now.

1043
01:33:09.275 --> 01:33:10.275
Sorry.

1044
01:33:11.025 --> 01:33:12.575
We have to take her in alive.

1045
01:33:14.725 --> 01:33:16.825
We need to get all the information we can.

1046
01:33:58.145 --> 01:34:00.848
Information.

1047
01:34:05.235 --> 01:34:06.235
Information.

1048
01:34:07.075 --> 01:34:09.623
You already have all the information.

1049
01:34:09.625 --> 01:34:10.625
Bullshit.

1050
01:34:11.825 --> 01:34:12.825
Oh, come on.

1051
01:34:14.095 --> 01:34:17.838
You know the truth in your
heart, don't you, girl?

1052
01:34:19.275 --> 01:34:20.275
Don't you?

1053
01:34:23.905 --> 01:34:25.578
You've been following the money,

1054
01:34:26.735 --> 01:34:31.498
but what is more dear to
a powerful man than greed?

1055
01:34:32.535 --> 01:34:34.023
Self-preservation.

1056
01:34:34.025 --> 01:34:35.218
You can see that.

1057
01:34:36.295 --> 01:34:37.963
You can see that.

1058
01:34:37.965 --> 01:34:38.924
What are you saying?

1059
01:34:38.926 --> 01:34:42.273
It's not abut who
stands to gain the most

1060
01:34:42.275 --> 01:34:45.123
from a global scale influx
of Juliet, of course.

1061
01:34:45.125 --> 01:34:49.133
No, it's about who
stands to lose the most.

1062
01:34:49.135 --> 01:34:50.873
Who's afraid of it,

1063
01:34:50.875 --> 01:34:52.453
and who holds the power?

1064
01:34:52.455 --> 01:34:54.573
Who holds the power, Jade?

1065
01:34:54.575 --> 01:34:55.763
Surely you know.

1066
01:34:55.765 --> 01:34:56.954
Come on, Jade.

1067
01:35:07.005 --> 01:35:08.891
Thank you, God.

1068
01:35:43.655 --> 01:35:44.655
It's done.

1069
01:35:45.555 --> 01:35:47.385
Wire the balance to my account.

1070
01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:50.060
No, that will be fine.

1071
01:35:51.453 --> 01:35:52.453
Thank you.

1072
01:36:03.815 --> 01:36:04.815
Megan?

1073
01:36:06.345 --> 01:36:09.193
Wow, what are you doing here?

1074
01:36:09.195 --> 01:36:10.463
I'm sorry.

1075
01:36:10.465 --> 01:36:11.768
The position was open.

1076
01:36:12.785 --> 01:36:15.178
Yeah, it's great to see you.

1077
01:36:18.785 --> 01:36:20.135
I hope you're doing okay.

1078
01:36:21.255 --> 01:36:22.438
Yeah, you too.

1079
01:36:27.165 --> 01:36:29.068
Wow, Megan.

1080
01:36:30.375 --> 01:36:32.014
I needed someone.

1081
01:36:32.016 --> 01:36:32.847
If you don't approve, you can...

1082
01:36:32.849 --> 01:36:33.849
No, it's fine.

1083
01:36:35.525 --> 01:36:37.238
Congratulations on the promotion.

1084
01:36:38.307 --> 01:36:40.013
Yeah, I don't think anybody else

1085
01:36:40.015 --> 01:36:42.498
wanted the job after Watts stepped down.

1086
01:36:43.485 --> 01:36:45.585
He really tainted the office, so to speak,

1087
01:36:46.495 --> 01:36:47.628
all the accusations.

1088
01:36:48.605 --> 01:36:49.953
Has he been convicted?

1089
01:36:49.955 --> 01:36:51.579
Of course not.

1090
01:36:51.581 --> 01:36:53.431
I mean, it never reaches that far up,

1091
01:36:54.695 --> 01:36:56.455
but then he'll never be back here either,

1092
01:36:56.457 --> 01:36:57.790
so we have that.

1093
01:37:02.945 --> 01:37:03.945
Jade.

1094
01:37:05.785 --> 01:37:07.493
I was thinking of recommending you

1095
01:37:07.495 --> 01:37:08.568
for my old position.

1096
01:37:09.705 --> 01:37:11.743
The Secretary will
probably accept my choice,

1097
01:37:11.745 --> 01:37:14.792
and there's not another agent
more qualified than you.

1098
01:37:15.789 --> 01:37:17.573
Of course, you'll have to
get used to the red tape,

1099
01:37:17.575 --> 01:37:19.866
but I know you can handle it.

1100
01:37:19.868 --> 01:37:21.023
Do you need some more time to think?

1101
01:37:21.025 --> 01:37:22.203
We can talk in a couple of days

1102
01:37:22.205 --> 01:37:24.193
when you have more questions.

1103
01:37:24.195 --> 01:37:25.345
Malcolm, I'm leaving.

1104
01:37:32.445 --> 01:37:34.089
Are you sure?

1105
01:37:34.091 --> 01:37:36.393
You have a home here.

1106
01:37:36.395 --> 01:37:37.833
You know I haven't really had a home

1107
01:37:37.835 --> 01:37:39.893
since I was 13,

1108
01:37:39.895 --> 01:37:42.073
but you've been good to me, Malcolm.

1109
01:37:42.075 --> 01:37:43.225
I'll never forget that,

1110
01:37:44.145 --> 01:37:45.998
and I hope you can forgive me.

1111
01:37:46.984 --> 01:37:49.401
There's nothing to forgive.

1112
01:37:50.785 --> 01:37:51.785
Just promise me

1113
01:37:52.689 --> 01:37:53.604
if you ever change your mind

1114
01:37:53.606 --> 01:37:55.255
you won't hesitate to come to me.

1115
01:37:57.351 --> 01:37:59.448
You have a place wherever I have a place.

1116
01:38:00.645 --> 01:38:02.171
Of course.

1117
01:38:02.173 --> 01:38:03.573
You know I'll keep in touch.

1118
01:38:17.185 --> 01:38:19.402
It's not polite to stare, Megan.

1119
01:38:23.145 --> 01:38:28.145
