the absolute maximum
chamber pressure exactly

164
00:11:02.165 --> 00:11:05.293

shaving the outer walls

00:11:10.085 --> 00:11:12.653

reliability or gripping.

I'm just not sure the value yet.

940
01:08:56.015 --> 01:08:57.713
We were going through Concotilli's notes

941
01:08:57.715 --> 01:08:59.253
about Juliet and the antidote,

942
01:08:59.255 --> 01:09:01.473
which we're now calling Romeo, of course.

943
01:09:01.475 --> 01:09:03.413
Right, of course.

944
01:09:03.415 --> 01:09:05.503
We haven't been making any progress

945
01:09:05.505 --> 01:09:08.833
because we haven't had a
live sample to test from.

946
01:09:08.835 --> 01:09:09.835
Live sample?

947
01:09:11.935 --> 01:09:13.473
It's not a poison.

948
01:09:13.475 --> 01:09:16.563
It's a living virus that's
been genetically modified.

949
01:09:16.565 --> 01:09:19.223
It lies dormant in the host's system,

950
01:09:19.225 --> 01:09:20.057
and once activated,

951
01:09:20.059 --> 01:09:21.798
it's fatal within a few hours.

952
01:09:22.995 --> 01:09:27.193
The problem has been that
the virus dies with the host.

953
01:09:27.195 --> 01:09:30.533
And that's why you can't
find a living sample.

954
01:09:30.535 --> 01:09:33.043
Until yesterday.

955
01:09:33.045 --> 01:09:34.573
Well, we knew it needed
to be in liquid form

956
01:09:34.575 --> 01:09:36.513
from the notes so it could be injected

957
01:09:36.515 --> 01:09:37.793
or ingested through drink

958
01:09:37.795 --> 01:09:41.163
or transferred through bodily fluid,

959
01:09:41.165 --> 01:09:43.273
so the little girl that
was with the congressman

960
01:09:43.275 --> 01:09:44.873
should have been dead too.

961
01:09:44.875 --> 01:09:46.108
So why wasn't she?

962
01:09:47.185 --> 01:09:49.258
Because there was no pleasure.

963
01:09:52.925 --> 01:09:54.753
The virus lies dormant

964
01:09:54.755 --> 01:09:57.433
in the host's system until activated.

965
01:09:57.435 --> 01:09:59.333
Now we've learned that the triggers

966
01:09:59.335 --> 01:10:01.313
are oxytocin and dopamine,

967
01:10:01.315 --> 01:10:02.773
the very chemicals responsible

968
01:10:02.775 --> 01:10:05.653
for excitement and pleasure, respectively.

969
01:10:05.655 --> 01:10:07.403
Which the body manufactures

970
01:10:07.405 --> 01:10:09.583
in huge quantities during sex.

971
01:10:09.585 --> 01:10:11.033
Unless you're a young girl

972
01:10:11.035 --> 01:10:12.253
being forced by a congressman,

973
01:10:12.255 --> 01:10:14.803
in which case, there is only a milligram

974
01:10:14.805 --> 01:10:17.203
of dopamine being manufactured.

975
01:10:17.205 --> 01:10:18.583
Good God,

976
01:10:18.585 --> 01:10:20.673
so the virus is alive and dormant

977
01:10:20.675 --> 01:10:22.233
in the little girl.

978
01:10:22.235 --> 01:10:23.893
Yes,

979
01:10:23.895 --> 01:10:25.913
but now we have a live sample

980
01:10:25.915 --> 01:10:29.243
to use to synthesize a remedy from

981
01:10:29.245 --> 01:10:30.313
as soon as we figure out the rest

982
01:10:30.315 --> 01:10:32.433
of the equation from Concotilli's notes.

983
01:10:32.435 --> 01:10:34.433
We confiscated Richardson's
computer last night,

984
01:10:34.435 --> 01:10:35.435
so that should help.

985
01:10:36.405 --> 01:10:40.803
Ty, you said it has to
remain in liquid form.

986
01:10:40.805 --> 01:10:42.583
Can it be frozen?

987
01:10:42.585 --> 01:10:43.417
Not likely.

988
01:10:43.419 --> 01:10:44.883
It probably wouldn't survive.

989
01:10:44.885 --> 01:10:46.518
What about aerosolized?

990
01:10:48.795 --> 01:10:49.795

995
01:11:00.475 --> 01:11:01.863

at a commercial architectural
firm here in town.

but she was loyal,

1123
01:21:56.725 --> 01:21:57.903
and she was a friend,

1124
01:21:57.905 --> 01:21:59.763
and she was just slaughtered

1125
01:21:59.765 --> 01:22:02.053

and then you let her get away,

1129
01:22:06.395 --> 01:22:07.953
and when you finally brought her back in,

1130
01:22:07.955 --> 01:22:09.473
she's literally killing us

1131
01:22:09.475 --> 01:22:11.065

of us could have known

1136

1144
01:22:36.705 --> 01:22:37.823

had someone from the inside.

1296
01:36:03.815 --> 01:36:04.815
Megan?

1297
01:36:06.345 --> 01:36:09.193
Wow, what are you doing here?

1298
01:36:09.195 --> 01:36:10.463
I'm sorry.

1299
01:36:10.465 --> 01:36:11.768
The position was open.

1300
01:36:12.785 --> 01:36:15.178
Yeah, it's great to see you.

1301
01:36:18.785 --> 01:36:20.135
I hope you're doing okay.

1302
01:36:21.255 --> 01:36:22.438
Yeah, you too.

1304
01:36:27.165 --> 01:36:29.068
Wow, Megan.

1305
01:36:30.375 --> 01:36:32.014
I needed someone.

1306
01:36:32.016 --> 01:36:32.847
If you don't approve, you can...

1307
01:36:32.849 --> 01:36:33.849
No, it's fine.

1308
01:36:35.525 --> 01:36:37.238
Congratulations on the promotion.

1309
01:36:38.307 --> 01:36:40.013
Yeah, I don't think anybody else

1310
01:36:40.015 --> 01:36:42.498
wanted the job after Watts stepped down.

1311
01:36:43.485 --> 01:36:45.585
He really tainted the office, so to speak,

1312
01:36:46.495 --> 01:36:47.628
all the accusations.

1313
01:36:48.605 --> 01:36:49.953
Has he been convicted?

1314
01:36:49.955 --> 01:36:51.579
Of course not.

1315
01:36:51.581 --> 01:36:53.431
I mean, it never reaches that far up,

1316
01:36:54.695 --> 01:36:56.455
but then he'll never be back here either,

1317
01:36:56.457 --> 01:36:57.790
so we have that.

1318
01:37:02.945 --> 01:37:03.945
Jade.

1319
01:37:05.785 --> 01:37:07.493
I was thinking of recommending you

1320
01:37:07.495 --> 01:37:08.568
for my old position.

1321
01:37:09.705 --> 01:37:11.743
The Secretary will
probably accept my choice,

1322
01:37:11.745 --> 01:37:14.792
and there's not another agent
more qualified than you.

1323
01:37:15.789 --> 01:37:17.573
Of course, you'll have to
get used to the red tape,

1324
01:37:17.575 --> 01:37:19.866
but I know you can handle it.

1325
01:37:19.868 --> 01:37:21.023
Do you need some more time to think?

1326
01:37:21.025 --> 01:37:22.203
We can talk in a couple of days

1327
01:37:22.205 --> 01:37:24.193
when you have more questions.

1328
01:37:24.195 --> 01:37:25.345
Malcolm, I'm leaving.

1329
01:37:32.445 --> 01:37:34.089
Are you sure?

1330
01:37:34.091 --> 01:37:36.393
You have a home here.

1331
01:37:36.395 --> 01:37:37.833
You know I haven't really had a home

1332
01:37:37.835 --> 01:37:39.893
since I was 13,

1333
01:37:39.895 --> 01:37:42.073
but you've been good to me, Malcolm.

1334
01:37:42.075 --> 01:37:43.225
I'll never forget that,

1335
01:37:44.145 --> 01:37:45.998
and I hope you can forgive me.

1336
01:37:46.984 --> 01:37:49.401
There's nothing to forgive.

1337
01:37:50.785 --> 01:37:51.785
Just promise me

1338
01:37:52.689 --> 01:37:53.604
if you ever change your mind

1339
01:37:53.606 --> 01:37:55.255
you won't hesitate to come to me.

1340
01:37:57.351 --> 01:37:59.448
You have a place wherever I have a place.

1341
01:38:00.645 --> 01:38:02.171
Of course.

1342
01:38:02.173 --> 01:38:03.573
You know I'll keep in touch.

1343
01:38:17.185 --> 01:38:19.402
It's not polite to stare, Megan.
