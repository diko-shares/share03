00:01:47.215 --> 00:01:49.415
It's 6:42 a.m.

2
00:01:53.215 --> 00:01:55.255
Beth's Dad's place.

3
00:01:59.175 --> 00:02:00.925
He's out of town.

4
00:02:05.585 --> 00:02:07.925
And it's already a good day.

5
00:02:39.295 --> 00:02:40.795
Beth.

6
00:02:44.545 --> 00:02:46.505
- Rob, what are you doing?
- Nothing.

7
00:02:46.585 --> 00:02:48.215
- Well, then stop.
- Nothing.

8
00:02:48.295 --> 00:02:50.255
- That's...
- Stop it.

9
00:02:50.335 --> 00:02:51.755
She's shy.

10
00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:55.095
I could just see this
ending up on the Internet.

11
00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:57.755
Well, fine, cover up. See if I care.

12
00:02:57.835 --> 00:03:00.925
- I'm interested in other things.
- Like what?

13
00:03:05.005 --> 00:03:06.335
Like you.

14
00:03:10.835 --> 00:03:13.215
- Oh, man.
- That was close.

15
00:03:14.175 --> 00:03:16.715
Do it really... I'm scared of it.

16
00:03:16.795 --> 00:03:18.755
- It's only 30 minutes out.
- Shut up. I've never been.

17
00:03:18.835 --> 00:03:20.545
You've never been to Coney Island?

18
00:03:20.625 --> 00:03:22.135
Oh, how have you
never been to Coney Island?

19
00:03:22.215 --> 00:03:23.925
I don't know, I just... I've never been.

20
00:03:24.005 --> 00:03:25.925
Oh, that's... It's so much fun.
I'm taking you. We're going.

21
00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:27.255
Oh, my God.
You're so excited about this.

22
00:03:27.335 --> 00:03:28.415
- Yeah, I can't wait to...
- Give me this.

23
00:03:28.505 --> 00:03:29.755
What are you doing? What?

24
00:03:29.835 --> 00:03:31.585
Oh, all right. Well,
then from the neck up, okay?

25
00:03:31.675 --> 00:03:33.255
That's the only way I consent to this.

26
00:03:33.335 --> 00:03:34.885
Oh, please, Rob,
nobody's paying for that online.

27
00:03:34.965 --> 00:03:36.835
You've never been to
Twelve-Chest-Hairs. Com, have you?

28
00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:40.005
- Okay. What else?
- What else, what?

29
00:03:40.095 --> 00:03:42.215
Other than cotton candy
and Tilt-A-Whirls?

30
00:03:42.295 --> 00:03:46.215
- What do you want to do today?
- If I answer that...

31
00:03:47.545 --> 00:03:48.795
- All right, is this thing on?
- Look out!

32
00:03:48.885 --> 00:03:49.925
Babe, it's not my camera.

33
00:03:50.005 --> 00:03:51.625
I don't know if it's the on button
or the zoom button.

34
00:03:51.715 --> 00:03:53.375
All right. Here, here, here.
I think I got it. Is this on?

35
00:03:53.465 --> 00:03:56.095
Oh, perfect. And now we can have
a nice record of you getting run over.

36
00:03:56.175 --> 00:03:57.715
Is that funny?

37
00:03:58.795 --> 00:04:00.415
What time is everybody
starting to show up?

38
00:04:00.505 --> 00:04:01.545
- It's getting late here.
- A couple hours.

39
00:04:01.625 --> 00:04:04.465
- That's why we have to hurry.
- Where are we going?

40
00:04:04.545 --> 00:04:07.755
We're going... We're just going
around the corner to the store!

41
00:04:08.465 --> 00:04:10.045
I want you to go around
with your brother's camera

42
00:04:10.135 --> 00:04:12.005
and get testimonials from everyone.

43
00:04:12.095 --> 00:04:14.465
Why? I mean,
it's not like this is a wedding.

44
00:04:14.545 --> 00:04:17.715
I know it's not a wedding.
I said like a wedding.

45
00:04:18.005 --> 00:04:19.465
I can't get this.

46
00:04:19.545 --> 00:04:22.005
I don't get... I mean,
I don't understand why I have to do it.

47
00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:24.375
'Cause, I mean, I don't...
I don't even know how to work this...

48
00:04:24.835 --> 00:04:27.045
- That's what I think is gonna happen.
- No, I'm not!

49
00:04:27.135 --> 00:04:28.415
- You totally are. You...
- You have no clue!

50
00:04:28.755 --> 00:04:30.545
Okay, well, let me ask you a question.

51
00:04:30.625 --> 00:04:33.005
Can you see me through the viewfinder?

52
00:04:33.095 --> 00:04:34.755
Yeah. Got you.

53
00:04:34.835 --> 00:04:37.465
Good. Now can you see me trying
to carry these bags all by myself?

54
00:04:37.545 --> 00:04:38.835
You're doing a great job.

55
00:04:38.925 --> 00:04:41.255
Here, practice doing two things at once.

56
00:04:41.335 --> 00:04:43.215
- That's good! That was good.
- Thank you.

57
00:04:43.295 --> 00:04:44.335
I'm not lugging this thing around

58
00:04:44.415 --> 00:04:45.465
- all night long.
- He is your brother.

59
00:04:45.545 --> 00:04:46.625
This is important. Stop freaking out.

60
00:04:46.715 --> 00:04:47.715
I understand that, Lily, but it's a shit job!

61
00:04:47.795 --> 00:04:49.505
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is! I'm not doing it!

62
00:04:49.585 --> 00:04:51.835
Jason, I have been planning this
for two weeks!

63
00:04:51.925 --> 00:04:53.415
- All I want you to do is help me.
- Okay, babe, babe.

64
00:04:53.505 --> 00:04:56.415
Okay. All right? I'll do it. It's fine.

65
00:04:57.215 --> 00:04:59.095
I really pissed her off.

66
00:05:00.295 --> 00:05:03.334
Babe, come on.
I was just kidding! Come on!

67
00:05:03.335 --> 00:05:03.465
Babe, come on.
I was just kidding! Come on!

68
00:05:03.885 --> 00:05:07.375
Hud? Hud, listen to me.
I got a job for you.

69
00:05:07.925 --> 00:05:09.045
I already have got a job.

70
00:05:09.135 --> 00:05:10.335
- I'm doing the sign, so...
- Yeah, no. I see that,

71
00:05:10.415 --> 00:05:13.415
but this is more important than the sign.
You know how, like, at weddings,

72
00:05:13.505 --> 00:05:15.885
people give testimonials
to the camera, right?

73
00:05:15.965 --> 00:05:17.135
No.

74
00:05:17.465 --> 00:05:21.295
All right. You're gonna take the camera
and just, you know, go around the party

75
00:05:21.375 --> 00:05:23.215
and film people wishing Rob good luck.

76
00:05:23.295 --> 00:05:24.335
I don't know, man.

77
00:05:24.415 --> 00:05:25.715
- That's a lot of responsibility.
- This is important.

78
00:05:25.795 --> 00:05:26.835
And then you have
to do it the whole night...

79
00:05:26.925 --> 00:05:28.925
And Marlena's gonna be here.

80
00:05:29.005 --> 00:05:30.045
- She is?
- Oh, yeah. She is.

81
00:05:30.135 --> 00:05:31.375
- So you're gonna take that.
- Oh, hold on.

82
00:05:31.465 --> 00:05:32.755
- And you're gonna talk to her...
- I didn't...

83
00:05:32.835 --> 00:05:34.545
- For Rob.
- I didn't say I would do it.

84
00:05:34.625 --> 00:05:35.755
- Just try it out.
- All right, I'll do a few.

85
00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:37.965
You can, just do mine...

86
00:05:38.045 --> 00:05:39.215
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, go.

87
00:05:39.295 --> 00:05:40.675
All right.

88
00:05:41.795 --> 00:05:43.965
Rob, I don't even know what to say, bro.

89
00:05:44.045 --> 00:05:46.215
Best of luck in Japan.
I love you so much,

90
00:05:46.295 --> 00:05:48.545
and I'm proud of you.

91
00:05:50.925 --> 00:05:52.255
- That's it.
- That's it?

92
00:05:52.335 --> 00:05:56.505
- Yeah. Easy enough.
- Yeah. It's actually kind of fun.

93
00:05:57.835 --> 00:05:59.925
- You enjoy it, Hud.
- Thanks, man.

94
00:06:00.005 --> 00:06:01.095
Yeah, I'm doing...

95
00:06:02.465 --> 00:06:03.585
Hey, what's up, man?

96
00:06:03.675 --> 00:06:05.505
Hey, guys? Hey.

97
00:06:06.505 --> 00:06:07.505
- What do we say?
- Anything.

98
00:06:07.585 --> 00:06:11.005
Bon voyage, Rob.
Or however you say that in Japanese.

99
00:06:12.335 --> 00:06:15.335
Yeah, good.
Oh, yeah, all right. Oh, yeah...

100
00:06:15.415 --> 00:06:17.715
- Hud, what are you doing?
- I'm documenting the night.

101
00:06:17.795 --> 00:06:19.545
But I thought I asked Jason to do that.

102
00:06:19.625 --> 00:06:23.095
Oh, yeah, well, Jason asked me to do it,
so I've been doing it.

103
00:06:23.175 --> 00:06:24.295
I've been doing it really well.

104
00:06:24.375 --> 00:06:25.675
Well, are you gonna
take it seriously, though?

105
00:06:25.755 --> 00:06:27.135
Because it's really important.

106
00:06:27.215 --> 00:06:29.505
No, of course. I've been taking it
really, really seriously.

107
00:06:29.585 --> 00:06:30.625
- Very seriously.
- You promise?

108
00:06:30.715 --> 00:06:33.465
Yeah, you wanna do
your testimonial now?

109
00:06:33.885 --> 00:06:35.175
- Okay.
- Yeah, do it right now.

110
00:06:35.255 --> 00:06:36.295
Okay.

111
00:06:36.375 --> 00:06:37.965
Okay, just open up to him,
'cause this is gonna be

112
00:06:38.045 --> 00:06:40.175
- the last thing he sees you...
- Okay, Hud, I got it.

113
00:06:40.255 --> 00:06:42.005
Robert Hawkins,

114
00:06:42.095 --> 00:06:45.295
I can't believe you're leaving me
to look after your brother by myself.

115
00:06:45.375 --> 00:06:49.375
Oh! Easy, easy. I mean
I'm obviously standing right here...

116
00:06:49.465 --> 00:06:52.295
And I know we're not officially family,
yet, but...

117
00:06:52.375 --> 00:06:54.095
- Not fair, 'cause I'm gonna...
- Dude.

118
00:06:54.175 --> 00:06:56.335
- Okay.
- I'll cut him out later.

119
00:06:56.415 --> 00:07:01.465
But I think of you as my brother,
and I hope you think of me as a sister.

120
00:07:01.545 --> 00:07:03.925
So, you better call us.

121
00:07:04.885 --> 00:07:08.585
Now that you have this job,
you can afford to call us, so...

122
00:07:08.675 --> 00:07:10.585
- Hud?
- Yeah.

123
00:07:10.675 --> 00:07:12.415
Yeah, sorry. No, you're good.
You're good. You're good.

124
00:07:12.505 --> 00:07:13.505
- That was good!
- That's it?

125
00:07:13.585 --> 00:07:14.625
I thought that was really, really good.

126
00:07:14.715 --> 00:07:16.755
Yeah, but you weren't even paying
attention for...

127
00:07:26.505 --> 00:07:29.965
Okay. Okay, you can do this.

128
00:07:31.375 --> 00:07:35.175
Yeah. You got this, man. You got this.

129
00:07:40.415 --> 00:07:42.885
- What's up, man?
- Hey, what's up, dude?

130
00:07:42.965 --> 00:07:44.095
What's up?

131
00:07:48.335 --> 00:07:51.005
Excuse me! Hey, Marlena?

132
00:07:51.095 --> 00:07:53.045
- Hey, what's up?
- Hi. Hi.

133
00:07:53.135 --> 00:07:54.795
Hey, did you know that I'm going around

134
00:07:54.925 --> 00:07:57.505
the party and I'm...
Do you know Rob's leaving?

135
00:07:57.585 --> 00:07:59.885
- Like it's his going-away party.
- Yeah. Yeah.

136
00:07:59.965 --> 00:08:05.255
Cool. Hey, so we're taping,
I think, people talking about him.

137
00:08:05.335 --> 00:08:08.095
Oh, no, thank you.
I barely even know Rob.

138
00:08:08.175 --> 00:08:10.545
I'm just coming to say hi to Lily,
so it's a little weird,

139
00:08:10.625 --> 00:08:12.095
if I'm even on it, I think, but thanks.

140
00:08:12.175 --> 00:08:15.045
Okay, cool,
except I'm supposed to get everybody.

141
00:08:15.135 --> 00:08:18.045
So have you ever been to a wedding?

142
00:08:18.135 --> 00:08:21.295
No, I get what you're doing. I just...
I don't want to do it, but thank you.

143
00:08:21.375 --> 00:08:24.715
Okay, cool.
We'll just do a short one real quick.

144
00:08:30.715 --> 00:08:31.965
Okay.

145
00:08:33.295 --> 00:08:35.795
Hey, Rob, Marlena.

146
00:08:36.255 --> 00:08:39.625
I think we've met, like,
probably three times before, total,

147
00:08:39.715 --> 00:08:42.835
and every one of those times
I was really drunk,

148
00:08:42.925 --> 00:08:45.925
so I don't really even know what to say.

149
00:08:46.005 --> 00:08:47.885
But you have a cool job!
That's something!

150
00:08:47.965 --> 00:08:50.215
- Like you're president of something!
- Vice president!

151
00:08:50.295 --> 00:08:51.755
Also really cool.

152
00:08:51.835 --> 00:08:54.925
So good luck with that
and we're gonna be here

153
00:08:55.005 --> 00:08:58.335
keeping New York really safe
and fun for you when you come back.

154
00:08:58.415 --> 00:09:00.295
- Cool, that was a really good one.
- Yeah?

155
00:09:00.375 --> 00:09:02.045
Yeah, we can do
another one if you want.

156
00:09:03.005 --> 00:09:04.885
Do you actually have,
like a card or something?

157
00:09:04.965 --> 00:09:08.135
Well, my agency... We're leaving.
We're going on this stupid retreat

158
00:09:08.215 --> 00:09:09.465
and they like all this video,

159
00:09:09.545 --> 00:09:11.005
- like, bonding crap.
- Oh, yeah. I'm actually...

160
00:09:11.095 --> 00:09:12.755
- I'm not a professional.
- What?

161
00:09:12.835 --> 00:09:15.415
- I'm not a professional. I'm Hud.
- Hug?

162
00:09:15.505 --> 00:09:19.045
No, no, no, Hud.
I'm Rob and Lily's friend.

163
00:09:19.135 --> 00:09:22.465
- We met, like, several times before.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

164
00:09:22.545 --> 00:09:24.585
Yeah, you have the camera
in front of your face,

165
00:09:24.675 --> 00:09:26.415
- it's probably why I didn't...
- Okay, here. If I move it?

166
00:09:26.505 --> 00:09:28.675
- Oh, yeah. What's going on? Totally.
- Yeah.

167
00:09:28.755 --> 00:09:30.545
Yeah, cool. It's nice to see you again.

168
00:09:30.625 --> 00:09:34.715
- Really good to see you. Really good.
- So what have you been up to?

169
00:09:34.795 --> 00:09:36.965
I actually... I'm gonna just go
grab some food,

170
00:09:37.045 --> 00:09:38.295
but good luck with the...

171
00:09:38.375 --> 00:09:41.005
I could still do your
agency's retreat if you wanted...

172
00:09:41.095 --> 00:09:41.255
He's coming up the stairs right now.
Everybody get ready. Get ready.

173
00:09:41.256 --> 00:09:43.885
He's coming up the stairs right now.
Everybody get ready. Get ready.

174
00:09:43.965 --> 00:09:46.755
Can someone turn down
the music, please?

175
00:09:50.835 --> 00:09:53.095
Surprise! Surprise!

176
00:09:56.625 --> 00:09:58.375
No, no, no, no, no, no!

177
00:10:00.505 --> 00:10:02.175
How did you guys plan all this?

178
00:10:02.255 --> 00:10:04.715
Easy, you're naive. Let's go.

179
00:10:04.795 --> 00:10:06.335
- Hey. How are you?
- Take this. Take this.

180
00:10:06.415 --> 00:10:08.585
- I'm sorry. Yes. Thank you.
- What's up?

181
00:10:08.675 --> 00:10:10.835
Oh, hey. Yes. Good.

182
00:10:10.925 --> 00:10:12.215
- What's up, man?
- Speech!

183
00:10:12.295 --> 00:10:15.375
- Yeah, speech! Speech!
- Speech! Speech!

184
00:10:18.755 --> 00:10:21.215
- Oh, this is very surprising...
- I hope so.

185
00:10:21.295 --> 00:10:22.965
- Obviously.
- It's a surprise party.

186
00:10:23.045 --> 00:10:24.295
Yeah.

187
00:10:24.925 --> 00:10:28.505
But it's very sweet. So thank you. Lily?

188
00:10:28.585 --> 00:10:29.675
It was everyone. It was everyone.

189
00:10:29.755 --> 00:10:33.175
No, thank you, everyone.
Thank you. It's...

190
00:10:33.255 --> 00:10:37.095
Oh, it means a lot, so... That's it.
That's all I got. I don't know.

191
00:10:37.175 --> 00:10:39.965
- Have a good time!
- Yeah, party!

192
00:10:40.045 --> 00:10:41.255
Yeah!

193
00:10:41.545 --> 00:10:46.755
- Hey, man. Were you surprised?
- Yo. I was, like, not even surprised.

194
00:10:46.835 --> 00:10:48.675
No? Can you describe your current
emotions right now?

195
00:10:48.755 --> 00:10:52.335
I don't know. I would say blasé.
Like, I'm a little... I'm just a little bored.

196
00:10:52.415 --> 00:10:55.885
- No, you're not. Well, congrats.
- No, man, that was awesome, dude.

197
00:10:55.965 --> 00:10:57.375
What are you doing
with the video camera

198
00:10:57.465 --> 00:10:58.545
- by the way?
- I'm documenting the night

199
00:10:58.625 --> 00:11:00.135
so that you can take it
to Japan with you.

200
00:11:00.215 --> 00:11:01.295
Oh, can I watch it every night

201
00:11:01.375 --> 00:11:02.375
- when I get there?
- Jason asked if I...

202
00:11:02.465 --> 00:11:03.465
- Yeah, you could.
- Oh, good.

203
00:11:04.045 --> 00:11:06.375
All right, thank you. Cool.

204
00:11:07.255 --> 00:11:09.885
Hey, Hud, do you know
if Beth's coming tonight?

205
00:11:09.965 --> 00:11:13.465
Yeah, I guess. I'm sure Lily invited her.
Why wouldn't she be here?

206
00:11:27.925 --> 00:11:29.255
So how are you
gonna survive without Rob?

207
00:11:29.335 --> 00:11:31.045
- He's like your main dude.
- Yeah, I know.

208
00:11:31.135 --> 00:11:32.715
Hey, how am I gonna
survive without you?

209
00:11:32.795 --> 00:11:35.415
- I don't know. I'm like your main dude.
- Straight up.

210
00:11:37.545 --> 00:11:41.045
- As I make my... I'm not here.
- Hi, Hud.

211
00:11:41.135 --> 00:11:43.255
I'm just documenting. Not here.

212
00:11:43.335 --> 00:11:44.925
That was my biggest problem
is that she picked him...

213
00:11:45.005 --> 00:11:47.755
You know what.
No, but when he said My Fair Lady...

214
00:11:47.835 --> 00:11:50.755
- I love My Fair Lady.
- I was like, "Really?"

215
00:11:50.835 --> 00:11:53.925
That was wonderful.
But, I mean, it worked out, right?

216
00:11:54.005 --> 00:11:57.415
Beth, hey! You made it.

217
00:11:57.505 --> 00:11:59.135
It doesn't matter, dude, you're here.
All is well.

218
00:11:59.215 --> 00:12:00.295
Oh, no, it's good. It's good.

219
00:12:00.375 --> 00:12:04.005
- Enjoy it. Have fun.
- Oh, I will. I'm just gonna go say...

220
00:12:05.045 --> 00:12:06.465
- Who is that guy?
- I don't know. He's random.

221
00:12:06.545 --> 00:12:09.135
Here, I'm gonna go check it out.
Look out, documenting.

222
00:12:09.215 --> 00:12:10.215
Oh, thanks.

223
00:12:10.295 --> 00:12:12.465
- I missed your surprise.
- Oh, that's okay.

224
00:12:12.545 --> 00:12:14.715
I'm sorry. No, we had cab problems.
I'm really sorry.

225
00:12:14.795 --> 00:12:16.375
- That's fine.
- Decorating's mine.

226
00:12:16.465 --> 00:12:19.585
- No, that's fantastic.
- Rob, this is Travis.

227
00:12:19.675 --> 00:12:20.795
- Hi.
- Hi. Oh, pleasure.

228
00:12:20.885 --> 00:12:22.255
I've heard a lot about you.

229
00:12:22.335 --> 00:12:23.885
- Congratulations, by the way.
- Thank you.

230
00:12:23.965 --> 00:12:25.415
- Vice President. That's fantastic.
- I love your dress.

231
00:12:25.505 --> 00:12:26.835
- Thank you. I love yours.
- Yeah, thank you.

232
00:12:26.925 --> 00:12:28.585
That's really amazing.

233
00:12:28.675 --> 00:12:29.795
- Should we...
- Yeah, there's a buffet.

234
00:12:29.885 --> 00:12:31.835
Hey, I'm documenting the night.
I'm Hud.

235
00:12:31.925 --> 00:12:33.175
- Okay.
- So, there's tons of sake.

236
00:12:33.255 --> 00:12:35.045
Yeah, just help yourselves, enjoy.

237
00:12:35.135 --> 00:12:36.465
- Enjoy, everybody.
- It's good to meet you.

238
00:12:36.545 --> 00:12:39.465
- Have a good one, yeah.
- Thanks for coming.

239
00:12:40.505 --> 00:12:41.965
- I think he just said I was cute.
- Are they dating?

240
00:12:42.045 --> 00:12:43.215
Yeah.

241
00:13:04.375 --> 00:13:07.095
- Hey, is everything cool, man?
- Yeah, everything's cool.

242
00:13:07.175 --> 00:13:10.465
Okay, because... I don't know,
because you been over here kind of...

243
00:13:10.545 --> 00:13:12.625
Is that my camera?

244
00:13:12.715 --> 00:13:14.175
I don't know. Your brother gave it to me.

245
00:13:14.255 --> 00:13:16.505
Did you switch the tape?
Because I had a tape in there.

246
00:13:16.585 --> 00:13:17.625
I don't know. Was...

247
00:13:17.925 --> 00:13:20.335
Roller-coasters are fun, but, like,
any kind of tea-cuppy thing...

248
00:13:20.415 --> 00:13:23.465
Tape was in here when I got it. Why?

249
00:13:25.675 --> 00:13:27.045
- Rob, why?
- No, it doesn't matter.

250
00:13:27.135 --> 00:13:29.135
It doesn't... It's stupid.

251
00:13:29.215 --> 00:13:31.545
Okay, are you sure you're cool?
Because you're really weirding me out.

252
00:13:31.625 --> 00:13:34.795
Like, we haven't been
hanging out or anything.

253
00:13:35.295 --> 00:13:39.045
- Here. Here, man. Come on.
- All right, cool. That's more like it.

254
00:13:39.135 --> 00:13:41.625
Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.

255
00:13:42.925 --> 00:13:44.885
- What's wrong with you?
- Hey, Beth! Beth. Beth. Beth.

256
00:13:44.965 --> 00:13:48.715
Hey, I'm filming goodbyes for Rob.
Do you want to say something?

257
00:13:48.795 --> 00:13:53.675
Oh, Hud, I don't know.
It's not a really good time right now.

258
00:13:53.755 --> 00:13:54.885
Come on, he's leaving.

259
00:13:54.965 --> 00:13:56.255
- I mean, can we...
- I know.

260
00:13:56.335 --> 00:13:57.675
You're not gonna be able
to talk to him for a while.

261
00:13:57.755 --> 00:14:00.135
Isn't there something you wanna say?

262
00:14:02.925 --> 00:14:04.795
You know what?
Travis, can you get me a drink?

263
00:14:04.885 --> 00:14:06.755
- Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, of course.
- Is that... Okay.

264
00:14:06.835 --> 00:14:08.375
Cool, thanks.

265
00:14:09.175 --> 00:14:11.755
Okay, let's... Right here? I don't...

266
00:14:11.835 --> 00:14:13.415
- No, we can do it in the kitchen.
- Okay, perfect.

267
00:14:13.505 --> 00:14:14.625
Okay.

268
00:14:16.545 --> 00:14:17.715
Okay.

269
00:14:19.885 --> 00:14:21.175
Rob,

270
00:14:23.415 --> 00:14:26.005
I didn't want to do this on camera.

271
00:14:26.585 --> 00:14:32.505
But, I just... I just want you to know
how happy I am for you,

272
00:14:33.255 --> 00:14:36.295
because I know how hard
you've worked for this job

273
00:14:36.375 --> 00:14:39.095
and I know how much it means
to you and...

274
00:14:41.335 --> 00:14:43.585
And I'm really gonna miss you.

275
00:14:43.965 --> 00:14:46.885
Hey. Can I talk to you for a second?

276
00:14:53.095 --> 00:14:57.095
Jason? There's something totally weird
going on with Rob and Beth.

277
00:14:57.175 --> 00:14:59.295
- What are you talking about?
- I'm serious. They're right outside.

278
00:14:59.375 --> 00:15:02.254
- Hud! Not now.
- Okay. I'll check it out.

279
00:15:02.255 --> 00:15:02.335
- Hud! Not now.
- Okay. I'll check it out.

280
00:15:02.625 --> 00:15:03.835
You never even called me, Rob!

281
00:15:03.925 --> 00:15:05.465
You go and bring some guy to my party?

282
00:15:05.545 --> 00:15:07.795
Hold on! You haven't
talked to me in weeks!

283
00:15:08.585 --> 00:15:09.585
- Hud, man! Come on!
- Sorry!

284
00:15:09.675 --> 00:15:12.045
- What? What?
- I got it. I got it. Hud, get back inside.

285
00:15:12.135 --> 00:15:14.965
- But I'm documenting!
- Not this.

286
00:15:15.045 --> 00:15:17.795
Lily, do you know what
they were fighting about?

287
00:15:17.885 --> 00:15:19.715
Lily, if you know,
you have to tell me. Lily!

288
00:15:19.795 --> 00:15:20.925
I'm not telling you.

289
00:15:21.005 --> 00:15:23.625
I really should know,
as the guy documenting this.

290
00:15:23.715 --> 00:15:24.715
She was the one
who brought me back inside.

291
00:15:24.795 --> 00:15:26.885
- Okay, fine. We'll go find out.
- I'm positive. I promise.

292
00:15:26.965 --> 00:15:28.835
- We'll ask her. We'll go find out.
- She's in the kitchen.

293
00:15:28.925 --> 00:15:30.885
- What?
- Lil!

294
00:15:31.755 --> 00:15:33.255
Lil, do you have something to tell us?

295
00:15:33.375 --> 00:15:34.465
- No.
- You do, don't you?

296
00:15:34.545 --> 00:15:35.505
- What? No.
- Hud, you're a genius.

297
00:15:35.585 --> 00:15:37.835
- You're dodging the question right now.
- There is nothing to tell you.

298
00:15:37.925 --> 00:15:38.965
- Nothing.
- Liar.

299
00:15:39.045 --> 00:15:40.715
Lily, if you know something,
you have to tell us.

300
00:15:40.795 --> 00:15:41.835
- No.
- Look at me.

301
00:15:41.925 --> 00:15:44.045
- Lily.
- I know you. Babe.

302
00:15:45.505 --> 00:15:47.375
Okay, fine, but not on camera.
I'm not telling you on camera.

303
00:15:47.465 --> 00:15:48.755
Okay, that's not a problem.
All right, no problem.

304
00:15:48.835 --> 00:15:50.335
Why would we say anything?

305
00:15:50.415 --> 00:15:51.965
- We won't say anything.
- Rob and Beth slept together.

306
00:15:52.045 --> 00:15:53.715
- Are you serious?
- It happened a few weeks ago.

307
00:15:53.795 --> 00:15:55.295
Beth made me promise
not to say anything.

308
00:15:55.375 --> 00:15:56.375
Are you kidding me, Lily?

309
00:15:56.465 --> 00:15:58.135
Rob and Beth sleep together,
you're not gonna tell me?

310
00:15:58.215 --> 00:16:01.505
- Why wouldn't you tell me?
- Why wouldn't I tell you?

311
00:16:01.795 --> 00:16:03.625
Okay, you guys,
don't ask me where I heard this.

312
00:16:03.715 --> 00:16:06.415
Rob and Beth totally had sex together.

313
00:16:06.925 --> 00:16:08.295
- I knew it.
- Are you kidding me?

314
00:16:08.375 --> 00:16:10.415
No, I'm not kidding.
This is extremely serious.

315
00:16:11.095 --> 00:16:12.135
Hey, Marlena.

316
00:16:12.215 --> 00:16:13.585
- It's me, Hud, from before.
- Hi. Right.

317
00:16:13.675 --> 00:16:16.335
Did you know
that Rob and Beth had sex?

318
00:16:16.415 --> 00:16:18.005
- No.
- Yeah, isn't that crazy?

319
00:16:18.095 --> 00:16:19.175
- They've been friends forever.
- Crazy.

320
00:16:19.255 --> 00:16:21.335
I mean, Rob's been in love
with her since college.

321
00:16:21.415 --> 00:16:24.885
Well, maybe it was like
a going-away present, you know?

322
00:16:24.965 --> 00:16:27.925
Yeah. Wait, were we supposed
to get presents?

323
00:16:28.465 --> 00:16:29.715
- They did. They had sexual intercourse.
- What?

324
00:16:29.795 --> 00:16:30.885
- Lily told me.
- No way.

325
00:16:30.965 --> 00:16:32.045
- No, you are so...
- No, I promise.

326
00:16:32.135 --> 00:16:33.175
Why do you make up stuff like that?

327
00:16:33.255 --> 00:16:34.585
- No, I do not. I have a nice car.
- You make shit up.

328
00:16:34.675 --> 00:16:36.545
I didn't say what kind...

329
00:16:36.625 --> 00:16:37.835
Hey.

330
00:16:46.295 --> 00:16:50.095
- Good luck in Japan, Rob.
- Good luck tonight, Travis.

331
00:16:54.135 --> 00:16:56.135
Hey, dude. Dude, dude, dude.
Are you all right, man?

332
00:16:56.215 --> 00:16:58.045
- Hey. Come on.
- This is not the time, Hud.

333
00:16:58.135 --> 00:16:59.375
- What is it, man?
- Let him go.

334
00:16:59.465 --> 00:17:01.255
- We should talk to him.
- We're not talking to him.

335
00:17:01.335 --> 00:17:02.585
I could talk to him now.

336
00:17:02.675 --> 00:17:04.295
Dude, you already talked
to the whole party!

337
00:17:04.375 --> 00:17:06.755
Have to do something.
- No. Everyone needs to just calm down

338
00:17:06.835 --> 00:17:07.925
- and give him space.
- He's just gonna stay

339
00:17:08.005 --> 00:17:09.755
- locked in his room all night?
- Lily, look at you.

340
00:17:09.835 --> 00:17:11.545
- It's fine, trust me.
- It is not fine.

341
00:17:11.625 --> 00:17:13.255
- It is fine.
- You are his brother.

342
00:17:13.335 --> 00:17:16.675
You are his best friend.
Go and make him happy.

343
00:17:16.755 --> 00:17:19.335
So, how do you wanna do this?
Do you wanna do most of the talking,

344
00:17:19.415 --> 00:17:20.885
or do you want me
to do most of the talking?

345
00:17:20.965 --> 00:17:22.925
- You're not doing any talking.
- Okay, cool.

346
00:17:23.005 --> 00:17:24.095
We got to talk.

347
00:17:24.175 --> 00:17:25.175
You don't know
what you're talking about,

348
00:17:25.255 --> 00:17:27.415
- all right?
- Okay, well, then tell me.

349
00:17:27.505 --> 00:17:29.755
It was just a spur-of-the-moment thing.

350
00:17:29.835 --> 00:17:32.095
Yeah, well, Beth told Lori
that after you guys got together,

351
00:17:32.175 --> 00:17:33.585
- you totally blew her off.
- I didn't blow her off!

352
00:17:33.675 --> 00:17:34.715
She said you never called her.

353
00:17:34.795 --> 00:17:37.295
Look, I'm leaving, all right?
So what am I supposed to do?

354
00:17:37.375 --> 00:17:39.005
I don't know, man.
She was heartbroken.

355
00:17:39.095 --> 00:17:42.505
Look, there's no "together." It's just
her and me, two separate things.

356
00:17:42.585 --> 00:17:43.715
It's better if we just stay friends.

357
00:17:43.795 --> 00:17:45.465
Not that I feel like I'm not
good enough for her!

358
00:17:45.545 --> 00:17:47.505
No, stop, stop!
I didn't say "feel," Rob.

359
00:17:47.585 --> 00:17:49.215
You're not good enough for her.

360
00:17:49.295 --> 00:17:52.135
That's it. That's fact. That's science.

361
00:17:52.215 --> 00:17:55.885
Beth Mclntyre is, like,
from a whole 'nother planet, man.

362
00:17:55.965 --> 00:17:59.965
She's beautiful. She's charming.
And you... I love you,

363
00:18:00.045 --> 00:18:02.295
but let's face it,
you're kind of a douchebag.

364
00:18:02.375 --> 00:18:07.095
And going to Japan is not gonna fix that.
She's crazy about you, bro.

365
00:18:07.175 --> 00:18:10.375
- Like, right now, as you are.
- And you're in love with her.

366
00:18:10.465 --> 00:18:12.135
- But you got to go after her.
- It's not that simple.

367
00:18:12.215 --> 00:18:14.465
- No, it is that simple, Rob.
- Come on, man. Don't be scared.

368
00:18:14.545 --> 00:18:16.755
It's about moments, man.
That's all that...

369
00:18:16.835 --> 00:18:19.135
You got to learn to say,
"Forget the world,"

370
00:18:19.215 --> 00:18:21.795
and hang on to the people
that you care about the most.

371
00:18:22.585 --> 00:18:26.835
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, my God. What the hell was that?

372
00:18:30.505 --> 00:18:32.625
That scared the shit out of me.

373
00:18:32.715 --> 00:18:35.295
Lil! Lil!

374
00:18:35.375 --> 00:18:37.175
Did you feel that?
It was like an earthquake.

375
00:18:37.255 --> 00:18:38.335
- You guys...
- Lil, where are you?

376
00:18:38.415 --> 00:18:40.175
- What was that?
- What was that?

377
00:18:40.255 --> 00:18:41.755
- Hey. Are you all right?
- Oh, my God.

378
00:18:41.835 --> 00:18:43.175
- Yeah, that was really scary.
- Did you see anything?

379
00:18:43.255 --> 00:18:45.965
Hey, Marlena! Marlena, are you okay?

380
00:18:46.045 --> 00:18:47.215
Guys, look out!

381
00:18:48.175 --> 00:18:49.335
- Okay.
- It was like a bomb.

382
00:18:49.415 --> 00:18:51.505
All right, here we go. Here we go.
Here we go. Here we go.

383
00:18:51.585 --> 00:18:53.675
Wait. Everyone quiet down. All right?

384
00:18:53.755 --> 00:18:54.925
- But now, just approximately...
- Shut up, shut up.

385
00:18:55.005 --> 00:18:57.505
15 minutes after word...
- Guys! Come on.

386
00:18:57.585 --> 00:19:00.005
Of a possible earthquake
in lower Manhattan.

387
00:19:00.095 --> 00:19:05.375
Nearby, in New York Harbor, we're
getting word of an oil tanker capsizing

388
00:19:05.465 --> 00:19:08.965
in the middle of the harbor
near the Statue of Liberty.

389
00:19:09.045 --> 00:19:10.505
- Once again...
- Dude, that's really close.

390
00:19:10.585 --> 00:19:12.755
There's no way to know if any...
- That's really, really close.

391
00:19:12.835 --> 00:19:14.755
That's true. Do you think
we could see something from the roof?

392
00:19:14.835 --> 00:19:17.335
- I don't know. Maybe.
- J, wanna go to the roof?

393
00:19:17.415 --> 00:19:18.585
Let's go see if we can see
something on the roof.

394
00:19:18.675 --> 00:19:19.885
Come on, Jason.
We're not going up to the roof.

395
00:19:19.965 --> 00:19:23.095
- Yeah, let's go up there.
- I don't think we should.

396
00:19:23.675 --> 00:19:25.714
- No!
- That was really...

397
00:19:25.715 --> 00:19:25.835
- No!
- That was really...

398
00:19:27.215 --> 00:19:29.215
What do you think?
Think it's another terrorist attack?

399
00:19:29.295 --> 00:19:32.215
- It's insane, man.
- Watch your step.

400
00:19:41.295 --> 00:19:43.215
It was shaking everywhere, man.
Just like tremors.

401
00:19:43.295 --> 00:19:45.965
- Yeah, it's on the news downstairs.
- Is this the only lights that went out?

402
00:19:46.045 --> 00:19:47.625
- I think they blew up the trains.
- No, a couple did.

403
00:19:47.715 --> 00:19:52.045
- Some stayed on.
- Oh, man. What is going on?

404
00:19:52.135 --> 00:19:54.215
Maybe you should've left town
a little bit earlier, right?

405
00:19:54.295 --> 00:19:55.585
Shut up.

406
00:19:57.045 --> 00:19:58.465
Oh, my God!

407
00:20:00.625 --> 00:20:01.795
No, no, no.

408
00:20:02.505 --> 00:20:04.795
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

409
00:20:08.295 --> 00:20:10.375
Hud. Move. Hud!

410
00:20:25.885 --> 00:20:27.755
Oh, God.

411
00:20:28.675 --> 00:20:32.215
- Rob, you got a set of keys?
- Get out of here!

412
00:20:33.335 --> 00:20:34.835
Right, did you look back?
Did anybody get hurt?

413
00:20:34.925 --> 00:20:37.625
- Did anybody see Jason or not?
- I don't know.

414
00:20:37.715 --> 00:20:40.755
Did anybody see Jason?
Has anybody seen Jason?

415
00:20:40.835 --> 00:20:43.675
- Did anybody see Jason?
- Is he inside?

416
00:20:47.925 --> 00:20:51.045
Oh, my God! Oh! Oh, shit!

417
00:20:51.135 --> 00:20:53.095
Oh, Jesus Christ!

418
00:20:53.175 --> 00:20:57.465
- Oh, God! Oh, God!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

419
00:20:59.755 --> 00:21:01.215
Oh, my God!

420
00:21:12.545 --> 00:21:14.625
You gotta take your stuff
and we gotta get out of here, man!

421
00:21:14.715 --> 00:21:15.925
I'm telling you!

422
00:21:16.005 --> 00:21:17.835
- I'm so sorry.
- Where were you?

423
00:21:25.755 --> 00:21:29.375
Hey, did you guys see that?
Did you guys just see that?

424
00:21:42.375 --> 00:21:44.465
Go! Let's go!

425
00:21:48.625 --> 00:21:52.375
- Hey, get down! Get down!
- You all right? You all right?

426
00:21:52.465 --> 00:21:53.965
Yeah, did you guys see that?

427
00:21:54.045 --> 00:21:57.465
- Did you guys see that?
- You all right?

428
00:22:01.135 --> 00:22:03.295
There are people still out there.

429
00:22:12.795 --> 00:22:16.255
Rob! Rob! Hey, Rob, I saw it! Rob!

430
00:22:17.465 --> 00:22:19.005
- Rob.
- What?

431
00:22:19.095 --> 00:22:20.045
- Rob, I saw it!
- What?

432
00:22:20.135 --> 00:22:22.255
- What's he saying?
- It's alive.

433
00:22:32.715 --> 00:22:35.505
Stay down, Lily! Get back!

434
00:22:42.835 --> 00:22:44.465
He's going away now.

435
00:22:44.835 --> 00:22:46.925
- Jason, what are you doing?
- Jason, where are you going?

436
00:22:47.005 --> 00:22:48.675
Lily, just wait.

437
00:22:50.175 --> 00:22:52.005
- Jason, don't go out...
- Jason, don't!

438
00:22:52.095 --> 00:22:53.415
Lily, just wait here!

439
00:22:53.505 --> 00:22:55.585
Hey, Rob! Rob!
Where's he going, dude?

440
00:22:55.675 --> 00:22:58.585
- Jason!
- Rob. Rob!

441
00:23:19.545 --> 00:23:22.415
- Oh, my God. Marlena?
- Oh, God.

442
00:23:22.505 --> 00:23:25.925
Are you okay?
Wait, come here. Come here. Sit down.

443
00:23:46.885 --> 00:23:49.135
It walked right through
that street over there.

444
00:23:49.215 --> 00:23:51.755
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
It walked right over my head.

445
00:23:51.835 --> 00:23:54.965
- What?
- That's the sound it's making.

446
00:23:55.045 --> 00:23:57.255
You said you saw something, right?
So what did you see?

447
00:23:57.335 --> 00:23:59.625
- You said it was alive? What was it?
- Who cares what it...

448
00:23:59.715 --> 00:24:03.415
I don't know, man. I don't know.
I mean, I was taping. I can show you.

449
00:24:03.505 --> 00:24:05.545
Hey, you guys! I have it on tape!

450
00:24:05.625 --> 00:24:08.795
- Well, then rewind it. Rewind it.
- Yeah. Here, here. Let me rewind it...

451
00:24:08.965 --> 00:24:10.215
It's gonna be a great opportunity for you.

452
00:24:10.295 --> 00:24:11.835
Yeah, but I don't even
speak the language.

453
00:24:11.925 --> 00:24:13.335
Oh, come on. How hard could it be?

454
00:24:13.415 --> 00:24:16.295
It's Japanese. It's Japanese-hard.

455
00:24:18.005 --> 00:24:21.255
- It'll be fine.
- Do you really think I should go?

456
00:24:22.095 --> 00:24:23.135
- Oh, my God.
- That makes no sense.

457
00:24:23.215 --> 00:24:26.005
- That makes no sense.
- Did you see it?

458
00:24:26.095 --> 00:24:28.215
I don't know what it was, of course!
It was giant.

459
00:24:28.295 --> 00:24:30.715
It was like... Did you see that thing?

460
00:24:30.795 --> 00:24:32.835
- I'm not yelling at you, all right?
- Yes, you are!

461
00:24:32.925 --> 00:24:34.835
Hey, guys, guys, come on!
Everybody just calm down!

462
00:24:34.925 --> 00:24:37.375
- Quiet, guys.
- All right. Come on, just shut up!

463
00:24:37.465 --> 00:24:40.215
All right? We don't know what we saw!
The point is it's still here!

464
00:24:40.295 --> 00:24:42.585
All right? So we need to get
the hell out of Manhattan!

465
00:24:42.675 --> 00:24:44.335
- Now.
- Yeah, yeah.

466
00:24:44.415 --> 00:24:46.135
And out to the Brooklyn Bridge.
I think it's the best plan.

467
00:24:46.215 --> 00:24:48.175
- It's a straight shot to Delancey.
- Just take the Williamsburg.

468
00:24:48.255 --> 00:24:50.215
No. Do you know how far that is?
Brooklyn is right there.

469
00:24:50.295 --> 00:24:52.835
No, no, no, dude. It's so much closer.
It's right here.

470
00:24:52.925 --> 00:24:54.885
- Center Street's like a block away.
- What's going on?

471
00:24:54.965 --> 00:24:57.585
I think we're gonna get out of here.
Is she okay to...

472
00:24:57.675 --> 00:25:00.375
Okay, yeah. Yeah, okay. Marlena,
we're gonna get out of here, okay?

473
00:25:00.465 --> 00:25:03.375
It was eating people.
It was eating everyone.

474
00:25:04.795 --> 00:25:07.215
We gotta go! Go! Let's go!

475
00:25:07.625 --> 00:25:08.625
Okay, come here.

476
00:25:08.715 --> 00:25:11.415
- Go, go, go, go, go.
- I don't think... Don't even look.

477
00:25:16.755 --> 00:25:18.295
- Is anyone's phone working?
- What?

478
00:25:18.375 --> 00:25:19.835
- Hud, is your phone working?
- What?

479
00:25:19.925 --> 00:25:22.505
- No...
- Shit! I left it in the apartment.

480
00:25:22.585 --> 00:25:24.095
- There's no signal.
- You're not getting a signal either?

481
00:25:24.175 --> 00:25:25.545
No, no, come on.

482
00:25:25.625 --> 00:25:27.375
- Hud, come on!
- What? Okay.

483
00:25:37.465 --> 00:25:39.175
It's all right.

484
00:25:39.295 --> 00:25:40.335
Let's go.

485
00:25:40.675 --> 00:25:41.675
We need an IV.

486
00:25:41.755 --> 00:25:42.925
- Calm down, please.
- Let's go, people.

487
00:25:43.005 --> 00:25:44.295
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Excuse me, Officer.

488
00:25:44.375 --> 00:25:45.965
Do you know...
What was that thing? What was it?

489
00:25:46.045 --> 00:25:47.625
Look, if you're not injured,
you got to keep moving, man.

490
00:25:47.715 --> 00:25:50.585
Let's go! Let's go, people! Let's go!

491
00:25:50.675 --> 00:25:53.045
Yeah, once we get to the bridge,
we'll be safe.

492
00:25:53.135 --> 00:25:56.045
Hey, how are you? Is she doing better?

493
00:25:56.135 --> 00:25:57.885
She's okay. She's gonna be fine.

494
00:25:57.965 --> 00:26:01.255
- Marlena, you saw it. What was that?
- Not now, Hud.

495
00:26:03.175 --> 00:26:04.505
Sorry.

496
00:26:08.545 --> 00:26:11.175
Please go in an orderly manner.

497
00:26:11.255 --> 00:26:14.045
Continue moving south
towards Brooklyn.

498
00:26:14.135 --> 00:26:16.795
- Just keep going.
- Yeah, I don't know. It got hit.

499
00:26:18.545 --> 00:26:20.925
Once we get over there,
I'll go to my cousin's house.

500
00:26:21.005 --> 00:26:22.675
She has a condo. She's out of town.

501
00:26:27.625 --> 00:26:31.045
I repeat, do not stop. Keep moving.

502
00:26:32.045 --> 00:26:34.375
There will be instructions
on the Brooklyn side...

503
00:26:35.215 --> 00:26:40.545
Get across the bridge.
Move in a quick and orderly fashion.

504
00:26:50.795 --> 00:26:52.335
- You still filming?
- Yeah.

505
00:26:52.415 --> 00:26:55.585
People are gonna wanna know
how it all went down.

506
00:26:56.415 --> 00:26:58.335
Well, you can just tell them
how it all went down, Hud.

507
00:26:58.415 --> 00:26:59.965
No, that wouldn't work.

508
00:27:00.045 --> 00:27:03.545
People need to see this, you know?
This is gonna be important.

509
00:27:03.625 --> 00:27:05.215
I mean, people are gonna watch this.

510
00:27:05.295 --> 00:27:07.295
- Beth? Beth?
- Rob!

511
00:27:08.715 --> 00:27:12.255
Beth, I've been trying to reach you.
Are you okay? Hello?

512
00:27:12.585 --> 00:27:16.375
Wait a second, you guys!
Look, hey! Lily, stop!

513
00:27:17.675 --> 00:27:19.625
I'm sorry. It's really loud here.
Can you speak up?

514
00:27:19.715 --> 00:27:20.925
Lily!

515
00:27:22.255 --> 00:27:24.465
- What?
- Rob got a hold of Beth.

516
00:27:24.545 --> 00:27:26.465
Wait! Jason, wait!

517
00:27:26.625 --> 00:27:28.625
- Rob's got Beth on the phone!
- What'd you say?

518
00:27:28.715 --> 00:27:30.795
- What?
- Hey, y'all, come on.

519
00:27:30.885 --> 00:27:32.505
Rob's got Beth on the phone!

520
00:27:32.585 --> 00:27:35.415
Okay, Beth, you're gonna
have to calm down, okay?

521
00:27:35.505 --> 00:27:38.755
Where are you?
What do you mean, you can't move?

522
00:27:39.215 --> 00:27:41.675
- What?
- I repeat, no panicking.

523
00:27:47.175 --> 00:27:49.135
Did you see it?

524
00:28:05.375 --> 00:28:08.005
- Jason!
- Can you see anything?

525
00:28:08.095 --> 00:28:09.545
No, I can't get over there!

526
00:28:09.625 --> 00:28:11.835
I can't... I can't see anything!
Can you see it?

527
00:28:11.925 --> 00:28:13.585
Jason!

528
00:28:13.675 --> 00:28:15.755
- Why did you stop?
- Jason!

529
00:28:15.835 --> 00:28:17.885
- What?
- Jason, watch out!

530
00:28:23.795 --> 00:28:27.835
Jason! No, Jason! No!

531
00:28:31.005 --> 00:28:32.255
Jason!

532
00:28:33.545 --> 00:28:38.215
- No, no! God! No, Jason! Jason!
- Lily, come on!

533
00:28:38.295 --> 00:28:39.835
Jason! No!

534
00:28:57.545 --> 00:28:59.585
Go, go, go, go!

535
00:29:26.005 --> 00:29:31.255
Lily. Lily, wait. Stop! Turn around
and listen to me right now.

536
00:29:31.335 --> 00:29:33.335
Would somebody please,
please tell me what just happened?

537
00:29:33.415 --> 00:29:36.255
- I don't know.
- I mean, it came out of nowhere!

538
00:29:36.375 --> 00:29:37.965
And he was there
and then he was gone!

539
00:29:38.045 --> 00:29:41.675
- My God! Jason! Jason!
- Lily, I'm so, so sorry.

540
00:29:41.755 --> 00:29:45.095
Rob. You got to listen to me, man.
I am so sorry about your brother.

541
00:29:45.175 --> 00:29:49.625
I'm sorry, man. I'm so sorry.
Are you okay? Rob?

542
00:29:52.295 --> 00:29:55.135
Oh, shit. Oh, shit!

543
00:29:57.465 --> 00:30:00.375
- Rob. Rob, dude.
- We can't stay here.

544
00:30:00.885 --> 00:30:03.795
- We can't.
- Rob. We got to get out of here, man.

545
00:30:03.885 --> 00:30:07.095
Listen to me.
We got... We got to get moving, man.

546
00:30:07.175 --> 00:30:08.715
We go to the Manhattan Bridge,
you know?

547
00:30:08.795 --> 00:30:10.545
We got to get out of here.
It's not safe here.

548
00:30:10.625 --> 00:30:13.045
Okay, we can go to the other side.
We can try and get

549
00:30:13.135 --> 00:30:16.295
to the Lincoln Tunnel.
I don't know, man. I don't know, but...

550
00:30:16.375 --> 00:30:19.885
Dude, we got to get out of here.
It's not safe here.

551
00:30:21.005 --> 00:30:24.135
What are we gonna do, Rob?
What are we gonna do?

552
00:30:26.135 --> 00:30:27.715
Do you know? Hey!

553
00:30:28.965 --> 00:30:31.965
Look... Hey, Jesus. Rob. Hey, Rob?

554
00:30:32.585 --> 00:30:33.965
- No.
- Rob!

555
00:30:34.045 --> 00:30:36.045
- My battery's dead.
- Yeah, dude, I...

556
00:30:36.135 --> 00:30:38.925
Well, listen, we got
to get out of here, man. You know?

557
00:30:39.005 --> 00:30:40.215
- Rob! Rob!
- Well, where's he going?

558
00:30:40.295 --> 00:30:41.795
Where are you going?

559
00:30:41.885 --> 00:30:44.545
Oh, God. I'll go get him. Hey, Rob!

560
00:30:46.095 --> 00:30:50.755
Rob! Dude!
I can't take all this running, man!

561
00:30:52.465 --> 00:30:53.795
Hey, Rob.

562
00:30:54.625 --> 00:30:57.255
Excuse me. Hey, Rob!
The store's closed, man!

563
00:30:57.335 --> 00:30:59.625
- Rob, Rob!
burning right now.

564
00:30:59.965 --> 00:31:03.675
The bridge was filled
with pedestrians traveling across.

565
00:31:03.755 --> 00:31:05.005
- It has collapsed.
- Holy shit.

566
00:31:05.095 --> 00:31:07.005
No word on injuries yet, but...

567
00:31:09.005 --> 00:31:10.465
Oh, God.

568
00:31:13.835 --> 00:31:16.465
We continue now with our breaking
news story in lower Manhattan.

569
00:31:16.545 --> 00:31:20.375
We are getting some truly extraordinary
live images here in the studio.

570
00:31:20.465 --> 00:31:21.675
For those of you just joining us,

571
00:31:21.755 --> 00:31:24.375
lower Manhattan is
in an absolute state of siege

572
00:31:24.465 --> 00:31:26.095
in what has been...

573
00:31:31.585 --> 00:31:34.625
This is a mandatory evacuation.

574
00:31:34.715 --> 00:31:37.135
Proceed south immediately.

575
00:31:37.215 --> 00:31:40.505
Get out of the city in an orderly fashion.

576
00:31:40.585 --> 00:31:45.465
This is a mandatory evacuation!
We need everyone out of this area now!

577
00:31:45.545 --> 00:31:46.885
Rob? Rob! Hey, dude!

578
00:31:46.965 --> 00:31:49.095
Actually, I think we need to get out
of here, like, right now!

579
00:31:49.175 --> 00:31:50.335
Do you know what I'm saying?
Because there's some

580
00:31:50.415 --> 00:31:53.835
serious shit going on outside!
Rob? No, like, you know what I mean?

581
00:31:53.925 --> 00:31:56.885
Rob, like, there's some strange
shit going on! Rob?

582
00:31:58.255 --> 00:31:59.465
Donna Martel is near the scene
at City Hall.

583
00:31:59.545 --> 00:32:00.795
What's going on?

584
00:32:00.885 --> 00:32:02.795
Can you tell us what it looks like
on the ground there?

585
00:32:02.885 --> 00:32:06.135
Well, Bob, the military will not
let us get too close,

586
00:32:06.215 --> 00:32:09.675
but from what we can see,
there's clearly a sizable mobilization

587
00:32:09.755 --> 00:32:11.045
of troops and equipment,

588
00:32:11.135 --> 00:32:13.005
and they're trying to get everyone
to leave the area...

589
00:32:13.095 --> 00:32:15.255
To be honest, Tom, your guess
is as good as mine at this point.

590
00:32:15.335 --> 00:32:17.625
There appears to be
something coming off of it.

591
00:32:17.715 --> 00:32:19.885
And the ground seems
to be covered in debris...

592
00:32:19.965 --> 00:32:21.625
It looks like there's something
falling of it, doesn't it?

593
00:32:21.715 --> 00:32:23.465
Yes. Yes. Yes, it does.

594
00:32:23.545 --> 00:32:25.835
There are pieces falling
all over the street.

595
00:32:25.925 --> 00:32:27.675
- Oh, my God.
- Whatever they are, they are moving.

596
00:32:27.755 --> 00:32:28.795
- Oh, my God! They're...
- Donna!

597
00:32:28.885 --> 00:32:29.965
- They're right there!
- Oh, shit.

598
00:32:30.045 --> 00:32:32.005
- Donna, can you hear us?
- Hey!

599
00:32:32.095 --> 00:32:34.175
What are you doing?
We got to get out of here! Where is he?

600
00:32:34.255 --> 00:32:35.295
I know, that's what I've been telling him.

601
00:32:35.375 --> 00:32:36.585
- Rob! Rob!
- I've been trying to do that!

602
00:32:36.675 --> 00:32:38.415
Rob. Rob. We gotta go right now, okay?

603
00:32:38.505 --> 00:32:41.255
- The military's evacuating everyone.
- Hey, Rob, listen to me, okay?

604
00:32:41.335 --> 00:32:42.465
We gotta get out of here.

605
00:32:42.545 --> 00:32:44.965
- It's time to leave the electronics store.
- Rob, come on. We got to go.

606
00:32:45.045 --> 00:32:46.335
- Just come on. Let's go...
- Just stop it!

607
00:32:46.415 --> 00:32:47.965
Okay? Stop, wait!

608
00:32:48.675 --> 00:32:51.095
To listen to your messages...

609
00:32:53.585 --> 00:32:59.255
Rob! Rob! I can't...
Oh, God! I can't move.

610
00:33:00.965 --> 00:33:04.585
It fell. My apartment...
The whole wall fell on me!

611
00:33:06.005 --> 00:33:09.965
I'm bleeding! I'm bleeding. I can't move.

612
00:33:10.375 --> 00:33:12.045
Oh, my God.

613
00:33:15.335 --> 00:33:17.545
Help me, Rob.

614
00:33:17.625 --> 00:33:20.005
To delete this message...

615
00:33:33.675 --> 00:33:35.255
Rob, wait up! Rob!

616
00:33:35.335 --> 00:33:37.755
I got your message,
and I'm on my way there, okay?

617
00:33:37.795 --> 00:33:40.295
Hey, Rob, listen.
You got to think this through, man.

618
00:33:40.375 --> 00:33:43.755
Okay? Beth lives in Midtown.
Midtown is that way.

619
00:33:43.835 --> 00:33:45.095
- Guess what else is that way?
- Will you wait up?

620
00:33:45.175 --> 00:33:47.585
- Some horrific shit is in Midtown!
- This is insane, okay?

621
00:33:47.675 --> 00:33:49.545
We're not gonna go
near that thing, okay?

622
00:33:49.625 --> 00:33:51.415
We're not gonna go
to the middle of the city!

623
00:33:51.505 --> 00:33:53.135
No, we're not.
You're not coming with me.

624
00:33:53.215 --> 00:33:55.045
Look. Fall in with the military.
Fall in with the crowd.

625
00:33:55.135 --> 00:33:56.465
Let them escort you out of here.

626
00:33:56.545 --> 00:33:57.675
Okay?

627
00:33:58.255 --> 00:34:00.005
- Rob!
- I'm sorry. I got to go.

628
00:34:00.095 --> 00:34:01.585
Rob!

629
00:34:01.675 --> 00:34:03.835
- Rob! Listen!
- Rob, wait a minute!

630
00:34:03.925 --> 00:34:05.545
One of us is gonna have to tackle you,

631
00:34:05.625 --> 00:34:08.175
and that's gonna be very uncomfortable
for everybody involved!

632
00:34:08.255 --> 00:34:09.585
Listen, you can't talk me out of it, okay?

633
00:34:09.675 --> 00:34:13.255
Look at me. This is not me crazy.
All right? I know what I'm doing.

634
00:34:13.335 --> 00:34:14.375
And you can't talk me out of it.

635
00:34:14.465 --> 00:34:17.005
- So turn around, go...
- I'm coming.

636
00:34:17.755 --> 00:34:19.545
I'm coming with you.

637
00:34:20.375 --> 00:34:21.625
Lily, you don't have to do that.

638
00:34:21.715 --> 00:34:24.835
- No, I want to. I'm coming.
- Guys, did you not hear her message?

639
00:34:24.925 --> 00:34:26.715
I mean, even if we get to Beth's,
there's a chance

640
00:34:26.795 --> 00:34:28.675
- that she's already...
- Shut up.

641
00:34:33.625 --> 00:34:34.835
Guys, this is insane.

642
00:34:34.925 --> 00:34:37.505
- Rob!
- You know what I'm talking about, right?

643
00:34:37.585 --> 00:34:38.885
You can't possibly think
that this is a good idea.

644
00:34:38.965 --> 00:34:40.095
Rob! Rob!

645
00:34:40.175 --> 00:34:42.175
- Rob!
- Hey... Hold...

646
00:34:44.715 --> 00:34:46.795
I'm sorry, I don't understand you.

647
00:34:46.885 --> 00:34:49.755
Yeah, but I don't understand you.
Rob, hold up!

648
00:34:50.295 --> 00:34:51.885
Look, I'm sorry. Hey, listen to me. Man.

649
00:34:51.965 --> 00:34:53.465
- Hud!
- I'm so sorry.

650
00:34:53.545 --> 00:34:55.135
Hey, Rob! Wait up, please!

651
00:34:55.215 --> 00:34:57.175
Rob! Have you tried maybe calling 911,

652
00:34:57.255 --> 00:34:59.005
- see if somebody else can get there?
- Yeah, I tried!

653
00:34:59.095 --> 00:35:01.505
Okay, well. I mean, what about police?
Fire department?

654
00:35:01.585 --> 00:35:04.715
- I couldn't get through! I tried, I...
- Okay, it just seems a little...

655
00:35:06.585 --> 00:35:09.135
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my God!

656
00:35:38.625 --> 00:35:40.545
Oh! Oh, my God.

657
00:35:45.375 --> 00:35:47.375
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

658
00:35:49.045 --> 00:35:53.095
Rob! Rob! Hey, Rob!

659
00:36:00.885 --> 00:36:03.885
- Hud! We're gonna go this way!
- I can't hear you!

660
00:36:03.965 --> 00:36:06.795
- Subway!
- What? What?

661
00:36:07.965 --> 00:36:09.715
- Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
- Come on! Come on!

662
00:36:09.795 --> 00:36:12.095
This shit is crazy, dude!

663
00:36:20.925 --> 00:36:22.504
Oh, Rob, dude. There's like...

664
00:36:22.505 --> 00:36:23.375
Oh, Rob, dude. There's like...

665
00:36:27.175 --> 00:36:29.375
Hud! Hud!

666
00:36:29.465 --> 00:36:31.415
Are you okay, man? You all right?

667
00:36:31.505 --> 00:36:33.885
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm all right.
- Come on.

668
00:36:33.965 --> 00:36:37.465
- Okay. Okay. Oh, God damn.
- Oh, shit.

669
00:36:44.505 --> 00:36:46.335
What the hell was that?

670
00:36:47.965 --> 00:36:52.045
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
- Did you see that?

671
00:36:52.135 --> 00:36:54.885
- Oh, my God. Oh, God.
- Did you see that?

672
00:37:13.415 --> 00:37:14.625
Okay.

673
00:37:17.415 --> 00:37:20.625
Hey, look. We can just cross...
We can just cross to the other platform,

674
00:37:20.715 --> 00:37:22.755
then go up the stairs and see
if the other side of the street...

675
00:37:22.835 --> 00:37:25.005
Rob, the other side of the street
looks the same as this side!

676
00:37:25.095 --> 00:37:27.095
We can wait for there to be a lull,
and then make a break for it!

677
00:37:27.175 --> 00:37:29.095
Rob, the air caught on fire!
Okay? There's not gonna be a lull!

678
00:37:29.175 --> 00:37:30.465
But if we wait on the other...

679
00:37:30.545 --> 00:37:33.295
Listen to me, man,
I am with you, okay? I really, really am.

680
00:37:33.375 --> 00:37:36.885
I'm just saying, you gotta listen
to what's going on up there.

681
00:37:38.215 --> 00:37:39.885
- We can't...
- Rob, he's right, okay?

682
00:37:39.965 --> 00:37:42.375
We have to wait. We have to wait.

683
00:37:45.295 --> 00:37:46.885
This is insane.

684
00:37:51.925 --> 00:37:53.095
Shit!

685
00:38:10.755 --> 00:38:15.005
- Oh, God.
- What? Rob, what?

686
00:38:18.335 --> 00:38:19.625
Hey, Mom.

687
00:38:20.885 --> 00:38:24.795
Yeah, no. I'm okay. Okay, yeah, we are.

688
00:38:24.885 --> 00:38:27.625
We're being evacuated right now.
The army's here.

689
00:38:27.715 --> 00:38:31.885
We're being evacuated, so don't worry.
Okay, but Mom... Mom, listen.

690
00:38:33.295 --> 00:38:38.925
We tried to get out of the city,
and we took the Brooklyn Bridge,

691
00:38:39.625 --> 00:38:42.215
and we were right there when it hit.

692
00:38:43.965 --> 00:38:47.965
Jason's dead. Jason's dead, Mom.

693
00:39:45.135 --> 00:39:47.465
I don't know what to say to him.

694
00:39:49.835 --> 00:39:51.255
You know?

695
00:39:53.715 --> 00:39:56.335
Like, I feel like I should say something,

696
00:39:57.465 --> 00:39:59.675
but I don't know what to say.

697
00:40:17.965 --> 00:40:20.375
I'm not even supposed to be here.

698
00:40:22.375 --> 00:40:25.585
You didn't have to be. I mean,

699
00:40:27.095 --> 00:40:29.675
you had your chance in the alley.

700
00:40:30.255 --> 00:40:32.045
You could've left us.

701
00:40:34.795 --> 00:40:39.255
Yeah, you were supposed to meet up
with some friends or something, right?

702
00:40:40.585 --> 00:40:41.715
Yeah.

703
00:40:43.625 --> 00:40:45.005
I'm sorry.

704
00:40:48.505 --> 00:40:50.005
- This isn't a bad idea.
- Just walk.

705
00:40:50.095 --> 00:40:52.375
- Wait, so then...
- What's going on?

706
00:40:52.465 --> 00:40:53.965
I don't know.

707
00:41:00.675 --> 00:41:02.415
Just go across here.
- That's good.

708
00:41:02.505 --> 00:41:04.415
Yeah. This is the six.

709
00:41:04.505 --> 00:41:06.175
Rob, I don't think the trains
are running right now, man.

710
00:41:06.255 --> 00:41:08.335
- No, we can just walk the track, see?
- Yeah.

711
00:41:08.415 --> 00:41:09.925
Look. Beth lives here, Columbus Circle.

712
00:41:10.005 --> 00:41:12.715
We can just walk down the six
to Lexington and then walk down

713
00:41:12.795 --> 00:41:15.795
- Central Park South.
- You want us to walk in the tunnels?

714
00:41:15.885 --> 00:41:18.135
It's either that or stay here.

715
00:41:20.135 --> 00:41:22.095
I'll walk the tunnels.

716
00:41:32.255 --> 00:41:33.415
I can't see.

717
00:41:33.505 --> 00:41:36.835
- It's kind of freaking me out, you know?
- I think there's a light on the camera.

718
00:41:36.925 --> 00:41:38.415
- Let me see.
- There is?

719
00:41:38.505 --> 00:41:40.925
Yeah, right here. See?

720
00:41:46.215 --> 00:41:47.335
Okay.

721
00:42:00.175 --> 00:42:02.005
Ocean is big, dude.

722
00:42:02.335 --> 00:42:03.925
All I'm saying is a couple of years ago,

723
00:42:04.005 --> 00:42:06.005
they found a fish in Madagascar
that they thought

724
00:42:06.095 --> 00:42:08.095
- had been extinct for centuries.
- So what?

725
00:42:08.175 --> 00:42:10.095
It's been down there this whole time,
and nobody noticed?

726
00:42:10.175 --> 00:42:13.255
Sure. Maybe it erupted
from an ocean trench, you know?

727
00:42:13.335 --> 00:42:16.795
Or a crevasse. Crevice.
It's just a theory.

728
00:42:16.885 --> 00:42:19.925
I mean, for all we know,
it's from another planet and it flew here.

729
00:42:20.005 --> 00:42:22.585
- Like Superman?
- Yeah, exactly like...

730
00:42:22.675 --> 00:42:24.835
Wait. You know who Superman is?

731
00:42:24.925 --> 00:42:28.585
Oh, my God.
You know who Superman is?

732
00:42:28.675 --> 00:42:31.255
- Okay, I'm not...
- I'm, like, feeling something.

733
00:42:31.335 --> 00:42:33.335
- Are you aware of Garfield?
- A lot of people think

734
00:42:33.415 --> 00:42:35.045
he's from a planet
that he's not actually from.

735
00:42:35.135 --> 00:42:37.465
I just can't stop thinking about how
the last thing I said to her was,

736
00:42:37.545 --> 00:42:39.675
"Good luck tonight, Travis."

737
00:42:41.335 --> 00:42:43.585
She knows you didn't mean that.

738
00:42:45.625 --> 00:42:48.505
When I think of some of the things
I said to Jason...

739
00:42:48.585 --> 00:42:50.795
- No, that's different.
- Why?

740
00:42:52.885 --> 00:42:54.885
Jason knew you loved him.

741
00:43:06.925 --> 00:43:09.795
Hey, do you guys remember
a couple of years ago, when that guy

742
00:43:09.885 --> 00:43:12.005
was lighting homeless people
on fire in the subways?

743
00:43:12.095 --> 00:43:13.625
- Jesus, Hud.
- What?

744
00:43:13.715 --> 00:43:16.465
It's maybe not the best topic
for conversation down here.

745
00:43:16.545 --> 00:43:17.755
Right.

746
00:43:21.925 --> 00:43:24.585
I just can't stop thinking how scary
it would be if a flaming homeless guy

747
00:43:24.675 --> 00:43:25.885
- came out of the dark right now.
- Hud, seriously.

748
00:43:25.965 --> 00:43:28.095
- Seriously.
- I'm just saying. Sorry.

749
00:43:31.885 --> 00:43:35.095
- What was that?
- Let's just keep moving.

750
00:43:35.925 --> 00:43:39.375
Holy shit! Oh, God, this is nasty.

751
00:43:43.755 --> 00:43:45.415
This is disgusting.

752
00:43:45.505 --> 00:43:47.335
They're all running
in the same direction.

753
00:43:47.415 --> 00:43:50.295
- Yeah, like they're running away.
- From what?

754
00:43:58.045 --> 00:43:59.885
Hey, how much farther?

755
00:43:59.965 --> 00:44:01.835
I don't know.
Let's get out at the next station.

756
00:44:01.925 --> 00:44:03.295
- Okay?
- Yeah.

757
00:44:04.215 --> 00:44:06.465
Did you guys hear that?

758
00:44:07.375 --> 00:44:09.465
- What is that?
- Just listen.

759
00:44:11.295 --> 00:44:14.215
I don't see anything. Do you guys?

760
00:44:17.715 --> 00:44:20.335
- Oh, man, this is the worst.
- Will you be quiet for five seconds?

761
00:44:20.415 --> 00:44:22.795
- Oh, turn on the night vision.
- What?

762
00:44:22.885 --> 00:44:24.215
- What do you mean?
- It's right here.

763
00:44:24.295 --> 00:44:26.965
I got it. It's right here. There.

764
00:44:30.175 --> 00:44:31.375
Is it on?

765
00:44:31.465 --> 00:44:33.835
- Oh, shit.
- What? What?

766
00:44:33.925 --> 00:44:36.045
- Run. Okay, run. Okay, run.
- What?

767
00:44:36.135 --> 00:44:38.715
Hey, let's start running! Just run!
Just run! Just start running right now!

768
00:44:38.795 --> 00:44:43.255
Start running now! Run, run, run!
Run! Just run!

769
00:44:43.335 --> 00:44:45.255
- Lily!
- You guys!

770
00:44:48.835 --> 00:44:50.215
Wait.

771
00:44:53.835 --> 00:44:57.335
Oh, God! Help!
Please help! You guys, help!

772
00:45:08.795 --> 00:45:11.505
Marlena! Here!

773
00:45:12.755 --> 00:45:15.505
Come on. Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

774
00:45:19.175 --> 00:45:20.295
Hud!

775
00:45:29.175 --> 00:45:31.625
There you go.
- Totally not what I was thinking...

776
00:45:46.545 --> 00:45:48.585
How are you doing over there, Marlena?

777
00:45:48.675 --> 00:45:50.215
You okay?

778
00:45:51.835 --> 00:45:53.255
You tell me.

779
00:45:55.175 --> 00:45:56.755
How does it look?

780
00:45:57.755 --> 00:45:59.545
Looks like it hurts.

781
00:46:00.045 --> 00:46:02.965
What do you mean? You're saying
this isn't attractive, like, at all?

782
00:46:03.045 --> 00:46:04.045
A little bit.

783
00:46:12.295 --> 00:46:16.045
- Here. Here, here. You can wash it off.
- Thanks.

784
00:46:16.135 --> 00:46:19.295
Here. Did it get you, Hud?
Did it bite you, man?

785
00:46:19.375 --> 00:46:21.095
No, it didn't get me.

786
00:46:22.135 --> 00:46:23.505
Okay. Okay.

787
00:46:27.095 --> 00:46:29.335
Hey. Hey.

788
00:46:30.415 --> 00:46:32.005
So those things
came out of nowhere, right?

789
00:46:32.095 --> 00:46:34.045
- Yeah.
- Oh, man.

790
00:46:35.835 --> 00:46:38.545
That one that grabbed me,
it was trying to drag me away.

791
00:46:38.625 --> 00:46:40.135
What's up with that?

792
00:46:42.625 --> 00:46:45.415
- Maybe it liked you, Hud.
- Yeah.

793
00:46:45.965 --> 00:46:48.715
Maybe it was trying
to make me its queen.

794
00:46:52.885 --> 00:46:58.715
Hey, thanks for coming back
and helping me out, you know?

795
00:47:00.215 --> 00:47:03.625
What? You think that I'm the kind
of person that wouldn't do that?

796
00:47:03.715 --> 00:47:07.295
No. No. I know you aren't.

797
00:47:08.465 --> 00:47:12.585
I was just saying, like, I'm glad you did.

798
00:47:16.965 --> 00:47:19.715
Otherwise,
I would have been totally dead.

799
00:47:20.675 --> 00:47:21.835
Right?

800
00:47:22.415 --> 00:47:24.585
It's okay. You just got bit.

801
00:47:25.885 --> 00:47:26.925
Hey.

802
00:47:27.335 --> 00:47:31.375
Marlena's hurt pretty bad, you know?

803
00:47:31.795 --> 00:47:33.835
Well, we could wait here
for a little bit, I guess,

804
00:47:33.925 --> 00:47:36.005
and just hope those things
don't make it through the door.

805
00:47:36.095 --> 00:47:38.005
- Yeah, okay. What's the next option?
- Well.

806
00:47:38.095 --> 00:47:40.835
Okay, we could see
what's out through this way.

807
00:47:40.925 --> 00:47:44.005
- Maybe find another tunnel.
- No, no more tunnels.

808
00:47:44.885 --> 00:47:48.045
Then, I don't know.
We try our luck up top.

809
00:47:48.625 --> 00:47:52.715
Okay, just to be clear,
so our options are

810
00:47:52.795 --> 00:47:57.375
die here, die in the tunnels,
or die in the streets. Is that...

811
00:47:57.465 --> 00:47:59.675
- Yeah, pretty much.
pretty much the summing up of it?

812
00:47:59.755 --> 00:48:01.215
But wait, we don't even know
where we are, right?

813
00:48:01.295 --> 00:48:05.505
So, let's just go up and look around.
See if we recognize anything.

814
00:48:07.255 --> 00:48:09.005
Do you think you'll be okay to walk?

815
00:48:09.095 --> 00:48:10.545
- No, I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Here, I'll help you.

816
00:48:33.415 --> 00:48:34.585
- We're at 59th.
- We're at 59th.

817
00:48:34.675 --> 00:48:36.415
- Yeah.
- We're at 59th.

818
00:48:49.415 --> 00:48:50.885
That's weird.

819
00:48:52.885 --> 00:48:53.965
What?

820
00:48:59.095 --> 00:49:00.215
Yeah.

821
00:49:15.255 --> 00:49:15.795
Hello!

822
00:49:15.795 --> 00:49:16.505
Hello!

823
00:49:33.095 --> 00:49:34.465
Marlena?

824
00:49:34.795 --> 00:49:36.925
- What's wrong?
- Are you okay?

825
00:49:38.715 --> 00:49:40.175
I'm really... I'm dizzy.

826
00:49:40.255 --> 00:49:43.005
Yeah. Do you wanna
sit down for a second?

827
00:49:46.375 --> 00:49:48.215
- No, I'm fine.
- She needs a doctor.

828
00:49:48.295 --> 00:49:49.375
- You sure?
- I'm totally fine.

829
00:49:49.465 --> 00:49:50.885
You know, 'cause we could
sit down if you want to.

830
00:49:50.965 --> 00:49:51.965
No, I'm fine, I'm fine.

831
00:49:52.045 --> 00:49:54.585
We've got civilians!
Are there any more of you?

832
00:49:54.675 --> 00:49:56.005
- No, just us four.
- It's just us.

833
00:49:56.095 --> 00:49:57.625
We got four civilians here.

834
00:49:58.175 --> 00:50:00.045
- Okay, bring them in.
- Roger.

835
00:50:00.135 --> 00:50:02.375
- Let's go, move. Move it.
- Okay, okay.

836
00:50:04.295 --> 00:50:06.715
- Let's go!
- Okay, okay.

837
00:50:09.375 --> 00:50:12.505
Excuse me, sir? Sir? Excuse me.

838
00:50:12.585 --> 00:50:15.135
Listen, we need your help.
Our friend, she's hurt. She's trapped

839
00:50:15.215 --> 00:50:16.755
in her building right by here,
at Columbus Circle.

840
00:50:16.835 --> 00:50:18.215
That is not
where you wanna be right now.

841
00:50:18.295 --> 00:50:20.755
Do you guys know what it is? Out there?
Do you know what that thing is?

842
00:50:20.835 --> 00:50:24.255
If they know, they ain't telling me.
Whatever it is, it's winning.

843
00:50:33.585 --> 00:50:35.175
- What's up?
- We got another bite here.

844
00:50:36.375 --> 00:50:38.045
Don't look at that. Gross.

845
00:50:41.135 --> 00:50:42.795
- Please, we can't stay here. We have...
- Hey, not now.

846
00:50:42.885 --> 00:50:44.335
- Copy that.
- Sir, we have two F-18s

847
00:50:44.415 --> 00:50:46.045
on route from Selfridge.
Four more are arming up,

848
00:50:46.135 --> 00:50:48.625
- maybe 30 minutes out.
- Roger that.

849
00:50:48.715 --> 00:50:51.675
Listen up, people.
Rack them and pack them.

850
00:50:51.755 --> 00:50:53.925
- We're phantoms in 15.
- Sir.

851
00:50:54.005 --> 00:50:55.925
- Where the hell did you find them?
- They were in the tunnels.

852
00:50:56.005 --> 00:50:58.045
Yeah, we had to walk all the way
from Spring Street.

853
00:50:58.135 --> 00:51:00.505
Get them ready for transport,
put them on the evac chopper.

854
00:51:00.545 --> 00:51:02.625
- Yes, sir. Let's move. Move, move.
- No, wait. Wait.

855
00:51:02.715 --> 00:51:03.965
- Listen, our friend is very badly hurt.
- Move it.

856
00:51:04.045 --> 00:51:05.095
- Move. Move.
- We have to get to her.

857
00:51:05.175 --> 00:51:06.465
Sorry, son, can't help you.
Get them on the chopper.

858
00:51:06.545 --> 00:51:09.045
No, but, please, listen to me. Let go!
Just listen for a second, please!

859
00:51:09.545 --> 00:51:10.715
Turn that goddamned camera...

860
00:51:12.755 --> 00:51:15.215
- We've been trying to get to her all...
- Make our own way.

861
00:51:15.295 --> 00:51:17.885
- No, do you have a...
- I am not jeopardizing this operation,

862
00:51:17.965 --> 00:51:19.295
- or my men.
- I don't want your help.

863
00:51:19.375 --> 00:51:20.835
You are getting on that chopper now.

864
00:51:20.925 --> 00:51:22.295
I just need you to listen to me
for one second, sir.

865
00:51:22.375 --> 00:51:24.505
- You have no idea what's out there.
- I don't care what's out there.

866
00:51:24.585 --> 00:51:25.585
Listen to me. She's dying.

867
00:51:25.675 --> 00:51:26.835
There is nothing I can do
about that now.

868
00:51:26.925 --> 00:51:29.335
The girl that I love more than anything
is dying and it's my fault.

869
00:51:29.415 --> 00:51:32.135
She should have been with me tonight,
and I let her go and...

870
00:51:32.215 --> 00:51:34.175
And I get it, okay?
You have your hands full. I get that.

871
00:51:34.255 --> 00:51:37.135
I get that, but we're gonna go after her,
and if you wanna stop me,

872
00:51:37.215 --> 00:51:39.585
- then you're gonna have to shoot me.
- Hud.

873
00:51:40.375 --> 00:51:43.215
- I don't feel so good.
- Oh, shit.

874
00:51:43.295 --> 00:51:46.255
- Bite! We've got a bite!
- Marlena.

875
00:51:46.335 --> 00:51:47.505
- Hold on a second.
- Get her moving.

876
00:51:47.585 --> 00:51:48.675
Keep moving!

877
00:51:48.755 --> 00:51:50.885
Hey, Marlena, are you okay?
Hey, what are you guys doing?

878
00:51:50.965 --> 00:51:52.885
Hold on a second.
Where are you taking her?

879
00:51:52.965 --> 00:51:54.715
Hold on a second. Wait!
Oh my God, wait!

880
00:51:54.795 --> 00:51:56.835
- Marlena, stop! Just wait a second!
- Let me go.

881
00:51:56.925 --> 00:51:58.215
- Just wait a second. Please.
- Let me go.

882
00:51:58.295 --> 00:51:59.835
- Wait! Marlena!
- Get out of the way.

883
00:51:59.925 --> 00:52:01.675
Marlena! Hold on a second!

884
00:52:01.755 --> 00:52:04.095
- Just wait a... Let go of me! Stop it!
- No.

885
00:52:08.255 --> 00:52:11.295
God! Please, God!
Where are you taking Marlena?

886
00:52:11.375 --> 00:52:12.625
Wait a second.

887
00:52:20.095 --> 00:52:22.135
It's over. There is nothing you can do.

888
00:52:22.215 --> 00:52:26.375
There is nothing you can do
for her now. It is over. It's over.

889
00:52:27.835 --> 00:52:29.965
- Rogers, clear out of here.
- You sure?

890
00:52:30.045 --> 00:52:32.095
I'll get them to the choppers from here.

891
00:52:32.175 --> 00:52:34.755
- Let's move out.
- Oh, my God.

892
00:52:36.175 --> 00:52:37.625
What just happened?

893
00:52:39.625 --> 00:52:42.045
Let's go. I shouldn't be doing this shit.

894
00:52:42.135 --> 00:52:45.215
- Come on. Come on.
- Okay.

895
00:52:45.295 --> 00:52:47.375
- Let's go. Move.
- Okay, okay.

896
00:52:47.465 --> 00:52:48.885
Let's go, move. Come on.

897
00:52:53.135 --> 00:52:54.965
You gotta listen to me.

898
00:52:55.545 --> 00:52:58.215
This girl, her building,
it's at Columbus Circle?

899
00:52:58.295 --> 00:53:01.135
- Yeah?
- If you wanna go out in this,

900
00:53:01.215 --> 00:53:03.505
I ain't gonna stop you.
But you gotta know something.

901
00:53:03.585 --> 00:53:05.965
The government's considering
the Hammer Down protocol,

902
00:53:06.045 --> 00:53:07.925
which means they're willing
to let this whole area go.

903
00:53:08.005 --> 00:53:10.625
- You mean Midtown?
- No, I mean Manhattan.

904
00:53:10.715 --> 00:53:13.715
Come on. We're taking
one last shot at this thing.

905
00:53:13.795 --> 00:53:14.755
- Oh, God.
- If that doesn't work,

906
00:53:14.835 --> 00:53:17.585
they're leveling
the whole goddamned city.

907
00:53:18.465 --> 00:53:19.925
- Your watch is still working?
- Yeah?

908
00:53:20.005 --> 00:53:22.625
All right. The airlifts are leaving
from 40th and Park.

909
00:53:22.715 --> 00:53:25.415
Last chopper's wheels-up
at exactly 0600.

910
00:53:25.835 --> 00:53:28.295
If you can make it there,
then they'll get you out.

911
00:53:28.375 --> 00:53:31.095
- Okay. Okay, thank you.
- 58th Street's right there.

912
00:53:31.175 --> 00:53:32.965
- Now, go. Move, move, move.
- Let's go.

913
00:53:33.045 --> 00:53:34.375
- Let's go.
- Go, go, go.

914
00:53:37.335 --> 00:53:39.625
- This is like a nightmare, you know.
- It all happened so fast,

915
00:53:39.715 --> 00:53:41.675
I couldn't even really see
what happened to her.

916
00:53:42.255 --> 00:53:44.715
I mean, did you see it?
Could you see what happened, Hud?

917
00:53:44.795 --> 00:53:47.675
No, her eyes started bleeding, and then
they were screaming she was bitten.

918
00:53:47.755 --> 00:53:50.095
And then she wouldn't stop bleeding.
And then...

919
00:53:53.335 --> 00:53:54.715
Hud.

920
00:53:57.005 --> 00:54:01.255
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

921
00:54:05.045 --> 00:54:07.795
Look, guys, I don't mean to be...
But we don't have a lot of time.

922
00:54:07.885 --> 00:54:10.925
Okay, so maybe you guys
should just stay here, and I'll go.

923
00:54:11.005 --> 00:54:12.335
All right?

924
00:54:13.465 --> 00:54:17.005
- I'm sorry. I just...
- No, no, we're coming. We're coming.

925
00:54:17.095 --> 00:54:18.255
Are you sure?

926
00:54:18.335 --> 00:54:20.925
No, no, man.
No, we have to do this, okay?

927
00:54:21.005 --> 00:54:23.505
We're with you. Let's go.
Let's go. Let's go right now.

928
00:54:37.255 --> 00:54:39.335
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- What?

929
00:54:39.415 --> 00:54:41.885
- Oh, my God.
- What is it? What?

930
00:54:42.925 --> 00:54:45.715
- Shit.
- That's not Beth's place, is it?

931
00:54:45.795 --> 00:54:47.755
- Oh, my God.
- Is that Beth's apartment?

932
00:54:47.835 --> 00:54:51.255
- Oh, my God.
- Rob. Is that her place?

933
00:54:51.835 --> 00:54:54.585
- Tell me that's not her place.
- That's her place, yeah.

934
00:54:55.925 --> 00:54:59.625
Oh, shit. I don't suppose
she lives on the ground floor.

935
00:54:59.715 --> 00:55:00.885
No, 39th.

936
00:55:00.965 --> 00:55:02.675
- Oh, great.
- How do we even get up there?

937
00:55:02.755 --> 00:55:06.755
I don't know. We just go inside
and then see how high we can get.

938
00:55:08.585 --> 00:55:10.675
I don't know if I can do that.

939
00:55:10.795 --> 00:55:13.795
Well, maybe we could try going up
the other building,

940
00:55:13.885 --> 00:55:16.625
and then see if there's a place
to cross over onto her roof.

941
00:55:16.715 --> 00:55:19.925
And then we could find some way
down to her place.

942
00:55:21.505 --> 00:55:23.415
Wait. No, never mind.
No, that's a bad idea.

943
00:55:23.505 --> 00:55:25.045
Hey, that's a bad idea. I take that back.

944
00:55:25.135 --> 00:55:30.715
No one ever listens to me, ever.
And now, of course, they listen to me.

945
00:55:30.795 --> 00:55:31.795
Great.

946
00:55:34.545 --> 00:55:36.375
Shit. Shit.

947
00:55:37.175 --> 00:55:38.585
Probably not working.

948
00:55:38.675 --> 00:55:40.045
- What's going on?
- Not working.

949
00:55:40.135 --> 00:55:42.465
Wait, wait. Let's just... Maybe...

950
00:55:43.965 --> 00:55:45.545
- No? No?
- Shit.

951
00:55:45.625 --> 00:55:48.215
Well, why don't you take the stairs?

952
00:55:50.505 --> 00:55:53.585
You guys see that guy's face
when Lily asked him what it was?

953
00:55:53.675 --> 00:55:55.835
I mean, they have no idea.

954
00:55:57.675 --> 00:56:01.755
- Unless they're, like, in on it.
- Jesus, Hud.

955
00:56:01.835 --> 00:56:03.215
I don't read the papers.

956
00:56:03.295 --> 00:56:04.965
- Maybe our government made this thing.
- Oh, yeah.

957
00:56:05.045 --> 00:56:06.755
I mean, you know,
maybe it was an accident,

958
00:56:06.835 --> 00:56:08.175
- or maybe it was on purpose...
- Sure, maybe they did.

959
00:56:08.255 --> 00:56:10.135
- Does it really matter right now?
- Yeah.

960
00:56:11.215 --> 00:56:14.045
It matters because I need to talk
about something.

961
00:56:14.925 --> 00:56:17.835
Otherwise, I'm actually probably
going to shit my pants in this stairwell.

962
00:56:22.675 --> 00:56:23.675
I'm sorry.

963
00:56:26.175 --> 00:56:28.925
Hey, wait, wait. You guys hear that?
You guys hear that?

964
00:56:30.675 --> 00:56:31.715
- Yes.
- Yeah.

965
00:56:31.795 --> 00:56:34.255
Yeah, I think we're getting close.

966
00:56:35.545 --> 00:56:37.675
Hud, I'm gonna check this floor.

967
00:56:37.755 --> 00:56:38.755
Okay.

968
00:56:45.965 --> 00:56:48.965
Okay, like, I think it's like,
two more up, I think.

969
00:56:49.045 --> 00:56:50.045
Okay.

970
00:56:51.255 --> 00:56:52.545
Guys, guys, guys.

971
00:56:53.295 --> 00:56:55.755
This one, it's got to be.
It's got to be this one.

972
00:57:11.835 --> 00:57:12.885
Oh, God.

973
00:57:18.835 --> 00:57:22.415
I don't think there's anybody here. No.

974
00:57:24.625 --> 00:57:27.295
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh, my God.

975
00:57:30.135 --> 00:57:32.755
- Oh, my God.
- Okay.

976
00:57:33.135 --> 00:57:34.795
Okay, now, we can do this.
We can totally do this.

977
00:57:34.885 --> 00:57:36.375
- I don't know, Rob.
- Look, it's a straight shot.

978
00:57:36.465 --> 00:57:38.795
- I don't know. I'm sorry.
- Lily, Lily, it's a straight shot.

979
00:57:38.885 --> 00:57:41.045
Look, it's a straight shot.
We could use... There's pipes there.

980
00:57:41.135 --> 00:57:44.255
We could use
the air conditioners. Okay?

981
00:57:44.585 --> 00:57:46.835
Come on. We came this far.
We can do it. I'll go first.

982
00:57:46.925 --> 00:57:47.925
- Okay, okay, okay. Yes.
- All right? Okay.

983
00:57:48.005 --> 00:57:52.005
- Okay, I'll document it.
- Be careful, okay?

984
00:57:52.585 --> 00:57:56.175
- Come on. Come on.
- Okay. Okay.

985
00:57:59.465 --> 00:58:03.135
Okay. Hud, come on!
Put the camera down! Come on!

986
00:58:03.215 --> 00:58:04.715
Oh, Jesus.

987
00:58:04.795 --> 00:58:07.135
- Okay. All right. Okay.
- I'll go first.

988
00:58:07.215 --> 00:58:11.835
All right. If this is the last thing you see,
that means I died.

989
00:58:11.925 --> 00:58:13.465
- Hud, come on!
- Okay.

990
00:58:26.255 --> 00:58:28.045
Look out! Oh, shit...

991
00:58:29.415 --> 00:58:30.415
Okay.

992
00:58:32.885 --> 00:58:35.135
- Okay. Okay.
- Shit.

993
00:58:40.045 --> 00:58:42.135
- Okay. Okay.
- Oh, God.

994
00:58:54.755 --> 00:58:57.045
- Yes. Okay. You all right?
- Yeah.

995
00:58:57.135 --> 00:58:59.215
We're almost there, come on.

996
00:59:01.675 --> 00:59:03.135
Come on, Hud.

997
00:59:07.505 --> 00:59:08.045
Shit.

998
00:59:08.045 --> 00:59:08.505
Shit.

999
00:59:08.585 --> 00:59:13.215
Beth! Beth! Beth!

1000
00:59:22.965 --> 00:59:26.715
- Can you get it?
- Do you need help?

1001
00:59:27.675 --> 00:59:29.715
Do you need help? Or...

1002
00:59:36.335 --> 00:59:38.005
Beth? Beth?

1003
00:59:41.545 --> 00:59:42.585
Beth?

1004
00:59:45.045 --> 00:59:48.175
Beth? Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1005
00:59:48.255 --> 00:59:49.715
- What?
- Shit.

1006
00:59:50.255 --> 00:59:54.005
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Beth.

1007
00:59:58.045 --> 00:59:59.375
- Beth.
- What?

1008
00:59:59.465 --> 01:00:00.545
Beth!

1009
01:00:01.715 --> 01:00:03.755
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1010
01:00:11.625 --> 01:00:14.585
Can you hear me? Beth.

1011
01:00:31.925 --> 01:00:33.335
Hey.

1012
01:00:36.925 --> 01:00:39.925
- Are you really here?
- Yeah, I'm really here.

1013
01:00:41.755 --> 01:00:42.795
Rob?

1014
01:00:44.625 --> 01:00:46.755
You came back for me.

1015
01:00:47.675 --> 01:00:49.925
Of course I came back for you.

1016
01:00:51.795 --> 01:00:56.005
- I'm sorry it took me so long.
- No, it's okay.

1017
01:00:59.045 --> 01:01:02.545
Okay, okay, okay. You're okay.
We're gonna get you out of here, okay?

1018
01:01:02.625 --> 01:01:05.215
We'll get you out, all right?
Hud, put the camera down

1019
01:01:05.295 --> 01:01:07.135
- and help me, okay?
- Okay, okay.

1020
01:01:08.465 --> 01:01:09.585
- It'll be okay.
- Okay, here we go.

1021
01:01:09.675 --> 01:01:12.045
- If we all just lift at the same time.
- Hold on, okay. We got you.

1022
01:01:12.135 --> 01:01:13.885
- All right? We have to.
- Don't do that, Rob.

1023
01:01:13.965 --> 01:01:15.625
- Please don't do that.
- It's gonna be over in a second.

1024
01:01:15.715 --> 01:01:16.795
- All right?
- Okay. Ready, guys?

1025
01:01:16.885 --> 01:01:18.095
- No, please. No.
- Slowly. It's okay.

1026
01:01:18.175 --> 01:01:19.545
We're gonna do it real slow.

1027
01:01:19.625 --> 01:01:21.335
- Easy, easy, just wait.
- No, don't.

1028
01:01:21.415 --> 01:01:23.795
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

1029
01:01:27.465 --> 01:01:28.835
Oh, God.

1030
01:01:31.715 --> 01:01:35.625
- Okay, now, sit down. Sit down.

1031
01:01:35.715 --> 01:01:38.675
I know. I know. You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

1032
01:01:41.335 --> 01:01:43.095
- You're gonna be fine.
- No, no, no.

1033
01:01:43.175 --> 01:01:45.675
I know, I know, I know it hurts.
I know it hurts.

1034
01:01:48.675 --> 01:01:50.545
What is that?

1035
01:01:51.335 --> 01:01:52.625
- God.
- It's a terrible thing.

1036
01:01:52.715 --> 01:01:54.505
- Okay. We gotta go. We gotta go.
- Okay. Let's go.

1037

01:02:01.545 --> 01:02:03.835
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay, all right?

1041
01:02:03.925 --> 01:02:06.175
Just hold on to me.
You're gonna be all right.

1042
01:02:07.505 --> 01:02:09.965
You're gonna be okay, all right?
You're gonna be okay.

1043
01:02:14.215 --> 01:02:17.095
- Okay. Hang on to me.
- Oh, my God.

1044
01:02:17.175 --> 01:02:19.585
- Okay, okay.
- Oh, my God.

1045
01:02:21.415 --> 01:02:22.545
Okay.

1046
01:02:23.045 --> 01:02:26.335
Oh, shit. Man, this is unbelievable.

1047
01:02:28.255 --> 01:02:31.135
- Are you okay?
- Just don't look down, okay?

1048
01:02:31.215 --> 01:02:33.415
- I can't help it.
- You're all right. You're all right.

1049
01:02:33.505 --> 01:02:34.755
Oh, my God.

1050
01:02:38.675 --> 01:02:39.885
Oh, God!

1051
01:02:40.715 --> 01:02:42.375
- Okay, let's go.
- Keep moving, just go.

1052
01:02:42.465 --> 01:02:44.585
Go, just go. Just go, go, go. Go.
Just get to the other side.

1053
01:02:44.675 --> 01:02:46.715
Come on, just keep moving.

1054
01:02:49.045 --> 01:02:50.095
Oh, my God.

1055
01:02:52.585 --> 01:02:54.675
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, my God!

1056
01:02:54.755 --> 01:02:57.295
- Oh, my God. Did you see that?
- Okay, come on.

1057
01:02:57.375 --> 01:02:59.505
- Get inside.
- Okay. Come on, come on.

1058
01:02:59.585 --> 01:03:01.585
- Oh, God.
- Go! Go!

1059
01:03:08.255 --> 01:03:10.095
Run! Run! Hurry!

1060
01:03:12.545 --> 01:03:16.295
- Rob, come on!
- Oh, my God.

1061
01:03:30.795 --> 01:03:32.215
Oh, my God.

1062
01:03:33.135 --> 01:03:35.215
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know.

1063
01:03:35.295 --> 01:03:37.585
Something else also terrible.

1064
01:03:38.255 --> 01:03:39.795
Rob, what time
do the choppers take off?

1065
01:03:39.885 --> 01:03:41.715
- 0600.
- What time is that?

1066
01:03:41.795 --> 01:03:44.415
- 6:00, Hud.
- Yeah, okay. I knew that.

1067
01:03:47.885 --> 01:03:49.965
- Come on, come on.
- Okay.

1068
01:04:26.835 --> 01:04:27.835
Wait up!

1069
01:04:35.375 --> 01:04:37.795
- Did we make it?
- We want to get out of here, come on.

1070
01:04:39.135 --> 01:04:40.375
Let's go! Let's go!

1071
01:04:42.295 --> 01:04:43.625
Keep your heads down.

1072
01:04:43.715 --> 01:04:45.375
Come on! Come on!

1073
01:04:48.795 --> 01:04:49.885
You guys are on the next chopper.

1074
01:04:49.965 --> 01:04:51.755
- No!
- Clear this area. Clear this area.

1075
01:04:51.835 --> 01:04:54.675
- No, no, wait. Wait.
- Lily!

1076
01:04:55.505 --> 01:04:58.295
We'll be right behind you, okay?

1077
01:04:58.375 --> 01:05:02.295
Wait for us. Wait for us.
We'll be right behind you.

1078
01:05:05.545 --> 01:05:09.045
We're gonna be okay. All right?
We're gonna be all right, you hear me?

1079
01:05:16.925 --> 01:05:21.135
Oh, God! Jesus Christ!

1080
01:05:29.045 --> 01:05:31.255
Stay low. Stay low.
Come on, come on, come on.

1081
01:05:32.045 --> 01:05:33.045
Thank you.

1082
01:05:35.095 --> 01:05:38.795
- They're starting the bomb run.
- Get them out of here. Get going.

1083
01:05:48.925 --> 01:05:51.005
Oh, shit. Oh, my God.

1084
01:05:53.415 --> 01:05:56.045
Oh, my God.
Are you guys seeing this right now?

1085
01:05:56.135 --> 01:05:58.255
Are you seeing this right now?
Look, look, look.

1086
01:05:58.335 --> 01:06:03.925
Are you seeing this shit right now?
Oh, my God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

1087
01:06:09.755 --> 01:06:12.585
Oh, God.
Those aren't gonna hit us, are they?

1088
01:06:14.335 --> 01:06:16.505
Oh, my God. They hit it!
They just hit it right now!

1089
01:06:16.585 --> 01:06:20.135
Look, you guys, they just hit it!
They hit it with... Oh, my God!

1090
01:06:21.005 --> 01:06:23.755
- Yeah, they hit it, you guys! They hit it!
- Oh, he's going down.

1091
01:06:24.215 --> 01:06:26.925
Target down. Target down.
Target down. He's down.

1092
01:06:27.005 --> 01:06:28.835
I think they got him.

1093
01:06:28.925 --> 01:06:31.375
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
That's the shit right there!

1094
01:06:31.465 --> 01:06:35.335
That's what I'm talking about...
Oh, my God! Oh, no, no, no!

1095
01:06:38.135 --> 01:06:40.675
Oh, my God. Oh my God.
God, please, God.

1096
01:06:40.755 --> 01:06:43.835
Please, God. Please.
Please, God and Jesus.

1097
01:06:43.925 --> 01:06:45.545
Jesus Christ, I'm sorry.

1098
01:06:45.625 --> 01:06:48.215
I'm so sorry, God. Please, no.

1099
01:06:48.295 --> 01:06:50.175
Help me, Rob!

1100
01:06:50.255 --> 01:06:53.625
Rob. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1101
01:07:18.965 --> 01:07:21.835
This is Hawkeye 6. Target still active.

1102
01:07:21.925 --> 01:07:24.835
Initiating Hammer Down.
TOT, 15 minutes.

1103
01:07:25.175 --> 01:07:27.135
Sirens will sound two minutes out.

1104
01:07:27.215 --> 01:07:30.045
If you can hear those sirens,
you're in the blasting zone.

1105
01:07:32.885 --> 01:07:36.375
Come on. Come on. Hud.
Hud, are you okay?

1106
01:07:37.415 --> 01:07:41.095
- Yeah, all right. I guess. I think so.
- I can't move my arm.

1107
01:07:41.175 --> 01:07:43.505
- This is Duncan-Charlie, return to base.
- Help me, you got to help me.

1108
01:07:43.585 --> 01:07:45.465
- God help us.
- Okay. Okay, okay.

1109
01:07:45.545 --> 01:07:47.215
Come on, help me.

1110
01:07:50.755 --> 01:07:52.585
I know, I know. We're gonna
get you out of here. Come on.

1111
01:07:52.675 --> 01:07:53.885
Hud, come over to the other side.

1112
01:07:53.965 --> 01:07:55.755
You've got to pull him up.
Come on, come on.

1113
01:07:55.835 --> 01:07:57.885
- Okay, okay.
- I don't think I can move.

1114
01:07:57.965 --> 01:07:59.465
Yes, you can. Don't say that.

1115
01:07:59.545 --> 01:08:00.835
Copy your last, we're on the move.

1116
01:08:00.925 --> 01:08:02.625
- Here, take his hand. Take his hand.
- Good luck.

1117
01:08:02.715 --> 01:08:05.335
Hold on, I got it. I got it. I got it.
Come on, come on.

1118
01:08:09.375 --> 01:08:11.135
I got his legs, go!

1119
01:08:15.885 --> 01:08:19.465
- My leg!
- I know. I know, I know. I know.

1120
01:08:19.545 --> 01:08:21.885
It's okay, you're fine. You're good.
You're okay. You're okay.

1121
01:08:21.965 --> 01:08:23.415
I'm gonna have to stop the bleeding,
okay? Okay?

1122
01:08:23.505 --> 01:08:24.835
I'm not okay.
I'm not gonna be able to walk.

1123
01:08:24.925 --> 01:08:27.415
You are going to be able to walk.

1124
01:08:30.545 --> 01:08:31.925
Don't do it.

1125
01:08:33.675 --> 01:08:35.545
Okay. All right, listen,
we got to get out of here, okay?

1126
01:08:35.625 --> 01:08:36.795
Well, which way do we go?

1127
01:08:36.885 --> 01:08:39.005
We have to get away from here,
because I think it's gonna explode.

1128
01:08:39.095 --> 01:08:41.965
- Okay, okay. Okay.
- All right? Come on. Let's go.

1129
01:08:42.045 --> 01:08:44.505
Let's go this way. Come on.
Come on, you can walk. Okay.

1130
01:08:44.585 --> 01:08:46.835
Come on. Hold on, wait a second.

1131
01:08:46.925 --> 01:08:47.925
- Hud!
- Hud!

1132
01:08:48.005 --> 01:08:51.095
What? Oh! Oh, no!

1133
01:08:53.675 --> 01:08:55.215
- Hud! Hud!
- Hud, what are you doing?

1134
01:09:04.465 --> 01:09:05.585
Hud!

1135
01:09:25.545 --> 01:09:26.885
Hud!

1136
01:09:29.295 --> 01:09:30.375
Hud!

1137
01:09:32.585 --> 01:09:33.585
Hud!

1138
01:09:34.335 --> 01:09:36.885
Hud! Hud!

1139
01:09:37.755 --> 01:09:39.885
Hud! Hud!

1140
01:09:40.755 --> 01:09:42.545
Hud! Hud!

1141
01:09:43.675 --> 01:09:44.795
Hud!

1142
01:10:23.335 --> 01:10:24.795
He's gone.

1143
01:10:28.545 --> 01:10:30.045
He's gone.

1144
01:10:30.925 --> 01:10:33.295
- They're all gone.
- I know.

1145
01:10:38.925 --> 01:10:43.795
We gotta go. We gotta go.
We gotta get out of here.

1146
01:10:43.885 --> 01:10:46.965
Where? There's nowhere to go to.

1147
01:10:47.045 --> 01:10:49.295
We got to go. He's coming towards us.

1148
01:10:49.375 --> 01:10:52.465
No, we should just wait here.
Just wait here.

1149
01:10:52.545 --> 01:10:55.255
Listen, we wait here,
they'll find us, all right?

1150
01:10:55.335 --> 01:10:58.005
They're fighting him right now.
If we wait here, they'll find us.

1151
01:10:58.095 --> 01:11:00.215
No, we can't stay.

1152
01:11:03.885 --> 01:11:05.625
It's okay. It's okay.

1153
01:11:09.135 --> 01:11:12.925
- I'm so scared.
- I know. I know. I know.

1154
01:11:40.675 --> 01:11:42.835
My name is Robert Hawkins.

1155
01:11:42.925 --> 01:11:47.755
It's 6:42 a.m. On Saturday, May 23.

1156
01:11:48.415 --> 01:11:52.415
Approximately seven hours ago,
something attacked the city.

1157
01:11:53.415 --> 01:11:54.835
I don't know what it is.

1158
01:11:55.625 --> 01:11:58.175
If you found this tape... I mean,
if you're watching this right now,

1159
01:11:58.255 --> 01:12:01.135
then you probably know more
about it than I do.

1160
01:12:02.755 --> 01:12:07.005
Whatever it is,
it killed my brother, Jason Hawkins.

1161
01:12:07.095 --> 01:12:10.175
It killed my best friend, Hudson Platt,
and Marlena Diamond,

1162
01:12:10.255 --> 01:12:12.045
and many, many others.

1163
01:12:12.135 --> 01:12:15.585
We've crashed here in Central Park
and taken shelter under this bridge.

1164
01:12:15.675 --> 01:12:18.045
The military has begun
bombing the creature

1165
01:12:18.135 --> 01:12:20.215
and we're caught in the middle.

1166
01:12:21.675 --> 01:12:23.215
Okay. Ready?

1167
01:12:27.795 --> 01:12:29.215
It's okay.

1168
01:12:31.835 --> 01:12:34.255
- Beth, look at me.
- I don't know what to say.

1169
01:12:34.335 --> 01:12:36.885
Well, just tell them who you are.

1170
01:12:39.175 --> 01:12:44.715
My name is Elizabeth Mclntyre.
I don't know why this is happening.

1171
01:12:48.005 --> 01:12:50.415
But we're gonna wait here
until this passes.

1172
01:12:53.715 --> 01:12:55.885
Rob, we're gonna wait here.

1173
01:13:04.925 --> 01:13:07.335
Look at me, Beth.
Look at me. Look at me.

1174
01:13:07.415 --> 01:13:09.795
- I love you.
- I love you.

1175
01:13:14.375 --> 01:13:17.175
I know what I'm talking about.
Come on, admit it.

1176
01:13:17.255 --> 01:13:18.965
You are going to miss me
a little bit, right?

1177
01:13:19.045 --> 01:13:21.505
Yeah, we'll see.

1178
01:13:21.965 --> 01:13:23.375
Okay, yeah, all right.

1179
01:13:23.465 --> 01:13:25.835
All right, we're almost out of tape.
We got, like, three seconds left.

1180
01:13:25.925 --> 01:13:27.095
What do you wanna say?
What do you wanna say?

1181
01:13:27.175 --> 01:13:28.335
Last thing to the camera.

1182
01:13:29.545 --> 01:13:31.375
I had a good day.

1183
