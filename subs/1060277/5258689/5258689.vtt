1
00:01:47.357 --> 00:01:49.525
It's 6:42 a.m.

2
00:01:53.363 --> 00:01:55.051
Beth's Dad's place.

3
00:01:59.169 --> 00:02:00.386
He's out of town.

4
00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:07.740
And it's already a good day.

5
00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:40.910
Beth.

6
00:02:44.665 --> 00:02:46.624
Rob, what are you doing?
Nothing.

7
00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:48.078
Well, then stop.
Nothing.

8
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.468
That's.
Stop it.

9
00:02:50.504 --> 00:02:51.879
She's shy.

10
00:02:52.287 --> 00:02:54.914
I could just see this ending up
on the Internet.

11
00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:57.371
Well, fine, cover up.
See if I care.

12
00:02:58.011 --> 00:02:59.511
I'm interested in other things.

13
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.208
Like what?

14
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.019
Like you.

15
00:03:10.941 --> 00:03:12.753
Oh, man.
That was close.

16
00:03:14.207 --> 00:03:16.750
Do it reall, I'm scared of it.

17
00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:18.808
It's only 30 minutes out.
Shut up. I've never been.

18
00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:20.250
You've never been to Coney Island?

19
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.367
How have you never been
to Coney Island?

20
00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:24.078
I don't know, I just…
I've never been.

21
00:03:24.162 --> 00:03:26.038
Oh, that's… It's so much fun.
I'm taking you. We're going.

22
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.455
Oh, my God.
You're so excited about this.

23
00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:28.583
Yeah, I can't wait to…
Give me this.

24
00:03:28.585 --> 00:03:29.941
What are you doing?
What?

25
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.808
Ok then from the neck up, ok?
That's the only way I consent to this.

26
00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.581
Oh please Rob,
nobody's paying for that online.

27
00:03:35.036 --> 00:03:36.966
You've never been to
Twelve-Chest-Hairs.com, have you?

28
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.682
Ok.

29
00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:39.971
Ok. What else?
What else, what?

30
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.241
Other than cotton candy
and Tilt-A-Whirls?

31
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.703
What do you want to do today?

32
00:03:45.805 --> 00:03:46.837
If I answer that…

33
00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:48.895
Alright, is this thing on?
Look out!

34
00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:50.021
Babe, it's not my camera.

35
00:03:50.023 --> 00:03:51.690
I don't know if it's the on button
or the zoom button.

36
00:03:51.756 --> 00:03:53.482
Alright. Here, here, here.
I think I got it. Is this on?

37
00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:56.094
Oh, perfect. Now we can have
a nice record of you getting run over.

38
00:03:56.278 --> 00:03:57.361
Is that funny?

39
00:03:58.906 --> 00:04:01.215
What time is everybody starting to show up?
It's getting late here.

40
00:04:01.216 --> 00:04:02.671
A couple hours.
That's why we have to hurry.

41
00:04:03.412 --> 00:04:04.644
Where are we going?

42
00:04:04.646 --> 00:04:06.952
We're going, we're just going
around the corner to the store!

43
00:04:08.582 --> 00:04:11.740
I want you to go around with your brother's
camera and get testimonials from everyone.

44
00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:14.069
Why? It's, it's not a wedding.

45
00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:16.907
I know it's not a wedding.
I said like a wedding.

46
00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:19.151
I can't get this.

47
00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:21.989
I don't get, I don't understand
why I have to do it.

48
00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:24.555
Because, I mean, I don't…
I don't even know how to work this…

49
00:04:24.848 --> 00:04:27.183
That's what I think is gonna happen.
No, I'm not!

50
00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:28.603
You totally are. You…
No you have no clue!

51
00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:30.437
Ok, well, let me ask you a question.

52
00:04:30.512 --> 00:04:32.047
Can you see me through
the viewfinder?

53
00:04:33.231 --> 00:04:34.640
Yeah. Got you.

54
00:04:34.851 --> 00:04:37.488
Good. Now can you see me trying
to carry these bags all by myself?

55
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:38.882
You're doing a great job.

56
00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:40.789
Here, practice doing two things at once.

57
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.366
That's good! That was good.
Thank you.

58
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.542
I'm not lugging this thing around all night long.
He is your brother.

59
00:04:45.544 --> 00:04:47.079
This is important. Stop freaking out.
I understand that Lily,

60
00:04:47.098 --> 00:04:48.472
but it's a shit job!
No, it isn't.

61
00:04:48.474 --> 00:04:49.792
Yes, it is! I'm not doing it!

62
00:04:49.794 --> 00:04:52.004
Jason, I have been planning this
for two weeks!

63
00:04:52.006 --> 00:04:53.735
All I want you to do is help me.
Ok, babe, babe.

64
00:04:53.737 --> 00:04:56.264
Ok. Alright?
I'll. I'll do it. It's fine.

65
00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:59.028
I really pissed her off.

66
00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:01.433
Babe, come on.

67
00:05:01.902 --> 00:05:03.591
I was just kidding! Come on!

68
00:05:03.887 --> 00:05:04.651
Hud?

69
00:05:05.564 --> 00:05:07.317
Hud, listen to me.
I got a job for you.

70
00:05:08.058 --> 00:05:09.183
I already have got a job.

71
00:05:09.267 --> 00:05:10.434
I'm doing the sign, so…
Yeah, no. I see that,

72
00:05:10.456 --> 00:05:11.912
but this is more important than the sign.

73
00:05:12.549 --> 00:05:15.682
You know how, like at weddings, people
give testimonials to the camera, right?

74
00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:17.046
No.

75
00:05:17.562 --> 00:05:18.208
Alright.

76
00:05:18.402 --> 00:05:20.550
You're gonna take the camera
and just you know,

77
00:05:20.576 --> 00:05:23.322
go around the party and film people
wishing Rob good luck.

78
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:24.531
I don't know, man.

79
00:05:24.533 --> 00:05:25.866
That's a lot of responsibility.
This is important.

80
00:05:25.868 --> 00:05:26.993
And then you have
to do it the whole night…

81
00:05:26.995 --> 00:05:28.150
And Marlena's gonna be here.

82
00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.102
She is?
Oh, yeah. She is.

83
00:05:30.104 --> 00:05:31.472
So you're gonna take that.
Oh, hold on.

84
00:05:31.474 --> 00:05:32.897
And you're gonna talk to her…
I didn't…

85
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.709
For Rob.
I didn't say I would do it.

86
00:05:34.793 --> 00:05:35.918
Just try it out.
Alright, I'll do a few.

87
00:05:36.003 --> 00:05:37.657
You can, just do mine…

88
00:05:38.142 --> 00:05:39.267
Are you ready?
Yeah, go.

89
00:05:39.269 --> 00:05:39.850
Alright.

90
00:05:41.876 --> 00:05:43.887
Rob, I don't even know what to say, bro.

91
00:05:44.096 --> 00:05:46.088
Best of luck in Japan,
I love you so much.

92
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.681
And, I'm proud of you.

93
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.434
That's it.
That's it?

94
00:05:52.436 --> 00:05:53.682
Yeah. Easy enough.

95
00:05:53.684 --> 00:05:54.584
Yeah.

96
00:05:55.312 --> 00:05:56.700
It's actually kind of fun.

97
00:05:57.941 --> 00:05:59.094
You enjoy it, Hud.

98
00:05:59.096 --> 00:05:59.985
Thanks, man.

99
00:06:00.164 --> 00:06:01.823
Yeah, I'm doing…

100
00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:03.696
Hey, what's up, man?

101
00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.508
Hey, guys?
Hey?

102
00:06:06.616 --> 00:06:07.616
What do we say?
Anything.

103
00:06:07.743 --> 00:06:08.666
Bon voyage, Rob.

104
00:06:08.668 --> 00:06:10.521
Or however you say that in Japanese.

105
00:06:11.145 --> 00:06:12.455
An zen na...
An zen na?

106
00:06:12.456 --> 00:06:13.176
Yeah, good.

107
00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:15.118
Oh, yeah, alright.

108
00:06:15.173 --> 00:06:16.226
Oh, yeah…
Hud, what are you doing?

109
00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:17.878
I'm documenting the night.

110
00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.371
But I thought I asked Jason to do that.

111
00:06:20.363 --> 00:06:22.254
Yeah, well, Jason asked me to do it,

112
00:06:22.256 --> 00:06:23.276
so I've been doing it.

113
00:06:23.278 --> 00:06:24.380
I've been doing it really well.

114
00:06:24.415 --> 00:06:25.801
Well, are you gonna take it
seriously, though?

115
00:06:25.803 --> 00:06:27.335
Because it's really important.

116
00:06:27.337 --> 00:06:29.768
No, of course.
I've been taking it really, really seriously.

117
00:06:29.847 --> 00:06:30.847
Very seriously.
You promise?

118
00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:32.689
Yeah, you wanna
do your testimonial now?

119
00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:35.269
Ok.
Yeah, do it right now.

120
00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:35.862
Ok.

121
00:06:36.253 --> 00:06:38.176
Ok, just open up to him,
because this is gonna be

122
00:06:38.178 --> 00:06:40.100
the last thing he sees you…
ok, Hud, I got it.

123
00:06:40.358 --> 00:06:41.507
Robert Hawkins,

124
00:06:42.224 --> 00:06:45.434
I can't believe you're leaving me
to look after your brother by myself.

125
00:06:45.901 --> 00:06:49.146
Easy, easy.
I mean I'm obviously standing right here…

126
00:06:49.618 --> 00:06:51.368
And I know we're not officially family,

127
00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:52.494
yet, but…

128
00:06:52.496 --> 00:06:54.205
Not fair, because I'm gonna…
Dude.

129
00:06:54.229 --> 00:06:55.841
Ok.
I'll cut him out later.

130
00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:58.458
But I think of you as my brother,

131
00:06:59.163 --> 00:07:01.180
and I hope you think of me as a sister.

132
00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:04.222
So, you better call us.

133
00:07:05.008 --> 00:07:07.389
Now that you have this job,
you can afford to call us, so…

134
00:07:08.845 --> 00:07:09.755
Hud?

135
00:07:09.757 --> 00:07:10.596
Yeah.

136
00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:12.556
Yeah, sorry. No, you're good.
You're good. You're good.

137
00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:13.532
That was good!
That's it?

138
00:07:13.534 --> 00:07:15.140
I thought that was really, really good.
Give me...

139
00:07:15.621 --> 00:07:17.314
Yeah, but you weren't even paying
attention for…

140
00:07:26.655 --> 00:07:29.865
Ok. Ok, you can do this.

141
00:07:31.493 --> 00:07:33.971
Yeah. You got this, man.

142
00:07:34.246 --> 00:07:35.603
You got this.

143
00:07:40.544 --> 00:07:42.192
What's up, man?
Hey, what's up, dude?

144
00:07:43.088 --> 00:07:44.213
What's up?

145
00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:49.305
Excuse me!

146
00:07:49.307 --> 00:07:50.868
Hey, Marlena?

147
00:07:51.319 --> 00:07:53.278
Hey, what's up?
Hi. Hi.

148
00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.027
Hey, did you know that I'm going
around the party and I'm thinking…

149
00:07:56.168 --> 00:07:57.524
Do you know Rob's leaving?

150
00:07:57.727 --> 00:07:59.676
Like it's his going-away party.
Yeah. Yeah.

151
00:08:00.063 --> 00:08:00.938
Cool.

152
00:08:01.018 --> 00:08:01.544
Hey?

153
00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.852
So we're taping,

154
00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:05.503
I think people talking about him.

155
00:08:05.505 --> 00:08:06.768
Oh, no, thank you.

156
00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:08.258
I barely even know Rob.

157
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.779
I'm just coming to say hi to Lily,
so it's a little weird,

158
00:08:10.781 --> 00:08:12.364
if I'm even on it, I think, but thanks.

159
00:08:12.366 --> 00:08:14.991
Ok cool, except I'm supposed
to get everybody.

160
00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:16.002
So...

161
00:08:16.355 --> 00:08:17.886
have you ever been to a wedding?

162
00:08:17.973 --> 00:08:20.048
Yeah. No, I get what you're doing.
I just…

163
00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:21.472
I don't want to do it, but thank you.

164
00:08:21.527 --> 00:08:22.492
Ok, cool.

165
00:08:22.494 --> 00:08:24.632
We'll just do a short one real quick.

166
00:08:30.776 --> 00:08:31.524
Ok.

167
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:34.195
Hey Rob,

168
00:08:34.957 --> 00:08:35.916
Marlena.

169
00:08:36.391 --> 00:08:39.739
I think we've met like,
probably three times before, total,

170
00:08:39.857 --> 00:08:40.431
and...

171
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.985
every one of those times
I was really drunk,

172
00:08:43.048 --> 00:08:46.009
so I don't really even know what to say.

173
00:08:46.038 --> 00:08:47.914
But you have a cool job!
That's something!

174
00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:50.180
Like you're president of something!
Vice president!

175
00:08:50.447 --> 00:08:51.864
Also really cool.

176
00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:55.034
So good luck with that
and we're gonna be here

177
00:08:55.118 --> 00:08:58.398
keeping New York really safe
and fun for you when you come back.

178
00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.414
Cool, that was a really good one.
Yeah?

179
00:09:00.498 --> 00:09:02.166
Yeah, we can do another one
if you want.

180
00:09:03.126 --> 00:09:05.149
Do you actually have,
like a card or something?

181
00:09:05.151 --> 00:09:07.059
Well, my agency we're leaving.

182
00:09:07.061 --> 00:09:09.586
We're going on this stupid retreat
and they like all this video,

183
00:09:09.588 --> 00:09:10.731
like bonding crap.
Oh, yeah.

184
00:09:10.733 --> 00:09:12.268
I'm actually, I'm not a professional.

185
00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:12.940
What?

186
00:09:12.972 --> 00:09:14.197
I'm not a professional.

187
00:09:14.199 --> 00:09:15.558
I'm Hud.
Hug?

188
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:16.984
No, no, no, Hud.

189
00:09:16.986 --> 00:09:19.013
I'm Rob and Lily's friend.

190
00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:21.342
We met, like several times before.

191
00:09:21.426 --> 00:09:22.644
Oh, yeah, yeah.

192
00:09:22.646 --> 00:09:24.798
Yeah, you have the camera
in front of your face,

193
00:09:24.829 --> 00:09:26.553
it's probably why I didn't…
Ok, here. If I move it?

194
00:09:26.555 --> 00:09:28.681
Oh, yeah. What's going on? Totally.
Yeah.

195
00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.706
Yeah, cool. It's nice to see you again.

196
00:09:30.708 --> 00:09:31.884
Really good to see you.

197
00:09:31.886 --> 00:09:33.161
Really good.
So...

198
00:09:33.327 --> 00:09:34.867
What have you been up to?

199
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:35.845
I actually…

200
00:09:35.847 --> 00:09:38.400
I'm gonna just go grab some
food, but good luck with the…

201
00:09:38.518 --> 00:09:41.453
I could still do your agency's
retreat if you wanted…

202
00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:43.999
He's coming up the stairs right now.
Everybody get ready. Get ready.

203
00:09:44.062 --> 00:09:45.672
Can someone turn down
the music, please?

204
00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:53.393
Surprise! Surprise!

205
00:09:56.805 --> 00:09:58.514
No, no, no, no, no, no!

206
00:10:00.642 --> 00:10:02.436
How did you guys plan all this?

207
00:10:02.476 --> 00:10:04.387
Easy, you're naive.
Let's go.

208
00:10:04.896 --> 00:10:06.480
Hey. How are you?
Take this. Take this.

209
00:10:06.564 --> 00:10:08.631
I'm sorry. Yes. Thank you.
What's up?

210
00:10:08.715 --> 00:10:10.450
Oh, hey. Yes. Good.

211
00:10:10.816 --> 00:10:12.108
What's up, man?
Speech!

212
00:10:12.404 --> 00:10:15.531
Speech! Speech!
Speech! Speech!

213
00:10:18.926 --> 00:10:21.142
Oh, this is very surprising.
I hope so.

214
00:10:21.413 --> 00:10:23.080
Obviously.
It's a surprise party.

215
00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:23.983
Yeah.

216
00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:26.758
But it's very sweet.
So thank you.

217
00:10:27.617 --> 00:10:28.652
Lily?

218
00:10:28.712 --> 00:10:29.965
It was everyone. It was everyone.

219
00:10:29.967 --> 00:10:32.432
No, thank you, everyone.
Thank you. It's…

220
00:10:33.383 --> 00:10:34.556
Oh, it means a lot, so…

221
00:10:35.539 --> 00:10:36.714
That's it. So again.

222
00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:39.692
Have a good time!
Yeah, party!

223
00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:42.467
Hey, man.

224
00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.064
Were you surprised?

225
00:10:45.004 --> 00:10:46.936
I was like, not even surprised.

226
00:10:46.938 --> 00:10:48.832
No? Can you describe your current
emotions right now?

227
00:10:48.834 --> 00:10:51.345
I don't know, I would say blase.
Like, I'm a little…

228
00:10:51.456 --> 00:10:52.489
I'm just a little bored.

229
00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:56.093
No, you're not. Well, congrats.
No, man, that was awesome, dude.

230
00:10:56.095 --> 00:10:57.263
What are you doing with the video

231
00:10:57.265 --> 00:10:58.651
camera by the way?
I'm documenting the night

232
00:10:58.653 --> 00:11:00.239
so that you can take it
to Japan with you.

233
00:11:00.327 --> 00:11:01.522
Oh, can I watch it every night

234
00:11:01.524 --> 00:11:02.566
when I get there?
Jason asked if I…

235
00:11:02.568 --> 00:11:03.694
Yeah, you could.
Oh, good.

236
00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:06.242
Alright, thank you.
Cool.

237
00:11:07.417 --> 00:11:09.616
Hey, Hud, do you know
if Beth's coming tonight?

238
00:11:10.128 --> 00:11:12.103
Yeah, I guess. I'm
sure Lily invited her.

239
00:11:12.105 --> 00:11:13.440
Why would not she be here?

240
00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:29.467
So how are you gonna
survive without Rob?

241
00:11:29.469 --> 00:11:31.167
He's like your main dude.
Yeah, I know.

242
00:11:31.274 --> 00:11:32.947
Hey, how am I gonna
survive without you?

243
00:11:32.949 --> 00:11:34.806
I don't know. I'm like your main dude.

244
00:11:34.808 --> 00:11:35.727
Straight up.

245
00:11:37.655 --> 00:11:40.121
As I make my… I'm not here.

246
00:11:40.123 --> 00:11:41.159
Hi, Hud.

247
00:11:41.161 --> 00:11:43.088
I'm just documenting. Not here.

248
00:11:43.453 --> 00:11:45.079
That was my biggest problem
is that she picked him…

249
00:11:45.163 --> 00:11:47.873
You know what.
No, but when he said My Fair Lady…

250
00:11:47.875 --> 00:11:50.193
I love My Fair Lady.
I was like, Really?

251
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.802
That was wonderful.
But, I mean, it worked out, right?

252
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:55.484
Beth, hey!

253
00:11:56.196 --> 00:11:57.632
You made it.

254
00:11:57.634 --> 00:11:59.259
It doesn't matter dude, you're here.
All is well.

255
00:11:59.344 --> 00:12:00.313
Oh, no, it's good.
It's good.

256
00:12:00.512 --> 00:12:03.330
Enjoy it. Have fun.
Oh, I will. I'm just gonna go sa

257
00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:06.705
Who is that guy?
I don't know. He's random.

258
00:12:06.707 --> 00:12:09.251
Here, I'm gonna go check it out.
Look out, documenting.

259
00:12:09.312 --> 00:12:10.437
Oh, thanks.

260
00:12:10.522 --> 00:12:11.752
I missed your surprise.

261
00:12:11.754 --> 00:12:13.037
Oh, that's ok.
I'm sorry.

262
00:12:13.039 --> 00:12:14.778
No, we had cab problems.
I'm really sorry.

263
00:12:14.986 --> 00:12:16.570
That's fine.
Decorating's mine.

264
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:19.797
No, that's fantastic.
Rob, this is Travis.

265
00:12:19.823 --> 00:12:21.100
Hi.
Hi. Oh, pleasure.

266
00:12:21.102 --> 00:12:22.286
I've heard a lot about you.

267
00:12:22.492 --> 00:12:24.199
Congratulations, by the way.
Thank you.

268
00:12:24.201 --> 00:12:25.660
Vice President. That's fantastic.
I love your dress.

269
00:12:25.662 --> 00:12:27.234
Thank you. I love yours.
Yeah, thank you.

270
00:12:27.236 --> 00:12:28.524
That's really amazing.

271
00:12:28.832 --> 00:12:29.957
Should we…
Yeah, there is a buffet.

272
00:12:29.963 --> 00:12:31.881
Hey, I'm documenting the night.
I'm Hud.

273
00:12:32.043 --> 00:12:33.522
Ok.
So, there is tons of sake.

274
00:12:33.524 --> 00:12:35.170
Yeah, just help yourselves, enjoy.

275
00:12:35.255 --> 00:12:36.588
Enjoy, everybody.
It's good to meet you.

276
00:12:36.673 --> 00:12:39.069
Have a good one, yeah.
Thanks for coming.

277
00:12:40.677 --> 00:12:42.136
I think he just said I was cute.
Are they dating?

278
00:12:42.138 --> 00:12:42.925
Yeah.

279
00:13:04.534 --> 00:13:05.997
Hey, is everything cool, man?

280
00:13:06.161 --> 00:13:07.203
Yeah, everything's cool.

281
00:13:07.328 --> 00:13:08.738
Ok, because…

282
00:13:09.096 --> 00:13:10.705
I don't know, because
you been over here kind of…

283
00:13:10.707 --> 00:13:12.339
Is that my camera?

284
00:13:12.876 --> 00:13:14.293
I don't know.
Your brother gave it to me.

285
00:13:14.377 --> 00:13:16.628
Did you switch the tape?
Because I had a tape in there.

286
00:13:16.713 --> 00:13:17.754
I don't know.
Was…

287
00:13:18.047 --> 00:13:20.424
Roller-coasters are fun, but like,
any kind of tea-cuppy thing…

288
00:13:20.426 --> 00:13:23.470
Tape was in here when I got it.
Why?

289
00:13:25.847 --> 00:13:27.294
Rob, why?
No, it doesn't matter.

290
00:13:27.296 --> 00:13:28.890
It doesn't… It's stupid.

291
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:31.710
Ok, are you sure you're cool?
Because you're really weirding me out.

292
00:13:31.712 --> 00:13:33.317
Like, we haven't been hanging out
or anything.

293
00:13:35.398 --> 00:13:38.255
Here. Here, man. Come on.
Alright, cool. That's more like it.

294
00:13:39.235 --> 00:13:40.915
Excuse me. Sorry.

295
00:13:40.917 --> 00:13:41.738
Excuse me.

296
00:13:43.072 --> 00:13:45.032
Hey, Beth! Beth. Beth. Beth.
What's wrong with you?

297
00:13:45.116 --> 00:13:48.734
Hey, I'm filming goodbyes for Rob.
Do you want to say something?

298
00:13:49.491 --> 00:13:51.474
Hud, I don't know.

299
00:13:51.476 --> 00:13:53.555
It's not a really good time right now.

300
00:13:53.917 --> 00:13:55.000
Come on, he's leaving.

301
00:13:55.084 --> 00:13:56.376
I mean, can we…
I know.

302
00:13:56.461 --> 00:13:57.794
You're not gonna be able
to talk to him for a while.

303
00:13:57.796 --> 00:13:59.115
Isn't there something you wanna say?

304
00:14:03.092 --> 00:14:04.927
You know what?
Travis, can you get me a drink?

305
00:14:05.053 --> 00:14:06.887
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, of course.
Is that… ok.

306
00:14:06.889 --> 00:14:08.473
Cool, thanks.

307
00:14:09.307 --> 00:14:09.920
Ok.

308
00:14:10.492 --> 00:14:11.893
Let's… Right here? I don't…

309
00:14:11.976 --> 00:14:13.519
No, we can do it in the kitchen.
Ok, perfect.

310
00:14:13.603 --> 00:14:14.237
Ok.

311
00:14:16.614 --> 00:14:17.185
Ok.

312
00:14:19.827 --> 00:14:20.711
Rob,

313
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:25.578
I didn't want to do this on camera.

314
00:14:26.741 --> 00:14:27.539
But...

315
00:14:28.345 --> 00:14:29.093
I just…

316
00:14:29.828 --> 00:14:32.541
I just want you to know
how happy I am for you,

317
00:14:33.182 --> 00:14:35.991
because I know how hard
you've worked for this job and...

318
00:14:36.501 --> 00:14:38.225
I know how much it means to you and…

319
00:14:41.464 --> 00:14:43.087
And I'm really gonna miss you.

320
00:14:44.081 --> 00:14:46.969
Hey. Can I talk to you for a second?

321
00:14:53.184 --> 00:14:56.173
Jason? There's something totally weird
going on with Rob and Beth.

322
00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:59.425
What are you talking about?
I'm serious. They're right outside.

323
00:14:59.427 --> 00:15:00.461
Hud! Not now.

324
00:15:00.846 --> 00:15:02.479
Ok. I'll check it out.

325
00:15:02.777 --> 00:15:04.088
You never even called me, Rob!

326
00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:05.738
You go and bring some guy to my party?

327
00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:07.440
Hold on!
You haven't talked to me in weeks!

328
00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:09.896
Hud, man! Come on!
Sorry!

329
00:15:09.898 --> 00:15:12.191
What? What?
I got it. I got it. Hud, get back inside.

330
00:15:12.287 --> 00:15:13.517
But I'm documenting!

331
00:15:13.865 --> 00:15:14.946
Not this.

332
00:15:15.206 --> 00:15:16.970
Lily, do you know what
they were fighting about?

333
00:15:18.001 --> 00:15:19.735
Lily, if you know, you have to tell me.

334
00:15:19.737 --> 00:15:20.953
Lily!
I'm not telling you.

335
00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:22.126
I really should know,

336
00:15:22.434 --> 00:15:23.756
as the guy documenting this.

337
00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.061
She was the one
who brought me back inside.

338
00:15:25.063 --> 00:15:27.344
Ok, fine. We'll go find out.
I'm positive. I promise.

339
00:15:27.346 --> 00:15:28.619
We'll ask her. We'll go find out.
Actually she's in the kitchen.

340
00:15:28.982 --> 00:15:29.649
What?

341
00:15:30.376 --> 00:15:31.060
Lil!

342
00:15:31.709 --> 00:15:33.210
Lil, do you have something to tell us?

343
00:15:33.459 --> 00:15:34.581
No.
You do, don't you?

344
00:15:34.599 --> 00:15:35.726
What? No.
Hud, you're a genius.

345
00:15:35.728 --> 00:15:37.963
You're dodging the question right now.
There is nothing to tell you.

346
00:15:38.144 --> 00:15:39.097
Nothing.
Lily. Liar.

347
00:15:39.099 --> 00:15:40.321
If you know something
you have to tell us.

348
00:15:40.866 --> 00:15:41.791
No.
Look at me.

349
00:15:41.793 --> 00:15:43.590
Lily.
I know you. Babe.

350
00:15:45.653 --> 00:15:47.570
Ok, fine, but not on camera.
I'm not telling you on camera.

351
00:15:47.572 --> 00:15:49.071
Ok, that's not a problem.
Alright, no problem.

352
00:15:49.073 --> 00:15:50.490
Why would we say anything?

353
00:15:50.575 --> 00:15:52.075
We won't say anything.
Rob and Beth slept together.

354
00:15:52.283 --> 00:15:53.909
Are you serious?
It happened a few weeks ago.

355
00:15:53.911 --> 00:15:55.412
Beth made me promise
not to say anything.

356
00:15:55.414 --> 00:15:56.704
Are you kidding me, Lily?

357
00:15:56.706 --> 00:15:58.372
Rob and Beth sleep together,
you're not gonna tell me that?

358
00:15:58.374 --> 00:15:59.359
Why would not you tell me?

359
00:15:59.934 --> 00:16:01.127
Why would not I tell you?

360
00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:03.739
Ok, you guys, don't ask me
where I heard this.

361
00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:06.399
Rob and Beth totally had sex together.

362
00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:08.611
I knew it.
Are you kidding me?

363
00:16:08.613 --> 00:16:10.614
No, I'm not kidding.
This is extremely serious.

364
00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:12.134
Hey, Marlena.

365
00:16:12.388 --> 00:16:13.963
It's me, Hud from before.
Hi. Right.

366
00:16:13.965 --> 00:16:15.698
Did you know that Rob
and Beth had sex?

367
00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:18.303
No.
Yeah, isn't that crazy?

368
00:16:18.305 --> 00:16:19.347
They've been friends forever.
Crazy.

369
00:16:19.395 --> 00:16:21.185
I mean, Rob's been in love
with her since college.

370
00:16:21.457 --> 00:16:24.721
Well, maybe it was like
a going-away present, you know?

371
00:16:24.986 --> 00:16:27.865
Yeah. Wait, were we supposed
to get presents?

372
00:16:28.571 --> 00:16:29.978
They did. They had sexual intercourse.
What?

373
00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:31.031
Lily told me.
No way.

374
00:16:31.115 --> 00:16:32.199
No, you are so…
No, I promise.

375
00:16:32.283 --> 00:16:33.424
Why do you make up stuff like that?

376
00:16:33.451 --> 00:16:34.777
No, I do not. I have a nice car.
You make shit up.

377
00:16:34.786 --> 00:16:36.177
I didn't say what kind…

378
00:16:36.788 --> 00:16:37.954
Hey.

379
00:16:46.251 --> 00:16:47.773
Good luck in Japan, Rob.

380
00:16:48.822 --> 00:16:50.495
Good luck tonight, Travis.

381
00:16:54.263 --> 00:16:56.389
Hey, dude. Dude, dude, dude.
Are you alright, man?

382
00:16:56.391 --> 00:16:58.141
Hey. Come on.
This is not the time, Hud.

383
00:16:58.212 --> 00:16:59.578
What is it, man?
Let him go.

384
00:16:59.602 --> 00:17:01.186
We should talk to him.
We're not talking to him.

385
00:17:01.479 --> 00:17:02.688
I could talk to him now.

386
00:17:02.772 --> 00:17:04.287
Dude, you already talked
to the whole party!

387
00:17:04.482 --> 00:17:06.858
Have to do something.
No. Everyone needs to just calm down

388
00:17:06.943 --> 00:17:08.068
and give him space.
He's just gonna stay

389
00:17:08.152 --> 00:17:09.861
locked in his room all night?
Lily, look at you.

390
00:17:09.946 --> 00:17:11.776
It's fine, trust me.
It is not fine.

391
00:17:11.781 --> 00:17:13.365
It is fine.
You are his brother.

392
00:17:13.449 --> 00:17:15.743
You are his best friend.
Go and make him happy.

393
00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:18.268
So, how do you wanna do this?

394
00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:19.578
Do you wanna do
most of the talking,

395
00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:20.997
or do you want me
to do most of the talking?

396
00:17:21.124 --> 00:17:23.041
You're not doing any talking.
Ok, cool.

397
00:17:23.126 --> 00:17:24.209
We got to talk.

398
00:17:24.293 --> 00:17:25.335
You don't know
what you're talking about?

399
00:17:25.337 --> 00:17:26.556
Ok, well, then tell me.
Alright.

400
00:17:27.672 --> 00:17:29.546
It was just a spur of the moment thing.

401
00:17:30.007 --> 00:17:32.396
Yeah, well, Beth told Lori
that after you guys got together,

402
00:17:32.398 --> 00:17:34.034
you totally blew her off.
I didn't blow her off!

403
00:17:34.036 --> 00:17:35.048
She said you never called her.

404
00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:37.469
Look, I'm leaving, alright?
So what am I supposed to do?

405
00:17:37.515 --> 00:17:39.190
I don't know, man.
She was heartbroken.

406
00:17:39.315 --> 00:17:41.954
Look, there is no together. It's just
her and me, two separate things.

407
00:17:42.694 --> 00:17:43.819
It's better if we just stay friends.

408
00:17:43.938 --> 00:17:45.137
Not that I feel like
I'm not good enough for her!

409
00:17:45.139 --> 00:17:46.114
No, no, stop! Stop!

410
00:17:46.116 --> 00:17:47.388
I didn't say feel Rob.

411
00:17:47.692 --> 00:17:49.317
You're not good enough for her.

412
00:17:49.362 --> 00:17:50.062
That's it.

413
00:17:50.277 --> 00:17:52.119
That's fact. That's science.

414
00:17:52.363 --> 00:17:55.991
Beth Mclntyre is like from
a whole another planet, man.

415
00:17:55.994 --> 00:17:58.302
She's beautiful. She's charming.

416
00:17:58.566 --> 00:18:01.064
And you. I love you but let's face it,

417
00:18:01.066 --> 00:18:02.457
you're kind of a douche bag.

418
00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:03.766
And going to Japan,

419
00:18:03.963 --> 00:18:05.387
is not gonna fix that.

420
00:18:05.389 --> 00:18:07.212
She's crazy about you, bro.

421
00:18:07.336 --> 00:18:10.563
Like, right now, as you are.
Yeah. And you're in love with her.

422
00:18:10.565 --> 00:18:12.344
But you got to go after her.
It's not that simple.

423
00:18:12.383 --> 00:18:14.634
No, it is that simple, Rob.
Come on, man. Don't be scared.

424
00:18:14.719 --> 00:18:16.276
It's about moments, man.

425
00:18:16.278 --> 00:18:17.011
That's all that…

426
00:18:17.013 --> 00:18:19.264
You got to learn to say,
Forget the world,

427
00:18:19.348 --> 00:18:21.892
and hang on to the people
that you care about the most.

428
00:18:22.685 --> 00:18:24.319
Oh, God. Oh, God.

429
00:18:24.321 --> 00:18:25.186
Oh, my God!

430
00:18:25.367 --> 00:18:26.593
What the hell was that?

431
00:18:28.543 --> 00:18:29.226
Help!

432
00:18:30.651 --> 00:18:32.300
That scared the shit out of me.

433
00:18:32.862 --> 00:18:33.601
Lily!

434
00:18:34.577 --> 00:18:35.123
Lil!

435
00:18:35.531 --> 00:18:36.966
Did you feel that?
It was like an earthquake.

436
00:18:37.366 --> 00:18:38.450
You guys.
Lil, where are you?

437
00:18:38.452 --> 00:18:39.413
What was that?

438
00:18:39.741 --> 00:18:40.359
What was that?

439
00:18:40.361 --> 00:18:41.916
Hey. Are you alright?
Oh, my God.

440
00:18:41.996 --> 00:18:43.288
Yeah, that was really scary.
Did you see anything?

441
00:18:43.372 --> 00:18:45.313
Hey, Marlena!
Marlena, are you ok?

442
00:18:46.154 --> 00:18:47.093
Guys, look out!

443
00:18:48.336 --> 00:18:49.461
Ok.
It was like a bomb.

444
00:18:49.545 --> 00:18:51.213
Alright, here we go. Here we go.
Here we go. Here we go.

445
00:18:51.714 --> 00:18:53.415
Wait.
Everyone quiet down. Alright?

446
00:18:53.593 --> 00:18:55.050
<i>But now, just approximately</i>
Shut up, shut up.

447
00:18:55.052 --> 00:18:56.076
<i>15 minutes</i>
Guys! Come on.

448
00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:57.350
<i>After word</i>

449
00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:00.230
<i>of a possible earthquake
in Lower Manhattan.</i>

450
00:19:00.269 --> 00:19:01.214
<i>Nearby,</i>

451
00:19:01.376 --> 00:19:04.462
<i>in New York Harbour,
we're getting word of an oil tanker</i>

452
00:19:04.655 --> 00:19:06.644
<i>capsizing in the middle of the harbour,</i>

453
00:19:06.821 --> 00:19:08.920
<i>near the Statue of Liberty.</i>

454
00:19:09.127 --> 00:19:10.642
<i>Once again.</i>
Dude, that's really close.

455
00:19:10.678 --> 00:19:12.750
<i>There's no way to know if any</i>
That's really, really close.

456
00:19:12.944 --> 00:19:14.861
That's true. Do you think
we could see something from the roof?

457
00:19:14.863 --> 00:19:15.869
I don't know. Maybe.

458
00:19:15.931 --> 00:19:17.664
I wanna go to the roof.
Come on, Jason.

459
00:19:17.666 --> 00:19:18.864
Let's go see if we can see
something on the roof.

460
00:19:18.866 --> 00:19:20.074
Come on, Jason.
We're not going up to the roof.

461
00:19:20.076 --> 00:19:21.586
Yeah, let's go up there.
I don't think we should.

462
00:19:23.788 --> 00:19:24.654
No, what!

463
00:19:25.249 --> 00:19:26.133
That was really…

464
00:19:27.375 --> 00:19:29.377
What do you think?
Think it's another terrorist attack?

465
00:19:29.379 --> 00:19:30.383
It's insane, man.

466
00:19:30.845 --> 00:19:31.917
Watch your step.

467
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:43.460
It was shaking everywhere, man.
Just like tremors.

468
00:19:43.462 --> 00:19:46.089
Yeah, it's on the news downstairs.
Is this the only lights that went out?

469
00:19:46.143 --> 00:19:47.727
I think they blew up the trains.
No, a couple did.

470
00:19:47.729 --> 00:19:49.338
Some stayed on.

471
00:19:50.356 --> 00:19:51.721
Oh, man. What is going on?

472
00:19:52.275 --> 00:19:54.212
Maybe you should have left town
a little bit earlier, right?

473
00:19:54.443 --> 00:19:55.735
Shut up.

474
00:19:57.154 --> 00:19:58.366
Oh, my God!

475
00:20:00.741 --> 00:20:01.908
No, no, no.

476
00:20:02.618 --> 00:20:04.911
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

477
00:20:08.416 --> 00:20:10.500
Hud. Move. Hud!

478
00:20:26.923 --> 00:20:27.851
Oh, God.

479
00:20:28.769 --> 00:20:32.314
Rob, you got a set of keys?
Get out of here!

480
00:20:33.441 --> 00:20:35.031
Right, did you look back?
Did anybody get hurt?

481
00:20:35.033 --> 00:20:36.917
Did anybody see Jason or not?
I don't know.

482
00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:39.141
Did anybody see Jason?

483
00:20:39.595 --> 00:20:40.952
Has anybody seen Jason?

484
00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:42.602
Did anybody see Jason?
Is he inside?

485
00:20:48.039 --> 00:20:50.548
Oh, my God! Oh! Oh, shit!

486
00:20:51.292 --> 00:20:53.209
Oh, Jesus Christ!

487
00:20:53.211 --> 00:20:55.258
Oh, God! Oh, God!

488
00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:56.687
Oh, my God!

489
00:20:57.126 --> 00:20:58.514
Oh, my God!

490
00:20:59.884 --> 00:21:00.987
Oh, my God!

491
00:21:10.051 --> 00:21:10.911
Let's go!

492
00:21:12.647 --> 00:21:14.731
You got to take your stuff
and we got to get out of here, man!

493
00:21:14.802 --> 00:21:15.732
I'm telling you!
Lyl!

494
00:21:16.648 --> 00:21:17.788
I'm so sorry.
Where were you?

495
00:21:17.829 --> 00:21:18.926
I'm so sorry.

496
00:21:25.868 --> 00:21:26.837
Hey, did you guys see that?

497
00:21:28.201 --> 00:21:29.477
Did you guys just see that?

498
00:21:48.766 --> 00:21:50.209
Hey, get down! Get down!

499
00:21:50.211 --> 00:21:51.074
You alright?

500
00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:53.221
You alright? Yeah,

501
00:21:53.223 --> 00:21:54.281
Did you guys see that?

502
00:21:54.289 --> 00:21:55.361
Did you guys see that?

503
00:22:01.237 --> 00:22:02.962
There are people still out there.

504
00:22:12.915 --> 00:22:15.117
Rob! Rob!
Hey, Rob, I saw it! Rob!

505
00:22:17.586 --> 00:22:18.840
Rob.
What?

506
00:22:19.255 --> 00:22:20.193
Rob, I saw it!
What?

507
00:22:20.423 --> 00:22:21.640
What's he saying?
It's alive.

508
00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:34.533
Stay down, Lily!
Get back!

509
00:22:42.945 --> 00:22:44.571
He's going away now.

510
00:22:44.947 --> 00:22:46.758
Jason, what are you doing?
Jason, where are you going?

511
00:22:47.116 --> 00:22:48.202
Lily, just wait.

512
00:22:50.286 --> 00:22:51.427
Jason, don't go out.

513
00:22:51.634 --> 00:22:53.538
Jason, don't!
Lily, just wait here!

514
00:22:53.622 --> 00:22:55.437
Hey, Rob! Rob!
Where's he going, dude?

515
00:22:55.791 --> 00:22:56.895
Jason!
Rob?

516
00:22:58.156 --> 00:22:58.753
Rob!

517
00:23:19.648 --> 00:23:20.496
Oh, my God.

518
00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:22.694
Marlena?
Oh, God.

519
00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:23.660
Are you ok?

520
00:23:23.662 --> 00:23:25.907
Wait, come here.
Come here. Sit down.

521
00:23:47.009 --> 00:23:48.689
It walked right through
that street over there.

522
00:23:49.204 --> 00:23:51.646
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
It walked right over my head.

523
00:23:52.014 --> 00:23:54.350
What?
That's the sound it's making.

524
00:23:55.293 --> 00:23:57.461
You said you saw something, right?
So what did you see?

525
00:23:57.478 --> 00:23:59.729
You said it was alive? What was it?
Who cares what it…

526
00:23:59.855 --> 00:24:03.525
I don't know, man. I don't know.
I mean, I was taping. I can show you.

527
00:24:03.651 --> 00:24:05.827
Hey, you guys!
I have it on tape!

528
00:24:05.829 --> 00:24:07.560
Well, then rewind it.
Rewind it. Rewind it.

529
00:24:07.655 --> 00:24:09.092
Yeah. Here, here.
Let me rewind it…

530
00:24:09.155 --> 00:24:10.405
<i>It's gonna be a great opportunity for you.</i>

531
00:24:10.407 --> 00:24:11.847
<i>Yeah, but I don't even speak
the language. v</i>

532
00:24:12.034 --> 00:24:13.674
<i>Oh, come on.
How hard could it be?</i>

533
00:24:13.676 --> 00:24:16.319
<i>It's Japanese.
It's Japanese-hard.</i>

534
00:24:18.165 --> 00:24:19.167
<i>It'll be fine.</i>

535
00:24:19.534 --> 00:24:21.135
<i>Do you really think I should go?</i>

536
00:24:22.378 --> 00:24:23.378
Oh, my God.
That makes no sense.

537
00:24:23.391 --> 00:24:25.602
That makes no sense.
Did you see it?

538
00:24:26.215 --> 00:24:28.505
I don't know what it was, of course!
It was giant.

539
00:24:28.507 --> 00:24:30.276
It was like…
Did you see that thing?

540
00:24:30.928 --> 00:24:32.971
I'm not yelling at you, alright?
Yes, you are!

541
00:24:33.055 --> 00:24:34.973
Hey, guys, guys, come on!
Everybody just calm down!

542
00:24:35.057 --> 00:24:37.517
Quiet, guys.
Alright. Come on, just shut up!

543
00:24:37.601 --> 00:24:40.311
Alright? We don't know what we saw!
The point is it's still here!

544
00:24:40.396 --> 00:24:42.327
Alright? So we need to get
the hell out of Manhattan!

545
00:24:42.773 --> 00:24:43.975
Now.
Yeah, yeah.

546
00:24:44.567 --> 00:24:46.234
And out to the Brooklyn Bridge.
I think it's the best plan.

547
00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.278
It's a straight shot to Delancey.
Just take the Williamsburg.

548
00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:50.284
No. Do you know how far that is?
Brooklyn is right there.

549
00:24:50.447 --> 00:24:52.718
No, no, no, dude. It's so much closer.
It's right here.

550
00:24:53.059 --> 00:24:54.838
Centre Street's like a block away.
What's going on?

551
00:24:54.884 --> 00:24:57.618
I think we're gonna get out of here.
Is she ok to…

552
00:24:57.788 --> 00:25:00.288
ok, yeah. Yeah, ok. Marlena,
we're gonna get out of here, ok?

553
00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:03.250
It was eating people.
It was eating everyone.

554
00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:07.380
We got to go!
Go! Let's go!

555
00:25:07.756 --> 00:25:08.756
Ok, come here.

556
00:25:08.883 --> 00:25:11.397
Go, go, go, go, go.
I don't think… Don't even look.

557
00:25:16.932 --> 00:25:18.391
Is anyone's phone working?
What?

558
00:25:18.475 --> 00:25:19.934
Hud, is your phone working?
What?

559
00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:22.604
No…
Shit! I left it in the apartment.

560
00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:24.230
There's no signal.
You're not getting a signal either?

561
00:25:24.315 --> 00:25:25.392
No, no, come on.

562
00:25:25.774 --> 00:25:27.483
Hud, come on!
What? Ok.

563
00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:38.682
It's alright.

564
00:25:39.455 --> 00:25:40.212
Let's go.

565
00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:41.831
We need an IV.

566
00:25:41.957 --> 00:25:43.041
Calm down, please.
Let's go, people.

567
00:25:43.125 --> 00:25:44.417
Let's go. Let's go.
Excuse me, Officer.

568
00:25:44.501 --> 00:25:46.085
Do you know…
What was that thing? What was it?

569
00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:47.754
Look, if you're not injured,
you got to keep moving, man.

570
00:25:47.838 --> 00:25:49.973
Let's go! Let's go, people! Let's go!

571
00:25:50.799 --> 00:25:52.775
Yeah, once we get to the bridge,
we'll be safe.

572
00:25:53.302 --> 00:25:54.317
Hey, how are you?

573
00:25:55.408 --> 00:25:56.303
Is she doing better?

574
00:25:56.305 --> 00:25:58.014
She's ok.
She's gonna be fine.

575
00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:00.899
Marlena, you saw it. What was that?
Not now, Hud.

576
00:26:03.179 --> 00:26:03.995
Sorry.

577
00:26:08.651 --> 00:26:11.013
<i>Please go in an orderly manner.</i>

578
00:26:11.362 --> 00:26:14.155
<i>Continue moving south towards Brooklyn.</i>

579
00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:16.908
Just keep going.
Yeah, I don't know. It got hit.

580
00:26:18.661 --> 00:26:21.037
Once we get over there,
I'll go to my cousin's house.

581
00:26:21.163 --> 00:26:22.830
She has a condo.
She's out of town.

582
00:26:27.753 --> 00:26:31.172
<i>I repeat, do not stop.
Keep moving.</i>

583
00:26:32.174 --> 00:26:34.618
<i>There will be instructions
on the Brooklyn side…</i>

584
00:26:35.344 --> 00:26:37.302
<i>Get across the bridge.</i>

585
00:26:38.214 --> 00:26:40.683
<i>Move in a quick and orderly fashion.</i>

586
00:26:50.901 --> 00:26:52.192
You still filming?
Yeah.

587
00:26:52.528 --> 00:26:53.957
People are gonna wanna know,

588
00:26:54.457 --> 00:26:55.698
how it all went down.

589
00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:58.519
Well, you can just tell them
how it all went down, Hud.

590
00:26:58.521 --> 00:26:59.914
No, that would not work.

591
00:27:00.202 --> 00:27:01.997
People need to see this, you know?

592
00:27:02.593 --> 00:27:03.776
This is gonna be important.

593
00:27:03.778 --> 00:27:05.203
I mean, people are gonna watch this.

594
00:27:05.416 --> 00:27:07.417
Beth? Beth?
Rob!

595
00:27:08.877 --> 00:27:10.538
Beth, I've been trying to reach you.
Are you ok?

596
00:27:11.581 --> 00:27:12.427
Hello?

597
00:27:12.715 --> 00:27:13.951
Wait a second, you guys!

598
00:27:13.953 --> 00:27:15.234
Look, hey!

599
00:27:15.236 --> 00:27:16.553
Lily, stop!

600
00:27:17.803 --> 00:27:19.762
I'm sorry. It's really loud here.
Can you speak up?

601
00:27:19.764 --> 00:27:20.388
Lily!

602
00:27:22.391 --> 00:27:24.267
What?
Rob got a hold of Beth.

603
00:27:24.643 --> 00:27:26.089
Wait! Jason, wait!

604
00:27:26.729 --> 00:27:28.730
Rob's got Beth on the phone!
What'd you say?

605
00:27:28.814 --> 00:27:30.898
What?
Hey, you all, come on.

606
00:27:30.983 --> 00:27:32.713
Rob's got Beth on the phone!

607
00:27:32.735 --> 00:27:35.528
Ok, Beth, you're gonna
have to calm down, ok?

608
00:27:35.565 --> 00:27:36.457
Where are you?

609
00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:38.982
What do you mean, you can't move?

610
00:27:39.325 --> 00:27:41.625
What?
<i>I repeat, no panicking.</i>

611
00:27:47.291 --> 00:27:48.511
Did you see it?

612
00:28:05.476 --> 00:28:06.608
Jason!

613
00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:08.103
Can you see anything?

614
00:28:08.187 --> 00:28:09.645
No, I can't get over there!

615
00:28:09.772 --> 00:28:12.104
I can't… I can't see anything!
Can you see it?

616
00:28:12.436 --> 00:28:13.469
Jason!

617
00:28:13.817 --> 00:28:15.611
Why did you stop?
Jason!

618
00:28:15.986 --> 00:28:17.748
What?
Jason, watch out!

619
00:28:23.952 --> 00:28:27.040
Jason! No, Jason! No!

620
00:28:31.126 --> 00:28:32.377
Jason!

621
00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:34.492
No!

622
00:28:34.494 --> 00:28:35.589
God!

623
00:28:35.591 --> 00:28:38.886
No, Jason! Jason! Lily, come on!

624
00:28:38.888 --> 00:28:40.142
Jason! No!

625
00:28:57.653 --> 00:28:59.114
Go, go, go, go!

626
00:29:26.181 --> 00:29:28.039
Lily. Lily, wait. Stop!

627
00:29:28.065 --> 00:29:31.152
Stop! Turn around and listen
to me right now.

628
00:29:31.437 --> 00:29:33.479
Would somebody please,
please tell me what just happened?

629
00:29:33.481 --> 00:29:36.507
I don't know. I mean,
it came, it came out of nowhere!

630
00:29:36.525 --> 00:29:38.067
And he was there and then he was gone!
I know. I know.

631
00:29:38.193 --> 00:29:39.877
My God! Jason!

632
00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:41.853
Jason!
Lily, I'm so, so sorry.

633
00:29:41.864 --> 00:29:43.188
Rob. You got to listen to me, man.

634
00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:45.011
I am so sorry
about your brother.

635
00:29:45.284 --> 00:29:46.257
I'm sorry, man.

636
00:29:46.259 --> 00:29:47.133
I'm so sorry.

637
00:29:47.705 --> 00:29:48.690
Are you ok?

638
00:29:49.192 --> 00:29:49.864
Rob?

639
00:29:52.416 --> 00:29:53.740
Oh, shit.

640
00:29:53.835 --> 00:29:54.527
Ok.

641
00:29:54.876 --> 00:29:55.462
Alright.

642
00:29:57.588 --> 00:30:00.548
Rob. Rob, dude.
We can't stay here.

643
00:30:01.049 --> 00:30:03.926
We can't.
Rob. We got to get out of here, man.

644
00:30:04.052 --> 00:30:05.051
Listen to me.

645
00:30:05.053 --> 00:30:06.889
We got… We got to get moving, man.

646
00:30:07.306 --> 00:30:08.848
We go to the Manhattan Bridge,
you know?

647
00:30:08.932 --> 00:30:10.641
We got to get out of here.
It's not safe here.

648
00:30:10.726 --> 00:30:11.971
Ok, we can go to the other side.

649
00:30:11.973 --> 00:30:13.077
We can try and get...

650
00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:14.868
to the Lincoln Tunnel.
I don't know, man.

651
00:30:15.089 --> 00:30:15.918
I don't know, but…

652
00:30:16.482 --> 00:30:18.318
Dude, we got to get out of here.

653
00:30:18.655 --> 00:30:20.005
It's not safe here.

654
00:30:21.111 --> 00:30:22.151
What are we gonna do, Rob?

655
00:30:23.158 --> 00:30:24.239
What are we gonna do?

656
00:30:26.241 --> 00:30:27.373
Do you know? Hey!

657
00:30:29.077 --> 00:30:32.079
Look… Hey, Jesus. Rob. Hey, Rob?

658
00:30:32.748 --> 00:30:33.895
No.
Rob!

659
00:30:34.166 --> 00:30:36.057
My battery's dead.
Yeah, dude, I…

660
00:30:36.251 --> 00:30:37.875
Well, listen, we got
to get out of here, man.

661
00:30:38.335 --> 00:30:39.127
You know?

662
00:30:39.129 --> 00:30:40.338
Rob! Rob!
Well, where's he going?

663
00:30:40.422 --> 00:30:41.500
Where are you going?

664
00:30:42.007 --> 00:30:43.025
Oh, God.

665
00:30:43.027 --> 00:30:44.676
I'll go get him. Hey, Rob!

666
00:30:46.261 --> 00:30:46.955
Rob!

667
00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:48.280
Dude!

668
00:30:48.381 --> 00:30:50.957
I can't take all this running, man!

669
00:30:51.177 --> 00:30:51.724
Rob!

670
00:30:52.601 --> 00:30:53.318
Hey, Rob.

671
00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:57.396
Excuse me. Hey, Rob!
The store's closed, man!

672
00:30:57.481 --> 00:30:59.732
Rob, Rob!
<i>Burning right now.</i>

673
00:30:59.816 --> 00:31:03.641
<i>The bridge was filled
with pedestrians traveling across.</i>

674
00:31:03.862 --> 00:31:05.112
<i>It has collapsed.</i>
Holy shit.

675
00:31:05.114 --> 00:31:07.198
<i>No word on injuries yet, but…</i>

676
00:31:09.117 --> 00:31:10.618
Oh, God.

677
00:31:13.956 --> 00:31:16.582
<i>We continue now with our breaking
news story in lower Manhattan.</i>

678
00:31:16.667 --> 00:31:20.503
<i>We are getting some truly extraordinary
live images here in the studio.</i>

679
00:31:20.629 --> 00:31:21.901
<i>For those of you just joining us,</i>

680
00:31:21.903 --> 00:31:24.678
<i>Lower Manhattan is in
an absolute state of siege</i>

681
00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:25.782
<i>in what has been…</i>

682
00:31:31.723 --> 00:31:34.458
<i>This is a mandatory evacuation.</i>

683
00:31:34.851 --> 00:31:37.270
<i>Proceed south immediately.</i>

684
00:31:37.354 --> 00:31:40.648
<i>Get out of the city in an orderly fashion.</i>

685
00:31:40.732 --> 00:31:43.222
<i>This is a mandatory evacuation!</i>

686
00:31:43.224 --> 00:31:45.396
<i>We need everyone
out of this area now!</i>

687
00:31:45.398 --> 00:31:46.964
Hey Rob? Rob!
Hey, dude!

688
00:31:47.072 --> 00:31:49.265
Actually, I think we need to get out
of here, like right now!

689
00:31:49.267 --> 00:31:52.014
Do you know what I'm saying? Because
there is some serious shit going on outside!

690
00:31:52.016 --> 00:31:54.100
Rob? No, like, you know what I mean?

691
00:31:54.102 --> 00:31:56.080
Rob, like there is some
strange shit going on!

692
00:31:56.082 --> 00:31:57.022
Rob?

693
00:31:59.627 --> 00:32:00.672
What's going on?

694
00:32:01.471 --> 00:32:03.349
<i>Can you tell us what it looks like
on the ground there?</i>

695
00:32:03.351 --> 00:32:06.462
<i>Well, Bob, the military will not
let us get too close,</i>

696
00:32:06.464 --> 00:32:10.174
<i>but from what we can see,
there is clearly a sizable mobilization</i>

697
00:32:10.176 --> 00:32:11.344
<i>of troops and equipment,</i>

698
00:32:11.346 --> 00:32:13.263
<i>and they're trying to get everyone
to Leave the area…</i>

699
00:32:13.265 --> 00:32:15.349
<i>To be honest, Tom, your guess
is as good as mine at this point.</i>

700
00:32:15.434 --> 00:32:17.851
<i>There appears to be
something coming off of it.</i>

701
00:32:17.907 --> 00:32:20.075
<i>And the ground seems
to be covered in debris…</i>

702
00:32:20.105 --> 00:32:21.731
<i>it looks like there is something
falling of it, doesn't it?</i>

703
00:32:21.857 --> 00:32:23.566
<i>Yes. Yes.
Yes, it does.</i>

704
00:32:23.692 --> 00:32:26.026
<i>There are pieces falling
all over the street.</i>

705
00:32:26.028 --> 00:32:28.058
<i>Whatever they are, they are moving.</i>
Oh, my God.

706
00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:28.946
<i>Oh, my God! They're…
Donna!</i>

707
00:32:29.031 --> 00:32:30.284
<i>They're right there!</i>
Oh, shit.

708
00:32:30.294 --> 00:32:31.138
<i>Donna, can you hear us?</i>
Hey!

709
00:32:32.214 --> 00:32:33.078
What are you doing?

710
00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:34.765
We got to get out of here!
Where is he?

711
00:32:34.767 --> 00:32:35.608
I know, that's what I've been telling him.

712
00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:36.735
Rob! Rob!
I've been trying to do that!

713
00:32:36.788 --> 00:32:38.661
Rob. Rob.
We got to go right now, ok?

714
00:32:38.796 --> 00:32:41.414
The military's evacuating everyone.
Hey Rob, listen to me, ok?

715
00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:42.705
We got to get out of here.

716
00:32:42.707 --> 00:32:44.385
It's time to leave the electronics store.

717
00:32:44.387 --> 00:32:45.451
Rob, come on.
We got to go.

718
00:32:45.453 --> 00:32:46.546
Just come on. Let's go…
Just stop it!

719
00:32:46.548 --> 00:32:47.844
Ok? Stop, wait!

720
00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:50.303
<i>To listen to your messages…</i>

721
00:32:53.722 --> 00:32:55.458
<i>Rob! Rob!</i>

722
00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:57.837
<i>I can't… Oh, God!</i>

723
00:32:58.439 --> 00:32:59.612
<i>I can't move.</i>

724
00:33:01.063 --> 00:33:02.884
<i>It fell. My apartment.</i>

725
00:33:02.886 --> 00:33:04.691
<i>The whole wall fell on me!</i>

726
00:33:06.109 --> 00:33:07.610
<i>I'm bleeding!</i>

727
00:33:07.758 --> 00:33:09.951
<i>I'm bleeding. I can't move.</i>

728
00:33:10.489 --> 00:33:11.773
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

729
00:33:15.452 --> 00:33:16.842
<i>Help me, Rob.</i>

730
00:33:17.746 --> 00:33:19.258
<i>To delete this message…</i>

731
00:33:33.804 --> 00:33:34.767
Rob, wait up!

732
00:33:35.184 --> 00:33:35.637
Rob!

733
00:33:35.829 --> 00:33:37.931
I got your message,
and I'm on my way there, ok?

734
00:33:37.933 --> 00:33:40.434
Hey, Rob, listen.
You got to think this through, man.

735
00:33:40.519 --> 00:33:42.437
Ok? Beth lives in Midtown.

736
00:33:42.639 --> 00:33:43.897
Midtown is that way.

737
00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:45.313
Guess what else is that way?
Will you wait up?

738
00:33:45.315 --> 00:33:47.692
Some horrific shit is in Midtown!
This is insane, ok?

739
00:33:47.776 --> 00:33:49.652
We're not gonna go near that thing, ok?

740
00:33:49.736 --> 00:33:51.452
We're not gonna go
to the middle of the city!

741
00:33:51.613 --> 00:33:52.560
No, we're not.

742
00:33:52.562 --> 00:33:53.682
You're not coming with me.
Look.

743
00:33:53.752 --> 00:33:55.093
Fall in with the military.
Fall in with the crowd.

744
00:33:55.095 --> 00:33:56.470
Let them gonna escort you out of here.

745
00:33:56.702 --> 00:33:57.427
Ok?

746
00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:00.121
Rob!
I'm sorry. I got to go.

747
00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:00.847
Rob!

748
00:34:01.832 --> 00:34:03.651
Rob! Rob! Listen!
Rob, wait a minute!

749
00:34:04.143 --> 00:34:05.833
One of us is gonna have to tackle you,

750
00:34:05.835 --> 00:34:08.378
and that's gonna be very uncomfortable
for everybody involved!

751
00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:09.864
Listen, you can't talk me out of it, ok?

752
00:34:09.872 --> 00:34:11.223
Look at me.
This is not me crazy.

753
00:34:11.592 --> 00:34:13.150
Alright? I know what I'm doing.

754
00:34:13.468 --> 00:34:14.651
And you can't talk me out of it.

755
00:34:14.703 --> 00:34:16.454
So turn around, go…
I'm coming.

756
00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:19.460
I'm coming with you.

757
00:34:20.475 --> 00:34:21.829
Lily, you don't have to do that.

758
00:34:21.852 --> 00:34:24.979
No, I want to. I'm coming.
Guys, did you not hear her message?

759
00:34:25.063 --> 00:34:26.814
I mean, even if we get to Beth's,
there is a chance

760
00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:28.125
that she's already…
Shut up.

761
00:34:33.739 --> 00:34:34.989
Guys, this is insane.

762
00:34:35.073 --> 00:34:35.893
Rob!

763
00:34:36.366 --> 00:34:37.823
You know what I'm talking about, right?

764
00:34:37.825 --> 00:34:39.076
You can't possibly think, Rob!

765
00:34:39.078 --> 00:34:40.171
That this is a good idea.
Rob!

766
00:34:40.287 --> 00:34:41.448
He. Hold…
Rob!

767
00:34:44.833 --> 00:34:46.240
I'm sorry, I don't understand you.

768
00:34:47.002 --> 00:34:49.079
Yeah, but I don't understand you.
Rob, hold up!

769
00:34:50.422 --> 00:34:52.171
Look, I'm sorry.
Hey, listen to me. Man.

770
00:34:52.173 --> 00:34:53.563
Hud!
I'm so sorry.

771
00:34:53.717 --> 00:34:55.413
Hey, Rob! Wait up, please!

772
00:34:55.426 --> 00:34:57.427
Rob! Have you tried maybe calling 911,

773
00:34:57.429 --> 00:34:59.434
see if somebody else can get there?
Yeah, I tried!

774
00:34:59.436 --> 00:35:01.158
Ok, well. I mean, what about police?

775
00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:02.511
Fire department?
I couldn't get through!

776
00:35:02.513 --> 00:35:03.673
I tried, I…
Ok, it just seems a little…

777
00:35:06.688 --> 00:35:09.231
Oh, shit.
Oh, my God!

778
00:35:38.762 --> 00:35:40.679
Oh! Oh, my God.

779
00:35:45.477 --> 00:35:47.478
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

780
00:35:49.147 --> 00:35:51.019
Rob! Rob!

781
00:35:51.546 --> 00:35:53.193
Hey, Rob!

782
00:36:00.992 --> 00:36:04.036
Hud! We're gonna go this way!
I can't hear you!

783
00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:06.914
Subway!
What? What?

784
00:36:08.083 --> 00:36:09.834
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
Come on! Come on!

785
00:36:09.836 --> 00:36:11.224
This shit is crazy, dude!

786
00:36:11.521 --> 00:36:12.318
Oh God!

787
00:36:21.054 --> 00:36:22.388
Oh, Rob, dude.
There's like…

788
00:36:27.269 --> 00:36:28.764
Hud! Hud!

789
00:36:29.563 --> 00:36:31.486
Are you ok, man?
You alright?

790
00:36:31.606 --> 00:36:34.095
Yeah. Yeah, I'm alright.
Come on.

791
00:36:34.176 --> 00:36:37.679
Ok. Ok. Oh, God damn.
Oh, shit.

792
00:36:44.619 --> 00:36:45.823
What the hell was that?

793
00:36:48.081 --> 00:36:50.181
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

794
00:36:50.332 --> 00:36:51.990
Did you see that?

795
00:36:51.992 --> 00:36:54.744
Oh, my God. Oh, God.
Did you see that?

796
00:37:13.523 --> 00:37:14.322
Ok.

797
00:37:17.527 --> 00:37:18.865
Hey, look. We can just cross…

798
00:37:18.867 --> 00:37:20.780
We can just cross to the other platform,

799
00:37:20.864 --> 00:37:22.480
then go up the stairs and see...

800
00:37:22.563 --> 00:37:24.328
if the other side of the street…
Rob, the other side of the street

801
00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:26.011
We can wait for there to be a lull,
looks the same as this side!

802
00:37:26.013 --> 00:37:27.944
And then make a break for it!
Rob, the air caught on fire!

803
00:37:27.946 --> 00:37:29.575
Ok? There's not gonna be a lull!

804
00:37:29.577 --> 00:37:30.745
But if we wait on the other…

805
00:37:30.747 --> 00:37:32.426
Listen to me man, I am with you, ok?

806
00:37:32.428 --> 00:37:33.499
I really, really am.

807
00:37:33.681 --> 00:37:34.689
I'm just saying,

808
00:37:34.824 --> 00:37:36.400
you got to listen
to what's going on up there.

809
00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:40.007
We can't…
Rob, he's right, ok?

810
00:37:40.091 --> 00:37:41.888
We have to wait.
We have to wait.

811
00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:46.773
This is insane.

812
00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:53.187
Shit!

813
00:38:10.872 --> 00:38:11.700
Oh, God.

814
00:38:11.702 --> 00:38:12.739
What?

815
00:38:14.233 --> 00:38:15.232
Rob, what?

816
00:38:18.463 --> 00:38:19.351
Hey, Mom.

817
00:38:21.007 --> 00:38:22.476
Yeah, no. I'm ok.

818
00:38:23.457 --> 00:38:24.928
Ok, yeah, we are.

819
00:38:25.011 --> 00:38:27.881
We're being evacuated right now.
The army's here.

820
00:38:27.948 --> 00:38:29.918
We're being evacuated,
so don't worry.

821
00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:32.078
Ok, but Mom. Mom, listen.

822
00:38:33.436 --> 00:38:35.906
We tried to get out of the city,

823
00:38:36.232 --> 00:38:38.714
and we took the Brooklyn Bridge,

824
00:38:39.734 --> 00:38:41.529
and we were right there when it hit.

825
00:38:44.072 --> 00:38:45.149
Jason's dead.

826
00:38:46.695 --> 00:38:48.395
Jason's dead, Mom.

827
00:39:45.258 --> 00:39:46.887
I don't know what to say to him.

828
00:39:50.013 --> 00:39:51.161
You know?

829
00:39:53.808 --> 00:39:56.202
Like, I feel like I should say something,

830
00:39:57.562 --> 00:39:59.063
but I don't know what to say.

831
00:40:18.083 --> 00:40:19.868
I'm not even supposed to be here.

832
00:40:22.545 --> 00:40:23.883
You didn't have to be.

833
00:40:24.493 --> 00:40:25.534
I mean...

834
00:40:27.217 --> 00:40:29.261
you had your chance in the alley.

835
00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:31.798
You could've left us.

836
00:40:34.933 --> 00:40:38.218
Yeah, you were supposed to meet up
with some friends or something, right?

837
00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:41.596
Yeah.

838
00:40:43.733 --> 00:40:44.762
I'm sorry.

839
00:40:48.613 --> 00:40:50.155
This isn't a bad idea.
Just walk.

840
00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:51.755
Wait, so then…
What's going on?

841
00:40:52.617 --> 00:40:53.355
I don't know.

842
00:41:00.792 --> 00:41:01.896
Just go across here.
That's good.

843
00:41:01.898 --> 00:41:02.585
Yeah.

844
00:41:02.669 --> 00:41:04.487
Yeah. This is the six.

845
00:41:04.489 --> 00:41:06.496
Rob, I don't think the trains
are running right now, man.

846
00:41:06.504 --> 00:41:08.395
No, we can just walk the track, see?
Yeah.

847
00:41:08.591 --> 00:41:09.160
Look.

848
00:41:09.370 --> 00:41:10.532
Beth lives here, Columbus Circle.

849
00:41:10.534 --> 00:41:12.572
We can just walk down
the six to Lexington and then...

850
00:41:12.635 --> 00:41:14.536
walk down Central Park South.
You want us to walk in the tunnels?

851
00:41:15.889 --> 00:41:17.419
It's either that or stay here.

852
00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:21.455
I'll walk the tunnels.

853
00:41:32.365 --> 00:41:33.450
I can't see.

854
00:41:33.658 --> 00:41:35.210
It's kind of freaking me out, you know?

855
00:41:35.293 --> 00:41:36.803
I think there is a light on the camera.

856
00:41:37.036 --> 00:41:37.925
Let me see.

857
00:41:38.214 --> 00:41:39.564
There is?
Yeah, right here.

858
00:41:40.565 --> 00:41:41.234
See?

859
00:41:46.337 --> 00:41:47.194
Ok.

860
00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:01.777
Ocean is big, dude.

861
00:42:02.517 --> 00:42:03.346
All I'm saying is,

862
00:42:03.348 --> 00:42:05.998
a couple of years ago,
they found a fish in Madagascar

863
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.900
that they thought had been
extinct for centuries.

864
00:42:07.902 --> 00:42:10.400
So what, it's been down there
this whole time and nobody noticed?

865
00:42:10.402 --> 00:42:11.041
Sure.

866
00:42:11.043 --> 00:42:13.487
Maybe it erupted from
an ocean trench, you know?

867
00:42:13.489 --> 00:42:14.623
Or a crevasse.

868
00:42:14.991 --> 00:42:16.951
Crevice. It's just a theory.

869
00:42:16.953 --> 00:42:17.703
I mean,

870
00:42:17.705 --> 00:42:20.038
for all we know, it's from
another planet and it flew here.

871
00:42:20.121 --> 00:42:21.202
Like Superman?

872
00:42:21.459 --> 00:42:22.576
Yeah, exactly like…

873
00:42:22.832 --> 00:42:24.729
Wait. You know who Superman is?

874
00:42:25.084 --> 00:42:26.518
Oh, my God.

875
00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:28.713
You know who Superman is?

876
00:42:28.796 --> 00:42:31.423
Ok, I'm not…
I'm, like, feeling something.

877
00:42:31.425 --> 00:42:32.757
Are you aware of Garfield?

878
00:42:32.995 --> 00:42:35.324
A lot of people think he's from a planet
that he's not actually from.

879
00:42:35.355 --> 00:42:37.766
I just can't stop thinking about how
the last thing I said to her was,

880
00:42:37.807 --> 00:42:39.163
Good luck tonight, Travis.

881
00:42:41.355 --> 00:42:42.854
She knows you didn't mean that.

882
00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:48.033
When I think of some of the things
I said to Jason.

883
00:42:48.733 --> 00:42:49.950
No, that's different.

884
00:42:50.444 --> 00:42:51.158
Why?

885
00:42:53.038 --> 00:42:54.702
Jason knew you loved him.

886
00:43:07.043 --> 00:43:09.366
Hey, do you guys remember
a couple of years ago,

887
00:43:09.449 --> 00:43:12.107
when that guy was lighting homeless
people on fire in the subways?

888
00:43:12.109 --> 00:43:13.026
Jesus, Hud.

889
00:43:13.257 --> 00:43:13.839
What?

890
00:43:13.841 --> 00:43:16.341
It's maybe not the best topic
for conversation down here.

891
00:43:16.719 --> 00:43:17.460
Right.

892
00:43:22.058 --> 00:43:24.853
I just can't stop thinking how scary
it would be if a flaming homeless guy

893
00:43:24.855 --> 00:43:26.039
came out of the dark right now.
Hud, seriously.

894
00:43:26.041 --> 00:43:26.918
Seriously. I'm just saying.

895
00:43:27.264 --> 00:43:27.993
Sorry.

896
00:43:31.985 --> 00:43:33.046
What was that?

897
00:43:33.931 --> 00:43:35.027
Let's just keep moving.

898
00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:37.019
Holy shit!

899
00:43:37.331 --> 00:43:39.166
Oh, God, this is nasty.

900
00:43:43.913 --> 00:43:45.426
This is disgusting.

901
00:43:45.665 --> 00:43:47.499
They're all running
in the same direction.

902
00:43:47.583 --> 00:43:48.888
Yeah, like they're running away.

903
00:43:49.155 --> 00:43:50.125
From what?

904
00:43:58.177 --> 00:44:00.053
Hey, how much farther?

905
00:44:00.138 --> 00:44:01.972
I don't know.
Let's get out at the next station.

906
00:44:02.056 --> 00:44:02.761
Ok?
Yeah.

907
00:44:04.863 --> 00:44:05.812
Did you guys hear that?

908
00:44:07.478 --> 00:44:09.353
What is that?
Just listen.

909
00:44:11.441 --> 00:44:14.318
I don't see anything.
Do you guys?

910
00:44:17.822 --> 00:44:20.490
Oh, man, this is the worst.
Will you be quiet for five seconds?

911
00:44:20.575 --> 00:44:22.276
Oh, turn on the night vision.
What?

912
00:44:23.036 --> 00:44:24.328
What do you mean?
It's right here.

913
00:44:24.412 --> 00:44:25.560
I got it. It's right here.

914
00:44:26.310 --> 00:44:27.021
There.

915
00:44:30.335 --> 00:44:31.215
Is it on?

916
00:44:31.586 --> 00:44:32.877
Oh, shit.

917
00:44:32.879 --> 00:44:33.895
What?
What?

918
00:44:34.088 --> 00:44:36.173
Run. Ok, run. Ok, run.
What?

919
00:44:36.257 --> 00:44:38.842
Hey, let's start running! Just run!
Just run! Just start running right now!

920
00:44:38.926 --> 00:44:40.976
Start running now! Run, run, run!

921
00:44:40.978 --> 00:44:43.431
Run! Just run!

922
00:44:43.514 --> 00:44:44.822
Lily!
You guys!

923
00:44:48.936 --> 00:44:50.354
Wait.

924
00:44:53.941 --> 00:44:54.862
Oh, God!

925
00:44:54.864 --> 00:44:56.463
Help! Please help!
Help! Help!

926
00:44:56.465 --> 00:44:57.672
You guys, help! Help!

927
00:45:08.915 --> 00:45:10.014
Marlena!

928
00:45:10.016 --> 00:45:10.844
Here!

929
00:45:12.877 --> 00:45:14.213
Come on. Let's go!

930
00:45:14.215 --> 00:45:15.919
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

931
00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:20.425
Hud!

932
00:45:29.268 --> 00:45:31.144
<i>There you go.
Totally not what I was thinking…</i>

933
00:45:46.356 --> 00:45:48.108
How are you doing over there, Marlena?

934
00:45:48.783 --> 00:45:49.816
You ok?

935
00:45:51.958 --> 00:45:53.136
You tell me.

936
00:45:55.294 --> 00:45:56.451
How does it look?

937
00:45:57.922 --> 00:45:59.204
Looks like it hurts.

938
00:46:00.174 --> 00:46:03.093
What do you mean? You're saying
this isn't attractive, like at all?

939
00:46:03.177 --> 00:46:04.177
A little bit.

940
00:46:12.437 --> 00:46:13.152
Here.

941
00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:16.022
Here, here. You can wash it off.
Thanks.

942
00:46:16.274 --> 00:46:16.982
Here.

943
00:46:17.621 --> 00:46:19.444
Did it get you, Hud?
Did it bite you, man?

944
00:46:19.446 --> 00:46:20.635
No, it didn't get me.

945
00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:23.182
Ok. Ok.

946
00:46:27.201 --> 00:46:27.893
Hey.

947
00:46:28.777 --> 00:46:29.567
Hey.

948
00:46:30.635 --> 00:46:32.219
So those things
came out of nowhere, right?

949
00:46:32.221 --> 00:46:32.849
Yeah.

950
00:46:33.405 --> 00:46:34.198
Oh, man.

951
00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:38.190
That one that grabbed me,
it was trying to drag me away.

952
00:46:38.796 --> 00:46:39.758
What's up with that?

953
00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:44.455
Maybe it liked you, Hud.

954
00:46:45.039 --> 00:46:45.651
Yeah.

955
00:46:46.137 --> 00:46:47.997
Maybe it was trying
to make me its queen.

956
00:46:52.977 --> 00:46:53.523
Hey,

957
00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:56.832
thanks for coming back and...

958
00:46:57.545 --> 00:46:58.918
helping me out, you know?

959
00:47:00.318 --> 00:47:03.124
What? You think that I'm the kind
of person that would not do that?

960
00:47:03.863 --> 00:47:04.482
No.

961
00:47:05.815 --> 00:47:07.441
No. I know you aren't.

962
00:47:08.576 --> 00:47:09.611
I was just saying, like...

963
00:47:11.727 --> 00:47:12.761
I'm glad you did.

964
00:47:17.084 --> 00:47:18.849
Otherwise, I would have been totally dead.

965
00:47:20.838 --> 00:47:21.562
Right?

966
00:47:22.548 --> 00:47:24.106
It's ok. You just got bit.

967
00:47:26.052 --> 00:47:26.733
Hey.

968
00:47:27.512 --> 00:47:29.133
Marlena's hurt pretty bad,

969
00:47:31.015 --> 00:47:31.557
you know?

970
00:47:31.933 --> 00:47:33.934
Well, we could wait here
for a little bit, I guess,

971
00:47:33.936 --> 00:47:35.819
and just hope those things
don't make it through the door.

972
00:47:35.850 --> 00:47:37.189
Yeah, ok. What's the next option?

973
00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:38.016
Well.

974
00:47:38.231 --> 00:47:39.677
Ok, we could see what's...

975
00:47:39.949 --> 00:47:41.151
what's out through this way.

976
00:47:41.153 --> 00:47:42.260
Maybe find another tunnel.

977
00:47:42.348 --> 00:47:43.562
No, no more tunnels.

978
00:47:45.029 --> 00:47:45.637
Then...

979
00:47:45.802 --> 00:47:47.349
I don't know. We try our luck up top.

980
00:47:48.741 --> 00:47:49.391
Ok,

981
00:47:50.012 --> 00:47:51.043
just to be clear,

982
00:47:51.241 --> 00:47:52.659
so our options are...

983
00:47:52.954 --> 00:47:53.828
die here,

984
00:47:54.236 --> 00:47:55.533
die in the tunnels,

985
00:47:55.535 --> 00:47:57.336
or die in the streets.

986
00:47:57.338 --> 00:47:58.015
Is that…

987
00:47:58.498 --> 00:47:59.932
Yeah, pretty much.
Pretty much the summing up of it?

988
00:47:59.934 --> 00:48:01.483
But wait, we don't even know
where we are, right?

989
00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:03.329
So, let's just go up and look around.

990
00:48:04.339 --> 00:48:05.772
See if we recognise anything.

991
00:48:07.426 --> 00:48:09.222
Do you think you'll be ok to walk?

992
00:48:09.224 --> 00:48:10.682
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.
Here, I'll help you.

993
00:48:33.578 --> 00:48:34.861
We're at 59th.
We're at 59th.

994
00:48:34.891 --> 00:48:36.126
Yeah.
We're at 59th.

995
00:48:49.552 --> 00:48:50.445
That's weird.

996
00:48:53.014 --> 00:48:54.139
What?

997
00:48:59.186 --> 00:49:00.312
Yeah.

998
00:49:15.870 --> 00:49:16.870
Hello!

999
00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:34.134
Marlena?

1000
00:49:34.930 --> 00:49:36.356
What's wrong?
Are you ok?

1001
00:49:38.851 --> 00:49:40.268
I'm really… I'm dizzy.

1002
00:49:40.394 --> 00:49:42.223
Yeah. Do you wanna sit down
for a second?

1003
00:49:46.525 --> 00:49:48.318
No, I'm fine.
She needs a doctor.

1004
00:49:48.402 --> 00:49:49.550
You sure?
I'm totally fine.

1005
00:49:49.632 --> 00:49:50.807
You know, because we could sit down

1006
00:49:50.809 --> 00:49:51.873
if you want to.
No, I'm fine, I'm fine.

1007
00:49:52.033 --> 00:49:53.411
We've got civilians!

1008
00:49:53.887 --> 00:49:54.700
Are there any more of you?

1009
00:49:54.784 --> 00:49:56.117
No, just us four.
It's just us.

1010
00:49:56.164 --> 00:49:57.522
We got four civilians here.

1011
00:49:58.287 --> 00:50:00.163
<i>Ok, bring them in.</i>
Roger.

1012
00:50:00.247 --> 00:50:02.319
Let's go, move. Move it.
Ok, ok.

1013
00:50:04.418 --> 00:50:05.973
Let's go!
Ok, ok.

1014
00:50:09.407 --> 00:50:10.652
Excuse me, sir?

1015
00:50:10.881 --> 00:50:12.248
Sir? Excuse me.

1016
00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:13.983
Listen, we need your help.

1017
00:50:13.985 --> 00:50:15.456
Our friend, she's hurt. She's trapped

1018
00:50:15.489 --> 00:50:17.047
in her building right by here,
at Columbus Circle.

1019
00:50:17.049 --> 00:50:18.429
That is not where you wanna be right now.

1020
00:50:18.476 --> 00:50:19.543
Do you guys know what it is?

1021
00:50:19.545 --> 00:50:20.832
Out there?
Do you know what that thing is?

1022
00:50:20.935 --> 00:50:22.232
If they know, they ain't telling me.

1023
00:50:22.234 --> 00:50:23.537
Whatever it is, it's winning.

1024
00:50:33.739 --> 00:50:35.425
What's up?
We got another bite here.

1025
00:50:36.356 --> 00:50:37.310
Oh my God.

1026
00:50:37.468 --> 00:50:38.219
Gross.

1027
00:50:41.247 --> 00:50:43.055
Please, we can't stay here. We have…
Hey, not now.

1028
00:50:43.057 --> 00:50:45.222
Copy that. Sir, we have two F-1
8s on route from Self ridge.

1029
00:50:45.224 --> 00:50:47.489
Four more are arming up,
maybe 30 minutes out.

1030
00:50:47.491 --> 00:50:48.471
Roger that.

1031
00:50:48.838 --> 00:50:50.081
Listen up, people.

1032
00:50:50.474 --> 00:50:51.799
Rack them and pack them.

1033
00:50:51.924 --> 00:50:54.050
We're phantoms in 15.
Sir.

1034
00:50:54.135 --> 00:50:56.052
Where the hell did you find them?
They were in the tunnels.

1035
00:50:56.137 --> 00:50:58.243
Yeah, we had to walk all the way
from Spring Street.

1036
00:50:58.305 --> 00:51:00.598
Get them ready for transport,
put them on the evac chopper.

1037
00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:02.726
Yes, sir. Let's move. Move, move.
No, wait. Wait.

1038
00:51:02.810 --> 00:51:04.260
Listen, our friend is very badly hurt.
Move it.

1039
00:51:04.262 --> 00:51:05.303
Move. Move.
We have to get to her.

1040
00:51:05.312 --> 00:51:06.844
Sorry, son, can't help you.
Get them on the chopper.

1041
00:51:06.846 --> 00:51:09.431
No, but, please, listen to me. Let go!
Just listen for a second, please!

1042
00:51:09.525 --> 00:51:11.023
Turn that goddamned camera…

1043
00:51:12.862 --> 00:51:14.523
We've been trying to get to her all…
Make our own way.

1044
00:51:15.448 --> 00:51:16.426
No, do you have a…

1045
00:51:16.428 --> 00:51:18.850
I am not jeopardizing
this operation or my men.

1046
00:51:18.852 --> 00:51:19.488
I don't want your help.

1047
00:51:19.493 --> 00:51:21.228
I just need you to listen to me
You are getting on that chopper now.

1048
00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:22.412
For one second, please.

1049
00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:24.720
You have no idea what's out there.
I don't care what's out there.

1050
00:51:24.722 --> 00:51:25.764
Listen to me. She's dying.

1051
00:51:25.766 --> 00:51:27.247
There is nothing I can do
about that now.

1052
00:51:27.249 --> 00:51:29.461
The girl that I love more than anything
is dying and it's my fault.

1053
00:51:29.545 --> 00:51:31.510
She should have been with me tonight,
and I let her go and…

1054
00:51:32.339 --> 00:51:34.299
And I get it, ok?
You have your hands full. I get that.

1055
00:51:34.383 --> 00:51:36.901
I get that, but we're gonna go after her,
and if you wanna stop me then...

1056
00:51:37.142 --> 00:51:38.874
you're gonna have to shoot me.
Hud.

1057
00:51:40.514 --> 00:51:42.279
I don't feel so good.

1058
00:51:42.550 --> 00:51:43.309
Oh, shit.

1059
00:51:43.392 --> 00:51:44.260
Bite!

1060
00:51:44.262 --> 00:51:45.874
We've got a bite!
Marlena!

1061
00:51:46.479 --> 00:51:47.604
Hold on a second.
Get her moving.

1062
00:51:47.688 --> 00:51:48.772
Keep moving!

1063
00:51:48.856 --> 00:51:50.982
Hey, Marlena, are you ok?
Hey, what are you guys doing?

1064
00:51:51.066 --> 00:51:52.984
Hold on a second.
Where are you taking her?

1065
00:51:53.068 --> 00:51:54.819
Hold on a second. Wait!
Oh my God, wait!

1066
00:51:54.904 --> 00:51:56.946
Marlena, stop! Just wait a second!
Let me go.

1067
00:51:57.031 --> 00:51:58.323
Just wait a second. Please.
Let me go.

1068
00:51:58.407 --> 00:51:59.949
Wait! Marlena!
Get out of the way.

1069
00:52:00.034 --> 00:52:01.647
Marlena! Hold on a second!

1070
00:52:01.783 --> 00:52:04.118
Just wait a… Let go of me! Stop it!
No.

1071
00:52:08.375 --> 00:52:11.419
God! Please, God!
Where are you taking Marlena?

1072
00:52:11.545 --> 00:52:12.754
Wait a second.

1073
00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:22.263
It's over. There is nothing you can do.

1074
00:52:22.389 --> 00:52:24.334
There is nothing you can do for her now.

1075
00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:26.543
It is over. It's over.

1076
00:52:27.937 --> 00:52:29.315
Rogers, clear out of here.

1077
00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:30.187
You sure?

1078
00:52:30.189 --> 00:52:31.614
I'll get them to the choppers from here.

1079
00:52:32.274 --> 00:52:33.455
Let's move out.

1080
00:52:34.074 --> 00:52:35.190
Oh, my God.

1081
00:52:36.348 --> 00:52:37.191
What just happened?

1082
00:52:37.216 --> 00:52:37.966
What just happened?

1083
00:52:38.016 --> 00:52:38.891
What just happened?

1084
00:52:39.578 --> 00:52:40.606
Let's go.

1085
00:52:40.608 --> 00:52:42.066
I should not be doing this shit.

1086
00:52:42.243 --> 00:52:42.930
Come on.

1087
00:52:43.248 --> 00:52:43.978
Come on.

1088
00:52:44.613 --> 00:52:45.330
Ok.

1089
00:52:45.412 --> 00:52:46.369
Let's go.
Ok.

1090
00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:47.236
Move.

1091
00:52:47.581 --> 00:52:49.040
Ok, move.
Come on.

1092
00:52:53.254 --> 00:52:54.537
You got to listen to me.

1093
00:52:55.714 --> 00:52:57.163
This girl, her building,

1094
00:52:57.165 --> 00:52:58.342
it's at Columbus Circle?

1095
00:52:58.425 --> 00:52:59.015
Yeah?

1096
00:52:59.937 --> 00:53:01.262
If you wanna go out in this,

1097
00:53:01.387 --> 00:53:02.559
I ain't gonna stop you.

1098
00:53:02.561 --> 00:53:03.639
But you got to know something.

1099
00:53:03.764 --> 00:53:05.817
The government's considering
the Hammer Down protocol,

1100
00:53:06.141 --> 00:53:08.017
which means they're willing
to let this whole area go.

1101
00:53:08.102 --> 00:53:10.374
You mean Midtown?
No, I mean Manhattan.

1102
00:53:10.813 --> 00:53:11.593
Come on.

1103
00:53:12.707 --> 00:53:14.017
We're taking one last shot at this thing.

1104
00:53:14.042 --> 00:53:15.042
Oh, God.
If that doesn't work,

1105
00:53:15.067 --> 00:53:16.568
they're leveling
the whole goddamned city.

1106
00:53:18.571 --> 00:53:20.029
Your watch is still working?
Yeah?

1107
00:53:20.114 --> 00:53:20.679
Alright.

1108
00:53:20.681 --> 00:53:22.741
The airlifts are leaving
from 40th and Park.

1109
00:53:22.825 --> 00:53:25.296
Last chopper's wheels-up at exactly 0600.

1110
00:53:25.953 --> 00:53:27.513
If you can make it there,
then they'll get you out.

1111
00:53:28.497 --> 00:53:30.351
Ok. Ok, thank you.

1112
00:53:30.353 --> 00:53:31.373
58th Street's right there.

1113
00:53:31.375 --> 00:53:33.084
Now, go. Move, move, move.
Let's go.

1114
00:53:33.168 --> 00:53:34.685
Let's go.
Go, go, go, go.

1115
00:53:37.464 --> 00:53:38.683
This is like a nightmare,

1116
00:53:38.959 --> 00:53:40.121
you know. It all happened so fast,

1117
00:53:40.123 --> 00:53:41.801
I couldn't even really see
what happened to her.

1118
00:53:42.428 --> 00:53:43.366
I mean, did you see it?

1119
00:53:43.462 --> 00:53:44.847
Could you see what happened, Hud?
No. Like...

1120
00:53:44.972 --> 00:53:46.064
No, her eyes started bleeding,

1121
00:53:46.066 --> 00:53:47.766
and then they were screaming
she was bitten.

1122
00:53:47.850 --> 00:53:49.550
And then she would not stop bleeding.

1123
00:53:49.849 --> 00:53:50.482
And…

1124
00:53:53.439 --> 00:53:54.471
Hud.

1125
00:53:57.109 --> 00:53:58.018
You ok?
Yeah.

1126
00:53:59.201 --> 00:54:01.363
Yeah I'm ok. I'm ok.

1127
00:54:05.159 --> 00:54:07.751
Look, guys, I don't mean to be…
But we don't have a lot of time.

1128
00:54:07.995 --> 00:54:11.039
Ok, so maybe you guys
should just stay here, and I'll go.

1129
00:54:11.041 --> 00:54:11.919
Alright?

1130
00:54:13.626 --> 00:54:14.883
I'm sorry. I just…

1131
00:54:14.885 --> 00:54:16.698
No, no, we're coming. We're coming.

1132
00:54:17.212 --> 00:54:18.171
Are you sure?

1133
00:54:18.505 --> 00:54:19.557
No, no, man.

1134
00:54:19.559 --> 00:54:20.868
No, we have to do this, ok?

1135
00:54:21.175 --> 00:54:22.424
We're with you. Let's go.

1136
00:54:22.426 --> 00:54:23.636
Let's go. Let's go right now.

1137
00:54:37.358 --> 00:54:38.338
Oh, my God.

1138
00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:39.443
Oh, my God.
What?

1139
00:54:39.526 --> 00:54:40.276
Oh, my God.

1140
00:54:40.278 --> 00:54:42.074
What is it? What?

1141
00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:43.967
Shit.

1142
00:54:44.201 --> 00:54:45.719
That's not Beth's place, is it?

1143
00:54:46.009 --> 00:54:47.361
Oh, my God.
Is that Beth's apartment?

1144
00:54:47.993 --> 00:54:48.776
Oh, my God.

1145
00:54:48.778 --> 00:54:49.707
Rob?

1146
00:54:50.355 --> 00:54:51.496
Is that her place?

1147
00:54:51.997 --> 00:54:53.385
Tell me that's not her place.

1148
00:54:53.465 --> 00:54:54.786
That's her place, yeah.

1149
00:54:56.043 --> 00:54:56.876
Oh, shit.

1150
00:54:57.384 --> 00:54:59.755
I don't suppose she lives
on the ground floor.

1151
00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:01.005
No, 39th.

1152
00:55:01.090 --> 00:55:02.799
Oh, great.
How do we even get up there?

1153
00:55:02.883 --> 00:55:06.251
I don't know. We just go inside
and then see how high we can get.

1154
00:55:08.722 --> 00:55:10.049
I don't know if I can do that.

1155
00:55:10.891 --> 00:55:13.469
Well, maybe we could try going up
the other building,

1156
00:55:14.019 --> 00:55:16.325
and then see if there is a place
to cross over onto her roof.

1157
00:55:16.855 --> 00:55:18.897
And then we could find some way
down to her place.

1158
00:55:21.610 --> 00:55:23.528
Wait. No, never mind.
No, that's a bad idea.

1159
00:55:23.612 --> 00:55:25.154
Hey, that's a bad idea.
I take that back.

1160
00:55:25.239 --> 00:55:27.008
No one ever listens to me, ever.

1161
00:55:27.723 --> 00:55:30.588
And now, of course,
they listen to me.

1162
00:55:30.911 --> 00:55:31.690
Great.

1163
00:55:34.707 --> 00:55:35.462
Shit.

1164
00:55:35.995 --> 00:55:36.736
Shit.

1165
00:55:37.292 --> 00:55:38.710
Probably not working.

1166
00:55:38.715 --> 00:55:40.090
What's going on?
Not working.

1167
00:55:40.254 --> 00:55:41.671
Wait, wait. Let's just…

1168
00:55:41.978 --> 00:55:42.894
Maybe…

1169
00:55:44.091 --> 00:55:45.675
No? No?
Shit.

1170
00:55:45.759 --> 00:55:47.942
Well, why don't you take the stairs?

1171
00:55:50.589 --> 00:55:52.097
You guys see that guy's face,

1172
00:55:52.561 --> 00:55:54.377
when Lily asked him what it was?
I mean,

1173
00:55:54.495 --> 00:55:55.971
they have no idea.

1174
00:55:57.771 --> 00:55:58.595
Unless...

1175
00:55:58.907 --> 00:56:00.616
Unless they're, like, in on it.

1176
00:56:00.929 --> 00:56:01.978
Jesus, Hud.

1177
00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:03.150
I don't read the papers.

1178
00:56:03.444 --> 00:56:05.175
Maybe our government made this thing.
Oh, yeah.

1179
00:56:05.184 --> 00:56:07.053
I mean, you know, maybe it was an accident,

1180
00:56:07.055 --> 00:56:08.281
or maybe it was on purpose…
Sure, maybe they did.

1181
00:56:08.407 --> 00:56:10.241
Does it really matter right now?
Yeah.

1182
00:56:11.326 --> 00:56:14.162
It matters because I need to talk
about something.

1183
00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:18.191
Otherwise, I'm actually probably
going to shit my pants in this stairwell.

1184
00:56:22.796 --> 00:56:23.838
I'm sorry.

1185
00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:27.721
Hey, wait, wait.
You guys hear that?

1186
00:56:27.942 --> 00:56:29.071
You guys hear that?

1187
00:56:30.804 --> 00:56:31.544
Yes.

1188
00:56:31.546 --> 00:56:33.212
Yeah.
Yeah, I think we're getting close.

1189
00:56:35.642 --> 00:56:37.023
Hud, I'm gonna check this floor.

1190
00:56:37.977 --> 00:56:38.586
Ok.

1191
00:56:46.111 --> 00:56:47.754
Ok, ok I think it's like,

1192
00:56:47.855 --> 00:56:49.073
two more up I think.

1193
00:56:49.156 --> 00:56:49.934
Ok.

1194
00:56:51.366 --> 00:56:52.658
Guys, guys, guys.

1195
00:56:53.452 --> 00:56:55.449
This one, it's got to be.
It's got to be this one.

1196
00:57:12.012 --> 00:57:13.012
Oh, God.

1197
00:57:18.977 --> 00:57:21.617
I don't think there is anybody here.

1198
00:57:22.297 --> 00:57:22.938
No.

1199
00:57:24.733 --> 00:57:25.754
Oh, Jesus.

1200
00:57:26.581 --> 00:57:27.610
Oh, my God.

1201
00:57:30.239 --> 00:57:31.209
Oh, my God.

1202
00:57:32.277 --> 00:57:33.017
Ok.

1203
00:57:33.242 --> 00:57:34.909
Ok, now, we can do this.
We can totally do this.

1204
00:57:35.035 --> 00:57:36.494
I don't know, Rob.
Look, it's a straight shot.

1205
00:57:36.578 --> 00:57:38.966
I don't know. I'm sorry.
Lily, Lily, it's a straight shot.

1206
00:57:39.039 --> 00:57:40.605
Look, it's a straight shot.
We could use…

1207
00:57:40.607 --> 00:57:42.617
There's pipes there.
We could use the air conditioners.

1208
00:57:43.925 --> 00:57:44.448
Ok?

1209
00:57:44.711 --> 00:57:47.085
Come on. We came this far.
We can do it. I'll go first.

1210
00:57:47.159 --> 00:57:48.530
Ok, ok, ok. Yes.
Alright? Ok.

1211
00:57:49.585 --> 00:57:50.517
Be careful, ok?
I'll...

1212
00:57:51.283 --> 00:57:52.244
I'll document it.

1213
00:57:53.242 --> 00:57:54.338
Come on. Come on.

1214
00:57:54.714 --> 00:57:55.088
Ok.

1215
00:57:55.769 --> 00:57:56.299
Ok.

1216
00:57:57.280 --> 00:57:57.726
Ok.

1217
00:57:59.641 --> 00:58:00.211
Ok.

1218
00:58:01.348 --> 00:58:03.230
Hud, come on! Put the
camera down! Come on!

1219
00:58:03.232 --> 00:58:04.562
Oh, Jesus.

1220
00:58:05.152 --> 00:58:07.233
Ok. Alright. Ok.
I'll go first.

1221
00:58:07.359 --> 00:58:09.383
Alright. If this is the last thing you see,

1222
00:58:10.362 --> 00:58:12.147
that means I died.

1223
00:58:12.149 --> 00:58:13.316
Hud, come on!
Ok.

1224
00:58:26.420 --> 00:58:28.212
Look out! Oh, shit…

1225
00:58:29.590 --> 00:58:30.222
Ok.

1226
00:58:33.051 --> 00:58:35.261
Ok. Ok.
Shit.

1227
00:58:40.142 --> 00:58:42.268
Ok. Ok.
Oh, God.

1228
00:58:54.907 --> 00:58:56.057
Yes. Ok.

1229
00:58:56.059 --> 00:58:57.159
You alright?
Yeah.

1230
00:58:57.284 --> 00:58:58.578
We're almost there, come on.

1231
00:59:01.788 --> 00:59:02.739
Come on, Hud.

1232
00:59:02.886 --> 00:59:03.472
Ok.

1233
00:59:07.755 --> 00:59:08.341
Shit.

1234
00:59:08.754 --> 00:59:09.493
Beth!

1235
00:59:10.316 --> 00:59:11.240
Beth!

1236
00:59:12.735 --> 00:59:13.534
Beth!

1237
00:59:23.101 --> 00:59:24.186
Can you get it?

1238
00:59:25.643 --> 00:59:26.813
Do you need help?

1239
00:59:27.814 --> 00:59:28.953
Do you need help?

1240
00:59:29.291 --> 00:59:29.889
Or…

1241
00:59:36.490 --> 00:59:38.045
Beth? Beth?

1242
00:59:41.662 --> 00:59:42.390
Beth?

1243
00:59:45.165 --> 00:59:45.790
Beth?

1244
00:59:47.037 --> 00:59:48.370
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1245
00:59:48.377 --> 00:59:49.361
What?
Shit.

1246
00:59:50.379 --> 00:59:54.019
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Beth.

1247
00:59:58.178 --> 00:59:59.512
Beth.
What?

1248
00:59:59.596 --> 01:00:00.379
Beth!

1249
01:00:01.848 --> 01:00:03.514
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1250
01:00:11.733 --> 01:00:12.724
Can you hear me?

1251
01:00:13.863 --> 01:00:14.599
Beth.

1252
01:00:32.045 --> 01:00:32.946
Hey.

1253
01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:39.399
Are you really here?
Yeah, I'm really here.

1254
01:00:41.888 --> 01:00:42.930
Rob?

1255
01:00:44.803 --> 01:00:46.970
You came back for me.

1256
01:00:47.769 --> 01:00:49.553
Of course I came back for you.

1257
01:00:51.898 --> 01:00:53.541
I'm sorry it took me so long.

1258
01:00:53.543 --> 01:00:55.608
No, it's ok.

1259
01:00:59.156 --> 01:01:01.343
Ok, ok, ok. You're ok.

1260
01:01:01.345 --> 01:01:02.701
We're gonna get you out of here, ok?

1261
01:01:02.784 --> 01:01:05.369
We'll get you out, alright?
Hud, put the camera down

1262
01:01:05.371 --> 01:01:07.163
and help me, ok?
Ok, ok.

1263
01:01:08.582 --> 01:01:09.707
It'll be ok.
Ok, here we go.

1264
01:01:09.791 --> 01:01:12.209
If we all just lift at the same time.
Hold on, ok. We got you.

1265
01:01:12.294 --> 01:01:14.045
Alright? We have to.
Don't do that, Rob.

1266
01:01:14.129 --> 01:01:15.755
Please don't do that.
It's gonna be over in a second.

1267
01:01:15.839 --> 01:01:16.922
Alright?
Ok. Ready, guys?

1268
01:01:17.007 --> 01:01:18.215
No, please. No.
Slowly. It's ok.

1269
01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:19.717
We're gonna do it real slow.

1270
01:01:19.801 --> 01:01:21.469
Easy, easy, just wait.
No, don't.

1271
01:01:21.595 --> 01:01:23.516
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

1272
01:01:27.601 --> 01:01:28.691
Oh, God.

1273
01:01:31.813 --> 01:01:33.247
Ok, now, sit down. Sit down.

1274
01:01:35.817 --> 01:01:36.911
I know. I know.

1275
01:01:37.062 --> 01:01:38.779
You're gonna be ok.
You're gonna be ok.

1276
01:01:41.448 --> 01:01:43.199
You're gonna be fine.
No, no, no.

1277
01:01:43.283 --> 01:01:45.341
I know, I know, I know it hurts.
I know it hurts.

1278
01:01:48.789 --> 01:01:50.190
What is that?

1279
01:01:51.458 --> 01:01:53.052
God.
It's a... It's a terrible thing.

1280
01:01:53.075 --> 01:01:54.506
Ok. We got to go. We got to go.
Ok. Let's go.

1281
01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:55.925
I got you.
Oh, God.

1282
01:01:56.171 --> 01:01:57.984
Oh, God. Alright. Alright.

1283
01:01:57.986 --> 01:01:59.341
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1284
01:01:59.466 --> 01:01:59.875
Go.

1285
01:02:00.198 --> 01:02:01.411
Ok. I got you.

1286
01:02:01.676 --> 01:02:02.903
You're gonna be ok.

1287
01:02:02.905 --> 01:02:03.970
You're gonna be ok, alright?

1288
01:02:04.054 --> 01:02:06.117
Just hold on to me.
You're gonna be alright.

1289
01:02:07.641 --> 01:02:08.833
You're gonna be ok, alright?

1290
01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:10.060
You're gonna be ok.

1291
01:02:14.314 --> 01:02:15.721
Ok. Hang on to me.

1292
01:02:15.723 --> 01:02:17.192
Oh, my God.

1293
01:02:17.317 --> 01:02:19.270
Ok, ok.
Oh, my God.

1294
01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:22.323
Ok.

1295
01:02:23.156 --> 01:02:24.217
Oh, shit.

1296
01:02:24.536 --> 01:02:26.493
Man, this is unbelievable.

1297
01:02:28.370 --> 01:02:29.307
Are you ok?

1298
01:02:29.782 --> 01:02:31.289
Just don't look down, ok?

1299
01:02:31.908 --> 01:02:33.542
I can't help it.
You're alright. You're alright.

1300
01:02:33.667 --> 01:02:34.721
Oh, my God.

1301
01:02:36.176 --> 01:02:37.012
Oh, my God.

1302
01:02:38.839 --> 01:02:40.005
Oh, God!

1303
01:02:40.841 --> 01:02:42.508
Ok, let's go.
Keep moving, just go.

1304
01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:44.718
Go, just go. Just go, go, go. Go.
Just get to the other side.

1305
01:02:44.845 --> 01:02:46.132
Come on, just keep moving.

1306
01:02:49.182 --> 01:02:50.182
Oh, my God.

1307
01:02:50.270 --> 01:02:51.044
Oh, my God.

Oh, shit!
Oh, my God!

1309
01:02:54.896 --> 01:02:57.098
Oh, my God. Did you see that?
Ok, come on.

1310
01:02:57.524 --> 01:02:58.449
Get inside.

1311
01:02:58.532 --> 01:02:59.732
Ok. Come on, come on.

1312
01:02:59.734 --> 01:03:00.890
Oh, God.

1313
01:03:00.978 --> 01:03:02.161
Go! Go!

1314
01:03:08.368 --> 01:03:10.372
Run! Run! Hurry!

1315
01:03:12.706 --> 01:03:13.874
Rob, come on!

1316
01:03:15.536 --> 01:03:16.418
Oh, my God.

1317
01:03:30.932 --> 01:03:32.308
Oh, my God.

1318
01:03:33.226 --> 01:03:35.393
What the hell was that?
I don't know.

1319
01:03:35.395 --> 01:03:37.352
Something else also terrible.

1320
01:03:38.398 --> 01:03:39.899
Rob, what time do the choppers take off?

1321
01:03:39.983 --> 01:03:41.859
0600.
What time is that?

1322
01:03:41.943 --> 01:03:44.570
6:00, Hud.
Yeah, ok. I knew that.

1323
01:03:47.991 --> 01:03:48.945
Come on, come on.

1324
01:03:49.435 --> 01:03:49.927
Ok.

1325
01:04:26.947 --> 01:04:27.947
Wait up!

1326
01:04:35.497 --> 01:04:37.957
Did we make it?
We want to get out of here, come on.

1327
01:04:39.292 --> 01:04:40.501
Let's go! Let's go!

1328

Come on! Come on!

1330
01:04:48.969 --> 01:04:50.134
You guys are on the next chopper.

1331
01:04:50.136 --> 01:04:51.929
No!
Clear this area. Clear this area.

1332
01:04:52.013 --> 01:04:53.257
No, no, wait. Wait.
Rob!

1333
01:04:53.259 --> 01:04:55.218
Rob! Rob!
Lily!

1334
01:04:55.564 --> 01:04:58.012
We'll be right behind you, ok?

1335
01:04:58.478 --> 01:05:00.611
Wait for us. Wait for us.

1336
01:05:00.613 --> 01:05:02.596
We'll be right behind you.

1337
01:05:05.652 --> 01:05:07.376
We're gonna be ok. Alright?

1338
01:05:07.378 --> 01:05:09.155
We're gonna be alright, you hear me?

1339
01:05:17.054 --> 01:05:17.721
Oh, God!

1340
01:05:20.494 --> 01:05:21.731
Jesus Christ!

1341
01:05:29.175 --> 01:05:30.787
Stay low. Stay low.

1342
01:05:30.789 --> 01:05:32.153
Come on, come on, come on.

1343
01:05:32.178 --> 01:05:33.084
Thank you.

1344
01:05:35.223 --> 01:05:36.634
They're starting the bomb run.

1345
01:05:36.636 --> 01:05:38.558
Get them out of here. Get going.

1346
01:05:49.029 --> 01:05:51.113
Oh, shit. Oh, my God.

1347
01:05:53.533 --> 01:05:54.370
Oh, my God.

1348
01:05:54.607 --> 01:05:56.161
Are you guys seeing this right now?

1349
01:05:56.244 --> 01:05:58.244
Are you seeing this right now?
Look, look, look.

1350

Are you seeing this shit right now?

1351

Oh, God.

1353
01:06:11.343 --> 01:06:12.630
Those aren't gonna hit us?

1354
01:06:14.471 --> 01:06:16.639
Oh, my God. They hit it!
They just hit it right now!

1355
01:06:16.723 --> 01:06:17.815
Look, you guys, they just hit it!

1356
01:06:17.817 --> 01:06:18.879
They hit it with…

1357
01:06:18.881 --> 01:06:20.366
Oh, my God!

1358
01:06:21.102 --> 01:06:22.739
Yeah, they hit it, you guys!
They hit it!

1359
01:06:22.741 --> 01:06:23.897
Oh, he's going down.

1360
01:06:24.314 --> 01:06:27.024
Target down. Target down.
Target down. He's down.

1361
01:06:27.108 --> 01:06:28.942
I think they got him.

1362
01:06:28.944 --> 01:06:31.611
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
That's the shit right there!

1363
01:06:31.613 --> 01:06:35.449
That's what I'm talking about…
Oh, my God! Oh, no, no, no!

1364
01:06:38.244 --> 01:06:40.871
Oh, my God. Oh my God.
God, please, God.

1365
01:06:40.914 --> 01:06:44.165
Please, God. Please.
Please, God and Jesus.

1366
01:06:44.167 --> 01:06:45.792
Jesus Christ, I'm sorry.

1367
01:06:45.794 --> 01:06:48.031
I'm so sorry, God. Please, no.

1368
01:06:48.421 --> 01:06:49.565
Help me, Rob!

1369
01:06:50.423 --> 01:06:53.759
Rob. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

01:07:50.859 --> 01:07:52.693
I know, I know. We're gonna
get you out of here. Come on.

1381
01:07:52.819 --> 01:07:54.316
Hud, come over to the other side.

1382
01:07:54.318 --> 01:07:55.987
Come on, come on.
You've got to pull him up.

1383
01:07:55.989 --> 01:07:57.990
Ok, ok.
I don't think I can move.

1384
01:07:58.074 --> 01:07:59.464
Yes, you can. Don't say that.

1385
01:07:59.592 --> 01:08:01.228
<i>Copy your last, we're on the move.</i>

1386
01:08:01.230 --> 01:08:02.745
<i>Good luck.</i>
Here, take his hand. Take his hand.

1387
01:08:02.829 --> 01:08:05.090
Hold on, I got it. I got it. I got it.
Come on, come on.

1388
01:08:09.502 --> 01:08:11.253
I got his legs, go!

1389
01:08:16.009 --> 01:08:16.759
My leg!

1390
01:08:16.761 --> 01:08:19.596
I know. I know, I know. I know.
I know. I know, I know. I know.

1391
01:08:19.598 --> 01:08:21.555
It's ok, you're fine. You're good.

1392
01:08:21.557 --> 01:08:23.021
I'm gonna have to stop the bleeding, ok?
You're ok. You're ok.

1393
01:08:23.044 --> 01:08:25.411
Ok? I'm not ok.
I'm not gonna be able to walk.

1394
01:08:25.413 --> 01:08:27.519
You are going to be able to walk.

1395
01:08:30.690 --> 01:08:31.647
Don't do it.

1396
01:08:33.358 --> 01:08:35.838
Ok. Alright, listen,
we got to get out of here, ok?

1397
01:08:35.865 --> 01:08:36.990
Well, which way do we go?

1398
01:08:37.030 --> 01:08:39.156
We have to get away from here,
because I think it's gonna explode.

1399
01:08:39.158 --> 01:08:41.993
Ok, ok. Ok.
Alright? Come on. Let's go.

1400
01:08:42.202 --> 01:08:44.661
Let's go this way. Come on.
Come on, you can walk. Ok.

1401
01:08:44.746 --> 01:08:46.167
Come on. Hold on, wait a second.

1402
01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:47.921
Hud!
Come on!

1403
01:08:47.923 --> 01:08:48.462
What?

1404
01:08:50.358 --> 01:08:51.075
Oh, no!

1405
01:08:53.797 --> 01:08:55.380
Hud!
What are you doing?

1406
01:09:04.637 --> 01:09:05.466
Hud!

1407
01:09:13.364 --> 01:09:14.238
Oh! No! No!

1408
01:09:26.128 --> 01:09:27.011
Hud!

1409
01:09:29.321 --> 01:09:30.126
Hud!

1410
01:09:32.547 --> 01:09:33.344
Hud!

1411
01:09:34.462 --> 01:09:35.251
Hud!

1412
01:09:36.099 --> 01:09:36.787
Hud!

1413
01:09:37.937 --> 01:09:38.643
Hud!

1414
01:09:39.121 --> 01:09:39.699
Hud!

1415
01:09:40.864 --> 01:09:41.481
Hud!

1416
01:09:42.103 --> 01:09:42.579
Hud!

1417
01:09:43.805 --> 01:09:44.635
Hud!

1418
01:10:23.469 --> 01:10:24.415
He's gone.

1419
01:10:31.019 --> 01:10:32.457
They're all gone.

1420
01:10:32.459 --> 01:10:33.396
I know.

1421
01:10:39.027 --> 01:10:40.063
We got to go.

1422
01:10:40.065 --> 01:10:41.739
We got to go.

1423
01:10:42.273 --> 01:10:43.981
We got to get out of here.

1424
01:10:44.032 --> 01:10:44.838
Where?

1425
01:10:45.903 --> 01:10:47.118
There's nowhere to go to.

1426
01:10:47.201 --> 01:10:49.453
We got to go. He's coming towards us.

1427
01:10:49.537 --> 01:10:52.223
No, we should just wait here.
Just wait here.

1428
01:10:52.665 --> 01:10:55.135
Listen, we wait here, they'll find us, alright?

1429
01:10:55.501 --> 01:10:56.758
They're fighting him right now.

1430
01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:58.171
If we wait here, they'll find us.

1431
01:10:58.254 --> 01:10:59.556
No, we can't stay.

1432
01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:05.761
It's ok. It's ok.

1433
01:11:09.265 --> 01:11:11.532
I'm so scared.
I know. I know. I know.

1434
01:11:40.797 --> 01:11:42.390
My name is Robert Hawkins.

1435
01:11:43.091 --> 01:11:47.886
It's 6:42 a.m. on Saturday, May 23.

1436
01:11:48.554 --> 01:11:50.775
Approximately seven hours ago,

1437
01:11:50.777 --> 01:11:52.517
something attacked the city.

1438
01:11:53.518 --> 01:11:54.935
I don't know what it is.

1439
01:11:55.728 --> 01:11:58.271
If you found this tape… I mean,
if you're watching this right now,

1440
01:11:58.356 --> 01:12:00.704
then you probably know more
about it than I do.

1441
01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:03.795
Whatever it is,

1442
01:12:03.797 --> 01:12:05.155
it killed my brother,

1443
01:12:06.091 --> 01:12:07.279
Jason Hawkins.

1444
01:12:07.281 --> 01:12:08.851
It killed my best friend, Hudson Platt,

1445
01:12:08.853 --> 01:12:10.366
and Marlena Diamond,

1446
01:12:10.368 --> 01:12:11.680
and many, many others.

1447
01:12:12.286 --> 01:12:15.747
We've crashed here in Central Park
and taken shelter under this bridge.

1448
01:12:15.832 --> 01:12:18.701
The military has begun bombing
the creature and...

1449
01:12:18.703 --> 01:12:20.336
we're caught in the middle.

1450
01:12:21.796 --> 01:12:23.076
Ok. Ready?

1451
01:12:27.927 --> 01:12:28.864
It's ok.

1452
01:12:31.973 --> 01:12:34.391
Beth, look at me.
I don't know what to say.

1453
01:12:34.475 --> 01:12:36.551
Well, just tell them who you are.

1454
01:12:39.272 --> 01:12:41.385
My name is Elizabeth Mclntyre.

1455
01:12:42.788 --> 01:12:44.819
I don't know why this is happening.

1456
01:12:48.114 --> 01:12:50.274
But we're gonna wait here
until this passes.

1457
01:12:53.828 --> 01:12:55.696
Rob, we're gonna wait here.

1458
01:13:05.048 --> 01:13:06.272
Look at me, Beth. Look at me.

1459
01:13:06.274 --> 01:13:07.272
Look at me.

1460
01:13:08.586 --> 01:13:09.926
I love you.
I love you.

1461
01:13:14.515 --> 01:13:17.453
I know what I'm talking about.
Come on, admit it.

1462
01:13:17.455 --> 01:13:19.123
You are going to miss me a little bit, right?

1463
01:13:20.490 --> 01:13:21.738
Yeah, we'll see.

1464
01:13:22.065 --> 01:13:23.482
Ok, yeah, alright.

1465
01:13:23.566 --> 01:13:25.800
Alright, we're almost out of tape.
We got, like, three seconds left.

1466
01:13:26.069 --> 01:13:27.194
What do you wanna say?
What do you wanna say?

1467
01:13:27.278 --> 01:13:28.361
Last thing to the camera.

1468
01:13:29.655 --> 01:13:30.842
I had a good day.
