1
00:01:21.165 --> 00:01:22.457
Oh, yeah!

2
00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:25.293
Okay, you're great.

3
00:01:25.377 --> 00:01:26.419
You got the line?

4
00:01:26.503 --> 00:01:29.547
Yeah.
Come on up, slowpoke.

5
00:01:37.014 --> 00:01:38.181
Help!

6
00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:43.770
You okay? You know,
we're 50 miles from anybody.

7
00:01:43.854 --> 00:01:45.021
Who are you screaming for?

8
00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:46.189
You.

9
00:01:46.815 --> 00:01:48.024
Come on.

10
00:01:50.194 --> 00:01:51.778
Just pull me up!

11
00:01:55.574 --> 00:01:56.699
Rich?

12
00:01:59.244 --> 00:02:00.870
Just pull me up.

13
00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.875
All right, don't be a
dick, Richie. I need a pull.

14
00:02:07.461 --> 00:02:12.173
Rich?

15
00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:17.178
What...

16
00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:44.885
When you plant a
seed into your own kin, you anger God.

17
00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:48.014
<i>...still have not been
able to locate the two missing</i>

18
00:05:48.098 --> 00:05:50.099
<i>Bluefield State
College students.</i>

19
00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:53.769
<i>Richard Stoker and Halley Smith
have been missing since last Monday</i>

20
00:05:53.854 --> 00:05:56.355
<i>after failing to return
from a weekend of rock...</i>

21
00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:10.288
Hey.

22
00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:14.058
Do you have any idea
what's going on up here?

23
00:07:15.644 --> 00:07:17.895
Tractor jackknifed
about five mile up.

24
00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:20.272
Spilled chemicals and
shit all over the road.

25
00:07:20.357 --> 00:07:23.025
Any idea how long
it'll take to clean up?

26
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:24.527
Couple of hours.

27
00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:26.403
Couple of hours?

28
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.030
You in a hurry?

29
00:07:29.658 --> 00:07:31.700
Yeah. I need to get
to Raleigh tonight.

30
00:07:33.078 --> 00:07:35.547
What you ought to do
is get back in your car...

31
00:07:35.747 --> 00:07:38.082
...fix your hair a couple
hundred more times...

32
00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:39.708
Thank you.

33
00:08:04.067 --> 00:08:06.527
Hey, Doris.
This is Chris Flynn.

34
00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.321
I have a 7:00 p.m.
Interview with Mr.Keller.

35
00:08:09.406 --> 00:08:11.824
I'm running about
30 minutes late.

36
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.285
I was
wondering if you could...

37
00:08:14.369 --> 00:08:17.413
Hello? Hello?

38
00:08:18.248 --> 00:08:19.707
I'm not gonna make this.

39
00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:12.551
Excuse me, sir.
Do you have a pay phone?

40
00:09:25.232 --> 00:09:28.025
This one's not working. Do you
have another phone I could use?

41
00:09:28.109 --> 00:09:29.610
Long distance?

42
00:09:31.112 --> 00:09:33.572
What isn't long distance
from here, right?

43
00:09:33.657 --> 00:09:35.741
You cutting wise with me, son?

44
00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:37.402
No, sir, I'm just...

45
00:09:37.811 --> 00:09:40.830
I'm running behind,
and I really need to make a call.

46
00:09:41.831 --> 00:09:44.333
That one there is my only phone.

47
00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:46.919
Right.

48
00:09:48.672 --> 00:09:52.841
Well, the highway's
really jammed up.

49
00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:55.386
Do you know of another
route heading south?

50
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.805
- No.
- No.

51
00:10:04.729 --> 00:10:07.856
Why is this Bear Mountain
Road dotted like this?

52
00:10:08.066 --> 00:10:09.692
- Dirt.
- Dirt road?

53
00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:13.487
Afraid they ain't got
around to paving it yet.

54
00:10:13.571 --> 00:10:18.033
It looks like it runs into the highway
about 15, 20 miles. Is that right?

55
00:10:18.368 --> 00:10:19.868
If you say so.

56
00:10:21.496 --> 00:10:24.123
It could work.
Thank you very much.

57
00:10:24.207 --> 00:10:26.000
You take care, okay?

58
00:10:38.847 --> 00:10:41.557
You're the one that
gonna need to take care.

59
00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:11.939
We just
got nailed, man!

60
00:12:12.524 --> 00:12:13.690
- Jesus Christ!
- Shit!

61
00:12:13.775 --> 00:12:15.567
Goddamn drunk ass hillbilly!

62
00:12:15.652 --> 00:12:17.152
Hey. Hey, you all right?

63
00:12:18.488 --> 00:12:20.489
- I'm so sorry. I just...
- Yeah.

64
00:12:21.241 --> 00:12:22.366
- Jesus.
- I was just coming around the bend.

65
00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:24.035
I didn't even see...
I got distracted.

66
00:12:24.119 --> 00:12:25.494
My God, you could've died!

67
00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:26.745
Are you guys all okay?

68
00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:27.830
Yeah, yeah.
You wanna sit down?

69
00:12:27.914 --> 00:12:29.623
You might be in a state
of shock or something.

70
00:12:29.707 --> 00:12:31.709
What the hell were you doing
driving so goddamn fast for?

71
00:12:31.793 --> 00:12:33.252
All right, all right.

72
00:12:33.336 --> 00:12:34.879
Why was your truck parked
in the middle of the road?

73
00:12:34.963 --> 00:12:36.130
Because we blew out
our tires, asshole!

74
00:12:36.214 --> 00:12:37.757
Hey, look, I'll pay for
whatever damage was done...

75
00:12:37.841 --> 00:12:40.092
You're damn right you're
gonna pay. That's my mom's car.

76
00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:42.803
All right, Frannie.
The man said he'd pay for...

77
00:12:42.887 --> 00:12:45.764
Looks like you killed
my bike here, too.

78
00:12:45.849 --> 00:12:49.101
I'm sorry. I... How did
you blow out your tires?

79
00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:51.270
Someone left some barbed wire
in the middle of the road.

80
00:12:51.354 --> 00:12:53.230
I can't believe someone
just dropped it there.

81
00:12:53.314 --> 00:12:55.274
Nobody dropped anything.

82
00:12:57.193 --> 00:13:00.029
I just found this tied to a tree
back there. Somebody did this.

83
00:13:00.113 --> 00:13:01.947
Southern hospitality
at its finest.

84
00:13:02.031 --> 00:13:03.615
Red neck assholes.

85
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.034
Look, I'm gonna go
try and find a phone.

86
00:13:05.118 --> 00:13:07.370
I think I saw a gas station
like a couple miles back.

87
00:13:07.454 --> 00:13:09.788
I'm gonna come with you.

88
00:13:09.873 --> 00:13:12.458
There is no phone.
I was just there.

89
00:13:12.542 --> 00:13:14.627
Look, why don't we just wait
for someone else to come along?

90
00:13:14.711 --> 00:13:16.045
What, like Speed Racer here?

91
00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:17.588
Look,
I'm not going anywhere.

92
00:13:17.672 --> 00:13:21.258
Okay, you guys go, and, I don't know,
we'll just stay here, Francine, and...

93
00:13:21.342 --> 00:13:22.384
And get high.

94
00:13:22.469 --> 00:13:23.510
Yeah. So what?

95
00:13:23.595 --> 00:13:24.804
Careful.
They don't like stoners.

96
00:13:24.888 --> 00:13:26.305
Who are you
calling a stoner?

97
00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:27.639
Your mom.

98
00:13:27.724 --> 00:13:28.824
Hey, what's your name?

99
00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:31.351
Chris Flynn.

100
00:13:31.978 --> 00:13:33.854
You hurt, Chris Flynn?

101
00:13:34.355 --> 00:13:36.106
No, I'm fine.
Good.

102
00:13:38.485 --> 00:13:39.485
'Cause you're the mule.

103
00:13:39.569 --> 00:13:40.652
Oh, no.

104
00:13:40.737 --> 00:13:44.490
You know, I can carry that. You
just had the whole car accident thing.

105
00:13:44.574 --> 00:13:46.742
Yeah, we'll just
stay here and maybe get hit again.

106
00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:48.202
Are you guys
sure you're cool?

107
00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:49.495
Yeah.

108
00:13:49.579 --> 00:13:51.830
Yeah, we'll be just fine.
Thank you.

109
00:13:51.915 --> 00:13:52.956
Bet you will.

110
00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:55.000
Yeah, smoke it up there, Skippy.

111
00:13:56.211 --> 00:13:57.294
Yeah, have fun.

112
00:13:57.378 --> 00:13:59.713
I don't fucking
believe this.

113
00:14:01.591 --> 00:14:03.884
Your mom's gonna kick your ass.

114
00:14:06.137 --> 00:14:08.222
God, I can not get it out of
my head what just happened.

115
00:14:08.306 --> 00:14:09.390
Are you sure
you're all right? Yeah?

116
00:14:09.474 --> 00:14:11.767
Yeah. I'm fine.

117
00:14:12.352 --> 00:14:13.952
What are you guys
doing out here?

118
00:14:14.896 --> 00:14:18.315
Camping. I don't know.
Actually, we're lost.

119
00:14:18.399 --> 00:14:19.608
You know, a lot of people say,

120
00:14:19.692 --> 00:14:21.360
who have been through similar
traumatic experiences,

121
00:14:21.444 --> 00:14:26.448
that the following moments kind of feel
like you're moving kind of in slow motion.

122
00:14:26.533 --> 00:14:28.367
- Do you feel like that?
- No.

123
00:14:28.451 --> 00:14:32.329
I should tell you that my voice
is fairly low in normal speed.

124
00:14:37.544 --> 00:14:39.378
Pretty good.

125
00:14:45.134 --> 00:14:46.927
Where'd
you get this?

126
00:14:48.137 --> 00:14:51.056
I got it out of my
dad's room, actually.

127
00:14:51.933 --> 00:14:53.600
You can finish it.

128
00:14:58.106 --> 00:15:00.899
I can't believe
they called us stoners.

129
00:15:00.984 --> 00:15:02.317
Dickheads.

130
00:15:04.612 --> 00:15:06.238
Are you sure you know
where we're going?

131
00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:09.032
Yeah. There was
a map at the gas station.

132
00:15:09.409 --> 00:15:13.829
I'm so tired already. I'm
starving, and I'm being eaten by ants.

133
00:15:14.747 --> 00:15:16.540
Are there any on my back?

134
00:15:16.624 --> 00:15:20.210
No, nothing there.
Hey-ho! I call it, squirrel.

135
00:15:20.712 --> 00:15:21.962
Well, you said you
were hungry, Carly.

136
00:15:22.046 --> 00:15:23.672
I don't think it's a squirrel.

137
00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:25.173
It's a mink.

138
00:15:25.675 --> 00:15:26.842
Really?
How do you know?

139
00:15:27.051 --> 00:15:28.844
Probably ran over it.

140
00:15:29.429 --> 00:15:31.639
In medical school, they make
you work on animal cadavers

141
00:15:31.723 --> 00:15:33.348
before you get to
the real thing.

142
00:15:33.433 --> 00:15:34.850
It's a mink.

143
00:15:37.186 --> 00:15:38.604
It's a mink?

144
00:15:39.397 --> 00:15:41.732
I need to be in
Raleigh by 7:00.

145
00:15:41.899 --> 00:15:44.526
Better get
a move on, then.

146
00:15:45.737 --> 00:15:47.947
You know, we should've
just taken her to New York.

147
00:15:48.031 --> 00:15:51.033
No. You know how she
loves this outdoor stuff.

148
00:15:51.618 --> 00:15:52.701
Yeah.

149
00:15:53.828 --> 00:15:56.330
If you ask me, though,
nature sucks.

150
00:15:57.373 --> 00:16:01.376
Well, the next time she gets
dumped, we'll take her to New York.

151
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:07.215
Drop your pants.

152
00:16:08.176 --> 00:16:09.259
What?

153
00:16:09.427 --> 00:16:11.470
When do people
always show up, Evan?

154
00:16:11.554 --> 00:16:13.221
What are we doing?

155
00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:17.476
Consider it an experiment
in probability theory.

156
00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:18.810
Really?

157
00:16:23.274 --> 00:16:24.441
I love you.

158
00:16:24.525 --> 00:16:25.859
I know.

159
00:16:27.111 --> 00:16:30.155
Now get them trousers
off, boy. Don't be a sissy.

160
00:16:30.239 --> 00:16:31.573
All right.

161
00:16:35.078 --> 00:16:38.372
You know, baby, I've been
thinking about this whole wedding thing,

162
00:16:38.456 --> 00:16:40.916
and I think we should
take a trip down to Mexico.

163
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.878
I'm talking about
a long weekend, margaritas,

164
00:16:44.962 --> 00:16:48.173
the two of us on
a beach alone, sunset.

165
00:16:49.425 --> 00:16:52.928
And, you know, I'm talking
about just, just eloping.

166
00:16:53.513 --> 00:16:54.555
You know what I mean?

167
00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:56.848
Okay. Wait a second.

168
00:16:57.183 --> 00:16:59.184
You wanna know what I think?

169
00:16:59.268 --> 00:17:00.602
Yes, please.

170
00:17:00.687 --> 00:17:04.147
I think if you ever want
to get in my pants again...

171
00:17:04.232 --> 00:17:05.399
Affirmative.

172
00:17:05.483 --> 00:17:08.068
...that's the last time
you use the "E" word.

173
00:17:08.152 --> 00:17:10.278
Okay? Okay.

174
00:17:11.072 --> 00:17:13.281
Yeah, it's a disgusting word.

175
00:17:15.284 --> 00:17:17.035
Hey, guys, hold on.

176
00:17:19.664 --> 00:17:21.623
Hey, is anyone up there?

177
00:17:24.043 --> 00:17:25.210
Hello!

178
00:17:26.546 --> 00:17:28.046
There must be people nearby.

179
00:17:28.131 --> 00:17:29.631
Anyone up there?

180
00:17:31.384 --> 00:17:33.385
Somebody had to start it.

181
00:17:34.011 --> 00:17:35.679
Let's keep moving.

182
00:17:38.808 --> 00:17:40.016
Hello?

183
00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.648
Freaky.

184
00:17:52.029 --> 00:17:54.239
Look at this.
It's fucked!

185
00:17:55.742 --> 00:17:58.326
Nothing. Nothing.

186
00:18:02.665 --> 00:18:04.475
Hey, did you find anything to eat?

187
00:18:04.525 --> 00:18:06.626
They took all my Power Bars.

188
00:18:08.337 --> 00:18:11.506
No. No. Sorry.

189
00:18:17.138 --> 00:18:20.682
Damn it. Scott and Carly
took all our frigging sunscreen.

190
00:18:23.227 --> 00:18:25.353
Does he have any good CDs?

191
00:18:28.691 --> 00:18:30.442
Definitely not.

192
00:18:36.282 --> 00:18:38.826
You know, I think this guy
must be some kind of doctor.

193
00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:42.460
Maybe we could get him to write us
some prescriptions when he gets back.

194
00:18:43.539 --> 00:18:45.499
He doesn't have any
smokes, either.

195
00:18:45.583 --> 00:18:46.958
Almost out.

196
00:18:56.052 --> 00:18:57.177
Evan?

197
00:19:09.857 --> 00:19:12.025
Evan? Where are you?

198
00:19:13.945 --> 00:19:15.487
Hey, baby, what are you doing?

199
00:19:15.571 --> 00:19:18.573
I'm just am using myself.

200
00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:23.370
You getting anything
there, chatty?

201
00:19:23.454 --> 00:19:25.705
No, nothing.
I'm gonna miss this thing.

202
00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:27.499
Why didn't you just fly?

203
00:19:27.583 --> 00:19:29.835
I put all of my money
into that car back there.

204
00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:32.546
Okay, forget eloping,
but there is an idea

205
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:34.673
I think we should discuss
about the band for our wedding.

206
00:19:34.757 --> 00:19:39.719
I think we should hire, you know, a Frank
Sinatra-type lead singer for the band

207
00:19:39.804 --> 00:19:42.180
as opposed to a James
Brown-type lead singer,

208
00:19:42.265 --> 00:19:45.058
because, you know, really, let's be
honest, there's only one James Brown,

209
00:19:45.142 --> 00:19:48.979
and, you know, a faux James
Brown is really quite intolerable.

210
00:19:52.984 --> 00:19:55.735
Evan? Where are you?

211
00:19:56.904 --> 00:19:58.905
You pissing or something?

212
00:20:05.454 --> 00:20:06.538
Evan?

213
00:20:37.695 --> 00:20:41.239
You know, plus he'd be grinding his
hips, and my grand mother would be,

214
00:20:41.324 --> 00:20:44.075
yes, revolted
but also strangely fascinated

215
00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:47.704
in a completely
disturbing way and...

216
00:20:51.542 --> 00:20:52.667
Baby?

217
00:20:56.088 --> 00:20:58.214
Carly, I was kidding.

218
00:20:58.966 --> 00:21:00.133
Carly?

219
00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:07.015
Evan?

220
00:21:34.543 --> 00:21:37.212
Sweetheart?
Hey, guys, hold up!

221
00:21:38.506 --> 00:21:41.132
Guys, hold up for
a second, all right?

222
00:21:43.177 --> 00:21:45.553
Baby, seriously,
this isn't funny.

223
00:21:47.723 --> 00:21:49.683
Jesus. God! Baby!

224
00:21:53.729 --> 00:21:55.814
Oh! I'm so sorry.

225
00:21:55.898 --> 00:21:58.692
I could've killed you, woman.
I'm extremely dangerous.

226
00:21:58.776 --> 00:22:01.403
You wanna know why
I love you so much?

227
00:22:01.612 --> 00:22:03.446
Because you're so
fun to play with.

228
00:22:03.531 --> 00:22:05.991
Is that why you love me?

229
00:22:06.075 --> 00:22:08.068
- That really scared me, baby.
- I'm sorry.

230
00:22:08.118 --> 00:22:10.328
That really scared me.
Would you not do that?

231
00:22:10.413 --> 00:22:12.497
Hello!

232
00:22:15.626 --> 00:22:16.960
Hello!

233
00:22:21.298 --> 00:22:24.342
There's nothing like
stating the obvious, huh?

234
00:22:26.762 --> 00:22:28.763
Hey, baby, look at this.

235
00:22:30.224 --> 00:22:31.516
Hey, Carly, I think this
would be a good time

236
00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.018
for you to confront
your fear of heights!

237
00:22:33.102 --> 00:22:34.352
Don't!

238
00:22:34.437 --> 00:22:36.396
Okay, that is not funny.

239
00:22:36.814 --> 00:22:38.690
Look who's scared now.

240
00:22:43.362 --> 00:22:44.988
- Sorry.
- Whatever.

241
00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:49.951
Just get me to a motel room,
run me a very hot bath,

242
00:22:50.036 --> 00:22:53.621
and be prepared to provide
me with a lot of orgasms.

243
00:22:55.124 --> 00:22:56.666
I think they need to be alone.

244
00:22:57.168 --> 00:22:59.711
What do you expect?
They just got engaged.

245
00:22:59.795 --> 00:23:02.464
They're happy.
It's a hard thing to find.

246
00:23:02.548 --> 00:23:03.631
Yeah.

247
00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.052
- Got it?
- Limber tongue. Got it.

248
00:23:07.136 --> 00:23:08.636
You're stupid.

249
00:23:19.315 --> 00:23:21.483
Maybe we shouldn't
have left Francine and Evan.

250
00:23:21.567 --> 00:23:23.610
Don't worry.
They're fine.

251
00:23:24.445 --> 00:23:26.196
- You guys okay?
- Super.

252
00:23:31.786 --> 00:23:33.787
Well, wait, guys.
This road isn't on here.

253
00:23:33.871 --> 00:23:36.915
That's because you don't
have the Red neck World Atlas.

254
00:23:39.126 --> 00:23:40.877
I think we've just
been saved, kids.

255
00:23:41.003 --> 00:23:42.712
Can I get a...

256
00:23:52.223 --> 00:23:53.848
Make this quick.

257
00:23:55.142 --> 00:23:57.102
Actually, maybe
we should keep walking.

258
00:23:57.186 --> 00:24:00.188
What? The next house is
gonna have a white picket fence?

259
00:24:00.272 --> 00:24:02.524
Yeah, if there is a next house.

260
00:24:05.736 --> 00:24:07.112
- Hey.
- What?

261
00:24:25.756 --> 00:24:26.923
Hello?

262
00:24:28.217 --> 00:24:30.343
All right, this isn't right.

263
00:24:31.387 --> 00:24:32.554
Hello?

264
00:24:38.894 --> 00:24:40.687
Hello? Anybody home?

265
00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:47.026
Baby, could you...

266
00:24:47.528 --> 00:24:49.737
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

267
00:24:50.322 --> 00:24:51.601
I was gonna see if they had a phone.

268
00:24:51.685 --> 00:24:53.075
You guys can wait out here if you want.

269
00:24:53.159 --> 00:24:55.327
You can't just go barging
into someone's house like that.

270
00:24:55.411 --> 00:24:57.412
Yeah because, you know,
I'm just thinking,

271
00:24:57.496 --> 00:25:00.123
West Virginia, trespassing,
not a great combination.

272
00:25:00.207 --> 00:25:01.958
Look, I need to pee.

273
00:25:03.419 --> 00:25:07.380
Well, I need to remind you of a
little movie called Deliverance.

274
00:25:09.592 --> 00:25:13.428
Guys, we got two wrecked cars.
I mean, we really need a phone.

275
00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:25.773
Hello?

276
00:25:27.109 --> 00:25:28.276
Carly.

277
00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:35.617
Hello?

278
00:25:52.218 --> 00:25:53.218
What the fuck?

279
00:25:53.302 --> 00:25:56.554
Let's just do what
we gotta do and get out of here.

280
00:25:59.892 --> 00:26:02.685
Hey, I am not
sensing a phone here.

281
00:26:03.479 --> 00:26:04.646
Hello!

282
00:26:06.523 --> 00:26:08.149
Okay, who lives here?

283
00:26:08.234 --> 00:26:11.402
I don't know, but can
you help me find a bathroom?

284
00:26:11.487 --> 00:26:13.187
Baby, I think this
is the bathroom.

285
00:26:15.449 --> 00:26:18.993
Fuck.

286
00:26:20.663 --> 00:26:22.872
Oh, my God.
Look at this place.

287
00:26:24.667 --> 00:26:26.168
Seriously, guys,
I think we should go.

288
00:26:26.252 --> 00:26:28.253
Okay, just help me find
the bathroom. Then we'll go.

289
00:26:28.337 --> 00:26:30.547
Baby, what if this place
belongs to some kind of cult?

290
00:26:30.631 --> 00:26:33.216
Actually, I reading Newsweek
how economically-depressed places

291
00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:36.970
are like breeding grounds for all
kinds of apocalyptic visionaries.

292
00:26:37.054 --> 00:26:38.555
Order of the Solar Temple,
Jom Bola,

293
00:26:38.639 --> 00:26:40.515
Church of the Lamb of God,
the Chijon Family.

294
00:26:40.599 --> 00:26:43.049
- Remember them? Not nice people.
- Hey, brainiac!

295
00:26:46.355 --> 00:26:48.398
All right. Maybe that door.

296
00:26:58.867 --> 00:26:59.993
- Jesus Christ!
- You're fine.

297
00:27:00.077 --> 00:27:01.995
- You okay?
- It's just a paddle.

298
00:27:02.079 --> 00:27:03.329
It's all right.

299
00:27:12.715 --> 00:27:14.674
God, look at this place.

300
00:27:15.426 --> 00:27:18.261
Yeah. It's like the
garage sale from hell.

301
00:27:18.429 --> 00:27:19.595
Jesus.

302
00:27:22.266 --> 00:27:24.100
Can you believe this?

303
00:27:29.148 --> 00:27:32.066
Jesus, these guys
are ripping people off.

304
00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:40.909
Chris.

305
00:27:41.452 --> 00:27:43.077
I think we should leave.

306
00:27:46.582 --> 00:27:48.458
This is kind of
creepy, actually.

307
00:27:53.255 --> 00:27:54.839
- Yeah, this is it.
- Okay. Be quick.

308
00:27:54.923 --> 00:27:56.090
Okay.

309
00:27:56.175 --> 00:27:57.342
All right? Two minutes.

310
00:27:57.426 --> 00:27:59.385
All right? I'll be here.

311
00:29:52.708 --> 00:29:54.792
Guys, guys,
check this out.

312
00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:57.628
Oh, no.

313
00:30:01.592 --> 00:30:03.509
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Scott. Scott!

314
00:30:05.012 --> 00:30:06.971
Scott, we have to go now!

315
00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:10.933
- Jess! Jessie!
- Jess!

316
00:30:11.018 --> 00:30:11.976
Hey!
Guys, what is it?

317
00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:13.353
We need to get back
to your friends.

318
00:30:13.437 --> 00:30:15.188
- What about a phone?
- There is no phone.

319
00:30:15.272 --> 00:30:16.272
Shit!

320
00:30:19.902 --> 00:30:21.569
There's a back door.
I saw a back door. Come on.

321
00:30:21.653 --> 00:30:23.237
- Go!
- Go, go!

322
00:30:25.324 --> 00:30:27.658
Okay, hurry. Shit!

323
00:30:27.743 --> 00:30:28.868
Shit! No!

324
00:30:30.078 --> 00:30:34.248
Scott! Scott! It's not
gonna budge! Come on!

325
00:36:47.998 --> 00:37:04.722
Go.

326
00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:23.198
Go! Go!

327
00:37:24.159 --> 00:37:26.076
- Go! Go!
- Go, baby! Go! Go!

328
00:37:26.161 --> 00:37:27.661
Go, you guys! Run!

329
00:37:30.165 --> 00:37:31.415
Go quickly. Come on.

330
00:37:31.499 --> 00:37:32.666
Come on! Come on!

331
00:37:40.425 --> 00:37:42.885
- Where are they going?
- I don't know.

332
00:37:43.845 --> 00:37:46.555
Jesus, did that
really just happen?

333
00:37:46.848 --> 00:37:48.933
Do you think Evan's okay?

334
00:37:52.062 --> 00:37:53.062
Baby.

335
00:37:53.146 --> 00:37:54.855
I can't. I can't.

336
00:37:55.690 --> 00:37:57.566
Carly, come on! Get up!

337
00:37:57.651 --> 00:37:59.443
You didn't see what
they did to Francine.

338
00:37:59.527 --> 00:38:01.737
You didn't see what we saw!

339
00:38:01.821 --> 00:38:03.989
Carly! Carly! Carly!
Sweet pea!

340
00:38:04.074 --> 00:38:06.325
Look at me. We are gonna
get out of this, I swear to you.

341
00:38:06.409 --> 00:38:09.662
We are. Okay? We're gonna find
a road. We're gonna get to a town.

342
00:38:09.746 --> 00:38:13.791
And we're going home. We're
gonna get married. All right?

343
00:38:14.918 --> 00:38:17.628
And we are never
going into the woods again.

344
00:38:19.464 --> 00:38:21.382
- All right?
- We gotta go.

345
00:38:21.591 --> 00:38:24.218
Come on. This way!
Let's go! Come on!

346
00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:40.567
What is this?

347
00:38:51.496 --> 00:38:52.663
Jesus.

348
00:38:55.375 --> 00:38:57.001
All these people.

349
00:38:59.421 --> 00:39:02.965
Baby. Fuck.

350
00:39:08.972 --> 00:39:11.140
How can they do this?
I don't understand.

351
00:39:11.224 --> 00:39:12.600
How'd they get away with this?

352
00:39:12.684 --> 00:39:14.852
Oh, my God.
All these people.

353
00:39:14.936 --> 00:39:18.605
Maybe one of
them still runs. Look for keys.

354
00:39:18.690 --> 00:39:20.607
None of these
cars are gonna run.

355
00:39:21.276 --> 00:39:24.820
Come on. Look at them.
Oh, fuck.

356
00:39:32.287 --> 00:39:33.829
Get down! Get down!

357
00:39:33.913 --> 00:39:35.456
- Oh, shit.
- What?

358
00:40:11.034 --> 00:40:12.576
What do we do?

359
00:40:13.078 --> 00:40:14.995
- They left their truck running.
- So?

360
00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:16.246
We gotta take it.

361
00:40:16.331 --> 00:40:17.873
How are we
supposed to do that?

362
00:40:17.957 --> 00:40:19.583
One of us leads them
in the wrong direction

363
00:40:19.667 --> 00:40:22.817
and the rest commandeer the
truck so they'll run for the runner.

364
00:40:26.174 --> 00:40:28.259
- It's a classic military move.
- Who goes?

365
00:40:28.309 --> 00:40:29.284
Me.

366
00:40:29.344 --> 00:40:33.013
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

367
00:40:34.015 --> 00:40:35.349
Over here!

368
00:40:45.193 --> 00:40:48.862
Oh, shit.
Oh, God. Oh, God.

369
00:40:51.032 --> 00:40:52.199
Go!

370
00:40:53.034 --> 00:40:56.120
Listen, help him get to
the truck. I'll meet you there.

371
00:40:56.204 --> 00:40:57.704
- I love you.
- I love you.

372
00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:01.875
Fuckers!
Asshole motherfuckers!

373
00:41:02.085 --> 00:41:03.377
Assholes!

374
00:41:06.506 --> 00:41:07.881
He's okay.

375
00:41:20.061 --> 00:41:21.270
Come on.

376
00:41:29.737 --> 00:41:31.738
Here, here. You're okay.

377
00:41:35.285 --> 00:41:38.036
Go ahead. Go,
go, go. Go to the truck.

378
00:41:41.916 --> 00:41:43.667
Go. Come on. We gotta go.

379
00:41:43.751 --> 00:41:44.752
- We gotta go. Come on!
- I can't!

380
00:41:44.836 --> 00:41:46.503
- I can't!
- Come on!

381
00:41:46.754 --> 00:41:48.422
Carly, get in!

382
00:42:15.033 --> 00:42:17.868
We gotta find Scott!
We have to find Scott!

383
00:42:29.172 --> 00:42:31.131
Where is he?
Where is he?

384
00:42:34.928 --> 00:42:37.596
There he is! There he is!
There he is! Scott!

385
00:42:38.806 --> 00:42:42.059
Run, Scott!
We're over here! Scott!

386
00:42:42.727 --> 00:42:44.895
Scott! Come on!
Scott, let's go!

387
00:42:44.979 --> 00:42:46.396
Come on!

388
00:42:46.481 --> 00:42:47.481
Come on!

389
00:42:49.484 --> 00:42:51.526
Come on, Scott! Scott!

390
00:42:51.611 --> 00:42:52.694
Let's go!

391
00:42:52.779 --> 00:42:54.279
Scott, come on!
Come on, Scott!

392
00:42:55.073 --> 00:42:57.658
Come on, Scott!
Scott! Scott! What are you doing?

393
00:42:58.076 --> 00:43:00.452
Scott, what's wrong? Scott!
Scott!

394
00:43:00.954 --> 00:43:02.496
Scott! No!

395
00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:05.582
No!

396
00:43:05.667 --> 00:43:09.169
Let go of me!
Let me go!

397
00:43:10.255 --> 00:43:11.421
Scott!

398
00:43:13.633 --> 00:43:14.675
No!

399
00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:20.639
Drive! Drive!

400
00:43:21.849 --> 00:43:23.392
- No!
- Drive!

401
00:43:31.192 --> 00:43:32.609
Oh, God!

402
00:43:34.612 --> 00:43:36.238
What's happening?

403
00:44:02.015 --> 00:44:04.057
Oh, God,
what's happening?

404
00:44:09.063 --> 00:44:12.733
Jess, please, can
we go back? Please.

405
00:44:14.068 --> 00:44:17.404
Carly, we have to
keep going. Okay?

406
00:44:23.995 --> 00:44:25.203
Scott.

407
00:44:43.222 --> 00:44:45.515
Are you sure this
is the road from that map?

408
00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:47.851
It's gotta
go somewhere.

409
00:44:47.977 --> 00:44:50.437
This better get us out of here.

410
00:44:56.277 --> 00:44:57.361
Shit.

411
00:45:03.034 --> 00:45:04.785
Shit.
Come on.

412
00:45:08.206 --> 00:45:09.623
Back it up.

413
00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:13.877
Come on!

414
00:45:13.961 --> 00:45:16.171
It's not gonna go any farther.
Come on. Let's get out.

415
00:45:16.255 --> 00:45:17.798
Damn it.

416
00:45:21.469 --> 00:45:23.012
We gotta find out where we are.

417
00:45:23.096 --> 00:45:24.513
The highest ridge
is up there. Come on.

418
00:45:24.597 --> 00:45:27.391
What's the point? They're
gonna find us anyway.

419
00:45:27.475 --> 00:45:28.559
Come on.
Let's go, Carly.

420
00:45:28.643 --> 00:45:31.645
No. If he's going, I'm not.
He got us into this.

421
00:45:31.729 --> 00:45:35.315
Carly, look at me, okay?
Scott died protecting us.

422
00:45:35.817 --> 00:45:39.236
We need to keep ourselves
alive, or it was for nothing. Okay?

423
00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:41.238
We're all in this
together, Carl.

424
00:45:41.322 --> 00:45:42.531
Come on.

425
00:45:43.282 --> 00:45:44.866
I want him back.

426
00:45:50.581 --> 00:45:52.124
I know, I know.

427
00:45:55.169 --> 00:45:56.962
Carl, look at me.
Okay? Look.

428
00:45:57.046 --> 00:45:59.465
We're gonna stay alive.
We're gonna get out of this.

429
00:45:59.549 --> 00:46:01.258
We're gonna get out of these
woods, find the police,

430
00:46:01.342 --> 00:46:04.928
and we're gonna make sure those
motherfucks are punished for this. Okay?

431
00:46:07.515 --> 00:46:08.682
Carly.

432
00:46:10.935 --> 00:46:13.186
Come on, Carly.
You can do it.

433
00:46:15.022 --> 00:46:17.441
It's gonna get dark soon.
Come on.

434
00:46:20.945 --> 00:46:22.696
We need to find that road quick.

435
00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:23.989
I know.

436
00:46:54.896 --> 00:46:56.938
Just a
little bit farther.

437
00:47:02.069 --> 00:47:03.403
Chris!

438
00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:07.240
It's a bear trap.

439
00:47:44.028 --> 00:47:45.153
What's up?

440
00:47:45.238 --> 00:47:46.446
I gotta rest.

441
00:47:56.582 --> 00:47:57.916
Hey, guys.

442
00:47:58.834 --> 00:47:59.960
Look.

443
00:48:02.255 --> 00:48:03.630
Oh, my God.

444
00:48:04.382 --> 00:48:05.966
It's a watchtower.

445
00:48:09.804 --> 00:48:12.389
Hello!
Is anyone up there?

446
00:48:15.851 --> 00:48:16.852
I don't think
anyone's up there.

447
00:48:16.936 --> 00:48:18.019
Doesn't matter.

448
00:48:18.104 --> 00:48:21.731
It may have a phone or a radio.
Maybe we can see the road.

449
00:48:21.941 --> 00:48:23.191
You okay?

450
00:48:28.823 --> 00:48:30.031
Come on.

451
00:49:28.382 --> 00:49:30.634
Guys, I don't see any
roads or towns out there.

452
00:49:30.718 --> 00:49:33.887
Let's not stand by the window.
They might see us.

453
00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:43.605
- Hey.
- We're all gonna die.

454
00:49:46.442 --> 00:49:49.092
Carly, I need you to come
help me look around, please.

455
00:50:03.417 --> 00:50:04.751
Hey, Chris.

456
00:50:25.815 --> 00:50:28.066
- Jess.
- Thanks.

457
00:51:07.148 --> 00:51:09.149
Oh, my God. It's a radio.

458
00:51:14.155 --> 00:51:15.947
Thing
looks prehistoric.

459
00:51:16.031 --> 00:51:17.490
Do you know how to use this?

460
00:51:17.575 --> 00:51:19.033
Let me try.

461
00:51:19.577 --> 00:51:21.745
- It could still work.
- Don't move anything.

462
00:51:21.829 --> 00:51:24.831
Just keep it on the
frequency they had it on.

463
00:51:24.915 --> 00:51:26.200
Can anybody hear me?

464
00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:28.711
We have an emergency.
Can anybody hear me?

465
00:51:29.170 --> 00:51:30.670
Say "mayday."

466
00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:34.674
Look, we have a huge emergency.
Please, does anybody hear me?

467
00:51:35.009 --> 00:51:37.343
Someone is injured.
We need help.

468
00:51:37.553 --> 00:51:38.762
Hello.

469
00:51:38.971 --> 00:51:41.973
Please, is anybody out there
that can hear me? Hello.

470
00:51:42.850 --> 00:51:43.892
No.

471
00:51:46.854 --> 00:51:48.980
Get down.
Cover the light.

472
00:52:06.415 --> 00:52:08.541
I think they're passing us.

473
00:52:19.595 --> 00:52:21.471
<i>This is Ranger
Base Emergency. Do you copy?</i>

474
00:52:21.555 --> 00:52:23.181
<i>What is your position? Over.</i>

475
00:52:25.893 --> 00:52:28.102
<i>Do you copy?
What is your position? Over.</i>

476
00:52:28.229 --> 00:52:30.939
I don't know
my position. Just help us.

477
00:52:32.149 --> 00:52:35.944
<i>I need another copy of that. I repeat,
what is your position?</i>

478
00:52:36.028 --> 00:52:37.570
They're coming.

479
00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:44.870
We don't know our position.
We're in a watchtower.

480
00:52:44.954 --> 00:52:47.413
We must be north of
Bear Mountain Road.

481
00:52:47.498 --> 00:52:49.374
Someone is trying
to kill us! Please!

482
00:52:49.458 --> 00:52:52.210
They've murdered our friends.
They're after us right now.

483
00:52:52.294 --> 00:52:53.837
<i>I'm having
some trouble hearing you.</i>

484
00:52:53.921 --> 00:52:56.006
<i>If you're in the tower,
stay up there. Do you copy?</i>

485
00:52:56.090 --> 00:52:58.759
Yes, yes, we copy! Just hurry,
please! This is an emergency!

486
00:52:58.843 --> 00:53:00.010
Help me move this.
Come on! Come on!

487
00:53:00.094 --> 00:53:01.261
<i>We'll come to you.
Do you copy?</i>

488
00:53:01.345 --> 00:53:04.097
They're after us!
Someone's been shot!

489
00:53:04.181 --> 00:53:07.684
Our friends have been killed,
and we need help! Please!

490
00:53:07.768 --> 00:53:08.935
Fuck!

491
00:53:35.546 --> 00:53:37.297
What are they doing?

492
00:53:37.631 --> 00:53:39.132
I don't know.

493
00:53:43.137 --> 00:53:45.221
I think they're going down.

494
00:53:46.307 --> 00:53:47.807
Jess.

495
00:54:03.073 --> 00:54:07.201
Hello? Hello? Is anybody
there? Can you hear us? Hello?

496
00:54:37.816 --> 00:54:40.193
Jesus,
what are they doing?

497
00:54:40.819 --> 00:54:41.903
We're on fire.

498
00:54:41.987 --> 00:54:44.280
They're trying to burn us out.

499
00:54:46.825 --> 00:54:48.201
Oh, my God.

500
00:54:59.546 --> 00:55:00.880
Carly!

501
00:55:01.757 --> 00:55:02.757
Come here.

502
00:55:02.841 --> 00:55:04.926
Let go of me! Let go!

503
00:55:05.094 --> 00:55:07.845
I'd rather jump
than burn to death!

504
00:55:10.683 --> 00:55:12.183
Calm down.

505
00:55:12.267 --> 00:55:13.726
You're right.

506
00:55:13.811 --> 00:55:15.603
- What?
- She's right.

507
00:55:15.729 --> 00:55:17.647
We have to jump. Those
branches are only a few feet down.

508
00:55:17.731 --> 00:55:19.065
That's more like 20 feet.

509
00:55:19.149 --> 00:55:20.233
Look, Jessie, I don't
want to burn to death,

510
00:55:20.317 --> 00:55:21.651
and I don't want to be
chopped up into pieces.

511
00:55:21.735 --> 00:55:23.653
We can do this.
I'll go first.

512
00:55:25.364 --> 00:55:27.323
Chris. Hey.

513
00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:17.540
Chris! Chris!

514
00:56:18.751 --> 00:56:20.793
Help! Chris.

515
00:56:47.738 --> 00:56:48.738
You okay?

516
00:56:48.822 --> 00:56:50.281
Do you think they saw us?

517
00:56:50.991 --> 00:56:52.450
I don't know.

518
00:57:00.167 --> 00:57:02.293
We gotta move. Come on.

519
00:57:02.377 --> 00:57:04.170
Shit. Shit.

520
00:57:22.689 --> 00:57:24.190
Carly, come on.

521
00:58:30.424 --> 00:58:33.634
I can do this. I can
do this. I can do this.

522
00:58:34.094 --> 00:58:36.345
I can... I can do this.

523
00:59:04.708 --> 00:59:06.792
Come on. Come on.

524
00:59:11.924 --> 00:59:13.299
All right.

525
00:59:27.356 --> 00:59:28.397
He's coming.

526
00:59:28.482 --> 00:59:30.775
I know. I have a plan.
Come on.

527
00:59:38.825 --> 00:59:40.534
Jessie, this way.

528
01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:06.811
- Can you hold this?
- Why?

529
01:00:07.062 --> 01:00:09.648
'Cause we're gonna knock
this fucker out of the tree.

530
01:00:09.698 --> 01:00:11.057
Can you hold it?

531
01:00:11.608 --> 01:00:12.942
Yeah.

532
01:00:13.026 --> 01:00:15.176
Alright. Don't let go
until I say so. Okay?

533
01:00:15.862 --> 01:00:17.071
Where are you going?

534
01:00:17.155 --> 01:00:18.615
I'm gonna make sure
he comes this way.

535
01:00:18.699 --> 01:00:20.908
No. You can't move
as quick as I can.

536
01:00:20.993 --> 01:00:22.785
Jessie. Jessie.

537
01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:46.392
I'm right here!
Come and get me!

538
01:00:51.398 --> 01:00:52.898
Where are you?

539
01:00:56.403 --> 01:00:57.737
Here I am!

540
01:01:54.836 --> 01:01:55.961
Hey!

541
01:03:36.396 --> 01:03:38.397
Sorry about your friends.

542
01:03:41.234 --> 01:03:45.154
Last Friday I came home, and
there's a message on my machine

543
01:03:46.198 --> 01:03:52.286
from my boyfriend, who says that
we shouldn't be together anymore.

544
01:03:55.582 --> 01:03:59.919
With in 20 minutes
of me telling Carly,

545
01:04:02.547 --> 01:04:07.218
she had Scott and
Evan and Francine

546
01:04:07.302 --> 01:04:10.596
all blowing off work this
week to take me out here.

547
01:04:12.098 --> 01:04:14.934
That's just the kind
of friends they were.

548
01:04:17.354 --> 01:04:19.146
And now they're dead.

549
01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:30.491
It's not your fault.

550
01:04:32.619 --> 01:04:33.869
It's not.

551
01:05:00.981 --> 01:05:02.481
They're here.

552
01:05:10.282 --> 01:05:13.367
No, they're not.
You were dreaming.

553
01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:16.328
I wish.

554
01:06:02.250 --> 01:06:04.293
- How's your leg?
- It hurts.

555
01:06:04.377 --> 01:06:07.422
Which is good. If it didn't hurt...

556
01:06:07.547 --> 01:06:08.506
Road.

557
01:06:08.556 --> 01:06:10.049
- What?
- Road! Look.

558
01:06:12.052 --> 01:06:13.177
We gotta get down there.

559
01:06:13.261 --> 01:06:15.554
Take that slope right there.

560
01:06:18.683 --> 01:06:20.392
I can't believe it.

561
01:06:21.895 --> 01:06:23.271
How are we gonna get you down?

562
01:06:23.355 --> 01:06:25.064
I'll get down...

563
01:06:26.483 --> 01:06:27.775
- Chris!
- Go!

564
01:06:29.069 --> 01:06:30.778
Chris! No! Chris! No!

565
01:06:30.862 --> 01:06:33.155
Chris! Chris!

566
01:06:34.574 --> 01:06:39.370
Chris! Chris!
Get off of me!

567
01:06:42.791 --> 01:06:44.124
Jessie!

568
01:06:44.417 --> 01:06:45.584
Jessie!

569
01:06:55.679 --> 01:06:56.771
Hey, stop!

570
01:06:57.622 --> 01:06:58.889
Oh, thank God.

571
01:06:59.349 --> 01:07:00.933
Are you crazy?

572
01:07:01.768 --> 01:07:03.019
- They took her. Come on. We gotta...
- Calm down.

573
01:07:03.103 --> 01:07:04.687
- Just calm down.
- We gotta move.

574
01:07:04.771 --> 01:07:06.639
Are you one of them folks who
called me from the fire tower?

575
01:07:06.689 --> 01:07:08.249
- I've been looking all over for you.
- Will you shut up and listen?

576
01:07:08.299 --> 01:07:10.651
- People are dead.
- Dead? What people?

577
01:09:28.790 --> 01:09:29.832
No!

578
01:09:34.629 --> 01:09:35.671
No.

579
01:09:42.053 --> 01:09:48.141
Help me, please.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

580
01:09:48.434 --> 01:09:52.563
I'm sorry. Yeah?
Can you help me?

581
01:09:53.398 --> 01:09:54.940
Please help me.

582
01:09:56.067 --> 01:09:57.276
No!

583
01:09:59.404 --> 01:10:00.487
No!

584
01:11:20.818 --> 01:11:22.569
Somebody, help me!

585
01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:28.367
No!

586
01:11:51.641 --> 01:11:52.891
Help me.

587
01:12:49.782 --> 01:12:50.783
You're okay. Come on.

588
01:12:50.867 --> 01:12:54.745
Just stay with me. You're
all right. Come on. It's okay.

589
01:12:55.079 --> 01:12:57.539
Keep looking at me.
All right? You're okay.

590
01:12:57.623 --> 01:12:59.041
Thank you.

591
01:12:59.675 --> 01:13:00.576
Everything's okay.

592
01:13:05.673 --> 01:13:06.882
Chris!

593
01:14:01.479 --> 01:14:02.813
Chris!

594
01:14:56.951 --> 01:14:58.285
Chris.

595
01:15:09.630 --> 01:15:11.173
Get the fuck off of me!

596
01:15:25.313 --> 01:15:26.813
Shoot them.

597
01:15:27.523 --> 01:15:29.816
I only got one shot left.

598
01:15:37.033 --> 01:15:41.703
Come on, you motherfuckers.
Just die.
