1
00:01:13.407 --> 00:01:15.284
Bye-bye.

2
00:01:37.973 --> 00:01:40.517
Stitch, why are you doing this?

3
00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.439
Please stop.

4
00:01:56.575 --> 00:01:58.619
Stop it, Stitch. Don't...

5
00:02:01.455 --> 00:02:03.957
No. Stitch.

6
00:02:04.082 --> 00:02:07.211
Wake up.

7
00:02:07.336 --> 00:02:09.713
Wake up, Stitch. Wake up.

8
00:02:09.838 --> 00:02:12.174
Stitch, wake up.

9
00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.844
It's all right. Don't worry.

10
00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:19.056
You were just having
another nightmare.

11
00:02:19.181 --> 00:02:21.225
Seems like a bad one.

12
00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:25.020
You know what this means,
don't you?

13
00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:28.774
Very interesting.

14
00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:31.235
Why don't you tell me
what happened next?

15
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.403
Well...

16
00:02:35.906 --> 00:02:37.199
I see.

17
00:02:37.324 --> 00:02:38.325
Then...

18
00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:40.285
And then...

19
00:02:41.453 --> 00:02:42.454
And then...

20
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.708
That's it. No more.

21
00:02:46.834 --> 00:02:51.964
It's my professional opinion
that you're afraid of turning bad again.

22
00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:54.424
We need to test your goodness level.

23
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.096
For example, someone bad would
let this Elvis                 Blue Hawaii                 lamp,

24
00:02:59.221 --> 00:03:03.475
circa 1971,
smash to pieces against that wall.

25
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:08.981
Or let my favourite book,
Plastic Surgeries Gone Wrong,

26
00:03:09.106 --> 00:03:11.650
drop out this window
to be lost forever.

27
00:03:15.696 --> 00:03:20.492
Or let his family member
fall to her painful, crushing death.

28
00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:22.870
No.

29
00:03:22.995 --> 00:03:26.456
See?
Look at all the good things you did.

30
00:03:26.582 --> 00:03:30.836
My prognosis?
Your goodness level is extra high.

31
00:03:30.961 --> 00:03:33.005
Nothing to worry about.

32
00:03:35.424 --> 00:03:38.302
Lilo. Stitch.
You're gonna be late for hula class.

33
00:03:38.427 --> 00:03:39.887
Except that.

34
00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:45.767
Stitch.

35
00:03:47.102 --> 00:03:48.937
Hurry up, you two.

36
00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:52.733
Can you guys help me today?
It's family night.

37
00:03:52.858 --> 00:03:55.319
- I want the house clean.
- Not me.

38
00:03:55.444 --> 00:03:58.864
I have very important project
I've been working on.

39
00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.908
No more crop circles.

40
00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:04.453
All the other aliens get to make them.

41
00:04:04.578 --> 00:04:08.624
- What about you?
- I have a full day of Earth research.

42
00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:11.335
Watching talk shows
and reading magazines?

43
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.295
Yeah, it takes it out of ya.

44
00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.631
Can we take the hovercraft? Please?

45
00:04:15.756 --> 00:04:17.632
It's too dangerous.

46
00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:21.595
- Besides, someone may see you.
- Please?

47
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.849
All right, you can take it
if you can find it.

48
00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:30.062
I hid it so good this time,
they're never...

49
00:04:30.187 --> 00:04:32.147
Thanks, Nani.

50
00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:36.235
I gotta find
a better hiding place for that thing.

51
00:04:49.248 --> 00:04:50.249
Sorry.

52
00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:32.833
Girls, I have very exciting news.

53
00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.419
This week is our May Day...

54
00:05:35.544 --> 00:05:38.213
Sorry I'm late.
But wait till you see this.

55
00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:40.507
I got my                 uliuli                 technique down.

56
00:05:40.632 --> 00:05:42.259
Lilo...

57
00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:50.100
Lilo?

58
00:05:52.311 --> 00:05:54.479
Lilo, we're not doing that today.

59
00:05:54.605 --> 00:05:56.648
We're not doing that today.

60
00:06:03.864 --> 00:06:05.657
Kumu has an announcement.

61
00:06:05.782 --> 00:06:10.662
In three days
is our town's May Day celebration.

62
00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:12.706
And here's the best part.

63
00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:15.000
There will be a hula competition.

64
00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:18.045
Each of you
will create an original hula.

65
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:22.716
The one that best expresses
the                 aloha                 spirit will lead our hulau

66
00:06:22.841 --> 00:06:25.844
- as the winning dance.
- You.

67
00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:28.931
- Are there any questions?
- Kumu, I have one.

68
00:06:29.056 --> 00:06:32.935
Will people who are late to class
be allowed to participate?

69
00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.648
Mertle, I think in the spirit of aloha
we should be tolerant of others.

70
00:06:37.773 --> 00:06:39.775
Well, there's no harm in asking.

71
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:45.614
I want you to use class time today
to begin working on your ideas.

72
00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:47.908
The May Day celebration is big time.

73
00:06:48.033 --> 00:06:49.826
The whole town will be there.

74
00:06:49.952 --> 00:06:52.287
Maybe I'll get a contract.

75
00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:55.874
We can do any idea we want.
Even make our own costumes.

76
00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:57.835
- Cool.
- It'll be a lotta work.

77
00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.337
My mom knows
how to make great costumes.

78
00:07:00.462 --> 00:07:04.091
- My mom can sew really good.
- My mom knows a lot about hula.

79
00:07:04.216 --> 00:07:07.219
- She can help me with it.
- I guess Lilo's on her own.

80
00:07:07.344 --> 00:07:09.805
- She doesn't have a mom.
- Don't say that.

81
00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.474
- It's the truth.
- Not everyone has a mom.

82
00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:14.768
All right, don't bite my head off.

83
00:07:14.893 --> 00:07:17.396
I don't know
what costume I'm gonna wear.

84
00:07:18.647 --> 00:07:21.400
Lilo, may I speak with you?

85
00:07:24.653 --> 00:07:27.406
This is a book of past winners.

86
00:07:27.531 --> 00:07:29.533
Do you know who this is?

87
00:07:30.868 --> 00:07:32.661
It's your mother.

88
00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:34.580
My mom?

89
00:07:34.705 --> 00:07:37.958
She won the competition
when she was your age.

90
00:07:38.083 --> 00:07:44.631
She was as beautiful as an orchid
and as graceful as a rolling wave.

91
00:07:45.924 --> 00:07:48.343
Here. To inspire you.

92
00:07:53.307 --> 00:07:55.017
That's my mom.

93
00:07:55.142 --> 00:07:58.437
She won the competition
when she was my age.

94
00:08:05.986 --> 00:08:10.115
Hey, Lilo.
Maybe your dog can take a picture of me

95
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.618
when I win the competition.

96
00:08:12.743 --> 00:08:15.787
- How do you know you'll win?
- It's pretty well known

97
00:08:15.913 --> 00:08:19.416
that I'm the best dancer
in the seven-year-old division.

98
00:08:19.541 --> 00:08:22.711
I don't know.
I think maybe I can win.

99
00:08:22.836 --> 00:08:25.005
Hello! You're a stinky dancer,

100
00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:27.799
and anything you come up with
will be stinky.

101
00:08:30.177 --> 00:08:33.597
You'll never be like your mom. Never.

102
00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:37.142
- OK.
- That's it.

103
00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:38.727
Smile.

104
00:08:45.984 --> 00:08:51.281
As you can see,
there was a little disagreement again.

105
00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:54.743
Next time, flush the evidence.

106
00:08:56.578 --> 00:08:59.831
Why don't you come inside, Kumu.
Excuse the mess.

107
00:09:01.416 --> 00:09:03.252
We have a full house.

108
00:09:03.377 --> 00:09:07.756
Make yourself at home, Kumu.
I just made some lemonade.

109
00:09:09.383 --> 00:09:14.012
- Nani, we're out of lemonade.
- Pleakley, I just made that.

110
00:09:14.137 --> 00:09:17.099
Nani. You have to come to lab
and see my new invention.

111
00:09:17.224 --> 00:09:19.101
I just mopped in here.

112
00:09:19.226 --> 00:09:21.854
It will improve
your primitive earthly life.

113
00:09:21.979 --> 00:09:26.316
Speaking of improving your life,
I've just been reading this article

114
00:09:26.441 --> 00:09:28.485
called                 Ten Days To A Slimmer You.

115
00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:30.571
Full of wonderful suggestions.

116
00:09:30.696 --> 00:09:33.824
Guys, I don't have time for this.
We have a guest.

117
00:09:33.949 --> 00:09:36.410
A guest? Let's go meet him.

118
00:09:36.535 --> 00:09:39.788
Let's not.
Lilo's in enough trouble.

119
00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:42.583
- Trouble?
- All out of lemonade.

120
00:09:42.708 --> 00:09:48.505
Anyway, I know my sister
is very sorry and didn't mean it.

121
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.507
- Very sorry.
- See?

122
00:09:50.632 --> 00:09:52.301
- But I did mean it.
- Lilo?

123
00:09:52.426 --> 00:09:55.762
Next time,
Mertle Edmunds is going down.

124
00:09:55.888 --> 00:09:57.931
She's going way down.

125
00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.852
No more pro wrestling for you.

126
00:10:01.977 --> 00:10:04.938
Where is she?

127
00:10:08.025 --> 00:10:12.446
There's our precious angel, who must be
the victim of a misunderstanding.

128
00:10:12.571 --> 00:10:14.489
- Oh, no, no...
- Where is she?

129
00:10:14.615 --> 00:10:18.452
- Jumba. What are you doing?
- Don't worry. The cavalry has arrived.

130
00:10:18.577 --> 00:10:20.579
There she is.

131
00:10:20.704 --> 00:10:24.416
Somebody give this kid gold star,
she's so good.

132
00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:26.210
I don't believe we've met.

133
00:10:26.335 --> 00:10:30.631
This is Uncle Jumba
and I'm Auntie Pleakley.

134
00:10:30.756 --> 00:10:33.884
On second thought, Kumu,
we should talk outside.

135
00:10:34.009 --> 00:10:36.470
It's not polite
to interrupt your auntie.

136
00:10:36.595 --> 00:10:37.888
- Knock, knock.
- David.

137
00:10:38.013 --> 00:10:40.807
How's it, everybody?

138
00:10:40.933 --> 00:10:44.686
You remember my Auntie Pleakley
and Uncle Jumba, right?

139
00:10:45.938 --> 00:10:47.981
Say something.

140
00:10:49.191 --> 00:10:51.985
- Nice hat.
- Thank you, David.

141
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:55.280
See? Uncle Jumba
said it made me look top-heavy.

142
00:10:55.405 --> 00:10:57.407
Aunt Pleakley wanted the truth.

143
00:10:57.533 --> 00:11:01.787
What we want and what we need
are entirely different things.

144
00:11:01.912 --> 00:11:06.458
It's true what they say. Men are
from Mars and women are from Venus.

145
00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:08.126
- Nani.
- Yeah?

146
00:11:08.252 --> 00:11:10.838
You've been stressing,
so I got movie tickets.

147
00:11:10.963 --> 00:11:16.969
Movie? David, I would love to, really,
but I'm gonna have to rain check.

148
00:11:17.094 --> 00:11:19.388
That's OK. I understand.

149
00:11:19.513 --> 00:11:22.057
Great. Thanks for understanding.

150
00:11:22.182 --> 00:11:25.519
I dare you to say
that's not flattering, even on him.

151
00:11:25.644 --> 00:11:28.814
I'm sure that Kumu
isn't interested in this.

152
00:11:28.939 --> 00:11:30.983
Nice to be meeting you.

153
00:11:31.859 --> 00:11:33.819
Bye-bye.

154
00:11:33.944 --> 00:11:36.154
Good thing we were here.

155
00:11:37.447 --> 00:11:39.241
I'm not talking to you.

156
00:11:40.284 --> 00:11:42.494
Sorry about the relatives, Kumu.

157
00:11:42.619 --> 00:11:47.291
Yeah, sorry. Thanks for coming.
See ya at the competition.

158
00:11:47.416 --> 00:11:49.209
Lilo?

159
00:11:56.508 --> 00:11:58.886
I know you want to be
in the competition,

160
00:11:59.011 --> 00:12:02.389
but your behaviour today
makes me think you're not ready.

161
00:12:02.514 --> 00:12:05.893
No. I'm ready. It's just...

162
00:12:06.894 --> 00:12:10.647
Mertle pushed my buttons.
I'll be good. I mean it.

163
00:12:10.772 --> 00:12:15.903
I hope so. If there's any more trouble,
you won't be allowed in the competition.

164
00:12:16.028 --> 00:12:18.572
I promise.
There won't be any trouble.

165
00:12:18.697 --> 00:12:22.618
I promise, promise.
I triple promise.

166
00:12:22.743 --> 00:12:25.704
- OK, then.
- Thank you, Kumu.

167
00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:28.916
You don't have to worry.
I've seen the error of my ways.

168
00:12:29.041 --> 00:12:32.794
I will be good from now on
and be the best hula dancer ever.

169
00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:34.796
You'll see. I can do it.

170
00:12:34.922 --> 00:12:37.758
There's no way I can do this.

171
00:12:41.094 --> 00:12:45.807
Just because my mom was a great
hula dancer doesn't mean I am.

172
00:12:45.933 --> 00:12:51.313
The only thing I know I inherited
from her is, well, Nani.

173
00:12:55.400 --> 00:13:00.572
What if Mertle's right and
everything I do is gonna be stinky?

174
00:13:00.697 --> 00:13:05.118
Maybe I'm just stinky, like cheese.

175
00:13:10.666 --> 00:13:16.171
But my mom was beautiful like an orchid
and graceful like a wave.

176
00:13:22.594 --> 00:13:24.471
I'll never be like her.

177
00:13:52.583 --> 00:13:54.626
You think I can do it?

178
00:13:54.751 --> 00:13:57.796
We do together.

179
00:14:01.133 --> 00:14:04.678
- Let's win this thing. Okey...
- Dokey.

180
00:14:04.803 --> 00:14:07.139
Hula ideas, take one.

181
00:14:07.264 --> 00:14:09.308
Mummies.

182
00:14:12.144 --> 00:14:14.980
Amputation.

183
00:14:15.105 --> 00:14:16.899
Vampire bats.

184
00:14:17.024 --> 00:14:18.692
Recycling.

185
00:14:18.817 --> 00:14:20.444
Gossip.

186
00:14:20.569 --> 00:14:22.029
Skydive.

187
00:14:25.032 --> 00:14:27.659
I wonder if Elvis had these problems.

188
00:14:27.784 --> 00:14:29.203
Done.

189
00:14:29.328 --> 00:14:34.374
OK, everyone, family fun night
is ready to begin.

190
00:14:35.501 --> 00:14:37.044
Everyone?

191
00:14:38.337 --> 00:14:39.755
Anyone?

192
00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:44.134
Guys, family fun night.
Everything's ready.

193
00:14:44.259 --> 00:14:45.969
Let's... What's going on?

194
00:14:46.094 --> 00:14:49.640
We're increasing the flow of blood
to our brains to make us think.

195
00:14:49.765 --> 00:14:52.893
- We've only got one day and 23 hours...
- And 16 minutes.

196
00:14:53.018 --> 00:14:54.978
...to come up with the winning idea,

197
00:14:55.103 --> 00:14:57.856
- so please leave us alone to think.
- Please.

198
00:14:57.981 --> 00:15:02.861
You'll figure it out, and if you ask me,
it's a perfect time to take a break.

199
00:15:02.986 --> 00:15:06.657
- Pass.
- I said, if you ask me, it's...

200
00:15:06.782 --> 00:15:10.452
- We kinda didn't ask you.
- That's it, you two.

201
00:15:10.577 --> 00:15:13.789
I've been cooking for hours
and finally picked up the house

202
00:15:13.914 --> 00:15:17.835
just so we can have quality fun time
like Mom used to.

203
00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.295
You're part of this family,

204
00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:24.466
so you are gonna come downstairs
and have family fun.

205
00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:25.592
Fun, fun, fun.

206
00:15:28.804 --> 00:15:32.474
- Is everyone having fun?
- Yeah.

207
00:15:32.599 --> 00:15:34.393
- Great.
- Loads of fun.

208
00:15:34.518 --> 00:15:36.603
I made sci-fi snacks.

209
00:15:38.313 --> 00:15:41.316
We have deep-fried Martian cockroach.

210
00:15:43.026 --> 00:15:44.820
Delicious.

211
00:15:44.945 --> 00:15:48.407
- I think I'm gonna throw up.
- I think someone did.

212
00:15:48.532 --> 00:15:51.451
Nani, what are these?

213
00:15:51.577 --> 00:15:54.329
Alien-eyeball dumplings.

214
00:15:54.454 --> 00:15:56.623
What kinda sick joke is this?

215
00:15:56.748 --> 00:15:58.792
Don't be making her mad. Eat it.

216
00:16:01.587 --> 00:16:03.547
It's good.

217
00:16:11.388 --> 00:16:14.266
- Cockroach?
- I'm too upset to eat.

218
00:16:14.391 --> 00:16:16.351
I'm hula-less.

219
00:16:16.476 --> 00:16:19.229
I'm sure
you'll come up with something.

220
00:16:19.354 --> 00:16:21.648
Come on.
Let's watch the movie.

221
00:16:21.773 --> 00:16:25.485
...are dangerous. They'll destroy
everything in their path.

222
00:16:25.611 --> 00:16:27.571
The authorities are asking all...

223
00:16:29.406 --> 00:16:31.575
It's a bit redundant,
don't ya think?

224
00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:33.911
I'm trying to watch movie.

225
00:16:41.919 --> 00:16:44.254
- It's so beautiful.
- Nani,

226
00:16:44.379 --> 00:16:49.009
I think you did a great job
with family night.

227
00:16:50.135 --> 00:16:52.221
- I know what your problem is.
- What?

228
00:16:52.346 --> 00:16:56.725
I'm sorry to break it to you,
but your relationship has fizzled.

229
00:16:56.850 --> 00:17:00.395
- We've been only going out for 3 weeks.
- A fizzle is a fizzle.

230
00:17:00.521 --> 00:17:04.566
According to this,
comfort plus time equals boring.

231
00:17:04.691 --> 00:17:06.859
I think she's just tired.

232
00:17:06.984 --> 00:17:08.779
Tired, or tired of you?

233
00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.824
I wanted to dance
at your wedding, but...

234
00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:15.993
Fine.

235
00:18:05.294 --> 00:18:06.587
Stitch?

236
00:18:12.759 --> 00:18:14.386
Oh, no.

237
00:18:15.345 --> 00:18:17.598
Jumba, slow down.

238
00:18:17.723 --> 00:18:19.850
Where ya going? Include me.

239
00:18:19.975 --> 00:18:22.269
- Something's wrong with 626.
- What is it?

240
00:18:22.394 --> 00:18:24.771
- I don't know.
- Or won't tell?

241
00:18:24.897 --> 00:18:27.024
My good eye.

242
00:18:27.149 --> 00:18:28.859
You don't trust me.

243
00:18:28.984 --> 00:18:33.488
You won't tell me what's going on,
I won't tell you something.

244
00:18:33.614 --> 00:18:38.535
What an interesting secret
I have that I won't tell Jumba.

245
00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:40.579
It's a juicy one.

246
00:18:40.704 --> 00:18:43.207
- Quiet, you.
- OK, I don't have a secret.

247
00:18:43.332 --> 00:18:46.752
But don't shut me out.
Let me in.

248
00:18:46.877 --> 00:18:49.755
- What's that?
- Is sample of Stitch's fur.

249
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:53.759
Now we shall see.

250
00:18:56.553 --> 00:18:58.263
No.

251
00:18:58.388 --> 00:19:00.849
Those idiot police.

252
00:19:00.974 --> 00:19:03.143
I hoped this day would never come.

253
00:19:03.268 --> 00:19:07.439
What are you talking about?
What is wrong with Stitch?

254
00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:13.820
During his creation,
Stitch was never fully charged.

255
00:19:18.116 --> 00:19:20.536
There is it.

256
00:19:33.423 --> 00:19:35.759
That's not so easy on the throat.

257
00:19:37.261 --> 00:19:41.473
Can it be? Have I done it?

258
00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:53.193
So cute, so fluffy, even.

259
00:19:54.987 --> 00:19:57.614
Where did I go wrong?

260
00:20:00.784 --> 00:20:02.828
What a relief.

261
00:20:02.953 --> 00:20:07.416
Your name is 626. Isn't that nice?

262
00:20:08.792 --> 00:20:10.502
Oh, I know.

263
00:20:10.627 --> 00:20:16.091
You want to get out and wreak havoc,
but your molecules need to be charged.

264
00:20:16.216 --> 00:20:18.594
That's most important part.

265
00:20:25.142 --> 00:20:28.562
Meanwhile, I've got a surprise for you.
Close your eyes.

266
00:20:29.688 --> 00:20:32.107
No peeking. He cheats already.

267
00:20:37.321 --> 00:20:39.823
If it's too big, I have it taken in.

268
00:20:40.782 --> 00:20:45.537
- Open up. Intergalactic Police.
- Is nobody home.

269
00:20:45.662 --> 00:20:47.789
Cheque is in mail.

270
00:20:47.915 --> 00:20:49.958
I'm in the tub.

271
00:20:50.918 --> 00:20:54.588
You are under arrest
for illegal genetic experimentation.

272
00:20:54.713 --> 00:20:57.132
You idiots,
you will ruin everything.

273
00:20:58.133 --> 00:21:00.469
Tell it to the Council.

274
00:21:00.594 --> 00:21:02.888
- You two, get the evidence.
- Stop.

275
00:21:03.013 --> 00:21:05.265
His molecules aren't fully charged.

276
00:21:07.267 --> 00:21:09.311
Warning. Warning.

277
00:21:09.436 --> 00:21:11.813
Electromagnetic bonding incomplete.

278
00:21:11.939 --> 00:21:15.442
No, there's no telling what will happen.

279
00:21:15.567 --> 00:21:17.486
Let me go. No.

280
00:21:17.611 --> 00:21:22.491
What will become
of my little monstrosity?

281
00:21:22.616 --> 00:21:25.494
Now his circuits are going haywire.

282
00:21:25.619 --> 00:21:27.579
That's why he was freaking out.

283
00:21:27.704 --> 00:21:29.873
He can't control it. If it continues,

284
00:21:29.998 --> 00:21:33.252
his circuits will burn themselves out
like supernova.

285
00:21:33.377 --> 00:21:35.546
Can ya fix him?

286
00:21:35.671 --> 00:21:39.633
I must, or my little Stitch
will shut down...

287
00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:43.136
...for good.

288
00:21:57.943 --> 00:21:59.987
Stitch?

289
00:22:17.462 --> 00:22:20.340
Once there was a boy
with big, puffy hair

290
00:22:20.465 --> 00:22:23.844
who loved meat loaf a lot.

291
00:22:23.969 --> 00:22:26.889
So he put the leftovers
in his pillowcase.

292
00:22:27.014 --> 00:22:29.808
But that night,
a buzzard flew in the window

293
00:22:29.933 --> 00:22:32.477
and tried to eat the meat loaf.

294
00:22:32.603 --> 00:22:35.230
Trashed the whole house.

295
00:22:35.355 --> 00:22:38.692
And do you know who that boy was?

296
00:22:38.817 --> 00:22:40.819
Elvis.

297
00:22:40.944 --> 00:22:43.405
True story.

298
00:22:44.907 --> 00:22:47.492
I think Stitch feel better.

299
00:22:47.618 --> 00:22:50.120
Even Elvis slipped up sometimes.

300
00:22:50.245 --> 00:22:54.124
But he never stopped trying,
and neither can we.

301
00:22:55.918 --> 00:22:57.169
Elvis.

302
00:23:12.809 --> 00:23:14.394
At ease.

303
00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:18.023
When Elvis was in the army,
he got things done.

304
00:23:18.148 --> 00:23:23.654
Here's a map that shows
every place Elvis went to in Kauai.

305
00:23:23.779 --> 00:23:26.740
Our mission:
go to these places,

306
00:23:26.865 --> 00:23:30.577
where the King will give us
the idea for our hula.

307
00:23:31.828 --> 00:23:34.081
To the hovercraft.

308
00:23:34.206 --> 00:23:38.544
Thanks to a certain sister of mine,
we'll have to walk.

309
00:25:13.514 --> 00:25:17.518
This is the exact bench
where Elvis sat in                 Blue Hawaii.

310
00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:20.103
Yeah. That's him.

311
00:25:22.272 --> 00:25:28.695
I can't believe it. My butt is in
the shadow of the butt of Elvis Presley.

312
00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:30.781
Oh. Yes.

313
00:25:30.906 --> 00:25:32.783
OK, Elvis.

314
00:25:32.908 --> 00:25:36.954
We're ready to receive
a great idea for our hula.

315
00:25:50.676 --> 00:25:52.719
That's it. I got it.

316
00:25:52.845 --> 00:25:57.015
Elvis is trying to tell us
to do a hula about a chicken.

317
00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:02.104
No, he's not.

318
00:26:03.146 --> 00:26:06.859
There's plenty of other places
on the map that we can go to.

319
00:26:08.277 --> 00:26:09.987
We better hurry.

320
00:26:10.112 --> 00:26:12.614
Hey, drop it.

321
00:26:15.033 --> 00:26:16.326
Gotcha.

322
00:26:22.457 --> 00:26:23.625
Yes.

323
00:26:38.515 --> 00:26:40.684
We're sunk.

324
00:26:58.076 --> 00:27:00.996
I know it's hard
to keep the faith sometimes,

325
00:27:01.121 --> 00:27:05.334
but if you don't give up on Elvis,
Elvis won't give up on you.

326
00:27:14.927 --> 00:27:18.096
That song. It's about
the Hawaiian goddess Hi'iaka.

327
00:27:18.222 --> 00:27:20.182
That's right, Lilo.

328
00:27:20.307 --> 00:27:21.808
That's a great story.

329
00:27:21.934 --> 00:27:25.604
Friendship, jealousy,
death by molten lava.

330
00:27:25.729 --> 00:27:27.981
Do you know what this means?

331
00:27:29.483 --> 00:27:31.777
Thank you, Elvis.

332
00:27:31.902 --> 00:27:33.946
We got our hula.

333
00:27:45.958 --> 00:27:47.960
Stupid supercomputer.

334
00:27:48.085 --> 00:27:52.089
I know, Mom, but Jumba and I
have been very busy.

335
00:27:52.214 --> 00:27:54.800
My mom says hi.
He's waving.

336
00:27:54.925 --> 00:27:57.511
I can't talk about it, Mom.
It's top secret.

337
00:27:57.636 --> 00:28:00.347
- I said I was sorry.
- That's it.

338
00:28:00.472 --> 00:28:02.808
I have to go, Mom. Talk to you Sunday.

339
00:28:02.933 --> 00:28:05.102
I finished plans
for new fusion chamber

340
00:28:05.227 --> 00:28:07.771
- that will recharge Stitch.
- Way to go.

341
00:28:07.896 --> 00:28:10.732
But we don't have alien technology
to build it.

342
00:28:10.858 --> 00:28:12.150
Way to burst a bubble.

343
00:28:12.276 --> 00:28:17.239
We'll have to find primitive Earth
machinery and just hope it works.

344
00:28:17.364 --> 00:28:20.784
No prob. I can get
all those parts from the house.

345
00:28:23.203 --> 00:28:27.332
Stitch is having another episode.
They're getting worse.

346
00:28:27.457 --> 00:28:30.836
Hurry. These parts
are crucial to saving Stitch's life.

347
00:28:30.961 --> 00:28:33.005
Nothing can go wrong.

348
00:28:42.806 --> 00:28:44.349
Target sighted.

349
00:28:44.975 --> 00:28:46.810
Gotcha.

350
00:28:46.935 --> 00:28:49.771
Oh, no, it's you. I mean, hi, Nani.

351
00:28:49.897 --> 00:28:52.232
What are you doing with the toaster?

352
00:28:52.357 --> 00:28:55.319
This?
Yeah, interesting question.

353
00:28:55.444 --> 00:28:58.071
- What's going on?
- I was just about to...

354
00:28:58.197 --> 00:29:00.282
We have to hurry to... Nani...

355
00:29:00.407 --> 00:29:02.159
- To make toast.
- Toast?

356
00:29:02.284 --> 00:29:04.620
Making toast.
We're making toast.

357
00:29:04.745 --> 00:29:07.873
Toast. Who doesn't enjoy
nice crispy piece of toast?

358
00:29:07.998 --> 00:29:09.499
Answer: nobody.

359
00:29:09.625 --> 00:29:12.085
And there's so many different kinds.

360
00:29:12.211 --> 00:29:16.006
- Rye, sourdough, pumpernickel.
- You can put marmalade on it.

361
00:29:16.131 --> 00:29:19.218
Tasty toast.
You don't know what you're missing.

362
00:29:19.343 --> 00:29:21.220
- Care to try some?
- That's OK.

363
00:29:21.345 --> 00:29:23.055
I've gotta go to work.

364
00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:24.848
And, boys?

365
00:29:24.973 --> 00:29:27.935
Don't play with the toaster.

366
00:29:29.311 --> 00:29:30.938
Hi, David. Gotta run.

367
00:29:31.063 --> 00:29:33.941
If you're hungry,
we've got toast. Lots of toast.

368
00:29:34.066 --> 00:29:36.527
- Should I make more?
- Just get rid of him.

369
00:29:36.652 --> 00:29:39.071
- But how?
- You're the Earth expert.

370
00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:47.704
David.

371
00:29:47.829 --> 00:29:52.584
Poor, sweet David.
Trusting, naive David.

372
00:29:52.709 --> 00:29:57.130
- Maybe I do need help.
- You're in good hands.

373
00:29:57.256 --> 00:30:00.092
For 29.95, you can have
the kayak all day long.

374
00:30:00.217 --> 00:30:01.677
But, of course...

375
00:30:01.802 --> 00:30:03.846
Look at her.

376
00:30:04.763 --> 00:30:07.182
Doesn't even know you're here.

377
00:30:07.307 --> 00:30:10.018
- Maybe because we're hiding.
- I'm sorry.

378
00:30:10.143 --> 00:30:12.521
Is my relationship dying? No.

379
00:30:12.646 --> 00:30:15.023
OK. What you think I should do?

380
00:30:15.148 --> 00:30:18.110
It's obvious
she's taking you for granted.

381
00:30:18.235 --> 00:30:22.322
But she won't if she sees
another woman interested.

382
00:30:22.447 --> 00:30:24.491
What other woman?

383
00:30:26.326 --> 00:30:28.787
Have fun.

384
00:30:28.912 --> 00:30:32.374
You're so fascinating and tan.

385
00:30:32.499 --> 00:30:35.460
I'm so clumsy.

386
00:30:35.586 --> 00:30:37.462
You've gotta be kidding.

387
00:30:37.588 --> 00:30:39.756
- I don't think...
- It's working.

388
00:30:39.882 --> 00:30:42.092
- She's coming over.
- Hey, Nani.

389
00:30:42.217 --> 00:30:44.636
No waving. Be cool.

390
00:30:44.761 --> 00:30:47.181
Is that a deltoid or a rhomboid?

391
00:30:49.099 --> 00:30:51.101
OK. David, I'm off at five.

392
00:30:51.226 --> 00:30:53.312
- Wanna get some dinner?
- Great.

393
00:30:53.437 --> 00:30:55.355
- He has plans.
- He does?

394
00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:57.900
With me.
I'm the new girl on the island.

395
00:30:58.025 --> 00:30:59.985
Let me get this straight.

396
00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:02.779
You came here
and interrupted me to tell me

397
00:31:02.905 --> 00:31:06.158
you have pretend plans with Pleakley?

398
00:31:06.283 --> 00:31:08.994
I don't know
what you're talking about.

399
00:31:09.119 --> 00:31:12.623
My name is Inga.
I'm a foreign exchange student.

400
00:31:12.748 --> 00:31:14.291
Are you jealous?

401
00:31:15.918 --> 00:31:17.252
No.

402
00:31:18.795 --> 00:31:20.297
You blew it.

403
00:31:40.734 --> 00:31:43.779
This is how the story goes, Stitch.

404
00:31:43.904 --> 00:31:47.616
Once, there was a beautiful
goddess named Hi'iaka

405
00:31:47.741 --> 00:31:50.577
and a handsome mortal
named Lo'hiau.

406
00:31:52.204 --> 00:31:55.582
They were as close
as two people could be.

407
00:31:59.253 --> 00:32:01.338
But one day, Pelé,

408
00:32:01.463 --> 00:32:05.300
the volcano goddess,
grew jealous of their friendship.

409
00:32:07.719 --> 00:32:12.474
So she took Lo'hiau
and threw him into a volcano

410
00:32:12.599 --> 00:32:14.601
filled with molten lava.

411
00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:19.314
- Stitch.
- My bad.

412
00:32:24.862 --> 00:32:27.823
Hi'iaka discovered
his body in a cavern

413
00:32:27.948 --> 00:32:31.535
by a sea cliff,
and she stayed with him,

414
00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:35.247
praying to the gods
to bring Lo'hiau's spirit back.

415
00:32:37.916 --> 00:32:41.837
And it worked.
Her love brought him back to life,

416
00:32:41.962 --> 00:32:47.050
proving that love
is more powerful than death.

417
00:32:56.393 --> 00:32:58.478
We are ready for rehearsal.

418
00:33:02.357 --> 00:33:07.362
OK, girls, this is your last rehearsal
before tomorrow's competition.

419
00:33:07.487 --> 00:33:10.574
What if I forget the moves
and Mertle laughs at me?

420
00:33:10.699 --> 00:33:13.827
And I get mad and pound her?

421
00:33:13.952 --> 00:33:16.413
You gotta help me, Stitch.
I need you.

422
00:33:16.538 --> 00:33:18.332
We do together.

423
00:33:22.878 --> 00:33:26.131
Our hula is about an ancient friendship

424
00:33:26.256 --> 00:33:29.801
that proves love
is more powerful than death.

425
00:33:29.927 --> 00:33:31.637
Oh, brother.

426
00:33:31.762 --> 00:33:35.516
The great goddess Hi'iaka...
That's me.

427
00:33:35.641 --> 00:33:38.810
And the brave and handsome
mortal Lo'hiau.

428
00:33:41.146 --> 00:33:43.357
That's Stitch.

429
00:33:48.529 --> 00:33:52.908
I said,
the handsome mortal Lo'hiau.

430
00:33:55.369 --> 00:33:58.664
Handsome mortal.

431
00:33:58.789 --> 00:34:00.666
Stink-o-rama.

432
00:34:00.791 --> 00:34:02.709
Stitch, get out here.

433
00:34:05.629 --> 00:34:07.923
What are you doing?

434
00:34:09.257 --> 00:34:11.051
Cut it out.

435
00:34:11.176 --> 00:34:14.388
That's not what we practised.

436
00:34:14.513 --> 00:34:15.764
Stitch.

437
00:34:20.853 --> 00:34:23.813
- Stop it.
- He's crazy.

438
00:34:26.525 --> 00:34:28.485
Girls, girls, get behind me.

439
00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:31.530
Lilo, get control of your dog.
Nice doggy...

440
00:34:31.655 --> 00:34:33.532
Lilo.

441
00:34:42.248 --> 00:34:47.087
Lilo, you will not be allowed
to rehearse at this hulau again.

442
00:34:51.592 --> 00:34:54.511
Lilo, I...

443
00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:02.603
Come on.
It couldn't have been that bad.

444
00:35:04.146 --> 00:35:07.608
- It was.
- Have a good one.

445
00:35:07.733 --> 00:35:11.904
- You're not listening to me.
- I'm listening. I have to work.

446
00:35:12.029 --> 00:35:17.409
My hula career is falling to pieces,
and you're worried about stinking work?

447
00:35:17.534 --> 00:35:20.037
Stitch needs you
to be patient with him.

448
00:35:20.162 --> 00:35:22.998
- He did it on purpose.
- You don't mean that.

449
00:35:23.123 --> 00:35:25.584
You should have seen
the way he was acting.

450
00:35:25.709 --> 00:35:29.505
- Aren't you being overdramatic?
- Nani, his goodness level...

451
00:37:17.863 --> 00:37:22.034
The great goddess Hi'iaka...
That's me.

452
00:37:22.159 --> 00:37:26.038
And the brave mortal Lo'hiau...

453
00:37:27.289 --> 00:37:29.333
That's also me.

454
00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:34.880
...were best friends.

455
00:37:35.005 --> 00:37:37.216
Lilo, look.

456
00:37:37.341 --> 00:37:41.803
- Their friendship proved...
- I'm good now. No more badness.

457
00:37:41.929 --> 00:37:43.805
Sorry.

458
00:37:45.516 --> 00:37:48.268
- The great goddess Hi'iaka...
- Stitch good.

459
00:37:48.393 --> 00:37:50.562
Stitch, just get outta here.

460
00:37:50.687 --> 00:37:53.357
Fuzzball.

461
00:37:53.482 --> 00:37:56.151
- No, you out.
- No, you.

462
00:37:56.276 --> 00:37:58.445
- You.
- You.

463
00:37:58.570 --> 00:38:00.113
Fine.

464
00:38:00.239 --> 00:38:02.199
I will.

465
00:38:02.324 --> 00:38:04.785
- No, Stitch will.
- I'm leaving first.

466
00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:07.955
- I'm leaving first. I am.
- No. Stitch first.

467
00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:11.625
Who took my hair...
Who took my hairdryer?

468
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:14.378
Get back here. You'll be sorry.

469
00:38:14.503 --> 00:38:18.298
- Open this door, trog.
- Who's there?

470
00:38:18.423 --> 00:38:21.635
- Stitch. Open the door.
- OK.

471
00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:24.221
- What is up with you two?
- Nani, it's me.

472
00:38:24.346 --> 00:38:26.557
Neither of you move a muscle.

473
00:38:26.682 --> 00:38:31.061
David,
I'm glad you're here... David?

474
00:38:31.186 --> 00:38:33.981
Nani, you're not
the only fish in the sea.

475
00:38:34.106 --> 00:38:38.527
- Tell her you have...
- Because I have a lot of...

476
00:38:38.652 --> 00:38:42.406
- Tell her your options.
- Options?

477
00:38:42.531 --> 00:38:44.992
Options. Really?

478
00:38:54.001 --> 00:38:56.503
Are you jealous?

479
00:38:58.589 --> 00:39:01.258
- She's touching me.
- I'm not touching you.

480
00:39:01.383 --> 00:39:03.760
- You're touching me.
- Not touching.

481
00:39:03.886 --> 00:39:06.555
- Touching me.
- It's free air.

482
00:39:07.431 --> 00:39:09.474
Would you cut it out?

483
00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:11.894
This is crazy.
You guys are family.

484
00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:18.984
- Why are you fighting?
- Because he ruins everything.

485
00:39:19.109 --> 00:39:22.654
- Not my fault.
- Then whose fault is it?

486
00:39:22.779 --> 00:39:24.781
You're dead meat.

487
00:39:25.324 --> 00:39:27.451
That is it.

488
00:39:27.576 --> 00:39:30.829
Go to your room and make up
like loving friends.

489
00:39:30.954 --> 00:39:32.581
- You're gross.
- Stupid head.

490
00:39:32.706 --> 00:39:34.499
Keep walking.

491
00:39:42.883 --> 00:39:47.221
- Stitch sorry.
- We said we were gonna be good.

492
00:39:47.346 --> 00:39:49.389
I needed you, Stitch.

493
00:39:54.895 --> 00:39:57.481
Stitch good again.

494
00:40:02.402 --> 00:40:06.865
If you promise to be good,
I'll give you one more chance.

495
00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:11.161
- But I want you to promise.
- Oh, yeah.

496
00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:17.000
You get the costumes,
and I'll get the record player.

497
00:40:19.545 --> 00:40:21.380
Stitch good.

498
00:40:22.965 --> 00:40:24.550
Stitch good...

499
00:40:33.392 --> 00:40:34.935
We are ready.

500
00:40:38.105 --> 00:40:39.731
- Stitch.
- Lilo.

501
00:40:39.857 --> 00:40:42.776
- Everything's ruined.
- I sorry.

502
00:40:42.901 --> 00:40:45.362
I don't know
why I ever believed you.

503
00:40:45.487 --> 00:40:47.948
Something wrong with Stitch.

504
00:40:48.073 --> 00:40:50.117
I know what's wrong with you.

505
00:40:50.242 --> 00:40:54.371
You're bad, and you'll always be bad.

506
00:41:01.587 --> 00:41:03.589
Three. Two. One.

507
00:41:05.132 --> 00:41:06.675
There it is, Pleakley.

508
00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:10.804
The fusion chamber,
the only thing that can save Stitch.

509
00:41:10.929 --> 00:41:14.224
- It's amazing.
- Just another work of genius.

510
00:41:14.349 --> 00:41:17.227
Can I switch it on? Please?

511
00:41:17.352 --> 00:41:19.313
Oh, no.

512
00:41:19.438 --> 00:41:22.191
That is extremely delicate machine.

513
00:41:22.316 --> 00:41:24.902
It takes superior mind.

514
00:41:31.283 --> 00:41:34.369
Thanks to me, crisis is over.

515
00:41:38.332 --> 00:41:40.542
Jumba?

516
00:41:40.667 --> 00:41:42.711
What happened?

517
00:41:53.138 --> 00:41:56.308
That's it, Pleakley. It's over.

518
00:41:56.433 --> 00:41:59.228
I can't build a new fusion chamber.

519
00:41:59.353 --> 00:42:01.939
Sure you can,
like you built the first one.

520
00:42:02.064 --> 00:42:07.653
I didn't build first one.
I ordered it from catalogue.

521
00:42:07.778 --> 00:42:09.196
A catalogue?

522
00:42:09.321 --> 00:42:13.116
And now there is no hope
for my little creation.

523
00:42:20.499 --> 00:42:23.502
Jumba has failed family.

524
00:42:23.627 --> 00:42:27.631
So you didn't build
the first fusion chamber. So what?

525
00:42:27.756 --> 00:42:31.635
You still built Stitch, didn't ya?

526
00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:33.178
Yes.

527
00:42:33.303 --> 00:42:35.889
And you're still an evil genius.
Admit it.

528
00:42:36.014 --> 00:42:39.309
No, I don't like to brag.

529
00:42:39.434 --> 00:42:43.856
That's why
you're the only one who can do it.

530
00:42:50.487 --> 00:42:52.197
Pleakley, my wrench.

531
00:42:57.536 --> 00:42:59.204
Lilo?

532
00:43:02.833 --> 00:43:04.376
Hey, Lilo.

533
00:43:04.501 --> 00:43:07.754
I'm not doing the hula with him.
So don't try to make me.

534
00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:09.464
OK.

535
00:43:09.590 --> 00:43:12.009
He's ruining my chance of winning.

536
00:43:12.134 --> 00:43:15.137
Lilo, it's just a contest.

537
00:43:15.262 --> 00:43:17.347
No, it's not. Now get off my bed.

538
00:43:17.472 --> 00:43:20.559
- Not until we talk about this.
- You're no help.

539
00:43:20.684 --> 00:43:23.687
- I wish Mom were here.
- I'm doing the best I can.

540
00:43:23.812 --> 00:43:27.858
- It's not good enough.
- Don't you think I know that?

541
00:43:47.294 --> 00:43:52.174
Remember how she would always
make up those funny constellations?

542
00:43:52.299 --> 00:43:54.218
Like Swiss Cheese Man?

543
00:43:54.343 --> 00:43:57.137
Where is the Stinky Bag
of Garbage again?

544
00:43:57.262 --> 00:43:59.973
Near the Sour Milky Way.

545
00:44:00.098 --> 00:44:05.229
Right near the Old Lady
with the Chihuahua on her Head.

546
00:44:10.275 --> 00:44:14.404
I have to win the contest,
just like Mom did.

547
00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:20.369
If I win, she'll know I'm good,
and she'll be proud of me.

548
00:44:21.453 --> 00:44:23.038
Oh, baby.

549
00:44:23.163 --> 00:44:27.709
You don't have to win anything
for Mom to be proud of you.

550
00:44:27.835 --> 00:44:31.672
- How do you know?
- Because I know everything.

551
00:44:32.798 --> 00:44:34.967
OK, I don't know everything,

552
00:44:35.092 --> 00:44:40.389
but I think Mom would be proud of you
just for being you.

553
00:44:41.431 --> 00:44:43.392
You too.

554
00:44:44.935 --> 00:44:46.895
Thanks, Lilo.

555
00:45:44.745 --> 00:45:46.622
Stitch good.

556
00:45:52.336 --> 00:45:54.254
Stitch good now.

557
00:46:44.054 --> 00:46:45.764
Do you think Lilo will show up?

558
00:46:45.889 --> 00:46:50.102
After that rehearsal?
She wouldn't dare.

559
00:47:43.655 --> 00:47:47.201
I just wanted to say
I am very proud of all your hard work.

560
00:47:47.326 --> 00:47:50.579
If it were up to me,
you would all win first place.

561
00:47:52.706 --> 00:47:55.709
He's just saying that
so the losers don't feel bad.

562
00:47:56.502 --> 00:47:58.545
Hi, Nani.

563
00:48:06.386 --> 00:48:09.640
Welcome to
our annual May Day Festival,

564
00:48:09.765 --> 00:48:13.352
where one of our little girls
will be chosen                 alaka'i.

565
00:48:13.477 --> 00:48:17.481
First up is Aleka,
doing the dance of the pineapple.

566
00:48:25.781 --> 00:48:27.824
That should do it.

567
00:48:32.829 --> 00:48:35.791
What if it doesn't work?

568
00:48:35.916 --> 00:48:37.626
It will.

569
00:48:50.973 --> 00:48:53.433
Next up is Mertle Edmunds.

570
00:48:57.145 --> 00:49:00.524
It's a gift certificate
to my daddy's store.

571
00:49:00.649 --> 00:49:02.067
Hit it.

572
00:49:04.027 --> 00:49:07.489
Legend tells of a man named Karl

573
00:49:07.614 --> 00:49:10.909
who dreamt of offering
authentic Hawaiian collectibles

574
00:49:11.034 --> 00:49:13.453
at an affordable price.

575
00:49:13.579 --> 00:49:17.791
Like this costume
in seven natural colours,

576
00:49:17.916 --> 00:49:23.297
and these genuine faux pearls,
each a jewel of the Pacific.

577
00:49:24.506 --> 00:49:26.425
The best things in life

578
00:49:26.550 --> 00:49:30.929
are marked down for clearance
this weekend at Karl's.

579
00:49:32.222 --> 00:49:34.391
Mertle, what can I say?

580
00:49:35.392 --> 00:49:37.436
Thank you.

581
00:49:38.145 --> 00:49:40.397
It's in the bag.

582
00:49:40.522 --> 00:49:44.359
If Jumba and Pleakley don't get here
soon, they're gonna miss Lilo.

583
00:49:49.615 --> 00:49:51.992
- No.
- What's happening?

584
00:49:52.117 --> 00:49:56.371
His circuits are about to blow. We have
to get him in the fusion chamber now.

585
00:49:57.122 --> 00:50:00.042
- Shouldn't we test it?
- There isn't time.

586
00:50:01.543 --> 00:50:03.295
Next we have Lilo,

587
00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:06.840
who's doing her hula
about an ancient friendship.

588
00:50:06.965 --> 00:50:09.510
This is it.

589
00:50:09.635 --> 00:50:11.929
- You'll be great.
- Stitch?

590
00:50:12.054 --> 00:50:16.433
- I just want to say I...
- I can't talk now.

591
00:50:16.558 --> 00:50:19.895
- I have to go on.
- I know.

592
00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:22.606
- Badness coming on.
- What?

593
00:50:22.731 --> 00:50:25.776
- I have to...
- Are you OK?

594
00:50:26.902 --> 00:50:28.237
Stitch.

595
00:50:37.996 --> 00:50:39.790
No.

596
00:50:39.915 --> 00:50:43.794
- Stitch?
- No, Lilo. Too dangerous.

597
00:50:45.546 --> 00:50:48.882
- Stitch?
- It's your turn. Everybody's waiting.

598
00:50:59.309 --> 00:51:02.896
My hula is about
an ancient friendship...

599
00:51:04.523 --> 00:51:08.360
...that proves love
is more powerful than death.

600
00:51:39.850 --> 00:51:41.935
I'm sorry, Mom.

601
00:51:46.523 --> 00:51:49.067
Stitch. Come back.

602
00:51:49.193 --> 00:51:52.362
- Have you seen Stitch?
- We thought he was with you.

603
00:51:52.487 --> 00:51:56.742
- Lilo, what happened?
- Something's wrong with Stitch.

604
00:51:56.867 --> 00:51:58.911
He's malfunctioning.

605
00:51:59.036 --> 00:52:01.079
And if we don't find him soon...

606
00:52:07.461 --> 00:52:08.837
Stitch.

607
00:52:10.631 --> 00:52:13.258
- Where are you?
- Stitch.

608
00:52:13.383 --> 00:52:15.010
You there?

609
00:52:28.398 --> 00:52:30.067
No.

610
00:52:30.192 --> 00:52:32.611
We'll find him.

611
00:52:34.738 --> 00:52:38.534
- We looked everywhere.
- He only has few minutes left.

612
00:52:40.786 --> 00:52:42.704
- The ship.
- The fusion chamber.

613
00:53:08.063 --> 00:53:10.190
We have to stop him.

614
00:53:15.404 --> 00:53:18.824
- I think I should drive.
- Two eyes. My car. I'm driving.

615
00:53:20.701 --> 00:53:24.788
At the rate he is going, he's soon
to be accelerating into stratosphere.

616
00:53:24.913 --> 00:53:27.249
If only we had way
to communicate with him.

617
00:53:27.374 --> 00:53:32.129
Stitch has taken off in the ship,
and we have no way to contact him.

618
00:53:32.254 --> 00:53:35.132
- Poor Jumba. He's worked so hard.
- Give me that.

619
00:53:35.257 --> 00:53:39.136
Yes, Mother Pleakley.
He'll call you back.

620
00:53:39.261 --> 00:53:42.764
Hello. Thanks for using
the Uninhabited Planet Index,

621
00:53:42.890 --> 00:53:46.602
your guide to the galaxy's
most isolated and lonely locations.

622
00:53:46.727 --> 00:53:50.522
If your selection is Planet Z-13,
engage hyper-drive.

623
00:53:50.647 --> 00:53:53.817
Stitch. Can you hear me? I need you.

624
00:53:53.942 --> 00:53:55.819
Please come back.

625
00:53:55.944 --> 00:53:59.948
Stitch can never come back.

626
00:54:06.413 --> 00:54:08.707
He's lost control of ship.

627
00:54:18.217 --> 00:54:20.427
What do we do now?

628
00:54:23.722 --> 00:54:25.974
It was my best hiding place.

629
00:54:32.397 --> 00:54:35.526
Get him into fusion chamber
before his energy runs out.

630
00:54:35.651 --> 00:54:38.153
Is only chance.

631
00:54:51.708 --> 00:54:52.793
No.

632
00:54:55.254 --> 00:54:57.464
Stitch?

633
00:55:10.602 --> 00:55:13.397
No, Lilo. Too dangerous.

634
00:55:13.522 --> 00:55:16.108
You're not dangerous.

635
00:55:17.526 --> 00:55:20.320
We have to get you
into Jumba's machine.

636
00:55:33.834 --> 00:55:36.753
No worry.
I've got you, Nani.

637
00:56:00.569 --> 00:56:03.030
You're gonna be OK now.

638
00:56:05.324 --> 00:56:06.909
Please be OK.

639
00:56:12.664 --> 00:56:14.750
Stitch sorry.

640
00:56:26.345 --> 00:56:29.431
Hurry, before... Oh, no.

641
00:56:29.556 --> 00:56:33.310
Jumba, it's not working.

642
00:56:41.401 --> 00:56:43.195
We're too late.

643
00:57:04.716 --> 00:57:07.052
- No.
- Lilo.

644
00:57:07.177 --> 00:57:09.721
There's nothing you can do.

645
00:57:11.223 --> 00:57:12.766
He's gone.

646
00:57:12.891 --> 00:57:14.268
Honey, come here.

647
00:57:14.393 --> 00:57:15.853
No.

648
00:57:19.273 --> 00:57:21.525
Stitch.

649
00:57:21.650 --> 00:57:24.111
I'm so sorry.

650
00:57:28.657 --> 00:57:30.993
I kept saying how I needed you.

651
00:57:33.829 --> 00:57:36.039
But you needed me more.

652
00:57:52.306 --> 00:57:54.266
You're my                 ohana,                 Stitch.

653
00:57:57.811 --> 00:58:00.355
And I'll always love you.

654
00:58:47.402 --> 00:58:51.114
Stitch not bad.

655
00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:52.658
Stitch fluffy.

656
00:59:00.499 --> 00:59:02.584
But how is it possible?

657
00:59:02.709 --> 00:59:04.670
It's not.

658
00:59:05.838 --> 00:59:09.550
Stitch OK now?

659
00:59:10.592 --> 00:59:12.553
No more nightmares.

660
00:59:16.598 --> 00:59:18.475
You look fluffier than ever.

661
00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:20.853
Come here, you. Group hug.

662
00:59:29.528 --> 00:59:35.158
So Hi'iaka and Lo'hiau were reunited
and are together to this day.

663
01:00:11.153 --> 01:00:12.279
Nani.

664
01:00:38.013 --> 01:00:41.391
Mom would be so proud of you.
