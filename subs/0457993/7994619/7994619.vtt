- Where is she?

- Don't worry. The cavalry has arrived.

- There she is.
- No, no, no, no.

I don't believe we've met.

This is Uncle Jumba and
I'm Auntie Pleakley. <i>Enchantée.</i>

182
00:10:04.786 --> 00:10:07.817
On second thought, Kumu,
we should talk outside.

183
00:10:07.894 --> 00:10:09.965
It's not polite to interrupt your auntie.

184
00:10:10.042 --> 00:10:11.462
- Knock, knock.
- David.

How's it, everybody?

186
00:10:14.186 --> 00:10:18.022
You remember my Auntie Pleakley
and Uncle Jumba, right?

- Why, thank you, David.

190

See? Uncle Jumba
said it made me look top-heavy.

191
00:10:28.343 --> 00:10:30.185
Aunt Pleakley wanted the truth.

192
00:10:30.261 --> 00:10:34.367
What we want and what we need
are entirely different things.

193

David, I would love to, really,
but I'm gonna have to rain check.

- That's okay. I understand.
- Great. Thanks for understanding.

I dare you to say that's not flattering,
even on him.

isn't interested in this.

I know you want to be
in the competition,

211
00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:32.646
but your behavior today
makes me think you're not ready.

212
00:11:32.723 --> 00:11:34.833
No. I'm ready. It's just...

213
00:11:36.828 --> 00:11:40.588
Mertle pushed my buttons.
I'll be good. I mean it.

214
00:11:40.703 --> 00:11:45.614
I hope so. If there's any more trouble,
you won't be allowed in the competition.

- Thank you, Kumu.

218
00:11:55.206 --> 00:11:58.237
You don't have to worry.
I've seen the error of my ways.

219
00:11:58.313 --> 00:12:01.997
I will be good from now on
and be the best hula dancer ever.

220

You'll see. I can do it.

221

There's no way I can do this.

Just because my mom was
a great hula dancer doesn't mean I am.

I inherited from her is, well, Nani.

and everything I do is gonna be stinky?
