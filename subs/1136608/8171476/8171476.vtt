of different theories as to why</i>

<i>the ship seemed inoperable.</i>

56
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.717
And what was speculated was that
a command module had detached itself

57
00:03:42.884 --> 00:03:46.429
from the main ship and then somehow
mysteriously become lost.

58
00:03:46.637 --> 00:03:49.974
Did it fall by itself
or was it programmed?

59
00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:52.101
I don't know.

00:04:02.695 --> 00:04:04.947
We looked for it, all right?
We looked everywhere.

Tensions rose and rose.

67
00:04:16.751 --> 00:04:20.171
People became more and more fed up,

If they were from another country,
we might understand,

80
00:04:54.997 --> 00:04:56.874
The derogatory term "prawn"
is used for the alien,

81
00:04:57.041 --> 00:04:59.836

<i>and we believe that it is going

104

to sign the I-27 form.

115
00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.535
The legality that MNU is using to evict

123
00:07:23.563 --> 00:07:26.732
That didn‘t factor in my decision
to promote him.

124
00:07:26.899 --> 00:07:31.404
It's almost as big as my wedding day.
You know, not as big.

He said that way, they just mean
so much more.

He left this papier-mâché ball

and I sat down and I--

I kind of squished it.

You can see--

158
00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:10.544
That‘s above the allocated
amount of ammunition.

1604
01:40:56.587 --> 01:40:59.339
MAN <i>(ON TV): And people everywhere
across Johannesburg</i>

1605
01:40:59.506 --> 01:41:02.926
<i>are flooding the streets,
are pouring out of their offices.</i>

1606
01:41:03.093 --> 01:41:07.264
<i>And all eyes are pointing up towards
the sky on this momentous day.</i>

1607
01:41:07.431 --> 01:41:11.727
<i>It’s the first time, ladies and gentlemen,
in over two decades,</i>

1608
01:41:11.894 --> 01:41:14.354
<i>that the mother ship has shown
any sign of movement,</i>

1609
01:41:14.521 --> 01:41:16.398
<i>and people are tremendously excited.</i>

1610
01:41:16.565 --> 01:41:19.610
<i>The city has come
to an absolute standstill.</i>

1611
01:41:19.776 --> 01:41:24.323
<i>And everybody wants to know
what’s going to happen next.</i>

1612
01:41:24.489 --> 01:41:27.659
BRADNAM: <i>There’s no way of knowing whether
or not Christopher Johnson will return.</i>

1613
01:41:27.826 --> 01:41:29.453
We don't know if he
was simply escaping,

1614
01:41:29.620 --> 01:41:32.581
whether he will effect
a rescue plan,

1615
01:41:34.875 --> 01:41:37.085
and as the so-called
free press says,

1616
01:41:37.252 --> 01:41:40.589
whether or not he'll come back
and declare war on us.

1617
01:42:05.656 --> 01:42:09.952
BRADNAM: <i>This is the last known footage
of Wikus van de Merwe.</i>

1618
01:42:10.118 --> 01:42:14.998
<i>And we can only speculate
as to what has happened to him.</i>

1619
01:42:15.207 --> 01:42:19.336
The more zany conspiracy
theories state that

1620
01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:19.885
<i>(CRYING)</i>

1621
01:42:19.503 --> 01:42:23.840
he's been captured by MNU
or by another government.

1622
01:42:24.007 --> 01:42:26.301
Or by perhaps some
shady government agency

1623
01:42:26.468 --> 01:42:29.221
and is actually being held
in captivity.

1624
01:42:29.429 --> 01:42:31.765
You know, if we knew where he was,
we would try and help him.

1625
01:42:31.932 --> 01:42:35.477
And that is the most difficult part,
is just not knowing where he is.

1626
01:42:35.686 --> 01:42:37.562
Wikus, sadly, is gone,

1627
01:42:37.729 --> 01:42:42.567
but I'm the one who stays behind
with all the questions.

1628
01:42:42.734 --> 01:42:44.027
I can't give the answers.

1629
01:42:44.569 --> 01:42:47.739
He died in my mind
a long time ago.

1630
01:42:48.156 --> 01:42:49.199
And that's that.

1631
01:42:49.408 --> 01:42:53.078
Wikus van de Merwe is a name that will
become very, very widely known

1632
01:42:53.245 --> 01:42:56.999
because of this pivotal role that
he played in this whole event.

1633
01:42:57.207 --> 01:43:00.294
FUNDISWA: <i>He was an honest man and he didn’t
deserve any of what happened to him.</i>

1634
01:43:00.502 --> 01:43:04.214
<i>I mean, I know. I looked into
the computer system and I found stuff.</i>

1635
01:43:04.423 --> 01:43:07.843
I mean, the whole data
was there, you know?

1636
01:43:08.010 --> 01:43:10.304
They didn't even do a good job
of hiding it.

1637
01:43:28.739 --> 01:43:32.242
You guys haven't seen my wife.
Let me show you my wife.

1638
01:43:32.784 --> 01:43:34.494
She's my special angel.

1639
01:43:34.661 --> 01:43:37.748
There. She even looks like a angel
with a halo. You want to see that?

1640
01:43:37.914 --> 01:43:42.336
With the white veil over the head,
she even looks like an angel.

1641
01:43:42.502 --> 01:43:46.340
Everyone says his wife's an angel, but this
is a real angel that you're seeing there.

1642
01:43:46.506 --> 01:43:49.593
On the cameras. They won't put that
in the video, I don't think.

1643
01:43:56.266 --> 01:44:01.521
I found this at my front door, as though
somebody had just left it there.

1644
01:44:03.315 --> 01:44:07.235
My friends say I should just throw it away
because it's just a piece of rubbish.

1645
01:44:08.987 --> 01:44:11.948
And it couldn't possibly
come from him.

1646
01:44:12.949 --> 01:44:15.160
I know it's true.
