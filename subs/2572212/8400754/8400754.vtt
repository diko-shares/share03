WEBVTT

1
00:01:35.878 --> 00:01:38.837
I never knew why
we prayed so much growin' up.

2
00:01:40.274 --> 00:01:42.928
 So, one day them Union boys
came to my plantation

3
00:01:42.972 --> 00:01:45.061
 and told me and my folks
we were free.

4
00:01:47.281 --> 00:01:49.196
 Best day of our lives.

5
00:01:50.893 --> 00:01:53.113
 Mama said our prayers
had been answered.

6
00:01:57.552 --> 00:02:00.120
 I remember me and my folks
walking out that plantation

7
00:02:00.163 --> 00:02:02.731
 till our feet couldn't even
feel the ground no more.

8
00:02:04.472 --> 00:02:05.908
 We just kept walkin'.

9
00:02:07.475 --> 00:02:10.130
 Kept walkin',
but we had nowhere to go.

10
00:02:12.175 --> 00:02:14.656
We were free...

11
00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:17.049
 ...but we had no place
to be free.

12
00:02:18.834 --> 00:02:20.401
 So I'm askin' you, Lord...

13
00:02:22.881 --> 00:02:25.928
 ...protect me on this journey.

14
00:02:25.971 --> 00:02:28.887
 Help me reach my piece
of the promised land.

15
00:02:31.325 --> 00:02:33.065
 Deliver me from this evil.

16
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.199
 Amen.

17
00:02:38.332 --> 00:02:40.203
Get in.

18
00:03:05.272 --> 00:03:06.229
Move.

19
00:03:34.605 --> 00:03:36.433
The war
was an unfortunate step

20
00:03:36.477 --> 00:03:37.565
in the right direction.

21
00:03:37.608 --> 00:03:39.697
Look at
what just walked in.

22
00:03:41.656 --> 00:03:43.048
Where did he come from?

23
00:03:56.105 --> 00:03:57.802
Iron on the bar.

24
00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:16.995
Coffee. Please.

25
00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:18.170
Coffee.

26
00:04:19.824 --> 00:04:20.825
Yeah.

27
00:05:15.837 --> 00:05:16.838
Ma'am.

28
00:05:37.162 --> 00:05:39.208
Whoa there, fella!

29
00:05:39.251 --> 00:05:40.992
Where you think you're headed?

30
00:05:41.036 --> 00:05:42.559
I bought a seat.

31
00:05:42.603 --> 00:05:44.039
From the man up there.

32
00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:46.215
Andy, huh?

33
00:05:46.258 --> 00:05:48.826
This fella buy a seat?

34
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.393
Yeah, that's right.
Just a little bit ago.

35
00:05:50.437 --> 00:05:51.829
Says you.

36
00:05:54.179 --> 00:05:55.920
Throw me down them shackles.

37
00:05:56.747 --> 00:05:57.922
All right.

38
00:06:05.321 --> 00:06:07.367
You got papers?

39
00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:08.542
I'm free.

40
00:06:13.721 --> 00:06:16.376
Irregardless of what you say,

41
00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:18.378
you still gotta
show us your papers.

42
00:06:19.857 --> 00:06:20.989
Come on now.
I ain't got all day.

43
00:06:21.032 --> 00:06:22.469
Don't make me ask twice.

44
00:06:31.478 --> 00:06:33.480
"Mo..."

45
00:06:35.177 --> 00:06:36.570
Washington.

46
00:06:36.613 --> 00:06:37.701
Washington.

47
00:06:37.745 --> 00:06:39.529
Washington? Ha-ha.

48
00:06:41.096 --> 00:06:43.707
What an honorable appellation.

49
00:06:46.318 --> 00:06:47.929
You carryin'?

50
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:50.671
Give it.

51
00:06:57.591 --> 00:07:00.463
Now, you might have
passage on this trip,

52
00:07:00.507 --> 00:07:03.292
but there ain't nothin' says
I got to have you at my back,

53
00:07:03.335 --> 00:07:04.467
gun at the ready.

54
00:07:06.338 --> 00:07:08.123
Well, what you got
in that case?

55
00:07:10.691 --> 00:07:12.301
Bible and some dried meat.

56
00:07:19.526 --> 00:07:22.224
Hey.
Fat boy, wake up.

57
00:07:25.357 --> 00:07:27.359
There's a luggage seat
in the back.

58
00:07:28.186 --> 00:07:30.450
Is that a man or a boy?

59
00:07:33.278 --> 00:07:36.281
Well, which would
you prefer, madam?

60
00:07:51.993 --> 00:07:53.124
Curly.

61
00:07:55.257 --> 00:07:56.998
Do you need my gun too?

62
00:07:57.041 --> 00:07:59.000
Of course not, Mr. Wheeler.

63
00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:13.667
Let's go.

64
00:08:18.933 --> 00:08:22.327
All right, stage for
Colorado's leavin'. Let's go.

65
00:08:24.982 --> 00:08:28.856
Lord, just get me
from here to there.

66
00:09:05.414 --> 00:09:06.676
Ma'am.

67
00:09:07.198 --> 00:09:08.243
Madam.

68
00:09:09.418 --> 00:09:12.595
Claude Aloysius Fields,
at your service.

69
00:09:12.639 --> 00:09:15.163
The Ol' Wildcat from Kentucky.

70
00:09:16.643 --> 00:09:18.949
You see? That's me.

71
00:09:54.332 --> 00:09:55.986
"Territory of Colorado

72
00:09:57.597 --> 00:10:00.208
"hereby grants
to Mo Washington,

73
00:10:03.124 --> 00:10:04.995
"ownership of this land."

74
00:10:26.234 --> 00:10:27.975
Let's go, Andy.
Let's go, buddy.

75
00:10:28.018 --> 00:10:29.106
All right. I'm comin'.

76
00:10:46.384 --> 00:10:47.951
I talked to Curly.

77
00:10:48.822 --> 00:10:50.301
Thought you might need this.

78
00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:54.131
I seen rattlers out here
bigger than you.

79
00:10:57.308 --> 00:10:59.397
This is a fine Remington.

80
00:10:59.441 --> 00:11:00.442
Lot of power.

81
00:11:02.531 --> 00:11:04.315
Needed something
easy to handle.

82
00:11:05.795 --> 00:11:07.797
Can't shoot a dead buffalo.

83
00:11:14.543 --> 00:11:16.676
Quite a few notches
in your handle here.

84
00:11:33.693 --> 00:11:35.477
You got family out here?

85
00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:40.612
No, sir.

86
00:11:40.656 --> 00:11:42.092
Just passin' through.

87
00:11:43.485 --> 00:11:44.660
Headed west.

88
00:11:46.444 --> 00:11:48.316
Just lookin' for a new start.

89
00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:53.713
You?

90
00:11:55.976 --> 00:11:57.281
Wife and daughter.

91
00:11:58.369 --> 00:11:59.675
They're home.

92
00:12:01.764 --> 00:12:03.374
Missus is expectin'.

93
00:12:05.115 --> 00:12:06.508
Any day now.

94
00:12:09.076 --> 00:12:11.295
I don't like
leavin' them alone.

95
00:12:18.346 --> 00:12:20.043
I'll need it back
in the mornin'.

96
00:12:55.862 --> 00:12:57.994
Andy, go help the lady.

97
00:12:59.169 --> 00:13:00.823
What are you laughing at?

98
00:13:05.959 --> 00:13:07.569
Do you feel
relieved, Madam?

99
00:13:07.612 --> 00:13:10.311
Do you never shut up?

100
00:13:58.098 --> 00:13:59.142
Let's flank 'em.

101
00:13:59.186 --> 00:14:00.709
To the right! To the right!

102
00:14:04.147 --> 00:14:05.670
Shit.

103
00:14:14.636 --> 00:14:16.638
Hold up! Hold up!

104
00:14:16.681 --> 00:14:18.596
Drop the rifle!

105
00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:20.294
Hold up! Hold up!

106
00:14:22.557 --> 00:14:24.167
Get 'em out.

107
00:14:25.299 --> 00:14:26.300
What's happening?

108
00:14:26.778 --> 00:14:28.041
Road agents.

109
00:14:28.563 --> 00:14:29.956
Road agents?

110
00:14:30.695 --> 00:14:32.654
Marauders.

111
00:14:37.137 --> 00:14:39.269
Hands where
I can see 'em, cowboy.

112
00:14:45.928 --> 00:14:46.973
Ain't you gonna shoot 'em?

113
00:14:47.016 --> 00:14:49.714
I do, they take us all out.

114
00:14:49.758 --> 00:14:53.631
If they push for a last stand,
they'll get one.

115
00:14:55.982 --> 00:14:58.245
Just be glad
they're not Indians.

116
00:14:58.288 --> 00:15:00.116
Nobody make
no sudden moves.

117
00:15:06.035 --> 00:15:07.776
Now, we don't need
anyone getting hurt.

118
00:15:09.778 --> 00:15:11.911
All right,
you boys know what to do.

119
00:15:19.527 --> 00:15:21.355
Tommy, what about the money?

120
00:15:21.398 --> 00:15:22.660
Don't fuckin' touch me.

121
00:15:22.704 --> 00:15:24.010
Tommy!

122
00:15:24.053 --> 00:15:26.316
We, uh...
We ain't got nothing of value.

123
00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.970
We ain't got no mail, no gold.

124
00:15:28.014 --> 00:15:30.146
Just what
the passengers brought.

125
00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:32.757
If I want it, it has value.

126
00:15:32.801 --> 00:15:35.108
Now, let me see y'all's hands.

127
00:15:35.151 --> 00:15:38.285
Huh. You're Tommy Walsh.

128
00:15:41.723 --> 00:15:43.116
Tommy Walsh?

129
00:15:44.813 --> 00:15:47.163
The bank robber, Tommy Walsh?

130
00:15:49.992 --> 00:15:52.081
Let's see
what you got, folks.

131
00:15:52.125 --> 00:15:54.954
We'll all be on our merry way.

132
00:15:55.606 --> 00:15:56.999
Out! Out!

133
00:15:57.043 --> 00:15:58.783
Come on out
and stretch your legs.

134
00:16:00.568 --> 00:16:02.091
You too, chuckaboo.

135
00:16:02.135 --> 00:16:05.790
Your presence is requested
forthwith, Madam.

136
00:16:05.834 --> 00:16:07.836
I'm not moving from this spot.

137
00:16:07.879 --> 00:16:09.055
Suit yourself.

138
00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:16.149
All right,
come on now, folks.

139
00:16:26.028 --> 00:16:28.074
Take it easy.
I got all the horses.

140
00:16:29.423 --> 00:16:31.860
Well,
do what you gotta do,

141
00:16:31.903 --> 00:16:33.688
but do it real careful.

142
00:16:38.171 --> 00:16:39.259
Join us.

143
00:16:42.871 --> 00:16:44.307
We're all equals here.

144
00:16:44.351 --> 00:16:46.048
Everybody out.

145
00:16:46.092 --> 00:16:47.919
I'd do as they say, ma'am.

146
00:16:51.401 --> 00:16:53.142
Get on down.

147
00:16:55.318 --> 00:16:57.277
All right, gentlemen,
let's, uh...

148
00:16:58.234 --> 00:17:00.715
let's have a peek
at them billfolds.

149
00:17:01.716 --> 00:17:02.934
Thank you, sir.

150
00:17:02.978 --> 00:17:04.675
Much obliged.

151
00:17:06.373 --> 00:17:07.765
That'll do.

152
00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:18.080
There ain't shit
up here.

153
00:17:18.124 --> 00:17:19.299
Just throw all that shit away.

154
00:17:19.342 --> 00:17:20.387
Much appreciated.

155
00:17:21.997 --> 00:17:23.520
No, it's just clothes.

156
00:17:27.307 --> 00:17:28.873
No, they ain't kiddin'.

157
00:17:28.917 --> 00:17:31.137
-There ain't nothing up here.
-Well, you take it anyway!

158
00:17:32.355 --> 00:17:33.574
Yes, sir.

159
00:17:33.617 --> 00:17:35.663
And hurry up.
Come on, gentlemen.

160
00:17:35.706 --> 00:17:37.099
Check underneath.
Check underneath.

161
00:17:37.143 --> 00:17:39.710
What about the money
from the bank, huh?

162
00:17:39.754 --> 00:17:41.103
No,
there ain't nothing here.

163
00:17:41.147 --> 00:17:43.062
Muchas gracias.

164
00:17:45.934 --> 00:17:47.283
How about you, amigo?

165
00:17:47.327 --> 00:17:48.502
What you got?

166
00:17:51.157 --> 00:17:52.941
Couple of coins
in here. That's it.

167
00:17:52.984 --> 00:17:54.812
All right,
pack them up.

168
00:18:01.906 --> 00:18:03.430
What the hell?

169
00:18:03.473 --> 00:18:04.996
Thunderation.

170
00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.172
My apologies, gentlemen.

171
00:18:06.215 --> 00:18:09.044
No need to alarm you.

172
00:18:09.088 --> 00:18:12.047
I don't know,
it appears that...

173
00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:13.701
There seems to be
something wrong

174
00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:17.052
with my ticker.

175
00:18:29.456 --> 00:18:31.632
Oh, shit!

176
00:18:35.984 --> 00:18:37.725
Come on,
give me a hand.

177
00:18:37.768 --> 00:18:39.248
Get away from me!

178
00:18:41.729 --> 00:18:44.123
I'll murder you.

179
00:18:55.003 --> 00:18:56.570
Get off me!

180
00:19:09.104 --> 00:19:10.149
Brogan!

181
00:19:27.731 --> 00:19:28.906
Hey!

182
00:19:48.448 --> 00:19:49.840
Take my hand.
Take it quick.

183
00:19:49.884 --> 00:19:52.495
- Come on and jump!
- I can't, I can't jump.

184
00:19:52.539 --> 00:19:53.670
Please, take my hand.

185
00:19:56.325 --> 00:19:57.761
- I can't, I can't!
- Jump!

186
00:19:57.805 --> 00:19:59.328
I can't.

187
00:20:37.018 --> 00:20:38.367
Son of a bitch!

188
00:20:38.411 --> 00:20:39.412
Hey, kid!

189
00:20:45.853 --> 00:20:47.637
That hurts!

190
00:20:48.334 --> 00:20:49.335
Son of a bitch.

191
00:20:51.511 --> 00:20:52.599
Kid, shoot him!

192
00:20:53.469 --> 00:20:54.644
Shoot him!

193
00:21:08.441 --> 00:21:09.485
Get up.

194
00:21:29.244 --> 00:21:30.332
Careful of this.

195
00:21:35.163 --> 00:21:37.426
Look out!

196
00:21:43.476 --> 00:21:44.694
You're a good shot.

197
00:21:46.217 --> 00:21:47.523
Stay with me.

198
00:21:49.351 --> 00:21:51.962
- See that tree right there?
- Huh? Uh-huh.

199
00:22:59.726 --> 00:23:01.815
Oh, my God!

200
00:23:02.642 --> 00:23:05.514
Tommy! Tommy!

201
00:23:05.558 --> 00:23:07.647
They got Brogan, bad!

202
00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:10.867
He's dying, Tommy.

203
00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:16.046
Give yourself up,
we can get him to a doctor.

204
00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:17.744
What do I do?

205
00:23:17.787 --> 00:23:20.224
Heck,
you know what to do!

206
00:23:20.268 --> 00:23:21.617
Now you do it!

207
00:23:23.271 --> 00:23:25.099
It's on you, Tommy.

208
00:23:30.147 --> 00:23:32.280
You go and gather up
the boys now.

209
00:23:34.021 --> 00:23:36.458
Don't tell 'em
where the money's at.

210
00:23:37.981 --> 00:23:39.722
You just gather the boys!

211
00:24:18.892 --> 00:24:20.502
That's just
the start of it.

212
00:24:22.199 --> 00:24:23.462
Get up.

213
00:24:23.505 --> 00:24:24.463
Get up!

214
00:24:29.337 --> 00:24:31.295
Get him over here,
Curly. Quit it.

215
00:24:31.339 --> 00:24:33.167
Come on! Get him up.

216
00:24:35.952 --> 00:24:37.388
Boy, you better lower that gun

217
00:24:37.432 --> 00:24:39.303
if you don't wanna wind up
on the wrong end of it.

218
00:24:40.043 --> 00:24:41.436
Get him over here.

219
00:24:44.047 --> 00:24:46.310
Easy now, Curly. Easy now.

220
00:24:46.354 --> 00:24:47.486
Come help me.

221
00:24:47.529 --> 00:24:49.270
Come help me.

222
00:24:54.188 --> 00:24:57.191
He ain't got
the rights to do this to me.

223
00:24:58.366 --> 00:25:00.150
You cockroaches killed Andy.

224
00:25:00.194 --> 00:25:02.196
And you wanna
talk to me about rights?

225
00:25:02.239 --> 00:25:04.111
Curly!

226
00:25:04.154 --> 00:25:06.243
You kill him, you hang.

227
00:25:06.287 --> 00:25:08.289
There ain't a court
that'd convict me.

228
00:25:08.332 --> 00:25:10.117
They would
after I have my say.

229
00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:11.945
Now put that gun down.

230
00:25:17.646 --> 00:25:19.518
I'll trust you
to keep it down.

231
00:25:21.911 --> 00:25:23.739
All right...

232
00:25:23.783 --> 00:25:26.133
Mr. Fields, we're gonna get
you to a doctor soon enough.

233
00:25:26.176 --> 00:25:27.526
There's one
back in Brushwood Gulch.

234
00:25:27.569 --> 00:25:29.484
All right.

235
00:25:29.528 --> 00:25:30.659
All right,

236
00:25:30.703 --> 00:25:32.182
first things first.

237
00:25:32.226 --> 00:25:34.228
Go gather your team
and your stagecoach.

238
00:25:35.664 --> 00:25:37.361
Stage went
over the cliff, sir.

239
00:25:38.232 --> 00:25:39.668
With the woman inside?

240
00:25:42.497 --> 00:25:44.325
What about my horses?

241
00:25:44.368 --> 00:25:45.500
They scattered.

242
00:25:46.109 --> 00:25:48.242
G... God damn it!

243
00:25:48.982 --> 00:25:50.897
God damn it.

244
00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:52.681
This is
what we're gonna do.

245
00:25:53.726 --> 00:25:57.294
Curly, you're gonna
grab a horse.

246
00:25:57.338 --> 00:26:00.863
You're gonna ride
Mr. Fields to a doctor.

247
00:26:00.907 --> 00:26:03.562
I'm gonna take the mountain
pass to Wagon Gap.

248
00:26:03.605 --> 00:26:06.521
I'm gonna get the sheriff and
a posse and bring 'em here.

249
00:26:06.565 --> 00:26:08.523
What about this piece of shit?

250
00:26:11.221 --> 00:26:13.136
I'm gonna tie him
to this here tree.

251
00:26:14.529 --> 00:26:16.052
He'll stand guard.

252
00:26:16.966 --> 00:26:18.620
Him?

253
00:26:18.664 --> 00:26:20.579
This beanpole? Guard him?

254
00:26:22.276 --> 00:26:23.973
That's Tommy Walsh, you know.

255
00:26:24.017 --> 00:26:26.149
He can handle himself.

256
00:26:26.193 --> 00:26:28.804
Now go get somethin'
to tie him with. Go on.

257
00:26:28.848 --> 00:26:30.240
God damn it.

258
00:26:30.284 --> 00:26:32.460
Corral my goods
if you please, sir.

259
00:26:32.503 --> 00:26:33.809
Yes, sir.

260
00:26:42.078 --> 00:26:43.993
This is gonna be
one hell of a night.

261
00:26:53.612 --> 00:26:56.136
I'm sorry about
your stagecoach driver.

262
00:26:57.441 --> 00:26:58.747
You get smart with me?

263
00:26:58.791 --> 00:26:59.879
Let's see how smart you are

264
00:26:59.922 --> 00:27:02.055
dancin' from the end
of a rope.

265
00:27:04.318 --> 00:27:05.362
Jesus.

266
00:27:11.281 --> 00:27:12.674
Stop! Stop!

267
00:27:12.718 --> 00:27:14.850
Stop fuckin' movin'! Now!

268
00:27:17.505 --> 00:27:19.420
All right, now listen to me.

269
00:27:19.463 --> 00:27:21.161
I've had enough
of these cheap shots.

270
00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:23.685
I did the honorable thing.

271
00:27:23.729 --> 00:27:25.078
I gave myself up.

272
00:27:25.121 --> 00:27:26.688
I've been nothin' but calm,
courteous, and kind,

273
00:27:26.732 --> 00:27:28.559
and I expect a measure
of the same, that's all.

274
00:27:30.431 --> 00:27:31.867
Or is that too much to ask?

275
00:27:32.868 --> 00:27:35.001
Let him go
or I'll put you down.

276
00:27:35.044 --> 00:27:37.786
Yeah, well...

277
00:27:39.745 --> 00:27:41.050
Well, no one's gonna find
where I hid

278
00:27:41.094 --> 00:27:43.009
that stolen bank loot,
now, are they?

279
00:27:45.925 --> 00:27:47.578
Some prices are worth payin'.

280
00:27:58.589 --> 00:28:00.156
- God damn it.
- Ease off.

281
00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:01.418
I will kill
that son of a bitch.

282
00:28:01.462 --> 00:28:03.333
Finish tyin' him.
Come on, now!

283
00:28:03.377 --> 00:28:04.378
Get a move on.

284
00:28:06.249 --> 00:28:07.729
- Dear God.
- Now I'm playin' with you.

285
00:28:07.773 --> 00:28:08.991
Come on.

286
00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:13.909
Go get the horses.

287
00:28:25.355 --> 00:28:26.835
He's bleedin' real bad.

288
00:28:30.012 --> 00:28:32.058
You need to put
more pressure on it.

289
00:28:32.101 --> 00:28:34.234
He's gonna bleed out.

290
00:28:34.277 --> 00:28:37.846
Get your ass back on that tree
or I'll end you, son!

291
00:28:40.022 --> 00:28:41.763
All right, we're gonna get
you on that horse, okay?

292
00:28:41.807 --> 00:28:43.069
All right.

293
00:28:43.112 --> 00:28:44.157
Come on.

294
00:28:46.376 --> 00:28:49.031
Oh, the, um...

295
00:28:49.075 --> 00:28:51.512
The blue bottle,
if you please, sir.

296
00:28:51.555 --> 00:28:52.600
Yes, sir.

297
00:29:00.086 --> 00:29:02.001
My own personal supply.

298
00:29:05.395 --> 00:29:06.396
Very good.

299
00:29:15.057 --> 00:29:18.408
It was a pleasure making your
acquaintance, Mr. Walsh.

300
00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:30.116
Night's comin'.

301
00:29:30.725 --> 00:29:32.335
So is the cold.

302
00:29:34.598 --> 00:29:36.035
You'll need these.

303
00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:44.434
Best you gather up some wood
before night.

304
00:29:44.478 --> 00:29:46.306
And you might need this too.

305
00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:49.352
For rattlers.

306
00:30:02.409 --> 00:30:04.106
Last thing.

307
00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:07.283
He's got a $10,000 bounty
on his head.

308
00:30:07.327 --> 00:30:10.852
When we come back,
and he's gone or dead,

309
00:30:10.896 --> 00:30:15.204
well, there'll be
a hanging either way.

310
00:30:15.248 --> 00:30:16.423
You understand?

311
00:30:22.342 --> 00:30:23.691
God damn it.

312
00:30:39.533 --> 00:30:40.621
Well,

313
00:30:43.276 --> 00:30:44.407
here we are.

314
00:30:46.975 --> 00:30:48.847
Coyote and a horse.

315
00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:18.197
That's some expert
marksmanship right there.

316
00:32:25.247 --> 00:32:29.382
You know, you should dig up
whoever's rottin' over there.

317
00:32:29.425 --> 00:32:31.514
Give yourself another
bodyguard, I don't know...

318
00:32:32.907 --> 00:32:35.779
Maybe enough of 'em
will frighten away my men.

319
00:32:36.955 --> 00:32:40.610
Point is, my men are comin'.

320
00:32:40.654 --> 00:32:44.005
Now, you'll think it's a call
of a bird or rustle of a deer.

321
00:32:44.049 --> 00:32:45.050
That's them comin'.

322
00:32:46.747 --> 00:32:49.619
Well, they're gonna
tear you apart and eat ya.

323
00:32:53.406 --> 00:32:55.669
You know, those white folk
ain't comin' back.

324
00:32:57.671 --> 00:32:59.978
You run away,
they'll just hunt you down.

325
00:33:01.066 --> 00:33:02.545
You got nowhere to go.

326
00:33:03.633 --> 00:33:07.202
You and me,
we're stuck together now.

327
00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:10.292
They left you to the wolves.

328
00:33:11.772 --> 00:33:12.991
The dark is comin'.

329
00:33:33.315 --> 00:33:35.143
You fuckin' give me
those keys now.

330
00:33:37.232 --> 00:33:39.191
Give me
those fuckin' keys now!

331
00:33:43.717 --> 00:33:45.197
These keys right here?

332
00:33:47.503 --> 00:33:48.765
I want the keys.

333
00:33:48.809 --> 00:33:49.810
All right.

334
00:34:02.388 --> 00:34:03.824
White boy.

335
00:34:05.956 --> 00:34:08.263
Don't you ever, in your life,
put your hands on me.

336
00:34:11.049 --> 00:34:13.703
Don't ever put your hands
on me again.

337
00:34:13.747 --> 00:34:15.270
Don't even attempt it.

338
00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:47.041
You know,
I fought for your kind.

339
00:34:48.216 --> 00:34:49.652
In the war.

340
00:34:49.696 --> 00:34:50.871
My kind?

341
00:34:52.046 --> 00:34:54.788
I was at Fort Wagner.

342
00:34:54.831 --> 00:34:56.050
I fought shoulder to shoulder

343
00:34:56.094 --> 00:34:58.139
with the Massachusetts
Colored Regiment.

344
00:34:58.183 --> 00:34:59.706
I was there.

345
00:34:59.749 --> 00:35:00.924
Bullshit.

346
00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:03.840
You know, I never understood

347
00:35:03.884 --> 00:35:05.799
why your people
just accepted it.

348
00:35:07.148 --> 00:35:10.499
Why they just didn't rise up
and burn the world down.

349
00:35:10.543 --> 00:35:12.501
White boy,
you the one in chains.

350
00:35:19.465 --> 00:35:20.596
You think them heroes

351
00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:21.858
are gonna share
my bounty with you?

352
00:35:21.902 --> 00:35:23.208
I don't think so.

353
00:35:23.251 --> 00:35:25.906
Hell no, you're here
under threat of hanging.

354
00:35:28.735 --> 00:35:30.215
You're sure hoping
they don't discover

355
00:35:30.258 --> 00:35:31.868
what's in your britches.

356
00:35:34.262 --> 00:35:36.221
Did you hear what I said?

357
00:35:40.181 --> 00:35:42.792
Did you hear what I said?

358
00:35:42.836 --> 00:35:44.403
How you feel about that, huh?

359
00:35:46.709 --> 00:35:48.015
Just 'cause they don't
wanna look at you

360
00:35:48.058 --> 00:35:50.278
don't mean I can't see.

361
00:35:51.366 --> 00:35:52.367
Miss!

362
00:35:53.803 --> 00:35:56.415
Missus? I don't know
what you want me to call you!

363
00:35:57.155 --> 00:35:58.808
You're a sideshow freak!

364
00:36:01.159 --> 00:36:02.421
Now, I won't
fuckin' stand for this.

365
00:36:02.464 --> 00:36:04.466
I'm Tommy fuckin' Walsh!

366
00:36:06.381 --> 00:36:08.688
Now, this is bullshit!
You let me go!

367
00:36:10.429 --> 00:36:12.082
Come on,
you think you're innocent?

368
00:36:12.126 --> 00:36:13.823
I don't think so.

369
00:36:13.867 --> 00:36:15.738
You sittin' on the back
of that wagon

370
00:36:15.782 --> 00:36:18.132
where I saw you,
without a fight,

371
00:36:18.176 --> 00:36:19.438
you know what I think?

372
00:36:19.481 --> 00:36:21.614
I think that condemns
your kind.

373
00:36:22.441 --> 00:36:23.877
How you feel about that?

374
00:36:24.921 --> 00:36:26.445
Now, you may think
that you're free.

375
00:36:26.488 --> 00:36:27.794
You may think that.

376
00:36:29.665 --> 00:36:31.754
But you'll always be a slave
to the white man's biddin'.

377
00:36:31.798 --> 00:36:32.799
That's the truth.

378
00:36:40.285 --> 00:36:42.374
What'd you call me?

379
00:36:42.417 --> 00:36:44.027
I said you'll always
be a slave...

380
00:36:44.071 --> 00:36:45.333
What'd you call me?

381
00:36:45.377 --> 00:36:46.682
I said you'll always
be a slave

382
00:36:46.726 --> 00:36:48.249
-to the white man's biddin'.
-What'd you say?

383
00:36:49.207 --> 00:36:50.643
What'd you say?

384
00:36:50.686 --> 00:36:51.861
Say it again!

385
00:36:51.905 --> 00:36:53.211
Say it again!

386
00:36:54.255 --> 00:36:56.344
Say it again.

387
00:36:56.388 --> 00:36:58.477
Tired of you running
your mouth.

388
00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:02.045
Till you been on this side,
keep your mouth shut.

389
00:37:03.743 --> 00:37:06.876
Every step, y'all wanna bring
us down like we're dyin' dogs.

390
00:37:08.313 --> 00:37:10.750
You ever see a white man
kill your folks?

391
00:37:14.406 --> 00:37:15.929
Hang a Black man from a tree

392
00:37:15.972 --> 00:37:18.236
because he's in a wrong place
at a wrong time?

393
00:37:22.022 --> 00:37:23.197
You ever see that?

394
00:37:23.241 --> 00:37:25.286
No, didn't see that.

395
00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:27.593
-No.
-Did not see that.

396
00:37:27.636 --> 00:37:29.725
Wanna see it?

397
00:37:29.769 --> 00:37:31.205
- I don't wanna see...
- You wanna see?

398
00:37:31.249 --> 00:37:32.293
I didn't see that.

399
00:37:35.949 --> 00:37:37.864
Look, there it is!

400
00:37:37.907 --> 00:37:39.953
You ever seen a Black man hang
from that tree?

401
00:37:39.996 --> 00:37:42.608
For lookin' at a white woman
he didn't look at?

402
00:37:43.783 --> 00:37:45.872
Or for tryin' to learn
how to read?

403
00:37:48.527 --> 00:37:50.180
Can't complain.

404
00:37:51.225 --> 00:37:53.314
We gotta be grateful.

405
00:37:53.358 --> 00:37:54.446
Grateful.

406
00:37:55.403 --> 00:37:57.144
Grateful!

407
00:37:57.187 --> 00:37:58.711
We gotta be grateful.

408
00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:01.409
-Grateful.
-Yes, ma'am.

409
00:38:01.453 --> 00:38:03.803
For the blisters on our hands.

410
00:38:03.846 --> 00:38:08.111
And our empty bellies,
and our broken spirits.

411
00:38:08.155 --> 00:38:10.984
'Cause they'd rather hang me
for the color of my skin

412
00:38:11.027 --> 00:38:13.726
than to hang you
for what you did!

413
00:38:13.769 --> 00:38:15.989
You ain't never gonna hang,
white boy!

414
00:38:16.032 --> 00:38:17.686
You hear me?

415
00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:20.706
I mean no offense...

416
00:39:26.929 --> 00:39:28.104
All right, get up.

417
00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:32.326
Real turtle like.

418
00:39:34.459 --> 00:39:35.895
We're goin' for a walk.

419
00:39:36.765 --> 00:39:38.114
Get my Bible,

420
00:39:39.202 --> 00:39:41.161
and find the stagecoach
that you robbed.

421
00:39:41.204 --> 00:39:42.205
Yes, ma'am.

422
00:39:51.476 --> 00:39:53.347
You know, we can't
just walk outta here.

423
00:39:54.479 --> 00:39:55.741
This is Comanche country.

424
00:39:57.046 --> 00:39:59.266
No Bible is that important.

425
00:39:59.309 --> 00:40:00.789
Keep walking.

426
00:40:33.082 --> 00:40:35.171
You've gotta
hope it don't snow.

427
00:40:36.695 --> 00:40:38.436
It's gonna dump on us.

428
00:40:40.481 --> 00:40:42.135
If it does, I'll, uh...

429
00:40:43.832 --> 00:40:45.181
I'll dig you out,

430
00:40:45.225 --> 00:40:46.574
haul you back up the hill

431
00:40:46.618 --> 00:40:48.881
and I'll bury you
by the cross back at the tree.

432
00:40:49.882 --> 00:40:51.536
So you ain't alone.

433
00:40:53.712 --> 00:40:55.191
How has nobody taken a bullet

434
00:40:55.235 --> 00:40:58.499
and put it through your throat
to shut you up?

435
00:40:58.543 --> 00:41:00.414
They've tried,
and they're gonna try again.

436
00:41:01.502 --> 00:41:02.721
But, uh...

437
00:41:02.764 --> 00:41:05.114
Nah, the thing
of being a hero...

438
00:41:05.158 --> 00:41:07.421
You know,
about the main thing,

439
00:41:07.465 --> 00:41:09.249
we ought to know when to die.

440
00:41:09.292 --> 00:41:11.164
Prolonged life...

441
00:41:11.207 --> 00:41:13.209
It's ruined more men
than it ever made.

442
00:41:18.258 --> 00:41:19.694
Hey!

443
00:41:25.483 --> 00:41:27.485
I do hope you find your Bible.

444
00:41:29.574 --> 00:41:31.532
I can see it means
somethin' to you.

445
00:41:35.493 --> 00:41:36.581
Know any hymns?

446
00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:42.195
Oh, sister

447
00:41:42.238 --> 00:41:45.154
 Let's go down

448
00:41:45.198 --> 00:41:47.853
 Let's go down

449
00:41:47.896 --> 00:41:50.333
 Come on down

450
00:41:51.944 --> 00:41:54.947
 Oh, sister

451
00:41:55.991 --> 00:41:58.211
 Let's go down

452
00:42:00.343 --> 00:42:03.608
 Down to the river to pray

453
00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:08.613
 Oh, sinner

454
00:42:08.656 --> 00:42:11.050
 Let's go down

455
00:42:11.833 --> 00:42:13.487
 Let's go down

456
00:42:14.096 --> 00:42:16.577
 Come on down

457
00:42:16.621 --> 00:42:19.101
-Hey! Hey!
-Oh, sinner

458
00:42:20.929 --> 00:42:21.974
Come back here!

459
00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:26.500
Come back here!

460
00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:29.111
Hey!

461
00:42:39.034 --> 00:42:40.732
Shit.

462
00:43:48.887 --> 00:43:49.931
Take it easy now.

463
00:43:51.237 --> 00:43:53.152
He means it.
I think he means it.

464
00:43:56.329 --> 00:43:57.373
I think he means it.

465
00:43:57.417 --> 00:43:58.679
I think he means it now.

466
00:43:58.723 --> 00:43:59.811
He means it.

467
00:43:59.854 --> 00:44:01.073
What the hell you doing, girl?

468
00:44:01.116 --> 00:44:02.161
Shoot him!

469
00:47:45.123 --> 00:47:47.168
You gonna tell me
what that paper was?

470
00:47:49.170 --> 00:47:50.563
Now that it's gone?

471
00:48:00.529 --> 00:48:01.791
Gold claim.

472
00:48:05.186 --> 00:48:08.407
Piece of land I had
to build a town for my people.

473
00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:09.756
A gold claim?

474
00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:12.890
Who'd you kill for that?

475
00:48:15.762 --> 00:48:19.026
I wanna understand how
a woman, such as yourself...

476
00:48:19.070 --> 00:48:20.549
Black woman.

477
00:48:20.593 --> 00:48:21.942
Yeah.

478
00:48:21.986 --> 00:48:23.596
Who's hiding as a man

479
00:48:25.467 --> 00:48:27.339
just buys a gold claim.

480
00:48:28.122 --> 00:48:29.471
How's that possible?

481
00:48:33.736 --> 00:48:37.218
After the war, I couldn't find
none of my family but my mom.

482
00:48:39.003 --> 00:48:40.830
She went home to be with God.

483
00:48:41.831 --> 00:48:43.529
Find peace in death.

484
00:48:44.878 --> 00:48:47.576
Made a promise in my heart
that I'll honor her.

485
00:48:50.275 --> 00:48:53.887
Fight for those that can't
fight for themselves.

486
00:48:53.931 --> 00:48:55.019
Where's your getaway?

487
00:48:55.062 --> 00:48:56.542
You goin' home?

488
00:48:56.585 --> 00:48:58.805
I wasn't gonna go back
to my master's house,

489
00:48:58.848 --> 00:49:01.025
that's for sure.

490
00:49:01.068 --> 00:49:02.940
So I put two and two together,
and just figured

491
00:49:02.983 --> 00:49:04.854
that I'll go cook and clean

492
00:49:04.898 --> 00:49:07.640
for them Union boys
that set me free.

493
00:49:13.602 --> 00:49:15.953
I spent four years
watching them soldiers.

494
00:49:18.172 --> 00:49:20.435
How they walk, how they talk.

495
00:49:23.221 --> 00:49:25.527
Learnt everything I needed
to know about them.

496
00:49:27.529 --> 00:49:30.054
When they needed
people to sign up,

497
00:49:30.097 --> 00:49:32.317
I just cut my hair,
bought some clothes,

498
00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:34.275
and walked on
to the army base.

499
00:49:36.103 --> 00:49:38.366
Guess nobody was
paying attention that day...

500
00:49:41.717 --> 00:49:44.068
and signed up
and picked up a uniform.

501
00:49:47.985 --> 00:49:50.770
Uniform made me feel free.

502
00:49:50.813 --> 00:49:53.207
I ain't never been that free
in my whole life.

503
00:49:55.209 --> 00:49:59.170
I had food, clothing,
money in my pocket.

504
00:50:02.216 --> 00:50:05.350
Soon enough, they sent us
out here to kill people

505
00:50:05.393 --> 00:50:08.048
that are couple shades
lighter than me.

506
00:50:08.092 --> 00:50:09.832
So I left.

507
00:50:09.876 --> 00:50:12.052
Took my money
and bought that claim.

508
00:50:15.273 --> 00:50:18.232
Lot of folks was depending
on that claim.

509
00:50:22.541 --> 00:50:24.021
You know, I knew it.

510
00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:29.548
You have that look
of a soldier.

511
00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:33.421
That look of not being able
to unsee things.

512
00:50:35.858 --> 00:50:38.687
I had never met no white boy
that could speak Comanche.

513
00:50:44.128 --> 00:50:45.651
My wife was Injun.

514
00:50:48.654 --> 00:50:49.785
Your wife was what?

515
00:50:49.829 --> 00:50:51.700
My wife was Injun.

516
00:50:57.445 --> 00:50:59.056
-You got a wife?
-Had.

517
00:51:03.538 --> 00:51:05.975
I had a kid, too.

518
00:51:10.241 --> 00:51:12.156
You know, humankind, uh,

519
00:51:13.374 --> 00:51:14.810
can be awfully unkind

520
00:51:14.854 --> 00:51:16.508
if it deems
that you don't belong.

521
00:51:20.077 --> 00:51:22.601
So now, you wanna
take revenge on the world?

522
00:51:25.821 --> 00:51:26.909
Well...

523
00:51:28.476 --> 00:51:31.784
I've been out for revenge on
the world since I was eight.

524
00:51:31.827 --> 00:51:33.742
Yeah.

525
00:51:33.786 --> 00:51:35.092
Cattle barons.

526
00:51:36.441 --> 00:51:37.659
They came in, they took

527
00:51:37.703 --> 00:51:38.965
my dad and brother
from the dinner table.

528
00:51:39.008 --> 00:51:40.749
They shot 'em
'cause they wanted our land.

529
00:51:46.059 --> 00:51:47.452
It's how I got this.

530
00:51:51.586 --> 00:51:53.197
Made Ma sign it over
right there

531
00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:55.373
before we even finished
saying the blessing.

532
00:51:57.331 --> 00:51:59.333
I know we all got
bad stories to tell,

533
00:51:59.377 --> 00:52:02.293
but not everybody takes it out
on the world like you.

534
00:52:05.122 --> 00:52:07.820
"An eye for an eye,"
that's what I say.

535
00:52:15.436 --> 00:52:17.134
You know,

536
00:52:19.614 --> 00:52:21.921
it looks like we believe
in the same thing.

537
00:52:27.231 --> 00:52:28.667
I guess so.

538
00:52:30.538 --> 00:52:33.498
We just go about it
in different ways.

539
00:52:33.541 --> 00:52:35.543
Let's go about it together.

540
00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:40.983
Now, since your gold
is gone,

541
00:52:42.724 --> 00:52:45.466
how about we strike a deal?

542
00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:47.468
Now, you see,
that loot from the bank...

543
00:52:50.079 --> 00:52:52.647
I'm the only one
who knows where it is.

544
00:52:55.128 --> 00:52:56.477
You let me go.

545
00:52:56.521 --> 00:52:57.870
I dig it up.

546
00:52:59.132 --> 00:53:01.090
We split it
right down the middle.

547
00:53:03.136 --> 00:53:04.224
Right down the middle.

548
00:53:07.967 --> 00:53:09.838
White boy, you crazy.

549
00:53:10.448 --> 00:53:11.492
That's dirty money.

550
00:53:11.536 --> 00:53:12.754
Oh, come on,
all money's dirty.

551
00:53:12.798 --> 00:53:14.408
All money's dirty.

552
00:53:14.452 --> 00:53:16.671
That's not what it's about.

553
00:53:17.933 --> 00:53:19.631
It's about bein' free.

554
00:53:21.110 --> 00:53:23.025
You think money
makes you free?

555
00:53:25.289 --> 00:53:28.640
What is it to gain the whole
world but lose your soul?

556
00:53:29.945 --> 00:53:31.556
Being free is having faith.

557
00:53:31.599 --> 00:53:33.558
-My faith is my freedom.
-Oh, no, come on.

558
00:53:33.601 --> 00:53:35.212
Come on, come on.

559
00:53:35.255 --> 00:53:37.257
No.

560
00:53:37.301 --> 00:53:39.738
That's just more people
telling you what to do,

561
00:53:39.781 --> 00:53:41.870
telling you how to think,
all the time.

562
00:53:41.914 --> 00:53:43.394
Always, always.

563
00:53:43.437 --> 00:53:45.613
You can't do nothin'.

564
00:53:45.657 --> 00:53:47.833
That's all it is.

565
00:53:47.876 --> 00:53:49.313
Money!

566
00:53:51.793 --> 00:53:53.099
Money.

567
00:53:55.406 --> 00:53:58.713
No matter
how much money you get,

568
00:53:58.757 --> 00:54:02.413
your heart's gonna still be
in the same place.

569
00:54:02.761 --> 00:54:03.979
Lonely,

570
00:54:04.328 --> 00:54:05.590
sad,

571
00:54:06.373 --> 00:54:07.592
broken.

572
00:54:09.637 --> 00:54:11.900
You ain't never gonna be free
on the inside.

573
00:54:13.989 --> 00:54:15.948
That's when you know
you're free.

574
00:54:19.386 --> 00:54:22.171
We... Listen to me now.

575
00:54:22.215 --> 00:54:25.087
Mo. You listen to me now.

576
00:54:25.131 --> 00:54:26.263
We deserve it.

577
00:54:27.699 --> 00:54:29.048
I'm listenin' to you.

578
00:54:29.091 --> 00:54:30.702
-Why should I trust you?
-I'm listenin' to you.

579
00:54:30.745 --> 00:54:32.051
-Why should I trust you?
-Listen.

580
00:54:32.094 --> 00:54:34.053
Look at the shit
that we've been through.

581
00:54:36.185 --> 00:54:38.449
Don't you think
we fuckin' deserve it?

582
00:54:42.801 --> 00:54:43.845
It's out here?

583
00:54:43.889 --> 00:54:45.194
Oh, yeah.

584
00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:48.720
It's right here,
you can see it from here.

585
00:54:50.678 --> 00:54:52.332
Imagine.

586
00:54:53.942 --> 00:54:56.771
$40,000.

587
00:54:59.948 --> 00:55:01.080
It's ours.

588
00:55:04.605 --> 00:55:06.520
You just gotta let me go.

589
00:55:12.134 --> 00:55:13.353
Show me where it is first.

590
00:55:13.397 --> 00:55:15.834
No, no, no.

591
00:55:15.877 --> 00:55:17.749
So you can shoot me in the
head and take it for yourself?

592
00:55:17.792 --> 00:55:19.664
Come on, I don't think so.

593
00:55:19.707 --> 00:55:21.666
No, no, no, no, no.

594
00:55:24.756 --> 00:55:26.801
You make a deal
with the Devil,

595
00:55:28.673 --> 00:55:31.415
you follow Devil's rules.

596
00:55:33.373 --> 00:55:35.157
Deal with the Devil?

597
00:55:35.201 --> 00:55:36.985
That's right. You and me.

598
00:55:38.422 --> 00:55:39.901
You and me.

599
00:55:41.163 --> 00:55:43.296
I don't make
those kind of deals.

600
00:55:48.475 --> 00:55:49.476
Hello?

601
00:55:51.173 --> 00:55:52.827
Who's out there?

602
00:55:54.742 --> 00:55:56.265
Hey, you come on now.
You show yourself!

603
00:55:56.309 --> 00:55:57.397
Shut up.

604
00:55:57.441 --> 00:55:59.268
Come on.
Come here.

605
00:56:01.836 --> 00:56:03.664
-Those your boys? Huh?
-They are not my boys.

606
00:56:03.708 --> 00:56:05.492
They never walk up
just flappin' their jaws.

607
00:56:05.536 --> 00:56:07.015
Hello?

608
00:56:07.059 --> 00:56:09.975
Just a friend.
Here to help.

609
00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:13.108
You know him?

610
00:56:13.152 --> 00:56:14.196
Do you know him?

611
00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:15.284
I never seen him before
in my life.

612
00:56:17.809 --> 00:56:19.114
Don't move.

613
00:56:26.774 --> 00:56:28.559
Gal, what you doing out here?

614
00:56:29.386 --> 00:56:30.691
Who are you?

615
00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:33.259
My name's Will Clay.

616
00:56:43.269 --> 00:56:45.314
Take your gun off and toss it.

617
00:56:45.358 --> 00:56:47.752
- Now, wait, a man's gun is...
- Take off your gun!

618
00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:53.061
Of course.

619
00:56:53.105 --> 00:56:54.672
Do it real slow.

620
00:56:55.934 --> 00:56:57.631
I'll go as slow
as I can now.

621
00:57:07.598 --> 00:57:09.730
I'm here to help, friend.

622
00:57:17.695 --> 00:57:19.740
You all right?

623
00:57:19.784 --> 00:57:21.481
That your blood?

624
00:57:24.615 --> 00:57:26.573
Ain't none of your business.

625
00:57:26.617 --> 00:57:28.488
Relax.

626
00:57:28.532 --> 00:57:32.144
Look, I was huntin' there
down by my farm

627
00:57:32.187 --> 00:57:33.537
when I ran into your people.

628
00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:36.235
They the one told me
what happened.

629
00:57:36.278 --> 00:57:40.457
I just grabbed two of my horse
and set out to help.

630
00:57:42.197 --> 00:57:44.286
They ain't tell me nothin'
about no gal, though.

631
00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:49.770
You got them white folk
thinkin' you a man.

632
00:57:54.819 --> 00:57:58.692
The man that got shot,
he all right?

633
00:58:00.172 --> 00:58:01.913
The big one
taking care of him.

634
00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:04.698
I think he'll make it.

635
00:58:04.742 --> 00:58:07.527
You don't look dressed
for buck huntin'.

636
00:58:07.571 --> 00:58:10.051
You don't look dressed for
buck huntin' or even farmin'.

637
00:58:10.878 --> 00:58:12.227
Yeah, you got me there.

638
00:58:12.271 --> 00:58:14.621
Yeah, I do.

639
00:58:14.665 --> 00:58:17.102
Embarrassed to admit it,
but truth is, uh,

640
00:58:17.145 --> 00:58:18.712
I changed my clothes

641
00:58:18.756 --> 00:58:22.281
when I heard you was bringin'
in the infamous Tommy Walsh.

642
00:58:23.282 --> 00:58:26.503
Hmm. That's him, ain't it?

643
00:58:26.546 --> 00:58:31.377
I, uh, thought somebody might
be here to take my picture.

644
00:58:31.420 --> 00:58:32.770
I ain't never had
my picture taken before.

645
00:58:32.813 --> 00:58:34.685
Ain't no negro
farmin' around here.

646
00:58:34.728 --> 00:58:35.903
None.

647
00:58:39.037 --> 00:58:40.647
Where you from?

648
00:58:41.822 --> 00:58:44.521
He sure do ask a lot
of questions, don't he?

649
00:58:44.564 --> 00:58:46.566
I say you shoot him now,
before he takes us out.

650
00:58:46.610 --> 00:58:49.090
I'm telling you,
you shoot him now.

651
00:59:16.248 --> 00:59:17.945
Just like I thought.

652
00:59:19.643 --> 00:59:21.558
The Good Lord
done brought us together.

653
00:59:24.386 --> 00:59:26.084
Givin' you a friend
in tryin' times,

654
00:59:26.127 --> 00:59:28.565
and givin' us an opportunity.

655
00:59:29.174 --> 00:59:32.133
Opportunity?

656
00:59:32.177 --> 00:59:35.093
I bet there's a nice little
bounty on this here killer.

657
00:59:36.921 --> 00:59:38.444
Dead or alive.

658
00:59:39.706 --> 00:59:41.752
Now, I say
we put him on my horse

659
00:59:41.795 --> 00:59:42.970
and go back to the farm.

660
00:59:43.014 --> 00:59:45.538
We'll be safe there.

661
00:59:45.582 --> 00:59:48.149
I even got a brand new
can of coffee.

662
00:59:49.324 --> 00:59:51.675
We could ride off
in the morning

663
00:59:51.718 --> 00:59:52.763
and collect
the bounty together.

664
00:59:52.806 --> 00:59:53.938
Don't you trust him.

665
00:59:55.722 --> 00:59:57.115
He ain't no farmer.
He don't live around here.

666
00:59:57.158 --> 00:59:58.899
He ain't makin' no coffee.

667
00:59:59.857 --> 01:00:01.815
And since you're
the man in charge,

668
01:00:01.859 --> 01:00:03.251
you take 70%...

669
01:00:03.295 --> 01:00:04.644
God damn it, you take
these chains off of me.

670
01:00:04.688 --> 01:00:06.298
You're as dead as I am.
You listening to me?

671
01:00:07.865 --> 01:00:09.040
Can I talk to you
for a sec?

672
01:00:09.083 --> 01:00:10.215
Don't you...

673
01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:12.913
Don't you do it.

674
01:00:12.957 --> 01:00:14.698
Don't you do it.
Don't you listen to him.

675
01:00:25.317 --> 01:00:26.318
I, uh...

676
01:00:28.102 --> 01:00:31.453
I had a daughter,
about your age now.

677
01:00:37.634 --> 01:00:39.766
And if she was here...

678
01:00:44.771 --> 01:00:47.078
I would ask her
what kinda predicament

679
01:00:47.121 --> 01:00:48.775
she get herself into.

680
01:00:53.867 --> 01:00:56.087
Then, I would help
her figure a way out.

681
01:00:57.392 --> 01:01:00.700
'Cause, baby girl,
you in dangerous water,

682
01:01:00.744 --> 01:01:03.398
pushing away
the only boat you got.

683
01:01:24.115 --> 01:01:26.160
I don't know what to do.

684
01:01:27.858 --> 01:01:32.123
Well, I know he got that loot
stashed around here somewhere.

685
01:01:33.733 --> 01:01:36.780
I got ways to make him talk.

686
01:01:36.823 --> 01:01:38.956
You and I
could walk away rich.

687
01:01:38.999 --> 01:01:42.699
Be a shame to let the law put
their hands on that 120 grand.

688
01:01:44.657 --> 01:01:47.486
$120,000?

689
01:01:47.529 --> 01:01:48.748
Yes, ma'am.

690
01:01:49.749 --> 01:01:51.533
Bank got robbed same day

691
01:01:51.577 --> 01:01:54.014
the Union Pacific
deposited payroll.

692
01:01:58.149 --> 01:02:00.760
You stole $120,000?

693
01:02:01.587 --> 01:02:02.893
Hide it out here?

694
01:02:05.504 --> 01:02:07.245
You told me to trust you.

695
01:02:09.943 --> 01:02:12.380
You can't trust nobody.

696
01:02:14.818 --> 01:02:16.123
Trust me.

697
01:02:16.907 --> 01:02:18.735
Trust your own kind.

698
01:02:18.778 --> 01:02:20.737
It's all you got.

699
01:02:23.130 --> 01:02:24.828
Look...

700
01:02:28.832 --> 01:02:31.095
I'm here for a reason.

701
01:02:41.627 --> 01:02:43.803
You think that man's
gonna make it?

702
01:02:44.325 --> 01:02:46.414
Absolutely.

703
01:02:46.458 --> 01:02:47.807
Got the best doctor in town.

704
01:02:47.851 --> 01:02:49.200
What's his name?

705
01:02:49.548 --> 01:02:50.592
Woolsey.

706
01:02:52.159 --> 01:02:53.378
Come on, man.

707
01:02:54.727 --> 01:02:56.773
Woolsey, yeah.
You made that up!

708
01:02:56.816 --> 01:02:58.339
-Used to labor for him.
-Yeah, you're full of shit!

709
01:02:58.383 --> 01:02:59.427
You made it up!

710
01:02:59.471 --> 01:03:01.168
Nice fella, he is.

711
01:03:01.212 --> 01:03:02.779
Wife make the best
peach pie in town.

712
01:03:02.822 --> 01:03:05.477
God damn it!
He's fuckin' lyin' to you!

713
01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:09.263
He's a bounty hunter!

714
01:03:09.307 --> 01:03:11.396
He's gonna kill you,
he's gonna kill me,

715
01:03:11.439 --> 01:03:12.832
just like he killed
the liquor dealer

716
01:03:12.876 --> 01:03:14.616
and that big old bohunk!

717
01:03:24.801 --> 01:03:26.933
We should wait
for the sheriff.

718
01:03:29.718 --> 01:03:31.416
It's the right thing to do.

719
01:03:33.331 --> 01:03:35.202
You can wait with me
if you want.

720
01:03:35.246 --> 01:03:36.813
No. Mm-mm.

721
01:03:38.553 --> 01:03:40.555
Suit yourself.

722
01:03:40.599 --> 01:03:42.166
I ain't sittin' around here
like no duck,

723
01:03:42.209 --> 01:03:44.864
waitin' for his men
to come pick us off.

724
01:03:44.908 --> 01:03:46.257
Now, look,
I said I would try to help,

725
01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:47.998
but I ain't riskin' my life.

726
01:03:48.041 --> 01:03:49.651
You change your mind,

727
01:03:49.695 --> 01:03:51.523
my farm is four miles away
from here.

728
01:03:56.136 --> 01:03:58.443
I'd appreciate
you givin' my gun back.

729
01:03:58.486 --> 01:04:00.880
Don't you dare.

730
01:04:00.924 --> 01:04:03.187
Don't you dare give him
that gun back now.

731
01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:04.449
God damn it.

732
01:04:06.930 --> 01:04:08.192
Don't you do it.

733
01:04:11.064 --> 01:04:12.152
Oh, fuck.

734
01:04:18.289 --> 01:04:19.507
Well...

735
01:04:21.031 --> 01:04:22.510
good luck, gal.

736
01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:25.818
You gonna need it.

737
01:04:28.690 --> 01:04:30.867
Yeah, you go on now.

738
01:04:30.910 --> 01:04:32.259
Go on.

739
01:04:33.347 --> 01:04:36.133
Fuckin' huntin'
and fuckin' farmin'.

740
01:04:36.176 --> 01:04:38.222
Go on.

741
01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:42.748
Wait.

742
01:04:50.408 --> 01:04:53.890
I ain't never met you
before in my life,

743
01:04:53.933 --> 01:04:55.979
but your story's addin' up.

744
01:04:57.850 --> 01:04:59.765
You mean everything you said?

745
01:05:02.986 --> 01:05:05.553
Got the same scars,
you and me.

746
01:05:06.424 --> 01:05:08.295
You got your forty acre?

747
01:05:08.339 --> 01:05:10.167
A mule?

748
01:05:10.776 --> 01:05:12.343
You feel free?

749
01:05:13.735 --> 01:05:15.824
I sure as hell don't.

750
01:05:19.350 --> 01:05:22.005
If I leave him with you,

751
01:05:22.048 --> 01:05:24.007
you let me take
one of your horses.

752
01:05:24.050 --> 01:05:25.269
Hey, hey.

753
01:05:25.312 --> 01:05:26.531
Hey, wait.

754
01:05:28.707 --> 01:05:30.013
You gonna leave me?

755
01:05:32.015 --> 01:05:34.495
You gonna let me go out
at the hands of him?

756
01:05:34.539 --> 01:05:36.628
You're the reason
why we're right here.

757
01:05:38.282 --> 01:05:39.587
Now you talkin'.

758
01:05:39.631 --> 01:05:41.850
Sound like a good idea to me.

759
01:05:41.894 --> 01:05:43.417
In fact, I'll unchain him.

760
01:05:43.461 --> 01:05:44.636
No. No.

761
01:05:44.679 --> 01:05:46.246
I don't think so.

762
01:05:46.290 --> 01:05:47.552
I'll do it.

763
01:05:48.683 --> 01:05:49.728
I'll do it.

764
01:05:49.771 --> 01:05:50.903
Yeah, suit yourself.

765
01:05:52.035 --> 01:05:53.297
What're you waitin' on?

766
01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:55.081
Go over here
and have me a drink.

767
01:05:55.125 --> 01:05:56.909
I can use one
after this damn night.

768
01:05:56.953 --> 01:05:58.302
Hey, listen to me.

769
01:06:00.043 --> 01:06:01.218
Take the gun.

770
01:06:01.261 --> 01:06:03.437
Hey. Look at me, look at me.

771
01:06:04.656 --> 01:06:07.050
You listen to me now.
You listen to me now.

772
01:06:07.093 --> 01:06:09.182
Stop, stop. Listen.
Listen to me.

773
01:06:09.226 --> 01:06:10.357
No.

774
01:06:10.401 --> 01:06:11.706
Listen to me.

775
01:06:13.056 --> 01:06:14.666
I know killers.

776
01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:20.150
He'll kill us both,
I swear to you.

777
01:06:28.723 --> 01:06:30.116
Mr. Field!

778
01:06:32.597 --> 01:06:34.381
Some damn good whiskey.

779
01:06:36.905 --> 01:06:38.864
Don't worry,
I'll save you some, darlin'.

780
01:06:40.474 --> 01:06:42.694
For the celebration.

781
01:06:50.919 --> 01:06:52.269
You kill those people?

782
01:06:52.312 --> 01:06:53.661
Those people,
they care nothin' about us.

783
01:06:53.705 --> 01:06:54.967
Go on, you shoot him. Go on.

784
01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:56.316
Put it down.

785
01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:57.796
I've been huntin' him
for five months,

786
01:06:57.839 --> 01:06:59.537
and I ain't
lettin' him get away.

787
01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:01.060
Come on, he's gonna kill you.
You shoot him!

788
01:07:01.104 --> 01:07:02.279
You ain't nothin'
but a murderer

789
01:07:02.322 --> 01:07:03.367
and a goddamn liar!

790
01:07:03.410 --> 01:07:05.151
So are you.

791
01:07:05.195 --> 01:07:08.415
Them people got
in my goddamn way!

792
01:07:08.459 --> 01:07:10.113
I don't know how long
I can hold off

793
01:07:10.156 --> 01:07:12.115
my desire
to blow your head off.

794
01:07:12.158 --> 01:07:13.551
Come on.

795
01:07:14.943 --> 01:07:18.556
Ain't nobody gettin' in
the way of what's owed to me.

796
01:07:18.599 --> 01:07:21.124
Least of all you.

797
01:07:21.167 --> 01:07:22.951
So, you just gonna
have to kill me.

798
01:07:22.995 --> 01:07:24.866
Come on, you pull it!

799
01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:32.004
Your bullets in the field.

800
01:07:35.355 --> 01:07:36.400
On your left!

801
01:07:36.443 --> 01:07:37.792
Shoot her!

802
01:07:43.972 --> 01:07:45.800
Come here.
Come here now.

803
01:07:45.844 --> 01:07:47.367
Come here.

804
01:07:48.281 --> 01:07:50.196
Should've listened to me, huh?

805
01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:52.242
- Come on! Come on!
- Should've come with me.

806
01:07:52.285 --> 01:07:53.895
Come on, get up.

807
01:07:53.939 --> 01:07:56.463
Shit. Hey!

808
01:08:02.252 --> 01:08:04.645
You a fuckin' killer?

809
01:08:19.443 --> 01:08:21.271
Cut him down!
Cut him, God damn it.

810
01:08:21.706 --> 01:08:22.881
Cut him!

811
01:08:29.844 --> 01:08:31.933
Come on now!

812
01:08:33.283 --> 01:08:34.675
Come on, get up!

813
01:08:34.719 --> 01:08:35.894
I'll kill you!

814
01:08:35.937 --> 01:08:36.938
Here!

815
01:08:38.679 --> 01:08:40.812
Oh, shit!

816
01:10:15.689 --> 01:10:17.561
You should've trusted me.

817
01:10:19.824 --> 01:10:21.739
Now, I know
why you did what you did,

818
01:10:21.782 --> 01:10:23.306
and I just wish
that you didn't.

819
01:10:29.137 --> 01:10:30.965
I wanted to trust him.

820
01:10:35.013 --> 01:10:36.928
He reminded me of my father.

821
01:10:39.191 --> 01:10:41.759
Everybody around you
ends up dead, don't they?

822
01:10:54.902 --> 01:10:56.252
This is your fault.

823
01:10:56.295 --> 01:10:59.342
No, no, no, no, no, no.

824
01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:01.735
No.

825
01:11:03.607 --> 01:11:05.478
Death follows you, don't it?

826
01:11:06.610 --> 01:11:08.960
It follows you.

827
01:11:09.003 --> 01:11:11.005
Whether you like it or not,
there it is.

828
01:11:14.008 --> 01:11:15.532
You think when you get
where you're going,

829
01:11:15.575 --> 01:11:17.273
it's just gonna disappear?

830
01:11:18.448 --> 01:11:20.667
You gonna trade in
that six shooter for a dress?

831
01:11:22.843 --> 01:11:24.323
No.

832
01:11:24.367 --> 01:11:27.370
That imposter will always
be knockin' at your door.

833
01:11:28.371 --> 01:11:30.373
It will find you
wherever you go.

834
01:11:32.853 --> 01:11:34.551
Now, you trust me now.

835
01:11:36.379 --> 01:11:37.945
I know.

836
01:11:51.655 --> 01:11:53.787
It won't be long now.

837
01:11:53.831 --> 01:11:56.050
My men are coming.

838
01:11:58.401 --> 01:12:00.185
It's in their best interest,
of course.

839
01:12:00.228 --> 01:12:02.666
I know things they wanna know.

840
01:12:02.709 --> 01:12:06.234
They're gonna shoot me
just as fast as shoot you

841
01:12:06.278 --> 01:12:08.759
if I don't give 'em
what they want.

842
01:12:09.890 --> 01:12:12.415
And I think you best
unchain me now.

843
01:12:20.597 --> 01:12:23.164
Follow you or die?

844
01:12:23.208 --> 01:12:25.384
I can't stop
what's about to happen.

845
01:12:31.085 --> 01:12:32.130
You're right.

846
01:12:32.173 --> 01:12:33.305
Yeah.

847
01:12:34.175 --> 01:12:36.003
Yeah.

848
01:12:36.047 --> 01:12:38.310
Being a soldier
is deep in my blood.

849
01:12:41.008 --> 01:12:43.837
I was the best damn soldier
in that battlefield.

850
01:12:45.361 --> 01:12:46.753
Better than any man.

851
01:12:49.495 --> 01:12:51.062
But I had to learn
as a Black woman

852
01:12:51.105 --> 01:12:53.238
livin' in this
damn white world...

853
01:12:55.545 --> 01:12:57.416
that I gotta work
three times as hard

854
01:12:57.460 --> 01:12:58.939
to get one-fifth
of what I deserve,

855
01:12:58.983 --> 01:13:01.028
and I'm tired of it.

856
01:13:05.337 --> 01:13:08.166
You gonna make me fight for
my life and prove that to you?

857
01:13:11.691 --> 01:13:12.953
Fine.

858
01:13:17.305 --> 01:13:20.613
Watch me set you
and your boys alight.

859
01:15:27.435 --> 01:15:29.046
Oh, no.

860
01:15:29.089 --> 01:15:31.178
Not Dakota. Oh...

861
01:15:32.049 --> 01:15:33.616
Oh, Dakota.

862
01:15:33.659 --> 01:15:36.749
Oh, boy.
I done you wrong, boy.

863
01:15:37.576 --> 01:15:39.317
I done you wrong.

864
01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:41.493
Tommy. Tommy!

865
01:15:43.364 --> 01:15:46.324
We thought they took you
to the Brushwood Gulch.

866
01:15:47.455 --> 01:15:48.935
Tommy.

867
01:15:48.979 --> 01:15:50.415
Tommy.

868
01:15:50.458 --> 01:15:51.590
- Tommy.
- Where is she?

869
01:15:51.634 --> 01:15:53.244
- She?
- Where is she?

870
01:15:53.287 --> 01:15:55.420
- She?
- She's gonna kill us.

871
01:15:55.463 --> 01:15:56.900
She?

872
01:15:57.988 --> 01:16:00.425
Well, she killed Rufus
and Halfbreed.

873
01:16:01.295 --> 01:16:02.383
And Dakota, too.

874
01:16:02.427 --> 01:16:03.820
What the hell
you doin' here, huh?

875
01:16:03.863 --> 01:16:05.125
Me go get that bitch!

876
01:16:05.169 --> 01:16:06.387
No! No, Pike.

877
01:16:06.431 --> 01:16:08.259
Pike. Hold on, Pike.

878
01:16:08.302 --> 01:16:11.741
Pike, look what she done.

879
01:16:25.668 --> 01:16:27.147
- Nah, you face her!
- Hey! Get up.

880
01:16:27.191 --> 01:16:28.366
You go and face her right now!

881
01:16:28.409 --> 01:16:30.194
I swear to God,
she gonna kill you!

882
01:16:30.237 --> 01:16:31.325
Go on!

883
01:16:32.762 --> 01:16:33.763
She...

884
01:16:35.155 --> 01:16:36.635
She went that way.

885
01:16:36.679 --> 01:16:39.333
Both of you guys,
you get after her right now!

886
01:16:39.377 --> 01:16:40.770
You want your money?

887
01:16:40.813 --> 01:16:42.598
You bring her back to me!

888
01:16:42.641 --> 01:16:44.208
I've had it with you!

889
01:16:44.251 --> 01:16:46.950
You don't know
the fuck you're dealing with!

890
01:16:46.993 --> 01:16:48.255
I know!

891
01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:51.955
I've been here!

892
01:16:51.998 --> 01:16:54.087
Come on, you get these chains
off me now. Come on.

893
01:16:55.654 --> 01:16:57.134
Hurry up now.

894
01:16:58.091 --> 01:16:59.658
Come on...

895
01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:06.404
Thomas, let's get the loot

896
01:17:06.447 --> 01:17:07.710
and get outta here.

897
01:17:07.753 --> 01:17:09.059
The hell are you doin'?

898
01:17:09.102 --> 01:17:10.147
I quit.

899
01:17:10.190 --> 01:17:11.322
The hell are you doin'?

900
01:17:11.365 --> 01:17:13.977
I waited six months already.

901
01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:16.544
That girl don't matter.

902
01:17:16.588 --> 01:17:21.593
Just give me what's due,
and I'm gone.

903
01:17:22.812 --> 01:17:24.465
It's comin' to ya.

904
01:17:24.509 --> 01:17:25.466
Yeah?

905
01:17:26.685 --> 01:17:27.686
It's comin' to ya.

906
01:17:27.730 --> 01:17:29.906
Is that a promise this time?

907
01:17:29.949 --> 01:17:31.864
On my life.

908
01:17:31.908 --> 01:17:33.387
All right.

909
01:17:49.229 --> 01:17:50.404
Ah, shit.

910
01:17:50.448 --> 01:17:51.841
Come here, buddy.

911
01:17:51.884 --> 01:17:54.017
Here's your hat.

912
01:17:54.060 --> 01:17:56.193
Come here, Thomas.

913
01:17:56.236 --> 01:17:57.498
Thattaboy.

914
01:17:58.108 --> 01:17:59.500
Put that on you now.

915
01:17:59.544 --> 01:18:01.241
Let me see ya.

916
01:18:01.285 --> 01:18:02.765
You look all right.

917
01:18:04.636 --> 01:18:06.333
I'll get your gun.

918
01:18:12.035 --> 01:18:13.427
That's a nice gun, Thomas.

919
01:18:13.471 --> 01:18:14.559
Yeah.

920
01:18:14.602 --> 01:18:16.082
-You'll have to clean it.
-Well...

921
01:18:18.911 --> 01:18:20.696
You didn't remember
to bring the shovels.

922
01:18:33.709 --> 01:18:35.406
You out there, little lady?

923
01:19:13.705 --> 01:19:15.489
She's sneaky.

924
01:19:45.432 --> 01:19:46.999
Hey.

925
01:19:47.043 --> 01:19:49.088
You go on,
and I'm gonna circle around.

926
01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:15.636
We know you're here!

927
01:21:20.963 --> 01:21:22.486
Tuco!

928
01:21:25.924 --> 01:21:27.360
Tuco!

929
01:21:32.104 --> 01:21:33.671
Where you at?

930
01:21:40.069 --> 01:21:42.027
Where you at, soldier girl?

931
01:22:13.232 --> 01:22:14.364
Get up.

932
01:22:17.149 --> 01:22:18.150
Oh, look at you.

933
01:22:18.585 --> 01:22:19.586
Come here.

934
01:22:20.413 --> 01:22:22.198
Get up here!

935
01:22:28.508 --> 01:22:31.468
Oh, what are you
gonna do with that, huh?

936
01:23:55.639 --> 01:23:57.032
You know,

937
01:23:59.164 --> 01:24:00.513
I really thought

938
01:24:02.037 --> 01:24:04.691
that you'd have sympathized
with a man in chains.

939
01:24:06.258 --> 01:24:09.305
Brutalized by the world same
way that it brutalized you,

940
01:24:12.786 --> 01:24:14.571
but I must have misjudged you.

941
01:24:18.966 --> 01:24:21.491
You set your boys on me
to take my life.

942
01:24:21.534 --> 01:24:23.536
Well, you know what?
You killed all of 'em.

943
01:24:24.363 --> 01:24:26.104
Just you and me now.

944
01:24:26.148 --> 01:24:28.846
I'mma fight for my life
by any means necessary.

945
01:24:32.415 --> 01:24:34.156
We ain't got no future apart.

946
01:24:36.201 --> 01:24:37.594
We don't.

947
01:24:37.637 --> 01:24:39.857
You got nothin'.

948
01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:41.902
All I got is the gallows,
that's it.

949
01:24:43.904 --> 01:24:45.863
Now, you listen to me now.

950
01:24:47.169 --> 01:24:49.519
Together, I think
we could be something.

951
01:24:49.562 --> 01:24:51.695
I mean, we could be
something that's important,

952
01:24:51.738 --> 01:24:53.218
that means something.

953
01:24:54.306 --> 01:24:56.178
We could be more than this!

954
01:24:56.221 --> 01:24:58.049
More than this!

955
01:24:59.311 --> 01:25:00.530
You and me.

956
01:25:00.573 --> 01:25:02.227
Tommy Walsh!

957
01:25:02.271 --> 01:25:05.230
Tommy Walsh
and the Colored Girl.

958
01:25:06.101 --> 01:25:07.319
God damn!

959
01:25:07.363 --> 01:25:09.321
That's not a headline
you heard before.

960
01:25:10.148 --> 01:25:11.106
It ain't.

961
01:25:14.674 --> 01:25:17.895
What do you think your people
will think about that, huh?

962
01:25:20.593 --> 01:25:22.334
And you'd be a hero!

963
01:25:24.771 --> 01:25:27.296
You'd be a legend
in your time!

964
01:25:28.775 --> 01:25:31.126
You'd be an inspiration
to them.

965
01:25:32.257 --> 01:25:34.825
The infamy, the glory of it!

966
01:25:35.565 --> 01:25:36.740
Can you imagine?

967
01:25:39.786 --> 01:25:42.049
I didn't get a piece
of my promised land.

968
01:25:45.705 --> 01:25:48.055
Didn't get the rivers flowin'
with milk and honey.

969
01:25:51.146 --> 01:25:52.843
And I'd never take your deal.

970
01:25:53.583 --> 01:25:54.975
Ah, fuck you!

971
01:25:55.498 --> 01:25:56.716
Come on!

972
01:25:58.762 --> 01:26:00.807
I've given you
everything that I got.

973
01:26:01.939 --> 01:26:03.897
You have
the opportunity now...

974
01:26:05.682 --> 01:26:08.554
to take what you deserve,
what we both deserve!

975
01:26:11.427 --> 01:26:13.298
You gonna have
to kill me right here.

976
01:26:23.787 --> 01:26:25.876
I'll tell you what,
it ain't gonna be easy.

977
01:26:28.618 --> 01:26:29.619
No.

978
01:26:31.751 --> 01:26:33.884
Not after everything
that we've been through.

979
01:26:36.234 --> 01:26:37.192
All right.

980
01:26:38.367 --> 01:26:39.629
You holster it now.

981
01:26:42.893 --> 01:26:45.765
We gonna do this,
we're gonna holster it.

982
01:26:49.421 --> 01:26:50.422
Come on.

983
01:26:57.473 --> 01:26:58.474
There it is.

984
01:27:06.743 --> 01:27:08.353
You never asked me my name.

985
01:27:09.572 --> 01:27:10.747
You're right.

986
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:13.837
I don't
even know your name.

987
01:27:20.235 --> 01:27:21.279
Fuck.

988
01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:43.214
Wanna know my name?

989
01:27:46.304 --> 01:27:48.219
It's Mo Washington.

990
01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:51.266
That's my name.

991
01:27:57.489 --> 01:27:58.577
Washington.

992
01:28:00.362 --> 01:28:01.537
Mo Washington.

993
01:28:05.105 --> 01:28:06.846
I'm glad it's
at the hands of you.

994
01:28:08.892 --> 01:28:10.285
Let me tell you somethin'.

995
01:28:13.288 --> 01:28:14.593
Let me tell you somethin'.

996
01:28:15.986 --> 01:28:18.554
You... You know
where the money is.

997
01:28:20.512 --> 01:28:23.210
Your faith is your freedom.

998
01:28:55.547 --> 01:29:00.030
Glory, glory, hallelujah!

999
01:29:02.467 --> 01:29:04.861
 Glory, glory...

1000
01:29:40.157 --> 01:29:41.506
Bag of nails.

1001
01:29:45.902 --> 01:29:47.251
Lord have mercy.

1002
01:29:48.339 --> 01:29:50.036
Too late.

1003
01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:51.734
This one's still alive.

1004
01:29:51.777 --> 01:29:53.083
We'll see about that.

1005
01:29:55.999 --> 01:29:58.088
What in bloody hell
happened here, son?

1006
01:30:03.615 --> 01:30:05.400
Tommy's boys, they...

1007
01:30:06.705 --> 01:30:08.707
they beat me real bad.

1008
01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:12.319
I got knocked out,
and when I woke up,

1009
01:30:12.363 --> 01:30:14.191
all these dead bodies
were here, sir.

1010
01:30:16.672 --> 01:30:18.413
Killed each other?

1011
01:30:18.456 --> 01:30:20.197
Killed each other?
It's a massacre.

1012
01:30:20.719 --> 01:30:22.068
Who are all them?

1013
01:30:23.461 --> 01:30:27.552
That's, uh, Goldie Whitman
and Dakota Smitt,

1014
01:30:27.596 --> 01:30:29.424
Tommy's guys.

1015
01:30:29.467 --> 01:30:32.252
There's Tommy
and the coach driver.

1016
01:30:32.296 --> 01:30:34.385
But I don't know
who these others are.

1017
01:30:34.429 --> 01:30:37.649
Can't be nobody good
if they out here.

1018
01:30:37.693 --> 01:30:40.870
Tommy say anything about
the money, where he hid it?

1019
01:30:43.916 --> 01:30:45.788
No, sir,
he barely talked at all.

1020
01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:50.749
You're lucky
they didn't kill ya.

1021
01:30:52.490 --> 01:30:53.796
What ain't you telling us?

1022
01:30:56.538 --> 01:30:59.018
Well, seems very simple to me.

1023
01:31:01.238 --> 01:31:04.546
You got a bunch
of bad guys over here,

1024
01:31:04.589 --> 01:31:08.027
a bunch of bad guys
over there.

1025
01:31:08.071 --> 01:31:11.988
They turned on one another,
and then killed each other.

1026
01:31:15.992 --> 01:31:17.472
What do you say, Sheriff?

1027
01:31:18.473 --> 01:31:19.735
They're dead.

1028
01:31:19.778 --> 01:31:22.651
Rewards need payin',
and lives need livin'.

1029
01:31:22.694 --> 01:31:24.304
What are you gonna do?

1030
01:31:24.348 --> 01:31:26.785
Hang this one
just for bein' here?

1031
01:31:27.743 --> 01:31:30.833
I'm sure he don't know
what happened.

1032
01:31:30.876 --> 01:31:33.749
So, we ain't ever
gonna know what happened.

1033
01:31:35.011 --> 01:31:37.013
They all got
what they deserve.

1034
01:31:38.667 --> 01:31:41.931
You think this fella here

1035
01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:45.064
killed all these men?

1036
01:31:46.196 --> 01:31:48.328
No man I know
could do all that.

1037
01:31:54.334 --> 01:31:57.990
There's a $10,000 bounty
on Tommy Walsh's head.

1038
01:31:59.383 --> 01:32:02.125
You got that comin' to you,
Mr. Wheeler.

1039
01:32:02.168 --> 01:32:04.606
Do I need to bring
these men back into town?

1040
01:32:06.433 --> 01:32:07.565
I seen 'em.

1041
01:32:09.611 --> 01:32:11.134
I suppose, uh,

1042
01:32:13.092 --> 01:32:14.311
some would hang ya.

1043
01:32:14.354 --> 01:32:16.052
You suppose right, Sheriff.

1044
01:32:17.140 --> 01:32:19.185
But I guess it just seems...

1045
01:32:21.057 --> 01:32:22.145
Well...

1046
01:32:23.668 --> 01:32:28.194
it seems if there is a God
that he wanted you alive.

1047
01:32:28.934 --> 01:32:30.936
So, just in case,

1048
01:32:31.937 --> 01:32:33.678
I ain't gonna interfere.

1049
01:32:36.028 --> 01:32:38.030
But you're gonna
clean up this mess.

1050
01:32:38.074 --> 01:32:39.423
Go get a shovel.

1051
01:32:40.424 --> 01:32:41.643
You're gonna bury
all these bodies,

1052
01:32:41.686 --> 01:32:43.122
and then be on about your way.

1053
01:32:44.776 --> 01:32:46.561
And be thankful for it.

1054
01:32:50.652 --> 01:32:51.609
Yes, sir.

1055
01:32:53.655 --> 01:32:55.178
That's it?

1056
01:32:55.221 --> 01:32:56.309
Somewhere around here,

1057
01:32:56.353 --> 01:32:57.702
he buried
all that stolen loot.

1058
01:32:57.746 --> 01:32:59.399
We just gonna leave it?

1059
01:32:59.443 --> 01:33:00.662
What are you gonna do?

1060
01:33:00.705 --> 01:33:02.185
Dig up the whole county?

1061
01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:04.883
You be my guest.

1062
01:33:04.927 --> 01:33:08.539
But the rest of you, head back
to the saloon, I'm buying.

1063
01:33:10.541 --> 01:33:12.543
What about the bank loot,
Sheriff?

1064
01:33:13.457 --> 01:33:16.286
Sorry, boys, you heard him.

1065
01:33:17.504 --> 01:33:19.028
Say goodbye to the money.

1066
01:33:26.165 --> 01:33:27.340
Good luck, fella.

1067
01:34:47.769 --> 01:34:49.727
"The meek shall inherit
the earth."
