00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.460
<i>I'm Stephen Rebello,</i>

2
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.010
<i>and I am the author of</i>
Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho,

3
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.680
<i>and it's my pleasure to be your companion
on this special DVD edition</i>

4
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.930
<i>of Alfred Hitchcock's 47th film,</i> Psycho.

5
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.030
Psycho <i>was unleashed on audiences
in June of 1960,</i>

6
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.950
<i>and it's really no exaggeration to say
that movies haven't been the same since.</i>

7
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.540
<i>Nearly 50 years later,
we're still talking about,</i>

8
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.000
<i>arguing about, writing about
and dissecting</i> Psycho,

9
00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.420
<i>still uncovering layers of meaning,
symbolism and complexity.</i>

10
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.050
<i>Most importantly though,
we're still enjoying it as a beautifully made,</i>

11
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.140
<i>scary, groundbreaking
and hugely entertaining film.</i>

12
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.230
<i>Hitchcock's most famous
and financially successful picture,</i>

13
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:04.940
<i>a true cultural phenomenon,</i>

14
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.310
Psycho <i>has been called
the first modern horror thriller.</i>

15
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.150
<i>It has evoked comparisons
to works by Shakespeare,</i>

16
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.150
<i>Poe, Dostoyevsky, the BrontÃ«s.</i>

17
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.990
<i>Robert Louis Stevenson,
the symphonies of Stravinsky</i>

18
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.910
<i>and that's merely the tip of the iceberg.</i>

19
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.040
<i>As we go along, we're going to see</i>

20
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.870
<i>how this movie defied
almost all of the norms of the late 1950s</i>

21
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.750
<i>and how it arrived way ahead of the curve.</i>

22
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.090
<i>It announced a new era of frankness,
sexuality and explosive violence</i>

23
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.340
<i>both on and off the screen.</i>

24
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.930
<i>Let's take a look at this title sequence,
just for example.</i>

25
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.180
<i>It was the work of the innovative
graphic designer, Saul Bass.</i>

26
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.730
<i>And he created film title sequences
really that were unique</i>

27
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.770
<i>in having thematic
and emotional connections</i>

28
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.940
<i>to the films they preceded.</i>

29
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.450
<i>Here, his frenetic, driving,
parallel line imagery</i>

30
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.290
<i>is really a perfect compliment
to the all-strings musical score</i>

31
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.250
<i>by genius film composer Bernard Herrmann.</i>

32
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.970
<i>In an article in a industry newspaper,</i>
Variety, <i>on December 27th, 1959,</i>

33
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.300
<i>Hitchcock boasted that</i> Psycho <i>would open</i>

34
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.510
<i>with the longest dolly shot
ever attempted by helicopter,</i>

35
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.640
<i>a 4-mile scene that would rival or even top</i>

36
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.400
<i>Orson Welles' remarkable opening sequence
for</i> Touch of Evil, <i>released in 1958.</i>

37
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.480
<i>But complicated helicopter shots
were pretty new back then</i>

38
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.650
<i>and Tyler Mounts hadn't even been invented,</i>

39
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.870
<i>so Hitchcock didn't get the opening
he wanted, but I love this opening.</i>

40
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.540
<i>It's gritty, it's sad, it's furtive and it sets up
a recurring visual pattern of the film</i>

41
00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.500
<i>that is a horizontal plane
juxtaposed with a vertical.</i>

42
00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:54.920
<i>He was a man who loved to set</i>

43
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.260
<i>major technical challenges
for himself and his crew.</i>

44
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.010
<i>And his theme in</i> Psycho,
<i>or one of them, was voyeurism,</i>

45
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.270
<i>and he got very intrigued by the notion
of the camera replicating the flight of a fly</i>

46
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.110
<i>that would zoom straight into a hotel room
and kind of be a fly on the wall, as it were.</i>

47
00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.780
<i>And clearly
we're in a completely different universe</i>

48
00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.860
<i>from the swank Monte Carlo hotels
in Hitchcock's</i> To Catch a Thief

49
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.990
<i>or the Ambassador East
of</i> North by Northwest.

50
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.290
<i>I've always loved the sense in this scene,</i>

51
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.500
<i>that, almost as if in</i> Rear Window,

52
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.130
<i>we might have peeked
into any of these random rooms</i>

53
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.750
<i>and found a compelling human story.</i>

54
00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.970
<i>It's like there are 8 million stories
in the naked city,</i>

55
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.130
<i>as the narrator used to say
in the old TV show,</i>

56
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.760
<i>and we're going to see one of them.</i>

57
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.180
<i>Hitchcock was well-known
for his predilection for provocative,</i>

58
00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:51.730
<i>sexy love scenes.</i>

59
00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.270
<i>And with the dawn of the 1960s,
he believed that audiences</i>

60
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.900
<i>wanted their love scenes to be,
I don't know, more frank</i>

61
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.820
<i>and closer to the way people live their lives.</i>

62
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.660
<i>You see, unlike the characters
of most of Hitchcock's American thrillers,</i>

63
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.410
<i>the characters in</i> Psycho
<i>are work-a-day, average people.</i>

64
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.000
<i>They're pretty, but certainly they're a little
careworn and frayed around the edges.</i>

65
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.420
<i>So, here John Gavin is shirtless,
Janet Leigh is in a white bra and slip.</i>

66
00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.180
<i>They're not married, they're horizontal,</i>

67
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.510
<i>the language is bolder,
and they've just made love in a cheap hotel</i>

68
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.850
<i>on a hot afternoon
during a long lunch break.</i>

69
00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.850
<i>Very, very pushy stuff
for mainstream American movies in 1960.</i>

70
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.690
<font color="#dcdcdc">...in public?</font>

71
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.610
<font color="#dcdcdc">Oh, we can see each other.
We can even have dinner.</font>

72
00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.150
<font color="#dcdcdc">But respectably.</font>

73
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.160
<i>The leading man here is John Gavin,
a very popular rising star</i>

74
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.700
<i>under contract to Universal</i>

75
00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.830
<i>and being groomed as a successor
to Rock Hudson.</i>

76
00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.580
<i>He was fairly new and inexperienced
and very shy about his physical attributes,</i>

77
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.920
<i>which made him very uncomfortable
doing this scene.</i>

78
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.800
<font color="#dcdcdc">Marion, whenever it's possible,
I want to see you.</font>

79
00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.100
<font color="#dcdcdc">And under any circumstances,
even respectability.</font>

80
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.390
<font color="#dcdcdc">You make respectability
sound disrespectful.</font>

81
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.150
<i>Incidentally, this sequence lays down</i>

82
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.230
<i>the recurring theme of secretiveness
and furtiveness,</i>

83
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.070
<i>and it proved to be something of an audition
for screenwriter, Joseph Stefano.</i>

84
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.030
<i>Stefano was the second screenwriter
involved on</i> Psycho.

85
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.830
<i>The first was James Cavanagh,
an Emmy winner</i>

86
00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.540
<i>who had done several episodes
of</i> Alfred Hitchcock Presents,

87
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.670
<i>the weekly TV show that had been
on the air since 1955.</i>

88
00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:48.180
<i>Cavanagh's screenplay didn't exactly
pass muster, so Joseph Stefano was hired,</i>

89
00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.600
<i>but he was hired provisionally.</i>

90
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:52.850
<i>Stefano was a former musician.</i>

91
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:58.060
<i>He'd won attention for</i> The Black Orchid,
<i>a mafia film, love story, really,</i>

92
00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.570
<i>starring Sophia Loren,
that was done by Paramount.</i>

93
00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.320
<i>He was a young, brash,
very talented newcomer</i>

94
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.700
<i>with a very strong, sharp,
twisted sense of humour.</i>

95
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.660
<i>Hitchcock really didn't like
working with new people,</i>

96
00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.660
<i>especially new, young people.</i>

97
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.330
<i>So, he kind of hedged his bets
about Stefano</i>

98
00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:19.620
<i>until the writer turned in the sequence
we're now seeing.</i>

99
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.840
<i>The biggest compliment you could ever get
from Hitchcock was that...</i>

100
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:31.470
<i>His wife, who had been a film editor and
his trusted behind-the-scenes collaborator,</i>

101
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:36.270
<i>would look at a scene or look at a script
or look at an actor,</i>

102
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.940
<i>and if she really liked something,</i>

103
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.560
<i>Hitchcock would later tell that person,
"Alma loved it."</i>

104
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.730
<i>Well, Alma loved this scene,
and Stefano was hired.</i>

105
00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.700
<font color="#dcdcdc">- Don't miss your plane.
- Hey, we can leave together, can't we?</font>

106
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.740
<font color="#dcdcdc">I'm late and you have to put your shoes on.</font>

107
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:04.630
<i>Here we have Janet Leigh in all white
in her good-girl mode</i>

108
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.420
<i>passing a very familiar figure
loitering outside.</i>

109
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.010
<i>That's Alfred Hitchcock, of course.</i>

110
00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:11.260
<i>And here's another Hitchcock,</i>

111
00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.930
<i>his and Alma's only child,
Patricia Hitchcock,</i>

112
00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:16.260
<i>who had acted on Broadway, on television</i>

113
00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:20.520
<i>and in her father's films</i>
Strangers on a Train <i>and</i> Stage Fright.

114
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.270
<i>Note that the dialogue given
to the chatty character</i>

115
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:27.360
<i>played by Patricia restates certain themes,
lies and deception.</i>

116
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.650
<i>Her mother gave her tranquilisers
on the day of her wedding</i>

117
00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:35.450
<i>and she had not told her new husband,
a very wry commentary on wedded bliss.</i>

118
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:38.660
<font color="#dcdcdc">Oh, your sister called to say
she's going to Tucson to do some buying</font>

119
00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.710
<font color="#dcdcdc">and she'll be gone the whole weekend and...</font>

120
00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:44.790
<i>Also note the casual menace</i>

121
00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.630
<i>in which the character mentions
how her husband had called</i>

122
00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:50.260
<i>and her mother had called
to see if he had called.</i>

123
00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:51.930
<i>Marion has no husband.</i>

124
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:55.640
<i>Only a sister telling her
that she'll be away all weekend.</i>

125
00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:58.180
<i>It's a terrific scene.</i>

126
00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.100
<i>We're introduced
to Marion's ineffectual boss.</i>

127
00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:06.230
<i>We also meet Cassidy, the oil millionaire,
a letch who tries to put the make on her.</i>

128
00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.940
<i>Note his boasting
about buying off unhappiness</i>

129
00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:12.650
<i>and the vulgar way
he throws around $40,000 cash</i>

130
00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:16.030
<i>to buy his 18-year-old daughter
a house as a wedding present.</i>

131
00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:20.370
<i>In a previous scene, of course,
Marion and Sam, who are a lot older than 18,</i>

132
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:22.160
<i>can't marry because of finances.</i>

133
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.790
<font color="#dcdcdc">...and she never had an unhappy day
in any one of those years.</font>

134
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.840
<font color="#dcdcdc">Come on, Tom. My office is air conditioned.</font>

135
00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.760
<font color="#dcdcdc">Do you know what I do about unhappiness?</font>

136
00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.220
<font color="#dcdcdc">I buy it off.</font>

137
00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.680
<font color="#dcdcdc">Are... Are you unhappy?</font>

138
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:41.060
<font color="#dcdcdc">Not inordinately.</font>

139
00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:46.270
<font color="#dcdcdc">I'm buying this house
for my baby's wedding present.</font>

140
00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.770
<font color="#dcdcdc">$40,000 cash.</font>

141
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:56.870
<font color="#dcdcdc">Now that's not buying happiness.
That's just buying off unhappiness.</font>

142
00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:02.120
<i>It's remarkable to consider how starkly
different</i> Psycho <i>looks and sounds</i>

143
00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.040
<i>compared to Hitchcock's
just two previous films,</i>

144
00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.380
North by Northwest <i>and</i> Vertigo.

145
00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:10.500
<i>Those were both
lush Technicolor big movies</i>

146
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:15.970
<i>that kind of epitomised the director as
a maker of huge, glamorous entertainments.</i>

147
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:19.720
<i>But Hitchcock, in his late-50s
when he made</i> Psycho,

148
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.390
<i>was out to do something entirely different.</i>

149
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:26.560
<i>A film of modest budget, roughly $800, 000,</i>

150
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.980
<i>which is, by the way, about
one-fifth of the cost of</i> North by Northwest.

151
00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.570
Psycho <i>was done
on a completely tight shooting schedule,</i>

152
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:39.660
<i>one that allowed for bold experimentation,
pushiness and even subversiveness.</i>

153
00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:46.040
Psycho <i>was in part influenced
by the 1955 international smash hit film</i>

154
00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.750
Les diaboliques,
<i>directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot.</i>

155
00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:52.090
<i>That was also in black and white.</i>

156
00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:55.550
<i>It featured grimy, everyday settings
and characters,</i>

157
00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:58.930
<i>and featured a knock-out scare sequence
in a very white bathroom,</i>

158
00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:01.050
<i>as well as a twist ending.</i>

159
00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:06.600
<i>Hitchcock loved that film.
He envied its ruthlessness, its economy</i>

160
00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.650
<i>and the screams it ripped
from the throats of moviegoers.</i>

161
00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:13.190
Diaboliques <i>was frank and adult,
and so would</i> Psycho <i>be.</i>

162
00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:16.860
<i>Hitchcock was out to make a film
that not only amused him</i>

163
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:20.700
<i>but was absolutely unlike anything
anyone had seen before.</i>

164
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.830
<i>It was a film that would also reinvent
Hitchcock for a brand new generation.</i>

165
00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:30.460
<i>Hitchcock had been taking a look around
and he saw that low-budget horror movies</i>

166
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:32.670
<i>were really making a fortune
at the box office.</i>

167
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:36.970
<i>And he wondered, what if somebody
really talented made one of those?</i>

168
00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:39.880
<i>And he found
in the</i> New York Times <i>review of books,</i>

169
00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:44.470
<i>a very strong review for a novel
by Robert Bloch called</i> Psycho.

170
00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:48.560
<i>He bought the screen rights anonymously
for about $9,000,</i>

171
00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:52.810
<i>and he stunned his long-time colleagues
by announcing</i>

172
00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.980
<i>that he wanted to make a small,
modestly-scaled horror movie</i>

173
00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:58.820
<i>that would just scare the pants off people.</i>

174
00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:03.740
<i>One of his most brilliant moves was
to hire Janet Leigh to play Marion Crane.</i>

175
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:09.500
<i>At the time, she was a hugely popular,
lovely and physically stunning movie star,</i>

176
00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:12.290
<i>most often associated, though,
with light comedies,</i>

177
00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.380
<i>musicals and period epics.</i>

178
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:18.170
<i>In those days, she rarely got a chance
to do dramatic roles</i>

179
00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.380
<i>aside from things like</i> Touch of Evil
<i>for Orson Welles.</i>

180
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:28.350
<i>Meanwhile, a very significant change
in costume.</i>

181
00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:31.770
<i>Now, she's wearing a black half slip
and a bra.</i>

182
00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:35.730
<i>This was a deliberate choice
on Hitchcock's part</i>

183
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:39.440
<i>to show the duality in the character's nature.</i>

184
00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:49.870
<i>Note how Hitchcock keeps the camera close
and intimate on Janet Leigh.</i>

185
00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:52.170
<i>It's drawing in the audience.</i>

186
00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:56.710
<i>Marion, with a very significant wall mirror
placed behind her,</i>

187
00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:59.210
<i>reveals the duality of her personality</i>

188
00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:03.640
<i>as she has made a decision
to impulsively steal $40,000.</i>

189
00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:06.140
<i>Hitchcock was a brilliant technician</i>

190
00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.680
<i>who knew camera lenses
as well as any cinematographer.</i>

191
00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.690
<i>Because he wanted the camera
to be the eyes of the audience</i>

192
00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:14.230
<i>and wanted the audience to feel</i>

193
00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:16.980
<i>that they were seeing the events
with their own eyes,</i>

194
00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:22.490
<i>he insisted that his cameraman film
the entire movie using 50 mm lenses.</i>

195
00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:27.910
<i>50 mm lenses give the closest approximation
to human vision available at that time.</i>

196
00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:30.870
<i>Again, the theme is voyeurism.</i>

197
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.210
<i>Note also how often he cuts back
to the money in the envelope.</i>

198
00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:38.630
<i>Should she take it?
Should she stop before it's too late?</i>

199
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:43.470
<i>Through performance, camera placement
and tense, anxiety-ridden music,</i>

200
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:46.510
<i>we're not only brought
into the character's thought processes</i>

201
00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:49.180
<i>but into her mind state and emotions.</i>

202
00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.150
<i>The driving scenes were accomplished
on the sound stage</i>

203
00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:07.910
<i>using a cutout car and rear projection,</i>

204
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:12.410
<i>with Hitchcock himself just off camera
voicing the character's inner fears</i>

205
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:16.790
<i>and helping guide Janet Leigh's strong
and persuasive performance.</i>

206
00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.210
<i>By the way,
notice the Christmas decorations</i>

207
00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:21.250
<i>strung over the streets of Phoenix.</i>

208
00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:25.220
<i>That was a glitch that occurred
during second unit filming in Arizona.</i>

209
00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.220
<i>It was Christmas time,
but Hitchcock hadn't planned</i>

210
00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:31.060
<i>on the movie being set during the holiday,</i>

211
00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:34.810
<i>so, because those decorations
happened to be there,</i>

212
00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.860
<i>that's why in the opening of the film
there are titles</i>

213
00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:44.530
<i>that list the date as December the 11th.
Friday, December the 11th to be exact.</i>

214
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:56.500
<i>Hitchcock called this his 30-day picture.</i>

215
00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.120
<i>Principal photography took place</i>

216
00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:02.960
<i>from November 11th, 1959,
through February 1st, 1960.</i>

217
00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:08.260
<i>To keep the cost down, Hitchcock
used his reliable and trusted members</i>

218
00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:12.350
<i>of his TV show crew,
including cinematographer John L. Russell</i>

219
00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:15.180
<i>and assistant director Hilton A. Green.</i>

220
00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:18.980
<i>But the film cost so little to make
and was filmed so quickly and efficiently</i>

221
00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:23.070
<i>because Hitchcock and his associates
had lavished all the prep time</i>

222
00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:27.740
<i>and all the pre-planning as they would
for any other major Hitchcock feature.</i>

223
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:32.030
<i>The preparation included storyboarding
every scene and camera angle.</i>

224
00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.660
<i>For this scene,
Janet Leigh's section of the film,</i>

225
00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:38.210
<i>the director sent his colleagues
to research and photograph the details</i>

226
00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:39.710
<i>of the life and living situation</i>

227
00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:43.170
<i>of a typical 30-year-old secretary
living in Phoenix.</i>

228
00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:49.470
<i>Hitchcock had a very well-known fear
of policemen,</i>

229
00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:52.430
<i>and that comes across very strongly
in this sequence.</i>

230
00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:55.430
<i>He owned a driver's licence
but drove quite badly,</i>

231
00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.600
<i>and his wife often did the driving.</i>

232
00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:00.310
<i>The actor Mort Mills
plays the highway patrolman here.</i>

233
00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:04.440
<i>And in keeping the film's motif
very, very squarely,</i>

234
00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:06.940
<i>it's about reflective surfaces and mirrors,</i>

235
00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:11.740
<i>so he wears dark glasses
that make him menacing and inscrutable.</i>

236
00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:14.740
<i>He says very little, he implies a great deal,</i>

237
00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:19.210
<i>and he represents authority as merciless,
unyielding and almost inhuman.</i>

238
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.960
<i>One of the many dark jokes in the script
is the police saying to Marion</i>

239
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.000
<i>that she shouldn't have slept in her car.</i>

240
00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:31.470
<i>She should have gone to one of the many
local motels, quote, "Just to be safe."</i>

241
00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:35.930
<i>All of these shots in this sequence
are so beautifully composed.</i>

242
00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:40.940
<i>Mills, by the way, reunited with Hitchcock
six years later for a brief role as a spy</i>

243
00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:43.520
<i>posing as a farmer in</i> Torn Curtain.

244
00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:46.610
<font color="#dcdcdc">I've told you there's nothing wrong,</font>

245
00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:49.610
<font color="#dcdcdc">except that I'm in a hurry
and you're taking up my time.</font>

246
00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:52.860
<font color="#dcdcdc">Now, just a moment.
Turn your motor off, please.</font>

247
00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:57.370
<font color="#dcdcdc">May I see your licence?</font>

248
00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.290
<font color="#dcdcdc">- Why?
- Please.</font>

249
00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:06.630
<i>Hitchcock had wonderful relationships
with actors he respected and admired.</i>

250
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:09.050
<i>He wasn't one to give a lot of praise,</i>

251
00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:13.050
<i>but he would adjust a performance
only if he needed that adjustment</i>

252
00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:17.010
<i>or if the performance didn't square
with kind of his preordained way</i>

253
00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:19.470
<i>of telling the story and moving the camera.</i>

254
00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:23.100
<i>Janet Leigh utterly won him over
when he learned that prior to production,</i>

255
00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:27.440
<i>she had written an entire history
of Marion Crane pretty much from birth</i>

256
00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:30.360
<i>and filled with specific intimate details.</i>

257
00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:34.320
<i>I spent a lot of time with Janet Leigh
at one point,</i>

258
00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:38.200
<i>and she had a marvellous easy laugh
and blushed very easily.</i>

259
00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:43.040
<i>And that's something that Perkins
and Hitchcock had to have found irresistible.</i>

260
00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:44.580
<i>And they did.</i>

261
00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:53.170
<i>Watch how Hitchcock builds up the tension
and conveys Marion's guilt and nervousness</i>

262
00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:57.010
<i>and dual nature by having her look
in a rear-view mirror.</i>

263
00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:02.810
<i>Watch her hands during this sequence,
full of tension, full of menace.</i>

264
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:24.330
<i>It's interesting to note in</i> Psycho <i>that
all of the cars are Ford company motor cars,</i>

265
00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:26.750
<i>because Ford sponsored many of the shows</i>

266
00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:31.590
<i>filmed at Revue Studios at Universal,
including Hitchcock's TV show.</i>

267
00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:02.990
<i>Hitchcock filmed this particular sequence
at a car lot</i>

268
00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:06.160
<i>on Lankershim Boulevard
very close to Universal.</i>

269
00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:08.830
<i>Today it's a BMW dealership.</i>

270
00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.130
<i>The sequence is a great demonstration</i>

271
00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:13.420
<i>of Hitchcock's use
of subjective camera technique</i>

272
00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:18.930
<i>as a means of sort of intensifying
audience identification with a character.</i>

273
00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:21.430
<i>Hence the camera moves with Janet Leigh.</i>

274
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:24.350
<i>So, we, the audience members,
move with her.</i>

275
00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:27.310
<i>What she sees,
the licence plates from different states,</i>

276
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:31.190
<i>are what we see,
and that lets us into her thought processes.</i>

277
00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:35.820
<i>I've watched this film with audiences
and students many times over the years</i>

278
00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:39.570
<i>and they seem to become annoyed
with Janet Leigh's character at this point.</i>

279
00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:43.620
<i>They've often told me,
"She acts so suspiciously. She's stupid."</i>

280
00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:47.330
<i>Of course, audiences always feel
that they are smarter than the characters,</i>

281
00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:51.540
<i>but you have to remember that Marion
isn't a cool, practised thief.</i>

282
00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:55.380
<i>She's doing this out of passion.
She's doing this out of impulse.</i>

283
00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.840
<i>And she's almost doing it in a fugue state.</i>

284
00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:01.760
<i>She's confused, she's troubled
and she isn't thinking clearly.</i>

285
00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:16.820
<font color="#dcdcdc">- I'm in no mood for trouble.
- What?</font>

286
00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:19.860
<font color="#dcdcdc">There's an old saying. "The first customer
of the day is always the most trouble."</font>

287
00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:21.570
<font color="#dcdcdc">But like I say, I'm in no mood for it,</font>

288
00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:24.950
<font color="#dcdcdc">so I'm gonna treat you so fair and square
that you won't have one human reason...</font>

289
00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:27.200
<font color="#dcdcdc">Can I trade my car in and take another?</font>

290
00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:31.460
<font color="#dcdcdc">Do anything you have a mind to.
Being a woman, you will. That yours?</font>

291
00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:33.830
<font color="#dcdcdc">Yes, it's... There's nothing wrong with it.</font>

292
00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.380
<font color="#dcdcdc">- I just...
- Sick of the sight of it.</font>

293
00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:37.590
<font color="#dcdcdc">Why don't you have a look around here</font>

294
00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:39.090
<font color="#dcdcdc">and see if there's something
that strikes your eyes.</font>

295
00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:41.180
<font color="#dcdcdc">And meanwhile, I'll have my mechanic
give yours the once-over.</font>

296
00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:43.220
<font color="#dcdcdc">- You want some coffee? I was just about...
- No, thank you.</font>

297
00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:45.680
<font color="#dcdcdc">I'm in a hurry
and I just wanna make a change.</font>

298
00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.180
<font color="#dcdcdc">One thing people never ought to be</font>

299
00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.270
<font color="#dcdcdc">when they're buying used cars
and that's in a hurry.</font>

300
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:53.270
<font color="#dcdcdc">But like I said, it's too nice a day to argue.
I'll shoot your car in the garage here.</font>

301
00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:02.490
<i>Notice how the policeman keeps watching,
observing and judging.</i>

302
00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:04.530
<i>And we see Marion looking toward him,</i>

303
00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:08.620
<i>and then we see the policeman
from her point of view once again.</i>

304
00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:13.120
<i>Of course, with digital now, you can
clearly read the address across the street</i>

305
00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:18.880
<i>as the now long gone Sirocco restaurant
and dance club at 4269 Lankershim,</i>

306
00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.380

<font color="#dcdcdc">It looks fine.</font>

308
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:23.550
<font color="#dcdcdc">How much would it be with my car?</font>

309
00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:27.720
<font color="#dcdcdc">You mean you don't want the usual day

310
00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:30.600
<font color="#dcdcdc">You are in a hurry, aren't you?
Somebody chasing you?</font>

311
00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:34.020
<i>The opening half hour of the film
and this particular section,</i>

312
00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.400
<i>and even some of the latter sections
of the film,</i>

313
00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:40.150
<i>are very much in the style
of</i> Alfred Hitchcock Presents <i>episodes,</i>

314
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:44.160
<i>notably one called "One More Mile to Go"
from 1957,</i>

315
00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:48.830
<i>actually directed by Hitchcock
from a teleplay by James Cavanagh,</i>

316
00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:51.290
<i>who was the first screenwriter of</i> Psycho.

317
00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:52.750
<font color="#dcdcdc">All right.</font>

318
00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:00.250
<font color="#dcdcdc">I take it you can prove that car is yours.</font>

319
00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:03.260
<font color="#dcdcdc">I mean, out-of-state licence and all.
You got your pink slip...</font>

320
00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:07.140
<font color="#dcdcdc">I believe I have the necessary papers.
Is there a ladies' room?</font>

321
00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:08.890
<font color="#dcdcdc">In the building.</font>

322
00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:21.570
<font color="#dcdcdc">Over there.</font>

323
00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:32.200
<i>Notice how Hitchcock shoots this sequence
in the bathroom from above.</i>

324
00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:35.040
<i>It's Marion and, once again, a mirror.</i>

325
00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:37.880
<i>Duality, duplicity.</i>

326
00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:41.630
<i>There's her slight hesitation,
is she doing the right thing?</i>

327
00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:44.470
<i>But again, she's in a fugue state.</i>

328
00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:48.760
<i>She's doing this out of impulse.
She doesn't know what she's doing.</i>

329
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:54.180
<i>This, for the actors among you,
is also a good example of space work,</i>

330
00:21:54.640 --> 00:22:00.150
<i>which is a term
that is used by directors and actors to...</i>

331
00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:04.690
<i>It's when an actor will draw in the audience
and the director will draw in the audience</i>

332
00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:10.160
<i>by bringing the camera or the movement
in really close and intensely</i>

333
00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:13.330
<i>so that it involves the audience
in the action.</i>

334
00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:21.040
<font color="#dcdcdc">I think you better take it for a trial spin.</font>

335
00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:23.710
<font color="#dcdcdc">I don't want any bad word of mouth
about California Charlie.</font>

336
00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:26.800
<font color="#dcdcdc">I'd really rather not.
Can't we just settle this and...</font>

337
00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:29.430
<font color="#dcdcdc">I might as well be perfectly
honest with you, ma'am.</font>

338
00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:32.220
<font color="#dcdcdc">- It's not that I don't trust you, but...
- But what?</font>

339
00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:34.140
<font color="#dcdcdc">Is there anything so terribly wrong</font>

340
00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:37.180
<font color="#dcdcdc">about making a decision
and wanting to hurry?</font>

341
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:40.440
<font color="#dcdcdc">- Do you think I've stolen my car?
- No, ma'am.</font>

342
00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:44.070
<i>By the way, if you've ever been curious</i>

343
00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:47.570
<i>about what kind of car
Alfred Hitchcock owned at this time,</i>

344
00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:49.700
<i>this sequence solves the mystery.</i>

345
00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:53.080
<i>Look very closely
and you'll see the black Cadillac Coupe</i>

346
00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:56.370
<i>drives by twice in the same direction.</i>

347
00:22:56.450 --> 00:23:00.460
<i>That's actually Alfred Hitchcock's car
making a cameo appearance.</i>

348
00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:21.980
<font color="#dcdcdc">Hey!</font>

349
00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:31.530
<font color="#dcdcdc">Just put it in here, please.</font>

350
00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:35.910
<font color="#dcdcdc">Thank you.</font>

351
00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:47.380
<i>Heck, Officer, that was the first time
I ever saw the customer</i>

352
00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:49.630
<i>high-pressure the salesman.</i>

353
00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:51.590
<i>Somebody chasing her?</i>

354
00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:54.720
<i>I better have a look at those papers, Charlie.</i>

355
00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:58.350
<i>- She look like a wrong one to you?
- Acted like one.</i>

356
00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:02.390
<i>The only funny thing,
she paid me $700 in cash.</i>

357
00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:16.240
<i>- Yes, Mr Lowery.
- Caroline, Marion still isn't in?</i>

358
00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:19.790
<i>No, Mr Lowery, but then she's always
a bit late on Monday mornings.</i>

359
00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:21.410
<i>Buzz me the minute she comes in.</i>

360
00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:26.710
<i>I always like to call this sequence,
"Marion's long day's journey into night."</i>

361
00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:29.130
<i>It's really an extraordinary sequence</i>

362
00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:32.760
<i>because it's very much
from a subjective point of view,</i>

363
00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:37.050
<i>and we see a very dark journey
that she is about to undertake.</i>

364
00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:42.640
<i>Trips, voyages of any kind,
are very significant in Hitchcock's films.</i>

365
00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:47.190
<i>They usually signify a major change
of life direction for the characters.</i>

366
00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:49.320
<i>When the sequence was being shot,</i>

367
00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:53.570
<i>Hitchcock was voicing characters
right off-screen for Janet Leigh.</i>

368
00:24:56.240 --> 00:25:00.080
<i>Notice how the glare of the headlights
grows increasingly unpleasant.</i>

369
00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:03.660
<i>We feel the character's tension,
her emotional exhaustion.</i>

370
00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:06.290
<i>It's her dark night of the soul,</i>

371
00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:09.750
<i>and Bernard Herrmann's frantic music
hammers away at our nerves.</i>

372
00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:13.380
<i>After all, Cassidy, I told you, all that cash!</i>

373
00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:16.050
<i>I'm not taking the responsibility.</i>

374
00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:17.680
<i>Oh, for heaven's sake.</i>

375
00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:20.720
<i>A girl works for you for 10 years,
you trust her.</i>

376
00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:22.770
<i>All right, yes, you better come over.</i>

377
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:28.230
<i>Well, I ain't about to kiss off $40, 000!</i>

378
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:32.360
<i>I'll get it back, and if any of it's missing,
I'll replace it with her fine, soft flesh!</i>

379
00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:36.990
<i>You wanna keep an eye on the remarkable
and troubling smile that Janet Leigh makes</i>

380
00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:40.780
<i>when her character hears the voice
of the oilman Cassidy saying</i>

381
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:46.460
<i>that if any of the $40, 000 is missing,
he'll replace it with her fine, soft flesh.</i>

382
00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:50.960
<i>It's almost a death-skull smile,
a smile of madness,</i>

383
00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:54.590
<i>and it's one that we will later see repeated
in the last scene of the film</i>

384
00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:57.470
<i>by Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates.</i>

385
00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:00.720
<i>This particular scene was accomplished</i>

386
00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:05.520
<i>by Hitchcock's having the electricians
concoct a 3-foot-wide wheel</i>

387
00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.560
<i>with lights mounted on it.</i>

388
00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:10.900
<i>The wheel had a hub
that could rotate 360 degrees.</i>

389
00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:16.650
<i>And to convey the sense of car headlights
behind Marion going off to camera right,</i>

390
00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:20.700
<i>Hitchcock had the grips
pull the lights away from the car cutout</i>

391
00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:23.830
<i>at an angle and they'd control the spin.</i>

392
00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:26.120
<i>The lights had small baffles
on the end of them,</i>

393
00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:29.120
<i>and they would shut off
once they passed the camera.</i>

394
00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:32.130
<i>So, as you pull the wheel away
to the rear of the stage,</i>

395
00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:37.170
<i>the lights diminished in size until
they were 30 or 40 feet back from the car.</i>

396
00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:41.300
<i>As the trip grows darker and more gothic,
the rains come.</i>

397
00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:43.510
<i>And Bernard Herrmann's music is timed</i>

398
00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:46.350
<i>to the knife-like slash
of the windshield wipers.</i>

399
00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:48.140
<i>Foreshadowing, anyone?</i>

400
00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:51.190
<i>Up ahead looms Bates Motel,</i>

401
00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:55.070
<i>and, unlucky enough, they have a vacancy.</i>

402
00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:07.960
<i>I love the production design for the motel,</i>

403
00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:11.040
<i>the aged, cracked wood,
the lawn chairs nobody sits in,</i>

404
00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:15.880
<i>and the sense of off-road
with the exposed rafter tails of the roof.</i>

405
00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:26.560
<i>Let's salute the production designers,
Joseph Hurley and Robert Clatworthy,</i>

406
00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:29.020
<i>who created the rangy, horizontal hotel</i>

407
00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:31.730
<i>juxtaposed with
the vertical of the Bates house.</i>

408
00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:33.940
<i>These were built on the Universal lot.</i>

409
00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:36.280
<i>The design of the house itself</i>

410
00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:38.530
<i>was influenced
by the Addams Family residence</i>

411
00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:41.570
<i>as seen in Charles Addams' cartoons
in</i> The New Yorker.

412
00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:45.410
<i>But more directly, it was influenced
by Edward Hopper's painting,</i>

413
00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:47.540
<i>the</i> House by the Railroad.

414
00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:52.920
<i>Hitchcock described the architectural style
of the Bates house as "California Gothic."</i>

415
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.330
<i>And this is a quote from him,</i>

416
00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:58.260
<i>"Or when they're particularly awful,
California gingerbread."</i>

417
00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:00.840
<i>Speaking of gothic,</i>

418
00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:05.640
<i>it's in this sequence that</i> Psycho's
<i>full gothic elements really kick in.</i>

419
00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:10.100
<i>A stormy night,
a beautiful traveller lost in a storm,</i>

420
00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:15.270
<i>an old, dark house looming with menace
and a crazy woman inside.</i>

421
00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:20.110
<i>The doors of the</i> Psycho <i>house were from
the Crocker house in San Francisco.</i>

422
00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:21.780
<i>And a tower from the house</i>

423
00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:25.200
<i>was taken from the house
used in the movie</i> Harvey,

424
00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:26.950
<i>which starred James Stewart.</i>

425
00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:31.080
<i>Total cost for the Bates house,
the most expensive design of the film,</i>

426
00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:33.170
<i>$15,000.</i>

427
00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:36.170
<i>The overall effect, though, was priceless.</i>

428
00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:39.590
<i>Robert Clatworthy, by the way,
was Orson Welles' production designer</i>

429
00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:41.340
<i>on</i> Touch of Evil.

430

<font color="#dcdcdc">I knew you must have.</font>

431

432
00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:51.890

<font color="#dcdcdc">We just keep on lighting the lights

It's closer in case you want anything.</font>

437
00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:23.300
<i>Can we possibly say enough good things
about Anthony Perkins in this film?</i>

438
00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:25.590
<i>He's really magnificent playing</i>

439
00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:28.640
<i>the guy that I call
the Hamlet of psychopathic killers.</i>

440
00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:32.930
<i>When screenwriter Joseph Stefano
expressed to Hitchcock</i>

441
00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:37.100
<i>how very disappointed he was
on reading the novel</i> Psycho,

442
00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:40.770
<i>he mentioned what he didn't want to see,
let alone write.</i>

443
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:43.280
<i>He didn't want to see a movie
about a middle-aged,</i>

444
00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:46.200
<i>pudgy, unattractive,
alcoholic Norman Bates,</i>

445
00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:49.950
<i>and that's pretty much the way
the character is described in the book.</i>

446
00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:53.750
<i>Bloch had, in part, based Norman Bates
and his deeds</i>

447
00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:57.120
<i>on those of real-life Wisconsin killer
Ed Gein.</i>

448
00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:59.170
<i>That was the same monster, by the way,</i>

449
00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:02.170
<i>who later inspired</i>
The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

450
00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:04.050
<i>and Hannibal Lecter.</i>

451
00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:08.470
<i>Note the framed prints on the wall.
They're birds.</i>

452
00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:12.390
<i>That's a very good touch
considering Norman's habit of taxidermy.</i>

453
00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:15.560
<i>And bird symbolism
runs throughout the film,</i>

454
00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:20.150
<i>including the opening locale of Phoenix
and the heroine's last name, Crane.</i>

460
00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:37.620
<i>I also love how he says his name
hoping that Marion will call him Norman,</i>

461
00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:38.750
<i>but she doesn't.</i>

462
00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:41.170
<font color="#dcdcdc">You know, nothing special,
just sandwiches and milk.</font>

463
00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:42.750
<font color="#dcdcdc">But I'd like it very much if...</font>

464
00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:46.920
<i>If you think of Norman Bates in the novel,
you would have thought,</i>

465
00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:50.090
<i>"This is probably a role for,
say, Rod Steiger."</i>

466
00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:53.010
<i>But Hitchcock threw Stefano for a loop</i>

467
00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:57.100
<i>by saying, "What if Norman
were to be played by Anthony Perkins?"</i>

468
00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:59.140
<i>That's brilliant casting.</i>

469
00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:03.440
<i>Perkins was 27 years old at the time,
under contract at Paramount,</i>

470
00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:07.650
<i>and a lot of money had been spent
on promoting him as a sensitive,</i>

471
00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:11.320
<i>turbulent, handsome young successor
to James Dean.</i>

472
00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:15.240
<i>Perkins had starred for William Wyler
in</i> Friendly Persuasion,

473
00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:19.920
<i>and he'd played the troubled baseball star
Jimmy Piersall in</i> Fear Strikes Out.

474
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.420
<i>He had also played opposite
Sophia Loren and Audrey Hepburn.</i>

475
00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:28.130
<i>He had a good Broadway stage career
and even recorded several albums,</i>

476
00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:32.680
<i>including having a top 10 hit
with a song called</i> Moonlight Swim.

477
00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:37.310
<i>He was in all the magazines
as a sensitive, off-beat, teen idol.</i>

478
00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:42.560
<i>So, for such a rising actor to take on
a controversial role like Norman Bates,</i>

479
00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:44.820
<i>what a massive career risk,</i>

480
00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:48.240
<i>even if it did involve
working for the great Hitchcock.</i>

481
00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:53.410
<i>Perkins is absolutely brilliant.
He's handsome, he's boyish, he's sad,</i>

482
00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:57.790
<i>he's acutely sensitive, he's terrifying
and he's very fine-tuned.</i>

483
00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:04.500
<i>Notice how there are constant references
to the money.</i>

484
00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:07.090
<i>But the money here is the MacGuffin.</i>

485
00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:10.380
<i>The MacGuffin is the thing
that Hitchcock always had in his films.</i>

486
00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:14.720
<i>The thing that the spies were after,
the thing that the plot was about,</i>

487
00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:19.060
<i>that the audience sort of cared about,
but everyone in the movie was frantic about.</i>

488
00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:22.770
<i>Here the $40,000 is definitely the MacGuffin,</i>

489
00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:27.190
<i>and Hitchcock keeps misdirecting us
into thinking that's what the movie is about.</i>

490
00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:28.690
<i>But, of course, it isn't.</i>

491
00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:32.070
<font color="#dcdcdc">By candlelight, I suppose,
in the cheap, erotic fashion</font>

492
00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:34.490
<font color="#dcdcdc">of young men with cheap, erotic minds!</font>

493
00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:36.200
<font color="#dcdcdc">Mother, please.</font>

494
00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:39.450
<font color="#dcdcdc">And then what, after supper?
Music? Whispers?</font>

495
00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:42.660
<font color="#dcdcdc">Mother, she's just a stranger.
She's hungry and it's raining out.</font>

496
00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:46.170
<font color="#dcdcdc">"Mother, she's just a stranger."
As if men don't desire...</font>

497
00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:51.090
<i>Because surprises and shocks
were so important to Hitchcock in</i> Psycho,

498
00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:55.800
<i>he wanted to misdirect the audience
whenever they saw or heard Mrs Bates.</i>

499
00:32:56.930 --> 00:33:00.060
<i>So, to voice Mrs Bates,
he hired several actresses,</i>

500
00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:03.140
<i>including Virginia Gregg and Jeanette Nolan,</i>

501
00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:07.110
<i>as well as a close friend
of Anthony Perkins, Paul Jasmin.</i>

502
00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:09.690
<i>They all recorded Mother's dialogue.</i>

503
00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:13.320
<i>In post-production,
those voices were blended and edited,</i>

504
00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:17.410
<i>sometimes word for word,
to further disorient the audience.</i>

505
00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:21.370
<i>We hear with Marion
this awful, shrewish diatribe</i>

506
00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:26.210
<i>that not only degrades women,
but also emasculates and demeans Norman.</i>

507
00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:28.420
<i>It's really chilling stuff.</i>

508
00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:50.230
<i>Food and meals
are often significant in Hitchcock.</i>

509
00:33:50.730 --> 00:33:52.150
<i>We hear in Mother's harangue</i>

510
00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:56.610
<i>her association of food and ugly appetite
with sexuality.</i>

511
00:33:57.490 --> 00:33:59.370
<i>Significant things are said,</i>

512
00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:02.240
<i>powerful emotions
are expressed through food</i>

513
00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:06.040
<i>and character-specific choices of food
in Hitchcock films.</i>

514
00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:11.920
<i>Here, it's sandwiches and milk.
How normal, how simple, how American.</i>

515
00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:16.260
<i>And how deeply we are being misled
about Norman Bates.</i>

516
00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:18.220
<font color="#dcdcdc">Don't worry about it.</font>

517
00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:21.890
<font color="#dcdcdc">But as long as you've fixed a supper,
we may as well eat it.</font>

518
00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:36.990
<font color="#dcdcdc">It might be nicer and warmer in the office.</font>

519
00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:52.920
<i>This is one of the most
beautifully acted scenes in all of Hitchcock</i>

520
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.710
<i>and, if you ask me, in all of cinema.</i>

521
00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:59.130
<i>The dynamic between these two characters,
it's wonderful.</i>

522
00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:05.270
<i>It constantly shifts from guarded, to friendly,
to tense, to frightening, to empathetic.</i>

523
00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:09.940
<i>And all the while, the stuffed birds
observe and hover menacingly.</i>

524
00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:13.110
<i>And also those paintings on the wall.</i>

525
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:16.480
<i>They're all about seduction.
They're all about rape.</i>

526
00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:21.660
<i>Another thing I really love about this scene
is the silences, the pauses.</i>

527
00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:23.990
<i>They're almost like Harold Pinter.</i>

528
00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:28.120
<i>There's a sense of late night here,
a kind of only-two-people-in-the-world,</i>

529
00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:32.670
<i>and that gives it an exceptional,
I don't know, intensity and power.</i>

530
00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:36.130
<font color="#dcdcdc">You... You eat like a bird.</font>

531
00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:39.760
<font color="#dcdcdc">And you'd know, of course.</font>

532
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:42.050
<font color="#dcdcdc">No, not really.</font>

533
00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:45.470
<font color="#dcdcdc">Anyway, I hear the expression
"Eats like a bird"</font>

534
00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:49.680
<font color="#dcdcdc">is really a false... Falsity.</font>

535
00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:53.440
<font color="#dcdcdc">Because birds really eat a tremendous lot.</font>

536
00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:59.650
<font color="#dcdcdc">But I don't really know
anything about birds.</font>

537
00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:01.490
<font color="#dcdcdc">My hobby is stuffing things.</font>

538
00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:03.410
<font color="#dcdcdc">You know, taxidermy.</font>

539
00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:07.490
<font color="#dcdcdc">And I guess
I'd just rather stuff birds because</font>

540
00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:10.710
<font color="#dcdcdc">I hate the look of beasts
when they're stuffed.</font>

541
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:12.790
<font color="#dcdcdc">You know, foxes and chimps.</font>

542
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:16.800
<font color="#dcdcdc">Some people even stuff dogs and cats,
but, oh, I can't do that.</font>

543
00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:19.840
<font color="#dcdcdc">I think only birds look
well stuffed because...</font>

544
00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:23.390
<font color="#dcdcdc">Well, because they're
kind of passive to begin with.</font>

545
00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:27.100
<i>Hitchcock, throughout his career,</i>

546
00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:32.770
<i>had a very interesting relationship
with birds and bird imagery in his films.</i>

547
00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:36.400
<i>You see it right from the 1930s.</i>

548
00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:41.700
<i>And, of course, he made one of his
most famous movies in 1963,</i> The Birds,

549
00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:47.160
<i>in which he made the winged avenger
really the focus of the movie.</i>

550
00:36:47.830 --> 00:36:51.870
<i>But in</i> Psycho,
<i>birds have a very, very interesting function.</i>

551
00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:56.880
<i>They are at once observers, they are passive,</i>

552
00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:02.170
<i>they're stuffed,
their power is taken away from them,</i>

553
00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:05.930
<i>but they have a real sense of menace.</i>

554
00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:08.850
<i>In a sense, Norman Bates,</i>

555
00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:13.560
<i>who says he's not very interested in birds
but is interested in stuffing birds,</i>

556
00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:15.980
<i>is himself a bird of prey.</i>

557
00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:20.320
<i>But if you notice his movements,
his gestures,</i>

558
00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:24.740
<i>they're very bird-like and that was deliberate
on the part of Anthony Perkins,</i>

559
00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:28.120
<i>because he was a hugely intelligent actor</i>

560
00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:32.700
<i>who saw that Hitchcock had this
running motif through the film of birds.</i>

561
00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:37.710
<i>As I said, setting the film
in Phoenix, Arizona, mythological bird,</i>

562
00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:41.840
<i>Marion Crane, the name from the novel,
actually Mary Crane in the novel,</i>

563
00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:45.760
<i>but Crane being the name
of a kind of bird, as well.</i>

564
00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:52.220
<i>But in Hitchcock,
birds are kind of an agent of chaos.</i>

565
00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:59.400
<i>Birds appear at moments
when something is about to twist,</i>

566
00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:03.740
<i>something is about to change,
something is about to...</i>

567
00:38:04.570 --> 00:38:07.820
<i>Well, really,
when the bottom is about to fall out.</i>

568
00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:11.870
<i>And you hear and see this
in many of Hitchcock's films.</i>

569
00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:15.370
<i>And it's really worked out beautifully
here in</i> Psycho.

570
00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:19.420
<font color="#dcdcdc">And for all of it, we never budge an inch.</font>

571
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:23.840
<font color="#dcdcdc">Sometimes we deliberately step
into those traps.</font>

572
00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:29.260
<font color="#dcdcdc">I was born in mine. I don't mind it any more.</font>

573
00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:32.010
<font color="#dcdcdc">Oh, but you should. You should mind it.</font>

574
00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:34.470
<font color="#dcdcdc">Oh, I do, but I say I don't.</font>

575
00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:41.480
<font color="#dcdcdc">You know, if anyone ever
talked to me the way I heard,</font>

576
00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:44.320
<font color="#dcdcdc">the way she spoke to you...</font>

577
00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:49.070
<font color="#dcdcdc">Sometimes when she talks to me like that,</font>

578
00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:54.120
<font color="#dcdcdc">I feel I'd like to go up there
and curse her and leave her forever.</font>

579
00:38:54.830 --> 00:38:56.330
<font color="#dcdcdc">Or at least defy her.</font>

580
00:38:56.450 --> 00:38:59.540
Psycho <i>received
mixed to indifferent reviews,</i>

581
00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:04.090
<i>but really it became, overnight,
a watershed box office hit.</i>

582
00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:08.010
<i>It was the kind of movie that people
talked about everywhere you'd go.</i>

583
00:39:08.090 --> 00:39:11.340
<i>It was written about
in all the magazines of the time.</i>

584
00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:15.350
<i>And the film began to be re-evaluated
even when it was in theatres,</i>

585
00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:18.180
<i>probably because
it was making so much money.</i>

586
00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:21.270
<i>It made Hitchcock
an even more enormous public figure</i>

587
00:39:21.350 --> 00:39:23.400
<i>and a very, very rich man.</i>

588
00:39:23.570 --> 00:39:25.650
<font color="#dcdcdc">He left her a little money.</font>

589
00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:30.490
<i>But</i> Psycho <i>haunted Hitchcock
for the rest of his career</i>

590
00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:35.830
<i>because with every succeeding film,
he was judged, mostly unfairly,</i>

591
00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:40.960
<i>on whether that film haunted our dreams
and invaded our psyches</i>

592
00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:42.210
<i>the way</i> Psycho <i>did.</i>

593
00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:43.920
<font color="#dcdcdc">And the way he died...</font>

594
00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:50.680
<font color="#dcdcdc">I guess it's nothing to talk
about while you're eating.</font>

595
00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:55.140
<font color="#dcdcdc">Anyway, it was just too great a loss for her.
She had nothing left.</font>

596
00:39:56.850 --> 00:39:58.310
<font color="#dcdcdc">Except you.</font>

597
00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:02.810
<font color="#dcdcdc">Well, a son is a poor substitute for a lover.</font>

598
00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:05.650
<font color="#dcdcdc">Why don't you go away?</font>

599
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:09.490
<font color="#dcdcdc">To a private island, like you?</font>

600
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:15.490
<font color="#dcdcdc">No, not like me.</font>

601
00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:19.660
<font color="#dcdcdc">I couldn't do that. Who'd look after her?</font>

602
00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:23.290
<font color="#dcdcdc">She'd be alone up there.</font>

603
00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:26.090
<font color="#dcdcdc">Her fire would go out.</font>

604
00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:29.340
<font color="#dcdcdc">It'd be cold and damp like a grave.</font>

605
00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:32.680
<font color="#dcdcdc">If you love someone,</font>

606
00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:36.010
<font color="#dcdcdc">you don't do that to them,
even if you hate them.</font>

607
00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:39.560
<font color="#dcdcdc">You understand, I don't hate her.</font>

608
00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:43.480
<font color="#dcdcdc">I hate what she's become.</font>

609
00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:46.270
<font color="#dcdcdc">I hate the illness.</font>

610
00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:50.400
<font color="#dcdcdc">Wouldn't it be better if you put her</font>

611
00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:53.700
<font color="#dcdcdc">someplace...</font>

612
00:40:56.990 --> 00:41:00.080
<font color="#dcdcdc">You mean an institution? A madhouse?</font>

613
00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:07.710
<font color="#dcdcdc">People always call a madhouse
"someplace," don't they?</font>

614
00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:09.880
<font color="#dcdcdc">Put her in someplace.</font>

615
00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:14.430
<font color="#dcdcdc">I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it to sound uncaring.</font>

616
00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:17.760
<font color="#dcdcdc">What do you know about caring?</font>

617
00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:21.020
<font color="#dcdcdc">Have you ever seen the inside
of one of those places?</font>

618
00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:25.810
<i>I've always been intrigued by
Norman's speech about mental institutions.</i>

619
00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:30.690
<i>How he talks about the laughing and
the tears and the cruel eyes studying you.</i>

620
00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:36.160
<i>It suggests some very first-hand knowledge
of mental institutions on Norman's part.</i>

621
00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:38.370
<i>Has he been committed to one?</i>

622
00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:42.830
<i>But if so, wouldn't the people
of back-fence gossipy Fairvale know that?</i>

623
00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:48.540
<i>It's one of the mysteries of the film.
It's never explained. It's never laid out.</i>

624
00:41:49.210 --> 00:41:53.880
<i>But it just sort of sits there.
It hovers in the air. It's really wonderful.</i>

625
00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:58.510
<i>It's a very powerful conversation
they're having.</i>

626
00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:01.720
<i>Marion, because of what Norman says to her,</i>

627
00:42:01.810 --> 00:42:04.930
<i>makes the decision to return the money
and face the music,</i>

628
00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:08.520
<i>realising we all go a little mad sometimes.</i>

629
00:42:09.690 --> 00:42:12.940
<i>Their madness is only a matter of degree.</i>

630
00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:17.160
<i>These two people are alike.
They're very much like each other.</i>

631
00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:19.530
<font color="#dcdcdc">It's not as if she were</font>

632
00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:22.410
<font color="#dcdcdc">a maniac, a raving thing.</font>

633
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:27.830
<font color="#dcdcdc">She just goes a little mad sometimes.</font>

634
00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:33.340
<font color="#dcdcdc">We all go a little mad sometimes.</font>

635
00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:37.470
<font color="#dcdcdc">Haven't you?</font>

636
00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:40.680
<font color="#dcdcdc">Yes.</font>

637
00:42:41.850 --> 00:42:44.680
<font color="#dcdcdc">Sometimes just one time can be enough.</font>

638
00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:47.810
<font color="#dcdcdc">Thank you.</font>

639
00:42:48.850 --> 00:42:50.980
<font color="#dcdcdc">Thank you, Norman.</font>

640
00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:52.320
<font color="#dcdcdc">Norman.</font>

641
00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:57.450
<font color="#dcdcdc">Oh, you're not going back
to your room already?</font>

642
00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:59.410
<font color="#dcdcdc">I'm very tired.</font>

643
00:42:59.490 --> 00:43:03.330
<font color="#dcdcdc">And I have a long drive tomorrow,
all the way back to Phoenix.</font>

644
00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:04.990
<font color="#dcdcdc">Really?</font>

645
00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:08.830
<font color="#dcdcdc">I stepped into a private trap back there</font>

646
00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:13.290
<font color="#dcdcdc">and I'd like to go back
and try to pull myself out of it</font>

647
00:43:15.090 --> 00:43:16.590
<font color="#dcdcdc">before it's too late for me, too.</font>

648
00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:19.470
<font color="#dcdcdc">Are you sure you wouldn't like
to stay just a little while longer?</font>

649
00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:21.510
<font color="#dcdcdc">Just for talk?</font>

650
00:43:21.970 --> 00:43:23.760
<font color="#dcdcdc">Oh, I'd like to, but...</font>

651
00:43:23.850 --> 00:43:25.140
<font color="#dcdcdc">All right.</font>

652
00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:28.850
<font color="#dcdcdc">Well, I'll see you in the morning.
I'll bring you some breakfast, all right?</font>

653
00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:31.690
<font color="#dcdcdc">- What time?
- Very early. Dawn.</font>

654
00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:33.770
<font color="#dcdcdc">All right, Miss...</font>

655
00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:36.110
<font color="#dcdcdc">- Crane.
- Crane. That's it.</font>

656
00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:37.690
<font color="#dcdcdc">Good night.</font>

657
00:44:11.890 --> 00:44:15.440
<i>Norman is clearly angry
at being lied to by Marion,</i>

658
00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:17.980
<i>and we almost see him becoming his mother</i>

659
00:44:18.070 --> 00:44:21.320
<i>as he listens to her foot falls
in the room next door</i>

660
00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:24.620
<i>and peeps through a hole,
watching her undress.</i>

661
00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:29.250
<i>Voyeurism is presented more darkly
and disturbingly here than in</i> Rear Window,

662
00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:32.830
<i>where one of the characters says that,
"We've become a nation of voyeurs."</i>

663
00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:36.630
<i>In</i> Psycho,
<i>we become an audience of voyeurs.</i>

664
00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:39.090
<i>Hitchcock is proving the point.</i>

665
00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:43.220
<i>We can't turn away.
We know we should, but we don't, do we?</i>

666
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:51.140
<i>Hitchcock knew that the Production Code</i>

667
00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:55.350
<i>would forbid him to show outright
a nude woman in a shower.</i>

668
00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:58.980
<i>So, to design and film the sequence
for maximum impact,</i>

669
00:44:59.070 --> 00:45:04.030
<i>he worked with Saul Bass to lay out
a storyboard and cutting continuity</i>

670
00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:08.080
<i>that would depict the violent
and stunning murder through a montage.</i>

671
00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:12.460
<i>That is the assembly of tiny pieces of film
that, edited together,</i>

672
00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:15.670
<i>convey action
and transmit emotional impact.</i>

673
00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:21.010
<i>He knew, though, that what he suggested
rather than showed,</i>

674
00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:24.180
<i>the audience members would fill in
for themselves.</i>

675
00:45:24.970 --> 00:45:28.390
<i>Hitchcock paid Bass an additional $2,000</i>

676
00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:32.430
<i>to his $10,000 salary to storyboard the ideas.</i>

677
00:45:33.310 --> 00:45:35.440
<i>Hitchcock told his cameraman,</i>

678
00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:38.940
<i>"I'm going to shoot this staccato
and I'm going to cut it staccato</i>

679
00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:42.490
<i>"so the audience won't know
what the hell is going on."</i>

680
00:45:48.530 --> 00:45:53.960
<i>The impact of the shower sequence,
in 1960, was electrifying.</i>

681
00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:57.710
<i>There were screams,
people running up the aisles.</i>

682
00:45:57.790 --> 00:46:02.340
<i>I've never experienced anything like it
in a movie theatre before or since.</i>

683
00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:05.050
<i>It was like an entire audience</i>

684
00:46:05.130 --> 00:46:10.050
<i>was reduced to the state of children
paralysed by fear or dread.</i>

685
00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:11.810
<i>You know, throughout his career,</i>

686
00:46:11.890 --> 00:46:15.310
<i>Hitchcock waged a steady war
against the censors.</i>

687
00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:19.860
<i>They constantly watch-dogged his films
and those of the entire industry.</i>

688
00:46:20.690 --> 00:46:23.110
Psycho <i>was his most
problematic film, though,</i>

689
00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:27.450
<i>because he very much meant to mess
with our Victorian hang-ups</i>

690
00:46:27.530 --> 00:46:32.240
<i>about such things as the bathroom and
the sanctity of motherhood and the family.</i>

691
00:46:32.330 --> 00:46:35.500
<i>It's probably hard for modern viewers
to appreciate that</i>

692
00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:37.290
<i>in the era in which</i> Psycho <i>was made,</i>

693
00:46:37.370 --> 00:46:41.210
<i>no American film had ever before
shown a toilet onscreen.</i>

694
00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:47.800
<i>Well, not only did Hitchcock mean
to show a toilet, he meant to flush it,</i>

695
00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:52.760
<i>both for purposes of the plot
as well as to deeply unsettle the audience.</i>

696
00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:55.310
<i>I remember seeing</i> Psycho <i>in the '60s</i>

697
00:46:55.390 --> 00:46:58.980
<i>and to this day,
I can hear the uneasy, nervous laughter</i>

698
00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:02.360
<i>and the reactions to Janet Leigh
flushing the toilet.</i>

699
00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:07.780
<i>After the very adult opening sequence
of the film and the flushing of the toilet,</i>

700
00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:13.120
<i>it was as if Hitchcock were announcing
to the audience, "Watch out, anything goes."</i>

701
00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:18.160
<i>Well, that message rippled
through the audience like an earthquake.</i>

702
00:47:18.250 --> 00:47:21.630
<i>And to prove it,
we have the shower sequence,</i>

703
00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:26.340
<i>one of the all-time brilliant
and iconic sequences in the history of film.</i>

704
00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:46.570
<font color="#dcdcdc">No!</font>

705
00:47:49.110 --> 00:47:50.240
<font color="#dcdcdc">No!</font>

706
00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:13.390
<i>Hitchcock and his screenwriter
got into a battle royal about a shot</i>

707
00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:17.260
<i>that Hitchcock edited out of the film
to appease the censors.</i>

708
00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:21.730
<i>For this sequence, there was going to be
an overhead God's-eye view of Marion</i>

709
00:48:21.810 --> 00:48:26.860
<i>as she is dead, naked
and sprawled across the bathroom floor.</i>

710
00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:32.490
<i>Now Stefano thought that part of the scene
was heartbreaking and absolutely essential.</i>

711
00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:37.280
<i>But Hitchcock cut it to divert the censors
from other things in the scene.</i>

712
00:48:37.370 --> 00:48:43.330
<i>Notably the fact that at one moment,
the knife absolutely does penetrate the body,</i>

713
00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:46.040
<i>and also, there is a glimpse of nipple.</i>

714
00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:50.630
<i>Stefano almost never forgave Hitchcock
for cutting that scene out,</i>

715
00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:53.840
<i>because he thought
it was so emotionally powerful.</i>

716
00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:56.720
<i>By the way, at the time of the filming
of the shower sequence,</i>

717
00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:58.890
<i>Anthony Perkins was in New York</i>

718
00:48:58.970 --> 00:49:03.520
<i>rehearsing to open in a Broadway musical
called</i> Greenwillow,

719
00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:07.480
<i>so the Mother who approaches
the shower curtain and rips it aside</i>

720
00:49:07.570 --> 00:49:12.530
<i>was played not by Perkins,
but by veteran stuntwoman Margo Epper.</i>

721
00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:14.490
<i>Now in the overhead shots,</i>

722
00:49:14.570 --> 00:49:18.330
<i>where Marion Crane is struggling
to ward off Mother's knife,</i>

723
00:49:18.410 --> 00:49:21.120
<i>well, that performer is Anne Dore.</i>

724
00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:25.500
<i>Her film appearances include</i>
Son of Paleface <i>and</i> My Fair Lady.

725
00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:30.000
<i>A</i> Playboy <i>centrefold named Marli Renfro,</i>

726
00:49:30.090 --> 00:49:32.840
<i>she had the same
physical dimensions as Janet,</i>

727
00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:35.010
<i>also filmed on different days.</i>

728
00:49:35.090 --> 00:49:38.100
<i>That was so that Hitchcock's camera
could be placed anywhere,</i>

729
00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:41.810
<i>without concern for the modesty
of a big Hollywood star.</i>

730
00:49:41.890 --> 00:49:44.060
<i>Hitchcock himself held the knife</i>

731
00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:46.730
<i>because he knew exactly
where he wanted it to go.</i>

732
00:49:46.810 --> 00:49:50.440
<i>Janet Leigh told me that,
and most people don't know that.</i>

733
00:49:53.110 --> 00:49:55.490
<font color="#dcdcdc">Mother! Oh, God, Mother!</font>

734
00:49:55.570 --> 00:49:57.410
<font color="#dcdcdc">Blood! Blood!</font>

735
00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:17.550
<i>When I was doing research for my book</i>
Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho,

736
00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:22.220
<i>I was fascinated to read
Hitchcock's detailed notes</i>

737
00:50:22.310 --> 00:50:24.980
<i>for sound and music for the picture.</i>

738
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:29.440
<i>He, before the edit happened, would dictate</i>

739
00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:32.650
<i>exactly where he thought
there should be sound and music</i>

740
00:50:32.730 --> 00:50:37.780
<i>and expected his collaborators
to pretty much follow his rule.</i>

741
00:50:38.410 --> 00:50:41.910
<i>Well, Bernard Herrmann wasn't the type
to follow anybody's rule,</i>

742
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:46.460
<i>and he was right at this point,
because Hitchcock said</i>

743
00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:50.330
<i>that the shower sequence should have
absolutely no music whatsoever.</i>

744
00:50:51.130 --> 00:50:55.710
<i>But Hitchcock, to his credit,
later said to Herrmann that he was right</i>

745
00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:59.680
<i>and his original suggestion
for no music had been,</i>

746
00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:02.640
<i>quote, "An inappropriate suggestion."</i>

747
00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:19.200
Psycho <i>won
four Academy Award nominations:</i>

748
00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:23.240
<i>Janet Leigh for Best Supporting Actress,
one for set decoration,</i>

749
00:51:23.330 --> 00:51:25.290
<i>one for black and white cinematography,</i>

750
00:51:25.370 --> 00:51:28.910
<i>and one for Alfred Hitchcock
as Best Director.</i>

751
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.790
<i>No nomination for Anthony Perkins,</i>

752
00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:34.340
<i>no nomination
for Bernard Herrmann's music.</i>

753
00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:36.340
<i>That's pretty unthinkable.</i>

754
00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:40.550
<i>And Hitchcock sent a note
to Anthony Perkins that said,</i>

755
00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:43.300
<i>"I am ashamed of your fellow actors."</i>

756
00:51:44.350 --> 00:51:50.020
<i>Perkins and Hitchcock worked very well
together for this particular sequence.</i>

757
00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:53.650
<i>Perkins had a lot of ideas that were his own,</i>

758
00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:58.570
<i>very specific ideas
about behaviour and movements,</i>

759
00:51:58.650 --> 00:52:02.700
<i>and although Hitchcock was very adamant
about a pre-plan</i>

760
00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:05.660
<i>in terms of where the camera would move</i>

761
00:52:05.740 --> 00:52:08.200
<i>and he had all of this storyboarded</i>

762
00:52:08.290 --> 00:52:11.670
<i>as, indeed, he had the entire film
storyboarded perfectly,</i>

763
00:52:12.370 --> 00:52:17.210
<i>Perkins had some very interesting ideas,
and Hitchcock, to his credit,</i>

764
00:52:18.050 --> 00:52:20.340
<i>thought that Perkins
was a very intelligent guy</i>

765
00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:23.680
<i>and would say to him,
"Have you thought it out?</i>

766
00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:28.640
<i>"Does it really seem in character for you?"
And Perkins would say, "Yes."</i>

767
00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:32.060
<i>And Hitchcock would let him
go ahead and do that.</i>

768
00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:38.820
<i>In various parts of the film, you will see
Anthony Perkins chewing candy,</i>

769
00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:43.200
<i>and that was his own idea.
It's certainly not in the script.</i>

770
00:52:43.950 --> 00:52:46.410
<i>Perkins felt it was a bird-like thing to do,</i>

771
00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:51.330
<i>and since there is so much bird symbology
and imagery in the movie,</i>

772
00:52:51.410 --> 00:52:55.170
<i>Hitchcock thought it was a great idea
that Perkins had,</i>

773
00:52:55.250 --> 00:53:00.340
<i>and it was Hitchcock's idea to make
the snack that he was eating candy corn,</i>

774
00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:02.340
<i>because he thought
that's what a chicken would do,</i>

775
00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:05.390
<i>and he thought that Perkins
had a neck like a chicken.</i>

776
00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:11.930
<i>In this sequence,
Perkins had a very specific idea,</i>

777
00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:14.900
<i>which was almost kind of a Lady Macbeth</i>

778
00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:18.360
<i>washing out the blood
and washing out the guilt.</i>

779
00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:24.740
<i>He also felt that it married with Janet Leigh's
washing off the guilt of the theft</i>

780
00:53:24.820 --> 00:53:27.370
<i>in the shower sequence that just preceded it.</i>

781
00:53:27.450 --> 00:53:33.750
<i>And Perkins was very, very smart about
realising that there was a great similarity,</i>

782
00:53:33.830 --> 00:53:37.500
<i>in terms of the characters
of Marion Crane and Norman Bates,</i>

783
00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:43.220
<i>a great similarity in their characters,
and he wanted to play upon that.</i>

784
00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:47.220
<i>And, so, that's why he had the sense</i>

785
00:53:47.890 --> 00:53:53.100
<i>of wanting to present Norman Bates
as wanting to wash away a crime,</i>

786
00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:57.060
<i>wanting to wash away every kind of clue,</i>

787
00:53:57.150 --> 00:54:01.320
<i>any bit of evidence that Mother
had ever done something so heinous.</i>

788
00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:06.910
<i>And I remember seeing the film
back in the 1960s</i>

789
00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:10.200
<i>and actually hearing women behind me...</i>

790
00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:13.250
<i>I don't know why the memory of this
is so clear, but it is.</i>

791
00:54:13.330 --> 00:54:18.250
<i>But hearing the memory of a woman saying,
"What a good boy he is.</i>

792
00:54:18.330 --> 00:54:22.420
<i>"What a good boy he is."
Because he was cleaning up after Mother.</i>

793
00:54:23.090 --> 00:54:26.970
<i>And, so, Hitchcock knew very, very well</i>

794
00:54:27.050 --> 00:54:30.100
<i>that Americans have this issue</i>

795
00:54:30.350 --> 00:54:33.310
<i>or these issues
about bathroom and cleanliness.</i>

796
00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:39.190
<i>And, so, he felt that he would hook
audiences into Norman's dilemma</i>

797
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:42.820
<i>by really emphasising this clean-up matter.</i>

798
00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:54.540
<i>Now this particular moment,
all of these moments,</i>

799
00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:57.370
<i>as he gets in the car
and moves toward the swamp,</i>

800
00:54:57.460 --> 00:55:01.540
<i>once again have brought
a lot of comparisons with</i>

801
00:55:01.630 --> 00:55:05.590
<i>the "One More Mile to Go" episode
of</i> Alfred Hitchcock Presents.

802
00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:09.130
<i>That was a very famous one
in which the actor David Wayne</i>

803
00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:14.720
<i>plays a man who murders a shrewish wife
and disposes of her body</i>

804
00:55:15.310 --> 00:55:19.560
<i>very much in the way Norman Bates
is disposing of the body of Marion Crane,</i>

805
00:55:19.650 --> 00:55:23.860
<i>by putting her in the trunk of a car
and by driving her somewhere.</i>

806
00:55:24.650 --> 00:55:27.530
<i>In the episode
"One More Mile to Go," though,</i>

807
00:55:27.610 --> 00:55:33.660
<i>the drive, the journey becomes
the big suspense element of the piece,</i>

808
00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:39.330
<i>just as the drive in</i> Psycho
<i>of Marion Crane to the motel</i>

809
00:55:39.410 --> 00:55:42.080
<i>is a big suspense element of the piece.</i>

810
00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:50.380
<i>Hitchcock loved the idea
of swamps and bathrooms.</i>

811
00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:53.850
<i>Although they don't seem like
big deals now,</i>

812
00:55:53.930 --> 00:55:56.010
<i>they seemed very big deals back then,</i>

813
00:55:56.100 --> 00:56:01.100
<i>because this is a film that really explores
the underbelly, the underneath,</i>

814
00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:06.440
<i>the dark psyche of all of us,</i>

815
00:56:07.730 --> 00:56:14.280
<i>and Hitchcock felt that by showing things
like toilets and a strange dark swamp,</i>

816
00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:18.040
<i>which we're about to see,
he would be unsettling the audience</i>

817
00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:22.210
<i>and really dealing with issues
of bodily functions</i>

818
00:56:22.290 --> 00:56:25.630
<i>which are things
that Americans, still to this day,</i>

819
00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:29.800
<i>don't talk about that much
but certainly didn't in 1960.</i>

820
00:56:36.220 --> 00:56:39.730
<i>You see Norman is very, very shrewd
and smart and calculating.</i>

821
00:56:39.810 --> 00:56:45.150
<i>He knows exactly what things could be
the things that would trip him up.</i>

822
00:56:45.900 --> 00:56:48.820
<i>Did she use the medicine cabinet?
What's in the drawers?</i>

823
00:56:50.530 --> 00:56:52.570
<i>This is a really good sequence, too,</i>

824
00:56:52.650 --> 00:56:58.450
<i>for illustrating what Hitchcock loved
to talk about as icebox talk.</i>

825
00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:02.660
<i>And what he meant by that is,
these are the things that</i>

826
00:57:03.330 --> 00:57:08.630
<i>a guy and his wife would argue about
when they would go home from the theatre.</i>

827
00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:14.050
<i>"Well, why didn't he check the drawers?
Why didn't he look in the bathroom?"</i>

828
00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:16.850
<i>And he was very cognizant of that,</i>

829
00:57:16.930 --> 00:57:19.680
<i>and, so, he was always thinking
of the audience.</i>

830
00:57:19.770 --> 00:57:23.190
<i>And, so, if he or the screenwriter
would forget,</i>

831
00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:26.440
<i>he would always constantly say,
"What would the audience be thinking?</i>

832
00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:29.780
<i>"What would the audience
be trying to second-guess at this point?</i>

833
00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:34.110
<i>"Why didn't the character do this?
Why didn't the character do that?"</i>

834
00:57:53.550 --> 00:57:58.970
<i>Here, in a sequence where you see
he does very detailed, specific movement,</i>

835
00:57:59.050 --> 00:58:01.850
<i>he's really doing a number of things.</i>

836
00:58:01.930 --> 00:58:06.480
<i>He's shifting our identification
to Norman Bates as a character.</i>

837
00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:10.980
<i>He's, right now, playing with the idea
of the money.</i>

838
00:58:11.070 --> 00:58:13.780
<i>The entire audience is going,
"Oh, the money, the money.</i>

839
00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:14.900
<i>"He's going to take the money."</i>

840
00:58:14.990 --> 00:58:17.950
<i>But he doesn't know about the money.
He thinks it's a newspaper.</i>

841
00:58:18.030 --> 00:58:23.950
<i>So, he tosses it in the trunk.
It is, as I said earlier, the MacGuffin.</i>

842
00:58:24.750 --> 00:58:28.170
<i>It's the thing that sets the plot in motion
but it isn't the plot.</i>

843
00:58:28.250 --> 00:58:30.630
<i>It isn't what the plot is about at all.</i>

844
00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:48.190
<i>Now, he does a very daring thing here
and Perkins plays it beautifully,</i>

845
00:58:48.270 --> 00:58:54.990
<i>which is, he's almost wanting to test
our identification with Norman Bates.</i>

846
00:58:55.070 --> 00:58:57.200
<i>Have we really made the identification?</i>

847
00:58:57.280 --> 00:59:01.780
<i>Have we made the switch
to Norman as our figure?</i>

848
00:59:02.530 --> 00:59:07.410
<i>And as Norman pushes the car
into the swamp,</i>

849
00:59:09.750 --> 00:59:11.630
<i>you'll see in a second,</i>

850
00:59:11.710 --> 00:59:15.510
<i>it's a really wonderful,
typically Hitchcockian thing to do.</i>

851
00:59:17.300 --> 00:59:18.930
<i>He pushes it in.</i>

852
00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:23.810
<i>This, by the way, was done
with a hydraulic kind of mechanism.</i>

853
00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:28.230
<i>Once the car went into the swamp,
which was on the backlot at Universal,</i>

854
00:59:28.310 --> 00:59:31.610
<i>it would hook onto a hydraulic device,</i>

855
00:59:31.690 --> 00:59:34.900
<i>which was built for the film,
and pulled down.</i>

856
00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:38.990
<i>Now, audiences were biting their nails</i>

857
00:59:39.070 --> 00:59:43.160
<i>right along with Perkins,
who is also chewing candy.</i>

858
00:59:43.990 --> 00:59:48.500
<i>And at a certain point,
the car is going to stop.</i>

859
00:59:52.130 --> 00:59:57.420
<i>And at that point, audiences were laughing,
giggling nervously.</i>

860
00:59:58.010 --> 00:59:59.630
<i>What's going to happen?</i>

861
00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:04.100
<i>That's when Hitchcock knew.
As he was testing this movie with audiences</i>

862
01:00:05.010 --> 01:00:09.140
<i>and the car begins to sink
and they laugh with relief,</i>

863
01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:12.270
<i>he knew that the audience
had finally switched over to Norman.</i>

864
01:00:12.350 --> 01:00:15.860
<i>We're rooting for him.
We want him to get away with it.</i>

865
01:00:16.730 --> 01:00:20.030
<i>That's a pretty audacious cinematic device.</i>

866
01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:30.410
<i>By the way, I nearly bought
Marion Crane's car a few years ago.</i>

867
01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:36.040
<i>It actually came up for auction,
and it came with a certificate of authenticity,</i>

868
01:00:36.130 --> 01:00:40.800
<i>as well as a little bill
from Hitchcock for $150</i>

869
01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:44.220
<i>saying how much it had cost him
to clean the engine.</i>

870
01:00:45.050 --> 01:00:50.230
<i>I didn't actually bid, finally,
because I didn't have a garage at the time,</i>

871
01:00:50.310 --> 01:00:54.860
<i>and I thought that the</i> Psycho <i>car
should have the same kind of preservation</i>

872
01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:58.610
<i>and immaculate care
that Mrs Bates' corpse had.</i>

873
01:00:58.690 --> 01:01:01.070
<i>So, I decided against buying it.</i>

874
01:01:04.530 --> 01:01:05.700
<font color="#dcdcdc">Sam?</font>

875
01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:08.700
<font color="#dcdcdc">Sam! Lady wants to see you.</font>

876
01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:15.960
<font color="#dcdcdc">Yes, miss?</font>

877
01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:20.670
<i>We're introduced now to Vera Miles,
who plays Marion's sister.</i>

878
01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:24.680
<i>Miles had worked with much success
in Hollywood,</i>

879
01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:28.260
<i>with John Ford, especially,
in several of his Westerns.</i>

880
01:01:28.810 --> 01:01:33.440
<i>But Hitchcock used her in a TV episode
called "Revenge,"</i>

881
01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:37.480
<i>and he signed her to a long-term contract,</i>

882
01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:40.650
<i>wanting to build her up
as his next Grace Kelly.</i>

883
01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:45.160
<i>However, Vera Miles became pregnant
and couldn't do</i> Vertigo,

884
01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:50.240
<i>which had been designed for her,
and Hitchcock lost interest in her.</i>

885
01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:52.500
<i>But he still had her under contract</i>

886
01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:55.710
<i>and he thought he would use her
here in</i> Psycho.

887
01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:00.960
<i>He remained cordial and icy with her,
but he never quite forgave her.</i>

888
01:02:01.050 --> 01:02:04.130
<i>And Miles is not only beautiful,
but a terrific actress.</i>

889
01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:09.470
<i>I should point out that Hitchcock
didn't lavish the kind of attention</i>

890
01:02:09.550 --> 01:02:16.060
<i>to John Gavin and Vera Miles that he did
to Anthony Perkins and to Janet Leigh.</i>

891
01:02:16.310 --> 01:02:19.060
<i>And he considered these two characters
stick figures,</i>

892
01:02:19.150 --> 01:02:21.400
<i>who were really audience surrogates</i>

893
01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:24.950
<i>that would take the audience
through the rest of the mystery.</i>

894
01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:30.330
<i>But Vera Miles is such a good actress
that she makes this character her own.</i>

895
01:02:30.830 --> 01:02:35.660
<i>And she's beautifully matched
by Martin Balsam,</i>

896
01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:40.670
<i>who has just entered the scene
as Arbogast, the private investigator.</i>

897
01:02:41.170 --> 01:02:44.670
<i>He was trained at the Actors Studio,
and he made his debut in</i> On the Waterfront,

898
01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:50.430
<i>and watch what humanity and intelligence
and wit and world-weariness</i>

899
01:02:50.510 --> 01:02:53.560
<i>Balsam brings to the role. He's really superb.</i>

900
01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:57.890
<i>It's a role that could've been, I don't know,
just merely expository.</i>

901
01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:02.570
<i>Yet he turns it into a wonderful
kind of fully-rounded characterisation.</i>

902
01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:08.860
<i>And he's especially good in this scene
at being condescending to people</i>

903
01:03:08.950 --> 01:03:12.660
<i>that he sees as small-town,
because he's hip and urban.</i>

904
01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:14.790
<font color="#dcdcdc">Not even a hunch. Just hope.</font>

905
01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:18.420
<font color="#dcdcdc">Well, with a little checking
I could get to believe you.</font>

906
01:03:18.830 --> 01:03:21.290
<font color="#dcdcdc">I don't care if you believe me or not.</font>

907
01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:24.710
<font color="#dcdcdc">All I want to do is see Marion
before she gets in this too deeply.</font>

908
01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:28.260
<font color="#dcdcdc">Did you check in Phoenix? Hospitals?
Maybe she had an accident, or a holdup.</font>

909
01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:30.220
<font color="#dcdcdc">No, she was seen leaving town
in her own car,</font>

910
01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:32.550
<font color="#dcdcdc">by her employer, I might add.</font>

911
01:03:33.010 --> 01:03:35.270
<font color="#dcdcdc">I can't believe it. Can you?</font>

912
01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:40.940
<i>Martin Balsam, of course, was brilliant
in basically everything he did,</i>

913
01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:46.230
Breakfast at Tiffany's, A Thousand Clowns,
<i>for which he got an Oscar, and</i> Catch-22.

914
01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:49.610
<i>When I was writing</i>
Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho,

915
01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:54.240
<i>he declined to be interviewed for the book,
and he was one of the very few who did,</i>

916
01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:59.620
<i>and I understood that he was very weary
of being asked about one film</i>

917
01:03:59.710 --> 01:04:02.170
<i>as if it superseded everything he had done.</i>

918
01:04:02.250 --> 01:04:05.300
<i>So, I understood, but I really regretted it.</i>

919
01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:15.470
<i>You know,
when otherwise sensible actors and writers</i>

920
01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:19.560
<i>talk about Hitchcock
not being a good actor's director,</i>

921
01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:22.730
<i>I like to point out this sequence</i>

922
01:04:22.810 --> 01:04:28.280
<i>between Perkins
and the wonderful Martin Balsam in</i> Psycho.

923
01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:31.530
<i>I could point out dozens of other scenes
in his films,</i>

924
01:04:31.610 --> 01:04:34.450
<i>but it's ludicrous on the face of it,</i>

925
01:04:35.450 --> 01:04:39.700
<i>because here you have two actors
really working at the top of their craft.</i>

926
01:04:39.790 --> 01:04:44.540
<i>Earlier I had talked about
Perkins coming to Hitchcock several times</i>

927
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:48.050
<i>and having ideas about how to play scenes.</i>

928
01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:52.090
<i>That's the kind of thing that Hitchcock
would often cut off at the knees</i>

929
01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:56.640
<i>if he didn't think the actor was intelligent
and really in tune with the character.</i>

930
01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:59.310
<i>But he liked Perkins immensely</i>

931
01:04:59.390 --> 01:05:03.440
<i>and thought he was extraordinarily bright
and in tune with this role.</i>

932
01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:07.730
<i>In fact, he told him at the beginning,
before the picture started shooting,</i>

933
01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:09.530
<i>that he was the movie</i>

934
01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:13.150
<i>and that if he didn't work,
the movie didn't work.</i>

935
01:05:14.030 --> 01:05:17.780
<i>I love how Perkins
talked with Hitchcock about,</i>

936
01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:21.040
<i>"Would it be okay if he stuttered
and stammered over certain words</i>

937
01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:24.460
<i>"that gave him trouble
like 'invalid' or 'falsity'?"</i>

938
01:05:24.830 --> 01:05:29.550
<i>Hitchcock, of course, loved the idea,
and Perkins followed through beautifully.</i>

939
01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:34.010
<i>It was also Perkins' idea, as I said,</i>

940
01:05:34.090 --> 01:05:39.100
<i>to peck like a bird on candy corn.</i>

941
01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:41.520
<i>The candy corn was Hitchcock's idea.</i>

942
01:05:41.930 --> 01:05:45.560
<i>But the real juice in this scene,
although it's beautifully written,</i>

943
01:05:45.650 --> 01:05:51.190
<i>is supplied by the pace
and the rhythms between the actors.</i>

944
01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:57.410
<i>The first time they did this scene, they did it
pretty much as Stefano had written it</i>

945
01:05:57.490 --> 01:06:00.030
<i>and Hitchcock had storyboarded it.</i>

946
01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:04.330
<i>And it was done with a lot of single shots</i>

947
01:06:05.540 --> 01:06:09.460
<i>and movements that Hitchcock
had prescribed in his storyboards.</i>

948
01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:13.470
<i>When they finished,
the entire crew burst into applause.</i>

949
01:06:14.050 --> 01:06:17.300
<i>Perkins went to Hitchcock, though, and said</i>

950
01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:19.850
<i>"Marty and I have been working on this,</i>

951
01:06:19.930 --> 01:06:24.520
<i>"and we have done something a little more
improvisational and a little looser,</i>

952
01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:28.560
<i>"but we talk over each other.
Would you mind very much if we tried it?"</i>

953
01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:33.070
<i>Hitchcock didn't mind.
He trusted both these actors.</i>

954
01:06:33.150 --> 01:06:37.740
<i>And they did the scene again
in the style that we're seeing it.</i>

955
01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:41.910
<i>There were still, of course,
these storyboarded moments like this</i>

956
01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:44.250
<i>that Hitchcock and Perkins worked out.</i>

957
01:06:44.330 --> 01:06:47.580
<i>They wanted to exploit
his sort of chicken-like neck.</i>

958
01:06:48.750 --> 01:06:53.000
<i>But the scene as it was shot the second time
was looser,</i>

959
01:06:53.090 --> 01:06:57.720
<i>a little more, I was going to say
improvisational but not really,</i>

960
01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:00.970
<i>but it has a looser kind of rhythm and tone.</i>

961
01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:06.680
<i>Well, once they shot the scene, once again
the crew burst into even bigger applause.</i>

962
01:07:06.770 --> 01:07:09.690
<i>Hitchcock loved it,
and he took the storyboards,</i>

963
01:07:10.230 --> 01:07:13.610
<i>tore them up and threw them
into the waste paper basket.</i>

964
01:07:13.690 --> 01:07:16.150
<i>So much for Hitchcock being dictatorial</i>

965
01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:18.610
<i>and thinking that actors
were cattle and stupid</i>

966
01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:21.780
<i>and that they only needed
to be put through their paces.</i>

967
01:07:21.870 --> 01:07:24.410
<i>He truly respected both of these actors,</i>

968
01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:30.000
<i>and this scene is beautifully done.
It's tense, it's funny,</i>

969
01:07:31.130 --> 01:07:33.920
<i>there's a strange kind of seduction
that goes on,</i>

970
01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.630
<i>and it really couldn't be better.</i>

971
01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:42.890
<i>Later, in 1962,
Hitchcock used Martin Balsam again</i>

972
01:07:42.970 --> 01:07:45.180
<i>to do a screen test for Tippi Hedren</i>

973
01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:49.140
<i>when he was considering her
as the leading lady for</i> The Birds.

974
01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:54.860
<i>He's wonderful in that, too,
because he has a very, once again,</i>

975
01:07:55.570 --> 01:08:01.200
<i>laid back, very conversational style
that puts another actor at ease.</i>

976
01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:04.410
<i>These two actors loved working together,</i>

977
01:08:04.490 --> 01:08:07.790
<i>and this is really one of the best scenes
in the movie.</i>

978
01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:11.420
<i>Superbly acted, very slyly done</i>

979
01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:15.960
<i>and it's a real cat-and-mouse game
between two terrific actors.</i>

980
01:08:18.670 --> 01:08:23.180
<i>Perkins loved working with Hitchcock
so very much</i>

981
01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:28.350
<i>that he actually suggested that they do</i>
Psycho <i>together as a Broadway play,</i>

982
01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:31.190
<i>because he thought
the script was well-written</i>

983
01:08:31.270 --> 01:08:34.440
<i>and that the material
would transfer to the stage well.</i>

984
01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:36.610
<i>And Hitchcock had some interest in that
for a time,</i>

985
01:08:36.690 --> 01:08:39.780
<i>but he could never figure out
how to do the big shock scenes,</i>

986
01:08:39.860 --> 01:08:43.870
<i>the shower sequence
and the death of the detective.</i>

987
01:08:44.370 --> 01:08:49.450
<i>Perkins also brought Hitchcock
a project called</i> The Man Who Lost His Head

988
01:08:49.540 --> 01:08:52.460
<i>and hoped that they would do it
as their second film together,</i>

989
01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:54.540
<i>but nothing came of it.</i>

990
01:08:55.710 --> 01:08:58.670
<i>In the mid-'60s,
Hitchcock contacted Robert Bloch,</i>

991
01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:01.170
<i>who was the original author
of the novel</i> Psycho,

992
01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:05.300
<i>and wanted to do
a kind of successor to</i> Psycho,

993
01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:09.770
<i>grafting elements of the real life
British murderers Haigh and Christie</i>

994
01:09:09.850 --> 01:09:14.310
<i>into a story of a young psychopath
a bit like Norman Bates.</i>

995
01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:18.020
<i>That wasn't going to be
for Anthony Perkins ever,</i>

996
01:09:18.110 --> 01:09:22.150
<i>but the project eventually became
something called</i> Kaleidoscope

997
01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:24.910
<i>and Hitchcock commissioned
several scripts,</i>

998
01:09:24.990 --> 01:09:28.580
<i>but Universal actually stopped the film
from being made.</i>

999
01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:33.290
<i>Hitchcock wanted to do something
that was very much like</i> Blowup,

1000
01:09:33.370 --> 01:09:35.670
<i>Michelangelo Antonioni's movie,</i>

1001
01:09:36.250 --> 01:09:40.710
<i>something with really good actors
who were young and kind of unknown.</i>

1002
01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:46.720
<i>And he wanted to shoot it in a very loose,
grainy, gritty, improvisational style...</i>

1003
01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:48.850
<i>That word comes up again.</i>

1004
01:09:48.930 --> 01:09:52.680
<i>But Universal thought it was a mistake,</i>

1005
01:09:52.770 --> 01:09:54.690
<i>and they really pulled the plug
on the project,</i>

1006
01:09:54.770 --> 01:09:56.900
<i>and that was very difficult for Hitchcock.</i>

1007
01:09:56.980 --> 01:09:58.520
<font color="#dcdcdc">People just come and go, you know.</font>

1008
01:09:58.610 --> 01:10:02.190
<font color="#dcdcdc">- That's right. She isn't still here, is she?
- No.</font>

1009
01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:07.240
<i>They have a marvellous chemistry
in this scene,</i>

1010
01:10:07.530 --> 01:10:13.290
<i>and Perkins turns on the boyish charm,
and we can see that for a minute</i>

1011
01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.750
<i>the character of Arbogast buys it,
but then he is too shrewd.</i>

1012
01:10:19.210 --> 01:10:23.380
<i>He realises that all that charm and diffidence
is covering something else up,</i>

1013
01:10:24.090 --> 01:10:26.470
<i>and it's standing in the window.</i>

1014
01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:35.770
<i>By the way, Perkins asked Alfred Hitchcock</i>

1015
01:10:35.850 --> 01:10:38.730
<i>if he could wear his own clothes
in the movie.</i>

1016
01:10:38.810 --> 01:10:44.610
<i>There were specific things chosen
for Norman Bates to wear,</i>

1017
01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:47.410
<i>but Perkins had some specific ideas</i>

1018
01:10:47.490 --> 01:10:49.870
<i>about what he thought
the character should wear.</i>

1019
01:10:49.950 --> 01:10:52.330
<i>And what he thought
the character should wear</i>

1020
01:10:52.410 --> 01:10:57.170
<i>is very much like the kind of thing
that he wore when he wasn't filming.</i>

1021
01:10:57.250 --> 01:11:01.540
<font color="#dcdcdc">Now, if this girl, Marion Crane, were here,
you wouldn't be hiding her, would you?</font>

1022
01:11:01.630 --> 01:11:03.800
<font color="#dcdcdc">- No.
- Not even if she paid you well?</font>

1023
01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:04.960
<font color="#dcdcdc">No.</font>

1024
01:11:05.210 --> 01:11:09.590
<i>Hitchcock loved the idea of filming
a lot of this picture</i>

1025
01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:11.760
<i>with night-time as the backdrop.</i>

1026
01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:19.480
<i>And while that gives the film a really strong,
edgy, interesting black and white mode,</i>

1027
01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:23.360
<i>it did cause some problems
in terms of lighting.</i>

1028
01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:27.320
<i>There is one sequence at the Bates Motel</i>

1029
01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:31.120
<i>where Hitchcock wanted
very indirect kind of lighting.</i>

1030
01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:36.910
<i>And unfortunately, one of the light stands
actually showed in the shot</i>

1031
01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.420
<i>and Hitchcock read his crew the riot act.</i>

1032
01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:45.130
<i>You don't really notice it in the film
unless you watch it very, very carefully,</i>

1033
01:11:45.210 --> 01:11:49.050
<i>but when Marion first drives up to the motel,</i>

1034
01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:53.680
<i>there is kind of a light in the parking lot
that you wonder why it's there.</i>

1035
01:11:57.100 --> 01:12:01.230
<i>But here again, you see very strong light,</i>

1036
01:12:02.650 --> 01:12:07.900
<i>very shadowy, chiaroscuro kind of lighting
that Hitchcock really loved for this picture.</i>

1037
01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:13.240
<i>The cinematography by John Russell
was one of the film's Oscar nominations,</i>

1038
01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:17.540
<i>and you can see why,
although some critics at the time</i>

1039
01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:21.290
<i>said that the film was shot
in a very TV-like style.</i>

1040
01:12:21.370 --> 01:12:25.800
<i>You can tell that the lighting
is far more careful and far more moody</i>

1041
01:12:26.250 --> 01:12:31.260
<i>than the standard TV episode lighting
of the day.</i>

1042
01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:36.430
<i>You always get the sense with Hitchcock
that he knows where the camera should be.</i>

1043
01:12:36.510 --> 01:12:40.020
<i>The camera is never in the wrong place
in a Hitchcock movie.</i>

1044
01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:44.770
<i>It always seems like
it's perfect for the composition,</i>

1045
01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:46.900
<i>perfect for the movement,</i>

1046
01:12:47.980 --> 01:12:51.400
<i>and is a flourish
without really drawing attention to itself.</i>

1047
01:12:52.030 --> 01:12:55.120
<font color="#dcdcdc">Hello, Loomis. This is Arbogast.
Is Lila there?</font>

1048
01:12:55.530 --> 01:12:57.700
<font color="#dcdcdc">Okay. Let me talk to her, please.</font>

1049
01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:00.500
<font color="#dcdcdc">Hello, Lila.</font>

1050
01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:03.960
<font color="#dcdcdc">Lila, listen. Marion was up here.</font>

1051
01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:07.630
<font color="#dcdcdc">Yes, she spent last Saturday night
at the Bates Motel.</font>

1052
01:13:07.710 --> 01:13:09.510
<font color="#dcdcdc">It's right out here on the old highway.</font>

1053
01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:13.050
<font color="#dcdcdc">I even know what cabin she was in.
It was number one.</font>

1054
01:13:13.550 --> 01:13:17.890
<font color="#dcdcdc">Well, this young fella that runs the place
said that she just spent the night,</font>

1055
01:13:17.970 --> 01:13:20.430
<font color="#dcdcdc">left the next day and that was it.</font>

1056
01:13:21.730 --> 01:13:25.900
<i>Martin Balsam also diverged from the script
quite a good deal,</i>

1057
01:13:26.650 --> 01:13:30.150
<i>but it didn't matter
because he breathes the character,</i>

1058
01:13:30.230 --> 01:13:33.780
<i>he wears the hat well,
he wears the world-weariness well,</i>

1059
01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:36.740
<i>and his kind of dogged persistence</i>

1060
01:13:36.820 --> 01:13:42.870
<i>in the face of Norman Bates'
sort of insistent charm</i>

1061
01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:49.670
<i>and boyish charm and manipulative charm
is really a perfect counterpoint.</i>

1062
01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:55.010
<font color="#dcdcdc">No, you stay there with Loomis.
I'll be back in about an hour.</font>

1063
01:13:55.090 --> 01:13:57.180
<font color="#dcdcdc">All right, fine. Listen, I...</font>

1064
01:13:57.260 --> 01:13:59.760
<font color="#dcdcdc">You'll be happy to know what I think.</font>

1065
01:13:59.850 --> 01:14:03.850
<font color="#dcdcdc">I think our friend Sam Loomis
didn't know that Marion was here.</font>

1066
01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:08.690
<font color="#dcdcdc">Yeah. All right.
See you in about an hour or less.</font>

1067
01:14:08.770 --> 01:14:09.820
<font color="#dcdcdc">All right, bye-bye.</font>

1068
01:14:59.370 --> 01:15:03.330
<i>Once again, always mindful of the audience.</i>

1069
01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:09.580
<i>The audience would say, "Well, he needs
to check for that snoopy motel owner."</i>

1070
01:15:09.670 --> 01:15:15.010
<i>And, of course, that's what he does.
But at the same time, he gives subtext.</i>

1071
01:15:17.090 --> 01:15:21.970
<i>This character hasn't seen
Norman's taxidermy collection.</i>

1072
01:15:22.050 --> 01:15:27.890
<i>Taxidermy, again, being a very shocking and
surprising thing to be in a movie in 1960.</i>

1073
01:15:28.770 --> 01:15:34.110
<i>It wasn't talked about.
It just seemed too odd and bizarre.</i>

1074
01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:41.240
<i>Again, it's part of the rich meal
that this film presents to the audience.</i>

1075
01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:44.580
<i>It's a strange meal and the elements
don't always go together,</i>

1076
01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:46.330
<i>and that's what makes it so interesting.</i>

1077
01:15:46.410 --> 01:15:48.870
<i>We see that Mother is now missing.</i>

1078
01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.090
<i>One might well,
in the second or third or fourth viewing,</i>

1079
01:15:53.170 --> 01:15:56.340
<i>wonder how she could have been
in the window and then gone,</i>

1080
01:15:56.420 --> 01:15:59.130
<i>but we won't worry about that for right now.</i>

1081
01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:06.970
<i>The house is still standing
on the Universal lot</i>

1082
01:16:07.730 --> 01:16:11.400
<i>and draws many, many tourists
year after year.</i>

1083
01:16:19.530 --> 01:16:22.320
<i>Beautifully shot, again, very creepy.</i>

1084
01:16:24.030 --> 01:16:28.330
<i>This sequence was fairly controversial</i>

1085
01:16:28.410 --> 01:16:31.120
<i>because Hitchcock had the flu,</i>

1086
01:16:31.210 --> 01:16:33.790
<i>and although he had storyboarded it
with Saul Bass,</i>

1087
01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:36.210
<i>who did a beautiful job on this,</i>

1088
01:16:37.550 --> 01:16:39.880
<i>he got the flu and couldn't go in to work.</i>

1089
01:16:39.970 --> 01:16:45.810
<i>And so he had his assistant director shoot
the sequence really using the storyboards.</i>

1090
01:16:46.430 --> 01:16:51.100
<i>It was Saul Bass' notion
that there would be shots</i>

1091
01:16:51.850 --> 01:16:54.770
<i>of the detective's hand grazing the banister,</i>

1092
01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:58.030
<i>because when he gets to the top</i>

1093
01:16:58.110 --> 01:17:02.530
<i>and he tries to grab
onto some kind of footing,</i>

1094
01:17:02.610 --> 01:17:07.030
<i>he rips the entire staircase
banister to banister.</i>

1095
01:17:07.660 --> 01:17:09.750
<i>And Saul Bass thought
that would be a good visual.</i>

1096
01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:14.420
<i>Hitchcock saw the footage
when he recovered from the flu,</i>

1097
01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:17.290
<i>said, "Absolutely wrong point of view.</i>

1098
01:17:17.380 --> 01:17:19.800
<i>"The man has to arrive
in complete innocence.</i>

1099
01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:23.010
<i>"He's snooping.
He doesn't expect this to happen</i>

1100
01:17:23.470 --> 01:17:24.970
<i>"and neither does the audience."</i>

1101
01:17:30.390 --> 01:17:33.270
<i>This was done with a gimbal.</i>

1102
01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:37.650
<i>Martin Balsam sat in a chair,
with rear projection.</i>

1103
01:17:37.730 --> 01:17:41.440
<i>That's the way Hitchcock loved to do it
in</i> Saboteur <i>and</i> North by Northwest

1104
01:17:41.530 --> 01:17:43.320
<i>and many of his films.</i>

1105
01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:45.450
<i>He loved the idea of free-floating,</i>

1106
01:17:45.530 --> 01:17:48.530
<i>and he didn't want it to look,
quote-unquote, realistic.</i>

1107
01:17:48.620 --> 01:17:51.910
<i>He wanted it to look stylised and bizarre.</i>

1108
01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:57.170
<font color="#dcdcdc">- It's been three.
- Well, are we just going to sit here and wait?</font>

1109
01:17:57.380 --> 01:18:02.010
<i>And here you have the Vera Miles character
who, by the way, is a very forthright,</i>

1110
01:18:02.090 --> 01:18:06.590
<i>assertive, independent,
let's-get-it-done character.</i>

1111
01:18:07.090 --> 01:18:12.560
<i>And I love that she is such a great
counterpoint with Gavin's character,</i>

1112
01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:14.890
<i>because he's sort of passive and slow.</i>

1113
01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:17.310
<font color="#dcdcdc">Patience doesn't run in my family, Sam.</font>

1114
01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:19.020
<font color="#dcdcdc">- I'm going out there.
- Look, Arbogast said...</font>

1115
01:18:19.110 --> 01:18:20.980
<font color="#dcdcdc">An hour, or less.</font>

1116
01:18:25.740 --> 01:18:28.870
<font color="#dcdcdc">- Well, I'm going.
- You'll never find it.</font>

1117
01:18:32.830 --> 01:18:35.160
<font color="#dcdcdc">- Stay here.
- Why can't I go with you?</font>

1118
01:18:35.250 --> 01:18:39.000
<font color="#dcdcdc">I don't know. One of us has to be here,
in case he's on the way.</font>

1119
01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:41.250
<font color="#dcdcdc">What am I supposed to do,
just sit here and wait?</font>

1120
01:18:41.340 --> 01:18:43.170
<font color="#dcdcdc">Yeah. Stay here.</font>

1121
01:18:43.300 --> 01:18:46.800
<i>I also love in this scene the sharp objects</i>

1122
01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:50.720
<i>and the moodiness of this
and the hair blowing.</i>

1123
01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:54.730
<i>It's a really good little example
of Hitchcock having a good time</i>

1124
01:18:54.810 --> 01:18:55.940
<i>and having a good laugh.</i>

1125
01:18:56.020 --> 01:19:00.360
<i>You have to remember that Hitchcock
saw this as a highly amusing movie</i>

1126
01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:03.480
<i>and had a ball making it.</i>

1127
01:19:03.570 --> 01:19:08.570
<i>He just thought it was a great deal of fun
even though it was a difficult movie for him</i>

1128
01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:12.240
<i>because Paramount,
where he'd been under contract,</i>

1129
01:19:12.330 --> 01:19:16.290
<i>a very lucrative, exclusive contract
all through the '50s,</i>

1130
01:19:16.370 --> 01:19:20.170
<i>they decided that
they didn't like this project whatsoever</i>

1131
01:19:20.540 --> 01:19:24.880
<i>and they didn't want any part of it,
and in fact, they made Hitchcock...</i>

1132
01:19:25.510 --> 01:19:30.430
<i>If he wanted to make it at all, he had
to put up the money for the film himself.</i>

1133
01:19:30.510 --> 01:19:34.770
<i>So, he kept the budget very low,
he used his television crew,</i>

1134
01:19:34.850 --> 01:19:38.310
<i>and he filmed it for about $800,000.</i>

1135
01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:42.480
<i>Another great moody scare-shot.</i>

1136
01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:45.190
<font color="#dcdcdc">- He didn't come back here?
- Sam!</font>

1137
01:19:45.610 --> 01:19:51.280
<i>What's great about all of this sequence
is that it's mostly exposition.</i>

1138
01:19:51.370 --> 01:19:55.370
<i>We're trying to find out
what's happened to the detective, Arbogast.</i>

1139
01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:58.790
<i>But the moodiness, the way it's shot,</i>

1140
01:19:58.870 --> 01:20:04.000
<i>the emphasis on sharp objects
that recall the knife in the shower sequence,</i>

1141
01:20:04.210 --> 01:20:06.300
<i>seeing the people in shadow,</i>

1142
01:20:06.380 --> 01:20:11.760
<i>it really carries
an extra freight and an extra mood</i>

1143
01:20:12.390 --> 01:20:14.970
<i>that Hitchcock was really expert at.</i>

1144
01:20:17.060 --> 01:20:20.850
<i>So, why don't they go to the authorities
more often in Hitchcock films?</i>

1145
01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:24.190
<i>Well, because going to the authorities
is pretty dull.</i>

1146
01:20:24.270 --> 01:20:28.150
<i>This sequence, though, is livened up
by good character actors.</i>

1147
01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:31.950
<i>We have John Mclntire,
who, just a few years after this,</i>

1148
01:20:32.030 --> 01:20:35.990
<i>would star in a very successful
television series,</i> Wagon Train.

1149
01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:41.920
<i>And Lurene Tuttle, who had a great career
as a voice on radio for many years,</i>

1150
01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.040
<i>and she always played
the old biddy in movies,</i>

1151
01:20:45.750 --> 01:20:48.090
<i>had a really great career in film.</i>

1152
01:20:48.170 --> 01:20:49.720
<font color="#dcdcdc">Norman took a wife?</font>

1153
01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:53.720
<i>Lurene, later in her life,
became a vocal coach</i>

1154
01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:56.970
<i>to many actors and many successful people.</i>

1155
01:20:57.560 --> 01:20:58.850
<i>And I got to know her.</i>

1156
01:20:58.930 --> 01:21:03.350
<i>And I always loved that her message
on her answering machine used to say,</i>

1157
01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:08.730
<i>"This is Lurene, please leave a message
and I will get back to you, oh, eventually."</i>

1158
01:21:09.190 --> 01:21:11.570
<i>And she had much better timing than I do,</i>

1159
01:21:11.650 --> 01:21:14.990
<i>but she was a really funny,
remarkable woman.</i>

1160
01:21:16.780 --> 01:21:22.870
<i>It's interesting, too, that John Mclntire,
who plays the local authority here,</i>

1161
01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:25.540
<i>was married to Jeanette Nolan.</i>

1162
01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:29.880
<i>Jeanette Nolan who, of course,
was Lady Macbeth</i>

1163
01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:34.590
<i>to Orson Welles in</i> Macbeth
<i>and had a long career in TV and film.</i>

1164
01:21:34.930 --> 01:21:38.560
<i>She also was one of the voices
of Mother in</i> Psycho.

1165
01:21:39.470 --> 01:21:43.390
<i>Again, various voices of different actresses</i>

1166
01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:50.150
<i>were melded together, edited together,
used in different sections of the film</i>

1167
01:21:50.530 --> 01:21:52.610
<i>to throw off the audience.</i>

1168
01:21:52.990 --> 01:21:57.910
<i>You have to remember that Hitchcock
had a notion that</i> Psycho,

1169
01:21:57.990 --> 01:22:03.580
<i>once audiences realised the big trick,
the big surprise at the ending,</i>

1170
01:22:03.660 --> 01:22:06.580
<i>that it would have a very short shelf life.</i>

1171
01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:09.380
<i>And, so, he wanted to make sure,</i>

1172
01:22:10.250 --> 01:22:13.760
<i>within the film, that he could play
as many tricks as he could</i>

1173
01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:18.220
<i>with varying the size of Mother,
varying the sound of Mother.</i>

1174
01:22:19.220 --> 01:22:22.270
<i>And here this scene
is really about exposition.</i>

1175
01:22:22.350 --> 01:22:26.520
<i>It's really about learning that Mother is dead,</i>

1176
01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:30.270
<i>that she's been dead
for many, many, many years,</i>

1177
01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:34.740
<i>and this baffles the characters
of Sam and Lila all the more</i>

1178
01:22:34.820 --> 01:22:40.200
<i>because Arbogast has, after all,
said he saw Mother in the window,</i>

1179
01:22:40.410 --> 01:22:42.870
<i>and so they're going to call Norman.</i>

1180
01:22:42.950 --> 01:22:45.410
<font color="#dcdcdc">You must remember that bad business
out there about 10 years ago.</font>

1181
01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:48.540
<i>Hitchcock is having a good time
in this scene.</i>

1182
01:22:50.090 --> 01:22:54.170
<i>He's really parodying kind of small-town life</i>

1183
01:22:55.260 --> 01:22:59.890
<i>with these small-town, very kind of laconic,</i>

1184
01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:02.600
<i>simple people.</i>

1185
01:23:02.970 --> 01:23:05.230
<i>And it's a good scene</i>

1186
01:23:05.310 --> 01:23:09.610
<i>because it injects a note of false normalcy</i>

1187
01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:15.820
<i>in a movie that is kind of a scale
of abnormality from beginning to end.</i>

1188
01:23:16.650 --> 01:23:19.240
<i>And, so, this sequence
is a good counterpoint</i>

1189
01:23:19.700 --> 01:23:23.910
<i>because it gives you an idea
of what life is like in Fairvale,</i>

1190
01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:29.370
<i>and it gives you, also, a chance
to understand</i>

1191
01:23:29.580 --> 01:23:33.750
<i>and to appreciate the fact that Hitchcock
always undermined authority.</i>

1192
01:23:34.050 --> 01:23:37.840
<i>He liked to make fun of police.
He liked to make fun of authority figures,</i>

1193
01:23:37.930 --> 01:23:41.090
<i>as he does later in</i> Psycho
<i>with a psychiatrist.</i>

1194
01:23:43.930 --> 01:23:46.640
<i>He liked to see them as people
who knew the facts</i>

1195
01:23:46.730 --> 01:23:49.100
<i>but never actually got the whole picture.</i>

1196
01:23:49.770 --> 01:23:53.820
<i>And that's what he's doing here,
as well as letting the audience in</i>

1197
01:23:53.900 --> 01:24:00.610
<i>on some information that is helping
to ground them in what's going on here.</i>

1198
01:24:03.450 --> 01:24:08.460
<i>But we can see that the Vera Miles character,
while the mystery is deepening</i>

1199
01:24:08.540 --> 01:24:13.380
<i>and while she is feeling more and more
concerned about her sister,</i>

1200
01:24:14.090 --> 01:24:18.720
<i>she is realising that the mystery
is deepening even further than she thought.</i>

1201
01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:21.720
<font color="#dcdcdc">Then took a helping
of the same stuff herself.</font>

1203

1205
01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:33.440
<font color="#dcdcdc">You mean that old woman I saw sitting in
the window out there wasn't Bates' mother?</font>

1206
01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:36.940
<i>Hitchcock sort of had a divided set
on this picture.</i>

1207
01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:42.450
<i>Perkins and Janet Leigh
would play word games with him,</i>

1208
01:24:42.530 --> 01:24:46.790
<i>mostly pornographic
but very erudite word games.</i>

1209
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:47.950
<i>He doted on them.</i>

1210
01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:51.080
<i>He thought they were charming
and funny and delightful.</i>

1211
01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:56.460
<i>He was far more difficult
with John Gavin and Vera Miles.</i>

1212
01:24:57.340 --> 01:25:00.380
<i>He just didn't have as much interest
in this part of the picture.</i>

1213
01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:03.720
<i>He thought it was very expository
and it troubled him.</i>

1214
01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:08.390
<i>He couldn't wait to cut back
to Norman Bates, as we're seeing now,</i>

1215
01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:13.980
<i>because that's where he felt
that the real interest and the real power</i>

1216
01:25:14.060 --> 01:25:17.650
<i>and the real darkness of this film resided.</i>

1217
01:25:23.860 --> 01:25:28.040
<i>The production design, the black and white
production design of this film,</i>

1218
01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:30.450
<i>was also nominated for an Oscar.</i>

1219
01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:35.880
<i>A very audacious shot.</i>

1220
01:25:37.290 --> 01:25:40.300
<i>Here's an actor at the height of his career</i>

1221
01:25:40.590 --> 01:25:43.680
<i>who is playing a very, very strange,
twisted role</i>

1222
01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:46.470
<i>and he lets his hips sway from side to side.</i>

1223
01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:49.310
<i>He's giving us a tip about the character,</i>

1224
01:25:49.390 --> 01:25:52.850
<i>but it's a very daring thing
from a career standpoint.</i>

1225
01:25:53.730 --> 01:25:58.570
<i>He actually asked,
Mr Perkins did of Hitchcock,</i>

1226
01:25:58.650 --> 01:26:01.650
<i>did he think this was going to be
a risky career move?</i>

1227
01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:06.110
<i>And Hitchcock said,
"It well might be, but why not try it."</i>

1228
01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:08.240
<i>He was in very good hands.</i>

1229
01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:10.830
<i>This sequence, once again,</i>

1230
01:26:10.910 --> 01:26:16.790
<i>a very daring, bravura, technical shot
with an aerial view.</i>

1231
01:26:17.580 --> 01:26:20.000
<i>It's really to divert the audience,</i>

1232
01:26:20.090 --> 01:26:26.050
<i>because they're interested in
why we're seeing this bizarre perspective</i>

1233
01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:32.770
<i>on the Bates house
as we've seen with the killing of Arbogast.</i>

1234
01:26:33.310 --> 01:26:35.810
<i>But it is also to disguise the fact</i>

1235
01:26:36.270 --> 01:26:41.650
<i>that Mrs Bates is really a figment
of Norman's imagination.</i>

1236
01:26:41.730 --> 01:26:48.280
<i>She's kept alive because of his strange,
twisted desire to keep her alive.</i>

1237
01:26:49.740 --> 01:26:53.290
<i>That little dummy that he's carrying,
what looks like a dummy,</i>

1238
01:26:53.370 --> 01:26:56.870
<i>was actually a little person,
an actress named Mitzi.</i>

1239
01:26:56.960 --> 01:27:00.340
<i>And, once again,
it was an attempt by Hitchcock</i>

1240
01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:05.220
<i>to vary the size of Mother
so that audiences could be confused.</i>

1241
01:27:06.010 --> 01:27:12.430
<i>This, once again, is a really good example
of Hitchcock having a good time</i>

1242
01:27:12.510 --> 01:27:15.680
<i>with the small-town life of Fairvale.</i>

1243
01:27:16.270 --> 01:27:20.110
<i>It's juxtaposing bizarre behaviour</i>

1244
01:27:20.190 --> 01:27:23.400
<i>and a bizarre story against church-going,</i>

1245
01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:27.860
<i>very right-minded people of the 1950s.</i>

1246
01:27:27.950 --> 01:27:31.740
<i>But really, what he's saying in all of this film
is that</i>

1247
01:27:32.490 --> 01:27:35.620
<i>we are all grey, we all have secrets.</i>

1248
01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:38.750
<i>There isn't any of us who is all good or evil.</i>

1249
01:27:38.830 --> 01:27:43.670
<i>Even good church-going folk
can harbour dark thoughts.</i>

1250
01:27:43.750 --> 01:27:47.670
<i>And that's really why this scene is staged
in this way.</i>

1251
01:27:49.010 --> 01:27:53.600
<i>But, once again, there is exposition,
there is information being put across.</i>

1252
01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:59.350
<i>But it's done in a kind of almost
Andy Griffith, small town kind of way,</i>

1253
01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:03.980
<i>which makes it all the more subversive
and dark and funny, if you ask me.</i>

1254
01:28:04.190 --> 01:28:08.030
<font color="#dcdcdc">- Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.
- No, you're not.</font>

1255
01:28:09.150 --> 01:28:10.700
<font color="#dcdcdc">Well, you want me to drop you
at the hotel or...</font>

1256
01:28:10.780 --> 01:28:11.820
<font color="#dcdcdc">Sam.</font>

1257
01:28:12.030 --> 01:28:14.450
<font color="#dcdcdc">I still won't feel satisfied until I go out there.</font>

1258
01:28:14.530 --> 01:28:17.410
<i>I like that Vera Miles' character
is so assertive.</i>

1259
01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:21.040
<i>It's one of the ways that</i> Psycho
<i>dates very well.</i>

1260
01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:24.750
<i>She's not the kind of character
who just will sit at home</i>

1261
01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:27.300
<i>and wait for John Gavin
to figure out the mystery.</i>

1262
01:28:27.380 --> 01:28:29.510
<i>It's her sister who has died.</i>

1263
01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:34.720
<i>She has a stake in this, and as a character,
she's very direct and forthright.</i>

1264
01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:39.390
<i>There's some dialogue cut from this scene
that we just saw in the car.</i>

1265
01:28:39.730 --> 01:28:46.480
<i>Joseph Stefano wanted to make an attempt
to give the characters of Sam and Lila</i>

1266
01:28:46.730 --> 01:28:53.160
<i>more stuff to do, more moments,
more feeling, more empathy.</i>

1267
01:28:53.450 --> 01:28:56.490
<i>And they talk in that scene that was cut,</i>

1268
01:28:56.580 --> 01:29:00.790
<i>it is in the script, though,
about the loss of Marion</i>

1269
01:29:00.870 --> 01:29:04.500
<i>and what it would mean
if she were, in fact, gone.</i>

1270
01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:09.800
<i>What if she has really stolen the money
and is long gone?</i>

1271
01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:12.550
<i>And, once again, Hitchcock cut it</i>

1272
01:29:12.630 --> 01:29:16.430
<i>because he felt that the audience
at this point wanted to know,</i>

1273
01:29:16.510 --> 01:29:19.720
<i>"What is the mystery? Who is Mother?</i>

1274
01:29:19.810 --> 01:29:21.230
<i>"When is she going to kill again?"</i>

1275
01:29:21.310 --> 01:29:24.270
<i>And they didn't want to know
about Sam and Lila,</i>

1276
01:29:24.350 --> 01:29:26.770
<i>so he kept cutting it back.</i>

1277
01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:30.280
<i>And the performances suffer for it,
or the characters suffer for it.</i>

1278
01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:33.820
<i>But because the actors are doing their best,</i>

1279
01:29:33.910 --> 01:29:37.910
<i>they still come across as more
than what Hitchcock called stick figures.</i>

1280
01:29:37.990 --> 01:29:42.160
<i>I like in this scene, too,
it's very, very carefully done</i>

1281
01:29:42.250 --> 01:29:46.290
<i>how Hitchcock has exploited
the physical resemblance</i>

1282
01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:49.130
<i>between Anthony Perkins and John Gavin.</i>

1283
01:29:50.630 --> 01:29:53.470
<i>It's a good, sly, wry commentary</i>

1284
01:29:53.550 --> 01:29:57.390
<i>on the fact that Norman
is the psychopath next door.</i>

1285
01:29:57.470 --> 01:29:59.220
<i>He looks just like us.</i>

1286
01:30:00.270 --> 01:30:04.140
<i>He's not a moustache-twirling,</i>

1287
01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:08.940
<i>eye-rolling, mask-wearing demon.</i>

1288
01:30:09.020 --> 01:30:13.030
<i>He's a guy just like us.
It would be simple to do it the other way.</i>

1289
01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:19.160
<i>In this film, psychosis, problems,
mental problems,</i>

1290
01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:22.000
<i>guilt, innocence,
they're all matters of degree.</i>

1291
01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:23.410
<i>No one is innocent in this movie,</i>

1292
01:30:23.500 --> 01:30:26.960
<i>as Hitchcock felt
no one is innocent in this world.</i>

1293
01:30:31.090 --> 01:30:32.840
<font color="#dcdcdc">I'll go on ahead.</font>

1294
01:30:38.470 --> 01:30:41.560
<font color="#dcdcdc">All right, there's your receipt.
Now, I'll show you the cabin.</font>

1295
01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:44.350
<font color="#dcdcdc">Don't bother yourself. We'll find it.</font>

1296
01:30:49.190 --> 01:30:52.110
<i>I love how Perkins
is constantly suspicious of these people.</i>

1297
01:30:52.190 --> 01:30:54.110
<i>He knows exactly when they're driving up</i>

1298
01:30:54.190 --> 01:30:57.200
<i>that they're not who
they're pretending to be,</i>

1299
01:30:57.820 --> 01:31:02.790
<i>because as a character pretending to be
other than what he is,</i>

1300
01:31:02.870 --> 01:31:09.000
<i>he's highly sensitive to anyone else
who is exerting any subterfuge</i>

1301
01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:11.750
<i>or pretending to be what they're not.</i>

1302
01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:13.250
<font color="#dcdcdc">I don't know.</font>

1303
01:31:13.460 --> 01:31:16.800
<i>Hitchcock was very, very careful
about production design.</i>

1304
01:31:16.880 --> 01:31:20.970
<i>He liked, especially in this film,
to emphasise</i>

1305
01:31:21.430 --> 01:31:23.810
<i>specific details within a room.</i>

1306
01:31:23.890 --> 01:31:25.730
<font color="#dcdcdc">How could we prove that...</font>

1307
01:31:25.890 --> 01:31:28.230
<i>All of this stuff was researched.</i>

1308
01:31:28.850 --> 01:31:34.820
<i>He had his associates go to motels,
take photographs,</i>

1309
01:31:34.900 --> 01:31:39.490
<i>look in the drawers of motels,
even photograph the furniture,</i>

1310
01:31:39.570 --> 01:31:44.540
<i>so that every detail could feel
like it was within the right universe.</i>

1311
01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:48.040
<i>Hitchcock didn't stay at places like this.</i>

1312
01:31:48.420 --> 01:31:53.040
<i>He found these people... He called them
perfectly ordinary bourgeois people,</i>

1313
01:31:53.420 --> 01:31:58.170
<i>but he was sort of intrigued and fascinated
by characters like this</i>

1314
01:31:58.260 --> 01:32:00.840
<i>because they seem so far from</i>

1315
01:32:01.260 --> 01:32:05.810
<i>his very lofty and sophisticated
way of living.</i>

1316
01:32:06.390 --> 01:32:11.480
<i>So, this was kind of an adventure for him
to do a film in this milieu,</i>

1317
01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:15.980
<i>which is, again, very much like
the 1955 film</i> Diaboliques.

1318
01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:22.200
<i>Downbeat, sort of dingy settings,
ordinary, everyday people</i>

1319
01:32:23.370 --> 01:32:27.450
<i>and an overall atmosphere of decay,</i>

1320
01:32:27.790 --> 01:32:31.120
<i>which I think you can see everywhere here,</i>

1321
01:32:31.460 --> 01:32:35.800
<i>even in the wood
and the seediness of the hotel.</i>

1322
01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:41.760
<i>The costumes, again,
were pretty much bought off the rack</i>

1323
01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:44.390
<i>because Hitchcock didn't want
any kind of couture</i>

1324
01:32:44.470 --> 01:32:49.060
<i>or anything that seemed too sophisticated</i>

1325
01:32:49.140 --> 01:32:55.070
<i>or not within the buying power
of the characters in the film.</i>

1326
01:32:58.740 --> 01:33:01.360
<i>So, they're doing some real sleuthing here,</i>

1327
01:33:01.450 --> 01:33:05.490
<i>trying to figure out
if they can get any glimpse of,</i>

1328
01:33:06.660 --> 01:33:10.620
<i>"Had Marion been in this particular cabin?"</i>

1329
01:33:12.460 --> 01:33:16.460
<i>And they kind of luck out
because, first time around,</i>

1330
01:33:17.300 --> 01:33:20.630
<i>they find an incriminating clue
in the bathroom.</i>

1331
01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:26.430
<i>One of Hitchcock's many overhead shots.
He loved the God's-eye point of view.</i>

1332
01:33:26.970 --> 01:33:30.980
<i>He loved to give a scene a kind of</i>

1333
01:33:32.190 --> 01:33:35.980
<i>skewed view to keep the audience</i>

1334
01:33:36.980 --> 01:33:40.190
<i>kind of at the edge of their seat
and off balance.</i>

1335
01:33:42.030 --> 01:33:45.990
<i>I've always found it
an unfortunate contrivance</i>

1336
01:33:46.070 --> 01:33:52.290
<i>that they would find the one piece of paper
that would say "$40, 000"</i>

1337
01:33:52.370 --> 01:33:55.460
<i>that would link it to Marion.</i>

1338
01:33:56.080 --> 01:33:58.800
<i>It seems like deus ex machina,</i>

1339
01:33:59.420 --> 01:34:02.050
<i>but in a film this good,
I think we can forgive it.</i>

1340
01:34:02.260 --> 01:34:05.300
<font color="#dcdcdc">You'll never be able to hold him still
if he doesn't want to be held.</font>

1341
01:34:05.390 --> 01:34:10.310
<font color="#dcdcdc">- I don't like you going into that house alone.
- I can handle a sick old woman.</font>

1342
01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:13.940
<font color="#dcdcdc">All right, I'll find Bates
and keep him occupied.</font>

1343
01:34:14.350 --> 01:34:15.600
<font color="#dcdcdc">Wait a minute.</font>

1344
01:34:15.690 --> 01:34:20.070
<i>Hitchcock used to talk about this film
as kind of a carnival thrill ride.</i>

1345
01:34:20.150 --> 01:34:24.570
<i>It was almost as if he were leading
the audience through a haunted house.</i>

1346
01:34:27.450 --> 01:34:33.410
<i>It is a thrill ride in that
it's a funhouse filled with twisted mirrors</i>

1347
01:34:33.710 --> 01:34:37.710
<i>and things jumping out at you
that really scare the hell out of people.</i>

1348
01:34:38.290 --> 01:34:43.550
<i>As I've gotten older, I've realised
that there is horror and deep truth</i>

1349
01:34:43.630 --> 01:34:47.340
<i>in those funhouse mirrors
if one looks deeply enough in them.</i>

1350
01:34:47.430 --> 01:34:51.510
<i>But it's very, very true that Hitchcock,</i>

1351
01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:55.480
<i>in the way he presented this movie
and the way he directed this movie,</i>

1352
01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:58.900
<i>was really way out of his league,</i>

1353
01:34:58.980 --> 01:35:02.190
<i>doing things
that he'd never really done before.</i>

1354
01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:07.360
<i>Very much doing something
in the old-dark-house genre</i>

1355
01:35:07.610 --> 01:35:12.040
<i>but putting a modern twist on that
for modern audiences.</i>

1356
01:35:15.460 --> 01:35:18.630
<i>It's the first time we've seen
the</i> Psycho <i>house in broad daylight.</i>

1357
01:35:18.710 --> 01:35:22.800
<i>And notice how we're intensified</i>

1358
01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:26.010
<i>in terms of our point of view
by the subjective tracking shots.</i>

1359
01:35:26.090 --> 01:35:31.180
<i>We're seeing the house as she is seeing it,
climbing those stairs.</i>

1360
01:35:36.180 --> 01:35:38.900
<i>By this point, by the way, in 1960,</i>

1361
01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:43.730
<i>movie audiences watching</i> Psycho
<i>were beside themselves.</i>

1362
01:35:43.820 --> 01:35:49.910
<i>They were talking out loud, screaming,
yelling to her, "Don't go in the house!"</i>

1363
01:35:50.530 --> 01:35:53.120
<i>It had the effect of kind of</i>

1364
01:35:53.790 --> 01:35:57.830
<i>a massive, huge,
spontaneous communal experience.</i>

1365
01:35:59.330 --> 01:36:01.580
<i>Of course, we all wanted her
to go in the house,</i>

1366
01:36:01.670 --> 01:36:04.550
<i>but at the same time, we were dreading it.</i>

1367
01:36:05.260 --> 01:36:10.300
<i>Hitchcock was very, very specific here
with the production design.</i>

1368
01:36:10.390 --> 01:36:15.270
<i>He wanted that sort of dark,
demented cupid at the side of the stairs</i>

1369
01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:17.100
<i>and other elements.</i>

1370
01:36:17.810 --> 01:36:20.350
<font color="#dcdcdc">I've been doing all the talking so far,
haven't I?</font>

1371
01:36:20.850 --> 01:36:24.770
<i>Here, again,
he's exploiting the physical resemblance</i>

1372
01:36:24.860 --> 01:36:27.940
<i>between Perkins and Gavin,</i>

1373
01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:31.530
<i>showing them in kind of half face,</i>

1374
01:36:33.490 --> 01:36:35.200
<i>showing them in a single shot.</i>

1375
01:36:35.370 --> 01:36:36.910
<font color="#dcdcdc">Just an expression.</font>

1376
01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:40.460
<font color="#dcdcdc">What I meant was
I'd do just about anything to get away.</font>

1377
01:36:40.540 --> 01:36:42.330
<font color="#dcdcdc">- Wouldn't you?
- No.</font>

1378
01:36:48.460 --> 01:36:49.880
<font color="#dcdcdc">Mrs Bates?</font>

1379
01:36:54.180 --> 01:36:56.810
<i>Vera Miles here
is the surrogate figure for us.</i>

1380
01:36:56.890 --> 01:37:01.100
<i>She is exploring the house the way
we would like to, but don't dare to.</i>

1381
01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:05.900
<i>Wonderful production design here.
You can almost smell this room.</i>

1382
01:37:07.570 --> 01:37:09.530
<i>The Victorian furniture.</i>

1383
01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:14.030
<i>Look at that statue.</i>

1384
01:37:14.950 --> 01:37:16.200
<i>Everything is overwrought.</i>

1385
01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:20.080
<i>Everything is highly feminine
and of another era.</i>

1386
01:37:25.630 --> 01:37:28.340
<i>People screamed
when she opened that wardrobe.</i>

1387
01:37:28.420 --> 01:37:30.170
<i>They were afraid
something was going to jump out.</i>

1388
01:37:30.260 --> 01:37:32.590
<i>These antiquated old dresses.</i>

1389
01:37:33.010 --> 01:37:37.560
<i>You can almost smell liniment and lavender
in this room.</i>

1390
01:37:41.100 --> 01:37:46.900
<i>A great touch here.
Very specific prop chosen by Hitchcock.</i>

1391
01:37:46.980 --> 01:37:52.450
<i>Once again, playing with the idea of mirrors,
multiple personalities, identities</i>

1392
01:37:52.650 --> 01:37:55.490
<i>and giving us a good scare
while he's doing it.</i>

1393
01:37:55.570 --> 01:37:58.870
<i>Very strange, sad shot</i>

1394
01:37:58.950 --> 01:38:02.660
<i>and a bit of production design here</i>

1395
01:38:02.750 --> 01:38:06.330
<i>with the shape of the body
worn into the mattress.</i>

1396
01:38:06.670 --> 01:38:09.250
<font color="#dcdcdc">I'm not saying
you shouldn't be contented here,</font>

1397
01:38:09.340 --> 01:38:10.590
<font color="#dcdcdc">I'm just doubting that you are.</font>

1398
01:38:10.670 --> 01:38:15.050
<i>Many lines were forced to be cut</i>

1399
01:38:15.130 --> 01:38:19.680
<i>from the picture and the script
by the censors,</i>

1400
01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:23.270
<i>specifically dealing with
mentions of Norman</i>

1401
01:38:23.350 --> 01:38:25.690
<i>and his relationship with his mother</i>

1402
01:38:26.060 --> 01:38:30.230
<i>and the sense
that they were more than happy,</i>

1403
01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:33.950
<i>that they were, in fact,
more than mother and son.</i>

1404
01:38:35.030 --> 01:38:36.660
<i>Those had to go.</i>

1405
01:38:37.530 --> 01:38:41.450
<i>1960 couldn't take that.
But we still get that same atmosphere.</i>

1406
01:38:41.540 --> 01:38:44.080
<i>This is a marvellous sequence</i>

1407
01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:49.420
<i>because we see a room
that's a perfect analogue for Norman,</i>

1408
01:38:49.500 --> 01:38:54.590
<i>half suspended between child and man.</i>

1409
01:38:58.180 --> 01:38:59.760
<i>We follow with her.</i>

1410
01:38:59.850 --> 01:39:03.520
<i>We see something he listens to,
Beethoven's</i> Eroica.

1411
01:39:04.730 --> 01:39:06.890
<i>We don't know
whether he has a Napoleonic complex,</i>

1412
01:39:06.980 --> 01:39:09.190
<i>but there it is all the same.</i>

1413
01:39:09.860 --> 01:39:14.030
<i>This was very, very important to Hitchcock,
this particular moment.</i>

1414
01:39:14.820 --> 01:39:16.450
<i>She finds a book.</i>

1415
01:39:16.740 --> 01:39:21.450
<i>In Victorian days,
books like this were usually pornography.</i>

1416
01:39:21.700 --> 01:39:23.450
<i>Watch her reaction.</i>

1417
01:39:24.290 --> 01:39:26.330
<i>We don't need to see what's on the page</i>

1418
01:39:26.410 --> 01:39:28.620
<i>to know that she saw something
deeply disturbing.</i>

1419
01:39:28.710 --> 01:39:34.710
<i>In the Bloch novel, that moment,
she does see something pornographic.</i>

1420
01:39:35.380 --> 01:39:38.380
<i>But here, it's left to the imagination,</i>

1421
01:39:39.180 --> 01:39:42.470
<i>and that's one of the great strengths
of Hitchcock, and particularly of this picture,</i>

1422
01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:46.480
<i>that although it is very direct
and blatant in certain ways,</i>

1423
01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:51.900
<i>Hitchcock really involved the audience
and he made the audience an accomplice.</i>

1424
01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:54.530
<i>So, we fill in the blanks,</i>

1425
01:39:54.610 --> 01:39:59.530
<i>and we sometimes fill in the blanks
in ways that are darker and scarier</i>

1426
01:39:59.610 --> 01:40:02.950
<i>and far more terrifying than anything
he could have spelled out for us.</i>

1427
01:40:03.030 --> 01:40:04.200
<font color="#dcdcdc">Where is she?</font>

1428
01:40:09.830 --> 01:40:11.920
<i>Hitchcock, when he would do violence,</i>

1429
01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:16.260
<i>would often bring the camera
very, very close and make it very simple,</i>

1430
01:40:17.260 --> 01:40:20.430
<i>like hitting Sam on the head as he does.</i>

1431
01:40:23.300 --> 01:40:25.350
<i>Back in 1960, by this point,</i>

1432
01:40:25.430 --> 01:40:29.270
<i>the audience was,
I would have to say, hysterical.</i>

1433
01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:35.650
<i>Once again, screaming, talking out loud.</i>

1434
01:40:36.940 --> 01:40:40.070
<i>The woman behind me
actually grabbed the back of my shirt,</i>

1435
01:40:40.150 --> 01:40:42.370
<i>I remember, really dramatically.</i>

1436
01:40:48.750 --> 01:40:54.130
<i>And, so, the music goes down in tone</i>

1437
01:40:54.590 --> 01:40:57.420
<i>as Vera Miles, as the character
is going into the basement.</i>

1438
01:40:57.510 --> 01:41:00.800
<i>The basement here is the psyche,</i>

1439
01:41:01.340 --> 01:41:04.970
<i>the dark underneath, the subconscious.</i>

1440
01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:10.140
<font color="#dcdcdc">Mrs Bates...</font>

1441
01:41:30.330 --> 01:41:32.040
<font color="#dcdcdc">I'm Norma Bates!</font>

1442
01:41:32.670 --> 01:41:36.290
<i>A hugely daring thing
for Anthony Perkins to do,</i>

1443
01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:38.920
<i>to actually appear in drag.</i>

1444
01:41:39.210 --> 01:41:44.840
<i>And many of you astute people will hear him
scream, "I am Norma Bates!"</i>

1445
01:41:45.340 --> 01:41:50.430
<i>Something that I can assure you,
you could not hear in the theatres in 1960,</i>

1446
01:41:50.520 --> 01:41:54.060
<i>because people were screaming
at the top of their lungs.</i>

1447
01:41:56.310 --> 01:41:59.530
<i>This sequence was going to be
very, very different as Hitchcock planned it.</i>

1448
01:41:59.610 --> 01:42:03.070
<i>It was going to be a very long tracking shot
and a relay</i>

1449
01:42:03.150 --> 01:42:07.410
<i>between first a newspaperman, a reporter</i>

1450
01:42:07.700 --> 01:42:14.000
<i>and then a young guy carrying in coffee
to the people in the room.</i>

1451
01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:16.630
<i>And then a pan of the psychiatrist</i>

1452
01:42:16.710 --> 01:42:20.170
<i>as he was moving down the corridor
to enter the room.</i>

1453
01:42:21.130 --> 01:42:22.380
<i>That was all simplified.</i>

1454
01:42:22.470 --> 01:42:26.430
<i>Again, Hitchcock felt that audiences
wanted to know exactly what was going on,</i>

1455
01:42:26.510 --> 01:42:32.430
<i>and here was the scene that Hitchcock
thought saved his picture from the censors.</i>

1456
01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:37.690
<i>We sometimes now, hearing this scene,
think it's overly didactic.</i>

1457
01:42:39.150 --> 01:42:41.860
<i>We don't need to know all this information.</i>

1458
01:42:41.940 --> 01:42:46.910
<i>He's explaining, of course, the dynamic
between Norman and his mother,</i>

1459
01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:51.120
<i>and how Marion factored into all of that.</i>

1460
01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:56.000
<i>It seems long and it seems lugubrious to us,</i>

1461
01:42:56.080 --> 01:43:00.500
<i>but in fact, in 1960,
Hitchcock felt that the movie</i>

1462
01:43:00.590 --> 01:43:04.590
<i>would never have gotten past the censors
without this scene.</i>

1463
01:43:05.010 --> 01:43:09.680
<i>He hired Simon Oakland,
again, a very, very good character actor,</i>

1464
01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:15.060
<i>to do this very, very long scene.
I think it's two or three pages in the script.</i>

1465
01:43:15.140 --> 01:43:20.230
<i>It really lays out for us
exactly what happened,</i>

1466
01:43:20.310 --> 01:43:25.740
<i>because in 1960,
this plot revelation and a plot like this</i>

1467
01:43:26.490 --> 01:43:30.410
<i>was really a mind bender for the audience,</i>

1468
01:43:30.490 --> 01:43:33.950
<i>and many people needed to know.</i>

1469
01:43:34.580 --> 01:43:37.670
<i>They needed to be brought
to some semblance of reality</i>

1470
01:43:37.750 --> 01:43:41.590
<i>and some matter-of-factness,
what they had just witnessed.</i>

1471
01:43:41.670 --> 01:43:46.090
<i>What was the dynamic
between Norman and his mother?</i>

1472
01:43:46.170 --> 01:43:50.300
<i>Why did Anthony Perkins
come hurdling around the corner</i>

1473
01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:52.300
<i>dressed in his mother's clothes?</i>

1474
01:43:52.390 --> 01:43:56.180
<i>Well, we all know the secret of</i> Psycho <i>now,
and we can all be glib about this</i>

1475
01:43:56.270 --> 01:44:00.150
<i>and say that it's too talky and too wordy,</i>

1476
01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:03.650
<i>and that criticism is well taken,</i>

1477
01:44:04.150 --> 01:44:08.280
<i>but it's a very typically
Hitchcockian scene, really,</i>

1478
01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:13.030
<i>because it's once again the authority figure
who knows all the facts,</i>

1479
01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:15.450
<i>who can explain all of this
in black and white,</i>

1480
01:44:15.540 --> 01:44:17.960
<i>but yet, really doesn't get it deep down.</i>

1481
01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:23.460
<i>Doesn't really get how deeply,
deeply disturbing this movie has been,</i>

1482
01:44:24.670 --> 01:44:28.170
<i>and how dark and deep
the psyche of Norman is.</i>

1483
01:44:29.180 --> 01:44:33.600
<i>The other characters, the officials,
we don't even need to know who they are.</i>

1484
01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:37.310
<i>They're police, they're county officials,
they're whomever.</i>

1485
01:44:37.390 --> 01:44:40.440
<i>They're what Hitchcock called
the grey people, the plausibles,</i>

1486
01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:44.270
<i>the people who need explanations.</i>

1487
01:44:44.860 --> 01:44:46.480
<font color="#dcdcdc">...but she was a corpse.</font>

1488
01:44:48.530 --> 01:44:51.280
<font color="#dcdcdc">So he began to think and speak for her,</font>

1489
01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:53.950
<font color="#dcdcdc">give her half his life, so to speak.</font>

1490
01:44:55.660 --> 01:45:00.830
<i>The sequence that we're seeing, by the way,
this scene was done in one take.</i>

1491
01:45:00.920 --> 01:45:06.630
<i>This actor, Simon Oakland,
got all of his dialogue out rather beautifully,</i>

1492
01:45:06.710 --> 01:45:09.340
<i>if you listen to it, in one single take.</i>

1493
01:45:09.420 --> 01:45:14.550
<i>Once again, the crew broke into applause
when he finished it.</i>

1494
01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:18.930
<i>And Hitchcock, who rarely got up
from his director's chair,</i>

1495
01:45:19.890 --> 01:45:24.770
<i>got up, crossed the stage,
shook Mr Oakland's hand</i>

1496
01:45:24.860 --> 01:45:28.360
<i>and said, "Mr Oakland,
you have just saved my picture."</i>

1497
01:45:28.690 --> 01:45:31.280
<i>And once again, what he meant by that was,</i>

1498
01:45:31.570 --> 01:45:34.910
<i>"You have just saved this picture
from the censors."</i>

1499
01:45:35.370 --> 01:45:40.910
<i>In these days, in 1960, the censors
really could make or break a film.</i>

1500
01:45:42.500 --> 01:45:45.210
Psycho <i>was a really very dangerous game.</i>

1501
01:45:45.290 --> 01:45:50.340
<i>And through it, no one was ever sure
whether they were gonna make it,</i>

1502
01:45:50.420 --> 01:45:54.340
<i>whether they were going to pass
the censors' stringent tests</i>

1503
01:45:54.430 --> 01:45:59.930
<i>for feasibility and appropriateness</i>

1504
01:46:00.020 --> 01:46:02.020
<i>for this to be shown to audiences.</i>

1505
01:46:02.100 --> 01:46:04.480
<i>In fact, Hitchcock was so worried</i>

1506
01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:08.400
<i>about whether or not</i> Psycho
<i>could be shown in theatres.</i>

1507
01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:10.940
<i>First of all,
he wasn't sure whether it was good enough,</i>

1508
01:46:11.030 --> 01:46:13.400
<i>and two, whether the censors would pass it,</i>

1509
01:46:13.490 --> 01:46:16.870
<i>that he actually thought
of breaking it into two parts</i>

1510
01:46:16.950 --> 01:46:21.000
<i>and showing it on television
as part of his TV show.</i>

1511
01:46:21.540 --> 01:46:25.580
<i>The first part would've ended with the death
of Marion in the shower,</i>

1512
01:46:25.670 --> 01:46:31.300
<i>and the second part would've taken up
Sam and Lila investigating the crime</i>

1513
01:46:31.800 --> 01:46:36.680
<i>and the murder with Arbogast
leading to what we're seeing now.</i>

1514
01:46:37.390 --> 01:46:42.930
<i>But Hitchcock, in editing the film,</i>

1515
01:46:43.020 --> 01:46:48.980
<i>really realised that he had something
on his hands that was special and unique.</i>

1516
01:46:49.940 --> 01:46:54.700
<i>The first audiences to see this picture
were really only the cast and crew members,</i>

1517
01:46:55.030 --> 01:46:57.280
<i>and they hadn't seen
the picture cut together.</i>

1518
01:46:57.360 --> 01:47:01.160
<i>And the reactions were exactly like
those of audiences in theatres.</i>

1519
01:47:01.240 --> 01:47:02.700
<i>They screamed,</i>

1520
01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:06.170
<i>they jumped out of their seats,
they grabbed each other.</i>

1521
01:47:06.250 --> 01:47:08.460
<i>And Hitchcock shrugged.</i>

1522
01:47:08.540 --> 01:47:12.340
<i>He honestly couldn't understand
what was going on.</i>

1523
01:47:12.550 --> 01:47:14.420
<font color="#dcdcdc">- Oh, sure.
- All right.</font>

1524
01:47:20.350 --> 01:47:23.270
<i>This sequence, though,
completely undoes the last one</i>

1525
01:47:23.350 --> 01:47:26.770
<i>because it is dark and strange</i>

1526
01:47:26.850 --> 01:47:31.020
<i>and takes us straight into the psyche
of Norman Bates.</i>

1527
01:47:35.860 --> 01:47:39.070
<i>It's sad when a mother
has to speak the words</i>

1528
01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:41.160
<i>that condemn her own son,</i>

1529
01:47:41.240 --> 01:47:45.080
<i>but I couldn't allow them to believe
that I would commit murder.</i>

1530
01:47:45.160 --> 01:47:49.000
<i>They'll put him away now,
as I should have years ago.</i>

1531
01:47:49.380 --> 01:47:53.710
<i>What happens here in terms of shooting this</i>

1532
01:47:55.670 --> 01:48:00.220
<i>is an entirely closed set,
really a camera on an actor,</i>

1533
01:48:00.890 --> 01:48:04.890
<i>and many, many people on the set
holding their breath.</i>

1534
01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:10.150
<i>Everyone I talked to in doing the book</i>
Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho

1535
01:48:10.850 --> 01:48:15.940
<i>said that it was absolutely eerie
to be in a room with Anthony Perkins</i>

1536
01:48:16.030 --> 01:48:18.990
<i>because he was so invested in the character.</i>

1537
01:48:19.070 --> 01:48:23.910
<i>He was so convincing.
He was so real as Norman.</i>

1538
01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:26.540
<i>I'm not even gonna swat that fly.</i>

1539
01:48:26.620 --> 01:48:29.370
<i>I hope they are watching. They'll see.</i>

1540
01:48:30.290 --> 01:48:35.630
<i>And here we begin to see the smile
that Janet Leigh gave earlier in the film.</i>

1541
01:48:36.460 --> 01:48:38.340
<i>And we see a skull.</i>

1542
01:48:38.420 --> 01:48:40.760
<i>That appeared on some prints
and not on others.</i>

1543
01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:43.180
<i>Hitchcock thought he had gone too far,</i>

1544
01:48:43.260 --> 01:48:48.270
<i>but with</i> Psycho, <i>he had created a movie
that succeeded because it went too far.</i>
