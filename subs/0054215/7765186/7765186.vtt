1
00:03:16.346 --> 00:03:18.598
You never did eat
your lunch, did you?

2
00:03:18.681 --> 00:03:20.433
I better get back to the office.

3
00:03:20.517 --> 00:03:23.603
These extended lunch hours
give my boss excess acid.

4
00:03:23.686 --> 00:03:25.063
Why don't you call
your boss and tell him

5
00:03:25.063 --> 00:03:27.482
you're taking the rest
of the afternoon off?

6
00:03:27.565 --> 00:03:29.818
Friday anyway, and hot.

7
00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.072
What do I do with my free afternoon?
Walk you to the airport?

8
00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.492
Well, we could laze around
here a while longer.

9
00:03:38.827 --> 00:03:41.121
Checking-out time is 3:00 p.m.

10
00:03:41.746 --> 00:03:45.667
Hotels of this sort aren't
interested in you when you come in,

11
00:03:45.792 --> 00:03:47.836
but when your time is up...

12
00:03:47.836 --> 00:03:50.422
Oh, Sam, I hate having to be
with you in a place like this.

13
00:03:50.505 --> 00:03:52.257
I've heard of married couples
who deliberately spend

14
00:03:52.257 --> 00:03:54.134
an occasional night
in a cheap hotel.

15
00:03:54.217 --> 00:03:58.179
When you're married you can do
a lot of things deliberately.

16
00:03:58.263 --> 00:04:00.849
You sure talk like
a girl who's been married.

17
00:04:01.711 --> 00:04:03.969
Sam, this is the last time.

18
00:04:04.227 --> 00:04:05.353
- Yeah?
- For what?

19
00:04:06.124 --> 00:04:07.327
For this.

20
00:04:07.772 --> 00:04:10.859
For meeting you in secret
so we can be secretive.

21
00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:15.822
You come down here on business
trips, and we steal lunch hours.

22
00:04:16.823 --> 00:04:19.033
I wish you wouldn't even come.

23
00:04:19.826 --> 00:04:23.246
All right. What do we do instead?
Write each other lurid love letters?

24
00:04:23.329 --> 00:04:25.582
Oh, I have to go, Sam.

25
00:04:28.174 --> 00:04:29.502
I can come down next week.

26
00:04:29.961 --> 00:04:31.128
No.

27
00:04:31.502 --> 00:04:35.717
Not even just to see you?
Have lunch, in public?

28
00:04:36.843 --> 00:04:40.096
Oh, we can see each other.
We can even have dinner.

29
00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:42.765
But respectably.

30
00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:45.602
In my house, with my mother's
picture on the mantel

31
00:04:45.685 --> 00:04:48.980
and my sister helping me
broil a big steak for three.

32
00:04:49.606 --> 00:04:51.024
And after the steak,

33
00:04:51.107 --> 00:04:53.860
do we send sister to the movies,
turn Mama's picture to the wall?

34
00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:54.861
Sam!

35
00:04:57.989 --> 00:04:59.449
All right.

36
00:05:06.164 --> 00:05:09.124
Marion, whenever it's
possible, I want to see you.

37
00:05:09.501 --> 00:05:12.795
And under any circumstances,
even respectability.

38
00:05:13.755 --> 00:05:16.883
You make respectability
sound disrespectful.

39
00:05:16.966 --> 00:05:18.718
Oh, no, I'm all for it.

40
00:05:18.801 --> 00:05:22.222
It requires patience, temperance,
a lot of sweating out.

41
00:05:22.847 --> 00:05:25.642
Otherwise, though,
it's just hard work.

42
00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:31.272
But if I can see you and touch you,
even as simply as this, I won't mind.

43
00:05:33.858 --> 00:05:36.611
I'm tired of sweating for
people who aren't there.

44
00:05:36.694 --> 00:05:39.572
I sweat to pay off my father's
debts, and he's in his grave.

45
00:05:39.656 --> 00:05:40.865
I sweat to pay my
ex-wife alimony,

46
00:05:40.865 --> 00:05:44.661
and she's living on the other
side of the world somewhere.

47
00:05:46.371 --> 00:05:47.872
I pay, too.

48
00:05:49.082 --> 00:05:51.876
They also pay who
meet in hotel rooms.

49
00:05:53.002 --> 00:05:56.256
A couple of years and
my debts will be paid off.

50
00:05:56.881 --> 00:05:58.841
If she ever remarries,
the alimony stops.

51
00:05:59.128 --> 00:06:00.843
I haven't even been
married once yet.

52
00:06:01.034 --> 00:06:03.042
Yeah. But when you do,
you'll swing.

53
00:06:03.596 --> 00:06:05.765
Oh, Sam, let's get married.

54
00:06:10.603 --> 00:06:15.024
Yeah. And live with me in a storeroom
behind a hardware store in Fairvale?

55
00:06:15.483 --> 00:06:18.278
We'll have lots of laughs.
I'll tell you what.

56
00:06:18.361 --> 00:06:21.948
When I send my ex-wife her
alimony, you can lick the stamps.

57
00:06:22.031 --> 00:06:23.866
I'll lick the stamps.

58
00:06:32.917 --> 00:06:34.752
Marion, you want
to cut this off,

59
00:06:34.836 --> 00:06:37.171
go out and find yourself
somebody available?

60
00:06:37.255 --> 00:06:38.965
I'm thinking of it.

61
00:06:42.802 --> 00:06:45.763
How could you even
think a thing like that?

62
00:06:46.347 --> 00:06:47.628
Don't miss your plane.

63
00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:49.089
Hey, we can leave
together, can't we?

64
00:06:49.518 --> 00:06:52.270
I'm late and you have
to put your shoes on.

65
00:07:06.784 --> 00:07:08.494
Is Mr. Lowery back from lunch?

66
00:07:08.578 --> 00:07:10.997
He's lunching with the man who's
buying the Harris Street property.

67
00:07:10.997 --> 00:07:14.876
You know, the oil lease man. That's
why he's late. You got a headache?

68
00:07:14.959 --> 00:07:16.544
It'll pass.

69
00:07:16.628 --> 00:07:18.129
Headaches are like resolutions,

70
00:07:18.212 --> 00:07:20.173
you forget them as soon
as they stop hurting.

71
00:07:20.256 --> 00:07:23.384
Have you got some aspirin?
I've got something, not aspirin.

72
00:07:23.468 --> 00:07:26.095
My mother's doctor gave them
to me the day of my wedding.

73
00:07:26.179 --> 00:07:29.891
Teddy was furious when he found
out I'd taken tranquilizers.

74
00:07:30.683 --> 00:07:31.893
Any calls?

75
00:07:32.435 --> 00:07:36.356
Teddy called me. My mother
called to see if Teddy called.

76
00:07:36.439 --> 00:07:39.233
Oh, your sister called to say she's
going to Tucson to do some buying

77
00:07:39.317 --> 00:07:40.985
and she'll be gone the
whole weekend and...

78
00:07:46.616 --> 00:07:48.743
It's as hot as fresh milk.

79
00:07:49.494 --> 00:07:54.082
Hey, you girls ought to get your
boss to air condition you up.

80
00:07:54.165 --> 00:07:55.667
He can afford it today.

81
00:07:57.001 --> 00:07:59.212
Marion, will you get the copies of
that deed ready for Mr. Cassidy?

82
00:07:59.212 --> 00:08:00.338
Yes, sir.

83
00:08:00.421 --> 00:08:02.840
Tomorrow's the day,
my sweet little girl.

84
00:08:03.591 --> 00:08:06.344
Oh, not you. My daughter.

85
00:08:07.053 --> 00:08:08.471
A baby.

86
00:08:09.472 --> 00:08:14.185
And tomorrow she stands her sweet self
up there and gets married away from me.

87
00:08:15.311 --> 00:08:18.356
I want you to take
a look at my baby.

88
00:08:21.234 --> 00:08:23.111
Eighteen years old

89
00:08:23.653 --> 00:08:27.407
and she never had an unhappy
day in any one of those years.

90
00:08:28.157 --> 00:08:30.451
Come on, Tom. My office
is air conditioned.

91
00:08:30.535 --> 00:08:33.329
Do you know what I
do about unhappiness?

92
00:08:34.247 --> 00:08:35.832
I buy it off.

93
00:08:36.165 --> 00:08:38.209
Are... Are you unhappy?

94
00:08:39.836 --> 00:08:41.671
Not inordinately.

95
00:08:43.464 --> 00:08:46.843
I'm buying this house for
my baby's wedding present.

96
00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:50.346
$40,000 cash.

97
00:08:52.265 --> 00:08:57.437
Now that's not buying happiness.
That's just buying off unhappiness.

98
00:08:59.897 --> 00:09:03.025
I never carry more than
I can afford to lose.

99
00:09:03.893 --> 00:09:04.730
Count them!

100
00:09:04.755 --> 00:09:06.028
I declare!

101
00:09:06.112 --> 00:09:08.823
I don't. That's how
I get to keep it.

102
00:09:09.699 --> 00:09:13.786
Tom, a cash transaction of
this size is most irregular.

103
00:09:13.828 --> 00:09:16.831
So what? It's my private money.

104
00:09:16.873 --> 00:09:18.291
Now it's yours.

105
00:09:18.374 --> 00:09:19.709
Suppose we put it in the safe,

106
00:09:19.792 --> 00:09:23.212
and then Monday morning
when you're feeling good...

107
00:09:23.296 --> 00:09:25.548
Oh, speaking of feeling good,

108
00:09:25.631 --> 00:09:28.801
where's that bottle you
said was in your desk?

109
00:09:32.847 --> 00:09:37.018
You know, sometimes I
can keep my mouth shut.

110
00:09:42.148 --> 00:09:44.817
Lowery, I am dying
of thirst-aroonie.

111
00:09:48.988 --> 00:09:51.073
I don't even want it in
the office over the weekend.

112
00:09:51.157 --> 00:09:53.451
Put it in the safe deposit
box in the bank,

113
00:09:53.534 --> 00:09:55.703
and we'll get him to give us
a check on Monday instead.

114
00:09:55.745 --> 00:09:56.829
Yes.

115
00:10:02.335 --> 00:10:03.961
He was flirting with you.

116
00:10:04.045 --> 00:10:06.839
I guess he must've
noticed my wedding ring.

117
00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:21.854
Come in.

118
00:10:23.981 --> 00:10:26.275
The copies. Mr. Lowery,
if you don't mind,

119
00:10:26.359 --> 00:10:27.985
I'd like to go right
on home after the bank.

120
00:10:28.187 --> 00:10:30.321
- I have a slight...
- You go right on home.

121
00:10:30.404 --> 00:10:32.615
Because me and your
boss are going out

122
00:10:32.698 --> 00:10:35.117
and get ourselves a little
drinking done. Right?

123
00:10:35.638 --> 00:10:38.371
- Of course. Do you feel ill?
- Just a headache.

124
00:10:38.454 --> 00:10:42.834
What you need is a weekend in Las
Vegas, the playground of the world.

125
00:10:42.834 --> 00:10:45.498
I'm going to spend this weekend in bed.
Thank you.

126
00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:52.552
Aren't you going to take the pills?
They'll knock that headache out.

127
00:10:52.635 --> 00:10:54.887
Can't buy off
unhappiness with pills.

128
00:10:56.305 --> 00:11:00.893
I guess I'll go put this money in the
bank and then go home and sleep it off.

129
00:13:03.057 --> 00:13:06.394
<i>Marion, what in the world...
What are you doing up here?</i>

130
00:13:06.477 --> 00:13:08.885
<i>Of course I'm glad to see you.
I always am.</i>

131
00:13:09.397 --> 00:13:11.148
<i>What is it, Marion?</i>

132
00:14:50.414 --> 00:14:51.874
Hold it there.

133
00:14:57.922 --> 00:14:59.757
In quite a hurry.

134
00:15:00.049 --> 00:15:02.843
Yes. I didn't intend
to sleep so long.

135
00:15:02.968 --> 00:15:05.888
I almost had an accident
last night from sleepiness,

136
00:15:05.971 --> 00:15:07.635
so I decided to pull over.

137
00:15:08.224 --> 00:15:09.549
You slept here all night?

138
00:15:10.476 --> 00:15:13.479
Yes. As I said, I couldn't
keep my eyes open.

139
00:15:13.854 --> 00:15:17.191
There are plenty of motels in this area.
You should've...

140
00:15:17.274 --> 00:15:18.943
I mean, just to be safe.

141
00:15:19.026 --> 00:15:23.823
I didn't intend to sleep all night. I
just pulled over. Have I broken any laws?

142
00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:26.677
- No, ma'am.
- Then I'm free to go?

143
00:15:28.577 --> 00:15:30.329
Is anything wrong?

144
00:15:31.413 --> 00:15:34.669
Of course not. Am I acting as
if there's something wrong?

145
00:15:35.209 --> 00:15:36.388
Frankly, yes.

146
00:15:37.599 --> 00:15:38.838
Please, I'd like to go.

147
00:15:39.672 --> 00:15:40.857
Well, is there?

148
00:15:41.591 --> 00:15:42.505
Is there what?

149
00:15:45.219 --> 00:15:47.096
I've told you there's
nothing wrong,

150
00:15:47.179 --> 00:15:50.099
except that I'm in a hurry and
you're taking up my time.

151
00:15:50.353 --> 00:15:53.328
Now, just a moment.
Turn your motor off, please.

152
00:15:55.855 --> 00:15:57.214
May I see your license?

153
00:16:00.776 --> 00:16:01.777
Why?

154
00:16:02.186 --> 00:16:03.187
Please.

155
00:18:09.446 --> 00:18:10.836
Be with you in a second!

156
00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:17.431
- I'm in no mood for trouble.
- What?

157
00:19:17.876 --> 00:19:20.593
There's an old saying. "The first customer
of the day is always the most trouble."

158
00:19:20.618 --> 00:19:22.312
But like I say, I'm
in no mood for it,

159
00:19:22.337 --> 00:19:25.564
so I'm gonna treat you so fair and square
that you won't have one human reason...

160
00:19:25.647 --> 00:19:27.454
Can I trade my car
in and take another?

161
00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:31.945
Do anything you have a mind to. Being
a woman, you will. That yours?

162
00:19:32.298 --> 00:19:34.406
Yes, it's... There's
nothing wrong with it.

163
00:19:34.548 --> 00:19:36.454
- I just...
- Sick of the sight of it.

164
00:19:37.024 --> 00:19:38.202
Why don't you have
a look around here

165
00:19:38.202 --> 00:19:39.828
and see if there's something
that strikes your eyes.

166
00:19:39.828 --> 00:19:41.830
And meanwhile, I'll have my
mechanic give yours the once-over.

167
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:43.571
- You want some coffee? I was just about...
- No, thank you.

168
00:19:43.962 --> 00:19:46.210
I'm in a hurry and I just
wanna make a change.

169
00:19:46.293 --> 00:19:47.922
One thing people
never ought to be

170
00:19:47.947 --> 00:19:49.797
when they're buying used cars
and that's in a hurry.

171
00:19:49.986 --> 00:19:53.957
Like I said, it's too nice a day to argue.
I'll shoot your car in the garage here.

172
00:20:16.198 --> 00:20:18.200
That's the one I'd have
picked for you myself.

173
00:20:18.283 --> 00:20:19.493
- How much?
- Go ahead.

174
00:20:19.658 --> 00:20:21.954
- Spin it around the block.
- It looks fine.

175
00:20:22.283 --> 00:20:23.815
How much would it
be with my car?

176
00:20:24.299 --> 00:20:27.143
You mean you don't want the usual
day and a half to think it over?

177
00:20:28.533 --> 00:20:30.877
You are in a hurry, aren't you?
Somebody chasing you?

178
00:20:31.495 --> 00:20:33.231
Of course not. Please.

179
00:20:33.596 --> 00:20:37.635
Well, it's the first time the customer
ever high-pressured the salesman.

180
00:20:40.095 --> 00:20:41.764
I figure roughly

181
00:20:44.143 --> 00:20:46.190
your car plus $700.

182
00:20:47.237 --> 00:20:48.439
$700.

183
00:20:48.979 --> 00:20:50.816
You always got time to
argue money, huh?

184
00:20:51.815 --> 00:20:52.724
All right.

185
00:20:58.657 --> 00:21:00.826
I take it you can prove
that car is yours.

186
00:21:00.826 --> 00:21:03.787
I mean, out-of-state license and all.
You got your pink slip...

187
00:21:03.787 --> 00:21:07.453
I believe I have the necessary papers.
Is there a ladies' room?

188
00:21:07.884 --> 00:21:08.984
In the building.

189
00:21:20.679 --> 00:21:22.014
Over there.

190
00:22:18.946 --> 00:22:21.547
I think you better take
it for a trial spin.

191
00:22:21.821 --> 00:22:24.201
I don't want any bad word of
mouth about California Charlie.

192
00:22:24.547 --> 00:22:27.499
I'd really rather not. Can't
we just settle this and...

193
00:22:27.524 --> 00:22:29.831
I might as well be perfectly
honest with you, ma'am.

194
00:22:29.915 --> 00:22:31.735
It's not that I don't
trust you, but...

195
00:22:31.852 --> 00:22:32.852
But what?

196
00:22:33.102 --> 00:22:34.711
Is there anything
so terribly wrong

197
00:22:34.795 --> 00:22:37.196
about making a decision
and wanting to hurry?

198
00:22:38.024 --> 00:22:39.383
Do you think I've stolen my car?

199
00:22:39.758 --> 00:22:40.842
No, ma'am.

200
00:22:42.165 --> 00:22:43.813
All right, let's go inside.

201
00:23:21.518 --> 00:23:22.769
Hey!

202
00:23:29.808 --> 00:23:31.885
Just put it in here, please.

203
00:23:35.214 --> 00:23:36.398
Thank you.

204
00:23:45.633 --> 00:23:48.125
<i>Heck, Officer, that was the
first time I ever saw the customer</i>

205
00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:49.735
<i>high-pressure the salesman.</i>

206
00:23:50.352 --> 00:23:51.539
<i>Somebody chasing her?</i>

207
00:23:52.399 --> 00:23:54.344
<i>I better have a look
at those papers, Charlie.</i>

208
00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:56.877
<i>She look like a
wrong one to you?</i>

209
00:23:57.929 --> 00:23:59.085
<i>Acted like one.</i>

210
00:24:00.085 --> 00:24:03.000
<i>The only funny thing,
she paid me $700 in cash.</i>

211
00:24:13.046 --> 00:24:14.227
<i>Yes, Mr. Lowery.</i>

212
00:24:14.522 --> 00:24:16.686
<i>Caroline, Marion still isn't in?</i>

213
00:24:16.991 --> 00:24:20.163
<i>No, Mr. Lowery, but then she's always
a bit late on Monday mornings.</i>

214
00:24:20.718 --> 00:24:22.358
<i>Buzz me the minute she comes in.</i>

215
00:24:24.897 --> 00:24:27.210
<i>And call her sister. No one's
answering at the house.</i>

216
00:24:27.561 --> 00:24:29.710
<i>I called her sister,
Mr. Lowery, where she works,</i>

217
00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:31.828
<i>the Music Makers
Music Store, you know,</i>

218
00:24:32.147 --> 00:24:34.665
<i>and she doesn't know where
Marion is any more than we do.</i>

219
00:24:34.897 --> 00:24:36.007
<i>You better run out to the house.</i>

220
00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:38.502
<i>She may be, well,
unable to answer the phone.</i>

221
00:24:38.772 --> 00:24:41.523
<i>Her sister's going to do that.
She's as worried as we are.</i>

222
00:24:45.842 --> 00:24:47.609
<i>No, I haven't the faintest idea.</i>

223
00:24:48.047 --> 00:24:50.806
<i>As I said, I last saw your sister
when she left this office on Friday.</i>

224
00:24:51.094 --> 00:24:54.297
<i>She said she didn't feel well and wanted
to leave early, and I said she could.</i>

225
00:24:54.765 --> 00:24:57.265
<i>That was the last I saw...
Oh, wait a minute.</i>

226
00:24:57.804 --> 00:25:00.070
<i>I did see her some
time later, driving...</i>

227
00:25:01.274 --> 00:25:04.234
<i>I think you'd better come
over here to my office, quick.</i>

228
00:25:05.265 --> 00:25:07.739
<i>Caroline, get Mr. Cassidy for me.</i>

229
00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:13.829
<i>After all, Cassidy,
I told you, all that cash!</i>

230
00:25:14.454 --> 00:25:16.195
<i>I'm not taking
the responsibility.</i>

231
00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:18.156
<i>Oh, for heaven's sake.</i>

232
00:25:18.453 --> 00:25:20.726
<i>A girl works for you for
10 years, you trust her.</i>

233
00:25:21.378 --> 00:25:23.554
<i>All right, yes, you
better come over.</i>

234
00:25:25.841 --> 00:25:28.668
<i>Well, I ain't about
to kiss off $40,000!</i>

235
00:25:29.051 --> 00:25:32.806
<i>I'll get it back, and if any of it's missing,
I'll replace it with her fine, soft flesh!</i>

236
00:25:33.106 --> 00:25:34.520
<i>I'll track her, never you doubt it.</i>

237
00:25:34.629 --> 00:25:35.809
<i>Hold on, Cassidy.</i>

238
00:25:36.183 --> 00:25:41.440
<i>I still can't believe... It must be
some kind of a mystery. I can't...</i>

239
00:25:41.637 --> 00:25:44.776
<i>You checked with the bank, no?
They never laid eyes on her, no?</i>

240
00:25:44.818 --> 00:25:48.822
<i>You still trusting? Hot creepers! She
sat there while I dumped it out!</i>

241
00:25:49.059 --> 00:25:54.005
<i>Hardly even looked at it. Planning.
And even flirting with me!</i>

242
00:28:18.763 --> 00:28:20.934
Gee, I'm sorry I didn't
hear you in all this rain.

243
00:28:21.641 --> 00:28:22.895
Go ahead in, please.

244
00:28:28.885 --> 00:28:29.886
Dirty night.

245
00:28:30.059 --> 00:28:31.568
You have a vacancy?

246
00:28:31.651 --> 00:28:35.530
Oh, we have 12 vacancies.
Twelve cabins, 12 vacancies.

247
00:28:36.138 --> 00:28:37.817
They... They moved
away the highway.

248
00:28:39.333 --> 00:28:41.106
Oh, I thought I'd gotten
off the main road.

249
00:28:43.246 --> 00:28:44.372
I knew you must have.

250
00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:46.747
Nobody ever stops here anymore
unless they've done that.

251
00:28:48.583 --> 00:28:49.997
But...

252
00:28:50.739 --> 00:28:52.480
there's no sense
dwelling on our losses.

253
00:28:52.505 --> 00:28:56.760
We just keep on lighting the lights
and following the formalities.

254
00:29:00.764 --> 00:29:03.592
Your home address.
Oh, just the town will do.

255
00:29:07.896 --> 00:29:09.481
Los Angeles.

256
00:29:16.998 --> 00:29:19.324
Cabin One. It's closer in
case you want anything.

257
00:29:19.407 --> 00:29:20.659
Right next to the office.

258
00:29:20.742 --> 00:29:23.647
I want sleep more than anything
else, except maybe food.

259
00:29:23.975 --> 00:29:27.139
Well, there's a big diner about 10 miles
up the road, just outside of Fairvale.

260
00:29:27.764 --> 00:29:28.917
Am I that close to Fairvale?

261
00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:31.670
Fifteen miles.
I'll get your bags.

262
00:29:51.014 --> 00:29:52.774
Boy, it's stuffy in here.

263
00:29:58.571 --> 00:30:01.357
Well, the mattress is soft and...

264
00:30:02.053 --> 00:30:05.996
there's hangers in the closet and
stationery with Bates Motel printed on it

265
00:30:06.021 --> 00:30:08.497
in case you wanna make your
friends back home feel envious.

266
00:30:09.544 --> 00:30:10.792
And the...

267
00:30:13.356 --> 00:30:14.200
Over there.

268
00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:16.008
The bathroom.

269
00:30:16.089 --> 00:30:17.257
Yeah.

270
00:30:18.333 --> 00:30:22.387
Well, if you want anything,
just tap on the wall.

271
00:30:22.669 --> 00:30:24.786
- I'll be in the office.
- Thank you, Mr. Bates.

272
00:30:25.028 --> 00:30:26.379
Norman Bates.

273
00:30:30.431 --> 00:30:33.231
You're not really gonna go out again
and drive up to the diner, are you?

274
00:30:33.454 --> 00:30:34.267
No.

275
00:30:34.923 --> 00:30:37.571
Well, then would you do me a favor?
Would you have dinner with me?

276
00:30:37.954 --> 00:30:39.337
I was just about to myself.

277
00:30:39.509 --> 00:30:41.828
You know, nothing special,
just sandwiches and milk.

278
00:30:41.853 --> 00:30:44.813
But I'd like it very much if
you'd come up to the house.

279
00:30:46.704 --> 00:30:49.423
I don't set a fancy table, but
the kitchen's awful homey.

280
00:30:51.056 --> 00:30:52.075
I'd like to.

281
00:30:52.454 --> 00:30:55.545
All right. You get yourself settled
and take off your wet shoes,

282
00:30:55.845 --> 00:30:57.338
and I'll be back as
soon as it's ready.

283
00:30:57.626 --> 00:30:58.673
Okay.

284
00:30:59.542 --> 00:31:01.252
With my... With my
trusty umbrella.

285
00:32:23.395 --> 00:32:25.760
No! I tell you no!

286
00:32:26.106 --> 00:32:29.097
I won't have you bringing strange
young girls in for supper!

287
00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:32.600
By candlelight, I suppose,
in the cheap, erotic fashion

288
00:32:32.684 --> 00:32:34.973
of young men with cheap,
erotic minds!

289
00:32:35.278 --> 00:32:36.729
Mother, please.

290
00:32:36.966 --> 00:32:40.020
And then what,
after supper? Music? Whispers?

291
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:43.319
Mother, she's just a stranger.
She's hungry and it's raining out.

292
00:32:43.403 --> 00:32:45.405
"Mother, she's just a stranger.”

293
00:32:45.488 --> 00:32:48.567
As if men don't desire strangers.
As if...

294
00:32:49.450 --> 00:32:52.996
I refuse to speak of disgusting
things, because they disgust me!

295
00:32:53.661 --> 00:32:55.739
You understand, boy? Go on.

296
00:32:55.919 --> 00:32:58.909
Go tell her she'll not be
appeasing her ugly appetite

297
00:32:58.934 --> 00:33:01.380
with my food or my son!

298
00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:04.387
Or do I have to tell her 'cause
you don't have the guts?

299
00:33:04.757 --> 00:33:06.843
Huh, boy? You have
the guts, boy?

300
00:33:07.247 --> 00:33:08.761
Shut up! Shut up!

301
00:33:50.637 --> 00:33:51.971
I've caused you some trouble.

302
00:33:52.527 --> 00:33:53.613
No.

303
00:33:54.807 --> 00:33:56.809
Mother... My mother...

304
00:33:57.644 --> 00:33:58.926
What is the phrase?

305
00:34:00.313 --> 00:34:02.649
She isn't quite herself today.

306
00:34:03.613 --> 00:34:07.183
You shouldn't have bothered. I really
don't have that much of an appetite.

307
00:34:09.239 --> 00:34:10.691
Oh, I'm sorry.

308
00:34:13.451 --> 00:34:16.154
I wish you could apologize
for other people.

309
00:34:17.224 --> 00:34:18.466
Don't worry about it.

310
00:34:18.966 --> 00:34:21.802
But as long as you've fixed a
supper, we may as well eat it.

311
00:34:32.845 --> 00:34:37.517
It might be nicer and
warmer in the office.

312
00:34:51.968 --> 00:34:53.343
Well, it stopped raining.

313
00:34:53.741 --> 00:34:56.820
Eating in an office
is just too officious.

314
00:34:57.453 --> 00:34:58.913
I have the parlor back here.

315
00:34:59.515 --> 00:35:00.414
All right.

316
00:35:15.398 --> 00:35:16.226
Sit down.

317
00:35:17.742 --> 00:35:18.763
Thank you.

318
00:35:21.811 --> 00:35:23.219
You're very kind.

319
00:35:24.969 --> 00:35:27.476
It's all for you. I'm not hungry.
Go ahead.

320
00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:36.622
You... You eat like a bird.

321
00:35:38.161 --> 00:35:39.435
And you'd know, of course.

322
00:35:41.029 --> 00:35:42.138
No, not really.

323
00:35:43.115 --> 00:35:45.918
Anyway, I hear the expression
"Eats like a bird"

324
00:35:46.002 --> 00:35:50.131
is really a false... Falsity.

325
00:35:51.091 --> 00:35:53.843
Because birds really
eat a tremendous lot.

326
00:35:56.804 --> 00:35:59.943
But I don't really know
anything about birds.

327
00:36:00.255 --> 00:36:01.872
My hobby is stuffing things.

328
00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:03.857
You know, taxidermy.

329
00:36:04.812 --> 00:36:07.940
And I guess I'd just rather
stuff birds because

330
00:36:08.691 --> 00:36:10.982
I hate the look of beasts
when they're stuffed.

331
00:36:11.319 --> 00:36:13.068
You know, foxes and chimps.

332
00:36:13.404 --> 00:36:17.263
Some people even stuff dogs and
cats, but, oh, I can't do that.

333
00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:20.185
I think only birds look
well stuffed because...

334
00:36:20.453 --> 00:36:23.790
Well, because they're kind
of passive to begin with.

335
00:36:24.624 --> 00:36:27.443
It's a strange hobby. Curious.

336
00:36:28.002 --> 00:36:29.474
Uncommon, too.

337
00:36:29.849 --> 00:36:31.029
Oh, I imagine so.

338
00:36:31.464 --> 00:36:34.458
And it's not as expensive as you'd think.
It's cheap, really.

339
00:36:34.884 --> 00:36:37.185
You know, needles
and thread, sawdust.

340
00:36:37.637 --> 00:36:40.224
The chemicals are the only
thing that cost anything.

341
00:36:40.575 --> 00:36:41.880
A man should have a hobby.

342
00:36:43.142 --> 00:36:46.979
Well, it's... It's
more than a hobby.

343
00:36:49.349 --> 00:36:52.633
A hobby's supposed to
pass the time, not fill it.

344
00:36:53.236 --> 00:36:54.529
Is your time so empty?

345
00:36:55.341 --> 00:36:56.364
No.

346
00:36:58.122 --> 00:36:59.700
Well, I run the office

347
00:37:00.451 --> 00:37:02.787
and tend the cabins and grounds

348
00:37:02.912 --> 00:37:05.482
and do little errands
for my mother.

349
00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:08.740
The ones she allows
I might be capable of doing.

350
00:37:09.752 --> 00:37:10.888
Do you go out with friends?

351
00:37:14.799 --> 00:37:16.857
Well, a boy's best
friend is his mother.

352
00:37:19.887 --> 00:37:23.286
You've never had an empty moment
in your entire life, have you?

353
00:37:25.911 --> 00:37:26.896
Only my share.

354
00:37:28.247 --> 00:37:29.599
Where are you going?

355
00:37:32.024 --> 00:37:33.154
I didn't mean to cry.

356
00:37:34.026 --> 00:37:35.943
I'm looking for
a private island.

357
00:37:37.904 --> 00:37:39.255
What are you running away from?

358
00:37:42.685 --> 00:37:43.865
Why do you ask that?

359
00:37:44.408 --> 00:37:45.404
I don't know.

360
00:37:46.789 --> 00:37:49.333
People never run
away from anything.

361
00:37:52.086 --> 00:37:56.115
The rain didn't last long, did it?
You know what I think?

362
00:37:57.068 --> 00:37:58.380
I think that

363
00:38:00.761 --> 00:38:02.802
we're all in our private traps,

364
00:38:03.931 --> 00:38:08.083
clamped in them,
and none of us can ever get out.

365
00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:11.856
We scratch and claw,

366
00:38:12.773 --> 00:38:15.365
but only at the air,
only at each other.

367
00:38:16.444 --> 00:38:19.906
And for all of it,
we never budge an inch.

368
00:38:21.157 --> 00:38:23.669
Sometimes we deliberately
step into those traps.

369
00:38:26.787 --> 00:38:29.286
I was born in mine.
I don't mind it anymore.

370
00:38:29.927 --> 00:38:32.668
Oh, but you should.
You should mind it.

371
00:38:32.752 --> 00:38:35.247
Oh, I do, but I say I don't.

372
00:38:38.007 --> 00:38:42.161
You know, if anyone ever
talked to me the way I heard,

373
00:38:42.762 --> 00:38:44.764
the way she spoke to you...

374
00:38:46.766 --> 00:38:49.513
Sometimes when she
talks to me like that,

375
00:38:50.186 --> 00:38:54.810
I feel I'd like to go up there and
curse her and leave her forever.

376
00:38:55.358 --> 00:38:57.151
Or at least defy her.

377
00:39:01.781 --> 00:39:03.202
But I know I can't.

378
00:39:05.273 --> 00:39:06.085
She's ill.

379
00:39:07.286 --> 00:39:08.515
She sounded strong.

380
00:39:10.206 --> 00:39:11.832
No, I mean ill.

381
00:39:14.168 --> 00:39:17.382
She had to raise me all by
herself, after my father died.

382
00:39:17.913 --> 00:39:20.593
I was only five and it must've
been quite a strain for her.

383
00:39:21.676 --> 00:39:23.921
I mean, she didn't have to go
to work or anything like that.

384
00:39:24.202 --> 00:39:25.921
He left her a little money.

385
00:39:26.764 --> 00:39:30.685
Anyway, a few years ago,
Mother met this man.

386
00:39:31.143 --> 00:39:34.132
And he talked her
into building this motel.

387
00:39:34.564 --> 00:39:36.429
He could have talked
her into anything.

388
00:39:37.093 --> 00:39:41.390
And when he died, too, it was
just too great a shock for her.

389
00:39:42.738 --> 00:39:44.273
And the way he died...

390
00:39:47.868 --> 00:39:50.382
I guess it's nothing to talk
about while you're eating.

391
00:39:51.330 --> 00:39:55.921
Anyway, it was just too great a
loss for her. She had nothing left.

392
00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:59.070
Except you.

393
00:40:00.256 --> 00:40:02.562
Well, a son is a poor
substitute for a lover.

394
00:40:04.515 --> 00:40:05.804
Why don't you go away?

395
00:40:07.921 --> 00:40:09.382
To a private island, like you?

396
00:40:13.644 --> 00:40:16.253
No, not like me.

397
00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:20.479
I couldn't do that.
Who'd look after her?

398
00:40:21.995 --> 00:40:23.401
She'd be alone up there.

399
00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:26.699
Her fire would go out.

400
00:40:27.542 --> 00:40:29.785
It'd be cold and
damp like a grave.

401
00:40:31.573 --> 00:40:32.831
If you love someone,

402
00:40:33.487 --> 00:40:35.956
you don't do that to them,
even if you hate them.

403
00:40:37.753 --> 00:40:40.276
You understand,
I don't hate her.

404
00:40:42.175 --> 00:40:43.883
I hate what she's become.

405
00:40:45.144 --> 00:40:46.362
I hate the illness.

406
00:40:48.519 --> 00:40:50.806
Wouldn't it be better
if you put her

407
00:40:52.636 --> 00:40:53.604
someplace...

408
00:40:57.722 --> 00:41:01.104
You mean an institution?
A madhouse?

409
00:41:05.058 --> 00:41:07.526
People always call a madhouse
"someplace," don't they?

410
00:41:08.495 --> 00:41:10.440
Put her in someplace.

411
00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:15.112
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
it to sound uncaring.

412
00:41:16.026 --> 00:41:17.644
What do you know about caring?

413
00:41:18.534 --> 00:41:20.933
Have you ever seen the inside
of one of those places?

414
00:41:21.847 --> 00:41:23.756
The laughing and the tears

415
00:41:24.784 --> 00:41:27.276
and the cruel eyes studying you.

416
00:41:27.745 --> 00:41:29.136
My mother there?

417
00:41:32.104 --> 00:41:33.354
But she's harmless.

418
00:41:36.144 --> 00:41:38.769
She's as harmless as
one of those stuffed birds.

419
00:41:40.354 --> 00:41:41.691
I am sorry.

420
00:41:42.722 --> 00:41:46.894
I only felt... It seems
she's hurting you.

421
00:41:48.237 --> 00:41:49.534
I meant well.

422
00:41:50.214 --> 00:41:51.325
People always mean well.

423
00:41:52.503 --> 00:41:54.578
They cluck their thick tongues
and shake their heads

424
00:41:54.662 --> 00:41:57.206
and suggest,
oh, so very delicately.

425
00:42:04.755 --> 00:42:07.341
Of course, I've
suggested it myself.

426
00:42:09.219 --> 00:42:11.173
But I hate to even
think about it.

427
00:42:12.352 --> 00:42:13.688
She needs me.

428
00:42:18.032 --> 00:42:19.774
It's not as if she were

429
00:42:20.376 --> 00:42:22.993
a maniac, a raving thing.

430
00:42:25.592 --> 00:42:28.774
She just goes a little
mad sometimes.

431
00:42:31.587 --> 00:42:33.610
We all go a little
mad sometimes.

432
00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:37.913
Haven't you?

433
00:42:40.243 --> 00:42:41.370
Yes.

434
00:42:42.524 --> 00:42:45.171
Sometimes just one
time can be enough.

435
00:42:46.977 --> 00:42:47.790
Thank you.

436
00:42:49.587 --> 00:42:51.016
Thank you, Norman.

437
00:42:51.844 --> 00:42:52.934
Norman.

438
00:42:54.329 --> 00:42:57.415
Oh, you're not going back
to your room already?

439
00:42:58.618 --> 00:42:59.810
I'm very tired.

440
00:43:00.235 --> 00:43:03.344
And I have a long drive tomorrow,
all the way back to Phoenix.

441
00:43:04.399 --> 00:43:05.243
Really?

442
00:43:06.484 --> 00:43:09.219
I stepped into a
private trap back there

443
00:43:10.313 --> 00:43:13.282
and I'd like to go back and
try to pull myself out of it

444
00:43:15.743 --> 00:43:17.161
before it's too
late for me, too.

445
00:43:17.407 --> 00:43:19.997
Are you sure you wouldn't like to
stay just a little while longer?

446
00:43:20.735 --> 00:43:21.957
Just for talk?

447
00:43:22.641 --> 00:43:24.094
Oh, I'd like to, but...

448
00:43:24.610 --> 00:43:25.594
All right.

449
00:43:25.977 --> 00:43:29.149
Well, I'll see you in the morning.
I'll bring you some breakfast, all right?

450
00:43:29.712 --> 00:43:30.800
What time?

451
00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:32.173
Very early. Dawn.

452
00:43:32.938 --> 00:43:34.180
All right, Miss...

453
00:43:34.493 --> 00:43:35.554
Crane.

454
00:43:35.638 --> 00:43:36.641
Crane. That's it.

455
00:43:36.969 --> 00:43:38.087
Good night.

456
00:49:59.096 --> 00:50:01.229
Mother! Oh, God, Mother!

457
00:50:01.533 --> 00:50:03.424
Blood! Blood!

458
01:00:36.157 --> 01:00:37.610
I've tried many brands.

459
01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:42.110
So far, of those I've used, I haven't
had much luck with any of them.

460
01:00:42.601 --> 01:00:44.446
Let's see what they
say about this one.

461
01:00:45.289 --> 01:00:47.219
They tell you what
its ingredients are

462
01:00:47.688 --> 01:00:51.589
and how it's guaranteed to exterminate
every insect in the world,

463
01:00:52.173 --> 01:00:54.367
but they do not tell you
whether or not it's painless.

464
01:00:54.843 --> 01:00:58.703
And I say, insect or man, death
should always be painless.

465
01:00:59.532 --> 01:01:01.599
I suppose, this one seems to
claim more and better

466
01:01:01.683 --> 01:01:03.117
qualities than lots
of the others.

467
01:01:15.363 --> 01:01:16.573
Sam?

468
01:01:17.156 --> 01:01:19.576
Sam! Lady wants to see you.

469
01:01:25.915 --> 01:01:26.916
Yes, miss?

470
01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.376
I'm Marion's sister.

471
01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:30.169
Oh, sure. Lila.

472
01:01:30.169 --> 01:01:31.196
Is Marion here?

473
01:01:33.187 --> 01:01:34.522
- Well, of course not.
- Thank you.

474
01:01:34.591 --> 01:01:35.594
Something wrong?

475
01:01:39.719 --> 01:01:41.290
She left home on Friday.

476
01:01:41.579 --> 01:01:45.118
I was in Tucson over the weekend and
I haven't heard from her since.

477
01:01:45.143 --> 01:01:46.610
Not even a phone call.

478
01:01:47.770 --> 01:01:50.899
Look, if you two are in this together,
I don't care, it's none of my business,

479
01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:53.026
but I want to talk to Marion
and I want her to tell me

480
01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:54.602
it's none of my business
and then I'll go...

481
01:01:54.868 --> 01:01:57.452
Bob, run out and get yourself
some lunch, will you?

482
01:01:58.156 --> 01:02:00.015
That's okay, Sam.
I brought it with me.

483
01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:01.156
Run out and eat it.

484
01:02:06.831 --> 01:02:09.751
Now, what thing could
we be in together?

485
01:02:10.168 --> 01:02:12.170
Sorry about the tears.

486
01:02:12.837 --> 01:02:15.632
Well, is Marion in trouble?
What is it?

487
01:02:16.132 --> 01:02:18.604
Let's all talk about
Marion, shall we?

488
01:02:22.430 --> 01:02:23.914
Who are you, friend?

489
01:02:24.515 --> 01:02:26.476
My name is Arbogast, friend.

490
01:02:26.809 --> 01:02:28.305
I'm a private investigator.

491
01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:30.969
Where is she, Miss Crane?

492
01:02:31.953 --> 01:02:32.976
I don't know you.

493
01:02:33.492 --> 01:02:36.601
Why, I know you don't, because if you
did, I wouldn't be able to follow you.

494
01:02:37.195 --> 01:02:38.906
What's your interest in this?

495
01:02:40.121 --> 01:02:42.687
Well, $40,000.

496
01:02:44.305 --> 01:02:46.204
- $40,000?
- That's right.

497
01:02:50.234 --> 01:02:52.335
Well, one of you'd better tell me
what's going on, and tell me fast.

498
01:02:52.377 --> 01:02:53.461
I can take just so
much of this...

499
01:02:53.503 --> 01:02:54.671
Now, take it easy, friend.

500
01:02:54.754 --> 01:02:59.217
Take it easy. It's just that
your girlfriend stole $40,000.

501
01:02:59.390 --> 01:03:01.476
What are you talking about?
What is this?

502
01:03:01.886 --> 01:03:06.099
She was supposed to bank it on
Friday for her boss and she didn't.

503
01:03:06.383 --> 01:03:07.976
And no one has seen her since.

504
01:03:08.133 --> 01:03:09.594
Someone has seen her.

505
01:03:09.769 --> 01:03:12.187
Someone always sees
a girl with $40,000.

506
01:03:12.939 --> 01:03:15.617
Sam, they don't want to prosecute,
they just want the money back.

507
01:03:15.817 --> 01:03:16.985
Sam, if she's here...

508
01:03:17.068 --> 01:03:18.820
She isn't. She isn't.

509
01:03:18.903 --> 01:03:20.398
Miss Crane, can I
ask you a question?

510
01:03:20.726 --> 01:03:23.324
Did you come up here on just
a hunch and nothing more?

511
01:03:23.415 --> 01:03:25.492
Not even a hunch. Just hope.

512
01:03:25.785 --> 01:03:28.008
Well, with a little checking
I could get to believe you.

513
01:03:29.747 --> 01:03:31.875
I don't care if you
believe me or not.

514
01:03:32.258 --> 01:03:35.523
All I want to do is see Marion
before she gets in this too deeply.

515
01:03:35.712 --> 01:03:39.215
Did you check in Phoenix? Hospitals?
Maybe she had an accident, or a holdup.

516
01:03:39.215 --> 01:03:41.217
No, she was seen leaving
town in her own car,

517
01:03:41.217 --> 01:03:43.428
by her employer, I might add.

518
01:03:43.970 --> 01:03:46.180
I can't believe it. Can you?

519
01:03:47.853 --> 01:03:50.309
Well, you know, we're always
quickest to doubt people

520
01:03:50.393 --> 01:03:52.642
who have a reputation
for being honest.

521
01:03:53.146 --> 01:03:54.760
I think she's here, Miss Crane.

522
01:03:55.356 --> 01:03:56.924
Where there's a boyfriend...

523
01:03:58.244 --> 01:03:59.986
Well, she's not back there
with the nuts and bolts,

524
01:04:00.028 --> 01:04:02.572
but she's here,
in this town somewhere.

525
01:04:03.197 --> 01:04:05.616
I'll find her.
I'll be seeing you.

526
01:04:42.945 --> 01:04:44.374
- Evening.
- Evening.

527
01:04:44.906 --> 01:04:46.382
I almost drove right past.

528
01:04:46.699 --> 01:04:49.413
I'm always forgetting to turn the
sign on, but we do have a vacancy.

529
01:04:49.869 --> 01:04:52.671
Twelve, in fact. Twelve cabins,
twelve vacancies. Candy?

530
01:04:52.955 --> 01:04:54.030
No, thanks.

531
01:04:54.616 --> 01:04:57.627
Last two days, I've been to so many
motels my eyes are bleary with neon,

532
01:04:57.710 --> 01:05:00.562
but, you know, this is the first place that
looks like it's hiding from the world.

533
01:05:01.257 --> 01:05:04.175
Well, I'll tell you the truth. I didn't
really forget to turn the sign on.

534
01:05:04.175 --> 01:05:07.428
Just doesn't seem like any
use anymore, you know.

535
01:05:08.429 --> 01:05:10.788
See, that used to be
the main highway right there.

536
01:05:11.663 --> 01:05:12.795
Well, wanna come
in and register?

537
01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:14.268
No, no, sit down.
I don't wanna trouble you.

538
01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:15.978
I just wanna ask
a few questions.

539
01:05:16.062 --> 01:05:17.605
No, that's no trouble.
Today's linen day.

540
01:05:17.647 --> 01:05:20.191
I always change the beds here once a
week whether they've been used or not.

541
01:05:20.233 --> 01:05:22.320
Hate the smell of dampness,
don't you? It's such a...

542
01:05:22.902 --> 01:05:24.570
I don't know, creepy smell.
Come on.

543
01:05:26.948 --> 01:05:28.908
You out to buy a motel?

544
01:05:30.535 --> 01:05:31.744
No.

545
01:05:32.203 --> 01:05:33.788
Reason I ask, you said
you'd seen so many

546
01:05:33.830 --> 01:05:36.015
in the past couple of days,
I thought maybe you...

547
01:05:37.083 --> 01:05:39.523
What... What was it
you wanted to ask?

548
01:05:39.843 --> 01:05:42.195
Well, you see, I'm looking
for a missing person.

549
01:05:42.547 --> 01:05:45.265
My name's Arbogast.
I'm a private investigator.

550
01:05:45.967 --> 01:05:47.695
I've been trying to trace a girl

551
01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:51.312
that's been missing for, oh,
about a week now from Phoenix.

552
01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:53.859
It's a private matter. The
family wants to forgive her.

553
01:05:54.327 --> 01:05:55.648
She's not in any trouble.

554
01:05:56.936 --> 01:05:59.476
I didn't think the police went looking
for people who aren't in trouble.

555
01:05:59.772 --> 01:06:01.507
- I'm not the police.
- Oh, yeah.

556
01:06:02.024 --> 01:06:03.943
We have reason to believe
that she came along this way.

557
01:06:03.985 --> 01:06:06.109
May have stopped in the area.
Did she stop here?

558
01:06:06.445 --> 01:06:08.070
Well, no one's stopped here
for a couple of weeks.

559
01:06:09.038 --> 01:06:11.179
Would you mind looking at the
picture before committing yourself?

560
01:06:11.450 --> 01:06:12.785
Commit myself?

561
01:06:12.869 --> 01:06:14.537
You sure talk like a policeman.

562
01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:16.124
Look at the picture, please.

563
01:06:18.499 --> 01:06:19.780
- Sure?
- Yeah.

564
01:06:21.169 --> 01:06:22.788
Well, she may have
used an alias.

565
01:06:23.546 --> 01:06:25.131
Marion Crane's her real name,

566
01:06:25.173 --> 01:06:27.921
but she could've registered
under a different one.

567
01:06:28.926 --> 01:06:32.866
Well, I tell you, I don't even much
bother with guests registering anymore.

568
01:06:32.891 --> 01:06:35.476
You know, one by one,
you drop the formalities.

569
01:06:35.808 --> 01:06:37.796
I shouldn't even bother
changing the sheets,

570
01:06:37.821 --> 01:06:39.546
but old habits die hard.

571
01:06:40.563 --> 01:06:42.273
Which reminds me...

572
01:06:43.203 --> 01:06:44.352
What's that?

573
01:06:44.672 --> 01:06:46.485
It's the light. The sign.

574
01:06:46.694 --> 01:06:49.447
We had a couple last week, said
if the thing hadn't been on,

575
01:06:49.530 --> 01:06:51.336
they would've thought
this was an old, deserted...

576
01:06:51.866 --> 01:06:53.852
Well, you see, that's
exactly my point.

577
01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:56.078
You said that nobody'd been
here for a couple weeks,

578
01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:58.915
and there's a couple came by and
didn't know that you were open.

579
01:06:58.998 --> 01:06:59.999
Yeah.

580
01:07:00.374 --> 01:07:02.251
Well, as you say,
old habits die hard.

581
01:07:02.335 --> 01:07:05.266
It's possible, this girl could've
registered under another name.

582
01:07:05.296 --> 01:07:06.453
Do you mind if I
look at your book?

583
01:07:07.173 --> 01:07:09.133
- No.
- Thank you.

584
01:07:12.178 --> 01:07:13.387
All right.

585
01:07:13.471 --> 01:07:14.781
I'll get the date somewhere.

586
01:07:17.183 --> 01:07:18.188
See, there's nobody.

587
01:07:18.935 --> 01:07:22.647
Let's see now, I have a sample
of her handwriting here.

588
01:07:24.398 --> 01:07:25.775
Oh, yes.

589
01:07:26.692 --> 01:07:27.875
Here we are.

590
01:07:28.361 --> 01:07:31.280
Marie Samuels.
That's an interesting alias.

591
01:07:32.323 --> 01:07:33.320
Is that her?

592
01:07:33.345 --> 01:07:34.774
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

593
01:07:34.951 --> 01:07:36.994
Marie, Marion.

594
01:07:37.078 --> 01:07:39.086
Samuels. Her boyfriend's
name is Sam.

595
01:07:41.165 --> 01:07:43.709
Was she in disguise,
by any chance?

596
01:07:45.242 --> 01:07:46.765
Wanna check the picture again?

597
01:07:47.171 --> 01:07:48.589
Look, I wasn't lying
to you, Mr...

598
01:07:48.673 --> 01:07:50.758
Oh, I know that. I know
you wouldn't lie.

599
01:07:50.841 --> 01:07:52.718
You know, it's tough keeping
track of the time around here.

600
01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:53.890
Oh, I know, I know.

601
01:07:55.179 --> 01:07:56.703
Oh, yeah.

602
01:07:57.014 --> 01:07:58.773
Well, it was raining and...

603
01:08:00.351 --> 01:08:02.186
her hair was all wet.

604
01:08:02.186 --> 01:08:05.064
I tell you, it's not really a
very good picture of her either.

605
01:08:05.147 --> 01:08:06.390
No, I guess not.

606
01:08:06.711 --> 01:08:07.734
Tell me all about her.

607
01:08:08.234 --> 01:08:09.568
Well,

608
01:08:10.152 --> 01:08:14.323
she arrived rather late one night,
and she went straight to sleep

609
01:08:14.407 --> 01:08:16.883
and left early the next morning.

610
01:08:17.159 --> 01:08:18.452
How early?

611
01:08:18.536 --> 01:08:20.204
Oh, very early.

612
01:08:21.414 --> 01:08:22.765
Which morning was that?

613
01:08:23.708 --> 01:08:24.883
The...

614
01:08:27.878 --> 01:08:29.213
The next morning. Sunday.

615
01:08:29.297 --> 01:08:30.390
I see.

616
01:08:31.215 --> 01:08:33.301
- Did anyone meet her here?
- No.

617
01:08:33.384 --> 01:08:34.797
Did she arrive with anyone?

618
01:08:35.664 --> 01:08:36.574
No.

619
01:08:37.151 --> 01:08:38.193
Did she make
any phone calls or...

620
01:08:38.328 --> 01:08:39.015
No.

621
01:08:39.098 --> 01:08:40.133
Locally?

622
01:08:41.183 --> 01:08:42.390
Did you spend the
night with her?

623
01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:45.187
No.

624
01:08:45.187 --> 01:08:47.953
Well then, how would you know that
she didn't make any phone calls?

625
01:08:52.778 --> 01:08:54.739
Well, she was very tired and...

626
01:08:54.822 --> 01:08:58.159
See, now I'm
starting to remember.

627
01:08:58.159 --> 01:08:59.936
I'm making a mental
picture of it in my mind.

628
01:08:59.961 --> 01:09:01.787
You know, if you make a mental
picturization of something...

629
01:09:01.829 --> 01:09:03.179
That's right. That's right.
Take your time.

630
01:09:04.457 --> 01:09:06.917
She was... She was
sitting back there...

631
01:09:07.001 --> 01:09:09.406
No, no, she was standing back
there with a sandwich in her hand

632
01:09:09.843 --> 01:09:11.589
and she said she had
to go to sleep early

633
01:09:11.672 --> 01:09:16.761
because she had a
long drive ahead of her.

634
01:09:17.303 --> 01:09:19.263
- Back where?
- Back where she came from.

635
01:09:19.347 --> 01:09:22.224
No, you said before that she was sitting
back there... Standing back there...

636
01:09:22.266 --> 01:09:24.769
Yes, back in my parlor there.

637
01:09:24.852 --> 01:09:26.859
She was very hungry
and I made her a sandwich

638
01:09:27.031 --> 01:09:32.401
and then she said that she was tired
and she had to go right to bed.

639
01:09:32.485 --> 01:09:34.179
I see. How did she pay you?

640
01:09:34.820 --> 01:09:36.023
- Cash? Check?
- Cash.

641
01:09:36.048 --> 01:09:37.383
Cash, huh?

642
01:09:38.491 --> 01:09:40.910
And after she left,
she didn't come back?

643
01:09:41.464 --> 01:09:42.549
Well, why should she?

644
01:09:42.574 --> 01:09:43.575
Yeah.

645
01:09:47.935 --> 01:09:51.021
Well, Mr. Arbogast,
I guess that's about it.

646
01:09:51.879 --> 01:09:53.828
I've got some work to do,
if you don't mind.

647
01:09:54.465 --> 01:09:56.509
Well, to tell you
the truth, I do mind.

648
01:09:56.592 --> 01:10:00.273
You see, if it doesn't jell, it isn't
aspic, and this ain't jelling.

649
01:10:00.846 --> 01:10:02.468
It's not coming together.
Something's missing.

650
01:10:04.375 --> 01:10:06.812
Well, I don't know what you
could expect me to know.

651
01:10:07.895 --> 01:10:09.271
People just come
and go, you know.

652
01:10:09.355 --> 01:10:11.725
That's right. She isn't
still here, is she?

653
01:10:12.593 --> 01:10:13.703
No.

654
01:10:15.152 --> 01:10:17.875
If I wanted to check the
cabins, all 12 of them,

655
01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:19.382
I'd need a warrant, wouldn't I?

656
01:10:19.407 --> 01:10:22.326
Listen, if you don't believe me, come on
with me. You can help me change beds.

657
01:10:22.368 --> 01:10:25.008
- Okay?
- Oh. No, thanks.

658
01:10:42.721 --> 01:10:43.869
Change your mind?

659
01:10:47.643 --> 01:10:51.772
You know, I... I think I must have one of
those faces you just can't help believing.

660
01:10:51.856 --> 01:10:53.369
- Is anyone at home?
- No.

661
01:10:54.181 --> 01:10:56.110
Oh? There's somebody
sitting up in the window.

662
01:10:56.152 --> 01:10:57.088
No, no, there isn't.

663
01:10:57.113 --> 01:10:58.236
Sure, go ahead. Take a look.

664
01:10:58.487 --> 01:11:00.228
Oh, that must be my mother.

665
01:11:00.767 --> 01:11:02.713
She's an invalid.

666
01:11:03.159 --> 01:11:05.258
It's practically like
living alone.

667
01:11:05.283 --> 01:11:06.704
Oh, I see.

668
01:11:07.997 --> 01:11:12.251
Now, if this girl, Marion Crane, were here,
you wouldn't be hiding her, would you?

669
01:11:12.276 --> 01:11:14.879
- No.
- Not even if she paid you well?

670
01:11:14.962 --> 01:11:15.869
No.

671
01:11:16.589 --> 01:11:18.666
Let's just say, just for
the sake of argument,

672
01:11:18.691 --> 01:11:21.719
that she wanted you to
gallantly protect her.

673
01:11:21.802 --> 01:11:23.679
You'd know that you
were being used.

674
01:11:23.762 --> 01:11:25.139
You wouldn't be made
a fool of, would you?

675
01:11:25.139 --> 01:11:26.724
- But I'm not a fool.
- Well, I...

676
01:11:26.807 --> 01:11:29.533
And I'm not capable of being
fooled, not even by a woman.

677
01:11:30.088 --> 01:11:31.352
Well, this is not a slur
on your manhood.

678
01:11:31.377 --> 01:11:32.371
Let's put it this way.

679
01:11:32.396 --> 01:11:36.080
She might have fooled me, but
she didn't fool my mother.

680
01:11:36.317 --> 01:11:38.277
Well, then your mother met her.
Could I talk to your mother?

681
01:11:38.319 --> 01:11:41.155
No. As I told you,
she's confined.

682
01:11:41.155 --> 01:11:42.406
Yes, but just for a
few minutes. That's all.

683
01:11:42.448 --> 01:11:44.575
There might be some hint
that you missed out on.

684
01:11:44.658 --> 01:11:47.077
You know, sick old women
are usually pretty sharp.

685
01:11:47.161 --> 01:11:48.496
- Just for a moment.
- Mr. Arbogast...

686
01:11:48.579 --> 01:11:49.973
- I wouldn't disturb her.
- I think I've...

687
01:11:50.831 --> 01:11:52.823
I think I've talked
to you all I want to.

688
01:11:52.848 --> 01:11:53.667
Yes, but just for...

689
01:11:53.751 --> 01:11:55.848
I think it'd be much better
if you left now. Thanks.

690
01:11:57.004 --> 01:11:59.067
Well, all right.

691
01:11:59.621 --> 01:12:02.943
You sure would save me a lot of leg
work if you'd let me talk to her.

692
01:12:02.968 --> 01:12:04.094
Would I need a
warrant for that, too?

693
01:12:04.136 --> 01:12:05.179
Sure.

694
01:12:06.430 --> 01:12:08.214
All right. Thanks anyway.

695
01:13:02.903 --> 01:13:06.031
Hello, Loomis. This is Arbogast.
Is Lila there?

696
01:13:06.637 --> 01:13:08.020
Okay. Let me talk to her, please.

697
01:13:09.868 --> 01:13:11.203
Hello, Lila.

698
01:13:12.037 --> 01:13:14.832
Lila, listen.
Marion was up here.

699
01:13:15.833 --> 01:13:18.460
Yes, she spent last Saturday
night at the Bates Motel.

700
01:13:18.544 --> 01:13:20.067
It's right out here
on the old highway.

701
01:13:20.434 --> 01:13:22.785
I even know what cabin she
was in. It was number one.

702
01:13:24.341 --> 01:13:28.762
Well, this young fella that runs the place
said that she just spent the night,

703
01:13:28.846 --> 01:13:30.551
left the next day
and that was it.

704
01:13:33.809 --> 01:13:35.238
No, not exactly.

705
01:13:36.645 --> 01:13:40.449
Well, I did question him, believe me,
but I think I got all there was to get.

706
01:13:41.191 --> 01:13:43.074
I'll just have to pick up
the pieces from here.

707
01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:47.973
Well, I tell you, I don't
feel entirely satisfied...

708
01:13:48.504 --> 01:13:50.535
See, this boy had
a sick old mother.

709
01:13:50.868 --> 01:13:53.270
I think she saw Marion
and talked to her.

710
01:13:53.886 --> 01:13:56.355
No. No, unfortunately,
he wouldn't let me see her.

711
01:13:57.458 --> 01:14:01.170
Well, I was, but I think I'll
go back to the motel first.

712
01:14:02.348 --> 01:14:05.098
No, you stay there with Loomis.
I'll be back in about an hour.

713
01:14:05.966 --> 01:14:07.856
All right, fine. Listen, I...

714
01:14:08.177 --> 01:14:09.824
You'll be happy to
know what I think.

715
01:14:10.679 --> 01:14:14.767
I think our friend Sam Loomis
didn't know that Marion was here.

716
01:14:16.393 --> 01:14:19.563
Yeah. All right. See you
in about an hour or less.

717
01:14:19.647 --> 01:14:20.689
All right, bye-bye.

718
01:15:17.394 --> 01:15:18.660
Bates?

719
01:17:55.287 --> 01:17:57.724
Sometimes Saturday night
has a lonely sound.

720
01:17:58.073 --> 01:17:59.411
Ever notice that, Lila?

721
01:18:01.521 --> 01:18:03.630
Sam, he said an hour or less.

722
01:18:04.329 --> 01:18:05.419
Yeah.

723
01:18:07.654 --> 01:18:08.792
It's been three.

724
01:18:08.876 --> 01:18:10.716
Well, are we just going
to sit here and wait?

725
01:18:11.128 --> 01:18:12.388
He'll be back.

726
01:18:13.247 --> 01:18:15.465
Let's sit still and
hang on, okay?

727
01:18:20.929 --> 01:18:22.319
How far is the old highway?

728
01:18:22.598 --> 01:18:23.811
You wanna go out there,
don't you?

729
01:18:24.308 --> 01:18:26.018
- Bust in on Arbogast and the old lady...
- Yes.

730
01:18:26.059 --> 01:18:27.644
- Maybe shake her up.
- Yes!

731
01:18:27.728 --> 01:18:29.271
That wouldn't be a
wise thing to do.

732
01:18:29.354 --> 01:18:31.148
Patience doesn't run
in my family, Sam.

733
01:18:31.148 --> 01:18:32.941
- I'm going out there.
- Look, Arbogast said...

734
01:18:33.025 --> 01:18:34.710
An hour, or less.

735
01:18:39.663 --> 01:18:40.858
Well, I'm going.

736
01:18:41.694 --> 01:18:42.826
You'll never find it.

737
01:18:46.705 --> 01:18:47.831
Stay here.

738
01:18:48.134 --> 01:18:49.187
Why can't I go with you?

739
01:18:49.212 --> 01:18:52.392
I don't know. One of us has to be
here, in case he's on the way.

740
01:18:52.961 --> 01:18:55.130
What am I supposed to do,
just sit here and wait?

741
01:18:55.130 --> 01:18:57.090
Yeah. Stay here.

742
01:19:17.819 --> 01:19:19.154
Arbogast?

743
01:19:20.467 --> 01:19:21.865
Arbogast!

744
01:19:25.043 --> 01:19:26.378
Arbogast!

745
01:19:56.650 --> 01:19:57.693
He didn't come back here?

746
01:19:58.126 --> 01:19:59.152
Sam!

747
01:19:59.152 --> 01:20:02.698
No Arbogast, no Bates.
Only the old lady at home.

748
01:20:02.781 --> 01:20:05.701
Sick old lady unable to answer
the door, or unwilling.

749
01:20:05.892 --> 01:20:07.189
Where could he have gone?

750
01:20:07.931 --> 01:20:10.080
Maybe he got some definite lead.
Maybe he went right on.

751
01:20:10.122 --> 01:20:11.123
Without calling me?

752
01:20:11.548 --> 01:20:12.428
In a hurry.

753
01:20:12.462 --> 01:20:15.419
Sam, he called when he had nothing.
Nothing but a dissatisfied feeling.

754
01:20:15.502 --> 01:20:17.907
Don't you think he'd have called
if he had anything at all?

755
01:20:19.923 --> 01:20:21.313
Yes, I think he would've.

756
01:20:22.050 --> 01:20:23.051
Let's go see Al Chambers.

757
01:20:23.135 --> 01:20:24.136
Who's he?

758
01:20:24.136 --> 01:20:25.618
Our deputy sheriff around here.

759
01:20:25.929 --> 01:20:27.173
All right. Let me get my coat.

760
01:20:35.981 --> 01:20:37.035
Good evening.

761
01:20:38.108 --> 01:20:41.987
Well, I don't know where to
start, except at the beginning.

762
01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:43.113
Yes.

763
01:20:44.387 --> 01:20:45.791
This is Lila Crane from Phoenix.

764
01:20:46.230 --> 01:20:47.171
How do you do?

765
01:20:47.434 --> 01:20:49.066
She's been here searching
for her sister.

766
01:20:49.637 --> 01:20:51.520
There's this private
detective helping and...

767
01:20:52.246 --> 01:20:54.059
Well, we got a call
from this detective

768
01:20:54.621 --> 01:20:56.877
saying that he'd traced her to
that motel out on the old highway.

769
01:20:56.909 --> 01:20:58.629
That must be the Bates Motel.

770
01:20:58.962 --> 01:21:01.723
He traced her there and called us to say
he was going to question Mrs. Bates.

771
01:21:02.043 --> 01:21:03.425
Norman took a wife?

772
01:21:03.660 --> 01:21:06.928
No, I don't think so.
An old woman. His mother.

773
01:21:07.723 --> 01:21:10.348
Well, anyway, that was early this evening.
We haven't seen or heard from him since.

774
01:21:10.629 --> 01:21:14.012
Now, your sister's
missing how long?

775
01:21:14.246 --> 01:21:17.137
Well, she left Phoenix a week
ago yesterday, without a trace.

776
01:21:17.488 --> 01:21:19.871
How'd you and this detective
come to trace her to Fairvale?

777
01:21:20.984 --> 01:21:22.456
They thought she'd be
coming to me.

778
01:21:23.323 --> 01:21:24.752
Left Phoenix under
her own steam?

779
01:21:24.777 --> 01:21:25.589
Yes.

780
01:21:25.614 --> 01:21:27.894
She's not missing so much
as she's run away.

781
01:21:28.402 --> 01:21:29.284
That's right.

782
01:21:29.644 --> 01:21:30.597
From what?

783
01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:34.869
She stole some money.

784
01:21:35.622 --> 01:21:36.650
A lot?

785
01:21:38.168 --> 01:21:39.419
$40,000.

786
01:21:40.114 --> 01:21:41.504
And the police
haven't been able to...

787
01:21:41.755 --> 01:21:45.161
Everyone concerned thought if they
could get her to give the money back,

788
01:21:45.609 --> 01:21:47.543
they could avoid involving
her with the police.

789
01:21:48.178 --> 01:21:51.215
That explains the private detective.
He traced her to the Bates place.

790
01:21:52.418 --> 01:21:54.512
What exactly did he say
when he called you?

791
01:21:54.793 --> 01:21:58.590
Well, he said that Marion was there
for one night and then she left.

792
01:21:58.793 --> 01:22:00.232
With the $40,000?

793
01:22:01.108 --> 01:22:02.739
Well, he didn't say
anything about the money.

794
01:22:03.426 --> 01:22:05.612
It isn't important what
he said on the phone, is it?

795
01:22:05.695 --> 01:22:07.417
He was supposed to come
back here and talk to us

796
01:22:07.442 --> 01:22:09.407
after he talked to the
mother, and he didn't.

797
01:22:09.645 --> 01:22:11.785
That's what I want you
to do something about.

798
01:22:11.868 --> 01:22:12.965
Like what?

799
01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:15.914
I'm sorry if I seem overanxious.

800
01:22:15.997 --> 01:22:19.306
It's just that I'm sure there's something
wrong out there and I have to know what.

801
01:22:19.793 --> 01:22:23.359
Well, I think there's something wrong
too, miss, but not the same thing.

802
01:22:23.384 --> 01:22:26.158
I think what's wrong is
your private detective.

803
01:22:26.666 --> 01:22:30.345
I think he got himself a hot lead
as to where your sister was going,

804
01:22:30.806 --> 01:22:32.705
probably from Norman Bates,

805
01:22:32.889 --> 01:22:37.060
and called you to keep you still while
he took off after her and the money.

806
01:22:37.144 --> 01:22:40.981
No, no, he said he was dissatisfied
and he was going back there.

807
01:22:41.064 --> 01:22:43.197
Why don't you call Norman and
let him say just what happened?

808
01:22:43.556 --> 01:22:44.860
At this hour?

809
01:22:44.943 --> 01:22:46.806
Well, he was out when I was
there just a while ago.

810
01:22:47.154 --> 01:22:49.156
If he's back, he probably
isn't even in bed yet.

811
01:22:49.478 --> 01:22:51.148
He wasn't out when
you were there,

812
01:22:51.173 --> 01:22:54.202
he just wasn't answering the door in the
dead of night, like some people do.

813
01:22:54.227 --> 01:22:55.986
This fellow lives like a hermit.

814
01:22:56.705 --> 01:22:59.875
You must remember that bad business
out there about 10 years ago.

815
01:22:59.958 --> 01:23:02.080
Please. Call.

816
01:23:07.841 --> 01:23:12.012
Florrie, the Sheriff wants you to
connect him with the Bates Motel.

817
01:23:18.143 --> 01:23:20.687
Hello, Norman? Sheriff Chambers.

818
01:23:22.272 --> 01:23:24.149
I've been just fine, thanks.

819
01:23:24.149 --> 01:23:26.234
Listen, we got worries here.

820
01:23:26.985 --> 01:23:30.280
Yeah, have you had a fella
stop by there tonight...

821
01:23:31.448 --> 01:23:33.909
Well, this one wouldn't be
a customer, anyway.

822
01:23:33.992 --> 01:23:35.875
He's a private
detective, name of...

823
01:23:35.900 --> 01:23:36.953
Arbogast.

824
01:23:37.127 --> 01:23:38.496
Arbogast.

825
01:23:42.167 --> 01:23:43.627
And after he left?

826
01:23:46.254 --> 01:23:48.284
No, that's okay, Norman.

827
01:23:50.252 --> 01:23:53.553
This detective was there,
Norman told him about the girl,

828
01:23:53.637 --> 01:23:56.229
the detective thanked
him and he went away.

829
01:23:57.401 --> 01:24:00.221
And he didn't come back?
He didn't see the mother?

830
01:24:00.602 --> 01:24:03.048
Your detective told you he
couldn't come right back

831
01:24:03.073 --> 01:24:06.942
because he was going to question
Norman Bates' mother, right?

832
01:24:07.025 --> 01:24:07.854
Yes.

833
01:24:08.799 --> 01:24:11.712
Norman Bates' mother has
been dead and buried

834
01:24:11.737 --> 01:24:15.102
in Green Lawn Cemetery
for the past 10 years.

835
01:24:16.159 --> 01:24:19.907
I helped Norman pick out the dress
she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.

836
01:24:20.165 --> 01:24:21.688
It ain't only
local history, Sam.

837
01:24:21.713 --> 01:24:24.836
It's the only case of murder and
suicide on Fairvale ledgers.

838
01:24:25.774 --> 01:24:30.131
Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy
she was involved with

839
01:24:30.131 --> 01:24:32.032
when she found
out he was married.

840
01:24:32.532 --> 01:24:34.704
Then took a helping
of the same stuff herself.

841
01:24:35.637 --> 01:24:39.000
Strychnine. Ugly way to die.

842
01:24:39.557 --> 01:24:41.516
Norman found them dead together.

843
01:24:41.977 --> 01:24:43.353
In bed.

844
01:24:44.774 --> 01:24:47.274
You mean that old woman I saw sitting in
the window out there wasn't Bates' mother?

845
01:24:47.758 --> 01:24:48.950
Now, wait a minute, Sam.

846
01:24:49.297 --> 01:24:51.945
Are you sure you
saw an old woman?

847
01:24:52.028 --> 01:24:54.282
Yes! In the house
behind the motel!

848
01:24:54.586 --> 01:24:56.696
I called and pounded
but she just ignored me!

849
01:24:56.908 --> 01:24:59.290
You want to tell me you saw
Norman Bates' mother?

850
01:24:59.860 --> 01:25:02.998
But it had to be because
Arbogast said so, too!

851
01:25:03.498 --> 01:25:06.477
And the young man wouldn't let him
see her because she was too ill.

852
01:25:06.915 --> 01:25:09.587
Well, if the woman up
there is Mrs. Bates,

853
01:25:11.006 --> 01:25:14.438
who's that woman buried out
in Green Lawn Cemetery?

854
01:25:57.602 --> 01:26:01.437
Now, Mother, I'm gonna
bring something up...

855
01:26:02.682 --> 01:26:04.139
I am sorry, boy,

856
01:26:04.164 --> 01:26:07.547
but you do manage to look ludicrous
when you give me orders.

857
01:26:07.867 --> 01:26:09.031
Please, Mother.

858
01:26:09.547 --> 01:26:12.317
No! I will not
hide in the fruit cellar.

859
01:26:13.818 --> 01:26:15.437
You think I'm fruity, huh?

860
01:26:16.234 --> 01:26:18.156
I'm staying right here.

861
01:26:18.429 --> 01:26:21.117
This is my room and no one
will drag me out of it,

862
01:26:21.383 --> 01:26:24.078
least of all my big, bold son.

863
01:26:24.398 --> 01:26:25.413
They'll come now, Mother.

864
01:26:25.504 --> 01:26:28.577
He came after the girl, and now
someone will come after him.

865
01:26:29.601 --> 01:26:31.483
Mother, please, it's
just for a few days.

866
01:26:31.508 --> 01:26:33.461
Just for a few days
so they won't find you.

867
01:26:33.922 --> 01:26:35.840
Just for a few days?

868
01:26:36.219 --> 01:26:39.344
In that dark, dank
fruit cellar? No!

869
01:26:40.136 --> 01:26:43.348
You hid me there once, boy, and you
won't do it again, not ever again!

870
01:26:43.431 --> 01:26:44.719
Now get out!

871
01:26:46.559 --> 01:26:48.515
I told you to get out, boy.

872
01:26:48.804 --> 01:26:50.133
I'll carry you, Mother.

873
01:26:50.500 --> 01:26:53.117
Norman, what do
you think you're doing?

874
01:26:53.594 --> 01:26:56.694
Don't you touch me!
Don't! Norman!

875
01:27:02.242 --> 01:27:05.851
Put me down! Put me down!
I can walk on my own.

876
01:27:13.836 --> 01:27:14.963
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

877
01:27:15.046 --> 01:27:16.219
Good morning.

878
01:27:16.589 --> 01:27:19.008
We thought if you didn't mind, we'd
drive out to that motel with you.

879
01:27:19.050 --> 01:27:20.093
He's already been.

880
01:27:20.135 --> 01:27:21.177
Went out before service.

881
01:27:21.383 --> 01:27:22.470
Did you two have breakfast?

882
01:27:22.914 --> 01:27:23.930
You didn't find anything?

883
01:27:24.101 --> 01:27:26.726
Nothing. Let's clear
the way here.

884
01:27:27.789 --> 01:27:29.742
Well, what did he say
about my sister?

885
01:27:30.281 --> 01:27:33.314
Just what he told your
detective, she used a fake name.

886
01:27:33.578 --> 01:27:34.691
Saw the register myself.

887
01:27:34.774 --> 01:27:37.694
Saw the whole place, as a matter of fact.
That boy's alone there.

888
01:27:37.914 --> 01:27:38.773
No mother?

889
01:27:38.798 --> 01:27:40.578
You must have seen
an illusion, Sam.

890
01:27:40.864 --> 01:27:43.570
I know you're not the
seeing-illusions type,

891
01:27:43.922 --> 01:27:46.202
but no woman was there and
I don't believe in ghosts,

892
01:27:46.286 --> 01:27:48.217
- ...so there it is.
- I still feel that there's something...

893
01:27:48.242 --> 01:27:51.344
Can see you do. I'm sorry I
couldn't make you feel better.

894
01:27:51.945 --> 01:27:53.793
You want to come around
to my office this afternoon

895
01:27:53.835 --> 01:27:56.711
and report a missing person and a
theft, that's what you want to do.

896
01:27:57.148 --> 01:27:59.090
The sooner you drop this
in the lap of the law,

897
01:27:59.132 --> 01:28:02.164
that's the sooner you stand a chance
of your sister being picked up.

898
01:28:03.094 --> 01:28:04.398
How about that?

899
01:28:05.138 --> 01:28:06.172
I don't know.

900
01:28:06.562 --> 01:28:07.599
It's Sunday.

901
01:28:08.265 --> 01:28:10.852
Come on over to the house and do
your reporting around dinnertime.

902
01:28:10.935 --> 01:28:12.281
It'll make it nicer.

903
01:28:13.273 --> 01:28:14.564
You too, Sam.

904
01:28:15.014 --> 01:28:16.070
Thank you.

905
01:28:18.109 --> 01:28:20.523
Maybe I am the
seeing-illusions type.

906
01:28:20.898 --> 01:28:22.008
No, you're not.

907
01:28:23.016 --> 01:28:24.768
Well, you want me to
drop you at the hotel or...

908
01:28:24.809 --> 01:28:25.852
Sam.

909
01:28:25.992 --> 01:28:28.344
I still won't feel satisfied
until I go out there.

910
01:28:30.575 --> 01:28:32.257
Neither will I. Come on.

911
01:28:33.833 --> 01:28:36.437
We better decide what we're gonna
say or do when we walk in there.

912
01:28:38.129 --> 01:28:40.094
We're going to register
as man and wife.

913
01:28:40.423 --> 01:28:42.929
We're going to get
shown to a cabin,

914
01:28:43.633 --> 01:28:48.350
{\fad(0,1000)}and then we're going to search every
inch of the place, inside and out.

915
01:29:11.294 --> 01:29:13.169
I wonder where Norman Bates
does his hermiting.

916
01:29:13.349 --> 01:29:15.750
Someone's at that window.
I just saw the curtain move.

917
01:29:15.833 --> 01:29:16.826
Come on.

918
01:29:20.004 --> 01:29:20.912
Well?

919
01:29:21.185 --> 01:29:22.451
Just coming up to ring for you.

920
01:29:23.758 --> 01:29:24.888
Suppose you want a room.

921
01:29:25.068 --> 01:29:27.011
We were gonna try to make it
straight to San Francisco,

922
01:29:27.053 --> 01:29:29.097
but we don't like
the look of that sky.

923
01:29:29.287 --> 01:29:30.598
Looks like a bad day
coming, doesn't it?

924
01:29:31.404 --> 01:29:32.318
Okay.

925
01:29:39.107 --> 01:29:40.233
I'll take you to Cabin 10.

926
01:29:40.316 --> 01:29:41.734
Better sign in first, hadn't we?

927
01:29:41.818 --> 01:29:43.091
No. That's not necessary.

928
01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:47.450
My boss is paying for this trip
and, well, it's 90% business.

929
01:29:47.949 --> 01:29:50.286
He wants practically
notarized receipts.

930
01:29:50.743 --> 01:29:52.544
I'd better sign in
and get a receipt.

931
01:30:11.097 --> 01:30:12.348
Thank you.

932
01:30:16.253 --> 01:30:17.401
- I'll get your bags.
- Haven't any.

933
01:30:21.286 --> 01:30:22.525
I'll show you the room, then.

934
01:30:22.609 --> 01:30:24.075
First time I've ever
seen it happen.

935
01:30:24.505 --> 01:30:26.161
You check in any other place
in this country without bags

936
01:30:26.186 --> 01:30:27.700
and you have to pay in advance.

937
01:30:28.567 --> 01:30:29.411
$10.

938
01:30:37.378 --> 01:30:38.535
That receipt.

939
01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:46.082
I'll go on ahead.

940
01:30:52.275 --> 01:30:54.947
All right, there's your receipt.
Now, I'll show you the cabin.

941
01:30:55.635 --> 01:30:57.408
Don't bother yourself.
We'll find it.

942
01:31:16.788 --> 01:31:18.763
Sam, we have to go into
that cabin and search it,

943
01:31:18.788 --> 01:31:21.397
no matter what we're afraid of
finding or how much it may hurt.

944
01:31:22.170 --> 01:31:23.053
I know.

945
01:31:24.087 --> 01:31:25.694
Do you think if something
happened, it happened there?

946
01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:27.053
I don't know.

947
01:31:27.741 --> 01:31:30.247
But if you had a useless
business like this motel,

948
01:31:30.272 --> 01:31:31.544
what would you need to get out?

949
01:31:31.569 --> 01:31:33.319
To get a new business
somewhere else?

950
01:31:33.638 --> 01:31:35.038
$40,000?

951
01:31:37.780 --> 01:31:39.327
How could we prove that...

952
01:31:39.977 --> 01:31:42.480
Well, if he opens a motel on the
new highway in, say, a year...

953
01:31:42.563 --> 01:31:44.967
There must be some
proof that exists now,

954
01:31:45.248 --> 01:31:48.397
something that proves he got that
money away from Marion somehow.

955
01:31:48.803 --> 01:31:50.116
What makes you sound so certain?

956
01:31:50.397 --> 01:31:53.014
Arbogast. He liked me, Sam.

957
01:31:53.408 --> 01:31:56.975
Or he felt sorry for me and he was
beginning to feel the same way about you.

958
01:31:57.225 --> 01:31:59.831
I could tell the last time
I talked to him on the phone.

959
01:31:59.872 --> 01:32:01.231
He wouldn't have gone anywhere

960
01:32:01.256 --> 01:32:03.967
or done anything without telling
us, unless he was stopped.

961
01:32:04.186 --> 01:32:07.842
And he was stopped. So he must
have found out something.

962
01:32:10.288 --> 01:32:11.772
We'll start with Cabin One.

963
01:32:14.702 --> 01:32:17.640
If he sees us, we're
just taking the air.

964
01:32:49.698 --> 01:32:51.143
Bates.

965
01:33:41.377 --> 01:33:43.260
- No shower curtain.
- Sam!

966
01:33:43.869 --> 01:33:44.811
- Look!
- What is it?

967
01:33:45.041 --> 01:33:47.146
It's figuring. It didn't
get washed down. Look.

968
01:33:47.188 --> 01:33:51.150
Some figure has been added to
or subtracted from 40,000.

969
01:33:51.150 --> 01:33:52.360
That proves Marion was here.

970
01:33:52.443 --> 01:33:53.541
It'd be too wild
a coincidence...

971
01:33:53.566 --> 01:33:54.978
Bates never denied she was here.

972
01:33:57.010 --> 01:33:58.950
Well, doesn't that prove that
he found out about the money?

973
01:33:58.991 --> 01:34:00.618
Do we simply ask him
where he's hidden it?

974
01:34:00.701 --> 01:34:01.744
No.

975
01:34:01.828 --> 01:34:04.846
But that old woman, whoever she
is, she told Arbogast something.

976
01:34:05.361 --> 01:34:07.244
I want her to tell us
the same thing.

977
01:34:08.647 --> 01:34:09.773
You can't go up there.

978
01:34:10.307 --> 01:34:11.253
Why not?

979
01:34:11.424 --> 01:34:13.336
- Bates.
- Well, let's find him.

980
01:34:13.361 --> 01:34:16.050
One of us can keep him occupied while
the other gets to the old woman.

981
01:34:16.133 --> 01:34:18.767
You'll never be able to hold him
still if he doesn't want to be held.

982
01:34:19.267 --> 01:34:21.013
I don't like you going
into that house alone.

983
01:34:21.097 --> 01:34:22.885
I can handle a sick old woman.

984
01:34:24.502 --> 01:34:26.486
All right, I'll find Bates
and keep him occupied.

985
01:34:28.346 --> 01:34:29.471
Wait a minute.

986
01:34:30.398 --> 01:34:32.080
If you get anything
out of the mother,

987
01:34:33.818 --> 01:34:35.322
can you find your
way back to town?

988
01:34:36.112 --> 01:34:37.502
Yes, of course.

989
01:34:38.463 --> 01:34:41.576
If you do get anything,
don't stop to tell me.

990
01:35:04.647 --> 01:35:05.850
You looking for me?

991
01:35:06.142 --> 01:35:07.319
Why, yes, as a matter of fact.

992
01:35:07.788 --> 01:35:09.272
Wife's taking a nap and...

993
01:35:09.686 --> 01:35:11.288
I never can keep quiet
enough for her,

994
01:35:12.100 --> 01:35:13.399
so I just thought I'd
look you up and talk.

995
01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:15.735
Good. You satisfied
with your cabin?

996
01:35:15.999 --> 01:35:17.233
Oh, it's fine.

997
01:36:31.602 --> 01:36:33.602
I've been doing all the
talking so far, haven't I?

998
01:36:34.648 --> 01:36:36.459
I thought it was the people who
were alone most of the time

999
01:36:36.484 --> 01:36:38.297
who did all the talking
when they got the chance.

1000
01:36:38.776 --> 01:36:40.312
Here you are doing
all the listening.

1001
01:36:41.070 --> 01:36:42.508
You are alone here, aren't you?

1002
01:36:43.364 --> 01:36:44.836
Drive me crazy.

1003
01:36:46.367 --> 01:36:49.062
I think that would be a rather
extreme reaction, don't you?

1004
01:36:49.273 --> 01:36:50.578
Just an expression.

1005
01:36:50.830 --> 01:36:54.055
What I meant was I'd do just
about anything to get away.

1006
01:36:54.492 --> 01:36:56.127
- Wouldn't you?
- No.

1007
01:37:02.484 --> 01:37:03.634
Mrs. Bates?

1008
01:38:20.628 --> 01:38:23.089
I'm not saying you shouldn't
be contented here,

1009
01:38:23.089 --> 01:38:24.635
I'm just doubting that you are.

1010
01:38:25.253 --> 01:38:28.479
I think if you saw a chance to get out
from under, you'd unload this place.

1011
01:38:28.886 --> 01:38:32.098
This place? This place
happens to be my only world.

1012
01:38:33.198 --> 01:38:36.370
I grew up in that house up there.
I had a very happy childhood.

1013
01:38:36.737 --> 01:38:38.448
My mother and I were
more than happy.

1014
01:39:40.207 --> 01:39:42.710
You look frightened. Have I been
saying something frightening?

1015
01:39:42.793 --> 01:39:44.211
I don't know what
you've been saying.

1016
01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:47.457
I've been talking about your
mother, about your motel.

1017
01:39:47.832 --> 01:39:48.799
How you gonna do it?

1018
01:39:49.214 --> 01:39:50.128
Do what?

1019
01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:52.925
Buy a new one in a new town where
you won't have to hide your mother.

1020
01:39:53.095 --> 01:39:55.511
Why don't you just get in your car
and drive away from here, okay?

1021
01:39:55.931 --> 01:39:57.753
Where will you get
the money to do that, Bates?

1022
01:39:57.975 --> 01:39:59.935
Or do you already
have it socked away?

1023
01:40:00.019 --> 01:40:01.020
Shut up!

1024
01:40:01.103 --> 01:40:02.855
A lot of it. $40,000.

1025
01:40:06.567 --> 01:40:09.667
I bet your mother knows where the
money is and what you did to get it.

1026
01:40:10.238 --> 01:40:11.824
I think she'll tell us.

1027
01:40:14.033 --> 01:40:17.800
Where's that girl you came
here with? Where is she?

1028
01:41:22.426 --> 01:41:23.894
Mrs. Bates...

1029
01:41:43.927 --> 01:41:45.874
I am Norma Bates!

1030
01:42:17.114 --> 01:42:20.004
If anyone gets any answers
it'll be the psychiatrist.

1031
01:42:20.426 --> 01:42:22.793
Even I couldn't get to
Norman and he knows me.

1032
01:42:23.153 --> 01:42:24.684
- You warm enough, miss?
- Yes.

1033
01:42:26.449 --> 01:42:27.707
Did he talk to you?

1034
01:42:29.188 --> 01:42:30.231
No.

1035
01:42:32.129 --> 01:42:37.301
I got the whole story, but not from Norman.
I got it from his mother.

1036
01:42:38.594 --> 01:42:41.096
Norman Bates no longer exists.

1037
01:42:42.097 --> 01:42:44.384
He only half-existed
to begin with.

1038
01:42:44.907 --> 01:42:47.923
And now the other
half has taken over,

1039
01:42:49.243 --> 01:42:51.602
probably for all time.

1040
01:42:53.431 --> 01:42:55.040
Did he kill my sister?

1041
01:42:55.360 --> 01:42:56.977
Yes.

1042
01:42:57.662 --> 01:42:58.788
And no.

1043
01:42:58.947 --> 01:43:02.117
Well, now look, if you're trying
to lay some psychiatric groundwork

1044
01:43:02.117 --> 01:43:04.562
for some sort of plea, this
fellow would like to cop...

1045
01:43:04.587 --> 01:43:07.079
A psychiatrist doesn't
lay the groundwork.

1046
01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:09.708
He merely tries to explain it.

1047
01:43:10.209 --> 01:43:12.503
- But my sister is...
- Yes.

1048
01:43:15.501 --> 01:43:17.549
Yes, I'm sorry.

1049
01:43:18.592 --> 01:43:20.376
The private investigator, too.

1050
01:43:20.401 --> 01:43:23.977
If you drag that swamp somewhere in
the vicinity of the motel, you'll...

1051
01:43:28.481 --> 01:43:31.153
Have you any unsolved missing
persons cases on your books?

1052
01:43:31.747 --> 01:43:33.165
Yes, two.

1053
01:43:33.190 --> 01:43:34.400
Young girls?

1054
01:43:35.109 --> 01:43:36.110
Did he confess to...

1055
01:43:36.110 --> 01:43:38.403
Like I said, the mother.

1056
01:43:41.106 --> 01:43:44.785
Now, to understand it the way I understood
it, hearing it from the mother,

1057
01:43:45.247 --> 01:43:48.330
that is, from the mother
half of Norman's mind,

1058
01:43:49.081 --> 01:43:51.161
you have to go back 10 years

1059
01:43:51.959 --> 01:43:54.630
to the time when Norman murdered
his mother and her lover.

1060
01:43:55.380 --> 01:43:57.756
Now, he was already
dangerously disturbed,

1061
01:43:57.966 --> 01:44:00.092
had been ever
since his father died.

1062
01:44:01.247 --> 01:44:04.896
His mother was a clinging,
demanding woman,

1063
01:44:06.372 --> 01:44:10.099
and for years the two of them lived as
if there was no one else in the world.

1064
01:44:11.591 --> 01:44:13.147
Then she met a man,

1065
01:44:13.772 --> 01:44:17.458
and it seemed to Norman that she
threw him over for this man.

1066
01:44:18.402 --> 01:44:20.536
Now, that pushed him over the
line and he killed them both.

1067
01:44:22.823 --> 01:44:26.493
Matricide is probably the most
unbearable crime of all,

1068
01:44:28.078 --> 01:44:30.474
most unbearable to
the son who commits it.

1069
01:44:31.999 --> 01:44:36.670
So he had to erase the crime,
at least in his own mind.

1070
01:44:39.715 --> 01:44:40.927
He stole her corpse.

1071
01:44:44.094 --> 01:44:46.177
A weighted coffin was buried.

1072
01:44:47.177 --> 01:44:49.278
He hid the body
in the fruit cellar,

1073
01:44:50.161 --> 01:44:52.614
even treated it to keep it
as well as it would keep.

1074
01:44:53.278 --> 01:44:55.060
And that still wasn't enough.

1075
01:44:56.106 --> 01:44:59.860
She was there,
but she was a corpse.

1076
01:45:02.411 --> 01:45:05.115
So he began to think
and speak for her,

1077
01:45:05.115 --> 01:45:07.489
give her half his life,
so to speak.

1078
01:45:08.327 --> 01:45:12.331
At times he could be both
personalities, carry on conversations.

1079
01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:17.085
At other times, the mother
half took over completely.

1080
01:45:17.505 --> 01:45:22.174
He was never all Norman,
but he was often only Mother,

1081
01:45:23.675 --> 01:45:26.872
and because he was so
pathologically jealous of her,

1082
01:45:27.471 --> 01:45:29.677
he assumed that she was
as jealous of him.

1083
01:45:30.169 --> 01:45:34.645
Therefore, if he felt a strong
attraction to any other woman,

1084
01:45:35.646 --> 01:45:37.700
the mother side of
him would go wild.

1085
01:45:41.652 --> 01:45:43.552
When he met your sister,

1086
01:45:45.113 --> 01:45:47.480
he was touched by her,
aroused by her.

1087
01:45:47.505 --> 01:45:48.474
He wanted her.

1088
01:45:51.078 --> 01:45:54.294
That set off the jealous mother,
and Mother killed the girl.

1089
01:45:56.750 --> 01:46:00.420
After the murder, Norman returned
as if from a deep sleep,

1090
01:46:01.088 --> 01:46:05.092
and, like a dutiful son, covered
up all traces of the crime

1091
01:46:05.092 --> 01:46:07.489
he was convinced
his mother had committed!

1092
01:46:07.903 --> 01:46:10.044
Why was he dressed like that?

1093
01:46:10.556 --> 01:46:11.958
He's a transvestite.

1094
01:46:13.505 --> 01:46:14.810
Not exactly.

1095
01:46:15.519 --> 01:46:19.214
A man who dresses in women's clothing
in order to achieve a sexual change

1096
01:46:19.239 --> 01:46:21.567
or satisfaction is
a transvestite.

1097
01:46:21.650 --> 01:46:26.253
But in Norman's case, he was
simply doing everything possible

1098
01:46:26.278 --> 01:46:29.310
to keep alive the illusion
of his mother being alive.

1099
01:46:31.076 --> 01:46:33.114
And when reality came too close,

1100
01:46:33.662 --> 01:46:37.124
when danger or desire
threatened that illusion,

1101
01:46:39.661 --> 01:46:42.520
he'd dress up, even to
a cheap wig he bought.

1102
01:46:42.796 --> 01:46:46.380
He'd walk about the house, sit in
her chair, speak in her voice.

1103
01:46:47.009 --> 01:46:49.208
He tried to be his mother.

1104
01:46:51.096 --> 01:46:53.942
And now he is.

1105
01:46:55.642 --> 01:46:58.974
That's what I meant when I said I
got the story from the mother.

1106
01:46:59.177 --> 01:47:02.149
You see, when the mind
houses two personalities,

1107
01:47:02.899 --> 01:47:05.402
there's always a
conflict, a battle.

1108
01:47:06.489 --> 01:47:09.156
In Norman's case,
the battle is over,

1109
01:47:10.216 --> 01:47:12.492
and the dominant
personality has won.

1110
01:47:12.755 --> 01:47:15.497
And the $40,000? Who got that?

1111
01:47:16.622 --> 01:47:20.167
The swamp. These were crimes
of passion, not profit.

1112
01:47:22.302 --> 01:47:25.052
He feels a little chill. Can
I bring him this blanket?

1113
01:47:26.214 --> 01:47:28.349
- Oh, sure.
- All right.

1114
01:47:40.765 --> 01:47:41.843
Thank you.

1115
01:47:49.765 --> 01:47:52.949
<i>It's sad when a
mother has to speak the words</i>

1116
01:47:53.033 --> 01:47:54.834
<i>that condemn her own son,</i>

1117
01:47:55.264 --> 01:47:58.537
<i>but I couldn't allow them to believe
that I would commit murder.</i>

1118
01:47:59.139 --> 01:48:02.834
<i>They'll put him away now,
as I should have years ago.</i>

1119
01:48:03.502 --> 01:48:05.546
<i>He was always bad,</i>

1120
01:48:05.754 --> 01:48:10.655
<i>and in the end he intended to tell them
I killed those girls and that man,</i>

1121
01:48:11.006 --> 01:48:14.596
<i>as if I could do anything
except just sit and stare,</i>

1122
01:48:14.819 --> 01:48:17.099
<i>like one of his stuffed birds.</i>

1123
01:48:17.974 --> 01:48:21.311
<i>They know I can't even
move a finger, and I won't.</i>

1124
01:48:21.530 --> 01:48:27.067
<i>I'll just sit here and be quiet,
just in case they do suspect me.</i>

1125
01:48:30.070 --> 01:48:33.240
<i>They're probably watching me.
Well, let them.</i>

1126
01:48:33.949 --> 01:48:36.743
<i>Let them see what kind
of a person I am.</i>

1127
01:48:37.941 --> 01:48:40.281
<i>I'm not even gonna
swat that fly.</i>

1128
01:48:40.306 --> 01:48:43.083
<i>I hope they are watching.
They'll see.</i>

1129
01:48:43.709 --> 01:48:45.335
<i>They'll see and they'll know,</i>

1130
01:48:45.419 --> 01:48:50.585
<i>and they'll say, "Why, she
wouldn't even harm a fly."</i>
