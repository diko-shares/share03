1
00:03:34.171 --> 00:03:38.091
Mod fx squared, dx.

2
00:03:39.927 --> 00:03:43.472
So please finish Percival by next time.

3
00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:46.934
I know many of you had this as undergraduates,
but it won't hurt to brush up.

4
00:03:51.355 --> 00:03:52.898
Thank you, Steven.

5
00:03:54.608 --> 00:03:59.108
I also put an advanced Fourier system
on the main hallway chalkboard.

6
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.324
I'm hoping that one of you
might prove it by the end of the semester.

7
00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:05.369
Now the person to do so will
not only be in my good graces...

8
00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:08.581
but also go on to fame and fortune...

9
00:04:08.664 --> 00:04:11.708
by having their accomplishment recorded
and their name printed...

10
00:04:11.792 --> 00:04:13.835
in the auspicious <i>M.I.T. Tech.</i>

11
00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:18.419
Former winners include Nobel laureates,
Field's medal winners...

12
00:04:18.507 --> 00:04:22.802
renowned astrophysicists
and lowly M.I.T. professors.

13
00:04:23.345 --> 00:04:26.681
That's all.
If you have any questions...

14
00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:29.268
I'm sure that Tom has the answers.

15
00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.639
Hi, Will.

16
00:05:07.723 --> 00:05:09.725
- Kirsten, how you doing?
- I'm all right. How are you?

17
00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:13.020
- Good.
- I didn't get on Cathy last night.

18
00:05:14.313 --> 00:05:15.772
- Why not?
- I don't know.

19
00:05:15.856 --> 00:05:18.149
- Cathy!
- What?

20
00:05:18.234 --> 00:05:22.196
Why didn't you give me none of that nasty
little hoochie-woochie you usually throw at me?

21
00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:25.573
Oh, fuck you
and your Irish curse, Chuckie.

22
00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:29.578
Like I'd waste my energy spreadin' my legs
for that Tootsie Roll dick?

23
00:05:29.662 --> 00:05:33.040
- Go home and give it a tug yourself.
- Tootsie Roll!

24
00:05:33.123 --> 00:05:35.083
Toots!

25
00:05:35.167 --> 00:05:37.544
She's missin' a tooth, Will.

26
00:05:38.546 --> 00:05:41.340
She's got skin problems. I don't—

27
00:05:41.423 --> 00:05:44.467
Plus, it's like 5-to-2 Morgan ends up
marryin' her, you know what I mean?

28
00:05:44.552 --> 00:05:47.304
There's only so many times
you can bang your friend's future wife.

29
00:05:47.388 --> 00:05:49.932
It's wrong. Where you goin'?

30
00:05:50.015 --> 00:05:51.725
I'm gonna take off.

31
00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:54.520
Fuck you, you're takin' off.
It's, like, what, 10:00?

32
00:05:54.603 --> 00:05:56.855
No, I'm tired.

33
00:05:59.149 --> 00:06:01.067
Irish curse?

34
00:06:01.151 --> 00:06:04.028
She don't know.
There ain't no Irish curse.

35
00:07:12.806 --> 00:07:14.307
Stop brushing me back.

36
00:07:14.391 --> 00:07:18.603
Stop crowding the plate!
Which one will it be?

37
00:07:21.065 --> 00:07:22.900
You're gonna get charged, you know that?

38
00:07:22.983 --> 00:07:26.861
You think I'm afraid of you, you big fuck?
You're crowdin' the fuckin' plate.

39
00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:31.446
Hey, Casey's bouncin' up a bar at
Harvard next week. We should go up there.

40
00:07:31.575 --> 00:07:33.702
- What are we gonna do up there?
- I don't know.

41
00:07:33.786 --> 00:07:37.790
We'll fuck up some smart kids.
Probably fit right in.

42
00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:42.377
Ow! Fuckin' punk.

43
00:07:43.337 --> 00:07:46.715
- Oh, what's up? You still tough?
- Come on!

44
00:07:46.799 --> 00:07:48.675
Come on. Come on. That's it.

45
00:07:50.386 --> 00:07:54.886
I'd hold you forever here

46
00:07:55.557 --> 00:07:59.185
In my arms

47
00:07:59.269 --> 00:08:01.187
- Professor Lambeau?
- Yes?

48
00:08:01.271 --> 00:08:04.857
I'm in your applied theories class.
We're all up at the math and science building.

49
00:08:04.942 --> 00:08:08.820
Come here. It's Saturday.

50
00:08:08.904 --> 00:08:12.365
- Unless you wanna have a drink with me.
- Maybe.

51
00:08:12.449 --> 00:08:14.534
We just couldn't wait
until Monday to find out.

52
00:08:14.618 --> 00:08:17.495
- Find out what?
- Who proved the theorem.

53
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:44.147
This is correct. Who did this?

54
00:08:44.231 --> 00:08:46.524
- Jack?
- It wasn’t me.

55
00:08:46.608 --> 00:08:49.277
- Nemesh?
- No way.

56
00:08:53.365 --> 00:08:56.117
- Come on, Joey Mac!
- Billy, McNamara's up.

57
00:08:56.201 --> 00:08:58.620
Come on, kid!

58
00:08:58.704 --> 00:09:00.914
- Joey, dig it out! Dig it out!
- Another pitch!

59
00:09:00.998 --> 00:09:02.833
Bring it down, Mac! That's how to do it!

60
00:09:02.916 --> 00:09:04.584
Attaboy! Take two, Mac.

61
00:09:08.589 --> 00:09:12.092
Hey, Morgan, who's the girl with
the striped pants? She's got a nice ass.

62
00:09:12.176 --> 00:09:15.137
- Yeah, that's a real nice ass.
- Who's the guy she's with?

63
00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:18.514
That fuckin' guinea.
I hate that little bitch. Will knows him.

64
00:09:18.599 --> 00:09:21.226
Yeah, I do. Yeah, fuckin'
Carmine Scarpaglia.

65
00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:23.478
That guy used to beat the shit
out of me in kindergarten.

66
00:09:23.562 --> 00:09:25.272
- That guy?
- Yeah.

67
00:09:26.607 --> 00:09:29.192
Fuck this. Let's get some food.

68
00:09:29.276 --> 00:09:33.029
- What, Morgan, you're not gonna go talk to her?
- Fuck her.

69
00:09:33.113 --> 00:09:35.865
- I could go for a Whopper.
- Let's go to Kelly's.

70
00:09:35.949 --> 00:09:38.826
Morgan, I'm not goin' to Kelly's
just 'cause you like the take-out girl.

71
00:09:38.911 --> 00:09:40.704
It's 15 minutes out of our way.

72
00:09:40.788 --> 00:09:43.332
What the fuck are we gonna do?
We can't spare 15 minutes?

73
00:09:45.876 --> 00:09:47.794
Double burger.

74
00:09:49.379 --> 00:09:51.422
Double burger.

75
00:09:52.466 --> 00:09:54.426
Chuck, I had a double burger.

76
00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:57.638
Would you shut the fuck up?
I know what you ordered. I was there.

77
00:09:57.721 --> 00:09:58.972
So give me my fuckin' sandwich.

78
00:09:59.056 --> 00:10:00.724
What do you mean, your sandwich?
I bought it.

79
00:10:00.808 --> 00:10:02.601
Morgan, how much money you got on you?

80
00:10:02.684 --> 00:10:05.478
I said I'd get change
when I get the snow cone.

81
00:10:05.562 --> 00:10:08.982
I said that when we pulled up.
Give me my sandwich and stop bein' a prick.

82
00:10:09.066 --> 00:10:12.194
All right, give me your fuckin'
16 cents that you got on you now.

83
00:10:12.277 --> 00:10:16.656
We'll put your fuckin' sandwich on layaway.
Here we go. Keep it right up here for ya.

84
00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:19.367
We'll put you on a program.
Every day you come in with your six cents.

85
00:10:19.451 --> 00:10:21.077
At the end of the week,
you get your sandwich.

86
00:10:21.161 --> 00:10:24.414
- Are you gonna be an asshole?
- What am I, fuckin' sandwich welfare?

87
00:10:24.498 --> 00:10:26.875
I think you should establish
a good line of credit.

88
00:10:26.959 --> 00:10:29.753
Like how you bought your couch—
payment plans.

89
00:10:29.837 --> 00:10:33.090
Remember how your mother
brought in ten dollars every day for a year.

90
00:10:33.173 --> 00:10:35.049
She finally got her couch
Rent-A-Center style.

91
00:10:35.134 --> 00:10:38.470
- Can I have my food, please?
- Here's your fuckin' double burger.

92
00:10:41.598 --> 00:10:45.059
- Hey, hold up, Chuck. Slow it down.
- Who do we got?

93
00:10:45.144 --> 00:10:47.104
- I don't know yet.
- Hey, douche bag!

94
00:10:47.187 --> 00:10:49.689
Yeah, you, you skank face!

95
00:10:49.773 --> 00:10:51.691
- Shut the fuck up.
- Get outta here.

96
00:10:51.775 --> 00:10:53.193
What are you worried about?

97
00:10:53.277 --> 00:10:56.280
- Come on, Will.
- Why don't you lick my love stick?

98
00:10:56.363 --> 00:10:59.616
We seen the guy 15 minutes ago.
We should've fight him then.

99
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.368
We're eatin' our snacks now.

100
00:11:01.451 --> 00:11:02.535
- Shut up, Morgan, you're goin'.
- I'm not goin'.

101
00:11:02.619 --> 00:11:03.494
So don't go.

102
00:11:03.579 --> 00:11:07.374
- I'm not goin'.
- Fuckin' go, Morgan.

103
00:11:07.457 --> 00:11:09.959
Let me tell you. If you're not
out there in two fuckin' seconds...

104
00:11:10.043 --> 00:11:11.836
when I'm done with them, you're next.

105
00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:16.049
Carmine, it's me, Will. Remember?
We went to kindergarten together.

106
00:11:30.314 --> 00:11:33.775
- Fuckin', let's go, man.
- Step on his fuckin' head.

107
00:11:33.859 --> 00:11:37.863
Smash his ass on the ground.
Stomp that motherfucker.

108
00:11:44.203 --> 00:11:46.246
- Motherfucker, die!
- Hit him harder!

109
00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:49.583
- Harder!
- Come on!

110
00:12:00.219 --> 00:12:04.598
Will! Will, cops, Will!

111
00:12:04.681 --> 00:12:08.101
Will, cops. Let's go. Let's go.

112
00:12:09.269 --> 00:12:10.186
Easy, brother, easy.

113
00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:14.770
- Hey, fellas, thanks for comin' out.
- Come here!

114
00:12:22.199 --> 00:12:23.742
Fuck.

115
00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:35.337
Is it just my imagination,
or has my class grown considerably?

116
00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:38.506
By no stretch of my imagination...

117
00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:41.175
do I believe you've all come here
to hear me lecture.

118
00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.805
Rather, to ascertain the identity
of the mystery math magician.

119
00:12:46.098 --> 00:12:50.598
So without further ado, come forward,
silent rogue, and receive thy prize.

120
00:13:02.197 --> 00:13:05.742
I'm sorry to disappoint my spectators, but...

121
00:13:05.826 --> 00:13:08.620
it seems there will be
no unmasking here today.

122
00:13:09.454 --> 00:13:12.415
However, my colleagues and I
have conferred...

123
00:13:12.499 --> 00:13:15.502
and there is a problem
on the board right now...

124
00:13:15.585 --> 00:13:17.837
that took us more than two years to prove.

125
00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:22.592
So let this be said:
The gauntlet has been thrown down...

126
00:13:22.676 --> 00:13:26.680
but the faculty have answered
and answered with vigor.

127
00:13:39.359 --> 00:13:42.695
- Hey, when's the arraignment?
- Next week.

128
00:14:10.057 --> 00:14:11.016
Sorry.

129
00:14:11.099 --> 00:14:13.101
- What are you doing?
- Sorry.

130
00:14:14.811 --> 00:14:17.104
That's people's work.
You can't graffiti here.

131
00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:19.983
- Don't you walk away from me!
- Hey, fuck you!

132
00:14:20.067 --> 00:14:23.070
You're a clever one. What's your name?

133
00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:47.427
Oh, my God.

134
00:14:54.142 --> 00:14:56.102
Looks right.

135
00:15:11.535 --> 00:15:14.829
Will, how retarded do you gotta be
to get fired from that job?

136
00:15:14.913 --> 00:15:17.624
How hard is it to push
a motherfuckin' broom around?

137
00:15:17.707 --> 00:15:19.709
Bitch, you got fired
from pushin' a fuckin' broom.

138
00:15:19.793 --> 00:15:22.170
I got fired 'cause management
was restructuring.

139
00:15:22.254 --> 00:15:24.965
Yeah, restructuring the amount of retards
they had workin' for 'em.

140
00:15:25.048 --> 00:15:27.050
Shut up. You get canned
more than tuna, bitch.

141
00:15:27.134 --> 00:15:29.386
At least I got a motherfuckin' job
right now, don't I?

142
00:15:29.469 --> 00:15:30.720
Yeah.

143
00:15:30.804 --> 00:15:33.890
- Why did you get fired, Will?
- Management was restructuring.

144
00:15:36.476 --> 00:15:38.269
My uncle could probably
get you on a demo team.

145
00:15:38.353 --> 00:15:39.604
- Can he do that?
- You kiddin' me?

146
00:15:39.688 --> 00:15:41.648
I asked you yesterday if I could get a job.

147
00:15:41.731 --> 00:15:44.900
- And I told you “no” yesterday.
- What's up, Casey?

148
00:15:44.985 --> 00:15:46.236
- What's up, Case?
- What's up, Big Case?

149
00:15:49.281 --> 00:15:51.199
Let's sit over here.

150
00:15:58.957 --> 00:16:02.377
This is a Harvard bar, huh?

151
00:16:02.461 --> 00:16:04.880
I thought there'd be
equations and shit on the walls.

152
00:16:06.923 --> 00:16:10.635
I will take a pitcher
of the finest lager in the house.

153
00:16:17.559 --> 00:16:21.729
Time out. I'm gonna have to bust a little move
on them Harvard honeys down the end of the bar.

154
00:16:21.813 --> 00:16:25.817
- Work some magic.
- Get some potion for us.

155
00:16:42.334 --> 00:16:43.793
- Oh, hello.
- Oh, hello.

156
00:16:43.877 --> 00:16:46.087
- Hi. How are ya?
- Fine.

157
00:16:46.171 --> 00:16:48.047
- So, do you ladies—
- Come here often?

158
00:16:48.131 --> 00:16:50.091
Do I come here? I come here a bit.

159
00:16:50.175 --> 00:16:53.178
I'm here, you know, from time to time.

160
00:16:53.261 --> 00:16:55.721
- Do you go to school here?
- Yep.

161
00:16:55.805 --> 00:17:00.305
- Yeah, that's it. I think I had a class with you.
- Oh, yeah. What class?

162
00:17:01.144 --> 00:17:03.062
- History.
- Maybe.

163
00:17:03.146 --> 00:17:05.064
Yes, I think that's what it was.

164
00:17:05.148 --> 00:17:08.818
You don't necessarily—
may not remember me. I like it here.

165
00:17:08.902 --> 00:17:11.487
It doesn't mean cause I go here,
I'm a genius. I am smart.

166
00:17:11.571 --> 00:17:12.905
Hey.

167
00:17:12.989 --> 00:17:14.782
- Hey, how's it goin'? How are ya?
- Good. How ya doin'?

168
00:17:14.866 --> 00:17:17.451
What class did you say that was?

169
00:17:17.536 --> 00:17:19.454
- History.
- Yeah.

170
00:17:19.538 --> 00:17:23.083
Just history?
It must have been a survey course then.

171
00:17:23.166 --> 00:17:25.168
- Yeah, it was. It was surveys.
- Right.

172
00:17:25.252 --> 00:17:27.504
You should check it out.
It's a good course. It'd be a good class.

173
00:17:27.587 --> 00:17:31.173
- How'd you like that course?
- You know, frankly...

174
00:17:31.258 --> 00:17:34.928
- I found that class rather elementary.
- Elementary.

175
00:17:35.011 --> 00:17:37.013
- I don't doubt that it was.
- Yeah.

176
00:17:37.097 --> 00:17:40.100
I remember that class.

177
00:17:40.183 --> 00:17:43.603
It was just between recess and lunch.

178
00:17:43.687 --> 00:17:46.189
Clark, why don't you go away?

179
00:17:46.273 --> 00:17:48.441
- Why don't you relax?
- Why don't you go away?

180
00:17:48.525 --> 00:17:51.528
- I'm just havin' fun with my new friend.
- Are we gonna have a problem?

181
00:17:51.611 --> 00:17:54.155
No, no, no. There's no problem here.

182
00:17:54.239 --> 00:17:57.700
I was just hoping you might
give me some insight into the evolution...

183
00:17:57.784 --> 00:18:00.953
of the market economy
in the southern colonies.

184
00:18:01.037 --> 00:18:05.537
My contention is that prior to
the Revolutionary War, the economic modalities—

185
00:18:06.585 --> 00:18:09.337
Especially in the southern colonies—

186
00:18:09.421 --> 00:18:12.006
Could most aptly be characterized as...

187
00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:14.050
- agrarian precapitalist.
- Let me tell you somethin'.

188
00:18:14.134 --> 00:18:16.427
Of course that's your contention.
You're a first-year grad student.

189
00:18:16.511 --> 00:18:20.056
You just got finished readin' some
Marxian historian— Pete Garrison, probably—

190
00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:22.851
You're gonna be convinced of that till
next month when you get to James Lemon.

191
00:18:22.934 --> 00:18:25.978
Then you're gonna be talkin' about how
the economies of Virginia and Pennsylvania...

192
00:18:26.062 --> 00:18:29.190
were entrepreneurial
and capitalist way back in 1740.

193
00:18:29.274 --> 00:18:32.652
That's gonna last until next year.
You're gonna be regurgitatin' Gordon Wood...

194
00:18:32.736 --> 00:18:35.780
talkin' about, you know,
the prerevolutionary utopia...

195
00:18:35.864 --> 00:18:38.867
and the capital-forming effects
of military mobilization.

196
00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:44.581
As a matter of fact, I won't, because Wood
drastically underestimates the impact of—

197
00:18:44.664 --> 00:18:48.084
Wood drastically underestimates
the impact of social distinctions...

198
00:18:48.168 --> 00:18:51.421
predicated upon wealth,
especially inherited wealth?

199
00:18:51.504 --> 00:18:55.716
You got that from Vickers'
<i>Work in Essex County</i>. Page 98, right?

200
00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.385
I read that too. Were you gonna plagiarize
the whole thing for us?

201
00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:02.056
Do you have any thoughts
of your own on this matter?

202
00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:05.268
Or is that your thing? You come into a bar.
You read some obscure passage.

203
00:19:05.352 --> 00:19:08.188
Then pretend— Pawn it off as your own—

204
00:19:08.271 --> 00:19:11.857
As your own idea just to impress some girls?
Embarrass my friend?

205
00:19:13.234 --> 00:19:15.611
See, the sad thing
about a guy like you is, in 50 years...

206
00:19:15.695 --> 00:19:17.613
you're gonna start doin'
some thinkin' on your own.

207
00:19:17.697 --> 00:19:20.408
You're gonna come up with the fact that
there are two certainties in life.

208
00:19:20.492 --> 00:19:22.160
One: Don't do that.

209
00:19:22.243 --> 00:19:25.287
And two: You dropped 150 grand
on a fuckin' education...

210
00:19:25.372 --> 00:19:28.375
you could've got for $1.50 in late charges
at the public library.

211
00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:33.171
Yeah, but I will have a degree...

212
00:19:33.254 --> 00:19:37.049
and you'll be servin' my kids fries at
a drive through on our way to a skiing trip.

213
00:19:38.593 --> 00:19:41.554
Maybe, but at least I won't be unoriginal.

214
00:19:42.931 --> 00:19:46.267
If you have a problem with that, we could
step outside. We could figure it out.

215
00:19:47.477 --> 00:19:51.272
No, man, there's no problem. It's cool.

216
00:19:51.356 --> 00:19:52.565
- It's cool?
- Yeah.

217
00:19:52.649 --> 00:19:55.610
- Cool.
- Damn right, it's cool.

218
00:19:55.694 --> 00:19:58.113
How do you like me now?

219
00:20:00.657 --> 00:20:02.533
My boy's wicked smart.

220
00:20:04.452 --> 00:20:07.371
You spend three minutes in this fuckin' place,
you run into a barney, huh?

221
00:20:09.416 --> 00:20:11.292
There it is.

222
00:20:11.376 --> 00:20:13.336
- Nice to meet you.
- They were fine, man.

223
00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:17.674
I was gonna close the deal,
but then Chuck— Billy insulted one of 'em—

224
00:20:17.757 --> 00:20:21.510
The heavyset girl said I had a receding hairline,
and I was a few pounds overweight.

225
00:20:21.594 --> 00:20:23.929
And I was, like, “Go fuck yourself.”

226
00:20:25.014 --> 00:20:26.932
I swallowed a bug.

227
00:20:28.935 --> 00:20:30.061
Hi.

228
00:20:30.145 --> 00:20:33.106
- You're an idiot.
- What?

229
00:20:33.189 --> 00:20:35.774
You're an idiot. I've been sitting
over there for 45 minutes...

230
00:20:35.859 --> 00:20:37.527
waiting for you to come and talk to me.

231
00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:39.903
But I'm tired now, and I have to go home.

232
00:20:39.988 --> 00:20:42.532
I couldn't sit there anymore
waiting for you.

233
00:20:42.615 --> 00:20:44.575
- I'm Will.
- Skylar.

234
00:20:44.659 --> 00:20:46.577
- Skylar.
- Oh, and by the way...

235
00:20:46.661 --> 00:20:49.955
that guy over there— Michael Bolton clone—

236
00:20:50.039 --> 00:20:51.999
He wasn't sitting with us, so to speak.

237
00:20:52.083 --> 00:20:55.377
- I know. I kinda got that impression.
- Good. Okay.

238
00:20:55.462 --> 00:20:57.422
Well, I've got to go.

239
00:20:57.505 --> 00:21:01.759
Gotta get up early and waste some more
money on my overpriced education.

240
00:21:01.843 --> 00:21:04.011
- No, I didn't mean you.
- That's all right.

241
00:21:04.095 --> 00:21:07.723
There's my number.
Maybe we can go out for coffee sometime.

242
00:21:07.807 --> 00:21:11.435
All right, yeah. Maybe we could just
get together and eat a bunch of caramels.

243
00:21:11.519 --> 00:21:13.437
- What do you mean?
- When you think about it...

244
00:21:13.521 --> 00:21:18.021
- it's as arbitrary as drinkin' coffee.
- Yeah. Okay.

245
00:21:18.443 --> 00:21:20.486
Right, then.

246
00:21:21.571 --> 00:21:25.157
Oh, come on. You're kidding.

247
00:21:28.536 --> 00:21:29.537
Yo!

248
00:21:29.621 --> 00:21:31.497
- Fuck you, bitch!
- Fuck you.

249
00:21:31.581 --> 00:21:34.792
There goes them fuckin' barneys
right now with his skiin' trip.

250
00:21:34.876 --> 00:21:37.253
- Hold up.
- We should've beat that old bitch's ass.

251
00:21:44.928 --> 00:21:47.013
Do you like apples?

252
00:21:48.306 --> 00:21:50.224
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

253
00:21:51.851 --> 00:21:55.396
I got her number!
How do you like them apples?

254
00:22:53.496 --> 00:22:56.499
Excuse me?
Is this the Buildings and Grounds office?

255
00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:59.835
Yeah. What can I do for you?

256
00:22:59.919 --> 00:23:01.962
I just need the name
of a student who works here.

257
00:23:02.046 --> 00:23:04.465
- No students work for me.
- Could you please check?

258
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:06.717
I have this guy who works in my building.

259
00:23:06.801 --> 00:23:08.427
- He's about this high.
- Which one is your building?

260
00:23:09.304 --> 00:23:12.265
- Two.
- Two. Building two.

261
00:23:18.021 --> 00:23:20.356
- If anything was stolen, I should know.
- No, it's nothing like that.

262
00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.650
I just need his name.

263
00:23:22.734 --> 00:23:25.611
I can't give you his name
unless you have a complaint.

264
00:23:25.695 --> 00:23:28.698
- This is Professor Lambeau.
- And this is Professor Hayes.

265
00:23:28.781 --> 00:23:30.741
Tom, please.

266
00:23:33.494 --> 00:23:35.913
This is important. Please.

267
00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:39.292
Willy didn't show for work today.

268
00:23:40.793 --> 00:23:42.961
Got this job through his P.O.
You can call him.

269
00:23:43.046 --> 00:23:47.091
- P.O.?
- Yeah. Parole officer.

270
00:23:51.137 --> 00:23:53.055
Thank you.

271
00:23:54.098 --> 00:23:56.266
Asshole.

272
00:23:58.311 --> 00:24:02.811
There is a lengthy legal precedent,
Your Honor, going back to 1789...

273
00:24:03.733 --> 00:24:06.819
whereby a defendant can claim self-defense
against an agent of the government...

274
00:24:06.903 --> 00:24:10.281
if that act is deemed a defense against
tyranny, a defense of liberty.

275
00:24:10.365 --> 00:24:14.865
Your Honor, Henry Ward Beecher in <i>Proverbs
from the Plymouth Pulpit</i>, 1887, said—

276
00:24:15.495 --> 00:24:16.287
1887?

277
00:24:16.371 --> 00:24:18.206
- Excuse me.
- This is the 20th century.

278
00:24:18.289 --> 00:24:19.290
He's gonna make a mockery.

279
00:24:19.374 --> 00:24:22.543
I am afforded the right to
speak in my own defense, sir...

280
00:24:22.627 --> 00:24:24.378
by the Constitution of the United States.

281
00:24:24.462 --> 00:24:27.214
- Don't tell me about the Constitution.
- This guarantees my liberty.

282
00:24:27.298 --> 00:24:29.800
“Liberty,” in case you've forgotten,
is a soul's right to breathe.

283
00:24:29.884 --> 00:24:32.386
When it cannot take a long breath,
laws are girded too tight.

284
00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:34.763
- Without liberty, man is a syncope.
- Man is a what?

285
00:24:34.847 --> 00:24:38.016
- Ibid., Your Honor.
- Son, my turn.

286
00:24:38.101 --> 00:24:42.601
I've been sitting here for 10 minutes now
lookin' over this rap sheet of yours.

287
00:24:42.855 --> 00:24:46.859
I just can't believe it.
June 93, assault.

288
00:24:46.943 --> 00:24:49.028
September '93, assault.

289
00:24:49.112 --> 00:24:52.698
Grand theft auto, February of '94.

290
00:24:52.782 --> 00:24:56.994
Where, apparently, you defended yourself
and had the case thrown out by citing...

291
00:24:57.078 --> 00:25:01.290
“free property rights
of horse and carriage” from 1798.

292
00:25:01.374 --> 00:25:04.919
Joke. January 95,
impersonating an officer.

293
00:25:05.003 --> 00:25:08.965
Mayhem, theft, resisting. All overturned.

294
00:25:09.048 --> 00:25:12.968
I'm also aware that you've been
through several foster homes.

295
00:25:13.052 --> 00:25:16.972
The state removed you from three
because of serious physical abuse.

296
00:25:17.056 --> 00:25:21.477
Another judge might care,
but you hit a cop. You're going in.

297
00:25:21.561 --> 00:25:25.022
Motion to dismiss is denied. $50,000 bail.

298
00:25:25.106 --> 00:25:26.690
Thank you.

299
00:25:26.774 --> 00:25:28.358
Court arise.

300
00:25:30.987 --> 00:25:33.030
- Hello?
- <i>Skylar?</i>

301
00:25:33.114 --> 00:25:35.241
- Yep.
- <i>Hey, it's Will.</i>

302
00:25:35.324 --> 00:25:36.992
- Who?
- <i>It's Will.</i>

303
00:25:37.076 --> 00:25:40.162
The really funny, good-looking guy
you met at the bar the other night.

304
00:25:40.246 --> 00:25:43.874
I don't recall meeting anyone who matches
that description. I think I'd remember.

305
00:25:43.958 --> 00:25:47.419
All right, you got me.
It's the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser...

306
00:25:47.503 --> 00:25:49.421
who got hammered
and wouldn't leave you alone all night.

307
00:25:49.505 --> 00:25:52.591
Oh, Will! I remember.

308
00:25:53.718 --> 00:25:56.554
How are you?
I was wondering if you'd call me.

309
00:25:56.637 --> 00:25:59.014
- <i>Yeah, look, I was wondering</i>—
- Yo, what's up, baby?

310
00:25:59.098 --> 00:26:03.185
- Hold on one second.
- What you doing? Want some of my ass?

311
00:26:03.269 --> 00:26:05.187
Herve, I remember you from juvi.

312
00:26:05.271 --> 00:26:06.855
- How you doing?
- What you doing?

313
00:26:06.939 --> 00:26:09.232
<i>Oh, yeah, sorry about that</i>

314
00:26:09.317 --> 00:26:12.069
I was wonderin' maybe
we could get together sometime this week.

315
00:26:12.153 --> 00:26:14.530
<i>Sit out at a café,
Maybe have some caramels.</i>

316
00:26:14.614 --> 00:26:16.115
That sounds wonderful.

317
00:26:16.199 --> 00:26:18.951
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- Yeah, sure. Where are you?

318
00:26:19.035 --> 00:26:22.038
Actually, this is just a shot in the dark...

319
00:26:22.121 --> 00:26:26.333
but there's no chance
that you're pre-law, is there?

320
00:26:30.588 --> 00:26:32.506
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

321
00:26:33.591 --> 00:26:35.509
Nice talking to ya.

322
00:26:38.096 --> 00:26:40.223
What the fuck do you want?

323
00:26:40.306 --> 00:26:43.100
I'm Gerald Lambeau.

324
00:26:43.184 --> 00:26:45.019
The professor you told to fuck himself.

325
00:26:47.271 --> 00:26:48.939
What the fuck do you want?

326
00:26:50.441 --> 00:26:54.486
I've spoken to the judge, and he's agreed
to release you under my supervision.

327
00:26:55.321 --> 00:26:56.989
- Really?
- Yeah.

328
00:27:02.328 --> 00:27:04.913
- Under two conditions.
- What are those?

329
00:27:04.997 --> 00:27:07.624
First condition is
that you meet with me every week.

330
00:27:07.708 --> 00:27:11.044
- What for?
- Go over the proof you're working on...

331
00:27:11.129 --> 00:27:14.507
get into some more advanced...

332
00:27:15.967 --> 00:27:18.928
combinatorial mathematics...

333
00:27:19.011 --> 00:27:20.971
finite math.

334
00:27:23.141 --> 00:27:25.059
Sounds like a real hoot.

335
00:27:26.519 --> 00:27:31.019
And the second condition is
that you see a therapist.

336
00:27:35.903 --> 00:27:39.239
I'm responsible to submit reports
on those meetings.

337
00:27:39.323 --> 00:27:43.823
If you fail to meet with any of those
conditions, you will have to serve time.

338
00:27:44.453 --> 00:27:48.874
I'll do the math, but I'm not gonna
meet with any fuckin' therapist.

339
00:27:48.958 --> 00:27:52.878
It's better than spending that time
in jail, isn't it?

340
00:28:56.525 --> 00:29:00.779
I read your book, and “Mike”
was havin' the same problems...

341
00:29:00.863 --> 00:29:03.115
that “Chad,” the stockbroker, was havin'.

342
00:29:03.199 --> 00:29:06.202
Absolutely right.
Right on the button. Good for you, Will.

343
00:29:06.285 --> 00:29:08.245
- Very nice.
- Thank you.

344
00:29:08.329 --> 00:29:11.248
Will, the pressures—
And I'm not judging them.

345
00:29:11.332 --> 00:29:14.168
I'm not labeling them—

346
00:29:14.252 --> 00:29:17.129
But they are destroying your potential.

347
00:29:17.213 --> 00:29:21.713
No more shenanigans.
No more tomfoolery. No more ballyhoo.

348
00:29:22.343 --> 00:29:26.843
You're right. God, I know.

349
00:29:28.516 --> 00:29:31.101
You're not gonna get off that easily.
Come on, Will. A bit more.

350
00:29:31.185 --> 00:29:35.685
- Well, I do do things, you know?
- What kind of things?

351
00:29:36.274 --> 00:29:38.859
I do things that—
I hide from people.

352
00:29:38.943 --> 00:29:43.443
- You hide, do you?
- No, no. I go places. I interact.

353
00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:46.492
- Really? What sort of places?
- Just certain clubs.

354
00:29:46.575 --> 00:29:48.660
More. That's nice. Yes.
What sort of clubs?

355
00:29:48.744 --> 00:29:51.121
Like, like Fantasy.

356
00:29:51.205 --> 00:29:54.708
Fantasy. That's nice. A bit more.

357
00:29:54.792 --> 00:29:58.462
It's something like when you get in there,
the music owns you.

358
00:29:58.546 --> 00:30:01.006
It's like that house music.
It's like—

359
00:30:03.968 --> 00:30:06.428
- You start dancin'.
- Boom, boom, boom. Yes.

360
00:30:06.512 --> 00:30:08.847
It's just—

361
00:30:09.557 --> 00:30:10.558
Yes.

362
00:30:14.312 --> 00:30:16.772
Do you find it hard to hide
the fact that you're gay?

363
00:30:16.856 --> 00:30:19.733
What are you talking about? What?

364
00:30:19.817 --> 00:30:22.528
Look, buddy, two seconds ago,
you were ready to give me a jump.

365
00:30:22.611 --> 00:30:24.863
A jump? Are you—

366
00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:28.158
I'm terribly sorry to disappoint you.

367
00:30:28.242 --> 00:30:30.994
I don't have a problem with it.
I don't care if you putt from the rough.

368
00:30:31.078 --> 00:30:34.956
What? Putting from the rough?
What on earth are you talking about?

369
00:30:35.041 --> 00:30:39.541
A difficult theorem
can be like a symphony.

370
00:30:40.379 --> 00:30:42.964
It's very erotic.

371
00:30:43.049 --> 00:30:45.384
You go somewhere else.
I can't handle this.

372
00:30:45.468 --> 00:30:47.636
- Wow.
- Thank you, Henry.

373
00:30:48.888 --> 00:30:51.599
- Henry.
- Hi, Gerry.

374
00:30:51.682 --> 00:30:54.101
You know something?
I can't do this pro bono work anymore.

375
00:30:54.185 --> 00:30:56.687
- It's not worth it.
- What happened?

376
00:30:56.771 --> 00:30:58.689
I'm going on national
television next week.

377
00:30:58.773 --> 00:31:02.276
I haven't got time to tell you,
much less talk to that raving looney in there.

378
00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:04.070
An absolute lunatic, he is.

379
00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:10.659
Okay, you are in your bed, Will.

380
00:31:10.743 --> 00:31:14.371
Now, how old are you?

381
00:31:15.498 --> 00:31:17.416
Seven.

382
00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:19.418
What do you see?

383
00:31:21.253 --> 00:31:23.922
Something's in my room.

384
00:31:24.006 --> 00:31:26.591
What is it?

385
00:31:26.675 --> 00:31:31.175
It's a figure.
It's hoverin' over me.

386
00:31:31.764 --> 00:31:35.309
You are in a safe place, Will.

387
00:31:35.393 --> 00:31:38.813
It's touchin' me.

388
00:31:38.896 --> 00:31:41.440
Where is it touching you?

389
00:31:41.941 --> 00:31:44.401
It's touching me down there...

390
00:31:45.986 --> 00:31:47.988
and I'm nervous.

391
00:31:48.072 --> 00:31:51.825
You don't have to be nervous, Will.

392
00:31:51.909 --> 00:31:55.746
We start dancin' and dancin'.

393
00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:57.832
It's just beautiful...

394
00:31:57.915 --> 00:31:59.750
'cause we can make...

395
00:31:59.834 --> 00:32:04.334
a lot of love before the sun goes down.

396
00:32:05.423 --> 00:32:09.427
<i>Skyrockets in flight</i>

397
00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:12.262
<i>Afternoon delight</i>

398
00:32:12.346 --> 00:32:15.807
<i>- Hey, hey, hey Afternoon delight</i>
- Jesus.

399
00:32:15.891 --> 00:32:19.811
<i>Skyrockets in flight
Da-da-da-da</i>

400
00:32:19.895 --> 00:32:22.856
- I'm sorry, Rich.
- I have better things to do with my time.

401
00:32:23.524 --> 00:32:26.985
<i>Hey, hey Afternoon delight</i>
Come on! One dance!

402
00:32:27.069 --> 00:32:29.946
You really hypnotized me, you know?

403
00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:32.532
- For God's sake, Will.
- What? Oh, come on. He left.

404
00:32:32.616 --> 00:32:36.578
- You can't pin that on me.
- I told you to cooperate with these people.

405
00:32:36.662 --> 00:32:39.539
- Look into my eyes.
- Get out, Will.

406
00:32:39.623 --> 00:32:42.208
I don't need therapy.

407
00:32:42.293 --> 00:32:43.961
That's enough. Get out!

408
00:32:46.255 --> 00:32:50.425
- I called Mel Weintraub this morning to see—
- What's the use?

409
00:32:50.509 --> 00:32:52.427
What do you want to do?

410
00:32:54.472 --> 00:32:58.972
- There is someone.
- Who is he?

411
00:32:59.143 --> 00:33:03.643
He used to be my roommate
in college.

412
00:33:08.027 --> 00:33:11.947
Trust. Very important in a relationship.

413
00:33:12.031 --> 00:33:13.991
It's also very important
in a clinical situation.

414
00:33:14.074 --> 00:33:16.910
Why is trust the most important thing...

415
00:33:16.994 --> 00:33:19.621
in making a breakthrough with a client?

416
00:33:21.457 --> 00:33:25.957
Maureen, stop the oral fixation
for a moment and join us.

417
00:33:29.715 --> 00:33:32.676
Because—

418
00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:35.846
Trust is— Trust is life.

419
00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:39.558
Wow. That's very deep. Thank you, Vinnie.

420
00:33:39.642 --> 00:33:42.311
Next time, get the notes
from your brother.

421
00:33:42.394 --> 00:33:45.814
If a patient doesn't feel safe enough
to trust you, then they won't be honest with you.

422
00:33:45.898 --> 00:33:48.066
Then there's really no point
for them being in therapy.

423
00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:51.361
Hey, if they don't trust you,
you're never gonna get them to sleep with you.

424
00:33:51.445 --> 00:33:55.282
That should be the goal of any good therapist.
Nail 'em while they're vulnerable.

425
00:33:55.366 --> 00:33:57.076
That's my motto.

426
00:33:57.159 --> 00:33:59.703
Oh, good, everyone's back.
Welcome back, everybody.

427
00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:04.875
- Hello, Sean.
- Hey, Gerry.

428
00:34:08.754 --> 00:34:12.090
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are in the presence of greatness.

429
00:34:12.174 --> 00:34:16.136
Professor Gerald Lambeau, Field's medal
winner for combinatorial mathematics.

430
00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:19.014
- Hello.
- Anyone know what the Field's medal is?

431
00:34:19.098 --> 00:34:21.892
It's a really big deal.
It's like the Nobel prize for math.

432
00:34:21.976 --> 00:34:26.476
Except they only give it out
once every four years. It's a great thing.

433
00:34:27.064 --> 00:34:30.192
It's an amazing honor.
Okay, everybody, that's it for today.

434
00:34:30.276 --> 00:34:33.654
Thanks. We'll see you Monday.
We'll be talking about Freud.

435
00:34:33.737 --> 00:34:37.115
Why he did enough cocaine
to kill a small horse. Thank you.

436
00:34:38.951 --> 00:34:41.620
- How are you?
- It's good to see you.

437
00:34:41.704 --> 00:34:43.622
Good to see you.

438
00:34:43.706 --> 00:34:47.292
- Sean, I think I got something interesting for ya.
- Yeah?

439
00:34:47.376 --> 00:34:49.920
What, you have to have blood and urine?
What's up?

440
00:34:50.004 --> 00:34:52.339
Why didn't you come to the reunion?

441
00:34:52.423 --> 00:34:55.884
You know, I've been busy.

442
00:34:55.968 --> 00:34:57.886
- You were missed.
- Really?

443
00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:00.931
So how long has it been
since we've seen each other?

444
00:35:01.015 --> 00:35:04.268
- Before Nancy died.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

445
00:35:04.351 --> 00:35:07.020
I was in Paris.
It was that damn conference.

446
00:35:07.104 --> 00:35:08.814
I got your card. It was nice.

447
00:35:14.153 --> 00:35:16.029
- Come here.
- Now that's a good take down.

448
00:35:16.113 --> 00:35:20.033
Hey, what happened?
Did you get leniency or what?

449
00:35:20.117 --> 00:35:24.617
I got probation
and then counseling two days a week.

450
00:35:24.913 --> 00:35:28.541
Joke. You're a smoothie.
Come on, Morgan! Just submit!

451
00:35:29.585 --> 00:35:32.838
Hey, Bill, just get off him.
We're gonna miss the game.

452
00:35:32.921 --> 00:35:34.923
- I've got a full schedule. I'm very busy.
- Sean.

453
00:35:35.007 --> 00:35:38.010
This boy is incredible.
I've never seen anything like him.

454
00:35:38.093 --> 00:35:39.719
What makes him so incredible, Gerry?

455
00:35:41.555 --> 00:35:45.600
- You ever heard of Ramanujan?
- Yeah, yeah. No.

456
00:35:45.684 --> 00:35:50.184
It's a man. He lived over 100 years ago.
He was Indian.

457
00:35:50.481 --> 00:35:53.400
- Dots, not feathers.
- Not feathers. Yeah.

458
00:35:53.484 --> 00:35:55.360
He lived in this tiny hut
somewhere in India.

459
00:35:55.444 --> 00:35:57.904
He had no formal education.

460
00:35:57.988 --> 00:36:00.448
- He had no access to any scientific work.
- Coffee?

461
00:36:00.532 --> 00:36:02.784
- You, sir?
- Just a little.

462
00:36:02.868 --> 00:36:05.287
- But he came across this old math book...
- Thanks.

463
00:36:05.371 --> 00:36:07.956
And from this simple text,
he was able to extrapolate theories...

464
00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:09.916
that had baffled mathematicians for years.

465
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.086
Yes. Continued fractions. He wrote—

466
00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:17.299
- He mailed it to Hardy at Cambridge.
- Yeah, Cambridge. Yeah.

467
00:36:17.383 --> 00:36:20.677
And Hardy immediately recognized
the brilliance of his work...

468
00:36:20.761 --> 00:36:24.347
and brought him over to England,
and then they worked together for years...

469
00:36:24.431 --> 00:36:26.891
creating some of the most
exciting math theory ever done.

470
00:36:27.893 --> 00:36:32.272
This Ramanujan,
his genius was unparalleled, Sean.

471
00:36:33.482 --> 00:36:35.108
This boy's just like that.

472
00:36:36.944 --> 00:36:40.530
But he's a bit defensive.

473
00:36:40.614 --> 00:36:42.574
I need someone who can get through to him.

474
00:36:43.909 --> 00:36:46.161
- Like me?
- Yeah, like you.

475
00:36:46.245 --> 00:36:49.289
- Why?
- Because you have the same kind of background.

476
00:36:49.373 --> 00:36:52.709
- What background?
- You're from the same neighborhood.

477
00:36:52.793 --> 00:36:55.504
- He's from Southie?
- Yeah.

478
00:36:55.587 --> 00:36:59.007
Boy genius from Southie.

479
00:36:59.091 --> 00:37:03.220
- How many shrinks you go to before me?
- Five.

480
00:37:04.096 --> 00:37:07.641
- Let me guess. Barry? Henry? Not Rick?
- Yeah. Yeah.

481
00:37:07.725 --> 00:37:10.811
Sean, please, just meet
with him once a week.

482
00:37:10.894 --> 00:37:12.896
Please?

483
00:37:16.024 --> 00:37:19.152
It's a poker game with this kid.
Don't let him know what you've got.

484
00:37:19.236 --> 00:37:22.364
He probably even read your book,
if he could find it.

485
00:37:22.448 --> 00:37:24.741
It's gonna be hard for him to find.

486
00:37:24.825 --> 00:37:26.326
- Hi, Will.

487
00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:28.286
This is Sean Maguire. Will Hunting.

488
00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:30.330
How are ya?

489
00:37:34.752 --> 00:37:36.670
- Yeah. Let's get started.
- Yeah, let's do it.

490
00:37:36.754 --> 00:37:38.839
I'm pumped. Let's let the healing begin.

491
00:37:38.922 --> 00:37:42.467
- Would you excuse us?
- Yeah, please, Tom.

492
00:37:42.551 --> 00:37:45.136
You, too, Gerry.

493
00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:47.138
Yeah, of course.

494
00:37:52.561 --> 00:37:54.479
How are you?

495
00:37:56.523 --> 00:37:58.858
Where you from in Southie?

496
00:37:58.942 --> 00:38:01.819
- I like what you've done with the place.
- Thanks.

497
00:38:01.904 --> 00:38:04.156
Do you buy all these books retail...

498
00:38:04.239 --> 00:38:08.326
or do you send away for, like, a “shrink kit”
that comes with all these volumes included?

499
00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:10.995
- Do you like books?
- Yeah.

500
00:38:12.039 --> 00:38:14.166
- Did you read any of these books?
- I don't know.

501
00:38:14.249 --> 00:38:16.960
- How about any of these books?
- Probably not.

502
00:38:17.044 --> 00:38:20.756
What about the ones on the top shelf?
You read those?

503
00:38:20.839 --> 00:38:24.759
- Yeah, I read those.
- Good for you. What do you think about 'em?

504
00:38:24.843 --> 00:38:27.679
I'm not here for a fuckin' book report.
They're your books. Why don't you read 'em?

505
00:38:27.763 --> 00:38:29.556
I did. I had to.

506
00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:33.143
- Must've taken you a long time.
- Yeah, it did.

507
00:38:39.817 --> 00:38:44.317
<i>United States of America:
A Complete History, Volume I.</i>

508
00:38:55.123 --> 00:38:58.668
Jesus. If you wanna read
a real history book...

509
00:38:58.752 --> 00:39:00.712
read Howard Zion's <i>A People's History
of the United States.</i>

510
00:39:00.796 --> 00:39:02.672
That book'll fuckin'
knock you on your ass.

511
00:39:02.756 --> 00:39:04.758
Better than Chomsky's
<i>Manufacturing Consent?</i>

512
00:39:04.842 --> 00:39:09.342
- Do you think that's a good book?
- You fuckin' people baffle me.

513
00:39:09.721 --> 00:39:13.182
You spend all your money on these fuckin'
fancy books. You surround yourselves with 'em.

514
00:39:13.267 --> 00:39:16.853
- They're the wrong fuckin' books.
- What are the right fuckin' books, Will?

515
00:39:16.937 --> 00:39:21.274
- Whatever blows your hair back.
- Yeah. Haven't got much hair left.

516
00:39:21.358 --> 00:39:23.943
Hey, you know you'd be better off
shoving that cigarette up your ass.

517
00:39:24.027 --> 00:39:26.154
- It'd probably be healthier for you.
- Yeah, I know.

518
00:39:26.238 --> 00:39:29.616
- It really gets in the way of my yoga.
- You work out, huh?

519
00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:32.661
- What, you lift?
- Yeah.

520
00:39:32.744 --> 00:39:35.204
- Nautilus?
- No, free weights.

521
00:39:35.289 --> 00:39:36.707
- Really? Free weights, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah, big time.

522
00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:38.041
- Yeah?
- Just like that.

523
00:39:38.125 --> 00:39:40.627
- What do you bench?
- 285. What do you bench?

524
00:39:42.921 --> 00:39:45.131
You paint that?

525
00:39:45.215 --> 00:39:47.091
Yeah. Do you paint?

526
00:39:47.175 --> 00:39:50.178
- Do you sculpt?
- No.

527
00:39:50.262 --> 00:39:53.056
Do you like art?

528
00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:57.477
- Do you like music?
- This is a real piece of shit.

529
00:39:57.561 --> 00:39:59.479
Oh, tell me what you really think.

530
00:39:59.563 --> 00:40:04.063
Just the linear and impressionistic mix
makes a very muddled composition.

531
00:40:05.277 --> 00:40:09.489
It's also a Winslow Homer rip-off,
except you got whitey rowin' the boat there.

532
00:40:09.573 --> 00:40:11.491
It's art, Monet.
It wasn't very good.

533
00:40:11.575 --> 00:40:14.035
- That's not really what concerns me though.
- What concerns you?

534
00:40:14.119 --> 00:40:16.538
- Just the coloring.
- You know what the real bitch of it is?

535
00:40:16.622 --> 00:40:18.707
It's paint-by-number.

536
00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:21.209
Is it color-by-number?
Because the colors are fascinating to me.

537
00:40:21.293 --> 00:40:22.752
- Aren't they really?
- You bet.

538
00:40:22.836 --> 00:40:26.506
I think you're about one step away from
cuttin' your fuckin' ear off.

539
00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:28.216
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

540
00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:31.928
Think I should move to the south
of France, change my name to “Vincent”?

541
00:40:32.012 --> 00:40:33.888
You ever heard the sayin',
“any port in a storm”?

542
00:40:33.972 --> 00:40:35.348
Yeah.

543
00:40:35.432 --> 00:40:38.393
- Yeah, maybe that means you.
- In what way?

544
00:40:38.477 --> 00:40:40.937
Maybe you're in the middle of a storm,
a big fuckin' storm.

545
00:40:41.021 --> 00:40:42.022
Yeah, maybe.

546
00:40:42.105 --> 00:40:45.149
The sky's fallin' on your head.
The waves are crashin' over your little boat.

547
00:40:45.233 --> 00:40:47.318
The oars are about to snap.

548
00:40:47.402 --> 00:40:49.362
You just piss in your pants.
You're cryin' for the harbor.

549
00:40:49.446 --> 00:40:51.698
So maybe you do
what you gotta do to get out.

550
00:40:51.782 --> 00:40:54.075
Maybe you became a psychologist.

551
00:40:54.159 --> 00:40:57.662
Bingo. That's it. Let me do my job now.
You start with me. Come on.

552
00:41:00.123 --> 00:41:03.251
- Maybe you married the wrong woman.
- Maybe you should watch your mouth!

553
00:41:05.545 --> 00:41:08.506
Watch it right there, chief, all right?

554
00:41:16.139 --> 00:41:18.599
That's it, isn't it?

555
00:41:18.684 --> 00:41:20.644
You married the wrong woman.

556
00:41:22.312 --> 00:41:26.812
What happened? What, did she leave you?

557
00:41:26.984 --> 00:41:30.028
Was she banging some other guy?

558
00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:34.782
If you ever disrespect my wife again,
I will end you.

559
00:41:34.866 --> 00:41:36.951
I will fuckin' end you.

560
00:41:37.035 --> 00:41:38.911
Got that, chief?

561
00:41:40.622 --> 00:41:42.540
Time's up.

562
00:41:43.375 --> 00:41:44.918
Yeah.

563
00:41:58.223 --> 00:42:00.183
At ease, gentlemen.

564
00:42:06.273 --> 00:42:08.233
You okay?

565
00:42:13.613 --> 00:42:17.617
Look, I'll understand
if you don't wanna meet with him again.

566
00:42:17.701 --> 00:42:21.413
Thursday, 4:00. Make sure the kid's here.

567
00:42:23.248 --> 00:42:26.251
Yeah. Thanks.

568
00:43:32.901 --> 00:43:34.944
You look lovely in those glasses.

569
00:43:35.028 --> 00:43:36.946
- Thank you very much.
- They're just beautiful.

570
00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:40.992
- Yes, I always wanted dark blue eye shadow.
- Wonderful.

571
00:43:43.578 --> 00:43:46.998
Growing up in England,
I went to a very nice school.

572
00:43:47.082 --> 00:43:51.582
You know, it was kind of progressive,
organic, do-it-yourself, private school.

573
00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:56.920
Then Harvard. Hopefully med school.

574
00:43:57.008 --> 00:43:58.926
I figured out, at the end...

575
00:43:59.010 --> 00:44:03.264
my brain's gonna be worth $250,000.

576
00:44:03.348 --> 00:44:05.308
That sounded horrible, didn't it?

577
00:44:07.727 --> 00:44:09.562
Bring me another mai tai!

578
00:44:09.646 --> 00:44:13.900
Nah, that's cool.
I bet your parents were happy to pay.

579
00:44:13.984 --> 00:44:17.862
No, I was happy to pay.
I inherited the money.

580
00:44:17.946 --> 00:44:21.324
Wow. Is Harvard gettin' all that money?

581
00:44:21.408 --> 00:44:24.452
No, Stanford.
I'm going there in June when I graduate.

582
00:44:24.536 --> 00:44:28.790
All right, so you just wanted
to use this sailor and then run away, huh?

583
00:44:28.874 --> 00:44:32.836
I was gonna experiment on you
for anatomy class first, obviously.

584
00:44:32.919 --> 00:44:35.254
In that case, that's fine.

585
00:44:35.338 --> 00:44:38.090
- Hey, you wanna see my magic trick, Skylar?
- Of course.

586
00:44:38.175 --> 00:44:41.344
All right. Promise to—

587
00:44:41.428 --> 00:44:43.721
All right.

588
00:44:43.805 --> 00:44:47.475
- This one's for you, Rudolph.
- Wait, wait. You need my wand.

589
00:44:47.559 --> 00:44:50.395
All right, give me a hit.
Thank you. All right.

590
00:44:50.478 --> 00:44:52.354
I'm gonna make
all these caramels disappear.

591
00:44:52.439 --> 00:44:55.233
You ready? Ready.

592
00:44:55.317 --> 00:44:57.902
One, two, three.

593
00:44:57.986 --> 00:45:00.989
They're all gone.

594
00:45:01.072 --> 00:45:03.574
That was my—
It works better when I have my rabbit.

595
00:45:03.658 --> 00:45:06.661
Well—

596
00:45:06.745 --> 00:45:09.372
I don't really date, you know, that much.

597
00:45:09.456 --> 00:45:12.250
How very unfortunate... I think for me.

598
00:45:14.461 --> 00:45:17.755
You know what I mean?
I know you've been thinking about it.

599
00:45:17.839 --> 00:45:19.757
- Oh, no, I haven't.
- Yes, you have.

600
00:45:19.841 --> 00:45:21.217
- No, I really haven't.
- Yes, you have.

601
00:45:21.301 --> 00:45:22.844
You were hoping
to get a good night kiss.

602
00:45:22.928 --> 00:45:25.722
No, you know, I tell ya,
I was hopin' to get a good night lay.

603
00:45:28.225 --> 00:45:30.685
But I'll settle for a kiss, you know?

604
00:45:30.769 --> 00:45:33.563
- How very noble of you.
- Thank you.

605
00:45:33.647 --> 00:45:37.150
No, I was hopin' for a kiss.

606
00:45:38.485 --> 00:45:40.945
I think we should
just get it out of the way now.

607
00:45:42.781 --> 00:45:45.200
- Right now?
- Yeah.

608
00:45:45.283 --> 00:45:47.201
Come on.

609
00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:58.463
I think I got some of your pickle.

610
00:46:08.974 --> 00:46:11.476
You again, huh?

611
00:46:13.395 --> 00:46:15.647
Come with me.

612
00:46:21.486 --> 00:46:25.740
So what's this?
A Taster's Choice moment between guys?

613
00:46:27.033 --> 00:46:31.533
This is really nice. You got a thing
for swans? Is this a fetish?

614
00:46:31.705 --> 00:46:34.040
Is it something maybe
we need to devote some time to?

615
00:46:35.959 --> 00:46:39.504
Thought about what you said
to me the other day. About my painting.

616
00:46:41.339 --> 00:46:44.300
Stayed up half the night
thinking about it.

617
00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:47.637
Something occurred to me.

618
00:46:47.721 --> 00:46:52.221
I fell into a deep, peaceful sleep and
haven't thought about you since.

619
00:46:52.350 --> 00:46:55.353
- You know what occurred to me?
- No.

620
00:46:55.437 --> 00:46:59.937
You're just a kid. You don't have
the faintest idea what you're talking about.

621
00:47:00.025 --> 00:47:02.152
- Why, thank you.
- It's all right.

622
00:47:03.194 --> 00:47:05.613
You've never been out of Boston.

623
00:47:07.782 --> 00:47:09.700
Nope.

624
00:47:09.784 --> 00:47:11.952
So if I asked you about art,
you'd probably give me the skinny...

625
00:47:12.037 --> 00:47:14.622
on every art book ever written.

626
00:47:14.706 --> 00:47:18.459
Michelangelo? You know a lot about him.

627
00:47:18.543 --> 00:47:22.171
Life's work, political aspirations.
Him and the pope.

628
00:47:22.255 --> 00:47:24.465
Sexual orientation.
The whole works, right?

629
00:47:27.135 --> 00:47:31.556
I'll bet you can't tell me
what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel.

630
00:47:33.308 --> 00:47:37.729
You never actually stood there
and looked up at that beautiful ceiling.

631
00:47:40.398 --> 00:47:42.942
Seen that.

632
00:47:43.026 --> 00:47:44.944
If I ask you about women...

633
00:47:45.028 --> 00:47:48.656
you'll probably give me a syllabus of
your personal favorites.

634
00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:51.701
You may have even been laid a few times.

635
00:47:56.748 --> 00:48:00.001
But you can't tell me what it feels like
to wake up next to a woman...

636
00:48:00.085 --> 00:48:02.545
and feel truly happy.

637
00:48:05.632 --> 00:48:07.592
You're a tough kid.

638
00:48:09.427 --> 00:48:13.222
I ask you about war, you'd probably throw
Shakespeare at me, right?

639
00:48:13.306 --> 00:48:16.767
“Once more into the breach, dear friends.”

640
00:48:18.019 --> 00:48:19.937
But you've never been near one.

641
00:48:21.189 --> 00:48:23.900
You've never held
your best friend's head in your lap...

642
00:48:23.983 --> 00:48:28.445
and watch him gasp
his last breath lookin' to you for help.

643
00:48:30.365 --> 00:48:33.743
If I asked you about love,
you'd probably quote me a sonnet...

644
00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:39.749
but you've never looked
at a woman and been totally vulnerable.

645
00:48:39.833 --> 00:48:42.794
Known someone that could
level you with her eyes.

646
00:48:44.212 --> 00:48:48.674
Feelin' like God put
an angel on Earth just for you...

647
00:48:48.758 --> 00:48:50.968
who could rescue you
from the depths of hell.

648
00:48:51.803 --> 00:48:54.347
And you wouldn't know
what it's like to be her angel...

649
00:48:55.056 --> 00:48:58.100
to have that love for her
be there forever.

650
00:48:58.184 --> 00:49:01.979
Through anything. Through cancer.

651
00:49:02.772 --> 00:49:05.024
And you wouldn't know about sleepin'
sittin' up in a hospital room...

652
00:49:05.108 --> 00:49:07.193
for two months, holding her hand...

653
00:49:07.277 --> 00:49:09.195
because the doctors
could see in your eyes...

654
00:49:09.279 --> 00:49:11.781
that the terms “visiting hours”
don't apply to you.

655
00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:16.077
You don't know about real loss...

656
00:49:16.161 --> 00:49:19.831
'cause that only occurs when you love
something more than you love yourself.

657
00:49:21.291 --> 00:49:25.211
I doubt you've ever dared
to love anybody that much.

658
00:49:27.589 --> 00:49:31.759
I look at you,
I don't see an intelligent, confident man.

659
00:49:34.846 --> 00:49:38.307
I see a cocky, scared shitless kid.

660
00:49:40.018 --> 00:49:43.396
But you're a genius, Will.
No one denies that.

661
00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:47.025
No one could possibly understand
the depths of you.

662
00:49:47.108 --> 00:49:50.152
But you presumed to know everything
about me because you saw a painting of mine.

663
00:49:50.236 --> 00:49:52.696
You ripped my fuckin' life apart.

664
00:49:56.701 --> 00:49:58.744
You're an orphan, right?

665
00:50:02.874 --> 00:50:06.961
Do you think I'd know the first thing
about how hard your life has been—

666
00:50:07.045 --> 00:50:09.630
How you feel, who you are—

667
00:50:09.714 --> 00:50:11.841
Because I read Oliver Twist?

668
00:50:13.218 --> 00:50:15.511
Does that encapsulate you?

669
00:50:17.805 --> 00:50:20.766
Personally, I don't give a shit
about all that, because—

670
00:50:20.850 --> 00:50:22.977
You know what?
I can't learn anything from you...

671
00:50:23.061 --> 00:50:25.521
I can't read in some fuckin' book.

672
00:50:27.357 --> 00:50:29.442
Unless you wanna talk about you...

673
00:50:29.526 --> 00:50:31.444
who you are.

674
00:50:32.904 --> 00:50:36.908
And I'm fascinated. I'm in.

675
00:50:38.952 --> 00:50:40.912
But you don't wanna do that,
do you, sport?

676
00:50:44.249 --> 00:50:46.084
You're terrified of what you might say.

677
00:50:52.215 --> 00:50:54.133
Your move, chief.

678
00:52:01.784 --> 00:52:04.036
Hello? Hello?

679
00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:06.997
Hello?

680
00:52:07.081 --> 00:52:10.000
Professor Valenti,
are you calling me again?

681
00:52:12.962 --> 00:52:14.838
Freak.

682
00:52:18.676 --> 00:52:21.345
- Oh, fuck.
- Christ, who did you call?

683
00:52:21.429 --> 00:52:23.931
- No one. I forgot the number.
- You fuckin' retarded?

684
00:52:24.015 --> 00:52:26.559
You went all the way out there in the rain,
and you didn't bring the number?

685
00:52:26.643 --> 00:52:30.563
No, it was your mother's 900 number.
I just ran out of quarters.

686
00:52:30.647 --> 00:52:33.191
Why don't we get off our mothers?
I just got off yours.

687
00:52:33.274 --> 00:52:35.401
That's pretty funny, Morgan.

688
00:52:35.485 --> 00:52:37.945
That's a fuckin' nickel, bitch.

689
00:52:38.029 --> 00:52:40.239
- Keep antagonizing me. Watch what happens.
- All right, then, Morgan.

690
00:52:40.323 --> 00:52:42.158
- Watch what happens.
- All right, then, Morgan.

691
00:52:42.241 --> 00:52:44.243
Keep fuckin' with me.

692
00:52:50.416 --> 00:52:52.376
No smoking.

693
00:53:24.242 --> 00:53:26.994
What do you mean, he didn't talk?
You were in there for an hour.

694
00:53:27.078 --> 00:53:30.331
He just sat there counting the seconds
until the session was over.

695
00:53:30.415 --> 00:53:33.084
- Pretty impressive, actually.
- Why would he do that?

696
00:53:33.167 --> 00:53:37.171
To prove to me he doesn't have to
talk to me if he doesn't want to.

697
00:53:37.255 --> 00:53:41.175
What is this? Some kind of staring contest
between two kids from the old neighborhood?

698
00:53:41.259 --> 00:53:45.012
Yeah, it is, and I can't talk first.

699
00:53:45.096 --> 00:53:49.596
We know your theory, Alexander, but the boy's
found a simple geometrical picture.

700
00:53:50.143 --> 00:53:53.146
- A tree structure won't work.
- Look now. He's joining the two vertices.

701
00:53:53.229 --> 00:53:55.731
But I can do the sum.

702
00:53:55.815 --> 00:53:58.275
- It's how you group the terms, Alexander.
- But, Gerry.

703
00:53:58.359 --> 00:54:00.277
If we do the whole thing this way, then—

704
00:54:00.361 --> 00:54:03.113
Hey, look, look.

705
00:54:03.197 --> 00:54:06.617
I wrote it down. It's simpler this way.

706
00:54:17.170 --> 00:54:20.089
Sometimes people get lucky.

707
00:54:20.173 --> 00:54:22.133
You're a brilliant man.

708
00:54:59.420 --> 00:55:02.005
You know, I was on this plane once...

709
00:55:02.089 --> 00:55:04.925
and I'm sittin' there, and...

710
00:55:05.009 --> 00:55:06.927
the captain gets on,
he does his whole, you know...

711
00:55:07.011 --> 00:55:09.596
“We'll be cruisin' at 35,000 feet,” but
then he puts the mike down.

712
00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:12.349
He forgets to turn it off.

713
00:55:12.433 --> 00:55:14.309
So he turns to the copilot. He's, like...

714
00:55:14.393 --> 00:55:18.893
“You know, all I could use right now is
a fuckin' blow job and a cup of coffee.”

715
00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:21.775
So the stewardess fuckin' goes
bombin' up from the back of the plane...

716
00:55:21.859 --> 00:55:23.485
to tell him the microphone's still on.

717
00:55:23.569 --> 00:55:26.905
This guy in the back of the plane's like,
“Hey, hon, don't forget the coffee.”

718
00:55:28.658 --> 00:55:30.451
You ever been on a plane?

719
00:55:30.535 --> 00:55:33.538
No, but it's a fuckin' joke. It works
better if I tell it in the first person.

720
00:55:33.621 --> 00:55:35.539
Yeah, it does.

721
00:55:38.709 --> 00:55:40.669
I have been laid, you know?

722
00:55:40.753 --> 00:55:42.963
Really? Good for you.

723
00:55:43.047 --> 00:55:45.007
- Big time, big time.
- Big time, huh?

724
00:55:45.091 --> 00:55:48.219
I went on a date last week.

725
00:55:48.302 --> 00:55:51.263
- How'd it go?
- It was good.

726
00:55:51.347 --> 00:55:53.265
- Goin' out again?
- I don't know.

727
00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:55.059
- Why not?
- Haven't called her.

728
00:55:55.142 --> 00:55:58.436
- Christ, you're an amateur.
- I know what I'm doin'.

729
00:55:58.521 --> 00:56:02.816
Yeah. Don't worry about me.
I know what I'm doin'.

730
00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:05.360
Yeah, but this girl was, like,
you know, beautiful.

731
00:56:05.444 --> 00:56:09.781
She's smart. She's fun. She's different
from most of the girls I've been with.

732
00:56:09.866 --> 00:56:13.703
- So call her up, Romeo.
- Why? So I can realize she's not that smart?

733
00:56:13.786 --> 00:56:16.163
That she's fuckin' boring?
I mean, you don't—

734
00:56:16.247 --> 00:56:19.625
This girl's, like, fuckin' perfect right now.
I don't wanna ruin that.

735
00:56:19.709 --> 00:56:23.629
Maybe you're perfect right now.
Maybe you don't wanna ruin that.

736
00:56:25.381 --> 00:56:27.674
But I think that's a super philosophy, Will.

737
00:56:27.758 --> 00:56:31.511
That way, you can go through your entire life
without ever having to really know anybody.

738
00:56:35.933 --> 00:56:37.809
My wife used to fart when she was nervous.

739
00:56:37.894 --> 00:56:40.938
She had all sorts
of wonderful idiosyncrasies.

740
00:56:41.022 --> 00:56:43.607
You know, she used to fart in her sleep.

741
00:56:43.691 --> 00:56:46.527
Just thought I'd share that with you.

742
00:56:46.611 --> 00:56:49.155
One night it was so loud,
it woke the dog up.

743
00:56:53.075 --> 00:56:54.993
She woke up and gone, like,
“Was that you?”

744
00:56:55.077 --> 00:56:58.246
I said, “Yeah.” I didn't have the heart
to tell her. Oh, God.

745
00:56:58.331 --> 00:57:00.499
- She woke herself up?
- Yes.

746
00:57:05.588 --> 00:57:10.088
Oh, Christ. But, Will, she's been dead
two years, and that's the shit I remember.

747
00:57:10.927 --> 00:57:14.138
It's wonderful stuff, you know?
Little things like that.

748
00:57:14.221 --> 00:57:18.183
Yeah, but those are the things
I miss the most.

749
00:57:18.267 --> 00:57:21.186
Those little idiosyncrasies
that only I knew about.

750
00:57:21.270 --> 00:57:23.855
That's what made her my wife.

751
00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:27.234
Boy, and she had the goods on me too.
She knew all my little peccadillos.

752
00:57:27.318 --> 00:57:31.780
People call these things “imperfections,”
but they're not.

753
00:57:31.864 --> 00:57:34.616
That's the good stuff.

754
00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:38.036
And then we get to choose who we let into
our weird little worlds.

755
00:57:39.455 --> 00:57:41.331
You're not perfect, sport.

756
00:57:41.415 --> 00:57:44.126
And let me save you the suspense.

757
00:57:44.210 --> 00:57:47.463
This girl you met,
she isn't perfect either.

758
00:57:47.546 --> 00:57:51.383
But the question is whether or not
you're perfect for each other.

759
00:57:51.467 --> 00:57:55.762
That's the whole deal.
That's what intimacy is all about.

760
00:57:55.846 --> 00:57:57.764
Now you can know
everything in the world, sport...

761
00:57:57.848 --> 00:58:00.934
but the only way you're findin' out
that one is by givin' it a shot.

762
00:58:01.018 --> 00:58:03.729
You certainly won't learn
from an old fucker like me.

763
00:58:03.813 --> 00:58:06.774
Even if I did know,
I wouldn't tell a pissant like you.

764
00:58:07.566 --> 00:58:09.484
Yeah, why not?

765
00:58:09.568 --> 00:58:13.321
You told me every other fuckin' thing.
Jesus Christ.

766
00:58:13.406 --> 00:58:16.158
Fuckin' talk more than
any shrink I ever seen in my life.

767
00:58:16.242 --> 00:58:20.287
I teach the shit.
I didn't say I knew how to do it.

768
00:58:20.371 --> 00:58:22.331
Yeah.

769
00:58:26.711 --> 00:58:30.715
- You ever think about gettin' remarried?
- My wife's dead.

770
00:58:30.798 --> 00:58:33.884
- Hence the word “remarried.”
- She's dead.

771
00:58:36.554 --> 00:58:39.807
Yeah, well, I think
that's a super philosophy, Sean.

772
00:58:39.890 --> 00:58:42.058
That way, you can actually go
through the rest of your life...

773
00:58:42.143 --> 00:58:44.770
without ever really knowing anybody.

774
00:58:47.231 --> 00:58:49.399
Time's up.

775
00:59:03.914 --> 00:59:06.166
- Hold it open.
- Okay.

776
00:59:06.250 --> 00:59:08.669
Thanks.

777
00:59:20.973 --> 00:59:24.726
<i>I am happy with you</i>

778
00:59:24.810 --> 00:59:28.814
<i>I know I'm about
to love you</i>

779
00:59:28.898 --> 00:59:33.398
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah
You know him</i>

780
00:59:34.195 --> 00:59:37.573
<i>Oh, my, you made me—</i>

781
00:59:37.656 --> 00:59:40.950
“G” minor seventh. Saddest of all chords.

782
00:59:42.286 --> 00:59:44.204
- Hello.
- Hey.

783
00:59:44.288 --> 00:59:48.542
- Where have you been?
- I'm sorry. I've been really busy, and—

784
00:59:48.626 --> 00:59:51.211
- But—
- Me too.

785
00:59:51.295 --> 00:59:55.215
Yeah. I thought you'd call.

786
00:59:55.299 --> 00:59:57.426
Yeah.

787
00:59:57.510 --> 01:00:00.846
- We had a really good time.
- I had a really good time too.

788
01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:03.098
I mean, I just—

789
01:00:03.182 --> 01:00:05.309
I'm sorry, you know. I blew it.

790
01:00:05.392 --> 01:00:07.519
No. No, it's all right.

791
01:00:07.603 --> 01:00:10.731
Yeah, so, I was wonderin' if...

792
01:00:10.815 --> 01:00:12.775
if you know, you'd give me
another crack at it.

793
01:00:12.858 --> 01:00:15.402
Let me take you out again.

794
01:00:15.486 --> 01:00:18.155
- I can't.
- All right.

795
01:00:18.239 --> 01:00:21.617
Oh, no, I didn't mean I can't, like, ever.

796
01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:23.660
I just can't right now.

797
01:00:23.744 --> 01:00:26.747
I've got to assign
the proton spectrum for “ebogamine.”

798
01:00:26.831 --> 01:00:30.835
Although it sounds really, really interesting.
It's actually fantastically boring.

799
01:00:30.918 --> 01:00:33.754
- All right.
- Maybe some other time.

800
01:00:33.838 --> 01:00:37.883
- Like tomorrow?
- Yeah, all right.

801
01:00:37.967 --> 01:00:40.386
- Okay.
- Okay.

802
01:00:40.469 --> 01:00:42.846
- Bye.
- Bye.

803
01:00:54.567 --> 01:00:57.069
What are you doing here?

804
01:00:57.153 --> 01:00:59.405
I couldn't wait till tomorrow.

805
01:01:00.739 --> 01:01:02.449
Where the fuck did you get this?

806
01:01:02.533 --> 01:01:04.618
I had to sleep with someone in your class.

807
01:01:04.702 --> 01:01:08.539
I hope it was the one with the open-toed
sandals and the really bad breath.

808
01:01:10.416 --> 01:01:14.336
- Come on. Let's go have some fun.
- No, I've got to learn this.

809
01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:17.089
You're not going into
surgery tomorrow, are you?

810
01:01:17.173 --> 01:01:19.175
- No.
- Let's go.

811
01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:26.723
Oh, my God! My dog is winning!

812
01:01:26.807 --> 01:01:29.100
Come on, Misty!

813
01:01:29.185 --> 01:01:31.896
Come on! Run!
Look at that! Come on!

814
01:01:31.979 --> 01:01:33.897
Look, there he goes. Misty, run! Come on!

815
01:01:36.233 --> 01:01:40.445
- We won.
- He totally won.

816
01:01:42.364 --> 01:01:44.616
So did you grow up around here then?

817
01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:46.910
Not far. South Boston.

818
01:01:49.496 --> 01:01:51.414
Still glowing from my win.

819
01:01:51.498 --> 01:01:53.416
Look at you. You're so happy.

820
01:01:55.211 --> 01:01:57.254
And what was that like then?

821
01:01:57.338 --> 01:02:00.966
It was normal, I guess. Nothin' special.

822
01:02:02.426 --> 01:02:04.219
Do you got lots of brothers and sisters?

823
01:02:04.303 --> 01:02:07.514
- Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?
- That's what I said.

824
01:02:07.598 --> 01:02:12.098
- Irish Catholic, what do you think?
- Right. That's right.

825
01:02:13.270 --> 01:02:16.773
- How many?
- You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

826
01:02:18.275 --> 01:02:21.820
- Why? Go on. What? Five?
- No.

827
01:02:21.904 --> 01:02:25.157
Seven? Eight? How many?

828
01:02:25.241 --> 01:02:27.409
- I have 12 big brothers.
- You do not!

829
01:02:27.493 --> 01:02:30.329
No, I swear to God.
I swear to God. I'm lucky 13 right here.

830
01:02:30.412 --> 01:02:32.330
Do you know all their names?

831
01:02:32.414 --> 01:02:34.999
Do I- Yeah, they're my brothers.

832
01:02:35.084 --> 01:02:37.169
What are they called?

833
01:02:37.253 --> 01:02:41.590
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey,
Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny and Brian.

834
01:02:41.674 --> 01:02:44.093
Say it again.

835
01:02:44.176 --> 01:02:48.305
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey,
Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny and Brian.

836
01:02:49.974 --> 01:02:50.975
And Willy.

837
01:02:51.058 --> 01:02:52.350
- Willy?
- Yeah.

838
01:02:52.434 --> 01:02:53.977
- Will.
- Wow.

839
01:02:55.312 --> 01:02:57.814
- Do you still see all of them?
- Yeah, they all live in Southie.

840
01:02:57.898 --> 01:02:59.774
- I'm livin' with three of 'em right now.
- Oh, yeah?

841
01:02:59.858 --> 01:03:02.026
- Yeah.
- I'd like to meet them.

842
01:03:02.111 --> 01:03:04.404
Yeah, we'll do that.

843
01:03:04.655 --> 01:03:07.074
I read your book last night.

844
01:03:07.157 --> 01:03:09.701
Oh, so you're the one.

845
01:03:09.785 --> 01:03:13.079
- Do you still counsel veterans?
- No, I don't.

846
01:03:13.163 --> 01:03:15.331
- Why not?
- I gave it up when my wife got sick.

847
01:03:17.918 --> 01:03:22.418
You ever wonder what your life
would be like if you never met your wife?

848
01:03:23.507 --> 01:03:25.467
What? Wonder if I'd be
better off without her?

849
01:03:25.551 --> 01:03:27.636
- No, no, I'm not saying, like, better off.
- No.

850
01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:31.724
- I didn't mean it like that.
- It's all right. It's an important question.

851
01:03:31.807 --> 01:03:34.059
'Cause you'll have bad times,
but that'll always wake you up...

852
01:03:34.143 --> 01:03:36.395
to the good stuff you weren't
paying attention to.

853
01:03:36.478 --> 01:03:39.063
And you don't regret meetin' your wife?

854
01:03:39.148 --> 01:03:41.817
Why? 'Cause the pain I feel now?

855
01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:46.321
I got regrets, Will, but I don't
regret a single day I spent with her.

856
01:03:51.744 --> 01:03:54.496
So when did you know
that she was the one for you?

857
01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:57.291
October 21, 1975.

858
01:03:57.374 --> 01:03:59.459
Jesus Christ. You know the fuckin' day?

859
01:03:59.543 --> 01:04:03.129
Oh, yeah, 'cause it was game six
of the World Series...

860
01:04:03.213 --> 01:04:04.547
biggest game in Red Sox history?

861
01:04:04.631 --> 01:04:05.882
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>

862
01:04:05.966 --> 01:04:09.719
<i>My friends and I had slept out
all night to get tickets.</i>

863
01:04:09.803 --> 01:04:13.264
- You got tickets?
- Yep. Day of the game we're was sittin' in a bar...

864
01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:16.852
<i>waitin' for the game to start
and in walks this girl.</i>

865
01:04:16.935 --> 01:04:20.271
It was an amazing game though.
Bottom of the eighth, Carbo ties it up.

866
01:04:20.356 --> 01:04:22.483
It was 6-6. It went to 12.

867
01:04:22.566 --> 01:04:26.361
<i>Bottom of the 12th,
in stepped Carlton Fisk, old Pudge.</i>

868
01:04:26.445 --> 01:04:28.530
<i>Steps up to the plate.
He's got that weird stance.</i>

869
01:04:28.614 --> 01:04:32.200
- Yeah, yeah.
- And then— Boom! He clocks it, you know.

870
01:04:32.284 --> 01:04:34.953
High fly ball down the left field line!

871
01:04:35.037 --> 01:04:37.581
35,000 people on their feet,
yellin' at the ball.

872
01:04:37.664 --> 01:04:40.166
<i>But that's nothin', 'cause Fisk, he's
wavin' at the ball like a madman.</i>

873
01:04:40.250 --> 01:04:42.168
- Yeah, I've seen that.
- “Get over! Get over!

874
01:04:42.252 --> 01:04:43.670
- Right.
- Get over!”

875
01:04:43.754 --> 01:04:48.133
<i>Then it hits the foul pole.
He goes ape-shit, and 35,000 fans—</i>

876
01:04:48.217 --> 01:04:50.302
<i>They charge the field, you know.</i>

877
01:04:50.386 --> 01:04:52.721
Yeah, and he's fuckin' blowin'
people outta the way.

878
01:04:52.805 --> 01:04:54.932
“Get outta the way! Get outta the way!”

879
01:04:55.015 --> 01:04:57.308
I can't fuckin' believe you had tickets
to that fuckin' game!

880
01:04:57.393 --> 01:05:01.313
- Did you rush the field?
- No, I didn't rush the fuckin' field. I wasn't there.

881
01:05:01.397 --> 01:05:02.356
What?

882
01:05:02.439 --> 01:05:04.399
No, I was in a bar, havin'
a drink with my future wife.

883
01:05:04.483 --> 01:05:08.983
You missed Pudge Fisk's home run to have
a fuckin' drink with some lady you never met?

884
01:05:09.154 --> 01:05:11.364
Yeah, but you should have seen her.
She was a stunner.

885
01:05:11.448 --> 01:05:13.950
- I don't care if—
- Oh, no, she lit up the room.

886
01:05:14.034 --> 01:05:16.995
- I don't care if Helen of Troy walks into the room.
- Oh, Helen of Troy!

887
01:05:17.079 --> 01:05:19.206
That's game six! Oh, my God,
and who were these friends of yours?

888
01:05:19.289 --> 01:05:21.582
- They let you get away with that?
- They had to.

889
01:05:21.667 --> 01:05:25.253
- What did you say to 'em?
- I just slid my ticket across the table.

890
01:05:25.337 --> 01:05:28.423
I said, “Sorry, guys.
I gotta see about a girl.”

891
01:05:28.507 --> 01:05:30.675
- “I gotta go see about a girl”?
- Yes!

892
01:05:30.759 --> 01:05:32.719
That's what you said?
They let you get away with that?

893
01:05:32.803 --> 01:05:34.930
Oh, yeah. They saw
in my eyes that I meant it.

894
01:05:35.013 --> 01:05:38.808
- You're kiddin' me?
- No, I'm not kidding you, Will.

895
01:05:38.892 --> 01:05:41.561
That's why I'm not talkin' right now about
some girl I saw at a bar 20 years ago...

896
01:05:41.645 --> 01:05:44.022
and how I always regretted not goin' over
and talkin' to her.

897
01:05:44.106 --> 01:05:47.275
I don't regret the 18 years
I was married to Nancy.

898
01:05:47.359 --> 01:05:50.403
I don't regret the six years I had to
give up counseling when she got sick...

899
01:05:50.487 --> 01:05:53.198
and I don't regret the last years
when she got really sick.

900
01:05:54.324 --> 01:05:56.909
And I sure as hell don't
regret missin' a damn game.

901
01:05:56.994 --> 01:05:59.705
That's regret.

902
01:05:59.788 --> 01:06:02.040
Wow!

903
01:06:07.838 --> 01:06:09.714
Would have been nice
to catch that game though.

904
01:06:09.798 --> 01:06:12.342
I didn't know Pudge
was gonna hit a home run.

905
01:06:14.428 --> 01:06:18.473
You know, I'm very, very
useful on the court.

906
01:06:18.557 --> 01:06:21.643
I'm extremely tall.

907
01:06:21.727 --> 01:06:24.604
- You're not that tall.
- I dunk.

908
01:06:27.524 --> 01:06:30.693
Will I ever play in the N.B.A.?

909
01:06:30.777 --> 01:06:32.695
“It is decidedly so.”

910
01:06:36.783 --> 01:06:39.452
Why do we always stay here?

911
01:06:39.536 --> 01:06:42.121
'Cause it's nicer than my place.

912
01:06:42.206 --> 01:06:44.708
Yes, but I've never seen your place.

913
01:06:44.791 --> 01:06:47.001
I know.

914
01:06:47.085 --> 01:06:49.545
When am I gonna meet
your friends and your brothers?

915
01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:53.091
They don't really
come down here that much.

916
01:06:53.175 --> 01:06:55.302
I think I can make it to South Boston.

917
01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:58.972
It's kind of a hike.

918
01:06:59.056 --> 01:07:03.143
Is it me you're hiding from them
or the other way around?

919
01:07:03.227 --> 01:07:05.729
- All right, we'll go.
- When?

920
01:07:05.812 --> 01:07:08.231
I don't know. We'll go sometime next week.

921
01:07:08.315 --> 01:07:12.815
What if I said I would not sleep with you
again until you let me meet your friends?

922
01:07:19.409 --> 01:07:23.079
I'd say it's 4:30 in the mornin'.
They're probably up.

923
01:07:23.163 --> 01:07:26.416
Oh, my God. Men are shameless.

924
01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:29.836
If you're not thinking with your wiener,
then you're acting directly on its behalf.

925
01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:34.420
You bet. And on behalf of my wiener,
can I get an advance payment?

926
01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:39.012
I don't know. Let's ask.
“Outlook does not look good.”

927
01:07:39.096 --> 01:07:40.055
What?

928
01:07:40.138 --> 01:07:42.682
Fuck the— Hey, Chuck.
No. Nothing. Go back to sleep.

929
01:07:42.766 --> 01:07:46.019
“Outlook”? That's the same thing that told you
you was gonna play in the N.B.A.

930
01:07:46.103 --> 01:07:49.272
Exactly, so look out. You'd better start
buying some season tickets.

931
01:07:51.650 --> 01:07:55.028
I plan to. I'm tall.
I like wearing shorts.

932
01:07:55.112 --> 01:07:57.322
Hook, hook. Dunk, dunk.

933
01:07:57.406 --> 01:08:00.200
- You're not that tall.
- Yes, I am.

934
01:08:00.284 --> 01:08:01.952
Maybe I'm all about three points.

935
01:08:03.370 --> 01:08:05.622
I'm all about home runs.

936
01:08:05.706 --> 01:08:09.000
Stop mixing your sporting metaphors.

937
01:08:21.346 --> 01:08:22.263
A leprechaun's got his dick
in the monkey's ass.

938
01:08:22.264 --> 01:08:22.347
A leprechaun's got his dick
in the monkey's ass.

939
01:08:22.347 --> 01:08:25.058
A leprechaun's got his dick
in the monkey's ass.

940
01:08:25.142 --> 01:08:28.854
Morgan comes runnin' in,
goin', “I don't mind it. I don't mind-"

941
01:08:30.939 --> 01:08:34.609
I can't believe you brought Skylar here
when we're fuckin' all bombed and drinkin'.

942
01:08:34.693 --> 01:08:37.195
I know, Morgan.
It's a real rarity we be all drinkin'.

943
01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:40.907
My uncle Marty drinks. He'll go on
a bender for six, eight months.

944
01:08:40.991 --> 01:08:43.827
Did I ever tell ya what happened to him
when he was drivin' and got pulled over?

945
01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:46.203
- I told you guys, right?
- Marty, yeah.

946
01:08:46.288 --> 01:08:49.874
Let me tell ya what happened to my
uncle Marty, because you oughta know this.

947
01:08:49.958 --> 01:08:53.294
He's always tellin' stories. Every time
we come here he's got another story.

948
01:08:53.378 --> 01:08:57.382
But we all heard this one.
Go ahead. Say it anyway.

949
01:08:57.466 --> 01:09:01.966
I will go ahead. Thanks a lot.
Guess I have the floor now.

950
01:09:02.679 --> 01:09:05.306
My uncle Marty's drivin' home, right?

951
01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:09.890
Bombed out of his tree, right?
Just hammered out of his gourd. Just wrecked.

952
01:09:10.228 --> 01:09:14.357
This state trooper sees him, pulls him over.
So my uncle's fucked basically.

953
01:09:14.441 --> 01:09:16.651
Got him out of the car,
tryin' to make him walk the line.

954
01:09:16.735 --> 01:09:20.572
He gets out of the car, pukes, and the statie's
pretty sure he's over the legal limit.

955
01:09:20.656 --> 01:09:24.451
So he's about to throw the cuffs on him
and put him in jail.

956
01:09:24.534 --> 01:09:28.621
All of a sudden, 50 yards down the road,
there's this huge fuckin' boom.

957
01:09:28.705 --> 01:09:32.166
- Statie gets real spooked. He turns around—
- A gunshot?

958
01:09:32.250 --> 01:09:35.211
No. You heard this story before.

959
01:09:35.295 --> 01:09:37.213
Yeah, Morgan, stop. Stop.

960
01:09:37.297 --> 01:09:40.591
Some other guy's car had hit a tree.
There was an accident.

961
01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:42.636
Anyway—

962
01:09:42.719 --> 01:09:44.804
- How could he hear—
- Shut the fuck up!

963
01:09:44.888 --> 01:09:47.849
- You're drivin' him nuts.
- I'm gonna break your neck. Shut up!

964
01:09:47.933 --> 01:09:49.893
He told you the story once before.

965
01:09:49.976 --> 01:09:52.645
So he tells my uncle,
“Stay here. Don't move.”

966
01:09:52.729 --> 01:09:56.649
Statie goes runnin' down the road to deal
with the other accident.

967
01:09:56.733 --> 01:10:00.653
After a few minutes of just lyin'
in his own piss and vomit...

968
01:10:00.737 --> 01:10:02.739
my uncle starts wonderin'
what he's doin' there.

969
01:10:02.823 --> 01:10:05.325
Gets up, gets in his car
and just drives home.

970
01:10:05.409 --> 01:10:08.412
The next mornin'
my uncle's just passed out.

971
01:10:08.495 --> 01:10:10.747
He hears this knockin' at the door.

972
01:10:10.831 --> 01:10:13.750
So he goes downstairs,
pulls the door open— “What?”

973
01:10:13.834 --> 01:10:15.794
It's the state trooper
that pulled him over.

974
01:10:15.877 --> 01:10:17.795
Statie says, “Fuck you mean, 'What?'

975
01:10:17.879 --> 01:10:21.382
You know what. I pulled you over
last night is what, and you took off.”

976
01:10:21.466 --> 01:10:24.010
He's like, “I never
seen you before in my life.

977
01:10:24.094 --> 01:10:26.805
I've been home all night with my kids.
I don't know who the fuck you are.”

978
01:10:26.888 --> 01:10:30.182
He's like, “You know who I am.
Let me in your garage.”

979
01:10:30.267 --> 01:10:32.602
My uncle's like, “What?” He said,
“You heard me. Let me in your garage.”

980
01:10:32.686 --> 01:10:35.355
He was like, “All right. Fine.” Takes him
out to the garage, opens the door.

981
01:10:35.439 --> 01:10:39.939
And there's— The statie's police cruiser
is in my uncle's garage.

982
01:10:40.694 --> 01:10:43.196
He was so fuckin'—

983
01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:45.699
He was so fuckin' hammered
he drove the wrong car home.

984
01:10:45.782 --> 01:10:49.535
The best part about it is,
the fuckin' state trooper...

985
01:10:49.619 --> 01:10:52.038
was so embarrassed he didn't do anything.

986
01:10:52.122 --> 01:10:55.458
He'd been drivin' around all night in
my uncle's Chevelle, lookin' for the house.

987
01:10:55.542 --> 01:10:59.546
All right, Chuck,
what the fuck is the point of your story?

988
01:10:59.629 --> 01:11:01.881
He got away. That's the point.

989
01:11:01.965 --> 01:11:05.093
- Question—
- Come on. Stop.

990
01:11:05.177 --> 01:11:07.971
- I'm tryin' to clarify somethin',
- You're embarrassing,.

991
01:11:08.054 --> 01:11:10.556
- It doesn't make any sense.
- It does make sense...

992
01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:12.558
if you listen to the story
and quit askin' questions.

993
01:11:12.642 --> 01:11:15.978
Morgan, let's see if you can get this one.
I've got a little story for you.

994
01:11:16.062 --> 01:11:20.562
All right, there's an old couple in bed,
Mary and Paddie.

995
01:11:20.859 --> 01:11:25.359
They wake up on the morning
of their 50th anniversary.

996
01:11:26.490 --> 01:11:29.618
Mary looks over and
gazes adoringly at Paddie.

997
01:11:29.701 --> 01:11:31.744
She's like, “Oh, Jesus, Paddie.

998
01:11:31.828 --> 01:11:34.080
You're such a good-looking feller.
I love ya.

999
01:11:34.164 --> 01:11:36.541
I want to give ya a little present.

1000
01:11:36.625 --> 01:11:39.586
Anything your little heart desires,
I'm goin' to give it to ya.

1001
01:11:39.669 --> 01:11:41.545
What would ya like?”

1002
01:11:41.630 --> 01:11:46.130
Paddie's like, “Oh, gee, Mary.
That's a very sweet offer.

1003
01:11:46.384 --> 01:11:50.884
Now, in 50 years,
there's one thing that's been missing...

1004
01:11:51.389 --> 01:11:55.142
and I would like you
to give me a blow job.

1005
01:11:55.227 --> 01:11:58.897
I would like one.”
Mary's like, “All right.”

1006
01:11:58.980 --> 01:12:03.442
She takes her teeth out, puts 'em in the glass.
She gives him a blow job.

1007
01:12:03.527 --> 01:12:07.447
Afterwards, Paddie's like, “Yeah, geez,
now that's what I've been missin'.

1008
01:12:07.531 --> 01:12:11.409
That was the most beautiful,
earth-shattering thing ever!

1009
01:12:11.493 --> 01:12:13.786
Beautiful, Mary! I love ya!

1010
01:12:13.870 --> 01:12:16.789
Is there anything that I can do for you?”

1011
01:12:16.873 --> 01:12:21.373
Mary looks up to him and she goes,
“Give us a kiss.”

1012
01:12:21.586 --> 01:12:23.879
Oh, my God!

1013
01:12:23.964 --> 01:12:27.384
- That's filthy.
- It's not that filthy. I've heard filthier.

1014
01:12:31.763 --> 01:12:35.767
- Get off of me!
- All right. See you guys later.

1015
01:12:35.851 --> 01:12:37.769
All right. Take it easy, Bill.

1016
01:12:39.187 --> 01:12:41.647
So, Skylar, thanks for comin' by.

1017
01:12:41.731 --> 01:12:43.649
Changed my opinion of Harvard people.

1018
01:12:43.733 --> 01:12:47.194
You don't want to rush to judgment on that one,
'cause they're not all like me.

1019
01:12:47.279 --> 01:12:49.990
I'm sure. It was nice to meet ya.

1020
01:12:50.073 --> 01:12:52.742
Take it easy. Slowly back away.

1021
01:12:52.826 --> 01:12:56.913
- Oh, come on. Brother.
- I don't know what you're doin', dude.

1022
01:12:56.997 --> 01:12:59.666
- You're givin' us a ride.
- What the fuck do I look like to you?

1023
01:12:59.749 --> 01:13:03.169
- Come on, Chuck.
- You're walkin', bitch. Will's takin' the car.

1024
01:13:03.253 --> 01:13:06.464
All right, thanks, sucker.
I appreciate it.

1025
01:13:06.548 --> 01:13:09.425
I don't know what
you're gettin' all serious about.

1026
01:13:09.509 --> 01:13:13.387
- You're droppin' me off first.
- It's really out of the way.

1027
01:13:13.471 --> 01:13:16.348
Oh, okay. Just cause you don't have to
sleep in your one-room palace tonight...

1028
01:13:16.433 --> 01:13:18.351
don't start thinkin' you're bad.

1029
01:13:18.435 --> 01:13:20.687
Hey, wait a minute.
You said we were gonna see your place.

1030
01:13:20.770 --> 01:13:23.898
- Not tonight.
- Oh, no, not tonight. Not any other night.

1031
01:13:23.982 --> 01:13:27.568
He knows once you see that shit-hole,
he's gettin' dropped like a bad habit.

1032
01:13:27.652 --> 01:13:29.695
But I wanted to meet your brothers.

1033
01:13:29.779 --> 01:13:32.198
We're gonna do that another time.

1034
01:13:32.282 --> 01:13:34.200
All right.

1035
01:13:36.077 --> 01:13:38.370
Need them keys.

1036
01:13:38.455 --> 01:13:42.500
The stewardess hears this,
and goes haulin' ass down the aisle.

1037
01:13:42.584 --> 01:13:45.878
I yell, “Don't forget the coffee.”

1038
01:13:45.962 --> 01:13:48.005
Bullshit! You didn't say that.

1039
01:13:48.089 --> 01:13:50.466
For Christ's sake, Marty, it's a joke.

1040
01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:52.718
- I know someone that actually happened to.
- A joke.

1041
01:13:52.802 --> 01:13:54.386
- Gerry.
- Hi

1042
01:13:54.471 --> 01:13:56.389
- Have trouble findin' the place?
- No, I took a cab.

1043
01:13:56.473 --> 01:14:00.351
Timmy, this is Gerry.
We went to college together.

1044
01:14:00.435 --> 01:14:02.562
How you doin'? Nice to meet ya.

1045
01:14:02.646 --> 01:14:04.564
- Pleased to meet you.
- Can I get you a beer?

1046
01:14:04.648 --> 01:14:07.108
No, just a Perrier.

1047
01:14:07.192 --> 01:14:09.110
That's French for club soda.

1048
01:14:09.194 --> 01:14:11.779
- Club soda, yeah.
- Couple of sandwiches too.

1049
01:14:11.863 --> 01:14:13.781
- Sure.
- Put it on my tab.

1050
01:14:13.865 --> 01:14:16.117
You ever plannin' on payin' your tab?

1051
01:14:16.201 --> 01:14:18.411
Yeah, chief, got the winning
lottery ticket right here.

1052
01:14:18.495 --> 01:14:20.121
- What's the jackpot?
- Twelve million.

1053
01:14:20.205 --> 01:14:23.833
- I don't think that'll cover it.
- It'll cover your sex change operation.

1054
01:14:28.338 --> 01:14:30.673
- Nuts?
- No, thank you.

1055
01:14:34.761 --> 01:14:37.847
So, you wanted to talk about Will.

1056
01:14:37.931 --> 01:14:41.809
- It seems to be going well.
- I think so.

1057
01:14:43.186 --> 01:14:46.022
Have you talked to him
at all about his future?

1058
01:14:46.106 --> 01:14:49.776
No, we haven't gotten into that yet.
We're still bangin' away at the past.

1059
01:14:49.859 --> 01:14:53.404
Maybe you should. My phone's been ringing
off the hook with job offers.

1060
01:14:53.488 --> 01:14:57.366
- What kind?
- Cutting edge mathematics, think tanks.

1061
01:14:57.450 --> 01:15:00.786
The kind of place where a mind like Will's
is given free rein.

1062
01:15:00.870 --> 01:15:05.370
That's great that there are offers, but I
don't really think he's ready for that.

1063
01:15:10.255 --> 01:15:12.423
I'm not sure you understand, Sean.

1064
01:15:12.507 --> 01:15:15.259
- What don't I understand?
- Here you go, guys.

1065
01:15:15.343 --> 01:15:18.554
- Thanks, Tim.
- Yeah, thank you.

1066
01:15:18.638 --> 01:15:20.931
Just so you don't get sticky fingers.

1067
01:15:21.016 --> 01:15:23.476
Tim, can you help us?

1068
01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:26.020
We're tryin' to settle a bet.

1069
01:15:27.522 --> 01:15:30.942
- Ever heard of Jonas Salk?
- Sure. Cured polio.

1070
01:15:31.026 --> 01:15:33.737
- Ever heard of Albert Einstein?
- Hey.

1071
01:15:35.989 --> 01:15:39.200
How about Gerald Lambeau?
Ever heard of him?

1072
01:15:39.284 --> 01:15:42.996
- No.
- Thank you, Tim.

1073
01:15:43.079 --> 01:15:45.039
- So who won the bet?
- I did.

1074
01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:51.504
This isn't about me, Sean.

1075
01:15:51.588 --> 01:15:54.424
I'm nothing compared to this young man.

1076
01:15:57.927 --> 01:15:59.845
You ever hear of Gerald Lambeau?

1077
01:15:59.929 --> 01:16:04.429
In 1905, there were hundreds of professors
renowned for their study of the universe.

1078
01:16:04.684 --> 01:16:09.184
But it was a 26-year-old
Swiss patent clerk...

1079
01:16:09.272 --> 01:16:11.899
doing physics in his spare time,
who changed the world.

1080
01:16:11.983 --> 01:16:13.901
Can you imagine if Einstein
would have given that up...

1081
01:16:13.985 --> 01:16:16.487
just to get drunk with his buddies
in Vienna every night?

1082
01:16:16.571 --> 01:16:19.198
We all would have lost something.

1083
01:16:19.282 --> 01:16:21.284
Tim would never have heard of him.

1084
01:16:21.367 --> 01:16:24.453
- Pretty dramatic, Gerry.
- No, it isn't, Sean.

1085
01:16:24.537 --> 01:16:27.122
This boy has that gift.

1086
01:16:27.207 --> 01:16:29.667
He just hasn't got the direction,
but we can give that to him.

1087
01:16:29.751 --> 01:16:34.251
Hey, Gerry, in the 1960s, there was a young man
graduated from University of Michigan.

1088
01:16:35.131 --> 01:16:38.384
Did some brilliant work in mathematics.

1089
01:16:38.468 --> 01:16:40.887
Specifically, bounded harmonic functions.

1090
01:16:40.970 --> 01:16:44.056
Then he went on to Berkeley. He was
assistant professor. Showed amazing potential.

1091
01:16:44.140 --> 01:16:47.017
Then he moved to Montana, and
he blew the competition away.

1092
01:16:47.102 --> 01:16:50.021
- Yeah, so who was he?
- Ted Kaczynski.

1093
01:16:50.105 --> 01:16:51.981
Haven't heard of him.

1094
01:16:52.065 --> 01:16:53.983
- Hey, Timmy!
- Yo!

1095
01:16:54.067 --> 01:16:56.819
- Who's Ted Kaczynski?
- Unabomber.

1096
01:16:59.781 --> 01:17:01.824
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

1097
01:17:01.908 --> 01:17:03.826
- We gotta give this kid direction.
- Yeah—

1098
01:17:03.910 --> 01:17:06.245
He can contribute to the world,
and we can help him do that.

1099
01:17:06.329 --> 01:17:08.372
Direction's one thing.
Manipulation's another.

1100
01:17:08.456 --> 01:17:10.416
- Sean—
- We have to let him find—

1101
01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:14.128
I'm not sitting at home every night
twisting my mustache and hatching a plan...

1102
01:17:14.212 --> 01:17:16.172
to ruin this boy's life!

1103
01:17:16.256 --> 01:17:18.633
I was doing advanced mathematics
when I was 18...

1104
01:17:18.716 --> 01:17:21.176
and it still took me over 20 years to do
something worthy of a Field's medal.

1105
01:17:21.261 --> 01:17:23.680
Maybe he doesn't want what you want.

1106
01:17:23.763 --> 01:17:26.515
There's more to life
than a fuckin' Field's medal.

1107
01:17:26.599 --> 01:17:30.519
This is too important, Sean,
and it's above personal rivalry.

1108
01:17:30.603 --> 01:17:33.022
Wait a minute. Let's talk about the boy.

1109
01:17:33.106 --> 01:17:35.817
Why don't we give him time
to figure out what he wants?

1110
01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:39.153
That's a wonderful theory, Sean.
It worked wonders for you, didn't it?

1111
01:17:39.237 --> 01:17:41.864
Yeah, it did, you arrogant fuckin' prick!

1112
01:17:43.283 --> 01:17:46.703
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry
that I came here today.

1113
01:17:46.786 --> 01:17:48.913
I came here out of courtesy.
I wanted to keep you in the loop.

1114
01:17:48.997 --> 01:17:51.124
Nice to be in the loop.

1115
01:17:51.207 --> 01:17:54.710
The boy's in a meeting
right now I set up for him over at McNeil.

1116
01:17:54.961 --> 01:17:59.298
Will, I'm not exactly sure
what you mean.

1117
01:17:59.382 --> 01:18:01.759
We've already offered you a position.

1118
01:18:01.843 --> 01:18:03.845
Nobody in this town works
without a retainer, guys.

1119
01:18:03.928 --> 01:18:07.181
You think you can find somebody who does,
you have my blessin'.

1120
01:18:07.265 --> 01:18:10.518
But I think we all know that person is not
gonna represent you as well as I can.

1121
01:18:10.602 --> 01:18:13.730
Will, our offer is $84,000 a year.

1122
01:18:13.813 --> 01:18:18.313
Retainer! Retainer.

1123
01:18:18.610 --> 01:18:21.362
You want us to give you cash right now?

1124
01:18:21.446 --> 01:18:25.491
Whoa-ho-ho. Easy— Now, I didn't say that.

1125
01:18:25.575 --> 01:18:30.075
Allegedly, your situation, for you...

1126
01:18:30.914 --> 01:18:34.709
would be concurrently improved if I had...

1127
01:18:34.792 --> 01:18:37.461
$200 in my back pocket right now.

1128
01:18:37.545 --> 01:18:42.045
I don't think I can— Larry?

1129
01:18:42.634 --> 01:18:46.804
- I've got $73.
- Will you take a check?

1130
01:18:48.431 --> 01:18:51.684
Let me tell you somethin'. You're suspect.

1131
01:18:51.768 --> 01:18:56.268
Yeah, you. I don't know
what your reputation is in this town...

1132
01:18:57.148 --> 01:18:59.859
but after the shit
you tried to pull today...

1133
01:18:59.943 --> 01:19:02.528
you can bet I'll be lookin' into you.

1134
01:19:02.612 --> 01:19:07.112
Now, any business we have heretofore...

1135
01:19:07.617 --> 01:19:10.286
you can speak with
my aforementioned attorney.

1136
01:19:11.496 --> 01:19:13.664
Good day, gentlemen.

1137
01:19:13.748 --> 01:19:17.460
And until that day comes,
keep your ear to the grindstone.

1138
01:19:31.808 --> 01:19:33.726
- How's it goin'?
- Fine.

1139
01:19:33.810 --> 01:19:35.853
Yeah.

1140
01:19:35.937 --> 01:19:37.855
Good.

1141
01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:41.567
- Want some help?
- No!

1142
01:19:41.651 --> 01:19:44.820
Come on. Give me one little peek, and
we'll go to the batting cages.

1143
01:19:44.904 --> 01:19:47.072
No.

1144
01:19:47.156 --> 01:19:50.826
It is actually important
that I learn this.

1145
01:19:50.910 --> 01:19:54.663
- It's really important... to me, okay?
- All right.

1146
01:19:54.747 --> 01:19:59.247
- Why don't we just hang out here all day?
- Yes, why don't we?

1147
01:20:02.046 --> 01:20:05.716
All right, Mr. Nosey Parker.

1148
01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:08.761
Seeing as you're intent
on breaking my balls...

1149
01:20:10.638 --> 01:20:14.224
- let me ask you a question.
- All right.

1150
01:20:14.309 --> 01:20:16.227
Do you have a photographic memory?

1151
01:20:18.438 --> 01:20:22.316
I don't know. I just kind of remember.
How do you remember your phone number?

1152
01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:24.318
You just do.

1153
01:20:24.402 --> 01:20:27.279
- Have you studied organic chemistry?
- A little bit.

1154
01:20:27.363 --> 01:20:30.282
- Oh, just for fun?
- Yeah, for kicks.

1155
01:20:30.366 --> 01:20:32.910
Yeah, it's so much fun
studying organic chemistry.

1156
01:20:32.994 --> 01:20:35.621
Are you mad?

1157
01:20:35.705 --> 01:20:38.207
Have you completely lost your mind?

1158
01:20:38.291 --> 01:20:42.791
Nobody studies it for fun. It's not a necessity,
especially for someone like you.

1159
01:20:42.962 --> 01:20:45.422
- Someone like me?
- Yeah.

1160
01:20:45.506 --> 01:20:49.760
Someone who divides their time, fairly
evenly, between batting cages and bars.

1161
01:20:49.844 --> 01:20:54.344
I would hardly say it was a necessity.

1162
01:20:54.432 --> 01:20:57.226
You know, there are very
smart people here at Harvard.

1163
01:20:57.310 --> 01:21:01.272
Even they have to study,
because this is really hard.

1164
01:21:01.356 --> 01:21:05.856
And yet... you do it so easily.
I don't understand.

1165
01:21:07.111 --> 01:21:09.154
I don't understand how your mind works.

1166
01:21:09.238 --> 01:21:11.490
- Do you play the piano?
- I want to talk about this.

1167
01:21:11.574 --> 01:21:13.701
No, I'm trying to explain it to you.
Do you play the piano?

1168
01:21:13.785 --> 01:21:18.285
- Yeah, a bit.
- So when you look at a piano, you see Mozart.

1169
01:21:18.414 --> 01:21:22.000
- I see “Chopsticks.”
- All right, Beethoven, okay?

1170
01:21:22.085 --> 01:21:25.838
He looked at a piano, and it just made
sense to him. He could just play.

1171
01:21:25.922 --> 01:21:28.341
- So what are you saying? You play the piano?
- Not a lick.

1172
01:21:28.424 --> 01:21:32.261
I look at a piano, I see a bunch of keys,
three pedals and a box of wood.

1173
01:21:32.345 --> 01:21:36.845
But Beethoven, Mozart—
They saw it. They could just play.

1174
01:21:37.225 --> 01:21:41.187
I couldn't paint you a picture. I probably
can't hit the ball out of Fenway.

1175
01:21:41.270 --> 01:21:42.771
And I can't play the piano.

1176
01:21:42.855 --> 01:21:45.357
But you can do my
O-chem paper in under an hour.

1177
01:21:46.776 --> 01:21:50.780
Right. When it came to stuff like that,
I could always just play.

1178
01:21:53.658 --> 01:21:55.618
That's the best I can explain it.

1179
01:21:56.744 --> 01:21:59.705
Come here. I have to tell you something.

1180
01:21:59.789 --> 01:22:01.290
I have to tell you something.

1181
01:22:02.625 --> 01:22:04.543
Well—

1182
01:22:19.058 --> 01:22:23.558
- It's not fair.
- What's not fair? What?

1183
01:22:23.813 --> 01:22:26.899
I've been here for four years...

1184
01:22:26.983 --> 01:22:28.901
and I've only just found you.

1185
01:22:30.486 --> 01:22:32.821
Well, you found me.

1186
01:22:44.667 --> 01:22:48.504
- Are you awake?
- No.

1187
01:22:49.755 --> 01:22:51.965
Yes, you are.

1188
01:22:55.011 --> 01:22:57.847
Will, come to California with me.

1189
01:22:59.515 --> 01:23:01.433
What?

1190
01:23:03.436 --> 01:23:06.564
I want you to come to California with me.

1191
01:23:11.319 --> 01:23:15.819
- You sure about that?
- Oh, yeah.

1192
01:23:16.157 --> 01:23:19.243
Yeah, but how do you know?

1193
01:23:19.327 --> 01:23:23.456
I don't know. I just know.

1194
01:23:23.539 --> 01:23:26.291
Yeah, but how do you know?

1195
01:23:26.375 --> 01:23:30.545
I know because I feel it.

1196
01:23:30.630 --> 01:23:34.383
- Because that's a really serious thing you're saying.
- I know.

1197
01:23:34.467 --> 01:23:36.927
You could be in California next week...

1198
01:23:37.011 --> 01:23:40.180
and you might find out
something about me you don't like.

1199
01:23:40.264 --> 01:23:42.307
Maybe you wish you hadn't said that...

1200
01:23:42.391 --> 01:23:44.768
but you know it's such a serious thing
you can't take it back.

1201
01:23:44.852 --> 01:23:47.980
Now I'm stuck in California with someone
that doesn't really want to be with me...

1202
01:23:48.064 --> 01:23:52.564
- just wish they had a take-back.
- A what? What's a take-back?

1203
01:23:52.693 --> 01:23:57.193
I don't want a take-back. I just want you
to come to California with me.

1204
01:23:58.574 --> 01:24:02.369
I can't go to California with you, so—

1205
01:24:03.412 --> 01:24:05.330
Why not?

1206
01:24:05.414 --> 01:24:09.543
One, because I got a job here.

1207
01:24:09.627 --> 01:24:11.587
And, two, because I live here.

1208
01:24:12.964 --> 01:24:16.384
Look, if you don't love me,
you should just tell me.

1209
01:24:16.467 --> 01:24:19.470
I'm not sayin' I don't love you.

1210
01:24:19.554 --> 01:24:24.054
Then why? Why won't you come?
What are you so scared of?

1211
01:24:24.809 --> 01:24:27.686
What am <i>I</i> so scared of?

1212
01:24:27.770 --> 01:24:30.522
What aren't you scared of?

1213
01:24:30.606 --> 01:24:33.567
You live in this safe little world where
no one challenges you—

1214
01:24:33.651 --> 01:24:37.529
Don't tell me about my world.
Don't tell me about my world.

1215
01:24:37.613 --> 01:24:40.198
You just want to have your little fling
with the guy from the other side of town.

1216
01:24:40.283 --> 01:24:43.077
Then you're gonna go off to Stanford.
You're gonna marry some rich prick...

1217
01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:45.078
who your parents will approve of...

1218
01:24:45.162 --> 01:24:47.164
and just sit around with
the other trust fund babies...

1219
01:24:47.248 --> 01:24:49.208
and talk about how you
went slummin', too, once.

1220
01:24:49.292 --> 01:24:53.792
Why are you saying this?
What is your obsession with this money?

1221
01:24:54.589 --> 01:24:59.089
My father died when I was 13,
and I inherited this money.

1222
01:24:59.176 --> 01:25:03.676
You don't think every day I wake up, and I
wish I could give it back?

1223
01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:08.310
That I would give it back in a second,
if it meant I could have one more day with him.

1224
01:25:08.394 --> 01:25:11.772
But I can't, and that's
my life, and I deal with it.

1225
01:25:11.856 --> 01:25:15.067
So don't put your shit on me
when you're the one that's afraid.

1226
01:25:15.151 --> 01:25:17.736
I'm afraid? What am I afraid of?
What the fuck am I afraid of?

1227
01:25:17.820 --> 01:25:20.322
You're afraid of me.
You're afraid that I won't love you back.

1228
01:25:20.406 --> 01:25:22.574
You know what? I'm afraid too.

1229
01:25:22.658 --> 01:25:25.786
But fuck it, I want to give it a shot.
At least I'm honest with you.

1230
01:25:25.870 --> 01:25:29.707
- I'm not honest with you?
- No, what about your 12 brothers?

1231
01:25:29.790 --> 01:25:32.083
All right.

1232
01:25:32.168 --> 01:25:34.295
No, you're not going. You're not leaving.

1233
01:25:34.378 --> 01:25:35.545
What do you want to know?

1234
01:25:35.630 --> 01:25:38.507
That I don't have 12 brothers?
That I'm a fuckin' orphan?

1235
01:25:38.591 --> 01:25:40.634
- You don't want to hear that.
- I didn't know that.

1236
01:25:40.718 --> 01:25:43.929
You don't want to hear I got fuckin'
cigarettes put out on me when I was little.

1237
01:25:44.013 --> 01:25:46.390
- I didn't know that.
- That this isn't fuckin' surgery.

1238
01:25:46.474 --> 01:25:49.435
The motherfucker stabbed me.
You don't want to hear that shit, Skylar!

1239
01:25:49.518 --> 01:25:51.770
- I do want to hear that.
- Don't tell me you want to hear that shit!

1240
01:25:51.854 --> 01:25:55.023
- I want to help you.
- Help me? What the fuck?

1241
01:25:55.107 --> 01:25:57.859
What do I got, a fuckin' sign on my back
that says, “Save me”?

1242
01:25:57.943 --> 01:25:59.861
- No.
- Do I look like I need that?

1243
01:25:59.945 --> 01:26:01.947
- No, I just want to be with you—
- Don't bullshit me!

1244
01:26:02.031 --> 01:26:06.035
- I love you.
- Don't bullshit me! Don't you fuckin' bullshit me!

1245
01:26:06.118 --> 01:26:09.037
I love you.

1246
01:26:09.121 --> 01:26:13.621
I want to hear you say
that you don't love me.

1247
01:26:14.210 --> 01:26:16.337
Because if you say that...

1248
01:26:18.381 --> 01:26:21.801
then I won't call you...

1249
01:26:21.884 --> 01:26:24.177
and I won't be in your life.

1250
01:26:29.809 --> 01:26:32.561
I don't love you.

1251
01:27:14.270 --> 01:27:17.690
Most people never get to see
how brilliant they can be.

1252
01:27:17.773 --> 01:27:20.525
They don't find teachers
who believe in them.

1253
01:27:20.609 --> 01:27:22.527
They get convinced they're stupid.

1254
01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:27.241
I hope you appreciate what he's doing...

1255
01:27:27.324 --> 01:27:31.824
because I've seen how much he enjoys
working with you, not against you.

1256
01:27:36.917 --> 01:27:39.544
Hello, Will.

1257
01:27:39.628 --> 01:27:41.880
Tom, can you get us some coffee?

1258
01:27:41.964 --> 01:27:43.924
Sure.

1259
01:27:47.470 --> 01:27:51.390
Now, let's see.

1260
01:27:55.519 --> 01:27:58.772
Good. This is correct.

1261
01:28:00.232 --> 01:28:02.609
I see you used Maclaurin here.

1262
01:28:02.693 --> 01:28:05.737
Yeah, I don't know what you call it, but—

1263
01:28:05.821 --> 01:28:08.156
This can't be right.

1264
01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:14.121
This would be very embarrassing.

1265
01:28:17.082 --> 01:28:20.126
- Did you ever consider—
- I'm pretty sure it's right.

1266
01:28:20.211 --> 01:28:22.379
Hey, look, can we
do this at Sean's office from now on?

1267
01:28:22.463 --> 01:28:26.550
Because I got to knock off work to come
here and the commute is killin' me.

1268
01:28:26.634 --> 01:28:30.262
- Yeah. Did you think of the possibility—
- It's right.

1269
01:28:30.346 --> 01:28:34.846
It's right. Just take it home with you.

1270
01:28:38.729 --> 01:28:40.689
What happened at the McNeil meeting?

1271
01:28:40.773 --> 01:28:42.733
I couldn't go. I had a date.

1272
01:28:42.817 --> 01:28:45.986
So I sent my chief negotiator.

1273
01:28:49.782 --> 01:28:53.494
On your own time,
you can do whatever you like, Will.

1274
01:28:53.577 --> 01:28:56.204
But when I set up a meeting
with my associates...

1275
01:28:56.288 --> 01:28:58.957
and you don't show up,
it reflects poorly on me.

1276
01:28:59.041 --> 01:29:01.209
- Then don't set up any more meetings.
- I won't.

1277
01:29:01.293 --> 01:29:03.712
I'll cancel 'em.

1278
01:29:03.796 --> 01:29:06.298
I'll give you a job myself. I just wanted
you to see what was out there.

1279
01:29:06.382 --> 01:29:10.594
Maybe I don't want to spend the rest of my
fuckin' life explainin' shit to people.

1280
01:29:17.726 --> 01:29:20.103
I think you could show me
some appreciation.

1281
01:29:21.438 --> 01:29:24.649
A little appreciation?
Do you know how easy this is for me?

1282
01:29:24.733 --> 01:29:28.027
Do you have any fuckin' idea
how easy this is? This is a fuckin' joke.

1283
01:29:28.112 --> 01:29:30.197
I'm sorry you can't do this— I really am—

1284
01:29:30.281 --> 01:29:33.867
Because I wouldn't have to fuckin' sit here
and watch you fumble around and fuck it up.

1285
01:29:39.206 --> 01:29:42.834
Then you'd have more time to sit around
and get drunk instead, wouldn't you?

1286
01:29:42.918 --> 01:29:47.418
You're right. This is probably
a total waste of my time.

1287
01:30:01.604 --> 01:30:03.814
You're right, Will.

1288
01:30:05.983 --> 01:30:10.483
I can't do this proof, but you can.

1289
01:30:10.654 --> 01:30:14.699
And when it comes to that, it's only about
just a handful of people in the world...

1290
01:30:14.783 --> 01:30:16.868
who can tell the difference
between you and me.

1291
01:30:16.952 --> 01:30:19.204
- But I'm one of them.
- Sorry.

1292
01:30:19.288 --> 01:30:21.373
Yeah, so am I.

1293
01:30:21.457 --> 01:30:24.460
Most days I wish I never met you...

1294
01:30:27.755 --> 01:30:29.298
because then I could sleep at night.

1295
01:30:29.381 --> 01:30:33.881
I didn't have to walk around with the knowledge
that there was someone like you out there.

1296
01:30:41.644 --> 01:30:46.106
And I didn't have to watch you
throw it all away.

1297
01:30:52.237 --> 01:30:56.737
Bill, hold it. Did you hear that?

1298
01:31:00.329 --> 01:31:02.414
If you're watchin' pornos
in my mom's room again...

1299
01:31:02.498 --> 01:31:05.167
I'm gonna give you a fuckin' beat in'!

1300
01:31:21.058 --> 01:31:24.102
What's up, fellas?

1301
01:31:24.186 --> 01:31:28.686
Morgan, why don't you jerk off in your own
fuckin' house. That's fuckin' filthy.

1302
01:31:28.857 --> 01:31:32.986
I don't have a V.C.R. in my house.

1303
01:31:33.070 --> 01:31:35.739
Come on. Not in my glove.

1304
01:31:35.823 --> 01:31:38.200
I didn't use the glove.

1305
01:31:38.283 --> 01:31:41.828
That's my Little League glove.

1306
01:31:41.912 --> 01:31:45.332
What do you want me to do?

1307
01:31:45.416 --> 01:31:47.543
I mean, what's wrong with you?

1308
01:31:47.626 --> 01:31:49.794
You'll hump a baseball glove?

1309
01:31:49.878 --> 01:31:53.006
I-I just used it for cleanup.

1310
01:31:53.090 --> 01:31:56.802
Stop jerkin' off in my mother's room.

1311
01:31:56.885 --> 01:32:00.054
- Is there another V.C.R. in the house?
- It's just sad, bro.

1312
01:32:01.765 --> 01:32:06.265
So why do you think I should work for the
National Security Agency?

1313
01:32:06.729 --> 01:32:09.815
You'd be working on the cutting edge.

1314
01:32:09.898 --> 01:32:13.276
You'd be exposed to the kind of technology
you wouldn't see anywhere else...

1315
01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:15.945
because we've classified it.

1316
01:32:16.030 --> 01:32:19.658
Superstring theory,
chaos math, advanced algorithms.

1317
01:32:19.742 --> 01:32:22.661
Code breaking.

1318
01:32:22.745 --> 01:32:25.539
That's one aspect of what we do.

1319
01:32:25.622 --> 01:32:28.249
Oh, come on. That is what you do.

1320
01:32:28.333 --> 01:32:30.752
You guys handle 80% of
the intelligence workload.

1321
01:32:30.836 --> 01:32:33.338
You're seven times the size of the C.I.A.

1322
01:32:33.422 --> 01:32:37.922
We don't like to brag about that, Will,
but you're exactly right.

1323
01:32:39.303 --> 01:32:43.181
So the way I see it, the question isn't:

1324
01:32:43.265 --> 01:32:45.892
“Why should you work for the N.S.A.?”

1325
01:32:45.976 --> 01:32:48.436
The question is: “Why shouldn't you?”

1326
01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:52.398
Why shouldn't I work for the N.S.A.?

1327
01:32:52.483 --> 01:32:56.403
That's a tough one, but I'll take a shot.

1328
01:32:56.487 --> 01:32:59.198
Say I'm workin' at the N.S.A.
and somebody puts a code on my desk.

1329
01:32:59.281 --> 01:33:01.199
Something no one else can break.

1330
01:33:01.283 --> 01:33:03.201
Maybe I take a shot at it,
and maybe I break it.

1331
01:33:03.285 --> 01:33:05.829
I'm real happy with myself
because I did my job well.

1332
01:33:05.913 --> 01:33:09.458
But maybe that code was the location of some
rebel army in North Africa or the Middle East.

1333
01:33:09.541 --> 01:33:12.585
Once they have that location, they bomb
the village where the rebels are hidin'.

1334
01:33:12.669 --> 01:33:16.881
Fifteen hundred people that I never met,
never had no problem with, get killed.

1335
01:33:16.965 --> 01:33:19.926
Now the politicians are saying,
“Send in the Marines to secure the area”...

1336
01:33:20.010 --> 01:33:21.928
'cause they don't give a shit.

1337
01:33:22.012 --> 01:33:23.930
It won't be their kid
over there gettin' shot...

1338
01:33:24.014 --> 01:33:26.975
just like it wasn't them when their number
got called cause they were in the National Guard.

1339
01:33:27.059 --> 01:33:29.895
It'll be some kid from Southie
over there takin' shrapnel in the ass.

1340
01:33:29.978 --> 01:33:31.980
He comes back to find the plant
he used to work at...

1341
01:33:32.064 --> 01:33:34.524
got exported to the country
he got back from...

1342
01:33:34.608 --> 01:33:36.901
and the guy who put
the shrapnel in his ass got his old job...

1343
01:33:36.985 --> 01:33:39.862
'cause he'll work for 15 cents a day
and no bathroom breaks.

1344
01:33:39.947 --> 01:33:42.532
Meanwhile, he realizes the only reason he
was over there in the first place...

1345
01:33:42.616 --> 01:33:45.744
was so we could install a government that
would sell us oil at a good price.

1346
01:33:45.828 --> 01:33:49.832
Of course, the oil companies used a skirmish
over there to scare up domestic oil prices.

1347
01:33:49.915 --> 01:33:54.002
A cute little ancillary benefit for them,
but it ain't helpin' my buddy at 2.50 a gallon.

1348
01:33:54.086 --> 01:33:56.421
They're takin' their sweet time
bringin' the oil, of course.

1349
01:33:56.505 --> 01:33:58.590
Maybe they even took the liberty to hire
an alcoholic skipper...

1350
01:33:58.674 --> 01:34:01.885
who likes to drink martinis
and fuckin' play slalom with the icebergs.

1351
01:34:01.969 --> 01:34:04.221
It ain't too long till
he hits one, spills the oil...

1352
01:34:04.304 --> 01:34:06.764
and kills all the sea life
in the North Atlantic.

1353
01:34:06.849 --> 01:34:09.101
So now my buddy's out of work,
he can't afford to drive...

1354
01:34:09.184 --> 01:34:11.102
so he's walkin' to
the fuckin' job interviews...

1355
01:34:11.186 --> 01:34:13.938
which sucks because the shrapnel in his
ass is givin' him chronic hemorrhoids.

1356
01:34:14.022 --> 01:34:16.566
Meanwhile, he's starvin', 'cause every
time he tries to get a bite to eat...

1357
01:34:16.650 --> 01:34:18.568
the only blue plate special
they're servin'...

1358
01:34:18.652 --> 01:34:21.571
is North Atlantic scrod with Quaker State.

1359
01:34:21.655 --> 01:34:26.155
So what did I think?
I'm holdin' out for somethin' better.

1360
01:34:26.743 --> 01:34:30.580
I figure, fuck it. While I'm at it,
why not just shoot my buddy...

1361
01:34:30.664 --> 01:34:32.582
take his job, give it to his sworn enemy...

1362
01:34:32.666 --> 01:34:35.168
hike up gas prices,
bomb a village, club a baby seal...

1363
01:34:35.252 --> 01:34:37.921
hit the hash pipe
and join the National Guard?

1364
01:34:38.005 --> 01:34:40.549
I can be elected president.

1365
01:34:40.632 --> 01:34:43.885
- You feel like you're alone?
- What?

1366
01:34:43.969 --> 01:34:47.597
Do you have a soul mate?

1367
01:34:47.681 --> 01:34:50.183
Do I have a— Define that.

1368
01:34:50.267 --> 01:34:52.227
Somebody who challenges you.

1369
01:34:53.478 --> 01:34:54.479
Chuckie.

1370
01:34:54.563 --> 01:34:58.149
No, Chuckie's family.
He'd lie down in fuckin' traffic for you.

1371
01:34:58.233 --> 01:35:02.733
I'm talking about someone who opens up
things for you, touches your soul.

1372
01:35:03.947 --> 01:35:07.116
- I got—
- Who?

1373
01:35:07.201 --> 01:35:10.245
- I got plenty.
- Name em.

1374
01:35:10.329 --> 01:35:13.332
Shakespeare, Nietzsche, Frost,
O'Connor, Kant, Pope, Locke—

1375
01:35:13.415 --> 01:35:15.625
That's great. They're all dead.

1376
01:35:15.709 --> 01:35:18.795
- Not to me they're not.
- You don't have a lot of dialogue with them.

1377
01:35:18.879 --> 01:35:22.299
You can't give back to them, Will.

1378
01:35:22.382 --> 01:35:24.717
Not without some serious
smelling salts and a heater.

1379
01:35:24.801 --> 01:35:26.719
That's what I'm saying.

1380
01:35:26.803 --> 01:35:30.348
You'll never have that kind
of relationship in a world...

1381
01:35:30.432 --> 01:35:32.851
where you're always afraid
to take the first step...

1382
01:35:32.935 --> 01:35:36.730
because all you see is every negative
thing 10 miles down the road.

1383
01:35:36.813 --> 01:35:38.815
- You gonna take the professor's side on this?
- Don't give me a line of shit.

1384
01:35:38.899 --> 01:35:40.859
- No.
- I didn't want the job.

1385
01:35:40.943 --> 01:35:42.861
It's not about the job. I don't care if
you work for the government.

1386
01:35:42.945 --> 01:35:46.073
But you can do anything you want.
You are bound by nothing.

1387
01:35:46.156 --> 01:35:50.656
What are you passionate about?
What do you want?

1388
01:35:51.286 --> 01:35:53.621
There are guys who work their entire life
layin' brick...

1389
01:35:53.705 --> 01:35:55.957
so their kids have a chance
at the opportunities you have here.

1390
01:35:56.041 --> 01:35:58.501
- I didn't ask for this.
- No.

1391
01:35:58.585 --> 01:36:01.045
You were born with it, so don't cop out
behind: “I didn't ask for this.”

1392
01:36:01.129 --> 01:36:04.298
What do you mean, cop out?
What's wrong with layin' brick?

1393
01:36:04.383 --> 01:36:05.384
Nothing.

1394
01:36:05.467 --> 01:36:07.302
There's nothin' wrong,
That's somebody's home I'm buildin'.

1395
01:36:07.386 --> 01:36:10.222
Right. My dad laid brick, okay?

1396
01:36:10.305 --> 01:36:12.223
Busted his ass so
I could have an education.

1397
01:36:12.307 --> 01:36:14.517
Exactly. That's an honorable profession.

1398
01:36:14.601 --> 01:36:15.935
What's wrong with fixin' somebody's car?

1399
01:36:16.019 --> 01:36:18.479
Someone will get to work the next day
because of me. That's honor in that.

1400
01:36:18.563 --> 01:36:20.523
Yeah, there is, Will.
There is honor in that.

1401
01:36:20.607 --> 01:36:22.900
There's honor in takin'
that 40-minute train ride...

1402
01:36:22.985 --> 01:36:25.487
so those college kids could come in in the
morning and their floors are clean.

1403
01:36:25.570 --> 01:36:27.321
And their wastebaskets are empty.
That's real work.

1404
01:36:27.406 --> 01:36:28.573
That's right.

1405
01:36:28.657 --> 01:36:31.660
And that's honorable.
I'm sure that's why you took that job.

1406
01:36:31.743 --> 01:36:33.745
For the <i>honor</i> of it.

1407
01:36:33.829 --> 01:36:38.329
I just have a little question here.
You could be a janitor anywhere.

1408
01:36:38.542 --> 01:36:42.212
Why did you work at the most prestigious
technical college in the whole fuckin' world?

1409
01:36:42.296 --> 01:36:45.590
Why did you sneak around at night and
finish other people's formulas...

1410
01:36:45.674 --> 01:36:50.174
that only one or two people in the world
could do and then lie about it?

1411
01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:54.641
Cause I don't see
a lot of honor in that, Will.

1412
01:36:57.853 --> 01:37:00.522
So what do you really wanna do?

1413
01:37:03.859 --> 01:37:05.777
I wanna be a shepherd.

1414
01:37:05.861 --> 01:37:07.779
Really?

1415
01:37:07.863 --> 01:37:11.825
I wanna move up to Nashua, get a nice
little spread, get some sheep and tend to them.

1416
01:37:11.908 --> 01:37:14.827
- Maybe you should go do that.
- What?

1417
01:37:14.911 --> 01:37:17.872
If you're gonna jerk off, why don't you
just do it at home with a moist towel?

1418
01:37:17.956 --> 01:37:19.916
- You're chuckin' me?
- Yeah, get the fuck outta here.

1419
01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.960
- No, no, no, time's not up yet.
- Yeah, it is.

1420
01:37:22.044 --> 01:37:24.671
- I'm not leavin'. No.
- You're not gonna answer, you're wastin' my time.

1421
01:37:24.755 --> 01:37:26.715
I thought we were friends.

1422
01:37:26.798 --> 01:37:30.426
- Playtime's over, okay?
- Why are you kickin' me out?

1423
01:37:30.510 --> 01:37:33.804
You're lecturin' me on life?
Look at you, you fuckin' burnout.

1424
01:37:33.889 --> 01:37:36.099
- What winds your clock?
- Workin' with you.

1425
01:37:36.183 --> 01:37:39.269
Where's your soul mate? You wanna talk
about soul mates? Where is she?

1426
01:37:39.353 --> 01:37:41.480
- Dead.
- That's right. She's fuckin' dead.

1427
01:37:41.563 --> 01:37:44.274
She fuckin' dies and you just cash in your
chips and you walk away?

1428
01:37:44.358 --> 01:37:45.984
At least I played a hand.

1429
01:37:46.068 --> 01:37:48.570
You played a hand and you lost.
You lost a big fuckin' hand.

1430
01:37:48.653 --> 01:37:52.031
Some people will lose a big hand like that
and have the sack to ante up again.

1431
01:37:52.115 --> 01:37:55.243
Look at me. What do you wanna do?

1432
01:38:02.167 --> 01:38:06.379
You and your bullshit.
You got a bullshit answer for everybody.

1433
01:38:06.463 --> 01:38:10.175
But I ask you a very simple question, and
you can't give me a straight answer...

1434
01:38:10.258 --> 01:38:14.262
because you don't know.

1435
01:38:15.931 --> 01:38:18.099
I'll see ya, Bo-peep.

1436
01:38:21.103 --> 01:38:23.230
- Fuck you.
- You're the shepherd.

1437
01:38:27.943 --> 01:38:30.195
Shepherd.

1438
01:38:30.278 --> 01:38:32.363
White little prick.

1439
01:38:33.573 --> 01:38:38.073
I just wanted to call you up
before you left.

1440
01:38:39.204 --> 01:38:41.831
I've been takin' all these
job interviews and stuff...

1441
01:38:41.915 --> 01:38:43.833
so I'm not gonna be just
a construction worker.

1442
01:38:43.917 --> 01:38:46.628
Well, I never really cared about that.

1443
01:38:48.130 --> 01:38:50.090
Yeah.

1444
01:38:52.592 --> 01:38:54.594
I love you.

1445
01:38:58.932 --> 01:39:01.392
Will?

1446
01:39:01.476 --> 01:39:04.312
You take care.

1447
01:40:15.217 --> 01:40:17.886
Will, come on. Will!

1448
01:40:19.971 --> 01:40:22.056
Will, that's it! We're done!

1449
01:40:22.140 --> 01:40:26.640
I'm sitting in your office,
and the boy isn't here.

1450
01:40:26.937 --> 01:40:28.980
It's 10 past 5:00.

1451
01:40:29.064 --> 01:40:31.066
An <i>hour</i> and 10 minutes late.

1452
01:40:34.569 --> 01:40:38.030
If he doesn't show up, and
I file a report saying he wasn't here...

1453
01:40:38.114 --> 01:40:42.034
and he goes back to jail,
it won't be on my conscience.

1454
01:40:45.038 --> 01:40:48.041
Okay. Fine.

1455
01:40:49.543 --> 01:40:51.461
What's up?

1456
01:40:53.421 --> 01:40:55.381
Thanks.

1457
01:40:58.009 --> 01:41:01.929
Fuck, that's good.

1458
01:41:05.725 --> 01:41:08.185
So how's your lady?

1459
01:41:08.270 --> 01:41:10.230
She's gone.

1460
01:41:11.189 --> 01:41:13.524
Gone? Gone where?

1461
01:41:13.608 --> 01:41:17.236
Med school. Medical school in California.

1462
01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:19.238
- Really?
- Yeah.

1463
01:41:19.322 --> 01:41:22.283
- When was this?
- It was, like, a week ago.

1464
01:41:26.663 --> 01:41:28.623
That sucks.

1465
01:41:31.626 --> 01:41:35.129
So, when are you done
with those meetings?

1466
01:41:35.213 --> 01:41:37.215
I think the week after I'm 21.

1467
01:41:37.299 --> 01:41:40.051
They gonna hook ya up with a job or what?

1468
01:41:40.135 --> 01:41:44.347
Yeah, fuckin' sit in a room and do long
division for the next 50 years.

1469
01:41:44.431 --> 01:41:47.809
Nah, probably make some nice bank though.

1470
01:41:47.892 --> 01:41:49.852
I'm gonna be a fuckin' lab rat.

1471
01:41:49.936 --> 01:41:53.272
Better than this shit. Way outta here.

1472
01:41:53.356 --> 01:41:55.566
What do I want a way outta here for?

1473
01:41:55.650 --> 01:41:57.902
I mean, I'm gonna fuckin'
live here the rest of my life.

1474
01:41:57.986 --> 01:42:00.071
You know, be neighbors.
You know, have little kids.

1475
01:42:00.155 --> 01:42:02.907
Fuckin' take 'em
to Little League together up Foley Field.

1476
01:42:06.328 --> 01:42:09.748
Look, you're my best friend,
so don't take this the wrong way.

1477
01:42:09.831 --> 01:42:12.708
But in 20 years if
you're still livin' here...

1478
01:42:12.792 --> 01:42:14.710
comin' over to my house
to watch the Patriots games...

1479
01:42:14.794 --> 01:42:18.422
still workin' construction,
I'll fuckin' kill ya.

1480
01:42:18.506 --> 01:42:21.050
That's not a threat.
That's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill ya.

1481
01:42:21.134 --> 01:42:23.261
What the fuck are you talkin' about?

1482
01:42:23.345 --> 01:42:26.556
- Look, you got something none of us have.
- Oh, come on!

1483
01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:29.643
Why is it always this? I fuckin'
owe it to myself to do this or that.

1484
01:42:29.726 --> 01:42:34.226
- What if I don't want to?
- No, no. Fuck you. You don't owe it to yourself.

1485
01:42:34.856 --> 01:42:37.108
You owe it to me...

1486
01:42:37.192 --> 01:42:39.736
'cause tomorrow I'm gonna
wake up and I'll be 50...

1487
01:42:39.819 --> 01:42:42.238
and I'll still be doin' this shit.

1488
01:42:42.322 --> 01:42:44.907
That's all right. That's fine.

1489
01:42:44.991 --> 01:42:47.576
I mean, you're sittin' on
a winnin' lottery ticket.

1490
01:42:47.661 --> 01:42:51.247
You're too much of a pussy to cash it in,
and that's bullshit.

1491
01:42:53.333 --> 01:42:56.210
'Cause I'd do fuckin' anything
to have what you got.

1492
01:42:56.294 --> 01:42:59.130
So would any of these fuckin' guys.

1493
01:42:59.214 --> 01:43:01.883
It'd be an insult to us
if you're still here in 20 years.

1494
01:43:01.966 --> 01:43:04.510
Hangin' around here
is a fuckin' waste of your time.

1495
01:43:04.594 --> 01:43:06.721
- You don't know that.
- I don't?

1496
01:43:06.805 --> 01:43:07.889
No. You don't know that.

1497
01:43:07.972 --> 01:43:10.265
I don't know that.
Let me tell you what I do know.

1498
01:43:10.350 --> 01:43:14.145
Every day I come by your house,
and I pick you up.

1499
01:43:14.229 --> 01:43:18.233
We go out and have a few drinks and few
laughs, and it's great.

1500
01:43:18.316 --> 01:43:20.985
You know what the best part of my day is?

1501
01:43:21.069 --> 01:43:25.490
It's for about 10 seconds: from when I pull up
to the curb and when I get to your door.

1502
01:43:25.573 --> 01:43:30.073
'Cause I think maybe I'll get up there
and I'll knock on the door, and you won't be there.

1503
01:43:30.328 --> 01:43:33.873
No “good-bye,” no “see ya later.”
No nothing. You just left.

1504
01:43:35.458 --> 01:43:38.169
I don't know much, but I know that.

1505
01:43:49.889 --> 01:43:52.141
This is a disaster, Sean.

1506
01:43:52.225 --> 01:43:55.603
I brought you in here because I wanted you
to help me with the boy...

1507
01:43:55.687 --> 01:43:57.814
- not to run him out.
- I know what I'm doing with the boy.

1508
01:43:57.897 --> 01:43:59.857
I don't care if you have
a rapport with the boy!

1509
01:43:59.941 --> 01:44:01.400
I don't care if you have a few laughs.

1510
01:44:01.484 --> 01:44:04.028
But don't you dare undermine
what I'm trying to do here.

1511
01:44:04.112 --> 01:44:05.363
Undermine?

1512
01:44:05.447 --> 01:44:07.532
This boy is at a fragile point right now.

1513
01:44:07.615 --> 01:44:10.451
I do understand. He is at a fragile point.
He's got problems.

1514
01:44:10.535 --> 01:44:14.080
What problems does he have? That he's
better off as a janitor, in jail?

1515
01:44:14.164 --> 01:44:17.417
Better hanging out with
a bunch of retarded gorillas?

1516
01:44:17.500 --> 01:44:21.420
Why do you think he does that?
You have any fuckin' clue why?

1517
01:44:21.504 --> 01:44:25.049
He can handle the problems. He can handle
the work. He obviously handled you.

1518
01:44:25.133 --> 01:44:27.552
Listen to me. Why is he hiding?

1519
01:44:27.635 --> 01:44:30.471
Why doesn't he trust anybody?
Because the first thing that happened to him...

1520
01:44:30.555 --> 01:44:33.683
he was abandoned by the people who were
supposed to love him the most.

1521
01:44:33.767 --> 01:44:35.769
Don't give me that Freudian crap.

1522
01:44:35.852 --> 01:44:38.104
Why does he hang out with
those retarded gorillas, as you call them?

1523
01:44:38.188 --> 01:44:41.774
Because any one of them, if he asked them
to, would take a bat to your head.

1524
01:44:41.858 --> 01:44:44.735
- That's called loyalty.
- Yeah, that's very touching.

1525
01:44:44.819 --> 01:44:47.988
Who's he handling? He pushes people away
before they have a chance to leave him.

1526
01:44:48.072 --> 01:44:50.574
It's a defense mechanism, all right?

1527
01:44:50.658 --> 01:44:53.494
For 20 years, he's been
alone because of that.

1528
01:44:53.578 --> 01:44:56.247
If you push him right now, it's gonna be
the same thing all over again.

1529
01:44:56.331 --> 01:44:58.124
I'm not gonna let that happen to him.

1530
01:44:58.208 --> 01:45:00.251
- Don't you do that.
- What?

1531
01:45:00.335 --> 01:45:04.005
Don't infect him with the idea that it's okay
to quit, that it's okay to be a failure.

1532
01:45:04.088 --> 01:45:06.090
Because it's not okay, Sean!

1533
01:45:06.174 --> 01:45:09.969
If you're angry at me for being successful,
for being what you could have been—

1534
01:45:10.053 --> 01:45:12.889
- I'm not angry at you.
- Oh, yes, you're angry at me.

1535
01:45:12.972 --> 01:45:16.976
You resent me, but I'm not gonna apologize
for any success I've had.

1536
01:45:17.060 --> 01:45:19.937
You're angry at me for doing
what you could have done!

1537
01:45:20.021 --> 01:45:22.023
But ask yourself, Sean— Ask yourself...

1538
01:45:22.106 --> 01:45:25.484
if you want Will to feel that way—
if you want him to feel like a failure?

1539
01:45:25.568 --> 01:45:27.695
You arrogant shit!

1540
01:45:27.779 --> 01:45:32.158
That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions,
'cause I can't stand that look in your eye.

1541
01:45:32.242 --> 01:45:35.370
- That condescending, embarrassed look.
- Oh, come on, Sean.

1542
01:45:35.453 --> 01:45:37.329
You think I'm a failure. I know who I am.

1543
01:45:37.413 --> 01:45:41.913
I'm proud of what I do. It was a conscious
choice. I didn't fuck up!

1544
01:45:42.085 --> 01:45:44.796
And you and your cronies think
I'm some sort of pity case.

1545
01:45:44.879 --> 01:45:48.424
You and your kiss-ass chorus following you
around going, “The Field's medal!”

1546
01:45:48.508 --> 01:45:51.928
Why are you still so
fuckin' afraid of failure?

1547
01:45:52.011 --> 01:45:55.973
It's about my medal, isn't it? Oh, God,
I could go get it for you. You can have it.

1548
01:45:56.057 --> 01:45:59.143
Shove the medal up
your fuckin' ass, all right?

1549
01:45:59.227 --> 01:46:01.145
'Cause I don't give
a shit about your medal...

1550
01:46:01.229 --> 01:46:03.147
because I knew you before
you were a mathematical god...

1551
01:46:03.231 --> 01:46:06.859
when you were pimple-faced and homesick
and didn't know what side of the bed to piss on.

1552
01:46:06.943 --> 01:46:09.028
Yeah, you were smarter than me then, and
you're smarter than me now.

1553
01:46:09.112 --> 01:46:10.947
So don't blame me for
how your life turned out.

1554
01:46:11.030 --> 01:46:13.407
I don't blame you! It's not about you!

1555
01:46:13.491 --> 01:46:16.243
You mathematical dick! It's about the boy!

1556
01:46:16.327 --> 01:46:17.828
He's a good kid!

1557
01:46:17.912 --> 01:46:21.415
And I won't see you fuck him up like
you're tryin' to fuck up me right now.

1558
01:46:21.499 --> 01:46:23.918
I won't see you make him
feel like a failure too!

1559
01:46:24.002 --> 01:46:27.547
- He won't be a failure!
- But if you push him! If you ride him!

1560
01:46:27.630 --> 01:46:32.130
I am what I am today because I was pushed
and because I learned to push myself.

1561
01:46:33.261 --> 01:46:35.429
He's not you! You get that?

1562
01:46:37.557 --> 01:46:39.308
I can come back.

1563
01:46:39.392 --> 01:46:43.437
No, come in. I was just leaving.

1564
01:46:53.781 --> 01:46:57.701
A lot of that stuff goes back
a long way between me and him.

1565
01:46:57.785 --> 01:46:59.745
You know. Not about you.

1566
01:47:05.335 --> 01:47:07.086
What is that?

1567
01:47:07.170 --> 01:47:10.965
This is your file. I have to send it
back to the judge for evaluation.

1568
01:47:11.049 --> 01:47:15.549
Hey, you're not
gonna fail me, are you?

1569
01:47:19.849 --> 01:47:22.059
What's it say?

1570
01:47:23.436 --> 01:47:26.147
- Wanna read it?
- Why?

1571
01:47:27.815 --> 01:47:30.901
Have you had any experience with that?

1572
01:47:30.985 --> 01:47:34.571
Twenty years of counseling.
Yeah, I've seen some pretty awful shit.

1573
01:47:34.656 --> 01:47:38.993
I mean, have you had
any experience with that?

1574
01:47:43.122 --> 01:47:46.625
- Personally?
- Yeah.

1575
01:47:46.709 --> 01:47:48.544
Yeah, I have.

1576
01:47:48.628 --> 01:47:50.671
It sure ain't good.

1577
01:47:54.175 --> 01:47:56.177
My father was an alcoholic.

1578
01:47:56.260 --> 01:47:59.137
Mean fuckin' drunk.

1579
01:48:00.807 --> 01:48:03.768
He'd come home hammered,
lookin' to whale on somebody.

1580
01:48:03.851 --> 01:48:08.313
So I'd provoke him so he wouldn't go after
my mother and little brother.

1581
01:48:09.482 --> 01:48:12.610
Interesting nights were
when he wore his rings.

1582
01:48:13.611 --> 01:48:17.072
He used to just put a wrench...

1583
01:48:17.156 --> 01:48:19.908
a stick and a belt on the table.

1584
01:48:19.993 --> 01:48:24.122
- Just say, “Choose.”
- I gotta go with the belt there.

1585
01:48:24.205 --> 01:48:26.040
I used to go with the wrench.

1586
01:48:26.124 --> 01:48:28.209
Why the wrench?

1587
01:48:28.292 --> 01:48:30.544
'Cause fuck him, that's why.

1588
01:48:30.628 --> 01:48:34.298
- Your foster father?
- Yeah.

1589
01:48:34.382 --> 01:48:38.302
So, what is it?
Like, Will has an attachment disorder?

1590
01:48:38.386 --> 01:48:40.596
Is it all that stuff?

1591
01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:42.682
Fear of abandonment?

1592
01:48:43.725 --> 01:48:46.644
Is that why I broke up with Skylar?

1593
01:48:46.728 --> 01:48:49.564
- I didn't know you had.
- Yeah, I did.

1594
01:48:50.231 --> 01:48:52.358
- You wanna talk about it?
- No.

1595
01:48:56.404 --> 01:49:00.904
Hey, Will, I don't know a lot.

1596
01:49:02.326 --> 01:49:05.746
You see this? All this shit?

1597
01:49:10.752 --> 01:49:12.837
It's not your fault.

1598
01:49:15.131 --> 01:49:17.299
Yeah, I know that.

1599
01:49:17.383 --> 01:49:20.344
Look at me, son.

1600
01:49:20.428 --> 01:49:23.931
- It's not your fault.
- I know.

1601
01:49:24.015 --> 01:49:27.435
No. It's not your fault.

1602
01:49:28.728 --> 01:49:30.646
I know.

1603
01:49:30.730 --> 01:49:33.733
No, no, you don't. It's not your fault.

1604
01:49:35.318 --> 01:49:37.278
I know.

1605
01:49:37.361 --> 01:49:40.072
- It's not your fault.
- All right.

1606
01:49:40.156 --> 01:49:42.491
It's not your fault.

1607
01:49:44.494 --> 01:49:48.994
- It's not your fault.
- Don't fuck with me.

1608
01:49:49.749 --> 01:49:52.209
It's not your fault.

1609
01:49:52.293 --> 01:49:55.838
Don't fuck with me, all right?
Don't fuck with me, Sean, not you.

1610
01:49:55.922 --> 01:49:58.466
It's not your fault.

1611
01:50:06.182 --> 01:50:07.683
It's not your fault.

1612
01:50:13.981 --> 01:50:17.067
My God—

1613
01:50:17.151 --> 01:50:21.651
My God! I'm so sorry! My God!

1614
01:50:36.003 --> 01:50:38.130
Fuck them, okay?

1615
01:52:04.258 --> 01:52:05.217
Can I help you?

1616
01:52:05.301 --> 01:52:08.345
Yeah, I'm Will Hunting.
I'm here about a position.

1617
01:52:08.429 --> 01:52:10.806
Could you just have a seat for a moment?

1618
01:52:14.435 --> 01:52:17.771
Yes, there's a Mr. Hunting in the lobby.

1619
01:52:37.625 --> 01:52:39.877
Which one did you take?

1620
01:52:39.961 --> 01:52:44.461
I was over at McNeil. It's one of the jobs
the professor set me up with.

1621
01:52:44.966 --> 01:52:49.345
I haven't told him yet, but I went down
there and talked to my boss—

1622
01:52:49.428 --> 01:52:52.848
My new boss. He seemed like a good guy.

1623
01:52:52.932 --> 01:52:57.432
- Is that what you want?
- Yeah, you know, I think so.

1624
01:52:58.396 --> 01:53:01.399
Good for you. Congratulations.

1625
01:53:01.482 --> 01:53:03.442
Thanks.

1626
01:53:06.487 --> 01:53:08.447
Time's up.

1627
01:53:11.367 --> 01:53:14.620
So that's— So that's it? So we're done?

1628
01:53:14.704 --> 01:53:17.498
Yeah, that's it.

1629
01:53:17.581 --> 01:53:20.458
You're done. You're a free man.

1630
01:53:21.711 --> 01:53:26.211
Well, I just want you to know, Sean, that—

1631
01:53:26.507 --> 01:53:28.509
You're welcome, Will.

1632
01:53:33.681 --> 01:53:36.600
So, you know, I hope
we keep in touch, you know.

1633
01:53:36.684 --> 01:53:39.269
Yeah, me too.

1634
01:53:39.353 --> 01:53:41.855
I'll be travelin' around a bit.
It'll be a little hard, but...

1635
01:53:41.939 --> 01:53:45.609
I've got an answering machine
at the college I'll be checking in with.

1636
01:53:45.693 --> 01:53:49.613
So, here's the number.

1637
01:53:49.697 --> 01:53:53.575
You call that. I'll get back
to you right away.

1638
01:53:53.659 --> 01:53:56.745
Yeah, you know,
I figured I'm just gonna...

1639
01:53:56.829 --> 01:53:59.873
put my money back on the table and see
what kind of cards I get.

1640
01:54:02.668 --> 01:54:05.671
You do what's in your heart, son.
You'll be fine.

1641
01:54:10.134 --> 01:54:12.219
Thank you, Sean.

1642
01:54:12.303 --> 01:54:14.471
Thank you, Will.

1643
01:54:16.182 --> 01:54:19.476
Hey, does this violate
the patient-doctor relationship?

1644
01:54:19.560 --> 01:54:21.603
Naw. Only if you grab my ass.

1645
01:54:25.483 --> 01:54:27.568
- Take care.
- You too.

1646
01:54:27.651 --> 01:54:29.694
Yeah.

1647
01:54:31.489 --> 01:54:33.407
Hey.

1648
01:54:33.491 --> 01:54:35.868
Good luck, son.

1649
01:54:47.088 --> 01:54:49.882
Two beers.

1650
01:54:52.593 --> 01:54:54.595
What's up? Did you guys go?

1651
01:54:54.678 --> 01:54:57.013
No. I had to talk him down.

1652
01:54:57.098 --> 01:55:00.810
- Why didn't you yoke him?
- Little Morgan's got a lot of scrap to him.

1653
01:55:00.893 --> 01:55:02.811
People try to whip his ass every week.

1654
01:55:02.895 --> 01:55:05.230
- Fuckin' kid won't back down.
- What are you sayin' about me?

1655
01:55:05.314 --> 01:55:08.817
- Was I talkin' to you?
- Then mind your fuckin' business.

1656
01:55:08.901 --> 01:55:12.154
- Go get me a beer.
- I ordered two beers!

1657
01:55:12.238 --> 01:55:14.323
- Hey, asshole.
- What, bitch?

1658
01:55:14.407 --> 01:55:18.119
- Happy birthday.
- Thought we forgot, huh, bitch?

1659
01:55:18.202 --> 01:55:20.829
- Come on!
- I'm goin'. I'm goin'.

1660
01:55:20.913 --> 01:55:22.789
All right. Who's first?

1661
01:55:22.873 --> 01:55:25.375
- Come on, motherfucker!
- Who's first?

1662
01:55:25.459 --> 01:55:27.294
<i>Oh, Danny boy</i>

1663
01:55:27.378 --> 01:55:29.296
Here's your present.

1664
01:55:31.090 --> 01:55:33.050
- Come on, bro.
- What?

1665
01:55:33.134 --> 01:55:37.388
We knew you had to get back and
forth to Cambridge for your new job.

1666
01:55:37.471 --> 01:55:41.349
I knew I wasn't gonna
fuckin' drive you every day, so—

1667
01:55:41.434 --> 01:55:45.479
- Morgan wanted to get you a “T” pass.
- That's not what I was sayin'!

1668
01:55:45.563 --> 01:55:48.065
But, you're 21 now.

1669
01:55:48.149 --> 01:55:51.694
You're legally allowed to drink, so we
figured the best thing for ya was a car.

1670
01:55:51.777 --> 01:55:54.237
- How do you like it?
- This is like—

1671
01:55:56.699 --> 01:56:00.619
It's the ugliest fuckin' car
I've ever seen in my life.

1672
01:56:00.703 --> 01:56:02.621
- Come on, brother.
- How'd you guys do this?

1673
01:56:02.705 --> 01:56:07.205
You know, me and Bill
scraped together the parts...

1674
01:56:07.835 --> 01:56:09.878
and Morgan was out panhandlin'
for change every day.

1675
01:56:09.962 --> 01:56:11.880
I had the router to do all the bodywork.

1676
01:56:11.964 --> 01:56:13.882
Yeah, hell of a fuckin' job, too, brother.

1677
01:56:13.966 --> 01:56:16.510
Guy's been up my ass for two years about a job.
I had to let him help with the car.

1678
01:56:16.594 --> 01:56:18.512
So you finally got a job, huh, Morgan?

1679
01:56:18.596 --> 01:56:20.723
- Yeah, had one. Now I'm fucked again.
- So what is it?

1680
01:56:20.806 --> 01:56:23.600
- A lawn mower? What do ya got?
- It's a straight fuckin' six.

1681
01:56:23.684 --> 01:56:25.435
Me and Bill rebuilt
this engine ourselves here.

1682
01:56:25.519 --> 01:56:29.689
It's a good car.
The engine's good. Engine's good.

1683
01:56:29.773 --> 01:56:33.067
- Happy 21, Will.
- Happy 21, brother.

1684
01:56:40.201 --> 01:56:42.077
Hi.

1685
01:56:43.579 --> 01:56:45.581
Come on in.

1686
01:56:47.708 --> 01:56:49.626
Sean, I—

1687
01:56:49.710 --> 01:56:51.795
Me too, Gerry.

1688
01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:55.215
Yeah. Good.

1689
01:56:56.300 --> 01:56:58.385
I heard you're takin' some time.

1690
01:56:58.469 --> 01:57:02.969
Yeah. Travel a little bit, maybe write.

1691
01:57:03.182 --> 01:57:05.142
So where are you going?

1692
01:57:05.226 --> 01:57:09.188
India and China and Baltimore.

1693
01:57:12.608 --> 01:57:14.610
You know when you'll be back?

1694
01:57:16.320 --> 01:57:18.030
I got this flyer the other day.

1695
01:57:18.113 --> 01:57:20.990
It says class of '72
is having a reunion in six months.

1696
01:57:21.075 --> 01:57:22.993
Yeah, I got one of those too.

1697
01:57:23.077 --> 01:57:24.953
Why don't you come? I'll buy ya a drink.

1698
01:57:25.037 --> 01:57:27.914
The drinks at those things are free.

1699
01:57:29.083 --> 01:57:31.543
I know, Gerry. I was being ironical.

1700
01:57:37.967 --> 01:57:39.635
How about a drink right now?

1701
01:57:40.928 --> 01:57:42.846
Yeah. It's a good idea.

1702
01:57:42.930 --> 01:57:45.307
Come on. This one's on me.

1703
01:57:48.102 --> 01:57:50.479
I got the winner right here, pal.

1704
01:57:50.563 --> 01:57:53.857
Yes, sir, this is the one.

1705
01:57:53.941 --> 01:57:56.234
This is my ticket to paradise.

1706
01:57:56.318 --> 01:57:58.403
Do you know what the odds
are against winning the lottery?

1707
01:57:58.487 --> 01:58:01.531
- What? Four to one?
- About 30 million to one.

1708
01:58:01.615 --> 01:58:03.700
I still have a shot, you know?

1709
01:58:03.784 --> 01:58:07.537
Yes, just about as big chance
as you being hit by lightning...

1710
01:58:07.621 --> 01:58:09.664
here on the staircase right now.

1711
01:58:09.748 --> 01:58:12.959
It's a possibility too. I mean, 32 million.
If you look at the size—

1712
01:59:42.466 --> 01:59:44.843
Will!

1713
02:00:03.904 --> 02:00:05.864
Will?

1714
02:01:13.098 --> 02:01:14.974
He's not there.

1715
02:01:36.079 --> 02:01:39.332
<i>Sean, if the professor
calls about that job...</i>

1716
02:01:39.416 --> 02:01:43.916
<i>Just tell him,
sorry, I had to go see about a girl.</i>

1717
02:01:44.087 --> 02:01:46.005
<i>Will.</i>

1718
02:01:47.633 --> 02:01:50.969
Son of a bitch. He stole my line.
