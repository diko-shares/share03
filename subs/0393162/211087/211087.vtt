1
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.880
Yeah! Nice job! Nice pass!

2
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.040
<i>St. Francis High School
basketball phenom</i>

3
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.400
Ty Crane,
who they recruited just last year,

4
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.680
is widely held as
the next LeBron James.

5
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.040
We simply know him
as "The Crane. "

6
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.600
Come on.

7
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.440
Come on, y'all!
Timo, let's go man, come on.

8
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.800
Yeah, whatever.

9
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.840
Where you at? Where you at?

10
00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.400
Pick him up! Pick him up!

11
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.720
- Hey, son.
- Hey.

12
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.080
Right here, right here.

13
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.680
- Blue ball!
- Good D, baby!

14
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.440
- Damn!
- What the hell are you doing, y'all?

15
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.520
- You took three steps this way.
- Yo, I put my fist up, man.

16
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.960
Yo, homey, look where you're throwing
the ball, man. Damn.

17
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.360
- Get your man!
- I knew it. I knew it.

18
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.400
Yeah!

19
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.320
St. Francis is up by 22.

20
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.600
Stay out of my way, bitch.
I own you.

21
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.640
- Oh, hell no!
- Bitch!

22
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.680
Let's go! Let's go!

23
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.160
Oh, no. Come on, guys, stop that!

24
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.320
- Let me go!
- Hey! Hey!

25
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.560
I'm good. Get off me!

26
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.360
Get off me, get off me!

27
00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.720
That's it! Game's over!

28
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.080
Game's over!

29
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.600
Crane. Great game, great game.

30
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.680
Tell everyone out there what it
feels like to be the next LeBron James.

31
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.280
LeBron James?
I'm the only Ty Crane.

32
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.560
All right, you heard it here first,
"the only Ty Crane. "

33
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.160
Why do all the benchwarmers
always got something to say?

34
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.720
We watching the damn game,
that's why.

35
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.360
- You got a good view, huh?
- Yeah.

36
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.440
Ty Crane outscored
our whole team by himself.

37
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.920
- Wonder how that happened.
- We had nothing but 32 points.

38
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.920
I got 12 of them.
What did you get, Kenyon?

39
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.840
Just shut up, dog.
The Crane swooped down on you

40
00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.080
and delivered a basket of beat-down.
He clowned you, dog.

41
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.880
- Yeah, you better shut the hell up.
- He had you on lock the whole game.

42
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.440
Lyle, why don't you shut your mouth
before I close it for good.

43
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.080
You didn't do shit either
the whole game.

44
00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.160
What, homey?
I will slap the taste out your mouth!

45
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.320
- Can we all just get along?
- Shut your little ass up!

46
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.480
- You didn't even play!
- That's what I'm talking about.

47
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.320
- Shay, pass the ball, dog!
- You got two points in 16 minutes,

48
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.560
- that's why coach got rid of your ass.
- Exactly!

49
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.120
Timo, you was in the whole time,
you never even touched the rock.

50
00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.880
You didn't do shit.
You might as well...

51
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.240
- Who was you passing the ball to?
- You were playing and didn't do shit!

52
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.840
Kenny Ray Carter, Richmond
High School all-American, 1972.

53
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.720
Good to see you, sir.

54
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.000
I was really happy to see you
in the stands tonight.

55
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.360
I have to tell you, sir,
I haven't made up my mind yet.

56
00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.360
As I've told you,
it's time for me to step down.

57
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.760
Last few years
have been really tough.

58
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.840
Well, losing's hard, sir.

59
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.800
This isn't about
losing games, Kenny.

60
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.080
I can't get them to show up
for school, for practice.

61
00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.600
I can't get parents involved, and I'm
done chasing kids in the streets

62
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.240
and pulling them into the gym.

63
00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.960
Yeah, it's a tough job.

64
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.240
Richmond is a tough little city.

65
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.720
When I saw you here tonight,
I thought, "I got him. He's in. "

66
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.680
Well, actually,
I was here for another reason.

67
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.400
My son plays for St. Francis.

68
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.040
He does?

69
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.120
- Which kid was he?
- Well, you didn't see him.

70
00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.440
- He's a freshman. He didn't play.
- That's great. Great school.

71
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.040
What, you wanna go?

72
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.400
- Hey!
- Lyle, bring it!

73
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.680
Let him go. You think everybody's
scared of you? I ain't scared of you!

74
00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.040
Cruz, chill, man. Why you gotta be
trying to act all hard all the time, man?

75
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.560
God, I'm sick of you, man!

76
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.120
You know, that school was rough
when I went there.

77
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.680
It's way beyond that now.

78
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.480
Well, then, just forget about it.
Don't even discuss it again.

79
00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.640
I can't quite do that. Coach officially
offered me the job tonight.

80
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.000
The clock's ticking.

81
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.920
And when you say "offering job,"
there's usually money involved.

82
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.360
Yeah, there might be
a thousand bucks in it for me.

83
00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.880
For five months of work?

84
00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.920
Oh, well, you can't say no to that.

85
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.280
And the team, it's so bad.

86
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.160
Those boys,
they're so angry and undisciplined.

87
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.240
And besides, you know,
you don't have the time.

88
00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.840
You're trying to open up
a second store.

89
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.360
Exactly, I don't have the...
Hell, I don't have any time.

90
00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.480
And you promised to take
your girlfriend to Mexico.

91
00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.120
And I'm definitely
keeping that promise.

92
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.440
There's no way
I'm not going to Mexico

93
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.560
and hanging out on the beach
with you in your bikini.

94
00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:05.920
I can't take that job.

95
00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.720
So when do you start?

96
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.920
- You should've spoken to me first.
- Why?

97
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.320
- It was a personal choice for me.
- So, what happens to me?

98
00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.000
You still gonna come to my games?

99
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.920
I'll probably miss most of
your games, Damien. I'm sorry.

100
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.560
Then I'll go to Richmond
and play for you.

101
00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:25.920
No.

102
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.680
Well, why not?

103
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.360
- Dad, you've always been my coach.
- This is a great school, Damien.

104
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.280
It puts you in a great position
for college.

105
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.880
Dad, I'm a freshman!

106
00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.600
Just because I'm coaching
at Richmond,

107
00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.160
it doesn't change our plans
for your future, all right?

108
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.000
Yo, my man, I need a vial, man.
You got that good dope? How much?

109
00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.240
You forgot to bring your ID,
didn't you?

110
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.400
- I forgot it.
- Every day.

111
00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.320
Good morning. Ken Carter.

112
00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.120
- Thanks.
- Here you go, sir.

113
00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.760
Hey, yo, what's up?

114
00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.040
- Nice to see you again, Mr. Carter.
- You too, ma'am.

115
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:48.320
If the offer still stands,
I'd like to coach the team.

116
00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:53.080
Well, I hope you're up for the task.
These young men need discipline.

117
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.720
The job comes with a $1,500 stipend

118
00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.880
and a major time commitment
for the next four months.

119
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.960
- I accept.
- Great.

120
00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.600
We're thrilled to have you.
Gentlemen, I hate to be abrupt,

121
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.920
but I do have a budget meeting
I need to run to.

122
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.160
Mr. Carter, is there anything
you need from us?

123
00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:13.520
Well, I just need about
25 copies of this document.

124
00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.240
- I'm all set.
- Ray, would you see to it

125
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.520
that Mr. Carter...?
Coach Carter gets these copies?

126
00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.080
- Will do.
- Gentlemen.

127
00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.880
I'm not saying this is
not gonna be a challenge,

128
00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.480
but, Kenny, you know the deal here.

129
00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.520
Just keep in mind,
these are good boys.

130
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.920
Guys! Guys!

131
00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.640
Guys!

132
00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:40.000
Now, as you know, I've been... Hey!

133
00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.680
You know I've been looking
for a new coach

134
00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.920
to take over for me this season.

135
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.480
This is Ken Carter.
He went to Richmond.

136
00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.120
He was a two-sport all-American.

137
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.480
Still holds records
for scoring, assists, steals.

138
00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.960
Basketball scholarship to
George Mason University.

139
00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.200
We're lucky to have Coach Carter.

140
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.280
Now, let's give him
the respect he's due.

141
00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.800
- They're all yours, coach.
- Thank you, sir.

142
00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.680
Good afternoon, young men.

143
00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:14.560
As Coach White said, I'm your
new basketball coach, Ken Carter.

144
00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.400
I guess I need to speak louder
so you can hear me.

145
00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.920
I'm Ken Carter,
your new basketball coach.

146
00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.280
We hear you, dog.
But we can't see you.

147
00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.920
The glare from your
big, black-ass head

148
00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.000
is hella shiny, man.
Damn, do you buff it?

149
00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.440
Oh, you got jokes to go along
with that ugly jump shot of yours, huh?

150
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.920
First of all, if you need to know
my credentials,

151
00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.360
as Coach White said,
they're on the wall there behind you.

152
00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:44.920
Secondly, if basketball practice
starts at 3, you are late as of 2:55.

153
00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.480
You, shooting the ball.
What's your name, sir?

154
00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.520
Jason Lyle, but I ain't no sir.

155
00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.040
You're not a sir.

156
00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.200
Well, are you a madam?

157
00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:01.360
- Little bitch. Bitch.
- As of now, you are a sir.

158
00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.200
So are the rest of you.

159
00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.840
"Sir" is a term of respect.

160
00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:09.480
And you will have my respect
until you abuse it.

161
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.920
Mr. Lyle, how many games
did you guys win last season?

162
00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.120
Like four wins, 22 losses.

163
00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.480
- Sir.
- Sir.

164
00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.040
I'm going to give you contracts.

165
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.640
If you sign and honor
your side of them,

166
00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.920
we are going to be successful.

167
00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.480
Damn, do I get a signing bonus
for signing this contract?

168
00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:38.280
Yes, sir.
You get to become a winner.

169
00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:42.280
Because if there's one thing I know,
it is this:

170
00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:45.080
The losing stops now.

171
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.440
Starting today, you will play
like winners, act like winners,

172
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:53.320
and most importantly,
you will be winners.

173
00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:56.880
If you listen and learn,
you'll win basketball games.

174
00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:00.240
And, gentlemen, winning in here...

175
00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.840
...is the key to winning out there.

176
00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:07.560
This contract states that you will
maintain a 2.3 grade point average.

177
00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.520
You will attend all your classes

178
00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.360
and you will sit in the front row
of those classes.

179
00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:15.120
- Yo, this a country-ass nigga, dog.
- Excuse me.

180
00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.880
- Did you say something, sir?
- Worm was wondering,

181
00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.880
are you some country church nigga,
with your tie on and all that?

182
00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.600
- Right.
- That's what you wanna say, right?

183
00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.000
And what is your name, sir?

184
00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.120
I'm Timo Cruz, sir.

185
00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.400
Well, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Worm,

186
00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.880
what you should both know
is we treat ourselves with respect.

187
00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.440
We don't use the word "nigga. "

188
00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.480
Are you some preacher man
or some shit?

189
00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.800
Because God ain't gonna do you
no good in this neighborhood.

190
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
- I live in this neighborhood, sir.
- Sir.

191
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.080
Can you believe
this uppity Negro, sir?

192
00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.160
Okay, Mr. Cruz...

193
00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.600
...leave the gym right now.
- For what?

194
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:56.480
I'll ask you one last time
to leave the gym

195
00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:00.040
- before I help you leave.
- Before you what?

196
00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:02.760
Do you even know who I am?

197
00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:06.360
From what I can see, a very confused
and scared young man.

198
00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:09.840
Scared of who? Scared of you?
I'm supposed to be scared of you?

199
00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.960
Nigga, I ain't scared of nobody.
I will lay your ass out.

200
00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.360
I don't think so.

201
00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.560
All right.

202
00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.160
What you doing? Get off me!

203
00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.960
Teachers ain't supposed
to touch students.

204
00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.880
I'm not a teacher.

205
00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.400
I'm your new basketball coach.

206
00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.840
This ain't over!

207
00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.560
Is there anybody else
who's not feeling this contract?

208
00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.000
Come on, man, where you going?

209
00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.320
I don't do high school contracts.

210
00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:14.920
Tell us when you need
the real ballers.

211
00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.120
I will do that, sir.

212
00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.720
There goes our two leading scorers
from last season, man.

213
00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.920
Then I guess we'll have new
leading scorers this season, huh?

214
00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.800
Now, I cannot teach you the game
of basketball

215
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.840
until your conditioning is at a level
that allows me to do so.

216
00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.080
Gentlemen, report to the baseline.

217
00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.200
To the baseline!

218
00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.000
I presume you all know
what suicides are.

219
00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.360
So...

220
00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.440
I saw the St. Francis game
the other night.

221
00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.560
None of you have a problem
shooting the ball.

222
00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:06.280
You all had a problem
getting up and down the court.

223
00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:10.040
If you are late, you will run.

224
00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:13.920
If you give me attitude,
you will do push-ups.

225
00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:17.120
So you can push-up or shut up.

226
00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.720
That's up to you.

227
00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.240
- Yo, how many we gonna do?
- Sir.

228
00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.800
Yo, sir, how many we gonna do?

229
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.840
Let's see how many you can do
in one hour and seven minutes.

230
00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.280
Fellas, don't make me
commit homicide.

231
00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:36.840
I said, suicides!
Put your hand on the line!

232
00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.800
Put your hand on the line!

233
00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:45.720
Damn, I can't keep this shit up, man.
I can barely walk.

234
00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:49.240
- I know, my legs is hella sore, son.
- Need some Gatorade or something.

235
00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:53.240
- There go your girl right there, son.
- Yeah.

236
00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.880
Hey, what's with you and her homeys?
You gonna try to holler at them?

237
00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.200
Man, I'm hollering
at both of the friends.

238
00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.920
- Both of them?
- Yeah, because I need that.

239
00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:03.000
You know, I need variety in my life.
I can't just have one girl.

240
00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.520
You know what I'm saying?
I need both.

241
00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:05.880
Hey.

242
00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.280
- What's up, baby?
- How you doing?

243
00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:10.520
Ladies, ladies, ladies. Y'all heard
about that two-for-one special, right?

244
00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:14.440
Two of you, one of me.
Now, that's special.

245
00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.200
- Please. Whatever, Worm.
- Yeah, special ed.

246
00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:19.920
- Get your arm off me.
- I like this fox.

247
00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.480
You working that chinchilla.
But, look, baby, me and you...

248
00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:26.080
You need to tell him to stop playing it
so close. She don't even like him.

249
00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:31.000
- Why not? Worm's the man.
- Worm is Worm.

250
00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:37.040
Anyway, I got something
for the baby today.

251
00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.760
We don't even know if it's a baby yet.
I mean, it's kind of early.

252
00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.600
You ain't even been
to the doctor yet.

253
00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:54.680
Hello? I passed the pregnancy test,
Kenyon. Three times.

254
00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:04.520
- These are kind of cute, though.
- I know, I got good taste, right?

255
00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.120
Yeah, all right.

256
00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.200
Precious little shoes.

257
00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:11.360
Well, I got a little
somethin'-somethin' for you too.

258
00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.040
Thank you.

259
00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.880
This definitely is a little something.

260
00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:24.040
- Where'd you get this?
- Don't sleep on the 99 Cent Store.

261
00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:26.680
Kenyon!

262
00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:29.040
- What? What's up?
- What are you doing? Give me!

263
00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.000
- Are you crazy?
- Are you crazy?

264
00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.680
You got that for 99 cents?
I've been there.

265
00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:35.720
You can get three brooms and a bucket
for 99 cents, with some toilet paper.

266
00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:38.720
That's like thread.
That's not even half a shoelace.

267
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.320
Well, would you like to see me
in this shoelace?

268
00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.080
Quick feet! Let me see quick feet!

269
00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.880
Touch the floor! Stay big! Stay big!

270
00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.600
Three push-ups and move.
One! Two! Three!

271
00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.520
Let's go. Explode!

272
00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.880
Let me hear you. Let me hear you!
Let me hear it.

273
00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.200
Explode! Worm, explode!

274
00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:01.680
Touch the floor! Touch the floor!

275
00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:03.880
Give me five!
Just give me five! Push!

276
00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:06.960
Push! Go! Go!
Let me hear you!

277
00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:10.240
Come on, close out!
Explode! Let's go!

278
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.360
Sir, you're 20 minutes late.

279
00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:20.680
That's ten suicides for the
whole team, 250 push-ups for you.

280
00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.280
This ain't the track team, man.

281
00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.800
Nor is it the debate team, Mr. Lyle.

282
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.400
But you're right.

283
00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:30.600
And because you're right,
that's 20 suicides for the entire team

284
00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.840
and you get the privilege
of joining Mr. Battle

285
00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:35.760
- with 250 push-ups of your own.
- What, are you serious?

286
00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.640
- Yeah.
- This is bullshit!

287
00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.320
Good answer, Mr. Battle.

288
00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.000
Johnny, tell him what he's won.

289
00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.560
Because you gave
such a good answer

290
00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:46.240
and you gave the coach attitude,

291
00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:49.800
you win the bonus prize
of 500 push-ups!

292
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:53.120
And would you like to go
for the grand prize of a thousand?

293
00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.400
No, sir.

294
00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:01.200
To the baseline!
On my whistle! Let's go!

295
00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.080
J.B., come on, baby.

296
00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.000
I can't even move, son.
Like, every muscle on my body hurts.

297
00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:09.040
- You can't say nothing to him.
- Why can't I say nothing to him?

298
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.400
I'm a white boy? Man, what the...?

299
00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.560
Right here. Right here.
Get this dude right here. Get this dude.

300
00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:16.840
Where you going, homey?
Where you going, huh?

301
00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.160
- I ain't got shit.
- What?

302
00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.720
Please don't shoot me, man.
Go on, take my bag, dog!

303
00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:22.800
Run your shit, homey!

304
00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:30.920
That's some bullshit, Cruz!

305
00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:33.520
Yo, I'm gonna visit you in County, dog.

306
00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.280
I'm just playing, B.
Look at you!

307
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.480
Damn! I seen y'all
walking from up the block

308
00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.040
like somebody put a pipe
in your asses.

309
00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.200
You all right, dog?

310
00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:47.920
Look, y'all wasn't winning with me,

311
00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:50.560
but y'all damn sure
look sad without me.

312
00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:52.720
But you know what?
I'm gonna watch y'all play.

313
00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:54.320
See y'all get your asses kicked.

314
00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:58.600
Yo! I'd love to shoot the shit with
you bitches all night, but I gotta go.

315
00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.000
- All right.
- Yo, who that, man?

316
00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.880
That's my cousin, Renny.

317
00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.560
I'm gonna check y'all.
Come on, let's go.

318
00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:06.640
Yo, Worm, you need a ride?

319
00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.120
- No, I'm straight, man.
- You sure?

320
00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.080
- Yeah, I'm good.
- All right, my nigga.

321
00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:12.360
- One love.
- All right, Lyle!

322
00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:16.360
Don't let nobody else put a pipe
up your ass, or you might like it!

323
00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:22.960
Hey, you was scared, huh?
I wasn't scared.

324
00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.720
The state only requires
that they have a 2.0 average to play.

325
00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:27.360
Now, you got in here
they need a 2.3.

326
00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:30.720
If you have a 2.0, you have to score
at least 1050 on the SAT

327
00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.320
to be eligible
for an athletic scholarship.

328
00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.680
If you have a 2.3,
you only need 950.

329
00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.440
Now, 2.3 is just a C-plus.

330
00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.520
It shouldn't be that hard
to maintain a C-plus.

331
00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:45.000
These boys are student athletes.

332
00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.080
"Student" comes first.

333
00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.640
It says they gotta wear
coat and ties on game days.

334
00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:53.280
They don't own ties!
You gonna supply the ties?

335
00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:55.440
There's a Goodwill
and a Salvation Army store

336
00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:57.600
less than two blocks from here.

337
00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.160
They got a box full of ties
for 50 cents apiece.

338
00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:02.120
Yo, man, what you
trying to say, huh?

339
00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:05.640
Oh, we too good to shop at the
Goodwill and Salvation Army, is that it?

340
00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.160
- Yeah, I ain't that broke.
- This is crazy!

341
00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:11.120
A dress code and they have to sit
in the front row in class?

342
00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:15.880
- This is basketball, man!
- And basketball is a privilege, ma'am.

343
00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:18.920
If you want to play basketball
on this team,

344
00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.720
these are the simple rules
you have to follow

345
00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.520
if you want to enjoy that privilege.

346
00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:27.920
Now, if you decide
to follow these simple rules,

347
00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:31.800
I need you and the boys
to sign this contract.

348
00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:35.760
They can bring the contracts
to practice tomorrow.

349
00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.800
If you come to practice.

350
00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:41.040
I wanna thank you all for coming out
and showing your support,

351
00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.040
and I hope I have your support
the rest of the season.

352
00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:46.920
- Good night.
- Get up and leave like that?

353
00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:50.200
Look, I have a hard enough time
getting my nephew to...

354
00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.480
- How you gonna make them wear ties?
- I want the other coach back!

355
00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:10.120
It's one of your contracts, sir.
I've amended that contract.

356
00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:13.440
You require your players
to maintain a 2.3 grade point average.

357
00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:16.200
I've committed to maintaining a 3.5.

358
00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:19.480
You require ten hours of community
service, and I've committed to 50.

359
00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:23.720
Any unexcused absences, any other
disciplinary issues at school,

360
00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:26.920
you can nullify this agreement
and send me to any school you want.

361
00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:31.000
And how many days do I have
to consider this offer?

362
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.520
None.

363
00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.240
The second page
is a letter you need to sign

364
00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.440
that confirms my withdrawal
from St. Francis.

365
00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:38.960
- They know I'm leaving.
- What?

366
00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:41.600
- You withdrew from St. Francis?
- I called Richmond.

367
00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:44.400
- They expect me there in the morning.
- You called Richmond?

368
00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.520
You should have spoken to me
about this.

369
00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:49.720
It was a personal choice for me.

370
00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:55.200
Well, I can fix all that in the morning.

371
00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.920
Sir, please listen.
All I wanna do is play for you.

372
00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:01.040
If I'm one of the top students
at Richmond,

373
00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:04.680
I mean one of the top in the whole
school, and I have great SATs,

374
00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:07.080
I can go to any college
in the country.

375
00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.760
I'm asking you to trust me.

376
00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.960
You really wanna do this, huh?

377
00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:20.720
Okay.

378
00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:23.280
Part of growing up
is making your own decisions

379
00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:26.120
and living with the consequences.

380
00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.040
3.7.

381
00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:37.200
And you will earn every minute
of playing time.

382
00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.640
Open it, please.

383
00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:44.000
Morning, sir.

384
00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:50.800
<i>My name is J. Lyle
They call me wild</i>

385
00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:54.640
<i>It's all right
Kenyon's mom tonight</i>

386
00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:56.840
<i>- Say what?
- You might think I'm wrong</i>

387
00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.160
<i>But she's got these thongs</i>

388
00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:02.760
Hey, yo, yo, yo.
It's Malcolm X from St. Francis.

389
00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:04.520
- Hey, yo, Malcolm!
- Whatever.

390
00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.920
- What's up, man?
- What are you doing here, son?

391
00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.560
- I transferred to Richmond.
- Oh, no, son, I think you're just lost.

392
00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:13.120
Well, I am actually lost.
Can you tell me how to get to?

393
00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:16.480
Bel Air? Hey, yo, Worm,
tell your man Fresh Prince here

394
00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:19.520
- how to get to his mansion.
- Fresh bitch.

395
00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:26.320
I hope seeing you in this hallway mean
I get to see you on the court today.

396
00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:31.400
I can't wait. With your five browns.

397
00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:34.960
Everybody up.

398
00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.200
Today we're going to play defense.

399
00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.080
Sorry, sir.

400
00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:46.120
Gentlemen, this is a new player,
Damien Carter.

401
00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.920
He is my son, and he is late.

402
00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:51.480
Sir, you owe me 20 suicides.

403
00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.400
Sir, it's my first day of school,
I had to stay...

404
00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.440
Basketball practice starts at 3.

405
00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:59.120
As of 2:55, you are late.
Get changed in the locker room.

406
00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:03.080
Do your suicides on the far side
of the court so as not to disturb us.

407
00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:05.480
All right, gentlemen,
give me two lines!

408
00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:09.960
Okay, young sirs, we're gonna
take it to the next level.

409
00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:13.200
Everything I knew about basketball,

410
00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:15.200
I learned from women.

411
00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:19.240
I have a sister, her name's Diane.

412
00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:23.520
She was always on my case
about every little thing.

413
00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:26.120
Matter of fact, she still is.

414
00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:29.480
"Turn down that radio!
You eat the last piece of cake?

415
00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:31.560
Did you drink all the Kool-Aid?"

416
00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.920
She was always in my face.

417
00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:37.200
So when I call "Diane,"

418
00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:40.920
we're gonna play straight
man-to-man pressure defense.

419
00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.880
Worm! No, no, no, no, sir.

420
00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.320
Look at your defensive posture.

421
00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.680
Come on. Split your man.
Back straight, butt down.

422
00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:55.800
This hand guards against the passing
lane, this hand protects the crossover.

423
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.680
All right? Palms up!
Get your head in the game.

424
00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:01.480
Now we have Delilah.

425
00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:03.960
She was my childhood sweetheart.

426
00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.520
Sir, was she hot?

427
00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:10.120
Oh, yes, sir.
She was steaming hot.

428
00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:15.640
But she was the devil.
That girl was evil.

429
00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.800
I remember once she tricked me
into stealing brownies

430
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.280
from Christ the King
First Baptist Church bake sale.

431
00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.520
She smiled
and got her way out of it,

432
00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:27.400
while I damn near had to wear
a pillow on my butt

433
00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.160
for a month
before I could sit down.

434
00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:32.840
Delilah, gentlemen.
She's our trap defense.

435
00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:37.280
Take notes, freshman. This is as
close as you gonna get to playing.

436
00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:42.880
Come on, come on. Move, move!
Delilah! Delilah! Delilah!

437
00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.640
Now, I know you're all
concerned that

438
00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:54.960
we didn't work
on our offense during practice.

439
00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:57.120
We have all season to do that.

440
00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:00.480
But what did we do in practice,
Mr. Stone?

441
00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:02.920
- Run.
- That's right.

442
00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:05.560
So, what do you think I want you
to do on offense tonight?

443
00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:08.040
- Run?
- Correct again.

444
00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:10.400
I want you to run.

445
00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:15.520
<i>I want you to run every second
that clock is ticking, all game long.</i>

446
00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.440
Put him back on the bench!

447
00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:27.680
Rebound! Rebound!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

448
00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.400
Nice pass, baby!

449
00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:37.080
Push it! Push it!

450
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.640
- Screen.
- Screen, baby. Screen. Screen.

451
00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:41.840
- Worm.
- Let's go, Worm.

452
00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.400
Stay alert! Pick him up right there!

453
00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.840
- Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
- What's the call, ref?

454
00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.720
White four, fifth.
He's out of the game.

455
00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:59.120
- Oh, ref, come...
- That's his fifth foul, coach.

456
00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:01.160
- Time, sir.
- Time out, white.

457
00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:03.720
Bad call, ref!
That was a jump ball, damn it!

458
00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:05.480
- Time out, white.
- Come on, fellas.

459
00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:08.120
Come on, huddle up. Hustle up.
Get over here.

460
00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:09.640
All right. Huddle up, huddle up.

461
00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:12.680
- Carter, you're in.
- But, coach, he a freshman.

462
00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.560
You wanna coach?

463
00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.280
All right, take a deep breath, guys.
Come on, deep breaths.

464
00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:21.000
- You tired?
- No, sir.

465
00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:22.920
Those guys are exhausted.

466
00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:24.920
That's why this guy's gonna miss
that free throw.

467
00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:28.040
When he does,
Worm and Lyle are our first option.

468
00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:31.400
Push the ball. Go hard to the hole.
Everybody attack the boards, got that?

469
00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:33.640
- Yes, sir.
- All right, Richmond on three.

470
00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.720
- One, two, three!
- Richmond!

471
00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.440
- All right, let's out, all right?
- Step it up, let's go!

472
00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.400
Look alive out there.

473
00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:44.840
All right, guys, you're in better shape
than they are. Push it.

474
00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:48.480
Box out, box out.

475
00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:49.960
One shot.

476
00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:57.960
Kenyon, right here. Kenyon!

477
00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.800
- Come on! Come on!
- Come on, baby!

478
00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:09.480
All right.

479
00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:16.080
Kenyon!

480
00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:19.320
- Worm!
- Yo, yo.

481
00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:22.280
Oh, yeah!

482
00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:25.680
Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!

483
00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:36.160
- Tight pass, baby. Nice pass, dog.
- It was all you.

484
00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:37.600
A win like that don't mean nothing,

485
00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:39.320
because they can't play anyway,
you feel me?

486
00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:46.560
Okay, Shaq, so you dominated
down low tonight. Any thoughts?

487
00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:50.400
I dropped a 20-piece.
Kobe played his game.

488
00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.680
We the champions
till we ain't the champions no more.

489
00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:55.560
- Junior Battle.
- Undefeated until...

490
00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.400
Yo, man, on the real,

491
00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.400
that was the worst game
I've ever seen in my life.

492
00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:01.960
I thought that shit would never end.
I was dying in the bleachers.

493
00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:04.040
That's right, you were in
the bleachers, weren't you?

494
00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:05.720
We were on the court
handling our business.

495
00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:08.040
That's right. We 1-0, bitch.

496
00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:11.720
Yo, on the real, Hercules is weak, B,
and y'all barely beat them.

497
00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.680
Damn, Timo,
why you throwing salt, man?

498
00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:16.440
We undefeated. Show us love, son.

499
00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.440
Yeah, that's right, we undefeated.

500
00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:20.520
I'll knock all y'all off.

501
00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:53.240
- Yo. I'll check y'all later, all right?
- All right.

502
00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:55.880
Yo. Let's do this.

503
00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:04.800
- What's up?
- Here's two bundles.

504
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.640
- All right.
- Yo, be careful. The block is hot.

505
00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:09.280
Yo, I got you.

506
00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.600
- How you doing, man?
- Chilling, man.

507
00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:14.600
You look good.

508
00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:16.040
Got some paper for you.

509
00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:20.440
Now we're talking, yeah.

510
00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:24.840
How you living, Timo?

511
00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:28.040
I'm good.

512
00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:31.600
- You all right? For real?
- Yeah.

513
00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.800
- Here, take some.
- I'm all right.

514
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.840
No, no, no, take some, please.

515
00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:40.720
You did good, man.
You're doing good, bro.

516
00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:45.280
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me, thank you.

517
00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.000
You earned it.

518
00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:52.160
Take a nickel bag, okay?

519
00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:55.280
Go get yourself something, man.

520
00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:59.720
- I'm gonna see you?
- Yeah, next week.

521
00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:01.000
Okay, I'm gonna see you.

522
00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:03.640
- Keep it up.
- Yeah.

523
00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.640
<i>Hey, Shaqua, Denise, holler at me.</i>

524
00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:24.720
Rafeca, I see you looking.

525
00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:27.720
Ain't nobody
thinking about you, Worm.

526
00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:29.720
- Oh, okay.
- Gentlemen,

527
00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:31.760
let's review the Hercules game,
shall we?

528
00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:33.720
Yo, yell out my numbers, sir.

529
00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:37.000
Mr. Worm, you were five and four.

530
00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.320
No, sir. I had 12 points
and eight assists, sir.

531
00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:43.800
No, sir, Mr. Worm. You had five
turnovers and four missed free throws.

532
00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:47.800
Now, we're talking
about fundamentals here.

533
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.360
Until we learn them, I'm adding
a practice every morning at 6 a. m.

534
00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:56.520
- Six a. M?
- We shot 56 percent at...

535
00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.720
Mr. Cruz.

536
00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:01.480
Are you lost, sir?

537
00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:03.080
What I gotta do to play?

538
00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:08.240
Mr. Cruz, you do not want to know
the answer to that question.

539
00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:10.560
Now, as I was saying,

540
00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:15.400
as a team,
we shot 56 percent from the line.

541
00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:18.280
From now on,
before you leave my gym,

542
00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:23.520
you must pay an exit price of 50
made free throws before you can go.

543
00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:25.480
- What?
- That's everybody.

544
00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:27.720
- Come on.
- That's a lot of free throws.

545
00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:32.360
Okay, Mr. Cruz.

546
00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:34.760
Before you can play on this team...

547
00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.800
...you owe me...

548
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:42.360
...2,500 push-ups...

549
00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:44.120
...and 1,000 suicides.

550
00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:45.960
- Damn.
- Damn.

551
00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:51.560
And they must be
completed by Friday.

552
00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:54.440
- He ain't finishing that by Friday.
- He ain't making that.

553
00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:58.440
Today's flavor: Offense.

554
00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:00.520
- Now we talking.
- Now, I have a sister.

555
00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:02.760
Her name is Linda.

556
00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:06.280
Linda is smart, she's political.

557
00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:08.600
Well, actually, she's radical.

558
00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.400
Linda's got a big Afro.

559
00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:15.320
Linda is our pick-and-roll offense.

560
00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:17.760
Before we get into that,
let's warm up.

561
00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:19.920
Give me a lay-up line.

562
00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.960
- Let's go.
- All right.

563
00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:23.720
Let's do it.

564
00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:26.560
- Damn, how many sisters he got?
- Who knows.

565
00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:28.520
- Come on, get two more over here.
- Break it out.

566
00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:31.880
- Let's go, guys.
- Energy, guys, energy.

567
00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:33.520
We got this, let's go.

568
00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:35.000
- I'm open.
- I got him, I got him.

569
00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:36.680
Right here, right here.
I'm open. I'm open.

570
00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:38.120
I'm sorry.

571
00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:39.320
- All right.
- Hey, hey, hey.

572
00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:40.560
- Come on.
- It's not my fault.

573
00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:41.920
- He was early.
- Hey.

574
00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.680
Yes, it's important to move
without the ball,

575
00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:47.560
but you gotta be patient
on the weak-side screen.

576
00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:51.640
Set up your man
and come off his shoulder hard. Okay?

577
00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:53.880
Okay. Switch it up.

578
00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:56.400
We got it, come on.
Let's go. Let's get it.

579
00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:59.440
- And call out them picks.
- Yeah, yeah, all right.

580
00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:04.560
What is your deepest fear,
Mr. Cruz?

581
00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:07.200
That you're inadequate?

582
00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:09.080
Give up, Mr. Cruz.

583
00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:13.240
Go home.

584
00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:19.280
All right, I want seven passes
before you shoot.

585
00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:22.080
- Seven.
- All right.

586
00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:25.240
- I got him. I got him.
- Get that ball in there.

587
00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:31.080
You know your task is impossible
before Friday, right?

588
00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:36.440
Move.

589
00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:38.640
Work it, work it.

590
00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.080
Run it back.

591
00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:05.480
What time your mom getting home?

592
00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:07.360
She doesn't get off for another hour.

593
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.800
Oh, that's Myles.

594
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.720
What?

595
00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:36.280
Say, "Hi, Uncle Kenyon. "

596
00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:38.160
Say, "Hi. "

597
00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:39.560
All right, don't worry about it.

598
00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:42.240
He'll go back to sleep
right after his bottle.

599
00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:43.600
Right, boo-boo?

600
00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:46.080
Yeah, probably in time
for your mom to get home.

601
00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:48.640
Or when your cousin get back
from getting her hair fried and dyed,

602
00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:51.400
like she can afford all that shit.
It's her baby anyway.

603
00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:54.680
Well, my mother had to work
a double shift,

604
00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.360
but they cut her overtime.

605
00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:58.760
And my cousin,
don't be trying to dis her.

606
00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:00.680
You said we'd be alone.
You call this alone?

607
00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:03.520
Well, that's why we need
our own spot.

608
00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:08.240
Did you turn this off?

609
00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:11.520
- Yeah, it was boiling.
- Oh, come on.

610
00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:13.480
Well, turn it down, not off.

611
00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:17.320
This is milk, butter and cheese.
We can't afford to waste this.

612
00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:19.760
And hold him up.

613
00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:29.000
Making the baby's bottle for Myles.

614
00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:31.040
All right, Myles, here we go.

615
00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:33.600
Gotta cool off a minute.

616
00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:41.920
Ever think about what you were
gonna do before you were pregnant?

617
00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:44.240
What you mean,
going to junior college?

618
00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:45.560
Yeah.

619
00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:48.160
I mean, yeah, I thought about it.

620
00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:51.240
I could go later, I guess.

621
00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:54.000
You have to get some work
after you have the baby.

622
00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:56.080
Me too.

623
00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:58.960
- So I'll work.
- How you gonna go to school?

624
00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:00.760
Why you asking me
all these questions?

625
00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:03.440
And you gotta put your hands
under his arm.

626
00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:06.360
You gotta sit him on your chest.
Hold him.

627
00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:09.800
- I am holding him.
- You ain't doing it right.

628
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.440
You gotta soothe him, Kenyon.

629
00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:13.120
Look...

630
00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:16.680
I don't know how to do this.

631
00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:19.480
You'll get it.

632
00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:22.040
Right?

633
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.720
Look, I gotta help my mom
with some stuff.

634
00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:32.160
- See you later, all right?
- All right.

635
00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:36.080
Call me later, okay?

636
00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.120
Later.

637
00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:43.200
All right, keep it riding on somebody.

638
00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:45.360
- Don't get lost in there.
- Move it. Move it.

639
00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:48.280
Stay with your man.

640
00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:51.040
- Box out, box out!
- Position.

641
00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:54.600
Guys...

642
00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:56.320
Up. Up.

643
00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:57.440
Hey, hey, hey.

644
00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:00.000
You don't get to your man, stand,
watch the ball.

645
00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:02.640
When the ball goes up,
get in good defensive position,

646
00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:05.640
get your body on your man
and explode to the ball.

647
00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:08.120
All right? Let's go.

648
00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:09.560
Run it. You got it.

649
00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:12.040
- Go on, do it.
- Forward pass. Forward pass.

650
00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:13.960
- Work it.
- There you go.

651
00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:17.200
Mrs. Fenton, the police are telling
a very different story.

652
00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:19.720
I wish you would.
Yes, ma'am, I'm here all week.

653
00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:21.920
Mr. Carter, how are the boys?

654
00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:24.400
Oh, they're great, ma'am. We're 1-0.

655
00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:25.960
Very good.

656
00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.360
How may I help you?

657
00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:31.240
Well, I had my boys sign contracts

658
00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:33.960
requiring them to meet
certain academic standards.

659
00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:36.680
Yes, I believe one of the faculty
members mentioned that.

660
00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:38.680
Very interesting scare tactic.

661
00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:42.600
Well, in order for that
to be successful,

662
00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:45.320
I need their teachers to fill out
weekly progress reports

663
00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:48.480
so I'll know how the boys
are doing in their classrooms.

664
00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:51.240
- Okay.
- Well, I haven't received anything

665
00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:52.600
from their teachers.

666
00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:59.240
I don't see how this ties in to your job
as the basketball coach, Mr. Carter.

667
00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:03.120
Well, I took this job with the
understanding I could do it my way.

668
00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:04.680
And you can.

669
00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:06.560
Our next faculty meeting
is in two weeks.

670
00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:08.120
I'll remember to bring it up.

671
00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:11.800
Why, that would be great.
Thank you, ma'am.

672
00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:14.760
Thank you, sir.

673
00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:19.160
Bring it in, guys.

674
00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:21.280
Let's go, hustle up.

675
00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:23.200
Yo, bring it in, y'all.

676
00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:26.240
All right, that's it for today.

677
00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:29.080
We have a game tomorrow,
so get some rest tonight.

678
00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:33.520
And remember,
ties and jackets tomorrow.

679
00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:36.000
Clyde.

680
00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:44.960
Mr. Cruz.

681
00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:49.800
I'm impressed with
what you've done.

682
00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:52.400
But you came up short.

683
00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:55.280
You owe me 80 suicides
and 500 push-ups.

684
00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:59.200
Please leave my gym.

685
00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:02.560
Thanks, Clyde.

686
00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:05.160
Gentlemen, see you tomorrow.

687
00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:09.480
I'll do push-ups for him.

688
00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:16.520
You said we're a team.

689
00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:20.240
One person struggles,
we all struggle.

690
00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:23.360
One player triumphs,
we all triumph, right?

691
00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:40.760
I'll do some.

692
00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:43.400
I'll run suicides too.

693
00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:20.200
I'll do some too.

694
00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:29.000
Clyde, keep count.

695
00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:33.000
Call me when they're done.

696
00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:39.320
<i>Defense! Defense!</i>

697
00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:41.480
Push it. Push it. Move, move!

698
00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:42.920
Let's go.

699
00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:44.680
Ball, ball, ball.

700
00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:47.880
Ball, ball, ball.

701
00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:49.960
- Yeah!
- Go.

702
00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:54.760
Move your feet, move your feet.

703
00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:56.800
Go, defense. Go.

704
00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:59.160
Good job. Good job.

705
00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:00.520
- Worm.
- White ball.

706
00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:04.680
Palms up, move your feet, right?
Come out. Come out. Come out.

707
00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:06.320
- Mr. Cruz!
- Good game, boy.

708
00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:10.920
Hey, hey.

709
00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:14.000
What is your deepest fear,
young man?

710
00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:17.240
Go on.

711
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.760
Why he keep saying that, "What's
your deepest fear?" What that mean?

712
00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:23.800
Come on, let's go.
Let's go. Let's go.

713
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.760
Move. Move. Move.

714
00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:28.680
No, one more pass.

715
00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:37.800
Hands up.

716
00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:24.000
Three points, Cruz!

717
00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:28.800
What the hell are you doing, Cruz?
You allergic to lay-ups?

718
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.160
You do that again and you're going
to be glued to the bench.

719
00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:36.760
- Swing it.
- Right here.

720
00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:43.200
Come on, last kick.

721
00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:45.760
Kick it in. Kick it in. Let's go.

722
00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:56.280
You can't guard me, can you?
What you gonna do?

723
00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:58.600
- Can't do nothing about it, can you?
- Delilah. Delilah.

724
00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:01.080
Come on, come on, come on.

725
00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:03.680
- Shot.
- Yeah, Jason.

726
00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:08.280
Kenyon, pose for me.

727
00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:11.840
- Smile.
- Kenyon! Maddux! Get back!

728
00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:14.120
Just play the damn game.

729
00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:16.800
Linda, Linda, Linda!

730
00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:21.160
There he is. Yeah.

731
00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:24.160
That's me, baby.
That's me. I did that.

732
00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:26.640
I drew that up. Yeah.

733
00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:29.080
Run it again.

734
00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:33.200
All right, 1-4, 1-4.
Linda, Linda, Linda!

735
00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:40.600
All day, baby. All day!
Can't stop that.

736
00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:42.600
Can't stop that!

737
00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:47.520
- Hey, coach, your shoe's untied, sir.
- Thank you, Mr. Worm.

738
00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:52.680
Look at that bow. Look at that.

739
00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:55.480
I tied that. I tied that shit.

740
00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:57.560
Can I get something on the bow?
Let me get some.

741
00:44:58.480 --> 00:44:59.880
Are you crazy?

742
00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:02.360
What is wrong with you?

743
00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:04.800
What's wrong with all of you?

744
00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:08.360
Since when is winning not enough?

745
00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:11.800
Playing hard not enough?

746
00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:15.520
No, you have to humiliate
your opponent.

747
00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:18.400
Taunt him after every score.

748
00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:21.200
You won four games last season.

749
00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:22.560
Four.

750
00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:25.840
What gives you the right
to taint the game that I love

751
00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:28.640
with trash talk and taunting?

752
00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:32.000
What gives you the right to wear
Richmond on your chests

753
00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:33.240
and act like punks?

754
00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:35.760
- Coach, they were jawing too.
- So?

755
00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:37.520
You can't show some class?

756
00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:40.040
Act like a champion?

757
00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:45.480
You owe me 500 push-ups apiece.

758
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.280
On the line. Now.

759
00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:51.360
- Damn.
- Oh, man, come on.

760
00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:09.720
Listen, shorty, I'm just gonna be real
with you, okay?

761
00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:12.000
You're my girl.

762
00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:15.440
I get out on that court
and everything is just getting crazy,

763
00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:18.280
all I gotta do is just think about you.

764
00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:19.600
Mr. Lyle.

765
00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:22.560
Why aren't you in...

766
00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:26.240
...geometry?
- I'm going there right now, sir.

767
00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:28.840
- Sir, this is Betty.
- Bella.

768
00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:30.800
Bella. Bella. This is Bella, sir.

769
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.520
Go to class.

770
00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:40.720
Don't forget that these projects
are due at the end of this week.

771
00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:44.040
- So if any of you need extra time...
- Excuse me, sir. Are you Mr. Gesek?

772
00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:46.240
- Yes.
- I...

773
00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:49.400
...don't see Junior Battle
in this class.

774
00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:52.360
Junior Battle is like a solar eclipse.

775
00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:56.400
We rarely see him, but when we do,
it's always special.

776
00:46:58.440 --> 00:46:59.800
Thank you.

777
00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:04.320
"Surprise arrival to the poll
is Richmond High at 19th. "

778
00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:07.120
- Top 20, baby.
- We're 19th, dog.

779
00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:09.480
"The Oilers have posted
a perfect 9-0 mark,

780
00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:11.600
winning on the road against
perennial powerhouses

781
00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:13.160
Xavier and Baxter Union. "

782
00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:18.600
Junior, you should read
the rest of this.

783
00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:20.520
They blowing you up
in this paper.

784
00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:23.960
- Come on, man, read it.
- Man, you know he can't read.

785
00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:26.760
- Man, shut up.
- Shut up, Maddux.

786
00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:33.120
"Richmond center has been big
as the Oilers are 'boyed. "'

787
00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:37.080
Buoyed. The word is "buoyed. "

788
00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:42.520
"Buoyed by Junior Battle's
19.8- Rebound-a-night numbers. "

789
00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:46.240
See, that's my big nigga
right there, son. Hey.

790
00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:48.800
If you was any bigger,
you'd be my bigger nigga.

791
00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:52.320
Sit down. Sit down!

792
00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:07.040
"Nigger" is a derogatory term
used to insult our ancestors.

793
00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:10.920
See, if a white man used it,
you'd be ready to fight.

794
00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:13.840
Your using it teaches him to use it.

795
00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:16.920
You're saying it's cool.
Well, it's not cool.

796
00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:19.280
And when you're around me,
I don't wanna hear that shit.

797
00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:21.920
- We clear?
- Yes, sir.

798
00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:23.520
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

799
00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:24.960
Yes, sir.

800
00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:28.240
Mr. Worm,

801
00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:30.800
what is it you want
out of this basketball season?

802
00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:34.480
To win that state championship, sir.

803
00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:39.520
Well, who won the state basketball
championship last season, Lyle?

804
00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:41.680
Hell if I know, sir.

805
00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:43.960
Does anybody know?

806
00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:48.360
Okay.

807
00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:51.320
What's your father do for a living,
Mr. Lyle?

808
00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:57.440
My father's in jail, sir.

809
00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:02.880
Well, I'm sorry to hear that, sir.

810
00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:05.480
But that doesn't have to be your life.

811
00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:08.160
My point's this:

812
00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:10.600
I have four seniors on this team,

813
00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:13.640
Junior, Lyle, Kenyon and Worm.

814
00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:17.440
All of whom I think can play
basketball at the college level.

815
00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:18.920
College.

816
00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:22.760
That's a viable option for all of you.

817
00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:26.920
But you have to perform in the
classroom to have that chance.

818
00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:29.520
You have to have a vision.

819
00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:34.440
Tell me, how do you
see yourselves?

820
00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:38.960
ESPN, baby.

821
00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:41.640
That reminds me, Mr. Battle.

822
00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:46.120
Mr. Gesek tells me he doesn't
see you in his classroom very often.

823
00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:49.000
Yeah, we cool, though, me and him.

824
00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:51.120
Mr. Gesek is a big basketball fan.

825
00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:54.680
Well, as of now, you're suspended.

826
00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:56.600
Oh, you can practice,
but you can't play

827
00:49:56.800 --> 00:50:00.240
until Mr. Gesek tells me
you're caught up in his class.

828
00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:02.760
And that's a shout out
to the rest of you.

829
00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:04.320
You signed a contract.

830
00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:06.120
You made a commitment.

831
00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:09.400
Now, I have your schedules and I'll be
getting reports from your teachers.

832
00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:13.640
If you don't perform in the
classroom, you will not play.

833
00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:16.120
What's up with that?

834
00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:18.240
Sit down, Mr. Battle.

835
00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:23.400
All right, that's 500 push-ups.

836
00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:28.760
Man, this is bullshit!
We won those games, not you.

837
00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:31.880
That's 1,000 push-ups
for Mr. Battle, Clyde.

838
00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:34.160
You wanna try for 2,000?

839
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:55.640
Young man, think about the choice
you're making if you walk out that door.

840
00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:05.800
To the baseline.

841
00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:12.800
All right. How about LaQuisha,
if it's a girl.

842
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:17.280
LaQuisha? Okay, yeah, the ghetto
called and they want they name back.

843
00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:19.520
Girl, LaQuisha? Be for real.

844
00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:21.920
You might as well call the baby
Food Stamp.

845
00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:23.640
You're stupid.

846
00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:28.160
All right, I was thinking
I could call her Harmony.

847
00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:31.200
- I like Harmony.
- Harmony, oh, that's good. I like that.

848
00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:34.520
- What did Kenyon say?
- Please, he want a boy.

849
00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:37.000
- Figures.
- Speaking of Michael Jordan...

850
00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:38.520
Yo, what's wrong with a girl?

851
00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:42.200
Yeah, dog, boys grow into men,
and men ain't worth the trouble.

852
00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:44.680
Don't you have someplace to go?
Something to do?

853
00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:48.360
Guess he wants me all to himself.

854
00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:49.560
See you later.

855
00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:51.360
Don't forget,
I need your notes for history.

856
00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:54.600
- All right, I got you.
- Yeah. See you later.

857
00:51:56.600 --> 00:51:58.560
I bought us tickets to the dance.

858
00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:01.680
Why you telling these
loudmouth girls about the baby?

859
00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:03.720
Now everybody's gonna know.

860
00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:05.440
People are gonna know, Kenyon.

861
00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:08.680
- It's not people's business, Kyra.
- Why you jumping down my throat?

862
00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:10.240
What's wrong with you?

863
00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:15.360
Look, me and coach been talking,
and he thinks I can play college ball.

864
00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:16.520
All right, so?

865
00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:19.800
So how am I gonna do that
and raise a baby?

866
00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:25.760
I don't know. I mean,
I'm not saying it won't be hard.

867
00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:28.280
Hard? It's already hard.

868
00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:29.960
The kid ain't even here yet
and I'm worried

869
00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:33.160
about how I'm gonna feed it,
how I'm gonna pay for this and that.

870
00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:34.760
Everything.

871
00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:37.040
- I'm not ready.
- So, what are you saying?

872
00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:40.200
You want out?
Is that what you're saying?

873
00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:41.800
Go ahead and say it.

874
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.720
Look, if I wanted to be out,
I would've been out by now, Kyra.

875
00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:46.560
That's not it at all. I love you.

876
00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:48.080
I wanna be with you.

877
00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:50.240
Yeah, as long as it's convenient.

878
00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:51.720
I'm thinking about
what's best for us.

879
00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:54.080
You're not trying to think about
what's best for both of us,

880
00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:55.800
you're thinking about
what's best for you.

881
00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:59.480
You don't want me to have this baby.
You wanna leave Richmond.

882
00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:02.400
You wanna go play college ball.
So guess what?

883
00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:06.320
We ain't got to be ready enough
for nothing, all right?

884
00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:09.320
I'm ready enough to do what
I gotta do all by my damn self.

885
00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:12.360
So you can take these
and go to the dance yourself.

886
00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:16.480
Progress reports?
You're the basketball coach.

887
00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:19.040
Look, ma'am, we talked about this.
I don't see what the problem is.

888
00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:20.720
Do you know what the API is,
Mr. Carter?

889
00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:22.200
No, I don't.

890
00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:24.000
The Academic Performance Index.

891
00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:27.080
They judge schools on a scale
of one to ten, ten being the best.

892
00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:29.640
Do you have any idea
where Richmond falls on that scale?

893
00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:31.040
No, ma'am, I have no idea.

894
00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:33.840
We're a one, Mr. Carter, and have
been for the last seven years.

895
00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:35.920
The state rewards schools
for their performance.

896
00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:38.400
So every year I have less money
to pay faculty and staff.

897
00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:41.400
- Look, ma'am...
- Can I ask what it is you want?

898
00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:43.520
- I want my boys to go to college.
- College?

899
00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:46.280
Mr. Carter, Richmond graduates
50 percent of its students,

900
00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:47.720
the higher percentage being girls.

901
00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:50.640
Now, in my very educated opinion,
you have 15 players on your team,

902
00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:52.520
you'll be lucky to graduate
five of them.

903
00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:54.440
I'm sorry, ma'am,
but I don't agree with you.

904
00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:57.320
Look, these boys signed contracts.
Maybe if you'd read one of them...

905
00:53:57.520 --> 00:53:59.880
Your job is to win basketball games,
Mr. Carter.

906
00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:04.520
- I suggest you start doing your job.
- And your job is to educate these kids.

907
00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:08.160
I suggest you start doing yours.

908
00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:22.280
Well...

909
00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:24.720
...we had another good week.

910
00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:28.120
Yeah, business is very good, Kenny.

911
00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:31.080
But I'm on my own.
You're never here.

912
00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:33.840
- It gets crazy.
- Look, I appreciate everything you do.

913
00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:36.040
And I promise you... We're closed.

914
00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:38.720
- As soon as the season is over,
I will be here for you.

915
00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:40.280
Mr. Carter?

916
00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:42.000
- I'm...
- Junior Battle's mother.

917
00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:43.680
Yes, ma'am, I remember you.

918
00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:46.440
Willa. Willa Battle.

919
00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:48.920
How may I help you, ma'am?

920
00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:50.440
Mr. Carter, I got a phone call today

921
00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:53.240
from a coach at a junior college
in Sacramento.

922
00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:55.360
Now, they wanna see
Junior play this Friday.

923
00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:57.800
Well, that's great, ma'am,
but Junior broke some rules...

924
00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.480
And I agree with them.

925
00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:02.120
I'm not here to argue
with your rules.

926
00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:03.840
I'm not.

927
00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:08.920
Almost two years ago now,

928
00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:13.240
Junior's older brother, Anton, was...

929
00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:19.000
...killed, and it's been confusing
and hard for me and for Junior.

930
00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:22.240
After you lose a son...

931
00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:28.120
...every time the phone rings,
your heart stops.

932
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.440
Now, I'm not asking
for special attention.

933
00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:36.080
I agree he needs to get straight
with his classes.

934
00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:40.160
But the idea of junior college
had never even occurred to my son.

935
00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:44.040
Now, I could move to the Hercules
school district, and he could play there.

936
00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:48.800
- But moving is not gonna solve...
- But I want him to play for you.

937
00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:51.680
Look, I'm not gonna stand here

938
00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:55.240
and say I know how it feels
to lose a son, because I don't.

939
00:55:56.040 --> 00:56:00.120
And I do appreciate you
putting your trust in me.

940
00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:03.000
But I need to hear that from Junior.

941
00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:05.040
He in the car.

942
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:11.280
Junior!

943
00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:23.160
Go on.

944
00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:30.520
I'm sorry for what I said and did
at practice,

945
00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:33.680
and I promise to get caught up
with my classes, sir.

946
00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:40.880
Look me in the eye, sir.

947
00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:48.200
Everything inside me tells me
if I take you back,

948
00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:50.880
I'd be making a mistake
and you'll make a fool of me.

949
00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:52.880
No, sir.

950
00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:57.200
You owe me 1,000 push-ups

951
00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:59.960
and 1,000 suicides
before you can play.

952
00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:02.680
I'll see you at practice tomorrow.

953
00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:06.600
Thank you, sir.

954
00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:17.000
And you gonna do
every last one of them.

955
00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:19.160
Quitting basketball like you pay rent.

956
00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:20.680
I don't know who you think you are.

957
00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:24.120
The next time you make a decision,
you better ask me first.

958
00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:26.680
Yo, Junior,
you did your thing tonight, man.

959
00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:29.400
- Good looking out, yo.
- Yeah, good shot, Junior.

960
00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:32.080
- Yeah, no doubt.
- Gentlemen, listen up.

961
00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:36.560
I just received a call from the director
of the Bayhill Holiday Tournament.

962
00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:39.000
You have been invited.

963
00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:41.600
- Yeah!
- Yeah, baby!

964
00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:47.240
Now, I have more good news.

965
00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:49.440
I spoke to Principal Garrison today.

966
00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:53.320
She informs me that your teachers will
have your academic-progress reports

967
00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:55.360
prepared by the end
of holiday break.

968
00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:56.960
Sir, our grades are tight, yo.

969
00:57:57.320 --> 00:57:58.960
Yo, not only are our grades
all right, coach,

970
00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:01.720
- but we undefeated, homeboy.
- Yeah!

971
00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:05.960
<i>We undefeated
We undefeated</i>

972
00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:10.240
<i>We undefeated
We undefeated</i>

973
00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:14.080
<i>We undefeated
We undefeated</i>

974
00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:19.160
Big ups to everybody who came out to
the Richmond High winter dance, y'all!

975
00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:20.840
Get down!

976
00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:45.200
So give it up for the new
kings of Richmond, y'all!

977
00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:47.200
Yeah! Give it up, baby!

978
00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:49.240
Yo, we 12-0, y'all,
and I just wanna say

979
00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:52.000
I wanna see all the beautiful people
up at that tournament.

980
00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:53.640
You know!

981
00:58:53.840 --> 00:58:56.520
Y'all gonna wanna see the look on
the faces of them rich fancy-schoolers

982
00:58:56.680 --> 00:58:58.360
when the Richmond Oilers
roll into town.

983
00:58:58.560 --> 00:59:00.680
Holla!

984
01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:20.040
Kyra, what are you thinking?
You can't drink!

985
01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:21.960
- You're pregnant, girl.
- Stop.

986
01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:23.320
It's soda, all right?

987
01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:25.240
So why don't you just go
back downstairs

988
01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:27.240
and find one of your little girlies
to freak with.

989
01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:29.560
It ain't even like that.
Some girl just danced up on me.

990
01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:31.360
- That ain't shit.
- Whatever.

991
01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:33.360
You shouldn't be here.
If you're serious about this,

992
01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:35.280
you need to check this bullshit.
Because if not...

993
01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:38.600
If not, what, Kenyon? You wanna hold
my hand through an abortion?

994
01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:40.680
- Is that what you want?
- I don't know what I want.

995
01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:42.320
You so damn sure you wanna
have this baby,

996
01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:43.960
why don't you tell me how
it's gonna be.

997
01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:45.800
Everything's great, right?

998
01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:48.480
Your cousin is 19 with two kids
already, Kyra.

999
01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:50.000
It's great?

1000
01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:52.000
It was great when we
was getting down.

1001
01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:53.800
You ain't having no second
thoughts about that.

1002
01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.200
You loved me
when it came to that.

1003
01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:00.160
Look, Kyra, I can't tell you
what to do,

1004
01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:03.240
but I look around and I see exactly
how I don't wanna live.

1005
01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:04.680
Paycheck to paycheck?

1006
01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:06.320
Dead-end job?

1007
01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:08.760
You make it seem like everything's
gonna be all good,

1008
01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:11.120
like everything's so wonderful.

1009
01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:14.280
You don't care about me.

1010
01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:18.440
You just wanna go to college,
play ball and forget about me.

1011
01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:21.080
- Kyra, that's not even how it is.
- I don't care what you say.

1012
01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:24.040
- I'm having this baby.
- And then what?

1013
01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:25.640
You got everything figured out, right?

1014
01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:28.640
So tell me what comes next.

1015
01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:56.800
<i>The third and final day of
the 22nd Bayhill Tournament</i>

1016
01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.960
<i>finds the host team, Bayhill,</i>

1017
01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:03.160
<i>trying to win the championship against
the surprising Richmond Oilers.</i>

1018
01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:04.680
<i>Defense! Defense!</i>

1019
01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:06.240
Get your hands up!

1020
01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:13.160
Get that ball!

1021
01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:26.400
<i>Richmond uses their last timeout with
1:20 remaining in the fourth quarter</i>

1022
01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:28.840
<i>- and Bayhill up by six.
- Time out!</i>

1023
01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:34.040
Come on, man.
We still in the game. Come on.

1024
01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:45.800
Don't panic.

1025
01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:48.400
We're six down with 1:20 left, right?

1026
01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:50.360
We've been in these guys' ass
the whole game.

1027
01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:51.720
We can do this.

1028
01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:54.200
- This is our time, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

1029
01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:57.320
All right, set up the 1-4.
Run Candy.

1030
01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:59.040
Damien's gonna hit the three.

1031
01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:01.760
Kenyon, Lyle,
set a hard screen down here.

1032
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.480
When he hits the three,
go right into Diane.

1033
01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:05.880
Pressure the inbound pass.

1034
01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:07.640
Suffocate that pass.

1035
01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:09.400
I want the ball back!

1036
01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:11.360
- Come on, baby, lock up.
- Hands in.

1037
01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:13.480
- Let's go.
- "Our time" on three!

1038
01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:15.680
- One, two, three!
- Our time!

1039
01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:17.160
Come on, let's go.

1040
01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:26.440
One, two, three, Cougars!

1041
01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:28.200
Let's go, guys!

1042
01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:36.680
1-4! 1-4! Candy!

1043
01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:40.320
- Hands up! Hands up!
- Ball, ball, ball, ball!

1044
01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:42.560
Watch him!

1045
01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:47.720
- Watch your back! Come in!
- Watch the screen!

1046
01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:49.840
Make the shot, Damien!

1047
01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:55.560
Diane! Diane!

1048
01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:57.000
<i>Defense!</i>

1049
01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:02.080
Go, go, go. Ball, ball, ball.

1050
01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:04.920
Right there, right there. I got him.

1051
01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:08.680
- Off him, man. Off him.
- Richmond's ball!

1052
01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:10.560
Richmond's ball!

1053
01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:11.960
Yeah!

1054
01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:18.520
Kenyon! Kenyon!
Hattie Jean! Hattie Jean!

1055
01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:20.840
Hattie Jean, Hattie Jean,
Hattie Jean!

1056
01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:23.040
- D up!
- Check! Check!

1057
01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:28.160
- Get there!
- Right there!

1058
01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:35.480
Get back! Get back! Get back!

1059
01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:38.720
Move your feet!
Move your feet!

1060
01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:50.200
A foul, ref!

1061
01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:56.360
Right wing, Kenyon, wing!

1062
01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:05.120
<i>Richmond takes the lead
for the first time in the game,</i>

1063
01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:07.960
<i>78 to 76.</i>

1064
01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:16.520
Slow the ball down!
Slow the ball down!

1065
01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:20.720
<i>Let's go, Cougars, let's go!</i>

1066
01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:25.760
<i>Defense! Defense!</i>

1067
01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:35.560
- That's a charge! Driving!
- Basket's good!

1068
01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:40.480
<i>The basket counts,
and the Cougars have tied the game.</i>

1069
01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:44.160
That was a bad call, ref!

1070
01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:50.360
- Basket counts! One shot!
- That's a charge!

1071
01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:53.640
- Foul's on red five. On the block.
- Don't tie me like that!

1072
01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:56.480
Coach! Please get back in the box.

1073
01:05:56.680 --> 01:05:58.680
Please get in the box?
Please get your head in the game!

1074
01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:00.040
Give me a break!

1075
01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:02.400
Cruz. In for Lyle.

1076
01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:05.640
- Kenyon! Damien!
- Sub, for five.

1077
01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:07.600
Let's go.

1078
01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:11.080
Listen, we got nine seconds left.
Get the ball, push it hard.

1079
01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:13.680
The ball's coming to you, Kenyon.
Run Linda. Run Linda.

1080
01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:15.680
You be open, all right?
Let's go. You can do this.

1081
01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:17.920
Do it. Let's go.
Come on, sirs. Hurry.

1082
01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:20.080
Let's go, guys! Let's go!

1083
01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:23.800
Let's go! Let's go!

1084
01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:26.440
One shot.

1085
01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:29.000
Backboard D!
Backboard D!

1086
01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:44.480
<i>And the Bayhill Cougars take the lead
with nine seconds left.</i>

1087
01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:47.920
<i>Go to war, Miss Margaret,
this is a tight one.</i>

1088
01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:49.760
Let's go, let's go!

1089
01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.160
Linda! Linda!

1090
01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:54.560
Watch the pick! Watch the pick!

1091
01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:02.040
Stop the ball! Stop the ball!

1092
01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:06.320
It's not there! It's not there!
To the hole! To the hole!

1093
01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:09.240
Watch it!

1094
01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:12.680
D up, man!

1095
01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:19.320
Yeah!

1096
01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:40.480
It's all right, man.

1097
01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:46.280
- Nice game. Nice game.
- Good game, coach. Thank you, sir.

1098
01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:51.280
<i>Rich what? Richmond!</i>

1099
01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:54.120
<i>Rich what? Richmond!</i>

1100
01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:56.520
<i>Rich what? Richmond!</i>

1101
01:07:57.960 --> 01:07:59.560
Line up! Line up!
Let's shake hands.

1102
01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:01.760
That's what I'm talking
about, coach.

1103
01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:04.960
- Way to go, Lyle. Good game, son.
- Love you, Dad.

1104
01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:06.560
Ladies and gentlemen,
I now present

1105
01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:10.120
the 22nd Annual Bayhill Tournament
championship trophy

1106
01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:12.360
to Richmond High School.

1107
01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:34.240
Hey, number three.

1108
01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:42.080
- Nice game.
- Thank you.

1109
01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:48.400
Okay, cool.

1110
01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:02.360
- All right, come on.
- All right.

1111
01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:04.320
Watch his door.

1112
01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.480
Yo, yo. Come on, man, let's go.

1113
01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:30.320
Load up, load up.

1114
01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:48.320
Tonya, guess what.

1115
01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:50.560
We won the whole thing.

1116
01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:53.920
That's right, 16-0.

1117
01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:55.720
Oh, and here's the best part:

1118
01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:58.200
Your second-favorite man was MVP.

1119
01:09:58.400 --> 01:09:59.560
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1120
01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:01.440
I shouldn't tell you that.
He should tell you.

1121
01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:04.320
I'll wake him up so he can tell you.
Hold on.

1122
01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:08.160
Why don't you try their doorbell
with your ghetto self. Move.

1123
01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:10.040
Can you reach that?

1124
01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:19.000
- Look at this place.
- Glad you guys could come.

1125
01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:21.600
Oh, you know, we try to be
up in here, baby.

1126
01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.440
Yo, what's up? This is a nice crib.

1127
01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:40.680
Know what? He must be
in somebody else's room.

1128
01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:55.520
Like I was saying, you know,
I'm Junior Battle. I'm the man.

1129
01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:58.400
- That's what I'm talking about.
- I know.

1130
01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:01.440
- So you ain't got no boyfriend?
- Maybe.

1131
01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:15.240
Yo!

1132
01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:17.680
You looking for your team?

1133
01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:19.520
Yes, sir.

1134
01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:23.680
Oh, baby. Hard biz.
Know what I'm saying?

1135
01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:27.080
This is my style right here.
I'm amazing. Feel me, Lyle?

1136
01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:28.960
Hey, yo, Lyle.
Let me get a coochie juice.

1137
01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:31.400
I got you, dog. I got you.

1138
01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:33.120
- Yo, Worm!
- What up, dog?

1139
01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:34.880
- Damien!
- Yeah?

1140
01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:36.520
I'm open!

1141
01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:38.520
Damien!

1142
01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:45.400
- Damien, are you drunk?
- No. I don't drink.

1143
01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:47.400
- Sorry about the thing.
- It's okay.

1144
01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:49.960
- I see you!
- I see you too.

1145
01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:53.600
- I see her!
- Why don't we go swimming.

1146
01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:55.600
- We're going swimming?
- Yeah.

1147
01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:57.280
Hey, I'm going swimming!

1148
01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:00.320
I'm going swimming!

1149
01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:03.840
You're going swimming
with the MVP!

1150
01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:06.160
MVP!

1151
01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:20.840
This water's probably
cold as hell, shorty. I don't know.

1152
01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:23.280
And swimming ain't my cup of tea,
baby. Know what I'm saying?

1153
01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:26.280
Heated. Probably 90 degrees.

1154
01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:29.000
- We don't have bathing suits.
- Right.

1155
01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:31.120
Neither do we.

1156
01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:35.120
Oh, so it's like that?

1157
01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:36.960
Show me the money, then,
know what I'm saying?

1158
01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:39.760
- Damn!
- Since it's like that.

1159
01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:48.960
Oh, damn. Yeah, that's nice.

1160
01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:53.160
- Damn!
- You are looking right.

1161
01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:55.240
I like that.

1162
01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:57.080
You guys coming?

1163
01:12:57.280 --> 01:12:59.480
We're getting in there.

1164
01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.920
I gotta take my chain off
so it don't turn green.

1165
01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:06.680
Oh, man, I can't believe this.

1166
01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.280
Heaven!

1167
01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:31.080
Excuse me.

1168
01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:35.520
- Can I help you?
- I'm Ken Carter,

1169
01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:37.440
coach of the Richmond High
basketball team.

1170
01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:39.320
Richmond?

1171
01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.480
- You're a little lost, aren't you?
- Well, I'm looking for my son.

1172
01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:46.240
The cab driver told me he dropped
the team off here for a party.

1173
01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:47.920
Excuse me.

1174
01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:29.920
Oh, my God, is that...?

1175
01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:31.640
Oh, my God, it's Susan's dad.

1176
01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:33.760
You see your son?

1177
01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:36.160
Yes, sir, I do.

1178
01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:43.360
Damien Carter.

1179
01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:46.320
Get your ass out of that pool.

1180
01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.400
Yes, sir.

1181
01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:51.040
Richmond High players, let's go!

1182
01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:54.320
- Coach!
- Hey, Worm, where did you go?

1183
01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:56.000
Worm?

1184
01:14:57.320 --> 01:14:58.880
What up, coach?

1185
01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:01.000
I got somebody I want
you to meet.

1186
01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:04.760
Now, I just met her,
but she is fine as hell.

1187
01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:07.640
- Her name is...
- Susan!

1188
01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:09.960
- Susan. He right!
- Oh, shit.

1189
01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:12.840
My daughter, Susan.

1190
01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:17.600
You are not going to like
what happens in practice on Monday.

1191
01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:19.920
You think you've run for me before?

1192
01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:24.480
I come to your rooms to celebrate
with you, and you sneak...

1193
01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:30.280
I end up taking a road trip
to the suburbs,

1194
01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:32.960
where I find my
drunk-ass point guard

1195
01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:35.360
on top of Daddy's little princess!

1196
01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:39.240
Actually, I was on the bottom, coach.
She was on the top.

1197
01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:41.800
Worm, do you wanna be
on this team?

1198
01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.520
Because you're about six words
from getting kicked off

1199
01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:47.520
and kicked off the goddamn bus!

1200
01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:49.880
Cruz, open your eyes!

1201
01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:52.160
Ghetto hoop stars!

1202
01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:55.960
Signing autographs
and humping the honeys!

1203
01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:59.120
Well, I'm gonna show you
what humping is.

1204
01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:03.080
Coach, we won the tournament.

1205
01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:04.560
We undefeated.

1206
01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:06.760
I mean, ain't that what you wanted?

1207
01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:08.240
Winners?

1208
01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:20.960
Oh, no.

1209
01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:24.040
Oh, no, no, no.

1210
01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:26.680
Oh, no!

1211
01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:32.320
God...!

1212
01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:45.320
You guys are awesome!

1213
01:17:58.120 --> 01:17:59.640
What's up, Cruz?

1214
01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:00.960
I don't know.

1215
01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:03.680
Coach giving us a day off, I guess.

1216
01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:08.240
Yo, I don't even know where
the library's even at.

1217
01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:10.440
- I bet you don't.
- "Library's at"?

1218
01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:12.800
He don't know
where the library's at.

1219
01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:28.720
Quiet.

1220
01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:31.680
Quiet!

1221
01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:36.040
Gentlemen, in this hand,
I hold contracts

1222
01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:38.560
signed by me and signed by you.

1223
01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:43.200
In this hand, I hold academic-progress
reports prepared by your teachers.

1224
01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:46.280
We have six players failing
at least one class,

1225
01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:50.400
eight players getting incompletes
based on attendance.

1226
01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:53.680
Gentlemen, you have failed to up...

1227
01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:55.840
No, I'm sorry.

1228
01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:58.400
We have failed.

1229
01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:00.600
We have failed each other.

1230
01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:03.560
Now, there are some of you
who have upheld this contract.

1231
01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:07.040
But know that we are a team.

1232
01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:10.000
And until we all meet the terms
of this contract,

1233
01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:11.840
the gym will remain locked.

1234
01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:13.200
- Locked?
- What?

1235
01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:15.520
- What you mean, locked?
- What, like for the day?

1236
01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:17.520
- He must mean for the day.
- Mr. Thompson,

1237
01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:20.800
Mr. Gesek and Miss Sherman have
generously volunteered their time

1238
01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.440
to help us reach our goals.

1239
01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:24.200
But, coach, I have a 3.3.

1240
01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:25.720
That's good, sir.

1241
01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:27.880
Do you score all the points
for the team too?

1242
01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.640
We are the Richmond Oilers.

1243
01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:37.000
Do you know what Oilers
stands for?

1244
01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:42.080
Sir?

1245
01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:45.520
Know that you're not just
walking out on me.

1246
01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:47.680
You're walking out on them.

1247
01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:50.280
I had to beg you.

1248
01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.480
And then I ran all those sprints.

1249
01:19:55.240 --> 01:19:56.640
I did all that shit.

1250
01:19:56.840 --> 01:20:00.800
I killed myself for you, sir,
to get back on the team.

1251
01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:05.840
This is bullshit.

1252
01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:30.680
You put a lock on the gym and forced
them to meet you in the library?

1253
01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:32.320
- Are you crazy?
- Miss Garrison.

1254
01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:34.560
I'm surprised you know
where my office is.

1255
01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:36.240
Take the lock off that gym.

1256
01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:37.840
My phone hasn't stopped ringing.

1257
01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:39.560
Maybe someone on the other end
of that phone

1258
01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:41.400
has a solution to our problem.

1259
01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:44.560
Your intentions are good, Mr. Carter,
but your methods are a bit extreme.

1260
01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:46.600
You painted an extreme picture.

1261
01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:49.520
No one expects them to graduate,
no one expects them to go to college.

1262
01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:52.360
So you take away basketball,
the one area of their lives

1263
01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:54.400
- where they have some success?
- Yes, ma'am.

1264
01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:56.160
And you challenge them
academically?

1265
01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:58.000
- Yes, ma'am.
- And what if they fail?

1266
01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:00.200
Then we've failed.

1267
01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:03.880
Unfortunately, Mr. Carter,
both you and I know

1268
01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:06.240
that for some of these kids,
this basketball season

1269
01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:08.920
will be the highlight of their lives.

1270
01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:13.280
Well, I think that's the problem.
Don't you?

1271
01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:39.520
- Good morning, Coach Carter.
- Good morning.

1272
01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:41.400
Quite the Pandora's box
you've opened.

1273
01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:42.960
Oh, I get all the blame now?

1274
01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:45.920
Let's just say I'm happy to give you
all the credit.

1275
01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:49.200
I've got every news reporter in town
waiting to speak to you.

1276
01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:52.000
Got a press conference set up
around the front of the gymnasium.

1277
01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:54.360
Coach Carter has taken the lockout
to the next level

1278
01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:56.200
by canceling last night's game.

1279
01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:59.840
Richmond forfeited the game,
making it their first loss of the season.

1280
01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:01.760
And for now,
the lock remains on the gym.

1281
01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:03.640
Here he comes.
Here he comes now.

1282
01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:07.840
Coach Carter! Coach!
Can I get a question?

1283
01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:11.320
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
I'd like to thank you for your patience.

1284
01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:14.160
At this time, I'd like to introduce
Coach Ken Carter.

1285
01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:16.520
You may direct
your questions to him.

1286
01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:21.120
Mr. Carter, is it unfair to the players
whose grades qualify them to play?

1287
01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:22.960
Basketball's a team sport, sir.

1288
01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:25.400
We support each other
on and off the court.

1289
01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:27.840
Anybody still think coach
bluffing now?

1290
01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:30.560
I feel like running right up
in the middle of all those reporters

1291
01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:33.120
and telling them I think this
is bullshit, son.

1292
01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:35.560
Maybe you should've gone
to class, Lyle.

1293
01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:38.400
Maybe you should kiss my ass, dog.
My grades are fine, homeboy.

1294
01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:41.480
- It's Junior they should've locked out.
- Maybe Junior will kick your ass out.

1295
01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:44.840
- Why don't you try spelling it, then.
- Chill, chill, chill, man. Damn.

1296
01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:47.680
- Junior, if you need help, I'll tutor you.
- Man, I don't need no help.

1297
01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:49.440
Well, he ain't lock us out
for no reason.

1298
01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:52.960
We been tripping lately, man.
All y'all know it.

1299
01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:55.400
How do you think the community's
gonna react to this lockout?

1300
01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:58.560
I'm not really sure. I hope
they'll support these young men.

1301
01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:00.680
What, man?

1302
01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:03.040
No, man, it's just funny, dog,
because, Junior, man,

1303
01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:06.280
you thought it was bad all us knew
your dumb ass was failing science.

1304
01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:08.880
Now the whole world about to know
your dumb ass failing science.

1305
01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:11.680
- Man.
- Hey, man.

1306
01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:16.360
And you have Fremont this Saturday,
the biggest game on your schedule.

1307
01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:20.240
Now, Richmond is gonna riot
if you forfeit that game.

1308
01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:21.920
Saturday is a long way off.

1309
01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:24.000
We'll see what happens.
Thank you all for coming.

1310
01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:26.600
That's all the time I have right now.
I have to get back to work.

1311
01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:29.600
Coach, have you talked to any
of the parents?

1312
01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:32.160
Thank you for your time,
ladies and gentlemen.

1313
01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:34.880
I'd like to remind you that classes
are in session,

1314
01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:37.360
so as you leave campus,
please do so quietly.

1315
01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:40.080
I ain't turning the cheek.

1316
01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:42.600
He come up in my 'hood,
I'm serious, it's on.

1317
01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:44.920
- Young sirs.
- It's always been like that.

1318
01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:47.000
It's been a long day.

1319
01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:50.080
Reporters. Media everywhere.

1320
01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:54.200
Let's take this time to say whatever it is
we want while the doors are closed.

1321
01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:57.840
You have the floor.
This is about us.

1322
01:23:58.040 --> 01:24:01.240
Man, this shit ain't about us.
This is all about Coach Carter.

1323
01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:03.080
We're the basketball team.

1324
01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:06.600
All I see is you on TV,
getting famous, eating that shit up.

1325
01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:09.000
- Is that all you see?
- It's all I see.

1326
01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:10.880
You ain't lying.

1327
01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:12.960
Well, let me tell you what I see.

1328
01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:18.400
I see a system that's designed
for you to fail.

1329
01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:21.280
Now, I know you all like stats,
so let me give you some.

1330
01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:25.200
Richmond High only graduates
50 percent of its students.

1331
01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:30.360
And of those that do graduate,
only 6 percent go to college.

1332
01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:35.320
Which tells me, when I walk down
the halls and I look in your classrooms,

1333
01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:39.600
maybe only one student
is going to go to college.

1334
01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:43.520
"Well, damn, Coach Carter, if I ain't
going to college, where I'm gonna go?"

1335
01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:45.760
Now, that's a great question.

1336
01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:51.200
And the answer for young
African-American men in here is this:

1337
01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:53.200
Probably to prison.

1338
01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:57.360
In this county,
33 percent of black males

1339
01:24:57.560 --> 01:25:01.800
between 18 and 24 get arrested.

1340
01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:04.640
So look at the guy on your left.

1341
01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:07.800
Now look at the guy on your right.

1342
01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.200
One of you is going
to get arrested.

1343
01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:13.440
Growing up here in Richmond,

1344
01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:18.080
you're 80 percent more likely
to go to prison than college.

1345
01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:21.120
Those are the numbers.

1346
01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:24.040
Those are some stats for your ass.

1347
01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:27.040
Now, I want you to go home...

1348
01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:29.560
...and look at your lives tonight...

1349
01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:32.480
...and look at your parents' lives...

1350
01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.880
...and ask yourself, "Do I want better?"

1351
01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:38.640
If the answer is yes,

1352
01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:40.960
I'll see you here tomorrow.

1353
01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:43.520
And I promise you...

1354
01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:47.640
...I will do everything in my power

1355
01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:49.480
to get you to college

1356
01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:51.840
and to a better life.

1357
01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:20.960
I don't understand this.
It's a letter, how can it be a number?

1358
01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:22.760
How are balancing
those equations coming?

1359
01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:25.800
- I can't do this.
- Hold on. Come on, son.

1360
01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:27.120
Don't give up yet, son.

1361
01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:30.000
<i>Here's a story out of California
that's getting national attention.</i>

1362
01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:32.920
<i>The entire boys' basketball team
at Richmond High School</i>

1363
01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:34.400
<i>has been benched.</i>

1364
01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:37.000
<i>The highly ranked Oilers have
a perfect season on the court,</i>

1365
01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:39.520
<i>but some players were
in big trouble academically.</i>

1366
01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:43.440
<i>And in an unprecedented move,
Coach Ken Carter canceled practice,</i>

1367
01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:46.920
<i>locked the gym and sent his players
straight to the library.</i>

1368
01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:48.240
<i>Now, at the start of the season,</i>

1369
01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:50.920
<i>I understand you made all of
your players sign a contract</i>

1370
01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:52.400
<i>before they could join the team.</i>

1371
01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:54.560
<i>What exactly were the conditions
of that contract?</i>

1372
01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:57.160
<i>The contract states that
the players must maintain</i>

1373
01:26:57.360 --> 01:26:58.880
<i>a 2.3 grade point average</i>

1374
01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:01.360
<i>and that the players must
attend all their classes</i>

1375
01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:03.800
<i>and sit in the front row
of those classes.</i>

1376
01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.960
<i>Well, Coach Carter, it's an
unusual strategy, and a risky one</i>

1377
01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:08.960
<i>in a sense, in light of
your team's winning record,</i>

1378
01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:12.160
<i>but I think there's gonna be a lot of
people out there pleased to learn</i>

1379
01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:15.840
<i>that at least somebody still cares
about the concept of a student athlete.</i>

1380
01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:17.720
<i>Thanks a lot for joining us today.</i>

1381
01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:24.880
I'm sorry to disturb you.

1382
01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:27.880
I'm Coach Ken Carter of the Richmond
High School basketball team.

1383
01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:29.200
Oh, yeah.

1384
01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:30.960
I need to ask you a favor.

1385
01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:34.200
<i>My team is studying in the library,
and I've been trying to tell them</i>

1386
01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:36.280
<i>that brains and beauty
are a perfect combination.</i>

1387
01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:37.400
<i>Know what I'm saying?</i>

1388
01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:39.240
I mean, I'm Worm, baby.

1389
01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:41.280
How would you like
to watch the Worm work?

1390
01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:43.320
Hey, where did you get
that backpack?

1391
01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:44.560
Watch out, Too Short.

1392
01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:50.000
Why study earth science
or history or algebra?

1393
01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:55.360
Getting good grades in those subjects,
combined with basketball skills,

1394
01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:58.440
can get you into college.

1395
01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:01.440
Girl, you should've bought it.
I would've worn it.

1396
01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:13.360
You selfish son of a bitch.
You snake.

1397
01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:15.760
- Miss...
- No, no, don't "miss" me, snake.

1398
01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:17.360
Mr. Carter, you remember me?

1399
01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:20.240
Now, after all the things that my son
has been through for your team,

1400
01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:22.560
<i>for you to go lock up
this gym like this, how dare you...</i>

1401
01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:40.000
Open up the damn gym!

1402
01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:42.280
Let the boys play!

1403
01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:48.800
What's up, little cousin?

1404
01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.840
How you doing?

1405
01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:52.240
Got something for me?

1406
01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:55.560
That's what I'm talking about.

1407
01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:08.320
Hey, hey. Put it down, man.

1408
01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:11.680
- You Coach Carter, right?
- Yes, sir.

1409
01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:14.200
- Yeah? Check this out, man.
- Hey, hold on, man.

1410
01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:16.120
- Yeah. How you like that?
- Oh, hell no.

1411
01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:18.400
- What? What?
- You wanna get out the car?

1412
01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:20.760
- Let's talk about this.
- Ain't nothing to talk about.

1413
01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:22.880
Just open up the gym, man.
Let them boys play.

1414
01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:26.720
Trust me, you don't want me
out this car.

1415
01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:28.400
Yeah, see? Yeah.

1416
01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:30.400
- Get on!
- Don't be no punk.

1417
01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:31.520
Say what you gotta say.

1418
01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:33.680
- Come on back, punk.
- Dad. Relax. Relax, let it go.

1419
01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:35.040
No, I ain't letting nothing go.

1420
01:29:35.240 --> 01:29:38.640
These people in Richmond...
Goddamn it!

1421
01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:39.880
- Relax, Dad.
- Damn it!

1422
01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:42.880
Relax, relax. Chill out.
It's over. It's over. All right?

1423
01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:45.200
He doesn't mean anything. It's over.

1424
01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:46.560
Let it go.

1425
01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:49.000
Come on, get back in the car.
Let's go.

1426
01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:06.400
I think you know who she is,
but she's got a friend.

1427
01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:08.240
I mean, dog...
You gotta hook me up.

1428
01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:11.040
<i>Why I always gotta hook him up?
Sound like I'm the Love Connection.</i>

1429
01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:13.040
Just start a conversation.
I'll take care of it.

1430
01:31:13.240 --> 01:31:14.880
- Yeah.
- Yes, girl.

1431
01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:17.040
You don't remember me, do you?
But, see...

1432
01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:19.080
I was just ready to duff Duke out.

1433
01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:21.640
- Some serious shit.
- You should have did it, man.

1434
01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:24.320
You talking all that shit, just do it.
Know what I'm saying?

1435
01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:26.280
- You let somebody do that to you.
- I let him?

1436
01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:27.800
- Yo, Oscar, man.
- What?

1437
01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.280
Don't go nowhere. I'll be right out.

1438
01:31:29.480 --> 01:31:31.280
- I gotta talk to you.
- I already told you...

1439
01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:34.440
- No. You guys is kind of passing...
- I know I'm fine.

1440
01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:37.120
But I'm not feeling myself,
I'm feeling you.

1441
01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:40.840
Hey, I'm gonna holler at my boys
across the street for a quick minute.

1442
01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:42.240
Come on, man. Hurry up, man.

1443
01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:43.840
- All right.
- You know who we are, then?

1444
01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:46.040
- Here they go.
- What do we have here?

1445
01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:48.360
- The Three Stooges from Richmond.
- Punk, punk, punk.

1446
01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:49.920
- Larry, Co and Dummy.
- Bitches.

1447
01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:51.800
Dummy and dumb and dumber.
I mean, what the hell

1448
01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:55.240
is the bitchman from Richmond
doing on our side of the turf?

1449
01:31:55.560 --> 01:31:57.840
You garbage.
I can't believe y'all won.

1450
01:31:58.040 --> 01:31:59.200
- Shut up, woman.
- Don't be...

1451
01:31:59.400 --> 01:32:01.480
I don't understand how y'all won.

1452
01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:05.120
- Y'all wack-star niggas.
- Y'all wacked.

1453
01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:06.640
Wacked.

1454
01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:08.680
Yo, shut your bitch ass up.

1455
01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:11.560
- I don't wanna hear you talking shit.
- Homey, you a benchwarmer!

1456
01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:15.040
Get the hell out my face, whitey!

1457
01:32:17.640 --> 01:32:19.640
Let's do it, homey.
Let's do it, homey.

1458
01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:21.440
- What you trying to do?
- He got a piece, man.

1459
01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:24.880
You feel me right now, huh?
You feel me right now?

1460
01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:27.720
- Y'all brought a gun.
- Pinole homey. Feel me?

1461
01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:30.120
Keep it up the block, homey.
I'm right here, homey.

1462
01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:32.400
I'm right here. Right here.

1463
01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:34.400
It's all good. Y'all brought a gun!

1464
01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:35.920
Pinole!

1465
01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:37.920
Bitch-ass...

1466
01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:40.000
Pinole, right?

1467
01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:43.520
- Are they serious?
- I'll knock his braids out.

1468
01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:46.600
Nice to see the fight in you, dog.

1469
01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:49.000
- Know what I'm saying?
- Appreciate the backup.

1470
01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:50.560
Word.

1471
01:32:51.840 --> 01:32:53.280
I'm gonna see y'all later, all right?

1472
01:32:53.480 --> 01:32:54.880
- All right, homey.
- Good looking.

1473
01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:56.400
No doubt.

1474
01:32:57.040 --> 01:32:58.560
- I'm gonna check y'all.
- You got this.

1475
01:33:00.680 --> 01:33:02.800
This is my paper, man.
I'm not playing with you.

1476
01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.840
Then why don't you stop
getting in my face.

1477
01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:10.160
Renny!

1478
01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:20.680
Renny!

1479
01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:29.400
I can't believe...
He was just standing there.

1480
01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:31.240
- Renny!
- Oh, shit.

1481
01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:33.800
- Come on. Help me. Call 911.
- Call 911, man.

1482
01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:35.600
Yo, I need a phone.
I need something...

1483
01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:38.440
I just need you
to stay with me, okay?

1484
01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:43.360
Hold his head up.

1485
01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:51.400
Somebody help me!

1486
01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:15.840
- Cruz?
- I wanna come back, coach.

1487
01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:18.880
- What's going on?
- I wanna come back on the team.

1488
01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:22.320
What the hell happened?

1489
01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:25.600
They shot him.

1490
01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:28.800
Renny. They shot Renny.

1491
01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:30.880
I mean, we was just there.

1492
01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:33.280
We was just there.
Everything was good.

1493
01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:35.520
- Come inside. Come on.
- Everything was good, coach.

1494
01:34:35.720 --> 01:34:38.440
I mean, you know...

1495
01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:39.920
Come inside, son.

1496
01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:42.600
- Come on.
- You don't understand.

1497
01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:46.000
I wanna come back on the team.
What do I gotta do to play?

1498
01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:48.040
Don't worry about that, son.
Just come inside.

1499
01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:56.200
Whatever you want me to do,

1500
01:34:56.560 --> 01:34:57.960
I'll do it, okay?

1501
01:34:58.160 --> 01:34:59.320
Okay. Okay.

1502
01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:01.920
Okay. I got you.

1503
01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:03.920
Come on. Come on,
you're back with us now.

1504
01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:06.080
I can't believe they shot him.

1505
01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:07.920
Just come inside now, all right?

1506
01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:09.560
- Come on.
- I just wanna be on the team.

1507
01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:10.680
Come on. Come on.

1508
01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:13.480
Whatever you want me to do,

1509
01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:16.080
I'll do it, okay?

1510
01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:21.880
The state only requires a 2.0 GPA

1511
01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:24.640
for participation
in extracurricular activities.

1512
01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:26.800
- Yes, ma'am.
- And according to your contract,

1513
01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.120
the players are agreeing
to maintain a 2.3?

1514
01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:31.200
That, among other things.
Yes, ma'am.

1515
01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:33.600
- Other things like?
- Attending all classes,

1516
01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:35.280
sitting in the front row
of those classes,

1517
01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:37.120
and wearing a tie on game day.

1518
01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:39.840
I see. Mr. Carter,

1519
01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:42.720
does the lockout include
practices and games?

1520
01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:44.920
And do you have
a set period of time?

1521
01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:46.880
There will be no basketball, ma'am.

1522
01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:51.920
Please. Quiet, please.

1523
01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:54.320
That includes practices and games,

1524
01:35:54.520 --> 01:35:56.680
until we as a team
reach the agreed-upon GPA.

1525
01:35:57.360 --> 01:35:58.920
Please, quiet.

1526
01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:01.480
Please, quiet.

1527
01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:03.360
Quiet.

1528
01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:05.200
Thank you, Mr. Carter.

1529
01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:09.240
In the interest of time, I'd like to open
this board meeting up for comments.

1530
01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:11.840
As a teacher, I was offended
when asked by a coach

1531
01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:13.960
to provide progress reports.

1532
01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:17.440
Nowhere in my contract does it say
that I have to do so.

1533
01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:19.160
It creates more work.

1534
01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:21.520
This lockout has brought
negative media attention

1535
01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:24.360
that questions our abilities
as educators.

1536
01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:28.280
End this madness. End this lockout.

1537
01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:32.160
I'm Jason Lyle's uncle.

1538
01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:33.480
That boy lives to play ball.

1539
01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:35.640
Comes to school every day now.

1540
01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:38.080
You take away basketball,

1541
01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:40.640
God knows what he'd be into.

1542
01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:44.800
Yesterday, he canceled
the Fremont game.

1543
01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.200
Now, that's the biggest game
of the year.

1544
01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:49.280
I have scouts coming
to watch my boy play.

1545
01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:52.480
- Me too.
- These boys are 16-0.

1546
01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:55.720
This whole school, this whole
community, is behind this team.

1547
01:36:59.240 --> 01:37:01.360
Everybody goes to every game.

1548
01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:03.880
Basketball is the only thing
that these boys have got.

1549
01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:07.080
Are we gonna let Carter come in here
and take that away from them?

1550
01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:09.760
- No!
- I don't think so.

1551
01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:11.120
Not gonna happen.

1552
01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:20.800
- I'd like to make a motion.
- Yes, Mr. Walters?

1553
01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:25.280
I move that we remove Mr. Carter
as head basketball coach.

1554
01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:31.360
Order, please. Order.

1555
01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:33.080
This board does not have
the authority

1556
01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:35.240
to terminate employment
of a staff position.

1557
01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:39.600
Then I move we end the lockout
and let the kids play.

1558
01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:42.320
I second the motion.

1559
01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:43.840
- Okay.
- If I may?

1560
01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:45.280
Yes, Mr. Carter.

1561
01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:47.440
You really need to consider
the message

1562
01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:49.200
that you're sending these boys.

1563
01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:53.480
It's the same message that we
as a culture send to our pro athletes,

1564
01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:56.160
which is that they are above the law.

1565
01:37:56.560 --> 01:37:59.800
Now, I'm trying to teach these boys
the discipline that will inform their lives

1566
01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:01.600
and give them choices.

1567
01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:06.040
If you endorse the fact
that 15-, 16- and 17-year-olds

1568
01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:09.600
don't have to honor the simple rules
of a basketball contract,

1569
01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:12.800
how long do you think it'll be before
they're out there breaking laws?

1570
01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:16.840
Now, I played basketball
at Richmond 30 years ago.

1571
01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:19.240
It was the same thing then.

1572
01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:21.720
Some of my teammates
ended up in prison.

1573
01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:24.080
Some of them ended up dead.

1574
01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:27.080
I took this job because
I wanted to effect change

1575
01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:28.680
in a special group of young men,

1576
01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:32.680
and this is the only way
I know how to do that.

1577
01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
If you vote to end the lockout,

1578
01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:39.120
you won't have to terminate me.
I'll quit.

1579
01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:40.680
Good.

1580
01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.240
Thank you, Mr. Carter.

1581
01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:52.840
The board now recognizes
five voting members.

1582
01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:56.720
In this instance, we will be accepting
the vote of Principal Garrison as well.

1583
01:38:57.200 --> 01:39:00.720
Now, I put to those members
the vote on whether or not

1584
01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:02.640
to end the lockout.

1585
01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:04.840
All those in favor
of ending the lockout

1586
01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:08.000
will raise their right hand
when called upon.

1587
01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:12.360
I will vote first
by not raising my hand.

1588
01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.520
Principal Garrison?

1589
01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:21.640
Valerie Walker.

1590
01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:24.520
Benson Chiu.

1591
01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:28.480
Parent rep, Mr. Cepeda.

1592
01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:32.520
And Ms. Nyugen.

1593
01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:34.920
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1594
01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:52.240
The lockout ends with a vote
of 4 to 2.

1595
01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:55.560
If there's no other business,
this board meeting is adjourned.

1596
01:39:56.240 --> 01:39:57.640
Thank you all for coming.

1597
01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:16.160
Mr. Carter.

1598
01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:18.760
Are you sure you wanna do this?

1599
01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:22.920
Look, I know we haven't always seen
eye to eye,

1600
01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:25.760
but you've done such a great job with
these boys, it seems wrong to just...

1601
01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:29.680
Look. No offense, ma'am,
but all the work I did with those boys

1602
01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:31.520
was negated when they ended
the lockout.

1603
01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:33.320
I don't think that's true, I...

1604
01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:35.360
The board sent the message
loud and clear.

1605
01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:37.240
Winning basketball games
is more important

1606
01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:39.840
than graduating from high school
and going to college.

1607
01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:43.640
I'm sorry, I just can't support
that message.

1608
01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:34.520
Sir, they can cut the chain off the
door, but they can't make us play.

1609
01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:40.480
We've decided we're gonna finish
what you started, sir.

1610
01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:43.080
Yeah, so leave us be, coach.

1611
01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:44.880
We got shit to do, sir.

1612
01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.360
Our deepest fear is not
that we are inadequate.

1613
01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:03.400
Our deepest fear is that
we are powerful beyond measure.

1614
01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:07.560
It is our light, not our darkness
that most frightens us.

1615
01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:09.760
Your playing small
does not serve the world.

1616
01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:11.520
There is nothing enlightened
about shrinking

1617
01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:14.320
so that other people
won't feel insecure around you.

1618
01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:18.160
We were all meant to shine,
as children do.

1619
01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:21.200
It's not just in some of us,
it's in everyone.

1620
01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:23.560
And as we let our own light shine,

1621
01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:26.440
we unconsciously give other people
permission to do the same.

1622
01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:29.800
As we are liberated
from our own fear,

1623
01:42:30.200 --> 01:42:32.720
our presence automatically
liberates others.

1624
01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:41.160
Sir, I just wanna say thank you.

1625
01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:45.160
You saved my life.

1626
01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:56.000
Thank you, sirs.

1627
01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:00.560
All of you.

1628
01:43:41.160 --> 01:43:44.480
Academic-progress reports,
young men.

1629
01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:47.360
These things are...

1630
01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:49.920
...unbelievable.

1631
01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:53.040
I know you've been trying.

1632
01:43:55.080 --> 01:43:58.400
I guess there's only one way
to say this.

1633
01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:01.920
Gentlemen, we've reached our goal.
Let's play ball.

1634
01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:09.400
<i>Rich what? Richmond!</i>

1635
01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:11.880
<i>Rich what? Richmond!</i>

1636
01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:14.000
<i>Rich what? Richmond!</i>

1637
01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:41.640
Hustle back. Get back, get back.

1638
01:44:43.240 --> 01:44:45.040
Set it, Worm. Set it.

1639
01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:47.400
Watch baseline.

1640
01:44:47.560 --> 01:44:49.760
- Take it.
- Take it, come on.

1641
01:44:52.280 --> 01:44:54.600
- Yes!
- Find a man. Find a man.

1642
01:44:57.880 --> 01:44:59.720
Swing it, swing it.

1643
01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:02.240
Go, go, go.

1644
01:45:04.680 --> 01:45:06.640
Go, go.

1645
01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:08.200
Come on!

1646
01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:19.040
Go Richmond!

1647
01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:21.320
Hold the ball, hold the ball!

1648
01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:27.400
<i>Nine, eight, seven, six,</i>

1649
01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:31.520
<i>five, four, three, two, one,</i>

1650
01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:32.960
<i>see you!</i>

1651
01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:42.320
- Great game, coach.
- Good game.

1652
01:45:46.120 --> 01:45:49.280
<i>Richmond returns from their lockout
and keeps their streak alive</i>

1653
01:45:49.480 --> 01:45:50.720
<i>at 17 games.</i>

1654
01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:55.040
<i>A team that won only four games
last year is now a Cinderella team</i>

1655
01:45:55.240 --> 01:45:57.320
<i>that has to be thinking
that there's a chance</i>

1656
01:45:57.520 --> 01:46:00.000
<i>of getting the phone call
to come to the dance.</i>

1657
01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:02.360
<i>Is Richmond headed
for the state tournament?</i>

1658
01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:16.880
So, what else y'all gonna do
at the park when you go?

1659
01:46:17.080 --> 01:46:19.000
- Seesaw.
- Seesaw?

1660
01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:20.720
- You're gonna seesaw?
- Yeah.

1661
01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:23.440
- Who's gonna push you?
- My mommy's gonna push me.

1662
01:46:23.640 --> 01:46:25.640
Yeah?

1663
01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:28.080
That's good.
I wish I could go with you.

1664
01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:31.080
- Come on, baby.
- But I'll see you later, okay?

1665
01:46:31.240 --> 01:46:33.280
- Bye.
- Bye.

1666
01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:39.840
How you been?

1667
01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:43.520
Good.

1668
01:46:44.120 --> 01:46:46.160
You look good.

1669
01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:49.200
Thank you. So do you.

1670
01:46:49.400 --> 01:46:51.360
Considering.

1671
01:46:55.640 --> 01:46:59.400
You know, everything's been crazy,
with the lockout.

1672
01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:01.000
Yeah, it'll be all right.

1673
01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:03.680
For sure.

1674
01:47:03.880 --> 01:47:05.680
Can we sit down somewhere?

1675
01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:28.360
I've been trying to get my head
straight about things.

1676
01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:31.040
A lot of things. Especially us.

1677
01:47:31.240 --> 01:47:33.800
- Kenny, I...
- Kyra, just listen.

1678
01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:36.640
Please.

1679
01:47:38.040 --> 01:47:43.000
For a long time, it's just been
my moms, my boys and you.

1680
01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:44.680
And that's what I counted on.

1681
01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:48.480
I'm trying to count on myself now,
and I'm all right and shit,

1682
01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:52.840
it's just, without you,
nothing good feels as good.

1683
01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:57.680
It's like I'm missing
some happy part of me.

1684
01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:10.360
I got you something.

1685
01:48:12.240 --> 01:48:13.920
And it ain't from the 99 Cent Store.

1686
01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:18.080
Shut up.

1687
01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:23.800
- They gave you a scholarship?
- Yeah, baby, a full ride.

1688
01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:28.480
Oh, my gosh. That is crazy.

1689
01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:30.800
Oh, my gosh.

1690
01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:32.680
I know you gonna kill it up there.

1691
01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:35.240
No, we gonna kill it up there.

1692
01:48:35.440 --> 01:48:37.760
I told them about you and the baby.
They wanna help us.

1693
01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:51.200
Kenyon...

1694
01:48:52.120 --> 01:48:54.080
...there is no more baby.

1695
01:48:57.760 --> 01:49:00.800
I decided not to go through with it.

1696
01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:03.840
Kyra.

1697
01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:07.040
I had a choice to make,

1698
01:49:07.240 --> 01:49:09.600
so I made it.

1699
01:49:09.800 --> 01:49:12.120
For me, Kenny.

1700
01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:17.720
Well, when?

1701
01:49:17.920 --> 01:49:21.280
Why didn't you tell me?
I would have gone with you.

1702
01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:27.520
I'm so sorry.

1703
01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:31.680
Kyra, I'm so sorry you had to
go through that by yourself.

1704
01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:36.640
My mom went with me.

1705
01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:39.880
But I think that...

1706
01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:45.560
I think you should go to school
and play ball and do your thing.

1707
01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:47.280
You know?

1708
01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:50.800
I want that for you. And that's real.

1709
01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:53.800
I think you should be all you can.

1710
01:49:55.960 --> 01:49:58.080
I want you to come with me.

1711
01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:02.560
Kyra, I love you.

1712
01:50:03.160 --> 01:50:04.800
I want you to come with me.

1713
01:50:05.960 --> 01:50:08.080
- You serious?
- I'm serious.

1714
01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:11.040
- Oh, my God.
- I love you.

1715
01:50:11.240 --> 01:50:13.360
I love you too.

1716
01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:22.200
Ken Carter.

1717
01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:26.400
I understand, sir.

1718
01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:29.120
All right. Thank you, sir.

1719
01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:39.000
We're in.

1720
01:50:40.680 --> 01:50:42.240
That's what I'm talking about.

1721
01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:51.360
Guys, guys, guys. Now, listen.

1722
01:50:51.560 --> 01:50:53.760
It's not gonna be easy.
It's gonna be a long road.

1723
01:50:54.440 --> 01:50:57.360
- We're a really low seed.
- Who did we get, coach?

1724
01:50:59.120 --> 01:51:00.640
St. Francis.

1725
01:51:00.840 --> 01:51:02.280
St. Francis?

1726
01:51:02.480 --> 01:51:05.520
Coach, they ranked number one
in the state.

1727
01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:09.640
Hey, yo, Junior, man, don't worry
about Ty Crane, dog. You'll get him.

1728
01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:13.320
We got this. That's all right, baby.
One game at a time. We got this.

1729
01:51:13.520 --> 01:51:15.360
- All right, guys.
- It's on.

1730
01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:27.040
- Bring your A game, young man.
- Yes, sir.

1731
01:51:57.160 --> 01:52:01.000
<i>Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,
to the first round of the CIF playoffs.</i>

1732
01:52:01.200 --> 01:52:04.520
<i>St. Francis is one of the best
high school teams in the nation,</i>

1733
01:52:04.680 --> 01:52:06.480
<i>with Ty Crane
believed to be a shoo-in</i>

1734
01:52:06.680 --> 01:52:09.280
<i>for the top NBA draft pick next year.</i>

1735
01:52:09.480 --> 01:52:11.840
<i>On the other side of the court
is Richmond,</i>

1736
01:52:12.040 --> 01:52:14.240
<i>a team that's had
a media-worthy season as well.</i>

1737
01:52:14.680 --> 01:52:17.480
<i>Richmond High has never played
in a state tournament.</i>

1738
01:52:17.640 --> 01:52:20.840
Let's go. Let's go, let's go.

1739
01:52:25.720 --> 01:52:27.680
- Settle down, settle down.
- 1-4!

1740
01:52:31.080 --> 01:52:32.480
Ball, ball.

1741
01:52:32.680 --> 01:52:34.240
Move, move.

1742
01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:40.320
Good shot, baby.

1743
01:52:41.720 --> 01:52:44.160
- Get back, get back.
- Run motion. Run motion.

1744
01:52:44.360 --> 01:52:45.920
Motion 44.

1745
01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:51.440
Right here, right here. Swing it.

1746
01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:55.760
Force him left. Force him left.

1747
01:53:01.320 --> 01:53:04.640
You gotta force him left.
The baseline's another defender.

1748
01:53:07.240 --> 01:53:08.880
D up!

1749
01:53:13.680 --> 01:53:15.560
Better get somebody else to hold me.
I'm dropping 50.

1750
01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:19.120
Set up!

1751
01:53:23.240 --> 01:53:25.800
Come on. Get on him, get on him.

1752
01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:28.920
Get over here and help.
He shouldn't be scoring.

1753
01:53:29.160 --> 01:53:30.720
Get back, get back. Bring it in.

1754
01:53:32.360 --> 01:53:34.520
Get back, get back.
Find your man, find your man.

1755
01:53:34.720 --> 01:53:36.640
Now, watch out. Watch that trap.

1756
01:53:36.840 --> 01:53:40.160
Watch the trap. Motion. Motion.
That's the one.

1757
01:53:41.800 --> 01:53:44.000
That's it. Yes! Yes!

1758
01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:47.600
<i>S- C-O-R-E! Score! Score!</i>

1759
01:53:50.160 --> 01:53:51.880
Ball, ball. Ball, man!

1760
01:53:58.440 --> 01:54:01.120
Lyle, stop the ball.
Less talk out there.

1761
01:54:10.920 --> 01:54:14.880
Come on, come on, come on.
Let's go, Richmond!

1762
01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:17.640
You gotta help Junior
on the weak-side pick.

1763
01:54:22.080 --> 01:54:26.120
<i>- Delilah! Delilah!
- Defense! Defense!</i>

1764
01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:28.480
<i>- Defense! Defense!
- Delilah! Delilah!</i>

1765
01:54:28.680 --> 01:54:30.080
Delilah! Delilah!

1766
01:54:31.680 --> 01:54:34.160
- Get there, get there.
- Trap, trap, trap. Left side, left side.

1767
01:54:46.200 --> 01:54:49.200
- Use the pick, use the pick.
- I got it.

1768
01:54:51.720 --> 01:54:54.800
- Yeah! That's what I'm talking about.
- Foul, number three.

1769
01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:56.000
- Hold up.
- Number three.

1770
01:54:56.200 --> 01:54:58.880
- Mustangs, bring it in. Bring it in.
- Count the basket.

1771
01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:01.280
- Damn.
- Timeout, sir. Time.

1772
01:55:01.480 --> 01:55:04.080
Come here, come here. Damn it.

1773
01:55:05.960 --> 01:55:08.200
Come on, guys,
keep up the defense!

1774
01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:10.800
Come on, what you gonna do?

1775
01:55:11.200 --> 01:55:13.760
We still in this game.
Come on, fellas.

1776
01:55:14.560 --> 01:55:17.760
Gentlemen, you told me
you deserved to be here.

1777
01:55:17.960 --> 01:55:19.440
Well, you're not playing like it.

1778
01:55:19.640 --> 01:55:22.400
All season long,
we played our game.

1779
01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:24.880
Right now, you're playing theirs.

1780
01:55:25.080 --> 01:55:28.840
When we step on the floor,
every second that clock is ticking,

1781
01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:30.960
we are pedal to the metal.

1782
01:55:31.160 --> 01:55:33.560
We run the ball.
We pressure the ball.

1783
01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:38.880
And most importantly,
we control the tempo of the game!

1784
01:55:39.080 --> 01:55:43.520
We make them play
Richmond Oiler ball.

1785
01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:45.600
Worm, you can take this kid.

1786
01:55:45.800 --> 01:55:47.280
Force him left,
and when he crosses over,

1787
01:55:47.480 --> 01:55:50.360
you jump him.
Damien, push the tempo.

1788
01:55:50.600 --> 01:55:52.800
Kenyon, Lyle, crash the boards.

1789
01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:56.400
Cruz, when you're in the game in
transition, take that jumper you love.

1790
01:55:56.840 --> 01:55:59.200
Junior, just keep doing
what you're doing.

1791
01:55:59.400 --> 01:56:01.160
Hold on to that monster.

1792
01:56:01.360 --> 01:56:04.600
You do those things, gentlemen,
and I guarantee you,

1793
01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:08.520
at the end of the game,
we will be there.

1794
01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:12.960
All right, hands in.

1795
01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:15.680
- Game time.
- All right, take control of this game.

1796
01:56:15.880 --> 01:56:17.000
Who's gonna win this game?

1797
01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:20.600
One, two, three, Richmond!
Let's go. Let's do this.

1798
01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:26.760
One, two, three, Mustangs!

1799
01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:36.480
- Get up, get up.
- Go, go, go.

1800
01:56:44.200 --> 01:56:45.280
Yes.

1801
01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:51.160
- Reach-in foul.
- That's the only damn one.

1802
01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:54.680
- How you gonna call that on me, ref?
- Good call, ref.

1803
01:56:54.920 --> 01:56:57.280
Cruz. In for Kenyon.

1804
01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:03.320
- Ball, ball, ball, ball.
- Run it, run it, run it.

1805
01:57:16.720 --> 01:57:18.800
Get back, get back!
Everybody get back.

1806
01:57:19.320 --> 01:57:20.960
Yeah! Come on!

1807
01:57:40.320 --> 01:57:41.960
Get back, get back, get back.

1808
01:57:51.040 --> 01:57:52.560
Ref, you gotta call that.
This is my house.

1809
01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:54.720
- Push, push.
- Can we get a call?

1810
01:58:02.920 --> 01:58:05.600
Take care of the ball, man.
I'm gonna catch my breath.

1811
01:58:14.440 --> 01:58:15.680
Come on. Get back, get back.

1812
01:58:20.480 --> 01:58:22.080
Swing it right here. I got it.

1813
01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:27.680
Charge.

1814
01:58:29.640 --> 01:58:31.840
- Go get them, boys.
- Yeah, baby.

1815
01:58:32.040 --> 01:58:34.840
Charge, number 30. Red ball.

1816
01:58:35.040 --> 01:58:37.160
Come on, ref,
you wasn't even there.

1817
01:58:42.440 --> 01:58:45.480
- Red ball, red ball. Red, red, red.
- Yes. Yes.

1818
01:58:45.680 --> 01:58:46.920
- Richmond's ball.
- What?

1819
01:58:47.120 --> 01:58:49.400
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

1820
01:58:56.600 --> 01:58:58.040
- Red ball.
- Junior, good block!

1821
01:58:58.880 --> 01:59:01.240
- I know that's a foul.
- It's all ball.

1822
01:59:01.440 --> 01:59:03.880
- What are you talking about?
- What's up, man?

1823
01:59:07.080 --> 01:59:08.960
Knock his bitch ass out.

1824
01:59:09.160 --> 01:59:11.000
Calm down, man.
We're still in the game.

1825
01:59:11.400 --> 01:59:12.480
Come on.

1826
01:59:13.200 --> 01:59:14.640
- Ease back.
- Bring it in. Bring it in.

1827
01:59:17.560 --> 01:59:19.600
Get out of my way, man. Get off me.

1828
01:59:20.960 --> 01:59:23.360
Let's go, let's go.

1829
01:59:23.560 --> 01:59:26.560
All right, baby, it's all us now.
It's all us. Let's go.

1830
01:59:35.400 --> 01:59:38.240
They're standing on the edge of a cliff.
All we gotta do is push them off.

1831
01:59:38.680 --> 01:59:39.680
We're gonna run Candy.

1832
01:59:39.880 --> 01:59:41.760
Worm, you gotta sell them
the pass to Damien.

1833
01:59:41.960 --> 01:59:44.640
Junior, we come to you
on the weak-side seal.

1834
01:59:44.840 --> 01:59:46.880
But, gentlemen,
just because you deserve this

1835
01:59:47.080 --> 01:59:48.640
doesn't mean they're gonna
give it to you.

1836
01:59:48.840 --> 01:59:52.520
Sometimes you gotta take
what's yours. You ready to do this?

1837
01:59:52.720 --> 01:59:54.240
- Hell, yeah.
- Let's go.

1838
01:59:54.440 --> 01:59:56.720
- All right, hands in.
- Come on, take this.

1839
01:59:56.920 --> 01:59:58.960
Richmond on three.
One, two, three, Richmond!

1840
02:00:06.080 --> 02:00:08.520
- Careful of the foul, all right? Let's go.
- I got you. 1-4, 1-4!

1841
02:00:09.600 --> 02:00:12.160
<i>- All right.
- Defense! Mustangs!</i>

1842
02:00:12.360 --> 02:00:14.080
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1843
02:00:16.840 --> 02:00:18.880
Candy! Candy!

1844
02:00:22.440 --> 02:00:24.360
Ball, Damien.

1845
02:00:28.880 --> 02:00:31.520
- Move, move.
- Help, help.

1846
02:00:47.240 --> 02:00:49.240
Get back, get back, get back!

1847
02:00:53.520 --> 02:00:54.880
Junior, get back!

1848
02:01:05.320 --> 02:01:07.120
Hands up!

1849
02:01:20.680 --> 02:01:23.280
Yeah, that's what I'm
talking about, baby. Yeah!

1850
02:02:13.160 --> 02:02:16.160
<i>Mustangs! Mustangs!</i>

1851
02:02:17.360 --> 02:02:20.680
Hold on, hold on. Let me down,
let me down. Battle, Battle! Battle!

1852
02:02:23.240 --> 02:02:26.120
You're real, man.
I mean that. All right?

1853
02:02:26.920 --> 02:02:29.760
All right? Keep your head up, baby.

1854
02:02:41.960 --> 02:02:44.600
Well, not quite
your storybook ending, huh?

1855
02:02:44.800 --> 02:02:47.120
Not for us, anyway.

1856
02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:52.320
But you men played like champions.

1857
02:02:52.520 --> 02:02:54.080
You never gave up.

1858
02:02:54.880 --> 02:02:58.800
And champions
hold their heads high.

1859
02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:02.280
What you achieved goes way beyond
the win-loss column

1860
02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:04.200
or what's gonna be written
on the front page

1861
02:03:04.400 --> 02:03:06.840
of the sports section tomorrow.

1862
02:03:07.040 --> 02:03:08.760
You've achieved something
that some people

1863
02:03:08.960 --> 02:03:12.400
spend their whole lives trying to find.

1864
02:03:12.600 --> 02:03:18.320
What you achieved
is that ever-elusive victory within.

1865
02:03:19.560 --> 02:03:21.240
And, gentlemen...

1866
02:03:22.080 --> 02:03:25.360
...I am so proud of you.

1867
02:03:28.520 --> 02:03:32.200
Four months ago, when I took
the job at Richmond, I had a plan.

1868
02:03:32.840 --> 02:03:35.240
That plan failed.

1869
02:03:35.400 --> 02:03:40.000
I came to coach basketball players,
and you became students.

1870
02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:43.680
I came to teach boys...

1871
02:03:44.200 --> 02:03:46.200
...and you became men.

1872
02:03:46.720 --> 02:03:48.440
And for that, I thank you.

1873
02:03:52.200 --> 02:03:55.040
If someone walked in this door
right now

1874
02:03:55.240 --> 02:04:00.600
and offered me the coaching job
at any school in the state of California,

1875
02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:03.440
you know which team I'd choose?

1876
02:04:03.640 --> 02:04:05.640
St. Francis?

1877
02:04:06.240 --> 02:04:08.360
I'm just saying, man.

1878
02:04:09.320 --> 02:04:11.280
Kenyon?

1879
02:04:14.920 --> 02:04:17.160
- Richmond?
- Rich what?

1880
02:04:18.280 --> 02:04:20.200
- Richmond.
- Rich what?

1881
02:04:20.360 --> 02:04:21.480
Richmond.

1882
02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:24.160
- Rich what?
- Richmond.

1883
02:04:24.360 --> 02:04:26.440
- Where we from?
- Richmond!

1884
02:04:26.640 --> 02:04:28.960
- What's my hometown?
- Richmond!

1885
02:04:29.160 --> 02:04:31.120
- What do we love?
- Richmond!

1886
02:04:31.320 --> 02:04:33.480
- Rich what?
- Richmond!
