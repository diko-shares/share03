00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:05.705
(soft calm music)

2
00:00:13.413 --> 00:00:15.314
(phone beeps)
Today is a very special day.

3
00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:17.182
Whoa, look at her go!

4
00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:19.151
Hey!
â™ª Hey hey hey hey

5
00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:21.286
Look at me, I graduated!

6
00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:22.389
That's my big sister.

7
00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:27.460
(soft calm music continues)

8
00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:30.062
(phone beeps)

9
00:00:30.063 --> 00:00:31.330
(chuckles) Okay, so,

10
00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:32.965
(clears throat) here's
what's happening.

11
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.534
Our dad is asleep right now.

12
00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:39.972
[Janet] Look at that.

13
00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:41.240
(George growls)
(Janet yelps)

14
00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:43.108
(Jake and George laughing)
Oh!

15
00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:44.144
Oh my gosh.

16
00:00:46.045 --> 00:00:47.713
Oh!

17
00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:52.552
(cars whooshing faintly)
(train chugging faintly)

18
00:00:54.187 --> 00:00:55.421
(phone beeps)
Hi!

19
00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:57.222
- [Jake] Happy birthday, Mom.
- Thanks!

20
00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:58.657
Aw.
Happy birthday, dear.

21
00:00:58.658 --> 00:01:01.093
You're still as beautiful
as the day I met you.

22
00:01:01.094 --> 00:01:02.428
- [Andrea] Aw.
- [Janet] Aww.

23
00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:04.163
Don't forget, you're
opening tomorrow.

24
00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:05.230
- [Andrea] Aw!
- That's great, Dad.

25
00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:06.331
Happy birthday, Mom.
Thanks!

26
00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:07.300
I love you so, so much.

27
00:01:07.301 --> 00:01:08.700
Thank you for all that you do.

28
00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:10.335
- Thank you for being here!
- Aww.

29
00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:12.104
[Jake] Thanks for
cleaning my dirty underwear.

30
00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:13.539
- You're welcome.
- That is so gross.

31
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:14.873
Can you, like, grow up?
For sure.

32
00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:15.974
[Janet] Anything else to say?

33
00:01:15.975 --> 00:01:17.309
Yeah, where's our food?

34
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.544
[Andrea] (laughs) I know,

35
00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:19.978
that's exactly what
I was thinking.

36
00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.213
[Janet] No, you're meant
to say something, like, nice.

37
00:01:21.214 --> 00:01:23.316
Okay, Mom, thanks
for birthing me.

38
00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:25.731
Gross.
[Andrea] You're welcome!

39
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.525
(Plane engine roaring)
(soft calm music continues)

40
00:01:36.563 --> 00:01:38.597
(ball thumps)
(hoop rattles)

41
00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:40.466
[George] Get some more
rotation on the ball

42
00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:41.800
when you're shooting.
More what?

43
00:01:41.801 --> 00:01:42.801
More rotation.

44
00:01:43.837 --> 00:01:46.840
(basketball thumping)

45
00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:50.844
Good.

46
00:01:50.845 --> 00:01:52.377
Better.

47
00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:54.713
You sure this thing's
not gonna break?

48
00:01:54.714 --> 00:01:56.215
It hasn't come
down in 20 years.

49
00:01:56.216 --> 00:01:57.516
It's not gonna happen today.

50
00:01:57.517 --> 00:01:58.750
Okay?

51
00:01:58.751 --> 00:02:01.386
Now hustle up, school
starts in the morning.

52
00:02:01.387 --> 00:02:03.355
Dad, I'm tired, and
Vee's gonna be pissed.

53
00:02:03.356 --> 00:02:04.690
Valerie's gonna be fine.

54
00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:06.859
She'll have extra
time to do her hair.

55
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:07.893
That's a bit sexist.

56
00:02:07.894 --> 00:02:09.061
How's that sexist?

57
00:02:09.062 --> 00:02:10.363
Well, it's
definitely not woke.

58
00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:14.700
Me being non-white
makes me woke by default.

59
00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:15.701
Okay?

60
00:02:16.736 --> 00:02:19.471
Yeah, Dad, that's uh,
that's not how it works.

61
00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:21.740
Jake, (sighs) don't sass me.

62
00:02:21.741 --> 00:02:22.941
Okay?

63
00:02:22.942 --> 00:02:24.309
I came home early to
help you with this.

64
00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.278
(chuckles) Okay, don't
use me as an excuse

65
00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:26.478
so you can play hooky.

66
00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:29.849
Please? (scoffs)
(basketball thumping)

67
00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:35.888
Ah shit! (grunts)

68
00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:37.156
- You okay?
- Yeah.

69
00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:38.190
It's that shit knee again.

70
00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:39.191
I'm fine.

71
00:02:42.195 --> 00:02:43.195
Now you're stuck.

72
00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.365
Don't double dribble.

73
00:02:48.735 --> 00:02:50.669
(basketball thumps)
Square up your shoulders.

74
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:51.737
Don't forget to follow through-

75
00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:52.405
- The wrist.

76
00:02:52.405 --> 00:02:53.405
God, Dad, I know.

77
00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:57.676
(basketball thumps)
(hoop clatters)

78
00:02:57.677 --> 00:02:58.478
What was that?

79
00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:59.545
You didn't follow through.

80
00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:01.613
I did.
(basketball thumps)

81
00:03:01.614 --> 00:03:02.448
Okay.

82
00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:03.682
Let's try again, okay?

83
00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:05.184
This time, drive to the hoop.

84
00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:07.085
- Dad, can we just please-
- Come on.

85
00:03:07.086 --> 00:03:08.086
Let's go.

86
00:03:09.322 --> 00:03:12.425
(basketball thumping)

87
00:03:15.995 --> 00:03:17.663
(Jake exclaims)
Shit.

88
00:03:17.664 --> 00:03:18.931
Jake, you all right?
No!

89
00:03:18.932 --> 00:03:20.299
You smashed the
ball into my hand.

90
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.934
Let's see.

91
00:03:21.935 --> 00:03:24.036
Ah, your uncle used to do
that to me all the time.

92
00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:25.305
Yeah, and look at you now!

93
00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:31.210
You'll be fine.

94
00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:32.311
Shake it off.

95
00:03:32.312 --> 00:03:33.679
(Jake stammers)

96
00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.680
I'm done, Dad!

97
00:03:36.082 --> 00:03:37.082
Jake.

98
00:03:40.853 --> 00:03:41.853
Goddammit.

99
00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:51.598
(soft introspective music)
(truck rumbling and hissing)

100
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.737
(door creaks and thuds)

101
00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.540
(soft introspective
music continues)

102
00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:05.345
(door creaking and thudding)

103
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.420
(basketball thumping faintly)

104
00:04:23.863 --> 00:04:28.434
(soft introspective
music continues)

105
00:04:45.585 --> 00:04:48.887
(basketball thumping faintly)

106
00:04:48.888 --> 00:04:53.759
(soft introspective
music continues)

107
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.630
(basketball thumping faintly)

108
00:05:06.773 --> 00:05:11.344
(soft introspective
music continues)

109
00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:16.416
(camera clicks)

110
00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:29.328
(sighs) I don't
have any new one.

111
00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:31.330
(door knocks and creaks)

112
00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:32.331
Hey.

113
00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:36.468
This is all I could
find in your closet.

114
00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:37.503
(chuckles) Thanks.

115
00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:41.039
So, what, he just, like,

116
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.141
smashed the ball back at you?
He's an overaggro

117
00:05:43.142 --> 00:05:45.678
washed-up sack of leftovers
trying to relive his...

118
00:05:46.913 --> 00:05:48.313
(Vee laughs)

119
00:05:48.314 --> 00:05:49.315
What?

120
00:05:54.554 --> 00:05:56.288
Yeah, I don't know.

121
00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:58.591
Maybe I drove too hard to
the net when I wasn't open.

122
00:06:00.927 --> 00:06:03.295
So what's gonna
happen with tryouts now?

123
00:06:03.296 --> 00:06:05.163
Mm, I don't know.

124
00:06:05.164 --> 00:06:07.165
Stay on as Coach's assistant.

125
00:06:07.166 --> 00:06:09.134
Social media manager.

126
00:06:09.135 --> 00:06:10.536
(chuckles) Right, thanks.

127
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.872
On the bright side, if you
can't try out for basketball,

128
00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:15.608
then that means
more time with me.

129
00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:18.878
Maybe we could
finally, you know.

130
00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:25.183
(giggles) So, my
sister finally caved

131
00:06:25.184 --> 00:06:26.819
and bought me a pack of condoms.

132
00:06:28.955 --> 00:06:29.822
Oh.

133
00:06:29.823 --> 00:06:32.257
Wow, that's, uh, that's so-

134
00:06:32.258 --> 00:06:33.892
- Awesome of her, right?

135
00:06:33.893 --> 00:06:35.695
Yeah, yeah.

136
00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:39.064
Are you crazy?

137
00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:39.899
What?

138
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.133
Your dad's still shooting hoops.

139
00:06:41.134 --> 00:06:43.068
Janet's out, and no
one else is home.

140
00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:44.669
Vee, this feels kind
of risky, maybe we-

141
00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:47.839
- Yeah, that's what
makes it hot. (giggles)

142
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.711
(basketball thumping faintly)

143
00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.148
Okay, Vee?

144
00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:57.816
Vee.

145
00:06:57.817 --> 00:06:59.084
I love you.

146
00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:01.720
- And I love you.
- Wait, we said we would wait.

147
00:07:01.721 --> 00:07:02.688
Until we move in together?

148
00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:04.790
That's like a year away.

149
00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:06.925
This is just,
this is a big deal.

150
00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:10.162
I like your big
deal. (chuckles)

151
00:07:10.163 --> 00:07:11.030
Soon.

152
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:11.931
Soon, okay?

153
00:07:11.932 --> 00:07:13.298
Seriously.

154
00:07:13.299 --> 00:07:14.299
I promise.

155
00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:18.871
(Vee sighs)

156
00:07:20.239 --> 00:07:22.542
(Vee sighs)

157
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.648
(Jake grunts)
(Vee giggling)

158
00:07:29.649 --> 00:07:31.684
Well, how's the kitchen doing?

159
00:07:33.753 --> 00:07:35.621
I don't know, in an hour or so.

160
00:07:36.656 --> 00:07:38.223
Well, this was important, too.

161
00:07:38.224 --> 00:07:39.224
For Jake.

162
00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:42.195
(door creaking)
Yeah.

163
00:07:42.195 --> 00:07:43.195
Hold on.

164
00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:45.798
(door thuds)
How's the hand?

165
00:07:50.636 --> 00:07:54.707
(sighs) Just, uh, take
it easy tonight, okay?

166
00:07:56.275 --> 00:07:59.144
They're gonna be, uh,
drinking at this thing?

167
00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:01.079
Yeah, like you didn't
drink at our age, Dad.

168
00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.247
Come on.

169
00:08:02.248 --> 00:08:03.928
How do you think I
became a dad so young?

170
00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:08.486
Just, uh, don't overdo it.

171
00:08:08.487 --> 00:08:09.588
Okay?

172
00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:11.591
And if you do, wrap it up.

173
00:08:12.592 --> 00:08:15.227
Uh...
(both chuckle awkwardly)

174
00:08:15.228 --> 00:08:16.728
What time are
you gonna be home?

175
00:08:16.729 --> 00:08:18.630
Don't worry, he's in
good hands, Mr. Wong.

176
00:08:18.631 --> 00:08:20.065
All right.

177
00:08:20.066 --> 00:08:21.066
Have fun, you two.

178
00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:24.669
- I told you.
- "Wrap it up, Jake.

179
00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:25.704
"Wrap it up."
"Wrap it up."

180
00:08:25.705 --> 00:08:26.505
"Wrap it up."
(Vee laughing)

181
00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:27.806
Bye!

182
00:08:27.807 --> 00:08:32.612
(energetic rap music)
(camera clicking)

183
00:08:45.224 --> 00:08:47.760
(phones toning)

184
00:08:51.864 --> 00:08:56.234
(energetic rap music continues)

185
00:08:56.235 --> 00:08:59.005
(crowd chattering)

186
00:09:01.674 --> 00:09:02.642
(exhales) What up, boys?

187
00:09:02.643 --> 00:09:04.542
- What up, man?
- Yo, yo.

188
00:09:04.543 --> 00:09:05.844
What's up?

189
00:09:05.845 --> 00:09:07.325
Looks like Penny
finally filled out.

190
00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:11.383
Nice.

191
00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:15.520
Dude, did you see that new
bikini shot on Mary's Robogram?

192
00:09:15.521 --> 00:09:16.589
Look, look.

193
00:09:18.524 --> 00:09:20.258
(both laughing)

194
00:09:20.259 --> 00:09:21.493
You know, you guys
ever try actually,

195
00:09:21.494 --> 00:09:23.728
like, talking to these girls?

196
00:09:23.729 --> 00:09:26.264
Dude, I barely had the
nerve to invite them,

197
00:09:26.265 --> 00:09:30.269
so, like, what am I gonna
say to them? (scoffs)

198
00:09:31.537 --> 00:09:33.772
Oh, you too cool for boobs now?

199
00:09:33.773 --> 00:09:36.007
Valerie finally cave?

200
00:09:36.008 --> 00:09:37.542
Shit.

201
00:09:37.543 --> 00:09:38.777
Are you getting some?
No, okay?

202
00:09:38.778 --> 00:09:39.911
Trust me, I've tried.

203
00:09:39.912 --> 00:09:41.580
She still won't budge.

204
00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:43.248
After almost two
years together?

205
00:09:43.249 --> 00:09:44.649
Yeah, she's
waiting for marriage.

206
00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:46.117
Whatever.

207
00:09:46.118 --> 00:09:48.486
I mean, at least she's
doing hand stuff, right?

208
00:09:48.487 --> 00:09:49.754
God's okay with hand stuff.

209
00:09:49.755 --> 00:09:50.790
And mouth stuff.

210
00:09:51.857 --> 00:09:53.925
Yeah, yeah, totally.

211
00:09:53.926 --> 00:09:55.226
Totally.

212
00:09:55.227 --> 00:09:57.929
Jake, milk it for
as long as you can.

213
00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:02.167
She's the one milkin'
it, am I right? (laughs)

214
00:10:02.168 --> 00:10:03.234
What happened?

215
00:10:03.235 --> 00:10:04.836
My dad played
on the rough side.

216
00:10:04.837 --> 00:10:06.104
You gonna be okay for tryouts?

217
00:10:06.105 --> 00:10:07.172
Yeah, don't worry about me.

218
00:10:07.173 --> 00:10:08.173
I got my right.

219
00:10:10.142 --> 00:10:13.111
Uh, yo, not to sound
like an asshole, man, but-

220
00:10:13.112 --> 00:10:15.447
- You've never made the
team with a good hand,

221
00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:17.882
so don't know how you're
gonna pull this off.

222
00:10:17.883 --> 00:10:19.718
Yeah, screw you guys, man.
(Both laughing)

223
00:10:19.719 --> 00:10:20.719
No, where's Val?

224
00:10:22.788 --> 00:10:25.658
(energetic rap music continues)

225
00:10:27.193 --> 00:10:31.664
(dishes clinking)
(diners chattering faintly)

226
00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:37.669
(George grunting painfully)

227
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:39.872
Hey, hun, how was the...

228
00:10:41.207 --> 00:10:42.408
What'd you do?

229
00:10:44.377 --> 00:10:46.711
What happened to cooling
it with the basketball?

230
00:10:46.712 --> 00:10:47.747
I like basketball.

231
00:10:55.821 --> 00:10:58.089
You screw up your
knee whenever you play.

232
00:10:58.090 --> 00:10:59.090
I don't always.

233
00:11:00.593 --> 00:11:01.726
And while you were
out training Jake

234
00:11:01.727 --> 00:11:03.495
for a sport he
doesn't even like-

235
00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:04.596
- Don't say that.

236
00:11:04.597 --> 00:11:06.131
He likes it.

237
00:11:06.132 --> 00:11:08.199
- He likes being-
- He's trying...

238
00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.769
He likes being the
coach's assistant.

239
00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:12.303
He's only doing that

240
00:11:12.304 --> 00:11:14.573
so he can be on the court
where he wants to be.

241
00:11:18.277 --> 00:11:20.879
We got slammed, and now what?

242
00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.480
How are you gonna help
out with that limp?

243
00:11:22.481 --> 00:11:25.785
Can we please not start
30 seconds into my arrival?

244
00:11:35.327 --> 00:11:36.327
You're right.

245
00:11:41.067 --> 00:11:43.835
I'm sorry for jumping
down your throat.

246
00:11:43.836 --> 00:11:45.670
I should have been here.

247
00:11:45.671 --> 00:11:47.873
I'm sorry, too.

248
00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:53.011
I'm gonna go check
on the kitchen.

249
00:11:53.012 --> 00:11:55.246
(scoffs) Oh,
you're a cook now?

250
00:11:55.247 --> 00:11:56.247
Don't start.

251
00:11:58.751 --> 00:12:03.622
(sighs heavily)
(soft upbeat music)

252
00:12:06.258 --> 00:12:08.994
(camera beeping)

253
00:12:11.163 --> 00:12:12.964
- Hey. (laughs)
- Hey.

254
00:12:12.965 --> 00:12:14.065
Can I see?

255
00:12:14.066 --> 00:12:15.233
Okay, if I could
afford a new lens,

256
00:12:15.234 --> 00:12:16.634
they'd turn out, like,
way better, but...

257
00:12:16.635 --> 00:12:18.503
(camera beeping)

258
00:12:18.504 --> 00:12:20.705
[Vee] These are great, babe.

259
00:12:20.706 --> 00:12:22.140
Yeah.
(Vee laughs)

260
00:12:22.141 --> 00:12:23.174
Can we?

261
00:12:23.175 --> 00:12:24.943
Here.
Yeah.

262
00:12:24.944 --> 00:12:26.878
(phone chimes)
Happy Labor Day, everyone.

263
00:12:26.879 --> 00:12:28.580
Can't believe we
start our last year

264
00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:29.681
of high school tomorrow.

265
00:12:29.682 --> 00:12:30.849
So exciting!

266
00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:32.050
Uh, the most exciting.

267
00:12:32.051 --> 00:12:32.885
Leopards rule!

268
00:12:32.886 --> 00:12:34.787
Catch you leopards in the AM.

269
00:12:36.288 --> 00:12:37.156
No, my hair's messed.

270
00:12:37.156 --> 00:12:38.124
Can we do it again?

271
00:12:38.125 --> 00:12:39.290
Yeah.

272
00:12:39.291 --> 00:12:41.726
Okay. (clears throat)

273
00:12:41.727 --> 00:12:43.161
(basketball thumping)
(players chattering)

274
00:12:43.162 --> 00:12:44.295
- Hey.
- Babe...

275
00:12:44.296 --> 00:12:46.264
What?
One second.

276
00:12:46.265 --> 00:12:48.199
(sighs) Okay.

277
00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.969
(phone chimes)
Happy Labor Day, everyone!

278
00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:52.771
Can't believe we
start our last year

279
00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:56.007
of high school
together. (squeals)

280
00:12:56.008 --> 00:13:00.812
(basketball thumping)
(soft upbeat music continues)

281
00:13:00.813 --> 00:13:05.751
(players chattering)
(basketball thumping)

282
00:13:09.889 --> 00:13:14.827
[Player] Whoa, whoa!
(camera clicking)

283
00:13:19.398 --> 00:13:24.336
(soft upbeat music continues)
(camera clicking)

284
00:13:31.243 --> 00:13:34.212
(camera clicking)

285
00:13:34.213 --> 00:13:35.847
(players chattering)
(players laughing)

286
00:13:35.848 --> 00:13:37.415
- Nice.
- [Player] Let's go

287
00:13:37.416 --> 00:13:39.017
come on (camera clicking)

288
00:13:39.018 --> 00:13:40.185
Let's go.
[Player] Post up, post up!

289
00:13:40.186 --> 00:13:41.153
[Player] Yeah, on
me, on me, on me.

290
00:13:41.154 --> 00:13:43.888
(camera clicking)

291
00:13:43.889 --> 00:13:47.625
- [Player] Get off me!
- [Player] Nice!

292
00:13:47.626 --> 00:13:49.694
(hoop clattering)
(camera clicking)

293
00:13:49.695 --> 00:13:51.263
- Okay, okay.
- Ooh!

294
00:13:52.932 --> 00:13:55.433
(camera clicking)
[Player] Kid's on fire.

295
00:13:55.434 --> 00:13:56.434
Sam.

296
00:13:57.102 --> 00:13:58.536
Hey, Jake.
(camera clicks)

297
00:13:58.537 --> 00:14:00.004
You want in?

298
00:14:00.005 --> 00:14:00.873
Shit, wait, wait! (groans)
(camera clatters)

299
00:14:00.874 --> 00:14:02.240
(everyone gasps)
Shit, dude!

300
00:14:02.241 --> 00:14:03.042
Ron, shit!

301
00:14:03.043 --> 00:14:04.475
What did you do that for?

302
00:14:04.476 --> 00:14:07.245
Sorry, Val, I was just
trying to get Jake in the game.

303
00:14:07.246 --> 00:14:09.882
Just thought he'd like to
get off the bench for once.

304
00:14:11.016 --> 00:14:12.584
Ball didn't hit
you, though, did it?

305
00:14:12.585 --> 00:14:13.885
Ew.

306
00:14:13.886 --> 00:14:14.553
Are you okay?
He's an asshole.

307
00:14:14.553 --> 00:14:15.553
I know.

308
00:14:16.422 --> 00:14:17.289
Shit, dude.

309
00:14:17.289 --> 00:14:18.289
Does it hurt?

310
00:14:19.124 --> 00:14:20.658
Ugh, come on!

311
00:14:20.659 --> 00:14:22.026
Goddammit!

312
00:14:22.027 --> 00:14:23.194
Ron, look what you did.

313
00:14:23.195 --> 00:14:25.330
- Not cool, man.
- He dropped it, not me!

314
00:14:25.331 --> 00:14:26.331
- Screw you!
- What?

315
00:14:35.007 --> 00:14:36.041
We playing or what?

316
00:14:41.447 --> 00:14:44.048
Why do you hang
out with him again?

317
00:14:44.049 --> 00:14:46.417
He's the team
captain and the MVP.

318
00:14:46.418 --> 00:14:47.619
We need him.

319
00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:48.920
Those are lame excuses, guys.

320
00:14:48.921 --> 00:14:51.456
- [Ron] Cheers! (laughs)
- Yeah.

321
00:14:51.457 --> 00:14:52.457
I know.

322
00:14:53.659 --> 00:14:54.859
Well, don't let
me hold you up.

323
00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:55.927
Jake, come on, don't go.

324
00:14:55.928 --> 00:14:57.462
Yeah, I can't play, Sam, so...

325
00:14:57.463 --> 00:14:58.897
[Player] Yo, boys,

326
00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:01.532
let's go play!
Thanks for the party.

327
00:15:01.533 --> 00:15:05.037
(soft introspective music)

328
00:15:11.677 --> 00:15:16.448
(Jake sighs)
(basketball thumping)

329
00:15:22.054 --> 00:15:25.891
(basketball thumping rapidly)

330
00:15:27.326 --> 00:15:31.797
(soft introspective
music continues)

331
00:15:34.333 --> 00:15:36.969
(food sizzling)

332
00:15:45.044 --> 00:15:45.911
Hey.

333
00:15:45.912 --> 00:15:47.345
- Hey.
- You hungry?

334
00:15:47.346 --> 00:15:48.880
Always.

335
00:15:48.881 --> 00:15:50.081
What are you doing home?

336
00:15:50.082 --> 00:15:51.249
I live here, too, you know.

337
00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:53.084
Oh, do you?

338
00:15:53.085 --> 00:15:55.053
- Har-har.
- [Jake] Mm-hmm.

339
00:15:55.054 --> 00:15:57.221
I'm taking it easy tonight.

340
00:15:57.222 --> 00:15:58.489
Gotta get my head
screwed on straight

341
00:15:58.490 --> 00:15:59.792
for this next semester.

342
00:16:04.196 --> 00:16:05.196
Okay.

343
00:16:06.598 --> 00:16:09.567
Here you go.
Shit, Janet.

344
00:16:09.568 --> 00:16:10.635
That smells amazing.

345
00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:11.636
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

346
00:16:12.871 --> 00:16:14.172
Thank you.

347
00:16:14.173 --> 00:16:15.074
Okay, I'm gonna
try my right hand.

348
00:16:15.075 --> 00:16:17.108
Okay, let's see you do it.

349
00:16:17.109 --> 00:16:22.081
(chopsticks clattering)
(Janet laughs)

350
00:16:25.117 --> 00:16:26.117
Hm.

351
00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:28.753
Well?

352
00:16:28.754 --> 00:16:30.288
It's good.

353
00:16:30.289 --> 00:16:31.289
That's it?

354
00:16:32.191 --> 00:16:33.025
Yeah.

355
00:16:33.026 --> 00:16:34.292
What do you want, a medal?

356
00:16:34.293 --> 00:16:36.194
(Janet scoffs)

357
00:16:36.195 --> 00:16:37.295
Oh yeah?

358
00:16:37.296 --> 00:16:39.131
Well, does it not
remind you of anything?

359
00:16:41.367 --> 00:16:43.501
It reminds me of noodles,
so that's pretty good.

360
00:16:43.502 --> 00:16:44.669
(Janet sighs)

361
00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:45.670
Look behind you.

362
00:16:49.808 --> 00:16:51.275
Shit, you found
her recipe book?

363
00:16:51.276 --> 00:16:52.977
No, just going from memory.

364
00:16:52.978 --> 00:16:54.245
Well, you nailed it.

365
00:16:54.246 --> 00:16:57.081
Uh, says the palate
of a 17-year-old.

366
00:16:57.082 --> 00:16:58.349
Hey, I'm refined.

367
00:16:58.350 --> 00:16:59.350
Okay?

368
00:17:02.321 --> 00:17:03.488
Really?

369
00:17:03.489 --> 00:17:04.789
Let me see.
Hey, just eat your own.

370
00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:06.230
What is wrong with you?
Let me try.

371
00:17:10.295 --> 00:17:11.295
Mmm...

372
00:17:12.765 --> 00:17:13.866
Something's missing.

373
00:17:19.638 --> 00:17:21.439
Excited about school starting?

374
00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.640
(Jake scoffs)

375
00:17:22.641 --> 00:17:23.841
Nah.

376
00:17:23.842 --> 00:17:25.410
You?

377
00:17:25.411 --> 00:17:26.544
Yes and no.

378
00:17:26.545 --> 00:17:28.880
I mean, this term's
focusing on baking,

379
00:17:28.881 --> 00:17:30.916
and I'm no baker, so...

380
00:17:32.818 --> 00:17:33.818
Hm.

381
00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:37.322
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

382
00:17:39.091 --> 00:17:41.492
How'd you know for
sure that you, like,

383
00:17:41.493 --> 00:17:44.862
you know, wanted to go
into culinary school?

384
00:17:44.863 --> 00:17:45.964
Mm...

385
00:17:47.466 --> 00:17:50.202
Felt it in my
bones, as they say.

386
00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:53.905
- Hmm.
- Why?

387
00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:55.240
Eh, I dunno.

388
00:17:56.208 --> 00:17:57.843
What do your bones tell you?

389
00:17:59.344 --> 00:18:01.479
And please don't say basketball.

390
00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.916
(scoffs) Oh my God,
sometimes I just wish that-

391
00:18:05.451 --> 00:18:06.451
- Hey, you two.

392
00:18:07.553 --> 00:18:08.553
Hey, Mom.

393
00:18:10.556 --> 00:18:11.457
Is your Dad here?

394
00:18:11.457 --> 00:18:12.457
Nope.

395
00:18:16.528 --> 00:18:19.063
(phone clicks)
Don't fill up on that.

396
00:18:19.064 --> 00:18:20.365
I brought home wrong orders.

397
00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:22.935
But I cooked.

398
00:18:25.571 --> 00:18:26.838
Mom.

399
00:18:26.839 --> 00:18:28.473
Mom?

400
00:18:28.474 --> 00:18:29.474
I cooked.

401
00:18:32.177 --> 00:18:33.644
Grandma's noodles.

402
00:18:33.645 --> 00:18:36.514
Yeah, but something's
missing, though.

403
00:18:36.515 --> 00:18:37.515
Maybe you can help?

404
00:18:40.319 --> 00:18:43.020
I started work
today at 10:00 AM.

405
00:18:43.021 --> 00:18:44.322
I've been starting at 10:00

406
00:18:44.323 --> 00:18:47.492
and finishing at 11:00
for almost 20 years.

407
00:18:47.493 --> 00:18:49.293
Do you really want to
work hours like that?

408
00:18:49.294 --> 00:18:51.462
If it's with food, yes.

409
00:18:51.463 --> 00:18:53.931
(sighs) You know, we
are not even asking you

410
00:18:53.932 --> 00:18:57.301
to be a doctor or a lawyer
like our parents did.

411
00:18:57.302 --> 00:18:59.971
You know, why not be a plumber?

412
00:18:59.972 --> 00:19:01.339
Do you know how much they charge

413
00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:03.308
to fix a clog in the
middle of dinner service?

414
00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:08.212
You know, it's just, all
that tuition and for what?

415
00:19:08.213 --> 00:19:09.680
Which I'm paying myself,

416
00:19:09.681 --> 00:19:11.315
thank you very much.
Yeah, but we'll be paying

417
00:19:11.316 --> 00:19:13.050
for whatever it is
that you decide to do

418
00:19:13.051 --> 00:19:14.685
once the kitchen burns you out.

419
00:19:14.686 --> 00:19:15.953
(Janet scoffs)

420
00:19:15.954 --> 00:19:17.188
You should try
some, though, Mom.

421
00:19:17.189 --> 00:19:18.090
Like, seriously.

422
00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:19.090
It's freaking good.

423
00:19:20.692 --> 00:19:21.692
Just give it a taste.

424
00:19:31.837 --> 00:19:33.237
See?

425
00:19:33.238 --> 00:19:35.274
It's, it's good, right?

426
00:19:37.843 --> 00:19:41.212
(sighs) You don't get
into the restaurant biz.

427
00:19:41.213 --> 00:19:42.680
Do anything else.

428
00:19:42.681 --> 00:19:43.681
Anything.

429
00:19:45.217 --> 00:19:46.485
I'm going to bed.
Night!

430
00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:53.959
Where do you think Dad is?

431
00:19:56.295 --> 00:20:01.032
(sighs) uh-huh.
(soft thoughtful music)

432
00:20:01.033 --> 00:20:03.635
(camera beeps)

433
00:20:07.372 --> 00:20:12.311
(camera beeps)
(truck rumbling and hissing)

434
00:20:15.714 --> 00:20:17.848
(door thuds)

435
00:20:17.849 --> 00:20:21.987
(soft thoughtful
music continues)

436
00:20:34.633 --> 00:20:39.638
(blows softly)
(lens scratches)

437
00:20:49.514 --> 00:20:52.951
(soft upbeat music)
(students chattering)

438
00:20:54.886 --> 00:20:58.457
(phones chiming and beeping)

439
00:21:02.194 --> 00:21:03.694
[Sam] So you don't remember?

440
00:21:03.695 --> 00:21:04.829
[Gary] No.

441
00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:05.930
Hey!

442
00:21:05.931 --> 00:21:07.665
How you doing?
(fingers snap)

443
00:21:07.666 --> 00:21:09.700
Listen, we've talked about it,

444
00:21:09.701 --> 00:21:12.570
and we're sorry about what
happened yesterday, we didn't-

445
00:21:12.571 --> 00:21:13.771
- Yeah, don't worry
about it, we're all good.

446
00:21:13.772 --> 00:21:14.805
- Yeah?
- Yeah, we're good.

447
00:21:14.806 --> 00:21:15.973
- All right.
- Cool?

448
00:21:15.974 --> 00:21:16.942
- Yeah.
- Hey, we'll see you at lunch,

449
00:21:16.942 --> 00:21:17.643
then.
See you at lunch.

450
00:21:17.643 --> 00:21:18.643
See ya.

451
00:21:21.546 --> 00:21:22.680
Hey.

452
00:21:22.681 --> 00:21:24.215
So yesterday in your
room was really hot.

453
00:21:24.216 --> 00:21:25.616
Hmm?

454
00:21:25.617 --> 00:21:26.551
Can we do it again?

455
00:21:26.552 --> 00:21:27.685
Soon?

456
00:21:27.686 --> 00:21:29.487
Today?
(locker clatters)

457
00:21:29.488 --> 00:21:30.288
Yes?

458
00:21:30.289 --> 00:21:31.389
You know, I want to,

459
00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:32.657
but, like, Janet might be home,

460
00:21:32.658 --> 00:21:34.625
and I don't know her
schedule this term.

461
00:21:34.626 --> 00:21:36.093
Like she even cares.

462
00:21:36.094 --> 00:21:37.528
Besides, we'll
just tell her that

463
00:21:37.529 --> 00:21:39.330
we're looking at university
brochures in your bedroom.

464
00:21:39.331 --> 00:21:40.364
Which we should
actually start doing,

465
00:21:40.365 --> 00:21:41.999
by the way.
(bell ringing)

466
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:42.868
Okay, yes.

467
00:21:42.869 --> 00:21:44.101
Okay. Brochures.

468
00:21:44.102 --> 00:21:45.070
I promise.
And the other thing?

469
00:21:45.071 --> 00:21:46.871
Yeah, and the other thing.

470
00:21:46.872 --> 00:21:47.872
Okay.

471
00:21:47.873 --> 00:21:49.007
- Bye.
- Bye.

472
00:21:51.076 --> 00:21:55.346
(locker clatters)
(students chattering)

473
00:21:55.347 --> 00:21:57.948
(blow thuds)
(both grunting)

474
00:21:57.949 --> 00:21:59.116
Oh shit, sorry.

475
00:21:59.117 --> 00:22:01.887
I didn't see you there.
It's my bad.

476
00:22:04.056 --> 00:22:05.923
You live across
the alley, right?

477
00:22:05.924 --> 00:22:07.525
Yeah.

478
00:22:07.526 --> 00:22:08.193
Yeah, that's me.

479
00:22:08.194 --> 00:22:09.293
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

480
00:22:09.294 --> 00:22:10.574
You moving in on Labor Day, huh?

481
00:22:11.596 --> 00:22:12.431
Yeah!

482
00:22:12.432 --> 00:22:14.399
Yeah, not by choice, believe me.

483
00:22:17.869 --> 00:22:19.236
Uh, um...

484
00:22:19.237 --> 00:22:22.174
Um.
Dude, you look lost.

485
00:22:23.241 --> 00:22:24.241
I...

486
00:22:25.811 --> 00:22:27.278
I am.
You are.

487
00:22:27.279 --> 00:22:28.046
You are, right? (chuckles)
Yeah, yeah. (chuckles)

488
00:22:28.047 --> 00:22:29.180
Can I see that?

489
00:22:29.181 --> 00:22:31.015
- Yeah.
- Ooh, Mr. Roberts?

490
00:22:31.016 --> 00:22:32.650
- Mm-hmm.
- That's brutal.

491
00:22:32.651 --> 00:22:33.518
Trust me.

492
00:22:33.518 --> 00:22:34.486
Uh, final bell's about to go.

493
00:22:34.486 --> 00:22:35.486
Follow me.

494
00:22:36.455 --> 00:22:38.689
No, this way.
I just went that way.

495
00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:39.690
Yeah, come on!

496
00:22:43.328 --> 00:22:44.795
You sure you know
where you're going?

497
00:22:44.796 --> 00:22:46.264
Yeah, trust me.

498
00:22:48.166 --> 00:22:53.138
(both panting)
(footsteps thudding)

499
00:22:54.639 --> 00:22:56.374
This is it.

500
00:22:56.375 --> 00:22:57.342
[Teacher] All right,
everyone, today-

501
00:22:57.342 --> 00:22:58.276
- You're pretty fast.
- Yeah.

502
00:22:58.277 --> 00:22:59.944
You're not too bad yourself.

503
00:22:59.945 --> 00:23:01.011
I'm, I'm Jake.

504
00:23:01.012 --> 00:23:01.913
Jake Wong.

505
00:23:01.914 --> 00:23:03.181
Hey, Aleks Chen.

506
00:23:04.583 --> 00:23:05.583
Shit, you okay?

507
00:23:07.052 --> 00:23:08.119
Yeah.

508
00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.787
Yeah, I'm okay.

509
00:23:09.788 --> 00:23:11.788
It's just, you know, it's
an old basketball injury.

510
00:23:12.624 --> 00:23:14.558
I actually, um, I
play, too, you know.

511
00:23:14.559 --> 00:23:15.227
Yeah?

512
00:23:15.228 --> 00:23:16.228
- Yeah.
- Sweet.

513
00:23:16.228 --> 00:23:17.028
We should play some time.

514
00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:18.796
Once this gets better.

515
00:23:18.797 --> 00:23:20.030
Yeah, that sounds like fun.

516
00:23:20.031 --> 00:23:20.999
- Cool.
- Cool.

517
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.867
Well, thanks for the GPS.

518
00:23:22.868 --> 00:23:24.402
Don't mention it.

519
00:23:24.403 --> 00:23:26.737
231, up the stairs.

520
00:23:26.738 --> 00:23:27.738
- Good luck.
- Cool.

521
00:23:29.274 --> 00:23:32.377
(soft hopeful music)

522
00:23:36.782 --> 00:23:40.218
(bell ringing)
Oh shit.

523
00:23:48.627 --> 00:23:51.229
(keys clacking)

524
00:23:53.498 --> 00:23:57.469
(soft hopeful music continues)

525
00:24:16.688 --> 00:24:18.022
Let's take a break.

526
00:24:18.023 --> 00:24:19.523
It's the weekend!

527
00:24:19.524 --> 00:24:21.425
I'm already taking a break.

528
00:24:21.426 --> 00:24:22.426
I've been taking a break
for the last two hours.

529
00:24:22.427 --> 00:24:24.195
What have you been doing?

530
00:24:24.196 --> 00:24:25.764
(laughs) Come on!

531
00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:38.043
(lips smacking)

532
00:24:40.479 --> 00:24:42.646
Mm, wait, wait, wait.

533
00:24:42.647 --> 00:24:44.114
What's wrong?

534
00:24:44.115 --> 00:24:45.115
Nothing's wrong.

535
00:24:46.451 --> 00:24:48.053
Why don't you wanna have sex?

536
00:24:49.254 --> 00:24:50.888
(stammers) Okay, it's,

537
00:24:50.889 --> 00:24:53.891
it's not that I don't
want to have sex.

538
00:24:53.892 --> 00:24:54.925
What?

539
00:24:54.926 --> 00:24:56.493
I want it to be special, too,

540
00:24:56.494 --> 00:24:59.463
but what makes it special
is that it's you and me.

541
00:24:59.464 --> 00:25:02.299
I know that,
but this is, like,

542
00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.768
this is a big thing
we're talking about here.

543
00:25:04.769 --> 00:25:06.403
We've done, like,
everything else,

544
00:25:06.404 --> 00:25:07.539
what's the difference?

545
00:25:10.041 --> 00:25:10.942
Is it me?

546
00:25:10.943 --> 00:25:11.943
Or...
No.

547
00:25:11.944 --> 00:25:13.178
Hey, no.

548
00:25:14.079 --> 00:25:15.713
Girls want sex, too, you know.

549
00:25:15.714 --> 00:25:16.714
I know that.

550
00:25:18.917 --> 00:25:20.384
I don't know, Vee.

551
00:25:20.385 --> 00:25:21.686
I think I'm just scared.

552
00:25:23.889 --> 00:25:24.889
(stammers) Of what?

553
00:25:28.393 --> 00:25:29.628
Of everything changing.

554
00:25:31.129 --> 00:25:32.863
Nothing's gonna
change, I promise.

555
00:25:32.864 --> 00:25:34.431
No, you can't
promise that, Vee.

556
00:25:34.432 --> 00:25:36.501
I can because I love you.

557
00:25:40.171 --> 00:25:41.339
I love you, too, Vee.

558
00:25:43.441 --> 00:25:44.509
You're my best friend.

559
00:25:49.147 --> 00:25:51.783
(lips smacking)

560
00:25:55.554 --> 00:25:56.754
Take this off for me?

561
00:25:56.755 --> 00:25:57.755
Yeah.

562
00:26:04.029 --> 00:26:06.665
(Jake chuckles)

563
00:26:08.199 --> 00:26:09.100
(Vee laughing)
You know,

564
00:26:09.101 --> 00:26:10.567
if I had two hands,

565
00:26:10.568 --> 00:26:13.537
it'd be million times easier.
I know, I know.

566
00:26:13.538 --> 00:26:16.206
- (grunts) Ow, ow.
- (laughs) Be careful.

567
00:26:16.207 --> 00:26:17.175
Your hand.

568
00:26:17.176 --> 00:26:18.910
Slowly, slowly.
Okay.

569
00:26:21.646 --> 00:26:24.282
(lips smacking)

570
00:26:27.919 --> 00:26:28.919
Wait right here.

571
00:26:37.495 --> 00:26:39.397
(stammers) Are we, really?

572
00:26:41.032 --> 00:26:42.032
Yeah.

573
00:26:45.203 --> 00:26:47.805
(zipper buzzing)
(wrapper crinkling)

574
00:26:47.806 --> 00:26:49.773
(sighs) I got it.
You sure?

575
00:26:49.774 --> 00:26:53.377
Yeah. (grunts)

576
00:26:53.378 --> 00:26:57.648
(Jake spits)
(Vee laughs)

577
00:26:57.649 --> 00:27:01.386
(both sighing and grunting)

578
00:27:06.825 --> 00:27:10.260
(wrapper crinkling)

579
00:27:10.261 --> 00:27:12.863
I love you so much, Vee.

580
00:27:12.864 --> 00:27:14.199
I love you too.

581
00:27:18.737 --> 00:27:23.675
(both moaning softly)
(soft gentle music)

582
00:27:38.289 --> 00:27:40.959
(troubled music)

583
00:27:46.431 --> 00:27:50.001
(diners chattering faintly)

584
00:27:54.839 --> 00:27:56.241
[George] Andrea.

585
00:27:57.208 --> 00:27:58.842
Andrea.

586
00:27:58.843 --> 00:27:59.843
Andrea!

587
00:28:00.512 --> 00:28:01.512
Where you been?

588
00:28:02.914 --> 00:28:04.615
We're getting
hammered out there.

589
00:28:04.616 --> 00:28:06.350
Lucy called in sick, and
you're doing what, exactly?

590
00:28:06.351 --> 00:28:08.552
Dealing with a supply order.

591
00:28:08.553 --> 00:28:09.720
Stop daydreaming.

592
00:28:09.721 --> 00:28:11.522
We need to clear those tables.

593
00:28:11.523 --> 00:28:13.957
The office next door took the
entire staff out for dinner,

594
00:28:13.958 --> 00:28:15.859
and I can't handle
it with my knee.

595
00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:16.860
Okay.

596
00:28:17.595 --> 00:28:19.229
Just give me a second.

597
00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:20.464
For what?

598
00:28:20.465 --> 00:28:21.900
Andrea, hurry up!

599
00:28:23.535 --> 00:28:27.137
Don't talk to me like
this is my problem.

600
00:28:27.138 --> 00:28:28.873
This is your family's place.

601
00:28:29.741 --> 00:28:31.075
Jesus.
(stammers) My family?

602
00:28:31.076 --> 00:28:32.076
We're family.

603
00:28:33.344 --> 00:28:35.379
(Andrea sighs)

604
00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:36.380
I'm done.

605
00:28:37.315 --> 00:28:38.916
Where are you going?

606
00:28:38.917 --> 00:28:40.885
[Andrea] I'm sick
of Chinese food!

607
00:28:41.953 --> 00:28:44.422
(George sighs)

608
00:28:47.759 --> 00:28:49.360
- Just be careful.
- Thank you.

609
00:28:52.964 --> 00:28:54.431
That was amazing.

610
00:28:54.432 --> 00:28:55.866
You're amazing.

611
00:28:55.867 --> 00:28:58.303
- Hm? (laughs)
- Get outta here, Vee.

612
00:29:02.307 --> 00:29:03.575
- See you, J-Pop!
- Bye!

613
00:29:08.246 --> 00:29:13.084
(birds chirping)
(Jake sighs)

614
00:29:18.123 --> 00:29:21.059
(basketball thumping)

615
00:29:26.231 --> 00:29:27.931
Hey!

616
00:29:27.932 --> 00:29:28.867
J-Pop.

617
00:29:28.868 --> 00:29:30.668
(chuckles) You
heard that, huh?

618
00:29:32.103 --> 00:29:33.071
God.

619
00:29:33.071 --> 00:29:33.972
Sorry.

620
00:29:33.973 --> 00:29:35.105
Nah, don't be.

621
00:29:35.106 --> 00:29:36.106
It's cute.

622
00:29:37.075 --> 00:29:40.545
My boyfriend used to
call me Sexy Leksy.

623
00:29:42.013 --> 00:29:43.647
Ex-boyfriend, I mean.

624
00:29:43.648 --> 00:29:45.449
Oh, so you're, um-

625
00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:46.817
- A top.

626
00:29:46.818 --> 00:29:48.352
Yeah, I thought the
whole school knew.

627
00:29:48.353 --> 00:29:49.553
(Jake laughs)

628
00:29:49.554 --> 00:29:52.456
I was, I was gonna say single.

629
00:29:52.457 --> 00:29:53.790
Hmm.

630
00:29:53.791 --> 00:29:56.961
And yeah, they...
they know you're a top.

631
00:29:58.830 --> 00:29:59.830
Good.

632
00:30:02.534 --> 00:30:04.134
Been out here long?

633
00:30:04.135 --> 00:30:09.040
Yeah, just um dribbling
up and down the alley.

634
00:30:10.375 --> 00:30:11.508
- Mm.
- I don't have a net yet,

635
00:30:11.509 --> 00:30:12.776
so... (laughs)

636
00:30:12.777 --> 00:30:14.712
Hey, you, you can play
on mine if you want.

637
00:30:16.714 --> 00:30:19.850
I mean, it looks like
it's gonna fall apart.

638
00:30:19.851 --> 00:30:23.253
Yeah, no, it's definitely
a million years old, but...

639
00:30:23.254 --> 00:30:24.022
You break it, you buy it.

640
00:30:24.023 --> 00:30:25.389
How about that?

641
00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:26.257
You sure your
hand is up to it?

642
00:30:26.258 --> 00:30:27.391
Yeah!

643
00:30:27.392 --> 00:30:28.359
I'll be fine.

644
00:30:28.359 --> 00:30:29.359
Okay.

645
00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:34.698
(light upbeat music)

646
00:30:34.699 --> 00:30:36.266
You did that
practicing for tryouts?

647
00:30:36.267 --> 00:30:37.534
Uh, yeah.

648
00:30:37.535 --> 00:30:39.303
You trying out?
Yeah, definitely.

649
00:30:39.304 --> 00:30:40.304
Cool.

650
00:30:42.507 --> 00:30:45.410
Okay.
(hoop clatters)

651
00:30:46.578 --> 00:30:48.345
Everyone on the
team as good as you?

652
00:30:48.346 --> 00:30:50.147
(chuckles) Well, I've never
actually made the team, so...

653
00:30:50.148 --> 00:30:51.582
Hm.

654
00:30:51.583 --> 00:30:52.616
I can see why.

655
00:30:52.617 --> 00:30:53.884
(chuckles) Oh, shut up.

656
00:30:53.885 --> 00:30:55.219
You want friends at
school or not, huh?

657
00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:56.920
- I'm teasing!
- [Jake] Yeah, all right.

658
00:30:56.921 --> 00:30:57.988
Look, you only shoot and
dribble left-handed, right?

659
00:30:57.989 --> 00:30:58.957
Mm-hmm.

660
00:30:58.958 --> 00:31:00.424
You gotta learn both sides

661
00:31:00.425 --> 00:31:01.792
if you wanna make
it on the team.

662
00:31:01.793 --> 00:31:04.928
(basketball thumping)

663
00:31:04.929 --> 00:31:05.929
Cool?

664
00:31:06.831 --> 00:31:07.465
Uh, yes.

665
00:31:07.466 --> 00:31:09.199
Cool.

666
00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.001
Just like that, huh?

667
00:31:11.002 --> 00:31:12.437
So, line it up.

668
00:31:16.074 --> 00:31:17.074
There you go.

669
00:31:18.343 --> 00:31:20.477
Control your nerves.

670
00:31:20.478 --> 00:31:23.114
And follow through
with the wrist.

671
00:31:24.182 --> 00:31:25.415
You got it.

672
00:31:25.416 --> 00:31:26.617
Yeah.

673
00:31:26.618 --> 00:31:27.919
Yeah, I got it.

674
00:31:30.888 --> 00:31:33.924
(basketball thumping)

675
00:31:33.925 --> 00:31:35.058
Huh.

676
00:31:35.059 --> 00:31:35.927
See?

677
00:31:35.928 --> 00:31:37.661
- Damn!
- Stick with me,

678
00:31:37.662 --> 00:31:39.664
and I'll get you there.

679
00:31:43.601 --> 00:31:44.502
One-on-one?

680
00:31:44.503 --> 00:31:45.670
One-on-one.

681
00:31:48.239 --> 00:31:53.144
(basketball thumping)
(light upbeat music continues)

682
00:31:56.681 --> 00:31:59.550
(hoop clatters)
(basketball thumping)

683
00:32:01.319 --> 00:32:03.655
(bugs chirping)

684
00:32:04.622 --> 00:32:08.293
(sirens wailing distantly)

685
00:32:14.065 --> 00:32:16.867
(phone chimes)

686
00:32:16.868 --> 00:32:21.839
(keyboard clicking)
(cars whooshing)

687
00:32:23.908 --> 00:32:26.143
(phone ringing)

688
00:32:26.144 --> 00:32:27.911
[Andrea] Hi, you've
reached Andrea Wong.

689
00:32:27.912 --> 00:32:29.346
I'm sorry I missed your call.

690
00:32:29.347 --> 00:32:31.348
Please leave a message
at the sound of the beep.

691
00:32:31.349 --> 00:32:32.749
Thanks.

692
00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:35.920
(basketball thumping)

693
00:32:40.291 --> 00:32:41.291
See?

694
00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:47.130
(Jake chuckles)
(sirens wailing distantly)

695
00:32:47.131 --> 00:32:50.033
(basketball thumping)

696
00:32:50.034 --> 00:32:53.004
(car tires crunching)

697
00:32:54.138 --> 00:32:56.506
- That's my Dad.
- Oh.

698
00:32:56.507 --> 00:32:58.241
I'll introduce you guys.
(hoop clatters)

699
00:32:58.242 --> 00:32:59.242
Cool.

700
00:33:00.411 --> 00:33:01.712
(car door thuds)

701
00:33:01.713 --> 00:33:03.213
Hey.

702
00:33:03.214 --> 00:33:04.115
Who's this?

703
00:33:04.116 --> 00:33:05.148
This is Aleks.

704
00:33:05.149 --> 00:33:05.883
He just moved in behind us.

705
00:33:05.884 --> 00:33:07.217
Hey, Mr. Wong.

706
00:33:07.218 --> 00:33:08.186
Call me George.

707
00:33:08.187 --> 00:33:09.619
Good to meet you, Aleks.

708
00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:12.089
See you're helping
with Jake's game.

709
00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:15.859
Yeah, trying to work on his
right-handed approach 'cause,

710
00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:19.029
well, you know.
Right. (chuckles)

711
00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:20.097
Where's your mom?

712
00:33:20.098 --> 00:33:20.865
You tell me.

713
00:33:20.865 --> 00:33:21.799
Usually right behind you.

714
00:33:21.799 --> 00:33:22.667
Right.

715
00:33:22.668 --> 00:33:23.668
Maybe Janet'll know.

716
00:33:23.669 --> 00:33:25.168
She here?
Ah, no.

717
00:33:25.169 --> 00:33:27.438
She said she's, like, on a
dumpling tour or something.

718
00:33:28.539 --> 00:33:29.706
- Dumpling tour?
- [Aleks] Dumpling tour?

719
00:33:29.707 --> 00:33:31.375
Yeah, it sounded
weird when she said it,

720
00:33:31.376 --> 00:33:32.176
but I thought-
Dumpling tour?

721
00:33:32.177 --> 00:33:33.377
That sounds awesome.

722
00:33:33.378 --> 00:33:34.544
[Jake] You know what that is?

723
00:33:34.545 --> 00:33:36.413
I don't know
anything about that.

724
00:33:36.414 --> 00:33:37.447
Doesn't matter.

725
00:33:37.448 --> 00:33:38.515
I'm sure she's fine.

726
00:33:38.516 --> 00:33:39.516
Both of them.

727
00:33:43.354 --> 00:33:45.990
So, uh, you mind if I get next?

728
00:33:46.924 --> 00:33:48.959
- Uh-
- [Aleks] Sure, yeah.

729
00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.427
Yeah.

730
00:33:50.428 --> 00:33:51.428
Great.

731
00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:03.074
(basketball thumping)
Bring it.

732
00:34:14.185 --> 00:34:15.485
Aggro much?

733
00:34:15.486 --> 00:34:16.787
Calling foul, Jake?

734
00:34:16.788 --> 00:34:17.622
No.

735
00:34:17.623 --> 00:34:19.089
What's gotten into you?

736
00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:20.090
Nothing.

737
00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:24.194
Aleks, your ball.

738
00:34:24.195 --> 00:34:26.897
Okay, yeah.
(basketball thumping)

739
00:34:26.898 --> 00:34:28.166
Let's see what you got.

740
00:34:29.233 --> 00:34:34.172
(basketball thumping)
(somber music)

741
00:34:35.273 --> 00:34:36.174
Good check.

742
00:34:36.174 --> 00:34:37.174
Good check.

743
00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:44.048
(birds chirping)
(somber music continues)

744
00:34:48.986 --> 00:34:52.790
(people chattering faintly)

745
00:35:05.203 --> 00:35:06.536
[Sam] It's not like
it's gonna be forever,

746
00:35:06.537 --> 00:35:07.571
so, like, why am I worried?

747
00:35:07.572 --> 00:35:09.006
I have no idea.

748
00:35:10.475 --> 00:35:11.442
Aleks.

749
00:35:11.443 --> 00:35:12.443
- Hey, Jake.
- Hey.

750
00:35:12.443 --> 00:35:13.344
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.

751
00:35:13.344 --> 00:35:14.344
Hey, what's up?

752
00:35:24.989 --> 00:35:27.023
(locker slams)

753
00:35:27.024 --> 00:35:30.128
I can't believe she gave it
up to you, of all the people.

754
00:35:32.663 --> 00:35:33.897
(Ron chuckles)

755
00:35:33.898 --> 00:35:36.032
What the hell is your problem?

756
00:35:36.033 --> 00:35:40.004
What'd you last, like,
ten seconds? (chuckles)

757
00:35:41.973 --> 00:35:43.508
See you two on the court.

758
00:35:51.048 --> 00:35:52.884
"See you two on the court."

759
00:35:54.318 --> 00:35:57.354
Why are the hot ones
always such assholes?

760
00:35:57.355 --> 00:35:58.889
Yeah.

761
00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:00.525
Hey, you got a
charger I can borrow?

762
00:36:01.359 --> 00:36:02.359
Yeah.

763
00:36:07.899 --> 00:36:11.869
(basketballs thumping faintly)

764
00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:16.541
- Hey.
- What's up?

765
00:36:16.542 --> 00:36:17.642
What's up?

766
00:36:19.877 --> 00:36:24.815
(basketball thumping)
(players chattering)

767
00:36:29.453 --> 00:36:30.354
(whistle trills)

768
00:36:30.355 --> 00:36:31.621
All right!

769
00:36:31.622 --> 00:36:33.324
Partner up and warm up!

770
00:36:34.792 --> 00:36:36.160
Time to shine, people.

771
00:36:37.361 --> 00:36:38.361
- Hey!
- Hey.

772
00:36:39.764 --> 00:36:42.132
Listen, I've got
you, and you got this.

773
00:36:42.133 --> 00:36:43.300
Okay?

774
00:36:43.301 --> 00:36:44.834
Okay.

775
00:36:44.835 --> 00:36:46.102
- Okay?
- Okay.

776
00:36:46.103 --> 00:36:47.504
(Aleks chuckles)
(whistle trills)

777
00:36:47.505 --> 00:36:49.072
Hustle!

778
00:36:49.073 --> 00:36:50.073
Hustle!

779
00:36:50.074 --> 00:36:51.708
Hustle!
(bright upbeat music)

780
00:36:51.709 --> 00:36:56.714
Come on!
(basketballs thumping)

781
00:36:58.349 --> 00:36:59.549
(whistle trills)

782
00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:01.952
Okay, high knees, let's go.

783
00:37:01.953 --> 00:37:06.057
(sneakers squeaking
and thudding)

784
00:37:08.793 --> 00:37:11.996
(basketball thumping)

785
00:37:14.432 --> 00:37:18.269
(bright upbeat music continues)

786
00:37:20.371 --> 00:37:23.274
(basketball thumping)

787
00:37:37.288 --> 00:37:39.422
(sneakers squeaking)

788
00:37:39.423 --> 00:37:42.792
- [Player] Ooh!
- Let's do it again!

789
00:37:42.793 --> 00:37:46.630
Whoo!
(hands claps)

790
00:37:46.631 --> 00:37:50.667
(bright upbeat music continues)

791
00:37:50.668 --> 00:37:55.773
Let's see what you got.
(basketball thumping)

792
00:37:57.842 --> 00:38:00.777
[Player] Come on, get him!

793
00:38:00.778 --> 00:38:03.980
(hoop clatters)

794
00:38:03.981 --> 00:38:06.516
(whistle trills)
Divvy up into two teams,

795
00:38:06.517 --> 00:38:09.619
run a game, see who
stays and who goes.

796
00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:12.088
Let's see something!

797
00:38:12.089 --> 00:38:14.357
(upbeat music)
(basketball thumping)

798
00:38:14.358 --> 00:38:16.159
Where's the pick?

799
00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:17.227
Go!

800
00:38:17.228 --> 00:38:19.329
- No, no, no!
- [Player] Hey, hey!

801
00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:21.031
[Coach] There we go!

802
00:38:21.032 --> 00:38:24.201
(players chattering)

803
00:38:26.337 --> 00:38:31.275
(basketball thumping)
(players chattering)

804
00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:34.444
There we go.
Whoo!

805
00:38:34.445 --> 00:38:39.015
(hands clapping)
(upbeat music continues)

806
00:38:39.016 --> 00:38:40.917
[Coach] Get on him.

807
00:38:40.918 --> 00:38:44.021
(players chattering)

808
00:38:45.022 --> 00:38:46.489
[Player] Go, go!

809
00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:48.391
(players cheering)
[Coach] All right,

810
00:38:48.392 --> 00:38:53.364
there we go!
(players chattering)

811
00:38:57.501 --> 00:39:01.838
(players cheering)
(upbeat music continues)

812
00:39:01.839 --> 00:39:06.811
(players chattering)
(players cheering)

813
00:39:07.445 --> 00:39:08.445
Whoo, whoo!

814
00:39:09.914 --> 00:39:11.048
Yeah, baby!

815
00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:14.384
Yeah, I never
even saw it, right?

816
00:39:14.385 --> 00:39:18.321
So it was like sore, and
yeah, it was hilarious.

817
00:39:18.322 --> 00:39:23.026
There's this huge scar...
(people chattering)

818
00:39:23.027 --> 00:39:24.795
Playing with the
new kid paid off.

819
00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:28.298
(locker rattling)

820
00:39:28.299 --> 00:39:30.900
You know, just be careful
he doesn't give you any gay.

821
00:39:30.901 --> 00:39:34.939
Otherwise, Val might find
bigger and better things.

822
00:39:37.641 --> 00:39:39.042
(Ron moans)

823
00:39:39.043 --> 00:39:40.043
Oh God, are you
miming yourself

824
00:39:40.044 --> 00:39:42.011
getting a blow job from Valerie?

825
00:39:42.012 --> 00:39:44.914
'Cause that's masturbatory,
creepy, and I'm gonna tell her.

826
00:39:44.915 --> 00:39:46.583
(scoffs) Whatever.

827
00:39:46.584 --> 00:39:49.486
You know, Val deserves better
than you, Jakey Two-inch.

828
00:39:49.487 --> 00:39:50.854
Lay off him, Ronald.

829
00:39:50.855 --> 00:39:54.023
How is he getting laid?

830
00:39:54.024 --> 00:39:55.092
By her?

831
00:39:57.561 --> 00:39:59.697
Wait, he didn't tell you two?

832
00:40:00.498 --> 00:40:02.298
(chuckles) Yeah.

833
00:40:02.299 --> 00:40:03.833
Jake is finally a man now.

834
00:40:03.834 --> 00:40:05.468
Check the Gram.

835
00:40:05.469 --> 00:40:06.937
Dude, is that true?

836
00:40:08.038 --> 00:40:09.105
She caved?

837
00:40:09.106 --> 00:40:10.473
Who cares?

838
00:40:10.474 --> 00:40:11.908
It was probably so bad,
it'll never happen again.

839
00:40:11.909 --> 00:40:13.510
(locker slams)
You are such an asshole!

840
00:40:13.511 --> 00:40:14.378
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

841
00:40:14.379 --> 00:40:15.779
Yeah, no one likes you.

842
00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:16.946
And we only put up with you
because you're the captain

843
00:40:16.947 --> 00:40:19.382
and, until now, our best player.

844
00:40:19.383 --> 00:40:22.719
And no, no, Aleks
didn't give me any gay.

845
00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:25.255
That's not how it
works, you caveman.

846
00:40:25.256 --> 00:40:30.093
Me thinks the jock
doth protests too much.

847
00:40:30.094 --> 00:40:31.728
The hell does that mean?

848
00:40:31.729 --> 00:40:33.229
It means for a straight guy,

849
00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:35.599
you're a little too obsessed
with Jake's virginity.

850
00:40:37.401 --> 00:40:39.035
I'm not gay, you dick!

851
00:40:39.036 --> 00:40:41.138
I'm pissed that he
got Valerie's V-card!

852
00:40:44.041 --> 00:40:48.979
Are you sure about that?
(low soft music)

853
00:40:54.919 --> 00:40:56.219
Huh?

854
00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:58.888
- Look at this guy.
- [Player] (chuckles) Nice.

855
00:40:58.889 --> 00:41:03.226
(player whoops)
(player whistles)

856
00:41:03.227 --> 00:41:04.427
(player howls)

857
00:41:04.428 --> 00:41:09.400
(players laughing)
(players cheering)

858
00:41:13.003 --> 00:41:15.306
- Get a room!
- [Player] Whoo!

859
00:41:16.874 --> 00:41:18.375
Whoo!
[Player] Yeah!

860
00:41:18.509 --> 00:41:21.177
If you're still not hard,
you should see a dick doctor.

861
00:41:21.178 --> 00:41:22.779
Back off!

862
00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:25.049
You, you fucking fa-
What?

863
00:41:28.352 --> 00:41:29.853
Yeah.

864
00:41:29.854 --> 00:41:31.789
That's what I thought.

865
00:41:34.525 --> 00:41:36.060
Hope you all enjoyed the show.

866
00:41:37.628 --> 00:41:38.863
If I make the team,

867
00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:42.699
there's plenty more
where that came from.

868
00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:43.700
Boys.

869
00:41:45.436 --> 00:41:47.837
(phone chimes)

870
00:41:47.838 --> 00:41:49.272
Hey, man.

871
00:41:49.273 --> 00:41:50.707
- Hey.
- You okay?

872
00:41:50.708 --> 00:41:53.509
Yeah.
(phone chimes)

873
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:54.978
- Is it true about Valerie?
- (scoffs) No, man.

874
00:41:54.979 --> 00:41:56.312
Come on, I told you.

875
00:41:56.313 --> 00:41:57.753
She's waiting for
marriage, remember?

876
00:41:58.749 --> 00:42:00.951
Yeah, yeah.

877
00:42:02.953 --> 00:42:05.021
(locker rattles)

878
00:42:05.022 --> 00:42:10.027
(phone chimes)
Oh shit.

879
00:42:10.628 --> 00:42:13.163
(locker slams)

880
00:42:18.702 --> 00:42:20.670
Shit.

881
00:42:20.671 --> 00:42:23.473
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

882
00:42:23.474 --> 00:42:25.141
(sighs) Okay, okay, um...

883
00:42:25.142 --> 00:42:26.676
Only a few dozen
likes, thank God.

884
00:42:26.677 --> 00:42:28.978
No one super gossipy saw it
or, you know, our parents.

885
00:42:28.979 --> 00:42:31.481
How could you be
so careless, Vee?

886
00:42:31.482 --> 00:42:32.649
It was an accident.

887
00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:34.083
I didn't see the wrapper.

888
00:42:34.084 --> 00:42:35.685
I was just trying to
commemorate our special night.

889
00:42:35.686 --> 00:42:37.687
You know, like a little
secret between you and me.

890
00:42:37.688 --> 00:42:38.923
I didn't mean to out us.

891
00:42:40.324 --> 00:42:41.524
Besides, why do you even care?

892
00:42:41.525 --> 00:42:42.493
You're a guy.

893
00:42:42.494 --> 00:42:43.726
If this had gotten out,

894
00:42:43.727 --> 00:42:45.328
you've be getting high-fives
all around school.

895
00:42:45.329 --> 00:42:47.409
What do you think people
would've said about me, hmm?

896
00:42:52.836 --> 00:42:53.804
Fuck.

897
00:42:53.805 --> 00:42:55.405
Okay, yeah.

898
00:42:55.406 --> 00:42:56.307
You're right.

899
00:42:56.307 --> 00:42:57.307
I'm sorry, I just,

900
00:42:58.542 --> 00:43:01.011
I just can't... (sighs)

901
00:43:02.846 --> 00:43:04.147
It just freaked me out

902
00:43:04.148 --> 00:43:05.668
to have that choice
taken away from me.

903
00:43:07.117 --> 00:43:09.086
Our choice, from us.

904
00:43:11.989 --> 00:43:13.023
Do you regret it?

905
00:43:13.891 --> 00:43:14.891
Of course not.

906
00:43:22.232 --> 00:43:24.667
Why don't we put
out a different story?

907
00:43:24.668 --> 00:43:25.935
What do you mean?

908
00:43:25.936 --> 00:43:28.705
Like, um, we'll erase
the old one, and uh,

909
00:43:28.706 --> 00:43:31.641
and then we'll find something
new that'll distract everyone.

910
00:43:31.642 --> 00:43:33.042
(phone chimes)
(upbeat music)

911
00:43:33.043 --> 00:43:36.212
Hey, Robogram, here is a special
episode of J-pop and Vee.

912
00:43:36.213 --> 00:43:37.147
Where are we going, babe?

913
00:43:37.147 --> 00:43:38.115
Where it all began!

914
00:43:38.116 --> 00:43:40.016
Whoo!
(Vee laughs)

915
00:43:40.017 --> 00:43:41.684
It's time for...
(dog barking)

916
00:43:41.685 --> 00:43:43.886
J-Pop and Vee origins!

917
00:43:43.887 --> 00:43:46.723
Once upon a time, there was
an eight-year-old J-Pop,

918
00:43:46.724 --> 00:43:50.159
and he got this plastic
ring from the dentist.

919
00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:52.095
(bell dings)
(hearts bubbling)

920
00:43:52.096 --> 00:43:54.964
And he crushed hard
on his classmate Vee.

921
00:43:54.965 --> 00:43:58.534
Then, at this very park, he
saw his big shot. (gasps)

922
00:43:58.535 --> 00:44:03.340
He, yeah, got down on both
knees, and he proposed.

923
00:44:04.575 --> 00:44:05.675
Both knees.

924
00:44:05.676 --> 00:44:07.010
What a gentleman.

925
00:44:07.011 --> 00:44:09.146
We got married at recess
under the monkey bars.

926
00:44:10.014 --> 00:44:11.180
[Both] I'm all yours.

927
00:44:11.181 --> 00:44:11.849
Forever.

928
00:44:11.849 --> 00:44:12.849
Promise.

929
00:44:14.351 --> 00:44:15.651
We broke up the next day.

930
00:44:15.652 --> 00:44:17.253
Well, marriage is
a big deal for a kid.

931
00:44:17.254 --> 00:44:18.755
(laughs) We finally
made it real and official

932
00:44:18.756 --> 00:44:21.858
when he asked me out on this
very spot just two years ago.

933
00:44:21.859 --> 00:44:22.893
Two.

934
00:44:24.928 --> 00:44:27.663
(Jake puffs)
(hearts bubbling)

935
00:44:27.664 --> 00:44:29.066
I think it worked.

936
00:44:29.199 --> 00:44:30.700
No one's talking about that
other post except for Ronald.

937
00:44:30.701 --> 00:44:33.370
And thankfully, he's too stupid
to have screen grabbed it.

938
00:44:35.406 --> 00:44:40.377
(basketball thumping)
(phone clicks)

939
00:44:45.449 --> 00:44:46.449
What's wrong?

940
00:44:47.885 --> 00:44:49.919
Uh, nothing.

941
00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:52.155
I'm just, I guess I'm just tired

942
00:44:52.156 --> 00:44:54.091
with the training
and then the tryouts.

943
00:44:57.027 --> 00:44:58.294
(scoffs) What?

944
00:44:58.295 --> 00:44:59.729
(stammers) I can't
like basketball now?

945
00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:02.532
I thought you're just
doing it for your dad.

946
00:45:02.533 --> 00:45:03.866
Uh, I don't know.

947
00:45:03.867 --> 00:45:06.003
Yeah, maybe I'm just growing
to like something new.

948
00:45:08.806 --> 00:45:10.340
You over photography now?

949
00:45:11.708 --> 00:45:12.708
Maybe.

950
00:45:14.344 --> 00:45:16.779
You haven't finished
your school application?

951
00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:18.314
It's September.

952
00:45:18.315 --> 00:45:19.782
Yeah, but school deadlines
are like really soon.

953
00:45:19.783 --> 00:45:21.117
Do you need a push in
the right direction here?

954
00:45:21.118 --> 00:45:22.486
No, I'll get it done, okay?

955
00:45:24.521 --> 00:45:25.521
Okay.

956
00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:28.425
You get bored of
shooting me, too?

957
00:45:29.493 --> 00:45:30.493
No!

958
00:45:31.662 --> 00:45:34.565
(sighs) Vee, the lens is
still broken, that's...

959
00:45:35.632 --> 00:45:36.632
That's why.

960
00:45:42.306 --> 00:45:45.042
You're the only
one I care about.

961
00:45:51.982 --> 00:45:52.982
I'm all yours.

962
00:45:54.518 --> 00:45:55.518
Forever.

963
00:45:57.988 --> 00:45:58.988
I promise.

964
00:46:03.293 --> 00:46:06.463
(bright somber music)

965
00:46:14.304 --> 00:46:15.305
[Sam] What's the word?

966
00:46:17.074 --> 00:46:18.141
I made it.

967
00:46:18.142 --> 00:46:19.308
You made it?

968
00:46:19.309 --> 00:46:20.510
I made it!
(hand claps)

969
00:46:20.511 --> 00:46:22.012
- You made it, yo!
- Finally, dude!

970
00:46:25.215 --> 00:46:29.953
Dude, we're on the team!
(all cheering)

971
00:46:31.321 --> 00:46:32.588
We are gonna dominate.

972
00:46:32.589 --> 00:46:34.358
Boys, let us celebrate.
Come on!

973
00:46:36.126 --> 00:46:37.527
Jake, come on!

974
00:46:37.528 --> 00:46:38.528
Whoo!

975
00:46:39.229 --> 00:46:42.231
(laughs) Whoo!

976
00:46:42.232 --> 00:46:45.768
(bright somber music continues)

977
00:46:45.769 --> 00:46:48.372
(Jake grunting)

978
00:47:24.274 --> 00:47:25.441
(door knocks)
[George] Jake,

979
00:47:25.442 --> 00:47:26.976
can I come in?
Yeah, just a second.

980
00:47:26.977 --> 00:47:28.444
Dad, what the-
Ooh.

981
00:47:28.445 --> 00:47:29.478
Hey!

982
00:47:29.479 --> 00:47:30.147
Aren't you supposed
to be at work?

983
00:47:30.147 --> 00:47:31.147
Come here.

984
00:47:32.683 --> 00:47:34.717
I'm on the way out, but I
wanted to wish you luck today.

985
00:47:34.718 --> 00:47:35.718
It's your first game!

986
00:47:36.987 --> 00:47:38.454
Yeah.

987
00:47:38.455 --> 00:47:40.256
Yeah, it's no big deal.

988
00:47:40.257 --> 00:47:41.225
Yeah, it is, man.

989
00:47:41.226 --> 00:47:42.426
It's a big deal.

990
00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:44.961
We worked hard for this.

991
00:47:44.962 --> 00:47:46.395
I'm proud of you.

992
00:47:46.396 --> 00:47:47.530
Okay?

993
00:47:47.531 --> 00:47:48.531
Okay.

994
00:47:49.166 --> 00:47:50.933
Good luck today.

995
00:47:50.934 --> 00:47:52.668
Put some clothes on.

996
00:47:52.669 --> 00:47:54.037
Don't barge in.

997
00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:59.376
(door thuds)

998
00:48:01.278 --> 00:48:06.283
(soft hopeful music)
(Jake sighs)

999
00:48:11.088 --> 00:48:13.522
(bell ringing)

1000
00:48:13.523 --> 00:48:18.462
(locker rattles)
(students chattering)

1001
00:48:34.244 --> 00:48:37.147
(low tense music)

1002
00:48:50.227 --> 00:48:52.828
(Jake sighs)

1003
00:48:52.829 --> 00:48:54.597
- All right.
- Yeah, I mean, that's...

1004
00:48:54.598 --> 00:48:56.232
You gotta do it.

1005
00:48:56.233 --> 00:48:57.367
Whoo, whoo!

1006
00:48:59.303 --> 00:49:00.137
[Player] I'm gonna jump today.

1007
00:49:00.138 --> 00:49:01.337
Low gravity day.

1008
00:49:01.338 --> 00:49:02.139
- Do it.
- Yeah.

1009
00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:03.506
Do it.

1010
00:49:03.507 --> 00:49:04.674
But you gotta tie
your shoes first, man.

1011
00:49:04.675 --> 00:49:05.708
Those are fucking
ankle-breaking.

1012
00:49:05.709 --> 00:49:07.877
Tipoff in 20 minutes, boys.

1013
00:49:07.878 --> 00:49:09.011
Do the school proud.

1014
00:49:09.012 --> 00:49:11.847
- All right, Coach.
- Let's do it, Coach.

1015
00:49:11.848 --> 00:49:16.787
(Jake breathing shakily)
(players chattering)

1016
00:49:20.824 --> 00:49:21.692
Hey!

1017
00:49:21.693 --> 00:49:23.059
Hey.

1018
00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:24.393
You okay?

1019
00:49:24.394 --> 00:49:26.129
Uh, I don't know,
I feel kinda sick.

1020
00:49:28.565 --> 00:49:29.765
You're clammy as
fuck. (chuckles)

1021
00:49:29.766 --> 00:49:31.468
Dude, I've never
played before.

1022
00:49:32.402 --> 00:49:33.903
Want some water or something?

1023
00:49:33.904 --> 00:49:35.338
Aw!

1024
00:49:35.339 --> 00:49:37.673
The back alley boys
are having a moment.

1025
00:49:37.674 --> 00:49:39.041
How sweet.

1026
00:49:39.042 --> 00:49:40.409
Screw you, Ronald.

1027
00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:41.778
Yeah, I bet you'd like to.

1028
00:49:44.081 --> 00:49:45.381
(Ron moans)

1029
00:49:45.382 --> 00:49:46.616
Does that do it for you?

1030
00:49:48.352 --> 00:49:49.352
For God's sake, Ronald,

1031
00:49:49.353 --> 00:49:50.419
we're about to get on the court.

1032
00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:51.887
You're our team captain, man.

1033
00:49:51.888 --> 00:49:52.888
Act like it.

1034
00:49:53.557 --> 00:49:55.225
Why'd you join
the team, Aleks?

1035
00:49:57.127 --> 00:50:01.398
You just wanted to see more
D, didn't you? (laughs)

1036
00:50:04.635 --> 00:50:07.937
(tense music)
(Jake grunts)

1037
00:50:07.938 --> 00:50:09.505
Don't call us that.

1038
00:50:09.506 --> 00:50:11.540
(blow thuds)
(Jake grunts)

1039
00:50:11.541 --> 00:50:16.546
(locker rattles)
(blow thuds)

1040
00:50:18.348 --> 00:50:23.320
(blows thudding)
(tense music continues)
