WEBVTT

1
00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:39.891
Oh.

2
00:01:43.562 --> 00:01:45.814
Oh, my gosh.

3
00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:37.986
What's going on?

4
00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:40.363
No time to explain. Run away.

5
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.995
Oh, hey, Sammy.

6
00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:49.039
You really got those moves
locked down now, hmm?

7
00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:50.665
I sure do, Mr. Moon.

8
00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:53.376
Yeah, look at you.

9
00:04:53.502 --> 00:04:55.754
Great job, everybody. Great job.

10
00:04:55.837 --> 00:04:58.006
- Thanks, Mr. Moon.
- Yeah!

11
00:04:58.089 --> 00:05:00.258
I think we pretty much nailed it.

12
00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:01.383
So, is she here?

13
00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:06.014
There. See the dog, middle third row?

14
00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:07.933
Oh, she's younger
than I imagined.

15
00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:10.644
Well, supposedly,
she's the best scout in show business.

16
00:05:10.727 --> 00:05:12.687
I can't tell if... if she's enjoying it.

17
00:05:12.771 --> 00:05:14.189
Come on, let's get a better view.

18
00:05:28.078 --> 00:05:30.205
And how we doing over here, Miss Crawly?

19
00:05:30.288 --> 00:05:32.040
Oh, very good, Mr. Moon.

20
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.751
So far, I counted nine smiles,

21
00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:37.504
two belly laughs and five chuckles.

22
00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:40.590
Uh, though the last one
could've just been gas.

23
00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:42.759
Well, that's proof, right?
She must like the show.

24
00:05:42.842 --> 00:05:44.553
- Oh, my gosh. You think so?
- I hope so.

25
00:05:44.636 --> 00:05:46.221
All right, now,
keep up the good work.

26
00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:47.931
Come on, everybody, back to positions.

27
00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:49.766
She'd be cuckoo
not to love this.

28
00:05:49.891 --> 00:05:52.519
Dream big dreams.

29
00:05:52.644 --> 00:05:54.187
That's what I always said, right?

30
00:05:54.312 --> 00:05:55.438
Mm-hmm.

31
00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:57.607
Well, looks like we're about
to take this show

32
00:05:57.691 --> 00:06:00.318
to the entertainment capital of the world.

33
00:06:00.443 --> 00:06:02.612
Mr. Moon, she's leaving.

34
00:06:02.737 --> 00:06:04.698
- Huh?
- She's leaving the show.

35
00:06:07.576 --> 00:06:09.536
Miss Crawly, stay right here.

36
00:06:09.661 --> 00:06:11.871
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna follow that dog.

37
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.795
Good heavens!

38
00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:20.463
- Hey, Nana.
- What are you doing?

39
00:06:20.547 --> 00:06:21.756
The scout is leaving.

40
00:06:23.174 --> 00:06:24.843
Ah, so she is.

41
00:06:25.343 --> 00:06:26.386
Hurry.

42
00:06:30.974 --> 00:06:32.809
Uh, Suki? Suki Lane?

43
00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:34.603
I'm Buster Moon.

44
00:06:34.686 --> 00:06:36.438
Uh, hi. So glad you could make it.

45
00:06:36.521 --> 00:06:37.772
Would you like some popcorn?

46
00:06:37.856 --> 00:06:40.775
Oh, no, thanks.
I'm not staying for the second half, so...

47
00:06:40.859 --> 00:06:42.611
Oh. But we thought
you were enjoying it.

48
00:06:42.694 --> 00:06:44.863
I mean, not that we were
watching you or anything.

49
00:06:44.946 --> 00:06:47.907
It really is a cute little show.

50
00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:49.492
Just not what we're looking for.

51
00:06:49.576 --> 00:06:51.620
But... but wait.
You got to see the second act.

52
00:06:51.703 --> 00:06:53.705
I'm... I'm telling you.
It's a smash.

53
00:06:53.788 --> 00:06:55.874
- Okay, Mr. Moon, can I be honest?
- Of course.

54
00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:58.793
Are you sure? 'Cause folks say that
when they don't mean it.

55
00:06:58.877 --> 00:07:00.962
No, please, please,
be as honest as you like.

56
00:07:01.046 --> 00:07:02.714
You're not good enough.

57
00:07:02.797 --> 00:07:04.007
What?

58
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.508
Taxi!

59
00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:07.844
You know, maybe I will have that popcorn.

60
00:07:09.387 --> 00:07:12.098
Look, you've got a nice
little local theater here,

61
00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:14.351
and it's great for what it is,

62
00:07:14.476 --> 00:07:17.437
but trust me, you'd never make it
in the big leagues.

63
00:07:17.896 --> 00:07:18.980
Bye, now.

64
00:07:23.944 --> 00:07:26.529
Well, what did she say?

65
00:07:27.113 --> 00:07:28.198
I'll be right back.

66
00:07:29.074 --> 00:07:31.034
Nah. Mm-mm.

67
00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:33.078
A few laughs, bunch of quirky ideas.

68
00:07:33.203 --> 00:07:35.830
But, anyway, about Thursday...

69
00:07:36.373 --> 00:07:38.041
Oh, my...

70
00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:39.793
Yeah, hi. It's me again.

71
00:07:39.876 --> 00:07:41.836
Whoa.

72
00:07:42.003 --> 00:07:43.463
- Whoa.
- I'll call you back.

73
00:07:44.923 --> 00:07:46.299
Are you out of your mind?

74
00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:47.717
When are you holding auditions?

75
00:07:47.842 --> 00:07:49.386
Tomorrow.

76
00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:51.054
- There's no way you...
- Listen...

77
00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:53.556
Get out of the road, you idiot!

78
00:07:53.682 --> 00:07:55.809
Hey, do you mind?
I'm in a meeting here.

79
00:07:55.934 --> 00:07:58.520
Could you at least give us a chance
to try out for your boss?

80
00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:00.981
Driver, could you please
lose this maniac?

81
00:08:01.064 --> 00:08:02.232
Wait. Hold on a second.

82
00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:03.650
No, no!

83
00:09:14.137 --> 00:09:15.513
Mr. Moon?

84
00:09:40.872 --> 00:09:42.665
Oh, for heaven's sake.

85
00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:46.586
What can I say, Nana?

86
00:09:46.669 --> 00:09:48.922
- I'm a failure.
- Oh, poppycock.

87
00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:50.423
I was reaching too high.

88
00:09:50.632 --> 00:09:54.677
Honestly, one negative comment,
and it's all, "Woe is me."

89
00:09:54.761 --> 00:09:57.055
Nana, come on.
She said I'm not good enough.

90
00:09:57.138 --> 00:10:00.058
I mean, heck,
I've just been told that my destiny,

91
00:10:00.141 --> 00:10:03.269
all of my hopes and dreams,
uh, they all end right here.

92
00:10:03.353 --> 00:10:04.687
Well, what did you expect?

93
00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:07.649
That she would drop to her knees
and declare you a genius?

94
00:10:07.732 --> 00:10:10.944
Roll out the red carpet
for the great Buster Moon!

95
00:10:11.152 --> 00:10:13.071
She... she ran me off the road
into a canal.

96
00:10:13.196 --> 00:10:15.740
- You're still in one piece, aren't you?
- Well, yeah, but...

97
00:10:15.907 --> 00:10:18.952
Well, anyone who dares set out
to follow their dreams

98
00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.664
is bound to face a lot worse
than a dip in the canal.

99
00:10:23.081 --> 00:10:24.624
Ah, Hobbs. I found him.

100
00:10:24.749 --> 00:10:26.459
Uh, bring the car round, will you?

101
00:10:26.543 --> 00:10:27.961
- There's a good chap.
- I... I...

102
00:10:28.044 --> 00:10:30.380
I just thought she'd at least
see we deserved a shot.

103
00:10:30.505 --> 00:10:33.216
Never mind what this person
you don't even know said.

104
00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:35.760
- Do you think you're good enough?
- Of course, but...

105
00:10:35.844 --> 00:10:37.887
Then you must fight
for what you believe in.

106
00:10:38.012 --> 00:10:40.390
Guts, stamina, faith.

107
00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:43.935
These are the things you need now,
and without them...

108
00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:46.563
Well, maybe that scout was right.

109
00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:49.274
Maybe you're not good enough.

110
00:11:33.318 --> 00:11:35.945
Oh, I... No, I know, Rosita,
but trust me on this.

111
00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:37.405
It'll be totally worth it.

112
00:11:37.488 --> 00:11:39.240
And listen,
I'm outside her place now,

113
00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:41.910
can you call the others
and have 'em meet in half an hour?

114
00:11:42.285 --> 00:11:43.620
Great. Thank you.

115
00:12:18.154 --> 00:12:19.530
Thank you so much.

116
00:12:19.948 --> 00:12:20.948
Good night.

117
00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:25.244
Moon. Hey.

118
00:12:26.996 --> 00:12:28.998
Wow.
You were great out there.

119
00:12:29.082 --> 00:12:31.000
- I got to go back out for an encore.
- Okay.

120
00:12:31.084 --> 00:12:33.294
- What are you doing after the show?
- Uh, nothing.

121
00:12:33.503 --> 00:12:35.380
Listen, I know this is
crazy short notice,

122
00:12:35.463 --> 00:12:37.298
but you always said
you'd come back to us

123
00:12:37.423 --> 00:12:38.943
- when the time was right.
- Of course.

124
00:12:39.092 --> 00:12:41.469
Well, this is that time.

125
00:12:41.594 --> 00:12:42.971
Here, paycheck.

126
00:12:43.054 --> 00:12:44.973
I'm getting the gang together
to go audition

127
00:12:45.056 --> 00:12:46.936
- for this huge show...
- Just... just a second.

128
00:12:46.975 --> 00:12:49.185
Hey, Rick, how come
you're only paying me

129
00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:50.561
half what the other acts get?

130
00:12:50.728 --> 00:12:52.772
- I pay what I think you're worth.
- Oh, okay.

131
00:12:53.314 --> 00:12:58.194
See, I have this rule about not letting
guys like you tell me what I'm worth,

132
00:12:58.277 --> 00:13:01.781
so, you know, unless I get paid
like everyone else, I'm out of here.

133
00:13:01.864 --> 00:13:03.825
This is the only club in town.

134
00:13:03.908 --> 00:13:05.076
Where else you gonna play?

135
00:13:05.159 --> 00:13:08.621
I have no idea, but I'm sure as heck
not sticking around here.

136
00:13:08.746 --> 00:13:09.831
Let's go.

137
00:13:09.914 --> 00:13:10.957
Ooh!

138
00:13:11.165 --> 00:13:14.168
Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.
You... you got to do the encore.

139
00:13:14.293 --> 00:13:15.670
Hey, Ash!

140
00:13:15.753 --> 00:13:17.338
Deal with it, sweetheart.

141
00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:20.425
<i>Redshore City Bus five</i>

142
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:22.760
<i>leaving from park 15...</i>

143
00:13:22.885 --> 00:13:24.595
Okay, I got the tickets.

144
00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:26.973
Anyone seen Miss Crawly?
Here you go, Johnny.

145
00:13:27.056 --> 00:13:28.367
- Here's yours, and...
- Mr. Moon.

146
00:13:28.391 --> 00:13:32.311
Uh, uh, I'm sorry, but I'm really having
second thoughts about this.

147
00:13:32.729 --> 00:13:34.439
What? No, no, no, wait.

148
00:13:34.605 --> 00:13:36.399
All right, last call. Let's go.

149
00:13:36.482 --> 00:13:38.401
- Now, just a second.
- Johnny's right.

150
00:13:38.609 --> 00:13:41.946
I mean, that theater scout,
she didn't think we were good enough.

151
00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:44.032
- She sounds like a jerk.
- Yeah, total jerk.

152
00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.367
Yeah, but she's wrong... Dead wrong.

153
00:13:46.451 --> 00:13:49.078
There's a reason our show
is sold out every night,

154
00:13:49.412 --> 00:13:51.581
and I'm telling you,
her boss is gonna love it.

155
00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:55.168
Ooh. Or maybe we could just, like,
do a different show, you know?

156
00:13:55.251 --> 00:13:56.711
Gunter, please, I got this.

157
00:13:56.794 --> 00:14:00.048
Seriously, I have this idea
for, like, a space musical.

158
00:14:00.131 --> 00:14:02.800
All right, we're rolling out here.

159
00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:05.344
You don't want to hear
about the space musical?

160
00:14:05.428 --> 00:14:07.513
Guys, come on!

161
00:14:07.889 --> 00:14:09.098
Wait!

162
00:14:17.523 --> 00:14:19.067
Listen, you guys,

163
00:14:19.275 --> 00:14:23.905
I have dreamt of performing
in Redshore City since I was a little kid.

164
00:14:23.988 --> 00:14:26.157
And besides,
I just convinced my husband

165
00:14:26.282 --> 00:14:28.201
to babysit for the next 24 hours,

166
00:14:28.326 --> 00:14:31.079
and I am not gonna waste
an opportunity like that.

167
00:14:31.204 --> 00:14:33.706
So come on.
We've got nothing to lose.

168
00:14:36.542 --> 00:14:38.836
Here, Ash.
You come in on page two.

169
00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.671
Wait. We're just gonna
rehearse this here

170
00:14:40.755 --> 00:14:42.632
- at the back of the bus?
- We are.

171
00:14:42.757 --> 00:14:44.759
- Course we are.
- Yep.

172
00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:47.011
We got to get this show
in the best shape ever.

173
00:14:47.136 --> 00:14:48.805
Ah, Miss Crawly, you made it. Good.

174
00:14:49.013 --> 00:14:51.557
You are an angel, and we're
sure gonna need that...

175
00:14:51.641 --> 00:14:52.850
Whoa!

176
00:14:53.017 --> 00:14:54.102
What the...

177
00:14:54.477 --> 00:14:58.523
Uh, well, you did say, "Dress to impress."

178
00:15:53.828 --> 00:15:57.206
Let's cut that and have you play
the guitar part through the whole scene.

179
00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:59.959
- Got it.
- Guys, we're here.

180
00:16:29.697 --> 00:16:33.284
All right. Let's go spread
a little Moon Theater magic.

181
00:16:34.827 --> 00:16:36.204
- Woo-hoo!
- Come on!

182
00:16:39.874 --> 00:16:40.875
No.

183
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.543
No? What do you mean, "no"?

184
00:16:42.627 --> 00:16:45.421
For the last time, sir,
no appointment, no entry.

185
00:16:45.505 --> 00:16:47.173
- Um...
- Sir, do I need to call security?

186
00:16:47.256 --> 00:16:49.050
- We should go.
- You should.

187
00:16:49.133 --> 00:16:50.259
Next.

188
00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:53.346
- I don't like this.
- How may I help you?

189
00:16:53.429 --> 00:16:54.764
I'm here to see Mr. Crystal...

190
00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:55.973
This is so unfair.

191
00:16:56.057 --> 00:16:58.351
She's, like, totally unfair, that lady.

192
00:16:58.434 --> 00:17:00.811
I mean, why's she got
to be so snotty about it?

193
00:17:00.895 --> 00:17:02.897
I got all dressed up for nothing.

194
00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:05.274
Let's find somewhere
for lunch and hang out.

195
00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:07.860
In here. Quick. Get in.

196
00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:11.780
Hmm.

197
00:17:11.864 --> 00:17:13.032
- Come on.
- So dark in here.

198
00:17:13.115 --> 00:17:14.909
- What's going on?
- I got to think.

199
00:17:15.076 --> 00:17:17.370
Mr. Moon? I'm not so good in small spaces.

200
00:17:17.662 --> 00:17:20.122
- Okay, okay.
- Ow! Somebody stepped on my trotter.

201
00:17:20.206 --> 00:17:21.374
- Sorry.
- Honey. Come on.

202
00:17:21.457 --> 00:17:23.501
- Let's get you out of here.
- Aha!

203
00:17:23.584 --> 00:17:24.752
Look at this.

204
00:17:24.835 --> 00:17:25.920
Meena.

205
00:17:26.003 --> 00:17:27.964
Do you think that's kind of your size?

206
00:17:47.733 --> 00:17:48.776
Hey, Ricky.

207
00:17:49.485 --> 00:17:52.196
Hi.

208
00:17:58.828 --> 00:18:00.204
Crystal Entertainment.

209
00:18:00.288 --> 00:18:02.248
- Uh, hold one moment, sir.
- Phew.

210
00:18:02.331 --> 00:18:04.166
- I'll... I'll connect you.
- Oh, no.

211
00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:06.544
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Everybody, hold on.

212
00:18:09.463 --> 00:18:11.382
- Mr. Moon?
- Hold tight, Miss Crawly.

213
00:18:23.603 --> 00:18:24.645
Good job.

214
00:18:24.729 --> 00:18:26.480
Now, into the elevator.

215
00:18:26.564 --> 00:18:28.149
Quick. Go, go, go, go.

216
00:18:29.025 --> 00:18:30.151
Meena! Come on!

217
00:18:36.782 --> 00:18:38.909
We could all get arrested for...

218
00:18:57.887 --> 00:18:59.388
Everybody, mop.

219
00:19:08.356 --> 00:19:10.358
Uh...

220
00:19:36.967 --> 00:19:38.177
Where are you going now?

221
00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.888
I'm gonna find somewhere to change
out of this stuff.

222
00:19:42.848 --> 00:19:43.848
Ah.

223
00:20:12.545 --> 00:20:14.171
Look, that's him.

224
00:20:14.255 --> 00:20:16.298
That is the Mr. Crystal.

225
00:20:17.967 --> 00:20:19.593
Garbage.

226
00:21:55.481 --> 00:21:57.233
Okay, everybody,

227
00:21:57.316 --> 00:21:59.902
if you can leave immediately,
single file,

228
00:21:59.985 --> 00:22:01.862
we'd appreciate that.

229
00:22:01.946 --> 00:22:03.239
Thank you very much.

230
00:22:03.656 --> 00:22:05.157
Jerry, for the love of...

231
00:22:05.241 --> 00:22:07.368
- Sorry, sir.
- Where's the next group?

232
00:22:07.451 --> 00:22:10.329
- Why am I standing here waiting?
- How about I just...

233
00:22:10.412 --> 00:22:12.873
- Be useful or be gone, okay?
- Yes. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

234
00:22:12.957 --> 00:22:14.708
Um, okay. Um, you.

235
00:22:15.334 --> 00:22:18.462
Hey. Hey. Yeah, you.
Little guy, you're here for the audition?

236
00:22:18.587 --> 00:22:20.172
Uh, yes.

237
00:22:20.256 --> 00:22:22.007
Yeah, yeah, yes, we are.

238
00:22:22.258 --> 00:22:23.843
Guys, we're on right now.

239
00:22:23.968 --> 00:22:24.969
- Now?
- What?

240
00:22:27.555 --> 00:22:29.431
Your name? Your name, please?

241
00:22:30.057 --> 00:22:32.393
<i>Uh, it's Buster Moon
from the New Moon Theater.</i>

242
00:22:32.518 --> 00:22:36.021
<i>And we're very excited to share
our story with you today. Right, guys?</i>

243
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:37.898
Yeah, great. Now, get to it.

244
00:22:37.982 --> 00:22:38.983
<i>Of course. Yes.</i>

245
00:22:39.066 --> 00:22:40.484
Guys, just like we rehearsed.

246
00:22:44.405 --> 00:22:45.573
<i>This is the story</i>

247
00:22:45.656 --> 00:22:47.950
<i>of an ordinary high school girl
who discovers...</i>

248
00:22:48.367 --> 00:22:49.660
Stop.

249
00:22:49.743 --> 00:22:51.412
<i>- Stop?</i>
- He wants you to stop.

250
00:22:52.621 --> 00:22:54.623
"Ordinary" and "school."

251
00:22:54.707 --> 00:22:56.667
Two words I will never
be associated with.

252
00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:58.127
- Never.
- Where the heck did you

253
00:22:58.210 --> 00:22:59.336
dig these guys up from?

254
00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:01.964
If you could all leave quickly,
we'd appreciate that.

255
00:23:02.047 --> 00:23:03.632
I need big shows, Jerry.

256
00:23:03.716 --> 00:23:05.759
- Big ideas!
- Yes, sir, big. The biggest.

257
00:23:05.843 --> 00:23:07.636
Hey, I have a big one.

258
00:23:09.179 --> 00:23:11.056
Okay, honey. Come on, let's go.

259
00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:12.558
You know, the sci-fi musical.

260
00:23:12.641 --> 00:23:14.018
- That's big, right?
- Um, uh...

261
00:23:14.101 --> 00:23:16.895
I mean, it's got
the aliens and the robots

262
00:23:16.979 --> 00:23:19.607
and the lasers
and these amazing songs

263
00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:21.275
from, like, Clay Calloway to...

264
00:23:21.358 --> 00:23:23.736
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Clay Calloway?

265
00:23:23.861 --> 00:23:25.446
I love Clay Calloway.

266
00:23:25.946 --> 00:23:28.657
<i>I know, right?
I mean, doesn't everybody?</i>

267
00:23:28.741 --> 00:23:30.075
Yeah. See, Jerry?

268
00:23:30.159 --> 00:23:33.412
This is exactly the kind
of big idea I'm talking about.

269
00:23:33.495 --> 00:23:35.080
- Yes, sir.
- So, uh...

270
00:23:35.164 --> 00:23:36.415
so what's the show called?

271
00:23:36.498 --> 00:23:38.792
<i>What's it called? Um...</i>

272
00:23:38.876 --> 00:23:41.045
<i>- Gunter, you, uh...
- you want to...</i>

273
00:23:41.128 --> 00:23:42.755
<i>tell Mr. Crystal what it's called?</i>

274
00:23:42.838 --> 00:23:45.883
Uh-huh. It's called
<i>Out of This World.</i>

275
00:23:46.258 --> 00:23:49.303
<i>Out of This World.</i>

276
00:23:49.386 --> 00:23:51.597
<i>That's right. Just imagine it.</i>

277
00:23:52.264 --> 00:23:53.098
Ash?

278
00:23:53.182 --> 00:23:55.184
Uh, yeah, I got it.

279
00:23:56.393 --> 00:24:01.482
<i>A spectacular musical that takes
your audience out of this world.</i>

280
00:24:15.287 --> 00:24:16.705
I love this song.

281
00:24:30.177 --> 00:24:33.389
Sir, your lunch meeting with...
Oh, my...

282
00:24:33.514 --> 00:24:34.640
Not now.

283
00:24:34.723 --> 00:24:36.141
Moon, how did you get in here?

284
00:24:36.225 --> 00:24:37.225
He said not now. Psst.

285
00:24:37.267 --> 00:24:39.019
Yeah, I heard him. Thanks, Jerry.

286
00:24:39.103 --> 00:24:42.648
Are you telling me you got Clay Calloway's
permission to use his song?

287
00:24:42.898 --> 00:24:45.234
- Well, what if I told you I did?
- Ah.

288
00:24:45.317 --> 00:24:48.320
So what, you got some kind of
personal connection to this guy?

289
00:24:48.445 --> 00:24:50.531
- How else would I get it?
- Moon!

290
00:24:50.614 --> 00:24:52.116
Wait, if you know him,

291
00:24:52.199 --> 00:24:55.703
then you could get him
in the show, right?

292
00:24:56.620 --> 00:25:00.332
Oh, that'd be huge for me. Huge.

293
00:25:00.833 --> 00:25:02.376
Sir, I'm sorry, but seriously?

294
00:25:02.459 --> 00:25:07.464
You think this little guy from nowhere
can get Clay Calloway in the show?

295
00:25:09.383 --> 00:25:11.593
Well, Suki, for your information,

296
00:25:11.677 --> 00:25:14.471
I am not just a little guy from nowhere.

297
00:25:15.264 --> 00:25:16.765
Consider it done, sir.

298
00:25:17.057 --> 00:25:18.976
I'll give you three weeks, Moon.

299
00:25:19.059 --> 00:25:21.145
Three weeks to get this show
up and running.

300
00:25:21.228 --> 00:25:22.771
Yes, sir. Thank you.

301
00:25:22.855 --> 00:25:25.441
- Do you really know Clay Calloway?
- Shh. Not now.

302
00:25:25.607 --> 00:25:27.151
- Jerry.
- Oh! Right here, sir.

303
00:25:27.276 --> 00:25:29.737
I want these guys
to start work now.

304
00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:32.740
Set 'em up with our designers,
our dancers, whatever they need.

305
00:25:32.865 --> 00:25:34.491
And get 'em rooms at the hotel, okay?

306
00:25:34.575 --> 00:25:36.785
The very best suites.
The whole shaboodle.

307
00:25:36.869 --> 00:25:37.869
Yes, of course.

308
00:25:38.078 --> 00:25:39.413
Uh, hey, one last thing.

309
00:25:39.496 --> 00:25:42.666
Don't you ever do nothing
to make me look bad. You got that?

310
00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:44.501
I will never let that happen, sir.

311
00:25:44.585 --> 00:25:46.587
You better not,
or I'll throw you off the roof.

312
00:25:48.881 --> 00:25:50.090
Great job, everyone.

313
00:25:50.215 --> 00:25:51.759
Take it away, Raoul.

314
00:25:57.389 --> 00:25:58.474
Oh, my gosh.

315
00:25:58.599 --> 00:26:00.142
- Is this really happening?
- Yeah!

316
00:26:00.225 --> 00:26:02.644
We're playing Redshore City, baby!

317
00:26:02.728 --> 00:26:05.105
Yes, we are, Gunter.

318
00:26:05.355 --> 00:26:08.484
Gunter, sci-fi musical? You're a genius.

319
00:26:08.692 --> 00:26:10.611
Yeah, well, Mama always said,

320
00:26:10.694 --> 00:26:13.572
"Gunter, you're not as stupid
as your papa."

321
00:26:13.655 --> 00:26:15.199
No, you're not.

322
00:26:15.282 --> 00:26:16.867
Hey, Suki.

323
00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:18.160
No hard feelings, huh?

324
00:26:18.243 --> 00:26:20.829
You have no idea
what you're getting into.

325
00:26:20.913 --> 00:26:21.913
Whoa.

326
00:26:21.997 --> 00:26:23.349
- Are you out of your mind?
- What?

327
00:26:23.373 --> 00:26:25.626
Clay Calloway?
I'm, like, his biggest fan,

328
00:26:25.709 --> 00:26:27.920
and I can tell you, the guy is a recluse.

329
00:26:28.003 --> 00:26:31.840
Seriously, after his wife died,
no one's seen him in over 15 years.

330
00:26:31.924 --> 00:26:34.051
Ah. That's not good.

331
00:26:34.134 --> 00:26:35.803
No, it's not.

332
00:26:36.053 --> 00:26:37.221
Uh...

333
00:26:37.387 --> 00:26:40.098
Miss Crawly, I need you
to help me find Clay Calloway.

334
00:26:40.182 --> 00:26:41.809
An address, a phone number, anything.

335
00:26:41.892 --> 00:26:43.852
- But we've got to find that guy.
- Yes, sir.

336
00:26:45.479 --> 00:26:46.355
<i>Good morning!</i>

337
00:26:46.438 --> 00:26:49.483
<i>I'm Linda Le Bon,
and have I got some hot news for you.</i>

338
00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:54.071
<i>Infamous billionaire
Jimmy Crystal has hired</i>

339
00:26:54.154 --> 00:26:55.781
<i>- an unknown theater producer...</i>
- What?

340
00:26:55.906 --> 00:26:58.200
<i>By the name of Buster Moon.</i>

341
00:27:46.623 --> 00:27:49.042
Okay, so this guy
is coming in from that side,

342
00:27:49.126 --> 00:27:50.919
and it's, like, cuckoo crazy,

343
00:27:51.003 --> 00:27:54.882
and then I think we should have, like,
this cool alien tango scene.

344
00:27:55.215 --> 00:27:59.344
"Alien tango scene."

345
00:27:59.511 --> 00:28:01.096
Oh. I love it.

346
00:28:01.179 --> 00:28:02.890
Wait. I've got a better idea.

347
00:28:02.973 --> 00:28:06.602
What if it was, like,
a big underwater scene instead?

348
00:28:07.019 --> 00:28:08.270
- Underwater?
- Yeah, yeah.

349
00:28:08.353 --> 00:28:09.646
I'm sure of this. Write it down.

350
00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:11.690
- Mm, okay.
- Wait, wait.

351
00:28:11.773 --> 00:28:14.318
Stop your clicky-clacky.
I have a better idea.

352
00:28:14.401 --> 00:28:16.820
- Uh, you can't keep changing your mind.
- Why?

353
00:28:16.987 --> 00:28:19.072
Why? Because in exactly 20 minutes,

354
00:28:19.156 --> 00:28:22.284
the stage crew are coming here
to start work on our show,

355
00:28:22.367 --> 00:28:24.578
and we need to lock this stuff down.

356
00:28:24.661 --> 00:28:26.747
My gosh, they're early.

357
00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:29.666
Ooh, and I want to have, like,
this beautiful love scene...

358
00:28:29.791 --> 00:28:31.585
Miss Crawly,
anything on Calloway?

359
00:28:31.668 --> 00:28:33.587
- Hmm, not a thing.
- Oh, geez.

360
00:28:36.548 --> 00:28:37.633
Ah, Mr. Moon.

361
00:28:37.716 --> 00:28:40.093
We're your production team,
and we're here to start...

362
00:28:40.219 --> 00:28:42.721
Yes, yes, yes.
Uh, you're here to work on the show.

363
00:28:42.804 --> 00:28:45.140
And I would gladly invite
you all in right now, but...

364
00:28:45.224 --> 00:28:47.392
We should totally do,
like, a battle scene!

365
00:28:47.476 --> 00:28:49.519
Gunter, no, not now.

366
00:28:49.603 --> 00:28:51.521
I just need a little more time
to, you know,

367
00:28:51.688 --> 00:28:53.357
hammer out a few minor, little details,

368
00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:56.068
so would it be okay
if you all could come back in, like,

369
00:28:56.151 --> 00:28:58.237
I don't know, an hour?
Or maybe four?

370
00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:00.322
And I really appreciate your patience.

371
00:29:00.405 --> 00:29:01.698
Thank you so much.

372
00:29:02.032 --> 00:29:03.659
Hmm. Okay.

373
00:29:04.159 --> 00:29:06.453
Okay.
That was not a great start.

374
00:29:06.536 --> 00:29:09.456
- Oh, look, it's a gift from Mr. Crystal.
- Huh.

375
00:29:09.581 --> 00:29:11.416
It... it says, um,

376
00:29:11.625 --> 00:29:14.127
"Don't screw up, Moon, or else."

377
00:29:14.461 --> 00:29:16.213
Ooh, I've got a better idea.

378
00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:28.642
Good morning.

379
00:29:28.725 --> 00:29:30.936
May I have everyone's attention, please?

380
00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.397
Thank you. Yes.

381
00:29:33.814 --> 00:29:36.775
Okay, um, on behalf
of myself and the cast,

382
00:29:36.858 --> 00:29:40.028
I just want to say that to be given
this incredible opportunity

383
00:29:40.153 --> 00:29:42.572
to work with you all here
at the Crystal Tower Theater,

384
00:29:42.656 --> 00:29:44.491
well, it's an honor for all of us.

385
00:29:44.574 --> 00:29:45.826
And I believe that, together,

386
00:29:45.909 --> 00:29:48.745
we can make a show that'll take
the audience out of this world.

387
00:29:51.415 --> 00:29:53.292
And a big thanks to Steve over here

388
00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:55.460
for staying up all night
to make this model.

389
00:29:55.544 --> 00:29:56.712
Great work, Steve.

390
00:29:56.878 --> 00:29:58.714
And here she is, folks.

391
00:29:58.797 --> 00:30:01.383
The star of our show, Rosita.

392
00:30:01.466 --> 00:30:04.177
That's you, baby!

393
00:30:04.261 --> 00:30:05.387
The lead role?

394
00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:07.556
Trust me, you are perfect for it.

395
00:30:09.391 --> 00:30:11.310
Wait till my kids hear about this.

396
00:30:11.393 --> 00:30:13.478
And so the story goes like this.

397
00:30:13.562 --> 00:30:17.524
Rosita plays an astronaut
searching for a missing space explorer.

398
00:30:17.607 --> 00:30:19.318
Together, with their trusty robot...

399
00:30:19.443 --> 00:30:21.069
- That's me.
- Mm-hm, yes.

400
00:30:21.153 --> 00:30:23.363
They follow the trail across four planets.

401
00:30:23.447 --> 00:30:26.325
There's a planet of war, a planet of love,

402
00:30:26.408 --> 00:30:28.493
a one of despair and one of joy.

403
00:30:28.577 --> 00:30:31.663
And each planet will have its own
spectacular musical number

404
00:30:31.747 --> 00:30:33.665
performed by one of our terrific cast.

405
00:30:34.791 --> 00:30:36.793
And how does it end?
Do I find the explorer?

406
00:30:36.877 --> 00:30:39.338
We have no clue what
we're going to do at the end.

407
00:30:39.421 --> 00:30:41.089
Gunter, no, no, no. Whoa.

408
00:30:41.173 --> 00:30:43.425
We do have great ideas for the ending.

409
00:30:43.508 --> 00:30:44.968
We just... All right.

410
00:30:45.052 --> 00:30:47.346
We've only got three weeks
to make this reality.

411
00:30:47.429 --> 00:30:48.429
Let's get to work.

412
00:30:48.722 --> 00:30:51.391
Johnny, you are gonna play
an alien warrior

413
00:30:51.475 --> 00:30:52.934
in a fantastic battle scene.

414
00:30:53.143 --> 00:30:54.978
- Yes!
- Come with me.

415
00:31:02.527 --> 00:31:04.863
Johnny, I want you to meet
your fellow dancers.

416
00:31:04.946 --> 00:31:06.782
- Hello, lads.
- Hey, how you doing?

417
00:31:06.865 --> 00:31:08.867
Uh, wait.
You said mine was a battle scene.

418
00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:12.204
Well, it is, but Gunter saw it
as more of a... a dance battle.

419
00:31:12.287 --> 00:31:14.247
- Yeah!
- Okay...

420
00:31:14.331 --> 00:31:16.166
Johnny, don't worry.
You're gonna be working

421
00:31:16.249 --> 00:31:19.002
with the number one choreographer
in Redshore City.

422
00:31:19.086 --> 00:31:21.213
"Klaus Kickenklober."

423
00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:23.382
Yep. Klaus will turn you
into a pro in no time.

424
00:31:23.465 --> 00:31:24.508
Okay.

425
00:31:24.591 --> 00:31:26.134
- Uh...
- Mr. Moon?

426
00:31:26.927 --> 00:31:28.428
Meena, you okay?

427
00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:32.682
Gunter said I'm in a romantic scene
and, uh, uh...

428
00:31:32.766 --> 00:31:34.393
I have to kiss someone.

429
00:31:34.643 --> 00:31:37.813
Yeah. It's gonna be an amazing,
beautiful, romantic scene.

430
00:31:37.938 --> 00:31:41.358
Mr. Moon, I've never even had
a boyfriend or any of that stuff.

431
00:31:41.608 --> 00:31:42.651
Ah, don't you worry.

432
00:31:42.818 --> 00:31:45.195
I'm gonna cast a great partner for you.

433
00:31:45.278 --> 00:31:46.738
- Promise?
- Promise.

434
00:31:46.947 --> 00:31:50.409
Mr. Moon, we're ready to start building
the rest of the sets and...

435
00:31:50.492 --> 00:31:51.827
Okay, okay, okay, listen.

436
00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:53.995
I don't exactly know
what they are yet,

437
00:31:54.121 --> 00:31:56.581
so could you give me one more
night to figure this out?

438
00:31:56.665 --> 00:31:59.042
Hey, this guy
doesn't have it figured out,

439
00:31:59.126 --> 00:32:01.545
- so we can't start work right now.
- Mason?

440
00:32:01.628 --> 00:32:03.268
- Did everybody hear that?
- Hey, don't...

441
00:32:03.338 --> 00:32:04.923
He does not have the show
figured out.

442
00:32:05.006 --> 00:32:07.676
I'm looking into his eyes,

443
00:32:07.759 --> 00:32:09.845
- and all I see is fear.
- Uh-uh. Mm-mm.

444
00:32:09.928 --> 00:32:12.055
- Hey, listen. Yeah.
- And a little bit of shame.

445
00:32:12.139 --> 00:32:14.724
Look, I think everyone heard you, Mason.
Thank you so much.

446
00:32:14.808 --> 00:32:16.810
Gunter...
We have work to do.

447
00:32:16.893 --> 00:32:19.729
And then I'm thinking,
Ash, you know, she can, like,

448
00:32:19.813 --> 00:32:22.065
totally have a duet
with Clay Calloway,

449
00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:24.985
'cause, like, she's a star
that is, like,

450
00:32:25.068 --> 00:32:27.362
guiding them all the way
back home again.

451
00:32:27.446 --> 00:32:29.906
Yes, Gunter.
That's perfect for Ash.

452
00:32:30.949 --> 00:32:33.243
Mommy!

453
00:32:33.535 --> 00:32:35.495
Oh, my darlings, you're here.

454
00:32:35.579 --> 00:32:36.913
Yeah, Johnny!

455
00:32:36.997 --> 00:32:38.373
Oh.

456
00:32:38.457 --> 00:32:40.834
I wasn't expecting you till the morning.

457
00:32:40.917 --> 00:32:43.128
I know, but they couldn't wait to see you.

458
00:32:43.378 --> 00:32:45.088
The star of the show, huh?

459
00:32:45.172 --> 00:32:48.091
Can you believe it?
It's literally my dream come true.

460
00:32:48.216 --> 00:32:50.260
- I know. Mwah.
- Ew.

461
00:32:50.343 --> 00:32:52.262
I am so proud of you, honey.

462
00:32:54.139 --> 00:32:55.432
Uh... help.

463
00:32:55.515 --> 00:32:57.809
Mr. Moon, I found him.

464
00:32:57.934 --> 00:33:00.479
- Clay Calloway?
- Yeah. I found his home address.

465
00:33:00.562 --> 00:33:02.230
No way.

466
00:33:02.314 --> 00:33:03.398
Yes way.

467
00:33:03.482 --> 00:33:06.693
Miss Crawly, I'm gonna need you
to go visit him first thing tomorrow.

468
00:33:06.776 --> 00:33:08.653
- Yes, sir.
- You'll need to rent a car

469
00:33:08.737 --> 00:33:11.031
and take him a letter
and maybe that fruit basket.

470
00:33:11.156 --> 00:33:13.575
- Yes, the fruit basket. You got that?
- Got it.

471
00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:16.953
And one, two, three, four,

472
00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:19.247
five, six, seven, eight.

473
00:33:19.331 --> 00:33:21.249
We're dancing. We're dancing.

474
00:33:21.333 --> 00:33:23.335
We're holding. We're holding.

475
00:33:23.418 --> 00:33:24.503
Stay <i>en pointe.</i>

476
00:33:24.586 --> 00:33:26.796
Shuffle and hold.

477
00:33:26.922 --> 00:33:29.257
I said hold, Johnny.
He's not holding.

478
00:33:29.674 --> 00:33:32.260
- And one, two, three, four...
- All right, I am trying.

479
00:33:32.344 --> 00:33:37.140
Let's not forget, this is Redshore City,
not your little local theater.

480
00:33:37.224 --> 00:33:39.309
And five, six, seven, eight.

481
00:33:39.392 --> 00:33:41.269
Ryan, that was excellent.

482
00:33:41.436 --> 00:33:43.438
Johnny, you are doing it wrong.

483
00:33:43.688 --> 00:33:44.856
That was awful.

484
00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:46.233
Johnny. You can do better.

485
00:33:46.316 --> 00:33:48.276
- He's freaking me out.
- Johnny.

486
00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:49.778
- I'm trying.
- Thrust.

487
00:33:49.861 --> 00:33:51.404
And thrust, and thrust.

488
00:33:51.488 --> 00:33:52.864
You're not thrusting, Johnny.

489
00:33:52.948 --> 00:33:54.324
- Come on. Thrust.
- Thrust.

490
00:33:54.449 --> 00:33:56.618
Still not thrusting.
Can you thrust, please?

491
00:33:56.701 --> 00:34:00.580
Five, six, seven,
and tippy-toes, tippy-toes.

492
00:34:00.664 --> 00:34:02.457
I don't see your tippy-toes.

493
00:34:02.541 --> 00:34:04.042
Come on, he's having a laugh.

494
00:34:04.125 --> 00:34:06.628
- Tippy-toes. Come on, let's go.
- Seven...

495
00:34:06.711 --> 00:34:09.089
That is rubbish, terribly poor,
really bad.

496
00:34:12.092 --> 00:34:14.344
That bloke absolutely hates me.

497
00:34:14.970 --> 00:34:17.764
Hang in there, Johnny.
The first week's always tough.

498
00:34:17.847 --> 00:34:19.641
Yeah. You're right. You're right.

499
00:34:19.724 --> 00:34:21.476
Meena, come and meet
your partner.

500
00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:22.727
Oh, my gosh, he's here?

501
00:34:22.894 --> 00:34:25.522
Yep. He's called Darius.
Won a ton of awards.

502
00:34:25.605 --> 00:34:28.316
And I think you guys
are gonna have great chemistry.

503
00:34:42.539 --> 00:34:43.832
Wow.

504
00:34:43.915 --> 00:34:45.208
That's really great, Darius.

505
00:34:45.292 --> 00:34:47.752
Uh, yeah, it's a scene
from the last show I was in.

506
00:34:47.836 --> 00:34:50.088
I'm sure you heard of it...
<i>Hope Against Hope.</i>

507
00:34:50.171 --> 00:34:52.716
Gosh, I won every award in town.

508
00:34:53.049 --> 00:34:54.843
Uh, the Golden Piccolo
for Best Crying.

509
00:34:54.926 --> 00:34:58.346
Uh, the Archer Newman Award
for Outstanding Hair.

510
00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:59.889
Oh, yeah.

511
00:34:59.973 --> 00:35:02.601
Anyway, my costar,
she was just like you, Gina.

512
00:35:02.726 --> 00:35:04.060
- She was, uh...
- Uh, it's Meena.

513
00:35:04.185 --> 00:35:05.312
Excuse me?

514
00:35:05.478 --> 00:35:08.440
My name, it's Meena, not Gina.

515
00:35:08.607 --> 00:35:09.983
Yeah, okay.

516
00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:12.652
In the future,
if you could not interrupt me,

517
00:35:12.736 --> 00:35:14.070
that would be way better.

518
00:35:14.154 --> 00:35:16.406
Okay, okay. Let's rehearse.

519
00:35:24.748 --> 00:35:25.748
Uh... Oh.

520
00:35:29.127 --> 00:35:30.462
No, no, no, no, no, uh...

521
00:35:30.795 --> 00:35:32.839
This song is not helping her at all.

522
00:35:48.521 --> 00:35:49.689
Oh, boy.

523
00:35:49.773 --> 00:35:51.733
So, where's Calloway?

524
00:35:51.816 --> 00:35:53.693
Uh, he'll be here very soon.

525
00:35:53.777 --> 00:35:56.237
- Mm, is that so?
- It is indeed so.

526
00:35:56.321 --> 00:36:01.201
In fact, my trusty assistant Miss Crawly
is on her way to meet him right now.

527
00:36:15.715 --> 00:36:18.593
- <i>Your destination is on the right.</i>
- On the right. Okay.

528
00:37:00.385 --> 00:37:01.385
Oh.

529
00:37:14.274 --> 00:37:15.275
Oh.

530
00:37:24.868 --> 00:37:26.703
Mr. Calloway?

531
00:37:26.828 --> 00:37:28.663
Hello?

532
00:37:28.788 --> 00:37:30.665
Is anybody home?

533
00:37:40.133 --> 00:37:41.133
Ooh.

534
00:38:02.655 --> 00:38:04.449
Okay, I got you.

535
00:38:20.256 --> 00:38:21.549
Clay Callowa...

536
00:38:28.223 --> 00:38:29.557
Oopsie-daisy.

537
00:38:29.891 --> 00:38:31.351
<i>Hello.</i>

538
00:38:31.434 --> 00:38:33.603
<i>I can't take your call right now,</i>

539
00:38:33.728 --> 00:38:36.981
<i>but please leave me a message
after the beep.</i>

540
00:38:38.817 --> 00:38:40.568
Miss Crawly, it's me, Mr. Moon.

541
00:38:40.652 --> 00:38:43.530
I haven't heard from you in a while.
I'm starting to worry here.

542
00:38:43.655 --> 00:38:44.823
Moon!

543
00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:46.783
Mr. Crystal.

544
00:38:46.866 --> 00:38:49.118
Your set designs are a disgrace.

545
00:38:49.327 --> 00:38:50.495
What?

546
00:38:52.288 --> 00:38:54.666
I'm just messing with you.

547
00:38:54.749 --> 00:38:56.459
Where's your sense of humor, huh?

548
00:38:58.253 --> 00:39:00.171
Anyway, this is my daughter Porsha.

549
00:39:00.255 --> 00:39:01.548
Hey.

550
00:39:01.631 --> 00:39:03.049
Nice to meet you, Porsha.

551
00:39:03.132 --> 00:39:05.510
She wants to meet Calloway.
Big fan, aren't you, baby?

552
00:39:05.593 --> 00:39:08.304
Oh, my gosh, I'm, like,
so into vintage right now.

553
00:39:08.388 --> 00:39:09.388
So, where is he?

554
00:39:09.973 --> 00:39:11.766
Uh, well...

555
00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:14.060
I'm not expecting Clay on set just yet.

556
00:39:14.185 --> 00:39:15.228
- I mean...
- Wait.

557
00:39:15.311 --> 00:39:16.938
Is this, like, a sky-fi show?

558
00:39:17.021 --> 00:39:19.816
Uh, sci-fi? Yes. Yes, it is.

559
00:39:19.941 --> 00:39:22.485
Oh, my gosh, I love sky-fi.

560
00:39:22.569 --> 00:39:23.611
Mr. Moon!

561
00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:25.738
- We're ready on the tower.
- Oh.

562
00:39:25.822 --> 00:39:27.699
Thank you, Sasha. We, uh...

563
00:39:27.782 --> 00:39:29.534
We're gonna rehearse,
Mr. Crystal, so...

564
00:39:29.617 --> 00:39:31.369
Yeah, you go and do your rehearsing thing.

565
00:39:31.452 --> 00:39:32.912
- Go, go, go, go.
- Playback.

566
00:39:34.789 --> 00:39:37.125
Okay.

567
00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:38.376
All set.

568
00:39:38.459 --> 00:39:41.421
Just remember to release
the safety catch before you jump, okay?

569
00:39:41.504 --> 00:39:43.047
Okay, yeah.

570
00:39:43.131 --> 00:39:45.258
Is Mommy gonna jump off that?

571
00:39:45.341 --> 00:39:46.926
She sure is.

572
00:39:47.093 --> 00:39:48.595
Wow!

573
00:40:08.823 --> 00:40:10.909
Uh...

574
00:40:11.034 --> 00:40:12.034
Oh, my gosh.

575
00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:13.661
Gunter.

576
00:40:14.329 --> 00:40:18.750
Mr. Moon, I think Rosita's having,
like, a major freak-out up here.

577
00:40:19.083 --> 00:40:20.001
Oh, no.

578
00:40:20.084 --> 00:40:23.004
Hey, Moon, you really think
the mommy pig's gonna pull this off?

579
00:40:23.087 --> 00:40:24.172
Mommy pig?

580
00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:25.632
Absolutely, sir.

581
00:40:26.049 --> 00:40:28.843
Believe me, there's nothing
Rosita can't do.

582
00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:30.010
I can't do this.

583
00:40:30.053 --> 00:40:32.221
Why didn't you tell me
you were afraid of heights?

584
00:40:32.305 --> 00:40:35.141
I wasn't. I've never been afraid
in my whole life before,

585
00:40:35.224 --> 00:40:37.143
but I... suddenly, I just...

586
00:40:37.226 --> 00:40:39.103
I don't know what happened to me.

587
00:40:39.187 --> 00:40:41.731
- Did my kids see that?
- Hey, you guys.

588
00:40:41.814 --> 00:40:42.982
What's going on up here?

589
00:40:43.107 --> 00:40:44.275
Who is that?

590
00:40:44.484 --> 00:40:45.902
Ooh. Can I try?

591
00:40:46.069 --> 00:40:48.780
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I can't let you jump off here.

592
00:40:48.863 --> 00:40:51.741
Daddy, he won't let me jump!

593
00:40:51.866 --> 00:40:53.660
Moon, come on.
Let her do the thing.

594
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:55.870
- Yay!
- Porsha, wait!

595
00:40:55.954 --> 00:40:57.830
Whoa, hey. Uh, just a minute.

596
00:41:03.294 --> 00:41:04.754
I love it!

597
00:41:04.921 --> 00:41:06.923
Whee! It's easy!

598
00:41:07.006 --> 00:41:08.675
All right. Let's get you down, Rosita.

599
00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.301
Oh, my gosh, you guys.

600
00:41:10.385 --> 00:41:13.429
This is exactly like the dream
I had last night.

601
00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:16.015
Seriously, you were all there.

602
00:41:16.182 --> 00:41:19.435
And you and you and that
funny-looking guy over there.

603
00:41:19.519 --> 00:41:20.812
- Um...
- All of you.

604
00:41:20.895 --> 00:41:23.648
And you asked me to sing for you.

605
00:41:23.773 --> 00:41:26.109
I... I did?

606
00:41:26.192 --> 00:41:29.195
Yeah. And so, I was like...

607
00:41:51.759 --> 00:41:55.013
Well, that's a lovely dream
you had there, Porsha.

608
00:41:55.138 --> 00:41:57.849
Um, okay, everybody, back
to first positions, please.

609
00:41:57.974 --> 00:41:58.975
Here, Rosita.

610
00:41:59.058 --> 00:42:00.810
You want to try with the helmet
this time?

611
00:42:00.893 --> 00:42:02.687
Oh, but now I know
what the dream meant.

612
00:42:02.770 --> 00:42:05.231
Yeah. She's afraid.

613
00:42:05.314 --> 00:42:07.233
She'll never be able to play the part.

614
00:42:07.316 --> 00:42:11.320
But here I am, and I'm young,
and I'm not afraid at all.

615
00:42:11.404 --> 00:42:14.323
I can't just give you Rosita's part.
I mean...

616
00:42:14.866 --> 00:42:16.784
Moon, walk with me.

617
00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:20.580
What's wrong with you, huh?
What, you got a kink in your think?

618
00:42:20.663 --> 00:42:22.790
It's just that I wrote
this part for Rosita and...

619
00:42:22.874 --> 00:42:24.500
Yeah. Let me tell you something, Moon.

620
00:42:24.584 --> 00:42:28.421
What you got here is an opportunity
to make me happy.

621
00:42:28.546 --> 00:42:30.548
And when an opportunity
like that comes along,

622
00:42:30.673 --> 00:42:32.008
you'd better grab it!

623
00:42:32.175 --> 00:42:33.426
You get me?

624
00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:35.011
- Uh...
- What?

625
00:42:35.094 --> 00:42:37.597
You don't think my daughter's
good enough for your show?

626
00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:40.058
No, Mr. Crystal.
Well, I think she's wonderful.

627
00:42:40.183 --> 00:42:41.934
Oh, good. So you'll figure it out.

628
00:42:42.018 --> 00:42:43.686
I'll... Yes, I will.

629
00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:46.814
- Daddy, I'm hungry for French toast.
- Jerry!

630
00:42:46.898 --> 00:42:48.566
- Yes, sir.
- Get her some of that.

631
00:42:48.691 --> 00:42:50.276
And, by the way, I like the set.

632
00:42:50.359 --> 00:42:52.320
That whole
"rings moving around" thing.

633
00:42:52.403 --> 00:42:54.197
Creative, quirky. I like it.

634
00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:55.865
Bye, Daddy.

635
00:42:55.948 --> 00:42:59.160
Mm-kay. Let's have Porsha measured
for a costume right away, please.

636
00:42:59.243 --> 00:43:00.078
Right away.

637
00:43:00.161 --> 00:43:02.288
Would you just get
the French toast, Jerry?

638
00:43:02.371 --> 00:43:03.873
I'm getting the French toast.

639
00:43:03.956 --> 00:43:04.874
You okay?

640
00:43:04.957 --> 00:43:07.335
A little shaky, but I'm okay.

641
00:43:07.418 --> 00:43:09.253
Yeah. You know, uh...

642
00:43:09.337 --> 00:43:11.422
Look, maybe this is for the best, huh?

643
00:43:11.506 --> 00:43:14.967
- I mean, you really were scared up there.
- Right.

644
00:43:15.051 --> 00:43:16.886
I'll write you another part, Rosita.

645
00:43:16.969 --> 00:43:19.138
A really... a really, really great part.

646
00:43:19.222 --> 00:43:21.182
- You all right?
- Oh, I'm fine.

647
00:43:21.265 --> 00:43:23.101
- Really?
- Yes, you're all very sweet,

648
00:43:23.184 --> 00:43:26.187
but like Mr. Moon says,
this is probably for the best.

649
00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:28.022
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

650
00:43:28.106 --> 00:43:30.358
I am completely fine with this.

651
00:43:37.198 --> 00:43:38.407
Hey, honey.

652
00:43:38.908 --> 00:43:41.744
Are you... you're sure you're not,
you know, upset?

653
00:43:41.828 --> 00:43:43.454
No, I'm good.

654
00:43:43.579 --> 00:43:47.291
Um, can I please just have
the bathroom to myself for five minutes?

655
00:43:47.375 --> 00:43:48.376
You got it.

656
00:43:48.584 --> 00:43:50.837
Kids, go get your jammies on!

657
00:43:54.257 --> 00:43:56.467
Thank you for choosing
to drive with Royalty.

658
00:43:57.927 --> 00:43:59.595
All right. Bye-bye.

659
00:44:10.106 --> 00:44:11.899
Oh, hello, young sir.

660
00:44:12.066 --> 00:44:14.944
Um, oh, yes, you'll...
you'll be pleased to hear

661
00:44:15.027 --> 00:44:18.364
I did bring it back with a full tank.

662
00:44:22.493 --> 00:44:25.830
And one, two, three, four,

663
00:44:25.955 --> 00:44:27.999
five, six, seven.

664
00:44:28.124 --> 00:44:30.751
And one, two, three, four,

665
00:44:30.877 --> 00:44:32.670
five, six, seven.

666
00:44:32.795 --> 00:44:35.673
And one, two, three, four,

667
00:44:35.756 --> 00:44:37.800
five, six, seven. And...

668
00:44:37.884 --> 00:44:39.635
Sorry I'm late,
Mr. Kickenklober.

669
00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:42.180
I was practicing all morning.
I just lost track of time.

670
00:44:42.263 --> 00:44:45.683
Oh. I thought maybe you had been
involved in a terrible accident

671
00:44:45.766 --> 00:44:48.019
and we'd never have to see you again,
but never mind.

672
00:44:48.102 --> 00:44:49.604
Seriously?

673
00:44:49.729 --> 00:44:51.564
Why do you have to be
so mean all the time?

674
00:44:51.647 --> 00:44:53.232
'Cause only when we suffer...

675
00:44:53.316 --> 00:44:55.318
can we be great.

676
00:44:55.443 --> 00:44:57.236
Places, everyone!

677
00:44:57.361 --> 00:45:00.573
Ryan, you'll be playing his opponent
in the climax of the scene.

678
00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:01.908
Now...

679
00:45:02.742 --> 00:45:06.787
let's see if little Johnny
has learned the steps.

680
00:45:22.637 --> 00:45:23.971
Whoa. Sorry. Sorry, sorry.

681
00:45:24.555 --> 00:45:25.890
- Ow! Sorry.
- Wrong.

682
00:45:26.849 --> 00:45:27.850
Again!

683
00:45:30.478 --> 00:45:32.146
Higher.

684
00:45:32.229 --> 00:45:33.229
So bad.

685
00:45:33.314 --> 00:45:34.899
Again!

686
00:45:36.359 --> 00:45:37.985
No!

687
00:45:38.194 --> 00:45:39.236
Again!

688
00:45:39.779 --> 00:45:40.863
Come on.

689
00:45:42.031 --> 00:45:43.574
Yuck! Again!

690
00:45:44.951 --> 00:45:46.077
- Whoa.
- Come on!

691
00:46:01.676 --> 00:46:03.552
Man.

692
00:46:51.142 --> 00:46:54.562
Thank you.
Thank you so much, everyone.

693
00:46:54.645 --> 00:46:57.732
Wow, wow. You are an amazing crowd.

694
00:46:57.857 --> 00:46:59.358
Mate, you're amazing.

695
00:46:59.442 --> 00:47:01.068
Much appreciated.

696
00:47:01.152 --> 00:47:03.237
- Thank you so much.
- Uh...

697
00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:04.989
Uh, um...

698
00:47:05.197 --> 00:47:06.991
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for coming.

699
00:47:07.116 --> 00:47:10.828
Okay. Thank you very much,
little guy. Wow, so kind.

700
00:47:10.911 --> 00:47:14.081
Listen, could I buy you a coffee
or, uh, maybe something to eat?

701
00:47:14.165 --> 00:47:16.459
Whoa, that's forward, ain't it?

702
00:47:16.542 --> 00:47:18.335
What? No, no, no. I didn't mean...

703
00:47:18.419 --> 00:47:20.588
I just would love to talk
to you about maybe...

704
00:47:20.713 --> 00:47:23.007
Hey! You got a license to perform here?

705
00:47:23.132 --> 00:47:24.842
Actually, I'd love a chat. Let's go.

706
00:47:28.596 --> 00:47:32.016
Here you go. One volcano smoothie
with extra chocolate lava.

707
00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:34.643
Shut up.

708
00:47:36.812 --> 00:47:39.356
Here. 50 bucks.

709
00:47:39.482 --> 00:47:42.109
Honestly, if you could just give me
some dance lessons,

710
00:47:42.193 --> 00:47:44.153
you would literally be saving my life.

711
00:47:44.236 --> 00:47:48.157
Wait, if you're in a real show,
how come you don't have a choreographer?

712
00:47:48.282 --> 00:47:51.160
I do, but it turns out
he's a massive weirdo.

713
00:47:51.285 --> 00:47:54.330
And how do I know
that you're not a weirdo?

714
00:47:54.413 --> 00:47:56.624
Hmm? How do I know that you're legit?

715
00:47:56.707 --> 00:47:59.085
Just come with me to rehearsals.
See for yourself.

716
00:47:59.168 --> 00:48:02.546
Whoa. I'm not just gonna follow
some guy I don't know to rehearsals.

717
00:48:02.797 --> 00:48:05.424
Well, how else am I supposed
to prove that I'm legit?

718
00:48:19.146 --> 00:48:20.146
What are you doing?

719
00:48:34.787 --> 00:48:36.038
Yeah! Woo-hoo!

720
00:48:41.335 --> 00:48:43.796
I knew you were a weirdo.

721
00:48:46.507 --> 00:48:47.800
Whoa.

722
00:48:47.883 --> 00:48:49.760
- This is sick!
- See?

723
00:48:49.844 --> 00:48:51.262
<i>First positions, please.</i>

724
00:48:51.345 --> 00:48:52.763
Whoa. Mate, look at that.

725
00:48:52.847 --> 00:48:55.057
- Hey. Who are you?
- It's all right. She's with me.

726
00:48:55.141 --> 00:48:56.600
Pleased to meet you. I'm Nooshy.

727
00:48:56.684 --> 00:48:58.769
I'm his dance coach.
And I really love that hat.

728
00:48:58.853 --> 00:49:00.980
She's right. Great hat.

729
00:49:02.606 --> 00:49:06.944
You think some riffraff street dancer
can help you more than me?

730
00:49:07.069 --> 00:49:08.696
- Riffraff?
- Okay, okay. Hang on.

731
00:49:08.779 --> 00:49:10.781
She's just gonna give me
some extra lessons.

732
00:49:10.865 --> 00:49:13.701
Oh, because I, Klaus Kickenklober,

733
00:49:13.826 --> 00:49:17.246
master choreographer,
am not good enough for Johnny.

734
00:49:17.329 --> 00:49:20.249
- No, that's not what I meant.
- Yes, I'm irrelevant to him.

735
00:49:20.332 --> 00:49:22.960
I'm just a stupid, fat, old monkey.

736
00:49:23.043 --> 00:49:24.712
- I don't think that at all.
- I do.

737
00:49:24.795 --> 00:49:26.130
Shh! Please.

738
00:49:26.213 --> 00:49:27.923
She's only trying to help me, that's all.

739
00:49:28.007 --> 00:49:29.842
Dude, anyway,
I only need two days with him.

740
00:49:29.925 --> 00:49:31.844
Two days? Ha!

741
00:49:31.927 --> 00:49:33.596
Two hundred years, more like.

742
00:49:33.679 --> 00:49:35.097
Two days. He'll be amazing.

743
00:49:35.181 --> 00:49:36.515
Oh, really?

744
00:49:36.724 --> 00:49:38.309
Well, if he is,

745
00:49:38.392 --> 00:49:41.687
I will eat my hat.

746
00:49:42.021 --> 00:49:44.231
<i>Okay, everybody, from the top.</i>

747
00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:46.567
<i>Stand by, playback.</i>

748
00:49:46.859 --> 00:49:49.111
<i>Lots of energy now, and...</i>

749
00:49:50.821 --> 00:49:53.657
Miss Crawly?

750
00:49:55.159 --> 00:49:57.036
You can't go back there, Mr. Moon.

751
00:49:57.119 --> 00:49:58.829
- Never.
- What happened to you?

752
00:49:58.954 --> 00:50:01.498
That lion, you see, he's crazy. Crazy!

753
00:50:01.582 --> 00:50:04.168
Oh, he's crazy.

754
00:50:04.251 --> 00:50:06.545
Pew. Pew, pew.

755
00:50:06.629 --> 00:50:08.005
- Wow, she's a mess.
- Pew, pew!

756
00:50:08.088 --> 00:50:11.050
- You're not gonna go out there, are you?
- Gonna have to. I mean...

757
00:50:11.133 --> 00:50:12.843
<i>All set over here, Mr. Moon.</i>

758
00:50:12.927 --> 00:50:14.595
<i>Okay. Playback!</i>

759
00:50:14.803 --> 00:50:17.556
<i>Stand by, Rosita.</i>

760
00:50:18.724 --> 00:50:20.434
<i>And... action!</i>

761
00:50:30.736 --> 00:50:31.736
And cue Porsha.

762
00:50:38.369 --> 00:50:42.373
Take that, you nasty alien monster.

763
00:50:43.832 --> 00:50:44.959
Did I do good?

764
00:50:45.626 --> 00:50:46.835
<i>Yeah.</i>

765
00:50:46.961 --> 00:50:49.213
<i>That was so good.</i>

766
00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:50.673
Yay!

767
00:50:51.215 --> 00:50:54.009
Did you hear that?
He thinks I'm awesome.

768
00:50:55.928 --> 00:50:58.180
Okay, she cannot act.

769
00:50:58.264 --> 00:51:00.099
Shh. I know. I know.

770
00:51:00.224 --> 00:51:01.725
But I got to keep Mr. Crystal happy.

771
00:51:01.850 --> 00:51:05.020
Take that, you nasty alien monster.

772
00:51:05.145 --> 00:51:07.189
Excuse me, but Mr. Crystal
wants to see you.

773
00:51:07.314 --> 00:51:09.275
Take that,
you nasty alien monster.

774
00:51:09.358 --> 00:51:12.361
- Well, I could come by this afternoon.
- He means now. Right now.

775
00:51:12.444 --> 00:51:14.905
Okay.

776
00:51:17.032 --> 00:51:20.119
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- Yes, I did. Yes, I did.

777
00:51:20.202 --> 00:51:22.079
- Come on in.
- Whoa.

778
00:51:22.162 --> 00:51:24.039
This place is incredible.

779
00:51:24.123 --> 00:51:25.582
Pretty great, huh?

780
00:51:26.208 --> 00:51:28.127
So, how's it going with Calloway?

781
00:51:28.377 --> 00:51:29.878
Calloway?

782
00:51:29.962 --> 00:51:31.922
It's, uh... it's good.

783
00:51:32.006 --> 00:51:33.757
- Yeah. Very good.
- Right, right.

784
00:51:34.466 --> 00:51:36.051
Well, let me ask you something.

785
00:51:36.135 --> 00:51:38.595
What did I do to make you
disrespect me, huh?

786
00:51:38.762 --> 00:51:39.680
What?

787
00:51:39.763 --> 00:51:42.599
Oh, what? You think I'm an idiot?
Some kind of bozo?

788
00:51:42.683 --> 00:51:44.935
No. No, sir, not at all.

789
00:51:45.019 --> 00:51:48.355
My team, they talked
to Calloway's lawyer,

790
00:51:48.439 --> 00:51:52.318
and they say he's never
heard of you or your show.

791
00:51:52.401 --> 00:51:54.528
Really? They said that? Uh...

792
00:51:54.653 --> 00:51:56.780
- You lied to me!
- I... I didn't mean to.

793
00:51:56.864 --> 00:51:59.074
Okay? Honestly, I really thought
I could get him.

794
00:51:59.158 --> 00:52:00.868
No one makes me look
like a fool! No one!

795
00:52:00.951 --> 00:52:03.162
I wouldn't dream of doing that to you.

796
00:52:03.245 --> 00:52:05.247
I swear, if you didn't have
my kid in your show,

797
00:52:05.331 --> 00:52:06.832
you'd be out
of that window by now!

798
00:52:06.915 --> 00:52:08.584
Please. I'm so sorry.

799
00:52:08.667 --> 00:52:10.878
You'd better have Calloway
by the end of next week,

800
00:52:10.961 --> 00:52:12.296
- or so help me!
- I will.

801
00:52:12.379 --> 00:52:15.174
I... I'll get him.
I won't let you down, sir.

802
00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:18.635
Oh, I know you won't let me down.

803
00:52:19.053 --> 00:52:21.597
- Jerry, get in here!
- Yes, sir. Right here, sir.

804
00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:23.682
- Clean this mess up.
- Absolutely, I'd love to.

805
00:52:25.225 --> 00:52:28.103
Listen up. I got to go to Calloway's,
and I got to go ASAP.

806
00:52:28.187 --> 00:52:30.147
- Oh, no, please don't go there.
- Don't worry.

807
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:32.358
I know you said he's crazy,
but I'll be all right.

808
00:52:32.441 --> 00:52:34.777
- Can I go with you, please?
- Uh, I don't know.

809
00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:37.738
Come on, you're gonna need me.
I know everything about this guy.

810
00:52:37.821 --> 00:52:40.282
- Uh... I think you're right.
- Yes!

811
00:52:40.407 --> 00:52:42.368
Listen, Gunter, you've got to figure out

812
00:52:42.451 --> 00:52:43.994
the ending of this show on your own.

813
00:52:44.078 --> 00:52:45.078
- On my own?
- Yes.

814
00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:47.456
Miss Crawly, I need you
to take charge while I'm away.

815
00:52:47.539 --> 00:52:48.767
- Yes, sir.
- Now, listen to me.

816
00:52:48.791 --> 00:52:50.876
You got to bring your A-game here,
Miss Crawly.

817
00:52:51.001 --> 00:52:52.378
I'm serious. You got to be tough.

818
00:52:52.503 --> 00:52:54.380
- Yes, I got to be tough.
- You got to be firm.

819
00:52:54.463 --> 00:52:55.923
Oh, and I got to be firm. Yes.

820
00:52:56.048 --> 00:52:56.965
And you cannot...

821
00:52:57.049 --> 00:53:00.010
I repeat, cannot let production
fall behind, not one little bit.

822
00:53:00.094 --> 00:53:02.596
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir, Mr. Moon, sir.

823
00:53:10.187 --> 00:53:11.187
<i>Mason!</i>

824
00:53:11.230 --> 00:53:13.857
<i>That volcano should've been
finished yesterday!</i>

825
00:53:13.982 --> 00:53:16.318
- We're on it, Miss Crawly.
<i>- You better be!</i>

826
00:53:16.443 --> 00:53:17.653
<i>Meena, Darius,</i>

827
00:53:17.736 --> 00:53:21.198
<i>take it from the top, and this time,
put a little juice in it, will you?</i>

828
00:53:21.281 --> 00:53:23.492
I'm trying my best, Miss Crawly.

829
00:53:24.159 --> 00:53:25.369
A little juice?

830
00:53:26.078 --> 00:53:27.329
Hey, everybody.

831
00:53:30.666 --> 00:53:32.751
<i>You're two hours late for rehearsal!</i>

832
00:53:32.835 --> 00:53:36.171
Wait. Wait, where's the koala?
Who are you?

833
00:53:36.255 --> 00:53:37.881
<i>I'm in charge! That's who!</i>

834
00:53:37.965 --> 00:53:40.092
<i>Now, get your tail
to wardrobe, sweetheart.</i>

835
00:53:52.938 --> 00:53:55.315
Oh, my gosh. There he is.

836
00:53:56.233 --> 00:53:57.484
That's him.

837
00:53:57.693 --> 00:53:59.611
Holy moly, it really is.

838
00:54:00.529 --> 00:54:02.489
He doesn't look so scary.

839
00:54:03.157 --> 00:54:04.741
Mr. Calloway!

840
00:54:05.659 --> 00:54:07.995
- Go away!
- No, please.

841
00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:11.248
We... we just want to talk
to you for one minute. That's all.

842
00:54:14.334 --> 00:54:16.962
We are not leaving until you talk to us.

843
00:54:18.672 --> 00:54:22.801
Fine. If you're not coming over here,
we're coming over to you.

844
00:54:22.885 --> 00:54:24.720
No! Stay off the fence!

845
00:54:24.803 --> 00:54:26.930
Don't listen to him.

846
00:55:00.088 --> 00:55:01.381
<i>Stop, stop, stop!</i>

847
00:55:01.465 --> 00:55:03.467
<i>Porsha, you're still messing it up.</i>

848
00:55:03.550 --> 00:55:05.260
It's not my fault.

849
00:55:05.344 --> 00:55:07.137
He keeps missing the catch.

850
00:55:07.262 --> 00:55:09.640
I think she's trying to kill me.

851
00:55:09.765 --> 00:55:11.391
<i>Reset. Let's go again.</i>

852
00:55:11.934 --> 00:55:13.143
<i>Meena! Darius!</i>

853
00:55:13.268 --> 00:55:14.561
<i>We're coming to you next,</i>

854
00:55:14.645 --> 00:55:17.814
<i>and I better see some chemistry
between you two.</i>

855
00:55:17.898 --> 00:55:19.983
Okay, let's run these steps
one more time.

856
00:55:20.067 --> 00:55:23.654
So, music starts, I step out,

857
00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:26.114
do my moves, fancy moves.

858
00:55:26.198 --> 00:55:27.991
Step together, drop.

859
00:55:28.075 --> 00:55:31.995
Gazing at each other like
we're burning up with love...

860
00:55:33.121 --> 00:55:34.540
What are you doing with your face?

861
00:55:36.458 --> 00:55:39.545
Your face looks broken. What is that?

862
00:55:39.711 --> 00:55:40.837
Uh...

863
00:55:41.046 --> 00:55:43.465
I was falling in love?

864
00:55:44.216 --> 00:55:45.801
Yeah, Gina, listen.

865
00:55:45.884 --> 00:55:49.221
I'm sorry, that's not what
falling in love with me looks like.

866
00:55:49.304 --> 00:55:50.639
I... I should know.

867
00:55:50.722 --> 00:55:53.016
I see it day after day, week after week.

868
00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:54.893
Let's run it again.

869
00:55:54.977 --> 00:55:57.521
From the top!
And five, six, seven, eight.

870
00:55:57.729 --> 00:55:58.981
And one...

871
00:56:03.527 --> 00:56:06.321
Would you like
some ice cream, ma'am?

872
00:56:06.905 --> 00:56:10.075
Or should I say, Your Majesty?

873
00:56:11.118 --> 00:56:12.286
Uh...

874
00:56:12.369 --> 00:56:15.372
I just... You look like a goddess,
and, uh...

875
00:56:15.455 --> 00:56:17.416
And... and lucky for you,

876
00:56:17.541 --> 00:56:19.710
it's "free ice cream
for all goddesses" day.

877
00:56:20.335 --> 00:56:22.296
Aw.

878
00:56:34.057 --> 00:56:37.227
That's cherry cheesecake,
and I make it all myself.

879
00:56:37.311 --> 00:56:39.104
See, my truck's right over there.

880
00:56:39.605 --> 00:56:41.064
Come by anytime...

881
00:56:41.523 --> 00:56:42.899
Your Majesty.

882
00:56:45.027 --> 00:56:47.404
Ooh, that... Are you okay?

883
00:57:00.751 --> 00:57:02.586
Buster?

884
00:57:04.588 --> 00:57:06.089
You okay?

885
00:57:06.965 --> 00:57:08.925
Ash?

886
00:57:10.093 --> 00:57:11.178
Where are we?

887
00:57:12.304 --> 00:57:13.930
We're in Clay's house.

888
00:57:14.056 --> 00:57:15.474
Oh, my gosh.

889
00:57:15.557 --> 00:57:17.434
- Have you talked to him yet?
- Uh-huh.

890
00:57:17.559 --> 00:57:19.436
- You have?
- We were just discussing

891
00:57:19.519 --> 00:57:21.355
whether he'd consider
being in our show.

892
00:57:21.438 --> 00:57:22.439
What did he say?

893
00:57:22.522 --> 00:57:24.316
He said no.

894
00:57:24.650 --> 00:57:27.486
Not in a million years.

895
00:57:29.112 --> 00:57:30.739
Please, Mr. Calloway.

896
00:57:30.822 --> 00:57:32.616
Look, you don't...

897
00:57:32.699 --> 00:57:35.911
you don't realize how much
it would mean to have you in our show...

898
00:57:35.994 --> 00:57:37.454
Will you stop your yakking?

899
00:57:39.581 --> 00:57:40.791
Here.

900
00:57:40.958 --> 00:57:43.961
Your friend left this on my property.

901
00:57:50.759 --> 00:57:52.844
And I want you gone in the morning.

902
00:57:55.263 --> 00:57:58.976
And that's why they say,
"Never meet your heroes."

903
00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:02.187
Step, two, three, four.

904
00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:04.231
One, two, three, four.

905
00:58:04.314 --> 00:58:05.440
Yes!

906
00:58:07.234 --> 00:58:08.402
Whoa, mate.

907
00:58:08.527 --> 00:58:10.779
You're not ready
to be busting out these moves.

908
00:58:10.862 --> 00:58:12.698
- Sorry.
- Look at you.

909
00:58:12.823 --> 00:58:14.658
Klaus has thrown you in the deep end

910
00:58:14.783 --> 00:58:16.785
and drained out
all of your confidence like...

911
00:58:18.996 --> 00:58:20.747
Don't worry.

912
00:58:20.831 --> 00:58:22.624
We'll build up to it step-by-step.

913
00:58:22.708 --> 00:58:25.252
Just forget what Klaus told you
and go with the flow.

914
00:59:15.218 --> 00:59:16.428
Nailed it!

915
00:59:18.430 --> 00:59:20.932
Now, didn't you say
you were gonna eat your hat?

916
00:59:21.058 --> 00:59:22.267
Well, there you go.

917
00:59:22.434 --> 00:59:24.478
Mmm. Yum-yum.

918
00:59:42.871 --> 00:59:44.664
Girl, that is your fourth today.

919
00:59:44.748 --> 00:59:46.083
I know, I know.

920
00:59:46.166 --> 00:59:47.834
But I can't stop.

921
00:59:48.585 --> 00:59:50.670
It's 'cause I really want to talk to him.

922
00:59:52.255 --> 00:59:53.465
But...

923
00:59:54.674 --> 00:59:56.468
but when I get close,

924
00:59:57.552 --> 00:59:59.387
I get nervous, so...

925
01:00:01.098 --> 01:00:03.266
so I just buy another ice cream.

926
01:00:11.983 --> 01:00:15.695
Uh, honestly, this is gonna be
the greatest show I have ever made.

927
01:00:15.779 --> 01:00:16.905
Whoa!

928
01:00:16.988 --> 01:00:18.448
And when you see the sets and the...

929
01:00:18.532 --> 01:00:20.075
Turn on that tap for me.

930
01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:21.535
Tap? Uh, sure.

931
01:00:22.035 --> 01:00:23.453
So, anyway...

932
01:00:24.371 --> 01:00:25.539
Whoa!

933
01:00:29.751 --> 01:00:31.169
Oopsie-daisy.

934
01:00:31.253 --> 01:00:33.004
Moon, you okay?

935
01:00:33.839 --> 01:00:35.048
I'm okay!

936
01:00:39.344 --> 01:00:40.720
It's tea.

937
01:00:40.887 --> 01:00:42.264
You drink it.

938
01:00:42.347 --> 01:00:44.307
I promise,

939
01:00:44.391 --> 01:00:46.518
this is going to be
the most wonderful...

940
01:00:46.601 --> 01:00:48.728
I mean, fantastic show ever.

941
01:00:48.854 --> 01:00:50.063
Did you put honey in this?

942
01:00:50.147 --> 01:00:52.149
And the ending? Oh, boy.

943
01:00:52.649 --> 01:00:54.484
I mean, it's gonna end with you

944
01:00:54.985 --> 01:00:56.987
and your song...

945
01:00:57.070 --> 01:00:58.697
You don't want to do the show.

946
01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:01.783
Besides, lost my singing voice, so...

947
01:01:02.075 --> 01:01:04.369
Your voice sounds fine to me.

948
01:01:05.453 --> 01:01:06.872
This...

949
01:01:07.372 --> 01:01:10.709
This is all because
you lost your wife, isn't it?

950
01:01:10.792 --> 01:01:12.961
Okay, porcupine.

951
01:01:13.044 --> 01:01:15.005
We're not talking about my Ruby.

952
01:01:15.213 --> 01:01:18.425
Look, I know she inspired
so many of your songs...

953
01:01:18.508 --> 01:01:20.302
All of my songs.

954
01:01:20.385 --> 01:01:21.511
Right.

955
01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:26.725
I... I can't imagine what it must be like
to lose someone so special,

956
01:01:26.808 --> 01:01:31.563
but do you think this is what
Ruby would've wanted for you?

957
01:01:31.771 --> 01:01:35.567
I mean, you out here on your own

958
01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:37.736
and never singing again?

959
01:01:37.819 --> 01:01:40.238
No, you don't understand.

960
01:01:40.322 --> 01:01:43.992
There's... there's no rock star
living here anymore.

961
01:01:44.284 --> 01:01:46.286
Clay, you just need to play again.

962
01:01:46.369 --> 01:01:48.246
Your songs will bring you back.

963
01:01:48.747 --> 01:01:49.581
You can.

964
01:01:49.664 --> 01:01:51.750
- You can reconnect with...
- No, I can't!

965
01:01:52.959 --> 01:01:57.505
I haven't even heard one
of my songs in over 15 years.

966
01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:59.216
And for good reason.

967
01:02:02.427 --> 01:02:05.972
Ruby was everything.

968
01:02:07.933 --> 01:02:11.269
And I don't like honey in my tea.

969
01:02:14.522 --> 01:02:16.316
He's not gonna change his mind.

970
01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:18.150
He will.

971
01:02:18.193 --> 01:02:19.986
But you should go back.

972
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:21.780
Me? What about you?

973
01:02:22.656 --> 01:02:25.116
I just need time with him.

974
01:02:26.451 --> 01:02:28.495
I can't just leave him like this.

975
01:02:31.539 --> 01:02:32.832
<i>Ten-hut!</i>

976
01:02:33.625 --> 01:02:36.169
- Whoa.
- Welcome back, Mr. Moon, sir.

977
01:02:36.253 --> 01:02:38.004
Uh, thank you, Miss Crawly.

978
01:02:38.088 --> 01:02:39.756
Oh, and I have something for you.

979
01:02:39.923 --> 01:02:41.174
Thank you, Mr. Moon, sir.

980
01:02:41.258 --> 01:02:43.510
All right, you can ease off
the attitude now.

981
01:02:43.677 --> 01:02:45.303
Oh, oh, yes, yes.

982
01:02:45.387 --> 01:02:47.681
So, any luck with Clay Calloway?

983
01:02:47.764 --> 01:02:48.764
Shh! Not yet.

984
01:02:48.807 --> 01:02:51.142
But if anyone can convince him,
it's Ash, so...

985
01:02:51.226 --> 01:02:54.104
All right, folks, tomorrow,
we have our first run-through,

986
01:02:54.187 --> 01:02:56.314
so let's get this show
in shipshape shape.

987
01:03:40.317 --> 01:03:42.068
And cue Porsha.

988
01:03:48.241 --> 01:03:49.909
Captain's log.

989
01:03:49.993 --> 01:03:51.328
I must take care,

990
01:03:51.411 --> 01:03:55.790
for I have landed
on the Planet of War.

991
01:03:56.041 --> 01:03:59.419
<i>Ooh. Okay,
so let's just hold it right there, folks.</i>

992
01:03:59.502 --> 01:04:01.338
<i>Uh, everyone, take five.</i>

993
01:04:02.589 --> 01:04:05.383
What the heck is a captain's log, anyway?

994
01:04:05.508 --> 01:04:09.054
Um, Porsha, can I have a word?

995
01:04:09.304 --> 01:04:14.100
Porsha, you know I truly believe
that this show, it...

996
01:04:14.184 --> 01:04:16.770
it's close to being fantastic,
maybe even perfect.

997
01:04:16.936 --> 01:04:18.646
- Thank you.
- Yeah, yeah,

998
01:04:18.855 --> 01:04:21.649
but... but, see, to make it
the best it can be...

999
01:04:22.942 --> 01:04:25.320
well, I got to make some changes.

1000
01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:26.946
Uh-huh.

1001
01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:28.448
Like...

1002
01:04:30.533 --> 01:04:32.827
I have to give the lead role
back to Rosita.

1003
01:04:32.994 --> 01:04:33.870
What?

1004
01:04:33.953 --> 01:04:36.331
I'm just offering you the opportunity

1005
01:04:36.456 --> 01:04:38.458
- to switch roles with...
- You're firing me?

1006
01:04:38.583 --> 01:04:39.876
No, I... I'm not firing you.

1007
01:04:39.959 --> 01:04:42.170
Oh, wait till my dad hears
that you fired me.

1008
01:04:42.253 --> 01:04:44.422
But I'm not firing you. Please, wait!

1009
01:04:45.131 --> 01:04:47.467
Oh, my gosh.

1010
01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:49.135
You all hate me, don't you?

1011
01:04:49.427 --> 01:04:52.472
No, no, no, we don't hate you.
We all think you're terrific!

1012
01:04:52.555 --> 01:04:54.682
- Well, I don't care if you hate me.
- Please stop.

1013
01:04:54.766 --> 01:04:58.520
You and your stupid,
stupid sky-fi show

1014
01:04:58.645 --> 01:04:59.813
can go to heck!

1015
01:04:59.896 --> 01:05:01.398
Porsha, stop. Wait!

1016
01:05:03.691 --> 01:05:06.194
Oh, I am one dead koala.

1017
01:07:06.981 --> 01:07:08.816
<i>And the hottest story today:</i>

1018
01:07:09.234 --> 01:07:13.863
Porsha Crystal was reportedly
fired from her father's show.

1019
01:07:15.323 --> 01:07:17.742
He fired my daughter?

1020
01:07:18.284 --> 01:07:20.620
My daughter?

1021
01:07:20.745 --> 01:07:22.956
Would you be quiet?
You've embarrassed me enough.

1022
01:07:23.039 --> 01:07:23.873
But, Daddy...

1023
01:07:23.957 --> 01:07:27.085
Now the whole world thinks
I got a talentless loser for a daughter.

1024
01:07:27.168 --> 01:07:29.212
Take her home.

1025
01:07:30.505 --> 01:07:32.465
Bring me Moon.

1026
01:08:07.542 --> 01:08:09.544
Ash? Now is not a good...

1027
01:08:09.627 --> 01:08:11.337
<i>Moon, I've got him!</i>

1028
01:08:11.421 --> 01:08:12.964
- What?
<i>- I got Calloway!</i>

1029
01:08:13.131 --> 01:08:15.174
Here, he wants to talk to you.

1030
01:08:15.466 --> 01:08:18.344
Your friend is even
more annoying than you are.

1031
01:08:18.511 --> 01:08:19.846
Don't listen to him.

1032
01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:21.806
We're heading to Redshore right now.

1033
01:08:21.889 --> 01:08:22.890
- You are?
<i>- Yes.</i>

1034
01:08:22.974 --> 01:08:25.602
My gosh.
Okay, this is great news, seriously.

1035
01:08:25.685 --> 01:08:27.270
You may have just saved my life here.

1036
01:08:34.527 --> 01:08:35.695
Okay.

1037
01:08:35.903 --> 01:08:37.322
Here we go.

1038
01:08:37.572 --> 01:08:39.490
Mr. Moon, what have you done?

1039
01:08:39.616 --> 01:08:42.201
Mr. Crystal. Aah!
I got some great news.,

1040
01:08:42.327 --> 01:08:45.371
Clay Calloway
is on his way here right now.

1041
01:08:45.455 --> 01:08:46.623
Everybody, out.

1042
01:08:47.999 --> 01:08:50.710
Okay, I think I know
what this might be about, and I...

1043
01:08:50.793 --> 01:08:52.378
You fired Porsha.

1044
01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:54.339
No. No. I never fired her.

1045
01:08:54.631 --> 01:08:56.090
You calling her a liar?

1046
01:08:56.174 --> 01:08:58.635
No, no, no, no,
she just got it wrong, is all.

1047
01:08:58.718 --> 01:09:01.179
I was only trying to help her
do the best she could...

1048
01:09:01.262 --> 01:09:04.557
And believe me,
I... I just wanted to do the right thing.

1049
01:09:04.641 --> 01:09:06.976
The right thing to do...

1050
01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:09.062
- is what I tell you to do!
- But I did!

1051
01:09:09.354 --> 01:09:11.481
I... I delivered a great show.

1052
01:09:11.564 --> 01:09:13.232
And Ca... Calloway, he's coming.

1053
01:09:13.316 --> 01:09:15.318
No, no, no! Stop! Stop!

1054
01:09:15.401 --> 01:09:16.401
No!

1055
01:09:16.527 --> 01:09:18.279
You really think I'd let a lowlife

1056
01:09:18.363 --> 01:09:21.115
little amateur loser like you

1057
01:09:21.324 --> 01:09:22.950
humiliate me?

1058
01:09:23.076 --> 01:09:24.535
Please! Please!

1059
01:09:24.702 --> 01:09:26.621
- You made me look bad.
- No, no!

1060
01:09:26.704 --> 01:09:27.705
I didn't mean to!

1061
01:09:27.914 --> 01:09:29.123
No!

1062
01:09:29.207 --> 01:09:30.875
So I'm gonna have to let you go.

1063
01:09:31.125 --> 01:09:33.503
What? Whoa!

1064
01:09:33.586 --> 01:09:35.338
Sir. Uh, sir, sir, sir.

1065
01:09:35.421 --> 01:09:37.507
I'm... I'm so sorry, um,
so sorry to bother you,

1066
01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:40.009
but, uh, you have a live
TV appearance in just a moment,

1067
01:09:40.134 --> 01:09:43.012
so it might be better
if we just put a pin in this right now.

1068
01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:44.972
Um...

1069
01:09:48.685 --> 01:09:50.603
You... you nearly killed me.

1070
01:09:50.687 --> 01:09:52.438
And I'll finish the job later.

1071
01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:56.401
No.

1072
01:09:56.484 --> 01:09:57.694
No! No!

1073
01:09:57.777 --> 01:09:59.445
Help!

1074
01:09:59.529 --> 01:10:02.115
Help! Jerry! Anyone!

1075
01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:05.493
No. Help, please!

1076
01:10:07.245 --> 01:10:08.621
Shh!

1077
01:10:09.247 --> 01:10:11.916
You need to get out of this city
and never, ever come back.

1078
01:10:11.999 --> 01:10:13.835
Do you understand? Never.

1079
01:10:13.918 --> 01:10:15.086
Okay, okay. I understand.

1080
01:10:15.169 --> 01:10:17.755
I told you you were not cut out for this.

1081
01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:18.880
He tried to kill me.

1082
01:10:18.923 --> 01:10:20.550
Yeah, and when he finds you're gone,

1083
01:10:20.633 --> 01:10:22.635
he'll have his thugs
looking all over for you.

1084
01:10:22.719 --> 01:10:24.929
Okay. Thank you, Suki.
I'm so, so...

1085
01:10:25.096 --> 01:10:26.347
Get out of here.

1086
01:10:31.102 --> 01:10:33.563
Uh, what did you say, Mr. Moon?

1087
01:10:33.646 --> 01:10:34.981
Get out! All of you!

1088
01:10:35.064 --> 01:10:36.733
- Get out of there right now!
- Hey!

1089
01:10:36.816 --> 01:10:38.818
There's no time to explain.
Just get the cast

1090
01:10:38.901 --> 01:10:41.195
and meet me back at the hotel!

1091
01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:45.908
And we're live in five, four,

1092
01:10:45.992 --> 01:10:47.869
three, two...

1093
01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:54.083
- Jerry, go get my snacks.
- Yes, sir.

1094
01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:01.007
What a great show we have...

1095
01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:05.636
Here to discuss the drama

1096
01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:08.055
- surrounding his new show...
- Sir! Uh, sir, sir, sir.

1097
01:11:08.139 --> 01:11:10.057
- Mr. Redshore City himself...
- What?

1098
01:11:10.141 --> 01:11:12.935
Please welcome Mr. Jimmy Crystal.

1099
01:11:13.311 --> 01:11:15.271
Come on out here, Jimmy.

1100
01:11:15.354 --> 01:11:18.316
- Don't make us beg.
- Moon got out. Find him.

1101
01:11:18.399 --> 01:11:21.027
Does this guy know
how to make an entrance or what?

1102
01:11:21.152 --> 01:11:24.447
Hey, everybody!
Good to see you.

1103
01:11:24.572 --> 01:11:26.324
<i>Linda, I got some hot news for you.</i>

1104
01:11:26.407 --> 01:11:27.950
<i>You look terrific.</i>

1105
01:11:28.034 --> 01:11:29.911
<i>It is so good to see you.</i>

1106
01:11:29.994 --> 01:11:32.538
<i>Thank you.</i>

1107
01:11:32.705 --> 01:11:34.123
<i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

1108
01:11:34.248 --> 01:11:37.210
Billionaire Magazine <i>Man of the Year</i>
<i>three years in a row,</i>

1109
01:11:37.376 --> 01:11:39.337
<i>owner of the largest...</i>

1110
01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:41.506
<i>theater chain in the world...</i>

1111
01:11:52.350 --> 01:11:53.684
Buster?

1112
01:11:53.893 --> 01:11:54.977
Ash?

1113
01:11:55.770 --> 01:11:58.272
- Ash, in here!
- Buster?

1114
01:12:00.608 --> 01:12:01.984
I... I'm stuck!

1115
01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:04.028
You got to be kidding me.

1116
01:12:04.111 --> 01:12:05.111
Hold still.

1117
01:12:05.321 --> 01:12:06.906
What are you doing in there?

1118
01:12:06.989 --> 01:12:08.991
Ash, the show's off.

1119
01:12:09.075 --> 01:12:11.327
- Crystal got mad and tried to kill me.
- What?

1120
01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:16.123
I thought you were his thugs
coming here to finish me off.

1121
01:12:18.084 --> 01:12:20.211
Oh, no. It's them.

1122
01:12:20.419 --> 01:12:22.004
Shh. Pretend we're not here.

1123
01:12:23.881 --> 01:12:25.967
The first time I leave home in 15 years,

1124
01:12:26.050 --> 01:12:27.635
and what do I find?

1125
01:12:27.718 --> 01:12:30.638
The show is off,
and this guy is hiding in a suitcase.

1126
01:12:30.763 --> 01:12:32.723
No, no, don't... don't open the door.

1127
01:12:33.015 --> 01:12:35.476
No, no, no.

1128
01:12:38.896 --> 01:12:41.065
Clay Calloway.

1129
01:12:42.733 --> 01:12:44.318
I remember you.

1130
01:12:46.237 --> 01:12:47.572
<i>Miss Crawly.</i>

1131
01:12:47.864 --> 01:12:50.366
- Pew, pew. Pew.
- Miss Crawly, wake up.

1132
01:12:50.449 --> 01:12:51.659
Wha... Mm, what?

1133
01:12:51.742 --> 01:12:53.494
Wake up. We got to get out of here.

1134
01:12:53.703 --> 01:12:56.330
- Coast is clear. Let's go.
- Come on, Miss Crawly. Come on.

1135
01:12:56.414 --> 01:12:57.790
Come on. Come on.

1136
01:12:57.874 --> 01:12:59.917
We'll all feel better
when we're safe at home.

1137
01:13:00.001 --> 01:13:01.168
You sure about that?

1138
01:13:01.419 --> 01:13:03.045
'Cause I can tell you,

1139
01:13:03.129 --> 01:13:05.006
running and hiding away

1140
01:13:05.089 --> 01:13:07.300
is not all that it's cracked up to be.

1141
01:13:07.466 --> 01:13:10.386
Well, we don't have a choice.

1142
01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:15.308
Yeah, well, all these years,
I thought the same,

1143
01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:17.852
but turns out there's always a choice.

1144
01:13:18.686 --> 01:13:21.355
Just never had the guts
to make the right one.

1145
01:13:22.189 --> 01:13:23.733
Know what I mean?

1146
01:13:24.025 --> 01:13:25.693
<i>Right? A victim.</i>

1147
01:13:25.776 --> 01:13:27.361
<i>I shut down my show</i>

1148
01:13:27.528 --> 01:13:30.907
<i>'cause of a talentless little twerp
called Buster Moon.</i>

1149
01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:33.576
<i>Seriously, you should've seen
this teeny, tiny loser.</i>

1150
01:13:33.659 --> 01:13:35.578
<i>Oh, and his pathetic amateur friends...</i>

1151
01:13:35.661 --> 01:13:37.246
<i>Let's just say, whatever Podunk town</i>

1152
01:13:37.330 --> 01:13:39.373
<i>they crawled out of,
that's where they belong,</i>

1153
01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:41.792
<i>'cause it sure ain't this great city.</i>

1154
01:13:47.089 --> 01:13:48.382
No.

1155
01:13:48.674 --> 01:13:50.635
I see, Clay's right.

1156
01:13:50.718 --> 01:13:53.554
What we're trying to do here,
it takes guts.

1157
01:13:55.348 --> 01:13:56.766
Guys, wait.

1158
01:13:56.849 --> 01:13:58.935
We... we cannot
let that... that...

1159
01:13:59.018 --> 01:14:00.853
that bully steal our hopes and dreams.

1160
01:14:00.937 --> 01:14:03.230
No, no, no. We are way past
singing and dancing now.

1161
01:14:03.314 --> 01:14:05.274
Look, I... I know
this might sound crazy.

1162
01:14:05.358 --> 01:14:07.693
- If we got the theater back...
- Oh, come on.

1163
01:14:07.777 --> 01:14:09.320
- Just for one night only.
- Seriously?

1164
01:14:09.403 --> 01:14:13.532
It's not like we can just sneak in there
and put the show on behind Crystal's back.

1165
01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:16.410
That is exactly what we're gonna do.

1166
01:14:17.036 --> 01:14:18.371
Yes!

1167
01:14:20.873 --> 01:14:23.167
Maybe it's, like, room service?

1168
01:14:24.502 --> 01:14:26.087
Open up or you're dead, Moon!

1169
01:14:26.170 --> 01:14:27.922
Okay, it's not room service.

1170
01:14:28.005 --> 01:14:30.591
You and your dumb friends
better not be hiding in there.

1171
01:14:30.675 --> 01:14:31.759
What are we gonna do?

1172
01:14:31.926 --> 01:14:33.469
Guys, we just got to be brave now.

1173
01:14:33.552 --> 01:14:35.304
Are you saying
we should fight these thugs?

1174
01:14:35.388 --> 01:14:36.889
No. They'll beat us to a pulp.

1175
01:14:38.307 --> 01:14:41.018
We're gonna put this show on
whether Crystal likes it or not.

1176
01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:44.146
But first, we're gonna jump
out that window.

1177
01:14:44.939 --> 01:14:46.023
What?

1178
01:14:46.190 --> 01:14:48.234
I'm beginning to like this guy.

1179
01:14:58.077 --> 01:15:00.955
Security. Yeah, we got nine suspects
loose on the river ride.

1180
01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:04.000
Repeat, nine suspects loose
on the river ride.

1181
01:15:04.208 --> 01:15:06.752
Hang on, everybody.

1182
01:15:06.961 --> 01:15:10.047
Uh, this is pool security.
I don't see anyone here. Over.

1183
01:15:10.256 --> 01:15:11.549
There!

1184
01:15:11.716 --> 01:15:13.676
They're heading east
through the back lot!

1185
01:15:13.759 --> 01:15:14.885
Go, go, go, go, go.

1186
01:15:15.678 --> 01:15:19.015
Oh, I wish I didn't have...
such teeny, tiny legs!

1187
01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:32.111
Thank you, Linda. Thank you.

1188
01:15:32.194 --> 01:15:33.738
Thanks, everybody.

1189
01:15:35.948 --> 01:15:37.116
Well?

1190
01:15:37.199 --> 01:15:39.869
No sign of 'em, sir.
We think they might have split town.

1191
01:15:51.589 --> 01:15:53.466
No one is supposed to be in here.

1192
01:15:54.467 --> 01:15:56.844
Uh, who are you?

1193
01:15:57.136 --> 01:15:58.763
We're the night cleaners.

1194
01:15:58.846 --> 01:16:00.181
Oh, I see.

1195
01:16:00.347 --> 01:16:02.558
Well, we don't need
any cleaning right now,

1196
01:16:02.641 --> 01:16:06.062
but it'd be better
if you didn't leave, so...

1197
01:16:06.187 --> 01:16:08.939
Mm, I don't suppose any of you
can tap-dance, huh?

1198
01:16:09.023 --> 01:16:10.775
Huh.

1199
01:16:10.858 --> 01:16:12.318
Well, let's move it, folks.

1200
01:16:17.114 --> 01:16:19.450
Here, Rosita. It's your role.

1201
01:16:22.912 --> 01:16:25.414
Miss Crawly, let's see if we can
get us a new green alien.

1202
01:16:25.498 --> 01:16:26.916
Yes, sir, Mr. Moon, sir.

1203
01:16:31.879 --> 01:16:33.631
<i>Rise and shine, sweetheart!</i>

1204
01:16:35.966 --> 01:16:37.593
Hey! You made it!

1205
01:16:37.676 --> 01:16:40.971
Yeah, well, uh, maybe
I overreacted a little before.

1206
01:16:41.055 --> 01:16:43.557
A little? You were, like,
a total drama queen back there.

1207
01:16:43.641 --> 01:16:44.934
Okay, we're all good now.

1208
01:16:45.017 --> 01:16:47.478
Wow, my dad's gonna flip
when he finds out about us.

1209
01:16:47.561 --> 01:16:49.438
- We're safe for now, but listen...
- Safe?

1210
01:16:49.688 --> 01:16:52.441
Uh, no. None of us are safe.

1211
01:16:52.525 --> 01:16:55.361
Mr. Moon, I know someone
who can protect us.

1212
01:16:55.486 --> 01:16:58.906
Right. Mm-hm. Yeah. Yeah.

1213
01:16:58.989 --> 01:17:00.449
Protection?

1214
01:17:00.533 --> 01:17:03.285
Say no more, son. We're on our way.

1215
01:17:34.358 --> 01:17:35.818
Good night, Porsha.

1216
01:17:38.154 --> 01:17:40.030
All right, be that way. I don't care.

1217
01:17:40.114 --> 01:17:41.824
Spoiled little brat.

1218
01:17:42.283 --> 01:17:44.535
All right, time to get us an audience.

1219
01:17:44.618 --> 01:17:47.955
Wait. Moon, as soon as you
start inviting folks in here,

1220
01:17:48.038 --> 01:17:50.291
hotel security will just shut
us down, right?

1221
01:17:50.457 --> 01:17:52.793
Oh, it's okay.
Rosita's got that covered.

1222
01:17:54.628 --> 01:17:57.006
Norman, release the piglets.

1223
01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:10.102
Hey, no!

1224
01:18:13.439 --> 01:18:17.359
All security, we have a situation
on floor 17.

1225
01:18:17.693 --> 01:18:20.613
Repeat, all security to floor 17.

1226
01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:24.533
This is the best day
of my life, Daddy! Whoo!

1227
01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:28.204
Repeat, everybody to floor 17!

1228
01:18:30.206 --> 01:18:32.374
<i>Wait, uh, is it on?</i>

1229
01:18:32.458 --> 01:18:34.001
<i>- It's on now.
- Now?</i>

1230
01:18:34.084 --> 01:18:35.524
<i>- Yes, now.
- Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.</i>

1231
01:18:35.586 --> 01:18:36.962
<i>Before I blah, blah... Yeah, okay.</i>

1232
01:18:37.046 --> 01:18:38.422
<i>Good evening.</i>

1233
01:18:38.505 --> 01:18:40.633
<i>Uh, my name is Buster Moon,</i>

1234
01:18:40.925 --> 01:18:43.135
<i>and it is my great pleasure
to present to you,</i>

1235
01:18:43.219 --> 01:18:45.346
<i>for one night only
in the Crystal Tower Theater...</i>

1236
01:18:45.429 --> 01:18:47.139
Mr. Crystal's office.

1237
01:18:47.223 --> 01:18:48.599
This is Jerry speaking.

1238
01:18:49.141 --> 01:18:52.228
<i>a brand-new show</i>
<i>called</i> Out of This World.

1239
01:18:52.394 --> 01:18:55.147
<i>A musical space odyssey
featuring the return</i>

1240
01:18:55.231 --> 01:18:58.067
<i>of the legendary Clay Calloway.</i>

1241
01:18:58.484 --> 01:19:01.403
<i>That's right, Clay Calloway.</i>

1242
01:19:01.487 --> 01:19:04.740
<i>And what's more,
this show is completely free,</i>

1243
01:19:04.865 --> 01:19:07.368

1244
01:19:07.451 --> 01:19:10.537
<i>The journey of a lifetime

1245
01:19:10.829 --> 01:19:13.040
All right, folks, we all set back here?

1246
01:19:13.916 --> 01:19:15.251
There he is!

1247
01:19:15.376 --> 01:19:17.044
Dad.

1248
01:19:17.127 --> 01:19:18.963
- Come here.
- What are you wearing?

1249
01:19:19.046 --> 01:19:22.466
Oh, well, we're still doing
our community service, ain't we, lads?

1250
01:19:22.549 --> 01:19:23.549
- Yeah.
- That's right.

1251
01:19:23.759 --> 01:19:25.678
Oh, my gosh. He's here.

1252
01:19:25.928 --> 01:19:27.888
- Crystal's here?
- No.

1253
01:19:28.389 --> 01:19:29.723
My ice cream guy.

1254
01:19:30.099 --> 01:19:31.976
And he's sitting in the front row.

1255
01:19:32.184 --> 01:19:34.561
- Mr. Crystal! Mr. Crystal!
- Aah! Jerry!

1256
01:19:34.645 --> 01:19:36.480
- Mr. Crystal, wake up.
- I tried to stop him.

1257
01:19:36.563 --> 01:19:38.399
I'm so sorry to wake you up.
It's Moon.

1258
01:19:38.482 --> 01:19:40.943
He's taken over the theater,
and he's putting on a show.

1259
01:19:41.026 --> 01:19:43.028
He's what?

1260
01:19:52.204 --> 01:19:53.831
Okay, this is it, guys. You ready?

1261
01:19:53.914 --> 01:19:55.582
Oh, my gosh.
Are we really doing this?

1262
01:19:55.666 --> 01:19:57.042
You better believe it.

1263
01:19:57.126 --> 01:19:59.378
Yeah, big-time, baby!

1264
01:19:59.461 --> 01:20:00.587
Remember...

1265
01:20:00.671 --> 01:20:04.717
There's only one way
left to go, and that's up!

1266
01:20:04.842 --> 01:20:06.510
- Yeah! -
- Let's do it! Come on!

1267
01:20:06.593 --> 01:20:09.263
Gunter robot
activating piggy power.

1268
01:20:09.388 --> 01:20:11.348
- Beep-beep, boop-boop.
- Playback!

1269
01:20:16.395 --> 01:20:20.316
<i>All creatures great and small,</i>

1270
01:20:21.025 --> 01:20:24.028
<i>welcome to outer space.</i>

1271
01:20:33.829 --> 01:20:36.165
My name is Captain Rosita.

1272
01:20:36.999 --> 01:20:40.753
My mission: to find and rescue
a space explorer

1273
01:20:40.836 --> 01:20:43.589
who mysteriously
went missing long ago.

1274
01:20:44.256 --> 01:20:46.800
Captain, I am picking up
his signal.

1275
01:20:47.509 --> 01:20:49.762
Excellent. But from which planet?

1276
01:20:49.845 --> 01:20:51.847
I see four of them ahead.

1277
01:20:52.348 --> 01:20:55.934
It is impossible to know which one
the signal is, like, coming from.

1278
01:20:56.018 --> 01:20:57.102
I see.

1279
01:20:57.436 --> 01:20:59.188
Then I'll have to explore them all.

1280
01:20:59.313 --> 01:21:00.731
Take us down.

1281
01:21:01.607 --> 01:21:02.983
You've got this, big guy.

1282
01:21:03.067 --> 01:21:05.277
Remember what I said...
Just go with the flow.

1283
01:21:07.112 --> 01:21:09.782
Mission report.
I must take care,

1284
01:21:10.032 --> 01:21:13.285
for I have landed on the Planet of War.

1285
01:21:49.738 --> 01:21:51.115
That's my boy.

1286
01:22:29.611 --> 01:22:31.530
Yeah!

1287
01:22:33.282 --> 01:22:34.658
Give me that!

1288
01:22:34.741 --> 01:22:36.618
- And your costume. Now!
- Wait, what?

1289
01:22:36.702 --> 01:22:37.953
Take it off now!

1290
01:22:44.877 --> 01:22:46.420
We'll be at the theater soon.

1291
01:22:46.503 --> 01:22:48.922
I don't want to be there soon.
I want to be there now.

1292
01:22:49.006 --> 01:22:50.549
- We want to be there now.
- Yes, sir.

1293
01:23:35.802 --> 01:23:39.932
You see?
You will never be great, Johnny.

1294
01:23:44.478 --> 01:23:46.146
Oh, come on.

1295
01:24:20.138 --> 01:24:21.223
Yeah, that's more like it.

1296
01:24:49.001 --> 01:24:51.128
<i>This is Barry. Come in. Over.</i>

1297
01:24:51.211 --> 01:24:52.462
Yeah, go ahead, Barry.

1298
01:24:52.588 --> 01:24:56.300
Crystal's on site.
Repeat, Crystal is on site. Over.

1299
01:24:56.550 --> 01:24:58.051
Roger that.

1300
01:24:58.135 --> 01:25:00.429
Right, let's go to work.

1301
01:25:00.887 --> 01:25:02.431
Mission report.

1302
01:25:02.514 --> 01:25:04.600
My search takes me
to the second planet,

1303
01:25:04.933 --> 01:25:06.268
the Planet of Joy.

1304
01:25:06.351 --> 01:25:07.644
All right. Here we go, Porsha.

1305
01:25:07.853 --> 01:25:10.314
<i>Time to show the world
what you're really made of.</i>

1306
01:25:39.384 --> 01:25:41.178
Who the are you?
Where's my security?

1307
01:25:41.261 --> 01:25:43.055
We're security now, mate.

1308
01:25:43.138 --> 01:25:44.681
What?

1309
01:26:16.338 --> 01:26:17.338
Porsha!

1310
01:26:19.549 --> 01:26:20.549
Get off of there!

1311
01:26:21.385 --> 01:26:22.886
Don't you make me come out there!

1312
01:26:47.411 --> 01:26:48.578
You traitor.

1313
01:26:48.662 --> 01:26:50.789
That's it, I'm coming out there!

1314
01:26:53.375 --> 01:26:55.711
Miss Crawly put some cushions
and snacks there,

1315
01:26:55.794 --> 01:26:58.130
so you should be comfortable
till the show's over.

1316
01:26:58.505 --> 01:26:59.505
You little...

1317
01:27:35.751 --> 01:27:36.960
<i>Mission report.</i>

1318
01:27:37.043 --> 01:27:39.463
<i>No sign here

1319
01:27:39.546 --> 01:27:41.131
<i>I'm moving to...</i>

1320
01:27:41.256 --> 01:27:42.924
- Ready, Gina?
- It's Meena.

1321
01:27:43.008 --> 01:27:44.885
- Wait, what is?
- Never mind.

1322
01:27:45.051 --> 01:27:46.678
Listen, find that feeling.

1323
01:27:46.762 --> 01:27:48.764
It is now or never.

1324
01:28:04.654 --> 01:28:07.240
Okay. I'm ready now.

1325
01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:48.740
Mr. Crystal, where are you?

1326
01:28:48.824 --> 01:28:51.117
I'm trapped somewhere
under the stage.

1327
01:28:51.201 --> 01:28:53.036
I'll find you, sir.

1328
01:28:53.119 --> 01:28:55.163
Mr. Crystal, I'm coming!

1329
01:30:00.604 --> 01:30:01.605
Yes!

1330
01:30:01.688 --> 01:30:04.274
I am gonna win
a ton of awards for this.

1331
01:30:08.612 --> 01:30:09.654
Hi.

1332
01:30:09.863 --> 01:30:11.323
Um, hi.

1333
01:30:11.406 --> 01:30:12.616
I'm Meena.

1334
01:30:12.699 --> 01:30:14.659
Oh. Um, Alfonso.

1335
01:30:15.285 --> 01:30:16.911
You... you were incredible.

1336
01:30:16.995 --> 01:30:18.496
So were you.

1337
01:30:18.580 --> 01:30:19.998
Um, what?

1338
01:30:20.248 --> 01:30:22.375
Oh. Uh, uh, never mind.

1339
01:30:22.459 --> 01:30:25.045
Um, want to meet up
after the show, maybe?

1340
01:30:25.211 --> 01:30:26.588
Uh, okay.

1341
01:30:27.380 --> 01:30:28.548
Okay, great. Bye.

1342
01:30:31.509 --> 01:30:33.803
Captain, we cannot land
on the last planet.

1343
01:30:33.887 --> 01:30:36.348
There is, like, a huge wormhole.

1344
01:30:36.431 --> 01:30:38.808
The ship will never make it.

1345
01:30:38.892 --> 01:30:40.477
You're right. It won't make it.

1346
01:30:41.561 --> 01:30:43.313
But I will.

1347
01:30:52.155 --> 01:30:53.365
Watch your fingers.

1348
01:31:14.636 --> 01:31:17.305
Rosita, you've got to jump.

1349
01:31:18.932 --> 01:31:20.767
Oh, honey.

1350
01:31:21.059 --> 01:31:22.352
Come on, Rosita.

1351
01:31:22.435 --> 01:31:23.978
- Look out!
- Whoa!

1352
01:31:24.062 --> 01:31:25.730
- Daddy, stop it!
- No!

1353
01:31:25.897 --> 01:31:27.899
- Mr. Moon!
- Mr. Crystal, no!

1354
01:31:29.025 --> 01:31:31.528
Well, I've got you now,
you lowlife little loser.

1355
01:31:31.695 --> 01:31:33.029
No, sir.

1356
01:31:33.113 --> 01:31:34.698
I'm not a loser.

1357
01:31:34.781 --> 01:31:36.783
We did what we came here to do.

1358
01:31:37.117 --> 01:31:40.704
And there is nothing
you can do or say to change that.

1359
01:31:45.041 --> 01:31:48.086
Oh, I can do whatever I want.

1360
01:32:26.958 --> 01:32:28.251
Aah! Whoa!

1361
01:33:14.798 --> 01:33:16.257
Woo-hoo!

1362
01:33:16.466 --> 01:33:18.468
I love you!

1363
01:33:18.551 --> 01:33:20.845
Yeah!

1364
01:33:20.929 --> 01:33:22.555
Oh, Mr. Moon, are you okay?

1365
01:33:22.639 --> 01:33:24.432
Yeah. Never better.

1366
01:33:24.516 --> 01:33:26.476
Uh, where's Ash and Clay?

1367
01:33:37.195 --> 01:33:38.696
Clay.

1368
01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:40.615
Clay, you back here?

1369
01:33:40.740 --> 01:33:41.783
We're on next.

1370
01:33:43.618 --> 01:33:45.245
You okay?

1371
01:33:45.328 --> 01:33:46.496
Uh-huh.

1372
01:33:48.122 --> 01:33:49.833
<i>Mission report.</i>

1373
01:33:50.041 --> 01:33:52.085

- Yeah!
- Yeah.

1375
01:33:54.295 --> 01:33:56.965
And arrived on the last planet.

1376
01:33:57.465 --> 01:34:00.343
The missing space explorer
must be here somewhere,

1377
01:34:00.510 --> 01:34:03.638
but there's no sign of life
on my scanner.

1378
01:34:03.847 --> 01:34:05.431
That's your cue.

1379
01:34:05.515 --> 01:34:07.684
Clay, it's time to go on.

1380
01:34:07.767 --> 01:34:10.103
But I see no signs of life.

1381
01:34:10.186 --> 01:34:12.564
Nothing but an empty cave.

1382
01:34:12.730 --> 01:34:14.315
- Clay.
- Oh, no.

1383
01:34:14.399 --> 01:34:16.526
It's okay. Just sing.

1384
01:34:16.985 --> 01:34:18.862
- Your songs will carry you.
- No.

1385
01:34:19.112 --> 01:34:21.155
- This is a mistake.
- Please.

1386
01:34:21.239 --> 01:34:23.199
It's been so long.

1387
01:34:24.284 --> 01:34:25.743
I'm not ready.

1388
01:34:25.827 --> 01:34:26.995
I'm sorry.

1389
01:34:27.412 --> 01:34:28.705
I'm not ready.

1390
01:37:37.852 --> 01:37:39.270
<i>Mission accomplished.</i>

1391
01:37:39.353 --> 01:37:40.480
<i>We're heading home.</i>

1392
01:38:01.918 --> 01:38:04.003
- Hey, Mr. Moon!
- Come on!

1393
01:38:04.087 --> 01:38:05.755
- Get out here, Moon.
- Come on out here!

1394
01:38:44.627 --> 01:38:47.547
Jimmy!

1395
01:38:48.089 --> 01:38:50.383
Oh, my gosh,
listen to that crowd.

1396
01:38:50.466 --> 01:38:52.385
You are a genius.

1397
01:38:52.510 --> 01:38:54.178
Yeah, you really are a genius, sir.

1398
01:38:55.763 --> 01:38:58.474
Yeah, you got that right, Linda.

1399
01:39:01.727 --> 01:39:03.771
<i>Thank you, thank you.</i>

1400
01:39:03.855 --> 01:39:06.232
<i>Too kind. I appreciate it, really.</i>

1401
01:39:06.315 --> 01:39:08.025
<i>I... I do.</i>

1402
01:39:08.151 --> 01:39:10.444
<i>Look, I am very proud of this show.</i>

1403
01:39:10.528 --> 01:39:13.406
<i>We did great work here. Great work.</i>

1404
01:39:13.531 --> 01:39:17.076
<i>And my good friend, Clay...
Great to have him back, right?</i>

1405
01:39:17.243 --> 01:39:19.162
<i>Yeah!</i>

1406
01:39:19.579 --> 01:39:22.999
<i>And listen, I look forward
to seeing this show run</i>

1407
01:39:23.082 --> 01:39:26.002
<i>at my theater for many,
many years to come.</i>

1408
01:39:26.794 --> 01:39:27.879
<i>Right, Moon?</i>

1409
01:39:29.755 --> 01:39:31.924
<i>Moon?</i>

1410
01:39:40.308 --> 01:39:42.560
Officers, arrest that wolf.

1411
01:39:44.896 --> 01:39:46.731
Wait! He's innocent!

1412
01:39:46.814 --> 01:39:48.065
Mr. Crystal, please!

1413
01:39:48.149 --> 01:39:49.358
I love you!

1414
01:40:57.885 --> 01:40:59.095
Stop the bus!

1415
01:41:00.346 --> 01:41:01.555
Whoa!

1416
01:41:01.639 --> 01:41:03.599
- What is it?
- What happened?

1417
01:41:03.724 --> 01:41:05.309
- What's going on?
- Ow!

1418
01:41:05.393 --> 01:41:07.436
I just got a call from The Majestic.

1419
01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:09.272
They think your show is fantastic,

1420
01:41:09.355 --> 01:41:11.607
and they want to put it on
at their theater.

1421
01:41:13.526 --> 01:41:15.736
Well, what do you say, Mr. Calloway?

1422
01:41:15.820 --> 01:41:16.988
You in?

1423
01:44:26.510 --> 01:44:27.678
Oh!
