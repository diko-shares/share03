3
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.603

6

<i>But there was no obituary...</i>

7
00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:57.029
<i>...because the day that I died...</i>

8
00:03:57.196 --> 00:04:01.242
<i>...was also the day I started to live.</i>

9
00:04:01.617 --> 00:04:03.494
<i>But that comes later.</i>

10
00:04:15.214 --> 00:04:16.590
<i>This was my life.</i>

11
00:04:16.757 --> 00:04:19.885
<i>Days blended together,
consistently ordinary...</i>

12
00:04:20.052 --> 00:04:23.597

- Happily.

19
00:04:41.198 --> 00:04:44.160
- Beau-line is magic in a bottle.
- I don't know how you get it.

Now, Beau-line doesn't
just hide the effects of aging...

29

...as the face of Hedare.

35
00:05:30.664 --> 00:05:33.751
It has been a magnificent 15 years.

36
00:05:33.918 --> 00:05:38.589

a new face to represent Beau-line.

37

- Hello.
- We got a lot of work to do.

176

First, you gotta shave those legs.

177

Second, wear that leather outfit
we got you for your birthday.

- First, it's only coffee.

- I don't know why.

wrong with Beau-line.

Would your wife crawl out on the ledge
of a building to rescue a cat?

535
00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:33.112
Maybe, if the cat was carrying a pizza.

536
00:59:47.126 --> 00:59:49.253
<font color="#ffff80">MAN:</font>
Well, there are similarities.

537
00:59:49.462 --> 00:59:53.591
- Shape of the S, harsh stroke of the R's.
- Were they written by the same person?

538
00:59:53.758 --> 00:59:56.177
Well, it's not an exact science.

539
00:59:56.427 --> 01:00:00.848
But this first one. The broad spacing
of the letters? Indicative of loneliness.

540
01:00:01.015 --> 01:00:05.060
And the O reaching out, insecure.
Handwriting of a people-pleaser.

541
01:00:05.269 --> 01:00:07.772
Now, we look at the loop of the Y.

542
01:00:07.938 --> 01:00:10.441
Very self-confident, almost angry.

543
01:00:10.608 --> 01:00:13.944
And the O, well, this person
doesn't like to play by the rules.

544
01:00:14.153 --> 01:00:16.113
- So they're different people.
- Very.

545
01:00:16.697 --> 01:00:19.241
If you put these two women
in the same room...

546
01:00:19.450 --> 01:00:21.619

662

...quit the self-tanning.

663

same day they invented the cell phone.

825
01:28:42.193 --> 01:28:45.279
I saw her standing over him.
There were claw marks all over his body.

826
01:28:45.446 --> 01:28:48.324
- But not on Slavicky's.
- Because she didn't have the time.

827
01:28:48.491 --> 01:28:50.534
She also didn't have a motive.

828
01:28:52.286 --> 01:28:54.997
- I don't know.
- What if I told you I know the truth?

829
01:28:55.331 --> 01:28:58.167
That I know who killed your husband,
I know about Beau-line.

830
01:28:58.501 --> 01:29:02.004
Why, detective, you make it sound
like I'm a suspect.

831
01:29:02.713 --> 01:29:05.341
What if I told you I had evidence?

832
01:29:07.009 --> 01:29:11.555
If you have evidence,
then how come I'm not in cuffs?

833
01:29:11.722 --> 01:29:16.018
Well, you're a smart woman,
Mrs. Hedare. Beautiful. Rich.

834
01:29:16.435 --> 01:29:18.604
I thought maybe we could
work something out.

835
01:29:18.771 --> 01:29:24.026
So this evidence... You'll make it
disappear? Pin it on the other girl?

836
01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:26.695
If that's what you want me to do.

837
01:29:27.530 --> 01:29:28.989
And you?

838
01:29:29.156 --> 01:29:32.201
- What do you want?
- You just gave me what I want.

839
01:29:32.368 --> 01:29:34.328
You just told me it was you.

840
01:29:35.371 --> 01:29:38.165
Now, why would you believe it was me?

841
01:29:39.750 --> 01:29:41.377
Because I finally trusted a friend.

842
01:29:41.544 --> 01:29:44.171
Yeah, well, your friend just got you killed.

843
01:29:44.380 --> 01:29:45.631
Ah!

844
01:29:46.131 --> 01:29:49.218
Don't be stupid, Laurel.
You don't want to kill a cop.

845
01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:51.804
I'm a woman, Lone.

846
01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:56.225
I'm used to doing all kinds
of things I don't wanna do.

847
01:29:56.559 --> 01:29:58.727
Give my regards to my husband.

848
01:30:05.234 --> 01:30:06.860
How sweet.

849
01:30:07.027 --> 01:30:09.613
Thanks. Now I can kill you both.

How is it?

852
01:30:34.888 --> 01:30:36.849
Well, there goes my jump shot.

853
01:30:37.099 --> 01:30:38.309
Listen.

854
01:30:38.642 --> 01:30:40.811
I want you to know I'm sorry.

855
01:30:40.978 --> 01:30:43.272
I should have trusted you all along.

856
01:30:43.731 --> 01:30:46.442
You're confusing me with somebody else.

857
01:30:46.775 --> 01:30:48.777
Come on, Patience.

858
01:30:53.741 --> 01:30:55.784
I'll take this side.

I can't believe I ever trusted you.

862
01:31:57.596 --> 01:32:00.891
- You're a fake.
- And what are you? A hero?

863
01:32:03.185 --> 01:32:04.603
A thief?

864

A freak?

865
01:32:12.695 --> 01:32:16.240
If you don't have an identity,
why keep it a secret?

866
01:32:17.074 --> 01:32:19.618
Because you killed me.

867
01:32:24.707 --> 01:32:27.710
It was me you flushed down the pipes.

868
01:32:30.963 --> 01:32:32.756
I'm Patience Philips.

869

- I can't be hurt.
- Beau-line.

872
01:33:11.003 --> 01:33:14.381
You stop using it
and your face disintegrates.

And if you keep using it,
skin like living marble.

You're gonna look like a cop-killer.

881
01:34:27.996 --> 01:34:32.501
You wanted to save him.
Honey, you couldn't save yourself.

882
01:34:47.349 --> 01:34:48.767
Game over.

883
01:34:49.601 --> 01:34:51.019

...once Laurel's boys start talking...

893
01:36:27.115 --> 01:36:29.910
...we'll be able to wrap up
these murder cases pretty easy.

And if Patience is back in her cell
by tomorrow morning...

that she was Catwoman.
