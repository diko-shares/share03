00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:31.668
Conspiracy to sell heroin.

186
00:12:31.709 --> 00:12:33.795
You really think this
person is trustworthy?

187
00:12:33.836 --> 00:12:35.255
- She says,
she's got information.

188
00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:36.631
- Fine. Bring her in.

189
00:12:36.673 --> 00:12:38.091
Sit her junkie ass
across from me.

190
00:12:38.132 --> 00:12:39.842
I'll pay the fucking Uber.
- Come on, John.

191
00:12:39.884 --> 00:12:40.927
People like that aren't
comfortable coming in here.

192
00:12:40.969 --> 00:12:42.053
- No shit, she's not comfortable

193
00:12:42.095 --> 00:12:43.554
- Please, it's been six weeks.

194
00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:44.931
- Bob.
- Six weeks.

195
00:12:44.973 --> 00:12:46.057
We haven't gotten anywhere.
- Bob!

196
00:12:46.099 --> 00:12:47.433
We're doing everything we can.

197
00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:48.643
I've let you take all the files

198
00:12:48.685 --> 00:12:49.852
and we run every lead, no matter

199
00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:50.937
Haven't I?

200
00:12:50.979 --> 00:12:52.772
It's the right thing to do,

201
00:12:52.814 --> 00:12:53.773
and I wouldn't have it any other
way if I was in your shoes.

202
00:12:53.815 --> 00:12:55.316
- Wait, this is a lead.

203
00:12:55.358 --> 00:12:56.693
- But this type of bitch
knows all the angles.

204
00:12:56.734 --> 00:12:58.319
And you're way out
of your league.

205
00:12:58.361 --> 00:13:00.071
Look, it'd be another thing

206
00:13:00.113 --> 00:13:02.282
if you were an experienced
investigator but [scoffs].

207
00:13:02.323 --> 00:13:03.157
- But what?

208
00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:07.078
Go on, say it.

209
00:13:08.705 --> 00:13:10.498
- You're a desk cowboy, Bob.

210
00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:11.666
A seat warmer.

211
00:13:13.042 --> 00:13:15.586
I'm sorry. You want
the truth, there it is.

212
00:13:18.006 --> 00:13:18.923
- Yes, sir.

213
00:13:19.966 --> 00:13:21.926
[door clicking]

214
00:13:27.098 --> 00:13:29.350
- You want coffee?

215
00:13:29.392 --> 00:13:30.768
- Yes, thanks. Black.

216
00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:33.730
[thunder rumbling]

217
00:13:33.771 --> 00:13:35.732
- I would offer you a beer,
but I'll be on the wagon

218
00:13:35.773 --> 00:13:38.901
for the next 40 or 50 years.

[thunder rumbling]

221
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:50.747
- I believe this was
a cult murder.

222
00:13:52.123 --> 00:13:55.877
Not a robbery or any of the
crap you read in the paper.

223
00:13:55.918 --> 00:13:57.920
I have photos from that night.

224
00:13:57.962 --> 00:13:59.088
You could take a look at them

225
00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:01.090
and tell me what you think.

226
00:14:03.092 --> 00:14:03.843
- Okay.

227
00:14:23.071 --> 00:14:25.114
Was Gabi into drugs?

228
00:14:25.156 --> 00:14:26.449
- No.

229
00:14:26.491 --> 00:14:27.658
- Are you sure?

230
00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:28.576
- I'm sure.

231
00:14:28.618 --> 00:14:29.911
I know my daughter.

232
00:14:31.371 --> 00:14:33.998
- Her friends into
satanic shit of any kind?

233
00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:34.916
- Satanic?

234
00:14:36.459 --> 00:14:38.044
She's 14 years old.

235
00:14:38.086 --> 00:14:40.880
She look like she hangs
with that kind of crowd?

236
00:14:40.922 --> 00:14:43.007
Look, we live in a small
Christian community.

237
00:14:43.049 --> 00:14:47.095
We don't have much in the
way of deviant behavior.

238
00:14:47.136 --> 00:14:48.930
[coffee slurping]

239
00:14:50.139 --> 00:14:54.352
- We all came from
family-orientated communities.

240
00:14:54.394 --> 00:14:55.144
Even me.

[folder thudding]

242
00:15:24.674 --> 00:15:26.926
Was this man a drug addict?

243
00:15:29.095 --> 00:15:30.930
This is a syringe mark.

244
00:15:31.639 --> 00:15:32.390
- Is it?

245
00:15:33.015 --> 00:15:34.392
What about this?

246
00:15:36.853 --> 00:15:39.147
[Sam breathing heavily]

247
00:15:40.022 --> 00:15:42.191
- You're crossing over.

248
00:15:43.151 --> 00:15:43.901
- Judgement.

[Case] The 20th enigma

251
00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:51.033
- The angel signaling...
- Judgement.

252
00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:53.369
What do you know about it?

253
00:15:53.411 --> 00:15:54.328
- Was he injected
with a paralytic?

254
00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:55.246
- [Bob] What do you know?

255
00:15:55.288 --> 00:15:56.622
[Sam whimpering]

256
00:15:57.373 --> 00:15:59.041
Case?
[Case groaning]

257
00:15:59.083 --> 00:16:00.668
- No, no.
- I need to think.

258
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:02.003
- You gotta tell me
what you know.

259
00:16:02.044 --> 00:16:02.962
- No, I can't.

260
00:16:03.004 --> 00:16:03.963
[door slamming]

261
00:16:04.005 --> 00:16:05.006
- Case?

262
00:16:05.047 --> 00:16:05.923
- No.

263
00:16:05.965 --> 00:16:07.467
- Case? Case, wait.

264
00:16:07.508 --> 00:16:08.885
- No, please.
I just need you to go away.

265
00:16:08.926 --> 00:16:10.386
- You have to tell me
what you know.

266
00:16:10.428 --> 00:16:11.762
- You have to tell me.
- What's going on?

267
00:16:11.804 --> 00:16:13.139
- I lost my wife.
I lost my daughter.

268
00:16:13.181 --> 00:16:14.557
[Case screaming]
Tell me what you know!

269
00:16:14.599 --> 00:16:15.933
- That's enough, Mr. Hightower.

270
00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:20.897
- [Case] I'm leaving.

271
00:16:21.647 --> 00:16:22.273
- What'd you say?

272
00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:25.318
I didn't hear you.

273
00:16:27.195 --> 00:16:28.154
You're what?

274
00:16:31.616 --> 00:16:33.075
- I said, I'm leaving.

275
00:16:33.117 --> 00:16:34.702
- Oh yeah.

276
00:16:34.744 --> 00:16:36.871
That's what I, uh, that's
what I thought you said.

Cyrus, Cyrus, she doesn't...

[Cyrus] Anyone else wanna leave?

284

Huh?

00:16:54.222 --> 00:16:55.139
What about you, bitch?

286
00:16:55.181 --> 00:16:56.641
You want to try me again?

287
00:16:56.682 --> 00:16:58.643

But be careful.
There ain't no turning back.

302

Hey, it's me.

308
00:18:56.427 --> 00:18:58.929
You're not gonna shoot me,
are you?

309
00:19:00.222 --> 00:19:02.767
- I wasn't expecting anyone.

310
00:19:02.808 --> 00:19:04.018
What do you want?

311
00:19:05.936 --> 00:19:08.272
- I think I know
who took your daughter.

312
00:19:08.314 --> 00:19:10.691
And I'm betting she's alive.

313
00:19:10.733 --> 00:19:12.151
- Yeah?

314
00:19:12.193 --> 00:19:12.902
- Yeah.

315
00:19:14.111 --> 00:19:16.530
The paralytic, the card.

316
00:19:16.572 --> 00:19:18.449
I know this crew's handiwork.

317
00:19:18.491 --> 00:19:19.659
- How?

318
00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:21.410
- Personal experience.

319
00:19:24.455 --> 00:19:25.915
I used to be one.

320
00:19:28.084 --> 00:19:30.378
- And you think Gabi's alive?

321
00:19:30.419 --> 00:19:31.170
- I do.

322
00:19:32.088 --> 00:19:33.047
- All right.

323
00:19:34.882 --> 00:19:36.717
Well, I'm gonna need
a sworn statement.

324
00:19:36.759 --> 00:19:38.678
And that means names,
descriptions

325
00:19:38.719 --> 00:19:42.264
of everyone involved.
- [sighs] Slow down, Bob.

326
00:19:42.306 --> 00:19:44.725
If you think you're going to
track them down with the cops

327
00:19:44.767 --> 00:19:46.519
or even the FBI,
you can forget about it.

328
00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:47.311
- Forget about it?

329
00:19:47.353 --> 00:19:48.896
- Yeah.

330
00:19:48.938 --> 00:19:51.774
These are the followers
of the Left Handed Path.

331
00:19:51.816 --> 00:19:53.734
The word of the Devil. What?

332
00:19:53.776 --> 00:19:55.111
You think you can just
write down an address

333
00:19:55.152 --> 00:19:57.238
and go round 'em up?

334
00:19:57.279 --> 00:19:59.573
You won't even get close.

335
00:19:59.615 --> 00:20:00.866
And as soon as they see a bunch

336
00:20:00.908 --> 00:20:02.743
of dumb shit cops
sniffing around

337
00:20:02.785 --> 00:20:04.704
the first thing Cyrus'll do is
slit your daughter's throat.

338
00:20:04.745 --> 00:20:05.871
And drink her blood.
- Don't fucking say that.

339
00:20:05.913 --> 00:20:07.998
- I know that it's hard.

340
00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.625
I know that.

341
00:20:09.667 --> 00:20:12.628
But you gotta hear me on this,
okay?

342
00:20:14.004 --> 00:20:15.631
Forget about the authorities
tracking your daughter down.

343
00:20:15.673 --> 00:20:17.508
It ain't gonna happen.

344
00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:19.051
If you want her back,

345
00:20:19.093 --> 00:20:21.762
you gotta get her yourself.

346
00:20:21.804 --> 00:20:23.013
And lose the Boy Scout uniform.

347
00:20:23.055 --> 00:20:24.098
- All right, yeah.

348
00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:25.766
What else?

349
00:20:25.808 --> 00:20:27.017
- Get as much cash as you
can and a truck that runs.

350
00:20:27.059 --> 00:20:28.728
- Yeah, I got one.

351
00:20:28.769 --> 00:20:30.896
- Okay, good, 'cause you and
me are going on the road.

352
00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.566
- We are?

353
00:20:33.607 --> 00:20:35.192
- [Case] Yeah, you and me, Bob.

354
00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:36.986
I'll be back bright and early.

355
00:20:37.027 --> 00:20:39.363
- I don't understand.
Where do you fit in?

356
00:20:41.157 --> 00:20:44.243
- You think that
you can do this alone?

357
00:20:44.285 --> 00:20:47.246
No offense, but you don't
send out sheep to hunt wolves.

358
00:20:58.466 --> 00:21:00.342
- [Arthur] We should reconsider.

359
00:21:01.802 --> 00:21:03.137
This is reckless, son.
And dangerous.

360
00:21:03.179 --> 00:21:04.847
- Just leave it alone, Arthur.

361
00:21:04.889 --> 00:21:06.682
I've made my decision.
I'll live with the consequences.

362
00:21:06.724 --> 00:21:08.851
- She's such a tramped
out excuse of a thing.

363
00:21:08.893 --> 00:21:10.603
I wouldn't put my faith in that.

364
00:21:10.644 --> 00:21:13.147
- I put my faith in God.
Her, I'm traveling with.

365
00:21:13.189 --> 00:21:14.940
- [Arthur] How do you know
she won't sell you out?

366
00:21:14.982 --> 00:21:16.525
- I don't.

367
00:21:16.567 --> 00:21:17.610
- [Arthur] How do you
know she won't rob ya?

368
00:21:17.651 --> 00:21:19.153
- I'm dying inside, Arthur.

369
00:21:19.195 --> 00:21:20.613
Do you understand?

370
00:21:20.654 --> 00:21:22.948
A little bit every day,
but I'm dying.

371
00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:24.742
I might be stupid,
but I'm going.

372
00:21:29.121 --> 00:21:30.498
- Give me the keys, I'll drive.

373
00:21:33.167 --> 00:21:35.211
[keys jingling]

374
00:21:45.054 --> 00:21:46.931
[engine starting]

375
00:21:49.141 --> 00:21:51.185
- I want you to know
something, miss.

376
00:21:51.227 --> 00:21:53.604
If anything happens to
this man over there,

377
00:21:53.646 --> 00:21:57.149
there is nothing you can say
or do to save your ass from me.

378
00:21:58.067 --> 00:21:59.527
We understand each other?

379
00:21:59.568 --> 00:22:02.905
- Absolutely. And you know what?

380
00:22:02.947 --> 00:22:04.865
I'm blown away.

381
00:22:04.907 --> 00:22:06.826
As a matter of fact,

382
00:22:06.867 --> 00:22:09.328
I'm a little wet
between my legs.

383
00:22:16.043 --> 00:22:16.919
- [Arthur] Be careful.

384
00:22:16.961 --> 00:22:19.046
[engine humming]

385
00:22:32.017 --> 00:22:33.227
- What?

386
00:22:33.269 --> 00:22:35.104
- Nothing.

387
00:22:35.145 --> 00:22:37.398
Just thinking, maybe if you'd
had a stronger moral compass

388
00:22:37.439 --> 00:22:38.691
as a child,

389
00:22:38.732 --> 00:22:40.317
like a religious foundation,

390
00:22:40.359 --> 00:22:42.361
that you'd possibly be
better equipped to deal

391
00:22:42.403 --> 00:22:43.654
with what happened to you.

392
00:22:43.696 --> 00:22:44.989
- You fucking kidding?

393
00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:46.782
- [Bob] Well, think about it.

394
00:22:46.824 --> 00:22:50.160
- I got snatched, asshole,
just like your little girl.

395
00:22:50.202 --> 00:22:53.706
Right out from underneath my
mother's nose when I was 11.

396
00:22:53.747 --> 00:22:55.666
Ain't got nothing to do
with religion.

397
00:22:55.708 --> 00:22:57.042
- I'm sorry.

398
00:22:57.084 --> 00:22:58.085
Like I said,
I don't mean to judge.

399
00:22:58.127 --> 00:22:59.920
- Yeah, well, too late.

400
00:23:02.047 --> 00:23:04.174
[western music]

401
00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:08.387
- Half an hour. I mean it.

402
00:23:08.429 --> 00:23:10.180
I want her back in pretty much
the same shape I left her in.

403
00:23:10.222 --> 00:23:11.390
- Yeah. Yeah.

404
00:23:11.432 --> 00:23:12.892
[Wood] You hear me?

405
00:23:12.933 --> 00:23:14.018
[Trucker] Don't fucking
worry about it.

406
00:23:14.059 --> 00:23:15.352
[door shuts]

407
00:23:24.111 --> 00:23:26.280
[Wife] Oh, sweet Jesus.

408
00:23:26.322 --> 00:23:27.907
Come here, baby girl.

409
00:23:30.868 --> 00:23:33.704
- What's your name?
- Case.

410
00:23:34.121 --> 00:23:35.289
Case.

411
00:23:36.165 --> 00:23:39.585
Oh, you're perfect. Just perfect

412
00:23:40.461 --> 00:23:43.631
Whoo! Bubba, what you think?

413
00:23:43.672 --> 00:23:47.968
- [chuckles] Yeah, baby.

414
00:23:50.721 --> 00:23:54.016
Reminds me of
our own little girl.

415
00:23:58.354 --> 00:24:00.564
This is gonna be fun.

416
00:24:27.633 --> 00:24:30.052
[dogs barking]

417
00:24:30.094 --> 00:24:31.845
- Hi, come here.

418
00:24:32.846 --> 00:24:36.350
Hi. Hi. Oh, gotcha.

419
00:24:37.434 --> 00:24:41.021
[Ferryman]
Yeah, they remember you.

420
00:24:41.063 --> 00:24:42.523
- Ferryman.

421
00:24:42.564 --> 00:24:43.774
- You, you gonna give them
all the love?

422
00:24:43.816 --> 00:24:45.275
Come on, now.
[Case squeals]

423
00:24:45.317 --> 00:24:47.569
Come on, now. Come on, now.

424
00:24:51.073 --> 00:24:52.032
Look at you.

425
00:24:53.367 --> 00:24:54.702
Glad to see you're amongst
the living.

426
00:24:54.743 --> 00:24:57.079
- That's me,
little miss sunshine.

427
00:24:57.121 --> 00:24:58.330
- So, who's that over there?

428
00:24:58.372 --> 00:25:00.040
- Oh, that's Bob.

429
00:25:00.082 --> 00:25:02.668
His last name's whatever
you put on his new ID.

430
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:04.253
- Okay, Mr. Bob Whatever.

431
00:25:04.294 --> 00:25:05.838
- You got that fucking
armor for me, or what?

432
00:25:05.879 --> 00:25:08.132
- I got the whole store
over there for you.

433
00:25:08.173 --> 00:25:10.634
Hey, how you doing, Robert?

434
00:25:10.676 --> 00:25:11.427
Hey.

435
00:25:13.846 --> 00:25:15.848
Should we start this ID?

436
00:25:15.889 --> 00:25:17.266
- No.

437
00:25:17.307 --> 00:25:20.436
Decal work first.
I want shit with bite.

438
00:25:20.477 --> 00:25:21.770
- With that pasty white skin,

439
00:25:21.812 --> 00:25:23.939
this ink gonna look real nice.

440
00:25:23.981 --> 00:25:25.399
- I thought we were here for gun

441
00:25:25.441 --> 00:25:26.900
You didn't say anything
about tattoos.

442
00:25:26.942 --> 00:25:27.901
- Yeah, well.

443
00:25:27.943 --> 00:25:29.153
- Yeah, well, what?

444
00:25:29.194 --> 00:25:30.654
- Bob, imagine if I showed up

445
00:25:30.696 --> 00:25:32.656
at your little church
looking like this.

446
00:25:32.698 --> 00:25:34.575
You think I'd get
a couple stares?

447
00:25:34.616 --> 00:25:36.160
Well, you're about to show up

448
00:25:36.201 --> 00:25:37.703
to a whole different type
of church, my church.

449
00:25:37.745 --> 00:25:39.747
And believe me, it's
just as bigoted as yours.

450
00:25:39.788 --> 00:25:41.331
- Why didn't you tell me before?

451
00:25:41.373 --> 00:25:42.666
- I don't like discussing
things more than once.

452
00:25:42.708 --> 00:25:44.126
- I don't like surprises.

453
00:25:44.168 --> 00:25:45.461
- Then don't be surprised
by anything.

454
00:25:45.502 --> 00:25:46.795
- Well, sorry.

455
00:25:46.837 --> 00:25:49.048
I'm not comfortable with it.

456
00:25:49.089 --> 00:25:50.049
- Okay then.

457
00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:53.886
You can just pull the plug
right now, go our separate ways.

458
00:25:53.927 --> 00:25:56.638
Last time I checked,
I was doing you a favor.

459
00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:57.848
- Hey Bee-Dub,

460
00:25:59.391 --> 00:26:00.184

Mm-hmm, good one now.

463
00:26:05.939 --> 00:26:07.357
What you want?

464
00:26:07.399 --> 00:26:10.152
You want cursive? Hieroglyphics?

465
00:26:10.194 --> 00:26:11.153
- Just don't go crazy.

466
00:26:11.195 --> 00:26:12.112
- All right.

468

So, what do you think,
Bob Whater?

470
00:26:22.664 --> 00:26:24.041
- It's good.

471
00:26:24.083 --> 00:26:25.125
- Good?

472
00:26:25.167 --> 00:26:26.710
That's some genuine, stone cold,

473

Left Handed,
black magic shit right there.

00:26:29.505 --> 00:26:31.006
It's perfect.

475
00:26:31.048 --> 00:26:32.966
See, you gotta understand,

476
00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:37.179
great tattoo art doesn't
come from bullshit stencils

477
00:26:37.221 --> 00:26:39.348
like you see in those
dick shop windows.

478
00:26:39.389 --> 00:26:43.393
It has to be drawn
to fit the skin.

479
00:26:43.435 --> 00:26:44.561
So the skin becomes
the flesh

480
00:26:44.603 --> 00:26:46.021
and the flesh becomes it.

481
00:26:46.063 --> 00:26:48.148
It's like a marriage.

482
00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:50.067

boring you to death?

483
00:26:50.109 --> 00:26:52.111
- He's working on it.

484
00:26:52.152 --> 00:26:53.445
- Gotta use the head.
Mind if I inside?

485
00:26:53.487 --> 00:26:55.322
- You know where it is.

486
00:26:55.364 --> 00:26:56.740
What am I working on?

Mm-hmm.

Okay.

Yang's all out.

not my bullshit.

He's the one
who throws the coins.

He decides his own destiny.

I'm just here to
report the facts.

- It's not mumbo jumbo.

508
00:28:05.893 --> 00:28:07.477
It's synchronicity.

I don't ask the questions.
I don't answer 'em.

Time will tell us all of that.

511
00:28:11.398 --> 00:28:13.317
The coins don't lie.

906
00:48:54.807 --> 00:48:57.101

for a re-union.

a little bit of dope,

01:21:35.099 --> 01:21:37.976
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1250
01:21:47.528 --> 01:21:50.364
- You know something,
don't you?

1251
01:21:52.032 --> 01:21:54.910
Is my daughter dead?
Did they kill her?

1252
01:21:57.162 --> 01:22:00.124
I don't know. They could have.

1253
01:22:25.524 --> 01:22:28.444
- It's a death rite.
- What?

1254
01:22:30.112 --> 01:22:33.031
- They bring children here.

1255
01:22:39.329 --> 01:22:42.249
Drug them, rape them.

1256
01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:46.086
In the end, they're killed.

1257
01:22:48.130 --> 01:22:51.049
- Goddamnit! God fucking damnit!

1258
01:22:52.217 --> 01:22:54.261
- Not all, but mostly all.

1259
01:22:54.303 --> 01:22:56.305
They keep some like me.

1260
01:22:56.346 --> 01:22:57.473
- No!

1261
01:22:57.514 --> 01:22:58.682
We gotta get out of here, okay?

1262
01:22:58.724 --> 01:23:00.434
- No, hold on. Hold on.

1263
01:23:00.476 --> 01:23:01.977
What about that dope?

1264
01:23:02.019 --> 01:23:04.521
That shit Cyrus had to
deliver to Errol.

1265
01:23:04.563 --> 01:23:06.773
Could it be here? Is it possible

1266
01:23:06.815 --> 01:23:09.359
- We can't look for it.
We don't have time.

1267
01:23:09.401 --> 01:23:11.320
- Don't matter.

1268
01:23:12.362 --> 01:23:14.907
Let's send Cyrus a message.

1269
01:23:15.866 --> 01:23:17.910
[indistinct chattering]

1270
01:23:41.975 --> 01:23:43.977
- Headcase.

1271
01:23:46.188 --> 01:23:48.106
- Oh, yeah?

1272
01:23:49.233 --> 01:23:50.776
How do you know?

1273
01:23:50.817 --> 01:23:53.737
- I saw her less
than 24 hours ago.

1274
01:23:53.779 --> 01:23:56.240
She wanted me to
send you a message.

1275
01:23:56.281 --> 01:23:58.617
- That fucking cunt's got
nine lives.

1276
01:23:58.659 --> 01:24:00.452
- Go on.

1277
01:24:00.494 --> 01:24:03.747
- Says they took all the product
you moved across the border.

1278
01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:06.833
- They did, huh?
- Yeah.

1279
01:24:06.875 --> 01:24:08.877
- She said that?
- Yeah.

1280
01:24:08.919 --> 01:24:11.046
Her and the doorstop.

1281
01:24:11.088 --> 01:24:13.298
Says that she took it
out of the house.

1282
01:24:13.340 --> 01:24:16.260
But um, did they?

1283
01:24:18.428 --> 01:24:20.347
Did they get that?

1284
01:24:20.389 --> 01:24:22.099
Did you put it in the house?

1285
01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:23.684
You couldn't have
put it in the house.

1286
01:24:23.725 --> 01:24:26.520
Be a mad move.
And you don't make bad moves.

1287
01:24:26.562 --> 01:24:29.481
I mean, you could do
bad things, but...

1288
01:24:29.523 --> 01:24:32.067
Right? 'Cause that's, you know,
a lot of fucking...

1289
01:24:32.109 --> 01:24:35.028
It's a lot of fucking...
fucking product.

1290
01:24:36.196 --> 01:24:38.031
- How did she know about
this place, Errol?

1291
01:24:38.073 --> 01:24:40.200
- I don't know.

1292
01:24:41.034 --> 01:24:42.744
But get this.

1293
01:24:42.786 --> 01:24:45.706
She wants to meet you.

1294
01:24:45.747 --> 01:24:48.667
- To meet me?
- Yes.

1295
01:24:52.212 --> 01:24:55.090
Says she wants to

1296
01:24:56.466 --> 01:24:59.928
trade the product
that she stole for some girl.

1297
01:25:02.055 --> 01:25:04.933
Says you'd know about it.

1298
01:25:26.788 --> 01:25:29.708
- Who's got the magic?
- Oh, you found it.

1299
01:25:33.754 --> 01:25:36.673
- Hail Satan.
- Hail Satan, motherfucker.

1300
01:25:38.133 --> 01:25:41.053
- It's on now.

1301
01:25:42.179 --> 01:25:43.388
- [Cyrus] Is that the crank?

1302
01:26:12.626 --> 01:26:15.504
[punk music]

1303
01:26:33.980 --> 01:26:35.899
Yeah! Yeah!

1304
01:26:58.672 --> 01:27:01.550
[snake hissing]

1305
01:27:02.134 --> 01:27:03.927
Show time.

1306
01:27:21.695 --> 01:27:23.905
[slow music]

1307
01:27:32.122 --> 01:27:33.915
- I've been thinking.

1308
01:27:38.712 --> 01:27:43.175
Might have to accept the fact
that Gabi's already dead.

1309
01:27:47.304 --> 01:27:49.848
- Either way, we gotta find out.

1310
01:27:49.890 --> 01:27:51.349
Can't give up.

1311
01:27:51.391 --> 01:27:54.352
- No, she, my little girl.
You know?

1312
01:28:04.905 --> 01:28:06.948
I used to believe that
my faith protected me,

1313
01:28:06.990 --> 01:28:09.534
that every action of
the soul was meaningful.

1314
01:28:09.576 --> 01:28:10.660
I really did.

1315
01:28:11.995 --> 01:28:15.624
That we're more than just
flesh, bone, molecules.

1316
01:28:17.167 --> 01:28:20.587
That God was good and
everything would work out.

1317
01:28:25.717 --> 01:28:27.677
What am I talking about?

1318
01:28:30.639 --> 01:28:33.391
You don't believe in
any of that, do you?

1319
01:28:34.768 --> 01:28:36.520
- No, Coyote, I don't.

1320
01:28:38.563 --> 01:28:42.651
I think we all know what
life is really about.

1321
01:28:42.692 --> 01:28:46.238
We're not just ready
to accept the bad news.

1322
01:28:47.405 --> 01:28:49.533
So we fight it with God
and the Devil

1323
01:28:49.574 --> 01:28:51.910
and all this New Age bullshit.

1324
01:28:53.286 --> 01:28:56.081
Everyone needs a club, right?

1325
01:28:56.122 --> 01:28:59.501
Club God or Club Scream.
Take your pick.

1326
01:29:02.629 --> 01:29:04.506
But when it comes down to it,

1327
01:29:04.548 --> 01:29:08.927
we all know that it's X amount
of years and then the ground.

1328
01:29:12.389 --> 01:29:15.308
[Case sighs and sniffles]

1329
01:29:22.524 --> 01:29:23.483
Take a look.

1330
01:29:26.278 --> 01:29:29.281
This is the ultimate life form,

1331
01:29:29.322 --> 01:29:30.907
the great equalizer.

1332
01:29:32.158 --> 01:29:35.036
It has no ties,

1333
01:29:35.078 --> 01:29:37.914
plays no favorites.

1334
01:29:38.832 --> 01:29:40.125
All life falls before it.

1335
01:29:42.294 --> 01:29:43.628
It's as simple and profound

1336
01:29:43.670 --> 01:29:46.840
as any parable
the Bible could slop up.

1337
01:29:52.679 --> 01:29:54.222
This is God, Coyote,

1338
01:29:56.141 --> 01:29:58.184
grin and bear it.

1339
01:30:00.103 --> 01:30:03.273
[contemplative music]

1340
01:30:16.119 --> 01:30:18.079
- Gonna get a cigarette.

1346

- Bob!

[gunshot blasting]
[Granny shouting]

1353
01:32:17.741 --> 01:32:18.783
- You're gonna tell us.

1354
01:32:18.825 --> 01:32:19.909
Where's my daughter?

1355
01:32:19.951 --> 01:32:21.995
Where's my daughter?

1356
01:32:22.037 --> 01:32:24.706
[Granny groaning]

1357
01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:27.792
- [Case] Bob?

1358
01:32:31.171 --> 01:32:31.921
Bob.

1359
01:32:32.756 --> 01:32:33.506
Bob.

1360
01:32:37.510 --> 01:32:38.887
Fuck.

1361
01:32:38.928 --> 01:32:41.639
[Granny groaning]

1362
01:32:41.681 --> 01:32:43.808
Granny, you gotta tell us.

1363
01:32:44.934 --> 01:32:46.895
Is the girl still alive?

1364
01:32:48.146 --> 01:32:50.106
- Come and get me, cunt.

1365
01:32:51.149 --> 01:32:53.985
- You're crossing over.

1366
01:32:54.027 --> 01:32:55.070
[Granny screaming]

1367
01:32:55.111 --> 01:32:57.655
[gunshot blasting]

1368
01:33:16.091 --> 01:33:17.634
[horn honking]

1369
01:33:21.054 --> 01:33:22.430
- [Ferryman] What happened?

1370
01:33:24.099 --> 01:33:25.892
[Bob breathing heavily]

1371
01:33:27.185 --> 01:33:30.105
[Ferryman murmuring]

1372
01:33:31.648 --> 01:33:33.274
[Ferryman murmuring]

1373
01:33:39.155 --> 01:33:41.241
Okay, Bob Whatever.

1374
01:33:41.282 --> 01:33:43.118
I'm gonna play a little medic,
okay?

1375
01:33:43.159 --> 01:33:46.412
Going to do a little memory
time on the late night river.

1376
01:33:48.039 --> 01:33:49.499
All that catch-dogging got

1377
01:33:49.541 --> 01:33:52.168
those nerve endings burnt up
pretty bad.

1378
01:33:52.210 --> 01:33:53.795
Heart is all over the place.

1379
01:33:53.837 --> 01:33:55.964
You going to go into shock soon.

1380
01:33:56.005 --> 01:33:59.926
Or you could die from the horse
protein I'm gonna give you.

1381
01:33:59.968 --> 01:34:01.427
Can you hear me?

1382
01:34:01.469 --> 01:34:02.971
- Thirsty.
- What?

1383
01:34:03.012 --> 01:34:04.222
- I'm real thirsty.

1384
01:34:04.264 --> 01:34:04.973
- Okay.

1385
01:34:06.474 --> 01:34:09.269
You should have let me
finish throwing them coins.

1386
01:34:09.310 --> 01:34:12.063
You might be dead already
and we just wasting time.

1387
01:34:12.105 --> 01:34:15.483
[Bob breathing heavily]

1388
01:34:23.616 --> 01:34:26.244
I'm gonna give you
a little fun juice.

1389
01:34:27.245 --> 01:34:29.956
So, whatever trip you make

1390
01:34:29.998 --> 01:34:32.917
I'm gonna make it a little
more enjoyable for you now.

1391
01:34:35.128 --> 01:34:36.087
[Bob sighs]

1392
01:34:49.017 --> 01:34:51.811
- You think he's gonna make it?

1393
01:34:51.853 --> 01:34:52.604
- Maybe.

1394
01:34:53.980 --> 01:34:56.274
But if I was a betting man,

1395
01:34:57.483 --> 01:35:00.153
I'd say we looking
at a dead man.

1396
01:35:06.951 --> 01:35:08.286
- [Bob] How you feeling?

1397
01:35:10.914 --> 01:35:12.332
I love you.

1398
01:35:12.373 --> 01:35:14.167
I love you, Gabi.

1399
01:35:14.209 --> 01:35:17.587
You're gonna be okay,
sweetheart.

1400
01:35:17.629 --> 01:35:19.255
You're gonna be okay.

1401
01:35:20.298 --> 01:35:21.507
Is it better?

1402
01:35:21.549 --> 01:35:23.092
Do you feel it?

1403
01:35:23.134 --> 01:35:25.345
Yeah, that's good.

1404
01:35:27.889 --> 01:35:28.640
Now,

1405
01:35:31.976 --> 01:35:33.186
it's gonna be okay.

1406
01:35:33.228 --> 01:35:34.938
- [Case] It's okay.

1407
01:35:34.979 --> 01:35:36.022
It's okay.

1408
01:35:36.064 --> 01:35:38.483
Breathe. You gotta breathe.

1409
01:35:38.524 --> 01:35:39.275
Please.

1410
01:35:41.402 --> 01:35:43.238
- You take her.

1411
01:35:43.279 --> 01:35:44.364
Promise me, right?
- Okay.

1412
01:35:44.405 --> 01:35:47.116
- If she's alive, you, you...

1413
01:35:47.158 --> 01:35:48.952
- Sure. Sure, I can.

1414
01:35:48.993 --> 01:35:53.164
- You're the only one I
trust. So you take her.

1415
01:35:53.206 --> 01:35:55.250
You promise me. Promise me!

1416
01:35:57.877 --> 01:35:58.628
- Yes, I promise.

1417
01:35:58.670 --> 01:35:59.420
- Mm?

1418
01:36:00.964 --> 01:36:04.050
[Bob breathing heavily]

1419
01:36:43.256 --> 01:36:44.924
- Alive, huh?

1420
01:36:46.718 --> 01:36:48.469
- Yeah, looks like it.

1421
01:36:56.060 --> 01:36:57.395
- Are you thirsty?

1422
01:36:58.980 --> 01:36:59.731
- Yeah.

1423
01:37:12.076 --> 01:37:14.495

[water trickling]

1425
01:38:04.003 --> 01:38:06.672
- I'm glad you made it, Coyote.

Girl, what are you doing?

1617
01:49:19.470 --> 01:49:21.263
You were all the way
out and then come back

1618
01:49:21.305 --> 01:49:25.017
with this big old neon
sign around your neck.

1619
01:49:25.059 --> 01:49:28.062
Shooting the place up,
guns blazing. Why?

1620
01:49:29.646 --> 01:49:30.939
May as well have
slit your own throat.

- I know.

1622
01:49:32.608 --> 01:49:35.069

about your little rehab?

You don't think I know?
I fucking know.

1625

I need you to tell him
something for me, Wood.

Tell him he can have me.

I'll bring the money,
I'll bring everything.

He can do whatever the
fuck he wants with me,

1629
01:49:55.172 --> 01:49:58.008
have a field day
with my dead body.

1630

me to say, Casey?

We both know
how this is gonna end.

1635
01:50:14.817 --> 01:50:17.069
- I gotta have this one, Wood.

1636
01:50:17.111 --> 01:50:19.780
He doesn't want the girl.
He wants me.

1637
01:50:19.822 --> 01:50:21.907
You tell him that.

1638

Fuck you!
I'm so fucking over it!

You want the money?
Is that what you want?

You got the fucking
money. Actually, take it.

We get Headcase, and you
get the girl, correct?

That's the arrangement?

This is what she proposed,
correct?

1690
01:55:03.146 --> 01:55:05.190
But, now it's no good?

1691
01:55:05.232 --> 01:55:07.651
- No good.

I'm not trading her. I'm not
trading her for anything.

we're safe and sound.

- Pay me later?
I don't think so, Bob.

01:55:39.850 --> 01:55:41.935
It's not like I'm giving
you half your daughter back.

Your legacy's waiting
for you over that hill.

When you see her, just drop
the money and take her.

When you get home,

1710

Ask Arthur and John Lee
who killed the old witch.

1711
01:56:16.219 --> 01:56:17.888
Ask who hired me to go

1712

carve up
your pretty little wife.

- Now you, headcase.
I want a word with you.

I just want you to know that
whatever happens tonight,

And when we find you,

1721
01:57:11.191 --> 01:57:14.528

right there to watch you beg.

- [Bob] What?

1724

the fucking deal.

1725
01:57:36.675 --> 01:57:38.260
- You go behind my back.
It's great.

1726

- I had it all worked
out, you fucking idiot!

It was done,
you had your daughter backi!

- They're gonna come for
us, you know that, right?

1730
01:57:46.518 --> 01:57:48.186
They're not letting us go.

1731
01:57:48.228 --> 01:57:49.396
They're gonna ride us out
into the fucking black hole,

1732
01:57:49.437 --> 01:57:50.897
- then they'll come.
- I know!

1733
01:57:50.939 --> 01:57:52.023
If you know, then what's
your fucking plan?!

1734
01:57:52.065 --> 01:57:53.567
I don't have a plan, alright?!

1735
01:57:53.608 --> 01:57:56.444
Let's just go get Gabi
and we'll figure it out.

1736

- Some people are coming.
Some very bad people.

1763
02:01:29.032 --> 02:01:30.575
If they see you,

1764
02:01:30.617 --> 02:01:33.244
you point this at them
and you pull the trigger.

1765
02:01:33.286 --> 02:01:35.872
If you run out of bullets,
you just drop your gun,

1766
