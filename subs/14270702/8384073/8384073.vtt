00:13:18.841 --> 00:13:20.146
You want coffee?

185
00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:22.888
Yes, thanks. Black.

186
00:13:22.888 --> 00:13:24.890
[thunder rumbling]

187
00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:26.631
[clears throat]
- I would offer you a beer,

188
00:13:26.631 --> 00:13:29.416
but I'll be on the wagon
for the next 40 or 50 years.

189
00:13:39.774 --> 00:13:42.168
I believe this was
a cult murder.

190
00:13:43.169 --> 00:13:46.172
Not a robbery or any of the
crap you read in the paper.

191
00:13:47.347 --> 00:13:49.306
I have photos from that night.

192
00:13:49.306 --> 00:13:52.004
You could take a look at them
and tell me what you think.

193
00:13:54.398 --> 00:13:55.703
Okay.

194
00:14:14.548 --> 00:14:16.420
Was Gabi into drugs?

195
00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:17.900
No.

196
00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:20.076
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

197
00:14:20.076 --> 00:14:21.555
I know my daughter.

198
00:14:22.774 --> 00:14:26.038
Her friends into satanic
shit of any kind?

199
00:14:26.038 --> 00:14:27.170
Satanic?

200
00:14:28.127 --> 00:14:29.563
She's 14 years old.

201
00:14:29.563 --> 00:14:32.218
Does she look like she hangs
with that kind of crowd?

202
00:14:32.218 --> 00:14:34.829
We live in a small
Christian community.

203
00:14:34.829 --> 00:14:37.310
We don't have much in
the way of deviant behavior.

204
00:14:41.793 --> 00:14:45.101
We all came from
family-oriented communities.

205
00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.494
Even me.

206
00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:07.210
Was this man a drug addict?

207
00:15:09.081 --> 00:15:11.301
This is a syringe mark.

208
00:15:11.823 --> 00:15:12.998
Is it?

209
00:15:13.651 --> 00:15:15.435
What about this?

210
00:15:17.307 --> 00:15:19.613
Judgment.
What do you know about it?

211
00:15:19.613 --> 00:15:21.398
Was he injected
with a paralytic?

212
00:15:21.398 --> 00:15:23.791
What do you know
about it? Case?

213
00:15:23.791 --> 00:15:25.576
No, no.
- I need to think.

214
00:15:25.576 --> 00:15:27.578
You gotta tell me
what you know.

215
00:15:27.578 --> 00:15:28.492
No, I can't.

216
00:15:29.058 --> 00:15:30.320
Case.

217
00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.756
- No.
- Case. Case, wait.

218
00:15:31.756 --> 00:15:33.410
No, please.
I just need you to go away.

219
00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:34.889
You have to tell me
what you know.

220
00:15:34.889 --> 00:15:36.500
- What's going on?
- You have to go away!

221
00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.197
I lost my wife.
I lost my daughter.

222
00:15:38.197 --> 00:15:39.894
[screaming indistinctly]
You have to tell me
what you know!

223
00:15:39.894 --> 00:15:41.418
That's enough,
Mr. Hightower.

224
00:15:43.942 --> 00:15:45.552
I'm leaving.

225
00:15:46.379 --> 00:15:47.859
What'd you say?

226
00:15:49.295 --> 00:15:50.949
I didn't hear you.

227
00:15:52.646 --> 00:15:53.996
You're what?

228
00:15:56.781 --> 00:15:58.348
I said, I'm leaving.

229
00:15:58.348 --> 00:16:00.567
Oh, yeah. That's what I...

230
00:16:00.567 --> 00:16:02.221
that's what I thought you said.

231
00:16:02.221 --> 00:16:03.614
Ah!
[man exclaiming]

232
00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:08.401
No! Cyrus, Cyrus,
she doesn't--

233
00:16:08.401 --> 00:16:10.142
[talking indistinctly]
- Stay out of it.

234
00:16:10.142 --> 00:16:11.317
[head thudding]

235
00:16:11.317 --> 00:16:12.492
[man laughing]

236
00:16:12.492 --> 00:16:14.755
Anyone else wanna leave?

237
00:16:15.234 --> 00:16:16.366
Huh?

238
00:16:16.888 --> 00:16:18.759
[moaning]

239
00:16:19.586 --> 00:16:22.111
What about you, bitch?
You want to try me again?

240
00:16:22.111 --> 00:16:23.808
I got another boot here.

241
00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:30.510
[foot thudding]
[groaning]

242
00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:32.034
[breathing heavily]

243
00:16:32.034 --> 00:16:33.948
[gunfire]

244
00:16:39.563 --> 00:16:40.738
Fuck you.

245
00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:54.839
[groans]

246
00:17:16.165 --> 00:17:17.601
Keep it running.

247
00:17:33.834 --> 00:17:35.706
[knocking on door]

248
00:17:39.884 --> 00:17:41.103
Hey, it's me.

249
00:17:43.148 --> 00:17:45.237
You're not gonna
shoot me, are you?

250
00:17:46.804 --> 00:17:48.806
I wasn't expecting anyone.

251
00:17:49.328 --> 00:17:50.764
What do you want?

252
00:17:52.375 --> 00:17:54.942
I think I know
who took your daughter

253
00:17:54.942 --> 00:17:56.901
and I'm betting she's alive.

254
00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:59.643
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

255
00:18:00.905 --> 00:18:02.428
The paralytic, the card.

256
00:18:03.255 --> 00:18:05.257
I know this crew's handiwork.

257
00:18:05.257 --> 00:18:08.347
- How?
- Personal experience.

258
00:18:11.045 --> 00:18:12.699
I used to be one.

259
00:18:14.527 --> 00:18:16.573
And you think Gabi's alive?

260
00:18:17.182 --> 00:18:18.792
I do.

261
00:18:18.792 --> 00:18:20.142
All right.

262
00:18:21.839 --> 00:18:23.493
Well, I'm gonna need
a sworn statement,

263
00:18:23.493 --> 00:18:25.321
and that means names,

264
00:18:25.321 --> 00:18:26.713
descriptions
of everyone involved.

265
00:18:26.713 --> 00:18:28.324
Slow down, Bob.

266
00:18:29.194 --> 00:18:31.065
If you think that you're going
to track them down

267
00:18:31.065 --> 00:18:33.416
with the cops or even the FBI,
you can forget about it.

268
00:18:33.416 --> 00:18:35.200
- Forget about it?
- Yeah.

269
00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:38.334
These are the followers
of the Left Handed Path.

270
00:18:38.334 --> 00:18:40.379
The word of the Devil.

271
00:18:40.379 --> 00:18:42.076
What? You think you can
just write down an address

272
00:18:42.076 --> 00:18:43.948
and go round 'em up?

273
00:18:43.948 --> 00:18:46.168
You won't even get close.

274
00:18:46.168 --> 00:18:48.474
And as soon as they see
a bunch of dumb shit cops

275
00:18:48.474 --> 00:18:50.607
sniffing around,
the first thing Cyrus will do

276
00:18:50.607 --> 00:18:52.348
is slit your daughter's throat
and drink her blood.

277
00:18:52.348 --> 00:18:54.524
- Don't fucking say that.
- I know that it's hard.

278
00:18:54.524 --> 00:18:56.178
I know that.

279
00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:58.789
But you gotta hear me
on this, okay?

280
00:19:00.617 --> 00:19:02.532
Forget about the authorities
tracking your daughter down.

281
00:19:02.532 --> 00:19:04.577
It ain't gonna happen.

282
00:19:04.577 --> 00:19:07.537
If you want her back,
you gotta get her yourself.

283
00:19:08.277 --> 00:19:10.192
And lose the Boy Scout uniform.

284
00:19:10.192 --> 00:19:12.194
All right, yeah.
What else?

285
00:19:12.194 --> 00:19:14.196
Get as much cash as you can
and a truck that runs.

286
00:19:14.196 --> 00:19:15.371
- I got one.
- Okay, good,

287
00:19:15.371 --> 00:19:17.024
'cause you and me
are going on the road.

288
00:19:19.026 --> 00:19:21.942
- We are?
- Yeah, you and me, Bob.

289
00:19:21.942 --> 00:19:23.640
I'll be back,
bright and early.

290
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.033
I don't understand.
Where do you fit in?

291
00:19:27.818 --> 00:19:30.212
You think that
you can do this alone?

292
00:19:30.995 --> 00:19:34.433
No offense, but you don't
send out sheep to hunt wolves.

293
00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:41.397
[birdsong]

294
00:19:41.397 --> 00:19:43.790
[footsteps approaching]

295
00:19:44.965 --> 00:19:46.924
We should reconsider.

296
00:19:48.665 --> 00:19:50.406
This is reckless, son.
And dangerous.

297
00:19:50.406 --> 00:19:52.277
Just leave it alone, Arthur.
I've made my decision.

298
00:19:52.277 --> 00:19:53.670
I'll live with the consequences.

299
00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:55.672
She's such a tramped out
excuse of a thing.

300
00:19:55.672 --> 00:19:57.195
I wouldn't put my faith in that.

301
00:19:57.195 --> 00:19:59.806
Oh, I put my faith in God.
Her, I'm traveling with.

302
00:19:59.806 --> 00:20:01.765
How do you know
she won't sell you out?

303
00:20:01.765 --> 00:20:03.114
- I don't.
- How do you know

304
00:20:03.114 --> 00:20:05.116
she won't rob ya?
- I'm dying inside, Arthur.

305
00:20:05.116 --> 00:20:06.770
Do you understand?

306
00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:09.468
A little bit every day,
but I'm dying.

307
00:20:09.468 --> 00:20:11.905
I might be stupid,
but I'm going.

308
00:20:15.866 --> 00:20:17.433
Give me the keys, I'll drive.

309
00:20:31.708 --> 00:20:33.275
[engine starting]

310
00:20:35.407 --> 00:20:37.670
I want you
to know something, miss...

311
00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:40.412
If anything happens
to this man over there,

312
00:20:40.412 --> 00:20:44.329
there is nothing you can say
or do to save your ass from me.

313
00:20:45.025 --> 00:20:47.767
We understand each other?
- Absolutely.

314
00:20:47.767 --> 00:20:50.901
And you know what?
I'm blown away.

315
00:20:51.467 --> 00:20:55.558
As a matter of fact, I'm
a little wet between my legs.

316
00:21:02.478 --> 00:21:03.957
Be careful!

317
00:21:13.489 --> 00:21:14.794
What?

318
00:21:14.794 --> 00:21:16.535
Nothing.

319
00:21:16.535 --> 00:21:18.232
Just thinking,
maybe if you'd had

320
00:21:18.232 --> 00:21:20.278
a stronger moral compass
as a child,

321
00:21:20.278 --> 00:21:22.585
like a religious foundation,

322
00:21:22.585 --> 00:21:24.238
that you'd possibly be

323
00:21:24.238 --> 00:21:25.849
better equipped to deal
with what happened to you.

324
00:21:25.849 --> 00:21:28.242
- You fucking kidding me?
- Well, think about it.

325
00:21:28.242 --> 00:21:32.116
I got snatched, asshole,
just like your little girl.

326
00:21:32.116 --> 00:21:35.293
Right out from underneath
my mother's nose when I was 11.

327
00:21:35.293 --> 00:21:37.382
Ain't got nothing
to do with religion.

328
00:21:37.382 --> 00:21:40.037
I'm sorry. Like I said,
I don't mean to judge.

329
00:21:40.037 --> 00:21:41.517
Yeah, well, too late.

330
00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:47.827
[soft music]

331
00:22:11.677 --> 00:22:13.723
[barking]

332
00:22:13.723 --> 00:22:17.335
[gasping]
Hi, come here!

333
00:22:17.335 --> 00:22:19.293
Hi, hi.

334
00:22:19.293 --> 00:22:20.860
Oh, my gosh.

335
00:22:21.992 --> 00:22:23.689
Yeah, they remember you.

336
00:22:25.343 --> 00:22:26.475
Ferryman.

337
00:22:26.475 --> 00:22:28.259
You gonna give them
all the love?

338
00:22:28.259 --> 00:22:30.043
Come on, now.
[laughing]

339
00:22:30.043 --> 00:22:32.568
Come on, now.
Come on, now.

340
00:22:32.568 --> 00:22:34.396
[moaning, kissing]

341
00:22:35.962 --> 00:22:37.442
Look at you.

342
00:22:37.442 --> 00:22:39.183
Glad to see
you're amongst the living.

343
00:22:39.183 --> 00:22:41.272
That's me,
little miss sunshine.

344
00:22:41.272 --> 00:22:43.143
So, who's that over there?

345
00:22:43.143 --> 00:22:44.536
Oh, that's Bob.

346
00:22:44.536 --> 00:22:47.321
His last name's whatever
you put on his new ID.

347
00:22:47.321 --> 00:22:48.584
Okay, Mr. Bob Whatever.

348
00:22:48.584 --> 00:22:50.281
You got that fucking armor
for me, or what?

349
00:22:50.281 --> 00:22:52.326
I got the whole store
over there for you.

350
00:22:52.326 --> 00:22:54.067
- Hey.
- Hey, how you doing, Robert?

351
00:22:55.373 --> 00:22:56.418
Yeah.

352
00:22:58.507 --> 00:23:00.378
Should we start this ID?

353
00:23:00.378 --> 00:23:01.814
No.

354
00:23:01.814 --> 00:23:03.076
Decal work first.

355
00:23:03.076 --> 00:23:04.861
I want shit with bite.

356
00:23:04.861 --> 00:23:06.515
Well, with that
pasty white skin,

357
00:23:06.515 --> 00:23:08.168
this ink gonna look real nice.

358
00:23:08.734 --> 00:23:09.996
I thought
we were here for guns.

359
00:23:09.996 --> 00:23:11.563
You didn't say anything
about tattoos.

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:44.978
So stupid.

534
00:33:44.978 --> 00:33:47.242
Didn't even look like her.

535
00:33:47.807 --> 00:33:49.461
I didn't even know
what I would have done

536
00:33:49.461 --> 00:33:52.595
if it was actually her
or what I would've said.

537
00:33:54.162 --> 00:33:57.121
Hey, Mom.
How's it going?

538
00:33:57.121 --> 00:33:59.993
How have the last dozen
fucking years been?

539
00:34:00.907 --> 00:34:03.432
Maybe I would have asked what
I was like when I was younger

540
00:34:03.432 --> 00:34:07.523
because I don't
fucking remember. Or...

541
00:34:07.523 --> 00:34:09.568
You know,
when she stopped looking,

542
00:34:09.568 --> 00:34:11.396
like, what the fuck happened?

543
00:34:14.051 --> 00:34:15.835
You ever find out
what happened to her?

544
00:34:15.835 --> 00:34:17.446
Does she even know you're alive?

545
00:34:17.446 --> 00:34:19.143
No. I... I don't know.

546
00:34:19.143 --> 00:34:21.014
I don't even know
if I'd want her to.

547
00:34:21.014 --> 00:34:23.843
- Well, why not?
- Because I don't.

548
00:34:23.843 --> 00:34:26.107
All right?
It's been a dozen fucking years.

549
00:34:26.107 --> 00:34:27.282
And what's with
all the questions?

550
00:34:27.282 --> 00:34:28.674
Okay, okay.

551
00:34:28.674 --> 00:34:29.980
Mind your own
fucking business.

552
00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:32.025
- All right.
- Can we get the check, please?

553
00:34:33.114 --> 00:34:35.942
[metal music playing]

554
00:34:35.942 --> 00:34:37.770
[cheering]

555
00:34:51.044 --> 00:34:53.525
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

556
00:34:53.525 --> 00:34:55.875
The prodigal daughter returns.

557
00:34:56.528 --> 00:34:58.574
And who's this?
A new member of the family?

558
00:34:58.574 --> 00:35:01.098
This is Bob.
Bob, this is Errol.

559
00:35:01.098 --> 00:35:04.841
What are you doing
here, Headcase?

560
00:35:04.841 --> 00:35:08.061
Well, we were having dinner
in Nogales

561
00:35:08.061 --> 00:35:09.802
and I remembered your bar.

562
00:35:09.802 --> 00:35:13.023
So I thought, why not
come by and say hello?

563
00:35:16.418 --> 00:35:18.898
Oh, dear, dear, dear.

564
00:35:19.508 --> 00:35:21.814
I'm glad to see you
couldn't make it.

565
00:35:24.774 --> 00:35:26.079
I'm leaving.

566
00:35:26.732 --> 00:35:28.212
Right?

567
00:35:29.082 --> 00:35:30.519
[glass breaking]

568
00:35:31.259 --> 00:35:34.262
Hey! Hey!

569
00:35:34.262 --> 00:35:36.960
Bob! Bob, stop!

570
00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.831
Fucking piece of work,
you know that?

571
00:35:38.831 --> 00:35:40.746
- Bet your ass.
- Clean and sober, huh?

572
00:35:40.746 --> 00:35:42.139
When'd you start using?

573
00:35:42.139 --> 00:35:44.533
When did I start keeping
my sleeves down, huh?

574
00:35:44.533 --> 00:35:46.404
- I don't give a shit.
- You don't fucking know.

575
00:35:46.404 --> 00:35:48.232
Do you?
- Leave me alone. Just shut up!

576
00:35:48.232 --> 00:35:50.234
100 fucking degrees in that
shit locker restaurant,

577
00:35:50.234 --> 00:35:52.149
I've got my sleeves tucked
in my fucking hands.

578
00:35:52.149 --> 00:35:53.933
Fucking stooge.

579
00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:57.720
You want to fucking know
what's going on, huh?

580
00:35:59.678 --> 00:36:01.506
- Oh.
- Fucking, listen and learn,

581
00:36:01.506 --> 00:36:03.552
desk boy.
- Don't fucking...

582
00:36:06.337 --> 00:36:08.818
Powder? Vitamin C.

583
00:36:09.732 --> 00:36:11.168
Liquid cleaner.

584
00:36:18.131 --> 00:36:20.873
Looks bad, scabs up nice.

585
00:36:20.873 --> 00:36:22.701
No one but a fucking moron
would believe

586
00:36:22.701 --> 00:36:25.051
that I'm a shooter without
checking me out first,

587
00:36:25.051 --> 00:36:28.446
especially with an albatross
like you hanging around my neck.

588
00:36:29.882 --> 00:36:31.188
Happy?

589
00:36:33.364 --> 00:36:35.192
You don't trust me?
We're supposed to be
a fucking team.

590
00:36:35.192 --> 00:36:37.412
Not a team. I'm the one
who's finding your daughter.

591
00:36:37.412 --> 00:36:38.891
You don't need to know shit.

592
00:36:38.891 --> 00:36:40.545
Better off staying stupid.

593
00:36:40.545 --> 00:36:41.981
Perfect.

594
00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:47.073
[sighing]

595
00:36:58.084 --> 00:36:59.564
Listen...
- Forget it, Bob.

596
00:36:59.564 --> 00:37:02.306
You're strictly
the missionary position.

597
00:37:02.306 --> 00:37:04.700
You lie to me to get me
to react a certain way,

598
00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:06.223
then hold the--
- The missionary position

599
00:37:06.223 --> 00:37:07.355
and not a trick more.

600
00:37:07.355 --> 00:37:09.400
Is that a slogan
or just pure venom?

601
00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.359
'Cause the last time I looked--
- Last time you looked

602
00:37:11.359 --> 00:37:13.317
would just be that, the last
time you fucking looked!

603
00:37:13.317 --> 00:37:15.014
I'm looking at you!

604
00:37:15.014 --> 00:37:18.627
The banality of your cheap
whore tricks, the lies.

605
00:37:18.627 --> 00:37:19.932
- Fuck you!
- No, no, you don't

606
00:37:19.932 --> 00:37:21.412
fucking fool me.
You think you fool me?

607
00:37:21.412 --> 00:37:23.675
I know why you're here.
I'm gonna help him get her back,

608
00:37:23.675 --> 00:37:27.244
otherwise, if we get too close,
Cyrus'll kill her quick.

609
00:37:27.244 --> 00:37:29.594
What? You think your therapist
wouldn't tell me?

610
00:37:30.247 --> 00:37:31.770
I did say that.

611
00:37:33.381 --> 00:37:34.730
I just thought...

612
00:37:36.035 --> 00:37:38.342
If she had to go through
what I did.

613
00:37:38.342 --> 00:37:39.561
Just save it.

614
00:37:40.126 --> 00:37:41.824
I can imagine it all.

615
00:37:50.006 --> 00:37:53.139
Errol said Cyrus is coming.

616
00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:56.578
When?

617
00:37:58.275 --> 00:38:00.233
A few days, a week.

618
00:38:01.452 --> 00:38:03.324
He doesn't know,
but he's coming.

619
00:38:04.977 --> 00:38:08.241
And Errol's gonna arrange
a little homecoming for me.

620
00:38:27.565 --> 00:38:29.132
I'm going.

621
00:38:29.132 --> 00:38:31.177
Can't stand
this room any longer.

622
00:38:33.571 --> 00:38:36.182
[soft music playing]

623
00:38:41.579 --> 00:38:43.146
Where's Errol?

624
00:38:43.146 --> 00:38:44.321
[in Spanish]

625
00:38:44.321 --> 00:38:46.671
[in English]: Maybe still
at Maquila.

626
00:38:46.671 --> 00:38:49.021
Oh. Tequila, please.

627
00:38:52.895 --> 00:38:54.026
[sighing]

628
00:39:03.384 --> 00:39:05.473
Nice fucking artwork, man.

629
00:39:07.431 --> 00:39:09.302
I mean it.

630
00:39:09.302 --> 00:39:11.696
Fucking deluxe shit
you got there.

631
00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:14.395
Thanks.

632
00:39:20.836 --> 00:39:22.577
What the fuck, man?

633
00:39:22.577 --> 00:39:24.666
Gutter's waiting.
Time to move.

634
00:39:24.666 --> 00:39:26.798

Hey!

640
00:40:24.465 --> 00:40:26.641
He's close, isn't he?

641
00:40:26.641 --> 00:40:28.817
Fucking black magic.

642
00:40:31.689 --> 00:40:32.995
Oh, fuck.

643
00:40:32.995 --> 00:40:35.127
If they cross, we're fucked.

644
00:40:35.127 --> 00:40:36.825
We're fucked,
but we're crossing.

[indistinct chatter]

646
00:40:42.265 --> 00:40:43.745
What about the guns?

647
00:40:43.745 --> 00:40:45.486
Don't worry about it. Go.

Well, well.

662
00:43:46.101 --> 00:43:47.493
Hello.

663
00:43:50.366 --> 00:43:52.498
I want to come home.
[gasping]

664
00:43:52.498 --> 00:43:53.499
Ah!

[coughing]

666
00:43:58.243 --> 00:44:00.158
What?
[gasping]

667
00:44:00.158 --> 00:44:01.986
You said you wanted
a little blood.

Okay.

00:45:03.352 --> 00:45:04.483
It's okay.

[sighing]

679
00:45:24.286 --> 00:45:26.767
We all wanna come home
in the end, don't we?

680
00:45:31.815 --> 00:45:33.991
But how much is it worth to you?

681
00:45:36.602 --> 00:45:38.648
It's worth everything.

682
00:45:40.911 --> 00:45:42.478
Good answer.

683
00:45:47.222 --> 00:45:49.180
Okay, load her up.

[sighing]

687
00:46:23.867 --> 00:46:27.001
You know what the real
equalizers in life are?

688
00:46:29.133 --> 00:46:30.918
Suffering and death.

689
00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:33.790
Everything else is daycare.

690
00:46:33.790 --> 00:46:36.314
But suffering and death?

691
00:46:36.314 --> 00:46:37.881
They lay it out pretty fast

692
00:46:37.881 --> 00:46:40.014
when it comes
to who you really are.

693
00:46:44.018 --> 00:46:46.977
How do I know I can trust
you coming home?

694
00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:51.677
How do I know you're not
trying to fuck me?

695
00:46:56.900 --> 00:46:59.033
Maybe you don't love me anymore.

696
00:47:00.077 --> 00:47:02.166
You bring a pistol?

697
00:47:02.166 --> 00:47:05.039
Maybe you wanna punch
a few holes in the messenger.

698
00:47:06.170 --> 00:47:07.737
No.

699
00:47:09.478 --> 00:47:11.001
I don't know.

700
00:47:11.001 --> 00:47:13.525
People play all sorts of games.

701
00:47:13.525 --> 00:47:14.918
[chuckling]

702
00:47:14.918 --> 00:47:17.486
Know what I mean, Errol?
- What?

703
00:47:17.486 --> 00:47:19.096
You like games.

704
00:47:19.096 --> 00:47:21.098
Don't ya, chief?

705
00:47:21.098 --> 00:47:24.275
Uh...
[laughing]

706
00:47:24.275 --> 00:47:25.929
Yeah, I don't know.

707
00:47:25.929 --> 00:47:28.410
I don't even know what
the fuck you're talking about.

708
00:47:28.410 --> 00:47:30.978
Sure you do, Mr. Firewater,

709
00:47:30.978 --> 00:47:34.372
Mr. Fucking Yuppie Redskin Phony
who changed his name

710
00:47:34.372 --> 00:47:37.288
so nobody would know
he was a piece of shit
from the reservation.

711
00:47:38.724 --> 00:47:42.946
I mean, I'm half Cherokee,
but the fuck?

712
00:47:42.946 --> 00:47:46.297
How do I know you and the dead
