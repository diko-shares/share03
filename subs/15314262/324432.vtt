{12898}{12922}This was no bear.
{12922}{12970}Bears don'tattack|people underwater.
{12970}{13042}Probably a beaver,then.
{13042}{13138}Ah, a whole sentence|sarcastic.

{14002}{14074}There was an accident|in Maine.
{14074}{14122}Some guy got killed|by something in a lake.
{14122}{14218}Probably a bear,|butthey found a tooth.
{14218}{14242}Atooth?
{14242}{14266}Afragmentof a tooth,
{14266}{14338}one they say couldn't|have come from any bear.
{14338}{14434}Evidently it looks prehistoric,|like maybe a dinosaur.
{14434}{14482}Oh,well,then I'm sure|thatthat's what itwas.
{14482}{14530}He was killed|by a dinosaur.
{14530}{14578}Is there anything else?
{14578}{14602}I, uh,wantyou|to go there.
{14602}{14650}What?
{14650}{14722}It's probably nothing,|butyou're a paleontologist.
{14722}{14770}This is whatwe do.
{14770}{14794}What do you mean,|this is whatwe do?
{14794}{14842}I'd like you to|check outthis tooth.
{14842}{14890}I'm nota field person.

{15226}{15250}waittill I cool off...
{15250}{15298}It has nothing|to do with that.
{15298}{15346}I don't do field work,|and even if I did, Maine?
{15346}{15394}I'm allergic to timber.
{15394}{15442}- Kelly.|- I am not going to Maine.
{15442}{15490}I'm not going|to Maine.
{15490}{15586}It's ridiculous.
{15658}{15706}It's gonna be rough

{15754}{15802}Yeah,that's fine.|Thank you.
{15802}{15898}We're doing|the bestwe can.
{15898}{15970}Could you not|talk to me?

{16210}{16258}Keough:|Justcame up screaming.
{16258}{16282}Kelly:What did he say?
{16282}{16354}Just kind of gurgled.|He was pretty much dead.
{16354}{16402}You didn'tsee anything?
{16402}{16450}The lake was calm|until up he came.
{16450}{16474}The tooth is in here.
{16474}{16522}Oh,that's--|that's the morgue.
{16522}{16570}Yes.
{16570}{16642}Well, is the dead guy|in there?
{16642}{16738}That's where they|keep them.
{16738}{16762}Look...
{16762}{16810}you wantme to bring|the tooth out here?
{16810}{16834}No.
{16834}{16882}No. Let's...
{16882}{16906}Afteryou.
{16906}{16930}[door closes]
{16930}{17026}This is reptilian.|And this is nota fossil.
{17026}{17074}You really pulled this|outofthis guy?
{17074}{17122}Yes, I did.
{17122}{17194}I'll need to get|a microscopic look at it.
{17194}{17218}There you go.
{17218}{17314}Great.
{17314}{17338}Maybe I should see--
{17338}{17410}I wouldn't.
{17410}{17506}I can deal with|dead men--bodies.
{17602}{17626}Ohh.
{17626}{17722}Uhh. Ohh,jeez.
{17842}{17890}How long did this attack|go on for?
{17890}{17962}Seconds.|8 maybe 10.
{17962}{18034}Oh, and, uh,this is how|he came up to the boat?
{18034}{18058}Yes.
{18058}{18130}Uh-huh.
{18130}{18226}I'd like|to see this lake.
{18226}{18298}Keough: Nobody lives|within 25 miles of it,
{18298}{18370}exceptsome old couple|who live righton the lake.
{18370}{18418}Teenagers trek in|every once in a while
{18418}{18466}to skinny-dip.
{18466}{18514}None have disappeared.
{18514}{18562}None have spotted|anything unusual.
{18562}{18610}Did you talk|to the old couple?
{18610}{18634}Notyet.
{18634}{18682}What kind of backup|do we have?
{18682}{18706}We?
{18706}{18754}What?
{18754}{18826}I'm a little unclear|as to why the museum
{18826}{18850}would send|somebody here.
{18850}{18874}You gota thing|againstmuseums?
{18874}{18922}No, I got nothing|againstmuseums.
{18922}{19018}Ever been in one?
{19114}{19138}What is that?
{19138}{19186}Lightweightforward-area|air-device unit.
{19186}{19234}Whatever's outthere,
{19234}{19282}one shotwith this,|it's dead.
{19282}{19330}Why exactly|would you have that?
{19330}{19378}[buzzing]
{19378}{19474}God.
{19522}{19594}Mosquitoes. I gota thing|aboutmosquitoes.
{19594}{19618}If you're all set,|let's go.
{19618}{19666}We're saved.
{19666}{19690}Amuseum in New York
{19690}{19762}justsent us some|additional backup.
{19762}{19810}Kelly Scott.
{19810}{19858}Jack Wells.
{19858}{19882}Hi.
{19882}{19930}Uh, some museum|sentyou, huh?
{19930}{19978}What, are we all|museum bigots in Maine?
{19978}{20002}She's rude sarcastic.
{20002}{20050}You two should|getalong.
{20050}{20098}I'm afraid I can't letyou|go with us, ma'am.
{20098}{20146}Sheriff Keough|said I could.
{20146}{20194}Unfortunately, Fish and Game|supersedes the sheriff.
{20194}{20242}Why do you have to supersede?|Maybe I might be of--
{20242}{20266}Ma'am, look,
{20266}{20314}this isn'tsome kind of|fact-finding expedition.
{20314}{20362}Yes, I knowthat.
{20362}{20386}It's nota science trip.
{20386}{20410}Could you be|a little more condescending?
{20410}{20506}'Cause I'm not real great|with subtlety.
{20506}{20554}Something in that lake|killed somebody, right?
{20554}{20602}I appreciate|you're trying to help.
{20602}{20674}I'm really glad thatyou|broughtthe raid.
{20674}{20698}Now,that's better.
{20698}{20722}Ma'am,|it's not gonna work--
{20722}{20770}If you call me ''ma'am''|one more time, I'll sue you,
{20770}{20794}and with today's laws,|it's possible.
{20794}{20866}She's good.
{20866}{20914}Look, I won't interfere.
{20914}{20962}And if I do,you've got|a sheriff handy to arrestme,
{20962}{21034}but I understand if I threaten|your Fish and Game authority--
{21034}{21058}Excuse me.
{21058}{21082}Is ittrue|you're going to look
{21082}{21130}for some kind of monster|in Black Lake?
{21130}{21202}Well,we're just gonna|investigate an accident.
{21202}{21226}There's no monster.
{21226}{21274}We heard a man|was bit in half.
{21274}{21322}Well,|there was an accident.
{21322}{21418}That's all. It's|nothing to worry about.
{21490}{21562}Oh, please.
{21562}{21658}All right. Let's go.
{22138}{22186}Well, my husband|passed away.
{22186}{22258}It's been|almost 2 years now.
{22258}{22306}My department doesn't|have any record ofthat,
{22306}{22354}Mrs. Bickerman.
{22354}{22378}Well, I'm sorry.
{22378}{22450}Incomplete records|hauntme so.
{22450}{22498}Whatwas the cause|of your husband's death,
{22498}{22570}ma'am, do you know?
{22570}{22618}We don'tmean|to invade your privacy,
{22618}{22666}butwas he ill?|Was he sick?
{22666}{22690}Was he swallowed?
{22690}{22714}[whispers]|Sheriff.
{22714}{22762}Uh, Mrs. Bickerman,|the reason we're here.
{22762}{22810}Aman was fatally|attacked yesterday
{22810}{22882}by some animal|in this lake.
{22882}{22930}Do you know|howyour husband died?
{22930}{22954}Oh,yes.
{22954}{23050}I killed him.
{23050}{23074}You killed him?
{23074}{23098}Oh,yes.
{23098}{23122}Wells: Uh...
{23122}{23218}and howwould you have|accomplished this, ma'am?
{23218}{23242}Well...
{23242}{23290}He was very sick,
{23290}{23362}and--and he refused|to go to a doctor.
{23362}{23434}He'd be coherentone day|and incoherentthe next.
{23434}{23506}And,well,|one coherent day
{23506}{23530}he asked me to end|his suffering.
{23530}{23578}And, um...
{23578}{23650}he kept insisting|and insisting
{23650}{23722}and then,well,|finally Ijust gave in,
{23722}{23770}and I hit him on the head|with a skillet,
{23770}{23866}then buried him|outatthe bulkhead.
{23914}{23962}Well, dig him up|if you don't believe me,
{23962}{24058}Sherlock.
{24154}{24226}Keough: Half mile up|there's a clearing.
{24226}{24274}What's with the water?|It's so black.
{24274}{24322}There's no waves|or anything.
{24322}{24370}Well,theywanted to|call it ''Lake Placid,''
{24370}{24466}butsomebody said|that name was taken.
{24466}{24538}It's too bad.
{24538}{24586}Tents were sent|ahead.
{24586}{24610}They should|already be set up
{24610}{24658}by the time|we getthere.
{24658}{24682}Tents?
{24682}{24706}We're staying|in tents?
{24706}{24778}I told you, 2 days|we'd have to camp.
{24778}{24826}Yes, camp,
{24826}{24850}but I thoughtthatmeant|''Ramada Inn.''
{24850}{24898}I never heard tents.|Will there be toilets?
{24898}{24946}Maybe we should|justtake you back.
{24946}{25018}Why, because|I prefer a toilet?
{25018}{25042}Oh, God.
{25042}{25090}We forgotto pack|feminine napkins.
{25090}{25114}Oh, so you're|with him now?
{25114}{25138}Taking his side.
{25138}{25186}I didn't|say a word.
{25186}{25234}Oh, no, maybe I should|justwipe myself
{25234}{25282}with some leafy little piece|of poison oak.
{25282}{25306}And then I could|spend the whole day
{25306}{25378}scratching my ass,|blending in with the natives.
{25378}{25426}Then you'd be back|on my side.
{25426}{25474}You know,you really|don't have to bother
{25474}{25522}telling people|you're from New York.
{25522}{25546}Whatthe hell|is that?
{25546}{25570}What?
{25570}{25666}There. I thought|I saw something.
{25666}{25738}Kelly:|Looks like a branch.
{25738}{25786}Oh, my God.
{25786}{25834}Aah!
{25834}{25858}Aah!
{25858}{25882}Hey.
{25882}{25930}You threw itatme!
{25930}{25954}Ijust let go of it.
{25954}{26002}You threw itatme!
{26002}{26026}Did you see that?|Oh!
{26026}{26050}Ma'am!
{26050}{26098}Stop hitting me.
{26098}{26122}Don'tthrow heads|atme!
{26122}{26170}Stop calling me|''ma'am!''
{26170}{26218}Aw,Jesus.
{26218}{26242}Oh, God.
{26242}{26314}So, sheriff...
{26314}{26410}howmany deputies you got?
{26482}{26578}What?
{26674}{26698}Could it be a bear?
{26698}{26746}I mean,the bears|get big here, right?
{26746}{26842}Hmm. I don'tthink a bear|could bite off a moose's head.
{26842}{26890}Everything you need|should be in there.
{26890}{26938}Ok. Good. Good.
{26938}{26962}So will we be|tent-mates then?
{26962}{27010}Nope.|This is allyours.
{27010}{27058}Ohh. Great.
{27058}{27082}Excellent.
{27082}{27106}Ifthere's anything else|you need...
{27106}{27154}Uh, one thing|I wanted to ask you.
{27154}{27202}Uh,what's it like|to be a woman
{27202}{27250}in the woods of Maine?
{27250}{27298}I mean,the guys don'tturn|all horny or anything
{27298}{27394}like they did in|Deliverance, right?
{27442}{27490}Oh.
{27490}{27538}I knewyou were there.
{27538}{27586}Hmm.
{27586}{27634}Never been to Maine|before, huh?
{27634}{27730}I have good hygiene.|I'm notwelcome.
{27730}{27754}Why are you here,|really?
{27754}{27802}I told you.
{27802}{27850}Amuseum doesn'tsend an|investigator into the woods--
{27850}{27874}Howwould you know
{27874}{27898}whata museum would|orwould not do exactly?
{27898}{27946}Well, even ifthey did,
{27946}{28018}I doubtwhether he or she|would have problems with tents.
{28018}{28042}So I don't like tents.|Why--
{28042}{28090}Oh,you don't like tents,|and you don't like mosquitoes.
{28090}{28114}Well, nobody likes|mosquit--
{28114}{28138}Look at|yourfingernails.
{28138}{28186}What's wrong|with my fingernails?
{28186}{28210}You have as much business|being in the woods
{28210}{28258}as Emily Post.
{28258}{28282}No, it doesn'tmake sense.
{28282}{28354}They sentyou out here|to examine a tooth.
{28354}{28450}And whatare you doing|out here on the lake?
{28450}{28498}Oh, no.
{28498}{28570}What?
{28570}{28666}Ifthis is|who I think it is...
{28666}{28690}It is.
{28690}{28738}Who?
{28738}{28762}Hector Cyr.
{28762}{28858}He's this rich, kook|mythology professor.
{28978}{29002}You know him?
{29002}{29050}He's done some work|with ourmuseum.
{29050}{29122}He also treks the world to s...
{29122}{29146}What?
{29146}{29242}To swim with crocodiles.
{29290}{29338}Crocodiles?
{29338}{29362}If he's here,

{55450}{55474}[grunts]
{55474}{55498}I losttrack.
{55498}{55594}We went different|directions.

{56698}{56722}-Grab him!|-Aah!

{56914}{56986}Yeah.
{56986}{57034}Nobody actually saw it.|It happened suddenly.
{57034}{57106}Didn't getcaught|in the outboard?
{57106}{57202}Itwasn'tthe outboard.
{57346}{57442}Tell them|to get here fast, huh?
{57490}{57562}You ok?
{57562}{57634}Kelly?
{57634}{57706}Yeah.
{57706}{57754}Nobody saw anything.
{57754}{57826}No.
{57826}{57874}U.S.Wildlife's|on theirway.
{57874}{57922}The police wantto keep|everything quiet
{57922}{57994}so the press doesn't|getwind of anything.
{57994}{58066}Everybody justwants us|to...
{58066}{58162}''Sittight.''
{58258}{58354}Are you...ok?
{58354}{58378}Well...
{58378}{58474}you know...
{58474}{58570}Yeah.
{58618}{58690}Well, Sheriff,|I'm, uh...
{58690}{58786}Very sorry|aboutyour deputy.
{58786}{58858}He was a good man?
{58858}{58954}Yep.
{58954}{59002}Whenever somebody dies,|I...
{59002}{59050}I always think|that it's such a waste
{59050}{59122}that I didn't knowthem|any better.
{59122}{59218}Sorry foryour loss,|Hector.
{59218}{59314}Not reallywhat I meant.
{59362}{59410}Head was just...
{59410}{59506}bitten off.
{59506}{59554}You know, I used to have|a recurring nightmare
{59554}{59602}that I was headless.
{59602}{59626}I'd be down|on the ground
{59626}{59674}looking up atmy body,|no head,
{59674}{59746}justwalking around|bumping into everything.
{59746}{59794}And my parents...
{59794}{59842}wouldn't letme|in the house.
{59842}{59890}Because they just bought|all these antique lamps,
{59890}{59914}and they didn'twantme|to knock them over,
{59914}{59938}the fuckers.
{59938}{60010}Then the neighborhood|bullies,
{60010}{60034}they'd see my round|head on the ground
{60034}{60082}looking like a ball,
{60082}{60106}and they'd come over,
{60106}{60154}and they'd start|a soccer game.
{60154}{60178}And as I was being|kicked around,
{60178}{60226}I'd actually|justfeel grateful
{60226}{60322}for being allowed|in the game.
{60346}{60394}Whatare--|whatare yourthoughts?
{60394}{60466}You know, Hector...
{60466}{60514}I'm sure|you're a fine person
{60514}{60586}in your own mental way,
{60586}{60610}but I think itwould be best
{60610}{60706}if you and I didn'tspeak.
{60754}{60802}Yaaah!
{60802}{60874}When is U.S.Wildlife|getting here?
{60874}{60970}I'm still waiting|to confirm ifthey...
{60994}{61066}Oh,Jesus.
{61066}{61114}I--I could probably|cut him down,
{61114}{61186}butthere's this|odd look of mayhem
{61186}{61258}on his|upside-down face.
{61258}{61282}Hank.
{61282}{61306}Yes?
{61306}{61354}Are you all right?
{61354}{61426}Could you cutme down?
{61426}{61450}Do you promise
{61450}{61474}thatyou won'tattempt|to injure me?
{61474}{61546}I have no interest in ever|looking atyou, Hector.
{61546}{61618}Ok.
{61618}{61666}Just, uh, pull him down.
{61666}{61762}It's a counterweight.
{61762}{61786}Here. I'll getthe knife.
{61786}{61834}If I'd remembered|itwas there,
{61834}{61882}I neverwould've let|you walk thatway.
{61882}{61906}I neverwould've let|you walk thatway.
{61930}{61954}All right. It's over.
{61954}{61978}It's over. Remember?
{61978}{62026}You promised|notto hurt him, so...
{62026}{62074}I lied.
{62074}{62098}Wait. Hey! Hey!
{62098}{62146}Come on! Hold up!
{62146}{62170}Nowhere to go,|my friend.
{62170}{62242}Now,just--come on!|Knock itoff.
{62242}{62266}Knock itoff.|Putthat down.
{62266}{62290}Justsettle...
{62290}{62338}[roaring]
{62338}{62410}Jesus! Look out!
{62410}{62482}Whoa!
{62482}{62578}[roaring]
{62674}{62770}Aw, shit!
{62770}{62866}[groaning]
{63178}{63226}Ok.
{63226}{63274}I admit it.
{63274}{63346}It's a crocodile.
{63346}{63394}Kelly: He's an Indo-Pacific.
{63394}{63466}Scales were oval.|He's an Asian crocodile.
{63466}{63538}Whywould he come here?|It's impossible.
{63538}{63586}Asia.|Howwould he get here?
{63586}{63634}Obviously some|asshole in Hong Kong
{63634}{63658}flushed him|down the toilet.
{63658}{63706}He was 30 feet, right?|Had to be.
{63706}{63778}Well, nowmaybe somebody's|happy I broughtmy big gun.
{63778}{63826}Oh you're gonna|blow him away now?
{63826}{63850}I should think so.
{63850}{63874}With your cannon?
{63874}{63898}Right.|What, I shouldn't?
{63898}{63922}Well, he's a miracle|of nature,
{63922}{63970}but I know|he's very scary.
{63970}{64018}You're the miracle|of nature.
{64018}{64066}Guys, guys, easy.
{64066}{64114}We're not gonna do|anything tonight.
{64114}{64186}I never heard of a crocodile|crossing an ocean.
{64186}{64234}Well,they conceal|information
{64234}{64258}like that in books.
{64258}{64282}All right, pal!
{64282}{64306}Hey, hey, hey.
{64306}{64378}No, no.|Let him go.
{64378}{64402}I'm sick|of him,too.
{64402}{64426}I do need to warn|you, Sheriff.
{64426}{64474}The thing|about being rich,
{64474}{64498}my parents did have|the added luxury
{64498}{64522}of ditching me off|at karate school
{64522}{64570}on a regular basis,|so I am a brown belt.
{64570}{64642}Go ahead.|Take your bestshot.
{64642}{64666}Ohh!
{64666}{64690}Hank!
{64690}{64738}He said he knew karate.
{64738}{64762}You hit him.
{64762}{64786}I did,yeah.
{64786}{64834}Here.
{64834}{64882}Did he say ''go''?
{64882}{64954}Aren'tyou supposed|to say ''go'' in karate?
{64954}{64978}You're supposed|to say ''go.''
{64978}{65050}Hank,just keep your|distance from him.
{65050}{65122}Go to yourtent.|Cool down.
{65122}{65170}He doesn'tanswer|my questions?
{65170}{65218}Why don'tyou|answermy questions?
{65218}{65242}I fall into a hole.
{65242}{65290}I go up in a tree.
{65290}{65314}I swearto God,|I'll say ''go.''
{65314}{65338}You bow,|and then you say ''go.''
{65338}{65362}As in|''go fuck yourself.''
{65362}{65434}Jesus.They're just|like children.
{65434}{65458}Yeah.
{65458}{65506}Oh, my God.
{65506}{65554}Are you all right?
{65554}{65602}Yeah, I'm all right.
{65602}{65626}I've gotsomething|forthat.
{65626}{65650}I can fix that.
{65650}{65674}Yeah?
{65674}{65698}Yeah.
{65698}{65722}Ohh!
{65722}{65794}Ijust gotta pull it|a little tighter.
{65794}{65842}There we go.
{65842}{65890}Who taughtyou|to be a nurse?
{65890}{65914}Father's a surgeon.
{65914}{65962}I can even stitch|in a pinch,
{65962}{66010}which probablywouldn't|be such a bad idea.
{66010}{66058}Uh, no,thanks.
{66058}{66106}Ok.
{66106}{66178}You should have seen|the look on yourface
{66178}{66250}when thatcroc jumped out.
{66250}{66274}Uh-huh.
{66274}{66322}You see the look|on the bear?
{66322}{66418}Thatwas the look.
{66418}{66466}I don't know.
{66466}{66514}The laws of nature|could be changing,Jack.
{66514}{66538}Thatthing outthere,|that's--
{66538}{66634}You're having the besttime|of your life, aren'tyou?
{66634}{66682}What?
{66682}{66706}What? People|have been killed.
{66706}{66778}I hardly think I'm|having a good time.
{66778}{66874}Whywould you--
{66874}{66970}Does itshow?
{67018}{67114}This is the firsttime|I've ever actually...
{67114}{67186}you know, been in|the middle of anything.
{67186}{67210}Is thatwhy you're here,
{67210}{67306}to get in the middle|of something?
{67354}{67426}Maybe.
{67426}{67474}I've always read|aboutwhat's happened.
{67474}{67570}I've never...
{67642}{67714}We should go to bed.
{67714}{67786}I mean we should|go to, uh...
{67786}{67810}rest.
{67810}{67882}We should go to our|separate tents,
{67882}{67954}and--here--|getsome--go.
{67954}{68050}I got it.
{68122}{68218}Thanks forthe bandage.
{68218}{68266}Night.
{68266}{68362}Yeah.
{68578}{68674}Cyr: It doesn'teven see him.
{68698}{68794}There, he got it.
{68794}{68842}He has one|natural enemy.
{68842}{68914}Only one.
{68914}{68938}Man?
{68938}{69010}Man.
{69010}{69034}So you're|the big expert.
{69034}{69106}You think ours is some|kind of mutantor---
{69106}{69178}Not necessarily.|There's a 30-footer in India.
{69178}{69250}Biggestone ever killed|on record was 27 feet.
{69250}{69322}So why is he here?
{69322}{69418}Honestly...
{69466}{69562}I don't know.
{70042}{70090}Keep your eyes peeled.
{70090}{70162}You know howfast|these things can be.
{70162}{70210}I've gotticks,|I know it.

{70450}{70474}What?
{70474}{70570}Jack.
{70690}{70786}That's a pretty big print.
{70954}{70978}Gare: Seems like|we're getting lower.
{70978}{71026}That's what happens|when I land.
{71026}{71074}Why are we landing?
{71074}{71170}Because this is the cove|that he obviously lives in.
{71170}{71242}So why are we landing?
{71242}{71338}Hector!
{71482}{71506}We can lift it?
{71506}{71554}Maybe.
{71554}{71578}Don'twant|to mush itthere.
{71578}{71626}I'm notmushing it.
{71626}{71698}You mightmush it.|It's a little soft.
{71698}{71794}For Christ's sake,|I'm notmushing it!

{72082}{72154}No, no, I keep|getting hitwith heads!
{72154}{72178}Try to calm down.
{72178}{72202}You calm down!
{72202}{72274}Calm down, ok?|Just keep breathing.
{72274}{72346}I'm being very calm!|I am composed!
{72346}{72370}This is the second time
{72370}{72394}I've been hit|with a severed head,
{72394}{72466}and it upsets me!
{72466}{72562}Whatthe hell?
{72610}{72682}Aah!
{72682}{72706}I...
{72706}{72778}Ijustwantto go back|to my tent now.
{72778}{72850}Can we please go back?
{72850}{72898}You gotta be kidding.
{72898}{72970}I'm not kidding!
{72970}{72994}Look.

{74026}{74098}Wow.
{74098}{74146}Disgusting.
{74146}{74194}I haven't broken any laws.
{74194}{74218}Oh, butyou have,|ma'am.
{74218}{74242}You lied to us.
{74242}{74290}Thatcan be|obstruction of justice.
{74290}{74314}Aman has been killed,
{74314}{74362}in part because|of your silence.
{74362}{74386}I could make out|a charge
{74386}{74410}of reckless|endangerment.
{74410}{74434}And I'm sure PETA|would be annoyed
{74434}{74506}at howyou treat|your cows.
{74506}{74554}The reason I lied,|if I told you the truth,
{74554}{74578}you'd hunt it down|and kill it,
{74578}{74626}which seems to be exactly|whatyou're trying to do.
{74626}{74674}How long have you|been feeding this thing?
{74674}{74722}6 years.
{74722}{74770}6 years?
{74770}{74842}Well, Bernie|was outfishing,
{74842}{74890}and itfollowed|him home.
{74890}{74938}So we threw it|some scraps,
{74938}{74986}and,well, he didn't|seem to bother anybody.
{74986}{75058}He became kind of like a pet|who lives in the wild.
{75058}{75082}He justappeared?
{75082}{75130}You have no idea|how he arrived here?
{75130}{75178}No. Do you?
{75178}{75226}Your husband Bernie,
{75226}{75250}you didn't,|by any chance,
{75250}{75298}lead him to the lake|blindfolded?
{75298}{75322}If I had a dick,
{75322}{75394}this is where I'd|tellyou to suck it.
{75394}{75442}Did the crocodile|killyour husband?
{75442}{75514}Yes, but itwas all...
{75514}{75538}itwas a mistake.
{75538}{75586}Amistake?
{75586}{75658}One of our horses|got loose 2 years ago.
{75658}{75706}Wentto the lake|to drink,
{75706}{75754}and the crocodile|started coming in,
{75754}{75802}and Bernie went|to intercede, and--
{75802}{75850}if I'd reported it,
{75850}{75922}they'd have sent people|to kill it.
{75922}{75970}Ma'am, how could you|not report this?
{75970}{75994}It puts human life|at risk.
{75994}{76042}Nobody lives on this lake.
{76042}{76138}It's really his lake now.
{76162}{76210}Come on, Hector.|I knowyou're crazy,
{76210}{76234}butyou can't do this.
{76234}{76282}I need to see his habitat|up close, Deputy Gare.
{76282}{76330}then watch Nova, ok?
{76330}{76402}But don't go|in the water.

{82066}{82114}You're grounded.
{82114}{82138}This is some very|delicate equipment
{82138}{82162}thatyou're|throwing around.
{82162}{82210}I don'tcare.|You trying to killyourself.
{82210}{82258}You wantto meet|yourmaker, is that it?
{82258}{82282}You mightthink|they're godly,
{82282}{82330}you might get|some spiritual lift
{82330}{82354}outof backstroking|with dragons,
{82354}{82426}butyou just puta deputy|at risk outthere, sir.
{82426}{82474}Let's notoverlook the fact|that he didn'teatme.

{83362}{83386}Hector.
{83386}{83434}Whatyou just did,
{83434}{83506}there had to be at leastsome|sort of a death wish going on.
{83506}{83554}In ancient Melanesia,
{83554}{83602}people suspected|of crimes
{83602}{83674}would be thrown|to the crocodiles.
{83674}{83698}Crocodiles would decide.
{83698}{83746}Theywould be the judge.
{83746}{83842}Oh, and so thatwas you|wanting to be judged outthere?
{83842}{83890}Maybe I was,|and so what?

{84130}{84178}There was more honesty|in those dragon's eyes.
{84178}{84226}There was more dignity|in those dragon's eyes.
{84226}{84250}Jesus, Hector,|cutthe shit.
{84250}{84298}Aw,fuck it.
{84298}{84394}So, can I tell them you won't|go back in the water?
{84394}{84418}Oh,yeah, sure.
{84418}{84442}I'm not going|back in the water.
{84442}{84490}No way I'm going|back in the water.
{84490}{84538}Ok.

{85042}{85066}Everything?
{85066}{85090}Yeah.
{85090}{85114}All right.
{85114}{85186}Just heard from Wildlife|and Florida Fish and Game.
{85186}{85210}They're gonna be here|in 3 hours.
{85210}{85258}Ok.
{85258}{85306}So we mightas well pack up.
{85306}{85354}Good idea.
{85354}{85426}Will they|try to trap him?
{85426}{85450}Sorry?
{85450}{85498}Florida Fish and Game.
{85498}{85546}What'll they do|when they get here?
{85546}{85642}Cyr:Tell her,Jack.
{85642}{85714}Won't be able to snag him|in pitments, right?
{85714}{85762}And you tranq him|in the water,
{85762}{85786}and he drowns.
{85786}{85834}They could try|to tranq him on land.
{85834}{85882}Oh, sure,they could,|buttheywon't.
{85882}{85906}He's taken human life.
{85906}{85930}The mission will be|to put him down.
{85930}{85978}Is thattrue?
{85978}{86074}They've never been able|to trap anything 30 feet.
{86074}{86122}Butthey have|to try, right?
{86122}{86170}Where are they gonna|take him, Florida?
{86170}{86194}Back to Asia?
{86194}{86242}I gotenough flaxidyl|with me to put him out--
{86242}{86266}Forget it.
{86266}{86338}Jack, hearme out.
{86338}{86362}I know I'm a fat,|rich, nutfuck,wacko
{86362}{86410}who's aboutas grounded|as a street pigeon,
{86410}{86458}Keep going.
{86458}{86506}Butthis thing...
{86506}{86554}Here?

{86626}{86650}30 feet?
{86650}{86698}Don'tyou think|we're dealing
{86698}{86746}with a bit|of a miracle?
{86746}{86794}Yeah.The miracle would be|to take him alive.
{86794}{86842}Yeah, but ifwe could|neutralize him--
{86842}{86866}How are we gonna|neutralize him?
{86866}{86914}Lure him on land|and pump him full of drugs.
{86914}{86938}Oh, right.
{86938}{86986}I know of an empty|oil tank in Portland.
{86986}{87034}Ifwe drugged him,we|could contain him there.
{87034}{87082}He's 150 years old.
{87082}{87178}He probably swam here|from another continent.
{87178}{87226}He's migrated to Maine.
{87226}{87298}Howthe hell do we say|we just kill it?
{87298}{87346}Jack,|this thing being here
{87346}{87394}does have some|ecological significance.
{87394}{87442}And you are|in the business
{87442}{87490}of protecting things|againstextinction.
{87490}{87538}Including deputies.
{87538}{87562}I understand that,
{87562}{87610}but if it's possible|to take him alive--
{87610}{87634}No, it's not possible.
{87634}{87682}Look, he follows anything|thatmoves, right?
{87682}{87754}We seta trap on the beach.|I gotenough net--
{87754}{87802}No.There's no net|that's gonna hold him.
{87802}{87826}It'll keep him|tangled long enough

{87874}{87898}For God's sake,Jack,
{87898}{87946}they've trapped crocs|biggerthan 20 feet.
{87946}{88018}This is notcompletely|outofthe question.
{88018}{88042}It's possible,|and you knowthat.
{88042}{88090}And those fucks from|Florida won'teven try,

{88162}{88210}I gotthe drugs.|He's gota big cannon

{88282}{88330}How do you get him|to the net?
{88330}{88378}Ask Mrs. Bickerman|to call him?
{88378}{88402}You guys can be|in the trucks

{88426}{88450}If he charges,|you take off.
{88450}{88498}He's notthatfast.
