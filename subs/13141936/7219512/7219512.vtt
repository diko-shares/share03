2
00:01:09.551 --> 00:01:10.718
Hey.

3
00:02:17.095 --> 00:02:18.510
Where are we going?

4
00:02:20.678 --> 00:02:22.510
Kata forbid.
How could you?

5
00:02:22.552 --> 00:02:25.094
Night like this, how couldn't I?

6
00:02:25.136 --> 00:02:28.886
Don't you feel it?
Don't you feel the energy?

7
00:02:33.761 --> 00:02:35.679
You mustn't.

8
00:02:35.721 --> 00:02:38.928
She disagrees.
She's calling.

9
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.094
All sorts of vermin
be hearing that call too.

10
00:02:41.136 --> 00:02:42.594
Nonsense.

11
00:02:42.636 --> 00:02:44.553
Not nonsense.
What happened to Mel?

12
00:02:44.595 --> 00:02:45.553
Smallpox.

13
00:02:45.595 --> 00:02:47.804
That wasn't smallpox.

14
00:02:51.136 --> 00:02:53.679
Something's out there.
That's why Kata...

15
00:02:53.721 --> 00:02:55.261
Hush!

16
00:02:59.137 --> 00:03:00.804
Those expose the soul.

17
00:03:00.846 --> 00:03:02.804
How else can it fly?

18
00:03:06.637 --> 00:03:08.012
Silly girl.

19
00:03:08.054 --> 00:03:10.137
You call what you are.

20
00:05:18.014 --> 00:05:19.848
Oh, fuck!

21
00:06:30.225 --> 00:06:33.683
Happy birthday, Sis.

22
00:06:33.725 --> 00:06:37.808
Aw!
Oh, you didn't have to.

23
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:39.725
Oh, come on.

24
00:06:43.975 --> 00:06:46.349
Ah!

25
00:06:46.391 --> 00:06:48.726
Mm, mm.

26
00:07:05.851 --> 00:07:08.059
Oh, what a day.

27
00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:19.060
- You okay?
- What?

28
00:08:23.311 --> 00:08:24.935
Never mind.

29
00:08:41.353 --> 00:08:43.226
Hey!

30
00:08:43.268 --> 00:08:45.602
Can you come get me, please?

31
00:08:45.644 --> 00:08:47.602
I'm not feeling well.

32
00:08:47.644 --> 00:08:49.977
Okay.
Sure.

33
00:08:50.019 --> 00:08:51.228
See you soon.

34
00:08:54.436 --> 00:08:56.519
Hey, babe.
How's it goin'?

35
00:08:56.561 --> 00:08:58.144
I'm gonna go pick up Delfi.

36
00:08:58.186 --> 00:09:00.061
Oh, for Christ's sake.

37
00:09:00.103 --> 00:09:01.270
She's not feeling well.

38
00:09:01.312 --> 00:09:03.644
Again?

39
00:09:03.686 --> 00:09:05.977
She's not gonna
take the fuckin' bus?

40
00:09:06.019 --> 00:09:07.644
Don't you see
what's happening here?

41
00:09:07.686 --> 00:09:09.520
Enlighten me.

42
00:09:09.562 --> 00:09:11.312
She's dead weight.

43
00:09:14.228 --> 00:09:16.603
Fuck.

44
00:09:41.228 --> 00:09:43.145
Delfi!

45
00:09:43.187 --> 00:09:44.562
Hello?

46
00:09:48.062 --> 00:09:50.354
Why didn't you
wait for me at the store?

47
00:09:50.396 --> 00:09:52.313
Thanks for coming.

48
00:09:52.355 --> 00:09:54.103
You okay?
You sound a little...

49
00:09:54.145 --> 00:09:55.480
Just tired.

50
00:10:01.271 --> 00:10:02.978
Gonna stop
for some wine and stuff.

51
00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:04.438
I've got friends
coming over later.

52
00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.729
I'm tired, Andra.

53
00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:08.688
Oh, pep up.

54
00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:10.646
A little party
is just what you need.

55
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:14.646
Yeah.

56
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:30.189
Hey!
Work happening here.

57
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:31.480
Uh, coming.

58
00:10:43.105 --> 00:10:44.563
Hi. You look awesome.

59
00:10:44.605 --> 00:10:47.604
Thanks.

60
00:10:47.646 --> 00:10:50.231
- You doin' better?
- Oh, yeah.

61
00:10:51.522 --> 00:10:53.231
What was it before?

62
00:10:57.231 --> 00:10:59.272
Tony coming?

63
00:10:59.314 --> 00:11:00.980
Nah, I'm done with him.

64
00:11:02.772 --> 00:11:05.314
Oh, Tony.
Poor Tony.

65
00:11:08.481 --> 00:11:12.147
You never liked him anyways.

66
00:11:25.148 --> 00:11:28.190
Nice job!

67
00:11:28.232 --> 00:11:30.647
I don't know how
I'm gonna survive this class.

68
00:11:30.689 --> 00:11:32.106
Heinz is a nightmare.

69
00:11:32.148 --> 00:11:33.647
I'm actually
enjoying Heinz's class.

70
00:11:33.689 --> 00:11:37.481
- He's such a drag.
- No, I love studying Erikson.

71
00:11:37.523 --> 00:11:39.022
Erikson's old school.

72
00:11:39.064 --> 00:11:40.565
Oh, yeah right!
I don't think so.

73
00:11:40.606 --> 00:11:42.647
I wrote my dissertation
on modern Eriksonian.

74
00:11:42.689 --> 00:11:44.398
And I bet you slayed that.

75
00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.523
Yeah, I'm getting
my PhD in the fall.

76
00:11:46.565 --> 00:11:48.106
Oh, at Yale I presume?

77
00:11:48.148 --> 00:11:49.315
San Serra, actually.

78
00:11:49.357 --> 00:11:50.773
- You got in!?
- You got it!?

79
00:11:50.814 --> 00:11:52.481
Oh, just keep it low key, okay?

80
00:11:52.523 --> 00:11:54.148
Andra's going to California!

81
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:57.148
Shh! No, no, I haven't
decided yet.

82
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:58.773
Wouldn't take me
very long to decide.

83
00:11:58.815 --> 00:12:00.440
Oh, California?
Like a millisecond.

84
00:12:00.482 --> 00:12:03.231
Shh!
Don't tell anyone, okay?

85
00:12:03.273 --> 00:12:05.690
Ah.
Ooh!

86
00:12:19.732 --> 00:12:21.191
Okay.

87
00:12:21.233 --> 00:12:22.606
Dear, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

88
00:12:36.399 --> 00:12:38.815
"..very limited spots."

89
00:12:38.857 --> 00:12:41.233
"Unfortunately..."

90
00:13:06.483 --> 00:13:08.192
Where are we going?

91
00:13:10.483 --> 00:13:12.317
Kata forbid.
How could you?

92
00:13:12.359 --> 00:13:14.524
Night like this, how couldn't I?

93
00:13:21.774 --> 00:13:24.192
Something's out there.
That's why Kata...

94
00:13:24.234 --> 00:13:25.358
Hush!

95
00:13:27.359 --> 00:13:28.483
You mustn't.

96
00:13:28.525 --> 00:13:31.359
She disagrees.
She's calling.

97
00:13:51.484 --> 00:13:53.817
Delfi, stop!
Stop!

98
00:14:15.526 --> 00:14:18.526
Delfi, talk to me.

99
00:14:18.568 --> 00:14:20.651
Delfi, what the fuck happened?

100
00:14:20.693 --> 00:14:23.526
I'm worried about you.
This feels like two years ago.

101
00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:29.944
Okay, look, I know you've been
struggling with something,

102
00:14:29.985 --> 00:14:32.485
but you really need
to tell me what's going on.

103
00:14:35.568 --> 00:14:37.318
I can't.

104
00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.693
Why?

105
00:14:45.318 --> 00:14:46.526
I've been seeing things.

106
00:14:52.319 --> 00:14:54.526
Oh, Delfi, not again.

107
00:14:54.568 --> 00:14:56.526
Why didn't
you tell me it was back?

108
00:15:01.361 --> 00:15:04.319
Okay, listen, Delfi.
We'll go back to therapy.

109
00:15:04.361 --> 00:15:05.859
I know some professors
at the college.

110
00:15:05.901 --> 00:15:07.734
Great people.
All of them.

111
00:15:07.776 --> 00:15:11.486
You'll have your pick, okay?
We'll get you a new doctor.

112
00:15:14.611 --> 00:15:16.694
I have one.

113
00:15:16.736 --> 00:15:17.903
Who?

114
00:15:21.694 --> 00:15:23.861
Often unresolved issues, pain,

115
00:15:23.903 --> 00:15:27.444
fear, regret,
manifest as delusions,

116
00:15:27.486 --> 00:15:29.360
or hallucinations.

117
00:15:29.402 --> 00:15:31.444
If these issues
lie in the subconscious,

118
00:15:31.486 --> 00:15:34.319
hypnosis can be
a window onto them.

119
00:15:34.361 --> 00:15:36.736
So, just relax
while I set things up.

120
00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:42.527
Do you know Forging Mind?

121
00:15:45.403 --> 00:15:47.486
He's a digital artist
from Australia.

122
00:15:47.527 --> 00:15:49.903
Motion art therapy,
meditative visuals,

123
00:15:49.945 --> 00:15:51.278
stuff like that.

124
00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.736
Great guy.

125
00:16:01.612 --> 00:16:02.945
So, Delfi.

126
00:16:06.945 --> 00:16:09.403
I want you
to imagine you're a bird...

127
00:16:14.946 --> 00:16:17.445
..flying over
the story of your life.

128
00:16:21.362 --> 00:16:22.863
You're safe in the air.

129
00:16:25.612 --> 00:16:27.445
Nothing can hurt you.

130
00:16:30.695 --> 00:16:32.570
You can see all of your past.

131
00:16:42.571 --> 00:16:44.446
We are one of a kind!

132
00:16:51.113 --> 00:16:53.529
Do you feel safe?

133
00:16:53.571 --> 00:16:54.988
Yes.

134
00:17:04.779 --> 00:17:08.822
I'm going to ask
about your hallucinations now.

135
00:17:08.864 --> 00:17:10.529
When did they begin?

136
00:17:13.529 --> 00:17:14.779
In the womb.

137
00:17:18.155 --> 00:17:20.738
Are they triggered
by anything in particular?

138
00:17:23.155 --> 00:17:24.613
When it comes.

139
00:17:26.488 --> 00:17:30.030
Is "it" something
your mind has constructed?

140
00:17:30.072 --> 00:17:32.447
No.

141
00:17:32.489 --> 00:17:35.822
Where is "it" from then?

142
00:17:35.864 --> 00:17:37.364
What is "it"?

143
00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:46.530
It is...

144
00:17:51.572 --> 00:17:53.572
It's here.

145
00:17:55.781 --> 00:17:57.488
Where?

146
00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:00.613
Touching my hair.

147
00:18:00.655 --> 00:18:01.781
Back!

148
00:18:09.697 --> 00:18:11.198
I'm not equipped to deal

149
00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:12.698
with these types of things.

150
00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:14.823
But I'll refer you
to someone else,

151
00:18:14.865 --> 00:18:16.990
someone very gifted.

152
00:18:20.073 --> 00:18:22.156
Pat Banfi?

153
00:18:22.198 --> 00:18:23.823
She's a spiritualist.

154
00:18:29.823 --> 00:18:32.573
That was just insane.

155
00:18:32.615 --> 00:18:34.073
You're so narrow minded.

156
00:18:34.115 --> 00:18:36.031
No, I'm not, but come on.

157
00:18:38.031 --> 00:18:39.448
I wanna see this Pat.

158
00:18:41.115 --> 00:18:42.699
We're going to a proper doctor.

159
00:18:42.741 --> 00:18:44.073
- Give me Pat's number.
- No, why?

160
00:18:44.115 --> 00:18:46.073
It's just gonna
be more of that bullshit.

161
00:18:46.115 --> 00:18:47.531
Give me her number!

162
00:18:47.573 --> 00:18:50.907
Okay, no, Delfi.
You had an episode.

163
00:18:50.949 --> 00:18:53.239
You're seeing things.
You need proper help.

164
00:18:53.281 --> 00:18:56.531
Please, you need medication.

165
00:18:56.573 --> 00:18:58.824
And that's okay.

166
00:18:58.866 --> 00:19:00.573
Fuck you!

167
00:19:03.741 --> 00:19:05.157
Delfi!

168
00:19:33.867 --> 00:19:35.115
Hello?

169
00:19:35.157 --> 00:19:37.741
Hi, um, Dr. Smith
gave me your number.

170
00:19:37.783 --> 00:19:40.490
It's great to
finally speak to you.

171
00:19:40.532 --> 00:19:42.574
It's not about me.
It's about my sister.

172
00:19:42.616 --> 00:19:44.282
It is about you.

173
00:19:44.324 --> 00:19:45.866
Excuse me?

174
00:19:45.908 --> 00:19:47.991
I know you're scared, Andra.

175
00:19:48.033 --> 00:19:48.991
You should be.

176
00:19:49.033 --> 00:19:50.658
How do you know my name?

177
00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:53.075
I've been expecting this call.

178
00:19:53.117 --> 00:19:55.866
Let me talk you through things.

179
00:19:55.908 --> 00:19:58.033
First, just let me
know who you are.

180
00:19:58.075 --> 00:20:00.825
I know your nights are restless.

181
00:20:00.867 --> 00:20:04.825
You're beginning
to sense a new reality.

182
00:20:04.867 --> 00:20:08.741
One you'll face without Delfi.

183
00:20:08.783 --> 00:20:12.742
Is this some little game
you set up with Dr. Smith?

184
00:20:12.783 --> 00:20:15.033
You've
always been the strong one.

185
00:20:15.075 --> 00:20:17.617
It makes sense for you
to carry the burden now.

186
00:20:17.659 --> 00:20:19.158
What do you mean
"carry the burden?"

187
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.659
My sister is the one who's sick.
I'm trying to help her get well.

188
00:20:22.701 --> 00:20:24.158
There's little time.

189
00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.867
You must be prepared
for what's coming.

190
00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:27.200
This is crazy.

191
00:20:27.242 --> 00:20:29.659
I know what's wrong with Delfi,

192
00:20:29.701 --> 00:20:30.992
how she can be saved,

193
00:20:31.034 --> 00:20:33.200
how you're the only
one who can do it.

194
00:20:33.242 --> 00:20:36.201
Please, you must listen to me.

195
00:20:36.243 --> 00:20:39.117
I'm not listening to anything
until you tell me who you are

196
00:20:39.159 --> 00:20:41.659
and how you know
about me and my sister.

197
00:20:41.701 --> 00:20:43.034
A friend.

198
00:20:43.076 --> 00:20:44.701
That's all that's
important for now.

199
00:20:44.743 --> 00:20:46.242
I'm a friend.

200
00:20:48.034 --> 00:20:50.576
Let's try another way.

201
00:20:50.618 --> 00:20:53.659
It's hard because you've
ignored the truth for so long.

202
00:20:53.701 --> 00:20:57.660
But now,
just between us, admit it.

203
00:20:57.701 --> 00:21:02.660
You know she's not sick.
Something does haunt her.

204
00:21:09.951 --> 00:21:11.868
Maybe a few times.

205
00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:13.702
Go on.

206
00:21:13.744 --> 00:21:15.827
I'm not even sure
what I saw.

207
00:21:15.869 --> 00:21:20.284
Or didn't see
what it was.

208
00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:33.285
I was very young.
I'm not even sure.

209
00:21:33.327 --> 00:21:37.827
Um, I'm about seven years old

210
00:21:37.869 --> 00:21:39.410
playing with Delfi.

211
00:22:04.995 --> 00:22:06.661
Did you see?

212
00:22:06.703 --> 00:22:08.202
Okay, can you please
just tell me

213
00:22:08.244 --> 00:22:10.285
what I can do to help my sister?

214
00:22:10.327 --> 00:22:14.119
Until you see,
it'll keep focus on her.

215
00:22:14.161 --> 00:22:15.744
I don't understand.

216
00:22:15.786 --> 00:22:17.285
You will soon.

217
00:22:17.327 --> 00:22:19.203
- Please!
- I'll set a lantern.

218
00:22:19.245 --> 00:22:20.786
A lantern?

219
00:22:20.828 --> 00:22:22.744
What does that
have to do with anything?

220
00:22:22.786 --> 00:22:25.078
The lantern will
lead you there.

221
00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:27.411
You said you were
a friend and we need help.

222
00:22:27.453 --> 00:22:30.119
Delfi's burden
will pass when you see.

223
00:22:30.161 --> 00:22:31.869
Maybe we can meet face-to-face.

224
00:22:31.911 --> 00:22:34.286
We will
meet face-to-face soon enough.

225
00:22:34.328 --> 00:22:38.786
But now,
you must find the lantern.

226
00:22:41.828 --> 00:22:44.828
What?
Oh, shit.

227
00:23:27.287 --> 00:23:28.996
Delfi?

228
00:23:56.872 --> 00:23:58.247
Delfi!?

229
00:24:07.038 --> 00:24:07.996
Delfi?

230
00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:45.581
Oh, my God!

231
00:24:45.623 --> 00:24:48.247
No!
Delfi!

232
00:24:48.288 --> 00:24:51.331
I'm not here.

233
00:24:55.248 --> 00:24:56.956
Delfi! Delfi!

234
00:24:56.998 --> 00:24:58.332
Delfi, stay with me.

235
00:24:58.374 --> 00:25:00.290
Come on.
Come on, Delfi.

236
00:25:13.956 --> 00:25:17.914
- Oh!
- Shh!

237
00:25:23.665 --> 00:25:26.206
- I was trapped.
- Mm-hm.

238
00:25:26.248 --> 00:25:29.247
- It got me.
- It's okay.

239
00:25:29.289 --> 00:25:31.540
Okay? Everything is okay.

240
00:25:36.582 --> 00:25:39.332
You don't understand.

241
00:25:39.374 --> 00:25:41.498
It's gonna keep me forever.

242
00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:43.373
And I'll still be alive.

243
00:25:43.415 --> 00:25:45.415
Oh, Delfi,
you're not making any sense.

244
00:25:45.457 --> 00:25:49.957
No, listen!
No, listen to me!

245
00:25:49.999 --> 00:25:53.207
It's getting closer every night.

246
00:25:53.249 --> 00:25:55.998
It's getting
closer every night.

247
00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:57.874
Last night, tonight.

248
00:26:00.666 --> 00:26:03.374
Tomorrow's a full moon.
It'll get me for sure.

249
00:26:07.625 --> 00:26:10.458
I gotta end it now.

250
00:26:11.708 --> 00:26:12.708
Delfi, no!

251
00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:14.374
You can't stop me!

252
00:26:14.416 --> 00:26:17.040
Under hypnosis you said
it was with you in the womb.

253
00:26:17.082 --> 00:26:18.999
If that's true,
then the connection to you

254
00:26:19.041 --> 00:26:20.374
predates your birth
and killing yourself

255
00:26:20.416 --> 00:26:21.916
won't solve anything!

256
00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:28.916
What am I gonna do?

257
00:26:30.958 --> 00:26:35.708
What am I gonna do?

258
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:40.916
Shh, shh, shh.

259
00:27:17.626 --> 00:27:20.334
- That smell.
- What smell?

260
00:27:24.084 --> 00:27:25.293
Where did you get this?

261
00:27:25.335 --> 00:27:28.335
A friend gave it to me
from North Bay.

262
00:27:41.293 --> 00:27:43.376
North Bay? North Bay?

263
00:27:43.418 --> 00:27:46.000
Yeah.

264
00:27:48.126 --> 00:27:49.460
Delfi.

265
00:28:05.418 --> 00:28:06.710
I know this place.

266
00:28:11.335 --> 00:28:13.418
Oh, Delfi,
this looks familiar to me too.

267
00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:15.543
You're confusing memories
of when we went to camp

268
00:28:15.585 --> 00:28:17.127
after Mom and Dad died.

269
00:28:17.169 --> 00:28:18.668
No,
it was a different time

270
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:20.585
before any of this shit
happened to me.

271
00:28:20.627 --> 00:28:23.252
I'm telling you I've been there.

272
00:28:23.294 --> 00:28:25.169
There's a river
with a trail that leads

273
00:28:25.211 --> 00:28:26.419
to a forest of birches.

274
00:28:27.544 --> 00:28:29.461
I've been there.

275
00:28:29.503 --> 00:28:31.294
Okay.

276
00:28:34.294 --> 00:28:36.211
North Bay's only
a couple hours from here.

277
00:29:33.795 --> 00:29:35.795
It's even better
than the picture online.

278
00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:11.338
Oh, wow.

279
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:15.837
Told you we shoulda come.

280
00:30:23.296 --> 00:30:28.296
There's even tea.

281
00:30:52.546 --> 00:30:54.172
I know you think I'm crazy.

282
00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:58.589
No, Delfi.

283
00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:00.879
I don't think you're crazy.

284
00:31:00.921 --> 00:31:03.464
- Okay?
- Okay.

285
00:31:08.714 --> 00:31:11.422
I do think...

286
00:31:11.464 --> 00:31:14.672
♪ That you're losing
your freakin' mind ♪

287
00:31:14.714 --> 00:31:16.839

"Went walking."

295
00:35:06.469 --> 00:35:09.760
Ugh, thanks for waiting.

296
00:35:12.802 --> 00:35:16.677
Oh, Andra!
I was...

297
00:35:16.719 --> 00:35:18.969
Shh!

298
00:35:21.636 --> 00:35:24.969
It was a group of us.

299
00:35:25.011 --> 00:35:28.678
We were witches.

300
00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:31.803
And we had it.

301
00:35:31.845 --> 00:35:34.135
We had the power.

302
00:35:34.177 --> 00:35:37.552
We had the power,
the power of the world.

303
00:35:37.594 --> 00:35:41.011
The power?

304
00:35:41.053 --> 00:35:44.552
Yeah. Don't you feel it?

305
00:35:44.594 --> 00:35:47.095
Don't you feel the energy?

306
00:35:47.137 --> 00:35:48.678
Shh!

307
00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:51.887
Don't you feel it?
Don't you feel the energy?

308
00:35:53.636 --> 00:35:54.803
We mustn't.

309
00:36:02.762 --> 00:36:04.886
And there was...
There was Kata.

310
00:36:07.887 --> 00:36:10.595
And she was our leader.

311
00:36:10.637 --> 00:36:14.511
Kata.
Oh, Kata?

312
00:36:14.553 --> 00:36:16.178
Kata!

313
00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:17.929
- Kata, wait!
- Delfi!

314
00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:20.637
- Kata, it's me!
- Delfi, enough!

315
00:36:20.679 --> 00:36:22.721
- You don't understand!
- No, you don't understand.

316
00:36:22.763 --> 00:36:24.261
We need to go to the hospital.

317
00:36:24.303 --> 00:36:26.303
- I've never felt better!
- You're dissociating.

318
00:36:26.345 --> 00:36:28.637
You need help now or you could
remain delusional.

319
00:36:28.679 --> 00:36:30.137
No, no, this is real!

320
00:36:30.179 --> 00:36:32.679
I can't.
I can't do this anymore!

321
00:36:32.721 --> 00:36:34.179
No, don't be scared.
I'll show you.

322
00:36:34.221 --> 00:36:37.304
- No, I'm going home.
- This is home.

323
00:36:37.345 --> 00:36:38.887
Delfi, I'm sorry.

324
00:36:38.929 --> 00:36:41.179
You can come with me
if you want or not,

325
00:36:41.221 --> 00:36:42.637
but I've gotta go!

326
00:36:42.679 --> 00:36:44.846
No! Come on!

327
00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:50.888
- You see?
- Let's get out of here!

328
00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:52.598
- It's okay.
- We go to the city.

329
00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:54.138
We go straight
to the hospital, okay?

330
00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:56.305
- Okay!
- Okay.

331
00:37:56.347 --> 00:38:00.388
If you still want to.

332
00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:02.263
After I take you somewhere.

333
00:38:02.305 --> 00:38:04.263
No! Delfi, no!
I'm tired. I'm cold.

334
00:38:04.305 --> 00:38:05.973
And I'm getting
really freaked out here!

335
00:38:06.015 --> 00:38:07.388
J-J-Just let me
take you somewhere.

336
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:09.889
And then I vow,
I promise on our parents' souls,

337
00:38:09.931 --> 00:38:11.723
whatever you say.

338
00:38:11.765 --> 00:38:13.223
- Please.
- Fuck, fine.

339
00:38:20.973 --> 00:38:22.389
Where are you taking me?

340
00:38:22.431 --> 00:38:24.723
To the most
amazing place in the world.

341
00:38:24.765 --> 00:38:26.098
- You'll see.
- Delfi, listen.

342
00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:29.264
I'm not...
I'm not feeling very well.

343
00:38:29.306 --> 00:38:32.139
I think I'm the one
who needs to go to the hospital.

344
00:38:32.181 --> 00:38:34.431
Ah, you're just scared.

345
00:38:34.473 --> 00:38:36.306
I don't know.

346
00:38:36.348 --> 00:38:38.223
I don't know
what to believe anymore.

347
00:38:38.265 --> 00:38:40.682
Sure, you do.
That's why you're scared.

348
00:38:40.724 --> 00:38:42.223
Trust me.

349
00:38:42.265 --> 00:38:44.889
As bad as it gets,
the flip's just as brilliant.

350
00:38:44.931 --> 00:38:46.807
I don't understand.

351
00:38:46.849 --> 00:38:51.181
You will.
As soon as you see this place.

352
00:38:51.223 --> 00:38:54.181
Well, what's
so special about it?

353
00:38:54.223 --> 00:38:56.807
It's where
we used to practice.

354
00:38:56.849 --> 00:38:59.140
A place of power.

355
00:38:59.181 --> 00:39:02.140
A place of power
in downtown North Bay?

356
00:39:02.182 --> 00:39:05.306
We're getting close.
I can feel it.

357
00:39:05.348 --> 00:39:06.765
Shit, Delfi.

358
00:39:12.932 --> 00:39:14.057
Nothing's here.

359
00:39:17.016 --> 00:39:18.807
This is it.

360
00:39:18.849 --> 00:39:20.724
Oh, I'd find it blindfolded.

361
00:39:23.307 --> 00:39:24.849
911.

362
00:39:24.891 --> 00:39:26.390
Hi, we have
a psychiatric emergency.

363
00:39:26.432 --> 00:39:28.349
- One moment, please.
- For fuck's sake, Delfi.

364
00:39:38.307 --> 00:39:41.099
You must find the lantern.

365
00:39:44.517 --> 00:39:45.975
This is just a dream.

366
00:39:55.267 --> 00:39:57.183
Andra!

367
00:39:57.225 --> 00:39:58.516
Andra, look.
Look, look.

368
00:39:58.558 --> 00:40:01.016
See, see? People... people still
come here.

369
00:40:01.058 --> 00:40:02.516
Oh, my gosh.

370
00:40:02.558 --> 00:40:03.891
Imagine.

371
00:40:03.933 --> 00:40:05.975
This, this used
to be all forest.

372
00:40:06.017 --> 00:40:07.308
Okay, okay.

373
00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:09.517
I can't believe
I'm back here!

374
00:40:21.017 --> 00:40:22.850
Isn't it something?

375
00:40:31.267 --> 00:40:34.392
Well, how big is this place?

376
00:40:34.434 --> 00:40:37.017
It doesn't stop.

377
00:41:04.394 --> 00:41:07.101
What's happening here?

378
00:41:07.143 --> 00:41:08.602
Nothing.

379
00:41:12.184 --> 00:41:14.059
You're blushing.

380
00:41:14.101 --> 00:41:16.143
Really?

381
00:41:19.852 --> 00:41:21.142
He's coming over.

382
00:41:21.184 --> 00:41:22.852
Okay.

383
00:41:26.101 --> 00:41:28.477
Okay. So, like,
you know that feeling

384
00:41:28.519 --> 00:41:30.977
when you feel like
you know somebody

385
00:41:31.019 --> 00:41:33.060
but you just met? It's...

386
00:41:33.102 --> 00:41:34.935
I'm Sid.

387
00:41:34.977 --> 00:41:36.477
Andra.

388
00:41:36.519 --> 00:41:39.019
Andra? Nice to meet you.

389
00:41:41.519 --> 00:41:43.518
- Special place.
- Yeah. So I hear.

390
00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:46.102
I was actually in the middle of
backpacking across Canada.

391
00:41:46.144 --> 00:41:48.268
And then, these guys
at the hostel in Toronto

392
00:41:48.310 --> 00:41:50.227
were, like,
"Come check this place out."

393
00:41:50.269 --> 00:41:52.185
And I was, like,
"Yeah, sure. Why not?"

394
00:41:52.227 --> 00:41:56.102
So, I've been here every night
for, like, a week now.

395
00:41:56.144 --> 00:41:57.977
We just arrived yesterday.

396
00:41:58.019 --> 00:41:59.935
Oh. Well, are you staying
in town, or...

397
00:41:59.977 --> 00:42:04.143
A bit out, actually.
Um, it's a really pretty...

398
00:42:04.185 --> 00:42:05.644
You should come check it out.

399
00:42:05.686 --> 00:42:07.227
Fossmill Cabin.

400
00:42:07.269 --> 00:42:09.311
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

401
00:42:09.353 --> 00:42:11.311
I feel like I know you.

402
00:42:11.353 --> 00:42:12.686
Right. Like you do.

403
00:42:12.728 --> 00:42:14.227
Yeah.

404
00:42:14.269 --> 00:42:16.185
Right. See what I mean?
Like, you're just...

405
00:42:16.227 --> 00:42:17.436
- Familiar.
- Yeah.

406
00:42:17.478 --> 00:42:19.103
You're just different.

407
00:42:19.144 --> 00:42:21.436
You probably get that
all the time, though.

408
00:42:21.478 --> 00:42:24.978
I don't, actually. Thanks.

409
00:42:31.561 --> 00:42:32.894
You okay?

410
00:42:32.936 --> 00:42:34.354
Great.

411
00:42:36.312 --> 00:42:38.395
- I can't think straight.
- Oh, my God.

412
00:42:39.686 --> 00:42:42.270
- Oh, this place is alive.
- Yeah.

413
00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:47.270
I want to go there.

414
00:42:48.646 --> 00:42:50.228
- Let's go there.
- Okay.

415
00:43:26.438 --> 00:43:29.438
One. And I am the same.

416
00:43:30.646 --> 00:43:34.646
And I am the same. One.

417
00:44:00.105 --> 00:44:01.521
Andra!

418
00:44:14.522 --> 00:44:16.563
All good?

419
00:44:16.605 --> 00:44:19.356
I...

420
00:44:19.398 --> 00:44:23.105
It's just... Oh, my God.

421
00:44:23.147 --> 00:44:24.481
That was amazing.

422
00:44:24.523 --> 00:44:27.021
I just saw the light.
Did you see it, too?

423
00:44:27.063 --> 00:44:31.647
It was like past, present
and future, all here, right now.

424
00:44:31.689 --> 00:44:35.481
Blake, Rilke, Eckhart,
they tried to capture it.

425
00:44:35.523 --> 00:44:37.272
I'm all in.

426
00:44:37.314 --> 00:44:38.564
I want in.

427
00:44:38.606 --> 00:44:42.356
Okay. Okay, yeah.
I'll take you there.

428
00:44:42.398 --> 00:44:44.147
I've seen where it leads...

429
00:44:46.689 --> 00:44:49.231
...and, wow!

430
00:44:56.648 --> 00:44:58.064
Andra?

431
00:44:58.106 --> 00:44:59.522
Delfi.

432
00:44:59.564 --> 00:45:01.315
No time,.
Thank you for everything.

433
00:45:01.357 --> 00:45:04.357
No. Thank you. Fossmill Cabin!

434
00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:14.273
I was out of it.
I was out of my mind.

435
00:45:14.315 --> 00:45:16.565
Everything was glimmering
and joined.

436
00:45:16.607 --> 00:45:18.273
I felt so free.

437
00:45:18.315 --> 00:45:20.732
I mean, it lasted just a moment,
but it was enough.

438
00:45:20.773 --> 00:45:22.690
Listen, Andra.
I need to talk to you.

439
00:45:22.732 --> 00:45:24.398
I'm worried about you.

440
00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:26.690
Why are you worried?
No, Delfi. I'm finally awake.

441
00:45:26.732 --> 00:45:30.064
I mean, I've seen with my mind.

442
00:45:35.357 --> 00:45:37.357
So beautiful.

443
00:45:40.899 --> 00:45:42.815
Andra? No, Andra.

444
00:45:49.774 --> 00:45:51.108
Andra!

445
00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:54.316
I'm fine. No. It's nothing.

446
00:45:54.358 --> 00:45:56.358
Oh.

447
00:46:14.899 --> 00:46:17.108
Okay. We made it.

448
00:46:21.608 --> 00:46:25.399
Andra?

449
00:46:25.441 --> 00:46:27.441
We need to talk.

450
00:46:41.691 --> 00:46:43.691
I'm serious, Andra.

451
00:48:05.902 --> 00:48:07.902
You came here
looking for answers.

452
00:48:12.693 --> 00:48:16.235
She's got one, maybe two,
days left.

453
00:48:16.277 --> 00:48:17.610
What are you saying?

454
00:48:17.652 --> 00:48:19.236
It got into her.

455
00:48:19.278 --> 00:48:20.526
How?

456
00:48:20.568 --> 00:48:22.943
The same way it got into you.

457
00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:36.402
Darkness and light
are two sides of the same coin.

458
00:48:36.444 --> 00:48:38.486
Forever united.

459
00:48:38.528 --> 00:48:41.569
In some scenarios,

460
00:48:41.611 --> 00:48:46.069
they seep, one into the other.

461
00:48:46.111 --> 00:48:50.736
The light so bright
that it can burn a hole,

462
00:48:50.778 --> 00:48:52.819
as it did in Andra's soul.

463
00:48:54.736 --> 00:48:57.736
That's how it got in.

464
00:48:57.778 --> 00:48:59.903
It traps souls

465
00:48:59.945 --> 00:49:03.652
and stops them from recycling.

466
00:49:03.694 --> 00:49:08.611
But I'm here. How did I recycle?

467
00:49:08.653 --> 00:49:10.569
There's an exorcism.

468
00:49:10.611 --> 00:49:12.611
I performed it.

469
00:49:19.487 --> 00:49:21.487
Perform it on Andra, then.

470
00:49:24.362 --> 00:49:26.362
It requires a sacrifice.

471
00:49:27.570 --> 00:49:29.570
What kind of sacrifice?

472
00:49:33.029 --> 00:49:35.029
I won't let it have her.

473
00:49:36.487 --> 00:49:38.487
What kind of sacrifice?

474
00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:17.156
Shit.

475
00:52:28.824 --> 00:52:32.324
This is a dream.

476
00:52:32.365 --> 00:52:34.532
You said that before.

477
00:52:55.199 --> 00:52:57.199
Andra, wake up.

478
00:53:02.116 --> 00:53:04.116
It's almost 2:00...

479
00:53:05.784 --> 00:53:07.784
...p.m.?

480
00:53:16.825 --> 00:53:18.825
Andra?

481
00:53:24.408 --> 00:53:28.658
Something... Something's wrong...

482
00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:31.658
What?

483
00:53:48.909 --> 00:53:50.909
What?

484
00:54:33.410 --> 00:54:35.702
No, wait. No, wait.

485
00:54:35.744 --> 00:54:38.159
Delfi, we go back.

486
00:54:38.201 --> 00:54:39.409
What?

487
00:54:39.451 --> 00:54:42.910
We go back
to the place of power.

488
00:54:42.951 --> 00:54:46.869
And if I could just
go back to that light...

489
00:54:46.911 --> 00:54:51.409
If I just find that light
and I'll stay there...

490
00:54:51.451 --> 00:54:54.869
I swear. I'll stay
there forever,

491
00:54:54.911 --> 00:54:56.994
and everything will be okay.

492
00:54:57.036 --> 00:54:59.036
Okay?

493
00:55:00.952 --> 00:55:02.119
No, no, no. Please.

494
00:55:02.161 --> 00:55:03.660
It doesn't work like that,
Andra.

495
00:55:03.702 --> 00:55:04.869
It doesn't work
like that.

496
00:55:04.911 --> 00:55:07.161
Please take me back.

497
00:55:16.161 --> 00:55:18.202
Andra?

498
00:55:30.369 --> 00:55:32.452
- Get back.
- Please. You got to let me in.

499
00:55:32.494 --> 00:55:34.327
- Please. You don't understand.
- I said get back.

500
00:55:34.369 --> 00:55:35.994
Why are you sending us away?

501
00:55:36.036 --> 00:55:37.786
- Andra...
- I'm not leaving till I know.

502
00:55:37.828 --> 00:55:39.786
Something foul
was around last night.

503
00:55:39.828 --> 00:55:41.786
I didn't feel like
closing it up.

504
00:55:41.828 --> 00:55:43.452
Tonight, though,
I'm not taking any chances.

505
00:55:43.494 --> 00:55:45.120
Please. You don't understand.

506
00:55:45.161 --> 00:55:47.369
Look. You're not the only ones
I sent away.

507
00:55:47.411 --> 00:55:48.953
It's just this place
exposes people.

508
00:55:48.995 --> 00:55:50.703
Everyone inside
has got to be clean.

509
00:55:50.745 --> 00:55:52.245
Well, I'm a good person!

510
00:55:52.287 --> 00:55:54.452
Good people catch bad things
all the time.

511
00:55:54.494 --> 00:55:56.161
That's why I can't have you
here.

512
00:55:56.203 --> 00:55:58.911
Well, fuck you!
Fuck you, you fucking prick.

513
00:55:58.953 --> 00:56:00.745
You should have been here
yesterday.

514
00:56:00.787 --> 00:56:02.787
Where the hell
were you yesterday?

515
00:56:06.538 --> 00:56:07.870
Oh, fuck that place!

516
00:56:07.912 --> 00:56:10.537
Hey, hey, hey. What's going on?

517
00:56:10.579 --> 00:56:14.286
Last night, something
infected me. I don't know.

518
00:56:14.328 --> 00:56:15.496
Breathe, breathe.

519
00:56:15.538 --> 00:56:16.870
Everything you're going through,

520
00:56:16.912 --> 00:56:18.496
it's just side effects,
all right?

521
00:56:18.538 --> 00:56:21.203
There's a name for it.
It's called kundalini.

522
00:56:21.245 --> 00:56:24.078
Look at this!

523
00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:26.746
This look like fucking
kundalini bullshit to you?

524
00:56:26.788 --> 00:56:28.036
I mean, fuck.

525
00:56:28.078 --> 00:56:29.829
- You should go to a hospital.
- No.

526
00:56:29.871 --> 00:56:32.079
Come on.
We'll all go to the hospital.

527
00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:33.871
Andra, Andra.
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

528
00:56:33.913 --> 00:56:37.037
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
Andra, Andra. Hold my hand.

529
00:56:37.079 --> 00:56:39.163
I'll fucking kill you!

530
00:56:55.497 --> 00:56:58.079
We're almost there.

531
00:57:32.539 --> 00:57:34.247
Andra, it's going to be
all right.

532
00:57:34.289 --> 00:57:35.455
Shut the fuck up.

533
00:57:35.497 --> 00:57:37.580
I promise I won't let it
get to you.

534
00:57:37.622 --> 00:57:39.830
Get out of my face!

535
00:57:49.498 --> 00:57:51.498
Andra!

536
00:57:57.289 --> 00:58:00.163
- I know you're here.
- Andra!

537
00:58:00.205 --> 00:58:03.205
Come on, you fuck. Show your
fucking disgusting face!

538
00:58:04.665 --> 00:58:07.997
Andra, Andra?

539
00:58:10.915 --> 00:58:12.873
Andra, open up.

540
00:58:18.372 --> 00:58:20.414
Andra?

541
00:58:25.456 --> 00:58:27.998
Andra, no! No.

542
00:58:28.040 --> 00:58:31.040
Andra! Shit.

543
00:58:40.582 --> 00:58:42.624
She didn't mean it.

544
00:58:42.666 --> 00:58:45.873
Over here.

545
00:58:57.582 --> 00:58:59.916
It's me you're hearing.

546
00:59:01.582 --> 00:59:04.582
Come. Let's talk.

547
00:59:28.749 --> 00:59:31.583
Andra is in bad trouble.

548
00:59:31.625 --> 00:59:33.500
Everything she said is true.

549
00:59:35.333 --> 00:59:37.333
Go to her right now.

550
00:59:37.375 --> 00:59:39.040
She said she'd kill me.

551
00:59:39.082 --> 00:59:44.040
A declaration of undying love.

552
00:59:44.082 --> 00:59:46.082
I can't believe that.

553
00:59:49.124 --> 00:59:51.124
Go get her now.

554
00:59:54.124 --> 00:59:57.250
No. This is bullshit, okay?

555
00:59:57.292 --> 01:00:01.166
I've seen,
in a dream of a dream,

556
01:00:01.208 --> 01:00:02.708
you and her intertwined.

557
01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:05.458
Many hundreds of years past...

558
01:00:07.542 --> 01:00:10.208
And many more to come.

559
01:00:18.125 --> 01:00:19.667
Go to her right now.

560
01:00:45.418 --> 01:00:47.418
Andra?

561
01:01:25.294 --> 01:01:27.168
Andra?

562
01:01:30.419 --> 01:01:35.210
Flee the light.

563
01:01:35.252 --> 01:01:39.335
It hunts in the light.

564
01:01:41.377 --> 01:01:43.085
Breathe!

565
01:03:18.296 --> 01:03:20.504
Remember when we met?

566
01:03:28.837 --> 01:03:30.297
Look.

567
01:03:31.671 --> 01:03:34.587
I won't.

568
01:03:34.629 --> 01:03:36.920
Look.

569
01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:48.630
Let's start again, then.

570
01:03:55.921 --> 01:03:58.421
Fight it, Andra.
You can control it.

571
01:03:58.463 --> 01:04:00.005
Run.

572
01:04:00.047 --> 01:04:01.421
Run.

573
01:04:01.463 --> 01:04:02.713
Control it.

574
01:04:06.547 --> 01:04:08.963
Andra?

575
01:04:09.005 --> 01:04:10.505
No!

576
01:04:12.005 --> 01:04:14.463
See you soon.

577
01:05:02.673 --> 01:05:04.673
Hello?

578
01:05:09.548 --> 01:05:11.299
Is anyone in here?

579
01:05:17.132 --> 01:05:19.424
Is anyone in here?

580
01:05:30.881 --> 01:05:32.424
Andra?

581
01:05:56.133 --> 01:05:59.008
Now, come.

582
01:06:00.757 --> 01:06:02.840
Come to me.

583
01:06:14.674 --> 01:06:16.341
Whoa. No, no, no.

584
01:06:19.050 --> 01:06:21.840
Andra, I want to help you.
I need you...

585
01:06:24.133 --> 01:06:26.050
...to help me.

586
01:07:14.092 --> 01:07:15.926
I won't let it have her.

587
01:07:17.092 --> 01:07:19.426
It requires a sacrifice.

588
01:07:21.968 --> 01:07:24.801
What kind of sacrifice?

589
01:07:35.717 --> 01:07:37.717
I've got to make this right.

590
01:07:42.010 --> 01:07:44.550
Stay with her.

591
01:07:44.592 --> 01:07:46.676
Tell her I'm sorry.

592
01:08:07.718 --> 01:08:09.551
Just breathe.

593
01:08:09.593 --> 01:08:12.802
Breathe. Focus on me.
Focus on my voice. Focus on me.

594
01:08:12.844 --> 01:08:15.093
Oh, no, Delfi!

595
01:08:15.135 --> 01:08:17.761
Delfi went to get help.
She's fine.

596
01:08:17.803 --> 01:08:19.803
She's fine, okay?

597
01:08:25.136 --> 01:08:27.969
Breathe, Andra, Andra.

598
01:08:28.011 --> 01:08:30.468
Focus on my voice.
Focus on my voice.

599
01:08:38.635 --> 01:08:40.969
Andra! Stay focused
on me. Focus on my voice, okay?

600
01:08:42.677 --> 01:08:44.927
Breathe, breathe.
Andra? Andra, breathe.

601
01:08:46.178 --> 01:08:48.844
Andra, breathe. Breathe.
Come on.

602
01:08:48.886 --> 01:08:51.053
Andra, Andra!

603
01:08:59.804 --> 01:09:02.177
Breathe, Andra. Andra.

604
01:09:02.219 --> 01:09:04.720
Andra, stay focused on me.

605
01:09:16.804 --> 01:09:21.053
Come on. I'm here.

606
01:09:22.929 --> 01:09:25.012
Just breathe.
It's going to be fine.

607
01:09:32.678 --> 01:09:34.887
Come and get me.

608
01:09:36.345 --> 01:09:38.178
Fight it. Fight it!

609
01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:39.845
Fight it.

610
01:09:39.887 --> 01:09:41.679
Fight it!

611
01:10:59.306 --> 01:11:00.889
Delfi!

612
01:11:57.473 --> 01:12:00.807
No, it doesn't matter.
You're okay.

613
01:12:14.973 --> 01:12:16.390
No!

614
01:12:27.432 --> 01:12:29.348
. You're okay.

615
01:12:29.390 --> 01:12:31.849
You're okay.
I got you. I got you.

616
01:12:31.891 --> 01:12:34.516
I got you. You're okay.

617
01:12:40.515 --> 01:12:42.390
Andra.

618
01:12:42.432 --> 01:12:44.016
Oh, Delfi.

619
01:12:44.058 --> 01:12:45.224
What?

620
01:12:45.266 --> 01:12:47.266
Delfi is gone.

621
01:13:23.975 --> 01:13:26.474
You sure you don't want me
to come with you?

622
01:13:28.642 --> 01:13:30.809
I'll be fine.

623
01:13:48.601 --> 01:13:49.975
Pat?

624
01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:16.101
I just can't get these images
out of my head.

625
01:14:16.143 --> 01:14:18.976
Delfi trapped

626
01:14:19.018 --> 01:14:21.934
in that evil dimension

627
01:14:21.976 --> 01:14:23.851
with all that light
sucked out of her.

628
01:14:23.893 --> 01:14:25.893
That didn't happen to her.

629
01:14:27.685 --> 01:14:30.851
She's one of the lucky ones,
and you saved her.

630
01:14:35.185 --> 01:14:38.268
No. She gave her life
to save me.

631
01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:40.101
She gave her life, yes.

632
01:14:40.143 --> 01:14:43.934
But she saved her soul, which is
what the darkness wanted.

633
01:14:43.976 --> 01:14:46.519
Her beautiful, mischievous soul.

634
01:14:46.561 --> 01:14:48.519
However, thanks to you,

635
01:14:48.561 --> 01:14:51.561
it now has a new interest.

636
01:14:57.477 --> 01:15:00.519
That burden you mentioned
when we first talked?

637
01:15:00.561 --> 01:15:02.644
It fixates on the last soul
to escape it,

638
01:15:02.686 --> 01:15:05.061
as it did with Delfi
and those before her.

639
01:15:10.561 --> 01:15:13.644
How long has this cycle
been going on?

640
01:15:13.686 --> 01:15:15.644
Since there's been light,

641
01:15:15.686 --> 01:15:17.894
there's been darkness.

642
01:15:22.269 --> 01:15:26.019
And now, I'm its latest target?

643
01:15:26.061 --> 01:15:28.561
Yes.

644
01:15:28.603 --> 01:15:30.269
However, it's not all hopeless.

645
01:15:30.311 --> 01:15:32.227
I can teach you ways
to be vigilant

646
01:15:32.269 --> 01:15:34.269
and to protect yourself.

647
01:15:36.186 --> 01:15:40.144
It'll be hard, but you must find
the balance.

648
01:15:40.186 --> 01:15:42.603
Elude the darkness,

649
01:15:42.645 --> 01:15:46.020
but keep it close enough
that it can't hunt others.

650
01:15:46.061 --> 01:15:50.062
That's the trick.

651
01:15:54.478 --> 01:15:56.145
It's a hell of a burden.

652
01:15:56.187 --> 01:15:58.145
But a noble one.

653
01:15:58.187 --> 01:16:01.270
You're quite strong, Andra.

654
01:16:01.312 --> 01:16:03.436
It's very possible
that you could survive

655
01:16:03.478 --> 01:16:05.478
with the darkness...

656
01:16:07.062 --> 01:16:09.396
...forever.

657
01:16:13.228 --> 01:16:15.228
Forever?

658
