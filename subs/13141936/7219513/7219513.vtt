by anything in particular?

backpacking across Canada.

548
00:41:46.144 --> 00:41:48.268
And then, these guys
at the hostel in Toronto

549
00:41:48.310 --> 00:41:50.227
were, like,
"Come check this place out."

550
00:41:50.269 --> 00:41:52.185
And I was, like,
"Yeah, sure. Why not?"

551
00:41:52.227 --> 00:41:56.102
So, I've been here every night
for, like, a week now.

552
00:41:56.144 --> 00:41:57.977
We just arrived yesterday.

553
00:41:58.019 --> 00:41:59.935
Oh. Well, are you staying
in town, or...

554
00:41:59.977 --> 00:42:04.143
A bit out, actually.
Um, it's a really pretty...

555
00:42:04.185 --> 00:42:05.644
You should come check it out.

I feel like I know you.

559
00:42:11.353 --> 00:42:12.686
Right. Like you do.

560
00:42:12.728 --> 00:42:14.227
Yeah.

561
00:42:14.269 --> 00:42:16.185
Right. See what I mean?
Like, you're just...

562
00:42:16.227 --> 00:42:17.436
- Familiar.
- Yeah.

563
00:42:17.478 --> 00:42:19.103
You're just different.

564
00:42:19.144 --> 00:42:21.436
You probably get that
all the time, though.

Shut the fuck up.

728
00:57:35.497 --> 00:57:37.580
I promise I won't let it
get to you.

729
00:57:37.622 --> 00:57:39.830
Get out of my face!

730
00:57:46.498 --> 00:57:48.498
(door slamming, lock clicking)

731
00:57:49.498 --> 00:57:51.498
Delfi:
Andra!

732
00:57:57.289 --> 00:58:00.163
- I know you're here.
- Andra!

733
00:58:00.205 --> 00:58:03.205
Come on, you fuck. Show your
fucking disgusting face!

734
00:58:04.665 --> 00:58:07.997
Andra, Andra?

735
00:58:10.915 --> 00:58:12.873
Andra, open up.

736
00:58:18.372 --> 00:58:20.414
Andra?

737
00:58:20.456 --> 00:58:22.456
(skin cracking)

738
00:58:25.456 --> 00:58:27.998
Andra, no! No.

739
00:58:28.040 --> 00:58:31.040
Andra! Shit.

740
00:58:40.582 --> 00:58:42.624
Kata:
She didn't mean it.

741
00:58:42.666 --> 00:58:45.873
Over here.

742
00:58:57.582 --> 00:58:59.916
It's me you're hearing.

743
00:59:01.582 --> 00:59:04.582
Come. Let's talk.

744
00:59:28.749 --> 00:59:31.583
Andra is in bad trouble.

745
00:59:31.625 --> 00:59:33.500
Everything she said is true.

746
00:59:35.333 --> 00:59:37.333
Go to her right now.

747
00:59:37.375 --> 00:59:39.040
She said she'd kill me.

748
00:59:39.082 --> 00:59:44.040
Kata:
A declaration of undying love.

749
00:59:44.082 --> 00:59:46.082
Sid:
I can't believe that.

750
00:59:49.124 --> 00:59:51.124
Kata:
Go get her now.

751
00:59:54.124 --> 00:59:57.250
No. This is bullshit, okay?

752
00:59:57.292 --> 01:00:01.166
I've seen,
in a dream of a dream,

753
01:00:01.208 --> 01:00:02.708
you and her intertwined.

754
01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:05.458
Many hundreds of years past...

755
01:00:07.542 --> 01:00:10.208
And many more to come.

756
01:00:18.125 --> 01:00:19.667
Go to her right now.

758
01:00:45.418 --> 01:00:47.418
Andra?

760
01:01:25.294 --> 01:01:27.168
Andra?

(choking)

762
01:01:30.419 --> 01:01:35.210
Flee the light.

763
01:01:35.252 --> 01:01:39.335
It hunts in the light.

764
01:01:41.377 --> 01:01:43.085

Demon:
Remember when we met?

Look.

770
01:03:31.671 --> 01:03:34.587
I won't.

771
01:03:34.629 --> 01:03:36.920
Look.

772
01:03:36.962 --> 01:03:40.213
(whimpering)

773
01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:48.630

Fight it, Andra.
You can control it.

Demon: Run.

778
01:04:00.047 --> 01:04:01.421

Run.

779
01:04:01.463 --> 01:04:02.713
Control it.

Andra?

781

What kind of sacrifice?

811

Andra:
Oh, Delfi.

860
01:12:44.058 --> 01:12:45.224
What?

861
01:12:45.266 --> 01:12:47.266
Delfi is gone.

862
01:12:53.016 --> 01:12:54.433
(loon crying)

863
01:13:23.975 --> 01:13:26.474

to come with you?

01:13:28.642 --> 01:13:30.809
Andra:
I'll be fine.

865
01:13:48.601 --> 01:13:49.975
Pat?

866
01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:16.101
I just can't get these images
out of my head.

867
01:14:16.143 --> 01:14:18.976
Delfi trapped

868
01:14:19.018 --> 01:14:21.934
in that evil dimension

869
01:14:21.976 --> 01:14:23.851
with all that light
sucked out of her.

870
01:14:23.893 --> 01:14:25.893
That didn't happen to her.

871
01:14:27.685 --> 01:14:30.851
She's one of the lucky ones,
and you saved her.

872
01:14:35.185 --> 01:14:38.268
No. She gave her life
to save me.

873
01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:40.101
She gave her life, yes.

874
01:14:40.143 --> 01:14:43.934
But she saved her soul, which is
what the darkness wanted.

875
01:14:43.976 --> 01:14:46.519
Her beautiful, mischievous soul.

876
01:14:46.561 --> 01:14:48.519
However, thanks to you,

877
01:14:48.561 --> 01:14:51.561
it now has a new interest.

878
01:14:57.477 --> 01:15:00.519
That burden you mentioned
when we first talked?

879
01:15:00.561 --> 01:15:02.644
It fixates on the last soul
to escape it,

880
01:15:02.686 --> 01:15:05.061
as it did with Delfi
and those before her.

881
01:15:10.561 --> 01:15:13.644
How long has this cycle
been going on?

882
01:15:13.686 --> 01:15:15.644
Since there's been light,

883
01:15:15.686 --> 01:15:17.894
there's been darkness.

884
01:15:22.269 --> 01:15:26.019
And now, I'm its latest target?

885
01:15:26.061 --> 01:15:28.561
Yes.

886
01:15:28.603 --> 01:15:30.269
However, it's not all hopeless.

887
01:15:30.311 --> 01:15:32.227
I can teach you ways
to be vigilant

888
01:15:32.269 --> 01:15:34.269
and to protect yourself.

889
01:15:36.186 --> 01:15:40.144
It'll be hard, but you must find
the balance.

890
01:15:40.186 --> 01:15:42.603
Elude the darkness,

891
01:15:42.645 --> 01:15:46.020
but keep it close enough
that it can't hunt others.

892
01:15:46.061 --> 01:15:50.062
That's the trick.

893
01:15:54.478 --> 01:15:56.145
It's a hell of a burden.

894
01:15:56.187 --> 01:15:58.145
Pat:
But a noble one.

895
01:15:58.187 --> 01:16:01.270
You're quite strong, Andra.

896
01:16:01.312 --> 01:16:03.436
It's very possible
that you could survive

897
01:16:03.478 --> 01:16:05.478
with the darkness...

898
01:16:07.062 --> 01:16:09.396
...forever.

899
01:16:13.228 --> 01:16:15.228
Forever?
