00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.080
Hey! Here again?

2
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.960
- Is he here yet?
- No.

3
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.090
- I think you scared him.
- I've got to take a massive piss.

4
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.010
Dude, any excuse for you
to pull that thing out.

5
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.930
Hey...

6
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.190
Anyone got any beer?

7
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.850
We finished them all back
at school.

8
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.770
Besides, you've had enough.

9
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.950
I've got one.

10
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.750
It's not cold,
but it's yours if you want it.

11
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.740
All you've got to do
is sit up, beg,

12
00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.820
roll over,
and shake that booty.

13
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.540
Thanks a lot, Eric.

14
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.090
Anytime, anywhere.

15
00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.410
This is going to be sweet.

16
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.410
I'm glad I thought of it.

17
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.000
You guys are animals.
Just 'cause he's new.

18
00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.080
You've been talking shit
the whole time here.

19
00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.350
Why don't you be quiet?

20
00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.890
- You know how it is.
- What is the matter with you?

21
00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.310
Nobody's forcing him to show up.

22
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.670
Dean! Yeah!

23
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.260
What if he doesn't?
I want to go back to the dance.

24
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.140
Belinda, I've got an idea.

25
00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.270
Why don't you go back
to the dance by yourself?

26
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.860
I wasn't talking to you, Dean.

27
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.570
You know I don't dance.

28
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.620
It's true. I've seen the man
bust a move and it just ain't pretty.

29
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.540
But a brother like me is ready
to get his freak on,

30
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.950
so what do you say, baby?

31
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.360
Put your freak away
before you hurt somebody.

32
00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.130
- He's here, he's here!
- Here he comes, here he comes.

33
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.330
He's... here.

34
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.250
Hey, check out
the Safari Joe truck.

35
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.470
I can't wait to see you fly!

36
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.930
Hi.

37
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.880
- Hey.
- Nice shirt, Opie.

38
00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.140
You're late.

39
00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.390
I thought...

40
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.140
I thought I said be here at ten.

41
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.030
When I say be here at ten,
you be here, okay?

42
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.610
Can remember that next time?

43
00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.580
If there is a next time!

44
00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.990
- Is he always like that?
- Always, man.

45
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.500
So how 'bout it?

46
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.370
Ready to fly?

47
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:22.660
Wait up, baby!

48
00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.010
Let me get on your back!
Pick me up, pick me up!

49
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.570
Here's the deal.

50
00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.280
You're going to jump
from up there into here.

51
00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.280
That's it, and you're one of us.

52
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:03.750
- You ready?
- Yeah.

53
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.250
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

54
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:07.330
All right.

55
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.790
Let's do this, okay?

56
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.420
It's cake, I'm jumping with you.

57
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.010
How deep is this?

58
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.630
I don't really know.

59
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.640
Let's go find out.

60
00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:29.980
Let's do it.

61
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.510
Yeah! Shit, yeah!

62
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.960
Come on, let's go!

63
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.470
- You done this?
- We've all done this.

64
00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.060
Hope you had your Wheaties!

65
00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.520
You guys going to do
this sometime tonight?

66
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:19.930
On three.

67
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.100
One...

68
00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.900
two...

69
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.780
three!

70
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.380
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, shit.

71
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:46.630
He's hurt!

72
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.960
- Landon, he's hurt!
- Is he okay?

73
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.000
Landon, get down here!

74
00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.300
What the hell?

75
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:52.930
What the hell?

76
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.210
You guys, he's hurt!

77
00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:55.480
Come on, man!

78
00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.690
Dean, you idiot,
I told you it was a bad idea!

79
00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:59.350
Landon,
get him out of the water!

80
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.600
Hurry up!

81
00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.230
Is he dead?
What're we going to do?

82
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.650
Help me!

83
00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:10.850
Get him over here!

84
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.330
There's a pipe in here!
He must have hit it!

85
00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.700
- Get him out of the water!
- Get over here!

86
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.250
Watch his head!

87
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.880
- Get him out.
- Who's down there?

88
00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.500
- Come on!
- Tracie, come on!

89
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:26.540
Come on!

90
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:27.990
Go!

91
00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.620
Central, we've got some trespassers.
Better get a squad car out here.

92
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.920
Come on, Landon!

93
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:35.720
Come on!

94
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:40.510
- You guys, just take him!
- Give me his arms!

95
00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.380
I got him.

96
00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.600
We got to get out of here!

97
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:52.650
Go! Get of out of here!

98
00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:58.030
I told you not to do this!

99
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.070
Calm down.

100
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.160
Belinda, let's go!

101
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.040
Come on, get in! I'm driving!

102
00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:12.790
Oh, shit.

103
00:07:58.380 --> 00:07:59.210
Shit!

104
00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.160
Put your hands on the wheel.

105
00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:00.920
Mama,

106
00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:04.190
my leg really hurts today.
I don't think I can go anyplace.

107
00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:08.270
Maybe I should call your father.

108
00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:09.970
No.

109
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:12.990
I'm not talking to him.
There's no way.

110
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.070
This has got to stop
between you an him.

111
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.370
You can't do that.
You need a father.

112
00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:22.690
Let us be thankful today

113
00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.530
that a young life
was saved by our lord.

114
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:29.670
And let us pray for the lives
of the others involved,

115
00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:32.410
who are clearly not
on the path of righteousness.

116
00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:50.810
Let the light

117
00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:53.760
from the lighthouse,

118
00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:56.610
let it shine on me

119
00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.160
I wonder if the light

120
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:05.740
from the lighthouse

121
00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:14.460
would shine on me.

122
00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:19.950
Here is my thought,

123
00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.410
this is my plea

124
00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:27.500
Lord let your holy light
shine on me

125
00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:32.310
I wonder will you hear
my prayer

126
00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.850
I know I'm not worthy

127
00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:37.230
but I need your help

128
00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.360
Lord shine your light

129
00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:41.730
shine it this way

130
00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:46.140
Shine it so I can see
which way to take

131
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:48.990
My faith is in you

132
00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:51.980
to bring me through

133
00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.000
I have one question

134
00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.850
- How's the leg?
- It's good.

135
00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:18.760
I can't believe you were in jail.

136
00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:20.310
What did you tell them?

137
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.890
I said it was a nice night
for a drive.

138
00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:26.150
Ended up hanging out at
the cement factory, found Gephardt.

139
00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.020
Tried to give him help,
got spooked.

140
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:30.140
Figured I ought to leave

141
00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.360
before they thought
I had anything to do with it.

142
00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:34.820
Got to hand it to you, man.
You're a Jedi Master of bullshit.

143
00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.950
Damn, that Jamie Sullivan
sure has style.

144
00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:43.000
Wore that dress
in the fourth grade.

145
00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.210
It's the quiet ones
you got to watch out for.

146
00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:48.410
I mean, hey, man, she might put it
on a brother like a Pop-Tart.

147
00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:51.330
A little maintenance,
she might not look too bad.

148
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:53.550
Nice sweater.

149
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:55.580
Thank you.

150
00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:05.230
Thank you.

151
00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:22.730
Student claims you were drinking
on school property Saturday night.

152
00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:25.200
Lucky for you,
Clay Gephardt isn't talking.

153
00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:28.410
The owners of the factory
aren't pressing charges.

154
00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.110
At least not today.

155
00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.040
I said I'd arrange
appropriate punishment.

156
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.800
Are you going to expel me?

157
00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:37.800
Not yet.

158
00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:41.580
Besides attending your classes,

159
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:44.460
you will help ourjanitorial staff
after school.

160
00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.800
For pay?

161
00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:48.100
For the inner satisfaction
it brings.

162
00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:52.190
On Saturdays you'll tutor disadvantaged
students at our sister school.

163
00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:56.230
Finally, you'll participate
in the drama club's final event.

164
00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.470
The spring play?

165
00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:02.860
It's time for you
to experience other things,

166
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:05.440
started spending time
with other kinds of people.

167
00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:08.700
Don't blow it, Landon.

168
00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:18.080
This is a simple device
made of plastic wrap,

169
00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:20.160
a coat hanger and White-Out.

170
00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:23.500
- Does anyone know what it is?
- It's a star frame.

171
00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:29.510
This is a star frame

172
00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:33.040
and it will help you locate stars
with your naked eye.

173
00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:34.960
Mercury and Jupiter
can be seen

174
00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:38.760
over the west-southwestern horizon,
after sunset.

175
00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:42.150
Bet you can see angels
up there flying around.

176
00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:45.890
In fact, there are some things
that could be called miraculous.

177
00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:48.490
Einstein said the more
he studied the universe,

178
00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:50.730
the more he believed
in a higher power.

179
00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.160
If there is a higher power,

180
00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:56.740
then why is it he can't get you
a new sweater?

181
00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.620
He's too busy looking for
your brain.

182
00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:05.630
- Laugh, it's a joke.
- Let's get out of here.

183
00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:06.960
I got to stay.

184
00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:09.670
Principal's gone.
Let's make some moves.

185
00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:12.630
Come on, come on.

186
00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:13.760
Come on.

187
00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:17.050
Custodian thing suits you.
It works.

188
00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:18.850
Thanks, brother.

189
00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:27.560
If you look at the chart I gave you,
you'll see how this comet...

190
00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:33.320
Okay, so I'll see you at school.

191
00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:36.690
My parents aren't home
if you want to come inside.

192
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:41.020
Belinda, nothing's changed.

193
00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:43.110
I know.

194
00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:44.910
I just thought--

195
00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:46.500
It's over.

196
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:48.860
Yeah,

197
00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:50.360
whatever.

198
00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:09.810
Good morning, Landon.

199
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.880
Landon, wake up!

200
00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.260
Come on. Up, up, up, up!

201
00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:18.260
Up!

202
00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:20.860
It's Saturday, no school.

203
00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:23.820
Tutoring.

204
00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:44.220
Let's try this again.

205
00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:48.260
Which of these are similar triangles?
This on or that one?

206
00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:53.130
- What do you think?
- I think this is bullshit!

207
00:15:57.940 --> 00:15:59.190
Makes two of us.

208
00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:22.460
Hey!

209
00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:25.700
Want to buy some raffle tickets?

210
00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:30.050
I'm trying to raise enough money
to buy Jefferson some new computers.

211
00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:31.210
No.

212
00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:37.300
I saw you in there with Luis.

213
00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:41.140
I know it can be difficult...

214
00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:43.470
but maybe you should try backing
into it from somewhere else.

215
00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.720
Are you going to go
visit Clay Gephardt?

216
00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:57.160
That would be a no.

217
00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:02.790
They moved him from the hospital
to that rehab place on Oak Street.

218
00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.540
Is this your idea of
small talk or something?

219
00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:09.820
If it is, your social skills need
some work. No one forced him to jump.

220
00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:11.240
It's called peer pressure.

221
00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:14.790
How do you know about that?
Read it in your precious book?

222
00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:22.420
Please don't pretend you know me.

223
00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:24.760
But I do,

224
00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:26.310
I do.

225
00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:29.560
We have all the same classes,
in the same school, since kindergarten.

226
00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:31.900
Why, you're Jamie Sullivan.

227
00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:34.310
You sit at lunch table seven,

228
00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:38.320
not exactly the reject table but
definitely in self-exile territory.

229
00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.700
You have exactly one sweater.

230
00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:42.910
You like to look at your feet
when you walk.

231
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:47.160
For fun you like to
tutor on weekends

232
00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:49.570
and hang out with the cool kids
from Stars and Planets.

233
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:50.860
How's that sound?

234
00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:53.670
Fairly predictable.

235
00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.910
Nothing I haven't heard before.

236
00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:59.280
You don't care what people think?

237
00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:00.670
No.

238
00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:31.690
I don't know
what your problem is.

239
00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:34.360
Miss Garber has
some nice hooters.

240
00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:36.540
This is bullshit.

241
00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:37.940
Thanks.

242
00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:41.870
I can't wait to see you
in make-up. That'll be cool.

243
00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:44.210
Be back in an hour.
Don't flake.

244
00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:46.450
Tell them to do
''West Side Story.''

245
00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:49.800
Get that nice big-booty girl
from ''Selena.''

246
00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:52.720
Maria, Maria!

247
00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:56.380
This year's spring musical
is about burning passion

248
00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:57.640
and blazing Tommy guns.

249
00:18:58.310 --> 00:19:00.770
Written by our
own Eddie Zimmerhoff.

250
00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:03.650
With words and music
by Jamie Sullivan.

251
00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:07.430
It follows the rise and fall
of Tommy the Gun Thornton

252
00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:10.320
in Prohibition-era New York.
Eddie, perhaps...

253
00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:11.810
Mr. Carter,

254
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:14.700
better late than never.
Please join us.

255
00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:15.860
Sure.

256
00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:21.240
Now then, let's see...

257
00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:26.120
Jamie will be our Alicia,
a mysterious club singer.

258
00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.370
Sally will be playing Caroline.

259
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.030
Congratulations.

260
00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:33.800
And Landon will read
Tommy Thornton.

261
00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:35.380
What?

262
00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:37.050
No.

263
00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:40.710
No. See, I didn't plan
on acting or anything.

264
00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:42.890
When did you know, Tommy?

265
00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:47.310
- Know what?
- That we were in love.

266
00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:51.140
Love?

267
00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:54.820
Baby,

268
00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:58.350
believe me, you don't want to
go falling in love with a guy like me.

269
00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:01.200
It's too late, Tommy.
I'm crazy about you.

270
00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:03.770
I'm breathing it,
drinking it all in,

271
00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:05.360
aren't you?

272
00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:10.330
I don't know
what I'm drinking,

273
00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:13.000
dollface,
but if this is love...

274
00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:15.070
pour me another glass?

275
00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:18.800
Mr. Carter,
are you trying to be bad at this?

276
00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:21.250
No, just comes naturally.

277
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:26.050
All right, everybody,
let's go to the end.

278
00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:34.730
Don't even pretend like
you're not going to be great.

279
00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:37.860
- Okay. See you tomorrow.
- See you.

280
00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:43.230
- Hi.
- Hi.

281
00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:52.240
Would it kill you to try?

282
00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:54.870
Yes, and I'm too young to die.

283
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.400
You don't care about classes
or graduating, but you like school...

284
00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:02.090
because you're popular
and you'll never be on top again.

285
00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:04.710
That's thoroughly predictable.

286
00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:07.620
Your act only works on an audience.

287
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:42.150
Feeling Christian?

288
00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:43.620
Seat belt?

289
00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:07.680
- I forfeit.
- Thank you.

290
00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:09.640
Forty-two.

291
00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:13.390
What do you mean, forty-two?

292
00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:15.940
Forty-two is befriend
somebody I don't like.

293
00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:21.990
It's a to-do list for my life.

294
00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:24.070
What, like
getting a new personality?

295
00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.900
Join the Peace Corps,

296
00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:28.490
- make a medical discovery...
- That's ambitious.

297
00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:31.540
be in two places at once,
get a tattoo.

298
00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:35.500
What's number one?

299
00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:38.880
I'd tell you...

300
00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:41.260
but then I'd have to kill you.

301
00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:00.980
- I've come to see if you're ready.
- Take a good look, lady,

302
00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:03.860
because the only thing
I'm ready for is a dirt nap.

303
00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:06.820
Ready to look inside
your heart, Tom Thornton.

304
00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:10.080
You words have been heard,
and not just by me.

305
00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:13.200
When you walked into...

306
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.450
Shit. When you walked out of the rain
and into my club,

307
00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:21.130
that wasn't just a coincidence.

308
00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:23.340
Nothing's coincidence, baby.

309
00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:27.010
You know you're the only one
who can make me sing.

310
00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:30.760
Oh, yeah, Miss Garber! You're gonna
put Eric in all your plays!

311
00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:33.600
- Eric, I'll put you in all my plays!
- Come on, man!

312
00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:34.930
Come on.

313
00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:37.800
I got three weeks to memorize this!

314
00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:40.380
You couldn't pull this off
in three months!

315
00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:42.520
DeNiro couldn't make this work!

316
00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:44.480
- Look, I didn't write it, okay?
- No, but

317
00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:47.060
you'll make a jackass of yourself

318
00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:50.070
in front of the town,
the school, your friends--

319
00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.700
I don't have a choice,
so would you help me out, please?

320
00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.900
You know
I'm busting on you, right?

321
00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:01.540
I'll be there opening night,
front row,

322
00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:03.040
and you can count on it.

323
00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:05.070
With tomatoes.

324
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:07.530
Thanks, man.

325
00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:09.080
Landon...

326
00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.220
Boys, can you help
with these groceries?

327
00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:13.920
- Yeah.
- No problem.

328
00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:24.050
Jamie.

329
00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.940
What do you want, Carter?
I've known you for years.

330
00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:31.650
You're never the first one
to come up and say hello.

331
00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:35.530
I need help with my lines.

332
00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:40.310
Landon Carter's asking me
for help?

333
00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:41.410
Yeah.

334
00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:44.190
Okay, I'll pray for you.

335
00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:47.650
Jamie. No, look...

336
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:50.790
You've obviously never asked
anyone for help before, right?

337
00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:54.460
A request like yours requires

338
00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:57.410
flattery and groveling.

339
00:24:57.670 --> 00:24:59.170
It can't be all about you.

340
00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:00.970
It has to be for the common good
of everyone.

341
00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:04.500
It is for the common good.
Eddie Zimmerhoff deserves the best.

342
00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:07.720
Please?

343
00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:10.640
Okay. One condition, though.

344
00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:11.840
What's that?

345
00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:15.650
You have to promise
you won't fall in love with me.

346
00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:21.780
- That's not a problem.
- Okay.

347
00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:23.850
I'll see you after school.

348
00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:25.480
Okay.

349
00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:29.580
Landon Carter

350
00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:30.940
is coming here?

351
00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:34.710
Boy's dangerous, he's careless.
He's the worst kind of bully.

352
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:36.750
Daddy, what about forgiveness?

353
00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:40.120
I thought we had discussed

354
00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:43.170
that I was going to decide
how I wanted to spend my time

355
00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:44.620
and my life.

356
00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:46.720
It's him I don't trust,
not you.

357
00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:57.720
Hey.

358
00:25:57.940 --> 00:25:58.800
Hi.

359
00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:03.350
You going to keep me out here
all afternoon or what?

360
00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:04.890
Come on in.

361
00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:12.870
My script is in my room,
so I'll be right down.

362
00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:15.910
- Make yourself at home.
- Yeah.

363
00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:18.780
It's not likely.

364
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:40.300
That is one scary old...

365
00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:43.140
- Jesus!
- No, Jamie's father.

366
00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:45.480
Hello, Mr. Carter.

367
00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:49.060
I understand you won the lead
in the school play. Congratulations.

368
00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:53.530
Thanks for letting me run come over
and run lines with Jamie.

369
00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:54.640
I didn't let you.

370
00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:58.070
It's a school night.

371
00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:00.610
Let's got one thing
straight, Mr. Carter.

372
00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:04.250
You think that on Sundays

373
00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:06.240
I don't see you
from where I stand.

374
00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:09.990
But I see you.

375
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:15.800
I'll be in my office,
just here.

376
00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:17.910
Ready?

377
00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:20.870
Yeah, let's go.

378
00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:29.670
Landon! Where've you been?

379
00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:31.020
Nowhere.

380
00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:33.430
- Come here.
- What's up?

381
00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:36.430
- Are we cool?
- Yeah, sure.

382
00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:57.870
What the hell?

383
00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:14.770
What are you doing here?

384
00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:16.890
I should ask you
the same question.

385
00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:19.860
Do you normally walk alone
in the cemetery at night?

386
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:22.060
Maybe.

387
00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:23.780
Where you going?

388
00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.350
Come and see.

389
00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:34.870
Okay.

390
00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:36.620
What is that?

391
00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:41.030
This is my telescope.
I built it when I was twelve.

392
00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:43.960
Take a look.

393
00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:50.670
Saturn.

394
00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.750
- Very cool.
- Yeah.

395
00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:58.470
I'm planning on building a larger one
so I can see the Comet Hyakutake.

396
00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:01.800
It comes this spring, but nobody
knows when it's coming back.

397
00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:03.560
Ah, nature's miracles.

398
00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:06.400
I get it.

399
00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:07.680
Get what?

400
00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:09.600
That you're into all this stuff.

401
00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:12.820
This stuff?

402
00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:15.160
I have my beliefs.

403
00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:16.690
I have faith,

404
00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:17.780
but don't you?

405
00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:18.810
No,

406
00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:21.620
there's too much bad shit
in this world.

407
00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:23.690
Without suffering
there'd be no compassion.

408
00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:26.070
Tell that to those who suffer.

409
00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:32.240
This is what I love
about early spring.

410
00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:34.800
Where've those legs
been hiding all winter?

411
00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.000
She's trashy.

412
00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:39.840
- Well, if it isn't the Virgin Mary.
- Dude, here comes your leading lady.

413
00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:41.890
Hey, Carter.

414
00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:43.750
So I'll see you after school?

415
00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:47.890
In your dreams.

416
00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:00.900
Hi! Where's your sweater?

417
00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:09.910
Let's get out of here.

418
00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:42.430
Come on, Jamie.

419
00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:45.150
Open the door, please!

420
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:49.070
What do you want?

421
00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:51.700
You're not in a good mood.

422
00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:53.910
You don't miss a thing.

423
00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:56.940
I was hoping
we could run lines together.

424
00:30:58.410 --> 00:31:01.420
Okay, but just
not so anyone knows, right?

425
00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:05.000
I just figured we could surprise
everyone with how good I get.

426
00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:08.340
We could be secret friends.

427
00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:09.830
Exactly!

428
00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:12.250
It's like you're reading
my mind!

429
00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:14.710
Great.
Maybe you could read mine?

430
00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:21.680
Jamie,

431
00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:23.350
- I can't just be your friend.
- Landon,

432
00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:26.110
look, I thought
I saw something in you.

433
00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:28.570
Something good.

434
00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:30.430
But I was very wrong.

435
00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:38.980
Damn it!

436
00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:46.160
Sorry.

437
00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:09.770
Jamie Sullivan Red Cross.
Stars and Planets.

438
00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:12.430
Drama Club. Ambition:
To witness a miracle.

439
00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:25.240
You know the answer?

440
00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:28.790
Look, I know you know.

441
00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:40.500
Okay, it's you, me,
and the basket.

442
00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:43.370
We form the three corners
of a triangle.

443
00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:45.430
Take a step towards the basket.

444
00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:51.560
Now am I at the same angle to you
and the basket as before?

445
00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:54.270
- Yeah.
- Are you?

446
00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:55.470
Yeah.

447
00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:57.650
So what did we just make?

448
00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:02.230
A similar triangle?

449
00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:03.850
Yes!

450
00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:05.860
Okay, make me an isosceles.

451
00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:09.900
You got it, two sides the same.

452
00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.540
Enough of this, let's play.

453
00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:26.490
I came to say I'm sorry.

454
00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:31.200
Well, you did.

455
00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:33.240
Feel better?

456
00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:36.000
No. I feel like shit.

457
00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:37.570
You know what?

458
00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:40.250
I actually thought
I wanted to be your friend.

459
00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:46.330
And now I have no idea why.

460
00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:47.840
No idea.

461
00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:53.600
I made that jump once.

462
00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:55.880
I thought I was a badass.

463
00:35:57.850 --> 00:36:01.940
I remember actually saying
that I meant to belly-flop.

464
00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:06.860
Did it hurt?

465
00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:11.020
Like hell.

466
00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:13.950
Good.

467
00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:24.880
So I guess I'll see you
at school then.

468
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:33.470
- Pour me a drink, Joey.
- You promised me, Tommy.

469
00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:36.300
No more
of your no-goodnik schemes!

470
00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:39.420
You promised me we'd go to Paris.

471
00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.020
I'm not going to
sit on my keister

472
00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:44.140
and watch all the fat cats
get rich. Trust me.

473
00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:46.060
This is a sure thing.

474
00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:47.430
That's it!

475
00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:49.550
We are through!

476
00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:52.780
Go ahead and run your booze,
you big dope!

477
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:54.530
And I hope you drown in it!

478
00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:56.700
So!

479
00:36:57.610 --> 00:36:59.490
You must be
the new girl he's hired.

480
00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:01.200
The singer?

481
00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:04.940
You want some free advice
about this one?

482
00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:08.160
Stay far away.
He's nothing but

483
00:37:08.330 --> 00:37:10.160
trouble in cheap spats.

484
00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:15.460
Look, I ain't blaming you.

485
00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:19.120
I ain't asking
for forgiveness, either.

486
00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:22.630
ljust did what I had to.

487
00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:30.060
When you walked out

488
00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:33.390
of the rain
and into my club,

489
00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:36.930
that wasn't just
a coincidence, was it?

490
00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:38.690
Nothing's coincidence.

491
00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:40.890
Your face...

492
00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:44.320
You look so familiar.

493
00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:47.120
Like this dame I knew once,

494
00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:49.200
only it wasn't real,
it was a dream.

495
00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:51.650
Tell me about this dream girl.

496
00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:58.090
Well, I don't...

497
00:37:58.840 --> 00:37:59.920
remember.

498
00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:05.970
All I know...

499
00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:12.010
is you're beautiful.

500
00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:24.190
The song, the song!

501
00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:25.930
The dream.

502
00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:29.270
Help me to remember.

503
00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:33.270
Will you sing for me?

504
00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:42.790
There's a song that's inside

505
00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:45.330
of my soul

506
00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:52.930
It's the one
that I've tried to write

507
00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:56.140
over and over again

508
00:38:57.510 --> 00:39:02.340
I will wake in the infinite cold

509
00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:09.520
But you sing to me over

510
00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:13.490
and over and over again

511
00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:16.740
So I lay

512
00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:21.030
my head back down

513
00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:27.250
And I lift my hands

514
00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:29.910
and pray

515
00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:32.630
to be only yours

516
00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:36.720
I pray to be only yours

517
00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.620
I know now

518
00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:43.600
you're my only hope.

519
00:39:50.730 --> 00:39:54.150
Sing to me the song

520
00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:57.400
of the stars

521
00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:03.320
of your galaxy dancing

522
00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:07.490
and laughing and laughing again

523
00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:12.540
When it feels like my dreams

524
00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:15.460
are so far

525
00:40:18.090 --> 00:40:21.340
sing to me of the plans

526
00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:25.260
that you have for me over again

527
00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:27.680
So I lay

528
00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:32.390
my head back down

529
00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:38.810
and I lift my hands

530
00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:41.390
and pray

531
00:40:41.650 --> 00:40:44.190
to be only yours

532
00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:50.230
I know now

533
00:40:50.410 --> 00:40:55.750
you're my only hope

534
00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:01.950
I give you my destiny

535
00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:07.590
I'm giving you all of me

536
00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:10.930
I want your symphony

537
00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:14.920
Singing in all that I am

538
00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:19.220
At the top of my lungs

539
00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:23.850
I'm giving him all I have

540
00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:27.930
So I lay

541
00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:32.600
my head back down

542
00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:37.990
and I lift my hands

543
00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:40.790
and pray

544
00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:43.250
to be only yours

545
00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:47.670
I pray to be only yours

546
00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:53.630
I know now

547
00:41:54.130 --> 00:41:59.290
you're my only hope

548
00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:33.030
Bravo!

549
00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:40.970
That was great.

550
00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:47.760
- Hi, kids.
- Hi.

551
00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:51.560
Honey, I couldn't believe it.
What a transformation.

552
00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:54.140
- Great, honey.
- Thank you, but please stop.

553
00:42:54.310 --> 00:42:56.770
- Don't be home too late.
- Okay. Thank you.

554
00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:58.400
Okay, okay.

555
00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:03.650
- Interesting rewrite you did out there.
- I did my best.

556
00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:05.820
Your acting didn't suck either.

557
00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:08.980
- Got to go. Take it easy, man.
- Okay.

558
00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:11.610
Landon, you were marvelous!

559
00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:12.940
Thank you.

560
00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:18.570
Landon?

561
00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:20.530
Fine performance.

562
00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:22.420
- What're you doing here?
- I thought

563
00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:24.660
we'd get a bite.

564
00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:25.700
I'm not hungry.

565
00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:28.470
- Landon, don't walk away.
- You taught me how.

566
00:43:37.810 --> 00:43:39.090
Oh, my God.

567
00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:41.850
Look who's here.

568
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:48.780
Don't look at him.

569
00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:50.650
You don't want to stare too much.

570
00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:56.110
I guess he doesn't want
to sit with us.

571
00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:13.720
- People can see.
- And that would ruin your reputation?

572
00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:15.670
What's that?

573
00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:21.180
I'm reading all the books on Rothman's
list of contemporary American authors.

574
00:44:22.350 --> 00:44:24.420
And how many books are there?

575
00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:26.310
A hundred.

576
00:44:27.310 --> 00:44:30.560
But then there are his British list
and his European list.

577
00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:35.030
So is this on your list,
to read all these books?

578
00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:45.910
Jamie, I'm trying here, okay?

579
00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:48.500
Maybe...

580
00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:52.450
Maybe I miss spending
time with you.

581
00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:56.410
Maybe you inspire me.

582
00:44:57.880 --> 00:44:59.130
Sounds like bull.

583
00:44:59.590 --> 00:45:01.130
- Which part?
- All of it.

584
00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:03.510
- It's not.
- Prove it.

585
00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:13.380
Jamie!

586
00:45:15.730 --> 00:45:18.270
You don't know
how to be a friend.

587
00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:20.350
- I don't want to just be your friend.
- You don't know what you want.

588
00:45:20.530 --> 00:45:23.640
Neither do you. You're scared
someone wants to be with you.

589
00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:27.320
- Why would that scare me?
- You couldn't hide behind your books,

590
00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:29.080
or your telescope...

591
00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:31.940
or your faith.

592
00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:34.410
You know the real reason
why you're scared?

593
00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:37.580
You want to be with me too.

594
00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:02.020
We're going to get
this party jumping!

595
00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:06.140
Can you turn down Soul Train?
Some of us are trying to work.

596
00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:09.520
You really know
how to bust a robot's groove.

597
00:46:10.110 --> 00:46:12.410
But it's all good
because Club Landon

598
00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:15.410
and Club Eric is jumping now.
What we got here?

599
00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:18.980
Okay, okay,

600
00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:22.920
you're not feeling my hip- hop,
but what the hell is this?

601
00:46:23.250 --> 00:46:24.830
Jamie lent it to me.

602
00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:28.540
Now she's got you listening to
her people's music.

603
00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:30.340
Her people?

604
00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:35.080
Yeah, Bible-hugging-crucifix-wearing-

605
00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:37.750
honk-if-you-love-Jesus people.

606
00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:39.510
- She's not like that.
- Well...

607
00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:41.560
You know, you got...

608
00:46:41.970 --> 00:46:46.100
Belinda thinking that little lip action
between you and Jamie was kind of real.

609
00:46:54.070 --> 00:46:58.020
What's with you? You don't have time
for your real friends anymore.

610
00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:00.030
I don't know, buddy.

611
00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:01.860
I'm just over it.

612
00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:05.910
I'm sick and tired of doing
the same old shit all the time.

613
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.080
This girl's changed you
and you don't even know it, man.

614
00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:13.880
- Belinda say that, too?
- No.

615
00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:16.710
I did.

616
00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:29.140
You.

617
00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:31.550
Me.

618
00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:38.730
What is it?

619
00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:40.780
I got you something.

620
00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:46.370
Thank you.

621
00:47:50.370 --> 00:47:52.500
I'll see you at school.

622
00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:54.900
Okay.

623
00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:05.250
Mr. Carter.

624
00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:07.340
Later, Reverend.

625
00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:24.230
Jamie.

626
00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:32.160
Boys like that...

627
00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:35.570
They have...

628
00:48:41.250 --> 00:48:42.500
They have expectations.

629
00:48:44.170 --> 00:48:46.800
The rules around here
aren't going to change.

630
00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:49.050
Fine.

631
00:48:53.970 --> 00:48:56.680
You might not care
what I say or think,

632
00:48:56.850 --> 00:48:58.670
but you should care
about God's opinion.

633
00:49:00.970 --> 00:49:03.600
I think He wants me to be happy.

634
00:49:06.980 --> 00:49:08.640
It's just a sweater.

635
00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:12.990
I'm going to make us dinner.

636
00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:26.860
I talked to your dad today.

637
00:49:27.830 --> 00:49:31.120
Said he say you at the play
for about ten seconds.

638
00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:32.420
Yeah.

639
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:36.200
Sending a check once a month
doesn't exactly make him your father.

640
00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:41.260
Landon, there are a lot of reasons--

641
00:49:41.930 --> 00:49:43.130
He left us.

642
00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:46.640
You need to forgive him, too.

643
00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:54.680
Jamie Sullivan!

644
00:49:55.110 --> 00:49:57.680
Oh me, oh my,
look at Jamie Sullivan.

645
00:49:57.860 --> 00:49:59.900
She was looking all right
in that play.

646
00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:03.060
She does not look hot.

647
00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:06.520
I would have to say
during the play, she looked...

648
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:10.570
- She looked hot.
- I have the best idea.

649
00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:14.000
Can you do something,
like move it?

650
00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:17.420
Move it around a little
something here.

651
00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:19.700
Take one.

652
00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:22.590
That's it.

653
00:50:24.010 --> 00:50:26.300
Let me stop it for a second.
Check it out.

654
00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:31.060
Hey, look at this.

655
00:50:34.770 --> 00:50:35.470
Take one.

656
00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:37.380
Look.

657
00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:43.150
Jamie.

658
00:50:43.610 --> 00:50:45.110
- Hi.
- Hi.

659
00:50:45.690 --> 00:50:49.150
I just want you to no know,
no hard feelings.

660
00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:52.580
Landon and I are way over.

661
00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:56.200
I really don't know
what you're talking about.

662
00:50:58.620 --> 00:50:59.570
Jamie.

663
00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:02.830
You'd be so beautiful

664
00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:05.300
if you knew
how to do your make-up.

665
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:10.130
Come on, eat lunch with me.

666
00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:12.870
- Want a Tic Tac?
- No, thanks.

667
00:51:13.050 --> 00:51:13.920
Okay.

668
00:51:28.770 --> 00:51:29.890
Is that you?

669
00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:37.700
Nice bod.

670
00:52:06.980 --> 00:52:07.730
Look.

671
00:52:08.310 --> 00:52:10.690
This is about me, okay,
this is not you.

672
00:52:12.020 --> 00:52:12.770
Stay here.

673
00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:20.740
Hey, man, no wonder
you been keeping her locked up.

674
00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:23.520
I had no idea
this was underneath all that.

675
00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:28.950
- Dean, stop it!
- You stay out of this!

676
00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:39.250
- We're through.
- That's great.

677
00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:40.590
We're through.

678
00:52:41.210 --> 00:52:42.760
We are through forever!

679
00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:44.470
- You okay?
- You made a mistake, Landon!

680
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:45.750
Sure?

681
00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:47.760
Let's get the hell out of here.

682
00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:50.550
You chickenshit!

683
00:52:52.930 --> 00:52:54.440
Baby, I'm sorry.

684
00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:57.560
Okay?
They're animals, all right?

685
00:52:59.650 --> 00:53:01.070
Want me to take you home?

686
00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:05.180
Let's get out of here.

687
00:53:07.110 --> 00:53:08.770
Are you sure you're okay?

688
00:53:09.870 --> 00:53:10.980
I'm fine.

689
00:53:12.910 --> 00:53:14.290
But thank you for everything.

690
00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:15.780
You're welcome.

691
00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:24.790
I want to ask you something.

692
00:53:25.590 --> 00:53:26.510
Okay.

693
00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:34.880
Will you go out with me
on Saturday night?

694
00:53:39.140 --> 00:53:40.940
I'm sorry. I can't go.

695
00:53:45.610 --> 00:53:48.720
- You got something else going on?
- No.

696
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:50.390
It's not that.

697
00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:52.900
Then what is it?

698
00:53:59.790 --> 00:54:01.410
I'm not allowed to date.

699
00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:07.960
Do not be deceived.

700
00:54:08.290 --> 00:54:10.120
God is not mocked...

701
00:54:13.090 --> 00:54:16.840
Whatever a man sows,
that he shall also reap.

702
00:54:18.140 --> 00:54:19.850
For he who sows to his flesh,

703
00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:22.060
will of the flesh reap--

704
00:54:22.850 --> 00:54:23.710
Can I help you?

705
00:54:24.020 --> 00:54:25.210
Yes, sir.

706
00:54:26.310 --> 00:54:29.760
I'd like to ask your daughter out
to dinner on Saturday night.

707
00:54:30.190 --> 00:54:31.270
That's not possible.

708
00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:36.690
With all due respect, sir...

709
00:54:37.150 --> 00:54:38.740
I ask you to reconsider.

710
00:54:40.410 --> 00:54:43.660
With all due respect, Mr. Carter,
I made my decision.

711
00:54:46.790 --> 00:54:49.900
You can exit
the way you entered.

712
00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:58.210
Listen, I'm sorry I haven't treated
Jamie the way I should have.

713
00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:00.880
She deserves more than that.

714
00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:06.510
I'm just asking you
for the same thing you teach us

715
00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:07.510
everyday in church.

716
00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:11.850
And that is faith.

717
00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:21.930
I can't believe you asked
my father's permission.

718
00:55:22.110 --> 00:55:24.320
It's no big deal.
He was cool about it.

719
00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:26.020
Thank you.

720
00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:28.230
- This is for you.
- Thank you very much.

721
00:55:28.870 --> 00:55:30.860
Would you like
something to drink?

722
00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:32.080
Sweet tea, please.

723
00:55:32.410 --> 00:55:33.870
- Make that two.
- Right away.

724
00:55:37.790 --> 00:55:40.910
This restaurant is really nice,
are you sure this is okay?

725
00:55:41.290 --> 00:55:44.050
- Don't even worry about it, okay?
- Okay.

726
00:55:44.210 --> 00:55:45.710
Choose whatever you want.

727
00:55:47.340 --> 00:55:49.580
So, what will it be?

728
00:55:50.930 --> 00:55:52.010
Is everything okay?

729
00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:56.090
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah, me too, thanks.

730
00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:05.360
Would you like to dance?

731
00:56:08.190 --> 00:56:10.570
Sorry, I don't dance.

732
00:56:11.450 --> 00:56:14.900
Me neither. I mean,
not usually in front of anybody.

733
00:56:15.410 --> 00:56:18.290
Well, no. I mean,
I don't...

734
00:56:18.490 --> 00:56:20.450
at all, as in, I can't.

735
00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:23.170
Everybody can dance.

736
00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:26.370
Come on, you can't be that bad.

737
00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:29.500
Please?

738
00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:32.000
For me?

739
00:56:34.130 --> 00:56:35.080
Come on.

740
00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:51.270
Sorry.

741
00:56:51.730 --> 00:56:53.720
I told you I was bad at this.

742
00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:57.070
But, in all fairness,
you did warn me, right?

743
00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:58.240
That's right.

744
00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:02.370
So...

745
00:57:03.740 --> 00:57:05.950
what's number one on your list?

746
00:57:09.210 --> 00:57:09.960
Okay.

747
00:57:11.710 --> 00:57:13.530
Number one on my list is...

748
00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:15.550
getting out of Beaufort.

749
00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:19.790
I don't think getting out
is going to be a problem.

750
00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:23.960
It's more like figuring out
what do to when you get somewhere.

751
00:57:25.220 --> 00:57:26.600
What do you mean?

752
00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:31.420
I mean, you can do anything.

753
00:57:49.370 --> 00:57:52.120
- Where are we going?
- Just hold on, you'll see.

754
00:57:57.210 --> 00:57:59.880
Come on, come on.
Let's go!

755
00:58:00.290 --> 00:58:02.200
- What are we doing?
- Run!

756
00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:05.880
Okay, okay.
Stand there.

757
00:58:06.050 --> 00:58:07.630
- All right.
- One foot there

758
00:58:08.050 --> 00:58:09.760
and one foot here.
- Okay.

759
00:58:12.890 --> 00:58:15.640
You're acting like a crazy person.
What's going on?

760
00:58:15.850 --> 00:58:19.020
Right now,
you're straddling the state line.

761
00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:22.020
Okay.

762
00:58:25.230 --> 00:58:27.310
You're in two places at once.

763
00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:39.750
Okay.

764
00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:43.460
Butterfly, rosebud or star?

765
00:58:44.830 --> 00:58:45.620
You choose.

766
00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:49.660
Butterfly.

767
00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:50.840
Okay.

768
00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:53.670
So...

769
00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:57.790
Where do you want it?

770
00:59:01.930 --> 00:59:03.020
Right here.

771
00:59:11.570 --> 00:59:12.400
Okay.

772
01:00:20.130 --> 01:00:22.510
How can you see
places like this...

773
01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:27.830
and have moments like this,
and not believe?

774
01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:32.880
You're lucky to be so sure.

775
01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:39.440
It's like the wind.

776
01:00:40.730 --> 01:00:44.180
I can't see it, but I feel it.

777
01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:46.900
What do you feel?

778
01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:52.520
I feel wonder

779
01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:54.480
and beauty

780
01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:56.730
joy,

781
01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:58.530
love...

782
01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:03.200
It's the center of everything.

783
01:01:08.170 --> 01:01:09.630
I might kiss you.

784
01:01:12.590 --> 01:01:14.330
I might be bad at it.

785
01:01:18.430 --> 01:01:19.710
That's not possible.

786
01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:36.280
Jamie...

787
01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.500
I love you.

788
01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:01.300
Now...

789
01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:04.050
would be the time
to say something.

790
01:02:07.310 --> 01:02:09.630
I told you not to fall
in love with me.

791
01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:18.990
Jamie!

792
01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:21.240
Say good night to Mr. Carter.

793
01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:26.340
Landon, go home.
The night's over.

794
01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:28.800
- Good night.
- Good night.

795
01:03:29.130 --> 01:03:30.300
Good night, sir.

796
01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:36.750
Jamie, your behavior's sinful.

797
01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:39.010
You...

798
01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:41.810
- You act with that boy like you're--
- In love?

799
01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:45.610
Jamie, you are a child.

800
01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:46.820
Dad,

801
01:03:48.150 --> 01:03:49.810
look at me. I'm not a child.

802
01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:51.730
Then stop acting childish!

803
01:03:55.870 --> 01:03:57.060
I love him.

804
01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:04.000
Then be fair to him, Jamie,
before things get worse.

805
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:27.730
- Hi.
- Hi.

806
01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:32.770
- Will you help me?
- Yeah.

807
01:04:34.190 --> 01:04:36.490
So, what did you tell your father?

808
01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:40.070
The truth,
I just left you out of it.

809
01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:43.780
What do you want to see?

810
01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:46.740
Pluto.

811
01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:50.280
Pluto only rises
a few minutes before the sun.

812
01:04:50.910 --> 01:04:52.540
Right, and...

813
01:04:53.790 --> 01:04:54.880
I have brought us...

814
01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:57.800
a thermos of hot coffee...

815
01:04:58.840 --> 01:04:59.950
and...

816
01:05:00.590 --> 01:05:01.590
a blanket.

817
01:05:03.050 --> 01:05:06.250
- You planned this.
- Oh, I hoped for it.

818
01:05:09.390 --> 01:05:10.850
Are you trying to seduce me?

819
01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:13.510
Why, are you seducible?

820
01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:18.760
That's what I thought, ergo...

821
01:05:19.270 --> 01:05:22.190
a second blanket.

822
01:05:22.940 --> 01:05:24.570
One for me and one for you.

823
01:05:25.030 --> 01:05:25.860
Thank you.

824
01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:41.340
Can you find this star here?

825
01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:42.660
Sure.

826
01:05:53.930 --> 01:05:56.680
So why am I looking for this star?

827
01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:00.480
Because I had it named for you.

828
01:06:03.310 --> 01:06:04.400
See?

829
01:06:05.770 --> 01:06:06.690
It's official.

830
01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:12.060
It's from the International
Star Registry.

831
01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:17.530
This is wonderful!

832
01:06:23.410 --> 01:06:24.500
I love you.

833
01:06:38.470 --> 01:06:40.260
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

834
01:06:40.970 --> 01:06:42.060
I'm stopping.

835
01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:53.940
So, what's your number one?

836
01:06:59.070 --> 01:07:01.650
To marry in the church
where my mother grew up.

837
01:07:03.030 --> 01:07:04.940
That's where my parents
were married.

838
01:07:35.190 --> 01:07:37.350
- Did you just get in?
- Yeah.

839
01:07:39.530 --> 01:07:42.360
Thank heavens I didn't know,
I would've been panicked.

840
01:07:42.530 --> 01:07:43.640
Sorry.

841
01:07:45.110 --> 01:07:46.110
Landon?

842
01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:48.570
Were you with Jamie?

843
01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:52.860
Landon, be careful,
she's the Reverend's daughter.

844
01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:54.410
- Mom--
- Please!

845
01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.660
It's different with her.

846
01:07:58.210 --> 01:07:59.580
It's different with her.

847
01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:00.920
Yes.

848
01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:05.470
It better be
different with her.

849
01:08:09.090 --> 01:08:12.380
I was doing laundry the other day
and I found this.

850
01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:23.480
''Examine a moon rock.

851
01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:27.520
Go to College.

852
01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:30.560
Get into medical school.''

853
01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:36.230
Honey...

854
01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:41.210
These are really
beautiful ambitions.

855
01:08:42.290 --> 01:08:43.160
But...

856
01:08:44.290 --> 01:08:45.790
you're going to have
to work really hard.

857
01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:47.500
I can do that.

858
01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:53.040
Yeah, you can.

859
01:08:58.100 --> 01:08:59.010
Mama...

860
01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:03.730
Jamie has faith in me.

861
01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:06.600
You know?

862
01:09:07.940 --> 01:09:09.560
She makes me want to be...

863
01:09:10.190 --> 01:09:11.220
different.

864
01:09:13.150 --> 01:09:14.100
Better.

865
01:09:16.150 --> 01:09:19.160
I was so drunk,
I don't remember anything.

866
01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:28.070
That's great.
Citizen high to citizen low.

867
01:09:31.130 --> 01:09:34.050
Are you worried
about your college applications?

868
01:09:35.550 --> 01:09:36.300
No.

869
01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:40.380
- I'm not applying to college.
- I thought you said--

870
01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:41.390
No,

871
01:09:41.930 --> 01:09:43.350
you assumed.

872
01:09:43.510 --> 01:09:46.140
Take a year off,
try the Peace Corps?

873
01:09:46.310 --> 01:09:46.920
No.

874
01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:51.350
What are you going to do?

875
01:09:55.940 --> 01:09:57.110
I'm sick.

876
01:09:57.820 --> 01:10:00.570
- I'll take you home, you'll be better--
- No, Landon!

877
01:10:02.570 --> 01:10:03.600
I'm sick.

878
01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:09.150
I have leukemia.

879
01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:16.880
No.

880
01:10:18.290 --> 01:10:20.960
- You're eighteen, you're perfect.
- No,

881
01:10:21.210 --> 01:10:24.970
I found out two years ago.
I've stopped responding to treatments.

882
01:10:30.850 --> 01:10:32.430
So why didn't you tell me?

883
01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:36.140
The doctor said I should go on
and live life normally,

884
01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:38.300
as best I could.

885
01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:41.140
I didn't want anyone
to be weird around me.

886
01:10:41.310 --> 01:10:43.610
- Including me?
- Especially you!

887
01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:50.740
I was getting along fine.
I accepted it,

888
01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:52.620
and then you happened!

889
01:10:57.040 --> 01:11:00.620
I do not need a reason
to be angry with God.

890
01:12:09.810 --> 01:12:11.400
Dad, open the door!

891
01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:23.820
Landon?

892
01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:27.370
I need your help.

893
01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:31.690
- What's wrong, are you okay?
- It's my girlfriend Jamie, she's...

894
01:12:34.370 --> 01:12:35.630
She's got cancer.

895
01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:39.420
And I need you to come
and see her right now.

896
01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:40.760
Okay. Calm down.

897
01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:42.550
Can you help me or not?

898
01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:45.010
I don't know her case,

899
01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:48.050
I don't know her history.
I'd have to talk to her physician.

900
01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:49.340
I'm a cardiologist.
I can't--

901
01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:51.470
Just forget it.

902
01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:53.880
I knew it.

903
01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:56.470
Would you wait? Landon, wait!

904
01:14:35.650 --> 01:14:37.190
You're mom called me.

905
01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:40.740
Talk to me, man.

906
01:14:41.860 --> 01:14:42.980
About what?

907
01:14:46.370 --> 01:14:47.400
About you...

908
01:14:48.540 --> 01:14:49.570
about Jamie.

909
01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:55.420
What's there to talk about?

910
01:14:58.250 --> 01:15:00.460
She's the best person
I've ever known.

911
01:15:05.550 --> 01:15:06.970
I didn't understand.

912
01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:14.730
It's okay, man.

913
01:15:17.190 --> 01:15:18.270
It's okay.

914
01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:42.620
It's so nice to see you again.

915
01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:44.580
You're welcome.
Watch yourself now.

916
01:15:47.630 --> 01:15:48.660
Landon...

917
01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:50.470
I'm not going anywhere.

918
01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:53.430
Please tell Jamie that.

919
01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:24.960
I'm so sorry.

920
01:16:26.830 --> 01:16:28.710
I really should have
told you sooner.

921
01:16:29.090 --> 01:16:31.130
No, I made you do
too many things--

922
01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:33.540
If anything,
you kept me healthy longer.

923
01:16:43.930 --> 01:16:45.050
Are you scared?

924
01:16:47.350 --> 01:16:48.350
To death.

925
01:16:52.190 --> 01:16:52.860
Lighten up.

926
01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:55.570
It's not funny.

927
01:17:17.710 --> 01:17:19.950
I'm scared of not being with you.

928
01:17:24.510 --> 01:17:26.300
Oh, baby, that'll never happen.

929
01:17:36.980 --> 01:17:38.260
I'll be here.

930
01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:42.320
Mom?

931
01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:46.910
Can you do me a favor?

932
01:19:15.940 --> 01:19:17.110
So...

933
01:19:19.870 --> 01:19:21.240
I talked to Eric.

934
01:19:28.790 --> 01:19:30.210
Need some help with this stuff?

935
01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:32.990
Sure.

936
01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:13.610
Jamie, what's that boy
doing in the yard?

937
01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:18.210
What's the matter?

938
01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:19.830
Jamie, honey.

939
01:21:25.980 --> 01:21:27.010
Landon.

940
01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:29.770
Go on home, son.

941
01:21:30.610 --> 01:21:31.980
I'm not tired.

942
01:21:34.490 --> 01:21:36.780
I need just a minute with her.

943
01:21:45.370 --> 01:21:46.960
I'll be back, okay?

944
01:21:47.250 --> 01:21:48.250
Okay.

945
01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:13.610
Daddy...

946
01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:17.820
so serious.

947
01:22:28.580 --> 01:22:29.910
Do you remember...

948
01:22:30.370 --> 01:22:32.030
when you were about...

949
01:22:32.540 --> 01:22:34.080
five or six...

950
01:22:34.790 --> 01:22:37.030
and you said
you hated gravity...

951
01:22:38.250 --> 01:22:41.210
and you wanted to jump off
the roof and fly?

952
01:22:44.010 --> 01:22:47.790
I was so angry at you
for making me come down.

953
01:22:48.930 --> 01:22:50.890
Honey, if I kept you too close

954
01:22:51.890 --> 01:22:54.100
it's because
I wanted to keep you longer.

955
01:22:55.310 --> 01:22:56.430
Dad...

956
01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:02.510
You know,

957
01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:04.810
when I lost your mother...

958
01:23:10.700 --> 01:23:13.660
I was afraid that my heart
would never open again.

959
01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.210
Jamie, I couldn't
look at you for days!

960
01:23:32.050 --> 01:23:33.140
But, then...

961
01:23:38.260 --> 01:23:40.220
I love you so much.

962
01:24:06.870 --> 01:24:08.580
- Hi.
- Hi.

963
01:24:09.130 --> 01:24:10.590
I wanted to give you these.

964
01:24:12.340 --> 01:24:13.880
The pictures from the play.

965
01:24:20.890 --> 01:24:22.390
I'm sorry about the flyers.

966
01:24:22.970 --> 01:24:24.350
Hey, it doesn't matter.

967
01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:26.430
Yeah.

968
01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:30.510
I guess you're
with who you should be.

969
01:24:32.980 --> 01:24:34.400
It's like she chose you.

970
01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:38.400
Yeah, I don't even know why.

971
01:24:42.410 --> 01:24:43.440
I do.

972
01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:25.560
How you feeling?

973
01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:29.110
- I'm okay, how are you?
- Pretty good.

974
01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:32.370
- I have something for you.
- You do?

975
01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:40.240
Don't worry, it's not a Bible.

976
01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:44.030
It was my mother's.
It's got...

977
01:25:45.210 --> 01:25:47.420
quotes from her favorite
books and...

978
01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:50.630
quotes by famous people.

979
01:25:51.380 --> 01:25:52.250
Her thoughts.

980
01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:55.250
Come on.

981
01:25:55.970 --> 01:25:57.390
Okay, let's check it out.

982
01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:05.150
Okay.

983
01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:07.640
''What is a friend?''

984
01:26:08.570 --> 01:26:11.190
''It's a single soul
dwelling in two bodies.''

985
01:26:11.780 --> 01:26:12.980
Aristotle.

986
01:26:14.450 --> 01:26:15.230
Right here.

987
01:26:15.870 --> 01:26:16.730
Okay.

988
01:26:18.530 --> 01:26:20.120
''Find out who you are...

989
01:26:21.330 --> 01:26:22.830
and do it on purpose.''

990
01:26:25.210 --> 01:26:26.240
That's Dolly Parton.

991
01:26:28.590 --> 01:26:30.550
I always thought she was smart.

992
01:26:41.140 --> 01:26:43.850
''Love is always patient and kind,

993
01:26:44.770 --> 01:26:45.800
it is never jealous.

994
01:26:47.810 --> 01:26:50.480
Love is never
boastful or conceited.

995
01:26:52.020 --> 01:26:53.480
It is never rude

996
01:26:53.730 --> 01:26:54.980
or selfish.

997
01:26:55.650 --> 01:26:57.560
It does not take offense...

998
01:26:58.110 --> 01:26:59.700
and is not resentful.''

999
01:27:09.540 --> 01:27:11.080
You know what I figured out today?

1000
01:27:11.580 --> 01:27:12.420
What?

1001
01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:18.460
Maybe God...

1002
01:27:20.470 --> 01:27:22.540
has a bigger plan for me

1003
01:27:23.430 --> 01:27:25.010
than I had for myself.

1004
01:27:26.550 --> 01:27:27.470
Like,

1005
01:27:28.390 --> 01:27:30.430
this journey never ends.

1006
01:27:33.190 --> 01:27:36.440
Like, you were sent to me
because I'm sick...

1007
01:27:40.610 --> 01:27:42.400
to help me through all this.

1008
01:27:54.620 --> 01:27:56.000
You're my angel.

1009
01:28:14.970 --> 01:28:17.930
- What's going on?
- I get to go home.

1010
01:28:18.140 --> 01:28:20.380
Please thank your father for me.

1011
01:28:21.350 --> 01:28:22.440
What does she mean?

1012
01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:24.400
Your father's been trying
to reach you.

1013
01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:28.070
He's going to pay
for private home care.

1014
01:28:58.600 --> 01:28:59.680
Thank you.

1015
01:29:20.490 --> 01:29:21.520
Sorry.

1016
01:29:24.540 --> 01:29:26.000
It's all right.

1017
01:30:03.650 --> 01:30:05.560
I have to finish this tonight.

1018
01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:07.780
Here, something hot.

1019
01:30:11.660 --> 01:30:14.370
I'm almost finished with the rocker.
Did she order the mirrors?

1020
01:30:14.540 --> 01:30:16.330
Yeah, they're in here.

1021
01:30:17.250 --> 01:30:20.920
- What are you using for side bearings?
- An old phonographic turntable.

1022
01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:24.210
Do you think
you'll get it done by tomorrow?

1023
01:30:27.430 --> 01:30:29.640
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1024
01:30:30.930 --> 01:30:32.180
It's beautiful.

1025
01:30:33.220 --> 01:30:35.050
Okay, it's time. Go check it out.

1026
01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:37.230
Okay.

1027
01:31:16.550 --> 01:31:17.720
There it is.

1028
01:31:20.810 --> 01:31:21.920
Come here.

1029
01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:23.770
Come look.

1030
01:31:26.230 --> 01:31:28.050
Come look, quick.

1031
01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:39.740
That is cool.

1032
01:31:50.500 --> 01:31:51.840
Do you love me?

1033
01:31:59.510 --> 01:32:01.420
Will you do something for me, then?

1034
01:32:01.720 --> 01:32:02.800
Anything.

1035
01:32:07.310 --> 01:32:08.730
Will you marry me?

1036
01:33:33.970 --> 01:33:37.720
Love is always
patient and kind.

1037
01:33:38.850 --> 01:33:40.390
It is never jealous.

1038
01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:41.390
I love you.

1039
01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:42.670
It is never boast-full...

1040
01:33:42.850 --> 01:33:43.630
I love you.

1041
01:33:43.810 --> 01:33:45.090
...or conceited.

1042
01:33:45.900 --> 01:33:48.360
It is never rude or selfish.

1043
01:33:48.650 --> 01:33:50.440
It does not take offense

1044
01:33:51.190 --> 01:33:52.990
and is not resentful.

1045
01:33:53.740 --> 01:33:55.700
Love takes no pleasure

1046
01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:58.200
in other peoples' sins...

1047
01:33:58.410 --> 01:34:00.980
but delights in the truth.

1048
01:34:02.410 --> 01:34:04.790
It is always ready to excuse

1049
01:34:05.330 --> 01:34:07.240
to trust, to hope

1050
01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:09.670
and to endure...

1051
01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:13.340
whatever comes.

1052
01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:15.910
I,

1053
01:34:16.510 --> 01:34:17.760
Landon Rollins Carter...

1054
01:34:17.930 --> 01:34:20.390
I, Jamie Elizabeth Sullivan,
do solemnly swear...

1055
01:34:20.550 --> 01:34:23.510
...do solemnly swear to take
Jamie Elizabeth Sullivan...

1056
01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:25.500
...to take
Landon Rollins Carter...

1057
01:34:26.270 --> 01:34:28.560
- ...as my lawfully wedded wife...
- ...as my lawfully wedded husband...

1058
01:34:28.730 --> 01:34:30.630
...to honor and to cherish her...

1059
01:34:30.940 --> 01:34:33.560
- ...all the days of my life.
- ...all the days of my life.

1060
01:34:54.420 --> 01:34:57.530
Jamie and I had
a perfect summer together,

1061
01:34:58.380 --> 01:34:59.630
with more love

1062
01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:02.420
than lots of people know
in a lifetime.

1063
01:35:03.260 --> 01:35:06.840
And then she went
with her unfailing faith.

1064
01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:31.830
It's been four years...

1065
01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:36.870
but the vision of Jamie
walking towards me...

1066
01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:40.860
will stay with me forever.

1067
01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:45.550
Hello, Mr. Carter. Come in.

1068
01:35:53.300 --> 01:35:55.460
- Have a seat, please.
- Thank you.

1069
01:36:03.690 --> 01:36:04.770
Landon.

1070
01:36:09.190 --> 01:36:11.520
- You g look good.
- Thank you. You too.

1071
01:36:12.030 --> 01:36:13.310
I'm getting by.

1072
01:36:25.670 --> 01:36:27.380
What's new, Landon?

1073
01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.410
I got into medical school.

1074
01:36:30.590 --> 01:36:32.300
Your mother told me that.

1075
01:36:33.260 --> 01:36:34.590
We're so proud of you.

1076
01:36:36.170 --> 01:36:37.880
Jamie would have been
proud of you too.

1077
01:36:41.220 --> 01:36:42.090
Listen.

1078
01:36:48.850 --> 01:36:50.310
I want you...

1079
01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:52.980
to have this.

1080
01:36:54.070 --> 01:36:55.270
Oh, Landon.

1081
01:37:02.370 --> 01:37:03.650
Oh, my.

1082
01:37:07.290 --> 01:37:08.240
Thank you.

1083
01:37:12.920 --> 01:37:15.410
I'm sorry
she never got her miracle.

1084
01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:22.500
She did.

1085
01:37:25.090 --> 01:37:26.260
It was you.

1086
01:37:35.980 --> 01:37:38.050
Jamie saved my life.

1087
01:37:39.770 --> 01:37:41.360
She taught me everything

1088
01:37:42.990 --> 01:37:44.440
about life,

1089
01:37:44.820 --> 01:37:45.900
hope

1090
01:37:46.570 --> 01:37:48.480
and the long journey ahead.

1091
01:37:50.700 --> 01:37:52.330
I'll always miss her.

1092
01:37:54.450 --> 01:37:55.870
But our love...

1093
01:37:56.910 --> 01:37:58.290
is like the wind.

1094
01:38:00.290 --> 01:38:01.460
I can't see it,

1095
01:38:03.170 --> 01:38:04.370
but I can feel it
