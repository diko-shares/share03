1
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.038
- It was irresponsible.

2
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.207
- Irresponsible?
- Absolutely.

3
00:00:39.248 --> 00:00:40.458
They spent what?

4
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.294
A trillion dollars plus
countless man hours,

5
00:00:43.336 --> 00:00:45.046
not to mention
political capital,

6
00:00:45.088 --> 00:00:47.924
trying to get one dude back
from Mars.

7
00:00:47.965 --> 00:00:50.218
- Political capital?
It united the world.

8
00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:52.887
- Yeah, for a hot second,
but what if they failed?

9
00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:54.406
Everyone would have been
like, um, excuse me,

10
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.224
you know there are
people dying here, right?

11
00:00:56.265 --> 00:00:57.409
- People are always
dying on Earth.

12
00:00:57.433 --> 00:00:58.893
You can't change that.

13
00:00:58.935 --> 00:01:00.746
But if you get the opportunity
to bring back Matt Damon...

14
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.688
- No, screw Matt Damon.

15
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.148
- That's just harsh.

16
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.901
- Dude, it costs an average
of $1,200 to save a life.

17
00:01:06.943 --> 00:01:08.069
- 12... what?

18
00:01:08.111 --> 00:01:09.946
- When you give money to
charity...

19
00:01:09.987 --> 00:01:11.256
The ones that are actually
gonna save lives

20
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.758
are the ones that clean
water and give out

21
00:01:12.782 --> 00:01:14.075
medicine and stuff, right?

22
00:01:14.117 --> 00:01:15.952
- Matt Damon's charity
literally cleans water.

23
00:01:15.993 --> 00:01:17.638
- So when you factor in
administrative costs,

24
00:01:17.662 --> 00:01:20.206
and how many people would
actually die without help,

25
00:01:20.248 --> 00:01:22.333
that works out to
1,200 bucks per life.

26
00:01:22.375 --> 00:01:24.144
- Okay, so what you're saying
is, you take a trillion

27
00:01:24.168 --> 00:01:26.796
and divided by 1,200
and you can save

28
00:01:26.838 --> 00:01:32.009
833 million people's lives
on Earth?

29
00:01:32.051 --> 00:01:33.845
- You just do that math
right now?

30
00:01:33.886 --> 00:01:35.179
- I'm wicked smart.

31
00:01:35.221 --> 00:01:39.600
- I know, it's just,
you look like so dumb.

32
00:01:39.642 --> 00:01:41.018
- Okay.

33
00:01:42.228 --> 00:01:43.228
Checkmate.

34
00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:46.983
- Dang.
- Boom.

35
00:01:48.818 --> 00:01:49.986
- Okay.

36
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.543
- You really don't think

37
00:02:05.585 --> 00:02:08.004
they're sending anybody
to save us?

38
00:02:09.922 --> 00:02:10.965
- I mean...

39
00:02:13.176 --> 00:02:15.470
I'm sure they're doing
what they can.

40
00:02:15.511 --> 00:02:17.805
Within reason.

41
00:02:19.307 --> 00:02:21.434
Benson would probably
take your side.

42
00:02:21.476 --> 00:02:24.020
- Yeah, well, Benson went crazy.

43
00:02:29.108 --> 00:02:31.861
- Play again?
- You wanna lose again?

44
00:02:35.448 --> 00:02:36.884
- I just don't think
we should wait around

45
00:02:36.908 --> 00:02:38.409
to be saved, you know?

46
00:02:38.451 --> 00:02:40.161
We gotta save ourselves.

47
00:02:40.203 --> 00:02:43.790
- Or accept the inevitability
of our fates.

48
00:02:43.831 --> 00:02:46.793
- One of the two.

49
00:02:46.834 --> 00:02:48.586
- Two of the three.

50
00:02:48.628 --> 00:02:51.381
- Three of the four.
- Comme ci, comme Ã§a.

51
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.930
- Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!

52
00:03:46.018 --> 00:03:49.313
You might as well give up now.
I'm clearly dominating you.

53
00:03:49.355 --> 00:03:51.065
- I'll dominate your face!

54
00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:49.539
- Yes.

55
00:04:54.837 --> 00:04:56.130
- Wait, two?

56
00:04:56.172 --> 00:04:57.799
Don't you only have,
like, ten left?

57
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.218
- Yeah, I know, but...

58
00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:02.845
my blueberry and marijuana
hybrid won't flower,

59
00:05:02.887 --> 00:05:06.224
so blowing off some steam.

60
00:05:09.394 --> 00:05:11.229
- Well, go nuts, kid.

61
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.398
But don't pop and drive.

62
00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:14.482
Pew.

63
00:05:24.992 --> 00:05:25.993
Morning.

64
00:05:26.035 --> 00:05:27.537
Your mama called!

65
00:05:27.578 --> 00:05:30.706
She said she doesn't miss you
and you're gonna lose.

66
00:05:30.748 --> 00:05:32.375
Your mama called.

67
00:05:32.417 --> 00:05:34.293
And she said she's your sister,

68
00:05:34.335 --> 00:05:36.671
you smell like poop,
and you're gonna lose.

69
00:05:36.713 --> 00:05:38.589
- My mom is my sister?

70
00:05:44.887 --> 00:05:46.264
- Come on, we gon' watch
a movie.

71
00:05:46.305 --> 00:05:48.683
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

72
00:05:49.892 --> 00:05:53.604
Okay.

73
00:05:53.646 --> 00:05:56.524
- "Die Hard."
- "Casablanca."

74
00:05:56.566 --> 00:05:58.526
- "Die Hard."
- "Casablanca." Come on.

75
00:05:58.568 --> 00:06:00.129
"Casablanca" is
the best love story ever.

76
00:06:00.153 --> 00:06:01.738
- Blargh.

77
00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:03.114
I want Hans Gruber.

78
00:06:03.156 --> 00:06:04.282
- Why would you do that?

79
00:06:04.323 --> 00:06:06.743
Hans Gruber.

80
00:06:06.784 --> 00:06:07.784
- Okay.

81
00:06:09.746 --> 00:06:12.874
"Sense and Sensibility."

82
00:06:12.915 --> 00:06:15.877
It's Hans Gruber
in a love story.

83
00:06:15.918 --> 00:06:17.628
Come on.

84
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:19.505
- Okay.
- Boom. Look at that.

85
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.763
Get comfortable.
This is kinda great.

86
00:07:15.978 --> 00:07:16.978
Hey, girl.

87
00:07:21.484 --> 00:07:23.778
- Error. Comms fail.

88
00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.656
Please contact your nearest
NASA representative.

89
00:07:31.119 --> 00:07:32.537
- Hello.

90
00:07:32.578 --> 00:07:33.578
Earth?

91
00:07:38.501 --> 00:07:40.712
It's your girl DJ J-J-Jane.

92
00:07:40.753 --> 00:07:43.339
Coming to you live
from outer space.

93
00:07:43.381 --> 00:07:45.550
And we've got a sick lineup
for you all,

94
00:07:45.591 --> 00:07:49.303
so buckle up and enjoy the ride.

95
00:07:50.471 --> 00:07:52.557
- Navigation failed.

96
00:08:29.177 --> 00:08:30.678
- You ready?

97
00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.096
- Dur.

98
00:08:32.138 --> 00:08:34.682
Well, have you tried the
raspberries or the blackberry?

99
00:08:34.724 --> 00:08:36.267
- Yes, I've tried everything.

100
00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:38.978
But the blueberry is the one
that's most genetically in line

101
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:42.398
with the marijuana plant,
so it should work.

102
00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.276
- Well, I believe in you.

103
00:08:45.318 --> 00:08:46.277
You'll figure it out.

104
00:08:46.319 --> 00:08:48.196
- Thanks, Mom.

105
00:08:48.237 --> 00:08:50.364
- All right.
What's the verdict?

106
00:08:50.406 --> 00:08:53.493
You're gonna see.

107
00:08:53.534 --> 00:08:56.204
No.

108
00:08:56.245 --> 00:09:00.708
No, not the cowboy hat.

109
00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:04.629
- Can you at least play Dolly?

110
00:09:05.963 --> 00:09:07.215
Not gonna happen.

111
00:09:07.256 --> 00:09:08.567
- When you played Bieber,
I didn't say anything.

112
00:09:08.591 --> 00:09:10.385
It's my turn,
and I wanna two-step.

113
00:09:10.426 --> 00:09:12.303
We can two-step, that is fine,

114
00:09:12.345 --> 00:09:16.391
but could we do it to something
less soul suckingly awful?

115
00:09:16.432 --> 00:09:18.726
- No.
- Please?

116
00:09:18.768 --> 00:09:20.454
Come on, I'm sure
you have something in there

117
00:09:20.478 --> 00:09:23.064
that's actually good.

118
00:09:23.106 --> 00:09:24.273
- Okay.

119
00:09:31.739 --> 00:09:32.990
- Ooh.

120
00:09:33.032 --> 00:09:35.410
Yeah.

121
00:09:35.451 --> 00:09:37.203
Now you go forward.

122
00:09:37.245 --> 00:09:38.413
Bring it back.

123
00:09:38.454 --> 00:09:41.416
Then it's one, two,
three, jump rope.

124
00:09:41.457 --> 00:09:43.835
- That's cute.
- Then you turn.

125
00:09:43.876 --> 00:09:46.587
- You did this lots, right?
- Yeah.

126
00:09:46.629 --> 00:09:48.715
One, two, three, then you jump.

127
00:09:48.756 --> 00:09:50.133
Hey.
- Okay, okay.

128
00:09:50.174 --> 00:09:52.093
Turn.

129
00:09:52.135 --> 00:09:53.261
- Okay.

130
00:09:55.096 --> 00:09:56.556
Hey.

131
00:09:56.597 --> 00:09:58.558
- Ha, ha, ha, turn.

132
00:10:02.145 --> 00:10:04.147
Hey! ho-ho-ho!

133
00:10:04.188 --> 00:10:06.774
Clap. Bang!

134
00:10:09.485 --> 00:10:10.528
Give me that snake.

135
00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:14.907
Pause. Get it. Get it.

136
00:10:17.326 --> 00:10:19.495
Whoo!

137
00:10:23.166 --> 00:10:24.834
- There it is. There it is.

138
00:10:24.876 --> 00:10:27.879
Go back, go back.

139
00:10:32.425 --> 00:10:34.135
We're turning.

140
00:10:35.803 --> 00:10:37.472
- So...

141
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:41.142
I need to call
you out on something.

142
00:10:41.184 --> 00:10:43.144
- Okay.

143
00:10:43.186 --> 00:10:46.022
- I was walking through
the greenhouse this morning,

144
00:10:46.064 --> 00:10:50.568
and I stepped
in some milky goop.

145
00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:54.614
My bad.

146
00:10:54.655 --> 00:10:56.074
- Dude.
- What?

147
00:10:56.115 --> 00:10:57.217
I thought I cleaned it all up.

148
00:10:57.241 --> 00:10:59.786
- That's where our food grows.

149
00:10:59.827 --> 00:11:01.537
That's where the girls sleep.

150
00:11:03.039 --> 00:11:05.041
My God, were they...
Watching you?

151
00:11:05.083 --> 00:11:07.335
- They're chickens.

152
00:11:07.377 --> 00:11:08.628
- Ew.
- All right.

153
00:11:08.669 --> 00:11:10.004
That's enough slut shaming.

154
00:11:10.046 --> 00:11:11.339
- I am not shaming you.

155
00:11:11.381 --> 00:11:13.841
Masturbation is, like,
super healthy.

156
00:11:13.883 --> 00:11:17.845
But I keep it in my room
because I'm not a dirty ho.

157
00:11:17.887 --> 00:11:19.931
- Dirty ho?

158
00:11:24.519 --> 00:11:26.479
Maybe we should do it.

159
00:11:26.521 --> 00:11:28.064
- Do what?

160
00:11:28.106 --> 00:11:29.357
- It.

161
00:11:32.276 --> 00:11:34.404
- What?
- What?

162
00:11:37.073 --> 00:11:38.449
- What? I'm serious.

163
00:11:38.491 --> 00:11:40.118
Man. He's lost it.

164
00:11:40.159 --> 00:11:43.704
- Look, in case
you haven't noticed,

165
00:11:43.746 --> 00:11:45.808
we're doomed to spend the
rest of our miserable lives

166
00:11:45.832 --> 00:11:48.126
floating around on this ship.

167
00:11:48.167 --> 00:11:50.086
So it would be crazy
for us not to bang, right?

168
00:11:50.128 --> 00:11:52.463
- Well, when you put it
like that.

169
00:11:52.505 --> 00:11:54.674
So you're in?

170
00:11:54.716 --> 00:11:56.968
- No.
- Why not?

171
00:11:57.009 --> 00:11:58.761
Look, first of all,

172
00:11:58.803 --> 00:12:01.723
I don't need a reason
not to sleep with you.

173
00:12:01.764 --> 00:12:05.184
I need a reason
to have sex with you.

174
00:12:05.226 --> 00:12:07.061
Floating through space.

175
00:12:07.103 --> 00:12:08.438
Boredom.

176
00:12:08.479 --> 00:12:09.897
The fact that,
other than Benson,

177
00:12:09.939 --> 00:12:12.108
I'm your only viable option.

178
00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:17.572
- See, I can think
of three excellent reasons

179
00:12:17.613 --> 00:12:20.533
right off the top of my head
why we shouldn't,

180
00:12:20.575 --> 00:12:23.119
as you put it so romantically,
bang.

181
00:12:23.161 --> 00:12:24.412
Okay.

182
00:12:24.454 --> 00:12:27.582
Well, moment of clarification.

183
00:12:27.623 --> 00:12:29.751
I'm not talking
about romance, okay?

184
00:12:29.792 --> 00:12:32.462
This is completely
void of emotion.

185
00:12:32.503 --> 00:12:34.005
All right?

186
00:12:34.047 --> 00:12:37.258
This is all about us
using sex as a stress reliever.

187
00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.760
No, I get it.

188
00:12:38.801 --> 00:12:40.887
- Okay,
so what are your three great...

189
00:12:42.805 --> 00:12:44.116
Sorry. No, actually...
- Are you okay?

190
00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:45.558
- It's nothing. Yeah.

191
00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.952
What were you saying?
- What happened?

192
00:12:46.976 --> 00:12:50.021
- It's really... it's just
a little scratch.

193
00:12:51.147 --> 00:12:52.648
That's not a scratch.

194
00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:55.318
- It was just
the freaking tool cart.

195
00:12:55.359 --> 00:12:56.628
- Look, you need
some antibiotics.

196
00:12:56.652 --> 00:12:58.696
- No, we only have
one course left.

197
00:12:58.738 --> 00:13:01.115
I am not using it
on this little cut.

198
00:13:01.157 --> 00:13:02.909
- Well, what if
the infection spreads?

199
00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:04.660
- People don't die
from little cuts.

200
00:13:04.702 --> 00:13:06.204
- Yeah, because
they use antibiotics.

201
00:13:06.245 --> 00:13:07.747
- It's fine.

202
00:13:15.546 --> 00:13:17.465
- So you were saying?

203
00:13:17.507 --> 00:13:18.966
- What?

204
00:13:19.008 --> 00:13:22.303
- You were saying why we
shouldn't do sex on each other.

205
00:13:24.055 --> 00:13:30.311
- Well, number one,
I'm not attracted to you.

206
00:13:32.522 --> 00:13:35.483
That's an argument for,
not against.

207
00:13:35.525 --> 00:13:36.818
- How?

208
00:13:36.859 --> 00:13:38.778
- Because if we were
attracted to each other,

209
00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:41.864
then "banging" could possibly
turn into something

210
00:13:41.906 --> 00:13:42.949
and it would get messy.

211
00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:44.242
- Super messy.
- Right.

212
00:13:44.283 --> 00:13:45.993
So the fact that you're
not attracted to me

213
00:13:46.035 --> 00:13:48.204
is a benefit because
we don't have to worry

214
00:13:48.246 --> 00:13:49.705
about getting messy.

215
00:13:49.747 --> 00:13:50.915
Quick pinch.

216
00:13:54.585 --> 00:13:56.546
So wait.

217
00:13:56.587 --> 00:13:59.215
You are not attracted
to me, either?

218
00:13:59.257 --> 00:14:00.842
- Absolutely not.

219
00:14:02.218 --> 00:14:03.928
- Okay.

220
00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:05.513
- Do you want me to be?
- No.

221
00:14:05.555 --> 00:14:08.224
Obviously, not.

222
00:14:08.266 --> 00:14:10.518
I'm just surprised
this is the first time

223
00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.646
us "banging"
has occurred to you.

224
00:14:13.688 --> 00:14:16.899
- I didn't say that.

225
00:14:16.941 --> 00:14:19.026
You've never thought about it?

226
00:14:19.068 --> 00:14:23.239
- I mean, you have the only
penis for a million miles.

227
00:14:23.281 --> 00:14:25.366
- See?

228
00:14:25.408 --> 00:14:27.326
There you go.

229
00:14:28.786 --> 00:14:32.832
So let's keep this
dry and clean.

230
00:14:32.874 --> 00:14:37.670
And if it starts to hurt,
you let me know ASAP.

231
00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:40.673
Okay?

232
00:14:40.715 --> 00:14:41.883
- Yep.

233
00:14:44.302 --> 00:14:48.514
So was this a debate, or are
you making a formal proposal?

234
00:14:48.556 --> 00:14:51.434
It's a debate.

235
00:14:52.518 --> 00:14:53.728
- Unless I'm convincing you,

236
00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:55.229
then we definitely should do it.

237
00:14:57.565 --> 00:14:59.067
- My point still stands.

238
00:14:59.108 --> 00:15:00.026
- How so?

239
00:15:00.068 --> 00:15:02.361
- Well, we're not attracted now,

240
00:15:02.403 --> 00:15:03.696
but if we started having sex,

241
00:15:03.738 --> 00:15:07.075
even if we just said
it was "banging,"

242
00:15:07.116 --> 00:15:09.911
our hormones
would eventually take over

243
00:15:09.952 --> 00:15:11.245
and we would emotionally attach.

244
00:15:11.287 --> 00:15:14.415
- And when you say attach,
you mean fall in love?

245
00:15:14.457 --> 00:15:16.125
- Sure.

246
00:15:16.167 --> 00:15:18.711
That's the whole reason why
arranged marriages work.

247
00:15:18.753 --> 00:15:20.421
Maybe you think
the other person's gross

248
00:15:20.463 --> 00:15:22.924
when you meet them, but your
brain knows you're stuck.

249
00:15:22.965 --> 00:15:24.425
Biology takes over.

250
00:15:24.467 --> 00:15:26.010
- You're such a romantic.

251
00:15:26.052 --> 00:15:27.762
- Dude, it's science.
You are a scientist.

252
00:15:27.804 --> 00:15:29.889
- Yeah, and as a scientist,
I can point out

253
00:15:29.931 --> 00:15:32.392
all sorts
of evolutionary benefits

254
00:15:32.433 --> 00:15:34.185
to emotional connection.

255
00:15:34.227 --> 00:15:37.355
But that doesn't mean I think
love is a chemical reaction.

256
00:15:37.397 --> 00:15:39.524
No, not at all.

257
00:15:39.565 --> 00:15:41.109
People are meant to be together.

258
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:43.986
And it has nothing to do with
scent or a primal instinct

259
00:15:44.028 --> 00:15:49.075
or unavoidable circumstances,
it's just...

260
00:15:49.117 --> 00:15:53.329
I don't know, they just, like,
belong together, you know?

261
00:15:55.248 --> 00:15:57.417
- Sorry.
- Is this... is this on?

262
00:15:57.458 --> 00:15:58.626
Okay.

263
00:15:58.668 --> 00:16:00.128
Lame.

264
00:16:00.169 --> 00:16:01.254
Can I get a lame?

265
00:16:01.295 --> 00:16:04.716
Yes, because we are
all just robots.

266
00:16:04.757 --> 00:16:06.443
- Yeah, and by your logic,
it doesn't matter

267
00:16:06.467 --> 00:16:10.304
if we have sex or not,
because we're emotionally

268
00:16:10.346 --> 00:16:13.766
attached anyhow, because our
monkey brains will tell us

269
00:16:13.808 --> 00:16:15.476
that's our best chance
at survival.

270
00:16:15.518 --> 00:16:19.063
- Or one of us kills
the other to gain full control

271
00:16:19.105 --> 00:16:21.441
over our limited resources.

272
00:16:24.736 --> 00:16:26.362
- What's number two?

273
00:16:26.404 --> 00:16:28.656
- Reason number two.

274
00:16:28.698 --> 00:16:30.074
We're both married.

275
00:16:34.954 --> 00:16:37.039
- Like I was saying, I don't
see what the problem is.

276
00:16:37.081 --> 00:16:39.250
- You don't think the fact
that we're both married

277
00:16:39.292 --> 00:16:41.294
should have an impact
on whether we sleep together?

278
00:16:41.335 --> 00:16:42.837
- I mean, granted,
I haven't read

279
00:16:42.879 --> 00:16:44.297
my marriage license in a while,

280
00:16:44.338 --> 00:16:46.966
but I'm sure
being adrift in space

281
00:16:47.008 --> 00:16:49.510
with no hope of rescue
gives you a hall pass.

282
00:16:49.552 --> 00:16:53.389
- Okay, first of all, there's
not no possibility of rescue.

283
00:16:53.431 --> 00:16:57.018
- We literally talked
about this yesterday.

284
00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:59.687
- That was two weeks ago.

285
00:16:59.729 --> 00:17:01.773
- Really?
- Yeah.

286
00:17:01.814 --> 00:17:03.816
- Man, time out here is whacked.

287
00:17:03.858 --> 00:17:06.360
- Look, maybe we don't
get saved,

288
00:17:06.402 --> 00:17:08.988
but I, for one,
still think we can fix this.

289
00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:11.282
How's that working out for you?

290
00:17:11.324 --> 00:17:12.825
- You know,
I'm so glad you asked,

291
00:17:12.867 --> 00:17:15.411
because it would be better
if someone helped.

292
00:17:15.453 --> 00:17:17.580
- There are hundreds
of wires over there.

293
00:17:17.622 --> 00:17:20.583
That means there's billions
of possible combinations.

294
00:17:20.625 --> 00:17:23.503
It's a waste of time.

295
00:17:23.544 --> 00:17:26.214
- What else
am I supposed to be doing?

296
00:17:28.674 --> 00:17:30.718
Okay. You have a hall pass.

297
00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.261
I don't want one.

298
00:17:32.303 --> 00:17:35.223
- What, because your brain
chemically reacts with Todd's?

299
00:17:35.264 --> 00:17:37.934
Tom and I have been
together since college

300
00:17:37.975 --> 00:17:39.894
and we are very committed
to each other.

301
00:17:39.936 --> 00:17:43.940
- And how much of that time did
you spend deployed or in space?

302
00:17:43.981 --> 00:17:46.984
- What has that got to do
with anything?

303
00:17:47.026 --> 00:17:48.569
I had a job to do.

304
00:17:48.611 --> 00:17:50.780
- Okay. All right. Sorry.

305
00:17:53.199 --> 00:17:56.828
- And are you seriously going
to claim to love Atlanta...

306
00:17:56.869 --> 00:17:58.079
- Savannah.

307
00:17:58.121 --> 00:17:59.705
- More than I love Tom,
while you are

308
00:17:59.747 --> 00:18:01.374
begging me to cheat with you?

309
00:18:01.416 --> 00:18:03.501
- I'm not begging you
to do anything.

310
00:18:03.543 --> 00:18:05.878
This is a debate between
friends to pass time.

311
00:18:12.927 --> 00:18:14.095
Okay, flip them.

312
00:18:14.137 --> 00:18:16.764
- Both?
- Yep.

313
00:18:16.806 --> 00:18:19.892
All right.

314
00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:25.815
Testing navigation.

315
00:18:25.857 --> 00:18:28.401
- Error. Navigation failed.

316
00:18:28.443 --> 00:18:29.443
- Test fail.

317
00:18:33.322 --> 00:18:35.783
Testing comms.

318
00:18:35.825 --> 00:18:37.285
- Error.

319
00:18:37.326 --> 00:18:40.246
Please contact your nearest
NASA representative.

320
00:18:40.288 --> 00:18:41.914
- Test fail.

321
00:18:46.127 --> 00:18:49.464
Why didn't they just label
these goddamn wires?

322
00:18:51.883 --> 00:18:54.052
- How's your cut doing?
- It's fine.

323
00:18:56.929 --> 00:18:58.489
- You know what
you wanna watch tonight?

324
00:18:59.724 --> 00:19:02.268
- I don't know.
Something upbeat?

325
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:04.353
"Princess Bride"?

326
00:19:04.395 --> 00:19:05.813
What?

327
00:19:05.855 --> 00:19:06.999
- I've watched it, like,
a thousand times.

328
00:19:07.023 --> 00:19:09.150
- Well, let's watch it 1,001.
It works.

329
00:19:09.192 --> 00:19:11.736
- Plus you always spend
the whole next day all...

330
00:19:11.778 --> 00:19:14.447
- Hello.
My name is Inigo Montoya.

331
00:19:14.489 --> 00:19:18.743
You killed my father.
Prepare to die.

332
00:19:20.328 --> 00:19:22.538
I'm really not seeing
the problem here.

333
00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:26.584
- Can we please just try
something different?

334
00:19:26.626 --> 00:19:29.754
I have, like, ten movies
we haven't watched at all yet.

335
00:19:29.796 --> 00:19:31.005
- Okay, all right. Okay.

336
00:19:31.047 --> 00:19:33.925
- Great. Thank you.

337
00:19:36.469 --> 00:19:39.430
Ooh, "Alien"?

338
00:19:39.472 --> 00:19:40.890
- Never seen it.

339
00:19:42.767 --> 00:19:44.018
- You have never seen "Alien"?

340
00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:45.561
- I've never seen it, no.

341
00:19:45.603 --> 00:19:52.110
- Bro, you are in
for a serious treat.

342
00:19:52.151 --> 00:19:53.736
My God.

343
00:19:53.778 --> 00:19:55.530
- Sweet. Okay.

344
00:20:01.911 --> 00:20:03.246
Sigourney Weaver.

345
00:20:03.287 --> 00:20:04.539
I know.

346
00:20:13.506 --> 00:20:16.008
Why the hell
did we watch that movie?

347
00:20:21.472 --> 00:20:23.349
Can you walk me to the bathroom?

348
00:20:24.726 --> 00:20:26.436
- Yeah. Okay, sure.

349
00:20:38.364 --> 00:20:39.741
- Hey.

350
00:20:39.782 --> 00:20:41.534
- Ha?

351
00:20:41.576 --> 00:20:43.494
- What are you doing?

352
00:20:43.536 --> 00:20:46.622
- Sleeping.
- You didn't hear me call you?

353
00:20:46.664 --> 00:20:49.000
I'm scared.

354
00:20:49.041 --> 00:20:51.919
And I don't think
the girls can protect me,

355
00:20:51.961 --> 00:20:55.048
so I think I'ma just
sleep in here?

356
00:20:55.089 --> 00:20:57.508
- Whatever. Just stop talking.

357
00:20:57.550 --> 00:20:59.010
- Okay.

358
00:21:04.766 --> 00:21:06.642
Use this.

359
00:21:06.684 --> 00:21:11.272
Make a wall, your side.

360
00:21:11.314 --> 00:21:13.066
Not doing anything.

361
00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:25.495
- Good morning, Jane.

362
00:21:25.536 --> 00:21:28.539
It's day 1,022.

363
00:21:44.972 --> 00:21:47.100
- Hi.

364
00:21:47.141 --> 00:21:49.727
- Hi.

365
00:21:49.769 --> 00:21:52.188
- So those squishy
round thingamabobs

366
00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:54.148
that were pressed
against my chest, I guess...

367
00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:56.150
- Yeah, yep, my boobs.

368
00:21:58.194 --> 00:22:01.906
- Um, when you came in,
I may have forgotten

369
00:22:01.948 --> 00:22:05.660
my general lack of clothing.

370
00:22:05.701 --> 00:22:06.701
- Yeah.

371
00:22:11.082 --> 00:22:14.877
- Are you feeling better after...

372
00:22:14.919 --> 00:22:17.505
Stop it.

373
00:22:17.547 --> 00:22:19.799
I'm fine.

374
00:22:19.841 --> 00:22:21.134
- Well...

375
00:22:26.305 --> 00:22:28.891
Get out of here.
- Right. Thanks.

376
00:22:30.059 --> 00:22:32.353
Chickies, Gertie.

377
00:22:46.659 --> 00:22:48.703
All right. Now sit.

378
00:22:48.745 --> 00:22:49.745
Sit.

379
00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:04.719
One, two, go get!

380
00:23:06.137 --> 00:23:07.138
Come on.

381
00:23:21.611 --> 00:23:23.821
- So I've been thinking
about the other morning.

382
00:23:23.863 --> 00:23:26.866
- How you squished
your boobs against me.

383
00:23:26.908 --> 00:23:29.035
- Yeah.
- Okay.

384
00:23:29.077 --> 00:23:31.662
- It was pretty great, right?

385
00:23:31.704 --> 00:23:32.663
- Okay.

386
00:23:32.705 --> 00:23:33.766
Come on, let me
look at your leg.

387
00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:34.832
Come on.

388
00:23:37.043 --> 00:23:38.669
Look at that.
- Told you.

389
00:23:38.711 --> 00:23:39.962
- Yeah.

390
00:23:40.004 --> 00:23:42.340
It's 'cause of my mad
hydrogen peroxide skills.

391
00:23:42.382 --> 00:23:45.218
- So, like, from a mental
health perspective,

392
00:23:45.259 --> 00:23:48.388
skin on skin contact
is crazy good for you.

393
00:23:48.429 --> 00:23:51.140
Increased serotonin
and dopamine and oxytocin,

394
00:23:51.182 --> 00:23:53.142
lowered blood pressure.

395
00:23:53.184 --> 00:23:55.311
- Is this your
excessively clinical way

396
00:23:55.353 --> 00:23:58.022
of telling me you wanna
naked cuddle more?

397
00:23:58.064 --> 00:24:00.525
Well, I mean...

398
00:24:00.566 --> 00:24:01.901
What are your thoughts?

399
00:24:01.943 --> 00:24:04.487
- Well, I'm just surprised
that you're so willing

400
00:24:04.529 --> 00:24:06.364
to cede the moral high ground.

401
00:24:06.406 --> 00:24:09.534
- Moral high ground?
It's a mental health issue.

402
00:24:09.575 --> 00:24:13.162
- For you, but it's
a stress relief issue for me.

403
00:24:13.204 --> 00:24:16.541
So if we get
to cuddle naked, then I...

404
00:24:16.582 --> 00:24:20.002
- So, like, cuddling is on the
same sliding scale as banging?

405
00:24:20.044 --> 00:24:21.295
- I'm glad you agree.

406
00:24:21.337 --> 00:24:22.630
- So we shouldn't do either?

407
00:24:22.672 --> 00:24:25.633
- That's not where
I expected that to go.

408
00:24:25.675 --> 00:24:26.675
- Sorry.

409
00:24:28.261 --> 00:24:29.762
- Shall we?

410
00:26:01.145 --> 00:26:04.107
We haven't discussed
reason number three.

411
00:26:04.148 --> 00:26:05.900
- What's three?

412
00:26:05.942 --> 00:26:07.318
- You could knock me up.

413
00:26:12.407 --> 00:26:14.242
- So you don't have
birth control?

414
00:26:14.283 --> 00:26:18.121
- Well, I had an IUD, but it
was giving me weird cramps,

415
00:26:18.162 --> 00:26:21.374
so Benson removed it from me

416
00:26:21.416 --> 00:26:23.167
before the, you know...

417
00:26:23.209 --> 00:26:26.003
- The crazy.
- Yeah.

418
00:26:26.045 --> 00:26:28.923
There's no condoms
or Plan B in Medical?

419
00:26:28.965 --> 00:26:31.342
- Amazingly,
the government didn't send

420
00:26:31.384 --> 00:26:33.553
three married astronauts
into space

421
00:26:33.594 --> 00:26:35.888
with a supply of condoms.

422
00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:37.348
- Bad planning.

423
00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:41.936
- No, it's like the gray wire
situation all over again.

424
00:26:41.978 --> 00:26:42.978
- Totally.

425
00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:49.652
Let's just say, like,
for argument's sake,

426
00:26:49.694 --> 00:26:52.363
you did get knocked up,

427
00:26:52.405 --> 00:26:54.615
would it be that bad?

428
00:26:54.657 --> 00:26:56.451
I said for argument's sake.

429
00:26:58.828 --> 00:27:03.166
- You want to raise a child
adrift in space?

430
00:27:03.207 --> 00:27:05.501
- It's beautiful out here.

431
00:27:05.543 --> 00:27:07.795
All of our life support
and food sources

432
00:27:07.837 --> 00:27:10.882
are self-sustainable.
We have movies.

433
00:27:10.923 --> 00:27:13.634
What kid doesn't like space?

434
00:27:13.676 --> 00:27:15.845
- So you're losing your mind.

435
00:27:18.681 --> 00:27:23.728
- I didn't wanna say it,
but it should be mentioned.

436
00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:25.748
As long as we've been out here
with all the radiation,

437
00:27:25.772 --> 00:27:27.982
you're probably sterile anyway.

438
00:27:31.819 --> 00:27:34.113
What?

439
00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:39.660
You're such a jerk.

440
00:27:39.702 --> 00:27:41.829
- I told you
I didn't wanna say it!

441
00:27:41.871 --> 00:27:44.457
I mean, can you believe it?

442
00:27:44.499 --> 00:27:46.459
All the man can
think about is sex.

443
00:27:46.501 --> 00:27:49.170
And before you say anything,
yes, obviously,

444
00:27:49.212 --> 00:27:51.005
I think about it too.

445
00:27:51.047 --> 00:27:53.883
Did I turn four different
electric drills into vibrators?

446
00:27:57.428 --> 00:27:59.347
That was more about innovation.

447
00:28:04.185 --> 00:28:07.188
You've gotta be
rational about it, you know?

448
00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:11.526
He's like my big brother
and my little sister.

449
00:28:11.567 --> 00:28:13.820
Yo, and he's kind
of like my dog.

450
00:28:15.154 --> 00:28:16.632
Am I really supposed to believe

451
00:28:16.656 --> 00:28:18.533
that he's not into this?

452
00:28:18.574 --> 00:28:20.493
Really? Come on.

453
00:28:20.535 --> 00:28:24.247
- And all these quote, unquote,
"reasons" she's throwing out

454
00:28:24.288 --> 00:28:27.041
is complete BS.

455
00:28:27.083 --> 00:28:28.835
And even if we did make it home,

456
00:28:28.876 --> 00:28:31.796
which we're not, by the way...

457
00:28:33.923 --> 00:28:36.801
There's no way Savannah
wouldn't understand that.

458
00:28:40.096 --> 00:28:42.640
Yeah, I think
about it every day.

459
00:28:42.682 --> 00:28:44.183
- Work is good.

460
00:28:44.225 --> 00:28:46.102
Not to brag,
but I am kind of rocking

461
00:28:46.144 --> 00:28:47.520
this whole mayor thing.

462
00:28:47.562 --> 00:28:49.248
I got the funding for the
universal lunch program,

463
00:28:49.272 --> 00:28:51.441
so yay.

464
00:28:54.193 --> 00:28:57.697
I don't like that
I'm living without you,

465
00:28:57.739 --> 00:28:59.073
but I'm proud of you.

466
00:28:59.115 --> 00:29:01.159
I'm proud of you,
and I'm proud of me.

467
00:29:03.286 --> 00:29:05.830
And I may have killed
that fern in the kitchen,

468
00:29:05.872 --> 00:29:08.416
so you should probably get back

469
00:29:08.458 --> 00:29:09.667
because you're the only one

470
00:29:09.709 --> 00:29:12.295
with the green thumb
around here.

471
00:29:12.336 --> 00:29:14.130
Even the plants miss you.

472
00:29:16.758 --> 00:29:19.886
- I'd be devastated
if she waited for me.

473
00:29:21.971 --> 00:29:24.140
She deserves better than that.

474
00:29:29.145 --> 00:29:32.148
- Hi.
Hey, how's it going up there?

475
00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:35.568
Are you going nuts
on that tiny little shuttle?

476
00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:37.111
So many questions.

477
00:29:37.153 --> 00:29:39.655
Tom would love it up here.

478
00:29:39.697 --> 00:29:41.199
Are you kidding me?

479
00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:44.077
Sitting around watching
movies every night,

480
00:29:44.118 --> 00:29:46.204
it's like his heaven.

481
00:29:46.245 --> 00:29:50.958
I was always like,
let's go for a hike,

482
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.337
let's try a new restaurant
or take a road trip.

483
00:29:54.379 --> 00:29:58.216
- I did screw up
the universal remote again,

484
00:29:58.257 --> 00:30:01.594
and now the sound
of the TV doesn't work.

485
00:30:01.636 --> 00:30:03.137
That's gonna have to wait.

486
00:30:03.179 --> 00:30:04.889
- I think he was hoping
this mission

487
00:30:04.931 --> 00:30:06.974
would be, like,
my ultimate adventure,

488
00:30:07.016 --> 00:30:12.522
and then I would come home
and finally be able to just...

489
00:30:14.315 --> 00:30:15.858
Be.

490
00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:18.986
- All right, I love you,
and I can't wait to see you.

491
00:30:19.028 --> 00:30:21.280
Have a blast.

492
00:30:21.322 --> 00:30:24.075
- End of message.

493
00:30:24.117 --> 00:30:26.869
- Hi.
How's it going up there?

494
00:30:26.911 --> 00:30:29.497
Are you going nuts
on that tiny little shuttle?

495
00:30:34.752 --> 00:30:36.671
- My very last Pop-Tart.

496
00:30:55.314 --> 00:30:59.110
We add that to the list
of things I'll never do again.

497
00:31:07.243 --> 00:31:10.872
If he could see me now...

498
00:31:18.254 --> 00:31:19.254
Shut up.

499
00:31:21.215 --> 00:31:22.800
I need some music.

500
00:31:57.585 --> 00:31:59.170
- No.

501
00:32:12.475 --> 00:32:13.643
Adam!

502
00:32:13.684 --> 00:32:16.437
- You hurt yourself?
- Um...

503
00:32:16.479 --> 00:32:17.605
it's just so weird.

504
00:32:17.647 --> 00:32:22.068
I can't... my music's not working.

505
00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:23.110
- Let me see it.

506
00:32:32.662 --> 00:32:34.330
I tried that.

507
00:32:40.169 --> 00:32:41.462
No.

508
00:32:41.504 --> 00:32:42.797
Don't say that. What?

509
00:32:44.674 --> 00:32:48.928
- It says the root file
for your music is corrupted.

510
00:32:48.970 --> 00:32:50.263
- Okay, well, fix it.

511
00:32:50.304 --> 00:32:53.349
- Well, that was... I mean...
- Fix it.

512
00:32:53.391 --> 00:32:54.391
Okay.

513
00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:00.648
I'm so sorry.

514
00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:01.941
- No, no. Come on.

515
00:33:01.983 --> 00:33:03.192
- I don't think I can do this.

516
00:33:03.234 --> 00:33:06.320
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

517
00:33:06.362 --> 00:33:09.407
- I still have my music, right?
You like Sinatra, right?

518
00:33:09.449 --> 00:33:10.700
Garth Brooks?

519
00:33:10.742 --> 00:33:13.619
No, I can't
listen to your music.

520
00:33:13.661 --> 00:33:15.872
- Your music sucks!
- No.

521
00:33:15.913 --> 00:33:17.665
I mean,
you like Kenny Rogers, right?

522
00:33:17.707 --> 00:33:19.333
- What?
- You like Eminem?

523
00:33:19.375 --> 00:33:22.336
Who's your favorite singer?

524
00:33:22.378 --> 00:33:23.880
- Um.

525
00:33:23.921 --> 00:33:25.214
Lionel Richie.

526
00:33:25.256 --> 00:33:26.900
- Lionel Richie.
Good, good, good, good, good.

527
00:33:26.924 --> 00:33:29.135
What's your favorite
Lionel Richie song?

528
00:33:29.177 --> 00:33:32.346
- "All Night Long."
- "All Night Long," okay.

529
00:33:32.388 --> 00:33:33.388
Here we go.

530
00:33:36.684 --> 00:33:38.561
Whoa.

531
00:33:38.603 --> 00:33:39.603
- Doesn't work.

532
00:33:54.202 --> 00:33:55.369
Come on.

533
00:34:10.426 --> 00:34:13.304
- Fiesta forever.

534
00:34:34.242 --> 00:34:35.535
- Yeah!

535
00:34:42.959 --> 00:34:45.086
- My name is Inigo Montoya.

536
00:34:45.128 --> 00:34:47.046
You killed my father.

537
00:34:47.088 --> 00:34:50.425
Prepare to die.

538
00:35:03.771 --> 00:35:05.523
- You wanna hang?

539
00:35:10.486 --> 00:35:11.612
Hey!

540
00:35:13.489 --> 00:35:15.450
- You flinched
and you're cheating.

541
00:35:25.877 --> 00:35:28.546
- This might be
your best work yet.

542
00:35:28.588 --> 00:35:30.089
- Thank you.

543
00:35:30.131 --> 00:35:32.091
- You know what you want?

544
00:35:32.133 --> 00:35:33.342
I don't know.

545
00:35:33.384 --> 00:35:38.139
Just something cool right here.

546
00:35:38.181 --> 00:35:40.683
Who's your favorite, me or Adam?

547
00:35:40.725 --> 00:35:43.519
I know what's the answer.

548
00:35:43.561 --> 00:35:45.063
And I won't tell him.

549
00:35:45.104 --> 00:35:46.522
Okay, I won't tell him.

550
00:35:46.564 --> 00:35:48.066
Are you juggling our eggs?

551
00:35:48.107 --> 00:35:50.902
Feed the input
and output for me, please.

552
00:35:52.361 --> 00:35:54.489
- Input.

553
00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:57.658
000.

554
00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:00.286
- Okay.
- 010.

555
00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:03.998
100.

556
00:36:21.182 --> 00:36:23.059
It's gonna flower soon.

557
00:36:23.101 --> 00:36:24.602
I can feel it.

558
00:36:24.644 --> 00:36:26.104
- I believe you.

559
00:36:26.145 --> 00:36:30.233
- And we can get high off
these amazingly juicy berries.

560
00:36:30.274 --> 00:36:34.070
And when I get back to Earth,
I'll be a billionaire.

561
00:36:36.989 --> 00:36:38.658
- Well, you'll still
have to cook it.

562
00:36:42.370 --> 00:36:44.372
- What?

563
00:36:44.414 --> 00:36:50.378
- THC and weed needs to be
heated in order to activate.

564
00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:52.672
So you're gonna have to,
you know, like,

565
00:36:52.714 --> 00:36:54.966
bake it or smoke it.

566
00:36:55.007 --> 00:36:59.721
Like, you can't just eat one
of these weeds and get stoned.

567
00:36:59.762 --> 00:37:01.723
But you know, maybe I'm wrong.

568
00:37:01.764 --> 00:37:06.686
Maybe you made the first
raw plant ever to get you high.

569
00:37:06.728 --> 00:37:08.604
Hey, it's still gonna be great.

570
00:37:10.565 --> 00:37:11.983
Don't look. Don't look.
Don't look.

571
00:37:12.024 --> 00:37:13.109
- What is it?

572
00:37:14.944 --> 00:37:17.029
- Dude, are you ready for this?

573
00:37:17.071 --> 00:37:18.239
- Yes, what is it?

574
00:37:18.281 --> 00:37:21.200
- No peeking!
- Jeez!

575
00:37:21.242 --> 00:37:23.327
- Okay, it's probably thicker
than the real thing

576
00:37:23.369 --> 00:37:26.205
and not as dry and crumbly,
but what do you think?

577
00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:32.754
- Are you serious?

578
00:37:32.795 --> 00:37:34.297
- Yeah.

579
00:37:36.924 --> 00:37:38.634
Here.

580
00:38:00.531 --> 00:38:04.619
- You know what,
country music is not that bad.

581
00:38:08.831 --> 00:38:09.999
What?

582
00:38:20.843 --> 00:38:22.595
We should get her out of here.

583
00:38:25.181 --> 00:38:27.183
I don't want
the girls to see her.

584
00:38:40.863 --> 00:38:41.989
- Do we have to?

585
00:38:42.031 --> 00:38:43.908
- It would be crazy not to.

586
00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:45.660
- But we didn't eat Benson.

587
00:38:49.163 --> 00:38:51.165
- Benson was a person.

588
00:38:51.207 --> 00:38:53.209
Gertie was here
for food purposes.

589
00:38:53.251 --> 00:38:56.170
- For milk purposes.

590
00:38:56.212 --> 00:38:57.755
How much
do we have left, anyway?

591
00:38:57.797 --> 00:39:01.926
- I think we only have, like,
12 pints left in the freezer.

592
00:39:01.968 --> 00:39:07.348
But now we also have
50-plus meals worth of meat.

593
00:39:09.851 --> 00:39:11.102
Together.

594
00:39:23.448 --> 00:39:24.449
- One.

595
00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:25.283
- Two.

596
00:39:25.324 --> 00:39:26.409
Three.

597
00:39:35.418 --> 00:39:38.212
- That's so good.
- My God.

598
00:39:38.254 --> 00:39:40.048
Mama mia.

599
00:39:40.089 --> 00:39:42.050
Zut alors.

600
00:39:42.091 --> 00:39:43.384
- Come on.

601
00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:21.172
I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

602
00:40:21.214 --> 00:40:22.590
It was a mistake.

603
00:40:24.634 --> 00:40:26.511
- Yeah, but what if
you have a mistake?

604
00:40:26.552 --> 00:40:27.553
- I won't.

605
00:40:48.825 --> 00:40:49.951
Thank you.

606
00:40:49.992 --> 00:40:51.160
- You're welcome.

607
00:41:00.712 --> 00:41:04.298
- You haven't asked
to bang in while.

608
00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:07.301
- Well, technically,
I never asked.

609
00:41:07.343 --> 00:41:08.803
It was more of a debate.

610
00:41:08.845 --> 00:41:11.973
Yeah. Okay.

611
00:41:12.014 --> 00:41:15.268
So for the sake of debate,

612
00:41:15.309 --> 00:41:19.021
what would
your theoretical stance

613
00:41:19.063 --> 00:41:25.069
be on everything but?

614
00:41:25.111 --> 00:41:26.654
- You mean, like, hand stuff?

615
00:41:26.696 --> 00:41:28.781
- Yeah.

616
00:41:28.823 --> 00:41:30.158
- And mouth stuff?

617
00:41:30.199 --> 00:41:32.785
- Everything but.

618
00:41:32.827 --> 00:41:37.457
That you could, you know,
hypothetically think of.

619
00:41:37.498 --> 00:41:40.501
- Well, hypothetically,

620
00:41:40.543 --> 00:41:43.379
I'd wanna make sure
you were sure.

621
00:41:43.421 --> 00:41:47.425
- I mean, I still have
my husband,

622
00:41:47.467 --> 00:41:52.180
but he's still
a billion miles away.

623
00:41:52.221 --> 00:41:54.515
And it's just a matter
of time before something vital

624
00:41:54.557 --> 00:41:57.477
on the ship breaks
that we can't fix.

625
00:41:57.518 --> 00:42:00.104
Plus, you are hot.

626
00:42:01.522 --> 00:42:03.483
- And I've have seen
the outline of your penis

627
00:42:03.524 --> 00:42:04.942
when you wear gym shorts,

628
00:42:04.984 --> 00:42:08.404
and I feel like
it wouldn't disappoint.

629
00:42:08.446 --> 00:42:10.406
- Wow, we're being honest today.

630
00:42:10.448 --> 00:42:13.701
- But it isn't just me, right?

631
00:42:13.743 --> 00:42:18.915
Like, you are
attracted to me too?

632
00:42:20.792 --> 00:42:21.751
- Theoretically?

633
00:42:21.793 --> 00:42:24.921
- No, do you find me attractive?

634
00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:29.258
- Yeah. Very.

635
00:42:31.386 --> 00:42:35.223
- Okay.
- Okay.

636
00:42:35.264 --> 00:42:36.974
- Yeah, okay.

637
00:42:40.770 --> 00:42:43.022
- So did you just go
from pretty sure to sure?

638
00:42:43.064 --> 00:42:45.775
- There is one other thing.

639
00:42:45.817 --> 00:42:47.735
- What's that?

640
00:42:47.777 --> 00:42:50.071
- Okay, so I'm not saying
this romantically,

641
00:42:50.113 --> 00:42:51.989
so please don't get it twisted.

642
00:42:52.031 --> 00:42:53.324
Boy.

643
00:42:53.366 --> 00:42:58.955
- But you are literally
my entire world.

644
00:42:58.996 --> 00:43:00.373
Shut up.

645
00:43:00.415 --> 00:43:04.919
You are my only friend.

646
00:43:04.961 --> 00:43:07.630
You're my only coworker.

647
00:43:07.672 --> 00:43:10.049
You are the only person
who can check

648
00:43:10.091 --> 00:43:13.761
that weird ass mole for me.

649
00:43:13.803 --> 00:43:17.849
So what if you're bad at sex?

650
00:43:21.477 --> 00:43:23.938
- I'm serious.

651
00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:26.190
Like, what if we do it
and you can't find my clit

652
00:43:26.232 --> 00:43:29.444
and you're, like, one of
those sweaty, dripping dudes

653
00:43:29.485 --> 00:43:31.070
who always has to be on top,

654
00:43:31.112 --> 00:43:33.132
and then I have to call it off,
and then things get weird,

655
00:43:33.156 --> 00:43:38.661
and this awesome thing
we have going on gets ruined.

656
00:43:38.703 --> 00:43:43.499
Okay. All right. Stop. Stop.

657
00:43:43.541 --> 00:43:48.379
First of all,
I love the clit, okay?

658
00:43:48.421 --> 00:43:50.339
We're best friends.

659
00:43:50.381 --> 00:43:53.468
Second of all...

660
00:43:53.509 --> 00:43:56.345
we're still just talking
about banging, right?

661
00:43:58.639 --> 00:44:00.558
- Yeah, right.
- Okay.

662
00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:05.980
So if one of us wants
to stop, we just stop.

663
00:44:06.022 --> 00:44:07.607
No hard feelings.

664
00:44:07.648 --> 00:44:09.442
No explanations needed.

665
00:44:09.484 --> 00:44:12.153
None asked for.

666
00:44:12.195 --> 00:44:15.114
- Yeah?
- Totally.

667
00:44:15.156 --> 00:44:16.574
- Promise?

668
00:44:17.992 --> 00:44:23.498
- I promise on my
delicious dead goat.

669
00:44:23.539 --> 00:44:25.750
- Our delicious dead goat.

670
00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:28.960
Okay.

671
00:44:31.923 --> 00:44:32.923
- Okay.

672
00:44:38.221 --> 00:44:39.680
So what did we just decide?

673
00:44:39.722 --> 00:44:43.518
- I think we just decided
to try everything but.

674
00:44:43.559 --> 00:44:45.103
Wow.

675
00:44:45.144 --> 00:44:47.313
Just... okay.

676
00:44:47.355 --> 00:44:49.399
So, right now?

677
00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:50.566
- I guess.

678
00:44:53.653 --> 00:44:54.862
Actually, you know what?

679
00:44:54.904 --> 00:44:56.382
I haven't done any
personal maintenance

680
00:44:56.406 --> 00:44:57.865
in, like, a really long time.

681
00:44:57.907 --> 00:44:59.909
Do you think we could
do it tomorrow night?

682
00:45:01.494 --> 00:45:03.538
- I'll check my calendar.

683
00:45:03.579 --> 00:45:05.248
- Cool.
- Dope.

684
00:45:05.289 --> 00:45:06.916
- Sick.
- Looking forward to it.

685
00:45:06.958 --> 00:45:08.584
- It's a date.

686
00:45:08.626 --> 00:45:11.337
- Be there or be square.

687
00:45:11.379 --> 00:45:12.964
- Coolio.

688
00:45:13.005 --> 00:45:14.048
- Slamming.

689
00:45:19.721 --> 00:45:21.139
- Good morning, Jane.

690
00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:22.890
It's day 1,051.

691
00:45:33.693 --> 00:45:35.528
Whoa.

692
00:45:35.570 --> 00:45:38.364
- Lieutenant.
- Captain.

693
00:45:43.786 --> 00:45:47.707
- Okay, what about this?

694
00:45:49.292 --> 00:45:50.292
- No.

695
00:45:53.546 --> 00:45:55.214
- No?

696
00:45:55.256 --> 00:45:56.257
- Nope.

697
00:45:56.299 --> 00:45:58.134
Are you sleepy? 'Cause I'm not.

698
00:45:58.176 --> 00:45:59.176
No.

699
00:46:03.723 --> 00:46:05.016
Yo, you look good tonight.

700
00:46:05.058 --> 00:46:06.059
No.

701
00:46:15.735 --> 00:46:18.488
- I'm still gonna try.

702
00:46:22.492 --> 00:46:25.119
- Comms fail.

703
00:46:25.161 --> 00:46:26.120
- Yo, Earth.

704
00:46:26.162 --> 00:46:27.705
We miss you, bruh.

705
00:46:32.835 --> 00:46:35.671
- Navigation engaged.

706
00:46:38.758 --> 00:46:40.301
My God.

707
00:46:46.099 --> 00:46:47.225
- Fuck.

708
00:46:49.394 --> 00:46:51.938
We have navigation.

709
00:46:51.979 --> 00:46:54.023
- Yeah.

710
00:46:54.065 --> 00:46:55.650
- But no comms.

711
00:46:58.027 --> 00:47:00.863
- We don't need comms
to get home.

712
00:47:00.905 --> 00:47:02.740
- So you can fly us home?

713
00:47:04.534 --> 00:47:05.868
- Yeah.

714
00:47:09.747 --> 00:47:11.582
- How long would it take?

715
00:47:16.170 --> 00:47:17.588
- Three weeks.

716
00:47:24.554 --> 00:47:26.514
- So I guess...

717
00:48:32.288 --> 00:48:33.664
- Are you okay?

718
00:48:33.706 --> 00:48:35.124
- What's this?

719
00:48:36.793 --> 00:48:39.253
Let me show you.

720
00:48:57.855 --> 00:48:59.440
My God!

721
00:49:22.213 --> 00:49:24.799
- I'm gonna have to get up
and pee in, like, 30 seconds.

722
00:49:24.841 --> 00:49:26.801
- Shh. Shh, shh.

723
00:49:37.729 --> 00:49:41.649
- If this gets infected
and I die before we get home,

724
00:49:41.691 --> 00:49:45.486
I'm gonna haunt you so hard.

725
00:49:45.528 --> 00:49:46.738
- Understandable.

726
00:49:50.199 --> 00:49:52.869
It's gonna be a hard one
to explain to the husband.

727
00:49:57.498 --> 00:50:01.919
- Yeah, well, we'll cross
that bridge when we get to it.

728
00:50:47.048 --> 00:50:48.716
It's weird, right?

729
00:50:48.758 --> 00:50:49.884
- Totally.

730
00:50:52.178 --> 00:50:56.974
Do you think there will be,
like, flying cars and stuff?

731
00:50:57.016 --> 00:50:59.477
- We've only been gone
for three years.

732
00:50:59.519 --> 00:51:02.021
Still.

733
00:51:02.063 --> 00:51:05.942
- I think it'll be
exactly the same.

734
00:51:05.983 --> 00:51:07.902
And completely different.

735
00:51:10.154 --> 00:51:12.573
- What are you
looking forward to most?

736
00:51:14.575 --> 00:51:16.911
Floating down Alcorn River.

737
00:51:16.953 --> 00:51:19.789
Having my music back.

738
00:51:19.831 --> 00:51:22.792
Never eating another egg for
the rest of my goddamn life.

739
00:51:22.834 --> 00:51:24.794
- Preach.
- You?

740
00:51:36.597 --> 00:51:39.183
I'm looking forward
to hugging Savannah.

741
00:51:40.893 --> 00:51:42.729
Can I say that?

742
00:51:42.770 --> 00:51:44.439
- Yeah, of course.

743
00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:45.565
She's your wife.

744
00:51:45.606 --> 00:51:46.607
- I know, but we're...

745
00:51:46.649 --> 00:51:49.444
- I can't wait to see Tom.

746
00:51:49.485 --> 00:51:51.779
I mean, he probably waited
a dignified three months

747
00:51:51.821 --> 00:51:54.615
before marrying
a nice, stable farm girl

748
00:51:54.657 --> 00:51:56.284
and filling her full of babies.

749
00:51:56.325 --> 00:51:58.327
You think?

750
00:52:02.999 --> 00:52:04.542
I don't know.

751
00:52:07.336 --> 00:52:11.382
It would just be nice
to get off this dumb rocket.

752
00:52:11.424 --> 00:52:13.092
Get back to life.

753
00:52:19.098 --> 00:52:21.350
- Can we still be
best friends when we get back?

754
00:52:23.227 --> 00:52:24.227
Please?

755
00:52:26.856 --> 00:52:30.943
Like you said, you've been my
entire world for three years.

756
00:52:34.572 --> 00:52:36.866
- Your world's about to get
a lot bigger.

757
00:54:13.629 --> 00:54:15.048
- Hey!

758
00:55:25.243 --> 00:55:26.577
- Goodbye.

759
00:56:15.543 --> 00:56:17.712
- The successful return
of Captain Kwan

760
00:56:17.754 --> 00:56:19.547
and lead science officer
Adam Gherrity

761
00:56:19.589 --> 00:56:22.717
is cause for celebration
the world over.

762
00:56:22.759 --> 00:56:25.636
And perhaps none will be more
elated than their spouses,

763
00:56:25.678 --> 00:56:28.014
Tom Campbell
and Governor Savannah Gherrity,

764
00:56:28.056 --> 00:56:29.265
who are en route as we speak.

765
00:56:29.307 --> 00:56:30.516
Governor?

766
00:56:30.558 --> 00:56:32.560
- At the same time,
we are saddened

767
00:56:32.602 --> 00:56:34.687
to learn of the passing
of lead medical officer

768
00:56:34.729 --> 00:56:37.774
Megan Benson, who passed away
early in the mission

769
00:56:37.815 --> 00:56:39.567
from as-yet-unknown causes.

770
00:56:39.609 --> 00:56:41.611
- What do you think happened?

771
00:56:48.534 --> 00:56:50.995
- No, no, Benson, stop! Benson!

772
00:56:54.123 --> 00:56:56.834
She passed in her sleep.

773
00:56:58.044 --> 00:57:00.213
And as far as we can tell,

774
00:57:00.254 --> 00:57:04.175
it was either cardiac arrest
or an aneurysm.

775
00:57:05.593 --> 00:57:08.054
- I'm sure you all have
endless questions.

776
00:57:08.096 --> 00:57:09.239
Captain Kwan,
Lieutenant Gherrity?

777
00:57:09.263 --> 00:57:11.140
- Adam?

778
00:57:11.182 --> 00:57:15.937
- Savvie.

779
00:57:25.655 --> 00:57:28.199
- Hi.

780
00:57:28.241 --> 00:57:30.618
- One more question.
One question.

781
00:57:30.660 --> 00:57:31.702
- Let's go home.

782
00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:35.540
- What are you gonna do first?

783
00:57:51.681 --> 00:57:53.474
- Hi.
So next up is the MRI.

784
00:57:53.516 --> 00:57:55.727
They're just getting set up.
- Okay.

785
00:57:55.768 --> 00:57:57.311
Thank you.

786
00:57:58.646 --> 00:58:00.273
My God.

787
00:58:00.314 --> 00:58:03.192
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

788
00:58:10.241 --> 00:58:11.451
Yep.

789
00:58:14.036 --> 00:58:15.371
- Hi.

790
00:58:19.041 --> 00:58:20.543
- Tom.

791
00:58:20.585 --> 00:58:22.670
Um.

792
00:58:22.712 --> 00:58:25.006
Hi.

793
00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:31.596
- Wait. Wait one second.

794
00:58:31.637 --> 00:58:35.808
If you have gone and pulled
a "Castaway" on me

795
00:58:35.850 --> 00:58:38.853
and married someone else,
totally cool.

796
00:58:38.895 --> 00:58:40.521
Just tell me now
because I don't think

797
00:58:40.563 --> 00:58:42.023
I could actually do...
- No.

798
00:58:42.065 --> 00:58:43.733
- No?

799
00:58:45.359 --> 00:58:46.486
- Still here.

800
00:58:50.239 --> 00:58:52.867
- Didn't you think I was dead?

801
00:58:56.579 --> 00:58:59.248
- Do we have to do this now?

802
00:58:59.290 --> 00:59:01.334
- Yeah, I mean, why not?

803
00:59:01.375 --> 00:59:03.544
What else is there
to talk about?

804
00:59:03.586 --> 00:59:06.547
I mean, I wanna know.

805
00:59:06.589 --> 00:59:10.593
- After about a year, my sister
set me up with someone.

806
00:59:10.635 --> 00:59:11.886
- Sure.

807
00:59:11.928 --> 00:59:14.597
- And then...

808
00:59:14.639 --> 00:59:18.101
there were three or four
other short things after that.

809
00:59:18.142 --> 00:59:20.520
They... they... they just... they...

810
00:59:22.939 --> 00:59:24.774
Nothing ever took.

811
00:59:28.903 --> 00:59:31.406
They couldn't hold
a candle to you.

812
00:59:41.791 --> 00:59:45.420
- Sorry about the whole
kiss attack thing earlier.

813
00:59:47.422 --> 00:59:49.841
I was just really excited
to see you.

814
00:59:49.882 --> 00:59:52.677
And I had my team
in my head just telling me

815
00:59:52.719 --> 00:59:54.470
what an important moment
this was,

816
00:59:54.512 --> 00:59:58.349
and everything had to go
just right, and...

817
00:59:58.391 --> 01:00:03.855
inside, I was just terrified.

818
01:00:03.896 --> 01:00:06.858
- Of what?

819
01:00:06.899 --> 01:00:09.444
- I don't know.

820
01:00:09.485 --> 01:00:11.237
Three years is a long time.

821
01:00:11.279 --> 01:00:12.655
-Yeah.

822
01:00:14.323 --> 01:00:17.076
- I really didn't think I was
ever gonna see you again.

823
01:00:17.118 --> 01:00:18.494
- Same.

824
01:00:21.706 --> 01:00:25.126
- God knows what you must think
of all this governor stuff.

825
01:00:26.669 --> 01:00:28.814
- No, because I feel like
I need to explain this to you

826
01:00:28.838 --> 01:00:31.966
because listen,
when you disappeared,

827
01:00:32.008 --> 01:00:36.679
there was suddenly
this spotlight on me.

828
01:00:36.721 --> 01:00:39.265
And I couldn't just go out
and have death rebound sex

829
01:00:39.307 --> 01:00:41.851
like a normal person.

830
01:00:43.352 --> 01:00:47.065
I had to just play the part
and meet the expectations,

831
01:00:47.106 --> 01:00:48.775
and I was stuck.

832
01:00:50.693 --> 01:00:55.156
All I had was my work.

833
01:00:55.198 --> 01:00:59.410
So then this opportunity to run
came up, and I just took it.

834
01:00:59.452 --> 01:01:03.081
- Listen, babe,
I'm proud of you.

835
01:01:05.124 --> 01:01:06.709
- You are?
- Yeah.

836
01:01:17.053 --> 01:01:22.016
So here, you have the
marijuana kush or flower.

837
01:01:22.058 --> 01:01:24.352
Here, you have the blueberry,
luscious, wholesome.

838
01:01:24.394 --> 01:01:27.397
- She was, like,
screaming at Adam...

839
01:01:27.438 --> 01:01:29.273
coming toward, um...

840
01:01:47.417 --> 01:01:49.252
- We have one
that goes like this.

841
01:01:51.087 --> 01:01:52.463
Slower.

842
01:01:52.505 --> 01:01:53.965
And it's erratic,

843
01:01:54.006 --> 01:01:55.466
but that's what I like about it.

844
01:01:58.636 --> 01:01:59.762
You wanna try?

845
01:02:02.432 --> 01:02:03.516
- Yeah, I'm fine.

846
01:02:04.976 --> 01:02:06.936
- I'm fine.

847
01:02:06.978 --> 01:02:08.479
I'm okay.

848
01:02:10.106 --> 01:02:12.775
- Just...
- Just happy to be home.

849
01:02:16.112 --> 01:02:17.488
- Where is this guy?

850
01:02:17.530 --> 01:02:19.699
They run out of ink?

851
01:02:19.741 --> 01:02:22.160
It's NASA, don't... don't they
have printers here?

852
01:02:22.201 --> 01:02:23.453
Sign these papers.

853
01:02:23.494 --> 01:02:25.121
Sign this paper.

854
01:02:25.163 --> 01:02:28.416
It doesn't feel real.

855
01:02:28.458 --> 01:02:30.418
- I'm here.
- I know.

856
01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:32.253
- I'm so sorry.

857
01:02:32.295 --> 01:02:34.297
We just need a few more
security guards out there

858
01:02:34.338 --> 01:02:36.257
to help keep the press at bay.

859
01:02:36.299 --> 01:02:39.177
- No worries.
- Not a problem.

860
01:02:39.218 --> 01:02:42.430
I promise it's gonna
start feeling normal soon.

861
01:02:42.472 --> 01:02:43.639
- Yeah.

862
01:02:43.681 --> 01:02:45.850
I'm so glad
we didn't miss you guys.

863
01:02:45.892 --> 01:02:47.435
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

864
01:02:47.477 --> 01:02:48.936
It's so good to see you, Jane.

865
01:02:48.978 --> 01:02:50.646
- You too, Savannah.
- Hi.

866
01:02:50.688 --> 01:02:52.982
That farewell dinner
feels like a lifetime ago.

867
01:02:53.024 --> 01:02:55.443
My God, yeah, two lifetimes ago.

868
01:02:55.485 --> 01:02:56.444
- I know.
- Hey.

869
01:02:56.486 --> 01:02:57.570
Hey. How's it going?

870
01:02:57.612 --> 01:02:58.964
- Thanks for taking care
of my girl.

871
01:02:58.988 --> 01:03:00.323
- More like she took care of me.

872
01:03:03.159 --> 01:03:05.453
- I'm keeping the girls.

873
01:03:05.495 --> 01:03:06.537
Yeah.

874
01:03:06.579 --> 01:03:07.789
- The girls?
- The hens.

875
01:03:07.830 --> 01:03:09.832
That's what we call the hens.

876
01:03:09.874 --> 01:03:12.168
- Unless you guys want some.

877
01:03:12.210 --> 01:03:13.961
- Um...
- Why not?

878
01:03:14.003 --> 01:03:15.963
We've got the space.
- I don't know.

879
01:03:16.005 --> 01:03:18.091
You know, if I deployed...
- Come on.

880
01:03:18.132 --> 01:03:20.927
You guys are international
space heroes now.

881
01:03:20.968 --> 01:03:22.637
Your deployment days
are behind you.

882
01:03:22.678 --> 01:03:24.239
I mean, you're celebrities.
- Okay, okay.

883
01:03:24.263 --> 01:03:25.741
It's just they make a mess.
- Wait, wait, wait.

884
01:03:25.765 --> 01:03:27.934
How much of a mess
are we talking about here?

885
01:03:27.975 --> 01:03:29.519
- No, they're great.
- They're great.

886
01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:31.187
I'm really glad
you're taking them.

887
01:03:31.229 --> 01:03:35.650
I wanted to take Benson home,
but they said no, so...

888
01:03:37.318 --> 01:03:39.946
- Okay, so your discharge
papers are ready now.

889
01:03:39.987 --> 01:03:41.697
- All right.
- Hey, you know what?

890
01:03:41.739 --> 01:03:42.966
Why don't Tom and I handle this?

891
01:03:42.990 --> 01:03:45.326
You guys just take a minute.
Say goodbye.

892
01:03:45.368 --> 01:03:46.828
Yeah. I got it.

893
01:03:46.869 --> 01:03:48.347
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah, of course.

894
01:03:48.371 --> 01:03:49.914
- Yeah. Yeah.
- All right.

895
01:03:54.752 --> 01:03:56.337
- Ate a Pop-Tart this morning.

896
01:03:56.379 --> 01:03:58.256
Yeah? How was it?

897
01:03:58.297 --> 01:04:01.426
- Well, after your homemade
ones, I'm a little ruined.

898
01:04:01.467 --> 01:04:04.178
Well.

899
01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:05.847
I'll get you the recipe.

900
01:04:05.888 --> 01:04:08.224
All you need is a steady supply
of fresh,

901
01:04:08.266 --> 01:04:10.893
unpasteurized goat's milk.

902
01:04:12.812 --> 01:04:15.314
- So I'll hear from you.

903
01:04:15.356 --> 01:04:17.000
- Yeah, of course.
I mean, we'll see each other.

904
01:04:17.024 --> 01:04:18.210
We've got interviews coming up...

905
01:04:18.234 --> 01:04:19.234
- Not like that.

906
01:04:21.571 --> 01:04:23.364
Will you be a part of my life?

907
01:04:31.247 --> 01:04:32.999
- No.

908
01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:35.418
- Come on.

909
01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:39.005
Just a phone call
every now and then, you know?

910
01:04:39.047 --> 01:04:41.049
Old friends
checking up on each other.

911
01:04:41.090 --> 01:04:44.719
- Adam, we were stuck
in a box for three years,

912
01:04:44.761 --> 01:04:47.555
and it messed with our heads.

913
01:04:47.597 --> 01:04:48.931
And now we're out of that box.

914
01:04:51.434 --> 01:04:52.810
This is real.

915
01:04:52.852 --> 01:04:55.772
Up there, it wasn't real.

916
01:04:57.273 --> 01:04:59.400
- You ready?

917
01:04:59.442 --> 01:05:02.070
Yeah.

918
01:05:03.821 --> 01:05:07.533
So, well, bye.

919
01:05:07.575 --> 01:05:09.660
- See you guys.
- Bye.

920
01:05:09.702 --> 01:05:10.787
See you, Adam.

921
01:05:13.539 --> 01:05:17.210
Discharged.
- Discharged.

922
01:05:17.251 --> 01:05:23.049
- We're on in five, four,
three, two...

923
01:05:23.091 --> 01:05:24.967
- Adam, the world wants to know.

924
01:05:25.009 --> 01:05:27.720
How did you survive in space?

925
01:05:27.762 --> 01:05:29.055
- Well, that's
a loaded question.

926
01:05:29.097 --> 01:05:30.640
- Yeah.

927
01:05:30.681 --> 01:05:33.935
We basically had a living,
breathing ecosystem

928
01:05:33.976 --> 01:05:35.937
on the ship, so we were able

929
01:05:35.978 --> 01:05:37.438
to sustain our own food,

930
01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:39.607
and the ship created oxygen.

931
01:05:39.649 --> 01:05:42.527
And we, um,

932
01:05:42.568 --> 01:05:44.362
we made our way through it.

933
01:05:44.404 --> 01:05:46.906
- He was just circling
the grocery parking lot.

934
01:05:46.948 --> 01:05:48.133
- Is this the
parking lot story again?

935
01:05:48.157 --> 01:05:49.409
- Over and over.
- Come on.

936
01:05:49.450 --> 01:05:51.786
- I wanna, like, close it.
There we go.

937
01:05:55.498 --> 01:05:58.126
- So what have the two of you
been doing to reconnect,

938
01:05:58.167 --> 01:06:00.670
I mean, after three years?

939
01:06:00.712 --> 01:06:02.213
- Well, we've been trying
to make up

940
01:06:02.255 --> 01:06:04.298
for lost time, you know?

941
01:06:14.058 --> 01:06:16.686
And my wife's the governor.

942
01:06:16.728 --> 01:06:19.355
- Yeah, so that's a little...
different.

943
01:06:19.397 --> 01:06:21.083
- Yeah, you know what, Frank?
I don't wanna hear it.

944
01:06:21.107 --> 01:06:23.234
This bill's gonna go through
with or without you.

945
01:06:23.276 --> 01:06:25.587
So you can either choose to be
on the side of the poor kids

946
01:06:25.611 --> 01:06:27.947
who wanna learn their colors
and their goddamn ABCs

947
01:06:27.989 --> 01:06:30.450
or you can cast a losing vote
against equal access

948
01:06:30.491 --> 01:06:33.327
to education and deal
with the voters in November.

949
01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:37.165
Good choice, Frank.

950
01:06:37.206 --> 01:06:38.708
Hi.
- You know, this isn't fair.

951
01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:40.501
- What?
- I orbit Jupiter,

952
01:06:40.543 --> 01:06:43.171
I come home, and I'm still
a schlub in this relationship.

953
01:06:43.212 --> 01:06:45.298
- Yeah, well, you're my schlub.

954
01:06:45.339 --> 01:06:47.925
Governor.

955
01:07:01.439 --> 01:07:05.109
- You know, this one
is my favorite.

956
01:07:07.528 --> 01:07:08.863
Really?

957
01:07:08.905 --> 01:07:11.199
- I thought you hated tattoos.

958
01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:13.701
- Well, yeah,
normally I do, but...

959
01:07:13.743 --> 01:07:16.954
all of these, they're like...

960
01:07:16.996 --> 01:07:20.792
You know, like a map of your
grand adventure up there.

961
01:07:20.833 --> 01:07:23.044
- I like that.

962
01:07:23.086 --> 01:07:24.921
- I can just, boop, boop.

963
01:07:26.464 --> 01:07:27.464
- Hello.

964
01:07:30.885 --> 01:07:32.428
What was your favorite part?

965
01:07:34.806 --> 01:07:37.558
- Um...

966
01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:41.771
I guess the dancing.

967
01:07:41.813 --> 01:07:45.400
Adam made a surprisingly
good dance partner.

968
01:07:48.611 --> 01:07:50.613
That's good.

969
01:07:50.655 --> 01:07:54.242
I'm guessing the worst part
was losing Benson, right?

970
01:07:54.283 --> 01:07:55.743
You know, I actually
never asked.

971
01:07:55.785 --> 01:07:59.163
Who found her? Was it you?

972
01:07:59.205 --> 01:08:00.581
- No.

973
01:08:00.623 --> 01:08:02.500
Adam found her.
- Good.

974
01:08:11.634 --> 01:08:14.137
- What do you think
about going on a trip?

975
01:08:15.888 --> 01:08:18.015
- A trip?

976
01:08:18.057 --> 01:08:21.769
- Yeah, Iceland,
to see the northern lights.

977
01:08:21.811 --> 01:08:23.438
Iceland?

978
01:08:26.941 --> 01:08:28.651
- Yeah, sure.

979
01:08:28.693 --> 01:08:31.279
But, I mean, I... I...

980
01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:32.989
It feels like you just gone back

981
01:08:33.030 --> 01:08:35.658
and you're ready
to leave again so soon?

982
01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:37.952
No, I just,

983
01:08:37.994 --> 01:08:41.998
um, thought it would be
a nice way to reconnect.

984
01:08:43.666 --> 01:08:46.461
No...

985
01:08:46.502 --> 01:08:48.004
I'm sorry.

986
01:08:50.506 --> 01:08:52.425
Look, of course
you wanna go on a trip.

987
01:08:52.467 --> 01:08:57.096
I keep forgetting
that you were trapped

988
01:08:57.138 --> 01:08:59.474
in a box
for the last three years.

989
01:08:59.515 --> 01:09:01.184
Yeah.

990
01:09:01.225 --> 01:09:05.104
We can go on a trip, anywhere
you want, just you and me.

991
01:09:22.413 --> 01:09:24.874
- And how are you getting on
now that you're home?

992
01:09:24.916 --> 01:09:27.043
- Um, very well. Thank you.

993
01:09:27.085 --> 01:09:30.463
- I'd imagine the boredom
would be the worst bit.

994
01:09:30.505 --> 01:09:33.007
- You know, we never really
experienced boredom.

995
01:09:33.049 --> 01:09:34.842
There was always things to do.

996
01:09:34.884 --> 01:09:36.344
- For instance?

997
01:09:36.386 --> 01:09:40.181
Well,
we would bet on chicken races,

998
01:09:40.223 --> 01:09:42.725
tried to write
the next great pop song.

999
01:09:42.767 --> 01:09:44.560
We would invent handshakes.

1000
01:09:44.602 --> 01:09:48.189
And I spent quite a bit of time
trying to crossbreed

1001
01:09:48.231 --> 01:09:51.192
a marijuana blueberry plant.

1002
01:09:51.234 --> 01:09:53.820
Actually, still working
on that one.

1003
01:09:53.861 --> 01:09:56.030
Marijuana's still legal, right?

1004
01:09:56.072 --> 01:09:57.365
- As long as I'm governor.

1005
01:10:50.418 --> 01:10:52.295
Excuse me, ma'am.
Can you help me?

1006
01:10:52.336 --> 01:10:56.466
I think I may have
dropped something.

1007
01:10:56.507 --> 01:11:00.428
Um, sure.

1008
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:01.554
- Ew!

1009
01:11:04.557 --> 01:11:07.185
So one of them
pooped on my shoe.

1010
01:11:07.226 --> 01:11:08.561
- Are you sure it was them?

1011
01:11:08.603 --> 01:11:09.604
- Was it you?

1012
01:11:09.645 --> 01:11:10.980
- Come on.
Poop is a sign of love.

1013
01:11:11.022 --> 01:11:12.482
Stop it.

1014
01:11:12.523 --> 01:11:14.723
- I think we need to talk about
moving the coop outside.

1015
01:11:15.610 --> 01:11:17.070
- Baby, they're indoor chickens.

1016
01:11:17.111 --> 01:11:18.780
That's all they know.
- They're chickens.

1017
01:11:18.821 --> 01:11:21.157
I feel like they'll adjust.

1018
01:11:59.362 --> 01:12:01.739
- I'm sorry this is
taking so long.

1019
01:12:01.781 --> 01:12:04.158
Just ten more minutes, okay?

1020
01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:05.326
- That's fine.

1021
01:12:07.537 --> 01:12:10.206
Do you maybe wanna take
this dance class with me?

1022
01:12:17.797 --> 01:12:19.048
You know I have two left feet.

1023
01:12:19.090 --> 01:12:21.175
Come on. I'd kill myself.

1024
01:12:23.678 --> 01:12:24.678
- All right.

1025
01:12:30.476 --> 01:12:34.105
Who's Amber?
- She's nobody.

1026
01:12:34.147 --> 01:12:36.649
- What's she wanna talk about?

1027
01:12:36.691 --> 01:12:37.691
- I don't know.

1028
01:12:48.619 --> 01:12:49.954
Okay.

1029
01:12:49.996 --> 01:12:52.039
We, um,

1030
01:12:52.081 --> 01:12:53.541
we went on a few dates.

1031
01:12:53.583 --> 01:12:55.585
- Okay. Recently?

1032
01:12:58.254 --> 01:12:59.464
How many dates?

1033
01:13:01.049 --> 01:13:02.091
- Five or six.

1034
01:13:02.133 --> 01:13:04.594
- Tom, you need to call her.

1035
01:13:06.179 --> 01:13:07.722
- Why?

1036
01:13:07.764 --> 01:13:10.475
- I mean, you had a
relationship with this person.

1037
01:13:10.516 --> 01:13:12.226
She deserves to know
where you are.

1038
01:13:12.268 --> 01:13:14.520
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Babe, no. No.

1039
01:13:14.562 --> 01:13:16.564
I definitely did not have
a relationship with...

1040
01:13:16.606 --> 01:13:18.983
- Maybe we should talk
to her together.

1041
01:13:19.025 --> 01:13:20.169
- What are you talking about?

1042
01:13:20.193 --> 01:13:21.611
- Yeah, like,
maybe that would help.

1043
01:13:21.652 --> 01:13:23.237
- Help what?

1044
01:13:23.279 --> 01:13:24.882
- I mean, it's not her fault
that your wife

1045
01:13:24.906 --> 01:13:27.700
miraculously returned
after three years.

1046
01:13:27.742 --> 01:13:30.369
I mean, what is
she supposed to do?

1047
01:13:30.411 --> 01:13:32.914
Act like nothing happened,
like you didn't have

1048
01:13:32.955 --> 01:13:35.166
a meaningful connection,

1049
01:13:35.208 --> 01:13:38.086
like it wasn't going somewhere?

1050
01:13:38.127 --> 01:13:39.295
Like...
- Jane, Jane.

1051
01:13:40.922 --> 01:13:43.174
- What?

1052
01:13:43.216 --> 01:13:44.759
- What's happening?

1053
01:13:47.970 --> 01:13:49.347
- Um...

1054
01:14:02.402 --> 01:14:04.153
I slept with Adam.

1055
01:14:25.466 --> 01:14:28.094
- Okay, so we got 15 minutes
for this meet and greet,

1056
01:14:28.136 --> 01:14:30.221
and then, we head
into the event.

1057
01:14:30.263 --> 01:14:31.806
Okay?

1058
01:14:31.848 --> 01:14:32.848
- Okay.

1059
01:14:35.184 --> 01:14:37.979
- Everything okay?

1060
01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:39.480
- Yeah.

1061
01:14:39.522 --> 01:14:41.607
Just been going nonstop
since I got back.

1062
01:14:41.649 --> 01:14:43.651
- I know.

1063
01:14:43.693 --> 01:14:45.862
- I don't know, maybe we could
pull back a little bit,

1064
01:14:45.903 --> 01:14:47.280
find some time to talk.

1065
01:14:47.321 --> 01:14:49.282
- We could talk right now.

1066
01:14:51.033 --> 01:14:52.493
Baby, I'm the governor.

1067
01:14:52.535 --> 01:14:54.454
I have responsibilities.
I can't just stop.

1068
01:14:54.495 --> 01:14:57.290
Yeah, your job is meet
and greets and fundraisers.

1069
01:14:57.331 --> 01:15:00.001
- Yeah, that's the job.

1070
01:15:00.043 --> 01:15:01.169
What?

1071
01:15:01.210 --> 01:15:02.271
What is it
that you wanna talk about

1072
01:15:02.295 --> 01:15:03.713
that we can't talk about
right now?

1073
01:15:03.755 --> 01:15:06.174
- I don't know, maybe the time
Benson tried to kill me

1074
01:15:06.215 --> 01:15:09.719
and Jane had to axe her
in the back to save my life.

1075
01:15:13.598 --> 01:15:15.117
- God is that what you
wanna talk about?

1076
01:15:15.141 --> 01:15:16.559
- No.

1077
01:15:23.107 --> 01:15:29.197
- See, I think I know what
you wanna talk about, but...

1078
01:15:29.238 --> 01:15:32.867
I really don't
wanna talk about it.

1079
01:15:32.909 --> 01:15:39.540
So if you could just
tell me that it's over,

1080
01:15:39.582 --> 01:15:41.709
maybe that would be enough.

1081
01:15:41.751 --> 01:15:43.920
- It is.

1082
01:15:43.961 --> 01:15:45.254
- Good.

1083
01:15:48.424 --> 01:15:49.634
Are we good?

1084
01:15:53.721 --> 01:15:54.721
- Yeah.

1085
01:15:57.183 --> 01:16:00.812
- I'll see what I can cancel
over the next few weeks, okay?

1086
01:16:00.853 --> 01:16:02.355
Thank you.

1087
01:16:04.607 --> 01:16:06.359
- There is one thing
we can't avoid, though.

1088
01:16:06.401 --> 01:16:08.069
What?

1089
01:16:52.488 --> 01:16:53.990
Hi, Jane. You look lovely.

1090
01:16:54.031 --> 01:16:56.284
- Thank you. So do you.

1091
01:16:56.325 --> 01:16:57.577
- Long time.

1092
01:16:57.618 --> 01:16:59.287
- It's been nine days.

1093
01:16:59.328 --> 01:17:00.955
Seriously?

1094
01:17:00.997 --> 01:17:04.542
- Man, I guess time's
messed up here, too, right?

1095
01:17:04.584 --> 01:17:06.461
- Where's your sweet husband?

1096
01:17:07.545 --> 01:17:09.922
Um...

1097
01:17:09.964 --> 01:17:12.967
the story for tonight
is that he has the flu.

1098
01:17:13.009 --> 01:17:16.888
But we are actually
splitting up.

1099
01:17:16.929 --> 01:17:19.348
- Wait, you're what?
- Yeah. I know.

1100
01:17:19.390 --> 01:17:21.726
It must sound...

1101
01:17:21.768 --> 01:17:26.147
And Tom, he really is perfect.

1102
01:17:26.189 --> 01:17:28.983
I think when we got married,
I thought that would be enough,

1103
01:17:29.025 --> 01:17:30.777
you know,
the fact that we make sense

1104
01:17:30.818 --> 01:17:33.488
for each other or something.

1105
01:17:33.529 --> 01:17:37.116
But we just never really fit.

1106
01:17:37.158 --> 01:17:41.079
And as much as we wanted to,
it just wasn't meant to be.

1107
01:17:42.288 --> 01:17:43.790
- Wow.

1108
01:17:43.831 --> 01:17:44.707
Poor Tom.

1109
01:17:44.749 --> 01:17:46.167
He is better off.

1110
01:17:46.209 --> 01:17:47.377
- I'm sure.

1111
01:17:49.128 --> 01:17:50.713
I didn't mean that
how it sounded.

1112
01:17:50.755 --> 01:17:53.633
I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

1113
01:17:53.674 --> 01:17:57.220
- Well, don't let us
keep you from mingling.

1114
01:17:57.261 --> 01:17:59.389
Yeah, right, um...

1115
01:18:00.807 --> 01:18:01.807
Okay.

1116
01:18:06.854 --> 01:18:10.483
- So what I usually do is
crumble the Pop Tarts

1117
01:18:10.525 --> 01:18:12.360
into the eggs and scramble.

1118
01:18:12.402 --> 01:18:14.028
- Yeah, every Halloween.

1119
01:18:14.070 --> 01:18:15.113
Little astronaut.

1120
01:18:17.448 --> 01:18:19.534
What were you...

1121
01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:24.122
Madame President.

1122
01:18:24.163 --> 01:18:27.792
- I understand you both
are excellent dancers.

1123
01:18:27.834 --> 01:18:30.044
Um...

1124
01:18:30.086 --> 01:18:32.714
- No.
- Please.

1125
01:18:32.755 --> 01:18:35.007
Won't you honor us with a dance?

1126
01:18:35.049 --> 01:18:37.427
- I don't think...
- No, I feel...

1127
01:18:37.468 --> 01:18:38.761
- I insist.

1128
01:18:40.513 --> 01:18:41.681
- Of course.

1129
01:21:40.610 --> 01:21:41.944
- That was great.

1130
01:21:47.950 --> 01:21:50.244
- Well, we are so glad
that you're back.

1131
01:21:50.286 --> 01:21:51.329
- It's been great.

1132
01:21:51.370 --> 01:21:53.372
- And that waltz,
you were wonderful.

1133
01:21:53.414 --> 01:21:55.958
- Thank you, Madame President.
- I told you you would be.

1134
01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:57.418
Happy campaigning to you.

1135
01:21:57.460 --> 01:21:59.629
I know you'll do
a wonderful job for your state.

1136
01:21:59.670 --> 01:22:02.340
They're lucky to have you.
- Thank you.

1137
01:22:02.382 --> 01:22:03.800
- Well, take care.

1138
01:22:03.841 --> 01:22:05.927
- Thank you.

1139
01:22:22.610 --> 01:22:24.320
- Just say it.

1140
01:22:24.362 --> 01:22:26.572
I love you.

1141
01:22:26.614 --> 01:22:27.740
You're an asshole.

1142
01:22:34.664 --> 01:22:36.082
What happened up there?

1143
01:22:36.124 --> 01:22:37.417
- Nothing.

1144
01:22:41.421 --> 01:22:43.005
And everything.

1145
01:22:47.343 --> 01:22:49.804
It's okay.

1146
01:22:49.846 --> 01:22:51.681
I mean, it's not okay.

1147
01:22:57.353 --> 01:22:58.896
- Can I...

1148
01:23:10.491 --> 01:23:12.785
- Tell Jane I hate her.

1149
01:23:28.843 --> 01:23:30.261
Thank you.

1150
01:23:53.159 --> 01:23:55.036
- Hi.

1151
01:23:55.078 --> 01:23:56.370
Hey.

1152
01:24:00.041 --> 01:24:01.584
- Where's Savannah?

1153
01:24:01.626 --> 01:24:03.544
- She left.

1154
01:24:05.213 --> 01:24:07.382
- She wanted me to let you know
that she hates you.

1155
01:24:07.423 --> 01:24:08.383
- She does?

1156
01:24:08.424 --> 01:24:10.301
- Yeah.

1157
01:24:10.343 --> 01:24:11.803
- Why is that?

1158
01:24:20.478 --> 01:24:21.854
- Yeah.

1159
01:24:21.896 --> 01:24:23.815
- Okay. So...

1160
01:24:30.947 --> 01:24:33.741
Is this just, like,
an elaborate ploy

1161
01:24:33.783 --> 01:24:35.159
for my Pop-Tart recipe?

1162
01:24:35.201 --> 01:24:37.286
- Shh.

1163
01:24:40.039 --> 01:24:41.791
You wanna get a drink?

1164
01:24:44.419 --> 01:24:47.004
- You know, we should probably...

1165
01:24:47.046 --> 01:24:48.148
My God. Are you pregnant?

1166
01:24:48.172 --> 01:24:50.258
- No.
- You touched your stomach.

1167
01:24:50.299 --> 01:24:51.217
So?

1168
01:24:51.259 --> 01:24:52.403
We had all that unprotected sex.

1169
01:24:52.427 --> 01:24:55.388
Is this why you're choosing me?

1170
01:24:55.430 --> 01:24:57.265
'Cause bro,
if this is just, like,

1171
01:24:57.306 --> 01:25:00.017
your biological urge
to procreate...

1172
01:25:00.059 --> 01:25:02.395
God, no.

1173
01:25:03.813 --> 01:25:05.189
I choose you.

1174
01:25:06.649 --> 01:25:10.403
And not because I chemically
attached, which I did.

1175
01:25:10.445 --> 01:25:14.490
And not because I wanna
have your babies, which I do.

1176
01:25:16.159 --> 01:25:18.035
It's because we're meant to be.

1177
01:25:19.412 --> 01:25:20.788
- Lame.

1178
01:25:20.830 --> 01:25:22.457
We're all robots.

1179
01:25:22.498 --> 01:25:24.000
- Yeah.

1180
01:25:24.041 --> 01:25:25.960
- What I was gonna say this,
we should probably

1181
01:25:26.002 --> 01:25:28.337
keep this on the down-low
for a little while.

1182
01:25:28.379 --> 01:25:29.630
- Right. Down low.

1183
01:25:29.672 --> 01:25:31.132
- You don't wanna cause a stir.

1184
01:25:31.174 --> 01:25:33.217
- No stir.
- No stir.

1185
01:25:45.980 --> 01:25:47.273
Do you wanna go on a trip?

1186
01:25:50.276 --> 01:25:51.652
- Yeah.

1187
01:25:56.866 --> 01:25:59.327
- Okay.
- Okay.

1188
01:25:59.368 --> 01:26:03.331
- So this might be crazy, but...

1189
01:26:03.372 --> 01:26:08.336
what do you think
about renting "Aliens"?

1190
01:26:08.378 --> 01:26:10.129
- You wanna watch "Alien" again?

1191
01:26:10.171 --> 01:26:13.424
- No, "Aliens."

1192
01:26:13.466 --> 01:26:14.675
The second one.

1193
01:26:14.717 --> 01:26:17.678
- They made anoth...
- Hell... absolutely not.

1194
01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:20.765
No.
- Come on.

1195
01:26:20.807 --> 01:26:23.184
That's, like, our movie.

1196
01:26:23.226 --> 01:26:25.019
- Let's watch "Casablanca."

1197
01:26:25.061 --> 01:26:27.146
- Okay. We can watch both.

1198
01:26:27.188 --> 01:26:29.524
You wanna make it
a double feature?

1199
01:26:29.565 --> 01:26:32.360
- Perfect... the double feature
will be "Casablanca"

1200
01:26:32.402 --> 01:26:33.945
and "The Princess Bride."

1201
01:26:33.986 --> 01:26:36.864
Okay, why don't we
shut your dumb mouth

1202
01:26:36.906 --> 01:26:39.200
and we watch "Aliens"?
- Okay.

1203
01:26:39.242 --> 01:26:41.619
With the double feature
of "Casablanca."

1204
01:26:41.661 --> 01:26:43.538
We can talk through it.

1205
01:26:43.579 --> 01:26:45.373
And you have to press
your boobs against me.

1206
01:26:47.583 --> 01:26:48.876
Deal.

1207
