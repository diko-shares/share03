Oh.

I need to call
you out on something.

- Okay.

190
00:10:43.186 --> 00:10:46.022
- I was walking through
the greenhouse this morning,

191
00:10:46.064 --> 00:10:50.568
and I stepped
in some milky goop.

192

- Oh. [laughs]
My bad.

- What?

194
00:10:56.115 --> 00:10:57.217
I thought I cleaned it all up.

Oh, my God, were they...
[whispering] Watching you?

- They're chickens.

200
00:11:07.377 --> 00:11:08.628
- Ew.
- All right.

201
00:11:08.669 --> 00:11:10.004
That's enough slut shaming.

202
00:11:10.046 --> 00:11:11.339
- I am not shaming you.

203
00:11:11.381 --> 00:11:13.841
Masturbation is, like,
super healthy.

204
00:11:13.883 --> 00:11:17.845
But I keep it in my room
because I'm not a dirty ho.

- Dirty ho?

206
00:11:24.519 --> 00:11:26.479
Maybe we should do it.

207
00:11:26.521 --> 00:11:28.064
- Do what?

208
00:11:28.106 --> 00:11:29.357
- It.

- Oh, man. He's lost it.

214

- Look, in case
you haven't noticed,

215
00:11:43.746 --> 00:11:45.808
we're doomed to spend the
rest of our miserable lives

216
00:11:45.832 --> 00:11:48.126
floating around on this ship.

217
00:11:48.167 --> 00:11:50.086
So it would be crazy
for us not to bang, right?

218
00:11:50.128 --> 00:11:52.463
- Well, when you put it
like that.

219
00:11:52.505 --> 00:11:54.674
- [grunting] So you're in?

220
00:11:54.716 --> 00:11:56.968
- No.
- Why not? [grunts]

221
00:11:57.009 --> 00:11:58.761
Look, first of all,

222
00:11:58.803 --> 00:12:01.723
I don't need a reason
not to sleep with you.

223
00:12:01.764 --> 00:12:05.184
I need a reason
to have sex with you.

00:12:07.103 --> 00:12:08.438
Uh, boredom.

226
00:12:08.479 --> 00:12:09.897
The fact that,
other than Benson,

227
00:12:09.939 --> 00:12:12.108
I'm your only viable option.

228
00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:17.572

of three excellent reasons

229
00:12:17.613 --> 00:12:20.533
right off the top of my head
why we shouldn't,

230
00:12:20.575 --> 00:12:23.119
as you put it so romantically,
bang.

231
00:12:23.161 --> 00:12:24.412
Oh.
- Okay.

232
00:12:24.454 --> 00:12:27.582
Well, moment of clarification.

233
00:12:27.623 --> 00:12:29.751
I'm not talking
about romance, okay?

234
00:12:29.792 --> 00:12:32.462
This is completely
void of emotion.

235
00:12:32.503 --> 00:12:34.005
All right?

236
00:12:34.047 --> 00:12:37.258
This is all about us
using sex as a stress reliever.

237
00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.760
- Oh, no, I get it.

238
00:12:38.801 --> 00:12:40.887

so what are your three great...

239

Sorry. No, actually...
- Are you okay?

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:45.558
- It's nothing. Yeah.

242
00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.952
What were you saying?
- What happened?

243
00:12:46.976 --> 00:12:50.021
- It's really... it's just
a little scratch.

244
00:12:50.063 --> 00:12:51.105
Ah!

245
00:12:51.147 --> 00:12:52.648
That's not a scratch.

246
00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:55.318
- It was just
the freaking tool cart.

247
00:12:55.359 --> 00:12:56.628
- Look, you need
some antibiotics.

248
00:12:56.652 --> 00:12:58.696
- No, we only have
one course left.

249
00:12:58.738 --> 00:13:01.115
I am not using it
on this little cut.

250
00:13:01.157 --> 00:13:02.909
- Well, what if
the infection spreads?

251
00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:04.660
- People don't die
from little cuts.

252
00:13:04.702 --> 00:13:06.204
- Yeah, because
they use antibiotics.

253
00:13:06.245 --> 00:13:07.747
- It's fine.

254
00:13:12.085 --> 00:13:15.505
[soft music]

255
00:13:15.546 --> 00:13:17.465
- So you were saying?

256
00:13:17.507 --> 00:13:18.966
- What?

257
00:13:19.008 --> 00:13:22.303
- You were saying why we
shouldn't do sex on each other.

258
00:13:22.345 --> 00:13:24.013
- Oh.

259
00:13:24.055 --> 00:13:30.311
- Well, number one,
I'm not attracted to you.

260
00:13:30.353 --> 00:13:32.480
- [laughs]

261
00:13:32.522 --> 00:13:35.483
That's an argument for,
not against.

262
00:13:35.525 --> 00:13:36.818
- How?

263
00:13:36.859 --> 00:13:38.778
- Because if we were
attracted to each other,

264
00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:41.864
then "banging" could possibly
turn into something

265
00:13:41.906 --> 00:13:42.949
and it would get messy.

266
00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:44.242
- Super messy.
- Right.

267
00:13:44.283 --> 00:13:45.993
So the fact that you're
not attracted to me

268
00:13:46.035 --> 00:13:48.204
is a benefit because
we don't have to worry

269
00:13:48.246 --> 00:13:49.705
about getting messy.

270
00:13:49.747 --> 00:13:50.915
Quick pinch.

271
00:13:50.957 --> 00:13:52.208
- Ow!

272
00:13:54.585 --> 00:13:56.546
So wait.

273
00:13:56.587 --> 00:13:59.215
You are not attracted
to me, either?

274
00:13:59.257 --> 00:14:00.842
- Absolutely not.

[scoffs]

276
00:14:02.218 --> 00:14:03.928
- Okay.

277
00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:05.513
- Do you want me to be?
- No.

278
00:14:05.555 --> 00:14:08.224
Obviously, not.

279
00:14:08.266 --> 00:14:10.518
I'm just surprised
this is the first time

280
00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.646
us "banging"
has occurred to you.

281
00:14:13.688 --> 00:14:16.899
- I didn't say that.

282
00:14:16.941 --> 00:14:19.026
You've never thought about it?

283
00:14:19.068 --> 00:14:23.239
- I mean, you have the only
penis for a million miles.

284
00:14:23.281 --> 00:14:25.366
- See?

285
00:14:25.408 --> 00:14:27.326
There you go.

286
00:14:28.786 --> 00:14:32.832
So let's keep this
dry and clean.

287
00:14:32.874 --> 00:14:37.670
And if it starts to hurt,
you let me know ASAP.

288
00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:40.673
Okay?

289
00:14:40.715 --> 00:14:41.883
- Yep.

290
00:14:44.302 --> 00:14:48.514
So was this a debate, or are
you making a formal proposal?

291
00:14:48.556 --> 00:14:51.434
- Ah, it's a debate.

292
00:14:51.476 --> 00:14:52.477
- [laughs]

293
00:14:52.518 --> 00:14:53.728
- Unless I'm convincing you,

294
00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:55.229
then we definitely should do it.

295
00:14:57.565 --> 00:14:59.067
- My point still stands.

296
00:14:59.108 --> 00:15:00.026
- How so?

297
00:15:00.068 --> 00:15:02.361
- Well, we're not attracted now,

298
00:15:02.403 --> 00:15:03.696
but if we started having sex,

299
00:15:03.738 --> 00:15:07.075
even if we just said
it was "banging,"

300
00:15:07.116 --> 00:15:09.911
our hormones
would eventually take over

301
00:15:09.952 --> 00:15:11.245
and we would emotionally attach.

302
00:15:11.287 --> 00:15:14.415
- And when you say attach,
you mean fall in love?

303
00:15:14.457 --> 00:15:16.125
- Sure.

304
00:15:16.167 --> 00:15:18.711
That's the whole reason why
arranged marriages work.

305
00:15:18.753 --> 00:15:20.421
Maybe you think
the other person's gross

306
00:15:20.463 --> 00:15:22.924
when you meet them, but your
brain knows you're stuck.

307
00:15:22.965 --> 00:15:24.425
Biology takes over.

308
00:15:24.467 --> 00:15:26.010
- You're such a romantic.

309
00:15:26.052 --> 00:15:27.762
- Dude, it's science.
You are a scientist.

310
00:15:27.804 --> 00:15:29.889
- Yeah, and as a scientist,
I can point out

311
00:15:29.931 --> 00:15:32.392
all sorts
of evolutionary benefits

312
00:15:32.433 --> 00:15:34.185
to emotional connection.

313
00:15:34.227 --> 00:15:37.355
But that doesn't mean I think
love is a chemical reaction.

314
00:15:37.397 --> 00:15:39.524
No, not at all.

315
00:15:39.565 --> 00:15:41.109
People are meant to be together.

316
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:43.986
And it has nothing to do with
scent or a primal instinct

317
00:15:44.028 --> 00:15:49.075
or unavoidable circumstances,
it's just...

318
00:15:49.117 --> 00:15:53.329
I don't know, they just, like,
belong together, you know?

319
00:15:55.248 --> 00:15:57.417
- Oh, sorry.
Is this... is this on?

320
00:15:57.458 --> 00:15:58.626
Okay.

Lame.

322
00:16:00.169 --> 00:16:01.254
Can I get a lame?

323
00:16:01.295 --> 00:16:04.716
Uh, yes, because we are
all just robots.

324
00:16:04.757 --> 00:16:06.443
- Yeah, and by your logic,
it doesn't matter

325
00:16:06.467 --> 00:16:10.304
if we have sex or not,
because we're emotionally

326
00:16:10.346 --> 00:16:13.766
attached anyhow, because our
monkey brains will tell us

327
00:16:13.808 --> 00:16:15.476
that's our best chance
at survival.

328
00:16:15.518 --> 00:16:19.063
- Or one of us kills
the other to gain full control

329
00:16:19.105 --> 00:16:21.441
over our limited resources.

330
00:16:24.736 --> 00:16:26.362
- What's number two?

331
00:16:26.404 --> 00:16:28.656
- Reason number two.

332
00:16:28.698 --> 00:16:30.074
We're both married.

333
00:16:31.993 --> 00:16:34.912
[bell dings]

334
00:16:34.954 --> 00:16:37.039
- Like I was saying, I don't
see what the problem is.

335
00:16:37.081 --> 00:16:39.250
- You don't think the fact
that we're both married

336
00:16:39.292 --> 00:16:41.294
should have an impact
on whether we sleep together?

337
00:16:41.335 --> 00:16:42.837
- I mean, granted,
I haven't read

338
00:16:42.879 --> 00:16:44.297
my marriage license in a while,

339
00:16:44.338 --> 00:16:46.966
but I'm sure
being adrift in space

340
00:16:47.008 --> 00:16:49.510
with no hope of rescue
gives you a hall pass.

341
00:16:49.552 --> 00:16:53.389
- Okay, first of all, there's
not no possibility of rescue.

342
00:16:53.431 --> 00:16:57.018
- We literally talked
about this yesterday.

343
00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:59.687
- That was two weeks ago.

344
00:16:59.729 --> 00:17:01.773
- Really?
- Yeah.

345
00:17:01.814 --> 00:17:03.816
- Man, time out here is whacked.

346
00:17:03.858 --> 00:17:06.360
- Look, maybe we don't
get saved,

347
00:17:06.402 --> 00:17:08.988
but I, for one,
still think we can fix this.

348
00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:11.282
- Ah, how's that
working out for you?

349
00:17:11.324 --> 00:17:12.825
- You know,
I'm so glad you asked,

350
00:17:12.867 --> 00:17:15.411
because it would be better
if someone helped.

351
00:17:15.453 --> 00:17:17.580
- There are hundreds
of wires over there.

352
00:17:17.622 --> 00:17:20.583
That means there's billions
of possible combinations.

353
00:17:20.625 --> 00:17:23.503
It's a waste of time.

354
00:17:23.544 --> 00:17:26.214
- What else
am I supposed to be doing?

355
00:17:28.674 --> 00:17:30.718
Okay. You have a hall pass.

356
00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.261
I don't want one.

357
00:17:32.303 --> 00:17:35.223
- What, because your brain
