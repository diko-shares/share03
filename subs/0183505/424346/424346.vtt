00:00:29.131 --> 00:00:32.843
<i>I got a star on my car and one on my chest</i>

2
00:00:32.926 --> 00:00:35.428
<i>A gun on my hip and the right to arrest</i>

3
00:00:35.512 --> 00:00:39.182
<i>I'm a guy who's the boss on this highway</i>

4
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:42.144
<i>So watch out what you're doin'</i>
<i>when you're drivin'my way</i>

5
00:00:42.227 --> 00:00:45.230
<i>If you break the law,</i>
<i>you'll hear from me, I know</i>

6
00:00:45.313 --> 00:00:49.985
<i>I'm workin'for the state,</i>
<i>I'm the highway patrol</i>

7
00:00:51.862 --> 00:00:55.198
<i>Well, you'll know me when you see me</i>
<i>cos my door's painted white</i>

8
00:00:55.282 --> 00:00:58.285
<i>My siren a-screamin'</i>
<i>and my flashin'red light</i>

9
00:00:58.368 --> 00:01:01.329
<i>I work all day and I work all night</i>

10
00:01:01.413 --> 00:01:04.332
<i>Just to keep the law and order,</i>
<i>tryin' to do what's right</i>

11
00:01:04.416 --> 00:01:07.586
<i>If I write you out a ticket,</i>
<i>then you'd better drive slow</i>

12
00:01:07.669 --> 00:01:11.965
<i>I'm just a-doin'my job,</i>
<i>I'm the highway patrol</i>

13
00:01:13.967 --> 00:01:17.387
<i>I'm the highway patrol,</i>
<i>the highway patrol</i>

14
00:01:17.471 --> 00:01:20.390
<i>My hours are long and my pay is low</i>

15
00:01:20.474 --> 00:01:23.518
<i>But I'll do my best to keep you drivin'slow</i>

16
00:01:23.602 --> 00:01:27.898
<i>I'm just a-doin'my job,</i>
<i>I'm the highway patrol</i>

17
00:01:58.303 --> 00:02:02.641
<i>Meet Charlie.</i>
<i>Helpful dad, upstanding citizen...</i>

18
00:02:02.724 --> 00:02:08.355
<i>... and an 18-year veteran of the greatest</i>
<i>law enforcement agency in the land:</i>

19
00:02:08.438 --> 00:02:11.608
<i>... the Rhode Island State Police.</i>

20
00:02:16.613 --> 00:02:20.450
<i>That's Charlie's home. Modest, like the man.</i>

21
00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:26.248
<i>Even though he lived on the water,</i>
<i>Charlie wasn't much of a swimmer...</i>

22
00:02:26.331 --> 00:02:29.501
<i>... which will come into play</i>
<i>a little later in our story.</i>

23
00:02:29.584 --> 00:02:32.379
<i>But I'm getting way ahead of myself.</i>

24
00:02:32.462 --> 00:02:37.050
<i>You know, maybe it's best</i>
<i>if we just go back and begin at the beginning.</i>

25
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.097
<i>As a young man,</i>
<i>Charlie had the world by its bootstraps.</i>

26
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.683
<i>He was the best young trooper on the force...</i>

27
00:02:44.766 --> 00:02:48.478
<i>... and was dating</i>
<i>the prettiest and smartest gal in town.</i>

28
00:02:48.562 --> 00:02:51.690
<i>Her name was Layla... just like the melody.</i>

29
00:02:51.773 --> 00:02:53.775
Mm, Charlie...

30
00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:56.695
...you've no idea how much I love you.

31
00:03:00.574 --> 00:03:02.576
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

32
00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.580
Well, will you stay with me no matter what?

33
00:03:06.663 --> 00:03:08.665
Of course, Charlie.

34
00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.628
What if I had to move to the Arctic
and you could never come home...

35
00:03:13.712 --> 00:03:18.175
...and had to eat whale blubber for the rest
of your life? Would you still stay with me?

36
00:03:18.258 --> 00:03:20.093
Yeah, I'd stay.

37
00:03:23.513 --> 00:03:25.557
But I hope that never happens.

38
00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.684
Yeah, me too.

39
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.026
<i>Well, by springtime they had made it official.</i>

40
00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:39.112
<i>Boy, let me tell you, that was some wedding.</i>

41
00:03:39.196 --> 00:03:42.032
<i>It was presided over</i>
<i>by Father Ken Gumbert...</i>

42
00:03:42.115 --> 00:03:46.328
<i>... and half of the Rhode Island</i>
<i>State Police Force was in attendance.</i>

43
00:03:49.122 --> 00:03:52.292
- Congratulations, Charlie.
- Thank you, Captain.

44
00:04:11.061 --> 00:04:13.063
All right!

45
00:04:15.607 --> 00:04:17.609
Look what I got!

46
00:04:17.692 --> 00:04:20.153
Whoo! Here you go.

47
00:04:24.658 --> 00:04:26.660
Mm...

48
00:04:27.661 --> 00:04:29.704
Oh, um...

49
00:04:29.788 --> 00:04:33.083
Excuse me, do you people take cheques?

50
00:04:33.166 --> 00:04:37.712
Say that again. Do "we people" take cheques?
You mean a black man?

51
00:04:37.796 --> 00:04:39.881
No, no, no, no! God, no. Your company.

52
00:04:39.965 --> 00:04:43.218
Don't give me that bullshit!
That was a racist slur.

53
00:04:43.301 --> 00:04:47.514
- No, it wasn't, really. I would never...
- Tell you what, I'll make it easy for you.

54
00:04:47.597 --> 00:04:51.309
Why don't you just pay me in cotton
or a cartload of watermelons?

55
00:04:51.393 --> 00:04:57.023
Or how's about some fried chicken cos you
know how black people love fried chicken!

56
00:04:57.107 --> 00:04:59.526
- Hey, no, come on now.
- What's going on?

57
00:04:59.609 --> 00:05:03.989
This cat don't believe a nigger knows how
to cash a cheque! Ain't that 'bout a bitch?!

58
00:05:04.072 --> 00:05:07.451
Charlie, I don't wanna ever hear you
use the n-word in this house.

59
00:05:07.534 --> 00:05:11.705
What! I...
I never said anything remotely racist!

60
00:05:11.788 --> 00:05:15.542
- Oh, so it's a "little people" thing, then.
- No!

61
00:05:15.625 --> 00:05:20.338
You thinkjust cos I'm small you can
push me around? Well, come on, let's boogie.

62
00:05:20.422 --> 00:05:23.967
I'm gonna give you a little lesson
in low centre of gravity.

63
00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:26.386
Hey! Whoa! Hey! Stop it!

64
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.847
Hey, cut it... Stop it now. Sir!

65
00:05:29.431 --> 00:05:32.100
Don't patronise me with that "Sir" crap!

66
00:05:32.184 --> 00:05:34.770
- Oh, oh!
- Hey, those are illegal. Stop.

67
00:05:34.853 --> 00:05:36.855
Ooh, God! Ow!

68
00:05:39.858 --> 00:05:42.235
Oh, it's on now. It's on!

69
00:05:42.486 --> 00:05:44.154
Argh! Oh!

70
00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.782
- Charlie, don't hit him!
- Me?!

71
00:05:47.783 --> 00:05:51.161
Oh, Charlie! Charlie!
Charlie, stop it! Charlie, stop it!

72
00:05:51.244 --> 00:05:53.872
Hey! Hey!
Hey, just let me handle this. Stop it!

73
00:05:55.832 --> 00:05:59.628
Excuse me, Mr, um... um, Jackson. Uh...

74
00:06:00.504 --> 00:06:03.757
Oh, stop it! Wait, wait.
What is your first name?

75
00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.009
- It's Shonté.
- Bah!

76
00:06:06.635 --> 00:06:11.598
Shonté, I am... I am...
I am so<i>, so</i> sorry. I apologise.

77
00:06:11.681 --> 00:06:14.601
Oh, come on here.
Let me walk you to your car.

78
00:06:15.519 --> 00:06:18.563
I have no patience for people
who judge books by their cover.

79
00:06:18.647 --> 00:06:20.565
And you shouldn't have to!

80
00:06:20.649 --> 00:06:24.486
Treating me like a dumbshit!
I mean, who does he think he's talking to?

81
00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:27.405
I'm a professor
of molecular genetics at Brown.

82
00:06:27.489 --> 00:06:30.492
And I'm head of the Boston chapter of Mensa.

83
00:06:30.575 --> 00:06:32.702
- You're kidding?
- No.

84
00:06:32.786 --> 00:06:36.832
I'm just driving this limo
as a sociological experiment. That's it.

85
00:06:36.915 --> 00:06:41.211
But Mensa?
I-I'm president of the Providence chapter.

86
00:06:41.294 --> 00:06:43.296
No kidding.

87
00:06:49.302 --> 00:06:52.764
<i>Just when Charlie thought</i>
<i>life couldn't get any sweeter...</i>

88
00:06:52.848 --> 00:06:56.852
<i>... old Mr Stork dropped in</i>
<i>to pay him and Layla a visit.</i>

89
00:06:58.019 --> 00:07:00.689
It's a boy!

90
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:02.858
Oh...

91
00:07:02.941 --> 00:07:05.444
...boy, oy, oy.

92
00:07:07.446 --> 00:07:09.448
Wow!

93
00:07:10.532 --> 00:07:12.534
He's so...

94
00:07:14.536 --> 00:07:16.163
Wow!

95
00:07:16.246 --> 00:07:19.332
<i>- Pu-pu-pu...
- Pu? Pu?

96
00:07:19.416 --> 00:07:21.751
Whoa, you're in luck!

97
00:07:21.835 --> 00:07:24.671
- He's got company!
- Pu-pu-pu...

98
00:07:24.754 --> 00:07:27.507
- Argh! Argh!
- Push! Push!

99
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:33.138
<i>Charlie loved those boys so much,</i>
<i>he just couldn't face the truth.</i>

100
00:07:33.221 --> 00:07:36.850
<i>And so he went on with his life</i>
<i>as if everything was normal.</i>

101
00:07:39.895 --> 00:07:41.855
Hey, Finneran.

102
00:07:41.938 --> 00:07:43.940
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey!

103
00:07:44.441 --> 00:07:47.235
- Hope you brought your appetite with you.
- Oh, I did.

104
00:07:47.319 --> 00:07:51.072
- Charlie, your kids look great.
- Yeah, don't they? Thanks.

105
00:07:54.743 --> 00:07:56.703
Charlie...

106
00:07:56.787 --> 00:08:01.750
...just between you and me, d'you ever notice
that your kids have a year-round tan?

107
00:08:03.251 --> 00:08:04.753
Yeah, well...

108
00:08:04.836 --> 00:08:07.672
...uh, my great-grandmother's half-ltalian.

109
00:08:07.756 --> 00:08:09.758
- Half-ltalian?
- Oh, yeah.

110
00:08:10.717 --> 00:08:14.471
Well, that's probably why
the water beads off the hair, huh?

111
00:08:16.473 --> 00:08:21.728
Yeah, so? I mean, a lot of people
have different... kind of hair.

112
00:08:21.812 --> 00:08:24.648
- Oh, yeah.
- What are you... What are you getting at?

113
00:08:24.731 --> 00:08:26.942
Well, no, I'm just saying it's...

114
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:32.531
Come on, goddamn it! Those kids' dicks
are bigger than them sausages!

115
00:08:32.614 --> 00:08:35.325
Knock it off!
You're talking about my children.

116
00:08:35.408 --> 00:08:38.537
- Since you brought it up, I wanna ask...
- Finneran!

117
00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:41.123
Get over here. It's your turn.

118
00:08:46.002 --> 00:08:48.004
Charlie.

119
00:08:48.547 --> 00:08:52.050
Don't mind me.
It's just the beer talking, you know? Whoo!

120
00:08:53.677 --> 00:08:55.512
Sure.

121
00:09:01.518 --> 00:09:06.106
There's something... powerful
bubbling up inside me, Father.

122
00:09:07.065 --> 00:09:10.360
And I'm afraid that some day...

123
00:09:12.988 --> 00:09:15.866
...if I don't do something, I'm gonna explode.

124
00:09:18.994 --> 00:09:21.788
Where does this rage come from, my son?

125
00:09:21.872 --> 00:09:24.875
I don't know. It's a lot of things, really.

126
00:09:26.001 --> 00:09:28.003
Take my wife, for example.

127
00:09:28.086 --> 00:09:30.589
I love her like no other, but...

128
00:09:30.672 --> 00:09:34.342
...part of me suspects
that she may be having an affair.

129
00:09:34.426 --> 00:09:38.930
And I'm probably
just being paranoid here, but...

130
00:09:39.556 --> 00:09:44.895
...I get the feeling that the entire town
is laughing at me behind my back.

131
00:09:46.188 --> 00:09:48.482
Charlie, that you?

132
00:09:50.233 --> 00:09:53.945
<i>Eventually,</i>
<i>Charlie's worst fears were realised.</i>

133
00:09:54.029 --> 00:09:56.031
I'm so sorry, Charlie.

134
00:09:57.073 --> 00:09:59.618
Really, I am.

135
00:09:59.701 --> 00:10:01.870
But I have to do this.

136
00:10:01.953 --> 00:10:04.122
I found my soul mate.

137
00:10:04.915 --> 00:10:06.875
But...

138
00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.085
...I thought <i>I</i> was your soul mate.

139
00:10:10.003 --> 00:10:11.505
Oh.

140
00:10:11.838 --> 00:10:14.508
Come on, legs! Let's roll, baby.

141
00:10:16.635 --> 00:10:18.970
I don't know what to say.

142
00:10:19.054 --> 00:10:22.390
I guess the heartjust wants
what the heart wants.

143
00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:27.062
Bye, Charlie.

144
00:10:29.022 --> 00:10:31.900
But you said you'd eat whale blubber.

145
00:10:31.983 --> 00:10:36.321
She'll be eating blubber all right,
just as soon as I free willy.

146
00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:47.582
Oh.

147
00:10:51.628 --> 00:10:55.507
<i>It's funny how a man reacts</i>
<i>when his heart gets broken.</i>

148
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:58.385
<i>Some break down and cry like a baby.</i>

149
00:10:58.468 --> 00:11:01.680
<i>Others, they take out an Uzi</i>
<i>and climb a clock tower.</i>

150
00:11:01.763 --> 00:11:05.100
<i>But Charlie Baileygates</i>
<i>didn't seem to react at all.</i>

151
00:11:05.183 --> 00:11:11.064
<i>He just swallowed hard, felt that slab of</i>
<i>heartache slide over the lump in his throat...</i>

152
00:11:11.148 --> 00:11:13.608
<i>... and he locked it all away.</i>

153
00:11:18.029 --> 00:11:23.910
<i>As you can imagine, it wasn't easy for</i>
<i>little Jamaal, Lee Harvey and Shonté Junior...</i>

154
00:11:23.994 --> 00:11:26.037
<i>... growing up without a mom.</i>

155
00:11:26.121 --> 00:11:29.749
<i>But Charlie made that little house</i>
<i>into a big old home...</i>

156
00:11:29.833 --> 00:11:31.751
<i>... and the boys flourished.</i>

157
00:11:31.835 --> 00:11:35.046
<i>Let me tell you, they were smart ones.</i>

158
00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:38.758
- What are you building, fellas?
- An airplane, Daddy.

159
00:11:42.971 --> 00:11:44.931
B-b-b-bye-bye!

160
00:11:45.015 --> 00:11:48.268
Bye, Daddy!
Have a good time at work.

161
00:11:51.772 --> 00:11:53.774
Love you, Daddy!

162
00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:00.363
No. No!

163
00:12:00.572 --> 00:12:02.824
Hey, stop it!

164
00:12:02.908 --> 00:12:05.076
Get... Jamaal, you're in a lot of trouble!

165
00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.829
Get off that! Don't you take off in that!

166
00:12:09.915 --> 00:12:12.959
<i>How many seas must a white...</i>

167
00:12:13.043 --> 00:12:17.130
Shonté Junior, how can you keep
eating that crap and never gain weight?

168
00:12:17.214 --> 00:12:19.508
I don't know. Just lucky, I guess.

169
00:12:20.842 --> 00:12:26.515
<i>- How many times must the cannonball fly</i>
- Do you believe his voice?

170
00:12:26.598 --> 00:12:31.436
- That's Gomer Pyle!
<i>- Before they're forever banned?</i>

171
00:12:31.645 --> 00:12:34.314
Daddy, can we watch Richard Pryor on HBO?

172
00:12:35.565 --> 00:12:37.609
Richard Pryor?

173
00:12:37.692 --> 00:12:39.694
Pleee-ase.

174
00:12:39.778 --> 00:12:41.613
Okaay.

175
00:12:43.532 --> 00:12:46.618
<i>In Africa, though,</i>
<i>I go out in the country. Whoo.</i>

176
00:12:46.701 --> 00:12:50.705
<i>You see some lions and shit.</i>
<i>I'm talkin'about real lions.</i>

177
00:12:50.789 --> 00:12:53.792
<i>Not them kind you be fuckin' with in the zoo.</i>

178
00:12:53.875 --> 00:12:57.671
<i>You know how you go fuck with a lion?</i>
<i>"Hey, lion! Motherfucker!"</i>

179
00:12:59.631 --> 00:13:02.634
<i>Be throwin'shit at it. Lion'd be "Oh, ooh".</i>

180
00:13:02.717 --> 00:13:07.305
<i>As they have a way of doing,</i>
<i>the years passed somewhat regularly.</i>

181
00:13:07.389 --> 00:13:10.892
<i>And the boys, well, they came into their own.</i>

182
00:13:12.894 --> 00:13:16.231
<i>... is make her toss my salad!</i>

183
00:13:16.314 --> 00:13:19.192
<i>The guy's like "Toss my salad? What's that?"</i>

184
00:13:19.276 --> 00:13:25.657
<i>Having your salad tossed means having</i>
<i>your asshole eaten out with jelly or syrup.</i>

185
00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:27.451
<i>I prefer syrup.</i>

186
00:13:28.869 --> 00:13:30.871
He's a funny motherfucker!

187
00:13:35.584 --> 00:13:40.797
<i>Although Charlie's police work had</i>
<i>started to suffer, the kids were doing great.</i>

188
00:13:41.173 --> 00:13:46.094
Damn! I can't figure out the atomic mass
of this motherfuckin' deuteron.

189
00:13:46.178 --> 00:13:49.931
Shit. Man, that shit's simple. Lookit.

190
00:13:50.015 --> 00:13:52.184
- Tell me this, tell me this.
- What? What?

191
00:13:52.267 --> 00:13:54.603
What's a deuteron made up of?

192
00:13:54.686 --> 00:13:56.563
Duh! A proton and a neutron.

193
00:13:56.646 --> 00:14:00.859
Then what's this motherfuckin' electron
doin' right there?

194
00:14:00.942 --> 00:14:04.613
- Shit, I don't know.
- Well, get it out of there then!

195
00:14:04.696 --> 00:14:09.075
OK, so you're sayin' I add up the atomic
masses of the proton and the neutron, right?

196
00:14:09.159 --> 00:14:12.954
I sees that, but what do I do with
the goddamn electron? Can I put it here?

197
00:14:13.038 --> 00:14:16.833
Enrico Fermi'd roll over in his
motherfuckin' grave if he heard that.

198
00:14:16.917 --> 00:14:19.336
He'd just turn over ass up in yo' face.

199
00:14:19.419 --> 00:14:23.924
- Man, Jamaal. Just cut my man some slack.
- I'm just trying to help him save face.

200
00:14:24.007 --> 00:14:26.843
He keep askin' questions,
they'll think he's stupid.

201
00:14:26.927 --> 00:14:29.387
- I ain't stupid.
- Mornin', fellas.

202
00:14:29.471 --> 00:14:31.640
Hey, Pops, how you doin', man?

203
00:14:31.723 --> 00:14:35.268
- What's all the commotion?
- Oh, just school shit and shit.

204
00:14:35.352 --> 00:14:37.687
- How's my little guy doing?
- Struggling.

205
00:14:37.771 --> 00:14:41.942
Quantum physics is confusing. If I don't
buckle down, I'll get myself another B+.

206
00:14:42.025 --> 00:14:44.027
Oh, that'd be whack.

207
00:14:44.111 --> 00:14:47.364
He's so fucking dumb,
he thinks calculus is a goddamn emperor.

208
00:14:47.447 --> 00:14:48.907
Give it up, dawg.

209
00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:52.327
Well, you think polypeptide's
a motherfuckin' toothpaste.

210
00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:56.039
Oh, I gotta get out of here.
I don't wanna have to bust a cap.

211
00:14:57.332 --> 00:14:59.334
Kisses.

212
00:14:59.793 --> 00:15:02.129
Mwah, Daddy.

213
00:15:02.212 --> 00:15:04.464
- See ya later.
- Love ya.

214
00:15:05.298 --> 00:15:09.386
<i>Yeah, Charlie was getting</i>
<i>a lot of respect inside the house.</i>

215
00:15:09.469 --> 00:15:14.307
<i>But outside... Well, that was another story.</i>

216
00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:21.356
Mornin', Ed.

217
00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.233
Charlie.

218
00:15:23.733 --> 00:15:25.944
Ed, did you see where my paper went today?

219
00:15:26.278 --> 00:15:28.405
The wife's got it in the shitter.

220
00:15:30.407 --> 00:15:35.245
Well, could you... tell her to throw it
on the porch when she's done?

221
00:15:35.537 --> 00:15:38.206
Can't you get one at work?

222
00:15:41.793 --> 00:15:43.795
Yeah, I...

223
00:15:44.337 --> 00:15:46.339
...suppose I could.

224
00:15:46.423 --> 00:15:48.425
You betcha.

225
00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:37.891
- Hey, George, Herb.
- Hi, Charlie.

226
00:16:37.974 --> 00:16:40.143
- How do, fellas?
- Hi, Charlie.

227
00:16:40.769 --> 00:16:44.314
- Listen, Dick...
- Hey, guys, check out the rack on this one!

228
00:16:46.316 --> 00:16:52.155
- Whoa! Oh, yeah! That's what Daddy likes.
- It looks like a dead heat in a zeppelin race.

229
00:16:52.239 --> 00:16:55.784
- A couple of Hindenburgs, huh?
- Oh, the humanity!

230
00:16:55.867 --> 00:16:58.912
Come on, guys, take it easy. She's a mom.

231
00:17:07.337 --> 00:17:09.339
"She's a mom!"

232
00:17:10.882 --> 00:17:14.219
- She's a mom. Not my mom.
- She's a yummy mummy!

233
00:17:17.347 --> 00:17:19.349
You kill me!

234
00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.482
Sure, that is good.

235
00:17:30.527 --> 00:17:35.365
Listen, Dick,
I'm sorry to bother you like this but, uh...

236
00:17:35.824 --> 00:17:39.494
...uh, your-your-your car
is gonna have to be moved.

237
00:17:40.412 --> 00:17:44.875
Yeah, sure, Charlie. OK. I should be
done here in another 10 or 15 minutes.

238
00:17:46.585 --> 00:17:48.545
I hate to be a stickler, Dick...

239
00:17:48.628 --> 00:17:54.134
...but the law says you can't park in one place
for over an hour, and you've been there for...

240
00:17:55.594 --> 00:17:57.804
...going on three days now.

241
00:17:59.306 --> 00:18:01.683
All right, all right. The law's the law.

242
00:18:02.976 --> 00:18:06.271
Park it up behind the grocery store,
will ya, Charlie?

243
00:18:10.484 --> 00:18:12.486
Yeah, sure.

244
00:18:14.696 --> 00:18:16.698
This one?

245
00:18:16.782 --> 00:18:21.787
<i>There's an old saying: an ostrich</i>
<i>with his head in the sand makes a lousy cop.</i>

246
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:26.583
<i>You see, if you can't deal with your own</i>
<i>problems, well, it's hard to deal with others.</i>

247
00:18:26.666 --> 00:18:30.587
Sweetie? Sweetie? That's kinda dangerous.

248
00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:33.507
Wanna move it on to the sidewalk,
away from traffic?

249
00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:37.094
My dad says you're ajoke
and I don't have to listen to you.

250
00:18:41.098 --> 00:18:45.102
Well, your father is entitled to his opinion.

251
00:18:45.185 --> 00:18:48.563
But I am an officer of the law,
and, by all rights, I could...

252
00:18:48.647 --> 00:18:50.649
Fuck off!

253
00:18:50.732 --> 00:18:54.945
You should watch your mouth, little girl.

254
00:19:04.496 --> 00:19:06.498
Excuse me. Charlie!

255
00:19:06.581 --> 00:19:09.668
Hey! You mind if I get ahead of you?
I'm in a wicked rush.

256
00:19:09.751 --> 00:19:12.587
- Oh, yeah, sure. Go ahead.
- You're a doll.

257
00:19:12.671 --> 00:19:15.465
Hey, kids! Over here! Now!

258
00:19:18.343 --> 00:19:22.013
Didn't I tell you to stay with me?

259
00:20:04.556 --> 00:20:06.266
VagiClean, huh?

260
00:20:06.349 --> 00:20:09.936
What's the matter, honey?
Little extra cheese on the taco?

261
00:20:11.813 --> 00:20:13.982
- Excuse me?
- No, excuse <i>me.</i>

262
00:20:17.068 --> 00:20:19.070
There's no tag on this.

263
00:20:19.696 --> 00:20:21.656
Price check on VagiClean, aisle five.

264
00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:24.451
<i>I repeat: price check on VagiClean...</i>

265
00:20:24.534 --> 00:20:27.037
...aisle five. That's VagiClean.

266
00:20:27.537 --> 00:20:32.793
We got a customer with a fallopian fungus.
She's baking bread and I think it's sourdough.

267
00:20:37.172 --> 00:20:39.174
Put a rush on that.

268
00:20:40.759 --> 00:20:43.095
Hey, big guy. Did you hear the news?

269
00:20:43.178 --> 00:20:46.473
My son Billy
got the lead in the high-school musical.

270
00:20:46.556 --> 00:20:49.142
Well, I guess he likes the cock after all.

271
00:20:51.561 --> 00:20:52.854
Wha...

272
00:21:00.695 --> 00:21:04.491
- Still wanna skip rope in the street?
- I'll tell my daddy, Charlie!

273
00:21:04.574 --> 00:21:07.285
Wrong answer.
And the name's Hank, fuckface.

274
00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:58.378
There you go, Dick. I parked it for you.

275
00:21:59.296 --> 00:22:01.298
By the way...

276
00:22:04.259 --> 00:22:06.762
...you got a headlight out.

277
00:22:48.428 --> 00:22:51.139
Mm-mm! That looks good.

278
00:22:51.223 --> 00:22:54.726
- There you go, Colonel.
- Very good, Malcolm. Thank you.

279
00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:57.437
Colonel, something's wrong with Charlie.

280
00:22:57.521 --> 00:23:00.941
<i>- 1-X to 1-12.</i>
- 1-12 responding.

281
00:23:02.776 --> 00:23:07.906
<i>Of course, there's not much about this sort of</i>
<i>thing in the Rhode Island State Police manual.</i>

282
00:23:07.989 --> 00:23:12.661
<i>So they sent him up to Boston</i>
<i>to see a team of highly trained head doctors.</i>

283
00:23:12.744 --> 00:23:15.497
<i>They quickly identifjed the problem.</i>

284
00:23:16.206 --> 00:23:19.626
- You got a major screw loose.
- Huh?

285
00:23:19.709 --> 00:23:23.380
Doctors have diagnosed you
as having a "split personality".

286
00:23:23.463 --> 00:23:25.090
A schizo.

287
00:23:26.633 --> 00:23:30.137
- I don't remember this.
- That's because, according to that report...

288
00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:33.640
...it wasn't <i>you</i> that this was happening to.
It was this other guy.

289
00:23:33.723 --> 00:23:35.183
- Hank.
- Huh?

290
00:23:35.308 --> 00:23:38.812
- Said his name was Hank.
- And apparently Hank is trying to get out.

291
00:23:39.563 --> 00:23:42.858
Trying to get out? What do you mean
"get out"? How did he get <i>in?</i>

292
00:23:42.941 --> 00:23:47.195
- You created him.
- By not dealing with your problems, Charlie.

293
00:23:48.447 --> 00:23:51.324
Ever since, uh...

294
00:23:51.408 --> 00:23:55.787
Well, you know.
You've been avoiding confrontation.

295
00:23:55.871 --> 00:23:58.331
- But this guy inside.
- Hank.

296
00:23:58.415 --> 00:24:04.129
He doesn't. Doctors feel that you've created
this character out of necessity.

297
00:24:04.212 --> 00:24:06.756
You never stick up for yourself.

298
00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:10.552
Charlie, why didn't you take a vacation
when Layla left?

299
00:24:15.891 --> 00:24:17.684
Why-why would I?

300
00:24:17.768 --> 00:24:22.481
You know, I... Wives leave their husbands
every day in this country.

301
00:24:22.564 --> 00:24:25.192
That's no reason
to short-change the department.

302
00:24:25.275 --> 00:24:27.527
I mean, it's not like I had the flu...

303
00:24:36.453 --> 00:24:39.790
- Have you picked up your medication?
- Yes!

304
00:24:44.669 --> 00:24:49.549
I'm really not crazy about it, though.
It makes me so dry.

305
00:24:49.633 --> 00:24:53.929
You have to take it anyway. Dr Rabinowitz
assures us, if you do, everything'll be fine.

306
00:24:54.012 --> 00:24:56.723
This is a bunch of crap!

307
00:24:57.182 --> 00:25:00.519
No wonder you're the smallest state.
Little mind, little state.

308
00:25:00.602 --> 00:25:03.730
Shouldn't even be a state.
Should be a <i>district.</i>

309
00:25:03.814 --> 00:25:06.608
Can you take these goddamn things off?

310
00:25:06.691 --> 00:25:08.819
And could you stop lookin' at my ass!

311
00:25:10.821 --> 00:25:12.864
Pritchard, what's going on here?

312
00:25:12.948 --> 00:25:18.703
Well, uh, Colonel, her name's Waters, Irene P.
I pulled her over on 95 for a broken tail light.

313
00:25:18.787 --> 00:25:22.165
I ran a check. She's got
an outstanding warrant in New York.

314
00:25:22.582 --> 00:25:24.543
- Hit and run?
- Hit and run.

315
00:25:24.626 --> 00:25:26.962
Injured pedestrian signed the complaint.

316
00:25:27.045 --> 00:25:30.590
Oh, well, I think I might remember that.
That is ridiculous.

317
00:25:30.674 --> 00:25:33.343
I've never been in an accident.
Not in my whole life.

318
00:25:33.427 --> 00:25:37.264
Well, I've just gotten off the phone
with the New York State Patrol.

319
00:25:37.347 --> 00:25:40.350
They don't seem to think it's so ridiculous.

320
00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:46.356
- Look... How can we fix...
- Were you in Massena last Friday?

321
00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:50.193
Well, yeah, I live there.
But I didn't have any accident.

322
00:25:51.069 --> 00:25:54.322
I'm just driving down
to Block Island to see my sister.

323
00:25:54.614 --> 00:25:59.661
You seem like a nice guy. Is there any way
that you might let me handle this by mail or...

324
00:25:59.744 --> 00:26:03.248
Unfortunately, Miss Waters,
I'm not the one you have to convince.

325
00:26:03.331 --> 00:26:06.877
If there's been a mistake,
you have to clear it up in Massena.

326
00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:11.006
What? OK, wait,
because of somebody else's mistake...

327
00:26:11.089 --> 00:26:15.302
...I have to get in my car and
drive all the way back to upstate New York?

328
00:26:24.644 --> 00:26:26.646
No, ma'am.

329
00:26:27.939 --> 00:26:30.692
We'll have one of our troopers escort you.

330
00:26:34.654 --> 00:26:38.325
Hey, Hollywood, turn your fuckin' phone off.

331
00:26:38.408 --> 00:26:40.410
- Yeah?
<i>- You're an asshole.</i>

332
00:26:40.494 --> 00:26:42.454
Oh, hello, Irene. What'd I do now?

333
00:26:42.537 --> 00:26:45.290
Listen, I'm at a police station in Rhode Island.

334
00:26:45.373 --> 00:26:48.418
They're shipping me back to Massena
on some bogus crap.

335
00:26:48.502 --> 00:26:52.047
<i>- Sound familiar?</i>
- I don't have a clue what you're talkin' about.

336
00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:54.758
Dickie, cut the bullshit!

337
00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.764
Listen to me, OK?

338
00:27:00.847 --> 00:27:03.308
It's over, Dickie. It's over.

339
00:27:03.391 --> 00:27:09.106
So please just stop messing with me and call
your friends and tell them to back off, OK?

340
00:27:09.189 --> 00:27:11.191
<i>Look, I'm being a straight shooter.</i>

341
00:27:11.274 --> 00:27:16.571
If you need help, I'll help you. Just give me
all the details and I'll get to the bottom of it.

342
00:27:18.949 --> 00:27:22.077
Massena, New York!
Goddamn, Daddy! That's near Canada!

343
00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.788
I know, I know. Wasn't my idea.

344
00:27:24.871 --> 00:27:29.626
I gotta take this gal up north, and then the
colonel ordered me to take a week's vacation.

345
00:27:29.709 --> 00:27:31.920
A week's a long motherfuckin' time.

346
00:27:32.003 --> 00:27:35.424
He wants me to rest
while I'm getting used to the medication.

347
00:27:35.507 --> 00:27:39.845
Oh, come on. You don't have to worry
about us, Daddy. We're grown up now.

348
00:27:39.928 --> 00:27:42.514
These two can do the shopping.
I'll do the cooking.

349
00:27:42.597 --> 00:27:46.768
<i>You</i> do the cooking? Man, you thought
you got chipped beef from a toothy blow job!

350
00:27:46.893 --> 00:27:51.731
You're gonna have Shonté Junior
down or under goddamn 400lb. Fuck that.

351
00:27:51.815 --> 00:27:53.900
Can't have that happen. OK, guys.

352
00:27:55.652 --> 00:27:59.990
I'm not leaving till the morning, but
you know the rules: no bitches after eleven.

353
00:28:01.908 --> 00:28:03.702
- All right, Pops.
- Yeah, man.

354
00:28:03.785 --> 00:28:06.413
- Got you, Papa.
- Love you, Daddy!

355
00:28:09.207 --> 00:28:12.210
So who the hell's this Irene honey anyway?

356
00:28:12.878 --> 00:28:15.005
She worked for me the past two years.

357
00:28:15.505 --> 00:28:19.050
I hired her to be my golf-course
superintendent. We got close.

358
00:28:19.134 --> 00:28:21.136
No, you got stupid!

359
00:28:22.929 --> 00:28:27.809
For the love of shit, these are the loose ends
that can hang you, Dickie! And me too!

360
00:28:28.143 --> 00:28:32.355
- How much does she know?
- She might have gotten wind of some things.

361
00:28:32.647 --> 00:28:35.066
Yeah, well, we're gonna find out.

362
00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:37.819
The complaint was signed
by a guy named Peterson.

363
00:28:38.195 --> 00:28:43.116
- He's with the EPA.
- EPA? I thought they were in our pocket.

364
00:28:43.492 --> 00:28:45.827
Well, not all of 'em.

365
00:28:46.161 --> 00:28:50.499
<i>Even though Charlie didn't</i>
<i>wholeheartedly agree with the top brass...</i>

366
00:28:50.582 --> 00:28:52.584
<i>... he did as he was told.</i>

367
00:28:52.667 --> 00:28:55.545
- Careful on the road, Charlie.
- OK, Colonel.

368
00:29:00.634 --> 00:29:02.636
- Hang on, ma'am.
- Yeah.

369
00:29:11.269 --> 00:29:14.439
This vacation is just what Charlie needs.

370
00:29:14.523 --> 00:29:17.067
I bet he's a new man when he gets back.

371
00:29:18.235 --> 00:29:20.237
If we let him back.

372
00:29:21.863 --> 00:29:23.949
What do you mean?

373
00:29:24.032 --> 00:29:27.285
Well, I mean that
he's become a pretty big liability.

374
00:29:28.328 --> 00:29:30.789
We may have to let him go.

375
00:29:30.872 --> 00:29:34.584
Let him go? But, Captain,
police work is Charlie's whole li...

376
00:29:34.668 --> 00:29:36.670
I know, I know, damn it.

377
00:29:37.838 --> 00:29:39.172
I know.

378
00:29:45.387 --> 00:29:49.808
It's a great time of year to ride,
as long as you don't mind one or two bugs.

379
00:30:29.264 --> 00:30:31.850
Boy, you can't beat the open road!

380
00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:48.992
Oh, no.

381
00:30:49.075 --> 00:30:51.077
Oh, my goodness.

382
00:30:51.453 --> 00:30:53.121
Jeez.

383
00:30:54.289 --> 00:30:56.541
Those damn truckers.

384
00:30:56.625 --> 00:31:00.462
You know, you think
they'd call someone to come clean this up.

385
00:31:01.213 --> 00:31:04.299
Oh, poor thing. Oh, that's terrible.

386
00:31:04.382 --> 00:31:07.094
- Whew. Whoa!
- Ugh!

387
00:31:07.177 --> 00:31:10.347
By the looks of her,
she's been here for a while.

388
00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:14.226
Well, I doubt we're gonna be able
to move her, but we should try.

389
00:31:14.309 --> 00:31:16.269
You wanna get that end? Give it a push?

390
00:31:16.353 --> 00:31:19.272
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah, we should give it a shot.

391
00:31:19.981 --> 00:31:21.316
- OK?
- OK.

392
00:31:21.399 --> 00:31:24.236
Go ahead. Just push as hard as you can.

393
00:31:24.319 --> 00:31:26.321
Yeah, OK.

394
00:31:26.863 --> 00:31:28.865
- Oh! Ohh!
- Jesus! Holy...

395
00:31:30.158 --> 00:31:32.244
- OK...
- Ooh, it's still alive!

396
00:31:32.327 --> 00:31:36.706
- Just stand back. I'll take care of it.
- Oh, God! That's terrible.

397
00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:39.292
Oh. Now, don't look, OK?

398
00:31:39.376 --> 00:31:41.378
Yeah.

399
00:31:46.341 --> 00:31:48.343
Well, old girl.

400
00:31:49.261 --> 00:31:51.263
Your suffering's over.

401
00:31:58.895 --> 00:32:03.066
<i>Oh, it ain't always easy</i>
<i>doing Mother Nature's work.</i>

402
00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:06.862
Oh, Jesus.

403
00:32:07.279 --> 00:32:08.780
Oh.

404
00:32:14.035 --> 00:32:17.038
Oh. Do you believe that?

405
00:32:17.122 --> 00:32:19.166
No, it's... ugh.

406
00:32:19.249 --> 00:32:21.334
Oh, my God in heaven!

407
00:32:25.255 --> 00:32:28.175
God! What the hell is wrong with you?

408
00:32:28.258 --> 00:32:29.718
Die!

409
00:32:29.801 --> 00:32:33.388
Let go! Let go, girl!

410
00:32:33.472 --> 00:32:38.393
On to greener pastures, come on.
They're clear-cutting a place in heaven for ya.

411
00:32:38.477 --> 00:32:40.812
Come on! Help me out!

412
00:32:40.896 --> 00:32:42.773
- But...
- Do something!

413
00:32:42.856 --> 00:32:45.567
- I don't... oh...
- Let go!

414
00:32:47.402 --> 00:32:50.197
Let 'er go! Go!

415
00:32:55.243 --> 00:32:57.245
Oh!

416
00:33:00.582 --> 00:33:02.417
Well...

417
00:33:02.501 --> 00:33:04.628
...that was tough, but...

418
00:33:05.462 --> 00:33:07.631
...I think we did the right thing.

419
00:33:20.143 --> 00:33:22.896
Patrol car, yes. OK, thank you.

420
00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:27.984
- Can I help you?
- Baileygates, Rhode Island State Police.

421
00:33:28.068 --> 00:33:30.987
I have your prisoner, Miss Irene Waters, here.

422
00:33:31.947 --> 00:33:35.951
- All right. I'll tell them you're here.
- Okay-dee, ray-dee.

423
00:33:47.295 --> 00:33:49.840
- What are those for?
- Hm?

424
00:33:49.923 --> 00:33:52.968
Oh, it's just this... stupid thing.

425
00:33:53.051 --> 00:33:58.306
I have to take a pill every six hours
or I feel... funny. No big deal.

426
00:33:59.349 --> 00:34:01.351
What's it called?

427
00:34:01.435 --> 00:34:06.690
Advance delusionary schizophrenia
with involuntary narcissistic rage.

428
00:34:08.191 --> 00:34:10.193
Ah.

429
00:34:11.945 --> 00:34:13.947
Does your ass feel numb?

430
00:34:15.574 --> 00:34:17.576
No, but...

431
00:34:18.452 --> 00:34:20.954
...they give me unbelievable cottonmouth.

432
00:34:21.163 --> 00:34:24.499
- I meant from the ride.
- Oh. No, no.

433
00:34:24.583 --> 00:34:27.210
Over the years my ass has taken a pounding.

434
00:34:28.962 --> 00:34:33.300
Miss Waters, my name's Peterson.
This is my partner, Agent Boshane.

435
00:34:33.383 --> 00:34:37.304
We're with the Environmental
Protection Agency's Special Investigations.

436
00:34:37.387 --> 00:34:38.889
- The EPA?
- Yeah.

437
00:34:38.972 --> 00:34:41.183
What'd I hit? A baldheaded eagle?

438
00:34:41.558 --> 00:34:46.313
We'll explain that to you, ma'am, but right
now we're gonna ask you to come with us.

439
00:34:48.899 --> 00:34:52.027
Well, why don't you just
explain it to me now?

440
00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:57.991
We put your hit-and-run report
out on the wire in order to track you down.

441
00:34:59.117 --> 00:35:01.578
Track me down for what?

442
00:35:01.661 --> 00:35:03.663
Agent Boshane?

443
00:35:05.499 --> 00:35:09.586
I want to remind you again,
our station's at your disposal.

444
00:35:09.669 --> 00:35:12.214
You're welcome to use
our interrogation rooms.

445
00:35:12.297 --> 00:35:15.675
We appreciate it, Lieutenant Gerke,
but we're all set.

446
00:35:16.927 --> 00:35:19.846
Right. Well, if there's anything at all I...

447
00:35:32.025 --> 00:35:34.236
Uh, excuse me.

448
00:35:35.028 --> 00:35:37.447
I'm just gonna...

449
00:35:37.531 --> 00:35:40.033
...get myself a drink of water.

450
00:35:47.541 --> 00:35:53.463
Ah! So, if I could just get someone
to sign this, I'll be on my way.

451
00:35:53.672 --> 00:35:55.674
Yeah.

452
00:35:57.134 --> 00:36:01.054
Well, Miss Waters, good luck.
I hope everything works out great for you.

453
00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:03.974
Thanks a lot, Charlie.

454
00:36:04.724 --> 00:36:07.853
I haven't done anything wrong
and you know it.

455
00:36:09.438 --> 00:36:13.817
What about the marijuana roaches you left
when you moved out of your apartment?

456
00:36:14.609 --> 00:36:17.446
So I smoked some pot. What is that, a crime?

457
00:36:18.822 --> 00:36:20.115
Uh-huh.

458
00:36:20.198 --> 00:36:25.287
As is being an accessory to bribery,
embezzlement, tax evasion and racketeering.

459
00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:30.041
- What are you talking about?
- Does the name Dickie Thurman ring a bell?

460
00:36:31.209 --> 00:36:36.047
His company, Cedar Creek Limited,
has been under investigation for 18 months.

461
00:36:36.131 --> 00:36:40.302
How does that make me an accessory?
I laid sod on Dickie's golf course. So what?

462
00:36:40.385 --> 00:36:45.015
Tell me this. A big operation
like the Cedar Creek Country Club.

463
00:36:45.098 --> 00:36:49.227
- How'd you become the head greenskeeper?
- By default.

464
00:36:49.311 --> 00:36:54.357
This guy, um, Tedeschi or Tedesco,
he was hired before me, but he died.

465
00:36:54.691 --> 00:36:57.152
Heart problem or something.

466
00:36:58.695 --> 00:37:02.240
<i>The feds believed that Irene</i>
<i>knew more than she thought she knew...</i>

467
00:37:02.324 --> 00:37:04.618
<i>... and her life was in danger.</i>

468
00:37:04.701 --> 00:37:08.455
<i>They explained that everything</i>
<i>had been happening under her nose -</i>

469
00:37:08.538 --> 00:37:12.459
<i>... payoffs of government agencies,</i>
<i>threats to those who stood in the way.</i>

470
00:37:12.542 --> 00:37:18.632
<i>And her predecessor's heart attack?</i>
<i>Well, that was just cold-blooded murder.</i>

471
00:37:19.007 --> 00:37:21.009
Oh, man!

472
00:37:29.559 --> 00:37:31.561
Can you excuse me?

473
00:37:50.413 --> 00:37:52.666
Pizza kid.

474
00:37:55.252 --> 00:37:58.380
- How much?
- Uh, that comes to $13.95.

475
00:37:59.589 --> 00:38:00.799
Ooh!

476
00:38:23.530 --> 00:38:25.532
Oh, son of a bitch!

477
00:38:42.507 --> 00:38:44.801
<i>It was a good thing Charlie had told her...</i>

478
00:38:44.885 --> 00:38:49.389
<i>... he was staying at the Chuck E Cheese</i>
<i>Lodge and Miniature Golf Resort.</i>

479
00:38:49.973 --> 00:38:51.475
Charlie?

480
00:38:51.558 --> 00:38:55.854
<i>Irene finagled the key from the front desk</i>
<i>and let herself in.</i>

481
00:38:55.937 --> 00:38:57.939
Charlie!

482
00:39:07.866 --> 00:39:10.702
- Charlie, what's going on here?
- Hm?

483
00:39:10.786 --> 00:39:12.245
Irene?

484
00:39:12.329 --> 00:39:15.248
Oh! Oh, um...

485
00:39:15.332 --> 00:39:19.503
Irene, I was just, um...
I was gonna study your file...

486
00:39:19.586 --> 00:39:22.255
...and, uh, try to find a loophole.

487
00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:27.844
Did your lips get as chapped as mine
on the ride down?

488
00:39:27.928 --> 00:39:32.808
Never mind. I need your help. There was
a shootout at the thing. The agents are dead!

489
00:39:33.767 --> 00:39:36.561
- Dead?
- Yeah. They were after <i>me,</i> Charlie!

490
00:39:36.645 --> 00:39:39.689
Oh, God. See, this is Dickie's work. I know it!

491
00:39:43.485 --> 00:39:45.821
So what are you gonna do?

492
00:39:46.822 --> 00:39:49.616
- We'll call the police.
- What? No, you can't do that!

493
00:39:49.699 --> 00:39:53.161
Dickie has those guys in his back pocket.
That's why I came to you.

494
00:39:53.787 --> 00:39:57.707
- How... Wha...
- Oh, hey! This is serious shit!

495
00:39:57.791 --> 00:39:59.793
You don't...

496
00:40:00.252 --> 00:40:02.921
- I'm outta here.
- Hey, wait! No, don't do that!

497
00:40:03.004 --> 00:40:05.799
Come on, hold on.
Just let me think for a second. OK?

498
00:40:05.882 --> 00:40:09.553
Think someplace else.
This is the first place they're gonna look.

499
00:40:09.636 --> 00:40:11.638
Damn it!

500
00:40:19.062 --> 00:40:21.314
So where are we going anyway?

501
00:40:21.398 --> 00:40:23.400
You'll see.

502
00:40:24.609 --> 00:40:30.365
<i>Well, they went on the lam for a bit, and</i>
<i>then Charlie made a couple of phone calls.</i>

503
00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:42.252
Irene, take it easy now.

504
00:40:42.711 --> 00:40:45.672
- Charlie!
- Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

505
00:40:45.756 --> 00:40:47.674
Hey.

506
00:40:47.758 --> 00:40:49.843
- Good work, Baileygates.
- Thanks.

507
00:40:49.926 --> 00:40:53.138
- Sorry I had to meet you all the way out here.
- That's OK.

508
00:40:53.221 --> 00:40:55.474
It's just as well. Poor gal's paranoid.

509
00:40:55.557 --> 00:41:00.061
My kids are like that. They have this idea
that the cops are the bad guys... Ooh!

510
00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:10.906
Listen, I don't know what's going on
and I didn't tell the feds anything...

511
00:41:10.989 --> 00:41:14.701
Dickie told me you were street-smart. Huh?

512
00:41:14.785 --> 00:41:16.953
Why the hell would you run to this idiot?

513
00:41:22.876 --> 00:41:25.128
Drop the gun, moron.

514
00:41:25.212 --> 00:41:27.380
You're being video-taped.

515
00:41:28.757 --> 00:41:32.385
- What're you talking about?
- There's a camera on my bike.

516
00:41:36.389 --> 00:41:38.809
Hard to hit a moving target, isn't it?

517
00:41:41.144 --> 00:41:43.146
Ooh! Ow!

518
00:41:54.741 --> 00:41:57.160
Score. Good move.

519
00:41:57.536 --> 00:41:59.538
Get in the car.

520
00:42:00.789 --> 00:42:03.125
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on<i>:</i>

521
00:42:06.795 --> 00:42:09.589
D'you mind telling me
what you were thinking?

522
00:42:09.798 --> 00:42:12.384
Calling that cop was unbelievably stupid!

523
00:42:12.467 --> 00:42:14.511
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

524
00:42:15.762 --> 00:42:18.640
Tweak the high end
on your emotional EQ, sweetbeak.

525
00:42:18.723 --> 00:42:21.226
The funky chicken was Charlie's dance.

526
00:42:21.309 --> 00:42:23.895
I'm a tango man myself.

527
00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:29.609
Grr!

528
00:42:29.693 --> 00:42:33.321
<i>As you can imagine,</i>
<i>there was some explaining to do.</i>

529
00:42:33.405 --> 00:42:36.825
<i>So Hank, as he called himself...</i>

530
00:42:36.908 --> 00:42:41.329
<i>... found a quiet spot</i>
<i>and spelled out the whole darn mess.</i>

531
00:42:41.413 --> 00:42:44.708
OK, so what you're saying
is that you're not Charlie.

532
00:42:45.375 --> 00:42:49.254
You've seen Charlie in action.
He's like origami: folds under pressure.

533
00:42:49.337 --> 00:42:52.716
When the big game's on the line,
he's busy riding the pine.

534
00:42:53.675 --> 00:42:55.677
OK, wait, wait. Can you just...?

535
00:43:00.515 --> 00:43:02.517
It's simple.

536
00:43:02.976 --> 00:43:07.981
Charlie's the mouse that got you into
the maze. I'm the rat who can find the cheese.

537
00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:11.860
The name's Hank. Hank Evans...

538
00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:18.909
So it's true. Charlie <i>is</i> a schizo.

539
00:43:18.992 --> 00:43:23.246
I wouldn't know. I stay out of his business,
he stays out of mine.

540
00:43:23.663 --> 00:43:25.499
Look.

541
00:43:28.210 --> 00:43:31.588
Just because I rock
doesn't mean I'm made of stone.

542
00:43:31.671 --> 00:43:36.176
I feel your fear. It's coming through
like static on my heart radio.

543
00:43:38.553 --> 00:43:40.555
Hank? Hank.

544
00:43:42.099 --> 00:43:45.102
I really, really appreciate your help...

545
00:43:45.185 --> 00:43:51.858
...but is there any way that maybe we could
get... Charlie back out here for a little huddle?

546
00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:57.114
No problem. While you're at it, why not climb
that pole and take a piss on the power lines?

547
00:43:57.197 --> 00:43:59.991
Look, I'm not here to twist your niblets.

548
00:44:00.075 --> 00:44:05.247
I'm here to save your life, but if I'm gonna
do that, I'll need total <i>uninononynymity.</i>

549
00:44:10.836 --> 00:44:12.212
OK.

550
00:44:12.963 --> 00:44:15.173
Sound good, candypants?

551
00:44:15.757 --> 00:44:17.384
Hank, don't call me that.

552
00:44:29.813 --> 00:44:32.149
How the hell can they call Pluto a planet?

553
00:44:32.232 --> 00:44:36.445
What motherfuckin' planet has an
elliptical orbit? This shit don't make sense.

554
00:44:37.028 --> 00:44:41.575
Motherfucker! That motherfucker Vince
Foster <i>was</i> murdered. I told you that shit!

555
00:44:42.075 --> 00:44:45.120
Hey, man, quit hackin' into
them goddamn Pentagon files.

556
00:44:45.203 --> 00:44:49.750
Ain't no nevermind who them crooked
politicians be killin'. You need to study.

557
00:44:50.083 --> 00:44:52.919
- What did Daddy tell you about snoopin'?
- Shit, yeah.

558
00:44:53.003 --> 00:44:56.423
If you keep fuckin' around,
you'll lose your Yale scholarship.

559
00:44:56.506 --> 00:45:01.052
Be stuck up there at Stanford with
them goddamn motherfuckers.

560
00:45:01.678 --> 00:45:05.640
Motherfucker, you be lucky to get
accepted to Duke, gettin' a 1430 on yo' SAT.

561
00:45:05.724 --> 00:45:08.351
- Motherfucker, you know I had the flu.
- Flu, my ass!

562
00:45:08.435 --> 00:45:11.229
You had a motherfuckin' aneurysm
to get a 1430.

563
00:45:11.313 --> 00:45:13.982
Hey, you talkin' some shit now.

564
00:45:14.065 --> 00:45:17.486
That's probably one of them
lvy League sons of bitches now.

565
00:45:17.569 --> 00:45:20.238
Show me yo' ass head up
and get the door, man.

566
00:45:23.617 --> 00:45:25.410
Hey, Captain.

567
00:45:25.494 --> 00:45:27.871
- Fellas.
- What the fuck is goin' on, man?

568
00:45:28.663 --> 00:45:31.500
- This is Agent Annicelli.
- Gentlemen.

569
00:45:32.209 --> 00:45:34.503
- What's happenin'?
- We've got a problem.

570
00:45:35.170 --> 00:45:37.005
Pack your bags.

571
00:45:42.928 --> 00:45:44.763
- We're locked and loaded.
- Great.

572
00:45:44.846 --> 00:45:47.182
Got enough stuff to hold us over for 72 hours.

573
00:46:01.905 --> 00:46:03.907
Well, fuck my ozone.

574
00:46:31.184 --> 00:46:32.853
Hey, ringworm.

575
00:46:36.022 --> 00:46:39.067
Yeah, I'm talkin' to you,
you toxic waste of life.

576
00:46:40.694 --> 00:46:42.487
You gonna pick up that butt?

577
00:46:42.571 --> 00:46:46.032
Or do I have to glue it to my shoe
and stick it in your pimply a-hole?

578
00:46:46.533 --> 00:46:50.287
Hey, man. Take it easy. It's just a cigarette.

579
00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:52.789
Oh, yeah?

580
00:46:52.873 --> 00:46:58.128
Well, this is just a fist, but when I throw it
around, it can leave one hell of a mess.

581
00:46:58.211 --> 00:47:00.046
Let's dance.

582
00:47:18.106 --> 00:47:19.566
Hey! Hey!

583
00:47:22.110 --> 00:47:27.491
- Let's kick the shit out of this crazy asshole!
- Wait! Wait! Wait, he's a schizo!

584
00:47:27.574 --> 00:47:30.535
What the hell's wrong with him?

585
00:47:32.662 --> 00:47:35.040
What happened anyway?

586
00:47:35.123 --> 00:47:39.586
<i>Yeah, Charlie was taking a few lumps</i>
<i>on account of Hank's behaviour.</i>

587
00:47:39.669 --> 00:47:44.674
<i>But, save for a little blood in the urine,</i>
<i>he was no worse for the wear.</i>

588
00:47:46.343 --> 00:47:49.346
I'm sorry you had to meet Hank, Miss Waters.

589
00:47:49.429 --> 00:47:51.556
I thought <i>I</i> was bad.

590
00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:54.184
That guy has some serious problems.

591
00:47:55.477 --> 00:47:57.979
He did save our lives.

592
00:47:59.981 --> 00:48:03.985
- Anyway, Hank had a good idea. He thinks...
- You're gonna listen to Hank?

593
00:48:04.319 --> 00:48:08.824
Come on, look what he did to me!
What are you thinking? He's out of control.

594
00:48:10.784 --> 00:48:15.664
You know what we should do? Find another
department and tell them the whole story.

595
00:48:16.289 --> 00:48:20.377
Not smart, Charlie.
We don't know how far Dickie's reach goes.

596
00:48:22.295 --> 00:48:24.297
Then you know what?

597
00:48:24.381 --> 00:48:28.885
I think it's time to call the best damn
law enforcement agency in the country.

598
00:48:28.969 --> 00:48:31.096
The Rhode Island State Troopers!

599
00:48:31.179 --> 00:48:35.892
Do you really think that the feds don't have
some guy up there right now bugging calls?

600
00:48:35.976 --> 00:48:41.189
They'd be on us in ten minutes. And
they almost got me killed in the first place.

601
00:48:41.815 --> 00:48:43.358
OK.

602
00:48:43.442 --> 00:48:45.861
What was the genius's big plan?

603
00:48:45.944 --> 00:48:49.281
He thinks that we should find a cabin
and hide out for a while.

604
00:48:49.364 --> 00:48:51.741
Oh, yeah? What about water and food and...

605
00:48:51.825 --> 00:48:54.786
He already got supplies. They're in the trunk.

606
00:49:05.046 --> 00:49:07.424
- These are the supplies?
- Mm-hm.

607
00:49:10.802 --> 00:49:13.930
Well, he had a plan, all right.

608
00:49:14.306 --> 00:49:16.892
That's it? That's all he got?

609
00:49:16.975 --> 00:49:18.977
Oh, no. There's more.

610
00:49:19.978 --> 00:49:21.480
A rope...

611
00:49:21.563 --> 00:49:23.565
...shovel...

612
00:49:24.274 --> 00:49:27.235
...bag of lime and some lawn darts.

613
00:49:30.238 --> 00:49:33.700
This is Christine DiCarlo
live from Clinton County, New York...

614
00:49:33.784 --> 00:49:37.829
...where the manhunt continues for
Rhode Island State Trooper Baileygates.

615
00:49:37.913 --> 00:49:41.833
...responsible for the death of an EPA agent
and the kidnapping of Irene Waters.

616
00:49:41.917 --> 00:49:46.421
Bullshit! My daddy ain't killed nobody
and he sure ain't kidnapped no bitch!

617
00:49:46.505 --> 00:49:49.716
Your dad's sick, mentally.
He's had a breakdown.

618
00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:53.095
The important thing is we find him
so nobody else gets hurt.

619
00:49:53.470 --> 00:49:57.641
- Nobody's gonna get hurt.
- Our daddy wouldn't hurt a motherfuckin' fly.

620
00:49:57.891 --> 00:50:03.105
No, he goes after bigger game. We just got
a report he put six bullets into a cow's head.

621
00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:05.774
Poor thing's lucky to be alive.

622
00:50:07.943 --> 00:50:13.031
OK, look, let's say he does have a problem -
which he don't. He's been takin' pills.

623
00:50:13.115 --> 00:50:17.077
- He left his pills in the hotel room.
- That's where he left his sanity.

624
00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:20.747
I've seen it first-hand.
The guy's nuttier than squirrel turds.

625
00:50:20.831 --> 00:50:24.543
- One thing I don't understand... <i>Lieutenant.</i>
- Mm?

626
00:50:24.626 --> 00:50:28.380
If my daddy's such a scary-ass motherfucker,
why'd you go by yourself?

627
00:50:28.463 --> 00:50:31.967
Who the fuck are you? Sergeant York
taking on the Germans yourself?

628
00:50:32.175 --> 00:50:35.387
Your father's a police officer.
He asked me to come alone.

629
00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:38.807
- How was I to know he's a nutcase?
- He ain't no fuckin' nutcase!

630
00:50:38.890 --> 00:50:43.019
He may have delusionary schizophrenia
with involuntary narcissistic rage...

631
00:50:43.103 --> 00:50:45.689
...but he is a very gentle person.

632
00:50:54.156 --> 00:50:57.576
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's the fuss? Tell me what's happenin'.

633
00:50:57.659 --> 00:51:03.165
Stay away from me, Hank! I know what you
had planned. I saw your so-called supplies.

634
00:51:04.458 --> 00:51:06.042
Oh.

635
00:51:06.126 --> 00:51:08.128
That.

636
00:51:08.628 --> 00:51:12.007
I wasn't gonna just ram it home... though.

637
00:51:12.090 --> 00:51:14.301
I was gonna... lube it up...

638
00:51:14.384 --> 00:51:17.763
...and ease it in there inch by inch...
like a gentleman.

639
00:51:17.846 --> 00:51:21.558
I was talking about the shovel and the lime.

640
00:51:21.641 --> 00:51:24.102
Shovel and lime?

641
00:51:32.235 --> 00:51:35.530
Thank you.
I haven't laughed like that in a long time.

642
00:51:35.614 --> 00:51:37.199
What's so funny?

643
00:51:37.282 --> 00:51:40.118
- We're driving a hot carriage.
- So?

644
00:51:40.202 --> 00:51:42.412
That stuff belongs to the bad cop.

645
00:51:42.496 --> 00:51:46.416
You think he was gonna take
our dead bodies down to the station?

646
00:51:47.375 --> 00:51:49.377
Oh.

647
00:51:53.882 --> 00:51:59.471
<i>Irene decided they should go back</i>
<i>to Rhode Island, but Hank had an idea first.</i>

648
00:51:59.554 --> 00:52:01.973
Are you sure about this?

649
00:52:02.057 --> 00:52:06.103
You kidding? Every oinker east of the
Mississippi will be looking for this sled.

650
00:52:06.186 --> 00:52:07.979
Safer to go mass transit.

651
00:52:08.063 --> 00:52:10.148
Ready? On nine.

652
00:52:10.232 --> 00:52:11.900
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

653
00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:30.585
Well, they won't be tracking us in that car.

654
00:52:30.669 --> 00:52:32.963
- Thanks for the kudos.
- Sure.

655
00:52:33.046 --> 00:52:35.882
- Glad we're finally on the same page.
- Me, too.

656
00:52:35.966 --> 00:52:37.968
Whoa!

657
00:52:38.677 --> 00:52:40.554
- You OK?
- Yes...

658
00:52:40.637 --> 00:52:42.639
...l'm fine.

659
00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:46.143
Thought you were going over the edge.

660
00:52:46.226 --> 00:52:48.228
Thank you.

661
00:52:52.023 --> 00:52:54.734
You know, I think you're a very special unit.

662
00:52:54.818 --> 00:52:56.319
That's sweet.

663
00:52:56.736 --> 00:52:59.531
I hope we can get to know each other better.

664
00:52:59.614 --> 00:53:01.450
Yeah. Me too.

665
00:53:01.783 --> 00:53:03.618
Do you swallow?

666
00:53:07.456 --> 00:53:09.916
I get it. We'll go slow.

667
00:53:16.548 --> 00:53:18.550
- Hey!
- Yes?

668
00:53:19.593 --> 00:53:23.513
You didn't happen
to pick up a wallet on the dash, did you?

669
00:53:23.597 --> 00:53:25.807
You're kidding, right?

670
00:53:28.977 --> 00:53:31.480
So what's your tale? Where you from?

671
00:53:31.563 --> 00:53:33.690
Oh, all over.

672
00:53:33.774 --> 00:53:36.902
Omnipresence. I like that in a woman.

673
00:53:36.985 --> 00:53:40.363
I'm originally from Texas.
Middle-class neighbourhood.

674
00:53:40.447 --> 00:53:42.908
But after school I moved to New York cos...

675
00:53:42.991 --> 00:53:47.621
Let me guess. Everybody said you were easy
on the eyes, so you tried to become a model.

676
00:53:47.704 --> 00:53:52.542
But in the Big Apple, they treated you
like the worm, so you became an actress.

677
00:53:52.626 --> 00:53:54.628
- Uh, no.
- Sh!

678
00:53:55.545 --> 00:53:57.714
But you can't get far without talent...

679
00:53:57.798 --> 00:54:01.968
...and the only bright lights you saw
were the ones inside the fridge.

680
00:54:02.052 --> 00:54:06.056
So you got a boob job and went
looking for a rich man with a bum ticker...

681
00:54:06.139 --> 00:54:10.060
...and waved a white flag
in the face of your own self-loathing.

682
00:54:12.729 --> 00:54:15.649
- How's my aim?
- I never went to New York City.

683
00:54:15.732 --> 00:54:19.569
I went to Cornell, then I got my master's
in Turf Management at U-Mass.

684
00:54:19.694 --> 00:54:22.197
Then I became a golf-course superintendent.

685
00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:28.370
- And these are all mine.
- I notice you left out your eating disorder.

686
00:54:28.453 --> 00:54:30.997
- I don't have an eating disorder.
- Whatever, slim.

687
00:54:36.837 --> 00:54:38.839
- Whoa!
- Hands off, Hank.

688
00:54:47.597 --> 00:54:49.266
Hey!

689
00:54:49.349 --> 00:54:50.976
Mom!

690
00:54:51.059 --> 00:54:55.272
That's real nice, Hank.
Way to keep a low profile.

691
00:54:55.355 --> 00:54:57.357
It's survival at this point.

692
00:54:59.609 --> 00:55:02.237
Hey, I know how to score some dough.

693
00:55:03.697 --> 00:55:05.699
- Punch me.
- What?!

694
00:55:05.782 --> 00:55:07.826
- Punch me in the face.
- Why?

695
00:55:07.909 --> 00:55:10.787
I'll tell the big cheese
I got rolled in the parking lot.

696
00:55:10.871 --> 00:55:14.791
He'll hush me with some Benjamins.
They don't need that kind of ink.

697
00:55:14.875 --> 00:55:17.002
Come on, rip my head off.

698
00:55:17.085 --> 00:55:21.214
- That's really lame, Hank.
- You have a better idea? Come on!

699
00:55:21.798 --> 00:55:24.843
- It's not gonna work.
- Yes, it is, but you gotta rock me.

700
00:55:24.926 --> 00:55:28.346
Don't give me a girly
"I don't want to break a fingernail" tap.

701
00:55:28.430 --> 00:55:31.433
This guy's gotta look at my face
and just... Argh!

702
00:55:36.021 --> 00:55:39.733
<i>Well, the kick in the chops</i>
<i>didn't work out as planned.</i>

703
00:55:39.816 --> 00:55:42.903
<i>It just left Charlie a little more roughed up.</i>

704
00:55:42.986 --> 00:55:44.696
How's the nose feeling?

705
00:55:44.780 --> 00:55:46.782
Listen to it.

706
00:55:48.492 --> 00:55:52.496
- I'm really sorry, Charlie.
- I'll get over it.

707
00:55:53.497 --> 00:55:57.292
I mean, you should be furious.
I just drop-kicked you right in the face.

708
00:55:57.375 --> 00:55:59.419
Hey, it happens.

709
00:56:02.631 --> 00:56:07.010
You got a great way of looking at life, Charlie.
You know that? That's a gift.

710
00:56:07.094 --> 00:56:11.348
Yeah, I don't know if my shrinks would agree.
They think that's my problem.

711
00:56:11.431 --> 00:56:12.933
What?

712
00:56:13.016 --> 00:56:19.481
Ah, that I purposely distort my perceptions
to make my reality more palatable.

713
00:56:20.607 --> 00:56:23.735
Like you only hear what you wanna hear?

714
00:56:23.819 --> 00:56:27.447
Thanks. I like to keep it short,
especially in the summer.

715
00:56:30.951 --> 00:56:36.123
How come I couldn't have ended up with
an easy-going guy like you, Charlie? Huh?

716
00:56:36.206 --> 00:56:40.961
Sometimes I think there's something about
my look thatjust attracts assholes.

717
00:56:41.044 --> 00:56:44.923
That's crazy.
You're a very special girl, Irene. Look at you.

718
00:56:45.006 --> 00:56:46.842
You're just so down-to-earth.

719
00:56:46.925 --> 00:56:50.387
I mean, look at your hair.
It's like you don't give a damn.

720
00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:55.684
And you let your skin hang out, blemishes
an' all. You're not afraid of your flaws.

721
00:56:55.767 --> 00:56:59.312
Your face is all pursed up
like you just sucked on a lemon...

722
00:56:59.396 --> 00:57:01.231
...but you pull it off!

723
00:57:10.699 --> 00:57:12.909
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

724
00:57:13.952 --> 00:57:16.288
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah.

725
00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:22.502
Come on!

726
00:57:23.211 --> 00:57:26.423
- I don't know if I can!
- Yes, you can!

727
00:57:26.506 --> 00:57:29.050
Humans only use 10% of their potential!

728
00:57:29.134 --> 00:57:32.554
You gotta reach down
for that little extra something!

729
00:57:34.681 --> 00:57:37.309
There you go!

730
00:57:38.226 --> 00:57:40.437
Now you're gettin' it!

731
00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:42.189
I believe in you!

732
00:57:43.523 --> 00:57:45.525
Don't you give up on me now!

733
00:57:51.531 --> 00:57:54.534
Easier than I thought! Come on!

734
00:57:55.160 --> 00:57:58.080
Go, Charlie. Go! You can do it!

735
00:57:58.163 --> 00:57:59.956
Come on, Charlie!

736
00:58:00.123 --> 00:58:02.751
Use more of your potential!

737
00:58:10.092 --> 00:58:11.927
Come on, Charlie! Go!

738
00:58:12.219 --> 00:58:13.887
Jump off!

739
00:58:13.970 --> 00:58:16.098
- What?
- Jump off!

740
00:58:16.932 --> 00:58:18.266
What?

741
00:58:18.934 --> 00:58:21.394
Jump off the train!

742
00:58:21.812 --> 00:58:23.480
Oh...

743
00:58:25.065 --> 00:58:26.733
Argh!

744
00:58:28.819 --> 00:58:30.821
- Ow.
- Irene?

745
00:58:32.155 --> 00:58:34.783
Come on. Stop fooling around.

746
00:58:36.660 --> 00:58:39.496
I started thinking about it. Bad idea.

747
00:58:39.579 --> 00:58:42.582
Trains are the first place they'll look.

748
00:58:43.208 --> 00:58:45.710
Oh, come on.

749
00:58:45.794 --> 00:58:49.923
We checked all the gas and food stops
along the interstate. No sign of 'em.

750
00:58:50.006 --> 00:58:52.801
Interstate! Is your old lady happy?

751
00:58:54.010 --> 00:58:55.846
My old lady?

752
00:58:55.929 --> 00:59:00.642
Cos if your fuckin' is like your police work,
you couldn't hit the G spot on a 12lb pussy.

753
00:59:00.725 --> 00:59:03.770
Watch yourself.

754
00:59:04.646 --> 00:59:08.233
- What are you gettin' at?
- Look, Daddy ain't gonna take no road...

755
00:59:08.316 --> 00:59:11.236
...where y'all blind-ass cops is lookin'.

756
00:59:11.319 --> 00:59:14.156
And, motherfucker, he don't eat fast food.

757
00:59:16.825 --> 00:59:19.536
OK, I have three dollars.
How much do you have?

758
00:59:19.619 --> 00:59:22.706
- Um, six bucks.
- Let me just go up and order, so we can go.

759
00:59:22.789 --> 00:59:26.418
OK. I'll have a chicken breast sandwich.
No skin, dry toast.

760
00:59:52.861 --> 00:59:57.282
What are you starin' at, fucker?

761
00:59:57.365 --> 00:59:59.993
Wanna start me up? Just pull the cord, pal.

762
01:00:00.077 --> 01:00:03.497
I'm due for a seismic event.
You're dancin' on the fault line.

763
01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:08.418
- Hey, what is your problem, pal?
- I got no beef with you. Just the kid.

764
01:00:08.877 --> 01:00:11.713
- Hey, stop it!
- He started it.

765
01:00:11.797 --> 01:00:14.758
I'm so sorry. I apologise.
He suffers from this thing.

766
01:00:14.841 --> 01:00:17.219
I'm standing right here, four-eyes.

767
01:00:17.302 --> 01:00:21.681
Oh, poor baby. Has to let his daddy
fight his battles for him, huh?

768
01:00:21.765 --> 01:00:23.850
He's an ass.

769
01:00:30.232 --> 01:00:32.234
Pussy.

770
01:00:36.905 --> 01:00:39.032
How's it hangin', fellas?

771
01:00:39.116 --> 01:00:41.451
Hank, I presume.

772
01:00:42.327 --> 01:00:44.287
D'you miss me?

773
01:00:44.371 --> 01:00:48.750
Why don't you get Charlie back?
Things were finally becoming civilised.

774
01:00:48.834 --> 01:00:52.421
Unless you put your ear to the ground,
you'll never hear the buffalo.

775
01:00:52.504 --> 01:00:54.714
I don't know what that means, OK?

776
01:00:55.048 --> 01:01:00.137
It means either he makes up a battle plan,
or Hank'll take over Fort Charlie for good.

777
01:01:01.346 --> 01:01:04.307
Did you just refer to yourself
in the fourth person?

778
01:01:04.558 --> 01:01:07.727
Holy Jesus in heaven! It's a giant Q-Tip.

779
01:01:07.811 --> 01:01:09.146
Hank!

780
01:01:09.229 --> 01:01:12.649
What? I'm jokin'.
Bringin' a little sunshine into his life.

781
01:01:12.732 --> 01:01:14.901
Careful, you'll peel.

782
01:01:14.985 --> 01:01:19.156
- Uh, do you need to see a menu?
- No, thank you. We've ordered.

783
01:01:25.370 --> 01:01:28.206
- That's it.
- Hey, hey, hey!

784
01:01:28.290 --> 01:01:32.210
- Hold on, cheese tits. Did I miss something?
- Don't give me that shit!

785
01:01:32.294 --> 01:01:35.005
What you just did to that kid was terrible.

786
01:01:35.088 --> 01:01:37.674
Didn't you see the look on his face?

787
01:01:40.343 --> 01:01:42.637
Looked a little pale, that's all.

788
01:01:42.721 --> 01:01:45.307
He was hurt... and offended.

789
01:01:45.390 --> 01:01:47.851
Well, I disagree, but why speculate?

790
01:01:48.810 --> 01:01:51.772
- Hey, Milky! <i>Vámonos!</i>
- Hey, no! No, no, no! Hey, no!

791
01:01:51.855 --> 01:01:55.984
Come on, Br'er Rabbit.
Hop down the bunny trail. <i>Epa, epa, ándale.</i>

792
01:01:57.110 --> 01:02:02.157
Listen, uh... were you offended in any way
by our social interaction here?

793
01:02:02.657 --> 01:02:04.493
Y-yeah, actually I was.

794
01:02:07.287 --> 01:02:09.122
What was it? The Q-Tip thing?

795
01:02:09.206 --> 01:02:12.876
Actually I was pretty much offended
by everything you said, sir.

796
01:02:14.169 --> 01:02:15.796
Oh.

797
01:02:20.425 --> 01:02:22.427
Sorry.

798
01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:27.557
I'm truly sorry.

799
01:02:49.037 --> 01:02:51.039
You OK?

800
01:02:53.458 --> 01:02:55.460
You don't know what it was like.

801
01:02:55.544 --> 01:02:59.423
Spending all those years
trapped behind a wall of politeness.

802
01:02:59.506 --> 01:03:01.508
Bound and gagged...

803
01:03:02.342 --> 01:03:06.263
...in a dark and silent world
where nothing grows but the anger.

804
01:03:09.474 --> 01:03:14.438
All because some demon he married laced up
her boots and did a Nancy Sinatra on him.

805
01:03:14.521 --> 01:03:16.857
Charlie had a wife?

806
01:03:17.941 --> 01:03:20.360
And then some.

807
01:03:20.444 --> 01:03:23.488
I was a big piece
of the personality pie back then.

808
01:03:23.572 --> 01:03:26.616
But when she left him, Charlie went numb...

809
01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:28.577
...and I went AWOL.

810
01:03:29.369 --> 01:03:31.371
Well...

811
01:03:32.497 --> 01:03:35.542
...if you were
such a big part of the personality...

812
01:03:36.293 --> 01:03:38.295
...then she left you too.

813
01:03:47.095 --> 01:03:49.097
It's true.

814
01:03:51.516 --> 01:03:54.561
<i>She left us.</i>

815
01:03:56.563 --> 01:03:58.565
I... loved her.

816
01:03:59.149 --> 01:04:01.067
Oh.

817
01:04:01.151 --> 01:04:03.487
Why'd she do this?

818
01:04:04.446 --> 01:04:06.740
I'm not a bad person.

819
01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:10.535
I'm not a bad person.

820
01:04:11.536 --> 01:04:14.039
No, no, you're not a bad guy.

821
01:04:14.122 --> 01:04:16.291
No, you're not.

822
01:04:16.374 --> 01:04:18.210
D'you hear me? Huh?

823
01:04:22.255 --> 01:04:24.591
You're a good person.

824
01:04:28.428 --> 01:04:30.597
You really think so?

825
01:04:31.848 --> 01:04:34.184
Yeah, I'm starting to.

826
01:04:44.194 --> 01:04:46.363
- You know what I'm gonna do?
- Hm?

827
01:04:47.030 --> 01:04:49.366
I'm gonna make it up to Charlie.

828
01:04:49.950 --> 01:04:54.121
And I'm gonna make it up
to that sweet little circus geek in there.

829
01:04:54.204 --> 01:04:55.872
Um...

830
01:04:56.540 --> 01:04:58.625
Um, Hank?

831
01:04:58.708 --> 01:04:59.876
Hank!

832
01:05:00.168 --> 01:05:05.006
Agent Boshane! They were spotted leaving
a health-food restaurant 100 miles from here.

833
01:05:05.090 --> 01:05:07.259
- 15 minutes, tops.
- Got it. Got it.

834
01:05:14.516 --> 01:05:16.810
They got 150 cordoned off?

835
01:05:18.270 --> 01:05:20.272
Let's fly!

836
01:05:39.541 --> 01:05:42.419
Can you please tell him to stop this?

837
01:05:42.502 --> 01:05:44.796
Charlie, is that you?

838
01:05:48.675 --> 01:05:50.677
Hey, my nose.

839
01:05:51.553 --> 01:05:54.222
My nose is fixed.

840
01:05:55.932 --> 01:05:59.519
- Isn't that great?
- How'd that happen?

841
01:05:59.603 --> 01:06:04.316
Well, um... Hank wanted
to do something nice for you...

842
01:06:04.399 --> 01:06:06.526
...so he insisted that we...

843
01:06:06.610 --> 01:06:08.987
...go to a plastic surgeon.

844
01:06:09.070 --> 01:06:13.158
- Wha-what? Did you say plastic surgeon?
- Mm-hm.

845
01:06:13.241 --> 01:06:16.369
Oh, my God. Wha-wha... Ow! What is this?

846
01:06:16.453 --> 01:06:19.456
What is this? What d'you... Uh, what is this?

847
01:06:20.123 --> 01:06:24.461
Hank thought that you kinda...
had a weak chin, so...

848
01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:27.506
What?!

849
01:06:28.090 --> 01:06:31.051
I like my chin. I mean, I-I-I...

850
01:06:31.551 --> 01:06:33.386
I like my chin.

851
01:06:33.470 --> 01:06:36.056
It's my chin! It's my chin! Mine!

852
01:06:36.139 --> 01:06:37.641
How'd you pay for it?

853
01:06:37.724 --> 01:06:39.726
- I loaned him the money.
- Agh!

854
01:06:40.393 --> 01:06:43.146
Who the hell are you?

855
01:06:43.230 --> 01:06:44.689
It's me.

856
01:06:44.773 --> 01:06:46.775
Uh, Milky.

857
01:06:51.613 --> 01:06:54.282
Who the hell is Milky
and what is he doing here?

858
01:06:54.574 --> 01:06:56.243
Uh...

859
01:06:56.868 --> 01:07:00.705
Irene has a lot of people who would like
to see her in an unmarked grave.

860
01:07:00.789 --> 01:07:03.583
I don't think it's safe
for you to hang around with us.

861
01:07:03.667 --> 01:07:07.712
Why not?
You, Irene and Hank are my only friends.

862
01:07:08.588 --> 01:07:11.466
What about your family?
Won't they miss you?

863
01:07:11.550 --> 01:07:13.552
My family's all...

864
01:07:14.636 --> 01:07:16.471
They're gone.

865
01:07:17.389 --> 01:07:19.391
Oh, jeez.

866
01:07:27.149 --> 01:07:30.861
Well, we can't call you Milky any more.
What's your real name?

867
01:07:30.944 --> 01:07:34.114
Casper. But my friends call me Whitey.

868
01:07:35.657 --> 01:07:37.659
Uh, OK.

869
01:08:16.364 --> 01:08:20.160
- Here you go. I got your car all filled up.
- Thank you, Joseph.

870
01:08:22.871 --> 01:08:24.998
Oh, yeah.

871
01:08:27.751 --> 01:08:30.670
Get your cock out of my Chrysler,
you son of a bitch!

872
01:08:33.548 --> 01:08:37.886
You son of a...!
I'm gonna kill you! I'm gonna get you!

873
01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:22.472
What's that on your shirt? Whoa!

874
01:09:23.306 --> 01:09:25.308
I'm sorry.

875
01:09:26.476 --> 01:09:28.478
Oh, that was good.

876
01:09:29.438 --> 01:09:32.315
Charlie, what the hell is that?

877
01:09:32.399 --> 01:09:36.069
- Oh, yeah, I'm gonna fall for that.
- No, Ch-Charlie.

878
01:09:36.153 --> 01:09:38.780
Mm-mm, not me. Mm-mm.

879
01:09:38.864 --> 01:09:40.866
Nice try though.

880
01:09:40.949 --> 01:09:43.243
How dumb do I look?

881
01:10:03.305 --> 01:10:06.183
Hey, they only had two rooms: 19 and 20.

882
01:10:06.266 --> 01:10:08.477
So you guys will have to bunk up.

883
01:10:21.281 --> 01:10:23.658
So, Whitey, um...

884
01:10:24.701 --> 01:10:26.828
...what happened to your family?

885
01:10:26.912 --> 01:10:28.830
I killed them.

886
01:10:28.914 --> 01:10:31.041
Uh, uh, uh... come again?

887
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.671
When I was 15, I hacked them up
with a hammer while they were sleeping.

888
01:10:36.755 --> 01:10:40.300
Ma, Dad, my bro and my sis.

889
01:10:42.928 --> 01:10:44.930
She was awake, my sis.

890
01:10:47.015 --> 01:10:49.017
Which I regret.

891
01:10:50.769 --> 01:10:52.771
Yeah, well...

892
01:10:53.980 --> 01:10:57.317
We all, uh... have family stuff.

893
01:10:58.944 --> 01:11:02.823
That's what makes the holidays so hard.

894
01:11:02.906 --> 01:11:05.992
I just got released last month
on my 21st birthday.

895
01:11:07.327 --> 01:11:12.499
To tell you the truth, I really wasn't ready
to leave, but they said I had to.

896
01:11:15.001 --> 01:11:17.003
That's a fucked-up law, huh?

897
01:11:19.256 --> 01:11:23.427
Well, I guess they...
need the extra room for the real...

898
01:11:23.510 --> 01:11:24.845
...psychos.

899
01:11:24.928 --> 01:11:27.806
I'm gonna go and try
to make out with whatsherface.

900
01:11:27.889 --> 01:11:29.558
- Go for it.
- All right!

901
01:11:30.016 --> 01:11:31.977
- What?
- Yeah.

902
01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:37.357
He just told me that he brutally murdered
his entire family in their sleep!

903
01:11:37.732 --> 01:11:40.944
- Oh, my God!
- He was ajuvenile. They just let him out.

904
01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:48.285
So I was, um... gonna ask if I could...

905
01:11:48.368 --> 01:11:50.370
...stay here.

906
01:11:50.996 --> 01:11:52.998
But I can sleep in the car.

907
01:11:58.545 --> 01:12:01.506
That's me and my whippersnappers.
I'm Dorothy.

908
01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:04.593
Look at you!

909
01:12:06.595 --> 01:12:09.890
When did you take this?
At, uh, at Halloween?

910
01:12:09.973 --> 01:12:12.392
No. Just messing around the house.

911
01:12:17.022 --> 01:12:19.608
You seem like a really good dad, Charlie.

912
01:12:23.403 --> 01:12:25.405
I try to be.

913
01:12:26.531 --> 01:12:29.743
They're incredible kids. Oh, God.

914
01:12:29.993 --> 01:12:34.581
So happy and funny.
They never give me any grief.

915
01:12:35.582 --> 01:12:39.377
- They're the top three students out of 211.
- Golly!

916
01:12:39.461 --> 01:12:42.964
- I don't know where they get it from.
- That's just good genes.

917
01:12:47.052 --> 01:12:52.182
You know, I don't think I... No, I don't think
I carry even one picture any more.

918
01:12:52.766 --> 01:12:55.519
- Why not?
- I don't know. I don't know.

919
01:12:55.602 --> 01:13:00.732
I used to when I was younger.
Pictures of friends and stuff like that.

920
01:13:00.816 --> 01:13:03.819
I guess they just got old and fell apart.

921
01:13:06.029 --> 01:13:08.865
Kind of like the friendships.

922
01:13:10.659 --> 01:13:12.661
That's too bad.

923
01:13:18.041 --> 01:13:22.087
- Tell you what. Why not keep that one?
- No, Charlie. That's yours.

924
01:13:22.170 --> 01:13:26.133
Are you kidding? I have tons of them
at home. No, I got a bunch. Come on.

925
01:13:26.216 --> 01:13:28.218
- You do?
- Yeah.

926
01:13:29.094 --> 01:13:30.720
OK.

927
01:13:31.179 --> 01:13:33.181
Thanks.

928
01:13:35.058 --> 01:13:37.060
Thanks.

929
01:13:50.949 --> 01:13:52.951
I'm dry.

930
01:13:55.829 --> 01:13:58.999
You know, I'm gonna, uh... go get a soda.

931
01:13:59.082 --> 01:14:02.711
- Y-you want a soda?
- Sure. OK. OK.

932
01:14:23.064 --> 01:14:27.402
I caught that, bozo.
Not once but twice it burned ya.

933
01:14:31.948 --> 01:14:34.159
Give it another kick.

934
01:14:41.958 --> 01:14:44.711
- I think I just had an epiphany!
- What?

935
01:14:44.795 --> 01:14:48.173
That I might be able to control
this problem of mine.

936
01:14:48.256 --> 01:14:49.966
Oh, how'd you learn that?

937
01:14:50.050 --> 01:14:54.387
Well, first the Coke machine robbed me.
And I'm fine with that.

938
01:14:54.471 --> 01:14:57.557
But then some guy came up
and laughed in my face.

939
01:14:57.641 --> 01:15:00.602
- Oh, no.
- No, no, but that's just it!

940
01:15:00.685 --> 01:15:04.481
See? Just when I was starting to feel
those old familiar feelings...

941
01:15:04.564 --> 01:15:09.194
...I just took a deep breath, counted
backwards from ten and I said to the guy...

942
01:15:09.277 --> 01:15:12.989
..."Excuse me, sir, but your laughter
is not helping me right now."

943
01:15:13.073 --> 01:15:18.995
And he said "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make
fun." That was it! I helped him with his bags.

944
01:15:19.079 --> 01:15:21.081
- Really?
- Yes.

945
01:15:21.164 --> 01:15:23.208
Well, that's great!

946
01:15:23.291 --> 01:15:25.419
- And you got the Cokes.
- Hey!

947
01:15:25.502 --> 01:15:29.089
Just a little rap on the side
of the machine and presto!

948
01:15:29.172 --> 01:15:31.383
Maybe that's it though, you know?

949
01:15:33.927 --> 01:15:38.682
- Look what I found in my bag.
- Oh, no! Oh, boy.

950
01:15:39.015 --> 01:15:41.017
What do you think? Do you?

951
01:15:41.685 --> 01:15:46.022
Under the right circumstances,
sure, I could tip a few. OK.

952
01:15:46.815 --> 01:15:49.609
- And these <i>are</i> the right circumstances.
- OK!

953
01:15:50.736 --> 01:15:52.070
There you go.

954
01:15:52.154 --> 01:15:55.198
Oh! Oh, well.

955
01:15:55.282 --> 01:15:57.117
Whoa, that must be mine!

956
01:16:13.884 --> 01:16:15.886
Oh!

957
01:16:21.308 --> 01:16:23.310
Ooh!

958
01:16:28.023 --> 01:16:30.025
Ow.

959
01:16:49.628 --> 01:16:51.630
Whoa, Jesus! Oh, God.

960
01:16:52.714 --> 01:16:54.716
Oh... my... God!

961
01:17:02.224 --> 01:17:04.226
Agh!

962
01:17:11.191 --> 01:17:13.193
Irene?

963
01:17:13.860 --> 01:17:15.195
Hm?

964
01:17:15.278 --> 01:17:18.115
Why am I peeing
like I was up all night having sex?

965
01:17:19.282 --> 01:17:22.244
<i>Well, seems old Hank had pulled a fast one.</i>

966
01:17:22.411 --> 01:17:27.958
<i>And if that wasn't bad enough, there was</i>
<i>more trouble right around the corner.</i>

967
01:17:31.253 --> 01:17:33.922
I want everybody to stay put
and wait for my order.

968
01:17:34.131 --> 01:17:38.343
- You mean you couldn't tell the difference?
- Are you serious?

969
01:17:39.678 --> 01:17:43.432
- Who the hell could?
- A sober person... for one.

970
01:17:43.890 --> 01:17:46.393
So we had some drinks.

971
01:17:53.733 --> 01:17:56.278
Well, look who joined the party.

972
01:17:58.447 --> 01:18:02.284
Did you have fun?
"Ooh, yes, I did! Ooh, yes I did!"

973
01:18:03.118 --> 01:18:05.912
So old Hanky-Panky
wasn't enough for you, huh?

974
01:18:07.372 --> 01:18:09.374
It wasn't for me.

975
01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:16.298
- Are you sure this is the woman?
- Absolutely.

976
01:18:16.381 --> 01:18:20.594
When my boyfriend Scooter brought in
the paper, I recognised her right away.

977
01:18:22.971 --> 01:18:25.348
Thanks a lot. Scooter.

978
01:18:32.063 --> 01:18:35.609
- Here they come.
- Look, Starsky and Hutch, this is the plan.

979
01:18:35.692 --> 01:18:38.862
Let us talk to our dad
so this ain't gotta be no big thing.

980
01:18:38.945 --> 01:18:43.658
Thanks, but this is the end of the line for you.
Officer Stubie'll drive you to the chopper.

981
01:18:43.742 --> 01:18:47.329
Oh, what?! You brung us all the way down
for us to leave now?

982
01:18:47.412 --> 01:18:51.500
- That don't make no motherfuckin' sense!
- You've done all you can do.

983
01:18:51.583 --> 01:18:53.877
This is a police matter from now on.

984
01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:59.508
Wait. It may be a police matter, but the police
don't matter shit when it's my daddy in there!

985
01:18:59.841 --> 01:19:03.762
I said you're gettin' the hell outta here.
That's the end of it.

986
01:19:05.806 --> 01:19:09.726
Guys, look, I'm sorry.
I hate to admit it, but this time he's right.

987
01:19:09.810 --> 01:19:13.313
- You can't be here. It's a liability.
<i>- He's</i> the fuckin' liability!

988
01:19:13.396 --> 01:19:17.359
Don't worry. This is my investigation.
I promise there will be no bloodshed.

989
01:19:17.442 --> 01:19:19.277
I promise!

990
01:19:20.362 --> 01:19:22.447
Come on, guys. Let's go.

991
01:19:22.531 --> 01:19:23.990
I told y'all.

992
01:19:26.993 --> 01:19:28.954
You OK, Charlie?

993
01:19:29.037 --> 01:19:31.706
Uh... yeah. I'm just, uh...

994
01:19:32.666 --> 01:19:34.209
...freshening up!

995
01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:41.258
How do you wanna handle it?

996
01:19:43.385 --> 01:19:46.388
I say we storm the place and start shooting.

997
01:19:46.471 --> 01:19:49.933
- What if he's unarmed?
- Plant a gun on him afterwards.

998
01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:57.774
Well, don't fuck it up this time.

999
01:20:19.796 --> 01:20:21.798
Agent Boshane!

1000
01:20:22.966 --> 01:20:25.886
It's Stubie. He's got Baileygates and the girl.

1001
01:20:26.511 --> 01:20:28.513
What?

1002
01:20:32.517 --> 01:20:34.478
This is Boshane. What's going on?

1003
01:20:34.561 --> 01:20:38.231
<i>I caught 'em out on 134 in a stolen vehicle.</i>
<i>Baileygates and the girl.</i>

1004
01:20:38.315 --> 01:20:41.485
Officer Stubie,
I don't want you to attempt to move them.

1005
01:20:41.568 --> 01:20:45.530
<i>- Don't</i> move them! We'll be right there.
- Get in your cars. Come on!

1006
01:20:47.491 --> 01:20:51.578
We sure is sorry, Officer,
but our daddy told us to trust our instinct...

1007
01:20:51.661 --> 01:20:55.248
...and our instinct says
somethin' don't smell right. Let's roll.

1008
01:20:55.332 --> 01:20:57.876
You guys are making a big mistake!

1009
01:20:57.959 --> 01:21:02.422
Cos I promise you, when I find your old man,
I'm personally gonna fuck him up!

1010
01:21:06.218 --> 01:21:09.262
Why'd you go an' say
somethin' like that for, huh?

1011
01:21:09.346 --> 01:21:10.847
Lee Harvey.

1012
01:21:10.931 --> 01:21:13.433
- What's the diameter of a chicken egg?
- 4.08cm.

1013
01:21:13.517 --> 01:21:17.020
- No, what's that in inches?
- 1.61. What the fuck you gettin' at?

1014
01:21:17.104 --> 01:21:20.565
I got ten bucks say
I can squeeze a chicken egg up his ass.

1015
01:21:20.649 --> 01:21:23.610
You can't put no chicken egg up his ass.
He's a tightass!

1016
01:21:23.693 --> 01:21:26.071
- No, it can be done.
- Yo, I'll take that bet.

1017
01:21:26.154 --> 01:21:28.156
- Right on.
- Pull yo' ass out!

1018
01:21:36.957 --> 01:21:40.877
I'll tell you one thing. If I didn't have bad luck,
I'd have no luck at all.

1019
01:21:40.961 --> 01:21:45.424
- What are we gonna do about Whitey?
- Take a guess. We're going on without him.

1020
01:21:45.507 --> 01:21:47.384
Moody.

1021
01:21:47.467 --> 01:21:52.681
Well, I didn't have the fun you had last night.
Just the hangover and the swollen prostate.

1022
01:21:52.764 --> 01:21:57.310
- D'you have any cash left?
- Yes. $60, but it's Whitey's.

1023
01:21:57.394 --> 01:22:02.107
Yeah, well, bad things happen to people
who kill their family with a hammer.

1024
01:22:07.446 --> 01:22:10.115
- I'm payin' under protest.
- It was close enough.

1025
01:22:10.198 --> 01:22:12.200
Yeah, whatever.

1026
01:22:14.119 --> 01:22:15.454
Shit.

1027
01:22:15.537 --> 01:22:18.915
Give me the scanner,
so we can find out what the fuck's goin' on!

1028
01:22:18.999 --> 01:22:21.042
Anybody know how to fly this thing?

1029
01:22:21.126 --> 01:22:24.296
Motherfucker,
it's just lift versus drag and rotation!

1030
01:22:24.379 --> 01:22:28.550
- Yeah, get your head out your ass!
- It ain't that. This manual's in German.

1031
01:22:28.633 --> 01:22:33.305
- Motherfucker, you speak German!
- I can speak it. I didn't say I could read it!

1032
01:22:33.388 --> 01:22:35.557
You's a motherfuckin' disgrace!

1033
01:22:45.025 --> 01:22:49.654
- Then get this motherfucker off the ground!
- All right, all right, all right! Oh, shit!

1034
01:23:02.667 --> 01:23:04.669
Oh!

1035
01:23:05.253 --> 01:23:08.840
Ohhhh, Jesus!

1036
01:23:12.302 --> 01:23:16.431
Would somebody get this goddamn chicken
out of my ass, please? Oh!

1037
01:23:29.611 --> 01:23:34.616
Everybody, stay back. We'll do this
alone. I'll take 19, you take 20. Stay back!

1038
01:23:42.707 --> 01:23:44.709
Goddamn it!

1039
01:23:47.712 --> 01:23:51.341
Sons of bitches, I'll show 'em.
Sons of bitches.

1040
01:23:52.300 --> 01:23:55.637
- I need a gun and lots of ammo.
- Whoa. Sorry.

1041
01:23:55.720 --> 01:23:58.265
72-hour wait. Federal law.

1042
01:23:58.348 --> 01:24:02.352
- How far am I from Rhode Island?
- Uh, four or five hours.

1043
01:24:02.436 --> 01:24:06.022
Got a map of New England,
if you want. $1.95.

1044
01:24:07.524 --> 01:24:10.485
- Here's a five. Keep the change.
- Thanks.

1045
01:24:21.663 --> 01:24:24.291
- Hello.
<i>- Finneran, it's Charlie.</i>

1046
01:24:24.374 --> 01:24:27.294
Charlie, you are in deep shit.
Where the hell are you?

1047
01:24:27.544 --> 01:24:30.088
Listen, you gotta get a message
to the colonel.

1048
01:24:30.172 --> 01:24:34.676
But no one outside the department
can know about this, OK? Cos this is deep.

1049
01:24:35.552 --> 01:24:39.556
4.30, South County train station.
Bring plenty of backup. You got it.

1050
01:24:39.639 --> 01:24:44.811
Don't worry. Nobody outside the department
will hear about this. Watch yourself, buddy.

1051
01:24:47.355 --> 01:24:49.316
4.30, huh?

1052
01:24:49.399 --> 01:24:53.487
Thanks for notifying us, Officer.
No, you've been a really big help.

1053
01:24:53.570 --> 01:24:55.572
- You stay close.
- Yes, sir.

1054
01:24:56.823 --> 01:24:58.825
- Excuse me.
- Huh?

1055
01:24:59.743 --> 01:25:03.371
- Where's Dickie?
- He's waiting for us in Boston.

1056
01:25:03.455 --> 01:25:06.917
Well, I think it's time
our rich boy got his hands dirty.

1057
01:25:08.794 --> 01:25:10.504
Tell me.

1058
01:25:10.587 --> 01:25:12.380
How was, uh...

1059
01:25:12.464 --> 01:25:14.508
...Mr Wonderful?

1060
01:25:14.591 --> 01:25:18.720
This is getting <i>really</i> ridiculous, Charlie,
so just let it go.

1061
01:25:18.804 --> 01:25:23.475
I just... I turn my back for one minute
and you stick it up my ass! Literally!

1062
01:25:23.558 --> 01:25:26.728
For your information,
you stuck it in your own ass!

1063
01:25:27.854 --> 01:25:33.193
Oh, don't turn this around on me, OK? You're
the one who can't keep your legs closed.

1064
01:25:42.577 --> 01:25:45.997
- Why are you doing this?
- Because I I... ike you.

1065
01:25:51.711 --> 01:25:53.713
What?

1066
01:25:56.299 --> 01:25:58.301
I like you.

1067
01:26:08.854 --> 01:26:10.856
I like you.

1068
01:26:11.898 --> 01:26:13.900
Well, you shouldn't, Charlie.

1069
01:26:15.277 --> 01:26:17.279
I'm just a ditz.

1070
01:26:18.864 --> 01:26:21.825
A ditz? What are you talking about?
You're 27 years old.

1071
01:26:21.908 --> 01:26:25.328
You're the superintendent
of a major golf resort.

1072
01:26:25.412 --> 01:26:30.584
Um, yeah, well, I kind of fudged my résumé
a little bit to get thatjob.

1073
01:26:31.251 --> 01:26:32.627
Oh?

1074
01:26:32.836 --> 01:26:38.258
Look, I don't know the first thing about
running a golf course, Charlie. I'm a model.

1075
01:26:39.885 --> 01:26:42.220
- Huh?
- I moved to New York...

1076
01:26:42.304 --> 01:26:46.308
...but none of it worked out,
so then I tried to be an actress and...

1077
01:26:46.391 --> 01:26:50.020
...I got this eating disorder
where I gained, like, 20lb.

1078
01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:52.814
- That's not that bad.
- In a week.

1079
01:26:52.898 --> 01:26:54.191
Oh.

1080
01:26:54.274 --> 01:26:56.985
So I kind of lost my self-respect.

1081
01:26:57.819 --> 01:27:01.281
Before you know it,
I had 70-year-old guys trying to support me...

1082
01:27:01.364 --> 01:27:04.201
...and I really didn't like who I was becoming.

1083
01:27:07.788 --> 01:27:11.708
God, I have made so many mistakes.

1084
01:27:13.543 --> 01:27:15.545
Irene...

1085
01:27:17.380 --> 01:27:21.093
...you didn't know
what Dickie was up to. Did you?

1086
01:27:22.427 --> 01:27:25.388
I may be a ditz, but I'm not a crook.

1087
01:27:55.961 --> 01:27:57.921
My ass is really sore.

1088
01:28:10.767 --> 01:28:12.769
Wow!

1089
01:28:14.563 --> 01:28:16.648
I never get tired of hearing that.

1090
01:28:33.582 --> 01:28:34.916
Hey.

1091
01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:38.920
Oh, I'm lookin' for my friends.
A pretty blonde and a guy with a buzz cut.

1092
01:28:39.004 --> 01:28:41.006
- Cabin E.
- Thanks a lot.

1093
01:28:51.975 --> 01:28:54.936
Sh! Don't make a sound.

1094
01:28:55.020 --> 01:28:57.939
I don't know anything,
and that's what I told the police.

1095
01:28:58.023 --> 01:29:02.235
Shut up, Irene! You just listen to me.
Maybe we can work something out.

1096
01:29:05.947 --> 01:29:09.451
Time to face the music, Mozart.
And one, and two, and...

1097
01:29:13.288 --> 01:29:14.998
Agh!

1098
01:29:18.085 --> 01:29:19.461
Ooh!

1099
01:29:19.544 --> 01:29:21.046
Whaaaa!

1100
01:29:30.597 --> 01:29:33.391
Warden, I want my own cell.

1101
01:29:34.267 --> 01:29:36.436
Oh, great. You again.

1102
01:29:38.730 --> 01:29:43.610
- What tree did this sap ooze out of?
- It's Dickie! He got me into all this crap!

1103
01:29:43.693 --> 01:29:45.737
- Oh, your golf buddy.
- Yeah.

1104
01:29:45.821 --> 01:29:48.073
- I hope it's OK if I play through.
- Hank!

1105
01:29:48.156 --> 01:29:50.867
- OK, turn around. I'll play the back nine.
- Stop it!

1106
01:29:50.951 --> 01:29:53.870
Come on. He couldn't have
chewed up the greens that badly.

1107
01:29:53.954 --> 01:29:56.206
- Get away from me!
- Whoa!

1108
01:29:56.456 --> 01:30:00.335
He hasn't played the course in a long time.
It was Charlie who was putting.

1109
01:30:00.836 --> 01:30:02.462
- Charlie?
- Yeah.

1110
01:30:02.546 --> 01:30:06.049
He might not be long on the tee,
but he's got a good up-and-down game.

1111
01:30:06.133 --> 01:30:08.677
What's that suppo... Can we speak English?

1112
01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:12.556
I never wanted to sleep with you, Hank!
OK? You tricked me!

1113
01:30:13.098 --> 01:30:17.310
That's right, I did trick you.
It was deceitful, disgusting and despicable.

1114
01:30:17.394 --> 01:30:20.147
But just this once,
try to look at it from my side.

1115
01:30:20.522 --> 01:30:22.190
I was horny.

1116
01:30:22.274 --> 01:30:23.984
Oh, God!

1117
01:30:24.067 --> 01:30:25.902
You are such an asshole!

1118
01:30:25.986 --> 01:30:28.572
Come on. Don't be mad, my little pussyfart.

1119
01:30:29.448 --> 01:30:31.116
Argh!

1120
01:30:32.659 --> 01:30:34.911
I warned you about that, buddy!

1121
01:30:35.203 --> 01:30:37.205
Warned me about what?

1122
01:30:39.082 --> 01:30:41.376
- Charlie?
- Uh-huh.

1123
01:30:42.294 --> 01:30:45.046
Providence, Rhode Island. Ten-minute stop.

1124
01:30:45.130 --> 01:30:47.382
Huh? Did you...

1125
01:30:47.466 --> 01:30:48.967
- What?
- What's going on?

1126
01:30:49.050 --> 01:30:51.511
- Hank was coming on to me again.
- Hank!

1127
01:30:52.763 --> 01:30:55.599
Damn it. I am so sick of that guy!

1128
01:30:56.099 --> 01:31:00.395
OK, Hank, come out here. Let's settle this
the old-fashioned way. Come on!

1129
01:31:00.479 --> 01:31:03.315
I may not be tough,
but damn it, I can get good and mad!

1130
01:31:03.899 --> 01:31:05.901
Stop it, man. You're scaring me.

1131
01:31:07.027 --> 01:31:09.863
- What's the matter?
- Let's go before he wakes up.

1132
01:31:09.946 --> 01:31:13.200
I'm not through with you, buster.
I'm not through with you!

1133
01:31:19.915 --> 01:31:23.210
What's up, Hank? Afraid to pick on
someone your own size?

1134
01:31:25.462 --> 01:31:28.173
Are you OK? What happened?

1135
01:31:28.965 --> 01:31:30.634
That was dirty.

1136
01:31:30.717 --> 01:31:32.969
All right. Come on.

1137
01:31:33.053 --> 01:31:35.097
Where are you? Where are you?!

1138
01:31:35.180 --> 01:31:38.725
- Here I am.
- Huh? Ooh, you bastard.

1139
01:31:41.978 --> 01:31:44.272
Stop it, you're gonna kill him!

1140
01:31:45.065 --> 01:31:50.112
You're choking me!
You're choking me! Argh!

1141
01:31:50.195 --> 01:31:52.489
Ow, ow, ow, Charlie, don't break it.

1142
01:31:52.572 --> 01:31:56.660
- Get on your knees and beg me.
- Up yours. Aieee! You!

1143
01:32:02.082 --> 01:32:04.584
On your feet. We're gonna have fun.

1144
01:32:05.085 --> 01:32:06.711
Irene!

1145
01:32:06.795 --> 01:32:09.381
Irene!

1146
01:32:11.049 --> 01:32:15.220
Hi, ladies. My name is
Charlie Baileygates. Wanna see my weasel?

1147
01:32:19.850 --> 01:32:23.687
Free hot dogs here. All you can eat.
Get your foot-long and a bag of nuts.

1148
01:32:23.770 --> 01:32:27.733
No! Don't listen to him!
It's not me! It's Hank!

1149
01:32:27.816 --> 01:32:29.234
It's Hank!

1150
01:32:29.317 --> 01:32:31.194
Argh!

1151
01:32:32.195 --> 01:32:35.949
Come back here, Hank!
I'm not through with you!

1152
01:32:36.283 --> 01:32:37.784
Aaaagh!

1153
01:32:43.540 --> 01:32:45.876
- Had enough?
- Up yours.

1154
01:32:48.170 --> 01:32:50.005
Eugh!

1155
01:32:50.630 --> 01:32:52.299
Stop it, you two! Stop it!

1156
01:32:56.845 --> 01:32:58.430
It's Gerke! Come on!

1157
01:32:58.847 --> 01:33:01.767
- Hank, truce?
- For now, fucker.

1158
01:33:07.689 --> 01:33:10.150
Watch out! He's got a gun!

1159
01:33:10.776 --> 01:33:13.487
I'll follow the girl. You get Baileygates!

1160
01:33:19.659 --> 01:33:22.996
Police officer! Everybody down! Get down!

1161
01:33:25.749 --> 01:33:27.584
Ow!

1162
01:33:30.212 --> 01:33:31.671
Get outta the way!

1163
01:33:35.342 --> 01:33:39.137
Hank, we're shot!
You pussy, it's just a flesh wound.

1164
01:33:50.107 --> 01:33:54.986
- Look, there's keys in that car.
- No, I can't go on.

1165
01:33:56.321 --> 01:33:58.657
I think... Oh!

1166
01:33:59.282 --> 01:34:01.993
I think I'm gonna... faint.

1167
01:34:09.292 --> 01:34:13.296
Do you mean to say
I've gotta carry your sorry ass?

1168
01:34:14.172 --> 01:34:16.216
All right.

1169
01:34:16.299 --> 01:34:18.927
Come on, Rip Van Wussy.

1170
01:34:22.347 --> 01:34:24.349
Jesus, you're heavy.

1171
01:34:29.354 --> 01:34:31.356
Now get in there!

1172
01:34:39.948 --> 01:34:41.783
And we're gone.

1173
01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:47.289
- Shit!
- Don't worry.

1174
01:34:49.291 --> 01:34:51.293
Oh!

1175
01:34:51.376 --> 01:34:56.506
- Hank, what have you done?! Oh, my God!
- Don't you just love it?

1176
01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:17.903
You are a sick pup.

1177
01:35:17.986 --> 01:35:20.322
Yeah, well, takes one to know one.

1178
01:35:20.405 --> 01:35:23.658
What are you doing? Hank? Hank! Oh!

1179
01:35:23.909 --> 01:35:26.328
Ever been bitch-slapped?

1180
01:35:26.411 --> 01:35:29.081
I'm gonna kill you, Hank! I swear to God!

1181
01:35:30.957 --> 01:35:35.462
Arrivederci, deadwood.
No!

1182
01:36:21.258 --> 01:36:25.846
- What are you still doin' here?
- Hank, we're in this together.

1183
01:36:32.769 --> 01:36:34.354
Pritchard.

1184
01:36:34.438 --> 01:36:37.858
Cover the other end.
I want Charlie arrested on sight.

1185
01:36:53.457 --> 01:36:55.459
Argh!

1186
01:37:12.476 --> 01:37:15.103
Hey, Irene. You just keep walking, now.

1187
01:37:26.531 --> 01:37:28.200
Irene!

1188
01:37:28.992 --> 01:37:30.994
Irene!

1189
01:37:34.289 --> 01:37:36.458
Baileygates, you're coming with me.

1190
01:37:36.541 --> 01:37:38.168
- Not now, Finneran.
- Yes, now!

1191
01:37:41.546 --> 01:37:44.382
- That was me.
- Yeah, big deal.

1192
01:37:44.466 --> 01:37:47.177
- Shut up, Hank! You're so...
- Hank!

1193
01:37:48.011 --> 01:37:51.348
- Hank!
- Hey! Let her go!

1194
01:37:51.431 --> 01:37:54.559
- She asked for me, asshole.
- Big deal!

1195
01:37:58.522 --> 01:38:01.274
Dickie, you know I don't know anything!

1196
01:38:01.358 --> 01:38:03.360
Shut up, Irene. It's too late.

1197
01:38:09.491 --> 01:38:12.160
Oh! Oh! Hank!

1198
01:38:14.538 --> 01:38:16.289
Hank!

1199
01:38:16.373 --> 01:38:18.375
- No way.
- Come on.

1200
01:38:25.507 --> 01:38:27.175
Ooh!

1201
01:38:28.635 --> 01:38:30.095
Oh, no. Water.

1202
01:38:30.178 --> 01:38:33.056
Yeah. She's screwed.
I'll buy you a beer.

1203
01:38:33.390 --> 01:38:35.517
No! We're doin' it!

1204
01:38:38.145 --> 01:38:40.105
Hank!

1205
01:38:40.188 --> 01:38:43.525
Hank! What are you doing? Give me the leg!

1206
01:38:43.608 --> 01:38:45.861
Agh! Hank, hurry!

1207
01:38:45.944 --> 01:38:47.237
Oh!

1208
01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:49.489
This is my body!

1209
01:38:49.573 --> 01:38:51.825
Do you understand that?

1210
01:38:52.159 --> 01:38:56.121
I call the shots from now on, Hank!
I don't need you to fight my battles for me!

1211
01:38:56.204 --> 01:39:00.375
If you can back down from something
this important, you're nothing at all!

1212
01:39:00.459 --> 01:39:03.003
You're nothing at all!

1213
01:39:07.549 --> 01:39:09.342
I got my leg back.

1214
01:39:09.426 --> 01:39:11.887
Oh, no. Hank!

1215
01:39:12.304 --> 01:39:13.972
I'm coming, Irene!

1216
01:39:14.055 --> 01:39:15.724
Agh!

1217
01:39:18.351 --> 01:39:21.480
- Hank! Oh!
- It's OK, Irene.

1218
01:39:23.315 --> 01:39:25.317
Hank's gone.

1219
01:39:25.609 --> 01:39:27.986
- It's me, Charlie.
- Charlie?

1220
01:39:28.070 --> 01:39:30.906
Uh, maybe you should go back and get help.

1221
01:39:30.989 --> 01:39:32.991
No, I can handle it.

1222
01:39:35.327 --> 01:39:38.121
I'm warning you, pal. You're gonna get hurt.

1223
01:39:39.456 --> 01:39:41.708
Be careful, Charlie!

1224
01:39:41.875 --> 01:39:45.670
- Just do what he says, Charlie!
- Back off! Just turn around! Now!

1225
01:39:45.754 --> 01:39:48.090
Take it easy, Dickie. Take it easy.

1226
01:39:49.966 --> 01:39:51.885
There's nowhere to go.

1227
01:39:52.469 --> 01:39:54.513
Come on, Dickie.

1228
01:39:54.596 --> 01:39:56.890
Give me the gun. Come on.

1229
01:39:59.267 --> 01:40:01.603
Come on. That's it.

1230
01:40:02.646 --> 01:40:04.272
Nice and easy.

1231
01:40:04.940 --> 01:40:06.775
Argh!

1232
01:40:10.028 --> 01:40:11.863
Argh!

1233
01:40:15.242 --> 01:40:16.952
Where's my thumb?

1234
01:40:17.035 --> 01:40:19.371
That's kidnapping <i>and</i> assault!

1235
01:40:19.454 --> 01:40:21.456
- Why stop there?
- No!

1236
01:40:21.540 --> 01:40:22.666
Ooh!

1237
01:40:22.749 --> 01:40:24.751
Oh, God! Oh!

1238
01:40:25.919 --> 01:40:27.629
Whitey!

1239
01:40:27.712 --> 01:40:29.840
Rock 'n' roll!

1240
01:40:36.638 --> 01:40:38.098
Irene!

1241
01:40:39.307 --> 01:40:41.309
Irene!

1242
01:40:53.697 --> 01:40:55.699
Irene!

1243
01:41:06.334 --> 01:41:08.044
Irene!

1244
01:41:13.759 --> 01:41:16.720
- Irene!
- What? What?

1245
01:41:16.803 --> 01:41:18.805
Oh, my God! Ow.

1246
01:41:19.765 --> 01:41:21.767
Oh! Oh!

1247
01:41:28.356 --> 01:41:30.776
Keep goin'. Bring it down. Bring it down.

1248
01:41:31.485 --> 01:41:33.987
<i>We're comin', Daddy! We're comin', man!</i>

1249
01:41:34.071 --> 01:41:36.156
It's my kids!

1250
01:41:40.702 --> 01:41:44.164
<i>Hang on, Daddy!</i>
<i>Grab a hold of that motherfucker, man!</i>

1251
01:42:06.395 --> 01:42:09.773
So, how's my thumb lookin', Doc?

1252
01:42:09.856 --> 01:42:12.609
I'll let you know when I find it.

1253
01:42:12.692 --> 01:42:16.696
Irene, Charlie,
this is Agent Steve Parfitt, FBI.

1254
01:42:16.780 --> 01:42:20.992
- Nice to see ya.
- You must be real proud of these maniacs.

1255
01:42:21.785 --> 01:42:23.787
Oh, I am.

1256
01:42:25.372 --> 01:42:27.874
Yeah, we're proud of this motherfucker too.

1257
01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.753
It's good to see you're safe, Dad.

1258
01:42:31.837 --> 01:42:36.174
<i>The colonel informed them that</i>
<i>all the guilty parties had been apprehended.</i>

1259
01:42:36.258 --> 01:42:38.844
<i>Gerke was arraigned</i>
<i>at a Providence hospital...</i>

1260
01:42:38.927 --> 01:42:43.390
<i>... and Agent Boshane had been arrested</i>
<i>at the train station in New London.</i>

1261
01:42:43.557 --> 01:42:46.893
<i>But Charlie Baileygates</i>
<i>had other things on his mind.</i>

1262
01:42:47.436 --> 01:42:50.355
- Charlie, nicely done.
- Oh, thanks, Sea Bass.

1263
01:42:51.773 --> 01:42:56.695
Hey, Whitey. Listen, I wanted to tell you that
I really appreciate everything you did for me.

1264
01:42:56.778 --> 01:42:58.864
I owe you a huge one.

1265
01:42:59.197 --> 01:43:02.701
And... I'm truly sorry
that you had to kill again.

1266
01:43:03.452 --> 01:43:07.247
- Must be messing with your head.
- I never killed anyone before.

1267
01:43:07.873 --> 01:43:11.251
- What?
- You're a schizo who's wanted for murder...

1268
01:43:11.334 --> 01:43:15.589
...and you're laying in bed next to me
gabbing like a 16-year-old girl on the phone.

1269
01:43:15.672 --> 01:43:17.466
You freaked me out, man.

1270
01:43:17.883 --> 01:43:21.303
But what about your family?
How did they die?

1271
01:43:21.762 --> 01:43:24.181
I never said they were dead.

1272
01:43:24.264 --> 01:43:26.308
I said they were gone.

1273
01:43:26.391 --> 01:43:28.810
They moved to Phoenix, the bastards.

1274
01:43:28.894 --> 01:43:31.938
Look at me.
I wouldn't last two minutes in the desert.

1275
01:43:32.856 --> 01:43:35.525
Hey, your bandage is wet.

1276
01:43:35.609 --> 01:43:38.403
Oh, yeah? Well, maybe it's time to come off.

1277
01:43:39.279 --> 01:43:41.615
I'm surprised it's held on this long.

1278
01:43:42.449 --> 01:43:44.284
Hey, that's not so bad.

1279
01:43:45.410 --> 01:43:47.871
- Hey, Daddy, we just wanted to say that...
- Hm?

1280
01:43:47.954 --> 01:43:50.123
Holy shit!

1281
01:43:50.207 --> 01:43:52.375
Look, Daddy got a butthole on his face.

1282
01:43:52.459 --> 01:43:55.962
Oh, boy. Here we go.

1283
01:43:56.922 --> 01:43:59.466
He sure is a Spartacus-lookin' motherfucker.

1284
01:43:59.883 --> 01:44:04.638
Hey, Daddy, now you can blow your nose
and wipe your ass at the same damn time!

1285
01:44:11.311 --> 01:44:13.563
You know what I'm saying?

1286
01:44:21.863 --> 01:44:23.865
- So...
- So...

1287
01:44:24.741 --> 01:44:28.912
- How'd your meeting with the shrink go?
- Oh, wonderful.

1288
01:44:28.995 --> 01:44:31.998
Clean bill of health.
A well-rounded individual.

1289
01:44:32.541 --> 01:44:35.919
That's great, Charlie. I'm really happy for you.

1290
01:44:36.211 --> 01:44:37.921
Thank you.

1291
01:44:38.422 --> 01:44:40.090
Well, uh...

1292
01:44:40.715 --> 01:44:43.009
I hope if you're ever... you know...

1293
01:44:43.635 --> 01:44:45.637
...around here, you'll, uh...

1294
01:44:47.556 --> 01:44:49.349
...come and visit us.

1295
01:44:49.975 --> 01:44:51.601
Yeah.

1296
01:44:51.977 --> 01:44:55.439
- Little Rhodie.
- Biggest little state in the union.

1297
01:44:57.983 --> 01:44:59.985
Yeah.

1298
01:45:00.610 --> 01:45:02.112
Yeah.

1299
01:45:04.740 --> 01:45:07.826
- Oh, let me get that for you.
- Oh. Thanks.

1300
01:45:10.954 --> 01:45:12.748
Hey, Irene?

1301
01:45:12.831 --> 01:45:14.666
Yeah?

1302
01:45:15.375 --> 01:45:17.919
Maybe I could
come visit you sometime soon.

1303
01:45:19.796 --> 01:45:21.298
Promise?

1304
01:45:23.633 --> 01:45:25.802
You bet.

1305
01:45:27.929 --> 01:45:31.767
And that's the word of
a Rhode Island State Trooper, ma'am.

1306
01:46:37.374 --> 01:46:39.209
You gotta be kidding.

1307
01:46:42.712 --> 01:46:45.090
<i>Hold it right there.</i>

1308
01:46:50.303 --> 01:46:51.638
- Miss Waters.
- Yes?

1309
01:46:51.721 --> 01:46:55.100
- I'd like you to step out of the car.
- What did I <i>not</i> do now?

1310
01:46:55.183 --> 01:46:58.353
- We've reason to believe this is stolen.
- What?!

1311
01:46:58.437 --> 01:47:01.690
No. No, no, I re... I rented this car!

1312
01:47:02.065 --> 01:47:04.484
Would you step out of the car, please?

1313
01:47:06.570 --> 01:47:08.572
Great.

1314
01:47:10.490 --> 01:47:13.201
Front of the car, please. Hands on the hood.

1315
01:47:13.285 --> 01:47:14.995
Spread your legs.

1316
01:47:15.078 --> 01:47:18.540
- That's great. Uh-huh.
- Thank you. Following procedure, ma'am.

1317
01:47:18.623 --> 01:47:21.626
Oh! Oh, you guys!

1318
01:47:22.419 --> 01:47:26.840
You guys are beautiful! Look,
why don't we skip the trial, get right to it?

1319
01:47:26.923 --> 01:47:29.593
You can lock me up
and keep me here for ever!

1320
01:47:31.136 --> 01:47:33.138
That's what I had planned.

1321
01:47:34.973 --> 01:47:36.641
Look.

1322
01:47:37.434 --> 01:47:42.314
- I hope her little skinny ass is reading this.
- Man, I'm pretty sure she's lookin', man.

1323
01:47:47.778 --> 01:47:49.780
Oh, Charlie.

1324
01:48:11.009 --> 01:48:13.762
It's gonna be raining wine and roses tonight.

1325
01:48:13.845 --> 01:48:19.976
It'll be rainin' my motherfuckin' cookies if this
motherfucker don't stop this turbulence shit!

1326
01:48:20.060 --> 01:48:23.730
<i>Well, that's Charlie's story,</i>
<i>and I'm sticking to it.</i>

1327
01:48:23.814 --> 01:48:27.901
<i>They all moved in together</i>
<i>and lived as one big happy family.</i>

1328
01:48:28.110 --> 01:48:33.448
<i>Charlie and Irene, the guys,</i>
<i>even that nice albino fella, Whitey.</i>

1329
01:48:33.532 --> 01:48:37.119
<i>And I'm happy to report</i>
<i>Charlie got promoted to lieutenant...</i>

1330
01:48:37.202 --> 01:48:43.750
<i>... in the greatest law enforcement agency</i>
<i>in the land: the Rhode Island State Police.</i>

1331
01:48:43.834 --> 01:48:47.003
<i>Yeah, it was a regular slice of Americana.</i>

1332
01:48:47.295 --> 01:48:51.049
Y'all come back now! Thanks
for watching our motherfuckin' movie!

OK, everybody, the water temperature is 63°.

1335
01:55:56.975 --> 01:56:00.145
Pop's thumb should be OK
if we find it within the next six hours.

1336
01:56:00.228 --> 01:56:02.564
- Sure?
- Do the math, motherfucker.

1337
01:56:02.647 --> 01:56:05.025
- Damn!
- Jeez.

1338
01:56:13.575 --> 01:56:16.411
- Fellas, I think I found it!
- What?

1339
01:56:23.085 --> 01:56:25.754
- False alarm.
- Oh, damn, Whitey!
