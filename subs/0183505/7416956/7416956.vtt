17
00:02:00.662 --> 00:02:05.082
Meet Charlie.
Helpful dad, upstanding citizen,

18
00:02:05.167 --> 00:02:10.213
and an 1 8-year veteran of the greatest
law enforcement agency in the land:

19
00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:13.549
the Rhode Island State Police.

20
00:02:18.931 --> 00:02:22.475
That's Charlie's home.
Modest, like the man.

21
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.897
Even though he lived on the water,
Charlie wasn't much of a swimmer,

22
00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:31.108
which will come into play
a little later in our story.

23
00:02:31.693 --> 00:02:34.237
But I'm getting way ahead of myself.

24
00:02:34.696 --> 00:02:39.200
You know, maybe it's best if we just
go back and begin at the beginning.

25
00:02:40.577 --> 00:02:44.080
As a young man,
Charlie had the world by its bootstraps.

26
00:02:44.373 --> 00:02:46.833
He was the best young trooper
on the force,

27
00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.253
and was dating
the prettiest and smartest gal in town.

28
00:02:50.587 --> 00:02:53.589
Her name was Layla...
Just like the melody.

29
00:02:54.758 --> 00:02:56.092
Charlie,

30
00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:58.636
you've no idea how much I love you.

31
00:03:02.558 --> 00:03:04.392
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

32
00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:08.604
Well, will you stay with me
no matter what?

33
00:03:08.897 --> 00:03:10.815
Of course, Charlie.

34
00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:15.695
What if I had to move to the Arctic
and you could never come home

35
00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:20.491
and had to eat whale blubber for the rest
of your life? Would you still stay with me?

36
00:03:20.576 --> 00:03:22.368
Yeah, I'd stay.

37
00:03:25.706 --> 00:03:27.874
But I hope that never happens.

38
00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.001
Yeah, me too.

39
00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.175
Well, by springtime
they had made it official.

40
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.178
Boy, let me tell you,
that was some wedding.

41
00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:44.056
It was presided over
by Father Ken Gumbert,

42
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:48.185
and half of the Rhode Island
State Police Force was in attendance.

43
00:03:51.315 --> 00:03:54.483
- Congratulations, Charlie.
- Thank you, Captain.

44
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.670
All right!

45
00:04:17.925 --> 00:04:19.842
Look what I got!

46
00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.387
Here you go.

47
00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:35.232
Excuse me, do you people take checks?

48
00:04:35.484 --> 00:04:39.612
Say that again. Do "we people"
take checks? You mean a black man?

49
00:04:39.947 --> 00:04:42.281
No, no, no, no! God, no. Your company.

50
00:04:42.366 --> 00:04:45.451
Don't give me that bullshit!
That was a racist slur.

51
00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:49.705
- No, it wasn't. I would never...
- Tell you what, I'll make it easy for you.

52
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.376
Why don't you just pay me in cotton
or a cartload of watermelons?

53
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:59.674
Or how's about some fried chicken, 'cause
you know black people love fried chicken!

54
00:04:59.758 --> 00:05:01.801
- Hey, no, come on now.
- What's going on?

55
00:05:01.885 --> 00:05:06.305
This cat don't believe a nigger knows how
to cash a check! Ain't that 'bout a bitch?

56
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.558
Charlie, I don't wanna ever hear you
use the n-word in this house.

57
00:05:09.643 --> 00:05:13.980
What!
I never said anything remotely racist!

58
00:05:14.064 --> 00:05:17.775
- Oh, so it's a "little people" thing, then.
- No!

59
00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:22.571
You think just 'cause I'm small you can
push me around? Come on, let's boogie.

60
00:05:22.656 --> 00:05:26.033
I'm gonna give you a little lesson
in low center of gravity.

61
00:05:27.911 --> 00:05:31.455
Stop it! Cut it... Stop it now. Sir!

62
00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:34.083
Don't patronize me with that "Sir" crap!

63
00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:36.752
Hey, those are illegal. Stop.

64
00:05:42.134 --> 00:05:44.385
Oh, it's on now. It's on!

65
00:05:47.097 --> 00:05:49.557
- Charlie, don't hit him!
- Me?

66
00:05:49.641 --> 00:05:53.477
Charlie! Stop it! Charlie, stop it!

67
00:05:54.563 --> 00:05:56.522
Let me handle this. Stop it!

68
00:05:58.066 --> 00:06:01.944
Excuse me, Mr. Jackson...

69
00:06:03.155 --> 00:06:05.698
Stop it! Wait. What is your first name?

70
00:06:06.116 --> 00:06:07.658
It's Shonté.

71
00:06:08.744 --> 00:06:13.956
Shonté, I am so, so sorry. I apologize.

72
00:06:14.041 --> 00:06:16.876
Come on here.
Let me walk you to your car.

73
00:06:17.753 --> 00:06:20.755
I have no patience for people
who judge books by their cover.

74
00:06:20.922 --> 00:06:22.631
And you shouldn't have to!

75
00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:26.510
Treating me like a dumbshit!
I mean, who does he think he's talking to?

76
00:06:26.762 --> 00:06:29.555
I'm a professor of molecular genetics
at Brown.

77
00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:32.183
And I'm head
of the Boston chapter of Mensa.

78
00:06:32.768 --> 00:06:35.061
- You're kidding?
- No.

79
00:06:35.145 --> 00:06:38.731
I'm just driving this limo
as a sociological experiment. That's it.

80
00:06:38.815 --> 00:06:42.943
But Mensa?
I'm president of the Providence chapter.

81
00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:45.362
No kidding.

82
00:06:51.203 --> 00:06:54.955
Just when Charlie thought
life couldn't get any sweeter,

83
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.918
old Mr. Stork dropped in
to pay him and Layla a visit.

84
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.838
It's a boy!

85
00:07:03.799 --> 00:07:06.842
Oh boy, oy, oy.

86
00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:11.055
Wow!

87
00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:14.225
He's so...

88
00:07:16.645 --> 00:07:18.104
Wow!

89
00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:23.567
Whoa, you're in luck!

90
00:07:23.985 --> 00:07:26.070
He's got company!

91
00:07:27.572 --> 00:07:29.365
Push! Push!

92
00:07:30.826 --> 00:07:35.121
Charlie loved those boys so much,
he just couldn't face the truth.

93
00:07:35.247 --> 00:07:39.041
And so he went on with his life
as if everything was normal.

94
00:07:42.254 --> 00:07:43.838
Hey, Finneran.

95
00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:45.214
Hey, buddy.

96
00:07:46.424 --> 00:07:49.301
- Hope you brought your appetite with you.
- Oh, I did.

97
00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:53.556
- Charlie, your kids look great.
- Yeah, don't they? Thanks.

98
00:07:56.726 --> 00:07:58.394
Charlie,

99
00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.021
just between you and me,

100
00:08:01.273 --> 00:08:04.733
d'you ever notice
that your kids have a year-round tan?

101
00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:06.944
Yeah, well...

102
00:08:07.904 --> 00:08:11.157
- My great-grandmother's half-ltalian.
- Half-ltalian?

103
00:08:12.909 --> 00:08:16.745
Well, that's probably why
the water beads off the hair, huh?

104
00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:23.711
Yeah, so? I mean, a lot of people
have different kind of hair.

105
00:08:24.254 --> 00:08:26.797
What are you getting at?

106
00:08:26.882 --> 00:08:29.175
Well, no, I'm just saying it's...

107
00:08:30.802 --> 00:08:34.597
Come on, goddamn it! Those kids' dicks
are bigger than them sausages!

108
00:08:35.015 --> 00:08:37.433
Knock it off!
You're talking about my children.

109
00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:40.686
- Since you brought it up, I wanna ask...
- Finneran!

110
00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.105
Get over here. It's your turn.

111
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.653
Charlie...

112
00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:54.116
Don't mind me.
It's just the beer talking, you know?

113
00:08:55.827 --> 00:08:57.161
Sure.

114
00:09:03.668 --> 00:09:08.464
There's something powerful
bubbling up inside me, Father.

115
00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:12.509
And I'm afraid that some day,

116
00:09:15.138 --> 00:09:17.973
if I don't do something, I'm gonna explode.

117
00:09:21.228 --> 00:09:23.938
Where does this rage come from, my son?

118
00:09:24.022 --> 00:09:26.941
I don't know. It's a lot of things, really.

119
00:09:28.151 --> 00:09:30.110
Take my wife, for example.

120
00:09:30.362 --> 00:09:32.488
I love her like no other, but...

121
00:09:32.822 --> 00:09:36.200
Part of me suspects
that she may be having an affair.

122
00:09:36.493 --> 00:09:40.788
And I'm probably
just being paranoid here, but...

123
00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:46.835
I get the feeling that the entire town
is laughing at me behind my back.

124
00:09:48.505 --> 00:09:50.673
Charlie, that you?

125
00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:55.970
Eventually,
Charlie's worst fears were realized.

126
00:09:56.096 --> 00:09:57.846
I'm so sorry, Charlie.

127
00:09:59.224 --> 00:10:01.350
Really, I am.

128
00:10:01.893 --> 00:10:03.811
But I have to do this.

129
00:10:04.521 --> 00:10:06.355
I found my soul mate.

130
00:10:07.023 --> 00:10:08.732
But...

131
00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:11.360
I thought I was your soul mate.

132
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.824
Come on, legs! Let's roll, baby.

133
00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:20.703
I don't know what to say.

134
00:10:21.288 --> 00:10:24.498
I guess the heart just wants
what the heart wants.

135
00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:28.711
Bye, Charlie.

136
00:10:31.339 --> 00:10:33.924
But you said you'd eat whale blubber.

137
00:10:34.301 --> 00:10:38.304
She'll be eating blubber all right,
just as soon as I free willy.

138
00:10:53.737 --> 00:10:57.531
It's funny how a man reacts
when his heart gets broken.

139
00:10:57.824 --> 00:11:00.451
Some break down and cry like a baby.

140
00:11:00.577 --> 00:11:03.829
Others, they take out an Uzi
and climb a clock tower.

141
00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:07.082
But Charlie Baileygates
didn't seem to react at all.

142
00:11:07.292 --> 00:11:13.047
He just swallowed hard, felt that slab of
heartache slide over the lump in his throat

143
00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:15.591
and he locked it all away.

144
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:21.638
As you can imagine,

145
00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:26.185
it wasn't easy for little Jamaal,
Lee Harvey and Shonté Junior

146
00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:28.145
growing up without a mom.

147
00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:32.024
But Charlie made that little house
into a big old home,

148
00:11:32.108 --> 00:11:33.984
and the boys flourished.

149
00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:37.112
Let me tell you, they were smart ones.

150
00:11:37.364 --> 00:11:40.783
- What are you building, fellas?
- An airplane, Daddy.

151
00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:47.081
Bye-bye!

152
00:11:47.165 --> 00:11:50.501
Bye, Daddy! Have a good time at work.

153
00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:55.923
Love you, Daddy!

154
00:12:01.971 --> 00:12:04.890
No! Hey, stop it!

155
00:12:05.183 --> 00:12:07.351
Get... Jamaal, you're in a lot of trouble!

156
00:12:07.602 --> 00:12:10.229
Get off that! Don't you take off in that!

157
00:12:11.815 --> 00:12:15.067
How many seas must a white...

158
00:12:15.151 --> 00:12:19.405
Shonté Junior, how can you keep
eating that crap and never gain weight?

159
00:12:19.489 --> 00:12:21.865
I don't know. Just lucky, I guess.

160
00:12:23.201 --> 00:12:28.414
- How many times must the cannonballs...
- Do you believe his voice?

161
00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:33.585
- That's Gomer Pyle!
- Before they're forever banned?

162
00:12:33.795 --> 00:12:36.672
Daddy, can we watch Richard Pryor
on HBO?

163
00:12:37.715 --> 00:12:39.675
Richard Pryor?

164
00:12:39.926 --> 00:12:41.844
Please.

165
00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:43.554
Okay.

166
00:12:45.682 --> 00:12:48.267
In Africa, though, I go out in the country.

167
00:12:48.893 --> 00:12:52.896
You see some lions and shit.
I'm talkin' about real lions.

168
00:12:52.981 --> 00:12:56.066
Not them kind
you be fuckin' with in the zoo.

169
00:12:56.151 --> 00:12:59.361
You know how you go fuck with a lion?
"Hey, lion! Motherfucker!"

170
00:13:01.698 --> 00:13:04.450
Be throwin' shit at it. Lion'd be "Oh,
ooh."

171
00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:09.413
As they have a way of doing,
the years passed somewhat regularly.

172
00:13:09.706 --> 00:13:13.000
And the boys, well,
they came into their own.

173
00:13:15.462 --> 00:13:17.087
...toss my salad!

174
00:13:18.673 --> 00:13:20.883
The guy's like "Toss my salad?
What's that?"

175
00:13:21.551 --> 00:13:27.681
Having your salad tossed means having
your asshole eaten out with jelly or syrup.

176
00:13:27.891 --> 00:13:29.808
I prefer syrup.

177
00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:33.228
He's a funny motherfucker!

178
00:13:37.734 --> 00:13:43.238
Although Charlie's police work had started
to suffer, the kids were doing great.

179
00:13:43.615 --> 00:13:47.242
Damn! I can't figure out the atomic mass
of this motherfuckin' deuteron.

180
00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:51.121
Shit. Man, that shit's simple. Lookit.

181
00:13:51.206 --> 00:13:53.499
- Tell me this, tell me this.
- What?

182
00:13:54.584 --> 00:13:56.376
What's a deuteron made up of?

183
00:13:57.253 --> 00:13:58.754
Duh! A proton and a neutron.

184
00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:02.508
Then what's this motherfuckin' electron
doin' right there?

185
00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:06.762
- Shit, I don't know.
- Well, get it out of there then!

186
00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:09.014
OK, so you're sayin'
I add up the atomic masses

187
00:14:09.098 --> 00:14:11.099
of the proton and the neutron, right?

188
00:14:11.184 --> 00:14:14.895
I sees that, but what do I do with
the goddamn electron? Can I put it here?

189
00:14:15.188 --> 00:14:18.941
Enrico Fermi'd roll over in his
motherfuckin' grave if he heard that.

190
00:14:19.025 --> 00:14:21.527
He'd just turn over ass up in yo' face.

191
00:14:21.611 --> 00:14:23.654
Man, Jamaal.
Just cut my man some slack.

192
00:14:23.738 --> 00:14:26.031
I'm just trying to help him save face.

193
00:14:26.115 --> 00:14:29.201
He keep askin' questions,
they'll think he's stupid.

194
00:14:29.285 --> 00:14:31.036
- L ain't stupid.
- Mornin', fellas.

195
00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.914
Hey, Pops, how you doin', man?

196
00:14:33.998 --> 00:14:37.417
- What's all the commotion?
- Oh, just school shit and shit.

197
00:14:37.502 --> 00:14:39.878
- How's my little guy doing?
- Struggling.

198
00:14:39.963 --> 00:14:44.007
Quantum physics is confusing. lf I don't
buckle down, I'll get myself another B+.

199
00:14:44.092 --> 00:14:45.801
Oh, that'd be whack.

200
00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:49.137
He's so fucking dumb,
he thinks calculus is a goddamn emperor.

201
00:14:50.098 --> 00:14:51.139
Give it up, dawg.

202
00:14:51.224 --> 00:14:54.309
Well, you think polypeptide's
a motherfuckin' toothpaste.

203
00:14:54.644 --> 00:14:57.521
Oh, I gotta get out of here.
I don't wanna have to bust a cap.

204
00:14:59.649 --> 00:15:00.857
Kisses.

205
00:15:02.527 --> 00:15:04.319
Daddy.

206
00:15:04.404 --> 00:15:06.446
- See ya later.
- Love ya.

207
00:15:07.574 --> 00:15:11.535
Yeah, Charlie was getting
a lot of respect inside the house.

208
00:15:11.869 --> 00:15:15.706
But outside...
Well, that was another story.

209
00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:22.671
Mornin', Ed.

210
00:15:23.798 --> 00:15:25.007
Charlie.

211
00:15:25.967 --> 00:15:28.176
Ed, did you see
where my paper went today?

212
00:15:28.595 --> 00:15:30.637
The wife's got it in the shitter.

213
00:15:32.557 --> 00:15:36.685
Well, could you tell her to throw it
on the porch when she's done?

214
00:15:37.937 --> 00:15:40.022
Can't you get one at work?

215
00:15:44.027 --> 00:15:45.235
Yeah...

216
00:15:46.571 --> 00:15:48.280
I suppose I could.

217
00:15:48.573 --> 00:15:50.032
You betcha.

218
00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:02.669
I'd like that

219
00:16:02.754 --> 00:16:07.424
If we could cycle down some lane

220
00:16:07.925 --> 00:16:11.136
I'd like that

221
00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:15.265
If we could ride into the rain

222
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:17.267
No macs, getting wet

223
00:16:17.477 --> 00:16:19.978
I'd be your Albert

224
00:16:20.063 --> 00:16:23.482
If you'd be Victoria

225
00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:29.237
Ha-ha, we'd laugh
because each drop would make me

226
00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:33.075
Grow up really high, really high

227
00:16:33.159 --> 00:16:37.162
Like a really high thing,
say a sunflower...

228
00:16:37.246 --> 00:16:39.956
- Hey, George, Herb.
- Hi, Charlie.

229
00:16:40.041 --> 00:16:42.501
- How do, fellas?
- Hi, Charlie.

230
00:16:43.002 --> 00:16:46.338
- Listen, Dick...
- Hey, guys, check out the rack on this one!

231
00:16:48.841 --> 00:16:52.302
Oh, yeah! That's what Daddy likes.

232
00:16:52.387 --> 00:16:54.346
It looks like a dead
heat in a zeppelin race.

233
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:58.100
- A couple of Hindenburgs, huh?
- Oh, the humanity!

234
00:16:58.184 --> 00:17:01.019
Come on, guys, take it easy. She's a mom.

235
00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:11.488
"She's a mom!"

236
00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:16.034
- She's a mom. Not my mom.
- She's a yummy mummy!

237
00:17:19.497 --> 00:17:21.456
You kill me!

238
00:17:27.755 --> 00:17:29.965
Sure, that is good.

239
00:17:32.885 --> 00:17:37.597
Listen, Dick,
I'm sorry to bother you like this but...

240
00:17:38.474 --> 00:17:41.810
Your car is gonna have to be moved.

241
00:17:42.687 --> 00:17:46.773
Yeah, sure, Charlie. OK. I should be
done here in another 1 0 or 1 5 minutes.

242
00:17:48.818 --> 00:17:51.486
I hate to be a stickler, Dick, but...

243
00:17:51.946 --> 00:17:54.281
The law says you can't park in one place
for over an hour,

244
00:17:54.365 --> 00:17:56.533
and you've been there for...

245
00:17:57.952 --> 00:17:59.995
Going on three days now.

246
00:18:01.497 --> 00:18:03.957
All right, all right. The law's the law.

247
00:18:05.293 --> 00:18:08.754
Park it up behind the grocery store,
will ya, Charlie?

248
00:18:12.759 --> 00:18:14.676
Yeah, sure.

249
00:18:17.013 --> 00:18:18.263
This one?

250
00:18:18.765 --> 00:18:23.810
There's an old saying: an ostrich with
his head in the sand makes a lousy cop.

251
00:18:23.895 --> 00:18:27.063
You see, if you can't deal
with your own problems,

252
00:18:27.148 --> 00:18:29.107
well, it's hard to deal with others.

253
00:18:29.192 --> 00:18:32.778
Sweetie? That's kinda dangerous.

254
00:18:32.862 --> 00:18:35.530
Wanna move it on to the sidewalk,
away from traffic?

255
00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:39.534
My dad says you're a joke
and I don't have to listen to you.

256
00:18:43.331 --> 00:18:47.334
Well,
your father is entitled to his opinion.

257
00:18:47.418 --> 00:18:50.629
But I am an officer of the law,
and, by all rights, I could...

258
00:18:50.713 --> 00:18:52.255
Fuck off!

259
00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:55.509
You should watch your mouth, little girl.

260
00:19:06.979 --> 00:19:08.814
Excuse me. Charlie!

261
00:19:08.898 --> 00:19:12.108
Hey! You mind if I get ahead of you?
I'm in a wicked rush.

262
00:19:12.193 --> 00:19:14.778
- Oh, yeah, sure. Go ahead.
- You're a doll.

263
00:19:14.862 --> 00:19:17.572
Hey, kids! Over here! Now!

264
00:19:19.742 --> 00:19:22.744
Didn't I tell you to stay with me?

265
00:19:35.591 --> 00:19:37.843
We're gonna rock you

266
00:20:06.706 --> 00:20:08.373
VagiClean, huh?

267
00:20:08.457 --> 00:20:11.835
What's the matter, honey?
Little extra cheese on the taco?

268
00:20:14.297 --> 00:20:16.381
- Excuse me?
- No, excuse me.

269
00:20:19.176 --> 00:20:20.635
There's no tag on this.

270
00:20:21.762 --> 00:20:24.180
Price check on VagiClean, aisle five.

271
00:20:24.265 --> 00:20:27.893
I repeat: price check on VagiClean,
aisle five.

272
00:20:27.977 --> 00:20:29.686
That's VagiClean.

273
00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:32.188
We got a customer with a fallopian fungus.

274
00:20:32.481 --> 00:20:35.525
She's baking bread
and I think it's sourdough.

275
00:20:39.488 --> 00:20:40.614
Put a rush on that.

276
00:20:42.867 --> 00:20:45.076
Hey, big guy. Did you hear the news?

277
00:20:45.494 --> 00:20:47.829
My son Billy
got the lead in the high-school musical.

278
00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:51.625
Well, I guess he likes the cock after all.

279
00:21:03.179 --> 00:21:06.306
- Still wanna skip rope in the street?
- L'll tell my daddy, Charlie!

280
00:21:06.766 --> 00:21:09.517
Wrong answer.
And the name's Hank, fuckface.

281
00:21:09.602 --> 00:21:12.354
Reciting memorized lines

282
00:21:13.147 --> 00:21:16.942
And I'm not fit to touch

283
00:21:17.443 --> 00:21:20.403
The hem of your garment

284
00:21:20.488 --> 00:21:24.908
No, no, I'm not fit to touch

285
00:21:25.493 --> 00:21:29.162
The hem of your garment

286
00:21:37.046 --> 00:21:39.881
I have no love but only goals

287
00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:44.344
How very empty is my soul

288
00:21:45.304 --> 00:21:48.598
It is a soul that could easily kill

289
00:21:53.729 --> 00:21:57.524
And I'm not fit to touch...

290
00:21:57.608 --> 00:22:00.694
There you go, Dick. I parked it for you.

291
00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:02.904
By the way,

292
00:22:06.409 --> 00:22:08.410
you got a headlight out.

293
00:22:51.704 --> 00:22:53.288
That looks good.

294
00:22:53.456 --> 00:22:56.791
- There you go, Colonel.
- Very good, Malcolm. Thank you.

295
00:22:57.209 --> 00:22:59.711
Colonel, something's wrong with Charlie.

296
00:22:59.795 --> 00:23:02.714
- 1 -X to 1 -1 2.
- 1 -1 2 responding.

297
00:23:05.134 --> 00:23:07.719
Of course, there's not much
about this sort of thing

298
00:23:07.803 --> 00:23:10.221
in the Rhode Island State Police manual.

299
00:23:10.306 --> 00:23:15.018
So they sent him up to Boston to see
a team of highly trained head doctors.

300
00:23:15.102 --> 00:23:17.645
They quickly identified the problem.

301
00:23:18.481 --> 00:23:20.648
You got a major screw loose.

302
00:23:22.026 --> 00:23:25.779
Doctors have diagnosed you
as having a "split personality."

303
00:23:25.863 --> 00:23:27.322
A schizo.

304
00:23:28.908 --> 00:23:32.410
- L don't remember this.
- That's because, according to that report,

305
00:23:32.495 --> 00:23:35.914
it wasn't you that this was happening to.
It was this other guy.

306
00:23:35.998 --> 00:23:37.123
Hank.

307
00:23:37.458 --> 00:23:41.169
- Said his name was Hank.
- And apparently Hank is trying to get out.

308
00:23:41.837 --> 00:23:44.089
Trying to get out?
What do you mean "get out"?

309
00:23:44.173 --> 00:23:46.257
- How did he get in?
- You created him.

310
00:23:46.342 --> 00:23:49.344
By not dealing
with your problems, Charlie.

311
00:23:50.763 --> 00:23:53.431
Ever since...

312
00:23:53.516 --> 00:23:57.644
Well, you know.
You've been avoiding confrontation.

313
00:23:58.354 --> 00:24:00.563
- But this guy inside.
- Hank.

314
00:24:00.648 --> 00:24:05.985
He doesn't. Doctors feel that you've
created this character out of necessity.

315
00:24:06.529 --> 00:24:07.946
You never stick up for yourself.

316
00:24:09.115 --> 00:24:12.826
Charlie, why didn't you take a vacation
when Layla left?

317
00:24:18.332 --> 00:24:19.791
Why would l?

318
00:24:19.875 --> 00:24:23.837
You know, wives leave their husbands
every day in this country.

319
00:24:24.672 --> 00:24:27.257
That's no reason
to short-change the department.

320
00:24:27.341 --> 00:24:30.009
I mean, it's not like I had the flu...

321
00:24:38.686 --> 00:24:41.271
Have you picked up your medication?

322
00:24:46.902 --> 00:24:51.447
I'm really not crazy about it, though.
It makes me so dry.

323
00:24:52.074 --> 00:24:53.199
You have to take it anyway.

324
00:24:53.284 --> 00:24:56.327
Dr. Rabinowitz assures us,
if you do, everything'll be fine.

325
00:24:56.412 --> 00:24:58.580
This is a bunch of crap!

326
00:24:59.373 --> 00:25:02.584
No wonder you're the smallest state.
Little mind, little state.

327
00:25:02.751 --> 00:25:05.211
Shouldn't even be a state.
Should be a district.

328
00:25:05.838 --> 00:25:08.256
Can you take these goddamn things off?

329
00:25:09.091 --> 00:25:11.092
And could you stop lookin' at my ass!

330
00:25:13.053 --> 00:25:15.013
Pritchard, what's going on here?

331
00:25:15.306 --> 00:25:17.515
Well, Colonel, her name's Waters, lrene P.

332
00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:20.435
I pulled her over on 95
for a broken tail light.

333
00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:24.689
I ran a check. She's got
an outstanding warrant in New York.

334
00:25:24.773 --> 00:25:26.816
- Hit and run?
- Hit and run.

335
00:25:26.901 --> 00:25:29.027
Injured pedestrian signed the complaint.

336
00:25:29.111 --> 00:25:32.864
Well, I think I might remember that.
That is ridiculous.

337
00:25:32.948 --> 00:25:35.533
I've never been in an accident.
Not in my whole life.

338
00:25:35.618 --> 00:25:39.495
Well, I've just gotten off the phone
with the New York State Patrol.

339
00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:42.457
They don't seem to
think it's so ridiculous.

340
00:25:44.084 --> 00:25:48.755
- Look... How can we fix...
- Were you in Massena last Friday?

341
00:25:48.839 --> 00:25:52.508
Well, yeah, I live there.
But I didn't have any accident.

342
00:25:53.427 --> 00:25:56.471
I'm just driving down to Block Island
to see my sister.

343
00:25:56.805 --> 00:25:59.807
You seem like a nice guy.
Is there any way that you might let me

344
00:25:59.892 --> 00:26:01.726
handle this by mail or...

345
00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:05.021
Unfortunately, Miss Waters,
I'm not the one you have to convince.

346
00:26:05.648 --> 00:26:09.150
If there's been a mistake,
you have to clear it up in Massena.

347
00:26:09.235 --> 00:26:13.279
What?
Because of somebody else's mistake,

348
00:26:13.364 --> 00:26:17.533
I have to get in my car and drive
all the way back to upstate New York?

349
00:26:26.627 --> 00:26:27.961
No, ma'am.

350
00:26:30.256 --> 00:26:33.007
We'll have one of our troopers escort you.

351
00:26:38.013 --> 00:26:40.598
Hey, Hollywood,
turn your fuckin' phone off.

352
00:26:40.683 --> 00:26:42.517
- Yeah?
- You're an asshole.

353
00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:44.769
Oh, hello, lrene. What'd I do now?

354
00:26:44.853 --> 00:26:47.605
Listen, I'm at a police station
in Rhode Island.

355
00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:50.525
They're shipping me back to Massena
on some bogus crap.

356
00:26:50.609 --> 00:26:53.278
- Sound familiar?
- L don't have a clue

357
00:26:53.362 --> 00:26:55.029
- what you're talkin' about.
- Dickie!

358
00:26:55.114 --> 00:26:56.698
Cut the bullshit!

359
00:27:01.036 --> 00:27:02.996
Listen to me, OK?

360
00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:05.581
It's over, Dickie. It's over.

361
00:27:05.666 --> 00:27:08.459
So please just stop messing with me

362
00:27:08.544 --> 00:27:11.629
and call your friends
and tell them to back off, OK?

363
00:27:11.714 --> 00:27:13.298
Look, I'm being a straight shooter.

364
00:27:13.382 --> 00:27:15.591
If you need help, I'll help you.

365
00:27:15.676 --> 00:27:20.054
Just give me all the details
and I'll get to the bottom of it.

366
00:27:21.223 --> 00:27:24.350
Massena, New York!
Goddamn, Daddy! That's near Canada!

367
00:27:24.435 --> 00:27:26.769
I know, I know. Wasn't my idea.

368
00:27:27.271 --> 00:27:28.855
I gotta take this gal up north,

369
00:27:28.939 --> 00:27:31.899
and then the colonel ordered me
to take a week's vacation.

370
00:27:31.984 --> 00:27:34.152
A week's a long motherfuckin' time.

371
00:27:34.236 --> 00:27:37.697
He wants me to rest
while I'm getting used to the medication.

372
00:27:37.781 --> 00:27:40.742
Oh, come on. You don't have to worry
about us, Daddy. We're grown up now.

373
00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:44.996
These two can do the shopping.
I'll do the cooking.

374
00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:49.000
You do the cooking? Man, you thought you
got chipped beef from a toothy blowjob!

375
00:27:49.084 --> 00:27:52.128
You're gonna have Shonté Junior
down or under goddamn 400lb. Fuck that.

376
00:27:53.839 --> 00:27:56.924
Can't have that happen. OK, guys.

377
00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:02.096
I'm not leaving till the morning, but you
know the rules: no bitches after eleven.

378
00:28:04.183 --> 00:28:06.601
- All right, Pops.
- Yeah, man.

379
00:28:06.685 --> 00:28:08.478
- Got you, Papa.
- Love you, Daddy!

380
00:28:11.607 --> 00:28:14.525
So who the hell's
this lrene honey anyway?

381
00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:17.153
She worked for me the past two years.

382
00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:21.324
I hired her to be my golf-course
superintendent. We got close.

383
00:28:21.408 --> 00:28:23.159
No, you got stupid!

384
00:28:25.079 --> 00:28:28.581
For the love of shit, these are
the loose ends that can hang you, Dickie!

385
00:28:28.665 --> 00:28:29.916
And me too!

386
00:28:30.292 --> 00:28:32.293
How much does she know?

387
00:28:32.544 --> 00:28:34.879
She might have gotten wind
of some things.

388
00:28:34.963 --> 00:28:37.340
Yeah, well, we're gonna find out.

389
00:28:37.466 --> 00:28:40.301
The complaint was signed
by a guy named Peterson.

390
00:28:40.386 --> 00:28:45.098
- He's with the EPA.
- EPA? I thought they were in our pocket.

391
00:28:45.682 --> 00:28:47.517
Well, not all of 'em.

392
00:28:48.352 --> 00:28:52.647
Even though Charlie didn't
wholeheartedly agree with the top brass,

393
00:28:52.731 --> 00:28:54.649
he did as he was told.

394
00:28:54.817 --> 00:28:57.693
- Careful on the road, Charlie.
- OK, Colonel.

395
00:29:02.908 --> 00:29:04.742
- Hang on, ma'am.
- Yeah.

396
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:16.462
This vacation is just what Charlie needs.

397
00:29:16.755 --> 00:29:19.465
I bet he's a new man when he gets back.

398
00:29:20.384 --> 00:29:22.135
If we let him back.

399
00:29:24.096 --> 00:29:25.763
What do you mean?

400
00:29:26.181 --> 00:29:29.642
Well, I mean that
he's become a pretty big liability.

401
00:29:30.644 --> 00:29:32.437
We may have to let him go.

402
00:29:33.147 --> 00:29:36.941
Let him go? But, Captain,
police work is Charlie's whole li...

403
00:29:37.025 --> 00:29:39.026
I know, I know, damn it.

404
00:29:40.237 --> 00:29:41.279
I know.

405
00:29:41.363 --> 00:29:46.367
I found you sittin' on a suitcase cryin'...

406
00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:52.081
It's a great time of year to ride,
as long as you don't mind one or two bugs.

407
00:29:56.378 --> 00:30:03.092
I laugh out loud 'cause it's the one thing
I hadn't been tryin'

408
00:30:04.595 --> 00:30:06.220
The train came in breathless

409
00:30:06.555 --> 00:30:08.014
The passengers restless

410
00:30:08.098 --> 00:30:11.601
He said "Baby, you'll never change"

411
00:30:11.685 --> 00:30:15.730
You gotta get goin', you gotta keep goin'

412
00:30:15.814 --> 00:30:19.358
Hey, the world ain't slowin' down

413
00:30:19.443 --> 00:30:20.860
For no one

414
00:30:20.944 --> 00:30:25.573
It's a carnival callin' out to you

415
00:30:27.659 --> 00:30:31.496
It sounds like a song
It hits you like Scripture...

416
00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:34.165
Boy, you can't beat the open road!

417
00:30:36.585 --> 00:30:41.839
Weren't you the kid
who just climbed on the merry-go-round?

418
00:30:41.965 --> 00:30:46.511
Hey, look, the world ain't slowin' down

419
00:30:48.889 --> 00:30:50.848
Oh, no.

420
00:30:51.141 --> 00:30:52.808
Oh, my goodness.

421
00:30:53.769 --> 00:30:55.186
Jeez.

422
00:30:56.438 --> 00:30:58.272
Those damn truckers.

423
00:30:58.815 --> 00:31:02.693
You know, you think they'd call someone
to come clean this up.

424
00:31:03.612 --> 00:31:07.156
Poor thing. That's terrible.

425
00:31:09.284 --> 00:31:11.953
By the looks of her,
she's been here for a while.

426
00:31:12.788 --> 00:31:16.374
Well, I doubt we're gonna be able
to move her, but we should try.

427
00:31:16.458 --> 00:31:18.584
You wanna get that end? Give it a push?

428
00:31:18.669 --> 00:31:21.128
- Really?
- Yeah, we should give it a shot.

429
00:31:22.297 --> 00:31:23.506
- OK?
- OK.

430
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:26.634
Go ahead. Just push as hard as you can.

431
00:31:26.718 --> 00:31:28.219
Yeah, OK.

432
00:31:29.763 --> 00:31:31.222
Jesus! Holy...

433
00:31:32.808 --> 00:31:34.559
- OK...
- It's still alive!

434
00:31:34.643 --> 00:31:38.396
- Just stand back. I'll take care of it.
- Oh, God! That's terrible.

435
00:31:40.357 --> 00:31:42.316
Now, don't look, OK?

436
00:31:48.448 --> 00:31:49.991
Well, old girl.

437
00:31:51.743 --> 00:31:53.661
Your suffering's over.

438
00:32:01.169 --> 00:32:05.381
Oh, it ain't always easy
doing Mother Nature's work.

439
00:32:18.186 --> 00:32:20.271
- Do you believe that?
- No, it's...

440
00:32:22.357 --> 00:32:24.150
My God in heaven!

441
00:32:29.031 --> 00:32:30.531
What is wrong with you?

442
00:32:30.699 --> 00:32:31.782
Die!

443
00:32:34.703 --> 00:32:35.786
Let go! Let go, girl!

444
00:32:35.871 --> 00:32:40.875
On to greener pastures, come on. They're
clear-cutting a place in heaven for ya.

445
00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:43.044
Come on! Help me out!

446
00:32:43.128 --> 00:32:44.545
- But...
- Do something!

447
00:32:45.047 --> 00:32:47.715
- L don't...
- Let go!

448
00:32:49.801 --> 00:32:52.386
Let go! Go!

449
00:33:02.898 --> 00:33:04.273
Well,

450
00:33:04.816 --> 00:33:06.734
that was tough, but...

451
00:33:07.819 --> 00:33:10.154
I think we did the right thing.

452
00:33:22.125 --> 00:33:25.252
Patrol car, yes. OK, thank you.

453
00:33:27.172 --> 00:33:30.007
- Can I help you?
- Baileygates, Rhode Island State Police.

454
00:33:30.092 --> 00:33:33.302
I have your prisoner,
Miss lrene Waters, here.

455
00:33:34.137 --> 00:33:38.015
- All right. I'll tell them you're here.
- Okay-dee, ray-dee.

456
00:33:49.569 --> 00:33:51.904
What are those for?

457
00:33:52.114 --> 00:33:55.116
Oh, it's just this stupid thing.

458
00:33:55.325 --> 00:34:00.371
I have to take a pill every six hours
or I feel funny. No big deal.

459
00:34:01.456 --> 00:34:03.791
What's it called?

460
00:34:03.875 --> 00:34:08.170
Advanced delusionary schizophrenia
with involuntary narcissistic rage.

461
00:34:14.094 --> 00:34:16.345
Does your ass feel numb?

462
00:34:17.973 --> 00:34:19.473
No, but...

463
00:34:20.559 --> 00:34:23.185
They give me unbelievable cottonmouth.

464
00:34:23.353 --> 00:34:26.731
- L meant from the ride.
- Oh. No, no.

465
00:34:26.982 --> 00:34:29.400
Over the years
my ass has taken a pounding.

466
00:34:32.112 --> 00:34:35.948
My name's Peterson.
This is my partner, Agent Boshane.

467
00:34:36.032 --> 00:34:39.577
We're with the Environmental Protection
Agency's Special Investigations.

468
00:34:39.661 --> 00:34:40.828
The EPA?

469
00:34:41.204 --> 00:34:43.914
What'd I hit? A baldheaded eagle?

470
00:34:44.166 --> 00:34:48.669
We'll explain that to you, ma'am, but right
now we're gonna ask you to come with us.

471
00:34:51.173 --> 00:34:54.175
Well, why don't you just
explain it to me now?

472
00:34:55.677 --> 00:35:00.931
We put your hit-and-run report out
on the wire in order to track you down.

473
00:35:01.224 --> 00:35:03.225
Track me down for what?

474
00:35:03.935 --> 00:35:05.853
Agent Boshane?

475
00:35:07.856 --> 00:35:11.609
I want to remind you again,
our station's at your disposal.

476
00:35:11.985 --> 00:35:14.445
You're welcome to use
our interrogation rooms.

477
00:35:14.529 --> 00:35:17.948
We appreciate it, Lieutenant Gerke,
but we're all set.

478
00:35:19.201 --> 00:35:22.203
Right. Well,
if there's anything at all l...

479
00:35:35.717 --> 00:35:37.134
Excuse me.

480
00:35:37.302 --> 00:35:38.511
I'm just gonna...

481
00:35:39.846 --> 00:35:42.181
Get myself a drink of water.

482
00:35:49.856 --> 00:35:55.820
So, if I could just get someone
to sign this, I'll be on my way.

483
00:35:55.904 --> 00:35:57.071
Yeah.

484
00:35:59.449 --> 00:36:03.911
Well, Miss Waters, good luck.
I hope everything works out great for you.

485
00:36:04.162 --> 00:36:05.287
Thanks a lot, Charlie.

486
00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:10.251
I haven't done anything wrong
and you know it.

487
00:36:11.753 --> 00:36:16.507
What about the marijuana roaches you left
when you moved out of your apartment?

488
00:36:17.008 --> 00:36:19.760
So I smoked some pot.
What is that, a crime?

489
00:36:22.514 --> 00:36:25.432
As is being an accessory
to bribery, embezzlement,

490
00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:29.520
- tax evasion and racketeering.
- What are you talking about?

491
00:36:29.604 --> 00:36:32.439
Does the name Dickie Thurman ring a bell?

492
00:36:33.441 --> 00:36:38.112
His company, Cedar Creek Limited, has
been under investigation for 1 8 months.

493
00:36:38.196 --> 00:36:42.533
How does that make me an accessory? I
laid sod on Dickie's golf course. So what?

494
00:36:42.617 --> 00:36:46.620
Tell me this. A big operation
like the Cedar Creek Country Club.

495
00:36:47.455 --> 00:36:49.790
How'd you become
the head greenskeeper?

496
00:36:49.875 --> 00:36:51.250
By default.

497
00:36:51.626 --> 00:36:56.881
This guy, Tedeschi or Tedesco,
he was hired before me, but he died.

498
00:36:56.965 --> 00:36:58.507
Heart problem or something.

499
00:37:00.635 --> 00:37:04.513
The feds believed that lrene
knew more than she thought she knew,

500
00:37:04.598 --> 00:37:06.348
and her life was in danger.

501
00:37:06.975 --> 00:37:10.728
They explained that everything
had been happening under her nose.

502
00:37:10.812 --> 00:37:14.732
Payoffs of government agencies,
threats to those who stood in the way.

503
00:37:14.816 --> 00:37:20.696
And her predecessor's heart attack?
Well, that was just cold-blooded murder.

504
00:37:21.323 --> 00:37:23.282
Oh, man!

505
00:37:31.833 --> 00:37:33.500
Can you excuse me?

506
00:37:52.687 --> 00:37:54.021
Pizza kid.

507
00:37:57.525 --> 00:38:00.527
- How much?
- That comes to $1 3.95.

508
00:38:25.553 --> 00:38:27.513
Son of a bitch!

509
00:38:44.656 --> 00:38:47.199
It was a good thing Charlie had told her

510
00:38:47.283 --> 00:38:51.537
he was staying at the Chuck E. Cheese
Lodge and Miniature Golf Resort.

511
00:38:52.455 --> 00:38:53.664
Charlie?

512
00:38:53.748 --> 00:38:57.960
Lrene finagled the key from the front desk
and let herself in.

513
00:38:58.294 --> 00:38:59.586
Charlie!

514
00:39:10.348 --> 00:39:12.933
Charlie, what's going on here?

515
00:39:13.018 --> 00:39:14.518
Lrene?

516
00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:21.650
Lrene, I was just...
I was gonna study your file

517
00:39:21.735 --> 00:39:24.194
and try to find a loophole.

518
00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:30.117
Did your lips get as chapped as mine
on the ride down?

519
00:39:30.201 --> 00:39:32.036
Never mind. I need your help.

520
00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:35.622
There was a shootout at the thing.
The agents are dead!

521
00:39:35.957 --> 00:39:38.417
- Dead?
- Yeah. They were after me, Charlie!

522
00:39:38.543 --> 00:39:41.462
Oh, God. This is Dickie's work. I know it!

523
00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:47.843
So what are you gonna do?

524
00:39:49.179 --> 00:39:52.056
- We'll call the police.
- What? No, you can't do that!

525
00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:56.268
Dickie has those guys in his back pocket.
That's why I came to you.

526
00:39:57.479 --> 00:39:59.813
Hey! This is serious shit!

527
00:40:00.106 --> 00:40:01.190
You don't...

528
00:40:02.442 --> 00:40:05.027
- l'm outta here.
- Hey, wait! No, don't do that!

529
00:40:05.111 --> 00:40:07.905
Come on, hold on.
Just let me think for a second. OK?

530
00:40:07.989 --> 00:40:11.784
Think someplace else.
This is the first place they're gonna look.

531
00:40:11.868 --> 00:40:13.827
Damn it!

532
00:40:21.169 --> 00:40:23.629
So where are we going anyway?

533
00:40:23.713 --> 00:40:25.130
You'll see.

534
00:40:26.716 --> 00:40:32.304
Well, they went on the lam for a bit, and
then Charlie made a couple of phone calls.

535
00:40:42.857 --> 00:40:44.775
Take it easy now.

536
00:40:44.859 --> 00:40:47.569
- Charlie!
- Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

537
00:40:48.029 --> 00:40:49.863
Hey.

538
00:40:50.031 --> 00:40:52.324
- Good work, Baileygates.
- Thanks.

539
00:40:52.408 --> 00:40:54.284
Sorry I had to meet you
all the way out here.

540
00:40:54.369 --> 00:40:57.746
- That's OK.
- It's just as well. Poor gal's paranoid.

541
00:40:57.831 --> 00:41:02.042
My kids are like that. They have this idea
that the cops are the bad guys...

542
00:41:09.342 --> 00:41:13.220
Listen, I don't know what's going on
and I didn't tell the feds anything...

543
00:41:13.304 --> 00:41:16.765
Dickie told me you were street-smart.

544
00:41:17.267 --> 00:41:19.726
Why the hell would you run to this idiot?

545
00:41:25.191 --> 00:41:26.984
Drop the gun, moron.

546
00:41:27.569 --> 00:41:29.236
You're being video-taped.

547
00:41:30.864 --> 00:41:34.199
- What're you talking about?
- There's a camera on my bike.

548
00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:40.914
Hard to hit a moving target, isn't it?

549
00:41:57.098 --> 00:41:59.308
Score. Good move.

550
00:41:59.767 --> 00:42:01.268
Get in the car.

551
00:42:02.979 --> 00:42:05.105
Come on, come on, come on.

552
00:42:08.943 --> 00:42:12.070
D'you mind telling me
what you were thinking?

553
00:42:12.155 --> 00:42:14.781
Calling that cop was unbelievably stupid!

554
00:42:17.952 --> 00:42:20.787
Tweak the high end
on your emotional EQ, sweetbeak.

555
00:42:20.872 --> 00:42:23.415
The funky chicken was Charlie's dance.

556
00:42:23.499 --> 00:42:26.084
I'm a tango man myself.

557
00:42:31.883 --> 00:42:35.260
As you can imagine,
there was some explaining to do.

558
00:42:35.345 --> 00:42:39.223
So Hank, as he called himself,

559
00:42:39.307 --> 00:42:43.685
found a quiet spot
and spelled out the whole darn mess.

560
00:42:43.770 --> 00:42:46.813
OK, so what you're saying
is that you're not Charlie.

561
00:42:47.482 --> 00:42:51.568
You've seen Charlie in action.
He's like origami: folds under pressure.

562
00:42:51.653 --> 00:42:54.821
When the big game's on the line,
he's busy riding the pine.

563
00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:58.033
OK, wait. Can you just...

564
00:43:02.872 --> 00:43:04.831
It's simple.

565
00:43:05.458 --> 00:43:07.334
Charlie's the mouse
that got you into the maze.

566
00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:10.295
I'm the rat who can find the cheese.

567
00:43:11.005 --> 00:43:13.715
The name's Hank. Hank Evans...

568
00:43:14.509 --> 00:43:16.760
For little girls

569
00:43:17.303 --> 00:43:20.430
So it's true. Charlie is a schizo.

570
00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:25.018
I wouldn't know. I stay out of
his business, he stays out of mine.

571
00:43:25.979 --> 00:43:27.396
Look.

572
00:43:30.566 --> 00:43:33.819
Just because I rock
doesn't mean I'm made of stone.

573
00:43:33.903 --> 00:43:38.156
I feel your fear. It's coming through
like static on my heart radio.

574
00:43:40.785 --> 00:43:42.744
Hank? Hank.

575
00:43:44.497 --> 00:43:47.207
I really, really appreciate your help,

576
00:43:47.667 --> 00:43:51.712
but is there any way that maybe we could
get Charlie back out here

577
00:43:51.796 --> 00:43:53.547
for a little huddle?

578
00:43:54.674 --> 00:43:56.049
No problem.

579
00:43:56.134 --> 00:43:59.469
While you're at it, why not climb that pole
and take a piss on the power lines?

580
00:43:59.554 --> 00:44:02.139
Look, I'm not here to twist your niblets.

581
00:44:02.223 --> 00:44:07.436
I'm here to save your life, but if I'm gonna
do that, I'll need total uninononynymity.

582
00:44:13.067 --> 00:44:14.276
OK.

583
00:44:15.069 --> 00:44:16.987
Sound good, candypants?

584
00:44:17.989 --> 00:44:20.073
Hank, don't call me that.

585
00:44:32.337 --> 00:44:34.504
How the hell can they call Pluto a planet?

586
00:44:34.589 --> 00:44:36.798
What motherfuckin' planet has
an elliptical orbit?

587
00:44:36.883 --> 00:44:40.552
- This shit don't make sense.
- Motherfucker!

588
00:44:40.636 --> 00:44:44.139
That motherfucker Vince Foster was
murdered. I told you that shit!

589
00:44:44.223 --> 00:44:47.434
Hey, man, quit hackin' into
them goddamn Pentagon files.

590
00:44:47.518 --> 00:44:51.980
Ain't no nevermind who them crooked
politicians be killin'. You need to study.

591
00:44:52.315 --> 00:44:54.941
- What did Daddy tell you about snoopin'?
- Shit, yeah.

592
00:44:55.026 --> 00:44:58.653
If you keep fuckin' around,
you'll lose your Yale scholarship.

593
00:44:58.738 --> 00:45:03.784
Be stuck up there at Stanford with
them goddamn motherfuckers.

594
00:45:03.868 --> 00:45:06.036
Motherfucker, you be lucky
to get accepted to Duke,

595
00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:07.913
gettin' a 1430 on yo' SAT.

596
00:45:07.997 --> 00:45:09.558
- Motherfucker, you know I had the flu.
- Flu, my ass!

597
00:45:09.582 --> 00:45:12.834
You had a motherfuckin' aneurysm
to get a 1430.

598
00:45:12.919 --> 00:45:16.254
Hey, you talkin' some shit now.

599
00:45:16.339 --> 00:45:19.633
That's probably one of them
lvy League sons of bitches now.

600
00:45:19.717 --> 00:45:21.885
Show me yo' ass head up
and get the door, man.

601
00:45:25.765 --> 00:45:27.516
Hey, Captain.

602
00:45:27.809 --> 00:45:30.560
- Fellas.
- What the fuck is goin' on, man?

603
00:45:30.978 --> 00:45:33.647
- This is Agent Annicelli.
- Gentlemen.

604
00:45:34.649 --> 00:45:36.817
- What's happenin'?
- We've got a problem.

605
00:45:37.819 --> 00:45:38.985
Pack your bags.

606
00:45:45.159 --> 00:45:46.910
- We're locked and loaded.
- Great.

607
00:45:46.994 --> 00:45:49.329
Got enough stuff
to hold us over for 72 hours.

608
00:46:04.137 --> 00:46:06.304
Well, fuck my ozone.

609
00:46:23.322 --> 00:46:25.240
We're gonna rock you

610
00:46:33.416 --> 00:46:34.916
Hey, ringworm.

611
00:46:38.129 --> 00:46:40.213
Yeah, I'm talkin' to you,
you toxic waste of life.

612
00:46:42.925 --> 00:46:44.676
You gonna pick up that butt?

613
00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:48.638
Or do I have to glue it to my shoe
and stick it in your pimply a-hole?

614
00:46:48.723 --> 00:46:52.559
Hey, man. Take it easy.
It's just a cigarette.

615
00:46:52.643 --> 00:46:53.894
Oh, yeah?

616
00:46:55.062 --> 00:46:59.483
Well, this is just a fist, but when I throw
it around, it can leave one hell of a mess.

617
00:47:00.401 --> 00:47:01.818
Let's dance.

618
00:47:24.091 --> 00:47:26.301
Let's kick the shit out of
this crazy asshole!

619
00:47:26.844 --> 00:47:29.930
Wait, he's a schizo!

620
00:47:30.431 --> 00:47:32.098
What the hell's wrong with him?

621
00:47:34.435 --> 00:47:35.936
What happened anyway?

622
00:47:37.271 --> 00:47:41.816
Yeah, Charlie was taking a few lumps
on account of Hank's behavior.

623
00:47:41.901 --> 00:47:46.154
But, save for a little blood in the urine,
he was no worse for the wear.

624
00:47:48.616 --> 00:47:51.618
I'm sorry you had to meet Hank,
Miss Waters.

625
00:47:51.702 --> 00:47:52.994
I thought I was bad.

626
00:47:53.829 --> 00:47:56.414
That guy has some serious problems.

627
00:47:57.833 --> 00:47:59.751
He did save our lives.

628
00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:04.881
Anyway, Hank had a good idea.
He thinks...

629
00:48:04.966 --> 00:48:06.383
You're gonna listen to Hank?

630
00:48:06.467 --> 00:48:10.971
Come on, look what he did to me!
What are you thinking? He's out of control.

631
00:48:13.057 --> 00:48:14.724
You know what we should do?

632
00:48:14.809 --> 00:48:18.603
Find another department
and tell them the whole story.

633
00:48:18.688 --> 00:48:22.524
Not smart, Charlie. We don't know how far
Dickie's reach goes.

634
00:48:24.569 --> 00:48:26.486
Then you know what?

635
00:48:26.571 --> 00:48:30.991
I think it's time to call the best damn
law enforcement agency in the country.

636
00:48:31.158 --> 00:48:33.493
The Rhode Island State Troopers!

637
00:48:33.619 --> 00:48:34.619
Do you really think

638
00:48:34.704 --> 00:48:38.164
that the feds don't have some guy
up there right now, bugging calls?

639
00:48:38.249 --> 00:48:43.253
They'd be on us in 1 0 minutes. And they
almost got me killed in the first place.

640
00:48:43.963 --> 00:48:45.338
OK.

641
00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:47.716
What was the genius's big plan?

642
00:48:48.134 --> 00:48:51.219
He thinks that we should find a cabin
and hide out for a while.

643
00:48:51.721 --> 00:48:53.847
Oh, yeah?
What about water and food and...

644
00:48:53.931 --> 00:48:57.017
He already got supplies.
They're in the trunk.

645
00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:09.696
These are the supplies?

646
00:49:13.034 --> 00:49:15.327
Well, he had a plan, all right.

647
00:49:16.537 --> 00:49:19.122
That's it? That's all he got?

648
00:49:19.248 --> 00:49:21.207
Oh, no. There's more.

649
00:49:22.335 --> 00:49:23.668
A rope,

650
00:49:23.919 --> 00:49:25.462
shovel,

651
00:49:26.631 --> 00:49:29.507
bag of lime and some lawn darts.

652
00:49:32.219 --> 00:49:35.972
This is Christine DiCarlo live
from Clinton County, New York,

653
00:49:36.057 --> 00:49:40.060
where the manhunt continues for
Rhode Island State Trooper Baileygates.

654
00:49:40.144 --> 00:49:42.479
...responsible for the death
of an EPA agent

655
00:49:42.563 --> 00:49:44.105
and the kidnapping of lrene Waters.

656
00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:48.693
Bullshit! My daddy ain't killed nobody
and he sure ain't kidnapped no bitch!

657
00:49:48.778 --> 00:49:51.154
Your dad's sick, mentally.
He's had a breakdown.

658
00:49:52.073 --> 00:49:55.325
The important thing is we find him
so nobody else gets hurt.

659
00:49:55.743 --> 00:49:57.535
Nobody's gonna get hurt.

660
00:49:57.620 --> 00:50:00.038
Our daddy wouldn't
hurt a motherfuckin' fly.

661
00:50:00.122 --> 00:50:02.082
No, he goes after bigger game.

662
00:50:02.166 --> 00:50:05.418
We just got a report he put six bullets
into a cow's head.

663
00:50:05.836 --> 00:50:07.754
Poor thing's lucky to be alive.

664
00:50:10.299 --> 00:50:13.551
OK, look, let's say he does have a problem,
which he don't.

665
00:50:13.636 --> 00:50:15.303
He's been takin' pills.

666
00:50:15.388 --> 00:50:19.307
- He left his pills in the hotel room.
- That's where he left his sanity.

667
00:50:19.392 --> 00:50:22.227
I've seen it first-hand.
The guy's nuttier than squirrel turds.

668
00:50:22.311 --> 00:50:26.106
One thing I don't understand, Lieutenant.

669
00:50:26.982 --> 00:50:30.110
If my daddy's such a scary-ass
motherfucker, why'd you go by yourself?

670
00:50:31.153 --> 00:50:34.322
Who the fuck are you? Sergeant York
taking on the Germans yourself?

671
00:50:34.407 --> 00:50:37.701
Your father's a police officer.
He asked me to come alone.

672
00:50:37.785 --> 00:50:41.037
- How was I to know he's a nutcase?
- He ain't no fuckin' nutcase!

673
00:50:41.122 --> 00:50:45.458
He may have delusionary schizophrenia
with involuntary narcissistic rage,

674
00:50:45.543 --> 00:50:47.836
but he is a very gentle person.

675
00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:50.213
Motherfucker robot! Motherfucker robot!

676
00:50:58.139 --> 00:50:59.639
What's the fuss?

677
00:51:00.141 --> 00:51:01.391
Stay away from me, Hank!

678
00:51:01.475 --> 00:51:05.228
I know what you had planned.
I saw your so-called supplies.

679
00:51:08.357 --> 00:51:09.649
That.

680
00:51:10.985 --> 00:51:14.237
I wasn't gonna just ram it home, though.

681
00:51:14.321 --> 00:51:16.406
I was gonna lube it up

682
00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:19.993
and ease it in there inch by inch
like a gentleman.

683
00:51:20.077 --> 00:51:23.329
I was talking about the shovel
and the lime.

684
00:51:23.914 --> 00:51:25.623
Shovel and lime?

685
00:51:34.467 --> 00:51:37.010
Thank you.
I haven't laughed like that in a long time.

686
00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:39.429
What's so funny?

687
00:51:39.513 --> 00:51:42.140
- We're driving a hot carriage.
- So?

688
00:51:42.433 --> 00:51:44.434
That stuff belongs to the bad cop.

689
00:51:44.518 --> 00:51:48.563
You think he was gonna take
our dead bodies down to the station?

690
00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:59.157
Lrene decided they should
go back to Rhode Island,

691
00:51:59.241 --> 00:52:01.826
but Hank had an idea first.

692
00:52:01.911 --> 00:52:04.162
Are you sure about this?

693
00:52:04.246 --> 00:52:08.291
You kidding? Every oinker east of the
Mississippi will be looking for this sled.

694
00:52:08.375 --> 00:52:10.001
Safer to go mass transit.

695
00:52:10.294 --> 00:52:12.045
Ready? On nine.

696
00:52:12.671 --> 00:52:14.589
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

697
00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:32.565
Well,
they won't be tracking us in that car.

698
00:52:32.983 --> 00:52:35.151
- Thanks for the kudos.
- Sure.

699
00:52:35.236 --> 00:52:38.196
- Glad we're finally on the same page.
- Me, too.

700
00:52:40.366 --> 00:52:43.493
- You OK?
- Yes, I'm fine.

701
00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:48.373
Thought you were going over the edge.

702
00:52:48.457 --> 00:52:49.791
Thank you.

703
00:52:54.213 --> 00:52:57.048
You know, I think
you're a very special unit.

704
00:52:57.132 --> 00:52:58.508
That's sweet.

705
00:52:59.176 --> 00:53:02.053
I hope we can
get to know each other better.

706
00:53:02.137 --> 00:53:03.596
Yeah. Me too.

707
00:53:04.098 --> 00:53:05.640
Do you swallow?

708
00:53:09.645 --> 00:53:12.021
I get it. We'll go slow.

709
00:53:18.779 --> 00:53:20.238
- Hey!
- Yes?

710
00:53:21.866 --> 00:53:25.618
You didn't happen
to pick up a wallet on the dash, did you?

711
00:53:25.995 --> 00:53:27.871
You're kidding, right?

712
00:53:31.417 --> 00:53:33.710
So what's your tale? Where you from?

713
00:53:33.794 --> 00:53:35.795
Oh, all over.

714
00:53:36.213 --> 00:53:39.090
Omnipresence. I like that in a woman.

715
00:53:39.216 --> 00:53:42.635
I'm originally from Texas.
Middle-class neighborhood.

716
00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:45.054
But after school
I moved to New York 'cause...

717
00:53:45.139 --> 00:53:48.141
Let me guess.
Everybody said you were easy on the eyes,

718
00:53:48.225 --> 00:53:49.893
so you tried to become a model.

719
00:53:49.977 --> 00:53:54.856
But in the Big Apple, they treated you
like the worm, so you became an actress.

720
00:53:54.940 --> 00:53:56.816
No, but...

721
00:53:57.943 --> 00:53:59.944
But you can't get far without talent,

722
00:54:00.029 --> 00:54:04.073
and the only bright lights you saw
were the ones inside the fridge.

723
00:54:04.158 --> 00:54:08.202
So you got a boob job and went
looking for a rich man with a bum ticker

724
00:54:08.287 --> 00:54:12.081
and waved a white flag
in the face of your own self-loathing.

725
00:54:15.127 --> 00:54:17.921
- How's my aim?
- L never went to New York City.

726
00:54:18.005 --> 00:54:21.758
I went to Cornell, then I got my master's
in Turf Management at U-Mass.

727
00:54:22.009 --> 00:54:24.344
Then I became
a golf-course superintendent.

728
00:54:24.511 --> 00:54:30.767
- And these are all mine.
- L notice you left out your eating disorder.

729
00:54:30.851 --> 00:54:34.145
- L don't have an eating disorder.
- Whatever, slim.

730
00:54:39.693 --> 00:54:41.277
Hands off, Hank.

731
00:54:51.372 --> 00:54:52.455
Mom!

732
00:54:53.207 --> 00:54:56.376
That's real nice, Hank.
Way to keep a low profile.

733
00:54:57.336 --> 00:54:59.462
It's survival at this point.

734
00:55:01.674 --> 00:55:04.258
Hey, I know how to score some dough.

735
00:55:05.844 --> 00:55:07.470
- Punch me.
- What?

736
00:55:07.888 --> 00:55:10.139
- Punch me in the face.
- Why?

737
00:55:10.224 --> 00:55:12.809
I'll tell the big cheese
I got rolled in the parking lot.

738
00:55:12.893 --> 00:55:16.813
He'll hush me with some Benjamins.
They don't need that kind of ink.

739
00:55:16.897 --> 00:55:18.898
Come on, rip my head off.

740
00:55:19.149 --> 00:55:23.111
- That's really lame, Hank.
- You have a better idea? Come on!

741
00:55:23.904 --> 00:55:26.823
- It's not gonna work.
- Yes, it is, but you gotta rock me.

742
00:55:26.907 --> 00:55:30.118
Don't give me a girly
"l don't want to break a fingernail" tap.

743
00:55:30.411 --> 00:55:33.329
This guy's gotta look
at my face and just...

744
00:55:38.293 --> 00:55:41.713
Well, the kick in the chops
didn't work out as planned.

745
00:55:41.797 --> 00:55:45.008
It just left Charlie a
little more roughed up.

746
00:55:45.175 --> 00:55:46.592
How's the nose feeling?

747
00:55:46.719 --> 00:55:48.636
Listen to it.

748
00:55:50.472 --> 00:55:54.350
- L'm really sorry, Charlie.
- L'll get over it.

749
00:55:55.602 --> 00:55:59.480
I mean, you should be furious.
I just drop-kicked you right in the face.

750
00:55:59.565 --> 00:56:01.190
Hey, it happens.

751
00:56:04.570 --> 00:56:07.780
You got a great way
of looking at life, Charlie. You know that?

752
00:56:08.032 --> 00:56:09.365
That's a gift.

753
00:56:09.450 --> 00:56:11.868
Yeah, I don't know
if my shrinks would agree.

754
00:56:11.952 --> 00:56:13.536
They think that's my problem.

755
00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:14.829
What?

756
00:56:16.123 --> 00:56:21.627
That I purposely distort my perceptions
to make my reality more palatable.

757
00:56:22.838 --> 00:56:24.922
Like you only hear what you wanna hear?

758
00:56:25.883 --> 00:56:29.302
Thanks. I like to keep it short,
especially in the summer.

759
00:56:32.973 --> 00:56:37.727
How come I couldn't have ended up with
an easy-going guy like you, Charlie? Huh?

760
00:56:38.353 --> 00:56:43.107
Sometimes I think there's something
about my look that just attracts assholes.

761
00:56:43.275 --> 00:56:44.650
That's crazy.

762
00:56:44.735 --> 00:56:47.153
You're a very special girl, lrene.
Look at you.

763
00:56:47.237 --> 00:56:48.946
You're just so down-to-earth.

764
00:56:49.031 --> 00:56:52.700
I mean, look at your hair.
It's like you don't give a damn.

765
00:56:52.785 --> 00:56:57.663
And you let your skin hang out, blemishes
an' all. You're not afraid of your flaws.

766
00:56:57.748 --> 00:57:01.542
Your face is all pursed up
like you just sucked on a lemon,

767
00:57:01.627 --> 00:57:03.377
but you pull it off!

768
00:57:12.679 --> 00:57:15.014
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

769
00:57:15.974 --> 00:57:18.768
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah.

770
00:57:22.689 --> 00:57:24.065
Come on!

771
00:57:25.442 --> 00:57:28.319
- L don't know if I can!
- Yes, you can!

772
00:57:28.570 --> 00:57:30.905
Humans only use 1 0% of their potential!

773
00:57:31.281 --> 00:57:33.866
You gotta reach down
for that little extra something!

774
00:57:38.413 --> 00:57:40.331
There you go!

775
00:57:40.415 --> 00:57:42.542
Now you're gettin' it!

776
00:57:42.626 --> 00:57:44.252
I believe in you!

777
00:57:45.546 --> 00:57:48.089
Don't you give up on me now!

778
00:57:53.679 --> 00:57:56.556
Easier than I thought! Come on!

779
00:57:57.391 --> 00:58:00.184
Go, Charlie. Go! You can do it!

780
00:58:00.269 --> 00:58:01.894
Come on, Charlie!

781
00:58:02.229 --> 00:58:04.814
Use more of your potential!

782
00:58:11.989 --> 00:58:13.990
Come on, Charlie! Go!

783
00:58:14.241 --> 00:58:15.783
Jump off!

784
00:58:16.034 --> 00:58:18.077
- What?
- Jump off!

785
00:58:19.079 --> 00:58:20.413
What?

786
00:58:20.956 --> 00:58:23.416
Jump off the train!

787
00:58:32.217 --> 00:58:33.467
Lrene?

788
00:58:35.179 --> 00:58:37.430
Come on. Stop fooling around.

789
00:58:38.807 --> 00:58:41.100
I started thinking about it. Bad idea.

790
00:58:41.768 --> 00:58:44.562
Trains are the first place they'll look.

791
00:58:45.439 --> 00:58:46.689
Oh, come on.

792
00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:51.986
We checked all the gas and food stops
along the interstate. No sign of 'em.

793
00:58:52.070 --> 00:58:54.697
Interstate! Is your old lady happy?

794
00:58:56.158 --> 00:58:57.533
My old lady?

795
00:58:57.618 --> 00:59:00.536
Cos if your fuckin' is
like your police work,

796
00:59:00.621 --> 00:59:03.497
you couldn't hit the G spot
on a 1 2lb pussy.

797
00:59:03.582 --> 00:59:05.124
Watch yourself.

798
00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:10.713
- What are you gettin' at?
- Look, Daddy ain't gonna take no road

799
00:59:10.797 --> 00:59:13.424
where y'all blind-ass cops is lookin'.

800
00:59:13.634 --> 00:59:15.843
And, motherfucker, he don't eat fast food.

801
00:59:19.014 --> 00:59:21.557
OK, I have three dollars.
How much do you have?

802
00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:24.727
- Six bucks.
- Let me go up and order, so we can go.

803
00:59:24.811 --> 00:59:28.189
OK. I'll have a chicken breast sandwich.
No skin, dry toast.

804
00:59:31.985 --> 00:59:36.572
You make me dizzy
running circles in my head

805
00:59:36.949 --> 00:59:43.496
One of these days I'll chase you down

806
00:59:43.664 --> 00:59:46.249
Well, look who's going crazy now

807
00:59:46.333 --> 00:59:48.834
We're face to face, my friend

808
00:59:49.336 --> 00:59:52.171
Better get out

809
00:59:52.256 --> 00:59:54.840
Better get out!

810
00:59:54.925 --> 00:59:59.303
- What are you starin' at, fucker?
- You know you make me break out...

811
00:59:59.554 --> 01:00:02.014
Wanna start me up?
Just pull the cord, pal.

812
01:00:02.307 --> 01:00:05.268
I'm due for a seismic event.
You're dancin' on the fault line.

813
01:00:05.644 --> 01:00:10.606
- Hey, what is your problem, pal?
- L got no beef with you. Just the kid.

814
01:00:10.691 --> 01:00:13.276
- Hey, stop it!
- He started it.

815
01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:16.696
I'm so sorry. I apologize.
He suffers from this thing.

816
01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:18.197
I'm standing right here, four-eyes.

817
01:00:19.408 --> 01:00:22.660
Oh, poor baby. Has to let his daddy
fight his battles for him, huh?

818
01:00:23.745 --> 01:00:25.204
He's an ass.

819
01:00:32.379 --> 01:00:33.587
Pussy.

820
01:00:38.969 --> 01:00:41.012
How's it hangin', fellas?

821
01:00:41.179 --> 01:00:42.763
Hank, I presume.

822
01:00:45.559 --> 01:00:48.269
- D'you miss me?
- Why don't you get Charlie back?

823
01:00:48.353 --> 01:00:50.604
Things were finally becoming civilized.

824
01:00:50.897 --> 01:00:54.692
Pocahontas, you gotta put your ear
to the ground to hear the buffalo.

825
01:00:54.776 --> 01:00:56.902
I don't know what that means, OK?

826
01:00:57.112 --> 01:01:02.033
It means either he makes up a battle plan,
or Hank'll take over Fort Charlie for good.

827
01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:06.412
Did you just refer to yourself
in the fourth person?

828
01:01:06.663 --> 01:01:09.957
Holy Jesus in heaven! It's a giant Q-Tip.

829
01:01:10.042 --> 01:01:11.083
Hank!

830
01:01:11.168 --> 01:01:14.712
What? I'm jokin'.
Bringin' a little sunshine into his life.

831
01:01:14.796 --> 01:01:16.881
Careful, you'll peel.

832
01:01:17.257 --> 01:01:21.010
- Do you need to see a menu?
- No, thank you. We've ordered.

833
01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:28.768
That's it.

834
01:01:28.935 --> 01:01:31.395
Hold on, cheese tits.

835
01:01:31.563 --> 01:01:34.315
- Did I miss something?
- Don't give me that shit!

836
01:01:34.399 --> 01:01:37.026
What you just did to that kid was terrible.

837
01:01:37.110 --> 01:01:39.695
Didn't you see the look on his face?

838
01:01:42.449 --> 01:01:44.742
Looked a little pale, that's all.

839
01:01:44.826 --> 01:01:47.536
He was hurt and offended.

840
01:01:47.704 --> 01:01:50.247
Well, I disagree, but why speculate?

841
01:01:50.874 --> 01:01:53.793
- Hey, Milky! ¡Vámonos!
- Hey, no!

842
01:01:53.877 --> 01:01:57.671
Come on, Br'er Rabbit. Hop down
the bunny trail. Epa, epa, ándale.

843
01:01:59.257 --> 01:02:03.969
Listen, were you offended in any way
by our social interaction here?

844
01:02:04.805 --> 01:02:06.597
Yeah, actually I was.

845
01:02:09.226 --> 01:02:11.102
What was it? The Q-Tip thing?

846
01:02:11.186 --> 01:02:15.231
Actually I was pretty much offended
by everything you said, sir.

847
01:02:22.531 --> 01:02:23.739
Sorry.

848
01:02:27.661 --> 01:02:29.245
I'm truly sorry.

849
01:02:50.934 --> 01:02:52.143
You OK?

850
01:02:55.564 --> 01:02:57.648
You don't know what it was like.

851
01:02:57.774 --> 01:03:01.610
Spending all those years
trapped behind a wall of politeness.

852
01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:03.737
Bound and gagged...

853
01:03:04.364 --> 01:03:08.200
In a dark and silent world
where nothing grows but the anger.

854
01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:14.206
All because some demon he married
laced up her boots

855
01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:15.875
and did a Nancy Sinatra on him.

856
01:03:16.751 --> 01:03:19.003
Charlie had a wife?

857
01:03:20.088 --> 01:03:21.630
And then some.

858
01:03:22.507 --> 01:03:25.718
I was a big piece
of the personality pie back then.

859
01:03:25.802 --> 01:03:28.721
But when she left him,
Charlie went numb...

860
01:03:28.930 --> 01:03:30.681
And I went AWOL.

861
01:03:31.558 --> 01:03:32.808
Well,

862
01:03:34.644 --> 01:03:37.730
if you were
such a big part of the personality,

863
01:03:38.690 --> 01:03:40.733
then she left you too.

864
01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:50.618
It's true.

865
01:03:54.414 --> 01:03:56.123
She left us.

866
01:03:58.793 --> 01:04:00.252
I loved her.

867
01:04:03.089 --> 01:04:04.965
Why'd she do this?

868
01:04:06.593 --> 01:04:12.473
I'm not a bad person.

869
01:04:13.642 --> 01:04:15.726
No, you're not a bad guy.

870
01:04:16.228 --> 01:04:17.770
No, you're not.

871
01:04:18.438 --> 01:04:19.939
D'you hear me?

872
01:04:24.277 --> 01:04:26.111
You're a good person.

873
01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:32.284
You really think so?

874
01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:35.746
Yeah, I'm starting to.

875
01:04:46.299 --> 01:04:48.384
You know what I'm gonna do?

876
01:04:49.135 --> 01:04:51.470
I'm gonna make it up to Charlie.

877
01:04:51.972 --> 01:04:56.141
And I'm gonna make it up
to that sweet little circus geek in there.

878
01:04:59.187 --> 01:05:00.312
Hank?

879
01:05:02.315 --> 01:05:03.399
Agent Boshane!

880
01:05:03.483 --> 01:05:07.027
They were spotted leaving a health-food
restaurant 1 00 miles from here.

881
01:05:07.112 --> 01:05:09.154
- 1 5 minutes, tops.
- Got it.

882
01:05:16.496 --> 01:05:18.539
They got 1 50 cordoned off?

883
01:05:20.208 --> 01:05:21.584
Let's fly!

884
01:05:41.354 --> 01:05:44.189
Can you please tell him to stop this?

885
01:05:44.691 --> 01:05:46.525
Charlie, is that you?

886
01:05:50.822 --> 01:05:52.281
Hey, my nose.

887
01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:55.367
My nose is fixed.

888
01:05:58.121 --> 01:06:01.498
- Lsn't that great?
- How'd that happen?

889
01:06:01.833 --> 01:06:06.295
Well, Hank wanted
to do something nice for you,

890
01:06:06.379 --> 01:06:10.549
so he insisted that we
go to a plastic surgeon.

891
01:06:11.134 --> 01:06:14.345
What? Did you say plastic surgeon?

892
01:06:15.221 --> 01:06:16.639
Oh, my God.

893
01:06:17.557 --> 01:06:19.058
What is this?

894
01:06:19.142 --> 01:06:21.435
What d'you... What is this?

895
01:06:22.228 --> 01:06:26.440
Hank thought that you kinda
had a weak chin, so...

896
01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:28.942
What?

897
01:06:30.195 --> 01:06:33.072
I like my chin...

898
01:06:33.865 --> 01:06:35.366
I like my chin.

899
01:06:35.450 --> 01:06:38.118
It's my chin! It's my chin! Mine!

900
01:06:38.411 --> 01:06:39.870
How'd you pay for it?

901
01:06:39.954 --> 01:06:41.914
I loaned him the money.

902
01:06:42.499 --> 01:06:44.416
Who the hell are you?

903
01:06:45.335 --> 01:06:46.669
It's me.

904
01:06:47.295 --> 01:06:48.504
Milky.

905
01:06:53.635 --> 01:06:56.762
Who the hell is Milky
and what is he doing here?

906
01:06:58.932 --> 01:07:02.851
Lrene has a lot of people who would like
to see her in an unmarked grave.

907
01:07:02.936 --> 01:07:05.604
I don't think it's safe
for you to hang around with us.

908
01:07:05.689 --> 01:07:09.608
Why not?
You, lrene and Hank are my only friends.

909
01:07:10.694 --> 01:07:13.487
What about your family?
Won't they miss you?

910
01:07:13.571 --> 01:07:15.280
My family's all...

911
01:07:16.991 --> 01:07:18.450
They're gone.

912
01:07:19.327 --> 01:07:20.619
Oh, jeez.

913
01:07:29.295 --> 01:07:32.965
Well, we can't call you Milky anymore.
What's your real name?

914
01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:35.884
Casper. But my friends call me Whitey.

915
01:07:38.012 --> 01:07:39.138
OK.

916
01:07:43.685 --> 01:07:48.480
I can't find the time to tell you

917
01:07:53.445 --> 01:07:58.157
I can't find the time to tell you...

918
01:07:59.325 --> 01:08:00.492
Whoa!

919
01:08:00.744 --> 01:08:03.245
So many things to say

920
01:08:03.329 --> 01:08:09.626
I could fit it in a book, fit it in a book
of a thousand pages, yeah

921
01:08:10.628 --> 01:08:13.088
So many people say

922
01:08:13.173 --> 01:08:18.427
That I couldn't tell a lie,
couldn't tell a lie in a thousand ages

923
01:08:18.511 --> 01:08:22.181
- Here you go. I got your car all filled up.
- Thank you, Joseph.

924
01:08:24.726 --> 01:08:27.561
Oh, yeah.

925
01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:32.941
Get your cock out of my Chrysler,
you son of a bitch!

926
01:08:34.611 --> 01:08:39.156
You son of a...
I'm gonna kill you! I'm gonna get you!

927
01:08:46.039 --> 01:08:50.667
I can't find the time to tell you

928
01:08:52.879 --> 01:08:55.839
I look at your pretty face

929
01:08:55.924 --> 01:08:58.717
And I fall in love with you
Fall in love with you

930
01:08:58.802 --> 01:09:02.971
Every time I see you there

931
01:09:05.725 --> 01:09:08.393
They are flowing to the ground
Flowing to the ground

932
01:09:08.478 --> 01:09:11.271
In a mist around you

933
01:09:12.732 --> 01:09:20.732
Baby, you're wrong

934
01:09:21.241 --> 01:09:22.741
What's that on your shirt?

935
01:09:25.495 --> 01:09:27.120
I'm sorry.

936
01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:30.749
That was good.

937
01:09:31.501 --> 01:09:34.044
Charlie, what the hell is that?

938
01:09:34.504 --> 01:09:38.090
- Oh, yeah, I'm gonna fall for that.
- No, Charlie.

939
01:09:38.967 --> 01:09:40.217
Not me.

940
01:09:40.927 --> 01:09:42.594
Nice try though.

941
01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:44.930
How dumb do I look?

942
01:09:53.606 --> 01:09:57.693
I can't find the time to tell you

943
01:09:57.944 --> 01:10:02.698
I can't find the time to tell you...

944
01:10:05.451 --> 01:10:08.203
Hey, they only had two rooms: 1 9 and 20.

945
01:10:08.288 --> 01:10:10.414
So you guys will have to bunk up.

946
01:10:13.042 --> 01:10:17.880
I can't find the time to tell you

947
01:10:23.428 --> 01:10:24.887
So, Whitey...

948
01:10:26.723 --> 01:10:28.765
What happened to your family?

949
01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:30.392
I killed them.

950
01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:33.979
Come again?

951
01:10:34.188 --> 01:10:38.567
When I was 1 5, I hacked them up
with a hammer while they were sleeping.

952
01:10:38.776 --> 01:10:42.112
Ma, Dad, my bro and my sis.

953
01:10:45.116 --> 01:10:47.034
She was awake, my sis.

954
01:10:49.287 --> 01:10:50.829
Which I regret.

955
01:10:52.832 --> 01:10:54.750
Yeah, well...

956
01:10:56.002 --> 01:10:59.379
We all have family stuff.

957
01:11:00.882 --> 01:11:04.676
That's what makes the holidays so hard.

958
01:11:04.761 --> 01:11:08.055
I just got released last month
on my 21st birthday.

959
01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:14.645
To tell you the truth, I really wasn't
ready to leave, but they said I had to.

960
01:11:17.190 --> 01:11:18.941
That's a fucked-up law, huh?

961
01:11:21.235 --> 01:11:25.030
Well, I guess they need the extra room
for the real...

962
01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:27.032
Psychos.

963
01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:29.868
I'm gonna go and try to make out
with whatsherface.

964
01:11:30.036 --> 01:11:31.870
- Go for it.
- All right!

965
01:11:32.455 --> 01:11:33.789
- What?
- Yeah.

966
01:11:33.873 --> 01:11:39.628
He just told me that he brutally murdered
his entire family in their sleep!

967
01:11:39.921 --> 01:11:43.548
- Oh, my God!
- He was a juvenile. They just let him out.

968
01:11:45.385 --> 01:11:50.430
So, I was gonna ask if I could...

969
01:11:50.515 --> 01:11:51.890
Stay here.

970
01:11:53.059 --> 01:11:55.185
But I can sleep in the car.

971
01:12:00.441 --> 01:12:03.485
That's me and my whippersnappers.
I'm Dorothy.

972
01:12:04.654 --> 01:12:06.279
Look at you!

973
01:12:08.658 --> 01:12:11.868
When did you take this? At Halloween?

974
01:12:11.953 --> 01:12:14.413
No. Just messing around the house.

975
01:12:19.043 --> 01:12:21.920
You seem like a really good dad, Charlie.

976
01:12:25.425 --> 01:12:26.800
I try to be.

977
01:12:28.594 --> 01:12:31.555
They're incredible kids. Oh, God.

978
01:12:32.181 --> 01:12:36.184
So happy and funny.
They never give me any grief.

979
01:12:37.645 --> 01:12:41.648
- They're the top three students out of 21 1.
- Golly!

980
01:12:41.733 --> 01:12:45.652
- L don't know where they get it from.
- That's just good genes.

981
01:12:49.157 --> 01:12:54.036
You know, I don't think l... No, I don't
think I carry even one picture anymore.

982
01:12:54.829 --> 01:12:57.539
- Why not?
- L don't know.

983
01:12:57.623 --> 01:13:02.461
I used to when I was younger.
Pictures of friends and stuff like that.

984
01:13:02.962 --> 01:13:06.006
I guess they just got old and fell apart.

985
01:13:08.217 --> 01:13:10.677
Kind of like the friendships.

986
01:13:12.638 --> 01:13:14.556
That's too bad.

987
01:13:20.146 --> 01:13:24.357
- Tell you what. Why not keep that one?
- No, Charlie. That's yours.

988
01:13:24.442 --> 01:13:28.236
Are you kidding? I have tons of them
at home. No, I got a bunch. Come on.

989
01:13:28.321 --> 01:13:29.654
- You do?
- Yeah.

990
01:13:31.157 --> 01:13:32.282
OK.

991
01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:38.497
Thanks.

992
01:13:52.845 --> 01:13:54.137
I'm dry.

993
01:13:56.390 --> 01:14:00.393
You know, I'm gonna go get a soda.

994
01:14:01.354 --> 01:14:04.815
- You want a soda?
- Sure. OK.

995
01:14:26.379 --> 01:14:29.756
I caught that, bozo.
Not once but twice it burned ya.

996
01:14:34.053 --> 01:14:36.304
Give it another kick.

997
01:14:43.896 --> 01:14:46.439
- L think I just had an epiphany!
- What?

998
01:14:47.233 --> 01:14:50.277
That I might be able to control
this problem of mine.

999
01:14:50.444 --> 01:14:52.028
How'd you learn that?

1000
01:14:52.864 --> 01:14:56.575
First the Coke machine robbed me.
And I'm fine with that.

1001
01:14:56.742 --> 01:14:59.661
But then some guy came up
and laughed in my face.

1002
01:14:59.745 --> 01:15:02.664
- Oh, no.
- No, no, but that's just it!

1003
01:15:02.748 --> 01:15:06.668
See? Just when I was starting to feel
those old familiar feelings,

1004
01:15:06.752 --> 01:15:11.381
I just took a deep breath, counted
backwards from 1 0 and I said to the guy

1005
01:15:11.465 --> 01:15:15.010
"Excuse me, sir, but your laughter
is not helping me right now."

1006
01:15:15.094 --> 01:15:18.180
And he said
"l'm sorry. I didn't mean to make fun."

1007
01:15:18.306 --> 01:15:21.266
That was it! I helped him with his bags.

1008
01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:23.101
- Really?
- Yes.

1009
01:15:23.186 --> 01:15:25.520
Well, that's great!

1010
01:15:25.605 --> 01:15:27.606
And you got the Cokes.

1011
01:15:27.690 --> 01:15:30.567
Just a little rap on the side
of the machine and presto!

1012
01:15:31.652 --> 01:15:33.778
Maybe that's it though, you know?

1013
01:15:35.948 --> 01:15:40.994
- Look what I found in my bag.
- Oh, no! Oh, boy.

1014
01:15:41.078 --> 01:15:43.205
What do you think? Do you?

1015
01:15:43.289 --> 01:15:47.542
Under the right circumstances,
sure, I could tip a few.

1016
01:15:48.753 --> 01:15:51.338
And these are the right circumstances.

1017
01:15:52.632 --> 01:15:53.757
There you go.

1018
01:15:54.217 --> 01:15:57.427
- Celebrate good times, come on.
- Oh, well.

1019
01:15:57.511 --> 01:15:59.512
Whoa, that must be mine!

1020
01:16:52.525 --> 01:16:54.109
Jesus! Oh, God.

1021
01:16:54.819 --> 01:16:56.736
Oh, my God!

1022
01:17:13.254 --> 01:17:14.546
Lrene?

1023
01:17:17.591 --> 01:17:20.385
Why am I peeing
like I was up all night having sex?

1024
01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:24.431
Well, seems old Hank
had pulled a fast one.

1025
01:17:24.515 --> 01:17:29.769
And if that wasn't bad enough, there was
more trouble right around the corner.

1026
01:17:33.149 --> 01:17:35.650
I want everybody to stay put
and wait for my order.

1027
01:17:36.152 --> 01:17:40.238
- You mean you couldn't tell the difference?
- Are you serious?

1028
01:17:41.866 --> 01:17:45.201
- Who the hell could?
- A sober person for one.

1029
01:17:46.078 --> 01:17:48.163
So we had some drinks.

1030
01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:58.256
Well, look who joined the party.

1031
01:18:00.634 --> 01:18:04.429
Did you have fun?
"Ooh, yes, I did! Ooh, yes I did!"

1032
01:18:05.181 --> 01:18:07.932
So old Hanky-Panky
wasn't enough for you, huh?

1033
01:18:09.310 --> 01:18:11.019
It wasn't for me.

1034
01:18:16.025 --> 01:18:18.485
- Are you sure this is the woman?
- Absolutely.

1035
01:18:18.611 --> 01:18:23.198
When my boyfriend Scooter brought in
the paper, I recognized her right away.

1036
01:18:25.076 --> 01:18:26.951
Thanks a lot. Scooter.

1037
01:18:35.127 --> 01:18:38.004
- Here they come.
- Look, Starsky and Hutch, this is the plan.

1038
01:18:38.089 --> 01:18:41.091
Let us talk to our dad
so this ain't gotta be no big thing.

1039
01:18:41.175 --> 01:18:43.343
Thanks, but this is
the end of the line for you.

1040
01:18:43.427 --> 01:18:46.221
Officer Stubie'll drive you to the chopper.

1041
01:18:46.305 --> 01:18:49.182
What? You brung us all the way down
for us to leave now?

1042
01:18:49.266 --> 01:18:53.728
- That don't make no motherfuckin' sense!
- You've done all you can do.

1043
01:18:53.813 --> 01:18:55.897
This is a police matter from now on.

1044
01:18:55.981 --> 01:18:58.358
Wait. It may be a police matter to you,

1045
01:18:58.442 --> 01:19:01.194
but the police don't matter shit to me
when it's my daddy in there!

1046
01:19:01.946 --> 01:19:05.907
I said you're gettin' the hell outta here.
That's the end of it.

1047
01:19:07.827 --> 01:19:11.746
Guys, look, I'm sorry. I hate to admit it,
but this time he's right.

1048
01:19:11.831 --> 01:19:15.500
- You can't be here. It's a liability.
- He's the fuckin' liability!

1049
01:19:15.584 --> 01:19:19.421
Don't worry. This is my investigation.
I promise there will be no bloodshed.

1050
01:19:19.505 --> 01:19:20.922
I promise!

1051
01:19:22.591 --> 01:19:24.551
Come on, guys. Let's go.

1052
01:19:29.181 --> 01:19:31.015
You OK, Charlie?

1053
01:19:31.934 --> 01:19:33.852
Yeah. I'm just...

1054
01:19:34.895 --> 01:19:35.979
Freshening up!

1055
01:19:40.985 --> 01:19:43.111
How do you wanna handle it?

1056
01:19:45.489 --> 01:19:48.616
I say we storm the place
and start shooting.

1057
01:19:48.701 --> 01:19:52.120
- What if he's unarmed?
- Plant a gun on him afterwards.

1058
01:19:57.710 --> 01:19:59.836
Don't fuck it up this time.

1059
01:20:21.859 --> 01:20:23.776
Agent Boshane!

1060
01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:28.239
It's Stubie.
He's got Baileygates and the girl.

1061
01:20:28.574 --> 01:20:29.741
What?

1062
01:20:34.747 --> 01:20:36.664
This is Boshane. What's going on?

1063
01:20:36.749 --> 01:20:40.335
I caught 'em out on 1 34 in a stolen
vehicle. Baileygates and the girl.

1064
01:20:40.419 --> 01:20:43.755
Officer Stubie,
I don't want you to attempt to move them.

1065
01:20:43.839 --> 01:20:47.675
- Don't move them! We'll be right there.
- Get in your cars. Come on!

1066
01:20:49.470 --> 01:20:53.806
We sure is sorry, Officer, but our
daddy told us to trust our instinct,

1067
01:20:53.891 --> 01:20:57.268
and our instinct says
somethin' don't smell right. Let's roll.

1068
01:20:57.353 --> 01:20:59.270
You guys are making a big mistake!

1069
01:21:00.189 --> 01:21:01.750
'Cause I promise you,
when I find your old man,

1070
01:21:01.774 --> 01:21:04.192
I'm personally gonna fuck him up!

1071
01:21:08.489 --> 01:21:11.324
Why'd you go an' say
somethin' like that for, huh?

1072
01:21:11.408 --> 01:21:12.784
Lee Harvey.

1073
01:21:13.118 --> 01:21:15.662
- What's the diameter of a chicken egg?
- 4.08cm.

1074
01:21:15.746 --> 01:21:19.082
- No, what's that in inches?
- 1.61. What the fuck you gettin' at?

1075
01:21:19.166 --> 01:21:22.418
I got 1 0 bucks say
I can squeeze a chicken egg up his ass.

1076
01:21:22.503 --> 01:21:25.713
You can't put no chicken egg up his ass.
He's a tightass!

1077
01:21:25.798 --> 01:21:28.049
- No, it can be done.
- Yo, I'll take that bet.

1078
01:21:28.133 --> 01:21:30.051
- Right on.
- Pull yo' ass out!

1079
01:21:38.936 --> 01:21:40.061
I'll tell you one thing.

1080
01:21:40.145 --> 01:21:42.939
If I didn't have bad luck,
I'd have no luck at all.

1081
01:21:43.023 --> 01:21:44.941
What are we gonna do about Whitey?

1082
01:21:45.025 --> 01:21:47.402
Take a guess. We're going on without him.

1083
01:21:47.486 --> 01:21:48.820
Moody.

1084
01:21:49.488 --> 01:21:51.656
Well, I didn't have
the fun you had last night.

1085
01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:54.867
Just the hangover
and the swollen prostate.

1086
01:21:54.952 --> 01:21:59.414
- D'you have any cash left?
- Yes. $60, but it's Whitey's.

1087
01:21:59.498 --> 01:22:04.085
Yeah, well, bad things happen to people
who kill their family with a hammer.

1088
01:22:09.508 --> 01:22:12.135
- L'm payin' under protest.
- It was close enough.

1089
01:22:12.219 --> 01:22:14.178
Yeah, whatever.

1090
01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:17.432
Shit.

1091
01:22:17.516 --> 01:22:20.518
Give me the scanner, so we can find out
what the fuck's goin' on!

1092
01:22:20.603 --> 01:22:22.979
Anybody know how to fly this thing?

1093
01:22:23.188 --> 01:22:26.441
Motherfucker, it's just lift
versus drag and rotation!

1094
01:22:26.525 --> 01:22:30.278
- Yeah, get your head out your ass!
- It ain't that. This manual's in German.

1095
01:22:30.362 --> 01:22:35.283
- Motherfucker, you speak German!
- L can speak it. I didn't say I could read it!

1096
01:22:35.367 --> 01:22:37.702
You's a motherfuckin' disgrace!

1097
01:22:47.046 --> 01:22:49.130
Then get this motherfucker off the ground!

1098
01:22:49.214 --> 01:22:51.841
All right! Oh, shit!

1099
01:23:09.818 --> 01:23:11.069
Jesus!

1100
01:23:14.365 --> 01:23:18.201
Would somebody get this goddamn
chicken out of my ass, please?

1101
01:23:31.632 --> 01:23:36.427
Everybody, stay back. We'll do this alone.
I'll take 1 9, you take 20. Stay back!

1102
01:23:44.937 --> 01:23:46.854
Goddamn it!

1103
01:23:49.441 --> 01:23:52.568
Sons of bitches, I'll show 'em.
Sons of bitches.

1104
01:23:54.321 --> 01:23:57.865
- L need a gun and lots of ammo.
- Sorry.

1105
01:23:57.950 --> 01:24:00.159
72-hour wait. Federal law.

1106
01:24:00.244 --> 01:24:04.122
- How far am I from Rhode Island?
- Four or five hours.

1107
01:24:04.498 --> 01:24:07.875
Got a map of New England,
if you want. $1.95.

1108
01:24:09.586 --> 01:24:12.714
- Here's a five. Keep the change.
- Thanks.

1109
01:24:23.976 --> 01:24:26.310
- Hello.
- Finneran, it's Charlie.

1110
01:24:26.395 --> 01:24:29.605
Charlie, you are in deep shit.
Where the hell are you?

1111
01:24:29.690 --> 01:24:32.066
Listen, you gotta get a message
to the colonel.

1112
01:24:32.317 --> 01:24:35.570
But no one outside the department
can know about this, OK?

1113
01:24:35.654 --> 01:24:37.488
'Cause this is deep.

1114
01:24:37.656 --> 01:24:41.159
4.30, South County train station.
Bring plenty of backup. You got it.

1115
01:24:41.785 --> 01:24:44.746
Don't worry. Nobody outside
the department will hear about this.

1116
01:24:44.830 --> 01:24:46.748
Watch yourself, buddy.

1117
01:24:49.585 --> 01:24:51.294
4.30, huh?

1118
01:24:51.378 --> 01:24:54.839
Thanks for notifying us, Officer.
No, you've been a really big help.

1119
01:24:55.674 --> 01:24:57.800
- You stay close.
- Yes, sir.

1120
01:24:59.094 --> 01:25:00.470
Excuse me.

1121
01:25:01.805 --> 01:25:05.141
- Where's Dickie?
- He's waiting for us in Boston.

1122
01:25:05.434 --> 01:25:08.352
I think it's time
our rich boy got his hands dirty.

1123
01:25:11.064 --> 01:25:12.315
Tell me.

1124
01:25:12.691 --> 01:25:14.025
How was...

1125
01:25:14.568 --> 01:25:16.068
Mr. Wonderful?

1126
01:25:16.653 --> 01:25:20.990
This is getting really ridiculous, Charlie,
so just let it go.

1127
01:25:22.034 --> 01:25:25.536
I turn my back for one minute
and you stick it up my ass! Literally!

1128
01:25:25.621 --> 01:25:28.873
For your information,
you stuck it in your own ass!

1129
01:25:30.709 --> 01:25:35.546
Don't turn this around on me, OK? You're
the one who can't keep your legs closed.

1130
01:25:44.306 --> 01:25:48.267
- Why are you doing this?
- Because I l... ike you.

1131
01:25:53.941 --> 01:25:55.066
What?

1132
01:25:58.445 --> 01:26:06.445
I like you.

1133
01:26:14.044 --> 01:26:16.254
Well, you shouldn't, Charlie.

1134
01:26:17.297 --> 01:26:19.006
I'm just a ditz.

1135
01:26:20.717 --> 01:26:24.220
A ditz? What are you talking about?
You're 27 years old.

1136
01:26:24.304 --> 01:26:27.306
You're the superintendent
of a major golf resort.

1137
01:26:28.267 --> 01:26:33.271
Yeah, well, I kind of fudged my résumé
a little bit to get that job.

1138
01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:40.111
Look, I don't know the first thing about
running a golf course, Charlie. I'm a model.

1139
01:26:42.447 --> 01:26:44.866
I moved to New York,
but none of it worked out,

1140
01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:47.660
so then I tried to be an actress and...

1141
01:26:48.662 --> 01:26:52.331
I got this eating disorder
where I gained, like, 20lb.

1142
01:26:52.624 --> 01:26:54.500
- That's not that bad.
- Ln a week.

1143
01:26:56.461 --> 01:26:59.130
So I kind of lost my self-respect.

1144
01:27:00.215 --> 01:27:03.551
Before you know it, I had 70-year-old guys
trying to support me

1145
01:27:03.635 --> 01:27:06.554
and I really didn't like
who I was becoming.

1146
01:27:10.058 --> 01:27:13.603
God, I have made so many mistakes.

1147
01:27:15.647 --> 01:27:16.856
Lrene...

1148
01:27:19.443 --> 01:27:23.112
You didn't know what Dickie was up to.
Did you?

1149
01:27:24.489 --> 01:27:27.158
I may be a ditz, but I'm not a crook.

1150
01:27:39.922 --> 01:27:43.132
When we met, light was set

1151
01:27:43.216 --> 01:27:44.926
Thoughts free flow

1152
01:27:45.010 --> 01:27:48.304
You said you've got something

1153
01:27:49.097 --> 01:27:51.182
Deep inside of you

1154
01:27:51.850 --> 01:27:54.769
A wind-chime voice sounds

1155
01:27:54.853 --> 01:27:58.022
Sway of your hips 'round rings true

1156
01:27:58.190 --> 01:27:59.774
My ass is really sore.

1157
01:28:00.275 --> 01:28:02.693
It goes deep inside of you

1158
01:28:12.871 --> 01:28:13.955
Wow!

1159
01:28:16.583 --> 01:28:19.085
I never get tired of hearing that.

1160
01:28:35.602 --> 01:28:36.686
Hey.

1161
01:28:37.854 --> 01:28:41.065
I'm lookin' for my friends.
A pretty blonde and a guy with a buzz cut.

1162
01:28:41.233 --> 01:28:43.234
- Cabin E.
- Thanks a lot.

1163
01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:56.956
Don't make a sound.

1164
01:28:57.082 --> 01:29:00.292
I don't know anything,
and that's what I told the police.

1165
01:29:00.377 --> 01:29:04.714
Shut up, lrene! You just listen to me.
Maybe we can work something out.

1166
01:29:08.093 --> 01:29:11.429
Time to face the music, Mozart.
And one, and two, and...

1167
01:29:32.784 --> 01:29:35.494
Warden, I want my own cell.

1168
01:29:36.371 --> 01:29:38.456
Great. You again.

1169
01:29:40.959 --> 01:29:45.713
- What tree did this sap ooze out of?
- It's Dickie! He got me into all this crap!

1170
01:29:45.797 --> 01:29:47.381
- Oh, your golf buddy.
- Yeah.

1171
01:29:47.758 --> 01:29:50.259
- L hope it's OK if I play through.
- Hank!

1172
01:29:50.343 --> 01:29:53.137
- OK, turn around. I'll play the back nine.
- Stop it!

1173
01:29:53.221 --> 01:29:56.182
Come on. He couldn't have
chewed up the greens that badly.

1174
01:29:56.266 --> 01:29:57.558
Get away from me!

1175
01:29:57.642 --> 01:30:02.354
He hasn't played the course in a long time.
It was Charlie who was putting.

1176
01:30:03.106 --> 01:30:04.523
- Charlie?
- Yeah.

1177
01:30:04.608 --> 01:30:07.943
He might not be long on the tee,
but he's got a good up-and-down game.

1178
01:30:08.028 --> 01:30:10.738
What's that suppo...
Can we speak English?

1179
01:30:10.822 --> 01:30:15.117
I never wanted to sleep with you, Hank!
OK? You tricked me!

1180
01:30:15.202 --> 01:30:19.580
That's right, I did trick you. It was
deceitful, disgusting and despicable.

1181
01:30:19.664 --> 01:30:22.500
But just this once,
try to look at it from my side.

1182
01:30:22.584 --> 01:30:24.043
I was horny.

1183
01:30:24.461 --> 01:30:26.003
Oh, God!

1184
01:30:26.088 --> 01:30:28.089
You are such an asshole!

1185
01:30:28.173 --> 01:30:30.716
Come on.
Don't be mad, my little pussyfart.

1186
01:30:34.763 --> 01:30:36.889
I warned you about that, buddy!

1187
01:30:37.349 --> 01:30:39.308
Warned me about what?

1188
01:30:41.228 --> 01:30:43.437
Charlie?

1189
01:30:44.481 --> 01:30:47.191
Providence, Rhode Island.
Ten-minute stop.

1190
01:30:48.610 --> 01:30:49.652
Did you...

1191
01:30:49.736 --> 01:30:51.278
- What?
- What's going on?

1192
01:30:51.363 --> 01:30:53.697
- Hank was coming on to me again.
- Hank!

1193
01:30:54.991 --> 01:30:57.368
Damn it. I am so sick of that guy!

1194
01:30:58.328 --> 01:31:02.039
OK, Hank, come out here. Let's settle this
the old-fashioned way. Come on!

1195
01:31:02.499 --> 01:31:05.376
I may not be tough,
but damn it, I can get good and mad!

1196
01:31:06.169 --> 01:31:08.087
Stop it, man. You're scaring me.

1197
01:31:09.005 --> 01:31:11.507
- What's the matter?
- Let's go before he wakes up.

1198
01:31:11.591 --> 01:31:14.718
I'm not through with you, buster.
I'm not through with you!

1199
01:31:22.227 --> 01:31:25.354
What's the matter, Hank?
Afraid to pick on someone your own size?

1200
01:31:28.066 --> 01:31:30.943
Are you OK? What happened?

1201
01:31:31.194 --> 01:31:32.611
That was dirty.

1202
01:31:32.737 --> 01:31:34.864
All right. Come on.

1203
01:31:35.073 --> 01:31:36.991
Where are you? Where are you?

1204
01:31:37.367 --> 01:31:39.326
Here I am.

1205
01:31:39.411 --> 01:31:41.036
You bastard!

1206
01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:46.375
Stop it, you're gonna kill him!

1207
01:31:48.086 --> 01:31:51.922
You're choking me!
You're choking me!

1208
01:31:52.841 --> 01:31:54.258
Charlie, don't break it.

1209
01:31:54.634 --> 01:31:57.052
Get on your knees and beg me. Up yours.

1210
01:32:04.352 --> 01:32:07.021
On your feet. We're gonna have fun.

1211
01:32:07.314 --> 01:32:08.772
Lrene!

1212
01:32:13.111 --> 01:32:17.114
Hi, ladies. My name is Charlie Baileygates.
Wanna see my weasel?

1213
01:32:21.912 --> 01:32:25.456
Free hot dogs here. All you can eat.
Get your foot-long and a bag of nuts.

1214
01:32:25.540 --> 01:32:29.793
No! Don't listen to him!
It's not me! It's Hank!

1215
01:32:29.878 --> 01:32:31.295
It's Hank!

1216
01:32:34.466 --> 01:32:38.135
Come back here, Hank!
I'm not through with you!

1217
01:32:45.769 --> 01:32:48.145
Had enough? Up yours.

1218
01:32:52.817 --> 01:32:54.443
Stop it, you two!

1219
01:32:58.990 --> 01:33:03.244
- It's Gerke! Come on!
- Hank, truce? For now, fucker.

1220
01:33:09.834 --> 01:33:12.253
Watch out! He's got a gun!

1221
01:33:12.712 --> 01:33:15.589
I'll follow the girl. You get Baileygates!

1222
01:33:21.596 --> 01:33:24.765
Police officer! Everybody down! Get down!

1223
01:33:32.774 --> 01:33:34.024
Outta the way!

1224
01:33:37.862 --> 01:33:41.532
Hank, we're shot!
You pussy, it's just a flesh wound. Look.

1225
01:33:52.210 --> 01:33:56.964
Look, there's keys in that car.
No, I can't go on.

1226
01:33:58.383 --> 01:34:00.592
I think...

1227
01:34:01.428 --> 01:34:04.138
I think I'm gonna faint.

1228
01:34:11.646 --> 01:34:15.024
Do you mean to say
I've gotta carry your sorry ass?

1229
01:34:16.234 --> 01:34:17.568
All right.

1230
01:34:18.528 --> 01:34:21.071
Come on, Rip Van Wussy.

1231
01:34:24.617 --> 01:34:26.368
Jesus, you're heavy.

1232
01:34:31.541 --> 01:34:33.584
Now get in there!

1233
01:34:42.093 --> 01:34:43.635
And we're gone.

1234
01:34:47.599 --> 01:34:49.433
Shit! Don't worry.

1235
01:34:53.271 --> 01:34:58.442
Hank, what have you done? Oh, my God!
Don't you just love it?

1236
01:35:17.837 --> 01:35:20.047
You are a sick pup.

1237
01:35:20.131 --> 01:35:22.383
Yeah, well, takes one to know one.

1238
01:35:22.467 --> 01:35:24.385
What are you doing? Hank?

1239
01:35:26.137 --> 01:35:27.721
Ever been bitch-slapped?

1240
01:35:28.431 --> 01:35:31.225
I'm gonna kill you, Hank! I swear to God!

1241
01:35:33.019 --> 01:35:35.854
Arrivederci, deadwood. No!

1242
01:36:23.319 --> 01:36:27.781
What are you still doin' here?
Hank, we're in this together.

1243
01:36:34.914 --> 01:36:36.498
Pritchard.

1244
01:36:36.666 --> 01:36:39.918
Cover the other end.
I want Charlie arrested on sight.

1245
01:37:14.662 --> 01:37:17.372
Hey, lrene. You just keep walking, now.

1246
01:37:28.801 --> 01:37:29.968
Lrene!

1247
01:37:36.643 --> 01:37:38.685
Baileygates, you're coming with me.

1248
01:37:38.770 --> 01:37:40.437
- Not now, Finneran.
- Yes, now!

1249
01:37:43.566 --> 01:37:46.527
That was me. Yeah, big deal.

1250
01:37:46.611 --> 01:37:49.279
- Shut up, Hank! You're so...
- Hank!

1251
01:37:50.114 --> 01:37:53.158
- Hank!
- Hey! Let her go!

1252
01:37:53.451 --> 01:37:56.119
She asked for me, asshole.
Big deal!

1253
01:38:00.917 --> 01:38:03.460
Dickie, you know I don't know anything!

1254
01:38:03.545 --> 01:38:05.462
Shut up, lrene. It's too late.

1255
01:38:13.304 --> 01:38:18.225
Hank!

1256
01:38:18.643 --> 01:38:20.435
- No way.
- Come on.

1257
01:38:30.905 --> 01:38:35.284
Oh, no. Water.
Yeah. She's screwed. I'll buy you a beer.

1258
01:38:35.535 --> 01:38:37.536
No! We're doin' it!

1259
01:38:40.206 --> 01:38:41.373
Hank!

1260
01:38:42.250 --> 01:38:45.627
Hank! What are you doing?
Give me the leg!

1261
01:38:46.671 --> 01:38:48.380
Hank, hurry!

1262
01:38:49.591 --> 01:38:51.592
This is my body!

1263
01:38:51.676 --> 01:38:54.011
Do you understand that?

1264
01:38:54.220 --> 01:38:55.846
I call the shots from now on, Hank!

1265
01:38:56.097 --> 01:38:58.223
I don't need you
to fight my battles for me!

1266
01:38:58.308 --> 01:39:02.019
If you can back down from something
this important, you're nothing at all!

1267
01:39:02.395 --> 01:39:04.980
You're nothing at all!

1268
01:39:09.861 --> 01:39:11.486
I got my leg back.

1269
01:39:11.654 --> 01:39:14.114
Oh, no. Hank!

1270
01:39:14.282 --> 01:39:16.033
I'm coming, lrene!

1271
01:39:20.204 --> 01:39:23.457
- Hank!
- It's OK, lrene.

1272
01:39:25.376 --> 01:39:27.044
Hank's gone.

1273
01:39:27.629 --> 01:39:29.838
- It's me, Charlie.
- Charlie?

1274
01:39:30.882 --> 01:39:32.841
Maybe you should go back and get help.

1275
01:39:32.925 --> 01:39:35.052
No, I can handle it.

1276
01:39:37.472 --> 01:39:40.223
I'm warning you, pal.
You're gonna get hurt.

1277
01:39:41.476 --> 01:39:43.602
Be careful, Charlie!

1278
01:39:44.187 --> 01:39:47.939
- Just do what he says, Charlie!
- Back off! Just turn around! Now!

1279
01:39:48.024 --> 01:39:50.400
Take it easy, Dickie. Take it easy.

1280
01:39:52.070 --> 01:39:53.945
There's nowhere to go.

1281
01:39:54.530 --> 01:39:56.448
Come on, Dickie.

1282
01:39:56.824 --> 01:39:58.867
Give me the gun. Come on.

1283
01:40:01.245 --> 01:40:03.330
Come on. That's it.

1284
01:40:04.916 --> 01:40:06.458
Nice and easy.

1285
01:40:17.345 --> 01:40:18.845
Where's my thumb?

1286
01:40:18.930 --> 01:40:21.306
That's kidnapping and assault!

1287
01:40:21.599 --> 01:40:23.558
- Why stop there?
- No!

1288
01:40:24.602 --> 01:40:25.936
Oh, God!

1289
01:40:28.106 --> 01:40:29.606
Whitey!

1290
01:40:29.774 --> 01:40:31.483
Rock 'n' roll!

1291
01:40:38.825 --> 01:40:40.075
Lrene!

1292
01:41:15.737 --> 01:41:18.530
- Lrene!
- What?

1293
01:41:18.906 --> 01:41:20.657
Oh, my God!

1294
01:41:30.168 --> 01:41:32.836
Keep goin'. Bring it down.

1295
01:41:33.796 --> 01:41:35.922
We're comin', Daddy! We're comin', man!

1296
01:41:36.048 --> 01:41:38.049
It's my kids!

1297
01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:46.183
Hang on, Daddy!
Grab a hold of that motherfucker, man!

1298
01:42:09.248 --> 01:42:11.666
So, how's my thumb lookin', Doc?

1299
01:42:12.084 --> 01:42:14.419
I'll let you know when I find it.

1300
01:42:14.754 --> 01:42:20.550
Lrene, Charlie,
this is Agent Steve Parfitt, FBl.

1301
01:42:20.635 --> 01:42:22.719
You must be real proud of these maniacs.

1302
01:42:23.805 --> 01:42:24.971
Oh, I am.

1303
01:42:27.350 --> 01:42:29.810
Yeah, we're proud
of this motherfucker too.

1304
01:42:31.354 --> 01:42:33.855
It's good to see you're safe, Dad.

1305
01:42:33.940 --> 01:42:35.273
The colonel informed them

1306
01:42:35.358 --> 01:42:38.193
that all the guilty parties had been
apprehended.

1307
01:42:38.277 --> 01:42:40.779
Gerke was arraigned
at a Providence hospital,

1308
01:42:41.072 --> 01:42:45.242
and Agent Boshane had been arrested
at the train station in New London.

1309
01:42:45.660 --> 01:42:49.162
But Charlie Baileygates
had other things on his mind.

1310
01:42:49.664 --> 01:42:52.332
- Charlie, nicely done.
- Thanks, Sea Bass.

1311
01:42:53.876 --> 01:42:56.670
Hey, Whitey. Listen, I wanted to tell you

1312
01:42:56.754 --> 01:42:58.732
that I really appreciate
everything you did for me.

1313
01:42:58.756 --> 01:43:00.257
I owe you a huge one.

1314
01:43:02.635 --> 01:43:05.470
And I'm truly sorry
that you had to kill again.

1315
01:43:05.555 --> 01:43:09.850
- Must be messing with your head.
- L never killed anyone before.

1316
01:43:09.934 --> 01:43:13.311
- What?
- You're a schizo who's wanted for murder,

1317
01:43:13.396 --> 01:43:14.581
and you're laying in bed next to me

1318
01:43:14.605 --> 01:43:17.566
gabbing like a 1 6-year-old girl
on the phone.

1319
01:43:17.775 --> 01:43:19.734
You freaked me out, man.

1320
01:43:20.111 --> 01:43:23.280
But what about your family?
How did they die?

1321
01:43:23.948 --> 01:43:25.532
I never said they were dead.

1322
01:43:26.409 --> 01:43:27.868
I said they were gone.

1323
01:43:28.452 --> 01:43:30.787
They moved to Phoenix, the bastards.

1324
01:43:30.997 --> 01:43:33.665
Look at me.
I wouldn't last two minutes in the desert.

1325
01:43:35.084 --> 01:43:37.127
Hey, your bandage is wet.

1326
01:43:37.628 --> 01:43:40.213
Oh, yeah?
Well, maybe it's time to come off.

1327
01:43:41.340 --> 01:43:43.967
I'm surprised it's held on this long.

1328
01:43:44.594 --> 01:43:46.469
Hey, that's not so bad.

1329
01:43:47.513 --> 01:43:49.806
Hey, Daddy, we just wanted to say that...

1330
01:43:50.474 --> 01:43:52.100
Holy shit!

1331
01:43:52.476 --> 01:43:54.686
Look, Daddy got a butthole on his face.

1332
01:43:55.479 --> 01:43:58.023
Oh, boy. Here we go.

1333
01:43:58.774 --> 01:44:01.735
He sure is
a Spartacus-lookin' motherfucker.

1334
01:44:01.819 --> 01:44:06.197
Hey, Daddy, now you can blow your nose
and wipe your ass at the same damn time!

1335
01:44:13.372 --> 01:44:15.415
You know what I'm saying?

1336
01:44:23.841 --> 01:44:25.383
- So...
- So...

1337
01:44:26.677 --> 01:44:31.264
- How'd your meeting with the shrink go?
- Wonderful.

1338
01:44:31.349 --> 01:44:33.558
Clean bill of health.
A well-rounded individual.

1339
01:44:34.602 --> 01:44:38.271
That's great, Charlie.
I'm really happy for you.

1340
01:44:38.356 --> 01:44:39.689
Thank you.

1341
01:44:40.441 --> 01:44:41.858
Well...

1342
01:44:42.693 --> 01:44:44.277
I hope if you're ever,

1343
01:44:44.820 --> 01:44:47.030
you know, around here, you'll...

1344
01:44:49.825 --> 01:44:51.451
Come and visit us.

1345
01:44:52.203 --> 01:44:53.370
Yeah.

1346
01:44:54.080 --> 01:44:57.499
- Little Rhodie.
- Biggest little state in the union.

1347
01:45:07.051 --> 01:45:09.803
- Let me get that for you.
- Thanks.

1348
01:45:13.140 --> 01:45:15.225
- Hey, lrene?
- Yeah?

1349
01:45:17.395 --> 01:45:20.271
Maybe I could come
visit you sometime soon.

1350
01:45:22.066 --> 01:45:23.358
Promise?

1351
01:45:25.653 --> 01:45:27.028
You bet.

1352
01:45:30.116 --> 01:45:33.910
And that's the word
of a Rhode Island State Trooper, ma'am.

1353
01:46:00.354 --> 01:46:05.984
I found you sittin' on a suitcase cryin'

1354
01:46:07.611 --> 01:46:14.367
Beneath my feet
I feel the rumble of a subway train, yeah

1355
01:46:15.619 --> 01:46:22.167
I laugh out loud 'cause it's the one thing
I hadn't been tryin'

1356
01:46:23.794 --> 01:46:25.545
The train came in breathless

1357
01:46:25.629 --> 01:46:27.172
The passengers restless

1358
01:46:27.256 --> 01:46:30.717
She said "Baby, you'll never change"

1359
01:46:30.801 --> 01:46:32.719
You gotta get goin'

1360
01:46:32.803 --> 01:46:34.679
You gotta keep goin'

1361
01:46:35.306 --> 01:46:38.641
Hey, the world ain't slowin' down...

1362
01:46:39.477 --> 01:46:41.269
You gotta be kidding.

1363
01:46:44.607 --> 01:46:46.399
Hold it right there.

1364
01:46:52.448 --> 01:46:55.200
Miss Waters?
I'd like you to step out of the car.

1365
01:46:55.326 --> 01:46:57.202
What did I not do now?

1366
01:46:57.369 --> 01:47:00.371
- We've reason to believe this is stolen.
- What?

1367
01:47:00.498 --> 01:47:03.792
No, no, I rented this car!

1368
01:47:04.085 --> 01:47:06.711
Would you step out of the car, please?

1369
01:47:08.506 --> 01:47:09.672
Great.

1370
01:47:11.967 --> 01:47:15.011
Front of the car, please.
Hands on the hood.

1371
01:47:15.679 --> 01:47:16.971
Spread your legs.

1372
01:47:17.223 --> 01:47:20.225
- That's great.
- Thank you. Following procedure, ma'am.

1373
01:47:22.269 --> 01:47:24.270
Oh, you guys!

1374
01:47:24.522 --> 01:47:28.942
You guys are beautiful! Look, why
don't we skip the trial, get right to it?

1375
01:47:29.026 --> 01:47:31.486
You can lock me up
and keep me here forever!

1376
01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:35.365
That's what I had planned.

1377
01:47:36.867 --> 01:47:38.118
Look.

1378
01:47:39.411 --> 01:47:43.998
- L hope her little skinny ass is reading this.
- Man, I'm pretty sure she's lookin', man.

1379
01:47:49.713 --> 01:47:51.506
Oh, Charlie.

1380
01:48:13.237 --> 01:48:15.655
It's gonna be raining wine
and roses tonight.

1381
01:48:15.739 --> 01:48:18.533
It'll be rainin' my motherfuckin' cookies

1382
01:48:18.617 --> 01:48:22.162
if this motherfucker don't stop
this turbulence shit!

1383
01:48:22.246 --> 01:48:25.665
Well, that's Charlie's story,
and I'm sticking to it.

1384
01:48:25.916 --> 01:48:29.752
They all moved in together
and lived as one big happy family.

1385
01:48:30.212 --> 01:48:34.924
Charlie and lrene, the guys,
even that nice albino fella, Whitey.

1386
01:48:35.593 --> 01:48:39.137
And I'm happy to report
Charlie got promoted to lieutenant

1387
01:48:39.430 --> 01:48:45.643
in the greatest law enforcement agency
in the land: the Rhode Island State Police.

1388
01:48:45.895 --> 01:48:49.314
Yeah, it was a regular slice of Americana.

1389
01:48:49.481 --> 01:48:53.318
Y'all come back now! Thanks
for watching our motherfuckin' movie!

Pop's thumb should be OK
if we find it within the next six hours.

1484
01:56:02.289 --> 01:56:04.624
- Sure?
- Do the math, motherfucker.

1485
01:56:04.708 --> 01:56:06.792
- Damn!
- Jeez.

1486
01:56:15.886 --> 01:56:18.512
- Fellas, I think I found it!
- What?

1487
01:56:25.062 --> 01:56:27.647
- False alarm.
- Oh, damn, Whitey!
