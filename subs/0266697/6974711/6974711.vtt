1
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.711
Do you find me sadistic?

2
00:01:33.302 --> 00:01:37.849
I bet I could
fry an egg on your forehead,

3
00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:40.184
if I wanted to.

4
00:01:42.144 --> 00:01:43.812
You know, my little one,

5
00:01:46.398 --> 00:01:48.275
i like to believe

6
00:01:49.151 --> 00:01:52.404
that you are aware enough,
even now,

7
00:01:52.571 --> 00:01:56.533
to know that there is nothing sadistic

8
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.036
in my actions.

9
00:02:00.037 --> 00:02:02.831
Maybe towards others ...

10
00:02:02.998 --> 00:02:04.291
puppets,

11
00:02:06.334 --> 00:02:07.919
not to you.

12
00:02:11.465 --> 00:02:12.883
No, my little one,

13
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.718
the,

14
00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:18.929
you see me

15
00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:21.348
to my plus

16
00:02:22.516 --> 00:02:23.642
masochistic.

17
00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:25.394
Bill ...

18
00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:27.563
it's your baby.

THE TOWN OF PASADENA, CALIFORNIA

23
00:05:42.586 --> 00:05:43.462
I am coming !

24
00:05:44.713 --> 00:05:47.591
Sarah, it's not true,
You are ahead !

25
00:06:52.529 --> 00:06:53.488
Show what you got!

26
00:06:53.655 --> 00:06:55.782
I'll get you, let's get it over with!

27
00:07:06.585 --> 00:07:07.627
Come on, bitch.

28
00:07:11.172 --> 00:07:12.798
Go ahead.

29
00:07:51.711 --> 00:07:54.172
- Mom, I'm here.
- Hi baby.

30
00:07:54.339 --> 00:07:56.049
How was the school ?

31
00:07:58.301 --> 00:08:01.971
Mom, what happened to you
to you and to the house?

32
00:08:03.473 --> 00:08:05.100
Your dirty dog

33
00:08:05.266 --> 00:08:09.521
tumbled into the living room
and played the fool, that's all.

34
00:08:09.896 --> 00:08:11.481
Barney did that?

35
00:08:12.315 --> 00:08:15.568
Don't come in.
There is broken glass everywhere,

36
00:08:15.735 --> 00:08:18.154
you could cut yourself.

37
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.578
She's an old friend
that mom had lost sight of.

38
00:08:27.037 --> 00:08:28.414
Hello.

39
00:08:28.956 --> 00:08:31.750
I am (!?@!!!)
What's your name ?

40
00:08:35.587 --> 00:08:37.714
Her name is Nikki.

41
00:08:37.881 --> 00:08:39.133
Nikki ...

42
00:08:40.259 --> 00:08:43.429
A very pretty name
for a very pretty little girl.

43
00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:46.390
How old are you, Nikki?

44
00:08:49.393 --> 00:08:50.561
Nikki ...

45
00:08:50.727 --> 00:08:52.271
(!? @ !!!) asked you a question.

46
00:08:54.064 --> 00:08:55.357
I'm four.

47
00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:57.358
Four years...

48
00:09:00.945 --> 00:09:03.156
I had a little girl once.

49
00:09:04.115 --> 00:09:06.492
She would be four years old today.

50
00:09:09.787 --> 00:09:11.539
Now my baby

51
00:09:11.706 --> 00:09:14.792
mom and her friend
have to talk between adults.

52
00:09:14.959 --> 00:09:19.046
Go to your room and leave us
until I call you

53
00:09:19.213 --> 00:09:20.506
Okay ?

54
00:09:22.467 --> 00:09:24.051
Nikkia!

55
00:09:24.218 --> 00:09:26.846
In your room, immediately.

56
00:09:39.608 --> 00:09:41.026
Do you want some coffee ?

57
00:09:41.818 --> 00:09:43.570
Yes, gladly.

58
00:09:50.952 --> 00:09:53.747
<i> This bourgeois from Pasadena
her name is Jeanne Bell. </i>

59
00:09:53.914 --> 00:09:56.291
<i> Her husband is Dr. Lawrence Bell. </i>

60
00:09:56.666 --> 00:09:59.294
<i> When we met
four years ago, </i>

61
00:09:59.461 --> 00:10:01.505
<i> her name was Vernita Green. </i>

62
00:10:01.671 --> 00:10:04.257
<i> His code name was
Copper Viper. </i>

63
00:10:04.424 --> 00:10:06.051
<i> Mine, Black Mamba. </i>

64
00:10:06.259 --> 00:10:07.552
Do you have a towel?

65
00:10:09.137 --> 00:10:10.471
Yes.

66
00:10:13.891 --> 00:10:15.100
Thank you.

67
00:10:15.267 --> 00:10:17.061
Still milk and sugar?

68
00:10:21.565 --> 00:10:23.859
Is it a bit late for an apology?

69
00:10:24.235 --> 00:10:25.819
Absoutely.

70
00:10:26.612 --> 00:10:28.113
Bitch!

71
00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:31.575
You plan to screw up the mess
in front of my little girl?

72
00:10:31.742 --> 00:10:33.577
Relax, for now.

73
00:10:35.079 --> 00:10:37.623
I will not kill you
in front of her, okay?

74
00:10:40.125 --> 00:10:43.420
You are more reasonable
than Bill led him to believe.

75
00:10:43.712 --> 00:10:47.757
I am devoid of mercy,
of compassion and pity,

76
00:10:48.216 --> 00:10:49.884
no reason.

77
00:10:56.558 --> 00:10:58.643
I know I hurt you.

78
00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:02.730
A lot, even. I wish
the opposite, but I did.

79
00:11:03.439 --> 00:11:05.817
You have all the rights
to want to be quit.

80
00:11:09.237 --> 00:11:12.282
So that we are quit, my little one,

81
00:11:13.074 --> 00:11:15.868
I would have to kill you,

82
00:11:16.035 --> 00:11:18.288
that I go up to Nikki's, that I kill her,

83
00:11:19.455 --> 00:11:23.667
that I wait for your husband to return,
good Dr Bell, and kill him.

84
00:11:24.418 --> 00:11:26.628
There, we would be quits, Vernita.

85
00:11:26.795 --> 00:11:28.922
There, we would put
the clocks to the hour.

86
00:11:29.381 --> 00:11:32.009
If I could turn back time
I will do it.

87
00:11:32.175 --> 00:11:33.844
But I can not.

88
00:11:35.178 --> 00:11:37.764
Simply,
I'm not the same at all.

89
00:11:38.974 --> 00:11:40.267
Well done.

90
00:11:41.351 --> 00:11:43.937
- I do not care.
- Certainly.

91
00:11:44.104 --> 00:11:46.857
I know I don't deserve
neither mercy nor forgiveness.

92
00:11:47.024 --> 00:11:48.108
However,

93
00:11:48.275 --> 00:11:51.028
I urge you to both
on behalf of my little girl.

94
00:11:51.945 --> 00:11:54.615
Bitch ... stop right now.

95
00:11:56.742 --> 00:11:59.619
That I don't wanna kill you
in front of your daughter

96
00:11:59.785 --> 00:12:03.831
doesn't mean to shake it to me
under the nose will make me flex.

97
00:12:05.416 --> 00:12:08.461
You and I have a score to settle.

98
00:12:08.628 --> 00:12:12.048
And all that you did
over the next four years,

99
00:12:12.214 --> 00:12:14.342
including getting knocked up,

100
00:12:14.508 --> 00:12:16.260
will not change anything.

101
00:12:17.511 --> 00:12:19.764
So when do we do this?

102
00:12:20.139 --> 00:12:22.099
It depends.

103
00:12:22.266 --> 00:12:24.810
When do you want to die

104
00:12:24.977 --> 00:12:27.647
Tomorrow ? After tomorrow ?

105
00:12:27.813 --> 00:12:31.609
- Why not tonight, bitch?
- Awesome. Where ?

106
00:12:31.776 --> 00:12:35.570
There is a baseball field near here
where I train the kids.

107
00:12:35.737 --> 00:12:39.741
We meet there around 2:30 a.m.
dressed all in black.

108
00:12:39.908 --> 00:12:42.077
Your hair camouflaged in black stockings.

109
00:12:42.243 --> 00:12:44.954
And we fight with knives.

110
00:12:45.121 --> 00:12:47.082
No one will come and disturb us.

111
00:12:47.248 --> 00:12:48.375
Now,

112
00:12:50.126 --> 00:12:51.878
I cook Nikki's snack.

113
00:13:01.096 --> 00:13:04.265
According to Bill, you are almost
unbeatable with a knife.

114
00:13:04.474 --> 00:13:06.643
Fuck you, bitch.

115
00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:09.104
I know he didn't put
flat.

116
00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:12.815
So, I repeat,
fuck you, Black Mamba.

117
00:13:13.857 --> 00:13:15.359
"Black Mamba" ...

118
00:13:16.026 --> 00:13:18.779
It’s me who should have been
Black Mamba.

119
00:13:19.238 --> 00:13:22.449
If you want to help yourself
with your butcher's knife, go ahead.

120
00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:25.369
Very funny, bitch.

121
00:13:26.954 --> 00:13:28.497
Very funny !

122
00:14:26.344 --> 00:14:29.514
I really didn't want to
do this in front of you.

123
00:14:31.641 --> 00:14:33.602
And I'm sorry about that.

124
00:14:35.187 --> 00:14:36.980
But take my word for it.

125
00:14:40.317 --> 00:14:42.778
Your mother had been looking for it.

126
00:14:57.626 --> 00:14:59.336
When you grow up

127
00:15:00.796 --> 00:15:03.839
if it still hurts you,

128
00:15:07.802 --> 00:15:09.762
I will wait for you.

129
00:15:13.641 --> 00:15:16.018
<i> For a true warrior, </i>

130
00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.854
<i> when he engages in a fight, </i>

131
00:15:19.021 --> 00:15:23.984
<i> defeat your enemy
must be the only concern. </i>

132
00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:30.699
<i> Suppresses all human emotion,
stifles all compassion ... </i>

133
00:15:36.705 --> 00:15:43.044
<i> Kill whoever gets in your way,
be it God or Buddha himself. </i>

134
00:15:43.503 --> 00:15:45.922
LIST OF FIVE TO KILL

135
00:15:49.551 --> 00:15:54.389
<i> This is the very foundation
the art of combat. </i>

136
00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:03.231
BAISODROME

137
00:16:11.114 --> 00:16:14.825
THE BRIDE WAS BLOOD

138
00:16:20.831 --> 00:16:25.794
<i> Four and a half years earlier in El Paso. </i>

139
00:17:07.168 --> 00:17:08.085
Then ?

140
00:17:08.794 --> 00:17:11.964
Give me the details
the bloodiest, Son # 1.

141
00:17:12.131 --> 00:17:14.300
It's a massacre, dad.

142
00:17:16.177 --> 00:17:19.555
He executed all the guests,
in a gangster style.

143
00:17:21.933 --> 00:17:23.267
Give me a number.

144
00:17:23.434 --> 00:17:25.311
Nine corpses.

145
00:17:25.478 --> 00:17:28.021
And that means all the smala.

146
00:17:28.188 --> 00:17:29.481
The bride,

147
00:17:29.648 --> 00:17:30.982
the groom,

148
00:17:31.149 --> 00:17:32.651
Pastor,

149
00:17:32.817 --> 00:17:34.819
the pastor's wife ...

150
00:17:35.403 --> 00:17:38.657
They even shot
on the old black organist.

151
00:17:39.991 --> 00:17:44.371
Obviously, someone was opposed
at this wedding and refused to be silent.

152
00:17:49.042 --> 00:17:52.504
Well say so!

153
00:17:58.510 --> 00:17:59.636
Like I said, daddy,

154
00:18:00.136 --> 00:18:03.347
looks like a fucking squadron
of Nicaraguan death.

155
00:18:03.514 --> 00:18:07.518
Mollo on swear words,
you are in a place of worship.

156
00:18:07.685 --> 00:18:08.227
Sorry.

157
00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:13.691
It's a professional job.

158
00:18:14.024 --> 00:18:17.987
At first glance, henchmen
of the Mexican Mafia.

159
00:18:18.946 --> 00:18:21.407
Four, maybe five.

160
00:18:21.573 --> 00:18:22.825
Why do you say that ?

161
00:18:23.701 --> 00:18:26.495
It is the work of a sure and firm hand.

162
00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:30.124
Not that of a needy amateur ...

163
00:18:30.541 --> 00:18:33.460
It is that of an old man of the old.

164
00:18:34.128 --> 00:18:37.131
It shows in the cleanliness of the carnage ...

165
00:18:37.423 --> 00:18:40.133
Although it looks
of an explosion of rage,

166
00:18:40.466 --> 00:18:43.428
all colors are
below this line.

167
00:18:44.053 --> 00:18:47.181
If you were crazy
you could almost admire.

168
00:18:59.652 --> 00:19:02.488
- Who's the bride?
- I do not know.

169
00:19:03.239 --> 00:19:07.326
The name on the certificate
marriage is Arlene Machiavelli.

170
00:19:07.952 --> 00:19:09.579
It's a fake.

171
00:19:09.996 --> 00:19:13.041
We called her "the bride"
because of her dress.

172
00:19:13.207 --> 00:19:15.501
You can tell she was pregnant.

173
00:19:16.835 --> 00:19:21.214
The killer must be damn twisted
for turning on such a beautiful girl.

174
00:19:23.592 --> 00:19:25.052
Look at her.

175
00:19:27.512 --> 00:19:29.347
Hair as golden as wheat ...

176
00:19:29.931 --> 00:19:31.349
Big eyes.

177
00:19:32.559 --> 00:19:35.103
A little angel stained with blood.

178
00:19:39.024 --> 00:19:41.359
Son n ° 1 ...

179
00:19:42.027 --> 00:19:46.448
that fucking cock eater
is not dead.

180
00:22:00.286 --> 00:22:03.122
SHE DRIVER
member of "VIPÈRES ASSASSINES"

181
00:22:03.289 --> 00:22:05.499
code name:Mountain Snake

182
00:22:21.514 --> 00:22:24.267
I may never have loved you.

183
00:22:25.518 --> 00:22:28.063
In fact, I despise you.

184
00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:34.110
But do not deduce
that I disrespect you.

185
00:22:37.322 --> 00:22:39.241
Die in his sleep

186
00:22:39.407 --> 00:22:43.370
is a luxury than ours
can rarely afford.

187
00:22:43.745 --> 00:22:45.413
It's a gift

188
00:22:45.872 --> 00:22:47.582
that I do to you.

189
00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:00.135
Hi, Bill.

190
00:23:02.388 --> 00:23:03.889
What condition is she in?

191
00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:06.100
In the coma.

192
00:23:07.101 --> 00:23:08.435
Where is she ?

193
00:23:08.769 --> 00:23:11.730
Just next to me.

194
00:23:12.231 --> 00:23:13.899
Well done, my little one.

195
00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:19.738
Her, you interrupt the mission.

196
00:23:20.823 --> 00:23:22.199
We owe him better than that.

197
00:23:22.408 --> 00:23:24.034
You don't owe him anything!

198
00:23:24.576 --> 00:23:25.786
Lower your voice.

199
00:23:26.036 --> 00:23:27.705
You don't owe him anything!

200
00:23:27.913 --> 00:23:29.873
Can I say something?

201
00:23:30.082 --> 00:23:31.165
Speak.

202
00:23:33.418 --> 00:23:37.046
You all fall on him,
but she does not die.

203
00:23:37.213 --> 00:23:41.968
I put a bullet in his head
but her heart continues to beat.

204
00:23:42.635 --> 00:23:46.723
You saw it yourself,
of the beautiful blue eye that you have left.

205
00:23:46.889 --> 00:23:48.683
No ?

206
00:23:49.809 --> 00:23:52.812
We did a lot of things to him,
to this woman ...

207
00:23:53.479 --> 00:23:57.525
and if she ever wakes up,
we will do much more to him.

208
00:23:59.027 --> 00:24:00.820
But one thing we don't do

209
00:24:00.987 --> 00:24:05.158
it's slipping into your room
in the middle of the night like a sewer rat

210
00:24:05.658 --> 00:24:06.950
and kill her

211
00:24:07.117 --> 00:24:08.744
in his sleep.

212
00:24:09.369 --> 00:24:11.872
And why don't we do it?

213
00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.373
Because...

214
00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:16.543
that would bring us down.

215
00:24:17.544 --> 00:24:19.296
Isn't it, Miss Driver?

216
00:24:21.548 --> 00:24:22.549
I suppose.

217
00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:25.218
Do you "assume"?

218
00:24:26.553 --> 00:24:30.015
No I don't have to assume

219
00:24:30.557 --> 00:24:32.351
I know.

220
00:24:33.352 --> 00:24:34.728
Come home.

221
00:24:36.313 --> 00:24:37.898
Affirmative.

222
00:24:39.608 --> 00:24:41.526
I love you so much.

223
00:24:42.194 --> 00:24:43.903
I love you too.

224
00:24:59.668 --> 00:25:01.921
I find it rather funny, don't you?

225
00:25:05.299 --> 00:25:08.052
A word of advice, bitch.

226
00:25:08.469 --> 00:25:11.013
Never wake up.

227
00:25:12.765 --> 00:25:16.769
Four years later.

228
00:25:46.297 --> 00:25:49.175
<i> There, you see me ... </i>

229
00:25:50.885 --> 00:25:53.346
<i> to my most masochistic ... </i>

230
00:25:53.513 --> 00:25:55.973
<i> Bill, it's your baby. </i>

231
00:26:59.076 --> 00:27:01.204
My baby !

232
00:27:27.395 --> 00:27:28.980
Four years...

233
00:27:29.731 --> 00:27:31.483
Four years.

234
00:28:00.803 --> 00:28:03.305
It's $ 75 a shot.

235
00:28:03.472 --> 00:28:04.890
Do you take, yes or shit?

236
00:28:05.057 --> 00:28:06.600
Downright !

237
00:28:14.733 --> 00:28:16.110
Here are the rules.

238
00:28:16.277 --> 00:28:18.362
Rule n ° 1:don't knock.

239
00:28:18.529 --> 00:28:21.948
If tomorrow she has a shell
or fewer teeth, finished.

240
00:28:22.115 --> 00:28:24.492
So no gnons, no matter what.

241
00:28:24.659 --> 00:28:28.079
By the way, that bitch is drooling.
Question of reflex.

242
00:28:28.246 --> 00:28:29.956
But whether she drools or not, no gnons.

243
00:28:30.123 --> 00:28:32.875
Are we clear on rule # 1?

244
00:28:33.376 --> 00:28:37.088
Well. Rule n ° 2:
no bite, no hickey.

245
00:28:37.255 --> 00:28:39.090
In fact, leave no trace.

246
00:28:39.257 --> 00:28:42.176
Other than that, good stuff.

247
00:28:43.052 --> 00:28:46.014
Its plumbing sucks,
so you can cum inside her.

248
00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:49.934
Don't mess around.
I'll be back in twenty minutes.

249
00:28:54.314 --> 00:28:54.981
By the way...

250
00:28:56.482 --> 00:28:59.484
Sometimes her pussy stays drier
than a sandbox.

251
00:28:59.651 --> 00:29:01.987
In this case, lubricate with that.

252
00:29:04.197 --> 00:29:05.991
Bon appétit, old man.

253
00:29:20.255 --> 00:29:24.509
You are the hottest girl
that I'm banging today.

254
00:30:13.014 --> 00:30:15.100
Hey, the stallion! It's time.

255
00:30:15.266 --> 00:30:18.311
I'm going in whether you're done or not.
Did you have a good time?

256
00:30:52.302 --> 00:30:53.595
Where's Bill?

257
00:30:54.972 --> 00:30:56.473
Where's Bill?

258
00:30:58.058 --> 00:30:58.934
Stopped...

259
00:30:59.101 --> 00:31:00.144
Where's Bill?

260
00:31:02.146 --> 00:31:04.857
- I don't know who Bill is!
- Liar !

261
00:31:12.948 --> 00:31:16.577
<i> Hey, you're even more cute
that I had been told. </i>

262
00:31:16.744 --> 00:31:19.079
<i> "Jeanne X" ... The total unknown. </i>

263
00:31:19.246 --> 00:31:21.832
<i> I'm from Huntsville, Texas. </i>

264
00:31:21.999 --> 00:31:23.708
<i> My name is Buckaroo, </i>

265
00:31:23.875 --> 00:31:25.960
<i> and I come to take a shot. </i>

266
00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:32.383
"Buckaroo", right?

267
00:31:34.385 --> 00:31:38.473
"And you're coming to take a shot", right?

268
00:32:05.874 --> 00:32:07.501
"Baisodrome"

269
00:32:08.251 --> 00:32:09.669
Assfucked!

270
00:32:37.446 --> 00:32:38.739
Texas...

271
00:32:46.705 --> 00:32:48.707
BAISODROME

272
00:34:25.801 --> 00:34:27.803
Wiggle the big toe.

273
00:34:32.683 --> 00:34:34.477
Wiggle the big toe.

274
00:35:00.044 --> 00:35:05.006
<i> Stretched out in the back seat,
trying to get out of my paralysis ... </i>

275
00:35:06.758 --> 00:35:10.553
<i> I saw the faces
of my bastards of aggressors </i>

276
00:35:10.762 --> 00:35:13.556
<i> and the motherfucker running them. </i>

277
00:35:15.058 --> 00:35:16.685
<i> All members </i>

278
00:35:17.268 --> 00:35:20.563
<i> of the International Detachment
of the Assassinated Vipers. </i>

279
00:35:22.691 --> 00:35:26.987
<i> When fortune smiles on violence
and the ugliness of revenge, </i>

280
00:35:27.153 --> 00:35:30.991
<i> it seems irrefutable proof
not only that God exists, </i>

281
00:35:31.157 --> 00:35:33.034
<i> but that we carry out our will. </i>

282
00:35:33.201 --> 00:35:35.704
<i> While I was ignorant of everything
of my enemies, </i>

283
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:39.581
<i> the first on my list, O-Ren Ishii, </i>

284
00:35:39.748 --> 00:35:41.875
<i> was the easiest to find. </i>

285
00:35:42.042 --> 00:35:47.006
<i> When we assume the delicate function
of Tokyo Crime Queen, </i>

286
00:35:47.172 --> 00:35:49.425
<i> we don't make it a secret ... </i>

287
00:35:49.591 --> 00:35:53.470
O-REN ISHII
member of "VIPÈRES ASSASSINES"

288
00:35:53.637 --> 00:35:57.307
code name:Water Moccasin

289
00:35:59.059 --> 00:36:02.604
THE ORIGINS OF O-REN

290
00:36:03.564 --> 00:36:08.694
<i> O-Ren Ishii was born
on an American base in Tokyo. </i>

291
00:36:09.695 --> 00:36:12.990
<i> Military girl,
half Japanese, half Chinese-American, </i>

292
00:36:13.157 --> 00:36:16.659
<i> she discovered death
at the age of nine </i>

293
00:36:16.826 --> 00:36:19.746
<i> when she attended
on the death of his parents </i>

294
00:36:19.912 --> 00:36:23.624
<i> from the hand of Chief Yakuza
the fiercest in Japan, </i>

295
00:36:23.791 --> 00:36:26.252
<i> Boss Matsumoto. </i>

296
00:38:04.222 --> 00:38:06.724
GROAN

297
00:39:41.776 --> 00:39:42.652
Mom !

298
00:40:52.344 --> 00:40:54.388
<i> She swore revenge. </i>

299
00:40:55.014 --> 00:40:56.640
<i> Lucky for her, </i>

300
00:40:56.807 --> 00:40:58.726
<i> Boss Matsumoto </i>

301
00:40:58.892 --> 00:41:00.519
<i> was a pedophile. </i>

302
00:41:02.313 --> 00:41:05.732
<i> At 11, she managed to get revenge. </i>

303
00:41:11.029 --> 00:41:12.238
Look at me.

304
00:41:14.490 --> 00:41:17.452
Take a good look at my face.

305
00:41:19.579 --> 00:41:21.331
Look at my eyes.

306
00:41:24.542 --> 00:41:26.627
Look at my mouth.

307
00:41:28.046 --> 00:41:29.881
I don't remind you of anything?

308
00:41:31.883 --> 00:41:34.093
I don't look like someone

309
00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:35.803
that you murdered?

310
00:42:49.208 --> 00:42:50.292
<i> At 20, </i>

311
00:42:50.459 --> 00:42:54.046
<i> she was one of the most
great killers of the world. </i>

312
00:43:41.633 --> 00:43:46.513
<i> At 25, she participated
the slaughter of nine innocent people, </i>

313
00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:49.475
<i> including my unborn daughter, </i>

314
00:43:49.641 --> 00:43:53.812
<i> in a small chapel
from El Paso, Texas. </i>

315
00:43:54.104 --> 00:43:55.606
<i> But that day, </i>

316
00:43:55.814 --> 00:43:57.608
<i> four years ago, </i>

317
00:43:57.774 --> 00:44:01.278
<i> she made a big mistake. </i>

318
00:44:01.778 --> 00:44:04.239
<i> She should have killed ten. </i>

319
00:44:05.115 --> 00:44:06.283
<i> However, </i>

320
00:44:06.450 --> 00:44:09.410
<i> before I get satisfaction ... </i>

321
00:44:09.577 --> 00:44:10.786
<i> let's proceed in order. </i>

322
00:44:11.662 --> 00:44:14.415
Wiggle the big toe.

323
00:44:21.672 --> 00:44:23.299
The hardest thing is done.

324
00:44:24.133 --> 00:44:27.595
Now,
if we made the others wiggle ...

325
00:44:29.055 --> 00:44:31.307
Thirteen hours later

326
00:45:02.212 --> 00:45:04.214
Welcome to Air O.
I can help you ?

327
00:45:04.464 --> 00:45:06.591
Okinawa. One way ticket.

328
00:45:16.268 --> 00:45:20.563
THE OKINAWA MAN

329
00:45:25.150 --> 00:45:28.028
OKINAWA ISLAND, JAPAN

330
00:45:33.867 --> 00:45:34.994
Hello.

331
00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:37.121
Welcome.

332
00:45:41.959 --> 00:45:43.294
Welcome.

333
00:45:44.712 --> 00:45:46.422
You are english ?

334
00:45:46.839 --> 00:45:48.841
Almost. American.

335
00:45:49.216 --> 00:45:51.635
So, welcome, American.

336
00:45:54.263 --> 00:45:57.015
My English is excellent.

337
00:45:57.181 --> 00:45:58.308
<i> You said domo. </i>

338
00:45:58.766 --> 00:46:00.393
Do you speak Japanese?

339
00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:04.397
No. Just a few words
that I learned since yesterday.

340
00:46:06.107 --> 00:46:10.069
- Can I sit at the bar?
- Sure ! You're welcome.

341
00:46:13.656 --> 00:46:15.908
What other words have you learned?

342
00:46:17.535 --> 00:46:18.369
A moment.

343
00:46:18.536 --> 00:46:22.874
We have clients. Quick tea!

344
00:46:23.207 --> 00:46:25.752
I watch my soap operas!

345
00:46:25.918 --> 00:46:27.128
Shit.

346
00:46:27.295 --> 00:46:29.297
Dirty sloth ...

347
00:46:29.631 --> 00:46:31.841
Who cares, your soap operas!

348
00:46:32.008 --> 00:46:35.302
It is boiling,
give it to him for once.

349
00:46:35.469 --> 00:46:38.889
Shut up ! Get your ass!

350
00:46:39.931 --> 00:46:41.516
Sorry.

351
00:46:44.144 --> 00:46:46.229
What else in Japanese?

352
00:46:47.481 --> 00:46:48.899
Let's see ...

353
00:46:55.822 --> 00:46:57.949
<i> I already said domo, right? </i>

354
00:47:05.165 --> 00:47:06.124
Repeat.

355
00:47:07.709 --> 00:47:09.377
Perfect. Very well.

356
00:47:10.878 --> 00:47:13.506
Tell you japanese words
as if you Japanese.

357
00:47:13.673 --> 00:47:15.383
You are laughing at me !

358
00:47:15.841 --> 00:47:17.510
Very serious !

359
00:47:17.927 --> 00:47:20.513
Very good pronunciation.

360
00:47:21.263 --> 00:47:25.267
<i> Tell you Arigato
as Arigato tell us. </i>

361
00:47:28.562 --> 00:47:31.941
<i> Thanks. Sorry:Arigato. </i>

362
00:47:33.693 --> 00:47:35.945
You should learn Japanese.

363
00:47:36.112 --> 00:47:37.321
Very easy.

364
00:47:38.197 --> 00:47:40.116
It seems it's pretty hard.

365
00:47:40.282 --> 00:47:41.367
Very difficult !

366
00:47:42.451 --> 00:47:44.453
But you have Japanese language.

367
00:47:57.257 --> 00:48:02.095
So is this tea coming?
Hurry up, shit!

368
00:48:06.307 --> 00:48:08.226
Train-slipper ...

369
00:48:14.524 --> 00:48:16.651
What do you want ?

370
00:48:17.152 --> 00:48:18.528
Sorry ?

371
00:48:20.488 --> 00:48:21.614
To drink.

372
00:48:23.407 --> 00:48:25.242
A bottle of hot sake.

373
00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:29.538
Hot sake? Excellent!

374
00:48:29.705 --> 00:48:30.664
Hot sake!

375
00:48:31.248 --> 00:48:34.126
Sake? In the middle of the day?

376
00:48:35.002 --> 00:48:39.089
Morning, evening, afternoon, who cares?
Go get the sake!

377
00:48:39.256 --> 00:48:42.050
Why am I always going there?

378
00:48:42.217 --> 00:48:43.677
Listen to me carefully !

379
00:48:44.011 --> 00:48:47.055
For thirty years,
I'm just looking for the sake.

380
00:48:47.222 --> 00:48:48.974
We would be in the army

381
00:48:49.141 --> 00:48:52.686
I would already be a general.

382
00:48:52.895 --> 00:48:55.522
Ah, would you be a general?

383
00:48:55.773 --> 00:48:59.358
If you were a general, I would be emperor.

384
00:48:59.692 --> 00:49:03.988
And you would stay on sake chore!
So close it and go get it!

385
00:49:04.655 --> 00:49:05.490
Pigeon?

386
00:49:05.907 --> 00:49:07.617
I am neither bald nor deaf!

387
00:49:07.784 --> 00:49:08.576
Pigeon?

388
00:49:13.164 --> 00:49:14.207
Sorry.

389
00:49:18.503 --> 00:49:19.879
First time in Japan?

390
00:49:21.714 --> 00:49:23.925
What brings you to Okinawa?

391
00:49:24.675 --> 00:49:26.302
I came to see a man.

392
00:49:29.388 --> 00:49:30.890
Got a friend in Okinawa?

393
00:49:32.225 --> 00:49:33.559
Not quite.

394
00:49:33.893 --> 00:49:35.227
Not a friend?

395
00:49:35.811 --> 00:49:36.978
I never saw it.

396
00:49:37.145 --> 00:49:38.605
Never ?

397
00:49:39.397 --> 00:49:42.359
Who is this, if I may?

398
00:49:43.902 --> 00:49:45.737
Hattori Hanzo.

399
00:49:58.458 --> 00:50:01.419
What do you want with him?

400
00:50:02.838 --> 00:50:05.507
I need a Japanese blade.

401
00:50:07.759 --> 00:50:10.428
And why do you need it?

402
00:50:12.388 --> 00:50:15.307
I have vermin to exterminate.

403
00:50:18.644 --> 00:50:23.691
You must have some really big rats,
to have recourse to Hattori Hanzo.

404
00:50:26.861 --> 00:50:28.279
Huge.

405
00:51:56.406 --> 00:51:57.407
I can ?

406
00:51:58.700 --> 00:51:59.660
You can.

407
00:52:03.329 --> 00:52:03.996
Wait.

408
00:52:04.956 --> 00:52:07.124
Try the second from the top.

409
00:53:00.301 --> 00:53:01.469
It's funny.

410
00:53:02.429 --> 00:53:04.556
You like samurai swords ...

411
00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:10.061
me, i like baseball.

412
00:53:18.027 --> 00:53:20.696
I wanted to show them to you.

413
00:53:21.572 --> 00:53:22.948
However,

414
00:53:23.782 --> 00:53:27.453
you who know so much,
surely also know

415
00:53:27.911 --> 00:53:32.833
that I no longer manufacture
instruments of death.

416
00:53:34.251 --> 00:53:35.836
What i have here

417
00:53:36.670 --> 00:53:42.176
I keep it for its value
aesthetic and emotional.

418
00:53:43.469 --> 00:53:48.140
But so proud that I am
of my work,

419
00:53:52.435 --> 00:53:55.897
I retired.

420
00:54:03.863 --> 00:54:05.907
So give me one of them.

421
00:54:06.074 --> 00:54:08.201
These are not for sale.

422
00:54:09.827 --> 00:54:12.121
I didn't say "sell me",

423
00:54:12.288 --> 00:54:13.748
I said "Give it to me".

424
00:54:16.125 --> 00:54:19.003
Why should I help you?

425
00:54:19.754 --> 00:54:24.217
Because my vermin is
one of your former students.

426
00:54:26.968 --> 00:54:28.678
And seen the student,

427
00:54:30.388 --> 00:54:35.060
I would say your obligation
is size.

428
00:55:31.699 --> 00:55:33.534
You can sleep here.

429
00:55:34.493 --> 00:55:37.121
It will take me a month

430
00:55:39.581 --> 00:55:41.499
to make this saber.

431
00:55:42.250 --> 00:55:43.960
Spend it practicing.

432
00:56:16.783 --> 00:56:20.245
A MONTH LATER

433
00:57:13.547 --> 00:57:15.132
I finished

434
00:57:17.134 --> 00:57:21.180
what i swore
twenty-eight years ago

435
00:57:23.474 --> 00:57:26.519
never to do again.

436
00:57:29.813 --> 00:57:32.691
I created
"something that kills people".

437
00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:37.195
And from this point of view,

438
00:57:38.321 --> 00:57:39.906
I succeeded.

439
00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:46.288
I did it
because philosophically,

440
00:57:47.372 --> 00:57:52.752
I sympathize with your quest.

441
00:57:56.047 --> 00:57:57.257
I say it without vanity,

442
00:57:58.633 --> 00:58:01.469
it is the most beautiful saber
of my career.

443
00:58:03.054 --> 00:58:06.056
If on the way you meet God,

444
00:58:06.223 --> 00:58:09.310
He would be cut to pieces.

445
00:58:22.072 --> 00:58:24.325
Warrior with golden hair ...

446
00:58:24.491 --> 00:58:25.993
go.

447
00:58:42.759 --> 00:58:48.097
BATTLE STORED AT THE "BLUE VILLA"

448
00:58:50.224 --> 00:58:53.603
<i> It's a year later
the massacre of El Paso, Texas, </i>

449
00:58:53.978 --> 00:58:57.607
<i> that Bill supported his Japanese protege
financially and morally </i>

450
00:58:57.774 --> 00:59:01.861
<i> in his Shakespearean fight
against the other Yakuza clans </i>

451
00:59:02.028 --> 00:59:05.656
<i> for defect control
in the city of Tokyo. </i>

452
00:59:06.449 --> 00:59:08.743
<i> When the last sword was sheathed, </i>

453
00:59:08.910 --> 00:59:12.288
<i> it was O-Ren Ishii and his gang, </i>

454
00:59:12.872 --> 00:59:16.584
<i> the Crazy 88s,
who emerged victorious. </i>

455
00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:23.423
<i> The pretty woman to the right of O-Ren,
dressed as a villain from Star Trek, </i>

456
00:59:23.590 --> 00:59:27.594
<i> is O-Ren's lawyer,
her best friend and her lieutenant, </i>

457
00:59:27.761 --> 00:59:31.098
<i> half-French, half-Japanese:
Sophie Fatale. </i>

458
00:59:31.890 --> 00:59:34.893
<i> Another former protégé of Bill. </i>

459
00:59:37.604 --> 00:59:41.900
<i> The young schoolgirl in uniform is
O-Ren's personal bodyguard, </i>

460
00:59:42.067 --> 00:59:44.277
<i> Gogo Yubari, 17 years old. </i>

461
00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:46.822
<i> Gogo may be young, </i>

462
00:59:46.988 --> 00:59:51.034
<i> but his youth is compensated
by the excess of his madness. </i>

463
00:59:51.284 --> 00:59:53.120
Do you like Ferraris?

464
00:59:56.914 --> 00:59:59.041
Ferrari ... Italian shit.

465
01:00:08.968 --> 01:00:10.261
Do you want to fuck with me?

466
01:00:12.388 --> 01:00:15.349
Do not laugh.
Do you want to fuck me, yes or no?

467
01:00:16.851 --> 01:00:18.144
Yes.

468
01:00:21.897 --> 01:00:23.232
What now, my big one?

469
01:00:24.483 --> 01:00:26.277
You still want to penetrate me ...

470
01:00:29.447 --> 01:00:30.738
where is it me

471
01:00:30.905 --> 01:00:32.699
who penetrated you?

472
01:00:34.325 --> 01:00:35.952
<i> Do you see what I mean? </i>

473
01:00:37.579 --> 01:00:42.000
<i> The bald man in Kato costume and mask
his name is Johnny Mo, </i>

474
01:00:42.167 --> 01:00:46.463
<i> the head of the personal army
from O-Ren, the Crazy 88s. </i>

475
01:00:48.506 --> 01:00:50.633
<i> And if you are wondering </i>

476
01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:54.596
<i> how a half-blood
Chinese-Japanese-American </i>

477
01:00:54.762 --> 01:00:58.850
<i> becomes the godfather
of all the Tokyo sponsors ... </i>

478
01:00:59.809 --> 01:01:01.311
<i> I'll tell you. </i>

479
01:01:01.478 --> 01:01:04.105
<i> O-Ren's blood and nationality </i>

480
01:01:04.272 --> 01:01:06.857
<i> were not mentioned
that once in the Council, </i>

481
01:01:07.024 --> 01:01:11.195
<i> the same evening
where O-Ren seized power there. </i>

482
01:01:12.279 --> 01:01:17.034
<i> This apparently determined man
to break the atmosphere is Boss Tanaka. </i>

483
01:01:17.201 --> 01:01:19.912
<i> And Boss Tanaka doesn't think
only one thing ... </i>

484
01:01:24.374 --> 01:01:25.375
Boss Tanaka!

485
01:01:25.876 --> 01:01:27.544
What does this sparkle mean?

486
01:01:27.711 --> 01:01:29.254
In full celebration!

487
01:01:29.421 --> 01:01:32.549
What are we celebrating, exactly?

488
01:01:34.051 --> 01:01:36.386
Perversion
of our illustrious Council?

489
01:01:38.347 --> 01:01:41.558
Tanaka, are you losing your mind?

490
01:01:41.725 ​​--> 01:01:42.558
It's intolerable !

491
01:01:42.725 --> 01:01:45.228
You insult our sister. Apologize !

492
01:01:46.145 --> 01:01:47.146
Tanaka-San,

493
01:01:48.397 --> 01:01:51.400
what perversion are you talking about?

494
01:01:57.323 --> 01:01:58.407
My father,

495
01:01:59.450 --> 01:02:01.869
with yours,
founded this Council.

496
01:02:03.246 --> 01:02:05.831
And while you laugh stupidly,

four hundred ninety seven
01:02:05.998 --> 01:02:08.042
they cry in the afterlife ...

498
01:02:08.626 --> 01:02:09.335
Quite !

499
01:02:10.503 --> 01:02:12.922
... on perversion
perpetrated today!

500
01:02:13.089 --> 01:02:15.800
It is a scandal !

501
01:02:16.384 --> 01:02:18.386
You are insulting this Council.

502
01:02:18.553 --> 01:02:19.928
You bastard!

503
01:02:20.595 --> 01:02:21.972
Motherfucker !

504
01:02:22.138 --> 01:02:23.098
Gentlemen ...

505
01:02:25.934 --> 01:02:31.439
Tanaka obviously has something
that worries him.

506
01:02:33.108 --> 01:02:37.279
Thanks,
allow him to express himself.

507
01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:42.659
I'm talking about perversion
inflicted on this Council,

508
01:02:44.452 --> 01:02:45.287
that I love

509
01:02:46.621 --> 01:02:48.582
more than my own children,

510
01:02:49.207 --> 01:02:54.004
by the election at its head of a mixed race
Chinese, Japanese and American!

511
01:03:14.356 --> 01:03:18.527
To show you how
I'm serious,

512
01:03:21.155 --> 01:03:23.324
I'll tell you this in English.

513
01:03:37.587 --> 01:03:39.505
As your leader,

514
01:03:39.672 --> 01:03:43.635
I encourage you, sometimes,
but always respectfully,

515
01:03:43.801 --> 01:03:45.887
to question my choices.

516
01:03:46.054 --> 01:03:50.683
If you are not convinced
by one of my choices, tell me.

517
01:03:50.850 --> 01:03:54.520
But let me also
to convince you, and I promise you

518
01:03:54.687 --> 01:03:58.024
that no subject will ever be taboo.

519
01:03:58.316 --> 01:04:01.361
Except, of course,
the one just discussed.

520
01:04:04.155 --> 01:04:05.657
And whoever

521
01:04:05.823 --> 01:04:10.369
will affect my origins
of a negative connotation

522
01:04:10.535 --> 01:04:12.621
will pay for it with his fucking head.

523
01:04:13.288 --> 01:04:15.082
Like that junk.

524
01:04:17.709 --> 01:04:20.128
And now if any of you dogs

525
01:04:20.295 --> 01:04:22.255
has something to add,

526
01:04:22.422 --> 01:04:24.841
it's now or never !

527
01:04:27.052 --> 01:04:28.512
That is what I thought.

528
01:04:31.890 --> 01:04:33.892
Gentlemen, the meeting is adjourned.

529
01:04:34.935 --> 01:04:36.561
A ticket to Tokyo.

530
01:09:33.558 --> 01:09:34.476
Gogo.

531
01:11:49.857 --> 01:11:52.568
Say yes to everything
even the most selfish stuff.

532
01:11:52.735 --> 01:11:54.278
They demand ridiculous stuff.

533
01:11:54.445 --> 01:11:56.614
Shut your mouth. If they heard you ...

534
01:11:56.781 --> 01:11:57.573
What would happen?

535
01:11:57.740 --> 01:11:58.991
Think of the Tanaka clan.

536
01:11:59.158 --> 01:12:00.951
Do you want your head cut off?

537
01:12:01.118 --> 01:12:02.702
I wouldn't like that.

538
01:12:50.166 --> 01:12:51.208
Yes it's me.

539
01:12:55.546 --> 01:12:58.716
Give me your number,
we will call you back.

540
01:13:13.189 --> 01:13:14.314
You !

541
01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:16.858
Who do you remind me of?

542
01:13:18.151 --> 01:13:20.111
To Charlie Brown!

543
01:13:21.029 --> 01:13:23.489
That's right, it looks like Charlie Brown!

544
01:13:23.656 --> 01:13:24.699
Charlie Brown.

545
01:13:24.866 --> 01:13:26.576
Four pizzas with peppers.

546
01:13:26.743 --> 01:13:27.994
It's not on the menu.

547
01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:30.705
I don't care, bring them!

548
01:13:31.664 --> 01:13:34.459
Say, Charlie, are you giving me a kiss?

549
01:13:36.002 --> 01:13:37.837
O-Ren Ishii!

550
01:13:39.130 ​​--> 01:13:41.633
We have a score to settle!

551
01:14:11.995 --> 01:14:13.205
(!? @ !!!)

552
01:15:11.594 --> 01:15:14.097
Charlie Brown, leave us.

553
01:15:22.063 --> 01:15:22.814
Miki.

554
01:15:41.457 --> 01:15:42.916
Gut that bitch for me!

555
01:17:13.672 --> 01:17:15.090
So, O-Ren,

556
01:17:16.216 --> 01:17:18.927
you have other underlings
to get me killed?

557
01:17:23.557 --> 01:17:25.058
Gogo, is that it?

558
01:17:26.685 --> 01:17:27.561
Bingo.

559
01:17:28.186 --> 01:17:29.770
And you, you are Black Mamba.

560
01:17:32.523 --> 01:17:35.151
Our reputations precede us.

561
01:17:36.402 --> 01:17:37.528
Is not it ?

562
01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:44.660
I know you have to
protect your mistress,

563
01:17:45.911 --> 01:17:47.538
but I beg you,

564
01:17:48.664 --> 01:17:50.207
go away.

565
01:17:57.298 --> 01:17:58.924
Do you call that begging?

566
01:18:05.263 --> 01:18:07.682
Beg better than that.

567
01:21:22.038 --> 01:21:23.414
That's what I think ?

568
01:21:23.581 --> 01:21:26.209
You really believed
that it would be so easy?

569
01:21:27.043 --> 01:21:27.919
You know...

570
01:21:28.461 --> 01:21:29.754
a moment, there,

571
01:21:30.630 --> 01:21:33.257
yes, I believed it.

572
01:21:34.884 --> 01:21:36.344
<i> Ugly little bunny. </i>

573
01:21:37.220 --> 01:21:39.013
<i> - Who played the most ...
- ... smart. </i>

574
01:28:08.224 --> 01:28:08.850
Here is

575
01:28:09.017 --> 01:28:10.518
what happens when we're kidding

576
01:28:10.685 --> 01:28:12.520
with the yakuza.

577
01:28:13.188 --> 01:28:14.355
Go back to your mother.

578
01:29:13.454 --> 01:29:16.165
Those who are still alive,

579
01:29:16.332 --> 01:29:19.043
take the opportunity to stay that way,
pull yourself!

580
01:29:20.586 --> 01:29:21.921
Corn...

581
01:29:23.256 --> 01:29:27.343
let the members
that you have lost.

582
01:29:28.427 --> 01:29:31.389
Now they belong to me.

583
01:29:36.768 --> 01:29:38.186
Except you, Sophie!

584
01:29:39.813 --> 01:29:42.524
You don't move.

585
01:30:36.702 --> 01:30:39.205
Very impressive, your instrument.

586
01:30:43.667 --> 01:30:45.085
Where was it made?

587
01:30:47.171 --> 01:30:48.297
In Okinawa.

588
01:30:50.673 --> 01:30:53.551
Who in Okinawa
made you this blade?

589
01:30:55.011 --> 01:30:56.221
Hattori Hanzo.

590
01:30:56.679 --> 01:30:58.181
You lie !

591
01:31:11.277 --> 01:31:13.655
Swords never run out.

592
01:31:14.572 --> 01:31:17.909
I hope you kept
all your energy.

593
01:31:21.704 --> 01:31:22.872
Otherwise...

594
01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:26.917
you won't last five minutes.

595
01:31:29.127 --> 01:31:31.088
As a backdrop to die,

596
01:31:32.422 --> 01:31:34.049
you could have fallen worse.

597
01:34:13.204 --> 01:34:17.542
Poor little white goose who loves
play with samurai swords.

598
01:34:20.044 --> 01:34:22.797
If you don't know how to fight like a samurai,

599
01:34:26.175 --> 01:34:29.052
at least you will die as a samurai.

600
01:34:59.458 --> 01:35:01.001
Attack me

601
01:35:02.169 --> 01:35:03.711
give all you have.

602
01:35:59.015 --> 01:36:01.476
For having ridiculed you earlier,

603
01:36:04.312 --> 01:36:06.231
I'm sorry.

604
01:36:14.906 --> 01:36:16.031
I accept them.

605
01:36:32.673 --> 01:36:33.674
Ready?

606
01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:39.429
Come.

607
01:37:13.087 --> 01:37:14.046
The sword

608
01:37:16.048 --> 01:37:17.758
was really signed

609
01:37:20.303 --> 01:37:21.887
Hattori Hanzo.

610
01:39:28.176 --> 01:39:29.469
Sophie ...

611
01:39:32.305 --> 01:39:33.765
My Sophie ...

612
01:39:34.391 --> 01:39:35.517
I'm sorry.

613
01:39:40.772 --> 01:39:43.066
Sorry for betraying you.

614
01:39:43.233 --> 01:39:44.985
Let's stop talking about it.

615
01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:46.319
However...

616
01:39:47.195 --> 01:39:49.239
Yet nothing ...

617
01:39:51.408 --> 01:39:53.660
if not that my heart bleeds

618
01:39:53.827 --> 01:39:57.788
in front of what she did to my Sophie.

619
01:39:58.873 --> 01:40:01.709
I kept you alive for two reasons.

620
01:40:01.876 --> 01:40:04.211
First of all,
for information.

621
01:40:10.926 --> 01:40:14.054
I'll ask you a few questions.

622
01:40:15.055 --> 01:40:18.559
Every time you don't answer

623
01:40:19.310 --> 01:40:21.228
I'll cut you something.

624
01:40:22.646 --> 01:40:24.440
And believe me

625
01:40:25.065 --> 01:40:27.860
you will miss it.

626
01:40:29.195 --> 01:40:30.321
<i> Give me your arm. </i>

627
01:40:33.948 --> 01:40:38.578
<i> Tell me everything
on the Assassinated Vipers. </i>

628
01:40:38.745 --> 01:40:40.705
If you had to guess ...

629
01:40:40.872 --> 01:40:42.916
why she left you alive ...

630
01:40:44.292 --> 01:40:45.502
what would you say?

631
01:40:48.296 --> 01:40:50.006
No need to guess,

632
01:40:51.216 --> 01:40:52.425
she told me.

633
01:40:55.303 --> 01:40:58.973
She left me my bitch of life
for two reasons.

634
01:41:00.141 --> 01:41:05.271
Like I told you, I leave you
your bitch of life for two reasons.

635
01:41:06.314 --> 01:41:08.023
And the second,

636
01:41:08.816 --> 01:41:11.568
it is for you to report to him,
in person,

637
01:41:11.735 --> 01:41:13.987
everything that happened here tonight.

638
01:41:15.614 --> 01:41:18.826
I want him to measure
the extent of my mercy

639
01:41:18.992 --> 01:41:21.870
seeing what's left of your body.

640
01:41:22.663 --> 01:41:26.416
I want you to tell her
everything you told me.

641
01:41:26.917 --> 01:41:29.461
Let him know what I know.

642
01:41:30.128 --> 01:41:33.590
Let him know that I want him to know.

643
01:41:34.299 --> 01:41:36.677
And let them all know

644
01:41:36.844 --> 01:41:39.054
that they will all soon be

645
01:41:39.263 --> 01:41:42.224
as dead as O-Ren.

646
01:41:57.697 --> 01:42:00.658
LIST OF FIVE TO KILL

647
01:42:06.747 --> 01:42:11.711
<i> Revenge is never
a straight line. </i>

648
01:42:14.589 --> 01:42:16.257
It is a forest.

649
01:42:17.508 --> 01:42:20.468
It is therefore easy to get lost ...

650
01:42:21.636 --> 01:42:24.723
<i> get lost,
forget where we entered. </i>

651
01:42:28.310 --> 01:42:29.227
This woman

652
01:42:30.312 --> 01:42:32.397
deserves his revenge.

653
01:42:37.652 --> 01:42:38.778
And...

654
01:42:39.738 --> 01:42:41.698
we deserve to die.

655
01:42:45.201 --> 01:42:46.494
<i> She must be in pain </i>

656
01:42:46.661 --> 01:42:48.413
until his last breath.

657
01:43:02.134 --> 01:43:03.844
How did you find me

658
01:43:05.095 --> 01:43:06.597
I'm the best.

659
01:43:10.809 --> 01:43:12.770
By the way, Sophie ...

660
01:43:14.355 --> 01:43:18.525
Does she know that her daughter
is still alive?
