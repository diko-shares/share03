1
00:01:22.371 --> 00:01:24.862
Do you find me sadistic?

2
00:01:31.313 --> 00:01:38.276
You know, I bet I could fry
an egg on your head right now.

3
00:01:38.354 --> 00:01:40.584
If I wanted to.

4
00:01:42.057 --> 00:01:44.082
You know, kiddo...

5
00:01:46.395 --> 00:01:52.493
I'd like to believe
you're aware enough, even now,

6
00:01:52.568 --> 00:01:58.871
to know that there's nothing
sadistic in my actions.

7
00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.708
We, maybe towards
those other jokers.

8
00:02:06.348 --> 00:02:08.248
But not you.

9
00:02:11.353 --> 00:02:12.980
No, kiddo.

10
00:02:13.055 --> 00:02:14.989
At this moment...

11
00:02:17.192 --> 00:02:23.722
This is me at my most
masochistic.

12
00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:27.792
Bill, it's your baby.

13
00:05:42.664 --> 00:05:44.632
Coming!

14
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.328
Sarah, I cannot believe
you are early.

15
00:06:50.732 --> 00:06:53.223
What you gonna do now, huh?
What you got?

16
00:06:53.302 --> 00:06:56.100
Got your ass!
Remember that? Huh? Remember?

17
00:07:05.747 --> 00:07:07.840
Okay.
Come on, bitch.

18
00:07:09.184 --> 00:07:11.982
Come on.
Bring it on.

19
00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.788
Mommy, I'm home.

20
00:07:52.861 --> 00:07:54.385
Hey, baby.

21
00:07:54.463 --> 00:07:56.363
How was school?

22
00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.394
Mommy, what happened to you
and the TV room?

23
00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:03.404
Oh.

24
00:08:03.472 --> 00:08:05.963
That good-for-nothing dog
of yours got his ass

25
00:08:06.041 --> 00:08:08.407
in the living room
and acted a damn fool.

26
00:08:08.477 --> 00:08:11.173
- That's what happened, baby.
- Barney did this?

27
00:08:11.246 --> 00:08:13.407
Baby, now, you can't
come in here.

28
00:08:13.482 --> 00:08:17.851
There's broken glass everywhere,
and you could cut yourself.

29
00:08:23.158 --> 00:08:26.924
This is an old friend of mommy's
I ain't seen in a long time.

30
00:08:26.995 --> 00:08:28.963
Hi, honey.

31
00:08:29.031 --> 00:08:30.760
I'm ****

32
00:08:30.832 --> 00:08:31.992
What's your name?

33
00:08:35.604 --> 00:08:37.765
Her name is Nikki.

34
00:08:37.839 --> 00:08:39.431
Nikki.

35
00:08:40.275 --> 00:08:43.142
Such a pretty name
for such a pretty girl.

36
00:08:44.946 --> 00:08:46.607
How old are you, Nikki?

37
00:08:49.017 --> 00:08:53.954
Nikki, **** asked you
a question.

38
00:08:54.022 --> 00:08:56.081
I'm 4.

39
00:08:56.158 --> 00:08:58.353
4 years old, eh?

40
00:08:59.027 --> 00:09:03.430
You know,
I had a little girl once.

41
00:09:04.132 --> 00:09:06.726
She'd be about 4 now.

42
00:09:09.671 --> 00:09:13.539
Now, baby, me and mommy's friend
got some grown-up talk

43
00:09:13.608 --> 00:09:14.905
to talk about.

44
00:09:14.976 --> 00:09:16.068
You can go in your room.

45
00:09:16.144 --> 00:09:19.079
And I want you to leave us alone
till I tell you to come out.

46
00:09:19.147 --> 00:09:20.580
Okay?

47
00:09:22.117 --> 00:09:24.085
Nikkia!

48
00:09:24.152 --> 00:09:26.950
In your room.
Now.

49
00:09:39.501 --> 00:09:41.765
You want some coffee?

50
00:09:41.837 --> 00:09:43.998
Yeah. Sure.

51
00:09:51.012 --> 00:09:52.775
<i>This Pasadena homemaker's name</i>

52
00:09:52.848 --> 00:09:53.940
<i>Is Jeanne Bell.</i>

53
00:09:54.015 --> 00:09:56.609
<i>Her husband is
Dr. Lawrence Bell.</i>

54
00:09:56.685 --> 00:09:59.449
<i>But back when we were
acquainted, Four years ago,</i>

55
00:09:59.521 --> 00:10:01.614
<i>her nanne was Vernita Green.</i>

56
00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:04.284
<i>Her code name was Copperhead.</i>

57
00:10:04.359 --> 00:10:06.156
<i>Mine, Black Mamba.</i>

58
00:10:06.228 --> 00:10:07.786
Do you have a towel?

59
00:10:09.131 --> 00:10:10.621
Yeah.

60
00:10:13.869 --> 00:10:15.097
Thanks.

61
00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:17.229
You still take cream and sugar?

62
00:10:17.305 --> 00:10:18.272
Yeah.

63
00:10:21.376 --> 00:10:24.106
So suppose it's a little late
for an apology.

64
00:10:24.179 --> 00:10:26.545
You suppose correctly.

65
00:10:26.615 --> 00:10:28.810
Look, bitch, I need to know

66
00:10:28.884 --> 00:10:31.648
if you're gonna start more shit
around my baby girl.

67
00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.745
You can relax for now.

68
00:10:35.056 --> 00:10:38.583
I'm not gonna murder you
in front of your child, okay?

69
00:10:40.061 --> 00:10:41.255
That's being more rational

70
00:10:41.329 --> 00:10:43.661
than Bill led me to believe
you were capable of.

71
00:10:43.732 --> 00:10:48.101
It's mercy, compassion,
and forgiveness I lack.

72
00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:50.138
Not rationality.

73
00:10:54.776 --> 00:10:56.209
Look.

74
00:10:56.278 --> 00:10:59.770
I know I fucked you over.
I fucked you over bad.

75
00:10:59.848 --> 00:11:02.339
I wish to God I hadn't,
but I did.

76
00:11:03.351 --> 00:11:05.376
You have every right
to want to get even.

77
00:11:05.454 --> 00:11:07.945
No, no, no, no, no.

78
00:11:08.023 --> 00:11:09.081
No.

79
00:11:09.157 --> 00:11:12.957
To get even, even Stephen,

80
00:11:13.028 --> 00:11:19.456
would have to kill you,
go up to Nikki's room, kill her,

81
00:11:19.534 --> 00:11:24.301
then wait for your husband
to come home and kill him.

82
00:11:24.372 --> 00:11:26.738
That would be even, Vernita.

83
00:11:26.808 --> 00:11:28.935
That'd be about square.

84
00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:32.070
Look, if I could go back
in a machine, I would.

85
00:11:32.147 --> 00:11:33.808
But I can't.

86
00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:38.019
All I can tell you is that I'm
a different person now.

87
00:11:38.086 --> 00:11:42.045
Oh, great.
I don't care.

88
00:11:42.123 --> 00:11:43.988
Be that as it may,

89
00:11:44.059 --> 00:11:47.085
I know I don't deserve
your mercy or your forgiveness.

90
00:11:47.162 --> 00:11:51.792
However, I beseech you for both
on behalf of my daughter.

91
00:11:51.867 --> 00:11:55.633
Bitch, you can stop right there.

92
00:11:56.371 --> 00:11:58.271
Just because I have no wish
to murder you

93
00:11:58.340 --> 00:11:59.671
before the eyes of your daughter

94
00:11:59.741 --> 00:12:02.301
does not mean that parading her
around in front of me

95
00:12:02.377 --> 00:12:05.437
is gonna inspire sympathy.

96
00:12:05.514 --> 00:12:08.483
You and I have
unfinished business.

97
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:10.711
And not a goddamn fucking thing
you've done

98
00:12:10.785 --> 00:12:12.275
in the subsequent four years,

99
00:12:12.354 --> 00:12:16.552
including getting knocked up,
is gonna change that.

100
00:12:17.526 --> 00:12:20.051
So when do we do this?

101
00:12:20.128 --> 00:12:22.289
It all depends.

102
00:12:22.364 --> 00:12:24.958
When do you want to die?

103
00:12:25.033 --> 00:12:27.900
Tomorrow?
The day after tomorrow?

104
00:12:27.969 --> 00:12:29.231
How about tonight, bitch?

105
00:12:29.304 --> 00:12:31.636
Splendid.
Where?

106
00:12:31.706 --> 00:12:33.970
There's a baseball diamond
where I coach our little league

107
00:12:34.042 --> 00:12:35.976
about a mile from here.

108
00:12:36.044 --> 00:12:38.035
We meet there around 2:30
in the morning,

109
00:12:38.113 --> 00:12:42.140
dressed all in black,
your hair in a back stocking.

110
00:12:42.217 --> 00:12:45.050
And we have us a knife fight.

111
00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.145
We won't be bothered.

112
00:12:47.222 --> 00:12:52.125
Now, I have to fix
Nikki's cereal.

113
00:13:00.735 --> 00:13:03.033
Bill said you were one
of the best ladies he saw

114
00:13:03.104 --> 00:13:04.537
with an edged weapon.

115
00:13:04.606 --> 00:13:06.767
Fuck you, bitch.

116
00:13:06.841 --> 00:13:09.207
I know he didn't qualify
that shit.

117
00:13:09.277 --> 00:13:13.077
So you can just kiss my
motherfucking ass, Black Mamba.

118
00:13:13.882 --> 00:13:16.043
Black Mamba.

119
00:13:16.117 --> 00:13:18.813
I should have been
motherfucking Black Mamba.

120
00:13:18.887 --> 00:13:19.876
Weapon of choice?

121
00:13:19.955 --> 00:13:22.685
If you want to stick with your
butcher knife, that's fine.

122
00:13:24.459 --> 00:13:26.893
Very funny, bitch.

123
00:13:26.962 --> 00:13:28.725
Very funny!

124
00:14:26.287 --> 00:14:29.381
It was not my intention
to do this in front of you.

125
00:14:31.693 --> 00:14:33.684
For that, I'm sorry.

126
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:37.260
But you can take my word for it.

127
00:14:40.301 --> 00:14:42.826
Your mother had it coming.

128
00:14:57.519 --> 00:15:04.015
When you grow up, if you still
feel raw about it...

129
00:15:07.829 --> 00:15:09.592
I'll be waiting.

130
00:15:13.702 --> 00:15:16.330
For those regarded as warriors...

131
00:15:16.771 --> 00:15:19.069
When engaged in combat...

132
00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:24.234
the vanquishing of thine enemy can be
the warrior's only concern.

133
00:15:26.748 --> 00:15:31.811
Suppress a human emotion and compassion...

134
00:15:36.891 --> 00:15:43.421
...kill whoever stands in thy way, even if that be
Lord God, or Buddha himself.

135
00:15:49.738 --> 00:15:55.438
This truth lies at the heart of the art of combat.

136
00:16:20.668 --> 00:16:22.499
Come on out to Dallas.

137
00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:26.267
This is Rockabilly Rhythms
on KTRN, Wichita Falls.

138
00:16:26.341 --> 00:16:28.605
And next, we got some record.

139
00:16:28.676 --> 00:16:31.440
Very own wildman,
Charlie Feathers.

140
00:17:07.148 --> 00:17:12.085
Well, give me the gory details,
Son Number One.

141
00:17:12.153 --> 00:17:14.519
It's a goddamn massacre, Pop.

142
00:17:16.157 --> 00:17:19.752
They wiped out the whole
wedding party, execution style.

143
00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:23.363
Give me a figure.

144
00:17:23.431 --> 00:17:25.422
Nine dead bodies.

145
00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:28.094
And we're talking
the whole shebang.

146
00:17:28.169 --> 00:17:31.104
Bride. Groom.

147
00:17:31.172 --> 00:17:32.867
Reverend.

148
00:17:32.941 --> 00:17:35.603
Reverend's wife.

149
00:17:35.677 --> 00:17:39.704
They even shot that old colored
fella that plays the organ.

150
00:17:39.781 --> 00:17:42.045
It would appear
somebody objected to this

151
00:17:42.116 --> 00:17:44.448
and wasn't able to hold
their peace.

152
00:17:49.023 --> 00:17:52.925
Good gravy, Marie.

153
00:17:58.633 --> 00:17:59.895
What'd I tell you, Pop?

154
00:17:59.968 --> 00:18:03.233
It's like a goddamn
Nicaraguan death squad.

155
00:18:03.304 --> 00:18:06.068
You better shit-can
that blasphemy, boy.

156
00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:07.664
You're in a house of worship.

157
00:18:07.742 --> 00:18:09.175
Sorry, Pop.

158
00:18:11.246 --> 00:18:13.976
Well, this is definitely
the work of professionals.

159
00:18:14.048 --> 00:18:18.917
I'd guesstimate
Mexican Mafia hit squad.

160
00:18:18.987 --> 00:18:21.581
Four, maybe five strong.

161
00:18:21.656 --> 00:18:23.681
How can you tell?

162
00:18:23.758 --> 00:18:26.750
Well, a sure and steady hand
did this.

163
00:18:27.762 --> 00:18:30.595
This ain't no
squirrey amateur.

164
00:18:30.665 --> 00:18:34.192
This is the work of a salty dog.

165
00:18:34.269 --> 00:18:36.999
You can tell by the cleanliness
of the carnage.

166
00:18:37.071 --> 00:18:40.370
Now, a kill-crazy rampage,
though it may be,

167
00:18:40.441 --> 00:18:43.706
all the colors are kept
inside the lines.

168
00:18:43.778 --> 00:18:47.714
If you was a moron,
you could almost admire it.

169
00:18:59.627 --> 00:19:01.720
Who's the bride?

170
00:19:01.796 --> 00:19:03.286
I don't know.

171
00:19:03.364 --> 00:19:04.888
The name
on the marriage certificate

172
00:19:04.966 --> 00:19:07.992
is Arlene Machiavelli.

173
00:19:08.069 --> 00:19:09.900
That's a fake.

174
00:19:09.971 --> 00:19:11.666
We've been calling her
"The Bride"

175
00:19:11.739 --> 00:19:13.229
on account of the dress.

176
00:19:13.308 --> 00:19:16.072
You can tell she was pregnant.

177
00:19:16.144 --> 00:19:17.736
Man would have to be a mad dog

178
00:19:17.812 --> 00:19:21.714
to shoot a goddamn good-looking
gal like that in the head.

179
00:19:23.818 --> 00:19:25.308
Look at her.

180
00:19:27.655 --> 00:19:32.592
Hay-colored hair.
Big eyes.

181
00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:35.390
She's a little
blood-splattered angel.

182
00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:40.761
Son Number One?

183
00:19:40.835 --> 00:19:42.097
Yeah?

184
00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:46.698
This tall drink of cocksucker
ain't dead.

185
00:22:21.596 --> 00:22:24.429
I might never have liked you.

186
00:22:25.566 --> 00:22:28.626
Point in fact, I despise you.

187
00:22:30.037 --> 00:22:34.235
But that shouldn't suggest
that I don't respect you.

188
00:22:37.378 --> 00:22:40.472
Dying in our sleep is a luxury

189
00:22:40.548 --> 00:22:43.813
that our kind
is rarely afforded.

190
00:22:43.885 --> 00:22:47.616
My gift to you.

191
00:22:53.728 --> 00:22:55.662
For fuck's sake.

192
00:22:59.233 --> 00:23:00.427
Hello, Bill.

193
00:23:02.336 --> 00:23:04.133
What's her condition?

194
00:23:04.205 --> 00:23:06.400
Comatose.

195
00:23:07.175 --> 00:23:08.699
Where is she?

196
00:23:08.776 --> 00:23:12.041
I'm standing over her right now.

197
00:23:12.113 --> 00:23:14.206
That's my girl.

198
00:23:16.851 --> 00:23:19.684
Elle, you're going to abort
the mission.

199
00:23:19.754 --> 00:23:20.880
What?

200
00:23:20.955 --> 00:23:22.479
We owe her better than that.

201
00:23:22.557 --> 00:23:24.320
Oh, you don't owe her shit!

202
00:23:24.392 --> 00:23:26.053
Will you keep your voice down?

203
00:23:26.127 --> 00:23:27.992
You don't owe her shit!

204
00:23:28.062 --> 00:23:30.155
May I say one thing?

205
00:23:30.231 --> 00:23:32.062
Speak.

206
00:23:33.367 --> 00:23:35.164
Y'all beat the hell
out of that woman.

207
00:23:35.236 --> 00:23:37.170
But you didn't kill her.

208
00:23:37.238 --> 00:23:39.069
And I put a bullet in her head.

209
00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:42.473
But her heart
just kept on beating.

210
00:23:42.543 --> 00:23:43.976
Now, you saw that yourself

211
00:23:44.045 --> 00:23:48.948
with your own beautiful
blue eye, did you not?

212
00:23:49.884 --> 00:23:53.445
We've done a lot of things
to this lady.

213
00:23:53.521 --> 00:23:58.982
And if she ever wakes up,
we'll do a whole lot more.

214
00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:00.994
But one thing we won't do

215
00:24:01.062 --> 00:24:05.431
is sneak into her room
in the night like a filthy rat

216
00:24:05.499 --> 00:24:09.435
and kill her in her sleep.

217
00:24:09.503 --> 00:24:12.131
And the reason
we won't do that thing

218
00:24:12.206 --> 00:24:17.439
is because that thing
would lower us.

219
00:24:17.511 --> 00:24:19.536
Don't you agree, Miss Driver?

220
00:24:21.515 --> 00:24:22.812
I guess.

221
00:24:22.883 --> 00:24:25.374
Do you really have to guess?

222
00:24:25.453 --> 00:24:27.444
No.

223
00:24:27.521 --> 00:24:31.457
I don't really have to guess.
I know.

224
00:24:32.693 --> 00:24:34.991
Come on home, honey.

225
00:24:36.364 --> 00:24:38.355
Affirmative.

226
00:24:39.634 --> 00:24:41.795
I love you very much.

227
00:24:41.869 --> 00:24:44.030
I love you, too.

228
00:24:46.807 --> 00:24:48.365
Bye-bye.

229
00:24:59.654 --> 00:25:02.179
Thought that was pretty
fucking funny, didn't you?

230
00:25:02.256 --> 00:25:03.746
Hmm?

231
00:25:05.326 --> 00:25:08.420
Word of advice, shithead.

232
00:25:08.496 --> 00:25:11.522
Don't you ever wake up.

233
00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:53.103
At this moment, this is me
at my most masochistic.

234
00:25:53.174 --> 00:25:56.268
Bill, it's your baby.

235
00:26:58.305 --> 00:27:01.604
Oh, my baby.

236
00:27:27.201 --> 00:27:31.228
Four years.

237
00:28:00.801 --> 00:28:03.395
The price is $75 a fuck,
my friend.

238
00:28:03.471 --> 00:28:04.995
You getting your freak on
or what?

239
00:28:05.072 --> 00:28:07.199
Oh, yeah, boy.

240
00:28:11.412 --> 00:28:13.539
20, 40, 60, 75.

241
00:28:13.614 --> 00:28:15.582
Yeah.
Now, here's the rules.

242
00:28:15.649 --> 00:28:17.276
Rule number one.

243
00:28:17.351 --> 00:28:18.409
No punching her.

244
00:28:18.486 --> 00:28:20.249
Nurse comes in
and she got a shiner

245
00:28:20.321 --> 00:28:22.084
or less some teeth, jig's up.

246
00:28:22.156 --> 00:28:24.647
So no knuckle sandwiches
under no circumstances.

247
00:28:24.725 --> 00:28:26.488
And by the way,
this cunt's a spitter.

248
00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:30.087
It's a motor-reflex thing.
But spit or no, no punching.

249
00:28:30.164 --> 00:28:33.133
- Now, are we clear on rule one?
- Yeah.

250
00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:36.431
Good. Now, rule number two.
No monkey bites, no hickeys.

251
00:28:36.504 --> 00:28:39.200
In fact, no leaving no marks
of no kind.

252
00:28:39.273 --> 00:28:42.470
After that,
it's all good, buddy.

253
00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:44.637
Now, her plumbing down there
don't work.

254
00:28:44.712 --> 00:28:46.202
So feel free to come in her
all you want.

255
00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:47.872
Keep the noise down.
Try not to make a mess.

256
00:28:47.948 --> 00:28:49.540
I'll Be back in 20.

257
00:28:50.818 --> 00:28:52.445
Yeah.

258
00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:54.454
Oh, shit.

259
00:28:54.522 --> 00:28:57.082
By the way, not all the time,
but sometimes

260
00:28:57.157 --> 00:28:59.648
this chick's cooch can get
drier than a bucket of sand.

261
00:28:59.727 --> 00:29:03.128
If she dry, lube up with this
and you'll be good to go.

262
00:29:04.131 --> 00:29:06.258
<i>Bon appetit, good buddy.</i>

263
00:29:15.309 --> 00:29:18.745
Oh, yeah.

264
00:29:20.247 --> 00:29:21.179
Oh, God damn.

265
00:29:21.248 --> 00:29:24.809
You are the best-looking girl
I've had today.

266
00:29:45.506 --> 00:29:46.837
Oh.

267
00:30:12.967 --> 00:30:15.367
Yo, stud!
Time's up, buddy.

268
00:30:15.436 --> 00:30:17.199
Coming in, ready or not.

269
00:30:17.271 --> 00:30:19.933
Hey, buddy, did you have
yourself a good time?

270
00:30:21.241 --> 00:30:22.765
Whoa.

271
00:30:41.128 --> 00:30:42.755
Aaaah!

272
00:30:52.473 --> 00:30:54.031
Where's Bill?

273
00:30:54.642 --> 00:30:56.735
Where's Bill?

274
00:30:58.012 --> 00:30:59.206
Please stop hitting me.

275
00:30:59.279 --> 00:31:00.405
Where's Bill?

276
00:31:02.082 --> 00:31:03.572
I don't know who Bill is!

277
00:31:03.651 --> 00:31:05.118
Bullshit!

278
00:31:13.027 --> 00:31:16.724
Well, ain't you the slice
of cutie pie they said you was?

279
00:31:16.797 --> 00:31:20.130
Jane Doe, huh? We don't know
shit about you, do we?

280
00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:21.929
I'm from Huntsville, Texas.

281
00:31:22.002 --> 00:31:26.302
My name is Buck,
and I'm here to fuck.

282
00:31:29.376 --> 00:31:32.072
Your name is Buck.

283
00:31:32.146 --> 00:31:33.977
Right?

284
00:31:34.048 --> 00:31:37.142
And you came here to fuck.

285
00:31:37.217 --> 00:31:38.377
Right?

286
00:31:38.452 --> 00:31:40.044
Wait a minute.
Wait.

287
00:32:05.946 --> 00:32:07.937
"Pussy Wagon. "

288
00:32:08.015 --> 00:32:09.949
You fucker.

289
00:32:37.111 --> 00:32:40.103
Texas. Okay.

290
00:34:25.853 --> 00:34:28.481
Wiggle your big toe.

291
00:34:32.793 --> 00:34:35.091
Wiggle your big toe.

292
00:34:43.136 --> 00:34:45.627
Wiggle your big toe.

293
00:34:51.211 --> 00:34:53.406
Wiggle your big toe.

294
00:34:58.218 --> 00:34:59.913
Wiggle your big toe.

295
00:34:59.987 --> 00:35:02.387
<i>As I lay in the back
of Buck's truck,</i>

296
00:35:02.456 --> 00:35:04.981
<i>trying to will my limbs
out of entropy...</i>

297
00:35:05.058 --> 00:35:06.685
Wiggle your big toe.

298
00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:10.821
<i>...I could see the faces of
the cunts who did this to me.</i>

299
00:35:10.898 --> 00:35:13.799
<i>And the dicks responsible.</i>

300
00:35:15.102 --> 00:35:20.904
<i>Members all of the Deadly Viper
Assassination Squad.</i>

301
00:35:22.843 --> 00:35:24.504
<i>When fortune smiles
on something</i>

302
00:35:24.578 --> 00:35:27.046
<i>as violent and ugly as revenge,</i>

303
00:35:27.114 --> 00:35:31.107
<i>It seems proof like no other
that not only does God exist,</i>

304
00:35:31.184 --> 00:35:33.209
<i>you're doing his will.</i>

305
00:35:33.287 --> 00:35:35.881
<i>At a time when I knew the least
about my enemies,</i>

306
00:35:35.956 --> 00:35:37.947
<i>the first name
on my death list,</i>

307
00:35:38.025 --> 00:35:41.961
<i>O- Ren Ishii,
was the easiest to find.</i>

308
00:35:42.029 --> 00:35:44.463
<i>But when one
manages the difficult task</i>

309
00:35:44.531 --> 00:35:47.227
<i>of becoming queen
of the Tokyo underworld,</i>

310
00:35:47.301 --> 00:35:50.532
<i>one doesn't keep it a secret,
does one?</i>

311
00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:07.245
<i>O- Ren Ishii was born
on an American military base</i>

312
00:36:07.321 --> 00:36:09.687
<i>In Tokyo, Japan.</i>

313
00:36:09.756 --> 00:36:13.214
<i>The half-Japanese, half-Chinese
American Army brat</i>

314
00:36:13.293 --> 00:36:16.854
<i>made her first acquaintance
with death at the age of 9.</i>

315
00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:18.761
<i>It was at that age
she witnessed</i>

316
00:36:18.832 --> 00:36:20.629
<i>the death of her parents
at the hands</i>

317
00:36:20.701 --> 00:36:26.537
<i>of Japan's most ruthless
yakuza boss, Boss Matsumoto.</i>

318
00:36:53.433 --> 00:36:54.900
Hyah!

319
00:37:33.673 --> 00:37:34.799
Hmm.

320
00:38:43.844 --> 00:38:45.209
Hmm.

321
00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:22.005
Oh.

322
00:39:41.768 --> 00:39:42.928
Mommy.

323
00:40:52.572 --> 00:40:55.040
<i>She swore revenge.</i>

324
00:40:55.108 --> 00:41:00.273
<i>Luckily for her,
Boss Matsumoto was a pedophile.</i>

325
00:41:02.182 --> 00:41:06.312
<i>At 11, she got her revenge.</i>

326
00:41:09.222 --> 00:41:12.988
Look at me, Matsumoto...

327
00:41:14.661 --> 00:41:17.755
...take a good look at my face.

328
00:41:19.699 --> 00:41:21.724
Look at my eyes.

329
00:41:24.738 --> 00:41:26.933
Look at my mouth.

330
00:41:28.008 --> 00:41:29.942
Do I look familiar?

331
00:41:32.245 --> 00:41:34.338
Do I look like somebody...

332
00:41:34.414 --> 00:41:36.575
you murdered?!

333
00:42:49.389 --> 00:42:54.326
<i>By 20, she was one of the top
female assassins in the world.</i>

334
00:43:41.875 --> 00:43:44.503
<i>At 25, she did her part
in the killing</i>

335
00:43:44.577 --> 00:43:49.742
<i>of nine innocent people,
Including my unborn daughter,</i>

336
00:43:49.816 --> 00:43:54.150
<i>In a small wedding chapel
In El Paso, Texas.</i>

337
00:43:54.220 --> 00:44:01.922
<i>But on that day four years ago
she made one big mistake.</i>

338
00:44:01.995 --> 00:44:04.520
<i>She should have killed 10.</i>

339
00:44:05.198 --> 00:44:09.601
<i>However, before satisfaction
would be mine,</i>

340
00:44:09.669 --> 00:44:11.694
<i>first things first.</i>

341
00:44:11.771 --> 00:44:14.706
Wiggle your big toe.

342
00:44:21.614 --> 00:44:24.048
Hard part's over.

343
00:44:24.117 --> 00:44:27.883
Now, let's get
these other piggies wiggling.

344
00:45:02.422 --> 00:45:04.515
Welcome to Air O.
May I help you?

345
00:45:04.591 --> 00:45:06.889
Okinawa.
One-way.

346
00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:35.385
Hi.

347
00:45:35.455 --> 00:45:37.355
Welcome...

348
00:45:42.061 --> 00:45:43.961
Welcome.

349
00:45:44.797 --> 00:45:46.765
You English?

350
00:45:46.833 --> 00:45:49.131
Almost.
American.

351
00:45:49.202 --> 00:45:52.968
American.
Welcome, American.

352
00:45:53.039 --> 00:45:54.336
<i>Domo.</i>

353
00:45:54.407 --> 00:45:57.240
My English very good.

354
00:45:57.310 --> 00:46:00.575
<i>You said "domo."
Can you speak Japanese?</i>

355
00:46:00.647 --> 00:46:01.579
No, no.

356
00:46:01.648 --> 00:46:04.583
Just a few words learned
since yesterday.

357
00:46:04.651 --> 00:46:07.211
Um, may I sit at the bar?

358
00:46:07.287 --> 00:46:10.654
Oh, sure, sure, sure.
Please sit.

359
00:46:11.491 --> 00:46:13.686
Oh.

360
00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:16.593
What other words did you learn?

361
00:46:16.663 --> 00:46:18.756
Oh, just a minute.

362
00:46:18.831 --> 00:46:23.131
We have a customer.
Bring out some tea, quickly.

363
00:46:23.403 --> 00:46:26.372
I'm watching my soap operas.

364
00:46:27.507 --> 00:46:29.498
Lazy bastard...

365
00:46:29.876 --> 00:46:31.935
Screw your soap opera... hurry up!

366
00:46:32.011 --> 00:46:33.706
The tea's hot.

367
00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:35.509
Why don't you serve it yourself for once?

368
00:46:35.582 --> 00:46:36.947
Shut up!

369
00:46:37.016 --> 00:46:39.951
Get your ass out here!

370
00:46:40.019 --> 00:46:41.987
Uh, excuse me.

371
00:46:44.057 --> 00:46:47.458
Uh, what other Japanese
do you know?

372
00:46:47.527 --> 00:46:48.459
Oh, let's see.

373
00:46:48.528 --> 00:46:50.655
<i>Um, "arigato."</i>

374
00:46:50.730 --> 00:46:53.198
<i>"Arigato."
Good!</i>

375
00:46:53.266 --> 00:46:57.396
<i>Um, already said "donno,"
right?</i>

376
00:46:57.470 --> 00:46:59.904
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

377
00:46:59.973 --> 00:47:01.031
"Konn-itch-iwa."

378
00:47:01.107 --> 00:47:02.836
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

379
00:47:02.909 --> 00:47:04.672
"Kohn-nee-chee-wah."

380
00:47:04.744 --> 00:47:06.405
<i>Konnichi wa.
Pease repeat.</i>

381
00:47:06.479 --> 00:47:07.639
<i>Konnichi wa.</i>

382
00:47:07.714 --> 00:47:08.738
Perfect.

383
00:47:08.815 --> 00:47:10.840
Good, good, good.

384
00:47:10.917 --> 00:47:13.442
You say Japanese word
like you Japanese.

385
00:47:13.519 --> 00:47:15.009
Oh, you're making fun of me!

386
00:47:15.088 --> 00:47:18.080
No, no, no, no.
Serious business.

387
00:47:18.157 --> 00:47:21.285
Pronounciation very good.

388
00:47:21.361 --> 00:47:25.957
<i>You say arigato
like we say arigato.</i>

389
00:47:28.668 --> 00:47:32.195
<i>Well, thank you.
I mean, arigato.</i>

390
00:47:32.271 --> 00:47:33.670
Mmm-hmm.

391
00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:36.265
You should learn Japanese.

392
00:47:36.342 --> 00:47:38.276
Very easy.

393
00:47:38.344 --> 00:47:40.312
No kidding.
I heard it was kind of hard.

394
00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:42.541
Most difficult.

395
00:47:42.615 --> 00:47:45.516
But you have Japanese tongue.

396
00:47:47.854 --> 00:47:49.412
Okay, okay.

397
00:47:52.025 --> 00:47:56.359
Oh.
Oh, my God.

398
00:47:56.429 --> 00:48:02.265
Hey, what the hell happened to the tea?
Hurry up... goddammit!

399
00:48:05.571 --> 00:48:10.304
Lazy oaf...

400
00:48:14.847 --> 00:48:16.906
What d'ya want?

401
00:48:17.316 --> 00:48:18.908
Beg your pardon?

402
00:48:18.985 --> 00:48:22.250
Uh, drink.

403
00:48:22.321 --> 00:48:23.583
Oh, yes.

404
00:48:23.656 --> 00:48:26.090
A bottle of warm sake, please.

405
00:48:26.159 --> 00:48:27.751
Warm sake?

406
00:48:27.827 --> 00:48:29.920
Very good!

407
00:48:29.996 --> 00:48:31.463
One warm sake!

408
00:48:31.531 --> 00:48:34.694
Sake? In the middle of the day?

409
00:48:35.168 --> 00:48:39.468
- Day, night, afternoon -
Who gives a damn- Get the sake!

410
00:48:39.539 --> 00:48:42.440
How come I always have to get the sake?

411
00:48:42.508 --> 00:48:43.600
You listen we...

412
00:48:44.110 --> 00:48:47.409
For thirty years, you make the fish,
I get the sake.

413
00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:49.277
If this were the military,

414
00:48:49.348 --> 00:48:53.079
I'd be General by now.

415
00:48:53.152 --> 00:48:55.916
Oh, so you'd be General, huh?

416
00:48:55.988 --> 00:48:59.890
If you were General, I'd be emperor,

417
00:48:59.959 --> 00:49:02.393
and you'd still get the sake -

418
00:49:02.462 --> 00:49:04.657
and you'd still get the sake -
So shut up and get the sake.

419
00:49:04.731 --> 00:49:05.789
Do you understand?

420
00:49:05.865 --> 00:49:07.799
I'm not bad, okay? I shaved my head.

421
00:49:07.867 --> 00:49:09.835
Do you understand me?

422
00:49:13.139 --> 00:49:14.766
Sorry.

423
00:49:17.143 --> 00:49:20.010
Oh! Oh, oh.
First time in Japan?

424
00:49:20.079 --> 00:49:21.512
- Uh-huh.
- Oh.

425
00:49:21.581 --> 00:49:24.778
What brings you to Okinawa?

426
00:49:24.851 --> 00:49:26.648
Came to see a man.

427
00:49:26.719 --> 00:49:29.415
Oh, yeah.

428
00:49:29.489 --> 00:49:32.253
You have a friend
live in Okinawa?

429
00:49:32.325 --> 00:49:33.917
Not quite.

430
00:49:33.993 --> 00:49:35.858
Not friend?

431
00:49:35.928 --> 00:49:37.327
Never met him.

432
00:49:37.396 --> 00:49:39.364
Never?

433
00:49:39.432 --> 00:49:41.195
Who is he?

434
00:49:41.267 --> 00:49:42.962
May I ask?

435
00:49:44.103 --> 00:49:46.867
Hattori Hanzo.

436
00:49:58.785 --> 00:50:01.549
What do you want with Hattori Hanzo?

437
00:50:02.889 --> 00:50:05.585
I need Japanese steel.

438
00:50:08.294 --> 00:50:10.762
Why do you need Japanese steel?

439
00:50:12.698 --> 00:50:15.258
I have vermin to kill.

440
00:50:18.638 --> 00:50:24.406
You must have big rats,
you need Hattori Hanzo's steel.

441
00:50:26.879 --> 00:50:28.870
Huge.

442
00:51:56.569 --> 00:51:58.662
May I?

443
00:51:58.738 --> 00:52:00.467
You may.

444
00:52:03.342 --> 00:52:04.832
Wait.

445
00:52:04.911 --> 00:52:07.436
Try the second one down.

446
00:53:00.399 --> 00:53:02.424
Funny.

447
00:53:02.501 --> 00:53:04.867
You like samurai swords.

448
00:53:07.673 --> 00:53:10.369
I like baseball.

449
00:53:18.317 --> 00:53:20.842
I wanted to show you these.

450
00:53:22.154 --> 00:53:22.916
However...

451
00:53:24.090 --> 00:53:27.355
...someone as you, who knows so much, must
surely know...

452
00:53:28.094 --> 00:53:32.895
...I no longer make instruments of death.

453
00:53:34.266 --> 00:53:35.824
What I have here...

454
00:53:36.902 --> 00:53:42.397
...I keep for their aesthetic and sentimental value.

455
00:53:43.843 --> 00:53:47.574
Yet proud as I am of my life's work...

456
00:53:52.685 --> 00:53:55.950
...I have retired.

457
00:54:03.996 --> 00:54:06.089
Then give me one of these.

458
00:54:06.165 --> 00:54:08.497
These are not for sale.

459
00:54:09.935 --> 00:54:12.369
I didn't say "sell me."

460
00:54:12.438 --> 00:54:14.065
I said "give me."

461
00:54:16.342 --> 00:54:19.436
Why should I help you?

462
00:54:19.512 --> 00:54:24.711
Because my vermin
is a former student of yours.

463
00:54:27.019 --> 00:54:30.455
And considering the student,

464
00:54:30.523 --> 00:54:35.620
I'd say you have
a rather large obligation.

465
00:55:32.118 --> 00:55:33.813
You can sleep here.

466
00:55:34.787 --> 00:55:36.982
It will take me a month...

467
00:55:39.658 --> 00:55:41.057
...to make the sword.

468
00:55:42.461 --> 00:55:45.191
I suggest you spend it practicing.

469
00:57:13.619 --> 00:57:15.553
I've completed doing...

470
00:57:17.556 --> 00:57:21.219
...what I swore an oath to God, 28 years ago,

471
00:57:23.562 --> 00:57:27.225
...to never do again.

472
00:57:29.935 --> 00:57:33.837
I have created "something that kills people."

473
00:57:35.574 --> 00:57:41.308
And in that purpose, was a success.

474
00:57:44.416 --> 00:57:46.475
I've done this because philosophically,

475
00:57:47.286 --> 00:57:53.247
I am sympathetic to your aim.

476
00:57:55.995 --> 00:58:01.934
I can tell you with no ego, this is my finest sword.

477
00:58:03.102 --> 00:58:06.560
If on your journey, you should encounter God...

478
00:58:06.639 --> 00:58:09.802
...God will be cut.

479
00:58:22.354 --> 00:58:24.618
Yellow-haired warrior...

480
00:58:24.890 --> 00:58:27.085
Go.

481
00:58:27.159 --> 00:58:28.717
<i>Domo.</i>

482
00:58:50.282 --> 00:58:54.048
<i>It was one year after
the massacre in El Paso, Texas,</i>

483
00:58:54.119 --> 00:58:56.087
<i>that Bill backed
his Nippon progeny</i>

484
00:58:56.155 --> 00:58:58.214
<i>financially
and philosophically in her</i>

485
00:58:58.290 --> 00:59:00.622
<i>Shakespearean-in-magnitude
power struggle</i>

486
00:59:00.693 --> 00:59:02.160
<i>with the other yakuza clans</i>

487
00:59:02.227 --> 00:59:06.493
<i>over who would rule vice
in the city of Tokyo.</i>

488
00:59:06.565 --> 00:59:08.590
<i>When the final sword
was sheathed,</i>

489
00:59:08.667 --> 00:59:11.830
<i>It was O-Ren Ishii
and her powerful posse...</i>

490
00:59:13.038 --> 00:59:16.838
<i>...the Crazy 88,
that proved the victor.</i>

491
00:59:18.977 --> 00:59:20.911
<i>The pretty lady
to O-Ren's right,</i>

492
00:59:20.979 --> 00:59:23.675
<i>who's dressed like
she's a villain on "Star Trek,"</i>

493
00:59:23.749 --> 00:59:27.685
<i>is O-Ren's lawyer, best friend,
and second lieutenant.</i>

494
00:59:27.753 --> 00:59:31.917
<i>The half-French,
half-Japanese Sofie Fatale.</i>

495
00:59:31.990 --> 00:59:35.221
<i>Another former protégée
of Bill's.</i>

496
00:59:37.663 --> 00:59:39.858
<i>The young girl
in the school-girl uniform</i>

497
00:59:39.932 --> 00:59:45.427
<i>is O-Ren's personal bodyguard,
17-year-old Gogo Yubari.</i>

498
00:59:45.504 --> 00:59:48.735
<i>Gogo may be young,
but what she lacks in age,</i>

499
00:59:48.807 --> 00:59:51.537
<i>she makes up for in madness.</i>

500
00:59:51.610 --> 00:59:53.305
Do you like Ferraris?

501
00:59:57.383 --> 00:59:59.374
Ferrari... italian trash.

502
01:00:09.161 --> 01:00:10.423
Do you want to screw me?

503
01:00:12.164 --> 01:00:15.656
Don't laugh! Do you want to screw me, yes or no?

504
01:00:17.102 --> 01:00:18.069
Yes.

505
01:00:22.241 --> 01:00:23.503
How 'bout now, big boy?

506
01:00:24.777 --> 01:00:27.302
Do you still wish to penetrate me...

507
01:00:29.782 --> 01:00:30.814
...or is it I...

508
01:00:30.849 --> 01:00:33.147
...or is it I... who has penetrated you?

509
01:00:34.219 --> 01:00:36.278
<i>See what I mean?</i>

510
01:00:37.723 --> 01:00:42.251
<i>The bald guy in the black suit
and the Kato mask is Johnny Mo,</i>

511
01:00:42.327 --> 01:00:46.787
<i>the head general of O-Ren's
personal army, the Crazy 88.</i>

512
01:00:48.667 --> 01:00:50.897
<i>And just in case
you were wondering</i>

513
01:00:50.969 --> 01:00:54.928
<i>how could a half-breed
Japanese-Chinese American</i>

514
01:00:55.007 --> 01:00:59.842
<i>become the boss of all bosses
in Tokyo, Japan,</i>

515
01:00:59.912 --> 01:01:01.436
<i>I'll tell you.</i>

516
01:01:01.513 --> 01:01:04.277
<i>The subject of O-Ren's blood
and nationality</i>

517
01:01:04.349 --> 01:01:07.045
<i>came up before the council
only once.</i>

518
01:01:07.119 --> 01:01:12.216
<i>The night O-Ren assumed power
over the crime council.</i>

519
01:01:12.291 --> 01:01:14.384
<i>The man who seems bound
and determined</i>

520
01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:17.293
<i>to break the mood
is Boss Tanaka.</i>

521
01:01:17.362 --> 01:01:20.798
<i>And what Boss Tanaka
thinks is...</i>

522
01:01:24.703 --> 01:01:25.692
Boss Tanaka!

523
01:01:26.305 --> 01:01:27.499
What's the meaning of this outburst?

524
01:01:27.573 --> 01:01:29.404
This is a time for celebration!

525
01:01:29.975 --> 01:01:32.773
And what exactly are we celebrating?

526
01:01:34.313 --> 01:01:36.679
The perversion of our illustrious council?

527
01:01:38.684 --> 01:01:41.676
Tanaka, have you gone mad?

528
01:01:41.753 --> 01:01:43.015
I will not tolerate this!

529
01:01:43.088 --> 01:01:45.249
You're disrespecting our sister! Apologize!

530
01:01:46.425 --> 01:01:51.692
Tanaka-San, of what perversion do you speak?

531
01:01:57.603 --> 01:01:59.002
My father...

532
01:01:59.705 --> 01:02:00.763
...along with yours,

533
01:02:00.839 --> 01:02:02.329
and along with yours,
started this council.

534
01:02:03.542 --> 01:02:04.975
And while...

535
01:02:05.043 --> 01:02:06.533
...you laugh like stupid donkeys...

536
01:02:06.612 --> 01:02:08.273
...they weep in the afterlife...

537
01:02:08.914 --> 01:02:09.846
- Shut up!

538
01:02:10.782 --> 01:02:12.613
...over the perversion committed today!

539
01:02:13.385 --> 01:02:15.910
Outrageous!

540
01:02:16.622 --> 01:02:18.783
Tanaka, it is you who insults this council!

541
01:02:18.857 --> 01:02:19.846
Bastard!

542
01:02:20.893 --> 01:02:22.087
Fuck face!

543
01:02:22.528 --> 01:02:24.257
Gentlemen.

544
01:02:26.298 --> 01:02:31.895
Tanaka obviously has something on his mind.

545
01:02:33.438 --> 01:02:37.465
By all means, allow him to express it.

546
01:02:38.544 --> 01:02:43.106
Speak, of the perversion done to this
council,

547
01:02:44.716 --> 01:02:46.081
...which I love...

548
01:02:46.919 --> 01:02:48.386
...more than my own children,

549
01:02:49.454 --> 01:02:54.255
...by making a Chinese Jap-American
half breed bitch its leader!

550
01:03:01.233 --> 01:03:03.667
Aah! Aah!

551
01:03:14.613 --> 01:03:21.348
So that you understand how serious I am...

552
01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:23.615
...I'm going to say this in English.

553
01:03:23.722 --> 01:03:24.654
Huh!

554
01:03:37.502 --> 01:03:39.834
As your leader...

555
01:03:39.905 --> 01:03:41.395
I encourage you
from time to time,

556
01:03:41.473 --> 01:03:46.137
and always in a respectful
manner, to question my logic.

557
01:03:46.211 --> 01:03:47.143
If you're unconvinced

558
01:03:47.212 --> 01:03:49.646
a particular plan of action
I've decided is the wisest,

559
01:03:49.715 --> 01:03:50.909
tell me so.

560
01:03:50.983 --> 01:03:52.541
But allow me to convince you.

561
01:03:52.618 --> 01:03:54.745
And promise you,
right here and now,

562
01:03:54.820 --> 01:03:58.381
no subject will ever be taboo.

563
01:03:58.457 --> 01:04:01.722
Except, of course, the subject
that was just under discussion.

564
01:04:03.895 --> 01:04:05.920
The price you pay

565
01:04:05.998 --> 01:04:08.899
for bringing up either
my Chinese or American heritage

566
01:04:08.967 --> 01:04:12.926
as a negative is,
I collect your fucking head.

567
01:04:13.005 --> 01:04:15.405
Just like this fucker here.

568
01:04:17.776 --> 01:04:20.370
Now, if any of you
sons of bitches

569
01:04:20.445 --> 01:04:25.178
got anything else to say,
now is the fucking time!

570
01:04:27.285 --> 01:04:28.843
Didn't think so.

571
01:04:32.190 --> 01:04:35.057
Gentlemen, this meeting is adjourned.

572
01:04:35.127 --> 01:04:37.618
One ticket to Tokyo please.

573
01:07:12.350 --> 01:07:13.612
<i>Moshi moshi.</i>

574
01:08:49.347 --> 01:08:50.712
Hey!

575
01:08:53.018 --> 01:08:54.383
- Hey, yeah!
- Hey, yeah!

576
01:09:33.591 --> 01:09:35.718
Gogo.

577
01:11:04.182 --> 01:11:06.446
Yeah! Whoo!

578
01:11:49.828 --> 01:11:52.854
You have to say "Yes, yes, yes" to
any selfish demands they make.

579
01:11:52.931 --> 01:11:54.626
They demand ridiculous things.

580
01:11:54.699 --> 01:11:56.963
Shut up... Do you know what would
happen if they heard you?

581
01:11:57.035 --> 01:11:57.865
What's gonna happen?

582
01:11:58.002 --> 01:11:59.401
Did you hear about the Tanaka clan?

583
01:11:59.571 --> 01:12:01.334
You're gonna get your head chopped off.

584
01:12:01.439 --> 01:12:02.269
No, I don't want that.

585
01:12:50.421 --> 01:12:51.547
Yes, it's me.

586
01:12:55.827 --> 01:12:59.126
And if you give us a contact number,
we will get back to you.

587
01:13:14.746 --> 01:13:17.271
Who do you remind me of?

588
01:13:18.449 --> 01:13:20.007
Charlie Brown!

589
01:13:21.419 --> 01:13:23.988
You're right, he does look like
Charlie Brown.

590
01:13:24.023 --> 01:13:24.977
Charlie Brown.

591
01:13:25.256 --> 01:13:26.746
Four pepperoni pizzas.

592
01:13:27.091 --> 01:13:28.319
That's not on our menu...

593
01:13:28.526 --> 01:13:30.721
I don't care, bring them, goddammit!

594
01:13:31.996 --> 01:13:34.590
Hey... hey... Charlie, give me a kiss.

595
01:13:36.267 --> 01:13:38.098
O- Ren Ishii!

596
01:13:39.337 --> 01:13:42.829
You and I have unfinished business!

597
01:15:11.896 --> 01:15:14.421
Charlie Brown, beat it.

598
01:15:22.273 --> 01:15:22.967
Miki.

599
01:15:41.826 --> 01:15:43.259
TEAR THE BITCH APART!

600
01:17:13.751 --> 01:17:19.280
So, O-Ren, anymore subordinates
for me to kill?

601
01:17:20.825 --> 01:17:22.224
Hi!

602
01:17:23.895 --> 01:17:24.827
Gogo, right?

603
01:17:26.631 --> 01:17:28.326
Bingo.

604
01:17:28.399 --> 01:17:30.230
And you're Black Mamba.

605
01:17:32.236 --> 01:17:35.330
Our reputations precede us.

606
01:17:36.674 --> 01:17:38.005
Don't they?

607
01:17:39.777 --> 01:17:45.044
Gogo, I know you feel you must
protect your mistress.

608
01:17:46.184 --> 01:17:48.778
But I beg you.

609
01:17:48.853 --> 01:17:50.480
Walk away.

610
01:17:57.562 --> 01:17:59.223
You call that begging?

611
01:18:05.603 --> 01:18:08.094
You can beg better than that.

612
01:20:07.858 --> 01:20:09.018
Aah!

613
01:20:15.032 --> 01:20:15.623
Aah!

614
01:20:17.969 --> 01:20:18.697
Aah!

615
01:21:22.133 --> 01:21:23.760
Is that what I think it is?

616
01:21:23.834 --> 01:21:26.564
You didn't think it was
gonna be that easy, did you?

617
01:21:27.204 --> 01:21:33.973
You know, for a second there,
yeah, I kind of did.

618
01:21:34.979 --> 01:21:36.708
Silly rabbit.

619
01:21:37.381 --> 01:21:38.211
Trix are for...

620
01:21:38.282 --> 01:21:39.374
Kids.

621
01:21:43.387 --> 01:21:44.877
Hyaaaaaaah!

622
01:22:54.625 --> 01:22:55.683
Hyah!

623
01:23:08.906 --> 01:23:11.136
Aaaaaaaaahh!

624
01:23:29.326 --> 01:23:30.418
Aaahh!

625
01:24:37.494 --> 01:24:38.961
Aaaaahhh!

626
01:25:53.537 --> 01:25:54.469
Aaah!

627
01:28:08.172 --> 01:28:12.871
This is what you get
for fucking around with yakuzas!

628
01:28:12.943 --> 01:28:14.706
Go home to your mother!

629
01:29:13.804 --> 01:29:16.568
Those of you lucky enough to still
have your lives...

630
01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:18.904
...take them with you!

631
01:29:21.011 --> 01:29:22.239
However...

632
01:29:23.614 --> 01:29:27.573
...leave the limbs you've lost.

633
01:29:28.785 --> 01:29:32.152
They belong to me now.

634
01:29:36.593 --> 01:29:39.460
Except you, Sofie!

635
01:29:40.164 --> 01:29:43.463
You stay right where you are.

636
01:30:36.820 --> 01:30:39.311
Your instrument
is quite impressive.

637
01:30:44.027 --> 01:30:45.654
Where was it made?

638
01:30:47.431 --> 01:30:49.058
Okinawa.

639
01:30:50.934 --> 01:30:53.835
Whom in Okinawa made you this steel?

640
01:30:55.072 --> 01:30:57.006
This is Hattori Hanzo steel.

641
01:30:57.074 --> 01:30:58.371
YOU LIE!

642
01:31:06.683 --> 01:31:08.207
Mmm-hmm.

643
01:31:11.288 --> 01:31:13.586
Swords however, never get tired.

644
01:31:14.925 --> 01:31:18.383
Hope you've saved your energy.

645
01:31:22.065 --> 01:31:23.259
If you haven't...

646
01:31:25.402 --> 01:31:27.393
...you might not last five minutes.

647
01:31:29.439 --> 01:31:31.634
But as last looks go,

648
01:31:32.909 --> 01:31:35.469
you could do worse.

649
01:34:13.437 --> 01:34:17.965
Silly Caucasian girl likes
to play with samurai swords.

650
01:34:20.343 --> 01:34:23.244
You may not be able to fight
like a samurai.

651
01:34:26.283 --> 01:34:29.411
But you can at least die
like a samurai.

652
01:34:59.816 --> 01:35:01.283
Attack me...

653
01:35:02.586 --> 01:35:04.144
...with everything you have.

654
01:35:59.409 --> 01:36:02.207
For ridiculing you earlier...

655
01:36:04.748 --> 01:36:06.682
...I apologize.

656
01:36:15.258 --> 01:36:16.418
Accepted.

657
01:36:33.043 --> 01:36:33.941
Ready?

658
01:36:39.049 --> 01:36:40.209
Come on.

659
01:37:13.450 --> 01:37:22.324
That really was a Hattori Hanzo sword.

660
01:39:28.485 --> 01:39:29.952
Sofie.

661
01:39:30.653 --> 01:39:32.518
Sofie.

662
01:39:32.589 --> 01:39:34.420
My Sofie.

663
01:39:34.491 --> 01:39:36.652
I'm so sorry.

664
01:39:39.996 --> 01:39:43.523
Please.
Please forgive my betrayal.

665
01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:45.534
No more of that.

666
01:39:45.602 --> 01:39:47.365
But still...

667
01:39:47.437 --> 01:39:50.065
But still nothing.

668
01:39:51.608 --> 01:39:54.873
Except my aching heart
over what she's done

669
01:39:54.944 --> 01:39:58.345
to my beautiful
and brilliant Sofie.

670
01:39:59.115 --> 01:40:01.948
I've kept you alive
for two reasons.

671
01:40:02.018 --> 01:40:05.086
The first reason is information.

672
01:40:05.121 --> 01:40:07.956
Burn in Hell, you stupid, stupid blonde!

673
01:40:07.991 --> 01:40:09.754
Burn in Hell, you stupid, stupid blonde!
I'll tell you nothing.

674
01:40:11.027 --> 01:40:15.293
But I am gonna ask you
questions.

675
01:40:15.365 --> 01:40:19.461
And every time
you don't give me answers,

676
01:40:19.536 --> 01:40:22.130
I'm gonna cut something off.

677
01:40:22.872 --> 01:40:28.742
And I promise you, they will be
things you will miss!

678
01:40:29.379 --> 01:40:31.176
Give me your other arm!

679
01:40:34.217 --> 01:40:38.916
I want all the information
on the Deadly Vipers.

680
01:40:38.988 --> 01:40:40.148
If you had to guess...

681
01:40:40.223 --> 01:40:41.155
What they've been doing.

682
01:40:41.224 --> 01:40:42.418
Why she left you alive...

683
01:40:42.492 --> 01:40:44.426
And where I can find them.

684
01:40:44.494 --> 01:40:46.394
What would be your guess?

685
01:40:48.398 --> 01:40:51.333
Guessing won't be necessary.

686
01:40:51.401 --> 01:40:53.266
She informed me.

687
01:40:55.505 --> 01:40:59.532
She said I could keep
my wicked life for two reasons.

688
01:41:00.343 --> 01:41:01.742
As I said before,

689
01:41:01.811 --> 01:41:06.441
I've allowed you to keep your
wicked life for two reasons.

690
01:41:06.516 --> 01:41:11.954
And the second reason is
so you can tell him, in person,

691
01:41:12.021 --> 01:41:15.787
everything that happened
here tonight.

692
01:41:15.859 --> 01:41:19.124
I want him to witness
the extent of my mercy

693
01:41:19.195 --> 01:41:22.790
by witnessing
your deformed body.

694
01:41:22.866 --> 01:41:27.132
I want you to tell him all the
information you just told me.

695
01:41:27.203 --> 01:41:30.229
I want him to know what I know.

696
01:41:30.306 --> 01:41:34.037
I want him to know
I want him to know.

697
01:41:34.544 --> 01:41:36.978
And I want them all to know

698
01:41:37.046 --> 01:41:43.007
they'll all soon be
as dead as O-Ren.

699
01:42:07.210 --> 01:42:11.704
Revenge is never a straight line.

700
01:42:14.984 --> 01:42:16.679
It's a forest.

701
01:42:17.987 --> 01:42:20.888
And like a forest it's easy to lose your way...

702
01:42:22.025 --> 01:42:25.051
...to get lost... to forget where you came in.

703
01:42:28.531 --> 01:42:32.831
That woman deserves her revenge.

704
01:42:37.707 --> 01:42:42.076
And we deserve to die.

705
01:42:45.481 --> 01:42:49.383
She must suffer
to her last breath.

706
01:43:02.165 --> 01:43:05.100
How did you find me?

707
01:43:05.168 --> 01:43:06.829
I'm the man.

708
01:43:11.007 --> 01:43:14.443
One more thing, Sofie.

709
01:43:14.510 --> 01:43:18.606
Is she aware her daughter
is still alive?
