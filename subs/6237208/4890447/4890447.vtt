00:48:19.679 --> 00:48:21.550
As long as you don't lie
to me.

906
00:48:21.594 --> 00:48:23.596
Ok.

907
00:48:25.554 --> 00:48:28.122
This person says I should
get expelled.

908
00:48:28.166 --> 00:48:32.213
"What a whore, her nose
is bigger than her tits."

909
00:48:32.257 --> 00:48:36.217
This is crazy.

910
00:48:36.261 --> 00:48:39.612
"She should just kill herself
and do everybody a favour."

911
00:48:39.655 --> 00:48:41.875
"She deserves
to get raped."

912
00:48:41.919 --> 00:48:43.616
They're just trolls.

913
00:48:43.659 --> 00:48:45.966
Nobody posted my name,
right?

914
00:48:46.010 --> 00:48:47.446
No.

915
00:48:47.489 --> 00:48:49.404
But people are gonna
find out.

916
00:48:49.448 --> 00:48:51.319
You know that, right?

917
00:48:51.363 --> 00:48:53.191
There are so many porn
actresses out there,

918
00:48:53.234 --> 00:48:59.153
I just thought it was impossible
for somebody to recognize me.

919
00:48:59.197 --> 00:49:00.633
I mean, I thought I could just
go under the radar.

920
00:49:00.676 --> 00:49:03.244
How could I have been
so stupid?

921
00:49:03.288 --> 00:49:05.681
Look, there are supportive
comments, too.

922
00:49:05.725 --> 00:49:08.815
"Who cares? It's her
body, not yours."

923
00:49:08.858 --> 00:49:10.686
Look.

924
00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:12.993
There's a message
from a girl named Amanda.

925
00:49:13.037 --> 00:49:14.734
Does she want to call me
a whore, too?

926
00:49:14.777 --> 00:49:16.736
Actually, she works
for the school paper.

927
00:49:16.779 --> 00:49:18.216
She wants to talk to you.

928
00:49:18.259 --> 00:49:20.174
Uh, no.

929
00:49:20.218 --> 00:49:23.003
I think it might be
a good idea.

930
00:49:23.047 --> 00:49:25.832
You don't deserve
to be harassed.

931
00:49:31.881 --> 00:49:33.013
Hi.

932
00:49:33.057 --> 00:49:34.058
Uh... I'm Miriam.

933
00:49:34.101 --> 00:49:35.798
Amanda. Wanna sit?

934
00:49:39.846 --> 00:49:41.021
I don't know about this.

935
00:49:41.065 --> 00:49:42.196
I get it.

936
00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:43.763
Gossip spreads fast
on campus.

937
00:49:43.806 --> 00:49:45.025
It's only gonna get rougher,
too.

938
00:49:45.069 --> 00:49:46.592
Right.

939
00:49:46.635 --> 00:49:48.159
And some of the frats and
sororities know who I am,

940
00:49:48.202 --> 00:49:50.639
but my name isn't
totally out there.

941
00:49:50.683 --> 00:49:53.164
For the purposes of my article
I can use an alias.

942
00:49:53.207 --> 00:49:54.339
Whatever you're
comfortable with.

943
00:49:54.382 --> 00:49:58.169
And I promise to be fair.

944
00:49:58.212 --> 00:49:59.953
I just don't know.

945
00:49:59.997 --> 00:50:03.565
This is your chance
to tell your side.

946
00:50:03.609 --> 00:50:05.350
Don't you want to make
lemonade?

947
00:50:10.572 --> 00:50:16.100
You know, the guy who outed
me was watching hardcore porn

948
00:50:16.143 --> 00:50:20.191
and yet I'm the one
who's being called a slut.

949
00:50:20.234 --> 00:50:22.802
Because somehow creating
the content is more shameful

950
00:50:22.845 --> 00:50:25.065
than consuming it?

951
00:50:25.109 --> 00:50:27.198
It's a double standard.

952
00:50:27.241 --> 00:50:31.289
So doing porn, for you,
is a feminist act?

953
00:50:31.332 --> 00:50:32.855
Yeah, in a way.

954
00:50:32.899 --> 00:50:34.074
Is that why you're doing it?

955
00:50:34.118 --> 00:50:36.163
I'm doing it because
I need money.

956
00:50:36.207 --> 00:50:40.080
My parents can't afford the
$60,000 a year tuition at Duke

957
00:50:40.124 --> 00:50:42.996
and I don't want to be
in debt for the rest of my life.

958
00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:44.519
I mean, if I waitressed
part-time

959
00:50:44.563 --> 00:50:49.785
I would maybe make $400 a month,
and it's degrading.

960
00:50:49.829 --> 00:50:53.485
You don't find porn degrading?

961
00:50:53.528 --> 00:50:57.445
Actually, it's empowering.

962
00:50:57.489 --> 00:51:01.188
I get to have this alter-ego.

963
00:51:01.232 --> 00:51:05.410
It's like Miriam is this
serious, studious, nerdy girl

964
00:51:05.453 --> 00:51:11.503
and then Belle is this sexy,
mischievous, uninhibited minx.

965
00:51:11.546 --> 00:51:14.854
Yeah, but... aren't most
of the directors men?

966
00:51:14.897 --> 00:51:16.769
And then the way that
these women are shown,

967
00:51:16.812 --> 00:51:20.338
usually helpless, disposable
sex toys

968
00:51:20.381 --> 00:51:23.080
that exist only to pleasure men.

969
00:51:23.123 --> 00:51:26.779
It's true, a lot of
the directors are men.

970
00:51:26.822 --> 00:51:29.564
But maybe it's time
that that changed.

971
00:51:29.608 --> 00:51:31.740
And there's a lot of different
kinds of porn

972
00:51:31.784 --> 00:51:33.786
for different sexual
preferences.

973
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:35.831
You know, a lot of women,
myself included,

974
00:51:35.875 --> 00:51:39.879
are really turned on by BDSM
and sexual domination.

975
00:51:39.922 --> 00:51:43.970
My sexual preference doesn't
make me any less feminist.

976
00:51:48.757 --> 00:51:51.064
They're all looking at me.

977
00:51:51.108 --> 00:51:52.848
You think they know?

978
00:51:52.892 --> 00:51:55.460
Yeah. They're laughing.

979
00:51:55.503 --> 00:51:59.290
It's like I'm wearing a
scarlet letter or something.

980
00:51:59.333 --> 00:52:02.206
So what do your parents think?

981
00:52:02.249 --> 00:52:05.774
Oh, no. They can't find out.

982
00:52:05.818 --> 00:52:08.821
They're really Catholic
and really conservative

983
00:52:08.864 --> 00:52:11.998
and I know that they would
just freak out.

984
00:52:12.041 --> 00:52:13.826
I mean, my mom would
probably disown me.

985
00:52:13.869 --> 00:52:17.308
They still think I'm a virgin.

986
00:52:17.351 --> 00:52:19.484
I have to get to class.

987
00:52:19.527 --> 00:52:22.617
Ok. Thanks for talking with me.

988
00:52:22.661 --> 00:52:24.750
No, thank you.

989
00:52:24.793 --> 00:52:27.622
I'm really looking forward
to your article.

990
00:52:43.725 --> 00:52:45.553
Slut.

991
00:54:09.898 --> 00:54:12.988
Thank you for being here
for me.

992
00:54:13.032 --> 00:54:14.773
It really means a lot.

993
00:54:17.558 --> 00:54:19.691
I don't have anyone else
to talk to.

994
00:54:19.734 --> 00:54:21.562
Girl, I got you.

995
00:54:21.606 --> 00:54:24.130
Everything's gonna be ok.

996
00:54:24.173 --> 00:54:26.654
You can't let a few a-holes
get to you.

997
00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:33.574
Hi ladies.

998
00:54:33.618 --> 00:54:36.925
What brings you to the women's
centre today?

999
00:54:36.969 --> 00:54:40.755
Last week somebody
put this sign on my door.

1000
00:54:40.799 --> 00:54:43.802
This morning I got a death
threat on my Facebook account.

1001
00:54:43.845 --> 00:54:46.500
The messages I get
are awful.

1002
00:54:46.544 --> 00:54:49.198
That I should kill myself,
I should get expelled.

1003
00:54:49.242 --> 00:54:51.592
I've had garbage thrown
at me.

1004
00:54:51.636 --> 00:54:52.898
I don't know what to do.

1005
00:54:52.941 --> 00:54:54.900
I'm sorry this is happening
to you.

1006
00:54:54.943 --> 00:54:56.815
We are 100 percent here
to support you

1007
00:54:56.858 --> 00:54:59.339
and the university is here
to support you as well, ok?

1008
00:54:59.383 --> 00:55:01.820
We have a zero
tolerance policy

1009
00:55:01.863 --> 00:55:03.691
when it comes to this type
of harassment-

1010
00:55:03.735 --> 00:55:06.303
And it's not just one person,
either.

1011
00:55:06.346 --> 00:55:08.043
Would you like me to speak
to the resident's advisor?

1012
00:55:08.087 --> 00:55:10.132
We could see about moving
your room?

1013
00:55:10.176 --> 00:55:12.134
Maybe to a non-co-ed building.

1014
00:55:12.178 --> 00:55:14.572
No, I love being
Jolie's roommate.

1015
00:55:14.615 --> 00:55:17.923
Ok, well that is an option
if you change your mind.

1016
00:55:17.966 --> 00:55:20.752
So there's no way I'll get
kicked out of school, right?

1017
00:55:20.795 --> 00:55:23.145
No, no. Absolutely not.

1018
00:55:23.189 --> 00:55:26.453
Just so you know, our
perspective is that what you do

1019
00:55:26.497 --> 00:55:29.238
in your own time and how
you choose to make a living,

1020
00:55:29.282 --> 00:55:33.068
as long as it's legal,
is entirely your choice.

1021
00:55:33.112 --> 00:55:35.375
We do not pass
judgment here.

1022
00:55:38.378 --> 00:55:40.206
I really hope you come forward
with a complaint

1023
00:55:40.249 --> 00:55:42.861
and we can figure
this out together.

1024
00:55:42.904 --> 00:55:44.906
Well, I'm not ready to do that.

1025
00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:47.387
At least not yet.

1026
00:55:51.652 --> 00:55:53.219
Thank you so much.

1027
00:55:53.262 --> 00:55:55.090
You've been super helpful.

1028
00:55:55.134 --> 00:55:58.224
Yeah, I actually feel
a little better.

1029
00:55:58.267 --> 00:55:59.704
Good, I'm glad.

1030
00:55:59.747 --> 00:56:02.054
I really think you should reach
out to your family.

1031
00:56:02.097 --> 00:56:03.708
It can be difficult
being isolated

1032
00:56:03.751 --> 00:56:05.405
and if you're feeling bullied

1033
00:56:05.449 --> 00:56:09.104
it's incredibly important you
have a strong support network.

1034
00:56:09.148 --> 00:56:10.454
The stress of trying
to keep a secret

1035
00:56:10.497 --> 00:56:13.239
can often be worse
than coming clean.

1036
00:56:16.503 --> 00:56:17.939
Thanks ladies.

1037
00:56:20.246 --> 00:56:22.030
You guys?

1038
00:56:22.074 --> 00:56:24.032
The article got published.

1039
00:56:30.387 --> 00:56:31.953
Amanda totally lied.

1040
00:56:31.997 --> 00:56:33.520
She said she'd be fair.

1041
00:56:33.564 --> 00:56:36.218
She gave you an alias like
she said she would.

1042
00:56:36.262 --> 00:56:38.525
"Missy makes a compelling
argument.

1043
00:56:38.569 --> 00:56:40.440
"I'm a feminist and to me
that means taking agency

1044
00:56:40.484 --> 00:56:42.486
"over my personal liberty
and my right to choose

1045
00:56:42.529 --> 00:56:44.009
"what to do with my body."

1046
00:56:44.052 --> 00:56:45.576
This is really flattering.

1047
00:56:45.619 --> 00:56:47.447
I don't understand
why you're so upset.

1048
00:56:47.491 --> 00:56:49.667
She makes me sound like
I contradict myself.

1049
00:56:49.710 --> 00:56:51.669
Then she says I'm insecure
and that makes me sound like

1050
00:56:51.712 --> 00:56:55.281
I'm some first-year woman
seeking approval or something.

1051
00:56:55.324 --> 00:56:57.370
She said to make lemonade.

1052
00:56:57.414 --> 00:56:58.719
I don't know.

1053
00:56:58.763 --> 00:57:00.504
I thought she made you sound
pretty good.

1054
00:57:00.547 --> 00:57:02.593
Well, I'm not some insecure,
first-year woman.

1055
00:57:02.636 --> 00:57:04.464
She reduced me to a cliché.

1056
00:57:04.508 --> 00:57:06.597
I think she made you seem
really human.

1057
00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:07.859
And vulnerable.

1058
00:57:07.902 --> 00:57:09.861
I don't want pity.

1059
00:57:09.904 --> 00:57:12.820
I want people to understand
that this is about empowerment.

1060
00:57:12.864 --> 00:57:13.821
I get that, but-

1061
00:57:13.865 --> 00:57:15.257
You know what?

1062
00:57:15.301 --> 00:57:16.781
Let's go to The Foundry tonight.

1063
00:57:16.824 --> 00:57:17.912
I need to get out.

1064
00:57:17.956 --> 00:57:19.348
Really?

1065
00:57:28.314 --> 00:57:29.228
Oh no.

1066
00:57:29.271 --> 00:57:31.099
Look who's here.

1067
00:57:33.928 --> 00:57:35.060
It's fine.

1068
00:57:35.103 --> 00:57:37.279
I'm fine.

1069
00:57:37.323 --> 00:57:39.020
Really.

1070
00:57:43.590 --> 00:57:45.200
Hey.

1071
00:57:45.244 --> 00:57:47.507
Oh, hi.

1072
00:57:47.551 --> 00:57:49.117
How're you doing?

1073
00:57:49.161 --> 00:57:50.858
Pretty good. How about you?

1074
00:57:50.902 --> 00:57:52.294
I'm all good.

1075
00:57:52.338 --> 00:57:55.123
What're you doing later?

1076
00:57:55.167 --> 00:57:57.735
Uh... I don't know.

1077
00:57:57.778 --> 00:57:59.519
You wanna hang out?

I was not told that the actor
would be, like, 50.

I could have never
imagined this.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.611
As a feminist, as a woman

01:04:36.655 --> 01:04:39.919
taking part in porno-
pornographic scenes

1217
01:04:39.963 --> 01:04:41.834
sort of puts uncomfortable,

01:04:41.878 --> 01:04:44.402
unnecessary stereotypes
about there for-

1219
01:04:44.445 --> 01:04:46.970
for lots of men to think is
the norm.

1220
01:04:47.013 --> 01:04:50.756
To me, feminism is not about
acting masculine or feminine,

1221
01:04:50.799 --> 01:04:53.933
it's about having the right
to act in any way we choose.

1222
01:04:53.977 --> 01:04:55.630
There will be lots of people
watching this

1223
01:04:55.674 --> 01:04:59.939
who will be feigning outrage
and yet, secretly,

1224

quite regularly themselves.

01:05:03.334 --> 01:05:05.118
Do you think there's a hypocrisy

1226
01:05:05.162 --> 01:05:08.034
in the way that people treat
pornography in America?

1227
01:05:08.078 --> 01:05:09.775
Of course.

1228
01:05:09.818 --> 01:05:12.560
You know, something like 80
percent of all online traffic

1229
01:05:12.604 --> 01:05:13.997
goes to porn sites.

1230
01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:15.694
She's only eighteen or nineteen,

1231
01:05:15.737 --> 01:05:18.392
so I think we underestimate
how, you know,

1232
01:05:18.436 --> 01:05:20.090
immature and naive she is.

1233
01:05:20.133 --> 01:05:21.656
Definitely.

1234
01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:23.180
We like to say that, you know,
porn is ok, whatever,

1235
01:05:23.223 --> 01:05:24.398
it's just a job.

1236
01:05:24.442 --> 01:05:25.834
Maybe she doesn't identify
with it.

1237
01:05:25.878 --> 01:05:27.445
She probably thought that
I'm gonna go out there,

1238

it's not who I am-

01:05:30.056 --> 01:05:32.885
I think you're right, and...
but...

1240
01:05:32.929 --> 01:05:34.843
also, you gotta own up
to what you do though.

1241
01:05:34.887 --> 01:05:36.541
Because at some point it can
become who you are.

1242
01:05:36.584 --> 01:05:38.891
If I'm honest, I've got a young
daughter, very young,

1243
01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:41.198
only two years old, but if she,
when she is your age,

1244
01:05:41.241 --> 01:05:44.984
decided to do this, I would be
pretty upset as her father.

1246
01:05:46.551 --> 01:05:48.335
I think the important thing
is whether

1247
01:05:48.379 --> 01:05:50.424
the person is doing it
by choice.

1248
01:05:50.468 --> 01:05:51.860
If you have a choice

1249
01:05:51.904 --> 01:05:54.733
I don't see why anyone
would have a problem.

1250
01:05:54.776 --> 01:05:56.996
The choice for me felt
really natural.

1251
01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:59.433
I've always been very

I still have to pay for hair
and makeup and travel,

1427
01:15:22.822 --> 01:15:24.998
so maybe I made like $500.

1428
01:15:25.042 --> 01:15:27.131
But you didn't have to go
down on anyone.

1429
01:15:27.174 --> 01:15:30.526
Yeah.

01:15:30.569 --> 01:15:34.660
Hey, have you heard that people
have been calling me a diva?

1431
01:15:34.704 --> 01:15:36.009
Don't worry about that.

1432
01:15:36.053 --> 01:15:37.358
Why would anyone say that?

1433
01:15:37.402 --> 01:15:38.925
Belle, you're new. You're hot.

1434
01:15:38.969 --> 01:15:40.144
You booked a lot of jobs.

1435
01:15:40.187 --> 01:15:41.841
The other girls,
they're just jealous.

1436
01:15:41.885 --> 01:15:43.669
But I really want people
to like me.

1437
01:15:43.713 --> 01:15:45.323
They do.

Hey, what's going on?

01:16:06.692 --> 01:16:09.042
Nothing, we're just
heading inside.

Um, no.

Something's wrong.

Why don't your friends
like me?

pissing people off

with all your press.

1448

a positive message.

Yeah, I'm fine.

I tell you what.

1455
01:16:45.426 --> 01:16:49.213
If you ever feel like you're
becoming your alter-ego,

1456
01:16:49.256 --> 01:16:51.345
that's when you should
be worried.

1457
01:16:51.389 --> 01:16:55.132
You have to keep fantasy
separate from reality.

1458
01:16:55.175 --> 01:16:59.919
That's how you protect yourself.

1459

out there.

present our final category.

No.

You really don't get it,
do you?

01:18:24.264 --> 01:18:26.049
Nobody asked you to go on
every show and blog

1483
01:18:26.092 --> 01:18:27.485
and speak for us.

1484
01:18:27.528 --> 01:18:29.182
You've been in this industry
for five minutes

1485
01:18:29.226 --> 01:18:31.619
and you don't know
what you're talking about.

1486
01:18:31.663 --> 01:18:33.447
But you love that spotlight

1487
01:18:33.491 --> 01:18:35.928
and I guess that's the most
important thing, huh?

1488
01:18:35.972 --> 01:18:38.191
No, I- I was trying to help.

1489
01:18:38.235 --> 01:18:40.063
Yeah, trying to help yourself.

1490
01:18:40.106 --> 01:18:43.762
None of us need or want
your help, ok?

1491
01:18:43.806 --> 01:18:45.111
I thought we were friends.

1492
01:18:45.155 --> 01:18:46.286
We hung out a couple
of times

1493
01:18:46.330 --> 01:18:48.462
but we hardly know each other.

that naive?

we were friends.

the wheels a little bit.

you have this whole other world
that you're a part of

It'd be a lot for anyone.

1552
01:23:08.157 --> 01:23:12.770
This all started because I just
wanted to pay for school

1553

so out of control.

conservative family.

And while I remain conservative
economically,

01:24:25.886 --> 01:24:28.498
I feel much more
socially liberal

1573
01:24:28.541 --> 01:24:31.718
and in line with libertarian
ideals and themes

1574
01:24:31.762 --> 01:24:35.548
such as free speech, choice,
and autonomy

do with your own body.

Whether I choose to be a
sex worker or a social worker,

I don't need the government
telling me how and what to do
