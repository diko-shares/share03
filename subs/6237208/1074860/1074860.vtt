00:00:38.406 --> 00:00:40.172
         <i> Hi, I'm Belle.</i>

2
00:00:56.157 --> 00:00:58.157
    I'd like to add this sub
     to my third contention

3
00:00:58.259 --> 00:01:00.659
   but I'm worried about time.

4
00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:02.361
  You can chart it on your flow
        and make the call

5
00:01:02.463 --> 00:01:05.464
      when you're up there.

6
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:07.900
     Oh my god. One o'clock.

7
00:01:08.002 --> 00:01:10.235
 I think he's on the other team.

8
00:01:10.337 --> 00:01:12.504
I will gladly argue the negative
          on that case.

9
00:01:12.606 --> 00:01:15.674
  First, he has zero nerd cred.

10
00:01:15.776 --> 00:01:18.310
    Secondly, he's imminently
            do-able.

11
00:01:18.412 --> 00:01:20.312
      If I'm wondering what
      he looks like naked,

12
00:01:20.414 --> 00:01:22.281
           which I am,

13
00:01:22.383 --> 00:01:24.650
       then there's no way
        he's on the team.

14
00:01:24.752 --> 00:01:26.652
         ( whispering )
      You have a boyfriend.

15
00:01:26.754 --> 00:01:28.387
        I'm just saying.

16
00:01:28.489 --> 00:01:31.723
 <i> Next we have a Lincoln-Douglas</i>
          <i> style debate</i>

17
00:01:31.826 --> 00:01:34.726
    on whether it is morally
    permissible for a victim

18
00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.996
       to use deadly force
    as a deliberate response

19
00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:40.666
 to repeated domestic violence.

20
00:01:40.768 --> 00:01:43.602
  Speaking for the affirmative
       from Ferndale Prep,

21
00:01:43.704 --> 00:01:45.404
       Miss Miriam Weeks.

22
00:01:45.506 --> 00:01:46.405
             Miriam?

23
00:01:46.507 --> 00:01:47.806
       Make it rain, girl.

24
00:01:47.908 --> 00:01:49.675
          ( applause )

25
00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.954
  I affirm the resolution that
    it is morally permissible

26
00:02:02.056 --> 00:02:06.058
 for victims to use deadly force
    as a deliberate response

27
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.328
 to repeated domestic violence.

28
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.432
 I define "moral" as pertaining
     to, or concerned with,

29
00:02:13.534 --> 00:02:16.034
     the principles of right
           and wrong.

30
00:02:16.137 --> 00:02:20.105
   "Permissible" as permitted
          or allowable.

31
00:02:20.207 --> 00:02:23.375
   A "victim" as a person who
   suffers from a destructive

32
00:02:23.477 --> 00:02:27.279
       or injurious action
           or agency.

33
00:02:27.381 --> 00:02:31.617
    My value for this debate
           is justice.

34
00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:35.154
   Plato defines "justice" as
   doing well to one's friend

35
00:02:35.256 --> 00:02:36.855
          if he's good

36
00:02:36.957 --> 00:02:39.925
    <i> and harming one's enemy</i>
         <i> if he is evil.</i>

37
00:02:40.027 --> 00:02:42.161
   <i> ( Ralph ): Miriam, can you</i>
         <i> come in here?</i>

38
00:02:44.965 --> 00:02:47.299
        You got something
       in the mail today.

39
00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:50.869
 It's from uh, Duke University.

40
00:02:50.971 --> 00:02:52.271
  You ever heard of that place?

41
00:02:52.373 --> 00:02:53.272
<i>Oh, honey. Just give it to her.</i>

42
00:02:53.374 --> 00:02:53.739
         Let me see it.

43
00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:55.908
              Aah.

44
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.976
     Oh my gosh, this is it.

45
00:02:58.078 --> 00:02:58.844
      It's a big envelope.

46
00:02:58.946 --> 00:03:00.012
          Is that good?

47
00:03:00.114 --> 00:03:01.346
    Only one way to find out.

48
00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:10.222
            I got in!

49
00:03:10.324 --> 00:03:11.290
              Yes!

50
00:03:11.392 --> 00:03:13.158
          ( squealing )

51
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.160
          Bring it in.

52
00:03:15.262 --> 00:03:16.862
        See? I told you.

53
00:03:16.964 --> 00:03:18.463
 When you put your studies first

54
00:03:18.566 --> 00:03:20.465
and you're willing to work hard-

55
00:03:20.568 --> 00:03:22.935
        ( simultaneous )
       Good things happen.

56
00:03:23.037 --> 00:03:26.438
   What kind of financial aid
     package did they offer?

57
00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.275
 That part of the offer appears
  to be a little underwhelming.

58
00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:31.810
        It's Duke though.

59
00:03:31.912 --> 00:03:34.179
   But Vanderbilt offered you
          a full ride.

60
00:03:34.281 --> 00:03:35.714
   It's just as good a school.

61
00:03:35.816 --> 00:03:38.917
  But Duke is my dream school,
and it's number one for pre-law.

62
00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.118
       It's your decision.

63
00:03:40.221 --> 00:03:41.787
       If Duke is what you
     have your heart set on

64
00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:45.090
   then we'll figure out a way
   to make the finances work.

65
00:03:45.192 --> 00:03:46.792
        Thank you, daddy!

66
00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:52.431
        To the graduates.

67
00:03:52.533 --> 00:03:53.732
           Here, here.

68
00:03:55.536 --> 00:03:56.802
  <i> ( Mom ): To Miriam and Josh.</i>

69
00:03:58.205 --> 00:03:59.671
     So, big day little sis.

70
00:03:59.773 --> 00:04:01.907
  Do you feel any different now
       that it's official?

71
00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:03.375
        Mmm, not really.

72
00:04:03.477 --> 00:04:05.143
   I'm just relieved, mostly.

73
00:04:05.246 --> 00:04:07.045
   All the hard work paid off.

74
00:04:07.147 --> 00:04:10.015
      <i> ( Mom ): And now you</i>
   <i> can't be mad about having</i>
        <i> a strict curfew.</i>

75
00:04:10.117 --> 00:04:11.883
   <i> ( Miriam ): I can still be</i>
         <i> a little mad.</i>

76
00:04:15.656 --> 00:04:19.524
            Uh, wait.
        Let's say grace.

77
00:04:19.627 --> 00:04:23.061
 Lord, thank you for these gifts
  which we are about to receive

78
00:04:23.163 --> 00:04:24.963
       through the bounty
           of Christ.

79
00:04:25.065 --> 00:04:25.664
              Amen.

80
00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:27.099
              Amen.

81
00:04:28.535 --> 00:04:29.768
              Amen.

82
00:04:32.673 --> 00:04:34.539
      Hey. What's going on?

83
00:04:34.642 --> 00:04:35.507
   You're being really weird.

84
00:04:35.609 --> 00:04:37.442
          No, I'm not.

85
00:04:37.544 --> 00:04:38.810
         Yeah, you are.

86
00:04:38.912 --> 00:04:42.748
  I just don't need you hanging
     on me every second, ok?

87
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.250
        Look. I'm sorry.

88
00:04:45.352 --> 00:04:47.653
     But I feel like I need
          to be honest.

89
00:04:47.755 --> 00:04:50.956
 We're gonna be 3,000 miles away
from each other next year and I-

90
00:04:51.058 --> 00:04:52.157
               No-

91
00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:53.158
       I don't think that
      it's such a good idea

92
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.062
 if either of us are tied down.

93
00:04:57.164 --> 00:04:59.097
  You know I'm crazy about you.

94
00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:01.166
    But it just makes sense.

95
00:05:01.268 --> 00:05:03.869
     I want to have fun, and
     I want you to have fun.

96
00:05:03.971 --> 00:05:06.104
     You're gonna go to Duke
   and you're gonna meet guys

97
00:05:06.206 --> 00:05:08.106
    and you're gonna wanna go
       on dates and party-

98
00:05:08.208 --> 00:05:10.575
 No, don't tell me what I want.

99
00:05:10.678 --> 00:05:11.943
 This is about you and the fact

100
00:05:12.046 --> 00:05:13.278
      that you want to get
 with other girls, just say it.

101
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.747
       I made up my mind.

102
00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:18.216
    Don't embarrass yourself,
             Miriam.

This is such a beautiful campus.

      This map is basically

      I have to take this.

            Go ahead.

118
00:06:17.177 --> 00:06:18.310
               Ok.

119
00:06:21.315 --> 00:06:22.814
    Is this a co-ed building?

120
00:06:22.916 --> 00:06:25.751
   Mom, most dorms are co-ed.

121
00:06:25.853 --> 00:06:27.252
   I don't think that's true.

122
00:06:27.354 --> 00:06:28.954
    I'm pretty sure my dorms
           were co-ed.

123

     I don't remember that.

124
00:06:30.624 --> 00:06:31.923
      Of course you don't.

125
00:06:32.025 --> 00:06:34.760
     You probably never even
  noticed because Paul's a guy.

126
00:06:34.862 --> 00:06:36.661
       I didn't say that.

127
00:06:36.764 --> 00:06:38.296
       You didn't have to.

128
00:06:43.036 --> 00:06:44.469
          ( whistles )

129
00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:48.006
     This room is way nicer
         than mine was.

130
00:06:48.108 --> 00:06:50.809
  It could use a little bit of
           warming up.

131
00:06:52.713 --> 00:06:54.146
          It's perfect.

132
00:06:56.316 --> 00:06:58.717
          What's wrong?

133
00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:01.553
     I'm getting called back
         to Afghanistan.

134
00:07:01.655 --> 00:07:02.387
              What?

135
00:07:02.489 --> 00:07:03.822
     Can't someone else go?

136
00:07:03.924 --> 00:07:05.190

         <i> your practice.</i>

138
00:07:07.961 --> 00:07:09.928
     That's a huge pay cut.

139
00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.198
   We can still afford for me

    I don't want you to worry
           about this.

141

       We're from Spokane,
           Washington.

148

Hi, Miriam. Hi, Miriam's family.

149

    It's nice to meet y'all.

    Oh, Nola, that's so cool.

153
00:07:37.724 --> 00:07:39.558

  Yeah, it's fun, but Jazz Fest
    is way better, trust me.

00:07:44.131 --> 00:07:45.664
  Well, it's nice to meet you,
              dear.

156
00:07:45.766 --> 00:07:47.933
      Let's go get the rest
          of the stuff.

157
00:07:49.736 --> 00:07:51.703
           ( inhales )

158
00:07:51.805 --> 00:07:53.939
         You smell that?

159
00:07:54.041 --> 00:07:55.640
              What?

160
00:07:55.742 --> 00:07:58.477
     The sweet, sweet smell
           of freedom.

161
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:04.816
      So how'd you find out
        about this party?

162
00:08:04.918 --> 00:08:06.017
        Are you kidding?

163
00:08:06.119 --> 00:08:07.919
   This is a big party campus.

164
00:08:08.021 --> 00:08:10.155
  Plus, it's Independence Day.

165
00:08:10.257 --> 00:08:13.191
   The first official night on
   campus before class starts?

166
00:08:13.293 --> 00:08:17.095
 It's so weird to just not have
 to tell anyone where I'm going.

167
00:08:17.197 --> 00:08:19.531
     My mom watched me like
     a hawk in high school.

168
00:08:19.633 --> 00:08:22.434
    So did mine, but I sorta
          deserved it.

169
00:08:22.536 --> 00:08:24.769
 I did everything I was supposed
             to do.

170
00:08:24.872 --> 00:08:27.239
          All the time.

171
00:08:27.341 --> 00:08:29.341
     Hey, I like your purse.

172
00:08:29.443 --> 00:08:31.176
          Thanks, girl.

173
00:08:33.747 --> 00:08:35.447
      Woah, that's no joke.

174
00:08:37.918 --> 00:08:39.184
          It's nothing.

175
00:08:39.286 --> 00:08:41.820
   I guess I just had my Girl
Interrupted phase in high school

176
00:08:41.922 --> 00:08:44.856
     or whatever, you know?

177
00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:49.794
         Yeah, totally.

178
00:08:49.897 --> 00:08:51.596
      So what do you think
     you're gonna major in?

179
00:08:51.698 --> 00:08:54.199
    Well, I've always wanted
   to be a lawyer, so pre-law,

180
00:08:54.301 --> 00:08:56.635
     but I'm also interested
       in women's studies.

181
00:08:56.737 --> 00:08:57.736
         What about you?

182
00:08:57.838 --> 00:08:59.170
          Oh, no idea.

183
00:08:59.273 --> 00:09:01.940
    Right now I'm just ready
   to major in finding a buzz.

   Hi. It's nice to meet you.

222
00:11:00.227 --> 00:11:01.493
          Hey, you too.

223
00:11:01.595 --> 00:11:03.695
  Uh, so I just heard Theta Tao
       is throwing a party

224
00:11:03.797 --> 00:11:07.098
    and it is supposed to be
            bananas,

225
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.234
  and plus I plan to rush Theta

226
00:11:09.336 --> 00:11:11.736
    so I gotta get my ground
           game going.

227
00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:13.605
      Would you ladies like
           to partake?

228
00:11:13.707 --> 00:11:15.473

        I'm gonna crash.

00:11:15.575 --> 00:11:18.510

237
00:11:37.064 --> 00:11:40.265
  All of these words are deeply
   ingrained into our psyche.

238
00:11:40.367 --> 00:11:42.300
        But what do they
          really mean?

239
00:11:42.402 --> 00:11:45.837
 What we will do in this course
     is challenge ourselves.

240
00:11:45.939 --> 00:11:49.274
     Challenge ourselves to
   re-examine our own beliefs

241
00:11:49.376 --> 00:11:51.209

00:12:02.355 --> 00:12:05.223
 Um, it's fine. What's going on?

247
00:12:05.325 --> 00:12:07.125
 Well, I needed to talk to you.

248
00:12:07.227 --> 00:12:12.764
    <i> Uh, your dad and I can't</i>
 <i> cover your tuition right now.</i>

249
00:12:12.866 --> 00:12:15.366
        What do you mean?

250

  <i> We're overextended with the</i>
<i>huge pay cut your dad has taken.</i>

251
00:12:18.972 --> 00:12:20.572
   You said it would be fine.

252
00:12:20.674 --> 00:12:22.340
    <i> It will be, don't worry.</i>

253
00:12:22.442 --> 00:12:25.210
   It just means you take out
           some loans.

254
00:12:25.312 --> 00:12:26.878
  No, I don't want to do that.

255
00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:28.713
    Dad was still paying off
    his medical school loans

256
00:12:28.815 --> 00:12:30.148
  until I was in middle school.

257
00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.117
  I'll be in debt for the rest
           of my life.

258
00:12:32.219 --> 00:12:33.785
     <i> I'm so sorry, sweetie.</i>

259
00:12:33.887 --> 00:12:36.254
  <i> You know if we had the money</i>
    <i> we would give it to you.</i>

260
00:12:36.356 --> 00:12:39.457
     <i> Maybe you should talk</i>
       <i> to financial aid.</i>

261
00:12:46.433 --> 00:12:47.966
     How did the meeting go?

262
00:12:48.068 --> 00:12:50.835
       Horrible. It's like
      I'm in no man's land.

263
00:12:50.937 --> 00:12:53.438
 My parents make too much money
  to qualify for financial aid

264
00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:56.174
         but not enough
   to actually pay for school.

265
00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:58.409
        I don't know what
       I'm supposed to do.

266
00:12:58.512 --> 00:12:59.944
          I don't know.

267
00:13:00.046 --> 00:13:02.347
       You could get a job
           on campus.

268
00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:05.116
   Tuition is $4,300 a month.

269
00:13:05.218 --> 00:13:06.584
   I couldn't even make a dent
             in that

270
00:13:06.686 --> 00:13:08.953
     with the types of jobs
          I could get.

271
00:13:09.055 --> 00:13:11.022
        Don't waitresses
        make good money?

272
00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:12.524
    I'm guessing you haven't
           waitressed.

273
00:13:12.626 --> 00:13:14.759
No. I always wanted a summer job

274
00:13:14.861 --> 00:13:17.495
      but my family goes to
     the Cape every summer.

275
00:13:17.597 --> 00:13:18.830
          You're lucky.

276
00:13:18.932 --> 00:13:22.200
  I did it once at a pie house
    and the tips were awful,

277
00:13:22.302 --> 00:13:25.436
    the customers were rude,
    it was kind of degrading.

278
00:13:25.539 --> 00:13:26.805
    Can't you take out loans?

279
00:13:26.907 --> 00:13:29.507
   I don't want to be in debt
    for the rest of my life.

280
00:13:29.609 --> 00:13:30.975
    You know what? Screw it.

281
00:13:31.077 --> 00:13:32.977
   I'll start a Ponzi scheme.

282
00:13:33.079 --> 00:13:34.245
      That's too much work.

283
00:13:34.347 --> 00:13:35.713
      You could rob a bank?

284
00:13:35.816 --> 00:13:37.415
     Or become a porn star.

285
00:13:37.517 --> 00:13:39.317
           ( laughs )

286
00:15:54.287 --> 00:15:56.587
       What are you doing?

287
00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:57.588
            Nothing.

288
00:15:57.691 --> 00:16:00.091
   Sorry, I just can't sleep.

289
00:16:14.708 --> 00:16:22.380

    What? Where're you goin'?

313
00:17:19.973 --> 00:17:23.975
   Oh, uh... my friend Amy is
    having kind of a meltdown

314
00:17:24.077 --> 00:17:27.078
     so I'm gonna visit her
       this weekend in DC.

315
00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:30.882
    I just organized a movie
marathon slash pajama jammie jam

316
00:17:30.984 --> 00:17:32.083
     with a bunch of people.

317

        You'd like them.

318
00:17:33.453 --> 00:17:35.119

320
00:17:36.356 --> 00:17:38.589
 Hey. Miriam, you remember Jeff,
             right?

321
00:17:38.691 --> 00:17:39.190

324
00:17:41.094 --> 00:17:43.628
    No. She's going to visit
         her friend Amy.

325
00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:45.696
   Wait, she's in Georgetown,
             right?

326
00:17:45.799 --> 00:17:46.931
           ( laughs )

327
00:17:47.033 --> 00:17:48.866

         You got shoes?

355
00:18:55.735 --> 00:18:58.202
        Yeah. Um... where
        should I change?

       just down the hall.

360
00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:05.676
 I need you to sign this release
      before we get going.

361
00:19:05.778 --> 00:19:08.012
    It just says you get paid
   after we finish the scene,

362
00:19:08.114 --> 00:19:11.449
   nobody's gonna sue anybody,
you're eighteen, blah blah blah.

363

         Um, Belle Knox.

376
00:19:54.327 --> 00:19:56.827
     Belle, like Beauty and
      the Beast, you know?

377
00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:58.429
   <i> Oh, you like fairy tales?</i>

378
00:19:58.531 --> 00:20:00.698
      We got a real special

00:20:04.938 --> 00:20:05.836
        How old are you?

383
00:20:05.939 --> 00:20:07.205

    Women's studies and law.

388
00:20:14.347 --> 00:20:15.780
     <i> Yeah? Women's studies?</i>

389
00:20:15.882 --> 00:20:17.148
      <i> Are you a feminist?</i>

390
00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:18.382
              Yeah.

391
00:20:18.484 --> 00:20:21.118
          <i> A femi-Nazi,</i>
    <i> that's what we call 'em.</i>

392
00:20:21.221 --> 00:20:23.754
        What're you doing
       at Facial Assault?

393
00:20:23.856 --> 00:20:25.790
 You must really be a dumb slut.

394
00:20:27.727 --> 00:20:29.894
     Um... I like rough sex.

395
00:20:29.996 --> 00:20:31.829
       <i> You think so, huh?</i>

396
00:20:31.931 --> 00:20:33.831
      <i> Do you have any idea</i>
      <i> what you're in for?</i>

397
00:20:33.933 --> 00:20:35.333
    <i> I don't think she does.</i>

398
00:20:35.435 --> 00:20:37.268
     <i> We're gonna teach you</i>
      <i> a lesson in feminism</i>

399
00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:39.036
     <i> you will never forget.</i>

400
00:20:39.138 --> 00:20:40.638
           ( laughs )

401
00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.306
        You know, you got
      a really dumb laugh.

402
00:20:42.408 --> 00:20:43.307
            ( slap )

403
00:20:43.409 --> 00:20:45.710
     Why don't you shut up?

404
00:20:45.812 --> 00:20:46.277
           <i> Stand up.</i>

405
00:20:46.379 --> 00:20:48.312
           Wait! Wait!

406
00:20:49.415 --> 00:20:50.147
       <i> Take off your top.</i>

407
00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:51.148
               Ok.

00:20:52.885 --> 00:20:53.751
   <i> He's got something to put</i>
         <i> in your mouth</i>

409
00:20:53.853 --> 00:20:56.687
 <i> that's gonna make you shut up.</i>

410
00:20:56.789 --> 00:20:57.588
         No, wait, stop!

411
00:20:57.690 --> 00:20:59.056
         Stop! Time out!

412
00:20:59.158 --> 00:21:02.226
   You're actually hurting me,
that's not what I signed up for.

413
00:21:03.763 --> 00:21:05.062
     That's exactly what you
          signed up for

414
00:21:05.164 --> 00:21:07.898
     and if you don't finish
 this scene you don't get paid.

415
00:21:08.001 --> 00:21:09.333
   <i> It's very unprofessional,</i>
            <i> though.</i>

416
00:21:09.435 --> 00:21:11.135
   <i> We all showed up to work.</i>

417
00:21:11.237 --> 00:21:12.803
    You'll never work again.

418
00:21:15.074 --> 00:21:18.209
   <i> No, it's ok. I'll finish.</i>

419
00:21:18.311 --> 00:21:20.911
    But you don't have to hit
            so hard.

420
00:21:21.014 --> 00:21:23.781
  I can make it look real, ok?

421
00:21:23.883 --> 00:21:25.750
            Yeah, ok.

422
00:21:28.621 --> 00:21:30.154
        Ok, let's do it.

423
00:21:31.658 --> 00:21:35.693
    <i> Oh, so you're a cutter.</i>

424
00:21:35.795 --> 00:21:37.295
     I said open your mouth!

425
00:21:37.397 --> 00:21:43.200
  <i> You can't cut away the fact</i>
<i>that are a worthless, dumb slut.</i>

426
00:21:43.303 --> 00:21:50.174
           ( sobbing )

427
00:21:50.276 --> 00:21:57.548
           ( sobbing )

428
00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:09.827
         ( phone rings )

429
00:22:09.929 --> 00:22:10.661
             Hello?

430
00:22:10.763 --> 00:22:13.230
      Hey, Mir. How's Duke?

431
00:22:13.333 --> 00:22:14.532
       <i> How's everything?</i>

432
00:22:14.634 --> 00:22:18.002
        It's so awesome.

433
00:22:18.104 --> 00:22:21.238
   The campus is so beautiful.

434
00:22:21.341 --> 00:22:23.708
 <i> I'm just at the church helping</i>
  <i> with the food drive and uh,</i>

435
00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:25.142
<i>I thought of you because, well,</i>

436
00:22:25.244 --> 00:22:27.645
    <i> you basically organized</i>
  <i> this whole thing last year.</i>

437
00:22:27.747 --> 00:22:29.980
     <i> Everyone keeps asking</i>
           <i> about you.</i>

438
00:22:30.083 --> 00:22:31.949
             Really?

439
00:22:32.051 --> 00:22:34.819
          That's nice.

440
00:22:34.921 --> 00:22:36.354
             Mir...

441
00:22:36.456 --> 00:22:37.254
         <i> What's wrong?</i>

442
00:22:37.357 --> 00:22:39.390
  <i> I can hear it in your voice.</i>

443
00:22:39.492 --> 00:22:42.860
          It's stupid.

444
00:22:42.962 --> 00:22:45.963
    I'm just kinda homesick.

445
00:22:46.065 --> 00:22:47.798
    It's really lonely here.

446
00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:49.233
     <i> That's totally normal.</i>

447
00:22:49.335 --> 00:22:50.568
  <i> It's a big change, you know?</i>

448
00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:51.936
  <i> Just take some deep breaths.</i>

449
00:22:52.038 --> 00:22:55.940
  <i> I know you're gonna crush it</i>
           <i> on campus.</i>

       Thank you, Paulie.

451
00:22:59.379 --> 00:23:00.745
           I love you.

452
00:23:00.847 --> 00:23:02.046

           ( sobbing )

456
00:23:19.232 --> 00:23:21.265
    Why couldn't I have seen
       all of this before?

457
00:23:55.501 --> 00:23:58.135
           ( ringing )

   Hi. Is this Don at Pinnatus
             Models?

460
00:24:03.509 --> 00:24:04.708
    Yeah, how can I help you?

461
00:24:04.811 --> 00:24:06.177
           Can I sit?

462
00:24:06.279 --> 00:24:10.881
   Hi. Uh... my name is Belle
  and I just did my first scene

463
00:24:10.983 --> 00:24:12.950
       with a site called
         Facial Assault.

464
00:24:13.052 --> 00:24:15.553
       Facial Assault are
      unprofessional clowns

465
00:24:15.655 --> 00:24:17.221
       <i> that pray on women</i>
      <i> new to the business.</i>

466
00:24:17.323 --> 00:24:19.523
   <i> Your first scene should be</i>
   <i> something nice and sweet,</i>

467
00:24:19.625 --> 00:24:20.891
       <i> like girl on girl.</i>

468
00:24:20.993 --> 00:24:22.326
      <i> Not hardcore facial.</i>

469
00:24:22.428 --> 00:24:23.727
 <i> You probably didn't even have</i>
          <i> a safe word.</i>

470
00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:24.829
        No. What is that?

471
00:24:24.931 --> 00:24:27.198
        <i> Everyone on set,</i>
    <i> before the cameras roll,</i>

472
00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:28.699
     <i> is given a safe word.</i>

473
00:24:28.801 --> 00:24:30.134
 So then, while you're shooting,
  if anyone feels uncomfortable

474
00:24:30.236 --> 00:24:31.268
you just call out the safe word,

475
00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:32.536
         everyone stops
       what they're doing

476
00:24:32.638 --> 00:24:34.038
         <i> and makes sure</i>
      <i> that everyone's ok.</i>

477
00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:36.106
         That's actually
      why I'm calling you.

478
00:24:36.209 --> 00:24:38.342
        I'm wondering how
       your agency works.

479
00:24:38.444 --> 00:24:42.046
   I mean, I'm a student and I
 really need to pay my tuition.

480
00:24:42.148 --> 00:24:43.914
     It's a super expensive
             school.

481
00:24:44.016 --> 00:24:46.250
       <i> What's the school?</i>

482
00:24:46.352 --> 00:24:47.151
              Duke.

483
00:24:47.253 --> 00:24:48.319
              Duke.

484
00:24:48.421 --> 00:24:49.787
      Ah, that's the school
         for smart kids.

485
00:24:49.889 --> 00:24:54.024
  Nobody can know so I have to
  work when I'm not in school.

486
00:24:54.126 --> 00:24:55.226
  <i> Well, send me some pictures.</i>

487
00:24:55.328 --> 00:24:56.227
     That's the first thing
          you gotta do,

488
00:24:56.329 --> 00:24:57.695
  and if I decide to represent
              you,

489
00:24:57.797 --> 00:24:59.029
       <i> you can make some</i>
  <i> real money even only working</i>

490
00:24:59.131 --> 00:25:00.264
        <i> on the weekends.</i>

491
00:25:00.366 --> 00:25:04.168
 Ok. Thank you so much for being
            so nice.

492
00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:05.603
   <i> I'm not being nice, Belle.</i>

493
00:25:05.705 --> 00:25:07.004
   I'm being professional, ok?

494
00:25:07.106 --> 00:25:08.973
     Send me those pictures.

495
00:25:09.075 --> 00:25:10.674
              Bye.

496
00:25:12.545 --> 00:25:15.446
   Call me if you want to make
           some money.

497
00:25:15.548 --> 00:25:24.488
         ( phone rings )

498
00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:25.356
               Hi.

499
00:25:25.458 --> 00:25:26.924
      Hey. I just got home.

500
00:25:27.026 --> 00:25:28.692
   When are you getting here?

501
00:25:28.794 --> 00:25:30.661
   Yeah, actually it turns out

502
00:25:30.763 --> 00:25:32.930
       I'm not coming home
        for Thanksgiving.

503
00:25:33.032 --> 00:25:34.498
          What? No way.

504
00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:35.666
              Why?

505
00:25:35.768 --> 00:25:37.301
      I really need to save
            the money

506
00:25:37.403 --> 00:25:39.603
 and my roommate is staying too,

507
00:25:39.705 --> 00:25:41.805
  so we're gonna have a potluck
  with some of the other people

508
00:25:41.908 --> 00:25:44.108
   who are staying on campus.

509
00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:46.310
      I totally understand.

510
00:25:46.412 --> 00:25:49.947
    It's just... I miss you.

511
00:25:50.049 --> 00:25:52.383
        I miss you, too.

512
00:25:55.988 --> 00:25:57.988
         Gobble, gobble.

513
00:25:58.090 --> 00:25:59.623
   Are you excited to go home?

514
00:25:59.725 --> 00:26:05.162
Yeah. I can't wait to just relax
        and see the fam.

515
00:26:05.264 --> 00:26:06.530
    You leave tonight, right?

516
00:26:06.632 --> 00:26:08.766
     Yeah, I leave at 7:00.

517
00:26:08.868 --> 00:26:10.234
   What do you have in there?

518
00:26:10.336 --> 00:26:12.803
     I'm pretty much packing
    pajamas to be a sloth in.

519
00:26:12.905 --> 00:26:14.638
   I just like to be prepared.

520
00:26:23.449 --> 00:26:24.982
           Excuse me.

521
00:26:25.084 --> 00:26:27.184
        Hi, are you Don?

522
00:26:27.286 --> 00:26:28.719
       Yes. Are you Belle?

523
00:26:28.821 --> 00:26:29.987
              Yeah.

524
00:26:30.089 --> 00:26:33.090
      You are much prettier
     than your photographs.

525
00:26:33.192 --> 00:26:34.592
      Let me get that bag.

526
00:26:34.694 --> 00:26:35.793
           Thank you.

527
00:26:35.895 --> 00:26:40.464
       Ok, now welcome to

00:28:22.968 --> 00:28:24.301
              Hey.

  first legitimate adult scene.

553
00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:29.440
        And so, be nice.

554
00:28:29.542 --> 00:28:31.709
   Oh my gosh! Girl, welcome.

555
00:28:31.811 --> 00:28:32.910
        You are so cute.

556
00:28:33.012 --> 00:28:34.278
   Oh my god, this is gonna be
          so much fun.

557
00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:36.947
     Now, have you ever been
          with a girl?

558
00:28:37.049 --> 00:28:40.517
 Well, I've actually identified
     as bisexual for a while

559
00:28:40.619 --> 00:28:44.521
but I've never fully explored it
     so I'm kind of excited.

560
00:28:44.623 --> 00:28:47.391
Me too. It's gonna be super fun.

561
00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:55.666
          There you go.

562
00:28:55.768 --> 00:28:57.067
      Do you have wardrobe
         on under that?

563
00:28:57.169 --> 00:28:58.001
              Yeah.

564
00:29:02.875 --> 00:29:06.176
   I'm just gonna put a little
       something on there.

565
00:29:09.815 --> 00:29:11.215
           Thank you.

566
00:29:11.317 --> 00:29:14.585

569
00:29:19.959 --> 00:29:21.859
           Oh my gosh.

570
00:29:21.961 --> 00:29:23.026
      How did you do that?

571
00:29:23.129 --> 00:29:25.262
    I look like a completely
        different person.

572
00:29:25.364 --> 00:29:28.065
     No, you just look like
         the other you.

573
00:29:28.167 --> 00:29:31.635

   who's ready to get banged.

575

             Action.

577
00:29:41.347 --> 00:29:42.579

     to entertain ourselves.

580
00:29:53.659 --> 00:29:54.925
              Mmm.

581
00:30:01.634 --> 00:30:03.267

582
00:30:03.369 --> 00:30:07.237
  Uh, Belle? Can I have a word?

583
00:30:07.339 --> 00:30:08.605
     I'm sorry, I'm nervous.

584
00:30:08.707 --> 00:30:10.674
   This feels really official.

585
00:30:10.776 --> 00:30:12.075
            It's ok.

586
00:30:12.178 --> 00:30:13.076

    with someone you just met

588

     It's ok to be nervous.

       and I, are working.

591

           their job.

592

593
00:30:24.089 --> 00:30:26.523
      Or at least look like
       you're having fun.

594
00:30:26.625 --> 00:30:28.992
     Belle, do you like sex?

595
00:30:29.094 --> 00:30:30.994
           Yeah, I do.

596
00:30:31.096 --> 00:30:33.797
         Ok. Go get her.

00:38:42.954 --> 00:38:45.088
   You're not gonna tell dad,
            are you?

769
00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:47.924
    Well, I won't lie to him.

770
00:38:48.026 --> 00:38:51.227
    But I will wait until he
   gets home from Afghanistan.

771
00:38:51.330 --> 00:38:53.830
    He doesn't need this kind
         of stress, too.

772
00:38:57.202 --> 00:38:58.635
         Seriously, Mir.

773
00:38:58.737 --> 00:39:01.971
  How could you possibly think
           this is ok?

774
00:39:02.074 --> 00:39:04.474
        ( message alert )

775
00:39:13.885 --> 00:39:17.554
            Hey, mom?

776
00:39:17.656 --> 00:39:21.257
So... you remember I was telling
 you about that women's charity

777
00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:24.027
  I'm involved with on campus?

778
00:39:24.129 --> 00:39:26.029
              Yes.

779
00:39:26.131 --> 00:39:29.199
   Well, uh... I'm organizing
          a fundraiser

780
00:39:29.301 --> 00:39:33.403
 so I'm gonna need to head home
         two days early.

781
00:39:33.505 --> 00:39:36.740
   So you're not gonna be here
         for New Year's.

782
00:39:36.842 --> 00:39:39.509
       Well, I can say no,

783
00:39:39.611 --> 00:39:41.945
   but it's just for a really
           good cause

784
00:39:42.047 --> 00:39:45.715
  and they really need someone
   with organizational skills.

785
00:39:45.817 --> 00:39:48.017
  No, I think you should do it.

786
00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:49.185
    It's good to stay engaged

787
00:39:49.287 --> 00:39:51.187
     with causes that you're
        passionate about.

788
00:39:51.289 --> 00:39:53.790
     It's like Father Young
   was saying in church today:

789
00:39:53.892 --> 00:39:56.693
  it's important to give back.

790
00:40:01.299 --> 00:40:04.100
            Hey, Mir?

791
00:40:04.202 --> 00:40:05.835
        What's going on?

792
00:40:05.937 --> 00:40:07.170
            Nothing.

793
00:40:07.272 --> 00:40:08.671
     Because you can always
           talk to me.

794
00:40:08.774 --> 00:40:10.573
       About anything. Ok?

795
00:40:10.675 --> 00:40:13.243
    I'm always here for you.

796
00:40:13.345 --> 00:40:16.579
             I know.

797
00:40:16.681 --> 00:40:18.748
      I just gotta get back
           to school.

798
00:40:24.356 --> 00:40:25.889
       ( doorbell rings )

799
00:40:27.359 --> 00:40:28.825
       Ah, there you are.

800
00:40:28.927 --> 00:40:30.827
  Sorry, my flight was delayed.

801
00:40:30.929 --> 00:40:32.929
   We gotta get you in makeup.

802
00:40:33.031 --> 00:40:35.231
      You have four scenes
          in two days,

803
00:40:35.333 --> 00:40:38.168
    and on Monday your scene
     is a great opportunity.

804
00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:39.602
   Well, I have class Monday.

805
00:40:39.704 --> 00:40:41.805
    I have to take the redeye
             Sunday.

806
00:40:41.907 --> 00:40:44.574
      Your loss. They want
        you on set in 20.

807
00:40:46.978 --> 00:40:48.311
       Turn me into Belle.

808
00:40:48.413 --> 00:40:51.014
                ♪

809
00:40:51.116 --> 00:40:53.716

00:40:59.324 --> 00:41:02.592
  That was a very good lesson.

819
00:41:25.317 --> 00:41:27.884
 I am so psyched for rush week!

820
00:41:27.986 --> 00:41:29.619
      I really want to get
         into Theta Tao.

821
00:41:29.721 --> 00:41:31.688
  They throw the best parties.

822
00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:33.089
   Are you really gonna rush?

823
00:41:33.191 --> 00:41:34.724
       It seems so brutal.

824
00:41:34.826 --> 00:41:37.093
  Well, Jeff is a legacy pledge
       because of his dad

825
00:41:37.195 --> 00:41:38.761
   so he's got a better shot.

826
00:41:38.864 --> 00:41:40.497
   Well, I still have to make
       a good impression.

827
00:41:40.599 --> 00:41:42.298
    I mean, they have to want
           you around.

828
00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:45.568
   The whole Greek thing seems
      kind of arcane to me.

829
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:47.270
         You hear that?

830
00:41:47.372 --> 00:41:48.738
         Fun is coming!

831
00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:50.139
          ( squealing )

832
00:41:50.242 --> 00:41:51.407
          Hey, Miriam.

833
00:41:53.712 --> 00:41:54.677
    Can I ask you something?

834
00:41:54.779 --> 00:41:56.613
           Yeah, sure.

835
00:41:56.715 --> 00:42:01.251
    Are you in a porn movie?

836
00:42:01.353 --> 00:42:02.986
   What're you talking about?

837
00:42:03.088 --> 00:42:04.153
         'Cause if not,
     then there's this girl

838
00:42:04.256 --> 00:42:05.555
   who looks exactly like you.

839
00:42:05.657 --> 00:42:06.823
         Like, exactly.

840
00:42:06.925 --> 00:42:10.126
  And she even sounds like you
      and, well, I mean...

841
00:42:10.228 --> 00:42:12.028
          Belle Knox...

842
00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:13.963
       it's you, isn't it?

843
00:42:17.903 --> 00:42:19.736
      I don't- I don't know
   what you're talking about.

844
00:42:19.838 --> 00:42:21.371
      I don't- I don't know
          who that is.

845
00:42:21.473 --> 00:42:22.572
 I guess I have a doppleganger.

846
00:42:22.674 --> 00:42:23.673
    So you have a twin sister

847
00:42:23.775 --> 00:42:26.509
      who is also a women's
         studies major?

848
00:42:26.611 --> 00:42:28.711
 Oh, hey, hey, don't get upset.

849
00:42:28.813 --> 00:42:30.413
   Jeff, we're friends, right?

850
00:42:30.515 --> 00:42:32.181
         Yes. Of course.

851
00:42:32.284 --> 00:42:33.683
    I need you to promise me

852
00:42:33.785 --> 00:42:35.919
      that you're not gonna
        tell anybody, ok?

853
00:42:36.021 --> 00:42:39.822
 If anybody finds out about this
        my life is over.

854
00:42:39.925 --> 00:42:41.658
             Please.

855
00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:43.927
          Ok. I won't.

856
00:42:44.029 --> 00:42:46.262
          Pinky swear.

857
00:42:46.364 --> 00:42:48.197
       Yeah. Pinky swear.

858
00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:11.988
           What's up?

859
00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:14.023
           Are you ok?

860
00:43:14.125 --> 00:43:16.092
              Yeah.

861
00:43:16.194 --> 00:43:18.161
    I'm just not really in it
       to win it tonight.

862
00:43:18.263 --> 00:43:20.296
        Ugh. I feel you.

863
00:43:20.398 --> 00:43:28.571
       Hey, Mr. Kennedy's
        talking to Jeff.

864
00:43:28.673 --> 00:43:32.875
        What do you think
     they're talking about?

865
00:43:32.978 --> 00:43:35.078
         You know what,
          I have to go.

866
00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:38.815
     Ok. I'll see you later.

867
00:43:53.465 --> 00:43:54.397
              What?

868
00:43:54.499 --> 00:43:59.335
   ( multiple notifications )

869
00:43:59.437 --> 00:44:01.771
       Hey, what's wrong?

870
00:44:01.873 --> 00:44:04.307
            Nothing.

871
00:44:04.409 --> 00:44:08.444
   I'm just... feeling really
     stressed about school.

872
00:44:08.546 --> 00:44:10.513
            It's ok.

873
00:44:10.615 --> 00:44:14.484
        Freshman year can
        be overwhelming.

874
00:44:14.586 --> 00:44:17.887
        Go back to sleep.

875
00:44:21.192 --> 00:44:22.058
( whispering ) Dude, it's early!

876
00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:23.426
          My roommates
           are asleep!

877
00:44:23.528 --> 00:44:27.463
       Did you tell them?

878
00:44:27.565 --> 00:44:28.698
            Oh, crap.

879
00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.033
        I guess something
        may have slipped.

880
00:44:30.135 --> 00:44:33.469
     Half the frats friended
         me last night.

881
00:44:33.571 --> 00:44:35.505
    I'm so sorry, Miriam. Ok?

882
00:44:35.607 --> 00:44:37.073
    I guess 'cause it's rush
     and I had been drinking

883
00:44:37.175 --> 00:44:38.608
and the guys started razzing me.

884
00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:39.742
     So they've all seen it?

885
00:44:39.844 --> 00:44:43.246
        You showed them?

886
00:44:43.348 --> 00:44:44.580
    I'm really, really sorry.

887
00:44:44.683 --> 00:44:45.415
         You should be!

888
00:44:45.517 --> 00:44:46.883
        My life is over!

889
00:44:46.985 --> 00:44:48.451
  You must have known that this
    would get out eventually!

890
00:44:48.553 --> 00:44:50.420
      It's on the internet!

891
00:44:54.392 --> 00:44:55.825
            Miriam...

892
00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:04.100
           Oh my gosh,
          did you hear?

893
00:45:04.202 --> 00:45:06.402
       There's a freshman
       who's a porn star.

894
00:45:06.504 --> 00:45:08.604
  It's all over the collegiate
              ACB.

895
00:45:16.381 --> 00:45:19.449
       Yeah, uh... I know.

896
00:45:22.921 --> 00:45:24.454
            It's me.

897
00:45:31.996 --> 00:45:34.397
        What do you mean,
            it's you?

898
00:45:34.499 --> 00:45:36.666
       I'm the porn star.

899
00:45:42.874 --> 00:45:45.374
   What are you talking about?

900
00:45:46.778 --> 00:45:48.411
        I didn't go home
        for Thanksgiving

901
00:45:48.513 --> 00:45:51.681
  and I didn't visit my friend
         at Georgetown.

902
00:45:51.783 --> 00:45:54.884
     I've been flying to LA
      to shoot porn scenes.

903
00:45:54.986 --> 00:45:57.820
           What? Why?

904
00:45:57.922 --> 00:46:01.390
 I really need to pay for school
 and you can make a lot of money

905
00:46:01.493 --> 00:46:05.862
           and we had
      kinda joked about it.

906
00:46:05.964 --> 00:46:09.932
    So you've just been lying
             to me?

907
00:46:10.034 --> 00:46:12.602
  I didn't want anyone to know.

908
00:46:12.704 --> 00:46:14.003
  I didn't want it to get out.

909
00:46:14.105 --> 00:46:15.972
  Why didn't you just tell me?

910
00:46:16.074 --> 00:46:19.976
       You have been such
         a great friend,

911
00:46:20.078 --> 00:46:25.314
 but I didn't want you to think
           less of me.

912
00:46:25.416 --> 00:46:28.551
      Listen, I don't care
          what you do.

913
00:46:28.653 --> 00:46:30.486
    As long as you don't lie
             to me.

914
00:46:30.588 --> 00:46:32.588
               Ok.

915
00:46:34.292 --> 00:46:36.659
    This person says I should
          get expelled.

916
00:46:36.761 --> 00:46:40.596
     "What a whore, her nose
    is bigger than her tits."

917
00:46:40.698 --> 00:46:44.200
         This is crazy.

918
00:46:44.302 --> 00:46:47.603
  "She should just kill herself
   and do everybody a favour."

919
00:46:47.705 --> 00:46:49.705
          "She deserves
         to get raped."

920
00:46:49.808 --> 00:46:51.374
      They're just trolls.

921
00:46:51.476 --> 00:46:53.576
     Nobody posted my name,
             right?

922
00:46:53.678 --> 00:46:54.911
               No.

923
00:46:55.013 --> 00:46:56.913
      But people are gonna
            find out.

924
00:46:57.015 --> 00:46:58.581
      You know that, right?

925
00:46:58.683 --> 00:47:00.316
     There are so many porn
      actresses out there,

926
00:47:00.418 --> 00:47:05.922
I just thought it was impossible
  for somebody to recognize me.

927
00:47:06.024 --> 00:47:07.456
 I mean, I thought I could just
       go under the radar.

928
00:47:07.559 --> 00:47:09.826
      How could I have been
           so stupid?

929
00:47:09.928 --> 00:47:12.228
   Look, there are supportive
         comments, too.

930
00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:15.298
      "Who cares? It's her
        body, not yours."

931
00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:17.033
              Look.

932
00:47:17.135 --> 00:47:19.202
        There's a message
    from a girl named Amanda.

933
00:47:19.304 --> 00:47:20.803
    Does she want to call me
          a whore, too?

934
00:47:20.905 --> 00:47:22.672
       Actually, she works
      for the school paper.

935
00:47:22.774 --> 00:47:24.207
    She wants to talk to you.

936
00:47:24.309 --> 00:47:25.975
             Uh, no.

937
00:47:26.077 --> 00:47:28.711
       I think it might be
          a good idea.

938
00:47:28.813 --> 00:47:31.547
        You don't deserve
         to be harassed.

939
00:47:37.355 --> 00:47:38.454
               Hi.

940
00:47:38.556 --> 00:47:39.388
        Uh... I'm Miriam.

941
00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:41.157
       Amanda. Wanna sit?

942
00:47:44.929 --> 00:47:46.028
    I don't know about this.

943
00:47:46.130 --> 00:47:47.029
            I get it.

944
00:47:47.131 --> 00:47:48.464
       Gossip spreads fast
           on campus.

945
00:47:48.566 --> 00:47:49.832
  It's only gonna get rougher,
              too.

946
00:47:49.934 --> 00:47:51.167
             Right.

947
00:47:51.269 --> 00:47:52.635
    And some of the frats and
    sororities know who I am,

948
00:47:52.737 --> 00:47:54.904
        but my name isn't
       totally out there.

949
00:47:55.006 --> 00:47:57.473
 For the purposes of my article
       I can use an alias.

950
00:47:57.575 --> 00:47:58.641
         Whatever you're
        comfortable with.

951
00:47:58.743 --> 00:48:02.278
    And I promise to be fair.

952
00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:03.813
       I just don't know.

953
00:48:03.915 --> 00:48:07.316
       This is your chance
       to tell your side.

954
00:48:07.418 --> 00:48:09.252
     Don't you want to make
            lemonade?

955
00:48:13.958 --> 00:48:19.295
   You know, the guy who outed
  me was watching hardcore porn

956
00:48:19.397 --> 00:48:23.099
       and yet I'm the one
   who's being called a slut.

957
00:48:23.201 --> 00:48:25.768
    Because somehow creating
  the content is more shameful

958
00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:27.870
       than consuming it?

959
00:48:27.972 --> 00:48:29.906
     It's a double standard.

960
00:48:30.008 --> 00:48:33.876
     So doing porn, for you,
       is a feminist act?

961
00:48:34.979 --> 00:48:35.611
         Yeah, in a way.

962
00:48:35.713 --> 00:48:36.512
  Is that why you're doing it?

963
00:48:36.614 --> 00:48:38.347
      I'm doing it because
          I need money.

964
00:48:38.449 --> 00:48:42.118
   My parents can't afford the
 $60,000 a year tuition at Duke

965
00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:44.987
     and I don't want to be
in debt for the rest of my life.

966
00:48:45.089 --> 00:48:46.422
     I mean, if I waitressed
            part-time

967
00:48:46.524 --> 00:48:51.527
I would maybe make $400 a month,
       and it's degrading.

968
00:48:51.629 --> 00:48:55.097
 You don't find porn degrading?

969
00:48:55.199 --> 00:48:58.901
   Actually, it's empowering.

970
00:48:59.003 --> 00:49:02.405
  I get to have this alter-ego.

971
00:49:02.507 --> 00:49:06.442
    It's like Miriam is this
  serious, studious, nerdy girl

972
00:49:06.544 --> 00:49:12.415
  and then Belle is this sexy,
 mischievous, uninhibited minx.

973
00:49:12.517 --> 00:49:15.651
    Yeah, but... aren't most
      of the directors men?

974
00:49:15.753 --> 00:49:17.453
      And then the way that
     these women are shown,

975
00:49:17.555 --> 00:49:20.823
  usually helpless, disposable
            sex toys

976
00:49:20.925 --> 00:49:23.426
that exist only to pleasure men.

977
00:49:23.528 --> 00:49:26.996
       It's true, a lot of
     the directors are men.

978
00:49:27.098 --> 00:49:29.665
       But maybe it's time
       that that changed.

979
00:49:29.767 --> 00:49:31.801
 And there's a lot of different
          kinds of porn

980
00:49:31.903 --> 00:49:33.736
      for different sexual
          preferences.

981
00:49:33.838 --> 00:49:35.638
    You know, a lot of women,
        myself included,

982
00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:39.608
  are really turned on by BDSM
     and sexual domination.

983
00:49:39.711 --> 00:49:43.879
  My sexual preference doesn't
   make me any less feminist.

984
00:49:48.419 --> 00:49:50.653
   They're all looking at me.

985
00:49:50.755 --> 00:49:52.488
      You think they know?

986
00:49:52.590 --> 00:49:54.924
     Yeah. They're laughing.

987
00:49:55.026 --> 00:49:58.828
     It's like I'm wearing a
  scarlet letter or something.

988
00:49:58.930 --> 00:50:01.664
 So what do your parents think?

989
00:50:01.766 --> 00:50:05.034
  Oh, no. They can't find out.

990
00:50:05.136 --> 00:50:08.137
     They're really Catholic
     and really conservative

991
00:50:08.239 --> 00:50:11.273
   and I know that they would
         just freak out.

992
00:50:11.376 --> 00:50:13.142
      I mean, my mom would
       probably disown me.

993
00:50:13.244 --> 00:50:16.545
 They still think I'm a virgin.

994
00:50:16.647 --> 00:50:18.581
     I have to get to class.

995
00:50:18.683 --> 00:50:21.650
 Ok. Thanks for talking with me.

996
00:50:21.753 --> 00:50:23.619
         No, thank you.

997
00:50:23.721 --> 00:50:26.756
   I'm really looking forward
        to your article.

998
00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:44.040
              Slut.

999
00:52:04.188 --> 00:52:07.289
    Thank you for being here
             for me.

1000
00:52:07.391 --> 00:52:09.258
     It really means a lot.

1001
00:52:11.729 --> 00:52:13.829
    I don't have anyone else
           to talk to.

1002
00:52:13.931 --> 00:52:15.631
        Girl, I got you.

1003
00:52:15.733 --> 00:52:17.933
    Everything's gonna be ok.

1004
00:52:18.035 --> 00:52:20.636
   You can't let a few a-holes
           get to you.

1005
00:52:25.610 --> 00:52:27.042
           Hi ladies.

1006
00:52:27.145 --> 00:52:30.312
 What brings you to the women's
          centre today?

1007
00:52:30.414 --> 00:52:33.949
       Last week somebody
    put this sign on my door.

1008
00:52:34.051 --> 00:52:37.052
   This morning I got a death
 threat on my Facebook account.

1009
00:52:37.155 --> 00:52:39.522
       The messages I get
           are awful.

1010
00:52:39.624 --> 00:52:42.158
   That I should kill myself,
     I should get expelled.

1011
00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:44.460
     I've had garbage thrown
             at me.

1012
00:52:44.562 --> 00:52:45.728
    I don't know what to do.

1013
00:52:45.830 --> 00:52:47.630
   I'm sorry this is happening
             to you.

1014
00:52:47.732 --> 00:52:49.465
        We are 100 percent here
            to support you

1015
00:52:49.567 --> 00:52:52.067
   and the university is here
   to support you as well, ok?

1016
00:52:52.170 --> 00:52:54.270
         We have a zero
        tolerance policy

1017
00:52:54.372 --> 00:52:56.172
   when it comes to this type
         of harassment-

1018
00:52:56.274 --> 00:52:58.574
  And it's not just one person,
             either.

1019
00:52:58.676 --> 00:53:00.309
   Would you like me to speak
   to the resident's advisor?

1020
00:53:00.411 --> 00:53:02.311
    We could see about moving
           your room?

1021
00:53:02.413 --> 00:53:04.180
 Maybe to a non-co-ed building.

1022
00:53:04.282 --> 00:53:06.549
        No, I love being
        Jolie's roommate.

1023
00:53:06.651 --> 00:53:09.685
   Ok, well that is an option
    if you change your mind.

1024
00:53:09.787 --> 00:53:12.555
   So there's no way I'll get
  kicked out of school, right?

1025
00:53:12.657 --> 00:53:14.757
     No, no. Absolutely not.

1026
00:53:14.859 --> 00:53:17.993
      Just so you know, our
 perspective is that what you do

1027
00:53:18.095 --> 00:53:20.629
    in your own time and how
  you choose to make a living,

1028
00:53:20.731 --> 00:53:24.366
     as long as it's legal,
    is entirely your choice.

1029
00:53:24.468 --> 00:53:26.869
         We do not pass
         judgment here.

1030
00:53:29.574 --> 00:53:31.307
 I really hope you come forward
        with a complaint

1031
00:53:31.409 --> 00:53:33.842
        and we can figure
       this out together.

1032
00:53:33.945 --> 00:53:36.011
 Well, I'm not ready to do that.

1033
00:53:36.113 --> 00:53:38.547
        At least not yet.

1034
00:53:42.620 --> 00:53:44.086
       Thank you so much.

1035
00:53:44.188 --> 00:53:45.821
   You've been super helpful.

1036
00:53:45.923 --> 00:53:48.991
      Yeah, I actually feel
        a little better.

1037
00:53:49.093 --> 00:53:50.359
         Good, I'm glad.

1038
00:53:50.461 --> 00:53:52.695
 I really think you should reach
       out to your family.

1039
00:53:52.797 --> 00:53:54.363
       It can be difficult
         being isolated

1040
00:53:54.465 --> 00:53:55.864
  and if you're feeling bullied

1041
00:53:55.967 --> 00:53:59.501
  it's incredibly important you
 have a strong support network.

1042
00:53:59.604 --> 00:54:00.903
      <i> The stress of trying</i>
        <i> to keep a secret</i>

1043
00:54:01.005 --> 00:54:03.839

       <i> than coming clean.</i>

1044

1045
00:54:10.581 --> 00:54:12.248
            You guys?

1046
00:54:12.350 --> 00:54:14.416
   The article got published.

1047
00:54:20.458 --> 00:54:21.991
      Amanda totally lied.

1048
00:54:22.093 --> 00:54:23.425
     She said she'd be fair.

1049
00:54:23.527 --> 00:54:26.028
   She gave you an alias like
       she said she would.

1050
00:54:26.130 --> 00:54:28.197
    "Missy makes a compelling
            argument.

1051
00:54:28.299 --> 00:54:30.065
    "I'm a feminist and to me
    that means taking agency

1052
00:54:30.167 --> 00:54:32.134
    "over my personal liberty
     and my right to choose

1053
00:54:32.236 --> 00:54:33.636
   "what to do with my body."

1054
00:54:33.738 --> 00:54:35.104
   This is really flattering.

1055
00:54:35.206 --> 00:54:36.872
       I don't understand
      why you're so upset.

1056
00:54:36.974 --> 00:54:38.974
     She makes me sound like
      I contradict myself.

1057
00:54:39.076 --> 00:54:40.876
   Then she says I'm insecure
  and that makes me sound like

1058
00:54:40.978 --> 00:54:44.413
    I'm some first-year woman
 seeking approval or something.

1059
00:54:44.515 --> 00:54:46.548
   She said to make lemonade.

1060
00:54:46.651 --> 00:54:47.783
          I don't know.

1061
00:54:47.885 --> 00:54:49.485
  I thought she made you sound
          pretty good.

1062
00:54:49.587 --> 00:54:51.620
  Well, I'm not some insecure,
        first-year woman.

1063
00:54:51.722 --> 00:54:53.289
   She reduced me to a cliché.

1064
00:54:53.391 --> 00:54:55.457
    I think she made you seem
          really human.

1065
00:54:55.559 --> 00:54:56.759
         And vulnerable.

1066
00:54:56.861 --> 00:54:58.460
       I don't want pity.

1067
00:54:58.562 --> 00:55:01.530
   I want people to understand
 that this is about empowerment.

1068
00:55:01.632 --> 00:55:02.531
        I get that, but-

1069
00:55:02.633 --> 00:55:03.832
         You know what?

1070
00:55:03.934 --> 00:55:05.401
Let's go to The Foundry tonight.

1071
00:55:05.503 --> 00:55:06.502
       I need to get out.

1072
00:55:06.604 --> 00:55:08.037
             Really?

1073
00:55:16.747 --> 00:55:17.579
             Oh no.

1074
00:55:17.682 --> 00:55:19.615
        Look who's here.

1075
00:55:22.219 --> 00:55:23.185
           It's fine.

1076
00:55:23.287 --> 00:55:25.454
            I'm fine.

1077
00:55:25.556 --> 00:55:27.256
             Really.

1078
00:55:31.762 --> 00:55:33.195
              Hey.

1079
00:55:33.297 --> 00:55:35.431
             Oh, hi.

1080
00:55:35.533 --> 00:55:36.965
        How're you doing?

1081
00:55:37.068 --> 00:55:38.801
   Pretty good. How about you?

1082
00:55:38.903 --> 00:55:40.069
          I'm all good.

1083
00:55:40.171 --> 00:55:42.805
    What're you doing later?

1084
00:55:42.907 --> 00:55:45.341
       Uh... I don't know.

1085
00:55:45.443 --> 00:55:47.042
       You wanna hang out?

1086
00:55:47.144 --> 00:55:48.944
        Yeah, that would-
     that would be awesome.

1087
00:55:49.046 --> 00:55:50.245
              Cool.

1088
00:55:50.348 --> 00:55:51.947
    So you wanna meet me and
  my buddies back at the dorm?

1089
00:55:54.251 --> 00:55:56.385
          What buddies?

1090
00:55:56.487 --> 00:55:57.720
           ( laughs )

1091
00:55:57.822 --> 00:55:59.388
  Come on, Belle. It'll be fun.

1092
00:55:59.490 --> 00:56:01.390
       We can make a video
           of our own.

1093
00:56:01.492 --> 00:56:04.593
         I mean, that's-
    that's your thing, right?

1094
00:56:10.901 --> 00:56:14.570
          ( knocking )

1095
00:56:14.672 --> 00:56:16.205
      <i> ( Guy ): Hey, slut!</i>

1096
00:56:16.307 --> 00:56:18.140
  <i> ( Gu</i> y 2<i> ): Hey Belle, wanna</i>
              <i> make</i>
            <i> a movie?</i>

1097
00:56:18.242 --> 00:56:20.642
     <i> ( Guy ): Come on out,</i>
     <i> we know you're horny!</i>

1098
00:56:20.745 --> 00:56:21.910
              Hey!

1099
00:56:22.012 --> 00:56:23.812
       Campus security is
           on its way!

1100
00:56:23.914 --> 00:56:25.681
   You better get out of here!

1101
00:56:27.351 --> 00:56:29.985
    What am I supposed to do?

1102
00:56:33.491 --> 00:56:35.224
          They're gone.

1103
00:56:35.326 --> 00:56:37.459
   But they're not gonna stop.

1104
00:56:37.561 --> 00:56:39.695
    And my name's not Belle,
          it's Miriam.

1105
00:56:39.797 --> 00:56:42.598
It's fantasy! She's a character!

1106
00:56:44.902 --> 00:56:46.135
      Excuse me, professor.

1107
00:56:46.237 --> 00:56:49.371
        I have a question
        about my thesis.

1108
00:56:50.574 --> 00:56:51.507
         No. No, no, no.

1109
00:56:51.609 --> 00:56:52.174
           I'm sorry.

1110
00:56:52.276 --> 00:56:53.442
              Don?

1111
00:56:53.544 --> 00:56:55.043
       What's the problem?

1112
00:56:55.146 --> 00:56:57.813
  I was not told that the actor
       would be, like, 50.

1113
00:56:57.915 --> 00:56:59.848
   I've been super clear that
  I don't wanna book any scenes

1114
00:56:59.950 --> 00:57:02.284
    with any co-star over 35.

1115
00:57:02.386 --> 00:57:03.152
        You were serious?

1116
00:57:03.254 --> 00:57:04.420
              Yes.

1117
00:57:04.522 --> 00:57:05.754
       Well, I apologize,
    it'll never happen again.

1118
00:57:05.856 --> 00:57:07.356
      But the crew is here
   and they're ready to work.

1119
00:57:07.458 --> 00:57:09.291
            Let's go.

1120
00:57:09.393 --> 00:57:11.360
 I'm not comfortable with this.

1121
00:57:11.462 --> 00:57:13.362
    If you don't do the scene
 you'll be labeled "difficult".

1122
00:57:13.464 --> 00:57:15.898
         It's your call.

1123
00:57:18.235 --> 00:57:20.636
       That's a good girl.

1124
00:57:24.241 --> 00:57:26.074
          <i> And action.</i>

1125
00:57:26.177 --> 00:57:27.409
      Excuse me, professor?

1126
00:57:27.511 --> 00:57:31.880
        I have a question
        about my thesis.

1127
00:57:31.982 --> 00:57:34.516
           ( moaning )

1128
00:57:34.618 --> 00:57:35.484
            Oh, yes!

1129
00:57:35.586 --> 00:57:36.552
         Oh yeah, baby!

1130
00:57:36.654 --> 00:57:37.686
        Oh, right there.

1131
00:57:37.788 --> 00:57:38.454
           Don't stop.

1132
00:57:38.556 --> 00:57:39.421
              Yes!

1133
00:57:39.523 --> 00:57:41.056
           ( moaning )

1134
00:57:41.158 --> 00:57:42.791
              <i> Cut!</i>

1135
00:58:01.378 --> 00:58:04.346
        They're not ready
        for my scene yet.

1136
00:58:04.448 --> 00:58:06.048
     You're studying again?

1137
00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:07.249
          How's school?

1138
00:58:07.351 --> 00:58:09.284
       I have so much work
     to do over the weekend.

1139
00:58:09.386 --> 00:58:13.455
 And honestly I'm having a hard
 time concentrating on anything.

1140
00:58:13.557 --> 00:58:17.493
 Now that I got outed on campus
    it has been so stressful.

1141
00:58:17.595 --> 00:58:19.695
         Did you talk to
        your parents yet?

1142
00:58:19.797 --> 00:58:21.563
          No, I can't.

1143
00:58:21.665 --> 00:58:23.732
          You have to.
     They're gonna find out.

1144
00:58:23.834 --> 00:58:25.834
  What if they never wanna talk
          to me again?

1145
00:58:25.936 --> 00:58:28.871
   No matter what, it's better
     that it comes from you.

1146
00:58:28.973 --> 00:58:30.105
           Just do it.

1147
00:58:30.207 --> 00:58:31.974
    If you're afraid to call
          you can text.

1148
00:58:32.076 --> 00:58:33.675
       Does your mom text?

1149
00:58:33.777 --> 00:58:37.346
        It's like pulling
         a Band-Aid off.

1150
00:58:47.691 --> 00:58:50.859
        It's gonna be ok.

1151
00:58:50.961 --> 00:58:53.695
     I don't know if it is.

1152
00:59:01.805 --> 00:59:02.971
         ( phone rings )

1153
00:59:03.073 --> 00:59:04.172
          What do I do?

1154
00:59:04.275 --> 00:59:06.041
  It's ok. Take a deep breath.

1155
00:59:07.978 --> 00:59:10.145
        You can do this.

1156
00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:17.119
              Mom?

1157
00:59:17.221 --> 00:59:18.987
      <i> Miriam, what are you</i>
         <i> talking about?</i>

1158
00:59:19.089 --> 00:59:21.890
      <i> What does this text</i>
           <i> even mean?</i>

1159
00:59:21.992 --> 00:59:27.663
   Mom, um... I wasn't selling
       pot last semester.

1160
00:59:27.765 --> 00:59:29.798
   I was filming adult videos.

1161
00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:32.200
       <i> What? Pornography?</i>

1162
00:59:34.138 --> 00:59:35.671
    No, you can't be serious.

1163
00:59:35.773 --> 00:59:38.907
       Well, I mean, porn
       is just a business

1164
00:59:39.009 --> 00:59:40.776
     and it's an honest job.

1165
00:59:40.878 --> 00:59:42.210
     What are you thinking?

1166
00:59:42.313 --> 00:59:44.780
   I knew that you and dad had
enough financial pressure on you

1167
00:59:44.882 --> 00:59:47.683
     and I didn't wanna add
         to your stress.

1168
00:59:47.785 --> 00:59:50.252
        Mom, believe me,
       it's gonna be fine.

1169
00:59:50.354 --> 00:59:52.955
  <i> No, it's not gonna be fine.</i>

1170
00:59:53.057 --> 00:59:56.124
       <i> Do you understand</i>
       <i> what you've done?</i>

1171
00:59:56.226 --> 00:59:59.261
       All the hard work,
    all your accomplishments?

1172
00:59:59.363 --> 01:00:01.163
       <i> You've just thrown</i>
           <i> them away!</i>

1173
01:00:01.265 --> 01:00:03.665
           ( sobbing )

1174
01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:08.036
  I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

1175
01:00:08.138 --> 01:00:10.339
         <i> I've gotta go.</i>

1176
01:00:10.441 --> 01:00:16.845
           ( sobbing )

1177
01:00:18.616 --> 01:00:19.815
  Giles is an all-women's hall

1178
01:00:19.917 --> 01:00:22.351
      so hopefully it'll be
      a little more quiet.

1179
01:00:22.453 --> 01:00:25.320
    I hope so. I hate moving.

1180
01:00:28.425 --> 01:00:30.058
       I'm gonna miss you.

1181
01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:33.629
       Hello, I'll be over
          all the time.

1182
01:00:33.731 --> 01:00:35.797
             Skank.

1183
01:00:35.899 --> 01:00:37.499
          ( laughing )

1184
01:00:37.601 --> 01:00:39.835
          Ignore them.

1185
01:00:39.937 --> 01:00:41.737
       No. You know what?

1186
01:00:41.839 --> 01:00:44.606
   I'm not gonna ignore them.

1187
01:00:44.708 --> 01:00:46.174
      Hey, what'd you say?

1188
01:00:46.276 --> 01:00:47.242
            Nothing.

1189
01:00:47.344 --> 01:00:48.377
   No, actually you called me
             a skank

1190
01:00:48.479 --> 01:00:50.078
    but now you're not gonna
       say it to my face.

1191
01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:51.413
      You don't have to get
           all psycho.

1192
01:00:51.515 --> 01:00:53.682
     Wow. Psycho and skank?

1193
01:00:53.784 --> 01:00:55.317
    Because that's what women
      who speak their minds

1194
01:00:55.419 --> 01:00:57.853
    and make decisions about
  their own bodies are, right?

1195
01:00:57.955 --> 01:00:59.254
 But you're, like, doing people
           for money.

1196
01:00:59.356 --> 01:01:00.722
   I mean, it's embarrassing.

1197
01:01:00.824 --> 01:01:02.090
        I made a choice.

1198
01:01:02.192 --> 01:01:03.525
You don't have to agree with it,

1199
01:01:03.627 --> 01:01:05.494
 but the fact you fell the need
   to discriminate against me

1200
01:01:05.596 --> 01:01:08.597
   and shame me is really sad.

1201
01:01:12.903 --> 01:01:14.436
          Good for you.

1202
01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:18.306
            Come on.

1203
01:01:18.409 --> 01:01:19.374
        ( phone ringing )

1204
01:01:19.476 --> 01:01:21.243
          Oh, hold on.
      I'll be right there.

1205
01:01:24.314 --> 01:01:25.447
             Hello?

1206
01:01:25.549 --> 01:01:26.515
 <i> Can I speak with Miriam Weeks</i>
            <i> please.</i>

1207
01:01:26.617 --> 01:01:28.550
          This is she.

1208
01:01:30.421 --> 01:01:32.320
              Hey.

1209
01:01:32.423 --> 01:01:36.258
     So... that was someone
            from CNN.

1210
01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:37.859
   They want to interview me.

1211
01:01:37.961 --> 01:01:39.227
             Really?

1212
01:01:39.329 --> 01:01:41.697
    I think I'm gonna do it.

1213
01:01:47.271 --> 01:01:49.171
 My next guest was just another
   student at Duke University.

1214
01:01:49.273 --> 01:01:52.240
    Now she's known as Belle
  Knox and she's acting in porn

1215
01:01:52.342 --> 01:01:53.475
       to pay her tuition.

1216
01:01:53.577 --> 01:01:55.243
   You are probably right now
         pound-for-pound

1217
01:01:55.345 --> 01:01:57.813
    the most infamous student
           in America.

1218
01:01:57.915 --> 01:01:59.047
   How do you feel about that?

1219
01:01:59.149 --> 01:02:01.283
      It's totally surreal.

1220
01:02:01.385 --> 01:02:04.052
   I mean, suddenly all these
     strangers know who I am

1221
01:02:04.154 --> 01:02:05.887
  and have an opinion about me.

1222
01:02:05.989 --> 01:02:07.956
       I could have never
         imagined this.

1223
01:02:08.058 --> 01:02:10.459
    As a feminist, as a woman
       in women's studies,

1224
01:02:10.561 --> 01:02:13.695
      taking part in porno-
       pornographic scenes

1225
01:02:13.797 --> 01:02:15.397
   sort of puts uncomfortable,

1226
01:02:15.499 --> 01:02:17.933
     unnecessary stereotypes
        about there for-

1227
01:02:18.035 --> 01:02:20.335
   for lots of men to think is
            the norm.

1228
01:02:20.437 --> 01:02:23.939
  To me, feminism is not about
  acting masculine or feminine,

1229
01:02:24.041 --> 01:02:27.142
   it's about having the right
  to act in any way we choose.

1230
01:02:27.244 --> 01:02:28.643
  There will be lots of people
          watching this

1231
01:02:28.746 --> 01:02:32.714
  who will be feigning outrage
       and yet, secretly,

1232
01:02:32.816 --> 01:02:36.017
    probably looking at porn
   quite regularly themselves.

1233
01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:37.786
Do you think there's a hypocrisy

1234
01:02:37.888 --> 01:02:40.722
  in the way that people treat
     pornography in America?

1235
01:02:40.824 --> 01:02:42.190
           Of course.

1236
01:02:42.292 --> 01:02:44.993
   You know, something like 80
  percent of all online traffic

1237
01:02:45.095 --> 01:02:46.261
       goes to porn sites.

1238
01:02:46.363 --> 01:02:47.863
She's only eighteen or nineteen,

1239
01:02:47.965 --> 01:02:50.565
   so I think we underestimate
         how, you know,

1240
01:02:50.667 --> 01:02:52.167
   immature and naive she is.

1241
01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:53.568
          <i> Definitely.</i>

1242
01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:55.203
 We like to say that, you know,
      porn is ok, whatever,

1243
01:02:55.305 --> 01:02:56.271
        it's just a job.

1244
01:02:56.373 --> 01:02:57.539
   Maybe she doesn't identify
            with it.

1245
01:02:57.641 --> 01:02:59.107
    She probably thought that
     I'm gonna go out there,

1246
01:02:59.209 --> 01:03:01.610
    do this, it's just a job,
       it's not who I am-

1247
01:03:01.712 --> 01:03:04.346
  I think you're right, and...
             but...

1248
01:03:04.448 --> 01:03:06.214
     also, you gotta own up
     to what you do though.

1249
01:03:06.316 --> 01:03:07.849
  Because at some point it can
       become who you are.

1250
01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:10.051
 If I'm honest, I've got a young
      daughter, very young,

1251
01:03:10.154 --> 01:03:12.254
 only two years old, but if she,
      when she is your age,

1252
01:03:12.356 --> 01:03:16.091
 decided to do this, I would be
   pretty upset as her father.

1253
01:03:16.193 --> 01:03:17.459
           ( laughs )

1254
01:03:17.561 --> 01:03:19.261
   I think the important thing
           is whether

1255
01:03:19.363 --> 01:03:21.363
     the person is doing it
           by choice.

1256
01:03:21.465 --> 01:03:22.631
      If you have a choice

1257
01:03:22.733 --> 01:03:25.367
     I don't see why anyone
      would have a problem.

1258
01:03:25.469 --> 01:03:27.469
     <i> The choice for me felt</i>
        <i> really natural.</i>

1259
01:03:27.571 --> 01:03:29.838
      I've always been very
  comfortable with my sexuality

1260
01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:32.541
   and I've been watching porn
  since I was twelve years old.

1261
01:03:32.643 --> 01:03:33.708
        ( crowd murmurs )

1262
01:03:33.811 --> 01:03:35.243
    You know, you're a guest
          on our show,

1263
01:03:35.345 --> 01:03:36.311
    I don't- I don't want to
 make you feel any kind of bad,

1264
01:03:36.413 --> 01:03:37.679
     it just... for someone
           to say that

1265
01:03:37.781 --> 01:03:39.381
 "I've been watching porn since
     I was twelve years old,

1266
01:03:39.483 --> 01:03:40.849
      "and it empowers me",

1267
01:03:40.951 --> 01:03:43.318
  to me it sounds like you have
 something completely memorized,

1268
01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:44.519
     uh, that you're saying.

1269
01:03:44.621 --> 01:03:46.087
    I just- my heart breaks.

1270
01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:47.055
         It really does.

1271
01:03:47.157 --> 01:03:48.490
        ( crowd cheers )

1272
01:03:48.592 --> 01:03:50.659
    Are you getting hostility
       from men or women?

1273
01:03:50.761 --> 01:03:52.727
   Definitely more from women.

1274
01:03:52.830 --> 01:03:55.664
       I can't even go out
     without being harassed.

1275
01:03:55.766 --> 01:03:58.266
  <i> I think a lot of women feel</i>
  <i> insecure having a porn star</i>

1276
01:03:58.368 --> 01:04:01.469
      on campus and they're
          probably mad

1277
01:04:01.572 --> 01:04:04.573
    because their boyfriends
     are watching my stuff.

1278
01:04:04.675 --> 01:04:06.708
  Did she really just say that?

1279
01:04:06.810 --> 01:04:08.610
         What about us?

1280
01:04:08.712 --> 01:04:11.513
  We've totally supported her.

1281
01:04:15.485 --> 01:04:16.618
          ( knocking )

1282
01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:18.153
            Come in.

1283
01:04:20.057 --> 01:04:21.456
              Hey!

1284
01:04:21.558 --> 01:04:23.425
    Did you see Piers Morgan
           yesterday?

1285
01:04:23.527 --> 01:04:25.193
        He was so brutal.

1286
01:04:25.295 --> 01:04:27.162
  That's what I wanted to talk
          to you about.

1287
01:04:27.264 --> 01:04:28.897
  You really rubbed some people
          the wrong way

1288
01:04:28.999 --> 01:04:32.100
  when you said women on campus
       don't support you.

1289
01:04:32.202 --> 01:04:34.669
  Oh, that's not what I meant.

1290
01:04:34.771 --> 01:04:36.438
      Well, that's what it
          sounded like.

1291
01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:39.841
  You have an entire community
  of women rallied behind you.

1292
01:04:39.943 --> 01:04:41.409
   I mean, maybe that doesn't
       work for the story,

1293
01:04:41.511 --> 01:04:43.845
     but I just don't think
          that's cool.

1294
01:04:43.947 --> 01:04:47.282
    Jolie, that's really not
         how I meant it.

1295
01:04:47.384 --> 01:04:49.050
 I guess I just wasn't thinking.

1296
01:04:49.152 --> 01:04:52.454
 Well, if you're gonna be saying
 stuff on TV you need to think.

1297
01:04:52.556 --> 01:04:55.557
    You can't just say stuff
           like that.

1298
01:04:55.659 --> 01:04:57.492
   It's ok, I'll get over it.

1299
01:04:57.594 --> 01:04:59.995
   I just wanted you to know.

1300
01:05:00.097 --> 01:05:02.931
               Ok.

1301
01:05:03.033 --> 01:05:04.699
   Are you going to do another
           interview?

1302
01:05:04.801 --> 01:05:09.638
       No, I'm going home.

1303
01:05:17.481 --> 01:05:18.780
            ( sighs )

1304
01:05:46.543 --> 01:05:48.143
    We just don't understand.

1305
01:05:48.245 --> 01:05:49.678
   Why didn't you come to us?

1306
01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:51.846
   I knew you guys didn't have
           the money.

1307
01:05:56.019 --> 01:06:02.090
You will always be our daughter,
    and we love you, Miriam.

1308
01:06:02.192 --> 01:06:05.860
      But I'm heartbroken.

1309
01:06:05.963 --> 01:06:08.196
I just don't think you've really
         thought through

1310
01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:12.968
   what this is going to mean
   for the rest of your life.

1311
01:06:13.070 --> 01:06:16.671
  I know what I'm doing, daddy.

1312
01:06:16.773 --> 01:06:19.074
             Do you?

1313
01:06:24.314 --> 01:06:26.181
              Paul.

1314
01:06:30.854 --> 01:06:31.586
           Paul, wait!

1315
01:06:31.688 --> 01:06:32.854
      Where are you going?

1316
01:06:32.956 --> 01:06:34.489
  I have nothing to say to you.

1317
01:06:38.628 --> 01:06:40.795
            Paulie...

1318
01:06:50.007 --> 01:06:52.440
    So you sell these panties
          to old dudes?

1319
01:06:52.542 --> 01:06:55.310
     Well, the fans buy them
    when you sign autographs

1320
01:06:55.412 --> 01:06:57.178
      at these conventions.

1321
01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:00.982
  They'll pay, like, 50 bucks,
              so...

1322
01:07:01.084 --> 01:07:04.252
           Wow, weird.

1323
01:07:04.354 --> 01:07:10.191
    It's all part of building
     my brand, or whatever.

1324
01:07:10.293 --> 01:07:12.761
      I can't believe Paul
        won't talk to me.

1325
01:07:12.863 --> 01:07:14.796
         Give him time.

1326
01:07:14.898 --> 01:07:17.165
 Well, it's really just unfair.

1327
01:07:17.267 --> 01:07:19.167
     How did you expect them
            to react?

1328
01:07:19.269 --> 01:07:21.269
      They're conservative
          and Catholic.

1329
01:07:21.371 --> 01:07:23.471
  And you're their little girl.

1330
01:07:23.573 --> 01:07:25.440
 I just wanted a little support.

1331
01:07:25.542 --> 01:07:29.811
     Well, they have a right
     to their feelings, too.

1332
01:07:29.913 --> 01:07:31.780
        How do you feel?

1333
01:07:31.882 --> 01:07:35.917
       I mean... when were
       you gonna tell me?

1334
01:07:36.019 --> 01:07:38.086
     We've known each other
        our entire lives,

1335
01:07:38.188 --> 01:07:41.956
   and I kinda feel like I was
    the last person to know.

1336
01:07:42.059 --> 01:07:47.228
     I really wanted to tell
           you, but...

1337
01:07:47.330 --> 01:07:51.966
I guess I thought that if anyone
    back here knew about it,

1338
01:07:52.069 --> 01:07:54.636
     it would make it real.

1339
01:07:54.738 --> 01:07:56.971
    You can't keep the truth
   from me like that anymore.

1340
01:07:57.074 --> 01:07:58.073
       We're best friends.

1341
01:07:58.175 --> 01:08:01.042
        I know. I won't.

1342
01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:11.486
      How often do you have
         to get tested?

1343
01:08:11.588 --> 01:08:13.855
        Every two weeks.

1344
01:08:13.957 --> 01:08:17.559
   I have to do it to be able
         to film scenes.

1345
01:08:17.661 --> 01:08:19.194
         Isn't it scary?

1346
01:08:19.296 --> 01:08:21.996
    I mean, aren't you afraid
   you're gonna get something?

1347
01:08:22.099 --> 01:08:24.265
     Well, yeah, of course.

1348
01:08:24.367 --> 01:08:26.401
       But everyone tests,

1349
01:08:26.503 --> 01:08:29.938
  so it's safer than hooking up
      with guys at school.

1350
01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:33.341
     And it's a lot more fun
    because it's on my terms.

1351
01:08:33.443 --> 01:08:35.110
    Do you really think that?

1352
01:08:35.212 --> 01:08:36.744
           Yeah, I do.

1353
01:08:36.847 --> 01:08:40.348
  I mean, when I'm in porn land
        I feel welcomed.

1354
01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:43.418
    Like those are my peers.

1355
01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:46.821
  You can be whatever you want
    and you won't get judged.

1356
01:08:46.923 --> 01:08:49.657
  At school everyone judges me
            and they-

1357
01:08:49.759 --> 01:08:52.594
  they put me into categories.

1358
01:08:52.696 --> 01:08:58.199
      It's empowering to be
        who I want to be.

1359
01:08:58.301 --> 01:09:00.602
       You're really good
     at crafting arguments.

1360
01:09:00.704 --> 01:09:03.872
   I've seen you making cases
      on the debate stage,

1361
01:09:03.974 --> 01:09:07.542
    I saw you doing it again
         on talk shows.

1362
01:09:07.644 --> 01:09:10.278
  But you're not on a talk show
           right now.

1363
01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:13.348
      You're talking to me.

1364
01:09:13.450 --> 01:09:16.384
  And I feel like you're trying
    to sell me on something.

1365
01:09:16.486 --> 01:09:18.953
I mean, if you feel so empowered

1366
01:09:19.055 --> 01:09:21.956
      and if you love what
      you're doing so much,

1367
01:09:22.058 --> 01:09:25.894
         why do you seem
           so unhappy?

1368
01:09:31.902 --> 01:09:33.535
            Love you.

1369
01:09:33.637 --> 01:09:35.103
        I love you, too.

1370
01:09:35.205 --> 01:09:39.440
    Will you please tell Paul
 that I love him and I miss him?

1371
01:09:39.543 --> 01:09:41.509
             I will.

1372
01:10:01.031 --> 01:10:02.330
      Going to the airport?

1373
01:10:02.432 --> 01:10:04.065
              Yep.

1374
01:10:04.167 --> 01:10:07.068
      Where are you headed?

1375
01:10:07.170 --> 01:10:08.303
             Vegas.

1376
01:10:08.405 --> 01:10:09.938
          Vegas, baby.

1377
01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:13.374
      Man, that's my town.

1378
01:10:13.476 --> 01:10:15.276
      What's the occasion?

1379
01:10:15.378 --> 01:10:17.378
       Bachelorette party.

1380
01:10:19.716 --> 01:10:20.782
       Better be careful.

1381
01:10:20.884 --> 01:10:23.284
     People get pretty wild
       and crazy in Vegas.

1382
01:10:23.386 --> 01:10:24.052
           Hey, wait.

1383
01:10:24.154 --> 01:10:25.320
        You're that girl.

1384
01:10:25.422 --> 01:10:27.121
 You're that porn girl that went
        to Fernwood Prep.

1385
01:10:27.224 --> 01:10:29.857
  I got a celebrity in my car.

1386
01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:32.026
       Oh, yeah, I guess.

1387
01:10:32.128 --> 01:10:33.661
     What's your name again?

1388
01:10:33.763 --> 01:10:35.597
   I gotta watch your movies.

1389
01:10:35.699 --> 01:10:39.801
       Belle. Belle Knox.

1390
01:10:39.903 --> 01:10:43.137
 Why don't you come sit up front
      with me, Belle Knox?

1391
01:10:45.141 --> 01:10:54.983
      ( dance music plays )

1392
01:10:55.085 --> 01:10:57.085
         Hi there, sir.

1393
01:10:57.187 --> 01:10:58.920
         Belle. You're a
       naughty schoolgirl?

1394
01:10:59.022 --> 01:10:59.954
            Yes I am.

1395
01:11:00.056 --> 01:11:02.757
  I go to Bad Girl University.

1396
01:11:02.859 --> 01:11:03.992
        Sign my picture?

1397
01:11:04.094 --> 01:11:05.126
              Sure.

1398
01:11:05.228 --> 01:11:07.028
           That's $20.

1399
01:11:10.934 --> 01:11:12.166
      Can I take my picture
            with you?

1400
01:11:12.269 --> 01:11:13.601
               Ok.

1401
01:11:13.703 --> 01:11:16.771
  How about if I hold onto you
  a little bit just like that?

1402
01:11:16.873 --> 01:11:18.640
              Yeah.

1403
01:11:18.742 --> 01:11:20.174
     Well, can I get a kiss
          on the cheek?

1404
01:11:20.277 --> 01:11:21.743
               Ok.

1405
01:11:21.845 --> 01:11:23.778
      Man. You are so hot!

1406
01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:25.213
    What're you doing later?

1407
01:11:25.315 --> 01:11:26.914
      Or should I say who?

1408
01:11:27.017 --> 01:11:28.383
      I'm a very busy girl.

1409
01:11:28.485 --> 01:11:29.751
         I bet you are.

1410
01:11:29.853 --> 01:11:31.753
   Hey Belle, tell them about
      your new sex toy line

1411
01:11:31.855 --> 01:11:34.022
     coming out next month.

1412
01:11:34.124 --> 01:11:39.394
      Sometimes I'm a very
          naughty girl.

1413
01:11:39.496 --> 01:11:42.263
         I bet you need
       lots of spankings.

1414
01:11:42.365 --> 01:11:45.533
I do. I can't get enough of 'em.

1415
01:11:45.635 --> 01:11:47.802
    I'd like to bend you over
     and teach you a lesson

1416
01:11:47.904 --> 01:11:50.138
        for being so bad.

1417
01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:51.806
     I can help discipline.

1418
01:11:51.908 --> 01:11:54.909
   Uncooperative little girls
       are my speciality.

1419
01:11:55.011 --> 01:11:57.445
           Excuse us.

1420
01:11:58.682 --> 01:12:00.348
   How are you doing, sweetie?

1421
01:12:00.450 --> 01:12:01.316
             I'm ok.

1422
01:12:01.418 --> 01:12:01.949
              Yeah?

1423
01:12:02.052 --> 01:12:03.084
        This is intense.

1424
01:12:03.186 --> 01:12:04.786
 I know, but just keep your head
          in the game.

1425
01:12:04.888 --> 01:12:06.521
  Forget about all the gossip.

1426
01:12:06.623 --> 01:12:07.755
          What gossip?

1427
01:12:07.857 --> 01:12:09.057
        Oh, it's nothing.

1428
01:12:09.159 --> 01:12:11.693
 Just some girls are complaining
     and calling you a diva.

1429
01:12:11.795 --> 01:12:14.762
      It's nothing, really.
       Just typical stuff.

1430
01:12:16.032 --> 01:12:17.799
        It's gonna be ok.

1431
01:12:17.901 --> 01:12:18.833
               Ok?

1432
01:12:26.276 --> 01:12:27.375
 Looks like you did quite well.

1433
01:12:27.477 --> 01:12:29.310
         Yeah, I guess.

1434
01:12:29.412 --> 01:12:32.013
  I still have to pay for hair
     and makeup and travel,

1435
01:12:32.115 --> 01:12:34.082
   so maybe I made like $500.

1436
01:12:34.184 --> 01:12:36.150
    But you didn't have to go
         down on anyone.

1437
01:12:36.252 --> 01:12:39.153
              Yeah.

1438
01:12:39.255 --> 01:12:43.257
 Hey, have you heard that people
  have been calling me a diva?

1439
01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:44.525
     Don't worry about that.

1440
01:12:44.627 --> 01:12:45.827
   Why would anyone say that?

1441
01:12:45.929 --> 01:12:47.328
 Belle, you're new. You're hot.

1442
01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:48.429
    You booked a lot of jobs.

1443
01:12:48.531 --> 01:12:50.031
        The other girls,
      they're just jealous.

1444
01:12:50.133 --> 01:12:51.866
    But I really want people
           to like me.

1445
01:12:51.968 --> 01:12:53.468
            They do.

1446
01:12:54.771 --> 01:13:00.108
      ( shutters snapping )

1447
01:13:00.210 --> 01:13:07.315
      ( shutters snapping )

1448
01:13:07.417 --> 01:13:08.816
           <i> Over here.</i>

1449
01:13:09.919 --> 01:13:11.652
              Dora.

1450
01:13:11.755 --> 01:13:13.955
      Hey, what's going on?

1451
01:13:14.057 --> 01:13:16.324
       Nothing, we're just
         heading inside.

1452
01:13:16.426 --> 01:13:17.492
             Um, no.

1453
01:13:17.594 --> 01:13:21.362
       Something's wrong.

1454
01:13:21.464 --> 01:13:22.864
     Why don't your friends
            like me?

1455
01:13:22.966 --> 01:13:24.399
      Listen, you're really
       pissing people off

1456
01:13:24.501 --> 01:13:25.833
      with all your press.

1457
01:13:25.935 --> 01:13:29.270
  I was just trying to put out
       a positive message.

1458
01:13:29.372 --> 01:13:31.272
       Talk to you later.

1459
01:13:34.844 --> 01:13:38.346
      ( shutters snapping )

1460
01:13:38.448 --> 01:13:45.653
           ( sobbing )

1461
01:13:45.755 --> 01:13:47.088
             You ok?

1462
01:13:47.190 --> 01:13:48.956
         Yeah, I'm fine.

1463
01:13:49.058 --> 01:13:51.025
        I tell you what.

1464
01:13:51.127 --> 01:13:54.829
  If you ever feel like you're
    becoming your alter-ego,

1465
01:13:54.931 --> 01:13:56.664
     that's when you should
           be worried.

1466
01:13:56.766 --> 01:14:00.401
    You have to keep fantasy
     separate from reality.

1467
01:14:00.503 --> 01:14:04.839
That's how you protect yourself.

1468
01:14:04.941 --> 01:14:06.974
     They're waiting for you
           out there.

1469
01:14:11.614 --> 01:14:13.614
           Good luck.

1470
01:14:13.716 --> 01:14:15.483
    <i> On behalf of the Risqué</i>
       <i> Awards Committee,</i>

1471
01:14:15.585 --> 01:14:18.986
   I am especially excited to
   present our final category.

1472
01:14:19.088 --> 01:14:21.622
And the winner for Best Newcomer
           goes to...

1473
01:14:23.693 --> 01:14:24.725
           Belle Knox!

1474
01:14:24.828 --> 01:14:25.760
            <i> Alright!</i>

1475
01:14:25.862 --> 01:14:37.972
          ( applause )

1476
01:14:38.074 --> 01:14:39.407
           Thank you.

1477
01:14:39.509 --> 01:14:42.043
      Oh my gosh, you guys.

1478
01:14:42.145 --> 01:14:43.211
     I just- I want everyone
             to know

1479
01:14:43.313 --> 01:14:46.113
how much this award means to me.

1480
01:14:46.216 --> 01:14:49.350
  I really love this business,

1481
01:14:49.452 --> 01:14:52.954
   so thank you for being like
         my new family.

1482
01:14:53.056 --> 01:14:57.558
          ( applause )

1483
01:15:08.238 --> 01:15:11.839
   There goes the spokesperson
    for the entire industry.

1484
01:15:11.941 --> 01:15:14.475
           Belle Knox.

1485
01:15:15.578 --> 01:15:17.645
              Dora.

1486
01:15:17.747 --> 01:15:19.847
    Hey, can I hang with you?

1487
01:15:19.949 --> 01:15:20.982
               No.

1488
01:15:21.084 --> 01:15:22.950
      Go find someone else
         to cling onto.

1489
01:15:23.052 --> 01:15:24.318
  Why are you being like this?

1490
01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:25.953
    You really don't get it,
             do you?

1491
01:15:26.055 --> 01:15:27.755
    Nobody asked you to go on
       every show and blog

1492
01:15:27.857 --> 01:15:29.056
        and speak for us.

1493
01:15:29.158 --> 01:15:30.725
  You've been in this industry
        for five minutes

1494
01:15:30.827 --> 01:15:33.127
       and you don't know
   what you're talking about.

1495
01:15:33.229 --> 01:15:34.695
   But you love that spotlight

1496
01:15:34.797 --> 01:15:37.231
   and I guess that's the most
      important thing, huh?

1497
01:15:37.333 --> 01:15:39.367
  No, I- I was trying to help.

1498
01:15:39.469 --> 01:15:41.135
 Yeah, trying to help yourself.

1499
01:15:41.237 --> 01:15:44.705
     None of us need or want
         your help, ok?

1500
01:15:44.807 --> 01:15:45.973
   I thought we were friends.

1501
01:15:46.075 --> 01:15:47.074
      We hung out a couple
            of times

1502
01:15:47.176 --> 01:15:49.176
 but we hardly know each other.

1503
01:15:49.279 --> 01:15:51.412
       Wow, are you really
           that naive?

1504
01:16:09.632 --> 01:16:11.966
           Hey, baby.

1505
01:16:12.068 --> 01:16:13.067
              Don?

1506
01:16:13.169 --> 01:16:15.069
       It's just- just me.

1507
01:16:18.408 --> 01:16:19.173
 What are you doing in my room?

1508
01:16:19.275 --> 01:16:20.207
            Get out!

1509
01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:21.375
       ( slurring ) Don't
         worry about it.

1510
01:16:21.477 --> 01:16:24.278
    I just- I told front desk
        we were friends.

1511
01:16:24.380 --> 01:16:26.647
        And maybe greased
    the wheels a little bit.

1512
01:16:26.749 --> 01:16:28.549
       Get out of my room!

1513
01:16:28.651 --> 01:16:30.484
             Relax.

1514
01:16:30.587 --> 01:16:32.086
          I got money.

1515
01:16:32.188 --> 01:16:32.820
      How much do you need?

1516
01:16:32.922 --> 01:16:33.688
       Get out of my room!

1517
01:16:33.790 --> 01:16:34.655
    I don't want your money!

1518
01:16:34.757 --> 01:16:36.357
        Get out! Get out!

1519
01:16:36.459 --> 01:16:38.159
       Get out of my room!

1520
01:16:38.261 --> 01:16:39.760
               Go!

1521
01:16:39.862 --> 01:16:41.696
        Ok, you're right.

1522
01:16:50.817 --> 01:16:53.117
   Are you checking out, too?

1523
01:16:53.219 --> 01:16:54.252
         Can you believe
         they're having

1524
01:16:54.354 --> 01:16:56.387
        some sort of smut
        convention here?

1525
01:16:56.489 --> 01:16:58.890
       I mean, I was told
      this is a good hotel

1526
01:16:58.992 --> 01:17:00.925
     to bring my family to.

1527
01:17:03.563 --> 01:17:05.062
   I'm gonna give them a piece
           of my mind.

1528
01:17:05.165 --> 01:17:07.198
  These people are disgusting.

1529
01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:09.000
       We can't stay here.

1530
01:17:09.102 --> 01:17:12.170
        Yeah, it's crazy.

1531
01:17:12.272 --> 01:17:15.139
         You go to Duke?

1532
01:17:15.241 --> 01:17:17.809
  That is an excellent school.

1533
01:17:17.911 --> 01:17:20.378
   Your parents must be proud.

1534
01:17:45.471 --> 01:17:54.045
           ( sobbing )

1535
01:18:14.801 --> 01:18:16.200
          ( knocking )

1536
01:18:16.302 --> 01:18:18.002
        <i> Be right there.</i>

1537
01:18:22.108 --> 01:18:23.875
              Hey.

1538
01:18:23.977 --> 01:18:26.510
        What's going on?

1539
01:18:26.613 --> 01:18:28.012
         Can I come in?

1540
01:18:28.114 --> 01:18:30.014
           Yeah, sure.

1541
01:18:37.290 --> 01:18:40.725
   Where are you coming from?

1542
01:18:40.827 --> 01:18:42.727
  An adult industry convention.

1543
01:18:42.829 --> 01:18:44.495
 I don't want to talk about it.

1544
01:18:49.335 --> 01:18:54.805
    I just want to make sure
            we're ok.

1545
01:18:54.908 --> 01:18:57.708
         Yeah. We're ok.

1546
01:19:00.246 --> 01:19:01.846
          It's just...

1547
01:19:01.948 --> 01:19:05.383
 you have this whole other world
      that you're a part of

1548
01:19:05.485 --> 01:19:09.153
   and it's not easy to relate
          to sometimes.

1549
01:19:09.255 --> 01:19:12.723
             I know.

1550
01:19:12.825 --> 01:19:14.792
            I just...

1551
01:19:14.894 --> 01:19:20.331
      I thought I had found
     this whole other family

1552
01:19:20.433 --> 01:19:25.603
         and this place
    where I sort of belonged.

1553
01:19:25.705 --> 01:19:29.907
      But it really wasn't
        like that at all.

1554
01:19:30.009 --> 01:19:34.211
  And you have been so awesome

1555
01:19:34.314 --> 01:19:41.152
   and so supportive and I am
      so grateful for that.

1556
01:19:41.254 --> 01:19:43.321
   You're wearing my necklace.

1557
01:19:43.423 --> 01:19:46.190
     That's what friends do.

1558
01:19:46.292 --> 01:19:49.627
    What you're trying to do,
           it's a lot.

1559
01:19:49.729 --> 01:19:51.629
     It's a lot to take on.

1560
01:19:51.731 --> 01:19:56.500
    It'd be a lot for anyone.

1561
01:19:56.602 --> 01:20:00.972
 This all started because I just
    wanted to pay for school

1562
01:20:01.074 --> 01:20:04.942
  and now everything has gotten
       so out of control.

1563
01:20:05.044 --> 01:20:11.916
     It's like I blinked and
     my entire life changed.

1564
01:20:15.121 --> 01:20:16.988
       You made a choice.

1565
01:20:17.090 --> 01:20:19.357
     And you owned up to it.

1566
01:20:19.459 --> 01:20:23.327
  So who cares if other people
           judge you?

1567
01:20:23.429 --> 01:20:26.998
       The last few months
        have been crazy,

1568
01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:29.700
    but you're only eighteen.

1569
01:20:29.802 --> 01:20:31.702
       You're not supposed
       to know everything.

1570
01:20:31.804 --> 01:20:34.905
   You've got your whole life
          ahead of you.

1571
01:20:35.008 --> 01:20:38.776
        Thank you, Jolie.

1572
01:20:38.878 --> 01:20:44.448
    I'm just not really sure
  what I'm supposed to do next.

1573
01:20:44.550 --> 01:20:46.617
       Anything you want.

1574
01:20:46.719 --> 01:20:49.387
   Having sex on camera is not
 the only thing you're good at,

1575
01:20:49.489 --> 01:20:50.654
      that's for dang sure.

1576
01:20:50.757 --> 01:20:51.956
           ( laughs )

1577
01:20:52.058 --> 01:20:53.858
             Thanks.

1578
01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:55.659
            Any time.

1579
01:21:06.439 --> 01:21:09.140
       I grew up in a very
      conservative family.

1580
01:21:09.242 --> 01:21:11.542
 And while I remain conservative
          economically,

1581
01:21:11.644 --> 01:21:14.045
        I feel much more
        socially liberal

1582
01:21:14.147 --> 01:21:17.181
  and in line with libertarian
        ideals and themes

1583
01:21:17.283 --> 01:21:20.885
  such as free speech, choice,
          and autonomy

1584
01:21:20.987 --> 01:21:25.122
    when it comes to what you
     do with your own body.

1585
01:21:25.224 --> 01:21:29.360
    Whether I choose to be a
 sex worker or a social worker,

1586
01:21:29.462 --> 01:21:33.597
   I don't need the government
  telling me how and what to do

1587
01:21:33.699 --> 01:21:36.767
      and interfering with
      my personal liberty.

1588
01:21:36.869 --> 01:21:39.070
          ( cheering )

1589
01:21:39.172 --> 01:21:46.911
          ( applause )

1590
01:21:47.013 --> 01:21:50.748
    Hey, Miriam. Can we talk?

1591
01:21:50.850 --> 01:21:52.750
    <i> We'll just be over here.</i>

1592
01:21:55.721 --> 01:21:58.789
      Last time we did that
   things didn't go too well.

1593
01:21:58.891 --> 01:21:59.990
       I tried to be fair.

1594
01:22:00.093 --> 01:22:02.526
     I was much kinder than
     those talk show hosts.

1595
01:22:02.628 --> 01:22:03.928
          That's true.

1596
01:22:04.030 --> 01:22:05.529
  I know you tried to be fair.

1597
01:22:05.631 --> 01:22:07.131
     But I'm trying to keep
      a low profile, so...

1598
01:22:07.233 --> 01:22:11.535
     Just out of curiosity,
    are you still doing porn?

1599
01:22:11.637 --> 01:22:14.338
     I mean, off the record.

1600
01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:17.274
 Let's just say I'm re-focusing
        some of my energy

1601
01:22:17.376 --> 01:22:18.709
     on the bigger picture.

1602
01:22:18.811 --> 01:22:20.377
   What is the bigger picture?

1603
01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:22.880
      I mean, what's next?

1604
01:22:22.982 --> 01:22:24.849
            Politics.

1605
01:22:24.951 --> 01:22:26.050
             Really?

1606
01:22:26.152 --> 01:22:27.952
      Like you want to run
           for office?

1607
01:22:28.054 --> 01:22:28.986
            One day.

1608
01:22:29.088 --> 01:22:30.354
      How will you do that?

1609
01:22:30.456 --> 01:22:33.290
       I mean, your videos
     will always be online.

1610
01:22:33.392 --> 01:22:35.559
   Our generation is changing
           the world.

1611
01:22:35.661 --> 01:22:38.262
 And so is the stigma associated
    with a lot of lifestyles

1612
01:22:38.364 --> 01:22:41.465
    that have generally been
         on the fringes.

1613
01:22:41.567 --> 01:22:43.234
I believe that because I believe
         in our country

1614
01:22:43.336 --> 01:22:45.469
    and I believe that people
            are good.

1615
01:22:45.571 --> 01:22:47.271
           Don't you?

1616
01:22:47.373 --> 01:22:49.240
          I'm not sure.

1617
01:22:49.342 --> 01:22:52.443
          I'd like to.

1618
01:22:52.545 --> 01:22:54.345
       I admire how you've
       handled everything.

1619
01:22:54.447 --> 01:22:56.280
        I don't know what
       I would have done.

1620
01:22:56.382 --> 01:22:59.917
Well, you probably wouldn't have
  done porn in the first place.

1621
01:23:00.019 --> 01:23:01.585
           ( laughs )

1622
01:23:01.687 --> 01:23:04.488
       Yeah, probably not.

1623
01:23:04.590 --> 01:23:05.856
  You're a tough chick, though.

1624
01:23:05.958 --> 01:23:07.725
     I'm glad you're looking
         to the future.

1625
01:23:07.827 --> 01:23:10.060
    We can only move forward.

1626
01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:16.033
     Take care of yourself.

1627
01:23:16.235 --> 01:23:18.002
            You too.

1628
01:23:23.409 --> 01:23:25.109
          <i> Hey, Miriam?</i>

1629
01:23:25.211 --> 01:23:26.644
          I have to go.

1630
01:23:26.746 --> 01:23:28.412
       It was really nice
           to see you.

1631
01:23:28.514 --> 01:23:30.181
  It was nice to see you, too.

1632
01:23:31.951 --> 01:23:32.950
           Oh, Miriam.

1633
01:23:39.025 --> 01:23:40.024
        ( shutter snaps )
