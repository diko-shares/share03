00:00:38.406 --> 00:00:40.172
<i> Hi, I'm Belle.</i>

3
00:00:56.157 --> 00:00:58.157
I'd like to add this sub
to my third contention

4
00:00:58.259 --> 00:01:00.659
but I'm worried about time.

5
00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:02.361
You can chart it on your flow
and make the call

6
00:01:02.463 --> 00:01:05.464
when you're up there.

7
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:07.900
Oh my god. One o'clock.

8
00:01:08.002 --> 00:01:10.235
I think he's on the other team.

9
00:01:10.337 --> 00:01:12.504
I will gladly argue the negative
on that case.

10
00:01:12.606 --> 00:01:15.674
First, he has zero nerd cred.

11
00:01:15.776 --> 00:01:18.310
Secondly, he's imminently
do-able.

12
00:01:18.412 --> 00:01:20.312
If I'm wondering what
he looks like naked,

13
00:01:20.414 --> 00:01:22.281
which I am,

14
00:01:22.383 --> 00:01:24.650
then there's no way
he's on the team.

15
00:01:24.752 --> 00:01:26.652
( whispering )
You have a boyfriend.

16
00:01:26.754 --> 00:01:28.387
I'm just saying.

17
00:01:28.489 --> 00:01:31.723
<i> Next we have a Lincoln-Douglas</i>
<i> style debate</i>

18
00:01:31.826 --> 00:01:34.726
on whether it is morally
permissible for a victim

19
00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.996
to use deadly force
as a deliberate response

20
00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:40.666
to repeated domestic violence.

21
00:01:40.768 --> 00:01:43.602
Speaking for the affirmative
from Ferndale Prep,

22
00:01:43.704 --> 00:01:45.404
Miss Miriam Weeks.

23
00:01:45.506 --> 00:01:46.405
Miriam?

24
00:01:46.507 --> 00:01:47.806
Make it rain, girl.

25
00:01:47.908 --> 00:01:49.675
( applause )

26
00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.954
I affirm the resolution that
it is morally permissible

27
00:02:02.056 --> 00:02:06.058
for victims to use deadly force
as a deliberate response

28
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.328
to repeated domestic violence.

29
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.432
I define "moral" as pertaining
to, or concerned with,

30
00:02:13.534 --> 00:02:16.034
the principles of right
and wrong.

31
00:02:16.137 --> 00:02:20.105
"Permissible" as permitted
or allowable.

32
00:02:20.207 --> 00:02:23.375
A "victim" as a person who
suffers from a destructive

33
00:02:23.477 --> 00:02:27.279
or injurious action
or agency.

34
00:02:27.381 --> 00:02:31.617
My value for this debate
is justice.

35
00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:35.154
Plato defines "justice" as
doing well to one's friend

36
00:02:35.256 --> 00:02:36.855
if he's good

37
00:02:36.957 --> 00:02:39.925
<i> and harming one's enemy</i>
<i> if he is evil.</i>

38
00:02:40.027 --> 00:02:42.161
<i> ( Ralph ): Miriam, can you</i>
<i> come in here?</i>

39
00:02:44.965 --> 00:02:47.299
You got something
in the mail today.

40
00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:50.869
It's from uh, Duke University.

41
00:02:50.971 --> 00:02:52.271
You ever heard of that place?

42
00:02:52.373 --> 00:02:53.272
<i>Oh, honey. Just give it to her.</i>

43
00:02:53.374 --> 00:02:53.739
Let me see it.

44
00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:55.908
Aah.

45
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.976
Oh my gosh, this is it.

46
00:02:58.078 --> 00:02:58.844
It's a big envelope.

47
00:02:58.946 --> 00:03:00.012
Is that good?

48
00:03:00.114 --> 00:03:01.346
Only one way to find out.

49
00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:10.222
I got in!

50
00:03:10.324 --> 00:03:11.290
Yes!

51
00:03:11.392 --> 00:03:13.158
( squealing )

52
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.160
Bring it in.

53
00:03:15.262 --> 00:03:16.862
See? I told you.

54
00:03:16.964 --> 00:03:18.463
When you put your studies first

55
00:03:18.566 --> 00:03:20.465
and you're willing to work hard-

56
00:03:20.568 --> 00:03:22.935
( simultaneous )
Good things happen.

57
00:03:23.037 --> 00:03:26.438
What kind of financial aid
package did they offer?

58
00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.275
That part of the offer appears
to be a little underwhelming.

59
00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:31.810
It's Duke though.

60
00:03:31.912 --> 00:03:34.179
But Vanderbilt offered you
a full ride.

61
00:03:34.281 --> 00:03:35.714
It's just as good a school.

62
00:03:35.816 --> 00:03:38.917
But Duke is my dream school,
and it's number one for pre-law.

63
00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.118
It's your decision.

64
00:03:40.221 --> 00:03:41.787
If Duke is what you
have your heart set on

65
00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:45.090
then we'll figure out a way
to make the finances work.

66
00:03:45.192 --> 00:03:46.792
Thank you, daddy!

67
00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:52.431
To the graduates.

68
00:03:52.533 --> 00:03:53.732
Here, here.

69
00:03:55.536 --> 00:03:56.802
<i> ( Mom ): To Miriam and Josh.</i>

70
00:03:58.205 --> 00:03:59.671
So, big day little sis.

71
00:03:59.773 --> 00:04:01.907
Do you feel any different now
that it's official?

72
00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:03.375
Mmm, not really.

73
00:04:03.477 --> 00:04:05.143
I'm just relieved, mostly.

74
00:04:05.246 --> 00:04:07.045
All the hard work paid off.

75
00:04:07.147 --> 00:04:10.015
<i> ( Mom ): And now you</i>
<i> can't be mad about having</i>
<i> a strict curfew.</i>

76
00:04:10.117 --> 00:04:11.883
<i> ( Miriam ): I can still be</i>
<i> a little mad.</i>

77
00:04:15.656 --> 00:04:19.524
Uh, wait.
Let's say grace.

78
00:04:19.627 --> 00:04:23.061
Lord, thank you for these gifts
which we are about to receive

79
00:04:23.163 --> 00:04:24.963
through the bounty
of Christ.

80
00:04:25.065 --> 00:04:25.664
Amen.

81
00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:27.099
Amen.

82
00:04:28.535 --> 00:04:29.768
Amen.

83
00:04:32.673 --> 00:04:34.539
Hey. What's going on?

84
00:04:34.642 --> 00:04:35.507
You're being really weird.

85
00:04:35.609 --> 00:04:37.442
No, I'm not.

86
00:04:37.544 --> 00:04:38.810
Yeah, you are.

87
00:04:38.912 --> 00:04:42.748
I just don't need you hanging
on me every second, ok?

88
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.250
Look. I'm sorry.

89
00:04:45.352 --> 00:04:47.653
But I feel like I need
to be honest.

90
00:04:47.755 --> 00:04:50.956
We're gonna be 3,000 miles away
from each other next year and I-

91
00:04:51.058 --> 00:04:52.157
No-

92
00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:53.158
I don't think that
it's such a good idea

93
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.062
if either of us are tied down.

94
00:04:57.164 --> 00:04:59.097
You know I'm crazy about you.

95
00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:01.166
But it just makes sense.

96
00:05:01.268 --> 00:05:03.869
I want to have fun, and
I want you to have fun.

97
00:05:03.971 --> 00:05:06.104
You're gonna go to Duke
and you're gonna meet guys

98
00:05:06.206 --> 00:05:08.106
and you're gonna wanna go
on dates and party-

99
00:05:08.208 --> 00:05:10.575
No, don't tell me what I want.

100
00:05:10.678 --> 00:05:11.943
This is about you and the fact

101
00:05:12.046 --> 00:05:13.278
that you want to get
with other girls, just say it.

102
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.747
I made up my mind.

103
00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:18.216
Don't embarrass yourself,
Miriam.

104
00:05:21.322 --> 00:05:24.256

This is such a beautiful campus.

This map is basically

110
00:05:54.888 --> 00:05:57.456
I think that building
over there is her dorm.

Yeah, that's it.

Dad? Are you coming?

Just a moment.

117

I'll catch up with you.
I have to take this.

118

Go ahead.

119
00:06:17.177 --> 00:06:18.310
Ok.

120
00:06:21.315 --> 00:06:22.814
Is this a co-ed building?

121
00:06:22.916 --> 00:06:25.751
Mom, most dorms are co-ed.

122
00:06:25.853 --> 00:06:27.252
I don't think that's true.

123
00:06:27.354 --> 00:06:28.954
I'm pretty sure my dorms
were co-ed.

124
00:06:29.056 --> 00:06:30.522
I don't remember that.

125
00:06:30.624 --> 00:06:31.923
Of course you don't.

126
00:06:32.025 --> 00:06:34.760
You probably never even
noticed because Paul's a guy.

127
00:06:34.862 --> 00:06:36.661
I didn't say that.

128
00:06:36.764 --> 00:06:38.296
You didn't have to.

130
00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:48.006
This room is way nicer
than mine was.

131
00:06:48.108 --> 00:06:50.809
It could use a little bit of
warming up.

132
00:06:52.713 --> 00:06:54.146
It's perfect.

133
00:06:56.316 --> 00:06:58.717
What's wrong?

134
00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:01.553
I'm getting called back

135
00:07:01.655 --> 00:07:02.387

Can't someone else go?

137
00:07:03.924 --> 00:07:05.190

We can still afford for me
to go to school here, right?

141
00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.499
I don't want you to worry
about this.

142
00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:17.436
These things have a way
of working themselves out.

Hello.

147

I'm Miriam and this
is my family.

148
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.380
We're from Spokane,
Washington.

149
00:07:28.482 --> 00:07:30.248
Hi, Miriam. Hi, Miriam's family.

150
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:32.017
It's nice to meet y'all.

151
00:07:32.119 --> 00:07:34.085
I'm Jolie, I just moved
in yesterday.

152
00:07:34.188 --> 00:07:35.420
I'm from New Orleans.

153
00:07:35.522 --> 00:07:37.622
Oh, Nola, that's so cool.

154
00:07:37.724 --> 00:07:39.558
I've always wanted to go
to Mardi Gras.

155
00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:44.029
Yeah, it's fun, but Jazz Fest
is way better, trust me.

156
00:07:44.131 --> 00:07:45.664
Well, it's nice to meet you,
dear.

157
00:07:45.766 --> 00:07:47.933
Let's go get the rest
of the stuff.

158
00:07:49.736 --> 00:07:51.703
( inhales )

159
00:07:51.805 --> 00:07:53.939
You smell that?

160
00:07:54.041 --> 00:07:55.640
What?

161
00:07:55.742 --> 00:07:58.477
The sweet, sweet smell
of freedom.

162
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:04.816
So how'd you find out
about this party?

163
00:08:04.918 --> 00:08:06.017
Are you kidding?

164
00:08:06.119 --> 00:08:07.919
This is a big party campus.

165
00:08:08.021 --> 00:08:10.155
Plus, it's Independence Day.

166
00:08:10.257 --> 00:08:13.191
The first official night on
campus before class starts?

167
00:08:13.293 --> 00:08:17.095
It's so weird to just not have
to tell anyone where I'm going.

168
00:08:17.197 --> 00:08:19.531
My mom watched me like
a hawk in high school.

169
00:08:19.633 --> 00:08:22.434
So did mine, but I sorta
deserved it.

170
00:08:22.536 --> 00:08:24.769
I did everything I was supposed
to do.

171
00:08:24.872 --> 00:08:27.239
All the time.

172
00:08:27.341 --> 00:08:29.341
Hey, I like your purse.

173
00:08:29.443 --> 00:08:31.176
Thanks, girl.

174
00:08:33.747 --> 00:08:35.447
Woah, that's no joke.

175
00:08:37.918 --> 00:08:39.184
It's nothing.

176
00:08:39.286 --> 00:08:41.820
I guess I just had my Girl
Interrupted phase in high school

177
00:08:41.922 --> 00:08:44.856
or whatever, you know?

178
00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:49.794
Yeah, totally.

179
00:08:49.897 --> 00:08:51.596
So what do you think
you're gonna major in?

180

Hey, you too.

224
00:11:01.595 --> 00:11:03.695
Uh, so I just heard Theta Tao
is throwing a party

225
00:11:03.797 --> 00:11:07.098
and it is supposed to be
bananas,

226
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.234
and plus I plan to rush Theta

227
00:11:09.336 --> 00:11:11.736
so I gotta get my ground
game going.

228
00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:13.605
Would you ladies like

00:11:13.707 --> 00:11:15.473
Actually, you know, I think
I'm gonna crash.

Whore.

238
00:11:37.064 --> 00:11:40.265
All of these words are deeply
ingrained into our psyche.

239
00:11:40.367 --> 00:11:42.300
But what do they
really mean?

240
00:11:42.402 --> 00:11:45.837
What we will do in this course

re-examine our own beliefs

242

<i> How are you? How's school?</i>

247
00:12:02.355 --> 00:12:05.223
Um, it's fine. What's going on?

248
00:12:05.325 --> 00:12:07.125
Well, I needed to talk to you.

249
00:12:07.227 --> 00:12:12.764
<i> Uh, your dad and I can't</i>
<i> cover your tuition right now.</i>

250
00:12:12.866 --> 00:12:15.366
What do you mean?

251
00:12:15.469 --> 00:12:18.870
<i> We're overextended with the</i>
<i>huge pay cut your dad has taken.</i>

252
00:12:18.972 --> 00:12:20.572
You said it would be fine.

253
00:12:20.674 --> 00:12:22.340
<i> It will be, don't worry.</i>

254
00:12:22.442 --> 00:12:25.210
It just means you take out
some loans.

255
00:12:25.312 --> 00:12:26.878
No, I don't want to do that.

256
00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:28.713
Dad was still paying off
his medical school loans

257
00:12:28.815 --> 00:12:30.148
until I was in middle school.

258
00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.117
I'll be in debt for the rest
of my life.

259
00:12:32.219 --> 00:12:33.785
<i> I'm so sorry, sweetie.</i>

260
00:12:33.887 --> 00:12:36.254
<i> You know if we had the money</i>
<i> we would give it to you.</i>

261
00:12:36.356 --> 00:12:39.457
<i> Maybe you should talk</i>
<i> to financial aid.</i>

262
00:12:46.433 --> 00:12:47.966
How did the meeting go?

263
00:12:48.068 --> 00:12:50.835
Horrible. It's like
I'm in no man's land.

264
00:12:50.937 --> 00:12:53.438
My parents make too much money
to qualify for financial aid

265
00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:56.174
but not enough
to actually pay for school.

266
00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:58.409
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

267
00:12:58.512 --> 00:12:59.944
I don't know.

268
00:13:00.046 --> 00:13:02.347
You could get a job
on campus.

269
00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:05.116
Tuition is $4,300 a month.

270
00:13:05.218 --> 00:13:06.584
I couldn't even make a dent
in that

271
00:13:06.686 --> 00:13:08.953
with the types of jobs
I could get.

272
00:13:09.055 --> 00:13:11.022
Don't waitresses
make good money?

273
00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:12.524
I'm guessing you haven't
waitressed.

274
00:13:12.626 --> 00:13:14.759
No. I always wanted a summer job

275
00:13:14.861 --> 00:13:17.495
but my family goes to
the Cape every summer.

276
00:13:17.597 --> 00:13:18.830
You're lucky.

277
00:13:18.932 --> 00:13:22.200
I did it once at a pie house
and the tips were awful,

278
00:13:22.302 --> 00:13:25.436
the customers were rude,
it was kind of degrading.

279
00:13:25.539 --> 00:13:26.805
Can't you take out loans?

280
00:13:26.907 --> 00:13:29.507
I don't want to be in debt
for the rest of my life.

281
00:13:29.609 --> 00:13:30.975
You know what? Screw it.

282
00:13:31.077 --> 00:13:32.977
I'll start a Ponzi scheme.

283
00:13:33.079 --> 00:13:34.245
That's too much work.

284
00:13:34.347 --> 00:13:35.713
You could rob a bank?

285
00:13:35.816 --> 00:13:37.415
Or become a porn star.

286
00:13:37.517 --> 00:13:39.317

287
00:15:54.287 --> 00:15:56.587

288
00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:57.588
Nothing.

289
00:15:57.691 --> 00:16:00.091
Sorry, I just can't sleep.

290
00:16:14.708 --> 00:16:22.380

<i> We're a hardcore fetish site.</i>

305

Oh. I don't think so.

307
00:16:59.686 --> 00:17:01.586

314
00:17:19.973 --> 00:17:23.975

315
00:17:24.077 --> 00:17:27.078
so I'm gonna visit her
this weekend in DC.

316
00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:30.882

No. She's going to visit

00:19:02.108 --> 00:19:03.708
There's a bathroom
just down the hall.

361
00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:05.676
I need you to sign this release
before we get going.

362
00:19:05.778 --> 00:19:08.012
It just says you get paid
after we finish the scene,

363
00:19:08.114 --> 00:19:11.449
nobody's gonna sue anybody,
you're eighteen, blah blah blah.

364
00:19:11.551 --> 00:19:13.518
Just sign it.

365
00:19:15.955 --> 00:19:18.156
There you go.

366
00:19:26.199 --> 00:19:27.064
You're leaving?

367
00:19:27.167 --> 00:19:28.132
Yeah.

368
00:19:28.234 --> 00:19:29.267
I don't stay for the shoots,
hun.

369
00:19:31.371 --> 00:19:32.737
Belle, this is your co-star,
Buck.

370
00:19:32.839 --> 00:19:35.773
He likes to uh... well,
you know.

371
00:19:35.875 --> 00:19:38.142
Hi. It's nice to meet you.

372
00:19:38.244 --> 00:19:41.145
Yeah, sure.

373
00:19:41.247 --> 00:19:42.813
This is gonna be a fun one.

374
00:19:42.916 --> 00:19:45.783
Alright, let's roll.
Have a seat.

375
00:19:48.788 --> 00:19:51.722
<i> So, what's your name?</i>

376
00:19:51.824 --> 00:19:54.225
Um, Belle Knox.

377
00:19:54.327 --> 00:19:56.827
Belle, like Beauty and
the Beast, you know?

378
00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:58.429
<i> Oh, you like fairy tales?</i>

379
00:19:58.531 --> 00:20:00.698
We got a real special
fairy tale for ya.

380
00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.633
<i> You a slut, Belle?</i>

381
00:20:02.735 --> 00:20:03.734
( laughs )

382
00:20:03.836 --> 00:20:04.835
We'll see about that.

383
00:20:04.938 --> 00:20:05.836
How old are you?

384
00:20:05.939 --> 00:20:07.205
<i> What do you do, slut?</i>

385
00:20:07.307 --> 00:20:10.341
Um, I'm eighteen
and I go to college.

386
00:20:10.443 --> 00:20:11.943
<i> Oh, what do you study?</i>

387
00:20:12.045 --> 00:20:12.810
( laughs )

388
00:20:12.912 --> 00:20:14.245
Women's studies and law.

389
00:20:14.347 --> 00:20:15.780
<i> Yeah? Women's studies?</i>

390
00:20:15.882 --> 00:20:17.148
<i> Are you a feminist?</i>

391
00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:18.382
Yeah.

392
00:20:18.484 --> 00:20:21.118
<i> A femi-Nazi,</i>
<i> that's what we call 'em.</i>

393
00:20:21.221 --> 00:20:23.754
What're you doing
at Facial Assault?

394
00:20:23.856 --> 00:20:25.790
You must really be a dumb slut.

395
00:20:27.727 --> 00:20:29.894
Um... I like rough sex.

396
00:20:29.996 --> 00:20:31.829
<i> You think so, huh?</i>

397
00:20:31.931 --> 00:20:33.831
<i> Do you have any idea</i>
<i> what you're in for?</i>

398
00:20:33.933 --> 00:20:35.333
<i> I don't think she does.</i>

399
00:20:35.435 --> 00:20:37.268
<i> We're gonna teach you</i>
<i> a lesson in feminism</i>

400
00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:39.036
<i> you will never forget.</i>

401
00:20:39.138 --> 00:20:40.638
( laughs )

402
00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.306
You know, you got
a really dumb laugh.

403
00:20:42.408 --> 00:20:43.307
( slap )

404
00:20:43.409 --> 00:20:45.710
Why don't you shut up?

405
00:20:45.812 --> 00:20:46.277
<i> Stand up.</i>

406
00:20:46.379 --> 00:20:48.312
Wait! Wait!

407
00:20:49.415 --> 00:20:50.147
<i> Take off your top.</i>

408
00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:51.148
Ok.

409
00:20:52.885 --> 00:20:53.751
<i> He's got something to put</i>
<i> in your mouth</i>

410
00:20:53.853 --> 00:20:56.687
<i> that's gonna make you shut up.</i>

411
00:20:56.789 --> 00:20:57.588
No, wait, stop!

412
00:20:57.690 --> 00:20:59.056
Stop! Time out!

413
00:20:59.158 --> 00:21:02.226
You're actually hurting me,
that's not what I signed up for.

414
00:21:03.763 --> 00:21:05.062
That's exactly what you
signed up for

415
00:21:05.164 --> 00:21:07.898
and if you don't finish
this scene you don't get paid.

416
00:21:08.001 --> 00:21:09.333
<i> It's very unprofessional,</i>
<i> though.</i>

417
00:21:09.435 --> 00:21:11.135
<i> We all showed up to work.</i>

418
00:21:11.237 --> 00:21:12.803
You'll never work again.

419
00:21:15.074 --> 00:21:18.209
<i> No, it's ok. I'll finish.</i>

420
00:21:18.311 --> 00:21:20.911
But you don't have to hit
so hard.

421
00:21:21.014 --> 00:21:23.781
I can make it look real, ok?

422
00:21:23.883 --> 00:21:25.750
Yeah, ok.

423
00:21:28.621 --> 00:21:30.154
Ok, let's do it.

424
00:21:31.658 --> 00:21:35.693
<i> Oh, so you're a cutter.</i>

425
00:21:35.795 --> 00:21:37.295
I said open your mouth!

426
00:21:37.397 --> 00:21:43.200
<i> You can't cut away the fact</i>
<i>that are a worthless, dumb slut.</i>

427
00:21:43.303 --> 00:21:50.174
( sobbing )

428
00:21:50.276 --> 00:21:57.548
( sobbing )

429
00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:09.827
( phone rings )

430
00:22:09.929 --> 00:22:10.661
Hello?

431
00:22:10.763 --> 00:22:13.230
Hey, Mir. How's Duke?

432
00:22:13.333 --> 00:22:14.532
<i> How's everything?</i>

433
00:22:14.634 --> 00:22:18.002
It's so awesome.

434
00:22:18.104 --> 00:22:21.238
The campus is so beautiful.

435
00:22:21.341 --> 00:22:23.708
<i> I'm just at the church helping</i>
<i> with the food drive and uh,</i>

436
00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:25.142
<i>I thought of you because, well,</i>

437
00:22:25.244 --> 00:22:27.645
<i> you basically organized</i>
<i> this whole thing last year.</i>

438
00:22:27.747 --> 00:22:29.980
<i> Everyone keeps asking</i>
<i> about you.</i>

439
00:22:30.083 --> 00:22:31.949
Really?

440
00:22:32.051 --> 00:22:34.819
That's nice.

441
00:22:34.921 --> 00:22:36.354
Mir...

442
00:22:36.456 --> 00:22:37.254
<i> What's wrong?</i>

443
00:22:37.357 --> 00:22:39.390
<i> I can hear it in your voice.</i>

444
00:22:39.492 --> 00:22:42.860
It's stupid.

445
00:22:42.962 --> 00:22:45.963
I'm just kinda homesick.

446
00:22:46.065 --> 00:22:47.798
It's really lonely here.

447
00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:49.233
<i> That's totally normal.</i>

448
00:22:49.335 --> 00:22:50.568
<i> It's a big change, you know?</i>

449
00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:51.936
<i> Just take some deep breaths.</i>

450
00:22:52.038 --> 00:22:55.940
<i> I know you're gonna crush it</i>
<i> on campus.</i>

451
00:22:56.042 --> 00:22:59.276
Thank you, Paulie.

452
00:22:59.379 --> 00:23:00.745
I love you.

453
00:23:00.847 --> 00:23:02.046
I love you, too, kiddo.

454
00:23:02.148 --> 00:23:03.581
<i> I know you're gonna have</i>
<i> the time of your life.</i>

455
00:23:03.683 --> 00:23:07.084
<i> I promise.</i>

456
00:23:07.186 --> 00:23:10.554
( sobbing )

457
00:23:19.232 --> 00:23:21.265
Why couldn't I have seen
all of this before?

458
00:23:55.501 --> 00:23:58.135
( ringing )

459
00:23:58.237 --> 00:23:59.904
<i> Hello?</i>

460
00:24:00.006 --> 00:24:03.407
Hi. Is this Don at Pinnatus
Models?

461
00:24:03.509 --> 00:24:04.708
Yeah, how can I help you?

462
00:24:04.811 --> 00:24:06.177
Can I sit?

463
00:24:06.279 --> 00:24:10.881
Hi. Uh... my name is Belle
and I just did my first scene

464
00:24:10.983 --> 00:24:12.950
with a site called
Facial Assault.

465
00:24:13.052 --> 00:24:15.553
Facial Assault are
unprofessional clowns

466
00:24:15.655 --> 00:24:17.221
<i> that pray on women</i>
<i> new to the business.</i>

467
00:24:17.323 --> 00:24:19.523
<i> Your first scene should be</i>
<i> something nice and sweet,</i>

468
00:24:19.625 --> 00:24:20.891
<i> like girl on girl.</i>

469
00:24:20.993 --> 00:24:22.326
<i> Not hardcore facial.</i>

470
00:24:22.428 --> 00:24:23.727
<i> You probably didn't even have</i>
<i> a safe word.</i>

471
00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:24.829
No. What is that?

472
00:24:24.931 --> 00:24:27.198
<i> Everyone on set,</i>
<i> before the cameras roll,</i>

473
00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:28.699
<i> is given a safe word.</i>

474
00:24:28.801 --> 00:24:30.134
So then, while you're shooting,
if anyone feels uncomfortable

475
00:24:30.236 --> 00:24:31.268
you just call out the safe word,

476
00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:32.536
everyone stops
what they're doing

477
00:24:32.638 --> 00:24:34.038
<i> and makes sure</i>
<i> that everyone's ok.</i>

478
00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:36.106
That's actually
why I'm calling you.

479
00:24:36.209 --> 00:24:38.342
I'm wondering how
your agency works.

480
00:24:38.444 --> 00:24:42.046
I mean, I'm a student and I
really need to pay my tuition.

481
00:24:42.148 --> 00:24:43.914
It's a super expensive
school.

482
00:24:44.016 --> 00:24:46.250
<i> What's the school?</i>

483
00:24:46.352 --> 00:24:47.151
Duke.

484
00:24:47.253 --> 00:24:48.319
Duke.

485
00:24:48.421 --> 00:24:49.787
Ah, that's the school
for smart kids.

486
00:24:49.889 --> 00:24:54.024
Nobody can know so I have to
work when I'm not in school.

487
00:24:54.126 --> 00:24:55.226
<i> Well, send me some pictures.</i>

488
00:24:55.328 --> 00:24:56.227
That's the first thing
you gotta do,

489
00:24:56.329 --> 00:24:57.695
and if I decide to represent
you,

490
00:24:57.797 --> 00:24:59.029
<i> you can make some</i>
<i> real money even only working</i>

491
00:24:59.131 --> 00:25:00.264
<i> on the weekends.</i>

492
00:25:00.366 --> 00:25:04.168
Ok. Thank you so much for being
so nice.

493
00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:05.603
<i> I'm not being nice, Belle.</i>

494
00:25:05.705 --> 00:25:07.004
I'm being professional, ok?

495
00:25:07.106 --> 00:25:08.973
Send me those pictures.

496
00:25:09.075 --> 00:25:10.674
Bye.

497
00:25:12.545 --> 00:25:15.446
Call me if you want to make
some money.

498
00:25:15.548 --> 00:25:24.488
( phone rings )

499
00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:25.356
Hi.

500
00:25:25.458 --> 00:25:26.924
Hey. I just got home.

501
00:25:27.026 --> 00:25:28.692
When are you getting here?

502
00:25:28.794 --> 00:25:30.661
Yeah, actually it turns out

503
00:25:30.763 --> 00:25:32.930
I'm not coming home
for Thanksgiving.

504
00:25:33.032 --> 00:25:34.498
What? No way.

505
00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:35.666
Why?

506
00:25:35.768 --> 00:25:37.301
I really need to save
the money

507
00:25:37.403 --> 00:25:39.603
and my roommate is staying too,

508
00:25:39.705 --> 00:25:41.805
so we're gonna have a potluck
with some of the other people

509
00:25:41.908 --> 00:25:44.108
who are staying on campus.

510
00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:46.310
I totally understand.

511
00:25:46.412 --> 00:25:49.947
It's just... I miss you.

512
00:25:50.049 --> 00:25:52.383
I miss you, too.

513
00:25:55.988 --> 00:25:57.988
Gobble, gobble.

514
00:25:58.090 --> 00:25:59.623
Are you excited to go home?

515
00:25:59.725 --> 00:26:05.162
Yeah. I can't wait to just relax
and see the fam.

516
00:26:05.264 --> 00:26:06.530
You leave tonight, right?

517
00:26:06.632 --> 00:26:08.766
Yeah, I leave at 7:00.

518
00:26:08.868 --> 00:26:10.234
What do you have in there?

519
00:26:10.336 --> 00:26:12.803
I'm pretty much packing
pajamas to be a sloth in.

520
00:26:12.905 --> 00:26:14.638
I just like to be prepared.

521
00:26:23.449 --> 00:26:24.982
Excuse me.

522
00:26:25.084 --> 00:26:27.184
Hi, are you Don?

523
00:26:27.286 --> 00:26:28.719
Yes. Are you Belle?

524
00:26:28.821 --> 00:26:29.987
Yeah.

525
00:26:30.089 --> 00:26:33.090
You are much prettier
than your photographs.

526
00:26:33.192 --> 00:26:34.592
Let me get that bag.

527
00:26:34.694 --> 00:26:35.793
Thank you.

528
00:26:35.895 --> 00:26:40.464
Ok, now welcome to

529
00:26:40.566 --> 00:26:42.967

Now, have you ever been
with a girl?

559
00:28:37.049 --> 00:28:40.517
Well, I've actually identified
as bisexual for a while

560
00:28:40.619 --> 00:28:44.521

so I'm kind of excited.

Sorry, I couldn't help it.

722
00:36:44.303 --> 00:36:47.304
Open it.

723
00:36:47.406 --> 00:36:50.640
This is awesome.

724
00:36:50.742 --> 00:36:52.409
The fleur de lis is the symbol
of New Orleans

725
00:36:52.511 --> 00:36:54.477
so I thought you might like
to have it when you're here.

726
00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:56.213
It is.

727
00:36:56.315 --> 00:36:58.848
This is so thoughtful.
Thank you.

728
00:36:58.951 --> 00:37:00.584
Are you excited to go home?

729
00:37:00.686 --> 00:37:04.688
Yes. It's been forever
since I've seen my family.

730
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:07.290
You were just there last month
for Thanksgiving.

731
00:37:07.392 --> 00:37:08.959
I know, but...

732
00:37:09.061 --> 00:37:11.027
it just feels like forever ago.

733
00:37:11.129 --> 00:37:16.233
Well, I'm gonna get you
something when I'm in Nola.

734
00:37:16.335 --> 00:37:18.501
That was a beautiful service.

735
00:37:18.604 --> 00:37:20.303
I thought Father Young
did a nice job.

736
00:37:20.405 --> 00:37:22.272
Yeah, the choir sounded good.

737
00:37:22.374 --> 00:37:24.341
<i> I'm starving.</i>

738
00:37:24.443 --> 00:37:29.045
Actually, Miriam? I'd like
to talk to you about something.

739
00:37:29.147 --> 00:37:31.181
This is your tuition bill.

740
00:37:34.386 --> 00:37:36.286
It says here that
you've paid off $7,000

741
00:37:36.388 --> 00:37:38.922
in the last two months.

742
00:37:39.024 --> 00:37:40.890
At first I thought it was
some kind of mistake.

743
00:37:40.993 --> 00:37:42.993
I called the billing department.

744
00:37:43.095 --> 00:37:44.861
How did you pay that?

745
00:37:44.963 --> 00:37:51.868
Well, you guys said to get
a job and, well,

746
00:37:51.970 --> 00:37:57.207
I've just been getting people
pot in my building.

747
00:37:57.309 --> 00:37:59.909
You've been selling marijuana
to other kids?

748
00:38:00.012 --> 00:38:02.012
Well, I mean, mom, it's
legal here in Washington,

749
00:38:02.114 --> 00:38:03.213
it's really not
that big a deal.

750
00:38:03.315 --> 00:38:04.948
It may be legal here
but it most certainly

751
00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:06.516
is not in North Carolina.

752
00:38:06.618 --> 00:38:07.951
You could get expelled
from school!

753
00:38:08.053 --> 00:38:08.985
You could get arrested!

754
00:38:09.087 --> 00:38:10.153
Mommy, please calm down.

755
00:38:10.255 --> 00:38:11.321
I will not!

756
00:38:11.423 --> 00:38:12.989
Well, I mean, everyone
on campus smokes

757
00:38:13.091 --> 00:38:14.924
and it's safer than drinking,
frankly.

758
00:38:15.027 --> 00:38:17.927
Mir, it's probably a felony
there, it's the south.

759
00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:21.464
What were you thinking?

760
00:38:21.566 --> 00:38:23.066
I... I don't know.

761
00:38:23.168 --> 00:38:25.769
I guess I just thought it would
be easy money.

762
00:38:25.871 --> 00:38:27.437
No amount of money
is worth risking

763
00:38:27.539 --> 00:38:28.972
your personal reputation,

764
00:38:29.074 --> 00:38:30.840
nor the reputation
of this family.

765
00:38:30.942 --> 00:38:35.979
Something like this could follow
you for the rest of your life.

766
00:38:36.081 --> 00:38:38.415
I- I guess I didn't think
it through.

767
00:38:38.517 --> 00:38:39.749
It was a one-time thing.

768
00:38:39.851 --> 00:38:42.852
I won't do it again.

769
00:38:42.954 --> 00:38:45.088
You're not gonna tell dad,
are you?

770
00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:47.924
Well, I won't lie to him.

771
00:38:48.026 --> 00:38:51.227
But I will wait until he
gets home from Afghanistan.

772
00:38:51.330 --> 00:38:53.830
He doesn't need this kind
of stress, too.

773
00:38:57.202 --> 00:38:58.635
Seriously, Mir.

774
00:38:58.737 --> 00:39:01.971
How could you possibly think
this is ok?

775
00:39:02.074 --> 00:39:04.474
( message alert )

776
00:39:13.885 --> 00:39:17.554
Hey, mom?

777
00:39:17.656 --> 00:39:21.257
So... you remember I was telling
you about that women's charity

778
00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:24.027
I'm involved with on campus?

779
00:39:24.129 --> 00:39:26.029
Yes.

780
00:39:26.131 --> 00:39:29.199
Well, uh... I'm organizing
a fundraiser

781
00:39:29.301 --> 00:39:33.403
so I'm gonna need to head home
two days early.

782
00:39:33.505 --> 00:39:36.740
So you're not gonna be here
for New Year's.

783
00:39:36.842 --> 00:39:39.509
Well, I can say no,

784
00:39:39.611 --> 00:39:41.945
but it's just for a really
good cause

785
00:39:42.047 --> 00:39:45.715
and they really need someone
with organizational skills.

786
00:39:45.817 --> 00:39:48.017
No, I think you should do it.

787
00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:49.185
It's good to stay engaged

788
00:39:49.287 --> 00:39:51.187
with causes that you're
passionate about.

789
00:39:51.289 --> 00:39:53.790
It's like Father Young
was saying in church today:

790
00:39:53.892 --> 00:39:56.693
it's important to give back.

791
00:40:01.299 --> 00:40:04.100
Hey, Mir?

792
00:40:04.202 --> 00:40:05.835
What's going on?

793
00:40:05.937 --> 00:40:07.170
Nothing.

794
00:40:07.272 --> 00:40:08.671
Because you can always
talk to me.

795
00:40:08.774 --> 00:40:10.573
About anything. Ok?

796
00:40:10.675 --> 00:40:13.243
I'm always here for you.

797
00:40:13.345 --> 00:40:16.579
I know.

798
00:40:16.681 --> 00:40:18.748
I just gotta get back
to school.

799
00:40:24.356 --> 00:40:25.889
( doorbell rings )

800
00:40:27.359 --> 00:40:28.825
Ah, there you are.

801
00:40:28.927 --> 00:40:30.827
Sorry, my flight was delayed.

802
00:40:30.929 --> 00:40:32.929
We gotta get you in makeup.

803
00:40:33.031 --> 00:40:35.231
You have four scenes
in two days,

804
00:40:35.333 --> 00:40:38.168
and on Monday your scene
is a great opportunity.

805
00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:39.602
Well, I have class Monday.

806
00:40:39.704 --> 00:40:41.805
I have to take the redeye
Sunday.

807
00:40:41.907 --> 00:40:44.574
Your loss. They want
you on set in 20.

808
00:40:46.978 --> 00:40:48.311
Turn me into Belle.

I am so psyched for rush week!

00:41:27.986 --> 00:41:29.619
I really want to get
into Theta Tao.

822
00:41:29.721 --> 00:41:31.688
They throw the best parties.

823
00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:33.089
Are you really gonna rush?

824
00:41:33.191 --> 00:41:34.724
It seems so brutal.

825
00:41:34.826 --> 00:41:37.093
Well, Jeff is a legacy pledge
because of his dad

826
00:41:37.195 --> 00:41:38.761
so he's got a better shot.

827
00:41:38.864 --> 00:41:40.497
Well, I still have to make
a good impression.

828
00:41:40.599 --> 00:41:42.298
I mean, they have to want
you around.

829
00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:45.568
The whole Greek thing seems
kind of arcane to me.

830
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:47.270
You hear that?

831
00:41:47.372 --> 00:41:48.738
Fun is coming!

832
00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:50.139
( squealing )

833
00:41:50.242 --> 00:41:51.407
Hey, Miriam.

834
00:41:53.712 --> 00:41:54.677
Can I ask you something?

835
00:41:54.779 --> 00:41:56.613
Yeah, sure.

836
00:41:56.715 --> 00:42:01.251
Are you in a porn movie?

837
00:42:01.353 --> 00:42:02.986
What're you talking about?

838
00:42:03.088 --> 00:42:04.153
'Cause if not,
then there's this girl

839
00:42:04.256 --> 00:42:05.555
who looks exactly like you.

840
00:42:05.657 --> 00:42:06.823
Like, exactly.

841
00:42:06.925 --> 00:42:10.126
And she even sounds like you
and, well, I mean...

842
00:42:10.228 --> 00:42:12.028
Belle Knox...

843
00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:13.963
it's you, isn't it?

844
00:42:17.903 --> 00:42:19.736
I don't- I don't know
what you're talking about.

845
00:42:19.838 --> 00:42:21.371
I don't- I don't know
who that is.

846
00:42:21.473 --> 00:42:22.572
I guess I have a doppleganger.

847
00:42:22.674 --> 00:42:23.673
So you have a twin sister

848
00:42:23.775 --> 00:42:26.509
who is also a women's
studies major?

849
00:42:26.611 --> 00:42:28.711
Oh, hey, hey, don't get upset.

850
00:42:28.813 --> 00:42:30.413
Jeff, we're friends, right?

851
00:42:30.515 --> 00:42:32.181
Yes. Of course.

852
00:42:32.284 --> 00:42:33.683
I need you to promise me

853
00:42:33.785 --> 00:42:35.919
that you're not gonna
tell anybody, ok?

854
00:42:36.021 --> 00:42:39.822
If anybody finds out about this
my life is over.

855
00:42:39.925 --> 00:42:41.658
Please.

856
00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:43.927
Ok. I won't.

857
00:42:44.029 --> 00:42:46.262
Pinky swear.

858
00:42:46.364 --> 00:42:48.197
Yeah. Pinky swear.

859
00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:11.988
What's up?

860
00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:14.023
Are you ok?

861
00:43:14.125 --> 00:43:16.092
Yeah.

862
00:43:16.194 --> 00:43:18.161
I'm just not really in it
to win it tonight.

863
00:43:18.263 --> 00:43:20.296
Ugh. I feel you.

864
00:43:20.398 --> 00:43:28.571
Hey, Mr. Kennedy's
talking to Jeff.

865
00:43:28.673 --> 00:43:32.875
What do you think
they're talking about?

866
00:43:32.978 --> 00:43:35.078
You know what,
I have to go.

867
00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:38.815
Ok. I'll see you later.

868
00:43:53.465 --> 00:43:54.397
What?

869
00:43:54.499 --> 00:43:59.335
( multiple notifications )

870
00:43:59.437 --> 00:44:01.771
Hey, what's wrong?

871
00:44:01.873 --> 00:44:04.307
Nothing.

872
00:44:04.409 --> 00:44:08.444
I'm just... feeling really
stressed about school.

873
00:44:08.546 --> 00:44:10.513
It's ok.

874
00:44:10.615 --> 00:44:14.484
Freshman year can
be overwhelming.

875
00:44:14.586 --> 00:44:17.887
Go back to sleep.

876
00:44:21.192 --> 00:44:22.058
( whispering ) Dude, it's early!

877
00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:23.426
My roommates
are asleep!

878
00:44:23.528 --> 00:44:27.463
Did you tell them?

879
00:44:27.565 --> 00:44:28.698
Oh, crap.

880
00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.033
I guess something
may have slipped.

881
00:44:30.135 --> 00:44:33.469
Half the frats friended
me last night.

882
00:44:33.571 --> 00:44:35.505
I'm so sorry, Miriam. Ok?

883
00:44:35.607 --> 00:44:37.073
I guess 'cause it's rush
and I had been drinking

884
00:44:37.175 --> 00:44:38.608
and the guys started razzing me.

885
00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:39.742
So they've all seen it?

886
00:44:39.844 --> 00:44:43.246
You showed them?

887
00:44:43.348 --> 00:44:44.580
I'm really, really sorry.

888
00:44:44.683 --> 00:44:45.415
You should be!

889
00:44:45.517 --> 00:44:46.883
My life is over!

890
00:44:46.985 --> 00:44:48.451
You must have known that this
would get out eventually!

891
00:44:48.553 --> 00:44:50.420
It's on the internet!

892
00:44:54.392 --> 00:44:55.825
Miriam...

893
00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:04.100
Oh my gosh,
did you hear?

894
00:45:04.202 --> 00:45:06.402
There's a freshman
who's a porn star.

895
00:45:06.504 --> 00:45:08.604
It's all over the collegiate
ACB.

896
00:45:16.381 --> 00:45:19.449
Yeah, uh... I know.

897
00:45:22.921 --> 00:45:24.454
It's me.

898
00:45:31.996 --> 00:45:34.397
What do you mean,
it's you?

899
00:45:34.499 --> 00:45:36.666
I'm the porn star.

900
00:45:42.874 --> 00:45:45.374
What are you talking about?

901
00:45:46.778 --> 00:45:48.411
I didn't go home
for Thanksgiving

902
00:45:48.513 --> 00:45:51.681
and I didn't visit my friend
at Georgetown.

903
00:45:51.783 --> 00:45:54.884
I've been flying to LA
to shoot porn scenes.

904
00:45:54.986 --> 00:45:57.820
What? Why?

905
00:45:57.922 --> 00:46:01.390
I really need to pay for school
and you can make a lot of money

906
00:46:01.493 --> 00:46:05.862
and we had
kinda joked about it.

907
00:46:05.964 --> 00:46:09.932
So you've just been lying
to me?

908
00:46:10.034 --> 00:46:12.602
I didn't want anyone to know.

909
00:46:12.704 --> 00:46:14.003
I didn't want it to get out.

910
00:46:14.105 --> 00:46:15.972
Why didn't you just tell me?

911
00:46:16.074 --> 00:46:19.976
You have been such
a great friend,

912
00:46:20.078 --> 00:46:25.314
but I didn't want you to think
less of me.

913
00:46:25.416 --> 00:46:28.551
Listen, I don't care
what you do.

914
00:46:28.653 --> 00:46:30.486
As long as you don't lie
to me.

915
00:46:30.588 --> 00:46:32.588
Ok.

916
00:46:34.292 --> 00:46:36.659
This person says I should
get expelled.

917
00:46:36.761 --> 00:46:40.596
"What a whore, her nose
is bigger than her tits."

918
00:46:40.698 --> 00:46:44.200
This is crazy.

919
00:46:44.302 --> 00:46:47.603
"She should just kill herself
and do everybody a favour."

920
00:46:47.705 --> 00:46:49.705
"She deserves
to get raped."

921
00:46:49.808 --> 00:46:51.374
They're just trolls.

922
00:46:51.476 --> 00:46:53.576
Nobody posted my name,
right?

923
00:46:53.678 --> 00:46:54.911
No.

924
00:46:55.013 --> 00:46:56.913
But people are gonna
find out.

925
00:46:57.015 --> 00:46:58.581
You know that, right?

926
00:46:58.683 --> 00:47:00.316
There are so many porn
actresses out there,

927
00:47:00.418 --> 00:47:05.922
I just thought it was impossible
for somebody to recognize me.

928
00:47:06.024 --> 00:47:07.456
I mean, I thought I could just
go under the radar.

929
00:47:07.559 --> 00:47:09.826
How could I have been
so stupid?

930
00:47:09.928 --> 00:47:12.228
Look, there are supportive
comments, too.

931
00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:15.298
"Who cares? It's her
body, not yours."

932
00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:17.033
Look.

933
00:47:17.135 --> 00:47:19.202
There's a message
from a girl named Amanda.

934
00:47:19.304 --> 00:47:20.803
Does she want to call me
a whore, too?

935
00:47:20.905 --> 00:47:22.672
Actually, she works
for the school paper.

936
00:47:22.774 --> 00:47:24.207
She wants to talk to you.

937
00:47:24.309 --> 00:47:25.975
Uh, no.

938
00:47:26.077 --> 00:47:28.711
I think it might be
a good idea.

939
00:47:28.813 --> 00:47:31.547
You don't deserve
to be harassed.

940
00:47:37.355 --> 00:47:38.454
Hi.

941
00:47:38.556 --> 00:47:39.388
Uh... I'm Miriam.

942
00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:41.157
Amanda. Wanna sit?

943
00:47:44.929 --> 00:47:46.028
I don't know about this.

944
00:47:46.130 --> 00:47:47.029
I get it.

945
00:47:47.131 --> 00:47:48.464
Gossip spreads fast
on campus.

946
00:47:48.566 --> 00:47:49.832
It's only gonna get rougher,
too.

947
00:47:49.934 --> 00:47:51.167
Right.

948
00:47:51.269 --> 00:47:52.635
And some of the frats and
sororities know who I am,

949
00:47:52.737 --> 00:47:54.904
but my name isn't
totally out there.

950
00:47:55.006 --> 00:47:57.473
For the purposes of my article
I can use an alias.

951
00:47:57.575 --> 00:47:58.641
Whatever you're
comfortable with.

952
00:47:58.743 --> 00:48:02.278
And I promise to be fair.

953
00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:03.813
I just don't know.

954
00:48:03.915 --> 00:48:07.316
This is your chance
to tell your side.

955
00:48:07.418 --> 00:48:09.252
Don't you want to make
lemonade?

956
00:48:13.958 --> 00:48:19.295
You know, the guy who outed
me was watching hardcore porn

957
00:48:19.397 --> 00:48:23.099
and yet I'm the one
who's being called a slut.

958
00:48:23.201 --> 00:48:25.768
Because somehow creating
the content is more shameful

959
00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:27.870
than consuming it?

960
00:48:27.972 --> 00:48:29.906
It's a double standard.

961
00:48:30.008 --> 00:48:33.876
So doing porn, for you,
is a feminist act?

962
00:48:34.979 --> 00:48:35.611
Yeah, in a way.

963
00:48:35.713 --> 00:48:36.512
Is that why you're doing it?

964
00:48:36.614 --> 00:48:38.347
I'm doing it because
I need money.

965
00:48:38.449 --> 00:48:42.118
My parents can't afford the
$60,000 a year tuition at Duke

966
00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:44.987
and I don't want to be
in debt for the rest of my life.

967
00:48:45.089 --> 00:48:46.422
I mean, if I waitressed
part-time

968
00:48:46.524 --> 00:48:51.527
I would maybe make $400 a month,
and it's degrading.

969
00:48:51.629 --> 00:48:55.097
You don't find porn degrading?

970
00:48:55.199 --> 00:48:58.901
Actually, it's empowering.

971
00:48:59.003 --> 00:49:02.405
I get to have this alter-ego.

972
00:49:02.507 --> 00:49:06.442
It's like Miriam is this
serious, studious, nerdy girl

973
00:49:06.544 --> 00:49:12.415
and then Belle is this sexy,
mischievous, uninhibited minx.

974
00:49:12.517 --> 00:49:15.651
Yeah, but... aren't most
of the directors men?

975
00:49:15.753 --> 00:49:17.453
And then the way that
these women are shown,

976
00:49:17.555 --> 00:49:20.823
usually helpless, disposable
sex toys

977
00:49:20.925 --> 00:49:23.426
that exist only to pleasure men.

978
00:49:23.528 --> 00:49:26.996
It's true, a lot of
the directors are men.

979
00:49:27.098 --> 00:49:29.665
But maybe it's time
that that changed.

980
00:49:29.767 --> 00:49:31.801
And there's a lot of different
kinds of porn

981
00:49:31.903 --> 00:49:33.736
for different sexual
preferences.

982
00:49:33.838 --> 00:49:35.638
You know, a lot of women,
myself included,

983
00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:39.608
are really turned on by BDSM
and sexual domination.

984
00:49:39.711 --> 00:49:43.879
My sexual preference doesn't
make me any less feminist.

985
00:49:48.419 --> 00:49:50.653
They're all looking at me.

986
00:49:50.755 --> 00:49:52.488
You think they know?

987
00:49:52.590 --> 00:49:54.924
Yeah. They're laughing.

988
00:49:55.026 --> 00:49:58.828
It's like I'm wearing a
scarlet letter or something.

989
00:49:58.930 --> 00:50:01.664
So what do your parents think?

990
00:50:01.766 --> 00:50:05.034
Oh, no. They can't find out.

991
00:50:05.136 --> 00:50:08.137
They're really Catholic
and really conservative

992
00:50:08.239 --> 00:50:11.273
and I know that they would
just freak out.

993
00:50:11.376 --> 00:50:13.142
I mean, my mom would
probably disown me.

994
00:50:13.244 --> 00:50:16.545
They still think I'm a virgin.

995
00:50:16.647 --> 00:50:18.581
I have to get to class.

996
00:50:18.683 --> 00:50:21.650
Ok. Thanks for talking with me.

997
00:50:21.753 --> 00:50:23.619
No, thank you.

998
00:50:23.721 --> 00:50:26.756
I'm really looking forward
to your article.

999
00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:44.040
Slut.

1000
00:52:04.188 --> 00:52:07.289
Thank you for being here
for me.

1001
00:52:07.391 --> 00:52:09.258
It really means a lot.

1002
00:52:11.729 --> 00:52:13.829
I don't have anyone else
to talk to.

1003
00:52:13.931 --> 00:52:15.631
Girl, I got you.

1004
00:52:15.733 --> 00:52:17.933
Everything's gonna be ok.

1005
00:52:18.035 --> 00:52:20.636
You can't let a few a-holes
get to you.

1006
00:52:25.610 --> 00:52:27.042
Hi ladies.

1007
00:52:27.145 --> 00:52:30.312
What brings you to the women's
centre today?

1008
00:52:30.414 --> 00:52:33.949
Last week somebody
put this sign on my door.

1009
00:52:34.051 --> 00:52:37.052
This morning I got a death
threat on my Facebook account.

1010
00:52:37.155 --> 00:52:39.522
The messages I get
are awful.

1011
00:52:39.624 --> 00:52:42.158
That I should kill myself,
I should get expelled.

1012
00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:44.460
I've had garbage thrown
at me.

1013
00:52:44.562 --> 00:52:45.728
I don't know what to do.

1014
00:52:45.830 --> 00:52:47.630
I'm sorry this is happening
to you.

1015
00:52:47.732 --> 00:52:49.465
We are 100 percent here
to support you

1016
00:52:49.567 --> 00:52:52.067
and the university is here
to support you as well, ok?

1017
00:52:52.170 --> 00:52:54.270
We have a zero
tolerance policy

1018
00:52:54.372 --> 00:52:56.172
when it comes to this type
of harassment-

1019
00:52:56.274 --> 00:52:58.574
And it's not just one person,
either.

1020
00:52:58.676 --> 00:53:00.309
Would you like me to speak
to the resident's advisor?

1021
00:53:00.411 --> 00:53:02.311
We could see about moving
your room?

1022
00:53:02.413 --> 00:53:04.180
Maybe to a non-co-ed building.

1023
00:53:04.282 --> 00:53:06.549
No, I love being
Jolie's roommate.

1024
00:53:06.651 --> 00:53:09.685
Ok, well that is an option
if you change your mind.

1025
00:53:09.787 --> 00:53:12.555
So there's no way I'll get
kicked out of school, right?

1026
00:53:12.657 --> 00:53:14.757
No, no. Absolutely not.

1027
00:53:14.859 --> 00:53:17.993
Just so you know, our
perspective is that what you do

1028
00:53:18.095 --> 00:53:20.629
in your own time and how
you choose to make a living,

1029
00:53:20.731 --> 00:53:24.366
as long as it's legal,
is entirely your choice.

1030
00:53:24.468 --> 00:53:26.869
We do not pass
judgment here.

1031
00:53:29.574 --> 00:53:31.307
I really hope you come forward
with a complaint

1032
00:53:31.409 --> 00:53:33.842
and we can figure
this out together.

1033
00:53:33.945 --> 00:53:36.011
Well, I'm not ready to do that.

1034
00:53:36.113 --> 00:53:38.547
At least not yet.

1035
00:53:42.620 --> 00:53:44.086
Thank you so much.

1036
00:53:44.188 --> 00:53:45.821
You've been super helpful.

1037
00:53:45.923 --> 00:53:48.991
Yeah, I actually feel
a little better.

1038
00:53:49.093 --> 00:53:50.359
Good, I'm glad.

1039
00:53:50.461 --> 00:53:52.695
I really think you should reach
out to your family.

1040
00:53:52.797 --> 00:53:54.363
It can be difficult
being isolated

1041
00:53:54.465 --> 00:53:55.864
and if you're feeling bullied

1042
00:53:55.967 --> 00:53:59.501
it's incredibly important you
have a strong support network.

1043
00:53:59.604 --> 00:54:00.903
<i> The stress of trying</i>
<i> to keep a secret</i>

1044
00:54:01.005 --> 00:54:03.839
<i> can often be worse</i>
<i> than coming clean.</i>

1045
00:54:06.911 --> 00:54:08.377
<i> Thanks ladies.</i>

1046
00:54:10.581 --> 00:54:12.248
You guys?

1047
00:54:12.350 --> 00:54:14.416
The article got published.

1048
00:54:20.458 --> 00:54:21.991
Amanda totally lied.

1049
00:54:22.093 --> 00:54:23.425
She said she'd be fair.

1050
00:54:23.527 --> 00:54:26.028
She gave you an alias like
she said she would.

1051
00:54:26.130 --> 00:54:28.197
"Missy makes a compelling
argument.

1052
00:54:28.299 --> 00:54:30.065
"I'm a feminist and to me
that means taking agency

1053
00:54:30.167 --> 00:54:32.134
"over my personal liberty
and my right to choose

1054
00:54:32.236 --> 00:54:33.636
"what to do with my body."

1055
00:54:33.738 --> 00:54:35.104
This is really flattering.

1056
00:54:35.206 --> 00:54:36.872
I don't understand
why you're so upset.

1057
00:54:36.974 --> 00:54:38.974
She makes me sound like
I contradict myself.

1058
00:54:39.076 --> 00:54:40.876
Then she says I'm insecure
and that makes me sound like

1059
00:54:40.978 --> 00:54:44.413
I'm some first-year woman
seeking approval or something.

1060
00:54:44.515 --> 00:54:46.548
She said to make lemonade.

1061
00:54:46.651 --> 00:54:47.783
I don't know.

1062
00:54:47.885 --> 00:54:49.485
I thought she made you sound
pretty good.

1063
00:54:49.587 --> 00:54:51.620
Well, I'm not some insecure,
first-year woman.

1064
00:54:51.722 --> 00:54:53.289
She reduced me to a cliché.

1065
00:54:53.391 --> 00:54:55.457
I think she made you seem
really human.

1066
00:54:55.559 --> 00:54:56.759
And vulnerable.

1067
00:54:56.861 --> 00:54:58.460
I don't want pity.

1068
00:54:58.562 --> 00:55:01.530
I want people to understand
that this is about empowerment.

1069
00:55:01.632 --> 00:55:02.531
I get that, but-

1070
00:55:02.633 --> 00:55:03.832
You know what?

1071
00:55:03.934 --> 00:55:05.401
Let's go to The Foundry tonight.

1072
00:55:05.503 --> 00:55:06.502
I need to get out.

1073
00:55:06.604 --> 00:55:08.037
Really?

1074
00:55:16.747 --> 00:55:17.579
Oh no.

1075
00:55:17.682 --> 00:55:19.615
Look who's here.

1076
00:55:22.219 --> 00:55:23.185
It's fine.

1077
00:55:23.287 --> 00:55:25.454
I'm fine.

1078
00:55:25.556 --> 00:55:27.256
Really.

1079
00:55:31.762 --> 00:55:33.195
Hey.

1080
00:55:33.297 --> 00:55:35.431
Oh, hi.

1081
00:55:35.533 --> 00:55:36.965
How're you doing?

1082
00:55:37.068 --> 00:55:38.801
Pretty good. How about you?

1083
00:55:38.903 --> 00:55:40.069
I'm all good.

1084
00:55:40.171 --> 00:55:42.805
What're you doing later?

1085
00:55:42.907 --> 00:55:45.341
Uh... I don't know.

1086
00:55:45.443 --> 00:55:47.042
You wanna hang out?

1087
00:55:47.144 --> 00:55:48.944
Yeah, that would-
that would be awesome.

1088
00:55:49.046 --> 00:55:50.245
Cool.

1089
00:55:50.348 --> 00:55:51.947
So you wanna meet me and
my buddies back at the dorm?

1090
00:55:54.251 --> 00:55:56.385
What buddies?

1091
00:55:56.487 --> 00:55:57.720
( laughs )

1092
00:55:57.822 --> 00:55:59.388
Come on, Belle. It'll be fun.

1093
00:55:59.490 --> 00:56:01.390
We can make a video
of our own.

1094
00:56:01.492 --> 00:56:04.593
I mean, that's-
that's your thing, right?

1095
00:56:10.901 --> 00:56:14.570
( knocking )

1096
00:56:14.672 --> 00:56:16.205
<i> ( Guy ): Hey, slut!</i>

1097
00:56:16.307 --> 00:56:18.140
<i> ( Gu</i> y 2<i> ): Hey Belle, wanna</i>
<i> make</i>
<i> a movie?</i>

1098
00:56:18.242 --> 00:56:20.642
<i> ( Guy ): Come on out,</i>
<i> we know you're horny!</i>

1099
00:56:20.745 --> 00:56:21.910
Hey!

1100
00:56:22.012 --> 00:56:23.812
Campus security is
on its way!

1101
00:56:23.914 --> 00:56:25.681
You better get out of here!

1102
00:56:27.351 --> 00:56:29.985
What am I supposed to do?

1103
00:56:33.491 --> 00:56:35.224
They're gone.

1104
00:56:35.326 --> 00:56:37.459
But they're not gonna stop.

1105
00:56:37.561 --> 00:56:39.695
And my name's not Belle,
it's Miriam.

1106
00:56:39.797 --> 00:56:42.598
It's fantasy! She's a character!

1107
00:56:44.902 --> 00:56:46.135
Excuse me, professor.

1108
00:56:46.237 --> 00:56:49.371
I have a question
about my thesis.

1109
00:56:50.574 --> 00:56:51.507
No. No, no, no.

1110
00:56:51.609 --> 00:56:52.174
I'm sorry.

1111
00:56:52.276 --> 00:56:53.442
Don?

1112
00:56:53.544 --> 00:56:55.043
What's the problem?

1113
00:56:55.146 --> 00:56:57.813
I was not told that the actor
would be, like, 50.

1114
00:56:57.915 --> 00:56:59.848
I've been super clear that
I don't wanna book any scenes

1115
00:56:59.950 --> 00:57:02.284
with any co-star over 35.

1116
00:57:02.386 --> 00:57:03.152
You were serious?

1117
00:57:03.254 --> 00:57:04.420
Yes.

1118
00:57:04.522 --> 00:57:05.754
Well, I apologize,
it'll never happen again.

1119
00:57:05.856 --> 00:57:07.356
But the crew is here
and they're ready to work.

1120
00:57:07.458 --> 00:57:09.291
Let's go.

1121
00:57:09.393 --> 00:57:11.360
I'm not comfortable with this.

1122
00:57:11.462 --> 00:57:13.362
If you don't do the scene
you'll be labeled "difficult".

1123
00:57:13.464 --> 00:57:15.898
It's your call.

1124
00:57:18.235 --> 00:57:20.636
That's a good girl.

1125
00:57:24.241 --> 00:57:26.074
<i> And action.</i>

1126
00:57:26.177 --> 00:57:27.409
Excuse me, professor?

1127
00:57:27.511 --> 00:57:31.880
I have a question
about my thesis.

1128
00:57:31.982 --> 00:57:34.516
( moaning )

1129
00:57:34.618 --> 00:57:35.484
Oh, yes!

1130
00:57:35.586 --> 00:57:36.552
Oh yeah, baby!

1131
00:57:36.654 --> 00:57:37.686
Oh, right there.

1132
00:57:37.788 --> 00:57:38.454
Don't stop.

1133
00:57:38.556 --> 00:57:39.421
Yes!

1134
00:57:39.523 --> 00:57:41.056
( moaning )

1135
00:57:41.158 --> 00:57:42.791
<i> Cut!</i>

1136
00:58:01.378 --> 00:58:04.346
They're not ready
for my scene yet.

1137
00:58:04.448 --> 00:58:06.048
You're studying again?

1138
00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:07.249
How's school?

1139
00:58:07.351 --> 00:58:09.284
I have so much work
to do over the weekend.

1140
00:58:09.386 --> 00:58:13.455
And honestly I'm having a hard
time concentrating on anything.

1141
00:58:13.557 --> 00:58:17.493
Now that I got outed on campus
it has been so stressful.

1142
00:58:17.595 --> 00:58:19.695
Did you talk to
your parents yet?

1143
00:58:19.797 --> 00:58:21.563
No, I can't.

1144
00:58:21.665 --> 00:58:23.732
You have to.
They're gonna find out.

1145
00:58:23.834 --> 00:58:25.834
What if they never wanna talk
to me again?

1146
00:58:25.936 --> 00:58:28.871
No matter what, it's better
that it comes from you.

1147
00:58:28.973 --> 00:58:30.105
Just do it.

1148
00:58:30.207 --> 00:58:31.974
If you're afraid to call
you can text.

1149
00:58:32.076 --> 00:58:33.675
Does your mom text?

1150
00:58:33.777 --> 00:58:37.346
It's like pulling
a Band-Aid off.

1151
00:58:47.691 --> 00:58:50.859
It's gonna be ok.

1152
00:58:50.961 --> 00:58:53.695
I don't know if it is.

1153
00:59:01.805 --> 00:59:02.971
( phone rings )

1154
00:59:03.073 --> 00:59:04.172
What do I do?

1155
00:59:04.275 --> 00:59:06.041
It's ok. Take a deep breath.

1156
00:59:07.978 --> 00:59:10.145
You can do this.

1157
00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:17.119
Mom?

1158
00:59:17.221 --> 00:59:18.987
<i> Miriam, what are you</i>
<i> talking about?</i>

1159
00:59:19.089 --> 00:59:21.890
<i> What does this text</i>
<i> even mean?</i>

1160
00:59:21.992 --> 00:59:27.663
Mom, um... I wasn't selling
pot last semester.

1161
00:59:27.765 --> 00:59:29.798
I was filming adult videos.

1162
00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:32.200
<i> What? Pornography?</i>

1163
00:59:34.138 --> 00:59:35.671
No, you can't be serious.

1164
00:59:35.773 --> 00:59:38.907
Well, I mean, porn
is just a business

1165
00:59:39.009 --> 00:59:40.776
and it's an honest job.

1166
00:59:40.878 --> 00:59:42.210
What are you thinking?

1167
00:59:42.313 --> 00:59:44.780
I knew that you and dad had
enough financial pressure on you

1168
00:59:44.882 --> 00:59:47.683
and I didn't wanna add
to your stress.

1169
00:59:47.785 --> 00:59:50.252
Mom, believe me,
it's gonna be fine.

1170
00:59:50.354 --> 00:59:52.955
<i> No, it's not gonna be fine.</i>

1171
00:59:53.057 --> 00:59:56.124
<i> Do you understand</i>
<i> what you've done?</i>

1172
00:59:56.226 --> 00:59:59.261
All the hard work,
all your accomplishments?

1173
00:59:59.363 --> 01:00:01.163
<i> You've just thrown</i>
<i> them away!</i>

1174
01:00:01.265 --> 01:00:03.665
( sobbing )

1175
01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:08.036
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

1176
01:00:08.138 --> 01:00:10.339
<i> I've gotta go.</i>

1177
01:00:10.441 --> 01:00:16.845
( sobbing )

1178
01:00:18.616 --> 01:00:19.815
Giles is an all-women's hall

1179
01:00:19.917 --> 01:00:22.351
so hopefully it'll be
a little more quiet.

1180
01:00:22.453 --> 01:00:25.320
I hope so. I hate moving.

1181
01:00:28.425 --> 01:00:30.058
I'm gonna miss you.

1182
01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:33.629
Hello, I'll be over
all the time.

1183
01:00:33.731 --> 01:00:35.797
Skank.

1184
01:00:35.899 --> 01:00:37.499
( laughing )

1185
01:00:37.601 --> 01:00:39.835
Ignore them.

1186
01:00:39.937 --> 01:00:41.737
No. You know what?

1187
01:00:41.839 --> 01:00:44.606
I'm not gonna ignore them.

1188
01:00:44.708 --> 01:00:46.174
Hey, what'd you say?

1189
01:00:46.276 --> 01:00:47.242
Nothing.

1190
01:00:47.344 --> 01:00:48.377
No, actually you called me
a skank

1191
01:00:48.479 --> 01:00:50.078
but now you're not gonna
say it to my face.

1192
01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:51.413
You don't have to get
all psycho.

1193
01:00:51.515 --> 01:00:53.682
Wow. Psycho and skank?

1194
01:00:53.784 --> 01:00:55.317
Because that's what women
who speak their minds

1195
01:00:55.419 --> 01:00:57.853
and make decisions about
their own bodies are, right?

1196
01:00:57.955 --> 01:00:59.254
But you're, like, doing people
for money.

1197
01:00:59.356 --> 01:01:00.722
I mean, it's embarrassing.

1198
01:01:00.824 --> 01:01:02.090
I made a choice.

1199
01:01:02.192 --> 01:01:03.525
You don't have to agree with it,

1200
01:01:03.627 --> 01:01:05.494
but the fact you fell the need
to discriminate against me

1201
01:01:05.596 --> 01:01:08.597
and shame me is really sad.

1202
01:01:12.903 --> 01:01:14.436
Good for you.

1203
01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:18.306
Come on.

1204
01:01:18.409 --> 01:01:19.374
( phone ringing )

1205
01:01:19.476 --> 01:01:21.243
Oh, hold on.
I'll be right there.

1206
01:01:24.314 --> 01:01:25.447
Hello?

1207
01:01:25.549 --> 01:01:26.515
<i> Can I speak with Miriam Weeks</i>
<i> please.</i>

1208
01:01:26.617 --> 01:01:28.550
This is she.

1209
01:01:30.421 --> 01:01:32.320
Hey.

1210
01:01:32.423 --> 01:01:36.258
So... that was someone
from CNN.

1211
01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:37.859
They want to interview me.

1212
01:01:37.961 --> 01:01:39.227
Really?

1213
01:01:39.329 --> 01:01:41.697
I think I'm gonna do it.

1214
01:01:47.271 --> 01:01:49.171
My next guest was just another
student at Duke University.

1215
01:01:49.273 --> 01:01:52.240
Now she's known as Belle
Knox and she's acting in porn

1216
01:01:52.342 --> 01:01:53.475
to pay her tuition.

1217
01:01:53.577 --> 01:01:55.243
You are probably right now
pound-for-pound

1218
01:01:55.345 --> 01:01:57.813
the most infamous student
in America.

1219
01:01:57.915 --> 01:01:59.047
How do you feel about that?

1220
01:01:59.149 --> 01:02:01.283
It's totally surreal.

1221
01:02:01.385 --> 01:02:04.052
I mean, suddenly all these
strangers know who I am

1222
01:02:04.154 --> 01:02:05.887
and have an opinion about me.

1223
01:02:05.989 --> 01:02:07.956
I could have never
imagined this.

1224
01:02:08.058 --> 01:02:10.459
As a feminist, as a woman
in women's studies,

1225
01:02:10.561 --> 01:02:13.695
taking part in porno-
pornographic scenes

1226
01:02:13.797 --> 01:02:15.397
sort of puts uncomfortable,

1227
01:02:15.499 --> 01:02:17.933
unnecessary stereotypes
about there for-

1228
01:02:18.035 --> 01:02:20.335
for lots of men to think is
the norm.

1229
01:02:20.437 --> 01:02:23.939
To me, feminism is not about
acting masculine or feminine,

1230
01:02:24.041 --> 01:02:27.142
it's about having the right
to act in any way we choose.

1231
01:02:27.244 --> 01:02:28.643
There will be lots of people
watching this

1232
01:02:28.746 --> 01:02:32.714
who will be feigning outrage
and yet, secretly,

1233
01:02:32.816 --> 01:02:36.017
probably looking at porn
quite regularly themselves.

1234
01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:37.786
Do you think there's a hypocrisy

1235
01:02:37.888 --> 01:02:40.722
in the way that people treat
pornography in America?

1236
01:02:40.824 --> 01:02:42.190
Of course.

1237
01:02:42.292 --> 01:02:44.993
You know, something like 80
percent of all online traffic

1238
01:02:45.095 --> 01:02:46.261
goes to porn sites.

1239
01:02:46.363 --> 01:02:47.863
She's only eighteen or nineteen,

1240
01:02:47.965 --> 01:02:50.565
so I think we underestimate
how, you know,

1241
01:02:50.667 --> 01:02:52.167
immature and naive she is.

1242
01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:53.568
<i> Definitely.</i>

1243
01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:55.203
We like to say that, you know,
porn is ok, whatever,

1244
01:02:55.305 --> 01:02:56.271
it's just a job.

1245
01:02:56.373 --> 01:02:57.539
Maybe she doesn't identify
with it.

1246
01:02:57.641 --> 01:02:59.107
She probably thought that
I'm gonna go out there,

1247
01:02:59.209 --> 01:03:01.610
do this, it's just a job,
it's not who I am-

1248
01:03:01.712 --> 01:03:04.346
I think you're right, and...
but...

1249
01:03:04.448 --> 01:03:06.214
also, you gotta own up
to what you do though.

1250
01:03:06.316 --> 01:03:07.849
Because at some point it can
become who you are.

1251
01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:10.051
If I'm honest, I've got a young
daughter, very young,

1252
01:03:10.154 --> 01:03:12.254
only two years old, but if she,
when she is your age,

1253
01:03:12.356 --> 01:03:16.091
decided to do this, I would be
pretty upset as her father.

1254
01:03:16.193 --> 01:03:17.459
( laughs )

1255
01:03:17.561 --> 01:03:19.261
I think the important thing
is whether

1256
01:03:19.363 --> 01:03:21.363
the person is doing it
by choice.

1257
01:03:21.465 --> 01:03:22.631
If you have a choice

1258
01:03:22.733 --> 01:03:25.367
I don't see why anyone
would have a problem.

1259
01:03:25.469 --> 01:03:27.469
<i> The choice for me felt</i>
<i> really natural.</i>

1260
01:03:27.571 --> 01:03:29.838
I've always been very
comfortable with my sexuality

1261
01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:32.541
and I've been watching porn
since I was twelve years old.

1262
01:03:32.643 --> 01:03:33.708
( crowd murmurs )

1263
01:03:33.811 --> 01:03:35.243
You know, you're a guest
on our show,

1264
01:03:35.345 --> 01:03:36.311
I don't- I don't want to
make you feel any kind of bad,

1265
01:03:36.413 --> 01:03:37.679
it just... for someone
to say that

1266
01:03:37.781 --> 01:03:39.381
"I've been watching porn since
I was twelve years old,

1267
01:03:39.483 --> 01:03:40.849
"and it empowers me",

1268
01:03:40.951 --> 01:03:43.318
to me it sounds like you have
something completely memorized,

1269
01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:44.519
uh, that you're saying.

1270
01:03:44.621 --> 01:03:46.087
I just- my heart breaks.

1271
01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:47.055
It really does.

1272
01:03:47.157 --> 01:03:48.490
( crowd cheers )

1273
01:03:48.592 --> 01:03:50.659
Are you getting hostility
from men or women?

1274
01:03:50.761 --> 01:03:52.727
Definitely more from women.

1275
01:03:52.830 --> 01:03:55.664
I can't even go out
without being harassed.

1276
01:03:55.766 --> 01:03:58.266
<i> I think a lot of women feel</i>
<i> insecure having a porn star</i>

1277
01:03:58.368 --> 01:04:01.469
on campus and they're
probably mad

1278
01:04:01.572 --> 01:04:04.573
because their boyfriends
are watching my stuff.

1279
01:04:04.675 --> 01:04:06.708
Did she really just say that?

1280
01:04:06.810 --> 01:04:08.610
What about us?

1281
01:04:08.712 --> 01:04:11.513
We've totally supported her.

1282
01:04:15.485 --> 01:04:16.618
( knocking )

1283
01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:18.153
Come in.

1284
01:04:20.057 --> 01:04:21.456
Hey!

1285
01:04:21.558 --> 01:04:23.425
Did you see Piers Morgan
yesterday?

1286
01:04:23.527 --> 01:04:25.193
He was so brutal.

1287
01:04:25.295 --> 01:04:27.162
That's what I wanted to talk
to you about.

1288
01:04:27.264 --> 01:04:28.897
You really rubbed some people
the wrong way

1289
01:04:28.999 --> 01:04:32.100
when you said women on campus
don't support you.

1290
01:04:32.202 --> 01:04:34.669
Oh, that's not what I meant.

1291
01:04:34.771 --> 01:04:36.438
Well, that's what it
sounded like.

1292
01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:39.841
You have an entire community
of women rallied behind you.

1293
01:04:39.943 --> 01:04:41.409
I mean, maybe that doesn't
work for the story,

1294
01:04:41.511 --> 01:04:43.845
but I just don't think
that's cool.

1295
01:04:43.947 --> 01:04:47.282
Jolie, that's really not
how I meant it.

1296
01:04:47.384 --> 01:04:49.050
I guess I just wasn't thinking.

1297
01:04:49.152 --> 01:04:52.454
Well, if you're gonna be saying
stuff on TV you need to think.

1298
01:04:52.556 --> 01:04:55.557
You can't just say stuff
like that.

1299
01:04:55.659 --> 01:04:57.492
It's ok, I'll get over it.

1300
01:04:57.594 --> 01:04:59.995
I just wanted you to know.

1301
01:05:00.097 --> 01:05:02.931
Ok.

1302
01:05:03.033 --> 01:05:04.699
Are you going to do another
interview?

1303
01:05:04.801 --> 01:05:09.638
No, I'm going home.

1304
01:05:17.481 --> 01:05:18.780
( sighs )

1305
01:05:46.543 --> 01:05:48.143
We just don't understand.

1306
01:05:48.245 --> 01:05:49.678
Why didn't you come to us?

1307
01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:51.846
I knew you guys didn't have
the money.

1308
01:05:56.019 --> 01:06:02.090
You will always be our daughter,
and we love you, Miriam.

1309
01:06:02.192 --> 01:06:05.860
But I'm heartbroken.

1310
01:06:05.963 --> 01:06:08.196
I just don't think you've really
thought through

1311
01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:12.968
what this is going to mean
for the rest of your life.

1312
01:06:13.070 --> 01:06:16.671
I know what I'm doing, daddy.

1313
01:06:16.773 --> 01:06:19.074
Do you?

1314
01:06:24.314 --> 01:06:26.181
Paul.

1315
01:06:30.854 --> 01:06:31.586
Paul, wait!

1316
01:06:31.688 --> 01:06:32.854
Where are you going?

1317
01:06:32.956 --> 01:06:34.489
I have nothing to say to you.

1318
01:06:38.628 --> 01:06:40.795
Paulie...

1319
01:06:50.007 --> 01:06:52.440
So you sell these panties
to old dudes?

1320
01:06:52.542 --> 01:06:55.310
Well, the fans buy them
when you sign autographs

1321
01:06:55.412 --> 01:06:57.178
at these conventions.

1322
01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:00.982
They'll pay, like, 50 bucks,
so...

1323
01:07:01.084 --> 01:07:04.252
Wow, weird.

1324
01:07:04.354 --> 01:07:10.191
It's all part of building
my brand, or whatever.

1325
01:07:10.293 --> 01:07:12.761
I can't believe Paul
won't talk to me.

1326
01:07:12.863 --> 01:07:14.796
Give him time.

1327
01:07:14.898 --> 01:07:17.165
Well, it's really just unfair.

1328
01:07:17.267 --> 01:07:19.167
How did you expect them
to react?

1329
01:07:19.269 --> 01:07:21.269
They're conservative
and Catholic.

1330
01:07:21.371 --> 01:07:23.471
And you're their little girl.

1331
01:07:23.573 --> 01:07:25.440
I just wanted a little support.

1332
01:07:25.542 --> 01:07:29.811
Well, they have a right
to their feelings, too.

1333
01:07:29.913 --> 01:07:31.780
How do you feel?

1334
01:07:31.882 --> 01:07:35.917
I mean... when were
you gonna tell me?

1335
01:07:36.019 --> 01:07:38.086
We've known each other
our entire lives,

1336
01:07:38.188 --> 01:07:41.956
and I kinda feel like I was
the last person to know.

1337
01:07:42.059 --> 01:07:47.228
I really wanted to tell
you, but...

1338
01:07:47.330 --> 01:07:51.966
I guess I thought that if anyone
back here knew about it,

1339
01:07:52.069 --> 01:07:54.636
it would make it real.

1340
01:07:54.738 --> 01:07:56.971
You can't keep the truth
from me like that anymore.

1341
01:07:57.074 --> 01:07:58.073
We're best friends.

1342
01:07:58.175 --> 01:08:01.042
I know. I won't.

1343
01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:11.486
How often do you have
to get tested?

1344
01:08:11.588 --> 01:08:13.855
Every two weeks.

1345
01:08:13.957 --> 01:08:17.559
I have to do it to be able
to film scenes.

1346
01:08:17.661 --> 01:08:19.194
Isn't it scary?

1347
01:08:19.296 --> 01:08:21.996
I mean, aren't you afraid
you're gonna get something?

1348
01:08:22.099 --> 01:08:24.265
Well, yeah, of course.

1349
01:08:24.367 --> 01:08:26.401
But everyone tests,

1350
01:08:26.503 --> 01:08:29.938
so it's safer than hooking up
with guys at school.

1351
01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:33.341
And it's a lot more fun
because it's on my terms.

1352
01:08:33.443 --> 01:08:35.110
Do you really think that?

1353
01:08:35.212 --> 01:08:36.744
Yeah, I do.

1354
01:08:36.847 --> 01:08:40.348
I mean, when I'm in porn land
I feel welcomed.

1355
01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:43.418
Like those are my peers.

1356
01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:46.821
You can be whatever you want
and you won't get judged.

1357
01:08:46.923 --> 01:08:49.657
At school everyone judges me
and they-

1358
01:08:49.759 --> 01:08:52.594
they put me into categories.

1359
01:08:52.696 --> 01:08:58.199
It's empowering to be
who I want to be.

1360
01:08:58.301 --> 01:09:00.602
You're really good
at crafting arguments.

1361
01:09:00.704 --> 01:09:03.872
I've seen you making cases
on the debate stage,

1362
01:09:03.974 --> 01:09:07.542
I saw you doing it again
on talk shows.

1363
01:09:07.644 --> 01:09:10.278
But you're not on a talk show
right now.

1364
01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:13.348
You're talking to me.

1365
01:09:13.450 --> 01:09:16.384
And I feel like you're trying
to sell me on something.

1366
01:09:16.486 --> 01:09:18.953
I mean, if you feel so empowered

1367
01:09:19.055 --> 01:09:21.956
and if you love what
you're doing so much,

1368
01:09:22.058 --> 01:09:25.894
why do you seem
so unhappy?

1369
01:09:31.902 --> 01:09:33.535
Love you.

1370
01:09:33.637 --> 01:09:35.103
I love you, too.

1371
01:09:35.205 --> 01:09:39.440
Will you please tell Paul
that I love him and I miss him?

1372
01:09:39.543 --> 01:09:41.509
I will.

1373
01:10:01.031 --> 01:10:02.330
Going to the airport?

1374
01:10:02.432 --> 01:10:04.065
Yep.

1375
01:10:04.167 --> 01:10:07.068
Where are you headed?

1376
01:10:07.170 --> 01:10:08.303
Vegas.

1377
01:10:08.405 --> 01:10:09.938
Vegas, baby.

1378
01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:13.374
Man, that's my town.

1379
01:10:13.476 --> 01:10:15.276
What's the occasion?

1380
01:10:15.378 --> 01:10:17.378
Bachelorette party.

1381
01:10:19.716 --> 01:10:20.782
Better be careful.

1382
01:10:20.884 --> 01:10:23.284
People get pretty wild
and crazy in Vegas.

1383
01:10:23.386 --> 01:10:24.052
Hey, wait.

1384
01:10:24.154 --> 01:10:25.320
You're that girl.

1385
01:10:25.422 --> 01:10:27.121
You're that porn girl that went
to Fernwood Prep.

1386
01:10:27.224 --> 01:10:29.857
I got a celebrity in my car.

1387
01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:32.026
Oh, yeah, I guess.

1388
01:10:32.128 --> 01:10:33.661
What's your name again?

1389
01:10:33.763 --> 01:10:35.597
I gotta watch your movies.

1390
01:10:35.699 --> 01:10:39.801
Belle. Belle Knox.

1391
01:10:39.903 --> 01:10:43.137
Why don't you come sit up front
with me, Belle Knox?

1392
01:10:45.141 --> 01:10:54.983
( dance music plays )

1393
01:10:55.085 --> 01:10:57.085
Hi there, sir.

1394
01:10:57.187 --> 01:10:58.920
Belle. You're a
naughty schoolgirl?

1395
01:10:59.022 --> 01:10:59.954
Yes I am.

1396
01:11:00.056 --> 01:11:02.757
I go to Bad Girl University.

1397
01:11:02.859 --> 01:11:03.992
Sign my picture?

1398
01:11:04.094 --> 01:11:05.126
Sure.

1399
01:11:05.228 --> 01:11:07.028
That's $20.

1400
01:11:10.934 --> 01:11:12.166
Can I take my picture
with you?

1401
01:11:12.269 --> 01:11:13.601
Ok.

1402
01:11:13.703 --> 01:11:16.771
How about if I hold onto you
a little bit just like that?

1403
01:11:16.873 --> 01:11:18.640
Yeah.

1404
01:11:18.742 --> 01:11:20.174
Well, can I get a kiss
on the cheek?

1405
01:11:20.277 --> 01:11:21.743
Ok.

1406
01:11:21.845 --> 01:11:23.778
Man. You are so hot!

1407
01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:25.213
What're you doing later?

1408
01:11:25.315 --> 01:11:26.914
Or should I say who?

1409
01:11:27.017 --> 01:11:28.383
I'm a very busy girl.

1410
01:11:28.485 --> 01:11:29.751
I bet you are.

1411
01:11:29.853 --> 01:11:31.753
Hey Belle, tell them about
your new sex toy line

1412
01:11:31.855 --> 01:11:34.022
coming out next month.

1413
01:11:34.124 --> 01:11:39.394
Sometimes I'm a very
naughty girl.

1414
01:11:39.496 --> 01:11:42.263
I bet you need
lots of spankings.

1415
01:11:42.365 --> 01:11:45.533
I do. I can't get enough of 'em.

1416
01:11:45.635 --> 01:11:47.802
I'd like to bend you over
and teach you a lesson

1417
01:11:47.904 --> 01:11:50.138
for being so bad.

1418
01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:51.806
I can help discipline.

1419
01:11:51.908 --> 01:11:54.909
Uncooperative little girls
are my speciality.

1420
01:11:55.011 --> 01:11:57.445
Excuse us.

1421
01:11:58.682 --> 01:12:00.348
How are you doing, sweetie?

1422
01:12:00.450 --> 01:12:01.316
I'm ok.

1423
01:12:01.418 --> 01:12:01.949
Yeah?

1424
01:12:02.052 --> 01:12:03.084
This is intense.

1425
01:12:03.186 --> 01:12:04.786
I know, but just keep your head
in the game.

1426
01:12:04.888 --> 01:12:06.521
Forget about all the gossip.

1427
01:12:06.623 --> 01:12:07.755
What gossip?

1428
01:12:07.857 --> 01:12:09.057
Oh, it's nothing.

1429
01:12:09.159 --> 01:12:11.693
Just some girls are complaining
and calling you a diva.

1430
01:12:11.795 --> 01:12:14.762
It's nothing, really.
Just typical stuff.

1431
01:12:16.032 --> 01:12:17.799
It's gonna be ok.

1432
01:12:17.901 --> 01:12:18.833
Ok?

1433
01:12:26.276 --> 01:12:27.375
Looks like you did quite well.

1434
01:12:27.477 --> 01:12:29.310
Yeah, I guess.

1435
01:12:29.412 --> 01:12:32.013
I still have to pay for hair
and makeup and travel,

1436
01:12:32.115 --> 01:12:34.082
so maybe I made like $500.

1437
01:12:34.184 --> 01:12:36.150
But you didn't have to go
down on anyone.

1438
01:12:36.252 --> 01:12:39.153
Yeah.

1439
01:12:39.255 --> 01:12:43.257
Hey, have you heard that people
have been calling me a diva?

1440
01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:44.525
Don't worry about that.

1441
01:12:44.627 --> 01:12:45.827
Why would anyone say that?

1442
01:12:45.929 --> 01:12:47.328
Belle, you're new. You're hot.

1443
01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:48.429
You booked a lot of jobs.

1444
01:12:48.531 --> 01:12:50.031
The other girls,
they're just jealous.

1445
01:12:50.133 --> 01:12:51.866
But I really want people
to like me.

1446
01:12:51.968 --> 01:12:53.468
They do.

1447
01:12:54.771 --> 01:13:00.108
( shutters snapping )

1448
01:13:00.210 --> 01:13:07.315
( shutters snapping )

1449
01:13:07.417 --> 01:13:08.816
<i> Over here.</i>

1450
01:13:09.919 --> 01:13:11.652
Dora.

1451
01:13:11.755 --> 01:13:13.955
Hey, what's going on?

1452
01:13:14.057 --> 01:13:16.324
Nothing, we're just
heading inside.

1453
01:13:16.426 --> 01:13:17.492
Um, no.

1454
01:13:17.594 --> 01:13:21.362
Something's wrong.

1455
01:13:21.464 --> 01:13:22.864
Why don't your friends
like me?

1456
01:13:22.966 --> 01:13:24.399
Listen, you're really
pissing people off

1457
01:13:24.501 --> 01:13:25.833
with all your press.

1458
01:13:25.935 --> 01:13:29.270
I was just trying to put out
a positive message.

1459
01:13:29.372 --> 01:13:31.272
Talk to you later.

1460
01:13:34.844 --> 01:13:38.346
( shutters snapping )

1461
01:13:38.448 --> 01:13:45.653
( sobbing )

1462
01:13:45.755 --> 01:13:47.088
You ok?

1463
01:13:47.190 --> 01:13:48.956
Yeah, I'm fine.

1464
01:13:49.058 --> 01:13:51.025
I tell you what.

1465
01:13:51.127 --> 01:13:54.829
If you ever feel like you're
becoming your alter-ego,

1466
01:13:54.931 --> 01:13:56.664
that's when you should
be worried.

1467
01:13:56.766 --> 01:14:00.401
You have to keep fantasy
separate from reality.

1468
01:14:00.503 --> 01:14:04.839
That's how you protect yourself.

1469
01:14:04.941 --> 01:14:06.974
They're waiting for you
out there.

1470
01:14:11.614 --> 01:14:13.614
Good luck.

1471
01:14:13.716 --> 01:14:15.483
<i> On behalf of the Risqué</i>
<i> Awards Committee,</i>

1472
01:14:15.585 --> 01:14:18.986
I am especially excited to
present our final category.

1473
01:14:19.088 --> 01:14:21.622
And the winner for Best Newcomer
goes to...

1474
01:14:23.693 --> 01:14:24.725
Belle Knox!

1475
01:14:24.828 --> 01:14:25.760
<i> Alright!</i>

1476
01:14:25.862 --> 01:14:37.972
( applause )

1477
01:14:38.074 --> 01:14:39.407
Thank you.

1478
01:14:39.509 --> 01:14:42.043
Oh my gosh, you guys.

1479
01:14:42.145 --> 01:14:43.211
I just- I want everyone
to know

1480
01:14:43.313 --> 01:14:46.113
how much this award means to me.

1481
01:14:46.216 --> 01:14:49.350
I really love this business,

1482
01:14:49.452 --> 01:14:52.954
so thank you for being like
my new family.

1483
01:14:53.056 --> 01:14:57.558
( applause )

1484
01:15:08.238 --> 01:15:11.839
There goes the spokesperson
for the entire industry.

1485
01:15:11.941 --> 01:15:14.475
Belle Knox.

1486
01:15:15.578 --> 01:15:17.645
Dora.

1487
01:15:17.747 --> 01:15:19.847
Hey, can I hang with you?

1488
01:15:19.949 --> 01:15:20.982
No.

1489
01:15:21.084 --> 01:15:22.950
Go find someone else
to cling onto.

1490
01:15:23.052 --> 01:15:24.318
Why are you being like this?

1491
01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:25.953
You really don't get it,
do you?

1492
01:15:26.055 --> 01:15:27.755
Nobody asked you to go on
every show and blog

1493
01:15:27.857 --> 01:15:29.056
and speak for us.

1494
01:15:29.158 --> 01:15:30.725
You've been in this industry
for five minutes

1495
01:15:30.827 --> 01:15:33.127
and you don't know
what you're talking about.

1496
01:15:33.229 --> 01:15:34.695
But you love that spotlight

1497
01:15:34.797 --> 01:15:37.231
and I guess that's the most
important thing, huh?

1498
01:15:37.333 --> 01:15:39.367
No, I- I was trying to help.

1499
01:15:39.469 --> 01:15:41.135
Yeah, trying to help yourself.

1500
01:15:41.237 --> 01:15:44.705
None of us need or want
your help, ok?

1501
01:15:44.807 --> 01:15:45.973
I thought we were friends.

1502
01:15:46.075 --> 01:15:47.074
We hung out a couple
of times

1503
01:15:47.176 --> 01:15:49.176
but we hardly know each other.

1504
01:15:49.279 --> 01:15:51.412
Wow, are you really
that naive?

1505
01:16:09.632 --> 01:16:11.966
Hey, baby.

1506
01:16:12.068 --> 01:16:13.067
Don?

1507
01:16:13.169 --> 01:16:15.069
It's just- just me.

1508
01:16:18.408 --> 01:16:19.173
What are you doing in my room?

1509
01:16:19.275 --> 01:16:20.207
Get out!

1510
01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:21.375
( slurring ) Don't
worry about it.

1511
01:16:21.477 --> 01:16:24.278
I just- I told front desk
we were friends.

1512
01:16:24.380 --> 01:16:26.647
And maybe greased
the wheels a little bit.

1513
01:16:26.749 --> 01:16:28.549
Get out of my room!

1514
01:16:28.651 --> 01:16:30.484
Relax.

1515
01:16:30.587 --> 01:16:32.086
I got money.

1516
01:16:32.188 --> 01:16:32.820
How much do you need?

1517
01:16:32.922 --> 01:16:33.688
Get out of my room!

1518
01:16:33.790 --> 01:16:34.655
I don't want your money!

1519
01:16:34.757 --> 01:16:36.357
Get out! Get out!

1520
01:16:36.459 --> 01:16:38.159
Get out of my room!

1521
01:16:38.261 --> 01:16:39.760
Go!

1522
01:16:39.862 --> 01:16:41.696
Ok, you're right.

1523
01:16:50.817 --> 01:16:53.117
Are you checking out, too?

1524
01:16:53.219 --> 01:16:54.252
Can you believe
they're having

1525
01:16:54.354 --> 01:16:56.387
some sort of smut
convention here?

1526
01:16:56.489 --> 01:16:58.890
I mean, I was told
this is a good hotel

1527
01:16:58.992 --> 01:17:00.925
to bring my family to.

1528
01:17:03.563 --> 01:17:05.062
I'm gonna give them a piece
of my mind.

1529
01:17:05.165 --> 01:17:07.198
These people are disgusting.

1530
01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:09.000
We can't stay here.

1531
01:17:09.102 --> 01:17:12.170
Yeah, it's crazy.

1532
01:17:12.272 --> 01:17:15.139
You go to Duke?

1533
01:17:15.241 --> 01:17:17.809
That is an excellent school.

1534
01:17:17.911 --> 01:17:20.378
Your parents must be proud.

1535
01:17:45.471 --> 01:17:54.045
( sobbing )

1536
01:18:14.801 --> 01:18:16.200
( knocking )

1537
01:18:16.302 --> 01:18:18.002
<i> Be right there.</i>

1538
01:18:22.108 --> 01:18:23.875
Hey.

1539
01:18:23.977 --> 01:18:26.510
What's going on?

1540
01:18:26.613 --> 01:18:28.012
Can I come in?

1541
01:18:28.114 --> 01:18:30.014
Yeah, sure.

1542
01:18:37.290 --> 01:18:40.725
Where are you coming from?

1543
01:18:40.827 --> 01:18:42.727
An adult industry convention.

1544
01:18:42.829 --> 01:18:44.495
I don't want to talk about it.

1545
01:18:49.335 --> 01:18:54.805
I just want to make sure
we're ok.

1546
01:18:54.908 --> 01:18:57.708
Yeah. We're ok.

1547
01:19:00.246 --> 01:19:01.846
It's just...

1548
01:19:01.948 --> 01:19:05.383
you have this whole other world
that you're a part of

1549
01:19:05.485 --> 01:19:09.153
and it's not easy to relate
to sometimes.

1550
01:19:09.255 --> 01:19:12.723
I know.

1551
01:19:12.825 --> 01:19:14.792
I just...

1552
01:19:14.894 --> 01:19:20.331
I thought I had found
this whole other family

1553
01:19:20.433 --> 01:19:25.603
and this place
where I sort of belonged.

1554
01:19:25.705 --> 01:19:29.907
But it really wasn't
like that at all.

1555
01:19:30.009 --> 01:19:34.211
And you have been so awesome

1556
01:19:34.314 --> 01:19:41.152
and so supportive and I am
so grateful for that.

1557
01:19:41.254 --> 01:19:43.321
You're wearing my necklace.

1558
01:19:43.423 --> 01:19:46.190
That's what friends do.

1559
01:19:46.292 --> 01:19:49.627
What you're trying to do,
it's a lot.

1560
01:19:49.729 --> 01:19:51.629
It's a lot to take on.

1561
01:19:51.731 --> 01:19:56.500
It'd be a lot for anyone.

1562
01:19:56.602 --> 01:20:00.972
This all started because I just
wanted to pay for school

1563
01:20:01.074 --> 01:20:04.942
and now everything has gotten
so out of control.

1564
01:20:05.044 --> 01:20:11.916
It's like I blinked and
my entire life changed.

1565
01:20:15.121 --> 01:20:16.988
You made a choice.

1566
01:20:17.090 --> 01:20:19.357
And you owned up to it.

1567
01:20:19.459 --> 01:20:23.327
So who cares if other people
judge you?

1568
01:20:23.429 --> 01:20:26.998
The last few months
have been crazy,

1569
01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:29.700
but you're only eighteen.

1570
01:20:29.802 --> 01:20:31.702
You're not supposed
to know everything.

1571
01:20:31.804 --> 01:20:34.905
You've got your whole life
ahead of you.

1572
01:20:35.008 --> 01:20:38.776
Thank you, Jolie.

1573
01:20:38.878 --> 01:20:44.448
I'm just not really sure
what I'm supposed to do next.

1574
01:20:44.550 --> 01:20:46.617
Anything you want.

1575
01:20:46.719 --> 01:20:49.387
Having sex on camera is not
the only thing you're good at,

1576
01:20:49.489 --> 01:20:50.654
that's for dang sure.

1577
01:20:50.757 --> 01:20:51.956
( laughs )

1578
01:20:52.058 --> 01:20:53.858
Thanks.

1579
01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:55.659
Any time.

1580
01:21:06.439 --> 01:21:09.140
I grew up in a very
conservative family.

1581
01:21:09.242 --> 01:21:11.542
And while I remain conservative
economically,

1582
01:21:11.644 --> 01:21:14.045
I feel much more
socially liberal

1583
01:21:14.147 --> 01:21:17.181
and in line with libertarian
ideals and themes

1584
01:21:17.283 --> 01:21:20.885
such as free speech, choice,
and autonomy

1585
01:21:20.987 --> 01:21:25.122
when it comes to what you
do with your own body.

1586
01:21:25.224 --> 01:21:29.360
Whether I choose to be a
sex worker or a social worker,

1587
01:21:29.462 --> 01:21:33.597
I don't need the government
telling me how and what to do

1588
01:21:33.699 --> 01:21:36.767
and interfering with
my personal liberty.

1589
01:21:36.869 --> 01:21:39.070
( cheering )

1590
01:21:39.172 --> 01:21:46.911
( applause )

1591
01:21:47.013 --> 01:21:50.748
Hey, Miriam. Can we talk?

1592
01:21:50.850 --> 01:21:52.750
<i> We'll just be over here.</i>

1593
01:21:55.721 --> 01:21:58.789
Last time we did that
things didn't go too well.

1594
01:21:58.891 --> 01:21:59.990
I tried to be fair.

1595
01:22:00.093 --> 01:22:02.526
I was much kinder than
those talk show hosts.

1596
01:22:02.628 --> 01:22:03.928
That's true.

1597
01:22:04.030 --> 01:22:05.529
I know you tried to be fair.

1598
01:22:05.631 --> 01:22:07.131
But I'm trying to keep
a low profile, so...

1599
01:22:07.233 --> 01:22:11.535
Just out of curiosity,
are you still doing porn?

1600
01:22:11.637 --> 01:22:14.338
I mean, off the record.

1601
01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:17.274
Let's just say I'm re-focusing
some of my energy

1602
01:22:17.376 --> 01:22:18.709
on the bigger picture.

1603
01:22:18.811 --> 01:22:20.377
What is the bigger picture?

1604
01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:22.880
I mean, what's next?

1605
01:22:22.982 --> 01:22:24.849
Politics.

1606
01:22:24.951 --> 01:22:26.050
Really?

1607
01:22:26.152 --> 01:22:27.952
Like you want to run
for office?

1608
01:22:28.054 --> 01:22:28.986
One day.

1609
01:22:29.088 --> 01:22:30.354
How will you do that?

1610
01:22:30.456 --> 01:22:33.290
I mean, your videos
will always be online.

1611
01:22:33.392 --> 01:22:35.559
Our generation is changing
the world.

1612
01:22:35.661 --> 01:22:38.262
And so is the stigma associated
with a lot of lifestyles

1613
01:22:38.364 --> 01:22:41.465
that have generally been
on the fringes.

1614
01:22:41.567 --> 01:22:43.234
I believe that because I believe
in our country

1615
01:22:43.336 --> 01:22:45.469
and I believe that people
are good.

1616
01:22:45.571 --> 01:22:47.271
Don't you?

1617
01:22:47.373 --> 01:22:49.240
I'm not sure.

1618
01:22:49.342 --> 01:22:52.443
I'd like to.

1619
01:22:52.545 --> 01:22:54.345
I admire how you've
handled everything.

1620
01:22:54.447 --> 01:22:56.280
I don't know what
I would have done.

1621
01:22:56.382 --> 01:22:59.917
Well, you probably wouldn't have
done porn in the first place.

1622
01:23:00.019 --> 01:23:01.585
( laughs )

1623
01:23:01.687 --> 01:23:04.488
Yeah, probably not.

1624
01:23:04.590 --> 01:23:05.856
You're a tough chick, though.

1625
01:23:05.958 --> 01:23:07.725
I'm glad you're looking
to the future.

1626
01:23:07.827 --> 01:23:10.060
We can only move forward.

1627
01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:16.033
Take care of yourself.

1628
01:23:16.235 --> 01:23:18.002
You too.

1629
01:23:23.409 --> 01:23:25.109
<i> Hey, Miriam?</i>

1630
01:23:25.211 --> 01:23:26.644
I have to go.

1631
01:23:26.746 --> 01:23:28.412
It was really nice
to see you.

1632
01:23:28.514 --> 01:23:30.181
It was nice to see you, too.

1633
01:23:31.951 --> 01:23:32.950
Oh, Miriam.

1634
01:23:39.025 --> 01:23:40.024
( shutter snaps )

1635
01:23:41.305 --> 01:23:47.491
