1
00:01:43.812 --> 00:01:47.691
<i>I shall tell you of William Wallace.</i>

2
00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:51.194
<i>Historians from England
will say I am a liar,</i>

3
00:01:51.278 --> 00:01:55.365
<i>but history is written by those
who have hanged heroes.</i>

4
00:01:56.867 --> 00:01:59.995
<i>The king of Scotland
had died without a son,</i>

5
00:02:00.037 --> 00:02:01.705
<i>and the king of England,</i>

6
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.375
<i>a cruel pagan known
as Edward the Longshanks,</i>

7
00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:08.545
<i>claimed the throne of Scotland
for himself</i>

8
00:02:09.421 --> 00:02:11.548
<i>Scotland's nobles fought him</i>

9
00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:15.010
<i>and fought each other over the crown.</i>

10
00:02:15.886 --> 00:02:19.181
<i>So Longshanks invited them
to talks of truce,</i>

11
00:02:19.598 --> 00:02:22.434
<i>no weapons, one page only.</i>

12
00:02:27.022 --> 00:02:29.608
<i>Among the farmers of that shire
was Malcolm Wallace,</i>

13
00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:31.526
<i>a commoner with his own lands.</i>

14
00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:34.237
<i>He had two sons, John and William.</i>

15
00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:43.497
I told you to stay.

16
00:02:44.915 --> 00:02:47.084
Well, I finished my work.

17
00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:48.251
Where are we going?

18
00:02:48.293 --> 00:02:51.505
MacAndrews'. He was supposed to visit
when the gathering was over.

19
00:02:51.588 --> 00:02:53.757
-Can I come?
-No. Go home, boy.

20
00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:55.175
But I want to go.

21
00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:57.928
Go home, William,
or you'll feel the back of my hand.

22
00:02:58.011 --> 00:03:00.180
Go you home, William.

23
00:03:24.287 --> 00:03:25.789
MacAndrews!

24
00:03:30.752 --> 00:03:32.295
MacAndrews!

25
00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:42.097
Holy Jesus.

26
00:04:26.224 --> 00:04:29.060
-It's all right!
-William ! William!

27
00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:33.190
William ! William, it's all right.

28
00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:35.692
It's all right. Easy, lad.

29
00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:53.210
William.

30
00:04:55.378 --> 00:04:58.215
And I say we hit back now!

31
00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:01.092
-We cannot fight them ! It's suicide!
-Something's got to be done.

32
00:05:01.176 --> 00:05:03.887
Wallace is right! We fight them!

33
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.723
Every nobleman who had a will to fight
was at that meeting.

34
00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:08.016
We cannot beat an army.

35
00:05:08.058 --> 00:05:09.810
Not with 50 farmers.

36
00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:13.104
We do not have to beat them,
just fight them.

37
00:05:13.897 --> 00:05:15.690
Now, who's with me?

38
00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:17.692
I am, Wallace.

39
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.653
All right, all right.

40
00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:20.904
Ready.

41
00:05:35.794 --> 00:05:37.170
Where do you think you're going?

42
00:05:37.254 --> 00:05:38.630
I'm going with you.

43
00:05:38.713 --> 00:05:40.924
You're going with me, are you?

44
00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:44.344
-And what are you going to do?
-I'm gonna help.

45
00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:46.680
And a good help you'd be, too,

46
00:05:47.472 --> 00:05:51.601
but I need you to stay here
and look after the place for me

47
00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:53.103
while I'm away.

48
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.773
I can fight.

49
00:05:59.609 --> 00:06:02.737
I know. I know you can fight.

50
00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:10.787
But it's our wits that make us men.

51
00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:17.294
See you tomorrow.

52
00:06:48.325 --> 00:06:50.076
-English.
-Get down.

53
00:06:51.328 --> 00:06:55.248
With your father and brother gone,
they'll kill us and burn the farm.

54
00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:57.751
It's up to us, Hamish.

55
00:07:16.061 --> 00:07:17.228
Nah.

56
00:08:02.983 --> 00:08:04.484
Da?

57
00:08:10.949 --> 00:08:11.992
Da?

58
00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:26.274
William.

59
00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:31.404
Come here, lad.

60
00:11:01.619 --> 00:11:02.912
Amen.

61
00:11:03.413 --> 00:11:04.706
-Amen.
-Amen.

62
00:12:58.152 --> 00:12:59.445
William.

63
00:13:01.364 --> 00:13:03.908
I'm your uncle. Argyle.

64
00:13:17.046 --> 00:13:19.507
You have the look of your mother.

65
00:13:30.852 --> 00:13:32.562
We'll stay here tonight.

66
00:13:32.603 --> 00:13:34.981
Tomorrow you'll come home with me.

67
00:13:35.064 --> 00:13:36.941
I don't want to leave.

68
00:13:37.984 --> 00:13:41.321
You didn't want your father to die either,
did you?

69
00:13:41.404 --> 00:13:43.031
But it happened.

70
00:13:46.784 --> 00:13:49.579
Did the priest give a poetic benediction?

71
00:13:50.413 --> 00:13:51.914
"The Lord bless thee and keep thee"?

72
00:13:51.956 --> 00:13:53.833
It was in Latin.

73
00:13:53.916 --> 00:13:55.501
You don't speak Latin?

74
00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:00.673
Well, that's something
we shall have to remedy, isn't it?

75
00:14:03.968 --> 00:14:06.763
The Lord bless thee and keep thee.

76
00:14:08.139 --> 00:14:11.517
The Lord cause his light
to shine on thee.

77
00:14:11.601 --> 00:14:14.771
The Lord lift up
his countenance upon thee

78
00:14:14.854 --> 00:14:16.939
and give thee peace.

79
00:14:17.648 --> 00:14:19.317
Amen.

80
00:14:25.656 --> 00:14:27.450
Your heart is free.

81
00:14:29.243 --> 00:14:31.496
Have the courage to follow it.

82
00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:00.983
What are they doing?

83
00:15:01.025 --> 00:15:04.278
Saying goodbye in their own way.

84
00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.824
Playing outlawed tunes
on outlawed pipes.

85
00:15:18.126 --> 00:15:22.171
It was the same for me and your daddy
when our father was killed.

86
00:15:49.699 --> 00:15:54.245
First, learn to use this.

87
00:15:55.705 --> 00:16:00.168
Then I'll teach you to use this.

88
00:16:30.656 --> 00:16:32.116
<i>Many years later,</i>

89
00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.161
<i>Edward the Longshanks,
King of England,</i>

90
00:16:35.244 --> 00:16:37.997
<i>supervised the wedding
of his eldest son,</i>

91
00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.666
<i>who would succeed him to the throne.</i>

92
00:16:43.377 --> 00:16:44.712
Amen.

93
00:16:49.175 --> 00:16:51.052
<i>As bride for his son,</i>

94
00:16:51.093 --> 00:16:54.514
<i>Longshanks had chosen the daughter
of his rival,</i>

95
00:16:54.597 --> 00:16:56.390
<i>the King of France.</i>

96
00:17:20.122 --> 00:17:23.709
<i>It was widely whispered
that for the princess to conceive,</i>

97
00:17:23.793 --> 00:17:26.879
<i>Longshanks would have to do
the honors himself</i>

98
00:17:27.672 --> 00:17:30.883
<i>That may have been
what he had in mind all along.</i>

99
00:17:34.929 --> 00:17:38.933
Scotland. My land.

100
00:17:41.352 --> 00:17:45.565
The French will grovel
to anyone with strength,

101
00:17:46.315 --> 00:17:48.651
but how will they believe our strength

102
00:17:48.734 --> 00:17:51.862
when we cannot rule
the whole of our own island?

103
00:18:02.665 --> 00:18:04.333
Where is my son?

104
00:18:04.417 --> 00:18:08.004
Your pardon, milord.
He asked me to come in his stead.

105
00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:10.840
I sent for him, and he sends you.

106
00:18:11.757 --> 00:18:13.676
Shall I leave, milord?

107
00:18:15.052 --> 00:18:18.472
If he wants his queen
to rule when I am gone,

108
00:18:18.514 --> 00:18:21.601
then, by all means, stay and learn how.

109
00:18:21.892 --> 00:18:23.185
Please.

110
00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.691
Nobles.

111
00:18:29.358 --> 00:18:32.695
Nobles are the key
to the door of Scotland.

112
00:18:33.321 --> 00:18:36.490
Grant our nobles lands in the north,

113
00:18:36.532 --> 00:18:40.411
give their nobles
estates here in England,

114
00:18:40.494 --> 00:18:42.830
and make them too greedy
to oppose us.

115
00:18:42.872 --> 00:18:46.000
But, sire,
our nobles will be reluctant to uproot.

116
00:18:46.042 --> 00:18:48.419
New lands mean new taxes,

117
00:18:48.502 --> 00:18:50.546
and they're already taxed
for the war in France.

118
00:18:50.588 --> 00:18:51.922
Are they?

119
00:18:53.424 --> 00:18:54.759
Are they?

120
00:19:13.569 --> 00:19:17.948
The trouble with Scotland
is that it's full of Scots.

121
00:19:22.495 --> 00:19:27.249
Perhaps the time has come
to reinstitute an old custom.

122
00:19:28.084 --> 00:19:30.961
Grant them <i>prima nocte.</i>

123
00:19:33.589 --> 00:19:35.007
First night.

124
00:19:35.341 --> 00:19:38.928
When any common girl inhabiting
their lands is married,

125
00:19:39.011 --> 00:19:45.351
our nobles shall have sexual rights
to her on the night of her wedding.

126
00:19:47.103 --> 00:19:51.982
If we can't get them out,
we'll breed them out.

127
00:19:53.109 --> 00:19:57.446
That should fetch just the kind of lords
we want to Scotland,

128
00:19:57.488 --> 00:19:59.281
taxes or no taxes.

129
00:19:59.782 --> 00:20:03.369
-A most excellent idea, sire.
-Is it?

130
00:20:08.416 --> 00:20:12.586
<i>Now in Edinburgh were gathered
the council of Scottish nobles.</i>

131
00:20:13.129 --> 00:20:17.091
<i>Among these was Robert,
the 17th Earl of Bruce,</i>

132
00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.970
<i>a leading contender for the crown
of Scotland.</i>

133
00:20:27.143 --> 00:20:30.604
I hear that Longshanks
has granted <i>prima nocte.</i>

134
00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.775
Clearly meant to draw more
of his supporters here.

135
00:20:35.484 --> 00:20:40.114
My father believes that we must
lull Longshanks into our confidence

136
00:20:40.156 --> 00:20:42.158
by neither supporting his decree
nor opposing it.

137
00:20:42.241 --> 00:20:43.826
A wise plan.

138
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:46.120
And how is your father?
We missed him at the council.

139
00:20:46.162 --> 00:20:49.039
His affairs in France
keep him long overdue.

140
00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:56.422
But he sends his greetings,

141
00:20:56.505 --> 00:21:00.468
and he says that I speak
for all of the Bruces and for Scotland.

142
00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:13.559
It's all over now.

143
00:23:13.642 --> 00:23:15.561
You've dropped your rock.

144
00:23:15.644 --> 00:23:17.104
Test of manhood.

145
00:23:19.148 --> 00:23:20.441
You win.

146
00:23:22.401 --> 00:23:24.778
Call it a test of soldiery, then.

147
00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:27.281
The English won't let us train
with weapons,

148
00:23:27.323 --> 00:23:28.741
so we train with stones.

149
00:23:28.824 --> 00:23:32.661
The test of a soldier is not in his arm.
It's here.

150
00:23:32.745 --> 00:23:34.747
No. It's here.

151
00:23:41.712 --> 00:23:42.963
Hamish?

152
00:23:57.019 --> 00:23:58.062
Here you go, Son.

153
00:23:58.145 --> 00:23:59.188
Show him how.

154
00:23:59.229 --> 00:24:00.564
Come on, Hamish!

155
00:24:02.358 --> 00:24:04.026
You'll never beat Hamish.

156
00:24:04.109 --> 00:24:06.153
Come on there, boy!

157
00:24:17.414 --> 00:24:18.457
My boy!

158
00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:20.709
That's a good throw.

159
00:24:20.751 --> 00:24:22.419
Aye. Aye, it was.

160
00:24:23.212 --> 00:24:26.674
I was wondering if you could do that
when it matters.

161
00:24:29.259 --> 00:24:31.303
As it matters in battle.

162
00:24:33.389 --> 00:24:35.849
Could you crush a man with that throw?

163
00:24:35.891 --> 00:24:38.435
I could crush you like a worm.

164
00:24:41.146 --> 00:24:43.023
-You could?
-Aye.

165
00:24:43.899 --> 00:24:44.984
Well, then, do it.

166
00:24:45.067 --> 00:24:46.860
Would you like to see him crush me
like a worm?

167
00:24:46.902 --> 00:24:47.903
Aye.

168
00:24:51.907 --> 00:24:53.659
-Come do it.
-You'll move.

169
00:24:53.742 --> 00:24:55.119
I will not.

170
00:24:55.869 --> 00:24:57.204
Right.

171
00:24:57.246 --> 00:24:58.330
He'll move.

172
00:24:58.414 --> 00:25:00.416
Come on, Hamish.

173
00:25:01.667 --> 00:25:03.460
Come on there, boy!

174
00:25:11.885 --> 00:25:13.262
Well done!

175
00:25:27.234 --> 00:25:29.278
Fine display, young Wallace.

176
00:25:29.361 --> 00:25:30.946
Are you all right?

177
00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:33.073
You look a wee bit shaky.

178
00:25:33.991 --> 00:25:37.244
-I should have remembered the rocks.
-Aye, you should have.

179
00:25:42.624 --> 00:25:44.918
Get up, you big heap.

180
00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:46.420
It's good to see you again.

181
00:25:46.462 --> 00:25:48.213
Aye. Welcome home.

182
00:25:50.466 --> 00:25:52.843
-Got my head.
-Well, you should have moved.

183
00:26:04.271 --> 00:26:06.732
William, will you dance with me?

184
00:26:08.108 --> 00:26:09.777
Of course I will.

185
00:26:34.968 --> 00:26:37.930
I've come to claim the right
of <i>prima nocte.</i>

186
00:26:38.764 --> 00:26:42.184
As lord of these lands,
I will bless this marriage

187
00:26:42.226 --> 00:26:47.272
by taking the bride into my bed
on the first night of her union.

188
00:26:47.356 --> 00:26:49.191
By God, you will not!

189
00:26:52.903 --> 00:26:55.030
It is my noble right.

190
00:28:56.818 --> 00:28:58.070
Good evening, sir.

191
00:28:58.153 --> 00:28:59.696
Young Wallace.

192
00:29:00.614 --> 00:29:04.034
-Grand soft evening, huh?
-Aye, it's that.

193
00:29:04.117 --> 00:29:07.788
I was wondering if I might have a word
with your daughter.

194
00:29:08.538 --> 00:29:10.832
What do you want
to have a word with her about?

195
00:29:10.916 --> 00:29:11.917
Well...

196
00:29:12.542 --> 00:29:16.672
Murron, would you like to come
and ride with me on this fine evening?

197
00:29:18.548 --> 00:29:21.176
In this? You're out of your mind.

198
00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:24.471
It's good Scottish weather, madam.
The rain is falling straight down.

199
00:29:24.513 --> 00:29:26.014
Slightly to the side, like.

200
00:29:26.098 --> 00:29:28.809
-She can't go with you.
-No?

201
00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:31.186
No the now, anyway.

202
00:29:31.228 --> 00:29:33.230
-No the now.
-No the now?

203
00:29:33.313 --> 00:29:34.398
We'll see you later.

204
00:29:34.481 --> 00:29:36.525
The weather's just fine.
It's hardly raining.

205
00:29:36.608 --> 00:29:38.986
Did you not hear what I said?

206
00:29:39.027 --> 00:29:41.780
-Murron !
-Murron ! Get...

207
00:29:44.324 --> 00:29:45.701
It's you she takes after.

208
00:30:15.939 --> 00:30:17.983
How did you know me after so long?

209
00:30:18.066 --> 00:30:19.526
I didn't.

210
00:30:19.693 --> 00:30:22.946
It's just... I saw you staring at me,
and I didn't know who you were.

211
00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:25.157
I'm sorry. I suppose I was.

212
00:30:27.909 --> 00:30:30.912
Are you in the habit of riding off
in the rain with strangers?

213
00:30:30.996 --> 00:30:34.333
It was the best way to make you leave.

214
00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:39.254
If I can ever work up the courage
to ask you again,

215
00:30:39.296 --> 00:30:40.756
I'll send you a written warning first.

216
00:30:40.797 --> 00:30:42.799
That wouldn't do you much good.
I can't read.

217
00:30:42.883 --> 00:30:44.926
-Can you not?
-No.

218
00:30:47.763 --> 00:30:50.390
Well, that's something
we shall have to remedy, isn't it?

219
00:30:50.432 --> 00:30:53.226
-You're going to teach me to read, then?
-If you like.

220
00:30:53.393 --> 00:30:56.104
-Aye.
-In what language?

221
00:30:57.856 --> 00:30:59.274
You're showing off now.

222
00:30:59.358 --> 00:31:02.361
-That's right. Are you impressed yet?
-No. Why? Should I be?

1261
00:31:02.611 --> 00:31:04.196
Yes.

1262
00:31:04.279 --> 00:31:08.617
Because every day I thought about you.

223
00:31:10.911 --> 00:31:14.206
Do that standing on your head,
and I'll be impressed.

224
00:31:14.539 --> 00:31:16.583
My kilt will fly up, but I'll try it.

225
00:31:16.625 --> 00:31:18.960
God, you certainly didn't learn
any manners on your travels.

226
00:31:19.002 --> 00:31:21.797
The French and the Romans
have far worse manners than I.

227
00:31:21.838 --> 00:31:25.050
-You've been to Rome?
-Aye, Argyle took me on a pilgrimage.

228
00:31:25.133 --> 00:31:26.802
What was it like?

1263
00:31:27.052 --> 00:31:29.972
Not nearly as beautiful as you.

229
00:31:31.973 --> 00:31:34.142
What does that mean?

230
00:31:34.184 --> 00:31:35.560
Beautiful.

231
00:31:38.855 --> 00:31:40.565
But I belong here.

232
00:32:13.682 --> 00:32:15.684
Murron? Come in now.

233
00:33:27.047 --> 00:33:30.300
Sir, I know it was strange of me
to invite Murron to ride last night,

234
00:33:30.383 --> 00:33:31.384
but I assure you...

235
00:33:31.426 --> 00:33:34.262
MacClannough's daughter
is another matter.

236
00:33:34.304 --> 00:33:37.015
I've come to fetch you to our meeting.

237
00:33:37.766 --> 00:33:40.101
-What kind of meeting?
-The secret kind.

238
00:33:40.185 --> 00:33:43.104
Your meetings are a waste of time,
Campbell.

239
00:33:44.773 --> 00:33:48.235
Your father was a fighter and a patriot.

240
00:33:51.112 --> 00:33:53.156
I know who my father was.

241
00:33:54.449 --> 00:33:58.245
I came back home to raise crops
and, God willing, a family.

242
00:33:59.955 --> 00:34:02.666
-If I can live in peace, I will.
-Go on.

243
00:34:02.749 --> 00:34:04.709
You say you want to stay out
of the troubles?

244
00:34:04.918 --> 00:34:05.919
Aye.

245
00:34:05.961 --> 00:34:08.588
If you can prove it,
you may court my daughter.

246
00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:11.132
Until you prove it, my answer's no.

247
00:34:11.174 --> 00:34:12.384
No?

248
00:34:12.467 --> 00:34:14.094
No, Wallace. No.

249
00:34:14.511 --> 00:34:16.846
-Didn't I just prove it?
-No!

250
00:34:16.930 --> 00:34:18.765
-No?
-No!

251
00:35:00.807 --> 00:35:03.935
Of course,
running a farm's a lot of work,

252
00:35:04.019 --> 00:35:06.980
but that will all change
when my sons arrive.

253
00:35:08.106 --> 00:35:10.066
So you've got children?

254
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:13.862
Not yet, but I was hoping
that you could help me with that.

255
00:35:14.738 --> 00:35:16.531
So you want me to marry you, then?

256
00:35:16.573 --> 00:35:18.950
It's a bit sudden, but all right.

257
00:35:19.034 --> 00:35:21.453
Is that what you call a proposal?

258
00:35:22.537 --> 00:35:25.332
I love you. Always have.

259
00:35:27.667 --> 00:35:29.419
I want to marry you.

260
00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.058
Is that a yes?

261
00:35:43.141 --> 00:35:45.310
-Aye, that's a yes.
-It is?

262
00:36:28.311 --> 00:36:30.397
We best hurry. He'll be waiting.

263
00:36:30.438 --> 00:36:32.607
-Wait.
-Where are you going?

264
00:36:38.947 --> 00:36:41.032
-What's that?
-You'll see.

265
00:36:59.968 --> 00:37:01.428
Father.

266
00:37:14.149 --> 00:37:16.484
I will love you my whole life,

267
00:37:17.736 --> 00:37:19.446
you and no other.

268
00:37:24.826 --> 00:37:26.202
And I you,

269
00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:29.164
you and no other, forever.

270
00:40:57.872 --> 00:40:59.457
When am I going to see you again?

271
00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:01.000
Tonight?

272
00:41:01.042 --> 00:41:03.127
-I can't.
-Why not?

273
00:41:03.211 --> 00:41:04.337
My dad's growing suspicious.

274
00:41:04.379 --> 00:41:05.546
Growing suspicious, is he?

275
00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:07.382
Wouldn't have anything to do with that,
would it?

276
00:41:07.465 --> 00:41:09.217
When? When? When?

277
00:41:10.885 --> 00:41:12.762
-When?
-Tonight.

278
00:41:12.845 --> 00:41:15.056
-Tonight.
-Tonight.

279
00:41:22.146 --> 00:41:24.107
Look lively, Sergeant.

280
00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:37.161
Where are you going, lassie?

281
00:41:37.245 --> 00:41:38.371
That looks heavy.

282
00:41:38.413 --> 00:41:40.748
-Let me help you with it.
-No. It's fine.

283
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:43.251
I'm not going to steal it.

284
00:41:45.586 --> 00:41:48.548
You remind me
of my daughter back home.

285
00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:02.645
Hello, lassie.

286
00:42:17.452 --> 00:42:19.370
No! No!

287
00:42:22.206 --> 00:42:24.625
Keep it quiet, Smythe.

288
00:42:28.046 --> 00:42:29.756
You bitch!

289
00:42:37.013 --> 00:42:38.598
You bitch!

290
00:42:47.148 --> 00:42:48.316
Are you all right?

291
00:42:48.357 --> 00:42:50.276
All right? Come on.

292
00:42:52.737 --> 00:42:53.946
-Are you all right?
-Aye.

293
00:42:53.988 --> 00:42:55.698
Are you all right?

294
00:43:04.832 --> 00:43:06.626
-Can you ride?
-Aye.

295
00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:14.133
Come back here, you bastard!

296
00:43:14.926 --> 00:43:16.344
Raise the alarm!

297
00:43:16.427 --> 00:43:17.845
Help!

298
00:43:18.429 --> 00:43:20.598
Meet me at the grove. Ride!

299
00:43:21.015 --> 00:43:22.975
They're getting away!

300
00:43:28.815 --> 00:43:30.817
Go round back!

301
00:43:47.375 --> 00:43:48.709
Get her!

302
00:43:49.544 --> 00:43:51.921
Come on!

303
00:44:06.644 --> 00:44:07.645
You bitch!

304
00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:32.211
Murron?

305
00:44:39.552 --> 00:44:41.053
Murron!

306
00:44:49.604 --> 00:44:52.148
All of you know full well

307
00:44:52.231 --> 00:44:54.650
the great pains I've always taken

308
00:44:55.443 --> 00:45:00.072
never to be too strict, too rigid
with the application of our laws.

309
00:45:00.948 --> 00:45:02.950
And as a consequence,

310
00:45:03.034 --> 00:45:06.245
have we not learned to live together

311
00:45:06.287 --> 00:45:08.581
in relative peace and harmony?

312
00:45:14.462 --> 00:45:20.051
And this day's lawlessness
is how you repay my leniency!

313
00:45:29.393 --> 00:45:31.812
Well, you leave me with little choice.

314
00:45:39.654 --> 00:45:42.156
An assault on the king's soldiers

315
00:45:43.491 --> 00:45:46.535
is the same as an assault
on the king himself.

316
00:46:02.843 --> 00:46:04.804
Now,

317
00:46:04.845 --> 00:46:07.515
let this scrapper come to me.

318
00:46:53.894 --> 00:46:54.979
Sir!

319
00:47:03.487 --> 00:47:04.739
There.

320
00:50:31.403 --> 00:50:32.613
Corporal.

321
00:50:32.696 --> 00:50:35.074
Some archers on the tower. Now!

322
00:50:44.833 --> 00:50:46.627
Hold still, Father.

323
00:50:47.753 --> 00:50:49.338
You're an idiot, boy!

324
00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:15.215
Father, you all right?

325
00:53:38.340 --> 00:53:39.758
MacAulish.

326
00:53:42.136 --> 00:53:43.679
MacAulish.

327
00:53:45.931 --> 00:53:47.307
MacAulish!

328
00:53:48.434 --> 00:53:51.478
MacAulish ! MacAulish!

329
00:53:52.146 --> 00:53:56.150
-MacAulish ! MacAulish !
-Wallace! Wallace!

330
00:53:56.233 --> 00:53:58.402
Wallace! Wallace!

331
00:53:58.485 --> 00:54:01.780
Wallace! Wallace! Wallace!

332
00:54:01.822 --> 00:54:05.033
Wallace! Wallace! Wallace!

333
00:56:20.627 --> 00:56:22.671
What you waiting for, boy?

334
00:56:23.964 --> 00:56:26.758
Here. You can do it. I'll hold him down.

335
00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:30.596
Here. You can do it.

336
00:56:31.305 --> 00:56:32.723
I'll hold him down.

337
00:56:32.806 --> 00:56:34.474
Pour it straight in the wound, boy.

338
00:56:34.558 --> 00:56:36.643
I know it seems like a waste
of good whiskey.

339
00:56:36.727 --> 00:56:38.145
Indulge me.

340
00:56:41.815 --> 00:56:43.191
Hold him. Hold him.

341
00:56:43.275 --> 00:56:46.153
Hold him. Now let him go.

342
00:56:47.321 --> 00:56:49.239
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

343
00:56:52.993 --> 00:56:55.829
That'll wake you up in the morning, boy.

344
00:56:55.871 --> 00:56:57.497
There's somebody coming!

345
00:56:57.581 --> 00:56:59.374
Arm yourselves!

346
00:57:05.172 --> 00:57:07.215
There's somebody coming.

347
00:57:08.133 --> 00:57:10.510
MacGregors, from the next glen.

348
00:57:16.266 --> 00:57:18.810
We heard about what was happening.

349
00:57:18.852 --> 00:57:22.522
We don't want you <i>amadans</i> thinking
you can have your fun without us.

350
00:57:22.564 --> 00:57:23.982
-That's right.
-Aye.

351
00:57:24.816 --> 00:57:26.109
Go home.

352
00:57:27.194 --> 00:57:29.196
Some of us are in this.

353
00:57:29.863 --> 00:57:31.823
Can't help that now.

354
00:57:32.491 --> 00:57:35.494
But you can help yourselves. Go home.

355
00:57:35.535 --> 00:57:38.288
We'll have no homes left when
the English garrison from the castle

356
00:57:38.372 --> 00:57:41.124
comes through and burns us out.

357
00:57:41.208 --> 00:57:43.710
-And they will.
-Aye.

358
00:57:45.712 --> 00:57:47.089
Welcome.

359
00:58:17.202 --> 00:58:19.204
Patrol returning, milord!

360
00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:48.734
So what news?

361
00:59:00.495 --> 00:59:03.290
I have dispatched
100 soldiers to Lanark.

362
00:59:03.582 --> 00:59:05.625
They will be returning now!

363
00:59:05.667 --> 00:59:08.128
Were they dressed like this?

364
00:59:08.962 --> 00:59:11.506
Actually, it was more like 50.

365
00:59:11.590 --> 00:59:13.091
Make it quick.

366
00:59:15.844 --> 00:59:17.471
You remember me?

367
00:59:18.972 --> 00:59:21.308
I never did her any harm.
It was my right.

368
00:59:21.391 --> 00:59:22.476
Your right?

369
00:59:22.517 --> 00:59:25.312
Well, I'm here to claim the right
of a husband!

370
00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:34.362
I am William Wallace,

371
00:59:36.615 --> 00:59:39.451
and the rest of you will be spared.

372
00:59:39.493 --> 00:59:42.287
Go back to England and tell them there

373
00:59:43.121 --> 00:59:46.708
that Scotland's daughters
and her sons are yours no more.

374
00:59:48.877 --> 00:59:51.379
Tell them Scotland is free.

375
00:59:57.177 --> 00:59:58.720
Burn it.

376
01:00:13.026 --> 01:00:14.236
Good job, milord.

377
01:00:32.546 --> 01:00:37.050
Scottish rebels have routed
one of my garrisons

378
01:00:37.134 --> 01:00:39.386
and murdered the noble lord.

379
01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:40.929
I heard.

380
01:00:41.012 --> 01:00:43.723
This Wallace is a brigand,
nothing more.

381
01:00:44.266 --> 01:00:46.935
And how would you deal
with this brigand?

382
01:00:47.018 --> 01:00:48.436
Like any common thief.

383
01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:52.274
Have the local magistrate arrest him
and punish him accordingly.

384
01:00:54.818 --> 01:00:56.153
Leave us.

385
01:01:07.164 --> 01:01:09.916
Wallace has already killed
the magistrate

386
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.169
and taken control of the town.

387
01:01:12.919 --> 01:01:14.588
Stand up.

388
01:01:14.629 --> 01:01:15.964
Stand up.

389
01:01:16.923 --> 01:01:18.758
In the morning,

390
01:01:19.885 --> 01:01:22.929
I depart for France
to press our rights there,

391
01:01:23.013 --> 01:01:26.308
and I leave you here
to quell this little rebellion.

392
01:01:26.391 --> 01:01:28.101
Understood? Is it?

393
01:01:32.397 --> 01:01:34.608
One day, you will be a king,

394
01:01:36.318 --> 01:01:38.612
at least try to act like one.

395
01:01:42.449 --> 01:01:44.117
Get away from me!

396
01:01:44.784 --> 01:01:46.995
Convene my military council.

1264
01:01:57.506 --> 01:02:00.509
I hope your husband goes to Scotland

1265
01:02:01.218 --> 01:02:03.970
and meets Wallace...

1266
01:02:04.388 --> 01:02:07.057
and then you'll be a widow.

397
01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:29.829
There!

398
01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:33.959
After them.

399
01:03:01.194 --> 01:03:02.404
No point resisting.

400
01:03:02.487 --> 01:03:04.364
You're outnumbered and trapped.

401
01:03:04.447 --> 01:03:07.575
Now, where are the rest of you?
Where's Wallace?

402
01:03:19.754 --> 01:03:21.047
Father?

403
01:03:21.131 --> 01:03:23.133
Come in. Come in.

404
01:03:23.883 --> 01:03:26.011
A rebellion has begun.

405
01:03:32.684 --> 01:03:34.019
Under whom?

406
01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:37.230
A commoner named William Wallace.

407
01:03:48.116 --> 01:03:50.577
You will embrace this rebellion.

408
01:03:50.952 --> 01:03:53.788
Support it from our lands in the north.

409
01:03:54.331 --> 01:03:56.458
I will gain English favor

410
01:03:56.541 --> 01:04:01.546
by condemning it and ordering it
opposed from our lands in the south.

411
01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:05.425
Sit down. Stay awhile.

412
01:04:12.891 --> 01:04:14.476
This Wallace,

413
01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:20.482
he doesn't even have a knighthood,
but he fights with passion,

414
01:04:20.565 --> 01:04:22.150
and he inspires.

415
01:04:22.776 --> 01:04:25.820
And you wish to charge off
and fight as he did?

416
01:04:27.197 --> 01:04:28.823
So would I.

417
01:04:28.948 --> 01:04:30.450
Well, maybe it's time.

418
01:04:30.492 --> 01:04:33.453
It is time to survive.

419
01:04:34.287 --> 01:04:36.539
You're the 17th Robert Bruce.

420
01:04:37.123 --> 01:04:42.962
The 16 before you passed you land
and title because they didn't charge in.

421
01:04:44.964 --> 01:04:47.801
-Call a meeting of the nobles.
-They do nothing but talk.

422
01:04:47.884 --> 01:04:49.052
Rightly so.

423
01:04:49.135 --> 01:04:52.013
They're as rich in English titles
and lands as they are in Scottish.

424
01:04:52.097 --> 01:04:53.556
Just as we are.

425
01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:56.643
You admire this man,
this William Wallace.

426
01:04:56.684 --> 01:04:59.312
Uncompromising men
are easy to admire.

427
01:04:59.813 --> 01:05:02.148
He has courage, so does a dog.

428
01:05:02.232 --> 01:05:05.318
But it is exactly
the ability to compromise

429
01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:07.362
that makes a man noble.

430
01:05:07.987 --> 01:05:09.656
And understand this,

431
01:05:09.697 --> 01:05:12.325
Edward Longshanks
is the most ruthless king

432
01:05:12.367 --> 01:05:15.120
ever to sit on the throne of England,

433
01:05:15.161 --> 01:05:21.709
and none of us and nothing of Scotland
will remain unless we are as ruthless.

434
01:05:23.336 --> 01:05:25.338
Give ear to our nobles.

435
01:05:26.339 --> 01:05:30.802
Knowing their minds
is the key to the throne.

436
01:05:47.235 --> 01:05:50.113
Wait. Wait. Look.

437
01:05:50.864 --> 01:05:53.199
-This is out, and this is left.
-Of course.

438
01:05:53.241 --> 01:05:54.534
Carry on.

439
01:05:54.617 --> 01:05:56.119
Carry on!

1267
01:06:00.749 --> 01:06:04.336
When the king returns,
he will bury them in those new clothes.

1268
01:06:04.711 --> 01:06:06.713
Scotland is in chaos.

1269
01:06:07.213 --> 01:06:10.342
Your husband is secretly
sending an army north.

1270
01:06:10.425 --> 01:06:12.010
How do you know this?

1271
01:06:12.719 --> 01:06:16.473
Last night I slept with a member
of the War Council.

1272
01:06:16.556 --> 01:06:19.059
He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.

1273
01:06:19.267 --> 01:06:20.268
Ah, yes.

1274
01:06:20.352 --> 01:06:23.021
Englishmen don't know
what a tongue is for.

1275
01:06:27.901 --> 01:06:30.153
This Scottish rebel... Wallace?

1276
01:06:30.236 --> 01:06:31.863
He fights to avenge a woman?

1277
01:06:31.946 --> 01:06:33.698
I nearly forgot.

1278
01:06:33.782 --> 01:06:36.743
A magistrate wished to capture him,

1279
01:06:36.826 --> 01:06:39.537
and found he had a secret lover.

1280
01:06:42.624 --> 01:06:46.211
So he cut the girl's throat
to tempt Wallace to fight...

1281
01:06:46.503 --> 01:06:48.213
and fight he did.

1282
01:06:49.172 --> 01:06:55.345
Knowing his passion for his lost love,
they next plotted to take him

1283
01:06:55.428 --> 01:06:59.474
by desecrating the graves
of his father and brother

1284
01:06:59.933 --> 01:07:03.603
and setting an ambush
at the grave of his love.

1285
01:07:05.063 --> 01:07:08.692
He fought his way through the trap

1286
01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:13.697
and carried her body to a secret place.

1287
01:07:18.618 --> 01:07:20.745
Now that's love, no?

1288
01:07:21.246 --> 01:07:23.248
Love?

1289
01:07:25.375 --> 01:07:26.793
I wouldn't know.

440
01:07:38.638 --> 01:07:39.931
You know,

441
01:07:39.973 --> 01:07:43.142
eventually, Longshanks will send
his whole northern army against us.

442
01:07:43.226 --> 01:07:45.562
Heavy cavalry, armored horse.

443
01:07:46.062 --> 01:07:47.981
Shake the very ground.

444
01:07:49.065 --> 01:07:50.692
They'll ride right over us.

445
01:07:50.775 --> 01:07:53.319
Uncle Argyle used to talk about it,

446
01:07:53.403 --> 01:07:56.823
how no army had ever stood up
to a charge of heavy horse.

447
01:07:56.864 --> 01:08:00.493
-So what do we do?
-Hit, run, hide, the Highland way.

448
01:08:08.668 --> 01:08:10.253
We'll make spears.

449
01:08:11.504 --> 01:08:12.922
Hundreds of them.

450
01:08:13.006 --> 01:08:15.925
Long spears, twice as long as a man.

451
01:08:16.009 --> 01:08:18.052
-That long?
-Aye.

452
01:08:19.345 --> 01:08:21.264
Some men are longer than others.

453
01:08:21.347 --> 01:08:24.684
Your mother been telling you stories
about me again.

454
01:08:26.227 --> 01:08:28.521
Volunteers coming in!

455
01:08:31.274 --> 01:08:32.859
William Wallace,

456
01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:35.403
we've come to fight and to die for you.

457
01:08:35.486 --> 01:08:38.281
Stand up, man. I'm not the Pope.

458
01:08:38.364 --> 01:08:41.242
My name is Faudron. My sword is yours.

459
01:08:41.326 --> 01:08:42.368
I brought you this.

460
01:08:42.452 --> 01:08:44.495
We checked them for arms.

461
01:08:45.538 --> 01:08:47.248
I brought you this.

462
01:08:47.707 --> 01:08:50.418
-My wife made it for you.
-Thank you.

463
01:08:55.256 --> 01:08:57.800
Him? That can't be William Wallace.

464
01:08:57.884 --> 01:09:00.094
I'm prettier than this man.

465
01:09:03.348 --> 01:09:05.725
All right, Father. I'll ask him.

466
01:09:09.687 --> 01:09:14.025
If I risk my neck for you,
will I get a chance to kill Englishmen?

467
01:09:14.067 --> 01:09:17.612
Is your father a ghost,
or do you converse with the Almighty?

468
01:09:17.695 --> 01:09:20.907
In order to find his equal,
an Irishman is forced to talk to God.

469
01:09:20.948 --> 01:09:21.991
Yes, Father?

470
01:09:22.075 --> 01:09:24.202
The Almighty says
don't change the subject,

471
01:09:24.243 --> 01:09:25.828
just answer the fucking question.

472
01:09:25.912 --> 01:09:26.913
Mind your tongue.

473
01:09:26.954 --> 01:09:28.456
Insane Irish.

474
01:09:32.627 --> 01:09:36.297
Smart enough to get a dagger
past your guards, old man.

475
01:09:37.090 --> 01:09:39.258
That's my friend, Irishman,

476
01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:41.386
and the answer to your question is yes.

477
01:09:41.427 --> 01:09:44.389
You fight for me,
you get to kill the English.

478
01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:46.057
Excellent!

479
01:09:46.099 --> 01:09:48.267
Stephen is my name.

480
01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:53.564
I'm the most wanted man on my island,
except I'm not on my island, of course.

481
01:09:53.606 --> 01:09:55.066
More's the pity.

482
01:09:55.108 --> 01:09:57.360
Your island? You mean Ireland?

483
01:09:57.443 --> 01:09:59.028
Yeah. It's mine.

484
01:10:03.616 --> 01:10:05.284
You're a madman.

485
01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:15.044
I've come to the right place, then.

486
01:11:35.166 --> 01:11:38.669
Sure didn't the Almighty
send me to watch your back?

487
01:11:40.213 --> 01:11:42.298
I didn't like him anyway.

488
01:11:44.467 --> 01:11:46.677
He wasn't right in the head.

489
01:12:00.107 --> 01:12:01.234
William!

490
01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:03.152
It's several runners!

491
01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:17.792
The English are advancing
an army toward Stirling.

492
01:12:17.875 --> 01:12:19.043
Do the nobles rally?

493
01:12:19.085 --> 01:12:22.505
Robert the Bruce and most of the others
will not commit to battle,

494
01:12:22.588 --> 01:12:23.923
but word has spread,

495
01:12:24.006 --> 01:12:25.883
and the Highlanders
are coming down on their own.

496
01:12:25.925 --> 01:12:29.262
Aye, in droves of hundreds
and thousands.

497
01:12:29.846 --> 01:12:32.014
Are you ready for a war?

498
01:12:47.446 --> 01:12:49.115
-Well, what news?
-We're outnumbered,

499
01:12:49.156 --> 01:12:50.366
at least three to one.

500
01:12:50.449 --> 01:12:52.952
-How many horse, then?
-Three hundred. Maybe more.

501
01:12:52.994 --> 01:12:54.412
Three hundred heavy horse?

502
01:12:54.453 --> 01:12:57.832
-We must try to negotiate.
-Well, who is in command?

503
01:12:57.915 --> 01:13:01.502
-Did he have a scarlet chevron?
-Aye, he did.

504
01:13:03.045 --> 01:13:04.964
We can still negotiate.

505
01:13:08.342 --> 01:13:10.678
What are they talking about?

506
01:13:10.761 --> 01:13:13.472
I can't hear, but it doesn't look good.

507
01:13:13.556 --> 01:13:15.516
The nobles will negotiate.

508
01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:18.019
They'll do a deal, then we go home.

509
01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:21.105
If not, we charge.

510
01:13:21.147 --> 01:13:24.025
Three hundred heavy horse,
we've no chance.

511
01:14:23.626 --> 01:14:25.044
So many.

512
01:14:29.882 --> 01:14:32.760
I didn't come here to fight
so they could own more lands.

513
01:14:32.843 --> 01:14:35.262
Then I'll have to work for them.

514
01:14:35.346 --> 01:14:36.514
Nor me.

515
01:14:37.848 --> 01:14:41.936
All right, lads!
I'm not dying for these bastards.

516
01:14:42.019 --> 01:14:43.604
Let's go home!

517
01:15:01.455 --> 01:15:04.875
Stop, men ! Do not flee!

518
01:15:04.917 --> 01:15:07.461
Wait until we've negotiated!

519
01:16:00.931 --> 01:16:02.141
William Wallace.

520
01:16:02.224 --> 01:16:04.310
Can't be. Not tall enough.

521
01:16:25.247 --> 01:16:27.833
The Almighty says
this must be a fashionable fight.

522
01:16:27.875 --> 01:16:29.668
It's drawn the finest people.

523
01:16:29.752 --> 01:16:31.337
Where is thy salute?

524
01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:35.216
For presenting yourselves
on this battlefield, I give you thanks.

525
01:16:35.299 --> 01:16:36.842
This is our army.

526
01:16:36.926 --> 01:16:38.511
To join it, you give homage.

527
01:16:38.552 --> 01:16:41.013
I give homage to Scotland,

528
01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:43.849
and if this is your army

529
01:16:44.975 --> 01:16:46.519
why does it go?

530
01:16:46.602 --> 01:16:49.313
We didn't come here to fight for them!

531
01:16:52.691 --> 01:16:55.194
Home! The English are too many.

532
01:17:04.203 --> 01:17:05.996
Sons of Scotland,

533
01:17:07.164 --> 01:17:08.874
I am William Wallace.

534
01:17:08.958 --> 01:17:11.127
William Wallace is seven feet tall.

535
01:17:11.210 --> 01:17:13.212
Yes, I've heard.

536
01:17:13.254 --> 01:17:15.548
He kills men by the hundreds,

537
01:17:15.631 --> 01:17:18.300
and if he were here,
he'd consume the English

538
01:17:18.384 --> 01:17:23.013
with fireballs from his eyes
and bolts of lightning from his arse.

539
01:17:26.142 --> 01:17:28.018
I am William Wallace,

540
01:17:29.603 --> 01:17:33.691
and I see a whole army
of my countrymen

541
01:17:34.275 --> 01:17:36.485
here in defiance of tyranny.

542
01:17:39.905 --> 01:17:42.575
You've come to fight as free men.

543
01:17:44.535 --> 01:17:46.412
And free men you are.

544
01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:52.042
What will you do with that freedom?

545
01:17:54.170 --> 01:17:55.796
Will you fight?

546
01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:58.841
No! No! No!

547
01:17:58.924 --> 01:18:01.135
Fight? Against that? No!

548
01:18:01.552 --> 01:18:03.804
We will run, and we will live.

549
01:18:04.847 --> 01:18:06.098
Aye.

550
01:18:06.182 --> 01:18:08.267
Fight, and you may die.

551
01:18:08.309 --> 01:18:10.269
Run, and you'll live.

552
01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:13.022
At least awhile.

553
01:18:16.275 --> 01:18:19.653
And dying in your beds
many years from now,

554
01:18:20.821 --> 01:18:26.285
would you be willing to trade
all the days from this day to that

555
01:18:26.327 --> 01:18:32.166
for one chance, just one chance,
to come back here and tell our enemies

556
01:18:32.458 --> 01:18:34.710
that they may take our lives,

557
01:18:35.377 --> 01:18:38.631
but they'll never take our freedom?

558
01:19:05.950 --> 01:19:07.952
They seem quite optimistic to me.

559
01:19:07.993 --> 01:19:09.203
Maybe they do want to fight.

560
01:19:09.286 --> 01:19:12.873
Confrontation might be
a foregone conclusion, milord,

561
01:19:12.957 --> 01:19:16.126
but, nonetheless, I think
we should deliver the king's terms.

562
01:19:16.168 --> 01:19:19.421
The king's terms?
He'll never live up to them.

563
01:19:19.505 --> 01:19:21.006
Milord, I think...

564
01:19:21.090 --> 01:19:23.676
All right. Offer them the terms.

565
01:19:26.762 --> 01:19:29.014
They're coming out.
Shall we go and meet them?

566
01:19:29.056 --> 01:19:31.392
-Let me do the talking. Agreed?
-Agreed.

567
01:19:37.690 --> 01:19:39.817
Fine speech.

568
01:19:39.858 --> 01:19:41.610
Now what do we do?

569
01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:45.197
Just be yourselves.

570
01:19:45.739 --> 01:19:47.408
Where are you going?

571
01:19:47.491 --> 01:19:49.535
I'm going to pick a fight.

572
01:19:56.208 --> 01:19:59.545
Well, we didn't get dressed up
for nothing.

573
01:20:02.089 --> 01:20:04.133
Mornay, Lochlan, Craig.

574
01:20:09.138 --> 01:20:11.348
Here are the king's terms.

575
01:20:11.390 --> 01:20:14.560
Lead this army off the field,

576
01:20:18.731 --> 01:20:21.817
and he will give you each
estates in Yorkshire,

577
01:20:22.776 --> 01:20:25.112
including hereditary title,

578
01:20:25.195 --> 01:20:27.740
from which you will pay...

579
01:20:27.781 --> 01:20:29.908
From which you will pay him
an annual duty...

580
01:20:29.950 --> 01:20:31.410
I have an offer for you.

581
01:20:31.493 --> 01:20:33.996
Cheltham, this is William Wallace.

582
01:20:35.706 --> 01:20:38.083
From which you will pay the king
an annual duty...

583
01:20:38.125 --> 01:20:39.501
I said I have an offer for you.

584
01:20:39.585 --> 01:20:41.253
You disrespect a banner of truce?

585
01:20:41.295 --> 01:20:43.380
From his king? Absolutely.

586
01:20:44.548 --> 01:20:46.633
Here are Scotland's terms.

587
01:20:47.092 --> 01:20:50.596
Lower your flags
and march straight back to England,

588
01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:53.307
stopping at every home you pass by
to beg forgiveness

589
01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:56.268
for 100 years of theft, rape and murder.

590
01:20:56.935 --> 01:20:59.730
Do that and your men shall live.

591
01:20:59.772 --> 01:21:02.941
Do it not
and every one of you will die today.

592
01:21:10.074 --> 01:21:11.992
You are outmatched.

593
01:21:12.076 --> 01:21:13.911
You have no heavy cavalry.

594
01:21:13.952 --> 01:21:16.330
In two centuries, no army has won...

595
01:21:16.413 --> 01:21:18.040
I'm not finished!

596
01:21:20.292 --> 01:21:22.336
Before we let you leave,

597
01:21:22.795 --> 01:21:27.716
your commander must cross that field,
present himself before this army,

598
01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:29.843
put his head between his legs,

599
01:21:29.927 --> 01:21:31.804
and kiss his own arse.

600
01:21:42.398 --> 01:21:44.983
I'd say that was rather less cordial
than he was used to.

601
01:21:45.025 --> 01:21:47.319
You be ready and do exactly as I say.

602
01:21:47.403 --> 01:21:48.487
On my signal,

603
01:21:48.529 --> 01:21:51.615
ride round behind our position
and flank them.

604
01:21:51.657 --> 01:21:53.158
We must not divide our forces.

605
01:21:53.242 --> 01:21:56.120
Do it and let the English see you do it.

606
01:21:57.329 --> 01:21:59.540
They'll think we run away.

607
01:21:59.623 --> 01:22:02.418
Take out their archers.
I'll meet you in the middle.

608
01:22:02.501 --> 01:22:04.044
Right. Come on.

609
01:22:28.527 --> 01:22:30.362
Insolent bastard.

610
01:22:30.446 --> 01:22:33.323
I want this Wallace's heart on a plate.

611
01:22:33.365 --> 01:22:34.741
Archers.

612
01:22:34.825 --> 01:22:37.494
-Archers! Archers!
-Archers!

613
01:22:43.417 --> 01:22:47.171
-Archers, forward !
-Archers, forward!

614
01:23:43.101 --> 01:23:44.603
You bastards!

615
01:24:19.304 --> 01:24:20.597
Loose!

616
01:24:40.826 --> 01:24:43.453
The Lord tells me he can get me
out of this mess,

617
01:24:43.495 --> 01:24:46.039
but he's pretty sure you're fucked.

618
01:25:07.311 --> 01:25:08.854
-Ready!
-Loose!

619
01:25:26.705 --> 01:25:28.248
Ride!

620
01:25:32.628 --> 01:25:35.422
See, every Scot with a horse is fleeing.

621
01:25:35.505 --> 01:25:38.550
Our cavalry will ride them down
like grass.

622
01:25:38.634 --> 01:25:40.135
Send the horse.

623
01:25:40.218 --> 01:25:41.887
Full attack.

624
01:26:56.294 --> 01:26:58.004
Steady!

625
01:26:59.297 --> 01:27:00.799
Hold!

626
01:27:02.801 --> 01:27:04.344
Hold!

627
01:27:08.974 --> 01:27:10.058
Hold!

628
01:27:14.855 --> 01:27:16.106
Hold!

629
01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:31.121
Now!

630
01:28:16.541 --> 01:28:18.001
Send the infantry.

631
01:28:18.043 --> 01:28:20.086
-Milord...
-You lead them!

632
01:30:39.476 --> 01:30:40.894
Retreat!

633
01:31:15.637 --> 01:31:18.431
Bastard!

634
01:32:00.974 --> 01:32:02.600
All right.

635
01:32:32.297 --> 01:32:35.675
-Wallace!
-Wallace!

636
01:32:52.567 --> 01:32:54.861
Wallace! Wallace!

637
01:32:56.112 --> 01:32:59.199
Wallace! Wallace!

638
01:32:59.324 --> 01:33:03.119
Wallace! Wallace!

639
01:33:14.881 --> 01:33:18.218
I knight thee Sir William Wallace.

640
01:33:22.764 --> 01:33:25.016
Sir William, in the name of God,

641
01:33:25.100 --> 01:33:28.770
we declare and appoint thee guardian
and high protector of Scotland

642
01:33:28.853 --> 01:33:32.023
and thy captains as aides-de-camp.

643
01:33:32.065 --> 01:33:34.234
Stand and be recognized.

644
01:33:46.162 --> 01:33:48.039
Does anyone know his politics?

645
01:33:48.081 --> 01:33:51.709
No, but his weight with the commoners
could unbalance everything.

646
01:33:51.793 --> 01:33:55.380
The Balliols will kiss his arse,
and so we must.

647
01:34:03.012 --> 01:34:04.556
Sir William.

648
01:34:08.893 --> 01:34:10.603
Sir William,

649
01:34:10.687 --> 01:34:14.732
inasmuch as you and your captains hail
from a region

650
01:34:14.774 --> 01:34:17.652
long known to support the Balliol clan,

651
01:34:17.735 --> 01:34:20.572
may we invite you
to continue your support

652
01:34:20.613 --> 01:34:23.366
and uphold our rightful claim?

653
01:34:23.575 --> 01:34:25.368
Damn the Balliol clan!

654
01:34:25.410 --> 01:34:27.912
They're all Longshanks' men!

655
01:34:28.454 --> 01:34:32.250
Gentlemen. Gentlemen!

656
01:34:32.292 --> 01:34:35.170
-Now is the time to declare a king.
-Wait!

657
01:34:35.253 --> 01:34:38.256
And you're prepared to recognize
our legitimate succession, I take it.

658
01:34:38.298 --> 01:34:40.216
You're the ones who won't
support the rightful king.

659
01:34:40.258 --> 01:34:42.051
Those were lies
when you first wrote them.

660
01:34:42.093 --> 01:34:43.761
-No.
-That's the truth.

661
01:34:44.095 --> 01:34:46.014
I demand recognition
of these documents!

662
01:34:46.097 --> 01:34:49.100
These documents were lies
when you wrote them!

663
01:34:51.227 --> 01:34:53.396
Gentlemen, please! Gentlemen!

664
01:34:53.479 --> 01:34:55.106
Please, gentlemen!

665
01:34:55.231 --> 01:34:57.984
Wait! Sir William, where are you going?

666
01:35:00.278 --> 01:35:04.782
We have beaten the English,
but they'll come back

667
01:35:04.824 --> 01:35:07.535
because you won't stand together.

668
01:35:07.619 --> 01:35:08.828
What will you do?

669
01:35:08.912 --> 01:35:10.788
I will invade England

670
01:35:10.872 --> 01:35:13.708
and defeat the English
on their own ground.

671
01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:18.129
Invade? That's impossible.

672
01:35:18.213 --> 01:35:19.631
Why?

673
01:35:19.714 --> 01:35:21.758
Why is that impossible?

674
01:35:21.799 --> 01:35:26.638
You're so concerned with squabbling
for the scraps from Longshanks' table

675
01:35:26.679 --> 01:35:30.850
that you've missed your God-given right
to something better.

676
01:35:30.934 --> 01:35:33.394
There's a difference between us.

677
01:35:33.478 --> 01:35:35.146
You think the people
of this country exist

678
01:35:35.188 --> 01:35:37.941
to provide you with position.

679
01:35:37.982 --> 01:35:42.070
I think your position exists
to provide those people with freedom,

680
01:35:43.363 --> 01:35:46.115
and I go to make sure that they have it.

681
01:35:59.003 --> 01:36:00.505
Wait!

682
01:36:03.925 --> 01:36:05.510
I respect what you said,

683
01:36:05.551 --> 01:36:09.013
but remember that these men
have lands and castles.

684
01:36:09.681 --> 01:36:10.848
It's much to risk.

685
01:36:10.932 --> 01:36:12.850
And the common man that bleeds
on the battlefield,

686
01:36:12.892 --> 01:36:14.644
does he risk less?

687
01:36:19.524 --> 01:36:20.817
No.

688
01:36:21.150 --> 01:36:24.445
But from top to bottom,
this country has got no sense of itself.

689
01:36:24.529 --> 01:36:27.699
Its nobles share allegiance
with England.

690
01:36:27.782 --> 01:36:29.534
Its clans war with each other.

691
01:36:29.575 --> 01:36:31.035
-Aye.
-Aye.

692
01:36:32.370 --> 01:36:34.998
If you make enemies on both sides
of the border,

693
01:36:35.039 --> 01:36:36.499
you'll end up dead.

694
01:36:36.541 --> 01:36:39.210
We all end up dead.
It's just a question of how and why.

695
01:36:39.252 --> 01:36:43.339
I'm not a coward. I want what you want,
but we need the nobles.

696
01:36:43.381 --> 01:36:45.091
-We need them?
-Aye.

697
01:36:45.174 --> 01:36:46.384
Nobles.

698
01:36:47.552 --> 01:36:50.305
Now, tell me, what does that mean,
to be noble?

699
01:36:50.388 --> 01:36:53.057
Your title gives you claim
to the throne of our country,

700
01:36:53.141 --> 01:36:55.685
but men don't follow titles.

701
01:36:55.727 --> 01:36:57.437
They follow courage.

702
01:36:57.520 --> 01:36:59.397
Now, our people know you.

703
01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:01.107
Noble and common, they respect you,

704
01:37:01.190 --> 01:37:04.819
and if you would
just lead them to freedom,

705
01:37:07.196 --> 01:37:08.906
they'd follow you.

706
01:37:11.075 --> 01:37:12.618
And so would I.

707
01:37:34.515 --> 01:37:36.059
Damn it!

708
01:37:36.100 --> 01:37:39.062
My sodomite cousin the prince
tells me he has no troops to lend,

709
01:37:39.103 --> 01:37:42.648
and every town in northern England
is begging for help.

710
01:37:44.192 --> 01:37:45.777
-He advances!
-To which town?

711
01:37:45.818 --> 01:37:47.612
To here, milord.

712
01:37:48.279 --> 01:37:49.906
Bring the food and provisions inside.

713
01:37:49.947 --> 01:37:52.450
Double the wall guards, seal the gate.
Now!

714
01:37:54.118 --> 01:37:56.162
Bring in the provisions!

715
01:38:25.733 --> 01:38:28.152
Sir, we can get you out if you leave now.

716
01:38:28.194 --> 01:38:29.695
I'm not about to tell my uncle

717
01:38:29.779 --> 01:38:33.116
I've lost him the greatest city
in northern England.

718
01:39:13.156 --> 01:39:14.449
Come on!

719
01:39:49.525 --> 01:39:51.402
Make way for the king!

720
01:40:00.578 --> 01:40:02.413
It's not your fault.

721
01:40:03.247 --> 01:40:04.582
Stand up to him!

722
01:40:04.624 --> 01:40:07.293
I will stand up to him and more.

723
01:40:44.997 --> 01:40:46.999
What news of the north?

724
01:40:48.751 --> 01:40:50.294
Nothing new, Your Majesty.

725
01:40:50.336 --> 01:40:52.672
We've sent riders to speed any word.

726
01:40:52.755 --> 01:40:54.590
I heard the word in France,

727
01:40:54.632 --> 01:40:58.010
where I was fighting
to expand your future kingdom.

728
01:40:58.636 --> 01:40:59.929
The word, my son,

729
01:40:59.971 --> 01:41:04.141
is that our entire
northern army is annihilated,

730
01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:07.937
and you have done nothing.

731
01:41:09.021 --> 01:41:10.690
I have ordered conscriptions, sir.

732
01:41:10.773 --> 01:41:13.651
They're assembled and ready to depart.

733
01:41:15.111 --> 01:41:18.447
Excuse me, sire, but there's
a very urgent message from York.

734
01:41:18.489 --> 01:41:19.991
Come.

735
01:41:28.291 --> 01:41:30.418
-Leave us.
-Thank you, sire.

736
01:41:33.671 --> 01:41:36.340
-Wallace has sacked York.
-What?

737
01:41:36.632 --> 01:41:38.634
Wallace has sacked York!

738
01:41:54.358 --> 01:41:56.861
Sire, thy own nephew.

739
01:41:58.321 --> 01:42:00.740
What beast could do such a thing?

740
01:42:02.450 --> 01:42:04.368
If he can sack York,

741
01:42:07.163 --> 01:42:09.165
he can invade lower England.

742
01:42:09.206 --> 01:42:11.042
We would stop him!

743
01:42:13.544 --> 01:42:18.132
Who is this person who speaks to me
as though I needed his advice?

744
01:42:20.217 --> 01:42:22.637
I have declared Phillip
my high counselor.

745
01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:24.221
Is he qualified?

746
01:42:24.305 --> 01:42:28.601
I am skilled in the arts of war
and military tactics, sire.

747
01:42:29.435 --> 01:42:30.728
Are you?

748
01:42:32.021 --> 01:42:35.608
Then tell me,
what advice would you offer

749
01:42:35.691 --> 01:42:38.944
on the present situation?

750
01:43:09.892 --> 01:43:11.936
I shall offer a truce

751
01:43:13.479 --> 01:43:15.439
and buy him off.

752
01:43:17.274 --> 01:43:20.611
But who will go to him? Not I.

753
01:43:21.445 --> 01:43:27.243
If I fell under the sword of that murderer,
it might be my head in a basket.

754
01:43:28.411 --> 01:43:31.789
And not my gentle son.

755
01:43:32.164 --> 01:43:33.457
The mere sight of him

756
01:43:33.499 --> 01:43:37.378
would only encourage an enemy
to take over the whole country.

757
01:43:40.214 --> 01:43:42.717
So whom do I send?

758
01:43:47.138 --> 01:43:48.472
Whom do I send?

759
01:45:11.764 --> 01:45:13.224
I'm dreaming.

760
01:45:13.808 --> 01:45:15.351
Yes, you are.

761
01:45:17.144 --> 01:45:18.896
And you must wake.

762
01:45:27.655 --> 01:45:29.532
I don't want to wake.

763
01:45:31.408 --> 01:45:33.702
I want to stay here with you.

764
01:45:34.745 --> 01:45:36.705
And I with you,

765
01:45:37.414 --> 01:45:39.333
but you must wake now.

766
01:45:42.670 --> 01:45:44.588
Wake up, William.

767
01:45:44.922 --> 01:45:46.298
Wake up.

768
01:45:48.425 --> 01:45:50.553
<i>William, wake up, wake up.</i>

769
01:45:51.178 --> 01:45:52.346
William!

770
01:45:52.429 --> 01:45:56.100
A royal entourage comes,
flying banners of truce

771
01:45:56.183 --> 01:45:58.936
and the standards
of Longshanks himself!

772
01:46:42.897 --> 01:46:44.982
I am the Princess of Wales.

773
01:46:45.024 --> 01:46:48.027
I come as the king's servant
and with his authority.

774
01:46:49.028 --> 01:46:50.529
To do what?

775
01:46:51.530 --> 01:46:53.866
To discuss the king's proposals.

776
01:46:55.826 --> 01:46:57.995
Will you speak with a woman?

777
01:47:18.349 --> 01:47:21.393
I understand you have recently
been given the rank of knight.

778
01:47:21.477 --> 01:47:23.687
I have been given nothing.

779
01:47:24.063 --> 01:47:26.273
God makes men what they are.

780
01:47:26.815 --> 01:47:29.652
Did God make you the sacker
of peaceful cities,

781
01:47:29.693 --> 01:47:33.489
the executioner of the king's nephew,
my husband's own cousin?

782
01:47:34.448 --> 01:47:38.494
York was the staging point
for every invasion of my country,

783
01:47:39.370 --> 01:47:41.330
and that royal cousin
hanged innocent Scots,

784
01:47:41.372 --> 01:47:44.375
even women and children,
from the city walls.

785
01:47:47.711 --> 01:47:51.632
Longshanks did far worse
the last time he took a Scottish city.

1290
01:47:52.633 --> 01:47:55.136
He is a bloody murdering savage.

1291
01:47:55.219 --> 01:47:57.263
And he's telling lies.

1292
01:47:57.346 --> 01:47:59.515
I never lie.

1293
01:48:02.309 --> 01:48:04.270
But I am a savage.

1294
01:48:07.398 --> 01:48:09.608
Or in French if you prefer?

786
01:48:11.527 --> 01:48:13.779
You ask your king to his face.

787
01:48:13.862 --> 01:48:15.114
Ask him.

788
01:48:17.741 --> 01:48:21.036
You see if his eyes can convince you
of the truth.

789
01:48:28.794 --> 01:48:30.921
Hamilton, leave us.

790
01:48:33.090 --> 01:48:35.551
-Milady...
-Leave us. Now.

791
01:48:47.354 --> 01:48:49.314
Let us talk plainly.

792
01:48:49.398 --> 01:48:51.775
You invade England,

793
01:48:51.817 --> 01:48:55.904
but you cannot complete the conquest
so far from your shelter and supply.

794
01:48:57.448 --> 01:48:59.450
The king desires peace.

795
01:49:00.367 --> 01:49:01.994
Longshanks desires peace?

796
01:49:02.077 --> 01:49:04.580
He declares it to me. I swear it.

797
01:49:04.621 --> 01:49:06.957
He proposes that
you withdraw your attack.

798
01:49:06.999 --> 01:49:10.085
In return, he grants you title, estates,

799
01:49:10.127 --> 01:49:14.214
and this chest of gold,
which I am to pay to you personally.

800
01:49:14.298 --> 01:49:16.300
A lordship and titles.

801
01:49:16.341 --> 01:49:17.342
Gold.

802
01:49:17.426 --> 01:49:19.136
That I should become Judas?

803
01:49:19.178 --> 01:49:20.763
Peace is made in such ways.

804
01:49:20.804 --> 01:49:23.098
Slaves are made in such ways!

805
01:49:25.851 --> 01:49:29.563
The last time Longshanks spoke
of peace, I was a boy,

806
01:49:29.646 --> 01:49:32.024
and many Scottish nobles,
who would not be slaves,

807
01:49:32.107 --> 01:49:34.193
were lured by him, under a flag of truce,

808
01:49:34.276 --> 01:49:37.488
to a barn where he had them hanged.

809
01:49:39.156 --> 01:49:40.824
I was very young,

810
01:49:41.492 --> 01:49:44.369
but I remember Longshanks' notion
of peace.

811
01:49:48.165 --> 01:49:50.918
I understand you have suffered.

812
01:49:51.877 --> 01:49:54.379
I know about your woman.

813
01:50:05.891 --> 01:50:07.893
She was my wife.

814
01:50:10.395 --> 01:50:11.522
We married in secret

815
01:50:11.563 --> 01:50:14.900
because I would not share her
with an English lord.

816
01:50:16.026 --> 01:50:18.904
They killed her to get to me.

817
01:50:24.368 --> 01:50:26.495
I have never spoken of it.

818
01:50:28.122 --> 01:50:31.041
I don't know why I tell you now,

819
01:50:34.086 --> 01:50:36.380
except I see her strength in you.

820
01:50:42.219 --> 01:50:44.471
One day, you'll be a queen,

821
01:50:46.849 --> 01:50:49.017
and you must open your eyes.

822
01:50:56.316 --> 01:51:01.321
You tell your king that William Wallace
will not be ruled,

823
01:51:02.072 --> 01:51:04.575
and nor will any Scot while I live.

824
01:51:38.025 --> 01:51:42.613
My son's loyal wife returns unkilled
by the heathen.

825
01:51:42.696 --> 01:51:44.114
So he accepted our bribe?

826
01:51:44.198 --> 01:51:45.782
No, he did not.

827
01:51:47.618 --> 01:51:49.494
Then why does he stay?

828
01:51:49.578 --> 01:51:52.789
My scouts tell me
that he has not advanced.

829
01:51:52.831 --> 01:51:54.958
He waits for you at York.

830
01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.794
He says he will attack
no more towns or cities

831
01:51:57.836 --> 01:52:00.589
if you are man enough
to come and face him.

832
01:52:00.631 --> 01:52:01.924
Did he?

833
01:52:03.008 --> 01:52:06.845
The Welsh bowmen will not be detected

834
01:52:06.929 --> 01:52:11.016
arriving so far around his flank.

835
01:52:11.642 --> 01:52:15.771
The main force of our armies
from France will land here

836
01:52:15.812 --> 01:52:17.814
to the north of Edinburgh.

837
01:52:17.898 --> 01:52:23.695
Conscripts from Ireland will approach
from the southwest to here.

838
01:52:23.779 --> 01:52:27.491
Welsh bowmen? Troops from France?
Irish conscripts?

839
01:52:27.574 --> 01:52:30.911
Even if you dispatch them today,
they'd take weeks to assemble.

840
01:52:30.994 --> 01:52:34.623
I dispatched them
before I sent your wife.

841
01:52:39.378 --> 01:52:41.838
So our little ruse succeeded.

842
01:52:41.880 --> 01:52:43.924
Thank you.

843
01:52:44.007 --> 01:52:47.844
And while this upstart awaits
my arrival in York,

844
01:52:47.886 --> 01:52:51.682
my forces will have arrived
in Edinburgh behind him.

845
01:52:53.016 --> 01:52:59.439
You spoke with this Wallace in private.

846
01:53:00.399 --> 01:53:01.858
Tell me,

847
01:53:03.652 --> 01:53:05.570
what kind of man is he?

848
01:53:06.947 --> 01:53:08.865
A mindless barbarian.

849
01:53:10.117 --> 01:53:12.286
Not a king like you, milord.

850
01:53:14.538 --> 01:53:16.957
You may return to your embroidery.

851
01:53:17.624 --> 01:53:19.543
Humbly, milord.

852
01:53:19.626 --> 01:53:22.296
You brought back the money, of course.

853
01:53:25.757 --> 01:53:30.470
No. I gave it to ease the suffering
of the children of this war.

854
01:53:32.764 --> 01:53:35.642
That's what happens
when you send a woman.

855
01:53:37.519 --> 01:53:39.229
Forgive me, sire.

856
01:53:39.271 --> 01:53:43.358
I thought that generosity
might demonstrate your greatness

857
01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:45.736
to those you mean to rule.

858
01:53:48.196 --> 01:53:51.783
My greatness will be
better demonstrated

859
01:53:51.867 --> 01:53:57.247
when Wallace returns to Scotland
and finds his country in ashes.

860
01:54:02.044 --> 01:54:03.462
William!

861
01:54:03.545 --> 01:54:05.547
There's riders approaching!

862
01:54:12.804 --> 01:54:15.807
Personal escort of the princess.

863
01:54:15.891 --> 01:54:17.392
Aye.

864
01:54:18.185 --> 01:54:20.437
Must have made an impression.

865
01:54:21.271 --> 01:54:22.397
Aye.

866
01:54:22.439 --> 01:54:25.442
I didn't think you were
in the tent that long.

867
01:54:29.112 --> 01:54:30.614
<i>Mademoiselle.</i>

868
01:55:00.727 --> 01:55:03.647
It's true! English ships are moving
up from the south!

869
01:55:03.688 --> 01:55:06.817
I don't know about the Welsh yet,
but the Irish have landed!

870
01:55:06.858 --> 01:55:09.945
I had to see it with me own eyes
before I could believe it.

871
01:55:09.986 --> 01:55:12.322
What the hell are the Irish doing
fighting with the English?

872
01:55:12.406 --> 01:55:14.116
I wouldn't worry about them.

873
01:55:14.157 --> 01:55:18.328
Didn't I tell you before? It's my island.

874
01:55:18.370 --> 01:55:21.998
Hamish, ride ahead to Edinburgh
and assemble the council.

875
01:55:22.040 --> 01:55:23.750
-Order it.
-Aye.

876
01:55:28.338 --> 01:55:31.299
-Your island?
-My island ! Yup!

877
01:55:32.676 --> 01:55:34.052
You want to negotiate?

878
01:55:34.136 --> 01:55:35.512
No, please, gentlemen!

879
01:55:35.554 --> 01:55:37.973
Lords, Craig is right!

880
01:55:38.014 --> 01:55:41.184
This time,
our only option is to negotiate.

881
01:55:41.268 --> 01:55:44.771
Now, unless you want to see Edinburgh
razed to the ground...

882
01:55:51.194 --> 01:55:54.573
My army has marched for more days
than I can remember

883
01:55:54.656 --> 01:55:56.491
and we still have preparations to make,

884
01:55:56.533 --> 01:55:58.702
so I'll make this plain.

885
01:55:59.953 --> 01:56:02.372
We require every soldier
you can summon.

886
01:56:02.456 --> 01:56:05.375
Your personal escorts, even yourselves,

887
01:56:05.834 --> 01:56:07.627
and we need them now.

888
01:56:09.171 --> 01:56:12.549
With such a force arrayed against us,
it's time to discuss other options.

889
01:56:12.632 --> 01:56:14.217
Other options?

890
01:56:15.719 --> 01:56:19.639
Don't you wish at least
to lead your men onto the field

891
01:56:19.723 --> 01:56:22.100
and barter a better deal
with Longshanks

892
01:56:22.184 --> 01:56:23.977
before you tuck tail and run?

893
01:56:24.060 --> 01:56:25.937
-Sir William...
-We can't defeat this army!

894
01:56:26.021 --> 01:56:27.814
-We can ! And we will !
-Sir William!

895
01:56:31.276 --> 01:56:34.112
We won at Stirling,
and still you quibble!

896
01:56:35.989 --> 01:56:38.825
We won at York,
and you would not support us.

897
01:56:39.367 --> 01:56:43.288
If you'll not stand up with us now,
then I say you're cowards.

898
01:56:48.919 --> 01:56:52.756
And if you are Scotsmen,
I'm ashamed to call myself one.

899
01:56:53.507 --> 01:56:56.301
Please, Sir William,
speak with me alone.

900
01:56:58.512 --> 01:56:59.971
I beg you.

901
01:57:03.350 --> 01:57:06.019
Now, you've achieved more
than anyone ever dreamed,

902
01:57:06.102 --> 01:57:09.898
but fighting these odds,
it looks like rage, not courage.

903
01:57:09.940 --> 01:57:11.900
It's well beyond rage.

904
01:57:13.860 --> 01:57:15.445
Help me.

905
01:57:17.072 --> 01:57:20.283
In the name of Christ, help yourselves!

906
01:57:20.325 --> 01:57:22.285
Now is our chance. Now.

907
01:57:22.994 --> 01:57:24.454
If we join, we can win.

908
01:57:24.538 --> 01:57:28.667
If we win, well, then we'll have
what none of us have ever had before.

909
01:57:29.626 --> 01:57:31.127
A country of our own.

910
01:57:33.380 --> 01:57:35.507
You're the rightful leader,

911
01:57:35.590 --> 01:57:37.634
and there is strength in you. I see it.

912
01:57:43.139 --> 01:57:44.474
Unite us.

913
01:57:47.978 --> 01:57:49.145
Unite us!

914
01:57:49.229 --> 01:57:51.106
Unite the clans.

915
01:57:57.487 --> 01:57:58.863
All right.

916
01:57:58.947 --> 01:58:00.448
Right.

917
01:58:05.620 --> 01:58:07.539
This cannot be the way.

918
01:58:08.248 --> 01:58:12.669
You said yourself,
the nobles will not support Wallace.

919
01:58:14.337 --> 01:58:18.508
So how does it help us
to join the side that is slaughtered?

920
01:58:19.342 --> 01:58:21.344
I gave him my word.

921
01:58:29.728 --> 01:58:31.521
I know it is hard.

922
01:58:32.355 --> 01:58:34.024
Being a leader is.

923
01:58:35.317 --> 01:58:36.651
Now, Son...

924
01:58:37.819 --> 01:58:40.488
Son, look at me.

925
01:58:48.163 --> 01:58:49.873
I cannot be king.

926
01:58:50.749 --> 01:58:53.835
You and you alone can rule Scotland.

927
01:58:54.377 --> 01:58:57.047
What I tell you, you must do.

928
01:58:57.088 --> 01:58:59.758
Not for me, not for yourself,

929
01:58:59.841 --> 01:59:01.843
for your country.

930
01:59:17.484 --> 01:59:19.319
Lads, make way.

931
01:59:19.569 --> 01:59:20.570
Coming through you.

932
01:59:27.494 --> 01:59:29.245
Make way, lads.

933
01:59:29.329 --> 01:59:30.830
Make...

934
01:59:34.542 --> 01:59:37.128
The Bruce is not coming, William.

935
01:59:37.754 --> 01:59:39.589
He'll come.

936
01:59:40.590 --> 01:59:43.051
Mornay and Lochlan have come,

937
01:59:44.761 --> 01:59:46.513
so will the Bruce.

938
01:59:49.599 --> 01:59:53.269
Quite a lovely gathering.

939
01:59:54.354 --> 01:59:56.189
Wouldn't you agree?

940
01:59:59.734 --> 02:00:01.152
The archers are ready, sire.

941
02:00:01.236 --> 02:00:02.862
Not the archers.

942
02:00:02.946 --> 02:00:04.989
My scouts tell me
their archers are miles away

943
02:00:05.073 --> 02:00:06.449
and no threat to us.

944
02:00:06.533 --> 02:00:10.954
Arrows cost money. Use up the Irish.
The dead cost nothing.

945
02:00:10.995 --> 02:00:14.124
And send in the infantry and cavalry.

946
02:00:14.207 --> 02:00:15.625
Infantry!

947
02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:17.419
-Infantry!
-Infantry!

948
02:00:17.460 --> 02:00:18.670
Cavalry!

949
02:00:18.753 --> 02:00:20.213
-Cavalry!
-Cavalry!

950
02:00:20.296 --> 02:00:22.006
-Cavalry!
-Cavalry!

951
02:00:22.632 --> 02:00:23.842
Advance!

952
02:00:24.092 --> 02:00:26.261
-Advance!
-Advance!

953
02:01:50.386 --> 02:01:53.556
-Good to see you this morning !
-Hi. How are you?

954
02:01:55.391 --> 02:01:57.352
Irish.

955
02:01:57.393 --> 02:01:58.645
Glad to have you with us.

956
02:01:58.728 --> 02:02:00.146
Watch this.

957
02:04:10.985 --> 02:04:13.154
Mornay? Lochlan?

958
02:04:13.196 --> 02:04:15.907
I gave Mornay double his lands
in Scotland

959
02:04:15.990 --> 02:04:18.201
with matching estates in England.

960
02:04:18.284 --> 02:04:21.704
Lochlan turned for much less.

961
02:04:22.497 --> 02:04:23.748
Archers.

962
02:04:23.831 --> 02:04:25.249
I beg pardon, sire.

963
02:04:25.333 --> 02:04:27.543
Won't we hit our own troops?

964
02:04:29.420 --> 02:04:31.047
Yes,

965
02:04:31.130 --> 02:04:33.216
but we'll hit theirs as well.

966
02:04:33.257 --> 02:04:34.926
We have reserves.

967
02:04:36.260 --> 02:04:37.845
Attack.

968
02:04:39.055 --> 02:04:40.223
Archers!

969
02:04:41.224 --> 02:04:43.226
-Archers.
-Archers.

970
02:04:47.981 --> 02:04:49.232
Loose!

971
02:04:55.989 --> 02:04:57.615
Loose!

972
02:05:18.136 --> 02:05:20.555
Send in our reinforcements.

973
02:05:20.888 --> 02:05:22.557
Send in the rest!

974
02:05:33.026 --> 02:05:34.736
Bring me Wallace.

975
02:05:35.570 --> 02:05:36.779
Alive, if possible.

976
02:05:36.863 --> 02:05:39.115
Dead, just as good.

977
02:05:40.283 --> 02:05:42.452
Send us news of our victory.

978
02:05:42.493 --> 02:05:44.537
Shall we retire?

979
02:07:09.163 --> 02:07:10.832
Protect the king.

980
02:09:14.538 --> 02:09:15.831
Get up!

981
02:09:16.624 --> 02:09:18.167
Get up!

982
02:09:19.669 --> 02:09:20.920
Up!

983
02:09:21.003 --> 02:09:22.338
Get up!

984
02:09:22.838 --> 02:09:24.715
-Get him out of here!
-Jesus!

985
02:09:29.887 --> 02:09:31.555
Go!

986
02:10:31.615 --> 02:10:33.075
I'm dying.

987
02:10:36.829 --> 02:10:38.247
Let me be.

988
02:10:44.128 --> 02:10:45.254
No.

989
02:10:46.630 --> 02:10:48.591
You're going to live.

990
02:10:50.343 --> 02:10:53.387
I've lived long enough to live free.

991
02:10:53.929 --> 02:10:58.142
Proud to see you become
the man you are.

992
02:11:03.647 --> 02:11:05.775
I'm a happy man.

993
02:12:54.758 --> 02:12:57.887
I'm the one who's rotting,

994
02:12:57.928 --> 02:13:01.807
but I think your face looks graver
than mine.

995
02:13:06.061 --> 02:13:07.605
Son,

996
02:13:13.652 --> 02:13:17.281
we must have alliance with England
to prevail here.

997
02:13:18.199 --> 02:13:20.242
You achieved that.

998
02:13:20.284 --> 02:13:24.079
You saved your family,
increased your land.

999
02:13:24.830 --> 02:13:28.792
In time, you will have
all the power in Scotland.

1000
02:13:29.668 --> 02:13:35.257
Lands, titles, men, power, nothing.

1001
02:13:35.925 --> 02:13:38.636
-Nothing?
-I have nothing.

1002
02:13:39.970 --> 02:13:41.430
Men fight for me

1003
02:13:42.056 --> 02:13:44.433
because if they do not,
I throw them off my land

1004
02:13:44.517 --> 02:13:47.770
and I starve their wives
and their children.

1005
02:13:47.811 --> 02:13:52.983
Those men who bled the ground red
at Falkirk,

1006
02:13:54.485 --> 02:13:55.611
they fought for William Wallace,

1007
02:13:55.653 --> 02:13:59.448
and he fights for something
that I've never had.

1008
02:14:02.451 --> 02:14:04.828
And I took it from him
when I betrayed him,

1009
02:14:04.912 --> 02:14:08.374
and I saw it in his face
on the battlefield,

1010
02:14:08.457 --> 02:14:10.543
and it's tearing me apart!

1011
02:14:11.377 --> 02:14:14.338
All men betray, all lose heart.

1012
02:14:14.421 --> 02:14:17.216
I don't want to lose heart!

1013
02:14:21.220 --> 02:14:24.765
I want to believe, as he does.

1014
02:14:31.814 --> 02:14:34.650
I will never be on the wrong side again.

1015
02:15:24.325 --> 02:15:26.327
No, please!

1016
02:15:52.061 --> 02:15:53.729
There he is! After him!

1017
02:16:23.050 --> 02:16:26.261
Lord Craig, is it true about Mornay?

1018
02:16:26.345 --> 02:16:27.471
Aye.

1019
02:16:28.764 --> 02:16:31.475
Wallace rode into his bedchamber
and killed him.

1020
02:16:31.558 --> 02:16:34.561
More a liability now than ever he was.

1021
02:16:34.603 --> 02:16:37.439
And there's no telling who'll be next.

1022
02:16:39.483 --> 02:16:41.110
Maybe you.

1023
02:16:43.237 --> 02:16:44.822
Maybe me.

1024
02:16:50.244 --> 02:16:52.121
It doesn't matter.

1025
02:16:53.914 --> 02:16:56.917
-I'm serious, Robert.
-So am I!

1026
02:17:10.139 --> 02:17:12.307
Christ! Shit!

1027
02:17:12.391 --> 02:17:15.144
Search the place!

1028
02:17:17.479 --> 02:17:18.647
Lochlan.

1029
02:17:25.320 --> 02:17:28.157
William Wallace killed 50 men.

1030
02:17:28.907 --> 02:17:30.826
Fifty if it was one.

1031
02:17:30.909 --> 02:17:34.246
A hundred men with his own sword.

1032
02:17:34.329 --> 02:17:35.831
Cut through them like...

1033
02:17:35.914 --> 02:17:39.168
Moses through the Red Sea.

1034
02:18:11.241 --> 02:18:15.287
His legend grows.
It will be worse than before.

1035
02:18:15.370 --> 02:18:18.624
He rallies new volunteers
in every Scottish town,

1036
02:18:19.792 --> 02:18:21.084
and when he replenishes his numbers...

1037
02:18:21.168 --> 02:18:23.796
They're sheep, mere sheep!

1038
02:18:26.298 --> 02:18:29.426
Easily dispersed
if we strike the shepherd.

1039
02:18:29.885 --> 02:18:31.345
Very well.

1040
02:18:32.221 --> 02:18:36.725
Pick a flock of your finest assassins
and set a meeting.

1041
02:18:36.809 --> 02:18:40.813
Milord, Wallace is renowned
for his ability to smell an ambush.

1042
02:18:44.566 --> 02:18:48.403
If what Lord Hamilton tells me
is correct,

1043
02:18:48.737 --> 02:18:52.282
he warmed to our future queen
and would trust her.

1044
02:18:53.951 --> 02:18:57.621
So we'll dispatch her with the notion
that she comes in peace.

1045
02:18:57.704 --> 02:19:00.582
Milord,
the princess might be taken hostage

1046
02:19:00.624 --> 02:19:02.709
or her life be put in jeopardy.

1047
02:19:02.751 --> 02:19:06.380
My son would be
most distressed by that.

1048
02:19:07.422 --> 02:19:10.551
But in truth, if she were to be killed,

1049
02:19:11.176 --> 02:19:15.931
we would soon find the king of France
a useful ally against the Scots.

1050
02:19:18.433 --> 02:19:21.812
You see, as king,

1051
02:19:21.895 --> 02:19:25.065
you must find the good in any situation.

1052
02:19:52.009 --> 02:19:54.428
It's William Wallace, sure.

1053
02:19:55.220 --> 02:19:58.098
He's given up his sword.

1054
02:19:58.140 --> 02:19:59.766
Be ready.

1055
02:21:38.699 --> 02:21:40.200
Milady,

1056
02:21:44.079 --> 02:21:46.164
I received your message.

1057
02:21:58.885 --> 02:22:03.140
This is the second time
you have warned me of danger.

1058
02:22:05.434 --> 02:22:06.852
Why?

1059
02:22:07.519 --> 02:22:09.104
There will be a new shipment
of supplies

1060
02:22:09.146 --> 02:22:12.274
coming north next month.
Foods and weapons. They won't...

1061
02:22:12.941 --> 02:22:14.276
No, stop.

1062
02:22:16.611 --> 02:22:18.405
Why do you help me?

1063
02:22:24.828 --> 02:22:26.663
Why do you help me?

1064
02:22:27.914 --> 02:22:31.126
Because of the way
you are looking at me now.

1065
02:24:23.321 --> 02:24:28.869
Just when we thought all hope was lost,
our noble saviors have arrived.

1066
02:24:31.580 --> 02:24:34.082
Off with their hoods.

1067
02:24:38.253 --> 02:24:41.006
Sir William,
we've come to seek a meeting.

1068
02:24:41.590 --> 02:24:44.259
Well, what's the point?

1069
02:24:44.301 --> 02:24:46.636
You've all sworn loyalty to Longshanks.

1070
02:24:46.720 --> 02:24:49.097
An oath to a liar is no oath at all.

1071
02:24:49.139 --> 02:24:51.766
Every man of us is ready
to swear loyalty to you.

1072
02:24:51.850 --> 02:24:54.311
So let the council swear publicly.

1073
02:24:54.394 --> 02:24:57.772
We cannot.
Some scarcely believe you're alive.

1074
02:24:57.856 --> 02:25:00.942
Others think you'll pay them
Mornay's wages.

1075
02:25:00.984 --> 02:25:02.736
So we bid you to Edinburgh.

1076
02:25:02.777 --> 02:25:03.778
Meet us two days from now.

1077
02:25:03.862 --> 02:25:06.448
Pledge us your pardon,
and we'll unite behind you.

1078
02:25:06.531 --> 02:25:07.699
Scotland will be one.

1079
02:25:07.782 --> 02:25:11.578
-One? You mean us and you.
-No.

1080
02:25:13.288 --> 02:25:15.123
I mean this.

1081
02:25:17.125 --> 02:25:19.711
It's the pledge of Robert the Bruce.

1082
02:25:29.137 --> 02:25:31.681
You do know it's a trap. Tell him.

1083
02:25:31.806 --> 02:25:35.477
I think if the Bruce wanted to kill you,
he'd have done it already at Falkirk.

1084
02:25:35.518 --> 02:25:38.230
-Aye.
-I know. I saw.

1085
02:25:38.313 --> 02:25:41.066
Leaving him aside,
what about the others?

1086
02:25:41.524 --> 02:25:43.485
Nest of scheming bastards!

1087
02:25:43.526 --> 02:25:45.487
They couldn't even agree
on the color of shite!

1088
02:25:45.570 --> 02:25:46.988
It's a trap. Are you blind?

1089
02:25:47.030 --> 02:25:48.406
Look at us.

1090
02:25:49.908 --> 02:25:53.328
We've got to try. We can't do this alone.

1091
02:25:54.162 --> 02:25:56.748
Joining the nobles is the only hope
for our people.

1092
02:25:56.831 --> 02:25:58.333
You know what happens
if we don't take that chance?

1093
02:25:58.375 --> 02:25:59.501
What?

1094
02:26:00.168 --> 02:26:01.461
Nothing.

1095
02:26:03.296 --> 02:26:05.423
I don't want to be a martyr.

1096
02:26:05.882 --> 02:26:07.842
Nor I. I want to live.

1097
02:26:09.094 --> 02:26:11.888
I want a home and children and peace.

1098
02:26:11.972 --> 02:26:13.848
-Do you?
-Aye, I do.

1099
02:26:13.932 --> 02:26:16.226
I've asked God for those things.

1100
02:26:16.851 --> 02:26:18.687
It's all for nothing
if you don't have freedom.

1101
02:26:18.770 --> 02:26:21.690
-That's just a dream, William.
-A dream? Just a...

1102
02:26:23.149 --> 02:26:27.028
Then what have we been doing
all this time?

1103
02:26:27.487 --> 02:26:29.114
We've lived that dream.

1104
02:26:29.197 --> 02:26:32.867
Your dream isn't about freedom.
It's about Murron.

1105
02:26:32.951 --> 02:26:35.870
You're doing this to be a hero
'cause you think she sees you.

1106
02:26:35.954 --> 02:26:38.873
I don't think she sees me.
I know she does.

1107
02:26:39.708 --> 02:26:42.043
And your father sees you, too.

1108
02:26:51.928 --> 02:26:53.096
Jesus.

1109
02:26:55.390 --> 02:26:57.559
Get up. Give us your hand.

1110
02:27:00.895 --> 02:27:02.772
Shall I come with you?

1111
02:27:04.024 --> 02:27:06.401
No. I'll go alone.

1112
02:27:08.445 --> 02:27:10.196
I'll see you after.

1113
02:27:11.072 --> 02:27:12.240
Right.

1114
02:27:16.619 --> 02:27:19.122
Sooner rather than later, I hope.

1115
02:27:25.462 --> 02:27:27.756
-He won't come.
-He will.

1116
02:27:28.923 --> 02:27:30.508
I know he will.

1117
02:27:44.647 --> 02:27:46.524
Milord, he approaches!

1118
02:28:30.443 --> 02:28:32.195
No!

1119
02:28:36.825 --> 02:28:38.785
Stay out of it, Robert!

1120
02:28:40.912 --> 02:28:42.747
You lied ! You lied!

1121
02:28:46.126 --> 02:28:49.504
Bruce is not to be hurt!
That's the arrangement!

1122
02:28:57.303 --> 02:28:58.930
Father!

1123
02:29:04.936 --> 02:29:07.814
You rotting bastard!

1124
02:29:08.356 --> 02:29:10.316
Why? Why?

1125
02:29:14.988 --> 02:29:17.824
Longshanks required Wallace.

1126
02:29:18.324 --> 02:29:20.034
So did our nobles.

1127
02:29:20.618 --> 02:29:23.705
That was the price of your crown.

1128
02:29:23.746 --> 02:29:24.873
Die!

1129
02:29:26.624 --> 02:29:28.418
I want you to die!

1130
02:29:28.501 --> 02:29:32.881
Soon enough, I'll be dead
and you'll be king.

1131
02:29:32.964 --> 02:29:35.300
I don't want anything from you.

1132
02:29:35.842 --> 02:29:37.469
You're not a man!

1133
02:29:38.303 --> 02:29:40.388
And you're not my father.

1134
02:29:44.434 --> 02:29:49.105
You're my son,
and you have always known my mind.

1135
02:29:51.191 --> 02:29:52.484
You deceived me.

1136
02:29:52.567 --> 02:29:55.069
You let yourself be deceived.

1137
02:29:55.153 --> 02:29:58.698
In your heart, you always knew
what had to happen here.

1138
02:30:02.243 --> 02:30:05.872
At last, you know what it means to hate.

1139
02:30:10.251 --> 02:30:12.504
Now you're ready to be a king.

1140
02:30:14.422 --> 02:30:18.551
My hate will die with you.

1141
02:30:23.765 --> 02:30:25.517
William Wallace,

1142
02:30:25.600 --> 02:30:28.311
you stand in taint of high treason.

1143
02:30:29.312 --> 02:30:30.605
Against whom?

1144
02:30:30.647 --> 02:30:32.357
Against your king.

1145
02:30:33.775 --> 02:30:35.777
Have you anything to say?

1146
02:30:36.694 --> 02:30:38.738
Never in my whole life

1147
02:30:40.406 --> 02:30:42.700
did I swear allegiance to him.

1148
02:30:43.952 --> 02:30:46.829
It matters not. He is your king.

1149
02:30:49.707 --> 02:30:52.627
Confess, and you may
receive a quick death.

1150
02:30:53.586 --> 02:30:56.339
Deny, and you must be purified by pain.

1151
02:30:56.422 --> 02:30:58.007
Do you confess?

1152
02:31:00.301 --> 02:31:03.388
Do you confess?

1153
02:31:09.269 --> 02:31:12.814
Then on the morrow,
you shall receive your purification.

1154
02:31:24.993 --> 02:31:26.703
-Your Highness.
-I will see the prisoner.

1155
02:31:26.786 --> 02:31:28.162
We've got orders
from the king that nobody...

1156
02:31:28.204 --> 02:31:30.582
The king will be dead in a month
and his son is a weakling.

1157
02:31:30.665 --> 02:31:33.167
Who do you think
will rule this kingdom?

1158
02:31:33.209 --> 02:31:35.003
Now open this door.

1159
02:31:36.963 --> 02:31:38.256
Majesty.

1160
02:31:44.929 --> 02:31:46.973
Come on, filth. Up on your feet.

1161
02:31:47.015 --> 02:31:48.433
Stop it!

1162
02:31:49.267 --> 02:31:50.602
Leave me.

1163
02:31:51.477 --> 02:31:53.146
I said leave me!

1164
02:32:06.242 --> 02:32:07.577
Milady.

1165
02:32:08.745 --> 02:32:13.082
Sir, I come to beg you

1166
02:32:15.126 --> 02:32:17.587
to confess all
and swear allegiance to the king

1167
02:32:17.670 --> 02:32:19.881
that he might show you mercy.

1168
02:32:20.757 --> 02:32:23.217
Will he show mercy to my country?

1169
02:32:24.010 --> 02:32:28.348
Mercy is to die quickly,
perhaps even live in a tower.

1170
02:32:28.389 --> 02:32:30.892
In time, who knows what can happen

1171
02:32:32.518 --> 02:32:34.729
if you can only live.

1172
02:32:39.192 --> 02:32:41.027
If I swear to him,

1173
02:32:41.819 --> 02:32:44.989
then all that I am is dead already.

1174
02:32:54.415 --> 02:32:57.001
You will die. It will be awful.

1175
02:32:57.085 --> 02:32:59.087
Every man dies.

1176
02:33:01.756 --> 02:33:03.883
Not every man really lives.

1177
02:33:10.181 --> 02:33:11.724
Drink this.

1178
02:33:13.059 --> 02:33:15.269
It will dull your pain.

1179
02:33:15.353 --> 02:33:19.232
No. It will numb my wits,
and I must have them all.

1180
02:33:20.483 --> 02:33:22.777
For if I'm senseless, or if I wail,

1181
02:33:23.277 --> 02:33:25.988
then Longshanks will have broken me.

1182
02:33:26.072 --> 02:33:28.950
I can't bear the thought of your torture.

1183
02:33:29.492 --> 02:33:30.785
Take it.

1184
02:33:35.623 --> 02:33:37.291
All right.

1185
02:34:24.672 --> 02:34:29.177
I have come to beg for the life
of William Wallace.

1186
02:34:31.471 --> 02:34:33.931
You're quite taken with him, aren't you?

1187
02:34:34.432 --> 02:34:36.100
I respect him.

1188
02:34:37.769 --> 02:34:39.562
At worst, he was a worthy enemy.

1189
02:34:39.645 --> 02:34:44.484
Show mercy, O thou great king,
and win the respect of your own people.

1190
02:34:54.118 --> 02:34:59.040
Even now, you are incapable of mercy.

1191
02:35:05.838 --> 02:35:07.340
And you...

1192
02:35:11.511 --> 02:35:14.639
To you,
that word is as unfamiliar as love.

1193
02:35:15.348 --> 02:35:19.769
Before he lost his powers of speech,
he told me his one comfort was

1194
02:35:19.852 --> 02:35:22.939
that he would live
to know Wallace was dead.

1195
02:35:41.290 --> 02:35:42.708
You see,

1196
02:35:44.627 --> 02:35:47.129
death comes to us all.

1197
02:35:56.556 --> 02:36:02.061
But before it comes to you, know this.

1198
02:36:02.103 --> 02:36:04.230
Your blood dies with you.

1199
02:36:06.899 --> 02:36:10.111
A child who is not of your line grows
in my belly.

1200
02:36:13.364 --> 02:36:17.076
Your son will not sit long on the throne,
I swear it.

1201
02:36:54.822 --> 02:36:56.824
I'm so afraid.

1202
02:37:04.832 --> 02:37:08.711
Give me the strength to die well.

1203
02:37:32.944 --> 02:37:34.654
Here he comes!

1204
02:39:03.659 --> 02:39:06.662
Now behold the awful price of treason!

1205
02:39:13.461 --> 02:39:15.796
You will fall to your knees now,

1206
02:39:17.715 --> 02:39:20.634
declare yourself the king's loyal subject

1207
02:39:21.469 --> 02:39:23.471
and beg his mercy.

1208
02:39:30.478 --> 02:39:32.354
And you shall have it.

1209
02:39:43.824 --> 02:39:45.242
Rope!

1210
02:40:07.264 --> 02:40:08.724
Stretch him!

1211
02:40:11.018 --> 02:40:14.188
That's it! Stretch him!

1212
02:40:29.912 --> 02:40:31.831
Shame! Shame!

1213
02:40:51.642 --> 02:40:53.853
Pleasant, yes?

1214
02:40:56.897 --> 02:40:58.816
Rise to your knees,

1215
02:40:58.899 --> 02:41:01.694
kiss the royal emblem on my cloak,

1216
02:41:01.735 --> 02:41:03.904
and you will feel no more.

1217
02:41:45.529 --> 02:41:46.864
Rack him!

1218
02:42:41.377 --> 02:42:42.878
Enough?

1219
02:43:35.639 --> 02:43:39.059
It can all end right now.

1220
02:43:40.394 --> 02:43:41.937
Peace.

1221
02:43:43.188 --> 02:43:46.358
Please, just say it.

1222
02:43:47.443 --> 02:43:50.154
Cry out, "Mercy."

1223
02:44:00.831 --> 02:44:02.291
Mercy!

1224
02:44:02.374 --> 02:44:04.084
-Mercy!
-Mercy!

1225
02:44:04.209 --> 02:44:05.919
-Mercy!
-Mercy!

1226
02:44:09.882 --> 02:44:11.175
Cry out.

1227
02:44:11.550 --> 02:44:14.762
Mercy! Mercy!

1228
02:44:17.639 --> 02:44:19.224
Just say it.

1229
02:44:19.558 --> 02:44:22.144
Mercy.

1230
02:44:22.227 --> 02:44:25.439
Mercy! Mercy!

1231
02:44:44.583 --> 02:44:46.752
Mercy, William.

1232
02:44:46.794 --> 02:44:49.004
-Mercy.
-Jesus, now say it.

1233
02:44:55.135 --> 02:44:58.597
The prisoner wishes to say a word.

1234
02:44:59.014 --> 02:45:01.600
Mercy! Mercy!

1235
02:45:01.642 --> 02:45:03.644
Mercy!

1236
02:45:18.409 --> 02:45:25.416
Freedom!

1237
02:47:14.024 --> 02:47:16.443
<i>After the beheading,</i>

1238
02:47:16.485 --> 02:47:19.696
<i>William Wallace's body
was torn to pieces.</i>

1239
02:47:22.616 --> 02:47:25.577
<i>His head was set on London Bridge,</i>

1240
02:47:27.120 --> 02:47:32.709
<i>his arms and legs sent
to the four corners of Britain</i>

1241
02:47:32.793 --> 02:47:34.711
<i>as a warning.</i>

1242
02:47:34.795 --> 02:47:39.716
<i>It did not have the effect
that Longshanks planned.</i>

1243
02:47:40.551 --> 02:47:43.679
<i>And I, Robert the Bruce,</i>

1244
02:47:43.762 --> 02:47:48.809
<i>rode out to pay homage
to the armies of the English king</i>

1245
02:47:48.850 --> 02:47:52.145
<i>and accept his endorsement
of my crown.</i>

1246
02:47:52.938 --> 02:47:55.649
I hope you've washed your arse
this morning.

1247
02:47:55.732 --> 02:47:58.193
It's about to be kissed by a king.

1248
02:48:27.472 --> 02:48:29.891
Come. Let's get it over with.

1249
02:48:42.362 --> 02:48:43.488
Stop!

1250
02:49:01.715 --> 02:49:03.884
You have bled with Wallace!

1251
02:49:09.848 --> 02:49:11.558
Now bleed with me.

1252
02:49:52.516 --> 02:49:54.768
Wallace! Wallace!

1253
02:49:54.851 --> 02:49:57.437
-Wallace! Wallace!
-Wallace! Wallace!

1254
02:49:57.479 --> 02:50:00.023
-Wallace! Wallace!
-Wallace! Wallace!

1255
02:50:18.959 --> 02:50:21.712
<i>In the year of our Lord, 1314,</i>

1256
02:50:22.921 --> 02:50:26.299
<i>patriots of Scotland,
starving and outnumbered,</i>

1257
02:50:26.675 --> 02:50:30.137
<i>charged the fields of Bannockburn.</i>

1258
02:50:30.178 --> 02:50:33.140
<i>They fought like warrior poets.</i>

1259
02:50:33.223 --> 02:50:35.308
<i>They fought like Scotsmen,</i>

1260
02:50:36.435 --> 02:50:38.311
<i>and won their freedom.</i>
