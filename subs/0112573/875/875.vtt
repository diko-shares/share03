1
00:00:09,065 --> 00:00:09,872
My name is Bradley Cohen,

2
00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:13,593
But when I was a kid,
people called me by lots of names.

3
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:17,680
My brother Jeff called me Dr Bobo

4
00:00:19,954 --> 00:00:22,227
My mom called me... honey

5
00:00:26,034 --> 00:00:30,434
And the kids at school... well, they called me everything,
from spas to freak

6
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:33,932
I didn't have many friends, actually

7
00:00:34,209 --> 00:00:35,797
But I did have a constant companion

8
00:00:36,178 --> 00:00:38,827
I can barely remember  the time it wasn't there

9
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:46,803
Now, sometimes it wasn't a problem for me

10
00:00:54,856 --> 00:00:56,936
Other times...it was

11
00:00:59,113 --> 00:01:02,637
Chrop-chopp -  Chrop boy!  Scared, Brad?
Stop it!

12
00:01:03,921 --> 00:01:04,885
Throw!

13
00:01:11,474 --> 00:01:13,907
What is going on?Come on, bring it on!

14
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:17,350
Stop that fighting right now! come on! Get back to class!

15
00:01:18,638 --> 00:01:21,683
Chrop-chop! Stop that nonsense! Wap-wap..You are in big trouble, mister

16
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:26,708
The girl fell in the mud and got dirty

17
00:01:27,334 --> 00:01:31,501
One thing my constant companion and I agreed on was that we hated school.

18
00:01:32,806 --> 00:01:34,530
I couldn't wait till I got out.

19
00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:40,128
No more homework, no more books, no more teachers' dirty looks.

20
00:01:41,077 --> 00:01:44,821
wa-wa-quap (everybody laughing)

21
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:50,438
My companion first showed up when I was six

22
00:01:50,981 --> 00:01:52,653
but it was years before it had a name

23
00:01:53,469 --> 00:01:55,044
Now, the shrink said I was just hyper.

24
00:01:55,436 --> 00:01:58,080
I made funny noises and acted weird to draw attention to myself.

25
00:01:59,108 --> 00:02:00,372
It was just a face.

26
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,825
I'd grow out of it and be normal

27
00:02:04,483 --> 00:02:06,141
like everybody else.

28
00:02:07,525 --> 00:02:09,682
Wop-wop!

29
00:02:12,182 --> 00:02:14,365
Through it all, my constant companion stuck with me.

30
00:02:15,764 --> 00:02:16,869
Now, to my friends

31
00:02:17,205 --> 00:02:19,083
I'm just regular old Brad

32
00:02:19,118 --> 00:02:21,236
The guy who likes baseball

33
00:02:21,653 --> 00:02:23,462
And who loves cheesy 80's music

34
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,451
Which they think is much weirder

35
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,423
than the noises I make.

36
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:28,252
Pa-pa-pa-pa-baby

37
00:02:30,877 --> 00:02:31,377
Don't forget my number

38
00:02:31,412 --> 00:02:31,426
baby

39
00:03:11,116 --> 00:03:12,985
Afternoon, officer. Was I speeding?

40
00:03:12,948 --> 00:03:13,891
12 miles over the limit.

41
00:03:15,524 --> 00:03:16,347
St. Luis, ha? You're a tourist?

42
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:20,860
No. I live in Atlanta now. I just moved here.
I

43
00:03:21,747 --> 00:03:22,667
I guess I was a little distracted.

44
00:03:26,155 --> 00:03:26,779
Sir, 've you been drinking?

45
00:03:28,043 --> 00:03:30,275
No...no sir, I have a Tourette syndrome

46
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:33,242
Take it easy, son

47
00:03:34,186 --> 00:03:34,947
I'm gonna need you to sign

48
00:03:36,711 --> 00:03:37,739
So, what kind of job are you looking ofr?

49
00:03:38,923 --> 00:03:40,492
Teaching. I'm gonna be a teacher

50
00:03:46,347 --> 00:03:47,635
Aha. I get this look a lot

51
00:03:50,547 --> 00:03:51,587
But I never let it get to me.

52
00:04:10,827 --> 00:04:12,178
I see you have a BA from Bradley university

53
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,962
That's in Illinois, isn't it? - Yes, ma'm.

54
00:04:16,466 --> 00:04:18,746
Graduated cumma laude. High recommendations

55
00:04:20,714 --> 00:04:24,588
Your student teaching evales are outstanding. Excellent.

56
00:04:25,962 --> 00:04:27,834
What made you decide to go into teaching?

57
00:04:29,371 --> 00:04:31,907
It's all I ever wanted to do. I feel like I was born to teach. Wop!

58
00:04:33,702 --> 00:04:36,275
Why choose Atlanta? I mean - Missuori is your home

59
00:04:37,092 --> 00:04:39,043
Yeah...No, I'm thinking of becoming a Brave's fan

60
00:04:40,116 --> 00:04:43,787
So I...Jeorge  is my Iliinois teaching certificate

61
00:04:45,276 --> 00:04:48,347
Plus, I fell in love with Atlanta when I worked down here as a camp counselor

62
00:04:49,204 --> 00:04:50,028
I live here now

63
00:04:50,931 --> 00:04:52,699
So does my dad and my step-mom.

64
00:04:56,052 --> 00:04:59,018
Well, it's nice to have family here to give you support.

65
00:05:02,547 --> 00:05:04,011
Maybe we should talk about the elephant?

66
00:05:05,404 --> 00:05:07,114
Elephant? - In the room.  My tourettes.

67
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,868
No, the Americans with Disabilities Act doesn't allow me to ask.. - I know

68
00:05:12,749 --> 00:05:14,284
But I would like to tell you.

69
00:05:15,012 --> 00:05:16,349
Just like I tell the kids in my classes.

70
00:05:16,796 --> 00:05:18,651
See, I explain it to them that it's a brain thing

71
00:05:19,508 --> 00:05:20,580
That causes me to make these strange noises

72
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,067
They are like sneezes.

73
00:05:22,844 --> 00:05:25,125
Irrepressible. When you have to - you have to.

74
00:05:26,027 --> 00:05:26,811
HOw do they react?

75
00:05:27,733 --> 00:05:28,565
Once they understand, they are fine with it.

76
00:05:29,661 --> 00:05:30,453
It's never caused a problem in the classroom.

77
00:05:33,293 --> 00:05:34,300
All I want is a chance.

78
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:37,710
Just get me the interviews and let me prove to them that I can do the job.

79
00:05:39,581 --> 00:05:43,300
The Americans with Disabilities Act says I'm entitled to a chance.

80
00:05:50,724 --> 00:05:52,550
Ron! - How did it go?

81
00:05:53,957 --> 00:05:55,878
Err..you know... Who wants a teacher who barks like a dog?

82
00:05:57,293 --> 00:05:58,440
You should try another line of work.

83
00:05:59,582 --> 00:06:00,318
Are you serious?

84
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,150
Didn't they look at your resume?

85
00:06:05,013 --> 00:06:06,901
Ah! you're kidding me!

86
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,062
They are setting up some interviews with some principals.

87
00:06:10,445 --> 00:06:11,404
Fantastic! When?

88
00:06:12,365 --> 00:06:13,333
I don't know, I gotta wait for their calls.

89
00:06:13,908 --> 00:06:15,021
Get changed, we 're gonna go celebrate.

90
00:06:15,837 --> 00:06:16,349
Haven't you got a date?

91
00:06:17,037 --> 00:06:17,646
Elis, see if she's got a friend.

92
00:06:18,547 --> 00:06:19,723
It's about time you started meeting some chicks

93
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:21,962
I can't focus on dating right now.

94
00:06:22,787 --> 00:06:24,691
Has anybody ever told you that you 're obsessive?

95
00:06:25,794 --> 00:06:27,595
...Only every shrink I ever saw.

96
00:06:28,906 --> 00:06:30,802
Well, have fun focusing.

97
00:06:32,802 --> 00:06:35,578
Oh, your Dad called againg.

98
00:06:36,626 --> 00:06:39,753
Maybe you should call him back. You know?

99
00:06:41,354 --> 00:06:42,801
I'll see you later.

100
00:06:45,609 --> 00:06:48,642
Returning Dad's call?I'd have to prepare for that.

101
00:06:50,431 --> 00:06:52,617
See, Mom and Dad had divorced when I was a little kid

102
00:06:53,384 --> 00:06:56,505
and my relashionship with Dad had always been...

103
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,488
Let's just say...complicated.

104
00:07:02,072 --> 00:07:05,272
I mean, I wore out his patience like nails on a chalkboard.

105
00:07:07,848 --> 00:07:11,208
It didn't help that my brother Jeff was also a little hyper

106
00:07:12,152 --> 00:07:16,065
Dad said he is waiting to get back to his room in Atlanta. He is waiting to say good-bye. - Bye!

107
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,936
You 're gonna make him mad! - Shut up!

108
00:07:19,735 --> 00:07:20,687
Come on, I'll race ya!

109
00:07:21,536 --> 00:07:22,824
Git's the green dragon, ya gotta be kidding!

110
00:07:23,687 --> 00:07:24,854
Sucker! - Cheater!

111
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:47,306
See you, Jeff! - That's not fair!

112
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:53,955
Oh, come on! You're not gonna beat me!

113
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:58,714
Oh, that's not fair! You gotta fight!

114
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:04,713
Quiet down, guys, quiet down! We do have neighbours, you know!

115
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,561
Come here! - You see, I did beat you!

116
00:08:08,337 --> 00:08:10,249
Yeah. Calm down. Brad, come here. Come on, honey, focus, will you?

117
00:08:11,329 --> 00:08:14,241
Come here. Come here, stand here. Listen, listen up. Focus, please

118
00:08:15,081 --> 00:08:19,338
All right? I need you guys to do me a favor. I want you both to make life a little easier for your mom, ok?

119
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:23,697
You are driving her nuts! Guys, listen..Hey, hey, stop it!

120
00:08:24,393 --> 00:08:28,705
Brad! Help her out around the house, but most of all let us - stop the obnoxious behavior!

121
00:08:30,573 --> 00:08:33,212
Hey, listen! I mean it! Ok?

122
00:08:33,822 --> 00:08:35,670
Quit the clowing! Your brother may think it's funny but I don't.

123
00:08:36,372 --> 00:08:39,517
I can't help it! -Yes you can, there is nothing wrong with you, it's a little self-control wouldn't fix.

124
00:08:40,341 --> 00:08:41,269
Now, stop it!

125
00:08:41,917 --> 00:08:44,884
Norman? - Yeah! - They are not gonna hold that plane for you.

126
00:08:46,173 --> 00:08:47,036
Ok, all right! Ok, give me a hug.

127
00:08:51,596 --> 00:08:52,596
See you, Dad! - bye-bye, J-man!

128
00:08:57,756 --> 00:09:00,301
I love you, Dad! - I love you too, kiddo.

129
00:09:01,476 --> 00:09:03,644
And listen up - we'll stay in my house next time, ok?

130
00:09:04,652 --> 00:09:05,892
I'll get tickets to a Brave's game.

131
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:13,236
And Brad? Remember, what we talked about? Self control, all right? ok?

132
00:09:15,235 --> 00:09:18,699
You need any help with anything, Ma? - Well, now that you mention it..

133
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:35,812
After the divorce, Jeff and I helped Mom with her new business. Sort of a high-class traveling botique.

134
00:09:36,308 --> 00:09:40,027
Well, maybe "helped" isn't exactly the right word.

135
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:46,907
Oh, Ellen, these things are exquisite. You'd never find styles like these in St. Louis.

136
00:09:47,531 --> 00:09:51,404
It was direct from California. Beverly Hills. This is what everybody is wearing.

137
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:55,287
Look at this...Boys! boys! - Hide-and-seek?

138
00:09:56,004 --> 00:09:59,147
You count! one. two...
Now, Ellen, I don't wanna see anything in double digits.

139
00:09:59,675 --> 00:10:02,923
Honey, everything in California runs small. Go ahead, just try it on!

140
00:10:03,619 --> 00:10:07,772
Wha-whap! whap! - Brad, would you please calm down.

141
00:10:08,562 --> 00:10:11,099
He is barking like a dog, for Goodness sake!

142
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:20,027
Now look. Don't take this a wrong way, you know I wouldn't say this to you, if we weren't friends.
But have you considered an exorcist?

143
00:10:23,563 --> 00:10:26,883
You know, I think you might face the fact that you are size 12.

144
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:30,763
I can cut the label out to make you feel better.

145
00:10:37,247 --> 00:10:39,494
It's a new doctor, let's listen to what he has to say.

146
00:10:40,414 --> 00:10:42,504
I know what he has to say...

147
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:50,535
Do you feel any anger toward your mother, because of the divorce?

148
00:10:51,407 --> 00:10:53,647
Wha..No. No.

149
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:58,326
You resent your father becaus he doesn't live with you anymore?

150
00:10:59,127 --> 00:11:00,302
No

151
00:11:01,822 --> 00:11:04,021
Do you blame yourself for the divorce, Brad?

152
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:09,719
It happened when I was a little kid. I hardly even remember.

153
00:11:11,676 --> 00:11:16,940
Mrs. Cohen, Brad has some serious denial issues regarding the divorce. What he needs at home

154
00:11:17,988 --> 00:11:22,500
are some clear boundaries. He needs to understand that this behavior is totally unacceptable

155
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,524
and that, Mrs Cohen, is your job.

156
00:11:26,357 --> 00:11:28,708
The hardest part was knowing how tough I made things for Mom.

157
00:11:29,692 --> 00:11:33,349
I tried as best as I could for her. -Make sure he keeps taking his medication, yeah?

158
00:11:33,917 --> 00:11:38,861
And for Dad ...I played sports.

159
00:11:41,227 --> 00:11:43,237
On the ball field I fit right in.

160
00:11:43,853 --> 00:11:48,038
I mean, everybody makes funny noises and has strange tics at the baseball game.

161
00:11:50,037 --> 00:11:56,101
Go on, bobo! Get him in, Brad, get him in!

162
00:12:21,596 --> 00:12:23,844
Thank you very much.  - Ok, what can I get you?

163
00:12:24,507 --> 00:12:27,268
Hey, guys! I've got something pretty exiting to tell you!

164
00:12:28,196 --> 00:12:30,235
Honey, don't eat so fast, you gonna get the hiccups.

165
00:12:31,043 --> 00:12:33,779
He's always got the hiccups. - You're a hiccup, j-juch!

166
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:38,371
Listen, would you just relax? Mom says you're not taking your meds.

167
00:12:39,267 --> 00:12:43,132
How are you ever gonna calm down if you don't do what the doctor tells you to do?

168
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:48,220
Pills just make it worse. - Oh, I see, so you're a doctor now, too, heh? He's Doctor Bobo! - Shut up!

169
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:52,707
All right guys, listen, guys. I have a very important announcement to make.

170
00:12:53,595 --> 00:12:57,043
Guys? GUYS?? All right, that's it, we 're going back to the car. Come on.

171
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:03,235
I'm still hungry. - You know what 'd be nice? One day! without you acting up.

172
00:13:04,819 --> 00:13:07,715
One!

173
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:31,854
So, what's the announcement, Dad?

174
00:13:32,623 --> 00:13:34,134
I've been seeing somebody.

175
00:13:34,871 --> 00:13:36,182
What do you mean - seeing somebody?

176
00:13:36,773 --> 00:13:41,078
Her name is Dianne, and she ...Brad, please! Stop doing that!

177
00:13:41,648 --> 00:13:42,591
I can't.

178
00:13:45,046 --> 00:13:49,607
I mean, nothing has happened yet, but how'd you guys feel about having a step-mom?

179
00:13:50,231 --> 00:13:52,054
No way!

180
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:55,470
We've already got a Mom. - Well, now you're gonna have two.

181
00:13:56,687 --> 00:13:59,823
I've talked to your mom about it, and she is fine with it.

182
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,046
She said...I said, STOP IT! STOP IT!

183
00:14:06,728 --> 00:14:12,270
You see, I couldn't really blame Dad for losing it. My tics drove him nuts.

184
00:14:13,094 --> 00:14:20,629
Because, like my teachers, he had no name for my strange behavior. Except - insufferable.

185
00:14:22,108 --> 00:14:25,730
Now, somehow - I don't know how - I made OK grades.

186
00:14:26,467 --> 00:14:29,890
But what would take a normal person an hour, took me two or three.

187
00:14:30,507 --> 00:14:33,548
I mean - I love learning. but I hated, HATED reading!

188
00:14:34,235 --> 00:14:37,754
Trying to concentrate brought out the worst in my constant companion.

189
00:14:43,514 --> 00:14:46,610
Brad! Come up here, please.

190
00:14:59,921 --> 00:15:02,521
I know you think you are the class clown, but I've had it with you!

191
00:15:03,858 --> 00:15:10,240
I can't -wha--can't help it. - That's what you always say.  I don't wanna hear any more excuses.

192
00:15:11,153 --> 00:15:13,049
Your classmates are trying to study...

193
00:15:15,545 --> 00:15:19,066
And your clowing makes it impossible.

194
00:15:21,177 --> 00:15:25,008
I'm sorry. - Don't apologize to me. Apologize to them.

195
00:15:26,145 --> 00:15:31,424
Eyes up here, everyone. Sit up straight, please. Brad has something to say to you.

196
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:39,888
I'm sorry, I ...that you can't study because of me.

197
00:15:41,177 --> 00:15:47,849
And...You promise never to make any more silly noises ever again.

198
00:15:50,632 --> 00:15:57,056
Promise I won't make any more silly noises ever again

199
00:15:59,648 --> 00:16:03,144
Take your seat. All of you - back to your books!

200
00:16:12,962 --> 00:16:17,002
As difficult as this may be for you, Mrs Cohen, I assure you - the teachers are at their wits' end

201
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:23,337
I understand that, of course - No, this can be the last chance. I mean - THE very last chance

202
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:31,416
Brad! Look, I sent for your mother, because things have just gotten out of control here.

203
00:16:31,978 --> 00:16:34,529
Now, she's gonna take you home today...

204
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:38,754
You can come back...I can't help it. - Sorry, what did you say?

205
00:16:39,747 --> 00:16:42,178
He said, he can't help it. - Right.

206
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:44,458
What if he is telling the truth? Huh?

207
00:16:45,098 --> 00:16:47,553
You've got a bright boy, Mrs Cohen, but making excuses for him...

208
00:16:50,058 --> 00:16:52,097
Making excuses is not going to help.

209
00:16:52,939 --> 00:16:58,890
Now, he needs to use this time to ask himelf this question - Come on, Brad, let's go! - why am I sabotaging myself.

210
00:17:01,497 --> 00:17:04,033
I don't care if they expell me. I hate that school!

211
00:17:04,889 --> 00:17:05,897
Well, it's that school or another school...

212
00:17:07,121 --> 00:17:10,329
I hate all schools. Why are we going here? - To find some answers.

213
00:17:11,657 --> 00:17:15,713
I can't go in the library. They'll throw me out. Please, Mom...

214
00:17:17,058 --> 00:17:19,586
All right. Come here. Sit over here.

215
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:26,178
Well, maybe we're just going down the wrong track. - Who? - All of us.

216
00:17:31,705 --> 00:17:34,013
Get off me! -Djha-wah-wha -

217
00:17:37,861 --> 00:17:41,564
I know you're busy, Norman. I won't take up much of your time, but I really think you should hear this.

218
00:17:42,613 --> 00:17:46,830
Boys, keep it down, I'm talking to your Dad. - I wanna talk to him! - In a minute, keep it down!

219
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,646
Listen, you know those teachers and that doctor.

220
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,086
To them, it's all about bad parenting, which of course comes down to me, because I'm the only one here.

221
00:17:55,005 --> 00:17:59,094
No, I'm not blaming you, Norman. In fact, I'm gonna stop blaming myself.

222
00:17:59,941 --> 00:18:03,196
I was talking to a friend, and she thinks that the doctors are missing something.

223
00:18:03,876 --> 00:18:07,660
I got this stuff of medical books from the library and I've been doing a little bit of research

224
00:18:08,308 --> 00:18:11,492
Stop saying he just needs more discipline, Norman! Nothing I do, helps.

225
00:18:12,829 --> 00:18:15,435
He is out of control and I'm at the end of my rope.

226
00:18:17,732 --> 00:18:23,821
Can I talk to Dad? - Can you just wait a minute, honey?

227
00:18:24,741 --> 00:18:28,156
Mom! - All right, give him back to me when you're done. - What is it, Jeffrey?

228
00:18:29,813 --> 00:18:36,227
Hi Dad! No, it was a great game! I had two base hits in a walk.

229
00:18:49,241 --> 00:18:52,615
Sorry I cause you so much trouble, Mom!

230
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:59,840
I want you to read something in this book I found. It's a medical book that might explain why you make all those noises.

231
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:01,786
I can't read it, Mom. - Read.

232
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,991
Tourette syndrom.

233
00:19:08,983 --> 00:19:13,246
That's Brad, isn't it? The noises and the twitches

234
00:19:14,734 --> 00:19:21,086
I still need to do more tests, but... you could be right. We may've been headed out the wrong road here.

235
00:19:24,911 --> 00:19:29,455
I've never actually seen a case of Tourette's before.

236
00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:33,127
So at last, my constant companion had a name.

237
00:19:33,831 --> 00:19:37,879
This says there is no cure. But that may have changed, this is an old book.

238
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:40,583
That hasn't changed, Mrs Cohen.

239
00:19:42,366 --> 00:19:46,231
I'm very sorry. -Yeah, but they are still looking for a cure, right?

240
00:19:46,846 --> 00:19:51,632
I mean, they will find one, won't they? They have...have to...

241
00:19:54,613 --> 00:19:59,152
It's ok, Mom. We can do this, all right?

242
00:20:05,182 --> 00:20:09,695
See, there is a reason, Dad. I haven't been weird on purpose.

243
00:20:11,198 --> 00:20:14,455
Listen, Brad...I...

244
00:20:18,878 --> 00:20:23,133
Right. Well, that's all I wanted to say. Bye.

245
00:20:27,146 --> 00:20:36,233
Finally, my Dad believed me.But he never believed IN me.

246
00:20:37,123 --> 00:20:39,937
That I would succeed. That I could teach.

247
00:20:45,204 --> 00:20:47,977
Cha-Wap-wa..cha..Hello, this  is Brad.

248
00:20:48,794 --> 00:21:01,154
A dog? Yes. Yes, ma'm, that's my dog. Aha.Ok, yes. Yes, I can be there 11 a.m.

249
00:21:02,169 --> 00:21:06,673
My very first interview. - Great, that sounds great. Ok, thank you.

250
00:21:09,753 --> 00:21:14,099
I tried not to overreact. I held in my tics.

251
00:21:22,273 --> 00:21:26,785
After the first call, I got two more. Three interviews with three principals.

252
00:21:27,896 --> 00:21:33,153
Needless to say, my constant companion was more than a little enthusiastic.

253
00:21:40,001 --> 00:21:47,209
Well, I see you only have your Bachelor's degree. Are planning to get your Masters?

254
00:21:47,808 --> 00:21:48,968
Yes, sir. As soon as I can.

255
00:21:49,857 --> 00:21:53,887
We don't require for entry level..But if you're serious...- I'm very serious.

256
00:21:54,632 --> 00:21:56,200
I want to make teaching my life.

257
00:21:59,009 --> 00:22:07,751
I... I make these noises because I have a Tourette syndrome.
I'd like to tell you about it.

258
00:22:08,488 --> 00:22:12,127
It's a neurological disoreder, where my brain sends mixed signals to my body.

259
00:22:12,712 --> 00:22:14,247
It's like sneeze, it's irrepressible.

260
00:22:15,921 --> 00:22:18,655
Three weeks, and..to get off. -  Ok. Thanks very much. - Take care.

261
00:22:20,576 --> 00:22:25,504
Well, strike one. But, like Mom always said - don't ever give up.

262
00:22:29,487 --> 00:22:35,927
When I was little, Mom never stopped researching. Because, while there was no cure, there might be ways to live a normal life.

263
00:22:41,135 --> 00:22:48,375
It's a church, Mom. - Honey, you're not gonna have to get a Bible lesson. This is just a support group.

264
00:22:49,527 --> 00:22:54,775
Do I have to? - You need to connect with other people who have Tourette's.

265
00:22:56,111 --> 00:23:00,273
Let's find out how they live with it. Ok? Let's do it.

266
00:23:02,942 --> 00:23:06,031
I'm not going in there.

267
00:23:11,343 --> 00:23:15,599
I'd never seen anyone with Tourette's syndrome before.

268
00:23:17,566 --> 00:23:22,613
There were eye-blinkers and nose-twitchers, foot stampers and neck-jerkers.

269
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:28,454
Some of them yelped, coughed. Is this what I looked like to other people?

270
00:23:29,654 --> 00:23:33,574
Come on, Bobo. We are here to learn. Start learning.

271
00:23:35,542 --> 00:23:39,622
The Americans with Disabilities Act gives us the right to do anything or go any place we want to.

272
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:43,646
Try going to a movie. Or a concert, or a restaurant.

273
00:23:45,334 --> 00:23:47,783
All this doesn't mean anything when people yell at you to shut up.

274
00:23:48,246 --> 00:23:52,317
I come home, and my parents close the windows and blinds,' cause they don't want the neighbors to see me tick.

275
00:23:53,358 --> 00:23:54,310
No one was even trying to be accepted.

276
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,061
The adults were out of work, the kids stayed at home.

277
00:23:57,956 --> 00:24:01,803
I knew one thing: I didn't wanna be like them

278
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,005
Even the coach on his team won't accept him.

279
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:10,621
Oh, I had had it. Of course, you're homeschooling, too.

280
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:14,460
No, Brad goes to school, like any other kid.

281
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:19,227
These kids aren't like any other kids. School is a waste of time for them.

282
00:24:20,771 --> 00:24:22,955
I took him out of the third grade, just to save my sanity.

283
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:29,733
You want my advice? You'll do the same.

284
00:24:30,523 --> 00:24:32,259
Yeah. Thanks.

285
00:24:33,435 --> 00:24:35,604
Let's go, Bobo.

286
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:39,337
It's supposed to be a support group. Where is the support?

287
00:24:40,056 --> 00:24:41,665
Just hide away for the rest of your life?

288
00:24:42,521 --> 00:24:45,921
I'm really so sorry that I brought you there, honey. Let's just forget this.

289
00:24:46,601 --> 00:24:50,985
I don't wanna forget this, Mom. These people let Tourette's win. I'm never gonna do that.

290
00:24:51,889 --> 00:24:57,137
It's difficult to imagine that at the age of 12 I would find a genuine philosophy to live by.

291
00:24:58,185 --> 00:25:04,824
But here it was, this defining moment - to always face my adversity head on.

292
00:25:07,067 --> 00:25:10,082
When I went to my next interview, I decided to be even more upfront.

293
00:25:10,922 --> 00:25:14,354
Get the Tourette's staff out of the way first, and then dazzle them with my approach to teaching.

294
00:25:15,658 --> 00:25:17,834
You seem to have been very successful inspite of your Tourette's

295
00:25:18,128 --> 00:25:22,857
I worked very hard to become the best teacher I can be. - Thank you for coming in, I'll let you know. - Thanks.

296
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,544
So much for being upfront.

297
00:25:27,113 --> 00:25:30,793
For my third interview, I decided to avoid discussing my Tourette's at all.

298
00:25:32,249 --> 00:25:35,304
Each weak I like to send home a progess report to my students' parents

299
00:25:36,441 --> 00:25:42,033
I like to give my students a voice in learning, to be hands-on and interactive in the classroom

300
00:25:43,617 --> 00:25:46,639
But also to keep the parents closely involved.

301
00:25:50,596 --> 00:25:53,067
Ron, it was a huge mistake not mentioning my Tourette's

302
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:57,877
It was like...you know...I was trying to hide it. - Fat chance!

303
00:25:59,012 --> 00:26:01,604
Ok. that's the negative. - No the negative is you gotta stop stressing out.

304
00:26:02,613 --> 00:26:07,500
You're stressing me out. -  But the positive is that - hey, the agency had no problem with it, right?

305
00:26:08,557 --> 00:26:10,276
I just...I got to wait for the call.

306
00:26:11,405 --> 00:26:12,964
The positive is: you're coming out with me.

307
00:26:13,637 --> 00:26:17,787
My new girl friend, she has a roommate. - Will you stop trying to set me up?

308
00:26:18,788 --> 00:26:20,908
When I'm ready to date, I'll date.

309
00:26:21,652 --> 00:26:24,285
Come on, she's heard all about you, and she still wants to meet you.

310
00:26:25,051 --> 00:26:26,588
Oh, thanks. Real kind!

311
00:26:27,356 --> 00:26:32,597
Listen, I wanna relax, ok? I wanna watch the Braves. - We all wanna watch the Braves. Get changed!

312
00:26:35,789 --> 00:26:39,173
Ron tells me you are on a big job-hunt. How is it going?

313
00:26:39,821 --> 00:26:42,532
Pretty good. Except no one has hired me yet.

314
00:26:43,421 --> 00:26:45,036
I guess they are all too busy fighting to get to me.

315
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:55,708
You do this? - Yeah. - I'm impressed by this.
You should be. - I was not expecting this.

316
00:26:57,269 --> 00:26:59,317
That's amazing! - But I'm pretty good. - You are.

317
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,484
So, you are really a sports-fan. - Yes, big time.

318
00:27:05,318 --> 00:27:11,253
Soccer, softball, tennis. I played a lot in college, but not good enough for the pros.

319
00:27:11,917 --> 00:27:16,716
I hear that because I wish I was good enough to be him. - Who? - Him.

320
00:27:17,356 --> 00:27:21,707
Oh, you wanna be a mascot.

321
00:27:22,436 --> 00:27:25,851
His name is Homer. And it's a life-long ambition.

322
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:35,588
Don't look now. - Ok. - Don't look now. There is this guy behind us, and I don't know what his problem is.

323
00:27:36,468 --> 00:27:38,820
Keeps staring. - Ah.

324
00:27:40,164 --> 00:27:43,843
I actually get that look a lot. It's a look of envy,

325
00:27:44,491 --> 00:27:46,803
He is thinking: how can I make cool noises like that guy.

326
00:27:50,804 --> 00:27:54,012
You have such a great attitude about your...

327
00:27:58,019 --> 00:28:01,531
Bye, Homer. Bye, Ron. - bye-bye.

328
00:28:04,909 --> 00:28:08,379
So, that must have gone well, heh? Did you ask her out again?

329
00:28:09,099 --> 00:28:10,995
Yeah, I asked. but it's second-date syndrome.

330
00:28:11,643 --> 00:28:13,930
You know - I'm a great guy, she had a lot of fun, but...

331
00:28:14,538 --> 00:28:16,251
Your ticks are just too cool for her.

332
00:28:17,899 --> 00:28:20,571
No, actually she said because my roommate's breath smells so bad.

333
00:28:21,306 --> 00:28:22,763
What do you mean? - You know what I mean.

334
00:28:33,524 --> 00:28:36,194
This is Brad. Hi, Dad.

335
00:28:37,194 --> 00:28:41,730
No, Ron told me you called, I just...I've been so busy that..

336
00:28:43,147 --> 00:28:46,386
No, I haven't had lunch yet.

337
00:28:48,323 --> 00:28:50,836
All right, that sounds great. Where d'you wanna meet?

338
00:28:52,178 --> 00:28:53,330
Lunch at Dad's work.

339
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:56,466
He wouldn't have to worry about my noises there.

340
00:29:02,378 --> 00:29:04,802
Let me know if you need any more of those trusses, ok?

341
00:29:05,706 --> 00:29:10,481
Hey! Cheap in on you way! - Yeah. Let's grab lunch outside my office. a little more private. -All right.

342
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:16,826
Dianne is wondering when you're gonna come by. Guess you've been pretty busy with the job-hunting.

343
00:29:17,585 --> 00:29:19,233
Any luck? - Still interviewing.

344
00:29:20,537 --> 00:29:25,689
How's that going? Are they giving you any trouble with your...

345
00:29:26,361 --> 00:29:30,369
You can say the word, Dad. Tourette's. Some of them are, some of them aren't.

346
00:29:31,953 --> 00:29:35,585
How's your money holding out? - I'm not asking you for money.

347
00:29:36,249 --> 00:29:37,584
I know that. You never ask me for anything.

348
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,810
No. - But if ever you do get short, you know you get a job with me... - I'm gonna teach, Dad. Ok?

349
00:29:43,705 --> 00:29:45,401
I can't let anything get in the way of that.

350
00:29:45,931 --> 00:29:49,802
Ok. I'm just saying there is nothing wrong with keeping your options open, in case things don't work out.

351
00:29:50,786 --> 00:29:53,050
You know, there are other things besides teaching. - Not for me.

352
00:29:55,643 --> 00:29:58,482
Dad could never understand my optimism.

353
00:29:59,635 --> 00:30:04,458
Like when I graduated to middle school. I was really hopeful things would be different.

354
00:30:05,274 --> 00:30:09,002
What's the matter, Brad? Eating alone? - Make a fresh start.

355
00:30:09,723 --> 00:30:14,298
New school. New friends. Same result.

356
00:30:14,884 --> 00:30:17,218
Today we're gonna be talking about fractions.

357
00:30:18,073 --> 00:30:24,377
Fractions are your friend. You use fractions in everyday life, and - cha-chap - you just don't realize it.

358
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:35,378
For example, say your mother bakes a pie...She cuts the...Cohen! Just go to the principal's office.

359
00:30:36,306 --> 00:30:43,651
Not the best way to introduce myself to the principal.

360
00:30:49,346 --> 00:30:57,401
What do you think a school is for, Brad?

361
00:30:58,041 --> 00:31:03,146
I'm sorry I keep disrupting the class. - You're not answering my question. What's the school for?

362
00:31:04,457 --> 00:31:10,112
To educate, isn't it? To use knowledge to wipe out ignorance.

363
00:31:14,951 --> 00:31:20,472
School's orchestra is having a concert this afternoon, you're planning on going?- No sir.

364
00:31:21,127 --> 00:31:25,431
My tics will ruin the music. - I want you to be there.

365
00:31:58,462 --> 00:32:01,663
Everybody, just keep your seats for a minute, please.

366
00:32:02,751 --> 00:32:05,864
Thank you. Enjoyed the concert?

367
00:32:06,511 --> 00:32:07,774
Nice job!

368
00:32:08,936 --> 00:32:14,407
Did you hear any noises during the quiet parts? - Yes!

369
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:20,023
Yes, so did I. They are pretty annoying, aren't they?

370
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:24,574
The person making those noises is Brad Cohen.

371
00:32:26,629 --> 00:32:33,111
Come on up here, Brad.

372
00:33:09,925 --> 00:33:13,806
Do you like making noises and upsetting people, Brad?

373
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:15,917
No, sir.

374
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:18,005
Then why do you do it?

375
00:33:19,325 --> 00:33:21,989
Because I have Tourette syndrome.

376
00:33:23,157 --> 00:33:23,925
What's that?

377
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:28,493
It's the thing in my brain that causes me to make rude noises.

378
00:33:30,142 --> 00:33:33,525
But you could control it, if you wanted to, right?

379
00:33:34,388 --> 00:33:37,054
No, sir. It's a sickness.

380
00:33:38,284 --> 00:33:40,717
Well, why can't you just get cured?

381
00:33:41,757 --> 00:33:42,748
There isn't any cure.

382
00:33:45,516 --> 00:33:50,789
I don't like making noises any more than you like hearing them.

383
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:57,844
They are even worse when I get stressed. When you don't accept that I can't stop them.

384
00:33:58,932 --> 00:34:02,829
But when I feel accepted, then they are not so bad.

385
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:09,692
What can we do? And I mean - everyone in this school.

386
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:15,212
What can we do to help you, Brad?

387
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:21,404
I just want to be treated like everybody else.

388
00:34:24,694 --> 00:34:30,596
Good job. Go sit down.

389
00:35:05,292 --> 00:35:13,380
A few words, a little education, and it was like opening a door to a brand new world.

390
00:35:22,466 --> 00:35:32,449
Now, some day, some way I knew: Tourette's or no Tourette's, I was going to be a teacher.

391
00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:41,341
I had no choice but to prove Tourette's would never get the best of me.

392
00:35:42,095 --> 00:35:47,702
If I quit, I will be agreeing with everyone who had ever told me I was barking up the wrong tree.

393
00:35:51,926 --> 00:35:57,758
Sorry about the air conditioning, it's supposed to have been fixed by now.

394
00:35:58,572 --> 00:36:06,237
Well, your resume looks ok, and we do have an opening in the fifth grade.

395
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:15,788
But I do have to tell you, this is a tough place to work. We've got some really hard cases.

396
00:36:16,421 --> 00:36:19,556
I'll take this as a challenge. I don't believe that any kid is hopeless.

397
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:24,333
I mean, they all wanna learn. You can't ever give up on them, you just gotta find the right way to teach them.

398
00:36:25,148 --> 00:36:26,788
You got something stuck in your throat, would you like a drink?

399
00:36:27,388 --> 00:36:32,460
I have tourette syndrome.I'd like to tell you about it.  - Tourette - isn't that when you yell out obscenities?

400
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:37,876
That's corpolalia. It's a rare symptom. A small percentage of people with Tourette's have it. I don't.

401
00:36:37,892 --> 00:36:40,364
Listen, they didn't tell me that you're gonna be handicapped.

402
00:36:41,765 --> 00:36:45,653
How do you expect to handle a bunch of wild students, with a handicap like that?

403
00:36:46,221 --> 00:36:48,557
Well...by educating them.

404
00:36:49,134 --> 00:36:53,628
I'll let them know that it's OK to talk about it. - These students would laugh at you.

405
00:36:55,645 --> 00:37:01,163
Not...not when they understand that's simply a matter of...

406
00:37:02,044 --> 00:37:06,395
I've seen teachers with disabilities before. And never with what you've got.

407
00:37:07,868 --> 00:37:13,444
I just don't see how you could ever teach a class. - I can teach.

408
00:37:14,035 --> 00:37:16,604
Look at my resume. Look at it!

409
00:37:17,341 --> 00:37:22,292
I was very successful as a student teacher. My Tourette's has never posed a problem. I can teach.

410
00:37:23,236 --> 00:37:32,860
Ok, bottom line. I need somebody now for the fifth grade. You want to teach here - you're gonna have to refrain from making these noises in class.

411
00:37:37,315 --> 00:37:40,221
You know what...Thank you very much for the interview. - But don't you want the job?

412
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:46,667
Yes, actually, I want it really bad. But I would never, ever work for a man who doesn't care about his students.

413
00:37:47,412 --> 00:37:50,139
So, I'll take my portfolio and take no more of your time.

414
00:37:51,516 --> 00:37:53,091
You got a great boss.

415
00:38:47,108 --> 00:38:48,908
It was the worst interview I've ever had.

416
00:38:49,523 --> 00:38:50,980
The only thing he could see when he looked at me was my Tourettes.

417
00:38:52,156 --> 00:38:53,324
It's all any of them see.

418
00:38:54,141 --> 00:38:58,036
Oh, honey, if they can't see what a great teacher you would be, it's their failure, not yours.

419
00:38:58,876 --> 00:39:00,123
Well, it sure seems like my failure.

420
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:05,115
Well, if you say so. You know what?

421
00:39:06,236 --> 00:39:09,339
Why don't you just throw in the towel and come home, huh? I'll buy you the ticket.

422
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:13,803
I'm not saying thet.- Really? It sounds like that's what you're saying. It sounds like you're letting Tourette's win.

423
00:39:14,739 --> 00:39:17,355
I'm not letting Tourette's win. - Really? - Yes, really.

424
00:39:19,243 --> 00:39:23,699
Look, I'm never gonna give up, I just...

425
00:39:24,523 --> 00:39:29,668
I have to find the right school. - You will, Bobo. You will.

426
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:37,149
So, I decided it wasn't tourette's. I just hadn't found the right school yet.

427
00:39:37,918 --> 00:39:41,646
I'd keep barking and I wasn't quitting until I found that principal.

428
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:45,525
I made a map of every school where I hadn't interviewd.

429
00:40:14,869 --> 00:40:21,396
If the principal wasn't in, I'd give my resume to a secretary, or a janitor,
and ask them to drop it off when the principle returned.

430
00:40:22,013 --> 00:40:23,804
I didn't care. I needed a job.

431
00:40:30,574 --> 00:40:33,501
I wasn't gonna stop, until I had.

432
00:40:36,356 --> 00:40:37,948
You'll be starting at the bottom, but that's no big deal.

433
00:40:38,741 --> 00:40:39,876
That's where I started.

434
00:40:40,427 --> 00:40:42,275
You're working from 7 to 4. - I told you this only part-time.

435
00:40:43,141 --> 00:40:44,276
I need to keep my mornings open for  interviews.

436
00:40:45,091 --> 00:40:46,980
I thought that schools had started already. - No, not all of them.

437
00:40:48,348 --> 00:40:51,027
Well, we'll see what happens. Here're your tools of the train.

438
00:40:52,565 --> 00:40:54,643
Just for the time-being. Like I said, bottom.

439
00:40:55,523 --> 00:40:58,003
But every job is important here, and - who knows - maybe you'll end up liking it.

440
00:40:59,012 --> 00:41:00,716
And if you put your time in...- Did you hear what I just said?

441
00:41:02,443 --> 00:41:03,516
I'm only working here until I get a teaching job.

442
00:41:06,596 --> 00:41:09,093
All that stuff has to go in the dumpster.

443
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:13,204
The hiring season was ending.

444
00:41:14,181 --> 00:41:17,012
My interviews had dried up. School had started.

445
00:41:17,771 --> 00:41:21,388
I was running out of time and money. And hope.

446
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:36,475
Dianne. - I gave up on you ever coming to me, so I just came to you. You busy?

447
00:41:37,859 --> 00:41:41,850
It was my stepmom Dianne, trying to build bridges with bagels.

448
00:41:42,963 --> 00:41:46,331
Your Dad built his business with his own two hands, you can't blame him for wanting you to be a part of it.

449
00:41:47,874 --> 00:41:48,891
He's just being a Dad.

450
00:41:49,963 --> 00:41:51,690
He wants you in his life.

451
00:41:56,036 --> 00:41:59,202
So, how do you like Atlanta? got to meet any nice girls?

452
00:42:02,155 --> 00:42:06,689
I'm just saying all the right things,heh? - Let me get you a refill.

453
00:42:07,819 --> 00:42:14,394
Brad. You Dad loves you. So much.

454
00:42:15,538 --> 00:42:19,115
He just doesn't wanna see you get hurt.

455
00:42:20,762 --> 00:42:23,754
The only thing that hurts is the fact that he has never accepted who I am.

456
00:42:25,058 --> 00:42:29,379
See, he's got this idea of a perfect son, who is normal and does normal things.

457
00:42:30,137 --> 00:42:31,250
Well, I'm never gonna be normal.

458
00:42:32,441 --> 00:42:36,753
Or maybe that's not his idea, Brad. Maybe, that's yours.

459
00:42:37,945 --> 00:42:45,201
And you're right. You are not normal. You have a gift. To teach.

460
00:42:49,001 --> 00:42:56,666
And it's not in spite of your Tourette's . It's because of it.

461
00:43:04,104 --> 00:43:05,985
I have to go.

462
00:43:27,665 --> 00:43:33,905
Hello, this is Brad. Yes, that's a sheep-dog.

463
00:43:35,152 --> 00:43:41,343
Yep, right, Brad cohen. 10 o'clock is perfect for me.

464
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:44,592
Absolutely. Ok, great.

465
00:44:09,167 --> 00:44:10,487
You must be Brad Cohen.

466
00:44:13,544 --> 00:44:18,151
I'm the principal around here. - Hillary Streick, assistant principal.

467
00:44:19,113 --> 00:44:22,914
Come on in the office, Brad. - We heard you coming all the way from the parking lot.

468
00:44:25,239 --> 00:44:29,519
You've been making the rounds. - 25 schools so far. And here is my resume.

469
00:44:29,975 --> 00:44:34,848
We're gonna look at it in a minute, Brad. Just come on in and tell us why you wanna be a teacher.

470
00:44:36,103 --> 00:44:42,815
Ok, it's a...It's all I ever wanted to be. Ever since I was in school.

471
00:44:43,487 --> 00:44:45,407
You must have had some pretty inspiring teachers.

472
00:44:46,087 --> 00:44:48,503
Oh, well. I had an inspiring principal, Mr Myer.

473
00:44:49,399 --> 00:44:54,062
But my teachers, they really inspired me to be the kind of teacher they never were.

474
00:44:55,358 --> 00:44:56,878
Waht kind of teacher is that?

475
00:44:58,815 --> 00:45:01,253
One who makes it possible for a kid to learn, even if he is different.

476
00:45:03,632 --> 00:45:06,510
In a way, the best teacher I ever had was my Tourette's.

477
00:45:07,798 --> 00:45:12,534
You don't have to talk about...- No, that's ok. I make a point of being open about it.

478
00:45:13,606 --> 00:45:17,846
It's never off the list to my students. they can ask me anything they want about it any time.

479
00:45:19,542 --> 00:45:24,118
You must get some pretty interesting questions. - Oh, yeah. Sometimes it gets really personal.

480
00:45:25,879 --> 00:45:27,933
I hope this question isn't too personal, Brad.

481
00:45:31,207 --> 00:45:33,094
Do you make those noises in your sleep?

482
00:45:35,181 --> 00:45:37,886
I don't know. I'm asleep.

483
00:45:41,758 --> 00:45:47,168
No, I don't tic in my sleep. When I'm relaxed, the noises give me a little bit of a break. Like just now.

484
00:45:48,934 --> 00:45:52,126
Ok, Brad. I wanna hear more about your teaching philosophy.

485
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:55,398
Yeah, I'd love to tell you about my teaching philosophy.

486
00:45:56,031 --> 00:46:00,517
We talked for nearly 2 hours. It was the best interveiw I had ever had.

487
00:46:02,717 --> 00:46:04,974
Well, Brad. It was a pleasure to meet you. - You, too.

488
00:46:05,622 --> 00:46:09,653
We've still got a few more teachers to interview, but we'll let you know when we've made a decision.

489
00:46:10,597 --> 00:46:11,974
Great. Thank you - Thank you.

490
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:23,622
Still, my constant companion, as always, warned me not to get my hopes up.

491
00:46:26,535 --> 00:46:30,382
But hope is a hard habit to break.

492
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:12,570
I was called one last time adn asked to come in and meet with the second grade staff.

493
00:47:14,859 --> 00:47:17,098
Oh, so you as student taught second grade?

494
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:20,395
I love second grade. the kids are still so open-minded.

495
00:47:21,449 --> 00:47:22,627
They are oped to everything.

496
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:27,498
Yes, but you do manage to maintain a little discipline, right? While they are being so open?

497
00:47:28,546 --> 00:47:30,378
I do let them know what the boundaries are,  yes.

498
00:47:31,411 --> 00:47:35,450
So Brad, what do you think is the most important thing you have to teach?

499
00:47:36,858 --> 00:47:43,323
Well, besides the importance of reading and the value of math, that it's ok to be yourself.

500
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:47,810
It's ok to color outside the lines, if that's who you are.

501
00:47:49,274 --> 00:47:53,106
So, it's ok to ignore the boundaries? - No, and I didn't...

502
00:47:57,185 --> 00:48:00,729
I'm sorry, but how can you expect kids to learn, when you are doing this all the time?

503
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:05,361
Oh, come on, Brenda - No, it's ok. It's a valid question, and I wanna answer it.

504
00:48:07,601 --> 00:48:11,994
Before they know me, kids sometimes think I'm just weird or even scary.

505
00:48:13,273 --> 00:48:14,497
But once I educate them about my Tourette's,

506
00:48:15,753 --> 00:48:19,729
and they can see that Mr Cohen is a real person, who just happens to have funny noises

507
00:48:20,513 --> 00:48:26,961
then they accept me as a good teacher. Just like they accept all of you.

508
00:48:30,001 --> 00:48:33,210
Well, maybe we should all try to be more like 2nd graders.

509
00:48:34,393 --> 00:48:37,024
Does anyone have any other question for Mr Cohen?

510
00:48:38,936 --> 00:48:44,401
Brad, thanks for coming in. The school will be in touch with you, so just be patient.

511
00:48:45,472 --> 00:48:47,680
It's hard to be patient when you feel as though you've blown your last chance.

512
00:48:49,008 --> 00:48:51,337
And patience was never my constant companion strong suit.

513
00:48:52,136 --> 00:48:55,200
I guess you never heard from that school. - No, not yet. They are still interviewing.

514
00:48:56,705 --> 00:49:00,624
I'm not worried. - Ok... - What's that supposed to mean? - I just said "Ok".

515
00:49:02,256 --> 00:49:06,224
I know what you mean. You don't tnink anybody would hire me, if they had a choice.
So you're a mind-reader now?

516
00:49:07,415 --> 00:49:09,873
You know what, Dad? This is gonna be my last day here.

517
00:49:10,583 --> 00:49:13,888
Why don't you wait and see if you got the job first? - I'm gonna get the job, Dad.

518
00:49:14,799 --> 00:49:18,727
I just have to stay focused. - Why can't you stay focused and realistic at the same time?What's wrong with that?

519
00:49:29,944 --> 00:49:32,639
Wow, you all right, man? You'll knock yourself out doing that.

520
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:35,616
What if that happens while you're driving? - I'm fine.

521
00:49:36,359 --> 00:49:38,759
Yeah, I don't know. You've got to see another doctor.

522
00:49:39,689 --> 00:49:42,207
I've seen doctors my whole life, Ron. And they don't help.

523
00:49:43,064 --> 00:49:52,472
Don't you think you need to see somebody? - I really don't. Just...

524
00:49:58,815 --> 00:50:02,039
There I was, waiting for the phone ring again.

525
00:50:03,390 --> 00:50:05,823
I treid to convince myself something good would happen.

526
00:50:15,678 --> 00:50:18,600
My kid brother.Not exactly what I had in mind.

527
00:50:20,502 --> 00:50:21,303
How're you doing, Bobo?

528
00:50:22,246 --> 00:50:25,198
What are you doing here? why didn't you tell me you were coming?

529
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:27,966
You know, you're in your boxers.

530
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:32,614
Did Mom send you to check up on me? -Why, you need checking up on?

531
00:50:33,781 --> 00:50:37,814
No, but... - Where I put my stuff? - Great. You get the couch.

532
00:50:39,734 --> 00:50:41,213
Wow! Nice clubs, are these new?

533
00:50:42,002 --> 00:50:45,878
They are Dad's, he let me borrow them. Thought maybe you'd like to play a little golf.

534
00:50:46,558 --> 00:50:51,606
So, what d' you think, ... a hand from you little bro?

535
00:50:52,709 --> 00:50:54,894
Hey, by the way, thanks for the round. - Thank Dad.

536
00:50:55,622 --> 00:51:00,086
Oh, wait. You guys aren't speaking. - I don't wanna talk about that right now.

537
00:51:00,814 --> 00:51:04,222
You're just saying that to rattle me, because you know I'm going to beat you.

538
00:51:04,838 --> 00:51:10,572
I'm serious, Brad, you and Dad got to start getting along.- We get along just fine. As long as we keep a long distance.

539
00:51:11,358 --> 00:51:13,022
Is that why you moved down here? To keep a long distance?

540
00:51:13,829 --> 00:51:15,293
I mean, it's not like you've got anything to prove to him, right?

541
00:51:15,981 --> 00:51:18,110
What are you now, Jeff - a shrink? Dr. Jeff, heh?

542
00:51:19,591 --> 00:51:23,533
I'm sorry, sir. I'm going to ask yo to stop making those noises.

543
00:51:24,205 --> 00:51:26,237
Pal, he's not doing this because..- No, no, I can handle it, Jeff, I got it.

544
00:51:27,733 --> 00:51:28,933
It's just not fair to the other golfers. - No, I understand.

545
00:51:29,613 --> 00:51:32,813
I can't help making these noises. Because I have Tourette syndrome.

546
00:51:33,452 --> 00:51:35,317
It's a neurological disorder. I'd like to tell you about it.

547
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:39,030
You gonna have to leave the course. I've got to think about the other members.

548
00:51:41,708 --> 00:51:43,172
Hey, Joe, leave the guy alone. He's fine.

549
00:51:44,293 --> 00:51:48,765
Hey, man, we're twosome and our buddies don't appear to be showing. Would you like to join us?

550
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:57,020
If you don't leave, I'm gonna have to call security. - Ok, ok.Thanks guys. Maybe, next year, right?

551
00:51:58,158 --> 00:52:01,084
Jeff, come on. Come on, buddy. thanks.

552
00:52:06,476 --> 00:52:08,068
Come on, Jeff, it's not like you haven't seen it before.

553
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:10,716
How can you stand living in the world, where everybody is so ignorant.

554
00:52:11,638 --> 00:52:16,116
Everybody's not. You saw these golfers back there, They want to bet for me. My life is full of people like that.

555
00:52:16,965 --> 00:52:20,892
That's not always my experience. - Well, that's because  you're always getting in the fight sticking up for me.

556
00:52:21,451 --> 00:52:22,780
You and Mom. You've always been there for me and my tics.

557
00:52:24,667 --> 00:52:30,108
You know what? - What? - You're beginning to tic, be off racing car. Sucker! - Hey! cheater!

558
00:52:30,843 --> 00:52:32,940
Jeff's visit did give me a break from my worries.

559
00:52:33,788 --> 00:52:35,708
And after he left, I got a call from the school.

560
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:41,515
The principle wanted to see me in his office. Just like old times.

561
00:52:57,963 --> 00:52:58,867
Pretty noisy, heh?

562
00:53:00,533 --> 00:53:09,443
And yet, some other kids manage. Don't they?- Yes, they do. they do.

563
00:53:11,491 --> 00:53:13,451
Hillary and I discussed you with the teachers.

564
00:53:15,635 --> 00:53:23,003
And we talked about how proud we are of teaching our kids to never let anything hold them back in life.

565
00:53:25,098 --> 00:53:31,386
And Hillary said: if we're gonna talk the talk, we need to walk the walk.

566
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:36,851
She's waiting to show you your classroom. Welcome.

567
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:44,898
Second grade is overcrowded, so we had to create a new class.

568
00:53:45,091 --> 00:53:50,443
Your kids are being taken out of other rooms, so some of them might be a little confused. They've been in school for 3 weeks.

569
00:53:57,818 --> 00:53:59,363
There's your student roster.

570
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:05,235
The fun starts Monday, Brad, let me know if there's anything you need.

571
00:54:06,227 --> 00:54:07,570
I need everything.

572
00:54:08,522 --> 00:54:13,108
I looked down at that roster, like I was announcing the starting line-up for an all-star baseball game.

573
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:15,105
Hillary, this is...thank you.

574
00:54:16,806 --> 00:54:18,061
We thought you might need these.

575
00:54:19,844 --> 00:54:23,900
Hey, everybody, come in. Just put them down anywhere, we'll get them arranged.

576
00:54:25,212 --> 00:54:26,493
Here, let me help you with that. thank you.

577
00:54:31,661 --> 00:54:34,510
Welcome to Mountain View.

578
00:54:37,022 --> 00:54:41,004
Yeh, Mom, it's phenomenal, but you know, it took me so long to get here,
I still have to remind myself that I'm just at the beginning.

579
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:47,747
Honey, that is...that is wonderful news. Wonderful!

580
00:54:48,596 --> 00:54:51,773
Yes, Mom, it is absolutely wonderful, but you know: they 're going to give me a contract for a year, ok?

581
00:54:52,716 --> 00:54:54,932
I still have to prove to them that they've made the right choice.

582
00:54:55,644 --> 00:54:57,907
Honey, listen. Just take a moment to enjoy this. Oh, my Gosh!

583
00:54:59,172 --> 00:55:02,108
Did you call your father? He's gonna be so proud of you. - I will, Mom.

584
00:55:02,859 --> 00:55:06,796
But you know, right now I literally have about 2 weeks of preparation to do in about 2 days.

585
00:55:07,875 --> 00:55:12,308
Adn, you know, now that I have the job, I have to seriously start working on getting my Masters degree.

586
00:55:13,426 --> 00:55:14,332
Ok, one thing at a time. all right?

587
00:55:15,003 --> 00:55:16,691
Listen, are there any cute teachers at that school? - MOM!

588
00:55:17,773 --> 00:55:22,051
I want you to be happy. - Ok, all right, don't worry, I'm working on that, too. I gotta go, good bye.

589
00:55:41,946 --> 00:55:47,259
You must be Brad. - You must be Nancy.

590
00:55:48,331 --> 00:55:49,922
Hi, I'm Brad.- I know.

591
00:55:51,851 --> 00:55:55,171
Right, of course. I guess, we are a little nervous. Please...

592
00:55:57,155 --> 00:55:59,274
This is my first time computer dating, so...

593
00:56:01,242 --> 00:56:03,236
Me, too. My Mom thinks it's dangerous.

594
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:06,354
Well, yeah. You never know what kind of weirdo you might meet.

595
00:56:07,794 --> 00:56:09,650
But you look pretty normal, so...

596
00:56:11,802 --> 00:56:18,578
Good, I'm glad. - Actually, you look much better that normal. - Thank you.

597
00:56:20,819 --> 00:56:24,251
So, I guess we're supoosed to tell each other our life-stories, or...

598
00:56:25,217 --> 00:56:28,938
Ok, do you think you could get a cup of coffee first?

599
00:56:29,625 --> 00:56:33,865
Cup of coffee? - Yeah. - Right. Of course, coming on. - thanks.

600
00:56:34,769 --> 00:56:41,394
Do yo want, like a...muffin? - I'm on a diet. But I would love a muffin.

601
00:56:49,546 --> 00:56:52,858
My roommate is driving me absolutely crazy.

602
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:56,921
She never makes her bed, she's got clothes everywhere.

603
00:56:57,897 --> 00:57:05,833
Always blasting her music, night and day. But of course, whenever I wanna listen to my music, she's all like:you need to keep it down.

604
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:08,560
So, what kind of music do you listen to?

605
00:57:11,217 --> 00:57:15,840
Well, mostly olde stuff, especially Stein. I love Stein.

606
00:57:18,416 --> 00:57:21,656
Madonna, Bon Jovy, you know... - Milli Vanilli?

607
00:57:23,745 --> 00:57:28,233
I love Milli Vanilli.- Really? - Wait, you too?

608
00:57:29,096 --> 00:57:33,809
I've got to be the only two people on earth that love Milli Vanilli. - We do not...-Yeah!

609
00:57:39,825 --> 00:57:42,848
I had a really nice time, thank you.

610
00:57:44,872 --> 00:57:47,137
I shouldn't have had that muffin, but...

611
00:57:48,399 --> 00:57:51,272
I really enjoyed meeting you. - Yeah, me too.

612
00:57:55,023 --> 00:57:57,960
I mean...well, thanks again, Brad.

613
00:58:12,999 --> 00:58:15,768
I cant' believe you. You said she was perfect.

614
00:58:16,903 --> 00:58:20,511
She was perfect. I just didn't want to ruin it. -Oh, by asking her out again?

615
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:23,895
Oh, right. Second- date syndrome.

616
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,720
So, it that gonna be your life? nothing but first and only dates?

617
00:58:28,935 --> 00:58:33,175
How do ever expect to have a relationship? - Maybe, I don't.

618
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:16,219
Come on in. Get in there. Come on in.

619
01:00:17,571 --> 01:00:19,683
Weirdo!

620
01:00:25,659 --> 01:00:31,571
Did your teachers warn you that Mr Cohen makes funny noises? - Yes.

621
01:00:32,235 --> 01:00:35,434
She said you have Tour..Tor... - Tourette syndrom.

622
01:00:36,147 --> 01:00:38,956
Ok. Anything you wanna know about it, I want you to ask.

623
01:00:40,362 --> 01:00:41,787
Yes.  - Is it catching?

624
01:00:42,699 --> 01:00:45,691
No, absolutely not. You have to be born with it, like I was.

625
01:00:47,746 --> 01:00:53,026
Does it hurt? - Well, sometimes, when my neck jerks, but noises do not hurt at all.

626
01:00:54,554 --> 01:00:55,946
These are great questions. Keep in coming.

627
01:00:57,282 --> 01:00:59,866
Adn it's ok to ask me anything about Tourette's.

628
01:01:01,010 --> 01:01:07,418
Yes. Can you go to movies? - Yes, I can go to movies, but sometimes I get kicked out and that makes me sad.

629
01:01:10,626 --> 01:01:14,402
What's the bunny's name? - Wa..Wa..Waffle.

630
01:01:15,177 --> 01:01:20,930
Wa-wa-waffle? - His name is just Waffle.

631
01:01:21,649 --> 01:01:25,226
All right, guys, any more questions about Tourette's?

632
01:01:26,722 --> 01:01:31,153
Anyone. - Are they ever gonna make you well, Mr Cohen?

633
01:01:32,953 --> 01:01:34,962
Well, right now there is no medicine that can cure Tourette's.

634
01:01:36,089 --> 01:01:39,417
But it's ok, I've learned to accept it and I don't let it run my life.

635
01:01:40,609 --> 01:01:44,442
What can't you do? Like...can you not eat?

636
01:01:45,657 --> 01:01:50,289
I can eat. I eat a lot. In fact, I can do anything that anybody else can do, except...

637
01:01:51,144 --> 01:01:53,546
there is one thing that Mr Cohen can never do.

638
01:01:54,633 --> 01:01:59,306
What? - I can't. - What is it?- No, I just can't. - Tell us!- No.

639
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:05,232
Mr Cohen can never play hide-and-go-seek.

640
01:02:08,377 --> 01:02:12,432
Why can't you play hide-and-seek? - Because they'll hear him, stupid!

641
01:02:13,888 --> 01:02:18,696
Well, that's the right answer, but it's the wrong words, because there won't be any name-calling in Mr Cohen's class.

642
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:22,600
Excuse me, where are you going? - Bathroom.- What's your name? - Thomas.

643
01:02:23,521 --> 01:02:26,745
Ok, well, Thomas, if you want to leave your seat, you have to ask for permission.

644
01:02:28,777 --> 01:02:31,448
Weirdo!

645
01:02:34,953 --> 01:02:39,743
Bye, Mr Cohen - Bye, Kewin. - Bye, Mr Cohen. - Bye, Heather. I'll see you tomorrow.

646
01:02:43,648 --> 01:02:49,673
I really liked your class, Mr Cohen. - Well, thank you, Amanda. How're you doing, Mr Wreight? - I'm fine.

647
01:02:53,769 --> 01:02:56,983
Stop! Leave me alone. - Ok, take him, Thomas!

648
01:02:58,255 --> 01:03:02,582
Weilai, Thomas! Which one of you, guys, thinks that you can help me? - I can. I can.

649
01:03:03,855 --> 01:03:07,583
All right, here's the deal: I need to get this ball and put it back in that bin. Why don't you guys shoot for it?

650
01:03:08,391 --> 01:03:10,040
Rock, paper, scissors, shoe.

651
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:14,591
All right, Heely, you win today.- Oh, man! - it's ok, Thomas, you can help him.

652
01:03:23,079 --> 01:03:26,534
Sorry, I stuck you with Thomas.He was making my class impossible.

653
01:03:27,494 --> 01:03:36,110
He's got a whole outfit of problems: ADD, ADHD, OCD. You want my advice? You'll pass him on to special ed. - No.

654
01:03:38,917 --> 01:03:42,806
I can't do that. - You'll see how you feel after he's trashed a few classes.

655
01:03:43,622 --> 01:03:47,950
He'll be allright. I just need to get settled. I can't wait for tomorrow. - Ok.

656
01:04:03,190 --> 01:04:10,054
You make more noise than my air-horn. Sounds like you got a healthy case of Tourette's.

657
01:04:11,598 --> 01:04:15,310
I was just kidding with you, son. Got a dispatcher buddy with TS.

658
01:04:16,981 --> 01:04:20,174
You ever need a cross-country all-in, jsut call for Maxine.

659
01:04:21,271 --> 01:04:27,429
Hey, do you have a card? - I wasn't being serious, son. Unless you're in the shipping business.

660
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:30,598
No, I teach 2nd grade.

661
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:38,269
Here's the card. Maxine gave me a great idea for a geography lesson. - Thank you so much, Maxine. - You're welcome. - Safe trucking.

662
01:04:41,245 --> 01:04:43,005
I found myself focusing on teaching all the time.

663
01:04:45,118 --> 01:04:47,909
Well, almost.

664
01:05:22,185 --> 01:05:27,809
You know what I just  realized? - What? - All ducks have Tourette's.

665
01:05:29,202 --> 01:05:34,722
Why is that? - I don't know. WE are birds of a feather.

666
01:05:49,431 --> 01:05:51,671
So, it really doesn't bother you, does it? - What?

667
01:05:53,263 --> 01:05:55,288
You know what. My Tourette's, my noises.

668
01:05:56,427 --> 01:06:00,617
Not when I compare them to the noises other guys make.

669
01:06:02,035 --> 01:06:10,081
You know, like braggers, loud talkers. Like egocentric, humor-challenged idiots.

670
01:06:11,098 --> 01:06:14,594
Seriously, no.Your noises don't bother me at all. As long as they keep me laughing.

671
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:18,297
Well. don't say that. You know how I get under pressure. - Oh, I'm sorry.

672
01:06:21,225 --> 01:06:23,506
My Dad always said I was gonna marry someone whol made me laugh.

673
01:06:27,186 --> 01:06:30,424
Not that it has anything to do with...anything.

674
01:06:37,825 --> 01:06:45,705
Say something. - Quack!

675
01:06:47,809 --> 01:06:53,009
Don't laugh, this was a serious quack. I got you, though.

676
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:04,648
Mr Cohen! - Hey! - My Mom said to ask it it's ok.

677
01:07:05,791 --> 01:07:08,848
Is what ok, Heather? - If I give this to Waffle.

678
01:07:10,408 --> 01:07:13,280
You tell your Mom that I said that's fine. Ok?

679
01:07:16,264 --> 01:07:27,297
He said that's Ok? - Yeah. -I love you. - I love you, too. I'll see you right after school.

680
01:07:37,607 --> 01:07:39,983
Amanda, is everything all right?

681
01:07:40,663 --> 01:07:44,312
I wanna be in your class, Mr Cohen. - You are in my class, Amanda.

682
01:07:45,264 --> 01:07:47,369
No, he made them take me out.

683
01:07:52,096 --> 01:07:54,511
See you after school, honey, ok? - It's not fair!

684
01:07:56,143 --> 01:07:59,422
Is everything ok? I'm Amanda's teacher, Mr Cohen. We met yesterday.

685
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:05,511
Oh, no, there's nothing wrong. I just have to do what's right for my daughter. Come on, Amanda.

686
01:08:06,391 --> 01:08:07,871
Come on!

687
01:08:11,038 --> 01:08:16,903
He's concerned about Amanda's ability to concentrate. He just thought that you'll make it a little harder for her.

688
01:08:17,542 --> 01:08:20,022
Can he just give me a chance? We've only just started.

689
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:28,159
I pointed that out. - And? - He said he's sympathetic, but Amanda needs, as he put it, a "normal" teacher.

690
01:08:29,893 --> 01:08:35,078
Don't take it to heart, Brad. Parents are the hardest part of the job.

691
01:08:36,015 --> 01:08:40,503
All right. Who can tell me the names of the capitals Maxine and her big red truck have to pass through?

692
01:08:41,423 --> 01:08:45,287
Anybody? Oh, these hands! Excuse me, excuse me...

693
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:47,383
Oh, man, who do I choose?

694
01:08:50,039 --> 01:08:53,006
I don't know...Heather!

695
01:08:54,150 --> 01:09:00,838
Atlanta, Nashville, Springfield...That's great. Because a lot of people think it's Chicago and...

696
01:09:01,887 --> 01:09:06,071
This is Springfield, right? -No, that's Indianapolis.

697
01:09:07,597 --> 01:09:11,982
Oh, that's right, what am I thinking! This is Springfield.. - No.

698
01:09:13,694 --> 01:09:15,894
That's Columbus. Springfield is over there, Mr Cohen.

699
01:09:16,646 --> 01:09:18,430
Where is it, Heely, over here? - No!

700
01:09:20,350 --> 01:09:24,591
Where is Springfield? I don't know, you guys have to point it out for me. Point out, point it out!

701
01:09:25,893 --> 01:09:28,126
I don't see Springfield.

702
01:09:32,013 --> 01:09:37,909
Aaa, I see it. You're telling me that this is Springfield, right? - YES!

703
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:40,893
You don't have a permission to leave your seat, Thomas.

704
01:09:42,557 --> 01:09:45,293
That's right, Mr Cohen has eyes on the back of his head. Go back and sit down, please.

705
01:09:46,214 --> 01:09:51,021
And next time ask. - I need to sharpen my pencil. - Now, Thomas.

706
01:09:54,734 --> 01:10:00,343
All right, now: where is Maxine and her big red truck gonna be on Tuesday?

707
01:10:01,653 --> 01:10:02,645
See you right early tomorrow, David.

708
01:10:04,636 --> 01:10:06,301
All right. Hey, remember to walk.

709
01:10:08,125 --> 01:10:11,268
I really like your hat, Mr Cohen. - Thank you, Heather. I like your hair.

710
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:14,992
It's so short because of the medicine. Bye.

711
01:10:17,935 --> 01:10:19,291
Hi, honey! - Hi, Mom!

712
01:10:22,994 --> 01:10:25,738
Can you wait right here for just a minute? - Sure.

713
01:10:28,473 --> 01:10:31,393
Hey. I've been meaning to come and speak to you about Heather. - I think I know.

714
01:10:33,356 --> 01:10:35,233
Yeah, we were just reluctant to tell anyone at first.

715
01:10:36,322 --> 01:10:38,601
Of course, it was only a matter of time before the chemo became obvious, so...

716
01:10:41,208 --> 01:10:42,872
Is she gonna be ok?

717
01:10:45,249 --> 01:10:50,114
Heather just loves your class. She can't wait to get to school every day.

718
01:10:51,904 --> 01:10:58,544
And... I'd be grateful if you kept her secret a little longer. I just don't want her to be singled out.

719
01:11:00,185 --> 01:11:05,377
YEah. - thanks. - Hi, baby girl. Let's go.

720
01:11:15,433 --> 01:11:19,673
Oh-oh. What do you think, what do you think?

721
01:11:20,481 --> 01:11:22,737
I already have that one. - What? - Looks great on you, though.

722
01:11:24,946 --> 01:11:30,865
Hey, what's wrong? - Oh, nothing, I'm just focusing on the school stuff.

723
01:11:31,985 --> 01:11:34,673
Can you focus on me for a minute? - Sorry.

724
01:11:35,737 --> 01:11:37,633
Hey, try this one on. It'll make you feel better.

725
01:11:38,713 --> 01:11:42,768
Yes! - Really?- Oh, my Goodness, this suits you.

726
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:52,321
More than you know. I've decided it's time to go for my Master's degree.

727
01:11:53,807 --> 01:11:58,352
Wow! Does that mean you'll be going away?

728
01:11:59,584 --> 01:12:03,992
No, I'll go locally. Anyhow, I'll have to pass the entrance test to graduate school first, so...

729
01:12:04,784 --> 01:12:10,840
Oh, wait. Isn't it like the SATs? Do you have to take that in a big room with a lot of people?

730
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,336
They said I could have a room all to myself.

731
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:16,072
Good. - Tourette's does have its privileges.

732
01:12:18,991 --> 01:12:20,912
Would it bother you if I did go away?

733
01:12:21,856 --> 01:12:24,168
Of course it would, are you kidding? Get out of here!

734
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,303
Come here, I wanna show you something. - Crazy!

735
01:12:29,031 --> 01:12:32,879
Next! - Hi....Brad Cohen. - Brad cohen?

736
01:12:35,319 --> 01:12:39,422
You're Mr cohen. All right, I need you to take this package and I need you to go right in there for me.

737
01:12:40,302 --> 01:12:41,967
Oh. I' supposed to have special accomodations.

738
01:12:43,102 --> 01:12:45,957
I don't have any notation of that.

739
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:48,637
And everybody does the test on the same conditions today.

740
01:12:49,877 --> 01:12:54,142
Yeah, but I called and they said ...they said that I could have a spage to myslef.

741
01:12:54,971 --> 01:12:59,109
You know what, I need you to talk to the administrator about that. His office is right over there.

742
01:13:01,661 --> 01:13:03,732
I can't make an exception. We are not set up that way.

743
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:10,356
They promised, and I have the right to special testing accomodations. - Listen, I'm sorry about your disability,
but there isn't anything that I can do.

744
01:13:11,307 --> 01:13:13,436
If you want to take the test, you'll have to go in there now.

745
01:13:14,164 --> 01:13:19,644
Look at me! How can anyone possibly concentrate, if I'm in that room? - Listen, I have to start the exam now.

746
01:13:22,188 --> 01:13:26,812
Do you need me to call you a doctor? Isn't there anyone you could call for help?

747
01:13:27,948 --> 01:13:29,379
Brad, calm down, I can't understand you.

748
01:13:30,867 --> 01:13:32,283
They said you could take it alone?

749
01:13:33,756 --> 01:13:36,758
Ok, all right, no problem. I'll be right there. - Has something happened?

750
01:13:46,211 --> 01:13:48,244
You can take the test. And you'll have a room to yourself.

751
01:13:49,447 --> 01:13:54,288
What did you say to them? - The magic word. Lawsuit. I gotta get to work

752
01:13:56,288 --> 01:14:01,703
Hey, Dad. - Yeah? - Thanks. - Good luck on the test.

753
01:14:07,504 --> 01:14:12,960
As it turned out, I needed more than just Dad's "Good luck". I needed time.

754
01:14:14,321 --> 01:14:19,295
With the clock and my Tourette's ticking away, I failed to get all the way through the test.

755
01:14:30,022 --> 01:14:34,726
Good job, guys! Thomas, I'm so proud of you. - Thank you, Mr Cohen.

756
01:14:35,359 --> 01:14:38,543
Wow, look at that turkey, Heather. - Thank you.

757
01:14:39,519 --> 01:14:42,030
So, are you gonna have a big Thanksgiving this year?

758
01:14:42,758 --> 01:14:46,920
Aha. Mom says all my grandparents are gonna come. - Well, taht sounds special.

759
01:14:47,758 --> 01:14:51,542
Except when they cry. They try to hide it, but I always see them.

760
01:14:55,455 --> 01:14:59,415
Can I pet Waffle? - You bet you can pet Waffle.

761
01:15:00,446 --> 01:15:02,502
Are you gonna have a good Thanksgiving, Mr Cohen?

762
01:15:04,014 --> 01:15:07,702
Yes, I am. Me and Waffle are gonna take a little trip to see my Mom, in St Louis.

763
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:11,550
I know where that is.

764
01:15:15,990 --> 01:15:19,782
That is super, Heather. That's exactly where it is. Now do me a favor, will you?

765
01:15:20,446 --> 01:15:24,582
And I'm gonna trust you to take a good care of my friend Waffle, all right? - Sure.

766
01:15:25,566 --> 01:15:27,607
And I will be right back.

767
01:15:28,885 --> 01:15:30,221
Hi Amanda. Shouldn't you be in your class?

768
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:34,469
All right. Come on, I'll walk you to your room.

769
01:15:35,877 --> 01:15:41,149
Why can't I be in your class, Mr Cohen? - Well, your father had to do what's best for you, Amanda.

770
01:15:42,581 --> 01:15:48,294
And you know what? You've got a great teacher. - Ok. See you later, Mr Cohen.

771
01:16:04,301 --> 01:16:10,341
Bastard. - Where did you learn those words, Thomas?

772
01:16:13,397 --> 01:16:15,903
You know you're not supposed to leave the calssroom without asking?

773
01:16:17,285 --> 01:16:21,887
Well, you're gonna clean that up. And you're on detention. No recess.

774
01:16:23,684 --> 01:16:26,709
But you do get an A for spelling.

775
01:16:28,005 --> 01:16:30,916
You can't read it if you don't open it, Thomas. - I hate reading.

776
01:16:34,710 --> 01:16:39,516
So do I. - You do? - Yeah. Reading is really hard for me.

777
01:16:42,085 --> 01:16:44,204
It's not hard for you. You're the teacher.

778
01:16:45,092 --> 01:16:46,972
You wanna bet? Let's play a game.

779
01:16:48,108 --> 01:16:52,932
You'll be Mr Cohen trying to read, and I'll be Tourette syndrome. Ok?

780
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:55,413
Read this page.

781
01:16:56,404 --> 01:16:58,956
Once upon - wha-wha! Keep reading.

782
01:17:01,179 --> 01:17:05,780
...upon a time there was a...- That itches! - Does that itch a little bit?

783
01:17:06,587 --> 01:17:09,979
All right, keep reading. - There was a..-Heeeyy, Thomas!

784
01:17:11,852 --> 01:17:13,219
All right, that's hard, isn't it? It's hard to concentrate.

785
01:17:14,204 --> 01:17:17,236
That's how hard reading is for me. It's not that hard for you, is it?

786
01:17:18,452 --> 01:17:23,419
No, it's easy for me. But how can you be a teacher if you hate books?

787
01:17:24,268 --> 01:17:31,067
Hate books? I don't hate books. Everything in the world is in books, I just have to work extra hard to get it out.

788
01:17:32,315 --> 01:17:34,427
I'm not gonna give up on you, buddy. Ok?

789
01:17:35,178 --> 01:17:37,227
And I'm not gonna let you give up on yourself. Now, keep reading, right here.

790
01:17:38,482 --> 01:17:48,683
Once upon a time, there was a mage..mage...- Magician. - a magician, who met a small boy.

791
01:17:49,586 --> 01:17:53,396
The small boy was trying to pull a big sword of a big rock.

792
01:17:54,795 --> 01:17:57,754
Weird. Why would a sword be in a rock?

793
01:17:59,363 --> 01:18:03,442
Well, I don't know. but if you keep reading, you might just find out.

794
01:18:04,539 --> 01:18:15,370
The magician told the small boy that whoever could pulll the sword out of the rock, wold be the true king. Cool.

795
01:18:16,714 --> 01:18:21,602
Keep going, what happens next?

796
01:18:51,695 --> 01:18:55,151
Hey, what's wrong? - I'm so nervous.

797
01:18:56,071 --> 01:18:57,985
What's there to be nervous about? You're just gonna meet my Mom.

798
01:18:58,969 --> 01:19:00,513
Thank you. That's helpful. - and Jeff.

799
01:19:02,308 --> 01:19:07,763
And my aunts and uncles. And anybody I've ever loved in my entire life.

800
01:19:11,435 --> 01:19:15,628
Prepare yourself. This is big. That's right. Prepare yourself.

801
01:19:21,076 --> 01:19:30,019
Oh, you're here! Oh, hii! I can't believe I'm finally seeing you. Nancy! You're even prettier than I thought.

802
01:19:31,107 --> 01:19:35,539
Brad has told me so much about you, Mrs Cohen. - Ellen. That's more than he tells me about you.

803
01:19:36,450 --> 01:19:39,067
What? I tell you all about Nancy. - Oh, you never tell me the real stuff.

804
01:19:39,803 --> 01:19:42,707
Come on, Nancy. Bobo, get the bag, honey. - Yes, Bobo, get on that.

805
01:19:43,962 --> 01:19:47,882
So, are you exhausted? -Because we have a pedicure appointment in an hour.

806
01:19:50,715 --> 01:19:57,482
This is Nancy, who I was telling you about. And...wait. Janice, come on, meet Nancy. - Hello, it's nice to meet you.

807
01:19:58,641 --> 01:20:01,026
Mom is going a little overboard trying to make Nancy feel like family.

808
01:20:01,779 --> 01:20:03,186
Is there a possibility her being family?

809
01:20:04,211 --> 01:20:08,610
I don't know. I mean, you know...I know, but I don't...I don't...

810
01:20:09,338 --> 01:20:13,113
Oh, that's serious. Has she met Dad? - No. nonononono...

811
01:20:14,146 --> 01:20:16,306
Well, what are you waiting for? -Hey, back off, will you?

812
01:20:20,063 --> 01:20:26,319
And then he hit his head straight against the curb. Gave himslef a concussion.

813
01:20:27,909 --> 01:20:33,006
Will you excuse me? Nancy is needed in the kitchen. I'm just gonna steal her for one second. - Needed in the kitchen...

814
01:20:36,710 --> 01:20:39,631
Are you rescuing me? Cause I don't need rescuing. - I do.

815
01:20:42,122 --> 01:20:44,521
What's going on? - How was your pedicure?

816
01:20:46,497 --> 01:20:51,507
If you're wondering what your Mom and I talked about - we talked about you. And us.

817
01:20:53,209 --> 01:20:58,648
Something wrong? - I was just wondering if I told you...

818
01:21:01,513 --> 01:21:08,193
I love you.

819
01:21:15,416 --> 01:21:17,552
I mean... It jsut scares me. Right?

820
01:21:18,704 --> 01:21:21,440
I never thought about it before. I never dared to think about it.

821
01:21:22,752 --> 01:21:30,007
Brad. She understands about your noises. She doesn't care.
You make her happy.

822
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:33,176
She told me that, Bard. You make her laugh.

823
01:21:34,984 --> 01:21:36,552
Well, what if one day she stops laughing?

824
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:44,881
What is one day she gets fed up of living with someone who...

825
01:21:54,904 --> 01:21:57,984
I just... I don't wanna hurt her, Mom.

826
01:21:59,681 --> 01:22:01,584
Maybe, you don't wanna get hurt.

827
01:22:07,272 --> 01:22:13,367
The only thing that can hurt either of you is if you let Tourette's drive her away from you.
If you let it win.

828
01:22:22,186 --> 01:22:27,178
Heather's mother had called to say Heather was no longer able to attend school.

829
01:22:28,210 --> 01:22:34,153
So the class all pitched in to cheer her up. - Wow, look at this table. Looks very good.

830
01:22:36,050 --> 01:22:38,458
Oh, this looks great over here.

831
01:22:51,033 --> 01:22:54,305
The news we'd always been dreading came a few weeks later.

832
01:23:23,449 --> 01:23:28,392
Sir! They are about to start the service. - You go ahead.

833
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:39,064
Mr Cohen. Aren't you coming in?

834
01:23:40,121 --> 01:23:45,561
I'm sorry. I thought I could, but I...I think I'd be too disruptive.

835
01:23:47,481 --> 01:23:52,187
You made such a huge difference in Heater's life. You were her favorite teacher.

836
01:23:53,959 --> 01:23:57,944
Please, don't leave without saying good bye to her.

837
01:25:00,312 --> 01:25:09,824
Ok, Thomas, what is your team's word? - Weird.  -Weird.
Anybody not on Thomas's team knows what that word means?

838
01:25:10,792 --> 01:25:12,895
Strange. - Creepy. - Scary.

839
01:25:13,641 --> 01:25:18,217
Very good. Who can use the word "weird" in a sentence?

840
01:25:19,297 --> 01:25:23,761
Me, me! - Twenty five, thirty, thirty five, forty - Gailain!

841
01:25:25,993 --> 01:25:31,504
I like weird movies. Sorry, Mr cohen, I know you can't go to them,
'cause you get thrown out of the movie theatre.

842
01:25:32,618 --> 01:25:36,473
Well, that' ok, Gailain, 'cause I can rent movies. And I also like weird movies.

843
01:25:38,441 --> 01:25:41,665
So - weird is a good word, right? But what if someone comes up to you and they say

844
01:25:42,888 --> 01:25:46,144
Hey, you! Yeah, I'm talking to you - you're weird!

845
01:25:47,561 --> 01:25:50,210
Is it still a good word? - No!

846
01:25:53,376 --> 01:25:57,536
What's that? - Ok, everyone, stay in your seat.

847
01:25:59,048 --> 01:26:04,240
It's Maxine, on her Big Red! Mr Cohen, can we go see them?

848
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:09,953
Ok, but everyone - inside voices. No running.

849
01:26:33,948 --> 01:26:40,389
Exactly. Heely, get in there, man, all right? But be careful.

850
01:26:44,982 --> 01:26:52,645
So, what do you think of it? - Heely! What did I tel you? All right? No pulling horn!

851
01:26:53,861 --> 01:27:03,548
Sorry, Maxine! - That's all right. Kids will be kids! - Yeah, they will.

852
01:27:07,012 --> 01:27:12,677
They still get along? - Well, looks like it. - Give them time.

853
01:27:19,503 --> 01:27:24,375
I like Nancy. She reminds me of your mom when we first met. - They don't look anything alike.

854
01:27:25,391 --> 01:27:32,240
I'm not talking about looks. I'm talking about that...spark, you know?
That spirit. That je ne sais quoi (charm)

855
01:27:33,999 --> 01:27:34,959
How're things at school?

856
01:27:36,255 --> 01:27:44,055
You know..We got more books that bookcases, roof leaks...
still worried thay might not ask me back next year.

857
01:27:45,959 --> 01:27:47,895
There's plenty of teachers with a lot more experience than me.

858
01:27:49,825 --> 01:27:53,879
I'm proud of you regardless. - It doesn't feel that way.

859
01:27:55,622 --> 01:27:57,255
Why do I feel like you're still embarrased by me?

860
01:27:58,575 --> 01:28:01,335
And it's ok, Dad, you can admit it. - You're not trying to start something? -No.

861
01:28:02,391 --> 01:28:04,966
But, you know, we're talking, and it's good, so let's talk.

862
01:28:06,934 --> 01:28:08,230
I've always been an embarrassment to you.

863
01:28:09,526 --> 01:28:14,054
I have, haven't I? Even when you used to come visit me,
you used to squirm on all those eye-balls who clicked my way?

864
01:28:15,878 --> 01:28:17,502
You've never been able to accept it.

865
01:28:23,108 --> 01:28:29,244
You're right. It is tought being with you sometimes.

866
01:28:30,684 --> 01:28:35,452
I hate it when we go to restaurants and people give you those looks.
Sometimes I wanna just...

867
01:28:38,027 --> 01:28:42,277
I just feel so helpless.

868
01:28:43,643 --> 01:28:45,947
You know, I've always been a guy who could fix things.

869
01:28:46,884 --> 01:28:50,027
But the one thing I could never fix was the one hurting you most.-
I doesn't need fixing!

870
01:28:51,034 --> 01:28:52,531
Nobody can fix it!

871
01:28:53,621 --> 01:28:56,227
I know. I know.

872
01:28:59,011 --> 01:29:08,403
But maybe it's my fault. Maybe I gave it to you.

873
01:29:14,731 --> 01:29:18,907
I think these babies are done...

874
01:29:21,882 --> 01:29:25,275
Come on, guys, we onlygot two minutes till the media center closes. Just hurry up back there.

875
01:29:26,434 --> 01:29:27,610
Stay to the side, guys, stay to the side, what did I tell you?

876
01:29:28,818 --> 01:29:30,314
Guys in the back, come on, hurry up!

877
01:29:32,379 --> 01:29:38,522
Dad! What are you doing here? - You said you needed bookshelves, didn't you?

878
01:29:39,980 --> 01:29:45,355
Your father's built these new bookshelves for the library. - Things are a little slow at the office.

879
01:29:47,826 --> 01:29:52,211
This way, gentlemen. - Oh, I got you something for your collection.

880
01:29:58,362 --> 01:30:00,706
Put it on, Mr Cohen.

881
01:30:04,107 --> 01:30:09,634
A hard hat for an extremely hard head.

882
01:30:12,178 --> 01:30:20,330
Hey, class, that's my Dad. - Hi, Mr Cohen! - Hi! - Come on.

883
01:30:25,752 --> 01:30:28,249
And Hillary didn't say what this was about? - No idea.

884
01:30:29,689 --> 01:30:34,073
We were at recess and she said she needs to see you in the classroom. -
I think it might be about next year.

885
01:30:38,841 --> 01:30:43,672
Here he is. Brad! Come over here a minute, please.

886
01:30:45,409 --> 01:30:47,128
Hillary has got an announcement to make.

887
01:30:48,553 --> 01:30:52,593
Some of you may've noticed an observer hanging around school for the last few weeks.

888
01:30:53,649 --> 01:30:58,209
Well, he was here to assess one of our teachers. Mr Cohen.

889
01:31:00,857 --> 01:31:11,193
And I'm here to announce that our very own Brad Cohen
has been chosen from amongst all the new educators in the state of Georgia

890
01:31:11,736 --> 01:31:17,666
to be Sally Maze First year Teacher of the Year.

891
01:31:23,418 --> 01:31:25,682
As I looked at my students, I felt like a kid inside.

892
01:31:26,921 --> 01:31:29,690
Because children look at life differently that most adults.

893
01:31:30,633 --> 01:31:36,570
They see the world and say "I will", not "I can't". And so did I.

894
01:31:45,627 --> 01:31:49,610
The shirt is too tight, the label is digging into my back. - I cut out the label.
I don't know what you are so nervous about.

895
01:31:51,032 --> 01:31:55,191
You're in front of the crowd every day. - Well, these aren't second graders.

896
01:31:55,226 --> 01:32:03,105
Oh, man. I wish I was invisible. - That's something you will never have to worry about.
Hold still, hold still!

897
01:32:04,664 --> 01:32:07,609
I love you.

898
01:32:40,652 --> 01:32:45,725
Come on, Bobo, you can get through this. - Don't worry, he's gonna get through it.

899
01:32:48,581 --> 01:32:53,821
The noise you just heard is the Tourette syndrome I've been living with since I was 6 years old.

900
01:32:56,637 --> 01:33:01,988
I'm standing up here today because the love and support of plenty of people put me up here.

901
01:33:03,405 --> 01:33:10,645
My family. My school family. My students. And all my friends.

902
01:33:12,404 --> 01:33:13,477
I owe this award to all of them.

903
01:33:14,717 --> 01:33:19,887
But I also owe it to the toughest and the most dedicated teacher I ever had.

904
01:33:20,973 --> 01:33:22,924
My constant companion. My Tourette's.

905
01:33:28,484 --> 01:33:30,884
Now, some of you may thinks that's pretty weird to thank a disability.

906
01:33:31,900 --> 01:33:37,349
And calling it a great teacher - that's really weird. I mean - what can I possibly learn form a disability?

907
01:33:43,044 --> 01:33:50,092
Yes, Kewin. - You learned to keep going.

908
01:33:56,445 --> 01:33:59,861
Heely? - You learned not to let it stop you.

909
01:34:05,051 --> 01:34:07,779
Yes, Thomas. - You learned not to let it win.

910
01:34:09,315 --> 01:34:12,003
That's right.

911
01:34:14,459 --> 01:34:18,354
Coping with my tourette's has taught me the most valuable lesson anyone can ever learn.

912
01:34:20,163 --> 01:34:24,124
and that is: to never let anything stop you from chasing your dream.

913
01:34:25,466 --> 01:34:35,714
From working or playing, falling in love...That's right.

914
01:34:36,924 --> 01:34:42,085
Coping with my Tourette's has taught me the most valuable lesson

915
01:34:43,700 --> 01:34:48,989
Yes, Thomas? - Can you bring that award to the "Show and Tell" on Monday?

916
01:34:56,563 --> 01:35:01,060
You bet.
