00:31:02.611 --> 00:31:04.196
Yes.

2
00:31:04.279 --> 00:31:08.617
Because every day I thought about you.

3
00:31:27.052 --> 00:31:29.972
Not nearly as beautiful as you.

4
01:01:57.506 --> 01:02:00.509
I hope your husband goes to Scotland

5
01:02:01.218 --> 01:02:03.970
and meets Wallace...

6
01:02:04.388 --> 01:02:07.057
and then you'll be a widow.

7
01:06:00.749 --> 01:06:04.336
When the king returns,
he will bury them in those new clothes.

8
01:06:04.711 --> 01:06:06.713
Scotland is in chaos.

9
01:06:07.213 --> 01:06:10.342
Your husband is secretly
sending an army north.

10
01:06:10.425 --> 01:06:12.010
How do you know this?

11
01:06:12.719 --> 01:06:16.473
Last night I slept with a member
of the War Council.

12
01:06:16.556 --> 01:06:19.059
He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.

13
01:06:19.267 --> 01:06:20.268
Ah, yes.

14
01:06:20.352 --> 01:06:23.021
Englishmen don't know
what a tongue is for.

15
01:06:27.901 --> 01:06:30.153
This Scottish rebel... Wallace?

16
01:06:30.236 --> 01:06:31.863
He fights to avenge a woman?

17
01:06:31.946 --> 01:06:33.698
I nearly forgot.

18
01:06:33.782 --> 01:06:36.743
A magistrate wished to capture him,

19
01:06:36.826 --> 01:06:39.537
and found he had a secret lover.

20
01:06:42.624 --> 01:06:46.211
So he cut the girl's throat
to tempt Wallace to fight...

21
01:06:46.503 --> 01:06:48.213
and fight he did.

22
01:06:49.172 --> 01:06:55.345
Knowing his passion for his lost love,
they next plotted to take him

23
01:06:55.428 --> 01:06:59.474
by desecrating the graves
of his father and brother

24
01:06:59.933 --> 01:07:03.603
and setting an ambush
at the grave of his love.

25
01:07:05.063 --> 01:07:08.692
He fought his way through the trap

26
01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:13.697
and carried her body to a secret place.

27
01:07:18.618 --> 01:07:20.745
Now that's love, no?

28
01:07:21.246 --> 01:07:23.248
Love?

29
01:07:25.375 --> 01:07:26.793
I wouldn't know.

30
01:47:52.633 --> 01:47:55.136
He is a bloody murdering savage.

31
01:47:55.219 --> 01:47:57.263
And he's telling lies.

32
01:47:57.346 --> 01:47:59.515
I never lie.

33
01:48:02.309 --> 01:48:04.270
But I am a savage.

34
01:48:07.398 --> 01:48:09.608
Or in French if you prefer?
