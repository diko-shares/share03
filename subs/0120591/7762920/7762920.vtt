00:14:46.994 --> 00:14:48.369
on near-Earth object collision.

358
00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:50.872
Okay? Any ideas, any programs,

359
00:14:50.873 --> 00:14:52.577
anything you sketched
on a pizza box...

360
00:14:52.609 --> 00:14:54.000
...or cocktail napkin.

361
00:14:54.001 --> 00:14:56.085
For 30 years,
they questioned the need for NASA.

362
00:14:56.086 --> 00:14:57.521
Today, we're gonna give 'em
the answer.

363
00:15:01.217 --> 00:15:02.623
You know about this, Rockhound?

364
00:15:03.429 --> 00:15:04.622
- You knew?
- No.

365
00:15:05.022 --> 00:15:06.256
I had no idea.

366
00:15:07.723 --> 00:15:08.730
Where's Harry?

367
00:15:09.975 --> 00:15:11.763
Harry, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

368
00:15:11.795 --> 00:15:13.272
I understand, okay?

369
00:15:13.305 --> 00:15:14.480
- You're mad.
- (GUN COCKS)

370
00:15:14.513 --> 00:15:15.615
Who wouldn't be mad?

371
00:15:15.648 --> 00:15:16.685
He's gonna shoot you.

372
00:15:16.718 --> 00:15:17.732
Nah, no, he's not.

373
00:15:17.733 --> 00:15:18.468
Oh, shit.

374
00:15:18.891 --> 00:15:19.898
Whoa!

375
00:15:20.655 --> 00:15:21.647
Aah!

376
00:15:21.946 --> 00:15:23.102
Harry!

377
00:15:23.586 --> 00:15:24.989
What's wrong with you?

378
00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:27.075
Make your peace with God, A.J.!

379
00:15:27.076 --> 00:15:29.452
This guy's got a gun, man.
He's shooting at me.

380
00:15:29.453 --> 00:15:31.246
Harry, this is not funny!

381
00:15:31.247 --> 00:15:32.520
Harry, listen to me!

382
00:15:32.565 --> 00:15:33.790
We can talk this over!

383
00:15:33.791 --> 00:15:35.556
Oh, is this a serious thing?

384
00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:36.861
Yeah, pretty serious.

385
00:15:37.169 --> 00:15:38.419
- Bear!
- What's up?

386
00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:40.839
He's shootin' at me. You see Harry
comin', crack him with that wrench.

387
00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.668
You told A.J.'s dad
just before he died...

388
00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:44.133
...that you would
take care of the boy.

389
00:15:44.134 --> 00:15:46.511
Now I'm not sure that
shootin' him is takin' care of him.

390
00:15:46.512 --> 00:15:47.679
Why don't you put the gun down?

391
00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.639
You don't want none of this.
Get out of my way.

392
00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.933
Just tryin' to give my man
a head start, that's all.

393
00:15:51.934 --> 00:15:53.268
Not to mention the fact that I don't think

394
00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:54.936
you wanna kill
the best man on your crew,

395
00:15:54.937 --> 00:15:55.973
before we strike oil.

396
00:15:56.005 --> 00:15:57.438
Aw, Chick, I ain't
gonna kill him.

397
00:15:57.439 --> 00:15:58.537
Just gonna take a foot off.

398
00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:00.243
A man can work with one foot.

399
00:16:00.276 --> 00:16:02.052
You remember old
Frank Marx who worked...

400
00:16:02.084 --> 00:16:03.278
...with one hand
all them years?

401
00:16:03.279 --> 00:16:04.571
Yeah, but he wasn't very good.

402
00:16:04.572 --> 00:16:07.407
Harry, put the gun down!
You're acting insane!

403
00:16:07.408 --> 00:16:09.150
Now, honey, go get
some clothes on...

404
00:16:09.183 --> 00:16:10.034
...and get out of the way.

405
00:16:10.035 --> 00:16:11.739
You can't control my life!

406
00:16:12.056 --> 00:16:13.070
Fine.

407
00:16:13.103 --> 00:16:14.507
Clothes. Now!

408
00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:15.540
All right, stop! All right!

409
00:16:15.541 --> 00:16:17.548
It was funny for a minute.
It's not funny anymore.

Harry, this is illegal, man.

412
00:16:22.548 --> 00:16:24.541
I'm temporarily insane,

- Well...

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:33.808
Harry! Hey, just cool down.

416
00:16:33.809 --> 00:16:36.394
What are you doing?
Harry, stop! Cut it out.

417
00:16:36.395 --> 00:16:38.479
- All right, Harry.
- All right, now, listen.

418
00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.378
Man to man. I'm serious.

419
00:16:41.604 --> 00:16:43.698
- I love her.
- Way wrong answer!

420

Aah! Aah!

421
00:16:46.989 --> 00:16:48.483
- Whoa, whoa, Harry. It's gettin' real.
- Harry!

422
00:16:48.515 --> 00:16:49.824
Come on, Harry!

423
00:16:49.825 --> 00:16:51.621
- You shot me!
- You shot him.

424
00:16:52.536 --> 00:16:54.495
That bullet never got close.
Just a ricochet.

425
00:16:54.496 --> 00:16:57.040
You know, it's all funny
till somebody gets shot in the leg!

...In 1974,

430
00:17:05.507 --> 00:17:07.133
(STAMMERS)
we first got the idea

431
00:17:07.134 --> 00:17:09.093
the-the possibility
that-that a meteor or an asteroid...

432
00:17:09.094 --> 00:17:10.920
I need somebody who's
had a little less caffeine...

433
00:17:10.952 --> 00:17:11.930
...this morning. Doc, translate.

434
00:17:11.931 --> 00:17:14.596
Yes, sir. Our first
feasibility plan was...

435
00:17:14.628 --> 00:17:16.731
...to use a spread-focus
laser generator

436
00:17:16.936 --> 00:17:18.978
to heat the object
to the point of fracture.

437
00:17:18.979 --> 00:17:21.606
That's like shooting a B.B. gun
at a freight train, Doc.

438
00:17:21.607 --> 00:17:23.316
Uh, some of us have got this idea.

439
00:17:23.317 --> 00:17:24.853
We wanna land a craft...

440

...deploy solar sails.

441
00:17:26.904 --> 00:17:28.732
You'll have a big canopy.

00:17:35.645 --> 00:17:37.538
We gotta come up with
something realistic here!

446

GRACE: Listen,
Harry, A.J. is my choice.

453
00:17:50.803 --> 00:17:52.387
My choice and not yours.

454
00:17:52.388 --> 00:17:54.389
He's the only one in
your age bracket, Grace.

455
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:56.391
It's not a choice. It's a lack of options.

456
00:17:56.392 --> 00:17:58.285
GRACE: I don't know
what in the world...

457
00:17:58.313 --> 00:17:58.935
...makes you think

458
00:17:58.936 --> 00:18:01.646
that you have the right to tell
me what to do anymore, Harry.

459
00:18:01.647 --> 00:18:03.690
I suppose being your father
doesn't count, huh?

460
00:18:03.691 --> 00:18:05.566
- Not really.
- Since when?

461
00:18:05.567 --> 00:18:08.903
Since I reached the age of ten
and became older than you, Harry.

462
00:18:08.904 --> 00:18:11.280
Since Mom split.
Why don't you take your pick?

463
00:18:11.281 --> 00:18:13.908
Look, I understand that
you are handicapped

464
00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:16.703
by natural immaturity, and I forgive you.

465
00:18:16.704 --> 00:18:19.706
I may be an immature father,
but I'm still your employer.

466
00:18:19.707 --> 00:18:21.749
And as your boss,
I want you on that crew boat tonight

467
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:22.959
and back in the office by Monday.

468
00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.038

469
00:18:24.217 --> 00:18:25.795
Okay. I quit.

Rockhound had to take me
into Taipei for Tampax

484
00:18:52.823 --> 00:18:55.199
and then he had to show me
how to use 'em, Harry.

her how to use it.

487
00:18:59.721 --> 00:19:01.489

488
00:19:02.374 --> 00:19:04.500

playing with dolls.

General, if you consider your target,

510
00:19:44.792 --> 00:19:47.543
her composition, her dimensions,

511
00:19:47.544 --> 00:19:49.462
her sheer velocity,

512
00:19:49.463 --> 00:19:51.172

you've got on her,

513
00:19:51.173 --> 00:19:52.969

and keep on coming.

And, in a situation like this...

520
00:20:07.314 --> 00:20:08.898

don't wanna take the advice

a C-minus in astrophysics.

522
00:20:12.694 --> 00:20:14.537

523
00:20:14.891 --> 00:20:15.896
...wrong.

00:20:16.522 --> 00:20:17.537
I'm right.

...in the palm of your hand.

00:20:23.497 --> 00:20:24.989
You set it off. What happens?

529
00:20:26.043 --> 00:20:27.293

me because somebody...

...told you I was the best.

709
00:27:14.991 --> 00:27:17.349

because I work with the best.

some kind of backup plan, right?

Neil Armstrong, 1969,
bouncing on the moon.

1080
00:41:53.494 --> 00:41:56.704
He's bouncing up there because there's
less gravity up there than on Earth.

1081
00:41:56.705 --> 00:42:00.333
This will be similar
to the asteroid, so watch it.

1082

Something gets launched off
that asteroid with enough force,

1083
00:42:03.045 --> 00:42:05.547
it's gonna keep on going
right into outer space.

1084
00:42:05.548 --> 00:42:09.426
What is the deal?
Is it just me, or is Watts really hot?

1085
00:42:09.427 --> 00:42:11.177
Yeah.

1086
00:42:11.178 --> 00:42:15.223
We have these new generation suits
with directional accelerant thrusters.

1087
00:42:15.224 --> 00:42:17.308
- You won't bounce like Neil Armstrong.
- Yeah, think so?

Then the oxygen will be sucked
out of this vacuum,

1099

Okay, gentlemen,
so here's the flight plan.

1103
00:43:12.072 --> 00:43:15.533
Now let's keep the laughter to
a minimum. I know this is not to scale.

1104
00:43:15.534 --> 00:43:20.163
Both shuttles will take off
Tuesday at 6:30 p.m.

1105
00:43:20.164 --> 00:43:22.415
Now 67 minutes later,

1106
00:43:22.416 --> 00:43:24.751
you're gonna dock with
the Russian space station

1107
00:43:24.752 --> 00:43:26.711
to meet cosmonaut Andropov,

1108
00:43:26.712 --> 00:43:29.756
who will refuel the shuttles
with liquid O2.

1109
00:43:29.757 --> 00:43:32.592
That's your fuel. Then you'll release

1110
00:43:32.593 --> 00:43:35.470
and take a 60-hour trip
toward the moon.

1111
00:43:35.471 --> 00:43:39.390
Now we only have one shot
of landing on this rock,

1112
00:43:39.391 --> 00:43:43.186
and that's precisely when
the asteroid passes by the moon.

1113
00:43:43.187 --> 00:43:46.606
You'll then use lunar gravity
and burn your thrusters,

1114
00:43:46.607 --> 00:43:49.609
slingshotting you around the moon,

1115
00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:52.111
coming up behind the asteroid.

1116
00:43:52.112 --> 00:43:55.448
- You'll be upward of 11 Gs.
- Yeah, I remember this one.

1117
00:43:55.449 --> 00:43:58.785
It's where the coyote sat
his ass down in a slingshot

1118
00:43:58.786 --> 00:44:01.079
and he strapped himself
to an Acme rocket.

1119
00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:04.123
- Is... Is that what we're doin' here?
- Rockhound.

1120
00:44:04.124 --> 00:44:07.043
No, no, really, because it didn't
work out too well for the coyote, Harry.

1121
00:44:07.044 --> 00:44:08.295
(OVERLAPPING CHATTERING)

1122
00:44:08.796 --> 00:44:11.994
Actually, we have a lot
better rockets than the coyote.

1123
00:44:13.342 --> 00:44:17.720
Now when you've finished
your Road Runner thrust move,

1124
00:44:17.721 --> 00:44:21.432
you'll be moving at
22,500 miles per hour.

1125
00:44:21.433 --> 00:44:23.810
Coming around behind the asteroid,

1126
00:44:23.811 --> 00:44:26.980
where we're hoping that the tail debris
will be cleared by the moon's gravity.

1127
00:44:26.981 --> 00:44:29.232
And you'll land right here. That's it.

1128
00:44:29.233 --> 00:44:31.526
We got separate landing sites
for each team.

1129
00:44:31.527 --> 00:44:33.778
Softest parts of the rock
as we can figure.

1130
00:44:33.779 --> 00:44:37.365
At NASA, we don't take chances.
We double up on everything.

1131
00:44:37.366 --> 00:44:40.326
First team that hits 800 feet wins.

1132
00:44:40.327 --> 00:44:44.205
Now this rock is big, dense. It's got
some gravity. You can walk around,

1133
00:44:44.206 --> 00:44:47.083
but use your thrusters
so you can work easier.

1134
00:44:47.084 --> 00:44:51.129
Okay, Mr. Truman, let's say
that we actually do land on this.

1135
00:44:51.130 --> 00:44:53.339
What's it gonna be like up there?

1136
00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:56.843
Two hundred degrees in the sunlight.
Minus 200 in the shade.

1137
00:44:56.844 --> 00:45:01.514
Canyons of razor-sharp rock.
Unpredictable gravitational conditions.

1138
00:45:01.515 --> 00:45:04.851
Unexpected eruptions. Things like that.

1139
00:45:04.852 --> 00:45:08.187
Okay, so the scariest
environment imaginable. Thanks.

1140
00:45:08.188 --> 00:45:10.315
That's all you gotta say,
scariest environment imaginable.

1141
00:45:10.316 --> 00:45:14.319
Okay, so you drill,
you drop the nuke and you leave.

1142
00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:16.029
Now here's the key.

1143
00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:18.740
You're gonna remote detonate the bomb

1144
00:45:18.741 --> 00:45:21.767
before the asteroid
passes this plane,

1145
00:45:21.896 --> 00:45:23.209
zero barrier.

1146
00:45:23.871 --> 00:45:24.881
You do that,

1147
00:45:25.139 --> 00:45:27.081
and the remaining
pieces of rock

1148
00:45:27.082 --> 00:45:29.582
should be deflected enough
to pass right by us.

1149
00:45:30.489 --> 00:45:33.183
Now if the bomb explodes
after zero barrier,

1150
00:45:37.217 --> 00:45:38.301
game's over.

- SHARP: By all means.
- The reason we were shooting for grid 8

2073
01:30:43.046 --> 01:30:45.974
is because thermographics
indicated that grid 9

2074

her rotation was stable
at 32 degrees on an x axis.

The lunar gravity's put her in a spin.

from them again.

2235
01:38:30.985 --> 01:38:32.180
for an additional five.

2236
01:38:32.181 --> 01:38:34.390
What he's trying to say, General,
is that, uh, in 12 minutes' time,

2237
01:38:34.391 --> 01:38:35.861
you may lose the ability

2238
01:38:35.889 --> 01:38:38.102
to detonate the
nuke... permanently.

2239
01:38:38.103 --> 01:38:40.268
I've got to inform the president.

2240
01:38:41.565 --> 01:38:42.932
Just want to make
sure you know

2241
01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:44.234
we're stuck on an asteroid.

2242
01:38:44.235 --> 01:38:46.236
- Do you know what you're doing now?
- No, no.

2243
01:38:46.237 --> 01:38:49.614
You know what? I have no idea
what I'm doing. I have no idea.

2244
01:38:49.615 --> 01:38:51.991
This button,
I don't know what that does, okay?

2245
01:38:51.992 --> 01:38:54.619
All I know is
that we just crashed back there,

2246
01:38:54.620 --> 01:38:57.580
I lost two of my friends,
we're 25 miles from Harry's shuttle.

2247
01:38:57.581 --> 01:39:00.083
We don't know if he's alive.
We don't know if he can fly.

2248
01:39:00.084 --> 01:39:01.876
All I know is,
there's a beep on this thing

2249
01:39:01.877 --> 01:39:03.636
and I'm trying to get us there.

2250
01:39:10.678 --> 01:39:11.761
[Beeping]

2251
01:39:11.762 --> 01:39:14.123
Let's get it unpacked.

2252
01:39:14.890 --> 01:39:15.932
What's up?

2253
01:39:15.933 --> 01:39:17.097
We're drilling through some

2254
01:39:17.125 --> 01:39:18.726
kind of metal I've
never seen before.

2255
01:39:18.727 --> 01:39:20.066
It's fried two
of our drill bits,

2256
01:39:20.094 --> 01:39:21.771
and now we blew
our first transmission.

2257
01:39:21.772 --> 01:39:22.856
So how deep are we?

2258
01:39:22.857 --> 01:39:24.649
We could use your help
with the transmission, Colonel.

2259
01:39:24.650 --> 01:39:26.137
I have an assessment
report due now.

2260
01:39:26.165 --> 01:39:27.610
We're supposed
to be at 200 feet.

2261
01:39:27.611 --> 01:39:30.446
- So how deep are we?
- Not as deep as we'll be

2262
01:39:30.447 --> 01:39:32.031
when you quit askin' me
these questions

2263
01:39:32.032 --> 01:39:33.700
and help us load this transmission on.

2264
01:39:33.701 --> 01:39:35.034
What is our current depth?

2265
01:39:35.035 --> 01:39:36.911
Our current depth
is not important, Colonel.

2266
01:39:36.912 --> 01:39:38.462
I'll decide
what's important.

2267
01:39:38.490 --> 01:39:40.039
We've got
800 feet to drill.

2268
01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:42.466
You've had two
and a half hours.

2269
01:39:42.494 --> 01:39:43.582
Where are we?

2270
01:39:44.753 --> 01:39:46.622
We're at 57 feet.

2271
01:39:46.964 --> 01:39:48.047
Now, if you're not too busy,

2272
01:39:48.048 --> 01:39:50.425
maybe you can give us a hand
with this transmission.

2273
01:39:50.426 --> 01:39:52.246
Colonel Sharp!

2274
01:39:53.095 --> 01:39:55.113
Get this strapped up.
I'll be right back.

2275
01:39:55.141 --> 01:39:55.889
Colonel Sharp!

2276
01:39:55.890 --> 01:39:57.776
All right. I'm coming through.

2277
01:39:57.804 --> 01:39:59.183
We have contact. Over.

2278
01:39:59.184 --> 01:40:02.234
That's as clear as it's gonna get.

2279
01:40:02.521 --> 01:40:04.814

at this moment.

- Transmission change.
- Colonel!

2282
01:40:08.819 --> 01:40:11.571
Twenty minutes.
Puts drilling final at ten hours.

2283
01:40:11.572 --> 01:40:15.158
Please advise. That's four hours
past the zero barrier. Please advise.

2284
01:40:15.159 --> 01:40:18.161
What the hell is this? "Zero depth"?

2285
01:40:18.162 --> 01:40:20.997
And where'd this come from?
Who are you talkin' to? Is that Truman?

2286
01:40:20.998 --> 01:40:22.498
Lemme have that phone.
Gimme the phone.

2287
01:40:22.499 --> 01:40:25.543
Truman! Look, this is what happens
when you drill.

2288
01:40:25.544 --> 01:40:27.699
We cannot use
your "U.S. Air Force

2289
01:40:27.727 --> 01:40:29.881

drill time card.

2290
01:40:29.882 --> 01:40:32.091
- Who wrote this thing, by the way?
- We're losing coms again.

2291
01:40:32.092 --> 01:40:34.385
Look. Is he getting this?
Does he hear me or...

2292
01:40:34.386 --> 01:40:35.803
- What's wrong with this?
- The com's down.

2293
01:40:35.804 --> 01:40:36.846
What do you mean, "the com's down"?

2294
01:40:36.847 --> 01:40:38.264
SHARP: What do I mean?
I mean we've lost

2295
01:40:38.265 --> 01:40:39.891
- communication to mission control.
- Fine.

2296
01:40:39.892 --> 01:40:41.935
Let's go back to the cargo bay
and get the transmission...

2297
01:40:41.936 --> 01:40:45.355
Harry, guess what. You had your shot.
You didn't do it. You understand me?

2298
01:40:45.356 --> 01:40:47.190
- You can't...
- Why don't you stay here...

men are the biggest

Oh, God.

2307

We're not lookin'
too good right now.

2308
01:41:11.492 --> 01:41:12.678
No shit.

2309
01:41:13.133 --> 01:41:15.150
We gotta get that radio back up.

2310
01:41:17.221 --> 01:41:20.515
MAN: Mr. President,
it's time to make a decision.

2311
01:41:20.516 --> 01:41:22.775
We can remote
detonate the bomb

2312
01:41:22.803 --> 01:41:25.061

five minutes.

2315
01:41:30.859 --> 01:41:33.270
Yes, we saw that, too, sir.

2316
01:41:33.570 --> 01:41:36.719
But maybe we should wait until they...

2317
01:41:42.663 --> 01:41:46.451
Dan, get them out of there.

2318
01:41:46.709 --> 01:41:49.168
- Evac right now.
- What's goin' on here?

2319
01:41:49.169 --> 01:41:51.087

to override the system.

Secondary protocol.

2323
01:42:10.399 --> 01:42:13.499
But they haven't drilled
the damn hole yet!

2324
01:42:17.281 --> 01:42:19.532
The president's advisors feel
that the drilling isn't working.

2325
01:42:19.533 --> 01:42:21.492
And we've lost radio contact,
maybe for good.

2326
01:42:21.493 --> 01:42:22.618
We've only got a few minutes left of

01:42:22.619 --> 01:42:24.829
guaranteed ability to
remote detonate that nuke.

2328
01:42:24.830 --> 01:42:27.415
If we don't do it now we could lose
control, and we may never get it back.

2329
01:42:27.416 --> 01:42:28.887
Well, you tell
the president that

2330
01:42:28.915 --> 01:42:30.710
he better fire his
so-called advisors.

2331
01:42:30.711 --> 01:42:32.295
If you detonate that nuke on the surface,

2332
01:42:32.296 --> 01:42:34.088
we waste a perfectly good bomb,

2333
01:42:34.089 --> 01:42:36.007

to save this planet!

2335
01:42:46.977 --> 01:42:48.797

everything you got now!

2338
01:42:55.694 --> 01:42:57.487
Yes, Mr. President,
I understand that completely,

2339
01:42:57.488 --> 01:42:59.614
but my point is very, very simple.

2340
01:42:59.615 --> 01:43:00.985
And I think you need
to trust me on this

2341
01:43:01.013 --> 01:43:02.241

something about it.

2342
01:43:02.242 --> 01:43:03.655
I guarantee you,

2343
01:43:03.683 --> 01:43:06.523
if you do this,
you kill us all.

Watsler, are you listening? It's Truman.

2404
01:45:14.958 --> 01:45:16.808
Okay, listen
to me carefully.

2405
01:45:16.836 --> 01:45:19.484
I want you to kill it.
Kill the uplink.

2406
01:45:30.307 --> 01:45:32.892
Give us the time, Sharp.
Shut this bomb down now!

2407
01:45:32.893 --> 01:45:34.560
- It's not my call.
- Then whose call is it?

2408
01:45:34.561 --> 01:45:36.646
An order to detonate can
only come from the president.

2409
01:45:36.647 --> 01:45:38.272
- The president's not here!
- Let's just turn it off now.

2410

You've gotta give us more time!

2411

I'm telling you to
shut this bomb down now!

2412

And I'm telling you it's not my call!

2413
01:45:42.486 --> 01:45:44.487
Well, guess what.
I just made the call for you.

2415
01:45:47.824 --> 01:45:50.993
Don't. You could set it off.

2416
01:45:50.994 --> 01:45:52.038
Oh, man.

2417
01:45:52.066 --> 01:45:55.225

- Easy.

our job the right way.

I'm under orders to protect
a surface detonation.

2427

I'm gonna give you three seconds
to shut this bomb down,

2428
01:46:18.272 --> 01:46:20.436
and then I'm gonna make you shoot me.

2429
