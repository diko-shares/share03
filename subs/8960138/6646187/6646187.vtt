I think I watched with my dad.

22
00:05:53.112 --> 00:05:56.215
I've got a pair of welder

23
00:05:57.083 --> 00:05:58.583
I could lend them to you.

No.

25
00:05:59.885 --> 00:06:03.723
Welded glasses are for solar
eclipses, not lunar eclipses.

26
00:06:03.756 --> 00:06:05.825
And they're not that great
anyway

27
00:06:05.858 --> 00:06:07.994
because of the double
refraction.

28
00:06:08.794 --> 00:06:09.962
The double what?

29
00:06:09.996 --> 00:06:11.964

Seven letters has my name.

are nothing without fear.

108
00:13:38.177 --> 00:13:41.413
Anyway,
I'm on this pig, massive.

109
00:13:41.447 --> 00:13:44.149
So, I was grabbing it by his
ears and we started riding

110
00:13:44.183 --> 00:13:46.084
and all I hear the whole time...

[imitating pig squealing]

112
00:13:48.053 --> 00:13:50.522

114
00:13:51.658 --> 00:13:53.192
- ...and then Chris...
- A... a whole herd of them?

115
00:13:53.225 --> 00:13:54.694
A whole herd of them.
And Chris' chick...

116
00:13:54.727 --> 00:13:59.298
Well, well, well, good evening.

117
00:14:02.769 --> 00:14:04.136
Sit down.

118
00:14:05.304 --> 00:14:08.407
Just stay calm, guys, okay?
He's not going to hurt us.

119
00:14:09.074 --> 00:14:10.375
Wrong answer.

120
00:14:11.043 --> 00:14:15.347
From now on,
you just sit down and you drive.

121
00:14:16.615 --> 00:14:18.718
I should be doing the talking
from now on.

122
00:14:19.384 --> 00:14:20.252
Got that kids?

123
00:14:23.455 --> 00:14:25.257
I can't hear you. You got it?

124
00:14:26.124 --> 00:14:27.326
- Got it.
- Got it.

125
00:14:27.694 --> 00:14:28.560
[Pedro] Good.

126
00:14:34.533 --> 00:14:35.635
Obedient, too.

127
00:14:39.104 --> 00:14:42.274
You, there.

128
00:14:44.142 --> 00:14:45.244
You...

129
00:14:47.346 --> 00:14:48.480

[jarring indication]

131
00:14:56.321 --> 00:14:57.322

[chuckling]

133
00:15:04.664 --> 00:15:05.765
That was him.

134
00:15:05.798 --> 00:15:11.270
Mark, he was trying to kiss her
and she was screaming.

135
00:15:11.303 --> 00:15:17.209
So, I go,
"Hey, leave her alone."

136
00:15:18.343 --> 00:15:20.546
And then he turns around
with a stupid little face

137
00:15:20.579 --> 00:15:24.784
and goes, "Karl,
the canteen's over that way."

138
00:15:25.685 --> 00:15:27.553
And he was with his friends,
there was like seven of them.

139
00:15:27.586 --> 00:15:29.521
Yeah,
but I bet that didn't scare you.

140
00:15:30.188 --> 00:15:31.256
Of course, it didn't.

141
00:15:32.391 --> 00:15:34.661
I slide tag with him and
kick them straight in the balls,

142
00:15:34.694 --> 00:15:37.496
then I got up and hit the other
one with a backhand strike.

143
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:42.601
Yeah. The third managed to block
me, but I kicked down the fourth

144
00:15:42.635 --> 00:15:44.202
and pushed the third
on to the sixth.

145
00:15:44.236 --> 00:15:50.142
And the last one, well,
attacked him with a super boost

146
00:15:50.576 --> 00:15:56.181
just like a real wrestler,
letting chaos everywhere, KO,

147
00:15:56.548 --> 00:15:57.583
and the final kiss.

148
00:15:58.283 --> 00:16:01.286
- A super boost?
- Mm-hmm. Just like that.

149
00:16:03.422 --> 00:16:04.423
Sorry.

150
00:16:12.364 --> 00:16:15.100
- Is that him?
- Yes.

151
00:16:16.636 --> 00:16:19.404
We've been looking for this guy
everywhere.

152
00:16:20.305 --> 00:16:26.746
We really have to find him before he
claims other victims and eats more tongues.

153
00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:29.414
And I don't know what it is,

154
00:16:29.882 --> 00:16:32.685
but he just seems
to love teenagers.

155
00:16:34.486 --> 00:16:36.388
We've got that super boost,
right?

156
00:16:36.421 --> 00:16:37.356
[chuckles]

157
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:48.433
[ominous music playing]

158
00:16:53.773 --> 00:16:57.744
Now, if you could all
listen carefully,

159
00:16:58.678 --> 00:17:01.246
throw your fucking phones
out the windows.

160
00:17:07.285 --> 00:17:08.453
You, too.

161
00:17:08.988 --> 00:17:12.591
- Fuck you.
- Reg, do what he says.

162
00:17:12.624 --> 00:17:13.492
Sit.

163
00:17:17.262 --> 00:17:18.798
He's right, you know.

164
00:17:20.265 --> 00:17:22.401
No time for playing games.

165
00:17:22.434 --> 00:17:23.736
This gun is real.

166
00:17:24.469 --> 00:17:27.339
And I know what death
tastes like.

167
00:17:27.372 --> 00:17:31.243
It tastes delicious.

168
00:17:33.345 --> 00:17:35.682
[pants]
It's Pedro Minghella.

169
00:17:36.615 --> 00:17:38.685
The tongue eater.

170
00:17:38.718 --> 00:17:39.584
Who?

171
00:17:40.252 --> 00:17:41.821
The tongue eater.

172
00:17:42.487 --> 00:17:44.456
It's really,
I'm just fucked up, eh.

173
00:17:44.489 --> 00:17:47.526
Prison can be a very informative
experience.

174
00:17:47.559 --> 00:17:49.996
You should try it sometimes.

176
00:17:52.597 --> 00:17:53.565

177

Good boy.

[groans]

358
00:33:01.908 --> 00:33:04.242
A push won't fucking work.

359
00:33:04.276 --> 00:33:07.914
- Nothing is fucking working.
- We just need to deal with this ourselves, okay?

360
00:33:07.947 --> 00:33:10.917
Yeah, if we all work as a team,
we'll probably make it out of here alive.

361
00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:12.652
Fuck this.

362
00:33:12.685 --> 00:33:15.587
Fuck this. I don't need this.

363
00:33:16.421 --> 00:33:20.392
I just want to get off
this fucking bus and go home.

364
00:33:20.425 --> 00:33:22.561
That is what we all want,
Reggie.

Reggie, come on. Reggie.

377
00:35:15.407 --> 00:35:16.608
You hear me? Reggie.

378
00:35:16.642 --> 00:35:17.977
You okay?

Hurry up.

[Bess] Come on, let's go.
Go, go, go!

401
00:37:59.639 --> 00:38:01.841

[Nolan]
Hey, where are you going, Karl?

406
00:38:25.497 --> 00:38:26.699
What, would you rather
turn back?

407
00:38:26.732 --> 00:38:27.800
[Karl] Absolutely not.

408
00:38:27.833 --> 00:38:29.802
[Bess] Okay, look, we just need
to keep going, okay.

409
00:38:29.835 --> 00:38:30.870
[Nolan] Yeah.
We'll find somewhere safe.

410
00:38:30.903 --> 00:38:32.772
We've got a better chance
of getting out of here.

411
00:38:32.805 --> 00:38:33.739
[Bess] Yeah.

412
00:38:34.774 --> 00:38:38.744
[panting]

413
00:38:44.516 --> 00:38:48.553
- Yup, this place is fucking terrifying.
- Okay, just calm down.

414
00:38:48.586 --> 00:38:49.889
It's my worst nightmare.

415
00:38:53.225 --> 00:38:54.559
Fuck that.

416
00:38:56.996 --> 00:38:58.130
Fuck that.

417
00:39:01.267 --> 00:39:02.567
This way it is.

418
00:39:09.607 --> 00:39:11.043
[Queenie] What is this place?

419
00:39:11.811 --> 00:39:13.611
[Karl] No idea, Queenie.

420
00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:15.715
[Queenie] Some kind of abyss?

421
00:39:16.182 --> 00:39:18.250
[Reggie] Yeah. Where are we?

422
00:39:19.617 --> 00:39:22.088
This is fucking hell
[inaudible].

423
00:39:22.121 --> 00:39:23.255
[Queenie] Let's get out of this.

424
00:39:23.289 --> 00:39:27.793
[Karl] Guys, can we stop?
I can't take it any longer.

425
00:39:27.827 --> 00:39:29.594
[Queenie] I'm exhausted too.

426
00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:35.768
[Nolan] Hold on.

427
00:39:36.235 --> 00:39:39.238
[ominous music playing]

428
00:39:44.944 --> 00:39:46.846
Yeah, okay, we can stay in here.

429
00:39:47.847 --> 00:39:49.648
Karl, shut the door behind you.
Reggie.

430
00:39:49.682 --> 00:39:51.851
- [Reggie] Uh-huh?
- [Nolan] Can we get these candles lit up?

431
00:39:52.351 --> 00:39:53.686
[Reggie] All right, boss.

432
00:39:53.719 --> 00:39:55.221
[lighter clinks]

433
00:39:57.890 --> 00:39:58.824
[thuds]

434
00:40:00.226 --> 00:40:01.794
- Fuck you, dude.
- Sorry.

435
00:40:16.642 --> 00:40:18.010
[lighter clicks]

436
00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:22.815
So that's the floor plan
of this place.

437
00:40:23.382 --> 00:40:26.052
Yeah,
looks like an old military fort.

438
00:40:26.085 --> 00:40:28.287
We need to find the control room
and switch on the generator.

439
00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:30.622
I'll take every single one
of you out to dinner

440
00:40:30.656 --> 00:40:33.159
if you can find one thing
that works in this pit.

441
00:40:33.192 --> 00:40:36.796
Well, you better book us a table
because Queenie's never wrong.

442
00:40:36.829 --> 00:40:39.165
Well,
I would if I had my phone then.

443
00:40:41.167 --> 00:40:44.303
Josie would have gotten us
out of here for sure.

444
00:40:46.906 --> 00:40:48.941
- [Queenie] Poor Joe.
- Yeah.

445
00:40:50.376 --> 00:40:53.611
Um, you know he knew my dad?

446
00:40:55.881 --> 00:40:57.016
Yeah.

447
00:40:59.251 --> 00:41:00.719
They played
in the Stormy Clouds together.

448
00:41:04.857 --> 00:41:06.225
Your dad played basketball?

449
00:41:06.258 --> 00:41:07.860
Yeah, small forward.

450
00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:11.230
It's the same hat as Joe's.

451
00:41:13.165 --> 00:41:14.934
Never seen your dad before.

452
00:41:16.035 --> 00:41:17.636
When did you last see him?

453
00:41:19.805 --> 00:41:21.107
[Reggie] Two years ago.

454
00:41:23.742 --> 00:41:24.844
It must be tough.

455
00:41:26.445 --> 00:41:27.913
They set him up.

456
00:41:29.448 --> 00:41:33.352
They were a patsy. He did nothing
but he's the one doing time.

457
00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:41.060
- Well, that was your dad's?
- Yeah.

458
00:41:41.994 --> 00:41:43.095
It's cool.

459
00:41:44.363 --> 00:41:47.900
- So, where are we?
- Yeah.

460
00:41:48.901 --> 00:41:52.138
We should be right here.

461
00:41:53.038 --> 00:41:54.940
This place is huge.

462
00:41:54.974 --> 00:41:58.144
According to the floor plan,
the control room is right there.

463
00:41:58.177 --> 00:41:59.678
And I think
we should go check it out.

464
00:41:59.712 --> 00:42:01.413
- [Karl] Yeah.
- Yeah, I'll go.

465
00:42:02.448 --> 00:42:03.782
You're up.

466
00:42:04.817 --> 00:42:06.018
I'm going to stay here.

467
00:42:06.051 --> 00:42:07.920
I think I might stay here, too.

468
00:42:07.953 --> 00:42:11.991
Okay, look, Reggie, you stay here
with them and I'll go with Nolan.

469
00:42:14.059 --> 00:42:14.927
Good luck.

470
00:42:15.794 --> 00:42:17.796
Don't you two
have too much fun, yeah?

471
00:42:21.333 --> 00:42:25.104
[laughing]

472
00:42:41.387 --> 00:42:43.822
[footsteps approaching]

473
00:42:43.856 --> 00:42:46.859
[ominous music playing]

474
00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:56.902
All right, so the control room
shouldn't be too far now.

475
00:42:56.936 --> 00:42:58.037
- [mouse squeals]
- [screams]

476
00:42:58.070 --> 00:43:00.372
- What?
- Nothing.

477
00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:02.942
It was just a mouse.

478
00:43:02.975 --> 00:43:04.009
You're saying?

479
00:43:05.144 --> 00:43:08.414
I was saying that the
control room should be close.

480
00:43:08.447 --> 00:43:09.481
Okay.

481
00:43:23.329 --> 00:43:26.332
[eerie music playing]

482
00:43:30.236 --> 00:43:32.304
I said the control room
should be near.

483
00:43:33.572 --> 00:43:36.775
So straight ahead, then right.

484
00:43:37.543 --> 00:43:38.911
Isn't it left?

485
00:43:43.115 --> 00:43:46.885
Yeah, sorry, I've got
terrible sense of direction.

486
00:43:47.519 --> 00:43:49.388
Well, at least,
you're really good at drawing.

487
00:43:49.421 --> 00:43:50.923
- You think?
- Yeah.

488
00:43:52.157 --> 00:43:54.827
I saw your sketches on the bus,
I thought they were amazing.

489
00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:55.861
Thanks.

490
00:43:57.963 --> 00:43:59.531
You know, my mom painted.

491
00:43:59.565 --> 00:44:02.901
Really? Cool.
Like what sort of things?

492
00:44:02.935 --> 00:44:05.004
Just all sorts of landscapes.

493
00:44:05.838 --> 00:44:10.376
My favorite one is above my bed, it's this
amazing beach with like the bluest sea

494
00:44:10.409 --> 00:44:12.311
and its really white sand.

495
00:44:13.445 --> 00:44:14.246
So, it's beautiful.

496
00:44:15.981 --> 00:44:19.551
Five, six, five, six,
seven, eight...

502
00:44:35.601 --> 00:44:38.871
You know,
I'd kill for a hamburger right now.

503
00:44:38.904 --> 00:44:39.838
I bet you would.

Just shut up, yeah?

511
00:45:04.063 --> 00:45:05.931
And that counts
for the noises, too.

513
00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:10.402
You're busting my fucking balls,
bro. Shut up.

515
00:45:11.170 --> 00:45:13.138

- Warming up.

517
00:45:14.907 --> 00:45:16.875
You're busting my fucking balls.

00:45:16.909 --> 00:45:19.044
- Guys.
- Shut up.

519
00:45:19.078 --> 00:45:20.312
So, you do have them?

520
00:45:21.213 --> 00:45:22.514
- Fuck you.
- Guys.

521
00:45:22.548 --> 00:45:24.116
- It was a joke.
- Why do I fuck [inaudible]?

522
00:45:24.149 --> 00:45:25.050
Fuck you.

523
00:45:25.951 --> 00:45:26.618
Guys.

524
00:45:28.454 --> 00:45:30.222
- Guys!
- What?

525
00:45:30.255 --> 00:45:33.892
- [sighs]
- I really need to pee.

526
00:45:36.261 --> 00:45:40.466
So, uh, who's coming with me?

527
00:45:41.166 --> 00:45:45.170

00:46:14.233 --> 00:46:15.167
What is this?

533
00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:32.685
There's lights.

534
00:46:33.919 --> 00:46:37.556
You remember on the bus,
that thing can't stand the light.

Someone's already tried

It doesn't look like
the plan worked out though.

537
00:46:49.736 --> 00:46:51.270
We need to find
the main switchboard.

538
00:46:58.444 --> 00:47:00.579
- Here is good.
- Sure.

539
00:47:08.253 --> 00:47:09.588
Turn around.

Come on, you're not the first girl
I've seen with the pants down.

You are such an idiot.

Turn around.

543
00:47:20.165 --> 00:47:22.702
I said turn around.

544
00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:30.643
Move away further.

Just hurry up and piss, yeah?
Let's get back to Karl.

You know, you are kind of cute
when you're mad though.

549
00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:56.001
Should piss you off more.

the Nocturne Wanderer.
