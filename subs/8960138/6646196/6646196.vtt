00:04:21.988 --> 00:04:23.856
<i>Every journey has its road.</i>

3
00:04:27.226 --> 00:04:30.630
<i>And every road, sooner or later,
comes to a crossing,</i>

4
00:04:32.164 --> 00:04:35.735
<i>certain junction
and only one choice to make.</i>

5
00:04:38.104 --> 00:04:40.472
<i>That crossing arrived for us,
too.</i>

6
00:04:43.643 --> 00:04:48.047
<i>But no one could have imagined that
it would change our fates forever.</i>

7
00:05:33.525 --> 00:05:37.495
<i>Lunar eclipses have
fascinated mankind throughout the ages.</i>

8
00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:41.566
<i>The relationship between man and
Moon has always been so strong</i>

9
00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:47.539
<i>that in certain ancient cultures these phenomena
were perceived as cause for great concern.</i>

10
00:05:47.572 --> 00:05:51.543
- Are you guys watching?
- I've already seen one on YouTube.

11
00:05:51.944 --> 00:05:53.079
I think I watched with my dad.

12
00:05:53.112 --> 00:05:56.215
I've got a pair of welder
glasses at home like you.

13
00:05:57.083 --> 00:05:58.583
I could lend them to you.

14
00:05:58.616 --> 00:05:59.852
No.

15
00:05:59.885 --> 00:06:03.723
Welded glasses are for solar
eclipses, not lunar eclipses.

16
00:06:03.756 --> 00:06:05.825
And they're not that great
anyway

17
00:06:05.858 --> 00:06:07.994
because of the double
refraction.

18
00:06:08.794 --> 00:06:09.962
The double what?

19
00:06:09.996 --> 00:06:11.964
- The double refraction.
- Yeah?

20
00:06:11.998 --> 00:06:15.101
Otherwise known
as the birefringence,

21
00:06:15.835 --> 00:06:19.638
an optical phenomenon
caused by the light and...

22
00:06:20.239 --> 00:06:21.640
Idiot.

23
00:06:57.943 --> 00:07:00.980
<i>Lunar eclipses were,
in fact, interpreted to be symbolic</i>

24
00:07:01.013 --> 00:07:05.751
<i>of the great afternoon sky
right over there.</i>

25
00:07:05.785 --> 00:07:06.719
Bleh!

26
00:07:06.752 --> 00:07:08.687
<i>Stories and legends aside,</i>

27
00:07:08.721 --> 00:07:10.823
<i>this eclipse will be one
of the longest</i>

28
00:07:10.856 --> 00:07:14.260
<i>and the most fascinating total
lunar eclipses of the last century.</i>

29
00:07:14.293 --> 00:07:18.998
<i>So, tonight, we encourage you
all to lift your heads to the sky</i>

30
00:07:19.031 --> 00:07:21.700
<i>and take in this spectacular
and unique event.</i>

31
00:07:22.668 --> 00:07:23.736
<i>Don't miss out.</i>

32
00:07:23.769 --> 00:07:26.839
<i>Or you'll be waiting 20 years
for the next one.</i>

33
00:07:26.872 --> 00:07:29.275
Hey, Bess, will you watch it?

34
00:07:29.942 --> 00:07:31.811
Um, I'm not sure.

35
00:07:31.844 --> 00:07:34.080
Maybe with a certain someone.

36
00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:40.019
<i>Stories and legends aside,</i>

37
00:07:40.052 --> 00:07:42.620

43
00:07:58.337 --> 00:08:01.073
Hey, Joe,
could you go any slower?

44
00:08:01.107 --> 00:08:03.042
I'm sick
of being on this piece of junk.

45
00:08:03.075 --> 00:08:06.045
This piece of junk
is four times your age, Reg.

46
00:08:06.078 --> 00:08:09.682
Oh, well, even better,
an old piece of junk.

47
00:08:09.715 --> 00:08:12.218
Guys, guys, guys, guys.

48
00:08:13.018 --> 00:08:14.286
I've got a riddle.

49
00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.688
Brace yourselves.

50
00:08:15.721 --> 00:08:20.025
What follows us
all day long behind...

51
00:08:20.059 --> 00:08:24.163
- Our shadow.
- ...in the dark?

52
00:08:27.133 --> 00:08:33.139
Oh, intelligent
screwed you over again.

53
00:08:36.942 --> 00:08:40.346
Hey, I got a riddle
you won't find online.

54
00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.715
Let's hear it.

55
00:08:43.315 --> 00:08:45.317
Seven letters has my name.

56
00:08:46.051 --> 00:08:48.354
Being a tough guy is my game.

57
00:08:49.288 --> 00:08:55.928
Neither monsters, storms, nor dragons
can stop me even without my weaponry.

58
00:08:57.096 --> 00:08:59.331
Now, ponder my words carefully.

59
00:09:00.166 --> 00:09:04.236
Virtue and nobility
are nothing without fear.

60
00:09:05.137 --> 00:09:10.042
Even for the king of kings,
him with the golden mane,

61
00:09:10.476 --> 00:09:16.248
he who thanks to me can live,
roar, and reign.

62
00:09:17.816 --> 00:09:18.784
Who am I?

63
00:09:22.254 --> 00:09:24.723
Oh, you struggling, IQ.

64
00:10:17.076 --> 00:10:19.778
Do we...
do we have to turn back now?

65
00:10:23.415 --> 00:10:25.784
Not necessarily.

66
00:12:28.173 --> 00:12:29.541
Everybody stay here.

67
00:12:43.255 --> 00:12:45.190
Oh, gross.

68
00:12:45.224 --> 00:12:47.192
Poor thing.
It must have been run over.

69
00:12:47.226 --> 00:12:48.127
What the fuck is it?

70
00:12:48.661 --> 00:12:49.895
Oh.

71
00:12:51.397 --> 00:12:52.364
Should we help him?

72
00:12:52.398 --> 00:12:53.265
Nah.

73
00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.201
I bet it stinks.

74
00:12:56.669 --> 00:12:58.370
Yeah, like you after
P.E.

75
00:13:02.508 --> 00:13:04.276
You are such a pig.

76
00:13:04.309 --> 00:13:06.278
Oink, oink.

77
00:13:32.371 --> 00:13:34.306
You know, I rode a pig once.

78
00:13:34.339 --> 00:13:37.342
Just pigs riding pigs, yeah?

79
00:13:38.177 --> 00:13:41.413
Anyway,
I'm on this pig, massive.

80
00:13:41.447 --> 00:13:44.149
So, I was grabbing it by his
ears and we started riding

81
00:13:44.183 --> 00:13:46.084
and all I hear the whole time...

82
00:13:48.053 --> 00:13:50.522
So, I'm riding it and there's a
herd of them behind me also...

83
00:13:51.658 --> 00:13:53.192
- ...and then Chris...
- A... a whole herd of them?

84
00:13:53.225 --> 00:13:54.694
A whole herd of them.
And Chris' chick...

85
00:13:54.727 --> 00:13:59.298
Well, well, well, good evening.

86
00:14:02.769 --> 00:14:04.136
Sit down.

87
00:14:05.304 --> 00:14:08.407
Just stay calm, guys, okay?
He's not going to hurt us.

88
00:14:09.074 --> 00:14:10.375
Wrong answer.

89
00:14:11.043 --> 00:14:15.347
From now on,
you just sit down and you drive.

90
00:14:16.615 --> 00:14:18.718
I should be doing the talking
from now on.

91
00:14:19.384 --> 00:14:20.252
Got that kids?

92
00:14:23.455 --> 00:14:25.257
I can't hear you. You got it?

93
00:14:26.124 --> 00:14:27.326
- Got it.
- Got it.

94
00:14:27.694 --> 00:14:28.560
Good.

95
00:14:34.533 --> 00:14:35.635
Obedient, too.

96
00:14:39.104 --> 00:14:42.274
You, there.

97
00:14:44.142 --> 00:14:45.244
You...

98
00:14:47.346 --> 00:14:48.480
drive.

99
00:14:56.321 --> 00:14:57.322
It's him.

100
00:15:04.664 --> 00:15:05.765
That was him.

101
00:15:05.798 --> 00:15:11.270
Mark, he was trying to kiss her
and she was screaming.

102
00:15:11.303 --> 00:15:17.209
So, I go,
"Hey, leave her alone."

103
00:15:18.343 --> 00:15:20.546
And then he turns around
with a stupid little face

104
00:15:20.579 --> 00:15:24.784
and goes, "Karl,
the canteen's over that way."

105
00:15:25.685 --> 00:15:27.553
And he was with his friends,
there was like seven of them.

106
00:15:27.586 --> 00:15:29.521
Yeah,
but I bet that didn't scare you.

107
00:15:30.188 --> 00:15:31.256
Of course, it didn't.

108
00:15:32.391 --> 00:15:34.661
I slide tag with him and
kick them straight in the balls,

109
00:15:34.694 --> 00:15:37.496
then I got up and hit the other
one with a backhand strike.

110
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:42.601
Yeah. The third managed to block
me, but I kicked down the fourth

111
00:15:42.635 --> 00:15:44.202
and pushed the third
on to the sixth.

112
00:15:44.236 --> 00:15:50.142
And the last one, well,
attacked him with a super boost

113
00:15:50.576 --> 00:15:56.181
just like a real wrestler,
letting chaos everywhere, KO,

114
00:15:56.548 --> 00:15:57.583
and the final kiss.

115
00:15:58.283 --> 00:16:01.286
- A super boost?
- Mm-hmm. Just like that.

116
00:16:03.422 --> 00:16:04.423
Sorry.

117
00:16:12.364 --> 00:16:15.100
- Is that him?
- Yes.

118
00:16:16.636 --> 00:16:19.404
We've been looking for this guy
everywhere.

119
00:16:20.305 --> 00:16:26.746
We really have to find him before he
claims other victims and eats more tongues.

120
00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:29.414
And I don't know what it is,

121
00:16:29.882 --> 00:16:32.685
but he just seems
to love teenagers.

122
00:16:34.486 --> 00:16:36.388
We've got that super boost,
right?

123
00:16:53.773 --> 00:16:57.744
Now, if you could all
listen carefully,

124
00:16:58.678 --> 00:17:01.246
throw your fucking phones
out the windows.

125
00:17:07.285 --> 00:17:08.453
You, too.

126
00:17:08.988 --> 00:17:12.591
- Fuck you.
- Reg, do what he says.

127
00:17:12.624 --> 00:17:13.492
Sit.

128
00:17:17.262 --> 00:17:18.798
He's right, you know.

129
00:17:20.265 --> 00:17:22.401
No time for playing games.

130
00:17:22.434 --> 00:17:23.736
This gun is real.

131
00:17:24.469 --> 00:17:27.339
And I know what death
tastes like.

132
00:17:27.372 --> 00:17:31.243
It tastes delicious.

133
00:17:33.345 --> 00:17:35.682
It's Pedro Minghella.

134
00:17:36.615 --> 00:17:38.685
The tongue eater.

135
00:17:38.718 --> 00:17:39.584
Who?

136
00:17:40.252 --> 00:17:41.821
The tongue eater.

137
00:17:42.487 --> 00:17:44.456
It's really,
I'm just fucked up, eh.

138
00:17:44.489 --> 00:17:47.526
Prison can be a very informative
experience.

139
00:17:47.559 --> 00:17:49.996
You should try it sometimes.

140
00:17:52.597 --> 00:17:53.565
Fuck.

141
00:17:55.367 --> 00:17:56.234
Good boy.

142
00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:04.476
Fucking things
turned you all into zombies.

143
00:18:08.513 --> 00:18:13.753
Now, let's sit back
and enjoy the journey, shall we?

144
00:18:14.654 --> 00:18:18.390
The night is long
and the seas are rough.

145
00:19:11.409 --> 00:19:12.678
What's your name boy?

146
00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:16.414
- Uh, Nolan. Nolan.
- Nolan?

147
00:19:17.349 --> 00:19:18.383
Nolan Parker.

148
00:19:20.953 --> 00:19:22.454
Nolan Parker.

149
00:19:23.122 --> 00:19:25.357
Sounds like something
out of a comic book.

150
00:19:26.793 --> 00:19:28.961
I used to love comic books
when I was a kid.

151
00:19:30.029 --> 00:19:34.667
First thing I ever stole,
pack of smokes, comic book.

152
00:19:35.902 --> 00:19:37.302
I was obsessed.

153
00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:35.661
Shit.

154
00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:39.364
What's going on?

155
00:20:40.633 --> 00:20:41.968
You better not
be fucking with me.

156
00:20:42.001 --> 00:20:43.870
I don't know, it just stopped.

157
00:20:43.903 --> 00:20:45.738
Well, get it fixed.

158
00:20:46.138 --> 00:20:47.974
You don't want me to lose
my patience, do you?

159
00:20:52.812 --> 00:20:54.914
It won't start.
It... it must be the motor.

160
00:20:56.082 --> 00:20:59.185
- Get here.
- No, no, please, please, don't hurt me.

161
00:20:59.218 --> 00:21:00.518
Now, you get it fixed.

162
00:21:00.552 --> 00:21:03.555
One mistake,
and her head goes boom.

163
00:21:03.588 --> 00:21:08.794
- Okay, okay, just calm down.
- Calm down?

164
00:21:08.828 --> 00:21:10.830
I'm always calm.

165
00:21:10.863 --> 00:21:11.764
Get out.

166
00:21:12.832 --> 00:21:13.766
Okay.

167
00:21:22.074 --> 00:21:23.843
And that goes for you lot, too.

168
00:21:45.831 --> 00:21:46.699
He's going to kill us.

169
00:21:47.565 --> 00:21:48.634
He's going to kill us all.

170
00:21:49.201 --> 00:21:50.568
He's an absolute psycho.

171
00:21:51.203 --> 00:21:52.939
We need to disarm him.

172
00:21:52.972 --> 00:21:55.174
Yeah, I agree. But how?

173
00:21:55.207 --> 00:21:58.144
No, no, no, don't...
don't try and be a hero now.

174
00:21:58.811 --> 00:22:00.913
He'll shoot you in the head
without thinking twice.

175
00:22:00.947 --> 00:22:05.651
Yeah, Fat is right. For now,
we just need to do nothing, all right?

176
00:22:05.685 --> 00:22:07.086
Wait for the right moment.

177
00:22:08.254 --> 00:22:10.022
God.

178
00:22:13.759 --> 00:22:14.627
Well?

179
00:22:15.828 --> 00:22:21.968
I don't know,
it must be the engine.

180
00:23:08.714 --> 00:23:09.982
Get that thing out of here.

181
00:23:10.615 --> 00:23:11.784
I'll stay here with them.

182
00:25:03.929 --> 00:25:04.997
Oh, no, fuck!

183
00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:07.366
- Shut up! Shut up and sit down.
- No, we need to go.

184
00:25:07.399 --> 00:25:09.068
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

185
00:25:09.101 --> 00:25:10.436
- Sit down!
- Oh, my God!

186
00:25:10.469 --> 00:25:13.172
Shut up and shut up and shut up!
Let me fucking think.

187
00:25:13.205 --> 00:25:15.174
Oh, my God, you fucking psycho.

188
00:25:15.207 --> 00:25:17.009
Look at his mess.
Just let us off.

189
00:25:17.042 --> 00:25:17.977
That's enough.

190
00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:20.146
I don't want to hear
another one out of you.

191
00:25:20.179 --> 00:25:21.647
Do you understand?

192
00:25:26.018 --> 00:25:27.052
Fuck.

193
00:25:27.419 --> 00:25:29.255
Where the fuck are the keys?

194
00:25:29.889 --> 00:25:31.457
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

195
00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:33.125
Fuck! Fuck!

196
00:25:33.726 --> 00:25:36.128
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

197
00:25:36.162 --> 00:25:37.062
Fuck!

198
00:25:46.739 --> 00:25:47.439
It's showtime.

199
00:25:48.507 --> 00:25:49.942
Go get the keys
off that bastard.

200
00:25:51.043 --> 00:25:53.647
- Now!
- Leave him alone, I'll go.

201
00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:55.915
Okay, move it.

202
00:25:56.382 --> 00:25:57.783
Bess, no!

203
00:26:02.922 --> 00:26:07.126
She makes one wrong move
and I'll blow your brains out.

204
00:27:47.393 --> 00:27:48.994
Get it started.

205
00:27:50.262 --> 00:27:51.964
I'm not starting shit.

206
00:27:51.997 --> 00:27:53.866
I don't even know
how to fucking drive.

207
00:27:55.167 --> 00:27:56.335
So, you're okay?

208
00:27:58.404 --> 00:28:00.172
And Joseph?

209
00:28:11.383 --> 00:28:12.885
Just do it.

210
00:28:15.888 --> 00:28:18.324
It was awful.

211
00:28:18.891 --> 00:28:25.297
It was like he'd been bitten by
maybe an animal, like, I don't know.

212
00:28:26.098 --> 00:28:27.032
I don't know.

213
00:28:32.304 --> 00:28:33.172
Fuck.

214
00:28:34.139 --> 00:28:35.374
So?

215
00:28:37.677 --> 00:28:39.378
Make this thing move.

216
00:28:40.145 --> 00:28:42.514
Are you blind? I'm trying.

217
00:28:42.548 --> 00:28:46.018
And I'm trying to resist the
urge to shoot you in the face.

218
00:28:46.051 --> 00:28:48.587
Oh, God.

219
00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:50.155
We need to do something.

220
00:28:55.227 --> 00:29:01.567
Well, if you do not get this pile of
junk moving in the next 10 seconds,

221
00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:04.570
I'm going to shoot every one
of your friends one at a time

222
00:29:04.603 --> 00:29:06.639
starting with four-eyes.

223
00:29:08.574 --> 00:29:10.175
Her name's IQ.

224
00:29:10.542 --> 00:29:14.413
This piece of junk
belonged to my friend Joe.

225
00:29:14.446 --> 00:29:16.315
No, no, no!

226
00:29:20.018 --> 00:29:21.920
So, who's really fucking
crazy now, eh?

227
00:29:22.554 --> 00:29:24.957
You haven't got the balls.

228
00:29:28.327 --> 00:29:29.461
I know that smell.

229
00:29:30.963 --> 00:29:34.933
It's the smell of a gutless little
wonder trying to play the big man.

230
00:29:36.335 --> 00:29:41.407
If I were you, I'd shoot now before
your friends all smell it too.

231
00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:42.608
I don't have any friends.

232
00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:46.545
It's here.

233
00:29:49.381 --> 00:29:53.252
I didn't escape from prison to
die in a battle box like this.

234
00:30:10.436 --> 00:30:13.038
Come on, show your face.

235
00:30:24.717 --> 00:30:27.654
<i>♪ La, la, la, la ♪</i>

236
00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:02.421
Shh. Shh.

237
00:31:07.593 --> 00:31:09.161
Oh, shit.

238
00:31:09.194 --> 00:31:12.030
- Shit. Shit. Shit.
- We are... we are doomed.

239
00:31:12.064 --> 00:31:14.132
- Come, Bess, come.
- Fuck this! Fuck this! Fuck this!

240
00:31:14.166 --> 00:31:15.501
This is not happening.
This is not happening.

241
00:31:15.534 --> 00:31:19.639
- Calm... down.
- No, he fired. He could be dead as well.

242
00:31:19.672 --> 00:31:22.441
Yeah, we're all gonna be dead
next, you know. Shut the fuck up.

243
00:31:22.474 --> 00:31:25.143
- Calm down!
- We're trapped in a tunnel

244
00:31:25.611 --> 00:31:29.348
- and we're all going to die one by one.
- Fuck.

245
00:31:29.381 --> 00:31:31.684
No, no, no, come on, there must be
a logical explanation for all this.

246
00:31:31.718 --> 00:31:35.220
The only logical thing here is
certainly this little whiny bitch.

247
00:31:35.254 --> 00:31:36.355
Reggie, stop,
this isn't helping.

248
00:31:36.388 --> 00:31:39.091
Oh, all right, what the fuck
are you going to do, huh?

249
00:31:39.124 --> 00:31:40.592
You're gonna fucking hit me
or something?

250
00:31:40.626 --> 00:31:42.160
Let's just calm down, Reggie.

251
00:31:42.194 --> 00:31:45.364
Just stop it. You're not making
things any easier.

252
00:32:23.703 --> 00:32:28.607
Fuck.

253
00:32:28.641 --> 00:32:33.545
Okay, oh, you got me.
I'm... I'm scared shitless.

254
00:32:34.413 --> 00:32:37.215
They... they... they...
they... they... they weren't...

255
00:32:37.249 --> 00:32:38.617
Those weren't hands.

256
00:32:39.318 --> 00:32:40.653
They weren't human.

257
00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:42.521
They definitely weren't.

258
00:32:42.554 --> 00:32:44.489
We need to get out of here now.

259
00:32:45.157 --> 00:32:47.660
Oh, please Lord, please.

260
00:32:47.694 --> 00:32:50.262
Okay, Reggie, you drive.
Now, you're just making too much noise.

261
00:32:50.295 --> 00:32:55.233
Boys, that's it, we need to create
a fucking pandemonium, idiot.

262
00:32:56.836 --> 00:32:59.204
Fucking damn it!

263
00:33:01.908 --> 00:33:04.242
A push won't fucking work.

264
00:33:04.276 --> 00:33:07.914
- Nothing is fucking working.
- We just need to deal with this ourselves, okay?

265
00:33:07.947 --> 00:33:10.917
Yeah, if we all work as a team,
we'll probably make it out of here alive.

266
00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:12.652
Fuck this.

267
00:33:12.685 --> 00:33:15.587
Fuck this. I don't need this.

268
00:33:16.421 --> 00:33:20.392
I just want to get off
this fucking bus and go home.

269
00:33:20.425 --> 00:33:22.561
That is what we all want,
Reggie.

270
00:35:13.572 --> 00:35:15.373
Reggie, come on. Reggie.

271
00:35:15.407 --> 00:35:16.608
You hear me? Reggie.

272
00:35:16.642 --> 00:35:17.977
You okay?

273
00:35:25.051 --> 00:35:26.819
I won't make a sound.

274
00:36:46.498 --> 00:36:47.733
Let go of me!

275
00:37:23.703 --> 00:37:25.470
Oh, God!

276
00:37:25.503 --> 00:37:26.839
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

277
00:37:50.562 --> 00:37:54.166
Come on, come on, hurry up.
Hurry up.

278
00:37:55.868 --> 00:37:58.838
Come on, let's go.
Go, go, go!

279
00:37:59.639 --> 00:38:01.841
- Hurry up, quickly!
- Come on, come, come on.

280
00:38:23.561 --> 00:38:25.463
Hey, where are you going, Karl?

281
00:38:25.497 --> 00:38:26.699
What, would you rather
turn back?

282
00:38:26.732 --> 00:38:27.800
Absolutely not.

283
00:38:27.833 --> 00:38:29.802
Okay, look, we just need
to keep going, okay.

284
00:38:29.835 --> 00:38:30.870
Yeah.
We'll find somewhere safe.

285
00:38:30.903 --> 00:38:32.772
We've got a better chance
of getting out of here.

286
00:38:32.805 --> 00:38:33.739
Yeah.

287
00:38:44.516 --> 00:38:48.553
- Yup, this place is fucking terrifying.
- Okay, just calm down.

288
00:38:48.586 --> 00:38:49.889
It's my worst nightmare.

289
00:38:53.225 --> 00:38:54.559
Fuck that.

290
00:38:56.996 --> 00:38:58.130
Fuck that.

291
00:39:01.267 --> 00:39:02.567
This way it is.

292
00:39:09.607 --> 00:39:11.043
What is this place?

293
00:39:11.811 --> 00:39:13.611
No idea, Queenie.

294
00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:15.715
Some kind of abyss?

295
00:39:16.182 --> 00:39:18.250
Yeah. Where are we?

296
00:39:19.617 --> 00:39:22.088
This is fucking hell.

297
00:39:22.121 --> 00:39:23.255
Let's get out of this.

298
00:39:23.289 --> 00:39:27.793
Guys, can we stop?
I can't take it any longer.

299
00:39:27.827 --> 00:39:29.594
I'm exhausted too.

300
00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:35.768
Hold on.

301
00:39:44.944 --> 00:39:46.846
Yeah, okay, we can stay in here.

302
00:39:47.847 --> 00:39:49.648
Karl, shut the door behind you.
Reggie.

303
00:39:49.682 --> 00:39:51.851
- Uh-huh?
- Can we get these candles lit up?

304
00:39:52.351 --> 00:39:53.686
All right, boss.

305
00:40:00.226 --> 00:40:01.794
- Fuck you, dude.
- Sorry.

306
00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:22.815
So that's the floor plan
of this place.

307
00:40:23.382 --> 00:40:26.052
Yeah,
looks like an old military fort.

308
00:40:26.085 --> 00:40:28.287
We need to find the control room
and switch on the generator.

309
00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:30.622
I'll take every single one
of you out to dinner

310
00:40:30.656 --> 00:40:33.159
if you can find one thing
that works in this pit.

311
00:40:33.192 --> 00:40:36.796
Well, you better book us a table
because Queenie's never wrong.

312
00:40:36.829 --> 00:40:39.165
Well,
I would if I had my phone then.

313
00:40:41.167 --> 00:40:44.303
Josie would have gotten us
out of here for sure.

314
00:40:46.906 --> 00:40:48.941
- Poor Joe.
- Yeah.

315
00:40:50.376 --> 00:40:53.611
Um, you know he knew my dad?

316
00:40:55.881 --> 00:40:57.016
Yeah.

317
00:40:59.251 --> 00:41:00.719
They played
in the Stormy Clouds together.

318
00:41:04.857 --> 00:41:06.225
Your dad played basketball?

319
00:41:06.258 --> 00:41:07.860
Yeah, small forward.

320
00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:11.230
It's the same hat as Joe's.

321
00:41:13.165 --> 00:41:14.934
Never seen your dad before.

322
00:41:16.035 --> 00:41:17.636
When did you last see him?

323
00:41:19.805 --> 00:41:21.107
Two years ago.

324
00:41:23.742 --> 00:41:24.844
It must be tough.

325
00:41:26.445 --> 00:41:27.913
They set him up.

326
00:41:29.448 --> 00:41:33.352
They were a patsy. He did nothing
but he's the one doing time.

327
00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:41.060
- Well, that was your dad's?
- Yeah.

328
00:41:41.994 --> 00:41:43.095
It's cool.

329
00:41:44.363 --> 00:41:47.900
- So, where are we?
- Yeah.

330
00:41:48.901 --> 00:41:52.138
We should be right here.

331
00:41:53.038 --> 00:41:54.940
This place is huge.

332
00:41:54.974 --> 00:41:58.144
According to the floor plan,
the control room is right there.

333
00:41:58.177 --> 00:41:59.678
And I think
we should go check it out.

334
00:41:59.712 --> 00:42:01.413
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'll go.

335
00:42:02.448 --> 00:42:03.782
You're up.

336
00:42:04.817 --> 00:42:06.018
I'm going to stay here.

337
00:42:06.051 --> 00:42:07.920
I think I might stay here, too.

338
00:42:07.953 --> 00:42:11.991
Okay, look, Reggie, you stay here
with them and I'll go with Nolan.

339
00:42:14.059 --> 00:42:14.927
Good luck.

340
00:42:15.794 --> 00:42:17.796
Don't you two
have too much fun, yeah?

341
00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:56.902
All right, so the control room
shouldn't be too far now.

342
00:42:58.070 --> 00:43:00.372
- What?
- Nothing.

343
00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:02.942
It was just a mouse.

344
00:43:02.975 --> 00:43:04.009
You're saying?

345
00:43:05.144 --> 00:43:08.414
I was saying that the
control room should be close.

346
00:43:08.447 --> 00:43:09.481
Okay.

347
00:43:30.236 --> 00:43:32.304
I said the control room
should be near.

348
00:43:33.572 --> 00:43:36.775
So straight ahead, then right.

349
00:43:37.543 --> 00:43:38.911
Isn't it left?

350
00:43:43.115 --> 00:43:46.885
Yeah, sorry, I've got
terrible sense of direction.

351
00:43:47.519 --> 00:43:49.388
Well, at least,
you're really good at drawing.

352
00:43:49.421 --> 00:43:50.923
- You think?
- Yeah.

353
00:43:52.157 --> 00:43:54.827
I saw your sketches on the bus,
I thought they were amazing.

354
00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:55.861
Thanks.

355
00:43:57.963 --> 00:43:59.531
You know, my mom painted.

356
00:43:59.565 --> 00:44:02.901
Really? Cool.
Like what sort of things?

357
00:44:02.935 --> 00:44:05.004
Just all sorts of landscapes.

358
00:44:05.838 --> 00:44:10.376
My favorite one is above my bed, it's this
amazing beach with like the bluest sea

359
00:44:10.409 --> 00:44:12.311
and its really white sand.

360
00:44:13.445 --> 00:44:14.246
So, it's beautiful.

361
00:44:15.981 --> 00:44:19.551
Five, six, five, six,
seven, eight...

362
00:44:28.894 --> 00:44:30.596
I'm so fucking hungry.

363
00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:32.298
Me, too.

364
00:44:35.601 --> 00:44:38.871
You know,
I'd kill for a hamburger right now.

365
00:44:38.904 --> 00:44:39.838
I bet you would.

366
00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:45.044
With some fried eggs,
jalapenos...

367
00:44:47.246 --> 00:44:53.452
...double bacon,
fries and a large drink.

368
00:44:54.754 --> 00:44:58.190
Look, man, we get that you're obese.
Just shut up, yeah?

369
00:45:04.063 --> 00:45:05.931
And that counts
for the noises, too.

370
00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:10.402
You're busting my fucking balls,
bro. Shut up.

371
00:45:11.170 --> 00:45:13.138
- Guys.
- Warming up.

372
00:45:14.907 --> 00:45:16.875
You're busting my fucking balls.

373
00:45:16.909 --> 00:45:19.044
- Guys.
- Shut up.

374
00:45:19.078 --> 00:45:20.312
So, you do have them?

375
00:45:21.213 --> 00:45:22.514
- Fuck you.
- Guys.

376
00:45:22.548 --> 00:45:24.116
- It was a joke.
- Why do I fuck?

377
00:45:24.149 --> 00:45:25.050
Fuck you.

378
00:45:25.951 --> 00:45:26.618
Guys.

379
00:45:28.454 --> 00:45:30.222
- Guys!
- What?

380
00:45:30.255 --> 00:45:33.892
I really need to pee.

381
00:45:36.261 --> 00:45:40.466
So, uh, who's coming with me?

382
00:46:14.233 --> 00:46:15.167
What is this?

383
00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:32.685
There's lights.

384
00:46:33.919 --> 00:46:37.556
You remember on the bus,
that thing can't stand the light.

385
00:46:40.092 --> 00:46:41.694
Someone's already tried
to kill it.

386
00:46:42.461 --> 00:46:44.997
It doesn't look like
the plan worked out though.

387
00:46:49.736 --> 00:46:51.270
We need to find
the main switchboard.

388
00:46:58.444 --> 00:47:00.579
- Here is good.
- Sure.

389
00:47:08.253 --> 00:47:09.588
Turn around.

390
00:47:09.621 --> 00:47:11.658
Come on, you're not the first girl
I've seen with the pants down.

391
00:47:13.058 --> 00:47:14.761
You are such an idiot.

392
00:47:14.794 --> 00:47:16.261
Turn around.

393
00:47:20.165 --> 00:47:22.702
I said turn around.

394
00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:30.643
Move away further.

395
00:47:34.714 --> 00:47:38.050
- Not too far though.
- All right, all right.

396
00:47:39.284 --> 00:47:42.588
Just hurry up and piss, yeah?
Let's get back to Karl.

397
00:47:49.528 --> 00:47:53.599
You know, you are kind of cute
when you're mad though.

398
00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:56.001
Should piss you off more.

399
00:47:57.770 --> 00:48:02.574
Queenie, are you done?

400
00:48:05.344 --> 00:48:06.245
Queenie.

401
00:48:08.848 --> 00:48:10.215
Shit.

402
00:48:10.249 --> 00:48:12.351
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

403
00:48:12.384 --> 00:48:13.585
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

404
00:48:33.706 --> 00:48:36.341
Karl, they've got her.

405
00:48:47.619 --> 00:48:49.354
It should be in here somewhere.

406
00:49:09.642 --> 00:49:11.109
Here it is.

407
00:49:11.143 --> 00:49:12.511
Queenie!

408
00:49:12.879 --> 00:49:15.748
- It's all my fucking fault.
- Check in her.

409
00:49:15.782 --> 00:49:16.883
- IQ!
- IQ!

410
00:49:16.916 --> 00:49:18.751
Queenie!

411
00:49:19.886 --> 00:49:23.388
- Oh, shit, shit. IQ!
- Queenie!

412
00:49:24.389 --> 00:49:25.591
Queenie!

413
00:49:25.624 --> 00:49:26.558
Queenie!

414
00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:30.395
Queenie? Oh!

415
00:49:30.429 --> 00:49:33.498
Queenie!

416
00:49:34.166 --> 00:49:35.400
Get the fuck off of her!

417
00:49:35.434 --> 00:49:37.502
Get the fuck off of her!

418
00:49:37.536 --> 00:49:39.171
Oh, my God! Run!

419
00:49:42.809 --> 00:49:44.677
Run! Run!

420
00:49:56.521 --> 00:49:58.290
It won't budge.

421
00:49:58.323 --> 00:49:59.324
Let me help you.

422
00:50:04.864 --> 00:50:08.367
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm... I'm fine.

423
00:50:10.970 --> 00:50:11.904
Reggie.

424
00:50:27.452 --> 00:50:28.320
Reggie.

425
00:50:32.859 --> 00:50:34.192
Reg!

426
00:50:45.872 --> 00:50:46.739
Reggie.

427
00:50:56.415 --> 00:50:57.315
Reg!

428
00:50:58.718 --> 00:51:01.954
No! No! No!

429
00:51:01.988 --> 00:51:03.690
No! No!

430
00:51:03.723 --> 00:51:06.693
No! No! No! No!

431
00:51:06.726 --> 00:51:07.927
No!

432
00:51:12.765 --> 00:51:13.733
Reg!

433
00:51:34.386 --> 00:51:35.688
They found the generator.

434
00:51:35.722 --> 00:51:37.255
We need to find them.

435
00:53:26.498 --> 00:53:29.434
"Your end, my beginning."

436
00:53:29.467 --> 00:53:31.570
"9th of February 2000."

437
00:53:45.017 --> 00:53:47.552
So, all we need to do now is
find the entrance to this place.

438
00:54:15.047 --> 00:54:17.884
Oh, my God.

439
00:54:21.888 --> 00:54:24.422
Reggie went with Queenie
who needed to wee.

440
00:54:24.456 --> 00:54:26.158
I stayed back but then Reggie
came back without Queenie

441
00:54:26.192 --> 00:54:27.760
- and said she'd been taken by a bunch of...
- Whoa, whoa, slow down,

442
00:54:27.793 --> 00:54:29.095
Karl, slow down. Calm down.

443
00:54:32.064 --> 00:54:33.598
I left her alone.

444
00:54:34.734 --> 00:54:35.668
It's my fault.

445
00:54:36.636 --> 00:54:38.570
I'll be all right.

446
00:54:46.679 --> 00:54:47.579
Shit.

447
00:54:48.915 --> 00:54:51.416
Look, guys,
we need to fucking go.

448
00:54:52.218 --> 00:54:53.119
We can't.

449
00:54:56.889 --> 00:54:58.124
We need to show you
something first.

450
00:55:01.961 --> 00:55:05.631
Ladies and gentlemen,
let me introduce you to Giulio Sarpi.

451
00:55:08.968 --> 00:55:11.971
So, we're not the only people
who've seen this thing.

452
00:55:14.106 --> 00:55:15.641
He was obsessed with it.

453
00:55:15.675 --> 00:55:17.777
He called it
the Nocturne Wanderer.

454
00:55:18.644 --> 00:55:21.647
It killed his sister
40 years ago in this very place.

455
00:55:21.681 --> 00:55:26.786
Listen, "Isabelle and I
loved going on adventures.

456
00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:31.489
We used to pretend we were
explorers discovering faraway lands.

457
00:55:33.025 --> 00:55:36.629
And this evening was the perfect
evening for an expedition.

458
00:55:37.997 --> 00:55:41.499
We knew the place by heart
and our parents trusted us..."

459
00:55:42.201 --> 00:55:45.137
<i>Isabelle and I loved
going on adventures.</i>

460
00:55:45.171 --> 00:55:48.207
<i>We used to pretend we were
explorers discovering faraway lands</i>

461
00:55:48.841 --> 00:55:51.644
<i>and this evening was the perfect
evening for an expedition.</i>

462
00:55:52.111 --> 00:55:55.748
<i>We knew that place by heart
and our parents trusted us.</i>

463
00:55:55.781 --> 00:55:59.752
<i>After all, nobody believes
in the big, bad wolf</i>

464
00:55:59.785 --> 00:56:01.687
<i>until it crosses their path.</i>

465
00:56:02.054 --> 00:56:04.556
<i>It appeared
before our eyes out of nowhere.</i>

466
00:56:04.589 --> 00:56:06.258
<i>It drew you into his lair</i>

467
00:56:06.292 --> 00:56:09.594
<i>and my life has never been
the same again.</i>

468
00:57:09.855 --> 00:57:14.126
<i>And God said let there be light,
and there was light.</i>

469
00:57:14.693 --> 00:57:18.596
<i>God looking on the light,
saw that it was good</i>

470
00:57:18.631 --> 00:57:21.667
<i>and he made a division
between the light and the dark.</i>

471
00:57:22.134 --> 00:57:26.906
<i>And it was in the darkness that I
looked for you without ever finding you.</i>

472
00:57:27.306 --> 00:57:31.143
<i>You're the only nightmare
that has haunted me for years,</i>

473
00:57:31.177 --> 00:57:34.313
<i>as elusive and real
as the darkness.</i>

474
00:57:34.914 --> 00:57:37.883
<i>But I swear I will find you.</i>

475
00:57:44.790 --> 00:57:46.659
<i>I know how to trap you.</i>

476
00:57:46.692 --> 00:57:49.962
<i>And this time,
you won't run away.</i>

477
00:57:50.729 --> 00:57:53.132
<i>Your end, my beginning.</i>

478
00:59:32.798 --> 00:59:33.933
Shit.

479
00:59:35.067 --> 00:59:36.135
So, he went crazy.

480
00:59:36.168 --> 00:59:37.703
He was a desperate man.

481
00:59:37.736 --> 00:59:41.740
Yeah, he dedicated his entire life to
finding out the truth about his sister.

482
00:59:42.208 --> 00:59:45.177
I mean he researched everything
from theories,

483
00:59:45.211 --> 00:59:47.279
to scientific evidence,
to even pictures.

484
00:59:47.313 --> 00:59:48.814
Our theories are right.

485
00:59:49.315 --> 00:59:51.850
It hates the light
and lives in the darkness.

486
00:59:51.884 --> 00:59:58.023
Yeah, it feeds off of blood and
liquids like a vampire or a leech.

487
00:59:58.057 --> 01:00:01.894
No. Like a parasite.

488
01:00:03.095 --> 01:00:04.096
Like a parasite.

489
01:00:05.064 --> 01:00:06.232
And now it's fed on IQ.

490
01:00:06.265 --> 01:00:08.367
It won't stop
until it's finished.

491
01:01:42.127 --> 01:01:45.130
So, what's the plan?

492
01:01:45.597 --> 01:01:48.200
So, we have to stay.

493
01:01:50.135 --> 01:01:51.170
Stay and kill it.

494
01:01:52.171 --> 01:01:54.073
Finish the job
Giulio Sarpi started.

495
01:01:55.274 --> 01:01:57.910
I don't want anyone
to get hurt because of me.

496
01:01:57.943 --> 01:01:59.878
No one is getting left behind.

497
01:01:59.912 --> 01:02:01.847
We can only do this
if are all together.

498
01:02:02.514 --> 01:02:05.084
Just like a team of superheroes.

499
01:02:06.285 --> 01:02:09.288
What would you say, Reg?
I like being a superhero.

500
01:02:15.127 --> 01:02:18.530
If I see one spandex suit,
I'm fucking out.

501
01:02:21.533 --> 01:02:22.935
Let's kill this.

502
01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:25.337
His end.

503
01:02:26.138 --> 01:02:27.072
Our beginning.

504
01:02:57.069 --> 01:02:59.405
Ready.

505
01:03:38.076 --> 01:03:38.977
Karl.

506
01:03:40.012 --> 01:03:41.046
Karl.

507
01:03:41.547 --> 01:03:44.116
What?

508
01:03:44.149 --> 01:03:45.184
Stop hitting.

509
01:03:46.351 --> 01:03:47.286
Stop what?

510
01:03:47.319 --> 01:03:48.287
Your hands.

511
01:04:00.633 --> 01:04:04.036
Come on, fucking wanderer.

512
01:05:14.573 --> 01:05:16.074
Come on! Fuck.

513
01:06:38.891 --> 01:06:42.695
Hey, come in here! Come on!

514
01:06:53.271 --> 01:06:55.607
Reggie, come on. Come on.

515
01:07:15.527 --> 01:07:17.362
I'm scared.

516
01:07:17.396 --> 01:07:20.733
So am I, IQ,
but we'll make it out of here.

517
01:07:20.767 --> 01:07:25.203
Please don't... please don't leave me alone.

518
01:07:25.237 --> 01:07:26.806
I won't. I promise.

519
01:08:37.476 --> 01:08:39.712
Go, go. Go now!

520
01:08:40.545 --> 01:08:44.650
Come on, come on,
come on, we've got to go.

521
01:09:42.742 --> 01:09:45.845
- Run! Come on! Hurry up! Quickly!
- Come on! You can do it!

522
01:09:45.878 --> 01:09:46.979
Come on!

523
01:09:52.885 --> 01:09:55.922
Fight me now,
you fucking piece of shit.

524
01:11:10.830 --> 01:11:11.731
For Joe.

525
01:11:14.033 --> 01:11:15.001
For Joe.

526
01:11:23.943 --> 01:11:26.478
<i>Seven letters compose my name.</i>

527
01:11:26.511 --> 01:11:28.915
<i>Being a tough guy is my game.</i>

528
01:11:28.948 --> 01:11:33.451
<i>Neither monsters,
storms, no dragons can stop me.</i>

529
01:11:33.485 --> 01:11:36.088
<i>Even if you strip me
off my weaponry.</i>

530
01:11:37.123 --> 01:11:39.125
<i>Now, ponder my words carefully.</i>

531
01:11:39.959 --> 01:11:44.096
<i>Virtue and nobility
are nothing without fear.</i>

532
01:11:44.697 --> 01:11:46.799
<i>Even for the king of kings...</i>

533
01:11:46.832 --> 01:11:48.500
<i>...Him with the golden mane.</i>

534
01:11:48.533 --> 01:11:50.069
<i>He, who thanks to me...</i>

535
01:11:50.102 --> 01:11:51.237
<i>...can live...</i>

536
01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:52.772
- <i>...roar...</i>
- <i>...and reign.</i>

537
01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:55.440
<i>Courage.</i>

538
01:11:56.574 --> 01:11:58.244
<i>That was the answer
to the riddle</i>

539
01:11:58.277 --> 01:12:02.480
<i>and the only word to describe
what that ordeal taught us.</i>

540
01:12:03.581 --> 01:12:07.619
<i>What started as a simple shortcut
turned out to be much more.</i>

541
01:12:08.654 --> 01:12:11.623
<i>No one believed our story
or took us seriously.</i>

542
01:12:17.263 --> 01:12:18.731
<i>But it doesn't matter.</i>

543
01:12:19.966 --> 01:12:23.836
<i>What counts is us,
our friendship,</i>

544
01:12:24.203 --> 01:12:28.641
<i>and that incredible truth
that will stay with each of us</i>

545
01:12:28.674 --> 01:12:30.710
<i>for the rest of our lives.</i>

546
