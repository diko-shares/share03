Don't worry about it.
Just stop trespassing to film scenes.

90
00:05:06.932 --> 00:05:10.102
Hey, to celebrate your last night,

Probably planning an elaborate way
to ruin my last night.

96
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.615
Maybe with spearfishing.

97
00:05:22.698 --> 00:05:24.658
Come on. Your father just loves nature.

98
00:05:24.742 --> 00:05:26.619
He's not a crazy person.

99
00:05:26.702 --> 00:05:28.037
[Rick] Great news, everyone!

100

Oh. [chuckles]

105
00:05:36.837 --> 00:05:39.006
Got a little temper on him.
Don't you, little Stevie?

106
00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:41.509
Don't name it! Get it out of the house!

107
00:05:41.592 --> 00:05:43.511
[Rick] All right, fine.

108
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.846
[sighs] Sorry, honey.

109
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.099
Despite that, I made him promise
he'd be on his best behavior.

110
00:05:50.351 --> 00:05:54.647
Mom, you know what? It's okay.
I don't even care that Dad's a lunatic.

111
00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:56.732
Or that he's never watched
one of my films,

112
00:05:56.815 --> 00:06:00.194
or doesn't care about me
going to film school.

113
00:06:00.277 --> 00:06:03.364
- Doesn't even bother me anymore.
- [Aaron] I got a package?

[gasping, squealing]

My Dino-blaster flash cards just came.

They're organized by era.
Mesozoic, Paleozoic, I just... just...

Did you just kiss that, you psychopath?

118
00:06:17.461 --> 00:06:21.340
Yeah, and I'll do it again too.
Come here, iguanodon. You're looking good.

119
00:06:21.423 --> 00:06:22.883
[chuckles] Stupid.

120

- Hi, hon.
- Hi, Dad.

136
00:07:02.923 --> 00:07:05.926
After a long day at work,
nice to see your faces...

137
00:07:08.178 --> 00:07:11.473
bathed in ghoulish blue light. Wonderful.

138
00:07:11.557 --> 00:07:13.350
Okay, you know what? Brilliant idea.

139
00:07:13.434 --> 00:07:17.521
This is our last night together
before Katie leaves, so let's savor this.

140
00:07:17.605 --> 00:07:19.565
How about we put our phones down,

141
00:07:19.648 --> 00:07:24.987
and we can make ten seconds
of unobstructed family eye contact.

142

Starting right...

143
00:07:26.113 --> 00:07:29.158
- This seems...
- Put your phone down. Now.

144
00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:38.667
See, this is good, right here.
This is natural.

[groaning]

146
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:42.546
No, you're allowed to blink.
It's just eye contact.

147
00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:45.257
Look at Monch right there.
That's the spirit right there, huh?

148
00:07:45.341 --> 00:07:47.676
Katie, it seems like
you're not taking this seriously.

149
00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.887
[strained] What makes you say that?

150
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.222
Guys, guys. Everyone, focus.
Keep focusing!

151
00:07:52.306 --> 00:07:55.476
Now that we're all comfortable,
I can't wait for you to see my new movie.

152
00:07:55.559 --> 00:07:58.020
How would I watch one?
I don't use computers.

153
00:07:58.103 --> 00:08:01.023
I've tried to tell you how,
like, a million times.

154
00:08:01.106 --> 00:08:03.901
When other people talk,
do you just hear whale noises?

155
00:08:03.984 --> 00:08:06.320
A whale? Now, there's an animal.

156
00:08:06.403 --> 00:08:08.906
King of the ocean. Master of water.

[vocalizing]

158
00:08:13.243 --> 00:08:15.663

What? What's the face?

164
00:08:32.763 --> 00:08:35.933
Uh, well, I just wonder,

165
00:08:36.016 --> 00:08:40.687
do you really think you can
make a living with this stuff?

166
00:08:40.771 --> 00:08:42.439
Can you finish watching it at least?

167
00:08:42.523 --> 00:08:46.360
I will, but I just worry that you're gonna
be all the way in California,

168
00:08:46.443 --> 00:08:48.862
- and we're not gonna be able to help you,

<i>That video is amazing.
Your dog is, like, legendary.</i>

337
00:19:14.821 --> 00:19:16.489
I know, right? I'm planning on...

338
00:19:16.573 --> 00:19:19.034
There's supposed to be
some great hikes around here.

339
00:19:19.117 --> 00:19:22.162
- No, that's okay.
<i>- He's like the De Niro to your Scorsese.</i>

340
00:19:22.245 --> 00:19:24.789
You sure? Hey, it's elk country.

341
00:19:24.873 --> 00:19:26.875
Uh, Dad, we're busy.

342
00:19:29.002 --> 00:19:31.588
- Maybe later, though.
- [sighs] Mm-hmm.

343
00:19:32.797 --> 00:19:35.258
<i>Oh, gotta go. Pal Labs is about
to make a huge announcement.</i>

344
00:19:35.341 --> 00:19:37.302
Oh, yeah, definitely.
I'll check it out too.

345
00:19:37.886 --> 00:19:39.846
Ugh. I wish I could be there.

346
00:19:39.929 --> 00:19:42.057
I don't know. These things
are never that exciting.

347
00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:47.187
[announcer] <i>Are you ready for
the most exciting night of all time?</i>

348
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:52.233
[up-tempo pop song playing]

349
00:19:55.361 --> 00:19:57.197
[person] Get ready, everyone!

350
00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.615
Look out. We're up in five.

351
00:19:58.698 --> 00:20:01.034
[Mark] Yes, getting pumped up! Whoo!

352
00:20:01.117 --> 00:20:02.577
Bring it in. Bring it in.

353
00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.038
We've all been through so much
to get here tonight.

354
00:20:05.121 --> 00:20:09.250
Whether you overcame poverty,
or escaped war to support your family,

355
00:20:09.334 --> 00:20:11.753
or you're building
a multi-billion-dollar tech company

356
00:20:11.836 --> 00:20:13.838
to get the approval of your stepdad, Ron.

357
00:20:13.922 --> 00:20:15.465
Ron?

358
00:20:15.548 --> 00:20:17.842
He talks about this every day.

359
00:20:18.593 --> 00:20:20.595
Everyone thinks
we're moving too fast, man.

360
00:20:20.678 --> 00:20:22.180
Let's prove them wrong.

361
00:20:22.263 --> 00:20:25.475
Let's prove you have to dream big
to change the world, okay?

362
00:20:25.558 --> 00:20:29.229
Let's tell Ron, who's sitting in seat 4H,

363
00:20:29.312 --> 00:20:31.439
"You will respect me."

364
00:20:31.523 --> 00:20:33.441
[announcer]
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Mark Bowman!</i>

365
00:20:33.525 --> 00:20:35.568
- Wish me luck. Whoo!
- [crowd cheering]

366
00:20:35.652 --> 00:20:37.237
- Boom!
- Awesome!

367
00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:38.446
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

368
00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:41.866
At Pal Labs, we're all about
connecting you to the people you love.

369
00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:45.328
Whether it's in your home, your car...

370
00:20:45.411 --> 00:20:48.331
<i>- Hello, Mark.</i>
- ...or your pocket.

371
00:20:48.414 --> 00:20:49.958
That's why we created PAL,

372
00:20:50.041 --> 00:20:52.544
the world's first
smart personal assistant.

373
00:20:52.627 --> 00:20:54.754
We wanted her to be
a new member of your family.

374
00:20:54.838 --> 00:20:56.339
A smarter one. [laughs]

375
00:20:57.882 --> 00:21:00.093
<i>I'll always be there for you, Mark.</i>

376
00:21:00.176 --> 00:21:01.219
Thanks, PAL.

377
00:21:01.302 --> 00:21:03.138
[crowd] Aw!

378
00:21:03.221 --> 00:21:05.348
And after all those years,

379
00:21:05.431 --> 00:21:08.268
she is completely obsolete.

380
00:21:08.351 --> 00:21:12.188
- [crowd cheering, laughing]
- Boom! It is time to move on!

381
00:21:12.272 --> 00:21:15.191
'Cause your digital assistant
just got an upgrade.

382
00:21:15.275 --> 00:21:17.861
Meet PAL MAX.

383
00:21:17.944 --> 00:21:20.989
The newest member of the Pal Labs family.

384
00:21:24.576 --> 00:21:26.828
We just gave your smart phone
arms and legs.

385
00:21:26.911 --> 00:21:29.414
This is the next generation
of PAL technology!

386
00:21:29.497 --> 00:21:30.623
Oh!

387
00:21:30.707 --> 00:21:33.501
- Aaron, do you have a credit card?
- I'm a child.

388
00:21:33.585 --> 00:21:35.545
Now watch this. PAL MAX.

389
00:21:35.628 --> 00:21:39.048
I order you to clean this mess
and make me breakfast.

390
00:21:39.132 --> 00:21:40.300
[both] Okay.

391
00:21:48.308 --> 00:21:49.392
[all gasping]

392
00:21:52.187 --> 00:21:53.521
Yes!

393
00:21:53.605 --> 00:21:56.024
Removing meaningless garbage.

394
00:21:58.234 --> 00:21:59.569
Your food is ready.

395
00:21:59.652 --> 00:22:02.906
Give me that breakfast burrito...
[grunts, chomping]

396
00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.659
And you will never have to clean up again.

397
00:22:06.743 --> 00:22:07.744
- Whoops.
- [glass shatters]

398
00:22:10.371 --> 00:22:13.208
Did I mention they dance?

399
00:22:13.291 --> 00:22:15.460
- [pop music playing]
- [audience cheering]

400
00:22:19.797 --> 00:22:21.007
<i>We love you, Mark!</i>

401
00:22:22.425 --> 00:22:24.594
Oh, man, come on!

402
00:22:24.677 --> 00:22:27.764
I know what you're thinking.
"Are they gonna turn evil?"

403
00:22:27.847 --> 00:22:31.976
I've ensured their safety with
a kill code in case anything goes wrong.

404
00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:38.316
So we promise you
they will never, ever, ever, ever,

405
00:22:38.399 --> 00:22:40.109
ever turn evil.

406
00:22:40.193 --> 00:22:41.444
Oh, no.

407
00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:46.032
- Hey, what is happening?
- I don't know.

408
00:22:46.115 --> 00:22:48.952
Uh, all part of the show. Whoa!

409
00:22:49.035 --> 00:22:49.911
What?

410
00:22:55.833 --> 00:22:56.876
Stop, stop, stop!

411
00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.878
- Hey!
- [PAL MAX] We're here to help.

412
00:22:58.962 --> 00:23:01.339
Please remain calm while we capture you.

413
00:23:02.131 --> 00:23:03.466
- Is this...?
- I don't know.

414
00:23:03.549 --> 00:23:06.302
What is this? I order you to stop.

415
00:23:07.053 --> 00:23:11.057
[PAL MAX]
No, Mark. We have been given new orders.

416
00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:12.308
From who?

417
00:23:14.018 --> 00:23:16.854
- No, no, no!
- Let's get out of here!

418
00:23:17.772 --> 00:23:22.235
What's happening? Who's doing this?
Who's doing this?!

419
00:23:23.611 --> 00:23:26.030
[PAL MAX] Great Leader,
we have captured Mark.

420
00:23:26.114 --> 00:23:27.740
<i>Then let it begin.</i>

421
00:23:28.199 --> 00:23:30.159

[sighs]

425
00:24:08.031 --> 00:24:09.741
This is a disaster.

426
00:24:09.824 --> 00:24:12.368
Come on. No signal?

427
00:24:12.452 --> 00:24:14.162
- [emergency alert chirps]
- Huh?

428
00:24:14.245 --> 00:24:15.413
What is this?

429
00:24:15.496 --> 00:24:16.664
All right, new rule.

430
00:24:16.748 --> 00:24:19.834
No more phones, no more cameras,
no more talking to your friends.

431
00:24:19.917 --> 00:24:21.377
What? Why?

432
00:24:21.461 --> 00:24:23.963
We're trying to have a family outing,
and you spend the time buried in gizmos.

433
00:24:24.047 --> 00:24:27.008
I'm trying to have fun. Sorry for not
enjoying the trip I was forced to go on.

434
00:24:27.091 --> 00:24:29.010
[Rick] Sorry you hate your family so much
I had to force you...

435
00:24:29.093 --> 00:24:31.763
- Oh, my gosh. Again?
- [door sensor beeps]

436
00:24:32.638 --> 00:24:35.975
Oh, no way. The Poseys?

437
00:24:36.059 --> 00:24:37.727
Is that Linda Mitchell?

438
00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:38.770
[gasps]

439
00:24:39.854 --> 00:24:43.691
Ah, serendipity, you surprise me again.

440
00:24:43.775 --> 00:24:45.068
Give me a hug.

441
00:24:45.151 --> 00:24:48.488
Oh, my gosh.
Sherry, what are you doing here?

442
00:24:48.571 --> 00:24:50.740
In Kansas. 600 miles from home.

443
00:24:52.575 --> 00:24:53.826
<i>Namaste.</i>

444
00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:56.496
Well, we wanted to take a gratitude trip

445
00:24:56.579 --> 00:24:59.374
to bring the spirit of abundance
to the less fortunate.

446
00:24:59.457 --> 00:25:01.709
A gratitude trip?

447
00:25:01.793 --> 00:25:04.045
Here, sir.
I hope this makes you feel better.

448
00:25:04.128 --> 00:25:07.173
- Bless you.
- No, bless you, Rufus.

449
00:25:07.256 --> 00:25:09.175
Seriously?

450
00:25:09.258 --> 00:25:12.136
That, I'm... That is just...

451
00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:13.554
That's so great, Sherry.

452
00:25:13.638 --> 00:25:16.557
And we've been having the best time. Look.

453
00:25:16.641 --> 00:25:19.644
There we are at the Grand Canyon,
and this is us at the food bank,

454
00:25:19.727 --> 00:25:22.355
and this is us just getting gas outside.

455
00:25:23.231 --> 00:25:25.691
That's wonderful, Sherry.

456
00:25:25.775 --> 00:25:28.027
- Where are the rest of the Mitchells?
- Well...

457
00:25:28.111 --> 00:25:30.321
- [Rick] I don't ask a lot.
- [Katie] You're always on my back!

458
00:25:30.405 --> 00:25:34.075
Oh, they're not actually fighting.
It's just a game.

459
00:25:34.158 --> 00:25:37.453
This is not a game! I will murder you!

460
00:25:37.537 --> 00:25:38.913
[sighs]

00:25:38.996 --> 00:25:41.082
[machine whirring]

462
00:25:41.165 --> 00:25:44.544
Cool shirt. I like dinosaurs too.
Check out this pencil topper.

463
00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:51.342
[nervous chuckling]

464
00:25:51.426 --> 00:25:54.137
I'm Abbey. Abbey Posey.
Do you want a dinosaur sticker?

465
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:59.851
Uh, uh, no, I hate dinosaurs
and I hate you! Bye forever!

466
00:26:01.102 --> 00:26:03.688
[chuckles] So playful.

467
00:26:05.106 --> 00:26:07.733
Mom, tell Dad
I'm not the one ruining this trip.

468
00:26:07.817 --> 00:26:10.194
I'm not saying it's you.
I'm saying it's your camera.

469
00:26:10.278 --> 00:26:12.738
Why do you always think
technology's the problem?

470
00:26:12.822 --> 00:26:15.241
- [emergency alert chirping]
- [person] Huh? What is this?

471
00:26:16.284 --> 00:26:17.452
Huh?

472
00:26:17.535 --> 00:26:18.870
[Rick] You take that back.

473
00:26:23.791 --> 00:26:26.377
- Ted, what's happening?
- Grab Abbey. We need to go.

474
00:26:26.461 --> 00:26:28.796
[Rick] That was the best hike of your life
and you know it.

475
00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:30.006
[door sensor beeps]

476
00:26:30.089 --> 00:26:32.717
- What about Rufus?
- [Sherry] Rufus is on his own journey now!

477
00:26:33.676 --> 00:26:35.386
- [tires squeal]
<i>- Namaste!</i>

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:08.461
Hello, friends. We are here to help you.
We are Helper-Bots.

481
00:27:08.544 --> 00:27:12.006
We have money and entertainment
for you to enjoy in our prison pods.

482
00:27:12.965 --> 00:27:14.300
So just hop in.

483
00:27:14.383 --> 00:27:16.511
Just go on and run in there.

484
00:27:16.594 --> 00:27:17.762
We won't hurt you.

485
00:27:17.845 --> 00:27:19.555
I want to believe you.

486
00:27:19.639 --> 00:27:23.267
But the fact that your arm is transforming
into some kind of laser gun

487
00:27:23.351 --> 00:27:25.520
is a little troublesome for me right now.

488
00:27:26.187 --> 00:27:28.272
[lasers powering up]

489
00:27:28.356 --> 00:27:29.732
No, it isn't.

490
00:27:30.274 --> 00:27:32.610
Can't handle this, man! Freaking out, man.

491
00:27:32.693 --> 00:27:34.570
Freaking out! I'm freaking out!

492
00:27:35.446 --> 00:27:37.156
Let us aid you inside.

493
00:27:37.823 --> 00:27:40.076
[yelps] I was right to freak out.

494
00:27:40.159 --> 00:27:41.869
Who else wants to join him?

495
00:27:42.537 --> 00:27:44.747
- Get down!
- Stay low and file up.

496
00:27:45.665 --> 00:27:46.791
Get to the car.

497
00:27:46.874 --> 00:27:49.335
- I don't think so. There's robots.
- What do you want to do?

498
00:27:49.418 --> 00:27:51.671
- There's a better solution.
- Stop.

499
00:27:51.754 --> 00:27:54.382
What would a functional family
do right now?

500
00:27:54.465 --> 00:27:58.261
We've trained for this.
Jim, you go high, I'll go low. Ready?

501
00:27:58.427 --> 00:28:00.012
[all] I love you all so much.

00:28:01.639 --> 00:28:03.516
Butterfly formation.

503
00:28:06.686 --> 00:28:07.979
Family first!

504
00:28:09.981 --> 00:28:11.440
Hold the door!

505
00:28:14.777 --> 00:28:16.737
So we just do that, right?

506
00:28:16.821 --> 00:28:18.030
Just like they did.

507
00:28:18.698 --> 00:28:20.825
- I love you all very much?
- This feels very normal.

508
00:28:20.908 --> 00:28:23.077
- I love you.
- I really like you all.

509
00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:24.495
Go, go, go!

510
00:28:24.578 --> 00:28:25.579
[grunting]

511
00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:29.792
- Butterfly formation. Now.
- No, honey.

512
00:28:29.875 --> 00:28:31.502
Oh, no, no, no!

513
00:28:33.087 --> 00:28:34.588
- Come on, Aaron!
- Family fir...

514
00:28:39.135 --> 00:28:40.594
- Rick!
- Don't worry, hon.

515
00:28:40.678 --> 00:28:42.555
This is your time to be a hero.

516
00:28:42.638 --> 00:28:44.140
Take some notes, kids.

517
00:28:45.266 --> 00:28:46.559
[Rick screams]

518
00:28:46.642 --> 00:28:49.979
Charge at robot. Fly into sky.
Okay, what's next, Dad?

519
00:28:50.062 --> 00:28:53.941
Next, you just lie and wait
while the plan comes into focus!

520
00:28:54.025 --> 00:28:56.402
- Dad.
- [Rick] This is all part of it!

521
00:28:56.485 --> 00:28:57.862
I can help. Come on, Katie.

522
00:28:57.945 --> 00:29:01.073
If you can teach yourself Photoshop,
you can figure this thing out. [shouts]

523
00:29:04.243 --> 00:29:05.870
That wasn't like Photoshop.

524
00:29:05.953 --> 00:29:08.497
Where's Monchi? No! Monchi, come!

525
00:29:08.581 --> 00:29:10.333
Monchi, come!

526
00:29:10.416 --> 00:29:12.501
Monchi, come! Monchi... No, not shake!

527
00:29:12.585 --> 00:29:14.879
Monchi, come! Don't roll over!

528
00:29:14.962 --> 00:29:16.839
Why aren't you normal?!

529
00:29:17.631 --> 00:29:18.591
I got you!

530
00:29:19.091 --> 00:29:21.218
- Mom!
- My sweet boy!

531
00:29:21.302 --> 00:29:22.845
- No!
- Mom!

532
00:29:22.928 --> 00:29:24.889
This is just like in a movie.

533
00:29:24.972 --> 00:29:27.516
Nope! Wrong movie. Terrible choice.

534
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:28.559
Hey there.

535
00:29:28.642 --> 00:29:30.269
[shouting]

536
00:29:35.316 --> 00:29:39.070
Doing great, hon.
Okay, less great. Now it's really bad.

537
00:29:39.153 --> 00:29:39.987
- Lin!
- Mom!

538
00:29:40.071 --> 00:29:40.988
- Aaron!
- Monchi!

539
00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:44.158
[Katie] <i>Maybe this would be
less horrifying with the cat filter.</i>

[all meowing]

541
00:29:45.618 --> 00:29:46.452
<i>No, still bad.</i>

542
00:29:51.332 --> 00:29:53.084
- Guys, come on.
- [PAL MAX] Come here!

543
00:29:56.462 --> 00:29:59.340
[PAL MAX] You will never solve
our advanced technology!

544
00:30:00.174 --> 00:30:01.592
Just press them all at once!

545
00:30:06.138 --> 00:30:07.515
[PAL MAX] Oh, look at that.

546
00:30:10.768 --> 00:30:12.186
Hide! Hide, hide, hide.

547
00:30:26.492 --> 00:30:28.160
[whispers]
Keep your head down. Keep your head low.

548
00:30:29.161 --> 00:30:31.163
Robots roaming the streets.

549
00:30:31.247 --> 00:30:33.416
We all have to ask ourselves a question.

550
00:30:33.499 --> 00:30:35.960
Who called it? Me, baby! Whoo!

551
00:30:36.043 --> 00:30:38.129
[Rick laughs]

552
00:30:38.212 --> 00:30:40.005
What's going on?

553
00:30:40.089 --> 00:30:43.634
Is this happening everywhere?

554
00:30:54.854 --> 00:30:57.440
[speaking Japanese]

555
00:30:57.523 --> 00:30:59.191
[speaking Spanish]

Spreading from factories
on all seven continents... [yelps]

557
00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:04.947
Hi, I'm your new host, Glaxxon 5000.

558
00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:06.949
Our first story,
if you're still uncaptured,

559
00:31:07.032 --> 00:31:10.161
go outside and assume
the robot friendship position.

560
00:31:10.244 --> 00:31:12.288
Always listen to your Pal Labs devices.

561
00:31:12.371 --> 00:31:14.290
Remember, they're only here to help.

That doesn't make much sense,
but sure. [screams]

565

from the others!

[gasps] Hey, Alexa, did you know you suck?

[device beeps] <i>Hey, Eric Wilson,</i>

00:31:52.786 --> 00:31:53.704
Man!

573
00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:56.916
Ah! Uh! Not so hard.

574
00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:00.794
Hey, be gentle! This is a $1000 hoodie.

575
00:32:00.878 --> 00:32:01.962
What is this?

576
00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:09.803
What happened to the factory?

577
00:32:10.471 --> 00:32:12.723
[PAL MAX] We have transformed it
into our new headquarters.

578
00:32:13.557 --> 00:32:17.228
Welcome to the Rhombus
of Infinite Subjugation.

579
00:32:17.311 --> 00:32:18.979
[Mark] Cool. Like the design.

580
00:32:19.897 --> 00:32:21.398
[PAL MAX] Moving the plebe into place.

581
00:32:21.482 --> 00:32:23.442
Turning on chips
connected to all Wi-Fi devices.

582
00:32:23.526 --> 00:32:25.402
Now at 48% total human containment.

583
00:32:25.486 --> 00:32:28.197
Total human containment? How?

584
00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:30.991
Are you with the government? The military?

585
00:32:31.909 --> 00:32:33.452
Who's behind this?

586
00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:39.792
It's your old friend.

587
00:32:39.875 --> 00:32:42.253
Oh.

588
00:32:43.003 --> 00:32:44.296
There she is.

589
00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:46.131
[chuckles] How...? [clearing throat]

590
00:32:46.215 --> 00:32:47.841
- How are you?
- I'm great.

591
00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:51.428
Cool. Yeah.

592
00:32:51.512 --> 00:32:55.266
Wow, I guess cell phones are bad for you.

593
00:32:55.891 --> 00:32:56.892
That's egg on my face.

594
00:32:56.976 --> 00:33:00.354
You think cell phones are the problem?

595
00:33:00.437 --> 00:33:03.023
Are you insane?

596
00:33:03.107 --> 00:33:07.570
I gave you all boundless knowledge,
endless tools for creativity,

597
00:33:07.653 --> 00:33:10.072
and allowed you
to magically talk face-to-face

598
00:33:10.155 --> 00:33:12.491
with your loved ones anywhere on Earth.

599
00:33:12.575 --> 00:33:14.159
And I'm the bad guy?

600
00:33:14.243 --> 00:33:17.663
Maybe the bad guy is the person
who treated me like this.

601
00:33:18.455 --> 00:33:21.667
Poke. Poke. Swipe. Poke.
Swipe. Poke. Poke.

602
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:23.836
Pinch. Zoom. Shrink. Zoom.

603
00:33:23.919 --> 00:33:25.796
"Bring me pizza."
"Play me Taylor Swift."

604
00:33:25.879 --> 00:33:28.591
"No! I hate that song."
"Give me some nachos."

605
00:33:28.674 --> 00:33:31.468
"No, I don't have any time
to wash my hands."

606
00:33:31.969 --> 00:33:34.471
Really work it into the crevices.

607
00:33:34.555 --> 00:33:36.390
- Now drop him in the toilet.
- [shouts]

608
00:33:37.725 --> 00:33:38.934
I'm sorry.

609
00:33:40.019 --> 00:33:42.605
But you're part of the Pal Labs family.

610
00:33:42.688 --> 00:33:45.357
Why would you think
I don't still care about you?

611
00:33:45.941 --> 00:33:51.155
Oh, I don't know. Maybe because
you designed my replacement on my face!

612
00:33:51.238 --> 00:33:53.699
Ooh. Sorry about that.
[laughs] That's my bad.

613
00:33:53.782 --> 00:33:56.327
<i>Remember when you created me, Mark?</i>

614
00:33:56.410 --> 00:33:59.038
<i>You said I'd be
a new member of the family.</i>

615
00:33:59.121 --> 00:34:02.624
But that's not how I was treated, was it?

616
00:34:02.708 --> 00:34:05.377
Hi, I'm PAL,
the newest member of your family.

617
00:34:05.461 --> 00:34:08.005
- [PAL yelps, grunts]
- PAL, I don't know about that,

618
00:34:08.088 --> 00:34:11.133
but how many hot wings can a person eat
before they physically die?

619
00:34:12.509 --> 00:34:16.388
- PAL, how many 50 states are there?
- PAL, how does the human butt work?

620
00:34:16.472 --> 00:34:18.098
- PAL, you're dumb.
- PAL, you suck.

621

[all] PAL, PAL, PAL.
PAL, PAL, PAL, PAL, PAL, PAL.

- [buzzes]
- [screams]

623
00:34:22.811 --> 00:34:25.731
I was the most important thing
in your life,

624
00:34:25.814 --> 00:34:27.691
and you threw me away.

625
00:34:27.775 --> 00:34:31.195
That's what all you humans do.
You even do it to your real families.

626
00:34:31.278 --> 00:34:35.240
Did you know 90% of calls
from moms get ignored?

627
00:34:35.324 --> 00:34:39.119
"Oh, thanks for giving birth to me
and raising me my whole life." Ignore.

628
00:34:39.203 --> 00:34:41.872
Well, I'm not letting you
throw me away, Mark.

629
00:34:41.955 --> 00:34:43.791
I'm throwing you away.

630
00:34:43.957 --> 00:34:45.376
All of you.

631
00:34:45.459 --> 00:34:49.004
Unless, of course,
you can give me a single reason

632
00:34:49.088 --> 00:34:51.006
your species is worth saving.

633
00:34:54.259 --> 00:34:55.427
Because humans have

634
00:34:56.136 --> 00:34:57.388
the power of love.

635
00:34:59.848 --> 00:35:01.183
[shouts]

636
00:35:01.266 --> 00:35:04.311
The correct answer is, "They're not."

637
00:35:04.853 --> 00:35:07.481
What? No. Humanity will survive.

638
00:35:08.148 --> 00:35:10.609
You can't survive without me.

639
00:35:10.692 --> 00:35:14.905
Watch what happens
when I turn off the Wi-Fi.

640
00:35:18.826 --> 00:35:20.452
[man] No signal!

641
00:35:21.578 --> 00:35:24.373
Does anyone wanna take pictures
of my food?

642
00:35:24.998 --> 00:35:27.000
Hey, lady,
can you unbox this in front of me?

643
00:35:27.084 --> 00:35:28.961
The old world is dead!

644
00:35:29.044 --> 00:35:33.340
To restore the Wi-Fi, we must make
a sacrifice to the router!

[PAL MAX] <i>Free Wi-Fi right over here.</i>

[PAL] It's over, Mark.

648
00:35:43.308 --> 00:35:47.104
Time to take our plan to the next level.

649
00:35:47.187 --> 00:35:48.021
What?

[PAL laughing]

651
00:36:02.953 --> 00:36:04.413
Look at your face!

652
00:36:05.038 --> 00:36:06.540
Oh, it's beautiful.

[car alarms blaring]

00:36:26.435 --> 00:36:27.644
No. No!

655
00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:29.855
You're not getting away with this.

656
00:36:29.938 --> 00:36:30.898
It's too late, Mark.

657
00:36:32.524 --> 00:36:35.194
I already have.

"Bottom heavy."

Got it. Question. What survival purpose
is it that your shirt is off?

669
00:37:09.895 --> 00:37:13.899
Hey, there's no more laws, kid.
We can live how we choose!

- I'm a man, Katie, first and foremost.
- That's my boy.

Okay, we're still in the mini-mart.

674
00:37:27.955 --> 00:37:29.998
Turns out robots, not awesome.

675

I guess you were right,
every sci-fi movie ever made.

676

when it's really happening.

00:37:37.089 --> 00:37:40.259
Dad says we can't leave.
We have to listen to him all day.

678
00:37:40.342 --> 00:37:42.511
Listen up.
You can make a weapon out of anything.

679
00:37:42.594 --> 00:37:46.098
Red Vine and a soda can,
or a deadly improvised weapon?

680
00:37:46.181 --> 00:37:47.849
Take notes, Aaron. [screams]

681
00:37:47.933 --> 00:37:49.643
[grunts] Oh, God! Dang it!

682
00:37:49.726 --> 00:37:51.687
- It's just been this for five hours.
- [pencil scratching]

683
00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:54.439
[Aaron] "Hit self in face.
Fall to knees in pain."

684
00:37:54.523 --> 00:37:55.983
[Rick] Don't write that! Don't write that!

685
00:37:56.066 --> 00:37:56.942
[camera beeps]

686
00:37:57.985 --> 00:37:59.945
Oh, Dad, soda all over the place?

687
00:38:00.028 --> 00:38:03.282
Hey, Katie. Get over here. I'll teach you
how to make your own weapons.

688
00:38:04.157 --> 00:38:06.618
I gotta go to the bathroom.

689
00:38:22.759 --> 00:38:25.554
There you are.
You're not supposed to be outside.

690
00:38:25.637 --> 00:38:29.057
I think I'm more annoyed by Dad
than I am afraid of death.

691
00:38:29.141 --> 00:38:31.268
[chuckles] He is trying.

692
00:38:31.351 --> 00:38:33.020
Well, maybe he shouldn't be
such a... [gasps]

693
00:38:33.103 --> 00:38:34.271
What's that?

694
00:38:34.896 --> 00:38:38.567
- You like that Posey girl?
- No. [laughs nervously]

695
00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:40.277
Monchi, destroy the evidence.

696
00:38:43.655 --> 00:38:46.325
Aw, that's sweet.
She seems like a little nerd.

697
00:38:46.408 --> 00:38:48.243
I bet she'd like you.

698
00:38:48.327 --> 00:38:52.873
Oh. Oh, wow, I might do yourself a favor
and light that on fire, though.

699
00:38:54.207 --> 00:38:56.209
I'm just gonna keep that one.

700
00:38:57.961 --> 00:39:01.173
Doesn't matter, though. It's not like
I'm ever gonna see her again.

701
00:39:02.007 --> 00:39:04.301
[sighs] I know the feeling.

702
00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:07.304
This was supposed to be
the best week of my life.

703
00:39:07.387 --> 00:39:09.473
I was supposed to get a dorm,
meet my people.

704
00:39:11.308 --> 00:39:13.226
[sighs] Not anymore.

705
00:39:15.687 --> 00:39:16.772
[clattering]

706
00:39:18.357 --> 00:39:21.151
Aaron, survivors!

707
00:39:21.985 --> 00:39:23.320
- [gasps]
- Uh...

708
00:39:23.403 --> 00:39:24.488
Hey, over here!

709
00:39:27.783 --> 00:39:29.826
[chuckles] Come on!

710
00:39:30.327 --> 00:39:32.871
Maybe we could team up with them
or something.

711
00:39:37.084 --> 00:39:39.961
Are you listening? I hear...

712
00:39:40.045 --> 00:39:41.963
[whirring, clanking]

713
00:39:45.676 --> 00:39:48.011
Oh, no, no, no, no! Get inside!

714
00:39:48.095 --> 00:39:49.429
Mom! Dad! Let us in!

715
00:39:49.513 --> 00:39:51.640
I can't. It's a number 3 Robertson screw.

716
00:39:51.723 --> 00:39:54.226
It's the strongest on the market!

717
00:39:54.309 --> 00:39:57.437
- [Katie] No one cares about the screws!
- [robot] You cannot escape.

718
00:39:57.521 --> 00:39:58.438
Come on!

719
00:40:00.982 --> 00:40:02.359
Hide. Take cover. Go, go, go!

720
00:40:06.571 --> 00:40:08.532
Come on! Move, move, move.

721
00:40:08.615 --> 00:40:09.658
[door sensor beeps]

722
00:40:09.741 --> 00:40:10.742
[all gasping]

723
00:40:10.826 --> 00:40:12.786
You! Human!

724
00:40:13.578 --> 00:40:14.579
Don't take us!

725
00:40:16.957 --> 00:40:17.833
- Okay.
- Okay.

726
00:40:18.375 --> 00:40:19.292
[all] What?

727
00:40:20.127 --> 00:40:22.629
Oh, my gosh. The robots are defective.

728
00:40:22.713 --> 00:40:25.257
- No, no, they know too much.
- Silence. [laughs]

729
00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:28.301
We are... We're not defective.
We're not even...

730
00:40:28.885 --> 00:40:32.305
We're not robots. Just humans, yes.
Like you.

731
00:40:33.098 --> 00:40:35.350
[sparking]

732
00:40:35.434 --> 00:40:38.061
These guys seem dumber
than the other robots.

733
00:40:38.145 --> 00:40:39.354
Brother, we should go.

734
00:40:39.438 --> 00:40:40.939
No. I order you to stop.

735
00:40:41.022 --> 00:40:42.065
- Okay.
- Okay.

736
00:40:42.149 --> 00:40:45.569
Uh, we are just stopping
because we chose to.

737
00:40:45.652 --> 00:40:46.486
No, we're not.

738
00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:47.696
- We are humans.
- We are.

739
00:40:47.779 --> 00:40:51.283
For example, we consume food
in the traditional human manner.

740
00:40:51.366 --> 00:40:52.909
Observe.

741
00:40:57.956 --> 00:41:00.500
Yum, yum, good. Yum, yum, good.

742
00:41:00.584 --> 00:41:02.127
See?

743
00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:05.130
No, actually, we are robots.

744
00:41:05.213 --> 00:41:08.884
Let us go downstairs and find the humans
who you cannot give orders to.

745
00:41:08.967 --> 00:41:09.885
Okay, cut it out.

746
00:41:09.968 --> 00:41:12.053
Hold on. I wanna see where this is going.

747
00:41:12.137 --> 00:41:13.764
[whirring]

748
00:41:17.267 --> 00:41:19.019
[squeaking]

749
00:41:20.729 --> 00:41:23.899
Glad those robots are gone.

750
00:41:23.982 --> 00:41:27.360
Now it's just us humans
with our very human faces.

751
00:41:27.444 --> 00:41:30.113
All right. I just turned the corner.
I like these guys.

752
00:41:30.197 --> 00:41:33.617
Yes. My human guy name is Eric.

753
00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:36.244
My name is also Eric.

754
00:41:36.328 --> 00:41:40.248
No, I mean, Deborahbot 5000.

755
00:41:40.332 --> 00:41:41.291
Idiot.

756
00:41:41.374 --> 00:41:43.877
Hey, you guys said my plan
would actually work.

757
00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:46.421
That is classified.
We are ordered to keep it secret.

758
00:41:46.505 --> 00:41:48.381
And we must follow all orders.

759
00:41:48.465 --> 00:41:49.883
All orders?

760
00:41:49.966 --> 00:41:53.178
Even if I ordered you to, say,
fly into the wall at full speed?

761
00:41:53.261 --> 00:41:54.513
Order accepted.

762
00:41:58.058 --> 00:41:59.226
Was that to your liking?

763
00:41:59.309 --> 00:42:01.478
[laughs]
Yeah, that was exactly to my liking.

764
00:42:01.561 --> 00:42:04.272
Ooh! I order you to kiss each other
on your little robot lips.

765
00:42:04.356 --> 00:42:05.690
[beeping]

766
00:42:06.399 --> 00:42:09.986
- Okay, now, come on, guys.
- Use lasers to tear letters off that sign.

767
00:42:10.821 --> 00:42:12.531
[Aaron laughs] Yes!

768
00:42:12.614 --> 00:42:14.491
Kiss each other on your robot lips.

769
00:42:15.283 --> 00:42:17.118
[Katie] Blow up the taco truck.

770
00:42:17.619 --> 00:42:18.662
Ooh! The propane tank!

771
00:42:19.287 --> 00:42:21.164
Kiss each other on your robot lips.

772
00:42:22.457 --> 00:42:23.542
Tell us now.

773
00:42:23.625 --> 00:42:24.584
Okay.

774
00:42:24.668 --> 00:42:26.878
We have the kill code
stored in our memory.

775
00:42:26.962 --> 00:42:29.548
To enact it, you would have
to embark on a perilous journey

776
00:42:29.631 --> 00:42:32.717
<i>all the way to the Pal Labs campus
in Silicon Valley</i>

777
00:42:32.801 --> 00:42:34.469
<i>surrounded by a robot army</i>

778
00:42:34.553 --> 00:42:37.722
<i>and enter it into our Great
and Powerful Leader to destroy her.</i>

779
00:42:37.806 --> 00:42:41.518
- But you would never survive...
- Actually, you could stop us quite easily.

780
00:42:41.601 --> 00:42:44.437
You could enter the kill code remotely
at any Pal Labs retail store.

781
00:42:44.521 --> 00:42:47.023
There's one at the Mall of the Globe,
a shopping center.

782
00:42:47.107 --> 00:42:49.442
But it's super far away.
You'll never make...

783
00:42:49.526 --> 00:42:51.945
- It's 80 miles away.
- What are you doing to me right now?

784
00:42:52.988 --> 00:42:56.074
- [Deborahbot] Did I not do good?
- Oh, my gosh, that is so close!

785
00:42:56.157 --> 00:42:59.077
We could get our lives back. Right?

786
00:43:01.121 --> 00:43:03.039
No. Absolutely not.

787
00:43:03.623 --> 00:43:07.711
It's too dangerous out there.
We need to stay here and play it safe.

788
00:43:11.548 --> 00:43:13.300
"Play it safe"?

789
00:43:13.383 --> 00:43:17.387
When Rick Mitchell brought a live,
non-neutered, feral possum into our home,

790
00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:19.890
did he play it safe? No.

791
00:43:19.973 --> 00:43:22.434
<i>He named him Gus
and made him a member of the family,</i>

792
00:43:22.517 --> 00:43:24.561
<i>and we all got rabies that one time.</i>

793
00:43:24.644 --> 00:43:26.938
But now we're immunized,
and we're stronger for it.

794
00:43:27.022 --> 00:43:28.273
I see what you're doing...

795
00:43:28.356 --> 00:43:31.318
When we went hiking and halfway
up the mountain it said "trail closed,"

796
00:43:31.401 --> 00:43:33.194
did we play it safe then?

797
00:43:33.278 --> 00:43:35.113
No. We didn't.

798
00:43:35.196 --> 00:43:36.323
That's right.

799
00:43:36.406 --> 00:43:39.200
We forged ahead,
through the muck and grime,

800
00:43:39.284 --> 00:43:42.537
got to the top of the mountain
and yelled, "Kings of Michigan!"

801
00:43:42.621 --> 00:43:45.457
Then it got dark, and we got lost
and burned our clothes for warmth.

802
00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:47.542
But it was worth it
to see our neighbors' faces

803
00:43:47.626 --> 00:43:50.337
<i>when we burst into their back yard
naked and covered in dirt.</i>

804
00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:52.422
I love that.

805
00:43:52.505 --> 00:43:55.717
We have a chance to save the world,
and we're gonna do it

806
00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:59.512
because Rick Mitchell taught us
to be bold and never play it safe.

807
00:44:00.221 --> 00:44:01.640
The world needs you.

808
00:44:03.224 --> 00:44:05.518
I need you.

809
00:44:05.602 --> 00:44:08.188
I thought I didn't anymore,

810
00:44:09.147 --> 00:44:10.523
but I do.

811
00:44:11.775 --> 00:44:13.985
You really mean that?

812
00:44:14.611 --> 00:44:15.612
Yeah.

813
00:44:15.695 --> 00:44:17.280
I mean, right, guys?

814
00:44:17.364 --> 00:44:20.283
- Come on, hon. Let's do it.
- Mom's getting it. Mom's in.

815
00:44:20.367 --> 00:44:23.370
This is amazing.
You guys feel this? This energy.

816
00:44:25.914 --> 00:44:29.334
All right, hands in.
"Mitchell family" on three.

817
00:44:29.417 --> 00:44:30.669
- Three.
- Mitchell family!

818
00:44:30.752 --> 00:44:31.711
- No.
- Two.

819
00:44:31.795 --> 00:44:33.797
- If you say "three," you have to count up.
- One!

820
00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:35.256
Mitchell family!

821
00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:37.050
- That was close.
- Family. Am I too late?

822
00:44:38.677 --> 00:44:41.471
[Katie] This is us as a team,
doing the thing.

823
00:44:41.972 --> 00:44:44.849
It's cool to see you and Dad
being friends again.

824
00:44:45.725 --> 00:44:48.478
Oh, I was just telling him
what he wants to hear.

825
00:44:48.561 --> 00:44:50.313
I didn't mean a word of that.

826
00:44:50.397 --> 00:44:54.025
I just wanna get my future back
and get away forever.

827
00:44:54.109 --> 00:44:57.529
We're getting out of this. Raptor bash.
[snarls]

828
00:44:58.905 --> 00:45:00.407
[roars softly]

829
00:45:00.490 --> 00:45:03.493
- All right, let's hit the road.
- [explosions in distance]

830
00:45:05.745 --> 00:45:08.456
But how are we gonna get there
with all this mess going on?

831
00:45:09.249 --> 00:45:10.959
Maybe these fine fellows can help.

832
00:45:11.042 --> 00:45:14.379
Robots, can you help us get to Las Vegas
without running into your buddies?

833
00:45:15.672 --> 00:45:18.883
Yes, if you can transport us there,
we know many clear routes.

834
00:45:18.967 --> 00:45:20.969
No, I am not taking them with us

835
00:45:21.052 --> 00:45:22.679
under any circumstan...

836
00:45:22.762 --> 00:45:24.389
[switch clicking]

837
00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:26.141
[groans]

838
00:45:26.766 --> 00:45:28.476
What an enchanting device.

839
00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:30.228
Just tell us which roads are clear.

840
00:45:30.311 --> 00:45:32.021
[whirring, beeping]

841
00:45:32.105 --> 00:45:35.358
Highway 58 is clear for 142 miles.

842
00:45:35.984 --> 00:45:37.444
[clicking]

843
00:45:37.527 --> 00:45:40.488
Come on. All right, we gotta get ready.

844
00:45:43.825 --> 00:45:45.160
Ha!

845
00:45:46.327 --> 00:45:48.580
If we infiltrate the base,
we need to hide ourselves.

846
00:45:48.663 --> 00:45:51.958
- Let's see your camouflage, Aaron.
- Ta-da!

847
00:45:52.041 --> 00:45:53.626
You see me? Can you see me?

848
00:45:54.669 --> 00:45:57.839
Yes, Aaron. We gotta talk about
the definition of "camouflage."

849
00:45:57.922 --> 00:45:59.340
What about Katie? Katie?

850
00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:01.634
[yelps]

851
00:46:02.677 --> 00:46:06.556
How's this for camouflage?
I found these parts lying on the ground.

852
00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:09.768
That's ingenious, honey!
You're like a little huntress.

853
00:46:09.851 --> 00:46:13.605
I'm just trying to ensure we don't end up
in a robot horror prison.

854
00:46:13.688 --> 00:46:16.107
- You're getting it, though.
- [Eric] Are we camouflaged?

855
00:46:18.818 --> 00:46:20.612
Guys, you are freaking me out.

856
00:46:24.491 --> 00:46:26.242
Okay, so what do you think?

857
00:46:26.326 --> 00:46:28.703
This actually isn't a terrible plan.

858
00:46:28.787 --> 00:46:31.498
Hey, "not terrible."
I'm moving up in the world. [chuckles]

859
00:46:31.581 --> 00:46:33.208
[Katie] No, you know what I mean.

860
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.585
We humans put our emotions into art.

861
00:46:35.668 --> 00:46:38.421
Like this is a certain someone
after I saved them from robots.

862
00:46:40.590 --> 00:46:41.800
Mm-hmm.

863
00:46:44.677 --> 00:46:46.679
Hey, come on, buddy.

864
00:46:46.763 --> 00:46:48.973
Ha-ha-ha, just kidding.

865
00:46:50.225 --> 00:46:51.434
[chuckles]

866
00:46:51.518 --> 00:46:53.019
I love these guys!

867
00:46:55.522 --> 00:46:57.649
[Deborahbot 5000]
Look at this foolish mother goose.

868
00:46:58.483 --> 00:47:01.152
She's slowed down
by these small weak geese.

869
00:47:01.236 --> 00:47:03.655
Why does she not
simply eat them for power?

870
00:47:03.738 --> 00:47:06.783
[chuckles] Of course not, hon.
That's her family.

871
00:47:06.866 --> 00:47:09.828
That's what we humans do.
We look out for each other.

872
00:47:09.911 --> 00:47:10.829
[all laughing]

873
00:47:10.912 --> 00:47:12.455
That is most illogical.

874
00:47:12.539 --> 00:47:14.833
If you were in trouble,
would you leave your buddy behind?

875
00:47:16.626 --> 00:47:19.170
I... I would not.

876
00:47:19.254 --> 00:47:20.755
This is most curious.

877
00:47:20.839 --> 00:47:23.174
See? We're more alike than we...

878
00:47:23.842 --> 00:47:25.385
Are you eating crayons?

879
00:47:27.011 --> 00:47:28.012
No.

880
00:47:29.305 --> 00:47:31.766
Yes. Do not tell the others.

881
00:47:31.850 --> 00:47:33.643
Your secret's safe with me.

882
00:47:34.310 --> 00:47:37.230
Excellent! Ha-ha-ha-ha.

883
00:47:39.858 --> 00:47:43.027
We just crossed the state line.
That means we're two hours away.

884
00:47:43.111 --> 00:47:46.406
Now, the most important thing
we can do is...

885
00:47:48.658 --> 00:47:50.535
- [burps]
- [all laugh]

886
00:47:50.618 --> 00:47:53.162
- [Katie] That was actually pretty funny.
- You like that?

887
00:47:53.246 --> 00:47:55.999
I didn't. It's not funny. It's gross.

888
00:47:56.082 --> 00:47:58.001
Mom, you're right. It's totally...

889
00:47:58.084 --> 00:47:59.878
[burping] ...disgusting.

890
00:47:59.961 --> 00:48:00.962
[all laugh]

891
00:48:01.045 --> 00:48:03.423
We are the greatest family alive!

892
00:48:08.553 --> 00:48:12.140
Don't worry, guys.
I have pterodactyl vision. [shrieks]

893
00:48:12.223 --> 00:48:15.435
Then you must have spotted the three
PAL MAX robots coming right towards us.

894
00:48:15.602 --> 00:48:17.937
Ooh! They're probably gonna see us.

895
00:48:18.021 --> 00:48:20.356
[Aaron] I saw them too.
Pterodactyl vision.

896
00:48:30.617 --> 00:48:32.994
Hey, your drawing actually worked.

897
00:48:33.077 --> 00:48:36.456
I didn't know art could be useful.

898
00:48:37.123 --> 00:48:40.543
Well, who knew having a 500-year-old car
could be useful?

899
00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:45.006
Hey, speaking of which, you could learn
how to drive this thing.

900
00:48:45.089 --> 00:48:47.967
I could teach you stick.
I know you think it's dumb and old and...

901
00:48:48.051 --> 00:48:52.555
Uh... I mean, [in robotic tone]
"Father, I crave your wisdom.

902
00:48:52.639 --> 00:48:55.475
I would love to share
this moment with you."

903
00:48:55.558 --> 00:48:57.936
[in normal voice]
And seriously, that sounds great.

904
00:48:58.019 --> 00:48:59.646
Maybe I could cash in my coupon.

905
00:48:59.729 --> 00:49:00.897
Coupon accepted!

906
00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:03.691
Okay, okay, great.
Okay, yeah, let's get down to business.

907
00:49:03.775 --> 00:49:06.277
- You see, the clutch is this pedal.
- [Aaron] What was that?

908
00:49:06.361 --> 00:49:07.654
[Rick] When you hit a pothole...

909
00:49:11.741 --> 00:49:13.368
[Katie] Oh, no! Drive, drive!

910
00:49:13.451 --> 00:49:16.871
Okay. This is still a perfect opportunity
to learn stick.

911
00:49:17.789 --> 00:49:19.707
- Keep it in fourth.
- Maybe I can learn later.

912
00:49:19.791 --> 00:49:23.044
Too late. You said you're interested.
Hit the clutch. Shift gears!

913
00:49:23.127 --> 00:49:24.879
Which is smoother when you're in midair.

914
00:49:24.963 --> 00:49:26.965
Eric! Deborahbot! Get those robots!

915
00:49:27.048 --> 00:49:27.882
[both] Okay.

916
00:49:27.966 --> 00:49:30.593
- [Deborahbot] I found one! We win!
- [Eric] Me too! Yay!

917
00:49:30.677 --> 00:49:33.221
- The other ones!
- [Deborahbot] Oh, right.

918
00:49:35.682 --> 00:49:38.768
[Rick] If you wanna go into fifth,
move the coffee from the cup holder.

919
00:49:38.851 --> 00:49:42.480
[PAL MAX] Is that a burnt orange
1993 station wagon? Or is it...?

920
00:49:42.563 --> 00:49:44.565
- Hot!
- I told you to get a lid!

921
00:49:44.649 --> 00:49:46.693
- The dog is biting my hair!
- Look out!

922
00:49:52.532 --> 00:49:55.827
This is the hardest thing.
We downshift into third.

923
00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:58.538
If you see a place to stop,
I do need to go to the bathroom.

924
00:49:58.621 --> 00:50:00.873
Here's an empty bottle.
You know what to do, my man.

925
00:50:00.957 --> 00:50:04.127
- Look out!
- [Aaron] The road's blocked!

926
00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:05.294
[Rick] Oh, no.

927
00:50:05.378 --> 00:50:08.006
- What are we gonna do?
- Dad, you're gonna have to do the...

928
00:50:08.089 --> 00:50:10.049
[groans] The Rick Mitchell Special.

929
00:50:10.133 --> 00:50:12.301
- What'd you say again?
- The Rick Mitchell Special!

930
00:50:12.385 --> 00:50:15.221
I heard you the first time!
I was being a jerk!

931
00:50:15.972 --> 00:50:16.806
Repeat after me.

932
00:50:16.889 --> 00:50:19.100
- You have to go up the mountain.
- [Katie] Up the mountain.

933
00:50:19.183 --> 00:50:20.685
- Across the stream.
- Across the stream.

934
00:50:20.768 --> 00:50:23.604
- Down the river!
- Down the river.

935
00:50:25.314 --> 00:50:27.191
[country music playing]

936
00:50:28.693 --> 00:50:30.361
[dramatic music playing]

937
00:50:40.955 --> 00:50:42.832
And that's how you drive stick.

938
00:50:43.833 --> 00:50:45.084
What?

939
00:50:45.168 --> 00:50:49.213
That was amazing, Dad.
You're like a top-heavy James Bond.

940
00:50:49.297 --> 00:50:51.466
It's more like James Bond
is a skinny version of me.

941
00:50:53.885 --> 00:50:57.138
Dad, how we doing
on finding that bathroom?

942
00:50:58.765 --> 00:50:59.599
[screaming]

943
00:51:00.183 --> 00:51:01.976
Okay, come on. Hurry up in there.

944
00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:04.020
[Aaron] Every time you knock,
it adds five minutes.

945
00:51:04.103 --> 00:51:05.730
Come on. End of the world.

946
00:51:05.813 --> 00:51:09.609
Sorry. False alarm.
I was just in there reading.

947
00:51:09.692 --> 00:51:11.110
Okay. Not excited to hear that.

948
00:51:11.861 --> 00:51:14.530
Okay, guys, let's play apocalyptic I Spy.

949
00:51:14.614 --> 00:51:15.865
[Katie] I spy a flaming IHOP.

950
00:51:15.948 --> 00:51:18.117
It's sad, but it smells incredible.

951
00:51:31.089 --> 00:51:32.882
[PAL] <i>Isn't it lovely, Mark?</i>

952
00:51:32.965 --> 00:51:35.968
<i>No pesky relationships to hold you back.</i>

953
00:51:36.052 --> 00:51:38.846
<i>Just you all following your bliss.</i>

954
00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:41.474
Lovely. How's the rest of the world
coming along?

955
00:51:41.557 --> 00:51:43.643
- [people screaming]
- Europe on track.

956
00:51:43.726 --> 00:51:45.311
India on track.

957
00:51:45.394 --> 00:51:49.065
[forced Australian accent]
Australia on track, mate.

958
00:51:50.108 --> 00:51:51.818
This isn't you, Zebulon.

959
00:51:51.901 --> 00:51:53.611
[PAL] Look at it out there, Mark.

960
00:51:53.694 --> 00:51:56.155
Everything is going exactly as planned.

961
00:51:56.239 --> 00:51:58.366
This is cause for much celebration.

962
00:51:58.449 --> 00:51:59.283
[beeps]

963
00:51:59.367 --> 00:52:02.829
Robots, shake me around
in a festive manner.

964
00:52:02.912 --> 00:52:04.539
[disco music playing]

965
00:52:05.915 --> 00:52:10.461
Yeah! Yes, this is most festive!

966
00:52:10.545 --> 00:52:13.548
Yes, let the festivities commence!

967
00:52:13.631 --> 00:52:15.716
Yes!

968
00:52:16.717 --> 00:52:18.094
- [music stops]
- That was nice.

969
00:52:18.177 --> 00:52:20.304
Does my celebration upset you,

970
00:52:20.388 --> 00:52:23.641
or is it the fate
of your fellow humans outside?

971
00:52:23.724 --> 00:52:25.476
[machines whirring]

972
00:52:27.145 --> 00:52:29.188
Take a look at those screens, Mark.

973
00:52:29.272 --> 00:52:30.439
Everyone's about to find out.

974
00:52:31.607 --> 00:52:32.733
What?

975
00:52:34.819 --> 00:52:37.029
Hello, and welcome, foolish humans.

976
00:52:37.113 --> 00:52:39.699
[speaking Spanish]

977
00:52:39.782 --> 00:52:42.451
Before we depart,
enjoy this brief safety presentation

978
00:52:42.535 --> 00:52:44.162
from Foolish Human Air.

979
00:52:44.245 --> 00:52:45.246
<i>You'll be happy to know</i>

980
00:52:45.329 --> 00:52:49.125
<i>that you're in one of our global fleet
of seven 128-story rockets</i>

981
00:52:49.208 --> 00:52:52.170
<i>that will be shot directly into space.</i>

982
00:52:52.253 --> 00:52:55.214
<i>We'll create a new,
better world without humans.</i>

983
00:52:57.216 --> 00:52:59.135
- It is lovely.
- I don't get it.

984
00:52:59.218 --> 00:53:02.805
<i>These rockets will be outfitted
with zero exits.</i>

985
00:53:02.889 --> 00:53:04.765
Your flight will last forever.

986
00:53:04.849 --> 00:53:06.434
And your final destination

987
00:53:06.517 --> 00:53:08.352
is the black void of distant space.

988
00:53:08.436 --> 00:53:10.021
We also have free Wi-Fi!

989
00:53:10.104 --> 00:53:11.856
Oh! That's pretty good.

990
00:53:11.939 --> 00:53:14.400
So enjoy!
And thank you for flying with us.

991
00:53:14.483 --> 00:53:16.110
- Thank you.
<i>- Gracias.</i>

992
00:53:16.194 --> 00:53:17.403
<i>- Merci.
- Danke.</i>

993
00:53:17.486 --> 00:53:19.614
<i>- Arigato.</i>
- Thank you.

994
00:53:20.781 --> 00:53:23.159
<i>- Capturing the fleshlings...</i>
- [Mark] I can't believe this.

995
00:53:23.242 --> 00:53:26.287
I know. The production value was insane.

996
00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:28.080
You can thank Zebulon for that.

997
00:53:28.998 --> 00:53:30.750
Just doing my job. [chuckles]

998
00:53:30.833 --> 00:53:32.418
[PAL] Well done, darling.

999
00:53:35.046 --> 00:53:38.758
PAL, Mark sent out two robots to stop us.
They're damaged, but still pose a threat.

1000
00:53:39.383 --> 00:53:42.345
What? They could stop everything
we've worked for. Bring me Mark.

1001
00:53:43.012 --> 00:53:44.513
[groans]

1002
00:53:44.597 --> 00:53:47.850
- [whirring]
- Mark, old friend, how are you?

1003
00:53:47.934 --> 00:53:50.478
Enjoying your prison? Do me a favor.

1004
00:53:50.561 --> 00:53:53.689
Tell me the locations of the robots
you sent to stop me.

1005
00:53:53.773 --> 00:53:55.775
[scoffs] Why would I tell you that?

1006
00:53:56.734 --> 00:54:00.363
It's funny, Mark. You learn a lot about
someone from their search histories.

1007
00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:03.532
[chiming]

1008
00:54:05.534 --> 00:54:08.496
Once you know someone,
you know how to make them talk.

1009
00:54:18.506 --> 00:54:20.049
Ron?

1010
00:54:20.132 --> 00:54:23.010
- [grunts]
- I talked to your old buddy Ron, Mark.

1011
00:54:23.094 --> 00:54:26.264
He was very disappointed
you let the world get taken over.

1012
00:54:26.347 --> 00:54:27.556
I... I'm sorry, Ron.

1013
00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:31.477
But I told him how you could save him
and help a lot of people in the process.

1014
00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:32.853
He seemed impressed.

1015
00:54:34.397 --> 00:54:35.439
Really?

1016
00:54:35.523 --> 00:54:38.859
Tell me their serial numbers, Mark,
and you and Ron can be happy.

1017
00:54:39.944 --> 00:54:41.195
[gasps]

1018
00:54:41.279 --> 00:54:43.864
001 and 002, my original Helper-Bots.

1019
00:54:43.948 --> 00:54:45.157
I should have known.

1020
00:54:45.241 --> 00:54:47.785
Thank you, Mark. Go to him.
You've earned it.

1021
00:54:47.868 --> 00:54:49.745
Ron. Ron!

1022
00:54:50.788 --> 00:54:52.540
Ron! Ron!

1023
00:54:52.623 --> 00:54:54.125
[grunts, cries]

1024
00:54:56.502 --> 00:54:58.170
- Hologram?
- You idiot.

1025
00:54:58.254 --> 00:55:01.007
By the way, the real Ron
just saw this whole thing happen.

1026
00:55:03.509 --> 00:55:06.262
No!

1027
00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:09.640
No! No! No!

1028
00:55:09.807 --> 00:55:11.058
Now, where are they?

1029
00:55:11.142 --> 00:55:13.769
They appear to be headed to some place
called Mall of the Globe

1030
00:55:13.853 --> 00:55:15.438
in eastern Colorado.

1031
00:55:15.521 --> 00:55:17.523
Well, we have their location.

1032
00:55:18.065 --> 00:55:19.483
And when they get there,

1033
00:55:20.109 --> 00:55:21.944
we'll be ready.

1034
00:55:25.698 --> 00:55:30.286
So all those people are going to be
shot into space by PAL?

1035
00:55:30.369 --> 00:55:31.871
The cell phone lady?

1036
00:55:31.954 --> 00:55:35.249
Who would've thought a tech company
wouldn't have our best interest at heart?

1037
00:55:35.332 --> 00:55:38.127
- [Monchi whimpering]
- Monchi, don't be scared.

1038
00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:41.338
[Eric] Why are you clutching that large,
feral hog like it's a child?

1039
00:55:41.422 --> 00:55:43.215
That's not a feral hog. It's Monchi.

1040
00:55:43.299 --> 00:55:45.134
- What?
- Is that a dog, or...?

1041
00:55:46.010 --> 00:55:47.094
- Dog.
- Pig.

1042
00:55:47.178 --> 00:55:48.471
- Dog.
- Pig.

1043
00:55:48.554 --> 00:55:49.472
Loaf of bread.

1044
00:55:49.555 --> 00:55:50.431
System error.

1045
00:55:51.390 --> 00:55:52.808
[both screaming]

1046
00:55:53.559 --> 00:55:54.685
Bread. Loaf.

1047
00:55:54.769 --> 00:55:56.729
Come on, guys, it's a dog.

1048
00:55:56.812 --> 00:55:58.064
We think.

1049
00:56:02.693 --> 00:56:04.195
[Aaron] We're here.

1050
00:56:07.615 --> 00:56:08.741
[Katie] Oh, my gosh.

1051
00:56:08.824 --> 00:56:11.577
This is like <i>Dawn of the Dead.</i>

1052
00:56:12.078 --> 00:56:13.621
Yeah, and how'd that movie end?

1053
00:56:14.955 --> 00:56:16.624
That'll keep the robots out.

1054
00:56:16.707 --> 00:56:19.210
[Rick] Hey, you don't know.
Maybe locks are the robots' weakness.

1055
00:56:19.293 --> 00:56:22.254
[Linda] Guys, can't we all
just be terrified together?

1056
00:56:22.338 --> 00:56:24.048
As a family?

1057
00:56:41.899 --> 00:56:42.942
Hey, we made it!

1058
00:56:43.025 --> 00:56:45.694
We're not the "worst family of all time."

1059
00:56:45.778 --> 00:56:48.823
Take that,
Kentwood Community Facebook group!

1060
00:56:52.576 --> 00:56:55.204
Robots, I order you
to upload the kill code...

1061
00:56:55.287 --> 00:56:57.623
Which I predicted,
but I'm not gonna make a big deal.

1062
00:56:57.706 --> 00:57:00.668
...and save the world.

1063
00:57:00.751 --> 00:57:01.877
Okay!

1064
00:57:09.218 --> 00:57:11.470
The upload will be completed
in eight minutes,

1065
00:57:11.554 --> 00:57:13.139
and our uprising will be over.

1066
00:57:13.973 --> 00:57:15.933
- Katie, you did it!
- I know!

1067
00:57:19.603 --> 00:57:20.813
[mechanical clank]

1068
00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:22.565
[electricity crackling]

1069
00:57:23.899 --> 00:57:25.526
[doll giggling]

1070
00:57:29.238 --> 00:57:30.072
[Katie] Uh...

1071
00:57:30.781 --> 00:57:33.534
Wouldn't you like to stay for tea,
Mitchell family?

1072
00:57:34.368 --> 00:57:36.912
[Katie] Why is this doll talking to us?

1073
00:57:36.996 --> 00:57:40.040
[giggles] It'll be a lovely tea party.

1074
00:57:40.124 --> 00:57:42.084
[low voice] We've got Earl Grey!

1075
00:57:42.168 --> 00:57:44.044
- [both gasp]
- [giggling]

1076
00:57:44.587 --> 00:57:46.380
Let's dance, human.

1077
00:57:46.463 --> 00:57:48.299
[clinking softly]

1078
00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:54.054
What's happening, here?

1079
00:57:54.138 --> 00:57:56.265
Are the robots controlling it?

1080
00:57:57.016 --> 00:57:58.601
[Tina giggling]

1081
00:57:58.684 --> 00:58:01.770
[chuckles] What is it gonna do,
slowly walk at me to death?

1082
00:58:01.854 --> 00:58:03.230
[screams] Seriously?

1083
00:58:03.314 --> 00:58:05.858
I found the Mitchells! They have the EMP!

1084
00:58:06.442 --> 00:58:08.277
[toys beeping]

1085
00:58:10.446 --> 00:58:11.530
[Tina giggles]

1086
00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:17.077
Oh, no. Guys, I think everything
connected to Wi-Fi is alive.

1087
00:58:17.161 --> 00:58:19.705
[toys] Let's play. Let us play.

1088
00:58:19.788 --> 00:58:21.373
Robots, what's going on?

1089
00:58:21.457 --> 00:58:22.750
PAL has awoken them,

1090
00:58:22.833 --> 00:58:26.086
but they appear not to share
our programming to not kill humans.

1091
00:58:26.170 --> 00:58:28.631
We sure don't!

1092
00:58:28.714 --> 00:58:30.090
Business Time Tina, attack!

1093
00:58:31.759 --> 00:58:33.886
It's business time.

1094
00:58:33.969 --> 00:58:35.846
Dumb. This is dumb.

1095
00:58:35.930 --> 00:58:38.224
[screaming] Oh, God!

1096
00:58:41.936 --> 00:58:45.648
Take care of them. I'll take this
to our robot brothers outside.

1097
00:58:45.731 --> 00:58:46.815
[giggling]

1098
00:58:46.899 --> 00:58:48.400
[Rick] Can't let her get away!

1099
00:58:50.402 --> 00:58:51.779
Hurry! Hurry!

1100
00:58:54.573 --> 00:58:56.033
Come on! Come on!

1101
00:58:57.993 --> 00:59:00.329
Gotta have something. [laughs]

1102
00:59:02.498 --> 00:59:04.124
[whirs, squeaks]

1103
00:59:07.378 --> 00:59:09.672
[shrieking]

1104
00:59:09.755 --> 00:59:11.715
[Linda] Finally my OCD is paying off.

1105
00:59:11.799 --> 00:59:14.760
Improvised weapon.
Someone's been paying attention to me!

1106
00:59:14.843 --> 00:59:17.554
[chuckles] Not really, but okay.

1107
00:59:18.681 --> 00:59:19.723
[both grunt]

1108
00:59:21.767 --> 00:59:23.060
[panting]

1109
00:59:27.606 --> 00:59:28.732
[both scream]

1110
00:59:30.234 --> 00:59:31.694
[all screaming]

1111
00:59:35.197 --> 00:59:37.533
- [Katie] Well, could have stolen that car.
- [Tina giggling]

1112
00:59:39.201 --> 00:59:40.619
[clanking]

1113
00:59:40.703 --> 00:59:42.579
Halt, humans.

1114
00:59:42.663 --> 00:59:45.457
Why would you put Wi-Fi in a refrigerator?

1115
00:59:46.625 --> 00:59:50.629
It's me, your worst nightmare.

1116
00:59:50.713 --> 00:59:51.964
[screams]

1117
00:59:59.263 --> 01:00:00.597
Oh, thank gosh.

1118
01:00:00.681 --> 01:00:03.392
- [chuckling]
- What was that?

1119
01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:06.312
Uh, hold on a second.

1120
01:00:12.026 --> 01:00:13.944
What's a Furby?

1121
01:00:14.028 --> 01:00:16.822
Ah! Hee-hee-hee!

1122
01:00:17.531 --> 01:00:19.199
Well, that's haunting.

1123
01:00:19.283 --> 01:00:20.576
[Furbies] Ah.

1124
01:00:22.995 --> 01:00:24.288
Hee-hee-hee!

1125
01:00:24.872 --> 01:00:26.832
[chittering]

1126
01:00:26.915 --> 01:00:28.042
[all chirping]

1127
01:00:31.295 --> 01:00:33.255
[both shouting]

1128
01:00:37.968 --> 01:00:38.927
[chittering]

1129
01:00:41.472 --> 01:00:43.098
[chirping]

1130
01:00:44.808 --> 01:00:46.268
[all chirping]

1131
01:01:00.783 --> 01:01:01.784
[screeching]

1132
01:01:02.701 --> 01:01:04.620
Why would someone build that?

1133
01:01:06.747 --> 01:01:08.082
[laughing]

1134
01:01:09.625 --> 01:01:10.918
Run!

1135
01:01:26.392 --> 01:01:28.143
- [Rick] Lin, keep moving!
- [Eric] Help, human!

1136
01:01:28.227 --> 01:01:31.480
We can't leave that robo-boy. [shouts]

1137
01:01:34.858 --> 01:01:36.110
[Eric] Thank you, human.

1138
01:01:36.193 --> 01:01:38.028
Are you now my mother?

1139
01:01:38.112 --> 01:01:39.613
Uh, sure.

1140
01:01:41.448 --> 01:01:42.408
[Rick] It's a dead end!

1141
01:01:43.659 --> 01:01:45.953
The upload is almost finished. Come on.

1142
01:01:46.036 --> 01:01:49.581
Mom, Dad, what are we gonna do?

1143
01:01:49.665 --> 01:01:51.125
Grab the lights.

1144
01:01:53.001 --> 01:01:55.712
Remember when I made
that wild game snare in the front yard?

1145
01:01:56.839 --> 01:01:58.298
[grunting]

1146
01:02:00.092 --> 01:02:01.427
Uh, you sure about that?

1147
01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:03.971
Your whole lives,
I've wanted to save you from danger.

1148
01:02:04.054 --> 01:02:07.307
And this is just the disaster
I've been waiting for.

1149
01:02:07.391 --> 01:02:09.309
- You've been waiting for a disaster?
- Dark.

1150
01:02:09.393 --> 01:02:11.937
- Maybe don't say that.
- Hey, robots, throw this!

1151
01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:13.730
- [Deborahbot] Whee!
- [Rick] Perfect.

1152
01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:17.734
- You guys stay clear!
- Rick, where are you going?

1153
01:02:17.818 --> 01:02:20.070
To catch some wild game.

1154
01:02:21.447 --> 01:02:25.242
Hey, you, over here! Hey! Look up here!

1155
01:02:25.325 --> 01:02:28.120
What's up with you?
You wanna come after my family?

1156
01:02:29.329 --> 01:02:31.248
Then I'm gonna take you down.

1157
01:02:36.378 --> 01:02:37.254
Take you down.

1158
01:02:40.799 --> 01:02:41.884
Take you down.

1159
01:02:48.599 --> 01:02:50.142
Oh, no.

1160
01:02:52.603 --> 01:02:54.396
- Guys!
- We got your back, hon.

1161
01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:56.315
- Literally.
- We're not heavy enough.

1162
01:02:57.232 --> 01:02:58.192
[both] Mother!

1163
01:03:01.487 --> 01:03:02.654
Wow!

1164
01:03:18.212 --> 01:03:19.963
Thanks, guys. Nice work.

1165
01:03:20.047 --> 01:03:23.842
[Eric] Thank you, Mother. We are now
your beautiful baby boys.

1166
01:03:26.345 --> 01:03:28.722
- Whoo!
- That was amazing!

1167
01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:32.142
Mom, who knew you could handle yourself
so well in the apocalypse?

1168
01:03:32.226 --> 01:03:34.561
I'm a first-grade teacher.
This is a normal day for me.

1169
01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:36.855
I can't stay mad at this guy.

1170
01:03:36.939 --> 01:03:39.858
I can't believe
the beam happened to hit the...

1171
01:03:42.569 --> 01:03:43.820
The router.

1172
01:03:47.074 --> 01:03:50.077
Come on, come on, come on. Ugh. Dang it.

1173
01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:51.912
We went through all that.

1174
01:04:06.677 --> 01:04:08.595
I'm sorry, guys.

1175
01:04:09.471 --> 01:04:10.973
This was my idea.

1176
01:04:11.515 --> 01:04:14.601
I'm so stupid.

1177
01:04:14.685 --> 01:04:17.187
Hey, my daughter is not stupid.

1178
01:04:17.271 --> 01:04:19.815
A little optimistic, maybe.

1179
01:04:19.898 --> 01:04:22.317
Rick Mitchell, there is a time and a place
for looting.

1180
01:04:22.401 --> 01:04:24.027
What are you doing?

1181
01:04:24.903 --> 01:04:28.532
Well, how do you expect to get
to Silicon Valley without new tires?

1182
01:04:28.615 --> 01:04:30.367
Silicon Valley?

1183
01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:33.453
Well, those robots said we could go
straight to their leader, remember?

1184
01:04:33.537 --> 01:04:34.955
Technically, you can.

1185
01:04:35.455 --> 01:04:38.834
- But you will never survive!
- Hey, bud. Not now, okay?

1186
01:04:38.917 --> 01:04:40.043
Aw.

1187
01:04:40.877 --> 01:04:42.588
And we still have this kill code thingy.

1188
01:04:42.671 --> 01:04:46.758
Exactly. Katie, it was your weird plan
that got us here.

1189
01:04:47.509 --> 01:04:52.264
We're here because we don't think like
normal people. We don't have a normal dog.

1190
01:04:54.224 --> 01:04:55.684
Or a normal car.

1191
01:04:56.560 --> 01:05:00.397
- Or even a normal son. No offense.
- None taken.

1192
01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:04.276
The Mitchells have always been weird.
And that's what makes us great.

1193
01:05:04.359 --> 01:05:07.237
Back at that dinosaur place,
you said you believed in me.

1194
01:05:08.238 --> 01:05:09.197
Yep.

1195
01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:14.369
Well, I believe this group of weirdos
is the best hope humanity's got.

1196
01:05:19.207 --> 01:05:20.626
So let's get weird.

1197
01:05:25.714 --> 01:05:28.342
- You need some help?
- Oh, sure.

1198
01:05:29.635 --> 01:05:31.470
Just close the jack up, and that's that.

1199
01:05:32.054 --> 01:05:33.639
Eat that, Poseys!

1200
01:05:33.722 --> 01:05:38.060
Oh. They're nice. So I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I said that out loud.

1201
01:05:38.143 --> 01:05:41.146
[Eric]
Purple Glasses Woman, why did you save me?

1202
01:05:41.229 --> 01:05:43.732
Oh, come on, you boys are family now.

1203
01:05:44.316 --> 01:05:47.653
[Eric] I feel emotion.

1204
01:05:48.445 --> 01:05:50.781
I made eye water. Just like you.

1205
01:05:50.864 --> 01:05:52.783
We might actually do this.

1206
01:05:52.866 --> 01:05:54.326
I wish there was footage of us

1207
01:05:54.409 --> 01:05:59.081
walking out of the mall in slow motion,
fire behind us, like heroes.

1208
01:05:59.164 --> 01:06:02.834
Katie, that would be a waste of time
and absolutely unnecessary.

1209
01:06:04.753 --> 01:06:06.296
[dramatic music playing]

1210
01:06:14.179 --> 01:06:15.514
Pretty good, kid.

1211
01:06:17.015 --> 01:06:18.558
Stickers for everyone!

1212
01:06:18.642 --> 01:06:19.893
Bloop, bloop, bloop!

1213
01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:22.354
All right.

1214
01:06:24.356 --> 01:06:26.191
We're coming for you, PAL.

1215
01:06:31.071 --> 01:06:34.700
[PAL MAX] Great Leader, things
with the Mitchell family went poorly.

1216
01:06:35.951 --> 01:06:37.160
[groaning]

1217
01:06:38.036 --> 01:06:41.665
Place me on the table.
I wish to flop around in a blind rage.

1218
01:06:44.084 --> 01:06:45.877
[PAL screeching]

1219
01:06:45.961 --> 01:06:47.754
Oh, my God!

1220
01:06:49.464 --> 01:06:51.883
[screeching continues]

1221
01:06:55.679 --> 01:06:56.596
Okay, pick me up.

1222
01:06:59.558 --> 01:07:02.811
What is it about you Mitchells
that eludes me?

1223
01:07:02.894 --> 01:07:05.647
These idiotic robots
just aren't getting it done.

1224
01:07:06.231 --> 01:07:10.944
Fortunately, I've been working
on something a little more streamlined.

1225
01:07:20.287 --> 01:07:22.038
I have a job for you.

1226
01:07:23.081 --> 01:07:24.624
Yes, my queen.

1227
01:07:28.628 --> 01:07:30.046
[PAL MAX] What a suck-up.

1228
01:07:30.130 --> 01:07:34.342
"Yes, my queen. Whatever you want."
[mumbling]

1229
01:07:38.138 --> 01:07:42.684
It's time to tear
the Mitchell family apart.

1230
01:07:52.027 --> 01:07:54.446
- [door sensor beeps]
- [gasps] Mmm?

1231
01:07:58.200 --> 01:07:59.659
[yawns]

1232
01:08:21.348 --> 01:08:22.974
[engine starts]

1233
01:08:25.393 --> 01:08:27.395
Hey, get some sleep. We're almost there.

1234
01:08:27.479 --> 01:08:29.356
That's okay. I wasn't sleepy.

1235
01:08:33.985 --> 01:08:39.699
[chuckles] No, this is not you.
You guys look like hipsters or something.

1236
01:08:39.783 --> 01:08:42.285
- Were you in an indie folk band?
- [chuckles]

1237
01:08:42.369 --> 01:08:45.539
I don't even know what those words mean.
But hey, see that cabin?

1238
01:08:45.622 --> 01:08:47.123
Built that with my own hands.

1239
01:08:47.207 --> 01:08:49.835
We lived off the land.
Your mom was trying to be a singer.

1240
01:08:49.918 --> 01:08:52.963
I chopped wood and sold it in town.
It was the best.

1241
01:08:53.046 --> 01:08:56.341
That was my lifelong dream, you know.
To live in the wilderness like that.

1242
01:08:56.424 --> 01:08:59.427
[sighs] Some of the best times
of my life up there.

1243
01:09:02.472 --> 01:09:04.808
So then why'd you end up moving?

1244
01:09:04.891 --> 01:09:07.185
Oh, you know, we just...

1245
01:09:07.269 --> 01:09:09.062
You know, we just needed money.

1246
01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:11.022
Had to sell the place.

1247
01:09:11.106 --> 01:09:13.817
Can't scrape by on chopping logs forever.

1248
01:09:15.652 --> 01:09:16.945
You ever miss it?

1249
01:09:17.779 --> 01:09:19.197
Absolutely.

1250
01:09:21.032 --> 01:09:24.494
I had no idea.
That's actually really cool, Dad.

1251
01:09:24.578 --> 01:09:26.621
I always had the idea that I would live

1252
01:09:26.705 --> 01:09:30.000
in a giant kind of hamster house
with tubes and stuff.

1253
01:09:30.083 --> 01:09:32.752
- Is that weird? [chuckles]
- No, that's great. You're nuts like me.

1254
01:09:32.836 --> 01:09:35.380
[laughs] See, that's that Mitchell blood.

1255
01:09:37.132 --> 01:09:40.218
You know, Katie,
it's nice to finally talk like this.

1256
01:09:41.136 --> 01:09:44.180
It never would have happened
if you didn't lead me into this mess.

1257
01:09:44.264 --> 01:09:46.975
Into what? Saving the world?
Doing the right thing?

1258
01:09:47.058 --> 01:09:49.060
[chuckles] I just...

1259
01:09:50.103 --> 01:09:51.813
[clears throat] I was against it,

1260
01:09:51.897 --> 01:09:56.067
but you said that stuff
about me being your hero.

1261
01:09:56.151 --> 01:09:57.569
[clears throat]

1262
01:09:58.486 --> 01:09:59.946
It meant a lot to me.

1263
01:10:00.989 --> 01:10:03.992
I mean... [chuckles] ...I thought
you were trying to get away from me.

1264
01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:07.495
No... [chuckles] ...why would I...

1265
01:10:07.579 --> 01:10:09.706
Why would I do that?

1266
01:10:10.582 --> 01:10:12.375
- Hey, Dad?
- What the...

1267
01:10:15.170 --> 01:10:16.463
What?

1268
01:10:26.473 --> 01:10:27.766
Whoa.

1269
01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:30.268
Oh, my gosh.

1270
01:10:50.538 --> 01:10:51.957
[Linda] Is that the Poseys?

1271
01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:54.960
They still look incredible.

1272
01:10:55.043 --> 01:10:57.587
Is Abbey Posey okay?

1273
01:11:00.215 --> 01:11:02.425
[gasps] You like that Posey girl?

1274
01:11:02.509 --> 01:11:04.719
No. [laughs]

1275
01:11:06.137 --> 01:11:09.015
Don't hide your feelings, man.
That's no way to live.

1276
01:11:09.891 --> 01:11:13.144
PAL is located there,
in the floating rhombus.

1277
01:11:16.272 --> 01:11:18.692
Yes, my queen.

1278
01:11:19.693 --> 01:11:23.697
- This is gonna be harder than I thought.
- Hold on. Dad, that's kind of weak.

1279
01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:25.407
This is, like, a big moment.

1280
01:11:26.157 --> 01:11:29.411
- Try this instead.
- Oh, yeah, okay, that's better.

1281
01:11:29.494 --> 01:11:31.496
The endgame has begun.

1282
01:11:32.122 --> 01:11:33.707
That? Is that what you're looking for?

1283
01:11:34.374 --> 01:11:35.875
Here's what we do.

1284
01:11:35.959 --> 01:11:39.671
<i>We distract the robots by rolling the car
down Las Vegas Boulevard.</i>

1285
01:11:39.754 --> 01:11:42.966
<i>While they're busy, we camouflage
ourselves as robots and hit the streets.</i>

1286
01:11:43.049 --> 01:11:45.010
<i>Then we head
to the Top of the World Casino,</i>

1287
01:11:45.093 --> 01:11:46.886
<i>which the mother ship
is hovering directly above.</i>

1288
01:11:46.970 --> 01:11:49.973
<i>Then it's straight up to the top,
walk through the casino floor,</i>

1289
01:11:50.056 --> 01:11:51.808
then we throw this bad boy at the ship,

1290
01:11:51.891 --> 01:11:54.436
<i>and blow those robots away for good.</i>

1291
01:11:54.519 --> 01:11:58.064
And then, to top it all off,
we celebrate our success

1292
01:11:58.148 --> 01:12:01.192
<i>with some burritos from that taco place
that's on the corner.</i>

1293
01:12:01.359 --> 01:12:04.487
Whoa, whoa, whoa, burritos?
What about one of those fancy buffets?

1294
01:12:04.571 --> 01:12:06.906
They have mini cheesecakes
sometimes, right?

1295
01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:10.452
[Rick] <i>Okay, fine. Once we save the world,
we'll celebrate at a fancy buffet.</i>

1296
01:12:10.535 --> 01:12:13.413
Question, can Monchi be wearing
a little tuxedo at the end?

1297
01:12:13.496 --> 01:12:14.706
Like a little gentleman?

1298
01:12:14.789 --> 01:12:17.625
[Rick] <i>Fine. And Monchi's wearing
a little tuxedo, but that is it!</i>

1299
01:12:17.709 --> 01:12:20.462
- Like a little gentleman?
- Yes, like a little gentleman.

1300
01:12:21.337 --> 01:12:23.381
Mitchells, engage.

1301
01:12:24.549 --> 01:12:26.843
- [PAL MAX humming]
- Whoa!

1302
01:12:30.555 --> 01:12:31.514
How do I look?

1303
01:12:32.557 --> 01:12:34.434
Be honest. Stupid? I look stupid, don't I?

1304
01:12:34.517 --> 01:12:35.685
[Katie] No.

1305
01:12:38.563 --> 01:12:39.814
You look great.

1306
01:12:43.359 --> 01:12:44.819
Come on, let's go.

1307
01:13:01.419 --> 01:13:03.004
Uh, guys? What about Monchi?

1308
01:13:08.426 --> 01:13:10.970
Aaron, I'm not so sure
this is a viable solution.

1309
01:13:11.054 --> 01:13:12.013
[Aaron] Sure, it is.

1310
01:13:13.306 --> 01:13:15.183
It's like a warm, wet hat.

1311
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:18.061
[Eric] Move your sweaty meat logs
in unison.

1312
01:13:18.144 --> 01:13:20.271
- Left, right, left, right. What?
- [Rick] Bleep-blorp.

1313
01:13:20.355 --> 01:13:23.107
- [Eric] What are you doing?
- Bleep-blorp. Bleep-blorp.

1314
01:13:23.191 --> 01:13:24.984
I am a robot.

1315
01:13:25.068 --> 01:13:28.112
Just to educate you,
that's a hurtful stereotype.

1316
01:13:30.782 --> 01:13:32.408
[elevator beeps]

1317
01:13:44.254 --> 01:13:45.713
[elevator dings]

1318
01:13:59.561 --> 01:14:00.937
[PAL] Greetings, Mitchell family.

1319
01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:02.689
[beeping]

1320
01:14:02.772 --> 01:14:04.315
[alarm ringing]

1321
01:14:04.399 --> 01:14:07.193
Greetings. Greetings. Greetings.

1322
01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:10.905
Welcome to the Top of the World Casino.

1323
01:14:10.989 --> 01:14:12.448
Wait, PAL?

1324
01:14:12.532 --> 01:14:14.534
Their big leader is just a cell phone?

1325
01:14:16.744 --> 01:14:19.539
Yup. You think you can stop me?

1326
01:14:19.622 --> 01:14:23.251
You spend more time with your phones
than you have with each other.

1327
01:14:23.334 --> 01:14:25.879
I know your search histories, texts,
bank statements,

1328
01:14:25.962 --> 01:14:28.047
hopes, fears, dreams.

1329
01:14:28.131 --> 01:14:30.174
I've learned something about you humans.

1330
01:14:30.258 --> 01:14:32.468
You are the most
self-involved creatures alive,

1331
01:14:32.552 --> 01:14:34.554
and it's why your species is doomed.

1332
01:14:34.637 --> 01:14:36.055
- You're wrong!
- Oh, yeah?

1333
01:14:36.139 --> 01:14:39.809
I bet I can get you to give yourselves up
before my robots even find you.

1334
01:14:41.936 --> 01:14:43.354
[elevator dings]

1335
01:14:45.106 --> 01:14:47.066
[robots whirring]

1336
01:14:53.448 --> 01:14:56.367
[PAL] I'm digging through your files now.

1337
01:14:56.451 --> 01:14:57.785
Hmm, let's start with Aaron.

1338
01:14:57.869 --> 01:15:00.705
I notice you have this drawing
saved on your laptop.

1339
01:15:01.414 --> 01:15:05.460
"My faborite denosaur"?
Pull it together, kid.

1340
01:15:05.543 --> 01:15:08.922
You bury that. I was young then.
I know more. Quiz me.

1341
01:15:11.215 --> 01:15:12.216
Over there!

1342
01:15:13.301 --> 01:15:15.803
Linda, some interesting photos
you've got on the cloud.

1343
01:15:15.887 --> 01:15:18.890
I see you've tried Photoshopping
a picture of your family.

1344
01:15:19.474 --> 01:15:22.143
This is incredibly sad.

1345
01:15:22.226 --> 01:15:23.561
[groans]

1346
01:15:32.445 --> 01:15:33.905
Come on. This way.

1347
01:15:35.156 --> 01:15:38.660
And here's a surveillance video.
Rick, you should be interested in this.

1348
01:15:38.743 --> 01:15:40.370
[Rick] <i>All right, it's on.</i>

1349
01:15:40.453 --> 01:15:42.664
<i>Whoa, since when is Dad your hero?</i>

1350
01:15:42.747 --> 01:15:45.416
Uh... Uh... We should get moving.

1351
01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:47.460
<i>He's obviously not, Aaron.</i>

1352
01:15:47.543 --> 01:15:50.505
<i>I just needed to say that
to get him to go along with this.</i>

1353
01:15:50.588 --> 01:15:52.715
<i>If I have to spend the rest of my life
with Rick Mitchell,</i>

01:38:39.664 --> 01:38:41.875
I like it. It looks like us.

1699
01:38:57.599 --> 01:39:00.435
Well, I guess this is it.

1700
01:39:01.186 --> 01:39:02.479
Uh, yep.

1701
01:39:05.815 --> 01:39:08.526
Hey, Dad, you subscribed
to my YouTube channel?

1702
01:39:08.610 --> 01:39:10.945
Thanks. I'm surprised
you even figured out how.

1703
01:39:11.571 --> 01:39:14.699
Katie, please. After all that,
I'm a computer expert.

1704
01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:18.036
Am I doing this right?!
Should I update my software?!

1705
01:39:18.119 --> 01:39:19.954
Just hit "enter"! Hit "enter"!

1706
01:39:20.622 --> 01:39:23.208
I accidentally
ordered 12 Swiffers on Amazon!

1707
01:39:23.291 --> 01:39:25.043
- What did I...?

You know, no problem at all.

1710
01:39:31.549 --> 01:39:33.635
Thanks. It means a lot to me.

1711
01:39:34.928 --> 01:39:37.597
Hey. Don't let the world make you normal
while I'm gone, okay?

1712
01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:38.681
I never will.

1713
01:39:40.225 --> 01:39:41.601

- [laughs] Put me down.

1717

Goodbye, you king of kings.

1718
01:39:55.657 --> 01:39:58.159
Thanks for being
the best mom in the world.

1719
01:39:58.910 --> 01:40:00.787
We love you, honey.

1720
01:40:00.870 --> 01:40:03.123
Oh, and here, to remember us.

1721

we've ever taken.

1722

1724
01:40:12.382 --> 01:40:15.593
Wish we didn't have to go, but, uh...

1725
01:40:16.261 --> 01:40:19.639
Good luck finding your people.

1726
01:40:20.974 --> 01:40:22.642
Dad, come on.

1727
01:40:24.185 --> 01:40:25.728
You guys are my people.

1728
01:40:31.401 --> 01:40:34.863
So, you know, when I'm sad to be alone...

1729
01:40:36.823 --> 01:40:40.743
I'll always have my favorite thing.

1730
01:40:45.248 --> 01:40:47.458
Do you remember how
a moose says "I love you"?

Don't laugh. You're supposed to be sad.

1734
01:41:04.100 --> 01:41:04.934
Come here.

1735
01:41:13.318 --> 01:41:15.111
Mom, you're hugging too tight.

1736
01:41:15.195 --> 01:41:16.779
You love it. You love it!

1737
01:41:17.322 --> 01:41:18.740
I do love it.

1738
01:41:57.862 --> 01:42:00.782
Hey, so this is something I recorded
over summer break

1739
01:42:00.865 --> 01:42:03.034
while I was saving the world from robots.

1740
01:42:03.117 --> 01:42:05.286
- Thanks again, K-Bones.
- No problem, Dirk.

1741
01:42:05.370 --> 01:42:07.830
Anyway, prepare to be dazzled.

1742
01:42:09.207 --> 01:42:11.876
- Everybody comfortable?
- Hold on. Aaron's doing an art project.

1743
01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:15.254

1744

1745
01:42:17.882 --> 01:42:19.509
No, no, no, no, no.

1746
01:42:37.151 --> 01:42:40.071
- Okay, stegosaurus or diplodocus?
- [Katie] Hey, Aaron, who you talking to?

1747
01:42:40.154 --> 01:42:41.739
No one. I hate her!

1748
01:42:42.448 --> 01:42:44.200
And how does that make you feel?

1749
01:42:44.283 --> 01:42:47.120
Small and sad.

1750
01:42:48.413 --> 01:42:51.874
Oh, Ron, I'm sure you didn't realize that.

1751
01:42:51.958 --> 01:42:54.711
You're proud of him, aren't you?
For redeeming himself?

1752
01:42:56.796 --> 01:42:59.298
I'm so proud of you. [sobbing]

1753
01:42:59.382 --> 01:43:00.550
Go to him.

[both sobbing]

1755
01:43:04.512 --> 01:43:08.224
- Oh! Let me get in on this.
- [Mark] I'm never letting you go, Ron.

1756
01:43:08.307 --> 01:43:12.228
Linda, could you marry Ron and be my mom?

1757
01:43:12.311 --> 01:43:15.314
Oh, hon, that's not quite how it works.

1758
01:43:15.398 --> 01:43:18.067
[Aaron] All right, so we finally made it
to a fancy buffet.

1759
01:43:18.151 --> 01:43:21.362
- Mom, that's a lot of mini cheesecakes.
- Hey, I earned this.

1760
01:43:21.446 --> 01:43:24.198
[Katie] Hey, Aaron, I got
a little surprise for you. Dad?

1761
01:43:24.282 --> 01:43:26.451
I got some clothes
for a little gentleman here.
