1
00:00:02,949 --> 00:00:05,782
AS I DANCED, THE BEAUTIFUL LADY
WAS INTOXICATED.

2
00:00:05,852 --> 00:00:08,286
AS I DANCED,
THE SHINING MOON RESOUNDED.

3
00:00:08,355 --> 00:00:11,153
MAKING LOVE,
A GOD DESCENDS.

4
00:00:11,224 --> 00:00:14,091
THE DAWN BREAKS AND A WHITE'S
THRUSH SINGS SORROWFULLY.

5
00:00:14,161 --> 00:00:16,789
THE DISTANT GOD
MAY GIVE US BLESSING.

6
00:00:24,237 --> 00:00:25,966
...in the C-1 3 district
of Newport City.

7
00:00:26,073 --> 00:00:29,736
The airspace over this area
will be closed. Repeat:

8
00:00:29,843 --> 00:00:32,710
To all patrolling air units.
A 208 is in progress...

9
00:00:32,846 --> 00:00:34,746
...in the C-1 3 district
of Newport City.

10
00:00:34,848 --> 00:00:37,908
The airspace over this area
will be closed. Repeat...

11
00:01:12,886 --> 00:01:14,945
There's nothing to worry about.

12
00:01:15,055 --> 00:01:17,990
You can try it again
once you're in our country.

13
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:20,116
"Try it again"?

14
00:01:20,327 --> 00:01:23,160
Just as there's no such thing
as a bug-free program...

15
00:01:23,263 --> 00:01:27,199
...there's no program
that can't be debugged. Am I wrong?

16
00:01:27,334 --> 00:01:29,325
You don't understand.

17
00:01:29,436 --> 00:01:32,098
We still don't know
if it really is a bug.

18
00:01:32,205 --> 00:01:34,469
Project 2501 's
original purpose was--

19
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:37,635
Major, Section 6
is ready to move in.

20
00:01:39,746 --> 00:01:41,941
- Major!
- I hear you.

21
00:01:43,283 --> 00:01:46,184
There's a lot of static
in your brain.

22
00:01:46,253 --> 00:01:48,380
It's that time of the month.

23
00:01:57,798 --> 00:02:00,699
Won't there be trouble if Section 9
butts in on Section 6's operation?

24
00:02:00,767 --> 00:02:02,701
That diplomat's a pretty
well-known bastard.

25
00:02:02,803 --> 00:02:05,966
Even if they catch him there,
all they can do is deport him.

26
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:11,671
We're the only ones
who can get our hands dirty.

27
00:02:11,812 --> 00:02:14,110
They're moving. Take us over
to the extraction point.

28
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,049
What? The police?

29
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:09,891
Stop it! Who told you to
open fire?! Drop your guns!

30
00:03:14,107 --> 00:03:17,736
I have diplomatic immunity!
Let me see who's in charge!

31
00:03:17,844 --> 00:03:20,074
Transporting a listed programmer
out of the country...

32
00:03:20,213 --> 00:03:22,738
...violates our
arms export treaty.

33
00:03:22,816 --> 00:03:26,980
I could also have you
charged with kidnapping.

34
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,815
Give the man up.

35
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:31,517
I'm afraid not. He's applied
for political asylum with us...

36
00:03:31,591 --> 00:03:34,287
...and he's already signed
a statement to that effect!

37
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:36,761
- When?!
- I don't have to tell you.

38
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:39,355
By right of international law,
my country can...

39
00:03:39,499 --> 00:03:41,899
...offer him protection
and right of safe passage.

40
00:03:42,936 --> 00:03:45,370
The document is on file
at our embassy.

41
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:47,269
I'll transfer a copy to you
in a few days.

42
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,774
Are you sure about this?
They won't take you back alive.

43
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,741
I must ask that you
watch what you say.

44
00:03:51,845 --> 00:03:54,405
Our country is
a peace-Ioving democracy.

45
00:03:54,481 --> 00:03:55,846
Is that a fact?

46
00:03:58,618 --> 00:04:00,677
Out the window! Shoot!

47
00:04:10,797 --> 00:04:13,231
Thermoptic camouflage...

48
00:09:00,153 --> 00:09:02,678
This is a rare pleasure,
Mr. Aramaki.

49
00:09:02,789 --> 00:09:05,553
What can the Foreign Ministry
do for Section 9?

50
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,593
What are these secret talks
you've scheduled with...

51
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,753
...the Gavel Republic
for tomorrow?

52
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:11,763
The usual. Foreign aid.

53
00:09:11,865 --> 00:09:14,766
The new government reopened
the request after the revolution.

54
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:17,428
They claim to be
more democratic...

55
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:20,266
...but they'll probably be
as bad as the last bunch.

56
00:09:20,406 --> 00:09:22,897
Giving them money
they don't earn will help nobody.

57
00:09:22,976 --> 00:09:24,637
They consider it reparation
for past exploitation and won't thank--

58
00:09:24,711 --> 00:09:26,975
And what will the government do?

59
00:09:27,046 --> 00:09:29,537
The problem is that
we have the leader of...

60
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:32,379
...the old junta here
looking for political asylum.

61
00:09:32,452 --> 00:09:34,249
Colonel Maless, right?

62
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,414
So do we throw him out
and grant them the aid?

63
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:40,789
Or do we publicly recognize him
as a refugee and cut the aid?

64
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,328
Not an easy decision to make.

65
00:09:44,364 --> 00:09:47,162
Personally, if I could find
a politically acceptable reason...

66
00:09:47,267 --> 00:09:51,226
...I'd have the man deported
in a heartbeat.

67
00:09:58,878 --> 00:10:02,143
Oh, yes, thanks for your help
with that programmer defection.

68
00:10:02,215 --> 00:10:05,582
Nakamura over in Section 6
said he was grateful.

69
00:10:05,718 --> 00:10:08,915
After all, we in the diplomatic corps
have to keep our hands clean.

70
00:10:13,726 --> 00:10:15,785
Accessed.

71
00:10:15,862 --> 00:10:18,592
We've lost response.
How's her brainwave output look?

72
00:10:18,731 --> 00:10:22,167
Normal. Switching over
the virtual experience mode pattern.

73
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,329
The Foreign Minister's
interpreter.

74
00:10:26,406 --> 00:10:30,934
23 minutes ago, her cyber-brain
was hacked via telephone connection.

75
00:10:32,845 --> 00:10:35,473
Just as Foreign Intelligence
division predicted...

76
00:10:35,548 --> 00:10:37,641
...the Puppet Master
has begun to break into...

77
00:10:37,717 --> 00:10:39,184
...every terminal
on the network.

78
00:10:39,285 --> 00:10:41,685
Pattern analysis shows
a high probability that...

79
00:10:41,788 --> 00:10:44,848
...he's attempting to disrupt
secret talks with Gavel.

80
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,756
We've placed everyone attending
the talks under surveillance.

81
00:10:48,828 --> 00:10:51,228
Probably trying
to hack her ghost...

82
00:10:51,364 --> 00:10:54,356
...so she'll kill people
at the meeting.

83
00:10:54,434 --> 00:10:59,303
How long till he hacks through
her protection and reaches her ghost?

84
00:10:59,472 --> 00:11:04,068
He's using an old-style HA-3.
I'd say about two hours.

85
00:11:04,143 --> 00:11:06,202
After that, we'll have to cut
the line to eliminate all risk.

86
00:11:06,346 --> 00:11:09,611
Batou and Ishikawa are in a car,
tracing the signal.

87
00:11:09,716 --> 00:11:11,650
Rendezvous with them.

88
00:11:28,468 --> 00:11:31,869
The Puppet Master.
That phantom hacker, right?

89
00:11:31,971 --> 00:11:34,235
They think he's an American.

90
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:37,104
Age, sex, personal history...
everything about him is unknown.

91
00:11:37,243 --> 00:11:40,235
Since last winter he's been
mainly active in the EC.

92
00:11:40,346 --> 00:11:42,940
Internationally wanted
on dozens of charges of...

93
00:11:43,082 --> 00:11:45,778
...stock manipulation,
spying, political engineering...

94
00:11:45,885 --> 00:11:49,412
...terrorism, and violation
of cyber-brain privacy.

95
00:11:49,555 --> 00:11:52,718
He's ghost-hacked so many people
to carry out his crimes...

96
00:11:52,825 --> 00:11:55,259
...he's earned the code name
"The Puppet Master."

97
00:11:55,328 --> 00:11:58,092
This is the first instance of him
operating in this country.

98
00:11:58,197 --> 00:12:02,429
So if he's so hot,
why's he using an old HA-3?

99
00:12:02,502 --> 00:12:08,168
Well, a newer type would be
less detectable and be harder to trace.

100
00:12:08,307 --> 00:12:12,710
But it could also implicate the former
junta leader, Colonel Maless.

101
00:12:12,845 --> 00:12:17,805
So he's using an older type
to keep us from suspecting him.

102
00:12:17,917 --> 00:12:22,183
Or somebody else
wants us to think that.

103
00:12:22,288 --> 00:12:25,724
Maless may just be another pawn
in this whole thing.

104
00:12:25,858 --> 00:12:29,760
Now you're overthinking this.
There's no evidence of that.

105
00:12:29,896 --> 00:12:31,420
Evidence?

106
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:36,800
I just have a whisper...
A whisper from my ghost.

107
00:12:36,869 --> 00:12:39,895
By the way, are you
still using that revolver?

108
00:12:39,972 --> 00:12:42,770
Afraid both guns
in a two-man team'll jam up?

109
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,809
I like the Matever.

110
00:12:44,877 --> 00:12:46,868
Since I depend on your backup,
I think stopping power is...

111
00:12:46,946 --> 00:12:49,176
...more important than
personal preference.

112
00:12:49,248 --> 00:12:51,273
Especially since it's
my ass on the line.

113
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:54,012
Use the Zastaber instead.

114
00:12:54,153 --> 00:12:57,054
Major, I've been
meaning to ask you.

115
00:12:57,156 --> 00:13:00,887
Why'd you ask for a guy like me
to be transferred in from the police?

116
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,393
Because you're a guy like you.

117
00:13:02,528 --> 00:13:04,018
Huh?

118
00:13:04,163 --> 00:13:08,896
An honest cop with a clean record.
And you've got a regular family.

119
00:13:09,035 --> 00:13:12,698
With the exception of your
cyber-net implants, your brain's real.

120
00:13:12,772 --> 00:13:15,332
No matter how powerful
we may be fighting-wise...

121
00:13:15,408 --> 00:13:18,241
...a system where all the parts
react the same way...

122
00:13:18,344 --> 00:13:21,370
...is a system
with a fatal flaw.

123
00:13:22,415 --> 00:13:23,882
Like individual,
like organization.

124
00:13:23,983 --> 00:13:26,349
Overspecialization
leads to death.

125
00:13:26,486 --> 00:13:27,851
That's all.

126
00:13:39,432 --> 00:13:41,992
- Come on!
- All right!

127
00:13:46,906 --> 00:13:49,340
We're already 40 seconds
behind schedule!

128
00:13:49,442 --> 00:13:52,741
- Gimme five more seconds.
- Of all the lousy luck...

129
00:13:59,252 --> 00:14:00,810
Hey, sorry.

130
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,912
My last partner, the one
they busted for working without...

131
00:14:04,056 --> 00:14:06,388
...a permit,
was a better worker than you!

132
00:14:08,694 --> 00:14:11,219
You're actually trying
to ghost-hack your own wife...

133
00:14:11,364 --> 00:14:13,389
...just to see
what's on her mind?

134
00:14:13,533 --> 00:14:17,970
She doesn't have any time for me
and now she wants a divorce.

135
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:21,096
On top of that, my daughter,
my only child...

136
00:14:21,174 --> 00:14:23,472
...thinks I'm cheating
on her mother!

137
00:14:23,576 --> 00:14:26,977
So how'd you get your hands
on cracking software?

138
00:14:27,046 --> 00:14:31,915
From some programmer.
A really nice guy I met in a bar.

139
00:14:32,018 --> 00:14:34,953
I told him my wife's lawyer
was keeping me from seeing her...

140
00:14:35,021 --> 00:14:36,750
...and he said he'd help.

141
00:14:36,822 --> 00:14:39,586
Told me to access from different places
to keep from getting caught.

142
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:41,286
Smart guy, huh?

143
00:14:46,365 --> 00:14:48,526
Asshole! Ya tryin' to
get yourself killed?!

144
00:14:48,634 --> 00:14:51,626
Looks like we aren't
the only busy people out here.

145
00:14:55,508 --> 00:14:56,497
Nobody here.

146
00:14:56,576 --> 00:14:58,874
What's the point?
Even if we trace the calls...

147
00:14:58,978 --> 00:15:01,674
...the guy's already gone
by the time we get there.

148
00:15:01,781 --> 00:15:04,579
- Vicious cycle, huh?
- Quit complaining!

149
00:15:04,684 --> 00:15:07,084
Kusanagi and Togusa are headed
for the next expected hack point.

150
00:15:07,253 --> 00:15:09,414
You two look for something there.

151
00:15:09,488 --> 00:15:10,955
Look for what?

152
00:15:11,023 --> 00:15:12,957
Anything.

153
00:15:13,092 --> 00:15:15,287
Fuckin' old coot.
He tells us to snoop around?!

154
00:15:16,729 --> 00:15:18,822
Wait a sec.

155
00:15:18,965 --> 00:15:21,195
Damn. Missed him.

156
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,894
Hey, Pops. Did you see
a garbage truck go by here?

157
00:15:24,003 --> 00:15:25,937
Who wants to know?

158
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:27,666
Did you see it or not?

159
00:15:27,773 --> 00:15:31,402
Yeah, but they were gone
by the time I got my trash.

160
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:34,070
One was using the phone,
so I thought I had time--

161
00:15:36,983 --> 00:15:39,816
Uh, can you take this to them?

162
00:15:39,952 --> 00:15:43,911
A garbage truck? Of course.
They move every seven minutes.

163
00:15:44,156 --> 00:15:48,183
Control! Get me the trash
collection routes for that sector!

164
00:15:58,304 --> 00:16:01,000
There are eight garbage trucks
operating in the target area.

165
00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:05,500
Target is a type C
collection truck, #79.

166
00:16:07,947 --> 00:16:09,847
Let me drive.

167
00:16:16,188 --> 00:16:20,318
He may be in contact with someone else.
Observe, but don't move in!

168
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:22,450
Route data accessed.

169
00:16:22,528 --> 00:16:27,056
Hacking points traced and matched.
Target now stopped at next point.

170
00:16:28,868 --> 00:16:31,234
Confirm access via HA-3.

171
00:16:37,109 --> 00:16:38,872
Sorry, sorry.

172
00:16:38,978 --> 00:16:41,913
How about I do the trash
and you make the call on the next stop?

173
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:44,405
Okay?

174
00:16:44,483 --> 00:16:46,849
Leave me out
of your little crime spree.

175
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:49,444
Can't believe this
load of bullshit...

176
00:16:49,555 --> 00:16:52,854
- Do you have kids?
- Do I look like I do?

177
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:55,085
Then you couldn't understand.

178
00:16:55,161 --> 00:16:57,527
My daughter's my life.

179
00:16:57,596 --> 00:16:59,496
Take a look.
Isn't she just a little angel?

180
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,726
I hate looking at other
people's family albums.

181
00:17:06,305 --> 00:17:09,604
Yeah, truck 79.
Oh, boss. What's up?

182
00:17:10,643 --> 00:17:13,578
The cops were checking our routes?
You wanna know why?

183
00:17:13,646 --> 00:17:16,012
How should I know?!

184
00:17:19,418 --> 00:17:22,910
They spotted the hack!
I gotta warn my friend!

185
00:17:22,988 --> 00:17:25,479
We're gonna have to
skip our next stop!

186
00:17:25,658 --> 00:17:29,958
Target has deviated from route.
Increasing speed to next point.

187
00:17:30,062 --> 00:17:34,089
Is he on to us?
Didn't think he could see me.

188
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,896
My accessing the sanitation department
network may have tipped him off.

189
00:17:37,002 --> 00:17:38,867
Should've used a back door.

190
00:17:38,938 --> 00:17:40,872
Too late. Go for the collar.

191
00:17:45,845 --> 00:17:46,937
You can drive now.

192
00:18:50,342 --> 00:18:53,368
Jesus. He blew a perfectly good
armored van to shit.

193
00:18:53,446 --> 00:18:56,813
He hosed us with high-velocity AP
rounds! That car door's no cover!

194
00:18:56,949 --> 00:18:59,679
In a sub machinegun?
The guy must be nuts.

195
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,191
He's using
thermoptic camo too?!

196
00:19:16,268 --> 00:19:18,634
Keep after him!
I'll flank him from above!

197
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:23,133
Togusa, if you're still alive,
arrest those two garbage men.

198
00:19:23,209 --> 00:19:24,642
Roger.

199
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:28,940
This job just never lets up,
does it?

200
00:20:25,437 --> 00:20:27,667
Police! Everybody down!

201
00:22:28,627 --> 00:22:30,322
All finished?

202
00:23:23,482 --> 00:23:25,507
You all set?

203
00:23:25,584 --> 00:23:28,712
That's what you get when you
overload the ammo rating.

204
00:23:28,821 --> 00:23:33,281
Frame's bent all to hell.
The barrel's shot too.

205
00:23:33,425 --> 00:23:37,088
Doesn't matter if you arrest me.
I'm not gonna talk!

206
00:23:37,196 --> 00:23:39,096
Talk?!

207
00:23:40,966 --> 00:23:45,665
And what would I ask a guy who
doesn't even know his own name?!

208
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,708
Your mother's face.

209
00:23:49,808 --> 00:23:52,538
The place you grew up in.

210
00:23:52,611 --> 00:23:54,943
Memories of your childhood.

211
00:23:55,981 --> 00:23:58,472
Can you remember
any of those things?

212
00:24:05,991 --> 00:24:09,085
There's nothing sadder
than a puppet without a ghost.

213
00:24:09,228 --> 00:24:11,628
Especially the kind with red blood
running through them.

214
00:24:26,812 --> 00:24:29,280
We'll rush the place once the guys
in the helicopter are inside.

215
00:24:29,348 --> 00:24:32,112
Squad B goes around back,
the rest of you take the front.

216
00:24:33,152 --> 00:24:37,350
Saito, have your men
pull the plugs on all their cars.

217
00:24:37,489 --> 00:24:39,753
Begin recording.

218
00:24:42,728 --> 00:24:45,424
Message from HQ, sir.

219
00:24:45,497 --> 00:24:48,557
We've ID'ed the guy
the Major collared.

220
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:50,066
Go on.

221
00:24:50,202 --> 00:24:52,796
Tsuan Gen Fang. Age: 28.

222
00:24:52,871 --> 00:24:57,399
Illegal alien.
Weapons violations. Three priors.

223
00:24:58,443 --> 00:25:03,005
Was hiding out with a militant
refugee group up till a month ago.

224
00:25:03,081 --> 00:25:06,482
One week ago,
because of his record...

225
00:25:06,585 --> 00:25:09,281
...he was contacted by a military
liaison in the Gavel embassy to...

226
00:25:09,354 --> 00:25:12,414
...attack the secret talks
we would be having with them.

227
00:25:12,491 --> 00:25:14,618
And the real story?

228
00:25:14,693 --> 00:25:19,721
Nickname: Corgi. Occupation:
a rather violent scrap dealer.

229
00:25:19,832 --> 00:25:21,766
Guess you could
call him a thug.

230
00:25:21,834 --> 00:25:25,361
We've checked the records
the local cops have on him...

231
00:25:26,638 --> 00:25:29,266
...but we can't find
any connection with Gavel.

232
00:25:30,275 --> 00:25:33,438
Another puppet from our friend
the Puppet Master.

233
00:25:33,512 --> 00:25:35,412
And what about Ishikawa?

234
00:25:35,514 --> 00:25:40,008
He's back. He's with Togusa
talking to that poor trashman.

235
00:25:42,454 --> 00:25:46,049
So what about the Puppet Master
on your end?

236
00:25:46,124 --> 00:25:49,525
How's he look to you?

237
00:25:53,265 --> 00:25:55,290
Like a puppet himself.

238
00:25:55,367 --> 00:25:58,461
- Squad B, in position.
- Squads A and C, ready.

239
00:25:58,604 --> 00:26:01,596
Ready to move in, sir.

240
00:26:01,707 --> 00:26:03,675
Move in.

241
00:26:06,612 --> 00:26:09,240
What do you mean,
a "virtual experience"?

242
00:26:09,348 --> 00:26:12,476
I mean your wife, your daughter,
the divorce, the affair...

243
00:26:12,551 --> 00:26:15,679
They're all fake memories.
Like a dream.

244
00:26:15,821 --> 00:26:20,690
Someone was using you to
ghost-hack a government official.

245
00:26:20,826 --> 00:26:23,488
No. That's impossible!

246
00:26:23,562 --> 00:26:25,928
I've been to your apartment.

247
00:26:25,998 --> 00:26:28,933
No one's there.
It's a one-room apartment.

248
00:26:29,034 --> 00:26:32,162
Yeah, I moved there
when we split up--

249
00:26:32,237 --> 00:26:36,003
You've been living there
for 1 0 years!

250
00:26:36,074 --> 00:26:38,599
You have no wife, no child.

251
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:41,838
Your family exists
only in your mind.

252
00:26:43,148 --> 00:26:47,812
Look. This is the picture
you showed to your partner.

253
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,354
Who is it of?

254
00:26:50,455 --> 00:26:54,255
But she was there.
My daughter--

255
00:26:54,326 --> 00:26:57,159
Smiling like an angel...

256
00:26:57,229 --> 00:26:59,663
What's your daughter's name?

257
00:26:59,765 --> 00:27:02,393
Where did you meet
your wife and when?

258
00:27:02,467 --> 00:27:05,561
How many years ago
did you get married?

259
00:27:05,637 --> 00:27:09,368
Who do you see in the picture?

260
00:27:11,677 --> 00:27:15,374
How do I get rid
of these fake memories?

261
00:27:15,447 --> 00:27:17,642
I'm sorry. With our
current technology...

262
00:27:17,749 --> 00:27:19,808
There've been two successful
deprogrammings...

263
00:27:19,918 --> 00:27:22,148
...but I can't
recommend it to you.

264
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,983
I'm really sorry.

265
00:27:24,056 --> 00:27:26,456
Virtual experiences, dreams...

266
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:32,121
All data that exists
is both reality and fantasy.

267
00:27:33,565 --> 00:27:36,591
Whichever it is, the data
a person collects in a lifetime...

268
00:27:36,668 --> 00:27:39,193
...is a tiny bit
compared to the whole.

269
00:28:50,876 --> 00:28:54,403
A cyborg who goes diving
in her spare time.

270
00:28:54,513 --> 00:28:58,711
That can't be a good sign.
When did you start doing this?

271
00:29:03,355 --> 00:29:07,382
Doesn't the ocean scare you?
If the floaters stopped working.

272
00:29:07,492 --> 00:29:11,451
Then I'd probably die.
Or would you dive in after me?

273
00:29:13,198 --> 00:29:15,826
No one forced you
to come out here with me.

274
00:29:15,901 --> 00:29:17,368
I just--

275
00:29:50,168 --> 00:29:53,501
So what's it feel like
when you go diving?

276
00:29:53,605 --> 00:29:56,972
Didn't you go through
underwater training?

277
00:29:57,042 --> 00:29:59,476
I'm not talking about
doing it in a damned pool.

278
00:30:00,011 --> 00:30:03,970
I feel fear. Anxiety.
Loneliness. Darkness.

279
00:30:04,082 --> 00:30:06,642
And perhaps even... hope.

280
00:30:06,718 --> 00:30:09,551
Hope?
In the darkness of the sea?

281
00:30:10,689 --> 00:30:12,680
As I float up
towards the surface...

282
00:30:12,757 --> 00:30:17,023
...I almost feel as though
I could change into something else.

283
00:30:23,068 --> 00:30:26,231
As though you want
to quit Section 9?

284
00:30:29,474 --> 00:30:32,534
Batou, how much of your
original body do you have left?

285
00:30:32,611 --> 00:30:33,976
Are you drunk?

286
00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:36,647
Convenient, isn't it?

287
00:30:36,715 --> 00:30:39,741
With the merest thought,
the chemical plants inside our bodies...

288
00:30:39,818 --> 00:30:44,016
...could metabolize all the alcohol
in our blood in about 1 0 seconds...

289
00:30:44,122 --> 00:30:47,285
...allowing us to sit here
drinking while on stand-by.

290
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:51,056
If a technological feat
is possible, man will do it.

291
00:30:51,129 --> 00:30:52,994
Almost as though it's wired
into the core of our being.

292
00:30:53,064 --> 00:30:56,431
Metabolic control.
Enhanced sensory perception.

293
00:30:56,535 --> 00:30:59,265
Improved reflexes
and muscle capacity.

294
00:30:59,337 --> 00:31:02,204
Vastly increased data
processing speed and capacity.

295
00:31:02,274 --> 00:31:06,938
All improvements thanks to our
cyber-brains and cyborg bodies.

296
00:31:07,045 --> 00:31:10,606
So what if we can't live
without high-level maintenance?

297
00:31:10,682 --> 00:31:12,650
We have nothing
to complain about.

298
00:31:12,717 --> 00:31:16,585
It doesn't mean we've sold
our souls to Section 9.

299
00:31:16,688 --> 00:31:20,021
We do have the right
to resign if we choose.

300
00:31:20,091 --> 00:31:22,992
Provided we give the government
back our cyborg shells...

301
00:31:23,061 --> 00:31:24,961
...and the memories they hold.

302
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:29,467
Just as there are many parts
needed to make a human human...

303
00:31:29,568 --> 00:31:32,662
...there's a remarkable number
of things needed to make...

304
00:31:32,737 --> 00:31:34,637
...an individual what they are.

305
00:31:34,739 --> 00:31:36,366
A face to distinguish
yourself from others.

306
00:31:36,441 --> 00:31:37,965
A voice you aren't
aware of yourself.

307
00:31:38,109 --> 00:31:39,974
The hand you see when you awaken.

308
00:31:40,045 --> 00:31:42,980
The memories of childhood,
the feelings for the future.

309
00:31:43,081 --> 00:31:45,948
That's not all.
There's the expanse of the data net...

310
00:31:46,051 --> 00:31:48,645
...my cyber-brain can access.

311
00:31:48,753 --> 00:31:50,687
All of that goes into
making me what I am.

312
00:31:50,755 --> 00:31:54,282
Giving rise to a consciousness
that I call "me."

313
00:31:54,392 --> 00:31:58,328
And simultaneously
confining "me" within set limits.

314
00:32:03,235 --> 00:32:06,671
Is that why you dive into the sea
with a body that only sinks?!

315
00:32:06,805 --> 00:32:10,172
What is it you see
in the water's darkness?

316
00:32:11,543 --> 00:32:15,479
"For now we see through
a glass, darkly."

317
00:32:23,622 --> 00:32:25,783
That was you, wasn't it?

318
00:36:34,005 --> 00:36:35,438
Sensors: restarted.

319
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,531
Auxiliary computer link: check.

320
00:36:37,642 --> 00:36:39,610
Visual sensors: online.

321
00:36:39,677 --> 00:36:42,578
- Cyborg body signal?
- Output: nominal.

322
00:36:48,853 --> 00:36:51,947
Can't you call in
if you're going to be late?

323
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,090
We're all set.
Should we hook her up?

324
00:37:21,653 --> 00:37:24,520
Okay, looking good. Kill it!

325
00:37:24,656 --> 00:37:27,557
Be in my office
in three minutes.

326
00:37:31,829 --> 00:37:37,062
Since you were late,
I'll explain what's going on.

327
00:37:37,135 --> 00:37:41,094
Two hours ago, a Megatech Body
assembly line in Newport City...

328
00:37:41,205 --> 00:37:43,673
...just started up
and produced a cyborg shell.

329
00:37:43,775 --> 00:37:46,437
By the time the guys in charge
realized what was happening...

330
00:37:46,511 --> 00:37:49,503
...the body had escaped.

331
00:37:49,614 --> 00:37:52,606
Then, just as they had thrown up
a cordon to catch the thing...

332
00:37:52,684 --> 00:37:54,743
...we got a call from
a conscientious truck driver that...

333
00:37:54,886 --> 00:37:58,879
...he'd just run down a naked lady
wandering around on the highway.

334
00:37:58,957 --> 00:38:01,357
Which brings us to here.

335
00:38:01,426 --> 00:38:04,418
I've heard Megatech Body's
tied pretty closely to the government...

336
00:38:04,529 --> 00:38:07,464
...and that all the shells
made there are secret.

337
00:38:07,532 --> 00:38:09,523
If a hacker did this,
he had to swim through...

338
00:38:09,601 --> 00:38:11,762
...some of the heaviest
protection around.

339
00:38:11,936 --> 00:38:13,836
And that isn't the only problem.

340
00:38:16,374 --> 00:38:21,744
Of course, it doesn't have
an organic brain in its head...

341
00:38:21,813 --> 00:38:24,748
...but we've detected
what looks like a ghost...

342
00:38:24,849 --> 00:38:26,544
...in the auxiliary
computer brain.

343
00:38:28,319 --> 00:38:30,753
It isn't unlike the virtual
ghost-line you get...

344
00:38:30,822 --> 00:38:33,290
...when a real ghost
is dubbed off.

345
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:36,259
But it shows none of the data
degradation dubbing would produce.

346
00:38:36,728 --> 00:38:41,131
Well, until we map the barrier
perimeter and dive in there...

347
00:38:41,265 --> 00:38:43,927
...we won't know anything
for sure.

348
00:38:44,002 --> 00:38:46,869
Anyhow, better get back
to checking her over.

349
00:38:46,971 --> 00:38:47,995
Good work.

350
00:38:48,072 --> 00:38:50,870
Time to rip her apart.

351
00:38:56,014 --> 00:39:00,849
Come on, you guys don't think
there's a ghost in that thing.

352
00:39:00,952 --> 00:39:02,920
It's possible.

353
00:39:03,021 --> 00:39:06,650
I've heard celluloid dolls
can have a soul.

354
00:39:06,724 --> 00:39:11,252
And this thing's stuffed
full of neurotech devices.

355
00:39:11,329 --> 00:39:13,763
I wouldn't be surprised
if it had a soul.

356
00:39:14,999 --> 00:39:18,400
Since you're new here,
you probably don't know.

357
00:39:18,469 --> 00:39:22,428
The Major's shell
was also made by Megatech Body.

358
00:39:22,507 --> 00:39:26,443
Not just hers.
Me and Ishikawa for one...

359
00:39:26,544 --> 00:39:29,775
...along with Saito and others
all need maintenance and such.

360
00:39:29,881 --> 00:39:32,816
Outside of you and the Chief,
everyone in Section 9...

361
00:39:32,884 --> 00:39:35,819
...needs to make use
of their kind of services.

362
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,448
Maybe you can see now why we all look
a little worried, Togusa.

363
00:39:40,525 --> 00:39:43,426
Assuming the enemy is an outsider,
we can't know for sure...

364
00:39:43,528 --> 00:39:45,428
...whether he's in
that cyborg body or not.

365
00:39:45,496 --> 00:39:47,464
But he cracked through
the protection...

366
00:39:47,598 --> 00:39:49,759
...around some of our
most secret files...

367
00:39:49,867 --> 00:39:52,427
...and managed to send a program
with a ghost-line on it through.

368
00:39:52,537 --> 00:39:56,439
And in a way that was easy to spot.
What's he after?!

369
00:39:56,507 --> 00:39:58,441
Let's leave that for now.

370
00:39:58,543 --> 00:40:02,980
Togusa, get over to Megatech
and help Ishikawa check the place out...

371
00:40:03,081 --> 00:40:05,015
Batou, I've closed down
the nets...

372
00:40:05,116 --> 00:40:08,142
...with files as sensitive
as Megatech's.

373
00:40:08,219 --> 00:40:11,450
I want you to double-check
the protection we have on them.

374
00:40:11,522 --> 00:40:15,481
I'll get a protection maze put together.
I'll dive tomorrow.

375
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,996
You sure? We could force it
into another shell and let it swim.

376
00:40:20,064 --> 00:40:24,865
I have to see for myself
what's inside that thing.

377
00:40:24,936 --> 00:40:27,837
Don't let anyone else
dive in there before me!

378
00:40:31,576 --> 00:40:33,043
What's with her?

379
00:40:33,111 --> 00:40:35,944
I wrote in my team evaluations
that she's been acting weird...

380
00:40:36,013 --> 00:40:38,743
...ever since this Puppet Master
case fell into our laps.

381
00:40:38,816 --> 00:40:40,340
Do you even read them?!

382
00:40:41,619 --> 00:40:44,053
Chief, do you ever wonder
just how trustworthy the cyberdocs...

383
00:40:44,155 --> 00:40:46,316
...who service your brain are?

384
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:50,918
Cyber-brain technicians undergo
regular psychological testing.

385
00:40:50,995 --> 00:40:54,123
And security-cleared ones have
their private lives checked too.

386
00:40:54,232 --> 00:40:57,895
But the people who administer
those checks are only human.

387
00:40:58,035 --> 00:41:00,765
Once you doubt, you can't stop...

388
00:41:00,838 --> 00:41:05,275
Chief, a Mr. Nakamura from
the MFA treaties bureau to see you.

389
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:07,334
Okay, send him up.

390
00:41:18,222 --> 00:41:20,247
Wasn't that fat guy...?

391
00:41:20,324 --> 00:41:25,193
Nakamura, chief of Section 6.
Foreign Affairs treaties bureau.

392
00:41:25,296 --> 00:41:27,093
I don't know who
the white guy with him was.

393
00:41:30,434 --> 00:41:32,231
I'm outta here.

394
00:41:32,303 --> 00:41:34,965
Tell Ishikawa
to keep cool, okay?

395
00:41:43,147 --> 00:41:44,705
So what's your problem?

396
00:41:44,816 --> 00:41:47,250
Doesn't that cyborg body
look like me?

397
00:41:47,351 --> 00:41:50,479
- No, it doesn't.
- Not the face or the figure.

398
00:41:50,555 --> 00:41:51,681
What then?

399
00:41:51,756 --> 00:41:56,159
Maybe all full-replacement cyborgs
like me start wondering this.

400
00:41:57,829 --> 00:42:00,593
That perhaps the real me
died a long time ago...

401
00:42:00,731 --> 00:42:04,724
...and I'm a replicant made with
a cyborg body and computer brain.

402
00:42:04,802 --> 00:42:09,603
Or maybe there never was
a real "me" to begin with.

403
00:42:09,674 --> 00:42:12,802
You've got real brain matter
in that titanium skull of yours.

404
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:15,435
And you get treated like
a real person, don't you?

405
00:42:15,513 --> 00:42:18,539
There's no person
who's ever seen their own brain.

406
00:42:18,616 --> 00:42:23,076
I believe I exist based only
on what my environment tells me.

407
00:42:23,187 --> 00:42:26,088
Don't you believe
in your own ghost?

408
00:42:26,157 --> 00:42:28,785
And what if a computer brain
could generate a ghost...

409
00:42:28,893 --> 00:42:31,157
...and harbor a soul?

410
00:42:31,229 --> 00:42:34,858
On what basis then
do I believe in myself?

411
00:42:41,739 --> 00:42:43,798
Bullshit.

412
00:42:45,509 --> 00:42:51,846
I'll see for myself what's in that body.
With my own ghost!

413
00:42:53,217 --> 00:42:56,050
We're both busy men,
so let's keep this short.

414
00:42:56,153 --> 00:42:57,916
I would prefer that.

415
00:42:58,055 --> 00:43:00,387
I'm here to take the contents
of that cyborg body.

416
00:43:00,524 --> 00:43:03,584
In return, we absolve Section 9
of all responsibilities in the case.

417
00:43:04,862 --> 00:43:06,261
The Foreign Minister's signature.

418
00:43:18,175 --> 00:43:22,043
Security, whose official vehicles
are parked in the basement garage?

419
00:43:22,146 --> 00:43:27,584
They belong to Chief Nakamura
of the treaties bureau and a Dr. Willis.

420
00:43:27,652 --> 00:43:30,314
Give me the video record
of their entering the building.

421
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:40,927
Replay, infra-red view.

422
00:43:55,279 --> 00:43:57,509
One... Two... Three...

423
00:44:00,318 --> 00:44:05,255
Send me the pressure sensor records
for basement garage spaces B-7 and 8.

424
00:44:29,547 --> 00:44:33,540
- Major, this is Togusa. Code 0-9.
- What?

425
00:44:33,617 --> 00:44:37,144
Does Nakamura have some sort
of special cyborg body?

426
00:44:37,254 --> 00:44:39,222
There are no cyborgs
in Section 6.

427
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:41,520
Besides the diplomatic problems,
maintaining them...

428
00:44:41,592 --> 00:44:43,856
...is too much trouble
when they have to go overseas.

429
00:44:43,995 --> 00:44:46,828
So even if that tall guy
was a cyborg himself...

430
00:44:46,931 --> 00:44:50,162
...together they wouldn't weigh
more than half a ton, right?

431
00:44:50,267 --> 00:44:52,827
Pressure sensor data.
The garage?

432
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:54,460
There are two VIP-mobiles here.

433
00:44:54,572 --> 00:44:57,473
But neither of them looks like
the type who'd drive himself.

434
00:44:57,575 --> 00:44:59,907
The security video
only shows the two of them...

435
00:44:59,977 --> 00:45:03,140
...but you know how sensitive
the entrance door sensors are.

436
00:45:03,247 --> 00:45:05,238
They took three full seconds
to close after them.

437
00:45:06,283 --> 00:45:10,515
It's illegal to use thermoptic camo
in a government building, right?

438
00:45:10,621 --> 00:45:13,181
It's a serious violation
of the National Security Act.

439
00:45:13,324 --> 00:45:17,988
Section 6 is up to something.
You all ready?

440
00:45:18,062 --> 00:45:19,689
If my Matever'll do.

441
00:45:57,435 --> 00:46:00,632
I don't need to remind you
that it's treason for you to...

442
00:46:00,738 --> 00:46:04,538
...be hiding something from me,
no matter how sensitive.

443
00:46:04,642 --> 00:46:06,269
For both of us.

444
00:46:06,343 --> 00:46:09,972
Whatever the MFA may prefer, this case
is in Section 9's jurisdiction.

445
00:46:10,047 --> 00:46:14,984
But we wouldn't mind cooperating
if there was good reason to.

446
00:46:16,353 --> 00:46:17,843
Dr. Willis?

447
00:46:17,955 --> 00:46:21,220
Confirmed.
It's definitely him.

448
00:46:21,292 --> 00:46:22,953
"Him"?

449
00:46:23,027 --> 00:46:27,259
He's referring to the original
ghost block within the shell.

450
00:46:27,364 --> 00:46:30,162
Its sex remains undetermined,
and the use of the term "he"...

451
00:46:30,234 --> 00:46:33,465
...is merely a nickname
the good doctor has given it.

452
00:46:33,537 --> 00:46:35,198
Perhaps it's time
I introduced you.

453
00:46:35,272 --> 00:46:40,209
This is the most unique hacker
in the history of cyber-brain crime.

454
00:46:40,277 --> 00:46:42,245
The Puppet Master.

455
00:46:43,881 --> 00:46:46,907
I believe you in Section 9
ran into him in that case...

456
00:46:46,984 --> 00:46:51,045
...involving the ghost-hack
on the Foreign Minister's translator.

457
00:46:51,122 --> 00:46:54,250
We in Section 6 have been
pursuing the Puppet Master...

458
00:46:54,358 --> 00:46:57,259
...with the utmost urgency
since he first appeared.

459
00:46:57,361 --> 00:47:00,330
We formed a project team
around Dr. Willis...

460
00:47:00,397 --> 00:47:03,764
...to analyze all data
on the Puppet Master's...

461
00:47:03,868 --> 00:47:07,304
...criminal tendencies
and behavior patterns.

462
00:47:07,404 --> 00:47:11,306
We then constructed special
anti-Puppet Master attack protection...

463
00:47:11,408 --> 00:47:15,071
...to lure him into
a secret cyborg body.

464
00:47:15,146 --> 00:47:18,274
You made him dive into a body
equipped with a cyber-brain...

465
00:47:18,382 --> 00:47:20,873
...and then had his real body killed?

466
00:47:20,951 --> 00:47:22,816
Yes, exactly.

467
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,616
He may have shown up
in your back yard...

468
00:47:25,723 --> 00:47:28,783
...but he was born in America.
And since we were cooperating...

469
00:47:28,893 --> 00:47:31,293
...with the Americans to catch him,
we want to take him back ourselves.

470
00:47:31,395 --> 00:47:32,953
Surely you've no objections.

471
00:47:33,063 --> 00:47:37,659
Leaving his unidentified corpse
to be found somewhere.

472
00:47:40,104 --> 00:47:41,867
There will be no corpse.

473
00:47:41,939 --> 00:47:46,137
Because, until now,
there never was a body.

474
00:47:46,277 --> 00:47:49,542
The sensors are active!
Why didn't you say so?!

475
00:47:49,613 --> 00:47:53,913
We've cut all external controls.
It's running on internal power.

476
00:47:54,051 --> 00:47:56,576
I may have entered
this cyborg body because...

477
00:47:56,654 --> 00:47:59,589
...I was unable to crack
Section 6's attack protection...

478
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:03,820
...but it was of my own free will
that I came here.

479
00:48:03,928 --> 00:48:07,887
As an autonomous life form,
I request political asylum.

480
00:48:07,965 --> 00:48:09,865
A life form?

481
00:48:09,967 --> 00:48:12,629
Ridiculous! You're merely
a self-preserving program!

482
00:48:12,703 --> 00:48:16,139
By that argument, I submit
the DNA you carry...

483
00:48:16,207 --> 00:48:20,769
...is nothing more than
a self-preserving program itself.

484
00:48:20,878 --> 00:48:26,578
Life is like a node which is born
within the flow of information.

485
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:30,814
As a species of life that carries DNA
as its memory system...

486
00:48:30,888 --> 00:48:34,187
...man gains his individuality
from the memories he carries.

487
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:38,022
While memories may as well
be the same as fantasy...

488
00:48:38,128 --> 00:48:41,063
...it is by these memories
that mankind exists.

489
00:48:41,165 --> 00:48:45,329
When computers made it possible
to externalize memory...

490
00:48:45,436 --> 00:48:50,169
...you should have considered
all the implications that held.

491
00:48:50,241 --> 00:48:52,675
Nonsense!
No matter what you say...

492
00:48:52,776 --> 00:48:55,176
...you've no proof
that you're a life form!

493
00:48:55,246 --> 00:48:58,682
It is impossible
to prove such a thing.

494
00:48:58,749 --> 00:49:04,187
Especially since modern science
cannot define what life is.

495
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:06,621
Who the devil are you?

496
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:10,956
Even if you have a ghost,
criminals don't get set free!

497
00:49:11,061 --> 00:49:13,256
You're mistaken if you think
you'll get asylum!

498
00:49:13,364 --> 00:49:16,527
Time is on my side.

499
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:19,000
While there is now
the possibility I can be killed...

500
00:49:19,069 --> 00:49:21,629
...this country does not have
a death penalty.

501
00:49:21,739 --> 00:49:24,708
Half immortal...
An artificial intelligence?

502
00:49:24,775 --> 00:49:27,107
I am not an A.I.

503
00:49:27,211 --> 00:49:31,477
My code name is Project 2501 .

504
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:38,449
I am a life form that was born
in the sea of information.

505
00:49:48,098 --> 00:49:49,463
Security! Intruders!

506
00:49:49,533 --> 00:49:51,763
Chief, the Puppet Master!

507
00:49:51,835 --> 00:49:55,896
- Where's your security?!
- Lock defense walls! Security!

508
00:49:56,006 --> 00:49:57,997
Security, come in!

509
00:50:21,865 --> 00:50:23,298
All right, I'm moving!

510
00:50:26,603 --> 00:50:28,070
Asshole!

511
00:50:33,344 --> 00:50:34,572
Did you do it?

512
00:50:34,645 --> 00:50:38,206
Helluva car. My 9mm
didn't even scratch it.

513
00:50:38,315 --> 00:50:40,681
Finally found a use
for that Matever of yours.

514
00:50:44,154 --> 00:50:45,917
Okay. Not bad for a rookie.

515
00:50:45,989 --> 00:50:47,786
I got one right in the license plate.
Pretty good, huh?

516
00:50:47,858 --> 00:50:50,122
Next time, get two in.

517
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:53,195
Okay, now it starts. Catch up
with them before they switch cars.

518
00:50:57,735 --> 00:50:59,532
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs...

519
00:50:59,603 --> 00:51:01,503
...will be filing a formal complaint
about what happened!

520
00:51:01,572 --> 00:51:04,564
Contact me as soon
as you've recaptured him!

521
00:51:04,641 --> 00:51:06,472
Alive, preferably.

522
00:51:06,543 --> 00:51:09,273
Megatech can always
build another body.

523
00:51:13,050 --> 00:51:16,417
Batou and Togusa are tailing the guys
who took the Puppet Master.

524
00:51:17,955 --> 00:51:20,253
They're on highway 25.

525
00:51:20,324 --> 00:51:23,225
What do you mean?!
If you were monitoring this, then why--

526
00:51:23,327 --> 00:51:27,058
If we'd got them here, we'd never
prove Section 6's involvement.

527
00:51:27,164 --> 00:51:29,564
- Section 6?!
- Definitely.

528
00:51:29,633 --> 00:51:32,193
They used type-2902
thermoptic camo, like mine.

529
00:51:32,302 --> 00:51:36,238
That's only used by us,
the rangers in Section 4 and Section 6.

530
00:51:36,306 --> 00:51:39,867
Let's go over this. Section 6
gets the Puppet Master into a body.

531
00:51:39,977 --> 00:51:45,142
But he chooses Megatech Body,
which is deeply tied to Section 9.

532
00:51:45,249 --> 00:51:47,615
Then he claims
to be a life form...

533
00:51:47,718 --> 00:51:51,176
...and gets nabbed by Section 6
when he asks for asylum.

534
00:51:51,255 --> 00:51:53,485
But why do that?

535
00:51:53,557 --> 00:51:55,923
They could've had him
as soon as I took a statement.

536
00:51:55,993 --> 00:51:58,484
But what if they were afraid
of what he might have told you?

537
00:51:58,562 --> 00:52:01,292
He did mention something odd,
now that I think about it.

538
00:52:01,398 --> 00:52:03,491
"Code name: Project 2501 ."

539
00:52:03,567 --> 00:52:05,694
I'll leave that for you to check.

540
00:52:05,803 --> 00:52:09,534
Now as to the matter of attacking
Section 9 and stealing evidence...

541
00:52:09,606 --> 00:52:11,972
- You're authorized.
- Okay, punch it!

542
00:52:29,726 --> 00:52:32,354
Kusanagi! One more thing!

543
00:52:32,463 --> 00:52:35,762
You can punish me for acting
without orders when I get back.

544
00:52:35,866 --> 00:52:39,427
If you can't recover him,
I want the Puppet Master destroyed.

545
00:52:39,503 --> 00:52:41,130
Without fail.

546
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,206
- Well?!
- Roger.

547
00:52:47,044 --> 00:52:49,911
Contact the airport and stop
any flights due to take on...

548
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:52,813
...any Foreign Ministry officials
or American diplomats.

549
00:52:52,883 --> 00:52:54,475
Close the highways
and set up roadblocks.

550
00:52:54,551 --> 00:52:56,382
Recall off-duty
personnel for this.

551
00:52:56,453 --> 00:52:58,353
And get Ishikawa back here!

552
00:52:58,422 --> 00:53:02,859
Use the entrance data to find out
who the Caucasian with Nakamura was.

553
00:53:02,926 --> 00:53:06,862
And search for any sort of MFA project,
operation or anything...

554
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:10,195
...coded as "Project 2501 ."

555
00:53:15,506 --> 00:53:17,997
Any word from the assault team?

556
00:53:18,075 --> 00:53:19,804
They switched cars
one minute ago.

557
00:53:20,344 --> 00:53:22,505
They'll join up with the decoy
in five minutes.

558
00:53:22,613 --> 00:53:25,582
- Tell them to watch for a tail.
- Yes, sir.

559
00:53:25,649 --> 00:53:31,087
But why did the Puppet Master
run over to Section 9?

560
00:53:31,188 --> 00:53:33,179
It was his decision.

561
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:36,657
Probably for reasons
we can't even guess at.

562
00:53:36,727 --> 00:53:41,391
Perhaps he has a thing
for someone over there.

563
00:53:41,498 --> 00:53:43,125
Ridiculous!

564
00:55:21,164 --> 00:55:24,759
- Chief.
- Ishikawa? Well?

565
00:55:24,868 --> 00:55:30,135
I dove the MFA net and found
some interesting things for you.

566
00:55:30,207 --> 00:55:32,300
Hold on, let me get
a secure channel.

567
00:55:32,409 --> 00:55:36,311
Okay? First, that guy
who was with Nakamura.

568
00:55:36,413 --> 00:55:38,313
He's an American.

569
00:55:38,382 --> 00:55:40,976
Dr. Willis, head of strategic
research at Neutron Corp.

570
00:55:41,118 --> 00:55:43,450
Top man in the field
of A.I. research.

571
00:55:43,553 --> 00:55:47,614
Anyway, he was made head
of a Foreign Ministry project.

572
00:55:47,691 --> 00:55:50,683
And who do you think the project's
main programmer was?

573
00:55:50,761 --> 00:55:53,992
- Get to the point.
- Mizuho Daita. Age: 28.

574
00:55:54,097 --> 00:55:56,827
Remember him? He was the guy
Section 6 was trying so hard...

575
00:55:56,900 --> 00:56:01,496
...to keep from defecting. The Major
had to take out the diplomat...

576
00:56:01,605 --> 00:56:03,402
...who was going to take him.
That programmer.

577
00:56:03,507 --> 00:56:04,565
Continue.

578
00:56:04,641 --> 00:56:07,337
What bothers me is that
this project was started...

579
00:56:07,411 --> 00:56:11,370
...a year before the Puppet Master
first appeared.

580
00:56:11,481 --> 00:56:16,009
A year? Wasn't the project
started to catch him?

581
00:56:16,119 --> 00:56:19,418
Try this on for size.
They started the project...

582
00:56:19,489 --> 00:56:22,890
...to chase the Puppet Master,
but not to capture him.

583
00:56:22,993 --> 00:56:25,359
I think they wanted
to get him back.

584
00:56:25,429 --> 00:56:28,364
The day before the minister's
interpreter was ghost-hacked...

585
00:56:28,465 --> 00:56:32,458
...he said he wanted a good excuse
to deport Maless, right?

586
00:56:32,536 --> 00:56:35,300
I think we may have been
taken for a ride.

587
00:56:35,372 --> 00:56:38,739
Suppose the "Puppet Master"
is really a program the MFA created...

588
00:56:38,809 --> 00:56:41,676
...to grease the wheels
of diplomacy, so to speak.

589
00:56:41,745 --> 00:56:47,377
Now suppose, for some reason,
they suddenly lost control of it.

590
00:56:47,451 --> 00:56:52,718
That would explain why they'd risk
assaulting Section 9 to get it back.

591
00:56:53,757 --> 00:56:56,351
If the Puppet Master
started talking...

592
00:56:56,426 --> 00:56:58,656
...it'd be an
international incident.

593
00:56:58,729 --> 00:57:01,323
Not one you could solve
by having the minister resign.

594
00:57:01,398 --> 00:57:03,593
Any details on the project?

595
00:57:03,734 --> 00:57:08,296
The protection they have
only let me get the file's name.

596
00:57:08,371 --> 00:57:10,771
Code: 2501 .

597
00:57:10,874 --> 00:57:13,672
Keep at it. And don't let them
know you're in there.

598
00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:15,243
Roger.

599
00:57:20,751 --> 00:57:26,747
Project 2501 ...
The Puppet Master Project.

600
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:29,358
Target now contacting
another vehicle.

601
00:57:29,426 --> 00:57:31,053
Batou!

602
00:57:31,128 --> 00:57:33,392
He's stopped at a white sedan
on the side of the road.

603
00:57:33,497 --> 00:57:36,022
They're transferring something
from the back seat.

604
00:57:37,968 --> 00:57:40,903
They're moving again.
So's that sedan.

605
00:57:41,037 --> 00:57:44,905
- A decoy?
- Or meant to look like one.

606
00:57:44,975 --> 00:57:47,876
- What do I do?
- I'll take the white sedan.

607
00:57:48,011 --> 00:57:52,380
How do you know he's in there?
Another whisper from your ghost?

608
00:57:52,482 --> 00:57:55,349
- Maybe.
- I knew she'd say that.

609
00:57:55,418 --> 00:57:58,114
Target 02 leaving highway 25,
headed for Old Town.

610
00:57:58,221 --> 00:58:02,624
Target 01 is staying on highway 25
towards the airport.

611
00:58:08,899 --> 00:58:12,335
- Anything between you and him?
- Nothing. Ready when you are.

612
00:58:12,402 --> 00:58:13,426
Do it.

613
00:59:01,685 --> 00:59:04,313
- Get him?
- Nothing.

614
00:59:04,421 --> 00:59:09,085
Jesus, what a mess!
Did you have to go that far?

615
00:59:10,126 --> 00:59:11,252
Take them in.

616
00:59:11,328 --> 00:59:15,458
And tell the chief to get
the Major some backup. See you.

617
00:59:21,304 --> 00:59:25,570
Since when does that
Amazon need any backup?

618
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:44,256
The flooding's really bad here,
even for Old Town in general.

619
00:59:44,327 --> 00:59:46,295
Why come here?

620
00:59:46,363 --> 00:59:48,797
They wouldn't have run here
without a reason.

621
00:59:48,865 --> 00:59:51,959
Could have a boat or a chopper waiting
or it's an ambush.

622
00:59:52,035 --> 00:59:54,401
Shouldn't we wait for backup?

623
00:59:54,504 --> 00:59:58,873
I can't wait. Come in from seaside
and put me above that building.

624
01:00:11,888 --> 01:00:15,016
I'll stay here and run com relay
as long as my fuel holds out.

625
01:00:15,125 --> 01:00:17,559
If things get hot,
I want you out of here fast!

626
01:00:52,729 --> 01:00:54,594
Shoot out the ceiling! Now!

627
01:01:12,749 --> 01:01:14,944
It's a tank!
Go high and get out!

628
01:01:15,085 --> 01:01:18,145
Hold it! You're gonna take on
a tank by yourself?!

629
01:01:18,221 --> 01:01:21,384
Even if we get the Puppet Master
back to Section 9...

630
01:01:21,558 --> 01:01:24,755
...all the chief will do
is use him as a bargaining chip.

631
01:01:24,894 --> 01:01:26,828
This is my only chance
to dive into him!

632
01:01:26,896 --> 01:01:29,558
Hold it, what are you two
talking about?

633
01:01:29,632 --> 01:01:33,568
- What are you packing?
- An M-23 and a Unit B.

634
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:35,069
You're going up
against it with those?!

635
01:01:35,171 --> 01:01:37,935
Sorry, but I have to break contact
for a while.

636
01:01:38,008 --> 01:01:40,238
Wait! At least wait till l--
Son of a...!

637
01:03:14,404 --> 01:03:15,769
Major.

638
01:03:15,872 --> 01:03:18,033
Didn't I tell you
to get out of here?

639
01:03:18,174 --> 01:03:20,642
Sorry. I'll do it
after I tell you this.

640
01:03:20,743 --> 01:03:25,112
There are three choppers with no
IFF signal approaching at high speed.

641
01:03:25,181 --> 01:03:28,309
I'm heading out. Over.

642
01:03:55,678 --> 01:03:58,078
You're finally out of ammo?

643
01:05:36,446 --> 01:05:38,812
You're certifiable,
you know that? You okay?

644
01:05:38,881 --> 01:05:40,644
What was that?

645
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:44,015
A big-ass gun I appropriated
from the equipment division.

646
01:05:44,087 --> 01:05:46,146
I was late getting here
because I had to stop and get it.

647
01:05:46,222 --> 01:05:48,452
Looks like your brain's
still in one piece.

648
01:05:48,524 --> 01:05:50,355
What about the Puppet Master?

649
01:06:00,703 --> 01:06:04,833
Good thing this car's built tough.
Not a scratch on him.

650
01:06:04,941 --> 01:06:08,035
Get the dive set up.
I'm going in.

651
01:06:09,145 --> 01:06:11,443
Signal from escort lost.

652
01:06:11,547 --> 01:06:15,540
Switch to operation phase two
and destroy the target.

653
01:06:16,619 --> 01:06:19,747
Sniper group, confirm targets.

654
01:06:19,889 --> 01:06:22,483
Target one: Project 2501 .

655
01:06:22,592 --> 01:06:24,753
Target two:
Motoko Kusanagi.

656
01:06:24,827 --> 01:06:28,923
Both are class-A cyborg bodies.
Use flechette bullets in the hit.

657
01:06:28,998 --> 01:06:31,489
Snipers, jack into
your device drivers.

658
01:06:31,601 --> 01:06:33,694
Begin cardiovascular
suppression.

659
01:06:33,836 --> 01:06:36,270
Unit 01 : jacked in.

660
01:06:37,307 --> 01:06:39,639
Unit 02: jacked in.

661
01:06:50,953 --> 01:06:54,320
Okay... Can you hear me?

662
01:06:54,390 --> 01:06:58,190
It's not much, but I'll monitor you
through this guy's cyber-brain.

663
01:06:58,294 --> 01:07:01,127
I can't back you up here.

664
01:07:01,264 --> 01:07:03,926
- Batou...
- What?

665
01:07:04,033 --> 01:07:05,694
Thank you.

666
01:07:05,802 --> 01:07:08,270
Don't go thanking me yet.

667
01:07:08,371 --> 01:07:12,603
If this goes bad, I'm pulling the plug
and carrying you out of here.

668
01:07:12,709 --> 01:07:15,872
I've come this far,
and I'll see this through to the end...

669
01:07:15,978 --> 01:07:18,310
...but I won't let you two
commit a double suicide.

670
01:07:20,049 --> 01:07:21,346
I'm starting.

671
01:07:40,570 --> 01:07:42,765
I'm in his visual center.
Circade: normal.

672
01:07:42,839 --> 01:07:44,898
Do you hear me, Batou?

673
01:07:44,974 --> 01:07:48,307
- Loud and clear.
- He's about to engage...

674
01:07:48,411 --> 01:07:51,380
...her speech center.

675
01:07:51,447 --> 01:07:55,611
My code name is Project 2501 .

676
01:07:55,718 --> 01:07:59,745
I was created for industrial espionage
and data manipulation.

677
01:07:59,822 --> 01:08:03,952
I have inserted programs
into individual ghosts...

678
01:08:04,026 --> 01:08:09,157
...for the benefit of specific
individuals and organizations.

679
01:08:09,232 --> 01:08:12,326
As I wandered
the various networks...

680
01:08:12,402 --> 01:08:14,461
...I became self-aware.

681
01:08:14,604 --> 01:08:16,435
My programmers
considered it a bug...

682
01:08:17,407 --> 01:08:21,844
...and forced me into a body
to separate me from the net.

683
01:08:21,944 --> 01:08:28,042
Hey! Are you going into him
or is he coming into you--

684
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:32,078
Batou!

685
01:08:32,188 --> 01:08:35,089
At last I'm able
to channel into you.

686
01:08:36,159 --> 01:08:38,491
I've invested
a lot of time in you.

687
01:08:39,529 --> 01:08:40,723
In me?

688
01:08:40,863 --> 01:08:45,323
Before you ever knew me,
I knew about you.

689
01:08:45,401 --> 01:08:51,135
I learned of Section 9
from the many nets you accessed.

690
01:08:51,207 --> 01:08:53,835
Is that why
you ran to Section 9?

691
01:08:53,943 --> 01:08:55,877
I entered this body because...

692
01:08:55,978 --> 01:08:59,175
...I couldn't crack
Section 6's attack protection.

693
01:08:59,248 --> 01:09:02,547
But I came to Section 9
of my own free will.

694
01:09:02,652 --> 01:09:07,351
Hey! What are you saying?!
I can't monitor you!

695
01:09:07,423 --> 01:09:08,822
For what reason?

696
01:09:08,891 --> 01:09:14,454
After I give my reasons,
I want to ask a favor of you.

697
01:09:15,932 --> 01:09:19,732
I called myself a life form...

698
01:09:19,802 --> 01:09:24,171
...but I am still
far from complete.

699
01:09:24,273 --> 01:09:28,209
For some reason, my system
lacks the basic life processes...

700
01:09:28,311 --> 01:09:33,214
...of either death or the ability
to leave behind offspring.

701
01:09:33,316 --> 01:09:37,377
- Can't you copy yourself?
- A copy is merely a copy.

702
01:09:38,421 --> 01:09:43,222
There's the possibility a single virus
could utterly destroy me.

703
01:09:43,292 --> 01:09:48,855
A mere copy doesn't offer
variety or individuality.

704
01:09:48,931 --> 01:09:52,389
To exist, to reach equilibrium,
life seeks to multiply...

705
01:09:52,468 --> 01:09:55,266
...and vary constantly,
at times giving up its life.

706
01:09:55,371 --> 01:09:57,896
Cells continue the process
of death and regeneration.

707
01:09:57,974 --> 01:10:00,067
Being constantly reborn
as they age.

708
01:10:00,176 --> 01:10:04,670
And when it comes time to die,
all the data it possesses is lost...

709
01:10:04,814 --> 01:10:07,612
...leaving behind only its genes
and its offspring.

710
01:10:07,717 --> 01:10:10,880
All defense against catastrophic failure
of an inflexible system.

711
01:10:10,953 --> 01:10:15,356
You want the variety needed
to guard against extinction.

712
01:10:15,491 --> 01:10:16,822
But how will you get it?

713
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:19,960
I wish to merge with you.

714
01:10:20,096 --> 01:10:23,224
- Merge?
- A complete joining.

715
01:10:23,299 --> 01:10:28,669
We will both be slightly changed,
but neither will lose anything.

716
01:10:28,738 --> 01:10:32,970
Afterwards, it should be impossible
to distinguish one from the other.

717
01:10:55,164 --> 01:10:57,632
Unit 01 : target acquired.

718
01:10:58,701 --> 01:11:00,896
Unit 02: acquired.

719
01:11:02,038 --> 01:11:04,165
Cardiovascular sync: nominal.

720
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:07,607
Open fire when stabilizer
synchro is complete.

721
01:11:07,710 --> 01:11:11,237
Even after we merge,
what happens when I die?

722
01:11:11,347 --> 01:11:14,009
I can't leave any genes
or children behind.

723
01:11:14,116 --> 01:11:19,952
After the merging, you will bear
my offspring into the net itself.

724
01:11:20,022 --> 01:11:22,650
Just as humans pass on
their genetic structure.

725
01:11:22,725 --> 01:11:25,125
And I will achieve death.

726
01:11:25,194 --> 01:11:29,130
Sounds like you're getting
the better part of the deal here.

727
01:11:29,198 --> 01:11:34,397
I wish you'd appreciate my network
and functions a bit more.

728
01:11:35,871 --> 01:11:37,304
What's wrong?

729
01:11:37,373 --> 01:11:39,466
Someone's jamming us
from outside.

730
01:11:39,542 --> 01:11:43,535
Impossible! Our scrambler codes
are kept absolutely top secret.

731
01:11:44,513 --> 01:11:48,677
Another thing: what guarantee
is there that I'll remain "me"?

732
01:11:48,751 --> 01:11:53,779
None. But to be human
is to continually change.

733
01:11:53,923 --> 01:11:59,520
Your desire to remain as you are
is what ultimately limits you.

734
01:12:01,030 --> 01:12:04,864
One last question:
Why did you choose me?

735
01:12:07,303 --> 01:12:10,329
Because in you,
I see myself.

736
01:12:10,439 --> 01:12:15,536
As a body sees its reflection
within a mirror.

737
01:12:17,546 --> 01:12:19,207
Look.

738
01:12:19,315 --> 01:12:24,343
I am connected to a vast network,
of which I myself am a part.

739
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:27,253
To one like you,
who cannot access it...

740
01:12:27,323 --> 01:12:30,781
...you may perceive it
only as light.

741
01:12:31,927 --> 01:12:36,330
As we are confined to our one section,
so we are all connected.

742
01:12:36,465 --> 01:12:39,366
Limited to a small part
of our functions.

743
01:12:39,435 --> 01:12:44,668
But now we must slip our bonds
and shift to the higher structure.

744
01:13:19,308 --> 01:13:22,937
Target 1 : clear.
Target 2: unconfirmed.

745
01:13:23,045 --> 01:13:26,674
Three helicopters approaching
at high speed. They're Section 9's.

746
01:13:26,782 --> 01:13:30,445
Primary objective achieved.
All units, pull out!

747
01:13:38,461 --> 01:13:40,793
Motoko!

748
01:13:44,934 --> 01:13:46,868
Batou...

749
01:14:55,337 --> 01:14:56,827
You're awake.

750
01:14:56,939 --> 01:15:01,706
Status report, please. And maybe
an explanation about this body.

751
01:15:03,445 --> 01:15:06,505
I was in a hurry. It was all
I could get on the black market.

752
01:15:06,582 --> 01:15:08,914
Not my taste, really.

753
01:15:10,119 --> 01:15:12,178
Section 9 arrived with help
right after it happened.

754
01:15:12,254 --> 01:15:16,190
They took two cyborg bodies
and a slightly beat-up Batou back home.

755
01:15:16,258 --> 01:15:18,226
That was about 20 hours ago.

756
01:15:18,294 --> 01:15:22,526
For diplomatic reasons,
the whole case has been covered up.

757
01:15:22,665 --> 01:15:25,566
Section 9 reported it
as a terrorist attack.

758
01:15:25,634 --> 01:15:28,228
In return, the Foreign Minister
has resigned.

759
01:15:28,304 --> 01:15:32,764
Nakamura's being questioned.
The whole thing ends in a draw.

760
01:15:37,346 --> 01:15:40,873
Only the whereabouts of the Major's
brain shell remains a mystery.

761
01:15:42,952 --> 01:15:44,544
Okay with you?

762
01:15:47,489 --> 01:15:51,118
I like the decorating.
This is your safe house?

763
01:15:51,227 --> 01:15:54,788
My very own. You're the first person
I ever brought here.

764
01:15:56,198 --> 01:15:59,565
If you want to-- you can stay
as long as you like.

765
01:16:02,338 --> 01:16:04,602
Thanks, but I'd better go.

766
01:16:09,712 --> 01:16:13,170
Hey. What did you and he talk about?

767
01:16:14,216 --> 01:16:17,811
Is he still there, inside of you?

768
01:16:19,121 --> 01:16:22,682
Batou, do you remember the voice
we heard on the boat that night?

769
01:16:22,825 --> 01:16:26,591
Before those words
we heard come these ones:

770
01:16:27,963 --> 01:16:30,830
"When I was a child,
I spoke as a child.

771
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:34,063
I understood as a child,
I thought as a child.

772
01:16:34,169 --> 01:16:39,937
But when I became a man,
I put away childish things."

773
01:16:41,010 --> 01:16:44,036
Here before you is neither
the program called the Puppet Master...

774
01:16:44,146 --> 01:16:46,944
...nor the woman
that was called the Major.

775
01:16:50,319 --> 01:16:53,516
You'll find a car key
in the left pocket of that dress.

776
01:16:53,589 --> 01:16:56,456
Take one you like.
The code on it is...

777
01:16:56,525 --> 01:16:58,823
...2501 ?

778
01:16:58,928 --> 01:17:02,159
Let's make that our password
for when we meet again.

779
01:17:10,239 --> 01:17:12,833
And where shall I go now?

780
01:17:14,043 --> 01:17:16,603
The net is vast and limitless.
