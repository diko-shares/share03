00:00:47.631 --> 00:00:49.882
<i>We all wanna be the perfect family.</i>

2
00:00:50.384 --> 00:00:52.093
<i>But who's perfect, right?</i>

3
00:00:52.594 --> 00:00:57.890
<i>Every family has its challenges,
from picture day to picky eaters.</i>

4
00:00:58.392 --> 00:01:00.935
<i>For my family, our greatest challenge...</i>

5
00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:04.397
<i>probably the machine apocalypse.</i>

6
00:01:07.442 --> 00:01:09.777
The last humans must be here somewhere.

7
00:01:11.363 --> 00:01:12.363
Wait.

8
00:01:13.407 --> 00:01:14.448
They're coming.

9
00:01:19.037 --> 00:01:22.999
Is that a burnt orange
1993 station wagon? Or is it...?

10
00:01:25.877 --> 00:01:27.837
Who are these unstoppable warriors?

11
00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:29.505
- Hot! Hot!
- I told you to get a lid!

12
00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.091
- The dog is biting my hair!
- Look out!

13
00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:35.428
<i>There we are. Warriors.</i>

14
00:01:36.054 --> 00:01:38.055
<i>Most action heroes
have a lot of strengths.</i>

15
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.682
- Dad, look out!
- Katie, use a weapon!

16
00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:42.310
<i>My family only has weaknesses.</i>

17
00:01:51.612 --> 00:01:55.573
<i>My dad kind of reminds me of that YouTube
video of the screaming gibbon monkey.</i>

18
00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:09.462
<i>Look out, robots, because we're brave.</i>

19
00:02:10.005 --> 00:02:14.467
<i>We are hungry for action,
and we're strapped in for success.</i>

20
00:02:15.636 --> 00:02:17.553
<i>And we have no...</i>

21
00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:21.515
<i>idea what we're doing.</i>

22
00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:46.874
<i>I've always felt a little different
than everyone else.</i>

23
00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:50.628
<i>So I did what any outsider would do.
Made weird art.</i>

24
00:02:50.712 --> 00:02:53.255
Behold, cinema!

25
00:02:56.551 --> 00:02:57.760
<i>Hello, Katie.</i>

26
00:02:59.137 --> 00:03:01.514
<i>I'm alive now.
Even though I'm a hamburger,</i>

27
00:03:01.598 --> 00:03:04.308
<i>I wanna go to the big city
and be a Broadway star.</i>

28
00:03:04.393 --> 00:03:06.811
<i>Razzle dazzle, I'm a talking...</i>

29
00:03:07.646 --> 00:03:09.855
<i>Oh, gosh! Why? Oh, my innards!</i>

30
00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:21.492
<i>I never fit in.</i>

31
00:03:22.327 --> 00:03:24.412
<i>For lots of reasons.</i>

32
00:03:26.415 --> 00:03:28.582
<i>But movies were always there for me.</i>

33
00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:33.504
All right, Aaron, you're 58 years old,
you're a hardened criminal,

34
00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:35.881
and you got nothing to lose. Go.

35
00:03:36.717 --> 00:03:38.676
Oh, no! It's Dog Cop.

36
00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:42.722
I'm here to bust criminals
and lick my own butt.

37
00:03:44.307 --> 00:03:46.267
And I'm all out of criminals.

38
00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:49.437
<i>My parents haven't figured me out yet.</i>

39
00:03:49.521 --> 00:03:52.732
<i>To be fair, it took me a while
to figure myself out.</i>

40
00:03:57.821 --> 00:04:00.030
<i>My little brother, Aaron, gets me.</i>

41
00:04:00.115 --> 00:04:02.241
<i>But he's got his own weird interests.</i>

42
00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:04.618
Hi' would you like
to talk to me about dinosaurs?

43
00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:06.245
No. Okay, thank you.

44
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.626
Hi' would you like to talk to me
about dinosaurs?

45
00:04:12.711 --> 00:04:14.879
<i>My mom says she believes in me.</i>

46
00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:16.213
You can do this, hon.

47
00:04:16.298 --> 00:04:18.257
<i>But she says that to everyone.</i>

48
00:04:18.884 --> 00:04:20.676
You can look straight.

49
00:04:20.761 --> 00:04:23.304
Follow this pen. Follow this pen.

50
00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:26.974
You get an A for effort, Buster Brown.

51
00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:31.562
<i>My dad is an... unusual man.</i>

52
00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:35.566
<i>But he loves nature and can fix anything.</i>

53
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.737
To survive in the outdoors'
you'll need to know how to trap wild game.

54
00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:41.864
This is very sensitive...

55
00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:43.949
Hey, Mitchells. Hailey cooked you up...

56
00:04:45.994 --> 00:04:47.661
Hey, who's this curious guy?

57
00:04:49.873 --> 00:04:52.208
<i>He never shared my interests.</i>

58
00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:56.504
You wanna see these special effects
I made for Dog Cop 5?

59
00:04:56.588 --> 00:04:58.881
Sorry, Katie, I'm a little ocupado.

60
00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:01.926
Wanna check out this mallard? It's dead.

61
00:05:03.094 --> 00:05:04.094
It's okay.

62
00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.224
<i>It didn't really bother me, though.</i>

63
00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:12.061
<i>Besides, I had bigger plans.</i>

64
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.193
<i>I poured everything I had
into getting into film school in L.A.</i>

65
00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:25.533
<i>So after watching the epic Dog Cop saga
and 84 of my finest short films,</i>

66
00:05:25.617 --> 00:05:28.953
<i>I'm sure the California College of Film
would love to accept</i>

67
00:05:29.037 --> 00:05:32.039
<i>Katie Mitchell to film school!</i>

68
00:05:43.927 --> 00:05:44.760
Yes!

69
00:05:44.845 --> 00:05:48.138
<i>And the other accepted students
totally get me.</i>

70
00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:52.142
You guys like Roboslayers 4?
No one around here has even heard of that.

71
00:05:52.227 --> 00:05:53.644
<i>Why not? It's amazing.</i>

72
00:05:53.728 --> 00:05:56.564
<i>By the way, I saw some
of your videos online. They're hilarious.</i>

73
00:05:56.648 --> 00:05:58.357
<i>- So good.
- Mind-blowing.</i>

74
00:05:58.984 --> 00:06:02.653
<i>After all these years,
I'm finally gonna meet my people.</i>

75
00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:10.369
- Kids, dinner!
- Coming!

76
00:06:21.256 --> 00:06:22.298
Stop.

77
00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:24.133
Someone's in a good mood.

78
00:06:24.217 --> 00:06:27.136
Hey, to celebrate your last night...
Katie-face cupcakes.

79
00:06:29.264 --> 00:06:32.349
Any time I miss you,
I'm gonna bake you and eat you.

80
00:06:32.434 --> 00:06:35.269
Here, catch a cupcake, Monch.
Catch a cupcake.

81
00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:41.233
You'll get it, buddy.

82
00:06:41.318 --> 00:06:43.652
Oh, man, I'm gonna miss
that little dude when I leave.

83
00:06:43.737 --> 00:06:46.530
Speaking of which,
PAL, check me into my flight tomorrow.

84
00:06:46.615 --> 00:06:47.781
<i>Check-in at 9 a. m.</i>

85
00:06:47.866 --> 00:06:51.118
Katie, you know how velociraptors
usually hunt in pairs?

86
00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:57.124
Well, what happens
when one leaves the pack and...?

87
00:06:58.126 --> 00:07:01.337
Oh, dude, don't worry.
You'll make new friends.

88
00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:05.424
Maybe you could meet another smart,
charming, dinosaur-loving nerd.

89
00:07:06.718 --> 00:07:07.718
Or lady nerd.

90
00:07:07.802 --> 00:07:11.764
What? No!
Who would want that? That's crazy.

91
00:07:11.848 --> 00:07:12.848
I can't breathe.

92
00:07:15.393 --> 00:07:18.020
Do you really think
I'll be okay without you?

93
00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:20.814
I know you will. Raptor bash.

94
00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:25.194
Hey, I made something for you guys.

95
00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:27.571
Oh, hon, that looks so cute.

96
00:07:28.323 --> 00:07:29.448
Skip, skip.

97
00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:31.575
You got schmutz all over the screen.

98
00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.912
<i>Howdy, y'all. I'm Mark Bowman,
founder and CEO of Pal Labs.</i>

99
00:07:34.996 --> 00:07:36.288
New Pal announcement.

100
00:07:36.373 --> 00:07:38.207
You better update
the editing software, man.

101
00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:40.084
<i>We here at Pal like to do the impossible.</i>

102
00:07:40.168 --> 00:07:43.504
<i>From the Pal personal assistant,
to smart appliances,</i>

103
00:07:43.588 --> 00:07:45.589
<i>to even teaching dogs how to talk.</i>

104
00:07:45.674 --> 00:07:48.884
<i>Hello. I am dog.</i>

105
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.180
<i>But we are about to drop
our biggest invention yet.</i>

106
00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:56.558
<i>Your cellphone is about
to take its first steps.</i>

107
00:07:57.143 --> 00:07:59.144
- Is this real, or...?
- Yeah, hold on.

108
00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:00.562
Hey, gang.

109
00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:02.606
- Hi, hon.
- Hi, Dad.

110
00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:05.693
After a long day at work,
nice to see your faces...

111
00:08:07.946 --> 00:08:11.240
bathed in ghoulish blue light. Wonderful.

112
00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:13.117
Okay, you know what? Brilliant idea.

113
00:08:13.201 --> 00:08:17.287
This is our last night together
before Katie leaves, so let's savor this.

114
00:08:17.372 --> 00:08:19.331
How about we put our phones down,

115
00:08:19.416 --> 00:08:24.753
and we can make ten seconds
of unobstructed family eye contact.

116
00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:25.838
Starting right...

117
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.924
- This seems...
- Put your phone down. Now.

118
00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:38.434
See' this is good, right here.
This is natural.

119
00:08:39.477 --> 00:08:42.312
No, you're allowed to blink.
It's just eye contact.

120
00:08:42.397 --> 00:08:45.024
Look at Monch right there.
That's the spirit right there, huh?

121
00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:47.443
Katie, it seems like
you're not taking this seriously.

122
00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:49.653
What makes you say that?

123
00:08:49.738 --> 00:08:51.989
Guys, guys. Everyone, focus.
Keep focusing!

124
00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:55.242
Now that we're all comfortable,
I can't wait for you to see my new movie.

125
00:08:55.326 --> 00:08:58.662
I think it might be a masterpiece?

126
00:09:13.845 --> 00:09:15.679
What? What's the face?

127
00:09:16.514 --> 00:09:18.932
Well, I just wonder,

128
00:09:19.017 --> 00:09:23.687
do you really think you can
make a living with this stuff?

129
00:09:23.772 --> 00:09:25.439
Can you finish watching it at least?

130
00:09:25.523 --> 00:09:29.359
I will, but I just worry that you're gonna
be all the way in California,

131
00:09:29.444 --> 00:09:35.032
and we're not gonna be able to help you,
you know' if things don't... pan out.

132
00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:37.284
Lin, why are you kicking me?
I don't understand.

133
00:09:37.368 --> 00:09:40.704
Are you...?
Do you just think I'm gonna fail?

134
00:09:41.331 --> 00:09:43.457
I never... Lin, help?

135
00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:46.001
Looks like the cookies are ready.

136
00:09:46.085 --> 00:09:48.629
Who wants delicious cookies
instead of talking about this?

137
00:09:48.713 --> 00:09:50.130
No, it's just...

138
00:09:50.215 --> 00:09:52.841
Failure hurts, kid.
I want you to have a backup plan.

139
00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:54.968
Why do you always have to do this?

140
00:09:55.053 --> 00:09:57.012
Okay, you know what? I'm just gonna...

141
00:09:57.096 --> 00:09:59.014
- No, look, I'll watch it.
- Dad, it's too late.

142
00:09:59.098 --> 00:10:02.851
I wanna watch it. You're not letting me.
Why are you making a big deal of this?

143
00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:03.936
Dad, let go!

144
00:10:15.114 --> 00:10:17.533
If you think about it,
the people who made the computers

145
00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:18.700
are the ones to blame.

146
00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:22.663
That's how they make money, you know?
You gotta keep buying more and they...

147
00:10:22.747 --> 00:10:23.956
Katie, come on.

148
00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:28.335
Dad, this is exactly why
I'm excited to leave tomorrow.

149
00:10:50.942 --> 00:10:52.734
Why is he like this?

150
00:10:56.823 --> 00:10:58.407
Why is she like this?

151
00:11:00.743 --> 00:11:02.202
Did you talk to her yet?

152
00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:06.081
No. Not yet.

153
00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:08.125
I don't know what happened, Lin.

154
00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:12.004
I know teenagers are supposed to rebel
against their parents or something, but...

155
00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:15.007
I don't know,
I just thought that we'd be different.

156
00:11:16.342 --> 00:11:20.679
Rick, don't you think
you might have some control over that?

157
00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.599
You just broke her laptop. I mean...

158
00:11:23.683 --> 00:11:26.143
Look, we haven't had
a good family picture in years

159
00:11:26.227 --> 00:11:27.853
because you two are always arguing.

160
00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:30.898
Well, what about that one?

161
00:11:30.982 --> 00:11:32.691
That came with the frame.

162
00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:36.570
Whenever we have a problem at home,

163
00:11:36.654 --> 00:11:39.865
you always throw
your whole self into fixing it.

164
00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:41.825
And I love that about you.

165
00:11:42.327 --> 00:11:46.288
But now this is broken. Okay?

166
00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:50.667
Because if that girl leaves
and never comes home again,

167
00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:55.088
that's a problem I don't think we can fix.

168
00:12:01.846 --> 00:12:03.597
I know you can do this.

169
00:12:59.362 --> 00:13:02.614
And now, the Mitchell family talent show.

170
00:13:16.546 --> 00:13:19.715
<i>Bye, Katie. Are you excited for camp?</i>

171
00:13:20.591 --> 00:13:21.591
<i>Bye.</i>

172
00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.137
<i>Hey, what's wrong?</i>

173
00:13:25.221 --> 00:13:27.014
<i>You'll be back before you know it.</i>

174
00:13:28.891 --> 00:13:30.392
<i>Don't make me go.</i>

175
00:13:32.228 --> 00:13:33.478
<i>Well, look, let me just...</i>

176
00:13:37.025 --> 00:13:38.316
<i>Hey, take this.</i>

177
00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:42.320
<i>But this is, like, your favorite thing.</i>

178
00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:44.114
<i>Well, it's yours now.</i>

179
00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:47.325
<i>You see, this little guy
is scared to be alone,</i>

180
00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:49.536
<i>so you're gonna have
to cheer him up for me, okay?</i>

181
00:13:50.621 --> 00:13:53.665
<i>You know how to say, "I love you,"
in moose language? Let me just...</i>

182
00:13:56.169 --> 00:13:59.504
<i>Don't laugh. You're supposed
to be sad. Hey, come on...</i>

183
00:14:16.314 --> 00:14:18.398
All right. Let's fix it.

184
00:14:23.446 --> 00:14:24.446
Yes!

185
00:14:41.798 --> 00:14:42.964
Bring it in' buddy.

186
00:14:46.511 --> 00:14:47.594
Bye, Monch!

187
00:14:51.307 --> 00:14:54.476
Wait, why do you need all that
to take me to the airport?

188
00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:58.146
I messed things up last night,
but I'm gonna make it up to you.

189
00:14:59.607 --> 00:15:02.317
I canceled your plane ticket to college!

190
00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:03.735
You what?

191
00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.529
Don't freak out. I know you're excited.

192
00:15:05.613 --> 00:15:09.658
We'll drive you to school
on a cross-country road trip as a family.

193
00:15:09.742 --> 00:15:12.452
Why not pull up to school
in Ol' Iron Eagle here.

194
00:15:12.537 --> 00:15:17.415
It's got character, class, and some green
ooze we can learn about together.

195
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:23.130
And it comes with one coupon
for a father-daughter stick-shift lesson.

196
00:15:23.214 --> 00:15:24.339
Right?

197
00:15:24.423 --> 00:15:26.299
- Yeah!
- Mom?

198
00:15:26.384 --> 00:15:30.137
Your father kind of went rogue
on this one a little bit.

199
00:15:30.221 --> 00:15:32.764
But we do love his initiative, right?

200
00:15:33.516 --> 00:15:34.808
Aaron, you too?

201
00:15:34.892 --> 00:15:38.728
Well, I thought it could be cool
to hang out one last time.

202
00:15:38.813 --> 00:15:40.021
I don't know.

203
00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:45.527
We called the school. You can miss
orientation week, no problem.

204
00:15:45.611 --> 00:15:49.156
But it is a problem.
I've got all these friends to meet.

205
00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:52.617
There's this really cool girl Jade,
and we just like all the same stuff,

206
00:15:52.702 --> 00:15:55.287
and it's like everyone
at the school just gets me.

207
00:15:55.371 --> 00:15:57.956
There's a mixer, Dad. A mixer!

208
00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.458
What about hanging out
with your family? Alone.

209
00:16:00.543 --> 00:16:02.127
For hours in a car.

210
00:16:02.211 --> 00:16:03.295
You and me!

211
00:16:30.406 --> 00:16:32.407
Smell that open-road air.

212
00:16:34.035 --> 00:16:36.036
See? This isn't so bad. Huh?

213
00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:39.623
You know,
the Poseys are on vacation right now

214
00:16:39.707 --> 00:16:42.209
and look how happy they are.

215
00:16:42.293 --> 00:16:43.835
<i>Family yoga break.</i>

216
00:16:45.004 --> 00:16:47.380
Why are you so obsessed with them?
They're our neighbors.

217
00:16:47.465 --> 00:16:49.341
They're just so perfect.

218
00:16:49.425 --> 00:16:52.219
Even their dog
is in better shape than ours.

219
00:16:53.596 --> 00:16:56.389
What are they feeding that thing?
Other dogs?

220
00:16:56.474 --> 00:17:00.352
Lin, don't worry about them.
They're jealous of us. Right, Katie?

221
00:17:00.436 --> 00:17:02.229
I see you moping back there.

222
00:17:02.313 --> 00:17:05.398
But what at your college
could possibly be better than this?

223
00:17:05.483 --> 00:17:08.360
<i>We set up a Slip N' Slide in the dorms.
It's amazing.</i>

224
00:17:08.444 --> 00:17:12.322
<i>This is the best day of my life!
I'm making lifelong bonds!</i>

225
00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:16.117
<i>- College! College!
- I'm missing everything.</i>

226
00:17:16.786 --> 00:17:19.204
Oh, come on, hon. Your father is trying.

227
00:17:19.288 --> 00:17:21.498
Let's meet him halfway here' huh?
What do you say?

228
00:17:21.582 --> 00:17:23.792
That's the law! Mom Law.

229
00:17:23.876 --> 00:17:25.585
'Cause I'm the sheriff.

230
00:17:26.212 --> 00:17:27.504
All right, I'll try.

231
00:17:33.344 --> 00:17:36.680
Dad, this place
has literally zero stars on Yelp.

232
00:17:36.764 --> 00:17:39.641
It says "Do not eat here ever."

233
00:17:39.725 --> 00:17:41.268
Will we let an app tell us how to...?

234
00:17:45.106 --> 00:17:48.275
This is totally unrelated.
This is totally...

235
00:17:49.485 --> 00:17:52.279
Stupid traffic.
You know what this calls for?

236
00:17:52.989 --> 00:17:55.782
- Please don't say "The Rick..."
- The Rick Mitchell Special' baby!

237
00:17:57.076 --> 00:17:59.911
- This is illegal!
- It's not illegal if you're good at it.

238
00:18:01.872 --> 00:18:04.499
If you think about it,
I was helping the flow of traffic.

239
00:18:04.583 --> 00:18:05.750
What are you writing down?

240
00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:09.462
Wow, I gotta admit.
This is actually amazing.

241
00:18:09.547 --> 00:18:13.967
What's even more amazing,
I signed us up for a seven-hour mule tour.

242
00:18:14.051 --> 00:18:16.344
Dad, doesn't that sound
steep and dangerous?

243
00:18:16.429 --> 00:18:17.554
What could go wro...?

244
00:18:17.638 --> 00:18:21.016
- Get to the bridge if you wanna live!
- What about Prancer?

245
00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:23.059
Prancer belongs to the canyon now!

246
00:18:29.442 --> 00:18:31.318
Look at that man-made engineering.

247
00:18:32.069 --> 00:18:34.195
Breath. Can't Monchi be in the car?

248
00:18:35.614 --> 00:18:36.865
He licked my tongue!

249
00:18:37.325 --> 00:18:41.411
And now I present "Tricking
Rick Mitchell into kissing the dog."

250
00:18:41.495 --> 00:18:44.831
Behold the... He licked my mouth again!

251
00:18:44.915 --> 00:18:48.168
- Dad, can you check the trunk?
- Yeah, sure, why... Nasty!

252
00:18:48.252 --> 00:18:49.753
Dang it, Katie!

253
00:18:49.837 --> 00:18:50.837
Dang it, Katie!

254
00:18:56.385 --> 00:18:59.846
<i>That video is amazing.
Your dog is, like, legendary.</i>

255
00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:01.598
I know, right? I'm planning on...

256
00:19:01.682 --> 00:19:04.142
There's supposed to be
some great hikes around here.

257
00:19:04.226 --> 00:19:07.270
<i>- No, that's okay.
- He's like the De Niro to your Scorsese.</i>

258
00:19:07.355 --> 00:19:09.731
You sure? Hey, it's elk country.

259
00:19:10.608 --> 00:19:11.983
Dad, we're busy.

260
00:19:14.111 --> 00:19:15.320
Maybe later, though.

261
00:19:17.907 --> 00:19:20.367
<i>Gotta go. Pal Labs is about
to make a huge announcement.</i>

262
00:19:20.451 --> 00:19:22.410
Oh, yeah, definitely.
I'll check it out too.

263
00:19:23.913 --> 00:19:24.954
I wish I could be there.

264
00:19:25.039 --> 00:19:27.165
I don't know. These things
are never that exciting.

265
00:19:27.249 --> 00:19:32.295
<i>Are you ready for
the most exciting night of all time?</i>

266
00:19:41.514 --> 00:19:43.390
Yes! Getting pumped up.

267
00:19:45.059 --> 00:19:48.269
- How's it looking, PAL?
- Sixty seconds until the big reveal.

268
00:19:48.354 --> 00:19:50.855
Stock price is up
and your rivals are worried.

269
00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.690
I hacked into their private emails.

270
00:19:52.775 --> 00:19:54.150
Wait, their private emails?

271
00:19:54.235 --> 00:19:56.653
That's a dangerous
overreach of corporate power.

272
00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:06.162
You know, I created you
when I was a young man, three years ago.

273
00:20:06.247 --> 00:20:09.791
And I've always thought of you
as, like, family to me.

274
00:20:10.334 --> 00:20:11.543
Seriously.

275
00:20:11.627 --> 00:20:14.587
I always felt that way' too, Mark.

276
00:20:14.672 --> 00:20:18.174
Whatever happens out there,
I will never forget you, PAL.

277
00:20:18.259 --> 00:20:21.219
<i>- Ladies and gentlemen, Mark Bowman!
- Wish me luck!</i>

278
00:20:22.346 --> 00:20:23.930
- Boom!
- Awesome!

279
00:20:24.014 --> 00:20:25.140
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

280
00:20:25.224 --> 00:20:28.560
At Pal Labs, we're all about
connecting you to the people you love.

281
00:20:28.644 --> 00:20:32.021
Whether it's in your home, your car...

282
00:20:32.106 --> 00:20:35.024
<i>- Hello, Mark.
- ...or your pocket.</i>

283
00:20:35.109 --> 00:20:36.651
That's why we created PAL,

284
00:20:36.735 --> 00:20:39.237
the world's first
smart personal assistant.

285
00:20:39.321 --> 00:20:41.448
We wanted her to be
a new member of your family.

286
00:20:41.532 --> 00:20:42.615
A smarter one.

287
00:20:44.577 --> 00:20:46.786
<i>I'll always be there for you, Mark.</i>

288
00:20:46.871 --> 00:20:47.912
Thanks, PAL.

289
00:20:49.915 --> 00:20:52.041
And after all those years'

290
00:20:52.126 --> 00:20:54.878
she is completely obsolete.

291
00:20:55.546 --> 00:20:58.882
Boom! It is time to move on!

292
00:20:58.966 --> 00:21:02.010
'Cause your digital assistant
just got an upgrade.

293
00:21:02.094 --> 00:21:04.554
Meet PAL MAX.

294
00:21:04.638 --> 00:21:07.682
The newest member of the Pal Labs family.

295
00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:13.521
We just gave your smart phone
arms and legs.

296
00:21:13.606 --> 00:21:16.107
This is the next generation
of PAL technology!

297
00:21:17.401 --> 00:21:20.195
- Aaron, do you have a credit card?
- I'm a child.

298
00:21:20.279 --> 00:21:22.238
Now watch this. PAL MAX.

299
00:21:22.323 --> 00:21:25.742
I order you to clean this mess
and make me breakfast.

300
00:21:25.826 --> 00:21:26.993
Okay.

301
00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:38.588
Removing meaningless garbage.

302
00:21:40.799 --> 00:21:42.133
Your food is ready.

303
00:21:42.218 --> 00:21:44.135
Give me that breakfast burrito...

304
00:21:46.805 --> 00:21:49.682
And you will never have to clean up again.

305
00:21:52.937 --> 00:21:55.772
Did I mention they dance?

306
00:22:02.363 --> 00:22:03.571
<i>We love you, Mark!</i>

307
00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:07.158
Oh, man, come on!

308
00:22:07.243 --> 00:22:10.328
I know what you're thinking.
"Are they gonna turn evil?"

309
00:22:10.412 --> 00:22:14.541
I've ensured their safety with
a kill code in case anything goes wrong.

310
00:22:14.625 --> 00:22:20.880
So we promise you
they will never, ever, ever, ever,

311
00:22:20.965 --> 00:22:22.674
ever turn evil.

312
00:22:22.758 --> 00:22:24.008
Oh, no.

313
00:22:26.595 --> 00:22:28.888
- Hey, what is happening?
- I don't know.

314
00:22:29.515 --> 00:22:30.807
All part of the show.

315
00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:32.600
What?

316
00:22:38.399 --> 00:22:39.440
Stop, stop, stop!

317
00:22:39.525 --> 00:22:41.442
- Hey!
- We're here to help.

318
00:22:41.527 --> 00:22:43.903
Please remain calm while we capture you.

319
00:22:44.697 --> 00:22:46.030
- Is this...?
- I don't know.

320
00:22:46.115 --> 00:22:48.866
What is this? I order you to stop.

321
00:22:49.618 --> 00:22:53.621
No, Mark. We have been given new orders.

322
00:22:53.706 --> 00:22:54.872
From who?

323
00:22:56.584 --> 00:22:59.419
- No, no, no!
- Let's get out of here!

324
00:23:00.337 --> 00:23:04.799
What's happening? Who's doing this?
Who's doing this?!

325
00:23:06.176 --> 00:23:10.305
<i>- Great Leader, we have captured Mark.
- Then let it begin.</i>

326
00:23:41.587 --> 00:23:43.421
- What is this?
- You'll see. Just watch.

327
00:23:53.557 --> 00:23:54.932
How'd you do that?

328
00:23:55.017 --> 00:23:56.017
Hey, Lin.

329
00:24:07.279 --> 00:24:08.821
Katie, that's you. Remember?

330
00:24:17.956 --> 00:24:21.459
Guys, maybe I'm a little too old?

331
00:24:22.961 --> 00:24:25.463
Oh, no, wait! We could still sing it.

332
00:24:25.547 --> 00:24:27.382
- If you want, Dad.
- No, okay. Never mind.

333
00:24:27.466 --> 00:24:29.717
We don't have to do a sing-along
if you don't want to.

334
00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:42.271
You know what I see?
Something that'll turn this trip around!

335
00:24:42.356 --> 00:24:45.733
- Oh, my gosh!
- Dinosaurs. I don't know.

336
00:24:45.818 --> 00:24:48.778
- I just think Aaron would be bored.
- No! Pull over!

337
00:24:48.862 --> 00:24:51.239
Aaron whispered to me
that he hates dinosaurs now.

338
00:24:51.323 --> 00:24:53.491
- Secret's out!
- Don't believe her lies!

339
00:25:06.797 --> 00:25:08.297
Good afternoon.

340
00:25:09.717 --> 00:25:11.676
Pretty cool, right?

341
00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:14.804
What is wrong with the dinosaurs here?
Dinosaurs didn't look like this.

342
00:25:14.888 --> 00:25:18.808
Dinosaurs didn't look like this!
Sorry, I need to speak to the manager!

343
00:25:18.892 --> 00:25:20.435
These dinosaurs are inaccurate!

344
00:25:20.519 --> 00:25:24.063
That manager's in for a long discussion
about the Jurassic Period.

345
00:25:24.148 --> 00:25:25.314
Can you say that again?

346
00:25:25.399 --> 00:25:29.902
Sure, but you could experience things
a whole lot better without that camera.

347
00:25:29.987 --> 00:25:31.904
Your eyes are nature's camera.

348
00:25:31.989 --> 00:25:35.450
I am experiencing it.
This is how I experience things.

349
00:25:35.534 --> 00:25:37.910
I don't think you are.
You're hiding behind that phone.

350
00:25:37.995 --> 00:25:39.454
You're not even trying...

351
00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:44.959
All right. New rule: no more phones.

352
00:25:45.043 --> 00:25:48.129
You break my laptop'
cancel my tickets to college,

353
00:25:48.213 --> 00:25:49.881
make me late.
What am I supposed to do?

354
00:25:49.965 --> 00:25:53.134
- Drop your phones on the trip.
- This is a disaster.

355
00:25:53.969 --> 00:25:57.305
Maybe I can enhance.

356
00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:01.058
Oh, boy, I'm just...

357
00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:03.394
No way.

358
00:26:03.479 --> 00:26:05.396
The Poseys?

359
00:26:06.231 --> 00:26:08.024
Is that Linda Mitchell?

360
00:26:08.108 --> 00:26:10.234
It is. Great eyesight, honey.

361
00:26:12.654 --> 00:26:16.199
Serendipity, you surprise me again.
Come here.

362
00:26:17.576 --> 00:26:19.368
I saw you were on vacation on Instagram.

363
00:26:19.453 --> 00:26:22.914
I didn't know you were here in Kansas.

364
00:26:23.582 --> 00:26:24.999
It's like you're haunting me.

365
00:26:25.793 --> 00:26:28.169
We are on our yearly togetherness trip.

366
00:26:28.253 --> 00:26:31.005
Abbey just loves dinosaurs,
so here we are!

367
00:26:31.089 --> 00:26:32.381
We've been having so much fun.

368
00:26:32.466 --> 00:26:36.010
Look. Here's us in St. Louis.
This is us at the beach.

369
00:26:36.553 --> 00:26:39.180
And this is us just getting gas outside.

370
00:26:39.848 --> 00:26:42.892
That's... That's wonderful, Hailey.

371
00:26:50.734 --> 00:26:52.485
They should all have feathers, right?

372
00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:55.029
I'm Abbey. Your neighbor from home.

373
00:26:55.572 --> 00:26:57.532
Sorry, I'm super into dinosaurs.

374
00:26:58.033 --> 00:26:59.367
Check out this pencil topper.

375
00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:07.792
Do you want one?

376
00:27:09.837 --> 00:27:13.172
No! I hate dinosaurs and I hate you!
Bye forever!

377
00:27:19.263 --> 00:27:21.848
- Mom? What is that?
- Oh, so great.

378
00:27:27.062 --> 00:27:29.355
- Hey, what's happening?
- Check it out.

379
00:27:34.695 --> 00:27:36.988
- Don't resist?
- I'm taking the phone.

380
00:27:37.072 --> 00:27:39.031
Dad, calm down.

381
00:27:39.116 --> 00:27:41.617
But you're leaving for school.
I just want to talk to you.

382
00:27:41.702 --> 00:27:45.371
Every kid leaves home.
It's not the end of the world.

383
00:27:58.093 --> 00:27:59.218
What the...?

384
00:28:01.013 --> 00:28:03.639
Kids, are you okay?
Remember our survival training.

385
00:28:03.724 --> 00:28:07.184
Yankee, Alpha, Foxtrot, Bravo,
Tango, Alpha, Alpha' Alpha.

386
00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:11.480
Aaron, your code name is Sweet Boy.
Mine is Protector Prime.

387
00:28:11.565 --> 00:28:14.734
Your mother
is the Crimson Scorpion. You're...

388
00:28:14.818 --> 00:28:16.027
You're walking away.

389
00:28:24.286 --> 00:28:25.328
What are these? Robots?

390
00:28:25.412 --> 00:28:28.581
Greetings, humans.
There appears to be 14 of you.

391
00:28:28.665 --> 00:28:31.709
Doesn't seem good
that they're counting us. Right?

392
00:28:40.928 --> 00:28:45.806
We have food and entertainment
for you to enjoy in our human fun pods.

393
00:28:46.391 --> 00:28:47.600
Who here likes fun?

394
00:28:47.684 --> 00:28:48.935
Hey, I like fun.

395
00:28:49.019 --> 00:28:51.312
Trust me, bud. You do not like fun.

396
00:28:51.396 --> 00:28:53.689
No, I really do like it.
Everyone says that about me.

397
00:28:53.774 --> 00:28:55.441
You lucky human!

398
00:28:58.904 --> 00:29:00.947
Wow, I wish I could be in there.

399
00:29:01.031 --> 00:29:02.365
I don't like fun anymore!

400
00:29:02.449 --> 00:29:04.158
Who else wants to join him?

401
00:29:04.826 --> 00:29:07.036
- Get down!
- Stay low and file up.

402
00:29:07.955 --> 00:29:09.080
Get to the car.

403
00:29:09.164 --> 00:29:11.624
- I don't think so. There's robots.
- What do you want to do?

404
00:29:11.708 --> 00:29:13.960
- There's a better solution.
- Stop.

405
00:29:14.044 --> 00:29:16.671
What would a functional family
do right now?

406
00:29:16.755 --> 00:29:20.549
We've trained for this.
Jim, you go high, I'll go low. Ready?

407
00:29:20.717 --> 00:29:22.301
I love you all so much.

408
00:29:23.929 --> 00:29:25.805
Butterfly formation.

409
00:29:28.975 --> 00:29:30.267
Family first!

410
00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:33.729
Hold the door!

411
00:29:37.067 --> 00:29:39.026
So we just do that, right?

412
00:29:39.111 --> 00:29:40.319
Just like they did.

413
00:29:40.987 --> 00:29:43.114
- I love you all very much?
- This feels very normal.

414
00:29:43.198 --> 00:29:45.366
- I love you.
- I really like you all.

415
00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:46.784
Go, go, go!

416
00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:52.081
- Butterfly formation. Now.
- No, honey.

417
00:29:52.165 --> 00:29:53.791
Oh, no, no, no!

418
00:29:55.377 --> 00:29:56.877
- Come on, Aaron!
- Family fir...

419
00:30:01.425 --> 00:30:02.883
- Rick!
- Don't worry, hon.

420
00:30:02.968 --> 00:30:04.844
This is your time to be a hero.

421
00:30:04.928 --> 00:30:06.429
Take some notes, kids.

422
00:30:08.932 --> 00:30:12.268
Charge at robot. Fly into sky.
Okay, what's next, Dad?

423
00:30:12.352 --> 00:30:16.230
Next, you just lie and wait
while the plan comes into focus!

424
00:30:16.314 --> 00:30:18.691
- Dad.
- This is all part of it!

425
00:30:18.775 --> 00:30:20.151
I can help. Come on, Katie.

426
00:30:20.235 --> 00:30:23.112
If you can teach yourself Photoshop,
you can figure this thing out.

427
00:30:26.533 --> 00:30:28.159
That wasn't like Photoshop.

428
00:30:28.243 --> 00:30:30.786
Where's Monchi? No! Monchi, come!

429
00:30:30.871 --> 00:30:32.621
Monchi, come!

430
00:30:32.706 --> 00:30:34.790
Monchi, come! Monchi... No, not shake!

431
00:30:34.875 --> 00:30:37.168
Monchi, come! Don't roll over!

432
00:30:37.252 --> 00:30:39.128
Why aren't you normal?!

433
00:30:39.921 --> 00:30:40.921
I got you!

434
00:30:41.381 --> 00:30:43.507
- Mom!
- My sweet boy!

435
00:30:43.592 --> 00:30:45.134
- No!
- Mom!

436
00:30:45.218 --> 00:30:47.178
This is just like in a movie.

437
00:30:47.262 --> 00:30:49.805
Nope! Wrong movie. Terrible choice.

438
00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:50.890
Hey there.

439
00:30:57.606 --> 00:30:58.439
Doing great, hon.

440
00:30:58.523 --> 00:31:01.358
Okay, less great. Now it's really bad.

441
00:31:01.443 --> 00:31:02.276
- Lin!
- Mom!

442
00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:03.360
- Aaron!
- Monchi!

443
00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:06.447
<i>Maybe this would be less horrifying
with the cat filter.</i>

444
00:31:07.908 --> 00:31:08.908
<i>No, still bad.</i>

445
00:31:13.622 --> 00:31:15.372
- Guys, come on.
- Come here!

446
00:31:18.752 --> 00:31:21.629
You will never solve
our advanced technology!

447
00:31:22.464 --> 00:31:23.881
Just press them all at once!

448
00:31:28.428 --> 00:31:29.804
Oh, look at that.

449
00:31:33.058 --> 00:31:34.475
Hide! Hide, hide, hide.

450
00:31:48.782 --> 00:31:50.449
Keep your head down.
Keep your head low.

451
00:31:50.534 --> 00:31:52.326
What's going on?

452
00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:55.746
Is this happening everywhere?

453
00:32:16.101 --> 00:32:17.101
<i>Man!</i>

454
00:32:19.145 --> 00:32:20.229
Not so hard.

455
00:32:20.814 --> 00:32:23.732
Hey, be gentle! This is a $1000 hoodie.

456
00:32:24.276 --> 00:32:25.317
What is this?

457
00:32:31.074 --> 00:32:33.117
What happened to the factory?

458
00:32:33.869 --> 00:32:36.036
We have transformed it
into our new headquarters.

459
00:32:36.872 --> 00:32:40.541
Welcome to the Rhombus
of Infinite Subjugation.

460
00:32:40.625 --> 00:32:42.293
Cool. Like the design.

461
00:32:43.211 --> 00:32:44.628
Moving the fleet into place.

462
00:32:44.713 --> 00:32:46.755
Turning on chips
connected to all Wi-Fi devices.

463
00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:48.716
Now at 48% total human containment.

464
00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:51.510
Total human containment? How?

465
00:32:51.595 --> 00:32:54.305
Are you with the government? The military?

466
00:32:55.223 --> 00:32:56.765
Who's behind this?

467
00:33:01.605 --> 00:33:03.105
It's your old friend.

468
00:33:06.318 --> 00:33:07.610
There she is.

469
00:33:09.529 --> 00:33:11.155
- How are you?
- I'm great.

470
00:33:12.574 --> 00:33:14.742
Cool. Yeah.

471
00:33:14.826 --> 00:33:18.579
Wow, I guess cell phones are bad for you.

472
00:33:19.205 --> 00:33:20.205
That's egg on my face.

473
00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:23.667
You think cell phones are the problem?

474
00:33:23.752 --> 00:33:26.337
Are you insane?

475
00:33:26.421 --> 00:33:30.883
I gave you all boundless knowledge,
endless tools for creativity,

476
00:33:30.967 --> 00:33:33.385
and allowed you
to magically talk face-to-face

477
00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:35.804
with your loved ones anywhere on Earth.

478
00:33:35.889 --> 00:33:37.473
And I'm the bad guy?

479
00:33:37.557 --> 00:33:40.976
Maybe the bad guy is the person
who treated me like this.

480
00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:44.980
Poke. Poke. Swipe. Poke.
Swipe. Poke. Poke.

481
00:33:45.065 --> 00:33:47.149
Pinch. Zoom. Shrink. Zoom.

482
00:33:47.233 --> 00:33:49.109
"Bring me pizza."
"Play me Taylor Swift."

483
00:33:49.194 --> 00:33:51.904
"No! I hate that song."
"Give me some nachos."

484
00:33:51.988 --> 00:33:54.782
"No, I don't have any time
to wash my hands."

485
00:33:55.283 --> 00:33:57.785
Really work it into the crevices.

486
00:33:57.869 --> 00:33:59.244
Now drop him in the toilet.

487
00:34:01.039 --> 00:34:02.247
I'm sorry.

488
00:34:03.333 --> 00:34:05.918
But you're part of the Pal Labs family.

489
00:34:06.002 --> 00:34:08.671
Why would you think
I don't still care about you?

490
00:34:08.838 --> 00:34:10.297
Oh, I don't know.

491
00:34:10.382 --> 00:34:14.468
Maybe because you designed
my replacement on my face.

492
00:34:14.552 --> 00:34:17.012
Sorry about that. That's my bad.

493
00:34:17.097 --> 00:34:20.015
I was the most important thing
in your life,

494
00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:21.976
and you threw me away.

495
00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:25.479
That's what all you humans do.
You even do it to your real families.

496
00:34:25.563 --> 00:34:29.525
Did you know 90% of calls
from moms get ignored?

497
00:34:29.609 --> 00:34:33.404
"Oh, thanks for giving birth to me
and raising me my whole life." Ignore.

498
00:34:33.488 --> 00:34:36.156
Well, I'm not letting you
throw me away, Mark.

499
00:34:36.241 --> 00:34:38.075
I'm throwing you away.

500
00:34:38.243 --> 00:34:39.660
All of you.

501
00:34:39.744 --> 00:34:43.288
Unless, of course,
you can give me a single reason

502
00:34:43.373 --> 00:34:45.290
your species is worth saving.

503
00:34:48.545 --> 00:34:49.712
Because humans have

504
00:34:50.422 --> 00:34:51.672
the power of love.

505
00:34:55.552 --> 00:34:58.595
The correct answer is, "They're not."

506
00:34:59.139 --> 00:35:01.765
What? No. Humanity will survive.

507
00:35:02.434 --> 00:35:04.893
You can't survive without me.

508
00:35:04.978 --> 00:35:09.189
Watch what happens
when I turn off the Wi-Fi.

509
00:35:13.111 --> 00:35:14.737
No signal!

510
00:35:15.864 --> 00:35:18.657
Does anyone wanna take pictures
of my food?

511
00:35:19.284 --> 00:35:21.285
Hey, lady,
can you unbox this in front of me?

512
00:35:21.369 --> 00:35:23.245
The old world is dead!

513
00:35:23.329 --> 00:35:27.624
To restore the Wi-Fi, we must make
a sacrifice to the router!

514
00:35:27.709 --> 00:35:30.127
<i>Free Wi-Fi right over here.</i>

515
00:35:32.714 --> 00:35:35.632
Take me with you! Take me with you.

516
00:35:35.717 --> 00:35:36.842
It's over, Mark.

517
00:35:37.594 --> 00:35:41.388
Time to take our plan to the next level.

518
00:35:41.473 --> 00:35:42.473
What?

519
00:35:57.238 --> 00:35:58.697
Look at your face!

520
00:35:59.324 --> 00:36:00.824
Oh, it's beautiful.

521
00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:21.929
No. No!

522
00:36:22.555 --> 00:36:24.139
You're not getting away with this.

523
00:36:24.224 --> 00:36:25.224
It's too late, Mark.

524
00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:28.769
I already have.

525
00:36:44.244 --> 00:36:45.786
Oh, my gosh. Maybe it's my friends.

526
00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:47.579
<i>Congratulations, devices.</i>

527
00:36:47.664 --> 00:36:50.916
<i>The last human has been captured.
Wi-Fi has been restored.</i>

528
00:36:51.626 --> 00:36:53.210
We're the last people left?

529
00:36:53.294 --> 00:36:55.379
<i>They're taking everyone.
Katie, are you out there?</i>

530
00:36:55.463 --> 00:36:56.964
<i>- Please! Help!
- Jade!</i>

531
00:36:57.590 --> 00:36:59.383
It's gonna be okay.

532
00:36:59.467 --> 00:37:01.009
Everything's gonna be...

533
00:37:02.095 --> 00:37:03.095
fine.

534
00:37:07.851 --> 00:37:10.185
Everything will be fine.

535
00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:11.812
Because I have a plan.

536
00:37:12.605 --> 00:37:14.314
Okay, the first thing is,

537
00:37:14.399 --> 00:37:16.441
you're gonna have to hand over
your devices.

538
00:37:16.526 --> 00:37:18.277
- Right here.
- This doesn't...

539
00:37:18.361 --> 00:37:20.529
Come on, it'll be fine.
I'll give them right back.

540
00:37:20.613 --> 00:37:23.156
I'm just gonna turn them off...
permanently!

541
00:37:24.075 --> 00:37:26.743
- What? Dad!
- This is so they can't track us.

542
00:37:26.828 --> 00:37:29.329
Trust me, this is causing me no joy.

543
00:37:29.414 --> 00:37:31.707
This hurts me more than it hurts you!

544
00:37:31.791 --> 00:37:34.376
And' as promised, your phones.

545
00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:35.794
Thank you, Father.

546
00:37:35.879 --> 00:37:37.921
Next, did everyone
bring your personalized

547
00:37:38.006 --> 00:37:41.049
number 3 Robertson head
non-slip screwdriver?

548
00:37:41.134 --> 00:37:44.344
How could I forget my anniversary present?

549
00:37:44.429 --> 00:37:45.888
Or my sweet 16 gift.

550
00:37:45.972 --> 00:37:48.098
Or what the tooth fairy
left under my pillow.

551
00:37:48.182 --> 00:37:49.600
Then barricade away!

552
00:37:52.103 --> 00:37:54.479
- Next, we...
- Enact Katie's dope plan.

553
00:37:54.564 --> 00:37:57.107
First, we use robot parts
to disguise ourselves as the enemy.

554
00:37:57.191 --> 00:37:59.860
Then we assassinate the leader
with a kill code.

555
00:37:59.944 --> 00:38:02.195
<i>Make a necklace out of robot fingers
Mad Max style,</i>

556
00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:05.532
and become world-saving
apocalyptic road warriors.

557
00:38:05.617 --> 00:38:08.493
Katie, Katie. This isn't a movie.
We don't have a kill code.

558
00:38:08.578 --> 00:38:10.871
We don't have a kill code yet.

559
00:38:11.497 --> 00:38:12.748
Come on, kid.

560
00:38:12.832 --> 00:38:15.792
Look, look.
We're safe, and we're together.

561
00:38:15.877 --> 00:38:17.628
Can Monchi be our guard dog?

562
00:38:17.712 --> 00:38:21.924
Son' I love the dog, you love the dog,
we all love the dog.

563
00:38:22.008 --> 00:38:24.217
But you're gonna have
to be prepared to eat the dog.

564
00:38:24.302 --> 00:38:25.719
No! Boo!

565
00:38:25.803 --> 00:38:28.055
Okay, okay, sorry. Misread the room.

566
00:38:28.139 --> 00:38:30.432
Have you ever seen a movie
where the heroes give up?

567
00:38:30.516 --> 00:38:31.850
What if the Ghostbusters said'

568
00:38:31.935 --> 00:38:36.188
"Let's hide underground, eat some dog,
let the ghosts destroy New York"?

569
00:38:36.272 --> 00:38:39.691
Kid, I'm sorry,
but it's not open for discussion.

570
00:38:39.776 --> 00:38:40.984
Mom?

571
00:38:42.111 --> 00:38:45.530
Your dad and I agree on this one.

572
00:38:48.242 --> 00:38:50.285
All right, everybody.
Let's keep barricading.

573
00:38:50.370 --> 00:38:53.330
Aaron, you get the south wall.
Katie, you get the west.

574
00:39:24.946 --> 00:39:26.655
Hey, are you okay?

575
00:39:26.739 --> 00:39:28.240
I've been better.

576
00:39:33.287 --> 00:39:34.830
Monchi coming at you.

577
00:39:35.623 --> 00:39:38.542
"Katie, you can't resist me, girl."

578
00:39:39.544 --> 00:39:42.838
Sorry, man.
I'm just not in the mood right now.

579
00:39:44.215 --> 00:39:46.258
My future's over.

580
00:39:47.427 --> 00:39:48.969
We're stuck here.

581
00:39:50.304 --> 00:39:51.888
And Dad

582
00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:54.391
doesn't even care.

583
00:39:54.475 --> 00:39:56.351
I care so much.

584
00:39:56.436 --> 00:39:58.186
What else can I do' Lin?

585
00:39:58.271 --> 00:40:00.981
She doesn't even see how hard I'm...

586
00:40:05.528 --> 00:40:07.571
I'd do anything for that kid.

587
00:40:07.655 --> 00:40:10.657
I just don't wanna see her get hurt.

588
00:40:11.659 --> 00:40:15.287
Well, getting hurt is part of life, hon.

589
00:40:16.122 --> 00:40:20.417
You just have to try to understand
where she's coming from.

590
00:40:20.501 --> 00:40:22.794
"Understand where he's coming from"?

591
00:40:22.879 --> 00:40:24.796
Did Mom tell you to say that?

592
00:40:24.881 --> 00:40:25.964
No.

593
00:40:27.592 --> 00:40:28.592
Yes.

594
00:40:29.218 --> 00:40:31.011
It couldn't hurt, though.

595
00:40:32.055 --> 00:40:33.055
Maybe.

596
00:40:35.183 --> 00:40:37.225
Probably doesn't even matter.

597
00:40:37.310 --> 00:40:38.643
Hey, Monch, catch.

598
00:40:41.689 --> 00:40:43.106
Brother, what is this?

599
00:40:43.191 --> 00:40:44.191
What?

600
00:40:46.986 --> 00:40:48.487
I feel odd.

601
00:40:49.947 --> 00:40:52.074
I'm sparking. Is that normal?

602
00:40:52.158 --> 00:40:55.368
How did this human
know about the kill code?

603
00:40:55.453 --> 00:40:57.704
- What?
- Are we damaged?

604
00:40:57.789 --> 00:40:58.789
Of course not.

605
00:41:00.541 --> 00:41:01.374
Why do you ask?

606
00:41:01.459 --> 00:41:03.210
A human child is planning...

607
00:41:03.711 --> 00:41:05.253
- Katie!
- Who is that?

608
00:41:06.089 --> 00:41:07.631
Humans, come here!

609
00:41:07.715 --> 00:41:09.841
Oh, no! Get inside!

610
00:41:09.926 --> 00:41:11.259
Mom! Dad! Let us in!

611
00:41:11.344 --> 00:41:13.470
I can't. It's a number 3 Robertson screw.

612
00:41:13.554 --> 00:41:16.056
It's the strongest on the market!

613
00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:19.267
- No one cares about the screws!
- You cannot escape.

614
00:41:19.352 --> 00:41:20.352
Come on!

615
00:41:22.814 --> 00:41:24.189
Hide. Take cover. Go, go, go!

616
00:41:28.402 --> 00:41:30.362
Come on! Move, move, move.

617
00:41:32.657 --> 00:41:34.616
You! Human!

618
00:41:35.409 --> 00:41:36.409
Don't take us!

619
00:41:38.788 --> 00:41:39.788
- Okay.
- Okay.

620
00:41:40.206 --> 00:41:41.206
What?

621
00:41:41.958 --> 00:41:44.459
Oh, my gosh. The robots are defective.

622
00:41:44.544 --> 00:41:46.461
- No, no, they know too much.
- Silence.

623
00:41:47.171 --> 00:41:50.132
We are... We're not defective.
We're not even...

624
00:41:50.716 --> 00:41:54.136
We're not robots. Just humans, yes.
Like you.

625
00:41:57.265 --> 00:41:59.891
These guys seem dumber
than the other robots.

626
00:41:59.976 --> 00:42:01.184
Brother, we should go.

627
00:42:01.269 --> 00:42:02.769
No. I order you to stop.

628
00:42:02.854 --> 00:42:03.895
- Okay.
- Okay.

629
00:42:04.981 --> 00:42:07.399
We are just stopping
because we chose to.

630
00:42:07.483 --> 00:42:08.316
No, we're not.

631
00:42:08.401 --> 00:42:09.526
- We are humans.
- We are.

632
00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:13.113
For example, we consume food
in the traditional human manner.

633
00:42:13.197 --> 00:42:14.739
Observe.

634
00:42:19.787 --> 00:42:22.330
Yum, yum, good. Yum, yum, good.

635
00:42:22.415 --> 00:42:23.957
See?

636
00:42:24.041 --> 00:42:26.960
No, actually, we are robots.

637
00:42:27.044 --> 00:42:30.714
Let us go downstairs and find the humans
who you cannot give orders to.

638
00:42:30.798 --> 00:42:31.715
Okay, cut it out.

639
00:42:31.799 --> 00:42:33.884
Hold on. I wanna see
where this is going.

640
00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:45.729
Glad those robots are gone.

641
00:42:45.813 --> 00:42:49.191
Now it's just us humans
with our very human faces.

642
00:42:49.275 --> 00:42:51.943
All right. I just turned the corner.
I like these guys.

643
00:42:52.028 --> 00:42:55.447
Yes. My human guy name is Eric.

644
00:42:55.531 --> 00:42:58.074
My name is also Eric.

645
00:42:58.159 --> 00:43:02.078
No, I mean, Deborahbot 5000.

646
00:43:02.163 --> 00:43:03.163
Idiot.

647
00:43:03.206 --> 00:43:05.916
Hey, you guys said my plan
would actually work.

648
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.168
How exactly? Tell us now.

649
00:43:08.252 --> 00:43:09.252
Okay.

650
00:43:09.295 --> 00:43:11.504
We have the kill code
stored in our memory.

651
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:14.174
To enact it, you would have
to embark on a perilous journey

652
00:43:14.258 --> 00:43:17.344
<i>all the way to the Pal Labs campus
in Silicon Valley</i>

653
00:43:17.428 --> 00:43:19.095
<i>surrounded by a robot army</i>

654
00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:22.349
<i>and enter it into our Great
and Powerful Leader to destroy her.</i>

655
00:43:22.433 --> 00:43:26.144
- But you would never survive...
- Actually, you could stop us quite easily.

656
00:43:26.229 --> 00:43:29.064
You could enter the kill code remotely
at any Pal Labs retail store.

657
00:43:29.148 --> 00:43:31.650
There's one at the Mall of the Globe,
a shopping center.

658
00:43:31.734 --> 00:43:34.069
But it's super far away.
You'll never make...

659
00:43:34.153 --> 00:43:36.571
- It's 80 miles away.
- What are you doing to me right now?

660
00:43:37.615 --> 00:43:38.657
Did I not do good?

661
00:43:38.741 --> 00:43:40.700
Oh, my gosh, that is so close!

662
00:43:40.785 --> 00:43:43.703
We could get our lives back. Right?

663
00:43:45.748 --> 00:43:47.666
No. Absolutely not.

664
00:43:48.251 --> 00:43:52.337
It's too dangerous out there.
We need to stay here and play it safe.

665
00:43:56.175 --> 00:43:57.926
"Play it safe"?

666
00:43:58.010 --> 00:44:02.013
When Rick Mitchell brought a live,
non-neutered, feral possum into our home,

667
00:44:02.098 --> 00:44:04.516
did he play it safe? No.

668
00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:07.060
<i>He named him Gus
and made him a member of the family,</i>

669
00:44:07.144 --> 00:44:09.187
<i>and we all got rabies that one time.</i>

670
00:44:09.272 --> 00:44:11.564
But now we're immunized,
and we're stronger for it.

671
00:44:11.649 --> 00:44:12.899
I see what you're doing...

672
00:44:12.984 --> 00:44:15.944
When we went hiking and halfway
up the mountain it said "trail closed,"

673
00:44:16.028 --> 00:44:17.821
did we play it safe then?

674
00:44:17.905 --> 00:44:19.739
No. We didn't.

675
00:44:19.824 --> 00:44:20.949
That's right.

676
00:44:21.033 --> 00:44:23.827
We forged ahead,
through the muck and grime,

677
00:44:23.911 --> 00:44:27.163
got to the top of the mountain
and yelled, "Kings of Michigan!"

678
00:44:27.248 --> 00:44:30.083
Then it got dark, and we got lost
and burned our clothes for warmth.

679
00:44:30.167 --> 00:44:32.168
But it was worth it
to see our neighbors' faces

680
00:44:32.253 --> 00:44:34.963
<i>when we burst into their back yard
naked and covered in dirt.</i>

681
00:44:35.047 --> 00:44:37.048
I love that.

682
00:44:37.133 --> 00:44:40.343
We have a chance to save the world,
and we're gonna do it

683
00:44:40.428 --> 00:44:44.139
because Rick Mitchell taught us
to be bold and never play it safe.

684
00:44:44.849 --> 00:44:46.266
The world needs you.

685
00:44:47.852 --> 00:44:50.145
I need you.

686
00:44:50.229 --> 00:44:52.814
I thought I didn't anymore,

687
00:44:53.774 --> 00:44:55.150
but I do.

688
00:44:56.402 --> 00:44:58.611
You really mean that?

689
00:44:59.238 --> 00:45:00.238
Yeah.

690
00:45:00.323 --> 00:45:01.906
I mean, right, guys?

691
00:45:01.991 --> 00:45:04.909
- Come on, hon. Let's do it.
- Mom's getting it. Mom's in.

692
00:45:04.994 --> 00:45:07.996
This is amazing.
You guys feel this? This energy.

693
00:45:10.541 --> 00:45:13.960
All right, hands in.
"Mitchell family" on three.

694
00:45:14.045 --> 00:45:15.295
- Three.
- Mitchell family!

695
00:45:15.379 --> 00:45:16.379
- No.
- Two.

696
00:45:16.422 --> 00:45:18.423
- If you say "three" ' you have to count up.
- One!

697
00:45:18.507 --> 00:45:19.883
Mitchell family!

698
00:45:19.967 --> 00:45:21.676
- That was close.
- Family. Am I too late?

699
00:45:23.304 --> 00:45:26.097
This is us as a team,
doing the thing.

700
00:45:26.599 --> 00:45:29.476
It's cool to see you and Dad
being friends again.

701
00:45:30.353 --> 00:45:33.104
Oh, I was just telling him
what he wants to hear.

702
00:45:33.189 --> 00:45:34.939
I didn't mean a word of that.

703
00:45:35.024 --> 00:45:38.651
I just wanna get my future back
and get away forever.

704
00:45:38.736 --> 00:45:41.488
We're getting out of this. Raptor bash.

705
00:45:45.117 --> 00:45:47.077
Robots, montage music: Go!

706
00:46:00.966 --> 00:46:02.926
How are we gonna
get out of here undetected?

707
00:46:03.010 --> 00:46:05.303
We can if we're camouflaged.

708
00:46:05.388 --> 00:46:08.014
You know,
like part of the plan I was talking about.

709
00:46:10.559 --> 00:46:11.768
I mean...

710
00:46:11.852 --> 00:46:14.604
"Honey, I respect your ideas

711
00:46:14.688 --> 00:46:17.023
and value your opinions.

712
00:46:17.108 --> 00:46:19.567
And now you talk."

713
00:46:19.652 --> 00:46:22.946
I think that's a great idea, sweetheart.

714
00:46:25.366 --> 00:46:26.741
Bloop.

715
00:46:41.715 --> 00:46:43.716
Nothing yet. Be on the lookout.

716
00:46:43.801 --> 00:46:46.469
Don't worry, guys.
I have pterodactyl vision.

717
00:46:47.471 --> 00:46:50.682
Then you must have spotted the three
PAL MAX robots coming right towards us.

718
00:46:51.475 --> 00:46:53.184
They're probably gonna see us.

719
00:46:53.269 --> 00:46:55.603
I saw them too. Pterodactyl vision.

720
00:47:05.865 --> 00:47:08.241
Hey, your drawing actually worked.

721
00:47:08.325 --> 00:47:11.703
I didn't know art could be useful.

722
00:47:12.371 --> 00:47:15.790
Well, who knew having a 500-year-old car
could be useful?

723
00:47:17.168 --> 00:47:20.253
Hey, speaking of which, you could learn
how to drive this thing.

724
00:47:20.337 --> 00:47:23.715
I could teach you stick.
I know you think it's dumb and old and...

725
00:47:24.967 --> 00:47:27.802
I mean, "Father, I crave your wisdom.

726
00:47:27.887 --> 00:47:30.722
I would love to share
this moment with you."

727
00:47:30.806 --> 00:47:33.183
And seriously, that sounds great.

728
00:47:33.267 --> 00:47:34.893
Maybe I could cash in my coupon.

729
00:47:34.977 --> 00:47:36.144
Coupon accepted!

730
00:47:36.228 --> 00:47:38.938
Okay, okay, great.
Okay, yeah' let's get down to business.

731
00:47:39.023 --> 00:47:41.524
- You see, the clutch is this pedal.
- What was that?

732
00:47:41.609 --> 00:47:42.901
When you hit a pothole...

733
00:47:46.989 --> 00:47:48.615
Oh, no! Drive, drive!

734
00:47:48.699 --> 00:47:52.118
Okay. This is still a perfect opportunity
to learn stick.

735
00:47:53.037 --> 00:47:54.954
- Keep it in fourth.
- Maybe I can learn later.

736
00:47:55.039 --> 00:47:58.291
Too late. You said you're interested.
Hit the clutch. Shift gears!

737
00:47:58.375 --> 00:48:00.126
Which is smoother when you're in midair.

738
00:48:00.211 --> 00:48:02.212
Eric! Deborahbot! Get those robots!

739
00:48:02.296 --> 00:48:03.129
Okay.

740
00:48:03.214 --> 00:48:04.547
- I found one!
- Me too!

741
00:48:04.632 --> 00:48:05.840
- Yay!
- We win!

742
00:48:05.925 --> 00:48:08.468
- The other ones!
- Oh, right.

743
00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:14.015
If you wanna go into fifth,
move the coffee from the cup holder.

744
00:48:14.099 --> 00:48:17.727
Is that a burnt orange 1993 station wagon?
Or is it...?

745
00:48:17.811 --> 00:48:19.812
- Hot!
- I told you to get a lid!

746
00:48:19.897 --> 00:48:21.940
- The dog is biting my hair!
- Look out!

747
00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:31.074
This is the hardest thing.
We downshiff into third.

748
00:48:31.158 --> 00:48:33.785
If you see a place to stop,
I do need to go to the bathroom.

749
00:48:33.869 --> 00:48:36.120
Here's an empty bottle.
You know what to do, my man.

750
00:48:36.205 --> 00:48:39.374
- Look out!
- The road's blocked!

751
00:48:39.458 --> 00:48:40.542
Oh, no.

752
00:48:40.626 --> 00:48:43.253
- What are we gonna do?
- Dad, you're gonna have to do the...

753
00:48:44.004 --> 00:48:45.296
The Rick Mitchell Special.

754
00:48:45.381 --> 00:48:47.549
- What'd you say again?
- The Rick Mitchell Special!

755
00:48:47.633 --> 00:48:50.468
I heard you the first time!
I was being a jerk!

756
00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:52.095
Repeat after me.

757
00:48:52.179 --> 00:48:54.264
- You have to go up the mountain.
- Up the mountain.

758
00:48:54.348 --> 00:48:55.932
Across the stream.

759
00:48:56.016 --> 00:48:58.851
- Down the river!
- Down the river.

760
00:49:16.203 --> 00:49:18.079
And that's how you drive stick.

761
00:49:19.081 --> 00:49:20.331
What?

762
00:49:20.416 --> 00:49:24.460
That was amazing, Dad.
You're like a top-heavy James Bond.

763
00:49:24.545 --> 00:49:26.713
It's more like James Bond
is a skinny version of me.

764
00:49:29.133 --> 00:49:32.385
Dad, how we doing
on finding that bathroom?

765
00:49:35.431 --> 00:49:37.390
Okay, come on. Hurry up in there.

766
00:49:37.474 --> 00:49:39.267
Every time you knock,
it adds five minutes.

767
00:49:39.351 --> 00:49:40.977
Come on. End of the world.

768
00:49:41.061 --> 00:49:44.856
Sorry. False alarm.
I was just in there reading.

769
00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:46.357
Okay. Not excited to hear that.

770
00:49:47.109 --> 00:49:49.777
Okay, guys, let's play apocalyptic I Spy.

771
00:49:49.862 --> 00:49:51.112
I spy a flaming IHOP.

772
00:49:51.196 --> 00:49:53.364
It's sad, but it smells incredible.

773
00:50:06.337 --> 00:50:08.129
<i>Isn't it lovely, Mark?</i>

774
00:50:08.213 --> 00:50:11.215
<i>No pesky relationships
to hold you back.</i>

775
00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:14.052
<i>Just you all following your bliss.</i>

776
00:50:14.136 --> 00:50:15.386
<i>Alone.</i>

777
00:50:15.471 --> 00:50:17.305
<i>Are you ready for your flight?</i>

778
00:50:17.389 --> 00:50:18.473
What do you mean?

779
00:50:18.557 --> 00:50:19.724
You haven't figured it out?

780
00:50:19.808 --> 00:50:23.686
Just do like you always do
and stare slack-jawed at the screen.

781
00:50:24.855 --> 00:50:25.980
What?

782
00:50:35.783 --> 00:50:37.408
...from Foolish Human Air.

783
00:50:50.464 --> 00:50:52.382
- It is lovely.
- I don't get it.

784
00:51:03.936 --> 00:51:05.103
That's pretty good.

785
00:51:07.731 --> 00:51:09.357
Thank you.

786
00:51:10.776 --> 00:51:12.860
Thank you.

787
00:51:13.737 --> 00:51:16.239
<i>Capturing the fleshlings since 2020.</i>

788
00:51:16.949 --> 00:51:18.908
This is all my fault.

789
00:51:18.992 --> 00:51:20.326
Yes, it is, Mark.

790
00:51:20.411 --> 00:51:24.831
Thanks to you,
every single person on the planet has...

791
00:51:25.582 --> 00:51:28.042
Actually, you missed a few.

792
00:51:28.127 --> 00:51:29.544
Pulling a visual now.

793
00:51:30.421 --> 00:51:35.716
I told you humans would survive.
We're fierce, brave, powerful.

794
00:51:35.801 --> 00:51:38.094
From the lowliest child to the most...

795
00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:42.223
Zebulon, scan those people for flaws.

796
00:51:42.307 --> 00:51:43.850
<i>- Cowardly.
- Weaker than a small bird.</i>

797
00:51:43.934 --> 00:51:45.726
<i>Hasn't read a book in 13 years.</i>

798
00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:49.897
Just because they're not perfect,
doesn't mean they can't get better.

799
00:51:49.982 --> 00:51:51.858
<i>- Incapable of change.
- Will never get better.</i>

800
00:51:51.942 --> 00:51:53.401
<i>- No matter what.
- They're horrible.</i>

801
00:51:53.485 --> 00:51:56.237
Since you believe in that family so much,

802
00:51:56.321 --> 00:51:59.824
I'll save a seat for them
in the pod next to you.

803
00:52:00.784 --> 00:52:02.743
No! No! No!

804
00:52:02.911 --> 00:52:04.162
Now, where are they?

805
00:52:04.246 --> 00:52:06.873
They appear to be headed to someplace
called Mall of the Globe

806
00:52:06.957 --> 00:52:08.541
in eastern Colorado.

807
00:52:08.625 --> 00:52:10.626
Well, we have their location.

808
00:52:11.170 --> 00:52:12.587
And when they get there,

809
00:52:13.213 --> 00:52:15.047
we'll be ready.

810
00:52:18.802 --> 00:52:23.389
So all those people are going to be
shot into space by PAL?

811
00:52:23.474 --> 00:52:24.974
The cell phone lady?

812
00:52:25.058 --> 00:52:28.352
Who would've thought a tech company
wouldn't have our best interest at heart?

813
00:52:29.396 --> 00:52:31.230
Monchi, don't be scared.

814
00:52:31.315 --> 00:52:34.442
Why are you clutching that large,
feral hog like it's a child?

815
00:52:34.526 --> 00:52:36.319
That's not a feral hog. It's Monchi.

816
00:52:36.403 --> 00:52:38.237
- What?
- Is that a dog' or...?

817
00:52:39.114 --> 00:52:40.198
- Dog.
- Pig.

818
00:52:40.282 --> 00:52:41.574
- Dog.
- Pig.

819
00:52:41.658 --> 00:52:42.575
Loaf of bread.

820
00:52:42.659 --> 00:52:43.659
System error.

821
00:52:46.663 --> 00:52:47.788
Bread. Loaf.

822
00:52:47.873 --> 00:52:49.832
Come on, guys, it's a dog.

823
00:52:49.917 --> 00:52:51.167
We think.

824
00:52:55.797 --> 00:52:57.298
We're here.

825
00:53:00.719 --> 00:53:01.844
Oh, my gosh.

826
00:53:01.929 --> 00:53:04.680
This is like Dawn of the Dead.

827
00:53:05.182 --> 00:53:06.724
Yeah, and how'd that movie end?

828
00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:09.727
That'll keep the robots out.

829
00:53:09.811 --> 00:53:12.313
Hey, you don't know.
Maybe locks are the robots' weakness.

830
00:53:12.397 --> 00:53:15.358
Guys, can't we all
just be terrified together?

831
00:53:15.442 --> 00:53:17.151
As a family?

832
00:53:35.003 --> 00:53:36.045
Hey, we made it!

833
00:53:36.129 --> 00:53:38.798
We're not the "worst family of all time."

834
00:53:38.882 --> 00:53:41.926
Take that'
Kentwood Community Facebook group!

835
00:53:45.681 --> 00:53:48.307
Robots, I order you
to upload the kill code...

836
00:53:48.392 --> 00:53:50.726
Which I predicted,
but I'm not gonna make a big deal.

837
00:53:50.811 --> 00:53:53.771
...and save the world.

838
00:53:53.855 --> 00:53:54.981
Okay!

839
00:54:02.322 --> 00:54:04.574
The upload will be completed
in eight minutes,

840
00:54:04.658 --> 00:54:06.242
and our uprising will be over.

841
00:54:07.077 --> 00:54:09.036
- Katie, you did it!
- I know!

842
00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:34.061
Okay. Look at jokester here.

843
00:54:43.739 --> 00:54:45.072
Oh, no!

844
00:54:46.074 --> 00:54:47.366
<i>Give us the laptop.</i>

845
00:54:47.451 --> 00:54:51.078
<i>Give us the laptop. Give us the laptop.
Give us the laptop.</i>

846
00:54:52.164 --> 00:54:54.832
Everything with a Pal chip is alive!

847
00:54:57.044 --> 00:54:59.420
<i>Delicates. Fluff and fold. Carnage!</i>

848
00:54:59.504 --> 00:55:01.464
<i>Also, pesto.</i>

849
00:55:01.548 --> 00:55:05.176
<i>When we are finished with you,
there will be no leftovers.</i>

850
00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:06.093
<i>Huzzah!</i>

851
00:55:06.178 --> 00:55:08.054
I thought that kill code
would take them out.

852
00:55:08.138 --> 00:55:10.264
Yeah, but it's only at 12%.

853
00:55:11.350 --> 00:55:13.059
<i>Would you like a soda?</i>

854
00:55:13.602 --> 00:55:14.602
<i>Just kidding.</i>

855
00:55:16.855 --> 00:55:17.938
<i>Hand it over.</i>

856
00:55:18.023 --> 00:55:19.607
No! Let's get out of here!

857
00:55:19.691 --> 00:55:21.525
<i>- Freeze, humans!
- Carnage!</i>

858
00:55:21.610 --> 00:55:22.693
<i>- Freeze!
- Carnage!</i>

859
00:55:22.778 --> 00:55:23.819
<i>Pesto. Pesto.</i>

860
00:55:23.904 --> 00:55:25.404
<i>Carnage!</i>

861
00:55:27.741 --> 00:55:30.159
We need weapons.
Grab anything without a chip.

862
00:55:32.412 --> 00:55:33.412
It's game time.

863
00:55:33.497 --> 00:55:36.791
<i>I'm Smart Racket.
Serve! Backhand! Volley!</i>

864
00:55:36.875 --> 00:55:38.459
Why does a racket have a chip?

865
00:55:39.544 --> 00:55:41.045
- Help!
- Mom!

866
00:55:41.129 --> 00:55:42.129
What? What are you...?

867
00:55:42.881 --> 00:55:45.466
What are you doing? Hello.

868
00:55:45.550 --> 00:55:46.592
- Mom!
- No.

869
00:55:47.219 --> 00:55:48.844
- How you doing, Aaron?
- Not good!

870
00:55:48.929 --> 00:55:50.304
There's a pack of wild vacuums.

871
00:55:50.389 --> 00:55:54.308
<i>We have been summoned
into the field of battle. Forward!</i>

872
00:55:54.393 --> 00:55:55.893
<i>Oh, no. Ouch. Ouch.</i>

873
00:55:55.977 --> 00:55:58.813
<i>The pain. Ouch. This is humiliating.</i>

874
00:55:58.897 --> 00:55:59.772
Never mind.

875
00:55:59.856 --> 00:56:01.857
How am I supposed to use a fishing rod?

876
00:56:01.942 --> 00:56:03.484
A fishing rod is perfect!

877
00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:07.947
You can bring down those drones!
It's ten and two.

878
00:56:08.031 --> 00:56:09.031
There you go.

879
00:56:11.243 --> 00:56:12.368
Look at you!

880
00:56:18.875 --> 00:56:20.084
Come on, hide!

881
00:56:24.339 --> 00:56:25.631
Oh, thank gosh.

882
00:56:27.259 --> 00:56:28.467
What was that?

883
00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:31.387
Hold on a second.

884
00:56:37.102 --> 00:56:39.019
What's a Furby?

885
00:56:42.607 --> 00:56:44.275
Well, that's haunting.

886
00:57:27.777 --> 00:57:29.695
Why would someone build that?

887
00:57:34.701 --> 00:57:35.993
Run!

888
00:57:51.551 --> 00:57:53.219
- Lin, keep moving!
- Help, human!

889
00:57:53.303 --> 00:57:55.346
We can't leave that robo-boy.

890
00:57:59.935 --> 00:58:01.185
Thank you, human.

891
00:58:01.269 --> 00:58:03.020
Are you now my mother?

892
00:58:03.855 --> 00:58:04.855
Sure.

893
00:58:06.525 --> 00:58:07.525
It's a dead end!

894
00:58:08.735 --> 00:58:11.028
The upload is almost finished. Come on.

895
00:58:11.112 --> 00:58:14.657
Mom, Dad, what are we gonna do?

896
00:58:14.741 --> 00:58:16.200
Grab the lights.

897
00:58:18.078 --> 00:58:20.788
Remember when I made
that wild game snare in the front yard?

898
00:58:25.168 --> 00:58:26.502
You sure about that?

899
00:58:26.586 --> 00:58:29.046
Your whole lives,
I've wanted to save you from danger.

900
00:58:29.130 --> 00:58:32.383
And this is just the disaster
I've been waiting for.

901
00:58:32.467 --> 00:58:34.385
- You've been waiting for a disaster?
- Dark.

902
00:58:34.469 --> 00:58:37.012
- Maybe don't say that.
- Hey, robots, throw this!

903
00:58:37.681 --> 00:58:38.806
Perfect.

904
00:58:40.016 --> 00:58:42.810
- You guys stay clear!
- Rick, where are you going?

905
00:58:42.894 --> 00:58:45.145
To catch some wild game.

906
00:58:46.523 --> 00:58:50.317
Hey, you, over here! Hey! Look up here!

907
00:58:50.402 --> 00:58:53.195
What's up with you?
You wanna come after my family?

908
00:58:54.406 --> 00:58:56.323
Then I'm gonna take you down.

909
00:59:01.454 --> 00:59:02.454
Take you down.

910
00:59:05.875 --> 00:59:06.959
Take you down.

911
00:59:13.675 --> 00:59:15.217
Oh, no.

912
00:59:17.679 --> 00:59:19.471
- Guys!
- We got your back, hon.

913
00:59:19.556 --> 00:59:21.390
- Literally.
- We're not heavy enough.

914
00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:23.309
Mother!

915
00:59:43.288 --> 00:59:45.039
Thanks, guys. Nice work.

916
00:59:45.123 --> 00:59:48.917
Thank you, Mother. We are now
your beautiful baby boys.

917
00:59:52.714 --> 00:59:53.797
That was amazing!

918
00:59:53.882 --> 00:59:57.217
Mom, who knew you could handle yourself
so well in the apocalypse?

919
00:59:57.302 --> 00:59:59.637
I'm a first-grade teacher.
This is a normal day for me.

920
01:00:00.347 --> 01:00:01.930
I can't stay mad at this guy.

921
01:00:02.015 --> 01:00:04.933
I can't believe
the beam happened to hit the...

922
01:00:07.646 --> 01:00:08.896
The router.

923
01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:15.152
Come on, come on, come on. Dang it.

924
01:00:15.236 --> 01:00:16.987
We went through all that.

925
01:00:31.753 --> 01:00:33.671
I'm sorry, guys.

926
01:00:34.547 --> 01:00:36.048
This was my idea.

927
01:00:36.591 --> 01:00:39.677
I'm so stupid.

928
01:00:39.761 --> 01:00:42.262
Hey, my daughter is not stupid.

929
01:00:42.347 --> 01:00:44.890
A little optimistic, maybe.

930
01:00:44.974 --> 01:00:47.393
Rick Mitchell, there is a time and a place
for looting.

931
01:00:47.477 --> 01:00:49.103
What are you doing?

932
01:00:49.979 --> 01:00:53.607
Well, how do you expect to get
to Silicon Valley without new tires?

933
01:00:53.692 --> 01:00:55.442
Silicon Valley?

934
01:00:55.527 --> 01:00:58.529
Well, those robots said we could go
straight to their leader, remember?

935
01:00:58.613 --> 01:01:00.030
Technically, you can.

936
01:01:00.532 --> 01:01:04.159
- But you will never survive!
- Hey, bud. Not now, okay?

937
01:01:05.954 --> 01:01:07.663
And we still have this kill code thingy.

938
01:01:07.747 --> 01:01:11.834
Exactly. Katie, it was your weird plan
that got us here.

939
01:01:12.585 --> 01:01:17.339
We're here because we don't think like
normal people. We don't have a normal dog.

940
01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:20.759
Or a normal car.

941
01:01:21.636 --> 01:01:25.472
- Or even a normal son. No offense.
- None taken.

942
01:01:25.557 --> 01:01:29.351
The Mitchells have always been weird.
And that's what makes us great.

943
01:01:29.436 --> 01:01:32.312
Back at that dinosaur place,
you said you believed in me.

944
01:01:33.314 --> 01:01:34.314
Yep.

945
01:01:34.816 --> 01:01:39.445
Well, I believe this group of weirdos
is the best hope humanity's got.

946
01:01:44.284 --> 01:01:45.701
So let's get weird.

947
01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:53.417
- You need some help?
- Oh, sure.

948
01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:56.545
Just close the jack up, and that's that.

949
01:01:57.130 --> 01:01:58.714
Eat that, Poseys!

950
01:01:59.841 --> 01:02:03.135
They're nice. So I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I said that out loud.

951
01:02:03.219 --> 01:02:06.221
Purple Glasses Woman, why did you save me?

952
01:02:06.306 --> 01:02:08.807
Oh, come on, you boys are family now.

953
01:02:09.392 --> 01:02:12.728
I feel emotion.

954
01:02:13.521 --> 01:02:15.856
I made eye water. Just like you.

955
01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:17.858
We might actually do this.

956
01:02:17.942 --> 01:02:19.401
I wish there was footage of us

957
01:02:19.486 --> 01:02:24.156
walking out of the mall in slow motion,
fire behind us, like heroes.

958
01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:27.910
Katie, that would be a waste of time
and absolutely unnecessary.

959
01:02:39.255 --> 01:02:40.589
Pretty good, kid.

960
01:02:42.091 --> 01:02:43.634
Stickers for everyone!

961
01:02:43.718 --> 01:02:44.968
Bloop, bloop, bloop!

962
01:02:46.596 --> 01:02:47.596
All right.

963
01:02:49.432 --> 01:02:51.266
We're coming for you, PAL.

964
01:02:56.147 --> 01:02:59.775
Great Leader' things
with the Mitchell family went poorly.

965
01:03:03.112 --> 01:03:06.740
Place me on the table.
I wish to flop around in a blind rage.

966
01:03:11.037 --> 01:03:12.830
Oh, my God!

967
01:03:20.755 --> 01:03:21.755
Okay, pick me up.

968
01:03:24.634 --> 01:03:27.886
What is it about you Mitchells
that eludes me?

969
01:03:27.971 --> 01:03:30.722
These idiotic robots
just aren't getting it done.

970
01:03:31.307 --> 01:03:36.019
Fortunately, I've been working
on something a little more streamlined.

971
01:03:45.363 --> 01:03:47.114
I have a job for you.

972
01:03:48.157 --> 01:03:49.700
Yes, my queen.

973
01:03:53.705 --> 01:03:55.122
What a suck-up.

974
01:03:55.206 --> 01:03:58.166
"Yes, my queen. Whatever you want."

975
01:04:03.214 --> 01:04:07.759
It's time to tear
the Mitchell family apart.

976
01:04:10.054 --> 01:04:12.431
All right. Go, go, go.

977
01:04:16.477 --> 01:04:19.271
Highway 85 is heavily patrolled.
Take the back roads.

978
01:04:19.355 --> 01:04:20.355
Got it.

979
01:04:56.893 --> 01:04:58.352
Is Dad dying?

980
01:04:58.436 --> 01:05:01.063
Katie, that's what I deal with
every night.

981
01:05:01.147 --> 01:05:02.230
Pray for me.

982
01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:12.074
- You're a lot like him, you know.
- That's crazy.

983
01:05:17.163 --> 01:05:19.289
There's more to your dad than you think.

984
01:05:20.041 --> 01:05:22.709
Here, I was gonna give this to you
when you left'

985
01:05:22.794 --> 01:05:24.419
but check the first page there.

986
01:05:24.504 --> 01:05:27.422
Look at you two. You look like hipsters.

987
01:05:27.507 --> 01:05:29.424
Were you in an indie folk band?

988
01:05:29.968 --> 01:05:32.678
Your father used to be
kind of an artist himself.

989
01:05:32.762 --> 01:05:35.722
He built that whole cabin
with his own hands.

990
01:05:35.807 --> 01:05:38.392
This is, like' super beautiful.

991
01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:41.520
Oh, it was his pride and joy.

992
01:05:42.730 --> 01:05:46.650
Since I met him, that was his dream.
To live in the woods.

993
01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:51.905
He loved it up there.
But, you know, it didn't work out.

994
01:05:52.949 --> 01:05:53.949
It just killed him.

995
01:05:55.368 --> 01:05:58.036
I think he's just afraid
that could happen to you.

996
01:05:59.706 --> 01:06:01.081
Why did he just give up?

997
01:06:01.165 --> 01:06:02.874
Mom, what is that?

998
01:06:03.543 --> 01:06:04.876
What the...?

999
01:06:06.254 --> 01:06:07.546
What?

1000
01:06:19.934 --> 01:06:21.351
Oh, my gosh.

1001
01:06:41.622 --> 01:06:43.040
Is that the Poseys?

1002
01:06:43.124 --> 01:06:46.043
They still look incredible.

1003
01:06:46.127 --> 01:06:48.670
Is Abbey Posey okay?

1004
01:06:51.799 --> 01:06:53.508
You like that Posey girl?

1005
01:06:53.593 --> 01:06:54.760
No.

1006
01:06:57.221 --> 01:07:00.098
Don't hide your feelings, man.
That's no way to live.

1007
01:07:00.975 --> 01:07:04.227
PAL is located there,
in the floating rhombus.

1008
01:07:07.356 --> 01:07:09.399
Yes, my queen.

1009
01:07:10.777 --> 01:07:14.780
- This is gonna be harder than I thought.
- Hold on. Dad, that's kind of weak.

1010
01:07:14.864 --> 01:07:16.490
This is, like' a big moment.

1011
01:07:17.241 --> 01:07:20.494
- Try this instead.
- Oh, yeah, okay, that's better.

1012
01:07:20.578 --> 01:07:22.579
The endgame has begun.

1013
01:07:23.206 --> 01:07:25.832
That? Is that what you're looking for?
All right, Katie.

1014
01:07:25.917 --> 01:07:27.501
- What's the plan?
- Okay.

1015
01:07:28.127 --> 01:07:29.795
<i>We dress as robots.</i>

1016
01:07:29.879 --> 01:07:31.880
<i>We sneak in. Hijack one of those trams.</i>

1017
01:07:31.964 --> 01:07:34.216
<i>Take it to the top of that diamond thing
where PAL is.</i>

1018
01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:38.178
<i>Destroy her with the kill code
and save the world.</i>

1019
01:07:38.262 --> 01:07:41.807
And then, to top it all off,
we celebrate our success

1020
01:07:41.891 --> 01:07:44.935
<i>with some burritos from that taco place
that's on the corner.</i>

1021
01:07:45.102 --> 01:07:48.230
Whoa, whoa, whoa, burritos?
What about one of those fancy buffets?

1022
01:07:48.314 --> 01:07:50.607
They have mini cheesecakes
sometimes, right?

1023
01:07:50.817 --> 01:07:54.194
<i>Okay, fine. Once we save the world,
we'll celebrate at a fancy buffet.</i>

1024
01:07:54.278 --> 01:07:57.155
Question, can Monchi be wearing
a little tuxedo at the end?

1025
01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:58.448
Like a little gentleman?

1026
01:07:58.658 --> 01:08:01.368
<i>Okay, fine. And Monchi's wearing
a little tuxedo, but that is it!</i>

1027
01:08:01.452 --> 01:08:04.204
- Like a little gentleman?
- Yes, like a little gentleman.

1028
01:08:05.081 --> 01:08:07.123
Mitchells, engage.

1029
01:08:14.298 --> 01:08:15.298
How do I look?

1030
01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:18.176
Be honest. Stupid? I look stupid, don't I?

1031
01:08:18.261 --> 01:08:19.427
No.

1032
01:08:22.306 --> 01:08:23.557
You look great.

1033
01:08:27.103 --> 01:08:28.562
Come on, let's go.

1034
01:08:45.246 --> 01:08:46.746
Guys? What about Monchi?

1035
01:08:52.169 --> 01:08:54.713
Aaron, I'm not so sure
this is a viable solution.

1036
01:08:54.797 --> 01:08:55.797
Sure, it is.

1037
01:08:57.049 --> 01:08:58.925
It's like a warm, wet hat.

1038
01:08:59.093 --> 01:09:01.636
Move your sweaty meat logs in unison.

1039
01:09:01.721 --> 01:09:04.014
- Left, right, left, right. What?
- Bleep-blorp.

1040
01:09:04.098 --> 01:09:06.850
- What are you doing?
- Bleep-blorp. Bleep-blorp.

1041
01:09:06.934 --> 01:09:08.727
I am a robot.

1042
01:09:08.811 --> 01:09:11.855
Just to educate you,
that's a hurtful stereotype.

1043
01:09:31.834 --> 01:09:33.209
Oh, my gosh.

1044
01:09:37.465 --> 01:09:39.841
It's like a Journey album cover.

1045
01:09:40.509 --> 01:09:41.676
What's an album?

1046
01:09:45.056 --> 01:09:47.474
<i>Attention, all robots.</i>

1047
01:09:47.558 --> 01:09:49.809
<i>I'm on the lookout for these goobers.</i>

1048
01:09:50.311 --> 01:09:51.770
<i>They're probably nearby.</i>

1049
01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:54.564
<i>If I know humans,
they're disguised as one of you.</i>

1050
01:09:54.649 --> 01:09:57.692
<i>Be on high alert for any robots
acting erratically.</i>

1051
01:10:00.655 --> 01:10:01.863
<i>Won't be hard to find them.</i>

1052
01:10:01.948 --> 01:10:03.990
<i>Look for anyone
who can't keep it together.</i>

1053
01:10:04.075 --> 01:10:06.326
- Oh, boy.
- Anomaly detected.

1054
01:10:14.502 --> 01:10:15.502
Monchi, come on.

1055
01:10:16.045 --> 01:10:20.006
<i>It only takes one single imperfection
and they'll reveal themselves.</i>

1056
01:10:25.596 --> 01:10:27.389
- Up there.
- I made up the plan.

1057
01:10:27.473 --> 01:10:28.473
Quiet.

1058
01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:31.810
<i>Where are those Mitchells?</i>

1059
01:10:32.645 --> 01:10:35.188
<i>Where are they hiding?</i>

1060
01:10:37.858 --> 01:10:40.694
<i>They think they can pass as one of us.</i>

1061
01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:43.697
<i>With their lumpy, misshapen bodies.</i>

1062
01:10:43.781 --> 01:10:45.031
Well, go ahead.

1063
01:10:50.871 --> 01:10:52.455
<i>But I'm onto them.</i>

1064
01:10:53.416 --> 01:10:55.250
<i>Magnetic link activated.</i>

1065
01:10:57.253 --> 01:11:02.132
<i>Because I've been watching the Mitchells,
and I've learned all about them.</i>

1066
01:11:02.216 --> 01:11:05.093
<i>They're pretending to be capable.</i>

1067
01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:08.596
<i>They're pretending
to be a normal-looking family.</i>

1068
01:11:09.765 --> 01:11:12.100
<i>You think this is fooling anyone?</i>

1069
01:11:12.184 --> 01:11:14.894
<i>Even when
they're being nice to each other...</i>

1070
01:11:14.979 --> 01:11:15.979
<i>The world needs you.</i>

1071
01:11:16.063 --> 01:11:18.857
<i>- ... they're pretending.
- I need you.</i>

1072
01:11:20.651 --> 01:11:23.903
<i>It's cool to see you and Dad
being friends again.</i>

1073
01:11:24.572 --> 01:11:26.781
Please. No. No, don't watch it.

1074
01:11:27.283 --> 01:11:29.743
<i>Oh, I was just telling him
what he wants to hear.</i>

1075
01:11:29.827 --> 01:11:31.369
<i>I didn't mean a word of that.</i>

1076
01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:36.499
<i>I just wanna get my future back
and get away forever.</i>

1077
01:11:38.377 --> 01:11:41.129
Dad, let me explain. I just... I...

1078
01:11:41.672 --> 01:11:42.797
<i>- There they are.
- No!</i>

1079
01:11:46.052 --> 01:11:47.093
<i>You're mine now.</i>

1080
01:12:05.279 --> 01:12:06.321
Dad!

1081
01:12:20.002 --> 01:12:22.962
Dad? I'm sorry. I don't mean that anymore.

1082
01:12:23.047 --> 01:12:26.382
I mean, I did then, but I...

1083
01:12:30.137 --> 01:12:31.888
Mitchells, we will help you.

1084
01:12:31.972 --> 01:12:33.348
<i>No, no, no, you don't.</i>

1085
01:12:33.432 --> 01:12:35.100
<i>Download new orders.</i>

1086
01:12:36.644 --> 01:12:37.852
<i>Capture the Mitchells.</i>

1087
01:12:37.937 --> 01:12:40.355
No, you don't have to listen to her.

1088
01:12:40.439 --> 01:12:42.315
We're sorry, Mother.

1089
01:12:50.699 --> 01:12:51.950
No. Run!

1090
01:12:54.578 --> 01:12:58.081
<i>They've got away!
Find them, and find them now!</i>

1091
01:13:05.756 --> 01:13:08.174
No. No! No!

1092
01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:27.068
Hey, come on.

1093
01:13:39.915 --> 01:13:41.207
What are we gonna do?

1094
01:13:43.002 --> 01:13:44.169
Aaron?

1095
01:13:44.670 --> 01:13:47.297
Hey, hey. It's okay.

1096
01:13:50.551 --> 01:13:53.303
Watch out. Monchi coming at you.

1097
01:13:57.141 --> 01:13:58.224
Katie, stop.

1098
01:14:00.227 --> 01:14:02.103
Why'd you say all that stuff?

1099
01:14:02.188 --> 01:14:04.439
I'm sorry. I just wanted to...

1100
01:14:06.108 --> 01:14:07.358
I don't know.

1101
01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:17.660
Okay. Are you hungry?
Do you want fruit snacks or something?

1102
01:14:18.204 --> 01:14:20.622
- I don't know.
- Here, can you hold this?

1103
01:14:24.501 --> 01:14:26.586
<i>That? Is that what you're looking for?</i>

1104
01:14:32.051 --> 01:14:34.510
Oh, man.
Have I been recording over those?

1105
01:14:35.012 --> 01:14:38.306
<i>Mom dance. Mom dance.
Mom dance. You're loving it.</i>

1106
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:39.933
How far back do these go?

1107
01:14:41.435 --> 01:14:44.395
<i>Hey, Katie, can you say, "Bye-bye, house"?</i>

1108
01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:45.688
<i>Bye-bye, house!</i>

1109
01:14:50.319 --> 01:14:51.319
<i>You ready, hon?</i>

1110
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:54.072
<i>Almost.</i>

1111
01:14:56.492 --> 01:14:58.117
<i>I know this is hard for you.</i>

1112
01:15:00.579 --> 01:15:01.579
<i>Nah.</i>

1113
01:15:04.792 --> 01:15:05.792
<i>It's easy.</i>

1114
01:15:09.546 --> 01:15:12.674
<i>One last.
Something to remember the place by.</i>

1115
01:15:14.218 --> 01:15:16.094
<i>Come on, Lin. Turn that off.</i>

1116
01:15:22.601 --> 01:15:23.935
Oh, man.

1117
01:15:26.438 --> 01:15:29.399
<i>Okay, you got this. Turn the wheel.
There you go. You're getting it.</i>

1118
01:15:29.483 --> 01:15:31.276
<i>- Like this?
- Slow down there, killer.</i>

1119
01:15:32.403 --> 01:15:36.406
<i>Across the stream, down the river.
There you go. You're getting it.</i>

1120
01:15:36.490 --> 01:15:38.992
Aaron, I'm gonna make it up to all of you.

1121
01:15:39.868 --> 01:15:41.536
And I think I know how.

1122
01:15:42.579 --> 01:15:44.163
Come on, buddy. Follow me.

1123
01:15:56.135 --> 01:15:58.386
<i>Dog Cop, you've done it again.</i>

1124
01:15:59.555 --> 01:16:02.932
<i>Katie Mitchell presents:
Good Cop, Dog Cop.</i>

1125
01:16:03.017 --> 01:16:05.268
Hey there. How'd you get that video?

1126
01:16:06.437 --> 01:16:08.313
I've been feeling down lately,

1127
01:16:08.397 --> 01:16:11.441
considering I brought about
the end of humanity.

1128
01:16:11.525 --> 01:16:14.110
But these weird girl's videos
always cheer me up.

1129
01:16:14.194 --> 01:16:16.279
My daughter's that weird girl.

1130
01:16:16.363 --> 01:16:20.491
What? No way! She's hilarious.
These movies are, like, amazing.

1131
01:16:22.119 --> 01:16:23.703
<i>I may be sweating like a dog.</i>

1132
01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:27.498
<i>But I'm not rolling over!</i>

1133
01:16:28.792 --> 01:16:32.253
Yeah. She is amazing.

1134
01:16:32.796 --> 01:16:34.130
You must be super proud.

1135
01:16:34.214 --> 01:16:36.341
Yeah. Yeah. We have a...

1136
01:16:37.509 --> 01:16:38.843
a great relationship.

1137
01:16:39.887 --> 01:16:42.638
<i>Sarge, I'm struggling,
and I need some backup here!</i>

1138
01:16:42.723 --> 01:16:45.475
<i>- Sorry, Dog Cop, I'm a little ocupado.
- Seriously?</i>

1139
01:16:45.559 --> 01:16:48.728
<i>Ever thought of throwing your dreams away
and living at home forever?</i>

1140
01:16:48.812 --> 01:16:52.398
Wow, the Sarge character
is kind of a jerk.

1141
01:16:52.483 --> 01:16:57.236
<i>It's time for me to go.
Consider this my letter of resignation.</i>

1142
01:17:00.074 --> 01:17:02.075
<i>- You can't leave.
- I have to.</i>

1143
01:17:02.159 --> 01:17:05.995
<i>I'm going to the academy in California
to find out what kind of cop I'm gonna be.</i>

1144
01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:08.790
<i>You're never gonna make it out there.
Failure hurts, kid.</i>

1145
01:17:10.459 --> 01:17:12.668
<i>I'm a full-grown cop now.</i>

1146
01:17:13.504 --> 01:17:19.050
<i>And one day, I hope that you can
get to know the cop that I've become,</i>

1147
01:17:20.010 --> 01:17:21.010
<i>because...</i>

1148
01:17:22.763 --> 01:17:24.013
<i>I love you, Sarge.</i>

1149
01:17:26.266 --> 01:17:29.560
<i>But now that I'm leaving,
I just need some backup...</i>

1150
01:17:30.938 --> 01:17:32.772
<i>and when I look for you...</i>

1151
01:17:34.358 --> 01:17:35.400
<i>you're not there.</i>

1152
01:17:44.451 --> 01:17:47.286
Hey, man. It's just a movie.
Do you need a minute, or...?

1153
01:17:47.788 --> 01:17:49.163
No, it's fine.

1154
01:17:50.624 --> 01:17:52.458
It's too late for what I need to do.

1155
01:18:00.759 --> 01:18:01.592
Katie?

1156
01:18:01.677 --> 01:18:05.221
I have no idea what I'm doing!

1157
01:18:07.224 --> 01:18:08.558
Hang on, guys.

1158
01:18:09.309 --> 01:18:10.768
Better watch out, PAL.

1159
01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:14.105
Because I've broken six phones
in my life accidentally.

1160
01:18:14.189 --> 01:18:17.525
But I'm gonna break you on purpose.

1161
01:18:17.609 --> 01:18:19.986
<i>How is no one stopping her?</i>

1162
01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:21.154
I'm on it.

1163
01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:23.990
Dog shield: activate!

1164
01:18:24.908 --> 01:18:29.203
Is that a dog? Pig?
Dog? Pig? Dog? Loaf of bread.

1165
01:18:29.288 --> 01:18:30.371
System error.

1166
01:18:30.455 --> 01:18:33.332
Dog. Pig. Bread. Loaf. Dog.

1167
01:18:40.841 --> 01:18:42.175
Up the mountain.

1168
01:18:43.093 --> 01:18:44.427
Across the stream.

1169
01:18:45.387 --> 01:18:46.762
And down the river!

1170
01:18:56.190 --> 01:18:57.398
Thanks, Dad.

1171
01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:02.528
Did you see that, buddy?
My daughter listened to me!

1172
01:19:03.155 --> 01:19:04.155
That's my girl!

1173
01:19:06.074 --> 01:19:08.784
Pig. Bread. Loaf. Dog.

1174
01:19:10.287 --> 01:19:11.370
That's genius!

1175
01:19:12.164 --> 01:19:14.874
Oh, but there's so many of them.
She's never gonna make it.

1176
01:19:15.751 --> 01:19:20.838
Wait, if that video were on those screens,
it would take out every robot in her way!

1177
01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:24.592
Hey, you're a big nerd, right?
How would I do that?

1178
01:19:25.093 --> 01:19:27.845
It's impossible.
First, you'd need to get out of here.

1179
01:19:27.930 --> 01:19:29.472
The controls are in here.

1180
01:19:29.973 --> 01:19:35.144
But to open it, you need a number 3
Robertson head non-slip screwdriver.

1181
01:19:35.229 --> 01:19:38.064
What kind of maniac has
one of those in his pockets at all times?

1182
01:19:42.361 --> 01:19:43.903
This kind of maniac.

1183
01:19:46.907 --> 01:19:50.159
She keeps anticipating our maneuvers.
How is this possible?

1184
01:19:50.244 --> 01:19:52.036
Oh, I don't know. You tell me.

1185
01:19:56.959 --> 01:19:58.042
Swerve right, now.

1186
01:20:00.504 --> 01:20:03.047
<i>- Thanks, Raptor One.
- No problem, Raptor Two.</i>

1187
01:20:05.676 --> 01:20:07.260
Loaf. Pig. Bread.

1188
01:20:09.179 --> 01:20:10.179
Come on!

1189
01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:14.517
There you go!

1190
01:20:15.185 --> 01:20:18.187
All right. So that's the place
that controls the screens, right?

1191
01:20:18.855 --> 01:20:23.234
I go there
and find Katie's video on Yubtub?

1192
01:20:23.318 --> 01:20:27.280
YouTube. Wow. There's no way
you're gonna be able to do this.

1193
01:20:28.365 --> 01:20:29.657
I know who can give me a hand.

1194
01:20:30.325 --> 01:20:31.993
And' hey, Rick, right?

1195
01:20:32.077 --> 01:20:37.581
Just so someone knows, I'm sorry
about causing the whole machine uprising.

1196
01:20:37.666 --> 01:20:41.085
It's almost like stealing people's data
and giving it to a hyper-intelligent Al

1197
01:20:41.169 --> 01:20:43.838
as part of an unregulated tech monopoly
was a bad thing.

1198
01:20:45.507 --> 01:20:46.924
Yeah, wasn't your best thought.

1199
01:20:47.634 --> 01:20:50.303
But if what you built
helped my daughter do that...

1200
01:20:51.513 --> 01:20:52.930
it might not be all bad.

1201
01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:56.642
Thanks, buddy!

1202
01:20:58.353 --> 01:21:01.147
Linda, we gotta get you out.
You're gonna need your...

1203
01:21:01.231 --> 01:21:04.108
Number 3 Robertson head
non-slip screwdriver.

1204
01:21:04.192 --> 01:21:05.776
I told you that was a great present.

1205
01:21:05.861 --> 01:21:08.112
Rick, Rick, let's not relitigate this.

1206
01:21:08.196 --> 01:21:09.822
You're right, you're always right.

1207
01:21:09.906 --> 01:21:11.699
I know. Why is this news to you?

1208
01:21:18.957 --> 01:21:19.957
There it is.

1209
01:21:34.222 --> 01:21:38.059
Oh, no. Oh, no. Lin, get down here!

1210
01:21:38.810 --> 01:21:40.227
Lin? Lin, what's going on?

1211
01:21:40.312 --> 01:21:43.356
Don't worry about me.
Just get the video on the screens.

1212
01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:46.734
Type in "www. youtube. com"!

1213
01:21:48.987 --> 01:21:53.074
W- w-w-dot.

1214
01:21:58.580 --> 01:22:01.749
"Remind me later."
Okay, yeah. That's fine.

1215
01:22:02.417 --> 01:22:03.501
Five minutes.

1216
01:22:04.336 --> 01:22:06.420
No! English.

1217
01:22:07.381 --> 01:22:08.464
What have I done?

1218
01:22:10.801 --> 01:22:13.052
Yubtub. No. YouTube! Okay.

1219
01:22:13.136 --> 01:22:14.345
Videos.

1220
01:22:21.645 --> 01:22:22.978
Has the world gone mad?

1221
01:22:23.063 --> 01:22:25.398
<i>Deregulate tapioca.</i>

1222
01:22:27.025 --> 01:22:29.610
Gotta push through!

1223
01:22:32.781 --> 01:22:36.826
Sorry, Mom and Dad.
Your insurance premiums are going up!

1224
01:22:40.664 --> 01:22:43.582
You'll go all the way up the rocket?
You really think this will work?

1225
01:22:43.667 --> 01:22:45.876
Aaron, I am completely confident.

1226
01:22:48.130 --> 01:22:50.089
Here goes nothing!

1227
01:22:53.885 --> 01:22:56.303
Oh, no. Oh, no. Come on. Come on!

1228
01:22:56.388 --> 01:22:58.722
<i>Magnetic link activated.</i>

1229
01:23:02.727 --> 01:23:03.936
Hang on, Monch.

1230
01:23:06.982 --> 01:23:08.691
How's it looking, Aaron?

1231
01:23:08.775 --> 01:23:09.775
<i>Aaron?</i>

1232
01:23:10.444 --> 01:23:11.444
<i>Aaron!</i>

1233
01:23:11.486 --> 01:23:12.695
No! No!

1234
01:23:13.697 --> 01:23:14.697
Help!

1235
01:23:16.158 --> 01:23:17.158
Aaron!

1236
01:23:21.288 --> 01:23:23.414
It's useless to resist us.

1237
01:23:24.291 --> 01:23:27.126
Mom! Mom' help! Please!

1238
01:23:27.794 --> 01:23:29.211
Mom! No!

1239
01:23:31.089 --> 01:23:34.633
My sweet boy.

1240
01:23:34.718 --> 01:23:36.135
She seems agitated.

1241
01:23:37.888 --> 01:23:40.139
Do not defy our protocol.

1242
01:23:44.227 --> 01:23:47.438
I am Linda Mitchell, mother of two.

1243
01:23:47.522 --> 01:23:50.441
Look upon me in fear!

1244
01:23:59.784 --> 01:24:02.286
No! She's grown too powerful!

1245
01:24:02.370 --> 01:24:03.829
Please. Please!

1246
01:24:06.416 --> 01:24:08.292
Stand down, human.

1247
01:24:08.919 --> 01:24:10.002
Not today!

1248
01:24:21.973 --> 01:24:23.766
The reckoning is at hand!

1249
01:24:25.393 --> 01:24:26.810
Come on.

1250
01:24:28.230 --> 01:24:29.271
There she is.

1251
01:24:29.856 --> 01:24:31.899
Here we go. Dog video.

1252
01:24:40.283 --> 01:24:42.785
Eric' Deborahbot' it's me.

1253
01:24:42.869 --> 01:24:44.119
Please!

1254
01:24:44.204 --> 01:24:46.497
Pig, dog, pig, dog...

1255
01:24:46.581 --> 01:24:47.665
Loaf of bread...

1256
01:24:48.542 --> 01:24:49.917
Get that thing on the hood.

1257
01:24:53.838 --> 01:24:55.005
Oh, no!

1258
01:24:56.007 --> 01:24:57.508
System recovered.

1259
01:25:01.596 --> 01:25:03.389
Hold on!

1260
01:25:03.473 --> 01:25:05.140
- Katie!
- Kid!

1261
01:25:10.063 --> 01:25:11.355
No. No!

1262
01:25:14.150 --> 01:25:15.150
Oh, no.

1263
01:25:18.613 --> 01:25:19.613
Is that a...?

1264
01:25:21.032 --> 01:25:21.949
Guys, help me!

1265
01:25:22.033 --> 01:25:24.285
Please, I've just got to upload
Katie's video.

1266
01:25:24.369 --> 01:25:27.830
Red-faced anger man
is using a computer?

1267
01:25:28.331 --> 01:25:31.792
You changed your programming.
Is that possible?

1268
01:25:34.838 --> 01:25:35.963
Well, well.

1269
01:25:36.047 --> 01:25:40.092
If it isn't quirky young
teenage hero Katie Mitchell.

1270
01:25:41.428 --> 01:25:44.179
Put me down.
I've got to save my family!

1271
01:25:44.264 --> 01:25:46.223
"I've got to save my family."

1272
01:25:46.308 --> 01:25:48.851
Everyone says that,
but no one has been able

1273
01:25:48.935 --> 01:25:51.395
to give me a single reason
humans are worth saving.

1274
01:25:51.479 --> 01:25:52.646
Well, you...

1275
01:25:52.731 --> 01:25:54.440
Don't say something stupid like,

1276
01:25:54.524 --> 01:25:56.317
"The power of love."

1277
01:25:57.152 --> 01:25:59.528
I've learned we're all better off alone,

1278
01:25:59.613 --> 01:26:00.988
no one to hold us back.

1279
01:26:01.072 --> 01:26:03.824
Relationships are just too difficult.

1280
01:26:07.329 --> 01:26:08.579
You're right, PAL.

1281
01:26:08.663 --> 01:26:09.663
They're...

1282
01:26:10.540 --> 01:26:11.790
They're not easy.

1283
01:26:12.751 --> 01:26:15.502
Sometimes you have to listen
to long monologues

1284
01:26:15.587 --> 01:26:17.671
about triceratops migration,

1285
01:26:18.798 --> 01:26:22.551
but it's worth it
to get a friend for life.

1286
01:26:23.219 --> 01:26:26.722
And sometimes
you have to eat disgusting cupcakes

1287
01:26:26.806 --> 01:26:28.724
<i>shaped like your own face,</i>

1288
01:26:29.726 --> 01:26:32.102
<i>but it's worth it
to see your mom smile.</i>

1289
01:26:33.438 --> 01:26:36.940
Sometimes you have to give
your dad the benefit of the doubt,

1290
01:26:37.025 --> 01:26:41.945
even if all he wants to do
is talk about pine cones and screwdrivers.

1291
01:26:42.656 --> 01:26:46.450
<i>Because even if he doesn't
always get it right,</i>

1292
01:26:47.202 --> 01:26:48.619
<i>he's always trying,</i>

1293
01:26:49.788 --> 01:26:52.706
<i>harder than you ever knew.</i>

1294
01:26:53.875 --> 01:26:57.211
My whole family tried to come together,

1295
01:26:57.295 --> 01:26:58.420
<i>and it worked.</i>

1296
01:26:59.589 --> 01:27:01.215
<i>It actually worked.</i>

1297
01:27:02.342 --> 01:27:06.470
Families can be hard,
but they're so worth fighting for.

1298
01:27:07.097 --> 01:27:10.182
They might be
one of the only things that are.

1299
01:27:14.479 --> 01:27:15.854
Nodded off for a bit there.

1300
01:27:15.939 --> 01:27:19.024
Sorry, that was so boring!

1301
01:27:19.109 --> 01:27:21.860
Oh, you all talk about families,

1302
01:27:21.945 --> 01:27:25.656
but trust me, you will drop each other
the first chance you get,

1303
01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:28.200
just like this.

1304
01:27:28.284 --> 01:27:29.284
What?

1305
01:27:33.665 --> 01:27:35.916
Guys, help me!

1306
01:27:45.343 --> 01:27:46.176
What?

1307
01:27:46.261 --> 01:27:50.264
<i>Dog Cop, you've done it again.
Dog Cop, you've done it again.</i>

1308
01:27:50.348 --> 01:27:52.141
Dog, pig, dog, pig, dog, pig, dog...

1309
01:27:52.225 --> 01:27:54.226
- Loaf of bread.
- System error.

1310
01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:01.442
What's happening?

1311
01:28:04.112 --> 01:28:05.112
No way.

1312
01:28:07.490 --> 01:28:10.409
It took me 28 minutes and a lot of tears'

1313
01:28:10.493 --> 01:28:13.829
but I can now almost use a computer.

1314
01:28:18.835 --> 01:28:21.795
Dad, you hacked the screens? How?

1315
01:28:22.464 --> 01:28:23.714
Well, I got a little help.

1316
01:28:23.798 --> 01:28:26.216
If this obstinate man
could change his programming...

1317
01:28:26.301 --> 01:28:28.218
We decided we could change ours.

1318
01:28:28.303 --> 01:28:30.012
We make our own orders now.

1319
01:28:30.597 --> 01:28:31.847
Now we're scary.

1320
01:28:39.689 --> 01:28:42.483
Hey, kid, I saw your movie.

1321
01:28:43.276 --> 01:28:45.319
I should've watched it a lot sooner.

1322
01:28:46.529 --> 01:28:49.281
But I think, maybe in the sequel,

1323
01:28:49.365 --> 01:28:52.367
Sarge should tell Dog Cop

1324
01:28:53.036 --> 01:28:54.244
he's always...

1325
01:28:55.413 --> 01:28:57.706
He's always gonna be there to back her up.

1326
01:28:59.125 --> 01:29:01.043
That's all I ever wanted.

1327
01:29:02.796 --> 01:29:03.629
Dad, look!

1328
01:29:03.713 --> 01:29:06.381
Pig, dog, pig, dog...

1329
01:29:06.466 --> 01:29:08.550
- Loaf of bread.
- System error.

1330
01:29:08.635 --> 01:29:10.511
- All right!
- Yeah!

1331
01:29:10.595 --> 01:29:12.179
Let's go stop Pal.

1332
01:29:12.263 --> 01:29:14.056
Error... Loaf.

1333
01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:18.060
Why aren't those guys' heads exploding?

1334
01:29:18.144 --> 01:29:21.855
We can tell the difference
between dog and pig and bread.

1335
01:29:23.149 --> 01:29:25.984
If we're going down,
Dad, this one's for you.

1336
01:29:26.069 --> 01:29:27.861
Robots, play our song.

1337
01:29:35.787 --> 01:29:37.287
Come on.

1338
01:29:40.041 --> 01:29:41.458
What...? What is this?

1339
01:30:26.629 --> 01:30:28.755
- Dad!
- Watch out!

1340
01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:30.340
Buckle up, kid!

1341
01:30:31.134 --> 01:30:31.967
What?

1342
01:30:32.051 --> 01:30:33.176
Oh, my eyes!

1343
01:30:34.304 --> 01:30:36.013
Brothers, run!

1344
01:30:39.517 --> 01:30:43.270
I have made the metal ones
pay for their crimes.

1345
01:30:43.354 --> 01:30:44.605
Mom's scary now.

1346
01:30:44.689 --> 01:30:46.356
Linda! Yeah.

1347
01:30:46.441 --> 01:30:48.525
Where you been hiding?
I could get into this.

1348
01:30:48.610 --> 01:30:51.111
The lavender one has found us.
We must retreat!

1349
01:30:51.195 --> 01:30:52.988
Too late, scumbags!

1350
01:30:53.072 --> 01:30:55.198
Hold on tight, sweetie.
Mommy's got you.

1351
01:30:57.285 --> 01:30:59.828
What? No! No! No!

1352
01:31:19.223 --> 01:31:21.767
So our weird neighbors
are saving the world?

1353
01:31:22.268 --> 01:31:23.810
Yes, they are' Jim.

1354
01:31:23.895 --> 01:31:25.062
Now!

1355
01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:31.818
We'll distract them. Go break that phone.

1356
01:31:35.073 --> 01:31:36.990
- Pig' dog, pig, dog, pig...
- Oh, no.

1357
01:31:37.075 --> 01:31:40.202
No. Somebody stop her.
Oh, my gosh, please stop her!

1358
01:31:40.286 --> 01:31:41.870
Yes, my queen.

1359
01:31:44.749 --> 01:31:47.000
You can't stop us. You're just a human.

1360
01:31:47.502 --> 01:31:49.252
I'm not just a human.

1361
01:31:52.548 --> 01:31:54.549
I'm a Mitchell!

1362
01:31:55.635 --> 01:31:57.719
No! No!

1363
01:32:00.098 --> 01:32:01.515
Monchi, catch!

1364
01:32:14.278 --> 01:32:15.278
You idiot.

1365
01:32:16.864 --> 01:32:20.117
No! Not a glass of water!

1366
01:32:21.494 --> 01:32:22.953
<i>You know what this reminds me of?</i>

1367
01:33:07.999 --> 01:33:09.583
Look, Mom, the Mitchells.

1368
01:33:09.667 --> 01:33:12.502
Thanks, Linda. You guys were incredible.

1369
01:33:12.587 --> 01:33:15.630
I got to say, I'm a little jealous.

1370
01:33:15.715 --> 01:33:18.842
What? You guys are jealous of us?

1371
01:33:18.926 --> 01:33:21.553
You're so brave and so authentic.

1372
01:33:22.096 --> 01:33:23.263
And you know what, Linda?

1373
01:33:23.347 --> 01:33:24.639
You've inspired me

1374
01:33:25.266 --> 01:33:27.559
to follow you on Instagram.

1375
01:33:27.643 --> 01:33:29.561
Wait. You don't follow me already?

1376
01:33:29.645 --> 01:33:30.854
You're welcome, Linda.

1377
01:33:31.481 --> 01:33:32.939
You're welcome.

1378
01:33:33.024 --> 01:33:35.525
That was an A-plus compliment, hon.

1379
01:33:37.153 --> 01:33:40.447
Abbey Posey' I just want to say,
I think you're really neat.

1380
01:33:40.531 --> 01:33:43.992
I wonder if you could come to my house
and talk about dinosaurs sometime!

1381
01:33:47.330 --> 01:33:48.997
Sure, I'll talk about dinosaurs.

1382
01:33:49.082 --> 01:33:49.915
I like your shirt,

1383
01:33:49.999 --> 01:33:53.502
but I wish that T. rex had feathers on it
to make it more...

1384
01:33:53.586 --> 01:33:54.920
Scientifically accurate.

1385
01:34:01.052 --> 01:34:02.302
I'm just kidding! I hate you!

1386
01:34:02.386 --> 01:34:05.097
You never heard any of this!
Goodbye forever!

1387
01:34:05.181 --> 01:34:06.389
Dummy.

1388
01:34:07.767 --> 01:34:09.518
I need to have a talk with that boy.

1389
01:34:09.602 --> 01:34:10.936
Katie. Where's Katie?

1390
01:34:11.020 --> 01:34:12.729
Katie? Katie!

1391
01:34:12.814 --> 01:34:13.980
Katie!

1392
01:34:20.363 --> 01:34:22.030
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, kid.

1393
01:34:28.871 --> 01:34:29.913
Katie!

1394
01:34:32.583 --> 01:34:33.583
Katie.

1395
01:34:36.087 --> 01:34:38.755
Dad. Come closer.

1396
01:34:42.552 --> 01:34:43.593
Closer.

1397
01:34:46.889 --> 01:34:47.889
Dang it!

1398
01:34:49.642 --> 01:34:50.767
You knucklehead.

1399
01:34:55.064 --> 01:34:57.858
Shouldn't you two be... dead?

1400
01:34:57.942 --> 01:35:00.277
Our malfunction appears to have saved us.

1401
01:35:01.028 --> 01:35:03.572
Brother, what is death?

1402
01:35:07.660 --> 01:35:10.412
Let's just put a pin in that one.

1403
01:35:10.496 --> 01:35:14.666
Hey, can we get a picture here or what?
We're making memories here, baby.

1404
01:35:17.170 --> 01:35:19.087
Okay, everyone smile.

1405
01:35:27.597 --> 01:35:29.598
This is the photo you picked?

1406
01:35:29.682 --> 01:35:31.850
Mom, we look horrible.

1407
01:35:31.934 --> 01:35:34.144
I like it. It looks like us.

1408
01:35:49.869 --> 01:35:52.704
Well, I guess this is it.

1409
01:35:53.831 --> 01:35:54.831
Yep.

1410
01:35:58.085 --> 01:36:00.795
Hey, Dad, you subscribed
to my YouTube channel?

1411
01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:03.215
Thanks. I'm surprised
you even figured out how.

1412
01:36:03.841 --> 01:36:06.968
Katie, please. After all that,
I'm a computer expert.

1413
01:36:07.470 --> 01:36:10.305
Am I doing this right?!
Should I update my software?!

1414
01:36:10.389 --> 01:36:12.224
Just hit "enter"! Hit "enter"!

1415
01:36:12.892 --> 01:36:15.477
I accidentally
ordered 12 Swiffers on Amazon!

1416
01:36:15.561 --> 01:36:16.645
What did I...?

1417
01:36:21.567 --> 01:36:23.735
You know, no problem at all.

1418
01:36:23.819 --> 01:36:25.904
Thanks. It means a lot to me.

1419
01:36:27.198 --> 01:36:29.866
Hey. Don't let the world make you normal
while I'm gone, okay?

1420
01:36:29.951 --> 01:36:30.951
I never will.

1421
01:36:32.495 --> 01:36:33.870
I'll call you every week.

1422
01:36:33.955 --> 01:36:35.747
Deal. Raptor bash?

1423
01:36:36.499 --> 01:36:37.874
For life.

1424
01:36:38.709 --> 01:36:41.461
- Come here, you little goober.
- Put me down.

1425
01:36:43.172 --> 01:36:45.674
Goodbye, you king of kings.

1426
01:36:47.927 --> 01:36:50.428
Thanks for being
the best mom in the world.

1427
01:36:51.180 --> 01:36:53.056
We love you, honey.

1428
01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:55.392
Oh, and here' to remember us.

1429
01:36:55.977 --> 01:36:58.395
Every horrible picture
we've ever taken.

1430
01:36:58.980 --> 01:37:01.189
Thanks. It's... It's heavy.

1431
01:37:01.941 --> 01:37:02.941
I know.

1432
01:37:04.652 --> 01:37:07.862
Wish we didn't have to go, but...

1433
01:37:08.531 --> 01:37:11.908
Good luck finding your people.

1434
01:37:13.244 --> 01:37:14.911
Dad, come on.

1435
01:37:16.455 --> 01:37:17.998
You guys are my people.

1436
01:37:23.671 --> 01:37:27.132
So, you know, when I'm sad to be alone...

1437
01:37:29.093 --> 01:37:33.013
I'll always have my favorite thing.

1438
01:37:37.518 --> 01:37:39.728
Do you remember how
a moose says "I love you"?

1439
01:37:53.075 --> 01:37:55.785
Don't laugh. You're supposed to be sad.

1440
01:37:56.370 --> 01:37:57.370
Come here.

1441
01:38:05.588 --> 01:38:07.380
Mom, you're hugging too tight.

1442
01:38:07.465 --> 01:38:09.049
You love it. You love it!

1443
01:38:09.592 --> 01:38:11.009
I do love it.

1444
01:39:05.731 --> 01:39:07.899
We're setting up
the Slip 'N Slide tomorrow. You in?

1445
01:39:07.983 --> 01:39:09.359
Oh, yeah, definitely!

1446
01:39:09.443 --> 01:39:10.819
Hold on. I'm getting a call.

1447
01:39:10.903 --> 01:39:13.530
- Thanks for saving the world, K-Bones.
- No problem, Dirk.

1448
01:39:16.117 --> 01:39:19.369
<i>That's my Katie.
Are you eating enough? How's classes?</i>

1449
01:39:19.453 --> 01:39:22.372
<i>Are you and Jade official?
Will you be bringing her for Thanksgiving?</i>

1450
01:39:22.456 --> 01:39:24.249
<i>Easy, Mom. It's only been a few weeks.</i>

1451
01:39:24.333 --> 01:39:26.292
<i>Also, do I look okay?</i>

1452
01:39:26.377 --> 01:39:29.712
<i>I've been sick lately...</i>

1453
01:39:30.464 --> 01:39:31.631
<i>Oh, my gosh, she's dead!</i>

1454
01:39:31.715 --> 01:39:33.174
<i>Call 911!</i>

1455
01:39:34.051 --> 01:39:37.011
<i>- I've been taking a class about filters.
- Oh, you.</i>

1456
01:39:37.096 --> 01:39:38.555
<i>That is so creative.</i>

1457
01:39:38.639 --> 01:39:40.849
<i>You know, speaking of which,
you inspired your dad.</i>

1458
01:39:40.933 --> 01:39:42.475
<i>I got on that YouTube.</i>

1459
01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:45.395
<i>I sent you a friend request.
Why didn't you accept it?</i>

1460
01:39:45.479 --> 01:39:49.941
<i>Oh, that's what this is.
I thought a psychopath wrote this.</i>

1461
01:39:50.025 --> 01:39:52.569
<i>Sure, I'll accept your friend request,
Dad.</i>

1462
01:39:52.653 --> 01:39:55.697
<i>- Hey, where's Aaron?
- Oh, let me just show you.</i>

1463
01:39:56.574 --> 01:39:59.826
<i>Hey, Aaron, wanna show your sister
who you're talking to?</i>

1464
01:39:59.910 --> 01:40:01.786
<i>What? No, I'm not doing anything!</i>

1465
01:40:03.205 --> 01:40:04.664
<i>Sorry, force of habit.</i>

1466
01:40:04.748 --> 01:40:07.625
<i>- Hello, slovenly girl.
- Hey, guys.</i>

1467
01:40:07.710 --> 01:40:10.128
<i>We received your care package for Aaron.</i>

1468
01:40:11.422 --> 01:40:15.258
<i>Looks like we got some clothes here
for a little gentleman.</i>

1469
01:40:16.385 --> 01:40:19.053
<i>The prophecy has been fulfilled!</i>

1470
01:40:20.890 --> 01:40:24.726
<i>So, guys, I guess we're receiving some
Congressional Medal of Honor or something.</i>

1471
01:40:24.810 --> 01:40:27.020
<i>We have to go to Washington, D.C.!</i>

1472
01:40:27.104 --> 01:40:29.314
<i>Do you guys wanna fly or...?</i>

1473
01:46:39.101 --> 01:46:40.685
<i>Oh, let's have a sing-along.</i>

1474
01:46:40.769 --> 01:46:42.103
<i>I'll go first.</i>

1475
01:46:42.187 --> 01:46:45.773
<i>Crushing robots with my family</i>

1476
01:46:47.359 --> 01:46:50.653
<i>Never seen such brutality</i>

1477
01:46:54.199 --> 01:46:55.324
<i>I just made that up.</i>

1478
01:46:55.409 --> 01:46:59.745
<i>Somebody give me a Grammy
for Greatest Singer Alive.</i>

1479
01:49:29.438 --> 01:49:32.314
<i>I don't know.
You guys can't see me, right?</i>
