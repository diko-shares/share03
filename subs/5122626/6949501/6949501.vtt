00:00:13.865 --> 00:00:16.600
(delicate music)

00:00:16.648 --> 00:00:19.402
Subtitles by explosiveskull

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.875
(moving orchestral music)

5
00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.318
(groaning)

6
00:02:17.054 --> 00:02:19.724
(breathing heavily)

7
00:02:19.757 --> 00:02:21.391
Where's Jotham?

8
00:02:22.026 --> 00:02:24.327
Calm yourself boy.

9
00:02:24.361 --> 00:02:25.428
You've had your turn.

10
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.398
He will join you presently.

11
00:02:28.431 --> 00:02:30.567
Why not kill us with
the rest of them?

12
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.570
When you catch a beast,
you hang it up to tan.

13
00:02:34.604 --> 00:02:36.741
Examples must be made.

14
00:02:36.774 --> 00:02:38.475
Get back here.

15
00:02:38.508 --> 00:02:39.342
Longinues!

16
00:02:40.044 --> 00:02:40.878
Longinus!

17
00:02:41.813 --> 00:02:44.916
(cell door rattling)

18
00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:54.125
(emotional orchestral music)

19
00:02:54.158 --> 00:02:56.493
(exhales)

20
00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:02.632
Dismas?

21
00:03:16.546 --> 00:03:17.581
Dismas?

22
00:03:18.916 --> 00:03:20.651
You look like an angel.

23
00:03:21.752 --> 00:03:23.386
Where are your brothers?

24
00:03:24.922 --> 00:03:25.923
Where are we?

25
00:03:27.158 --> 00:03:28.525
Shh...

26
00:03:28.558 --> 00:03:29.894
It's okay, mother.

27
00:03:29.927 --> 00:03:32.596
We're home, in the stable.

28
00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:34.866
You've been sleeping.

29
00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:36.701
Aram is right here.

30
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:40.671
And Jotham?

31
00:03:40.705 --> 00:03:43.540
He sat by your side all night.

32
00:03:43.573 --> 00:03:46.978
Oh my sweet boys, you
truly are my angels.

33
00:03:47.011 --> 00:03:48.713
(baby whines)

34
00:03:48.746 --> 00:03:49.981
Father should have been here.

35
00:03:50.014 --> 00:03:53.050
Your father will return to us.

36
00:03:53.084 --> 00:03:54.484
It's been months!

37
00:03:54.517 --> 00:03:58.622
Dismas, your father,
he's a good man.

38
00:03:58.656 --> 00:04:01.558
He may be a man,
but he isn't good.

39
00:04:01.591 --> 00:04:05.096
Jehovah would have you forgive.

40
00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:07.932
I will never forgive him.

41
00:04:07.965 --> 00:04:09.901
He left us.

42
00:04:09.934 --> 00:04:14.205
He left us to go get
drunk all the time.

43
00:04:14.238 --> 00:04:18.575
Not everyone
deserves forgiveness.

44
00:04:20.111 --> 00:04:22.545
(soft music)

45
00:04:32.757 --> 00:04:34.692
Let's try here.

46
00:04:43.633 --> 00:04:45.903
(knocking)

47
00:04:50.607 --> 00:04:51.208
What is it?

48
00:04:51.242 --> 00:04:52.743
Brother, tell me,

49
00:04:52.777 --> 00:04:54.812
do you have any
rooms for the night?

50
00:04:54.845 --> 00:04:55.947
(laughs)

51
00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.647
You are out of luck, my friend.

52
00:04:57.682 --> 00:04:59.684
We've been overbooked for days.

53
00:04:59.717 --> 00:05:01.018
It's the census!

54
00:05:01.052 --> 00:05:04.121
Sir, my wife, she is with child.

55
00:05:04.155 --> 00:05:05.923
She's about to give birth.

56
00:05:05.957 --> 00:05:06.924
Surely you can make some...

57
00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.159
Boy!

58
00:05:08.192 --> 00:05:10.962
There is no room for
you, or your wife.

59
00:05:10.995 --> 00:05:12.797
You will have to make
camp on the hillside

60
00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.699
with the other late arrivals.

61
00:05:16.633 --> 00:05:18.635
It's okay, God will provide.

62
00:05:19.602 --> 00:05:20.805
Sir!

63
00:05:20.838 --> 00:05:22.073
We have some room
in the stables.

64
00:05:22.106 --> 00:05:23.540
A stable?

65
00:05:23.573 --> 00:05:24.742
Yes sir.

66
00:05:24.775 --> 00:05:28.112
I tend the stable for Mister
Piram so he lets us stay there.

67
00:05:28.145 --> 00:05:30.181
You are very kind,
what is your name?

68
00:05:30.214 --> 00:05:31.048
Dismas.

69
00:05:35.653 --> 00:05:37.520
And this is my brother Jotham.

70
00:05:37.554 --> 00:05:38.521
Hello, Jotham.

71
00:05:38.555 --> 00:05:39.556
Hello.

72
00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:40.691
Joseph...

73
00:05:40.725 --> 00:05:41.759
There is not much time.

74
00:05:41.792 --> 00:05:43.060
We must hurry, you lead the way.

75
00:05:43.094 --> 00:05:46.864
(emotional orchestral music)

76
00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:54.939
Mother, this is Joseph and Mary.

77
00:05:54.972 --> 00:05:56.539
They had nowhere to go.

78
00:05:56.573 --> 00:05:58.075
I had to help them.

79
00:05:58.109 --> 00:05:59.777
She's going to have a baby.

80
00:06:00.845 --> 00:06:01.611
I can see.

81
00:06:02.847 --> 00:06:04.982
Of course we'll help.

82
00:06:05.016 --> 00:06:06.317
This is my mother.

83
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.552
She's unwell, but
can still help.

84
00:06:09.586 --> 00:06:11.122
(Mary breathes heavily)

85
00:06:11.155 --> 00:06:11.956
Are you sick?

86
00:06:13.657 --> 00:06:14.524
Nothing to fear.

87
00:06:14.557 --> 00:06:17.895
I had a child of my
own not too long ago.

88
00:06:17.928 --> 00:06:19.230
I have yet to fully recover.

89
00:06:19.263 --> 00:06:22.599
Your boy, Dismas,
he's a generous host.

90
00:06:22.632 --> 00:06:26.137
He's a good boy, my
blessing from Jehovah.

91
00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:30.141
Today, Serah, he is a
blessing to us as well.

92
00:06:31.709 --> 00:06:32.777
Oh!

93
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.246
(soft music)

94
00:06:37.348 --> 00:06:38.916
Bethlehem.

95
00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:40.617
The town of David.

96
00:06:40.651 --> 00:06:41.652
We have arrived.

97
00:06:43.154 --> 00:06:45.756
(gentle music)

98
00:06:46.957 --> 00:06:48.092
He's beautiful, Mary.

99
00:06:49.093 --> 00:06:49.927
He's perfect.

100
00:06:51.062 --> 00:06:52.629
What will you call him?

101
00:06:52.663 --> 00:06:54.597
His name is Yeshua.

102
00:06:55.699 --> 00:06:56.333
Yeshua.

103
00:06:57.634 --> 00:06:58.536
Salvation.

104
00:07:00.671 --> 00:07:01.305
It's lovely.

105
00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:04.708
(groans)

106
00:07:04.742 --> 00:07:07.044
Mother, go lie down.

107
00:07:07.078 --> 00:07:09.246
I can take care of our guests.

108
00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.184
Oh, you're so manly.

109
00:07:15.019 --> 00:07:16.353
Allow me to help you.

110
00:07:16.387 --> 00:07:19.156
It's the least I can do
to repay your kindness.

111
00:07:24.028 --> 00:07:24.862
Come on.

112
00:07:26.297 --> 00:07:27.665
Here is fine.

113
00:07:28.799 --> 00:07:32.203
Serah, may God's
grace abound to you

114
00:07:32.236 --> 00:07:34.271
for all you've done
for my family and me.

115
00:07:36.941 --> 00:07:38.876
Shalom.
Shalom.

116
00:07:43.714 --> 00:07:46.350
You have done so much
for us tonight, Dismas.

117
00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:49.687
I pray one day we can
repay you and your family

118
00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.722
if you are ever
in a time of need.

119
00:07:51.755 --> 00:07:55.092
Your father would be very
proud of you, Dismas.

120
00:07:56.093 --> 00:07:58.929
I don't speak of my father.

121
00:07:58.963 --> 00:08:00.131
Why?

122
00:08:00.164 --> 00:08:01.866
Why don't you speak
of your father?

123
00:08:01.899 --> 00:08:04.902
He was not a good man.

124
00:08:04.935 --> 00:08:07.138
All men fall short, Dismas.

125
00:08:07.171 --> 00:08:11.675
That's why we must depend
on Jehovah for forgiveness.

126
00:08:11.709 --> 00:08:14.311
You think everyone
deserves forgiveness?

127
00:08:14.345 --> 00:08:17.681
I don't think anyone
deserves forgiveness.

128
00:08:17.715 --> 00:08:19.783
That's why they
call it forgiveness.

129
00:08:19.817 --> 00:08:22.753
You and I, we need
forgiveness, too.

130
00:08:24.855 --> 00:08:26.957
(lowing)

131
00:08:28.125 --> 00:08:29.693
I'll see what's going on.

132
00:08:33.998 --> 00:08:35.399
Shalom.

133
00:08:35.432 --> 00:08:37.001
How may I help you, sirs?

134
00:08:37.034 --> 00:08:39.703
We are sorry to disturb
you at this hour.

135
00:08:39.737 --> 00:08:40.905
We are weary from our travel

136
00:08:40.938 --> 00:08:43.140
and would like to
rest for a few hours.

137
00:08:43.174 --> 00:08:45.075
Can you help us with our camels?

138
00:08:45.109 --> 00:08:45.910
There's no room.

139
00:08:45.943 --> 00:08:47.845
Yes, yes, yes.

140
00:08:47.878 --> 00:08:50.714
But we just need to rest
for a couple of hours.

141
00:08:50.748 --> 00:08:52.883
We have very important
things to do tomorrow.

142
00:08:52.917 --> 00:08:55.152
I'm sorry sirs, but we're full.

143
00:08:55.186 --> 00:08:56.387
Boy.

144
00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:58.889
It's too cold for
us to sleep outside.

145
00:08:58.923 --> 00:09:01.759
Kindly move your
animals, and we will...

146
00:09:02.493 --> 00:09:03.494
Melchior...

147
00:09:03.527 --> 00:09:05.362
(laughing)

148
00:09:05.396 --> 00:09:07.464
will pay you handsomely.

149
00:09:07.498 --> 00:09:08.999
It's not the animals, sir.

150
00:09:10.167 --> 00:09:12.102
A woman had a baby here tonight.

151
00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:16.740
(moving orchestral music)

152
00:09:16.774 --> 00:09:17.875
May we see this child?

153
00:09:26.517 --> 00:09:27.384
Could this be?

154
00:09:28.819 --> 00:09:30.487
We've traveled so far.

155
00:09:30.521 --> 00:09:35.726
I am Melchior, my friend
Balthazar and Gaspar.

156
00:09:36.527 --> 00:09:40.431
Am I a fool or is this
the foretold messiah?

157
00:09:40.464 --> 00:09:42.533
You are no fool.

158
00:09:42.566 --> 00:09:44.902
The birth of our son
was foretold to us

159
00:09:44.935 --> 00:09:46.737
by a messenger of Jehovah.

160
00:09:48.505 --> 00:09:51.809
Behold the King of Kings.

161
00:09:57.581 --> 00:09:59.016
What have you named him?

162
00:09:59.049 --> 00:09:59.883
Yeshua.

163
00:10:01.385 --> 00:10:04.154
(sheep bleating)

164
00:10:05.456 --> 00:10:07.391
We bring you gifts from afar.

165
00:10:08.926 --> 00:10:09.927
I bring you gold.

166
00:10:12.463 --> 00:10:16.033
A rare treasure for
such rare child.

167
00:10:17.468 --> 00:10:21.438
I bring you frankincense, a
gift for more than a king.

168
00:10:22.539 --> 00:10:24.541
A gift for a God.

169
00:10:25.943 --> 00:10:27.344
Behold.

170
00:10:27.378 --> 00:10:31.081
My gift to this
special child is myrrh.

171
00:10:31.115 --> 00:10:36.120
Treasured oil, holy, for the
anointing of kings and priests.

172
00:10:37.621 --> 00:10:39.823
(dramatic music)

173
00:10:39.857 --> 00:10:42.426
(horse neighs)

174
00:10:43.494 --> 00:10:44.328
Melchior!

175
00:10:44.361 --> 00:10:45.462
Matthias approaches!

176
00:10:51.869 --> 00:10:55.472
(breathing heavily)

177
00:10:55.506 --> 00:10:57.141
Herod lies!

178
00:10:57.174 --> 00:10:59.843
If we go back the way we
came, he will have you killed.

179
00:10:59.877 --> 00:11:00.978
You paid our homage?

180
00:11:01.011 --> 00:11:01.979
I did.

181
00:11:02.012 --> 00:11:03.180
You were most generous.

182
00:11:04.148 --> 00:11:07.084
But masters, Herod is insane.

183
00:11:07.117 --> 00:11:10.521
At one mention of the
prophecy, he flew into a rage.

184
00:11:10.554 --> 00:11:12.589
You are in great danger.

185
00:11:12.623 --> 00:11:14.258
As we feared.

186
00:11:14.291 --> 00:11:17.027
We have to go back home
from a different route.

187
00:11:17.061 --> 00:11:18.462
Quietly.

188
00:11:18.495 --> 00:11:21.332
Agreed, but what of the
infant Yeshua and his family?

189
00:11:21.365 --> 00:11:22.599
We cannot protect them.

190
00:11:22.633 --> 00:11:26.437
In fact, our constant
presence endangers them.

191
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:28.539
We must leave tonight.

192
00:11:28.572 --> 00:11:31.909
We must trust that God
will protect this family.

193
00:11:31.942 --> 00:11:33.377
There is nothing we can do.

194
00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:34.611
Rise, Mathias.

195
00:11:34.645 --> 00:11:36.380
Go back to the camp.

196
00:11:36.413 --> 00:11:38.415
Order the servants to pack.

197
00:11:38.449 --> 00:11:39.950
We will follow you shortly.

198
00:11:39.983 --> 00:11:41.085
As you command, sir.

199
00:11:45.356 --> 00:11:46.423
What is it?

200
00:11:46.457 --> 00:11:48.058
It is Herod.

201
00:11:48.092 --> 00:11:52.329
We must return home to
the east immediately.

202
00:11:52.363 --> 00:11:54.598
You are in danger as well.

203
00:11:56.133 --> 00:11:56.934
Please...

204
00:11:59.169 --> 00:12:00.037
protect the child.

205
00:12:01.271 --> 00:12:03.407
He is the best thing to
happen to this world.

206
00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.575
I will.

207
00:12:04.608 --> 00:12:06.110
Thank you.

208
00:12:06.143 --> 00:12:09.113
One day you will
understand the significance

209
00:12:09.146 --> 00:12:10.381
of what's happened here.

210
00:12:10.414 --> 00:12:11.683
Here.

211
00:12:11.716 --> 00:12:13.050
Take this.

212
00:12:13.083 --> 00:12:15.018
Use it to care for your family.

213
00:12:15.052 --> 00:12:16.487
Shalom, my brother.

214
00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:17.521
Shalom.

215
00:12:19.523 --> 00:12:21.024
Good morning, Jotham.

216
00:12:23.394 --> 00:12:24.228
Is it morning?

217
00:12:34.605 --> 00:12:36.173
How did we get here?

218
00:12:37.641 --> 00:12:38.475
That's easy.

219
00:12:40.043 --> 00:12:40.944
The Romans.

220
00:12:44.615 --> 00:12:46.550
The question is, how
do we get out of here?

221
00:12:51.555 --> 00:12:53.123
We're not getting out of here.

222
00:12:54.591 --> 00:12:56.627
(soft music)

223
00:12:56.661 --> 00:12:58.128
We need water.

224
00:12:58.162 --> 00:12:59.530
Can you show me to
the nearest well?

225
00:12:59.563 --> 00:13:00.564
I'll come too.

226
00:13:00.597 --> 00:13:03.033
No, you need to go to sleep.

227
00:13:03.066 --> 00:13:04.501
I want to come.

228
00:13:04.535 --> 00:13:05.335
Fine.

229
00:13:12.109 --> 00:13:13.076
I'm tired.

230
00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:14.311
I told you to stay and sleep.

231
00:13:14.344 --> 00:13:16.346
I know, but I wanted
to come with you.

232
00:13:18.081 --> 00:13:19.116
There it is.

233
00:13:19.149 --> 00:13:20.417
I'm going to walk Jotham back.

234
00:13:20.451 --> 00:13:23.253
All right, I will
take it from here.

235
00:13:23.287 --> 00:13:24.421
My foot hurts.

236
00:13:24.455 --> 00:13:26.490
Let me see.

237
00:13:41.505 --> 00:13:42.306
(booming)

238
00:13:42.339 --> 00:13:43.675
Do not be afraid.

239
00:13:43.708 --> 00:13:46.076
Messenger of Jehovah.

240
00:13:46.109 --> 00:13:47.578
Why do you return to me?

241
00:13:48.479 --> 00:13:50.380
I bring a message.

242
00:13:50.414 --> 00:13:53.417
Take the young child and his
mother and flee to Egypt.

243
00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:54.551
To Egypt?

244
00:13:55.519 --> 00:13:57.588
Herod is filled with fear.

245
00:13:57.621 --> 00:14:00.491
He knows for what purpose
the child was born.

246
00:14:00.524 --> 00:14:04.361
Even now he seeks out
the child to kill him.

247
00:14:04.394 --> 00:14:06.497
For how long must we go?

248
00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:08.232
Travel quietly.

249
00:14:08.265 --> 00:14:09.701
Tell no one.

250
00:14:09.734 --> 00:14:12.670
Remain there until I bring
word that it is safe.

251
00:14:12.704 --> 00:14:14.404
Follow the guiding of Jehovah.

252
00:14:15.239 --> 00:14:17.374
You will be protected.

253
00:14:17.407 --> 00:14:18.542
I will.

254
00:14:18.575 --> 00:14:19.610
I will.

255
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:26.650
That wasn't for us to see.

256
00:14:26.684 --> 00:14:27.584
Do you understand?

257
00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:29.654
Let's go.

258
00:14:33.725 --> 00:14:35.459
The arrogance!

259
00:14:35.492 --> 00:14:36.393
I want them found!

260
00:14:37.394 --> 00:14:40.197
I want the magi brought to
me so I can kill them myself!

261
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:43.233
How dare they defy me!

262
00:14:43.267 --> 00:14:44.501
Was I not a gracious host

263
00:14:44.535 --> 00:14:46.570
to allow them to
travel the kingdom?

264
00:14:46.603 --> 00:14:48.071
You were most
honorable, my Lord.

265
00:14:48.105 --> 00:14:50.708
Did I not accept
their measly tributes?

266
00:14:50.742 --> 00:14:51.608
Yes, you did.

267
00:14:52.509 --> 00:14:53.845
And I let them to
continue their journey.

268
00:14:53.878 --> 00:14:55.546
I endorsed them, even.

269
00:14:55.579 --> 00:14:58.415
And all I asked was for
them to return to me

270
00:14:58.448 --> 00:15:00.217
and report their findings.

271
00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:01.819
They betrayed you.

272
00:15:01.853 --> 00:15:05.222
Find them, and bring them to me.

273
00:15:05.255 --> 00:15:06.223
My Lord...

274
00:15:07.491 --> 00:15:09.426
There is something
far more dangerous

275
00:15:09.459 --> 00:15:12.262
than these three old men.

276
00:15:13.831 --> 00:15:15.465
This false prophecy.

277
00:15:17.534 --> 00:15:20.470
Let me go into Bethlehem
and find this child

278
00:15:20.504 --> 00:15:21.538
and bring him to you.

279
00:15:23.407 --> 00:15:28.145
We will show the people that
you are the wisest of them all.

280
00:15:29.914 --> 00:15:33.216
I am the wisest of men,
much wiser than the Magi.

281
00:15:36.453 --> 00:15:37.588
Let them go, Castor.

282
00:15:37.621 --> 00:15:39.489
They mean nothing to me.

283
00:15:40.825 --> 00:15:41.659
But...

284
00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:44.662
bring me back the child.

285
00:15:47.598 --> 00:15:48.532
Yes, my Lord.

286
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.803
I'll send my men now.

287
00:15:51.836 --> 00:15:52.670
Wait!

288
00:15:53.805 --> 00:15:54.638
Not yet, Castor.

289
00:15:56.908 --> 00:16:00.912
I'm growing weary of these
people and their prophets.

290
00:16:00.945 --> 00:16:04.247
They do not understand the
difficulty of being their king

291
00:16:04.281 --> 00:16:06.183
while Rome watches
over my every move.

292
00:16:07.919 --> 00:16:09.586
No, if I am to break the grasp

293
00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:11.488
the Jews and the
Romans have over me...

294
00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:15.392
I must crush this
delusion once and for all.

295
00:16:20.197 --> 00:16:21.632
I don't understand, my Lord.

296
00:16:22.265 --> 00:16:24.534
Send your men to Bethlehem.

297
00:16:25.535 --> 00:16:28.271
And kill every male child
under the age of two.

298
00:16:29.674 --> 00:16:30.942
The people will
finally understand

299
00:16:30.975 --> 00:16:33.678
the madness of
pursing this prophecy.

300
00:16:34.912 --> 00:16:37.347
By my lord, if I just
bring the child to you,

301
00:16:37.381 --> 00:16:38.281
it'll be enough...

302
00:16:38.315 --> 00:16:39.583
If we kill just the one child,

303
00:16:39.616 --> 00:16:41.485
what will stop the
people from simply saying

304
00:16:41.518 --> 00:16:43.620
that the messiah was
another boy in town?

305
00:16:43.655 --> 00:16:44.454
No.

306
00:16:44.488 --> 00:16:45.890
No, I will not have it.

307
00:16:45.923 --> 00:16:47.892
Every single one
of them, Castor.

308
00:16:47.925 --> 00:16:49.526
Do not miss even one.

309
00:16:51.495 --> 00:16:52.529
My lord.

310
00:16:53.597 --> 00:16:55.432
Castor...

311
00:16:55.465 --> 00:16:56.668
do not fail me.

312
00:16:58.602 --> 00:16:59.569
Yes, my lord.

313
00:17:00.437 --> 00:17:03.573
(emotional vocal music)

314
00:17:07.477 --> 00:17:09.613
(splashing)

315
00:17:23.895 --> 00:17:26.664
(horse neighs)

316
00:17:29.667 --> 00:17:32.536
(crowd chattering)

317
00:17:32.569 --> 00:17:35.305
(dramatic music)

318
00:17:44.648 --> 00:17:47.484
(children screaming)

319
00:17:47.517 --> 00:17:50.287
(crowd shouting)

320
00:19:19.911 --> 00:19:22.546
(baby cries)

321
00:19:23.748 --> 00:19:24.581
No!

322
00:19:26.383 --> 00:19:29.086
(mother screaming)

323
00:19:53.811 --> 00:19:54.611
Mother!

324
00:19:54.644 --> 00:19:55.680
Mother!

325
00:20:00.517 --> 00:20:01.585
My angel.

326
00:20:01.618 --> 00:20:02.954
What happened?

327
00:20:04.121 --> 00:20:06.389
They came for...

328
00:20:06.423 --> 00:20:07.058
Aram.

329
00:20:07.992 --> 00:20:09.593
Where's Jotham?

330
00:20:20.071 --> 00:20:23.107
We need to find
you help, mother!

331
00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:24.608
No.

332
00:20:24.641 --> 00:20:25.676
No.

333
00:20:26.711 --> 00:20:27.544
Run.

334
00:20:30.614 --> 00:20:33.684
Take your brother, and run.

335
00:20:36.053 --> 00:20:38.555
Go.

336
00:20:41.158 --> 00:20:41.959
Come on.

337
00:20:41.993 --> 00:20:43.127
We need to go.

338
00:20:48.666 --> 00:20:51.568
(dramatic music)

339
00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.542
What is the meaning
of this intrusion?

340
00:20:59.576 --> 00:21:01.611
Have you forgotten your manners?

341
00:21:01.645 --> 00:21:03.714
I need to speak
with you, my lord.

342
00:21:05.783 --> 00:21:08.418
(soft music)

343
00:21:10.154 --> 00:21:11.055
Leave us.

344
00:21:14.892 --> 00:21:15.993
Is the deed done?

345
00:21:17.527 --> 00:21:18.561
Yes.

346
00:21:20.164 --> 00:21:24.534
All the male children
in Bethlehem are dead.

347
00:21:25.269 --> 00:21:26.636
All of them?

348
00:21:27.738 --> 00:21:28.873
All of them.

349
00:21:28.906 --> 00:21:29.740
Good.

350
00:21:30.808 --> 00:21:34.111
And what of the Magi?

351
00:21:34.145 --> 00:21:36.747
I didn't see them in the
town, nor on the road.

352
00:21:39.283 --> 00:21:40.617
Treacherous fools.

353
00:21:41.385 --> 00:21:44.621
This business with the
Magi must be dealt with.

354
00:21:47.758 --> 00:21:49.492
Have your scouts found nothing?

355
00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.998
I though we were going to let
the Magi leave in disgrace.

356
00:21:54.031 --> 00:21:55.132
I've changed my mind.

357
00:21:55.166 --> 00:21:57.101
I want their heads, and I
want them brought to me now.

358
00:21:57.134 --> 00:21:58.468
They must be punished.

359
00:22:00.637 --> 00:22:03.573
Where do you think they
could have gone to, Castor?

360
00:22:03.606 --> 00:22:05.242
They probably fled
to the mountains.

361
00:22:05.276 --> 00:22:06.677
And are the king's scouts

362
00:22:06.711 --> 00:22:08.846
unable to enter the
king's mountains?

363
00:22:10.613 --> 00:22:13.516
The marauders own that land.

364
00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:16.120
If I sent my men in there,
they'll be at risk...

365
00:22:16.153 --> 00:22:17.288
You are mistaken.

366
00:22:17.321 --> 00:22:19.957
I own those lands and they
are my men to risk as I will.

367
00:22:21.192 --> 00:22:22.093
Find the Magi.

368
00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:27.865
My lord, their their
false messiah is dead.

369
00:22:28.833 --> 00:22:30.701
They hold no threat to you.

370
00:22:32.069 --> 00:22:34.005
Do you think me weak, Castor?

371
00:22:35.706 --> 00:22:36.639
No, my lord.

372
00:22:39.844 --> 00:22:40.978
Was I not clear?

373
00:22:42.179 --> 00:22:43.613
I ordered them to
report back to me

374
00:22:43.646 --> 00:22:45.182
when the child was found.

375
00:22:46.751 --> 00:22:47.650
Yes, my lord.

376
00:22:48.886 --> 00:22:50.721
They came to my lands...

377
00:22:52.156 --> 00:22:55.625
seeking a usurper to my
throne, and spat in my face.

378
00:22:57.128 --> 00:22:59.562
Their continued existence
is an affront to my rule.

379
00:22:59.596 --> 00:23:01.799
I would shed the blood
of a third of my kingdom

380
00:23:01.832 --> 00:23:03.667
rather than suffer
it a day longer!

381
00:23:07.204 --> 00:23:08.571
Find them!

382
00:23:08.605 --> 00:23:11.742
(troubling music)

383
00:23:44.842 --> 00:23:46.377
Dismas, my son.

384
00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:48.979
Look at the desert lily.

385
00:23:49.013 --> 00:23:50.114
See it?

386
00:23:50.147 --> 00:23:52.683
It grows in the harshest
places on Earth,

387
00:23:52.716 --> 00:23:55.820
under the hot sun, where
there are no streams,

388
00:23:55.853 --> 00:23:59.356
no rivers, no hope
for living things.

389
00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:04.361
Where other plants wither,
Jehovah provides a way,

390
00:24:05.296 --> 00:24:09.867
and so it survives,
and in time, it blooms.

391
00:24:12.436 --> 00:24:16.006
(cell door clanks)

392
00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:18.275
Of all the ways to go...

393
00:24:20.277 --> 00:24:23.380
I would never have known you
two would be the end of me.

394
00:24:23.414 --> 00:24:25.648
You should have
left us alone, Abba.

395
00:24:25.683 --> 00:24:28.285
You shouldn't have
put up a fight.

396
00:24:28.319 --> 00:24:30.187
Tiran was right no
to to trust you.

397
00:24:31.188 --> 00:24:35.659
I thought maybe you'd
gain some wisdom with age,

398
00:24:35.693 --> 00:24:37.928
but you're just as
bad as when I met you.

399
00:24:39.763 --> 00:24:43.367
No, I am worse than
when you met me.

400
00:24:48.139 --> 00:24:48.973
Stand.

401
00:24:51.909 --> 00:24:53.444
Who are you?

402
00:24:53.477 --> 00:24:55.212
I'm Dismas.

403
00:24:55.246 --> 00:24:56.714
Dismas.

404
00:24:56.747 --> 00:24:59.083
And how did Dismas
come to be out here

405
00:24:59.116 --> 00:25:00.384
in the middle of nowhere?

406
00:25:02.219 --> 00:25:04.255
Are you aware that
you're trespassing, boy?

407
00:25:04.288 --> 00:25:05.189
How?

408
00:25:05.222 --> 00:25:06.957
This is the middle of nowhere.

409
00:25:06.991 --> 00:25:08.993
The middle of nowhere.

410
00:25:15.166 --> 00:25:16.000
I'm Tiran.

411
00:25:17.301 --> 00:25:18.169
These are my men.

412
00:25:19.036 --> 00:25:20.137
This is my desert.

413
00:25:21.005 --> 00:25:23.240
Are you traders?

414
00:25:23.274 --> 00:25:24.341
We're distributors.

415
00:25:25.342 --> 00:25:28.479
We re-distribute wealth
among fellow travelers.

416
00:25:28.512 --> 00:25:30.447
Oh.

417
00:25:30.481 --> 00:25:32.283
You understand what that means?

418
00:25:33.217 --> 00:25:34.385
It means...

419
00:25:35.286 --> 00:25:36.754
you're thieves!

420
00:25:37.521 --> 00:25:39.456
Look at every one
of their faces, boy.

421
00:25:40.758 --> 00:25:41.725
These men here

422
00:25:42.661 --> 00:25:44.395
are from every far flung
corner of the world,

423
00:25:44.428 --> 00:25:47.765
including my boy, Gestas, who
grew up in the Mediterranean.

424
00:25:48.532 --> 00:25:50.000
Their left their
past lives behind

425
00:25:50.034 --> 00:25:51.335
to make a better one here.

426
00:25:52.403 --> 00:25:53.771
You seem like a smart boy

427
00:25:53.804 --> 00:25:55.739
despite getting
lost in the desert.

428
00:25:55.773 --> 00:25:57.975
So surely you realize
who the true thieves are?

429
00:25:58.008 --> 00:26:01.011
The rich, who make a fortunes
off the back of slaves,

430
00:26:01.045 --> 00:26:04.882
the tax collectors who
pad their books with gold.

431
00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:07.851
Gold like this.

432
00:26:10.387 --> 00:26:15.226
Where does a desert rat like
you get a coin like this?

433
00:26:15.259 --> 00:26:17.962
(tense music)

434
00:26:17.995 --> 00:26:18.829
I found it.

435
00:26:20.297 --> 00:26:21.131
You're a liar.

436
00:26:22.299 --> 00:26:24.835
Oh, I hate doing this.

437
00:26:24.868 --> 00:26:26.403
Abba, the little one!

438
00:26:26.437 --> 00:26:27.438
Stop!

439
00:26:27.471 --> 00:26:28.372
Don't hurt him!

440
00:26:28.405 --> 00:26:29.840
I'll tell you how I got it!

441
00:26:29.873 --> 00:26:31.008
That's adorable.

442
00:26:31.041 --> 00:26:32.476
But if the next words
out of his mouth

443
00:26:32.509 --> 00:26:34.378
aren't exactly where
he got that coin,

444
00:26:34.411 --> 00:26:36.780
slit his delicate throat.

445
00:26:36.814 --> 00:26:38.249
Speak, rat.

446
00:26:38.282 --> 00:26:39.383
I stole it!

447
00:26:39.416 --> 00:26:41.785
We almost got caught, and
that's why we're out here.

448
00:26:41.819 --> 00:26:44.255
Now, please, let my brother go!

449
00:26:46.457 --> 00:26:48.492
It takes on thief to
know another, huh?

450
00:26:50.861 --> 00:26:54.265
You lifted a coin like this
without getting caught?

451
00:26:54.298 --> 00:26:56.433
Can no one else be
thieves but you?

452
00:26:58.302 --> 00:27:00.471
I'd like to meet the man
that owned this coin.

453
00:27:00.504 --> 00:27:03.140
I'd imagine there's a lot
more where this came from.

454
00:27:03.173 --> 00:27:04.475
Wouldn't you?

455
00:27:04.508 --> 00:27:06.277
Maybe.

456
00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:07.311
Maybe?

457
00:27:07.344 --> 00:27:08.379
How about this, boy?

458
00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:10.481
You take me to this man,

459
00:27:11.215 --> 00:27:13.817
and I won't cut your
hands off for thieving?

460
00:27:16.086 --> 00:27:16.920
Rat.

461
00:27:21.492 --> 00:27:24.461
(dramatic percussion)

462
00:27:30.934 --> 00:27:33.370
The Magi had lots of guards.

463
00:27:33.404 --> 00:27:34.538
They'll protect us.

464
00:27:34.571 --> 00:27:37.374
These raiders don't
stand a chance.

465
00:27:37.408 --> 00:27:38.609
Are you sure?

466
00:27:38.642 --> 00:27:39.543
Yes.

467
00:27:39.576 --> 00:27:40.978
Well...

468
00:27:41.011 --> 00:27:41.845
pretty sure.

469
00:27:43.013 --> 00:27:44.348
I'm scared.

470
00:27:44.381 --> 00:27:46.250
I know, I am too.

471
00:27:47.418 --> 00:27:48.385
You are?

472
00:27:48.419 --> 00:27:50.854
Yes, but we have to be brave.

473
00:27:50.888 --> 00:27:52.189
Can you be brave with me?

474
00:27:53.524 --> 00:27:54.525
Yes.

475
00:27:54.558 --> 00:27:56.527
I can if you can.

476
00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:57.461
Good.

477
00:27:57.494 --> 00:27:58.529
Then do everything I say.

478
00:27:59.664 --> 00:28:00.564
It's Thomas.

479
00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:04.601
Thomas.

480
00:28:04.635 --> 00:28:06.470
Come on, Gestas.

481
00:28:06.503 --> 00:28:08.238
Give me good news, Thomas.

482
00:28:08.272 --> 00:28:10.441
There's a large
caravan, all right.

483
00:28:10.474 --> 00:28:12.609
Little rat is telling the truth.

484
00:28:12.643 --> 00:28:14.578
They have dozens of soldiers.

485
00:28:14.611 --> 00:28:17.247
They work in shifts
into the night.

486
00:28:17.281 --> 00:28:19.983
Either they're scared, or
they have a lot to protect.

487
00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:24.488
Follow them 'til they
make camp for the night,

488
00:28:24.521 --> 00:28:25.522
then circle back.

489
00:28:26.523 --> 00:28:28.058
We'll attack them by surprise.

490
00:28:28.092 --> 00:28:28.892
Yes, sir.

491
00:28:28.926 --> 00:28:30.494
Take Gestas with you.

492
00:28:30.527 --> 00:28:31.663
It's time this little
scoundrel learned

493
00:28:31.696 --> 00:28:33.464
how to scout a camp properly.

494
00:28:33.497 --> 00:28:35.933
(man laughs)

495
00:28:41.271 --> 00:28:43.207
I'll keep him safe.

496
00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.074
Safe?

497
00:28:45.476 --> 00:28:47.411
How's he supposed to learn
anything if he's safe?

498
00:28:47.444 --> 00:28:50.547
(man laughs)

499
00:28:50.581 --> 00:28:53.584
(suspenseful music)

500
00:29:30.053 --> 00:29:32.122
(grunts)

501
00:29:39.029 --> 00:29:39.664
Where is it?

502
00:29:41.265 --> 00:29:42.065
That is it.

503
00:29:42.099 --> 00:29:43.467
That is all we have.

504
00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:45.102
That's all you have?

505
00:29:45.135 --> 00:29:47.504
Is that why you have
a tent fit for a queen

506
00:29:47.538 --> 00:29:51.108
and an entire pack of guards
looking after your back?

507
00:29:51.141 --> 00:29:54.111
We are just simple travelers
traveling through this...

508
00:29:54.144 --> 00:29:55.245
(grunts)

509
00:29:55.279 --> 00:29:57.448
I know exactly who you are
and where you've traveled.

510
00:29:57.481 --> 00:29:59.550
Your friends here
already shared that.

511
00:29:59.583 --> 00:30:02.119
Now, I'm going to ask
you one more time, Magi.

512
00:30:02.152 --> 00:30:03.420
Where's the rest of it?

513
00:30:03.454 --> 00:30:05.289
You are correct.

514
00:30:05.322 --> 00:30:07.991
We are Magi.

515
00:30:08.025 --> 00:30:10.127
But there's no more riches.

516
00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:12.697
(dramatic music)

517
00:30:14.498 --> 00:30:15.499
Stop!

518
00:30:15.532 --> 00:30:16.400
Please.

519
00:30:16.433 --> 00:30:18.335
I'll tell you everything
you want to hear.

520
00:30:18.368 --> 00:30:20.504
Finally there's
a smart man here!

521
00:30:20.537 --> 00:30:22.406
Please, enlighten me.

522
00:30:22.439 --> 00:30:25.609
When we crossed the border
into Herod's territory,

523
00:30:25.642 --> 00:30:30.414
his men came to us and demanded
that we pay Herod's toll.

524
00:30:30.447 --> 00:30:33.751
His man Castor
threatened to execute us.

525
00:30:33.785 --> 00:30:34.618
Castor.

526
00:30:35.753 --> 00:30:38.255
That wonderful occupier.

527
00:30:38.288 --> 00:30:40.224
To whom we are the resistance.

528
00:30:40.257 --> 00:30:42.493
I've crossed paths
with Castor before.

529
00:30:42.526 --> 00:30:43.427
Yes.

530
00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:47.331
So, we paid quite a
large amount as tribute,

531
00:30:47.364 --> 00:30:50.200
hoping that this would all
be over, but it wasn't.

532
00:30:50.234 --> 00:30:53.337
Castor's men came back and
robbed us of the rest of it.

533
00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:55.239
We made haste to the east,

534
00:30:55.272 --> 00:30:57.474
trying to escape from
being robbed anymore.

535
00:30:58.542 --> 00:31:02.012
But the, well, um, you...

536
00:31:03.113 --> 00:31:04.214
robbed us.

537
00:31:04.248 --> 00:31:05.516
I haven't robbed you yet,
because you won't tell me

538
00:31:05.549 --> 00:31:07.284
where the rest of it is.

539
00:31:07.317 --> 00:31:08.218
Dismas!

540
00:31:08.252 --> 00:31:09.052
Come here.

541
00:31:10.755 --> 00:31:12.322
Do you know these men?

542
00:31:12.356 --> 00:31:14.291
I cared for their
livestock a few days ago.

543
00:31:14.324 --> 00:31:16.460
Is this the rat you
caught stealing?

544
00:31:16.493 --> 00:31:19.062
I beg your pardon,
almost caught.

545
00:31:20.798 --> 00:31:21.699
Of course.

546
00:31:21.733 --> 00:31:23.600
We thought he had escaped.

547
00:31:23.634 --> 00:31:26.603
I don't suppose you would let
us keep him and his brother

548
00:31:26.637 --> 00:31:28.071
so that they may be punished?

549
00:31:28.105 --> 00:31:29.339
No.

550
00:31:29.373 --> 00:31:30.742
I'm growing quite fond
of the little vermin.

551
00:31:30.775 --> 00:31:32.609
In fact, I think
we'll keep them.

552
00:31:32.643 --> 00:31:34.545
As for you three...
(sword clangs)

553
00:31:34.578 --> 00:31:36.513
(dramatic music)

554
00:31:36.547 --> 00:31:37.447
(Dismas grunts)

555
00:31:37.481 --> 00:31:40.617
Drop your weapons now,
or I kill the boy.

556
00:31:40.651 --> 00:31:42.319
(chuckles)

557
00:31:42.352 --> 00:31:46.089
This must be the incredibly
simple Magi. (chuckles)

558
00:31:46.123 --> 00:31:47.324
You want to do it?

559
00:31:47.357 --> 00:31:48.292
Kill him.

560
00:31:48.325 --> 00:31:49.626
Mathias, let the boy go!

561
00:31:51.562 --> 00:31:52.730
I will do it!

562
00:31:52.764 --> 00:31:55.265
I will slit his throat!

563
00:31:55.299 --> 00:31:56.868
Release my masters now!

564
00:31:56.901 --> 00:31:57.702
Let him go!

565
00:31:57.735 --> 00:31:58.535
Don't harm him!

566
00:31:58.569 --> 00:32:00.137
Stand down, Abba.

567
00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:00.805
Let him kill him.

568
00:32:00.838 --> 00:32:02.740
Let my brother go!

569
00:32:02.774 --> 00:32:05.609
(Matthias grunts)

570
00:32:07.544 --> 00:32:10.147
You are pathetic, sir.

571
00:32:11.582 --> 00:32:13.517
I believe you were just
disarmed by a little boy.

572
00:32:15.452 --> 00:32:17.588
Stupid and incompetent.

573
00:32:17.621 --> 00:32:19.757
Two very unfortunate qualities.

574
00:32:21.391 --> 00:32:23.728
This is who you pick to be
the captain of your guard?

575
00:32:24.929 --> 00:32:26.798
I thought Magi were
supposed to be wise.

576
00:32:29.366 --> 00:32:30.534
Dismas.

577
00:32:30.567 --> 00:32:31.568
Come here.

578
00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:35.172
You see that man over there?

579
00:32:35.205 --> 00:32:36.774
The one we're holding?

580
00:32:36.808 --> 00:32:38.642
He was going to kill you.

581
00:32:38.676 --> 00:32:41.211
He was going to
slit your throat.

582
00:32:41.244 --> 00:32:43.447
And now you're
going to kill him.

583
00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:44.514
Take this sword.

584
00:32:44.548 --> 00:32:46.516
(tense music)

585
00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:47.351
I can't.

586
00:32:47.384 --> 00:32:48.452
Yes you can!

587
00:32:48.485 --> 00:32:50.354
Thomas will hold him for you.

588
00:32:50.387 --> 00:32:51.321
I won't!

589
00:32:51.355 --> 00:32:52.589
Yes you will!

590
00:32:52.623 --> 00:32:53.624
Or Abba will take
your brother's life!

591
00:32:53.658 --> 00:32:54.491
No!

592
00:32:54.524 --> 00:32:55.525
Stop!

593
00:32:55.559 --> 00:32:56.526
You stop.

594
00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:57.795
You stop.

595
00:32:57.829 --> 00:32:59.363
You're the only
who can stop this.

596
00:32:59.396 --> 00:33:01.398
You're the one who
determines what happens here.

597
00:33:01.431 --> 00:33:03.333
He was about to
slit your throat.

598
00:33:03.367 --> 00:33:04.201
Do yo understand?

599
00:33:05.469 --> 00:33:06.738
Do it.

600
00:33:06.771 --> 00:33:08.205
Are you a coward?
No.

601
00:33:08.238 --> 00:33:09.272
Then what are you waiting for?

602
00:33:09.306 --> 00:33:10.173
Do it!

603
00:33:10.207 --> 00:33:13.410
Now!

604
00:33:13.443 --> 00:33:15.612
(screams)

605
00:33:24.956 --> 00:33:27.491
Ladies, here are your spoils.

606
00:33:27.524 --> 00:33:28.525
Share them accordingly.

607
00:33:29.927 --> 00:33:31.461
Who's the one responsible
for tying the poor man

608
00:33:31.495 --> 00:33:33.430
that got himself
killed last night?

609
00:33:34.699 --> 00:33:36.701
I am, sir.

610
00:33:36.734 --> 00:33:37.567
Thomas.

611
00:33:39.737 --> 00:33:40.604
(sighs)

612
00:33:40.637 --> 00:33:42.372
Oh, no.

613
00:33:42.406 --> 00:33:44.809
You need to learn to tie
better knots, old man.

614
00:33:44.842 --> 00:33:46.476
(chuckling)

615
00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:48.378
You almost got Dismas
killed on his first raid.

616
00:33:48.412 --> 00:33:49.747
Apologies, sir.

617
00:33:51.381 --> 00:33:52.684
Although, the little rat
did gain much experience.

618
00:33:52.717 --> 00:33:54.284
Isn't that right, Dismas?

619
00:33:56.654 --> 00:33:57.587
I didn't think you'd do it.

620
00:33:57.621 --> 00:33:58.656
Did you think he would, Abba?

621
00:33:58.690 --> 00:33:59.489
No, sir.

622
00:34:03.493 --> 00:34:07.264
I think the time has come
for you and your brother...

623
00:34:07.297 --> 00:34:09.399
to become permanent
members of our family.

624
00:34:10.668 --> 00:34:11.601
Is that understood?

625
00:34:12.502 --> 00:34:13.570
Yes.
Good.

626
00:34:14.538 --> 00:34:15.605
Then it's settled.

627
00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:17.441
But we do have one problem

628
00:34:17.474 --> 00:34:18.910
that we do need
to address first.

629
00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:22.680
Your error almost got us killed.

630
00:34:22.714 --> 00:34:24.614
For practically
nothing in return.

631
00:34:27.551 --> 00:34:28.753
You need to be punished.

632
00:34:30.587 --> 00:34:31.421
Gestas.

633
00:34:32.556 --> 00:34:33.958
Make me proud, son.

634
00:34:33.991 --> 00:34:34.892
(Dismas grunting)

635
00:34:34.926 --> 00:34:35.760
Let me go!

636
00:34:41.733 --> 00:34:44.601
(movning music)

637
00:34:48.039 --> 00:34:50.273
Jotham.

638
00:34:50.307 --> 00:34:51.374
You didn't have to.

639
00:34:52.609 --> 00:34:53.878
Don't ignore me.

640
00:34:53.911 --> 00:34:55.378
You know what I'm talking about.

641
00:34:55.412 --> 00:34:56.546
You gave me the sword!

642
00:34:59.016 --> 00:35:00.517
What was I supposed to do?

643
00:35:01.585 --> 00:35:04.621
We have always kept each other
alive, through everything!

644
00:35:05.288 --> 00:35:07.591
You have always kept me alive.

645
00:35:09.526 --> 00:35:11.561
And how do I save
you now brother?

646
00:35:12.529 --> 00:35:13.530
(grunts)

647
00:35:13.563 --> 00:35:15.767
(laughs)

648
00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:17.434
Looking good, brother.

649
00:35:17.467 --> 00:35:20.303
(swords clanging)

650
00:35:21.806 --> 00:35:22.774
Good.

651
00:35:22.807 --> 00:35:24.508
Watch your footwork, Jotham.

652
00:35:25.943 --> 00:35:28.012
(grunts)

653
00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:31.682
Sorry, brother.

654
00:35:32.582 --> 00:35:35.418
Keep your guard up, Dismas.

655
00:35:35.452 --> 00:35:36.654
The fight's never over.

656
00:35:38.455 --> 00:35:39.589
Come on, let's eat.

657
00:35:41.893 --> 00:35:44.662
(crowd shouting)

658
00:36:03.446 --> 00:36:04.782
(coins janglign)
Stop, thief!

659
00:36:04.816 --> 00:36:06.583
Guards!

660
00:36:06.616 --> 00:36:09.386
(dramatic music)

661
00:36:34.779 --> 00:36:37.647
(blowing horn)

662
00:37:00.604 --> 00:37:01.706
Longinus.

663
00:37:01.739 --> 00:37:04.507
It is fortunate to see
you've returned in one piece.

664
00:37:04.541 --> 00:37:05.343
Thank you Legatus.

665
00:37:05.375 --> 00:37:07.144
And I take it you
were successful?

666
00:37:07.178 --> 00:37:08.846
These barbarians have a penchant

667
00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:11.648
for dismembering those
who insult their pride.

668
00:37:11.682 --> 00:37:13.150
Yes sir.

669
00:37:13.184 --> 00:37:15.619
The Atrebates will resume
paying tribute at once.

670
00:37:17.154 --> 00:37:18.521
What's this one here for?

671
00:37:22.894 --> 00:37:23.895
Insurance.

672
00:37:25.629 --> 00:37:26.664
Very well.

673
00:37:27.464 --> 00:37:29.734
I have a new task
for you, Longinus.

674
00:37:29.767 --> 00:37:32.904
Our Judean friends are having
problems with brigands.

675
00:37:32.937 --> 00:37:34.437
Judea?

676
00:37:34.471 --> 00:37:35.072
The province is a festering...

677
00:37:35.106 --> 00:37:36.640
You forget yourself!

678
00:37:37.708 --> 00:37:39.944
Rome calls upon you to serve.

679
00:37:41.112 --> 00:37:43.981
Are you a servant of Rome?

680
00:37:45.249 --> 00:37:46.083
Yes, sir.

681
00:37:48.551 --> 00:37:49.186
Forgive me.

682
00:37:50.855 --> 00:37:52.189
For years these
bands of marauders

683
00:37:52.223 --> 00:37:54.491
have terrorized the populace.

684
00:37:54.524 --> 00:37:55.558
They're questioning
Rome's ability

685
00:37:55.592 --> 00:37:57.828
to keep her citizens safe.

686
00:37:57.862 --> 00:38:01.032
I selected you for this task
because of how you put down

687
00:38:01.065 --> 00:38:03.600
the insurrection among
these Celtic tribes!

688
00:38:03.633 --> 00:38:05.036
You will go to Judea,

689
00:38:05.069 --> 00:38:08.638
eradicate these savages
and restore order!

690
00:38:11.608 --> 00:38:12.642
Is that clear?

691
00:38:14.611 --> 00:38:16.013
It will be done.

692
00:38:16.047 --> 00:38:18.648
(tense music)

693
00:38:19.850 --> 00:38:22.519
What news of the
caravan you're scouting?

694
00:38:22.552 --> 00:38:23.421
They look like merchants.

695
00:38:23.453 --> 00:38:26.589
Heavy laden wagons
with only a few men.

696
00:38:26.623 --> 00:38:27.658
How many men?

697
00:38:27.692 --> 00:38:28.625
Nine or 10.

698
00:38:28.659 --> 00:38:30.593
Well is it nine or is it 10?

699
00:38:31.262 --> 00:38:32.663
Relax, Dismas.

700
00:38:32.697 --> 00:38:34.699
You're like an old
woman these days.

701
00:38:35.833 --> 00:38:37.600
Relax, brother.

702
00:38:37.634 --> 00:38:39.569
There's only
merchants, no guards.

703
00:38:41.538 --> 00:38:43.540
Gestas is right, you do
worry like an old woman.

704
00:38:43.573 --> 00:38:45.575
Yeah, an old woman who
can take either of you

705
00:38:45.608 --> 00:38:47.510
in a sword fight any day.

706
00:38:47.544 --> 00:38:48.446
So don't forget it?

707
00:38:48.478 --> 00:38:50.848
Gestas, do you think
it's worth the risk?

708
00:38:51.983 --> 00:38:52.817
I do.

709
00:38:53.918 --> 00:38:55.152
Then we ride at dark.

710
00:38:57.054 --> 00:38:57.955
Gestas...

711
00:38:59.622 --> 00:39:01.158
you're in command of this one.

712
00:39:02.927 --> 00:39:04.028
Thank you, father.

713
00:39:04.061 --> 00:39:04.895
Come.

714
00:39:06.097 --> 00:39:07.630
Tell me of your strategy.

715
00:39:07.665 --> 00:39:10.134
(curious music)

716
00:39:15.673 --> 00:39:16.606
(sword clangs)

717
00:39:16.639 --> 00:39:18.009
How's the edge on that thing?

718
00:39:19.343 --> 00:39:20.577
Give it here.

719
00:39:26.183 --> 00:39:27.918
What are you so angry about?

720
00:39:27.952 --> 00:39:29.020
I'm not angry.

721
00:39:30.287 --> 00:39:31.288
Dismas...

722
00:39:32.857 --> 00:39:33.691
Dismas...

723
00:39:35.326 --> 00:39:36.994
All the men in this camp,
they treat me like a man.

724
00:39:37.028 --> 00:39:38.696
Why can't you?

725
00:39:38.729 --> 00:39:40.998
Look, I know this
isn't an easy life,

726
00:39:41.032 --> 00:39:43.234
but it provides for us.

727
00:39:43.267 --> 00:39:45.535
I promised mother I
would protect you.

728
00:39:46.504 --> 00:39:49.340
You make a wrong move,
(snaps finger) one mistake,

729
00:39:49.373 --> 00:39:50.640
it could get you killed.

730
00:39:51.876 --> 00:39:53.778
So no mistakes.

731
00:39:53.811 --> 00:39:54.879
No mistakes then.

732
00:39:56.613 --> 00:39:58.315
No mistakes.

733
00:39:58.349 --> 00:40:01.018
(curious music)

734
00:40:30.081 --> 00:40:30.881
(dramatic music)

735
00:40:30.915 --> 00:40:33.184
(shouting)

736
00:41:18.796 --> 00:41:19.629
Come, brother.

737
00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:38.949
(groaning)

738
00:41:50.027 --> 00:41:52.229
(humming)

739
00:42:03.073 --> 00:42:06.243
I don't think he's
going to make it.

740
00:42:20.991 --> 00:42:21.825
Move.

741
00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:32.069
(groaning)

742
00:43:06.103 --> 00:43:06.904
Whoa!

743
00:43:06.937 --> 00:43:08.105
Lie down, brother.

744
00:43:11.442 --> 00:43:12.476
What happened?

745
00:43:13.811 --> 00:43:15.813
Centurion put his
spear through you.

746
00:43:17.114 --> 00:43:18.415
Tore a pretty good sized hole.

747
00:43:20.584 --> 00:43:22.419
You've been here three days.

748
00:43:23.454 --> 00:43:24.922
You should be dead.

749
00:43:25.556 --> 00:43:26.824
Where are we?

750
00:43:26.857 --> 00:43:27.524
Jerusalem.

751
00:43:28.892 --> 00:43:30.761
Father has a woman
here who took us in.

752
00:43:34.098 --> 00:43:35.432
You said three days?

753
00:43:36.967 --> 00:43:39.003
You were out for
four, with a fever.

754
00:43:39.970 --> 00:43:40.838
Been here three.

755
00:43:42.306 --> 00:43:43.974
The healer said that
you wouldn't make it,

756
00:43:44.008 --> 00:43:46.210
but I told her you
were too tough.

757
00:43:46.243 --> 00:43:47.077
Now look at you.

758
00:43:48.879 --> 00:43:50.180
Aren't I the lucky one?

759
00:43:51.115 --> 00:43:53.183
(groans)

760
00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:58.122
What about the rest of the men?

761
00:43:59.590 --> 00:44:00.424
At the cave.

762
00:44:01.925 --> 00:44:03.427
The ones who made
it out at least.

763
00:44:04.461 --> 00:44:06.030
What is it, Gestas?

764
00:44:06.063 --> 00:44:06.897
Tell me.

765
00:44:10.501 --> 00:44:11.302
Come.

766
00:44:12.202 --> 00:44:13.003
Thank you.

767
00:44:14.338 --> 00:44:15.239
For coming back.

768
00:44:16.373 --> 00:44:19.410
I know you did it for your
brother, but you saved me too.

769
00:44:20.878 --> 00:44:23.047
You would have done it for me.

770
00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:24.281
No.

771
00:44:24.315 --> 00:44:25.349
I wouldn't have.

772
00:44:28.552 --> 00:44:30.521
I've hated you from
the day we met.

773
00:44:34.659 --> 00:44:36.060
You earned respect.

774
00:44:37.528 --> 00:44:40.064
To speak truly, that only
made me despise you more.

775
00:44:41.365 --> 00:44:42.466
Jealous, I suppose.

776
00:44:46.437 --> 00:44:49.139
I've shown you nothing but
cruelty over the years.

777
00:44:50.207 --> 00:44:53.844
We all have had
difficult childhoods.

778
00:44:56.447 --> 00:45:00.551
I've always hoped that
we could become friends.

779
00:45:00.584 --> 00:45:01.485
You are my brother.

780
00:45:04.421 --> 00:45:05.489
No more distrust.

781
00:45:07.091 --> 00:45:08.592
No more anger. No more cruelty.

782
00:45:11.395 --> 00:45:16.066
From this day on, I will look
out for you and Jotham...

783
00:45:18.102 --> 00:45:21.638
as if you were my own brothers,
my own flesh and blood.

784
00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:23.941
I swear it.

785
00:45:26.176 --> 00:45:27.611
I trust your words.

786
00:45:31.482 --> 00:45:32.516
Get some rest.

787
00:45:34.551 --> 00:45:37.321
(dramatic music)

788
00:46:00.244 --> 00:46:01.211
Watch your step there.

789
00:46:01.245 --> 00:46:02.613
These streets are terrible.

790
00:46:04.114 --> 00:46:05.416
I hate this city.

791
00:46:05.449 --> 00:46:07.184
Yeah.

792
00:46:07.217 --> 00:46:09.086
You hate all cities.

793
00:46:09.119 --> 00:46:10.521
Too noisy.

794
00:46:10.554 --> 00:46:12.289
I grew up sleeping
in the desert.

795
00:46:12.322 --> 00:46:13.457
I'm used to quiet.

796
00:46:13.490 --> 00:46:14.358
(chuckles)

797
00:46:14.391 --> 00:46:17.127
Aside from the regular
nighttime raids.

798
00:46:19.363 --> 00:46:20.597
I want some fruit.

799
00:46:20.631 --> 00:46:21.465
You want some fruit?

800
00:46:21.498 --> 00:46:22.700
Figs?

801
00:46:22.734 --> 00:46:23.567
Sure.

802
00:46:25.469 --> 00:46:27.504
I think I over did it, boys.

803
00:46:28.505 --> 00:46:29.973
I'm gonna sit for a while.

804
00:46:31.341 --> 00:46:32.342
Are you okay?

805
00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:34.679
I'm fine.

806
00:46:34.712 --> 00:46:36.980
Go, go to the marketplace.

807
00:46:38.148 --> 00:46:39.550
I just need some rest.

808
00:46:39.583 --> 00:46:40.417
You sure?

809
00:46:40.451 --> 00:46:41.452
Yes, go.

810
00:46:41.485 --> 00:46:42.319
I'll be fine.

811
00:46:46.490 --> 00:46:47.524
Go.

812
00:46:49.526 --> 00:46:50.627
I'll bring you back a fig.

813
00:46:50.662 --> 00:46:51.495
Okay.

814
00:47:08.479 --> 00:47:11.515
(emotional music)

815
00:47:42.613 --> 00:47:46.216
Our journeys began
in this place.

816
00:47:46.250 --> 00:47:47.084
Yeshua?

817
00:47:49.453 --> 00:47:50.254
I am.

818
00:47:56.393 --> 00:47:57.494
Why am I here?

819
00:47:58.529 --> 00:48:02.734
You are here because you seek
the past and not the future.

820
00:48:04.568 --> 00:48:08.605
What you thirst for is not here.

821
00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:12.810
I have not been back here
since my mother was killed.

822
00:48:15.312 --> 00:48:17.047
That night, a part
of me died too.

823
00:48:19.717 --> 00:48:22.820
She was the only person
who ever truly loved me.

824
00:48:24.856 --> 00:48:29.794
If she saw me now,
she would be ashamed.

825
00:48:31.696 --> 00:48:33.230
She would never forgive me.

826
00:48:35.499 --> 00:48:38.302
No one is beyond forgiveness.

827
00:48:40.604 --> 00:48:45.108
You are bound by chains, and
know not that you have the key.

828
00:48:48.378 --> 00:48:50.247
Seek forgiveness
from the Father,

829
00:48:52.784 --> 00:48:54.484
and He will set you free.

830
00:48:55.519 --> 00:48:56.854
I deserve my fate.

831
00:48:58.622 --> 00:49:02.326
I just hope it's not too late
for my brother, and me too.

832
00:49:07.665 --> 00:49:09.299
I heard you are a healer.

833
00:49:12.269 --> 00:49:13.604
Can you help me?

834
00:49:14.504 --> 00:49:15.840
Can you make me well again?

835
00:49:20.477 --> 00:49:21.545
Rise, Dismas.

836
00:49:23.647 --> 00:49:25.582
Your journey is far from over.

837
00:49:32.857 --> 00:49:33.691
Dismas?

838
00:49:36.259 --> 00:49:39.529
I want every man here...

839
00:49:39.563 --> 00:49:41.231
to know...

840
00:49:41.264 --> 00:49:42.734
that I am indebted to you...

841
00:49:44.936 --> 00:49:46.771
for saving my son.

842
00:49:46.804 --> 00:49:48.271
To Dismas!

843
00:49:48.305 --> 00:49:49.707
Dismas!

844
00:49:49.741 --> 00:49:53.310
Now, to speak truthfully,
I'm growing old,

845
00:49:53.343 --> 00:49:55.445
and the time has come
for me to find a wife

846
00:49:55.479 --> 00:49:56.613
and a few mistresses.

847
00:49:56.647 --> 00:49:59.182
(men laugh)

848
00:49:59.817 --> 00:50:01.518
And settle down.

849
00:50:01.551 --> 00:50:04.588
Enjoy the spoils of life.

850
00:50:05.489 --> 00:50:06.556
But before that day comes,

851
00:50:06.590 --> 00:50:08.625
because that day
has not arrived yet,

852
00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:11.495
Dismas...

853
00:50:12.596 --> 00:50:14.398
Is the one whose
lead you will follow.

854
00:50:15.532 --> 00:50:16.834
From this day forward...

855
00:50:18.936 --> 00:50:22.674
you are to follow his commands
as if they were my own.

856
00:50:24.541 --> 00:50:27.277
To legacies and legends!

857
00:50:27.310 --> 00:50:29.646
(men cheer)

858
00:50:34.651 --> 00:50:35.753
Don't worry about Gestas.

859
00:50:36.688 --> 00:50:37.689
He's sulking.

860
00:50:37.722 --> 00:50:39.289
He'll be fine.

861
00:50:39.322 --> 00:50:40.892
It's not Gestas
that concerns me.

862
00:50:44.929 --> 00:50:47.364
Shouldn't Abba be the
one to lead the men?

863
00:50:47.397 --> 00:50:48.733
Abba?

864
00:50:48.766 --> 00:50:50.467
Have you gone mad?

865
00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:51.401
How long do you think
these men would last

866
00:50:51.435 --> 00:50:54.471
with that bloodthirsty
oaf as their chief?

867
00:50:54.504 --> 00:50:55.840
They'd all be killed
in a glorious battle

868
00:50:55.873 --> 00:50:58.508
with the Romans
before the year's end.

869
00:50:58.542 --> 00:50:59.543
Dismas...

870
00:51:01.278 --> 00:51:02.512
you are the right choice.

871
00:51:03.647 --> 00:51:04.916
Every man here knows it.

872
00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:09.854
And now...

873
00:51:10.722 --> 00:51:12.690
for a proper celebration.

874
00:51:12.724 --> 00:51:17.662
Word has reached my ear
about our old friend, Thomas.

875
00:51:17.695 --> 00:51:20.464
(men grumble)

876
00:51:20.497 --> 00:51:23.633
That's right, you
remember the traitor.

877
00:51:23.668 --> 00:51:25.469
I won't even call him a man.

878
00:51:25.502 --> 00:51:28.405
He abandoned us,
he stole from us,

879
00:51:29.606 --> 00:51:32.542
He hid in the hills
like a coward.

880
00:51:32.576 --> 00:51:33.477
(tense music)

881
00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:35.713
He has now forgotten who he is.

882
00:51:36.546 --> 00:51:38.615
But we do not forget.

883
00:51:40.051 --> 00:51:41.018
We know who we are.

884
00:51:42.385 --> 00:51:44.021
We're going to take
back what is ours.

885
00:51:46.991 --> 00:51:49.727
(birds chirping)

886
00:51:56.333 --> 00:51:56.901
Gestas.

887
00:51:59.603 --> 00:52:01.505
Thought I might
find you out here.

888
00:52:06.576 --> 00:52:07.812
How could he do that to me?

889
00:52:09.513 --> 00:52:10.514
I'm his son.

890
00:52:11.749 --> 00:52:14.018
I've done everything
he's ever asked of me.

891
00:52:15.652 --> 00:52:17.789
I've earned the right to
take over when he's gone.

892
00:52:18.990 --> 00:52:21.424
You know Dismas couldn't
have known, right?

893
00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:25.696
He probably doesn't
even want...

894
00:52:29.033 --> 00:52:31.368
Dismas would never
do that to you.

895
00:52:32.970 --> 00:52:34.972
I'm not mad at Dismas.

896
00:52:35.673 --> 00:52:39.076
It's my father who's the fool.

897
00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:40.244
He didn't have to
choose right now,

898
00:52:40.278 --> 00:52:43.446
he could have waited, given
me a chance to prove myself.

899
00:52:46.616 --> 00:52:47.952
I should kill him while he
sleeps and take what's mine.

900
00:52:47.985 --> 00:52:49.787
Gestas, you cannot
talk like this.

901
00:52:52.657 --> 00:52:55.660
Tiran needed to choose
someone with a level head.

902
00:52:57.561 --> 00:52:59.462
You know that.

903
00:52:59.496 --> 00:53:01.699
(soft music)

904
00:53:10.473 --> 00:53:11.575
Gestas...

905
00:53:11.608 --> 00:53:12.642
I didn't know.

906
00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:14.544
Of course not.

907
00:53:16.714 --> 00:53:18.615
You forget my father
was ashamed of me

908
00:53:18.648 --> 00:53:20.417
long before my
brothers came along.

909
00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:24.621
You've done nothing wrong by me.

910
00:53:26.691 --> 00:53:29.426
My problem is with my
father, not my brothers.

911
00:53:32.596 --> 00:53:33.764
I'm glad you understand.

912
00:53:40.805 --> 00:53:43.708
I am going to drink
myself to sleep now.

913
00:53:43.741 --> 00:53:44.709
Good night.

914
00:53:44.742 --> 00:53:45.575
Be well.

915
00:53:49.947 --> 00:53:51.883
Brother, I need to talk to you.

916
00:53:51.916 --> 00:53:52.783
What is it?

917
00:53:52.817 --> 00:53:54.484
Is it about Gestas?

918
00:53:54.517 --> 00:53:56.821
You're gonna think I've
gone mad, but hear me out.

919
00:53:57.722 --> 00:53:58.521
Promise me.

920
00:54:00.024 --> 00:54:00.858
Okay, I promise.

921
00:54:00.892 --> 00:54:02.492
You saw my wound.

922
00:54:02.525 --> 00:54:04.594
You saw how bad it was, right?

923
00:54:06.130 --> 00:54:07.631
I saw it, what of it?

924
00:54:07.665 --> 00:54:09.901
You remember the night
mother was killed?

925
00:54:12.569 --> 00:54:16.573
The baby that was
born in the stable?

926
00:54:16.606 --> 00:54:17.607
Yeshua...

927
00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:20.945
I remember.

928
00:54:20.978 --> 00:54:24.982
In Nazareth, when
you and Gestas...

929
00:54:25.016 --> 00:54:28.551
went to the marketplace,
I was by the gate.

930
00:54:29.854 --> 00:54:30.755
I fell asleep.

931
00:54:32.023 --> 00:54:33.758
I had a dream, a vision.

932
00:54:35.793 --> 00:54:36.626
He came to me.

933
00:54:37.728 --> 00:54:38.561
We spoke.

934
00:54:41.032 --> 00:54:43.968
He said that no one
was beyond forgiveness

935
00:54:44.001 --> 00:54:48.139
and that I must ask the
Father to forgive me.

936
00:54:49.807 --> 00:54:52.575
We spoke about him
being a healer.

937
00:54:53.643 --> 00:54:54.644
I asked could he heal me.

938
00:54:56.613 --> 00:54:58.683
I asked him to
make me well again.

939
00:54:58.716 --> 00:55:01.551
It sounds like he cast
some sort of spell on you.

940
00:55:01.584 --> 00:55:02.619
No spell.

941
00:55:03.421 --> 00:55:07.590
It was him, and he came
to me, and he healed me.

942
00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:11.929
Dismas, that is not possible.

943
00:55:12.930 --> 00:55:14.966
Remember what the Magi said?

944
00:55:14.999 --> 00:55:20.004
He said that the baby's
birth fulfilled a prophesy.

945
00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:26.177
I remember.

946
00:55:26.210 --> 00:55:29.512
I remember that that prophesy

947
00:55:29.546 --> 00:55:31.849
is the reason why the
soldiers came to Bethlehem,

948
00:55:32.984 --> 00:55:35.219
why they killed mother and Aram.

949
00:55:35.252 --> 00:55:36.053
I remember it, brother.

950
00:55:36.087 --> 00:55:36.988
How could I forget?

951
00:55:38.089 --> 00:55:41.158
Jotham, what if they were right?

952
00:55:41.192 --> 00:55:43.227
They were superstitious old men!

953
00:55:45.628 --> 00:55:48.598
Dismas, what kind of
savior brings death

954
00:55:48.631 --> 00:55:50.134
to everyone around him?

955
00:55:50.167 --> 00:55:52.703
Well, surely you remember
the day at the well.

956
00:55:53.603 --> 00:55:54.839
You saw it.

957
00:55:54.872 --> 00:55:55.840
You felt it, too.

958
00:55:55.873 --> 00:55:57.241
I don't know what I saw!

959
00:55:58.976 --> 00:56:01.611
It could have been a
dream for all we know.

960
00:56:01.644 --> 00:56:03.147
There's no way you believe that.

961
00:56:04.048 --> 00:56:06.951
And who are you to
tell me what I believe?

962
00:56:06.984 --> 00:56:08.719
I'm your brother.

963
00:56:08.753 --> 00:56:09.619
That's who I am!

964
00:56:09.652 --> 00:56:10.821
Get back here!

965
00:56:13.357 --> 00:56:16.559
(atmospheric music)

966
00:56:22.666 --> 00:56:25.568
(children laughing)

967
00:56:46.257 --> 00:56:47.058
Thomas.

968
00:56:49.026 --> 00:56:49.860
Tiran.

969
00:56:51.395 --> 00:56:52.930
You plan on using that?

970
00:56:55.666 --> 00:56:57.068
That's up to you, old friend.

971
00:56:58.235 --> 00:57:00.071
You shouldn't have
stolen what's ours.

972
00:57:01.272 --> 00:57:03.140
I only took what
was rightfully mine.

973
00:57:03.174 --> 00:57:05.608
Use that sword, they die.

974
00:57:06.609 --> 00:57:09.346
Give it to me, settle your
debt, and we'll be on our way.

975
00:57:12.416 --> 00:57:13.650
What, Thomas?

976
00:57:16.754 --> 00:57:17.922
You'll let them live?

977
00:57:41.445 --> 00:57:42.379
Kill the family.

978
00:57:42.413 --> 00:57:43.646
No!

979
00:57:43.681 --> 00:57:44.682
(groaning)

980
00:57:44.715 --> 00:57:47.318
(swords clanging)

981
00:57:47.351 --> 00:57:48.152
Run!

982
00:57:48.185 --> 00:57:48.986
Run!

983
00:57:49.019 --> 00:57:49.854
Run, run!

984
00:57:52.089 --> 00:57:54.158
(grunts)

985
00:58:00.364 --> 00:58:01.832
Run, run!

986
00:58:01.866 --> 00:58:04.101
(grunting)

987
00:58:08.339 --> 00:58:10.608
(groans)

988
00:58:15.279 --> 00:58:17.214
See you on the other side.

989
00:58:18.816 --> 00:58:19.649
Dismas!

990
00:58:21.051 --> 00:58:22.419
Why'd you let the boy go?

991
00:58:29.026 --> 00:58:30.294
This has gone too far.

992
00:58:31.295 --> 00:58:35.099
We must go, before we get
dragged any deeper into this.

993
00:58:37.101 --> 00:58:38.702
Tiran has been good to us.

994
00:58:40.237 --> 00:58:41.372
Tiran is mad.

995
00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:44.275
No.

996
00:58:45.743 --> 00:58:47.845
We ride hard to Jerusalem.

997
00:58:50.514 --> 00:58:51.749
Tonight.

998
00:58:53.150 --> 00:58:54.351
When the men are asleep.

999
00:58:56.086 --> 00:58:58.122
Take the money we have stashed.

1000
00:58:58.155 --> 00:59:02.393
Buy fresh horses
and keep on riding.

1001
00:59:03.194 --> 00:59:06.063
Dismas, one mistake
and we're dead.

1002
00:59:06.096 --> 00:59:06.931
No mistakes.

1003
00:59:06.964 --> 00:59:09.733
(uneasy music)

1004
00:59:11.402 --> 00:59:13.304
All we need is food and water

1005
00:59:13.971 --> 00:59:15.839
to last us until tomorrow night.

1006
00:59:18.209 --> 00:59:19.476
We don't need anything else.

1007
00:59:20.945 --> 00:59:21.779
I'm afraid.

1008
00:59:24.548 --> 00:59:25.382
So am I.

1009
00:59:27.851 --> 00:59:29.753
But we use the
fear to stay sharp.

1010
00:59:33.457 --> 00:59:34.291
Brother.

1011
00:59:35.226 --> 00:59:37.361
Get as much rest as you can.

1012
00:59:37.394 --> 00:59:40.231
It's a long ride to the city.

1013
00:59:40.264 --> 00:59:42.766
(tense music)

1014
01:00:33.917 --> 01:00:36.520
Where are you off to?

1015
01:00:38.622 --> 01:00:40.557
I was going to go investigate
the noise that I...

1016
01:00:40.591 --> 01:00:42.526
(punches)

1017
01:00:43.527 --> 01:00:45.062
You're a liar, Jotham.

1018
01:00:46.497 --> 01:00:48.899
See, Gestas told
me of your plan.

1019
01:00:52.536 --> 01:00:53.337
Gestas?

1020
01:00:54.471 --> 01:00:55.506
You did this?

1021
01:00:56.974 --> 01:00:58.842
You were two rats
in a desert alone.

1022
01:01:00.177 --> 01:01:01.345
I gave you both a home.

1023
01:01:02.613 --> 01:01:03.881
I raised you.

1024
01:01:05.115 --> 01:01:06.450
Trusted you.

1025
01:01:06.483 --> 01:01:08.185
Forgive us, Tiran.

1026
01:01:08.218 --> 01:01:10.220
Father, please don't kill them.

1027
01:01:10.254 --> 01:01:11.488
They deserve punishment,
but not death.

1028
01:01:11.522 --> 01:01:12.956
(punches)

1029
01:01:12.990 --> 01:01:14.425
The punishment for
treason is death!

1030
01:01:16.327 --> 01:01:17.161
On your feet.

1031
01:01:18.962 --> 01:01:21.165
These two men no
longer want to be here.

1032
01:01:21.198 --> 01:01:23.400
Now, we're going to
help make that possible.

1033
01:01:23.434 --> 01:01:24.435
Tiran, no.

1034
01:01:25.569 --> 01:01:27.137
You can't do this!

1035
01:01:27.171 --> 01:01:28.305
Dismas?

1036
01:01:28.339 --> 01:01:31.575
Tonight, one of you will
live, and one of you will die.

1037
01:01:31.608 --> 01:01:33.377
You will fight each
other to the death,

1038
01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:34.978
and the survivor is free.

1039
01:01:37.281 --> 01:01:38.382
No.

1040
01:01:38.415 --> 01:01:39.883
I won't kill my brother!

1041
01:01:41.452 --> 01:01:43.087
We've done you no injury.

1042
01:01:44.321 --> 01:01:45.956
We only wanted to leave.

1043
01:01:47.157 --> 01:01:48.092
Please.

1044
01:01:48.125 --> 01:01:50.160
Please, don't make us do this.

1045
01:01:50.194 --> 01:01:53.397
Father, cast them both out,
a harsh but just punishment.

1046
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:54.331
I beg you.

1047
01:01:54.365 --> 01:01:58.302
You do not to get to
beg for their lives.

1048
01:01:58.335 --> 01:01:59.603
That's not how this works.

1049
01:02:00.471 --> 01:02:04.041
You need to slither
back to your bedroll.

1050
01:02:04.074 --> 01:02:06.443
You don't have the stomach
for what comes next.

1051
01:02:08.979 --> 01:02:09.613
Be gone.

1052
01:02:12.416 --> 01:02:14.118
Jotham, I can't do this.

1053
01:02:15.586 --> 01:02:17.689
I won't.

1054
01:02:17.722 --> 01:02:22.192
If we're going to die, we're
going to do it fighting!

1055
01:02:22.226 --> 01:02:23.460
Abba, swords.

1056
01:02:28.165 --> 01:02:29.066
Square them off.

1057
01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:31.435
Kill anyone who draws near.

1058
01:02:35.639 --> 01:02:37.441
Enough with the farewells.

1059
01:02:38.442 --> 01:02:39.476
Fight.

1060
01:02:41.378 --> 01:02:42.680
(suspenseful music)

1061
01:02:42.714 --> 01:02:45.048
You both want to die tonight?

1062
01:02:45.082 --> 01:02:46.517
Abba, end this!

1063
01:02:46.550 --> 01:02:48.485
(shouting)

1064
01:02:48.519 --> 01:02:50.020
(blood spurting)

1065
01:02:50.053 --> 01:02:51.555
Let's end these...

1066
01:02:58.462 --> 01:03:00.097
(emotional music)

1067
01:03:00.130 --> 01:03:00.964
Go.

1068
01:03:00.998 --> 01:03:01.632
And never return.

1069
01:03:03.133 --> 01:03:03.967
Never.

1070
01:03:12.509 --> 01:03:15.512
You lay eyes on them
again, kill them.

1071
01:03:15.546 --> 01:03:16.613
Standing orders.

1072
01:03:17.581 --> 01:03:19.049
(crowd shouting)

1073
01:03:19.082 --> 01:03:23.954
Barrabas, Barrabas, Barrabas!

1074
01:03:27.759 --> 01:03:29.293
They're singing my song!

1075
01:03:32.029 --> 01:03:32.664
Barabbas?

1076
01:03:34.097 --> 01:03:34.732
You hear that?

1077
01:03:36.133 --> 01:03:39.136
Kill a few Romans,
and you're a hero.

1078
01:03:39.169 --> 01:03:40.437
Sent by the Father.

1079
01:03:42.639 --> 01:03:44.174
A hero for killing.

1080
01:03:48.278 --> 01:03:49.112
Yeshua?

1081
01:03:49.814 --> 01:03:51.582
That insane rabbi?

1082
01:03:51.615 --> 01:03:54.618
(cell door clangs)

1083
01:03:54.651 --> 01:03:56.754
Barrabas, come with me.

1084
01:03:59.590 --> 01:04:01.191
You're going to see the prefect.

1085
01:04:02.559 --> 01:04:04.094
I guess the Romans
have a special treat

1086
01:04:04.127 --> 01:04:05.462
in mind for me, boys.

1087
01:04:10.567 --> 01:04:12.536
(cell door clanks)

1088
01:04:12.569 --> 01:04:13.504
What about us?

1089
01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:17.541
Patience, thief.

1090
01:04:18.642 --> 01:04:19.744
Your time will come.

1091
01:04:25.649 --> 01:04:27.752
You really think you
deserved that life?

1092
01:04:29.386 --> 01:04:31.723
You should have let that
girl marry an honest man.

1093
01:04:31.756 --> 01:04:33.290
I was being an honest man.

1094
01:04:33.323 --> 01:04:34.291
By lying to her?

1095
01:04:35.626 --> 01:04:37.094
I love her.

1096
01:04:37.127 --> 01:04:38.595
What would you have me do?

1097
01:04:38.629 --> 01:04:40.330
(soft music)

1098
01:04:40.364 --> 01:04:43.033
(birds calling)

1099
01:04:47.271 --> 01:04:49.172
It's a beautiful day.

1100
01:04:50.307 --> 01:04:52.376
I hate Capernaum.

1101
01:04:52.409 --> 01:04:54.077
The whole place
smells like fish.

1102
01:04:55.546 --> 01:04:58.282
It's work, honest work.

1103
01:04:59.449 --> 01:05:00.685
Possible work.

1104
01:05:02.319 --> 01:05:04.756
I mean, who wants to hire
people like us anyways?

1105
01:05:04.789 --> 01:05:07.391
Who wouldn't want to
hire two charming rogues?

1106
01:05:08.793 --> 01:05:09.794
Excuse me sir?

1107
01:05:11.696 --> 01:05:13.597
We're looking for Darius.

1108
01:05:13.630 --> 01:05:14.766
You looking for work?

1109
01:05:15.867 --> 01:05:16.701
Yes.

1110
01:05:16.734 --> 01:05:18.068
We hear he's hiring.

1111
01:05:19.269 --> 01:05:21.773
He is, but he's a
bear to work for.

1112
01:05:21.806 --> 01:05:23.640
Long hours, and he yells a lot.

1113
01:05:23.675 --> 01:05:25.175
Great.

1114
01:05:25.208 --> 01:05:26.476
Sounds like another
drunken sailor

1115
01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:29.580
who likes to crack a
whip to feel superior.

1116
01:05:29.613 --> 01:05:33.584
He's fair, but he doesn't
tolerate nonsense or laziness.

1117
01:05:33.617 --> 01:05:34.618
Believes a man with character

1118
01:05:34.651 --> 01:05:36.386
should work hard for his wages.

1119
01:05:37.621 --> 01:05:38.823
I can agree with that.

1120
01:05:40.524 --> 01:05:42.225
But does he train?

1121
01:05:42.259 --> 01:05:44.227
We've never made nets before.

1122
01:05:44.261 --> 01:05:45.429
He'll train you.

1123
01:05:45.462 --> 01:05:46.664
At half wage.

1124
01:05:46.698 --> 01:05:48.332
As long as you don't run
off to a fishing boat

1125
01:05:48.365 --> 01:05:50.434
as soon as there's an opening.

1126
01:05:50.467 --> 01:05:52.536
Pretty sure that's
called slavery.

1127
01:05:52.569 --> 01:05:55.105
You have soft hands,
like a woman's.

1128
01:05:55.873 --> 01:05:57.507
That won't last.

1129
01:05:57.541 --> 01:06:00.477
Okay, we'll work for half wages.

1130
01:06:00.510 --> 01:06:03.246
Can you introduce us
to Darius, please?

1131
01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:04.181
I'm Darius.

1132
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:07.150
I like you.

1133
01:06:07.184 --> 01:06:07.785
You're hired.

1134
01:06:09.252 --> 01:06:10.420
You too.

1135
01:06:10.454 --> 01:06:13.624
Don't have as good a feeling
about you, but I'm shorthanded.

1136
01:06:14.826 --> 01:06:16.627
Come back at midday, you start.

1137
01:06:17.561 --> 01:06:18.528
Thank you.

1138
01:06:18.562 --> 01:06:20.430
You won't be disappointed.

1139
01:06:21.531 --> 01:06:23.668
I will, but you'll get better.

1140
01:06:24.769 --> 01:06:27.604
(emotional music)

1141
01:06:29.373 --> 01:06:30.474
That's good.

1142
01:06:30.507 --> 01:06:31.341
Very good.

1143
01:06:33.610 --> 01:06:34.779
I had a good teacher.

1144
01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:38.515
Six months and
you'll be excellent.

1145
01:06:41.418 --> 01:06:42.820
Your friend didn't want the job?

1146
01:06:45.489 --> 01:06:46.490
I'm afraid not.

1147
01:06:48.926 --> 01:06:50.895
He's sleeping on the floor

1148
01:06:50.928 --> 01:06:52.697
of a room that I'm
renting for now.

1149
01:06:54.297 --> 01:06:57.534
Why in the heavens are you
friends with a man like that?

1150
01:06:57.567 --> 01:07:00.203
(sighs)

1151
01:07:00.237 --> 01:07:01.171
He's my brother.

1152
01:07:02.774 --> 01:07:03.775
Ah.

1153
01:07:03.808 --> 01:07:04.641
Family.

1154
01:07:10.447 --> 01:07:11.448
Keep working.

1155
01:07:12.516 --> 01:07:15.552
(emotional music)

1156
01:07:43.815 --> 01:07:45.348
May I help you with that?

1157
01:07:47.317 --> 01:07:47.952
I can do it.

1158
01:07:49.619 --> 01:07:51.889
I'm know you can, but
I can carry it for you.

1159
01:07:54.524 --> 01:07:56.526
Your new here on the docks.

1160
01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:57.627
I am.

1161
01:07:57.662 --> 01:07:58.462
Fisherman?

1162
01:07:58.495 --> 01:07:59.529
I'm net maker.

1163
01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:01.631
Assistant net maker.

1164
01:08:04.334 --> 01:08:05.535
Apprentice net maker.

1165
01:08:05.569 --> 01:08:07.739
I'm still learning.

1166
01:08:07.772 --> 01:08:08.605
To make nets?

1167
01:08:10.708 --> 01:08:12.509
Yes

1168
01:08:12.542 --> 01:08:14.444
My father is always
looking for an apprentice

1169
01:08:14.478 --> 01:08:16.781
who will stay more
than a few months.

1170
01:08:16.814 --> 01:08:17.647
Your father?

1171
01:08:18.615 --> 01:08:19.649
Darius.

1172
01:08:22.019 --> 01:08:23.788
This is my brother, Teman.

1173
01:08:23.821 --> 01:08:24.722
I'm Dismas.

1174
01:08:27.725 --> 01:08:29.626
I'm glad to have
met you, net maker.

1175
01:08:31.796 --> 01:08:33.430
I must return to the market,

1176
01:08:33.463 --> 01:08:35.465
but I shall I see you again
if you're still around.

1177
01:08:36.768 --> 01:08:38.301
I'll be here.

1178
01:08:38.335 --> 01:08:38.970
Shalom.

1179
01:08:42.073 --> 01:08:44.909
(emotional music)

1180
01:08:56.586 --> 01:08:58.689
Welcome back, brother.

1181
01:08:59.924 --> 01:09:01.591
Well...

1182
01:09:01.625 --> 01:09:03.627
apparently they
stop giving you wine

1183
01:09:03.661 --> 01:09:05.062
when you stop giving them coin.

1184
01:09:07.865 --> 01:09:09.599
You should come work with me.

1185
01:09:10.634 --> 01:09:11.969
Darius may hire you yet.

1186
01:09:13.503 --> 01:09:14.471
You know, used to...

1187
01:09:14.504 --> 01:09:16.707
if we wanted more to drink...

1188
01:09:17.875 --> 01:09:18.709
I took more.

1189
01:09:20.410 --> 01:09:21.679
No one dared refuse us.

1190
01:09:27.685 --> 01:09:29.020
Give me some from the stash.

1191
01:09:29.053 --> 01:09:31.521
It's just as much
mine as it is yours.

1192
01:09:32.422 --> 01:09:34.692
And if I did, it
would be none of ours.

1193
01:09:35.625 --> 01:09:36.459
So, no.

1194
01:09:38.395 --> 01:09:39.030
Fine.

1195
01:09:42.867 --> 01:09:44.334
I'll make my own money.

1196
01:09:46.938 --> 01:09:49.539
That Yeshua is drawing
in quite a crowd.

1197
01:09:51.976 --> 01:09:55.512
I'm sure one of those fanatics
has got to carry gold.

1198
01:09:55.545 --> 01:09:57.014
Jotham, no!

1199
01:09:59.984 --> 01:10:01.518
We left that way behind.

1200
01:10:02.452 --> 01:10:05.589
You must change, if
not for me, for mother.

1201
01:10:07.490 --> 01:10:10.127
(emotional music)

1202
01:10:14.598 --> 01:10:16.901
(gull cawing)

1203
01:10:26.643 --> 01:10:28.079
Darius?

1204
01:10:28.112 --> 01:10:29.714
I have a favor to ask of you.

1205
01:10:30.848 --> 01:10:31.682
Ask it.

1206
01:10:33.583 --> 01:10:35.753
There's a rabbi
coming to town and...

1207
01:10:35.786 --> 01:10:36.854
You'd like to take the day off

1208
01:10:36.888 --> 01:10:38.723
to hear this rabbi Yeshua teach.

1209
01:10:38.756 --> 01:10:42.660
(chuckles) Yes.

1210
01:10:42.693 --> 01:10:44.594
How did you know?

1211
01:10:44.628 --> 01:10:47.597
Everyone for miles and miles
is going to hear this Yeshua.

1212
01:10:48.531 --> 01:10:50.101
No sales.

1213
01:10:50.134 --> 01:10:51.736
No clients.

1214
01:10:51.769 --> 01:10:52.970
No boats.

1215
01:10:53.004 --> 01:10:54.537
No repairs.

1216
01:10:54.571 --> 01:10:55.605
No fishermen.

1217
01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:57.675
You might as well go.

1218
01:11:00.044 --> 01:11:01.012
You know...

1219
01:11:01.045 --> 01:11:03.180
But you must do me a favor.

1220
01:11:03.214 --> 01:11:04.514
Of course, anything.

1221
01:11:05.249 --> 01:11:06.583
Take Adinah with you.

1222
01:11:07.351 --> 01:11:10.587
I was going to ask you
if I might take her.

1223
01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:11.689
Yes.

1224
01:11:11.722 --> 01:11:12.723
I've seen the way
you've been making

1225
01:11:12.757 --> 01:11:14.058
fish eyes at my daughter.

1226
01:11:15.993 --> 01:11:17.560
I guess she could do worse.

1227
01:11:18.696 --> 01:11:20.430
You two might as
well give it a try.

1228
01:11:21.232 --> 01:11:22.066
Thank you.

1229
01:11:23.566 --> 01:11:24.735
I'll treat her like a queen.

1230
01:11:24.769 --> 01:11:25.602
Ah.

1231
01:11:25.635 --> 01:11:27.504
Just treat her well.

1232
01:11:27.537 --> 01:11:30.540
If you treat her like a queen,
she'll expect it of me too.

1233
01:11:30.573 --> 01:11:31.574
(chuckles)

1234
01:11:31.608 --> 01:11:33.110
I see.

1235
01:11:33.144 --> 01:11:35.512
But do treat her well.

1236
01:11:35.545 --> 01:11:36.613
Yes, I will.

1237
01:11:46.057 --> 01:11:47.825
I'm so excited!

1238
01:11:47.858 --> 01:11:50.061
I never dreamed I'd be
able to see the rabbi.

1239
01:11:51.696 --> 01:11:53.731
It's too difficult getting
out because of my leg.

1240
01:11:53.764 --> 01:11:55.733
If you don't mind me asking...

1241
01:11:55.766 --> 01:11:57.201
My leg?

1242
01:11:57.234 --> 01:11:58.035
Yes.

1243
01:11:58.069 --> 01:11:59.602
Are you in pain?

1244
01:11:59.636 --> 01:12:00.470
Sometimes.

1245
01:12:01.205 --> 01:12:03.506
It's a familiar pain though.

1246
01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:06.844
Been with me since I was born,
so I've grown used to it.

1247
01:12:06.877 --> 01:12:09.680
Now, the looks I get,
those I don't get used to.

1248
01:12:11.115 --> 01:12:14.584
Maybe it's your beauty they
notice, and not the limp.

1249
01:12:21.624 --> 01:12:23.794
I'm afraid I won't be
able to get any closer

1250
01:12:23.828 --> 01:12:24.929
with the cart, Adinah.

1251
01:12:25.763 --> 01:12:26.731
That's all right.

1252
01:12:27.832 --> 01:12:29.133
I'm sure once
everyone gets settled

1253
01:12:29.166 --> 01:12:30.901
I'll be able to
hear him from here.

1254
01:12:32.737 --> 01:12:34.672
Well I could carry you.

1255
01:12:34.705 --> 01:12:35.605
If you'll let me.

1256
01:12:36.273 --> 01:12:37.708
May I?

1257
01:12:37.742 --> 01:12:38.541
Come.

1258
01:12:40.945 --> 01:12:43.580
(soft music)

1259
01:13:08.072 --> 01:13:10.741
(anxious music)

1260
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:27.624
Master?

1261
01:13:30.828 --> 01:13:33.563
You spoke of forgiving
our debts and debtors.

1262
01:13:35.966 --> 01:13:38.669
What of those who have
sinned against us?

1263
01:13:39.737 --> 01:13:40.771
Or against Jehovah?

1264
01:13:43.274 --> 01:13:45.209
Do we forgive them as well?

1265
01:13:47.011 --> 01:13:49.646
(gentle music)

1266
01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:50.815
If you forgive a man

1267
01:13:51.916 --> 01:13:54.351
the sins he has
committed against you,

1268
01:13:54.385 --> 01:13:57.188
then our Father will
also forgive you.

1269
01:13:59.190 --> 01:14:01.358
If you cannot forgive a
man who has wronged you,

1270
01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:07.098
how can you expect our Father
to do the same for you?

1271
01:14:13.838 --> 01:14:18.242
Do not seek the forgiveness
of Jehovah or your fellow man

1272
01:14:18.275 --> 01:14:20.878
without having a
truly penitent heart,

1273
01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:25.316
or you will be
like the hypocrites

1274
01:14:25.349 --> 01:14:28.819
who pray loudly
and without meaning

1275
01:14:30.754 --> 01:14:33.390
so that they may be seen
as righteous among men.

1276
01:14:35.192 --> 01:14:39.063
If you ask Jehovah for something,
He will give it to you.

1277
01:14:41.365 --> 01:14:44.969
If you seek for something,
you will find it.

1278
01:14:46.704 --> 01:14:48.405
If you knock on the
doors of heaven,

1279
01:14:49.940 --> 01:14:51.275
they will be opened to you.

1280
01:14:52.476 --> 01:14:56.380
With faith as small
as a mustard seed,

1281
01:14:57.982 --> 01:15:00.217
you can ask for a
mountain to move...

1282
01:15:01.986 --> 01:15:02.987
and it will be done.

1283
01:15:14.465 --> 01:15:17.301
Adinah, do you remember me?

1284
01:15:17.334 --> 01:15:18.435
Jacob!

1285
01:15:18.469 --> 01:15:19.770
Yes.

1286
01:15:19.803 --> 01:15:21.138
I remember you.

1287
01:15:21.172 --> 01:15:22.306
I thought it was you.

1288
01:15:23.207 --> 01:15:24.308
My Master...

1289
01:15:25.242 --> 01:15:28.345
He saw you, and he sent
me to speak to you.

1290
01:15:28.379 --> 01:15:30.114
Yeshua?

1291
01:15:30.147 --> 01:15:31.749
To us?

1292
01:15:31.782 --> 01:15:33.250
What did he say?

1293
01:15:33.284 --> 01:15:37.454
My Master told me to tell
you that God favors you,

1294
01:15:37.488 --> 01:15:42.092
because you are meek, and the
meek will inherit the earth.

1295
01:15:44.528 --> 01:15:45.763
Brother, no!

1296
01:15:46.430 --> 01:15:48.365
Dismas, what are you doing?

1297
01:15:48.399 --> 01:15:49.767
Stop this.

1298
01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:52.136
It doesn't need to be this way.

1299
01:15:52.169 --> 01:15:53.871
It should never
have been this way.

1300
01:15:53.904 --> 01:15:55.406
This is the way it is.

1301
01:15:56.473 --> 01:15:58.075
This is the way the world works.

1302
01:15:58.742 --> 01:16:00.477
We've never been given anything.

1303
01:16:00.511 --> 01:16:02.446
The only things we have
is what we have stolen,

1304
01:16:02.479 --> 01:16:03.914
and the only things
that we've kept

1305
01:16:03.948 --> 01:16:05.816
is what has not been
stolen back from us.

1306
01:16:05.849 --> 01:16:09.019
You should know that
more than anybody.

1307
01:16:09.053 --> 01:16:10.754
You don't believe that.

1308
01:16:10.788 --> 01:16:12.756
You can't believe that!

1309
01:16:12.790 --> 01:16:16.026
There is another way, the
way that Yeshua speaks of.

1310
01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:16.894
Yeshua?

1311
01:16:18.295 --> 01:16:22.833
Brother, your messiah is
the reason for all of this!

1312
01:16:24.401 --> 01:16:26.303
Don't you remember Bethlehem?

1313
01:16:28.906 --> 01:16:30.908
Don't you remember Aram?

1314
01:16:32.576 --> 01:16:34.411
Don't you remember...

1315
01:16:36.513 --> 01:16:38.816
Mother would have
wanted us to forgive.

1316
01:16:42.586 --> 01:16:45.522
(dramatic music)

1317
01:16:47.524 --> 01:16:49.126
You spit on the memory of her.

1318
01:16:52.930 --> 01:16:56.500
He also told me to tell you
to get up and walk home.

1319
01:16:57.468 --> 01:16:58.502
Rise.

1320
01:16:59.870 --> 01:17:02.506
(emotional music)

1321
01:17:11.282 --> 01:17:16.287
Dismas!

1322
01:17:33.537 --> 01:17:36.273
My brother is always trying
to keep me out of trouble.

1323
01:17:37.508 --> 01:17:39.443
Keep yourself out
of trouble, brother!

1324
01:17:39.476 --> 01:17:40.878
But no, he doesn't.

1325
01:17:40.911 --> 01:17:42.546
He doesn't even come out
to the bar, you know?

1326
01:17:42.579 --> 01:17:45.249
Doesn't drink,
does not let loose.

1327
01:17:45.282 --> 01:17:46.417
I'm not trouble.

1328
01:17:49.453 --> 01:17:52.256
What did you say your name was?

1329
01:18:11.308 --> 01:18:14.044
(dramatic music)

1330
01:18:50.647 --> 01:18:51.982
(groans)

1331
01:18:52.015 --> 01:18:53.117
Don't, don't,
don't please don't!

1332
01:18:53.150 --> 01:18:54.251
Please don't.

1333
01:18:54.284 --> 01:18:55.352
I don't have anything
worth taking.

1334
01:18:56.453 --> 01:18:57.287
Now...

1335
01:19:02.626 --> 01:19:05.562
Why would I do a
thing like that?

1336
01:19:07.498 --> 01:19:08.532
Abba?

1337
01:19:09.734 --> 01:19:12.269
You're not here to avenge Tiran?

1338
01:19:12.302 --> 01:19:13.537
No.

1339
01:19:13.570 --> 01:19:15.139
There were a few men
who wanted revenge,

1340
01:19:15.172 --> 01:19:16.540
but that didn't last.

1341
01:19:16.573 --> 01:19:18.409
The Romans caught up
with us a few days later

1342
01:19:18.442 --> 01:19:21.578
and we had more important
things to worry about.

1343
01:19:21.612 --> 01:19:24.381
So you haven't been
chasing me all these years?

1344
01:19:24.415 --> 01:19:25.215
No.

1345
01:19:25.249 --> 01:19:26.684
No one's hunting you.

1346
01:19:26.718 --> 01:19:29.319
Except that damned
Roman, Longinus.

1347
01:19:29.353 --> 01:19:31.388
I'm sure he'd love to
see you on a cross.

1348
01:19:32.423 --> 01:19:33.691
We'll make camp here tonight.

1349
01:19:35.125 --> 01:19:36.026
You joining us?

1350
01:19:38.696 --> 01:19:39.530
I will.

1351
01:19:43.567 --> 01:19:46.236
(horse neighs)

1352
01:19:59.249 --> 01:20:00.551
I'm glad you agreed
to come with us

1353
01:20:00.584 --> 01:20:03.020
to Jerusalem for Passover.

1354
01:20:03.053 --> 01:20:04.455
Of course.

1355
01:20:04.488 --> 01:20:07.057
I'm honored that you invited me.

1356
01:20:10.260 --> 01:20:13.163
I still can't believe you
haven't seen the city.

1357
01:20:13.197 --> 01:20:14.364
It's wonderful.

1358
01:20:15.365 --> 01:20:16.467
I'm looking forward.

1359
01:20:18.135 --> 01:20:19.570
Good evening, fellow travelers.

1360
01:20:21.673 --> 01:20:23.540
You wouldn't mind us weary men

1361
01:20:23.574 --> 01:20:25.442
sharing your
campsite, would you?

1362
01:20:26.577 --> 01:20:28.579
I'm afraid we would mind.

1363
01:20:28.612 --> 01:20:30.047
It will be too crowded.

1364
01:20:32.382 --> 01:20:35.152
With the few of you and my men?

1365
01:20:35.185 --> 01:20:38.055
There are more of us down
at the water with livestock,

1366
01:20:39.523 --> 01:20:41.158
and the other half of our
caravan is on their way.

1367
01:20:41.191 --> 01:20:43.160
So maybe you should leave.

1368
01:20:43.193 --> 01:20:46.530
Funny, I did not pass
anyone on our ride in.

1369
01:20:47.464 --> 01:20:52.302
Now, why would you lie
to a fellow traveler?

1370
01:20:52.336 --> 01:20:54.371
(dramatic music)

1371
01:20:54.404 --> 01:20:55.439
Teman!

1372
01:20:55.472 --> 01:20:57.474
Easy there, friend.

1373
01:20:57.508 --> 01:21:00.444
No one will get hurt
if you cooperate.

1374
01:21:00.477 --> 01:21:01.813
Take what you want and leave us.

1375
01:21:01.846 --> 01:21:04.248
You don't even want to
talk to an old friend?

1376
01:21:04.281 --> 01:21:06.350
Now, where are your manners?

1377
01:21:06.383 --> 01:21:10.153
Our little family has not
been the same since you left.

1378
01:21:10.187 --> 01:21:12.055
We were never family.

1379
01:21:12.089 --> 01:21:13.524
What's the meaning of this?

1380
01:21:13.557 --> 01:21:15.526
We're all friends.

1381
01:21:15.559 --> 01:21:16.493
No need to worry.

1382
01:21:18.730 --> 01:21:20.097
Look, Barrabas.

1383
01:21:21.331 --> 01:21:22.599
We did not know whose
caravan this was.

1384
01:21:22.633 --> 01:21:24.601
Let's just be on our way.

1385
01:21:26.871 --> 01:21:29.640
(dramatic music)

1386
01:21:32.810 --> 01:21:34.779
(swords clanging)

1387
01:21:34.812 --> 01:21:37.614
(men grunting)

1388
01:21:50.627 --> 01:21:51.628
Jotham!

1389
01:21:53.597 --> 01:21:54.531
No!

1390
01:21:56.567 --> 01:21:57.568
No!

1391
01:22:02.406 --> 01:22:03.206
No!

1392
01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:04.575
I'm sorry!

1393
01:22:04.608 --> 01:22:06.376
He was going to try kill me!

1394
01:22:06.410 --> 01:22:07.244
No!

1395
01:22:10.682 --> 01:22:11.515
Teman!

1396
01:22:12.917 --> 01:22:13.751
No!

1397
01:22:17.454 --> 01:22:20.090
(soft music)

1398
01:22:31.803 --> 01:22:33.671
You've grown careless.

1399
01:22:33.705 --> 01:22:34.839
Perhaps I've just grown tired

1400
01:22:34.872 --> 01:22:37.107
of being two steps ahead of you.

1401
01:22:38.743 --> 01:22:40.745
(sighs)

1402
01:22:44.849 --> 01:22:48.318
The gods must be
smiling on me today.

1403
01:22:49.353 --> 01:22:50.420
I remember you two.

1404
01:22:52.657 --> 01:22:54.324
Arrest these three.

1405
01:22:54.358 --> 01:22:55.727
Leave the bodies for the dogs.

1406
01:23:06.470 --> 01:23:09.239
(crowd shouting)

1407
01:23:14.578 --> 01:23:17.514
(cell door clanging)

1408
01:23:17.547 --> 01:23:19.616
What's happening out there?

1409
01:23:19.650 --> 01:23:20.484
Barrabas went free.

1410
01:23:22.887 --> 01:23:23.821
Went free?

1411
01:23:24.922 --> 01:23:26.623
Apparently your
people fear a prophet

1412
01:23:26.658 --> 01:23:27.759
more than a murderer.

1413
01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:30.494
What about us?

1414
01:23:32.596 --> 01:23:35.332
(dramatic music)

1415
01:23:54.819 --> 01:23:57.587
(chain rattling)

1416
01:24:28.351 --> 01:24:30.822
(whip cracking)

1417
01:25:07.557 --> 01:25:08.558
Jotham of Capernaum.

1418
01:25:08.592 --> 01:25:10.795
Thief and murderer.

1419
01:25:12.596 --> 01:25:14.498
By proclamation
of Pontius Pilate,

1420
01:25:14.531 --> 01:25:16.701
you are to be crucified
for your many crimes

1421
01:25:16.734 --> 01:25:18.368
against the citizens of Rome.

1422
01:25:19.971 --> 01:25:21.471
Dismas of Capernaum.

1423
01:25:21.505 --> 01:25:23.373
Thief and murderer.

1424
01:25:23.406 --> 01:25:25.509
By proclamation
of Pontius Pilate,

1425
01:25:25.542 --> 01:25:28.713
you are to be crucified for
your crimes against Rome.

1426
01:25:28.746 --> 01:25:29.546
(hammering metal nails)

1427
01:25:29.579 --> 01:25:30.782
Yesuah of Nazareth.

1428
01:25:30.815 --> 01:25:33.650
By proclamation
of Pontius Pilate,

1429
01:25:33.684 --> 01:25:36.821
you are to be crucified
for sedition against Rome.

1430
01:25:40.624 --> 01:25:43.694
(emotional vocal music)

1431
01:25:43.728 --> 01:25:44.929
No!

1432
01:25:44.962 --> 01:25:46.630
Please, no!

1433
01:25:46.664 --> 01:25:47.497
My son!

1434
01:25:53.603 --> 01:25:55.907
(bird cawing)

1435
01:26:02.747 --> 01:26:04.548
What have I done?

1436
01:26:11.588 --> 01:26:12.990
What have I done?

1437
01:26:18.528 --> 01:26:20.564
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

1438
01:26:22.967 --> 01:26:24.434
Aren't you the Messiah?

1439
01:26:26.636 --> 01:26:28.072
Save us!

1440
01:26:28.105 --> 01:26:29.073
Save yourself!

1441
01:26:31.676 --> 01:26:33.911
(groaning)

1442
01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:38.749
No angels to come and save us?

1443
01:26:38.783 --> 01:26:39.616
You...

1444
01:26:44.554 --> 01:26:48.092
You never could save
anyone, could you?

1445
01:26:48.125 --> 01:26:50.393
(groans)

1446
01:26:57.134 --> 01:26:58.970
Your savior is a fake!

1447
01:27:05.676 --> 01:27:08.545
We deserve this fate, brother.

1448
01:27:09.512 --> 01:27:10.547
Not him.

1449
01:27:13.050 --> 01:27:14.685
Have mercy on him.

1450
01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:32.602
(birds cawing)

1451
01:27:42.646 --> 01:27:46.150
I'm sorry I didn't
protect you, brother.

1452
01:27:48.652 --> 01:27:49.687
Yeshua...

1453
01:27:50.988 --> 01:27:51.822
Yes?

1454
01:27:54.258 --> 01:27:56.459
I know I deserve this.

1455
01:28:00.998 --> 01:28:03.668
But please forgive me.

1456
01:28:06.636 --> 01:28:07.872
Remember me...

1457
01:28:11.208 --> 01:28:12.509
when you enter...

1458
01:28:13.711 --> 01:28:15.112
into your kingdom.

1459
01:28:18.282 --> 01:28:19.116
Tonight...

1460
01:28:21.686 --> 01:28:22.652
you will be with me...

1461
01:28:26.657 --> 01:28:27.658
in paradise.

1462
01:28:32.163 --> 01:28:34.231
(crying)

1463
01:28:38.568 --> 01:28:39.203
Father...

1464
01:28:43.274 --> 01:28:44.108
it is...

1465
01:28:47.311 --> 01:28:48.145
finished.

1466
01:28:53.184 --> 01:28:54.085
I'm free!

1467
01:28:55.219 --> 01:28:57.688
(coughing)

1468
01:29:02.093 --> 01:29:05.863
