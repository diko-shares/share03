1
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.279
Can you tell me if
Delmar Barry lives here?

2
00:01:49.303 --> 00:01:51.311
Right up there.

3
00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:24.256
Excuse me. Can you tell me,
is this where Delmar Barry lives?

4
00:02:24.537 --> 00:02:26.557
He ain't here.

5
00:02:27.373 --> 00:02:30.276
Go on inside, baby.

6
00:02:34.781 --> 00:02:36.482
He's a friend of mine.

7
00:02:36.483 --> 00:02:40.431
As a matter of fact,
he wrote this address down.

8
00:02:40.455 --> 00:02:42.674
Right here.

9
00:02:42.698 --> 00:02:46.602
There. You can see,
that's Delmar's writing.

10
00:02:46.626 --> 00:02:49.421
I sure had a hard time
finding this place.

11
00:02:49.445 --> 00:02:52.815
- That's his writing.
- Like I said, he's a friend.

12
00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:54.280
My name is John Rambo.

13
00:02:54.304 --> 00:02:57.309
We served on the same
team together in 'Nam.

14
00:02:57.333 --> 00:03:00.217
I don't know if he ever
talked about me.

15
00:03:00.241 --> 00:03:05.079
I've got a picture
of us together...

16
00:03:05.826 --> 00:03:07.524
...somewhere.

17
00:03:07.548 --> 00:03:10.361
This junk in my pocket.

18
00:03:10.385 --> 00:03:12.804
Here... Here it is.
Here it is.

19
00:03:12.828 --> 00:03:16.199
That's me.
That's Danforth and Westmore,

20
00:03:16.223 --> 00:03:19.836
Bronson, Ortega,
and there's Delmar right in the back.

21
00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.253
We had to put him in the back
'cause he's so big.

22
00:03:21.277 --> 00:03:23.498
If we didn't, he'd take up
the whole picture.

23
00:03:23.522 --> 00:03:26.392
- Look how big he is.
- Delmar's gone.

24
00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.800
- What time will he be back?
- He died.

25
00:03:30.824 --> 00:03:32.656
What?

26
00:03:33.082 --> 00:03:35.068
Died last summer.

27
00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.343
Died? How?

28
00:03:38.478 --> 00:03:40.330
Cancer.

29
00:03:40.862 --> 00:03:42.946
Brought it back from 'Nam.

30
00:03:42.983 --> 00:03:46.461
All that orange stuff
they spreaded around.

31
00:03:46.886 --> 00:03:49.399
Cut him down to nothing.

32
00:03:49.423 --> 00:03:52.086
I could lift him off the sheet.

33
00:04:01.267 --> 00:04:03.388
I'm very sorry.

34
00:04:58.925 --> 00:05:01.016
Morning, Annie.
How you doing, girls?

35
00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.629
- Great. Thanks.
- You all right this morning?

36
00:05:06.183 --> 00:05:08.968
- Andy!
- Howdy, Will.

37
00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.359
- Morning, Dave.
- Hi, Sheriff.

38
00:05:23.383 --> 00:05:25.908
Gonna take a bath this week?

39
00:05:33.025 --> 00:05:34.856
Good morning.

40
00:05:38.531 --> 00:05:42.744
You... You visiting
somebody around here?

41
00:05:43.335 --> 00:05:45.115
No.

42
00:05:46.372 --> 00:05:49.309
You know, wearing that flag
on that jacket,

43
00:05:49.333 --> 00:05:51.206
looking the way you do,

44
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.343
you're asking for trouble
around here, friend.

45
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.090
- Headed north or south?
- North.

46
00:05:59.485 --> 00:06:01.545
Jump in.

47
00:06:01.588 --> 00:06:04.558
I'll make sure you're heading
the right direction, hm?

48
00:06:15.986 --> 00:06:18.865
- Where you headed?
- Portland.

49
00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:21.945
Portland is south.
You said you were headed north.

50
00:06:23.126 --> 00:06:25.653
You got some place
I can eat around here?

51
00:06:27.131 --> 00:06:30.121
There's a diner about
30 miles up the highway.

52
00:06:32.136 --> 00:06:34.914
Is there any law against
me getting something here?

53
00:06:34.938 --> 00:06:37.255
Yeah. Me.

54
00:06:38.607 --> 00:06:40.588
Why are you pushing me?

55
00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:43.512
What did you say?

56
00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:47.049
I said, why are you pushing me?
I haven't done anything to you.

57
00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.411
First of all, you don't ask
the questions around here, I do.

58
00:06:49.417 --> 00:06:51.884
You understand? Secondly,

59
00:06:53.724 --> 00:06:56.596
we don't want guys
like you in this town.

60
00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.922
Drifters.

61
00:06:58.946 --> 00:06:59.996
First thing you know,

62
00:06:59.998 --> 00:07:04.061
we got a whole bunch of guys
like you in this town. That's why.

63
00:07:05.215 --> 00:07:06.747
Besides, you wouldn't like it here.

64
00:07:06.771 --> 00:07:11.115
This is...
Is a quiet, little town.

65
00:07:11.842 --> 00:07:14.421
In fact, you might say
it's boring.

66
00:07:14.445 --> 00:07:17.246
But that's the way we like it.

67
00:07:17.781 --> 00:07:20.457
And I get paid
to keep it that way.

68
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:23.329
Boring.

69
00:07:38.869 --> 00:07:41.705
Portland, straight ahead.

70
00:07:42.873 --> 00:07:45.141
Now if you want
some friendly advice,

71
00:07:45.509 --> 00:07:47.904
get a haircut and take a bath.

72
00:07:47.928 --> 00:07:49.902
You wouldn't get hassled so much.

73
00:07:49.926 --> 00:07:52.457
Hope this ride helped you out.

74
00:07:58.472 --> 00:08:00.974
Have a nice day?

75
00:08:38.394 --> 00:08:41.206
Where the hell
you think you're going?

76
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:44.743
Hey, I'm talking to you,
god damn...

77
00:08:49.339 --> 00:08:52.384
Let me see some I.D.
Damn it!

78
00:08:52.408 --> 00:08:54.920
All right. You're under arrest.
You hear me?

79
00:08:54.944 --> 00:08:56.522
Now put your hands on the car.

80
00:08:56.546 --> 00:09:00.023
Now you put your hands
on the car and you spread 'em.

81
00:09:01.495 --> 00:09:04.029
Now you're gonna put
your hands on that car.

82
00:09:04.053 --> 00:09:07.143
How you do it, you decide.
Right now!

83
00:09:19.869 --> 00:09:21.872
Get your legs back.

84
00:09:22.456 --> 00:09:24.174
Get 'em back!

85
00:09:26.276 --> 00:09:29.547
Now, you try to be
nice to some people.

86
00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:36.015
Well, what do we have here?

87
00:09:39.073 --> 00:09:41.941
Why would you be carrying
a knife like this?

88
00:09:42.037 --> 00:09:43.550
Hunting.

89
00:09:44.031 --> 00:09:46.269
Don't be a wise guy.

90
00:09:46.373 --> 00:09:48.551
What do you hunt with a knife?

91
00:09:48.575 --> 00:09:50.909
Name it.

92
00:09:55.582 --> 00:09:58.103
Hi, Will. Lester.

93
00:09:58.127 --> 00:10:00.063
All right, buzz us in, will ya?

94
00:10:00.087 --> 00:10:02.835
Talk about your
sorry-looking humanity.

95
00:10:03.322 --> 00:10:06.042
Just another smart-ass drifter.

96
00:10:07.493 --> 00:10:09.038
Good morning, Arthur.

97
00:10:09.062 --> 00:10:12.426
Morning, Will.
What do ya got?

98
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:14.377
I want you to book this
gentleman for vagrancy,

99
00:10:14.401 --> 00:10:18.647
resisting arrest,
carrying a concealed weapon.

100
00:10:18.671 --> 00:10:21.007
He says he uses it for hunting.

101
00:10:21.031 --> 00:10:23.711
Hunting? What do you hunt?
Elephants?

102
00:10:23.735 --> 00:10:25.877
Why don't you see if you
can clean him up a little bit.

103
00:10:25.878 --> 00:10:28.064
He smells like an animal.

104
00:10:33.219 --> 00:10:36.499
- Hey, Mitch? Mitch?
- You.

105
00:10:36.523 --> 00:10:38.196
Escort this young man
downstairs, would ya?

106
00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:39.751
Yes, sir.

107
00:10:40.075 --> 00:10:42.138
Right this way, partner.

108
00:10:42.162 --> 00:10:45.590
Right here. That's it.

109
00:10:50.871 --> 00:10:53.912
Okay. Here we go.

110
00:10:56.443 --> 00:10:58.609
You know, it looks like
it's going to take ol' Leroy...

111
00:10:58.611 --> 00:11:01.424
...about ten years
to paint this hall.

112
00:11:01.448 --> 00:11:05.479
- Why don't you paint it your damn self?
- Come on, Leroy, sling that paint, boy!

113
00:11:05.685 --> 00:11:07.654
Mr. Ward?

114
00:11:07.787 --> 00:11:09.565
Would you take this
for me, please?

115
00:11:09.589 --> 00:11:11.100
Thank you.

116
00:11:11.124 --> 00:11:13.250
Yeah.

117
00:11:18.498 --> 00:11:20.153
Name?

118
00:11:24.669 --> 00:11:26.405
Your name?

119
00:11:27.689 --> 00:11:29.389
Your name?

120
00:11:34.482 --> 00:11:36.140
Name?

121
00:11:38.451 --> 00:11:41.597
Hey, if you're looking
for trouble,

122
00:11:41.621 --> 00:11:44.096
you came to the right place, buddy.

123
00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:45.732
Wait a second.

124
00:11:46.339 --> 00:11:49.944
Hey, you got three seconds
before I break your face in.

125
00:11:50.405 --> 00:11:51.764
He means it.

126
00:11:51.788 --> 00:11:54.066
Yeah. I do.

127
00:12:12.485 --> 00:12:16.874
What do you know about that?
Ol' Harry here's a soldier.

128
00:12:17.406 --> 00:12:21.560
Rambo... John J.?

129
00:12:23.563 --> 00:12:26.024
You're gonna talk to me.

130
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.649
I promise you're gonna
talk to me, soldier.

131
00:12:31.204 --> 00:12:33.904
I'm starting to dislike you...

132
00:12:35.258 --> 00:12:37.396
...a lot!

133
00:12:38.177 --> 00:12:40.737
I'm gonna run a make on him.

134
00:12:42.464 --> 00:12:44.739
Put his name in the teletype.

135
00:12:45.385 --> 00:12:47.496
Now just roll it across.

136
00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.328
Roll it. Roll it across!

137
00:12:51.358 --> 00:12:52.499
Push it.

138
00:12:52.523 --> 00:12:54.400
It won't work that way.
It'll only smear.

139
00:12:54.402 --> 00:12:56.050
Now roll it across!

140
00:12:56.737 --> 00:12:57.818
Look, you son of a bitch...

141
00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:59.675
...if you don't put your
god damn hand down there,

142
00:12:59.699 --> 00:13:02.912
I'm going to break it off.
Now, put it down, god damn it!

143
00:13:02.936 --> 00:13:05.386
Art, what the hell
is going on down here?

144
00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:07.939
Oh, nothing I can't handle.

145
00:13:08.607 --> 00:13:10.920
He won't let us print him, Will.

146
00:13:10.944 --> 00:13:13.806
Leave the ink on the hand!

147
00:13:14.614 --> 00:13:17.196
Just what is your problem?

148
00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:20.144
Now, listen, hard ass,
as things stand right now,

149
00:13:20.146 --> 00:13:24.783
you're facing the ass end of a 90-day
incarceration, plus a $250 fine,

150
00:13:24.891 --> 00:13:27.325
which you don't look to me
like you can pay.

151
00:13:27.942 --> 00:13:30.773
At 10:00 tomorrow morning,
you're going up in front of that judge.

152
00:13:30.797 --> 00:13:32.687
And you think we're tough.

153
00:13:32.711 --> 00:13:35.015
Now we're gonna make you
a little bit more presentable...

154
00:13:35.018 --> 00:13:37.135
...for your courtroom
appearance.

155
00:13:37.353 --> 00:13:40.090
And between now and then,
you can just impress the hell out of me...

156
00:13:40.114 --> 00:13:43.312
...by doing exactly
as you're told.

157
00:13:48.322 --> 00:13:50.435
Clean him up.

158
00:13:50.782 --> 00:13:52.591
All right, Preston,

159
00:13:52.615 --> 00:13:55.231
I want you to go over there
and get that hose ready.

160
00:13:55.255 --> 00:13:56.924
All right?

161
00:13:59.191 --> 00:14:01.660
Holy shit! Look at this!

162
00:14:01.728 --> 00:14:05.279
- What the hell's he been into?
- Who gives a shit?

163
00:14:05.594 --> 00:14:08.873
All right, put your hands on top
of your head and turn around.

164
00:14:12.322 --> 00:14:14.300
Oh, Christ!

165
00:14:14.324 --> 00:14:17.078
We should report this to Teasle, Galt.
Look at that.

166
00:14:17.102 --> 00:14:20.329
You just do what I tell you.

167
00:14:23.666 --> 00:14:26.335
Galt, what the fuck was that?

168
00:14:26.735 --> 00:14:29.839
Well, the man said clean him up.

169
00:14:32.308 --> 00:14:34.444
Clean him up.

170
00:14:42.551 --> 00:14:44.322
Hey, Preston,

171
00:14:45.094 --> 00:14:48.115
don't forget to get him
behind the ears!

172
00:14:53.769 --> 00:14:55.630
How do you like that?

173
00:14:55.732 --> 00:14:57.451
What's the matter, Mitch?

174
00:14:57.475 --> 00:14:59.996
Don't you like water sports?

175
00:15:07.944 --> 00:15:10.301
Now, hurry it up.
It's time for my coffee break.

176
00:15:10.325 --> 00:15:12.959
- All right, sit down.
- Easy. Sit down.

177
00:15:12.983 --> 00:15:15.648
Sit down.

178
00:15:17.888 --> 00:15:20.435
Come on!

179
00:15:21.456 --> 00:15:25.358
Damn! Damn, this boy's hard
to get a hold of.

180
00:15:26.728 --> 00:15:29.305
It's okay, Ward, don't worry
about the soap. He's tough.

181
00:15:29.329 --> 00:15:32.709
Just shave him, dry.
All right.

182
00:15:33.436 --> 00:15:35.037
How blind are you?

183
00:15:35.235 --> 00:15:36.883
Can't you see this guy's crazy?

184
00:15:36.907 --> 00:15:40.386
- Can't you see I don't give a shit?
- Yeah, I can see that.

185
00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:41.977
Good, that's better.

186
00:15:42.294 --> 00:15:46.380
See there, I knew he knew
what was good for him.

187
00:15:46.404 --> 00:15:48.295
Just gonna shave you, partner.

188
00:15:48.319 --> 00:15:51.763
- Take it easy.
- Take this, Mitch.

189
00:15:55.868 --> 00:15:57.177
Don't move.

190
00:15:57.201 --> 00:15:59.988
I don't want you to
cut your own throat.

191
00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:17.213
You son of a bitch!
Come on!

192
00:16:24.095 --> 00:16:27.449
Get him off of me!
Get him off of me!

193
00:16:35.065 --> 00:16:37.066
What the hell is...

194
00:16:39.469 --> 00:16:41.071
Art?

195
00:16:41.669 --> 00:16:43.126
Art?

196
00:16:44.256 --> 00:16:46.448
What was that?

197
00:16:57.168 --> 00:16:58.752
Hey, you can't...

198
00:17:04.018 --> 00:17:06.049
Hey, hey,
wait a minute. Wait...

199
00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:31.176
- I'm gonna get that son of a bitch!
- No, Art, don't shoot! Art!

200
00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.690
God damn it! Don't shoot.
There's people down there.

201
00:17:33.714 --> 00:17:36.163
All right. get help.
I'll go after him.

202
00:17:36.558 --> 00:17:38.737
Move! Look out!

203
00:17:38.761 --> 00:17:41.296
Get out of the way!
Get out! Get out...

204
00:19:20.745 --> 00:19:22.684
Son of a bitch!

205
00:19:30.705 --> 00:19:32.719
Lester, this is Will.
I'm right on his tail.

206
00:19:32.743 --> 00:19:35.904
He's just east of Smith's farm,
headed towards Chapman Creek.

207
00:20:55.132 --> 00:20:57.487
I know you can hear me!

208
00:20:58.761 --> 00:21:00.943
You're finished!

209
00:21:01.888 --> 00:21:04.499
You've gone as far
as you're gonna go!

210
00:21:06.842 --> 00:21:08.943
You hear me?

211
00:22:14.528 --> 00:22:17.276
Mitch! Lester!

212
00:22:18.294 --> 00:22:21.027
He's up there, beyond the draw.

213
00:22:21.194 --> 00:22:23.505
Mitch, get Orval on the radio.

214
00:22:23.529 --> 00:22:26.799
Tell him to get out here
with his damn dogs right away.

215
00:22:26.823 --> 00:22:29.794
And tell him to bring the Dobermans.
It's gonna rain. We'll need dogs again

216
00:22:29.818 --> 00:22:31.580
- that can hunt on sight.
- Right!

217
00:22:31.604 --> 00:22:33.703
Lester, tell Galt to get out
to the lumber camp.

218
00:22:33.706 --> 00:22:36.166
Tell him to get the helicopter
up here. Right.

219
00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:37.354
If they give him any shit,

220
00:22:37.378 --> 00:22:40.481
tell him to cite them for
obstruction right on the spot!

221
00:22:42.664 --> 00:22:44.342
We'll get him.

222
00:22:45.145 --> 00:22:46.861
No problem.

223
00:23:18.884 --> 00:23:22.221
Come on, Duke.
Thunder, let's get him.

224
00:23:22.421 --> 00:23:24.867
Come on, sweethearts.
That's it, babies.

225
00:23:24.891 --> 00:23:26.869
Let's go get him!

226
00:23:26.893 --> 00:23:28.871
We'll be done in a
couple of hours.

227
00:23:28.895 --> 00:23:32.185
It won't be long before you have
this one stuffed and mounted, Will?

228
00:23:33.483 --> 00:23:35.301
Didn't we go deer hunting
up here last year?

229
00:23:35.325 --> 00:23:36.879
Yeah. I got a couple
bucks last year.

230
00:23:36.903 --> 00:23:38.184
I'll shoot anything.

231
00:23:38.208 --> 00:23:40.680
Hey, Mitch, up the hill.

232
00:24:00.291 --> 00:24:01.971
Keep those dogs
away from me, Orval.

233
00:24:01.995 --> 00:24:03.889
I don't trust those bastards.

234
00:24:03.913 --> 00:24:05.326
Keep moving, 'cause my dogs

235
00:24:05.329 --> 00:24:07.624
can eat and run
at the same time.

236
00:24:08.001 --> 00:24:10.265
He's heading straight
for the top.

237
00:24:10.503 --> 00:24:14.228
Is this guy supposed to be dangerous?
He's just dumb.

238
00:24:30.142 --> 00:24:32.149
Hey, Walt, you're spoiling
the scent.

239
00:24:32.173 --> 00:24:35.150
- Let my babies do the job.
- Go ahead.

240
00:24:35.594 --> 00:24:37.529
I'm trailing you here.

241
00:24:37.697 --> 00:24:40.365
- This is no good.
- Why?

242
00:24:40.439 --> 00:24:42.466
There were three of us on
him in the cell block down there.

243
00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:45.337
He went through us
like we weren't even there.

244
00:24:46.348 --> 00:24:48.182
Aw, come on.

245
00:25:19.405 --> 00:25:21.417
Let's go, babies.
Come on, Duke.

246
00:25:21.441 --> 00:25:24.372
Okay, Thunder.

247
00:25:59.779 --> 00:26:01.859
Come on, Duke.
We got him cornered.

248
00:26:01.883 --> 00:26:05.426
Art? Art, this is Teasle.
He's headed for Chapman Gorge.

249
00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:07.882
Chapman Gorge. Head him off.

250
00:26:21.934 --> 00:26:24.603
God! No!

251
00:26:42.554 --> 00:26:44.743
There he is! On the cliff!

252
00:27:01.606 --> 00:27:03.939
Son of a bitch!

253
00:27:11.349 --> 00:27:12.594
What the hell's going on?

254
00:27:12.618 --> 00:27:15.435
What are you doing?
We're just supposed to spot him.

255
00:27:15.459 --> 00:27:17.096
Hold it steady.

256
00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.742
I can't!
We're in a thermal draft.

257
00:27:19.766 --> 00:27:23.487
Jesus, Galt, he's stuck there.
He can't go any place.

258
00:27:23.862 --> 00:27:26.748
If you don't fly the thing right,

259
00:27:26.772 --> 00:27:30.042
I swear to God,
I'm gonna kill you.

260
00:27:31.353 --> 00:27:33.593
Sheriff to Galt. Come in Galt.

261
00:27:38.159 --> 00:27:40.125
Hold it steady,
you son of a bitch!

262
00:27:40.149 --> 00:27:42.481
Galt, come in, god damn it!

263
00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:45.361
Get in closer,
and hold it steady.

264
00:27:45.385 --> 00:27:48.726
Galt, talk to me, dammit!
I want to know what's going on!

265
00:27:51.256 --> 00:27:54.069
I got him.
Easy. Easy.

266
00:28:22.492 --> 00:28:24.222
Jesus!

267
00:28:39.537 --> 00:28:40.848
There he is!

268
00:28:40.872 --> 00:28:43.946
He's over there, dummy!
Come on!

269
00:28:45.176 --> 00:28:46.876
Go on!

270
00:28:48.147 --> 00:28:50.742
Hey, soldier boy!

271
00:28:55.588 --> 00:28:57.890
Move it!
Move it down the side!

272
00:29:02.853 --> 00:29:05.023
Hold it steady!

273
00:29:05.631 --> 00:29:07.466
Come on!

274
00:29:10.136 --> 00:29:14.663
Galt, I'm telling you to get on this radio!
What's going on up there?

275
00:29:16.708 --> 00:29:19.770
I don't want him dead, Galt!
I want him alive! You hear me?

276
00:29:19.794 --> 00:29:21.727
Art, come in!

277
00:29:21.922 --> 00:29:23.743
Watch out!

278
00:30:19.287 --> 00:30:23.049
Art Galt, come in.
Helicopter, come in, god damn it!

279
00:30:23.073 --> 00:30:25.502
Christ! Look!

280
00:30:28.404 --> 00:30:32.053
Jesus Christ.
Give me the binoculars, hurry.

281
00:30:32.435 --> 00:30:36.147
Oh, no! Shit!

282
00:30:41.293 --> 00:30:43.326
Jesus Christ.

283
00:31:21.298 --> 00:31:23.361
I can't figure it.

284
00:31:23.385 --> 00:31:25.109
How'd he fall out?

285
00:31:25.714 --> 00:31:26.944
Does it matter?

286
00:31:26.968 --> 00:31:29.786
Let's nail this sucker's ass.
He can't be far.

287
00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:31.423
Will!

288
00:31:33.327 --> 00:31:36.096
Looks like he wants
to turn himself in.

289
00:31:37.899 --> 00:31:40.160
There's one man dead!

290
00:31:40.493 --> 00:31:44.348
It's not my fault!
I don't want any more hurt!

291
00:31:44.372 --> 00:31:46.050
Freeze!

292
00:31:46.074 --> 00:31:48.927
Stand right where you are!
Give yourself up!

293
00:31:48.951 --> 00:31:50.965
But I didn't do anything!

294
00:31:50.989 --> 00:31:54.108
I'm warning you boy, don't make a move!
I'll blow your head off!

295
00:31:54.132 --> 00:31:56.568
I didn't do anything!

296
00:32:01.422 --> 00:32:04.193
Cease fire! Cease fire!

297
00:32:04.425 --> 00:32:07.261
Ward, god damn it, cease fire!

298
00:32:08.044 --> 00:32:09.606
I think we hit him.

299
00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:12.121
Let's get down there.
Move!

300
00:32:13.593 --> 00:32:15.744
Sheriff to base. Come in.

301
00:32:19.264 --> 00:32:20.444
Go ahead, Will.

302
00:32:20.468 --> 00:32:23.339
Lester, we're down in the gorge.

303
00:32:23.911 --> 00:32:26.914
Galt's dead all right. Where the
hell is that god damn chopper?

304
00:32:26.938 --> 00:32:30.528
He won't come, Will.
Says there's a storm headed your way.

305
00:32:30.552 --> 00:32:34.832
I don't give a god damn what's on its way!
I want that chopper back here right now!

306
00:32:34.856 --> 00:32:36.729
I don't want Galt's body
out here all night.

307
00:32:36.753 --> 00:32:38.103
I'll do what I can.
Listen Will,

308
00:32:38.127 --> 00:32:40.584
you sure picked one hell of a guy
to mess around with.

309
00:32:40.591 --> 00:32:42.464
This came over the teletype
a few minutes ago,

310
00:32:42.488 --> 00:32:44.893
John Rambo is a Vietnam Vet.

311
00:32:44.917 --> 00:32:49.339
He's a Green Beret. Congressional
Medal of Honour. Guy's a war hero.

312
00:32:49.344 --> 00:32:50.444
Jesus, that freak?

313
00:32:50.468 --> 00:32:53.230
I knew there was something
about that guy.

314
00:32:53.608 --> 00:32:55.370
I double-checked it, Will.

315
00:32:55.394 --> 00:32:57.316
What do you want me to do?

316
00:33:01.949 --> 00:33:04.022
I want you to do
what I told you to do, god damn it!

317
00:33:04.024 --> 00:33:06.543
Get that chopper
back here now! Out!

318
00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:13.933
Green Beret. War hero.

319
00:33:14.329 --> 00:33:17.809
- That's great. That's just great.
- Why don't you shut your mouth?

320
00:33:17.833 --> 00:33:19.867
Now what the hell's
the matter with you guys?

321
00:33:19.874 --> 00:33:22.572
He's one man.
He's wounded.

322
00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:26.750
Those Green Berets,
they're real bad asses.

323
00:33:26.774 --> 00:33:29.210
Why don't you let the
state police handle this?

324
00:33:33.713 --> 00:33:36.502
Come here, boy.
Come here, god damn it!

325
00:33:37.225 --> 00:33:41.165
Look at him! Look at him!
It's Art Galt, boy.

326
00:33:41.189 --> 00:33:45.460
He and I were friends when your
mama was still wiping your nose!

327
00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:49.097
Now he's dead. He's dead because
of that psycho out there!

328
00:33:49.102 --> 00:33:50.729
Now you listen boy
and you listen to me good.

329
00:33:50.733 --> 00:33:52.842
I'm gonna get
that son of a bitch!

330
00:33:52.866 --> 00:33:56.804
And I'm gonna pin that Congressional
Medal of Honour to his liver.

331
00:33:56.829 --> 00:34:01.541
And I'm gonna do it
with you or without you.

332
00:34:15.469 --> 00:34:17.297
My ankle!

333
00:34:19.659 --> 00:34:22.540
We're closing in.
The scent's getting stronger.

334
00:34:22.564 --> 00:34:24.702
All right, keep your eyes open.

335
00:34:25.267 --> 00:34:27.501
Come on, baby. Let's go.

336
00:34:27.769 --> 00:34:31.092
It's gonna storm.
That's all we need now.

337
00:34:31.116 --> 00:34:33.936
Will, come on, let's get out of here
before it gets too dark.

338
00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:36.094
What's the matter?
You afraid of the bogeyman?

339
00:34:36.118 --> 00:34:38.066
You god damn pansy.

340
00:34:38.146 --> 00:34:40.432
Ward, put your gun down.
I'll show you who the pansy is.

341
00:34:40.456 --> 00:34:42.327
Okay, come on down!

342
00:34:42.351 --> 00:34:44.496
Hey, guys, knock it off!

343
00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:47.210
Ward, move on!
The fight is out there!

344
00:34:47.212 --> 00:34:48.900
He's out there waiting for you!

345
00:34:48.924 --> 00:34:52.159
Mitch, get on your feet.
Get on your feet and move!

346
00:34:52.194 --> 00:34:54.522
Let's go find this guy,
for Christ's sake! Come on!

347
00:34:54.546 --> 00:34:56.508
- Keep your eyes open!
- Come on there, Duke!

348
00:34:56.532 --> 00:34:58.759
I'll see you later, Ward!

349
00:34:58.783 --> 00:35:00.795
Shut up, Mitch!

350
00:35:04.773 --> 00:35:06.707
Let's go, girl. Come on.

351
00:35:08.426 --> 00:35:09.786
There he is!

352
00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:12.539
Turn them loose!
Turn those dogs loose, Orval!

353
00:35:12.563 --> 00:35:15.796
Go get 'em, sweethearts!
There's your dinner!

354
00:35:26.249 --> 00:35:28.486
Cease fire! Cease fire!

355
00:35:30.899 --> 00:35:34.169
I'm hit!
God damn it, I'm hit!

356
00:35:35.627 --> 00:35:37.291
Jesus.

357
00:35:38.095 --> 00:35:40.100
He's got a gun.

358
00:35:47.648 --> 00:35:51.018
It's not him!
It's a god damn scarecrow!

359
00:35:51.042 --> 00:35:54.799
It was no scarecrow that shot Orval!
He's close! He's real close!

360
00:35:54.823 --> 00:35:59.132
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!
Go get him!

361
00:35:59.156 --> 00:36:01.129
Go get him, Maggie!

362
00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:12.306
Mitch!

363
00:36:12.981 --> 00:36:15.019
Mitch, Ward, come here.

364
00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:18.790
- Shingleton, you cover us.
- Look at his leg.

365
00:36:18.814 --> 00:36:21.592
Mitch, get your belt off.
Get a tourniquet around that.

366
00:36:21.616 --> 00:36:25.052
- We gotta get this guy to a doctor, Will!
- God damn it! Get your belt on there fast!

367
00:36:25.054 --> 00:36:27.203
- Where's the first aid kit?
- I left it in the car.

368
00:36:27.227 --> 00:36:29.366
Shit!
Where'd he get the gun?

369
00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:31.159
It's got to be Art Galt's gun.

370
00:36:31.183 --> 00:36:33.277
- He's out of ammo.
- How do you know that?

371
00:36:33.294 --> 00:36:35.327
Because whatever killed
that last dog was no bullet!

372
00:36:35.330 --> 00:36:37.708
That's how! Hurry up!

373
00:36:37.732 --> 00:36:41.052
Orval, listen to me. Now listen.
You got to stay awake, all right?

374
00:36:41.076 --> 00:36:44.596
You got to release that tourniquet
every 15 minutes. We'll be right back!

375
00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:46.474
We got to get him now.
He's out of ammo.

376
00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:48.970
Hurry up! Move! He had
no right to shoot my babies.

377
00:36:48.994 --> 00:36:50.499
- Come on!
- Get the son of a bitch!

378
00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:52.937
- Let's go!
- Go get him!

379
00:36:53.348 --> 00:36:56.482
All right. All right.
Now, listen up.

380
00:36:56.851 --> 00:37:00.097
We're right on top of him. We're gonna
form a skirmish line 50 feet apart.

381
00:37:00.121 --> 00:37:03.476
And keep moving. There's no way
out of here except through us.

382
00:37:05.961 --> 00:37:07.244
Okay.

383
00:37:07.268 --> 00:37:09.106
Let's do some hunting.

384
00:37:09.130 --> 00:37:10.208
Hunting?

385
00:37:10.232 --> 00:37:13.127
We ain't hunting him.
He's hunting us.

386
00:37:26.982 --> 00:37:29.126
Spread out!
Spread out, damn it!

387
00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:30.915
I said 50 feet!

388
00:37:51.297 --> 00:37:52.921
Damn!

389
00:37:54.941 --> 00:37:57.179
God, I hate this!

390
00:39:08.309 --> 00:39:10.080
God!

391
00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:14.032
- Will, it's Mitch!
- Oh, shit, Will!

392
00:39:14.056 --> 00:39:16.344
Oh, God!

393
00:39:16.368 --> 00:39:18.047
Will!

394
00:39:18.727 --> 00:39:21.922
- Who is it?
- Will!

395
00:39:22.398 --> 00:39:25.474
Will!

396
00:39:34.309 --> 00:39:35.900
Mitch?

397
00:39:49.523 --> 00:39:51.784
- What the hell's going on?
- Shut up!

398
00:39:53.846 --> 00:39:56.298
- Will, he's here!
- He's got Ward.

399
00:39:56.322 --> 00:39:58.717
All right, spread out!
I'll go this way.

400
00:39:59.119 --> 00:40:00.411
Will!

401
00:40:00.435 --> 00:40:02.089
Will!

402
00:40:04.738 --> 00:40:06.361
Will!

403
00:40:07.409 --> 00:40:08.927
Over here!

404
00:40:08.951 --> 00:40:11.808
Will! He's over here!

405
00:40:13.355 --> 00:40:15.065
Who fired?

406
00:40:15.791 --> 00:40:19.396
- Who the hell is firing?
- I got him! I got him!

407
00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:21.529
Shingleton, follow me!

408
00:40:22.364 --> 00:40:24.113
I got him!

409
00:40:25.761 --> 00:40:30.620
Somebody help me!
Help me, Will!

410
00:40:31.131 --> 00:40:33.626
Will! Balford?

411
00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:37.835
- Balford, where the hell are ya?
- Will!

412
00:40:39.456 --> 00:40:41.038
Help!

413
00:40:42.395 --> 00:40:45.372
- Help me!
- Balford?

414
00:40:49.851 --> 00:40:51.938
Shingleton, over here!

415
00:40:54.279 --> 00:40:55.600
God. Jesus.

416
00:40:55.624 --> 00:40:58.057
- Easy. Easy.
- Get me out of here.

417
00:40:58.413 --> 00:41:00.156
All right. Hold it.

418
00:41:04.797 --> 00:41:07.089
Jesus Christ!

419
00:41:07.893 --> 00:41:10.288
Shingleton,
where the hell are ya?

420
00:41:13.465 --> 00:41:15.289
Shingleton?

421
00:41:17.495 --> 00:41:19.284
Shingleton?

422
00:41:20.048 --> 00:41:21.978
Will!

423
00:41:23.617 --> 00:41:25.456
Will!

424
00:41:26.777 --> 00:41:28.505
Jesus Christ!

425
00:41:28.529 --> 00:41:30.064
Jesus...

426
00:41:33.335 --> 00:41:35.306
I could've killed them all.

427
00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:37.642
I could have killed you.

428
00:41:37.666 --> 00:41:41.301
In town, you're the law.
Out here, it's me.

429
00:41:41.369 --> 00:41:43.303
Don't push it!

430
00:41:43.671 --> 00:41:47.104
Don't push it, or I'll give you
a war you won't believe.

431
00:41:49.577 --> 00:41:51.546
Let it go!

432
00:41:52.213 --> 00:41:54.912
Let it go!

433
00:42:33.922 --> 00:42:36.031
All right. Coming in.

434
00:42:41.497 --> 00:42:45.799
- Come on. Get back.
- Move back, you guys. Move back.

435
00:42:55.744 --> 00:42:58.289
Captain, can we have a comment
on what's happening?

436
00:42:58.313 --> 00:43:01.216
- How bad is the situation?
- Captain, we need some...

437
00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:02.728
Only good thing
to come out of this mess

438
00:43:02.752 --> 00:43:04.964
is the business
we're doing in town.

439
00:43:04.988 --> 00:43:07.728
Reporters are drinking
the place dry.

440
00:43:10.224 --> 00:43:13.118
You look like you're ready
to keel over, Will.

441
00:43:13.142 --> 00:43:15.564
Why don't you go home?
It's my problem now.

442
00:43:15.588 --> 00:43:17.408
Your problem? Listen, Dave,

443
00:43:17.432 --> 00:43:21.412
don't give me any of your horseshit about
jurisdiction on this one, you understand?

444
00:43:21.436 --> 00:43:24.793
- Would you like me to step outside?
- Just finish up what you're doing.

445
00:43:25.406 --> 00:43:27.418
Somewhere in this rugged
mountain countryside,

446
00:43:27.442 --> 00:43:30.755
possibly above the snow line,
shrouded in mist,

447
00:43:30.779 --> 00:43:33.424
the fugitive John Rambo is hiding.

448
00:43:33.448 --> 00:43:37.146
Units of the state police, along with
local members of the National Guard

449
00:43:37.170 --> 00:43:39.054
are now being mobilized.

450
00:43:39.078 --> 00:43:41.655
What still remains unexplained
by local authorities

451
00:43:41.659 --> 00:43:44.228
is just how and where
the former Green Beret

452
00:43:44.458 --> 00:43:46.703
came into possession
of the weapons with which...

453
00:43:46.727 --> 00:43:48.730
...he allegedly killed
one deputy sheriff...

454
00:43:48.754 --> 00:43:50.441
...and tried to kill six others.

455
00:43:50.465 --> 00:43:54.361
Only their skilled training in police
enforcement techniques saved their lives.

456
00:43:54.385 --> 00:43:58.972
And word now is that the fugitive
will be in custody in a matter of hours.

457
00:44:00.173 --> 00:44:01.741
Here's the map, Will.

458
00:44:02.883 --> 00:44:05.621
Will, there's something
I think you ought to know.

459
00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:08.168
Talk to you later. Okay?

460
00:44:08.192 --> 00:44:11.172
What is it, Lester? What is it?
For Chrissake's, spit it out!

461
00:44:13.052 --> 00:44:16.095
Well, I was...
I was just talking to Mitch,

462
00:44:16.122 --> 00:44:19.194
and he was saying that Galt
and a couple deputies were

463
00:44:20.157 --> 00:44:23.132
- a little hard on the guy.
- Assholes!

464
00:44:23.156 --> 00:44:27.846
Doesn't make one god damn bit
of difference, Dave and you know it!

465
00:44:28.169 --> 00:44:30.604
Look, if one of my deputies

466
00:44:31.504 --> 00:44:32.921
gets out of line
with a prisoner,

467
00:44:32.924 --> 00:44:34.785
then the prisoner
comes to me with it!

468
00:44:34.809 --> 00:44:37.322
And if I find out it's like he says,
I kick the deputy's ass!

469
00:44:37.346 --> 00:44:40.912
Me, the law!
That's the way it's got to be!

470
00:44:41.681 --> 00:44:43.451
People start fucking
around with the law

471
00:44:43.454 --> 00:44:45.866
and all hell breaks loose!

472
00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:51.126
Whatever possessed God in heaven
to make a man like Rambo?

473
00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:53.385
God didn't make Rambo.

474
00:44:54.028 --> 00:44:57.030
- I made him.
- Who the hell are you?

475
00:44:57.131 --> 00:45:00.627
Sam Trautman.
Colonel Samuel Trautman.

476
00:45:00.651 --> 00:45:02.539
Look, we're a little busy
this morning, Colonel.

477
00:45:02.541 --> 00:45:03.595
What can I do for you?

478
00:45:03.597 --> 00:45:05.971
- I've come to get my boy.
- Your boy?

479
00:45:05.995 --> 00:45:08.020
I recruited him.
I trained him.

480
00:45:08.044 --> 00:45:10.852
I commanded him in
Vietnam for 3 years.

481
00:45:11.111 --> 00:45:12.939
I'd say that makes him mine.

482
00:45:12.963 --> 00:45:15.352
I wonder why the Pentagon would

483
00:45:15.376 --> 00:45:18.569
send a full-bird colonel
down here to handle this.

484
00:45:18.593 --> 00:45:20.853
The Army thought
I might be able to help.

485
00:45:20.877 --> 00:45:25.122
I don't know in what way.
Rambo's a civilian now. He's my problem.

486
00:45:25.601 --> 00:45:27.602
I don't think you understand.

487
00:45:27.626 --> 00:45:30.386
I didn't come here
to rescue Rambo from you.

488
00:45:30.398 --> 00:45:33.124
I came here
to rescue you from him.

489
00:45:33.973 --> 00:45:37.004
Well, we all appreciate
your concern, Colonel.

490
00:45:37.028 --> 00:45:39.183
I will try to be extra careful.

491
00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:42.820
I'm just amazed that he allowed
any of your posse to live.

492
00:45:42.844 --> 00:45:44.323
Is that right?

493
00:45:44.347 --> 00:45:48.095
Strictly speaking, he slipped up.
You're lucky to be breathing.

494
00:45:48.119 --> 00:45:50.158
That's just great!

495
00:45:50.408 --> 00:45:52.055
Colonel, you came out
here to find out

496
00:45:52.057 --> 00:45:54.257
why one of your machines
blew a gasket.

497
00:45:54.258 --> 00:45:56.254
You don't seem to want
to accept the fact

498
00:45:56.257 --> 00:45:59.526
that you're dealing with an
expert in guerrilla warfare.

499
00:45:59.709 --> 00:46:01.245
With a man who's the best

500
00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:04.800
with guns, with knives,
with his bare hands.

501
00:46:04.824 --> 00:46:07.377
A man who's been trained
to ignore pain,

502
00:46:07.401 --> 00:46:11.260
ignore weather,
to live off the land,

503
00:46:11.521 --> 00:46:14.340
to eat things that would make
a billy goat puke.

504
00:46:14.375 --> 00:46:17.610
In Vietnam, his job was to
dispose of enemy personnel.

505
00:46:17.634 --> 00:46:20.339
To kill. Period.

506
00:46:20.363 --> 00:46:22.466
Win by attrition.

507
00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:24.970
Well, Rambo was the best.

508
00:47:20.607 --> 00:47:22.787
Okay, Colonel, now you got
us all scared to death.

509
00:47:22.793 --> 00:47:25.528
What do you and the Special
Forces think I ought to do

510
00:47:25.531 --> 00:47:28.364
about your psycho out there?

511
00:47:28.886 --> 00:47:30.376
Let him go.

512
00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:32.873
- Do what?
- For now.

513
00:47:33.121 --> 00:47:35.742
Diffuse the whole situation.
Diffuse him.

514
00:47:35.757 --> 00:47:38.569
Provide a little gap
and let him slip through it.

515
00:47:38.593 --> 00:47:40.772
Then put out
a nationwide A.P.B.

516
00:47:40.775 --> 00:47:41.804
In a couple of weeks,

517
00:47:41.806 --> 00:47:43.951
you'll pick him up in Seattle or some place,
working in a car wash.

518
00:47:43.956 --> 00:47:45.925
There'll be no fight
and nobody else will get hurt.

519
00:47:45.949 --> 00:47:47.120
I do my own work.

520
00:47:47.144 --> 00:47:49.275
I don't figure the best
way to do that is to close

521
00:47:49.277 --> 00:47:51.689
my eyes and then hope
he gets picked up in Seattle.

522
00:47:51.692 --> 00:47:54.100
Well, if you send your people in there
after him, they'll get killed.

523
00:47:54.124 --> 00:47:57.594
You know, we're just a small,
hick town sheriff's department, Colonel,

524
00:47:57.596 --> 00:47:59.031
but we're expected
to do our duty

525
00:47:59.034 --> 00:48:01.523
just like our heroes
in the Special Forces.

526
00:48:01.547 --> 00:48:04.751
In Special Forces, we teach our
people to stay alive in the line of duty.

527
00:48:04.768 --> 00:48:07.884
- No shit! I never thought of that.
- You want a war you can't win?

528
00:48:07.889 --> 00:48:12.224
Are you telling me that 200 men against
your boy is a no-win situation for us?

529
00:48:12.242 --> 00:48:14.205
You send that many,
don't forget one thing.

530
00:48:14.229 --> 00:48:17.836
- What?
- A good supply of body bags.

531
00:48:20.675 --> 00:48:22.201
Trautman!

532
00:48:24.287 --> 00:48:26.983
I don't know which side
you're on, Trautman.

533
00:48:27.007 --> 00:48:29.932
I still think you came out
here just to cover your ass.

534
00:48:30.077 --> 00:48:34.262
But if you're serious about taking
Rambo out clean, follow me.

535
00:48:54.784 --> 00:48:58.503
State Police calling John Rambo.
Acknowledge.

536
00:49:04.812 --> 00:49:07.109
State Police calling John Rambo.

537
00:49:07.112 --> 00:49:10.047
Come in, please. Acknowledge.

538
00:49:11.734 --> 00:49:14.280
If you're listening, Rambo,
here is your situation.

539
00:49:14.304 --> 00:49:15.724
You are surrounded.

540
00:49:15.748 --> 00:49:18.396
Every possible exit
has been blocked.

541
00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:21.377
Every highway, every road,
every firebreak.

542
00:49:21.387 --> 00:49:23.291
You have our word that
your services to your country

543
00:49:23.315 --> 00:49:24.952
will be taken into consideration,

544
00:49:24.956 --> 00:49:27.036
and you will receive
fair treatment.

545
00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:30.062
Just respond. We can work
everything out. Over.

546
00:49:30.086 --> 00:49:31.722
Anything?

547
00:49:32.427 --> 00:49:34.395
He took a radio off
one of my deputies.

548
00:49:34.419 --> 00:49:36.113
Then he has to be listening.

549
00:49:36.137 --> 00:49:38.749
If I was in his position,
I'd try to pick up some information.

550
00:49:38.773 --> 00:49:41.469
- Maybe catch some cross talk.
- Of course he's listening.

551
00:49:41.481 --> 00:49:44.734
- He's not gonna break radio silence.
- No. Not for us.

552
00:49:44.737 --> 00:49:47.043
But he might do it
for you, Colonel.

553
00:49:47.228 --> 00:49:48.795
He's your boy, isn't he?

554
00:49:51.018 --> 00:49:53.595
Maybe you can talk him
into sparing all our lives

555
00:49:53.619 --> 00:49:55.810
by giving himself up.

556
00:49:55.971 --> 00:49:57.640
I can try.

557
00:49:57.664 --> 00:49:59.751
At least, we'll get
a radio fix on his position,

558
00:49:59.775 --> 00:50:01.554
if you don't mind
setting him up for us.

559
00:50:01.578 --> 00:50:03.263
Setting him up for you?

560
00:50:03.363 --> 00:50:06.129
That's like bringing
the pigeons to the cat.

561
00:50:07.549 --> 00:50:09.825
Son of a bitch.

562
00:50:10.452 --> 00:50:11.490
Hey, Don.

563
00:50:11.514 --> 00:50:14.145
Thanks for bringing your
people out. Any time, Will.

564
00:50:14.169 --> 00:50:16.968
Come on, Bobby put the magazine away,
will ya? Pay attention.

565
00:50:16.992 --> 00:50:19.290
We may only get
one crack at this.

566
00:50:23.765 --> 00:50:27.543
Covey Leader calling Raven.
Come on, Raven.

567
00:50:29.571 --> 00:50:31.992
Covey Leader calling Raven.

568
00:50:35.744 --> 00:50:39.275
Covey Leader to Raven.
Talk to me, Johnny.

569
00:50:40.883 --> 00:50:43.931
Covey Leader
to identify Baker Team.

570
00:50:44.019 --> 00:50:46.064
Rambo, Messner,

571
00:50:46.088 --> 00:50:48.756
Ortega, Coletta,

572
00:50:48.924 --> 00:50:51.058
Jorgensen, Danforth,

573
00:50:51.553 --> 00:50:55.906
Barry, Krackauer. Confirm.

574
00:50:55.931 --> 00:50:58.166
This is Col. Trautman.

575
00:50:59.734 --> 00:51:01.697
Talk to me, Johnny.

576
00:51:15.350 --> 00:51:17.050
They're all gone, sir.

577
00:51:17.074 --> 00:51:19.269
It's him.
It's him. Get on it.

578
00:51:19.688 --> 00:51:22.144
Rambo, are you all right? Over.

579
00:51:22.168 --> 00:51:24.139
Baker Team,
they're all dead, sir.

580
00:51:24.759 --> 00:51:27.945
Not Delmar Barry.
He made it.

581
00:51:28.429 --> 00:51:30.569
Barry's gone too, sir.

582
00:51:30.932 --> 00:51:32.661
How?

583
00:51:33.068 --> 00:51:36.229
Got himself killed in 'Nam.
Didn't even know it.

584
00:51:36.253 --> 00:51:38.532
Cancer ate him down to the bone.

585
00:51:39.774 --> 00:51:41.583
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

586
00:51:42.643 --> 00:51:44.746
I'm the last one, sir.

587
00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:48.922
It's good to hear your voice, Johnny.
It's been a long time.

588
00:51:50.115 --> 00:51:52.469
Look, John, you've done some
damage here. That's it. Northwest.

589
00:51:52.493 --> 00:51:54.082
...but they don't
want any more trouble.

590
00:51:54.106 --> 00:51:55.846
He's north west.

591
00:51:55.924 --> 00:51:57.731
That's why I've come.

592
00:51:58.059 --> 00:52:00.016
I'm gonna come in there
and fly you the hell out.

593
00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:02.846
Just you and me.
We'll work this thing out together.

594
00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:04.717
Is that fair enough?

595
00:52:05.266 --> 00:52:07.044
Where'd you come from, sir?

596
00:52:07.068 --> 00:52:08.801
Bragg.

597
00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:10.740
I tried to get in touch with you,

598
00:52:10.741 --> 00:52:13.141
but the guys at Bragg never
knew where to find you.

599
00:52:13.142 --> 00:52:15.461
Yeah, well, I haven't been spending
much time there lately.

600
00:52:15.485 --> 00:52:18.989
They've got me down in D.C.
I'm shining a seat with my ass.

601
00:52:19.013 --> 00:52:21.657
I wish I was back at Bragg now.

602
00:52:24.019 --> 00:52:26.030
We'll talk about that
when you come in.

603
00:52:26.054 --> 00:52:28.156
I can't do that, sir.

604
00:52:30.658 --> 00:52:33.161
Well look, John, we can't have
you running around out there

605
00:52:33.185 --> 00:52:36.574
- wasting friendly civilians.
- There are no friendly civilians.

606
00:52:36.598 --> 00:52:38.765
Well, I'm your friend, Johnny.

607
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:42.213
I was there with you knee-deep
in all that blood and guts.

608
00:52:42.237 --> 00:52:44.644
I covered your ass
more than once.

609
00:52:47.075 --> 00:52:50.465
Seems like bailing you out of trouble
is getting to be a lifetime job for me.

610
00:52:50.489 --> 00:52:53.824
There wouldn't be no trouble
except for that king-shit cop.

611
00:52:53.848 --> 00:52:56.408
All I wanted
was something to eat,

612
00:52:56.785 --> 00:52:59.273
but the man kept pushing, sir.

613
00:52:59.654 --> 00:53:02.084
Well, you did some pushing
of your own, John.

614
00:53:02.523 --> 00:53:04.567
They drew first blood, not me.

615
00:53:04.591 --> 00:53:05.729
Look, Johnny,

616
00:53:05.753 --> 00:53:08.665
let me come in
and get you the hell out of there.

617
00:53:10.030 --> 00:53:12.211
They drew first blood.

618
00:53:20.241 --> 00:53:21.800
Rambo!

619
00:53:22.132 --> 00:53:23.936
Are you still reading me?

620
00:53:27.783 --> 00:53:29.821
Covey Leader to Raven.

621
00:53:30.918 --> 00:53:32.981
Rambo, acknowledge.

622
00:53:33.654 --> 00:53:35.725
He's all finished, Colonel.

623
00:53:36.257 --> 00:53:38.435
We've got a real good
fix on him, though.

624
00:53:38.459 --> 00:53:41.490
Come first light, I'm gonna put
every man I got up on that ridge.

625
00:53:42.162 --> 00:53:44.203
Then we'll get him my way.

626
00:53:45.141 --> 00:53:47.720
All right, look down. I want
you to stretch the skirmish line

627
00:53:47.722 --> 00:53:51.448
- right across this ridge.
- God damn it.

628
00:53:52.707 --> 00:53:54.408
God damn it.

629
00:53:58.646 --> 00:54:00.840
Come on. Let's go.
Over here.

630
00:54:03.952 --> 00:54:06.251
Come on! Move it!

631
00:54:07.889 --> 00:54:09.726
Let's go.

632
00:54:10.158 --> 00:54:12.048
Hey, this guy got a gun?

633
00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:14.064
Watch it. It's slippery.

634
00:54:16.131 --> 00:54:18.120
Watch your step.

635
00:54:18.335 --> 00:54:20.317
- What was that?
- What was that?

636
00:54:24.317 --> 00:54:27.146
- To the left or the right?
- Which way did he go?

637
00:54:27.170 --> 00:54:28.753
Toss it across. Toss it.

638
00:54:28.777 --> 00:54:31.111
Which way?

639
00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:23.030
Pa! Pa! Pa!

640
00:55:23.035 --> 00:55:25.752
- There's a guy above us, over there!
- What happened, son?

641
00:55:25.776 --> 00:55:26.877
I see him! Over there!

642
00:55:26.901 --> 00:55:28.000
I'll get him! I'll get him!

643
00:55:28.024 --> 00:55:30.000
Don't shoot! Cool down!

644
00:55:30.397 --> 00:55:32.558
This way! Let's go!

645
00:55:38.113 --> 00:55:40.695
There he is! Come on!

646
00:55:57.264 --> 00:55:59.060
Now we got him!

647
00:56:01.970 --> 00:56:05.633
Yes. Yes, I know exactly where it is.
Now, listen to me very carefully.

648
00:56:05.657 --> 00:56:08.467
Surround the area with every man
you've got, but don't move in.

649
00:56:08.469 --> 00:56:09.576
I repeat, don't move in.

650
00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:11.803
In fact, don't do anything
'til I get there.

651
00:56:11.827 --> 00:56:15.563
And no shooting. I don't want
him dead. I want him alive.

652
00:56:20.822 --> 00:56:21.994
Get down!

653
00:56:22.018 --> 00:56:24.348
God damn, get down!

654
00:56:32.768 --> 00:56:34.769
Keep firing!

655
00:56:36.736 --> 00:56:38.840
Come on, guys. Shoot!

656
00:56:39.656 --> 00:56:41.420
Come on!

657
00:56:42.993 --> 00:56:45.038
Oh, you guys are great.

658
00:56:45.062 --> 00:56:46.987
- All right, Steve?
- You?

659
00:56:46.989 --> 00:56:48.634
I want you and Bruce,
head around these trees,

660
00:56:48.637 --> 00:56:50.257
go to the front of that mine.

661
00:56:50.281 --> 00:56:52.073
Screw that, Clinton.
I ain't going up there.

662
00:56:52.097 --> 00:56:53.597
No way.

663
00:56:57.742 --> 00:56:59.586
Raymond? What?

664
00:56:59.610 --> 00:57:02.656
I want you to go into
that mine. Oh, not me.

665
00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:05.225
- What do you mean, "not me"?
- Look, I do this part-time.

666
00:57:05.249 --> 00:57:06.718
I didn't come here
to get killed.

667
00:57:06.742 --> 00:57:09.072
Now, he's probably in there
just waiting for us.

668
00:57:09.096 --> 00:57:11.120
What's wrong with you, Clinton?

669
00:57:14.768 --> 00:57:19.640
All right, Rambo,
this is Lieutenant Clinton Morgan,

670
00:57:19.664 --> 00:57:22.086
National Guard Leader.

671
00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:28.342
Now, I'm giving you just
three-zero seconds to come on out!

672
00:57:29.238 --> 00:57:31.209
Who's got the rocket launcher?

673
00:57:31.233 --> 00:57:33.721
- I do.
- Come here, Earl.

674
00:57:33.745 --> 00:57:35.242
Great.

675
00:57:35.266 --> 00:57:39.482
Rambo, is your last chance
to come out.

676
00:57:40.084 --> 00:57:41.979
Maybe we should wait.

677
00:57:42.853 --> 00:57:45.015
Earl, this creep is a killer!

678
00:57:45.039 --> 00:57:48.088
Besides, I'm in charge,
and I say we blow it up.

679
00:57:48.292 --> 00:57:49.986
Now fire that thing!

680
00:57:50.010 --> 00:57:52.296
Just let me
get out of the way first.

681
00:58:14.419 --> 00:58:16.267
Yeah!

682
00:58:16.990 --> 00:58:19.146
Give that man a cigar!

683
00:58:19.170 --> 00:58:20.895
Bull's-eye!

684
00:59:00.465 --> 00:59:03.779
- Where the hell are they?
- Up the hill about 500 yards.

685
00:59:06.737 --> 00:59:09.992
Move in a little closer,
just like Iwo Jima.

686
00:59:11.289 --> 00:59:12.853
I don't believe it.

687
00:59:12.877 --> 00:59:14.922
- Idiots!
- Steady. Got it.

688
00:59:14.946 --> 00:59:17.284
All right, Nick.
One more for Soldier of Fortune.

689
00:59:17.308 --> 00:59:18.785
Soldier of Fortune?

690
00:59:18.809 --> 00:59:20.823
Damn it! What the hell
do you think this is?

691
00:59:20.847 --> 00:59:22.251
Some kind of a circus?

692
00:59:22.275 --> 00:59:24.295
Get the hell out of here!

693
00:59:25.156 --> 00:59:27.255
Clinton, Jesus...

694
00:59:27.425 --> 00:59:28.884
Didn't you get the word, Clinton?

695
00:59:28.887 --> 00:59:30.962
I told you people to wait
until I got up here!

696
00:59:30.986 --> 00:59:35.069
Well, he was shooting at us, Will.
Come on, I wasn't taking any chances.

697
00:59:36.644 --> 00:59:38.470
Christ, what a mess.

698
00:59:40.054 --> 00:59:42.852
We're gonna have to dig his body
out of there right away.

699
00:59:43.550 --> 00:59:45.909
Oh, man. I mean you can't
get a dozer up here.

700
00:59:45.912 --> 00:59:47.875
You're gonna have
to find somebody to dig him out.

701
00:59:47.878 --> 00:59:49.766
Well, it's your mess, Clinton.
You clean it up.

702
00:59:49.790 --> 00:59:51.024
Will, come on!

703
00:59:51.048 --> 00:59:52.713
I gotta be back
at the drug store tomorrow.

704
00:59:52.716 --> 00:59:55.702
Then you better get started
right away, Clinton!

705
00:59:58.322 --> 01:00:00.198
Shit!

706
01:00:44.001 --> 01:00:47.546
Buried in a hole by a bunch
of god damn weekend warriors.

707
01:00:48.038 --> 01:00:50.217
I thought you said
he was the best you ever trained.

708
01:00:50.241 --> 01:00:54.221
However he may have ended up,
there was a time when he was very special.

709
01:00:54.245 --> 01:00:57.803
Special, my ass. He's just another
drifter that broke the law.

710
01:00:57.827 --> 01:01:00.760
Vagrancy, wasn't it?
That's gonna look real good

711
01:01:00.784 --> 01:01:02.730
on his gravestone at Arlington.

712
01:01:02.754 --> 01:01:06.707
"Here lies John Rambo,
winner of the Congressional Medal of Honour,

713
01:01:06.723 --> 01:01:10.320
"survivor of countless
incursions behind enemy lines,

714
01:01:11.094 --> 01:01:14.129
killed for vagrancy
in Jerkwater, U.S.A."

715
01:01:14.153 --> 01:01:17.026
Now don't give me
any of that crap, Trautman.

716
01:01:17.367 --> 01:01:20.984
You think Rambo was the only guy
who had a tough time in Vietnam?

717
01:01:21.008 --> 01:01:23.351
He killed a police officer,
for Christ sake!

718
01:01:23.354 --> 01:01:25.626
You're god damn lucky
he didn't kill all of ya.

719
01:01:42.643 --> 01:01:46.961
This character! He comes waltzing in here,
full of all kinds of good advice,

720
01:01:46.981 --> 01:01:51.253
and wished we'd let the god damn maniac
go loose so we can save our own asses!

721
01:01:51.269 --> 01:01:54.813
Well, we saved our asses, Colonel,
and we didn't let him go loose!

722
01:01:54.837 --> 01:01:57.047
The best man lost!

723
01:01:57.191 --> 01:01:59.360
And he doesn't like it!

724
01:02:20.949 --> 01:02:25.255
- That Rambo...
- Digging trenches in hell.

725
01:02:25.279 --> 01:02:27.665
Why did we follow him up here?
This is so damn stupid.

726
01:02:27.689 --> 01:02:30.223
I wanna get outta here.

727
01:03:32.403 --> 01:03:35.421
- How ya doing, Will?
- Hold my calls.

728
01:05:55.395 --> 01:05:56.986
Colonel?

729
01:06:01.418 --> 01:06:03.350
Have a seat.

730
01:06:08.425 --> 01:06:11.605
Oh, miss, would you do
this again, please?

731
01:06:11.629 --> 01:06:13.841
- Hi, Sheriff.
- And for my friend.

732
01:06:13.865 --> 01:06:16.458
- Give me a shooter.
- Wild Turkey.

733
01:06:18.168 --> 01:06:20.578
Look, if I was
out of line before, I...

734
01:06:21.022 --> 01:06:23.796
I just want to apologize.

735
01:06:25.159 --> 01:06:28.379
None of that makes
much difference now, does it?

736
01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:31.636
Nah, I guess not.

737
01:06:32.849 --> 01:06:34.803
I suppose...

738
01:06:35.886 --> 01:06:38.564
I don't know. I just feel...

739
01:06:40.123 --> 01:06:41.817
Like you were

740
01:06:41.999 --> 01:06:44.070
cheated out of your chance.

741
01:06:44.161 --> 01:06:46.753
I wanted to kill that kid.

742
01:06:47.464 --> 01:06:50.245
I wanted to kill him
so bad I could taste it.

743
01:06:51.634 --> 01:06:54.487
Doesn't sit well
with that badge?

744
01:06:55.164 --> 01:06:57.834
It can get confusing sometimes.

745
01:06:59.653 --> 01:07:03.362
In Vietnam, you can bet that
Rambo and I got pretty confused.

746
01:07:03.386 --> 01:07:05.843
But we had orders.

747
01:07:06.415 --> 01:07:09.870
When in doubt, kill.

748
01:07:13.357 --> 01:07:14.835
What the hell,
you're a civilian.

749
01:07:14.859 --> 01:07:16.860
You can go home to your

750
01:07:17.199 --> 01:07:19.555
wife and your house and
your little flower garden.

751
01:07:19.579 --> 01:07:21.892
You're under no pressure
to figure all this out.

752
01:07:21.916 --> 01:07:22.952
And what about you, Colonel?

753
01:07:22.976 --> 01:07:24.978
What did you figure out
from all of this, huh?

754
01:07:25.002 --> 01:07:27.265
I mean, what would you have
done with him if he came in?

755
01:07:27.289 --> 01:07:30.493
Would you wrap your arms around
him, give him a big, sloppy kiss?

756
01:07:30.507 --> 01:07:32.742
Or would you have
blown his brains out?

757
01:07:41.217 --> 01:07:44.745
I couldn't answer that
until I met him face-to-face.

758
01:07:45.722 --> 01:07:49.460
Yeah. Well, there it is.

759
01:07:50.927 --> 01:07:54.183
It's just as well we never got
a chance to find out.

760
01:09:45.609 --> 01:09:47.176
Drive.

761
01:09:49.613 --> 01:09:51.491
Don't look at me,
look at the road.

762
01:09:51.515 --> 01:09:53.617
That's how accidents happen.

763
01:09:54.484 --> 01:09:58.093
- What's your name?
- Ca... Cathcart, Robert A.

764
01:09:58.188 --> 01:10:00.385
All right, what do ya got
in the back, Robert A.?

765
01:10:00.409 --> 01:10:01.965
M60.

766
01:10:05.129 --> 01:10:06.907
- Okay, Robert A...
- Oh, please

767
01:10:06.909 --> 01:10:09.084
- get outta the truck.
- I got no beef with you.

768
01:10:09.087 --> 01:10:11.345
No! Go on! Move!
Go on!

769
01:10:32.722 --> 01:10:35.205
S.P. Car 1,
Charlie 5 to Central.

770
01:10:35.229 --> 01:10:36.442
Want to turn that up?

771
01:10:36.445 --> 01:10:38.446
Are we still
on that three-way hookup?

772
01:10:38.449 --> 01:10:40.115
Sheriff Teasle's office.

773
01:10:40.117 --> 01:10:43.939
Roger. Still working.
What's your story, Steamboat?

774
01:10:44.501 --> 01:10:46.844
Looks like somebody
pulled the plug too soon.

775
01:10:46.868 --> 01:10:50.084
That Rambo guy...
is on the loose again.

776
01:10:50.087 --> 01:10:52.477
Shit! Roger, Steamboat.
This is Trapper.

777
01:10:52.501 --> 01:10:54.586
We're setting up
roadblocks on Highway 26.

778
01:10:54.589 --> 01:10:57.908
Hey, Will, it's Rambo.
He's still around.

779
01:13:13.917 --> 01:13:17.221
- Heads up!
- Get out of the way!

780
01:14:38.402 --> 01:14:40.061
Holy fuck!

781
01:14:40.062 --> 01:14:42.869
All right, get out there
right away. Move!

782
01:15:08.006 --> 01:15:10.204
What the hell is going on?

783
01:15:13.136 --> 01:15:15.705
- Watch yourself!
- They're all gonna blow!

784
01:15:25.832 --> 01:15:28.002
Attention all civilians.

785
01:15:28.651 --> 01:15:30.196
For your own safety,

786
01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:33.724
please evacuate
the streets immediately.

787
01:15:34.123 --> 01:15:37.269
Remain indoors until you receive
further instructions.

788
01:15:37.293 --> 01:15:40.142
I repeat, this is
a police emergency.

789
01:15:40.166 --> 01:15:43.668
Please evacuate
the streets immediately.

790
01:16:01.651 --> 01:16:03.429
We found Rambo's body.

791
01:16:03.453 --> 01:16:06.976
As a matter of fact,
it stole an army truck,

792
01:16:06.979 --> 01:16:09.631
blew up a gas station
the other side of town.

793
01:16:10.461 --> 01:16:12.672
The kid is resilient.

794
01:16:12.896 --> 01:16:15.760
Why don't forget what you're thinking
and clear out while you can?

795
01:16:15.784 --> 01:16:19.224
Get the fuck outta here, Trautman
and you take your advice with you!

796
01:16:19.603 --> 01:16:21.426
When I talked to you
earlier this afternoon,

797
01:16:21.450 --> 01:16:23.733
you knew he was
still alive, didn't you?

798
01:16:25.275 --> 01:16:28.387
- I suspected.
- Yeah, sure.

799
01:16:28.411 --> 01:16:31.758
Sure. That's why you stuck around.
You trained him.

800
01:16:31.782 --> 01:16:35.038
You taught him how to get
out of places like that cave.

801
01:16:35.552 --> 01:16:37.871
But he's not gonna
get out of this place.

802
01:16:38.021 --> 01:16:40.823
Teasle, you and all your men
couldn't handle him before.

803
01:16:40.847 --> 01:16:43.250
Now what makes you think
you can handle him now?

804
01:16:43.576 --> 01:16:46.406
Because God knows what
damage he's prepared to do.

805
01:16:57.774 --> 01:17:01.690
- You're gonna die, Teasle.
- Everybody dies.

806
01:17:02.245 --> 01:17:05.157
There's only one man in this room
that's got half a chance.

807
01:17:05.181 --> 01:17:07.146
That's not because
I'm better than he is.

808
01:17:07.170 --> 01:17:09.341
It's because he trusts me.

809
01:17:09.365 --> 01:17:11.698
See, I'm the closest thing
to family that he has left,

810
01:17:11.722 --> 01:17:14.133
and that may be
all the edge I need.

811
01:17:14.157 --> 01:17:17.326
Jesus Christ,
where do you people come from?

812
01:17:21.363 --> 01:17:24.882
Now this is my job, Trautman.
This is my town.

813
01:17:24.906 --> 01:17:28.728
And I'm not giving it up to you
or to Rambo or to anybody else.

814
01:17:28.739 --> 01:17:31.705
Now, you just stay
the hell out of my way.

815
01:17:41.551 --> 01:17:45.480
- Get a little closer!
- I can't! It's too god damn hot!

816
01:17:46.877 --> 01:17:49.356
Will, this is Lester.
Do you copy? Over.

817
01:17:50.847 --> 01:17:52.538
Come on, let's go!

818
01:17:52.562 --> 01:17:55.070
Will, this is Lester.
Do you copy? Over.

819
01:17:55.297 --> 01:17:58.044
Listen, Will, we got
some serious problems.

820
01:17:58.068 --> 01:17:59.825
The highway's been cut off.

821
01:17:59.849 --> 01:18:02.822
The truck's out here,
but we couldn't find the body.

822
01:18:02.846 --> 01:18:06.232
I repeat, no body.
It's totally burned out.

823
01:18:06.256 --> 01:18:08.102
Preston, get those
people outta here!

824
01:18:08.984 --> 01:18:10.461
Move 'em back to the south side.

825
01:18:10.485 --> 01:18:13.049
- Move back! Move back!
- Listen, Will, we don't know how many

826
01:18:13.052 --> 01:18:16.427
gasoline reservoirs there are
under those gas pumps.

827
01:18:20.691 --> 01:18:23.469
- Do you copy? Over.
- We got a reporter here.

828
01:18:23.493 --> 01:18:26.279
Preston, push them back!
I don't care who he is!

829
01:18:30.417 --> 01:18:33.232
Listen, move them around!
Get the trucks to the other side!

830
01:18:33.256 --> 01:18:34.826
Come on! Let's go!

831
01:18:34.838 --> 01:18:37.573
Will, do you copy? Over.

832
01:21:28.478 --> 01:21:30.424
Come on, damn it.

833
01:21:30.513 --> 01:21:33.039
God damn it! God damn it!

834
01:24:09.071 --> 01:24:12.551
Go ahead. Go ahead!

835
01:24:12.575 --> 01:24:14.552
Go ahead,
you crazy son of a bitch...

836
01:24:14.555 --> 01:24:16.407
- ...finish me!
- Rambo!

837
01:24:16.578 --> 01:24:18.869
Rambo, don't do it!

838
01:24:19.349 --> 01:24:22.952
Listen to me, Rambo.
You have no chance.

839
01:24:23.319 --> 01:24:25.507
So drop your weapon.

840
01:24:26.155 --> 01:24:29.376
I'm gonna order the chopper in
to fly you back to Bragg.

841
01:24:31.742 --> 01:24:33.717
Hold your fire!

842
01:24:34.630 --> 01:24:37.284
Kern! Yes?

843
01:24:37.453 --> 01:24:38.743
Hold your fire!

844
01:24:38.767 --> 01:24:41.513
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

845
01:24:41.537 --> 01:24:43.767
Think about what you're doing.

846
01:24:45.241 --> 01:24:48.787
The building's perimeter
is covered. No exits.

847
01:24:48.811 --> 01:24:51.915
There are nearly 200 men
out there and a lot of M16s.

848
01:24:52.282 --> 01:24:55.539
You did everything
to make this private war happen.

849
01:24:55.684 --> 01:24:57.742
You've done enough damage!

850
01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:00.923
This mission is over, Rambo.
Do you understand me?

851
01:25:01.685 --> 01:25:03.795
This mission is over!

852
01:25:06.596 --> 01:25:08.427
Look at 'em out there.

853
01:25:11.233 --> 01:25:12.847
Look at 'em!

854
01:25:15.338 --> 01:25:17.882
If you don't end this now,
they're gonna kill you.

855
01:25:18.407 --> 01:25:19.706
Is that what you want?

856
01:25:19.730 --> 01:25:22.343
Back it up.
Watch yourselves.

857
01:25:23.345 --> 01:25:25.357
It's over, Johnny.

858
01:25:25.381 --> 01:25:28.400
- It's over!
- Nothing is over!

859
01:25:28.458 --> 01:25:29.695
Nothing!

860
01:25:29.719 --> 01:25:31.997
You just don't turn it off!

861
01:25:32.021 --> 01:25:33.866
It wasn't my war!

862
01:25:33.923 --> 01:25:36.071
You asked me, I didn't ask you!

863
01:25:36.095 --> 01:25:37.603
And I did what I had to do to win!

864
01:25:37.627 --> 01:25:39.699
But somebody wouldn't let us win!

865
01:25:39.829 --> 01:25:41.784
Then I come back to the world,

866
01:25:41.808 --> 01:25:44.142
and I see all those
maggots at the airport

867
01:25:44.166 --> 01:25:45.824
protesting me, spitting,

868
01:25:45.848 --> 01:25:48.901
calling me "Baby Killer"
and all kinds of vile crap!

869
01:25:49.205 --> 01:25:51.359
Who are they to protest me?

870
01:25:51.363 --> 01:25:53.638
Who are they, unless they've
been me and been there

871
01:25:53.641 --> 01:25:55.643
and know what the hell
they're yelling about!

872
01:25:55.667 --> 01:25:59.113
It was a bad time for everyone, Rambo.
It's all in the past now.

873
01:25:59.117 --> 01:26:00.178
For you!

874
01:26:00.202 --> 01:26:02.307
For me, civilian life is nothing!

875
01:26:02.331 --> 01:26:04.066
In the field,
we had a code of honour:

876
01:26:04.090 --> 01:26:06.204
You watch my back,
I watch yours.

877
01:26:06.206 --> 01:26:09.684
- Back here there's nothing!
- You're the last of an elite group.

878
01:26:09.959 --> 01:26:11.636
Don't end it like this.

879
01:26:11.660 --> 01:26:14.638
Back there I could fly a gunship,
I could drive a tank.

880
01:26:14.662 --> 01:26:16.522
I was in charge
of million-dollar equipment!

881
01:26:16.546 --> 01:26:19.869
Back here I can't even hold
a job parking cars!

882
01:26:23.054 --> 01:26:25.783
Fuck it. Fuck.

883
01:26:25.808 --> 01:26:28.698
Geez. Oh, God.

884
01:26:29.077 --> 01:26:31.457
Where is everybody?

885
01:26:31.481 --> 01:26:33.894
Oh, God.

886
01:26:36.810 --> 01:26:40.270
I had a friend, it was Danforth.

887
01:26:40.790 --> 01:26:43.230
I had all these guys, man.

888
01:26:43.526 --> 01:26:45.477
Back there I had
all these fucking guys...

889
01:26:45.501 --> 01:26:47.557
...who were my friends.

890
01:26:47.581 --> 01:26:49.841
'Cause back here there's nothing.

891
01:26:49.865 --> 01:26:51.734
Remember Danforth?

892
01:26:52.001 --> 01:26:53.384
He wore this black headband.

893
01:26:53.408 --> 01:26:55.763
I took one of his magic
markers and it said,

894
01:26:55.787 --> 01:27:00.052
"If found, mail us to Las Vegas"
'cause we were always talking about Vegas.

895
01:27:00.076 --> 01:27:03.789
And his fucking car,
this red '58 Chevy convertible.

896
01:27:03.813 --> 01:27:05.122
He was talking about this car.

897
01:27:05.146 --> 01:27:07.951
He said we were gonna cruise
'til the tires fall off.

898
01:27:15.657 --> 01:27:18.695
We go in this bar in Saigon,
and this kid comes up.

899
01:27:18.780 --> 01:27:21.039
This kid's carrying
a shoe shine box.

900
01:27:21.063 --> 01:27:24.360
And he says,
"Shine, please. Shine."

901
01:27:24.384 --> 01:27:27.465
I said no. He kept asking
yeah and Joey said yeah.

902
01:27:27.489 --> 01:27:30.353
And I went to get
a couple of beers.

903
01:27:30.377 --> 01:27:33.769
And the box is wired.
And he opened up the box.

904
01:27:33.793 --> 01:27:36.424
Fucking blew his body
all over the place.

905
01:27:36.448 --> 01:27:38.613
And he's laying there.
He's fucking screaming.

906
01:27:38.618 --> 01:27:41.927
There's pieces of him all over me.
Just... like this.

907
01:27:41.951 --> 01:27:45.956
And I'm trying to pull him off, you know?
And this is my friend that's all over me!

908
01:27:45.980 --> 01:27:49.075
I've got blood and everything!
I'm trying to hold him together!

909
01:27:49.099 --> 01:27:52.337
I'm putting him together!
His fucking insides keep coming out!

910
01:27:52.361 --> 01:27:55.374
And nobody would help!
Nobody would help!

911
01:27:55.398 --> 01:27:58.076
He's saying, "I wanna go home,
I wanna go home."

912
01:27:58.100 --> 01:27:59.271
He keeps calling my name.

913
01:27:59.295 --> 01:28:01.703
"I wanna go home, Johnny.
I wanna drive my Chevy."

914
01:28:01.709 --> 01:28:05.109
I said, "Why?
I can't find your fucking legs!

915
01:28:05.207 --> 01:28:07.810
I can't find your legs."

916
01:28:08.444 --> 01:28:10.856
I can't get it out of my head.

917
01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:13.292
I dream it seven years.

918
01:28:13.316 --> 01:28:15.294
Every day I have this.

919
01:28:15.318 --> 01:28:18.234
Sometimes I wake up,
I don't know where I am.

920
01:28:18.788 --> 01:28:21.229
I don't talk to anybody.

921
01:28:21.789 --> 01:28:24.075
Sometimes a day,

922
01:28:25.494 --> 01:28:27.742
sometimes a week.

923
01:28:28.797 --> 01:28:31.293
I can't put it out of my mind.

924
01:28:36.839 --> 01:28:38.802
Fuck it.

925
01:29:36.666 --> 01:29:39.167
Let's get him in.
