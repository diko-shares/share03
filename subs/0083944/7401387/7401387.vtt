<i><b>SUBTITLES BY LUIS-SUBS</b></i>

2
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.400
<i>Can you tell me if
Delmar Barry lives here?</i>

3
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.700
<i>Right up there.</i>

4
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.500
Excuse me. Can you tell me,
is this where Delmar Barry lives?

5
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.200
He ain't here.

6
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.400
Go on inside, baby.

7
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.800
He's a friend of mine.

8
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.800
As a matter of fact,
he wrote this address down.

9
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.400
Right here.

10
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.100
There. As you can see,
that's Delmar's writing.

11
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.000
I sure had a hard time
finding this place.

12
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.600
That's his writing.
Like I said, he's a friend.

13
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.100
My name is John Rambo. We served
on the same team together in 'Nam.

14
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.200
I don't know if he ever
talked about me.

15
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.300
I've got a picture of
us together,

16
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.200
somewhere.

17
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.400
This junk in my pocket.

18
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.500
Here it is.
Here it is.

19
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.200
That's me.
That's Danforth and Westmore,

20
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.200
Bronson, Ortega, and there's
Delmar right in the back.

21
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.200
We had to put him in the back
'cause he's so big.

22
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.200
If we didn't,
he'd take up the whole picture.

23
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.900
Look how big he is.
Delmar's gone.

24
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.500
What time will he be back?
He died.

25
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.500
What?
He died last summer.

26
00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.600
Died. How?

27
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.800
Cancer.
Brought it back from 'Nam.

28
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.200
<i>All that orange stuff
they spreaded around.</i>

29
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.500
Cut him down to nothing.

30
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.200
I could lift him off the sheet.

31
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.900
I'm very sorry.

32
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.700
Morning, Annie.
How you doing, girls?

33
00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.200
<i>Great. Thanks.
You all right this morning?</i>

34
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.500
<i>Andy!
Howdy, Will.</i>

35
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.900
<i>Morning, Dave.
Hi, Sheriff.</i>

36
00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.500
Gonna take a bath this week?

37
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.800
Morning.

38
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.800
You, uh, you visiting
somebody around here?

39
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.100
No.

40
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.500
You know, wearing that flag
on that jacket,

41
00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.800
looking the way you do,

42
00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.700
<i>you're asking for trouble
around here, friend.</i>

43
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.100
Headed north or south?
North.

44
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.500
Ah, jump in.

45
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.700
I'll make sure you're heading
the right direction, hmm?

46
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.200
Where you headed?
Portland.

47
00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.200
Portland is south.
You said you were headed north.

48
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.800
You got someplace
I can eat around here?

49
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.300
There's a diner about 30
miles up the highway.

50
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.100
Is there any law against
me getting something here?

51
00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.500
Yeah. Me.

52
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:00.800
Why are you pushing me?

53
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:03.700
What did you say?

54
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.900
I said, why are you pushing me?
I haven't done anything to you.

55
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.200
First of all, you don't ask
the questions around here, I do.

56
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.400
<i>You understand?
Secondly,</i>

57
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.400
<i>we don't want guys
like you in this town.</i>

58
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.300
<i>Drifters.</i>

59
00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:20.800
First thing you know,

60
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.400
we got a whole bunch of guys like
you in this town. That's why.

61
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.600
Besides, you wouldn't like it here.

62
00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.200
This is, this is a quiet
little town.

63
00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.800
In fact,
you might say it's boring.

64
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.600
But that's the way we like it.

65
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.400
And I get paid
to keep it that way.

66
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.500
Boring.

67
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.100
Portland, straight ahead.

68
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.500
Now if you want
some friendly advice,

69
00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.200
get a haircut and take a bath.

70
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.300
You wouldn't get
hassled so much.

71
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.400
Hope this ride helped you out.

72
00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.400
You have a nice day, hmm?

73
00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.100
Where the hell do you
think you're going?

74
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Hey, I'm talking
to you, goddamn...

75
00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.300
Let me see some I.D.
Damn it!

76
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.600
All right. You're under arrest.
You hear me?

77
00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:16.700
<i>Put your hands on the car.</i>

78
00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:21.100
Now you put your hands
on the car and you spread 'em.

79
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.100
<i>Now you're gonna put your
hands on that car.</i>

80
00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.000
How you do it, you decide.
Right now!

81
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.000
Get your legs back.

82
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.600
Get 'em back!

83
00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:49.700
You know, you try to be nice
to some people.

84
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.200
Well, what do
we have here, huh?

85
00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.900
Why would you be carrying
a knife like this?

86
00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:06.200
Hunting.
Don't be a wise guy.

87
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.700
What do you hunt with a knife?

88
00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.700
Name it.

89
00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.200
Hi, Will.
Lester.

90
00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.200
Buzz us in, will ya?

91
00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:22.600
Talk about your
sorry-looking humanity.

92
00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.200
Just another
smart-ass drifter.

93
00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.200
Good morning, Arthur.

94
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:32.400
Morning, Will.
What do ya got?

95
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.500
I want you to book this
gentleman for vagrancy,

96
00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:38.200
resisting arrest,
carrying a concealed weapon.

97
00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:40.900
He says he uses it for hunting.

98
00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.900
Hunting? What do you hunt?
Elephants?

99
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.400
Why don't you see if you can
clean him up a little bit.

100
00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:47.700
He smells like an animal.

101
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.700
<i>Hey, Mitch? Mitch?
Yo.</i>

102
00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.600
Escort this young man
downstairs, would ya?

103
00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.100
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

104
00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.400
Right this way, partner.

105
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.200
Right here. That's it.

106
00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.200
Okay.
Here we go.

107
00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:18.800
<i>You know, it looks like
it's going to take ol' Leroy...</i>

108
00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.100
<i>about ten years
to paint this hall.</i>

109
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.800
<i>Why don't you paint it your damn self?
Leroy, sling that paint, boy</i>

110
00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.900
<i>Mr. Ward?
Hm-mm?</i>

111
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.200
Would you take this for me, please?
Thank you.

112
00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.600
Yeah.

113
00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:39.600
Name?

114
00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:45.900
Your name?

115
00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:51.900
<i>Your name?</i>

116
00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:55.900
<i>Name?</i>

117
00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.200
Hey, if you're looking
for trouble,

118
00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.400
you came to the right place,
buddy.

119
00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.400
Wait a second.

120
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.400
Hey, you got three seconds
before I break your face in.

121
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:11.500
He means it.

122
00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.800
Yeah. I do.

123
00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:36.300
What do you know about that?
Ol' Harry here's a soldier.

124
00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.900
"Rambo." John J.?

125
00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:46.500
<i>You gonna talk to me.</i>

126
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.500
<i>I promise you're gonna
talk to me, soldier.</i>

127
00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.800
I'm starting to dislike you...

128
00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.200
...a lot!

129
00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.300
I'm gonna run a make on him.

130
00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.400
Put his name in the teletype.

131
00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.500
Now just roll it across.

132
00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.400
Roll it.
Roll it across.

133
00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.700
Push it.
It won't work that way. It'll only smear.

134
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:17.700
Now roll it across!
Look, you son of a bitch,

135
00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.700
if you don't put your
goddamn hand down there,

136
00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.900
I'm going to break it off.
Now, put it down, goddamn it!

137
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.300
Art, what the hell
is going on down here?

138
00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.600
Oh, nothing I can't handle.

139
00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.000
He won't let us
print him, Will.

140
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.600
Leave the ink on the hand!

141
00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:37.600
Just what is your problem, huh?

142
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.500
Now, listen, hard ass,
as things stand right now,

143
00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:44.800
you're facing the ass end of a 90-day
incarceration, plus a $250 fine,

144
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.800
which you don't look to me
like you can pay.

145
00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.800
At 10:00 tomorrow morning, you're
going up in front of that judge.

146
00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:54.300
And you think we're tough.
Now we're going to make

147
00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.900
you a little bit more presentable
for your courtroom appearance.

148
00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.800
And between now and then, you can
just impress the hell out of me...

149
00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:03.300
by doing exactly
as you're told.

150
00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:09.800
Now clean him up.

151
00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:12.300
<i>All right, Preston,</i>

152
00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:15.300
I want you to go over there
and get that hose ready.

153
00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:16.600
All right?

154
00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.300
Holy shit!
Look at this.

155
00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:25.000
What the hell's he been into?
Who gives a shit?

156
00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:29.000
All right, put your hands on top
of your head and turn around.

157
00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.300
Oh, Christ!

158
00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:37.000
We should report this to Teasle, Galt.
Look at that.

159
00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:40.000
You just do what I tell ya.

160
00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:46.000
Galt, what the fuck was that?

161
00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:49.400
Well, the man said
clean 'em up.

162
00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.000
Clean him up.

163
00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:04.500
Hey, Preston,

164
00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:08.200
don't forget to get him
behind the ears!

165
00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:15.200
How do you like that, huh?

166
00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.200
What's the matter, Mitch?

167
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.500
Don't you like water sports?

168
00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:30.100
<i>Hurry it up.
It's time for my coffee break.</i>

169
00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.600
Sit down.
Easy. Sit down.

170
00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:35.700
Sit down.
All right. Sit on the stool.

171
00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:40.100
Come on.

172
00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.600
Damn! Damn, this boy's
hard to get ahold of.

173
00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:49.100
Ward, don't worry about
the soap. He's tough.

174
00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.300
Just shave him, dry.
All right.

175
00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:56.800
How blind are you?
Can't you see this guy's crazy?

176
00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:00.300
Can't you see I don't give a shit?
Yeah, I can see that.

177
00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:01.600
Good, that's better.

178
00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:05.700
See there, I knew he knew
what was good for him.

179
00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:07.700
Just gonna shave you, partner.

180
00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:11.300
Take it easy.
Take this, Mitch.

181
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.300
Don't move.

182
00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:20.000
I don't want you
to cut your own throat.

183
00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.400
Hey! Hey!

184
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.200
You son of a bitch!

185
00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:36.900
Come on!

186
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.900
Get him off of me!

187
00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.100
What the hell is...

188
00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:02.300
Art? Art?

189
00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.600
What was that?

190
00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:19.000
Hey, you can't...

191
00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:25.100
Hey, hey,
wait a minute...

192
00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.500
Hey!

193
00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.600
I'm gonna get that son of a bitch!
Art, don't shoot!

194
00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:52.800
Goddamn it! Don't shoot.
There's people down there.

195
00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.900
Get help.
I'll go after him.

196
00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.200
Move! Look out!

197
00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:00.400
Get out of the way!

198
00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:20.700
Aaah!

199
00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:42.200
Son of a bitch!

200
00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.500
Lester, this is Will.
I'm right on his tail.

201
00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.200
He's just east of Smith's farm,
headed towards Chapman Creek.

202
00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:18.000
<i>I know you can hear me!</i>

203
00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.300
You're finished!

204
00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.900
You've gone as far
as you're gonna go!

205
00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:28.300
<i>You hear me?</i>

206
00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:37.400
Mitch! Lester!

207
00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:40.700
He's up there, beyond the draw.

208
00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.000
Mitch, get Orval on the radio.

209
00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:46.000
Tell him to get out here
with his damn dogs right away.

210
00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.000
And tell him to bring
the Dobermans.

211
00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.400
It's gonna rain. We'll need
dogs that can hunt on sight.

212
00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.100
<i>Right!</i>

213
00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:53.200
Lester, tell Galt to get
out to the lumber camp.

214
00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:55.400
Tell him to get the helicopter up here.
Right.

215
00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:56.900
If they give him any shit,

216
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.900
tell him to cite them for
obstruction right on the spot!

217
00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:05.900
We'll get him.
No problem.

218
00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:41.400
Come on, Duke, Thunder.
Let's get him.

219
00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:44.300
Come on, sweethearts.
That's it, babies.

220
00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.300
Let's go get him!

221
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.300
We'll be done
in a couple of hours.

222
00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:51.300
It won't be long before you have this
one stuffed and mounted, huh, Will?

223
00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:56.300
Didn't we go deer hunting here last year?
Yeah. I got a couple bucks.

224
00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:59.200
I'll shoot anything.
Hey, Mitch, up the hill.

225
00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.400
Keep those dogs
away from me, Orval.

226
00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:23.400
I don't trust those bastards.

227
00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:24.800
Keep moving, 'cause my dogs...

228
00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:27.400
can eat and run
at the same time.

229
00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:29.900
He's heading straight
for the top.

230
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000
Is this guy supposed to be dangerous?
He's just dumb.

231
00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.400
Hey, Walt, you're spoiling
the scent.

232
00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:54.100
Let my babies do the job.
Go ahead.

233
00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:56.600
I'm trailing you here.

234
00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.400
This is no good.
Why?

235
00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:01.800
There were three of us
on him in the cell block.

236
00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:04.700
He went through us
like we weren't even there.

237
00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:07.000
Aw, come on.

238
00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:40.800
Let's go, babies.
Come on, Duke.

239
00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:44.500
<i>Hey, hey.
Okay, Thunder.</i>

240
00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.200
Come on, Duke.
We got him cornered.

241
00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:24.100
Art, this is Teasle.
He's headed for Chapman Gorge.

242
00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:27.100
<i>Chapman Gorge. Head him off.</i>

243
00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.100
Oh!

244
00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:43.600
God! No!

245
00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:03.100
There he is!
On the cliff!

246
00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:22.500
Son of a bitch!

247
00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:31.800
What the hell's going on?

248
00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:34.500
What are you doing?
We're just supposed to spot him.

249
00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.000
Hold it steady.

250
00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:38.700
I can't!
We're in a thermal draft.

251
00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:42.000
Galt, he's stuck there.
He can't go anyplace.

252
00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:45.500
If you don't fly
this thing right,

253
00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:48.600
I swear to God,
I'm gonna kill you.

254
00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:52.300
<i>Sheriff to Galt. Come in Galt.</i>

255
00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:59.300
Hold it steady,
you son of a bitch!

256
00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:01.400
Galt, come in, goddamn it!

257
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.600
Get in closer,
and hold it steady.

258
00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:07.000
<i>Galt, talk to me. I want
to know what's going on!</i>

259
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000
I got him.
Easy. Easy.

260
00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:43.000
Ow! Jesus!

261
00:28:58.700 --> 00:28:59.600
There he is!

262
00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:03.200
<i>He's over there, dummy.
Come on!</i>

263
00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:05.300
Go on!

264
00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:09.800
Hey, soldier boy!

265
00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:16.700
Move it, move it down the side.

266
00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:24.300
Hold it steady!

267
00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.200
Come on!

268
00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:33.400
<i>Galt, get on this radio!
What's going on up there?</i>

269
00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:38.500
<i>I don't want him dead, Galt!
I want him alive. You hear me?</i>

270
00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.600
<i>Art, come in!</i>

271
00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:42.600
Watch out!

272
00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:41.800
<i>Art Galt, come in.
Helicopter, come in, goddamn it!</i>

273
00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:44.000
<i>Jesus Christ!
Look!</i>

274
00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:51.000
Jesus Christ.
Give me the binoculars, hurry.

275
00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:54.600
Oh, no, no, no.
Shit!

276
00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:02.400
Jesus Christ.

277
00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.100
I can't figure it.

278
00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:45.700
How'd he fall out?
Does it matter?

279
00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:49.000
Let's nail this sucker's ass.
He can't be far.

280
00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:50.400
Will!

281
00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.800
Looks like he wants
to turn himself in.

282
00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:58.900
There's one man dead!

283
00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:03.300
It's not my fault!
I don't want any more hurt!

284
00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:05.000
Freeze!

285
00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:07.600
Stand right where you are!
Give yourself up!

286
00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:09.800
But I didn't do anything!

287
00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:12.900
I'm warning you boy, don't make
a move! I'll blow your head off!

288
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.400
I didn't do anything!

289
00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.800
Ow!

290
00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.600
Cease fire!
Cease fire!

291
00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.800
Ward, goddamn it, cease fire!

292
00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:28.300
I think we hit him.

293
00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:30.600
Let's get down there.
Move!

294
00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:35.000
<i>Sheriff to base. Come in.</i>

295
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.900
Go ahead, Will.

296
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.900
Lester, we're down
in the gorge.

297
00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:45.700
Galt's dead all right. Where the
hell is that goddamn chopper?

298
00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:49.000
He won't come, Will. Says there's
a storm headed your way.

299
00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:53.500
I don't give a goddamn what's on its way!
I want that chopper back here right now!

300
00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:55.700
<i>I don't want Galt's body
out here all night.</i>

301
00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:56.600
<i>I'll do what I can.</i>

302
00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:59.500
<i>Listen Will, you sure picked one hell
of a guy to mess around with.</i>

303
00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:03.700
<i>This came over the teletype a few minutes
ago, John Rambo is a Vietnam vet.</i>

304
00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:08.500
<i>He's a Green Beret. Congressional
Medal of Honor. Guy's a war hero.</i>

305
00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:09.700
Jesus, that freak?

306
00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:11.600
I knew there was something
about that guy.

307
00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:14.200
<i>I double-checked it, Will.</i>

308
00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:16.000
<i>What do you want me to do?</i>

309
00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:23.200
I want you to do what I told you
to do, goddamn it!

310
00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:27.300
Get that chopper back
here now! Out!

311
00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:33.000
Green Beret.
War hero.

312
00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:36.200
That's great. That's just great.
Why don't you shut your mouth?

313
00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:38.700
Now what the hell's
the matter with you guys?

314
00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.500
He's one man.
He's wounded.

315
00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:45.500
Those Green Berets,
they're real bad asses.

316
00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:47.900
Why don't you let
the state police handle this?

317
00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:55.100
Come here, boy.
Come here, goddamn it!

318
00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:59.600
Look, look at him, look at him!
It's Art Galt, boy.

319
00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:03.800
He and I were friends when your
mama was still wiping your nose!

320
00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:08.400
Now he's dead. He's dead because
of that psycho out there!

321
00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:11.300
Now you listen to me good, boy.
I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.

322
00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:15.300
And I'm gonna pin that Congressional
Medal of Honor to his liver.

323
00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:20.000
And I'm gonna do it with you
or without you.

324
00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:35.300
Dang! Twisted my ankle!

325
00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:41.000
We're closing in.
The scent's getting stronger.

326
00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:43.500
All right, keep your eyes open.

327
00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:46.000
Come on, baby.

328
00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:49.700
It's gonna storm.
That's all we need now.

329
00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:52.800
Will, let's get out of here
before it gets too dark.

330
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000
What's the matter?
Are you afraid of the bogeyman?

331
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000
You goddamn pansy.

332
00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.600
Ward, put your gun down.
I'll show you who the pansy is.

333
00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:01.000
Okay, come on down!

334
00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.300
<i>Hey, guys, knock it off!</i>

335
00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:06.200
Ward, move on!
The fight is out there!

336
00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:07.500
He's out there waiting for you!

337
00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:11.000
Mitch, get on your feet
and move!

338
00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:12.800
<i>Let's go find this guy,
for Christ's sake!</i>

339
00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:13.200
<i>Come on!</i>

340
00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.300
<i>Keep your eyes open!
Come on there, Duke!</i>

341
00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.800
I'll see you later, Ward!

342
00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:19.700
Shut up, Mitch!

343
00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:27.800
Let's go, girl. Come on.
There he is!

344
00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:31.200
Turn them loose!
Turn those dogs loose, Orval!

345
00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:33.700
Go get 'em, sweethearts!
There's your dinner!

346
00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:49.600
<i>Cease fire! Cease fire!</i>

347
00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:52.500
I'm hit!
Goddamn it, I'm hit!

348
00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:58.200
Jesus.
He's got a gun.

349
00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:09.300
It's not him!
It's a goddamn scarecrow!

350
00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:13.500
It was no scarecrow that shot Orval!
He's close, he's real close!

351
00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:17.600
Kill 'im! Kill 'im!
Go get 'im!

352
00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:20.200
Go get 'im, Maggie!

353
00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:30.700
Mitch!

354
00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:33.500
Mitch, Ward, come here.

355
00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:37.500
Shingleton, you cover us.
Look at his leg.

356
00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:40.000
Mitch, get your belt.
Get a tourniquet around that.

357
00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:43.800
We gotta get this guy to a doctor!
Goddamn it! Get your belt on there fast!

358
00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:46.100
Where's the first aid kit?
I left it in the car.

359
00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:48.100
Shit!
Where'd he get the gun?

360
00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:50.100
It's got to be Art Galt's gun.

361
00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:52.000
He's out of ammo.
How do you know that?

362
00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:54.000
Because whatever killed
that last dog was no bullet!

363
00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:56.000
That's how.
Hurry up!

364
00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:59.500
Orval, listen to me. Now listen,
You got to stay awake, all right?

365
00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:01.500
You got to release that
tourniquet every 15 minutes.

366
00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:03.500
We'll be right back!
Shh.

367
00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:05.200
We got to get him now.
He's out of ammo.

368
00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:07.500
Hurry up! Move!
He had no right to shoot my babies.

369
00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:11.100
Get the son of a bitch! Go get him!
Come on! Let's go!

370
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.700
All right. All right.
Now, listen up.

371
00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:18.700
We're right on top of him. We're gonna
form a skirmish line 50 feet apart.

372
00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:21.900
And keep moving. There's no way
out of here except through us.

373
00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:27.700
Okay.
Let's do some hunting.

374
00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:28.800
Hunting?

375
00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:31.400
We ain't hunting him.
He's hunting us.

376
00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:47.800
Spread out!
Spread out, damn it!

377
00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.300
I said 50 feet!

378
00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:12.100
Ow! Damn! Ow!

379
00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:15.300
God, I hate this!

380
00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:27.400
Huh?
Ow! God!

381
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000
<i>- Will, it's Mitch!
- Oh, shit, Will!</i>

382
00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:34.600
Oh, God!

383
00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:37.200
Will!

384
00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:40.900
Who is it?
Will!

385
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.100
Will!

386
00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:53.900
Mitch?

387
00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:09.300
What the hell's going on?
Shut up!

388
00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:12.600
Oh! Will!

389
00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:14.500
He's got Ward.

390
00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:17.700
All right, spread out.
I'll go this way.

391
00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:18.500
Will!

392
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:23.500
Will! Oh! Oh! Will!

393
00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:27.100
Over here!

394
00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:29.500
Will!
He's over here!

395
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.600
Who fired?

396
00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:37.400
Who the hell is firing?
I got him! I got him!

397
00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:39.800
Shingleton, follow me!

398
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.300
I got him!

399
00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:48.300
Somebody help me!
Help me, Will!

400
00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:52.200
Will!
Balford?

401
00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:55.800
Balford, where the hell are ya?
Will!

402
00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:02.100
Help!
Help me!

403
00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:03.700
Balford?

404
00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:10.100
Shingleton, over here!

405
00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:14.000
God.
Jesus.

406
00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:17.500
Easy. Easy. All right. Hold it.
Get me out of here.

407
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.200
Jesus Christ!

408
00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:28.600
Shingleton,
where the hell are ya?

409
00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:33.600
Shingleton?

410
00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:37.700
Shingleton?

411
00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:39.700
Will!

412
00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:44.100
Will!

413
00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:46.700
Jesus Christ!

414
00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:49.300
Jesus...

415
00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:53.700
I could've killed them all.

416
00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:56.100
I could have killed you.

417
00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:59.400
In town, you're the law.
Out here, it's me.

418
00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:01.400
Don't push it!

419
00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:04.900
Don't push it, or I'll give
you a war you won't believe.

420
00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:09.600
Let it go!

421
00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:13.200
Let it go!

422
00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:55.300
All right. Coming in.

423
00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:03.800
Come on. Get back.
Move back, you guys. Move back.

424
00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:16.600
<i>Captain, can we have a
comment on what's happening?</i>

425
00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:19.600
How bad is the situation?
Captain, we need some...

426
00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:21.400
Only good thing to come
out of this mess...

427
00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:23.200
is the business
we're doing in town.

428
00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:26.200
Reporters are drinking
the place dry.

429
00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:31.200
You look like you're ready
to keel over, Will.

430
00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:33.900
Why don't you go home?
It's my problem now.

431
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.700
Your problem?
Listen, Dave,

432
00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:39.700
don't give me any of your horseshit about
jurisdiction on this one, you understand?

433
00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:42.900
Would you like me to step outside?
Just finish up what you're doing.

434
00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:45.800
<i>Somewhere in this
rugged mountain countryside,</i>

435
00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:49.100
<i>possibly above the snow line,
shrouded in mist,</i>

436
00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:51.800
the fugitive John Rambo
is hiding.

437
00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:55.100
Units of the state police, along with
local members of the National Guard...

438
00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:57.000
are now being mobilized.

439
00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:59.900
What still remains unexplained
by local authorities...

440
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.200
is just how and where
the former Green Beret...

441
00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:04.900
came into possession
of the weapons with which...

442
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.700
he allegedly killed
one deputy sheriff...

443
00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:08.700
and tried to kill six others.

444
00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:12.700
Only their skilled training in police
enforcement techniques saved their lives.

445
00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:16.900
And word now is that the fugitive will
be in custody in a matter of hours.

446
00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:19.600
Here's the maps, Will.

447
00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:23.500
Will, there's something
I think you ought to know.

448
00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:26.300
Talk to you later.
Okay?

449
00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:28.900
What is it, Lester? What is it?
For chrissake's! Spit it out!

450
00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:33.700
Well, I was,
I was just talking to Mitch,

451
00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:36.700
and he was saying that Galt
and a couple deputies...

452
00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:39.500
were, uh, a little hard
on the guy.

453
00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:41.400
Assholes!

454
00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:44.100
Doesn't make one goddamn
bit of difference, Dave,

455
00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:46.400
and you know it!

456
00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:48.500
Look, if one of my deputies...

457
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.200
gets out of line
with a prisoner,

458
00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:53.000
then the prisoner
comes to me with it!

459
00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:55.600
If I find out it's like he says,
I kick the deputy's ass!

460
00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:59.200
Me! The law! That's
the way it's got to be!

461
00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:01.700
People start fuckin' around
with the law...

462
00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:04.400
and all hell breaks loose!

463
00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:09.100
Whatever possessed God in heaven
to make a man like Rambo?

464
00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:11.500
<i>God didn't make Rambo.</i>

465
00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:14.900
I made him.
Who the hell are you?

466
00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:18.700
Sam Trautman.
Colonel Samuel Trautman.

467
00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:21.800
We're a little busy this morning,
Colonel. What can I do for you?

468
00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:24.000
I've come to get my boy.
Your boy?

469
00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:25.800
I recruited him.
I trained him.

470
00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:28.400
I commanded him in Vietnam
for three years.

471
00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:30.800
I'd say that makes him mine.

472
00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:36.200
I wonder why the Pentagon would send a
full-bird colonel down here to handle this.

473
00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:38.700
The Army thought
I might be able to help.

474
00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:42.700
I don't know in what way. Rambo's
a civilian now. He's my problem.

475
00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:45.300
I don't think you understand.

476
00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:48.500
I didn't come here
to rescue Rambo from you.

477
00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:51.400
I came here
to rescue you from him.

478
00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:55.300
Well, we all appreciate
your concern, Colonel.

479
00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:56.900
I will try to be extra careful.

480
00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:00.700
I'm just amazed that he allowed
any of your posse to live.

481
00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:02.100
Is that right?

482
00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:06.200
Strictly speaking, he slipped up.
You're lucky to be breathing.

483
00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:07.700
That's just great!

484
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.300
Colonel, you came out here
to find out...

485
00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:12.700
why one of your machines
blew a gasket.

486
00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:14.600
You don't seem to want
to accept the fact...

487
00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:17.600
that you're dealing with an
expert in guerrilla warfare.

488
00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:19.400
With a man who's the best...

489
00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:22.400
with guns, with knives,
with his bare hands.

490
00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:25.100
A man who's been trained
to ignore pain,

491
00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:28.900
ignore weather,
to live off the land,

492
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.800
to eat things that would
make a billy goat puke.

493
00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:35.600
In Vietnam, his job was
to dispose of enemy personnel.

494
00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:38.100
To kill. Period.

495
00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:40.100
Win by attrition.

496
00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:42.700
Well, Rambo was the best.

497
00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:40.900
Okay, Colonel, you got us all
scared to death.

498
00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:43.800
What do you and the Special
Forces think I ought to do...

499
00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:48.100
about your psycho out there?
Let him go.

500
00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:50.200
Do what?
For now.

501
00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:53.700
Diffuse the whole situation.
Diffuse him.

502
00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:56.500
Provide a little gap
and let him slip through it.

503
00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:58.500
Then put out
a nationwide A.P.B.

504
00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:00.500
In a couple of weeks,
you'll pick him up...

505
00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:02.200
in Seattle or someplace,
working in a car wash.

506
00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:04.100
There'll be no fight.
Nobody else will get hurt.

507
00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:05.600
I do my own work.

508
00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:07.600
I don't figure the best way
to do that is to close...

509
00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:09.900
my eyes and then hope he gets
picked up in Seattle.

510
00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:12.500
If you send your people in there
after him, they'll get killed.

511
00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:15.600
You know, we're just a small, hick town
sheriff's department, Colonel

512
00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:17.300
but we're expected
to do our duty...

513
00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:19.400
just like our heroes
in the Special Forces.

514
00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:23.300
In Special Forces, we teach our people
to stay alive in the line of duty.

515
00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:26.500
No shit! I never thought of that.
You want a war you can't win?

516
00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:30.700
Are you telling me that 200 men against
your boy is a no-win situation for us?

517
00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:32.700
You send that many,
don't forget one thing.

518
00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:35.700
What?
A good supply of body bags.

519
00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:39.800
Trautman!

520
00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:44.300
I don't know which side
you're on, Trautman.

521
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.600
I still think you came out
here just to cover your ass.

522
00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:51.800
But if you're serious about taking
Rambo out clean, follow me.

523
00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:16.700
State Police
calling John Rambo. Acknowledge.

524
00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:25.400
State Police calling
John Rambo.

525
00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:27.900
Come in, please.
Acknowledge.

526
00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:32.100
If you're listening, Rambo,
here is your situation.

527
00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:33.800
You are surrounded.

528
00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:36.300
Every possible exit
has been blocked.

529
00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:39.400
<i>Every highway, every road,
every firebreak.</i>

530
00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:41.100
<i>You have our word that your
services to your country...</i>

531
00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:43.100
<i>will be taken
into consideration,</i>

532
00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:45.100
and you will receive
fair treatment.

533
00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:47.700
Just respond. We can work
everything out. Over.

534
00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:49.200
Anything?

535
00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:52.300
He took a radio off
of one of my deputies.

536
00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:53.900
Then he has to be listening.

537
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.600
If I was in his position,
I'd try to pick up information.

538
00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:59.200
Maybe catch some cross talk.
Of course he's listening.

539
00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:02.200
But he's not gonna break radio silence.
No. Not for us.

540
00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:04.700
But he might do it
for you, Colonel.

541
00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:07.200
He's your boy, isn't he?

542
00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:10.200
Maybe you can talk him into...

543
00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:13.400
sparing all our lives
by giving himself up.

544
00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:15.700
I can try.

545
00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:18.000
At least, we'll get
a radio fix on his position,

546
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:19.800
if you don't mind
setting him up for us.

547
00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:23.800
Setting him up for you? That's like
bringing the pigeons to the cat.

548
00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:27.400
Son of a bitch.

549
00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:30.900
Hey, Don, thanks for
bringing your people out.

550
00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:31.800
Any time, Will.

551
00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:34.900
Come on, Bobby put the magazine away,
will ya? Pay attention.

552
00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:36.800
We may only get
one crack at this.

553
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:45.100
<i>Covey Leader
calling Raven. Come on, Raven.</i>

554
00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:49.600
<i>Covey Leader calling Raven.</i>

555
00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:56.900
<i>Covey Leader to Raven.
Talk to me, Johnny.</i>

556
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.300
Covey Leader
to identify Baker Team.

557
00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:04.200
Rambo, Messner,

558
00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:06.500
Ortega, Coletta,

559
00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:08.800
Jorgensen, Danforth,

560
00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:13.000
Barry, Krackauer.
Confirm.

561
00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:15.900
<i>This is Col. Trautman.</i>

562
00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:19.000
<i>Talk to me, Johnny.</i>

563
00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:34.800
<i>They're all gone, sir.</i>

564
00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:37.200
It's him. It's him.
Get on it.

565
00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:39.900
Rambo, are you
all right? Over.

566
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:41.400
Baker Team,
they're all dead, sir.

567
00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:45.300
<i>Not Delmar Barry.
He made it.</i>

568
00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:48.000
Barry's gone too, sir.

569
00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:50.400
<i>How?</i>

570
00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:54.200
Got himself killed in 'Nam.
Didn't even know it.

571
00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:55.800
Cancer ate him
down to the bone.

572
00:51:57.900 --> 00:51:58.800
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

573
00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:02.400
I'm the last one, sir.

574
00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:06.500
<i>It's good to hear your voice, Johnny.
It's been a long time.</i>

575
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.000
Look, John, you've
done some damage here,

576
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.400
<i>That's it. Northwest.
but they don't want any more trouble.</i>

577
00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:13.100
He's northwest.

578
00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:15.100
That's why I've come.

579
00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:17.900
I'm gonna come in there
and fly you the hell out.

580
00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:20.500
<i>Just you and me. We'll work
this thing out together.</i>

581
00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:22.200
<i>Is that fair enough?</i>

582
00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:25.100
Where'd you come from, sir?

583
00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:26.700
<i>Bragg.</i>

584
00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:28.800
I tried to get in touch
with you,

585
00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:31.200
but the guys at Bragg never
knew where to find you.

586
00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:32.900
I haven't been spending
much time there lately.

587
00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:36.600
They've got me down in D.C.
I'm shining a seat with my ass.

588
00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:39.000
I wish I was back at Bragg now.

589
00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:43.600
We'll talk about that
when you come in.

590
00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:45.600
<i>I can't do that, sir.</i>

591
00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:51.000
Well, look, John, we can't have
you runnin' around out there...

592
00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:54.400
wastin' friendly civilians.
There are no friendly civilians.

593
00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:56.100
<i>I'm your friend, Johnny.</i>

594
00:52:57.100 --> 00:52:59.600
<i>I was there with you knee-deep
in all that blood and guts.</i>

595
00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:02.200
<i>I covered your ass
more than once.</i>

596
00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:08.200
<i>Seems like bailin' you out of trouble
is gettin' to be a lifetime job for me.</i>

597
00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:11.200
There wouldn't be no trouble
except for that king-shit cop.

598
00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:14.200
<i>All I wanted
was something to eat,</i>

599
00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:16.800
<i>but the man kept pushing, sir.</i>

600
00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:19.200
You did some pushing
of your own, John.

601
00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:22.400
They drew first blood, not me.

602
00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:26.000
Look, Johnny, let me come in and
get you the hell out of there.

603
00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:29.600
They drew first blood.

604
00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:41.000
<i>Rambo, are you
still reading me?</i>

605
00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:47.000
Covey Leader to Raven.

606
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.600
Rambo, acknowledge.

607
00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:53.100
He's all finished, Colonel.

608
00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:55.600
We've got a real good
fix on him, though.

609
00:53:56.500 --> 00:53:59.000
Come first light, I'm gonna put
every man I got up on that ridge.

610
00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:01.600
Then we'll get him my way.

611
00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:05.500
<i>All right, look down. I want you
to stretch the skirmish line...</i>

612
00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:09.000
<i>right across this ridge.
Goddamn it.</i>

613
00:54:10.700 --> 00:54:12.000
Goddamn it.

614
00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:18.200
<i>Come on. Let's go.
Over here.</i>

615
00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:23.600
<i>Come on!
Move it!</i>

616
00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:27.200
<i>Let's go.</i>

617
00:54:28.100 --> 00:54:29.800
Hey, this guy got a gun?

618
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.200
<i>Watch it.
It's slippery.</i>

619
00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:33.400
<i>Come on.</i>

620
00:54:34.100 --> 00:54:35.400
<i>Watch your step.</i>

621
00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:37.800
<i>What was that?
What was that?</i>

622
00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:44.400
<i>To the left or the right?
Which way did he go?</i>

623
00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:46.700
<i>Toss it across.
Toss it.</i>

624
00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:48.700
<i>Which way?</i>

625
00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:41.000
Pa! Pa! Pa!

626
00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:42.400
There's a guy over there!
What happened, son?

627
00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:45.200
I see him! Over there!
I'll get him! I'll get him!

628
00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:49.600
Don't shoot! Cool down!
This way! Let's go!

629
00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:58.000
There he is! Come on!

630
00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:09.500
Whoo!

631
00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:16.300
Now we got him!

632
00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:23.100
Yes. Yes, I know exactly where it is.
Listen to me very carefully.

633
00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:26.300
Surround the area with every man
you've got, but don't move in.

634
00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:29.500
I repeat, don't move in. In fact,
don't do anything 'til I get there.

635
00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:32.700
And no shooting. I don't want
him dead. I want him alive.

636
00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:41.800
Get down!

637
00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:52.200
Keep firin'!

638
00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:56.200
Come on, guys.
Shoot!

639
00:56:57.500 --> 00:56:58.600
Come on!

640
00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:01.900
Oh, you guys are great.

641
00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:04.400
All right, Steve?
Yo?

642
00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:07.900
I want you and Bruce, head around these
trees, go to the front of that mine.

643
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.900
Screw that, Clinton.
I ain't goin' up there.

644
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:10.900
No way.

645
00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:16.800
Raymond?
What?

646
00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:19.800
I want you to go into that mine.
Oh, not me.

647
00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:23.000
What do you mean, "not me"?
Look, I do this part-time.

648
00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:26.500
I didn't come here to get killed. He's
probably in there just waitin' for us.

649
00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:28.600
What's wrong with you, Clinton?

650
00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:36.900
All right, Rambo? This is
Lieutenant Clinton Morgen,

651
00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:39.100
<i>National Guard Leader.</i>

652
00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:45.000
<i>Now, I'm giving you just
three-zero seconds to come on out!</i>

653
00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:48.500
<i>Who's got the rocket launcher?</i>

654
00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:51.000
<i>I do.
Come here, Earl.</i>

655
00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:52.100
<i>Great.</i>

656
00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:56.400
<i>Rambo, this is your last
chance to come out.</i>

657
00:57:57.800 --> 00:57:59.100
Maybe we should wait.

658
00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:02.300
Earl, this creep is a killer.

659
00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:05.000
Besides, I'm in charge,
and I say we blow it up.

660
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:07.400
Now fire that thing.

661
00:58:07.700 --> 00:58:09.700
Just let me
get out of the way first.

662
00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:33.100
Whoo!
Yeah!

663
00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:36.800
Give that man a cigar!

664
00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:37.900
Bull's-eye!

665
00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:21.000
Where the hell are they?
Up the hill about 500 yards.

666
00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:27.000
Move in a little
closer, just like Iwo Jima.

667
00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:30.100
I don't believe it.

668
00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:32.000
Idiots!
Steady. Got it.

669
00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:34.600
All right, Nick.
One more for Soldier of Fortune.

670
00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:36.100
Soldier of Fortune?

671
00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:39.600
Damn it! What the hell do you
think this is? Some kind of a circus?

672
00:59:39.700 --> 00:59:42.400
Get the hell out of here!

673
00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:44.300
Clinton,
Jesus...

674
00:59:45.100 --> 00:59:48.200
Didn't you get the word, Clinton? I told
you people to wait until I got up here!

675
00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:52.700
He was shootin' at us, Will. Come
on, I wasn't takin' any chances.

676
00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:55.200
Christ, what a mess.

677
00:59:57.700 --> 01:00:00.800
We're gonna have to dig his
body out of there right away.

678
01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:03.600
You can't get a dozer up here.

679
01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:05.100
You're going to have to find
somebody to dig him out.

680
01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:08.600
It's your mess, Clinton. You clean it up.
Will, come on!

681
01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:10.200
I gotta be back at the
drugstore tomorrow.

682
01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:13.900
Then you better get started
right away, Clinton!

683
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.100
Shit!

684
01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:04.500
Buried in a hole by a bunch
of goddamn weekend warriors.

685
01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:07.600
I thought you said he was
the best you ever trained.

686
01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:11.100
However he may have ended up, there
was a time when he was very special.

687
01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:15.100
Special, my ass. He's just another
drifter that broke the law.

688
01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:18.300
Vagrancy, wasn't it?
That's gonna look real good...

689
01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:20.000
on his gravestone at Arlington.

690
01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:23.900
"Here lies John Rambo, winner of
the Congressional Medal of Honor,

691
01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:27.400
<i>"survivor of countless
incursions behind enemy lines,</i>

692
01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:31.300
killed for vagrancy
in Jerkwater, U.S.A."

693
01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:34.200
Now don't give me
any of that crap, Trautman.

694
01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:38.200
You think Rambo was the only guy
who had a tough time in Vietnam?

695
01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:40.900
He killed a police officer,
for Christ sake!

696
01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:42.200
You're goddamn lucky
he didn't kill all of ya.

697
01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:04.100
This character, he comes waltzing in
here, full of all kinds of good advice.

698
01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:08.400
And wished we'd let the goddamn maniac
go loose so we can save our own asses!

699
01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:11.900
Well, we saved our asses, Colonel,
and we didn't let him go loose!

700
01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:13.900
The best man lost!

701
01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:16.200
And he doesn't like it!

702
01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:42.300
<i>That Rambo...
Digging trenches in hell.</i>

703
01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:45.200
<i>Why did we follow him up here?
This is so damn stupid.</i>

704
01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:47.300
<i>I wanna get outta here.</i>

705
01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:52.100
How ya doin', Will?
Hold my calls.

706
01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:13.700
Colonel?

707
01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:19.700
Have a seat.

708
01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:28.800
Oh, miss, would you
do this again, please?

709
01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:30.600
Hi, Sheriff.
And for my friend.

710
01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:32.900
Give me a shooter.
Wild Turkey.

711
01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:36.800
Look, if I was
out of line before,

712
01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:40.400
I... I just want
to apologize.

713
01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:45.400
None of that makes much
difference now, does it?

714
01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:48.100
Nah, I guess not.

715
01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:52.100
I suppose...

716
01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:55.900
I don't know.
I just feel...

717
01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:00.500
Like you were cheated
out of your chance.

718
01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:03.500
I wanted to kill that kid.

719
01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:07.100
I wanted to kill him
so bad I could taste it.

720
01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:10.800
Doesn't sit well
with that badge, hmm?

721
01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:14.700
It can get confusing sometimes.

722
01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:20.100
In Vietnam, you can bet that
Rambo and I got pretty confused.

723
01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:22.500
But we had orders.

724
01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:26.500
When in doubt, kill.

725
01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:32.000
What the hell,
you're a civilian.

726
01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:36.300
You can go home to your wife and your
house and your little flower garden.

727
01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:38.800
You're under no pressure
to figure all this out.

728
01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:41.700
What about you, Colonel? What did you
figure out from all of this, huh?

729
01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:44.100
What would you have done
with him if he came in?

730
01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:47.300
<i>Would you wrap your arms around
him, give him a big, sloppy kiss?</i>

731
01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:49.600
Or would you have
blown his brains out?

732
01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:01.200
I couldn't answer that
until I met him face-to-face.

733
01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:06.200
Yeah.
Well, there it is.

734
01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:10.700
It's just as well we never
got a chance to find out.

735
01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:11.900
Hmm.

736
01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:03.600
Drive.

737
01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:08.200
Don't look at me,
look at the road.

738
01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:10.300
That's how accidents happen.

739
01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:14.300
What's your name?
Ca... Cathcart, Robert A.

740
01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:17.400
All right, what do ya got
in the back, Robert A.?

741
01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:18.200
M60.

742
01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:24.000
Okay, Robert A., get outta the truck.

743
01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:26.900
Oh, please, I got no beef with you. No!
Go on! Move! Go!

744
01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:45.800
Whoa!

745
01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:52.200
<i>S.P. Car 1,
Charlie 5 to Central.</i>

746
01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:53.100
Want to turn that up?

747
01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:55.200
<i>Are we still on that three-way hookup?</i>

748
01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:57.300
<i>Sheriff Teasle's office.
He's not taking any calls.</i>

749
01:10:57.300 --> 01:11:00.600
<i>Roger. Still working.
What's your story, Steamboat?</i>

750
01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:03.300
<i>Looks like somebody
pulled the plug too soon.</i>

751
01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:06.700
<i>That Rambo guy...
is on the loose again.</i>

752
01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:09.200
<i>Shit.
Roger, Steamboat. This is Trapper.</i>

753
01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:11.500
<i>We're setting up roadblocks
on Highway 26.</i>

754
01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:14.600
Hey, Will, it's Rambo.
He's still around.

755
01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:33.700
<i>Heads up!
Get out of the way!</i>

756
01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:56.100
Holy fuck!

757
01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:58.700
All right, get out there right away.
Move!

758
01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:26.900
What the hell is goin' on?

759
01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:32.100
Watch yourself!
They're all gonna blow!

760
01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:44.200
Attention all civilians.

761
01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:46.900
For your own safety,

762
01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.500
please evacuate
the streets immediately.

763
01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:53.800
<i>Remain indoors until you
receive further instructions.</i>

764
01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.700
<i>I repeat, this is a
police emergency.</i>

765
01:15:56.900 --> 01:16:00.300
<i>Please evacuate the
streets immediately.</i>

766
01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:19.700
We found Rambo's body.

767
01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:23.500
As a matter of fact,
it stole an army truck,

768
01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:25.700
blew up a gas station
on the other side of town.

769
01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:28.800
The kid is resilient.

770
01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:32.200
Why don't forget what you're thinkin'
and clear out while you can?

771
01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:35.400
Get the fuck outta here, Trautman
and you take your advice with you.

772
01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:38.100
When I talked to you
earlier this afternoon,

773
01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:39.900
you knew he was still alive,
didn't you?

774
01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:44.600
I suspected.
Yeah, sure.

775
01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:48.100
Sure. That's why you stuck around.
You trained him.

776
01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:51.200
You taught him how to get out
of places like that cave.

777
01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:53.700
But he's not gonna
get out of this place.

778
01:16:54.700 --> 01:16:57.500
Teasle, you and all your men
couldn't handle him before.

779
01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:59.000
What makes you think
you can handle him now?

780
01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:02.300
Because God knows what
damage he's prepared to do.

781
01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:17.700
You're gonna die, Teasle.
Everybody dies.

782
01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:21.300
There's only one man in this
room that's got half a chance.

783
01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:23.500
That's not because
I'm better than he is.

784
01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:25.200
It's because he trusts me.

785
01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:28.300
See, I'm the closest thing
to family he has left.

786
01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:30.300
And that may be
all the edge I need.

787
01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:33.200
Jesus Christ, where
do you people come from?

788
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.200
Now this is my job, Trautman.
This is my town.

789
01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:44.900
And I'm not giving it up to you
or to Rambo or to anybody else.

790
01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:47.900
Now, you just stay
the hell out of my way.

791
01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:01.500
Get a little closer!
I can't! It's too goddamn hot!

792
01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:05.300
Will, this is Lester.
Do you copy? Over.

793
01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:09.100
Come on, let's go!

794
01:18:09.100 --> 01:18:10.800
Will, this is Lester.
Do you copy? Over.

795
01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:14.100
<i>Listen, Will,
we got some serious problems.</i>

796
01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:18.600
<i>The highway's been cut off. The truck's
out here, but we couldn't find the body.</i>

797
01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.300
<i>I repeat, no body.
It's totally burned out.</i>

798
01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:24.200
<i>Preston, get those
people outta here!</i>

799
01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:26.900
<i>Hey!
Move 'em back to the south side.</i>

800
01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:29.600
<i>Move back! Move back!
Listen, Will, we don't know how many...</i>

801
01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:32.200
<i>gasoline reservoirs there are
under those gas pumps.</i>

802
01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:40.000
<i>Do you copy? Over.
We got a reporter here.</i>

803
01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.400
<i>Preston, push them back!
I don't care who he is!</i>

804
01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:49.200
<i>Move them around!
Get the trucks to the other side!</i>

805
01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:51.300
<i>Come on!
Let's go!</i>

806
01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:53.700
<i>Will, do you copy?
Over.</i>

807
01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:46.100
Come on, damn it.

808
01:21:46.900 --> 01:21:48.600
Goddamn it!
Goddamn it!

809
01:24:25.300 --> 01:24:28.400
Go ahead.
Go ahead.

810
01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:31.100
<i>Go ahead, you crazy son of a bitch!
Finish me!</i>

811
01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:31.600
Rambo!

812
01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:34.600
Rambo, don't do it!

813
01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:38.800
<i>Listen to me, Rambo.
You have no chance.</i>

814
01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:41.300
<i>So drop your weapon.</i>

815
01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:45.600
I'm gonna order the chopper in
to fly you back to Bragg.

816
01:24:45.700 --> 01:24:49.200
Hold your fire!

817
01:24:50.900 --> 01:24:54.400
<i>Kern! Hold your fire.
Yes?</i>

818
01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
<i>Hold your fire. Hold your fire!</i>

819
01:24:57.800 --> 01:24:59.800
Think about what you're doing.

820
01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:04.100
The building's perimeter
is covered. No exits.

821
01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.600
<i>There are nearly 200 men
out there and a lot of M16s.</i>

822
01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:11.100
You did everything to make
this private war happen.

823
01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:13.000
You've done enough damage!

824
01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:16.300
This mission is over, Rambo.
Do you understand me?

825
01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:19.200
This mission is over!

826
01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:24.200
Look at 'em out there.

827
01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:28.400
Look at 'em!

828
01:25:31.500 --> 01:25:33.500
<i>If you don't end this now,
they're gonna kill you.</i>

829
01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:35.600
Is that what you want?

830
01:25:35.700 --> 01:25:37.900
<i>Back it up.
Watch yourselves.</i>

831
01:25:39.500 --> 01:25:40.900
<i>It's over, Johnny.</i>

832
01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:45.100
It's over!
Nothing is over! Nothing!

833
01:25:45.900 --> 01:25:47.500
You just don't turn it off!

834
01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:49.100
It wasn't my war!

835
01:25:50.100 --> 01:25:51.700
You asked me, I didn't ask you!

836
01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:53.700
And I did what
I had to do to win!

837
01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:55.100
But somebody
wouldn't let us win!

838
01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:59.700
Then I come back to the world, and I see
all those maggots at the airport...

839
01:26:00.300 --> 01:26:04.300
protestin' me, spittin'. Callin' me
"Baby Killer" and all kinds of vile crap!

840
01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:07.000
Who are they
to protest me, huh?

841
01:26:07.300 --> 01:26:09.800
Who are they, unless they've
been me and been there

842
01:26:09.900 --> 01:26:11.700
and know what the hell
they're yelling about!

843
01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:14.900
It was a bad time for everyone,
Rambo. It's all in the past now.

844
01:26:15.300 --> 01:26:17.900
For you! For me,
civilian life is nothing!

845
01:26:18.300 --> 01:26:19.700
In the field,
we had a code of honor:

846
01:26:19.900 --> 01:26:22.300
You watch my back,
I watch yours.

847
01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:25.100
Back here there's nothing!
You're the last of an elite group.

848
01:26:26.100 --> 01:26:27.400
Don't end it like this.

849
01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:30.600
Back there I could fly a
gunship, I could drive a tank.

850
01:26:30.700 --> 01:26:32.300
I was in charge of
million-dollar equipment!

851
01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:35.300
Back here I can't even
hold a job parking cars!

852
01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:41.100
Fuck it. Oh.

853
01:26:41.900 --> 01:26:43.800
Geez.
Oh, God.

854
01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:47.100
<i>Where is everybody?</i>

855
01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:50.900
<i>Oh, God.</i>

856
01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:55.700
I had a friend,
it was Danforth.

857
01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:58.500
I had all these guys, man.

858
01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:02.900
Back there I had all these fuckin'
guys... who were my friends

859
01:27:03.300 --> 01:27:05.400
'Cause back here
there's nothing.

860
01:27:05.900 --> 01:27:07.400
Remember Danforth?

861
01:27:08.100 --> 01:27:11.700
He wore this black headband. I took
one of his magic markers and it said,

862
01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:16.100
"If found, mail us to Las Vegas" 'cause
we were always talkin' about Vegas.

863
01:27:16.100 --> 01:27:19.800
<i>And his fuckin' car,
this red '58 Chevy convertible.</i>

864
01:27:19.900 --> 01:27:21.200
<i>He was talkin' about this car.</i>

865
01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:23.600
<i>He said we were gonna
cruise 'til the tires fall off.</i>

866
01:27:31.700 --> 01:27:34.400
We go in this bar in Saigon,
and this kid comes up...

867
01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:37.100
this kid's carrying
a shoe shine box.

868
01:27:37.100 --> 01:27:40.500
And he says,
"Shine, please. Shine."

869
01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:43.400
<i>I said no. He kept askin'
yeah and Joey said yeah.</i>

870
01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:46.000
And I went to get
a couple of beers.

871
01:27:46.100 --> 01:27:49.300
And the box is wired.
And he opened up the box.

872
01:27:49.700 --> 01:27:52.000
Fuckin' blew his body
all over the place.

873
01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:54.700
And he's layin' there.
He's fuckin' screamin'.

874
01:27:54.700 --> 01:27:57.800
There's pieces of him all over me.
Just... like this.

875
01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:01.500
And I'm tryin' to pull him off, you know?
And this is my friend that's all over me!

876
01:28:01.900 --> 01:28:04.800
<i>I've got blood and everything.
I'm tryin' to hold him together.</i>

877
01:28:04.900 --> 01:28:08.300
<i>I'm puttin' him together.
His fuckin' insides keep comin' out!</i>

878
01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:11.400
And nobody would help!
Nobody would help!

879
01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:14.000
He's sayin', "I wanna go home,
I wanna go home."

880
01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:17.800
He keeps callin' my name. "I wanna go
home, Johnny. I wanna drive my Chevy."

881
01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:20.500
I said, "Why?
I can't find your fuckin' legs.

882
01:28:21.300 --> 01:28:23.600
<i>I can't find your legs."</i>

883
01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:26.200
I can't get it out of my head.

884
01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:28.500
I dream it seven years.

885
01:28:29.300 --> 01:28:30.700
Every day I have this.

886
01:28:31.300 --> 01:28:33.700
Sometimes I wake up,
I don't know where I am.

887
01:28:34.700 --> 01:28:36.300
I don't talk to anybody.

888
01:28:37.700 --> 01:28:39.300
<i>Sometimes a day,</i>

889
01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:42.900
<i>sometimes a week.</i>

890
01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:46.700
I can't put it out of my mind.

891
01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:54.600
<i>Fuck it.</i>

892
01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:54.200
