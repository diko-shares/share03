- Mr. Gummer?

177
00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:43.910
Affirmative. Who's this?

178
00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.650
Dr. Rita Sims. I'm calling
from Nunavut Province, Canada.

179
00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:48.280
We're 67 degrees north.

180
00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:51.190
- That's the Canadian Arctic.
- Yes, it is.

181
00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.960
I'm the station leader of
an international research team.

182
00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:56.190
<i>We' re based at Boîte Canyon.</i>

183
00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.990
How'd you get this number?
You from the government?

184
00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.190
Is she hot?

185
00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.730
Well, I have an associate
familiar with your work.

186
00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.470
I think your associate
must be half a bubble off plumb.

187
00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.770
That was my first reaction,
but she's actually very bright.

188
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:10.840
She knows a lot
about Graboid mythology.

189
00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:14.310
Graboids are no myth,
but they're a desert phenomenon.

190
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.580
I think this is
a colossal time suck, Miss, uh...

191
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:19.380
Dr. Sims.

192
00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:22.680
Graboids do not and cannot
exist in the Arctic, Dr. Sims!

193
00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:24.850
- Impossible.
- Ask her if she's hot.

194
00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:27.620
Improbable but not impossible.

195
00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:29.220
- Who's this?
- This is Valerie.

196
00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:31.830
First, let me say that,
as a major Graboid enthusiast,

197
00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:35.600
I have admired your work
for years. Here's what I know.

198
00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:38.300
Graboids are subterranean
worm-like predator

199
00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:42.400
unlike any other life form cataloged
in Earth's genetic or fossil record.

200
00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:44.940
<i>When fully grown,
a Graboid can reach up</i>

201
00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:47.310
to 10 meters in length
and weigh up to 20 tons.

202
00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.680
Their semi-rigid internal structure
is covered by a leathery carapace.

203
00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:53.660
<i>They're daytime hunters
and have no eyes,</i>

204
00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:56.690
but what's most fascinating
to me about their predatory acuity

205
00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:58.920
is that it's based on vibration.

206
00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.890
Go on. I'm listening.

207
00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:03.990
They have a massive black armored beak
and two hooked mandibles,

208
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.460
one on either side of their jaw.

209
00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:09.600
<i>The species is Precambrian and have long
and powerful snake-like tentacles,</i>

210
00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:12.070
<i>which can reach three meters
to ensnare their prey.</i>

211
00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:13.640
If you'd like,
I can give you the 411

212
00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:15.040

subspecies

213
00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:17.840
known as the Ass Blaster
a.k.a. <i>Mexicana Combustus.</i>

214
00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:20.880
You're a treasure-trove of
Graboidology, Miss, but I...

215
00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:24.510
You've hunted and killed them
on two different continents, Mr. Gummer.

216
00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.380
That's why I insisted
that we call.

217
00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:29.420
But why are you so sure
this is a Graboid attack?

218
00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:32.820
The kill site
has all the telltale signs.

219
00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:35.420
Except for location.

220
00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:38.460
I don't know.
Call it a gut feeling, intuition.

221
00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:41.370
We need your help, Mr. Gummer,
and we need it ASAP!

222
00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:44.200
<i>Think of the adventure,
Graboids in the Arctic.</i>

223
00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:46.610

a whole new ballgame.

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:32.510
get you free
of the taxman, dude!

234
00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:34.420
Let's be honest. You've got
a lot of red in your ledger.

235
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:37.620
My financial status
is none of your damn beeswax.

236
00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:39.150
And you'll just be in the way.

237
00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.520
Oh, like I was
in South Africa? Huh?

238
00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:45.230
That was a one-off!
Nothing more.

239
00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:49.230
You're looking at this through the wrong
end of the telescope here, friend.

What about your legacy, huh?

241
00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:51.930
What about it?

242
00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:54.470
Do you know of any other
Graboid hunters out there?

243
00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.500
Uh, I don't.

Come on, man, teach me!
Pay it forward.

247
00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.480
Oh, I'm not dead yet.

248
00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:11.020
I know, and I'm not interested in
talking about your mortality, either,

249
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:13.450
but think about it.
Who's gonna fill your shoes

250
00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:16.560

or outgun these beasts, huh?

I've got to
tell you something.

And you're my heir apparent.
Is that it?

You already led me through
one Graboid gauntlet.

- Exactly my point.

combat primer.

You don't mind if we help
ourselves now, do you?

345
00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.700
Well, there's a matter
of payment, eh?

346
00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:57.700
Put it on my tab.

347
00:21:57.710 --> 00:21:59.640
BURT: And who might
you be?

348
00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:08.810
I'm your next-door neighbor

349
00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:10.710
while you're up here
on your little worm hunt.

350
00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:14.660
But there's no welcome mat
on my doorstep, so tread lightly.

351
00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:18.690
A piece of advice, Mr. Gummer.

352
00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:22.160
You stay out of my way
and pay your taxes.

353
00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:25.300
Consider yourself
properly warned.

354
00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:27.860
Do I know you?

355
00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:30.670
I don't know. Do you?

356
00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:35.500
Since we're neighbors,
here's some neighborly advice.

357
00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:38.870
Beat a retreat until I get
this area cleared out.

358
00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:43.110
Retreat? Hell, no. We're just
getting started up here.

359
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:45.610
Then find a safe place
to hunker down.

360
00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:48.020
Consider yourself
properly warned.

361
00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:55.290
You know that skid mark?

362
00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:56.890
What can you tell me
about him?

363
00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:58.860
MAC: Well, rumor has it
he's up here working

364
00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:01.500
on some Area 51 stuff.

365
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:04.630
Some joint US-Canadian
turd factory

366
00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:08.540
being developed by Harpo...
Darpo...

367
00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:09.940
You mean DARPA?

368
00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:12.510
That's the one! Know them?

369
00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:16.220
Yeah, they're the acronym
for evil.

370
00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.420
(GRUNTS)

371
00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:29.260
You must be Valerie?

372
00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:32.090
At your service. And thanks
for answering our SOS.

373
00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:34.360
Yeah, my call sign,
these days.

374
00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:36.930
This is Aklark.
He's our resident local boy.

375
00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:40.070
Hey, Mac. I saw you came in
a bit hectic there, huh?

376
00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.410
Yeah, just a little bit.

377
00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:45.070
Did you guys just come
from Burning Man, or...

378
00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.540
How's it, Mr. Burt?

379
00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:50.680
Wow! They even know you
in Canada!

380
00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:53.450
You failed to tell me
about the AB infestation.

381
00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:55.520
- We have Ass Blasters?
- Yeah.

382
00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:57.220
It ain't a polar bear, girl.

383
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:59.050
Mom and Dad aren't
gonna believe it.

384
00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:00.550
"Mom and Dad"?

385
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.860
Here's a blast from the past,
Mr. Gummer.

386
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:04.760
I'm Val and Rhonda's daughter.

387
00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:08.330
No! Val and Rhonda from
the OG Graboid apocalypse?

388
00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:10.600
Crazy, huh?
You must be Travis.

389
00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:11.770
I am.

390
00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:15.800
Uh... I kind of lost track
of your parents over the years.

391
00:24:15.810 --> 00:24:19.610
It's okay. They're easy
to lose track of, especially Val.

392
00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:22.740
Let's get you back to the station.
Everybody's waiting.

393
00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:25.150
He's not
the keeping-in-touch type.

394
00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.650
Come on.

395
00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:35.790
Ah, bam!

396
00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:37.290
Dang!

397
00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.130
Aw, man!

398
00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:14.860
(GRUNTS)

399
00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:19.270
(PANTING)

400
00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:25.710
I see you've come up north
loaded for bear, Mr. Burt.

401
00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:28.680
Yeah, BSA .303. Nice.

402
00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:30.180
It'll kill most varmints.

403
00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:32.510
Yeah, well, for the varmints
we're hunting,

404
00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:35.820
that's like shooting
a slingshot at a Sherman tank.

405
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:38.790
I thought it'd be colder than a
reindeer's ball bag up here.

406
00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:40.050
We're in the middle
of an Arctic heat wave,

407
00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:42.220
which has greatly accelerated
the snow melt.

408
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:45.090
Hell, I'm hotter
than a 50 cal on full auto!

409
00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:47.660
Mr. Gummer,
glad you could make it.

410
00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:50.200
Welcome to the Boîte Canyon
Arctic Research Station

411
00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:53.230
or, like we used to call it,
science at the edge of the world.

412
00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.870
You must be, uh,
Dr. Rita Sims?

413
00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.100
- Good to meet you.
- Yeah.

414
00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:58.440
This is Dr. Ferezze.

415
00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:00.810
- Charles Ferezze.
- Doc.

416
00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:02.010
How was your flight in?

417
00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:05.750
Well, let's just say, uh,
we hit some chop.

418
00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:08.880
We blew the engine.

419
00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:10.990
Actually, we came
under Ass Blaster attack,

420
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.420
and during the ensuing
aerial dogfight, the engine was blown.

421
00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:17.760
- An Ass Blaster?
- Yeah.

422
00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:19.460
Blew the engine?

423
00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:22.130
But you have to fly me
back to Montreal so I can report

424
00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.770
to the powers that be about
the recent turn of events.

425
00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:29.270
Well, they'll just have to wait till
I get this puppy airborne again.

426
00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:31.510
I can't stay here
one more minute!

427
00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:35.650
Excuse me. I've got
an engine to fix.

428
00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:37.880
DR. FEREZZE: Excuse me.
(LAUGHS)

429
00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:41.280
Dr. Ferezze, he startles
at the drop of a feather.

430
00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:43.690
I'm sorry.
We haven't met yet.

431
00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:46.050
BURT: Oh, Travis Welker,
my, uh...

432
00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:48.860
My wing, uh...
Wingman.

433
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:50.530
Thank you for coming.

434
00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:54.430
I've got to go inside,
get the lay of the land.

435
00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:58.370
Sunset at 3:48 a.m.

436
00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:01.470
Well, it's the Land of
the Midnight Sun, Mr. Welker.

437
00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:05.510
Are you saying that the sun
is never going down on me?

438
00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:08.180
Well, it's never gonna go
below the horizon,

439
00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:10.710
if that's what you're asking.

440
00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:13.510
RITA: We sent a three-man
drill team to the glacial field

441
00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:15.750
about a half a day
up mountain from here.

442
00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:17.820
You have three KIA?

443
00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:19.050
Killed in action.

444
00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:21.460
Whoa, that's a big
10-4, good buddy.

445
00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:24.120
- Name's Swackhamer.
- Swackhamer.

446
00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:25.690
I hammered-and-nailed
this place together.

447
00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:28.300
You need to know anything,
I'm your guy.

448
00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:32.470
There's two that we can
verify dead, one assumed dead.

449
00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:34.170
Verified? How?

450
00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:35.470
Well, from the kill site.

451
00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:38.140
Rita and her crew managed
to recover a severed head,

452
00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:41.120
a partially eaten pelvis,
and a half-eaten testicle.

453
00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:43.980
How do you recover
a half-eaten testicle?

454
00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:47.150
Now, where's all
the snow, Dr. Sims?

455
00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:50.680
This year in particular has been one
of the warmest on record up here.

456
00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:52.490
Meet Hart Hansen, Mr. Gummer.

457
00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:55.720
He's a PhD in Geomorphology
from the University of Cambridge.

458
00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:57.960
Ah, yeah, airplane boy.

459
00:27:57.970 --> 00:28:01.230
It's an RC. Kind of a hobby.

460
00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:04.070
It's actually a habit, um...

461
00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:07.200
Okay, it's an addiction. Anyway,

462
00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:08.670
it's a pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Gummer.

463
00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:10.170
I'm sure you'll find
that Boîte Canyon

464
00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:12.510
is a very unique
geological phenomenon.

465
00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:14.880
VALERIE: This perennially
frozen tundra is interrupted

466
00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:17.510
for approximately
10 square kilometers by thawed soil.

467
00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:20.010
Thawed?
It's bone dry out there.

468
00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:22.050
The Meltwater Hot Springs
are a pleasant symptom

469
00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:24.590
of geothermal heat, which warms
the Earth from deep beneath the land

470
00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:25.820
that we're standing on.

471
00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:27.190
That explains the ABs.

472
00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.420
Ass Blasters!

473
00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:30.370
(ALL LAUGHING)

474
00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:33.530
- Ass Blasters...
- You think this is funny?

475
00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:39.940
These creatures are no joke.
They are all-go, no-quit killing machines.

476
00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:42.140
Now, I'm sorry for the loss
of your friends,

477
00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:44.570
but if you don't do exactly
as I say,

478
00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:46.740
they won't be the last
to die around here.

479
00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:49.410
Not funny, Mr. Gummer.
We get it.

480
00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:52.080
The permafrost at a higher
elevation is melting,

481
00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:56.860
so the tundra is more easily breached.
Ergo, Graboids.

482
00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:01.060
You're telling me melting ice caps
and warmer temperatures

483
00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:05.390
are causing this, uh,
Graboid Arctic stampede?

484
00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:06.890
Kind of, but there's more.

485
00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:09.630
(SCOFFS) Enlighten me.
Why here?

486
00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.700
Evolution, Mr. Gummer.

487
00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:13.100
There's one thing
Nature has taught us,

488
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:15.940
and that's life can expand
into new territories.

489
00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:17.810
Maybe these are
the first Graboids.

490
00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:21.440
- Yeah, like pre-Precambrian.
- VALERIE: Exactly.

491
00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:25.080
And maybe they migrated south millions,
maybe even billions of years ago

492
00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:26.810
and evolved into a desert creature.

493
00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:29.880
And now, after countless
giga-annum lying dormant in ice...

494
00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:31.290
They've awakened.

495
00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:35.390
(SIGHS) Come on, this sounds
like a bunch of sassafras!

496
00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:37.870
It does sound sassafrassy!

497
00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:41.200
Dr. Sims, a word?

498
00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:43.500
(WHIRRING)

499
00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:48.200
How much longer?

500
00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:50.100
(WHIRRING STOPS)

501
00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:53.970
I've got to cold-stitch the intake
manifold, rebuild the carb.

502
00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:56.210
Look, if you don't get
this clunker in the air soon, I'll...

503
00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:58.190
You'll what, Mr. Freeze?

504
00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:03.620
Ferezze. Dr. Charles Ferezze.

505
00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:10.260
What is it?

506
00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:18.460
DARPA.

507
00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.810
(WHISPERS)
What are they doing here?

508
00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:27.680
(VEHICLE APPROACHING)

509
00:30:29.050 --> 00:30:31.150
- Oh, them?
- Shh!

510
00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:33.710
Yes, them.

511
00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:35.980
What's your association
with them?

512

That's exactly what I'm saying
you're thinking. Can you do it?

858
00:52:26.370 --> 00:52:27.660
I've done more with less.

859
00:52:27.670 --> 00:52:30.100
Yeah, but if
it doesn't work, we die.

860
00:52:30.110 --> 00:52:33.970
So what the hell, Burt?
Have you ever nailed Jell-O to a wall?

861
00:52:34.010 --> 00:52:35.330
I'm not sure
how that's relevant.

862
00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:37.800
It's relevant
because I did it.

863
00:52:37.810 --> 00:52:40.010
And guess what? It stuck.

864
00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:42.310
You know why?
Because everyone said I couldn't.

865
00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:44.650
All right, I got it.
I got it!

866
00:52:45.090 --> 00:52:48.280
And we've got a plan.
We're off to the hangar.

867
00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:50.780
Teams of two.
Travis, you, and Dr. Sims.

868
00:52:50.790 --> 00:52:52.820
Swackhamer, you're with me.

869
00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:56.130
Wingman, we're gonna need
a diversion!

870
00:52:56.270 --> 00:52:57.750
I'm on it.

871
00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:00.090
I'm gonna pretend
I didn't just hear you leave me out

872
00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:02.370
because I'm coming
on this worm hunt.

873
00:53:03.010 --> 00:53:06.570
Elk hunter, huh?
Think you can bang on this short arm?

874
00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:10.200
Piece of cake. You zero that scope
for distance or dangerous game?

875
00:53:10.350 --> 00:53:12.510
- What do you think?
- Stupid question.

876
00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:15.480
Mind if I tweak it for
my preferred point of impact?

877
00:53:17.390 --> 00:53:21.050
Dad and I always zeroed our scopes
at 2.5 inches high at 100 yards.

878
00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:23.020
Well, whatever floats your boat.

879
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:25.550
You're on overwatch.
Take Vargas and go on the roof.

880
00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:26.720
Roger that.

881
00:53:26.730 --> 00:53:29.490
And hold on tight, huh?
She'll kick some!

882
00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:30.990
Got you.

883
00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:33.790

884
00:53:37.870 --> 00:53:39.400

885
00:53:39.410 --> 00:53:41.030
I'm fine.

886
00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:42.570
You make ready.

887
00:53:42.750 --> 00:53:44.870
Okay, you ready, Dr. Sims?

888
00:53:45.010 --> 00:53:48.880
Oh, shit.
Look what the cat dragged in.

889
00:53:49.090 --> 00:53:51.440
- Oh, good. You're here.
- Mr. Cutts.

890
00:53:51.450 --> 00:53:54.610
I just lost my top scientist
at the Meltwater Hot Springs.

891
00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:57.780
You just got in over your head
and had to punt, huh?

892
00:53:57.790 --> 00:54:00.190

894
00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:04.720
What, you think I'm actually
controlling these...

895
00:54:04.730 --> 00:54:08.560
Yeah, but of course you would.
Your psych eval suggested as much.

896
00:54:08.570 --> 00:54:10.000
You had me profiled?

897
00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:13.900
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but this is not the Island of Dr. Moreau.

899

My mission here
is more elevated than that.

900
00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:23.810
Oh, yes. No DARPA skunk
works in the hopper, huh?

901
00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:29.180

902

You know, that's a good idea,
but bio-weapons are not my thing.

903
00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:34.590
I'm here with an engineering team

904
00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:36.620
to assess the purity
of the groundwater

905
00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:40.290
and to design an aquifer to move it out
of the Arctic and into civilization.

906
00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:41.930
This is about water?

907
00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:44.000
Water is the new oil,
and, as you may have noticed,

908
00:54:44.010 --> 00:54:46.370
the Arctic has it
in abundance now.

909
00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:48.230

one of those creatures

910
00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:50.740

- You're too kind.
- MR. CUTTS: You're right.

1377
01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:14.030
This species will make
an exceptional bio-weapon.

1378
01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:17.330
When it comes to Graboids,
I'm rarely wrong, Mr. Cutts.

1379
01:29:17.340 --> 01:29:20.340
Mmm-hmm.
With the right neuro-implant,

1380
01:29:20.350 --> 01:29:23.510
it could be a bunker-buster
for God and country.

1381
01:29:23.750 --> 01:29:25.140
What do you think?

1382
01:29:25.150 --> 01:29:26.740
I was right about you all along.

1383
01:29:26.750 --> 01:29:31.450
You and your DARPA minions,
you're a bunch of malevolent ineptoids!

1384
01:29:31.460 --> 01:29:33.480
(REMOTE CONTROL
AIRPLANE WHIRRING)

1385
01:29:34.390 --> 01:29:36.560
What the hell was that,
Mr. Gummer?

1386
01:29:38.570 --> 01:29:41.030
That, sir, is the trigger.

1387
01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:44.190
And I am the finger.

1388
01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:46.330
Look, I don't know
what you're doing,

1389
01:29:46.340 --> 01:29:49.700
but I'd strongly
advise you not to do it!

1390
01:29:49.710 --> 01:29:51.680
Oh?

1391
01:29:53.050 --> 01:29:55.470
That Graboid is
US government property!

1392
01:29:55.480 --> 01:29:57.680
Hate to be a buzzkill.

1393
01:29:57.720 --> 01:29:59.380
Shoot it.
Blow it out of the sky!

(BEEPS)

1396
01:30:08.900 --> 01:30:10.450
Yes!

1397

(LAUGHING)

1398
01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:20.130
Graboids don't make
good pets, Mr. Cutts.

1399
01:30:20.140 --> 01:30:21.400
AKLARK: Preach on it, Burt!

1400
01:30:21.410 --> 01:30:24.240
(ALL LAUGHING)
Yeah!

1401
01:30:24.750 --> 01:30:26.100
TRAVIS: Yeah!

1402
01:30:26.110 --> 01:30:30.440
MAC: Mr. Gummer,
my plane's all packed and ready to go.

1403
01:30:30.450 --> 01:30:33.250
- Roger that.
- MAC: By the way,

1404
01:30:33.290 --> 01:30:34.780
nice work.

1405
01:30:34.790 --> 01:30:36.250
(CHUCKLES)

1406
01:30:36.260 --> 01:30:38.750
Dad was right.
You are a hard-ass!

1407
01:30:39.430 --> 01:30:41.450
Tell your dad I said, "Hey."

1408
01:30:41.460 --> 01:30:43.830
Tell him not to drop in.

1409
01:30:43.900 --> 01:30:45.560
He's not really
the dropping-in kind of guy.

1410
01:30:45.570 --> 01:30:47.930
He's more of
the barging-in type.

1411
01:30:48.270 --> 01:30:50.930
This is gonna be one hell
of a story to tell back home.

1412
01:30:50.940 --> 01:30:54.410
Tell him I said you're a better shot
than he ever was.

1413
01:30:54.540 --> 01:30:56.270
Thanks, Mr. Gummer.

1414
01:30:57.480 --> 01:30:59.410
Call me Burt!

1415
01:31:03.750 --> 01:31:06.840
You know I won't be
in the Arctic Circle forever, right?

1416
01:31:07.350 --> 01:31:10.520
Six months,
I'll be back in the States.

1417
01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:13.150
You trying to get sweet
with me?

1418
01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:15.050
Definitely.

1419
01:31:15.460 --> 01:31:17.050
Never gonna happen.

1420
01:31:18.270 --> 01:31:19.990
I think it might.

1421
01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:25.400
Thanks.

1422
01:31:26.270 --> 01:31:27.800
For everything.

1423
01:31:35.450 --> 01:31:37.180
(EXHALES)

1424
01:31:41.150 --> 01:31:44.820
Travis, what have you learned
from me?

1425
01:31:44.990 --> 01:31:47.650
Uh, to not trust anyone
or anything ever?

1426
01:31:47.660 --> 01:31:49.990
You call that a goodbye kiss?

1427
01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:55.330
A man brings a big bore .44 Magnum
to a fight, not some broke dick .22.

1428
01:31:55.340 --> 01:31:57.060
Broke dick?
That was sweet dick.

1429
01:31:57.070 --> 01:31:58.800
- Oh, was it?
- Yeah.

1430
01:31:58.810 --> 01:32:02.970
'Cause that sorely lacked any kind
of velocity or stopping power,

1431
01:32:02.980 --> 01:32:05.870
not to mention
maximum penetration.

1432
01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:07.140
Okay, it's a little late to have

1433
01:32:07.150 --> 01:32:10.010
the guns-and-ammo
talk, Burt. All right?

1434
01:32:11.790 --> 01:32:13.340
Pathetic.

1435
01:32:31.170 --> 01:32:32.870
(ALL EXCLAIM)

1436

(EXHALES DEEPLY)

1437
01:32:56.830 --> 01:32:58.760
- It was better.
- Better?

1438
01:32:58.770 --> 01:33:03.090
It was no .44 Magnum.
.357, maybe.

1439
01:33:03.100 --> 01:33:04.460
Dude, what do you know
about kissing?

1440
01:33:04.470 --> 01:33:08.340
I know enough not to unholster
my weapon unless I'm prepared to use it.

1441
01:33:09.110 --> 01:33:11.070
It's nice to see you back
to your old self, Burt.

1442
01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:14.770
What do you say we get on home
and get ourselves some real sunshine, huh?

1443
01:33:16.420 --> 01:33:18.910
Sounds like perfection, Pops.

1444
01:33:26.230 --> 01:33:27.990
Pops.
