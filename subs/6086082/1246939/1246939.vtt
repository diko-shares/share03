1
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.770
Whoever heard of a heatwave
in the Arctic?

2
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.570
Welcome to the new normal.

3
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.760
We're standing on a gigantic ice cap,
and it's 32 Fahrenheit.

4
00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.850
Welcome to the Arctic summer.

5
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.380
Fahrenheit?

6
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.750
Wait, did you just use
that antiquated Imperial measurement?

7
00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.350
Yeah, I did, Sweden.

8
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.120
I'm from Norway, A-hole.
Not Sweden!

9
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.350
Is there
any difference?

10
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.920
You Americans! You're so out of step
with the rest of the world.

11
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.720
You're a scientist,
for God's sake.

12
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.560
Glaciologist.

13
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.130
You two knob jockeys
sound like a couple of Sheilas.

14
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.900
Let's get these core samples
and get back to the outpost.

15
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.640
Guys, we hit something.

16
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.280
This is some mean ice.

17
00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.750
That's why they call it
the Old Cold!

18
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.920
Yeah, well, I reckon just
increase the bit speed.

19
00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.860
Let's blast right through it.

20
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.320
Hey, guys?

21
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.370
I'm getting a seismic spike
in the ice.

22
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.740
Yeah, well, it's probably
just an isostatic rebound.

23
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.040
Like hell, it is.

24
00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.610
I'm getting a big-ass
magnetic anomaly on my screen.

25
00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.140
Whatever it is, it's alive,
and it's big.

26
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.680
There are no big life forms
that live in solid ice.

27
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.210
Maybe the backscatter effect
brought up a rock formation.

28
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.920
Yeah, and maybe
it's the Easter Bunny!

29
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.620
This is not a rock, and it sure
as shit isn't the Easter Bunny.

30
00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:35.720
Dumbass!

31
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.770
Check it out.

32
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.450
Aussie!

33
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.230
Aussie? Aussie?
Aussie, do you copy?

34
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.330
What the hell?

35
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.340
- What...
- Get it out! Get it out!

36
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.110
Come on, get it out. Come on!
Come on! Come on! Come on, Yank!

37
00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.910
No! No!

38
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.880
Yankee!

39
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.570
Yank!

40
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.580
Yank?

41
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.450
No.

42
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.630
No!

43
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.090
No!

44
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.730
Really, Gummer?
A motion detector?

45
00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.640
Perfection.

46
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:42.070
Man alive,
it's hot as balls out there!

47
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.040
Hands where I can
see them, partner.

48
00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.080
Oh, gee-whiz, Gummer!
You know who I am!

49
00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.750
It's me,
Special Agent Dalkwed.

50
00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.090
Do it, Agent Dickweed.

51
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.030
Are you threatening
a federal officer?

52
00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.060
That all depends, Taxman.

53
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.500
Sticks and stones.
Is that a pellet gun, Gummer?

54
00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.800
You bet
your sweet ass it is!

55
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.170
Oh, since when
do you play with toys?

56
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.440
Since none of your damn business.
You armed?

57
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.340
Of course, I'm armed.

58
00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.640
All Special Agents with
the United States Treasury are armed.

59
00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:18.810
You know that.

60
00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.880
Special Agent!
You're a bean counter.

61
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:25.420
This here is private property
in an open-carry state.

62
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.020
And you wouldn't happen
to have any financial interest

63
00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:29.720
in said property,
now would you?

64
00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.460
Nope! Go slap a lien
somewhere else.

65
00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:34.590
Already have.

66
00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:37.160
Hey.

67
00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.100
I see you've changed teams.

68
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:40.930
Hmm?

69
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.370
No, just hats!

70
00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.370
Well, it was a miracle
the Cubbies won that series.

71
00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.470
And frankly, Gummer,
that's what you're gonna need,

72
00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.250
a miracle.

73
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:56.520
'Cause right now,
your ass is in my hands.

74
00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:58.750
Your point, Dickweed?

75
00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.920
Your tax position has been
deemed frivolous by the IRS

76
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.960
and your property has hereby
been seized.

77
00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:07.830
What? You can't!

78
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.000
I can, and I did!

79
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.330
The IRS owns you, Gummer,

80
00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:16.870
until such time as we can arrange
for confiscation of any and all items

81
00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.970
deemed suitable
for government auction.

82
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.940
You parasitic son of a bitch!

83
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:22.710
Yeah, your...

84
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:30.780
Your well-endowed battery of firearms
might raise enough to make a dent

85
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:34.150
in your failure to file
penalties and interest.

86
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.320
<i>I detect the odorous stench
of Schadenfreude, Agent Dickweed!</i>

87
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.660
I will see you in court!

88
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:43.870
In court? Oh. Oh, no!

89
00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:46.940
We're way past that, Gummer.

90
00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:48.700
Way past.

91
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:50.270
Out of here!

92
00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.840
Goodbye, Gummer.

93
00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:55.410
And don't let the door
dislodge that poker up your ass!

94
00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.010
Oh, I'll be really careful.

95
00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:13.660
- Another satisfied customer?
- What?

96
00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.500
Did you miss me?

97
00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.370
Yeah, like a boil on my ass.

98
00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.200
I see you got
the supply req.

99
00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:27.410
Oh, yeah. That eighth text
was a charm.

100
00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:30.840
"Hey, welcome home,
sonny boy!"

101
00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:34.710
"Oh, good to see you".
"How long's it been?"

102
00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.750
"Four or five weeks?" "Okay.
How'd the video shoot go?"

103
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.950
Fascist jackals!

104
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.590
Ooh, Government plates.
That can't be good.

105
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.760
Let me guess. IRS?

106
00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:50.430
They've got no right to waltz in here
and seize a man's property.

107
00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.600
Come on, Burt. You've been flipping off
the Feds longer than Wesley Snipes.

108
00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:54.870
That's got to be a record.

109
00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.470
This is the very thing that
sparked the Boston Tea Party.

110
00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.810
No taxation
without representation!

111
00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:04.750
It's a good thing Jodi decided
to stay at that law firm in Reno, huh?

112
00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:07.810
- Lets you squat here?
- Nobody's squatting.

113
00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.450
I'm managing the store now.

114
00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:10.880
Really? Congratulations.

115
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:12.950
And I really love what
you've done with the place.

116
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.920
You really put the hyphen back
in anal-retentive. Jeez.

117
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:18.460
I can do
without the sarcasm, son.

118
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.990
Oh, come on, Burt.
Don't be hurt.

119
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.060
All right, now that I'm back,
let's hit that reset button, huh?

120
00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:25.930
Put some fresh content
up on YouTube,

121
00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.130
try and resurrect
that Bull's-Eye Brand.

122
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:32.070
Not doing prepper videos anymore.
My director quit on me.

123
00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.300
No, he didn't.
He's right here.

124
00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:36.580
I just had a small
mental health break.

125
00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:39.580
What's up with that hat?
Wait a minute.

126
00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.650
You change teams?

127
00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:44.320
No, just hats!

128
00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:47.450
Take it easy, Burt.
Look, I know you hate taking direction,

129
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:49.720
and my style's way too
improvisational for you, okay?

130
00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:52.360
Lord, you're giving me
a headache.

131
00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:54.560
Come on, Burt,
meet me in the middle.

132
00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:58.200
Make sure you put $5
in that cash box.

133
00:09:58.210 --> 00:09:59.700
For what?

134
00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:02.930
That beer doesn't come free.

135
00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:04.900
You're closing up?

136
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:06.440
Dude, it's not Miller time yet.

137
00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:07.810
You can't find your beach.

138
00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:09.440
Time for some shut-eye.

139
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:12.580
Since when do you "shut-eye"
in the middle of the afternoon?

140
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:14.780
Since you showed up!

141
00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.790
You wonder why I go
to strip clubs!

142
00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.840
What the hell happened here?

143
00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:32.130
Something attacked them
from under the ice.

144
00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.770
It can't be!

145
00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:05.790
Chang's.

146
00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.900
Yo, Burt! What's up?

147
00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:14.700
Calisthenics.
Feel free to join in.

148
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:16.470
I think I'll pass.

149
00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.500
You wanna earn your keep,
go stock some shelves.

150
00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:21.970
I'd love to, but you've got
a phone call.

151
00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:23.640
Take a message.

152
00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:25.310
I tried,

153
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.650
but there's a lady
holding on the line,

154
00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:30.650
who's got a very sexy
phone voice, by the way.

155
00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:33.890
She told me to tell you
that they've got, uh...

156
00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:35.690
I can't read my writing.

157
00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:39.460
What does that word...
What does that say? That she's got, uh...

158
00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.730
- Graboids? Where?
- Mr. Gummer?

159
00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:44.160
Affirmative. Who's this?

160
00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:46.900
Dr. Rita Sims. I'm calling
from Nunavut Province, Canada.

161
00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:48.530
We're 67 degrees north.

162
00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:51.440
- That's the Canadian Arctic.
- Yes, it is.

163
00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:54.210
I'm the station leader of
an international research team.

164
00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:56.440
<i>We' re based at Boîte Canyon.</i>

165
00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:58.240
How'd you get this number?
You from the government?

166
00:12:58.250 --> 00:12:59.440
Is she hot?

167
00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:01.980
Well, I have an associate
familiar with your work.

168
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:04.720
I think your associate
must be half a bubble off plumb.

169
00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:08.020
That was my first reaction,
but she's actually very bright.

170
00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.090
She knows a lot
about Graboid mythology.

171
00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:14.560
Graboids are no myth,
but they're a desert phenomenon.

172
00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:17.830
I think this is
a colossal time suck, Miss, uh...

173
00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.630
Dr. Sims.

174
00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:22.930
Graboids do not and cannot
exist in the Arctic, Dr. Sims!

175
00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.100
- Impossible.
- Ask her if she's hot.

176
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:27.870
Improbable but not impossible.

177
00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.470
- Who's this?
- This is Valerie.

178
00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:32.080
First, let me say that,
as a major Graboid enthusiast,

179
00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:35.850
I have admired your work
for years. Here's what I know.

180
00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:38.550
Graboids are subterranean
worm-like predator

181
00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:42.650
unlike any other life form cataloged
in Earth's genetic or fossil record.

182
00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:45.190
<i>When fully grown,
a Graboid can reach up</i>

183
00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.560
to 10 meters in length
and weigh up to 20 tons.

184
00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:50.930
Their semi-rigid internal structure
is covered by a leathery carapace.

185
00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:53.910
<i>They're daytime hunters
and have no eyes,</i>

186
00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.940
but what's most fascinating
to me about their predatory acuity

187
00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:59.170
is that it's based on vibration.

188
00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:01.140
Go on. I'm listening.

189
00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:04.240
They have a massive black armored beak
and two hooked mandibles,

190
00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:05.710
one on either side of their jaw.

191
00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:09.850
<i>The species is Precambrian and have long
and powerful snake-like tentacles,</i>

192
00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:12.320
<i>which can reach three meters
to ensnare their prey.</i>

193
00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:13.890
If you'd like,
I can give you the 411

194
00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:15.290
On the morphological
subspecies

195
00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:18.090
<i>known as the Ass Blaster
a.k.a. Mexicana Combustus.</i>

196
00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:21.130
You're a treasure-trove of
Graboidology, Miss, but I...

197
00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:24.760
You've hunted and killed them
on two different continents, Mr. Gummer.

198
00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:26.630
That's why I insisted
that we call.

199
00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:29.670
But why are you so sure
this is a Graboid attack?

200
00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:33.070
The kill site
has all the telltale signs.

201
00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.670
Except for location.

202
00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:38.710
I don't know.
Call it a gut feeling, intuition.

203
00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.620
We need your help, Mr. Gummer,
and we need it ASAP!

204
00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:44.450
<i>Think of the adventure,
Graboids in the Arctic.</i>

205
00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:46.860
This could be
a whole new ballgame.

206
00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.250
Batter up!

207
00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.390
Yes.

208
00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:55.460
You never asked
if she was hot!

209
00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:20.150
- Where are you going?
- Round two! I'm coming with.

210
00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.890
Request denied.

211
00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:25.460
What? Come on, here,
stop being Burt for a minute,

212
00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:27.130
and logic this thing out
with me.

213
00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:30.630
This is our chance to revive
Burt Gummer's Bull's-Eye Brand,

214
00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.760
get you free
of the taxman, dude!

215
00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:34.670
Let's be honest. You've got
a lot of red in your ledger.

216
00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:37.870
My financial status
is none of your damn beeswax.

217
00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.400
And you'll just be in the way.

218
00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:42.770
Oh, like I was
in South Africa? Huh?

219
00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:45.480
That was a one-off!
Nothing more.

220
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:49.480
You're looking at this through the wrong
end of the telescope here, friend.

221
00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:50.980
What about your legacy, huh?

222
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:52.180
What about it?

223
00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:54.720
Do you know of any other
Graboid hunters out there?

224
00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:56.750
Uh, I don't.

225
00:15:57.070 --> 00:15:59.820
I know, you know,
Bigfoot hunters... No!

226
00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:02.890
You're Burt Gummer.
You're a one-off!

227
00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:06.000
Come on, man, teach me!
Pay it forward.

228
00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:07.730
Oh, I'm not dead yet.

229
00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:11.270
I know, and I'm not interested in
talking about your mortality, either,

230
00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.700
but think about it.
Who's gonna fill your shoes

231
00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:16.810
when you can no longer outrun
or outgun these beasts, huh?

232
00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:18.440
I've got to
tell you something.

233
00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:21.750
Burt Gummer's got
some big-ass shoes to fill.

234
00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:23.280
Size 12s.

235
00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:25.280
I've seen you
in the locker room.

236
00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:27.290
And you're my heir apparent.
Is that it?

237
00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.020
You already led me through
one Graboid gauntlet.

238
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:33.620
- There's a lot you still don't know.
- Exactly my point.

239
00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:37.070
Learning can be fun!
Rosetta Stone me, dawg.

240
00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:40.530
It was a decent enough
combat primer.

241
00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:42.470
Hell, yeah, it was!
I was your wingman.

242
00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.440
Wingman?
More like wingnut!

243
00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:46.570
Come on, that's...

244
00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:48.840
That's a little harsh,
I think.

245
00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:52.440
Damn it!

246
00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:57.120
Are you willing to follow orders?

247
00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:58.950
I mean, sometimes, I don't...

248
00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:02.790
Look, the most important
six inches on the battlefield

249
00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.270
are between your ears.
You got that?

250
00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:08.860
I'd like to think I have more.
I think I'm 6.5.

251
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:10.660
Don't crack wise with me.

252
00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:12.030
Sir, yes, sir!

253
00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.230
And have you filled out

254
00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:18.940
the requisite non-resident
special exemption RCMP-5590 form?

255
00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:20.240
Sir...

256
00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:25.240
- What?
- The RCMP-5590 form!

257
00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:28.810
For that firearm you're
planning on bringing into Canada.

258
00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:30.520
No.

259
00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:34.830
Well, then you better download
one and fill it out pronto.

260
00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:37.190
Grab your arctic gear.

261
00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:39.960
Man!

262
00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:04.680
Welcome to
the Great White North, eh!

263
00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:07.350
Otherwise known
as Nowheresville.

264
00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:10.420
You're about 1,000 miles
north of there.

265
00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:12.560
You're somewhere
between, uh,

266
00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:16.060
Ain't-Never-Been
and Don't-Wanna-Go.

267
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:17.930
Where are
all the glaciers?

268
00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:23.170
Melting. Sled dog unemployment's
at an all-time high.

269
00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:25.740
How much longer
till we're there?

270
00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:29.410
Not far.
Just around the bend.

271
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:31.580
Where's your GPS?

272
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:34.080
You're in the Arctic Circle.

273
00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:38.120
Satellites up here
are more miss than hit.

274
00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:41.590
But don't worry.
It's all up here.

275
00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.590
That's reassuring.

276
00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.690
How is it back there,
Mr. Gummer?

277
00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:48.660
My seismic vibration monitor
is completely useless.

278
00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:52.930
Yeah, well, you can log in to the
inter-Web when we get you on station.

279
00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:57.600
- Peachy.
- Hey, I'm a big fan of your series.

280
00:18:57.610 --> 00:19:02.870
I loved that episode on dried meats
and insects as proteins.

281
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:07.510
I see you're smuggling home-brew
grain alcohol into dry territory.

282
00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:11.620
Well, the local tribal authority
are a bit blue-nosed,

283
00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:14.790
so I'm forced to bring it
in under the radar.

284
00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.190
Don't ask, don't tell, right?

285
00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.530
Yeah.

286
00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:26.560
Travis!

287
00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:29.740
I see it.

288
00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.640
- It can't be.
- It is.

289
00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:34.510
- It is what?
- We got a hostile aerial incursion.

290
00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:36.170
What's your altitude?

291
00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:37.340
1,400 feet.

292
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:41.910
I suggest you take evasive
action and put this plane on the ground.

293
00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:44.650
Ass Blasters in the Arctic?

294
00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.260
They're keying in
on your engine!

295
00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:54.730
- Yeah, they're heat seekers.
- Who's they?

296
00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:57.030
Ass Blasters!

297
00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.640
- Bird strike.
- We've lost the engine.

298
00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:09.940
No shit, Sherlock!

299
00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:12.610
Get this down! Now!

300
00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:15.610
Stand by for some chop!

301
00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:17.380
Does that mean crash?

302
00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:21.020
Gravity never loses!

303
00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:24.050
The best we can hope for
is a draw!

304
00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:28.190
- Brace for impact!
- Impact? What impact?

305
00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:47.650
And we're here!

306
00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:51.150
Whoa. We're so
out of here!

307
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:08.760
Oh, no.

308
00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:13.170
Here they come,
the men in black.

309
00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:31.060
Well, well, well!
What do we have here?

310
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.860
Tom and Jerry?

311
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.760
Frick and Frank?

312
00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.930
No, more like
Butch and Sundance.

313
00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:38.560
Starsky and Hutch.

314
00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:41.230
Do I smell alcohol?

315
00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:44.940
My bird runs on bio-fuel.

316
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:48.210
And you're bootlegging moonshine
into a First Nations territory?

317
00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:49.910
That is a big time no-no!

318
00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:52.610
You don't mind if we help
ourselves now, do you?

319
00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:55.950
Well, there's a matter
of payment, eh?

320
00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.950
Put it on my tab.

321
00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:59.890
And who might
you be?

322
00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:09.060
I'm your next-door neighbor

323
00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:10.960
while you're up here
on your little worm hunt.

324
00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:14.910
But there's no welcome mat
on my doorstep, so tread lightly.

325
00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:18.940
A piece of advice, Mr. Gummer.

326
00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:22.410
You stay out of my way
and pay your taxes.

327
00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:25.550
Consider yourself
properly warned.

328
00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:28.110
Do I know you?

329
00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:30.920
I don't know. Do you?

330
00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:35.750
Since we're neighbors,
here's some neighborly advice.

331
00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:39.120
Beat a retreat until I get
this area cleared out.

332
00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:43.360
Retreat? Hell, no. We're just
getting started up here.

333
00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.860
Then find a safe place
to hunker down.

334
00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:48.270
Consider yourself
properly warned.

335
00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.540
You know that skid mark?

336
00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:57.140
What can you tell me
about him?

337
00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:59.110
Well, rumor has it
he's up here working

338
00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:01.750
on some Area 51 stuff.

339
00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:04.880
Some joint US-Canadian
turd factory

340
00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:08.790
being developed by Harpo...
Darpo...

341
00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:10.190
You mean DARPA?

342
00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.760
That's the one! Know them?

343
00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:16.470
Yeah, they're the acronym
for evil.

344
00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:29.510
You must be Valerie?

345
00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:32.340
At your service. And thanks
for answering our SOS.

346
00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:34.610
Yeah, my call sign,
these days.

347
00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:37.180
This is Aklark.
He's our resident local boy.

348
00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:40.320
Hey, Mac. I saw you came in
a bit hectic there, huh?

349
00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:42.660
Yeah, just a little bit.

350
00:23:42.661 --> 00:23:45.320
Did you guys just come
from Burning Man, or...

351
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:47.790
How's it, Mr. Burt?

352
00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:50.930
Wow! They even know you
in Canada!

353
00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:53.700
You failed to tell me
about the AB infestation.

354
00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:55.770
- We have Ass Blasters?
- Yeah.

355
00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:57.470
It ain't a polar bear, girl.

356
00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.300
Mom and Dad aren't
gonna believe it.

357
00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:00.800
"Mom and Dad"?

358
00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:03.110
Here's a blast from the past,
Mr. Gummer.

359
00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.010
I'm Val and Rhonda's daughter.

360
00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:08.580
No! Val and Rhonda from
the OG Graboid apocalypse?

361
00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:10.850
Crazy, huh?
You must be Travis.

362
00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:12.020
I am.

363
00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:16.050
Uh... I kind of lost track
of your parents over the years.

364
00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:19.860
It's okay. They're easy
to lose track of, especially Val.

365
00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:22.990
Let's get you back to the station.
Everybody's waiting.

366
00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:25.400
He's not
the keeping-in-touch type.

367
00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:26.900
Come on.

368
00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:36.040
Ah, bam!

369
00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:37.540
Dang!

370
00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:44.380
Aw, man!

371
00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.960
I see you've come up north
loaded for bear, Mr. Burt.

372
00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:28.930
Yeah, BSA .303. Nice.

373
00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:30.430
It'll kill most varmints.

374
00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.760
Yeah, well, for the varmints
we're hunting,

375
00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:36.070
that's like shooting
a slingshot at a Sherman tank.

376
00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:39.040
I thought it'd be colder than a
reindeer's ball bag up here.

377
00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:40.300
We're in the middle
of an Arctic heat wave,

378
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:42.470
which has greatly accelerated
the snow melt.

379
00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:45.340
Hell, I'm hotter
than a 50 cal on full auto!

380
00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:47.910
Mr. Gummer,
glad you could make it.

381
00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.450
Welcome to the Boîte Canyon
Arctic Research Station

382
00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:53.480
or, like we used to call it,
science at the edge of the world.

383
00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:56.120
You must be, uh,
Dr. Rita Sims?

384
00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:57.350
- Good to meet you.
- Yeah.

385
00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.690
This is Dr. Ferezze.

386
00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:01.060
- Charles Ferezze.
- Doc.

387
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:02.260
How was your flight in?

388
00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:06.000
Well, let's just say, uh,
we hit some chop.

389
00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:09.130
We blew the engine.

390
00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:11.240
Actually, we came
under Ass Blaster attack,

391
00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:15.670
and during the ensuing
aerial dogfight, the engine was blown.

392
00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:18.010
- An Ass Blaster?
- Yeah.

393
00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:19.710
Blew the engine?

394
00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:22.380
But you have to fly me
back to Montreal so I can report

395
00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:25.020
to the powers that be about
the recent turn of events.

396
00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:29.520
Well, they'll just have to wait till
I get this puppy airborne again.

397
00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:31.760
I can't stay here
one more minute!

398
00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:35.900
Excuse me. I've got
an engine to fix.

399
00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:38.130
Excuse me.

400
00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:41.530
Dr. Ferezze, he startles
at the drop of a feather.

401
00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:43.940
I'm sorry.
We haven't met yet.

402
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.300
Oh, Travis Welker,
my, uh...

403
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:49.110
My wing, uh...
Wingman.

404
00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:50.780
Thank you for coming.

405
00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:54.680
I've got to go inside,
get the lay of the land.

406
00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:58.620
Sunset at 3:48 a.m.

407
00:26:58.690 --> 00:27:01.720
Well, it's the Land of
the Midnight Sun, Mr. Welker.

408
00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:05.760
Are you saying that the sun
is never going down on me?

409
00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:08.430
Well, it's never gonna go
below the horizon,

410
00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:10.960
if that's what you're asking.

411
00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:13.760
We sent a three-man
drill team to the glacial field

412
00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:16.000
about a half a day
up mountain from here.

413
00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:18.070
You have three KIA?

414
00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:19.300
Killed in action.

415
00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:21.710
Whoa, that's a big
10-4, good buddy.

416
00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:24.370
- Name's Swackhamer.
- Swackhamer.

417
00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:25.940
I hammered-and-nailed
this place together.

418
00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:28.550
You need to know anything,
I'm your guy.

419
00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:32.720
There's two that we can
verify dead, one assumed dead.

420
00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:34.420
Verified? How?

421
00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:35.720
Well, from the kill site.

422
00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:38.390
Rita and her crew managed
to recover a severed head,

423
00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:41.370
a partially eaten pelvis,
and a half-eaten testicle.

424
00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:44.230
How do you recover
a half-eaten testicle?

425
00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:47.400
Now, where's all
the snow, Dr. Sims?

426
00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:50.930
This year in particular has been one
of the warmest on record up here.

427
00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:52.740
Meet Hart Hansen, Mr. Gummer.

428
00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:55.970
He's a PhD in Geomorphology
from the University of Cambridge.

429
00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:58.210
Ah, yeah, airplane boy.

430
00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:01.480
It's an RC. Kind of a hobby.

431
00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:04.320
It's actually a habit, um...

432
00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:07.450
Okay, it's an addiction. Anyway,

433
00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:08.920
it's a pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Gummer.

434
00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:10.420
I'm sure you'll find
that Boîte Canyon

435
00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:12.760
is a very unique
geological phenomenon.

436
00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:15.130
This perennially
frozen tundra is interrupted

437
00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:17.760
for approximately
10 square kilometers by thawed soil.

438
00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:20.260
Thawed?
It's bone dry out there.

439
00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:22.300
The Meltwater Hot Springs
are a pleasant symptom

440
00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:24.840
of geothermal heat, which warms
the Earth from deep beneath the land

441
00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:26.070
that we're standing on.

442
00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:27.440
That explains the ABs.

443
00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:28.670
Ass Blasters!

444
00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:33.780
- Ass Blasters...
- You think this is funny?

445
00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:40.190
These creatures are no joke.
They are all-go, no-quit killing machines.

446
00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:42.390
Now, I'm sorry for the loss
of your friends,

447
00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.820
but if you don't do exactly
as I say,

448
00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:46.990
they won't be the last
to die around here.

449
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.660
Not funny, Mr. Gummer.
We get it.

450
00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:52.330
The permafrost at a higher
elevation is melting,

451
00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:57.110
so the tundra is more easily breached.
Ergo, Graboids.

452
00:28:58.010 --> 00:29:01.310
You're telling me melting ice caps
and warmer temperatures

453
00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:05.640
are causing this, uh,
Graboid Arctic stampede?

454
00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:07.140
Kind of, but there's more.

455
00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:09.880
Enlighten me.
Why here?

456
00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:11.950
Evolution, Mr. Gummer.

457
00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.350
There's one thing
Nature has taught us,

458
00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:16.190
and that's life can expand
into new territories.

459
00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.060
Maybe these are
the first Graboids.

460
00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:21.690
- Yeah, like pre-Precambrian.
- Exactly.

461
00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:25.330
And maybe they migrated south millions,
maybe even billions of years ago

462
00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:27.060
and evolved into a desert creature.

463
00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:30.130
And now, after countless
giga-annum lying dormant in ice...

464
00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:31.540
They've awakened.

465
00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:35.640
Come on, this sounds
like a bunch of sassafras!

466
00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:38.120
It does sound sassafrassy!

467
00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:41.450
Dr. Sims, a word?

468
00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:48.450
How much longer?

469
00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:54.220
I've got to cold-stitch the intake
manifold, rebuild the carb.

470
00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:56.460
Look, if you don't get
this clunker in the air soon, I'll...

471
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:58.440
You'll what, Mr. Freeze?

472
00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:03.870
Ferezze. Dr. Charles Ferezze.

473
00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:10.510
What is it?

474
00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:18.710
DARPA.

475
00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:23.060
What are they doing here?

476
00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:31.400
- Oh, them?
- Shh!

477
00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:33.960
Yes, them.

478
00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:36.230
What's your association
with them?

479
00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.140
They're our
research neighbors.

480
00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:41.410
Why are we whispering?
They can't hear us.

481
00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:44.040
When did they arrive?

482
00:30:44.050 --> 00:30:46.680
They arrived a couple
of months ago.

483
00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:49.110
They're working on some
US-Canadian project.

484
00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:50.310
It's very hush-hush.

485
00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.750
Why? What?

486
00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:57.220
Bio-weapons is what.

487
00:30:57.230 --> 00:31:00.220
I'll bet you a dollar
to a donut hole we've zeroed in

488
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:01.960
on DARPA's testing ground.

489
00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:04.730
You think that
our research neighbors

490
00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:07.930
are breeding these creatures
as bio-weapons?

491
00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:10.470
Bingo! This is
the killing ground,

492
00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.600
and you're the guinea pigs.

493
00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:14.270
I think you're reaching.

494
00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:18.180
It's a verifiable fact that
DARPA started training dolphins

495
00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:21.280
as bomb-carriers
during Vietnam.

496
00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:26.780
More lately, they've been outed
for weaponizing cyborg insects.

497
00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:32.690
No, ma'am, I wouldn't put anything
past these black-hat Mengeles.

498
00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:36.430
We got Ass Blasters on campus!

499
00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:46.140
Dr. Ferezze is out there
with that thing.

500
00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:49.040
Oh, Lord. That guy's
turned into a real ass-ache.

501
00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:51.240
What's the 20 on that AB?

502
00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:59.150
That flaming sphincter
is on the roof!

503
00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:06.520
Eyes! We need
eyes on that roof!

504
00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:08.500
I'm bringing up
the roof cam!

505
00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:25.750
All right, listen up!

506
00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:29.480
If there are Ass Blasters on station,
Graboids aren't far behind.

507
00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:34.150
They respond to seismic vibrations,
so everyone stay still.

508
00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:45.830
Dr. Ferezze. Just the man
I wanted to see.

509
00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:49.210
The bodies, or what's left of them,
are ready for transport.

510
00:32:49.211 --> 00:32:52.400
When you have a minute,
we need to go through the details again.

511
00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:54.910
We've been through it.
It was an apparent Graboid attack.

512
00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:56.140
Graboid?

513
00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:16.740
Locked and loaded.

514
00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:09.080
That thing just took down
our comms tower.

515
00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:10.410
We've got no talk.

516
00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:12.120
Our data-link
and NetCam are down, too.

517
00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:14.250
How'd that
ass-wipe get out there?

518
00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:18.160
Now I've got to save his sorry butt!
I'm going outside.

519
00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:37.610
You ever seen
an Ass Blaster before?

520
00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:39.140
- Nope.
- Yeah.

521
00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:40.740
This is a first.

522
00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:44.980
They're pretty cool, actually,
but they're mean, and they stink.

523
00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:47.620
I had a boyfriend like that once.

524
00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:54.190
You single?

525
00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:56.460
Are you trying
to get sweet with me?

526
00:34:56.470 --> 00:34:59.230
- Definitely.
- It's not gonna work.

527
00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:28.190
Doc! Doc!

528
00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:31.560
Doc! Grow a spine, huh?

529
00:35:31.570 --> 00:35:32.660
Look at me.

530
00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:34.500
I have balls of steel.
Say it!

531
00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:36.900
I have balls of steel.

532
00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:39.200
My balls are stainless steel!

533
00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:41.870
My balls are stainless steel!

534
00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:45.910
My balls are in
the Guinness Book of Balls!

535
00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:49.780
My balls are in
the Guinness Book of Balls!

536
00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:52.220
Right! You put this on.

537
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:55.590
- Yes.
- It'll hide your heat signature, huh?

538
00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:58.920
Now, look. You stick with me
like a shadow. You hear that?

539
00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:00.020
Yes.

540
00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:02.260
Now, put that dick
back in your pants

541
00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:04.030
- and do what I do, right?
- Yes, sir.

542
00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:05.160
- Roger?
- Roger.

543
00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:07.470
- Roger that. Let's go.
- Okay.

544
00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:14.570
Come on, soldier.
Hoods up!

545
00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:46.870
What the hell?

546
00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:59.120
Suck on this, bird brain!

547
00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:09.960
Go away, sucker!

548
00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:03.780
How are you
feeling, Mr. Gummer?

549
00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:10.050
What's going on?

550
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:12.360
- You just had surgery.
- What?

551
00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:14.920
Arthroscopic surgery.
To remove a mondo tapeworm

552
00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:17.790
that was causing a cluster-fete
in your intestines.

553
00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:20.330
I know. Gross, huh?

554
00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:23.900
Oregon State.
Corvallis, right?

555
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:26.340
Yup. Go Beavers!

556
00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:29.540
You know, my dad's been
telling me stories about you

557
00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:31.510
since I could bounce
on his knee and...

558
00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:34.110
I still can't believe
Val McKee's your father!

559
00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:36.510
He's more of a dad, really.

560
00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:38.480
Crazy uncle, actually.

561
00:38:38.490 --> 00:38:39.920
Wild, huh?

562
00:38:39.930 --> 00:38:43.290
Your father was the most
brilliant underachiever lever met.

563
00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:46.260
Yeah. That's what Mom
always says.

564
00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:48.360
He always told me
what a hard-ass you were.

565
00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:51.340
I mean, are.

566
00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:53.500
Oh, no way. No way!
Are those...

567
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:56.700
Graboid skin? Yeah.
Dad made them for Mom.

568
00:38:56.710 --> 00:39:00.340
She handed them down to me.
Pretty indestructible.

569
00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:02.270
What are you doing up here?

570
00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:06.240
Internship. I'm doing my Masters
in Mathematical Geosciences.

571
00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:07.840
How are you feeling, Burt?

572
00:39:07.850 --> 00:39:09.980
Speaking of underachievers.

573
00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:14.520
I am as strong
as a fifth of whiskey, Wingman.

574
00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:18.190
Really? 'Cause you looked slower
than the Mississippi out there.

575
00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:21.720
Where's my munitions,
my combat vest, my clothes, huh?

576
00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:23.260
To your left.

577
00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:30.870
Well, feel better, Mr. Gummer.

578
00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:33.070
All right. Thank you, Miss McKee.

579
00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:35.770
You can call me Val.

580
00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:43.410
What's going on with you, Burt?

581
00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:45.880
It's not like you to take
a knee on the field.

582
00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:47.620
We need to talk.

583
00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:58.790
Where'd you get that HK91?

584
00:39:59.570 --> 00:40:01.130
Mr. Gummer?

585
00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:04.270
There's something
that you need to see.

586
00:40:38.650 --> 00:40:42.640
The water levels dropped 15 centimeters
since our last measurement.

587
00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:47.180
The samples have detected
a new chemical element in the soil gas.

588
00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:49.350
<i>Can you determine what it is?</i>

589
00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:54.760
Uh... The computer's
reading it as HCO2H.

590
00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.320
Formic acid?

591
00:40:57.500 --> 00:40:58.790
Yeah.

592
00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:01.360
<i>Yeah, and it's a highly
concentrated dose.</i>

593
00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:04.100
The acidity in the pH
is off the charts.

594
00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:15.370
What the hell was that?

595
00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:26.320
You hear that?

596
00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:52.810
<i>Get out! Get out now!</i>

597
00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:04.220
What the hell?

598
00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:45.960
What is it?

599
00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:48.900
You've been infected, Mr. Gummer,

600
00:42:48.910 --> 00:42:51.530
by what appears to be a
parasitic organism that is

601
00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:54.070
quite hostile and has
an extremely slow gestation.

602
00:42:56.250 --> 00:42:58.150
What's the bad news?

603
00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:02.180
Well, unfortunately, it secretes
a neurotoxin at a certain maturation,

604
00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:03.550
killing the host.

605
00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:07.050
Killing the host?
You mean, Burt being the host?

606
00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:16.260
We've identified the toxin
as originating from a Graboid.

607
00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:17.530
A Graboid?

608
00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:19.600
- What...
- Just indulge me.

609
00:43:23.710 --> 00:43:26.300
Blood behind the eye caused
by cerebral inflammation.

610
00:43:26.310 --> 00:43:28.140
Advanced stage.
It's not good.

611
00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:30.310
You're gonna need antibodies.

612
00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:32.010
Well, how do we get them?

613
00:43:32.590 --> 00:43:34.070
From a Graboid.

614
00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:37.420
Maybe we can get one
to stop by the blood bank.

615
00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:42.690
How the hell did you
get infected by a Graboid?

616
00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:55.560
I was in the belly
of the beast.

617
00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:02.310
Okay, so we kill a Graboid.
We get it done.

618
00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:03.470
I got this, Burt.

619
00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:07.890
The antibodies need to be extracted
from a live Graboid to be viable.

620
00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:10.010
A live Graboid?

621
00:44:11.390 --> 00:44:13.290
Mission: Impossible.

622
00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:16.560
You plan on throwing a lasso
over its neck?

623
00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:20.160
If you'll excuse me,
I need to do a perimeter sweep.

624
00:44:20.170 --> 00:44:23.030
I don't think you understand
the urgency of your condition.

625
00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:25.700
Don't let the urgent
get in the way of the important.

626
00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:32.210
Your body is failing, Mr. Gummer.

627
00:44:32.211 --> 00:44:34.040
Bullshit! I want a second opinion.

628
00:44:34.050 --> 00:44:35.910
Yeah, I know that's all macho
and everything, Burt,

629
00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:37.710
but I happen to care
about your health!

630
00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:39.340
Go care someplace else.

631
00:44:39.350 --> 00:44:41.550
That's a dick thing to say.

632
00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:48.720
No bad seed
shall go unpunished!

633
00:44:58.240 --> 00:44:59.530
Get it off of me!

634
00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:04.000
Hang on.

635
00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:05.880
Please don't let go!

636
00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:08.240
- Hold on!
- Don't let go!

637
00:45:09.550 --> 00:45:12.570
- My God!
- Please, don't let go!

638
00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:14.580
- Please, don't let go.
- I got you.

639
00:45:14.590 --> 00:45:17.250
- Hold me! Hold me!
- Shit! I got you.

640
00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:19.220
No!

641
00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:31.990
All right!
Block that window!

642
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.400
Okay, everyone,
buckle your chinstraps

643
00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:38.030
and pack a meat sandwich!
We are under attack.

644
00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:40.210
Secure all doors and windows!

645
00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:42.070
Well, this is just great.

646
00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:45.440
We're under attack by
a hostile underground life form.

647
00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:47.480
We're all going to die!

648
00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:49.780
Listen to me, Doc.

649
00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:51.480
Take a couple of
tablespoons of cement

650
00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:53.950
and harden the hell up, huh?

651
00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:57.120
Okay, look, anybody
with a weapon, load it up.

652
00:45:57.130 --> 00:46:00.790
We have the sharp end of the stick.
Whatever you got, use it!

653
00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:03.770
Easy, there, cowgirl!

654
00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:07.260
I can't get this seismic
vibration monitor working.

655
00:46:07.270 --> 00:46:09.230
Our data-link and NetCam
are down, Mr. Gummer.

656
00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:11.430
Yeah, the Ass Blaster tore our
comms tower apart last night.

657
00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:12.540
Can you fix it?

658
00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:14.770
Swackhamer's been
working on it all morning, but...

659
00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:18.240
The HF antenna's totally destroyed.
Coax has been severed.

660
00:46:18.250 --> 00:46:19.610
The grid pack dish
is totally shot.

661
00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:21.380
All right, how long
will it take to fix?

662
00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:23.710
- A day, at least.
- All right.

663
00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:25.850
Iridium satellite phone?

664
00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:30.350
- Who took the sat phone?
- I saw Dr. Ferezze with it earlier.

665
00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:32.460
Oh, Ferezze flew the coop.

666
00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:35.390
All right, find him and get
that sat phone to me ASAP!

667
00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:38.090
It's our lifeline out of here.
We've got to call in Evac

668
00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:39.860
and get these kids
someplace safe!

669
00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:41.660
I can drop an elk at 800 yards

670
00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:43.470
and field dress it
in less than 30 minutes.

671
00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:45.030
Maybe that'll pull you
out of your worry well.

672
00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:46.700
We're up for this, Mr. Gummer.

673
00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:48.840
Copy that, Miss McKee.

674
00:46:48.850 --> 00:46:52.940
We are flying blind.
Advantage, Graboid.

675
00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:56.510
I was never properly briefed
on the lay of the land, Dr. Sims.

676
00:46:56.690 --> 00:46:58.050
We are here.

677
00:46:58.060 --> 00:47:01.580
There are mountains to our
east, west, north, and south.

678
00:47:01.590 --> 00:47:02.850
It's a true box canyon.

679
00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:06.660
Total geographic isolation.
Déjà-freaking-vu!

680
00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:09.560
This is the bunkhouses.
That's DARPA encampment.

681
00:47:09.570 --> 00:47:12.500
The hangar's about 120 meters
to our direct front.

682
00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:13.960
Aflac's down there.

683
00:47:13.970 --> 00:47:16.000
It's Aklark!

684
00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:19.370
Make yourself useful, Wingman.
Give the hangar a holler.

685
00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:21.040
With what,
a cup and a string?

686
00:47:21.050 --> 00:47:22.740
Use the walkie-talkie.

687
00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:31.950
Yo, North Star One, this is
North Star Base. You copy?

688
00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:35.080
You got Mac, North Star One.
Send your traffic. Over.

689
00:47:35.090 --> 00:47:37.120
Look, shut it down now,
all right?

690
00:47:37.130 --> 00:47:40.190
Stop all work
and stay inside.

691
00:47:40.430 --> 00:47:42.860
- What's this?
- A road.

692
00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:45.230
You mean washboard.
The road's out.

693
00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:47.900
Landslide last winter.
It's totally impassable.

694
00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:50.800
This whole base is like
open range for a Graboid.

695
00:47:50.810 --> 00:47:52.600
Wait a second.
You're telling me

696
00:47:52.610 --> 00:47:55.810
we're smack dab in the middle
of a kill zone and no way out?

697
00:48:05.790 --> 00:48:07.450
Everybody freeze!

698
00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:25.930
Valerie.

699
00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:38.820
I think it's leaving.

700
00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:40.350
No.

701
00:48:40.590 --> 00:48:43.990
It's caught wind of
another vibration.

702
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.860
Something's moving.

703
00:48:46.070 --> 00:48:48.090
Or someone.

704
00:48:53.610 --> 00:48:56.100
I can't find Dr. Ferezze
in the bunkhouse.

705
00:48:56.110 --> 00:48:58.910
That cheese-dick
gone AWOL again?

706
00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:02.700
Oh!

707
00:49:09.490 --> 00:49:10.980
Jeez.

708
00:49:13.530 --> 00:49:15.760
Dr. Ferezze!

709
00:49:15.830 --> 00:49:16.890
Hart, no!

710
00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:19.920
Back here! Don't follow
stupid with stupid.

711
00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:31.000
Dr. Ferezze!

712
00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:34.540
Come back, Dr. Ferezze!

713
00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:46.150
Dr. Ferezze,
where are you going?

714
00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:47.620
Anywhere but here!

715
00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:49.590
Just calm down and think,
Dr. Ferezze.

716
00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:51.520
There's nowhere
for you to go!

717
00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:52.990
I'll take my chances.

718
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.190
- Hart!
- Here it comes!

719
00:49:58.170 --> 00:50:01.200
Dr. Ferezze!
Please, don't do this!

720
00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:03.870
Don't start the car!

721
00:50:04.410 --> 00:50:06.700
<i>- Please!
- Adiés, amigo.</i>

722
00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:08.680
Dr. Ferezze!

723
00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:16.250
Shit!

724
00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:39.300
Damn, I don't have a shot!

725
00:50:46.590 --> 00:50:49.180
Dr. Ferezze!

726
00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:57.860
Inside! Everyone, now!
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

727
00:51:03.770 --> 00:51:05.630
This shit just got real!

728
00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:08.130
I can't believe what that thing did
to Dr. Ferezze.

729
00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:10.800
They just came out of hibernation and,
based on their body mass index,

730
00:51:10.810 --> 00:51:12.540
those creatures
need to eat a lot.

731
00:51:12.550 --> 00:51:14.470
- How many are there?
- It's impossible to tell...

732
00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:16.910
without my
seismic vibration monitor.

733
00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:18.770
Well, we can't stay here.

734
00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:22.610
Copy that. We've got weapons,
but not enough for these bad boys.

735
00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:24.380
The bigger the problem,
the bigger the hammer.

736
00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:25.650
Yeah? What've you got
in mind?

737
00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:27.720
There's a couple of cases
of dynamite in the hangar.

738
00:51:27.730 --> 00:51:30.320
Petrol, tools,
bear bangers, odds and ends.

739
00:51:30.330 --> 00:51:33.920
There's enough stuff to MacGyver
a bomb we can stuff down their throats!

740
00:51:33.930 --> 00:51:35.690
Sounds like that's our FOB.

741
00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:37.160
One problem.

742
00:51:37.170 --> 00:51:39.730
The hangar's got a compacted
chip-stone floor.

743
00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:41.500
Oh, come on, man.
They're gonna be like

744
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:43.130
sand sharks
bobbing for apples.

745
00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:45.030
Yeah, and we'll be
the Granny Smiths.

746
00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:47.370
This floor is 1.2 meters
above the ground,

747
00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:49.140
supported by
a steel substructure.

748
00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:51.670
Those things won't be able
to knock this place down.

749
00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:53.180
Yeah, but it's only
a matter of time

750
00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:56.180
before they come blasting through
the floor and eat our lunch.

751
00:51:56.190 --> 00:51:58.910
I've got an idea.
The generator's in the hangar, right?

752
00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:02.220
Yeah. Triple-phase power,
63-amp cables.

753
00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:03.820
According to
these blueprints,

754
00:52:03.830 --> 00:52:05.850
this hangar's got
a deep-pile foundation.

755
00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:08.490
Yeah, steel caissons going
directly into the bedrock.

756
00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:09.560
Drilled it myself.

757
00:52:09.570 --> 00:52:13.160
You think you can re-route
the power so it goes to the steel caissons?

758
00:52:13.170 --> 00:52:14.830
Are you saying
what I'm thinking?

759
00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:16.230
What are you thinking
I'm saying?

760
00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:18.600
I'm thinking that you're saying that
we shoot a dose of milliamps

761
00:52:18.610 --> 00:52:20.540
straight into the groundwater
and create some kind of...

762
00:52:20.550 --> 00:52:23.610
- Underground electrical fence.
- Exactly.

763
00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:26.610
That's exactly what I'm saying
you're thinking. Can you do it?

764
00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:27.910
I've done more with less.

765
00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:30.350
Yeah, but if
it doesn't work, we die.

766
00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:34.220
So what the hell, Burt?
Have you ever nailed Jell-O to a wall?

767
00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:35.580
I'm not sure
how that's relevant.

768
00:52:35.590 --> 00:52:38.050
It's relevant
because I did it.

769
00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:40.260
And guess what? It stuck.

770
00:52:40.270 --> 00:52:42.560
You know why?
Because everyone said I couldn't.

771
00:52:42.570 --> 00:52:44.900
All right, I got it.
I got it!

772
00:52:45.340 --> 00:52:48.530
And we've got a plan.
We're off to the hangar.

773
00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:51.030
Teams of two.
Travis, you, and Dr. Sims.

774
00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:53.070
Swackhamer, you're with me.

775
00:52:53.650 --> 00:52:56.380
Wingman, we're gonna need
a diversion!

776
00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:58.000
I'm on it.

777
00:52:58.350 --> 00:53:00.340
I'm gonna pretend
I didn't just hear you leave me out

778
00:53:00.350 --> 00:53:02.620
because I'm coming
on this worm hunt.

779
00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:06.820
Elk hunter, huh?
Think you can bang on this short arm?

780
00:53:06.830 --> 00:53:10.450
Piece of cake. You zero that scope
for distance or dangerous game?

781
00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:12.760
- What do you think?
- Stupid question.

782
00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:15.730
Mind if I tweak it for
my preferred point of impact?

783
00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:21.300
Dad and I always zeroed our scopes
at 2.5 inches high at 100 yards.

784
00:53:21.570 --> 00:53:23.270
Well, whatever floats your boat.

785
00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:25.800
You're on overwatch.
Take Vargas and go on the roof.

786
00:53:25.810 --> 00:53:26.970
Roger that.

787
00:53:26.980 --> 00:53:29.740
And hold on tight, huh?
She'll kick some!

788
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:31.240
Got you.

789
00:53:31.950 --> 00:53:34.040
The gun or Vargas?

790
00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:39.650
You feel up for this, old man?

791
00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:41.280
I'm fine.

792
00:53:41.290 --> 00:53:42.820
You make ready.

793
00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.120
Okay, you ready, Dr. Sims?

794
00:53:45.260 --> 00:53:49.130
Oh, shit.
Look what the cat dragged in.

795
00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:51.690
- Oh, good. You're here.
- Mr. Cutts.

796
00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:54.860
I just lost my top scientist
at the Meltwater Hot Springs.

797
00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:58.030
You just got in over your head
and had to punt, huh?

798
00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:00.440
Your experiment's run amok.

799
00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:01.700
My experiment?

800
00:54:01.710 --> 00:54:04.970
What, you think I'm actually
controlling these...

801
00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:08.810
Yeah, but of course you would.
Your psych eval suggested as much.

802
00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:10.250
You had me profiled?

803
00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:14.150
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but this is not the Island of Dr. Moreau.

804
00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:17.290
I'm not some kind of walking
ethical dumpster fire.

805
00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:19.520
My mission here
is more elevated than that.

806
00:54:19.530 --> 00:54:24.060
Oh, yes. No DARPA skunk
works in the hopper, huh?

807
00:54:24.070 --> 00:54:29.430
No bio-engineering perhaps?
A little Graboid gene-splicing?

808
00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:32.880
You know, that's a good idea,
but bio-weapons are not my thing.

809
00:54:33.150 --> 00:54:34.840
I'm here with an engineering team

810
00:54:34.850 --> 00:54:36.870
to assess the purity
of the groundwater

811
00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:40.540
and to design an aquifer to move it out
of the Arctic and into civilization.

812
00:54:40.550 --> 00:54:42.180
This is about water?

813
00:54:42.190 --> 00:54:44.250
Water is the new oil,
and, as you may have noticed,

814
00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:46.620
the Arctic has it
in abundance now.

815
00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:48.480
It took just
one of those creatures

816
00:54:48.490 --> 00:54:50.990
less than a minute to kill
my best scientist.

817
00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:56.330
Nobody move! Nobody move.

818
00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:00.030
It's under the floor.

819
00:55:00.370 --> 00:55:01.960
Don't move.

820
00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:06.340
Shh!

821
00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:09.070
Let me unload.

822
00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:10.770
All right.

823
00:55:11.250 --> 00:55:13.010
Fire at will!

824
00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:18.710
Yes!

825
00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:49.180
Help! Help me!

826
00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:50.580
Here!

827
00:55:50.590 --> 00:55:51.980
Help me! Help me!

828
00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:02.720
All right. Let's scoot
and shoot!

829
00:56:02.730 --> 00:56:03.890
What about us?

830
00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:06.600
Find high ground,
solid ground,

831
00:56:06.740 --> 00:56:09.570
and whatever you do,
don't move!

832
00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:16.540
North Star One
to North Star Hangar.

833
00:56:16.550 --> 00:56:18.520
<i>We are coming your way. Over.</i>

834
00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:20.880
Roger that, Mr. Gummer.

835
00:56:20.890 --> 00:56:22.910
Sounds like
you stepped in it up there.

836
00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:25.690
Affirmative. Time to dig in,
work together. Over.

837
00:56:26.990 --> 00:56:28.280
Is it a hunting party?

838
00:56:28.290 --> 00:56:30.320
Sure as hell
ain't no pony show!

839
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:35.090
All right, look,
I'm gonna lead it away from here.

840
00:56:35.330 --> 00:56:37.700
When I do, run!

841
00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:52.540
Yeah!

842
00:56:52.850 --> 00:56:54.940
Like a dog to a bone!

843
00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:57.980
Bio-mechanics are so sexy!

844
00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:33.020
To the hangar!

845
00:57:33.130 --> 00:57:34.650
Come on!

846
00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:46.030
Incoming! Three o'clock!

847
00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:48.940
Oh, shit! Not another one!

848
00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:52.870
The truck!

849
00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:55.070
- Swackhamer, get up!
- Yeah.

850
00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:05.520
Come on! In the truck!

851
00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:07.050
Come on!

852
00:58:13.830 --> 00:58:15.760
That thing's got me
by the pants!

853
00:58:15.770 --> 00:58:17.290
So take off your pants!

854
00:58:17.300 --> 00:58:19.160
100% no!

855
00:58:19.170 --> 00:58:21.300
- Take off your pants, Rita!
- No!

856
00:58:21.310 --> 00:58:23.730
- Take them off now, goddammit!
- No!

857
00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:26.140
- Why?
- I'm not wearing any underwear!

858
00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:46.090
You're going commando
in the Arctic?

859
00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:47.620
I don't wear underwear.

860
00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:49.530
It's too restricting.

861
00:58:49.770 --> 00:58:51.790
- I think I love!
- Yeah?

862
00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:02.400
- Hey, Hart?
- Yeah?

863
00:59:02.410 --> 00:59:04.910
How many of those
energy drinks did you have today?

864
00:59:08.690 --> 00:59:10.480
Six, maybe seven.

865
00:59:10.490 --> 00:59:12.290
I mean, could be eight.

866
00:59:12.890 --> 00:59:14.580
Get ready to run, Wingman.

867
00:59:14.590 --> 00:59:18.620
We're executing
Diversion Tactic Two.

868
00:59:19.530 --> 00:59:22.260
Okay, Hart. Time to take one
for the team.

869
00:59:22.270 --> 00:59:25.570
Free Willy
and let the big dog eat.

870
00:59:29.980 --> 00:59:31.970
Seriously?
You want me to drop trou?

871
00:59:31.980 --> 00:59:33.470
Don't question my orders!

872
00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:36.470
Now, you take out that disco stick,
and let it dance!

873
00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:38.840
Okay. Don't anybody look.

874
00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:43.810
Dude! We have bigger worms
to worry about!

875
00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:45.980
Get ready to redeploy!

876
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:52.690
That boy's got game!

877
00:59:53.170 --> 00:59:54.760
Fire at will!

878
01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:06.400
- Preferably today!
- I'm trying!

879
01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:13.980
Oh, come on! If you're gonna
piss like a puppy, stay on the porch.

880
01:00:16.590 --> 01:00:19.820
I'm no puppy, Mr. Gummer.
I'll tell you that.

881
01:00:19.830 --> 01:00:22.160
Gonna build me an ark!

882
01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:47.980
We're clear to the hangar.
Go! Go! Go!

883
01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:16.450
Here, here! Take this!

884
01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:31.620
Bad news, Val. Eleven o'clock!

885
01:01:31.630 --> 01:01:33.050
That makes
the Graboid count two.

886
01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:35.790
Yeah, two alive.
One dead.

887
01:02:28.250 --> 01:02:29.810
Burt, you copy? Over?

888
01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:31.690
<i>You there? Copy?</i>

889
01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:32.980
Burt?

890
01:02:32.990 --> 01:02:35.960
Copy, Wingman.

891
01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:38.320
<i>You doing okay?</i>

892
01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:40.520
Why the hell wouldn't I be?

893
01:02:40.530 --> 01:02:42.820
<i>We're fighting
a Graboid apocalypse</i>

894
01:02:42.830 --> 01:02:44.590
<i>with a bunch of noncoms!</i>

895
01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:45.960
Don't worry about me!

896
01:02:45.970 --> 01:02:50.500
Just stick to
the mission objective.

897
01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:04.950
We've got to get
one of those worms pronto!

898
01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:20.800
Watch out!
It's headed your way!

899
01:03:20.810 --> 01:03:23.570
Incoming.
From the drill tower.

900
01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:27.340
<i>Say a prayer, I'm gonna flip
the switch on this ittle cucarcha.</i>

901
01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:31.910
One! Two!

902
01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:34.370
Three!

903
01:03:34.650 --> 01:03:35.880
Shit!

904
01:03:43.130 --> 01:03:44.790
Watch out!

905
01:03:56.210 --> 01:03:59.400
It's working.
It's actually working!

906
01:03:59.410 --> 01:04:01.270
It can't get through.

907
01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:04.140
I told you I've done more
with less!

908
01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:08.350
Come on! Whoo! Yeah!

909
01:04:10.090 --> 01:04:12.180
How're you doing
out there, Burt?

910
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:13.910
<i>Talk to me.</i>

911
01:04:14.930 --> 01:04:16.620
<i>Burt, you're alive?</i>

912
01:04:19.330 --> 01:04:21.720
<i>You've never given up on
anything in your life, old man.</i>

913
01:04:21.730 --> 01:04:24.060
<i>Don't start now!</i>

914
01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:26.700
You father
is very sick, Travis.

915
01:04:26.710 --> 01:04:30.730
He can't die. Not now.
Not on my watch.

916
01:04:30.740 --> 01:04:33.680
This is his second
neuro-muscular collapse.

917
01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:40.010
Come on, Travis.

918
01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:41.640
Man up.

919
01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:44.810
Okay, look, we capture
one of these things, right?

920
01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:46.310
How do we get
what we need?

921
01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:49.720
There should be a glandular sac
somewhere in the throat.

922
01:04:52.430 --> 01:04:55.720
Looks like Sally's testing
our underground electrical fence.

923
01:04:55.730 --> 01:04:57.290
Who's Sally?

924
01:04:57.640 --> 01:04:59.120
You named it?

925
01:04:59.470 --> 01:05:01.400
After an ex.

926
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:04.300
Sally Soulsmasher.

927
01:05:04.310 --> 01:05:06.200
She was a dirty,
man-eating bitch

928
01:05:06.210 --> 01:05:09.310
who used to stick her nose
where it didn't belong.

929
01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:13.110
<i>Everything okay out there?</i>

930
01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:16.480
<i>Copy that, sir.
Just locking the gate. All clear.</i>

931
01:05:16.490 --> 01:05:19.010
Stop moving, you idiot.

932
01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:33.500
It's coming through the floor!

933
01:05:37.410 --> 01:05:38.900
<i>Wingman?</i>

934
01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:40.570
Wingman, you there?

935
01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:42.770
Burt. How are you feeling?

936
01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:45.650
Fit as a butcher's dog.

937
01:06:09.710 --> 01:06:12.110
I'm coming your way, Wingman!

938
01:06:31.830 --> 01:06:33.990
Let's go, guys. Let's go.
Let's get to work.

939
01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.660
Swackhamer, start making
those bombs.

940
01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:47.700
- Look, Burt, we...
- Got to destroy these devils!

941
01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:50.770
- No, we have to catch one of these!
- We don't catch. We kill!

942
01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:53.170
- Even if it kills you?
- This is not about me.

943
01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:56.850
- Yes, it is!
- Not if we still got Graboids out there.

944
01:06:56.860 --> 01:06:58.410
Come on, Burt.
I'm just getting to know you.

945
01:06:58.420 --> 01:07:00.080
I don't wanna see
your sorry ass die.

946
01:07:00.090 --> 01:07:03.120
I'll be dead when I say I'm dead!

947
01:07:03.130 --> 01:07:04.450
That's not how this works!

948
01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:06.960
Last I checked, you don't give
the orders around here.

949
01:07:06.970 --> 01:07:08.760
Oh, I do now.

950
01:07:08.970 --> 01:07:11.190
You never answered
my question.

951
01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:13.800
Where'd you get that HK91?

952
01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:17.000
Heather.

953
01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:19.100
My wife.

954
01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:21.300
Ex-wife, Burt.

955
01:07:21.310 --> 01:07:23.640
Who gave you the right
to meddle in my affairs?

956
01:07:23.650 --> 01:07:26.240
Hey! I'm the result of one of
your affairs, remember?

957
01:07:26.250 --> 01:07:28.680
Bullshit! Bullshit!

958
01:07:28.690 --> 01:07:31.950
You're not hooking and reeling me
into this conversation!

959
01:07:34.430 --> 01:07:36.830
I guess I touched
his thermostat.

960
01:07:37.930 --> 01:07:41.730
You wanna die? Huh?
Do you?

961
01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:44.630
Stop being so stubborn.

962
01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:46.130
Damn!

963
01:07:53.010 --> 01:07:54.570
Did you...

964
01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:58.210
Did you say hooking
and reeling?

965
01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:01.180
Jesus, Burt, you are a genius.

966
01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:04.810
Hey, Mac, how are we doing
on that plane?

967
01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:08.150
Well, I've got to put a wrench
to a few more screws.

968
01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:09.890
Everybody, listen up.

969
01:08:10.530 --> 01:08:13.250
I think I've got a way we can
catch one of these things!

970
01:08:15.830 --> 01:08:17.630
What the hell is that?

971
01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:25.700
The seismic alarm.

972
01:08:28.650 --> 01:08:31.980
We set the core sample
drilling on auto for today, remember?

973
01:08:41.230 --> 01:08:44.750
That damn drilling tower
is like Graboid catnip.

974
01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:47.420
That puss has already
taken the bait.

975
01:08:54.610 --> 01:08:57.930
We've got to shut it down
before Hart becomes a Happy Meal!

976
01:08:57.940 --> 01:09:00.300
The timer panel's attached
to the drill tower.

977
01:09:00.310 --> 01:09:03.970
Okay, if we can't turn it off, we've got
to lead that Graboid away from Hart.

978
01:09:05.050 --> 01:09:06.870
I've got to shut off the drill rig.

979
01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:08.310
You can't go down there, Val.

980
01:09:24.570 --> 01:09:27.540
Battle stations!
Let's make some noise!

981
01:09:27.541 --> 01:09:31.410
Double the voltage this time.
I want him dead!

982
01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:34.300
Hold on, Hart.
I'm coming!

983
01:09:35.950 --> 01:09:38.710
Hurry up, Val.
Number two's coming right at you.

984
01:09:40.950 --> 01:09:45.220
Go! Go! Go! Raise Cain!

985
01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:04.270
Come to papa!

986
01:10:21.430 --> 01:10:23.690
Swackhamer!

987
01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:25.390
Yeah!

988
01:10:43.450 --> 01:10:46.380
That'll close the carpool lane!

989
01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:48.140
Give me some! Whoo!

990
01:10:48.150 --> 01:10:49.480
Give me some, Burt!

991
01:10:49.490 --> 01:10:50.610
Whoo!

992
01:10:50.620 --> 01:10:55.580
Broke into the wrong goddamn hangar,
didn't you, you bastard?

993
01:11:01.030 --> 01:11:02.820
Val, it's in front of you!

994
01:11:14.910 --> 01:11:16.970
Let's go, Hart.
It's retreating!

995
01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:19.470
Jump!

996
01:11:19.550 --> 01:11:21.140
Come on!

997
01:11:22.350 --> 01:11:24.480
All right, let's not celebrate
in a huddle, folks.

998
01:11:24.490 --> 01:11:27.450
We've still got at least
one Graboid out there.

999
01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:34.790
Uh, guys,

1000
01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:38.230
I hate to drop a turd in the punch bowl,
but the genny's blown!

1001
01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:40.670
What the hell does that mean?

1002
01:11:41.410 --> 01:11:45.140
No underground electrical fence.

1003
01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:57.740
We've got to get him to medical.

1004
01:12:01.290 --> 01:12:04.720
Okay. Get that airplane ready to fly,
and wait for my call.

1005
01:12:04.730 --> 01:12:07.820
All right, everybody,
I'm on the point.

1006
01:12:07.830 --> 01:12:10.100
Single file.
Okay.

1007
01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:16.930
Any movement?

1008
01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:19.130
Nothing. Zip.

1009
01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:20.840
<i>- Zilch.
- Nada mucho.</i>

1010
01:12:20.850 --> 01:12:22.900
- I say we run, get there fast.
- Yeah.

1011
01:12:22.910 --> 01:12:26.070
If that thing attacks,
I'll just honey badger the shit out of it.

1012
01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:28.310
Uh, help? Over here!

1013
01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:32.610
Oh, shit, he lived?
I've got to do the right thing, don't I?

1014
01:12:32.620 --> 01:12:34.520
It's a good habit to start.

1015
01:12:34.530 --> 01:12:38.690
Okay, Rita, you take
Aklark and Burt to the medical.

1016
01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:40.390
I don't care what
you have to do to keep him alive!

1017
01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:41.960
Swackhamer, you're with me.

1018
01:12:41.970 --> 01:12:46.600
On three, we break.
One, two, three, break!

1019
01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:57.000
Man, am I glad to see you guys now!
Get me down from here.

1020
01:12:57.010 --> 01:12:58.340
Jump, you chicken-shit!

1021
01:12:58.350 --> 01:13:01.240
No,no,no.
Don't jump, okay?

1022
01:13:01.250 --> 01:13:03.010
But I'll tell you what you can do.

1023
01:13:03.020 --> 01:13:06.750
Remove all the tax liens
on Mr. Gummer for the last 27 years

1024
01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:08.280
and give him back his house,

1025
01:13:08.290 --> 01:13:10.450
and I'll make sure that you stay
on this side of the tundra.

1026
01:13:10.460 --> 01:13:11.620
Yeah, whatever. Done.

1027
01:13:11.630 --> 01:13:13.620
Uh, no, we're not done.

1028
01:13:13.630 --> 01:13:17.860
We also don't wanna pay taxes
for the rest of our life.

1029
01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:20.930
Federal or state, yeah.
Nevada doesn't have state taxes.

1030
01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:23.300
Yeah, no federal taxes!

1031
01:13:23.310 --> 01:13:25.370
Well, that's gonna be
a hard one to swing.

1032
01:13:25.380 --> 01:13:28.640
Uh, have a nice life!
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, fine.

1033
01:13:28.650 --> 01:13:30.670
- I'll do it.
- You didn't see the ladder, asshole?

1034
01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:33.410
Dude! Baby bag.

1035
01:13:38.590 --> 01:13:41.120
Hey, candy-ass!
If you have a set of balls,

1036
01:13:41.130 --> 01:13:42.850
now would be the time
to use them.

1037
01:13:42.860 --> 01:13:44.350
Yeah.

1038
01:13:58.340 --> 01:14:01.400
There she blows.
Time for some psy ops.

1039
01:14:01.410 --> 01:14:05.010
I'm gonna distract Sally Soulsmasher
with some shock and awe!

1040
01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:07.510
Good luck with that.

1041
01:14:14.990 --> 01:14:17.460
Suck on this, worm!

1042
01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.230
Come on!

1043
01:14:27.910 --> 01:14:29.930
Whoo!

1044
01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:32.340
Yeah!

1045
01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:34.170
Yeah!

1046
01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:36.600
Ride them, cowboy!

1047
01:14:44.090 --> 01:14:46.450
Giddyup! Oh, yeah!

1048
01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:48.120
How do you like me now?

1049
01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:02.000
Oh, good. Get me out of here.

1050
01:15:02.010 --> 01:15:04.430
- Take it easy, Burt.
- Don't tell me to take it easy.

1051
01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:05.730
It's time for a sit rep.

1052
01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:07.470
Yeah, I think you better sit
this rep out.

1053
01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:09.400
- Who put you in charge?
- You did.

1054
01:15:09.410 --> 01:15:11.410
- I did?
- Yeah, once you got hurt, Burt.

1055
01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:13.440
That puts me in charge
whether you like it or not.

1056
01:15:13.450 --> 01:15:15.890
I feel fine.

1057
01:15:17.090 --> 01:15:19.450
Tell everybody to gear up
and get ready.

1058
01:15:21.890 --> 01:15:23.280
Get ready for what?

1059
01:15:23.290 --> 01:15:25.450
Ready to save your ass,
that's what!

1060
01:15:25.460 --> 01:15:28.260
Capturing a Graboid! Right?

1061
01:15:28.430 --> 01:15:30.860
You might as well try taking
the black off a crow.

1062
01:15:30.870 --> 01:15:34.900
Hell, while you're at it,
why don't you tell the rain not to dry?

1063
01:15:34.910 --> 01:15:36.200
I'm your only shot.

1064
01:15:36.210 --> 01:15:38.500
- You?
- Yeah, me, Burt! Me!

1065
01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:40.900
Your job is to preserve
my legacy!

1066
01:15:40.910 --> 01:15:44.440
My job is to make a last stand
against these Arctic Graboids.

1067
01:15:44.450 --> 01:15:47.580
You can't stand,
Colonel Custer!

1068
01:15:48.890 --> 01:15:51.450
- Back off!
- It doesn't belong to you!

1069
01:15:51.790 --> 01:15:54.120
Cold, dead hands,
is that it, Burt?

1070
01:15:56.930 --> 01:15:58.950
What is wrong with you?

1071
01:16:00.670 --> 01:16:03.890
I'm trying to save your bacon here,
you stubborn old coot.

1072
01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:05.660
You've crossed the line!

1073
01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:08.360
This fight is done with you.

1074
01:16:08.370 --> 01:16:10.460
Yeah, well, I'm not done
with it!

1075
01:16:10.710 --> 01:16:11.930
Yeah, you are.

1076
01:16:15.650 --> 01:16:17.640
Don't leave me unarmed.

1077
01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:31.450
There.

1078
01:16:32.030 --> 01:16:34.190
You got your true love back.

1079
01:16:35.570 --> 01:16:38.500
I guess blood ain't thicker
than ammo, is it, Burt?

1080
01:16:50.310 --> 01:16:51.800
Yeah.

1081
01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:18.440
If you've got Ass Blasters,
you have Graboids.

1082
01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:20.300
That's right, soldier.

1083
01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:23.540
This is FOB. DOA.

1084
01:17:23.850 --> 01:17:24.910
TMZ.

1085
01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:28.820
My balls are in
the Guinness Book of Balls!

1086
01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:40.990
That went well!

1087
01:17:41.630 --> 01:17:44.070
Yeah, it sounded like it.

1088
01:17:44.970 --> 01:17:46.560
You ready?

1089
01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:51.270
It's a good look for you.

1090
01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:00.680
I guess the big boy's still out there
sleeping somewhere.

1091
01:18:02.220 --> 01:18:04.210
I hope he's the only one.

1092
01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:07.490
When you get pushed in,
you've got to swim, right?

1093
01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:20.100
Hey, Swackhamer, sit rep?

1094
01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:22.090
Seconds away!

1095
01:18:22.370 --> 01:18:25.830
Travis, this plan, it's

1096
01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:27.900
<i>fricking crazy, huh?</i>

1097
01:18:27.910 --> 01:18:30.470
Just like nailing Jell-O
to a wall.

1098
01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:31.940
Yeah, bro.

1099
01:18:31.950 --> 01:18:35.780
This is Mac. I'm wheels up
in five!

1100
01:18:36.090 --> 01:18:38.310
Takes me back
to my banner-tow days.

1101
01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:40.850
<i>Hope the old girl
can handle the load.</i>

1102
01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:44.150
Don't worry. Come on.
It's just a pure catch-and-release mission!

1103
01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:46.290
When the fish is on,
you want me

1104
01:18:46.300 --> 01:18:48.960
<i>to pull up hard and do
a wingover, eh?</i>

1105
01:18:48.970 --> 01:18:53.300
Affirmative. We're gonna use
the bitch's momentum to land her.

1106
01:18:55.270 --> 01:18:58.670
Okay, Aklark, she's all yours.

1107
01:18:58.810 --> 01:19:02.110
Just keep it steady.
We don't wanna wake the beast up.

1108
01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:14.880
Dude!

1109
01:19:14.890 --> 01:19:16.620
Shh!

1110
01:19:37.450 --> 01:19:39.350
Let's go fishing.

1111
01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:06.670
All right, Valerie, you ready
to take down one of these bad boys?

1112
01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:08.170
I'm so ready.

1113
01:20:12.380 --> 01:20:13.870
All right!

1114
01:20:14.220 --> 01:20:17.150
When I get in position,
rock the cradle.

1115
01:20:20.190 --> 01:20:22.060
I'm baiting the hook.

1116
01:20:23.390 --> 01:20:26.620
Okay, Val, get ready.
It's awake.

1117
01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:36.330
Three hundred meters
and closing!

1118
01:20:54.990 --> 01:20:57.790
- One hundred meters and closing.
- Okay, let's go.

1119
01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:01.590
All right, Mac, bring her in.
Bring her in.

1120
01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:31.480
Oh, shit.

1121
01:21:42.470 --> 01:21:43.930
Hooked!

1122
01:21:57.520 --> 01:21:59.750
Oh, shit!

1123
01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:02.090
Release! Release!

1124
01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:25.850
What now?

1125
01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:29.610
Halle-freaking-lujah!

1126
01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:45.430
All right, listen, listen.
Absolutely no guns, okay?

1127
01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:47.690
We don't wanna kill it.
We want it alive.

1128
01:22:47.700 --> 01:22:49.730
We're going old-school
on this thing.

1129
01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:53.540
Shirts versus skins, all right?

1130
01:22:56.610 --> 01:22:59.170
- A three iron?
- It was the best I could do.

1131
01:23:00.220 --> 01:23:02.010
All right.

1132
01:23:03.550 --> 01:23:05.680
Let's go Alpha on this worm!

1133
01:23:15.630 --> 01:23:17.060
Okay.

1134
01:23:17.070 --> 01:23:18.560
All right.

1135
01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:23.870
Whoa, whoa.

1136
01:23:25.580 --> 01:23:27.070
Come on.

1137
01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:30.240
Get him! Come on, kid!
Get him!

1138
01:23:30.250 --> 01:23:31.740
Oh, man!

1139
01:23:32.420 --> 01:23:35.180
Guys, good effort.

1140
01:23:35.190 --> 01:23:37.310
Uh, Swackhamer, you got this.

1141
01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:39.280
- Come on, Swackhamer.
- Whoo! Okay.

1142
01:23:39.290 --> 01:23:41.880
- You got it, man.
- You got it!

1143
01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:03.550
Back off!
Throw it!

1144
01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:09.450
Tap in. Tap in, big man.

1145
01:24:11.290 --> 01:24:15.120
Go get it, Aklark!
It's all yours!

1146
01:24:16.130 --> 01:24:17.620
Don't be afraid.

1147
01:24:17.630 --> 01:24:19.320
It can smell your fear!

1148
01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:22.030
- Make him sushi!
- Come on!

1149
01:24:27.340 --> 01:24:28.460
Yeah!

1150
01:24:36.150 --> 01:24:37.300
Amateurs!

1151
01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:42.280
Wow! I did not
need to see that!

1152
01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:10.640
What's good for the Graboid
is good for the Gummer.

1153
01:25:10.810 --> 01:25:12.300
All right.

1154
01:25:19.390 --> 01:25:21.250
Ugh!

1155
01:25:24.460 --> 01:25:26.220
That can't
be comfortable.

1156
01:25:28.900 --> 01:25:32.690
You went poking around
in my throat with a big-ass needle,

1157
01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:34.690
I'd be pissed!

1158
01:25:36.210 --> 01:25:38.830
Dude, you need a Tic Tac.

1159
01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:44.240
That is so awkward.

1160
01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:55.320
Oh, it smells so bad.

1161
01:25:55.330 --> 01:25:57.850
They should call him
Deep Throat.

1162
01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:05.130
That is all kinds of nasty.

1163
01:26:10.540 --> 01:26:14.130
At least the gland
wasn't in the prostate!

1164
01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:15.730
Yeah.

1165
01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:53.110
I'm sorry, Travis.

1166
01:26:54.020 --> 01:26:55.510
That's it?

1167
01:26:56.950 --> 01:26:59.440
There has to be
something more you can do.

1168
01:27:34.260 --> 01:27:39.490
That is no way
to treat an HK91!

1169
01:27:48.540 --> 01:27:50.340
Sorry, Burt.

1170
01:27:51.210 --> 01:27:52.800
It won't happen again.

1171
01:28:03.430 --> 01:28:05.000
Oh.

1172
01:28:21.570 --> 01:28:26.070
With all due respect, soldier,
you need a shower.

1173
01:28:28.710 --> 01:28:31.080
What's the damn fuss?

1174
01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:34.040
How do you not die?
You never die.

1175
01:28:41.830 --> 01:28:44.020
- Mr. Gummer.
- Sir.

1176
01:28:44.030 --> 01:28:45.950
Glad to see you
up and at them.

1177
01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:48.860
Now, it gives me
great pleasure to present you

1178
01:28:48.870 --> 01:28:52.830
with your permanent
federal tax lien release, in perpetuity,

1179
01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:55.300
as well as the title deeds
to your property.

1180
01:28:55.310 --> 01:28:57.700
Signed, sealed...

1181
01:28:57.710 --> 01:28:59.400
And delivered.

1182
01:29:07.580 --> 01:29:10.280
- You're too kind.
- You're right.

1183
01:29:10.290 --> 01:29:14.280
This species will make
an exceptional bio-weapon.

1184
01:29:14.290 --> 01:29:17.580
When it comes to Graboids,
I'm rarely wrong, Mr. Cutts.

1185
01:29:17.590 --> 01:29:20.590
Mmm-hmm.
With the right neuro-implant,

1186
01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:23.760
it could be a bunker-buster
for God and country.

1187
01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.390
What do you think?

1188
01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:26.990
I was right about you all along.

1189
01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:31.700
You and your DARPA minions,
you're a bunch of malevolent ineptoids!

1190
01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:36.810
What the hell was that,
Mr. Gummer?

1191
01:29:38.820 --> 01:29:41.280
That, sir, is the trigger.

1192
01:29:41.350 --> 01:29:44.440
And I am the finger.

1193
01:29:44.450 --> 01:29:46.580
Look, I don't know
what you're doing,

1194
01:29:46.590 --> 01:29:49.950
but I'd strongly
advise you not to do it!

1195
01:29:49.960 --> 01:29:51.930
Oh?

1196
01:29:53.300 --> 01:29:55.720
That Graboid is
US government property!

1197
01:29:55.730 --> 01:29:57.930
Hate to be a buzzkill.

1198
01:29:57.970 --> 01:29:59.630
Shoot it.
Blow it out of the sky!

1199
01:30:09.150 --> 01:30:10.700
Yes!

1200
01:30:16.850 --> 01:30:20.380
Graboids don't make
good pets, Mr. Cutts.

1201
01:30:20.390 --> 01:30:21.650
Preach on it, Burt!

1202
01:30:21.660 --> 01:30:24.490
Yeah!

1203
01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:26.350
Yeah!

1204
01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:30.690
Mr. Gummer,
my plane's all packed and ready to go.

1205
01:30:30.700 --> 01:30:33.500
- Roger that.
- By the way,

1206
01:30:33.540 --> 01:30:35.030
Nice work.

1207
01:30:36.510 --> 01:30:39.000
Dad was right.
You are a hard-ass!

1208
01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:41.700
Tell your dad I said, "Hey".

1209
01:30:41.710 --> 01:30:44.080
Tell him not to drop in.

1210
01:30:44.150 --> 01:30:45.810
He's not really
the dropping-in kind of guy.

1211
01:30:45.820 --> 01:30:48.180
He's more of
the barging-in type.

1212
01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:51.180
This is gonna be one hell
of a story to tell back home.

1213
01:30:51.190 --> 01:30:54.660
Tell him I said you're a better shot
than he ever was.

1214
01:30:54.790 --> 01:30:56.520
Thanks, Mr. Gummer.

1215
01:30:57.730 --> 01:30:59.660
Call me Burt!

1216
01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:07.090
You know I won't be
in the Arctic Circle forever, right?

1217
01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:10.770
Six months,
I'll be back in the States.

1218
01:31:11.370 --> 01:31:13.400
You trying to get sweet
with me?

1219
01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:15.300
Definitely.

1220
01:31:15.710 --> 01:31:17.300
Never gonna happen.

1221
01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:20.240
I think it might.

1222
01:31:24.050 --> 01:31:25.650
Thanks.

1223
01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:28.050
For everything.

1224
01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:45.070
Travis, what have you learned
from me?

1225
01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:47.900
Uh, to not trust anyone
or anything ever?

1226
01:31:47.910 --> 01:31:50.240
You call that a goodbye kiss?

1227
01:31:50.250 --> 01:31:55.580
A man brings a big bore .44 Magnum
to a fight, not some broke dick .22.

1228
01:31:55.590 --> 01:31:57.310
Broke dick?
That was sweet dick.

1229
01:31:57.320 --> 01:31:59.050
- Oh, was it?
- Yeah.

1230
01:31:59.060 --> 01:32:03.220
'Cause that sorely lacked any kind
of velocity or stopping power,

1231
01:32:03.230 --> 01:32:06.120
not to mention
maximum penetration.

1232
01:32:06.130 --> 01:32:07.390
Okay, it's a little late to have

1233
01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:10.260
the guns-and-ammo
talk, Burt. All right?

1234
01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:13.590
Pathetic.

1235
01:32:57.080 --> 01:32:59.010
- It was better.
- Better?

1236
01:32:59.020 --> 01:33:03.340
It was no .44 Magnum.
.357, maybe.

1237
01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:04.710
Dude, what do you know
about kissing?

1238
01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:08.590
I know enough not to unholster
my weapon unless I'm prepared to use it.

1239
01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:11.320
It's nice to see you back
to your old self, Burt.

1240
01:33:11.330 --> 01:33:15.020
What do you say we get on home
and get ourselves some real sunshine, huh?

1241
01:33:16.670 --> 01:33:19.160
Sounds like perfection, Pops.

1242
01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:28.240
Pops.
