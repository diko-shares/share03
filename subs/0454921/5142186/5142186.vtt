2
00:01:11.012 --> 00:01:15.192
Just before Christmas, I witnessed  something extraordinary. I stood in

3
00:01:15.232 --> 00:01:20.348
a room with two robots that were  starting to do something distinctly

4
00:01:20.388 --> 00:01:27.020
human. They were learning like  young children do, when they

5
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.784
discover the world for the first  time. They were developing a

6
00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:36.364
language, one that I didn't  understand. It's quite scary. Oh,

7
00:01:36.404 --> 00:01:46.364
gosh, it's asked me to do something.  More and more of the things we once

8
00:01:47.764 --> 00:01:53.380
thought made us human are now being  taken on by machines. I want to

9
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.536
find out how close we are to  creating artificial intelligence.

10
00:01:59.576 --> 00:02:05.116
And what that might mean for us as  human. As a mathtition, should I be

11
00:02:05.156 --> 00:02:10.176
worried that they may put me out of  a job, or could they extend human

12
00:02:10.216 --> 00:02:20.176
intelligence in unimaginable new  ways? What are these machines? Or,

13
00:02:42.032 --> 00:02:48.524
In February 2011, New York was a  seen for a very public test of how

14
00:02:48.564 --> 00:02:55.992
clever machines have become. A  showdown watched by millions, took

15
00:02:56.032 --> 00:02:59.240
place between two men and a  supercomputer. The arena for this

16
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.536
battle was a quiz show called  Jeopardy. It's one of the most

17
00:03:04.576 --> 00:03:14.536
popular and long-running quiz shows  in America. It's famous for its

18
00:03:19.688 --> 00:03:27.896
Fortunately, those in mankind's  corner had no problem with these

19
00:03:27.936 --> 00:03:34.928
questions. One of the two human  contestants was Brad Rutter, the

20
00:03:34.968 --> 00:03:41.960
show's biggest-ever money winner.  He became a five-time champion,

21
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.868
earning a record $3.2 million.  long as I can remember, I grew up

22
00:03:45.908 --> 00:03:48.804
with Jeopardy and by the time I was  in high school I started realising

23
00:03:48.844 --> 00:03:52.568
I knew the answers to most  questions and if I ever get a

24
00:03:52.608 --> 00:03:58.960
chance to try out, I think I can do  pretty well. If wow have told me

25
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:08.432
how well I would actually do I  would have said you were crazy, but

26
00:04:08.472 --> 00:04:11.712
$3.2 million later here I am.  the newcomer. This is Watson.

27
00:04:11.752 --> 00:04:20.152
Watson was one of the most  sophisticated AI computers ever

28
00:04:20.192 --> 00:04:23.132
built. Sitting in the audience was  his creator. We wanted to do this

29
00:04:23.172 --> 00:04:28.772
kind of experiment, this  illustration of what would it take

30
00:04:28.812 --> 00:04:34.588
for a computer to play Jeopardy  against a human. A brain that fits

31
00:04:34.628 --> 00:04:38.320
in a shoebox powered on a glass of  water and sandwich then you have a

32
00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.540
computer 80 kilowatts of  electricity and 20 tonnes of air

33
00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:51.104
conditioning. This is what it took.  In the lead-up to the match, Watson

34
00:04:51.144 --> 00:04:56.588
had to learn how to play the game.  In effect, it had to be coached.

35
00:04:56.628 --> 00:04:59.728
One of the most difficult tasks it  faced was to get to grips with the

36
00:04:59.768 --> 00:05:09.728
cryptic format of the game, where  the contestants are first given the

37
00:05:11.584 --> 00:05:16.436
answer and have to come up with the  question. This queen fled to London.

38
00:05:16.476 --> 00:05:23.232
It had to go through the 200  million pages of information it had

39
00:05:23.272 --> 00:05:30.336
been programmed with and find the  answer in just three seconds.

40
00:05:30.376 --> 00:05:39.744
famous clown or any incompetent  fool? Who is Bozzo. After four

41
00:05:39.784 --> 00:05:46.948
years of development, Watson was  considered ready for the challenge.

42
00:05:46.988 --> 00:05:52.744
Let's play Jeopardy. Here we go.  was a really, really tense moment.

43
00:05:52.784 --> 00:05:57.056
If I was going to fail we were  going to fail in front of - This

44
00:05:57.096 --> 00:06:02.360
was real jeopardy? This is real.  You were putting yourself on the

45
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.368
line. This was real and live.  People are going to route for the

46
00:06:06.408 --> 00:06:13.028
people rather than the machine, so  we felt a little bit of pressure,

47
00:06:13.068 --> 00:06:18.652
but also a great opportunity to  kind of represent humanity against

48
00:06:18.692 --> 00:06:25.668
encroaching technology, shall we  say? Four-letter word for a vantage

49
00:06:25.708 --> 00:06:32.872
point or belief? What is a view.  You have adrenaline going. It was

50
00:06:32.912 --> 00:06:38.932
an open playing field. Anything  could happen. Who can Grendell

51
00:06:38.972 --> 00:06:46.136
is the 1930s? After the first round  of the first game, Watson was tied

52
00:06:46.176 --> 00:06:49.984
with Brad at about $5,000. Into a  tie for the lead. I think everyone

53
00:06:50.024 --> 00:06:55.404
sat there and thought at least we  didn't lose. In other words, at

54
00:06:55.444 --> 00:06:58.592
least at this point, the awedients  is understanding -- audience is

55
00:06:58.632 --> 00:07:03.952
understanding that the system is  good to tie a grand champion.

56
00:07:03.992 --> 00:07:08.436
close for comfort. I remember that  moment when I first heard about

57
00:07:08.476 --> 00:07:12.640
Watson. I thought what a key moment  for AI. We have already programmed

58
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:18.840
a computer to beat humans at chess,  but chess is a vertical thought

59
00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:24.124
process, where you are making deep,  logical connections. Watson is

60
00:07:24.164 --> 00:07:27.780
doing something completely  different and thinking horizontally,

61
00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:33.856
accessing a huge database. This is  machine intelligence taken in a new

62
00:07:33.896 --> 00:07:37.672
direction. The computer is starting  to think in a multi-dimensional way.

63
00:07:37.712 --> 00:07:41.780
How the game would unfold was to  change the way many people think

64
00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:46.156
about artificial intelligence,  including me. But in order to

65
00:07:46.196 --> 00:07:56.156
understand the real significance of  Watson, I need to know where this

66
00:08:00.368 --> 00:08:06.248
dream to replicate our intelligence  For thousands of years, we have

67
00:08:06.288 --> 00:08:10.608
invented machines to do things for  us. But there was one moment in

68
00:08:10.648 --> 00:08:20.608
history where we realised they  weren't just slaves, but had the

69
00:08:24.944 --> 00:08:32.656
potential to be our rivals. Or even  I've come to the place where this

70
00:08:32.696 --> 00:08:36.392
realisation first came to life. It  was in this building, that the

71
00:08:36.432 --> 00:08:46.392
search for artificial intelligence  began. What happened here still

72
00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:55.264
resonates today. The idea that  machines could be intelligent like

73
00:08:55.304 --> 00:09:04.452
us was sparked by one man. He was  the brilliant man, Alan Turing and

74
00:09:04.492 --> 00:09:08.676
he's a real hero of mine. When he  was a young man in his 20s he came

75
00:09:08.716 --> 00:09:13.064
to work here at Bletchley Park, as  a code breaker. This was the home

76
00:09:13.104 --> 00:09:18.656
of British intelligence at the time.  It was the 1930s and Britain was

77
00:09:18.696 --> 00:09:24.580
gearing up to war with Germany. As  well as needing the brute force of

78
00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:28.504
the military, the Government were  gathering a crack team hear. And

79
00:09:28.544 --> 00:09:38.504
his genius was precisely what was  needed at this time of national

80
00:09:55.008 --> 00:09:58.988
The main problem that he had to  wrestle with whilst here, was this.

81
00:09:59.028 --> 00:10:02.960
It's an enigma machine and it's an  incredibly clever piece of kit. It

82
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:09.960
was used by the German military to  scramble secret messages into code

83
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.552
that nobody could understand.  Cracking this code was incredibly

84
00:10:13.592 --> 00:10:23.552
difficult for humans. The Germans  believed that the code was

85
00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:31.348
uncrackable. It was up to human  minds to decipher the cryptic

86
00:10:31.388 --> 00:10:34.924
communication that was picked up on  the airwaves. This was an

87
00:10:34.964 --> 00:10:44.424
impossibly long task. We were on  the brink of war and didn't have

88
00:10:44.464 --> 00:10:49.348
time to waist. -- waste. The  machine consists of a key board

89
00:10:49.388 --> 00:10:53.268
that I will type my message on to  try to encode it. If I press an R,

90
00:10:53.308 --> 00:10:58.208
then the wires in the machine go  through and light up a letter at

91
00:10:58.248 --> 00:11:02.252
the top here, so the R was encoded  by theler N, but the incredible

92
00:11:02.292 --> 00:11:07.568
thing is, about the machine, if I  press R again it doesn't get

93
00:11:07.608 --> 00:11:11.004
encoded by N the next time, because  these rotas have kicked on one step

94
00:11:11.044 --> 00:11:17.080
and so the wires are connecting up  the letters in a completely

95
00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:21.332
different way now. So when I now  press R it is F. The operators had

96
00:11:21.372 --> 00:11:26.396
different ways that they could set  up the machine, so they can make a

97
00:11:26.436 --> 00:11:29.660
choice, for example, of which rotas  they were using, so there were five

98
00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:33.632
different rotas and they would  choose three and they could put

99
00:11:33.672 --> 00:11:38.768
them inside in different orders.  Then they would set each of the

100
00:11:38.808 --> 00:11:42.800
rotas on one of 26 different  settings and then not only that,

101
00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:49.552
they had some plugs at the front  here, which would also scramble up

102
00:11:49.592 --> 00:11:53.408
all of the letters, so the combined  effect is that there are over 150

103
00:11:53.448 --> 00:12:03.380
Slobodan Milosevic different ways  that the machine can be -- million,

104
00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:13.380
million, million, different ways  that the machine can be set up. It

105
00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:17.400
really was human against machine.  Alan Turing and his team realised

106
00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:24.304
the human mind wasn't fast enough  to do this and the only hope they

107
00:12:24.344 --> 00:12:28.224
had of cracking the code was to  create another machine to do it.

108
00:12:28.264 --> 00:12:33.804
This is the incredible machine that  he and his colleagues created. It's

109
00:12:33.844 --> 00:12:37.768
called the Bomb. It was from this  mesh of cogs and switches held

110
00:12:37.808 --> 00:12:41.712
together by over ten miles of wire  that finally came the ability to

111
00:12:41.752 --> 00:12:46.176
crack the code on a daily basis.  Something that no human had come

112
00:12:46.216 --> 00:12:49.520
close to being able to do. What  this machine did changed the course

113
00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:59.520
of the war and many regard as  crucial to the allied victory over

114
00:13:03.752 --> 00:13:06.772
In one sense, this machine was just  a collection of cogs and wheels.

115
00:13:06.812 --> 00:13:14.848
But it could do something that some  of the finest finds in Britain

116
00:13:14.888 --> 00:13:24.120
couldn't. It was an unsettling  moment. Was this machine cleverer

117
00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.336
than a human? That is an incredibly  satisfying sound. It must have been

118
00:13:27.376 --> 00:13:30.208
an amazing moment when they  switched it on for the first time,

119
00:13:30.248 --> 00:13:33.664
seeing the cogs clicking through  all the different possibilities,

120
00:13:33.704 --> 00:13:39.088
getting a possible setting in ten  minutes what would have taken

121
00:13:39.128 --> 00:13:44.164
humans weeks to try to find. To see  this machine solve a problem that

122
00:13:44.204 --> 00:13:48.180
many regarded as impossible, it  must have really fired Alan

123
00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:51.884
Turing's imagination. This was  built to crack the enigma code, but

124
00:13:51.924 --> 00:14:01.680
he must have begun to think about  what was the limit of what machines

125
00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:10.244
could do? Once the war was over,  his ideas about machines that could

126
00:14:10.284 --> 00:14:15.384
mimic the human mind really started  to take shape. But it was when he

127
00:14:15.424 --> 00:14:19.916
asked the question, can a machine  think in a paper in 1950, that the

128
00:14:19.956 --> 00:14:25.808
idea finally sparked people's  imaginations. For many, it conjured

129
00:14:25.848 --> 00:14:30.056
up terrifying visions of the future  and sparked furious debate. But it

130
00:14:30.096 --> 00:14:38.884
was this idea, above any other,  than inspired scientists in labs

131
00:14:38.924 --> 00:14:42.560
across the world to try to re-  create what is essentially us. The

132
00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:49.132
hunt for artificial intelligence  has become tied up with one

133
00:14:49.172 --> 00:14:58.464
technology, the computer. At the  heart of it is the simple idea that

134
00:14:58.504 --> 00:15:04.448
humans and computers aren't so very  different. The central thesis of AI

135
00:15:04.488 --> 00:15:08.432
is that actually all human thought  is just computation, that the mind

136
00:15:08.472 --> 00:15:13.324
and the brain are just a  sophisticated sort of machine. So,

137
00:15:13.364 --> 00:15:22.260
if you could make a big enough  computer, with the best software,

138
00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:27.288
you can make a copy of the human  So riveted by the man versus

139
00:15:27.328 --> 00:15:32.464
machine Jeopardy game. Because at  estheart, it was so much more than

140
00:15:32.504 --> 00:15:41.920
just a TV showdown. Hoare was a  machine that could grapple with

141
00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:48.120
natural language, as well as any  human. -- here. Including pun,

142
00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:52.368
riddles and complex questions  across a broad range of knowledge.

143
00:15:52.408 --> 00:15:58.120
Please welcome Watson. At the end  of the first round, the

144
00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:03.696
supercomputer Watson was neck and  neck with human Brad. But as the

145
00:16:03.736 --> 00:16:10.760
second round began, the computer  started to show what it was really

146
00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:16.056
capable of. Watson who is... Frans  list. Who is the church lady. It

147
00:16:16.096 --> 00:16:23.560
all fell apart from Ken and me the  second day. Watson went on a tear.

148
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:30.056
What is violin. It ex exceeded  expectations Watson dominated the

149
00:16:30.096 --> 00:16:37.608
entire thing. The final blow for  human kind was when Watson went on

150
00:16:37.648 --> 00:16:40.700
to win a bonus question. Answer...  Which doubleded his score. When

151
00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:46.264
Watson hit the daily double that  was pretty much the end of the road

152
00:16:46.304 --> 00:16:53.764
ch you could see the look on Ken's  face, we knew, the guys in the team,

153
00:16:53.804 --> 00:16:57.652
that "It was over, we've won."  Watson's landslide victory made

154
00:16:57.692 --> 00:17:02.576
headlines across America. I would  have thought technology like this

155
00:17:02.616 --> 00:17:08.080
was years away but it is here now.  I have the bruised eco-to prove it.

156
00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:12.764
For days after the interhet was  alive with chatter about the demise

157
00:17:12.804 --> 00:17:18.436
of humanity. Here was a computer  that was displaying uniquely human

158
00:17:18.476 --> 00:17:25.468
qualities. This machine could  understand all the complexities,

159
00:17:25.508 --> 00:17:35.468
puns and riddles much faster than  any human. But was this true

160
00:17:36.976 --> 00:17:39.468
artificial intelligence? Was Watson  really thinking like us? The 1980s

161
00:17:39.508 --> 00:17:42.748
the American philosopher John  Searle challenged the idea whether

162
00:17:42.788 --> 00:17:47.312
a machine could ever really think.  He came up with an interesting

163
00:17:47.352 --> 00:17:52.560
thought experiment to try and prove  his idea. It is called the Chinese

164
00:17:52.600 --> 00:18:02.560
Room. I am going to try and put  that into practise to explore his

165
00:18:12.072 --> 00:18:22.032
He imagined a non-Chinese speaking  person like me, in a bare room,

166
00:18:23.276 --> 00:18:26.248
with an instruction manual, and a  selection of Chinese characters. He

167
00:18:26.288 --> 00:18:31.160
then imagined someone who could  speak Chinese, to be outside the

168
00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:41.160
room, communicating with me, by a  series of messages written using

169
00:18:49.448 --> 00:18:56.640
Chinese characters. Can you speak  Chinese? The messages are posted to

170
00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:02.408
me through a door. And I have to  come up with a response, even

171
00:19:02.448 --> 00:19:08.800
though I don't understand a word of  Chinese. OK I haven't got a clue

172
00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:13.316
what this says. But if I follow the  instructions in this book, I should

173
00:19:13.356 --> 00:19:17.880
be able to give some sort of  response to this question, which

174
00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:25.064
will make some sort of sense, so  let's have a look. What do I have

175
00:19:25.104 --> 00:19:30.296
to find? There is a little one over  X symbol. The book tells me to find

176
00:19:30.336 --> 00:19:34.596
an exact match of the message on  the top half of the page. And then

177
00:19:34.636 --> 00:19:39.936
to reply by copying the Chinese  characters from the bottom half of

178
00:19:39.976 --> 00:19:45.520
the page. That is interesting. Some  of the characters appear in the

179
00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:50.580
answer, which makes some sense.  Gosh, I don't know whether these

180
00:19:50.620 --> 00:20:00.580
are the right way round. That looks  like a little house with a roof on

181
00:20:03.136 --> 00:20:08.864
the top. I need this character here.  Oh yes. Bingo! Who knows what I

182
00:20:08.904 --> 00:20:13.096
have just said! Can you speak  Chinese? He compared the person in

183
00:20:13.136 --> 00:20:23.096
the room making up the Chinese  message, to a computer reading a

184
00:20:45.232 --> 00:20:51.284
bit of code. Have you been to  No I haven't been to China but

185
00:20:51.324 --> 00:20:55.396
would one day like to. I am just  faking I can speak Chinese. So just

186
00:20:55.436 --> 00:20:59.784
how convincing was I? You your  Chinese was perfect. If we were on

187
00:20:59.824 --> 00:21:03.004
line having a chat like that, you  would have been convinced you were

188
00:21:03.044 --> 00:21:10.504
talking to... I really really would.  I would have thought you were

189
00:21:10.544 --> 00:21:13.364
someone who spoke Chinese.  Chinese Room I think is an

190
00:21:13.404 --> 00:21:17.080
important thought experiment. Not  for the answers it offers but more

191
00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:20.628
for the questions it raise, because  I certainly didn't understand a

192
00:21:20.668 --> 00:21:26.644
word of what I was writing down  there, yet I seem to be able to

193
00:21:26.684 --> 00:21:31.020
fake the fact I was speaking  Mandarin, so if a computer is

194
00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:36.396
following instructions, isn't  really thinking, is it? But then

195
00:21:36.436 --> 00:21:40.944
again, what is my mind doing when I  am actually articulating words now?

196
00:21:40.984 --> 00:21:45.020
It is following a set of  instructions, so it raises the

197
00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:54.068
question, where is the threshold?  What point can you they a machine

198
00:21:54.108 --> 00:21:58.992
is really understanding and  thinking? So, our bigger and faster

199
00:21:59.032 --> 00:22:03.600
machines going to bring us closer  to this threshold? Since John

200
00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:10.040
Searle came one the Chinese Room  experiment computer power has been

201
00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:16.600
doubling every two years. I am off  to see one of the most powerful

202
00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:22.304
computers that exists in the world  today. We enter the lab I need to

203
00:22:22.344 --> 00:22:27.680
warn you it will be very noisy. You  will need some ear protection.

204
00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:31.224
What is the noise? So that is all  cold air blowing through the racks,

205
00:22:31.264 --> 00:22:34.584
to cool off the computer chip.  Because they are working so hard.

206
00:22:34.624 --> 00:22:42.664
Because they are working so hard.  This is the first time I have done

207
00:22:42.704 --> 00:22:47.520
an interview with ear plugs in.  This beast of a machine called Blue

208
00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:51.972
Gene is a phenomenal piece of  engineering. It is used to perform

209
00:22:52.012 --> 00:22:59.972
the kind of calculations that my  brain could never do, and it never

210
00:23:00.012 --> 00:23:07.944
has to sleep. Fred Mintzer is the  naers inventor and Cray to have

211
00:23:07.984 --> 00:23:13.944
Blue Gene. -- master. So this is  first generation Blue Gene rack.

212
00:23:13.984 --> 00:23:19.960
Its commutational performance is  5.6 Terra nops a second. A teraflop

213
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:26.336
is a million million operations per  second. Faster than I can go.

214
00:23:26.376 --> 00:23:32.820
Faster than you can go. How many  have you got. We have 16 Rab rack,

215
00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:41.616
they all work in parallel. That is  60,000 processors and a performance

216
00:23:41.656 --> 00:23:45.584
of 91 teraflops a second. Blue Gene  is solving complex calculations

217
00:23:45.624 --> 00:23:51.696
about biological processes. It  would take me the rest of my life

218
00:23:51.736 --> 00:23:59.524
to do what this computer can do in  an hour. But is it really being

219
00:23:59.564 --> 00:24:06.164
intelligent? Or is it just doing  what it is told? The real

220
00:24:06.204 --> 00:24:10.976
intelligence comes from the  programmer. It is totally

221
00:24:11.016 --> 00:24:15.772
programmed intelligence. Would you  say it's a big number cruncher.. It

222
00:24:15.812 --> 00:24:20.288
is an enormous number cruncher. But  it the doing the things our brains

223
00:24:20.328 --> 00:24:30.288
could never get anywhere near.  computers are good at computation,

224
00:24:34.709 --> 00:24:37.104
brains do much more. It is  impressive to see just how powerful

225
00:24:37.144 --> 00:24:40.648
they have become. This firepower  you have with Blue Gene is

226
00:24:40.688 --> 00:24:45.480
something my brain could get  nowhere near, but then again, with

227
00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:50.200
when I am doing maths it is not  just doing number crunching. I am

228
00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:54.008
doing more than that. The brain is  working, making leap, a lot of

229
00:24:54.048 --> 00:25:00.308
imagination, there is a lot of  choices involved, which often

230
00:25:00.348 --> 00:25:04.964
involve a kind of aesthetic  sensibility. I am not saying a ma

231
00:25:05.004 --> 00:25:08.868
sheen like that might not be able  do that but at the moment it is a

232
00:25:08.908 --> 00:25:18.260
sheer brute force crunching. It  hasn't captured what my brain can

233
00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:21.544
do. These other qualities that  inare inhe want hernt in how man

234
00:25:21.584 --> 00:25:26.728
intelligence, like creativity and  imagine nation, are what make us so

235
00:25:26.768 --> 00:25:31.088
unique. And they are the reason  that the quest for artificial

236
00:25:31.128 --> 00:25:34.932
intelligence is such an interesting  and difficult challenge. There is

237
00:25:34.972 --> 00:25:40.040
no reason to think that a computer  couldn't one day develop these

238
00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:50.040
qualities too. But to do this,  scientists have got to get o grips

239
00:26:01.644 --> 00:26:07.292
with exactly how well develop them  At the heart of human intelligence

240
00:26:07.332 --> 00:26:14.572
lies ourable to learn to do things  we have never done before. Which is

241
00:26:14.612 --> 00:26:20.964
what has borough me here. And that  is not me by the way. I have joined

242
00:26:21.004 --> 00:26:26.000
the circus an my challenge is to  walk the tightrope. Not something

243
00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:33.496
mathematicians normally do. My  instructor for the day is Lila.

244
00:26:33.536 --> 00:26:39.264
are nervous. It is not that. There  we go. This is a training wire.

245
00:26:39.304 --> 00:26:42.904
So... This isn't the real thing.  is. It is the same you will feel on

246
00:26:42.944 --> 00:26:49.200
the high wire. You don't have the  fear fabg - factor because you can

247
00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:59.200
stand over it safely. The other one  there is a bit of jeopardy. No, it

248
00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:10.640
is just... You could get a body  bubble edouble. He is wearing a red

249
00:27:11.068 --> 00:27:14.404
shirt! See, no movement. So once  upon a time he couldn't do that. He

250
00:27:14.444 --> 00:27:19.952
wasn't born being able do that.  That is something he learned.

251
00:27:19.992 --> 00:27:25.576
I should have the confidence that I  can learn this new skill.. You know

252
00:27:25.616 --> 00:27:33.124
the younger you learn something...  What are you saying? I am saying it

253
00:27:33.164 --> 00:27:41.088
is easier. You saying I am too old.  No, not at all. I am going to do

254
00:27:41.128 --> 00:27:47.828
this. Lila can't programme me with  a set of rules. Unlike a computer,

255
00:27:47.868 --> 00:27:52.280
my brain and my body have to master  this by themselves. As a

256
00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:56.388
mathematician I know there is a  formula to describe what is going

257
00:27:56.428 --> 00:28:06.388
on here. But I can't calculate my  way out of this. I just have to do

258
00:28:13.992 --> 00:28:18.264
Let your muscles do the thinking.  Turn your brain off a bit. I have o

259
00:28:18.304 --> 00:28:23.296
do things with my body and I have  to think and counter act certain

260
00:28:23.336 --> 00:28:33.296
things which I shouldn't do. There  is a guy over there, who can just

261
00:28:38.164 --> 00:28:42.124
sort of skip and dance across.  Hands up. Hands up. Hands up!

262
00:28:42.164 --> 00:28:46.608
trying to concentrate on the wall  over there and keep my hand up, I

263
00:28:46.648 --> 00:28:50.188
am trying to keep this leg straight,  and maybe I am thinking too much.

264
00:28:50.228 --> 00:28:54.440
think, we have to get some of it  into muscle memory so you don't

265
00:28:54.480 --> 00:29:00.140
think about that, that it comes  naturally. As I flail round on the

266
00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:04.468
tightrope, I can see the  complicates physics I am asking my

267
00:29:04.508 --> 00:29:08.656
brain and body do to master this  new skill. It is this idea that the

268
00:29:08.696 --> 00:29:18.656
brain and body work together. That  is taking the hunt for AI in a

269
00:29:31.432 --> 00:29:41.344
I have come to meet a scientist who  has built the world's first

270
00:29:41.384 --> 00:29:47.924
anthropomimetic robot. Which means  it mimics the hue -- human body.

271
00:29:47.964 --> 00:29:51.860
Because he believes that our fiscal  form actually helps shape the way

272
00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:57.832
we think. Without a body,  artificial intelligence cannot

273
00:29:57.872 --> 00:30:01.656
exist. 6. What we are interested in  is how the brain controls body and

274
00:30:01.696 --> 00:30:07.548
having built the body we have  realised what a serious problem

275
00:30:07.588 --> 00:30:15.316
that. Can I interact with it?  you like to shake hands with it?

276
00:30:15.356 --> 00:30:25.316
Yes, provided it doesn't clonking  me anywhere sensitive. Give its

277
00:30:29.872 --> 00:30:33.328
hand a good squeeze and a shake.  It's squeezing back. It's really

278
00:30:33.368 --> 00:30:37.096
responding to contact with me,  picking up something. It gives

279
00:30:37.136 --> 00:30:47.096
people the sensation of interacting  with something that in a way of

280
00:30:47.448 --> 00:30:55.960
really like themselves. This robot  called Ecce Robot has no blood or

281
00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.348
skin or flesh, but ha bones, joints,  muscles and tendons that move like

282
00:31:00.388 --> 00:31:03.940
ours, so it's able to have human  interactions. This is an

283
00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:09.600
extraordinary piece of engineering,  but how does it help in getting

284
00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:14.144
insight into intelligence? We are  interested in what is known as

285
00:31:14.184 --> 00:31:18.268
embodied intelligence. This is the  idea that your intelligence is not

286
00:31:18.308 --> 00:31:22.848
an abstract free intelligence, but  tied very much to having a body and

287
00:31:22.888 --> 00:31:29.816
in particular to having a human  body. In order to investigate this,

288
00:31:29.856 --> 00:31:33.600
what we have to do was build a  robot that had as near to a human

289
00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:37.944
body as we can manage and  investigate the way it interacts

290
00:31:37.984 --> 00:31:41.208
with the world and enables it to  develop a particular sort of

291
00:31:41.248 --> 00:31:48.836
intelligence for dealing with  objects and so on. Once we get on

292
00:31:48.876 --> 00:31:52.912
that track we'll be able to see how  that intelligence, how that is

293
00:31:52.952 --> 00:31:58.288
actually determined and conditioned  by its body. You think it will be

294
00:31:58.328 --> 00:32:04.584
distinct from the sort of  intelligence that - does it know

295
00:32:04.624 --> 00:32:07.944
I'm talking about it? The  intelligence that before they were

296
00:32:07.984 --> 00:32:11.660
doing things in robots, computers  and that doesn't have a sense of a

297
00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:15.648
body, it's a box? What happened  when people started trying to make

298
00:32:15.688 --> 00:32:19.912
robots that were controlled by AI  and computers, is that they found

299
00:32:19.952 --> 00:32:24.144
that the things that we thought  would be difficult like playing

300
00:32:24.184 --> 00:32:28.556
drafts or something like that were  extremely easy. What was difficult

301
00:32:28.596 --> 00:32:31.724
was moving the pieces. The  interaction with the world is very,

302
00:32:31.764 --> 00:32:37.364
very difficult and requires a lot  of computation, but we are

303
00:32:37.404 --> 00:32:40.584
completely unaware of this. What  about the ultimate goal of things

304
00:32:40.624 --> 00:32:45.380
like imagination or consciousness,  this would actually become

305
00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:48.768
conscious of its own body? I like  to think it's the most interesting

306
00:32:48.808 --> 00:32:52.368
question of all, but there are lots  of problems to overcome before we

307
00:32:52.408 --> 00:32:57.960
get to that stage. I happen to  believe it will be possible one day

308
00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.664
to build a machine that will have a  kind of consciousness, whether it's

309
00:33:02.704 --> 00:33:06.196
the same consciousness as ours,  whatever that means, will be an

310
00:33:06.236 --> 00:33:14.488
issue. I don't really believe we  are going to arrive at

311
00:33:14.528 --> 00:33:17.648
consciousness with a disembodied  computer. This robot suggests that

312
00:33:17.688 --> 00:33:27.536
human intelligence simply cannot be  divorced from the human body that

313
00:33:27.576 --> 00:33:30.848
created it. The hunt for AI has  ended up on an alternative path.

314
00:33:30.888 --> 00:33:40.848
It's not about hardware and  software, but about trying to

315
00:33:41.408 --> 00:33:44.636
replicate human biology. Back at  the circus school, I'm still having

316
00:33:44.676 --> 00:33:50.664
problems with my own body as I  continue to struggle to get across

317
00:33:50.704 --> 00:33:57.148
the tightrope. Take that leg off  right away. Good. Up, up. Come on,

318
00:33:57.188 --> 00:34:02.728
fight it. It's a battle. You think  this isn't going to work, but the

319
00:34:02.768 --> 00:34:10.868
minute you reach up you are pulling  yourself back in line. It doesn't

320
00:34:10.908 --> 00:34:14.760
seem logical. It really didn't. I  was thinking that will do that. I

321
00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:19.464
feel there are lots of instructions  going on here and I've got to try

322
00:34:19.504 --> 00:34:27.056
to put them together and maybe I'm  - well, I don't know, whether I'm

323
00:34:27.096 --> 00:34:33.432
ever going to be able to do this.  This is something -- is this

324
00:34:33.472 --> 00:34:36.728
something instinctive I'll be able  to learn, or whatever? Move, move,

325
00:34:36.768 --> 00:34:45.208
move. If you are doing maths, you  are thinking, thinking, you need to

326
00:34:45.248 --> 00:34:49.560
clear that. This feels really alien.  But when I take a step back I

327
00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:55.824
realise that I've done something  very similar to this before. That's

328
00:34:55.864 --> 00:35:01.716
when I learnt to walk as a child.  Really relax your brain. Hands up.

329
00:35:01.756 --> 00:35:04.480
Step. Come on. I need to get mean  now. Hands up. What's truly

330
00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:08.588
remarkable about our brains is that  everything we learn to do from

331
00:35:08.628 --> 00:35:18.588
seeing, thinking, walking and  talking, becomes automatic when

332
00:35:19.064 --> 00:35:26.920
practice. Go, go, go. Don't rush.  Hands up. Hands up! We'll try a

333
00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:30.840
little bit of military technique.  Use a whip now! This ability to

334
00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:35.744
learn to do something instinctively,  without even thinking about it, is

335
00:35:35.784 --> 00:35:45.744
what makes us human. Getting a  machine to do this is one hell of a

336
00:35:51.628 --> 00:35:59.416
task. Getting a computer to see has  become one of the most difficult

337
00:35:59.456 --> 00:36:09.416
challenges in AI. Our vision is key  to our intelligence. Without it how

338
00:36:16.252 --> 00:36:20.280
would we perceive the world around  us? The one scientist -- for one

339
00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:29.480
scientist, the challenge has been  to get a computer to be able to

340
00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:32.856
monitor and interpret CCTV footage,  like a human does. You would think

341
00:36:32.896 --> 00:36:36.652
with the power of computers and a  mainframe in here scanning all the

342
00:36:36.692 --> 00:36:40.184
programmes we can write, you would  be able to pick up We haven't

343
00:36:40.224 --> 00:36:45.544
written the programme that can do  this sort of thing. It's so

344
00:36:45.584 --> 00:36:49.528
difficult for a computer to pick  out the needles in the haystacks.

345
00:36:49.568 --> 00:36:54.120
Our brains have learnt to control  our eye movements effortlessly,

346
00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:59.216
taking in the whole seen. We  instantly combine this with our

347
00:36:59.256 --> 00:37:03.748
previous knowledge of what a car,  bus, person or building looks like.

348
00:37:03.788 --> 00:37:09.528
In less than seconds we can make  sense of all the activity that's

349
00:37:09.568 --> 00:37:14.216
going on in busy Piccadilly Circus.  For a computer to recognise just

350
00:37:14.256 --> 00:37:22.028
one of these elements, is almost  impossible. James wants to show me

351
00:37:22.068 --> 00:37:30.280
why this is. This is a simple  programme to demonstrate how

352
00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:33.968
difficult vision is. What it does  is remove our hardware, our vision

353
00:37:34.008 --> 00:37:38.280
processing hardware from the  problem, so we have to process each

354
00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:43.672
bit of the image piece by piece,  rather like a computer has to.

355
00:37:43.712 --> 00:37:48.560
challenge is to try to recognise a  few familiar faces. It's through a

356
00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:55.640
tiny dot on the screen. Is this  somebody I should know? Yep, you

357
00:37:55.680 --> 00:38:00.264
should know all of these. OK. I've  found the eye. OK. I've got a bit

358
00:38:00.304 --> 00:38:04.968
of clothing there. Check shirt.  Exactly. You can put all this

359
00:38:05.008 --> 00:38:12.528
together, Marcus. Then I should get  it? Yeah. I don't know. Give in on

360
00:38:12.568 --> 00:38:22.528
that one. Stephen Hawking.  again. Another face. It's weird, I

361
00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:27.264
can pick out eyes and nose and  mouth. Putting that all together in

362
00:38:27.304 --> 00:38:37.264
bits, but it doesn't have enough  hair for Einstein. It's relevant

363
00:38:38.352 --> 00:38:46.312
for this programme. OK. Alan Turing.  We'll have one more. Beyond picking

364
00:38:46.352 --> 00:38:54.656
out that this is a face, I think  just the little pieces kind of

365
00:38:54.696 --> 00:38:59.624
piece by piece - all right, it's me.  I don't spend ages looking at me.

366
00:38:59.664 --> 00:39:04.112
It really demonstrates how  difficult it is. A computer can

367
00:39:04.152 --> 00:39:06.768
only interpret one small business  of the image at a time. But we have

368
00:39:06.808 --> 00:39:10.656
learnt to piece all the pixels  together and see the whole thing

369
00:39:10.696 --> 00:39:15.968
with no effort at all. James has  been wrestling with the problems

370
00:39:16.008 --> 00:39:20.596
for years. He has done something  really interesting, I think. He's

371
00:39:20.636 --> 00:39:26.452
developed a piece of software that  uses ground-breaking technology to

372
00:39:26.492 --> 00:39:33.032
recognise individuals in a crowd.  He wants to use me as a guinea pig.

373
00:39:33.072 --> 00:39:37.016
What we'll do now is take you out  on to the streets and track you out

374
00:39:37.056 --> 00:39:40.860
and about. This means tracking you  as you go within a camera and then

375
00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:44.520
when you move on to a different  view, we'll track you into the new

376
00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:54.520
camera and try to find you there  and carry on to see how far we can

377
00:39:54.728 --> 00:40:00.688
take you. I'll be passing under the  gaze of the Dons of CCTV cameras in

378
00:40:00.728 --> 00:40:04.268
and around Piccadilly Circus. --  dozens. It's difficult for a

379
00:40:04.308 --> 00:40:08.908
computer to pick out, because as I  walk through the different camera

380
00:40:08.948 --> 00:40:16.064
shots my size and position changes  all the time. Whereas we can

381
00:40:16.104 --> 00:40:20.240
separate what is me and what isn't  without even thinking about it.

382
00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:22.800
James' computer system gives each  person a sequence of numbers and

383
00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:28.080
then attempts to recognise  individuals by matching their

384
00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:31.048
number between all the different  camera views. On the right-hand

385
00:40:31.088 --> 00:40:36.532
side of the screen we can see where  the computer has successfully

386
00:40:36.572 --> 00:40:40.080
picked me out of the crowd on my  journey around central London. In

387
00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:50.080
the end, I was tracked across five  views as I walked a quarter of a

388
00:40:51.292 --> 00:40:58.424
mile. James is making real progress  in getting a computer to recognise

389
00:40:58.464 --> 00:41:03.320
what it's looking at. But there's a  deeper question at stake here. --

390
00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:07.016
steak here. It's not just about --  stake here. It's not just about

391
00:41:07.056 --> 00:41:12.960
assigning objects, but what we see.  It's something that humans working

392
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.396
here don't have a problem with.  don't think we'll get rid of the

393
00:41:17.436 --> 00:41:21.300
human intervention. On a Friday or  Saturday night, we see lots of

394
00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:24.128
people, the ones who have had a  drink will mess about and play

395
00:41:24.168 --> 00:41:26.940
fight. I don't think a computer  would be able to tell the

396
00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:31.208
difference between a real and play  fight, because we can look at the

397
00:41:31.248 --> 00:41:35.096
expressions on faces and see if  they're smiling or if they're angry,

398
00:41:35.136 --> 00:41:41.192
so I don't think we're at that  stage. The chaos of the urban

399
00:41:41.232 --> 00:41:46.240
jungle. Exactly. The human eye is  still better. We are programmed to

400
00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:53.144
pick out something unusual. That's  weird. What are you found there?

401
00:41:53.184 --> 00:41:56.520
pair of shoes on a seat. I was  curious as to why they are there.

402
00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:00.520
It's kind of strange. I've looked  around to see who they might belong

403
00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:05.304
to why they might be there, a  couple of people have sat down next

404
00:42:05.344 --> 00:42:09.288
to them and walked away, so you  know they're not theirs, but I

405
00:42:09.328 --> 00:42:16.272
don't think a computer can be  programmed with the level of

406
00:42:16.312 --> 00:42:19.364
curiosity and that's a natural  human emotion. This desire to

407
00:42:19.404 --> 00:42:25.816
understand meaning is absolutely at  the forefront of artificial

408
00:42:25.856 --> 00:42:35.816
intelligence right now. Our brains  do it by learning complue

409
00:42:39.448 --> 00:42:43.972
experience and it's become a really  -- through experience and it's a --

410
00:42:44.012 --> 00:42:47.972
it's become a really complex  experience. I'm being reminded

411
00:42:48.012 --> 00:42:55.864
today what a great human thing it  is to be able to learn something

412
00:42:55.904 --> 00:43:01.708
through experience. You would learn  this pretty quick if you thought a

413
00:43:01.748 --> 00:43:06.320
crocodile was under you. Trying to  get across a wire encapsulates all

414
00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:09.208
the problems involved in getting a  machine to do a new task. Through

415
00:43:09.248 --> 00:43:16.712
the process of learning by  experience we are able to combine

416
00:43:16.752 --> 00:43:22.100
all the different abilities that  are needed. Like body control,

417
00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:30.680
reasoning and instinct. I've tried  everything to get across this wire.

418
00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:37.632
Nothing seems to be working. But  then Leila comes up with one little

419
00:43:37.672 --> 00:43:47.632
thing. Try a little song. It  releases any little tune. I'm

420
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:59.488
chatting to you now to try to relax  you a bit. La, la, la, la. Keep

421
00:43:59.528 --> 00:44:08.132
coming, don't stop. Keep the leg  down. Keep coming. Keep it small.

422
00:44:08.172 --> 00:44:13.228
Hands up. Hands up. Come on! That  was so easy. You were there.

423
00:44:13.268 --> 00:44:17.040
close and then my hand went down.  What you just did there, right to

424
00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:20.104
that point, looked really easy. I  thought you can cracked this. I

425
00:44:20.144 --> 00:44:25.368
don't know, sometimes the last, the  anticipation, it's the last step or

426
00:44:25.408 --> 00:44:29.896
something. This is the last bit.  You've got it, so keep that

427
00:44:29.936 --> 00:44:39.896
momentum going. We can't fully  explain how our brains learn in

428
00:44:40.016 --> 00:44:49.976
this way. I don't know where the  huming is helping, but it is.

429
00:45:09.376 --> 00:45:19.336
rush. Oh, yes, I'm rushing. Mm, mm,  Hand up. Leg off, hand up. Hand up.

430
00:45:21.532 --> 00:45:25.432
Little steps. Hands up. Hand up.  Hand up. Yes! It wasn't elegant.

431
00:45:25.472 --> 00:45:29.024
Frpbts it was pretty elegant.  Perfect. Well done. That is an

432
00:45:29.064 --> 00:45:32.588
amazing feeling to be able to get  from one end of the tightwire to

433
00:45:32.628 --> 00:45:38.260
the other. But that is the amazing  thing about human intelligence,

434
00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:41.356
just how adaptable it is, how I can  go from nothing to learning a new

435
00:45:41.396 --> 00:45:44.872
skill like doing the tightwire. If  you think about a computer, you

436
00:45:44.912 --> 00:45:50.464
would have to programme it  especially to be able to do such a

437
00:45:50.504 --> 00:46:00.464
something different and for it to  be lost again. Perhaps we can try

438
00:46:01.408 --> 00:46:09.368
the trapeze now? Yes, sure, great!  One other human quality we like to

439
00:46:09.408 --> 00:46:18.336
celebrate, and often link to  intelligence, is creativity. I have

440
00:46:18.376 --> 00:46:25.572
come to Paris, where the streets  are steeped in artistic culture. I

441
00:46:25.612 --> 00:46:28.980
am here to visit an unusual  artist's studio. Run by computer

442
00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:37.044
scientist Simon Colton, who is  normally based at Imperial College

443
00:46:37.084 --> 00:46:42.436
London. All these immap -- images  have been created not by him but by

444
00:46:42.476 --> 00:46:48.056
a computer. Because Simon wants to  find out if it is possible to break

445
00:46:48.096 --> 00:46:51.684
down the creative process into a  set of instructions. That is why I

446
00:46:51.724 --> 00:46:55.464
started simulating paint strokes.  And this is a good example of that.

447
00:46:55.504 --> 00:47:00.872
As well as programming it with  painting techniques, Simon gives

448
00:47:00.912 --> 00:47:04.980
the computer rules about different  artistic styles. We can choose a

449
00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:10.560
painting style according to the  emotion of the sitter. So it is

450
00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:15.516
kind of feeding off its suant and  trying to tap in and appreciate its

451
00:47:15.556 --> 00:47:21.340
mood. His of her mood and express  that through the art. I can see

452
00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:26.280
what a difficult task this is. But  there is one image that has really

453
00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:31.232
caught my eye. I love this one.  Lots of comments from people.

454
00:47:31.272 --> 00:47:38.216
is what dancers? That is right. But  these people don't really exist.

455
00:47:38.256 --> 00:47:42.360
This isn't a photo that, or a video  it has looked at. It is taking some

456
00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:46.608
concept of people fed into it.  you watch it being painted it

457
00:47:46.648 --> 00:47:50.468
paints it all in one stroke. This  is a single line. Is that is what

458
00:47:50.508 --> 00:47:54.624
is giving it this sense of energy  and motion? That is right. Yes.

459
00:47:54.664 --> 00:47:58.576
That is a classic example of where  you put in a rule, where you have

460
00:47:58.616 --> 00:48:05.000
more out of it than you put in I  had no idea that I would get this

461
00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:08.652
kind of effect. I had no idea it  would give such a dynamism. I say

462
00:48:08.692 --> 00:48:12.420
that real creativity makes you  think more, so the software we are

463
00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:18.280
developing, that will make us think  more not less. Just like every

464
00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:21.280
artist or musician or poet wants us  to think more. So, I see a

465
00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:28.328
different future for AI which is  somewhere software is out there to

466
00:48:28.368 --> 00:48:36.312
challenge you. So if these  creations are meant to challenge us,

467
00:48:36.352 --> 00:48:45.920
what do the city's artists make of  them? There is something sexual. In

468
00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:52.752
this artwork. Interesting. Like  bacon, like monkey. You are seeing

469
00:48:52.792 --> 00:48:57.468
bacon and monkey? That is  interesting. Is it a man or ma heen

470
00:48:57.508 --> 00:49:02.424
who does the paintings. Why do you  think? Was a it is done

471
00:49:02.464 --> 00:49:09.500
automatically. How can you tell,  you are right, but, I am interested.

472
00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:13.672
You can see it. For me I am not an  artist, so I would be hard pushed.

473
00:49:13.712 --> 00:49:18.484
What gives it away? There is no  sensibility. Really? You can pick

474
00:49:18.524 --> 00:49:23.264
that up. That is interesting. I  quite like the image, or some of

475
00:49:23.304 --> 00:49:28.408
them any way. It is clear that  trying to mimic something as

476
00:49:28.448 --> 00:49:38.408
elusive as raytivety remains a huge  challenge. -- creativity. But

477
00:49:39.244 --> 00:49:42.844
scientists are starting to put down  the first important building blocks.

478
00:49:42.884 --> 00:49:49.172
100 years the birth of the  visionary mathematician Alan Turing,

479
00:49:49.212 --> 00:49:55.704
we are discover hag the hunt for AI  is a more difficult problem than he

480
00:49:55.744 --> 00:49:59.520
or we ever imagined. Machines have  surpassed us as specific tasks, but

481
00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:06.344
the human brain sets the bar for  artificial intelligence extremely

482
00:50:06.384 --> 00:50:16.344
high, in its ability to constantly  learn new skills. Hard wear and

483
00:50:18.776 --> 00:50:25.644
software, are struggling to mimic  our biology. But maybe there is

484
00:50:25.684 --> 00:50:29.192
another way to create a thinking  machine. That can capture the

485
00:50:29.232 --> 00:50:35.048
versatility of the human brain. I  have come to Berlin, for the

486
00:50:35.088 --> 00:50:39.328
highlight of my journey. To meet a  scientist who believes that for

487
00:50:39.368 --> 00:50:45.864
something to be truly intelligent,  it needs to develop and evolve like

488
00:50:45.904 --> 00:50:49.396
we did at the very beginning of our  lives and as a species. If you want

489
00:50:49.436 --> 00:50:55.676
to understand how to create or  understand intelligence in some way,

490
00:50:55.716 --> 00:50:59.564
we have to capture this  evolutionary adaptive aspect of it.

491
00:50:59.604 --> 00:51:03.940
So we cannot programme  intelligence? We cannot hope to

492
00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:11.552
give it the purpose and do the  learning and, a lot of people think

493
00:51:11.592 --> 00:51:17.348
that today, but it, we have to  understand this continuous adaptive

494
00:51:17.388 --> 00:51:25.252
nature, this flexibility, also this  motivation to continue to learn, to

495
00:51:25.292 --> 00:51:30.004
be excited about new thing, to seek  out new things. Luc is taking me to

496
00:51:30.044 --> 00:51:40.004
a lab on the outskirts of the city.  To show me some robots that are

497
00:51:40.464 --> 00:51:45.064
starting to do something remarkable.  Three of them. They are punch

498
00:51:45.104 --> 00:51:55.064
larger than I thought they were  going to be. -- much. These robots

499
00:51:58.156 --> 00:52:03.784
have been set up to develop much  They are beginning to understand

500
00:52:03.824 --> 00:52:08.880
how their bodies work, by looking  at a reflection of themselves. You

501
00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:12.192
have a mirror, so what is the....  Well the experiment is about that

502
00:52:12.232 --> 00:52:18.408
the robot would learn something  about its own body, because in

503
00:52:18.448 --> 00:52:22.040
order to move in the world, in  order to control it, in order to

504
00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:26.400
also recognise the movements of  another, you need to have some sort

505
00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:33.476
of model of your own body. Right.  The way that the model is going to

506
00:52:33.516 --> 00:52:39.084
be built up is that the robot is  doing actions, and watching itself.

507
00:52:39.124 --> 00:52:44.788
Performing the actions. So to get a  relation between the visual image,

508
00:52:44.828 --> 00:52:50.332
and movement of the motor for. So  here you see this looking at the

509
00:52:50.372 --> 00:52:55.692
its hand. You also see very much  how I was trying to keep balance.

510
00:52:55.732 --> 00:53:04.148
It is very impressive. How all the  motor commands are in an early

511
00:53:04.188 --> 00:53:11.100
phase, right. Well caught! It has  just woken up. I know that feeling.

512
00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:15.176
I think this was a beautiful  example of feedback, and of finding

513
00:53:15.216 --> 00:53:23.648
balance. It is extraordinary. It  really does look like it is

514
00:53:23.688 --> 00:53:28.600
encountering itself for the first  time. But what is even more

515
00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:33.400
remarkable about Luc's robots, is  that once they are able to

516
00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:40.916
recognise themselves, they start to  evolve their own language and

517
00:53:40.956 --> 00:53:45.368
communicate with each other. So  what will happen now? Well, one of

518
00:53:45.408 --> 00:53:48.632
them is going to speak, then he is  going o to ask the other one to do

519
00:53:48.672 --> 00:53:54.208
an action. He is going to invent a  word, because he doesn't have yet

520
00:53:54.248 --> 00:53:58.556
the word to maim that action.  OK, so then he says the word and

521
00:53:58.596 --> 00:54:05.648
this one isn't sure whether what it  could mean, this is a brand-new

522
00:54:05.688 --> 00:54:08.820
word, so he will make a guess, and  if the guess is OK, totally by luck,

523
00:54:08.860 --> 00:54:12.616
well they both know this word and  they know for the future they can

524
00:54:12.656 --> 00:54:17.196
use this word to communicate with  each other. What if he gets it

525
00:54:17.236 --> 00:54:24.460
wrong? If it gets it wrong this one  will say this is not what I had in

526
00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:33.384
mind. He will show it. OK. I mean I  don't know which one is going to

527
00:54:33.424 --> 00:54:40.164
speak first. OK, he is speaking  first. He is doing the action.

528
00:54:40.204 --> 00:54:43.336
is fantastic. OK. Notice how he  looked. So he is... He is doing the

529
00:54:43.376 --> 00:54:50.072
real action. So now there is  another interaction going to happen

530
00:54:50.112 --> 00:54:57.228
again. I don't know which one is  going to speak. OK. Is that the

531
00:54:57.268 --> 00:55:03.808
word it just learned. Kimato?  doing it. He will say yes,

532
00:55:03.848 --> 00:55:10.208
presumably. Yes. So would they  interact with me, to learn this

533
00:55:10.248 --> 00:55:19.792
language? Yes, we could try it.  Do you remember any one of the

534
00:55:19.832 --> 00:55:24.368
words. We will see. In is scary.  Gosh it has asked me to do

535
00:55:24.408 --> 00:55:34.368
something. Kimato. What was that?  Was it that, have I got it right.

536
00:55:36.004 --> 00:55:41.076
OK, you tell me what Kimato is. OK,  that is right. All right. Tomima.

537
00:55:41.116 --> 00:55:49.200
Tomima. I think that was lifting my  right arm. Did it get it right. Yes.

538
00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:53.852
I am learning robot! What would you  say to people that would suggest

539
00:55:53.892 --> 00:55:57.884
that, well this looks simple. They  are doing a few action, swapping

540
00:55:57.924 --> 00:56:03.716
words what is the big deal?  first thing I would say to people,

541
00:56:03.756 --> 00:56:08.872
just try it yourself, OK, just try  to build a robot that stands up.

542
00:56:08.912 --> 00:56:12.620
And then, you already will see its  extraordinary complicated. How fast

543
00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:16.588
do you think the development will  be in of the intelligence of these

544
00:56:16.628 --> 00:56:20.480
robot, such they are beginning to  create a new language between

545
00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:25.400
themselves, but how long will it be  before they are, I don't know,

546
00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:30.464
creating great works of art, the  sort of things that we can do?

547
00:56:30.504 --> 00:56:36.152
know, if we have these two robots  and we let them alone. We come back

548
00:56:36.192 --> 00:56:39.248
at the end o of the day and they  will have developed a vocabulary

549
00:56:39.288 --> 00:56:44.888
for co-ordinating their action,  once they start talking about

550
00:56:44.928 --> 00:56:48.980
shapes and colours and we don't  know when they say Bobita do they

551
00:56:49.020 --> 00:56:53.000
mean a colour or a position in  space. You will be going through

552
00:56:53.040 --> 00:57:01.808
the same process that the robot did  to acquire that language, I mean...

553
00:57:01.848 --> 00:57:05.368
Yeah. The exciting thing about the  robots, is they have their own

554
00:57:05.408 --> 00:57:11.324
evolutionary journey to go on.  Tomima. Which could happen much

555
00:57:11.364 --> 00:57:18.028
quicker than ours. And they open up  the possibility for intelligences

556
00:57:18.068 --> 00:57:22.360
very different from our own to  emerge. That was a striking example

557
00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:25.796
of a merging intelligence,  something which wasn't

558
00:57:25.836 --> 00:57:30.280
preprogrammed. Those robots really  started with a pretty blank sheet,

559
00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:35.872
and by the end of the day just  talking to each other, they had

560
00:57:35.912 --> 00:57:39.640
evolved their own language. A Laing  cadge I couldn't really understand.

561
00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:49.640
Turing asked can machines think? I  think he would be excited by what I

562
00:57:50.068 --> 00:57:54.876
-- a language I couldn't understand.  I have discovered that computers

563
00:57:54.916 --> 00:58:00.448
have far surpassed humans in many  fields but are unlikely to put us

564
00:58:00.488 --> 00:58:07.060
out of business yet. Because these  super machines haven't come close

565
00:58:07.100 --> 00:58:11.448
to capturing the true nature of our  intelligence. But I also learned

566
00:58:11.488 --> 00:58:15.764
how closely our intelligence is  linked to our biology. And that

567
00:58:15.804 --> 00:58:25.764
perhaps the secret to creating  thinking machines lies in letting

568
00:58:33.648 --> 00:58:39.216
But the one thought that has been  creeping up on me throughout all of

569
00:58:39.256 --> 00:58:44.124
this, is that maybe we have become  obsessed with our own abilities.

570
00:58:44.164 --> 00:58:48.484
And are blinded by being human. It  does raise the question about

571
00:58:48.524 --> 00:58:54.064
whether we should be bothering to  try and recreate what is us, when

572
00:58:54.104 --> 00:58:59.168
machines can do something so  different to what human beings can.
