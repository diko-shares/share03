1
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.891
- W-O-R-K.

2
00:01:01.604 --> 00:01:02.396
Work.

3
00:01:03.564 --> 00:01:07.735
Today we're going to share
what our parents do for...

4
00:01:07.735 --> 00:01:08.569
- Work!

5
00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:10.988
- Work!

6
00:01:10.988 --> 00:01:12.823
- My mommy is a doctor.

7
00:01:12.823 --> 00:01:15.284
- My daddy is a truck driver.

8
00:01:15.284 --> 00:01:17.036
- My mom's a teacher.

9
00:01:17.036 --> 00:01:18.037
- And your dad?

10
00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:20.498
- My dad...

11
00:01:22.083 --> 00:01:23.084
He's...

12
00:01:24.126 --> 00:01:25.461
A liar.

13
00:01:25.461 --> 00:01:27.171
- A liar?

14
00:01:27.171 --> 00:01:30.466
Oh, I'm sure you don't
mean a liar.

15
00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:32.802
- Well, he wears a suit and goes to court

16
00:01:32.802 --> 00:01:34.303
and talks to the judge.

17
00:01:34.303 --> 00:01:36.556
- Oh! Oh! I see.

18
00:01:36.556 --> 00:01:38.516
You mean he's a lawyer.

19
00:01:45.648 --> 00:01:47.483
- Hey, Fletcher.
How'd it go in there?

20
00:01:47.483 --> 00:01:49.694
- Just another victory
for the wrongly accused.

21
00:01:49.694 --> 00:01:50.528
- Yeah right.

22
00:01:51.362 --> 00:01:53.322
- Mr. Reede, great job sir.
Do you want your coat back?

23
00:01:53.322 --> 00:01:56.075
- No, I'm sure you'll be
needing it again and again.

24
00:01:56.075 --> 00:01:57.410
- Mr. Reede, do you have a moment?

25
00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.704
- I'm sorry, I'm very late.
It's my day to be with my son.

26
00:01:59.704 --> 00:02:01.330
- A couple of reporters wanna talk to you

27
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.790
about your big win today.

28
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.875
- Oh, yeah? How's my hair?

29
00:02:04.875 --> 00:02:06.168
- Fabulous. You look great.

30
00:02:22.143 --> 00:02:23.144
- What time is it?

31
00:02:24.186 --> 00:02:27.356
- I'm sure your dad just
got held up in court again.

32
00:02:34.405 --> 00:02:35.865
- Dad!

33
00:02:35.865 --> 00:02:37.283
- Maximilian!

34
00:02:40.995 --> 00:02:42.121
Hey!

35
00:02:42.121 --> 00:02:44.123
How you doing, creep?

36
00:02:44.123 --> 00:02:44.957
- Good.

37
00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.254
- Me too, except my arm has
really been bothering me lately.

38
00:02:50.254 --> 00:02:52.256
- Oh, no, dad!

39
00:02:52.256 --> 00:02:53.507
- Oh, yeah!

40
00:02:53.507 --> 00:02:55.384
It's becoming a claw!

41
00:03:00.306 --> 00:03:03.059
Nothing can stop the claw!

42
00:03:05.936 --> 00:03:10.191
Run, boy! Run! Save yourself!

43
00:03:10.191 --> 00:03:12.693
- Do the claw to mom,
dad! Do the claw to mom!

44
00:03:12.693 --> 00:03:16.489
- Uh-oh! You found the
claw's only weakness.

45
00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.575
Sub-zero temperatures!

46
00:03:20.868 --> 00:03:23.412
- So, did you have any
trouble finding the place?

47
00:03:23.412 --> 00:03:26.874
- Okay, I'm late. I'm
sorry. I ran out of gas.

48
00:03:26.874 --> 00:03:30.086
The gauge is broken or something.

49
00:03:30.086 --> 00:03:30.920
Rough neighborhood, too.

50
00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.381
It's a good thing I was
wearing neutral gang colors.

51
00:03:33.381 --> 00:03:36.092
I might've had to pull out
my nine and bust a cap.

52
00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:41.180
- Well, they would never
hurt you, Fletcher,

53
00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.765
you're their lawyer.

54
00:03:42.765 --> 00:03:46.435
- Oh! That was below the
belt. Try Keep the gloves up.

55
00:03:46.435 --> 00:03:48.688
- Mom, dad's taking me to see wrestling!

56
00:03:48.688 --> 00:03:50.189
- Fletcher!

57
00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:51.649
- Audrey!

58
00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:53.776
- Why do you have to take
him to see that stuff?

59
00:03:53.776 --> 00:03:55.152
It's very violent.

60
00:03:55.152 --> 00:03:59.323
- The boy must grow to
be a warrior.

61
00:03:59.323 --> 00:04:01.367
Who better to guide him than Rick Rude

62
00:04:01.367 --> 00:04:04.704
and Randy "Macho-Man"
Savage in the Cage of Death?

63
00:04:07.248 --> 00:04:08.457
Good!

64
00:04:08.457 --> 00:04:09.667
- Jerry, how's it going?

65
00:04:10.584 --> 00:04:13.295
- Hey, Gipper! Look at you.

66
00:04:13.295 --> 00:04:15.506
You look like you grow by the minute!

67
00:04:15.506 --> 00:04:16.841
- Fletcher, pleasure to see you.

68
00:04:16.841 --> 00:04:17.675
- Hey.

69
00:04:17.675 --> 00:04:18.926
- Hi, honey!
- Hi.

70
00:04:20.845 --> 00:04:25.808
- Wow, that was a nice
image. Deleted.

71
00:04:26.267 --> 00:04:27.643
- I have some more boxes for you.

72
00:04:27.643 --> 00:04:28.936
- Oh! You're an angel.

73
00:04:28.936 --> 00:04:30.521
- Boxes?
- Yeah.

74
00:04:30.521 --> 00:04:32.148
Remember? I told you a few weeks ago.

75
00:04:32.148 --> 00:04:33.816
Jerry's moving to Boston on Friday.

76
00:04:33.816 --> 00:04:38.863
- Oh, right! The job, the
thing... What do you do again?

77
00:04:38.863 --> 00:04:39.989
- Hospital administrator.

78
00:04:39.989 --> 00:04:41.282
- Right! Right!

79
00:04:41.282 --> 00:04:43.033
- Well, the boxes are in my car.

80
00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:44.785
- Oh, those can wait.

81
00:04:44.785 --> 00:04:47.204
I made this young man a promise, didn't I?

82
00:04:48.831 --> 00:04:50.166
Got time to throw a few?

83
00:04:50.166 --> 00:04:51.000
- Sure!

84
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.627
- Come on, then!

85
00:04:53.627 --> 00:04:55.171
- I forgot the boyfriend was moving.

86
00:04:55.171 --> 00:04:59.175
- Jerry! His name is Jerry!
And yes, he's moving.

87
00:04:59.175 --> 00:05:01.218
- I'm sorry, I hated him a lot less

88
00:05:01.218 --> 00:05:04.013
than your other boyfriends,
it wasn't serious, was it?

89
00:05:04.013 --> 00:05:05.931
- Semi-serious, yes.

90
00:05:05.931 --> 00:05:10.019
- You guys aren't, you know...

91
00:05:13.022 --> 00:05:15.441
- I've been dating him for
seven months. What do you think?

92
00:05:15.441 --> 00:05:17.026
- Really? Ew!

93
00:05:17.026 --> 00:05:19.028
I was hoping after being married to me

94
00:05:19.028 --> 00:05:20.154
you'd have no strength left.

95
00:05:20.154 --> 00:05:22.239
- Well, you have to remember
that when we were married,

96
00:05:22.239 --> 00:05:24.492
I wasn't having sex nearly
as often as you were?

97
00:05:24.492 --> 00:05:25.993
- Ouch!

98
00:05:25.993 --> 00:05:27.995
And the ref takes a point away.

99
00:05:27.995 --> 00:05:29.789
- Yeah.
- Oh! Oh! And Out!

100
00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:30.915
- Yeah! Whoo!

101
00:05:30.915 --> 00:05:32.082
- Max is gonna miss him.

102
00:05:33.793 --> 00:05:34.585
- I'll be here.

103
00:05:35.711 --> 00:05:36.545
- Ready?

104
00:05:37.922 --> 00:05:39.298
Yeah!

105
00:05:39.298 --> 00:05:40.216
Play ball.

106
00:05:40.216 --> 00:05:42.092
- Max, come on. We've gotta go.

107
00:05:43.344 --> 00:05:45.429
- Dad, are we really going to wrestling?

108
00:05:45.429 --> 00:05:47.014
- Absolutely, Max Factor.

109
00:05:47.014 --> 00:05:49.433
We just have to stop by
the office for a minute.

110
00:05:49.433 --> 00:05:51.060
- Excuse me, sir. Any spare change?

111
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.770
- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm all out.

112
00:05:53.854 --> 00:05:54.688
-I can'tdo it.

113
00:05:55.564 --> 00:05:57.775
- Fred, it's your duty to present

114
00:05:57.775 --> 00:05:59.985
the strongest case possible.

115
00:05:59.985 --> 00:06:02.571
- The strongest case possible
consistent with the truth.

116
00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:04.532
- Will you let the judge
decide what's true?

117
00:06:04.532 --> 00:06:08.410
That's what he gets paid
for. You get paid to win.

118
00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.996
- If you insist that I take it to trial,

119
00:06:10.996 --> 00:06:14.834
I will represent Mrs. Cole
aggressively and ethically,

120
00:06:14.834 --> 00:06:17.586
but, Miranda, I won't lie.

121
00:06:19.004 --> 00:06:22.049
- Then we'll just have
to find someone who will.

122
00:06:23.926 --> 00:06:26.595
- 21st floor. Men's wear.

123
00:06:31.183 --> 00:06:32.560
- Hi, Mr. Reede!

124
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.103
- Whoa! Hey.

125
00:06:35.271 --> 00:06:36.814
Did you do something to your hair?

126
00:06:36.814 --> 00:06:39.275
- It's a bit extreme, isn't it?

127
00:06:39.275 --> 00:06:43.153
- No! I mean that's... That's
the thing nowadays, right?

128
00:06:43.153 --> 00:06:45.573
- Well, he said it would
accent my facial features.

129
00:06:45.573 --> 00:06:46.490
- Well, that's what it does!

130
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.576
It completely accents
your facial features.

131
00:06:49.785 --> 00:06:53.289
We're just gonna go to
my office now.

132
00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:57.209
- Hey, Fletcher.

133
00:06:57.209 --> 00:06:59.086
- Hey, Pete. You losing a little weight?

134
00:06:59.086 --> 00:07:00.880
- I don't know. Maybe.

135
00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.591
- Looks and personality.
A double-threat guy.

136
00:07:03.591 --> 00:07:06.010
- Hey, Mr. Reede.
- Hey, man.

137
00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:07.052
- It's Randy.

138
00:07:07.052 --> 00:07:08.679
- Yeah, I know.

139
00:07:08.679 --> 00:07:10.931
- Taking lunch orders Mr. Reede. Anything?

140
00:07:10.931 --> 00:07:12.182
- No, thanks.

141
00:07:13.434 --> 00:07:17.062
I had so much for breakfast,
I'm just about ready to pop.

142
00:07:17.062 --> 00:07:18.939
I mean, I'm full.

143
00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:20.357
- Okay.

144
00:07:20.357 --> 00:07:21.400
Great.

145
00:07:25.321 --> 00:07:26.530
- Max!

146
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.157
- Hi, Greta.

147
00:07:28.157 --> 00:07:29.909
- Hey, what's new?

148
00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:31.410
- Well, it's my birthday's tomorrow,

149
00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:32.745
and we're having a party and everything.

150
00:07:32.745 --> 00:07:34.830
- Wow! I am sure that your daddy

151
00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:36.790
has got you something wonderful.

152
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:37.875
- Yeah?

153
00:07:37.875 --> 00:07:41.295
- Yeah! You bet!

154
00:07:41.295 --> 00:07:42.963
Listen, kiddo, why don't you go

155
00:07:42.963 --> 00:07:44.298
play in my office for a minute?

156
00:07:44.298 --> 00:07:46.550
Sue somebody for everything they've got.

157
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:49.553
Maybe you can send a fax
to one of your girlfriends.

158
00:07:49.553 --> 00:07:50.804
Hey, sorry.

159
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.516
Damn it! I completely forgot.

160
00:07:54.516 --> 00:07:55.726
- Oh. What a surprise?

161
00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.730
- You are a saint. I
should buy you a gift.

162
00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:01.273
- You did.

163
00:08:01.273 --> 00:08:03.192
- I always do the classy thing. Any calls?

164
00:08:03.192 --> 00:08:05.527
- Judge Rollins' clerk
he needs your filing.

165
00:08:05.527 --> 00:08:06.654
- Tell him it's in the mail.

166
00:08:06.654 --> 00:08:08.364
- Right, you'll do it next week.

167
00:08:08.364 --> 00:08:11.909
Mr. McKinley phoned to
confirm your meeting tomorrow.

168
00:08:11.909 --> 00:08:14.828
- Strep throat. No, some kind
of virus, what's going around?

169
00:08:14.828 --> 00:08:15.746
- Asian flu?

170
00:08:15.746 --> 00:08:16.956
- Good one.

171
00:08:16.956 --> 00:08:18.332
- And your mother called.

172
00:08:18.332 --> 00:08:19.750
- I'm on vacation.

173
00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:20.876
- It's your fifth week.

174
00:08:20.876 --> 00:08:22.252
- Snowed in, phones are down.

175
00:08:22.252 --> 00:08:23.837
- Break mother's heart. Done.

176
00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:26.382
Now, that's it, except
Miranda's looking for you.

177
00:08:27.967 --> 00:08:30.052
- How much ass do I have to kiss

178
00:08:30.052 --> 00:08:32.429
to make partner in this damn place?

179
00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:35.474
Tell her I broke my
leg and had to be shot.

180
00:08:35.474 --> 00:08:37.810
- Why don't you tell her yourself?

181
00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:41.271
- And then send out a notice
of judgment on my win today!

182
00:08:41.271 --> 00:08:42.398
- I'll get right on it.

183
00:08:43.399 --> 00:08:48.362
- Miranda! Hey, I didn't see
you. You look beautiful today.

184
00:08:49.405 --> 00:08:51.740
Here! I bought you a gift.

185
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:56.495
- Oh! Thanks. I heard about
your victory, congratulations.

186
00:08:56.495 --> 00:08:58.080
You know, you're making
quite an impression

187
00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.456
on the partnership committee.

188
00:09:00.374 --> 00:09:03.877
- Oh, that's right! You
folks are meeting again soon.

189
00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:05.337
I've just been keeping myself so busy,

190
00:09:05.337 --> 00:09:07.965
I haven't even thought about it.

191
00:09:09.717 --> 00:09:12.428
Anyway, I have a client in my office.

192
00:09:12.428 --> 00:09:14.096
Better not keep him waiting.

193
00:09:14.096 --> 00:09:15.347
- Actually, Fletcher,

194
00:09:15.347 --> 00:09:17.474
something rather important
has just come up.

195
00:09:18.475 --> 00:09:20.769
You're not busy tonight, are you?

196
00:09:28.527 --> 00:09:29.987
- We're not going, are we?

197
00:09:43.751 --> 00:09:46.628
- Audrey, you know how
there are moments in life

198
00:09:46.628 --> 00:09:47.921
that you know are critical.

199
00:09:49.006 --> 00:09:50.966
And choices that have to be made,

200
00:09:50.966 --> 00:09:53.427
upon which all one's future
happiness will depend?

201
00:09:54.511 --> 00:09:56.180
Well, this is one of those moments.

202
00:09:58.307 --> 00:10:00.059
- What are you trying to say?

203
00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:02.895
- Will you marry me?

204
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.485
- You're moving.
- I know.

205
00:10:09.485 --> 00:10:10.402
I'm moving to Boston, but I want

206
00:10:10.402 --> 00:10:12.196
you and Max to come with me.

207
00:10:12.196 --> 00:10:14.239
Audrey, I've been giving
this a lot of thought.

208
00:10:14.239 --> 00:10:15.741
And you know I'm not prone to wild,

209
00:10:15.741 --> 00:10:18.619
spontaneous flights of
romantic fancy.

210
00:10:18.619 --> 00:10:19.745
But the thought of you and I together

211
00:10:19.745 --> 00:10:21.997
just makes too much sense to ignore.

212
00:10:21.997 --> 00:10:23.832
Now, I'm ready, I think you're ready,

213
00:10:23.832 --> 00:10:28.253
I love Max, you love Max, it's
right, it fits.

214
00:10:28.253 --> 00:10:30.130
So what do you say?

215
00:10:48.023 --> 00:10:51.527
- Hey, creepy. Happy birthday.

216
00:10:51.527 --> 00:10:53.612
How old are you now, 22, 23?

217
00:10:53.612 --> 00:10:55.572
- I'm five, dad.

218
00:10:55.572 --> 00:10:57.074
- Okay.

219
00:10:57.074 --> 00:10:59.868
Return the beer keg.

220
00:10:59.868 --> 00:11:03.038
Cancel the dancing girls.

221
00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:06.250
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

222
00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:09.044
I feel completely unprepared for this.

223
00:11:09.044 --> 00:11:11.672
You see, I bought you a
present, but last night,

224
00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:14.591
I accidentally swallowed it.

225
00:11:14.591 --> 00:11:17.010
- Dad, it's in your belly!

226
00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:17.803
- Scalpel.

227
00:11:18.762 --> 00:11:21.223
I hope it's not partially digested!

228
00:11:21.223 --> 00:11:23.308
Look out!

229
00:11:23.308 --> 00:11:24.226
- Cool!

230
00:11:24.226 --> 00:11:25.144
- Cool!

231
00:11:25.144 --> 00:11:26.728
- What is it?

232
00:11:26.728 --> 00:11:29.815
- It's a surprise.

233
00:11:29.815 --> 00:11:31.608
All right, it's a pony. Just open it!

234
00:11:32.651 --> 00:11:35.112
I'm gonna help, ‘cause I can't stand it!

235
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:39.408
- Baseball stuff!

236
00:11:39.408 --> 00:11:41.702
- Baseball stuff!

237
00:11:41.702 --> 00:11:43.162
- Cool!

238
00:11:43.162 --> 00:11:45.330
Can we play? I'll be Nomo.

239
00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.000
You can be Jose Canseco. Can
we play dad? Can we play?

240
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.668
- Absolutely.

241
00:11:49.668 --> 00:11:50.669
- Yay!

242
00:11:50.669 --> 00:11:53.463
- Right after
your party tonight,

243
00:11:53.463 --> 00:11:55.382
we'll do it, you and me.

244
00:11:57.259 --> 00:12:00.512
I just have to really
concentrate on this right now.

245
00:12:24.119 --> 00:12:24.912
- Hi!

246
00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:27.956
Hey!

247
00:12:27.956 --> 00:12:29.499
Happy birthday.

248
00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:30.709
- Thanks, mom.

249
00:12:30.709 --> 00:12:33.253
- Happy birthday, Max!

250
00:12:33.253 --> 00:12:38.008
One, two, three, four,
five, and one for good luck!

251
00:12:38.008 --> 00:12:39.635
- He struck the child. Did you see that?

252
00:12:39.635 --> 00:12:41.678
- Look at what Dad got me!

253
00:12:41.678 --> 00:12:42.763
- Whoa!

254
00:12:42.763 --> 00:12:44.598
Great!

255
00:12:44.598 --> 00:12:46.892
Hey, you know what, I
have my glove in the car.

256
00:12:46.892 --> 00:12:48.143
Maybe we can stop at the park

257
00:12:48.143 --> 00:12:50.062
on the way home and play catch.

258
00:12:50.062 --> 00:12:51.688
And then tonight we can rub oil in it

259
00:12:51.688 --> 00:12:53.398
and wrap a big rubber band around it.

260
00:12:53.398 --> 00:12:56.860
It'll be great. Hey, great gift, dad!

261
00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.487
- Thanks, son.

262
00:12:58.487 --> 00:13:00.989
I'm so glad my gift could
bring those two together.

263
00:13:00.989 --> 00:13:03.325
My plan to phase myself
out is almost complete.

264
00:13:05.202 --> 00:13:07.329
- Something's come up,
and we need to talk.

265
00:13:07.329 --> 00:13:10.040
- Come on, mom. I wanna go play!

266
00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.583
- And, actually, it's kind of important,

267
00:13:11.583 --> 00:13:13.252
so maybe we could talk tonight?

268
00:13:13.252 --> 00:13:14.544
- Tonight?

269
00:13:14.544 --> 00:13:17.089
- Yes. Max's birthday party.

270
00:13:17.089 --> 00:13:19.675
- Oh! Yeah. Sure, of course.

271
00:13:19.675 --> 00:13:21.468
We'll talk then. Great!

272
00:13:23.762 --> 00:13:25.430
Maximus! I'm outta here.

273
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:26.473
- Bye, dad.

274
00:13:26.473 --> 00:13:28.433
- Jerry, enjoy my wife.

275
00:13:44.491 --> 00:13:45.284
- Well,

276
00:13:46.451 --> 00:13:49.788
this is good, this is really smart.

277
00:13:49.788 --> 00:13:50.622
- Thank you.

278
00:13:50.622 --> 00:13:53.875
- Only, well, it's not true, I mean,

279
00:13:53.875 --> 00:13:56.086
does that present a problem?

280
00:13:58.005 --> 00:13:59.923
- Mrs. Cole, the only problem here

281
00:13:59.923 --> 00:14:02.759
is that after you've provided
years of faithful service

282
00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:05.095
and loving support of
raising his children...

283
00:14:05.095 --> 00:14:05.887
They are his?

284
00:14:07.014 --> 00:14:09.725
- Oh, yeah, yeah. One for sure.

285
00:14:11.643 --> 00:14:14.438
- After all that, your
husband want to denying you

286
00:14:14.438 --> 00:14:15.897
a fair share of the marital assets,

287
00:14:15.897 --> 00:14:17.941
based on one single act of indiscretion.

288
00:14:17.941 --> 00:14:18.775
- Seven.

289
00:14:18.775 --> 00:14:19.651
- Pardon me?

290
00:14:19.651 --> 00:14:22.612
- Seven single acts of indiscretion.

291
00:14:23.947 --> 00:14:25.991
- Seven acts of indiscretion,

292
00:14:25.991 --> 00:14:28.327
only one of which he has any evidence of,

293
00:14:28.327 --> 00:14:32.164
and all of which he
himself is responsible for.

294
00:14:32.164 --> 00:14:33.248
- He is?

295
00:14:33.248 --> 00:14:34.333
- Mrs. Cole.

296
00:14:35.292 --> 00:14:37.044
You're the victim here.

297
00:14:37.044 --> 00:14:39.254
The wife of a cold, distant workaholic.

298
00:14:39.254 --> 00:14:42.007
Starved for affection. Driven
into the arms of another man!

299
00:14:42.007 --> 00:14:44.009
- Seven.
- Yeah. Whatever!

300
00:14:44.009 --> 00:14:46.636
You're not trying to denying
him what is rightfully his.

301
00:14:46.636 --> 00:14:49.181
All you're insisting on is
what is rightfully yours.

302
00:14:49.181 --> 00:14:53.060
- Yeah
- And maybe a fraction more.

303
00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.562
I think you're bending over backwards.

304
00:14:55.562 --> 00:14:57.230
- Yeah.

305
00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:00.692
Well, I did offer to give him
joint custody of the kids.

306
00:15:00.692 --> 00:15:03.862
He is, after all, a wonderful father.

307
00:15:03.862 --> 00:15:05.238
- And how does he repay you?

308
00:15:06.573 --> 00:15:09.409
By dragging you through a
painful litigation process!

309
00:15:09.409 --> 00:15:13.372
No! No! No! No! This can't happen!

310
00:15:13.372 --> 00:15:14.706
With all due respect,

311
00:15:14.706 --> 00:15:16.833
this isn't about you and Mr. Cole anymore.

312
00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:18.752
This is about all women.

313
00:15:18.752 --> 00:15:20.670
Where would Tina Turner be right now,

314
00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:21.922
if she'd rolled over and said,

315
00:15:21.922 --> 00:15:25.634
"Hit me again, Ike, and
put some stank on it."

316
00:15:25.634 --> 00:15:28.011
Rolling on the river,
that's where she'd be.

317
00:15:28.011 --> 00:15:29.763
But she's beyond Thunder dome,

318
00:15:29.763 --> 00:15:32.307
because she decided to send a message.

319
00:15:32.307 --> 00:15:34.393
Wake up, sisters!

320
00:15:34.393 --> 00:15:35.185
There's no

321
00:15:37.145 --> 00:15:40.982
such thing as a weaker sex!

322
00:15:40.982 --> 00:15:43.110
- Oh!

323
00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:46.154
You know what? You're right, Mr. Reede.

324
00:15:46.154 --> 00:15:48.990
I am tired of getting kicked around!

325
00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:50.242
- Good for you!

326
00:15:51.618 --> 00:15:53.203
- Thank you,

327
00:15:53.203 --> 00:15:55.497
I am so grateful

328
00:15:55.497 --> 00:15:58.959
to have an attorney I can trust.

329
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:07.509
- Oh, you are good.

330
00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:10.762
You are very, very good.

331
00:16:12.722 --> 00:16:14.391
You know, the Cole case is worth a

332
00:16:14.391 --> 00:16:16.518
truckload of money to this firm.

333
00:16:16.518 --> 00:16:19.771
If you win, I guarantee
you'll make partner.

334
00:16:19.771 --> 00:16:20.564
- Oh.

335
00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:22.983
- In fact,

336
00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:26.903
how would you like to make

337
00:16:26.903 --> 00:16:28.196
a partner right now?

338
00:16:29.906 --> 00:16:32.075
- Oh, I don't know, I mean, I should...

339
00:16:39.583 --> 00:16:43.086
7 Happy, happy, happy,
happy, happy, happy, happy *

340
00:16:48.967 --> 00:16:51.678
- So, honey, have you...

341
00:16:51.678 --> 00:16:54.389
Have you thought about, you
know, what we talked about?

342
00:16:55.265 --> 00:16:56.141
- Yeah.
- Great.

343
00:16:56.141 --> 00:16:57.559
- I can't go.

344
00:16:57.559 --> 00:16:59.311
- What? Why not?

345
00:16:59.311 --> 00:17:01.188
- Well, because of Max.

346
00:17:01.188 --> 00:17:03.106
- Oh, but he'll love it there.

347
00:17:03.106 --> 00:17:05.317
I'm gonna take him to Fenway Park.

348
00:17:05.317 --> 00:17:07.486
There's hiking and camping and--

349
00:17:07.486 --> 00:17:11.448
- Well, really, it's Fletcher.

350
00:17:11.448 --> 00:17:13.992
- Fletcher? I mean, come on, honey.

351
00:17:13.992 --> 00:17:16.411
He wouldn't even come over
unless you reminded him.

352
00:17:16.411 --> 00:17:19.289
- Well, I know, but when he
does come over, Max is so happy.

353
00:17:19.289 --> 00:17:21.708
I mean, it's like they have
their own little world together.

354
00:17:21.708 --> 00:17:22.918
- The Gipper and I have that, too!

355
00:17:22.918 --> 00:17:24.669
- Well, I know, but it's different.

356
00:17:25.629 --> 00:17:26.546
- How?

357
00:17:26.546 --> 00:17:27.339
- Well...

358
00:17:29.424 --> 00:17:31.635
He does the claw.

359
00:17:31.635 --> 00:17:32.552
- The what?

360
00:17:32.552 --> 00:17:33.428
- The claw.

361
00:17:34.304 --> 00:17:35.847
You know, it's like this...

362
00:17:37.474 --> 00:17:39.684
I don't...

363
00:17:39.684 --> 00:17:41.811
Run for your life. It's
the claw! The claw!

364
00:17:49.361 --> 00:17:51.029
Well, I can't really do it that good.

365
00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:52.030
Anyway, that's not the point.

366
00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:53.240
The point is...

367
00:17:54.074 --> 00:17:55.283
If they're 3,000 miles apart,

368
00:17:55.283 --> 00:17:56.952
they'll never gonna see each other.

369
00:17:56.952 --> 00:17:58.620
I mean, Fletcher is never
gonna come to Boston.

370
00:18:01.581 --> 00:18:02.415
Hello.

371
00:18:02.415 --> 00:18:03.250
- Audrey?

372
00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:06.002
- Fletcher! Fletcher! Where are
you? We are waiting for you.

373
00:18:06.002 --> 00:18:08.922
Max won't cut the cake until you get here.

374
00:18:08.922 --> 00:18:10.840
- Oh, man!

375
00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.592
Actually, something has come up.

376
00:18:13.635 --> 00:18:15.887
I've got this problem on a new case!

377
00:18:15.887 --> 00:18:16.721
- What happened?

378
00:18:16.721 --> 00:18:17.556
- Nothing!

379
00:18:17.556 --> 00:18:19.933
I stubbed my toe on the desk!

380
00:18:19.933 --> 00:18:23.645
Listen, I'm really sorry,
but I just can't make it.

381
00:18:23.645 --> 00:18:26.690
The boss is really riding me.

382
00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:30.026
- Oh, Fletcher, it's his birthday!

383
00:18:30.026 --> 00:18:33.822
- I know, I know. I'll make
it up to him, I promise.

384
00:18:33.822 --> 00:18:35.615
I'll pick him up from
school tomorrow, okay.

385
00:18:35.615 --> 00:18:36.783
- You're gonna pick him up?

386
00:18:36.783 --> 00:18:37.993
- Yes! Yes!

387
00:18:37.993 --> 00:18:39.035
- All right, well, hold on a minute.

388
00:18:39.035 --> 00:18:41.079
I'll get him, you can
say, "Happy birthday".

389
00:18:41.079 --> 00:18:44.249
- No! Gotta go! Good-bye.

390
00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:46.918
- Hello.

391
00:19:03.226 --> 00:19:05.812
- Okay, birthday boy. Make a wish.

392
00:19:08.898 --> 00:19:12.235
Come on, Max. It can be anything you want.

393
00:19:12.235 --> 00:19:14.487
Anything in the whole world.

394
00:19:29.169 --> 00:19:29.961
Max,

395
00:19:31.838 --> 00:19:35.342
your father is sorry, he had to work.

396
00:19:35.342 --> 00:19:37.177
- He said he was gonna
be here. He promised.

397
00:19:37.177 --> 00:19:40.263
- I know, I know, but he promises

398
00:19:40.263 --> 00:19:43.642
that he is gonna see you tomorrow, okay.

399
00:19:43.642 --> 00:19:46.144
He's gonna pick you up
from school. All right?

400
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:49.981
So, come on.

401
00:19:51.816 --> 00:19:52.609
Make a wish.

402
00:20:05.538 --> 00:20:08.541
- I wish that for only one
day, dad couldn't tell a lie.

403
00:20:37.904 --> 00:20:39.698
- That was incredible.

404
00:20:41.825 --> 00:20:45.286
Was it good for you?

405
00:20:45.286 --> 00:20:46.371
- I've had better.

406
00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:56.798
"I've had better?"

407
00:21:00.176 --> 00:21:01.636
"I've had better?"

408
00:21:06.891 --> 00:21:10.812
"I've had better."

409
00:21:33.168 --> 00:21:34.252
Hi.
- Hi.

410
00:21:35.336 --> 00:21:36.546
- New in the building?

411
00:21:36.546 --> 00:21:38.131
- Yeah, I just moved in Monday.

412
00:21:38.131 --> 00:21:41.259
- Oh! You like it so far?

413
00:21:41.259 --> 00:21:42.927
- Everybody's been real nice.

414
00:21:42.927 --> 00:21:45.972
- Well, that's because you have big jugs.

415
00:21:45.972 --> 00:21:48.141
I mean, your boobs are huge.

416
00:21:48.141 --> 00:21:51.770
I mean, I want to squeeze them.

417
00:21:52.979 --> 00:21:53.855
Mama.

418
00:22:06.159 --> 00:22:07.577
- Any change, mister?

419
00:22:07.577 --> 00:22:08.787
- Absolutely.

420
00:22:08.787 --> 00:22:09.871
- Could you spare some?

421
00:22:09.871 --> 00:22:11.289
- Yes, I could.

422
00:22:11.289 --> 00:22:12.415
- Will you? How come?

423
00:22:13.792 --> 00:22:16.044
- Because I believe you
will buy booze with it!

424
00:22:16.044 --> 00:22:17.837
I just wanna get from my car to the office

425
00:22:17.837 --> 00:22:21.341
without being confronted by
the decay of Western society.

426
00:22:21.341 --> 00:22:24.052
Plus, I'm cheap!

427
00:22:25.261 --> 00:22:26.805
- Jerk-off!

428
00:22:57.585 --> 00:22:59.796
- You look like you're
having a rough morning.

429
00:22:59.796 --> 00:23:03.007
- Ding, ding, ding! What
do we have for her, Johnny?

430
00:23:04.634 --> 00:23:05.426
- Fletcher.

431
00:23:06.302 --> 00:23:07.554
- Dana.

432
00:23:07.554 --> 00:23:09.556
- All right Samantha,
how much will it take

433
00:23:09.556 --> 00:23:10.640
to put an end to all this?

434
00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:11.933
- 50% of your estate.

435
00:23:11.933 --> 00:23:14.853
- 50%°?

436
00:23:14.853 --> 00:23:18.314
With a prenup and proof of
adultery? What's your case?

437
00:23:18.314 --> 00:23:19.941
- Our case is simply this.

438
00:23:50.054 --> 00:23:51.764
- I can't stand this.

439
00:24:02.734 --> 00:24:04.903
- Very funny, Fletcher!

440
00:24:04.903 --> 00:24:07.572
You wanna play hardball? I'm game.

441
00:24:08.698 --> 00:24:11.409
- "You wanna play hardball? I'm game."

442
00:24:11.409 --> 00:24:14.412
- What are you doing?
What is wrong with you?

443
00:24:14.412 --> 00:24:18.708
- All rise for the Honorable
Judge, Marshall Stevens.

444
00:24:18.708 --> 00:24:20.960
- Honorable!

445
00:24:22.086 --> 00:24:23.212
- Good morning.

446
00:24:23.212 --> 00:24:27.508
Call case number BD09395.

447
00:24:27.508 --> 00:24:30.386
Samantha Cole versus Richard Cole.

448
00:24:30.386 --> 00:24:32.221
How are we doing this morning, Counsel?

449
00:24:32.221 --> 00:24:33.556
- Fine. Thank you.

450
00:24:33.556 --> 00:24:35.141
- And you, Mr. Reede?

451
00:24:35.141 --> 00:24:36.476
- I'm a little upset about a bad

452
00:24:36.476 --> 00:24:38.311
sexual episode I had last night.

453
00:24:42.357 --> 00:24:45.860
- Well, you're still young.
It'll happen more and more.

454
00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:49.405
In the meantime, what do you
say we get down to business?

455
00:24:50.448 --> 00:24:53.451
First, Mr. Reede, I
see where your client--

456
00:24:53.451 --> 00:24:55.620
- You Honor, I would like a continuance!

457
00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:57.830
- This case has already been delayed

458
00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:59.499
several times, Mr. Reede.

459
00:24:59.499 --> 00:25:00.667
- I realize that, Your Honor,

460
00:25:00.667 --> 00:25:03.628
but I would really, really,
really, like a continuance.

461
00:25:04.879 --> 00:25:07.298
- I'll have to hear a good cause, Counsel.

462
00:25:08.216 --> 00:25:09.133
What's the problem?

463
00:25:19.102 --> 00:25:22.105
-I can't lie!

464
00:25:22.105 --> 00:25:24.357
- Commendable, Mr. Reede, but I'm waiting

465
00:25:24.357 --> 00:25:27.068
to hear good cause, now,
do you have one or not?

466
00:25:27.068 --> 00:25:28.194
- Not.

467
00:25:28.194 --> 00:25:30.029
- Motion for continuance denied.

468
00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:33.282
Is there any chance of a
settlement in this case?

469
00:25:33.282 --> 00:25:34.534
- I don't think so, Your Honor,

470
00:25:34.534 --> 00:25:37.412
My client has offered
Mrs. Cole $2.4 million,

471
00:25:38.997 --> 00:25:39.998
but Mr. Reede has made it

472
00:25:39.998 --> 00:25:41.874
abundantly clear that he has no desire--

473
00:25:41.874 --> 00:25:44.585
- Settle! Settle! Settle! Settle! Settle!

474
00:25:44.585 --> 00:25:46.462
- I don't want to settle.
- You should settle.

475
00:25:46.462 --> 00:25:49.632
- Mr. Reede, you convinced me yesterday,

476
00:25:49.632 --> 00:25:52.719
I'm the victim here, I'm
starved for affection,

477
00:25:52.719 --> 00:25:54.971
I'm driven into the arms of another man.

478
00:25:54.971 --> 00:25:57.098
- Seven!
- Yeah, whatever.

479
00:25:57.098 --> 00:26:00.226
With the story you came up
with, I don't think we can lose.

480
00:26:00.226 --> 00:26:02.353
I want to proceed.

481
00:26:02.353 --> 00:26:04.564
- Mrs. Cole, you don't understand.

482
00:26:04.564 --> 00:26:07.233
- Mr. Reede. Do we have a settlement?

483
00:26:07.233 --> 00:26:08.026
- No!

484
00:26:13.364 --> 00:26:14.407
No, Your Honor.

485
00:26:14.407 --> 00:26:15.908
- There's no settlement.

486
00:26:17.118 --> 00:26:18.870
Trial to commence, 1:30 sharp.

487
00:26:38.389 --> 00:26:39.974
- It was me!

488
00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:46.272
- Hi, Mr. Reede! Like the new dress?

489
00:26:46.272 --> 00:26:48.274
- Whatever takes the focus off your head.

490
00:26:51.235 --> 00:26:52.070
- What's up, Fletcher?

491
00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:55.865
- Your cholesterol,
fatty! Dead man walking!

492
00:26:55.865 --> 00:26:56.783
- Hey Fletcher!
- Hey!

493
00:26:56.783 --> 00:26:58.284
You're not important enough to remember.

494
00:26:58.284 --> 00:26:59.577
- What's it gonna be, Mr. Reede?

495
00:26:59.577 --> 00:27:01.370
- A pockmark, eventually!

496
00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:03.748
Don't ask! For God's sakes, don't ask.

497
00:27:05.541 --> 00:27:07.585
All right. You can beat this.

498
00:27:07.585 --> 00:27:09.670
It's all a matter of willpower!

499
00:27:10.755 --> 00:27:12.215
A test.

500
00:27:12.215 --> 00:27:13.007
Something small.

501
00:27:19.889 --> 00:27:20.890
Red.

502
00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:22.141
Red.

503
00:27:22.141 --> 00:27:24.644
All right? Now, focus.

504
00:27:24.644 --> 00:27:29.524
The color of this pen is...

505
00:27:30.983 --> 00:27:35.780
The color of this pen is...

506
00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:45.581
The color of the
pen that I hold in my hand is

507
00:27:48.459 --> 00:27:49.335
royal blue!

508
00:27:54.382 --> 00:27:56.676
One lie, and I can't say it!

509
00:27:58.719 --> 00:28:00.221
I'll write it.

510
00:28:28.207 --> 00:28:31.836
Write it! Write it, or I'll break it off!

511
00:28:36.966 --> 00:28:38.426
Ah! No!

512
00:28:38.426 --> 00:28:39.218
Come on!

513
00:28:40.178 --> 00:28:41.095
Stop it.

514
00:28:51.314 --> 00:28:53.107
- Boss? What happened?

515
00:28:58.321 --> 00:29:01.824
- The pen is blue. The pen is blue.

516
00:29:01.824 --> 00:29:05.369
The goddamn pen is blue!

517
00:29:08.372 --> 00:29:10.708
- Mr. Reede, are you all right?

518
00:29:10.708 --> 00:29:12.126
- I gotta go home.

519
00:29:12.126 --> 00:29:13.794
- Home? Was the case settled?

520
00:29:13.794 --> 00:29:15.463
- No! I have to be in court at 1:30!

521
00:29:17.006 --> 00:29:18.549
- Then how are you going to go home?

522
00:29:18.549 --> 00:29:19.884
-I don't know. I don't know!

523
00:29:21.886 --> 00:29:23.346
- Okay.

524
00:29:23.346 --> 00:29:25.765
Mr. Reede, Rubin and Dunn called.

525
00:29:25.765 --> 00:29:28.684
They need to know where the
Darvis settlement offer stands.

526
00:29:28.684 --> 00:29:32.355
- I just proposed a settlement
to dick with them!

527
00:29:33.814 --> 00:29:36.234
- "Dick with them." Got it.

528
00:29:36.234 --> 00:29:39.153
And your mother called,
are you still on vacation?

529
00:29:39.153 --> 00:29:40.738
- No.

530
00:29:40.738 --> 00:29:41.572
- Then you're here?

531
00:29:41.572 --> 00:29:42.823
- Yes.

532
00:29:42.823 --> 00:29:44.825
- Thank you for clearing that up, sir.

533
00:29:44.825 --> 00:29:47.203
And your ex-wife called, she wants to know

534
00:29:47.203 --> 00:29:49.121
when you're coming to pick up your son.

535
00:29:49.121 --> 00:29:51.666
- Oh! I'm such a shit!

536
00:29:58.130 --> 00:29:58.965
- Hello.

537
00:29:58.965 --> 00:29:59.757
- Audrey?

538
00:29:59.757 --> 00:30:00.967
- Fletcher, hi, are you still

539
00:30:00.967 --> 00:30:02.343
picking Max up from school today?

540
00:30:02.343 --> 00:30:04.428
- Here's the thing. I really can't!

541
00:30:04.428 --> 00:30:06.639
I had a case I certain would settle,

542
00:30:06.639 --> 00:30:08.599
and it didn't, and I have to
go to court this afternoon.

543
00:30:08.599 --> 00:30:09.433
- Right.

544
00:30:09.433 --> 00:30:11.811
- It's true! I really wanna see Max today!

545
00:30:12.853 --> 00:30:14.563
How about that? I really do.

546
00:30:14.563 --> 00:30:16.941
- But things just keep coming
up at the last minute, right?

547
00:30:16.941 --> 00:30:18.317
- Yes, but this time it's different.

548
00:30:18.317 --> 00:30:19.986
- I see. And how is that?

549
00:30:19.986 --> 00:30:21.487
- Now I'm telling the truth.

550
00:30:21.487 --> 00:30:22.905
- And last night you weren't.
- No

551
00:30:22.905 --> 00:30:24.031
- Well, what were you doing?

552
00:30:24.031 --> 00:30:26.033
- Having sex!

553
00:30:27.159 --> 00:30:30.246
- Well, I hope that it was
with someone very special.

554
00:30:30.246 --> 00:30:31.664
- No! See, that's the thing.

555
00:30:31.664 --> 00:30:33.291
I don't even like her, but she's a partner

556
00:30:33.291 --> 00:30:35.626
and I thought I could help my
career by making her squeal.

557
00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:40.381
- Oh!

558
00:30:42.258 --> 00:30:44.135
- What's wrong with me?

559
00:30:45.177 --> 00:30:46.137
I'm getting what I deserve.

560
00:30:46.137 --> 00:30:48.306
I'm reaping what I sow. I'm--

561
00:30:58.941 --> 00:31:01.027
- Is dad still picking me up?

562
00:31:01.027 --> 00:31:02.403
- No, Max, he's not.

563
00:31:03.654 --> 00:31:05.156
I'm sorry.

564
00:31:05.156 --> 00:31:07.616
But I'm gonna pick you up,
okay. I'll work it out.

565
00:31:08.784 --> 00:31:11.078
- I guess my wish didn't come true.

566
00:31:11.078 --> 00:31:12.288
- What wish?

567
00:31:12.288 --> 00:31:15.958
- I wished that for just one
day dad couldn't tell a lie.

568
00:31:21.964 --> 00:31:22.757
- Max?

569
00:31:27.011 --> 00:31:30.306
I have something important I
wanna talk to you about, okay.

570
00:31:30.306 --> 00:31:31.432
- Okay.
- Okay.

571
00:31:40.441 --> 00:31:41.317
Hello.

572
00:31:41.317 --> 00:31:44.612
- Audrey, let me explain.
Something has happened to me.

573
00:31:44.612 --> 00:31:46.864
- Well, something else is about
to happen to you, Fletcher.

574
00:31:46.864 --> 00:31:48.532
Max and I are moving to Boston.

575
00:31:48.532 --> 00:31:49.367
- What?

576
00:31:49.367 --> 00:31:51.410
- Jerry has asked me to
marry him, and Max and I

577
00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:53.788
are going with him this
weekend to look at houses.

578
00:31:53.788 --> 00:31:55.456
- I thought it was semi-serious!

579
00:31:55.456 --> 00:31:56.749
- Yeah, well, it's just been given

580
00:31:56.749 --> 00:31:58.417
a violent shove into serious.

581
00:31:58.417 --> 00:32:00.961
- You can't move to
Boston, I'll never see Max!

582
00:32:00.961 --> 00:32:02.213
- Well, then you'll have pretty much

583
00:32:02.213 --> 00:32:04.423
the same relationship you
have with him now, won't you?

584
00:32:04.423 --> 00:32:05.257
- Where are you?

585
00:32:05.257 --> 00:32:06.300
- I'm going home.

586
00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:07.843
- When you get there, just stay there.

587
00:32:07.843 --> 00:32:09.512
I'm coming over. We have to talk.

588
00:32:09.512 --> 00:32:11.263
- Fletcher!
- I'll be right there.

589
00:32:15.101 --> 00:32:18.187
- La, la, la, la, la, la!

590
00:32:25.778 --> 00:32:27.071
- Fletcher!
- Holy hell!

591
00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:36.163
- You can run, but you can't hide.

592
00:32:41.293 --> 00:32:43.212
- What's your problem, schmuck?

593
00:32:43.212 --> 00:32:47.174
- I'm an inconsiderate prick!

594
00:33:09.738 --> 00:33:10.531
Shit!

595
00:33:16.203 --> 00:33:16.996
Shit!

596
00:33:25.588 --> 00:33:26.964
- You know why I pulled you over?

597
00:33:26.964 --> 00:33:30.426
- Depends on how long you
were following me.

598
00:33:30.426 --> 00:33:33.179
- Why don't we just take it from the top?

599
00:33:33.179 --> 00:33:34.013
- Here it goes.

600
00:33:34.013 --> 00:33:35.931
I sped, I followed too
closely, I ran a Stop sign,

601
00:33:35.931 --> 00:33:37.391
I almost hit a Chevy, I sped some more,

602
00:33:37.391 --> 00:33:38.767
I failed to yield at a crosswalk.

603
00:33:38.767 --> 00:33:40.102
I changed lanes at the intersection,

604
00:33:40.102 --> 00:33:41.437
I changed lanes without signaling

605
00:33:41.437 --> 00:33:43.355
while running a red light and speeding!

606
00:33:44.982 --> 00:33:45.983
- Is that all?

607
00:33:45.983 --> 00:33:46.775
- No.

608
00:33:49.737 --> 00:33:52.740
I have unpaid parking tickets.

609
00:33:55.493 --> 00:33:56.285
Be gentle.

610
00:34:00.247 --> 00:34:01.790
Audrey! Wait!

611
00:34:05.628 --> 00:34:07.630
Wait, Audrey. Oh!

612
00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:09.006
Hold on. Wait! Wait!

613
00:34:09.006 --> 00:34:13.344
- Wait? Wait? I just had an
insight into myself, I'm crazy.

614
00:34:13.344 --> 00:34:14.720
You call me up and say,

615
00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:17.014
"Wait, right there. I'll be right over.”

616
00:34:17.014 --> 00:34:19.600
And here's the crazy
part, I actually wait.

617
00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:20.893
- I can explain this though.

618
00:34:20.893 --> 00:34:23.729
- I have missed a department
meeting. I have...

619
00:34:23.729 --> 00:34:25.773
Did you come here in a cab?
- Yes!

620
00:34:25.773 --> 00:34:26.815
- Where's your car?

621
00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:32.446
- Thank you! I can't tell you
how much this means to me.

622
00:34:32.446 --> 00:34:36.575
-I can. $1,654.11.

623
00:34:36.575 --> 00:34:37.952
- How do you sleep at night?

624
00:34:41.622 --> 00:34:42.498
I'm taking this.

625
00:34:53.259 --> 00:34:54.927
You scratched my car!

626
00:34:56.178 --> 00:34:58.597
- Where?

627
00:34:58.597 --> 00:34:59.723
- Right there!

628
00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:01.976
- Oh, that.

629
00:35:03.686 --> 00:35:05.437
That was already there.

630
00:35:05.437 --> 00:35:07.147
- Why, you...

631
00:35:08.315 --> 00:35:09.733
You liar!

632
00:35:10.818 --> 00:35:12.611
You know what I'm gonna do about this?

633
00:35:12.611 --> 00:35:13.988
- What?
- Nothing!

634
00:35:13.988 --> 00:35:14.989
Because if I take you
to small-claims court,

635
00:35:14.989 --> 00:35:17.032
it will just drain 8 hours of my life,

636
00:35:17.032 --> 00:35:18.075
and you probably won't show up,

637
00:35:18.075 --> 00:35:19.493
and if I finally got the judgment,

638
00:35:19.493 --> 00:35:20.828
you'll just stiff me anyway,

639
00:35:20.828 --> 00:35:24.373
so what I'm gonna do, is piss
and moan like an impotent jerk

640
00:35:24.373 --> 00:35:27.960
and then bend over and
take it up the tailpipe!

641
00:35:28.919 --> 00:35:30.921
- You been here before, haven't you?

642
00:35:32.381 --> 00:35:34.592
- Well, I can't remember
when I've had more fun,

643
00:35:34.592 --> 00:35:36.927
but if you'll excuse me, I have a class.

644
00:35:36.927 --> 00:35:38.971
- Are you marrying this guy
because you're mad at me?

645
00:35:38.971 --> 00:35:41.098
- No, I divorced you
because I was mad at you.

646
00:35:41.098 --> 00:35:42.391
- Audrey, wait. I wanna talk about this!

647
00:35:42.391 --> 00:35:44.351
- Really, what do you wanna say?

648
00:35:44.351 --> 00:35:47.521
- Is this guy right for you?
I mean, he is so not me!

649
00:35:47.521 --> 00:35:49.273
- Yes! that's one of his best qualities.

650
00:35:49.273 --> 00:35:53.694
- Yeah, but he's kind of Magoo. I'm sorry.

651
00:35:53.694 --> 00:35:55.487
- You're wrong, I mean, sometimes,

652
00:35:55.487 --> 00:35:57.281
maybe yes, he is a little--

653
00:35:57.281 --> 00:35:58.115
- Magoo!

654
00:35:58.115 --> 00:36:01.327
- Yes, but since we've been
going out... Oh, my God.

655
00:36:01.327 --> 00:36:02.328
I'm not having this conversation with you.

656
00:36:02.328 --> 00:36:05.289
- Audrey, you can't go. This is not fair.

657
00:36:05.289 --> 00:36:09.209
- Fair? Oh, okay. Let's
define "fair," shall we?

658
00:36:09.209 --> 00:36:11.545
Last night a 5 year old boy was crushed,

659
00:36:11.545 --> 00:36:13.422
because his father lied to him

660
00:36:13.422 --> 00:36:16.300
about coming to his birthday party, fair?

661
00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:17.217
- Last night--

662
00:36:17.217 --> 00:36:19.011
- Was none of my business.
- Thank you.

663
00:36:19.011 --> 00:36:20.054
- None of my business.

664
00:36:20.054 --> 00:36:21.972
Two years ago, it was
my business, but see,

665
00:36:21.972 --> 00:36:23.724
I don't have to care about that anymore.

666
00:36:23.724 --> 00:36:25.601
I don't care, that's the magic of divorce,

667
00:36:25.601 --> 00:36:27.269
but it matters to Max!

668
00:36:27.269 --> 00:36:28.979
Everything you do, matters to Max,

669
00:36:28.979 --> 00:36:30.773
and everything you don't do.

670
00:36:30.773 --> 00:36:33.108
- All right, now let
me tell you something.

671
00:36:33.108 --> 00:36:34.652
I'm a bad father!

672
00:36:37.946 --> 00:36:39.406
I mean...

673
00:36:45.037 --> 00:36:46.664
I'm a bad father.

674
00:36:49.208 --> 00:36:53.712
- You're not a bad
father, when you show up.

675
00:36:53.712 --> 00:36:54.838
- What if I come over right after

676
00:36:54.838 --> 00:36:56.256
court light-out and play ball with Max?

677
00:36:56.256 --> 00:36:57.883
Then you and I can sit down and talk

678
00:36:57.883 --> 00:36:59.843
before you make any rash decisions!

679
00:36:59.843 --> 00:37:01.720
- No, we are leaving tonight.

680
00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:04.932
- Please Audrey, give me one more chance.

681
00:37:04.932 --> 00:37:07.601
I'm throwing myself on
the mercy of the court.

682
00:37:07.601 --> 00:37:11.772
I lost you, but please,
don't make me lose Max, too.

683
00:37:15.442 --> 00:37:18.946
Give me a chance to be the
father I started out to be.

684
00:37:23.534 --> 00:37:25.661
- You're really coming?

685
00:37:26.578 --> 00:37:27.996
- This is ironclad.

686
00:37:27.996 --> 00:37:31.291
This is the mother of
all promises. What time?

687
00:37:31.291 --> 00:37:33.377
- Okay, 6:00.

688
00:37:33.377 --> 00:37:35.713
- 10 to 6:00.
- All right.

689
00:37:35.713 --> 00:37:37.172
All right, all right, all right,

690
00:37:37.172 --> 00:37:40.926
but if I tell Max that you're
coming, and you don't show up,

691
00:37:40.926 --> 00:37:43.220
and I have to see that look on his face,

692
00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:44.430
that heartbreaking look,

693
00:37:46.181 --> 00:37:47.725
we're going to Boston.

694
00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.186
- If I don't show up,
I'll pack you myself.

695
00:37:51.186 --> 00:37:54.815
I will lovingly wrap your
knickknacks with bubble paper.

696
00:37:54.815 --> 00:37:55.691
- I hope so.

697
00:37:58.277 --> 00:38:00.988
Do you know what your son
was doing at 8:15 last night?

698
00:38:02.239 --> 00:38:05.451
He was making a birthday
wish, that for just one day

699
00:38:05.451 --> 00:38:07.745
his father couldn't tell a lie.

700
00:38:13.542 --> 00:38:16.795
- Oh, my God! That's it!

701
00:38:16.795 --> 00:38:19.298
- "I do not like them, Sam I Am."

702
00:38:19.298 --> 00:38:22.509
"I do not like green eggs and ham.”

703
00:38:22.509 --> 00:38:24.803
"Would you like them here or there?"

704
00:38:24.803 --> 00:38:25.971
"I would not like them--"

705
00:38:25.971 --> 00:38:26.764
- Excuse me.

706
00:38:28.056 --> 00:38:32.060
Hi. I'm Max's bad father. I'm his father.

707
00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:33.437
- Dad!

708
00:38:33.437 --> 00:38:35.606
- Could I borrow him for just one second?

709
00:38:37.149 --> 00:38:38.984
Monster Max!

710
00:38:38.984 --> 00:38:41.236
- Dadzilla! You came to play catch?

711
00:38:41.236 --> 00:38:42.571
- I'd like to, but I can't right now.

712
00:38:42.571 --> 00:38:44.281
Max, I gotta talk to you.

713
00:38:44.281 --> 00:38:45.657
Your mommy told me about that wish

714
00:38:45.657 --> 00:38:48.202
you made last night, it came true, Max.

715
00:38:48.202 --> 00:38:50.788
- Really, you mean you
have to tell the truth?

716
00:38:50.788 --> 00:38:52.247
- Yes.
- No matter what?

717
00:38:52.247 --> 00:38:53.123
- No matter what!

718
00:38:53.123 --> 00:38:54.792
- Is wrestling real?

719
00:38:54.792 --> 00:38:57.002
- In the Olympics, yes. On channel 23, no.

720
00:38:57.002 --> 00:38:59.755
- Will sitting too close to
the TV set make me go blind?

721
00:38:59.755 --> 00:39:01.215
- Not in a million years.

722
00:39:01.215 --> 00:39:04.218
- If I keep making this face,
will it get stuck that way?

723
00:39:05.177 --> 00:39:07.513
- In fact, some people make
a good living that way.

724
00:39:10.557 --> 00:39:13.393
Now listen, Max, you
gotta do something for me.

725
00:39:13.393 --> 00:39:15.604
I need you to take back that wish.

726
00:39:15.604 --> 00:39:17.773
- So you can lie?

727
00:39:17.773 --> 00:39:18.857
- Yes.

728
00:39:18.857 --> 00:39:21.193
- But not to you, you see, Max,

729
00:39:22.361 --> 00:39:27.324
sometimes grownups need to lie.

730
00:39:27.741 --> 00:39:29.743
It's hard to explain, but if...

731
00:39:31.495 --> 00:39:32.913
Look, here's a good example,

732
00:39:32.913 --> 00:39:34.414
when your mommy was pregnant with you,

733
00:39:34.414 --> 00:39:35.916
she gained a good 40 pounds,

734
00:39:35.916 --> 00:39:38.585
there was nothing she wouldn't
eat, and daddy was scared,

735
00:39:38.585 --> 00:39:39.962
but when she'd ask me, "How do I look?"

736
00:39:39.962 --> 00:39:42.005
I'd say, "Honey, you look great."

737
00:39:42.005 --> 00:39:44.299
"You're beautiful. You're glowing."

738
00:39:44.299 --> 00:39:46.301
If I had told mommy she looked like a cow,

739
00:39:46.301 --> 00:39:48.428
it would have hurt her
feelings, you understand.

740
00:39:48.428 --> 00:39:50.889
- My teacher tells me real
beauty is on the inside.

741
00:39:50.889 --> 00:39:52.850
- That's just something ugly people say.

742
00:39:54.434 --> 00:39:56.645
Max, no one can survive in the adult world

743
00:39:56.645 --> 00:39:58.313
if they have to stick to the truth.

744
00:39:58.313 --> 00:40:01.066
I could lose my case, I
could lose my promotion,

745
00:40:01.066 --> 00:40:02.651
I could even lose my job.

746
00:40:02.651 --> 00:40:04.278
Now, I need your help, Max. Okay?

747
00:40:05.737 --> 00:40:07.072
- Okay.

748
00:40:07.072 --> 00:40:11.201
- Okays, now do whatever
you did last night,

749
00:40:11.201 --> 00:40:12.411
only this time,

750
00:40:13.704 --> 00:40:15.038
make it an unwish.

751
00:40:25.007 --> 00:40:25.966
- I did it.

752
00:40:25.966 --> 00:40:29.595
- Excellent! Now, I
just need a little test.

753
00:40:49.323 --> 00:40:50.616
- Did it work?

754
00:40:50.616 --> 00:40:52.576
- Not like I'd hoped. Did you unwish it?

755
00:40:53.827 --> 00:40:56.496
- Only--
- What? Only what?

756
00:40:56.496 --> 00:40:59.833
- Yesterday, when I wished
it, I really meant it,

757
00:40:59.833 --> 00:41:01.793
this time when I unwished it,

758
00:41:01.793 --> 00:41:04.171
I only did it 'cause you told me to.

759
00:41:04.171 --> 00:41:06.673
- All right, then, do it again,

760
00:41:06.673 --> 00:41:08.550
and this time, mean it.

761
00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:09.801
- But I can't!

762
00:41:09.801 --> 00:41:11.011
- Why not?

763
00:41:11.011 --> 00:41:13.347
- 'Cause I don't want you to lie.

764
00:41:13.347 --> 00:41:18.060
- I explained this, I have
to lie, everybody lies.

765
00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:21.688
Mommy lies, even the wonderful Jerry lies.

766
00:41:21.688 --> 00:41:24.107
- But you're the only one
that makes me feel bad.

767
00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:29.738
- Max, recess is over. Come on in!

768
00:41:34.743 --> 00:41:36.703
- Mom says we're moving to Boston.

769
00:41:36.703 --> 00:41:39.331
- That isn't for sure yet.

770
00:41:40.207 --> 00:41:43.001
She promised we'd talk about
it when I come over tonight.

771
00:41:44.211 --> 00:41:47.547
I am coming! You believe
me, don't you, Max?

772
00:41:49.549 --> 00:41:51.009
I'll see you later, buddy.

773
00:42:01.603 --> 00:42:02.771
- Yo Fletcher. How's it hanging?

774
00:42:02.771 --> 00:42:04.898
- Short, shriveled and always to the left.

775
00:42:09.695 --> 00:42:13.281
- Boss, it's Skull, he
knocked over another ATM,

776
00:42:13.281 --> 00:42:17.244
this time at knife-point,
he needs your legal advice.

777
00:42:21.081 --> 00:42:24.668
- Stop breaking the law, asshole!

778
00:42:33.093 --> 00:42:35.220
- Boss, are you all right?

779
00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:36.847
- My son hates me.

780
00:42:38.598 --> 00:42:43.020
- Max loves you. I've seen
you together, you're his hero.

781
00:42:43.937 --> 00:42:44.730
- Oh, yeah?

782
00:42:46.606 --> 00:42:49.276
Last night at his birthday
party, he made a wish,

783
00:42:50.193 --> 00:42:54.072
that I wouldn't be able
to lie for one whole day.

784
00:42:54.072 --> 00:42:54.990
- Kids.

785
00:42:54.990 --> 00:42:56.825
- It came true.

786
00:42:56.825 --> 00:42:58.869
- What?
- Max's wish!

787
00:42:59.911 --> 00:43:00.954
It came true.

788
00:43:08.045 --> 00:43:11.173
- Boss, maybe you
should just take a few days off.

789
00:43:11.173 --> 00:43:13.383
- Greta, didn't
it seem weird to you

790
00:43:13.383 --> 00:43:15.719
that I kept telling the truth all morning?

791
00:43:15.719 --> 00:43:19.639
- Well, yeah, but...

792
00:43:19.639 --> 00:43:23.185
What are you saying? That
you are incapable of lying?

793
00:43:23.185 --> 00:43:26.605
- That's right! I am incapable of lying!

794
00:43:26.605 --> 00:43:27.814
- Just for today?

795
00:43:28.732 --> 00:43:30.901
- Apparently,
till 8:15 tonight.

796
00:43:30.901 --> 00:43:33.028
It's just one of those 24-hour curses.

797
00:43:33.028 --> 00:43:35.072
- Yeah, those are going around.

798
00:43:35.072 --> 00:43:36.239
- You don't believe me, do you?

799
00:43:36.239 --> 00:43:37.449
- Of course not.

800
00:43:39.076 --> 00:43:41.119
- How ironic!

801
00:43:41.119 --> 00:43:45.207
Okay, ask me something you think
I would normally lie about.

802
00:43:45.207 --> 00:43:46.625
- All right.

803
00:43:46.625 --> 00:43:48.919
Remember a couple of months
ago, when I wanted a raise?

804
00:43:48.919 --> 00:43:50.170
- Just forget it. I don't wanna do this.

805
00:43:50.170 --> 00:43:51.880
- And the company wouldn't give me one,

806
00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:54.132
and I asked if you would give it to me

807
00:43:54.132 --> 00:43:56.426
out of your own pocket, and you said

808
00:43:56.426 --> 00:43:57.719
that the company would not allow it,

809
00:43:57.719 --> 00:44:00.055
because it would create jealousy

810
00:44:00.055 --> 00:44:02.099
among the other secretaries.

811
00:44:02.099 --> 00:44:04.893
Now, was that true, or did you just

812
00:44:04.893 --> 00:44:06.436
not wanna pony up the dough?

813
00:44:09.564 --> 00:44:11.691
- Greta, please!

814
00:44:11.691 --> 00:44:13.568
Hello, Judge Stevens, hi!

815
00:44:13.568 --> 00:44:14.861
Fletcher Reede, I'm scheduled to be

816
00:44:14.861 --> 00:44:16.196
in your court in half an hour.

817
00:44:16.196 --> 00:44:19.574
Judge Stevens, I badly,
badly, need a continuance.

818
00:44:19.574 --> 00:44:22.160
Ill. Am I ill?

819
00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:24.287
That is the perfect
question for you to ask.

820
00:44:24.287 --> 00:44:25.914
Greta please lie to him for me!

821
00:44:25.914 --> 00:44:27.040
- I remember when you bought me

822
00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:31.002
this antique frame from
Tiffany's, Tiffany's?

823
00:44:31.002 --> 00:44:34.464
- Garage sale. $6.50 marked down from $10.

824
00:44:36.842 --> 00:44:38.135
I'll give you the raise!

825
00:44:39.970 --> 00:44:41.847
- Here's your raise.

826
00:44:43.431 --> 00:44:44.891
- Hi, Judge Stevens!

827
00:44:44.891 --> 00:44:46.893
Yes, I know I haven't
given you an answer yet,

828
00:44:46.893 --> 00:44:49.938
but, illness could mean so many things.

829
00:44:49.938 --> 00:44:53.108
Can you hold? Hello? Mom!

830
00:44:53.108 --> 00:44:53.900
Hi!

831
00:44:54.985 --> 00:44:57.028
I wasn't really on vacation,

832
00:44:57.028 --> 00:44:59.489
‘cause I didn't wanna talk to you!

833
00:44:59.489 --> 00:45:00.907
Because you insist on talking to me

834
00:45:00.907 --> 00:45:03.451
about Dad's bowel movements,
size, color, frequency.

835
00:45:03.451 --> 00:45:05.078
I'll call you later! Hello?

836
00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:11.668
Oh! Damn it! I cut him
off. I cut off the judge!

837
00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:19.176
Greta! Don't leave!

838
00:45:19.176 --> 00:45:21.261
I'm on my knees in a $900 suit!

839
00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:27.100
- Mr. Reede, several years
ago, a friend of mine

840
00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:29.019
had a burglar on her roof, a burglar.

841
00:45:29.019 --> 00:45:30.770
He fell through the kitchen skylight,

842
00:45:30.770 --> 00:45:32.105
landed on a cutting board,

843
00:45:32.105 --> 00:45:34.065
on a butcher's knife, cutting his leg.

844
00:45:34.065 --> 00:45:37.360
The burglar sued my
friend. He sued my friend!

845
00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:39.863
And because of guys like you, he won!

846
00:45:39.863 --> 00:45:44.284
My friend had to pay the
burglar $6,000. Is that justice?

847
00:45:44.284 --> 00:45:45.076
- No.

848
00:45:46.328 --> 00:45:47.537
I'd have got him $10,000.

849
00:45:49.122 --> 00:45:50.290
- Good-bye, Mr. Reede.

850
00:45:50.290 --> 00:45:52.667
- No! No! No! Wait! I didn't
understand the question!

851
00:45:52.667 --> 00:45:53.919
Ask me again! Ask me again!

852
00:45:53.919 --> 00:45:55.378
- Have a nice day in court.

853
00:45:55.378 --> 00:45:56.171
- Greta!

854
00:45:58.048 --> 00:45:59.549
- Hi.
- God in heaven!

855
00:46:00.884 --> 00:46:03.428
- It's nice to see you too
Fletcher. Are you busy?

856
00:46:03.428 --> 00:46:04.429
- Extremely.

857
00:46:04.429 --> 00:46:06.556
- Good. Would you follow me, please?

858
00:46:11.102 --> 00:46:12.896
Did you know that the
partnership committee

859
00:46:12.896 --> 00:46:15.398
is being headed up be Mr. Allan himself?

860
00:46:15.398 --> 00:46:18.193
You used to work directly
for Mr. Allan, didn't you?

861
00:46:18.193 --> 00:46:19.027
- Yeah!

862
00:46:19.027 --> 00:46:20.737
- Tell me,

863
00:46:20.737 --> 00:46:21.863
what do you think of him?

864
00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:25.909
- He's a pedantic, pontificating,
pretentious bastard!

865
00:46:25.909 --> 00:46:27.869
A belligerent old fart,
a worthless steaming

866
00:46:27.869 --> 00:46:31.122
pile of cow dung, figuratively speaking.

867
00:46:31.122 --> 00:46:34.167
- Really? How delightful. This way.

868
00:46:36.211 --> 00:46:38.797
Pardon me for interrupting your meeting.

869
00:46:38.797 --> 00:46:40.882
Mr. Allan, you remember Fletcher Reede?

870
00:46:41.925 --> 00:46:45.011
- Oh, yes, yes. Nice to
see you again, Fletcher.

871
00:46:45.011 --> 00:46:48.014
By the way, I'll be observing
you in court this afternoon.

872
00:46:48.014 --> 00:46:50.517
I've been hearing some good
things about you.

873
00:46:50.517 --> 00:46:53.728
- Well, Fletcher has been telling me

874
00:46:53.728 --> 00:46:56.064
how much he thinks of you.

875
00:46:56.064 --> 00:46:58.191
Oh, why don't you tell Mr. Allan.

876
00:46:58.191 --> 00:47:00.735
Well, what do you think of him?

877
00:47:07.826 --> 00:47:11.246
- He's a pedantic, pontificating,
pretentious bastard.

878
00:47:11.246 --> 00:47:13.290
A belligerent old fart, a worthless

879
00:47:13.290 --> 00:47:17.085
steaming pile of cow dung.

880
00:47:18.003 --> 00:47:20.463
Figuratively speaking.

881
00:47:40.650 --> 00:47:43.445
- That's the funniest damn
thing I've ever heard!

882
00:47:43.445 --> 00:47:47.824
You're a real card, Reede!
I love a good roast!

883
00:47:49.409 --> 00:47:50.285
Do Simmons!

884
00:47:51.619 --> 00:47:53.038
- Simmons is old!

885
00:47:55.248 --> 00:47:56.833
He should've been out
of the game years ago,

886
00:47:56.833 --> 00:47:58.835
but he can't stay home
'cause he hates his wife.

887
00:48:01.629 --> 00:48:03.173
You've met her at the Christmas parties,

888
00:48:03.173 --> 00:48:05.842
she's the one that gets
plastered and calls him a retard.

889
00:48:06.718 --> 00:48:11.014
And you, Tom, you're the biggest
brown nose I've ever seen!

890
00:48:11.014 --> 00:48:13.141
You've got your head so
far up Mr. Allan's ass,

891
00:48:13.141 --> 00:48:15.685
I can't tell where you end and he begins!

892
00:48:15.685 --> 00:48:18.104
- Priceless!

893
00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:22.984
- You have bad breath
caused by gingivitis.

894
00:48:22.984 --> 00:48:24.652
You couldn't get a porn star off.

895
00:48:24.652 --> 00:48:25.987
Your hairpiece looks like something

896
00:48:25.987 --> 00:48:27.489
that killed crossing the highway.

897
00:48:27.489 --> 00:48:28.740
I don't know whether to comb it

898
00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:31.618
or scrape it off with a
shovel and bury it in lime!

899
00:48:33.078 --> 00:48:34.287
Loser!

900
00:48:34.287 --> 00:48:35.288
Idiot!

901
00:48:35.288 --> 00:48:36.206
Wimp!

902
00:48:36.206 --> 00:48:37.415
Degenerate!

903
00:48:37.415 --> 00:48:39.042
Slut!

904
00:48:41.211 --> 00:48:43.880
- I like your style, Reede!

905
00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:45.965
That's just what this
stuffy company needs!

906
00:48:45.965 --> 00:48:47.717
A little irreverence!

907
00:48:47.717 --> 00:48:50.095
- Good! I'll see you later, dickhead!

908
00:48:51.888 --> 00:48:53.640
- Dickhead! Priceless!

909
00:49:10.615 --> 00:49:13.743
- Oh! Keep your eye on that boy.

910
00:49:13.743 --> 00:49:15.120
Dickhead!

911
00:49:36.141 --> 00:49:39.394
- Third District
Court is now in session.

912
00:49:39.394 --> 00:49:42.981
The Honorable Judge
Marshall Stevens presiding.

913
00:49:44.816 --> 00:49:49.195
- Afternoon, Counselors.
Are we ready to begin?

914
00:49:49.195 --> 00:49:50.029
- No, sir!

915
00:49:50.029 --> 00:49:51.406
We are not ready to begin,

916
00:49:51.406 --> 00:49:53.908
because my client has not arrived!

917
00:49:53.908 --> 00:49:55.910
- Hurry up! Move it! Move it!

918
00:49:58.830 --> 00:49:59.956
- Mr. Reede!

919
00:49:59.956 --> 00:50:01.207
- Sorry, Your Honor.

920
00:50:01.207 --> 00:50:03.960
- Go, go, go. and Lupe,
you keep those kids quiet.

921
00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:06.171
I'm not even close to kidding.

922
00:50:06.171 --> 00:50:09.549
Sorry. Billy threw up in the car.

923
00:50:09.549 --> 00:50:12.218
- You brought your kids to your divorce?

924
00:50:12.218 --> 00:50:13.803
- Sympathy.
- Well, it's working.

925
00:50:13.803 --> 00:50:16.431
I feel sorry for them already.

926
00:50:16.431 --> 00:50:19.392
- Miss Appleton, you may begin.

927
00:50:19.392 --> 00:50:21.853
From March 6 through June 12,

928
00:50:21.853 --> 00:50:25.607
I surveilled Mrs. Cole at
the behest of Mr. Cole.

929
00:50:25.607 --> 00:50:27.650
During that period, I noted that Mr. Cole

930
00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:31.529
left each day between 7:40 and 7:50.

931
00:50:31.529 --> 00:50:34.616
Thereafter Mrs. Cole would frequently have

932
00:50:34.616 --> 00:50:39.329
a male visitor arrive and
stay from one to four hours.

933
00:50:39.329 --> 00:50:44.125
I was able to take several
photographs of the male visitor.

934
00:50:44.125 --> 00:50:45.168
- I see.

935
00:50:46.878 --> 00:50:50.131
Do you know what Mrs.
Cole and her male visitor

936
00:50:50.131 --> 00:50:54.177
did during these frequent visits?

937
00:50:54.177 --> 00:50:56.971
- Well, they were good about
keeping the shades drawn,

938
00:50:56.971 --> 00:51:01.267
but I was able to make a
recording of one such session.

939
00:51:03.102 --> 00:51:05.313
- Your Honor, as you are aware,

940
00:51:05.313 --> 00:51:07.357
under the terms of the
prenuptial agreement,

941
00:51:07.357 --> 00:51:11.361
if Mrs. Cole commits adultery,
she is entitled to nothing.

942
00:51:12.237 --> 00:51:14.197
With your permission, we'd like to play

943
00:51:14.197 --> 00:51:15.865
the following tape recording.

944
00:51:18.159 --> 00:51:19.577
- Oh yeah.

945
00:51:19.577 --> 00:51:22.914
- Its that good to
you baby. Here comes Big Daddy!

946
00:51:22.914 --> 00:51:24.374
- Oh, God!

947
00:51:24.374 --> 00:51:26.751
Oh! Do it to me! Do it to me!

948
00:51:27.877 --> 00:51:32.840
Harder! Harder!

949
00:51:35.969 --> 00:51:37.095
- Oh! Come on!

950
00:51:38.137 --> 00:51:40.974
Your Honor, how can it be
proved that the male voice

951
00:51:40.974 --> 00:51:43.351
on that tape is not Mr. Cole himself?

952
00:51:43.351 --> 00:51:47.730
- You are such a better lover
than my husband! Oh, my God!

953
00:51:47.730 --> 00:51:49.607
- Your Honor, I object!

954
00:51:49.607 --> 00:51:51.276
- And why is that, Mr. Reede?

955
00:51:51.276 --> 00:51:53.278
- Because it's devastating to my case!

956
00:51:53.278 --> 00:51:54.279
- Overruled.

957
00:51:54.279 --> 00:51:55.405
- Good call!

958
00:51:56.656 --> 00:51:58.992
- I gotta go. I still
haven't cleaned your pool.

959
00:51:58.992 --> 00:52:00.076
- Your witness.

960
00:52:00.076 --> 00:52:03.288
- All right.

961
00:52:03.288 --> 00:52:05.790
- Well, Mr. Reede, you may proceed.

962
00:52:11.546 --> 00:52:12.338
- How?

963
00:52:37.864 --> 00:52:39.157
Your Honor, would the court be willing

964
00:52:39.157 --> 00:52:41.200
to grant me a short bathroom break?

965
00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:42.702
- Can't it wait?

966
00:52:42.702 --> 00:52:43.494
- Yes, it can.

967
00:52:44.621 --> 00:52:45.538
But I've heard that if you hold it,

968
00:52:45.538 --> 00:52:47.707
you can damage the prostate
gland, making it very difficult

969
00:52:47.707 --> 00:52:50.710
to get an erection or even become aroused!

970
00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:52.045
- Is that true?

971
00:52:52.045 --> 00:52:52.879
- It has to be.

972
00:52:54.589 --> 00:52:56.799
- In that case, I better
take a little break myself.

973
00:52:56.799 --> 00:52:59.302
But you get back here immediately
so we can finish this.

974
00:53:15.985 --> 00:53:18.946
- How am I going to get out of this?

975
00:53:22.367 --> 00:53:23.660
Think.

976
00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:24.452
Think.

977
00:53:25.370 --> 00:53:26.162
Think!

978
00:54:25.346 --> 00:54:27.181
- What the hell are you doing?

979
00:54:28.641 --> 00:54:31.352
- I'm kicking my ass!

980
00:54:31.352 --> 00:54:32.145
Do you mind?

981
00:54:58.087 --> 00:55:00.339
- I found him like this in
the bathroom, Your Honor.

982
00:55:00.339 --> 00:55:02.508
Somebody beat the hell out of him.

983
00:55:02.508 --> 00:55:03.468
- Who did this?

984
00:55:03.468 --> 00:55:05.887
- A madman, Your Honor!

985
00:55:05.887 --> 00:55:08.890
A desperate fool at the
end of his pitiful rope!

986
00:55:08.890 --> 00:55:10.391
- What did he look like?

987
00:55:10.391 --> 00:55:14.645
- About 6'2", 180 pounds,
big teeth, kind of gangly.

988
00:55:14.645 --> 00:55:16.731
- Bailiff, have the deputy
search the building.

989
00:55:16.731 --> 00:55:17.565
- Yes, sir.

990
00:55:19.442 --> 00:55:20.777
- Order!

991
00:55:20.777 --> 00:55:21.861
Order!

992
00:55:26.824 --> 00:55:27.950
Under the circumstances,

993
00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:30.286
I have no choice but to recess this case

994
00:55:30.286 --> 00:55:33.164
until 9:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.

995
00:55:33.164 --> 00:55:36.125
Unless, of course, you
feel you can still proceed.

996
00:55:40.254 --> 00:55:41.714
Can you?

997
00:55:47.011 --> 00:55:47.804
- Yes,

998
00:55:49.138 --> 00:55:49.931
I can.

999
00:55:51.641 --> 00:55:53.434
- I admire your courage, Mr. Reede.

1000
00:55:54.644 --> 00:55:57.688
We'll take a short recess so
that you can compose yourself,

1001
00:55:57.688 --> 00:55:59.023
and then we'll get started.

1002
00:56:09.116 --> 00:56:10.618
- Here you go.

1003
00:56:23.631 --> 00:56:24.799
- Hello?

1004
00:56:24.799 --> 00:56:25.675
- Dad?

1005
00:56:25.675 --> 00:56:27.343
- Max?

1006
00:56:27.343 --> 00:56:28.302
How's it going?

1007
00:56:28.302 --> 00:56:31.222
- Great, you know Paul and
Emanuel from across the street?

1008
00:56:31.222 --> 00:56:32.056
- Yeah.

1009
00:56:32.056 --> 00:56:35.017
- Well, they never wanna
play baseball with me,

1010
00:56:35.017 --> 00:56:37.270
but I told them I'm playing
tonight with my dad.

1011
00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:39.730
So now they wanna play
with us. Is that okay?

1012
00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:42.650
- Sure. The more the merrier.

1013
00:56:42.650 --> 00:56:45.236
- Coolest! Do you wanna be Jose Canseco?

1014
00:56:45.236 --> 00:56:46.863
- Oh, yeah.

1015
00:56:46.863 --> 00:56:49.615
Who else is gonna hit
that famous Nomo slider?

1016
00:56:49.615 --> 00:56:50.408
- Mr. Reede.

1017
00:56:51.826 --> 00:56:53.578
- I gotta go now, Max.

1018
00:56:53.578 --> 00:56:56.372
I'll see you in a couple of
hours, okay, all right, bye.

1019
00:56:56.372 --> 00:56:57.164
- Bye, dad.

1020
00:56:59.250 --> 00:57:02.628
He's really coming! He's really
coming! I'm gonna go change.

1021
00:57:02.628 --> 00:57:03.713
- Okay, go ahead!

1022
00:57:03.713 --> 00:57:04.505
- Yeah!

1023
00:57:09.552 --> 00:57:10.511
- Mr. Reede!

1024
00:57:11.637 --> 00:57:12.847
- "Mr. Reede! Mr. Reede!"

1025
00:57:16.392 --> 00:57:18.102
- This is my lawyer,
he's a little unorthodox,

1026
00:57:18.102 --> 00:57:19.979
you'll get used to him.

1027
00:57:21.397 --> 00:57:24.275
Mr. Reede, you remember Kenneth
Falk, the man from the tape.

1028
00:57:24.275 --> 00:57:25.151
- How could I forget?

1029
00:57:25.151 --> 00:57:27.028
- Hey, how you doing?

1030
00:57:27.028 --> 00:57:30.114
- I've slipped into the seventh
circle of hell, thank you.

1031
00:57:30.114 --> 00:57:33.367
- Shouldn't we be going over
our testimony right now?

1032
00:57:33.367 --> 00:57:36.329
- Basically, the plan is, I
walk you through the tape.

1033
00:57:36.329 --> 00:57:38.456
Step by step, I ask you questions--

1034
00:57:38.456 --> 00:57:41.417
- Right, and we give the
explanation you came up with.

1035
00:57:41.417 --> 00:57:42.293
- Exactly.

1036
00:57:42.293 --> 00:57:44.629
- So all we are gonna do
is lie. That sounds simple.

1037
00:57:44.629 --> 00:57:45.421
- Doesn't it!

1038
00:57:46.881 --> 00:57:49.133
Then I'll finish up with a
dramatic series of questions.

1039
00:57:49.133 --> 00:57:53.596
Something like, Mr. Falk, isn't it true

1040
00:57:53.596 --> 00:57:57.975
that you and Mrs. Cole have
never made...

1041
00:58:06.525 --> 00:58:07.944
I can'tdo it.

1042
00:58:07.944 --> 00:58:12.740
I can't finish the question
if I know the answer is a lie.

1043
00:58:27.672 --> 00:58:29.382
- You may proceed, Mr. Reede.

1044
00:58:43.312 --> 00:58:44.605
- Respondent calls,

1045
00:58:47.316 --> 00:58:48.484
Kenneth Falk.

1046
00:59:06.585 --> 00:59:08.379
- Raise your right hand.

1047
00:59:08.379 --> 00:59:09.922
Do you swear to tell the
truth, the whole truth,

1048
00:59:09.922 --> 00:59:11.674
and nothing but the
truth, so help you God?

1049
00:59:11.674 --> 00:59:12.466
-I do!

1050
00:59:13.551 --> 00:59:14.385
I mean...

1051
00:59:18.222 --> 00:59:19.015
- I do.

1052
00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:27.356
- Mr. Falk.

1053
00:59:32.945 --> 00:59:34.739
Do you know my client, Samantha Cole?

1054
00:59:35.865 --> 00:59:36.657
- Yes.

1055
00:59:40.369 --> 00:59:42.204
Isn't it true that your relationship

1056
00:59:42.204 --> 00:59:44.957
with my client is entirely platonic?

1057
00:59:44.957 --> 00:59:47.418
I object, Your Honor!

1058
00:59:47.418 --> 00:59:48.419
- To yourself?

1059
00:59:50.129 --> 00:59:55.092
- Yeah, but I would like
to rephrase the question.

1060
00:59:58.512 --> 01:00:02.349
Mr. Falk, would I be
accurate if I described

1061
01:00:02.349 --> 01:00:05.853
your relationship with Mrs.
Cole as totally professional?

1062
01:00:05.853 --> 01:00:08.064
I object, and I move to strike!

1063
01:00:09.231 --> 01:00:11.984
- Mr. Reede, I don't know what you're on,

1064
01:00:11.984 --> 01:00:14.361
but you better get to
the point, and quick.

1065
01:00:16.739 --> 01:00:17.531
- Thank you, sir.

1066
01:00:22.369 --> 01:00:24.538
Is your relationship with
my client entirely platonic?

1067
01:00:24.538 --> 01:00:27.374
Not! Is not your relationship
with my client...

1068
01:00:28.584 --> 01:00:29.502
Bad baby, bad baby!

1069
01:00:30.461 --> 01:00:34.882
Did you ever not make
lo... Did you...

1070
01:00:34.882 --> 01:00:35.758
- Mr. Reede!

1071
01:00:35.758 --> 01:00:38.719
- You had sex with her every
time you met, didn't you? Liar!

1072
01:00:40.096 --> 01:00:41.680
- He's badgering the witness.

1073
01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:42.515
- It's his witness.

1074
01:00:42.515 --> 01:00:44.016
- You slammed her! You dunked her donuts!

1075
01:00:44.016 --> 01:00:45.226
You gave her dog a Snausage!

1076
01:00:45.226 --> 01:00:47.978
You stuffed her like
a Thanksgiving turkey!

1077
01:00:50.689 --> 01:00:53.109
- All right! All right, it's true! Okay!

1078
01:00:53.109 --> 01:00:55.444
I humped her brains out!
There, now you happy?

1079
01:01:02.076 --> 01:01:04.745
- No further questions.

1080
01:01:23.305 --> 01:01:24.098
- No questions.

1081
01:01:26.725 --> 01:01:27.685
- You may step down.

1082
01:01:32.565 --> 01:01:35.734
Do I dare ask you to
call your next witness?

1083
01:01:39.321 --> 01:01:42.241
- I have no further witnesses, Your Honor.

1084
01:01:42.241 --> 01:01:44.785
- What are you doing? Call me!

1085
01:01:44.785 --> 01:01:48.372
- You do not understand. I can't lie.

1086
01:01:48.372 --> 01:01:51.458
I can't do anything
dishonest until 8:15 tonight!

1087
01:01:51.458 --> 01:01:54.670
- Listen, you bastard! I want my money!

1088
01:01:54.670 --> 01:01:57.882
I am not going to end up a 31
year old divorcée on welfare,

1089
01:01:57.882 --> 01:01:59.466
because my scumbag attorney

1090
01:01:59.466 --> 01:02:01.343
had a sudden attack of conscience!

1091
01:02:02.845 --> 01:02:03.679
- 31?

1092
01:02:04.638 --> 01:02:07.016
- If Mr. Reede has no further witnesses,

1093
01:02:07.016 --> 01:02:10.352
then I have no choice
but to rule in favor of--

1094
01:02:10.352 --> 01:02:11.520
- Your Honor!

1095
01:02:14.273 --> 01:02:17.109
I call Samantha Cole to the stand.

1096
01:02:19.528 --> 01:02:21.280
- Order.

1097
01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:23.365
Order!

1098
01:02:23.365 --> 01:02:25.075
Order!
- Knock it off!

1099
01:02:25.075 --> 01:02:25.951
- Sit down!

1100
01:02:28.454 --> 01:02:31.081
Mr. Reede, it is out of
sheer morbid curiosity

1101
01:02:31.081 --> 01:02:33.626
I'm allowing this freak show to continue.

1102
01:02:37.004 --> 01:02:37.796
Mrs. Cole,

1103
01:02:39.006 --> 01:02:39.924
if you dare.

1104
01:02:55.481 --> 01:02:56.690
- Mrs. Cole,

1105
01:02:58.108 --> 01:03:01.695
is this a copy of your driver's license?

1106
01:03:03.572 --> 01:03:05.157
- Yes.

1107
01:03:05.157 --> 01:03:06.700
- It says here you're a blonde. Are you?

1108
01:03:07.743 --> 01:03:09.995
If you don't remember,
perhaps Mr. Falk will.

1109
01:03:09.995 --> 01:03:10.913
- Brunette.

1110
01:03:10.913 --> 01:03:12.665
- We could play the tape
again, maybe it's on there.

1111
01:03:12.665 --> 01:03:14.291
- I'm a brunette!

1112
01:03:15.626 --> 01:03:18.045
- Thank you. Now, let's see.

1113
01:03:18.045 --> 01:03:19.922
"Weight, 105?"

1114
01:03:19.922 --> 01:03:22.007
Yeah! In your bra.

1115
01:03:22.007 --> 01:03:23.175
- Your Honor, I object!

1116
01:03:23.175 --> 01:03:24.051
- You would!

1117
01:03:24.051 --> 01:03:25.094
- Bastard!
- Hag!

1118
01:03:25.094 --> 01:03:27.888
- Quiet! Overruled! Weight?

1119
01:03:29.974 --> 01:03:30.766
- 118.

1120
01:03:32.059 --> 01:03:34.770
All right, fine, fine. I'm 127.

1121
01:03:35.938 --> 01:03:37.940
- And it says here you were born in 1964,

1122
01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:40.609
but that's not true either, is it?

1123
01:03:40.609 --> 01:03:42.403
- Is it?
- No.

1124
01:03:42.403 --> 01:03:43.570
- Can you tell me what it says here

1125
01:03:43.570 --> 01:03:46.448
on your birth certificate
under "Date of Birth."

1126
01:03:46.448 --> 01:03:47.533
- Your Honor, I object.

1127
01:03:47.533 --> 01:03:49.159
What does this have to do with anything?

1128
01:03:49.159 --> 01:03:51.912
- Overruled. Mrs. Cole,
answer the question.

1129
01:03:53.622 --> 01:03:54.415
- "1965."

1130
01:03:56.458 --> 01:03:57.960
- Now let me get this straight.

1131
01:03:59.003 --> 01:04:01.922
That would mean that
you lied about your age

1132
01:04:01.922 --> 01:04:03.924
to make yourself older.

1133
01:04:03.924 --> 01:04:07.219
But why would any woman wanna do that?

1134
01:04:08.345 --> 01:04:10.889
- I changed it so I could get married.

1135
01:04:10.889 --> 01:04:14.935
- And the truth shall set you free!

1136
01:04:16.228 --> 01:04:18.147
My client lied about her age!

1137
01:04:18.147 --> 01:04:20.065
She was only 17 when she got married,

1138
01:04:20.065 --> 01:04:21.859
which makes her a minor,

1139
01:04:21.859 --> 01:04:23.569
and in the great state of California,

1140
01:04:23.569 --> 01:04:26.196
no minor can enter into
any legal contract,

1141
01:04:26.196 --> 01:04:29.116
without parental consent, including...

1142
01:04:29.116 --> 01:04:30.409
- Prenuptial agreements.

1143
01:04:30.409 --> 01:04:33.996
- Prenuptial agreements!
This contract is void!

1144
01:04:33.996 --> 01:04:35.331
The fact that my client has been ridden

1145
01:04:35.331 --> 01:04:37.750
more than Seattle Slew is irrelevant.

1146
01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:39.501
Standard community property applies

1147
01:04:39.501 --> 01:04:41.587
and she is entitled half
of the marital assets

1148
01:04:41.587 --> 01:04:43.547
or $11.395 million!

1149
01:04:44.548 --> 01:04:47.760
Jordan fades back. And that's the game!

1150
01:04:49.219 --> 01:04:51.930
Nothing further, Your Honor.

1151
01:04:58.729 --> 01:05:00.147
- Order.

1152
01:05:00.147 --> 01:05:01.774
Order.

1153
01:05:01.774 --> 01:05:02.566
Order!

1154
01:05:05.819 --> 01:05:07.404
In light of this new evidence,

1155
01:05:07.404 --> 01:05:10.115
the court must rule in favor of Mrs. Cole.

1156
01:05:10.115 --> 01:05:13.869
She is hereby awarded
half the marital assets.

1157
01:05:15.788 --> 01:05:18.290
- The son of a bitch
pulled it off!

1158
01:05:18.290 --> 01:05:19.875
- I didn't know she was under age!

1159
01:05:19.875 --> 01:05:22.127
- It doesn't matter.
The contract's void.

1160
01:05:23.003 --> 01:05:26.256
- Order. Order.

1161
01:05:27.341 --> 01:05:29.510
I understand both parties have agreed

1162
01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:31.470
to joint custody, is that correct?

1163
01:05:31.470 --> 01:05:32.763
- Yes.
- Yes.

1164
01:05:32.763 --> 01:05:35.808
- No. I'm contesting custody.

1165
01:05:35.808 --> 01:05:36.642
- What?

1166
01:05:36.642 --> 01:05:37.976
- If I get sole custody of the kids,

1167
01:05:37.976 --> 01:05:40.979
that's another $10,000 in
child support payments.

1168
01:05:40.979 --> 01:05:42.898
- You just won $11 million!

1169
01:05:42.898 --> 01:05:45.984
- Hey, I'm the victim
here, you said it yourself.

1170
01:05:45.984 --> 01:05:47.820
Now I'm gonna hit him where it hurts.

1171
01:05:49.822 --> 01:05:50.614
- But you...

1172
01:05:51.657 --> 01:05:54.451
You said he was a good father.

1173
01:05:54.451 --> 01:05:55.244
- So?

1174
01:05:58.372 --> 01:06:00.207
- Well, Mr. Reede,

1175
01:06:00.207 --> 01:06:03.085
do we have an agreement on custody or not?

1176
01:06:06.755 --> 01:06:07.548
- No.

1177
01:06:08.882 --> 01:06:09.675
- I see.

1178
01:06:11.135 --> 01:06:12.344
In that case, there will be

1179
01:06:12.344 --> 01:06:16.390
a custody hearing, on
the 19th at 9:00 a.m.

1180
01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:17.891
Court is adjourned.

1181
01:06:25.816 --> 01:06:27.359
- Come on, let's go.
- Daddy!

1182
01:06:27.359 --> 01:06:29.319
- You stop whining, or I'll give you

1183
01:06:29.319 --> 01:06:30.362
something to whine about!

1184
01:06:30.362 --> 01:06:32.865
- I wanna go with daddy!

1185
01:06:32.865 --> 01:06:34.199
- Oh, come here, kids, come on.

1186
01:06:34.199 --> 01:06:36.201
It's all right. Don't you worry.

1187
01:06:36.201 --> 01:06:39.913
I promise we'll be together,
whatever I have to do.

1188
01:06:39.913 --> 01:06:41.623
It's okay. It's okay.

1189
01:06:41.623 --> 01:06:44.626
- Oh, for God's sake, will you
give me those? They're mine!

1190
01:06:44.626 --> 01:06:47.546
Let go of daddy! Let go
of him! Let go of daddy!

1191
01:06:47.546 --> 01:06:50.841
We're leaving now! Lupe, come on!

1192
01:06:50.841 --> 01:06:52.968
Don't you have some checks to write?

1193
01:06:52.968 --> 01:06:55.179
You haven't paid for them yet.

1194
01:07:06.982 --> 01:07:10.027
- I love children.

1195
01:07:10.027 --> 01:07:12.821
They give you so much
leverage in a case like this.

1196
01:07:12.821 --> 01:07:17.367
You did an incredible
job, partner.

1197
01:07:19.119 --> 01:07:23.040
Look at him. He's stunned,
he can't believe it.

1198
01:07:25.167 --> 01:07:28.378
- Your Honor, may I
please approach the bench?

1199
01:07:28.378 --> 01:07:30.339
- We're adjourned, Mr. Reede.

1200
01:07:30.339 --> 01:07:33.967
- Your Honor, I think
we've made a big mistake.

1201
01:07:33.967 --> 01:07:36.762
- Mr. Reede, I am tired and very cranky.

1202
01:07:36.762 --> 01:07:40.516
- I know, but this is
just wrong, isn't it?

1203
01:07:40.516 --> 01:07:43.685
I manipulated the system,
just because you bought it

1204
01:07:43.685 --> 01:07:45.812
doesn't mean I'm right,
it's a technicality!

1205
01:07:46.813 --> 01:07:49.775
- Young man, having my judgment
mocked in my own court,

1206
01:07:49.775 --> 01:07:52.653
is not something I'm prepared to tolerate!

1207
01:07:52.653 --> 01:07:54.029
- Well, maybe you can
tell that to the kids

1208
01:07:54.029 --> 01:07:56.782
when they're adopted by the Manson family!

1209
01:07:56.782 --> 01:07:59.159
- One more word out of you, Mr. Reede,

1210
01:07:59.159 --> 01:08:00.911
and I'll hold you in contempt!

1211
01:08:00.911 --> 01:08:04.498
- I hold myself in contempt!

1212
01:08:04.498 --> 01:08:06.375
Why should you be any different?

1213
01:08:06.375 --> 01:08:07.709
- Bailiff, take him away!

1214
01:08:07.709 --> 01:08:11.547
- This man is a good father,
and children are not leverage!

1215
01:08:11.547 --> 01:08:12.965
Oh, no, don't do this!

1216
01:08:12.965 --> 01:08:16.009
I have a date to play ball with my son!

1217
01:08:16.009 --> 01:08:19.263
I can't be late! It's my last chance!

1218
01:08:19.263 --> 01:08:20.639
I'm Jose Canseco!

1219
01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:23.016
I'm Jose Canseco!

1220
01:08:28.897 --> 01:08:30.190
Phone call! Phone call!

1221
01:08:30.190 --> 01:08:35.153
I get a phone call! I get a
phone call! I get a phone call!

1222
01:08:37.531 --> 01:08:38.448
- Hello?

1223
01:08:38.448 --> 01:08:39.283
- Audrey, it's me.

1224
01:08:39.283 --> 01:08:40.701
For the love of God, don't hang up!

1225
01:08:40.701 --> 01:08:41.994
- I can't talk to you right now.

1226
01:08:41.994 --> 01:08:43.245
Our flight leaves at 8:00.

1227
01:08:43.245 --> 01:08:44.329
- What?

1228
01:08:44.329 --> 01:08:45.622
- I'm taking Max someplace

1229
01:08:45.622 --> 01:08:47.583
where you can't do this to him anymore.

1230
01:08:47.583 --> 01:08:50.294
- Audrey, wait! The most amazing
thing has happened to me.

1231
01:08:50.294 --> 01:08:51.420
I swear, I'm a changed man!

1232
01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:55.007
Just come to the courthouse
with $1,000 and bail me out.

1233
01:08:56.675 --> 01:08:58.385
Hello? Hello!

1234
01:08:58.385 --> 01:08:59.219
- Time's up, pal.

1235
01:08:59.219 --> 01:09:01.763
- No, just one more
call. Just one more call.

1236
01:09:05.475 --> 01:09:07.644
- Okay. Let's go.

1237
01:09:09.146 --> 01:09:09.980
You ready?

1238
01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:10.814
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1239
01:09:10.814 --> 01:09:12.441
Will you get the door, please?

1240
01:09:12.441 --> 01:09:13.233
- Okay.

1241
01:09:14.401 --> 01:09:15.193
- Thank you.

1242
01:09:16.361 --> 01:09:17.195
- Mr. Reede,

1243
01:09:18.822 --> 01:09:19.615
you made bail.

1244
01:09:20.532 --> 01:09:21.700
- Greta!

1245
01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:23.327
Oh! Thank God!

1246
01:09:23.327 --> 01:09:26.121
- Am I too late? Have you
been sexually molested yet?

1247
01:09:26.121 --> 01:09:27.956
Because I could circle the block.

1248
01:09:30.584 --> 01:09:31.501
- How did you know I was here?

1249
01:09:31.501 --> 01:09:33.795
- One of the other
secretaries called me at home,

1250
01:09:33.795 --> 01:09:36.381
said you went all noble
in front of Mr. Allan.

1251
01:09:36.381 --> 01:09:39.092
- Yeah, I think I'm
fired. Isn't that great?

1252
01:09:39.092 --> 01:09:41.595
Maybe I'll start my own
firm. Do you need a job?

1253
01:09:41.595 --> 01:09:43.305
- I don't think you can afford me.

1254
01:09:48.268 --> 01:09:49.686
- Oh man, I got to get my car.

1255
01:09:49.686 --> 01:09:50.812
Audrey's on her way to the airport.

1256
01:09:50.812 --> 01:09:52.022
I could lose Max forever.

1257
01:09:52.022 --> 01:09:53.940
I can't let that happen. I love him!

1258
01:09:54.816 --> 01:09:57.027
You know, this truth stuff is pretty cool.

1259
01:09:57.027 --> 01:09:59.029
I love my son!

1260
01:09:59.029 --> 01:10:00.155
I love my son!

1261
01:10:01.406 --> 01:10:03.325
I love my son!

1262
01:10:03.325 --> 01:10:04.451
I love my son!

1263
01:10:05.535 --> 01:10:08.580
Hey, need some change? Take everything!

1264
01:10:11.166 --> 01:10:13.335
But it's not gonna make you happy.

1265
01:10:13.335 --> 01:10:15.462
I love my son!

1266
01:10:15.462 --> 01:10:16.588
I love my son!

1267
01:10:17.881 --> 01:10:19.007
I love my son!

1268
01:10:22.386 --> 01:10:24.554
- Hey, there you are!
- Hi.

1269
01:10:24.554 --> 01:10:25.597
- Just in time.

1270
01:10:26.598 --> 01:10:30.102
Oh! This is the happiest
moment of my entire life.

1271
01:10:30.102 --> 01:10:31.561
- Oh!

1272
01:10:31.561 --> 01:10:33.146
Well, mine...

1273
01:10:33.146 --> 01:10:36.233
Well, ours also.

1274
01:10:36.233 --> 01:10:39.236
- Hey, Gipper. I have
something for you, young man.

1275
01:10:40.779 --> 01:10:44.700
Oh! Watch yourself, it's
the claw!

1276
01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:46.368
Oh! The claw's coming at you.

1277
01:10:46.368 --> 01:10:49.955
Oh! You're scared of the claw.
You're scared of the claw.

1278
01:10:51.373 --> 01:10:52.749
- Jerry.

1279
01:10:52.749 --> 01:10:54.292
Jerry.

1280
01:10:54.292 --> 01:10:56.044
It's okay. You don't have to...

1281
01:10:56.044 --> 01:11:00.298
- Tower Air flight
1511 to Boston is now boarding.

1282
01:11:00.298 --> 01:11:01.717
- That's us.
- Yeah.

1283
01:11:01.717 --> 01:11:02.759
- You ready to go?

1284
01:11:02.759 --> 01:11:04.928
- Yes. You ready?

1285
01:11:04.928 --> 01:11:05.762
Okay.
- Great.

1286
01:11:15.021 --> 01:11:15.981
- Excuse me!

1287
01:11:17.107 --> 01:11:20.193
What gate is flight 1511
leaving from? It's an emergency!

1288
01:11:20.193 --> 01:11:22.154
- Gate number 123, but
you'll never make it.

1289
01:11:22.154 --> 01:11:23.238
The flight's already boarding.

1290
01:11:23.238 --> 01:11:25.991
It takes a half hour to
get through security.

1291
01:11:25.991 --> 01:11:27.826
If you wanna go to Boston,
there's another flight

1292
01:11:27.826 --> 01:11:29.536
leaving tomorrow morning at 7:00.

1293
01:11:29.536 --> 01:11:30.495
Flight number 120...

1294
01:11:34.541 --> 01:11:36.418
- Lady
and gentlemen, welcome aboard

1295
01:11:36.418 --> 01:11:40.005
flight 1511, from Los Angeles
to Boston's Logan Airport.

1296
01:11:40.005 --> 01:11:42.424
We'll be departing shortly,
if you need help...

1297
01:11:43.383 --> 01:11:44.217
- Honey, can I help you with those?

1298
01:11:44.217 --> 01:11:45.010
- I'm fine.

1299
01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:47.554
- Are you sure?

1300
01:11:47.554 --> 01:11:49.222
- Jerry, I can open the bag!

1301
01:11:51.391 --> 01:11:53.643
- Would you like anything
to drink before takeoff?

1302
01:11:53.643 --> 01:11:55.896
- Yes. Anything with alcohol, please.

1303
01:11:56.980 --> 01:11:57.814
- Audrey.

1304
01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:01.151
- Now, if
you'll focus on the screen

1305
01:12:01.151 --> 01:12:03.445
ahead of you, we will be
running the safety video.

1306
01:12:03.445 --> 01:12:05.280
- How about that drink?

1307
01:12:27.803 --> 01:12:29.304
- Max!

1308
01:12:29.304 --> 01:12:30.096
Max!

1309
01:12:32.516 --> 01:12:33.308
Max!

1310
01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:36.353
Wait!

1311
01:12:42.442 --> 01:12:44.444
- That ought to do it.

1312
01:12:47.697 --> 01:12:48.782
Hey!

1313
01:12:48.782 --> 01:12:51.368
- Thanks! It's running great!

1314
01:12:59.835 --> 01:13:00.627
Hey!

1315
01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:03.213
Hey!

1316
01:13:04.756 --> 01:13:05.549
Hey!

1317
01:13:18.562 --> 01:13:19.771
Max!

1318
01:13:19.771 --> 01:13:20.647
I'm coming!

1319
01:13:32.117 --> 01:13:33.702
Max!

1320
01:13:42.961 --> 01:13:44.254
Max!

1321
01:13:44.254 --> 01:13:45.797
Max! Where are you?

1322
01:13:51.887 --> 01:13:52.721
- I love you.

1323
01:13:55.807 --> 01:13:56.600
- Thank you.

1324
01:13:58.351 --> 01:14:01.229
- That wasn't exactly the
answer I was looking for.

1325
01:14:01.229 --> 01:14:03.523
- Thank you very much.

1326
01:14:08.361 --> 01:14:10.572
I'm sorry. It's just--

1327
01:14:10.572 --> 01:14:12.407
- Too fast? It was too fast, wasn't it?

1328
01:14:12.407 --> 01:14:13.950
- No, it's--

1329
01:14:13.950 --> 01:14:15.911
- Chemistry? Whatever it
is, we can work on it.

1330
01:14:15.911 --> 01:14:18.204
- No, no, no. It's just that--

1331
01:14:18.204 --> 01:14:20.498
- Oh my God, it's Fletcher!

1332
01:14:20.498 --> 01:14:23.168
- No, no. This has nothing
to do with Fletcher

1333
01:14:23.168 --> 01:14:26.630
- It's Fletcher.
- What?

1334
01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:27.505
- Dad?

1335
01:14:29.049 --> 01:14:34.012
- I made it! I'm late, but I made it!

1336
01:14:34.012 --> 01:14:35.972
- What is he doing?

1337
01:14:35.972 --> 01:14:37.641
- He came to see us off. Wave.

1338
01:14:43.146 --> 01:14:44.773
- I won't let you go!

1339
01:14:53.239 --> 01:14:54.324
Oh! Shit!

1340
01:15:00.372 --> 01:15:04.376
- Control 19, this is Tower
1511 heavy, ready for takeoff.

1341
01:15:04.376 --> 01:15:05.168
- Hey!

1342
01:15:11.675 --> 01:15:12.509
- What was that?

1343
01:15:12.509 --> 01:15:14.469
- Looked like a shoe.

1344
01:15:14.469 --> 01:15:15.428
- Pull over!

1345
01:15:16.763 --> 01:15:18.682
Pull this thing over!

1346
01:15:18.682 --> 01:15:21.851
- Control 19, some idiot has
hijacked a flight of stairs.

1347
01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:22.978
We're gonna stopping this plane.

1348
01:15:22.978 --> 01:15:24.604
- 19 Control, we copy.

1349
01:15:28.608 --> 01:15:29.651
- Yeah!

1350
01:16:08.398 --> 01:16:11.109
Yeah

1351
01:16:11.109 --> 01:16:14.904
You people are all doing a wonderful job!

1352
01:16:14.904 --> 01:16:15.822
- That's far enough, folks.

1353
01:16:15.822 --> 01:16:18.950
- Yeah, he's my husband.
He was my husband.

1354
01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:19.784
- All right, go ahead.

1355
01:16:19.784 --> 01:16:20.618
Okay.

1356
01:16:20.618 --> 01:16:24.247
Max, you stay here with Jerry,
and I'll be right back, okay.

1357
01:16:27.417 --> 01:16:28.418
- Audrey!
- Fletcher!

1358
01:16:28.418 --> 01:16:30.086
- Great news!

1359
01:16:30.086 --> 01:16:31.254
Both my legs are broken,

1360
01:16:31.254 --> 01:16:33.256
so they can't take me right to jail.

1361
01:16:33.256 --> 01:16:36.092
- Fletcher, what were you
doing? Are you out of your mind?

1362
01:16:36.092 --> 01:16:40.972
- No, I'm thinking clear.
I've never been this clear!

1363
01:16:40.972 --> 01:16:41.765
- Dad?

1364
01:16:43.141 --> 01:16:43.933
- Creep.

1365
01:16:45.310 --> 01:16:46.436
- He was getting kind of upset.

1366
01:16:46.436 --> 01:16:48.605
- Are you all right?

1367
01:16:48.605 --> 01:16:49.397
- Yeah.

1368
01:16:50.774 --> 01:16:52.067
I'm hurting here, though.

1369
01:16:53.276 --> 01:16:54.611
I'm a dope, Max.

1370
01:16:55.737 --> 01:16:57.322
All this time, you've been here,

1371
01:16:57.322 --> 01:17:00.158
and I could see you anytime
I felt like it, but I didn't.

1372
01:17:01.409 --> 01:17:03.161
Then your mom told me you
were moving to Boston,

1373
01:17:03.161 --> 01:17:04.329
and I started thinking.

1374
01:17:05.288 --> 01:17:07.290
I could be sitting around sometime and

1375
01:17:08.291 --> 01:17:11.795
wanna look at you and hold
you and play with you,

1376
01:17:13.421 --> 01:17:14.506
and I won't be able to.

1377
01:17:16.633 --> 01:17:18.885
I don't think I'm gonna
do too well with that.

1378
01:17:21.012 --> 01:17:24.516
I love you more than anything
else in the world, Max,

1379
01:17:24.516 --> 01:17:26.184
and you know it's true.

1380
01:17:27.143 --> 01:17:29.521
I couldn't say it if it
wasn't true, not today.

1381
01:17:32.148 --> 01:17:37.112
I love you, and I'll never hurt you again.

1382
01:17:41.074 --> 01:17:44.160
- He's telling the truth,
mom. He's not allowed to lie.

1383
01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:45.286
I made a wish, and anything

1384
01:17:45.286 --> 01:17:47.956
dad says today has to be the truth.

1385
01:17:47.956 --> 01:17:49.249
- Max.

1386
01:17:51.042 --> 01:17:51.876
It's 8:45.

1387
01:17:53.461 --> 01:17:54.921
You made the wish at 8:15.

1388
01:17:55.839 --> 01:17:58.133
I've been able to lie
for the last half-hour.

1389
01:17:59.092 --> 01:18:01.386
- So you weren't--
- No, it was the truth!

1390
01:18:01.386 --> 01:18:03.555
I just wanted to be honest with you.

1391
01:18:03.555 --> 01:18:05.348
I always wanna be honest with you.

1392
01:18:12.313 --> 01:18:13.106
- Mom,

1393
01:18:14.566 --> 01:18:16.985
do we have to go to Boston?

1394
01:18:21.948 --> 01:18:23.533
- No, Max, you don't have to go.

1395
01:18:28.163 --> 01:18:31.708
- I, on the other hand, do
have to, a hospital to run.

1396
01:18:34.252 --> 01:18:36.754
That's an open-ended ticket
if you ever change your mind.

1397
01:18:37.881 --> 01:18:38.673
- Thank you.

1398
01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:45.930
- Looks like he's got his father back.

1399
01:18:45.930 --> 01:18:48.516
- Yeah.

1400
01:19:07.118 --> 01:19:08.453
- Okay, Max, make a wish.

1401
01:19:08.453 --> 01:19:12.916
- Ah! Wait! I don't know
if we should do this.

1402
01:19:12.916 --> 01:19:14.500
- Oh, Fletcher, come on.

1403
01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:16.502
What are the odds of that happening again?

1404
01:19:18.963 --> 01:19:21.341
- Yeah, I guess you're right.

1405
01:19:21.341 --> 01:19:22.634
Okay, Max, go ahead.

1406
01:19:30.683 --> 01:19:31.559
- Mom? Dad?

1407
01:19:48.785 --> 01:19:49.994
- Max!

1408
01:19:54.082 --> 01:19:57.418
Did you wish for your mom and
I to get back together again?

1409
01:19:57.418 --> 01:19:59.379
- No, I wished for Roller blades.

1410
01:20:03.591 --> 01:20:05.343
- Do you wanna cut the cake,

1411
01:20:08.054 --> 01:20:09.681
dad?

1412
01:20:09.681 --> 01:20:10.807
- I'd love to.

1413
01:20:12.016 --> 01:20:14.143
But I have this horrible pain in my arm.

1414
01:20:14.143 --> 01:20:16.145
- Oh! No! It's the claw!

1415
01:20:16.145 --> 01:20:20.441
- No one can stop the claw!

1416
01:20:20.441 --> 01:20:23.361
No one can stop it!

1417
01:20:29.033 --> 01:20:31.160
Nothing can stop the claw!

1418
01:20:54.726 --> 01:20:55.977
If I was a boxer I would

1419
01:20:56.978 --> 01:20:59.230
bounce those things
like Sugar Ray Leonard.

1420
01:20:59.230 --> 01:21:00.064
I'm sorry.

1421
01:21:02.859 --> 01:21:04.610
You brought your kids to your divorce?

1422
01:21:04.610 --> 01:21:06.195
- Sympathy.
- Well, It's working!

1423
01:21:06.195 --> 01:21:09.657
I feel sorry for them already.

1424
01:21:09.657 --> 01:21:12.785
For this you will pay a terrible price.

1425
01:21:15.747 --> 01:21:18.333
Well, it's working! I feel
sorry for them already.

1426
01:21:31.929 --> 01:21:32.930
Mrs. Cole.

1427
01:21:46.944 --> 01:21:47.862
A goose!

1428
01:21:51.866 --> 01:21:52.825
Including...

1429
01:21:52.825 --> 01:21:54.369
- Prenuptial agreements.

1430
01:21:54.369 --> 01:21:56.329
- Prenuptial agreements!

1431
01:22:04.629 --> 01:22:07.882
No! I'd have got him $10,000.

1432
01:22:07.882 --> 01:22:08.716
- Good-bye, Mr. Reede.

1433
01:22:08.716 --> 01:22:13.388
- No! Wait! I didn't
understand...

1434
01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:40.039
Shit. I can't do it.

1435
01:22:40.039 --> 01:22:41.207
Now, let's see.

1436
01:22:41.207 --> 01:22:44.085
"Weight, 105?"

1437
01:22:44.085 --> 01:22:46.087
Yeah, in your bra.

1438
01:22:46.087 --> 01:22:47.088
- Your Honor, I object!

1439
01:22:47.088 --> 01:22:48.005
- You would!

1440
01:22:48.005 --> 01:22:49.674
- Over actor!
- Jezebel!

1441
01:22:55.221 --> 01:22:58.015
- He put me up to it. Tom Shadyac.

1442
01:22:59.809 --> 01:23:00.977
- Yeah, sure he did.

1443
01:23:00.977 --> 01:23:02.395
- Oh, he did.

1444
01:23:02.395 --> 01:23:05.273
- Oh, no.

1445
01:23:05.273 --> 01:23:06.482
They're onto me.
