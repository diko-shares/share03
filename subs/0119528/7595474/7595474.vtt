A liar? I'm sure you don't mean a liar.

13
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.470
He wears a suit and goes to court
and talks to the judge.

Mrs. Cole, the only problem here

229
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:03.240
is that after you've provided years
of faithful service and loving support

230

of raising his children... They are his?

231

Oh, yeah. One for sure.

232
00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.750
After all that,
your husband is denying you

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:17.130
a fair share of the marital assets
based on one single indiscretion.

234
00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:18.250
Seven.

235
00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:22.510
-Pardon me?
-Seven single acts of indiscretion.

236
00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:25.380
Seven acts of indiscretion,

237
00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:27.680
only one of which he has any evidence of,

238
00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:31.180
and all of which
he himself is responsible for.

joint custody of the kids.

He is, after all, a wonderful father.

249

But I don't have to care anymore.

and everything you don't do.

You're not a bad father, when you show up.

don't make me lose Max, too.

00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:27.200

-This is ironclad.

584
00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:30.790
This is the mother of all promises.
What time?

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:32.590

Ten to 6:00.

587
00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:38.840
All right.
But if I tell Max that you're coming,

588
00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:42.720
and you don't show up
and I have to see that look on his face,

589
00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:44.890
that heartbreaking look,

590
00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.180

I will lovingly wrap your knickknacks
with bubble paper.

I hope so.

Do you know what your son was doing
at 8:15 last night?

595
00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:04.870
He was making a birthday wish
that for just one day

596
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:06.660

-Dad!
-Could I borrow him for just one second?

604

-Monster Max!
-Dadzilla! You came to play catch?

605
00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:43.570
I'd like to, but I can't. I gotta talk to you.

606
00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:47.950
Your mommy told me about that wish
you made last night. It came true, Max.

607
00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:50.830
-You mean you have to tell the truth?
-Yes.

608
00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:53.000
-No matter what?
-No matter what!

609

-Is wrestling real?
-In the Olympics, yes. On channel 23, no.

610
00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:59.010
Will sitting near the TV set
make me go blind?

611
00:38:59.090 --> 00:39:00.550
Not in a million years.

612
00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:03.640
If I keep making this face,
will it get stuck that way?

613
00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:06.640
Uh-uh. In fact some people
make a good living that way.

614
00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:12.690
Now listen, Max.
You've gotta do something for me.

615
00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:15.310
I need you to take back that wish.

616
00:39:15.690 --> 00:39:18.030
-So you can lie?
-Yes.

617
00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:20.570
But not to you. You see, Max,

618
00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:25.280
sometimes grownups need to lie.

619
00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:29.370
It's hard to explain, but if...

620
00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:33.960
Here's a good example.
When your mommy was pregnant with you,

621
00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:36.670
she gained a good 40 pounds.
She ate everything.

622
00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:39.460
Daddy was scared.
But when she asked, "How do I look?"

623
00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:43.760
I said, "Honey, you look great.
You're beautiful. You're glowing."

624
00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:47.720
If I had said she looked like a cow,
it would have upset her.

625
00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:50.350
My teacher tells me real beauty
is on the inside.

626
00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:52.810
That's just something ugly people say.

627
00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:57.730
Max, no one can survive in the adult world
if they have to stick to the truth.

628
00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:01.950
I could lose my case, I could lose
my promotion, I could even lose my job.

00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:30.180
Now, I just need a little test.

636
00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:52.870
-Did it work?
-Not like I'd hoped. Did you unwish it?

-Only...
-What? Only what?

Yesterday, when I wished it,
I really meant it.

639
00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:02.970
This time when I unwished it,
I only did it because you told me to.

640
00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:06.090
All right. Do it again.

641
00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:08.100
And this time, mean it.

642
00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:10.510
-But I can't!
-Why not?

643
00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:13.930
-Because I don't want you to lie.
-I explained this.

-The company wouldn't give me one,

and I asked if you would give it to me
out of your own pocket,

685
00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:59.370

because it would create jealousy

Mr. Reede. Several years ago,
a friend had a burglar on her roof.

He fell through the skylight,
landed on a butcher's knife, cutting his leg.

The burglar sued my friend.
He sued my friend!

Is that justice?

No. I'd have got him $10,000.

I'm contesting custody.

1018
01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:37.560
-What?
-If I get sole custody of the kids,

1019
01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:40.150
that's another $10,000
in child support payments.

1020
01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:42.060
You just won $11 million!

1021
01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:44.980
Hey, I'm the victim here.
You said it yourself.

1022
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:47.820
Now I'm gonna hit him where it hurts.

1023
01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:53.490
(SOFTLY) But you said he was a good father.

1024
01:05:53.780 --> 01:05:54.870
So?

1025
01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:02.620
Mr. Reede, do we have an agreement
on custody or not?

1026
01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:06.960
No.

1027
01:06:08.130 --> 01:06:09.340
I see.

1028
01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:15.430
In that case, there will be a custody hearing
on the 19th at 9:00 a.m.

1029
01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:18.010

1034
01:06:32.070 --> 01:06:35.360
Come here, kids.
It's all right. Don't you worry.

1035
01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:38.610
I promise we'll be together,
whatever I have to do.

1036

They're mine!

You haven't paid for them yet.

1041

(LAUGHING) I love children.

1042
01:07:09.270 --> 01:07:12.020

in a case like this.

1043
01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:15.190

1044

He's stunned. He can't believe it.

Your Honor,
may I please approach the bench?

1046
01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:29.530
We're adjourned, Mr. Reede.

1047
01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:32.870
I think we've made a big mistake.

1048
01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:35.580
Mr. Reede, I am tired and very cranky.

1049
01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:39.170
I know, but this is just wrong, isn't it?

1050
01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:42.000
I manipulated the system.

1051
01:07:42.130 --> 01:07:45.710
Just because you bought it
doesn't mean I'm right. It's a technicality!

1052
01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:49.050
Young man, having my judgment
mocked in my own court

1053
01:07:49.130 --> 01:07:51.470
is not something I'm prepared to tolerate!

1054
01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:56.020
Tell that to the kids
when they're adopted by the Manson family!

1055
01:07:56.100 --> 01:08:00.140
One more word out of you, Mr. Reede,
and I'll hold you in contempt!

1056
01:08:00.230 --> 01:08:03.310
I hold myself in contempt!

1057
01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:05.480
Why should you be any different?

1058

Bailiff, take him away!

1059
01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:10.700
This man is a good father,
and children are not leverage!

1060

No, don't do this!
I have a date to play ball with my son!

1061

1089

What were you doing? Are you crazy?

1187
01:16:35.220 --> 01:16:39.770
No, I'm thinking clear.
I've never been this clear!

-Creep.

-Are you all right?

All this time, you've been here,

1193
01:16:56.780 --> 01:16:59.450
and I could see you anytime, but I didn't.

1194
01:17:00.450 --> 01:17:04.420
Then your mom told me you were moving
to Boston, and I started thinking.

1195
01:17:04.540 --> 01:17:07.130
I could be sitting around sometime and

1196
01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:11.300
want to look at you
and hold you and play with you,

1197
01:17:12.420 --> 01:17:14.420
and I won't be able to.

1198

I'm gonna do too well with that.

I love you more than anything else
in the world, Max,

1200
01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:25.640
and you know it's true.

1201

has to be the truth.

-No, it was the truth!

I always want to be honest with you.
