1
00:01:40.726 --> 00:01:43.096
It's small!

2
00:01:56.825 --> 00:01:58.985
No, please. No!
Please!

3
00:01:59.245 --> 00:02:00.575
Davey!

4
00:02:01.035 --> 00:02:03.075
Come a runnin', lad!

5
00:02:04.915 --> 00:02:07.164
- Stop!
- Brand you like a damn steer!

6
00:02:07.424 --> 00:02:09.824
- Bitch!
- No. Please!

7
00:02:10.094 --> 00:02:12.374
Hold the bitch, Davey!
Go on, hold her!

8
00:02:12.634 --> 00:02:16.004
Hold her, damn it,
or I'll cut her tits off!

9
00:02:16.344 --> 00:02:18.344
Go get Skinny! Quick!

10
00:02:19.724 --> 00:02:21.054
Mike, don't!

11
00:02:26.653 --> 00:02:27.643
Skinny!

12
00:02:28.113 --> 00:02:29.563
You think it's funny?

13
00:02:31.693 --> 00:02:33.853
Skinny, get the gun!

14
00:02:44.332 --> 00:02:46.662
Get off of her, cowboy.

15
00:02:53.342 --> 00:02:55.921
- They wouldn't let you settle it, huh?
- Hell, you know how Skinny is.

16
00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:59.591
He says he's gonna shoot 'em.
I says, "Skinny, you can't do that."

17
00:02:59.851 --> 00:03:01.671
and he says, "Well let's get Little Bill
in here and settle this thing."

18
00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:03.271
and I says, "Little Bill's sleeping."

19
00:03:03.521 --> 00:03:07.181
He says, "He don't care."
In another five minutes he's gonna shoot them boys.

20
00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.160
She going to die?

21
00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.200
She's going to live.

22
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.210
She didn't steal nothing...
she didn't even touch his poke.

23
00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.129
All she done, when she seen
he had a teensy little pecker...

24
00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.009
...was give a giggle, that's all.
She didn't know no better.

25
00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:40.719
You can hang 'em, Little Bill.

26
00:03:58.488 --> 00:04:00.048
Clyde...

27
00:04:01.788 --> 00:04:04.247
step over to the office
and get the bullwhip.

28
00:04:05.837 --> 00:04:09.117
A whippin? That's all they get
after what they done?

29
00:04:11.387 --> 00:04:14.587
- Whippin' ain't no little thing, Alice.
- But what they done they...

30
00:04:14.647 --> 00:04:16.837
Alice! Shut up!

31
00:04:19.446 --> 00:04:22.426
- Little Bill... whippin' ain't going to settle this.
- Oh no?

32
00:04:22.686 --> 00:04:26.306
This here's a lawful contract between me
and Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut whore.

33
00:04:28.856 --> 00:04:32.396
I brought her clear from Boston,
paid her expenses and all.

34
00:04:32.906 --> 00:04:36.325
I got a contract that represents
an investment of capital.

35
00:04:36.615 --> 00:04:37.865
Property.

36
00:04:38.285 --> 00:04:39.905
Damaged property.

37
00:04:41.455 --> 00:04:43.745
Like if I was to hamstring
one of their cow ponies.

38
00:04:45.255 --> 00:04:47.375
Well you figure nobody'll wanna
fuck her now, right?

39
00:04:49.335 --> 00:04:50.745
Hell, no!

40
00:04:51.095 --> 00:04:52.795
Least ways won't pay to do it!

41
00:04:53.134 --> 00:04:55.144
Maybe she can clean up
the place or something,

42
00:04:55.234 --> 00:04:57.344
but nobody's going to pay
good money for a cut-up whore!

43
00:05:00.894 --> 00:05:05.224
You boys are off the Bar T.
You got your own string of ponies?

44
00:05:05.894 --> 00:05:07.974
Yeah, I got four.

45
00:05:10.573 --> 00:05:12.193
Six.

46
00:05:13.693 --> 00:05:16.443
Guess you'd just as soon
not have a trial, no fuss, huh?

47
00:05:17.163 --> 00:05:18.443
No, sir.

48
00:05:19.413 --> 00:05:20.493
All right.

49
00:05:21.163 --> 00:05:22.783
You did the cutting.

50
00:05:23.123 --> 00:05:26.622
Come the fall, you bring in five ponies
and you give them over to Skinny here.

51
00:05:27.292 --> 00:05:28.542
Five?

52
00:05:28.922 --> 00:05:31.592
And you!
You bring in two.

53
00:05:31.842 --> 00:05:33.962
- You give them over, you hear?
- Yes, sir.

54
00:05:34.842 --> 00:05:36.122
The bullwhip Bill.

55
00:05:39.012 --> 00:05:41.012
Maybe we don't need this whip now.

56
00:05:42.642 --> 00:05:47.141
Let me tell you, come the spring,
Skinny don't have those ponies...

57
00:05:48.361 --> 00:05:51.521
- I'm gonna come looking for you.
- You ain't even gonna whip 'em?

58
00:05:53.611 --> 00:05:55.771
Well I fined them instead, Alice.

59
00:05:56.071 --> 00:05:59.441
For what they done, Skinny gets
some ponies and that's it?!

60
00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.990
That ain't fair Little Bill.

61
00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:03.570
That ain't fair!

62
00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.300
Haven't you seen enough
blood for one night, hmm?

63
00:06:17.179 --> 00:06:18.719
Hell, Alice!

64
00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:24.369
It ain't like they was tramps
or loafers or bad men.

65
00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:25.799
You know, they were just...

66
00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:28.739
...hardworking boys that was foolish.

67
00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:31.649
If they was given over to wickedness
in a regular way I'd understand...

68
00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:32.849
Like whores?

69
00:06:33.778 --> 00:06:36.568
Alice!... Tend to Delilah.

70
00:06:39.198 --> 00:06:40.528
Go ahead.

71
00:07:03.057 --> 00:07:04.637
I got $85.

72
00:07:04.897 --> 00:07:06.357
I don't know.

73
00:07:06.816 --> 00:07:10.096
If Delilah doesn't care one way or the
other, what are we getting so riled up about?

74
00:07:10.566 --> 00:07:14.016
Just because we let them smelly
fools ride us like horses...

75
00:07:14.276 --> 00:07:17.486
...don't mean we gotta let
them brand us like horses.

76
00:07:17.906 --> 00:07:22.986
Maybe we ain't nothing but whores,
but we... by God, we ain't horses!

77
00:07:24.625 --> 00:07:26.945
I got $112.

78
00:07:28.125 --> 00:07:29.375
That's everything.

79
00:07:29.625 --> 00:07:31.125
How about you, Faith?

80
00:07:34.555 --> 00:07:35.465
200.

81
00:07:37.515 --> 00:07:39.884
$240.

82
00:07:41.144 --> 00:07:43.424
Jesus, Faith!
What you been doing?

83
00:07:43.814 --> 00:07:46.214
You been giving Skinny something special?

84
00:07:51.114 --> 00:07:52.904
She laughed.

85
00:07:56.194 --> 00:07:59.983
With what Kate got, and Silky got some,
and then mine and Little Sue...

86
00:08:00.243 --> 00:08:01.443
It ain't enough.

87
00:08:03.623 --> 00:08:05.163
Not yet, maybe.

88
00:08:45.751 --> 00:08:48.320
You don't look like no rootin'-tootin'...

89
00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:51.000
...son-of-a-bitching cold-blooded assassin.

90
00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.090
Say what?

91
00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.800
My guess is you're calling
yourself Mr. William Munny.

92
00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.479
You have me confused with
someone else, mister.

93
00:09:05.939 --> 00:09:09.019
The same one who shot Charlie Pepper
up in Lake County?

94
00:09:09.819 --> 00:09:11.299
Pa! Hey Pa!

95
00:09:11.569 --> 00:09:13.029
Yeah, what's up, son?

96
00:09:13.279 --> 00:09:15.269
Two more hogs got the fever.

97
00:09:15.909 --> 00:09:17.319
You shot Charlie Pepper didn't you?

98
00:09:17.579 --> 00:09:20.908
...and you're the one who killed William Harvey
and robbed that train over in Missouri.

99
00:09:21.158 --> 00:09:22.438
Now hold on, mister.

100
00:09:23.578 --> 00:09:26.368
Son, get those hogs separated there.

101
00:09:26.788 --> 00:09:28.498
Penny, why don't you help your brother out.

102
00:09:28.798 --> 00:09:30.998
That one's sick too.

103
00:09:35.468 --> 00:09:37.377
We'll talk inside.

104
00:09:44.807 --> 00:09:47.767
So you're Pete Sothow's nephew, huh?

105
00:09:48.937 --> 00:09:53.646
I thought maybe you was someone come to kill
me for something I'd done in the old days.

106
00:09:55.446 --> 00:09:56.696
I could have.

107
00:09:57.036 --> 00:09:58.066
Easy.

108
00:10:00.366 --> 00:10:02.576
I guess maybe so.

109
00:10:03.916 --> 00:10:09.036
Like I was sayin' you don't look like
no meaner-than-hell, cold-blooded, damn killer.

110
00:10:10.165 --> 00:10:11.575
Maybe I ain't.

111
00:10:11.835 --> 00:10:16.215
Yeah, well Uncle Pete says you was the
meanest goddamn son-of-a-bitch alive.

112
00:10:16.465 --> 00:10:18.875
And if I ever wanted a
partner for a killing...

113
00:10:19.475 --> 00:10:21.265
...you were the worst one.

114
00:10:24.855 --> 00:10:26.595
Meaning the best.

115
00:10:27.024 --> 00:10:29.554
On account as you're
as cold as the snow...

116
00:10:29.814 --> 00:10:32.684
...and you don't have
no weak nerve nor fear.

117
00:10:35.284 --> 00:10:36.984
Pete said that, huh?

118
00:10:38.574 --> 00:10:40.314
Yeah, he did.

119
00:10:40.994 --> 00:10:42.864
I'm a damn killer myself, except...

120
00:10:43.124 --> 00:10:46.323
...I ain't killed as many as
you because of my youth.

121
00:10:46.583 --> 00:10:49.073
Schofield Kid, that's what they call me.

122
00:10:52.293 --> 00:10:53.623
Why?

123
00:10:53.883 --> 00:10:56.123
You from Schofield?

124
00:10:56.513 --> 00:10:58.133
No, it's on account...

125
00:10:58.383 --> 00:11:01.832
...of my Schofield model
Smith & Wesson pistol.

126
00:11:06.732 --> 00:11:08.182
How about it, Will?

127
00:11:09.232 --> 00:11:10.772
How about what?

128
00:11:11.232 --> 00:11:13.442
How about being my partner?

129
00:11:13.902 --> 00:11:16.622
I'm heading up North in
through Niobrara up to Wyoming.

130
00:11:16.682 --> 00:11:19.521
Gonna kill a couple of no-good cowboys.

131
00:11:21.241 --> 00:11:22.491
For what?

132
00:11:22.791 --> 00:11:26.741
For cutting up a lady.
Cut up her face.

133
00:11:27.041 --> 00:11:29.791
Cut her eyes out,
cut her ears off.

134
00:11:30.341 --> 00:11:33.041
Hell, they even cut her teets.

135
00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:37.500
Jesus!

136
00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:40.670
$1,000 reward, Will.

137
00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:43.430
500 apiece.

138
00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.810
Pa... I can't move those damn pigs!

139
00:11:50.859 --> 00:11:54.439
Watch your cussing now, will you?
Do the best you can with it.

140
00:11:54.699 --> 00:11:57.779
Then go to the pump
and get cleaned up. Come on.

141
00:12:04.409 --> 00:12:06.659
I ain't like that anymore, Kid.

142
00:12:08.128 --> 00:12:11.378
It was whiskey done it as
much as anything else.

143
00:12:11.758 --> 00:12:14.038
I ain't had a drop in over 10 years.

144
00:12:14.588 --> 00:12:18.208
My wife, she cured me of that.

145
00:12:19.428 --> 00:12:22.678
Cured me of drinking and wickedness.

146
00:12:24.307 --> 00:12:26.517
Well you don't look so prosperous.

147
00:12:28.687 --> 00:12:31.727
Hell, you could buy her a new
dress with your half.

148
00:12:31.987 --> 00:12:34.507
If we kill them two, you can buy
your wife one of them fancy...

149
00:12:34.817 --> 00:12:36.567
She's passed on.

150
00:12:37.417 --> 00:12:38.867
What?

151
00:12:40.746 --> 00:12:43.026
Been gone near 3 years now.

152
00:12:49.336 --> 00:12:51.666
Don't tell no one else
about the reward and all.

153
00:12:51.936 --> 00:12:54.166
I don't need other
gunmen trying to collect.

154
00:12:55.046 --> 00:12:56.926
We don't see no one out here.

155
00:12:57.745 --> 00:12:58.525
Yeah.

156
00:12:58.615 --> 00:13:01.305
Well if you was to change your mind,
might be you could catch me,

157
00:13:01.365 --> 00:13:05.205
I'll be riding due West to the Western
Trail heading North into Wyoming.

158
00:13:10.355 --> 00:13:12.685
Come on, let's separate those hogs.

159
00:13:42.623 --> 00:13:44.333
Pa... two of them others...

160
00:13:44.853 --> 00:13:47.093
I think they got the fever.

161
00:14:45.209 --> 00:14:47.109
Took you boys a while.

162
00:14:47.369 --> 00:14:51.699
A couple more days and I was
going to call on the sheriff.

163
00:14:51.959 --> 00:14:53.209
How about that?

164
00:14:53.459 --> 00:14:56.578
The river was all swelled up.
Couldn't cross it.

165
00:14:56.838 --> 00:14:59.628
I bet. Sleepy,
get them horses on in the livery.

166
00:14:59.888 --> 00:15:02.508
Neil, take that one
over around the back.

167
00:15:10.108 --> 00:15:12.507
Ah, now here's a beauty.

168
00:15:13.067 --> 00:15:15.857
You got two of mine.
This here one ain't yours.

169
00:15:16.107 --> 00:15:17.857
Oh, we gonna see about that.

170
00:15:19.987 --> 00:15:21.947
Bastards!
Get out of town!

171
00:15:23.907 --> 00:15:26.367
You are very sick sons of bitches!

172
00:15:31.166 --> 00:15:32.496
Don't come back, butcher!

173
00:15:32.756 --> 00:15:34.206
This here pony...

174
00:15:34.966 --> 00:15:37.836
...I brung for the lady,
the one my partner cut.

175
00:15:49.855 --> 00:15:51.225
She's the best of the lot.

176
00:15:56.565 --> 00:15:58.315
Better than the ones I gave him.

177
00:16:03.034 --> 00:16:04.774
She can sell her or...

178
00:16:05.374 --> 00:16:07.074
...or do what she wants.

179
00:16:10.794 --> 00:16:15.534
A pony? She ain't got no face left,
you're gonna give her a god-damned mangy pony?

180
00:16:16.294 --> 00:16:17.873
She ain't mangy ma'am!

181
00:16:18.343 --> 00:16:20.543
Get out of here!

182
00:16:21.723 --> 00:16:24.123
We don't need your goddamn charity!

183
00:16:24.683 --> 00:16:27.253
Get out of our town
and don't come back!

184
00:16:29.393 --> 00:16:31.273
Get out of our town!

185
00:17:43.968 --> 00:17:46.968
Did Pa use to kill folks?

186
00:18:55.504 --> 00:18:58.874
Penny, I could tell your Ma liked
those flowers I gave her.

187
00:18:59.134 --> 00:19:02.834
He ain't hardly a saddle horse no more, Pa.
He ain't used to the feel.

188
00:19:04.184 --> 00:19:06.093
You take care of your sister now, son...

189
00:19:06.353 --> 00:19:11.093
and you kill a few chickens if you have to,
and keep those hogs that got the fever separate.

190
00:19:11.353 --> 00:19:16.063
If you have any problem, you go see
Sally Two Trees at Ned Logan's.

191
00:19:41.181 --> 00:19:44.511
Ain't hardly been in the saddle
myself in a while.

192
00:19:48.181 --> 00:19:51.881
This old horse is getting even with me
for the sins of my youth.

193
00:19:52.151 --> 00:19:56.310
In my youth before I met
your dear departed Ma...

194
00:19:56.570 --> 00:20:00.150
...I used to be weak
and given to mistreating animals.

195
00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:09.950
This horse and
those hogs over there...

196
00:20:12.829 --> 00:20:15.949
...are getting even with me for
the cruelty that I inflicted.

197
00:20:16.209 --> 00:20:17.959
I used to be able to cuss...

198
00:20:18.219 --> 00:20:23.009
...and whip a horse like this, but your Ma,
rest her soul, showed me the error of my ways.

199
00:20:24.599 --> 00:20:26.059
I'll be back in a couple of weeks.

200
00:20:27.019 --> 00:20:31.178
You remember how the spirit of your
dear departed Ma watches over you.

201
00:20:49.117 --> 00:20:52.037
- Where'd you get that money?
- We ain't got any money!

202
00:20:52.287 --> 00:20:55.627
- You told them cowboys you had it!
- We was lying!

203
00:20:56.087 --> 00:20:57.747
Lying?

204
00:20:58.007 --> 00:21:00.927
What are you gonna do when
somebody comes to collect?

205
00:21:02.556 --> 00:21:05.966
You going to hump them
a thousand times?

206
00:21:08.596 --> 00:21:12.646
The kind of people who come after that thousand
won't tolerate you not having it!

207
00:21:16.146 --> 00:21:18.275
They won't just cut up your face a little!

208
00:21:22.535 --> 00:21:24.735
You stupid bitches.

209
00:21:25.455 --> 00:21:27.405
You stupid bitches!

210
00:21:39.844 --> 00:21:40.874
Shit!

211
00:21:41.134 --> 00:21:43.674
Damn it! Jesus!

212
00:21:45.554 --> 00:21:46.884
Hit your finger, huh?

213
00:21:49.394 --> 00:21:50.934
Hello, Skinny.

214
00:21:51.474 --> 00:21:53.383
Damn, you snuck up on me.

215
00:21:54.103 --> 00:21:56.233
What do you think of her?

216
00:21:56.483 --> 00:21:59.023
Well, I heard you done the roof yourself.

217
00:21:59.273 --> 00:22:03.853
Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I did practically
the whole damn thing myself.

218
00:22:04.113 --> 00:22:07.983
The Roberts boy he carried some
wood for me, but that's all.

219
00:22:08.243 --> 00:22:10.122
What is all that wood?

220
00:22:10.412 --> 00:22:11.762
Well that's for my porch.

221
00:22:11.912 --> 00:22:14.162
I'm building a porch
so I can sit of an evening...

222
00:22:14.422 --> 00:22:18.962
...and smoke my pipe and drink coffee
and watch the sunset.

223
00:22:21.882 --> 00:22:24.552
Well... Came all the way out here
just to take a look at her, huh?

224
00:22:24.802 --> 00:22:26.791
- Oh them whores!
- Yeah?

225
00:22:27.051 --> 00:22:31.221
Them whores have been humping them cowboys
who been in town the last 2 weeks.

226
00:22:32.811 --> 00:22:34.441
Shit, Skinny.

227
00:22:36.151 --> 00:22:39.071
You know... We got railroad barons.
We got cattle barons.

228
00:22:39.321 --> 00:22:41.561
You're gonna be the first billiard baron.

229
00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:46.310
Yeah, well, they been humping them and
telling every bowlegged one of them...

230
00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:49.580
...that, uh, they're paying $1,000
to whatever son-of-a-bitch...

231
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:52.830
...kills the two boys
that cut up Delilah.

232
00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:59.289
Those cowboys are riding that beef
down to Kansas and Cheyenne?

233
00:23:07.309 --> 00:23:08.719
How long? All week?

234
00:23:09.019 --> 00:23:11.469
Well I didn't hear nothing
till last night myself.

235
00:23:12.099 --> 00:23:15.768
Hell, the word's probably got
all the way to Texas by now.

236
00:23:16.898 --> 00:23:18.978
Shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna
come clear from Texas.

237
00:23:21.488 --> 00:23:23.278
You sure those whores got all that money?

238
00:23:23.778 --> 00:23:26.028
Well, you know how women can lie.

239
00:23:26.178 --> 00:23:29.028
Knock 'em around a little bit, ask 'em
where the money is, they ain't got none.

240
00:23:29.288 --> 00:23:33.577
But they could have squirreled away
that much the five of 'em. Maybe.

241
00:23:36.667 --> 00:23:38.247
That much, huh?

242
00:23:39.717 --> 00:23:41.667
You could run off them two cowboys.

243
00:23:42.677 --> 00:23:44.587
I could run off them whores.

244
00:23:47.597 --> 00:23:50.516
Well, I guess they'll just up and
run anyhow, them two.

245
00:23:53.836 --> 00:23:56.766
Nope...
They'll stay out there at the Bar T.

246
00:23:57.526 --> 00:23:59.186
Close to their friends.

247
00:24:00.776 --> 00:24:03.866
Shit, could be nobody won't come at all.

248
00:24:06.365 --> 00:24:08.605
Well, gotta go.
I like your house.

249
00:24:43.153 --> 00:24:45.233
Well, I'll be...

250
00:24:46.453 --> 00:24:48.073
It's Will!

251
00:24:52.753 --> 00:24:53.673
Hey Will!

252
00:24:54.713 --> 00:24:58.162
Come on in the house out
of the sun. Sally...

253
00:24:58.422 --> 00:25:00.332
...see to Will's horse.

254
00:25:00.462 --> 00:25:01.632
Sally.

255
00:25:05.512 --> 00:25:07.252
What you doing here Will?

256
00:25:07.852 --> 00:25:10.002
Just thought I'd drop in on you.

257
00:25:11.772 --> 00:25:14.341
Yeah, Will, we ain't bad men no more.

258
00:25:14.691 --> 00:25:16.351
Shit, we're farmers.

259
00:25:16.771 --> 00:25:21.561
Should be easy killing them,
supposing they don't go on down to Texas first.

260
00:25:23.031 --> 00:25:27.281
How long has it been since you fired a gun
at a man Will? Nine, ten years?

261
00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:30.610
Eleven.

262
00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:33.780
Easy, huh?

263
00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:37.880
I don't know it was
all that easy even back then.

264
00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:40.370
And we were young and full of beans.

265
00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:43.290
Mean, if you was mad at them Will, I mean...

266
00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:46.669
...if they done you some wrong,
I could see shooting them.

267
00:25:47.349 --> 00:25:50.049
We done stuff for money before Ned.

268
00:25:53.599 --> 00:25:55.729
We thought we did.

269
00:25:55.979 --> 00:25:59.019
All right so what'd these fellows do?
Cheat at cards?

270
00:25:59.279 --> 00:26:02.808
Steal some strays?
Spit on a rich fellow? What?

271
00:26:03.198 --> 00:26:04.608
Naw, they cut up a woman.

272
00:26:04.988 --> 00:26:06.268
What?

273
00:26:07.658 --> 00:26:12.868
Cut up her face, cut her eyes out,
cut her fingers off, cut her tits.

274
00:26:14.588 --> 00:26:16.828
Everything but her cunny,
I suppose.

275
00:26:18.758 --> 00:26:20.327
I'll be dogged.

276
00:26:24.847 --> 00:26:26.667
Well... guess they got it coming.

277
00:26:28.267 --> 00:26:29.757
Of course, you know Will...

278
00:26:31.017 --> 00:26:33.937
...if Claudia was alive,
you wouldn't be doing this.

279
00:26:44.366 --> 00:26:47.236
Don't suppose you'd mind looking in
on my youngsters next week?

280
00:26:47.496 --> 00:26:49.666
They got some hogs
they're trying to separate.

281
00:26:49.936 --> 00:26:52.096
Will?...

282
00:26:52.835 --> 00:26:54.195
How long you reckon you're gonna be?

283
00:26:56.955 --> 00:26:58.455
Two weeks, I guess.

284
00:27:01.475 --> 00:27:02.555
Will?...

285
00:27:07.775 --> 00:27:08.555
Um...

286
00:27:10.474 --> 00:27:12.054
This Kid, what's he like?

287
00:27:15.224 --> 00:27:16.504
Three ways?

288
00:27:18.564 --> 00:27:21.314
I see you still have that Spencer rifle, huh?

289
00:27:23.404 --> 00:27:26.773
Yeah... and I can still knock the
eye out of a bird flying too.

290
00:27:36.083 --> 00:27:37.623
Jesus, Will!

291
00:28:34.809 --> 00:28:36.799
He must be moving right along.

292
00:28:37.309 --> 00:28:39.979
We'll come across him
tomorrow, I reckon.

293
00:28:51.748 --> 00:28:53.658
Kind of got used to my bed.

294
00:28:53.918 --> 00:28:56.368
This ain't going to be like no home.

295
00:28:57.498 --> 00:29:00.248
Bed ain't the only thing I'm gonna
be missing, I tell ya.

296
00:29:05.798 --> 00:29:07.127
Hell, Will, I'm sorry.

297
00:29:07.757 --> 00:29:11.257
Don't fret it.
It ain't nothing.

298
00:29:13.597 --> 00:29:15.397
She don't like it much does she...

299
00:29:15.647 --> 00:29:17.387
...you riding off with me?

300
00:29:18.397 --> 00:29:20.227
Gave me the evil eye.

301
00:29:24.196 --> 00:29:26.436
You know, Sally's injun...

302
00:29:27.326 --> 00:29:29.486
...and injuns ain't over-friendly Will.

303
00:29:31.706 --> 00:29:33.116
I don't blame her.

304
00:29:34.536 --> 00:29:36.446
I ain't gonna hold it against her.

305
00:29:36.706 --> 00:29:38.616
She knew me back then.

306
00:29:39.216 --> 00:29:40.625
She knew what a...

307
00:29:41.215 --> 00:29:43.615
...no-good son-of-a-bitch I was.

308
00:29:45.465 --> 00:29:48.045
She just ain't allowing that I've changed.

309
00:29:48.885 --> 00:29:51.635
She don't realize I
ain't like that no more.

310
00:29:51.895 --> 00:29:54.215
- You know Will....
- I ain't the same, Ned.

311
00:29:55.725 --> 00:30:00.474
Claudia straightened me up.
Cleared me of drinking whiskey and all.

312
00:30:01.904 --> 00:30:03.604
Just cause we're going on this killing...

313
00:30:03.864 --> 00:30:06.944
...that don't mean I'm gonna go
back to being the way I was.

314
00:30:08.324 --> 00:30:09.984
Just need the money.

315
00:30:10.494 --> 00:30:12.813
Get a new start for them youngsters.

316
00:30:18.583 --> 00:30:20.913
Ned, you remember that drover
I shot through the mouth...

317
00:30:21.173 --> 00:30:23.743
...and his teeth came
out the back of his head?

318
00:30:27.093 --> 00:30:29.173
I think about him now and again.

319
00:30:32.352 --> 00:30:35.102
He didn't do anything
to deserve to get shot...

320
00:30:36.022 --> 00:30:38.772
...least nothing I could
remember when I sobered up.

321
00:30:44.112 --> 00:30:46.681
You was one crazy son-of-a-bitch Will.

322
00:30:49.951 --> 00:30:52.901
Yeah, no one liked me
and the boys all thought...

323
00:30:53.161 --> 00:30:55.621
...I was gonna shoot them
out of pure meanness.

324
00:30:58.211 --> 00:31:00.121
You ain't like that no more.

325
00:31:01.041 --> 00:31:03.200
Eagle, he hated my guts.

326
00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:07.460
Bonaparte didn't think too much of me either.

327
00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:09.800
Quincy neither, I reckon.

328
00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:15.220
Quincy used to just watch all the time...

329
00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:18.140
...scared.

330
00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:20.809
Well, like I said...

331
00:31:22.319 --> 00:31:24.229
...you ain't like that no more.

332
00:31:25.239 --> 00:31:26.569
That's right.

333
00:31:28.159 --> 00:31:30.069
I'm just a fellow now.

334
00:31:30.329 --> 00:31:33.159
I ain't no different than anyone else...

335
00:31:33.909 --> 00:31:35.159
...no more.

336
00:31:50.558 --> 00:31:55.547
All I wanna know is what son-of-a-bitch shot him is all?
Was it one of them John Bulls?

337
00:31:55.807 --> 00:32:00.307
Oh, no, sir. I believe the would-be assassin
to be a gentleman of French ancestry.

338
00:32:00.567 --> 00:32:04.347
Or so it would seem. I don't wish to
give offense when I observe...

339
00:32:04.607 --> 00:32:08.527
...but the French are known
to be a race of assassins...

340
00:32:08.787 --> 00:32:10.776
...though they can't shoot worth a damn.

341
00:32:11.036 --> 00:32:14.696
Any Frenchmen in the present
company are excluded, of course.

342
00:32:14.956 --> 00:32:19.696
Says here a fellow by the name
of Guiteau. G-U-I-T--

343
00:32:19.956 --> 00:32:23.626
Sure as hell sounds
like a John Bull to me.

344
00:32:24.046 --> 00:32:29.675
Well sir, again, I don't wish to give offense
when I suggest that this country should select...

345
00:32:29.925 --> 00:32:34.225
...a king or even a queen,
rather than a President.

346
00:32:36.185 --> 00:32:39.105
One isn't that quick
to shoot a king or a queen.

347
00:32:39.355 --> 00:32:41.895
The majesty of royalty, you see.

348
00:32:44.984 --> 00:32:47.904
Well maybe you don't wish
to give offense, sir...

349
00:32:48.194 --> 00:32:50.324
...but you are giving it pretty thick.

350
00:32:50.744 --> 00:32:53.494
This country don't need no
queens whatsoever I reckon.

351
00:32:53.824 --> 00:32:56.494
- As a matter of fact when I heared about queens...
- Shut up, Joe.

352
00:32:56.744 --> 00:32:59.504
What the hell's wrong with you, Thirsty?
This dude son-of-a-bitch...

353
00:32:59.753 --> 00:33:02.623
Might be that this dude
here is English Bob.

354
00:33:03.633 --> 00:33:06.663
He's the one works for the
railroad shooting Chinamen.

355
00:33:06.923 --> 00:33:10.753
Might be he's waiting for some
crazy cowboy to touch his pistol...

356
00:33:11.013 --> 00:33:12.633
...so he can shoot him down.

357
00:33:24.442 --> 00:33:26.182
Is that a fact, mister?

358
00:33:27.192 --> 00:33:28.942
You English Bob?

359
00:33:31.622 --> 00:33:32.612
Pheasants.

360
00:33:35.041 --> 00:33:37.031
Let's shoot some pheasants.

361
00:33:37.291 --> 00:33:38.531
Ten shots.

362
00:33:38.871 --> 00:33:41.541
At, let's say, $1 a pheasant.

363
00:33:42.211 --> 00:33:45.381
I'll shoot for the Queen, and you...

364
00:33:45.801 --> 00:33:47.381
...for... well, whomever.

365
00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:05.810
That's eight for me and one for you.

366
00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:08.639
That comes to seven of your American dollars.

367
00:34:09.319 --> 00:34:11.319
Pretty damn good shooting...

368
00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:13.649
...for a John Bull.

369
00:34:14.159 --> 00:34:16.909
Well no doubt your aim was
affected by your grief...

370
00:34:19.329 --> 00:34:21.829
...over the injury to your President.

371
00:34:34.018 --> 00:34:38.098
Ah, it's the climate that does it.
That, and the infernal distances.

372
00:34:38.438 --> 00:34:39.428
Does what?

373
00:34:39.858 --> 00:34:42.937
Induces people to shoot
persons in high places.

374
00:34:43.857 --> 00:34:45.137
Yeah, uh...

375
00:34:45.357 --> 00:34:47.467
You know it's a savage country really.

376
00:34:47.557 --> 00:34:50.737
That's the second one they've
shot in twenty years.

377
00:34:51.287 --> 00:34:54.987
It's uncivilized shooting
persons of substance.

378
00:35:51.933 --> 00:35:53.173
Thank you.

379
00:35:55.933 --> 00:35:57.343
Pardon me, gentlemen.

380
00:35:59.683 --> 00:36:02.313
The local ordinance obliges you
to surrender all sidearms...

381
00:36:02.383 --> 00:36:05.312
to the proper authorities for
the duration of your visit.

382
00:36:06.112 --> 00:36:07.392
Proper authority?

383
00:36:10.532 --> 00:36:12.452
Well I can assure you young man...

384
00:36:12.532 --> 00:36:15.952
that neither my companion
or I carry firearms on our person.

385
00:36:16.342 --> 00:36:19.422
We rely upon the goodwill
of our fellow man...

386
00:36:19.562 --> 00:36:22.841
...and the forbearance of reptiles.

387
00:36:36.471 --> 00:36:38.220
Unarmed, my ass!

388
00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:40.680
Oh, Christ, it's hot!

389
00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:45.520
If I'm going to get shot,
I'd rather it was hot than cold.

390
00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:47.900
Everything hurts me more when it's cold.

391
00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:50.200
You know how if you hit
your thumb and it's cold...

392
00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:51.550
Shut up, Fatty!

393
00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:53.569
I only said...

394
00:36:53.669 --> 00:36:55.169
Clyde's back.

395
00:36:55.249 --> 00:36:57.069
- Is Little Bill with him?
- No.

396
00:36:57.869 --> 00:36:58.899
Shit!

397
00:37:04.339 --> 00:37:07.129
- You boys clean my Remington?
- Cleaned and loaded.

398
00:37:08.299 --> 00:37:10.169
Where's Little Bill for Christ's sake?

399
00:37:10.678 --> 00:37:12.298
Building his damn porch.

400
00:37:12.718 --> 00:37:14.378
Building his porch?

401
00:37:14.928 --> 00:37:18.298
If you gonna get shot Andy, would you
like it better on a hot day or a cold day?

402
00:37:18.598 --> 00:37:20.308
I ain't going to get shot.

403
00:37:22.268 --> 00:37:23.588
He's coming ain't he?

404
00:37:24.278 --> 00:37:26.188
Of course he's coming.

405
00:37:26.987 --> 00:37:28.397
I just loaded that, what you doing?

406
00:37:28.657 --> 00:37:31.687
I don't trust nobody to load
my guns for shooting.

407
00:37:33.287 --> 00:37:34.197
What'd he say?

408
00:37:34.657 --> 00:37:37.697
Little Bill? Didn't say nothing.
He said he was building his porch.

409
00:37:38.497 --> 00:37:41.287
- You seen that thing?
- It was all loaded.

410
00:37:41.517 --> 00:37:45.606
Jesus, Clyde, you got three pistols
and you only got one arm for Christ's sake!

411
00:37:45.726 --> 00:37:48.586
I just don't want to get killed
for lack of shooting back.

412
00:37:51.426 --> 00:37:54.426
You know he don't have a straight
angle on that whole goddamn porch!

413
00:37:54.936 --> 00:37:56.926
Or the whole house, for that matter!

414
00:37:57.306 --> 00:37:59.436
He is the worst damn carpenter.

415
00:38:00.146 --> 00:38:01.765
He didn't say nothing, huh?

416
00:38:02.645 --> 00:38:04.555
Asked what they looked
like, that's all.

417
00:38:06.195 --> 00:38:08.945
Christ maybe he's tough but he
sure ain't no carpenter.

418
00:38:09.445 --> 00:38:11.235
Maybe he ain't so tough.

419
00:38:12.445 --> 00:38:14.105
Seem like he was scared?

420
00:38:16.035 --> 00:38:18.074
Little Bill? Him scared?

421
00:38:19.374 --> 00:38:22.574
We never seen him up
against any like these ones.

422
00:38:22.874 --> 00:38:23.794
Killers.

423
00:38:25.214 --> 00:38:28.294
Little Bill come out of
Kansas and Texas, boys.

424
00:38:29.054 --> 00:38:31.094
He worked them tough towns.

425
00:38:31.424 --> 00:38:32.754
Just wondered.

426
00:38:34.763 --> 00:38:36.633
Anybody could be scared.

427
00:38:41.733 --> 00:38:43.643
Well, he wasn't scared, boys.

428
00:38:44.903 --> 00:38:46.643
He just ain't no carpenter.

429
00:38:52.612 --> 00:38:54.702
Well there's a dignity in royalty...

430
00:38:54.802 --> 00:38:58.282
...a majesty which precludes
the likelihood of assassination.

431
00:38:58.542 --> 00:39:00.082
Now if you were to point a pistol...

432
00:39:00.332 --> 00:39:03.622
...at a king or a queen,
your hands would shake as though palsied.

433
00:39:03.882 --> 00:39:06.722
I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody sir.

434
00:39:07.491 --> 00:39:09.801
Well that's a wise policy...
a wise policy...

435
00:39:10.421 --> 00:39:14.321
but if you did, I can assure you, if you did,
that the sight of royalty...

436
00:39:14.381 --> 00:39:18.891
...would cause you to dismiss all thoughts
of bloodshed and you would stand...

437
00:39:19.141 --> 00:39:20.551
...how should I put it...

438
00:39:20.811 --> 00:39:22.471
...in awe.

439
00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:30.190
Now... a President... well,
I mean... why not shoot a President?

440
00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:37.360
- Keep the change.
- Okay.

441
00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:41.369
This Strawberry Alice
person, tell me again.

442
00:39:41.629 --> 00:39:45.369
Down the street and across...
Greely's Beer Garden and Billiard Parlor.

443
00:39:45.749 --> 00:39:48.159
Just ask for Alice, say you
want a game of billiards.

444
00:39:48.419 --> 00:39:51.709
Billiards?
Even though I don't really wish to play?

445
00:39:52.009 --> 00:39:55.379
No matter. They burned the
table in '78 for firewood.

446
00:39:56.469 --> 00:39:58.048
Quite right... quite right.

447
00:39:59.348 --> 00:40:02.018
Well Mr. Beauchamp,
I think a cup of tea...

448
00:40:17.117 --> 00:40:18.367
Hello, Bob.

449
00:40:21.037 --> 00:40:23.527
Boys, this here is English Bob.

450
00:40:25.047 --> 00:40:26.957
Shit and fried eggs!

451
00:40:29.547 --> 00:40:31.046
Been a long time Bob.

452
00:40:32.386 --> 00:40:33.796
Did you run out of Chinamen?

453
00:40:34.516 --> 00:40:35.726
Little Bill?

454
00:40:36.016 --> 00:40:38.826
Well, I thought that you was um...
well I thought that you were dead.

455
00:40:39.556 --> 00:40:41.966
I see you've shaved
your chin whiskers off.

456
00:40:42.936 --> 00:40:45.976
I was tasting the soup
two hours after I ate it.

457
00:40:47.026 --> 00:40:48.895
Well actually, what I heard was that you...

458
00:40:49.155 --> 00:40:51.935
...fell off your horse, drunk, of course...

459
00:40:52.235 --> 00:40:54.815
...and that you broke your bloody neck.

460
00:40:56.365 --> 00:40:58.325
I heard that one myself, Bob.

461
00:40:58.665 --> 00:41:00.575
Hell, I even thought I was dead.

462
00:41:00.875 --> 00:41:03.445
Till I found out it was just
that I was in Nebraska.

463
00:41:05.084 --> 00:41:06.164
Who's your friend?

464
00:41:06.924 --> 00:41:08.164
W. W. Beauchamp.

465
00:41:09.424 --> 00:41:11.994
This is Little Bill Daggett.

466
00:41:12.924 --> 00:41:14.964
And friends, of course.

467
00:41:15.354 --> 00:41:18.514
Daggett? From Newton, Hays? From Abilene?

468
00:41:19.264 --> 00:41:21.013
In person.

469
00:41:22.393 --> 00:41:24.683
You work for the railroads
too Mr. Beauchamp?

470
00:41:25.373 --> 00:41:28.253
No.... I write. I write...

471
00:41:28.943 --> 00:41:29.973
Letters?

472
00:41:30.443 --> 00:41:32.193
Books, Bill. Books.

473
00:41:33.283 --> 00:41:34.363
Actually...

474
00:41:34.953 --> 00:41:36.863
...he's my biographer.

475
00:41:43.122 --> 00:41:45.532
I wouldn't do that if I were you...

476
00:41:45.822 --> 00:41:47.332
Mr. Beauchamp.

477
00:41:53.432 --> 00:41:54.881
It's only a book.

478
00:41:55.471 --> 00:41:56.501
A book, huh?

479
00:42:02.791 --> 00:42:05.041
Well I guess that means you boys can read.

480
00:42:05.481 --> 00:42:11.350
So I guess that means you saw the signs outside
of town there saying surrender your firearms.

481
00:42:13.450 --> 00:42:15.360
But like you told young Andy here...

482
00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:18.870
...you're not armed, are you Bob?

483
00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:22.070
Well, not really, Bill.

484
00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:27.080
Got a Peacemaker, but that
wouldn't worry you, would it?

485
00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:31.309
I mean if you don't see it.
Or most particularly, if you don't hear it.

486
00:42:32.179 --> 00:42:33.879
I'm afraid so, Bob.

487
00:42:34.679 --> 00:42:36.549
I don't like firearms around.

488
00:42:58.658 --> 00:43:00.458
Be very careful with it, sonny.

489
00:43:04.877 --> 00:43:06.317
Charley...

490
00:43:06.877 --> 00:43:09.717
see what kind of books
Mr. Beauchamp is packing here.

491
00:43:14.387 --> 00:43:16.297
Make sure you don't get wet.

492
00:43:23.316 --> 00:43:24.556
No shit Little Bill...

493
00:43:24.816 --> 00:43:27.726
all he's got here is writing
stuff and this here book.

494
00:43:30.486 --> 00:43:32.566
"The Duck of Death"?

495
00:43:32.826 --> 00:43:34.106
Duke.

496
00:43:35.865 --> 00:43:37.275
"The Duke", Bill.

497
00:43:40.455 --> 00:43:42.445
Well, good afternoon, gentlemen.

498
00:43:42.705 --> 00:43:44.835
I'll have that .32, Bob.

499
00:43:57.974 --> 00:43:59.634
Now, Little Bill...

500
00:44:00.354 --> 00:44:03.634
...you will leave me at
the mercy of my enemies.

501
00:44:08.403 --> 00:44:10.243
Enemies, Bob?

502
00:44:13.033 --> 00:44:15.813
You been talking about the Queen again?

503
00:44:16.863 --> 00:44:18.113
On Independence Day?

504
00:44:31.212 --> 00:44:32.962
I guess you think I'm kicking you, Bob.

505
00:44:34.682 --> 00:44:36.132
But it ain't so!

506
00:44:36.552 --> 00:44:38.432
What I'm doing is talking!

507
00:44:38.722 --> 00:44:39.632
You hear?!

508
00:44:40.222 --> 00:44:42.551
Talking to all those villains
down there in Kansas!

509
00:44:42.811 --> 00:44:45.301
And I'm talking to all those
villains in Missouri!

510
00:44:53.071 --> 00:44:54.321
And all those villains...

511
00:44:55.741 --> 00:44:57.611
...down in Cheyenne!

512
00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:05.950
And I'm telling 'em there
ain't no whore's gold!

513
00:45:11.590 --> 00:45:14.629
And even if there was, well they
wouldn't want to come looking for it...

514
00:45:15.799 --> 00:45:16.999
...anyhow!

515
00:45:46.248 --> 00:45:47.708
What are you all looking at?!

516
00:45:47.958 --> 00:45:49.807
Go on! Get outta here!

517
00:45:50.257 --> 00:45:51.507
Scoot!

518
00:45:56.637 --> 00:45:58.547
Go on, mind your own business!

519
00:46:25.085 --> 00:46:26.765
Hey, Will?

520
00:46:27.585 --> 00:46:28.965
You ever go into town?

521
00:46:30.215 --> 00:46:34.085
On occasion.
To sell a hog, pick up supplies.

522
00:46:35.675 --> 00:46:37.965
No, no... I mean, get yourself a woman
or something.

523
00:46:41.264 --> 00:46:43.474
No, I never go into town for that.

524
00:46:43.724 --> 00:46:45.604
A man like me?

525
00:46:46.644 --> 00:46:50.234
Only woman a man like me could get
is one he'd have to pay for.

526
00:46:50.904 --> 00:46:53.144
That ain't right, buying flesh.

527
00:46:54.744 --> 00:46:58.233
Claudia, rest her soul, would never
want me doing something like that...

528
00:46:58.493 --> 00:46:59.953
...me being a father and all.

529
00:47:04.003 --> 00:47:06.543
So.... you just use your hand?

530
00:47:12.552 --> 00:47:15.172
I don't miss it all that much.

531
00:47:32.591 --> 00:47:34.151
Will?!

532
00:47:35.991 --> 00:47:38.151
Goddamn!
Somebody's shooting at us!

533
00:47:39.491 --> 00:47:40.991
Did he hit you?

534
00:47:42.751 --> 00:47:45.780
Oh... no, I bumped my head
falling off my horse.

535
00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:53.000
Ain't shooting at us no more.

536
00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:57.000
Shooting way over yonder.

537
00:47:59.430 --> 00:48:01.510
What the hell's he shooting at over there?

538
00:48:02.099 --> 00:48:03.839
Beats the hell out of me.

539
00:48:07.019 --> 00:48:09.179
Don't reckon we in
somebody's field, do you?

540
00:48:09.439 --> 00:48:11.349
I didn't see nothing planted.

541
00:48:12.399 --> 00:48:13.859
Shooting at us again.

542
00:48:18.408 --> 00:48:20.818
Hell, he's shooting up
the whole horizon, Will.

543
00:48:22.038 --> 00:48:23.698
Wait! You'll mark us!

544
00:48:23.958 --> 00:48:25.198
Hey, Kid!

545
00:48:27.148 --> 00:48:29.208
Kid?!... You mean that's the Kid shooting at us?

546
00:48:29.548 --> 00:48:31.208
Hey Kid, it's me! Will Munny!

547
00:48:31.468 --> 00:48:33.788
What the hell's the Kid shooting at us for?

548
00:48:34.048 --> 00:48:35.207
Is that you?

549
00:48:38.057 --> 00:48:39.377
Yeah... yeah, it's me!

550
00:48:39.927 --> 00:48:43.047
Now don't go shooting at us
no more! You hear me?

551
00:48:43.807 --> 00:48:46.047
Who in the hell you got with you, Will?

552
00:48:47.147 --> 00:48:49.467
It's Ned Logan, my old partner!

553
00:48:49.817 --> 00:48:52.226
Now don't go shooting at us, you hear?

554
00:48:53.066 --> 00:48:55.906
We're gonna collect our horses
and come on over there.

555
00:48:56.276 --> 00:48:58.356
You ain't going to shoot, now are you?

556
00:49:00.256 --> 00:49:01.906
No... no, I ain't!

557
00:49:14.675 --> 00:49:18.805
- Chased that horse a damn mile.
- What the hell was you shooting at us for anyhow?

558
00:49:19.055 --> 00:49:21.805
- I thought you was following me.
- We was following you.

559
00:49:22.055 --> 00:49:26.554
- Like you said if I changed my mind...
- Wasn't nothing said about no partner, Will.

560
00:49:27.274 --> 00:49:29.094
Well, this here's Ned Logan.

561
00:49:29.354 --> 00:49:32.474
This is the Schofield Kid,
nephew to Pete Sothow.

562
00:49:32.734 --> 00:49:36.684
I seen two fellows following me.
My guess is you come to kill me.

563
00:49:38.204 --> 00:49:40.694
We never talked about no other fellow.

564
00:49:40.954 --> 00:49:45.333
Well, there's two of them cowboys isn't there?
Better there's three of us, in case they got friends.

565
00:49:45.583 --> 00:49:49.413
I figure I can take care of them two
cowboys myself. It don't take three.

566
00:49:50.253 --> 00:49:54.503
Ned's an awful good shot with a rifle.
Hit a bird in the eye flying.

567
00:49:55.093 --> 00:49:56.963
Better than you, anyhow Kid.

568
00:49:57.473 --> 00:49:58.752
Hell, you wasn't even coming close.

569
00:49:59.012 --> 00:50:01.502
Get your damn hands off my rifle, mister!

570
00:50:10.902 --> 00:50:14.682
Thought I'd check it for you.
Thought maybe something was bent.

571
00:50:14.942 --> 00:50:16.351
It ain't bent.

572
00:50:17.491 --> 00:50:19.361
Well you were shooting all over creation!

573
00:50:19.621 --> 00:50:21.191
You gonna share your half with him?

574
00:50:21.871 --> 00:50:23.581
I figure three ways.

575
00:50:24.791 --> 00:50:26.161
You figured wrong.

576
00:50:27.831 --> 00:50:30.291
Sorry I wasted your time, Ned.

577
00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:34.420
What? You going back with him?

578
00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:37.340
Well he's my partner.

579
00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:39.420
He don't go, I don't go.

580
00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:46.390
What's it come to, three ways?

581
00:51:40.406 --> 00:51:41.606
Shit!

582
00:51:43.246 --> 00:51:45.326
- What the hell you pissing on about?
- What?

583
00:51:47.416 --> 00:51:50.996
- What are you looking at, anyhow?
- "Looking at"?

584
00:51:51.256 --> 00:51:52.626
Clouds, Kid.

585
00:51:53.046 --> 00:51:56.875
Looking at them clouds over yonder on
account of we got a storm riding up our ass.

586
00:51:59.055 --> 00:52:01.595
Oh, them?
Hell, I seen them.

587
00:52:12.065 --> 00:52:14.474
You was smart to change your mind, Kid.

588
00:52:17.744 --> 00:52:19.984
I'm a real good shot with this rifle.

589
00:52:22.624 --> 00:52:24.164
See that hawk up there?

590
00:52:27.584 --> 00:52:29.503
I could hit that hawk with one shot.

591
00:52:33.253 --> 00:52:37.173
Hell, I could hit it too, Ned.
If I didn't mind wasting a shot.

592
00:52:39.973 --> 00:52:41.683
There ain't no hawk, Kid.

593
00:52:42.763 --> 00:52:44.673
You can't see for shit, can you?

594
00:52:47.982 --> 00:52:49.682
See your canteen?

595
00:52:56.242 --> 00:52:57.652
Alright, how far can you see?

596
00:52:57.812 --> 00:52:58.892
Far enough.

597
00:52:59.102 --> 00:53:01.492
We ain't going to Wyoming to shoot
canteens goddamn it! How far?

598
00:53:01.742 --> 00:53:03.981
- 100 yards?
- More.

599
00:53:04.241 --> 00:53:06.911
- Can you see that scrub oak yonder?
- Fuck you Ned.

600
00:53:07.161 --> 00:53:08.441
He's blind Will!

601
00:53:08.541 --> 00:53:10.201
I ain't blind you asshole!

602
00:53:10.631 --> 00:53:12.041
Now hold on! Hold it!

603
00:53:12.921 --> 00:53:15.411
How far can you see, Kid?
50 yards?

604
00:53:15.921 --> 00:53:18.761
You bet your ass
I can see 50 yards, Will.

605
00:53:19.180 --> 00:53:22.750
I can see well enough to shoot this
son-of-a-bitch right here in front of me.

606
00:53:22.850 --> 00:53:24.390
Now hold on.

607
00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:26.050
You hear that, Ned?

608
00:53:26.350 --> 00:53:28.760
Kid can see 50 yards. Fine.

609
00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:31.060
Jesus!

610
00:53:34.490 --> 00:53:37.849
50 yards'll do just fine.
Now let's move out.

611
00:53:47.249 --> 00:53:50.039
Boy, they look like real hard cases, Bob.

612
00:53:51.499 --> 00:53:53.078
Did you kill all seven of 'em dead?

613
00:53:53.338 --> 00:53:55.328
Or did you just wing some of 'em?

614
00:54:01.218 --> 00:54:04.428
Now that is you there embalmed on the cover?

615
00:54:06.728 --> 00:54:08.518
"The Duck of Death"?

616
00:54:09.937 --> 00:54:12.807
It's the Duke.
"Duke of Death."

617
00:54:16.737 --> 00:54:20.897
You always were hell in Jesus with
a pistol Bob, but seven of 'em? Boy!

618
00:54:21.157 --> 00:54:23.927
And you protecting that woman and all that.
How in the hell do you do that?

619
00:54:27.266 --> 00:54:32.206
Well, you see, it's generally considered desirable
in the publishing business to take a certain...

620
00:54:32.466 --> 00:54:35.336
...liberty when you're
depicting the cover scene.

621
00:54:35.586 --> 00:54:37.416
It's for reasons involving the marketplace, etc....

622
00:54:37.716 --> 00:54:42.176
Well, Mr. Beauchamp, from what I read, this here book
the writing's not that much different than the picture.

623
00:54:44.515 --> 00:54:46.925
Well I can assure you, Mr. Daggett...

624
00:54:47.315 --> 00:54:51.015
...that the events that are described in there
are taken from the account of eyewitnesses, sir.

625
00:54:51.275 --> 00:54:52.335
Eyewitnesses?

626
00:54:52.475 --> 00:54:53.635
Yes sir!

627
00:54:54.105 --> 00:54:55.805
You mean like the Duck himself, I guess.

628
00:54:58.115 --> 00:54:59.314
The Duke.

629
00:54:59.744 --> 00:55:01.024
Duck, I says.

630
00:55:09.624 --> 00:55:13.674
"You have insulted the honor of
this beautiful woman, Corcoran..."

631
00:55:13.924 --> 00:55:15.164
...said the Duck.

632
00:55:16.503 --> 00:55:18.413
"You must apologize."

633
00:55:18.803 --> 00:55:21.253
"But Two-Gun Corcoran
would have none of it..."

634
00:55:21.513 --> 00:55:24.933
"and cursing, he reached for his
pistols and would have killed him...

635
00:55:25.183 --> 00:55:29.763
...but the Duck was faster and hot lead
blazed from his smoking six-guns."

636
00:55:31.313 --> 00:55:34.102
See I consider that to be an
accurate depiction of the events.

637
00:55:34.362 --> 00:55:38.732
Albeit, there is a certain poetry to the
language which I couldn't resist.

638
00:55:38.952 --> 00:55:40.622
Ahh, Mr. Beauchamp...

639
00:55:41.952 --> 00:55:45.122
I was in the Blue Bottle
Saloon in Wichita...

640
00:55:45.452 --> 00:55:48.452
...the night that English Bob
killed Corky Corcoran...

641
00:55:49.162 --> 00:55:50.871
and I didn't see you there.

642
00:55:51.711 --> 00:55:53.201
Nor no woman.

643
00:55:53.461 --> 00:55:55.581
No two-gun shooters.

644
00:55:55.881 --> 00:55:58.591
- Nor none of this.
- You were there?

645
00:55:58.841 --> 00:56:00.251
Yeah, I was there.

646
00:56:02.971 --> 00:56:04.301
First off...

647
00:56:04.971 --> 00:56:08.590
...Corky never carried two guns,
though he should have.

648
00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:10.970
He was called Two-Gun Corcoran.

649
00:56:11.230 --> 00:56:15.770
Yeah, well, a lot of folks did call him Two-Gun,
but that wasn't because he was sporting two pistols.

650
00:56:16.030 --> 00:56:18.020
It was because he had dick
that was so big...

651
00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:21.700
...it was longer than the barrel
on that Walker Colt that he carried.

652
00:56:22.789 --> 00:56:27.119
And the only the only insulting he ever did
was stick that thing of his into this French lady...

653
00:56:27.269 --> 00:56:28.949
...that English Bob here was kinda sweet on.

654
00:56:29.329 --> 00:56:34.749
You see the night that Corky walked into the Blue Bottle
and before he know's what's happening...

655
00:56:35.009 --> 00:56:38.509
...Bob here takes a shot at him!
And he misses 'cause he's so damn drunk.

656
00:56:38.759 --> 00:56:42.918
Now that bullet whizzing by panicked
old Corky... and he did the wrong thing.

657
00:56:43.768 --> 00:56:46.708
He went for his gun in such a hurry
he shot his own damn toe off.

658
00:56:47.018 --> 00:56:48.848
Meantime, Bob here...

659
00:56:49.768 --> 00:56:52.438
...he's aiming real good
and he squeezes off another...

660
00:56:52.688 --> 00:56:57.647
...but he misses, cause he's still so damn drunk
and he hits a $1,000 mirror over the bar.

661
00:56:58.217 --> 00:57:01.367
But now, the Duck of Death is as good as dead...

662
00:57:01.527 --> 00:57:03.647
...because Corky does it right.

663
00:57:04.327 --> 00:57:06.037
He aims real careful.

664
00:57:06.497 --> 00:57:08.287
- No hurry.
- And?

665
00:57:10.707 --> 00:57:16.166
That Walker Colt blew up in his hand,
which was a failing common to that model.

666
00:57:16.926 --> 00:57:21.086
You see if Corky had've had two guns
instead of just a big dick...

667
00:57:22.306 --> 00:57:24.976
he would've been there right
to the end to defend himself.

668
00:57:25.306 --> 00:57:26.686
Wait a minute, you mean...

669
00:57:27.726 --> 00:57:31.595
that English Bob killed him when
he didn't even have...

670
00:57:31.935 --> 00:57:35.525
Well old Bob wasn't going to wait
for Corky to grow a new hand.

671
00:57:35.945 --> 00:57:38.695
No, he just walked
over there real slow...

672
00:57:40.195 --> 00:57:41.445
...because he was drunk...

673
00:57:43.825 --> 00:57:45.865
...and shot him right through the liver.

674
00:58:06.303 --> 00:58:08.713
Damn I don't like rocks
on my dadgum back!

675
00:58:09.643 --> 00:58:13.593
- I sure do miss my bed.
- You said that last night.

676
00:58:13.693 --> 00:58:18.193
No, last night I said I missed my wife.
Tonight I just miss my dadgum bed!

677
00:58:19.493 --> 00:58:23.042
You'll miss your dadgum roof
here in a while, I suppose.

678
00:58:24.412 --> 00:58:25.822
English shit!

679
00:58:37.401 --> 00:58:39.161
- Say, Will?
- Um-hmm?

680
00:58:40.801 --> 00:58:42.961
That business up in Jackson County...

681
00:58:43.221 --> 00:58:44.931
...that really happen?

682
00:58:45.181 --> 00:58:46.891
I mean the way they say it happened?

683
00:58:47.811 --> 00:58:48.801
What business?

684
00:58:51.521 --> 00:58:55.350
On how there's two deputies up close
pointing their rifles right at you.

685
00:58:55.610 --> 00:58:57.350
Had you dead to rights.

686
00:58:57.690 --> 00:59:00.650
You pulled out your pistol
and blew them both to hell.

687
00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:03.110
Only took a scratch yourself.

688
00:59:09.869 --> 00:59:12.409
Uncle Pete says he never
seen nothing like it...

689
00:59:12.669 --> 00:59:15.209
...shooting your way out
of a scrape like that.

690
00:59:19.339 --> 00:59:21.549
Yeah... well I don't recollect.

691
00:59:24.889 --> 00:59:26.718
You don't recollect?

692
00:59:27.558 --> 00:59:28.668
That's right.

693
00:59:30.598 --> 00:59:31.638
Say Ned...

694
00:59:34.858 --> 00:59:36.598
...how many men you killed?

695
00:59:41.408 --> 00:59:43.147
Aren't you going to answer the question?

696
00:59:43.737 --> 00:59:45.487
What the hell's that to you?

697
00:59:48.417 --> 00:59:53.207
Well I gotta know what kind of fellow I'm riding
with, in case we get into a scrape and all.

698
00:59:56.757 --> 00:59:58.717
How many men you killed, Kid?

699
00:59:59.337 --> 01:00:00.336
Five.

700
01:00:00.596 --> 01:00:01.586
How many?

701
01:00:04.386 --> 01:00:05.386
Five!

702
01:00:06.476 --> 01:00:08.546
I done killed five of them.

703
01:00:10.146 --> 01:00:13.926
That's including a Mexican.
He come after me with a knife.

704
01:00:14.186 --> 01:00:16.396
Why don't you shut up?
Get some rest.

705
01:00:17.775 --> 01:00:21.395
You boys are as crotchety as a
couple of old hens, let me tell ya.

706
01:00:23.785 --> 01:00:28.855
Actually, then, Mr. Corcoran was faster
on the draw than the Duck...

707
01:00:29.665 --> 01:00:30.905
Than English Bob?

708
01:00:31.165 --> 01:00:33.914
Faster?
Faster was his mistake.

709
01:00:34.164 --> 01:00:37.624
If he hadn't been in such a goddamned hurry, he wouldn't
have shot himself in the toe with that first shot.

710
01:00:37.884 --> 01:00:39.924
He would've killed old Bob.

711
01:00:40.784 --> 01:00:41.924
Look, son...

712
01:00:43.304 --> 01:00:46.344
Being a good shot,
being quick with a pistol...

713
01:00:46.594 --> 01:00:50.973
...that don't do no harm, but it don't
mean much next to being cool-headed.

714
01:00:51.643 --> 01:00:55.393
A man who'll keep his head,
not get rattled under fire...

715
01:00:55.983 --> 01:00:57.523
...like as not he'll kill you.

716
01:00:57.773 --> 01:01:02.523
- But if the other fellow is quicker and fires first...
- Then he'll be hurrying and he'll miss.

717
01:01:02.783 --> 01:01:04.153
Look here.

718
01:01:06.952 --> 01:01:12.162
That's about as fast as I can draw and aim
and hit anything more than 10 feet away.

719
01:01:12.542 --> 01:01:14.202
Unless it's a barn.

720
01:01:14.672 --> 01:01:16.582
But if he doesn't miss?

721
01:01:18.382 --> 01:01:19.622
Then he'll kill you.

722
01:01:23.931 --> 01:01:27.711
That's why there's so few
dangerous men around like old Bob.

723
01:01:28.521 --> 01:01:29.511
Like me.

724
01:01:30.571 --> 01:01:32.691
It ain't so easy to shoot
a man anyhow, you know

725
01:01:32.781 --> 01:01:34.491
especially if the son-of-a-bitch
is shooting back at you.

726
01:01:34.651 --> 01:01:36.801
I mean that'll just flat rattle some folks.

727
01:01:38.651 --> 01:01:40.610
Let me show you something.

728
01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:43.570
Look here.
Take that.

729
01:01:46.790 --> 01:01:48.330
Go on, take it.

730
01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:54.250
There's the key.

731
01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:57.019
All you gotta do is shoot me...

732
01:01:57.879 --> 01:02:01.699
...and you and Bob can just
ride on out of here free as birds.

733
01:02:07.019 --> 01:02:11.059
- Is it loaded?
- Wouldn't do much good if it wasn't.

734
01:02:11.309 --> 01:02:13.139
First, you got to cock it.

735
01:02:20.068 --> 01:02:21.608
Go on, cock it.

736
01:02:29.788 --> 01:02:31.447
Now you got to point it.

737
01:02:35.087 --> 01:02:36.577
Go on. Point it.

738
01:02:46.057 --> 01:02:48.756
Now all you got to do
is pull the trigger, mister.

739
01:03:03.865 --> 01:03:05.485
Hot, ain't it?

740
01:03:07.205 --> 01:03:09.575
You didn't even put your
finger on the trigger.

741
01:03:10.785 --> 01:03:12.285
What if...

742
01:03:13.545 --> 01:03:14.955
What if I gave it to him?

743
01:03:16.625 --> 01:03:17.875
Give it to him.

744
01:03:25.924 --> 01:03:27.604
...wh... you don't really want me to...

745
01:03:27.704 --> 01:03:29.204
Give it to him.

746
01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:32.860
I guess he don't want it, Mr. Beauchamp.

747
01:04:54.729 --> 01:04:56.849
You were right not to take it, Bob.

748
01:04:57.109 --> 01:04:58.519
I would have killed you.

749
01:05:17.667 --> 01:05:19.707
We could use some rain, Mr. Beauchamp.

750
01:05:30.597 --> 01:05:33.087
You no-good, goddamn pig-fucking whore!

751
01:05:34.476 --> 01:05:36.466
Sorry, old horse.

752
01:05:47.706 --> 01:05:50.655
I brung this along for when
we have to kill them fellows.

753
01:05:50.915 --> 01:05:53.115
Figured we could use some now.

754
01:05:53.375 --> 01:05:55.615
Not me. I don't touch it no more.

755
01:05:55.875 --> 01:05:59.045
- Aw, come on, Will, it's raining.
- I know it's raining!

756
01:05:59.295 --> 01:06:01.285
Give some to the Kid why don't you.

757
01:06:04.095 --> 01:06:06.765
You think that Kid
really killed five men?

758
01:06:08.264 --> 01:06:09.634
No.

759
01:06:10.874 --> 01:06:12.874
You know...

760
01:06:13.644 --> 01:06:18.774
When you were talking back there about the time
them deputies had the drop on you and Pete...

761
01:06:19.014 --> 01:06:21.014
- Yeah.
- Well...

762
01:06:21.824 --> 01:06:25.233
I remember there was
three men you shot, Will, not two.

763
01:06:25.493 --> 01:06:27.893
Well I ain't like that no more, Ned!

764
01:06:28.203 --> 01:06:30.603
I ain't no crazy killing fool.

765
01:06:33.123 --> 01:06:36.653
Still think it's gonna be
easy to kill them cowboys?

766
01:06:37.333 --> 01:06:39.623
If we don't drown first.

767
01:06:48.722 --> 01:06:51.052
Give these keys to the conductor.

768
01:06:52.102 --> 01:06:55.932
Tell him he can loose old Bob's cuffs
as soon as he's outside the county.

769
01:06:56.852 --> 01:06:58.651
Got my pistols?

770
01:07:00.861 --> 01:07:02.931
I guess you know, Bob that, uh...

771
01:07:03.241 --> 01:07:06.741
...if I see you again I'm just gonna
start shooting and figure it's self-defense.

772
01:07:13.291 --> 01:07:15.450
I didn't steal your biographer!

773
01:07:18.170 --> 01:07:20.000
He's staying on his own account!

774
01:07:20.420 --> 01:07:23.380
Well he can go stuff himself
as well, can't he?!

775
01:07:23.630 --> 01:07:26.630
A plague on ya... a plague on
the whole stinking lot of ya!

776
01:07:26.930 --> 01:07:29.000
Without morals or laws!

777
01:07:29.770 --> 01:07:33.429
And all you whores!
You got no laws, you got no honor!

778
01:07:33.979 --> 01:07:37.429
I tell you for a fact it's no
wonder you all emigrated to America!

779
01:07:37.689 --> 01:07:40.529
Because they wouldn't have you in England!

780
01:07:41.439 --> 01:07:43.479
You're a lot of savages,
that's what you all are...

781
01:07:43.739 --> 01:07:47.568
...a bunch of bloody savages!
A curse on ya!

782
01:07:49.618 --> 01:07:52.078
Nobody's going to come...

783
01:07:52.458 --> 01:07:55.488
...after what Little Bill done
to that Englishman.

784
01:07:56.838 --> 01:08:00.248
Delilah, them tables ain't clean...
can't you get 'em clean?

785
01:08:00.718 --> 01:08:03.558
and maybe if you'd cover up your face,
somebody might wanna hump with you

786
01:08:03.618 --> 01:08:05.257
and you wouldn't have to do all that cleaning.

787
01:08:06.597 --> 01:08:08.747
What do they call them things
you cover up your face with?

788
01:08:08.997 --> 01:08:10.097
A veil.

789
01:08:10.347 --> 01:08:12.177
Yeah a veil. Get a veil!

790
01:08:21.656 --> 01:08:23.396
Rain's coming.

791
01:08:24.196 --> 01:08:25.656
Thank God.

792
01:08:45.695 --> 01:08:47.695
Will?

793
01:08:50.975 --> 01:08:52.385
You sure?

794
01:09:04.534 --> 01:09:06.074
You all right there, Will?

795
01:09:16.243 --> 01:09:18.333
Hey, 's a fellow asking for you Alice.

796
01:09:18.623 --> 01:09:21.003
Tonight?
You ain't joshing?

797
01:09:21.253 --> 01:09:23.243
This way, mister.

798
01:09:23.673 --> 01:09:26.593
Must be randy as hell
to come out in this shit.

799
01:09:36.772 --> 01:09:39.772
"No, no! You're wrong,
Little Bill!" he said.

800
01:09:40.022 --> 01:09:43.312
"That's not a Curly J.
That's a Bobbed J!"

801
01:09:43.572 --> 01:09:46.441
He had changed it over.
And I said to him...

802
01:09:46.741 --> 01:09:49.771
..."Jim, you're a liar
and a horse thief!"

803
01:09:52.201 --> 01:09:56.151
Now when he saw the rest of 'em wasn't
gonna help him none, he started crying...

804
01:09:56.421 --> 01:09:58.991
...and sobbing and
just a carrying on, you know.

805
01:09:59.251 --> 01:10:02.950
He said, "Oh, Bill please oh God,
please, don't kill me, Bill!"

806
01:10:03.210 --> 01:10:06.270
So I said, "Jim, it just makes me sick..."

807
01:10:07.010 --> 01:10:08.630
Open the window, will you?

808
01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:13.140
" ...to see a man carrying
two pistols and a Henry rifle...

809
01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:15.880
...and crying like a damn baby."

810
01:10:16.150 --> 01:10:18.349
- So you killed him?
- No.

811
01:10:18.899 --> 01:10:20.359
But I should have.

812
01:10:21.439 --> 01:10:23.319
I can't abide them kind.

813
01:10:23.609 --> 01:10:25.649
You see them in the taverns, you know.

814
01:10:25.949 --> 01:10:28.189
Tramps and drunk teamsters...

815
01:10:28.619 --> 01:10:30.529
and crazed miners.

816
01:10:31.289 --> 01:10:34.698
Sporting their pistols and
acting like they were bad men.

817
01:10:35.118 --> 01:10:39.068
But without any sand or character.
Not even any bad character.

818
01:10:42.588 --> 01:10:45.758
I do not like assassins...

819
01:10:46.508 --> 01:10:48.998
or men of low character.

820
01:10:50.348 --> 01:10:52.057
Like your friend, English Bob.

821
01:10:52.727 --> 01:10:54.717
But, now Bob, he was
no coward, you know.

822
01:10:54.977 --> 01:10:58.677
No, he wouldn't come up to your
face and cry and carry on like that--

823
01:10:59.567 --> 01:11:00.597
Sheriff... I just...

824
01:11:01.947 --> 01:11:04.567
Yeah, damn. Well, I don't
have any more receptacles.

825
01:11:04.987 --> 01:11:06.977
Well, maybe you should
just hang the carpenter.

826
01:11:09.086 --> 01:11:10.576
What?

827
01:11:12.786 --> 01:11:15.906
I was just saying because of the...
You know, if you hang...

828
01:11:17.956 --> 01:11:19.236
Doesn't matter.

829
01:11:21.716 --> 01:11:23.506
What the hell?

830
01:11:24.086 --> 01:11:25.965
On a night like this!

831
01:11:27.305 --> 01:11:31.295
- Who in the hell is it?
- Deputy Charley Hecker, Bill.

832
01:11:33.085 --> 01:11:34.195
What?

833
01:11:34.895 --> 01:11:39.275
Three fellows just come into town, Bill.
They're down to Greely's.

834
01:11:39.525 --> 01:11:41.394
There's two of 'em got guns.

835
01:11:49.614 --> 01:11:52.194
What the hell's keeping that Kid?

836
01:11:53.874 --> 01:11:55.784
You don't suppose he's up...

837
01:11:57.124 --> 01:11:58.743
Jesus, Will!

838
01:11:59.083 --> 01:12:00.493
You look like shit.

839
01:12:05.133 --> 01:12:07.833
You remember Eagle Hendershot?

840
01:12:08.733 --> 01:12:09.833
Yeah.

841
01:12:12.433 --> 01:12:14.053
I saw him.

842
01:12:15.602 --> 01:12:16.972
Will, he's dead.

843
01:12:17.892 --> 01:12:19.722
No, I saw him, Ned.

844
01:12:20.562 --> 01:12:24.232
His head was all broke open.
You could see inside of it.

845
01:12:25.782 --> 01:12:28.732
Jesus! Will. You got a fever.

846
01:12:28.992 --> 01:12:32.321
- Take a drink, will you?
- Worms were coming out.

847
01:12:35.411 --> 01:12:38.531
Look, Will, I'm gonna go up
and see what's keeping the Kid.

848
01:12:38.831 --> 01:12:42.331
Must be he's getting an advance
from one of them sporting ladies.

849
01:12:44.391 --> 01:12:47.001
Will, uh... look, if I was to...

850
01:12:48.730 --> 01:12:53.150
I mean, if it worked out that I could
take a little time for myself...

851
01:12:53.330 --> 01:12:55.150
I don't suppose you would...

852
01:12:55.430 --> 01:12:57.010
I mean you wouldn't...

853
01:13:00.210 --> 01:13:02.680
Naw, I guess you wouldn't want to come.

854
01:14:25.135 --> 01:14:27.545
Give me the pistol, mister.

855
01:14:33.244 --> 01:14:35.154
I says give me over your pistol.

856
01:14:38.914 --> 01:14:40.294
I ain't drunk.

857
01:14:42.544 --> 01:14:46.363
Ordinance says you got to turn in
your firearms to the county office...

858
01:14:46.853 --> 01:14:48.393
...day or night.

859
01:14:55.223 --> 01:14:58.473
I guess you didn't see the sign,
what, with the weather and all, huh?.

860
01:15:00.563 --> 01:15:01.643
No.

861
01:15:02.982 --> 01:15:04.522
But I ain't...

862
01:15:05.272 --> 01:15:06.772
I ain't armed.

863
01:15:07.572 --> 01:15:11.022
What about your friends upstairs there?
They got any pistols?

864
01:15:14.292 --> 01:15:18.082
No, I guess...
no, they ain't armed either.

865
01:15:20.001 --> 01:15:21.541
Spilled your whiskey.

866
01:15:22.201 --> 01:15:23.541
Look, I said I...

867
01:15:23.591 --> 01:15:25.001
What's your name?

868
01:15:26.921 --> 01:15:28.171
William...

869
01:15:30.891 --> 01:15:32.051
...Hendershot.

870
01:15:35.810 --> 01:15:38.220
Well, Mr. William Hendershot...

871
01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:44.480
...what if I was to say you was a
no-good son-of-a-bitch and a liar?

872
01:15:47.070 --> 01:15:51.230
And then if I was to say that you shit in
your pants because of a cowardly soul...

873
01:15:52.369 --> 01:15:55.839
...I bet you'd show me that pistol right
quick wouldn't you, you'd shoot me dead.

874
01:15:55.999 --> 01:15:57.569
Isn't that so?

875
01:16:04.299 --> 01:16:06.459
Maybe, I guess.

876
01:16:08.179 --> 01:16:09.588
But the fact...

877
01:16:10.138 --> 01:16:13.338
...is I ain't carrying no firearm.

878
01:16:13.768 --> 01:16:15.048
Get up.

879
01:16:37.067 --> 01:16:38.147
Come on.

880
01:16:48.006 --> 01:16:50.246
What's this for, snakes and such?

881
01:16:50.766 --> 01:16:52.046
Yeah.

882
01:16:52.596 --> 01:16:55.636
We don't have any snakes in here,
Mr. Hendershot.

883
01:17:00.815 --> 01:17:05.105
It ain't loaded or...
Powder's wet?

884
01:17:08.405 --> 01:17:09.985
You see, Mr. Beauchamp?

885
01:17:13.115 --> 01:17:15.604
This is the kind of
trash I was speaking of!

886
01:17:23.334 --> 01:17:27.284
You find this kind in all the saloons
in all your prosperous communities!

887
01:17:27.554 --> 01:17:28.624
Wichita!

888
01:17:31.764 --> 01:17:33.753
Over in Cheyenne!

889
01:17:36.973 --> 01:17:38.223
Abilene!

890
01:17:42.063 --> 01:17:44.473
But you won't find them
in the town of Big Whiskey.

891
01:17:49.362 --> 01:17:52.072
Hurry up!
You know what to say to Little Bill.

892
01:17:52.322 --> 01:17:56.152
Now you guys look sharp for that lone pine.
You miss the pine, you ain't gonna find it.

893
01:17:56.412 --> 01:17:58.532
O.K. never mind the shirt, ma'am!
Put the fuck his boots on!

894
01:18:08.841 --> 01:18:11.511
What about Will?
What are we gonna do about Will?

895
01:18:11.541 --> 01:18:12.511
Come on, Kid!

896
01:18:12.681 --> 01:18:14.601
Let's hope them horses are still there!

897
01:18:49.299 --> 01:18:51.419
Let the man out, W.W.

898
01:18:52.179 --> 01:18:56.258
He's desiring to leave the hospitality
of Big Whiskey behind him.

899
01:19:29.636 --> 01:19:30.746
Easy Little Bill!
She's gotta work.

900
01:19:31.006 --> 01:19:33.006
She's got to turn a dollar a time.

901
01:19:33.206 --> 01:19:35.706
If they was just here for the fuckin'
how come they lit out the back window?

902
01:19:35.806 --> 01:19:38.296
On account of they seen you was
beating on their friend.

903
01:19:39.306 --> 01:19:41.396
They just come for the
billiards Little Bill, honest.

904
01:19:41.606 --> 01:19:42.396
Billiards?!

905
01:19:44.566 --> 01:19:46.475
What, you mean they were
just passing through here?

906
01:19:46.665 --> 01:19:48.475
They was going to Fort Buford.

907
01:19:48.735 --> 01:19:51.655
You just kicked the shit
out of an innocent man.

908
01:19:52.325 --> 01:19:53.605
Innocent?

909
01:19:53.955 --> 01:19:55.275
Innocent of what?

910
01:20:14.004 --> 01:20:16.004
- Ah, Jesus.
- Will.

911
01:20:22.653 --> 01:20:24.173
Jesus, Ned!

912
01:20:24.653 --> 01:20:26.473
You done this before?

913
01:20:27.733 --> 01:20:29.233
Plenty times.

914
01:20:30.943 --> 01:20:33.103
His pistol must've jammed.

915
01:20:35.493 --> 01:20:39.112
Here. Bring that candle in
a little closer. I can't see.

916
01:20:50.672 --> 01:20:53.461
He wouldn't've take no beating
like that if it hadn't've jammed.

917
01:20:54.851 --> 01:20:57.471
He wouldn't just give it
over and not shoot no one.

918
01:21:01.561 --> 01:21:03.271
He don't look so good.

919
01:21:05.481 --> 01:21:07.271
He didn't even pull his pistol, huh?

920
01:21:07.531 --> 01:21:09.270
Yeah, well, he ain't
as tough as you, Kid.

921
01:21:09.330 --> 01:21:11.270
Yeah, well, at least I
would've pulled my pistol, Ned.

922
01:21:11.530 --> 01:21:14.530
You did! Right out of the lady
and out the goddamn window!

923
01:21:14.780 --> 01:21:17.780
- That was your idea! I wanted to go back--
- We got to go.

924
01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:21.160
What? Already? Hey, darlin' I'm
near ready for another advance.

925
01:21:21.420 --> 01:21:23.300
You're gonna use it all up
before you even get it.

926
01:21:23.410 --> 01:21:25.000
No more advances on
what you ain't done yet.

927
01:21:25.250 --> 01:21:28.079
Hey sweetheart, we're just waiting
on the weather to clear!

928
01:21:28.119 --> 01:21:29.879
Once this weather clears up...

929
01:21:29.929 --> 01:21:33.849
We're going to need more food!
About three days' worth.

930
01:21:34.299 --> 01:21:35.709
Three days?

931
01:21:36.719 --> 01:21:38.349
Ned, we could kill 'em tomorrow.

932
01:21:38.599 --> 01:21:40.429
I don't kill nobody without him.

933
01:21:40.599 --> 01:21:42.728
We don't need him!
The two of us could do it.

934
01:21:42.978 --> 01:21:44.308
Besides...

935
01:21:44.648 --> 01:21:47.478
...he ain't nothing
but a broken-down pig farmer.

936
01:21:48.068 --> 01:21:49.568
One of us'll bring
food in the morning.

937
01:21:49.668 --> 01:21:51.268
We'll bring you some whiskey too!

938
01:21:51.528 --> 01:21:53.688
And some medicine if you got any!

939
01:21:55.288 --> 01:21:57.658
Don't it make you sick
hearing him like that?

940
01:21:57.908 --> 01:21:59.537
Hey, don't you ladies worry none!

941
01:22:00.787 --> 01:22:04.157
Me and Ned, we'll kill them two
sons of bitches for ya!

942
01:22:11.137 --> 01:22:12.547
Claudia.

943
01:22:18.436 --> 01:22:21.046
Will?... Will?

944
01:22:21.356 --> 01:22:22.986
Claudia's not here.

945
01:22:23.056 --> 01:22:24.386
Is that you, Ned?

946
01:22:26.316 --> 01:22:27.696
I seen him, Ned.

947
01:22:30.816 --> 01:22:33.025
I seen the Angel of Death.

948
01:22:33.655 --> 01:22:36.145
I seen a river, Ned.

949
01:22:37.115 --> 01:22:38.365
He's got snake eyes.

950
01:22:38.515 --> 01:22:41.365
Who Will?
Who's got snake eyes?

951
01:22:41.835 --> 01:22:43.655
It's the Angel of Death.

952
01:22:45.405 --> 01:22:47.035
Oh, Ned! Oh, Ned!

953
01:22:48.005 --> 01:22:49.834
I'm scared of dying.

954
01:22:50.504 --> 01:22:52.254
Easy, partner. Easy.

955
01:22:52.884 --> 01:22:54.754
I seen Claudia too.

956
01:22:55.634 --> 01:22:58.884
That's good, Will!
That's good you saw Claudia, ain't it?

957
01:22:59.394 --> 01:23:01.884
Her face was all covered with worms.

958
01:23:02.854 --> 01:23:04.434
Oh Ned, I'm scared.

959
01:23:05.694 --> 01:23:07.103
I'm dying.

960
01:23:12.323 --> 01:23:14.113
No, don't tell nobody.

961
01:23:14.573 --> 01:23:16.483
Don't tell my kids...

962
01:23:17.073 --> 01:23:19.653
...none of the things I done.
You hear me?

963
01:23:21.663 --> 01:23:23.042
All right, Will.

964
01:23:40.431 --> 01:23:42.311
He's gonna die, ain't he?

965
01:23:43.811 --> 01:23:45.191
Maybe.

966
01:23:45.611 --> 01:23:47.761
Well, supposing he does?

967
01:23:51.571 --> 01:23:52.941
We'll bury him.

968
01:23:53.241 --> 01:23:55.061
That ain't what I mean, Ned.

969
01:23:58.790 --> 01:24:01.320
You mean will I help
you kill them cowboys?

970
01:24:03.420 --> 01:24:05.460
Well, I can't spot them myself.

971
01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:07.410
But you could.

972
01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:12.130
That big bastard, you could spot him
a half-mile off, I bet.

973
01:24:13.589 --> 01:24:15.219
And if I spot him?

974
01:24:16.469 --> 01:24:18.959
Well then I ride up close and shoot him.

975
01:24:21.939 --> 01:24:23.179
Just like that?

976
01:24:23.649 --> 01:24:26.219
I told ya, I'm a damn killer.
I done it before.

977
01:24:29.279 --> 01:24:31.478
I'm more of a killer
than he is anyhow.

978
01:24:33.658 --> 01:24:34.798
Yeah?

979
01:24:37.058 --> 01:24:38.198
Yeah.

980
01:25:01.267 --> 01:25:03.056
I thought you was an angel.

981
01:25:05.226 --> 01:25:06.776
You ain't dead.

982
01:25:08.516 --> 01:25:09.216
No.

983
01:25:15.116 --> 01:25:16.696
Some big fellow he...

984
01:25:17.826 --> 01:25:19.905
...he really kicked the hell out of me.

985
01:25:22.785 --> 01:25:25.035
I must look kinda like you now.

986
01:25:27.125 --> 01:25:29.365
You don't look nothing like me, mister.

987
01:25:31.295 --> 01:25:32.925
No offense meant.

988
01:25:35.765 --> 01:25:38.384
You got to be the one
those cowboys cut up.

989
01:25:45.184 --> 01:25:47.764
My partners, Ned and that Kid...

990
01:25:48.314 --> 01:25:49.264
...they around?

991
01:25:50.824 --> 01:25:53.903
They went out scouting when
they saw your fever broke.

992
01:25:54.863 --> 01:25:55.943
Scouting?

993
01:25:56.863 --> 01:25:58.773
Out to the Bar T...

994
01:25:59.163 --> 01:26:01.073
...looking for them.

995
01:26:05.163 --> 01:26:06.963
How long I been here?

996
01:26:08.173 --> 01:26:09.583
Three days.

997
01:26:11.172 --> 01:26:12.792
Are you hungry or...

998
01:26:13.512 --> 01:26:15.302
Three days?

999
01:26:15.552 --> 01:26:17.092
I ought to be...

1000
01:26:29.401 --> 01:26:31.771
I thought I was gone.

1001
01:26:34.361 --> 01:26:38.491
I wouldn't normally pay no notice
to high country like this...

1002
01:26:39.331 --> 01:26:41.861
...trees,
but I'm sure noticing now.

1003
01:26:42.871 --> 01:26:45.360
I thought I was dying for sure.

1004
01:26:47.210 --> 01:26:48.830
I brought your hat.

1005
01:26:49.170 --> 01:26:51.740
You left it down at Greely's.

1006
01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:53.700
Thanks.

1007
01:26:55.590 --> 01:26:56.970
That sheriff...

1008
01:26:58.220 --> 01:27:00.969
- He still looking for me?
- Little Bill?

1009
01:27:01.229 --> 01:27:03.979
No, he thinks you went South.

1010
01:27:07.229 --> 01:27:10.099
Are you really going
to kill them cowboys?

1011
01:27:11.239 --> 01:27:12.519
I guess.

1012
01:27:13.359 --> 01:27:15.819
Still a payment coming, isn't there?

1013
01:27:17.408 --> 01:27:20.158
Them other two, your friends...

1014
01:27:20.708 --> 01:27:23.788
...they been taking
advances on the payment.

1015
01:27:24.578 --> 01:27:25.988
Advances?

1016
01:27:27.958 --> 01:27:29.508
Free ones.

1017
01:27:29.958 --> 01:27:31.408
Free ones?

1018
01:27:31.968 --> 01:27:34.837
Alice and Silky been
giving them free ones.

1019
01:27:36.557 --> 01:27:38.007
Hmm, I see.

1020
01:27:41.767 --> 01:27:43.847
Would you like a free one?

1021
01:27:53.416 --> 01:27:55.396
No I... I guess not.

1022
01:27:56.196 --> 01:27:59.866
I didn't mean with me.
I meant...

1023
01:28:00.116 --> 01:28:04.666
...Alice and Silky would be happy
to give you a free one if you wanted one.

1024
01:28:04.996 --> 01:28:07.205
That's all I meant.

1025
01:28:08.585 --> 01:28:10.995
I didn't mean I...

1026
01:28:11.255 --> 01:28:15.335
...I didn't want a free one on
account of you been cut up and all.

1027
01:28:16.305 --> 01:28:19.925
What I said the other day about
you looking like me, that ain't true.

1028
01:28:20.645 --> 01:28:22.515
You ain't ugly like me.

1029
01:28:23.934 --> 01:28:27.434
It's just that we both got scars.

1030
01:28:29.604 --> 01:28:33.104
But you're a beautiful woman
and if I was to want a free one...

1031
01:28:33.284 --> 01:28:37.024
...I'd want it with you I
guess more than them other two.

1032
01:28:39.364 --> 01:28:40.743
It's just that I...

1033
01:28:41.493 --> 01:28:43.903
...I can't on account of my wife.

1034
01:28:50.503 --> 01:28:51.753
Your wife?

1035
01:28:52.403 --> 01:28:54.753
Yeah... you see...

1036
01:29:00.892 --> 01:29:02.682
I admire you for that.

1037
01:29:03.392 --> 01:29:05.802
For being true to your wife and all.

1038
01:29:06.852 --> 01:29:08.982
I've known a lot of men...

1039
01:29:11.232 --> 01:29:12.642
...who weren't.

1040
01:29:14.931 --> 01:29:16.791
Yeah, I suppose.

1041
01:29:23.001 --> 01:29:24.791
Is she back in Kansas?

1042
01:29:26.711 --> 01:29:27.951
Yeah.

1043
01:29:29.001 --> 01:29:31.670
Yeah, she's watching over my young ones.

1044
01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:37.870
Hang on Slim! Hang on.

1045
01:29:38.140 --> 01:29:40.010
Get the damn iron! Hold it!

1046
01:29:40.940 --> 01:29:44.010
Davey! Come on Davey-boy!
Come on Davey!

1047
01:29:49.819 --> 01:29:51.609
Jesus, fella!

1048
01:30:03.539 --> 01:30:05.698
Jesus, boys, my leg's broke!

1049
01:30:07.748 --> 01:30:09.328
I'm pinned, boys!

1050
01:30:10.758 --> 01:30:12.378
Better finish him, Ned.

1051
01:30:12.798 --> 01:30:14.958
He ain't dead? You didn't get him?

1052
01:30:15.218 --> 01:30:17.128
He got the boy's horse.

1053
01:30:17.808 --> 01:30:20.178
Better finish him before he gets clear.

1054
01:30:22.977 --> 01:30:24.847
Get behind them rocks, Davey-boy.

1055
01:30:25.307 --> 01:30:26.887
Get over there, Davey!

1056
01:30:30.147 --> 01:30:32.897
What happened?
He ain't killed?!

1057
01:30:33.447 --> 01:30:34.397
What's going on?

1058
01:30:34.777 --> 01:30:37.236
He gets in those rocks,
we ain't gonna get him.

1059
01:30:37.616 --> 01:30:40.066
- Unless we go down there.
- What rocks?

1060
01:30:40.456 --> 01:30:43.236
Why don't you shoot?
What's going on, Ned?

1061
01:30:47.906 --> 01:30:49.536
Well ain't you gonna shoot?!

1062
01:30:53.006 --> 01:30:54.535
Will?

1063
01:31:02.845 --> 01:31:05.225
I ain't very good with one of these.

1064
01:31:10.854 --> 01:31:13.264
Keep going, Davey!
The rocks! Keep going!

1065
01:31:15.484 --> 01:31:16.814
Did you get him?

1066
01:31:17.654 --> 01:31:18.904
Will, where is he?

1067
01:31:19.204 --> 01:31:21.404
How many more shots do I have?

1068
01:31:23.374 --> 01:31:26.244
Ned, goddamn it!
How many more shots do I have?

1069
01:31:29.333 --> 01:31:30.363
Two.

1070
01:31:42.643 --> 01:31:44.102
Did you get him?

1071
01:32:01.411 --> 01:32:03.321
Here, reload this.

1072
01:32:04.541 --> 01:32:06.821
- You missed him.
- I got him.

1073
01:32:10.881 --> 01:32:12.161
He ain't killed.

1074
01:32:12.881 --> 01:32:14.621
Maybe, maybe not.

1075
01:32:15.261 --> 01:32:17.330
Got him through the gut, I think.

1076
01:32:21.890 --> 01:32:23.510
You think he's gonna die?

1077
01:32:25.940 --> 01:32:27.180
You think we killed him?

1078
01:32:29.420 --> 01:32:31.420
He shot me, boys.

1079
01:32:35.319 --> 01:32:36.699
Yeah.

1080
01:32:37.949 --> 01:32:41.279
We killed him, I guess.

1081
01:32:44.909 --> 01:32:46.819
I'm dying, boys!

1082
01:32:47.539 --> 01:32:51.038
Well then you shouldn't have
cut up no woman, you asshole!

1083
01:32:56.798 --> 01:32:59.468
Jesus, I'm so thirsty!

1084
01:33:00.178 --> 01:33:01.518
Slim!

1085
01:33:02.178 --> 01:33:05.518
Slim, give me some water, please!

1086
01:33:05.938 --> 01:33:07.178
Please, Slim!

1087
01:33:08.437 --> 01:33:10.057
I'm bleeding, Slim!

1088
01:33:12.197 --> 01:33:14.197
Give me some water, please.

1089
01:33:14.317 --> 01:33:17.027
Give him a drink of water,
goddamn it!

1090
01:33:17.867 --> 01:33:19.867
Give me a drink of water, would you, Slim.

1091
01:33:21.157 --> 01:33:25.206
Will you give him a drink of water,
for Christ's sake! We ain't gonna shoot!

1092
01:33:27.246 --> 01:33:28.576
You ain't gonna shoot?

1093
01:33:29.146 --> 01:33:30.276
No!

1094
01:33:32.666 --> 01:33:34.376
Hold on, Davey-boy!

1095
01:33:35.636 --> 01:33:37.086
Here I come now!

1096
01:33:43.645 --> 01:33:45.595
Don't shoot me, you bastards!

1097
01:33:47.285 --> 01:33:48.535
Davey!

1098
01:33:49.185 --> 01:33:50.435
Shit!

1099
01:33:57.684 --> 01:33:58.834
Davey!

1100
01:34:00.364 --> 01:34:01.944
They take him water?

1101
01:34:02.464 --> 01:34:03.644
Yeah.

1102
01:34:04.704 --> 01:34:06.944
Jesus, Johnny! They shot him!

1103
01:34:07.204 --> 01:34:08.784
Davey, hold on now!

1104
01:34:17.553 --> 01:34:21.083
You murdering bastards!
You killed our Davey-boy!

1105
01:34:30.023 --> 01:34:31.892
When we gonna double back?

1106
01:34:32.562 --> 01:34:34.312
After a ways.

1107
01:34:35.692 --> 01:34:36.942
Not me.

1108
01:34:37.742 --> 01:34:39.232
I'm heading on back down to Kansas.

1109
01:34:39.642 --> 01:34:42.232
We got to kill the other one first.

1110
01:34:43.242 --> 01:34:47.242
Look, Ned, with any luck, we'll find him
by nightfall or in the morning.

1111
01:34:47.502 --> 01:34:50.411
Then we can shoot him and
head on back with the money.

1112
01:34:52.541 --> 01:34:55.751
- You want the Spencer, Will?
- This ain't no time to quit, Ned.

1113
01:34:56.011 --> 01:34:58.461
- You know you're gonna lose your share Ned.
- Shut up!

1114
01:34:58.761 --> 01:35:01.461
I'll see you, Will.
So long, Kid.

1115
01:35:02.901 --> 01:35:04.171
Ned!

1116
01:35:09.300 --> 01:35:10.270
Here.

1117
01:35:10.900 --> 01:35:13.570
I ain't no good with that damn thing anyhow.

1118
01:35:14.070 --> 01:35:18.780
Look... me and the Kid'll head over
to that ranch and we find him we'll shoot him.

1119
01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:22.939
Then we'll meet up with you and pick up
our money and all head South together.

1120
01:35:23.739 --> 01:35:26.199
Well, supposing he don't go
back to the ranch, Will?

1121
01:35:26.579 --> 01:35:30.579
Well he ain't gonna go into town, I figure
he won't stay out in the open country.

1122
01:35:30.919 --> 01:35:32.879
No, he'll hole up at that ranch.

1123
01:35:34.759 --> 01:35:36.209
Well I ain't waiting.

1124
01:35:36.759 --> 01:35:39.328
I'll look in on your
young ones when I get back.

1125
01:35:43.098 --> 01:35:44.288
Hey, Ned!

1126
01:35:46.098 --> 01:35:48.888
Don't pay no attention to what the
Kid said about the money and all.

1127
01:35:49.148 --> 01:35:50.388
I'll bring your share.

1128
01:35:54.647 --> 01:35:56.227
Kid's full of shit.

1129
01:36:14.936 --> 01:36:15.936
Little Bill?

1130
01:36:17.136 --> 01:36:18.136
Little Bill?

1131
01:36:24.436 --> 01:36:26.636
Just doing some repairs up here.

1132
01:36:27.016 --> 01:36:28.845
They killed one of them cowboys.

1133
01:36:32.945 --> 01:36:34.185
Shit!

1134
01:36:35.695 --> 01:36:40.235
Parsons said how he seen three men,
right after sunup, headed out East.

1135
01:36:40.495 --> 01:36:44.954
And one was on a dun and another
was on a flea-bitten grey.

1136
01:36:45.234 --> 01:36:47.484
Only he didn't know what
the third one was on,

1137
01:36:47.554 --> 01:36:49.784
could have been an Appaloosa 'cause
he was looking right into the sun.

1138
01:36:50.044 --> 01:36:54.124
Bill, Amos says to ask you if the county's
gonna pay for feed for all the horses or not.

1139
01:36:54.384 --> 01:36:57.664
Witherspoon says he won't sell us
no more 30-30 shells without we pay.

1140
01:36:57.924 --> 01:36:59.544
Hell, use my dogs!

1141
01:36:59.804 --> 01:37:02.043
Then the county's got to take responsibility.

1142
01:37:02.333 --> 01:37:04.473
Don't worry about them horses now...

1143
01:37:04.633 --> 01:37:07.473
you just get on out there to the Bar T
and make sure that other cowboy...

1144
01:37:07.723 --> 01:37:10.303
- stays put and don't expose himself, hear?
- All right.

1145
01:37:20.322 --> 01:37:22.652
I didn't think they'd really do it.

1146
01:37:23.282 --> 01:37:26.152
Did you think they come clear
up from Kansas to fuck us?

1147
01:37:28.842 --> 01:37:32.912
No, but... that Kid, he's
just a boy and the other one...

1148
01:37:33.172 --> 01:37:36.041
...Will, the nice one, being
so true to his wife and all...

1149
01:37:36.301 --> 01:37:38.831
Wife?
He ain't got no wife.

1150
01:37:39.341 --> 01:37:42.181
- Oh yes, he does. He--
- I told ya, he ain't got no wife.

1151
01:37:42.681 --> 01:37:44.501
Not above ground, anyways.

1152
01:37:50.601 --> 01:37:52.010
Murdering whores!

1153
01:37:53.190 --> 01:37:54.680
He had it coming!

1154
01:37:55.030 --> 01:37:56.600
He had it coming for what he done.

1155
01:37:56.940 --> 01:37:58.270
And the other one too!

1156
01:37:58.530 --> 01:38:00.770
Both of them for what they done!

1157
01:38:10.959 --> 01:38:12.369
We got one!

1158
01:38:14.799 --> 01:38:17.469
We got one, Sheriff!
Out by Cow Creek!

1159
01:38:17.799 --> 01:38:20.169
- Is he alive?
- Hell, yeah!

1160
01:38:20.429 --> 01:38:25.048
Bunch of us boys from Bar T went out looking
on account of them killing one of our own.

1161
01:38:25.388 --> 01:38:28.558
Come across the son-of-a-bitch
on a roan heading South.

1162
01:38:28.898 --> 01:38:30.138
Did he admit it?

1163
01:38:30.478 --> 01:38:34.558
No. But I guess he will soon enough.
Had a Spencer rifle on him.

1164
01:38:35.318 --> 01:38:36.808
Those cowboys messed him up?

1165
01:38:38.408 --> 01:38:39.898
A little bit I guess.

1166
01:38:41.777 --> 01:38:43.177
Alright. Find Andy.

1167
01:38:43.577 --> 01:38:47.577
Get on out there. See if you can find out
what happened to those other two fellas!

1168
01:39:10.686 --> 01:39:12.846
You see anything out there, Buck?

1169
01:39:13.106 --> 01:39:16.935
Hell, yes I did!
Seen about 200 fellas packing rifles.

1170
01:39:17.195 --> 01:39:21.485
Got the place surrounded.
Say they want Quick Mike's ass.

1171
01:39:21.735 --> 01:39:25.025
I said, "How much?" They says,
"About five." I said, "Dollars?"

1172
01:39:25.285 --> 01:39:26.535
They said, "Cents."

1173
01:39:26.785 --> 01:39:28.285
I said, "Sold."

1174
01:39:29.955 --> 01:39:31.614
Well, I ain't worried!

1175
01:39:31.954 --> 01:39:34.204
Because I got me some protection.

1176
01:39:59.983 --> 01:40:01.893
- Tell you where them others is?
- Nope.

1177
01:40:02.153 --> 01:40:03.233
Give 'em any names?

1178
01:40:03.573 --> 01:40:06.242
Didn't tell us nothing but
his own name, Ned Roundtree.

1179
01:40:08.832 --> 01:40:10.072
Bring him in.

1180
01:40:10.682 --> 01:40:12.022
Well Ned...

1181
01:40:13.082 --> 01:40:15.922
you'll want to tell me
and Mr. Beauchamp here...

1182
01:40:16.672 --> 01:40:18.912
all about your two
villainous friends I guess.

1183
01:40:19.552 --> 01:40:23.711
I'll be glad to hear the names and
whereabouts of those murderous son-of-a-bitches.

1184
01:40:38.570 --> 01:40:40.190
Sure is ripe.

1185
01:40:40.530 --> 01:40:41.159
Yeah.

1186
01:40:41.860 --> 01:40:43.690
Going to get a lot riper.

1187
01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:46.690
You think he's still in there?

1188
01:40:47.890 --> 01:40:49.530
Yeah, he's in there.

1189
01:40:50.790 --> 01:40:53.870
Yeah, well he's holding on to
his shit like it was money.

1190
01:40:54.790 --> 01:40:56.199
He's in there.

1191
01:40:56.709 --> 01:40:58.869
You tell me right off if you see him.

1192
01:40:59.299 --> 01:41:00.279
Yeah.

1193
01:41:01.299 --> 01:41:03.379
Ain't gonna shoot him
your own self, are you?

1194
01:41:03.889 --> 01:41:05.379
You can shoot him.

1195
01:41:43.217 --> 01:41:46.256
Now Ned... you and Mr. Quincy and...

1196
01:41:46.516 --> 01:41:48.456
What was the young fella's name?

1197
01:41:50.726 --> 01:41:51.606
Elroy...

1198
01:41:52.526 --> 01:41:54.306
Elroy Tate.

1199
01:41:59.196 --> 01:42:01.516
No... No, that's not what you said.

1200
01:42:01.985 --> 01:42:03.015
Hell if it ain't!

1201
01:42:03.365 --> 01:42:04.945
No, you said...

1202
01:42:05.535 --> 01:42:08.285
"Elroy Quincy out of Medicine Hat and...

1203
01:42:10.035 --> 01:42:12.785
Henry Tate out of Cheyenne."

1204
01:42:13.295 --> 01:42:14.705
Hell if I did.

1205
01:42:15.715 --> 01:42:17.125
Hell if I did.

1206
01:42:17.345 --> 01:42:18.674
Charley...

1207
01:42:19.344 --> 01:42:22.674
Go and get them whores what fucked
these boys the night of the storm.

1208
01:42:22.924 --> 01:42:24.964
Strawberry Alice and Silky?

1209
01:42:25.304 --> 01:42:26.964
Yeah! Go on. Get 'em! Go on.

1210
01:42:33.024 --> 01:42:34.234
Now Ned...

1211
01:42:36.023 --> 01:42:40.233
Them whores are going to tell
different lies than you.

1212
01:42:41.483 --> 01:42:45.023
And when their lies
ain't the same as your lies...

1213
01:42:46.993 --> 01:42:49.203
well I ain't going to hurt no woman.

1214
01:42:50.333 --> 01:42:52.282
But I'm going to hurt you.

1215
01:42:54.752 --> 01:42:56.912
Not gentle like before...

1216
01:42:58.462 --> 01:42:59.792
...but bad.

1217
01:43:16.481 --> 01:43:17.731
Where you going?

1218
01:43:18.021 --> 01:43:20.271
- Goin out to the shithouse.
- Well let me finish this hand will ya?

1219
01:43:20.531 --> 01:43:22.771
What are you gonna protect
me while I take a dump?

1220
01:43:23.031 --> 01:43:25.191
- You're gonna get bushwhacked.
- I'll fart on them.

1221
01:43:25.450 --> 01:43:28.620
- I'll go with ya.
- Yeah, you can wipe my ass, Thirsty.

1222
01:43:28.870 --> 01:43:32.150
Hell with him, you know.
The man ain't polite, he oughta get shot.

1223
01:43:36.210 --> 01:43:37.540
Is that him?

1224
01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:39.290
Yeah, that's him.

1225
01:43:43.219 --> 01:43:46.049
All right, Kid. Go get him.
He's all yours.

1226
01:44:22.597 --> 01:44:23.707
Assassins!

1227
01:44:27.637 --> 01:44:28.967
Shoot him!

1228
01:44:44.736 --> 01:44:46.286
Come on, goddamn it!

1229
01:45:03.385 --> 01:45:04.795
Did you get him?

1230
01:45:05.085 --> 01:45:06.394
Yeah.

1231
01:45:17.354 --> 01:45:18.634
Cover me.

1232
01:45:21.324 --> 01:45:23.693
- I can't see 'em!
- Just shoot damn ya!

1233
01:46:00.781 --> 01:46:03.351
Was that what it was like in
the old days Will?

1234
01:46:04.031 --> 01:46:06.571
Everybody riding out, shooting...

1235
01:46:07.031 --> 01:46:10.951
...smoke all over the place, folks
yelling, bullets whizzing by?

1236
01:46:12.790 --> 01:46:14.120
I guess so.

1237
01:46:18.210 --> 01:46:20.700
Shit, I thought they's gonna get us.

1238
01:46:21.880 --> 01:46:23.870
I was even scared a little.

1239
01:46:24.220 --> 01:46:25.460
Just for a minute.

1240
01:46:28.220 --> 01:46:30.209
Was you ever scared in them days?

1241
01:46:32.479 --> 01:46:33.889
I can't remember.

1242
01:46:35.229 --> 01:46:37.389
I was drunk most of the time.

1243
01:46:44.159 --> 01:46:46.728
I shot that fucker three times!

1244
01:46:48.238 --> 01:46:51.778
He was taking a shit, he went
for his pistol and I blazed away.

1245
01:46:52.328 --> 01:46:53.708
First shot...

1246
01:46:55.498 --> 01:46:57.158
...I got him right in the chest.

1247
01:47:01.298 --> 01:47:02.657
Say, Will.

1248
01:47:03.597 --> 01:47:04.557
Yeah?

1249
01:47:06.927 --> 01:47:08.387
That was the first one.

1250
01:47:09.927 --> 01:47:11.377
First one what?

1251
01:47:13.687 --> 01:47:15.507
First one I ever killed.

1252
01:47:17.067 --> 01:47:18.147
Yeah?

1253
01:47:19.526 --> 01:47:21.936
You know how I said I shot five men?

1254
01:47:23.366 --> 01:47:24.936
It weren't true.

1255
01:47:27.366 --> 01:47:29.526
That Mexican who come at me
with the knife?

1256
01:47:30.866 --> 01:47:35.286
I just busted his leg with a shovel.
I didn't kill him or nothing neither.

1257
01:47:38.505 --> 01:47:41.705
Well you sure killed the
hell out of that fellow today.

1258
01:47:43.675 --> 01:47:45.255
Hell, yeah!

1259
01:47:48.725 --> 01:47:51.095
I killed the hell out of him, didn't I?

1260
01:47:51.975 --> 01:47:55.014
Three shots and he was taking a shit.

1261
01:48:01.564 --> 01:48:02.944
Take a drink, Kid.

1262
01:48:13.833 --> 01:48:15.703
Jesus Christ!

1263
01:48:28.182 --> 01:48:30.052
It don't seem real.

1264
01:48:31.602 --> 01:48:34.722
How he ain't gonna never
breath again, ever.

1265
01:48:35.692 --> 01:48:37.012
How he's dead.

1266
01:48:38.862 --> 01:48:40.352
And the other one too.

1267
01:48:43.241 --> 01:48:45.481
All on account of pullin' a trigger.

1268
01:48:48.451 --> 01:48:51.091
It's a hell of a thing, killin' a man.

1269
01:48:52.851 --> 01:48:54.791
You take away all he's got...

1270
01:48:55.761 --> 01:48:57.971
...and all he's ever gonna have.

1271
01:49:01.130 --> 01:49:02.220
Yeah.

1272
01:49:03.630 --> 01:49:05.620
Well I guess they had it coming.

1273
01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:13.880
We all have it coming, Kid.

1274
01:49:28.489 --> 01:49:31.409
I was watching ya, seeing
that you weren't followed.

1275
01:49:32.828 --> 01:49:37.288
Silky and Faith they rode off to the East
and two deputies was following them.

1276
01:49:42.258 --> 01:49:45.188
Here... You wanna help me
count this stuff Kid?

1277
01:49:45.408 --> 01:49:47.388
I trust you Will.

1278
01:49:47.558 --> 01:49:50.157
Well don't go trusting me too much.

1279
01:49:50.847 --> 01:49:54.277
In fact, we'll give Ned
his share together.

1280
01:49:54.437 --> 01:49:57.057
That way you'll know I ain't
holding out on you.

1281
01:49:57.317 --> 01:49:58.557
Ned's share?

1282
01:50:00.447 --> 01:50:03.687
Yeah. He went South.
We'll catch up to him.

1283
01:50:04.447 --> 01:50:06.236
Ned... He's dead.

1284
01:50:09.616 --> 01:50:11.246
What do you mean, he's dead?

1285
01:50:12.286 --> 01:50:15.156
He went South yesterday.
He ain't dead.

1286
01:50:15.706 --> 01:50:18.276
They...they killed him.
I...I thought you knew that.

1287
01:50:18.546 --> 01:50:20.456
Nobody killed Ned!

1288
01:50:20.716 --> 01:50:23.205
He didn't kill anyone.
He went South yesterday!

1289
01:50:23.585 --> 01:50:25.665
Why would anybody kill Ned?

1290
01:50:28.265 --> 01:50:29.505
Who killed him?

1291
01:50:30.305 --> 01:50:31.555
Li...Little Bill.

1292
01:50:31.895 --> 01:50:33.985
The Bar T boys caught him...

1293
01:50:34.055 --> 01:50:36.685
...and Little Bill...
he beat him up.

1294
01:50:36.935 --> 01:50:41.764
He was making him answer questions,
and beating him up and then Ned just died.

1295
01:50:42.234 --> 01:50:44.694
They got a sign on him
says he was a killer.

1296
01:50:44.944 --> 01:50:46.404
They got a sign on him?

1297
01:50:47.154 --> 01:50:48.734
In front of Greely's.

1298
01:50:48.994 --> 01:50:51.154
A sign on him in front of Greely's!

1299
01:50:55.744 --> 01:50:58.073
These questions Little Bill was asking...

1300
01:50:59.213 --> 01:51:00.583
...what kind were they?

1301
01:51:04.803 --> 01:51:07.593
About where you and him was.

1302
01:51:08.013 --> 01:51:09.253
Then what?

1303
01:51:10.343 --> 01:51:14.672
A cowboy come in saying you killed
Quick Mike in the shithouse at the Bar T.

1304
01:51:15.682 --> 01:51:18.552
So Little Bill killed him
for what we done, huh?

1305
01:51:18.712 --> 01:51:20.162
Not on purpose.

1306
01:51:21.112 --> 01:51:23.102
But he started hurting him worse.

1307
01:51:23.362 --> 01:51:25.102
Making him tell stuff.

1308
01:51:25.442 --> 01:51:27.052
First, Ned wouldn't say nothing.

1309
01:51:27.782 --> 01:51:31.531
...and then Little Bill hurt him
so bad, he said who you was.

1310
01:51:33.621 --> 01:51:37.041
He said how you was really
William Munny out of Missouri.

1311
01:51:37.871 --> 01:51:40.911
...and Little Bill said, "The same
William Munny that dynamited the

1312
01:51:41.171 --> 01:51:44.371
...Rock Island & Pacific in '69,
killing women and children and all?"

1313
01:51:44.631 --> 01:51:47.800
...and Ned said you done a lot worse
than that. Said you was...

1314
01:51:48.050 --> 01:51:51.720
...more cold-blooded than William Bonney
and how if he hurt Ned again...

1315
01:51:51.970 --> 01:51:57.130
...you was gonna come kill him
like you killed the U.S. Marshal in '70.

1316
01:52:01.820 --> 01:52:03.979
That didn't scare Little Bill, did it?

1317
01:52:05.989 --> 01:52:07.229
No, sir.

1318
01:52:15.249 --> 01:52:17.069
Give me your Schofield.

1319
01:52:17.329 --> 01:52:18.529
What for Will?

1320
01:52:18.789 --> 01:52:19.789
Give it to me.

1321
01:52:20.988 --> 01:52:22.588
Yeah. Sure.

1322
01:52:27.058 --> 01:52:29.048
You go on, keep it.

1323
01:52:29.308 --> 01:52:30.978
I'm never gonna use it again.

1324
01:52:33.268 --> 01:52:35.338
I won't kill nobody no more.

1325
01:52:38.937 --> 01:52:40.567
I ain't like you, Will.

1326
01:52:44.607 --> 01:52:46.517
You better ride on back, Miss.

1327
01:52:51.287 --> 01:52:53.856
Go on, keep it...all of it.
It's yours.

1328
01:52:54.746 --> 01:52:57.616
What about the spectacles
and the fancy clothes?

1329
01:52:58.706 --> 01:53:01.906
I guess I'd rather be blind
and ragged than dead.

1330
01:53:02.986 --> 01:53:07.136
You don't have to worry, Kid.
I ain't going to kill you.

1331
01:53:07.556 --> 01:53:09.626
You're the only friend I got.

1332
01:53:17.065 --> 01:53:22.105
Here, take this money and give my half
and Ned's half to my kids.

1333
01:53:22.695 --> 01:53:26.225
Tell them if I ain't back in a week,
they give half to Sally Two Trees.

1334
01:53:26.485 --> 01:53:29.194
You can keep the rest.
You can get them spectacles now.

1335
01:53:29.444 --> 01:53:31.194
You're gonna kill Little Bill ain’t ya?

1336
01:53:31.664 --> 01:53:35.744
You stay clear of folks you see.
There'll be a lot of 'em out to hang you.

1337
01:53:36.334 --> 01:53:37.614
Get going.

1338
01:54:21.421 --> 01:54:25.251
Alright I'm gonna say this just one more time,
to make it clear, so don't ask me again!

1339
01:54:25.841 --> 01:54:30.131
Those of you on the posse today got one
drink coming from the county budget!

1340
01:54:32.471 --> 01:54:35.760
And those of you who rode yesterday
get one drink for that too.

1341
01:54:37.060 --> 01:54:38.600
Alright hold it! Now hold it.

1342
01:54:38.850 --> 01:54:43.310
Now that's two! But after that, it comes out
of your own pocket! Do you hear me Skinny?

1343
01:54:43.570 --> 01:54:46.600
- Yes, sir.
- Alright, we're pulling out early in the morning.

1344
01:54:47.030 --> 01:54:51.409
We're gonna chase these fellas clear down to Texas,
so don't spend too much of your own money. All right.

1345
01:54:52.369 --> 01:54:54.989
We're gonna divide up into four parties!

1346
01:54:55.249 --> 01:54:57.529
...and we'll hit all the
farms and the trails...

1347
01:54:57.789 --> 01:54:59.199
...to make a big circle...

1348
01:54:59.459 --> 01:55:01.369
...and we're bound to come across somebody...

1349
01:55:01.629 --> 01:55:03.699
...that's seen these... skunks.

1350
01:55:21.228 --> 01:55:23.388
Who's the fella owns this shithole?

1351
01:55:32.997 --> 01:55:36.367
You, fat man. Speak up.

1352
01:55:38.997 --> 01:55:41.456
I own this establishment.

1353
01:55:43.916 --> 01:55:47.586
I bought it from Greely for $1,000.

1354
01:55:49.006 --> 01:55:50.636
You better clear outta there.

1355
01:55:50.676 --> 01:55:52.676
Yes, sir.

1356
01:55:53.266 --> 01:55:56.146
Just hold it right there.
Hold it!

1357
01:56:05.775 --> 01:56:08.865
Well sir, you are
a cowardly son-of-a-bitch!

1358
01:56:10.075 --> 01:56:11.815
You just shot an unarmed man.

1359
01:56:12.285 --> 01:56:14.324
Well he should've armed himself...

1360
01:56:14.574 --> 01:56:17.324
...if he's gonna decorate his
saloon with my friend.

1361
01:56:18.044 --> 01:56:20.704
You'd be William Munny
out of Missouri...

1362
01:56:21.164 --> 01:56:23.044
...killer of women and children.

1363
01:56:23.714 --> 01:56:25.124
That's right.

1364
01:56:26.844 --> 01:56:28.794
I've killed women and children.

1365
01:56:30.344 --> 01:56:34.213
Killed just about everything that
walks or crawls at one time or another.

1366
01:56:35.473 --> 01:56:38.343
And I'm here to kill you, Little Bill.

1367
01:56:38.983 --> 01:56:41.303
For what you did to Ned.

1368
01:56:45.483 --> 01:56:47.392
You boys better move away.

1369
01:56:57.872 --> 01:57:02.032
All right, gentlemen.
He's got one barrel left.

1370
01:57:02.622 --> 01:57:05.281
When he fires that,
take out your pistols...

1371
01:57:05.541 --> 01:57:08.921
...and shoot him down
like the mangy scoundrel he is!

1372
01:57:22.490 --> 01:57:25.640
Misfire! Kill the son-of-a-bitch!

1373
01:58:01.978 --> 01:58:06.328
Any man don't want to get killed,
better clear on out the back.

1374
01:58:50.785 --> 01:58:52.445
I'm shot! I'm shot!

1375
01:58:52.945 --> 01:58:54.275
You ain't shot.

1376
01:58:56.535 --> 01:58:57.685
Oh, look, please...

1377
01:59:00.335 --> 01:59:03.284
I don't have a gun.
I am not armed.

1378
01:59:04.714 --> 01:59:06.204
Pick up that rifle.

1379
01:59:08.174 --> 01:59:09.454
Pick it up.

1380
01:59:11.844 --> 01:59:12.924
Shells too.

1381
01:59:26.153 --> 01:59:27.613
You killed Little Bill.

1382
01:59:29.153 --> 01:59:30.653
Sure you ain't armed?

1383
01:59:33.073 --> 01:59:34.982
No... look...I'm not.
I don't have a gun.

1384
01:59:35.242 --> 01:59:37.952
I've never had a gun.
I write. I'm a writer!

1385
01:59:39.412 --> 01:59:40.912
A writer?

1386
01:59:41.712 --> 01:59:43.832
- What, letters and such?
- No, books.

1387
01:59:44.542 --> 01:59:45.622
Books.

1388
01:59:46.252 --> 01:59:50.172
I don't believe it, you killed five men.
Single-handed.

1389
01:59:52.251 --> 01:59:53.471
Yeah.

1390
01:59:58.771 --> 02:00:00.971
That's a Spencer rifle, right?

1391
02:00:01.251 --> 02:00:02.271
That's right.

1392
02:00:09.400 --> 02:00:11.310
Who a... who'd you kill first?

1393
02:00:12.600 --> 02:00:13.210
Huh?

1394
02:00:15.240 --> 02:00:17.490
"When confronted by superior numbers...

1395
02:00:17.650 --> 02:00:20.770
...an experienced gunfighter will
always fire on the best shot first."

1396
02:00:21.150 --> 02:00:22.320
Is that so?

1397
02:00:22.450 --> 02:00:25.579
Yeah... Little Bill told me that.
You probably killed him first didn't ya?

1398
02:00:26.459 --> 02:00:28.499
I was lucky in the order.

1399
02:00:29.469 --> 02:00:32.299
But I've always been lucky
when it comes to killing folks.

1400
02:00:36.099 --> 02:00:38.089
Who was next?
...was Clyde, right?

1401
02:00:38.349 --> 02:00:41.058
You musta killed Clyde,
well coulda been Deputy Andy...

1402
02:00:41.308 --> 02:00:43.928
All I can tell you
is who's gonna be last.

1403
02:01:20.606 --> 02:01:22.556
I don't deserve this.

1404
02:01:24.606 --> 02:01:26.186
To die like this.

1405
02:01:29.026 --> 02:01:31.015
I was building a house.

1406
02:01:32.035 --> 02:01:34.695
Deserve's got nothing to do with it.

1407
02:01:37.415 --> 02:01:39.655
I'll see you in hell, William Munny.

1408
02:01:46.915 --> 02:01:48.254
Yeah.

1409
02:02:20.163 --> 02:02:22.282
All right, I'm coming out!

1410
02:02:22.712 --> 02:02:25.492
Any man I see out there,
I'm gonna kill him!

1411
02:02:26.082 --> 02:02:28.582
Any sumbitch takes a shot at me...

1412
02:02:29.302 --> 02:02:34.122
...I'm not only going to kill him, I'm
gonna kill his wife and all his friends...

1413
02:02:34.472 --> 02:02:36.712
...and burn his damn house down!

1414
02:02:44.061 --> 02:02:45.851
Nobody better shoot!

1415
02:03:01.410 --> 02:03:03.490
O.K. Charley Heckor, go ahead.
Shoot him!

1416
02:03:17.639 --> 02:03:18.969
I can't.

1417
02:03:19.429 --> 02:03:22.219
Hell, no!
I ain't no deputy!

1418
02:03:42.128 --> 02:03:44.747
You better bury Ned right!

1419
02:03:45.337 --> 02:03:49.037
You better not cut up
nor otherwise harm no whores!

1420
02:03:52.967 --> 02:03:56.387
Or I'll come back and kill every
one of you sons a bitches.
