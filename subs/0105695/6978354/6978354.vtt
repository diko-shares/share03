is a gentleman of French ancestry.

347
00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:04.300
Or so it seems.
I don't wish to give offense...

348
00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:08.470
...but the French are known
to be a race of assassins...

349
00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.720
...who can't shoot worth a damn.

350
00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:14.640
Any Frenchmen present
are excluded, of course.

351
00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:19.640
Says here a fellow by the name
of Guiteau. G-U-I-T...

352
00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:23.570
Sure as hell sounds
like a John Bull to me.

353
00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:29.610
Again, I don't wish to give offense
when I suggest this country select...

354
00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:34.160
...a king or even a queen,
rather than a president.

355
00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:39.120
One isn't that quick
to shoot a king or a queen.

356
00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:41.840
The majesty of royalty, you see.

357
00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:47.840
Maybe you don't wish
to give offense, sir...

358
00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:50.260
...but you are giving it pretty thick.

359
00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:53.430
This country don't need
no queens whatsoever.

360
00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:56.430

What's wrong with you, Thirsty?
This dude...

362
00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:02.560
Might be that this dude
is English Bob.

363
00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:06.610
Works for the railroad
shooting Chinamen.

364
00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:10.700
Might be he's waiting
for some cowboy to touch his pistol...

365
00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:12.570
...so he can shoot him.

366
00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:26.970
Is that a fact, mister?

367
00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:28.880

370
00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:38.470
Ten shots.

371
00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:41.480
At, let's say, $1 a pheasant.

372
00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:45.320
I'll shoot for the queen, and you...

373
00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:47.320

00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:51.130
ENGLISH BOB: That's the second one

386
00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:54.720

Pardon me, gentlemen.

391
00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:05.040
The law obliges you to surrender
sidearms to the proper authorities.

392
00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:07.330

If I'm going to get shot,
I'd rather it was hot than cold.

406
00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:12.270

Of course he's coming.

00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:32.840
I don't trust nobody loading my guns
before a shooting.

00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:34.250
What'd he say?

415
00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:37.670
Little Bill said
he was building his porch.

416
00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:41.260
- You seen that thing?
- It was all loaded.

417
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:45.430
Clyde, you got three pistols
and you only got one arm!

418
00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:49.570
I don't want to get killed
for lack of shooting back.

419
00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:54.440
He don't have a straight
angle on that whole porch!

420
00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:59.400
Or the whole house, for that matter!
He is the worst damn carpenter.

421
00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:01.740
He didn't say nothing?

422
00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:05.460
Asked what they looked like.

423
00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:08.910
Maybe he's tough, but he
sure ain't no carpenter.

424
00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:11.210
Maybe he ain't so tough.

425
00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:15.130

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.050

427
00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:22.560

against any like these ones.

Kansas and Texas, boys.

00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:31.060
He worked them tough towns.

431
00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:32.730
Just wondered.

00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:36.600
Anybody could be scared.

433
00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:43.610
He wasn't scared, boys.

434
00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:47.830
He just ain't no carpenter.

435
00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:54.880
There's a dignity in royalty...

436
00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:57.920
...which precludes
the likelihood of assassination.

437
00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:00.050
BARBER: Uh-huh.
- If you pointed a pistol...

438
00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:03.590
...at a monarch,
your hands would shake as if palsied.

439
00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:07.390
I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody.

440
00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:09.470
That's a wise policy.

441
00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:13.890
But if you did, I assure you,
the sight of royalty...

442
00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:17.440
...would cause you to dismiss thoughts
of bloodshed.

443
00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:18.850
BARBER: Right.
- You would stand...

444
00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:22.450

In awe.

He was called Two-Gun Corcoran.

662
00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:15.750
A lot of folks did call him Two-Gun,
but not because he had two pistols.

It was because his dick...

...was longer than the barrel
on his Walker Colt.

Only insulting he did was stick it
into a French lady Bob was sweet on.

a big dick, he would've been there...

Well, Mr. William Hendershot...

...what if I was to say you was
a no-good son of a bitch and a liar?

And if I was to say you shit in your

quick and kill me. Isn't that so?
