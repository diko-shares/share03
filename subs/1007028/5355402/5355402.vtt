1
00:00:35.654 --> 00:00:36.814
You little motherfucker!

2
00:00:52.004 --> 00:00:54.165
Get up, Zack.

3
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.160
Come on, I don't wanna be late
for work.

4
00:01:25.203 --> 00:01:26.568
<i>- Get out!</i>
- Jesus, fuck!

5
00:01:26.738 --> 00:01:28.860
Close the fucking door
if you're gonna take a shit.

6
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.568
- It was closed.
- It was closed over, it was not closed.

7
00:01:31.743 --> 00:01:33.438
- Close the door, Zack!
- Okay, okay.

8
00:01:33.612 --> 00:01:35.546
<i>- God.</i>
- Fine.

9
00:01:54.166 --> 00:01:56.430
- What's that thing?
- It's a hand warmer.

10
00:02:06.244 --> 00:02:07.677
We're going now.

11
00:02:17.923 --> 00:02:21.825
- You smell that? Is that the car? Fuck.
- Oh, goddamn it.

12
00:02:21.993 --> 00:02:24.018
- What? What?
- Oh, it's wedged in my taint.

13
00:02:24.196 --> 00:02:25.959
- What is?
- It got wedged in my taint.

14
00:02:26.131 --> 00:02:28.929
- What?
- It's stuck under my balls.

15
00:02:29.434 --> 00:02:31.959
- It's between my balls and my leg.
- What's happening?

16
00:02:32.137 --> 00:02:36.471
- Please, pull over. Pull the fuck over!
- Okay, all right! Jesus, okay.

17
00:02:36.641 --> 00:02:38.541
<i>- It's about to move up to my ass.
- What?</i>

18
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.302
<i>The movement makes it hotter.</i>

19
00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:43.414
It's tucked under them.
It's stuck under them.

20
00:02:54.226 --> 00:02:56.285
Oh, fuck.

21
00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.774
I think I burned my ball hair off.

22
00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.748
It's not funny.

23
00:03:31.363 --> 00:03:33.661
Can you help me pick out an outfit
for tonight?

24
00:03:33.832 --> 00:03:35.925
I'm working till 6.

25
00:03:38.403 --> 00:03:43.067
- Well, I can try stuff on at the store.
- The store?

26
00:03:43.241 --> 00:03:45.869
No, how about instead,
you get a friend?

27
00:03:46.044 --> 00:03:47.568
But you are my friend.

28
00:03:47.746 --> 00:03:51.045
I mean a girl friend, jeez.

29
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.221
Mr. Delaney,
can you work for me tomorrow?

30
00:04:35.393 --> 00:04:36.485
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.

31
00:04:36.661 --> 00:04:40.222
Then you must come in the next day,
I tell you.

32
00:04:40.398 --> 00:04:42.559
- It's Black Friday.
- Black Friday?

33
00:04:42.734 --> 00:04:45.703
It's the biggest mall-shopping day
of the year.

34
00:04:45.871 --> 00:04:50.706
And since the mall is just up the street,
I would like you to come out and work.

35
00:04:50.876 --> 00:04:53.276
- On Black Friday.
- Oh, yeah.

36
00:04:53.445 --> 00:04:55.845
All right, you want me to work
on Moolie Monday too?

37
00:04:56.014 --> 00:04:58.278
- I'm sorry?
- How about Nigga Tuesday?

38
00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.942
- Nigga Tuesday? This a new holiday?
- You come to a brother and tell him

39
00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.056
he gotta work on Black Friday. You
got any idea how racist that sounds?

40
00:05:06.224 --> 00:05:08.385
Telling me to work.
What, you think you own me?

41
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.654
- I never said this, I tell you.
- But you thought it, didn't you?

42
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:12.854
You thought,

43
00:05:13.031 --> 00:05:15.787
"I'm gonna lay down the law
for this nigga, I put food on his table,

44
00:05:15.867 --> 00:05:18.768
clothes on his nigga baby backs,
and he ain't gonna say shit."

45
00:05:18.937 --> 00:05:20.564
- This ain't <i>Amistad</i>.
- You shut up.

46
00:05:20.739 --> 00:05:24.038
You goddamn right this ain't <i>Amistad</i>.
I can't wait till the post office

47
00:05:24.209 --> 00:05:27.736
settles my disability suit because then
I'm gonna be out this motherfucker.

48
00:05:27.913 --> 00:05:30.177
I'm gonna be Oprah rich.
Y'all can kiss my ass.

49
00:05:30.348 --> 00:05:33.283
You know what? Fuck you.
Fuck you, and suck cock.

50
00:05:35.687 --> 00:05:37.587
- To hell with you.
<i>- To hell with you.</i>

51
00:05:37.756 --> 00:05:41.692
- Zachary will work. Zack, my boy.
- Yeah.

52
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.351
- The customer with the harelip...
- Oh, yeah.

53
00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:49.330
...speak me, say you were playing
baseball here the other night.

54
00:05:49.501 --> 00:05:52.959
Wiffle ball.
And, no, that wasn't me.

55
00:05:53.438 --> 00:05:55.963
Maybe the harelip
makes it sound like "baseball."

56
00:05:56.141 --> 00:05:57.836
<i>Yeah, maybe you
hear with an accent.</i>

57
00:05:58.009 --> 00:05:59.840
- Fuck you, okay?
- Okay.

58
00:06:00.011 --> 00:06:03.469
One day, I'm gonna put a camera
over there, and then I can tell...

59
00:06:03.648 --> 00:06:05.616
I'll know everything you do
when I'm gone.

60
00:06:05.784 --> 00:06:09.220
Everything. Scratch your balls,
take a shit, everything, I tell you, okay?

61
00:06:09.387 --> 00:06:11.947
Okay. Fucker.

62
00:06:12.357 --> 00:06:18.023
I hate both of you ebony and ivory
motherfuckers, I tell you.

63
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:24.462
- Why is he so fucking high-strung?
- "Fuck off, I tell you. Very good."

64
00:06:24.636 --> 00:06:27.876
Can you believe that Gandhi motherfucker,
telling me I gotta work on Black Friday?

65
00:06:28.006 --> 00:06:29.030
Ain't that some shit?

66
00:06:29.207 --> 00:06:31.072
- Yeah.
- Like I don't wanna do shopping.

67
00:06:31.242 --> 00:06:34.837
Biggest sales day of the year. I'm
getting a flat-screen TV, believe that.

68
00:06:35.013 --> 00:06:38.608
That's my fault, I should tell you. I
asked for Friday morning off, I'm sorry.

69
00:06:38.783 --> 00:06:41.752
- For what?
- I actually need a lot of recovery time.

70
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.388
Tonight is me and Miri's
ten-year high school reunion.

71
00:06:44.556 --> 00:06:47.286
I'm just gonna
get fucking alcohol poisoning.

72
00:06:47.459 --> 00:06:51.088
- Reunion? Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
- Isn't that fucked up that they do that?

73
00:06:51.262 --> 00:06:53.822
They say it's the best chance
to get everyone together.

74
00:06:53.999 --> 00:06:55.899
People come back in town
for the holidays.

75
00:06:56.067 --> 00:06:58.331
But they could have it
in the middle of the summer

76
00:06:58.503 --> 00:07:02.132
at a blowjob contest that I was judging,
and it would still be retarded.

77
00:07:02.807 --> 00:07:05.776
- So why you going, then?
- Miri's making me go.

78
00:07:05.944 --> 00:07:08.412
Why you always
bending over backwards for that girl,

79
00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.674
- knowing she ain't giving up no ass?
- We got a good thing going.

80
00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:15.217
She pays half the rent, does dishes,
she wakes me up in the morning.

81
00:07:15.387 --> 00:07:17.287
Why complicate that with sex?

82
00:07:17.455 --> 00:07:19.787
Besides, man, I've known her
since the first grade.

83
00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.222
You don't fuck someone
you met in the first grade.

84
00:07:22.394 --> 00:07:24.385
Excuse me,
I met my wife in kindergarten.

85
00:07:24.562 --> 00:07:25.893
We got married senior year,

86
00:07:26.064 --> 00:07:28.589
and she has been the queen
of my world ever since.

87
00:07:28.767 --> 00:07:32.259
- What if you could do it all over again?
- I'd jerk off and live by myself.

88
00:07:32.437 --> 00:07:34.200
That woman is the bane
of my existence.

89
00:07:34.372 --> 00:07:38.331
- See?
- Excuse me, can I get a coffee, black?

90
00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:41.035
Can't you see we talking, white?

91
00:07:43.615 --> 00:07:45.549
<i>If you're gonna continue
to emasculate me</i>

92
00:07:45.717 --> 00:07:48.117
with this Barbie dress-up shit,

93
00:07:48.286 --> 00:07:49.310
I'm using your laptop.

94
00:07:49.487 --> 00:07:51.887
Don't forget to smack it
when you turn it on,

95
00:07:52.057 --> 00:07:53.820
otherwise the screen
doesn't come on.

96
00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.523
Why don't you spring
and get a new one?

97
00:07:57.696 --> 00:08:00.529
Same reason I don't spring for clothes
for tonight, I'm broke.

98
00:08:00.699 --> 00:08:03.634
There's a chick who works
at Teen Juice at the mall, you know.

99
00:08:03.802 --> 00:08:05.292
I gave her a good deal on yarn,

100
00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:07.961
- so she's letting me borrow this stuff.
- Yo, bro.

101
00:08:09.941 --> 00:08:13.877
<i>- What?</i>
- You're buying a vibrator online.

102
00:08:14.045 --> 00:08:16.707
- What's wrong with the one you have?
<i>- It died last week.</i>

103
00:08:16.881 --> 00:08:19.475
Look at the size
of those fucking panties.

104
00:08:19.651 --> 00:08:21.312
Shoot that shit. Shoot it.

105
00:08:21.486 --> 00:08:23.818
<i>My God, who even knew
Amazon sold shit like this?</i>

106
00:08:23.988 --> 00:08:25.216
This is incredible.

107
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:28.450
- Those are fucking granny panties.
<i>- Okay,</i>

108
00:08:28.626 --> 00:08:32.187
A, I don't appreciate you violating the
sanctity of my Amazon Wish List page,

109
00:08:32.363 --> 00:08:34.422
and B, I'm not buying that thing
from Amazon,

110
00:08:34.599 --> 00:08:37.762
because it turns out
I don't have a credit card they take.

111
00:08:43.742 --> 00:08:47.473
- Oh, shit.
- I'm sorry, guys. Am I in the way?

112
00:08:47.879 --> 00:08:50.643
You're a fucking faggot, all right?
Let's go to Starbucks.

113
00:08:51.149 --> 00:08:55.142
- He's a shitty barista anyways.
- Cock.

114
00:08:57.522 --> 00:09:00.685
- And he throws like a bitch.
<i>- You know what else I throw?</i>

115
00:09:00.859 --> 00:09:03.589
My nut sack in your coffees,
so how did that taste, fucker?

116
00:09:03.762 --> 00:09:06.697
We saw your girlfriend
in her underwear, cunt nugget.

117
00:09:06.865 --> 00:09:10.130
Well, too bad she's not my girlfriend,
you little fuck... Oh, they're gone.

118
00:09:10.301 --> 00:09:11.962
<i>Are you still talking to me?</i>

119
00:09:12.137 --> 00:09:16.733
Just said, I'm gonna
look up more fuck toys on Amazon.

120
00:09:17.375 --> 00:09:19.366
Oh, holy shit.

121
00:09:19.544 --> 00:09:22.604
- They sell the Fleshlight here too.
- What's that?

122
00:09:22.781 --> 00:09:25.545
It's a fucking pocket pussy
that is shaped like a flashlight

123
00:09:25.717 --> 00:09:27.184
"for discretionary jacking off."

124
00:09:27.352 --> 00:09:29.786
That way if you get caught,
no one thinks it's weird.

125
00:09:29.954 --> 00:09:32.548
You're just a guy who likes to fuck
his flashlight.

126
00:09:32.724 --> 00:09:34.316
I am totally buying this shit.

127
00:09:34.492 --> 00:09:38.053
If you've got money to burn,
how about paying the electric bill?

128
00:09:38.229 --> 00:09:41.027
- That's due already?
- November's is probably due now,

129
00:09:41.199 --> 00:09:45.033
but I was talking about September's.
Tell me this doesn't rock.

130
00:09:47.138 --> 00:09:49.003
You kind of look
like Ronald McDonald.

131
00:09:49.174 --> 00:09:50.903
That makes me want
some McNuggets.

132
00:09:51.075 --> 00:09:54.442
Why would you wanna buy a
pocket pussy anyway? That is so sad.

133
00:09:54.612 --> 00:09:56.910
What? Excuse me,
I forgot about the nobility

134
00:09:57.081 --> 00:09:59.743
that accompanies coming
with a fucking vibrator.

135
00:09:59.918 --> 00:10:03.581
Think a kid in Darfur gets saved every
time a vibrator makes you come? No.

136
00:10:03.755 --> 00:10:05.655
- "Real feel action"? Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

137
00:10:05.824 --> 00:10:07.985
If you start fucking machines,
I'm moving out.

138
00:10:08.159 --> 00:10:10.354
What do you think a vibrator is?
It's a machine.

139
00:10:10.528 --> 00:10:12.996
How come you get
to fuck something with a motor in it?

140
00:10:13.164 --> 00:10:16.065
I've never met a man who can
make me come like a vibrator does.

141
00:10:16.234 --> 00:10:19.601
That's bullshit. You get to be Buck
Rogers having sex in the 25th century

142
00:10:19.771 --> 00:10:21.671
with fucking Twiki and Dr. Theopolis.

143
00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.172
I'm stuck to a bottle of Jergens
in the bathroom.

144
00:10:24.342 --> 00:10:29.370
Holy bejesus. You do not use
my Jergens to jack it in our bathroom.

145
00:10:29.547 --> 00:10:32.448
<i>No, you know what I do actually,
is I light a bunch of candles</i>

146
00:10:32.617 --> 00:10:36.075
and I sprawl out on my sheets
and I listen to Sting.

147
00:10:36.254 --> 00:10:39.655
No, I'm a guy. Give me
two Popsicle sticks and a rubber band,

148
00:10:39.824 --> 00:10:42.793
I'll find a way to fuck it,
like a filthy MacGyver.

149
00:10:42.961 --> 00:10:47.227
Oh, my God, I'm so glad I'm not a guy.
How about this?

150
00:10:47.398 --> 00:10:50.299
I don't get why you're putting
so much effort into this thing.

151
00:10:50.468 --> 00:10:55.235
I thought we were just gonna go to
sit around and make fun of everybody.

152
00:10:55.406 --> 00:10:59.604
I can't wear anything that I already own
and expect to bring home Bobby Long.

153
00:10:59.777 --> 00:11:05.215
Bobby fucking Long? No way.
Didn't that guy call you "Stinky Linky"?

154
00:11:05.383 --> 00:11:06.577
Yeah, that was then, okay?

155
00:11:06.751 --> 00:11:09.413
Maybe now he can save me a fortune
in Amazon bills.

156
00:11:09.587 --> 00:11:12.454
Maybe you can fuck our landlord

157
00:11:12.624 --> 00:11:14.888
so we can at least keep a roof
over our heads.

158
00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.996
You don't have the rent?
Zack, it's your month.

159
00:11:19.163 --> 00:11:21.825
Hey, I bought skates
with last week's paycheck

160
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.491
and I need those to skate with.-

161
00:11:24.669 --> 00:11:28.765
And this week's will barely cover
the past two water bills, so...

162
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.532
Is this sexy?

163
00:11:30.708 --> 00:11:34.508
Yeah, in like a <i>To Catch a Predator</i>
kind of way, it is pretty fucking sexy.

164
00:11:35.647 --> 00:11:37.080
Then we're done.

165
00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:41.284
What the fuck? Zack.

166
00:11:41.753 --> 00:11:44.586
- You want me to come in?
- What happened to the water?

167
00:11:48.693 --> 00:11:51.662
- They shut it off.
- Oh, shit. Just...

168
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:55.731
Help me get this shit out of my hair.
Just use the water out of the toilet.

169
00:11:58.336 --> 00:12:00.327
- There's poo in there.
- Not that part.

170
00:12:00.505 --> 00:12:03.065
- The back part of the toilet thing.
- Oh, that makes sense.

171
00:12:03.241 --> 00:12:06.438
<i>Take the cup there
and then scoop it in, there you go.</i>

172
00:12:06.611 --> 00:12:10.479
Here, I'll lean back and you can just,
you know, pour it down like... Like that.

173
00:12:10.648 --> 00:12:12.240
<i>You're harshing my buzz,
you know.</i>

174
00:12:12.417 --> 00:12:14.317
This is so lame.
Don't look. Don't look.

175
00:12:14.485 --> 00:12:16.043
Don't look.

176
00:12:29.334 --> 00:12:31.666
All right, one hour tops,
then we're gone.

177
00:12:31.836 --> 00:12:32.860
Or I had an idea.

178
00:12:33.037 --> 00:12:35.505
We could just not go at all,
which would rock.

179
00:12:36.407 --> 00:12:39.376
Even though we're broke
and we've never amounted to anything,

180
00:12:39.544 --> 00:12:41.535
we're still better than these people,
right?

181
00:12:41.713 --> 00:12:46.275
No. Not at all. We're probably
not even as good as most of them,

182
00:12:46.451 --> 00:12:48.817
unless one of them is a crackhead
or something.

183
00:12:48.987 --> 00:12:51.785
Just tell me I'm prettier
than when we graduated.

184
00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:54.285
You look about the same.

185
00:12:54.459 --> 00:12:57.587
Definitely not prettier,
but around the same.

186
00:12:58.029 --> 00:12:59.724
I'm thinner, though, right?
A little?

187
00:13:00.832 --> 00:13:01.924
Not really.

188
00:13:03.167 --> 00:13:05.727
Well, good pep talk. Fuck.

189
00:13:16.447 --> 00:13:19.075
- Ta-da.
- Ta-da.

190
00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:25.387
- You don't recognize us, do you?
- Um, no, sorry.

191
00:13:25.556 --> 00:13:27.353
Zack Brown, Miri Linky.

192
00:13:27.792 --> 00:13:29.692
Were you the one they called
Stinky Linky?

193
00:13:29.861 --> 00:13:32.591
Oh, no, no one ever called me that.

194
00:13:34.032 --> 00:13:36.557
- Great. What does yours say?
- What the fuck? Come on.

195
00:13:36.734 --> 00:13:40.261
- I'm sure I had a nickname. Nothing?
- All right, you have a great time,

196
00:13:40.438 --> 00:13:44.738
and before you go, don't forget
your copy of The Roving Roe-Ver.

197
00:13:44.909 --> 00:13:46.433
What the fuck's this shit?

198
00:13:46.611 --> 00:13:49.637
That is not shit, that would be
our bi-monthly newsletter.

199
00:13:49.814 --> 00:13:51.213
- Awesome.
<i>- It updates you</i>

200
00:13:51.382 --> 00:13:54.044
- on what everyone's doing.
- Finally.

201
00:13:54.218 --> 00:13:58.086
I love your enthusiasm. Here you go.
Write your e-mail address on that

202
00:13:58.256 --> 00:14:02.056
and I'll be sure to add you
to our 800-member-strong mailing list.

203
00:14:02.226 --> 00:14:04.217
We had 800 people
in our graduating class?

204
00:14:04.395 --> 00:14:09.059
Yes, and only 250 R.S.V.P.'d.
Doesn't that suck, Mary?

205
00:14:09.567 --> 00:14:11.558
- Miri.
- You married, Bets?

206
00:14:11.736 --> 00:14:14.671
- I am. Two kids.
- Wow, that's beautiful.

207
00:14:14.839 --> 00:14:16.932
- Awesome.
- You wanna fuck me later?

208
00:14:17.108 --> 00:14:20.202
- No, I'm married.
- Okay, cool. If you change your mind,

209
00:14:20.378 --> 00:14:22.573
- I'll be in there getting shitfaced.
- He will.

210
00:14:22.747 --> 00:14:24.942
- Just so you know, I eat the pussy.
- He does.

211
00:14:25.116 --> 00:14:27.414
Tempting. Again, no.

212
00:14:27.585 --> 00:14:30.816
- Shall we?
- Sir. Bye, Bets.

213
00:14:31.489 --> 00:14:33.480
Think about it.

214
00:15:19.837 --> 00:15:21.327
<i>Enjoy.</i>

215
00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:25.304
Can I get two beers, please?
You want a beer?

216
00:15:25.476 --> 00:15:27.740
- Yeah.
- Three beers.

217
00:15:28.212 --> 00:15:30.305
- Thank you.
<i>- Here you go.</i>

218
00:15:30.481 --> 00:15:36.511
Is that Zack? Or am I Zack?
Ho, ho.

219
00:15:36.787 --> 00:15:38.345
<i>Oh, wow.</i>

220
00:15:38.523 --> 00:15:41.014
- Never gets old, huh?
- The other Zack.

221
00:15:41.192 --> 00:15:44.719
Oh, in my world,
nobody calls me "the other Zack,"

222
00:15:44.896 --> 00:15:48.354
now that this guy's not around
anymore, huh?

223
00:15:48.533 --> 00:15:53.527
- Get the fuck off of me.
- There can be only one.

224
00:15:54.172 --> 00:15:57.369
- What?
- Highlander, man? The Kurgan.

225
00:15:57.542 --> 00:16:01.444
Remember? I'd yell it at you whenever
we passed each other in the hallway?

226
00:16:01.612 --> 00:16:04.206
Like it was yesterday, man.
Awesome. Awesome.

227
00:16:04.382 --> 00:16:08.045
Awesome. God, you guys have
so much to catch up on.

228
00:16:08.219 --> 00:16:10.084
- No.
- I'm gonna let you get to it.

229
00:16:10.254 --> 00:16:11.787
- Bitch.
- Bitch.

230
00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:19.691
Have you seen that big blowup picture
they have of me?

231
00:16:19.864 --> 00:16:20.888
Yeah, it's...

232
00:16:21.799 --> 00:16:25.098
My hair is terrible. I can't believe
I even wore my hair like that.

233
00:16:25.269 --> 00:16:28.170
That's before I knew
about styling products, you know.

234
00:16:28.339 --> 00:16:32.867
It makes a big difference in life.
But you live and learn, though, right?

235
00:16:33.044 --> 00:16:37.606
I mean, ten years ago, Pittsburgh,
who knew anything about fashion?

236
00:16:38.449 --> 00:16:43.386
Back in the day, our hairstyle, ..

237
00:16:44.855 --> 00:16:45.947
Hey, stranger.

238
00:16:47.491 --> 00:16:52.554
- Stinky Linky.
- Yeah. Although it's just Miri now.

239
00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:54.925
- Give me a hug.
- Oh, okay.

240
00:16:55.099 --> 00:16:57.863
- Hi.
- Hi.

241
00:16:58.035 --> 00:16:59.593
Wow.

242
00:17:00.171 --> 00:17:02.139
- How have you been?
- Great, great.

243
00:17:02.306 --> 00:17:03.796
- Yeah?
- You look fantastic.

244
00:17:03.975 --> 00:17:08.309
Wow, that is not something that you
would have said to me ten years ago.

245
00:17:08.479 --> 00:17:12.245
- Well, I've grown up.
- Yes. Yes, you have.

246
00:17:12.416 --> 00:17:15.044
You just look...

247
00:17:18.489 --> 00:17:23.324
- Well, listen to you. Thank you.
- No, don't thank me, just fuck me.

248
00:17:37.241 --> 00:17:39.209
Roxanne. Hey.

249
00:17:39.377 --> 00:17:42.437
Someone I like, what are the odds,
huh?

250
00:17:44.849 --> 00:17:47.113
Zack Brown, we had four years
of Spanish together.

251
00:17:47.285 --> 00:17:48.616
Why does no one recognize me?

252
00:17:48.786 --> 00:17:51.220
- Am I thinner? Is that it?
- Look at him.

253
00:17:52.423 --> 00:17:54.823
- Who?
- My stupid husband.

254
00:17:54.992 --> 00:17:59.452
No fucking shit. John Butterfield?
You actually married John Butterfield?

255
00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:01.860
- That's amazing.
- Don't ever get married.

256
00:18:02.033 --> 00:18:05.764
It sucks. You stop appreciating each
other and run out of shit to talk about

257
00:18:05.936 --> 00:18:10.373
after the first year.
But look at him now, chatty as fuck.

258
00:18:10.541 --> 00:18:13.874
Flirting up a storm with that
cheerleader nimrod Monica Von.

259
00:18:14.745 --> 00:18:18.909
You want me to maybe flirt with you
so he can see it, even it up a bit?

260
00:18:19.083 --> 00:18:20.141
I don't wanna get even.

261
00:18:21.485 --> 00:18:24.613
If I was gonna do anything,
I'd wanna one-up the asshole.

262
00:18:26.357 --> 00:18:28.917
You can give me a handjob
in the girls' locker room.

263
00:18:34.031 --> 00:18:35.965
- Fine, but make it fast.
- Fuck, yeah.

264
00:18:36.133 --> 00:18:38.658
Are you staying in town
for a while or...?

265
00:18:38.836 --> 00:18:41.532
Just tonight. I fly back
to L.A. tomorrow.

266
00:18:41.872 --> 00:18:47.435
L.A., wow, Los Angeles. Gosh,
Bobby Long, coming up in the world.

267
00:18:47.912 --> 00:18:53.851
- With Mrs. Long, I bet, huh?
- No, no, no. No Mrs. Long for me.

268
00:18:54.318 --> 00:18:57.412
- Then can I be honest with you?
- Sure.

269
00:19:01.359 --> 00:19:02.883
I think I need a drink.

270
00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:05.722
Do you need a drink?
Because I need a drink to say this.

271
00:19:05.896 --> 00:19:09.263
- I've got a beer already, so...
- Oh, great, thank you.

272
00:19:09.734 --> 00:19:12.032
I think there's a
cigarette butt in there.

273
00:19:12.203 --> 00:19:13.227
Yup.

274
00:19:17.174 --> 00:19:19.233
Sorry about the elbow.

275
00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:25.874
There can be only one.

276
00:19:27.918 --> 00:19:30.045
Can I get a beer, please?

277
00:19:31.889 --> 00:19:34.687
Thank you very much.

278
00:19:35.326 --> 00:19:38.056
Oh, Jesus Christ.

279
00:19:38.229 --> 00:19:41.460
My friend's making an ass of herself
hitting on her high school crush.

280
00:19:41.632 --> 00:19:43.532
Oh, God, that's so sad.

281
00:19:43.701 --> 00:19:46.499
It's so Miri, is what it is.
I'm Zack, by the way.

282
00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:48.399
Brandon.

283
00:19:50.007 --> 00:19:52.475
Don't worry, we weren't
in the same class or anything.

284
00:19:52.643 --> 00:19:56.909
- Okay. Lucky you.
- Are you a Monroe-ver?

285
00:19:57.081 --> 00:20:00.312
Well, I went here,
let's just leave it at that, I guess.

286
00:20:00.484 --> 00:20:03.544
Do you have one of the large
blown-up pictures of your younger self

287
00:20:03.721 --> 00:20:06.588
- hanging around here?
- I do, kind of. Right there.

288
00:20:09.293 --> 00:20:11.523
<i>- Gorgeous.</i>
- Good times.

289
00:20:11.695 --> 00:20:14.027
What do you do?
What brings you here?

290
00:20:14.198 --> 00:20:16.257
I came with somebody
who went to school here.

291
00:20:16.434 --> 00:20:17.594
- Really?
- Bobby Long.

292
00:20:17.768 --> 00:20:20.999
No shit. That's who my friend's hitting
on right now. See right there?

293
00:20:21.172 --> 00:20:23.902
- Really.
- One dressed like Hannah Montana?

294
00:20:24.542 --> 00:20:27.340
In L.A., we call that look
"Nickelodeon chic."

295
00:20:27.511 --> 00:20:29.877
- Wait, L.A.? Los Angeles?
- California.

296
00:20:30.047 --> 00:20:32.174
That's awesome, man.
What do you do out there?

297
00:20:32.349 --> 00:20:36.308
- I'm an actor.
- Wow, that's really impressive.

298
00:20:36.487 --> 00:20:38.853
- Thank you, thank you.
- In fucking movies?

299
00:20:39.023 --> 00:20:41.651
"Fucking movies." Pretty much.

300
00:20:41.826 --> 00:20:44.727
Look at you. What...?
Anything I've seen? What movies?

301
00:20:44.895 --> 00:20:46.886
Oh, all sorts of movies
with all-male casts.

302
00:20:47.064 --> 00:20:50.465
All-male casts.
Like Glengarry Glen Ross? Like that?

303
00:20:50.801 --> 00:20:54.430
Like Glen and Gary
Suck Ross' Meaty Cock

304
00:20:54.605 --> 00:20:58.041
and Drop Their Hairy Nuts
in His Eager Mouth.

305
00:21:00.044 --> 00:21:03.673
- Is that like a sequel?
- Sort of.

306
00:21:03.848 --> 00:21:07.409
- It's a re-imagining.
- Oh, like <i>The Wiz</i>.

307
00:21:07.585 --> 00:21:11.749
More erotic and with less women.

308
00:21:11.922 --> 00:21:14.413
No women, to be exact.

309
00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:20.759
I apologize in advance
if I am out of line here,

310
00:21:20.931 --> 00:21:22.728
but are you in gay porn?

311
00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:25.425
- Guilty as charged.
- Are you fucking with me?

312
00:21:25.603 --> 00:21:28.766
- I thought you recognized me, that's...
- Oh, okay, I get it.

313
00:21:28.939 --> 00:21:31.271
You're not in my demographic,
so I'm not insulted.

314
00:21:31.442 --> 00:21:34.741
- Not really. Who's your demographic?
- Do you love pussy?

315
00:21:34.912 --> 00:21:36.675
- I do.
- Then not you.

316
00:21:36.847 --> 00:21:38.007
Oh, okay.

317
00:21:38.182 --> 00:21:40.377
I came here tonight

318
00:21:40.551 --> 00:21:43.577
hoping to seduce you
and bring you back to my apartment

319
00:21:43.754 --> 00:21:46.780
and sleep with you to,
get back at you,

320
00:21:46.957 --> 00:21:51.223
you know, for calling me Stinky Linky
all those years ago.

321
00:21:51.395 --> 00:21:52.419
Wow.

322
00:21:52.596 --> 00:21:54.723
That is a weird revenge plot.

323
00:21:54.899 --> 00:21:57.697
- You must be a terrible lay for that.
- What? No, I'm great.

324
00:21:57.868 --> 00:22:00.462
I mean, I've had enough practice
and everything. That...

325
00:22:00.638 --> 00:22:04.130
Wow, that sounded not good.

326
00:22:04.308 --> 00:22:09.302
I fuck a lot. That's what I meant to say.
That doesn't sound good either. Wow.

327
00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:12.210
You're a lot funnier than I remember.

328
00:22:12.883 --> 00:22:17.820
Thank you. Gosh,
you turned out to be such a nice guy.

329
00:22:19.456 --> 00:22:24.052
It just... You know, it makes it even
easier to just... To just say this.

330
00:22:24.228 --> 00:22:28.824
Would you like to come back to my
place and maybe open a bottle of wine

331
00:22:28.999 --> 00:22:32.332
and have ourselves
a real high school reunion?

332
00:22:33.037 --> 00:22:34.595
- I...
- Hello, Miriam.

333
00:22:34.772 --> 00:22:35.864
Beat it, we're talking.

334
00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:39.134
- I wanted to introduce you to Brandon.
- Salutations.

335
00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:41.471
- Bobby's boyfriend.
- Bobby who?

336
00:22:41.645 --> 00:22:44.443
- Bobby me.
- Bobby Long.

337
00:22:45.416 --> 00:22:51.321
Brandon is the star of such adult fare
as... What was that one called again?

338
00:22:52.022 --> 00:22:54.286
<i>You Better Shut Your Mouth
or I'm Gonna Fuck It.</i>

339
00:22:54.458 --> 00:22:57.484
That's right.
I'm surprised I forgot that.

340
00:22:57.761 --> 00:22:59.194
Are you fucking with me?

341
00:22:59.363 --> 00:23:01.695
No, they're fucking with each other.

342
00:23:02.099 --> 00:23:03.191
Oh, my God.

343
00:23:04.868 --> 00:23:06.859
- No.
- What?

344
00:23:08.138 --> 00:23:09.537
<i>Granny Panties</i>?

345
00:23:09.707 --> 00:23:11.334
- Excuse me?
- How can you tell?

346
00:23:11.775 --> 00:23:12.901
This is so crazy.

347
00:23:13.077 --> 00:23:16.137
I was literally just watching you, like,
right before we got here.

348
00:23:16.313 --> 00:23:19.214
This is so crazy. This is you, right?

349
00:23:19.383 --> 00:23:20.714
<i>My name's Granny Panties,</i>

350
00:23:20.884 --> 00:23:23.148
<i>and nobody wants to fuck me.</i>

351
00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:25.845
<i>Nothing's whiter
than my big gay ass...</i>

352
00:23:26.023 --> 00:23:27.047
Where'd you get that?

353
00:23:27.224 --> 00:23:29.692
Oh, I entered "gay" and "ass,"
and it was the top hit.

354
00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:34.729
It's had 200,000 views in three hours.
Honey, you are, like...

355
00:23:34.898 --> 00:23:37.526
I'm jealous right now
because you're, like, super famous.

356
00:23:37.701 --> 00:23:41.228
Baby, please take our picture.
I get a picture with Granny Panties.

357
00:23:41.405 --> 00:23:43.566
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- This is awesome.

358
00:23:43.741 --> 00:23:46.437
- All right, smile. Okay, got it.
- Did you get it?

359
00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:48.840
- Oh, thank you very much.
- E-mail me that.

360
00:23:49.013 --> 00:23:51.538
Oh, because he's the worst
photographer. Okay, good.

361
00:23:51.715 --> 00:23:53.910
- You're gay?
- Yeah.

362
00:23:54.718 --> 00:23:58.017
And I'm on the Internet
wearing a diaper?

363
00:23:58.188 --> 00:24:00.918
Who knew you'd come to Pittsburgh
and meet a celebrity?

364
00:24:01.892 --> 00:24:03.860
I'm gonna binge-drink now
until I pass out.

365
00:24:04.028 --> 00:24:08.158
Okay. She'll be fine. So you guys
suck each other's cocks, huh?

366
00:24:08.332 --> 00:24:09.731
Oh, like crazy.

367
00:24:11.602 --> 00:24:13.797
Okay, that's enough, I think.

368
00:24:13.971 --> 00:24:16.055
I'm embarrassing him.
I love when he's embarrassed.

369
00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:18.574
He's not living out loud,
so he gets all like.

370
00:24:18.742 --> 00:24:21.836
- You are totally in love, aren't you?
- Zachary, we are.

371
00:24:22.012 --> 00:24:23.172
Wow, I...

372
00:24:23.347 --> 00:24:25.097
Oh, God, I just wanna eat him up,
yum, yum.

373
00:24:25.249 --> 00:24:27.012
Save some for me, yum, yum, yum.

374
00:24:27.184 --> 00:24:29.880
- I can't keep my hands off him.
- You've had one too many.

375
00:24:30.054 --> 00:24:33.717
Although he does most of the eating in
the sack. In the sack and of the sack.

376
00:24:34.158 --> 00:24:36.752
All right, that's enough.
Look, you've drunk too much.

377
00:24:36.927 --> 00:24:40.021
You do this every time. You get too
Mary for everybody in the room

378
00:24:40.197 --> 00:24:42.757
- and you can't contain yourself.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

379
00:24:42.933 --> 00:24:47.097
And by containing myself, do you
mean containing myself in a closet?

380
00:24:47.271 --> 00:24:49.967
In a closet of denial? Is that...?
No, no, no.

381
00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:51.869
Holy shit, this just got real.

382
00:24:52.042 --> 00:24:54.135
This is exactly why
you haven't met my mother.

383
00:24:54.311 --> 00:24:56.779
You don't know how to ease people
into this situation.

384
00:24:56.947 --> 00:25:00.906
- You just force your way in every time.
- I thought, maybe for one second

385
00:25:01.085 --> 00:25:04.350
in this godforsaken town,
I could be myself. I'm so sorry.

386
00:25:04.521 --> 00:25:06.614
No, you're right, I should just butch up

387
00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:12.057
and pretend that I don't love it when
you shove your dick in my mouth.

388
00:25:12.229 --> 00:25:15.323
- This is the best night of my life.
<i>- Am I making a spectacle?</i>

389
00:25:15.499 --> 00:25:17.933
- I could make a much bigger scene.
- You really are.

390
00:25:18.102 --> 00:25:21.435
I'm sorry. Pittsburgh.
Listen up, Monroe-vers.

391
00:25:21.605 --> 00:25:26.065
My name is Brandon St. Randy,
and I love Bobby Long.

392
00:25:26.243 --> 00:25:27.767
- Fucking A.
<i>- Is that enough?</i>

393
00:25:27.945 --> 00:25:30.846
Is that enough of a scene?
I could start doing worse than that.

394
00:25:31.014 --> 00:25:33.414
The reason you haven't taken me
to your mother's...

395
00:25:33.584 --> 00:25:37.145
Your mother with her makeup and all
her drinking, she's in the closet too.

396
00:25:37.321 --> 00:25:40.916
- They fight just like real people.
- I thought I'd be a conduit for you...

397
00:25:41.091 --> 00:25:42.183
Thank you.

398
00:25:42.359 --> 00:25:45.157
- Are you being sarcastic?
- No, I'm not.

399
00:25:45.829 --> 00:25:48.457
- Thank you.
- I love you.

400
00:25:49.333 --> 00:25:51.801
- I'll e-mail you.
- Zack, it was so nice to meet you.

401
00:25:51.969 --> 00:25:55.234
And I will be patient with you.
I will be there on your journey.

402
00:25:55.405 --> 00:25:59.136
I will be your Sherpa
up the mountain of gayness.

403
00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:31.107
Well, might as well see how many hits
Granny Panties is up to, huh?

404
00:26:34.945 --> 00:26:36.742
Did I do that?

405
00:26:44.321 --> 00:26:46.255
Thanks, George.

406
00:26:47.758 --> 00:26:51.125
What kind of evil fucks
turn off your power the day...?

407
00:26:51.295 --> 00:26:56.358
No, the night before Thanksgiving?
Who does that?

408
00:26:56.533 --> 00:26:58.194
Can you get an advance on your card?

409
00:26:58.368 --> 00:27:03.237
Fleshlight maxed-out my $200 limit.
Not a wise purchase, I'll give you that.

410
00:27:03.407 --> 00:27:07.400
This is bad. If we don't come up
with rent, we're gonna get locked out.

411
00:27:07.578 --> 00:27:10.342
Who the fuck wants to live there?
There's no water or power.

412
00:27:10.514 --> 00:27:13.950
Which means by the time
we get home, there's no heat either.

413
00:27:14.952 --> 00:27:18.683
Well, I think it's time we put what
we always talked about into effect.

414
00:27:19.356 --> 00:27:22.052
- You're gonna have to start hooking.
- You know, you jest,

415
00:27:22.226 --> 00:27:25.127
but these are the exact circumstances
people find themselves in

416
00:27:25.295 --> 00:27:27.695
right before
they start having sex for money.

417
00:27:27.865 --> 00:27:30.561
- Yeah.
- Or making porn.

418
00:27:44.548 --> 00:27:47.381
<i>- Oh, my God, yeah.</i>
- What? You got an idea?

419
00:27:47.551 --> 00:27:48.984
We could make a porno.

420
00:27:49.386 --> 00:27:51.320
- Not the idea I was looking for.
- What?

421
00:27:51.488 --> 00:27:55.083
No, that is a fucking awesome idea.
Are you shitting me? That's a rad idea.

422
00:27:55.259 --> 00:27:59.195
That guy, Brandon St. Randy, who's
Bobby Long's awesome nice boyfriend,

423
00:27:59.363 --> 00:28:01.126
he said he makes
a hundred grand a year

424
00:28:01.298 --> 00:28:04.927
because he shoots and distributes
his own porno flicks.

425
00:28:05.102 --> 00:28:07.400
If it's so easy,
how come everybody doesn't do it?

426
00:28:07.571 --> 00:28:10.870
Because other people have options
and dignity, which we do not have,

427
00:28:11.041 --> 00:28:14.101
which puts us in an amazingly
advantageous position.

428
00:28:14.278 --> 00:28:15.768
Fuck you, I have dignity.

429
00:28:15.946 --> 00:28:18.141
Where? Is it hidden
in your gigantic underpants

430
00:28:18.315 --> 00:28:21.910
that are plastered all over the Internet?
Is that where you hide your dignity?

431
00:28:22.085 --> 00:28:25.987
Every woman has a pair of those
period panties. That's, like, a fact.

432
00:28:26.156 --> 00:28:27.180
Okay. Families.

433
00:28:27.357 --> 00:28:30.121
I bet people don't make porno,
because they have families.

434
00:28:30.294 --> 00:28:35.197
But luckily, your parents are dead.
Sorry. My grandparents are dead.

435
00:28:35.365 --> 00:28:37.060
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

436
00:28:37.234 --> 00:28:40.601
So who are we gonna disappoint?
Porn has gone mainstream now.

437
00:28:40.771 --> 00:28:45.299
It's like Coca-Cola or Pepsi with dicks
in it. Look at Paris Hilton.

438
00:28:45.475 --> 00:28:47.670
She throat-fucks a guy in night vision,

439
00:28:47.844 --> 00:28:50.108
now she's selling fragrances
to tweens.

440
00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.475
And I'm pretty sure
she's legally retarded.

441
00:28:52.649 --> 00:28:53.673
That's for tweens?

442
00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:56.614
Have you seen that Joe Francis guy
who made Girls Gone Wild?

443
00:28:56.787 --> 00:28:59.722
That guy is the biggest fucking idiot
piece of shit in the world

444
00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:02.051
and he has a jet and a fucking island.

445
00:29:02.225 --> 00:29:07.128
Look, there's got to be a less extreme
solution to our financial woes here.

446
00:29:07.297 --> 00:29:09.857
- Give me a better option.
- Get a paper route.

447
00:29:10.033 --> 00:29:11.830
- I don't have a bike.
- Be a waiter.

448
00:29:12.002 --> 00:29:15.665
No one wants me around their food.
Would you eat food that I gave you?

449
00:29:15.839 --> 00:29:18.239
I would not eat food that you gave me,
that's true.

450
00:29:18.408 --> 00:29:20.706
<i>I mean, nobody
wants to see us fuck, Zack.</i>

451
00:29:20.877 --> 00:29:24.506
<i>Everybody wants to see anybody fuck.
I hate Rosie O'Donnell,</i>

452
00:29:24.681 --> 00:29:28.242
but if someone said, "I got a tape of
Rosie O'Donnell getting fucked stupid,"

453
00:29:28.418 --> 00:29:31.046
I'd be like, "Why aren't we
watching that right now?"

454
00:29:31.221 --> 00:29:32.518
Because she's famous. Hello.

455
00:29:32.689 --> 00:29:34.782
So are you.
You're fucking Granny Panties.

456
00:29:34.958 --> 00:29:38.394
My underwear and your ass
are famous, we're not.

457
00:29:38.562 --> 00:29:41.087
So who the F
would wanna watch us fuck?

458
00:29:41.264 --> 00:29:43.994
- At least 800 people.
- The jerks we went to school with?

459
00:29:44.167 --> 00:29:45.862
- Are you serious?
- Of course.

460
00:29:46.036 --> 00:29:48.004
If you heard
that someone we graduated with

461
00:29:48.171 --> 00:29:50.571
was in a fucking porno movie,
you'd watch it, right?

462
00:29:50.741 --> 00:29:53.266
I'd watch that guy Brandon
suck a cock, I just met him.

463
00:29:53.443 --> 00:29:56.003
With this mailing list,
we have almost a thousand people

464
00:29:56.179 --> 00:29:58.977
that would definitely buy a porno
we were in just to be like,

465
00:29:59.149 --> 00:30:02.414
"Hey, I sat next to that guy in Civics.
Look at his fucking dick."

466
00:30:02.586 --> 00:30:07.114
We sell a thousand copies at 20 bucks
a pop, bam, we have paid off our bills.

467
00:30:08.158 --> 00:30:12.117
<i>- So, what do you think?</i>
- I don't think I wanna fuck a stranger.

468
00:30:12.295 --> 00:30:14.786
Oh, wow,
like you've never done that before.

469
00:30:14.965 --> 00:30:18.401
How many guys have you met in a bar,
taken home,

470
00:30:18.568 --> 00:30:22.231
banged with your mouth
and then never talked to again?

471
00:30:22.406 --> 00:30:23.896
That's what we call a stranger.

472
00:30:24.074 --> 00:30:28.135
Dude, I don't one-night mouth-fuck
anybody that I pick up in bars.

473
00:30:28.311 --> 00:30:32.680
You don't wanna fuck a stranger in the
porno movie for some weird reason.

474
00:30:33.717 --> 00:30:34.809
I guess...

475
00:30:37.921 --> 00:30:38.979
We could fuck.

476
00:30:40.023 --> 00:30:41.991
Fuck you.

477
00:30:42.159 --> 00:30:45.322
I mean, you're a nice-enough-looking
guy and everything...

478
00:30:45.495 --> 00:30:48.362
Holy fuck, thank you.
You're an all-right-enough-looking girl.

479
00:30:48.532 --> 00:30:50.659
- How does that feel?
- Dude, I'm just saying

480
00:30:50.834 --> 00:30:53.530
it'd be weird and wrong, you know,
like fucking my brother.

481
00:30:53.703 --> 00:30:56.433
Okay, seriously,
we're just talking about sex, okay?

482
00:30:56.606 --> 00:31:00.975
It's for a purpose. It's for getting rich.
Only my dick and your pussy

483
00:31:01.144 --> 00:31:05.012
would be doing something weird.
Our bodies and brains would be acting.

484
00:31:05.549 --> 00:31:08.484
- Wow.
- Just explain to your private beforehand,

485
00:31:08.652 --> 00:31:11.849
"Look, this doesn't mean anything.
We're just doing this for cash."

486
00:31:12.489 --> 00:31:14.855
- Oh, my God.
- What?

487
00:31:15.025 --> 00:31:18.791
You're just doing this because you've
always wanted to fuck me, aren't you?

488
00:31:19.563 --> 00:31:24.660
Yes. I've gone my whole life pretending
that I want nothing to do with you,

489
00:31:24.835 --> 00:31:28.134
just hoping one day
we'd be in such dire financial straits

490
00:31:28.305 --> 00:31:31.866
that I could use it
to finally make my move on you.

491
00:31:35.445 --> 00:31:37.675
<i>- You're just being sarcastic.</i>
- I am.

492
00:31:37.848 --> 00:31:40.544
See, I was pretending to cry
right there.

493
00:31:41.518 --> 00:31:44.510
<i>I guess it's not like it'd be creepy,</i>

494
00:31:44.688 --> 00:31:48.624
like if we got way too drunk one night
and accidentally fucked, you know?

495
00:31:48.792 --> 00:31:53.388
No. We'd be going in
with the understanding that it's...

496
00:31:53.563 --> 00:31:54.894
A business decision.

497
00:31:55.065 --> 00:31:57.625
Strictly a business decision.
It's a means to an end.

498
00:31:57.801 --> 00:31:59.234
- Right.
- And by end,

499
00:31:59.402 --> 00:32:01.563
I mean, I'll be waxing your ass.

500
00:32:01.738 --> 00:32:04.707
Fuck you.
I'm not even letting you see my ass.

501
00:32:04.875 --> 00:32:08.743
I've seen your ass and the rest of you
naked around a billion times already.

502
00:32:08.912 --> 00:32:11.574
- That goes both ways, buddy.
- You've never seen my dick.

503
00:32:11.748 --> 00:32:14.046
Have you seen my dick?
You've never seen my dick.

504
00:32:14.217 --> 00:32:17.277
Are you kidding? That party we went to
where you got blasted,

505
00:32:17.454 --> 00:32:19.547
and Houls dared you
to give yourself head,

506
00:32:19.723 --> 00:32:22.021
and we all watched you try for,
like, an hour.

507
00:32:22.192 --> 00:32:26.993
Oh, yeah. Thanks by the way, for
fucking letting me do that. Thank you.

508
00:32:27.164 --> 00:32:29.598
Oh, God. We really do know too much
about each other.

509
00:32:29.766 --> 00:32:33.361
See, and this would really
just be one more thing.

510
00:32:33.537 --> 00:32:37.371
I mean, look at us. It's Thanksgiving
and we're huddled around a flaming

511
00:32:37.541 --> 00:32:39.941
fucking garbage can
like a couple of steno bums.

512
00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:44.069
I mean, this could give us a chance
to pay off our debt, pay our bills,

513
00:32:44.247 --> 00:32:48.183
get a fucking nicer apartment
with heat in it maybe.

514
00:32:51.021 --> 00:32:52.682
What are you doing?

515
00:32:54.257 --> 00:32:59.354
Miriam Linky, will you have sex
with me on camera for money?

516
00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:08.333
I will.

517
00:33:09.272 --> 00:33:10.637
<i>- A producer?
- Yeah.</i>

518
00:33:10.807 --> 00:33:14.743
- Guy who gets to finance the movie.
- You think I got that kind of money?

519
00:33:14.911 --> 00:33:17.903
We just need that. What you're about
to spend on the flat screen.

520
00:33:18.081 --> 00:33:20.106
Now I can't get my flat screen?
Fuck that.

521
00:33:20.283 --> 00:33:24.219
No, no, no. With your cut of the profits,
you're gonna get two flat screens.

522
00:33:24.387 --> 00:33:26.651
One in your living room,
one in your bathroom.

523
00:33:26.823 --> 00:33:28.586
One in the bathroom?

524
00:33:29.192 --> 00:33:32.093
You know, it's always been my dream
to watch shit while I shit.

525
00:33:32.262 --> 00:33:34.890
Everyone with an ass
loves to watch shit while they shit.

526
00:33:35.065 --> 00:33:38.125
- I'm gonna make that happen for you.
- I don't know, man.

527
00:33:38.301 --> 00:33:39.768
What else the producer do?

528
00:33:40.036 --> 00:33:43.802
- Um, they help with the casting.
- What's casting?

529
00:33:43.974 --> 00:33:45.839
Finding the people to be in the movie.

530
00:33:46.009 --> 00:33:47.772
- I get to help pick the women?
- Yeah.

531
00:33:47.944 --> 00:33:51.311
Like, I can look at a titty, make sure
there ain't no moles on there?

532
00:33:51.481 --> 00:33:54.279
- You can look at both titties, man.
- Man.

533
00:33:54.451 --> 00:33:58.285
I've been looking at the same busted
titties for the past almost 20 years.

534
00:33:58.455 --> 00:34:03.017
- I'm due for another new titty.
- Please help us. Please.

535
00:34:03.193 --> 00:34:04.922
Please.

536
00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:09.998
Yes. Yes. I love you.

537
00:34:12.902 --> 00:34:14.597
Well, don't mind that smell.

538
00:34:14.771 --> 00:34:17.604
We had some homeless people
squatting in here.

539
00:34:17.774 --> 00:34:21.039
You know, they'd void their bowels
everywhere but the bathroom.

540
00:34:21.211 --> 00:34:25.841
Anyway, you pick up the poop
and you've got yourself a movie studio.

541
00:34:26.016 --> 00:34:27.745
Why don't we shoot
in your apartment?

542
00:34:27.917 --> 00:34:30.078
No power.
You wanna pay our electric bill?

543
00:34:30.253 --> 00:34:33.154
- You motherfuckers...
- We'll take it.

544
00:34:36.059 --> 00:34:38.323
<i>- Bring it back.</i>
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.

545
00:34:39.696 --> 00:34:42.722
<i>Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.</i>

546
00:34:42.899 --> 00:34:45.959
Oh, God. Come on.

547
00:34:46.736 --> 00:34:50.797
Why the fuck do I have to
do everything? Fuckers.

548
00:34:53.343 --> 00:34:55.675
<i>Hey, what is that?</i>

549
00:34:56.413 --> 00:35:01.043
<i>Fucking guys. This fucking
team, man. They fucking suck.</i>

550
00:35:02.485 --> 00:35:05.386
I'm gonna hatefuck
the shit out of you, ref.

551
00:35:05.555 --> 00:35:07.887
- Dude.
- It's cool.

552
00:35:08.058 --> 00:35:09.889
- He's my cousin.
- Hey.

553
00:35:10.827 --> 00:35:14.422
Didn't you used to videotape the varsity
basketball games in high school?

554
00:35:14.798 --> 00:35:18.564
Just the away games. I did it because
I was trying to fuck a cheerleader.

555
00:35:18.735 --> 00:35:19.759
Which one?

556
00:35:19.936 --> 00:35:23.804
Whichever one wanted to fuck the guy
who taped the varsity games.

557
00:35:24.074 --> 00:35:26.736
Still know how to work a camera?

558
00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:30.004
- Who cares what the title is?
- The porn I liked when I was a kid,

559
00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:32.842
it was always, like,
a spoof of a popular movie, you know?

560
00:35:33.016 --> 00:35:35.541
Like, um, Edward Penishands.

561
00:35:35.719 --> 00:35:39.587
Okay, so we need a mildly clever,
vaguely dirty title,

562
00:35:39.756 --> 00:35:41.348
that sounds like a real movie

563
00:35:41.524 --> 00:35:44.084
- and sums up what you're gonna see.
- Correct.

564
00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:46.387
An American Werewolf in Brenda?

565
00:35:46.563 --> 00:35:48.258
Fuckback Mountain?

566
00:35:49.432 --> 00:35:52.592
- Too soon? A Cock-in-Lips Now?
<i>- Next.</i>

567
00:35:52.769 --> 00:35:54.896
Cradle the balls. Work the shaft.

568
00:35:55.071 --> 00:35:58.063
Jerk my come-crayon
and let me color you white.

569
00:35:58.241 --> 00:36:00.641
I need cock and I need it now.

570
00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:02.277
I'm fucking you in the puss.

571
00:36:02.445 --> 00:36:04.640
I'm fucking you in the puss.

572
00:36:04.814 --> 00:36:06.941
It's "puss" as in pussy.

573
00:36:07.517 --> 00:36:11.419
Oh, because I was like,
who would wanna fuck puss?

574
00:36:11.588 --> 00:36:17.788
I want to slam my ham in your can,
woman. Scene.

575
00:36:17.961 --> 00:36:21.692
- This guy is amazing.
- This guy's great-looking too.

576
00:36:21.865 --> 00:36:23.127
I wanna fuck him.

577
00:36:23.299 --> 00:36:27.429
<i>Hi, my name's Delaney
and I'm a producer.</i>

578
00:36:27.604 --> 00:36:30.760
I really don't know what it means. I'm
gonna be honest, this is my first time.

579
00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:35.004
You don't have to worry, I'm not gonna
touch you or nothing like that.

580
00:36:35.178 --> 00:36:38.272
- All right.
- I have a wife, you know.

581
00:36:38.448 --> 00:36:42.908
We're happy. I mean, not happy,
but it's cool, you know.

582
00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:47.351
Just so you know,
there will be some fucking.

583
00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:51.253
- We'll talk about that if you get the part.
- Okay.

584
00:36:51.428 --> 00:36:54.556
I mean, not... We won't be fucking,
there'll be fucking in the movie.

585
00:36:54.731 --> 00:36:57.495
Like I said, I got a wife.
She don't play that shit.

586
00:36:57.667 --> 00:37:00.158
- She is a crazy bitch.
- Yep.

587
00:37:00.336 --> 00:37:04.966
It's my job as the producer
to see what you got.

588
00:37:05.442 --> 00:37:08.343
So if that makes you uncomfortable
in any way,

589
00:37:08.511 --> 00:37:14.609
you don't have to show me anything
you don't wanna show me, because...

590
00:37:15.985 --> 00:37:17.680
I love the movies.

591
00:37:17.854 --> 00:37:19.947
- Lawrence of a Labia.
- No.

592
00:37:20.123 --> 00:37:22.284
- Oh, come on.
- Dawn of the Dick.

593
00:37:22.459 --> 00:37:25.292
Yeah, but how are zombies doing it
at all sexy?

594
00:37:25.462 --> 00:37:28.260
I want to eat your brain

595
00:37:28.431 --> 00:37:30.490
and your ass.

596
00:37:32.001 --> 00:37:33.969
- Dude.
- Sci-fi.

597
00:37:34.137 --> 00:37:37.868
Yeah. Close Encounters
With a Turd From Behind.

598
00:37:38.041 --> 00:37:40.236
- I don't know what that means.
- Just asses.

599
00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:42.401
Fucking deep in asses.

600
00:37:46.349 --> 00:37:47.373
What?

601
00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:49.609
We're making a porno
and we just need to know

602
00:37:49.786 --> 00:37:53.153
what you would be or would not be
interested in doing.

603
00:37:53.323 --> 00:37:54.551
If anything.

604
00:37:55.425 --> 00:37:57.825
- No anal.
- Oh, definitely no anal.

605
00:37:57.994 --> 00:37:59.757
Anal and hugging.

606
00:37:59.929 --> 00:38:01.260
I don't do ass stuff.

607
00:38:01.431 --> 00:38:03.831
- Anal.
- Fuck.

608
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.265
- Oh, wait, oral. I like anal.
- Yay.

609
00:38:07.437 --> 00:38:10.770
Okay, well,
so, do you have any special skills?

610
00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:12.532
Special skills?

611
00:38:14.077 --> 00:38:16.773
I can get a boner really quick
and it sticks straight up.

612
00:38:16.946 --> 00:38:18.937
- Is that really a special skill?
- I think.

613
00:38:19.115 --> 00:38:21.879
- Can you show us what you mean?
- Sure.

614
00:38:29.859 --> 00:38:31.224
Oh, that is special.

615
00:38:32.929 --> 00:38:34.157
Yeah, you're hired, Mr...

616
00:38:34.330 --> 00:38:36.093
- Who are you again?
- Lester.

617
00:38:36.266 --> 00:38:38.757
Lester "The Molester" Cockinshtuff.

618
00:38:38.935 --> 00:38:39.959
- No.
- Wow.

619
00:38:40.136 --> 00:38:43.105
That is the best porn name
I've ever heard, man.

620
00:38:43.273 --> 00:38:44.604
I can have a porn name?

621
00:38:45.441 --> 00:38:49.275
- Then I'll be Pete Jones.
- Okay.

622
00:38:49.712 --> 00:38:51.111
Are you Granny Panties?

623
00:38:51.281 --> 00:38:53.306
- She is.
- Get the fuck out of here.

624
00:38:53.483 --> 00:38:55.041
The panties
are actually in the house.

625
00:38:55.218 --> 00:38:56.242
I'll get them.

626
00:38:56.419 --> 00:38:59.946
- <i>Star Sex 2: The Wrath of Cunt.
- We never made a Star Sex </i>

627
00:39:00.123 --> 00:39:02.785
I guess we can lose
<i>Star Sex 3: The Search for Cock,</i> then.

628
00:39:02.959 --> 00:39:04.824
- Cocunt.
- What's that?

629
00:39:04.994 --> 00:39:06.586
It's Cocoon with a cunt.

630
00:39:08.298 --> 00:39:12.496
So Delaney tells us
you have a special talent of some sort.

631
00:39:12.669 --> 00:39:15.137
I don't know if I'd call it
a special talent,

632
00:39:15.305 --> 00:39:18.832
but it's a little something I picked up
doing bachelor parties.

633
00:39:19.008 --> 00:39:21.738
It would probably be easier
if I just showed you.

634
00:39:22.378 --> 00:39:24.141
- Great.
- The floor is yours.

635
00:39:39.996 --> 00:39:42.931
So a movie, huh? That could be fun.

636
00:39:53.276 --> 00:39:55.267
Holy fuck.

637
00:39:59.849 --> 00:40:02.010
Her name, Bubbles.

638
00:40:02.652 --> 00:40:06.088
- Invasion of the Potty-Snatchers?
- That's like MAD Magazine stupid.

639
00:40:06.255 --> 00:40:10.214
Well, fuck you, okay? You try to think
of a good sci-fi porno title. It's hard.

640
00:40:10.393 --> 00:40:13.385
<i>There's gotta be one we haven't
thought of that would say it all,</i>

641
00:40:13.563 --> 00:40:15.554
not be ridiculously filthy
and off-putting,

642
00:40:15.732 --> 00:40:18.860
and still have instant recognition
with our audience.

643
00:40:20.503 --> 00:40:21.629
- I got it.
- I got it.

644
00:40:22.572 --> 00:40:25.439
- Star Whores.
- Yeah. It's funny, right?

645
00:40:25.608 --> 00:40:28.509
See, we figured this opens us up
to an even bigger sales market

646
00:40:28.678 --> 00:40:30.703
beyond the people we went
to school with.

647
00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:32.643
People who like comics and sci-fi.

648
00:40:32.815 --> 00:40:34.578
Comics? Like "Ziggy"?

649
00:40:34.751 --> 00:40:37.879
"Ziggy"? Is that even in fucking papers
anymore? No, man.

650
00:40:38.054 --> 00:40:41.023
Fuck you. "Ziggy" is a comic,
right next to "Family Circus."

651
00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:43.556
No, like Spider-Man and shit,
you know?

652
00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:47.327
There's always a shitload of Star Wars
nerds at those comic-book shows.

653
00:40:47.497 --> 00:40:50.955
So we sell them a Princess Leia
they can really fucking jerk off to.

654
00:40:51.134 --> 00:40:55.195
- That'd be me, Princess Lay-Her.
- Who am I playing?

655
00:40:55.371 --> 00:40:58.829
You, my friend,
are the lead role of Lubed Guy-Baller.

656
00:40:59.008 --> 00:41:00.566
Man, he's gonna be balling dudes?

657
00:41:00.743 --> 00:41:02.802
I thought you said
this was boys on girls.

658
00:41:02.979 --> 00:41:05.641
If I have to fuck a guy, okay,
but I'd rather fuck a girl.

659
00:41:05.815 --> 00:41:07.510
What's wrong with you, boy?

660
00:41:07.684 --> 00:41:11.051
- We'll change the name to Sky-Baller.
- Sky-Baller.

661
00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:13.279
I will be Hung So-low.

662
00:41:13.456 --> 00:41:17.187
Delaney, my friend,
you are On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.

663
00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:19.692
Man, I can't be in no porno.
My wife will kill me.

664
00:41:19.862 --> 00:41:23.229
Hump me, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
You're my only hump.

665
00:41:23.399 --> 00:41:25.299
On the other hand, fuck my wife.

666
00:41:25.468 --> 00:41:28.733
Unfortunately, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over
does not have any sex in the movie

667
00:41:28.905 --> 00:41:33.706
but the droids do,
I-CUP and R2-T-Bag.

668
00:41:33.876 --> 00:41:36.310
I robot.

669
00:41:36.479 --> 00:41:41.314
And Stacey over here
is gonna play Darth Vibrator.

670
00:41:41.484 --> 00:41:43.714
- I'm the bad guy?
- She's not a guy, Zack.

671
00:41:43.886 --> 00:41:46.184
I know that
because I'm not a fucking idiot.

672
00:41:46.355 --> 00:41:49.882
In our movie,
Darth Vibrator is a bad girl

673
00:41:50.059 --> 00:41:51.549
who wants to fuck the galaxy,

674
00:41:51.728 --> 00:41:56.097
literally, and it's up to Lubed and Hung
to stop her with their cocks.

675
00:41:56.265 --> 00:41:58.324
- You and me get to have sex, then?
- Yeah.

676
00:41:58.501 --> 00:42:01.095
- Cool.
- I know. Isn't that awesome?

677
00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:04.933
Hold up, hold up. So who's all having
sex with who in this movie?

678
00:42:05.108 --> 00:42:07.201
As of last night,
I was having sex with Zack.

679
00:42:07.376 --> 00:42:12.404
What? Han Solo ain't never had no sex
with Princess Leia in the Star Wars.

680
00:42:12.582 --> 00:42:15.050
<i>Guys, this isn't
a literal adaptation here.</i>

681
00:42:15.218 --> 00:42:18.312
It's more of an erotic re-imagining.

682
00:42:18.488 --> 00:42:22.083
Kind of like <i>The Wiz</i> or like a parody.
With lots of anal.

683
00:42:22.258 --> 00:42:24.920
- Cool.
- I know, isn't that awesome?

684
00:42:25.428 --> 00:42:29.489
I have a question, do Princess Lay-Her
and Lubed Sky-Baller have sex?

685
00:42:30.867 --> 00:42:33.802
No, because
they're brother and sister,

686
00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:36.632
and according to Miri,
brothers and sisters can't fuck.

687
00:42:36.806 --> 00:42:39.240
But you said,
that this wasn't a literal translation,

688
00:42:39.408 --> 00:42:43.310
so that means Lester's character
could have sex with Miri's character.

689
00:42:43.479 --> 00:42:47.609
Because I would love to fucking eat
her ass and fuck her silly in the movie.

690
00:42:47.784 --> 00:42:50.184
Dream on, pal,
it's never gonna happen, okay?

691
00:42:50.353 --> 00:42:53.186
- No, I'm fine with it.
- See, she's fine... Wait, what?

692
00:42:53.356 --> 00:42:56.450
Yep. I mean, everyone else is having
sex with more than one person

693
00:42:56.626 --> 00:42:58.389
in this movie all of a sudden,

694
00:42:58.561 --> 00:43:03.828
so I think it's, you know,
not fair if I'm only fucking you.

695
00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:07.492
Guys, read amongst yourselves, okay?
Can I talk to you for a sec?

696
00:43:08.137 --> 00:43:09.968
Look, Miri,

697
00:43:10.139 --> 00:43:13.575
we got plenty of sex going on in this
thing, you don't have to do that.

698
00:43:13.743 --> 00:43:17.304
Zack, it's fine. I mean I have slept
with way worse-looking guys than Lester.

699
00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:20.142
I just wanna do my part for the movie
like everyone else.

700
00:43:20.316 --> 00:43:23.444
You're having sex in the movie,
you don't need to fuck someone else.

701
00:43:23.619 --> 00:43:25.917
- You're good.
- I'm only fucking you, though.

702
00:43:26.088 --> 00:43:29.888
So don't we need to vary it up
to keep it fair?

703
00:43:30.059 --> 00:43:32.357
Fair for...? I don't... What?
Fair for who?

704
00:43:32.528 --> 00:43:34.894
What are these,
blood diamonds we're talking about?

705
00:43:35.064 --> 00:43:38.500
Fair for everyone else
who is fucking more than one person,

706
00:43:38.668 --> 00:43:40.568
a.k.a. you, in the movie.

707
00:43:40.736 --> 00:43:43.899
- I mean, fine...
- All right. I mean, if you don't care...

708
00:43:44.073 --> 00:43:47.008
I don't fucking care if you fuck him.
Fuck. I don't give a shit.

709
00:43:47.176 --> 00:43:50.168
Like you said, you know,
you've fucked bigger idiots than Lester.

710
00:43:50.346 --> 00:43:54.749
Holy shit. Are we really gonna
shoot this in outer space?

711
00:43:54.917 --> 00:43:56.441
Maybe not bigger idiots.

712
00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:45.667
Thank you.

713
00:45:10.726 --> 00:45:15.322
- Cut. All right, guys, that's it.
- Yeah.

714
00:45:15.498 --> 00:45:19.161
Make sure you leave your costume
so we know they're here for tomorrow.

715
00:45:19.335 --> 00:45:23.237
Mostly, everybody, thank you so much
for helping us get ready, you know.

716
00:45:23.406 --> 00:45:27.433
Cleaning this place out, building the
sets, sewing the costumes, it's just...

717
00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:29.441
I mean, it's really amazing. Thank you.

718
00:45:29.612 --> 00:45:30.943
<i>Seriously, thanks.</i>

719
00:45:31.113 --> 00:45:35.516
But this is just the beginning, guys.
If <i>Star Whores</i> works, and it will,

720
00:45:35.685 --> 00:45:39.121
we are set up for sequels galore.
<i>The Empire Strikes Ass</i>.

721
00:45:39.288 --> 00:45:41.984
<i>- Return of the Brown-Eye.
- The Phantom Man-Ass.</i>

722
00:45:42.158 --> 00:45:45.650
And <i>Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter</i>.

723
00:45:47.797 --> 00:45:50.163
- Okay.
- <i>Revenge of the Shit</i>.

724
00:45:50.766 --> 00:45:53.564
- You got it?
- Yeah, no, we got it.

725
00:45:55.104 --> 00:45:57.595
- Fuck you, motherfuckers.
- We'll talk about that one.

726
00:45:57.773 --> 00:46:00.173
We're gonna have a lot of fun,
but more importantly,

727
00:46:00.343 --> 00:46:02.243
we're gonna make
a lot of fucking money, okay?

728
00:46:02.411 --> 00:46:04.402
- Yeah.
- So get ready for greatness, people.

729
00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:06.241
Tomorrow we start
principal photography.

730
00:46:06.415 --> 00:46:08.576
Yeah.

731
00:46:08.884 --> 00:46:11.216
- All right, good night, you guys.
- We got a movie.

732
00:46:15.358 --> 00:46:17.223
- What?
- Nothing.

733
00:46:17.393 --> 00:46:21.124
I think someone should acknowledge
how insane and amazing this is

734
00:46:21.297 --> 00:46:24.528
- and it's all because of you.
- I don't know. It's just a porno.

735
00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:28.659
You know what I mean.
You've really come into your own.

736
00:46:29.905 --> 00:46:31.167
Shut the fuck up.

737
00:46:32.375 --> 00:46:36.402
So speaking of coming into things,
ready for tomorrow? Twenty years,

738
00:46:36.579 --> 00:46:39.446
we're finally gonna know what it's like
to have sex with each other.

739
00:46:39.615 --> 00:46:41.199
You say that like
you've been wondering

740
00:46:41.283 --> 00:46:43.376
what it'd be like to sleep with me
for a while now.

741
00:46:43.552 --> 00:46:46.180
Why the fuck do you think
I started hanging out with you?

742
00:46:46.355 --> 00:46:50.348
I knew it. Here, help.

743
00:46:53.929 --> 00:46:58.229
Let's just promise that it's not gonna
change anything between us, okay?

744
00:46:58.401 --> 00:46:59.522
- Like what?
- I don't know.

745
00:46:59.602 --> 00:47:01.797
Some guys
can't keep sex in perspective.

746
00:47:01.971 --> 00:47:04.667
If anyone's gotta keep this
in perspective, it's you, okay?

747
00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:07.809
I don't want you getting all mushy
and gooey on me

748
00:47:07.977 --> 00:47:10.445
after I give you the best orgasm
you've ever had.

749
00:47:10.613 --> 00:47:13.013
Oh, like you know what you're doing
down there at all.

750
00:47:13.182 --> 00:47:16.049
I actually don't. Where's the clitoris?
Is it in your ass?

751
00:47:16.218 --> 00:47:18.948
Just, you know,
make sure you kind of whoop it up

752
00:47:19.121 --> 00:47:23.455
and act like I'm a stud who knows
what he's doing, okay? Just be a pal.

753
00:47:23.626 --> 00:47:27.426
Oh, dude, I am gonna Meryl Streep the
fuck out of this tomorrow, you watch.

754
00:47:30.032 --> 00:47:33.229
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

755
00:47:33.402 --> 00:47:35.632
No. Really, thank you.

756
00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:39.608
For everything.

757
00:47:41.343 --> 00:47:43.277
You're welcome.

758
00:47:49.318 --> 00:47:52.048
Less than 12 hours
and we make Monroeville history.

759
00:47:52.221 --> 00:47:56.920
- I really hope nothing goes wrong.
- It's a movie. What could go wrong?

760
00:48:05.734 --> 00:48:07.929
<i>What are you doing?</i>

761
00:48:09.839 --> 00:48:12.000
<i>- What's up?</i>
- What the fuck?

762
00:48:12.174 --> 00:48:13.505
What are you doing?

763
00:48:13.676 --> 00:48:15.701
- What are you doing?
- Wait, wait.

764
00:48:15.878 --> 00:48:17.812
- Wait.
- Stop. Stop.

765
00:48:19.048 --> 00:48:22.176
- No, no, no.
- What the fuck is going on?

766
00:48:22.351 --> 00:48:25.445
Condos is what's going on,
as soon as this shit-hole's demo'd.

767
00:48:25.621 --> 00:48:27.088
No, you gotta stop it right now.

768
00:48:27.256 --> 00:48:29.622
We rented this place for a month
from Mr. Jenkins.

769
00:48:29.792 --> 00:48:31.987
Sounds like your Mr. Jenkins
was full of shit.

770
00:48:32.161 --> 00:48:34.629
Luxury Homesteads
bought this place a month ago.

771
00:48:34.797 --> 00:48:36.492
I'm gonna kill that lying old fuck.

772
00:48:36.665 --> 00:48:39.156
You're gonna have to go Florida,
that's where he moved.

773
00:48:39.335 --> 00:48:41.565
We've got thousands of dollars
of equipment in there.

774
00:48:41.737 --> 00:48:44.331
- Please.
- If you wanna sift through this rubble

775
00:48:44.507 --> 00:48:48.443
when we're done, be my guest.
Hey, get that fucking beam down.

776
00:49:05.794 --> 00:49:08.024
<i>This is the last thing
you wanna hear.</i>

777
00:49:08.197 --> 00:49:09.562
If you don't get an advance,

778
00:49:09.732 --> 00:49:12.200
I don't think we're gonna keep
a roof over our heads.

779
00:49:12.368 --> 00:49:16.099
I got an advance already.
It went into all the costumes.

780
00:49:16.272 --> 00:49:19.070
- So all our money's gone?
- All your money?

781
00:49:19.241 --> 00:49:22.733
Never mind what my wife's gonna do
when there ain't no new snow tires,

782
00:49:22.912 --> 00:49:25.847
or when she sees
I charged a video camera.

783
00:49:26.015 --> 00:49:27.880
I'm sorry I dragged you into this, man.

784
00:49:28.050 --> 00:49:29.950
<i>I just wanted to see
some free titties.</i>

785
00:49:30.586 --> 00:49:36.422
That's all. But there's no such thing
as free titties, is there, Zack?

786
00:49:37.526 --> 00:49:39.721
- Is there?
- Fuck this noise.

787
00:49:39.895 --> 00:49:42.591
Why don't we get another camera,
and shoot something else?

788
00:49:42.765 --> 00:49:45.199
Where are we gonna do that?
Got another sound stage?

789
00:49:45.367 --> 00:49:49.394
Sound stage? We had a shit-covered
garage we turned into a sound stage.

790
00:49:49.572 --> 00:49:52.234
We find some place new
and we do it again.

791
00:49:53.609 --> 00:49:55.042
How? Okay, I'm broke, man.

792
00:49:55.211 --> 00:49:59.705
No, make that, I was broke.
Now I am really tapped out.

793
00:49:59.882 --> 00:50:02.316
I have to get another job
to pay Delaney back.

794
00:50:02.484 --> 00:50:05.976
So please tell me,
how can I afford to start over?

795
00:50:06.155 --> 00:50:08.282
- What can I get you?
- Yeah, can I get a...?

796
00:50:08.457 --> 00:50:11.824
Too fucking late. Cappuccino, 3.50.

797
00:50:11.994 --> 00:50:13.962
I don't know
what the fuck I was thinking.

798
00:50:14.129 --> 00:50:19.294
I mean, I'm a total loser
in every single other aspect of my life.

799
00:50:19.468 --> 00:50:21.368
What made me think
I could do something

800
00:50:21.537 --> 00:50:23.334
as simple as filming people fucking?

801
00:50:23.505 --> 00:50:26.303
We have no money left,
nowhere to shoot, no sets,

802
00:50:26.475 --> 00:50:28.739
we have no fucking cameras. Here.

803
00:50:30.279 --> 00:50:33.112
It's time I go back to my regular life

804
00:50:33.282 --> 00:50:37.309
where I am a quiet fuckup
who doesn't cost anybody any money

805
00:50:37.486 --> 00:50:40.580
and knows his goddamn position
behind this fucking counter

806
00:50:40.756 --> 00:50:43.884
making cappuccinos
for this fucking guy.

807
00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:51.495
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

808
00:50:57.006 --> 00:50:58.667
What are you doing?

809
00:51:00.442 --> 00:51:01.875
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

810
00:51:02.478 --> 00:51:04.412
Yeah.

811
00:51:09.818 --> 00:51:11.649
Fuck, yes.

812
00:51:14.189 --> 00:51:15.213
Zack.

813
00:51:37.279 --> 00:51:42.148
You sneaky Indian motherfucker.
I tell you, yes.

814
00:51:43.352 --> 00:51:46.378
<i>Swallow My Cockuccino</i>.

815
00:51:46.555 --> 00:51:49.251
- What?
- That's it. That's the movie.

816
00:51:49.425 --> 00:51:52.952
Why didn't I think of it before?
We don't need sets or a stage.

817
00:51:53.128 --> 00:51:56.689
Look at all this production value,
waiting to have balls on it.

818
00:51:56.865 --> 00:51:59.561
Hold up. You wanna shoot
a dirty movie here, where we work?

819
00:51:59.735 --> 00:52:00.724
Yes.

820
00:52:00.903 --> 00:52:04.395
Fuck, yes, I do. You know how many
stories I have from working here?

821
00:52:04.573 --> 00:52:08.532
How many times I've been laid
right there after hours?

822
00:52:08.711 --> 00:52:10.420
You've never gotten laid here
after hours.

823
00:52:10.512 --> 00:52:12.605
I know. Thank you for reminding me.

824
00:52:12.781 --> 00:52:17.718
But I always wish I had,
and that's what porno is. It's fantasy.

825
00:52:17.886 --> 00:52:23.222
It's taking the normal
and making it abnormal by fucking it.

826
00:52:23.392 --> 00:52:25.792
Don't do that.
The little dog don't like that.

827
00:52:25.961 --> 00:52:27.394
How did you get a camera?

828
00:52:27.563 --> 00:52:31.431
By being a terrible, untrustworthy
employee, that's how.

829
00:52:32.134 --> 00:52:36.798
Give me today, I'll bang out a script.
Meet me back here after closing.

830
00:52:36.972 --> 00:52:42.137
We're gonna launch arching ropes of
jism all over this motherfucker. Peace.

831
00:52:43.912 --> 00:52:47.746
I like that guy but if he tries to
fuck that little dog tonight for real,

832
00:52:47.916 --> 00:52:50.077
I'm calling the Humane Society.

833
00:52:52.287 --> 00:52:56.223
It's called Bean-N-Gone,
so get the fuck out of here. Hey, Barry.

834
00:53:01.997 --> 00:53:05.057
<i>- Stand by, Stace, picture's up.</i>
- Okay.

835
00:53:05.234 --> 00:53:07.099
<i>Roll tape.</i>

836
00:53:09.938 --> 00:53:12.998
<i>Swallow My Cockuccino,</i>
Scene 12, Take 1.

837
00:53:20.916 --> 00:53:23.043
<i>And action.</i>

838
00:53:31.193 --> 00:53:34.788
I'd like a double espresso
so I can stay up all night

839
00:53:34.963 --> 00:53:37.488
because I'm in the mood to fuck.

840
00:53:37.666 --> 00:53:42.160
Well, I am a whore-ista, so I love
to fuck. Would you like to fuck me?

841
00:53:42.337 --> 00:53:46.330
Holy fuck. You mean,
after you're done with your shift?

842
00:53:46.508 --> 00:53:49.477
I mean during my shift.

843
00:53:50.345 --> 00:53:52.643
- Sorry.
- Keep going, keep going.

844
00:53:52.815 --> 00:53:55.215
With your shaft.

845
00:54:05.494 --> 00:54:09.260
Let us fuck.

846
00:54:13.268 --> 00:54:15.031
Cue music.

847
00:54:20.843 --> 00:54:23.243
Okay, open up to camera,
guys. Let us see it.

848
00:54:26.715 --> 00:54:27.909
More tongue.

849
00:54:31.019 --> 00:54:32.486
Little less tongue.

850
00:54:36.825 --> 00:54:38.759
Oh, that was good.

851
00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:45.558
Cue effects.

852
00:55:02.918 --> 00:55:05.318
Oh, yeah, like that.

853
00:55:05.487 --> 00:55:07.580
Oh, yeah.

854
00:55:08.757 --> 00:55:11.817
See, I told you it would work.
Didn't I tell you? It looks amazing.

855
00:55:11.994 --> 00:55:13.518
It's incredible.

856
00:55:14.096 --> 00:55:16.758
<i>Oh, the beans hurt. Easy.</i>

857
00:55:17.065 --> 00:55:19.932
- Move in for coverage.
- Nice.

858
00:55:20.302 --> 00:55:21.360
That's why we got him.

859
00:55:21.537 --> 00:55:24.802
- Nice. I'm impressed.
- Get in there, Deacon.

860
00:55:24.973 --> 00:55:28.306
- Come on.
- Like that? Like that.

861
00:55:28.477 --> 00:55:32.072
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah. Look at that.

862
00:55:32.247 --> 00:55:34.112
- Pull out a bit, actually.
<i>- That's hot.</i>

863
00:55:34.283 --> 00:55:36.217
No, not you, Lester. Put it back in.

864
00:55:36.385 --> 00:55:37.875
Kiss the muscle.

865
00:55:38.487 --> 00:55:40.455
- I kiss the muscle.
- You kiss the muscle.

866
00:55:41.156 --> 00:55:44.216
- Can he slap her ass a little?
- Don't be a fucking pervert, dude.

867
00:55:44.393 --> 00:55:48.329
- Stir, come on. Stir.
- Yeah, stir it.

868
00:55:48.730 --> 00:55:51.426
Stir it, baby.

869
00:56:00.242 --> 00:56:01.402
Hey.

870
00:56:02.778 --> 00:56:04.245
- Holy.
- Shit.

871
00:56:04.413 --> 00:56:06.608
Are you guys still open?

872
00:56:08.183 --> 00:56:12.119
No. We close at 9.

873
00:56:12.955 --> 00:56:15.150
I need coffee so I'm drive home.

874
00:56:15.624 --> 00:56:18.752
- Okay. Yeah.
<i>- Thank you.</i>

875
00:56:20.095 --> 00:56:22.256
That's a cute kitty.

876
00:56:22.931 --> 00:56:24.091
Okay.

877
00:56:31.340 --> 00:56:32.364
Hey.

878
00:56:32.541 --> 00:56:34.202
- Hey.
- Hey.

879
00:56:34.376 --> 00:56:38.142
You guys see the game? I was at it.

880
00:56:38.313 --> 00:56:43.683
Fucking Roethlisberger,
the quarterback, was all fucking,

881
00:56:43.852 --> 00:56:49.620
"Hug it, chug it, football. All night."

882
00:56:49.791 --> 00:56:52.123
Okay, pal, here you go.
On the house.

883
00:56:52.461 --> 00:56:54.656
- I love you.
- I love you too. Have a good one.

884
00:56:54.830 --> 00:56:58.095
- Yeah, I'll have a cold one.
- I said, have a good one.

885
00:57:00.202 --> 00:57:02.966
- Okay. Keep moving.
<i>- You and your little dog.</i>

886
00:57:03.839 --> 00:57:06.000
Go Steelers.

887
00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:13.142
Action.

888
00:57:13.649 --> 00:57:17.676
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, like that.

889
00:57:17.853 --> 00:57:22.722
Oh, fuck it, chuck it, football.
Oh, yeah.

890
00:57:23.091 --> 00:57:24.422
<i>Oh, God, this is good.</i>

891
00:57:27.062 --> 00:57:33.365
You take it. You take it.
Take it, Barry. Oh, take it.

892
00:57:33.535 --> 00:57:36.527
Take it, Barry. Take it.

893
00:57:37.372 --> 00:57:40.739
I'm disturbed
at how turned on I am by this.

894
00:57:41.843 --> 00:57:43.470
- Shit, dude, it's almost 6.
- Oh, fuck.

895
00:57:43.645 --> 00:57:45.738
Okay, that's a wrap,
everybody, yeah.

896
00:57:45.914 --> 00:57:48.906
Let's give a hand to our hotties
with the bodies from last night.

897
00:57:49.084 --> 00:57:51.575
Stacey, Lester, Bubbles, Barry.

898
00:57:51.753 --> 00:57:52.845
<i>- Yeah.
- Nice.</i>

899
00:57:53.021 --> 00:57:54.818
Okay, when we come back tonight,

900
00:57:54.990 --> 00:57:58.824
we finish up the venti-vulva scene, and
then we get into me and Miri's stuff.

901
00:57:58.994 --> 00:58:02.691
Again, amazing first night, everybody.
Thank you so much.

902
00:58:05.801 --> 00:58:07.996
Let us fuck.

903
00:58:11.173 --> 00:58:13.505
- Hey, how'd it look?
- How do you think it looked?

904
00:58:13.675 --> 00:58:17.111
It looked like shit going into other shit,
in focus.

905
00:58:17.279 --> 00:58:20.908
What an artist. That was Kurosawa's
motto. "Shit going into other shit."

906
00:58:21.083 --> 00:58:23.244
Oh, man,
I can't believe you gotta work now.

907
00:58:23.418 --> 00:58:26.216
It's okay. You know, honestly,
I don't think I could sleep.

908
00:58:26.388 --> 00:58:29.721
- I'm pretty, like, pumped up right now.
- Right? It was amazing.

909
00:58:29.891 --> 00:58:31.880
It was awesome.
I think the cast and crew had a good time.

910
00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:34.485
- We were getting great shit.
- Yeah, it was so fun.

911
00:58:34.663 --> 00:58:37.097
I just wanna keep shooting
people boning all day.

912
00:58:37.466 --> 00:58:40.663
I don't think I've ever met
the ambitious Zack Brown before.

913
00:58:41.336 --> 00:58:44.601
- Well, I'm trying to pay the bills, so...
- It's not a bad thing.

914
00:58:45.807 --> 00:58:47.968
I think it looks good on you.

915
00:59:34.790 --> 00:59:39.159
<i>Come on, hurry.
Come on, come on, come on.</i>

916
00:59:40.262 --> 00:59:41.388
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

917
00:59:41.563 --> 00:59:43.963
- You guys never did it before?
<i>- It's fine.</i>

918
00:59:44.432 --> 00:59:49.597
You know, we talked about it
and it's just for the movie.

919
00:59:49.771 --> 00:59:51.762
We're friends, you know,
we're just friends.

920
00:59:51.940 --> 00:59:55.808
And we will always just be
just friends, so...

921
00:59:55.977 --> 00:59:59.344
Listen, I have some extra lube
from last night.

922
00:59:59.514 --> 01:00:02.915
I understand it's kind of hard getting
wet when everyone's watching.

923
01:00:03.084 --> 01:00:04.915
At least it was for Barry.

924
01:00:05.086 --> 01:00:08.021
- I don't know if I am gonna need it.
- Really?

925
01:00:08.190 --> 01:00:11.648
Yeah, I think I'm just excited.

926
01:00:13.829 --> 01:00:16.389
At the idea of people watching,
not because of Zack.

927
01:00:16.565 --> 01:00:19.693
Oh, God. Zack could never have that
effect on me in a million years.

928
01:00:19.868 --> 01:00:22.428
- Hello, Miriam.
- Oh, hey.

929
01:00:22.604 --> 01:00:23.628
Wow.

930
01:00:23.805 --> 01:00:25.602
- Your face.
- Yeah. Weird, huh?

931
01:00:25.774 --> 01:00:28.174
I don't think I've seen your face
since senior year.

932
01:00:28.343 --> 01:00:29.503
<i>I think I made a mistake.</i>

933
01:00:29.678 --> 01:00:32.613
I did it for you so you wouldn't
get road rash during our scene,

934
01:00:32.781 --> 01:00:35.944
but I should have asked first,
I look like a fucking beluga whale.

935
01:00:36.351 --> 01:00:38.945
I think I'll be going now.

936
01:00:40.355 --> 01:00:42.016
<i>Okay.</i>

937
01:00:48.763 --> 01:00:51.163
All I keep thinking is
we should've done a trial run

938
01:00:51.333 --> 01:00:52.800
at home last week or something.

939
01:00:52.968 --> 01:00:54.731
- Oh, my God. Right?
- I know.

940
01:00:56.972 --> 01:01:02.274
- You're still cool to do it, though, right?
- Yeah, um. Totally. Are you?

941
01:01:02.444 --> 01:01:04.571
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know, I'm...

942
01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:07.414
- Honestly, I'm a little nervous, I guess.
- You are?

943
01:01:07.582 --> 01:01:09.880
- It's kind of a big deal.
- It is?

944
01:01:10.051 --> 01:01:13.987
Yeah, you know,
it's our first time together

945
01:01:15.390 --> 01:01:19.656
since our auspicious debut
on viral video.

946
01:01:20.795 --> 01:01:21.887
Oh, yeah.

947
01:01:22.063 --> 01:01:24.293
That's a fuckload of pressure
for a director.

948
01:01:24.799 --> 01:01:28.326
As a director, please. What about
the anxiety I'm feeling as an actress?

949
01:01:28.503 --> 01:01:31.836
- Did I pick the right project?
- Yeah. What about this follow-up?

950
01:01:32.007 --> 01:01:34.999
Julia Roberts followed <i>Pretty Woman</i>
with <i>Sleeping With the Enemy</i>.

951
01:01:35.176 --> 01:01:38.111
I'm following <i>Granny Panties</i>
with <i>Swallow My Cockuccino</i>.

952
01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:40.544
Only difference is
this movie's about cock-sucking

953
01:01:40.715 --> 01:01:42.774
and her movie just sucked cock,
period.

954
01:01:42.951 --> 01:01:45.977
- The only difference, yeah.
- The end was pretty rad.

955
01:01:46.621 --> 01:01:48.521
I liked that.

956
01:01:50.058 --> 01:01:52.583
- When she kills him.
- With a gun.

957
01:01:52.761 --> 01:01:53.887
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

958
01:01:54.062 --> 01:01:56.462
- She calls the cops first.
- She calls it in first.

959
01:01:56.631 --> 01:01:58.496
- It was so awesome.
- Awesome, yeah.

960
01:02:00.769 --> 01:02:03.033
So I guess we should do this.

961
01:02:03.204 --> 01:02:07.607
I think we should probably wait just
until I lose another 20 or 30 pounds.

962
01:02:07.776 --> 01:02:10.677
Stop it. You look good.

963
01:02:10.845 --> 01:02:12.369
Thanks.

964
01:02:14.015 --> 01:02:17.781
So, what about me? How do I look?

965
01:02:18.987 --> 01:02:22.650
I mean, you look beautiful.
You always look so beautiful,

966
01:02:22.824 --> 01:02:27.022
so I guess it's not a big deal,
but you look amazing.

967
01:02:35.470 --> 01:02:39.201
- Okay. Let's go make a porno.
- Okay.

968
01:02:40.342 --> 01:02:44.210
<i>Swallow My Cockuccino,</i>
Scene 8, Take 1.

969
01:02:44.379 --> 01:02:46.847
<i>- Come here.</i>
- I'm over...?

970
01:02:47.515 --> 01:02:49.380
All right, settle.

971
01:02:50.151 --> 01:02:51.584
Action.

972
01:02:53.188 --> 01:02:55.554
Who could it be?

973
01:03:02.797 --> 01:03:03.957
- Hi.
- Hi.

974
01:03:04.132 --> 01:03:07.590
I'm a delivery man
and I have some cream for you.

975
01:03:07.769 --> 01:03:11.261
Wow, that cream looks heavy.
You must be strong.

976
01:03:11.439 --> 01:03:12.872
I work out.

977
01:03:13.041 --> 01:03:17.239
So do you want me
to give you your cream now?

978
01:03:17.412 --> 01:03:21.178
I've been waiting for it all day.

979
01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:23.274
- Fuck. Come on.
- Oops.

980
01:03:23.451 --> 01:03:25.009
Keep going.

981
01:03:25.186 --> 01:03:29.623
I spilled my cream. Do you mind?

982
01:03:29.791 --> 01:03:35.127
I don't mind.
Especially if you spill it on my face.

983
01:03:35.563 --> 01:03:37.622
Let us fuck.

984
01:03:43.872 --> 01:03:45.931
- Fix my shirt. Think I should?
- Okay.

985
01:03:46.107 --> 01:03:49.201
Let me see them titties.

986
01:03:49.644 --> 01:03:52.704
Actually, you know what? Sorry,
I don't think we should show them.

987
01:03:52.881 --> 01:03:55.179
- What?
- We shouldn't show your breasts.

988
01:03:55.350 --> 01:03:58.410
- Aren't you gonna take your shirt off?
- I'm just gonna open it.

989
01:03:58.586 --> 01:04:00.349
You're not gonna take it off? Why not?

990
01:04:00.522 --> 01:04:03.457
My tits are bigger than yours.
I don't wanna show that.

991
01:04:03.625 --> 01:04:06.594
She's not gonna show her tits?
I showed my cock and my asshole.

992
01:04:06.761 --> 01:04:09.093
- Okay, I'll do your pants.
- Back and forth. Okay.

993
01:04:09.264 --> 01:04:11.664
- Holy shit.
- Where's that delivery?

994
01:04:11.833 --> 01:04:17.100
I can't believe this. I was delivering
cream, and look what's happening.

995
01:04:17.272 --> 01:04:21.072
- Jesus, what is that, a rumba?
- What's a rumba?

996
01:04:21.242 --> 01:04:23.176
That awkward movement.

997
01:04:24.846 --> 01:04:27.838
- Should I take your underpants off?
- Yeah, take them off.

998
01:04:30.819 --> 01:04:32.286
<i>What the fuck?
How does this work?</i>

999
01:04:32.454 --> 01:04:34.388
They're just like... I'll do it.

1000
01:04:34.556 --> 01:04:37.491
- I'll do mine, you just... You do yours.
- I'll do my pants.

1001
01:04:46.401 --> 01:04:48.631
Granny panties.

1002
01:04:50.505 --> 01:04:52.336
Just get on with it already.

1003
01:04:53.641 --> 01:04:55.506
I'm gonna fuck you with my pecker.

1004
01:04:55.677 --> 01:04:57.474
Dude, that's really dirty.

1005
01:04:57.645 --> 01:04:59.636
- That's too dirty?
- That offends me.

1006
01:04:59.814 --> 01:05:01.714
- Penis?
- Fine.

1007
01:05:01.883 --> 01:05:05.046
- I'm gonna fuck you with my penis.
- I can't wait.

1008
01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:07.051
For my penis.

1009
01:05:07.222 --> 01:05:10.658
Be careful, Miri. Okay, there we go.
Just keep rolling, keep rolling.

1010
01:05:10.825 --> 01:05:15.489
- I'll walk forward.
- Fucking cream is coming.

1011
01:05:18.133 --> 01:05:21.193
This is the worst porno
I've ever seen.

1012
01:05:21.603 --> 01:05:27.200
<i>- Get over here, delivery man.
- Let's fuck on these beans.</i>

1013
01:05:29.410 --> 01:05:30.434
- You okay?
- Yup.

1014
01:05:30.612 --> 01:05:33.945
<i>- Okay, all right.</i>
- Just leave them. Just leave them.

1015
01:05:34.115 --> 01:05:36.583
- They're really distracting.
- You should leave them.

1016
01:05:36.751 --> 01:05:39.015
- You gotta get your... There you go.
<i>- Okay, okay.</i>

1017
01:05:39.187 --> 01:05:41.485
- Okay, okay.
- Okay. This okay?

1018
01:05:45.493 --> 01:05:47.051
Okay.

1019
01:05:47.228 --> 01:05:48.661
Okay.

1020
01:05:49.063 --> 01:05:51.930
- We'll start kissing on three, okay?
- Okay.

1021
01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:55.661
One, two, three. Go.

1022
01:06:19.294 --> 01:06:21.194
<i>I'm ready.</i>

1023
01:06:22.096 --> 01:06:25.623
- I'm ready.
- Okay.

1024
01:06:34.742 --> 01:06:35.800
Deacon.

1025
01:06:35.977 --> 01:06:38.207
- Deacon. Deacon.
- What?

1026
01:06:38.379 --> 01:06:41.780
Did you see <i>Lost</i> this week, man?
I missed it. What happened?

1027
01:06:41.950 --> 01:06:44.885
They're on the island, off the island.
Who can follow that?

1028
01:06:45.053 --> 01:06:46.179
I think they're in hell.

1029
01:06:46.354 --> 01:06:48.151
Would you all shut the motherfuck up?

1030
01:07:03.137 --> 01:07:04.764
I want you to come.

1031
01:07:04.939 --> 01:07:07.908
- I want you to come with me.
- Okay.

1032
01:07:12.814 --> 01:07:15.044
Oh, God.

1033
01:07:30.598 --> 01:07:32.657
<i>Oh, God.</i>

1034
01:07:45.446 --> 01:07:46.606
Cut.

1035
01:07:46.781 --> 01:07:51.514
That's it? It's over? Ain't he
supposed to come on her titties?

1036
01:07:56.624 --> 01:07:59.252
Well, it wasn't what we'd shot-listed,
but that was nice.

1037
01:07:59.427 --> 01:08:02.055
- It was so romantic.
- Way to fuck, Zack.

1038
01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:04.425
Thanks, Lester.

1039
01:08:04.632 --> 01:08:08.295
It wasn't just me, though, guys. Give
it up for my radiant costar here, Miri.

1040
01:08:09.671 --> 01:08:11.832
<i>- Nice.</i>
- Um, show's over in here.

1041
01:08:12.006 --> 01:08:14.099
Let's move out,
start lighting the next scene.

1042
01:08:14.275 --> 01:08:16.004
- All right.
<i>- Let's do it.</i>

1043
01:08:16.844 --> 01:08:18.778
<i>- You looked so beautiful.</i>
- Thanks.

1044
01:08:18.946 --> 01:08:20.846
<i>I thought they were gonna
be fucking hard.</i>

1045
01:08:21.015 --> 01:08:22.676
- It was pretty.
<i>- Pretty don't sell.</i>

1046
01:08:22.850 --> 01:08:24.875
- Good job.
- Thanks.

1047
01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:28.150
You good, Mir? You need anything?

1048
01:08:28.323 --> 01:08:30.223
I'm just gonna take a minute, okay?

1049
01:08:30.391 --> 01:08:33.758
Okay. I'll just be out there.

1050
01:08:34.562 --> 01:08:36.052
Yeah.

1051
01:08:37.632 --> 01:08:41.159
- That was fun.
- Yeah, fun.

1052
01:08:43.037 --> 01:08:45.505
<i>"Fun." You fucking douche.</i>

1053
01:09:11.299 --> 01:09:12.630
Wow.

1054
01:09:28.149 --> 01:09:29.616
- Hey.
<i>- Hey.</i>

1055
01:09:29.784 --> 01:09:32.617
- You working on a rewrite?
- Yeah, just for tonight's scene.

1056
01:09:32.787 --> 01:09:35.381
- I'm ready to go when you are, though.
- Okay.

1057
01:09:37.125 --> 01:09:43.997
You know, before we go, I...
I'm thinking that, it's a good idea

1058
01:09:44.565 --> 01:09:46.499
if we talk about
what happened last night.

1059
01:09:48.236 --> 01:09:50.932
I mean, we don't have to, but I think...

1060
01:09:51.105 --> 01:09:52.265
Okay, yeah.

1061
01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:54.440
I kind of dropped the ball on that,
I guess, huh?

1062
01:09:54.609 --> 01:09:58.477
- No, no. It's...
- To be honest, it was...

1063
01:09:58.646 --> 01:10:01.240
You know, I didn't realize
how weird it would be for me.

1064
01:10:01.416 --> 01:10:04.146
Weird? Like... Weird how?

1065
01:10:04.786 --> 01:10:08.415
Acting and directing at the same time.
It's a lot to process, you know.

1066
01:10:08.589 --> 01:10:12.355
For the first time, I thought my balls
didn't have enough hair on them.

1067
01:10:12.527 --> 01:10:14.017
That's not what I meant.

1068
01:10:15.797 --> 01:10:17.822
I know what you meant.

1069
01:10:17.999 --> 01:10:19.694
How you feeling about it?

1070
01:10:20.368 --> 01:10:22.268
I guess,

1071
01:10:23.771 --> 01:10:24.931
I feel like...

1072
01:10:26.674 --> 01:10:27.698
Like we...

1073
01:10:29.310 --> 01:10:32.643
- Holy fuck.
- The power's on. Did you do this?

1074
01:10:32.814 --> 01:10:34.805
<i>How did this happen?
I burned the bills.</i>

1075
01:10:34.982 --> 01:10:36.449
How could we have done that?

1076
01:10:36.617 --> 01:10:38.175
- The water.
- The water.

1077
01:10:38.986 --> 01:10:41.454
<i>Come on, come on, come on.</i>

1078
01:10:41.622 --> 01:10:42.953
Yeah!

1079
01:10:43.124 --> 01:10:45.820
- We can shower in our home again.
- We are liquid.

1080
01:10:51.699 --> 01:10:52.723
Greetings.

1081
01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:56.233
Have you heard the good news about
our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ?

1082
01:10:56.404 --> 01:10:58.031
Oh, my God, did you guys do this?

1083
01:10:58.206 --> 01:11:01.073
We got tired of you taking showers
at our places all the time.

1084
01:11:01.242 --> 01:11:03.335
So we took up a collection
amongst ourselves.

1085
01:11:03.511 --> 01:11:05.411
And chipped away
at your mountain of debt.

1086
01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:07.673
You guys paid off
our massive utilities bills?

1087
01:11:07.849 --> 01:11:10.909
- How did you afford that?
- I stole my old lady's bingo winnings.

1088
01:11:11.085 --> 01:11:13.451
And Mistress Bubbles
did a bachelor party tonight

1089
01:11:13.621 --> 01:11:16.852
at which yours truly was a guest star,
thank you very much.

1090
01:11:18.326 --> 01:11:22.092
Don't get too excited. We didn't pay off
your whole bill. Just a month of each.

1091
01:11:22.263 --> 01:11:24.163
They agreed
to turn everything back on?

1092
01:11:24.332 --> 01:11:26.027
At 9 at night? How does that work?

1093
01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:28.964
Stacey knows somebody
that works at Power and Light.

1094
01:11:29.136 --> 01:11:31.104
- You guys...
- This is amazing.

1095
01:11:31.272 --> 01:11:32.762
You didn't have to do this.

1096
01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:34.771
You didn't have to put us
in your movie.

1097
01:11:34.942 --> 01:11:36.807
- Or let us shoot it.
- Or produce it.

1098
01:11:36.978 --> 01:11:39.606
- Or put us in your movie either.
- We said that already.

1099
01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:41.907
Guys, honestly,
I don't know what to say.

1100
01:11:42.083 --> 01:11:44.210
You can start by saying
we can take tonight off

1101
01:11:44.385 --> 01:11:46.615
so we can have our wrap party
right now.

1102
01:11:46.787 --> 01:11:49.950
Guys, we're not wrapped.
We still have four days of shooting left.

1103
01:11:50.124 --> 01:11:52.786
Excuse me.
In my "producorial" capacity,

1104
01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:56.691
I'm shutting the movie down for a night
so we can get a little silly.

1105
01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:41.798
Go, go, go.

1106
01:12:41.976 --> 01:12:44.035
- Yes.
- Yes.

1107
01:12:45.580 --> 01:12:46.877
You all drink.

1108
01:12:47.048 --> 01:12:50.506
Was it just amazing with him,
after all those years of not knowing?

1109
01:12:50.685 --> 01:12:53.882
It was, um, weird.

1110
01:12:54.789 --> 01:12:57.121
- But good.
- My scene with Zack's tomorrow.

1111
01:12:57.291 --> 01:12:58.690
You don't say.

1112
01:12:58.859 --> 01:13:03.523
But I'm a little nervous. I was thinking
about trying to get with him tonight.

1113
01:13:03.698 --> 01:13:06.223
- Really?
- I mean, if you don't mind.

1114
01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:09.597
You are just friends and all,
so I didn't think it would be a biggie.

1115
01:13:09.770 --> 01:13:12.034
- It wouldn't be a biggie, would it?
- No.

1116
01:13:12.974 --> 01:13:16.967
No, no. It's not a biggie. What? No.

1117
01:13:17.144 --> 01:13:18.668
Are you sure?

1118
01:13:18.846 --> 01:13:21.542
Yeah. Stacey,
I'm not married to the guy, so...

1119
01:13:21.716 --> 01:13:26.710
I don't know. You guys just looked
kind of intimate last night.

1120
01:13:26.887 --> 01:13:29.355
- We did?
- Yeah.

1121
01:13:33.661 --> 01:13:39.691
Well, we're just better actors than
I thought, I think, so you know what?

1122
01:13:39.867 --> 01:13:43.064
If you wanna get with him,
you should just go ask him.

1123
01:13:43.237 --> 01:13:46.968
- He'd be really excited to hear that.
- Yeah? For real, you don't mind?

1124
01:13:47.141 --> 01:13:50.167
- Yeah.
- Cool.

1125
01:13:54.448 --> 01:13:57.349
<i>All the quarters
are on the ground.</i>

1126
01:13:58.052 --> 01:14:00.850
<i>- Hey, Stace.</i>
- Hey, Zack.

1127
01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:08.822
<i>Come on,
are you guys playing or what?</i>

1128
01:15:49.697 --> 01:15:52.165
Well, I'm bummed, but I totally get it.

1129
01:15:52.333 --> 01:15:55.564
It's no problem to work
with Lester again. He has a nice cock.

1130
01:15:55.736 --> 01:15:57.397
Well, you're a trouper, Stace.

1131
01:15:57.571 --> 01:16:00.836
Oh, but if I start making weird faces
or anything during the scene,

1132
01:16:01.008 --> 01:16:03.602
it's just because
I've been constipated all day.

1133
01:16:03.778 --> 01:16:06.747
Oh, shit. We don't have
to shoot the scene tonight.

1134
01:16:06.914 --> 01:16:09.474
No, I want to. Anal's great
for when you're constipated.

1135
01:16:09.650 --> 01:16:11.982
It totally loosens you up.

1136
01:16:12.686 --> 01:16:15.519
I use ex-lax, but good to know.

1137
01:16:15.689 --> 01:16:19.216
Okay, I never thought
I would have that conversation.

1138
01:16:19.393 --> 01:16:21.657
So are we starting
with Lester and Stacey tonight?

1139
01:16:21.829 --> 01:16:23.746
We were supposed to start
with Lester and Miri.

1140
01:16:23.864 --> 01:16:26.698
I know. She... We're not gonna do that.
I don't think Miri's gonna...

1141
01:16:34.642 --> 01:16:36.234
...do that.

1142
01:16:39.013 --> 01:16:42.744
Hey. So where are we shooting this?
Over here?

1143
01:16:43.484 --> 01:16:46.351
- What are you doing here?
- Me and Lester.

1144
01:16:47.721 --> 01:16:49.848
Our scene's tonight, right?

1145
01:16:51.926 --> 01:16:54.451
Can I talk to you for a minute
in the back?

1146
01:16:54.962 --> 01:16:58.056
- Sure.
- Thanks.

1147
01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:01.495
What do you want me to shoot here?

1148
01:17:01.669 --> 01:17:05.105
Start with the close-ups of Lester
and Stacey. Give me a second, man.

1149
01:17:05.806 --> 01:17:06.864
What an artist.

1150
01:17:07.608 --> 01:17:11.374
Okay. Did I do something
wrong to you?

1151
01:17:11.545 --> 01:17:12.569
No.

1152
01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:14.372
Then why are you here?

1153
01:17:14.548 --> 01:17:17.779
I'm here for the same reason
you're here. To make the movie.

1154
01:17:18.419 --> 01:17:21.946
Okay, just, like,
for your own personal information,

1155
01:17:22.823 --> 01:17:24.688
you're acting really weird right now.

1156
01:17:24.859 --> 01:17:27.419
I'm acting weird?
I think you're acting weird right now.

1157
01:17:27.595 --> 01:17:29.825
Oh, I'm acting...
How exactly am I acting weird?

1158
01:17:29.997 --> 01:17:32.659
You've been trying to keep me
from fucking anybody but you

1159
01:17:32.833 --> 01:17:34.801
since we started this thing.

1160
01:17:35.436 --> 01:17:38.405
Maybe I was thinking
about your feelings.

1161
01:17:38.572 --> 01:17:41.439
Were you thinking of my feelings
when you were banging Stacey?

1162
01:17:41.609 --> 01:17:43.975
Because that'd be really sad
for Stacey.

1163
01:17:44.144 --> 01:17:46.942
She told me that you told her that
that was okay.

1164
01:17:47.114 --> 01:17:52.245
I told her that it was okay to ask you.

1165
01:17:54.088 --> 01:17:58.422
Holy shit. I get it. I fucking get it.

1166
01:17:58.592 --> 01:18:01.652
It was a test. That whole thing
was a fucking test, is that it?

1167
01:18:02.563 --> 01:18:04.622
If it was, how do you think you did?

1168
01:18:05.466 --> 01:18:06.694
We had a discussion, Miri.

1169
01:18:06.867 --> 01:18:13.102
We had... Actually, we had many
discussions about how it was just sex

1170
01:18:13.274 --> 01:18:16.175
- and how we wouldn't let it get weird.
- I'm not acting weird.

1171
01:18:16.343 --> 01:18:20.109
You're acting like a jealous girlfriend
is what the fuck you're acting like.

1172
01:18:20.281 --> 01:18:22.181
- I am not your girlfriend.
- I know that.

1173
01:18:22.349 --> 01:18:26.080
You're not my boyfriend, so why are
we having this conversation right now?

1174
01:18:26.253 --> 01:18:30.349
Because you're about to fuck Lester
to spite me, it seems like.

1175
01:18:30.524 --> 01:18:32.890
Did you fuck Stacey to spite me? No.

1176
01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:35.255
You fucked her
like you fucked every other bitch

1177
01:18:35.429 --> 01:18:37.522
and never gave a shit
how I felt about it.

1178
01:18:38.032 --> 01:18:40.296
- Well, that was before.
- Before what?

1179
01:18:40.467 --> 01:18:44.801
Look, don't fucking pretend that the
other night, you and me, right there,

1180
01:18:44.972 --> 01:18:48.100
that that didn't mean anything to you,
that you didn't feel it too.

1181
01:18:48.275 --> 01:18:52.678
You're not getting all gooey
on me here, are you, Zack?

1182
01:18:53.047 --> 01:18:54.446
You know what?

1183
01:18:54.615 --> 01:18:57.584
If you were any other bitch
I didn't give a rat's ass about,

1184
01:18:57.751 --> 01:18:59.844
I would tell you
to go fuck yourself right now

1185
01:19:00.020 --> 01:19:03.478
because I fucking hate
this game-playing shit.

1186
01:19:03.657 --> 01:19:05.648
But you,
you mean more to me than that,

1187
01:19:05.826 --> 01:19:08.226
so I'm just gonna lay this out
on front street.

1188
01:19:08.395 --> 01:19:11.523
I know you felt something big,
something real the other night

1189
01:19:11.699 --> 01:19:14.429
when we were together
because I felt it too.

1190
01:19:14.601 --> 01:19:19.300
We tried to fuck and instead,
we wound up making love.

1191
01:19:19.473 --> 01:19:23.034
So if this is what you need to hear in
order to keep you from fucking Lester,

1192
01:19:23.210 --> 01:19:28.648
if this is what you need, then fine.
Here it is, I'm gonna say it.

1193
01:19:29.383 --> 01:19:31.146
I love you, Miri.

1194
01:19:35.422 --> 01:19:36.855
Happy?

1195
01:19:37.691 --> 01:19:38.953
Oh, Jesus.

1196
01:19:39.126 --> 01:19:42.095
You better get a hold of yourself, Zack,
because we just fucked.

1197
01:19:43.797 --> 01:19:45.492
Okay.

1198
01:19:52.106 --> 01:19:54.404
What if I didn't fuck Stacey?

1199
01:19:55.376 --> 01:19:57.003
But you did.

1200
01:19:57.177 --> 01:20:01.045
You know what?
I don't fucking give a shit.

1201
01:20:01.949 --> 01:20:03.576
Wait...

1202
01:20:08.255 --> 01:20:12.055
All right, don't forget I'm down here.
Watch that pullout, huh?

1203
01:20:12.226 --> 01:20:13.989
<i>Yeah.</i>

1204
01:20:14.161 --> 01:20:17.961
This is some damn good coffee.

1205
01:20:18.132 --> 01:20:20.430
- Where you going?
- Getting the fuck out of here.

1206
01:20:20.601 --> 01:20:22.228
We gotta finish this movie.

1207
01:20:28.208 --> 01:20:29.539
Yo!

1208
01:20:33.213 --> 01:20:35.113
You believe this shit?

1209
01:20:35.282 --> 01:20:36.681
Do you believe this shit?

1210
01:20:36.850 --> 01:20:38.545
What the fuck just happened
in there?

1211
01:20:38.719 --> 01:20:40.710
I'll tell you what
just happened in there.

1212
01:20:40.888 --> 01:20:43.550
That chick frosted me
like I was a fucking cake.

1213
01:21:01.642 --> 01:21:03.405
Zack.

1214
01:21:20.294 --> 01:21:22.660
<i>Okay, seriously,
get a picture of me right now.</i>

1215
01:21:23.230 --> 01:21:25.323
I'm hunting humans.

1216
01:21:25.499 --> 01:21:28.491
- Dude, check it out.
- Oh, shit.

1217
01:21:28.669 --> 01:21:30.967
Seriously,
let's shoot the shit out of this bitch.

1218
01:21:31.138 --> 01:21:33.868
- Where you aiming at?
- Cock shots?

1219
01:21:34.041 --> 01:21:35.372
Cock shots.

1220
01:21:49.490 --> 01:21:51.822
We shot you in the balls, cunt nugget.

1221
01:21:52.326 --> 01:21:55.818
Well, it's my job to get shot
in the balls, so... Oh, they're gone.

1222
01:21:55.996 --> 01:21:57.020
<i>Excuse me.</i>

1223
01:21:57.197 --> 01:21:59.572
Didn't you used to work at
the Bean-N-Gone in Monroeville?

1224
01:22:00.801 --> 01:22:04.999
I sure as shit hope this pays better,
I tell you.

1225
01:22:08.709 --> 01:22:11.234
So why don't they just shoot you
with a puck?

1226
01:22:11.411 --> 01:22:12.435
What do you mean?

1227
01:22:12.613 --> 01:22:16.344
I mean, what does paintball
got to do with hockey?

1228
01:22:17.151 --> 01:22:18.812
Nothing, I guess.

1229
01:22:18.986 --> 01:22:21.614
- So ain't no prizes or...?
- No, no.

1230
01:22:21.788 --> 01:22:23.722
So, what are they paying $5 for?

1231
01:22:23.891 --> 01:22:27.019
To shoot a Broad Street Bully
in the balls.

1232
01:22:28.595 --> 01:22:30.495
White people are fucked up.

1233
01:22:31.331 --> 01:22:32.662
Yup, they sure are.

1234
01:22:32.833 --> 01:22:35.768
It's a living. You've been getting
the checks I've been sending?

1235
01:22:35.936 --> 01:22:38.063
Yes, thank you very much.
I appreciate that.

1236
01:22:38.772 --> 01:22:42.833
Probably didn't save you from a
brutal tongue-lashing, though, huh?

1237
01:22:43.010 --> 01:22:46.446
You know, the wife
never found out about the camera,

1238
01:22:46.613 --> 01:22:48.342
because I paid off the bills.

1239
01:22:48.515 --> 01:22:50.039
How did you manage that?

1240
01:22:50.551 --> 01:22:54.317
- Because now I'm Oprah rich.
- No way.

1241
01:22:54.488 --> 01:22:57.616
- The post office fucking settled?
- Hundred-sixty large, son.

1242
01:22:57.791 --> 01:23:01.727
- Nice, man. Congratulations.
- A beautiful day, thank you very much.

1243
01:23:01.895 --> 01:23:03.692
I thought
you made that whole thing up.

1244
01:23:03.864 --> 01:23:05.092
No, no. It was very real.

1245
01:23:05.265 --> 01:23:07.256
You can believe it.

1246
01:23:07.601 --> 01:23:09.967
Even though she's spending all of it.

1247
01:23:15.075 --> 01:23:18.203
Well, since you ain't gonna ask me,
I'll just go ahead and tell you.

1248
01:23:18.378 --> 01:23:22.075
- No, I have not seen Miri.
- I wasn't gonna ask that.

1249
01:23:22.249 --> 01:23:25.309
Oh, I suppose you weren't gonna ask
about your movie, neither?

1250
01:23:25.485 --> 01:23:28.818
Look, that's why I came down here.
I need you to come take a look at it.

1251
01:23:28.989 --> 01:23:31.685
- I'm not interested. Sorry.
- You'd better get interested

1252
01:23:31.858 --> 01:23:34.884
- because you still owe me money.
- What's wrong with the movie?

1253
01:23:35.062 --> 01:23:37.929
The story doesn't make sense.

1254
01:23:38.098 --> 01:23:40.692
- The story?
- The story doesn't make sense.

1255
01:23:40.867 --> 01:23:43.461
It's a fucking porno movie, man.
What story?

1256
01:23:43.637 --> 01:23:46.834
It's a movie, dog,
and a movie's gotta have an ending,

1257
01:23:47.007 --> 01:23:48.599
which we don't have at the moment.

1258
01:23:48.775 --> 01:23:51.642
Come shot, credits.
There's your fucking ending.

1259
01:23:51.812 --> 01:23:53.541
Do me this favor, okay?

1260
01:23:53.714 --> 01:23:56.376
When you're done
getting your nuts blown off,

1261
01:23:56.550 --> 01:24:01.283
come back to humble Monroeville
to my crib for a couple hours,

1262
01:24:01.455 --> 01:24:04.913
check out the flick,
you tell me what's missing.

1263
01:24:05.892 --> 01:24:06.984
No.

1264
01:24:07.261 --> 01:24:10.697
I'll tell you what, you do that,
you don't owe me shit no more.

1265
01:24:10.864 --> 01:24:13.025
- Really?
- Really.

1266
01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:15.430
- Is your wife home?
- Yes.

1267
01:24:16.503 --> 01:24:20.701
- Maybe I should leave the pads on.
- You got some extra ones?

1268
01:24:33.220 --> 01:24:34.278
Hey, honey.

1269
01:24:34.454 --> 01:24:37.116
Where the fuck you been?
And who in the fuck is this now?

1270
01:24:37.557 --> 01:24:39.184
Would you calm down, woman?
Goddamn.

1271
01:24:39.359 --> 01:24:41.827
You already left one white boy
down in my basement

1272
01:24:41.995 --> 01:24:44.862
while you off gallivanting and shit.
What if this motherfucker

1273
01:24:45.032 --> 01:24:48.365
- was all grabby on me?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.

1274
01:24:48.535 --> 01:24:51.402
Oh, what in the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

1275
01:24:51.571 --> 01:24:54.472
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
<i>- White boys love me.</i>

1276
01:24:54.808 --> 01:24:55.832
White boy.

1277
01:24:57.344 --> 01:24:59.369
- I said, white boy.
- Yeah?

1278
01:24:59.546 --> 01:25:00.979
You'd fuck me, wouldn't you?

1279
01:25:01.648 --> 01:25:03.240
- Should I say yes?
- Just say yes.

1280
01:25:03.417 --> 01:25:05.078
Yeah.

1281
01:25:08.221 --> 01:25:11.452
- Why don't you, head downstairs?
- Oh, okay.

1282
01:25:11.625 --> 01:25:13.115
It's just through this hallway.

1283
01:25:13.293 --> 01:25:15.318
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

1284
01:25:17.931 --> 01:25:19.398
What the fuck you looking at?

1285
01:25:19.566 --> 01:25:22.091
Why you gotta be yelling at me
in front of my director?

1286
01:25:22.269 --> 01:25:23.600
- Oh, he's a director?
- Yeah.

1287
01:25:23.770 --> 01:25:25.761
I didn't know that.
Shit, he's a director.

1288
01:25:25.939 --> 01:25:29.841
Well, why don't he direct my ass to a
new husband? How about that shit?

1289
01:25:30.010 --> 01:25:32.410
- That's the bedroom.
<i>- Keep talking, maybe he will.</i>

1290
01:25:32.579 --> 01:25:34.638
Oh, don't nobody
want them saggy-ass balls!

1291
01:25:34.815 --> 01:25:37.875
Saggy balls? Look at these
sagging-ass titties you got around here.

1292
01:25:38.051 --> 01:25:40.679
- You could tie these together.
- Motherfucker, we match.

1293
01:25:44.291 --> 01:25:45.724
Oh, shit.

1294
01:25:46.893 --> 01:25:48.884
Where's my paintball gun at?

1295
01:25:49.062 --> 01:25:51.758
Look at you, editor and DP.
You got your shit covered, man.

1296
01:25:51.932 --> 01:25:56.028
Please, don't ever say "shit-covered"
to me again.

1297
01:25:57.471 --> 01:26:01.237
Roll the film for the man, please,
so we can see what he thinks.

1298
01:26:01.408 --> 01:26:04.571
Just jump through it. I ain't
got all night. The bitch is on me.

1299
01:26:05.946 --> 01:26:08.779
"Nigga Rich Productions." Classy.

1300
01:26:08.949 --> 01:26:11.417
- Yeah, DreamWorks was taken.
- Was it?

1301
01:26:11.585 --> 01:26:14.247
Plus, it sounds like an underground
gay fuck club.

1302
01:26:14.421 --> 01:26:16.116
"I met a guy at DreamWorks." Yeah.

1303
01:26:16.289 --> 01:26:20.692
All right, so we got
Lester and Stacey fucking.

1304
01:26:20.861 --> 01:26:22.624
Then we got
Barry and Bubbles fucking.

1305
01:26:23.997 --> 01:26:26.261
And then this boring bullshit.

1306
01:26:31.338 --> 01:26:34.739
Okay, just, go to the next scene,
would you?

1307
01:26:37.310 --> 01:26:40.473
- What next scene?
- The one with Miri and Lester?

1308
01:26:40.647 --> 01:26:42.581
We never shot it.

1309
01:26:43.216 --> 01:26:45.684
- Why not?
- Because after you left that night,

1310
01:26:45.852 --> 01:26:48.787
Miri came out of the backroom
and said she couldn't do it.

1311
01:26:48.955 --> 01:26:52.948
- We wrapped after that.
- Wrapped? So...

1312
01:26:54.327 --> 01:26:57.353
- Wait, so Miri...
- Never fucked nobody.

1313
01:26:57.531 --> 01:26:58.623
Just you.

1314
01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:03.897
Now, I wonder why she did that.

1315
01:27:07.541 --> 01:27:11.978
You see, there was a time when I was
just a bitter old fuck making coffees,

1316
01:27:12.145 --> 01:27:14.113
and Stacey was just a lap dancer

1317
01:27:14.281 --> 01:27:16.272
and Barry and Bubbles
didn't know each other

1318
01:27:16.450 --> 01:27:19.749
and this fool here,
hell, I don't even know what he was.

1319
01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:22.980
- A white supremacist.
- Man, fuck you.

1320
01:27:23.156 --> 01:27:24.987
Then two people come along

1321
01:27:25.158 --> 01:27:28.355
and showed us something
we didn't know existed.

1322
01:27:28.528 --> 01:27:33.522
A world of possibilities
where plain old people just like us

1323
01:27:33.700 --> 01:27:35.964
could do something special.

1324
01:27:36.136 --> 01:27:39.867
Even if it's something as simple
as filming people fucking.

1325
01:27:50.717 --> 01:27:54.016
Sometimes we just need someone

1326
01:27:54.187 --> 01:27:58.180
to show us something
we can't see for ourselves

1327
01:28:00.827 --> 01:28:03.227
and then we're changed forever.

1328
01:28:14.441 --> 01:28:17.706
So as you can see,
our movie ain't got no ending.

1329
01:28:19.279 --> 01:28:21.338
Every movie needs an ending,
don't it?

1330
01:28:26.052 --> 01:28:27.076
Peace.

1331
01:28:29.589 --> 01:28:33.355
Delaney,
you're a slick cupid motherfucker.

1332
01:28:33.793 --> 01:28:35.693
Ain't love grand?

1333
01:28:35.862 --> 01:28:38.888
<i>Why the fuck is this white boy
running through my goddamn house?</i>

1334
01:28:40.267 --> 01:28:41.962
Sometimes.

1335
01:28:54.948 --> 01:28:56.575
Miri.

1336
01:28:57.284 --> 01:28:59.718
- Miri.
<i>- Zack?</i>

1337
01:29:00.887 --> 01:29:02.320
<i>- Miri. I'm sorry.
- Get out.</i>

1338
01:29:02.489 --> 01:29:04.013
- Close the door.
- It was closed.

1339
01:29:04.190 --> 01:29:07.387
- It was closed over...
- Just close the fucking door, Zack.

1340
01:29:07.561 --> 01:29:12.225
I never slept with Stacey that night,
okay? I swear to God.

1341
01:29:12.399 --> 01:29:14.526
When we got into my room,
you know what we did?

1342
01:29:14.701 --> 01:29:19.263
We talked about you, and us
and how things were different

1343
01:29:19.439 --> 01:29:22.431
and how I was
too much of a fucking pussy

1344
01:29:22.609 --> 01:29:25.169
to just tell you how I felt about you.

1345
01:29:25.912 --> 01:29:30.281
And I know... I know that that's only
because of all the stupid shit we said

1346
01:29:30.450 --> 01:29:35.752
about how we wouldn't let sex
change us, but it did. It changed me.

1347
01:29:36.523 --> 01:29:38.991
That has to be love, right?

1348
01:29:39.292 --> 01:29:41.590
It has to be love

1349
01:29:42.095 --> 01:29:46.191
and just so you know, I can't go back
to being just friends anymore,

1350
01:29:47.567 --> 01:29:49.364
- because I just can't.
- Good.

1351
01:29:49.536 --> 01:29:51.504
And I think...

1352
01:29:52.839 --> 01:29:54.466
I think that you feel the same way.

1353
01:29:55.308 --> 01:30:00.245
Because that night after I left,
you didn't fuck Lester.

1354
01:30:03.717 --> 01:30:05.548
What's up, Zack?

1355
01:30:15.962 --> 01:30:16.986
You know what?

1356
01:30:17.163 --> 01:30:19.859
I don't care that you're fucking
Lester, okay? How's that?

1357
01:30:20.033 --> 01:30:22.729
- Oh, shit.
- I don't wanna be with anyone but you.

1358
01:30:22.902 --> 01:30:27.703
So I will wait forever for you, okay?
I will wait the rest of my life

1359
01:30:27.874 --> 01:30:31.173
because I love you, and I have
for as long as I can remember.

1360
01:30:31.811 --> 01:30:35.042
And I would rather die
than be without you, Miriam Linky.

1361
01:30:35.215 --> 01:30:36.842
Miri's last name is Linky?

1362
01:30:37.684 --> 01:30:40.244
You're gonna fuck a guy
who doesn't know your last name?

1363
01:30:40.420 --> 01:30:43.287
Or that you beat up Carl Roth
in the sixth grade? I know that.

1364
01:30:43.456 --> 01:30:46.357
Or what your senior prom dress
would've looked like had we gone

1365
01:30:46.526 --> 01:30:49.427
but we decided not to,
and we got drunk alone instead.

1366
01:30:49.596 --> 01:30:51.587
Or that you washed your hair
in the toilet.

1367
01:30:51.765 --> 01:30:52.925
We're not fucking, Zack.

1368
01:30:53.099 --> 01:30:55.033
Or that you're not fucking Zack...
What?

1369
01:30:55.201 --> 01:30:57.260
I asked her to fuck me.
She wouldn't do it.

1370
01:30:57.437 --> 01:31:00.463
I even tried to talk her into giving me
the fucking Dutch rudder.

1371
01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:02.335
Shot me down on that too.

1372
01:31:03.443 --> 01:31:06.435
- And a Dutch rudder is?
- Don't know what a Dutch rudder...?

1373
01:31:06.613 --> 01:31:08.137
All right, you grab your dick,

1374
01:31:08.314 --> 01:31:10.339
then you have someone else
work your arm.

1375
01:31:10.517 --> 01:31:11.779
Here, let me show you.

1376
01:31:11.951 --> 01:31:15.148
All right, grab my arm. I'm grabbing
my dick, you're grabbing my arm.

1377
01:31:15.321 --> 01:31:18.449
Now work it. Work my arm.
See that shit? Work it up and down.

1378
01:31:18.625 --> 01:31:20.684
It's like someone else
is jerking you off.

1379
01:31:20.860 --> 01:31:21.884
Okay.

1380
01:31:22.062 --> 01:31:23.689
There's the double Dutch rudder,

1381
01:31:23.863 --> 01:31:26.161
which, I grab my dick,
you grab your dick,

1382
01:31:26.332 --> 01:31:28.892
you work my arm, I work your arm,
same time.

1383
01:31:29.069 --> 01:31:31.435
It's like jerking off together
but not gay.

1384
01:31:31.604 --> 01:31:34.095
We're not touching dicks,
each other's dicks anyway.

1385
01:31:34.274 --> 01:31:37.209
I'm touching my own dick.
You're working it, and I'm loving it.

1386
01:31:37.377 --> 01:31:40.278
It feels good, sir. Try me, come on.

1387
01:31:40.447 --> 01:31:43.041
Sorry to change the subject on you,
Lester,

1388
01:31:43.216 --> 01:31:48.882
but if you're not fucking Miri,
why is your dick out right now?

1389
01:31:49.055 --> 01:31:52.081
Because I live here now,
and I like to be naked.

1390
01:31:52.692 --> 01:31:54.182
- What?
- When you moved out,

1391
01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:57.761
she couldn't afford to pay her rent
by herself, so I moved in to help.

1392
01:31:58.131 --> 01:31:59.996
But you just came out of her room.

1393
01:32:00.166 --> 01:32:02.327
That's my room now.
She moved in your old room.

1394
01:32:02.502 --> 01:32:05.164
Wait, wait, wait. She changed rooms?

1395
01:32:05.338 --> 01:32:09.001
Yeah, she said she did it because she
missed the smell of you or some shit.

1396
01:32:11.344 --> 01:32:13.107
I don't smell anything.

1397
01:32:13.279 --> 01:32:16.180
But you know what?
That probably means she loves you.

1398
01:32:18.051 --> 01:32:21.077
- Night, Zack.
- Night.

1399
01:32:25.358 --> 01:32:26.484
Do you?

1400
01:32:29.429 --> 01:32:30.623
Then why are you crying?

1401
01:32:31.464 --> 01:32:33.932
Because I missed you so much.

1402
01:32:34.701 --> 01:32:36.362
<i>Me too.</i>

1403
01:32:37.637 --> 01:32:39.662
I love you.

1404
01:32:43.777 --> 01:32:45.540
- I love you, I love you.
<i>- I love you.</i>

1405
01:32:45.712 --> 01:32:47.236
I don't mean to alarm you

1406
01:32:47.413 --> 01:32:49.881
but I think I just jerked off Lester
a little bit.

1407
01:32:50.984 --> 01:32:53.316
- The Dutch rudder?
- Yeah, it's ingenious, right?

1408
01:32:53.486 --> 01:32:56.853
If you ask me nicely, I will
Dutch-rudder you the rest of our lives.

1409
01:32:57.023 --> 01:33:00.390
Good. I'm getting tired
of fucking the Fleshlight.

1410
01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:01.959
- You fucked it?
- Yeah.

1411
01:33:02.128 --> 01:33:04.653
- What'd it feel like?
- Like fucking a flashlight.

1412
01:33:05.231 --> 01:33:09.190
<i>- Wrong room.</i>
- Oh, God. That's gross.

1413
01:33:10.436 --> 01:33:13.064
Let us fuck.

1414
01:36:12.752 --> 01:36:15.243
Hello.
Welcome to Nigga Rich Productions,

1415
01:36:15.421 --> 01:36:18.322
home of
Zack and Miri Make Your Porno,

1416
01:36:18.491 --> 01:36:20.220
the production house for the couple

1417
01:36:20.393 --> 01:36:23.021
looking to put a little spice
in their sex life.

1418
01:36:23.196 --> 01:36:26.654
- Shall we take a look around?
- Fuck me so hard. Oh, God.

1419
01:36:26.833 --> 01:36:30.769
First, you'll meet for a consultation
with one of our romance-ologists,

1420
01:36:30.937 --> 01:36:33.462
who'll coach you
through that initial awkward stage

1421
01:36:33.639 --> 01:36:35.163
before you're camera-ready.

1422
01:36:35.341 --> 01:36:39.869
So we will start off
with some erotic massage and some...

1423
01:36:40.046 --> 01:36:43.015
Dude. Some light petting.

1424
01:36:43.182 --> 01:36:44.706
That sounds good.

1425
01:36:44.884 --> 01:36:48.786
Are you guys sure you don't wanna do
some, butt-sack work too?

1426
01:36:48.955 --> 01:36:51.016
- Let's move on, shall we?
- Why?

1427
01:36:51.190 --> 01:36:53.488
<i>From their break-out hit,</i>
Swallow My Cockuccino,

1428
01:36:53.659 --> 01:36:56.093
<i>to the multi-million selling</i>
Swallow My Cockuccino II

1429
01:36:56.262 --> 01:36:58.355
<i>and the award-winning</i>
Star Whores <i>saga,</i>

1430
01:36:58.531 --> 01:37:01.500
<i>including</i> Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter,

1431
01:37:01.667 --> 01:37:03.498
<i>Zack and Miri have proven
time and again</i>

1432
01:37:03.669 --> 01:37:06.399
<i>that they know
how to shoot hot sex.</i>

1433
01:37:07.373 --> 01:37:14.074
As an actor, I've sometimes brought
my work home with me inappropriately.

1434
01:37:14.247 --> 01:37:18.684
When you're telling your real-life lover
in the bedroom,

1435
01:37:18.851 --> 01:37:21.411
to, you know, bend over
while you cake your hand in K-Y,

1436
01:37:21.587 --> 01:37:24.078
it is a sign that the romance is dead,
I think.

1437
01:37:24.257 --> 01:37:27.749
Then we turned to the professionals
at Zack and Miri Make Your Porno.

1438
01:37:27.927 --> 01:37:31.055
Oh, my God,
they totally saved our civil union.

1439
01:37:31.230 --> 01:37:33.664
They filmed what was inside of us

1440
01:37:33.833 --> 01:37:36.427
and not what was coming out of us
necessarily.

1441
01:37:36.602 --> 01:37:39.002
It helped me see his asshole

1442
01:37:39.172 --> 01:37:43.905
as not just a come dumpster,

1443
01:37:44.077 --> 01:37:47.513
but a sign of his beauty, his flower.

1444
01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:51.377
It became a, gorgeous orchid.

1445
01:37:51.551 --> 01:37:55.715
Orchids grow
in sort of the filthiest conditions.

1446
01:37:55.888 --> 01:38:02.487
That's what his asshole became to me.
This beautiful flower amidst shit.

1447
01:38:02.662 --> 01:38:05.222
- Honey, they get the metaphor.
- I don't think they do.

1448
01:38:05.398 --> 01:38:08.162
Let's just say,
thank you to Zack and Miri.

1449
01:38:08.334 --> 01:38:10.928
It's helped us out,
it's helped our friends.

1450
01:38:11.104 --> 01:38:13.265
Enrique? Park?

1451
01:38:13.439 --> 01:38:16.499
Park? Enrique?

1452
01:38:16.742 --> 01:38:20.041
Can we get a little love
for Zack and Miri?

1453
01:38:21.214 --> 01:38:24.809
They don't even know what's going on,
they're so pilled up.

1454
01:38:25.451 --> 01:38:29.387
But don't take his word for it.
Just ask our co-founders.

1455
01:38:30.123 --> 01:38:33.286
- Hi. I'm Miri Linky Brown.
- I'm Zack Linky Brown.

1456

digital video.

A forever keepsake of your passion.

1460
01:38:44.170 --> 01:38:47.139
That's right, Miri. Why set up a camera
at the end of your bed

1461
01:38:47.306 --> 01:38:49.968
and settle for one unflattering angle,

1462
01:38:50.143 --> 01:38:53.340
when you could let the professionals
dazzle and delight your senses

1463
01:38:53.513 --> 01:38:56.277
with an array of shots
so masterfully rendered

1464
01:38:56.449 --> 01:38:58.849
you'll swear
Martin Scorsese snuck into your room

1465
01:38:59.018 --> 01:39:00.713
and caught you fucking?

1466
01:39:00.887 --> 01:39:03.117
