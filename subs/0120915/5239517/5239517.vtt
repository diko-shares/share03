1
00:02:01.104 --> 00:02:02.931
- Captain.
- Yes, sir?

2
00:02:03.415 --> 00:02:05.341
Tell them we wish to board at once.

3
00:02:06.765 --> 00:02:08.165
With all due respect...

4
00:02:08.226 --> 00:02:11.506
...the ambassadors for the supreme chancellor
wish to board immediately.

5
00:02:11.715 --> 00:02:13.494
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

6
00:02:13.595 --> 00:02:16.895
<i>As you know,
our blockade is perfectly legal...</i>

7
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.790
<i>...and we'd be happy to
receive the ambassadors.</i>

8
00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:46.012
I'm TC-14 at your service.

9
00:02:46.193 --> 00:02:48.093
This way, please.

10
00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:57.295
We are greatly honored
by your visit, Ambassadors.

11
00:02:57.366 --> 00:02:59.166
Make yourselves comfortable.

12
00:02:59.254 --> 00:03:01.890
My master will be with you shortly.

13
00:03:05.635 --> 00:03:07.764
I have a bad feeling about this.

14
00:03:08.015 --> 00:03:09.715
I don't sense anything.

15
00:03:09.814 --> 00:03:15.061
It's not about the mission, Master.
It's something elsewhere, elusive.

16
00:03:15.181 --> 00:03:17.570
Don't center on your anxieties, Obi-Wan.

17
00:03:17.601 --> 00:03:20.801
Keep your concentration here and now,
where it belongs.

18
00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:23.912
But Master Yoda said
I should be mindful of the future.

19
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.940
But not at the expense of the moment.

20
00:03:25.991 --> 00:03:28.891
Be mindful of the living
Force, young Padawan.

21
00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.927
Yes, Master.

22
00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.913
How do you think this trade viceroy
will deal with the chancellor's demands?

23
00:03:37.063 --> 00:03:39.126
These Federation types are cowards.

24
00:03:39.217 --> 00:03:41.717
The negotiations will be short.

25
00:03:42.907 --> 00:03:45.243
What? What did you say?

26
00:03:45.647 --> 00:03:48.516
The ambassadors are Jedi
knights, I believe.

27
00:03:49.278 --> 00:03:50.591
I knew it.

28
00:03:50.692 --> 00:03:52.792
They're here to force a settlement.

29
00:03:54.042 --> 00:03:57.195
Distract them.
I will contact Lord Sidious.

30
00:03:57.474 --> 00:03:58.950
Are you brain-dead?

31
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.746
I'm not going in there with two Jedi.

32
00:04:03.901 --> 00:04:05.278
Send a droid.

33
00:04:10.058 --> 00:04:12.018
Is it in their nature
to make us wait this long?

34
00:04:12.127 --> 00:04:17.423
No. I sense an unusual amount of fear
for something as trivial as this trade dispute.

35
00:04:28.218 --> 00:04:29.797
<i>What is it?</i>

36
00:04:29.898 --> 00:04:32.598
This scheme of yours has
failed, Lord Sidious.

37
00:04:32.891 --> 00:04:36.295
The blockade is finished.
We dare not go against these Jedi.

38
00:04:36.467 --> 00:04:41.681
<i>Viceroy, I don't want
this stunted slime in my sight again.</i>

39
00:04:42.627 --> 00:04:44.973
<i>This turn of events is unfortunate.</i>

40
00:04:45.195 --> 00:04:49.322
<i>We must accelerate our plans.
Begin landing your troops.</i>

41
00:04:49.781 --> 00:04:53.251
My lord, is that legal?

42
00:04:53.458 --> 00:04:56.010
<i>I will make it legal.</i>

43
00:04:56.371 --> 00:04:58.014
And the Jedi?

44
00:04:58.239 --> 00:05:02.852
<i>The chancellor should never have
brought them into this. Kill them immediately.</i>

45
00:05:03.361 --> 00:05:06.831
Yes. Yes, my lord.
As you wish.

46
00:05:09.359 --> 00:05:10.743
Captain, look!

47
00:05:11.894 --> 00:05:13.294
Shields up!

48
00:05:20.815 --> 00:05:22.192
Dioxis.

49
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.535
<i>They must be dead by now.</i>

50
00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.000
<i>Destroy what's left of them.</i>

51
00:05:40.647 --> 00:05:42.774
Oh... excuse me.

52
00:05:42.956 --> 00:05:45.809
- Check it out, Corporal. We'll cover you.
- Roger, roger.

53
00:05:47.956 --> 00:05:49.265
Blast them.

54
00:05:54.357 --> 00:05:55.944
What is going on down there?

55
00:05:56.305 --> 00:05:58.005
We lost the transmission, sir.

56
00:06:02.565 --> 00:06:05.545
Have you ever encountered
a Jedi knight before, sir?

57
00:06:05.616 --> 00:06:08.616
Well, no, but I don't...
Seal off the bridge.

58
00:06:08.707 --> 00:06:11.119
- Yes, sir.
- That won't be enough, sir.

59
00:06:11.239 --> 00:06:13.416
I want droidekas up here at once!

60
00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.075
We will not survive this.

61
00:06:27.829 --> 00:06:30.181
Close the blast doors!

62
00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.907
That will hold them.

63
00:06:46.501 --> 00:06:49.070
They are still coming through.

64
00:06:49.709 --> 00:06:51.202
This is impossible!

65
00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:58.793
Where are those droidekas?

66
00:07:00.106 --> 00:07:01.866
Master! Destroyers!

67
00:07:08.236 --> 00:07:10.438
They have shield generators!

68
00:07:11.281 --> 00:07:13.482
It's a standoff. Let's go.

69
00:07:18.054 --> 00:07:20.573
They're no match for droidekas.

70
00:07:20.891 --> 00:07:22.191
<i>Sir!</i>

71
00:07:22.842 --> 00:07:25.053
They've gone up the ventilation shaft.

72
00:07:33.985 --> 00:07:37.122
- Battle droids.
- It's an invasion army.

73
00:07:38.549 --> 00:07:41.085
This is an odd play for
the Trade Federation.

74
00:07:41.452 --> 00:07:44.205
We've got to warn the Naboo
and contact Chancellor Valorum.

75
00:07:44.415 --> 00:07:45.676
<i>Let's split up.</i>

76
00:07:45.783 --> 00:07:49.060
<i>Stow aboard separate ships
and meet down on the planet.</i>

77
00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.013
You were right about one thing, Master.

78
00:07:53.081 --> 00:07:55.734
The negotiations were short.

79
00:07:56.881 --> 00:07:59.268
Sir, a transmission from the planet.

80
00:07:59.599 --> 00:08:01.599
It's Queen Amidala herself.

81
00:08:01.665 --> 00:08:05.268
At last we are getting results.

82
00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:08.488
Again you come before us,
Your Highness.

83
00:08:08.697 --> 00:08:11.666
<i>You will not be so pleased when you hear
what I have to say, Viceroy.</i>

84
00:08:11.807 --> 00:08:15.493
<i>Your trade boycott of our planet has ended.</i>

85
00:08:15.704 --> 00:08:18.157
I was not aware of such failure.

86
00:08:18.258 --> 00:08:21.058
<i>I have word that the chancellor's
ambassadors are with you now...</i>

87
00:08:21.158 --> 00:08:23.811
<i>...and that you have been commanded
to reach settlement.</i>

88
00:08:23.911 --> 00:08:26.547
<i>I know nothing of any ambassadors.</i>

89
00:08:26.965 --> 00:08:28.691
You must be mistaken.

90
00:08:29.092 --> 00:08:30.938
<i>Beware, Viceroy.</i>

91
00:08:31.033 --> 00:08:33.633
<i>The Federation has gone
too far this time.</i>

92
00:08:34.055 --> 00:08:37.692
We would never do anything
without the approval of the senate.

93
00:08:38.476 --> 00:08:40.497
You assume too much.

94
00:08:40.698 --> 00:08:42.598
<i>We will see.</i>

95
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:47.645
- She's right. The senate will never...
- It's too late now.

96
00:08:47.694 --> 00:08:50.730
- Do you think she suspects an attack?
- I don't know.

97
00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:55.049
But we must move quickly to disrupt
all communications down there.

98
00:09:00.632 --> 00:09:04.644
<i>Negotiations haven't started
because the ambassadors aren't there?</i>

99
00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:06.665
<i>How could that be true?</i>

100
00:09:06.873 --> 00:09:11.092
<i>I have assurances from the chancellor
his ambassadors did arrive.</i>

101
00:09:15.932 --> 00:09:17.852
Senator Palpatine.

102
00:09:18.183 --> 00:09:19.783
What's happening?

103
00:09:20.508 --> 00:09:22.268
Check the transmission generator.

104
00:09:22.515 --> 00:09:26.878
<i>A communications disruption
can mean only one thing: invasion.</i>

105
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.247
The Federation would not dare go that far.

106
00:09:29.419 --> 00:09:33.448
The senate would revoke their trade
franchise, and they'd be finished.

107
00:09:33.549 --> 00:09:36.168
We must continue to rely on negotiation.

108
00:09:36.277 --> 00:09:39.456
Negotiation?
We've lost all communications.

109
00:09:39.807 --> 00:09:42.207
And where are the chancellor's ambassadors?

110
00:09:43.658 --> 00:09:45.902
This is a dangerous
situation, Your Highness.

111
00:09:46.089 --> 00:09:50.718
Our security volunteers will be no match
against a battle-hardened Federation army.

112
00:09:51.816 --> 00:09:55.979
I will not condone a course of action
that will lead us to war.

113
00:10:31.898 --> 00:10:33.374
<i>Yes, Viceroy?</i>

114
00:10:33.425 --> 00:10:37.412
<i>Captain, we've searched the ship
and there is no trace of the Jedi.</i>

115
00:10:37.695 --> 00:10:40.131
<i>They may have gotten on
one of your landing craft.</i>

116
00:10:40.231 --> 00:10:42.709
If they're down here, sir, we'll find them.

117
00:10:42.934 --> 00:10:47.363
<i>Use caution.
These Jedi are not to be underestimated.</i>

118
00:11:01.761 --> 00:11:03.279
Get away!
Get out of here!

119
00:11:15.727 --> 00:11:17.137
Was'n dat?

120
00:11:17.594 --> 00:11:18.887
Hey, wait!

121
00:11:19.454 --> 00:11:21.166
Oh, mooie-mooie, I love you.

122
00:11:21.267 --> 00:11:23.467
You almost got us killed.
Are you brainless?

123
00:11:23.725 --> 00:11:25.112
I spake.

124
00:11:25.213 --> 00:11:27.313
The ability to speak
does not make you intelligent.

125
00:11:27.562 --> 00:11:30.482
- Now, get out of here.
- No, no, mesa stay.

126
00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.669
Mesa culled Jar Jar Binks.
Mesa your humble servant.

127
00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:35.770
- That won't be necessary.
- Oh, but it 'tis.

128
00:11:35.859 --> 00:11:38.713
'Tis demanded by the gods, it 'tis.

129
00:11:40.105 --> 00:11:41.572
Stay down!

130
00:11:49.225 --> 00:11:51.062
You saved my again.

131
00:11:51.113 --> 00:11:53.013
- What's this?
- A local.

132
00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:55.732
Let's get out of here
before more droids show up.

133
00:11:55.876 --> 00:11:58.970
More?
"More" did you spake?

134
00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:04.335
Ex-squeeze-me, but de mostest
safest place would be Gunga City.

135
00:12:04.516 --> 00:12:08.161
Is where I grew up. 'Tis a hidden city.

136
00:12:09.287 --> 00:12:10.688
A city?

137
00:12:11.064 --> 00:12:13.074
Can you take us there?

138
00:12:13.483 --> 00:12:15.112
On second thought, no.

139
00:12:15.213 --> 00:12:17.813
- Not really, no.
- No?

140
00:12:18.004 --> 00:12:20.010
'Tis embarrassing...

141
00:12:20.111 --> 00:12:24.011
...but my afraid my've been banished.

142
00:12:24.294 --> 00:12:27.390
My forgotten. Da bosses
would do terrible tings to me.

143
00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:30.350
Terrible tings to me if me goen back dare.

144
00:12:31.367 --> 00:12:33.127
You hear that?

145
00:12:33.962 --> 00:12:37.632
That is the sound of a thousand
terrible things heading this way.

146
00:12:37.882 --> 00:12:40.210
If they find us, they will crush us...

147
00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:44.823
...grind us into tiny pieces
and blast us into oblivion.

148
00:12:46.784 --> 00:12:48.945
Yousa point is well seen.

149
00:12:49.452 --> 00:12:51.395
Dis way. Hurry!

150
00:12:56.726 --> 00:12:59.963
- How much further?
- Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?

151
00:13:00.173 --> 00:13:01.569
Ah, my warning you.

152
00:13:01.667 --> 00:13:06.331
Gungans no liken outsiders,
so don't spect a warm welcome.

153
00:13:06.482 --> 00:13:09.782
Don't worry. This hasn't been
our day for warm welcomes.

154
00:13:20.833 --> 00:13:22.744
Yousa follow me now, okeyday?

155
00:14:07.846 --> 00:14:10.632
So good bein home!

156
00:14:27.303 --> 00:14:28.254
Hey, yousa.

157
00:14:28.309 --> 00:14:29.661
Stopa dare.

158
00:14:30.045 --> 00:14:32.598
Heyo-dales, Cap'n Tarpals.

159
00:14:32.813 --> 00:14:34.113
Mesa back.

160
00:14:34.397 --> 00:14:37.350
Noah gain, Jar Jar.
Yousa goen tada bosses.

161
00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:39.913
Yousa in big dudu dis time.

162
00:14:45.815 --> 00:14:47.659
How wude.

163
00:14:56.074 --> 00:14:58.543
Yousa cannot bees hair.

164
00:14:58.732 --> 00:15:02.961
Dis army of Mackineeks
up dare is new weesong.

165
00:15:03.369 --> 00:15:08.189
A droid army is about to attack
the Naboo. We must warn them.

166
00:15:08.298 --> 00:15:11.060
Wesa no like da Naboo.

167
00:15:12.045 --> 00:15:14.589
<i>Da Naboo tink day so smarty.</i>

168
00:15:14.789 --> 00:15:17.642
Day tink day brains so big.

169
00:15:18.084 --> 00:15:22.171
Once those droids take control of the
surface, they will take control of you.

170
00:15:22.322 --> 00:15:24.422
Mesa no tink so.

171
00:15:24.599 --> 00:15:27.411
Day not know of uss-en.

172
00:15:28.044 --> 00:15:30.550
You and the Naboo
form a symbiont circle.

173
00:15:30.651 --> 00:15:34.151
What happens to one of you will affect
the other. You must understand this.

174
00:15:34.459 --> 00:15:38.996
Wesa no carrrre-nn about da Naboo.

175
00:15:39.356 --> 00:15:41.499
Then speed us on our way.

176
00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:44.269
Wesa ganna speed yous away.

177
00:15:44.699 --> 00:15:47.176
We could use a transport.

178
00:15:47.337 --> 00:15:50.206
Wesa give yousa una bongo.

179
00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:53.369
Da speediest way tooda Naboo...

180
00:15:53.441 --> 00:15:55.101
...'tis goen through...

181
00:15:55.361 --> 00:15:58.197
...the planet core.

182
00:15:58.641 --> 00:16:00.201
Now...

183
00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:02.020
...go.

184
00:16:02.128 --> 00:16:04.555
Thank you for your help.
We leave in peace.

185
00:16:05.206 --> 00:16:06.610
Master, what's a bongo?

186
00:16:06.741 --> 00:16:08.741
A transport, I hope.

187
00:16:09.027 --> 00:16:10.837
Deysa setten yousa up.

188
00:16:11.146 --> 00:16:15.141
Goen through da planet core?
Bad bombin'.

189
00:16:16.276 --> 00:16:18.853
Any help here would be hot.

190
00:16:20.604 --> 00:16:22.640
Master, we're short on time.

191
00:16:23.341 --> 00:16:26.010
We'll need a navigator to get us
through the planet's core.

192
00:16:26.302 --> 00:16:28.262
This Gungan may be of help.

193
00:16:30.275 --> 00:16:33.361
What is to become of Jar Jar Binks here?

194
00:16:33.702 --> 00:16:37.322
Hisen to be pune-ished.

195
00:16:39.131 --> 00:16:40.558
<i>I saved his life.</i>

196
00:16:40.683 --> 00:16:43.419
He owes me what you call a "life-debt."

197
00:16:43.769 --> 00:16:47.281
Your gods demand
that his life belongs to me now.

198
00:16:47.474 --> 00:16:49.425
Binks...

199
00:16:49.851 --> 00:16:53.995
...yousa havena liveplay
with thisen hisen?

200
00:17:00.695 --> 00:17:02.572
Begone wit him!

201
00:17:05.405 --> 00:17:07.368
Count me outta dis one.

202
00:17:07.439 --> 00:17:10.539
Better dead here than dead in da core.

203
00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:14.003
Yee gods! What mesa sayin?

204
00:17:32.146 --> 00:17:34.966
Dis is nutsen. Oh, gooberfish!

205
00:17:35.085 --> 00:17:38.288
- Why were you banished, Jar Jar?
- It's a longo tale-o, buta...

206
00:17:38.426 --> 00:17:43.539
...a small part of it
would be mesa... clumsy.

207
00:17:43.638 --> 00:17:48.368
- You were banished for being clumsy?
- Yousa might'n be sayin dat.

208
00:18:01.397 --> 00:18:05.977
Mesa caused mabee one two-y
lettle bitty axadentes, huh?

209
00:18:05.769 --> 00:18:07.798
Yud-say boom da gasser...

210
00:18:07.899 --> 00:18:10.899
...den crashin der boss's heyblibber,

211
00:18:17.922 --> 00:18:20.183
Big gooberfish!
Huge-o teeth!

212
00:18:31.019 --> 00:18:33.062
There's always a bigger fish.

213
00:18:33.283 --> 00:18:35.142
Mesa tink we goen back now.

214
00:18:46.426 --> 00:18:49.746
The invasion is on schedule, my lord.

215
00:18:49.796 --> 00:18:52.415
<i>I have the senate bogged
down in procedures.</i>

216
00:18:52.595 --> 00:18:57.091
<i>They will have no choice but
to accept your control of the system.</i>

217
00:18:57.245 --> 00:19:01.691
The queen has great faith
that the senate will side with her.

218
00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:04.949
<i>Queen Amidala is young and naive.</i>

219
00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:08.503
<i>You will find controlling her
will not be difficult.</i>

220
00:19:08.736 --> 00:19:10.430
Yes, my lord.

221
00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:15.050
You didn't tell him
about the missing Jedi.

222
00:19:15.198 --> 00:19:19.468
No need to report that to him
until we have something to report.

223
00:19:24.062 --> 00:19:27.732
- Where wesa goin?
- Don't worry. The Force will guide us.

224
00:19:27.902 --> 00:19:30.972
Oh, maxi big, da Force.

225
00:19:31.579 --> 00:19:33.640
Well, dat smells stinkowiff.

226
00:19:34.966 --> 00:19:37.459
- We're losing power.
- Oh, no!

227
00:19:43.199 --> 00:19:45.470
Wesa dyin' here.

228
00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:48.397
- Just relax. We're not in trouble yet.
- What "yet"?

229
00:19:48.697 --> 00:19:51.518
<i>Monsters out dare. Leak'n in here.</i>

230
00:19:51.598 --> 00:19:56.817
All sink'n and no power?
Whena yousa tinkin wesa in trouble?

231
00:19:58.004 --> 00:19:59.831
Power's back.

232
00:20:00.325 --> 00:20:02.001
Monster's back!

233
00:20:10.319 --> 00:20:11.973
Relax.

234
00:20:12.414 --> 00:20:13.614
You overdid it.

235
00:20:30.188 --> 00:20:32.190
Head for that outcropping.

236
00:21:09.894 --> 00:21:11.871
Viceroy, we have captured the queen.

237
00:21:13.268 --> 00:21:14.744
Victory.

238
00:21:28.051 --> 00:21:29.711
Dis'n loverly.

239
00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:38.753
How will you explain this invasion
to the senate?

240
00:21:38.932 --> 00:21:43.177
The queen and I will sign a treaty
that will legitimize our occupation here.

241
00:21:43.386 --> 00:21:46.316
I have assurances
it will be ratified by the senate.

242
00:21:46.507 --> 00:21:49.907
- I will not cooperate.
- Now, now, Your Highness.

243
00:21:50.104 --> 00:21:54.526
In time, your people's suffering
will persuade you to see our point of view.

244
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:57.400
- Commander.
- Yes, sir.

245
00:21:57.609 --> 00:21:59.252
Process them.

246
00:21:59.361 --> 00:22:01.098
Captain, take them to Camp 4.

247
00:22:01.181 --> 00:22:02.981
Roger, roger.

248
00:22:58.122 --> 00:23:00.409
We should leave the street,
Your Highness.

249
00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:02.040
Get their weapons.

250
00:23:02.632 --> 00:23:05.335
Oh! Yousa guys bombad!

251
00:23:07.685 --> 00:23:09.631
We're ambassadors for
the supreme chancellor.

252
00:23:09.759 --> 00:23:11.859
Your negotiations seemed
to have failed, Ambassador.

253
00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:13.833
The negotiations never took place.

254
00:23:14.002 --> 00:23:16.202
<i>It's urgent that we make contact
with the Republic.</i>

255
00:23:16.321 --> 00:23:18.481
They've knocked out
all our communications.

256
00:23:18.641 --> 00:23:22.095
- Do you have transports?
- In the main hangar. This way.

257
00:23:27.182 --> 00:23:29.918
- There are too many of them.
- That won't be a problem.

258
00:23:30.118 --> 00:23:33.788
Your Highness, under the circumstances,
I suggest you come to Coruscant with us.

259
00:23:33.877 --> 00:23:36.796
Thank you, Ambassador,
but my place is with my people.

260
00:23:36.925 --> 00:23:39.677
- They will kill you if you stay.
- They wouldn't dare.

261
00:23:39.836 --> 00:23:42.156
They need her to sign a treaty
to make this invasion legal.

262
00:23:42.301 --> 00:23:43.501
They can't afford to kill her.

263
00:23:43.576 --> 00:23:45.705
There is something else behind all this,
Your Highness.

264
00:23:45.736 --> 00:23:47.836
There's no logic
in the Federation's move here.

265
00:23:47.914 --> 00:23:49.907
My feelings tell me they will destroy you.

266
00:23:50.051 --> 00:23:52.431
Our only hope is for the senate
to side with us.

267
00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:55.220
Senator Palpatine will need your help.

268
00:23:55.385 --> 00:23:59.222
Either choice presents great danger...
to us all.

269
00:23:59.372 --> 00:24:01.059
We are brave, Your Highness.

270
00:24:01.109 --> 00:24:04.369
<i>If you are to leave,
Your Highness, it must be now.</i>

271
00:24:05.211 --> 00:24:07.240
Then I will plead our case to the senate.

272
00:24:08.061 --> 00:24:09.861
Be careful, Governor.

273
00:24:18.885 --> 00:24:21.321
We'll need to free those pilots.

274
00:24:22.181 --> 00:24:24.092
I'll deal with that.

275
00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:28.484
Halt.

276
00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:32.096
I'm ambassador to the supreme chancellor.
I'm taking these people to Coruscant.

277
00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:34.043
Where are you taking them?

278
00:24:34.243 --> 00:24:35.385
To Coruscant.

279
00:24:35.492 --> 00:24:38.138
Coruscant?
Uh, that doesn't compute.

280
00:24:38.239 --> 00:24:40.239
Uh, wait. U h, you're under arrest.

281
00:25:19.113 --> 00:25:22.250
Now, stay here
and keep out of trouble.

282
00:25:25.903 --> 00:25:27.964
Hello, boyos.

283
00:25:35.092 --> 00:25:36.377
There's the blockade.

284
00:25:46.612 --> 00:25:48.356
The shield generator's been hit!

285
00:25:56.566 --> 00:25:58.192
How wude!

286
00:26:08.142 --> 00:26:09.986
We're losing droids fast.

287
00:26:10.645 --> 00:26:13.106
<i>If we can't get the shield generator fixed,
we'll be sitting ducks.</i>

288
00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.668
The shields are gone.

289
00:26:24.733 --> 00:26:26.209
The power's back!

290
00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:30.206
That little droid did it.

291
00:26:30.356 --> 00:26:32.202
<i>He bypassed the main power drive.</i>

292
00:26:32.473 --> 00:26:34.873
Deflector shields up at maximum.

293
00:26:44.637 --> 00:26:48.408
<i>There's not enough power to get us
to Coruscant. The hyperdrive is leaking.</i>

294
00:26:48.558 --> 00:26:51.411
We'll have to land somewhere
to refuel and repair the ship.

295
00:26:51.469 --> 00:26:53.529
Here, Master. Tatooine.

296
00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:55.459
It's small, out of the way, poor.

297
00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:57.760
The Trade Federation
have no presence there.

298
00:26:57.867 --> 00:26:59.321
How can you be sure?

299
00:26:59.422 --> 00:27:01.222
It's controlled by the Hutts.

300
00:27:01.429 --> 00:27:04.175
You can't take Her Royal Highness there.
The Hutts are gangsters.

301
00:27:04.306 --> 00:27:06.606
- If they discovered her...
- It'd be no different than landing...

302
00:27:06.707 --> 00:27:09.007
...on a system
controlled by the Federation...

303
00:27:09.112 --> 00:27:13.174
...except that the Hutts aren't looking for her,
which gives us the advantage.

304
00:27:17.779 --> 00:27:20.665
<i>And Queen Amidala, has
she signed the treaty?</i>

305
00:27:20.824 --> 00:27:24.209
She has disappeared, my lord.

306
00:27:24.514 --> 00:27:28.660
One Naboo cruiser got past the blockade.

307
00:27:29.315 --> 00:27:31.976
<i>I want that treaty signed.</i>

308
00:27:32.218 --> 00:27:36.614
My lord...
it's impossible to locate the ship.

309
00:27:36.673 --> 00:27:38.836
It's out of our range.

310
00:27:38.937 --> 00:27:41.437
<i>Not for a Sith.</i>

311
00:27:42.198 --> 00:27:43.808
<i>This is my apprentice...</i>

312
00:27:43.881 --> 00:27:45.891
<i>Darth Maul.</i>

313
00:27:47.158 --> 00:27:50.561
<i>He will find your lost ship.</i>

314
00:27:54.785 --> 00:27:57.039
This is getting out of hand.

315
00:27:57.116 --> 00:27:59.316
Now there are two of them.

316
00:27:59.746 --> 00:28:02.565
We should not have made this bargain.

317
00:28:07.979 --> 00:28:11.149
An extremely well-put-together
little droid, Your Highness.

318
00:28:11.399 --> 00:28:13.943
Without a doubt, it saved the ship,
as well as our lives.

319
00:28:14.314 --> 00:28:17.784
It is to be commended.
What is its number?

320
00:28:20.266 --> 00:28:22.353
R2-D2, Your Highness.

321
00:28:22.514 --> 00:28:24.314
Thank you, R2-D2.

322
00:28:27.932 --> 00:28:29.233
Padmé.

323
00:28:30.752 --> 00:28:32.662
Clean this droid up as best you can.

324
00:28:33.157 --> 00:28:35.034
It deserves our gratitude.

325
00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:38.661
Continue, Captain.

326
00:28:41.104 --> 00:28:42.667
Your Highness, with your permission...

327
00:28:42.768 --> 00:28:46.068
...we're heading for a remote planet
called Tatooine.

328
00:28:46.201 --> 00:28:49.388
It's in a system far beyond the reach
of the Trade Federation.

329
00:28:49.871 --> 00:28:52.181
I do not agree with the Jedi on this.

330
00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:55.306
You must trust my judgment,
Your Highness.

331
00:28:58.521 --> 00:28:59.947
<i>Hello.</i>

332
00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:03.709
Sorry.
Husa are yousa?

333
00:29:04.728 --> 00:29:05.962
I'm Padmé.

334
00:29:07.006 --> 00:29:09.033
Mesa Jar Jar Binks.

335
00:29:09.946 --> 00:29:11.439
You're a Gungan, aren't you?

336
00:29:13.686 --> 00:29:17.107
- How'd you end up here with us?
- My no know.

337
00:29:17.405 --> 00:29:20.952
Mesa day starten pitty okeyday
witda brisky morning munchen.

338
00:29:21.043 --> 00:29:23.743
Den boom! Getten berry scared...

339
00:29:23.862 --> 00:29:27.490
...and grabben dat Jedi,
and pow... mesa here.

340
00:29:28.557 --> 00:29:31.044
Mesa getten berry, berry scared.

341
00:29:37.385 --> 00:29:40.688
- That's it... Tatooine.
- There's a settlement.

342
00:29:40.762 --> 00:29:44.699
Land near the outskirts.
We don't want to attract attention.

343
00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:04.893
The hyperdrive generator's gone, Master.
We'll need a new one.

344
00:30:05.013 --> 00:30:09.309
That'll complicate things. Be wary.
I sense a disturbance in the Force.

345
00:30:09.517 --> 00:30:13.546
- I feel it also, Master.
- Don't let them send any transmissions.

346
00:30:18.785 --> 00:30:21.214
The sun doen murder to mesa skin.

347
00:30:21.315 --> 00:30:22.915
<i>Wait!</i>

348
00:30:24.023 --> 00:30:25.500
Wait.

349
00:30:28.845 --> 00:30:31.798
Her Highness commands you
to take her handmaiden with you.

350
00:30:32.182 --> 00:30:34.941
No more commands
from Her Highness today, Captain.

351
00:30:35.925 --> 00:30:38.085
The spaceport is not going to be pleasant.

352
00:30:38.204 --> 00:30:39.966
The queen wishes it.

353
00:30:40.107 --> 00:30:42.107
She's curious about the planet.

354
00:30:44.535 --> 00:30:45.712
This is not a good idea.

355
00:30:45.828 --> 00:30:47.855
Stay close to me.

356
00:31:01.461 --> 00:31:04.331
Moisture farms, for the most part.

357
00:31:05.578 --> 00:31:09.048
Some indigenous tribes and scavengers.

358
00:31:09.427 --> 00:31:11.314
The few spaceports like this one...

359
00:31:11.355 --> 00:31:13.655
...are havens for those
that don't wish to be found.

360
00:31:13.848 --> 00:31:15.516
Like us.

361
00:31:17.101 --> 00:31:19.887
Dissen berry, berry bad.

362
00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:38.833
We'll try one of the smaller dealers.

363
00:31:44.003 --> 00:31:45.930
Good day to you.

364
00:31:47.624 --> 00:31:49.053
What do you want?

365
00:31:49.114 --> 00:31:52.214
I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.

366
00:31:52.353 --> 00:31:56.496
Ah, yes! Nubian.
We have lots of that.

367
00:31:57.116 --> 00:31:58.995
Boy, get in here now!

368
00:31:59.146 --> 00:32:01.646
My droid has a readout of what I need.

369
00:32:03.635 --> 00:32:05.328
What took you so long?

370
00:32:06.167 --> 00:32:07.622
I was cleaning the fan switches.

371
00:32:07.723 --> 00:32:10.423
Watch the store.
I've got some selling to do.

372
00:32:12.407 --> 00:32:14.133
Let me take thee out back, huh?

373
00:32:14.283 --> 00:32:17.037
We'll find what you need.

374
00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:20.290
Don't touch anything.

375
00:32:30.367 --> 00:32:33.419
- Are you an angel?
- What?

376
00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:37.208
An angel. I heard the deep space pilots
talk about them.

377
00:32:37.298 --> 00:32:40.151
They're the most beautiful creatures
in the universe.

378
00:32:40.311 --> 00:32:42.989
They live on the moons of Iego, I think.

379
00:32:43.301 --> 00:32:45.312
You're a funny little boy.

380
00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:47.236
How do you know so much?

381
00:32:47.387 --> 00:32:51.287
I listen to all the traders
and star pilots who come through here.

382
00:32:51.392 --> 00:32:55.688
I'm a pilot, you know, and someday
I'm gonna fly away from this place.

383
00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:59.801
- You're a pilot?
- Mm-hmm. All my life.

384
00:33:00.116 --> 00:33:02.136
How long have you been here?

385
00:33:02.275 --> 00:33:06.280
Since I was very little.
Three, I think.

386
00:33:06.431 --> 00:33:09.131
My mom and I were sold
to Gardulla the Hutt...

387
00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:11.866
...but she lost us
betting on the Podraces.

388
00:33:12.355 --> 00:33:13.965
You're a slave?

389
00:33:14.224 --> 00:33:18.693
- I'm a person, and my name is Anakin.
- I'm sorry.

390
00:33:18.989 --> 00:33:22.476
I don't fully understand.
This is a strange place to me.

391
00:33:26.331 --> 00:33:28.341
I got ya.

392
00:33:36.515 --> 00:33:38.092
Hit the nose.

393
00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:46.094
A T-14 hyperdrive generator.
Thee in luck.

394
00:33:46.222 --> 00:33:48.658
I'm the only one hereabouts
who has one.

395
00:33:48.694 --> 00:33:53.081
But thee might as well buy a new ship.
It would be cheaper, I think, huh.

396
00:33:54.067 --> 00:33:55.587
Saying of which...

397
00:33:55.688 --> 00:33:58.088
...how's thee gonna pay for all this, huh?

398
00:33:58.231 --> 00:34:00.391
I have 20,000 Republic dataries.

399
00:34:00.482 --> 00:34:02.178
Republic credits?

400
00:34:02.279 --> 00:34:05.279
Republic credits are no good out here.
I need something more real.

401
00:34:05.387 --> 00:34:08.406
I don't have anything else,
but credits will do fine.

402
00:34:08.565 --> 00:34:12.268
- No, they won't.
- Credits will do fine.

403
00:34:12.358 --> 00:34:14.185
No, they won't!

404
00:34:14.292 --> 00:34:18.481
What, you think you're some kind of Jedi,
waving your hand around like that?

405
00:34:18.542 --> 00:34:23.245
I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks
don't work on me. Only money.

406
00:34:23.588 --> 00:34:27.116
No money, no parts, no deal.

407
00:34:27.287 --> 00:34:31.849
And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive,
I promise you that.

408
00:34:38.656 --> 00:34:42.902
Wouldn't have lasted long anyways
if I wasn't so good at building things.

409
00:34:46.593 --> 00:34:48.803
We're leaving. Jar Jar.

410
00:34:51.241 --> 00:34:53.535
I'm glad to have met you, Anakin.

411
00:34:53.885 --> 00:34:55.628
I was glad to meet you too.

412
00:35:04.153 --> 00:35:08.716
Outlanders.
They think we know nothing.

413
00:35:08.858 --> 00:35:10.685
They seemed nice to me.

414
00:35:11.004 --> 00:35:12.647
Clean the racks...

415
00:35:12.837 --> 00:35:14.448
...then you can go home.

416
00:35:22.147 --> 00:35:24.542
<i>And you're sure there's
nothing left on board?</i>

417
00:35:24.643 --> 00:35:26.643
A few containers of supplies.

418
00:35:26.843 --> 00:35:29.939
The queen's wardrobe, maybe,
but not enough for you to barter with...

419
00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:32.140
...not in the amount you're talking about.

420
00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:35.149
All right. I'm sure
another solution will present itself.

421
00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:36.700
I'll check back later.

422
00:35:37.335 --> 00:35:42.381
Noah gain. Noah gain.
Da beings hereabouts, cawazy!

423
00:35:42.542 --> 00:35:44.897
Wesa be wobbed un crunched.

424
00:35:44.998 --> 00:35:47.898
Not likely. We have nothing of value.
That's our problem.

425
00:36:03.421 --> 00:36:05.132
Are you going to pay for that?

426
00:36:06.874 --> 00:36:08.701
It costs seven wupiupi.

427
00:36:19.876 --> 00:36:21.553
Is this yours?

428
00:36:21.694 --> 00:36:23.394
Who, mesa...

429
00:36:27.979 --> 00:36:29.772
Careful, Sebulba.

430
00:36:29.923 --> 00:36:31.866
He's a big-time outlander.

431
00:36:32.067 --> 00:36:35.336
I'd hate to see you diced
before we race again.

432
00:36:35.654 --> 00:36:39.673
Next time we race, boy,
it will be the end of you.

433
00:36:39.782 --> 00:36:42.694
If you weren't a slave,
I'd squash you now.

434
00:36:43.369 --> 00:36:46.339
Yeah, it'd be a pity
if you had to pay for me.

435
00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:49.940
- Hi.
- Hi there.

436
00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:53.272
<i>Your buddy here was
about to be turned into orange goo.</i>

437
00:36:53.312 --> 00:36:57.031
He picked a fight with a Dug,
an especially dangerous Dug called Sebulba.

438
00:36:57.202 --> 00:37:01.105
Mesa haten crunchen.
Das da las ting mesa want.

439
00:37:01.341 --> 00:37:05.094
Nevertheless, the boy is right.
You were heading into trouble.

440
00:37:05.767 --> 00:37:07.594
Thanks, my young friend.

441
00:37:09.287 --> 00:37:12.107
But mesa doen nutten!

442
00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:22.189
This storm will slow them down.

443
00:37:22.333 --> 00:37:24.293
Looks pretty bad.

444
00:37:25.603 --> 00:37:26.103
Panaka.

445
00:37:26.114 --> 00:37:27.517
<i>Receiving a message from home.</i>

446
00:37:27.608 --> 00:37:29.108
We'll be right there.

447
00:37:36.092 --> 00:37:38.352
<i>Here, you'll like these pallies.</i>

448
00:37:38.401 --> 00:37:40.902
- Here.
- Thank you.

449
00:37:42.075 --> 00:37:44.186
<i>My bones are aching.</i>

450
00:37:44.645 --> 00:37:48.841
Storm's coming up, Ani.
You better get home quick.

451
00:37:49.162 --> 00:37:52.015
- Do you have shelter?
- We'll head back to our ship.

452
00:37:52.123 --> 00:37:54.959
- Is it far?
- It's on the outskirts.

453
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:57.283
You'll never reach the outskirts in time.

454
00:37:57.393 --> 00:38:01.205
Sandstorms are very, very dangerous.

455
00:38:01.376 --> 00:38:04.112
Come on.
I'll take you to my place.

456
00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:19.740
Mom!

457
00:38:19.841 --> 00:38:23.278
<i>- Mom, I'm home!
- Ah, dissen cozy.</i>

458
00:38:23.511 --> 00:38:26.122
- These are my friends, Mom.
- Hello.

459
00:38:26.299 --> 00:38:29.852
- I'm Qui-Gon Jinn.
- I'm building a droid. You wanna see?

460
00:38:29.998 --> 00:38:32.325
Your son was kind enough
to offer us shelter.

461
00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:34.631
Come on. I'll show you 3PO.

462
00:38:43.948 --> 00:38:47.235
Isn't he great?
He's not finished yet.

463
00:38:47.429 --> 00:38:48.796
He's wonderful.

464
00:38:50.063 --> 00:38:51.606
<i>You really like him?</i>

465
00:38:51.896 --> 00:38:55.332
He's a protocol droid
to help Mom. Watch.

466
00:38:59.347 --> 00:39:01.083
Where is everybody?

467
00:39:05.002 --> 00:39:06.239
Oh, hello.

468
00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:09.840
I am C-3PO, human cyborg relations.

469
00:39:09.998 --> 00:39:11.527
How might I serve you?

470
00:39:11.538 --> 00:39:13.738
- He's perfect.
- Oh. Perfect.

471
00:39:13.757 --> 00:39:18.294
When the storm is over, I'll show you my racer.
I'm building a Podracer.

472
00:39:19.602 --> 00:39:22.106
I'm not sure this floor is entirely stable.

473
00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:25.614
Hello. I don't believe
we have been introduced.

474
00:39:27.337 --> 00:39:29.575
R2-D2. A pleasure to meet you.

475
00:39:29.656 --> 00:39:32.856
I am C-3PO, human cyborg relations.

476
00:39:35.741 --> 00:39:38.928
I beg your pardon,
but what do you mean, "naked"?

477
00:39:40.577 --> 00:39:44.047
My parts are showing?
My goodness!

478
00:39:48.429 --> 00:39:53.159
<i>The death toll is catastrophic.
We must bow to their wishes.</i>

479
00:39:53.276 --> 00:39:55.253
<i>You must contact me.</i>

480
00:39:55.571 --> 00:40:00.618
It's a trick. Send no reply.
Send no transmissions of any kind.

481
00:40:02.577 --> 00:40:05.646
It sounds like bait
to establish a connection trace.

482
00:40:05.897 --> 00:40:09.467
What if it is true, and
the people are dying?

483
00:40:09.954 --> 00:40:12.741
Either way, we're running out of time.

484
00:40:25.803 --> 00:40:27.908
Tatooine is sparsely populated.

485
00:40:28.009 --> 00:40:30.709
If the trace was correct,
I will find them quickly, Master.

486
00:40:30.838 --> 00:40:32.699
Move against the Jedi first.

487
00:40:32.849 --> 00:40:37.345
You will then have no difficulty in taking
the queen to Naboo to sign the treaty.

488
00:40:37.595 --> 00:40:39.889
At last we will reveal
ourselves to the Jedi.

489
00:40:40.059 --> 00:40:42.515
At last we will have revenge.

490
00:40:42.636 --> 00:40:45.436
You have been well-trained,
my young apprentice.

491
00:40:45.575 --> 00:40:47.852
They will be no match for you.

492
00:40:52.765 --> 00:40:56.828
All slaves have a transmitter
placed inside their bodies somewhere.

493
00:40:58.233 --> 00:41:01.069
I've been working on a scanner
to try and locate mine.

494
00:41:01.169 --> 00:41:05.172
- Any attempt to escape...
- And they blow you up!

495
00:41:05.535 --> 00:41:07.178
How wude!

496
00:41:07.307 --> 00:41:09.786
I can't believe
there's still slavery in the galaxy.

497
00:41:09.907 --> 00:41:11.707
The Republic's antislavery laws...

498
00:41:11.751 --> 00:41:13.955
The Republic doesn't exist out here.

499
00:41:14.056 --> 00:41:16.256
<i>We must survive on our own.</i>

500
00:41:17.819 --> 00:41:19.312
Xcuse me.

501
00:41:20.964 --> 00:41:23.399
Has anybody ever seen a Podrace?

502
00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:25.383
<i>They have Podracing on Malastare.</i>

503
00:41:25.585 --> 00:41:28.129
Very fast, very dangerous.

504
00:41:28.850 --> 00:41:30.810
I'm the only human who can do it.

505
00:41:30.885 --> 00:41:33.888
You must have Jedi
reflexes if you race pods.

506
00:41:35.149 --> 00:41:37.969
Don't do that again.

507
00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:44.452
You're a Jedi knight, aren't you?

508
00:41:47.585 --> 00:41:49.061
What makes you think that?

509
00:41:49.079 --> 00:41:53.291
I saw your laser sword.
Only Jedis carry that kind of weapon.

510
00:41:53.581 --> 00:41:56.668
Perhaps I killed a Jedi
and took it from him.

511
00:41:57.236 --> 00:41:58.596
I don't think so.

512
00:41:58.675 --> 00:42:00.771
No one can kill a Jedi.

513
00:42:01.432 --> 00:42:03.432
I wish that were so.

514
00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:08.554
I had a dream I was a Jedi.
I came back here and freed all the slaves.

515
00:42:09.175 --> 00:42:12.495
- Have you come to free us?
- No, I'm afraid not.

516
00:42:12.804 --> 00:42:16.816
I think you have.
Why else would you be here?

517
00:42:22.196 --> 00:42:24.616
I can see there's no fooling you, Anakin.

518
00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:27.833
We're on our way to Coruscant,
the central system in the Republic...

519
00:42:27.904 --> 00:42:29.904
...on a very important mission.

520
00:42:30.283 --> 00:42:32.961
How did you end up out here
in the outer rim?

521
00:42:33.252 --> 00:42:37.062
<i>Our ship was damaged, and we're
stranded here until we can repair it.</i>

522
00:42:38.066 --> 00:42:39.093
I can help.

523
00:42:39.189 --> 00:42:43.092
<i>I can fix anything.
- I believe you can.</i>

524
00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:45.856
But first we must acquire
the parts we need.

525
00:42:45.937 --> 00:42:48.637
Wit no-nutten mula to trade.

526
00:42:48.793 --> 00:42:52.246
These junk dealers
must have a weakness of some kind.

527
00:42:52.422 --> 00:42:56.875
Gambling. Everything here revolves
around betting on those awful races.

528
00:42:57.026 --> 00:42:58.226
<i>Podracing.</i>

529
00:42:58.832 --> 00:43:01.025
Greed can be a powerful ally.

530
00:43:01.206 --> 00:43:04.075
I built a racer.
It's the fastest ever.

531
00:43:04.374 --> 00:43:06.776
There's a big race tomorrow
on Boonta Eve.

532
00:43:06.856 --> 00:43:08.300
You could enter my pod.

533
00:43:08.369 --> 00:43:12.772
- Anakin, Watto won't let you.
- Watto doesn't know I've built it.

534
00:43:12.983 --> 00:43:14.683
You could make him think
it was yours...

535
00:43:14.833 --> 00:43:16.962
<i>...and get him to let me pilot it for you.</i>

536
00:43:16.973 --> 00:43:18.573
<i>I don't want you to race.
It's awful.</i>

537
00:43:18.698 --> 00:43:21.301
<i>I die every time
Watto makes you do it.</i>

538
00:43:21.451 --> 00:43:23.495
<i>But, Mom, I love it.</i>

539
00:43:24.195 --> 00:43:27.048
The prize money would more than pay
for the parts they need.

540
00:43:28.099 --> 00:43:29.499
Anakin.

541
00:43:30.076 --> 00:43:32.136
Your mother's right.

542
00:43:32.834 --> 00:43:36.253
Is there anyone friendly to the Republic
who can help us?

543
00:43:37.175 --> 00:43:38.609
No.

544
00:43:44.224 --> 00:43:48.820
Mom, you say the biggest problem in this
universe is nobody helps each other.

545
00:43:53.522 --> 00:43:56.485
I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want
to put your son in danger.

546
00:43:56.595 --> 00:43:58.595
We'll find some other way.

547
00:44:01.097 --> 00:44:02.950
There is no other way.

548
00:44:03.426 --> 00:44:07.588
I may not like it, but he can help you.

549
00:44:08.564 --> 00:44:10.917
He was meant to help you.

550
00:44:24.293 --> 00:44:26.037
Are you sure about this?

551
00:44:26.267 --> 00:44:28.928
<i>Trusting our fate to a boy
we hardly know?</i>

552
00:44:29.101 --> 00:44:30.911
The queen will not approve.

553
00:44:31.079 --> 00:44:33.131
The queen doesn't need to know.

554
00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:35.990
Well, I don't approve.

555
00:44:36.834 --> 00:44:39.337
The boy tells me you want
to sponsor him in the race.

556
00:44:39.621 --> 00:44:41.147
How can you do this?

557
00:44:41.305 --> 00:44:44.374
Not on the Republic credits, I think.

558
00:44:44.559 --> 00:44:46.703
My ship will be the entry fee.

559
00:44:48.414 --> 00:44:52.314
Not bad! Not bad, huh?
Nubian, huh?

560
00:44:52.605 --> 00:44:55.442
It's in good order,
except for the parts I need.

561
00:44:55.570 --> 00:44:59.589
<i>What would the boy ride?
He smashed up my pod in the last race.</i>

562
00:44:59.639 --> 00:45:01.860
It would take some long time to fix it.

563
00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:06.422
It wasn't my fault. Really.
Sebulba flashed me with his vents.

564
00:45:06.592 --> 00:45:08.736
<i>I actually saved the pod.</i>

565
00:45:08.791 --> 00:45:10.418
Mostly.

566
00:45:10.902 --> 00:45:13.082
That you did.

567
00:45:13.433 --> 00:45:16.233
The boy's good.
No doubts there, huh?

568
00:45:16.416 --> 00:45:20.645
I have acquired a pod in a game of chance.
The fastest ever built.

569
00:45:21.004 --> 00:45:26.033
I hope you didn't kill
anyone I know for it, huh?

570
00:45:27.806 --> 00:45:31.402
So, you supply the pod and the entry fee...

571
00:45:31.543 --> 00:45:32.943
...and I supply the boy.

572
00:45:33.049 --> 00:45:36.536
We split the winnings 50-50, I think, huh?

573
00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:41.296
If it's going to be 50-50,
I suggest you front the cash for the entry.

574
00:45:41.875 --> 00:45:43.704
If we win...

575
00:45:43.938 --> 00:45:47.638
...you keep all the winnings,
minus the cost of the parts I need.

576
00:45:47.788 --> 00:45:51.232
And if we lose, you keep my ship.

577
00:45:53.578 --> 00:45:55.581
Either way, you win.

578
00:46:00.792 --> 00:46:02.335
Deal!

579
00:46:07.708 --> 00:46:11.162
Your friend is a foolish one, methinks.

580
00:46:19.561 --> 00:46:22.313
What if this plan fails, Master?

581
00:46:22.474 --> 00:46:25.079
We could be stuck here a very long time.

582
00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:27.890
<i>Well, it's too dangerous
to call for help...</i>

583
00:46:28.121 --> 00:46:31.207
...and a ship without a power supply
isn't going to get us anywhere.

584
00:46:31.416 --> 00:46:33.353
And...

585
00:46:33.654 --> 00:46:35.854
...there's something about this boy.

586
00:46:42.284 --> 00:46:44.595
You should be very proud of your son.

587
00:46:45.423 --> 00:46:47.575
<i>He gives without any thought of reward.</i>

588
00:46:47.936 --> 00:46:50.589
He knows nothing of greed.

589
00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:52.220
He has...

590
00:46:53.004 --> 00:46:55.165
He has special powers.

591
00:46:56.524 --> 00:46:57.759
Yes.

592
00:46:58.331 --> 00:47:00.561
He can see things before they happen.

593
00:47:00.682 --> 00:47:03.382
That's why he appears
to have such quick reflexes.

594
00:47:03.653 --> 00:47:05.332
<i>It's a Jedi trait.</i>

595
00:47:05.453 --> 00:47:08.053
<i>He deserves better than a slave's life.</i>

596
00:47:08.411 --> 00:47:11.865
Had he been born in the Republic,
we would have identified him early.

597
00:47:14.165 --> 00:47:17.685
The Force is unusually strong with him.
That much is clear.

598
00:47:18.354 --> 00:47:20.231
Who was his father?

599
00:47:22.712 --> 00:47:24.506
There was no father.

600
00:47:26.037 --> 00:47:29.490
<i>I carried him, I gave birth,
I raised him.</i>

601
00:47:30.333 --> 00:47:32.577
I can't explain what happened.

602
00:47:34.721 --> 00:47:36.281
Can you help him?

603
00:47:36.982 --> 00:47:38.266
I don't know.

604
00:47:40.850 --> 00:47:44.054
I didn't actually come here
to free slaves.

605
00:47:57.668 --> 00:47:59.829
Wow, a real astro droid!

606
00:48:01.389 --> 00:48:05.059
- How do you get so lucky?
- That isn't the half of it.

607
00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:08.386
- I'm in the Boonta race tomorrow.
- What?

608
00:48:08.611 --> 00:48:09.921
With this?

609
00:48:10.081 --> 00:48:12.625
You're such a joker, Ani.

610
00:48:12.867 --> 00:48:16.213
- You've been working on that for years.
- It's never gonna run.

611
00:48:16.372 --> 00:48:18.423
<i>Come on.
Let's go and play ball.</i>

612
00:48:18.723 --> 00:48:22.586
Keep racing, Ani.
You're gonna be bug squash.

613
00:48:29.584 --> 00:48:30.818
Hey, Jar Jar!

614
00:48:30.977 --> 00:48:32.737
Keep away from those energy binders.

615
00:48:32.786 --> 00:48:36.622
If your hand gets caught in the beam,
it's gonna go numb for hours.

616
00:48:41.571 --> 00:48:44.390
My tongue is fat.

617
00:48:44.734 --> 00:48:47.278
My tongue... Wrench.

618
00:48:47.469 --> 00:48:50.012
Where is de wrench?
Oh, dare it is.

619
00:48:54.709 --> 00:48:56.135
I'm stuck.

620
00:48:56.694 --> 00:49:00.465
You know, I find that Jar Jar creature
to be a little odd.

621
00:49:02.125 --> 00:49:05.061
You don't even know if
this thing's gonna run.

622
00:49:05.161 --> 00:49:07.164
- It will.
- I think it's time we found out.

623
00:49:07.223 --> 00:49:09.576
- Here, use this power charge.
- Yes, sir!

624
00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:11.840
Come on, Kitster.
Let's move away.

625
00:49:12.661 --> 00:49:13.887
My mouth.

626
00:49:14.108 --> 00:49:16.108
<i>Ani, I'm stuck.</i>

627
00:49:20.707 --> 00:49:22.717
My tongue is fat.

628
00:49:22.879 --> 00:49:25.832
You're quite right.
He's very odd indeed.

629
00:49:28.643 --> 00:49:30.236
Thank you.

630
00:49:46.694 --> 00:49:50.181
It's working! It's working!

631
00:50:00.550 --> 00:50:03.019
Stay still, Ani.
Let me clean this cut.

632
00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:07.623
There's so many.
Do they all have a system of planets?

633
00:50:07.941 --> 00:50:09.242
Most of them.

634
00:50:09.592 --> 00:50:12.496
Has anyone been to 'em all?

635
00:50:12.954 --> 00:50:14.397
Not likely.

636
00:50:14.756 --> 00:50:17.809
I wanna be the first one to see 'em all.

637
00:50:18.590 --> 00:50:20.942
<i>Ani, bedtime!</i>

638
00:50:21.202 --> 00:50:23.655
There we are. Good as new.

639
00:50:23.857 --> 00:50:26.693
Ani, I'm not gonna tell you again.

640
00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:30.596
- What are you doing?
- Checking your blood for infections.

641
00:50:30.655 --> 00:50:32.055
Go on.

642
00:50:32.206 --> 00:50:34.050
You have a big day tomorrow.

643
00:50:34.509 --> 00:50:36.119
Sleep well, Ani.

644
00:50:39.025 --> 00:50:41.244
- Obi-Wan?
- Yes, Master?

645
00:50:41.374 --> 00:50:43.885
I need an analysis
of this blood sample I'm sending you.

646
00:50:44.542 --> 00:50:46.119
Wait a minute.

647
00:50:47.432 --> 00:50:49.492
I need a midi-chlorian count.

648
00:50:52.782 --> 00:50:56.928
The reading is off the chart.
Over 20,000.

649
00:50:57.063 --> 00:51:00.643
<i>Even Master Yoda doesn't have
a midi-chlorian count that high.</i>

650
00:51:00.804 --> 00:51:02.504
No Jedi has.

651
00:51:02.794 --> 00:51:04.671
What does that mean?

652
00:51:05.538 --> 00:51:07.441
I'm not sure.

653
00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:20.106
I wanna see your spaceship
the moment the race is over.

654
00:52:20.207 --> 00:52:21.807
Patience, my blue friend.

655
00:52:21.966 --> 00:52:24.279
You'll have your winnings
before the suns set.

656
00:52:24.399 --> 00:52:26.195
And we'll be far away from here.

657
00:52:26.351 --> 00:52:30.151
Not if your ship belongs
to me, I think, huh?

658
00:52:30.688 --> 00:52:34.058
I warn you, no funny business.

659
00:52:34.252 --> 00:52:37.421
- You don't think Anakin can win?
- Don't get me wrongo.

660
00:52:37.730 --> 00:52:39.843
I have great faith in the boy.

661
00:52:39.929 --> 00:52:41.829
He's a credit to your race.

662
00:52:41.978 --> 00:52:45.581
But Sebulba there is going to win, I think.

663
00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:49.223
Oh, no!

664
00:52:53.723 --> 00:52:55.183
Why do you think that?

665
00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:57.554
He always wins!

666
00:52:59.004 --> 00:53:01.817
I am betting heavily on Sebulba.

667
00:53:03.534 --> 00:53:06.219
- I'll take that bet.
- What?

668
00:53:07.103 --> 00:53:12.375
I'll wager my new racing pod
against, say... the boy and his mother.

669
00:53:12.479 --> 00:53:16.565
No pod is worth two slaves,
not by a long shot.

670
00:53:17.130 --> 00:53:18.773
The boy, then.

671
00:53:25.021 --> 00:53:27.598
We'll let fate decide, huh?

672
00:53:27.816 --> 00:53:31.335
I just happen to have a chance cube here.

673
00:53:31.661 --> 00:53:34.273
Blue, it's the boy.

674
00:53:34.474 --> 00:53:35.974
Red...

675
00:53:36.991 --> 00:53:38.801
...his mother.

676
00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:52.469
You won this small toss, outlander,
but you won't win the race!

677
00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:55.093
So it makes little difference!

678
00:54:05.191 --> 00:54:10.213
Better stop your friend's betting
or I'll end up owning him too.

679
00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:16.160
- What'd he mean by that?
- I'll tell you later.

680
00:54:16.241 --> 00:54:17.641
Good morning.

681
00:54:19.784 --> 00:54:22.828
Oh, my. Space travel
sounds rather perilous.

682
00:54:24.581 --> 00:54:28.659
I can assure you, they will never get me
onto one of those dreadful starships.

683
00:54:28.777 --> 00:54:32.563
This is so wizard, Ani.
I'm sure you'll do it this time.

684
00:54:32.702 --> 00:54:36.305
- Do what?
- Finish the race, of course.

685
00:54:36.839 --> 00:54:40.969
- You've never won a race?
- Well, not exactly.

686
00:54:41.454 --> 00:54:43.267
Not even finished?

687
00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:45.800
Kitster's right. I will this time.

688
00:54:46.151 --> 00:54:47.944
Of course you will.

689
00:55:17.767 --> 00:55:19.287
<i>That's absolutely right.</i>

690
00:55:19.346 --> 00:55:24.934
<i>And a big turnout here from all corners
of the outer rim territories.</i>

691
00:55:25.015 --> 00:55:29.085
<i>I see the contestants are making
their way out onto the starting grid.</i>

692
00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:34.426
<i>I see Ben Quadinaros
from the Tund System.</i>

693
00:55:39.140 --> 00:55:41.740
<i>Two-time winner Boles Roor.</i>

694
00:55:44.328 --> 00:55:45.728
<i>Sebulba!</i>

695
00:55:56.164 --> 00:55:59.250
<i>And in the front row,
nearside pole position...</i>

696
00:55:59.425 --> 00:56:01.686
<i>Mawhonic!</i>

697
00:56:03.131 --> 00:56:04.675
<i>A hearty hello...</i>

698
00:56:04.786 --> 00:56:08.656
<i>...to Clegg Holdfast
and his Voltec KT9 Wasp!</i>

699
00:56:12.001 --> 00:56:14.604
<i>And back again,
it's the mighty Dud Bolt...</i>

700
00:56:14.749 --> 00:56:19.595
<i>...with that incredible racing machine,
the Vulptereen 327.</i>

701
00:56:22.654 --> 00:56:25.006
<i>And hoping for a big win today...</i>

702
00:56:25.175 --> 00:56:30.054
<i>...Ody Mandrell,
with his record-setting pit droid team.</i>

703
00:56:34.454 --> 00:56:39.550
<i>And a late entry,
young Anakin Skywalker, a local boy.</i>

704
00:56:41.618 --> 00:56:44.045
<i>I see the flags are moving
out onto the track.</i>

705
00:57:04.307 --> 00:57:05.950
Be safe.

706
00:57:06.125 --> 00:57:08.819
I will, Mom. I promise.

707
00:57:24.469 --> 00:57:26.988
You won't walk away from this one...

708
00:57:27.188 --> 00:57:29.415
...you slave scum.

709
00:57:29.908 --> 00:57:32.727
Don't count on it, slime ball.

710
00:57:32.977 --> 00:57:35.980
You're bantha fodder!

711
00:57:39.914 --> 00:57:42.283
- You all set, Ani?
- Yep.

712
00:57:48.005 --> 00:57:50.631
Remember, concentrate on the moment.

713
00:57:50.879 --> 00:57:54.707
Feel, don't think.
Use your instincts.

714
00:57:55.263 --> 00:57:56.497
I will.

715
00:57:56.885 --> 00:57:59.087
May the Force be with you.

716
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:23.544
Welcome.

717
00:58:25.239 --> 00:58:28.076
Begin the race!

718
00:58:39.230 --> 00:58:42.050
<i>Hey, looks like they're clearing the grid.</i>

719
00:58:43.422 --> 00:58:45.875
- Is he nervous?
- He's fine.

720
00:58:47.063 --> 00:58:49.949
You Jedi are far too reckless.
The queen is not...

721
00:58:49.980 --> 00:58:52.842
The queen trusts my judgment,
young handmaiden.

722
00:58:52.943 --> 00:58:54.943
You should too.

723
00:58:55.300 --> 00:58:57.311
You assume too much.

724
00:58:58.040 --> 00:59:00.683
<i>Start your engines.</i>

725
00:59:39.753 --> 00:59:43.123
Oh, dissen gonna be messy.
Me no watch'n!

726
01:00:10.476 --> 01:00:13.696
<i>Wait.
Little Skywalker has stalled.</i>

727
01:00:24.107 --> 01:00:27.994
<i>It looks like Quadinaros
is having engine trouble also.</i>

728
01:00:29.551 --> 01:00:30.918
Come on, Ani!

729
01:00:37.321 --> 01:00:38.915
<i>And there goes Skywalker!</i>

730
01:00:39.316 --> 01:00:40.216
Go, Ani, go!

731
01:00:40.290 --> 01:00:42.717
<i>He will be hard-pressed
to catch up with the leaders.</i>

732
01:01:56.746 --> 01:02:02.049
<i>Looks like a few Tusken Raiders
are camped out on the canyon dune turn.</i>

733
01:02:13.658 --> 01:02:17.295
<i>There goes Quadinaros' power coupling.</i>

734
01:02:51.953 --> 01:02:54.189
Where is Master Anakin?

735
01:02:57.330 --> 01:02:59.173
Look. Here he comes.

736
01:03:02.215 --> 01:03:04.659
<i>It looks like Skywalker
is moving up in the field.</i>

737
01:03:14.204 --> 01:03:17.740
He has to complete
two more circuits? Oh, dear.

738
01:04:25.398 --> 01:04:27.375
<i>Skywalker's spinning out of control!</i>

739
01:05:25.100 --> 01:05:29.153
<i>I don't care what universe you're from.
That's gotta hurt!</i>

740
01:05:36.161 --> 01:05:37.487
Here he comes!

741
01:05:37.516 --> 01:05:40.902
<i>At the start of the third and final lap,
Sebulba's in the lead...</i>

742
01:05:40.991 --> 01:05:43.701
<i>...followed closely by Skywalker!</i>

743
01:05:43.902 --> 01:05:45.102
Go, Ani!

744
01:06:11.721 --> 01:06:14.658
<i>Skywalker's been forced
onto the service ramp!</i>

745
01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:37.124
<i>It's Skywalker!</i>

746
01:06:39.562 --> 01:06:44.016
<i>Amazing! A quick control thrust,
and he's back on course!</i>

747
01:06:44.237 --> 01:06:45.797
Did he crash-ed?

748
01:07:26.638 --> 01:07:29.824
<i>Skywalker's in trouble!
Sebulba takes the lead!</i>

749
01:08:23.061 --> 01:08:24.854
<i>He's catching Sebulba!</i>

750
01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:28.290
Careful, Ani. Careful, Ani!

751
01:08:58.722 --> 01:09:01.558
<i>That little human being
is out of his mind!</i>

752
01:09:02.059 --> 01:09:03.659
<i>They're side by side!</i>

753
01:09:38.195 --> 01:09:39.805
I can't believe it.

754
01:09:39.908 --> 01:09:42.352
<i>The crowds are going nuts!</i>

755
01:09:54.235 --> 01:09:56.762
Mom, I did it! Yay!

756
01:10:07.749 --> 01:10:09.560
Good going, Ani!

757
01:10:14.005 --> 01:10:15.898
We owe you everything, Ani.

758
01:10:18.795 --> 01:10:20.689
It's so wonderful, Ani.

759
01:10:20.766 --> 01:10:23.410
You have brought hope
to those who have none.

760
01:10:23.715 --> 01:10:26.368
I'm so very proud of you.

761
01:10:36.678 --> 01:10:38.104
You!

762
01:10:38.655 --> 01:10:40.749
You swindled me.

763
01:10:40.899 --> 01:10:44.519
You knew the boy was going to win.
Somehow you knew it.

764
01:10:44.945 --> 01:10:46.488
I lost everything.

765
01:10:46.847 --> 01:10:50.067
Whenever you gamble, my friend,
eventually you lose.

766
01:10:50.367 --> 01:10:52.811
Bring the parts to the main hangar.

767
01:10:53.061 --> 01:10:55.731
I'll come by your shop later on
so you can release the boy.

768
01:10:56.148 --> 01:11:00.034
You can't have him.
It wasn't a fair bet.

769
01:11:02.379 --> 01:11:04.998
Would you like to discuss it
with the Hutts?

770
01:11:05.802 --> 01:11:08.105
I'm sure they can settle this.

771
01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:11.563
Take him.

772
01:11:21.406 --> 01:11:23.509
Well, we have all the
essential parts we need.

773
01:11:23.609 --> 01:11:26.670
I'm going back.
Some unfinished business. I won't be long.

774
01:11:26.835 --> 01:11:30.472
Why do I sense we've picked up
another pathetic life-form?

775
01:11:31.033 --> 01:11:34.302
It's the boy who's responsible
for getting us these parts.

776
01:11:34.394 --> 01:11:38.774
- Get this hyperdrive generator installed.
- Yes, Master. That shouldn't take long.

777
01:11:47.227 --> 01:11:49.037
These are yours.

778
01:11:52.554 --> 01:11:55.657
Mom, we sold the pod!
Look at all the money we have!

779
01:11:55.766 --> 01:11:58.126
My goodness!
But that's so wonderful, Ani.

780
01:11:58.185 --> 01:12:00.895
- And he has been freed.
- What?

781
01:12:01.046 --> 01:12:02.856
You're no longer a slave.

782
01:12:04.925 --> 01:12:06.468
Did you hear that?

783
01:12:07.352 --> 01:12:09.896
Now you can make your
dreams come true, Ani.

784
01:12:10.655 --> 01:12:12.307
You are free.

785
01:12:16.306 --> 01:12:17.602
Will you take him with you?

786
01:12:17.633 --> 01:12:20.133
- Is he to become a Jedi?
- Yes.

787
01:12:20.807 --> 01:12:24.653
Our meeting was not a coincidence.
Nothing happens by accident.

788
01:12:24.881 --> 01:12:28.543
You mean I get to come with you
in your starship?

789
01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:30.217
Anakin...

790
01:12:31.835 --> 01:12:35.239
...training to become a Jedi
is not an easy challenge.

791
01:12:35.397 --> 01:12:38.100
And even if you succeed,
it's a hard life.

792
01:12:38.208 --> 01:12:41.611
But I wanna go. It's what
I've always dreamed of doing.

793
01:12:42.254 --> 01:12:44.122
Can I go, Mom?

794
01:12:45.303 --> 01:12:46.883
Anakin...

795
01:12:46.954 --> 01:12:49.854
...this path has been placed before you.

796
01:12:50.061 --> 01:12:52.464
The choice is yours alone.

797
01:12:56.540 --> 01:12:58.225
I wanna do it.

798
01:13:00.331 --> 01:13:02.958
<i>Then pack your things.
We haven't much time.</i>

799
01:13:09.646 --> 01:13:11.223
What about Mom?

800
01:13:14.474 --> 01:13:16.151
Is she free too?

801
01:13:16.522 --> 01:13:19.966
I tried to free your mother, Ani,
but Watto wouldn't have it.

802
01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:23.264
You're coming with us,
aren't you, Mom?

803
01:13:30.850 --> 01:13:34.129
Son, my place is here.
My future is here.

804
01:13:34.514 --> 01:13:36.775
<i>It is time for you to let go.</i>

805
01:13:37.929 --> 01:13:42.209
- I don't want things to change.
- But you can't stop the change...

806
01:13:42.397 --> 01:13:46.043
...any more than you can
stop the suns from setting.

807
01:13:46.735 --> 01:13:48.829
I love you.

808
01:13:54.326 --> 01:13:56.328
Now hurry.

809
01:14:01.859 --> 01:14:02.918
Thank you.

810
01:14:03.126 --> 01:14:06.547
I'll watch after him.
You have my word.

811
01:14:08.257 --> 01:14:10.676
Will you be all right?

812
01:14:17.950 --> 01:14:19.435
Hello, Master Anakin.

813
01:14:19.559 --> 01:14:24.381
Well, 3PO, I've been freed,
and I'm going away in a starship.

814
01:14:24.590 --> 01:14:27.350
Master Anakin, you are my maker
and I wish you well.

815
01:14:27.370 --> 01:14:31.799
However, I should prefer it
if I were a little more completed.

816
01:14:31.930 --> 01:14:34.782
I'm sorry I wasn't able
to finish you, 3PO...

817
01:14:34.975 --> 01:14:36.979
<i>...give you coverings and all.</i>

818
01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:38.780
<i>I'm gonna miss working on you.</i>

819
01:14:38.837 --> 01:14:41.200
You've been a great pal.

820
01:14:41.441 --> 01:14:43.941
I'll make sure Mom
doesn't sell you or anything.

821
01:14:44.715 --> 01:14:45.824
Sell me?

822
01:14:45.985 --> 01:14:47.385
Bye.

823
01:14:48.098 --> 01:14:49.574
Oh, my.

824
01:15:13.675 --> 01:15:16.128
I can't do it, Mom. I just can't do it.

825
01:15:16.345 --> 01:15:17.787
Ani...

826
01:15:20.380 --> 01:15:22.340
Will I ever see you again?

827
01:15:23.779 --> 01:15:26.406
What does your heart tell you?

828
01:15:28.015 --> 01:15:30.242
I hope so.

829
01:15:30.781 --> 01:15:32.409
Yes.

830
01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:34.130
I guess.

831
01:15:35.277 --> 01:15:37.846
Then we will see each other again.

832
01:15:40.474 --> 01:15:43.211
I will come back and free you, Mom.

833
01:15:43.372 --> 01:15:45.072
I promise.

834
01:15:53.362 --> 01:15:56.423
Now, be brave...

835
01:15:57.207 --> 01:15:59.436
...and don't look back.

836
01:15:59.937 --> 01:16:01.837
Don't look back.

837
01:16:46.398 --> 01:16:48.357
Qui-Gon, sir, wait! I'm tired!

838
01:16:48.367 --> 01:16:50.187
Anakin! Drop!

839
01:16:53.951 --> 01:16:56.236
Tell them to take off!

840
01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:10.572
Qui-Gon's in trouble.

841
01:17:11.148 --> 01:17:12.516
Take off.

842
01:17:13.275 --> 01:17:14.902
Over there. Fly low.

843
01:17:36.590 --> 01:17:39.676
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

844
01:17:39.868 --> 01:17:43.063
- What was it?
- I'm not sure.

845
01:17:43.222 --> 01:17:48.368
But it was well-trained in the Jedi arts.
My guess is it was after the queen.

846
01:17:48.685 --> 01:17:50.938
What are we gonna do about it?

847
01:17:53.106 --> 01:17:54.559
We shall be patient.

848
01:17:54.790 --> 01:17:55.990
Anakin Skywalker...

849
01:17:56.518 --> 01:17:58.645
...meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.

850
01:18:00.197 --> 01:18:03.217
You're a Jedi too?
Pleased to meet you.

851
01:18:11.583 --> 01:18:14.396
Your queen is lost,
your people are starving...

852
01:18:14.447 --> 01:18:18.747
...and you, Governor, are going to die
much sooner than your people, I'm afraid.

853
01:18:18.899 --> 01:18:24.488
This invasion will gain you nothing.
We're a democracy. The people have decided.

854
01:18:24.646 --> 01:18:26.590
Take him away.

855
01:18:29.893 --> 01:18:32.373
My troops are in position
to begin searching the swamps...

856
01:18:32.524 --> 01:18:34.924
...for these rumored underwater villages.

857
01:18:35.082 --> 01:18:37.801
They will not stay hidden for long.

858
01:18:49.288 --> 01:18:51.498
<i>The death toll is catastrophic.</i>

859
01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:54.162
<i>We must bow to their wishes.</i>

860
01:18:54.526 --> 01:18:56.570
<i>You must contact me.</i>

861
01:19:11.233 --> 01:19:12.734
You all right?

862
01:19:13.845 --> 01:19:15.898
It's very cold.

863
01:19:23.688 --> 01:19:26.325
You come from a warm planet, Ani.

864
01:19:26.533 --> 01:19:30.954
A little too warm for my taste.
Space is cold.

865
01:19:31.496 --> 01:19:33.290
You seem sad.

866
01:19:34.957 --> 01:19:39.594
The queen is worried.
Her people are suffering, dying.

867
01:19:40.055 --> 01:19:43.075
She must convince the senate
to intervene or...

868
01:19:44.611 --> 01:19:46.872
I'm not sure what'll happen.

869
01:19:48.430 --> 01:19:50.474
I made this for you...

870
01:19:52.075 --> 01:19:53.885
...so you'd remember me.

871
01:19:54.394 --> 01:19:57.039
I carved it out of a japor snippet.

872
01:19:57.539 --> 01:19:59.775
It'll bring you good fortune.

873
01:20:00.217 --> 01:20:01.788
It's beautiful.

874
01:20:02.089 --> 01:20:04.889
But I don't need this
to remember you by.

875
01:20:08.063 --> 01:20:11.784
Many things will change
when we reach the capital, Ani...

876
01:20:11.962 --> 01:20:14.940
...but my caring for you will remain.

877
01:20:17.084 --> 01:20:20.278
I care for you, too, only I...

878
01:20:20.662 --> 01:20:22.514
Miss your mother.

879
01:20:41.149 --> 01:20:45.028
Coruscant.
The entire planet is one big city.

880
01:20:45.237 --> 01:20:47.017
There's Chancellor Valorum's shuttle.

881
01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:50.900
And look over there.
Senator Palpatine is waiting for us.

882
01:21:19.871 --> 01:21:22.816
It is a great gift
to see you alive, Your Majesty.

883
01:21:22.925 --> 01:21:25.995
<i>With the communications breakdown,
we've been very concerned.</i>

884
01:21:26.096 --> 01:21:28.596
<i>I'm anxious to hear your report
on the situation.</i>

885
01:21:28.772 --> 01:21:33.260
- May I present Supreme Chancellor Valorum.
- Welcome, Your Highness.

886
01:21:33.535 --> 01:21:35.570
It's an honor to finally
meet you in person.

887
01:21:35.679 --> 01:21:37.006
<i>Thank you, Supreme Chancellor.</i>

888
01:21:37.215 --> 01:21:40.759
I must relay to you how distressed
everyone is over the current situation.

889
01:21:40.968 --> 01:21:44.471
<i>I've called for a special session
of the senate to hear your position.</i>

890
01:21:45.313 --> 01:21:48.417
I'm grateful for your concern, Chancellor.

891
01:21:48.705 --> 01:21:50.626
There is a question of procedure...

892
01:21:50.697 --> 01:21:53.497
...but I'm confident we can overcome it.

893
01:21:54.081 --> 01:21:56.108
I must speak with the
Jedi Council immediately.

894
01:21:56.266 --> 01:21:58.994
The situation has become
much more complicated.

895
01:22:04.921 --> 01:22:06.740
Ani, come on.

896
01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:20.731
Da queen's a bein grossly nice,
mesa tinks.

897
01:22:22.186 --> 01:22:24.046
Pitty hot.

898
01:22:52.005 --> 01:22:55.433
<i>There is no civility, only politics.</i>

899
01:22:56.318 --> 01:22:59.997
<i>The Republic is not what it once was.</i>

900
01:23:00.405 --> 01:23:05.451
The senate is full of greedy,
squabbling delegates.

901
01:23:06.232 --> 01:23:09.561
There is no interest in the common good.

902
01:23:10.699 --> 01:23:12.309
I must be frank, Your Majesty.

903
01:23:12.368 --> 01:23:15.148
There is little chance the senate
will act on the invasion.

904
01:23:15.299 --> 01:23:18.099
Chancellor Valorum
seems to think there is hope.

905
01:23:18.270 --> 01:23:22.396
If I may say so, Your Majesty,
the chancellor has little real power.

906
01:23:22.465 --> 01:23:26.471
He is mired by baseless
accusations of corruption.

907
01:23:26.607 --> 01:23:30.452
- The bureaucrats are in charge now.
- What options have we?

908
01:23:31.069 --> 01:23:33.933
Our best choice would be
to push for the election...

909
01:23:34.034 --> 01:23:36.134
...of a stronger supreme chancellor...

910
01:23:36.241 --> 01:23:40.512
...one who could control the bureaucrats
and give us justice.

911
01:23:41.181 --> 01:23:46.870
You could call for a vote of
no confidence in Chancellor Valorum.

912
01:23:47.049 --> 01:23:49.509
He has been our strongest supporter.

913
01:23:49.738 --> 01:23:54.609
Our only other choice would be
to submit a plea to the courts.

914
01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:58.603
The courts take even longer
to decide things than the senate.

915
01:23:59.169 --> 01:24:01.613
<i>Our people are dying, Senator.</i>

916
01:24:01.975 --> 01:24:04.953
We must do something quickly
to stop the Federation.

917
01:24:05.204 --> 01:24:07.800
To be realistic, Your Majesty...

918
01:24:08.001 --> 01:24:10.601
...I think we're going to have to
accept Federation control...

919
01:24:10.810 --> 01:24:12.829
...for the time being.

920
01:24:14.848 --> 01:24:17.142
That is something I cannot do.

921
01:24:24.273 --> 01:24:26.567
He was trained in the Jedi arts.

922
01:24:26.775 --> 01:24:30.671
My only conclusion can be
that it was a Sith lord.

923
01:24:30.779 --> 01:24:32.208
Impossible.

924
01:24:32.309 --> 01:24:34.909
The Sith have been extinct
for a millennium.

925
01:24:35.325 --> 01:24:39.204
<i>I do not believe the Sith could
have returned without us knowing.</i>

926
01:24:40.196 --> 01:24:42.416
Hard to see, the dark side is.

927
01:24:42.833 --> 01:24:45.394
<i>We will use all our resources
to unravel this mystery.</i>

928
01:24:45.622 --> 01:24:48.986
We will discover the identity
of your attacker.

929
01:24:49.230 --> 01:24:50.930
May the Force be with you.

930
01:24:54.661 --> 01:24:56.013
Master Qui-Gon.

931
01:24:56.972 --> 01:24:59.383
<i>More to say have you?</i>

932
01:25:00.851 --> 01:25:02.795
With your permission, my master...

933
01:25:04.380 --> 01:25:07.299
I have encountered a vergence
in the Force.

934
01:25:08.442 --> 01:25:10.502
A vergence, you say.

935
01:25:10.611 --> 01:25:12.771
Located around a person?

936
01:25:12.879 --> 01:25:14.323
A boy.

937
01:25:14.471 --> 01:25:18.675
His cells have the highest concentration
of midi-chlorians I have seen in a life-form.

938
01:25:18.804 --> 01:25:21.898
It is possible he was conceived
by the midi-chlorians.

939
01:25:23.499 --> 01:25:27.169
<i>You refer to the prophecy of the one
who will bring balance to the Force.</i>

940
01:25:28.145 --> 01:25:30.163
You believe it's this boy?

941
01:25:30.441 --> 01:25:33.260
- I don't presume to...
- But you do.

942
01:25:33.550 --> 01:25:35.444
Revealed your opinion is.

943
01:25:35.719 --> 01:25:37.679
I request the boy be tested, Master.

944
01:25:39.821 --> 01:25:43.116
Trained as a Jedi
you request for him, hmm?

945
01:25:43.435 --> 01:25:47.881
Finding him was the will of the Force.
I have no doubt of that.

946
01:25:54.738 --> 01:25:56.615
Bring him before us, then.

947
01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:09.492
The boy's here to see Padmé.

948
01:26:09.605 --> 01:26:11.205
<i>Let him in.</i>

949
01:26:14.733 --> 01:26:17.594
I'm sorry, Ani, but Padmé's
not here right now.

950
01:26:18.687 --> 01:26:20.138
<i>Who is it?</i>

951
01:26:20.473 --> 01:26:24.168
<i>Anakin Skywalker to see
Padmé, Your Highness.</i>

952
01:26:24.276 --> 01:26:27.955
- I've sent Padmé on an errand.
- I'm on my way to the Jedi temple...

953
01:26:28.063 --> 01:26:31.158
...to start my training, I hope.

954
01:26:31.317 --> 01:26:34.995
I may never see her again,
so I came to say good-bye.

955
01:26:36.087 --> 01:26:39.808
We will tell her for you.
We are sure her heart goes with you.

956
01:26:40.784 --> 01:26:42.202
Thank you, Your Highness.

957
01:26:55.994 --> 01:27:00.415
<i>The chair recognizes the senator
from the sovereign system of Naboo.</i>

958
01:27:07.027 --> 01:27:10.330
<i>Supreme Chancellor,
delegates of the senate.</i>

959
01:27:11.523 --> 01:27:13.567
A tragedy has occurred...

960
01:27:13.775 --> 01:27:17.196
...which started right here
with the taxation of trade routes...

961
01:27:17.644 --> 01:27:22.849
...and has now engulfed our entire planet
in the oppression of the Trade Federation.

962
01:27:23.452 --> 01:27:24.931
This is outrageous!

963
01:27:25.185 --> 01:27:27.685
I object to the senator's statements.

964
01:27:27.815 --> 01:27:31.752
The chair does not recognize the senator
from the Trade Federation at this time.

965
01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:35.689
To state our allegations,
I present Queen Amidala...

966
01:27:35.798 --> 01:27:40.461
...recently elected ruler of the Naboo,
who speaks on our behalf.

967
01:27:45.982 --> 01:27:48.810
Honorable representatives
of the Republic.

968
01:27:49.328 --> 01:27:51.982
I come to you under the gravest
of circumstances.

969
01:27:52.090 --> 01:27:54.994
The Naboo system has been invaded
by the droid armies of the Trade...

970
01:27:55.045 --> 01:27:58.445
<i>I object!
There is no proof!</i>

971
01:27:58.862 --> 01:28:00.681
This is incredible.

972
01:28:00.889 --> 01:28:04.743
We recommend a commission be sent
to Naboo to ascertain the truth.

973
01:28:04.836 --> 01:28:06.190
The Congress of Malastare...

974
01:28:06.291 --> 01:28:09.191
...concurs with the honorable delegate
from the Trade Federation.

975
01:28:09.328 --> 01:28:11.257
A commission must be appointed.

976
01:28:11.458 --> 01:28:13.958
- The point...
- Excuse me, Chancellor.

977
01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:15.730
<i>Enter the bureaucrat.</i>

978
01:28:15.904 --> 01:28:18.425
The true rulers of the Republic.

979
01:28:18.555 --> 01:28:22.624
And on the payroll
of the Trade Federation, I might add.

980
01:28:22.803 --> 01:28:27.482
This is where Chancellor Valorum's
strength will disappear.

981
01:28:28.755 --> 01:28:30.983
<i>The point is conceded.</i>

982
01:28:31.305 --> 01:28:36.635
Will you defer your motion to allow a commission
to explore the validity of your accusations?

983
01:28:36.975 --> 01:28:38.575
I will not defer.

984
01:28:38.651 --> 01:28:42.105
I've come before you to resolve
this attack on our sovereignty now.

985
01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:45.722
<i>I was not elected to watch
my people suffer and die...</i>

986
01:28:45.742 --> 01:28:49.222
<i>...while you discuss this invasion
in a committee.</i>

987
01:28:51.123 --> 01:28:55.761
If this body is not capable of action
I suggest new leadership is needed.

988
01:28:58.955 --> 01:29:03.610
I move for a vote of no confidence
in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.

989
01:29:16.331 --> 01:29:17.966
Order!

990
01:29:18.442 --> 01:29:23.330
Now they will elect a new chancellor...
a strong chancellor.

991
01:29:23.438 --> 01:29:26.483
One who will not let
our tragedy continue.

992
01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:32.400
The boy will not pass the council's
test, Master. He's too old.

993
01:29:32.564 --> 01:29:35.501
Anakin will become a Jedi,
I promise you.

994
01:29:35.709 --> 01:29:38.353
Do not defy the council, Master, not again.

995
01:29:38.654 --> 01:29:41.114
I shall do what I must, Obi-Wan.

996
01:29:43.250 --> 01:29:46.962
If you would just follow the code,
you would be on the council.

997
01:29:47.227 --> 01:29:49.914
They will not go along with you this time.

998
01:29:50.532 --> 01:29:53.803
You still have much to learn,
my young apprentice.

999
01:29:56.547 --> 01:29:57.789
A ship.

1000
01:29:59.566 --> 01:30:01.335
A cup.

1001
01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:03.295
<i>A ship.</i>

1002
01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:05.923
A speeder.

1003
01:30:13.772 --> 01:30:17.559
- How feel you?
- Cold, sir.

1004
01:30:19.353 --> 01:30:21.889
- Afraid are you?
- No, sir.

1005
01:30:22.821 --> 01:30:27.351
- See through you we can.
- Be mindful of your feelings.

1006
01:30:27.519 --> 01:30:30.155
<i>Your thoughts dwell on your mother.</i>

1007
01:30:31.849 --> 01:30:34.201
I miss her.

1008
01:30:34.534 --> 01:30:36.854
Afraid to lose her, I think, mmm?

1009
01:30:37.062 --> 01:30:39.189
What has that got to do with anything?

1010
01:30:39.398 --> 01:30:41.524
Everything.

1011
01:30:42.092 --> 01:30:45.054
Fear is the path to the dark side.

1012
01:30:45.212 --> 01:30:47.857
Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate.

1013
01:30:47.916 --> 01:30:51.243
Hate leads to suffering.

1014
01:30:57.933 --> 01:31:00.961
I sense much fear in you.

1015
01:31:14.073 --> 01:31:17.210
Yousa tinking yousa people ganna die?

1016
01:31:17.344 --> 01:31:18.779
I don't know.

1017
01:31:19.688 --> 01:31:22.157
Gungans get pasted too, eh?

1018
01:31:24.306 --> 01:31:26.183
I hope not.

1019
01:31:26.920 --> 01:31:31.234
Gungans no die'n without a fight.
Wesa warriors.

1020
01:31:31.342 --> 01:31:34.386
Wesa got a grand army.

1021
01:31:34.937 --> 01:31:38.023
<i>Dat's why you no liken us,
mesa tinks.</i>

1022
01:31:38.282 --> 01:31:40.284
<i>Your Highness?</i>

1023
01:31:42.151 --> 01:31:44.119
Your Highness...

1024
01:31:44.438 --> 01:31:48.792
Senator Palpatine has been nominated
to succeed Valorum as supreme chancellor.

1025
01:31:48.973 --> 01:31:52.918
A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one.

1026
01:31:53.096 --> 01:31:57.576
Your Majesty, if I am elected,
I promise to put an end to corruption.

1027
01:31:57.754 --> 01:31:59.214
Who else has been nominated?

1028
01:31:59.353 --> 01:32:03.498
Bail Antilles of Alderaan
and Ainlee Teem of Malastare.

1029
01:32:03.882 --> 01:32:08.653
I feel confident our situation will
create a strong sympathy vote for us.

1030
01:32:10.513 --> 01:32:12.406
I will be chancellor.

1031
01:32:12.533 --> 01:32:15.377
I fear by the time you have control
of the bureaucrats, Senator...

1032
01:32:15.460 --> 01:32:18.546
<i>...there'll be nothing left
of our people, our way of life.</i>

1033
01:32:18.722 --> 01:32:20.657
I understand your concern,
Your Majesty.

1034
01:32:20.766 --> 01:32:24.086
Unfortunately, the Federation
has possession of our planet.

1035
01:32:26.118 --> 01:32:27.619
Senator...

1036
01:32:27.978 --> 01:32:29.982
...this is your arena.

1037
01:32:30.333 --> 01:32:32.333
I feel I must return to mine.

1038
01:32:35.380 --> 01:32:37.566
I've decided to go back to Naboo.

1039
01:32:37.657 --> 01:32:38.657
Go back?

1040
01:32:38.724 --> 01:32:41.920
But, Your Majesty, be realistic.
They'll force you to sign the treaty.

1041
01:32:42.104 --> 01:32:44.298
I will sign no treaty, Senator.

1042
01:32:44.456 --> 01:32:47.193
My fate will be no different
than that of our people.

1043
01:32:47.330 --> 01:32:48.830
- Captain.
- Your Highness.

1044
01:32:48.930 --> 01:32:51.250
- Ready my ship.
- Please, Your Majesty.

1045
01:32:51.322 --> 01:32:54.175
Stay here where it's safe.

1046
01:32:54.893 --> 01:32:57.963
It is clear to me now that
the Republic no longer functions.

1047
01:32:58.626 --> 01:33:03.097
<i>I pray you will bring sanity
and compassion back to the senate.</i>

1048
01:33:12.613 --> 01:33:15.184
The Force is strong with him.

1049
01:33:15.265 --> 01:33:17.165
He is to be trained, then?

1050
01:33:19.183 --> 01:33:21.518
No, he will not be trained.

1051
01:33:22.002 --> 01:33:23.353
No?

1052
01:33:25.547 --> 01:33:27.441
He is too old.

1053
01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:31.420
He is the chosen one.
You must see it.

1054
01:33:32.723 --> 01:33:36.234
Clouded this boy's future is.

1055
01:33:38.744 --> 01:33:40.621
I will train him, then.

1056
01:33:44.458 --> 01:33:47.093
I take Anakin as my Padawan learner.

1057
01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:52.896
An apprentice you have, Qui-Gon.
Impossible to take on a second.

1058
01:33:52.966 --> 01:33:54.635
The code forbids it.

1059
01:33:54.943 --> 01:33:58.138
- Obi-Wan is ready.
- I am ready to face the trials.

1060
01:33:58.564 --> 01:34:01.992
Our own counsel we will
keep on who is ready.

1061
01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:07.314
He is headstrong and he has much
to learn of the living Force, but he is capable.

1062
01:34:07.523 --> 01:34:10.192
There is little more
he can learn from me.

1063
01:34:12.136 --> 01:34:15.864
<i>Young Skywalker's fate
will be decided later.</i>

1064
01:34:16.205 --> 01:34:18.682
Now is not the time for this.

1065
01:34:19.343 --> 01:34:21.414
<i>The senate is voting
for a new supreme chancellor...</i>

1066
01:34:21.515 --> 01:34:23.915
<i>...and Queen Amidala is returning home...</i>

1067
01:34:23.989 --> 01:34:27.634
...which puts pressure on the Federation
and could widen the confrontation.

1068
01:34:27.660 --> 01:34:30.078
And draw out the queen's attacker.

1069
01:34:30.250 --> 01:34:34.838
<i>Go with the queen to Naboo and discover
the identity of this dark warrior.</i>

1070
01:34:35.868 --> 01:34:39.863
This is the clue we need
to unravel the mystery of the Sith.

1071
01:34:40.614 --> 01:34:42.908
May the Force be with you.

1072
01:34:56.421 --> 01:34:58.999
It's not disrespect, Master.
It's the truth.

1073
01:34:59.138 --> 01:35:00.909
From your point of view.

1074
01:35:00.987 --> 01:35:04.408
The boy is dangerous.
They all sense it. Why can't you?

1075
01:35:04.509 --> 01:35:07.609
His fate is uncertain.
He's not dangerous.

1076
01:35:07.716 --> 01:35:09.961
The council will decide Anakin's future.

1077
01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:13.531
That should be enough for you.
Now get on board.

1078
01:35:18.660 --> 01:35:22.397
Qui-Gon, sir,
I don't want to be a problem.

1079
01:35:22.603 --> 01:35:24.396
You won't be, Ani.

1080
01:35:24.933 --> 01:35:29.162
I'm not allowed to train you,
so I want you to watch me and be mindful.

1081
01:35:29.463 --> 01:35:31.193
Always remember:

1082
01:35:32.194 --> 01:35:34.694
Your focus determines your reality.

1083
01:35:35.082 --> 01:35:38.410
Stay close to me and you'll be safe.

1084
01:35:38.689 --> 01:35:40.107
Master, sir...

1085
01:35:40.374 --> 01:35:43.719
I heard Yoda talking about midi-chlorians.

1086
01:35:43.847 --> 01:35:47.492
I've been wondering...
What are midi-chlorians?

1087
01:35:48.615 --> 01:35:53.853
Midi-chlorians are a microscopic life-form
that resides within all living cells.

1088
01:35:54.928 --> 01:35:57.789
- They live inside me?
- Inside your cells, yes.

1089
01:35:57.990 --> 01:36:01.352
- And we are symbionts with them.
- Symbionts?

1090
01:36:01.478 --> 01:36:05.399
Life-forms living together
for mutual advantage.

1091
01:36:05.499 --> 01:36:08.270
Without the midi-chlorians,
life could not exist...

1092
01:36:08.371 --> 01:36:11.271
...and we would have no
knowledge of the Force.

1093
01:36:11.421 --> 01:36:13.148
They continually speak to us...

1094
01:36:13.233 --> 01:36:15.978
...telling us the will of the Force.

1095
01:36:16.376 --> 01:36:20.555
When you learn to quiet your mind,
you'll hear them speaking to you.

1096
01:36:20.714 --> 01:36:22.349
I don't understand.

1097
01:36:22.703 --> 01:36:26.264
With time and training, Ani,
you will. You will.

1098
01:36:29.823 --> 01:36:33.760
Your Majesty, it is our pleasure
to continue to serve and protect you.

1099
01:36:34.311 --> 01:36:35.620
I welcome your help.

1100
01:36:35.829 --> 01:36:39.575
Senator Palpatine fears that
the Federation means to destroy me.

1101
01:36:39.883 --> 01:36:42.594
I assure you I will not
allow that to happen.

1102
01:36:43.150 --> 01:36:45.794
Wesa goin' home!

1103
01:36:45.914 --> 01:36:47.791
Come on, R2.

1104
01:36:57.834 --> 01:37:00.279
<i>Is the planet secure?</i>

1105
01:37:00.471 --> 01:37:04.391
We have taken over the last pockets
of primitive life-forms.

1106
01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:07.511
We are in complete control
of the planet now.

1107
01:37:07.619 --> 01:37:13.441
<i>Good. I will see to it that in the senate
things stay as they are.</i>

1108
01:37:14.092 --> 01:37:17.579
<i>I am sending my apprentice,
Darth Maul, to join you.</i>

1109
01:37:17.738 --> 01:37:19.492
Yes, my lord.

1110
01:37:19.593 --> 01:37:21.493
A Sith here?

1111
01:37:27.030 --> 01:37:29.366
Those are the forward stabilizers.

1112
01:37:29.838 --> 01:37:32.558
And those two control the pitch?

1113
01:37:33.670 --> 01:37:35.355
You catch on pretty quick.

1114
01:37:35.856 --> 01:37:37.156
<i>As soon as we land...</i>

1115
01:37:37.223 --> 01:37:40.135
<i>...the Federation will arrest you
and force you to sign the treaty.</i>

1116
01:37:40.236 --> 01:37:41.436
<i>I agree.</i>

1117
01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:43.964
I'm not sure what you wish
to accomplish by this.

1118
01:37:44.498 --> 01:37:46.959
I will take back what's ours.

1119
01:37:47.437 --> 01:37:49.506
<i>There are too few of us,
Your Highness.</i>

1120
01:37:49.645 --> 01:37:51.565
We have no army.

1121
01:37:51.666 --> 01:37:53.266
<i>And I can only protect you.</i>

1122
01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:55.352
I can't fight a war for you.

1123
01:37:56.203 --> 01:37:57.503
Jar Jar Binks.

1124
01:37:58.311 --> 01:38:00.347
Mesa, Your Highness?

1125
01:38:00.764 --> 01:38:03.567
Yes. I need your help.

1126
01:38:08.876 --> 01:38:10.969
I have one battleship on my scope.

1127
01:38:11.405 --> 01:38:13.226
<i>It's a droid control ship.</i>

1128
01:38:13.295 --> 01:38:15.395
<i>They've probably spotted us.</i>

1129
01:38:15.562 --> 01:38:17.189
We haven't much time.

1130
01:38:28.981 --> 01:38:31.768
Jar Jar is on his way
to the Gungan city, Master.

1131
01:38:31.889 --> 01:38:33.189
Good.

1132
01:38:33.247 --> 01:38:35.467
Do you think the queen's idea will work?

1133
01:38:35.618 --> 01:38:37.418
The Gungans will not be easily swayed.

1134
01:38:39.339 --> 01:38:42.326
And we cannot use our power
to help her.

1135
01:38:44.963 --> 01:38:46.818
I'm sorry for my behavior, Master.

1136
01:38:46.859 --> 01:38:50.259
It's not my place to disagree
with you about the boy.

1137
01:38:52.499 --> 01:38:56.028
And I am grateful you think
I'm ready to take the trials.

1138
01:38:56.837 --> 01:38:59.039
You've been a good apprentice, Obi-Wan.

1139
01:39:00.157 --> 01:39:02.851
And you're a much wiser man
than I am.

1140
01:39:03.485 --> 01:39:06.580
I foresee you will become
a great Jedi knight.

1141
01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:22.091
Desa nobody dare!

1142
01:39:22.237 --> 01:39:24.365
The Gungan city is deserted!

1143
01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:27.054
<i>Some kinda fight, mesa tinks.</i>

1144
01:39:27.376 --> 01:39:30.354
Do you think they have been taken
to the camps?

1145
01:39:30.512 --> 01:39:32.689
More likely they were wiped out.

1146
01:39:32.831 --> 01:39:35.876
- Mesa no tink so.
- Do you know where they are, Jar Jar?

1147
01:39:36.327 --> 01:39:39.671
When in trouble,
Gungans go to sacred place.

1148
01:39:39.797 --> 01:39:42.817
Mesa show you. Come on.
Mesa show you!

1149
01:40:00.921 --> 01:40:04.992
Your Honor,
Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1150
01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:14.431
Heyo dadee Big Boss Nass, Your Honor.

1151
01:40:15.349 --> 01:40:17.426
Jar Jar Binks.

1152
01:40:18.419 --> 01:40:21.422
Who's da uss-en uthers?

1153
01:40:22.351 --> 01:40:24.594
I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1154
01:40:25.300 --> 01:40:27.620
I come before you in peace.

1155
01:40:28.711 --> 01:40:30.422
<i>Naboo biggen.</i>

1156
01:40:31.129 --> 01:40:33.866
Yousa bringen da Mackineeks.

1157
01:40:34.034 --> 01:40:37.437
Yousa all bombad.

1158
01:40:38.564 --> 01:40:41.459
<i>We have searched you out
because we wish to form an alliance.</i>

1159
01:40:41.510 --> 01:40:42.910
Your Honor.

1160
01:40:45.279 --> 01:40:47.714
Whosa dis?

1161
01:40:48.365 --> 01:40:50.609
I am Queen Amidala.

1162
01:40:51.994 --> 01:40:57.657
This is my decoy,
my protection, my loyal bodyguard.

1163
01:40:57.753 --> 01:41:01.965
<i>I'm sorry for my deception,
but it was necessary to protect myself.</i>

1164
01:41:02.100 --> 01:41:04.544
<i>Although we do not always agree,
Your Honor...</i>

1165
01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:07.734
...our two great societies
have always lived in peace.

1166
01:41:08.724 --> 01:41:12.210
The Trade Federation has destroyed all
that we have worked so hard to build.

1167
01:41:12.391 --> 01:41:15.502
<i>If we do not act quickly,
all will be lost forever.</i>

1168
01:41:15.609 --> 01:41:17.863
I ask you to help us.

1169
01:41:18.004 --> 01:41:20.604
No, I beg you to help us.

1170
01:41:20.814 --> 01:41:23.451
<i>We are your humble servants.</i>

1171
01:41:26.411 --> 01:41:29.231
Our fate is in your hands.

1172
01:41:46.298 --> 01:41:50.986
Yousa no tinken yousa
greater den da Gungans?

1173
01:41:53.572 --> 01:41:56.717
Mesa lika dis!

1174
01:41:58.176 --> 01:42:03.823
Maybe... wesa...
being friends.

1175
01:42:12.299 --> 01:42:14.134
We've sent our patrols.

1176
01:42:14.927 --> 01:42:19.932
We already located their starship
in the swamp. It won't be long, my lord.

1177
01:42:20.561 --> 01:42:25.332
<i>This is an unexpected move for her.
It's too aggressive.</i>

1178
01:42:25.671 --> 01:42:28.348
<i>Lord Maul, be mindful.</i>

1179
01:42:28.536 --> 01:42:30.648
<i>Let them make the first move.</i>

1180
01:42:30.802 --> 01:42:32.802
Yes, my master.

1181
01:42:36.450 --> 01:42:37.859
Deysa comin!

1182
01:42:42.924 --> 01:42:44.468
They're here!

1183
01:42:44.826 --> 01:42:46.277
Good. They made it.

1184
01:42:50.830 --> 01:42:53.453
Yousa doen grand.

1185
01:42:53.554 --> 01:42:56.654
Jar Jar bring uss-en and da Naboo together.

1186
01:42:56.755 --> 01:42:58.655
Oh, no, no, no.

1187
01:42:58.804 --> 01:43:04.225
So, wesa make you...
bombad general.

1188
01:43:04.425 --> 01:43:05.968
General?

1189
01:43:08.865 --> 01:43:10.365
<i>Captain.</i>

1190
01:43:10.466 --> 01:43:12.968
- Your Highness.
- What is the situation?

1191
01:43:13.110 --> 01:43:14.997
Almost everyone's in camps.

1192
01:43:15.056 --> 01:43:18.484
A few hundred police and guards have formed
an underground resistance movement.

1193
01:43:18.605 --> 01:43:21.105
I brought back as many
of the leaders as I could.

1194
01:43:21.364 --> 01:43:26.185
The Federation army's also much larger
than we thought and much stronger.

1195
01:43:27.232 --> 01:43:30.284
Your Highness, this is a battle
I do not think that we can win.

1196
01:43:30.602 --> 01:43:32.702
The battle is a diversion.

1197
01:43:32.755 --> 01:43:35.527
The Gungans must draw the droid army
away from the cities.

1198
01:43:35.885 --> 01:43:37.169
<i>R2.</i>

1199
01:43:38.251 --> 01:43:41.763
We can enter the city using the secret
passages on the waterfall side.

1200
01:43:42.164 --> 01:43:43.664
<i>Once we get to the main entrance...</i>

1201
01:43:43.802 --> 01:43:46.671
<i>...Captain Panaka will create a diversion.</i>

1202
01:43:46.785 --> 01:43:49.905
<i>Then we can enter the palace
and capture the viceroy.</i>

1203
01:43:50.664 --> 01:43:53.452
Without the viceroy,
they will be lost and confused.

1204
01:43:53.943 --> 01:43:55.543
What do you think, Master Jedi?

1205
01:43:55.602 --> 01:43:57.479
The viceroy will be well-guarded.

1206
01:43:57.712 --> 01:44:00.209
The difficulty is getting
into the throne room.

1207
01:44:00.350 --> 01:44:02.750
Once we're inside,
we shouldn't have a problem.

1208
01:44:02.990 --> 01:44:07.428
There is a possibility, with this
diversion, many Gungans will be killed.

1209
01:44:07.581 --> 01:44:10.751
Wesa ready to do our-san part.

1210
01:44:10.934 --> 01:44:14.129
<i>We have a plan which should
immobilize the droid army.</i>

1211
01:44:14.484 --> 01:44:16.347
We will send what pilots we have...

1212
01:44:16.398 --> 01:44:19.298
...to knock out the droid control ship
orbiting the planet.

1213
01:44:19.401 --> 01:44:22.529
A well-conceived plan.
However, there's great risk.

1214
01:44:22.587 --> 01:44:25.550
<i>The weapons on your fighters
may not penetrate the shields.</i>

1215
01:44:25.751 --> 01:44:27.551
<i>There's an even bigger danger.</i>

1216
01:44:27.661 --> 01:44:31.932
If the viceroy escapes, Your Highness,
he will return with another droid army.

1217
01:44:32.030 --> 01:44:35.150
Well, that is why we must not fail
to get the viceroy.

1218
01:44:35.452 --> 01:44:37.604
Everything depends on it.

1219
01:44:42.571 --> 01:44:45.265
<i>She is more foolish than I thought.</i>

1220
01:44:45.293 --> 01:44:50.073
We are sending all troops to meet
this army assembling near the swamp.

1221
01:44:50.240 --> 01:44:53.001
It appears to be made up of primitives.

1222
01:44:53.555 --> 01:44:55.824
<i>This will work to our advantage.</i>

1223
01:44:55.884 --> 01:44:58.928
I have your approval
to proceed, then, my lord?

1224
01:44:59.512 --> 01:45:01.514
<i>Wipe them out.</i>

1225
01:45:02.965 --> 01:45:04.826
<i>All of them.</i>

1226
01:45:40.500 --> 01:45:42.869
Starting up the shield.

1227
01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:13.440
Open fire.

1228
01:46:29.456 --> 01:46:32.743
Once we get inside, you find
a safe place to hide and stay there.

1229
01:46:33.010 --> 01:46:35.479
- Sure.
- Stay there.

1230
01:47:01.180 --> 01:47:04.158
I thought the battle was going
to take place far from here.

1231
01:47:04.991 --> 01:47:06.535
This is too close.

1232
01:47:12.515 --> 01:47:14.284
Ani, find cover.

1233
01:47:15.085 --> 01:47:17.537
- Quick!
- Get to your ships!

1234
01:48:15.946 --> 01:48:17.130
Fighters straight ahead.

1235
01:48:17.341 --> 01:48:18.542
Roger, Bravo Leader.

1236
01:48:18.642 --> 01:48:19.910
Roger, Bravo Leader.

1237
01:48:28.529 --> 01:48:29.664
Cease fire.

1238
01:48:37.447 --> 01:48:39.891
Steady. Steady.

1239
01:49:12.727 --> 01:49:15.772
- Activate the droids.
- Yes, sir.

1240
01:49:32.494 --> 01:49:34.187
Ouch time.

1241
01:49:48.526 --> 01:49:49.769
Fire!

1242
01:50:11.745 --> 01:50:13.538
My guess is the viceroy's
in the throne room.

1243
01:50:13.647 --> 01:50:16.858
<i>Red group! Blue group!
Everybody, this way!</i>

1244
01:50:17.621 --> 01:50:19.325
Hey, wait for me!

1245
01:50:19.456 --> 01:50:21.756
Anakin, stay where you are.
You'll be safe there.

1246
01:50:21.897 --> 01:50:24.500
- But I...
- Stay in that cockpit.

1247
01:50:35.919 --> 01:50:39.547
- We'll handle this.
- We'll take the long way.

1248
01:50:59.460 --> 01:51:01.679
We gotta do something, R2.

1249
01:51:24.176 --> 01:51:26.928
I'm trying to!
I don't know where the trigger is!

1250
01:51:31.565 --> 01:51:33.892
Wrong one.
Maybe it's this one.

1251
01:51:34.771 --> 01:51:37.196
Nope. Wait. Here it is.

1252
01:51:45.679 --> 01:51:47.197
Let's go!

1253
01:51:48.610 --> 01:51:50.737
It's on automatic pilot.

1254
01:51:59.665 --> 01:52:01.650
Try to override it.

1255
01:53:01.531 --> 01:53:03.416
We don't have time for this, Captain.

1256
01:53:09.760 --> 01:53:11.570
Look, there they are.

1257
01:53:11.610 --> 01:53:14.079
<i>That's where the autopilot's taking us.</i>

1258
01:53:31.025 --> 01:53:33.625
Dumb droid. Take that!

1259
01:53:33.666 --> 01:53:35.866
Get off! Get off! Get off!

1260
01:53:47.050 --> 01:53:49.561
The deflector shield is too strong.

1261
01:53:58.622 --> 01:54:00.348
This is tense!

1262
01:54:02.665 --> 01:54:06.686
R2, get us off this autopilot.
It's gonna get us both killed.

1263
01:54:08.699 --> 01:54:10.208
<i>You did it, R2!</i>

1264
01:54:10.959 --> 01:54:12.402
OK, let's go left.

1265
01:54:17.370 --> 01:54:18.555
<i>Go back?</i>

1266
01:54:18.635 --> 01:54:22.848
Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit,
so that's what I'm gonna do.

1267
01:54:29.875 --> 01:54:32.310
I'll try spinning.
That's a good trick.

1268
01:54:37.780 --> 01:54:40.283
I know we're in trouble.
Just hang on.

1269
01:54:53.375 --> 01:54:54.918
Ascension guns!

1270
01:57:01.110 --> 01:57:02.995
Retreat! Retreat!

1271
01:57:04.519 --> 01:57:05.970
Dis is nutsen.

1272
01:57:17.050 --> 01:57:18.301
Big boomers.

1273
01:57:38.902 --> 01:57:40.502
Give me a lift!

1274
01:57:48.462 --> 01:57:52.082
- Jar Jar, usen da booma!
- What? Mesa no have a booma!

1275
01:57:52.222 --> 01:57:54.232
Here. Taken dis one.

1276
01:58:10.668 --> 01:58:11.868
Jar Jar!

1277
01:58:12.009 --> 01:58:14.427
Jump, Jar Jar, jump!

1278
01:58:24.070 --> 01:58:26.831
Put down your weapons.
They win this round.

1279
01:58:39.578 --> 01:58:41.671
We're hit, R2!

1280
01:58:54.960 --> 01:58:57.787
I'm trying to stop! I'm trying to stop!

1281
01:59:05.162 --> 01:59:07.306
Everything's overheated.

1282
01:59:08.798 --> 01:59:10.232
This is not good.

1283
02:00:22.706 --> 02:00:27.143
No giben up, General Jar Jar.
Mesa think of something.

1284
02:00:27.380 --> 02:00:28.531
Hands up.

1285
02:00:28.590 --> 02:00:31.343
My give up. My give up.

1286
02:00:39.990 --> 02:00:43.135
Your little insurrection
is at an end, Your Highness.

1287
02:00:43.193 --> 02:00:47.214
<i>Time for you to sign the treaty
and end this pointless debate in the senate.</i>

1288
02:00:47.315 --> 02:00:48.915
<i>Viceroy!</i>

1289
02:00:49.124 --> 02:00:51.143
Your occupation here has ended.

1290
02:00:52.703 --> 02:00:56.214
After her.
This one's a decoy.

1291
02:01:02.546 --> 02:01:04.089
<i>Captain!</i>

1292
02:01:13.415 --> 02:01:15.291
Jam the doors.

1293
02:01:18.900 --> 02:01:21.736
Now, Viceroy,
we will discuss a new treaty.

1294
02:02:24.950 --> 02:02:27.569
Yes! We have power.
Shields up.

1295
02:02:30.642 --> 02:02:31.927
Take this!

1296
02:02:33.779 --> 02:02:35.063
And this!

1297
02:02:43.531 --> 02:02:44.531
We're losing power.

1298
02:02:44.602 --> 02:02:46.555
There seems to be a problem
with the main reactor.

1299
02:02:46.596 --> 02:02:47.896
<i>Impossible!</i>

1300
02:02:48.153 --> 02:02:50.040
Nothing can get through our shield.

1301
02:02:51.323 --> 02:02:52.999
Let's get outta here.

1302
02:03:01.331 --> 02:03:04.159
What's that?
It's blowing up from the inside!

1303
02:03:07.220 --> 02:03:08.446
We didn't hit it.

1304
02:03:11.381 --> 02:03:13.641
Now, this is Podracing.

1305
02:03:15.020 --> 02:03:16.730
Look, one of ours,
out of the main hold!

1306
02:03:40.362 --> 02:03:41.922
Was'n they doing?

1307
02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:45.684
The control ship
has been destroyed. Look!

1308
02:03:47.619 --> 02:03:49.596
They all broke-ed.

1309
02:04:39.096 --> 02:04:41.557
No, it's too late.

1310
02:04:41.836 --> 02:04:44.205
- No.
- Obi-Wan.

1311
02:04:45.516 --> 02:04:47.116
Promise...

1312
02:04:47.579 --> 02:04:49.849
Promise me...
you will train the boy.

1313
02:04:50.085 --> 02:04:51.511
Yes, Master.

1314
02:04:55.570 --> 02:04:58.081
He... is the chosen one.

1315
02:04:58.420 --> 02:05:01.648
He... will bring balance.

1316
02:05:02.995 --> 02:05:04.489
Train him.

1317
02:05:31.702 --> 02:05:33.470
Now, Viceroy...

1318
02:05:33.764 --> 02:05:37.042
<i>...you're going to have to go back
to the senate and explain all this.</i>

1319
02:05:38.900 --> 02:05:42.169
I think you can kiss
your trade franchise good-bye.

1320
02:05:56.011 --> 02:05:59.381
We are indebted to you
for your bravery, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

1321
02:05:59.600 --> 02:06:01.859
And you, young Skywalker.

1322
02:06:02.191 --> 02:06:05.212
We will watch your career
with great interest.

1323
02:06:12.014 --> 02:06:14.491
Congratulations on your
election, Chancellor.

1324
02:06:15.130 --> 02:06:19.916
Your boldness has saved our people, Your Majesty.
It's you who should be congratulated.

1325
02:06:19.956 --> 02:06:24.609
Together we shall bring peace
and prosperity to the Republic.

1326
02:06:29.600 --> 02:06:34.304
Confer on you the level
of Jedi knight the council does.

1327
02:06:34.595 --> 02:06:38.991
But agree with your taking this boy
as your Padawan learner...

1328
02:06:39.091 --> 02:06:40.869
...I do not.

1329
02:06:41.120 --> 02:06:43.020
Qui-Gon believed in him.

1330
02:06:46.106 --> 02:06:48.709
The chosen one the boy may be.

1331
02:06:48.917 --> 02:06:50.413
Nevertheless...

1332
02:06:50.514 --> 02:06:53.714
...grave danger I fear in his training.

1333
02:06:53.852 --> 02:06:57.697
Master Yoda,
I gave Qui-Gon my word.

1334
02:06:57.843 --> 02:06:59.970
I will train Anakin.

1335
02:07:01.992 --> 02:07:04.311
Without the approval
of the council, if I must.

1336
02:07:04.449 --> 02:07:09.146
Qui-Gon's defiance I sense in you.
Need that you do not.

1337
02:07:11.394 --> 02:07:14.339
Agree with you the council does.

1338
02:07:15.684 --> 02:07:19.304
Your apprentice Skywalker will be.

1339
02:07:46.683 --> 02:07:48.427
What will happen to me now?

1340
02:07:48.681 --> 02:07:51.737
The council have granted me
permission to train you.

1341
02:07:51.895 --> 02:07:55.195
You will be a Jedi, I promise.

1342
02:08:04.576 --> 02:08:07.996
There's no doubt
the mysterious warrior was a Sith.

1343
02:08:08.155 --> 02:08:10.584
Always two there are.

1344
02:08:10.765 --> 02:08:13.865
No more, no less.

1345
02:08:14.077 --> 02:08:17.055
A master and an apprentice.

1346
02:08:17.184 --> 02:08:21.621
But which was destroyed?
The master or the apprentice?

1347
02:09:35.300 --> 02:09:37.151
Peace!
