1
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.649
Come on, Gus-Gus. Faster!

2
00:00:42.725 --> 00:00:45.295
What's the hurry, Jaq-Jaq?
What's the hurry?

3
00:00:45.372 --> 00:00:48.631
Fairy Godmother's here. She's gonna
read us the Cinderelly story.

4
00:00:49.743 --> 00:00:52.196
Shh. Pom Pom.

5
00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:22.028
Come on, Gus!

6
00:01:23.754 --> 00:01:29.006
" Cinderella and the prince
lived happily ever after.

7
00:01:30.041 --> 00:01:31.959
The end. "

8
00:01:33.876 --> 00:01:36.445
- We missed it?
- Mm-hmm.

9
00:01:36.522 --> 00:01:39.896
- Maybe you could read another one.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Gus...

10
00:01:40.011 --> 00:01:42.810
but that's the only
Cinderella book there is.

11
00:01:42.848 --> 00:01:47.411
Yeah, Gus-Gus. You heard her.
" The end. " That's all.

12
00:01:47.488 --> 00:01:49.942
Uh, maybe we
could make another book.

13
00:01:50.019 --> 00:01:52.664
- We can tell the stories.
- And make the drawings!

14
00:01:52.741 --> 00:01:56.844
- Yeah! Yeah! - Yeah! Yeah!
- Oh, what an excellent idea.

15
00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.407
No, no, wait a minute.
Who'd wanna read a book made by mice?

16
00:02:01.445 --> 00:02:03.400
Cinderella would read it.

17
00:02:03.553 --> 00:02:07.273
And if you made it,
I know that she'd love it.

18
00:02:07.388 --> 00:02:09.382
But we don't know
how to make a book.

19
00:02:09.535 --> 00:02:13.178
Oh, don't worry, dear.
I think I can help.

20
00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:20.578
Salagadoola menchihka boola
Bibbidi bobbidi boo

21
00:02:20.655 --> 00:02:24.259
Put 'em together and what have you got
Bibbidi bobbidi boo

22
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.398
Now, what do we need
A pencil, indeed

23
00:02:41.513 --> 00:02:43.086
- And crayons - And
glitter - And glue

24
00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:47.687
- We'll sew up the book with a thread and a hook
- Bibbidi bobbidi boo

25
00:02:47.764 --> 00:02:51.675
Oh, very nice. Well done, little mice.
But something is missing it's true.

26
00:02:51.751 --> 00:02:53.783
Oh, look there.
The pages are bare.

27
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.120
- We need a story from you.
- Who, us?

28
00:02:57.273 --> 00:02:59.727
No, no, we don't know
any good stories.

29
00:02:59.765 --> 00:03:04.021
Wait, wait!
How's about " First Day In Castle "?

30
00:03:04.175 --> 00:03:07.664
Oh, yeah.
That is a good one.

31
00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:10.579
I'd love to hear all about it.

32
00:03:18.132 --> 00:03:21.238
It was right after Cinderelly
and the prince got married.

33
00:03:21.391 --> 00:03:24.075
Mice-mice move to the big castle.

34
00:03:24.151 --> 00:03:29.098
We had it all to ourselves, and we
were having the time of our lives.

35
00:03:36.728 --> 00:03:38.569
Cinderelly's back!

36
00:03:38.684 --> 00:03:41.329
- Oh, dear, they're back!
- They're back!

37
00:03:44.588 --> 00:03:46.966
- They're back!
- They're back!

38
00:03:53.752 --> 00:03:56.706
- We're back!
- Welcome home.

39
00:03:56.782 --> 00:03:59.504
I still can't believe
I'm going to live in a castle.

40
00:03:59.581 --> 00:04:02.035
Are you sure
this isn't just a dream?

41
00:04:02.188 --> 00:04:03.837
You're a princess now.

42
00:04:05.295 --> 00:04:07.403
Princess Cinderella.

43
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.585
She won't even know the first thing
about being a princess.

44
00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.615
She just got back from her honeymoon.

45
00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.529
It's going to be your duty
to prepare the girl.

46
00:04:16.606 --> 00:04:19.328
Your Majesty, I am honoured.

47
00:04:19.443 --> 00:04:21.974
Not you, ninny. Prudence!

48
00:04:22.051 --> 00:04:26.805
Of course not you. He wants
the job done right the first time.

49
00:04:26.959 --> 00:04:31.100
The royal banquet will be
Cinderella's responsibility now.

50
00:04:31.214 --> 00:04:33.515
The royal banquet?

51
00:04:33.592 --> 00:04:36.160
You'll teach her everything
she needs to know.

52
00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:41.030
But, Sire, she won't know anything
about planning a royal banquet.

53
00:04:41.184 --> 00:04:44.097
I don't know anything about
planning a royal banquet.

54
00:04:44.251 --> 00:04:46.974
Oh, well. At least I can
stay past midnight.

55
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.079
Perfect!
And I'll be right by your side.

56
00:04:50.156 --> 00:04:52.456
I have to go?
Now?

57
00:04:52.533 --> 00:04:55.409
Father, I can't just
abandon my princess!

58
00:04:55.563 --> 00:04:58.361
Not with the royal banquet
only two days away.

59
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.927
Nonsense! We have important
matters of state to attend to.

60
00:05:02.042 --> 00:05:04.152
Important matters of state!

61
00:05:04.305 --> 00:05:05.992
Eh, Father-

62
00:05:06.107 --> 00:05:08.178
She hasn't had time to prepare.

63
00:05:08.216 --> 00:05:10.286
She's never been a princess before.

64
00:05:10.363 --> 00:05:15.693
I dare say, Majesty,
you do like your banquets just so, eh?

65
00:05:15.731 --> 00:05:19.872
- It's a great deal to ask of the poor girl.
- Nonsense!

66
00:05:19.987 --> 00:05:25.202
Your Majesty, I can take care
of the preparations as I always do.

67
00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:27.617
Just show her what to do!

68
00:05:27.732 --> 00:05:31.950
We have a princess now.
It's her duty to plan the banquet.

69
00:05:32.104 --> 00:05:36.820
And the king's duty to endure it.

70
00:05:36.935 --> 00:05:38.738
Yes, Your Majesty.

71
00:05:38.853 --> 00:05:40.769
Now off we go!

72
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.025
- Thank you.
- I'm sorry I have to rush off.

73
00:05:45.102 --> 00:05:47.135
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

74
00:05:47.288 --> 00:05:50.432
I know you're gonna surprise us
with an incredible feast.

75
00:05:50.547 --> 00:05:53.077
I just hope you're not
too surprised.

76
00:06:21.988 --> 00:06:24.098
- Cinderelly! -
Cinderelly! - Cinderelly!

77
00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.351
Jaq! Gus! Mary!
Hello, old friends.

78
00:06:30.922 --> 00:06:33.492
Bruno!

79
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.748
Look-look. Big chair
for Princess Cinderelly!

80
00:06:39.358 --> 00:06:41.928
Oh, my.

81
00:06:43.576 --> 00:06:45.723
Big castle too.

82
00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:49.826
Don't worry, Cinderelly.
Us mice here to help.

83
00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:53.660
Why, thank you, Jaq. We've got
a big day ahead of us tomorrow.

84
00:06:57.725 --> 00:06:59.795
Um, this way, fellas.

85
00:07:20.578 --> 00:07:22.840
Good morning, Your Highness.

86
00:07:25.255 --> 00:07:26.751
Your Highness!

87
00:07:31.275 --> 00:07:34.994
Ready for breakfast?
How does a cheese omelette sound?

88
00:07:36.068 --> 00:07:38.023
The princess is missing!

89
00:07:39.788 --> 00:07:43.238
You! You, girl!
Have you seen the princess?

90
00:07:43.277 --> 00:07:45.156
Good morning, Prudence.

91
00:07:45.233 --> 00:07:49.987
Oh, I thought you-
But those awful clothes!

92
00:07:50.141 --> 00:07:54.090
Well, I- I didn't recognize you,
Your Highness.

93
00:07:54.128 --> 00:07:56.735
Allow me to introduce
your ladies in waiting.

94
00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:59.841
- Beatrice and Daphne.
- Pleased to meet you.

95
00:07:59.994 --> 00:08:01.874
You're just in time for breakfast.

96
00:08:01.989 --> 00:08:05.593
Breakfast? Ooh, with toast and jam?

97
00:08:06.858 --> 00:08:11.306
Your Highness, a princess
never prepares her own meals.

98
00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:15.025
That is not how things are done.

99
00:08:15.102 --> 00:08:17.747
There are rules about breakfast?

100
00:08:17.786 --> 00:08:20.546
Of course there are rules,
Your Highness.

101
00:08:20.585 --> 00:08:22.541
But it's certainly not your fault...

102
00:08:22.617 --> 00:08:24.841
that you don't know
the traditions of the castle.

103
00:08:24.917 --> 00:08:28.561
That's what the king
expects me to teach you.

104
00:08:28.599 --> 00:08:30.938
I'm sure I can learn it in no time.

105
00:08:31.091 --> 00:08:33.698
Mm-hmm. Come along.
There's no time to dally.

106
00:08:33.775 --> 00:08:37.494
Just do as I say,
and everything will be fine.

107
00:08:40.677 --> 00:08:42.901
The king would be horrified...

108
00:08:43.054 --> 00:08:46.927
to find the hostess of the royal banquet
dressed like a scullery maid!

109
00:08:47.962 --> 00:08:51.336
A princess must be attired
like royalty.

110
00:08:52.564 --> 00:08:55.247
Do I have to wear this all the time?

111
00:08:55.286 --> 00:08:57.357
Oh, of course not, Your Highness.

112
00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:59.887
You'll need something
much more formal for dinner.

113
00:09:01.037 --> 00:09:05.102
Couldn't I just wear
one of my own dresses?

114
00:09:05.179 --> 00:09:07.210
Very amusing, Your Highness...

115
00:09:07.325 --> 00:09:09.933
but it simply isn't done.

116
00:09:20.937 --> 00:09:24.273
It's such a beautiful day.
Why don't we open the curtains?

117
00:09:24.311 --> 00:09:29.335
No, no, no!
These curtains are never opened.

118
00:09:29.373 --> 00:09:32.440
And certainly not
by a princess.

119
00:09:32.517 --> 00:09:36.084
It most definitely isn't done.

120
00:09:38.269 --> 00:09:41.298
Dukes and viscounts
sit nearest the king...

121
00:09:41.374 --> 00:09:43.407
unless there is a marquis present.

122
00:09:43.522 --> 00:09:46.436
Wouldn't it be nice if people
could just sit wherever they like?

123
00:09:46.513 --> 00:09:49.236
No. You must never seat a duke...

124
00:09:49.311 --> 00:09:52.418
above a marquis or below a baron.

125
00:09:52.533 --> 00:09:55.101
Which colour is correct,
Your Highness?

126
00:09:55.178 --> 00:09:57.288
Cream or ecru?

127
00:09:57.403 --> 00:09:59.511
Um, e-e-ecru?

128
00:09:59.664 --> 00:10:01.889
Goodness, no. Cream.

129
00:10:01.927 --> 00:10:03.806
But there isn't any difference.

130
00:10:03.921 --> 00:10:06.297
Oh, my. So much to learn.

131
00:10:06.412 --> 00:10:08.292
So little time.

132
00:10:09.557 --> 00:10:12.471
At the banquet, as always...

133
00:10:12.625 --> 00:10:15.807
the royal menu shall consist
of the rarest roast beef...

134
00:10:15.922 --> 00:10:19.603
French onion soup, tarragon mashed
potatoes, freshly baked baguettes...

135
00:10:19.718 --> 00:10:24.166
the finest truffles in the kingdom
and, for dessert...

136
00:10:24.281 --> 00:10:26.697
Norwegian stewed prunes.

137
00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:30.224
Prunes?
For dessert?

138
00:10:30.301 --> 00:10:33.944
The king expects it.
It is a tradition that is never broken.

139
00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:37.049
Besides, I like them.

140
00:10:40.883 --> 00:10:45.024
Your Highness shall pause here
to greet her noble guests.

141
00:10:45.063 --> 00:10:49.050
Remember. Curtsy to royalty,
wave to nobility.

142
00:10:49.089 --> 00:10:51.735
I know I can do this right.

143
00:10:51.773 --> 00:10:54.380
- Cinderella!
- Cinderella! Hi!

144
00:10:54.419 --> 00:10:57.486
My friends! Hello! Hello!

145
00:10:57.563 --> 00:11:01.206
How nice to see you.
Wait just a minute.

146
00:11:01.321 --> 00:11:04.043
- Open the gate!
- No, no, no!

147
00:11:04.082 --> 00:11:08.414
These gates are only opened
for royal visitors.

148
00:11:08.491 --> 00:11:12.172
You must remember the rules.

149
00:11:12.287 --> 00:11:15.278
Commoners are never
allowed in the palace.

150
00:11:15.393 --> 00:11:17.502
It simply isn't done.

151
00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:21.336
Bye-bye!

152
00:11:46.259 --> 00:11:51.551
At the very least, one must learn
to dance with poise and grace.

153
00:11:51.628 --> 00:11:55.999
I'm trying.
I- I-I just need more practise.

154
00:11:57.379 --> 00:12:01.942
It must be perfect.
It is the king's favourite dance.

155
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:12.908
No, no, no, Your Highness.
It must be slower and more formal.

156
00:12:13.023 --> 00:12:15.400
Your Highness, eggshell or bone?

157
00:12:15.554 --> 00:12:17.088
- Eggshell?
- Bone.

158
00:12:17.203 --> 00:12:19.618
Now, who sits next to the count?

159
00:12:19.771 --> 00:12:21.919
- The duke?
- The marquis.

160
00:12:22.033 --> 00:12:23.644
- Gold or silver?
- For what?

161
00:12:23.798 --> 00:12:26.137
- Baron or viscount?
- Who?

162
00:12:26.251 --> 00:12:28.706
- Pekoe or Darjeeling?
- I don't know!

163
00:12:28.744 --> 00:12:32.348
- Braised or broiled? -
Fish or fowl? - Stand or sit?

164
00:12:32.425 --> 00:12:34.763
- Mind the music! - Hair
up or down? - Left or right?

165
00:12:34.878 --> 00:12:37.908
- One or two? - Watch the
chair! - Your Highness!

166
00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:50.101
Your Highness, the dance
is best performed on one's feet.

167
00:13:08.812 --> 00:13:11.267
This is a disaster.

168
00:13:27.601 --> 00:13:30.707
Poor Cinderelly.
Please don't cry.

169
00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:34.963
Cinderelly not happy,
mice-mice not happy.

170
00:13:35.001 --> 00:13:38.069
Jaq, what am I going to do?

171
00:13:38.184 --> 00:13:41.175
I'm a complete failure
as a princess.

172
00:13:45.354 --> 00:13:48.306
Why can't I learn to do this right?

173
00:13:50.416 --> 00:13:52.754
Ah, look at me.

174
00:13:52.869 --> 00:13:54.864
Cinderelly not look like Cinderelly.

175
00:13:55.017 --> 00:13:59.886
It's true.
Something's just not right here.

176
00:14:00.001 --> 00:14:02.417
Like, uh, stewed prunes?

177
00:14:02.532 --> 00:14:06.788
Exactly, Gus. And why do they
have to keep the palace so dark?

178
00:14:06.942 --> 00:14:08.897
And that awful dance.

179
00:14:09.012 --> 00:14:13.114
- And those boring colours that all look the same.
- And stewed prunes!

180
00:14:13.268 --> 00:14:16.872
Especially those rules about
keeping commoners out of the palace!

181
00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:19.518
Why, I was a dish maid when
the prince married me.

182
00:14:19.595 --> 00:14:22.624
And he loves me because I'm me.

183
00:14:22.701 --> 00:14:26.842
I've been trying to obey someone
else's rules about who I should be...

184
00:14:26.918 --> 00:14:29.372
and how I should dress.

185
00:14:32.057 --> 00:14:34.318
This hair!

186
00:14:35.622 --> 00:14:39.342
I know I can do this. I just have
to stop trying to be someone else.

187
00:14:39.495 --> 00:14:41.681
What's she gonna do, Jaq-Jaq?

188
00:14:41.796 --> 00:14:46.588
Gus, I'm going to plan
this banquet my way.

189
00:14:46.665 --> 00:14:50.729
Who's to say the rules
must stay the same forevermore

190
00:14:50.844 --> 00:14:52.877
Open the gates!

191
00:14:52.992 --> 00:14:59.318
Whoever made them had to change
the rules that came before

192
00:14:59.433 --> 00:15:04.456
So make your own way
Show the beauty within

193
00:15:04.533 --> 00:15:11.321
When you follow your heart
there's no heart you can't win

194
00:15:11.397 --> 00:15:13.621
Oh! Why, thank you!

195
00:15:16.189 --> 00:15:18.874
Your Highness,
the king would not approve.

196
00:15:18.951 --> 00:15:22.517
You're supposed to be inviting dukes
and counts and other aristocrats.

197
00:15:22.632 --> 00:15:27.118
- I am inviting them, along with all my friends here in the village.
- Thank you.

198
00:15:27.271 --> 00:15:31.182
Your Highness,
I strongly advise against it.

199
00:15:31.259 --> 00:15:35.323
It's simply not the way
things are done.

200
00:15:36.282 --> 00:15:39.848
Perhaps the time has come
to try something new.

201
00:15:39.925 --> 00:15:44.257
So reach for the sky
It's not high as it seems

202
00:15:44.296 --> 00:15:50.277
Just follow your heart
Go as far as your dreams

203
00:15:50.392 --> 00:15:54.188
This party needs help,
starting with dessert.

204
00:15:54.303 --> 00:15:57.026
No prunes. Yuck!

205
00:15:57.141 --> 00:15:59.709
Jaq-Jaq love chocolate.

206
00:16:05.998 --> 00:16:10.024
Chocolate pudding!
Now that sounds good.

207
00:16:20.645 --> 00:16:23.789
We never get to dance like this.

208
00:16:25.054 --> 00:16:30.461
Dance if you want to
Don't fear you'll fall

209
00:16:32.034 --> 00:16:39.702
Take a chance, 'cause it's better
than never to chance it at all

210
00:16:39.779 --> 00:16:45.223
It simply isn't done.
It simply isn't done!

211
00:16:46.258 --> 00:16:49.326
" It simply isn't done! "

212
00:16:49.364 --> 00:16:54.617
It simply isn't done It simply
isn't done It simply isn't done

213
00:16:57.225 --> 00:17:01.098
There's a world for the changing
and you've just begun

214
00:17:01.175 --> 00:17:04.510
Don't let them tell you
it's simply not done

215
00:17:04.664 --> 00:17:13.291
When you follow your heart
you'll shine bright as the sun

216
00:17:13.444 --> 00:17:17.739
- Your Highness, sand or buff?
- Which colour do you like?

217
00:17:17.854 --> 00:17:19.924
Hmm. Pink!

218
00:17:20.844 --> 00:17:22.647
Perfect.

219
00:17:22.762 --> 00:17:26.941
Hmm. Something's still missing.

220
00:17:30.162 --> 00:17:32.117
Now, that's more like it.

221
00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:37.984
- What will the king say?
- I know this is a big change.

222
00:17:38.061 --> 00:17:40.629
But I have to try this my way.

223
00:17:40.668 --> 00:17:45.729
Well, then, I certainly hope
you know what you're doing.

224
00:17:53.283 --> 00:17:56.121
They're here, Cinderelly!
They're here!

225
00:17:59.686 --> 00:18:02.562
Well, it's too late
to turn back now.

226
00:18:20.123 --> 00:18:22.309
Now, this dance is more like it.

227
00:18:29.863 --> 00:18:32.662
Oh, this dance is horrifying!

228
00:18:57.048 --> 00:18:59.502
The king has arrived.

229
00:19:06.404 --> 00:19:08.360
Pudding!

230
00:19:12.194 --> 00:19:14.954
What in blazes is going on here?

231
00:19:15.031 --> 00:19:18.405
Your Majesty!

232
00:19:18.482 --> 00:19:22.508
- Who opened those curtains?
- This is all Princess Cinderella's doing!

233
00:19:22.585 --> 00:19:25.729
Oh, what a lovely moon.

234
00:19:25.768 --> 00:19:29.986
- I tried to teach her, Sire.
- Commoners in the palace?

235
00:19:30.101 --> 00:19:32.286
She simply refused to listen.

236
00:19:32.401 --> 00:19:35.928
- Oh, hello, Giuseppe!
- It's a scandal!

237
00:19:36.043 --> 00:19:38.613
Your Majesty, I can explain.

238
00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:40.568
What is this?

239
00:19:40.721 --> 00:19:42.601
Your dessert, Sire.

240
00:19:42.677 --> 00:19:45.898
No prunes for dessert?

241
00:19:46.013 --> 00:19:48.198
An absolute outrage!

242
00:19:49.234 --> 00:19:52.608
Mmm, chocolate.
My favourite!

243
00:19:56.442 --> 00:20:00.314
What happened to the music?
Everybody dance!

244
00:20:16.419 --> 00:20:20.369
I always said we needed
some new traditions around here.

245
00:20:20.445 --> 00:20:23.935
Go on, now, Prudence.
You're missing all the fun.

246
00:20:33.291 --> 00:20:35.437
- Did I miss something?
- Surprise!

247
00:20:37.317 --> 00:20:39.540
Splendid job. Splendid!

248
00:20:39.617 --> 00:20:43.911
It is the princess
who deserves your praise, Sire.

249
00:20:43.988 --> 00:20:48.436
And I am honoured to be
at Her Highness's service.

250
00:20:48.513 --> 00:20:51.273
I think we're going
to be great friends.

251
00:21:09.448 --> 00:21:12.592
I told my son
he had chosen well.

252
00:21:12.707 --> 00:21:15.008
You're a natural.

253
00:21:15.046 --> 00:21:18.267
Hooray! Hooray!

254
00:21:18.344 --> 00:21:20.797
Another dance!

255
00:21:20.951 --> 00:21:23.214
I'm glad you do things
your own way.

256
00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:25.744
Someday I'll get
this princess thing right.

257
00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:27.738
I think that day is today.

258
00:21:36.365 --> 00:21:40.967
Well, Cinderella certainly turned
things around, didn't she?

259
00:21:41.005 --> 00:21:42.998
Yeah, no more big hair.

260
00:21:43.113 --> 00:21:45.108
Or prunes.

261
00:21:52.738 --> 00:21:54.540
Can't get it.

262
00:21:54.578 --> 00:21:57.799
Oh, let me help with that.

263
00:21:57.876 --> 00:22:00.330
Whoa!

264
00:22:00.483 --> 00:22:03.090
Watch it.
I don't like that magic stuff.

265
00:22:03.167 --> 00:22:04.931
Remember what
happened last time.

266
00:22:05.084 --> 00:22:08.190
Oh, now there's a story
we should tell.

267
00:22:08.305 --> 00:22:10.184
Yeah, that's a good one!

268
00:22:12.331 --> 00:22:15.591
Oh, no. No, no, no.
Very, very boring story.

269
00:22:15.743 --> 00:22:17.930
We don't want to hear that one.

270
00:22:17.968 --> 00:22:21.879
- But, Jaq, it's my favourite.
- Okay, let's hear it.

271
00:22:21.956 --> 00:22:25.675
Well, it certainly was
an unusual wish, Jaq, dear.

272
00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:30.161
But things didn't turn out
quite the way you had planned.

273
00:22:30.238 --> 00:22:33.535
Duh, what are we doing
in the garden, Jaq-Jaq?

274
00:22:33.612 --> 00:22:36.833
Gus-Gus not had breakfast yet.

275
00:22:36.947 --> 00:22:39.824
Gus-Gus, we're going to pick
flowers for Cinderelly.

276
00:22:39.901 --> 00:22:43.658
- What for?
- Because we never get a chance to do anything for Cinderelly now.

277
00:22:43.735 --> 00:22:45.651
Uh, sure we do.

278
00:22:45.728 --> 00:22:49.333
- Like what?
- Uh, well, uh, duh, uh, let's see.

279
00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:52.017
See?

280
00:22:52.094 --> 00:22:56.503
Oh, Cinderelly don't need mice-mice.
She got lots of people to help her.

281
00:22:56.657 --> 00:22:59.685
Well, I want to bring her
a big bunch of flowers.

282
00:23:22.385 --> 00:23:25.759
- That's enough!
- You've got to think big, Gus-Gus.

283
00:23:27.677 --> 00:23:30.092
P- P-P-P-Pom Pom!

284
00:23:52.638 --> 00:23:55.552
- Your flowers, Highness.
- Well, thank you.

285
00:23:55.667 --> 00:23:59.770
Oh, these are even prettier
than yesterday's.

286
00:23:59.885 --> 00:24:03.988
Here's the list of remaining
preparations for the festival tomorrow.

287
00:24:04.064 --> 00:24:08.167
Oh. We sure throw a lot of parties
around here, don't we?

288
00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:11.004
Oh, this is no mere party, Highness.

289
00:24:11.042 --> 00:24:13.382
This is the Spring Festival!

290
00:24:19.325 --> 00:24:22.546
Oh, good morning, fellas.
What do you have there?

291
00:24:22.585 --> 00:24:26.649
For you.
But they're too small.

292
00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:33.282
They're beautiful!
How very sweet. Thank you.

293
00:24:33.435 --> 00:24:35.659
Your Highness,
the festival committee is assembled...

294
00:24:35.812 --> 00:24:39.187
in the library
awaiting your instructions.

295
00:24:39.226 --> 00:24:43.021
And the bath is in the pantry
awaiting you.

296
00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:45.743
I'll see you later, boys.

297
00:24:45.859 --> 00:24:48.045
Good morning, Jaq.

298
00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:51.112
Hello, Mary.
Pretty coat!

299
00:24:51.265 --> 00:24:53.105
I made it for you.

300
00:24:55.291 --> 00:24:57.246
Want to try it on?

301
00:24:57.285 --> 00:25:00.008
Oh, very nice.

302
00:25:00.123 --> 00:25:02.078
Cinderelly forgot party list!

303
00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:06.487
Jaq can help.
Take list to Cinderelly!

304
00:25:14.347 --> 00:25:17.761
I- I-I-I-I got it!
No problem.

305
00:25:18.872 --> 00:25:21.748
I'll be right back.

306
00:25:23.703 --> 00:25:26.732
Very well, the prince and I will cut
the ribbon to begin the festival.

307
00:25:26.809 --> 00:25:28.688
Now, any other suggestions?

308
00:25:28.842 --> 00:25:33.021
I propose we move
the Spring Festival to summer.

309
00:25:33.136 --> 00:25:37.009
Genius! I wish I had
thought of it myself.

310
00:25:37.085 --> 00:25:40.268
Then I'm afraid it wouldn't be
a Spring Festival any more.

311
00:25:40.421 --> 00:25:45.406
- Yes, yes, quite so. Of course not, I dare say, Your Highness.
- Yummy.

312
00:25:45.521 --> 00:25:47.975
Perhaps this year we should
not invite the children.

313
00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:53.190
- Can't open.
- They appear to be always underfoot. No children. A brilliant idea.

314
00:25:53.228 --> 00:25:55.145
But the festival is for the children.

315
00:25:55.222 --> 00:25:57.676
And an even more brilliant rebuttal!

316
00:25:57.791 --> 00:26:02.392
Oh, I suppose.
But the lines are so long.

317
00:26:02.469 --> 00:26:04.922
No problem. We'll add more rides.

318
00:26:10.061 --> 00:26:14.700
Help! Oh, I can't stand mice!
Oh! Disgusting!

319
00:26:25.782 --> 00:26:27.622
Jaq, are you all right?

320
00:26:27.737 --> 00:26:31.763
No help to Cinderelly.
Just make a big mess.

321
00:26:31.801 --> 00:26:34.600
I'm sorry, Jaq.
Tell you what.

322
00:26:34.677 --> 00:26:37.860
I'm about to go out to the fairgrounds.
Why don't you come with me?

323
00:26:37.975 --> 00:26:41.694
- I could really use your help.
- Help? Zug-zug!

324
00:26:41.733 --> 00:26:44.340
Meet me at the stables
in ten minutes.

325
00:26:44.378 --> 00:26:46.219
No problem.

326
00:26:47.484 --> 00:26:49.286
Here we are. There, Charger.

327
00:27:04.125 --> 00:27:08.075
Wow. Not sure Cinderelly
can find me down here.

328
00:27:21.609 --> 00:27:24.102
Jaq?

329
00:27:24.179 --> 00:27:26.939
- Jaq?
- Hey, Cind-

330
00:27:30.659 --> 00:27:34.263
- Jaq?
- Your Highness, your escort is waiting for you outside.

331
00:27:34.416 --> 00:27:36.909
Thank you. Jaq?

332
00:27:36.986 --> 00:27:38.711
Cinderelly!

333
00:27:38.826 --> 00:27:42.353
Oh, well.
I guess he couldn't come.

334
00:27:42.468 --> 00:27:44.654
Oh, no!

335
00:27:45.805 --> 00:27:47.836
Cinderelly, wait!

336
00:27:58.612 --> 00:28:00.682
Cinderelly!

337
00:28:14.869 --> 00:28:16.709
Cinderelly?

338
00:28:18.703 --> 00:28:22.653
I never get to do anything any more.
I never get to help.

339
00:28:22.729 --> 00:28:25.605
Get left behind sitting in the dirt.
Used to help a lot.

340
00:28:25.681 --> 00:28:30.666
Now I'm too small to do this, too small
to do that, too small to help Cinderelly.

341
00:28:30.781 --> 00:28:33.427
No good to anybody!

342
00:28:33.503 --> 00:28:37.414
Castle not like old house. Castle for
big people. No place for mice. No place!

343
00:28:37.529 --> 00:28:40.866
Everything's bigger than me.
Even flowers bigger!

344
00:28:41.019 --> 00:28:43.435
Don't like being small.
Don't like being a mouse.

345
00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:45.429
I wish I was big!

346
00:28:58.504 --> 00:29:00.881
There, there, dear.

347
00:29:00.958 --> 00:29:02.913
Tell me all-

348
00:29:03.028 --> 00:29:04.907
Jaq? Uh, Jaq?

349
00:29:07.629 --> 00:29:10.736
Oh, there you are, dear.

350
00:29:10.889 --> 00:29:15.299
I heard your wish, Jaq.
Aren't you happy the way you are?

351
00:29:15.375 --> 00:29:18.289
Only big people help Cinderelly.
I want to be big!

352
00:29:18.366 --> 00:29:20.896
No, I want to be human.

353
00:29:21.011 --> 00:29:23.197
Human? Oh, good heavens!

354
00:29:23.274 --> 00:29:28.334
But, Jaq, you've always helped
Cinderella just the way you are.

355
00:29:28.411 --> 00:29:33.664
Cinderelly's a princess now. No time
for mice. Nobody likes mice anyway.

356
00:29:33.741 --> 00:29:36.234
So that's what you think.

357
00:29:36.349 --> 00:29:41.026
I get beat up by cat and-
and horse and- and big, scary lady!

358
00:29:42.867 --> 00:29:45.858
Humans are bigger.
Bigger better.

359
00:29:46.011 --> 00:29:49.002
If you really feel that way...

360
00:29:50.382 --> 00:29:54.562
perhaps it would be
for the best to grant your wish.

361
00:29:56.019 --> 00:29:59.163
Bibbidi bobbidi boo!

362
00:30:10.283 --> 00:30:13.810
The sun's up shining
Silver lining

363
00:30:13.887 --> 00:30:15.919
It's gonna be a beautiful day

364
00:30:16.034 --> 00:30:19.370
Jaq. The human Jaq.
How do you do?

365
00:30:19.485 --> 00:30:23.090
- Church bells ringing
Birds all singing - I- I-

366
00:30:23.166 --> 00:30:25.735
Everything's going my way

367
00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:28.726
Zug-zug. I really am human.

368
00:30:30.528 --> 00:30:33.979
Climb the trees
Smell the breeze

369
00:30:34.094 --> 00:30:37.583
Laugh with all your might

370
00:30:37.698 --> 00:30:42.990
Blue skies showing
Everything's going right

371
00:30:45.136 --> 00:30:48.320
You'll never stop the raining
by sitting and complaining

372
00:30:48.396 --> 00:30:52.269
It all comes down to you

373
00:30:52.346 --> 00:30:55.720
You'll smile again
It happens when

374
00:30:55.796 --> 00:30:59.247
You change your point of view

375
00:30:59.362 --> 00:31:04.846
- I love the view from up here!
- When you're small, one inch tall

376
00:31:04.961 --> 00:31:08.296
And then you're six foot two

377
00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:13.550
You've hit the big time now
and the world is looking up to you

378
00:31:13.626 --> 00:31:16.118
There she is.
What am I going to say?

379
00:31:17.346 --> 00:31:20.144
Princess Cinderelly,
it's me. Jaq!

380
00:31:20.183 --> 00:31:23.250
Look, I'm human now.
I'm human now too!

381
00:31:23.365 --> 00:31:26.702
When you're small
One inch tall

382
00:31:26.855 --> 00:31:29.884
And then you're six foot two

383
00:31:29.999 --> 00:31:32.606
- You've hit the big time now
- Princess Cinderelly!

384
00:31:32.644 --> 00:31:35.367
- The world is looking up to you
- It's me!

385
00:31:35.406 --> 00:31:37.130
Yeah, you

386
00:31:37.207 --> 00:31:39.202
- My dear sir.
- Oh, you poor man!

387
00:31:39.278 --> 00:31:42.806
- Sir, um- - I'm hu-
- Oh, Sir Hugh, is it?

388
00:31:42.921 --> 00:31:47.138
- Well, then. Pleased to know you.
- I, uh, " knows " to please you too!

389
00:31:47.177 --> 00:31:50.781
- Are you all right, Sir Hugh?
- Yes, yes, I- - Hugh, eh?

390
00:31:50.858 --> 00:31:53.235
- Would that be Belgian?
- What? Eh, no, no.

391
00:31:53.311 --> 00:31:55.306
No, no, no, of course not.
No accent.

392
00:31:55.382 --> 00:31:59.063
I'm so sorry about the mess.
Here, let me help you.

393
00:31:59.178 --> 00:32:02.284
No, no, that's why I'm here.
To- To help you. I'm-

394
00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:04.240
Aha! The committee sent you!

395
00:32:04.393 --> 00:32:06.923
Oh. You're here to help
with the Spring Festival?

396
00:32:07.038 --> 00:32:11.141
- You're Dutch!
- No. I mean yes. Uh, but I'm-

397
00:32:11.256 --> 00:32:14.975
Late! Your Highness, it is late.
We're expected back at the palace.

398
00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:20.420
- Shall we ride back together?
- Ride? On horses?

399
00:32:20.459 --> 00:32:22.797
- Nice horsie!
- Sir Hugh?

400
00:32:24.562 --> 00:32:27.015
Have you ridden before?

401
00:32:28.472 --> 00:32:32.575
Sir Hugh? Sir Hugh?
Oh, there you are.

402
00:32:35.067 --> 00:32:37.522
Oh. Peach blossoms.

403
00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:40.435
Aren't you sweet?
They're beautiful. Thank you.

404
00:32:43.312 --> 00:32:45.229
Ah, Highness, there you are.

405
00:32:45.305 --> 00:32:48.066
The tailor is in an absolute dither.
The cook is having a crisis.

406
00:32:48.142 --> 00:32:51.747
The animal trainer is flummoxed!
And they're all asking for you.

407
00:32:51.786 --> 00:32:54.623
Could you please find a vase for these?
I'll be right back.

408
00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:58.074
Thank you, Sir Hugh.
You're a big help.

409
00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:05.512
Perfect.
Helping Cinderelly with flowers.

410
00:33:21.464 --> 00:33:22.958
Pom Pom!

411
00:33:28.595 --> 00:33:30.473
I shouldn't be afraid of cat!

412
00:33:32.928 --> 00:33:36.264
I am human now.
Bigger than cat.

413
00:33:36.379 --> 00:33:38.641
But I am still afraid of cat!

414
00:33:45.236 --> 00:33:47.230
Oh, good.
You found a vase.

415
00:33:49.032 --> 00:33:51.984
Happy to help.
Uh, what I want to s-

416
00:33:52.023 --> 00:33:55.129
Your Highness, the Countess LeGrand
is awaiting you in the dining hall.

417
00:33:55.206 --> 00:33:58.273
Think you could keep
her company till I get there?

418
00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:06.248
A mouse!

419
00:34:07.859 --> 00:34:10.428
What am I doing?
I'm a man now.

420
00:34:10.543 --> 00:34:14.147
- A big, fat mouse!
- Oh, no. Gus-Gus!

421
00:34:15.566 --> 00:34:17.943
Get away!

422
00:34:25.995 --> 00:34:29.101
My hero.
Oh, you saved me.

423
00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:33.740
Well, I think we just found the couple
to lead the first dance.

424
00:34:36.348 --> 00:34:39.607
We better go get ready.
I'll send a valet for you, Sir Hugh.

425
00:34:39.722 --> 00:34:41.947
See you at the festival.

426
00:34:53.871 --> 00:34:56.440
Hey, Mary, where's Jaq-Jaq?

427
00:34:56.555 --> 00:35:00.389
I don't know, Gus.
I'm worried about him.

428
00:35:00.504 --> 00:35:03.610
Here I am.

429
00:35:03.648 --> 00:35:06.524
Wait!

430
00:35:07.522 --> 00:35:09.707
It's me.

431
00:35:09.783 --> 00:35:12.851
Jaq, is everything all right, dear?

432
00:35:12.966 --> 00:35:16.455
Uh, oh, yes. Great.
No problem.

433
00:35:16.531 --> 00:35:20.137
Well, I think you gave your friends
a bit of a fright.

434
00:35:22.437 --> 00:35:25.734
They ran away from me.
Even Mary.

435
00:35:25.811 --> 00:35:29.070
Oh, now surely you don't miss
being a mouse.

436
00:35:29.146 --> 00:35:31.639
No, I guess not.

437
00:35:31.754 --> 00:35:34.055
Aren't you happy being human?

438
00:35:34.093 --> 00:35:37.620
Yeah. Sure not as easy
as I thought.

439
00:35:40.305 --> 00:35:42.644
But I know I'll get it.

440
00:35:44.715 --> 00:35:47.667
Her Highness Cinderella
is asking for you.

441
00:35:47.743 --> 00:35:50.082
The evening's festivities
are upon us.

442
00:35:53.227 --> 00:35:56.409
- Zug-zug!
- Jaq?

443
00:35:56.447 --> 00:36:00.819
Zug-zug, eh? I don't believe
I'm familiar with that expression.

444
00:36:00.934 --> 00:36:03.886
Um, it-it means-
It's French.

445
00:36:04.001 --> 00:36:08.295
Aha! French is it?
Well, that explains everything.

446
00:36:12.283 --> 00:36:15.964
Ladies and gentlemen,
let the Spring Festival begin.

447
00:36:20.067 --> 00:36:23.403
- Race you to the Ferris wheel!
- Look there.

448
00:36:29.461 --> 00:36:31.609
Hi.

449
00:36:34.906 --> 00:36:39.354
Oh, an elephant!
Come on! I just love elephants!

450
00:36:39.469 --> 00:36:42.575
- Your Majesty, uh-
- Let's go!

451
00:36:42.651 --> 00:36:45.297
Around the world!

452
00:36:45.373 --> 00:36:50.051
Up and down. Up and down.
Around like a Ferris wheel.

453
00:36:50.166 --> 00:36:52.698
Uh, are you sure
Jaq-Jaq's here, Mary?

454
00:36:52.774 --> 00:36:55.266
He must be, Gus.
Let's find him.

455
00:36:58.333 --> 00:37:00.788
Sir Hugh, are you
enjoying yourself?

456
00:37:00.826 --> 00:37:03.778
Well, um, there's something-

457
00:37:03.855 --> 00:37:07.574
You're not whispering
about me, are you?

458
00:37:07.689 --> 00:37:11.178
I believe I promised
you two the first dance.

459
00:37:16.854 --> 00:37:20.765
What a lovely dancer.
Oh, my!

460
00:37:31.655 --> 00:37:33.418
Oh! Sir Hugh!

461
00:37:33.533 --> 00:37:35.489
Is that your kitty?

462
00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:38.518
Oh! Isn't she precious?

463
00:37:40.818 --> 00:37:42.544
Oh!

464
00:37:43.771 --> 00:37:45.803
Ready for the next dance?

465
00:38:12.797 --> 00:38:14.829
Nice kitty.

466
00:38:28.556 --> 00:38:30.473
Oh, I hate elephants!

467
00:38:37.452 --> 00:38:41.363
This is all my fault!
I wish Fairy Godmother was here.

468
00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:46.808
Jaq, this is your chance to help.

469
00:38:46.884 --> 00:38:48.993
What can I do?

470
00:38:49.069 --> 00:38:53.556
Hmm, an elephant.
What do you think could stop him?

471
00:38:53.594 --> 00:38:55.895
- Stop in the name of the king!
- Don't know.

472
00:38:56.010 --> 00:38:58.387
Perhaps a mouse?

473
00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:04.561
Aren't all elephants
afraid of mice?

474
00:39:04.638 --> 00:39:07.897
Are you a man or a mouse?

475
00:39:12.191 --> 00:39:14.568
I'm a mouse!

476
00:39:20.665 --> 00:39:23.655
Oh, dear, now!

477
00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:26.187
How does it go again?

478
00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:33.050
Oh, yes!
Bibbidi bobbidi boo!

479
00:39:36.616 --> 00:39:38.955
Help!

480
00:39:41.792 --> 00:39:44.706
Oh! I can see my castle!

481
00:39:51.914 --> 00:39:55.634
I guess there are some things
only a mouse can do.

482
00:39:55.711 --> 00:39:57.666
I'm a mouse!

483
00:39:59.123 --> 00:40:01.040
Yes! I'm a mouse!

484
00:40:02.382 --> 00:40:04.452
I'm a mouse! I'm a mouse!
I'm so glad I'm a mouse!

485
00:40:04.491 --> 00:40:07.751
I'm a mouse! Jaq is back!
I'm a mouse! A mouse!

486
00:40:07.866 --> 00:40:10.626
M- O-U-S-E
I'm a mousie mousie

487
00:40:10.741 --> 00:40:14.997
Oh. Sir Hugh's kitty!

488
00:40:15.112 --> 00:40:19.369
Come, sweetums.
Let's go find your master.

489
00:40:19.445 --> 00:40:23.586
Oh, aren't you just the sweetest,
little, most precious baby?

490
00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:29.146
Jaq, that was so brave!

491
00:40:29.223 --> 00:40:31.638
Mary, I really missed you.

492
00:40:31.715 --> 00:40:33.633
You're a hero!

493
00:40:33.671 --> 00:40:37.735
Jaq, you saved the day!
I can always count on you.

494
00:40:37.812 --> 00:40:40.036
- You're right there when I need you.
- I am?

495
00:40:40.112 --> 00:40:41.992
Yes, you are.

496
00:40:44.292 --> 00:40:46.823
I'm so glad you're back!

497
00:40:49.008 --> 00:40:50.811
Me too!

498
00:41:10.864 --> 00:41:14.468
- Thank goodness that's over.
- Yeah.

499
00:41:14.583 --> 00:41:17.305
No more magic for Jaq-Jaq!

500
00:41:17.382 --> 00:41:20.143
- Not even a little?
- Whoa!

501
00:41:27.735 --> 00:41:30.495
Hey, magic make this
go a lot faster!

502
00:41:36.861 --> 00:41:38.778
Let's go to work.

503
00:41:49.131 --> 00:41:51.086
Huh?

504
00:41:55.188 --> 00:41:58.563
- Good gracious!
- Oh, no!

505
00:41:58.679 --> 00:42:01.094
- I'm trying to sew.
- I'm splattered!

506
00:42:01.209 --> 00:42:03.586
- How awful!
- It's tragic!

507
00:42:03.701 --> 00:42:06.232
- I feel a bit pale.
- Watch out! That's my tail!

508
00:42:06.309 --> 00:42:08.532
I think we've had
quite enough magic.

509
00:42:14.476 --> 00:42:17.773
- What a mess! - Yeah, it's a mess,
all right. - A big, old, stinky mess.

510
00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:19.882
- Oh, we've seen worse!
- Yeah.

511
00:42:19.998 --> 00:42:23.487
- Remember when Anastasia fell
in love? - I sure do. - Yeah!

512
00:42:23.602 --> 00:42:26.669
Cinderella's stepsister?
That Anastasia?

513
00:42:26.746 --> 00:42:29.506
- Yeah!
- Now that's a messy story.

514
00:42:29.583 --> 00:42:32.804
No. It's a love story.

515
00:42:55.004 --> 00:42:56.500
Lucifer!

516
00:43:01.255 --> 00:43:04.130
Stop hogging the mirror!

517
00:43:05.358 --> 00:43:07.543
- That's mine!
- No! It's mine!

518
00:43:07.658 --> 00:43:10.419
- No! Mine!
- Hey! That's mine!

519
00:43:12.297 --> 00:43:14.445
Oh, you're right.

520
00:43:14.483 --> 00:43:17.896
- It is yours.
- You did that on purpose!

521
00:43:18.011 --> 00:43:20.618
- Did not! - Did too!
- Did not! - Did too!

522
00:43:20.733 --> 00:43:24.567
Girls, stop all this
bickering at once!

523
00:43:24.606 --> 00:43:28.785
Cinderella's ball is tomorrow night,
so pay attention!

524
00:43:28.862 --> 00:43:31.815
Every noble bachelor in
the kingdom will be there.

525
00:43:31.853 --> 00:43:36.722
If you want to find a husband, you have
to make the most of this opportunity.

526
00:43:36.837 --> 00:43:40.711
I won't let you fail me again.

527
00:43:40.748 --> 00:43:42.704
- Yes, Mother.
- Yes, Mother.

528
00:43:42.781 --> 00:43:45.157
Drizella, pin back those curls.

529
00:43:45.273 --> 00:43:48.648
Anastasia, put more colour
in your cheeks!

530
00:43:48.724 --> 00:43:50.909
A perfect appearance
is the only way...

531
00:43:50.948 --> 00:43:53.402
to attract a proper gentleman.

532
00:43:53.516 --> 00:43:57.236
We shall find you
men of wealth and nobility.

533
00:43:57.352 --> 00:43:59.959
- Maybe a count.
- Or a duke.

534
00:44:00.074 --> 00:44:01.915
Precisely.

535
00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:04.752
Come along now.
We need new gowns for the both of you.

536
00:44:04.867 --> 00:44:08.279
- With new shoes.
- And jewellery.

537
00:44:08.356 --> 00:44:12.535
The fancier the better.
Lucifer, come.

538
00:44:14.031 --> 00:44:15.948
Lucifer!

539
00:44:27.527 --> 00:44:30.518
Morning, Cinderelly!
Why you dressed like that?

540
00:44:30.595 --> 00:44:33.739
I'm going to the market in disguise
so no one will recognize me.

541
00:44:33.816 --> 00:44:37.075
I want to surprise the prince
with a garland of flowers.

542
00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:40.142
- Want to come along? - Oh,
yeah. Let's go! - Yes! Let's go!

543
00:44:40.219 --> 00:44:42.175
Gus-Gus come along.

544
00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:08.287
Remember the tradition.

545
00:45:08.363 --> 00:45:12.159
Give these to each other at the ball,
and you'll always be together.

546
00:45:13.732 --> 00:45:16.339
Don't you need a garland
of roses for the ball?

547
00:45:20.058 --> 00:45:22.091
Guaranteed to win you his heart.

548
00:45:22.167 --> 00:45:24.237
Anastasia, what are you doing?

549
00:45:24.314 --> 00:45:27.305
Oh! Nothing. Coming.

550
00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:07.029
Everything smells so good.

551
00:46:07.144 --> 00:46:10.441
Would you like one?
Oh, be careful. They're hot.

552
00:46:11.937 --> 00:46:14.851
Anastasia, I think not.

553
00:46:14.927 --> 00:46:19.414
Everything in this shop is
inferior.

554
00:46:20.641 --> 00:46:22.788
You can build a house
out of these bricks.

555
00:46:22.903 --> 00:46:24.820
Come along, Anastasia.

556
00:46:28.309 --> 00:46:32.681
You're not to say a word
to that shopkeeper.

557
00:46:32.719 --> 00:46:35.364
- I forbid it!
- Yes, Mother.

558
00:46:37.474 --> 00:46:40.196
He's got that look...

559
00:46:40.311 --> 00:46:42.228
and I know that look.

560
00:46:42.305 --> 00:46:44.337
Seasick?

561
00:46:45.564 --> 00:46:49.322
Oh, very funny.
I think they're in love.

562
00:46:49.398 --> 00:46:52.964
Anastasia's in love?
That's crazy, Cinderelly!

563
00:46:53.041 --> 00:46:57.028
Oh, come on, you two.
Anyone can fall in love.

564
00:46:57.067 --> 00:46:59.368
Anyone but Anastasia.

565
00:46:59.406 --> 00:47:03.471
- Maybe she just needs some help.
- Yeah, lots of help.

566
00:47:03.547 --> 00:47:06.461
Well, I had lots of help too,
remember?

567
00:47:07.803 --> 00:47:11.369
We have to figure out how
to get them together again.

568
00:47:11.446 --> 00:47:16.546
I know! We'll lure them into the
square, and here's how we'll do it.

569
00:47:16.623 --> 00:47:19.268
The birds will get her hat.
You get the baker's attention.

570
00:47:19.345 --> 00:47:24.713
Bring Anastasia back here. Get the baker to come
outside and they'll meet right in front of the shop.

571
00:47:24.828 --> 00:47:27.703
That's right, Gus.
They'll never know what hit them.

572
00:47:35.564 --> 00:47:38.018
- Hey.
- Okay, fellas...

573
00:47:38.095 --> 00:47:40.740
get his attention, and remember,
keep it simple.

574
00:48:06.124 --> 00:48:08.155
Mice in my baguettes!

575
00:48:16.668 --> 00:48:18.624
Lucifey!

576
00:48:24.797 --> 00:48:28.900
Come back here! Oh!
Oh! Filthy creatures!

577
00:48:47.918 --> 00:48:50.486
Are you okay?

578
00:48:50.563 --> 00:48:52.021
Oh, no!

579
00:49:12.879 --> 00:49:15.793
Anastasia?

580
00:49:15.870 --> 00:49:19.168
What are you doing here
dressed like that?

581
00:49:19.283 --> 00:49:22.159
You look like a laundry maid.

582
00:49:22.197 --> 00:49:24.689
I'm not the one
with egg on my face.

583
00:49:29.252 --> 00:49:32.320
I saw you in the baker's shop.

584
00:49:32.435 --> 00:49:35.617
He must think I'm-

585
00:49:35.694 --> 00:49:40.180
He saw it was an accident.
Don't give up so fast.

586
00:49:40.219 --> 00:49:43.593
What would you know?
You're beautiful.

587
00:49:43.631 --> 00:49:46.085
It's always been easy for you.

588
00:49:46.161 --> 00:49:49.383
Easy? That's not
how I remember it.

589
00:49:49.421 --> 00:49:52.987
Look, Anastasia, you just need
a little help, that's all.

590
00:49:53.025 --> 00:49:55.671
If I weren't
so clumsy and plain-

591
00:49:55.709 --> 00:49:57.857
Listen, why don't you
come back to the castle?

592
00:49:57.972 --> 00:50:01.729
We'll clean you up and then
we'll get you two together.

593
00:50:01.844 --> 00:50:05.602
But Mother forbids it!
She thinks he's beneath me.

594
00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:08.708
And I think she's wrong.
The baker's terrific.

595
00:50:08.784 --> 00:50:10.702
And he cooks too.

596
00:51:20.103 --> 00:51:22.711
Yoo-hoo!

597
00:51:28.308 --> 00:51:31.606
Lucifey like Pom Pom, yes?

598
00:51:31.644 --> 00:51:36.552
Mice can help if Lucifey promise
to stop chasing mice!

599
00:51:36.667 --> 00:51:38.777
Deal?

600
00:51:48.477 --> 00:51:51.545
- There. Good as new.
- Don't stop now!

601
00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:54.229
Mother says that looks
count for everything.

602
00:51:54.267 --> 00:51:59.252
Well, of course you want to look your best,
but that's not the most important thing.

603
00:51:59.367 --> 00:52:02.396
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What I need is a whole new look.

604
00:52:03.661 --> 00:52:05.885
Make me look good
make me look swell

605
00:52:05.962 --> 00:52:07.879
Make me look fine

606
00:52:09.490 --> 00:52:11.637
We're pourin' it on
you just sit back

607
00:52:11.675 --> 00:52:14.972
'Cause, baby, you're mine

608
00:52:15.049 --> 00:52:17.619
You send me into a spin

609
00:52:17.657 --> 00:52:20.571
Make a splash
when you walk in

610
00:52:20.648 --> 00:52:24.827
Those eyes so rare
the lips, the hair

611
00:52:24.904 --> 00:52:26.820
You're a breath of fresh air

612
00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:31.613
Brushing the fur
comb the hair out

613
00:52:31.690 --> 00:52:34.835
Trim up the toes

614
00:52:34.912 --> 00:52:36.905
Give me the dress and the shoes

615
00:52:36.943 --> 00:52:40.394
And the jewellery and clothes

616
00:52:40.471 --> 00:52:43.270
You can judge your books
from how the cover looks

617
00:52:43.386 --> 00:52:46.146
Wear make-up by the ounce

618
00:52:46.223 --> 00:52:52.242
But didn't they tell you
it's what's inside that counts

619
00:52:52.319 --> 00:52:54.466
Make me a star
make me look great

620
00:52:54.581 --> 00:52:57.495
Make me look grand

621
00:52:57.610 --> 00:53:00.562
I got style and grace
but it's a painted-up face

622
00:53:00.639 --> 00:53:03.822
Gets you a man

623
00:53:03.937 --> 00:53:06.084
Snip, cut
when we are through

624
00:53:06.123 --> 00:53:08.922
You're gonna look so good
it's true

625
00:53:08.999 --> 00:53:12.028
The fur, the bows
the chin, the nose

626
00:53:12.143 --> 00:53:14.980
Oh, ah
Ooh-la-la

627
00:53:15.057 --> 00:53:20.310
Looks won't hide
It's what's inside that counts

628
00:53:20.387 --> 00:53:26.636
You wanna be a bride
It's what's inside that counts

629
00:53:26.675 --> 00:53:28.746
What about a necklace?

630
00:53:32.350 --> 00:53:34.267
- Lucifer!
- Stupid cat.

631
00:53:36.299 --> 00:53:40.785
Remember, you'll catch more flies
with honey than with vinegar.

632
00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:43.814
What does that mean?
Who'd want to catch flies?

633
00:53:43.891 --> 00:53:48.530
I mean the best way to impress
the baker is just to be nice to him.

634
00:53:48.607 --> 00:53:53.017
- How do I do that?
- You could start with a smile.

635
00:53:53.093 --> 00:53:55.433
Better get me
a bigger necklace.

636
00:53:58.615 --> 00:54:00.724
Come on.

637
00:54:20.356 --> 00:54:23.768
- I make babies cry too.
- Here.

638
00:54:27.526 --> 00:54:29.711
He'll never be able to resist.

639
00:54:29.826 --> 00:54:32.204
You think so?

640
00:54:32.242 --> 00:54:34.351
But what if Mother catches me?

641
00:54:34.427 --> 00:54:37.304
She told me never to speak
to the baker again!

642
00:54:37.381 --> 00:54:40.064
Maybe it's time to stop following
someone else's orders...

643
00:54:40.179 --> 00:54:43.707
and start following your heart.

644
00:54:43.745 --> 00:54:46.200
It's late!
I have to go!

645
00:54:46.238 --> 00:54:49.574
But what about the baker?

646
00:54:49.612 --> 00:54:52.679
I could walk you to his shop.

647
00:54:52.718 --> 00:54:55.670
Meet you in the market
at noon tomorrow?

648
00:54:55.746 --> 00:54:58.239
I can hardly wait!

649
00:56:07.449 --> 00:56:11.858
Mother, I have to run to town.
We're out of bread.

650
00:56:11.973 --> 00:56:14.198
Hey!

651
00:56:14.313 --> 00:56:16.996
Excuse me. Can I borrow this?
Thanks!

652
00:56:23.976 --> 00:56:25.892
Oh!

653
00:56:52.119 --> 00:56:55.186
I'll wait for you
by the apple cart.

654
00:57:01.130 --> 00:57:03.775
- Do you think she'll like them?
- They're beautiful!

655
00:57:03.852 --> 00:57:06.728
She's going to love them!

656
00:57:30.655 --> 00:57:32.801
What? What happened?

657
00:57:36.176 --> 00:57:38.131
Anastasia!

658
00:58:59.305 --> 00:59:01.490
Run for it!

659
00:59:23.652 --> 00:59:25.877
The deal is off!

660
01:00:17.831 --> 01:00:21.322
Don't look at me!
I look horrible!

661
01:00:21.398 --> 01:00:23.238
Wait! Please!

662
01:00:43.023 --> 01:00:45.132
Anastasia!

663
01:00:45.209 --> 01:00:48.123
How dare you defy me!

664
01:00:48.238 --> 01:00:50.577
You were forbidden
to speak to this man!

665
01:00:50.654 --> 01:00:54.143
Oh, look at her!
It's a disaster!

666
01:00:54.258 --> 01:00:57.901
We'll be the laughing stock
of the entire town.

667
01:00:57.939 --> 01:01:01.582
You've embarrassed yourself
quite enough with this foolishness.

668
01:01:03.077 --> 01:01:07.717
Dear child, you know I only have
your best interests at heart.

669
01:01:07.832 --> 01:01:10.516
You deserve better.
Come along.

670
01:01:10.554 --> 01:01:13.199
No, Mother!
You're wrong!

671
01:01:15.309 --> 01:01:17.993
- He's sweet.
- She's wonderful.

672
01:01:18.069 --> 01:01:22.747
He's romantic. And we are going
to the ball together.

673
01:01:30.914 --> 01:01:32.985
Drizella, come along.

674
01:01:37.932 --> 01:01:39.848
Drizella!

675
01:02:05.730 --> 01:02:09.756
Oh, thank you!
