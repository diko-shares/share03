00:00:30,048 --> 00:00:32,557
"A young man enters a taxi"

2
00:00:32,557 --> 00:00:35,127
"and the tour begins."

3
00:00:36,037 --> 00:00:41,060
"The taxi is speeding up to 130 km/h (80 mph) in town."

4
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:46,703
Please, could you be more careful, I have four kids at home.

5
00:00:46,703 --> 00:00:48,935
You have four kids at home?

6
00:00:48,935 --> 00:00:52,009
And there you tell me to be more careful?!

7
00:00:53,051 --> 00:00:56,136
Forget about it, Dieter, okay?!

8
00:02:04,466 --> 00:02:06,438
Is this correct?

9
00:02:06,472 --> 00:02:08,407
Clear the rubbish from the rear seats first.

10
00:02:08,407 --> 00:02:10,095
Okay, boss.

11
00:02:27,318 --> 00:02:29,356
How did the shift go?

12
00:02:32,241 --> 00:02:34,057
Any news about your son?

13
00:02:34,056 --> 00:02:36,976
Have you made a decision?

14
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,239
Yes!

15
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:41,742
"Good Boy".

16
00:04:11,973 --> 00:04:14,582
These were still in her car.

17
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,846
Not a lot has changed.

18
00:04:46,846 --> 00:04:49,634
Almost 10 years have passed since last time.

19
00:04:49,634 --> 00:04:52,137
It was not because of Rita.

20
00:04:58,738 --> 00:05:00,781
Where is he?

21
00:05:30,036 --> 00:05:32,560
You still have your cave here.

22
00:05:38,281 --> 00:05:39,593
Thanks.

23
00:05:44,619 --> 00:05:46,612
Enjoy your meal.

24
00:06:32,577 --> 00:06:34,589
I am sorry about your mum.

25
00:06:54,673 --> 00:06:57,699
How about a hamburger, like them over there?

26
00:07:02,697 --> 00:07:04,055
Yes?

27
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,514
Sorry, ain't got no time now.

28
00:07:09,747 --> 00:07:12,271
Can you manage on your own?

29
00:07:13,483 --> 00:07:17,649
Damn it... Yeah, okay. See you soon, bye.

30
00:07:20,053 --> 00:07:23,427
I have to start another round.

31
00:07:23,463 --> 00:07:24,552
These are yours now

32
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,531
You certainly know the way.

33
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:55,288
Oh No, the light, I am always getting ten years older

34
00:09:00,304 --> 00:09:02,058
Pst! The lad is sleeping.

35
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:06,826
Come and have a look.

36
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,816
Locked up.

37
00:09:31,068 --> 00:09:33,072
We can drink now.

38
00:09:42,591 --> 00:09:48,037
Hey, Sven. Let's toast to our new life.

39
00:09:48,037 --> 00:09:50,470
Sven!

40
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,145
He's not talking to me any more.

41
00:09:54,145 --> 00:09:57,274
What do you expect after all these years?

42
00:09:57,274 --> 00:09:59,206
That he hugs you straight away?

43
00:09:59,206 --> 00:10:00,930
Would be the least, wouldn't it?

44
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,079
Achim, I did not cook, but look how I am crouched down.

45
00:10:07,869 --> 00:10:11,554
Honestly, what do you think...?

46
00:10:11,554 --> 00:10:15,143
Can you imagine me as "father"?

47
00:10:15,142 --> 00:10:20,163
Yes, I think you would be a wonderful dad.

48
00:10:20,164 --> 00:10:22,247
I am afraid that I lack the experience.

49
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,518
You never have been...

50
00:10:26,608 --> 00:10:30,218
You know what? At first we need a bigger flat. Big, ...

51
00:10:30,218 --> 00:10:30,955
We?

52
00:10:30,955 --> 00:10:32,097
Yes!

53
00:10:32,664 --> 00:10:34,771
Evi is moving out, into a great flat.

54
00:10:34,771 --> 00:10:37,875
It's really great. Since we are already 3.

55
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:40,552
You were always strong in maths.

56
00:10:40,552 --> 00:10:42,470
I can even count to 4.

57
00:10:58,728 --> 00:11:00,198
Hello.

58
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:04,898
where is he?

59
00:11:06,005 --> 00:11:08,549
Him?

60
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,939
Do you mean your father?

61
00:11:10,939 --> 00:11:13,458
He's just gone, driving already.

62
00:11:14,654 --> 00:11:17,542
Are you living here too?

63
00:11:19,952 --> 00:11:21,925
Would that be so bad?

64
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:31,651
Chronic lack of sleep?

65
00:11:33,249 --> 00:11:36,172
Shouldn't the little one sleep through now?

66
00:11:36,172 --> 00:11:38,353
Come on, Dieter, let it be.

67
00:11:38,768 --> 00:11:41,470
Two taxi drivers are talking to each other:

68
00:11:41,616 --> 00:11:44,526
I am totally broke ("sitting on dry ground").

69
00:11:44,526 --> 00:11:47,640
Aren't you lucky, I am about to go drown.

70
00:11:50,675 --> 00:11:52,744
And? I like this one.

71
00:11:55,366 --> 00:11:58,962
Alright, here is the freight.

72
00:13:04,714 --> 00:13:07,178
Where do you want to go?

73
00:13:07,836 --> 00:13:08,673
Us?

74
00:13:08,673 --> 00:13:10,741
Is there anybody else?

75
00:13:12,696 --> 00:13:13,890
To the movies.

76
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:16,539
Hop on, I give you a ride.

77
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,283
Come on.

78
00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:38,777
I've got asthma. Got it from my parents genes.

79
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:40,152
Ah, okay.

80
00:13:40,871 --> 00:13:43,786
Sven says that I could still become an actor.

81
00:13:43,786 --> 00:13:46,286
I am talented, ain't I, Sven?

82
00:13:47,922 --> 00:13:50,426
So Sven is your manager now?

83
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:53,305
I tutored him once.

84
00:13:54,765 --> 00:13:57,764
Why can't I come any longer?

85
00:13:59,591 --> 00:14:03,616
I don't object. You need to speak to Sven.

86
00:14:03,616 --> 00:14:05,327
And to your parents, of course.

87
00:14:05,326 --> 00:14:07,088
Well, my mom doesn't care anyway.

88
00:14:07,088 --> 00:14:09,377
She likes it, when I am not around.

89
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,762
He too doesn't have a father.

90
00:14:38,107 --> 00:14:40,208
Do you have any friends?

91
00:14:40,518 --> 00:14:42,461
Your age?

92
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:46,750
How do you spend your day?

93
00:14:47,067 --> 00:14:50,362
Apart from movies and computer?

94
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:56,219
I do have friends, but I had to move.

95
00:15:41,877 --> 00:15:44,698
At first I only had a job during studying.

96
00:15:45,184 --> 00:15:48,648
And then you were there and I had to feed the whole family.

97
00:15:48,877 --> 00:15:52,206
Back then, I bought my first taxi.

98
00:15:52,206 --> 00:15:54,297
The meter was at 630.000 Km (390600 Miles)

99
00:15:54,297 --> 00:15:57,841
Sven? Are you inspecting your inheritance?

100
00:15:57,841 --> 00:16:00,714
If dad continues to make debts, then nothing will be left.

101
00:16:00,715 --> 00:16:02,861
Cut it out. We're not there yet.

102
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,611
But almost.

103
00:16:04,612 --> 00:16:05,667
Do you want to run the shop in the future?

104
00:16:05,667 --> 00:16:09,283
Hey! The boy's great at school, no need to become a taxidriver.

105
00:16:09,283 --> 00:16:11,948
Hopefully, we won't be a poor student.

106
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:26,438
So, start the engine on "D".

107
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:30,004
Release the brakes.

108
00:16:43,947 --> 00:16:46,543
Hey! Stopp, Stopp, Stopp!

109
00:16:50,316 --> 00:16:51,804
Almost!

110
00:16:51,804 --> 00:16:52,898
I said, just a little bit.

111
00:16:52,898 --> 00:16:57,660
Reverse now, release the brakes, slowly.

112
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:04,323
Great job.

113
00:17:04,718 --> 00:17:06,944
But your father's right.

114
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:08,593
One can never stop learning.

115
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,884
Dads are always right.

116
00:17:13,884 --> 00:17:16,367
Did you now?

117
00:17:16,367 --> 00:17:17,677
Yes.

118
00:17:18,915 --> 00:17:22,201
Before I forget, we have a BBQ on Saturday.

119
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:24,542
I would be glad if you could come,

120
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:26,144
don't let yourself get convinced by him.

121
00:17:26,144 --> 00:17:27,868
No. Never.

122
00:17:27,985 --> 00:17:32,389
My son is just 11, but I've got a daughter your age.

123
00:18:24,595 --> 00:18:26,750
Excuse me.

124
00:18:28,227 --> 00:18:30,069
Won't be long.

125
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,463
As she leaned over the reeling...

126
00:18:48,742 --> 00:18:49,870
Yes?

127
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,068
... she felt dizzy.

128
00:18:53,147 --> 00:18:55,368
One comes home, expecting no trouble...

129
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:58,686
And the wife acts like a real housewife.

130
00:18:58,686 --> 00:19:01,839
What a shock this must be for you.

131
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:03,716
You also could put my slippers here.

132
00:19:04,026 --> 00:19:07,713
Of course, did Rita do this all the time?

133
00:19:08,712 --> 00:19:10,391
What's up?

134
00:19:10,391 --> 00:19:12,185
Why?

135
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:14,239
You act so strange...

136
00:19:15,212 --> 00:19:17,228
Your nuts.

137
00:19:20,564 --> 00:19:22,402
Cut it out.

138
00:19:22,402 --> 00:19:24,002
Cut it out.

139
00:19:27,501 --> 00:19:29,524
don't let me disturb you.

140
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:37,104
Where were we?

141
00:19:37,104 --> 00:19:39,389
You stopped at "dizzy".

142
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:42,982
Actually he's called Rolf, but I call him Rollmops.

143
00:19:43,189 --> 00:19:45,001
Just for myself, of course.

144
00:19:45,713 --> 00:19:47,790
I don't like him a lot.

145
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:50,290
Luckily he only comes on weekends.

146
00:19:50,588 --> 00:19:51,906
Help yourself.

147
00:19:51,906 --> 00:19:53,147
Thanks.

148
00:19:55,864 --> 00:19:59,738
If he is here, they just stay in bed, having sex.

149
00:19:59,787 --> 00:20:01,530
If you know, what I mean.

150
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:02,962
Do we?

151
00:20:02,962 --> 00:20:05,031
No idea.

152
00:20:07,787 --> 00:20:10,215
Sven, don't you like it?

153
00:20:10,214 --> 00:20:13,636
Just put the damn headset down.

154
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:15,925
At least during dinner.

155
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:23,079
Sven! Hello, I am talking to you!

156
00:20:24,922 --> 00:20:27,154
Damn it!

157
00:20:35,508 --> 00:20:39,559
Anyway, "Rollmops" wants us to move in with him,

158
00:20:39,594 --> 00:20:42,862
but I ain't going to such a forsaken place.

159
00:20:44,297 --> 00:20:46,489
When are you getting picked up by your mom?

160
00:20:47,565 --> 00:20:50,559
Erm, could I sleepover at Sven's?

161
00:20:52,173 --> 00:20:53,776
I am not sure if you mom...

162
00:20:53,776 --> 00:20:55,642
She is fine with that.

163
00:20:56,197 --> 00:20:58,051
Well, I am not.

164
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,966
I don't want him to stay.

165
00:21:03,942 --> 00:21:05,133
Why not?

166
00:21:05,587 --> 00:21:07,142
Because!

167
00:21:42,076 --> 00:21:43,902
New perfume?

168
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:46,323
It's the gift from you.

169
00:21:45,922 --> 00:21:47,873
And I thought, you didn't like it?

170
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:56,423
"The cloud riding moon looked considerably down on the fragrance, ...

171
00:21:56,424 --> 00:21:58,255
Silly ass.

172
00:21:58,254 --> 00:22:03,848
... how lucky to be loved and to love, how lucky..." or so.

173
00:22:03,849 --> 00:22:05,477
Or so...

174
00:22:05,477 --> 00:22:07,185
Yes.

175
00:22:10,337 --> 00:22:12,118
Tell me,

176
00:22:12,118 --> 00:22:14,481
do you know that your son is shaving himself?

177
00:22:14,481 --> 00:22:16,635
He is getting 18 soon.

178
00:22:21,105 --> 00:22:25,258
I meant everywhere, the legs, the arm pits, he pubic hair.

179
00:22:25,258 --> 00:22:27,636
This is common today.

180
00:22:29,218 --> 00:22:30,260
How'd you know?

181
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,382
He forgot to lock up.

182
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,328
Indeed.

183
00:22:34,328 --> 00:22:37,368
Come on, you are still getting on with each other.

184
00:22:37,977 --> 00:22:41,487
Same as you two are getting on.

185
00:22:41,338 --> 00:22:43,221
We are making progress.

186
00:22:44,087 --> 00:22:48,186
It's almost normal already, you shouting at him.

187
00:22:48,186 --> 00:22:51,250
He's a young lad, the juices are streaming

188
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:54,518
and he jacks off. "If you know what I mean".

189
00:22:55,066 --> 00:22:57,558
Hey, he masturbates like a champion, really.

190
00:22:58,233 --> 00:23:01,895
We have a sharp rise in using paper tissues.

191
00:23:03,778 --> 00:23:06,256
I think that something is wrong with him.

192
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,446
Cut it out, Julia.

193
00:23:10,862 --> 00:23:13,600
Maybe he is gay.

194
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,798
He lost his mom, that's all there is.

195
00:23:21,173 --> 00:23:26,858
Witte calls a taxi and gets to a gorgeous mansion with a pool.

196
00:23:26,858 --> 00:23:33,153
And then he said: "Super and he leads the pastor to a hut, with a straw bed and things.

197
00:23:33,153 --> 00:23:35,027
Man Dieter, think about the kids.

198
00:23:35,028 --> 00:23:36,847
Come on, it's a clean joke.

199
00:23:36,847 --> 00:23:37,661
I know it already.

200
00:23:37,661 --> 00:23:38,996
Really?!

201
00:23:38,996 --> 00:23:45,785
The pastor is complaining: "Petre, you are mixing things up, all my life I preached and worked in God's house...

202
00:23:46,617 --> 00:23:54,709
Yes, but they all fell asleep during your service and prayed in the taxi then.

203
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:56,161
Dieter, I knew this joke.

204
00:23:56,161 --> 00:23:58,511
Yeah, okay.

205
00:23:58,512 --> 00:24:00,037
Oh, mum!

206
00:24:02,225 --> 00:24:04,702
Your daughter is really cute.

207
00:24:04,982 --> 00:24:07,243
How did you do that, two such cute kids?

208
00:24:07,244 --> 00:24:10,056
Just by using my genes.

209
00:24:10,042 --> 00:24:11,837
Steak, sausages?

210
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,935
erm... sausage, but small and larger for Achim.

211
00:24:15,926 --> 00:24:18,772
Jennifer started an apprenticeship at a solicitor.

212
00:24:18,772 --> 00:24:20,171
Really? Super!

213
00:24:20,171 --> 00:24:23,767
We are all so proud, aren't we my "chicken"?

214
00:24:23,767 --> 00:24:25,750
Leave the kid alone.

215
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:27,903
I just mentioned the apprenticeship.

216
00:24:28,334 --> 00:24:30,318
Where on earth is Sven?

217
00:24:31,462 --> 00:24:34,346
Such a gentleman, leaving you there on your own.

218
00:24:34,346 --> 00:24:35,892
I don't care.

219
00:24:38,527 --> 00:24:42,286
Oh no, it's like a boys choir and I don't like it at all. Such shit.

220
00:24:42,286 --> 00:24:43,565
Did you ever sing in a choir?

221
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,178
Everything alright?

222
00:24:45,408 --> 00:24:46,514
Yes.

223
00:24:46,714 --> 00:24:49,870
Man, turn on some good music.

224
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:53,580
Careful Roland, it's my favourite disc.

225
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:55,998
Achim, your boy has taste.

226
00:25:02,865 --> 00:25:06,358
Sven, Lukas, turn it down.

227
00:25:27,207 --> 00:25:28,817
But without Doris...

228
00:25:28,817 --> 00:25:30,995
and only with my monthly salary, ...

229
00:25:30,995 --> 00:25:32,294
we couldn't even afford the house.

230
00:25:32,295 --> 00:25:34,493
But at least you are getting paid each month.

231
00:25:34,527 --> 00:25:36,962
Just listen to the Entrepreneur.

232
00:25:36,962 --> 00:25:38,526
Have you ever been at my home?

233
00:25:38,464 --> 00:25:40,163
You had to pay your support for years.

234
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:41,802
It's not getting any cheaper now.

235
00:25:41,801 --> 00:25:45,463
Very bare residence, nacked bulbs at the ceiling.

236
00:25:47,769 --> 00:25:51,740
Everybody should be blissed.

237
00:25:52,632 --> 00:25:56,027
Hey Kordula - your pint is empty. Another one?

238
00:25:56,027 --> 00:25:58,520
No, thanks. I can't have another one.

239
00:25:58,545 --> 00:26:02,885
Jennifer, can you check if there is any juice in the cellar?

240
00:26:02,885 --> 00:26:05,337
Sven, just help her.

241
00:26:05,337 --> 00:26:08,190
And where is your "prince", Kordula?

242
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:09,970
"Prince"? Why?

243
00:26:09,971 --> 00:26:13,663
have you ever met an African, who isn't a prince?

244
00:26:13,663 --> 00:26:16,360
Gastong has to work.

245
00:26:17,474 --> 00:26:19,800
say, when is it?

246
00:26:19,861 --> 00:26:23,022
End of November, according to plan.

247
00:26:23,022 --> 00:26:25,974
And what about you two? Don't you want?

248
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:29,923
We are working on it.

249
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:32,421
Old man can't rush.

250
00:26:32,421 --> 00:26:34,935
Man Dieter, you are a nuisance.

251
00:26:34,935 --> 00:26:37,534
It's okay. He is absolutely right.

252
00:26:37,534 --> 00:26:40,692
Yes, you are a horrible old man.

253
00:26:40,692 --> 00:26:47,204
Just think. Would my child finish school, I would be over 60.

254
00:26:47,204 --> 00:26:49,753

Joachim's kids always go for "A levels".

255
00:26:49,753 --> 00:26:51,919
And what good would it bring for the child to have such an old father?

256
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,405
But nothing is more sad than a childless couple.

257
00:26:55,404 --> 00:26:59,856
I am currently fully enjoying to be a father.

258
00:26:59,856 --> 00:27:02,357
Sorry, WE are enjoying it.

259
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,422
No problem.

260
00:27:06,608 --> 00:27:08,389
You can't ask for more good luck.

261
00:27:12,404 --> 00:27:15,935
You could even start dancing.

262
00:27:31,565 --> 00:27:37,942
Okay, I admit it. What's the sentence?

263
00:27:39,063 --> 00:27:43,912
I thoroughly enjoyed the night out and you?

264
00:27:45,084 --> 00:27:46,215
Sven?

265
00:27:46,216 --> 00:27:50,226
Didn't you notice, how much rubbish you are talking?

266
00:27:50,226 --> 00:27:52,839
Why? I didn't do it wrong.

267
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:58,569
47 plus 18, no 19, such a child has to be made first.


268
00:27:58,568 --> 00:28:02,553
OMG, you and your paranoia!

269
00:28:02,553 --> 00:28:04,839
Just to take on some responsibility once in a while.

270
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:07,404
You never have taken any, not even once.

271
00:28:07,404 --> 00:28:09,868
I am working on it.

272
00:28:09,868 --> 00:28:12,897
Did you ever fall in love?

273
00:28:13,966 --> 00:28:16,050
I don't think you can.

274
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:20,675
Yet again, my inability to love.

275
00:28:21,529 --> 00:28:26,237
I had to endure this for many years, but still I am sought after.

276
00:28:26,236 --> 00:28:28,916
Cut it out. I can't hear it anymore. Stop the car.

277
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:30,421
But you are totally drunk.

278
00:28:30,421 --> 00:28:33,362
stop the car now, I want to get out.

279
00:28:46,293 --> 00:28:47,592
Julia!

280
00:28:56,674 --> 00:29:01,567
Stop being such a drama queen and be reasonable.

281
00:29:01,567 --> 00:29:03,934
I am sorry, yes?

282
00:29:03,835 --> 00:29:06,018
Let go of me, you asshole.

283
00:29:32,317 --> 00:29:33,610
For you as well?

284
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,809
Okay.

285
00:29:40,755 --> 00:29:46,076
Did you know that drunkards can only say one thing?

286
00:29:47,542 --> 00:29:48,647
No.

287
00:29:48,646 --> 00:29:49,913
It's true.

288
00:29:50,461 --> 00:29:55,894
Just one thing. all night long.

289
00:29:55,894 --> 00:30:00,719
Maybe the whole life is as monotone.

290
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,051
Cheers.

291
00:30:05,284 --> 00:30:09,898
There are long ans short sentences.

292
00:30:10,872 --> 00:30:16,529
And with long ones, you feel free.

293
00:30:17,808 --> 00:30:19,709
Do you get me?

294
00:30:22,843 --> 00:30:25,285
I did study philosophy once.

295
00:30:25,285 --> 00:30:28,409
Enough to spoil a character.

296
00:30:36,111 --> 00:30:38,391
Why doesn't she go looking for another partner?

297
00:30:38,391 --> 00:30:39,516
Julia?

298
00:30:41,691 --> 00:30:47,191
It is probably because of this monotony.

299
00:30:51,053 --> 00:30:52,791
And Jennifer...

300
00:30:54,642 --> 00:30:57,448
...the little blond has a crush on you.

301
00:30:58,498 --> 00:31:00,130
You didn't notice, did you?

302
00:31:03,897 --> 00:31:08,813
You're the same as me, aren't you?

303
00:31:08,713 --> 00:31:13,592
If the ladies have a crush on you, they have lost already.

304
00:31:13,591 --> 00:31:15,760
Right?

305
00:31:26,179 --> 00:31:29,534
It's still filthy here, don't you see?

306
00:31:29,534 --> 00:31:31,810
It's easy to spot.

307
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:34,722
Just close it, I want to start moving.

308
00:31:34,722 --> 00:31:36,812
I cannot understand why Kordula fell for him.

309
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:40,543
It's a system. These guys know the bible inside out.

310
00:31:40,543 --> 00:31:44,447
They just follow the bible:
Be fertile and grow in numbers and become the earth's lords.

311
00:31:44,447 --> 00:31:46,686
It's about time to do something about this.

312
00:31:46,686 --> 00:31:49,384
BTW, greetings from Doris. It was a nice night, wasn't it?

313
00:31:49,385 --> 00:31:51,430
yes, we all had great fun.

314
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:52,429
Did it last much longer?

315
00:31:53,782 --> 00:31:56,206
Could you please drop this for Julia at the hotel?

316
00:31:58,945 --> 00:31:59,925
Blouses?

317
00:32:00,632 --> 00:32:01,914
Dress.

318
00:32:02,164 --> 00:32:04,981
Just marry her and make her pregnant. Would be a sensible thing to do.

319
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,088
Ralf, stop bullshitting me.

320
00:32:07,088 --> 00:32:08,453
If it would be that easy.

321
00:32:08,453 --> 00:32:10,127
Someone is longing to see you.

322
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:20,414
Yes?

323
00:32:22,752 --> 00:32:24,132
I have to talk to you.

324
00:32:24,132 --> 00:32:25,453
I'm listening.

325
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,017
It I were you, I would close the door.

326
00:32:37,111 --> 00:32:39,475
Go on, tell what he did with you.

327
00:32:39,475 --> 00:32:41,569
Open your mouth, will you?!

328
00:32:41,569 --> 00:32:44,400
Just tell what Sven did to you.

329
00:32:50,665 --> 00:32:52,460
come on, have a seat.

330
00:32:56,939 --> 00:32:58,341
Go on.

331
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,201
Sven.

332
00:33:22,257 --> 00:33:24,343
come along, we are going home.

333
00:33:23,943 --> 00:33:25,700
Why? I am just doing homework.

334
00:33:25,734 --> 00:33:27,391
You are coming right now!

335
00:33:36,963 --> 00:33:38,188
Unlock!

336
00:33:46,902 --> 00:33:48,948
Where is it?

337
00:33:48,949 --> 00:33:51,177
I want to see this damn videotape right now.

338
00:33:52,767 --> 00:33:53,852
Okay!

339
00:34:34,475 --> 00:34:35,785
Unlock!

340
00:34:37,749 --> 00:34:39,408
Open up!!

341
00:35:18,935 --> 00:35:22,064
I'm from a casting agency and looking for movie actors.

342
00:35:22,064 --> 00:35:23,922
Would you like to join?

343
00:35:23,922 --> 00:35:26,006
Oh yes, please. What do I need to do?

344
00:35:27,103 --> 00:35:28,805
Introduce yourself first. What's your name?

345
00:35:29,403 --> 00:35:33,615
I am called Patrick.

346
00:35:34,379 --> 00:35:36,129
Can you make a funny face?

347
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:36,965
okay

348
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,326
And can you make a sad face?

349
00:35:40,886 --> 00:35:44,576
Just imagine..., imagine someone has died.

350
00:35:45,004 --> 00:35:46,310
Like when my dad did die?

351
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,157
Yes, for example.

352
00:35:48,827 --> 00:35:49,722
Okay.

353
00:35:55,641 --> 00:35:56,290
Like this?

354
00:35:56,884 --> 00:35:57,651
Super.

355
00:35:59,086 --> 00:36:00,889
Cold, cold, cold.

356
00:36:04,908 --> 00:36:05,924
Warmer.

357
00:36:08,182 --> 00:36:10,836
Even warmer, really hot.

358
00:36:12,218 --> 00:36:14,015
I can see you.

359
00:36:15,295 --> 00:36:16,812
And when are you opening the door?

360
00:36:17,093 --> 00:36:17,909
One moment.

361
00:36:20,346 --> 00:36:22,050
Maybe you know the magic word.

362
00:36:23,456 --> 00:36:24,442
Smashing.

363
00:36:25,423 --> 00:36:26,093
Cool, isn't it??

364
00:36:26,093 --> 00:36:26,814
Indeed.

365
00:36:28,552 --> 00:36:30,266
And this is your office now?

366
00:36:30,266 --> 00:36:32,224
Yes, it is.

367
00:36:32,613 --> 00:36:33,423
Cool.

368
00:36:33,495 --> 00:36:35,459
To be safe.

369
00:36:39,088 --> 00:36:40,401
Superstar.

370
00:36:44,373 --> 00:36:45,862
You want to see my bum?

371
00:36:48,778 --> 00:36:49,901
Don't show anybody, please?!

372
00:36:51,144 --> 00:36:52,624
Do you know, how to kiss?

373
00:37:29,158 --> 00:37:31,643
You disgusting, dirty pig.

374
00:39:46,292 --> 00:39:52,228
Sven! Open up! Open up!!

375
00:39:57,431 --> 00:40:00,367
Sven! you have to throw up. Throw up!

376
00:40:04,172 --> 00:40:05,443
One more time.

377
00:40:07,637 --> 00:40:10,894
Sven, everything's gonna be allright, my boy.

378
00:40:31,443 --> 00:40:34,071
You do know your fairy tales, do you?

379
00:40:36,706 --> 00:40:40,114
Then you should know, what the dog, the cat and the donkey told the rooster.

380
00:40:42,865 --> 00:40:45,967
Everywhere you will find something better than Death.

381
00:41:10,797 --> 00:41:12,492
"To rent"

382
00:41:13,073 --> 00:41:14,573
That is all?

383
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,766
It's turning itself off.

384
00:42:14,828 --> 00:42:16,261
Not so fast, it won't.

385
00:42:27,616 --> 00:42:30,428
I never did anything, you didn't like.

386
00:42:32,605 --> 00:42:34,236
You're not serious, aren' you?

387
00:42:39,336 --> 00:42:41,023
If you love somebody...

388
00:42:45,098 --> 00:42:47,074
... you can't hurt him.

389
00:42:49,144 --> 00:42:50,920
And who loves whom now?

390
00:42:54,315 --> 00:42:56,588
As if you now anything about love.

391
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,643
That is not love, that is...

392
00:43:00,795 --> 00:43:02,299
abuse,

393
00:43:03,062 --> 00:43:04,868
sexual abuse.

394
00:43:06,074 --> 00:43:08,962
You could serve time for this.

395
00:43:09,094 --> 00:43:11,734
You could end up in a mental care unit or in prison.

396
00:43:14,427 --> 00:43:17,319
Maybe this would be better, anyway.

397
00:43:17,063 --> 00:43:18,273
Sven!

398
00:43:20,154 --> 00:43:24,406
Do you really want to feel the impact of this stupid thing for the rest of your life?

399
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,177
Hey, Son.

400
00:43:29,439 --> 00:43:31,367
We will manage to get over this.

401
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:49,634
Promise me that you won't see Patrick again, please?!

402
00:43:49,646 --> 00:43:53,624
His mom will report you, if she sees both of you together again, even just once.

403
00:43:53,623 --> 00:43:56,773
It's your luck, that he has not told her everything.

404
00:43:57,404 --> 00:43:59,181
No more playgrounds.

405
00:43:59,181 --> 00:44:02,284
And no places, where little boys go.

406
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:03,776
Even no more schools?

407
00:44:04,879 --> 00:44:08,418
You've got some nerve. Internet is also banned.

408
00:44:21,636 --> 00:44:23,207
How do I look?

409
00:44:25,076 --> 00:44:29,675
Julia, you look great. It suits you fantastic.

410
00:44:31,648 --> 00:44:33,110
Am I disturbing you?

411
00:44:34,579 --> 00:44:36,050
what has happened?

412
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:41,978
Did he had to fight?

413
00:44:47,074 --> 00:44:49,062
Did you hit him?

414
00:44:51,268 --> 00:44:52,902
what's up?

415
00:44:56,942 --> 00:45:01,545
I think it's better, if we don't see each other for a while.

416
00:45:07,074 --> 00:45:08,573
You're having a laugh?!

417
00:45:10,136 --> 00:45:11,764
Asking me to come here, dressed like this.

418
00:45:11,764 --> 00:45:14,668
It's all too much for me and...

419
00:45:14,668 --> 00:45:16,490
... I need some distance.

420
00:45:20,232 --> 00:45:21,931
You need distance?

421
00:45:22,781 --> 00:45:24,543
Well, yes.

422
00:45:24,497 --> 00:45:27,014
You can't be beaten there...!

423
00:45:28,557 --> 00:45:30,122
Is it because of the boy?

424
00:45:31,192 --> 00:45:33,234
Am I in your way?

425
00:45:35,884 --> 00:45:39,219
I do know what's up with him. I'm not blind.

426
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:41,213
What's up with Sven?

427
00:45:41,256 --> 00:45:43,136
I have seen the booklets.

428
00:45:44,706 --> 00:45:46,843
Achim, that's sick.

429
00:45:47,425 --> 00:45:49,446
I want you to go now.

430
00:46:06,377 --> 00:46:09,067
Did you ever notice, how he turns round for kids?

431
00:46:41,314 --> 00:46:42,648
Everything alright?

432
00:46:54,625 --> 00:46:56,977
They seem to think, that my dad is a millionaire.

433
00:46:56,978 --> 00:46:59,790
Gets me picked up from school by taxi every day.

434
00:47:00,389 --> 00:47:02,732
Your dad, the unknown being?

435
00:47:15,418 --> 00:47:18,012
Mum also had a Christophorus.

436
00:47:18,305 --> 00:47:19,410
Aha?!

437
00:47:34,423 --> 00:47:37,016
Is this supposed to be "venetian red"?

438
00:47:37,016 --> 00:47:37,901
That's what it says.

439
00:47:37,901 --> 00:47:39,910
Looks pink to me.

440
00:47:40,605 --> 00:47:41,922
Piggie pink.

441
00:47:43,824 --> 00:47:45,579
Hey, wasn't meant that way.

442
00:47:47,302 --> 00:47:52,346
You have no idea, how many places I have decorated.

443
00:47:52,365 --> 00:47:54,915
Not a single job was completed.

444
00:47:54,915 --> 00:47:57,071
Says who?

445
00:47:56,793 --> 00:47:58,355
Mum.

446
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:01,444
Your mother...

447
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:07,141
Always the perfectionist. Every cushion and blanket in the right place.

448
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:09,602
We didn't have any blankets.

449
00:48:09,601 --> 00:48:15,431
It's making me sick to see it finished; I always need to have a ladder leaned on the wall.

450
00:48:21,066 --> 00:48:22,543
Dad!

451
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:24,139
Dad?

452
00:48:24,139 --> 00:48:25,986
Must have been a slip.

453
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:28,956
Yes, it just came out.

454
00:48:30,221 --> 00:48:32,523
Someone really got shocked here.

455
00:48:32,558 --> 00:48:34,529
Yes, that's the way.

456
00:48:38,282 --> 00:48:41,203
Don't paint the spot to often, the wallpaper comes off then.

457
00:48:41,202 --> 00:48:42,890
Oops, too late.

458
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,865
Any birthday wishes?

459
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:51,217
Nothing.

460
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:55,552
You will be 18, this has to be celebrated.

461
00:48:56,201 --> 00:48:58,329
I don't want to turn 18.

462
00:49:00,369 --> 00:49:02,445
But I want you to turn 18.

463
00:49:03,754 --> 00:49:06,725
Me, your dad, wants you to turn 18.

464
00:49:07,663 --> 00:49:11,424
And I am sure to have the better arguments here.

465
00:49:31,759 --> 00:49:33,879
what's this now?

466
00:49:33,879 --> 00:49:36,668
Too much stink of paint.

467
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,712
Don't fart under the blanket, okay?

468
00:49:43,156 --> 00:49:45,748
But I have to breath your smoke.

469
00:49:52,601 --> 00:49:53,905
You...

470
00:50:00,035 --> 00:50:02,718
when I was a little boy, ...

471
00:50:02,718 --> 00:50:05,099
... I had a friend.

472
00:50:05,099 --> 00:50:06,855
Who was my age, ...

473
00:50:07,425 --> 00:50:10,074
9 or 10 years old.

474
00:50:10,073 --> 00:50:11,893
I absolutely admired him.

475
00:50:13,162 --> 00:50:15,140
Every time, I thought about him, ...

476
00:50:15,662 --> 00:50:18,403
... my heart has beaten like crazy.

477
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:22,430
And I had to think about him often.

478
00:50:22,406 --> 00:50:24,555
No, not what you are thinking.

479
00:50:25,406 --> 00:50:28,367
It was simple platonic. I just thought him great.

480
00:50:29,009 --> 00:50:31,952
I even remember his house's street name.

481
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:34,552
Brabanter Street.

482
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:37,364
Just admit it, you cherished him.

483
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:39,844
No never.

484
00:50:39,844 --> 00:50:45,318
It was a kiddie thing and everything turned out normal afterwards.

485
00:50:45,577 --> 00:50:47,882
You think that you're normal?

486
00:50:49,299 --> 00:50:51,439
That's not funny.

487
00:50:56,654 --> 00:50:59,871
Did yo ever have sex with a girl?

488
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,630
Why are you asking this now?

489
00:51:04,618 --> 00:51:09,780
Everywhere I look, there are beautiful girls.

490
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:12,517
You're starting to drool.

491
00:51:13,139 --> 00:51:14,895
So, what about Jennifer?

492
00:51:14,895 --> 00:51:16,418
What I am supposed to do with her?

493
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:23,428
Go to the movies, hold hands, show her your stamp collection.

494
00:51:23,428 --> 00:51:25,530
Come on, you know what I mean.

495
00:51:31,306 --> 00:51:32,521
Did you brush your teeth?

496
00:51:33,436 --> 00:51:34,690
Yes.

497
00:51:34,899 --> 00:51:36,287
Did you cur your fingernails?

498
00:51:36,287 --> 00:51:37,413
Yeees.

499
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:40,239
And washed your dick?

500
00:51:41,445 --> 00:51:43,372
And who refuses to grow up here?!

501
00:51:46,225 --> 00:51:47,853
There she is.

502
00:51:55,326 --> 00:51:58,872
She has to be home at 12. Can you drive her?

503
00:51:58,873 --> 00:52:00,692
Let's see.

504
00:52:00,692 --> 00:52:02,363
Just wait.

505
00:52:38,764 --> 00:52:41,844
There is a child molester party in Holland.

506
00:52:41,844 --> 00:52:43,235
who is taking part in the election.

507
00:52:43,236 --> 00:52:47,030
Our own fault, if it all falls to bits.

508
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:48,280
Am I right?

509
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:49,546
Of course.

510
00:52:49,546 --> 00:52:50,431
what's the subject?

511
00:52:50,432 --> 00:52:53,315
Defending the Christian human image.

512
00:52:53,315 --> 00:52:55,021
So you think this is again funny.

513
00:52:55,021 --> 00:52:56,029
Erm, Dieter?

514
00:52:57,707 --> 00:52:59,383
Everything is a joke for you.

515
00:52:59,383 --> 00:53:02,604
Yeees, I just didn't pay attention.

516
00:53:02,604 --> 00:53:04,705
Even if not everybody at the table wants to hear this:

517
00:53:04,705 --> 00:53:08,968
Sexuality is about giving life.

518
00:53:08,968 --> 00:53:12,842
Simply that can only work between male and female.

519
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:17,580
I much prefer a nice boy on my lap than a fat old hen in my arm.

520
00:53:18,801 --> 00:53:23,605
I am telling you now: If such a person would just look at my boy, ...

521
00:53:23,605 --> 00:53:26,648
... I would personally rip his balls off.

522
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:29,897
Yes?

523
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:33,448
Julia, you're not supposed to call me.

524
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:35,824
I'm just going out.

525
00:53:36,892 --> 00:53:38,944
Nevertheless it's preaching.

526
00:53:39,113 --> 00:53:41,714
What for a phone number?

527
00:53:42,766 --> 00:53:45,718
No, I won't right anything down now.

528
00:53:46,843 --> 00:53:50,322
Maybe you will need a therapist, but not us.

529
00:53:51,193 --> 00:53:55,051
Damn it, Julia. I don't want now.

530
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:04,263
"This man is seducing little boys".

531
00:54:27,007 --> 00:54:30,379
Looks like you've had a great time.

532
00:54:38,661 --> 00:54:40,657
Everything allright?

533
00:54:50,587 --> 00:54:52,746
Did he hurt you?

534
00:54:58,906 --> 00:55:01,911
come on, I am driving you home.

535
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:44,417
I was always afraid of it.

536
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:47,383
Pubic hair, that's ...

537
00:55:47,604 --> 00:55:50,172
... that's disgusting.

538
00:55:50,171 --> 00:55:54,648
You just have to totally fall in love, then it doesn't matter any more.

539
00:55:54,649 --> 00:55:56,834
But I did fall in love, really.

540
00:55:56,834 --> 00:55:59,216
it's you who thinks, that I cannot.

541
00:55:59,215 --> 00:56:00,407
Rubbish.

542
00:56:00,407 --> 00:56:02,053
No, that's exactly what you think.

543
00:56:02,053 --> 00:56:05,267
According to you, I don't have feelings.

544
00:56:05,267 --> 00:56:07,169
No, ...

545
00:56:07,169 --> 00:56:11,544
... I just said: Sex without love is not desirable.

546
00:56:11,344 --> 00:56:12,714
For anybody.

547
00:56:12,714 --> 00:56:16,375
Dad, I think you don't want to understand me at all.

548
00:56:18,613 --> 00:56:19,918
Okay,

549
00:56:21,005 --> 00:56:23,335
Explain yourself.

550
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:53,270
This is my darling.

551
00:56:56,755 --> 00:56:59,290
I would like to hug him.

552
00:57:00,524 --> 00:57:01,992
Sven, that's enough.

553
00:57:02,029 --> 00:57:04,657
I love Patrick.

554
00:57:05,671 --> 00:57:08,166
Sometime I imagine to tender him.

555
00:57:09,941 --> 00:57:11,748
How I kiss him.

556
00:57:12,457 --> 00:57:13,719
Stop it.

557
00:57:13,719 --> 00:57:15,361
How I kiss him all over his body.

558
00:57:15,361 --> 00:57:19,046
Damn it, listen, stop it.

559
00:57:19,046 --> 00:57:21,575
I can't hear this bullshit any longer.

560
00:57:30,402 --> 00:57:33,191
I feel love, much love.

561
00:58:15,377 --> 00:58:17,495
"This man is seducing little boys".

562
00:58:36,629 --> 00:58:39,119
Do you want to ask me something?


563
00:58:42,464 --> 00:58:47,320
If I feel the need to ask you anything, ...

564
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:51,281
... then I couldn't live with you any longer.

565
00:58:51,281 --> 00:58:52,886
yes.

566
00:58:54,142 --> 00:58:55,397
We would split up then.

567
00:58:55,397 --> 00:58:57,416
Yeah, I got the message.

568
00:59:00,646 --> 00:59:02,646
"Child molester"

569
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:06,303
corpses can be molested. Do they think, children are corpses?

570
01:00:45,057 --> 01:00:47,595
I can hear you.

571
01:00:51,199 --> 01:00:53,367
I know that you are there.

572
01:01:03,956 --> 01:01:06,885
This guy is so taking advantage of you.

573
01:01:06,884 --> 01:01:09,128
I don't know...

574
01:01:09,164 --> 01:01:12,257
Just have a look at the latest bill.

575
01:01:12,257 --> 01:01:14,420
Do I have to take care of everything?

576
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:16,613
If not you, who else?

577
01:01:16,614 --> 01:01:19,084
Who's the boss here?

578
01:01:19,622 --> 01:01:21,668
You hardly come around here any longer.

579
01:01:25,533 --> 01:01:27,878
I just ran into Julia, by sheer luck.

580
01:01:27,813 --> 01:01:29,676
Coincidence!?

581
01:01:29,676 --> 01:01:31,699
You cannot treat her like this.

582
01:01:31,699 --> 01:01:33,399
can't I?

583
01:01:34,961 --> 01:01:35,897
If the boy has problems...

584
01:01:35,896 --> 01:01:37,391
Just listen to me.

585
01:01:37,391 --> 01:01:42,143
"The boy" is my son, and any problems he has, are my problems, understood?

586
01:01:42,143 --> 01:01:44,589
Obviously not.

587
01:01:44,589 --> 01:01:46,216
Oh shit.

588
01:01:46,216 --> 01:01:49,471
Achim, we have known each other for so long.

589
01:01:49,471 --> 01:01:51,157
We can talk about everything

590
01:01:50,757 --> 01:01:53,443
About what do you want to talk?

591
01:01:54,204 --> 01:01:56,571
Do you think that I am an idiot?

592
01:01:56,571 --> 01:01:58,069
You're the one treating everybody like an idiot!

593
01:01:58,069 --> 01:02:01,478
Please Alf, I have to concentrate, as I need to go to the bank shortly.

594
01:02:01,478 --> 01:02:05,496
Why do you think, I am wearing this *** small tuxedo?

595
01:02:10,776 --> 01:02:14,788
Looks like a from a funeral, doesn't it?

596
01:02:14,788 --> 01:02:17,052
Yes, maybe.

597
01:02:29,655 --> 01:02:31,655
"Report of losses"

598
01:03:00,105 --> 01:03:04,214
I am subject to a sickling revenue, did you know?

599
01:03:05,434 --> 01:03:08,329
Might be contagious, so ...

600
01:03:08,329 --> 01:03:10,355
... keep your distance.

601
01:03:20,367 --> 01:03:22,371
What's the reason of this?

602
01:03:26,175 --> 01:03:28,477
I want you to lock me in.

603
01:03:31,258 --> 01:03:33,241
Did something happen?

604
01:03:33,694 --> 01:03:35,876
Sven?

605
01:03:35,877 --> 01:03:37,406
Nothing.

606
01:03:39,127 --> 01:03:41,116
Why are you doing this then?

607
01:03:44,393 --> 01:03:46,417
It's better this way.

608
01:03:47,942 --> 01:03:50,721
It's better this way?

609
01:03:50,722 --> 01:03:54,078
Do you mean, you can't let out now?

610
01:03:54,983 --> 01:03:57,329
Let's say, I want to prevent similar situations.

611
01:03:57,329 --> 01:04:01,020
Sven, that's down to yourself only.

612
01:04:01,021 --> 01:04:04,733
You can't just lock yourself in for the rest of your life, doing nothing but jacking off.

613
01:04:04,733 --> 01:04:06,019
That's not living.

614
01:04:06,019 --> 01:04:09,793
It's my life, what do you know?

615
01:04:12,814 --> 01:04:15,530
Well, I will not lock you in.

616
01:04:20,437 --> 01:04:23,200
I leave it for others to do then.

617
01:04:23,201 --> 01:04:25,733
I will not let my son get locked away.

618
01:04:25,733 --> 01:04:27,182
Understood?

619
01:04:45,797 --> 01:04:47,720
The taxi is just arriving at the petrol station.

620
01:04:47,719 --> 01:04:50,753
The 4 penguins are all the rear seats, seatbelts fastened.

621
01:04:50,754 --> 01:04:53,069
The clerk spots them and bewildered, he asks: ...

622
01:04:53,069 --> 01:04:56,243
... "What's the big idea with these penguins?"

623
01:04:56,243 --> 01:04:58,626
Taxi driver: " I'm not sure yet myself."

624
01:04:58,627 --> 01:05:00,947
"Just drop them at the zoo." replies the clerk

625
01:05:00,947 --> 01:05:04,223
"Excellent idea." says the driver and drives on.

626
01:05:04,223 --> 01:05:06,632
Next day, he returns...

627
01:05:06,632 --> 01:05:11,786
... again with 4 penguins, who are wearing sunglasses now and the clerk...

628
01:05:18,254 --> 01:05:21,586
All laugh, here comes the freight.

629
01:05:26,312 --> 01:05:29,101
Can you drive me to the hotel, please?

630
01:05:39,983 --> 01:05:42,063
How are you?

631
01:05:43,175 --> 01:05:45,084
And Sven?

632
01:05:46,661 --> 01:05:49,461
Did you consult this therapist?

633
01:05:49,461 --> 01:05:50,132
No.

634
01:05:50,173 --> 01:05:52,437
Why won't you take any advice?

635
01:05:52,437 --> 01:05:53,107
There are possibilities...

636
01:05:53,106 --> 01:05:54,667
For him to be branded?

637
01:05:54,668 --> 01:05:57,596
"Beware paedophile, folks lock your kids away", no way.

638
01:05:59,430 --> 01:06:02,064
No, just to prevent another "Patrick".

639
What happened to him?

640
01:06:03,598 --> 01:06:06,468
Achim, I have checked, advice and help is avail.

641
01:06:06,468 --> 01:06:07,095
They will say that there...

642
01:06:07,094 --> 01:06:09,363
I do know what they will say.

643
01:06:09,363 --> 01:06:12,382
Once a paedophile, always a paedophile

644
01:06:12,382 --> 01:06:13,887
So, what do they want?

645
01:06:15,108 --> 01:06:17,935
And what, if they are able to help him?

646
01:06:17,935 --> 01:06:20,185
For him to prevent harm to himself and the kids.

647
01:06:20,185 --> 01:06:24,848
For him not to think about getting turned on, if a kid smiles at him.

648
01:06:24,848 --> 01:06:26,651
Oh, Achim.

649
01:06:26,651 --> 01:06:29,281
He could learn to deal with his sexual fantasies.

650
01:06:29,281 --> 01:06:31,819
Say, what do you think, am I doing?

651
01:06:31,819 --> 01:06:34,002
Day and night I am helping him to come to terms.

652
01:06:34,002 --> 01:06:35,990
It's a full time job.

653
01:06:39,298 --> 01:06:41,308
I don't get you.

654
01:06:41,593 --> 01:06:43,653
Truly?

655
01:06:45,002 --> 01:06:47,906
I will not have him taken away from me a second time.

656
01:06:48,622 --> 01:06:50,661
Is this so hard to understand?

657
01:06:58,918 --> 01:07:00,972
And how much do I owe you?

658
01:07:03,276 --> 01:07:05,196
It's for free.

659
01:07:22,019 --> 01:07:23,144
Can I enter too?

660
01:07:23,144 --> 01:07:24,638
Just wait.

661
01:07:29,019 --> 01:07:30,139
Now?

662
01:07:30,139 --> 01:07:32,101
One more moment.

663
01:07:33,461 --> 01:07:35,401
You can enter now.

664
01:07:37,447 --> 01:07:43,074
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you.

665
01:07:43,074 --> 01:07:46,536
Happy Birthday dear Sven.

666
01:07:46,536 --> 01:07:47,663
Thanks, that's enough.

667
01:07:47,663 --> 01:07:50,144
Best wishes for your 14th birthday.

668
01:07:52,072 --> 01:07:54,055
Anything wrong?

669
01:07:55,168 --> 01:07:58,149
14th, 15th, 16th, 17th birthday.

670
01:07:59,451 --> 01:08:01,859
Wrong as well.

671
01:08:01,858 --> 01:08:04,040
Oh man, it's easy to get mixed up with you.

672
01:08:04,731 --> 01:08:06,119
Are you drunk?

673
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:10,278
I already toasted with the large number of our guests.

674
01:08:10,278 --> 01:08:12,604
Come on, blow them out.

675
01:08:19,754 --> 01:08:24,008
Hey! don't you remember how this is done?

676
01:08:25,057 --> 01:08:29,420
I'm giving you a gift and you stand right in front of me.

677
01:08:29,419 --> 01:08:31,759
And with a bright sparkle in your eyes, you ask me:

678
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:33,553
Is this for me?

679
01:08:35,831 --> 01:08:39,570
But your eyes did sparkle more in the past.

680
01:08:40,628 --> 01:08:43,084
Come on, unwrap it.

681
01:08:57,394 --> 01:09:01,453
The latest digital gadget.

682
01:09:02,490 --> 01:09:04,415
Get it out of the box.

683
01:09:05,128 --> 01:09:07,100
You have to test it.

684
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:09,047
It won't bite.

685
01:09:12,255 --> 01:09:14,689
what do you want to prove with that?

686
01:09:17,965 --> 01:09:20,459
You do want to prove something with that.

687
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:26,822
You...

688
01:09:26,822 --> 01:09:30,221
... want to prove something for me.

689
01:09:31,134 --> 01:09:33,116
Understood?

690
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:22,019
"Where was that?"

691
01:11:22,019 --> 01:11:27,033
"At Richard Square. To the colleagues nearby: Keep your eyes peeled."

692
01:11:27,234 --> 01:11:30,531
"What does he look like?"

693
01:11:30,531 --> 01:11:36,963
"Young male, trousers, shirt, just like a child molester would look like."

694
01:11:36,963 --> 01:11:39,381
"One is walking down the Passendorfer (street)"

695
01:11:39,380 --> 01:11:42,257

"Are you all set at Rotherstreet?"

696
01:11:42,257 --> 01:11:44,186
"2 1 7 5 receiving?"

697
01:11:45,191 --> 01:11:48,547
"He should walk towards you now."

698
01:11:48,582 --> 01:11:51,382
I dont see anyone."

699
01:11:51,416 --> 01:11:53,449
"Shit, the guy is disappeared."

700
01:11:55,447 --> 01:11:58,697
"He's going towards South Park, just in front of me."

701
01:12:00,856 --> 01:12:04,515
"Now in the Hellersberger (street), he is rushing."

702
01:12:31,653 --> 01:12:32,773
Where is he?

703
01:12:32,773 --> 01:12:34,741
He is not coming out from there.

704
01:12:43,114 --> 01:12:45,007
Achim!

705
01:13:25,608 --> 01:13:27,605
Get up.

706
01:13:28,324 --> 01:13:29,821
Turn around.

707
01:13:32,050 --> 01:13:34,573
Turn around, will you?!

708
01:13:48,870 --> 01:13:49,927
Achim!

709
01:13:54,121 --> 01:13:56,642
Come away! Come away! Come away!

710
01:13:56,842 --> 01:13:59,253
He is one nervous bundle.

711
01:14:55,354 --> 01:14:57,539
You are like a junkie.

712
01:15:00,294 --> 01:15:02,614
Twisted and dishonest.

713
01:15:04,383 --> 01:15:06,898
Never trust a junkie.

714
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:15,386
We did celebrate the leaving do.

715
01:15:20,825 --> 01:15:24,153
Patrick has moved out, we did celebrate the leaving do.

716
01:16:58,222 --> 01:17:00,696
The maid will be here soon.

717
01:17:02,854 --> 01:17:04,711
Clean the room.

718
01:17:13,869 --> 01:17:16,076
I did sell the business.

719
01:17:16,907 --> 01:17:19,640
Otherwise I would have been bankrupt.

720
01:17:21,123 --> 01:17:23,587
Bechler is running it now.

721
01:17:28,814 --> 01:17:31,022
Did he mention anything to you?

722
01:17:34,261 --> 01:17:36,518
Me as an entrepreneur...

723
01:17:38,343 --> 01:17:39,824
... maybe not the right thing for me.

724
01:17:39,825 --> 01:17:41,784
I love you.

725
01:17:46,975 --> 01:17:49,699
I need my freedom.

726
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:51,717
You know what?

727
01:17:54,905 --> 01:17:57,453
Now I am back,...

728
01:17:57,453 --> 01:18:01,090
... where I started 15 years ago.

729
01:18:01,090 --> 01:18:04,659
One man business.

730
01:18:18,689 --> 01:18:20,665
I am almost 40.

731
01:18:22,174 --> 01:18:24,156
You have to make a decision.

732
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:29,917
Achim?

733
01:19:57,491 --> 01:19:59,481
Sven?

734
01:21:03,086 --> 01:21:05,056
Just tell me your name again.

735
01:21:05,248 --> 01:21:07,628
Leon Döring

736
01:21:08,582 --> 01:21:10,262
How old are you?

737
01:21:10,297 --> 01:21:12,069
I will be 11 in September.

738
01:21:12,583 --> 01:21:14,912
Do you know how to make a funny face?

739
01:21:20,845 --> 01:21:22,622
And...

740
01:21:22,691 --> 01:21:24,720
... do you already know, how to kiss?

741
01:21:29,257 --> 01:21:31,253
A real kiss?

742
01:21:33,795 --> 01:21:35,645
Show me.

743
01:21:36,672 --> 01:21:38,717
Kiss the hand.

744
01:22:17,273 --> 01:22:19,268
What has happened?

745
01:22:21,830 --> 01:22:23,762
Did you have a boy here?

746
01:22:25,510 --> 01:22:27,525
Where is he?

747
01:22:27,739 --> 01:22:30,188
Sven, I did ask you something.

748
01:22:30,188 --> 01:22:32,235
Where is the boy?

749
01:22:33,578 --> 01:22:35,554
He ran away.

750
01:22:44,386 --> 01:22:46,360
Come along, let's drive home.

751
01:22:54,576 --> 01:22:59,468
What are you doing? What are you doing?

752
01:23:20,390 --> 01:23:22,373
How about a trip?

753
01:23:24,705 --> 01:23:26,673
Not to Malle or so.

754
01:23:28,354 --> 01:23:30,423
No, a real big trip.

755
01:23:31,187 --> 01:23:33,165
Just the two of us.

756
01:23:33,761 --> 01:23:35,818
In a taxi.

757
01:23:36,608 --> 01:23:38,269
In a taxi...

758
01:23:39,261 --> 01:23:41,266
... all the way to India.

759
01:23:46,186 --> 01:23:48,094
Shortly after my exam,...

760
01:23:48,823 --> 01:23:50,885
... I did hit the road already.

761
01:23:51,828 --> 01:23:55,787
Me and a few pals bought an old VW van back then.

762
01:23:56,114 --> 01:24:00,254
But soon it was over.

763
01:24:01,073 --> 01:24:03,069
The engine broke.

764
01:24:03,842 --> 01:24:06,433
But this won't happen to us, of course.

765
01:24:07,061 --> 01:24:09,176
From Greece...

766
01:24:09,176 --> 01:24:11,645
... over the Bosporus...

767
01:24:11,645 --> 01:24:15,558
... through Turkey, then Iran, ...

768
01:24:15,558 --> 01:24:18,130
...Afghanistan, ...

769
01:24:18,130 --> 01:24:20,489
...Pakistan, ...

770
01:24:20,489 --> 01:24:22,505
... all the way to India.

771
01:24:23,390 --> 01:24:25,364
To Andhra Pradesh (Indian state).

772
01:24:26,517 --> 01:24:29,267
Where the last free tigers roam.

773
01:25:06,164 --> 01:25:08,267
Good evening, Criminal Investigations, Officer Hartmann.

774
01:25:08,267 --> 01:25:10,803
Is Mr. Sven Maas living here?

775
01:25:12,219 --> 01:25:13,193
One moment please.

776
01:25:31,506 --> 01:25:33,481
Sven?

777
01:25:45,116 --> 01:25:47,049
Sven!

778
01:26:37,272 --> 01:26:39,277
I am calling you, when I am ready.

779
01:26:40,229 --> 01:26:42,159
Yes, okay.

780
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:13,962
"Visitor ID"

781
01:27:50,714 --> 01:27:52,252
Thank you.
