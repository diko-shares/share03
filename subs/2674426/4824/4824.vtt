00:00:03,085 --> 00:00:04,532
Previously, on "Freakish"...

2
00:00:04,538 --> 00:00:05,820
That thing killed Noodle.

3
00:00:05,826 --> 00:00:07,460
It ripped him up and it drank his blood.

4
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:08,900
It has to die.

5
00:00:08,906 --> 00:00:11,566
- There's a problem.
- Okay, there are like 100 problems.

6
00:00:11,567 --> 00:00:12,864
Not like this.

7
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,148
- Hey, how much more do you have?
- Less than a day.

8
00:00:15,154 --> 00:00:17,280
He's torturing my sister!

9
00:00:17,281 --> 00:00:20,992
We kept your sister
alive so we could survive.

10
00:00:20,993 --> 00:00:22,802
If it were me in that cage...

11
00:00:23,496 --> 00:00:25,084
I know what I'd want.

12
00:00:25,998 --> 00:00:27,421
I'm so sorry.

13
00:00:39,303 --> 00:00:40,637
Jesus!

14
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,038
Dude, it's just me.

15
00:00:42,044 --> 00:00:45,372
- Yeah, why are you sneaking up on me?
- I'm not "Sneaking up" on anyone.

16
00:00:46,853 --> 00:00:48,372
Whatever. I'll leave.

17
00:00:50,044 --> 00:00:51,244
Wait.

18
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,101
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:55,528 --> 00:00:57,996
I wasn't really expecting
anyone down here.

20
00:01:02,034 --> 00:01:05,407
I just came down here to
see if everything's okay.

21
00:01:06,497 --> 00:01:09,434
She told me to kill her
before she hurt somebody.

22
00:01:13,556 --> 00:01:15,346
Nobody could do that.

23
00:01:15,352 --> 00:01:18,049
We both know there are people
here that could do that.

24
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,760
Barrett's a douche.

25
00:01:23,399 --> 00:01:25,093
I can't let this go on.

26
00:01:28,326 --> 00:01:29,970
Help me end this.

27
00:01:33,998 --> 00:01:37,107
Lost and found is my new
favorite shopping destination.

28
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:39,908
You okay?

29
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:42,701
LeSean?

30
00:01:45,722 --> 00:01:47,214
Can I do anything to help?

31
00:02:14,774 --> 00:02:17,455
LeSean, are you okay?

32
00:02:23,863 --> 00:02:25,522
- What's going on?
- We got to get out of here.

33
00:02:25,527 --> 00:02:27,159
No, won't you tell me what's wrong.

34
00:02:29,334 --> 00:02:30,534
LeSean!

35
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,130
Hey, hey. Hey, LeSean. Stop.

36
00:02:32,136 --> 00:02:33,863
- Stop. Tell me, what's with you?
- Baby, they're inside.

37
00:02:33,868 --> 00:02:35,621
- Who's inside?
- Noodle, the others... they're in here.

38
00:02:35,626 --> 00:02:37,126
- We got to get out!
- Hey!

39
00:02:41,467 --> 00:02:42,852
Did the right thing.

40
00:02:44,971 --> 00:02:46,378
I hope so.

41
00:02:46,644 --> 00:02:47,844
Ah!

42
00:02:49,475 --> 00:02:50,675
I think he's seeing things.

43
00:02:50,681 --> 00:02:51,881
We got to get out!

44
00:02:51,887 --> 00:02:53,270
It's not safe!

45
00:02:55,124 --> 00:02:56,750
He thinks the freaks are in here.

46
00:02:56,756 --> 00:02:59,068
Yeah, there will be freaks
in here if he doesn't stop.

47
00:02:59,074 --> 00:03:01,056
We're gonna die! We
got to get out of here!

48
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:03,689
Go, go! Get him! I got this.

49
00:03:03,695 --> 00:03:05,201
Come on, quick. Give me the board.

50
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:08,524
Come on. Come on, come on, come on.

51
00:03:10,746 --> 00:03:12,794
- Mary is loose again.
- No kidding.

52
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,000
Well...

53
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,715
She was our only chance to learn
more about them, and you let her go.

54
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,417
Maybe you need to take a step back

55
00:03:20,423 --> 00:03:22,814
and let us finish this
before somebody gets hurt.

56
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,696
Are you nuts?

57
00:03:36,001 --> 00:03:37,534
Don't try to stop me.

58
00:03:40,192 --> 00:03:42,027
I can't let you through that door.

60
00:03:55,761 --> 00:03:57,141
Is he okay?

61
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:00,627
I have never messed somebody
up like this, where it lasted.

62
00:04:00,633 --> 00:04:02,360
This isn't from getting punched.

63
00:04:02,446 --> 00:04:05,144
- You can't know that.
- Actually, I can.

64
00:04:05,228 --> 00:04:07,296
- Was he bitten?
- No.

65
00:04:07,302 --> 00:04:10,016
- Or exposed to the air outside?
- He's not changing, stupid.

66
00:04:10,022 --> 00:04:11,674
- I am simply trying...
- Shut up, Barrett.

67
00:04:11,679 --> 00:04:12,899
Guys!

68
00:04:13,195 --> 00:04:16,476
Zoe, if he's not morphing, then
please, tell us what he is doing.

69
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,495
He needs insulin.

70
00:04:21,501 --> 00:04:23,102
He's diabetic?

71
00:04:24,103 --> 00:04:25,722
Oh, my c...

72
00:04:25,728 --> 00:04:28,709
He might have been hallucinating.
That can happen in the later stages.

73
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,129
And you know this how?

74
00:04:30,587 --> 00:04:32,902
I did an anatomy project on diabetes.

75
00:04:32,908 --> 00:04:35,003
He said this can happen
if it gets really bad.

76
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:36,510
Great, just great.

77
00:04:36,516 --> 00:04:38,886
This would've been nice to
know a little bit sooner.

78
00:04:38,887 --> 00:04:41,597
You're one to talk about
informing the group of an issue.

79
00:04:41,598 --> 00:04:44,112
So, he's got how long? One, two days?

80
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:46,495
- More like hours, maybe.
- Don't say that.

81
00:04:46,501 --> 00:04:48,414
There's a thousand
students in this school.

82
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,313
A thousand lockers. Teachers' desks.

83
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:53,428
There's got to be insulin around here
somewhere. We will find it for him.

84
00:04:53,985 --> 00:04:55,735
If we don't, he'll die.

85
00:05:05,997 --> 00:05:07,454
Need any help?

86
00:05:07,569 --> 00:05:08,896
Not from you.

87
00:05:10,252 --> 00:05:12,363
I'm sorry I voted with Barrett.

88
00:05:12,369 --> 00:05:14,675
You voted against Mary.

89
00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:18,202
And someday, I'll explain
why I did what I did.

90
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,987
You know, if you feel so
bad about it, tell me now.

91
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,190
I can't.

92
00:05:23,473 --> 00:05:24,869
Violet, you know Barrett.

93
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,892
He doesn't give a shit
about anyone but himself.

94
00:05:26,898 --> 00:05:29,493
Trust me, I know firsthand
how low Barrett can be.

95
00:05:29,499 --> 00:05:31,204
Yet you decided to vote with him.

96
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,575
- Stop! He made me vote for him.
- Made you?

97
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:36,278
I was there. He didn't
make you do anything.

98
00:05:36,611 --> 00:05:39,777
There are other ways to force
people to do what you want.

99
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,565
So he has something on you.

100
00:05:44,781 --> 00:05:46,890
- I can't say.
- You...

101
00:05:46,896 --> 00:05:49,455
Don't worry about it. I don't know
why I expect anything more from you.

102
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,282
We've known each other less than a week.

103
00:05:51,288 --> 00:05:54,211
You don't owe me anything,
and you didn't know Mary.

104
00:05:54,212 --> 00:05:56,265
Grover, it's not that simple.

105
00:05:56,474 --> 00:05:57,881
It is that simple!

106
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:01,427
You had a choice to protect yourself,
or to let somebody else get hurt.

107
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:03,128
And you chose wrong.

108
00:06:08,894 --> 00:06:10,920
I'm so glad you're feeling better.

109
00:06:12,314 --> 00:06:13,689
I've missed you.

110
00:06:14,455 --> 00:06:15,904
I see.

111
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:21,771
Hey, you want to do this here?

112
00:06:21,777 --> 00:06:23,987
- Absolutely.
- This is a lot.

113
00:06:24,257 --> 00:06:25,664
I know I am.

114
00:06:34,743 --> 00:06:36,726
You should not let her do that.

115
00:06:37,213 --> 00:06:40,237
- Why not?
- Dude, look at her.

116
00:06:52,394 --> 00:06:53,594
Wait.

117
00:06:55,985 --> 00:06:58,354
I got this one. I know the combination.

118
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,381
Well, if it's yours,
why are we checking it?

119
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,501
It's not mine.

120
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:12,791
Look, man, I know this is harsh,

121
00:07:12,797 --> 00:07:15,172
but we don't have time
for a pity party right now.

122
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:20,980
We got to find insulin.

123
00:07:29,302 --> 00:07:32,286
Merry Christmas to me.

124
00:07:35,287 --> 00:07:36,936
We should finish up.

125
00:07:40,688 --> 00:07:42,094
Straight, huh?

126
00:07:44,911 --> 00:07:46,520
To Mary and Lyle.

127
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:53,674
Ugh.

128
00:07:54,347 --> 00:07:57,042
Ah... Lyle would think
that was hilarious.

129
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:59,559
Yeah... so would Mary.

130
00:08:04,939 --> 00:08:06,245
Lay your head back.

131
00:08:07,951 --> 00:08:09,411
You got to save your strength.

132
00:08:10,133 --> 00:08:11,599
We're dying.

133
00:08:11,933 --> 00:08:13,265
Nobody's dying.

134
00:08:24,431 --> 00:08:25,841
You're nurturing.

135
00:08:25,847 --> 00:08:28,360
My boyfriend's sick. Of
course I'm taking care of him.

136
00:08:30,618 --> 00:08:33,330
This is the girls' bathroom.

137
00:08:33,336 --> 00:08:34,630
I know.

138
00:08:34,787 --> 00:08:36,992
If you were doing anything
but getting water for LeSean,

139
00:08:36,998 --> 00:08:38,505
I'd give you your privacy.

140
00:08:38,793 --> 00:08:40,819
You take care of your brothers too.

141
00:08:40,825 --> 00:08:43,630
That's not creepy at all that
you know about my brothers.

142
00:08:43,631 --> 00:08:47,619
You mentioned them in the
lobby after the explosion.

143
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,704
You were worried your mother
wouldn't be able to calm them.

144
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:51,536
Yeah, we're not talking about my family.

145
00:08:53,719 --> 00:08:57,683
Mayday. Can anybody out
there hear me? Mayday.

146
00:09:01,569 --> 00:09:04,659
Mayday. I'm at Kent High School.

147
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:09,105
You startled me.

148
00:09:09,491 --> 00:09:11,401
Doesn't seem to be reaching anyone.

149
00:09:11,701 --> 00:09:14,078
I may have to admit all
I've managed to fabricate

150
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:15,981
is a machine that makes static.

151
00:09:42,565 --> 00:09:44,589
Go, baby, take a little sip.

152
00:09:45,174 --> 00:09:46,374
LeSean?

153
00:09:46,984 --> 00:09:48,259
Hey, wake up.

154
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,596
Hey, hey, stay with me.

155
00:09:53,251 --> 00:09:56,983
Stay with me. Somebody
help! Hey... please...

156
00:09:56,989 --> 00:09:59,759
- What's wrong?
- He's not waking up.

157
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,194
LeSean?

158
00:10:01,751 --> 00:10:03,085
LeSean, come on.

159
00:10:03,086 --> 00:10:04,582
- Wake up.
- What's happening?

160
00:10:04,588 --> 00:10:06,661
He's going into a coma,
which is what happens.

161
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:08,067
Near the end.

162
00:10:08,652 --> 00:10:11,370
It's what happens near the end. Say it.

163
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,666
I'm sorry. I really am.

164
00:10:14,662 --> 00:10:17,066
I can't lose him.

165
00:10:17,655 --> 00:10:19,161
I...

166
00:10:22,395 --> 00:10:25,794
Lyle's mom had diabetes. Lost her foot.

167
00:10:26,413 --> 00:10:27,920
Sounds awful.

168
00:10:30,113 --> 00:10:31,631
You knew him a long time?

169
00:10:32,712 --> 00:10:34,588
Yeah, since we were seven.

170
00:10:36,556 --> 00:10:38,677
His dad used to work at my dad's garage.

171
00:10:39,336 --> 00:10:42,134
Your dad... I can't even
picture Lyle as a kid.

172
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:44,566
Yeah, he was a little shit.

173
00:10:48,952 --> 00:10:50,938
You didn't find anything
on this floor, I take it.

174
00:10:50,944 --> 00:10:53,426
Nope, just a whole bunch of rotten food.

175
00:10:53,647 --> 00:10:56,957
Oh, and the girl who was
into, uh, unicorns likes vodka.

176
00:11:23,837 --> 00:11:25,337
LeSean is getting worse.

177
00:11:25,343 --> 00:11:26,720
Then there's not much time.

178
00:11:27,522 --> 00:11:29,111
Did you find anything?

179
00:11:29,714 --> 00:11:31,614
No. Nothing.

180
00:11:58,514 --> 00:12:00,105
Everything okay?

181
00:12:00,111 --> 00:12:01,311
Yeah.

182
00:12:03,011 --> 00:12:04,515
Mary liked...

183
00:12:05,419 --> 00:12:06,861
likes...

184
00:12:09,421 --> 00:12:10,734
Liked?

185
00:12:11,116 --> 00:12:12,429
Airplanes.

186
00:12:13,322 --> 00:12:14,936
Real ones too?

187
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,557
Thanks. Yeah.

188
00:12:19,329 --> 00:12:21,041
She liked taking trips.

189
00:12:22,058 --> 00:12:24,853
She always wanted a job
where she could travel a lot.

190
00:12:26,341 --> 00:12:27,656
Like a diplomat?

191
00:12:28,296 --> 00:12:29,734
Or a pilot.

192
00:12:30,702 --> 00:12:32,309
Or a salesperson.

193
00:12:33,223 --> 00:12:35,031
Or a professional musician.

194
00:12:35,037 --> 00:12:37,322
And... pro hockey.

195
00:12:40,829 --> 00:12:43,552
She seemed like someone who
could do just about anything.

196
00:12:48,053 --> 00:12:50,129
I'm sorry about what happened.

197
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:56,775
It's weird.

198
00:12:58,471 --> 00:13:01,557
So many people might be dead.

199
00:13:01,563 --> 00:13:05,067
But somehow, thinking of
her as a freak is just...

200
00:13:06,156 --> 00:13:07,991
so much worse.

201
00:13:08,258 --> 00:13:09,544
I get it.

202
00:13:11,648 --> 00:13:13,971
I can't even picture Addy like that.

203
00:13:14,976 --> 00:13:16,969
I mean, they're not dead, but...

204
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,534
they're not gone, either.

205
00:13:21,823 --> 00:13:23,864
I keep hoping there's a cure.

206
00:13:27,635 --> 00:13:28,962
Me too.

207
00:13:42,117 --> 00:13:44,051
He'll need more soon enough.

208
00:14:09,801 --> 00:14:11,188
You going outside?

209
00:14:11,602 --> 00:14:13,207
I want to feel the air.

210
00:14:13,213 --> 00:14:16,000
You got to open the doors to go outside.

211
00:14:16,006 --> 00:14:19,012
I know. Can't stay in here.

212
00:14:19,081 --> 00:14:21,188
Go ahead. Try and get out.

213
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:36,517
His heartbeat's really weak.

214
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:39,420
I'm gonna go check the gym lockers.

215
00:14:39,426 --> 00:14:41,135
Natalie and Violet already did that.

216
00:14:41,141 --> 00:14:42,692
Then I'm gonna go check
the nurse's office.

217
00:14:42,697 --> 00:14:43,915
We know there's none there.

218
00:14:43,921 --> 00:14:45,750
Okay, then I'm going
outside to a drug store.

219
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:48,234
I understand why you're
upset, but acting impetuously

220
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,409
- solves nothing.
- I can't just do nothing.

221
00:14:51,513 --> 00:14:52,713
Hey.

222
00:14:53,002 --> 00:14:54,420
This isn't necessary.

223
00:14:56,091 --> 00:14:58,484
My point is, you don't
have to search for insulin.

224
00:14:58,762 --> 00:15:01,969
Oh, my God. Oh, that's so great.
Where... where'd you find it?

225
00:15:01,975 --> 00:15:03,479
Principal Mitchell's office.

226
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:04,985
Why didn't you say something sooner?

227
00:15:04,991 --> 00:15:07,265
I wanted to tell you when we were alone.

228
00:15:07,561 --> 00:15:09,562
I... I don't understand.

229
00:15:09,851 --> 00:15:12,236
There isn't really
anything to understand.

230
00:15:15,935 --> 00:15:18,346
- What do you want for it?
- Excuse me?

231
00:15:18,352 --> 00:15:20,831
What do you want for it?

232
00:15:21,424 --> 00:15:22,729
A "Thank you" will do.

233
00:15:22,735 --> 00:15:24,527
How am I supposed to thank you?

234
00:15:25,922 --> 00:15:27,738
I must admit, I'm a bit taken aback.

235
00:15:27,744 --> 00:15:29,325
Dude, just answer the question?

236
00:15:29,331 --> 00:15:31,136
I don't know if your
reaction is a reflection

237
00:15:31,142 --> 00:15:33,486
on how you see me, or you see yourself.

238
00:15:33,492 --> 00:15:35,713
- Either way, it's distressing.
- Stop talking like that

239
00:15:35,719 --> 00:15:37,127
and just give me the pen.

240
00:15:39,213 --> 00:15:41,042
I knew you didn't care for me.

241
00:15:42,119 --> 00:15:44,885
But to think me capable
of taking advantage of you,

242
00:15:44,891 --> 00:15:48,724
or for you to see yourself as something
to be bartered, like an object,

243
00:15:49,589 --> 00:15:51,980
I think you're
underestimating both of us.

244
00:15:51,986 --> 00:15:53,988
All I wanted was to help you and LeSean.

245
00:16:00,508 --> 00:16:01,798
Thank you.

246
00:16:02,314 --> 00:16:03,892
Go help your boyfriend.

247
00:16:21,862 --> 00:16:23,309
Hey.

248
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,004
I was worried.

249
00:16:29,513 --> 00:16:31,496
I thought I lost you.

250
00:16:39,412 --> 00:16:43,291
I give you warm canned cheese.

251
00:16:43,297 --> 00:16:45,080
- Ooh.
- Oh, that's my favorite.

252
00:16:45,086 --> 00:16:47,063
- And chips.
- Chips?

253
00:16:47,069 --> 00:16:49,152
- I improvised.
- All right.

254
00:16:55,957 --> 00:16:57,249
- Pretty good.
- I mean,

255
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,667
best waffle chip I ever had.

256
00:16:58,668 --> 00:17:01,270
I brought a little something extra.

257
00:17:01,276 --> 00:17:04,575
- Ooh, nice.
- Hey. Thank you, Diesel.

258
00:17:04,581 --> 00:17:06,675
Don't thank me. Thank the unicorn chick.

259
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:19,723
- I'd like to make a toast.
- Here, here.

260
00:17:20,227 --> 00:17:21,656
To Barrett.

261
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:25,227
You and I haven't
always seen eye-to-eye.

262
00:17:25,233 --> 00:17:27,505
I decided I didn't like
you before I knew you.

263
00:17:27,511 --> 00:17:29,022
You and me both.

264
00:17:29,193 --> 00:17:30,945
But I owe you my life.

265
00:17:32,222 --> 00:17:33,499
Thank you.

266
00:17:35,186 --> 00:17:36,389
To Barrett.

267
00:17:36,395 --> 00:17:38,222
- To Barrett.
- To Barrett.

268
00:17:39,294 --> 00:17:41,420
I would also like to make a toast.

269
00:17:43,592 --> 00:17:45,405
To everybody who we've lost.

270
00:17:47,303 --> 00:17:48,649
Mary.

271
00:17:49,107 --> 00:17:50,451
Lyle.

272
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,002
Noodle.

273
00:17:52,228 --> 00:17:53,488
Addy.

274
00:17:54,537 --> 00:17:55,933
And all the others.

275
00:18:10,304 --> 00:18:13,422
One thing about being stuck here

276
00:18:13,974 --> 00:18:15,983
is that there's no normal.

277
00:18:16,474 --> 00:18:18,377
There are no funerals.

278
00:18:18,979 --> 00:18:20,462
No memorials.

279
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,933
But we will do right by them.

280
00:18:25,822 --> 00:18:28,432
And we will remember them.

281
00:19:13,227 --> 00:19:15,454
My brothers are four years old.

282
00:19:17,538 --> 00:19:18,761
Cute age.

283
00:19:18,767 --> 00:19:20,278
You like kids?

284
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,744
They're interesting.

285
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,546
They see the world completely new.

286
00:19:27,663 --> 00:19:30,841
When my brother Patrick
first felt rain, he...

287
00:19:30,842 --> 00:19:32,260
Completely freaked out.

288
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,180
He thought angels were
crying or something like that?

289
00:19:36,181 --> 00:19:39,100
He thought it wasn't gonna stop,
and we were all gonna drown.

290
00:19:39,101 --> 00:19:40,332
See?

291
00:19:40,686 --> 00:19:42,013
Interesting.

292
00:19:43,672 --> 00:19:44,885
Right.

293
00:19:45,098 --> 00:19:46,520
Um...

294
00:19:47,973 --> 00:19:49,799
I'm gonna go check on LeSean.

295
00:19:58,245 --> 00:20:01,264
So where did you find this insulin?

296
00:20:01,373 --> 00:20:03,195
In Principal Mitchell's fridge.

297
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:04,421
Really?

298
00:20:04,427 --> 00:20:07,545
You didn't tell me you found
anything when you were in his office.

299
00:20:07,546 --> 00:20:09,505
I hadn't when I talked to you.

300
00:20:09,506 --> 00:20:11,704
Well, thank God you did.

301
00:20:30,873 --> 00:20:32,156
Stop it.

302
00:20:32,162 --> 00:20:33,860
- You'd like a nice, tight, two-shot?
- No!

303
00:20:35,365 --> 00:20:36,858
- Hmm?
- No!

304
00:20:38,584 --> 00:20:40,694
I need to apologize to you guys.

305
00:20:41,693 --> 00:20:42,904
Yeah?

306
00:20:45,876 --> 00:20:49,701
I'm sorry that I didn't tell
anybody that Mary was bitten.

307
00:20:51,923 --> 00:20:54,821
I don't really know if I knew
she was gonna turn into a freak,

308
00:20:54,827 --> 00:20:56,407
and I didn't want to admit it,

309
00:20:57,508 --> 00:21:00,390
or I just hoped she wouldn't, and...

310
00:21:00,396 --> 00:21:02,812
if I didn't say anything,
it would all get better.

311
00:21:02,818 --> 00:21:04,399
I get that.

312
00:21:08,815 --> 00:21:11,818
I'm so sorry about what
she did to Noodle, man.

313
00:21:11,943 --> 00:21:13,607
That's not your fault.

314
00:21:16,918 --> 00:21:18,544
Guys, we got a problem.

315
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,831
Oh, God. What?

316
00:21:19,837 --> 00:21:21,222
The water's out.

317
00:21:22,731 --> 00:21:23,983
Everywhere.

318
