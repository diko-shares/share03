1
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.495
Huh?

2
00:01:29.715 --> 00:01:31.758
Whoa.

3
00:01:32.426 --> 00:01:36.471
Come on, Sally. I can't be late.
I'm the one who scheduled this practice.

4
00:01:36.555 --> 00:01:38.390
Right behind you, big brother.

5
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.564
Whoops. Heads up!

6
00:01:45.647 --> 00:01:47.316
Good morning, Charlie Brown.

7
00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.527
Good morning, Linus, Lucy.
Are you ready for today's practice?

8
00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:54.114
Why do we even bother with practice?
We never win any games.

9
00:01:54.198 --> 00:01:56.658
That's exactly why. I'm tired of losing.

10
00:01:56.742 --> 00:01:58.535
Look at it this way, Charlie Brown,

11
00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.580
we learn more from losing
than we do from winning.

12
00:02:01.663 --> 00:02:04.750
That must make me
the smartest person in the world.

13
00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:08.503
Aren't you going to say good morning
to me, my Sweet Babboo?

14
00:02:08.586 --> 00:02:10.839
I'm not your Sweet Babboo!

15
00:02:10.923 --> 00:02:12.758
What's the plan, Charlie Brown?

16
00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:15.928
New uniforms? New playbook?
A new quarterback?

17
00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:18.055
No, a new coach.

18
00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:21.558
Hmm. Maybe you're not such
a blockhead after all.

19
00:02:33.278 --> 00:02:35.322
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, Marcie.

20
00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:37.115
I've been reading up on football.

21
00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:40.160
I'm ready to get out there
and kick around the old hogskin.

22
00:02:40.244 --> 00:02:43.580
It's pigskin, Marcie.
And everything isn't "old" in football.

23
00:02:43.664 --> 00:02:44.915
Whatever you say, sir.

24
00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:47.876
And don't call me "sir."
Today it's "Coach."

25
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.211
All right, listen up.

26
00:02:51.755 --> 00:02:52.965
- Chuck here…
- Ah.

27
00:02:53.048 --> 00:02:57.052
…has asked me to help his team
get in shape for next season.

28
00:02:57.135 --> 00:02:59.429
Nothing like a good challenge.

29
00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:02.474
Ready to get to work? Good.

30
00:03:02.558 --> 00:03:05.561
I like to start my warm-ups
with 100 jumping jacks.

31
00:03:05.644 --> 00:03:06.770
Marcie?

32
00:03:06.854 --> 00:03:10.315
You heard her. Jump!

33
00:03:10.816 --> 00:03:14.027
One, two, three…

34
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:19.867
…four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

35
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.910
11, 12, 13…

36
00:03:21.994 --> 00:03:25.539
- Sorry I'm late, Coach.
- Hope you have a good excuse, Pigpen.

37
00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:33.964
I do. The line at the candy store sure was
backed up due to Mother's Day tomorrow.

38
00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:36.300
What?

39
00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:40.012
That's tomorrow? I can't believe
I almost forgot Mother's Day.

40
00:03:40.095 --> 00:03:42.306
Mother's Day?
Mother's Day is special.

41
00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:43.807
Cut the chitchat, Chuck.

42
00:03:43.891 --> 00:03:45.267
Marcie, where were we?

43
00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.561
I, uh... I lost count.

44
00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:49.104
Oh, forget it.

45
00:03:49.188 --> 00:03:52.482
Time for a little demonstration.
What you're about to see

46
00:03:52.566 --> 00:03:56.570
is some real down-in-the-dirt,
slam-bang, rock-'em-sock-'em football.

47
00:03:56.653 --> 00:03:57.946
Marcie, bring 'em in.

48
00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:05.078
Keep your eyes
on the kid with the funny nose.

49
00:04:05.162 --> 00:04:07.122
Look at those moves.

50
00:04:07.206 --> 00:04:09.166
Okay, kid. Enough with the moves.

51
00:04:12.753 --> 00:04:14.505
Let's start with a simple kick.

52
00:04:14.588 --> 00:04:16.005
All right, tee it up!

53
00:04:23.764 --> 00:04:25.390
Uh, nice hit, little guy.

54
00:04:25.474 --> 00:04:29.144
Shake it off. Forget the kick.
Let's do the passing play.

55
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.733
I never know what my mother would like.
You're clever, Linus. What are you doing?

56
00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:38.487
Well, every day my mom puts
these little notes in my lunch sack,

57
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:39.696
just like this one.

58
00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:43.659
"Dear Son, study hard.

59
00:04:43.742 --> 00:04:45.994
Remember, all you need
to find true happiness

60
00:04:46.078 --> 00:04:47.746
is already there within you.

61
00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:50.415
The lunch is just a bonus. Love, Mom."

62
00:04:51.375 --> 00:04:53.210
She gets carried away sometimes.

63
00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:55.587
Now go straight out and cut right.

64
00:04:56.713 --> 00:04:58.632
Now left. Now cut back.

65
00:05:03.345 --> 00:05:06.682
Don't come back.
It's a pass, not a return.

66
00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:10.561
This year, I decided to write
a special letter back to thank her.

67
00:05:10.644 --> 00:05:13.564
Unfortunately,
I still need to figure out what to say.

68
00:05:13.647 --> 00:05:16.191
Writing is not really my strong suit.

69
00:05:16.275 --> 00:05:20.988
"Roses are...
Violets are"...

70
00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:24.283
This isn't the play! Tackle that guy.

71
00:05:24.366 --> 00:05:26.034
Can he even hear me?

72
00:05:26.618 --> 00:05:28.412
What are you guys doing?

73
00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:32.541
I'm making Mom a gift
that will be a true artistic masterpiece.

74
00:05:32.624 --> 00:05:34.168
Oh, really? What's that?

75
00:05:34.251 --> 00:05:36.044
If I knew, I'd tell you!

76
00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:40.424
- What are you getting your mom?
- She's been really nice lately,

77
00:05:40.507 --> 00:05:44.136
so I upped her gift
to a crisp five-dollar bill.

78
00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:45.721
How thoughtful of you.

79
00:05:45.804 --> 00:05:47.139
Cold, hard cash.

80
00:05:47.222 --> 00:05:49.474
You don't have the ball.

81
00:05:50.184 --> 00:05:52.144
I'm writing a sonata for my mom.

82
00:05:52.227 --> 00:05:56.148
I call it, "You're the Best Mom,"
in F major.

83
00:05:56.231 --> 00:05:57.399
My mom loves hugs,

84
00:05:57.482 --> 00:06:00.110
so I'm making her
a coupon book full of them.

85
00:06:00.194 --> 00:06:02.821
Stop! Look behind you.

86
00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:11.330
Not bad
for a little guy. Run! Go, go go!

87
00:06:14.416 --> 00:06:16.919
Yeah! Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

88
00:06:17.002 --> 00:06:19.671
Not pretty, but it's a touchdown!

89
00:06:19.755 --> 00:06:22.090
Did you get all… that?

90
00:06:22.174 --> 00:06:23.759
- Mother's Day.
- Happy Mother's Day.

91
00:06:23.842 --> 00:06:25.135
Isn't Mother's Day the best?

92
00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:27.346
- Happy Mother's Day.
- I love Mother's Day.

93
00:06:31.558 --> 00:06:33.060
May I have your attention?

94
00:06:33.644 --> 00:06:37.064
Unless you all have something better
you'd rather be doing?

95
00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.527
Actually, I need to go
to the craft store for art supplies.

96
00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.070
I need to make more coupons.

97
00:06:43.153 --> 00:06:45.781
I still have to work on the last movement
of my sonata.

98
00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:48.825
A card would go nicely
with my box of chocolates.

99
00:06:49.368 --> 00:06:51.203
I should be writing my letter.

100
00:06:52.871 --> 00:06:57.000
Sorry, Coach. I should go too.

101
00:06:57.084 --> 00:06:59.628
I'll call you to set up
another practice soon.

102
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.007
All right, go ahead and leave.

103
00:07:04.091 --> 00:07:06.760
But don't blame me
when you lose next season.

104
00:07:13.016 --> 00:07:16.228
At least someone isn't distracted
by stupid Mother's Day.

105
00:07:18.313 --> 00:07:19.314
Huh?

106
00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:25.237
You too? Everyone deserted me. Ugh.

107
00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.531
Not everyone, Coach. Sir.

108
00:09:18.433 --> 00:09:19.643
Hmm.

109
00:09:23.438 --> 00:09:24.439
Ooh!

110
00:09:28.777 --> 00:09:30.404
Huh?

111
00:09:47.462 --> 00:09:49.256
Now, here's the sneaky part.

112
00:09:49.339 --> 00:09:52.759
I turn back and do a fake-o pass
to the running back.

113
00:09:52.843 --> 00:09:55.137
But then I keep the ball to myself,

114
00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.973
do a few tricky moves
to avoid the other side,

115
00:09:58.056 --> 00:10:00.934
and run down the field for a touchdown.

116
00:10:01.018 --> 00:10:02.227
Sir…

117
00:10:02.311 --> 00:10:05.772
This is all very interesting, sir,

118
00:10:05.856 --> 00:10:08.692
but maybe we should do this
when the other players are here.

119
00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:13.363
No. I refuse to change my plans
just because of Mother's Day.

120
00:10:13.447 --> 00:10:16.450
Maybe we could find something else
that's fun to do.

121
00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:18.493
Who says I'm not having fun?

122
00:10:18.577 --> 00:10:21.955
Is this the face of a person
not having fun?

123
00:10:24.166 --> 00:10:26.668
- Do you want to talk about it, sir?
- No.

124
00:10:33.217 --> 00:10:36.011
Sir, I'm really sorry
you don't have a mom.

125
00:10:36.094 --> 00:10:39.014
I just don't understand
why Mother's Day's such a big deal.

126
00:10:39.097 --> 00:10:41.391
Mother's Day is… dumb!

127
00:10:51.318 --> 00:10:54.988
It's nice that we've opened up
this line of communication, sir.

128
00:11:10.629 --> 00:11:12.548
You should just go home, Marcie.

129
00:11:12.631 --> 00:11:15.634
I'm sure you have some things
you need to prepare for tomorrow.

130
00:11:15.717 --> 00:11:19.096
Taken care of, sir. I made cupcakes.

131
00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:21.265
I would rather stay here with you.

132
00:11:23.475 --> 00:11:25.435
It's the same every year.

133
00:11:25.519 --> 00:11:29.523
I'm having a good day,
and then someone brings up Mother's Day.

134
00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:33.986
And suddenly I'm reminded that
I'm the only kid who doesn't have a mom.

135
00:11:34.653 --> 00:11:36.780
It must be difficult, sir.

136
00:11:36.864 --> 00:11:38.490
It really is, Marcie.

137
00:11:46.957 --> 00:11:48.917
Last year, I pretended to be sick

138
00:11:49.001 --> 00:11:51.253
so I didn't have to go
to school that week.

139
00:11:51.336 --> 00:11:54.673
I remember. You came down
with a case of the yuckies.

140
00:11:57.885 --> 00:12:00.888
If you want,
you can spend Mother's Day at my house.

141
00:12:00.971 --> 00:12:02.639
I don't mind sharing my mom.

142
00:12:03.307 --> 00:12:06.727
Your mom's nice,
but it's just not the same.

143
00:12:07.227 --> 00:12:09.313
Is there anything I can do to help?

144
00:12:11.106 --> 00:12:12.357
I don't know, Marcie.

145
00:12:12.441 --> 00:12:16.028
Can you make Mother's Day go away
and never come back again?

146
00:12:16.111 --> 00:12:18.739
Uh, I'm afraid not, sir.

147
00:12:19.448 --> 00:12:21.033
I didn't think so.

148
00:12:25.162 --> 00:12:27.122
Let's go return Chuck's football.

149
00:12:29.416 --> 00:12:32.753
"To my mom." Hmm. No.

150
00:12:33.295 --> 00:12:37.716
"Mommy dearest." Uh, no.

151
00:12:38.383 --> 00:12:41.470
"O mother of mine."

152
00:12:43.305 --> 00:12:45.432
"Hey, Mom."

153
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:48.227
Letter writing is a lost art.

154
00:12:49.853 --> 00:12:50.854
"Mother."

155
00:12:51.355 --> 00:12:53.065
- Move over, Linus.
- Wha... Uh?

156
00:12:53.148 --> 00:12:56.443
I need the table to make
my special Mother's Day present.

157
00:13:02.074 --> 00:13:05.410
It's going to be a portrait of Mom
done in watercolor.

158
00:13:05.494 --> 00:13:07.996
She's going to take one look at it
and say,

159
00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:10.707
"That picture belongs
at the top of the fridge."

160
00:13:10.791 --> 00:13:12.501
Sounds like a great idea.

161
00:13:12.584 --> 00:13:15.254
I believe the best gifts
come from the heart.

162
00:13:15.337 --> 00:13:18.131
Heart, schmeart. This is art.

163
00:13:18.632 --> 00:13:24.179
Being a great artist means
having discipline, concentration,

164
00:13:24.263 --> 00:13:27.349
and never rushing your masterpiece.

165
00:13:27.432 --> 00:13:28.684
Done!

166
00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:33.021
Uh, have you looked at Mom recently?

167
00:13:36.191 --> 00:13:40.612
I think I'll make something else.
Something inspired.

168
00:13:40.696 --> 00:13:45.117
Whew. There's a fine line
between honest and too honest.

169
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:49.872
Aren't you going to ring the doorbell?

170
00:13:49.955 --> 00:13:51.707
I don't want to see anybody.

171
00:13:52.708 --> 00:13:55.586
Do you want to borrow my handkerchief?

172
00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:59.214
I'm not crying, I'm thinking.

173
00:13:59.298 --> 00:14:02.426
They sort of look like
the same thing sometimes.

174
00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:04.678
Well, it's here if you want it.

175
00:14:07.764 --> 00:14:11.101
I don't know why I get so upset.

176
00:14:11.685 --> 00:14:13.854
Maybe because you miss your mom?

177
00:14:13.937 --> 00:14:16.940
I never had a mom. How could I miss her?

178
00:14:17.608 --> 00:14:19.943
Well, maybe you miss what moms do,

179
00:14:20.027 --> 00:14:22.070
like making your favorite cookies

180
00:14:22.154 --> 00:14:24.656
and putting a bandage on your finger
when you have a cut

181
00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:26.200
and singing your favorite song?

182
00:14:26.283 --> 00:14:27.618
I don't miss those things.

183
00:14:27.701 --> 00:14:32.664
My dad does all that mom stuff for me.
He's the best.

184
00:14:32.748 --> 00:14:34.499
Your dad is very nice.

185
00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:37.461
Are you okay, sir?

186
00:14:38.003 --> 00:14:41.256
Marcie,
there are all types of moms, right?

187
00:14:41.798 --> 00:14:44.593
Of course. Foster kids have terrific moms.

188
00:14:44.676 --> 00:14:48.180
So do adopted kids.
Some kids even have two moms.

189
00:14:48.263 --> 00:14:53.560
Right. And even kids like me, with no mom,
can have someone who acts like a mom.

190
00:14:54.144 --> 00:14:57.898
And all those moms deserve
to be celebrated, don't you think?

191
00:14:57.981 --> 00:14:59.233
Sure they do.

192
00:14:59.733 --> 00:15:01.610
Well, that's what I'm gonna do.

193
00:15:01.693 --> 00:15:04.738
For Mother's Day,
I'm going to celebrate my dad.

194
00:15:04.821 --> 00:15:06.198
It's so simple.

195
00:15:06.281 --> 00:15:09.826
All I have to do is get him
one of those Mother's Day gifts.

196
00:15:11.787 --> 00:15:12.996
Like a card?

197
00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.707
Yes, that's it! A card!

198
00:15:15.791 --> 00:15:20.128
I get him a card. And bang!
No more yuckies. Problem solved.

199
00:15:20.212 --> 00:15:22.589
Marcie, you're a genius!

200
00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:24.091
I am?

201
00:15:30.138 --> 00:15:33.016
I can't believe
it's already Mother's Day tomorrow.

202
00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:35.644
Wasn't it just Mother's Day last year?

203
00:15:35.727 --> 00:15:37.354
It happens every year.

204
00:15:37.437 --> 00:15:40.983
But stay focused, Sally.
We need to think of a special gift.

205
00:15:42.025 --> 00:15:44.444
Hmm.

206
00:15:45.696 --> 00:15:47.239
Mmm.

207
00:15:56.081 --> 00:15:59.084
Sally, I think I have a plan.

208
00:15:59.168 --> 00:16:01.587
What does Mom always say
is her favorite meal?

209
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:03.505
The one she doesn't have to cook.

210
00:16:03.589 --> 00:16:04.631
Exactly.

211
00:16:04.715 --> 00:16:08.468
Well, tomorrow we're going to
make her breakfast in bed.

212
00:16:08.552 --> 00:16:10.596
Won't that make her sheets soggy?

213
00:16:10.679 --> 00:16:15.184
I don't think you understand
the finer details of breakfast in bed.

214
00:16:15.267 --> 00:16:18.395
It's served on a tray,
and it's very classy.

215
00:16:18.478 --> 00:16:20.105
It sounds messy to me.

216
00:16:20.189 --> 00:16:22.524
Trust me, she's going to love it.

217
00:16:22.608 --> 00:16:24.693
But we should do a test run first.

218
00:16:24.776 --> 00:16:27.446
Bring me the good plates
from the china cabinet.

219
00:16:27.529 --> 00:16:29.239
Aye, aye, big brother.

220
00:16:33.493 --> 00:16:35.037
Hmm.

221
00:16:43.003 --> 00:16:44.129
Ooh.

222
00:16:52.304 --> 00:16:54.014
Whoa.

223
00:16:55.682 --> 00:16:57.851
Whoa. Whoa!

224
00:16:58.727 --> 00:17:01.104
Whoa.

225
00:17:05.776 --> 00:17:08.028
Wha... Huh?

226
00:17:14.159 --> 00:17:17.496
I thought you said
breakfast in bed wasn't messy.

227
00:17:19.665 --> 00:17:21.165
Good grief.

228
00:17:31.969 --> 00:17:33.428
Uh-huh.

229
00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:39.393
Nuh-uh.

230
00:17:39.476 --> 00:17:40.686
Hmm.

231
00:19:55.988 --> 00:19:59.491
Hmm?

232
00:20:15.632 --> 00:20:17.885
We have arrived. All right.

233
00:20:17.968 --> 00:20:20.220
We're looking for a Mother's Day card
that says,

234
00:20:20.304 --> 00:20:23.015
"Thanks, Dad,
for being such a good mother."

235
00:20:23.098 --> 00:20:25.601
That sounds… logical.

236
00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:30.355
"Dear Mother,
your smile brightens my day." No.

237
00:20:30.439 --> 00:20:32.941
"Dear Mother, my love for you"...

238
00:20:33.984 --> 00:20:37.404
"To a mother sweeter than sugar."
Not that one either.

239
00:20:37.487 --> 00:20:39.698
Where are the Mother's Day cards
he'd like?

240
00:20:39.781 --> 00:20:43.452
Some trucks or sports
or a little bit of flannel?

241
00:20:43.535 --> 00:20:45.996
These are all flowery and mushy.

242
00:20:46.079 --> 00:20:48.624
"Mother, O Mother!" Oh, brother.

243
00:20:48.707 --> 00:20:50.375
No. Never. Nope.

244
00:20:55.714 --> 00:20:58.926
I don't believe it.
There's nothing here for my dad.

245
00:20:59.009 --> 00:21:00.594
Have you seen any cards that say,

246
00:21:00.677 --> 00:21:03.764
"Happy Mother's Day
to the world's greatest grandma"?

247
00:21:03.847 --> 00:21:07.226
I want one that's short and sweet,
just like her.

248
00:21:07.309 --> 00:21:09.228
Good luck with that.

249
00:21:11.688 --> 00:21:14.525
"There is no other like my grandmother.

250
00:21:14.608 --> 00:21:17.861
Happy Mother's Day
to the world's greatest grandma."

251
00:21:17.945 --> 00:21:19.696
- This is perfect.
- Huh?

252
00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:22.407
Thank you. Oh, Marcie.

253
00:21:24.493 --> 00:21:25.827
Excuse me.

254
00:21:25.911 --> 00:21:29.665
Can you show me where I can find
a Mother's Day card for my father?

255
00:21:32.167 --> 00:21:34.753
Well, you should expand
your card selection.

256
00:21:34.837 --> 00:21:38.632
Not everyone has the same sort
of family, you know. Sheesh.

257
00:21:39.341 --> 00:21:40.384
Marcie.

258
00:21:41.885 --> 00:21:43.053
Sorry.

259
00:21:44.429 --> 00:21:45.430
Come on.

260
00:21:46.306 --> 00:21:47.474
I refuse to give up.

261
00:21:48.016 --> 00:21:49.017
Let's go.

262
00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:51.895
What about ice skates?

263
00:21:51.979 --> 00:21:53.105
He has weak ankles.

264
00:21:53.188 --> 00:21:55.649
- What about flowers?
- He has allergies.

265
00:21:55.732 --> 00:21:59.611
- Some jewelry?
- Nice, but too expensive.

266
00:21:59.695 --> 00:22:00.696
How about a cake?

267
00:22:00.779 --> 00:22:03.031
He's more of a salty kind of guy.

268
00:22:03.115 --> 00:22:04.408
A day of pampering?

269
00:22:04.491 --> 00:22:05.951
He hates cucumber.

270
00:22:10.205 --> 00:22:11.582
Write him a song?

271
00:22:11.665 --> 00:22:15.586
I give up. This is impossible.

272
00:22:20.966 --> 00:22:22.176
Hmm?

273
00:22:36.064 --> 00:22:37.149
Aw.

274
00:22:37.691 --> 00:22:38.692
Hmm.

275
00:23:04.635 --> 00:23:06.720
Whoo-hoo!

276
00:23:16.396 --> 00:23:17.773
Aha!

277
00:23:22.152 --> 00:23:23.153
Huh?

278
00:23:35.207 --> 00:23:36.542
Mmm.

279
00:24:06.572 --> 00:24:08.198
Huh?

280
00:24:49.448 --> 00:24:52.826
Don't you think cleaning up the kitchen
counts as a gift?

281
00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:55.787
We're running out of time.
Let's keep looking.

282
00:24:58.248 --> 00:25:00.375
How about an ice cream cake?

283
00:25:02.252 --> 00:25:04.713
Actually, that's not a bad idea.

284
00:25:10.177 --> 00:25:12.721
One ice cream cake, please.

285
00:25:12.804 --> 00:25:14.598
Um…

286
00:25:14.681 --> 00:25:16.141
- Strawberry.
- Strawberry.

287
00:25:16.225 --> 00:25:18.185
Make it, um…

288
00:25:18.268 --> 00:25:19.978
- Large.
- Large, please.

289
00:25:22.314 --> 00:25:23.440
Uh…

290
00:25:24.107 --> 00:25:28.070
Sally, I'm a little short.
Do you have any money?

291
00:25:29.404 --> 00:25:31.990
From one mess to another.

292
00:25:36.787 --> 00:25:39.998
You know, Mother's Day is just
another commercial scam.

293
00:25:40.082 --> 00:25:42.459
Thank you, sir.

294
00:25:43.085 --> 00:25:46.797
Should I assume you won't be eating
any of this commercial scam?

295
00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:48.465
Ah, of course I will.

296
00:25:48.549 --> 00:25:52.511
When ice cream is involved,
my principles are totally negotiable.

297
00:26:01.854 --> 00:26:05.732
I suppose you're wondering
where I got this beautiful crown.

298
00:26:05.816 --> 00:26:07.276
It certainly crossed my mind.

299
00:26:07.359 --> 00:26:09.319
I made it to give to my mom tomorrow,

300
00:26:09.403 --> 00:26:12.197
so she can feel what it's like
to be queen for a day.

301
00:26:12.281 --> 00:26:15.075
I'm testing it out,
and it feels very good.

302
00:26:15.158 --> 00:26:16.076
Hmm.

303
00:26:16.159 --> 00:26:18.287
I'm never going to find something
for my da...

304
00:26:20.914 --> 00:26:24.877
Mother's Day, Mother's Day…
Everywhere I go, that's all I hear.

305
00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:29.965
I think if I hear "Mother's Day"
one more time, I'll... I'll scream.

306
00:26:30.048 --> 00:26:32.301
We got my mom an ice cream cake
for Mother's Day.

307
00:26:32.384 --> 00:26:36.471
I was going to get her a vanilla cake
or a chocolate cake for Mother's Day.

308
00:26:37.639 --> 00:26:39.766
But Sally suggested strawberry.

309
00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:42.686
And that seemed like the perfect flavor
for Mother's Day.

310
00:26:42.769 --> 00:26:47.107
Mother's Day. Mother's Day.
Mother's Day. Mother's Day.

311
00:26:50.319 --> 00:26:53.113
Whoa!

312
00:27:05.959 --> 00:27:08.504
It's ruined! Look what you did!

313
00:27:09.296 --> 00:27:12.883
S-Sorry, Lucille.

314
00:27:12.966 --> 00:27:16.178
Chuck. It's just...

315
00:27:16.678 --> 00:27:18.430
Uh, no time to explain.

316
00:27:19.598 --> 00:27:21.016
Sir, come back.

317
00:27:21.517 --> 00:27:24.728
Apparently Mother's Day
is not her favorite holiday.

318
00:27:30.234 --> 00:27:32.861
- Sir? Where are you going?
- Home.

319
00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:40.702
All I wanted to do was get my dad
a Mother's Day gift. I couldn't do that.

320
00:27:40.786 --> 00:27:42.412
- Maybe we can...
- No, Marcie.

321
00:27:42.496 --> 00:27:44.915
Whatever you're going to say,
I don't want to hear it.

322
00:27:44.998 --> 00:27:47.960
Every time you try to help,
I end up feeling worse.

323
00:27:48.043 --> 00:27:51.547
I... I'm sorry, sir.
That was never my intention.

324
00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:55.592
Mother's Day has always been bad for me,
and that's never going to change.

325
00:27:55.676 --> 00:27:58.136
So please, leave me alone.

326
00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:23.078
Ooh.

327
00:28:42.097 --> 00:28:43.432
Hmm.

328
00:29:32.105 --> 00:29:34.733
Aw.

329
00:30:15.899 --> 00:30:18.735
I bet ants don't have to
celebrate Mother's Day.

330
00:30:20.988 --> 00:30:22.823
Lucky ants.

331
00:30:23.365 --> 00:30:25.284
Ants are lucky, I suppose.

332
00:30:25.784 --> 00:30:28.287
They always seem to know
where they fit in.

333
00:30:30.122 --> 00:30:33.417
Every now and then, my dad says to me,

334
00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:36.336
"Peppermint Patty,
do you know what you are?"

335
00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:38.088
And I always say no.

336
00:30:38.172 --> 00:30:44.428
Then he says to me, "You are a rare gem."
And then we laugh about it.

337
00:30:44.511 --> 00:30:47.931
But sometimes I wish I wasn't so rare.

338
00:30:48.432 --> 00:30:49.933
I think I understand.

339
00:30:50.475 --> 00:30:54.605
Today everyone was so excited.
More than excited.

340
00:30:54.688 --> 00:30:58.025
They were happy
about celebrating their moms.

341
00:30:58.108 --> 00:31:03.488
And I knew, no matter what I do,
I'll never know how that feels.

342
00:31:03.572 --> 00:31:05.073
And I was angry.

343
00:31:05.657 --> 00:31:09.661
Have you ever thought
maybe your anger is really sadness?

344
00:31:21.006 --> 00:31:22.633
It's okay to cry, sir.

345
00:31:24.635 --> 00:31:27.763
One tear isn't crying.

346
00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:36.480
Maybe you could get your dad
something else.

347
00:31:37.064 --> 00:31:38.607
Don't start that again.

348
00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:41.777
I was thinking, sir,
we tried the usual things.

349
00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:42.861
But you are rare.

350
00:31:42.945 --> 00:31:46.657
Is there something you could give him
that could only come from you?

351
00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:48.325
I don't know.

352
00:31:48.408 --> 00:31:52.120
Well, what are your favorite things
to do together?

353
00:31:53.705 --> 00:31:54.957
Everything.

354
00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:59.211
We play baseball.
He taught me all I know about football.

355
00:31:59.294 --> 00:32:04.466
We like to tell each other dumb jokes.
The dumber they are, the more we laugh.

356
00:32:04.967 --> 00:32:08.720
He loves to hear me laugh.
He says it reminds him of my mom.

357
00:32:11.139 --> 00:32:13.851
- Huh?
- I know how to celebrate Mother's Day.

358
00:32:13.934 --> 00:32:16.603
Tomorrow I'll spend the whole day
with my dad.

359
00:32:16.687 --> 00:32:20.649
We'll play and talk to each other,
and I'm gonna make him laugh.

360
00:32:20.732 --> 00:32:22.192
And he'll make me laugh.

361
00:32:22.276 --> 00:32:25.404
And together
we'll share the biggest laugh ever.

362
00:32:25.487 --> 00:32:29.408
That sounds like the best
Mother's Day gift a father has ever had.

363
00:32:29.491 --> 00:32:32.286
Yeah! Yeah! It does! I gotta go!

364
00:32:33.954 --> 00:32:39.251
Marcie, if I said anything before
to hurt your feelings, I'm sorry.

365
00:32:39.334 --> 00:32:42.004
- You're a true friend. Mmm.
- You are too, sir.

366
00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:48.385
And wish your mom
a happy Mother's Day for me!

367
00:32:49.178 --> 00:32:50.387
Will do, sir.

368
00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:01.732
This is good.
But is it top-of-the-fridge good?

369
00:33:02.399 --> 00:33:03.442
Ahem.

370
00:33:11.241 --> 00:33:13.744
It's definitely top-of-the-fridge quality.

371
00:33:13.827 --> 00:33:15.871
Oh, thank goodness.

372
00:33:15.954 --> 00:33:18.624
I was starting to think
I had a self-doubt.

373
00:33:18.707 --> 00:33:22.252
- But it's still missing something.
- What? But you just said...

374
00:33:22.336 --> 00:33:25.047
All cards need a message inside.
It's a rule.

375
00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:29.551
Okay, wise guy. What does your letter say?

376
00:33:30.344 --> 00:33:31.345
Here.

377
00:33:32.679 --> 00:33:37.226
Hmm. Aw. Mmm.

378
00:33:37.309 --> 00:33:42.940
Linus. It's...
It's everything I wish I could say.

379
00:33:43.774 --> 00:33:47.611
Well, you know,
my letter needs something to go in.

380
00:33:47.694 --> 00:33:50.197
If you want,
we can put it inside your card

381
00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:52.282
and give them both to Mom together.

382
00:33:52.366 --> 00:33:53.867
You'd do that?

383
00:33:55.369 --> 00:33:58.288
It just needs one little change here.

384
00:34:03.335 --> 00:34:07.214
"Dear Mom,
I'm writing you this letter to thank you

385
00:34:07.297 --> 00:34:09.675
for the notes you put
in my school lunches.

386
00:34:09.757 --> 00:34:14.721
Also, to thank you for my school lunches,
especially the bologna sandwiches,

387
00:34:14.804 --> 00:34:17.516
not so much the tuna fish."

388
00:34:17.599 --> 00:34:21.436
"This is my way of thanking you
for all the things you do for me.

389
00:34:22.062 --> 00:34:25.482
<i>When I'm scared,
you give me cuddles and act so sweet.</i>

390
00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:30.654
<i>When I'm lonely,
you call me your 'forever best friend.'</i>

391
00:34:30.737 --> 00:34:31.947
<i>I like that.</i>

392
00:34:34.408 --> 00:34:37.494
<i>You always find the time
to listen to my new ideas."</i>

393
00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:45.168
<i>"You give me lots hugs and kisses,
even in front of my friends,</i>

394
00:34:45.252 --> 00:34:48.505
<i>which is sometimes embarrassing,
but I still like them.</i>

395
00:34:49.547 --> 00:34:53.969
<i>When I make mistakes,
you encourage me to try again and again.</i>

396
00:35:00.434 --> 00:35:02.561
<i>You make sure I'm safe every night.</i>

397
00:35:03.645 --> 00:35:06.648
<i>You give me your best
in your own special way."</i>

398
00:35:12.029 --> 00:35:13.864
Go long, Dad.

399
00:35:13.947 --> 00:35:15.908
Oh, nice catch.

400
00:35:15.991 --> 00:35:18.452
Say goodbye to that one, Dad.

401
00:35:18.535 --> 00:35:21.747
Here's another one.
What did the egg say to the chef?

402
00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:24.374
"You crack me up."

403
00:35:24.458 --> 00:35:26.376
<i>"When I'm sad, you make me laugh.</i>

404
00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:29.796
<i>And then you laugh too,
which makes me laugh even more."</i>

405
00:35:31.924 --> 00:35:36.595
"Mostly I know you're someone who loves me
and will always be there for me.

406
00:35:36.678 --> 00:35:40.516
I guess that's what moms do.
But you do it the best. That's why"...

407
00:35:40.599 --> 00:35:42.809
This is where you come in.

408
00:35:42.893 --> 00:35:48.524
We really, really, really love you back.
Happy Mother's Day.

409
00:36:00.827 --> 00:36:01.870
Ooh?

410
00:36:01.954 --> 00:36:03.789
Aw.

411
00:36:32.717 --> 00:36:34.717
