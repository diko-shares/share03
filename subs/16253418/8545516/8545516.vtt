I think I need
more than a Band-Aid.

I'm going to need
something sturdy.

707
00:42:28.994 --> 00:42:30.686
It's much steeper than before.

708
00:42:30.789 --> 00:42:32.688
Yeah, and a fuck of a lot deeper.

709
00:42:32.791 --> 00:42:36.036
So, you think we should
still wait it out?

710
00:42:36.139 --> 00:42:37.934
Uh, I don't know.

711
00:42:38.038 --> 00:42:40.523
The seabed's not as solid
as Brandon thought.

712
00:42:40.627 --> 00:42:43.388
Should we try to swim out the hole?

713
00:42:43.491 --> 00:42:45.010
I don't think we have a choice.

714
00:42:45.114 --> 00:42:48.496
- Well, what about the sharks?

Sharks don't like bubbles.

00:43:06.894 --> 00:43:09.138
We're gonna take advice
from an 8-year-old?

- I'm 10.
- I don't care.

723
00:43:10.518 --> 00:43:13.418
Hey, we're just trying to
figure out how to get out.

724
00:43:13.521 --> 00:43:15.247
- That's all.
- It's impossible.

725
00:43:15.351 --> 00:43:18.561
We'll never get to the surface
without air.

726
00:43:18.665 --> 00:43:21.944
I can hold my breath for a long time.

727
00:43:22.047 --> 00:43:24.118

and-- and some other shit?

732
00:43:36.924 --> 00:43:38.477

checked in

00:43:38.581 --> 00:43:41.308
- this, like, puke-green bag.
- Yeah, somewhere in the hold

734
00:43:41.411 --> 00:43:43.759
- with all the other cases.
- Okay, I'm just trying

735

to suggest something positive here.

736
00:43:45.588 --> 00:43:47.555
We can access the hold
through here.

737
00:43:47.659 --> 00:43:49.937
- There's a hatch.
- Great.

738
00:43:50.041 --> 00:43:51.525
Uh, so we have a good chance
of finding it, then.

739
00:43:51.629 --> 00:43:55.149
But the scuba tanks are empty.
They-- They have to be.

740
00:43:55.253 --> 00:43:57.393
Otherwise, they wouldn't have
been allowed on the aircraft.

741
00:43:57.496 --> 00:44:01.190
- Okay, but we can fill them.
- I don't think so, Kyle.

742

No. Come on. Um...

743
00:44:03.744 --> 00:44:06.402
What about these little dudes, huh?

744
00:44:06.505 --> 00:44:07.817
They're... they're buzzing out air

pull on this string.

746
00:44:10.164 --> 00:44:13.098
Okay, so the tanks
are useless to us,

747
00:44:13.202 --> 00:44:15.549
but they'll have other gear, right?

748
00:44:15.653 --> 00:44:17.344
If we're gonna get to the surface,

749
00:44:17.447 --> 00:44:19.139
we'll need masks and wet suits,

750
00:44:19.242 --> 00:44:21.382
and we could look
in the overhead lockers, too.

751

- You think we can, Ava?

I mean, swim to the surface?

753
00:44:26.422 --> 00:44:28.838
Even if we make it to the hole,

754
00:44:28.942 --> 00:44:31.530
that's a long way up without air.

When I was a kid,

my dad used to take me swimming.

I dive right to the bottom

1070

it was too far
to get back to the top.
