1
00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:51.300
l come from a land
From a faraway place

2
00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:54.636
Where the caravan camels roam

3
00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:58.557
Where it's flat and immense
And the heat is intense

4
00:00:58.641 --> 00:01:02.144
It's barbaric, but hey, it's home

5
00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:05.731
When the wind's from the east
And the sun's from the west

6
00:01:05.815 --> 00:01:08.942
And the sand in the glass is right

7
00:01:09.027 --> 00:01:13.489
Come on down, stop on by
Hop a carpet and fly

8
00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:17.743
To another Arabian night

9
00:01:17.827 --> 00:01:21.580
Arabian nights

10
00:01:21.664 --> 00:01:25.292
Like Arabian days

11
00:01:25.376 --> 00:01:29.171
More often than not
Are hotter than hot

12
00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:32.883
In a lot of good ways

13
00:01:32.967 --> 00:01:36.386
Arabian nights

14
00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:40.224
'Neath Arabian moons

15
00:01:40.308 --> 00:01:44.353
A fool off his guard
Could fall and fall hard

16
00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:48.941
Out there on the dunes

17
00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:56.448
SaIaam and good evening
to you, worthy friend.

18
00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:58.408
Please, please, come closer.

19
00:01:59.577 --> 00:02:01.328
Too close. A little too close.

20
00:02:01.412 --> 00:02:03.038
There.

21
00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:05.457
Welcome to Agrabah,

22
00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:09.753
city of mystery, of enchantment,

23
00:02:09.838 --> 00:02:11.880
and the finest merchandise
this side of the River Jordan,

24
00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:14.007
on sale today. Come on down.

25
00:02:14.092 --> 00:02:15.676
Look at this. Yes.

26
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.221
Combination hookah and coffeemaker.
Also makes julienne fries.

27
00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:22.015
Will not break. Will not. . .

28
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.600
It broke.

29
00:02:25.228 --> 00:02:26.353
Look at this.

30
00:02:26.437 --> 00:02:29.314
I have never seen
one of these intact before.

31
00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:31.316
This is the famous
Dead Sea Tupperware.

32
00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:34.653
Listen. Still good.

33
00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:36.572
Wait. Don't go.

34
00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:40.576
I can see that you're only interested
in the exceptionally rare.

35
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.746
I think, then, you would be
most rewarded to consider this.

36
00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:48.750
Do not be fooled
by its commonplace appearance.

37
00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:51.503
Like so many things,
it is not what is outside,

38
00:02:51.588 --> 00:02:54.339
but what is inside that counts.

39
00:02:54.424 --> 00:02:56.216
This is no ordinary lamp.

40
00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:59.136
It once changed the course
of a young man's life.

41
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.432
A young man who, like this lamp,
was more than what he seemed.

42
00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:05.767
A diamond in the rough.

43
00:03:06.227 --> 00:03:08.395
Perhaps you would like to hear the tale?

44
00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:11.982
It begins on a dark night,

45
00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:16.653
where a dark man waits

46
00:03:16.738 --> 00:03:19.948
with a dark purpose.

47
00:03:24.954 --> 00:03:27.080
You are late.

48
00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.083
A thousand apologies, O patient one.

49
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.376
You have it, then?

50
00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:34.796
I had to slit a few throats, but I got it.

51
00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:38.800
The treasure.

52
00:03:41.638 --> 00:03:45.557
Trust me, my pungent friend.

53
00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:49.186
-You'll get what's coming to you.
-What's coming to you.

54
00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.655
Quickly! Follow the trail.

55
00:04:03.952 --> 00:04:05.494
Faster.

56
00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.934
At last, after all my years of searching,

57
00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:31.853
the Cave of Wonders.

58
00:04:32.563 --> 00:04:33.939
Cave of Wonders.

59
00:04:34.023 --> 00:04:36.692
By Allah.

60
00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:40.946
Now, remember. Bring me the lamp.

61
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.075
The rest of the treasure is yours,
but the lamp is mine.

62
00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:51.498
The lamp. The lamp.

63
00:04:51.582 --> 00:04:54.710
Jeez, where'd you dig this bozo up?

64
00:05:08.725 --> 00:05:13.270
Who disturbs my slumber?

65
00:05:14.397 --> 00:05:18.942
It is I, Gazeem, a humble thief.

66
00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:20.819
Know this.

67
00:05:20.903 --> 00:05:23.905
Only one may enter here,

68
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.242
one whose worth lies far within.

69
00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.412
A diamond in the rough.

70
00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:33.582
What are you waiting for? Go on.

71
00:05:52.143 --> 00:05:53.685
No!

72
00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:59.900
Seek thee out the diamond in the rough.

73
00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:07.866
I can't believe it. I just don't believe it.

74
00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:12.245
We're never gonna get
a hold of that stupid lamp.

75
00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.833
Just forget it. Look at this.
I'm so ticked off that I'm moulting.

76
00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:21.254
Patience, Iago. Patience.

77
00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:24.633
Gazeem was obviously
less than worthy.

78
00:06:25.635 --> 00:06:27.260
There's a big surprise.

79
00:06:27.345 --> 00:06:32.015
I think I'm gonna have a heart attack
and die from that surprise.

80
00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:36.561
What are we gonna do?
We got a big problem here, a big. . .

81
00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:38.897
Yes.

82
00:06:38.981 --> 00:06:42.067
Only one may enter.

83
00:06:42.151 --> 00:06:44.444
I must find this one, this. . .

84
00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:47.155
Diamond in the rough.

85
00:06:48.157 --> 00:06:50.325
Stop! Thief!

86
00:06:50.576 --> 00:06:53.745
I'll have your hands for a trophy,
street rat.

87
00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.498
All this for a loaf of bread?

88
00:07:08.344 --> 00:07:11.763
-There he is!
-You won't get away so easy!

89
00:07:11.848 --> 00:07:13.849
You think that was easy?

90
00:07:15.476 --> 00:07:18.061
You two, over that way,
and you, follow me.

91
00:07:18.187 --> 00:07:20.439
-We'll find him.
-Morning, ladies.

92
00:07:20.523 --> 00:07:24.401
Getting into trouble a little early
today, aren't we, Aladdin?

93
00:07:24.485 --> 00:07:27.779
Trouble? No way.
You're only in trouble if you get caught.

94
00:07:27.864 --> 00:07:29.406
-Gotcha.
-I'm in trouble.

95
00:07:29.615 --> 00:07:30.866
And this time. . .

96
00:07:32.952 --> 00:07:34.786
Perfect timing, Abu, as usual.

97
00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:37.622
-Abu.
-Come on. Let's get outta here.

98
00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:40.417
Gotta keep one jump
Ahead of the bread line

99
00:07:40.501 --> 00:07:42.335
One swing ahead of the sword

100
00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.880
I steal only what I can't afford

101
00:07:44.964 --> 00:07:46.298
That's everything

102
00:07:46.382 --> 00:07:48.300
One jump ahead of the lawmen

103
00:07:48.384 --> 00:07:50.260
That's all, and that's no joke

104
00:07:50.344 --> 00:07:53.221
These guys don't appreciate I'm broke

105
00:07:53.806 --> 00:07:55.807
-Riffraff
-Street rat

106
00:07:55.892 --> 00:07:57.767
-Scoundrel
-Take that

107
00:07:57.852 --> 00:08:01.813
Just a little snack, guys

108
00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:05.817
Rip him open
Take it back, guys

109
00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:07.652
l can take a hint
Gotta face the facts

110
00:08:07.737 --> 00:08:09.821
-You're my only friend, Abu
-Who?

111
00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:13.658
lt's sad Aladdin's hit the bottom

112
00:08:13.743 --> 00:08:17.412
He's become a one-man rise in crime

113
00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:21.374
I'd blame parents
Except he hasn't got 'em

114
00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:23.168
Gotta eat to live
Gotta steal to eat

115
00:08:23.252 --> 00:08:25.504
Tell you all about it
When I got the time

116
00:08:25.588 --> 00:08:29.341
One jump ahead of the slowpokes
One skip ahead of my doom

117
00:08:29.425 --> 00:08:31.718
Next time gonna use a nom de plume

118
00:08:31.802 --> 00:08:33.094
There he is

119
00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:37.307
One jump ahead of the hit men
One hit ahead of the flock

120
00:08:37.391 --> 00:08:40.268
l think l'll take a stroll
Around the block

121
00:08:40.937 --> 00:08:42.938
-Stop, thief
-Vandal

122
00:08:43.022 --> 00:08:44.773
-Abu
-Scandal

123
00:08:44.857 --> 00:08:49.069
Let's not be too hasty

124
00:08:49.153 --> 00:08:52.948
Still l think he's rather tasty

125
00:08:53.115 --> 00:08:54.991
Gotta eat to live
Gotta steal to eat

126
00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:56.493
Otherwise we'd get along

127
00:08:56.577 --> 00:08:58.119
Wrong

128
00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:00.455
Get him !

129
00:09:07.171 --> 00:09:08.964
He's got a sword !

130
00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:12.884
You idiots. We've all got swords.

131
00:09:20.059 --> 00:09:21.935
-One jump ahead of the hoof beats
-Vandal!

132
00:09:22.019 --> 00:09:23.770
-One hop ahead of the hump
-Street rat!

133
00:09:23.854 --> 00:09:25.730
-One trick ahead of disaster
-Scoundrel!

134
00:09:25.815 --> 00:09:27.649
They're quick, but I'm much faster

135
00:09:27.733 --> 00:09:29.276
Here goes, better throw my hand in

136
00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.821
Wish me happy landin'
All I gotta do is jump

137
00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:50.088
And now, esteemed effendi, we feast.
All right.

138
00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:18.158
Here. Go on. Take it.

139
00:10:33.758 --> 00:10:35.175
Don't.

140
00:10:42.558 --> 00:10:45.018
On his way to the palace, I suppose.

141
00:10:45.102 --> 00:10:48.146
Another suitor for the princess.

142
00:10:51.108 --> 00:10:53.985
Out of my way, you filthy brats.

143
00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:55.153
Hey!

144
00:10:55.237 --> 00:10:58.073
If I were as rich as you,
I could afford some manners.

145
00:10:59.158 --> 00:11:02.035
I'll teach you some manners.

146
00:11:06.207 --> 00:11:07.707
Look at that, Abu.

147
00:11:07.792 --> 00:11:10.919
It's not every day you see
a horse with two rear ends.

148
00:11:12.588 --> 00:11:15.131
You are a worthless street rat.

149
00:11:15.216 --> 00:11:18.760
You were born a street rat,
you'll die a street rat,

150
00:11:18.844 --> 00:11:21.888
and only your fleas will mourn you.

151
00:11:25.393 --> 00:11:26.976
I'm not worthless.

152
00:11:27.061 --> 00:11:29.187
And I don't have fleas.

153
00:11:32.566 --> 00:11:35.151
Come on, Abu. Let's go home.

154
00:11:42.284 --> 00:11:45.203
Riffraff, street rat

155
00:11:45.287 --> 00:11:47.914
I don't buy that

156
00:11:47.998 --> 00:11:52.460
If only they'd look closer

157
00:11:52.545 --> 00:11:55.672
Would they see a poor boy?

158
00:11:55.756 --> 00:11:57.340
No, siree

159
00:11:59.885 --> 00:12:03.054
They'd find out

160
00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:07.058
There's so much more

161
00:12:07.143 --> 00:12:12.856
To me

162
00:12:15.818 --> 00:12:19.195
Someday, Abu,
things are gonna change.

163
00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:22.157
We'll be rich, live in a palace,

164
00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:24.409
and never have any problems at all.

165
00:12:29.248 --> 00:12:30.999
I've never been so insulted.

166
00:12:31.083 --> 00:12:35.128
Prince Achmed.
You're not leaving so soon, are you?

167
00:12:35.212 --> 00:12:37.172
Good luck marrying her off.

168
00:12:38.632 --> 00:12:40.008
Jasmine.

169
00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:47.474
Jasmine!

170
00:12:47.892 --> 00:12:49.893
Confound it, Rajah.

171
00:12:52.897 --> 00:12:56.107
So, this is why
Prince Achmed stormed out.

172
00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:57.776
Oh, Father.

173
00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:00.612
Rajah was just playing with him.
Weren't you, Rajah?

174
00:13:00.696 --> 00:13:02.864
You were just playing
with that overdressed,

175
00:13:02.948 --> 00:13:05.784
self-absorbed Prince Achmed,
weren't you?

176
00:13:09.872 --> 00:13:14.292
Dearest, you've got to stop rejecting
every suitor who comes to call.

177
00:13:14.376 --> 00:13:17.962
The law says
you must be married to a prince

178
00:13:18.047 --> 00:13:20.131
by your next birthday.

179
00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:21.674
The law is wrong.

180
00:13:21.759 --> 00:13:24.135
You've only got three more days.

181
00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:27.722
Father, I hate being forced into this.

182
00:13:27.848 --> 00:13:31.309
If I do marry, I want it to be for love.

183
00:13:31.393 --> 00:13:32.602
Jasmine,

184
00:13:33.354 --> 00:13:36.397
it's not only this law.

185
00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:42.237
I'm not going to be around forever,
and, well, I. . .

186
00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:47.242
I just want to make sure
you're taken care of.

187
00:13:47.326 --> 00:13:48.743
Provided for.

188
00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:50.995
Please try to understand.

189
00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:55.625
I've never done a thing on my own.
I've never had any real friends.

190
00:13:56.919 --> 00:13:58.461
Except you, Rajah.

191
00:13:59.755 --> 00:14:02.882
I've never even been outside
the palace walls.

192
00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:05.635
But, Jasmine, you're a princess.

193
00:14:05.719 --> 00:14:08.346
Then maybe I don't want
to be a princess any more.

194
00:14:11.559 --> 00:14:14.394
Allah forbid you should
have any daughters.

195
00:14:27.825 --> 00:14:30.869
I don't know where she gets it from.

196
00:14:30.953 --> 00:14:34.289
Her mother wasn't nearly so picky.

197
00:14:36.417 --> 00:14:37.792
Jafar.

198
00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:40.461
My most trusted advisor.

199
00:14:40.546 --> 00:14:43.339
I am in desperate need of your wisdom.

200
00:14:43.424 --> 00:14:46.342
My life is but to serve you, my lord.

201
00:14:46.468 --> 00:14:50.722
It's this suitor business.
Jasmine refuses to choose a husband.

202
00:14:50.806 --> 00:14:53.975
-I'm at my wit's end.
-Wit's end !

203
00:14:56.478 --> 00:14:59.439
Have a cracker, pretty Polly.

204
00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:04.319
Your Majesty certainly
has a way with dumb animals.

205
00:15:05.529 --> 00:15:09.616
Now, then,
perhaps I can divine a solution

206
00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:11.659
to this thorny problem.

207
00:15:11.744 --> 00:15:13.494
If anyone can help, it's you.

208
00:15:13.579 --> 00:15:18.416
But it would require the use
of the mystic blue diamond.

209
00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:21.628
My ring?

210
00:15:21.712 --> 00:15:24.005
But it's been in the family for years.

211
00:15:24.089 --> 00:15:27.050
It is necessary to find
the princess a suitor.

212
00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:29.093
Don't worry.

213
00:15:29.678 --> 00:15:35.642
Everything will be fine.

214
00:15:35.726 --> 00:15:37.852
The diamond.

215
00:15:37.937 --> 00:15:40.271
Here, Jafar.

216
00:15:40.356 --> 00:15:43.942
Whatever you need will be fine.

217
00:15:44.026 --> 00:15:46.152
You are most gracious, my liege.

218
00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:50.448
Now, run along and play
with your little toys.

219
00:15:50.532 --> 00:15:54.369
Yes. That will be pretty good.

220
00:15:57.081 --> 00:15:59.332
I can't take it any more!

221
00:15:59.416 --> 00:16:05.046
If I gotta choke down on one more
of those mouldy, disgusting crackers. . .

222
00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.467
Calm yourself, Iago.

223
00:16:09.551 --> 00:16:10.969
Then I'd grab him around the head.

224
00:16:11.053 --> 00:16:15.348
Soon I will be sultan,
not that addlepated twit.

225
00:16:15.432 --> 00:16:19.560
And then I stuff the crackers
down his throat.

226
00:16:39.123 --> 00:16:41.499
I'm sorry, Rajah.

227
00:16:41.583 --> 00:16:45.378
But I can't stay here
and have my life lived for me.

228
00:16:46.755 --> 00:16:48.256
I'll miss you.

229
00:16:57.641 --> 00:16:59.559
Goodbye.

230
00:17:09.945 --> 00:17:11.696
Okay, Abu. Go.

231
00:17:13.949 --> 00:17:17.952
Try this. Your taste buds
will dance and sing.

232
00:17:19.455 --> 00:17:21.998
Get your paws off that.

233
00:17:22.082 --> 00:17:23.124
Why, you. . .

234
00:17:23.459 --> 00:17:27.086
Get away from here,
you cursed, filthy ape!

235
00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:30.131
Goodbye.

236
00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:32.300
Nice going, Abu.

237
00:17:33.677 --> 00:17:35.136
Breakfast is served.

238
00:17:39.975 --> 00:17:43.978
Pretty lady, buy a pot.
No finer pot in brass or silver.

239
00:17:44.063 --> 00:17:46.522
Sugar dates. Sugar dates and figs.

240
00:17:46.607 --> 00:17:48.900
Sugar dates and pistachios.

241
00:17:48.984 --> 00:17:50.735
Would the lady like a necklace?

242
00:17:50.819 --> 00:17:53.071
A pretty necklace for a pretty lady.

243
00:17:53.155 --> 00:17:54.655
Fresh fish !

244
00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.074
We catch 'em, you buy 'em !

245
00:17:56.158 --> 00:17:57.825
Oh, no. I don't think so.

246
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.579
Excuse me.

247
00:18:05.834 --> 00:18:08.669
I'm really very sorry.

248
00:18:19.014 --> 00:18:21.015
Hello? Hello?

249
00:18:24.853 --> 00:18:26.521
You must be hungry.

250
00:18:26.855 --> 00:18:28.022
Here you go.

251
00:18:28.107 --> 00:18:31.109
You'd better be able to pay for that.

252
00:18:31.735 --> 00:18:34.737
-Pay?
-No one steals from my cart.

253
00:18:34.822 --> 00:18:37.698
I'm sorry, sir. I don't have any money.

254
00:18:37.783 --> 00:18:39.450
-Thief!
-Please. . .

255
00:18:39.535 --> 00:18:42.286
If you let me go to the palace,
I can get some from the sultan.

256
00:18:42.371 --> 00:18:45.414
Do you know
what the penalty is for stealing?

257
00:18:45.499 --> 00:18:46.999
No! No, please!

258
00:18:47.501 --> 00:18:51.129
Thank you, kind sir.
I'm so glad you found her.

259
00:18:51.213 --> 00:18:52.630
I've been looking all over for you.

260
00:18:52.714 --> 00:18:54.215
-What are you doing?
-Just play along.

261
00:18:54.299 --> 00:18:56.843
You know this girl?

262
00:18:56.927 --> 00:18:59.887
Sadly, yes. She is my sister.

263
00:18:59.972 --> 00:19:01.430
She's a little crazy.

264
00:19:01.515 --> 00:19:04.267
She said she knew the sultan.

265
00:19:04.351 --> 00:19:06.561
She thinks the monkey is the sultan.

266
00:19:09.064 --> 00:19:12.608
O wise Sultan, how may I serve you?

267
00:19:16.405 --> 00:19:18.281
Tragic, isn't it?

268
00:19:18.365 --> 00:19:20.575
But no harm done.

269
00:19:20.659 --> 00:19:23.286
Now, come along, sis.
Time to go see the doctor.

270
00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:25.663
Hello, Doctor. How are you?

271
00:19:25.747 --> 00:19:29.292
No, no, no. Not that one.
Come on, Sultan.

272
00:19:33.589 --> 00:19:34.714
What?

273
00:19:34.798 --> 00:19:37.091
Come back here, you little thieves!

274
00:19:41.597 --> 00:19:44.515
With all due respect, Your Rottenness,

275
00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.727
couldn't we just wait for a real storm?

276
00:19:47.936 --> 00:19:50.229
Save your breath, Iago. Faster.

277
00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:53.774
Yes, O mighty evil one.

278
00:19:57.154 --> 00:19:59.572
Part, sands of time.

279
00:19:59.656 --> 00:20:03.576
Reveal to me the one
who can enter the cave.

280
00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:06.787
Yes! Yes!

281
00:20:07.331 --> 00:20:09.707
There he is.

282
00:20:09.791 --> 00:20:12.084
My diamond in the rough.

283
00:20:12.169 --> 00:20:15.588
That's him? That's the clown
we've been waitin' for?

284
00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:22.136
Let's have the guards extend him
an invitation to the palace, shall we?

285
00:20:22.804 --> 00:20:24.430
Swell.

286
00:20:28.644 --> 00:20:30.603
Almost there.

287
00:20:38.195 --> 00:20:40.988
I want to thank you
for stopping that man.

288
00:20:42.074 --> 00:20:43.324
Forget it.

289
00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:47.620
So, this is your first time
in the marketplace?

290
00:20:50.374 --> 00:20:51.749
Is it that obvious?

291
00:20:52.459 --> 00:20:54.835
Well, you do kind of stand out.

292
00:20:56.672 --> 00:21:00.341
I mean, you don't seem to know
how dangerous Agrabah can be.

293
00:21:02.761 --> 00:21:04.512
I'm a fast learner.

294
00:21:06.265 --> 00:21:07.640
Hey.

295
00:21:09.768 --> 00:21:11.686
Come on. This way.

296
00:21:13.313 --> 00:21:14.981
Watch your head there.

297
00:21:15.065 --> 00:21:16.524
Be careful.

298
00:21:16.608 --> 00:21:18.234
Is this where you live?

299
00:21:18.694 --> 00:21:22.113
Yep. Just me and Abu.
Come and go as we please.

300
00:21:22.197 --> 00:21:23.948
That sounds fabulous.

301
00:21:24.032 --> 00:21:28.160
Well, it's not much,
but it's got a great view.

302
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:31.831
The palace looks pretty amazing, huh?

303
00:21:33.458 --> 00:21:35.126
It's wonderful.

304
00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:37.503
I wonder what it would
be like to live there,

305
00:21:37.587 --> 00:21:40.256
and have servants and valets.

306
00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:43.634
Sure. People who tell you
where to go and how to dress.

307
00:21:45.053 --> 00:21:46.345
It's better than here.

308
00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:48.973
You're always scraping for food
and ducking the guards.

309
00:21:49.057 --> 00:21:51.309
You're not free
to make your own choices.

310
00:21:51.393 --> 00:21:53.769
-Sometimes you feel so. . .
-You're just. . .

311
00:21:53.854 --> 00:21:55.479
-Trapped.
-Trapped.

312
00:22:00.902 --> 00:22:02.987
So, where are you from?

313
00:22:03.905 --> 00:22:05.281
What does it matter?

314
00:22:05.365 --> 00:22:07.908
I ran away and I am not going back.

315
00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:12.079
-Really? How come?
-Why, you. . .

316
00:22:13.915 --> 00:22:16.417
My father's forcing me to get married.

317
00:22:17.336 --> 00:22:19.754
That's awful.

318
00:22:20.797 --> 00:22:22.089
Abu !

319
00:22:24.343 --> 00:22:25.760
What?

320
00:22:26.636 --> 00:22:30.014
Abu says that's not fair.

321
00:22:30.098 --> 00:22:31.182
What?

322
00:22:31.266 --> 00:22:34.018
-Oh, did he?
-Yeah, of course.

323
00:22:34.102 --> 00:22:38.147
And does Abu
have anything else to say?

324
00:22:38.231 --> 00:22:41.359
Well, he wishes there was something
he could do to help.

325
00:22:41.443 --> 00:22:42.985
Oh, boy.

326
00:22:45.614 --> 00:22:48.449
Tell him that's very sweet.

327
00:22:50.952 --> 00:22:52.536
Here you are.

328
00:22:52.621 --> 00:22:54.789
-They're after me!
-They're after you?

329
00:22:54.873 --> 00:22:56.207
My father must have sent them. . .

330
00:22:56.291 --> 00:22:57.458
-Do you trust me?
-What?

331
00:22:57.542 --> 00:23:00.127
-Do you trust me?
-Yes. . .

332
00:23:00.212 --> 00:23:01.629
Then jump!

333
00:23:07.135 --> 00:23:11.514
We just keep running into each other,
don't we, street rat?

334
00:23:12.557 --> 00:23:14.850
Run ! Go! Get out of here!

335
00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:16.852
Get this thing off of me!

336
00:23:17.604 --> 00:23:20.731
-It's the dungeon for you, boy.
-Get off of me.

337
00:23:20.816 --> 00:23:21.899
Let him go.

338
00:23:21.983 --> 00:23:24.944
Looky here, men. A street mouse.

339
00:23:26.446 --> 00:23:30.282
Unhand him, by order of the princess.

340
00:23:31.827 --> 00:23:33.202
Princess Jasmine.

341
00:23:33.495 --> 00:23:35.121
-The princess?
-Princess?

342
00:23:35.205 --> 00:23:38.416
What are you doing outside the palace?
And with this street rat.

343
00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:42.545
That's not your concern.
Do as I command. Release him.

344
00:23:42.629 --> 00:23:46.382
I would, Princess,
except my orders come from Jafar.

345
00:23:46.466 --> 00:23:50.177
-You'll have to take it up with him.
-Believe me, I will.

346
00:23:56.852 --> 00:23:58.519
Jafar?

347
00:23:59.229 --> 00:24:00.396
Princess.

348
00:24:01.231 --> 00:24:02.898
Jafar, I'm stuck.

349
00:24:02.983 --> 00:24:05.192
How may I be of service to you?

350
00:24:05.277 --> 00:24:08.320
The guards just took a boy
from the market, on your orders.

351
00:24:09.197 --> 00:24:12.616
Your father has charged me
with keeping peace in Agrabah.

352
00:24:12.701 --> 00:24:15.536
-The boy was a criminal.
-What was his crime?

353
00:24:15.662 --> 00:24:16.912
I can't breathe, Jafar.

354
00:24:16.997 --> 00:24:20.583
Why, kidnapping the princess,
of course.

355
00:24:20.667 --> 00:24:22.918
If you could just. . . That hurt!

356
00:24:23.003 --> 00:24:25.588
He didn't kidnap me. I ran away.

357
00:24:25.672 --> 00:24:27.756
Oh, dear.

358
00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:32.678
How frightfully upsetting.
Had I but known. . .

359
00:24:33.472 --> 00:24:34.597
What do you mean?

360
00:24:34.681 --> 00:24:38.309
Sadly, the boy's sentence
has already been carried out.

361
00:24:38.393 --> 00:24:39.643
What sentence?

362
00:24:40.061 --> 00:24:41.604
Death.

363
00:24:41.688 --> 00:24:44.315
-By beheading.
-No.

364
00:24:47.277 --> 00:24:51.071
I am exceedingly sorry, Princess.

365
00:24:51.156 --> 00:24:52.907
How could you?

366
00:25:03.752 --> 00:25:05.419
So, how did it go?

367
00:25:05.504 --> 00:25:09.131
I think she took it rather well.

368
00:25:22.938 --> 00:25:25.231
It's all my fault, Rajah.

369
00:25:27.567 --> 00:25:30.611
I didn't even know his name.

370
00:25:49.464 --> 00:25:53.050
She was the princess. I can't believe it.

371
00:25:54.302 --> 00:25:56.387
I must have sounded so stupid to her.

372
00:25:57.806 --> 00:26:00.099
Aladdin ! Hello!

373
00:26:01.226 --> 00:26:02.977
Abu. Down here.

374
00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.398
Come on, help me out of these.

375
00:26:14.364 --> 00:26:17.866
Hey, she was in trouble.
She was worth it.

376
00:26:18.326 --> 00:26:19.702
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

377
00:26:19.786 --> 00:26:22.288
Don't worry, Abu.
I'll never see her again.

378
00:26:22.539 --> 00:26:25.165
I'm a street rat, remember?
And there's a law.

379
00:26:26.001 --> 00:26:27.668
She's gotta marry a prince.

380
00:26:28.628 --> 00:26:30.379
She deserves a prince.

381
00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:34.550
I'm a fool.

382
00:26:34.634 --> 00:26:38.178
You're only a fool if you give up, boy.

383
00:26:38.888 --> 00:26:40.306
Who are you?

384
00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:43.183
A lowly prisoner, like yourself.

385
00:26:43.268 --> 00:26:46.353
But together, perhaps we can be more.

386
00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:48.272
I'm listening.

387
00:26:48.356 --> 00:26:52.651
There is a cave, boy,
a Cave of Wonders,

388
00:26:52.736 --> 00:26:56.697
filled with treasures
beyond your wildest dreams.

389
00:26:58.366 --> 00:27:02.870
Treasure enough to impress
even your princess, I'd wager.

390
00:27:02.954 --> 00:27:05.623
Jafar, can you hurry up?
I'm dyin' in here.

391
00:27:05.707 --> 00:27:08.250
But the law says only a prince can. . .

392
00:27:08.335 --> 00:27:10.961
You've heard of the golden rule,
haven't you?

393
00:27:11.171 --> 00:27:13.756
Whoever has the gold makes the rules.

394
00:27:15.091 --> 00:27:18.135
Why would you share all of this
wonderful treasure with me?

395
00:27:18.219 --> 00:27:22.765
I need a young pair of legs
and a strong back to go in after it.

396
00:27:23.475 --> 00:27:24.808
One problem.

397
00:27:24.893 --> 00:27:27.061
It's out there. We're in here.

398
00:27:28.563 --> 00:27:32.191
Things aren't always what they seem.

399
00:27:33.068 --> 00:27:35.903
So, do we have a deal?

400
00:27:37.322 --> 00:27:39.156
I don't know.

401
00:27:50.752 --> 00:27:54.505
Who disturbs my slumber?

402
00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.051
It is I, Aladdin.

403
00:28:00.595 --> 00:28:03.097
Proceed.

404
00:28:03.223 --> 00:28:06.558
Touch nothing but the lamp.

405
00:28:07.185 --> 00:28:10.479
Remember, boy, first fetch me the lamp,

406
00:28:10.563 --> 00:28:14.441
and then you shall have your reward.

407
00:28:14.526 --> 00:28:16.276
Come on, Abu.

408
00:28:30.583 --> 00:28:32.376
Would you look at that!

409
00:28:35.839 --> 00:28:39.550
Just a handful of this stuff
would make me richer than the sultan.

410
00:28:40.635 --> 00:28:41.760
Abu !

411
00:28:43.388 --> 00:28:46.056
Don't touch anything.

412
00:28:46.141 --> 00:28:47.808
We gotta find that lamp.

413
00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:22.009
-Aladdin !
-Abu, will you knock it off?

414
00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:47.993
Abu, what are you, crazy?

415
00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:53.123
A magic carpet.

416
00:29:53.708 --> 00:29:56.960
Come on. Come on out.
We're not gonna hurt you.

417
00:30:06.554 --> 00:30:09.890
Hey, take it easy, Abu.
He's not gonna bite.

418
00:30:09.974 --> 00:30:11.058
Thanks.

419
00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:21.527
Wait a minute. Don't go.

420
00:30:21.611 --> 00:30:23.529
Maybe you can help us.

421
00:30:26.115 --> 00:30:27.533
Hey!

422
00:30:28.409 --> 00:30:30.244
You see, we're trying to find this lamp.

423
00:30:32.539 --> 00:30:35.415
I think he knows where it is.

424
00:30:50.974 --> 00:30:52.391
Wait here.

425
00:31:27.135 --> 00:31:28.719
This is it?

426
00:31:28.803 --> 00:31:31.305
This is what we came
all the way down here to. . .

427
00:31:31.931 --> 00:31:34.391
Abu ! No!

428
00:31:34.475 --> 00:31:36.685
Infidels!

429
00:31:37.562 --> 00:31:42.441
You have touched
the forbidden treasure!

430
00:31:43.985 --> 00:31:49.156
Now you will never again
see the light of day!

431
00:32:16.017 --> 00:32:18.936
Help! Help! Help!

432
00:32:20.855 --> 00:32:22.397
Gotcha!

433
00:32:26.027 --> 00:32:27.694
Carpet, let's move.

434
00:32:43.252 --> 00:32:44.795
Abu !

435
00:32:44.879 --> 00:32:47.214
Abu, this is no time to panic.

436
00:32:48.549 --> 00:32:49.633
Start panicking.

437
00:33:20.999 --> 00:33:23.083
-Help me out.
-Throw me the lamp.

438
00:33:23.167 --> 00:33:25.669
I can't hold on. Give me your hand.

439
00:33:25.753 --> 00:33:27.629
First give me the lamp.

440
00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:35.554
Yes!

441
00:33:35.638 --> 00:33:38.098
At last!

442
00:33:41.602 --> 00:33:42.686
What are you doing?

443
00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:45.355
Giving you your reward.

444
00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:49.443
Your eternal reward.

445
00:34:16.137 --> 00:34:17.888
It's mine.

446
00:34:17.972 --> 00:34:19.806
It's all mine.

447
00:34:20.516 --> 00:34:23.060
I. . . Where is it?

448
00:34:23.144 --> 00:34:24.436
No.

449
00:34:24.771 --> 00:34:27.272
No!

450
00:34:32.528 --> 00:34:33.653
Jasmine?

451
00:34:36.449 --> 00:34:37.824
Oh, dearest.

452
00:34:38.701 --> 00:34:40.160
What's wrong?

453
00:34:41.621 --> 00:34:44.206
Jafar has

454
00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:46.833
done something terrible.

455
00:34:46.918 --> 00:34:49.628
There, there, my dear.

456
00:34:49.712 --> 00:34:51.838
We'll set it right.

457
00:34:51.923 --> 00:34:54.549
Now, tell me everything.

458
00:34:59.097 --> 00:35:01.598
Aladdin. Wake up.

459
00:35:01.682 --> 00:35:02.974
Aladdin.

460
00:35:05.144 --> 00:35:06.353
My head.

461
00:35:09.524 --> 00:35:10.857
We're trapped.

462
00:35:10.942 --> 00:35:14.152
That two-faced son of a jackal !

463
00:35:15.404 --> 00:35:19.741
Whoever he was,
he's long gone with that lamp.

464
00:35:22.245 --> 00:35:24.579
Why, you hairy little thief.

465
00:35:25.373 --> 00:35:28.625
Looks like such a beat-up,
worthless piece of junk.

466
00:35:28.709 --> 00:35:31.086
Hey, I think there's
something written here,

467
00:35:31.170 --> 00:35:34.005
but it's hard to make out.

468
00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:55.902
1 0,000 years will give you
such a crick in the neck.

469
00:35:55.987 --> 00:35:57.404
Hang on a second.

470
00:36:00.241 --> 00:36:02.659
Does it feel good to be outta there.

471
00:36:02.743 --> 00:36:04.870
I'm telling you,
nice to be back, ladies and gentlemen.

472
00:36:04.954 --> 00:36:06.913
Hi. Where you from?
What's your name?

473
00:36:07.415 --> 00:36:08.540
Aladdin.

474
00:36:08.624 --> 00:36:11.626
Aladdin. Hello, Aladdin.
Nice to have you on the show.

475
00:36:11.711 --> 00:36:13.712
Can we call you Al?
Or maybe just Din?

476
00:36:13.796 --> 00:36:17.966
How about Laddie? Sounds like,
"Here, boy. C'mon, laddie."

477
00:36:18.926 --> 00:36:21.261
I must have hit my head
harder than I thought.

478
00:36:21.345 --> 00:36:24.181
Do you smoke? Mind if I do?

479
00:36:24.265 --> 00:36:26.892
Oh, sorry, Cheeta.
Hope I didn't singe the fur.

480
00:36:26.976 --> 00:36:29.561
Yo, Rugman. Haven't seen you
in a few millennia.

481
00:36:29.645 --> 00:36:33.190
Give me some tassel. Yeah. Yo, yo.

482
00:36:33.274 --> 00:36:37.027
Say, you're a lot smaller
than my last master.

483
00:36:37.111 --> 00:36:38.403
Either that or I'm gettin' bigger.

484
00:36:38.487 --> 00:36:40.614
Look at me from the side.
Do I look different to you?

485
00:36:40.698 --> 00:36:43.617
Wait a minute. I'm your master?

486
00:36:43.701 --> 00:36:46.786
That's right. He can be taught.
What would you wish of me?

487
00:36:46.871 --> 00:36:49.039
The ever impressive,

488
00:36:49.123 --> 00:36:52.334
the long contained,

489
00:36:52.418 --> 00:36:53.418
the often imitated,

490
00:36:53.502 --> 00:36:55.545
but never duplicated. . .

491
00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:57.714
Duplicated, duplicated. . .

492
00:36:57.798 --> 00:37:01.593
Genie of the Lamp!

493
00:37:01.677 --> 00:37:03.428
Right here direct from the lamp,

494
00:37:03.512 --> 00:37:06.097
right here
for your very much wish fulfilment.

495
00:37:06.182 --> 00:37:07.349
Thank you.

496
00:37:08.476 --> 00:37:10.769
-Wish fulfilment?
-Three wishes, to be exact.

497
00:37:10.853 --> 00:37:13.730
And ixnay on the wishing
for more wishes.

498
00:37:13.814 --> 00:37:15.857
That's it. Three.

499
00:37:16.567 --> 00:37:18.902
No substitutions, exchanges or refunds.

500
00:37:18.986 --> 00:37:20.195
Now I know I'm dreaming.

501
00:37:20.529 --> 00:37:24.157
Master, I don't think you quite realise
what you've got here.

502
00:37:24.242 --> 00:37:29.454
So why don't you just ruminate
whilst I illuminate the possibilities.

503
00:37:30.706 --> 00:37:33.416
Well, Ali Baba had them 40 thieves

504
00:37:33.501 --> 00:37:35.252
Scheherazade had a thousand tales

505
00:37:35.711 --> 00:37:38.088
But, master, you're in luck
'Cause up your sleeves

506
00:37:38.172 --> 00:37:40.423
You got a brand of magic never fails

507
00:37:40.508 --> 00:37:43.009
You got some power
In your corner now

508
00:37:43.094 --> 00:37:45.345
Some heavy ammunition in your camp

509
00:37:45.429 --> 00:37:47.847
You got some punch, pizzazz
Yahoo and how

510
00:37:47.932 --> 00:37:51.059
See, all you gotta do
Is rub that lamp and I'll say

511
00:37:51.143 --> 00:37:55.230
"Mr Aladdin, sir
What will your pleasure be?"

512
00:37:55.314 --> 00:37:57.691
Let me take your order
Jot it down

513
00:37:57.775 --> 00:37:59.693
You ain't never had a friend like me

514
00:38:00.987 --> 00:38:05.031
Life is your restaurant
And I'm your maitre d'

515
00:38:05.116 --> 00:38:07.492
Come on, whisper what it is you want

516
00:38:07.576 --> 00:38:09.619
You ain't never had a friend like me

517
00:38:09.704 --> 00:38:12.372
Yes, sir
We pride ourselves on service

518
00:38:12.456 --> 00:38:15.000
You're the boss, the king, the shah

519
00:38:15.084 --> 00:38:17.460
Say what you wish
It's yours, true dish

520
00:38:17.545 --> 00:38:20.588
How 'bout a little more baklava?

521
00:38:20.673 --> 00:38:24.926
Have some of column A
Try all of column B

522
00:38:25.011 --> 00:38:27.304
I'm in the mood to help you, dude

523
00:38:27.388 --> 00:38:29.723
You ain't never had a friend like me

524
00:38:31.392 --> 00:38:33.685
Oh, my

525
00:38:33.769 --> 00:38:36.104
No, no

526
00:38:36.188 --> 00:38:37.564
My, my

527
00:38:38.941 --> 00:38:41.359
Can your friends do this?

528
00:38:41.444 --> 00:38:43.820
Can your friends do that?

529
00:38:43.904 --> 00:38:46.281
Can your friends pull this

530
00:38:46.365 --> 00:38:48.825
Out their little hat?

531
00:38:48.909 --> 00:38:51.161
Can your friends go...

532
00:38:51.245 --> 00:38:53.121
Hey, looky here

533
00:38:53.789 --> 00:38:56.958
Can your friends go
"Abracadabra, let her rip"

534
00:38:57.043 --> 00:38:59.169
And then make the sucker disappear?

535
00:38:59.337 --> 00:39:01.838
So don't you sit there
Slack-jawed, buggy-eyed

536
00:39:01.922 --> 00:39:03.965
l'm here to answer
All your midnight prayers

537
00:39:04.050 --> 00:39:06.509
You got me bona fide certified

538
00:39:06.594 --> 00:39:08.845
You got a genie
For your charge d'affaires

539
00:39:08.929 --> 00:39:11.181
I got a powerful urge to help you out

540
00:39:11.265 --> 00:39:13.516
So what's your wish?
I really wanna know

541
00:39:13.601 --> 00:39:15.852
You got a list
That's three miles long, no doubt

542
00:39:15.936 --> 00:39:18.897
All you gotta do is rub like so

543
00:39:18.981 --> 00:39:23.109
Mr Aladdin, sir
Have a wish or two or three

544
00:39:23.194 --> 00:39:25.653
I'm on the job, you big nabob

545
00:39:25.738 --> 00:39:30.367
You ain't never had a friend
Never had a friend

546
00:39:30.451 --> 00:39:34.662
You ain't never had a friend

547
00:39:34.747 --> 00:39:37.957
Like me

548
00:39:42.797 --> 00:39:45.924
You ain't never had a friend like me

549
00:39:51.639 --> 00:39:52.931
So, what'll it be, master?

550
00:39:53.641 --> 00:39:57.268
You're gonna grant me
any three wishes I want, right?

551
00:39:57.353 --> 00:39:58.561
Almost.

552
00:39:58.646 --> 00:40:01.731
There are a few provisos,
a couple of quid pro quos.

553
00:40:01.816 --> 00:40:02.941
Like?

554
00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:06.194
Rule number one, I can't kill anybody.

555
00:40:06.278 --> 00:40:07.612
So don't ask.

556
00:40:07.696 --> 00:40:08.947
Rule number two.

557
00:40:09.031 --> 00:40:12.659
I can't make anybody
fall in love with anybody else.

558
00:40:13.244 --> 00:40:15.245
You little ponem there.

559
00:40:15.329 --> 00:40:19.916
Rule number three. I can't bring
people back from the dead.

560
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.836
It's not a pretty picture.
I don't like doing it.

561
00:40:23.462 --> 00:40:25.505
Other than that, you got it.

562
00:40:29.343 --> 00:40:32.429
Provisos? You mean limitations?

563
00:40:32.513 --> 00:40:35.598
On wishes? Some all-powerful genie.

564
00:40:36.183 --> 00:40:38.476
Can't even bring people
back from the dead.

565
00:40:38.561 --> 00:40:41.980
I don't know, Abu. He probably
can't even get us out of this cave.

566
00:40:42.064 --> 00:40:44.482
Looks like we're gonna have to
find a way out of here.

567
00:40:44.692 --> 00:40:46.484
Excuse me?

568
00:40:46.569 --> 00:40:49.362
Are you lookin' at me?
Did you rub my lamp?

569
00:40:49.447 --> 00:40:52.449
Did you wake me up?
Did you bring me here?

570
00:40:52.533 --> 00:40:54.534
And all of sudden
you're walking out on me?

571
00:40:54.618 --> 00:40:57.454
I don't think so, not right now.

572
00:40:57.538 --> 00:40:59.956
You're gettin' your wishes, so sit down !

573
00:41:01.208 --> 00:41:02.292
In case of emergency,

574
00:41:02.376 --> 00:41:04.878
the exits are here, here,
here, here, anywhere.

575
00:41:04.962 --> 00:41:07.297
Keep your hands and arms
inside the carpet.

576
00:41:07.381 --> 00:41:09.257
We're. . .

577
00:41:10.384 --> 00:41:12.802
Outta here!

578
00:41:14.305 --> 00:41:16.973
Jafar, this is an outrage.

579
00:41:17.057 --> 00:41:19.851
If it weren't for all your years
of loyal service. . .

580
00:41:19.935 --> 00:41:24.314
From now on, you are to discuss
sentencing of prisoners with me,

581
00:41:24.398 --> 00:41:26.900
before they are beheaded.

582
00:41:26.984 --> 00:41:29.903
I assure you, Your Highness,
it won't happen again.

583
00:41:30.029 --> 00:41:31.404
Jasmine. . .

584
00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:36.284
Jafar. Let's put this whole
messy business behind us.

585
00:41:36.368 --> 00:41:37.494
Please.

586
00:41:37.578 --> 00:41:42.123
My most abject and humblest apologies
to you as well, Princess.

587
00:41:42.208 --> 00:41:45.084
At least some good will come
of my being forced to marry.

588
00:41:45.377 --> 00:41:49.672
When I am queen,
I will have the power to get rid of you.

589
00:41:51.175 --> 00:41:53.468
There, now. That's nice.
All settled, then.

590
00:41:53.552 --> 00:41:57.680
Now, Jasmine, getting back
to this suitor business. . . Jasmine?

591
00:41:58.307 --> 00:41:59.682
Jasmine!

592
00:42:01.644 --> 00:42:04.938
If only I had gotten that lamp.

593
00:42:05.022 --> 00:42:08.107
"I will have the power to get rid of you."

594
00:42:09.068 --> 00:42:11.778
To think we gotta keep kissing up

595
00:42:11.862 --> 00:42:15.532
to that chump and his chump daughter

596
00:42:15.616 --> 00:42:18.117
-for the rest of our lives. . .
-No, Iago.

597
00:42:18.202 --> 00:42:21.996
Only until she finds a chump husband.

598
00:42:22.289 --> 00:42:23.915
Then she'll have us banished.

599
00:42:24.833 --> 00:42:26.584
Or beheaded.

600
00:42:29.713 --> 00:42:31.631
Wait a minute. Jafar.

601
00:42:31.715 --> 00:42:34.551
What if you were the chump husband?

602
00:42:34.635 --> 00:42:35.843
What?

603
00:42:35.928 --> 00:42:39.222
Okay, you marry the princess, all right?

604
00:42:39.306 --> 00:42:42.809
And then you become the sultan.

605
00:42:44.728 --> 00:42:47.230
Marry the shrew.

606
00:42:47.314 --> 00:42:49.107
I become the sultan.

607
00:42:49.191 --> 00:42:53.069
-The idea has merit.
-Yes, merit. Yes.

608
00:42:53.153 --> 00:42:59.659
And then we drop papa-in-law
and the little woman off a cliff.

609
00:43:05.165 --> 00:43:08.668
I love the way
your foul little mind works.

610
00:43:17.845 --> 00:43:21.598
Thank you for choosing Magic Carpet
for all your travel needs.

611
00:43:21.682 --> 00:43:25.268
Don't stand until the rug
has come to a complete stop.

612
00:43:25.352 --> 00:43:28.479
Thank you. Goodbye now.
Good-bye. Thank you.

613
00:43:28.564 --> 00:43:32.692
Well, how about that,
Mr Doubting Mustafa?

614
00:43:33.027 --> 00:43:37.697
You sure showed me.
Now, about my three wishes.

615
00:43:37.865 --> 00:43:39.907
Dost mine ears deceive me?

616
00:43:39.992 --> 00:43:43.077
Three? You are down by one, boy.

617
00:43:43.579 --> 00:43:46.956
No. I never actually wished
to get out of the cave.

618
00:43:47.041 --> 00:43:48.791
You did that on your own.

619
00:43:50.961 --> 00:43:53.087
Well, I feel sheepish.

620
00:43:53.213 --> 00:43:56.382
All right, you bad boy,
but no more freebies.

621
00:43:56.508 --> 00:43:59.636
Fair deal. So, three wishes.

622
00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:01.846
I want them to be good.

623
00:44:01.930 --> 00:44:03.640
What would you wish for?

624
00:44:03.724 --> 00:44:05.099
Me?

625
00:44:05.893 --> 00:44:07.977
No one's ever asked me that before.

626
00:44:08.062 --> 00:44:11.356
Well, in my case. . . Forget it.

627
00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:12.982
-What?
-No, I can't. I. . .

628
00:44:13.067 --> 00:44:15.485
Come on. Tell me.

629
00:44:15.569 --> 00:44:17.403
Freedom.

630
00:44:17.488 --> 00:44:18.529
You're a prisoner?

631
00:44:18.614 --> 00:44:20.990
It's all part and parcel
of the whole genie gig.

632
00:44:21.075 --> 00:44:24.744
Phenomenal cosmic powers. . .

633
00:44:24.828 --> 00:44:26.245
Itty bitty living space.

634
00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:28.498
Genie, that's terrible.

635
00:44:28.582 --> 00:44:31.668
But to be free. . .

636
00:44:31.752 --> 00:44:33.628
Not have to go, "What do you need?

637
00:44:33.712 --> 00:44:36.172
"What do you need?
What do you need?"

638
00:44:36.256 --> 00:44:38.174
To be my own master.

639
00:44:38.258 --> 00:44:41.135
Such a thing would be greater
than all the magic

640
00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:44.514
and all the treasures in all the world.

641
00:44:44.598 --> 00:44:45.890
But what am I talking about?

642
00:44:45.974 --> 00:44:48.351
Let's get real here.
It's not gonna happen.

643
00:44:48.435 --> 00:44:50.812
Genie, wake up and smell the hummus.

644
00:44:50.938 --> 00:44:52.146
Why not?

645
00:44:52.231 --> 00:44:56.109
The only way I get outta this
is if my master wishes me out.

646
00:44:56.276 --> 00:44:58.736
So you can guess how often
that's happened.

647
00:44:58.821 --> 00:45:00.488
I'll do it. I'll set you free.

648
00:45:01.115 --> 00:45:04.742
-Yeah, right.
-No, really, I promise.

649
00:45:04.827 --> 00:45:06.411
After I make my first two wishes,

650
00:45:06.495 --> 00:45:08.788
I'll use my third wish to set you free.

651
00:45:09.665 --> 00:45:12.125
Well, here's hopin'. All right.

652
00:45:12.209 --> 00:45:14.335
Let's make some magic.

653
00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:17.130
So how 'bout it?
What is it you want most?

654
00:45:17.881 --> 00:45:21.300
Well, there's this girl.

655
00:45:21.385 --> 00:45:22.427
Wrong.

656
00:45:22.511 --> 00:45:25.263
I can't make anybody
fall in love, remember?

657
00:45:25.347 --> 00:45:29.726
But, Genie, she's smart and fun and. . .

658
00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:31.769
-Pretty?
-Beautiful.

659
00:45:31.854 --> 00:45:35.064
She's got these eyes that just. . .
And this hair.

660
00:45:35.149 --> 00:45:36.816
And her smile. . .

661
00:45:41.321 --> 00:45:43.364
But she's the princess.

662
00:45:43.449 --> 00:45:45.825
To even have a chance, I'd have to be. . .

663
00:45:45.909 --> 00:45:48.703
Hey, can you make me a prince?

664
00:45:48.871 --> 00:45:50.204
Let's see here.

665
00:45:50.289 --> 00:45:53.040
Chicken à la king? Nope.

666
00:45:53.125 --> 00:45:56.294
Alaskan king crab.
I hate it when they do that.

667
00:45:56.378 --> 00:45:59.922
Caesar salad. Et tu, Brute? No.

668
00:46:00.007 --> 00:46:01.799
"To make a prince."

669
00:46:02.342 --> 00:46:04.677
Is that an official wish?
Say the magic words.

670
00:46:04.762 --> 00:46:07.597
Genie, I wish for you
to make me a prince.

671
00:46:07.681 --> 00:46:09.056
All right!

672
00:46:10.517 --> 00:46:14.562
First, that fez-and-vest combo
is much too third century.

673
00:46:14.646 --> 00:46:16.606
These patches.
What are we trying to say, beggar?

674
00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:18.900
No. Let's work with me here.

675
00:46:20.319 --> 00:46:21.652
I like it.

676
00:46:22.362 --> 00:46:25.448
Now, it still needs something.
What does it say to me?

677
00:46:25.532 --> 00:46:28.284
It says mode of transportation.

678
00:46:28.368 --> 00:46:32.413
Excuse me, monkey boy.
Aquí. Over here.

679
00:46:32.498 --> 00:46:33.539
Here he comes.

680
00:46:33.624 --> 00:46:36.501
What better way to make your
entrance on the streets of Agrabah

681
00:46:36.585 --> 00:46:40.171
than riding
your very own, brand-new camel?

682
00:46:40.255 --> 00:46:41.547
Watch out. They spit.

683
00:46:42.633 --> 00:46:43.633
Not enough.

684
00:46:44.885 --> 00:46:48.387
Still not enough.
Let's see. What do you need?

685
00:46:49.765 --> 00:46:50.932
Yes!

686
00:46:55.729 --> 00:46:58.356
Talk about your trunk space.
Check this action out.

687
00:47:06.198 --> 00:47:07.865
Abu, you look good.

688
00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:10.159
He's got the outfit.
He's got the elephant.

689
00:47:10.244 --> 00:47:12.245
But we're not through yet.

690
00:47:12.329 --> 00:47:16.874
Hang on to your turban, kid.
We're gonna make you a star.

691
00:47:25.217 --> 00:47:29.262
Sire, I've found a solution
to the problem with your daughter.

692
00:47:29.888 --> 00:47:31.764
The problem with your daughter.

693
00:47:32.599 --> 00:47:33.641
Really?

694
00:47:33.725 --> 00:47:35.059
Right here.

695
00:47:35.644 --> 00:47:39.522
"If the princess has not chosen
a husband by the appointed time,

696
00:47:39.606 --> 00:47:42.567
"then the sultan shall choose for her."

697
00:47:42.651 --> 00:47:45.903
But Jasmine hated all those suitors.

698
00:47:45.988 --> 00:47:47.989
How could I choose someone
she hates?

699
00:47:48.073 --> 00:47:50.449
Not to worry, my liege. There is more.

700
00:47:51.827 --> 00:47:54.829
"If in the event
a suitable prince cannot be found. . ."

701
00:47:54.913 --> 00:47:55.913
Jerk.

702
00:47:55.998 --> 00:47:59.458
"A princess must then be wed to. . ."

703
00:48:01.879 --> 00:48:03.087
Interesting.

704
00:48:03.213 --> 00:48:04.881
What? Who?

705
00:48:04.965 --> 00:48:06.507
The royal vizier.

706
00:48:06.592 --> 00:48:09.927
Why, that would be me.

707
00:48:11.555 --> 00:48:15.349
But I thought the law says
that only a prince can marry a princess.

708
00:48:15.434 --> 00:48:16.726
I'm quite sure that. . .

709
00:48:16.810 --> 00:48:20.438
Desperate times call
for desperate measures, my lord.

710
00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:23.983
Yes. Desperate measures.

711
00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:28.571
You will order the princess to marry me.

712
00:48:28.655 --> 00:48:33.367
I will order the princess to. . .

713
00:48:34.036 --> 00:48:36.412
But you're so old.

714
00:48:36.496 --> 00:48:39.624
The princess will marry me.

715
00:48:40.125 --> 00:48:41.626
The princess will marry. . .

716
00:48:42.419 --> 00:48:44.378
What? What is that?

717
00:48:44.463 --> 00:48:45.755
That music.

718
00:48:50.093 --> 00:48:52.678
Jafar, you must come and see this.

719
00:48:55.557 --> 00:48:59.518
Make way for Prince Ali

720
00:49:00.729 --> 00:49:06.442
Say, "Hey, it's Prince Ali"

721
00:49:06.568 --> 00:49:08.653
Hey, clear the way in the old bazaar

722
00:49:08.737 --> 00:49:11.322
Hey you, let us through
It's a bright new star

723
00:49:11.406 --> 00:49:14.992
Oh come, be the first on your block
To meet his eye

724
00:49:16.578 --> 00:49:19.163
Make way, here he comes
Ring bells, bang the drums

725
00:49:19.247 --> 00:49:21.040
You're gonna love this guy

726
00:49:21.291 --> 00:49:26.170
Prince Ali, fabulous he
Ali Ababwa

727
00:49:26.296 --> 00:49:30.383
Genuflect, show some respect
Down on one knee

728
00:49:31.218 --> 00:49:33.761
Now, try your best to stay calm

729
00:49:33.845 --> 00:49:35.930
Brush up your Sunday salaam

730
00:49:36.014 --> 00:49:40.434
Then come and meet
His spectacular coterie

731
00:49:40.519 --> 00:49:45.189
Prince Ali, mighty is he
Ali Ababwa

732
00:49:45.273 --> 00:49:49.193
Strong as 1 0 regular men definitely

733
00:49:50.237 --> 00:49:52.321
He faced the galloping hordes

734
00:49:52.572 --> 00:49:54.699
A hundred bad guys with swords

735
00:49:54.908 --> 00:49:59.161
Who sent those goons to their lords?
Why, Prince Ali

736
00:49:59.246 --> 00:50:02.498
He's got 75 golden camels

737
00:50:02.582 --> 00:50:04.041
Don't they look lovely, June?

738
00:50:04.126 --> 00:50:06.919
Purple peacocks, he's got 53

739
00:50:07.004 --> 00:50:08.587
Fabulous, Harry. I love the feathers.

740
00:50:08.672 --> 00:50:13.217
When it comes to exotic-type mammals

741
00:50:13.301 --> 00:50:15.177
Has he got a zoo
I'm telling you

742
00:50:15.262 --> 00:50:17.513
It's a world-class menagerie

743
00:50:17.597 --> 00:50:22.018
Prince Ali, handsome is he
Ali Ababwa

744
00:50:22.102 --> 00:50:26.814
That physique, how can I speak
Weak at the knee

745
00:50:26.898 --> 00:50:29.066
Well, get on out in that square

746
00:50:29.151 --> 00:50:31.318
Adjust your veil and prepare

747
00:50:31.403 --> 00:50:35.489
To gawk and grovel and stare
At Prince Ali

748
00:50:35.574 --> 00:50:39.660
-He's got 95 white Persian monkeys
-He's got the monkeys

749
00:50:39.745 --> 00:50:43.372
-Let's see the monkeys
-And to view them he charges no fee

750
00:50:43.457 --> 00:50:44.957
He's generous
So generous

751
00:50:45.042 --> 00:50:48.419
He's got slaves
He's got servants and flunkies

752
00:50:48.545 --> 00:50:51.172
Proud to work for him
They bow to his whim, love serving him

753
00:50:51.256 --> 00:50:55.217
They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali

754
00:50:55.302 --> 00:50:58.054
Prince Ali

755
00:50:58.138 --> 00:51:04.727
Prince Ali, Amorous he
Ali Ababwa

756
00:51:04.811 --> 00:51:09.148
Heard your princess
Was a sight lovely to see

757
00:51:09.232 --> 00:51:11.233
And that, good people, is why

758
00:51:11.318 --> 00:51:13.402
He got dolled up and dropped by

759
00:51:13.487 --> 00:51:15.404
With 60 elephants, llamas galore

760
00:51:15.489 --> 00:51:17.698
With bears and lions
A brass band and more

761
00:51:17.783 --> 00:51:19.450
With his 40 fakirs
His cooks, his bakers

762
00:51:19.534 --> 00:51:21.243
His birds that warble on key

763
00:51:21.328 --> 00:51:23.412
Make way

764
00:51:23.497 --> 00:51:29.710
For Prince Ali

765
00:51:30.962 --> 00:51:34.423
Splendid. Absolutely marvellous.

766
00:51:36.009 --> 00:51:37.968
Your Majesty,

767
00:51:38.053 --> 00:51:40.638
I have journeyed from afar
to seek your daughter's hand.

768
00:51:40.722 --> 00:51:42.473
Prince Ali Ababwa.

769
00:51:42.557 --> 00:51:45.643
Of course. I'm delighted to meet you.

770
00:51:45.727 --> 00:51:49.688
This is my royal vizier, Jafar.
He's delighted, too.

771
00:51:50.023 --> 00:51:51.690
Ecstatic.

772
00:51:51.775 --> 00:51:54.735
-I'm afraid, Prince Abubu. . .
-Ababwa.

773
00:51:54.820 --> 00:51:55.986
Whatever.

774
00:51:56.071 --> 00:51:59.156
You cannot just parade in here
uninvited and expect to. . .

775
00:51:59.241 --> 00:52:02.576
By Allah,
this is quite a remarkable device.

776
00:52:04.412 --> 00:52:07.581
I don't suppose I might. . .

777
00:52:08.083 --> 00:52:10.793
Why, certainly, Your Majesty.
Allow me.

778
00:52:12.337 --> 00:52:15.089
Sire, I must advise against this.

779
00:52:15.215 --> 00:52:18.175
Button up, Jafar.
Learn to have a little fun.

780
00:52:22.556 --> 00:52:24.265
Look out, here I come.

781
00:52:27.185 --> 00:52:31.397
Just where did you say you were from?

782
00:52:32.732 --> 00:52:36.235
Much farther than
you've travelled, I'm sure.

783
00:52:36.319 --> 00:52:38.571
-Try me.
-Look out, Polly.

784
00:52:41.158 --> 00:52:42.324
Hey, watch it.

785
00:52:42.409 --> 00:52:44.410
Watch it with the dumb rug.

786
00:52:54.671 --> 00:52:56.547
Out of the way. I'm coming in to land.

787
00:52:56.631 --> 00:52:58.465
Jafar, watch this.

788
00:52:58.550 --> 00:53:01.010
-Spectacular, Your Highness.
-That was lovely.

789
00:53:01.928 --> 00:53:05.764
Yes, I do seem to have a knack for it.

790
00:53:05.849 --> 00:53:08.225
This is a very impressive youth.

791
00:53:08.310 --> 00:53:10.561
And a prince besides.

792
00:53:10.645 --> 00:53:14.231
If we're lucky, you won't
have to marry Jasmine after all.

793
00:53:14.316 --> 00:53:17.026
-I don't trust him, Sire.
-Nonsense.

794
00:53:17.110 --> 00:53:21.697
One thing I pride myself on, Jafar,
I'm an excellent judge of character.

795
00:53:21.781 --> 00:53:24.450
Excellent judge. Yeah, sure. Not!

796
00:53:25.952 --> 00:53:28.078
Jasmine will like this one.

797
00:53:28.163 --> 00:53:30.331
And I'm pretty sure
I'll like Princess Jasmine.

798
00:53:30.415 --> 00:53:34.585
Your Highness, no.
I must intercede on Jasmine's behalf.

799
00:53:34.711 --> 00:53:36.879
This boy is no different from the others.

800
00:53:36.963 --> 00:53:39.673
What makes him think
he is worthy of the princess?

801
00:53:39.758 --> 00:53:43.010
Your Majesty, I am Prince Ali Ababwa.

802
00:53:43.094 --> 00:53:46.055
Just let her meet me.
I will win your daughter.

803
00:53:46.139 --> 00:53:47.681
How dare you.

804
00:53:47.891 --> 00:53:51.602
All of you.
Standing around deciding my future?

805
00:53:51.728 --> 00:53:54.480
I am not a prize to be won.

806
00:53:55.023 --> 00:53:56.857
Oh, dear.

807
00:53:57.901 --> 00:54:02.321
Don't worry, Prince Ali.
Just give Jasmine time to cool down.

808
00:54:02.530 --> 00:54:07.451
I think it's time to say good-bye
to Prince Abubu.

809
00:54:11.998 --> 00:54:13.207
What am I gonna do?

810
00:54:13.291 --> 00:54:15.668
Jasmine won't even let me talk to her.

811
00:54:15.752 --> 00:54:19.338
I should've known I couldn't pull off
this stupid prince wish.

812
00:54:22.759 --> 00:54:24.510
So move.

813
00:54:26.012 --> 00:54:27.012
Hey.

814
00:54:28.598 --> 00:54:30.099
That's a good move.

815
00:54:30.183 --> 00:54:32.518
I can't believe it. I'm losing to a rug.

816
00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:34.645
Genie, I need help.

817
00:54:34.729 --> 00:54:37.439
All right, Sparky, here's the deal.

818
00:54:37.524 --> 00:54:40.859
If you wanna court the little lady,
you gotta be a straight shooter.

819
00:54:40.944 --> 00:54:43.362
-Do you got it?
-What?

820
00:54:46.116 --> 00:54:47.324
No way.

821
00:54:47.409 --> 00:54:51.620
If Jasmine found out I was really
some crummy street rat,

822
00:54:51.705 --> 00:54:52.871
she'd laugh at me.

823
00:54:52.956 --> 00:54:55.416
A woman appreciates a man
who can make her laugh.

824
00:54:56.751 --> 00:55:01.088
Al, all joking aside,
you really ought to be yourself.

825
00:55:01.172 --> 00:55:03.090
Hey, that's the last thing I wanna be.

826
00:55:03.466 --> 00:55:05.301
Okay, I'm gonna go see her.

827
00:55:05.385 --> 00:55:09.555
I gotta be smooth, cool, confident.

828
00:55:11.057 --> 00:55:12.725
How do I look?

829
00:55:13.852 --> 00:55:16.395
Like a prince.

830
00:55:29.075 --> 00:55:30.409
Princess Jasmine?

831
00:55:32.412 --> 00:55:35.289
-Who's there?
-It's me, Prince Ali.

832
00:55:36.499 --> 00:55:38.917
Prince Ali Ababwa.

833
00:55:39.002 --> 00:55:40.586
I do not want to see you.

834
00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:42.963
No, no, please, Princess.
Give me a chance.

835
00:55:43.048 --> 00:55:45.799
-Just leave me alone.
-Down, kitty.

836
00:55:46.343 --> 00:55:48.427
So, how's our little beau doing?

837
00:55:49.846 --> 00:55:51.472
Good kitty, take off.

838
00:55:52.349 --> 00:55:53.474
Down, kitty.

839
00:55:53.558 --> 00:55:54.933
Wait. Wait.

840
00:55:55.018 --> 00:55:57.269
Do I know you?

841
00:55:57.937 --> 00:55:59.605
No. No.

842
00:56:00.231 --> 00:56:04.318
You remind me of someone
I met in the marketplace.

843
00:56:04.402 --> 00:56:06.779
The marketplace?

844
00:56:06.863 --> 00:56:09.198
I have servants who go
to the marketplace for me.

845
00:56:10.283 --> 00:56:13.869
Why, I even have servants who go to
the marketplace for my servants,

846
00:56:13.953 --> 00:56:15.537
so it couldn't have been me you met.

847
00:56:16.498 --> 00:56:19.958
No. I guess not.

848
00:56:20.168 --> 00:56:22.878
Enough about you, Casanova.
Talk about her.

849
00:56:22.962 --> 00:56:25.672
She's smart, fun, the hair, the eyes.

850
00:56:25.757 --> 00:56:27.341
Anything. Pick a feature.

851
00:56:28.134 --> 00:56:30.260
Princess Jasmine? You're very. . .

852
00:56:30.345 --> 00:56:32.054
Wonderful, magnificent, glorious,

853
00:56:32.138 --> 00:56:33.430
-punctual.
-Punctual.

854
00:56:33.515 --> 00:56:34.681
-Punctual?
-Sorry.

855
00:56:35.266 --> 00:56:37.267
-Beautiful.
-Nice recovery.

856
00:56:38.436 --> 00:56:40.020
I'm rich, too, you know.

857
00:56:40.814 --> 00:56:43.565
-Yeah.
-The daughter of a sultan.

858
00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:45.818
I know.

859
00:56:45.902 --> 00:56:48.821
A fine prize for any prince to marry.

860
00:56:49.864 --> 00:56:52.157
Right. Right. A prince like me.

861
00:56:52.242 --> 00:56:53.826
Warning ! Warning !

862
00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:55.994
Right. A prince like you.

863
00:56:56.704 --> 00:57:00.332
And every other stuffed shirt,
swaggering peacock I've met.

864
00:57:00.417 --> 00:57:02.126
Mayday! Mayday!

865
00:57:03.503 --> 00:57:06.004
Just go jump off a balcony!

866
00:57:06.172 --> 00:57:08.340
-What?
-Stop her. Stop her!

867
00:57:08.425 --> 00:57:10.217
-Want me to sting her?
-Buzz off.

868
00:57:10.301 --> 00:57:14.096
Okay, fine.
But remember, "bee" yourself.

869
00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:15.931
-Yeah, right.
-What?

870
00:57:17.475 --> 00:57:18.684
You're right.

871
00:57:20.645 --> 00:57:23.272
You aren't just some prize to be won.

872
00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:26.024
You should be free
to make your own choice.

873
00:57:26.776 --> 00:57:27.985
I'll go now.

874
00:57:28.069 --> 00:57:30.070
-No!
-What? What?

875
00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:31.947
How. . .

876
00:57:32.031 --> 00:57:33.699
How are you doing that?

877
00:57:33.783 --> 00:57:36.702
-It's a magic carpet.
-It's lovely.

878
00:57:38.163 --> 00:57:39.746
You. . .

879
00:57:39.831 --> 00:57:42.583
You don't want to go for a ride, do you?

880
00:57:42.667 --> 00:57:45.586
We could get out of the palace,
see the world.

881
00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:47.963
-Is it safe?
-Sure. Do you trust me?

882
00:57:49.799 --> 00:57:52.050
-What?
-Do you trust me?

883
00:57:54.554 --> 00:57:55.888
Yes.

884
00:58:11.613 --> 00:58:14.948
I can show you the world

885
00:58:15.658 --> 00:58:19.411
Shining, shimmering, splendid

886
00:58:19.496 --> 00:58:21.121
Tell me, Princess

887
00:58:21.247 --> 00:58:27.169
Now, when did you last
Let your heart decide

888
00:58:27.253 --> 00:58:31.131
I can open your eyes

889
00:58:31.257 --> 00:58:34.593
Take you wonder by wonder

890
00:58:35.011 --> 00:58:37.846
Over, sideways and under

891
00:58:37.931 --> 00:58:41.433
On a magic carpet ride

892
00:58:41.518 --> 00:58:45.437
A whole new world

893
00:58:45.522 --> 00:58:49.107
A new fantastic point of view

894
00:58:49.275 --> 00:58:54.029
No one to tell us no
Or where to go

895
00:58:54.113 --> 00:58:56.782
Or say we're only dreaming

896
00:58:56.866 --> 00:59:00.619
A whole new world

897
00:59:00.703 --> 00:59:04.706
A dazzling place
l never knew

898
00:59:04.791 --> 00:59:09.294
But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear

899
00:59:09.379 --> 00:59:13.549
That now l'm in
A whole new world with you

900
00:59:13.633 --> 00:59:17.261
Now l'm in
A whole new world with you

901
00:59:17.345 --> 00:59:21.098
Unbelievable sights

902
00:59:21.266 --> 00:59:24.810
Indescribable feeling

903
00:59:24.894 --> 00:59:27.896
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling

904
00:59:27.981 --> 00:59:31.066
Through an endless diamond sky

905
00:59:31.192 --> 00:59:35.070
-A whole new world
-Don't you dare close your eyes

906
00:59:35.154 --> 00:59:38.907
-A hundred thousand things to see
-Hold your breath, it gets better

907
00:59:38.992 --> 00:59:43.245
I'm like a shooting star
l've come so far

908
00:59:43.329 --> 00:59:46.707
I can't go back to where I used to be

909
00:59:46.791 --> 00:59:50.002
-A whole new world
-Every turn a surprise

910
00:59:50.086 --> 00:59:54.089
-With new horizons to pursue
-Every moment red-letter

911
00:59:54.173 --> 00:59:58.677
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare

912
00:59:58.761 --> 01:00:05.434
Let me share
This whole new world with you

913
01:00:05.518 --> 01:00:09.229
-A whole new world
-A whole new world

914
01:00:09.314 --> 01:00:13.275
-That's where we'll be
-That's where we'll be

915
01:00:13.359 --> 01:00:17.571
-A thrilling chase
-A wondrous place

916
01:00:17.655 --> 01:00:21.366
For you and me

917
01:00:35.715 --> 01:00:38.759
-It's all so magical.
-Yeah.

918
01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:43.555
It's a shame Abu had to miss this.

919
01:00:43.723 --> 01:00:45.807
Nah. He hates fireworks.

920
01:00:45.975 --> 01:00:47.809
He doesn't like flying, either.

921
01:00:48.978 --> 01:00:51.897
That is. . . Oh, no.

922
01:00:51.981 --> 01:00:54.149
You are the boy from the market.
I knew it.

923
01:00:54.233 --> 01:00:56.568
-Why did you lie to me?
-Jasmine, I'm sorry.

924
01:00:56.653 --> 01:00:58.362
-Did you think I was stupid?
-No.

925
01:00:58.446 --> 01:01:00.364
-That I wouldn't figure it out?
-No.

926
01:01:00.448 --> 01:01:04.576
I mean, I hoped you wouldn't.
No, that's not what I meant.

927
01:01:04.661 --> 01:01:06.662
Who are you? Tell me the truth.

928
01:01:06.746 --> 01:01:08.413
The truth?

929
01:01:10.583 --> 01:01:12.042
The truth.

930
01:01:13.586 --> 01:01:15.295
The truth is. . .

931
01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:18.382
I sometimes dress as a commoner

932
01:01:18.466 --> 01:01:20.926
to escape the pressures of palace life.

933
01:01:23.096 --> 01:01:25.013
But I really am a prince.

934
01:01:26.391 --> 01:01:28.392
Why didn't you just tell me?

935
01:01:28.768 --> 01:01:31.061
Well, you know,

936
01:01:31.145 --> 01:01:33.689
royalty going out into the city
in disguise,

937
01:01:33.773 --> 01:01:36.274
it sounds a little strange,
don't you think?

938
01:01:38.236 --> 01:01:39.778
Not that strange.

939
01:02:02.635 --> 01:02:05.429
Good night, my handsome prince.

940
01:02:05.805 --> 01:02:07.222
Sleep well, Princess.

941
01:02:31.164 --> 01:02:32.873
Yes!

942
01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:41.423
For the first time in my life,
things are starting to go right.

943
01:02:45.970 --> 01:02:47.596
Abu. Abu.

944
01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:49.264
Hold him.

945
01:02:54.312 --> 01:02:57.355
I'm afraid you've worn out
your welcome, Prince Abubu.

946
01:02:57.690 --> 01:02:58.982
Why, you. . .

947
01:02:59.066 --> 01:03:01.526
Make sure he's never found.

948
01:03:45.238 --> 01:03:48.156
Never fails. You get in the bath
and there's a rub at the lamp.

949
01:03:48.241 --> 01:03:50.450
Hello? Al?

950
01:03:51.452 --> 01:03:53.620
Al ! Kid, snap out of it.

951
01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:56.998
You can't cheat on this one.
I can't help unless you make a wish.

952
01:03:57.083 --> 01:04:00.585
You have to say, "Genie,
I want you to save my life." Got it?

953
01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:02.838
Come on, Aladdin !

954
01:04:03.464 --> 01:04:04.881
I'll take that as a yes.

955
01:04:06.634 --> 01:04:08.093
Up scope.

956
01:04:18.062 --> 01:04:20.313
Don't you scare me like that.

957
01:04:20.398 --> 01:04:22.274
Genie, I. . .

958
01:04:23.693 --> 01:04:25.235
I. . .

959
01:04:26.779 --> 01:04:29.030
-Thanks, Genie.
-Oh, Al.

960
01:04:29.115 --> 01:04:31.199
I'm gettin' kind of fond of you, kid.

961
01:04:31.784 --> 01:04:34.160
Not that I wanna pick out
curtains or anything.

962
01:04:40.293 --> 01:04:42.085
Jasmine.

963
01:04:42.169 --> 01:04:46.089
Father, I just had
the most wonderful time.

964
01:04:46.173 --> 01:04:49.885
-I'm so happy.
-You should be, Jasmine.

965
01:04:49.969 --> 01:04:53.013
I have chosen a husband for you.

966
01:04:53.097 --> 01:04:55.765
-What?
-You will wed Jafar.

967
01:04:57.435 --> 01:05:00.604
You're speechless, I see.
A fine quality in a wife.

968
01:05:00.688 --> 01:05:02.480
I will never marry you.

969
01:05:03.065 --> 01:05:06.735
-Father, I choose Prince Ali.
-Prince Ali left.

970
01:05:06.819 --> 01:05:08.945
Better check
your crystal ball again, Jafar.

971
01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:10.739
Prince Ali !

972
01:05:10.823 --> 01:05:13.325
How in the. . .

973
01:05:13.951 --> 01:05:17.329
Tell them the truth, Jafar.
You tried to have me killed.

974
01:05:17.413 --> 01:05:20.498
What? Ridiculous nonsense,
Your Highness.

975
01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:22.709
He is obviously lying.

976
01:05:22.793 --> 01:05:25.211
Obviously lying.

977
01:05:25.296 --> 01:05:27.339
Father, what's wrong with you?

978
01:05:27.423 --> 01:05:29.049
I know what's wrong.

979
01:05:31.093 --> 01:05:32.260
Oh, my!

980
01:05:32.345 --> 01:05:35.055
Your Highness,
Jafar's been controlling you with this.

981
01:05:35.848 --> 01:05:38.099
What? Jafar?

982
01:05:38.184 --> 01:05:40.602
You, you traitor!

983
01:05:40.686 --> 01:05:42.812
Your Majesty, all this can be explained.

984
01:05:42.897 --> 01:05:44.940
Guards! Guards!

985
01:05:45.024 --> 01:05:47.150
Well, that's it. We're dead. Forget it.

986
01:05:47.234 --> 01:05:49.110
Just dig a grave for both of us.
We're dead.

987
01:05:49.195 --> 01:05:51.363
Arrest Jafar at once.

988
01:05:52.323 --> 01:05:54.532
This is not done yet, boy.

989
01:05:58.454 --> 01:06:01.957
Find him ! Search everywhere!

990
01:06:02.041 --> 01:06:04.542
-Jasmine, are you all right?
-Yes.

991
01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:07.587
Jafar, my most trusted counsellor,

992
01:06:07.672 --> 01:06:09.172
plotting against me all this time.

993
01:06:09.256 --> 01:06:11.591
This is horrible, just horrible.

994
01:06:11.676 --> 01:06:13.760
How will I ever. . .

995
01:06:16.222 --> 01:06:17.806
Can this be true?

996
01:06:17.890 --> 01:06:21.434
My daughter has finally
chosen a suitor?

997
01:06:22.812 --> 01:06:24.688
Praise Allah !

998
01:06:26.023 --> 01:06:28.566
You brilliant boy, I could kiss you.

999
01:06:28.651 --> 01:06:30.735
I won't. I'll leave that to my. . .

1000
01:06:31.404 --> 01:06:33.822
But you two will be wed at once.

1001
01:06:33.906 --> 01:06:37.075
Yes, yes. And you'll be happy
and prosperous,

1002
01:06:37.159 --> 01:06:40.453
and then you, my boy,
will become sultan.

1003
01:06:40.538 --> 01:06:41.705
-Sultan?
-Yes.

1004
01:06:41.789 --> 01:06:44.040
A fine upstanding youth
such as yourself,

1005
01:06:44.125 --> 01:06:46.501
a person of your unimpeachable
moral character

1006
01:06:46.585 --> 01:06:49.754
is exactly what this kingdom needs.

1007
01:06:50.464 --> 01:06:54.092
We gotta get outta here.
I gotta start packing. Only essentials.

1008
01:06:54.176 --> 01:06:55.176
We gotta travel light.

1009
01:06:55.261 --> 01:06:58.513
Bring the guns, the weapons,
the knives, and how about this picture?

1010
01:06:58.597 --> 01:07:01.016
I think I'm making a weird face in it.

1011
01:07:04.311 --> 01:07:07.939
Oh, boy. He's cracked. He's gone nuts.

1012
01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:11.609
Jafar! Jafar! Get a grip!

1013
01:07:12.695 --> 01:07:13.695
Good grip.

1014
01:07:13.779 --> 01:07:17.699
Prince Ali is nothing more than
that ragged urchin, Aladdin.

1015
01:07:17.783 --> 01:07:20.910
-He has the lamp, Iago.
-Why, that miserable. . .

1016
01:07:20.995 --> 01:07:23.580
But you are going to relieve him of it.

1017
01:07:23.664 --> 01:07:24.748
Me?

1018
01:07:28.669 --> 01:07:30.670
Sultan?

1019
01:07:30.755 --> 01:07:32.088
They want me to be Sultan?

1020
01:07:35.092 --> 01:07:37.802
Hail the conquering hero

1021
01:07:45.478 --> 01:07:48.396
Aladdin, you've just won
the heart of the princess.

1022
01:07:48.481 --> 01:07:50.523
What are you gonna do next?

1023
01:07:57.323 --> 01:08:01.034
Your line is,
"I'm going to free the genie."

1024
01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:02.744
Any time.

1025
01:08:02.828 --> 01:08:06.206
-Genie. I can't.
-Sure you can.

1026
01:08:06.290 --> 01:08:09.709
You just go, "Genie, I wish you free."

1027
01:08:09.794 --> 01:08:11.377
I'm serious.

1028
01:08:11.462 --> 01:08:15.090
Look, I'm sorry. I really am.
But they wanna make me sultan.

1029
01:08:15.174 --> 01:08:18.259
No. They wanna make Prince Ali sultan.

1030
01:08:18.344 --> 01:08:20.887
Without you, I'm just Aladdin.

1031
01:08:20.971 --> 01:08:23.306
-Al, you won.
-Because of you.

1032
01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:26.935
The only reason anyone thinks
I'm worth anything is because of you.

1033
01:08:27.019 --> 01:08:29.187
What if they find out
I'm not really a prince?

1034
01:08:29.271 --> 01:08:32.440
What if Jasmine finds out? I'd lose her.

1035
01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:35.944
Genie, I can't keep this up on my own.

1036
01:08:36.612 --> 01:08:38.780
I can't wish you free.

1037
01:08:40.407 --> 01:08:43.868
Fine. I understand.
After all, you've lied to everyone else.

1038
01:08:43.953 --> 01:08:46.037
Hey, I was beginning to feel left out.

1039
01:08:46.539 --> 01:08:49.332
Now, if you'll excuse me, master.

1040
01:08:53.546 --> 01:08:55.463
Genie, I'm really sorry.

1041
01:08:56.507 --> 01:09:00.301
Well, fine. Then just stay in there.

1042
01:09:02.096 --> 01:09:03.888
What are you guys looking at?

1043
01:09:07.434 --> 01:09:09.519
Look, I'm sorry.

1044
01:09:09.603 --> 01:09:11.771
Abu, I'm sorry. I didn't. . .

1045
01:09:11.856 --> 01:09:13.773
Wait. Come on.

1046
01:09:19.613 --> 01:09:21.239
What am I doing?

1047
01:09:23.534 --> 01:09:25.577
Genie's right.

1048
01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:28.288
I gotta tell Jasmine the truth.

1049
01:09:28.372 --> 01:09:31.541
Ali. Ali. Will you come here?

1050
01:09:32.626 --> 01:09:34.878
Well, here goes.

1051
01:09:35.421 --> 01:09:37.380
Jasmine? Where are you?

1052
01:09:38.132 --> 01:09:40.008
Out in the menagerie. Hurry.

1053
01:09:40.092 --> 01:09:42.093
I'm coming.

1054
01:09:45.723 --> 01:09:48.600
You got a problem, Pinky?

1055
01:09:48.934 --> 01:09:50.059
Jerk.

1056
01:09:53.105 --> 01:09:55.565
Boy, Jafar's gonna be happy to see you.

1057
01:09:55.649 --> 01:09:58.568
"Excellent work, Iago." Go on.

1058
01:09:58.652 --> 01:10:02.488
"No, really. On a scale
of one to 1 0, you are an 1 1 ."

1059
01:10:02.573 --> 01:10:04.908
Jafar, you're too kind.

1060
01:10:04.992 --> 01:10:06.910
I'm embarrassed. I'm blushing.

1061
01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:10.705
People of Agrabah,

1062
01:10:10.789 --> 01:10:15.543
my daughter has finally
chosen a suitor.

1063
01:10:16.837 --> 01:10:18.087
Jasmine.

1064
01:10:18.172 --> 01:10:20.131
Ali, where have you been?

1065
01:10:20.424 --> 01:10:22.383
Jasmine, there's something
I got to tell you.

1066
01:10:22.468 --> 01:10:25.511
The whole kingdom's turned out
for Father's announcement.

1067
01:10:25.596 --> 01:10:28.097
No. But, Jasmine, listen to me, please.

1068
01:10:28.182 --> 01:10:29.724
-You don't understand. . .
-Good luck.

1069
01:10:29.808 --> 01:10:32.727
Ali Ababwa!

1070
01:10:32.811 --> 01:10:34.354
Oh, boy.

1071
01:10:37.316 --> 01:10:41.486
Look at them,
cheering that little pipsqueak.

1072
01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:43.988
Let them cheer.

1073
01:10:45.199 --> 01:10:47.742
You know, Al, I'm getting really. . .

1074
01:10:47.826 --> 01:10:50.578
I don't think you're him.
Tonight, the part of Al

1075
01:10:50.663 --> 01:10:53.414
will be played by a tall, dark
and sinister ugly man.

1076
01:10:53.499 --> 01:10:56.834
-I am your master now.
-I was afraid of that.

1077
01:10:56.919 --> 01:11:00.171
Genie, grant me my first wish.

1078
01:11:00.256 --> 01:11:03.841
I wish to rule on high as sultan.

1079
01:11:09.223 --> 01:11:11.307
Bless my soul.

1080
01:11:11.392 --> 01:11:14.185
What is this? What's going on?

1081
01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:16.437
Oh, my goodness, what's happening?

1082
01:11:16.522 --> 01:11:17.855
Father.

1083
01:11:20.484 --> 01:11:23.611
Jafar, you vile betrayer.

1084
01:11:23.696 --> 01:11:26.781
That's Sultan Vile Betrayer to you.

1085
01:11:26.865 --> 01:11:30.076
Oh, yeah? We'll just see about that.

1086
01:11:30.619 --> 01:11:31.953
The lamp.

1087
01:11:32.371 --> 01:11:35.373
Finders keepers, Abubu.

1088
01:11:50.639 --> 01:11:52.515
Genie, no!

1089
01:11:52.599 --> 01:11:55.226
Sorry, kid. I got a new master now.

1090
01:11:56.562 --> 01:11:59.063
Jafar, I order you to stop.

1091
01:11:59.189 --> 01:12:01.524
But there's a new order now.

1092
01:12:01.608 --> 01:12:03.359
My order.

1093
01:12:03.444 --> 01:12:06.487
Finally, you will bow to me.

1094
01:12:06.655 --> 01:12:08.281
We will never bow to you.

1095
01:12:08.365 --> 01:12:10.658
Why am I not surprised?

1096
01:12:10.743 --> 01:12:13.244
If you won't bow before a sultan,

1097
01:12:13.329 --> 01:12:16.497
then you will cower before a sorcerer!

1098
01:12:16.582 --> 01:12:18.666
Genie, my second wish. . .

1099
01:12:18.917 --> 01:12:24.839
I wish to be the most powerful sorcerer
in the world !

1100
01:12:24.923 --> 01:12:27.091
Genie, stop!

1101
01:12:28.177 --> 01:12:30.178
Ladies and gentlemen,

1102
01:12:30.262 --> 01:12:35.641
a warm Agrabah welcome
for Sorcerer Jafar!

1103
01:12:36.018 --> 01:12:37.935
Now, where were we?

1104
01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:42.273
Yes. Abject humiliation.

1105
01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:45.943
Down, boy.

1106
01:12:48.238 --> 01:12:49.530
Princess.

1107
01:12:49.615 --> 01:12:52.575
There's someone
I'm dying to introduce you to.

1108
01:12:52.659 --> 01:12:54.118
Jafar. Get your hands off her.

1109
01:12:54.203 --> 01:12:56.287
Prince Ali
Yes, it is he

1110
01:12:56.455 --> 01:12:58.748
But not as you know him

1111
01:12:58.832 --> 01:13:02.919
Read my lips
And come to grips with reality

1112
01:13:03.754 --> 01:13:05.922
Yes, meet a blast from your past

1113
01:13:06.006 --> 01:13:08.383
Whose lies were too good to last

1114
01:13:08.467 --> 01:13:11.761
Say hello
To your precious Prince Ali

1115
01:13:11.845 --> 01:13:14.555
Or should we say Aladdin?

1116
01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:15.723
Ali?

1117
01:13:15.808 --> 01:13:19.102
Jasmine, I tried to tell you. I'm just. . .

1118
01:13:19.186 --> 01:13:23.564
So Ali turns out to be
Merely Aladdin

1119
01:13:23.649 --> 01:13:25.650
Just a con, need I go on

1120
01:13:25.734 --> 01:13:28.194
Take it from me

1121
01:13:28.278 --> 01:13:30.405
His personality flaws

1122
01:13:30.489 --> 01:13:32.532
Give me adequate cause

1123
01:13:32.616 --> 01:13:34.575
To send him packing
On a one-way trip

1124
01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:35.660
Genie!

1125
01:13:35.744 --> 01:13:37.245
So his prospects
Take a terminal dip

1126
01:13:37.329 --> 01:13:41.999
His assets frozen, the venue chosen
ls the ends of the Earth!

1127
01:13:43.085 --> 01:13:45.711
-So long !
-Good-bye, see ya.

1128
01:13:45.796 --> 01:13:50.842
Ex-Prince Ali

1129
01:14:15.617 --> 01:14:17.618
Abu.

1130
01:14:18.829 --> 01:14:20.288
Abu !

1131
01:14:24.668 --> 01:14:26.794
This is all my fault.

1132
01:14:26.879 --> 01:14:30.465
I should have freed the genie
when I had the chance.

1133
01:14:30.549 --> 01:14:33.342
Abu. Are you okay?

1134
01:14:34.845 --> 01:14:37.096
I'm sorry, Abu.

1135
01:14:37.181 --> 01:14:39.223
I made a mess of everything.

1136
01:14:39.308 --> 01:14:43.186
Somehow, I gotta go back
and set things right.

1137
01:14:50.986 --> 01:14:52.195
Carpet.

1138
01:14:56.950 --> 01:14:58.784
Abu, start digging.

1139
01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:02.705
That's it.

1140
01:15:20.182 --> 01:15:23.059
Yeah ! All right!

1141
01:15:28.982 --> 01:15:31.317
Now, back to Agrabah. Let's go.

1142
01:15:34.321 --> 01:15:36.948
Puppet ruler want a cracker?

1143
01:15:37.032 --> 01:15:40.117
Here's your cracker. Shove them
all the way down your throat.

1144
01:15:40.202 --> 01:15:41.494
Here. Have lots.

1145
01:15:41.578 --> 01:15:45.164
Stop it. Jafar, leave him alone.

1146
01:15:47.334 --> 01:15:51.254
It pains me to see you
reduced to this, Jasmine.

1147
01:15:53.215 --> 01:15:55.466
A beautiful desert bloom
such as yourself

1148
01:15:55.551 --> 01:15:59.303
should be on the arm of the most
powerful man in the world.

1149
01:15:59.763 --> 01:16:01.597
What do you say, my dear?

1150
01:16:01.682 --> 01:16:04.225
Why, with you as my queen. . .

1151
01:16:04.309 --> 01:16:05.685
Never.

1152
01:16:07.187 --> 01:16:09.647
I'll teach you some respect.

1153
01:16:12.150 --> 01:16:14.193
No. Genie.

1154
01:16:15.487 --> 01:16:17.822
I have decided to make my final wish.

1155
01:16:18.156 --> 01:16:20.950
I wish for Princess Jasmine

1156
01:16:21.034 --> 01:16:23.953
to fall desperately in love with me.

1157
01:16:30.168 --> 01:16:33.629
Master, there are a few addendas,
some quid pro quos. . .

1158
01:16:33.714 --> 01:16:35.798
Don't talk back to me, you big blue lout.

1159
01:16:36.174 --> 01:16:41.012
You will do what I order you to do, slave.

1160
01:16:41.305 --> 01:16:43.514
Jafar.

1161
01:16:44.558 --> 01:16:50.021
I never realised how
incredibly handsome you are.

1162
01:16:52.691 --> 01:16:54.233
That's better.

1163
01:16:55.485 --> 01:16:58.279
Now, pussycat,

1164
01:16:58.363 --> 01:17:01.282
tell me more about myself.

1165
01:17:01.366 --> 01:17:05.870
You're tall, dark,

1166
01:17:07.164 --> 01:17:08.956
well dressed. . .

1167
01:17:09.041 --> 01:17:11.375
Al. Al, little buddy.

1168
01:17:16.048 --> 01:17:17.715
Al, I can't help you.

1169
01:17:17.799 --> 01:17:20.801
I work for Señor Psychopath now.
What are you gonna do?

1170
01:17:20.886 --> 01:17:24.805
Hey, I'm a street rat, remember?
I'll improvise.

1171
01:17:24.890 --> 01:17:27.933
Cute little gaps between your teeth.

1172
01:17:28.852 --> 01:17:30.478
Go on.

1173
01:17:30.562 --> 01:17:35.983
And your beard is so twisted.

1174
01:17:37.527 --> 01:17:41.739
-You've stolen my heart.
-Jafar. . .

1175
01:17:41.823 --> 01:17:45.493
And the street rat?

1176
01:17:45.577 --> 01:17:47.578
What street rat?

1177
01:17:59.383 --> 01:18:01.050
That was. . .

1178
01:18:03.845 --> 01:18:05.513
You !

1179
01:18:06.056 --> 01:18:09.350
How many times
do I have to kill you, boy?

1180
01:18:13.271 --> 01:18:14.438
Get the lamp.

1181
01:18:15.941 --> 01:18:17.400
No!

1182
01:18:18.276 --> 01:18:20.861
Princess. Your time is up.

1183
01:18:24.491 --> 01:18:25.825
Jasmine.

1184
01:18:27.452 --> 01:18:29.161
Nice shot. . .

1185
01:18:31.123 --> 01:18:33.332
Don't toy with me.

1186
01:18:34.668 --> 01:18:35.710
Abu !

1187
01:18:35.794 --> 01:18:38.963
Things are unravelling fast now, boy.

1188
01:18:41.925 --> 01:18:43.551
Get the point?

1189
01:18:49.391 --> 01:18:51.434
I'm just getting warmed up.

1190
01:18:54.521 --> 01:18:57.815
Are you afraid to fight me yourself,
you cowardly snake?

1191
01:18:58.650 --> 01:19:01.152
A snake, am I?

1192
01:19:01.236 --> 01:19:06.157
Perhaps you'd like to see
how snakelike I can be.

1193
01:19:23.133 --> 01:19:25.384
Rick 'em, rack 'em, rock 'em, rake
Stick that sword into that snake

1194
01:19:25.469 --> 01:19:27.094
You stay out of this.

1195
01:19:27.179 --> 01:19:30.431
Jafar, Jafar, he's our man.
If he can't do it. . . Great!

1196
01:19:34.728 --> 01:19:36.353
Aladdin.

1197
01:19:46.948 --> 01:19:48.407
Jasmine, hang on.

1198
01:19:51.161 --> 01:19:53.454
You little fool.

1199
01:19:54.623 --> 01:19:59.752
You thought you could defeat
the most powerful being on Earth.

1200
01:19:59.836 --> 01:20:03.255
Squeeze him, Jafar.
Squeeze him like a. . .

1201
01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:07.468
Without the genie, boy, you're nothing.

1202
01:20:07.552 --> 01:20:10.262
The genie. The genie.

1203
01:20:11.181 --> 01:20:13.265
The genie has more power
than you'll ever have.

1204
01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:14.350
What?

1205
01:20:14.434 --> 01:20:17.186
He gave you your power.
He can take it away.

1206
01:20:17.395 --> 01:20:19.980
Al, what are you doing?
Why are you bringing me into this?

1207
01:20:20.065 --> 01:20:23.776
Face it, Jafar.
You're still just second best.

1208
01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:26.320
You're right.

1209
01:20:26.404 --> 01:20:29.490
His power does exceed my own.

1210
01:20:29.991 --> 01:20:32.368
But not for long.

1211
01:20:32.452 --> 01:20:35.538
The boy is crazy.
He's a little punch-drunk.

1212
01:20:35.622 --> 01:20:37.122
One too many hits with the snake.

1213
01:20:37.374 --> 01:20:40.084
Slave, I make my third wish.

1214
01:20:40.293 --> 01:20:44.463
I wish to be an all-powerful genie!

1215
01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:51.846
All right, your wish is my command.
Way to go, Al.

1216
01:20:57.394 --> 01:20:59.353
Yes.

1217
01:21:00.772 --> 01:21:02.523
Yes!

1218
01:21:02.607 --> 01:21:04.275
The power.

1219
01:21:06.903 --> 01:21:11.866
The absolute power!

1220
01:21:11.950 --> 01:21:14.285
-What have you done?
-Trust me.

1221
01:21:15.412 --> 01:21:20.457
The universe is mine to command,
to control !

1222
01:21:20.542 --> 01:21:23.961
Not so fast, Jafar.
Aren't you forgetting something?

1223
01:21:24.588 --> 01:21:27.381
You wanted to be a genie, you got it.

1224
01:21:27.465 --> 01:21:28.674
What?

1225
01:21:28.758 --> 01:21:30.885
And everything that goes with it.

1226
01:21:31.469 --> 01:21:34.722
-No! No!
-I'm gettin' out of here.

1227
01:21:34.806 --> 01:21:36.724
Phenomenal cosmic powers. . .

1228
01:21:36.808 --> 01:21:39.768
You're the genie. I don't want. . .

1229
01:21:39.853 --> 01:21:41.270
Itty bitty living space.

1230
01:21:41.646 --> 01:21:44.565
Al, you little genius, you.

1231
01:21:59.581 --> 01:22:01.749
Get your blasted beak out of my face.

1232
01:22:01.833 --> 01:22:05.419
-Shut up, you moron.
-Don't tell me to shut up.

1233
01:22:05.503 --> 01:22:06.670
Allow me.

1234
01:22:06.755 --> 01:22:10.758
Ten thousand years in a
Cave of Wonders ought to chill him out.

1235
01:22:12.886 --> 01:22:15.054
Shut up!

1236
01:22:20.977 --> 01:22:22.519
Jasmine. . .

1237
01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:25.940
I'm sorry I lied to you
about being a prince.

1238
01:22:26.441 --> 01:22:27.816
I know why you did.

1239
01:22:29.653 --> 01:22:34.490
Well, I guess this is good-bye?

1240
01:22:34.574 --> 01:22:37.534
That stupid law. This isn't fair.

1241
01:22:38.328 --> 01:22:39.828
I love you.

1242
01:22:41.748 --> 01:22:44.959
Al, no problem.
You've still got one wish left.

1243
01:22:45.043 --> 01:22:47.086
Just say the word
and you're a prince again.

1244
01:22:47.212 --> 01:22:49.213
But, Genie, what about your freedom?

1245
01:22:49.381 --> 01:22:52.383
Hey, it's only an eternity of servitude.

1246
01:22:52.592 --> 01:22:54.510
This is love.

1247
01:22:54.594 --> 01:22:58.889
Al, you're not gonna find another girl
like her in a million years.

1248
01:22:59.057 --> 01:23:01.225
Believe me, I know. I've looked.

1249
01:23:02.602 --> 01:23:04.645
Jasmine, I do love you,

1250
01:23:04.729 --> 01:23:08.065
but I got to stop pretending
to be something I'm not.

1251
01:23:08.608 --> 01:23:10.359
I understand.

1252
01:23:13.154 --> 01:23:14.989
Genie, I wish for your freedom.

1253
01:23:15.073 --> 01:23:17.825
One bona fide
prince pedigree coming up.

1254
01:23:17.909 --> 01:23:21.078
-What?
-Genie, you're free.

1255
01:23:42.058 --> 01:23:44.727
I'm free. I'm free.

1256
01:23:44.811 --> 01:23:47.104
Quick. Quick.
Wish for something outrageous.

1257
01:23:47.188 --> 01:23:49.481
Say, "I want the Nile."
Wish for the Nile. Try that.

1258
01:23:50.442 --> 01:23:52.317
-I wish for the Nile.
-No way!

1259
01:23:54.029 --> 01:23:55.612
Does that feel good !

1260
01:23:56.614 --> 01:23:59.992
I'm free! I'm free at last!

1261
01:24:00.076 --> 01:24:03.287
I'm hittin' the road.
I'm off to see the world.

1262
01:24:11.796 --> 01:24:13.797
Genie, I'm. . .

1263
01:24:13.882 --> 01:24:16.383
I'm gonna miss you.

1264
01:24:16.468 --> 01:24:17.968
Me, too, Al.

1265
01:24:20.138 --> 01:24:22.139
No matter what anybody says,

1266
01:24:23.099 --> 01:24:25.684
you'll always be a prince to me.

1267
01:24:26.978 --> 01:24:28.020
That's right.

1268
01:24:28.104 --> 01:24:31.273
You've certainly proven your worth
as far as I'm concerned.

1269
01:24:32.275 --> 01:24:34.860
It's that law that's the problem.

1270
01:24:34.944 --> 01:24:38.113
-Father?
-Well, am I sultan or am I sultan?

1271
01:24:38.198 --> 01:24:39.823
From this day forth,

1272
01:24:39.908 --> 01:24:44.495
the princess shall marry
whomever she deems worthy.

1273
01:24:44.871 --> 01:24:47.331
Him. I choose. . .

1274
01:24:48.458 --> 01:24:51.168
I choose you, Aladdin.

1275
01:24:52.837 --> 01:24:54.713
Call me Al.

1276
01:24:56.549 --> 01:24:59.176
All of you, come over here.
Big group hug.

1277
01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:00.969
Group hug.

1278
01:25:01.054 --> 01:25:02.638
Mind if I kiss the monkey?

1279
01:25:03.389 --> 01:25:04.598
Hairball.

1280
01:25:04.682 --> 01:25:07.226
Well, I can't do any more damage
around this popsicle stand.

1281
01:25:07.310 --> 01:25:09.770
I'm outta here!

1282
01:25:09.854 --> 01:25:12.272
Bye-bye, you two crazy lovebirds!

1283
01:25:12.357 --> 01:25:15.025
Hey, Rugman, ciao. I'm history.

1284
01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:16.735
No, I'm mythology.

1285
01:25:16.820 --> 01:25:19.738
I don't care what I am. I'm free!

1286
01:25:22.867 --> 01:25:25.410
A whole new world

1287
01:25:25.495 --> 01:25:28.205
A whole new life

1288
01:25:28.289 --> 01:25:34.128
For you and me

1289
01:25:34.212 --> 01:25:37.881
A whole new world

1290
01:25:50.728 --> 01:25:52.771
Made you look.

1291
01:30:26.295 --> 01:30:28.630
You have been a fabulous audience.

1292
01:30:28.714 --> 01:30:30.882
Tell you what, you're
the best audience in the whole world.

1293
01:30:30.967 --> 01:30:33.593
Take care of yourselves.
Good night, Alice!

1294
01:30:33.678 --> 01:30:37.514
Good night, Agrabah! Adiós, amigos!

1295
01:30:37.538 --> 01:30:39.538
