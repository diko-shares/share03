00:33:45.058 --> 00:33:47.058
- [gasps]
- Sorry.
I think we should leave.

688
00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:48.661
These people are
really fucking freaking me out.

689
00:33:48.663 --> 00:33:49.695
They're really weird.

690
00:33:49.697 --> 00:33:52.430
- Hey, this is your weekend.

691
00:33:52.432 --> 00:33:54.800
Nothing's going to
happen to you while I'm here.

692
00:33:54.802 --> 00:33:57.437
These people are harmless.
They just want attention.

693
00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:01.206
- You promise?

694
00:34:01.208 --> 00:34:03.241
- Let's get you those sponsors.

695
00:34:03.243 --> 00:34:04.812
- Champagne?
- Jesus.

696
00:34:07.749 --> 00:34:09.149
- A toast.

697
00:34:09.951 --> 00:34:11.617
- Mmm.

698
00:34:11.619 --> 00:34:13.351
To new friends.

699
00:34:13.353 --> 00:34:16.056
- [chuckles]
- [chuckles] Oh, what?

700
00:34:22.362 --> 00:34:23.531
Mmm.

701
00:34:26.133 --> 00:34:28.135
The good stuff.
- Mm-hmm.

702
00:34:31.839 --> 00:34:34.509
- This is some of the
best Scotch money can buy.

703
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:37.208
- This shit?

704
00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:40.713
- They only sell this
to connoisseurs...

705
00:34:40.715 --> 00:34:42.584
and douchebags.

706
00:34:46.721 --> 00:34:49.187
So...

707
00:34:49.189 --> 00:34:50.792
which one are you?

708
00:34:52.026 --> 00:34:53.393
- RICHARD: Hmm.

709
00:34:53.761 --> 00:34:55.228
Hard to say.

710
00:34:56.096 --> 00:34:58.165
I just found this
in the cupboard.

711
00:35:03.905 --> 00:35:05.439
- LIZ: What a beautiful night.

712
00:35:07.341 --> 00:35:09.274
- You come out here a lot?

713
00:35:09.276 --> 00:35:11.010
- Every chance we get.

714
00:35:11.012 --> 00:35:12.847
We love the seclusion.

715
00:35:14.147 --> 00:35:17.583
- Even the Mormons
leave us alone.

716
00:35:17.585 --> 00:35:20.722
- It's too bad.
Those boys give great head.

717
00:35:22.657 --> 00:35:25.156
- So are you two swinger
or something?

718
00:35:25.158 --> 00:35:27.627
Because you should know,
we are not interested.

719
00:35:27.629 --> 00:35:28.493
- No, dear.

720
00:35:28.495 --> 00:35:30.261
We're just two
out-of-work actors

721
00:35:30.263 --> 00:35:33.899
not afraid to research a role,
to dig deep.

722
00:35:33.901 --> 00:35:35.266
- Film or television?

723
00:35:35.268 --> 00:35:38.037
- Oh, we prefer the "thea-tah."

724
00:35:38.039 --> 00:35:39.672
- We're actors.

725
00:35:39.674 --> 00:35:43.408
- Richard used to be a mime.
- Low blow.

726
00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:46.411
But I was the best mime
in the square.

727
00:35:46.413 --> 00:35:48.279
- So you don't like movies?

728
00:35:48.281 --> 00:35:51.282
- No, I like a good film.

729
00:35:51.284 --> 00:35:53.284
But when
the house lights come up,

730
00:35:53.286 --> 00:35:56.490
I'd like a fair shot
at banging the lead.

731
00:35:59.292 --> 00:36:00.995
- Is that how you two met?

732
00:36:01.596 --> 00:36:03.463
- That's how I meet
a lot of men.

733
00:36:05.198 --> 00:36:08.468
- Samantha,
what's your favorite movie?

734
00:36:09.771 --> 00:36:12.972
- I don't want to say.
- Oh, let me guess.

735
00:36:12.974 --> 00:36:14.974
"Breakfast at Tiffany's."

736
00:36:14.976 --> 00:36:17.109
- SAM: Nope.

737
00:36:17.111 --> 00:36:19.212
[mockingly]
- "An Affair to Remember."

738
00:36:20.213 --> 00:36:22.081
- RICHARD: I know.

739
00:36:22.083 --> 00:36:23.951
"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner."

740
00:36:26.253 --> 00:36:28.156
- What's that supposed to mean?

741
00:36:29.557 --> 00:36:31.557
- It was a joke.

742
00:36:31.559 --> 00:36:33.025
- A bad joke

743
00:36:33.027 --> 00:36:35.094
from 50 years ago.

744
00:36:35.096 --> 00:36:36.931
- Relax, bro.

745
00:36:38.498 --> 00:36:42.068
- Uh, it's "Jaws."
- Really?

746
00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:43.769
- Yeah. When I was little,

747
00:36:43.771 --> 00:36:45.738
it was the only
VHS tape my dad had

748
00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:47.940
and my brother and I
would watch it all the time.

749
00:36:47.942 --> 00:36:49.644
- Did you hear that, Richard?

750
00:36:50.912 --> 00:36:53.344
What's the matter with "Jaws"?

751
00:36:53.346 --> 00:36:56.115
- Hollywood used to
come to the theaters

752
00:36:56.117 --> 00:36:58.150
looking for talent,

753
00:36:58.152 --> 00:36:59.752
but after "Jaws".

754
00:36:59.754 --> 00:37:02.788
they just hire
a special effects guy

755
00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:08.928
to fist-fuck a puppet through
a rehashed morality tale.

756
00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:13.132
- [whispers] They say profanity
is a sign of intelligence.

757
00:37:13.134 --> 00:37:15.201
- [also whispers]
Do they say that?

758
00:37:15.203 --> 00:37:18.003
- Fuck superheroes,
fuck George Lucas

759
00:37:18.005 --> 00:37:19.841
and fuck "Jaws."

760
00:37:21.042 --> 00:37:22.340
- [sings Jaws theme] Doo doot.

761
00:37:22.342 --> 00:37:25.443
Doo doot. Doo doot.

- We're going to need
a bigger boat.

765

- The actual line is "You're
going to need a big boat."

766
00:37:33.654 --> 00:37:35.588
- RICHARD: I'm sorry,
you don't get it.

767
00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:37.322
Our memories
are flawed to protect us

768
00:37:37.324 --> 00:37:41.060
and to make
our lives seem meaningful.

769
00:37:41.062 --> 00:37:43.428
- More champagne?

770
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:46.297
- Dwayne doesn't like champagne.
- [chuckles]

771
00:37:46.299 --> 00:37:48.033
- That's right.

772
00:37:48.035 --> 00:37:49.637
I prefer scotch.

773
00:37:52.907 --> 00:37:54.940
A toast.

774
00:37:54.942 --> 00:37:56.307
- Do you know that Liz

775
00:37:56.309 --> 00:37:58.210
drank an entire
bottle of champagne

776
00:37:58.212 --> 00:37:59.881
on our wedding night?

777
00:38:01.348 --> 00:38:04.183
- What happened?
- I don't know if I should say.

778
00:38:04.185 --> 00:38:06.384
Have they legalized sodomy yet?

779
00:38:06.386 --> 00:38:09.121
- Richard! Jesus.
- [chuckles]

780
00:38:09.123 --> 00:38:11.690
- Dwayne was about to
make a toast.

781
00:38:11.692 --> 00:38:12.660
- A toast.

782
00:38:13.628 --> 00:38:16.162
To putting
all our cards on the table.

783
00:38:16.164 --> 00:38:17.897
- RICHARD: What does that mean?

784
00:38:17.899 --> 00:38:20.232
- I'd like to see
your email confirmation.

785
00:38:20.234 --> 00:38:22.668
- I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

786
00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:24.937
- Can't open the confirmation
without the Wi-Fi code.

787
00:38:24.939 --> 00:38:28.341
- Because you didn't
take a screenshot.
- Exactly.

788
00:38:32.513 --> 00:38:34.447
- It's getting
kind of cold out here.

789
00:38:36.984 --> 00:38:38.753
I think I'll go inside.

790
00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:44.290
- RICHARD: What did I say?

791
00:38:44.292 --> 00:38:46.192
Was it the sodomy thing?

this place was built?

798

- I would say the late '40s.

But why do you care about
a building's birthday?

800

I'm just making small talk.

a container, right?

803
00:39:39.747 --> 00:39:43.082

- Of course.

- That's-- That's a tough one.

806
00:39:47.922 --> 00:39:50.022
- Gun to your head.
Who's your favorite?

807
00:39:50.024 --> 00:39:51.557
- I'd say John.

808
00:39:51.559 --> 00:39:53.692

- Yeah.

809
00:39:53.694 --> 00:39:55.828

on what day were women
actually allowed to vote?

fight for anything, right?

1035
00:51:55.984 --> 00:51:57.883
- Don't stop on my account.

1036
00:51:57.885 --> 00:51:59.687
- You don't give me much choice.

1037
00:52:02.924 --> 00:52:04.391
- Where did Ricky go?

1038
00:52:04.959 --> 00:52:06.792
- You never know with him.

1039
00:52:06.794 --> 00:52:09.262
- Hmm.
- What about Liz?

1040
00:52:09.697 --> 00:52:11.329
- That's easy.

1041
00:52:11.331 --> 00:52:12.867
She's a creature of habit.

1042
00:52:15.268 --> 00:52:16.869
- I feel like you two
needed this weekend

1043
00:52:16.871 --> 00:52:18.372
to go a certain way.

1044
00:52:21.241 --> 00:52:22.644
- We're networking.

1045
00:52:23.845 --> 00:52:25.310
Trying to salvage her career.

1046
00:52:25.312 --> 00:52:27.247
- Ah, let me guess.

1047
00:52:28.181 --> 00:52:30.082
She's too old
to play the girlfriend

1048
00:52:30.084 --> 00:52:32.252
and too skinny to play the mom.

1049
00:52:33.821 --> 00:52:35.353
- Exactly.

1050
00:52:35.355 --> 00:52:37.890
- And, ironically,
as her body gets worse,

1051
00:52:37.892 --> 00:52:39.661
her acting improves.

1052
00:52:43.463 --> 00:52:46.766
You should tell her
to write her own scripts,

1053
00:52:46.768 --> 00:52:48.603
give herself the best parts.

1054
00:52:50.505 --> 00:52:53.105
She needs to take control.

1055
00:52:53.107 --> 00:52:54.441
- I'm sorry.

1056
00:53:02.382 --> 00:53:05.017
No. Hey. No. Look, listen.

1057
00:53:05.019 --> 00:53:06.854
That-- That's not happening.

1058
00:53:12.694 --> 00:53:14.527
- So, who won?

1059
00:53:14.529 --> 00:53:16.762
- Well, the bard was winning.

1060
00:53:16.764 --> 00:53:19.497
- But I unintentionally...
- Scratched on the eight ball.

1061
00:53:19.499 --> 00:53:21.834
- [chuckles] You're familiar
with my work.

1062
00:53:21.836 --> 00:53:23.137
[Liz chuckles]

1063
00:53:23.538 --> 00:53:25.571
Here you go. You forgot this.

1064
00:53:25.573 --> 00:53:27.608
- SAM: Babe, it's getting late.
What do you wanna do?

1065
00:53:30.611 --> 00:53:33.246
- I think Dwayne
is about to be very drunk.

1066
00:53:36.383 --> 00:53:37.985
- He's not wrong.

1067
00:53:40.588 --> 00:53:42.353
- What do you wanna do
about Ricky and Carrie?

1068
00:53:42.355 --> 00:53:44.156
- They're probably
sitting in another house

1069
00:53:44.158 --> 00:53:45.658
with another nice couple...

1070
00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:47.193
- Safe and sound.

1071
00:53:47.195 --> 00:53:48.996
- ...wondering where you're at.

1072
00:53:50.064 --> 00:53:51.733
- So, how long
you two been actors?

1073
00:53:54.301 --> 00:53:56.403
- Over 30 years.

1074
00:53:59.707 --> 00:54:02.242
- Dwayne started acting
after he blew out his knee.

1075
00:54:03.111 --> 00:54:04.912
- RICHARD: It was his shoulder.

1076
00:54:06.948 --> 00:54:08.816
- Same difference.

1077
00:54:09.851 --> 00:54:12.452
- He played Judas in
"The Passion Play."

1078
00:54:13.554 --> 00:54:16.088
- You didn't tell me
you played Judas Iscariot.

1079
00:54:16.090 --> 00:54:17.825
- He was very good.

1080
00:54:18.391 --> 00:54:19.825
- DWAYNE: Wasn't easy.

1081
00:54:19.827 --> 00:54:21.594
- How could it be?

1082
00:54:21.596 --> 00:54:24.063
He saw the miracles
and betrayed him anyway

1083
00:54:24.065 --> 00:54:27.298
for just 40 pieces of silver.

1084
00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:29.267
- That was 30.

1085
00:54:29.269 --> 00:54:32.470
- Well, most men
would need at least 40

1086
00:54:32.472 --> 00:54:34.509
just to consider it.

1087
00:54:35.576 --> 00:54:37.111
- Only 30.

1088
00:54:37.678 --> 00:54:39.647
- Would you have
done it for less?

1089
00:54:40.848 --> 00:54:42.380
- What do you mean?

1090
00:54:42.382 --> 00:54:43.749
- Dwayne knows what I mean.

1091
00:54:43.751 --> 00:54:44.986
He's done the work.

1092
00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:47.655
Would you have
done it for less?

1093
00:54:49.557 --> 00:54:51.690
- It wasn't about the money.

1094
00:54:51.692 --> 00:54:53.159
- That's right.

1095
00:54:53.161 --> 00:54:54.729
It's never about the money.

1096
00:54:55.997 --> 00:54:57.263
And Jesus
had to die that night

1097
00:54:57.265 --> 00:55:00.866
and someone had to betray him.

1098
00:55:00.868 --> 00:55:02.433
- And God chose me.

1099
00:55:02.435 --> 00:55:05.436
- That's right.
God made Judas do it.

1100
00:55:05.438 --> 00:55:08.406
- Exactly.
- God betrayed Judas.

1101
00:55:08.408 --> 00:55:09.742
- He chose me.

1102
00:55:09.744 --> 00:55:11.378
- He betrayed you.

1103
00:55:12.246 --> 00:55:15.514
- [laughs] That's right.

1104
00:55:15.516 --> 00:55:17.518
- [chuckles] Look at that, Liz.

1105
00:55:18.219 --> 00:55:20.353
He's got the goods.
- Mm-hmm.

1106
00:55:21.122 --> 00:55:24.190
- [laughs]
I don't have anything.

1107
00:55:24.192 --> 00:55:27.092
- Bullshit, man.
You're a listener.

1108
00:55:27.094 --> 00:55:29.261
And acting is listening.

1109
00:55:29.263 --> 00:55:31.230
- And reacting.

1110
00:55:31.232 --> 00:55:33.364
- Yes, of course
acting is reacting.

1111
00:55:33.366 --> 00:55:35.134
But you can't react
if you're not listening,

1112
00:55:35.136 --> 00:55:36.869
and Dwayne's a listener.

1113
00:55:36.871 --> 00:55:37.870
[Dwayne chuckles]

1114
00:55:37.872 --> 00:55:39.439
But more importantly...

1115
00:55:42.143 --> 00:55:43.878
...he's not drunk.

1116
00:55:47.882 --> 00:55:49.315
- Come on, babe. Let's--
- I wasn't sure

1117
00:55:49.317 --> 00:55:50.749
until I smelled the Ficus

1118
00:55:50.751 --> 00:55:53.821
he was watering with that
very expensive scotch.

1119
00:55:55.156 --> 00:55:57.857
It's an old salesman's trick.

1120
00:55:57.859 --> 00:56:00.962
See, the scotch is a prop,
mostly for me.

1121
00:56:01.963 --> 00:56:04.899
It loosens him up,
and it tells me I can...

1122
00:56:06.167 --> 00:56:08.200
...let down my guard.

1123
00:56:08.202 --> 00:56:09.737
- SAM: Okay, we're leaving.

1124
00:56:13.007 --> 00:56:14.575
- No.

1125
00:56:15.643 --> 00:56:18.577
Fuck this guy.
I ain't going anywhere.

1126
00:56:18.579 --> 00:56:20.913
- Then give me the keys.

1127
00:56:20.915 --> 00:56:22.550
Give me the fucking keys!

1128
00:56:24.484 --> 00:56:26.087
- You can't go yet.

1129
00:56:27.722 --> 00:56:30.658
[scoffs] You haven't revealed
your little secret.

1130
00:56:35.229 --> 00:56:36.829
- Secret.
What are you talking about?

1131
00:56:36.831 --> 00:56:39.934
- It's kind of obvious
if you're paying attention.

1132
00:56:42.904 --> 00:56:45.472
- What is, asshole?

1133
00:56:59.086 --> 00:57:00.554
- I was, um--

1134
00:57:01.522 --> 00:57:03.591
I was gonna tell you tonight.

1135
00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:11.498
- Sam has breast cancer.

1136
00:57:14.902 --> 00:57:16.671
- Oh, my God.
[discordant tone on piano plays]

1137
00:57:18.339 --> 00:57:21.175
- I probably
shouldn't have said that.

1138
00:57:28.049 --> 00:57:29.817
- What is she talking about?

1139
00:57:33.988 --> 00:57:35.756
- [whispering] I'm sorry.

1140
00:57:42.997 --> 00:57:44.229
[door closes]

1141
00:57:44.231 --> 00:57:46.901
- Why do you think she was
wearing that ridiculous scarf?

1142
00:58:03.617 --> 00:58:05.718
[suspenseful music playing]

1143
00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:07.286
- Yo, I thought
you were leaving.

1144
00:58:07.288 --> 00:58:08.689
- Not without you.

1145
00:58:10.725 --> 00:58:12.126
- What a gentleman.

1146
00:58:18.498 --> 00:58:19.631
- Did you have fun?

1147
00:58:19.633 --> 00:58:21.767
- Playing hard to get. You?

1148
00:58:21.769 --> 00:58:23.938
- Richard's not my time.
- Shut up. We're leaving.

1149
00:58:24.772 --> 00:58:26.171
Show me the confirmation.

1150
00:58:26.173 --> 00:58:27.473
- I'd rather not.

1151
00:58:27.475 --> 00:58:29.274
- Richard,
maybe we should leave.

1152
00:58:29.276 --> 00:58:31.443
- Richard, maybe you should
listen to your wife.

1153
00:58:31.445 --> 00:58:33.612
- She's just saying that
to seem polite.

1154
00:58:33.614 --> 00:58:35.447
She knows
we're not going anywhere.

1155
00:58:35.449 --> 00:58:36.615
- Guilty.

1156
00:58:36.617 --> 00:58:38.384
- Then show us the key.

1157
00:58:38.386 --> 00:58:41.153
- Try to see it
from our perspec--
- Where's the fucking key?

1158
00:58:41.155 --> 00:58:42.087
- [laughs]

1159
00:58:42.089 --> 00:58:44.590
Ah, the weed
must have worn off, huh, Cheech?

1160
00:58:44.592 --> 00:58:46.158
- Nah, man.
It's just kicking in.

1161
00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:47.459
Now, show me the goddamn key.

1162
00:58:47.461 --> 00:58:48.961
- Why should I?

1163
00:58:48.963 --> 00:58:51.030
- If you show it to us,
we'll leave.

1164
00:58:51.032 --> 00:58:52.097
- What if I don't
want you to leave?

1165
00:58:52.099 --> 00:58:54.400
I mean,
we haven't finished our game.

1166
00:58:54.402 --> 00:58:56.802
- Fuck you. We're out of here.

1167
00:58:56.804 --> 00:58:58.973
- I'll show you the key.
- You will?

1168
00:59:02.643 --> 00:59:04.545
- I don't have it.
Do you, Lizzie?

1169
00:59:05.012 --> 00:59:06.247
- Oh.

1170
00:59:06.881 --> 00:59:08.616
- Fuck this shit.
- RICHARD: Wait a minute.

1171
00:59:09.116 --> 00:59:11.183
I think I saw it earlier.

1172
00:59:11.185 --> 00:59:12.787
It's in the bedroom.

1173
00:59:13.821 --> 00:59:15.122
- It is?

1174
00:59:20.227 --> 00:59:21.896
[light knocking]

1175
00:59:22.463 --> 00:59:23.898
Sam?

1176
00:59:27.268 --> 00:59:29.036
- I'll be out in a minute.

1177
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:30.971
- Please don't be upset with me.

1178
00:59:32.073 --> 00:59:33.674
- <i>Please go away.</i>

1179
00:59:35.476 --> 00:59:37.178
- It just slipped out.

1180
00:59:39.647 --> 00:59:41.182
- Leave me alone.

1181
00:59:44.285 --> 00:59:45.820
- RICHARD: You didn't know, huh?

1182
00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:48.222
- Sam does not have cancer.

1183
00:59:49.156 --> 00:59:50.825
- I'd be in denial, too.

1184
00:59:51.859 --> 00:59:54.061
I bet she's got great tits.

1185

[knife clicks]

1186
01:00:05.507 --> 01:00:07.272

We don't have to do this.

[Richard laughing]

1188
01:00:18.786 --> 01:00:20.988
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

1189
01:00:22.189 --> 01:00:23.958
What do you want from us?

1190
01:00:27.795 --> 01:00:29.228
- I'd like to
fuck your girlfriend

1191
01:00:29.230 --> 01:00:31.699
while my wife eats my ass.

1192
01:00:32.567 --> 01:00:34.168
How about you?

[wheezing]

1195
01:01:04.999 --> 01:01:06.867
- You weren't supposed
to come in here.

1196
01:01:11.172 --> 01:01:13.540
I fixed the shower curtain
with some packing tape

1197
01:01:13.542 --> 01:01:15.474
I found in
a drawer in the kitchen.

1198
01:01:15.476 --> 01:01:16.944
- Oh, my God.

1199
01:01:17.912 --> 01:01:20.679
- I think I did
a pretty good job,

1200
01:01:20.681 --> 01:01:22.883
but there is still quite a mess.

1201
01:01:25.286 --> 01:01:29.188
I tried to stop the bleeding,
but I ran out of tape,

1202
01:01:29.190 --> 01:01:31.959
and the cuts
were just way too deep.

1203
01:01:33.394 --> 01:01:34.627
Which is really for the best

1204
01:01:34.629 --> 01:01:37.998
because I don't
need the competition.

1205
01:01:39.166 --> 01:01:41.435
- Dwayne!
- I don't think Dwayne
can hear you, dear.
