(CHUCKLING) Now, that...
That is my father.

177
00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.560
He has a nice face.

178
00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:20.560
He looks a lot like you.

179
00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:22.720
No.

180
00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:26.560
No, I'm not very much
like him at all, really.

181
00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:29.040
My father's fighting in the war.

182
00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.000
My father went away to war too.

183
00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:38.440
But that was a long, long time ago.

-Before this dreadful winter.
-Winter's not all bad.

185
00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:47.040
There's ice skating and snowball fights.

186
00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.760
-And Christmas!
-Not here.

187
00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:56.240
No. No, we haven't had a Christmas
in a hundred years.

188
00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:00.600
What?
No presents for a hundred years?

189

Always winter, never Christmas.

190
00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.360
It's been a long winter.

loved Narnia in summer.

like to hear some now?

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.720
Yes, please.

197
00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:39.000
Now, are you familiar

198
00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:42.720
-with any Narnian lullabies?
-Sorry, no.

199

Well, that's good.

-But I haven't!

353
00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:12.800
I saw Mr. Tumnus again!
And this time Edmund went too.

354
00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:18.600
You... You saw the faun?

355
00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:25.440
Well, he didn't actually
go there with me.

I'm sorry, Peter.

360
00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:44.000
I shouldn't have encouraged her,

361
00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:47.160
but you know what little children
are like these days.

362

you were not to be disturbed.

368

It's all right, Mrs. Macready.
I'm sure there's an explanation.

369
00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:27.520
But first of all, I think this one
is in need of a little hot chocolate.

We're very sorry, sir.
It won't happen again.

It's our sister, sir. Lucy.

-The weeping girl.
-Yes, sir.

376
00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:54.000
-She's upset.
-Hence the weeping.

-We can handle it.
-Oh, I can see that.

The wardrobe, upstairs.

383
00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:16.880
Lucy thinks she's found a forest inside.

384

She won't stop going on about it.

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:23.440
-What was it like?
-Like talking to a lunatic.

No, no, no, not her. The forest.

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:29.400
-You're not saying you believe her?
-You don't?

in schools these days?

they were only pretending.

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:40.760
He's usually the more
truthful one, is he?

393

No. This would be the first time.

Well, if she's not mad
and she's not lying,

395

then logically we must
assume she's telling the truth.

396
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.200
You're saying that we
should just believe her?

She's your sister, isn't she?
You're her family.

Oh, yeah,
there's a right bit more than hope!

525
00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:03.920
Aslan is on the move.

526
00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:12.880
Who's Aslan?

527
00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:15.120
(LAUGHING) Who's Aslan?

528
00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:18.080
You cheeky little blighter.

529
00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:21.680
What?

530
00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:27.640
-You don't know, do you?
-We haven't exactly been here very long.

531
00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:30.480
Well, he's only the king
of the whole wood.

532
00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:34.240
The top geezer.
The real King of Narnia.

533
00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:37.960
-He's been away for a long while.
-But he's just got back!

534
00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:40.320
And he's waiting for you
near the Stone Table!

535
00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:43.760
-He's waiting for us?
-You're blooming joking!

536
00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:46.440
They don't even know
about the prophecy!

537
00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:49.320
-Well, then...
-Look.

538
00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:52.680
Aslan's return,

539
00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:56.080
Tumnus' arrest, the secret police,

540
00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:58.200
it's all happening because of you!

541
00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:01.680
-You're blaming us?
-No! Not blaming.

542
00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:05.000
-Thanking you.
-There's a prophecy.

543
00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:08.600
"When Adam's flesh and Adam's bone

544
00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:11.760
sits at Cair Paravel in throne,

545
00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:14.280
the evil time will be over and done."

546
00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:16.880
-That doesn't really rhyme.
-I know it don't.

547
00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:19.400
You're kind of missing the point!

548
00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:21.760
It has long been foretold

549
00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:24.880
that two Sons of Adam
and two Daughters of Eve

550
00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:29.520
will defeat the White Witch
and restore peace to Narnia.

551
00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:33.800
And you think we're the ones?

552
00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:36.720
You'd better be, 'cause Aslan's
already fitted out your army.

553
00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:39.320
-Our army?
-Mum sent us away

554
00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:42.160
so we wouldn't get caught up in a war.

555
00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:45.440
I think you've made a mistake.

556
00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:48.480
-We're not heroes.
-We're from Finchley.

557
00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:53.040
Thank you for your hospitality.

558
00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:58.360
-But we really have to go.
-No, you can't just leave!

559
00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:02.080
He's right.
We have to help Mr. Tumnus.

560
00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:04.080
It's out of our hands.

561
00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:06.200
I'm sorry,

562
00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:09.720
but it's time the four of us
were getting home. Ed?

563
00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:13.200
Ed?

564
00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:19.120
-I'm gonna kill him.
-MR BEAVER: You may not have to.

565
00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:21.920
Has Edmund ever been
to Narnia before?

566
00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:50.240
Hurry!

567
00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:13.280
-Edmund!
-They'll hear you!

568
00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:15.760
No!

569
00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:18.240
-Get off me!
-You're playing into her hands.

570

-We can't just let him go!
-He's our brother!

571
00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:22.000
MR BEAVER: He's the bait!

572
00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:24.320
-The Witch wants all four of you!
-PETER: Why?

573
00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:27.640
To stop the prophecy from coming true.

574
00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:29.360
To kill you!

575
00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:42.200
-This is all your fault.
-My fault?

576
00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:45.400
None of this would have happened
if you had listened to me in the first place!

577
00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:48.240
-You knew this would happen.
-I didn't know.

578
00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:50.400
Which is why we should
have left while we could!

579
00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:51.840
Stop it!

580
00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:56.040
-This isn't going to help Edmund.
-She's right.

581
00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:59.840
Only Aslan can help your brother now.

582
00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:03.680
Then take us to him.

-I'm Edmund!

00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:22.120

She told me to come back here!

I'm a Son of Adam!

My apologies,
fortunate favourite of the queen.

589
00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:31.840
Or else, not so fortunate.

590
00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:38.520
Right this way.

591
00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:01.120
Wait here.

(STAMMERING) Yes, Your Majesty.

I thought you might.

595
00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:55.320
Tell me, Edmund,

596
00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.200
are your sisters deaf?

597
00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:01.720
No.

598
00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:04.040
And your brother, is he

599
00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:08.520
unintelligent?

600
00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:11.040
Well, I think so. But Mum says...

601
00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:15.080
Then how dare you come alone!

602
00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:17.840
-I tried!
-Edmund, I asked so little of you.

603
00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:20.800
-They just don't listen to me!
-You couldn't even do that.

604

I did bring them halfway.

605

Well.

I suppose you're not
a total loss then, are you?

608
00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:42.960
Well, I was wondering,

609
00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:48.640
could I maybe have some more
Turkish delight now?

gets pretty cranky when he's hungry.

said something about Aslan!

703
01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:16.320
Aslan?

704
01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:18.840
Where?

-He's a stranger here, Your Majesty.

you could do with these.

No.

What's this?

1258
02:10:07.080 --> 02:10:08.880
It seems familiar.

1259
02:10:11.920 --> 02:10:13.760
As if from a dream.

1260
02:10:13.920 --> 02:10:15.800
Or a dream of a dream.

-Susan, you're on my foot!

Peter, move off!

What were you all
doing in the wardrobe?

1272

You wouldn't believe us
if we told you, sir.

Will we ever go back?

Oh, I expect so.

1279
02:12:52.880 --> 02:12:56.560
But it'll probably happen
when you're not looking for it.

1280
