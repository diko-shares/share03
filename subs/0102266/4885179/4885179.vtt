1
00:03:04.183 --> 00:03:06.769
Green 88! Green 88!

2
00:03:06.937 --> 00:03:08.687
Set! Hut!

3
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.325
Ladies and gentlemen,
that ends the first half of play...

4
00:03:22.493 --> 00:03:26.955
with the score
Cleveland, 17, Los Angeles, 10.

5
00:03:28.417 --> 00:03:29.792
Let's go. Move, move!

6
00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.008
Billy Cole.

7
00:03:37.175 --> 00:03:39.718
- Billy Cole.
- Your first half stunk!

8
00:03:39.887 --> 00:03:43.514
Open the holes up.
Get in there like hogs, like pigs!

9
00:03:43.682 --> 00:03:47.643
- Billy Cole, you got a call on Line 3.
- Come on, go out there in this half...

10
00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:50.937
and kick some butt!
Let's get out of this town as a winner.

11
00:03:51.147 --> 00:03:52.355
I hate Cleveland.

12
00:03:56.986 --> 00:04:00.406
- Hello.
- Hello, William. This is Milo.

13
00:04:00.574 --> 00:04:02.699
There's a lot of money
riding on this game.

14
00:04:05.996 --> 00:04:08.455
You better start scoring
some touchdowns, William.

15
00:04:08.623 --> 00:04:11.626
Just do whatever it takes. Understood?

16
00:04:11.793 --> 00:04:13.002
Or else you're history.

17
00:04:17.173 --> 00:04:19.966
Welcome back
to the second half. We're in Cleveland...

18
00:04:20.218 --> 00:04:24.180
site of tonight's confrontation between
the L.A. Stallions and the Cleveland Cats.

19
00:04:24.348 --> 00:04:26.848
I'm Vern Lundquist,
along with Dick Butkus.

20
00:04:27.016 --> 00:04:30.478
And yes, friends, it really is that wet.

21
00:04:31.021 --> 00:04:34.189
Well, Vern, even though
the Stallions trail 17 to 10...

22
00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:35.983
there walks a happy man:

23
00:04:36.151 --> 00:04:38.694
Sheldon Marcone,
owner of the L.A. Stallions.

24
00:04:38.862 --> 00:04:41.697
His team sits atop the Western Division
at 6 and 2.

25
00:04:41.865 --> 00:04:45.033
Sheldon is standing by with Lynn Swann.
Let's go down to them.

26
00:04:45.201 --> 00:04:47.370
Forty-nine thousand,
two hundred and fifty-six.

27
00:04:47.536 --> 00:04:51.040
That's pretty poor attendance even
for a night like this, wouldn't you say?

28
00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:52.540
I wouldn't say, Lynn.

29
00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:56.045
Perhaps then you can explain the drop-off
in attendance and TV ratings.

30
00:04:56.213 --> 00:04:58.213
Is this the death of professional football?

31
00:04:58.382 --> 00:05:01.384
No, I think that we're witnessing
the death of good journalism.

32
00:05:21.196 --> 00:05:23.738
Mr. Marcone, are there any heroes
left in this game?

33
00:05:24.156 --> 00:05:27.701
What game are you watching?
Let's talk about heroes.

34
00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:31.956
Billy Cole is having the game of his life
out there tonight.

35
00:05:39.423 --> 00:05:42.966
Set! Set!

36
00:05:43.884 --> 00:05:45.427
Hut! Hut!

37
00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.733
First and 10 at the Cleveland 47-yard line.

38
00:06:04.072 --> 00:06:07.742
- Way to go.
- Good job. Good job.

39
00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:11.327
First and 10,
less than two minutes remaining.

40
00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.290
This is probably L.A.'s final possession.

41
00:06:14.458 --> 00:06:16.959
The Stallions need 7.
A field goal will not do.

42
00:06:17.293 --> 00:06:21.797
And Dick, you've got to be thinking,
"Get the ball to Billy Cole."

43
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.769
Hut! Hut!

44
00:06:44.028 --> 00:06:46.988
The pass is complete to Billy Cole.

45
00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:50.201
Go, go, go!

46
00:07:21.817 --> 00:07:23.192
Ain't life a bitch?

47
00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:55.557
- Dude's trashed.
- Shit, man.

48
00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:57.393
We should do something to him.

49
00:08:09.613 --> 00:08:10.738
Do it.

50
00:08:28.257 --> 00:08:32.802
Goddamn. This dude is really trashed.

51
00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:37.099
Go on. Take his watch.

52
00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:43.438
He's got a gun!

53
00:08:48.278 --> 00:08:49.736
Ugh.

54
00:09:15.096 --> 00:09:17.222
This is Hallenbeck Investigations.

55
00:09:17.389 --> 00:09:18.849
Leave your message at the beep.

56
00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:24.480
Yo. Mike Matthews. I got a job for you.

57
00:09:24.648 --> 00:09:26.649
Hold on. Hold on a minute.

58
00:09:26.816 --> 00:09:27.816
- Mike.
- Joe.

59
00:09:27.984 --> 00:09:31.403
I thought you were still in Las Vegas. I was
gonna leave a message on your machine.

60
00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.447
You sound terrific.
What'd you do last night?

61
00:09:34.615 --> 00:09:37.283
Think I fucked a squirrel to death
and I don't even remember.

62
00:09:37.451 --> 00:09:39.995
Listen, Joe. You still taking charity?

63
00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:43.790
- What do you got?
- Stripper. Excuse me, exotic dancer.

64
00:09:43.959 --> 00:09:46.835
She's got some weirdo hassling her
and I'm booked solid.

65
00:09:47.003 --> 00:09:49.963
She's hot, Joe.
She rates a three on my finger scale.

66
00:09:50.631 --> 00:09:54.509
That means I'd cut off three of my fingers
if God would let me fuck her. Ha-ha.

67
00:09:54.677 --> 00:09:58.138
Make her a one on your nose scale.
Improve your looks.

68
00:09:58.306 --> 00:10:01.892
Yeah, yeah. Eat me.
So, listen, I'm booked. You got plans?

69
00:10:02.226 --> 00:10:04.269
I'm thinking about
smoking some cigarettes.

70
00:10:04.687 --> 00:10:06.897
Could you postpone?

71
00:10:07.065 --> 00:10:09.899
- These are pretty good cigarettes.
- It's 500 bucks, Joe.

72
00:10:11.278 --> 00:10:15.280
I gotta run some errands.
Meet you at your office in an hour.

73
00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:17.615
Terrific. Comb your hair.
I'll lend you a nice jacket...

74
00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:41.682
Nobody likes you.

75
00:10:42.017 --> 00:10:43.808
Everybody hates you.

76
00:10:44.936 --> 00:10:47.020
You're gonna lose.

77
00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:52.109
Smile, you fuck.

78
00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:17.176
Goddamn.

79
00:11:26.936 --> 00:11:28.687
- Jimmy?
- Yeah.

80
00:11:28.855 --> 00:11:30.773
You're still here?

81
00:11:31.106 --> 00:11:32.691
I guess I am.

82
00:11:36.946 --> 00:11:38.697
Help me!

83
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:46.205
Yo, Ray. What's with the girl, man?

84
00:11:46.373 --> 00:11:47.789
- Bitch won't blow me.
- Help me.

85
00:11:48.165 --> 00:11:50.793
It's too early in the morning for that shit.
Let her go.

86
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.087
She ain't coming up
till she starts blowing.

87
00:11:54.755 --> 00:11:56.423
Ray, she's gonna drown, man.

88
00:11:56.799 --> 00:11:59.426
- Hey, fuck you, you loser!
- Let her go, Ray.

89
00:11:59.594 --> 00:12:03.931
What are you doing here? This is a league
party. You got kicked out, remember? Huh?

90
00:12:04.099 --> 00:12:05.474
Remember?

91
00:12:08.852 --> 00:12:10.895
You bastard!

92
00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.148
- Come on, get out of here.
- Pig!

93
00:12:13.316 --> 00:12:15.734
You fuckhead!

94
00:12:17.153 --> 00:12:19.028
- Aah.
- Best arm in the National League.

95
00:12:19.197 --> 00:12:22.615
Remember that, you fat son of a bitch.

96
00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:29.831
Hey, Joe.

97
00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:38.841
Thought you were in Las Vegas.

98
00:12:39.008 --> 00:12:40.759
I was.

99
00:12:42.136 --> 00:12:45.346
- Where'd you sleep?
- The office.

100
00:12:48.851 --> 00:12:51.186
Hey, Furry Tom.

101
00:12:53.355 --> 00:12:54.565
How much did you lose?

102
00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:57.900
- I wasn't there to gamble.
- How much?

103
00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:00.320
I was doing a skip trace.

104
00:13:05.326 --> 00:13:06.368
Fifty bucks.

105
00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:12.081
What is this?

106
00:13:12.875 --> 00:13:15.501
Darian's class drew holiday pictures.
That was hers.

107
00:13:15.669 --> 00:13:18.880
Obviously, her teacher wants to see us.

108
00:13:19.173 --> 00:13:22.384
- Where is she?
- She's up at a friend's.

109
00:13:24.303 --> 00:13:27.014
Boys still giving her a hard time
about the braces?

110
00:13:27.182 --> 00:13:28.347
Are you kidding?

111
00:13:28.515 --> 00:13:31.393
"Metal mouth," that's the latest.
Little bastards.

112
00:13:33.187 --> 00:13:35.730
She'll be screwing them
by the time she's 14.

113
00:13:35.899 --> 00:13:37.816
- Watch your goddamn mouth.
- Christ, Sarah.

114
00:13:37.984 --> 00:13:40.402
You let her wear enough makeup.
She looks like...

115
00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.528
a goddamn raccoon.

116
00:13:42.697 --> 00:13:45.908
I come in the house, I think it's a burglar.
I almost shot her twice.

117
00:13:47.826 --> 00:13:50.245
You're not funny.
And all the girls wear makeup.

118
00:13:50.413 --> 00:13:54.374
I'm sure all the girls at that school
don't put it on with a paint sprayer.

119
00:13:54.542 --> 00:13:56.751
For your information...

120
00:13:57.086 --> 00:14:00.589
a lot of people think I'm very funny.
- Yeah? Well, go live with them.

121
00:14:00.756 --> 00:14:02.633
Don't tempt me.

122
00:14:24.822 --> 00:14:26.948
Who's the guy in the closet?

123
00:14:28.116 --> 00:14:29.116
Excuse me?

124
00:14:29.661 --> 00:14:32.788
That's right.
Sometimes you forget I'm a detective.

125
00:14:34.249 --> 00:14:37.292
All this steam in the shower,
like somebody was just in there.

126
00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:41.587
Only your hair is dry. So it must be
somebody else we're talking about.

127
00:14:41.755 --> 00:14:43.966
A male somebody
because the toilet seat's up.

128
00:14:44.716 --> 00:14:47.177
Not under the bed,
must've stuck him in the closet...

129
00:14:47.345 --> 00:14:50.471
when you heard my key hit the lock
a day early.

130
00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.600
So who's the guy in the closet?

131
00:14:55.061 --> 00:14:58.187
Jesus Christ, nothing changes.

132
00:14:59.566 --> 00:15:00.982
You're still a lunatic.

133
00:15:01.942 --> 00:15:03.235
Gonna tell me who it is?

134
00:15:05.654 --> 00:15:07.197
You want me to open the closet?

135
00:15:07.365 --> 00:15:10.741
I'll do it, okay? And then we'll both know
that you're a fucking psycho!

136
00:15:10.909 --> 00:15:13.703
- Is that what you want, huh?
- No.

137
00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:15.371
Thank you.

138
00:15:16.039 --> 00:15:17.456
That door stays shut.

139
00:15:19.376 --> 00:15:23.004
What I'm gonna do is count to three.

140
00:15:23.798 --> 00:15:26.341
- Then I'm gonna put a bullet in that door.
- Oh, Jesus.

141
00:15:27.384 --> 00:15:30.011
You can stop me any time
by telling the truth.

142
00:15:31.514 --> 00:15:33.639
- One.
- Call your shrink, Joe.

143
00:15:33.807 --> 00:15:38.312
- Call and tell him you're fucking losing it!
- The truth is a beautiful thing.

144
00:15:38.687 --> 00:15:41.565
- Two.
- How dare you come into this house and...

145
00:15:41.732 --> 00:15:43.232
- Three.
- No!

146
00:15:50.575 --> 00:15:52.701
- Look, Joe...
- Keeping her warm for me, Mike?

147
00:15:52.909 --> 00:15:55.037
Easy. Don't do nothing dumb.

148
00:15:55.538 --> 00:15:57.205
How was she?

149
00:15:58.206 --> 00:16:00.167
On your finger scale, how was my wife?

150
00:16:03.211 --> 00:16:07.215
- It just happened, Joe. It...
- Sure, sure, I know.

151
00:16:07.424 --> 00:16:09.467
It just happened.

152
00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:12.346
It could happen to anybody.

153
00:16:12.596 --> 00:16:15.640
It was an accident, right? You tripped...

154
00:16:15.807 --> 00:16:19.686
slipped on the floor and accidentally
stuck your dick in my wife.

155
00:16:20.145 --> 00:16:24.024
"Oops. I'm so sorry, Mrs. H.
I guess this just isn't my week."

156
00:16:28.321 --> 00:16:32.407
- Joe, put the gun down, please.
- Oh, yeah, the gun.

157
00:16:34.951 --> 00:16:37.037
You know, Sarah, I think you're right.

158
00:16:40.124 --> 00:16:41.750
I think I am losing it.

159
00:16:48.548 --> 00:16:50.591
Get out of here.

160
00:16:52.552 --> 00:16:54.513
Head or gut, Mike?

161
00:16:54.681 --> 00:16:56.722
Joe, how long we been friends?

162
00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:59.768
I'd say roughly till
you started banging my wife.

163
00:17:00.144 --> 00:17:01.269
Head or gut?

164
00:17:04.481 --> 00:17:05.565
Gut.

165
00:17:09.903 --> 00:17:11.946
- You got that address for me?
- Huh?

166
00:17:12.115 --> 00:17:13.615
The surveillance job.

167
00:17:14.366 --> 00:17:16.742
You still want the job?

168
00:17:17.412 --> 00:17:20.329
Five hundred bucks is 500 bucks, Mike.

169
00:17:22.916 --> 00:17:25.626
Yeah. I guess you're right.

170
00:17:27.963 --> 00:17:30.006
Cory, huh? Throw a shot into her too?

171
00:17:45.647 --> 00:17:49.651
Get the fuck out of here.
Go shit in your own yard.

172
00:18:12.258 --> 00:18:14.092
Joe!

173
00:18:19.347 --> 00:18:21.098
Over here.

174
00:18:28.775 --> 00:18:30.525
Somebody wired the car.

175
00:18:51.798 --> 00:18:54.257
Who the fuck did this, Joe?

176
00:18:54.424 --> 00:18:56.550
Mr. Rogers.

177
00:18:56.885 --> 00:18:59.261
How the hell should I know?

178
00:18:59.888 --> 00:19:01.138
You told the cops...

179
00:19:01.307 --> 00:19:04.976
I told them Mike came by to farm out
a surveillance job this morning.

180
00:19:05.144 --> 00:19:06.728
That's all?

181
00:19:06.895 --> 00:19:09.021
You didn't mention...

182
00:19:09.898 --> 00:19:12.107
No. I didn't mention it.

183
00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.239
You knew, didn't you?

184
00:19:18.907 --> 00:19:20.407
- I suspected.
- Goddamn it.

185
00:19:20.576 --> 00:19:21.910
Why didn't you say something?

186
00:19:23.287 --> 00:19:27.457
What do you want me to say, Sarah?
"Fuck you, Sarah"?

187
00:19:27.708 --> 00:19:30.544
Yes. Yeah. Or anything
to get a rise out of you.

188
00:19:30.711 --> 00:19:32.378
How about, "You're a lying bitch"?

189
00:19:32.547 --> 00:19:35.423
How about, "If there weren't cops here,
I'd spit in your face"?

190
00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:38.884
- You want me to spit on you?
- It would show you had some pride left.

191
00:19:39.052 --> 00:19:40.595
Fresh out, honey.

192
00:19:40.762 --> 00:19:44.682
You know what? Fuck you, Joe.
You were never around. I was lonely!

193
00:19:44.851 --> 00:19:46.768
Buy a dog.

194
00:19:47.728 --> 00:19:51.397
I'm not the one who hates you, Joe.
You're the one who hates you.

195
00:19:51.566 --> 00:19:54.526
And I get to live with myself
24 hours a day.

196
00:19:56.945 --> 00:19:58.445
Gett off

197
00:19:58.614 --> 00:20:00.990
23 positions in a one night stand

198
00:20:01.616 --> 00:20:02.992
Gett off

199
00:20:03.286 --> 00:20:05.119
Alex, the astronaut.

200
00:20:05.453 --> 00:20:07.622
Alex, the astronaut.

201
00:20:07.789 --> 00:20:12.210
Hey, last time I saw you drink straight vodka
was because you just cheated on Cory.

202
00:20:12.377 --> 00:20:17.715
- Yeah, well, why don't you pour me another?
- Oh, man. You didn't.

203
00:20:17.884 --> 00:20:20.634
You gotta be crazy, partner,
cheating on her.

204
00:20:20.803 --> 00:20:22.636
I gotta be something, Harp.

205
00:20:22.805 --> 00:20:27.642
Because nowadays all I do is lose friends,
drink and nail anything with a heartbeat.

206
00:20:27.809 --> 00:20:30.644
Yeah, well,
just stay on that side of the bar, huh?

207
00:20:31.689 --> 00:20:32.980
Oh, Harp.

208
00:20:33.148 --> 00:20:34.231
Gett off

209
00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.482
Let a woman be a woman

210
00:20:35.651 --> 00:20:37.443
And a man be a man

211
00:20:37.612 --> 00:20:38.987
Gett off

212
00:20:45.452 --> 00:20:49.163
- Should I pay you now?
- No, you should not. Put the money away.

213
00:20:49.332 --> 00:20:50.539
Put it away. Sit down.

214
00:20:59.799 --> 00:21:01.675
So you don't think the cops
can help you?

215
00:21:01.844 --> 00:21:04.846
Sure. After I'm dead,
they'll perform the autopsy.

216
00:21:05.431 --> 00:21:08.933
- I guess you don't wanna wait that long.
- Guess not.

217
00:21:12.355 --> 00:21:14.396
This the only kind of music
they play in this joint?

218
00:21:14.565 --> 00:21:17.358
- Mm-hm.
- I hate this funk shit.

219
00:21:17.734 --> 00:21:20.528
- I may have to charge you extra.
- What'd you expect?

220
00:21:21.821 --> 00:21:24.531
The Four Freshmen. Pat Boone.

221
00:21:24.741 --> 00:21:27.743
- What are you, my father?
- Yeah, I'm your father.

222
00:21:27.912 --> 00:21:30.747
- Go put some clothes on.
- You're hilarious.

223
00:21:32.833 --> 00:21:34.334
Stick your head in that speaker.

224
00:21:34.501 --> 00:21:38.380
You'll be screaming,
"Play that funky music, white boy."

225
00:21:39.589 --> 00:21:41.090
The screaming part, I believe.

226
00:21:43.551 --> 00:21:45.595
Hello, handsome.

227
00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:51.393
So who's that stiff over there?

228
00:21:52.894 --> 00:21:55.689
- That's nobody.
- Mm-hm.

229
00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:00.067
It's my turn to dance. Shit.

230
00:22:08.076 --> 00:22:11.413
All right, all right. Let's bring out a woman
who's always in the mood.

231
00:22:11.579 --> 00:22:16.584
Put your hands together for
the lovely and talented Miss Cory!

232
00:22:30.391 --> 00:22:32.933
Riding on the range

233
00:22:33.102 --> 00:22:36.270
I've got my hat
On

234
00:22:36.439 --> 00:22:41.401
I've got my boots
Dusty

235
00:22:42.903 --> 00:22:43.944
I've got my saddle

236
00:22:44.113 --> 00:22:46.155
Hi. You're nobody.

237
00:22:46.449 --> 00:22:50.617
- Shh. Don't tell anyone.
- That's what Cory says, you're nobody.

238
00:22:50.952 --> 00:22:54.955
Take it easy, junior. Nobody's raining on
your parade. I'm just keeping an eye on her.

239
00:22:55.124 --> 00:22:57.959
What are you, some kind of bodyguard
or something?

240
00:22:58.126 --> 00:22:59.544
Yeah, something like that.

241
00:22:59.961 --> 00:23:02.797
- You got a match on you?
- No.

242
00:23:02.964 --> 00:23:06.134
- Is Cory in some kind of trouble?
- I don't know. You tell me.

243
00:23:06.469 --> 00:23:08.094
She didn't mention anything to me.

244
00:23:08.929 --> 00:23:11.221
What, does that piss you off?

245
00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:14.976
- Maybe.
- Don't sweat it.

246
00:23:15.144 --> 00:23:16.310
Women have secrets.

247
00:23:20.066 --> 00:23:22.901
Water's wet, the sky is blue,
women have secrets.

248
00:23:23.068 --> 00:23:24.109
Who gives a fuck?

249
00:23:26.489 --> 00:23:28.155
You want a beer?

250
00:23:29.157 --> 00:23:33.577
So she just hired you, huh?
What, you're in the book or something?

251
00:23:34.163 --> 00:23:36.330
She hired my buddy Mike.
I'm just filling in.

252
00:23:36.664 --> 00:23:39.000
- And where's this Mike?
- He died.

253
00:23:39.542 --> 00:23:40.876
I'm sorry to hear that.

254
00:23:42.587 --> 00:23:44.588
- He was an asshole.
- Hey, look, man...

255
00:23:44.757 --> 00:23:48.425
I don't know who the fuck you are
or what's going on, but Cory's my girl.

256
00:23:48.594 --> 00:23:51.805
If she's in some kind of trouble,
I wanna know about it.

257
00:23:51.971 --> 00:23:55.642
- Confidential, big boy.
- Well, why don't you just tell me anyway?

258
00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:58.353
Nope.

259
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:03.607
Man, you couldn't protect
a cup of warm piss.

260
00:24:07.278 --> 00:24:09.571
Why don't you just
go ahead and hit me?

261
00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:10.865
Excuse me?

262
00:24:11.032 --> 00:24:14.035
Come on, chickenshit.
Bust me in the chops.

263
00:24:14.202 --> 00:24:17.329
You don't think an old guy like me
could hurt you, do you, Jimmy?

264
00:24:18.082 --> 00:24:19.457
Oh, so you know who I am?

265
00:24:19.625 --> 00:24:23.795
James Alexander Dix, quarterback
for the L.A. Stallions, '89, '90.

266
00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:27.214
Banned from the league
on gambling charges.

267
00:24:27.383 --> 00:24:29.800
Allegations of drug abuse.

268
00:24:29.969 --> 00:24:32.720
Another tragic tale of wasted youth.

269
00:24:32.887 --> 00:24:35.722
- Now you're starting to piss me off.
- It's about fucking time.

270
00:24:36.057 --> 00:24:38.058
Joe Hallenbeck.

271
00:24:40.145 --> 00:24:42.896
- I'm a private detective.
- You're a fucking lowlife to me.

272
00:24:43.065 --> 00:24:45.858
At least I didn't shit
my talent away on coke.

273
00:24:59.999 --> 00:25:01.583
I spilled my warm cup of piss.

274
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.211
- Cory, get your shit, let's go. Come on.
- What's the matter with you?

275
00:25:05.378 --> 00:25:08.047
- Jimmy, man!
- Shut up! Keep your monkey ass in the cage.

276
00:25:08.214 --> 00:25:11.092
It's cool. It's cool.

277
00:25:11.259 --> 00:25:13.678
Uh... Let's hear it for Miss Cory.

278
00:25:15.055 --> 00:25:16.096
Yeah. Let's hear it.

279
00:26:12.112 --> 00:26:13.946
Baynard.

280
00:26:19.577 --> 00:26:22.622
I didn't vote for you, you son of a bitch.

281
00:26:26.251 --> 00:26:28.461
So I'm a lowlife.

282
00:26:38.471 --> 00:26:40.807
That's him. He was with her.

283
00:26:44.019 --> 00:26:46.895
- Get him out of here and kill him.
- There's no contract on him.

284
00:26:47.064 --> 00:26:49.898
Then you'll do it for free,
but just do it elsewhere.

285
00:26:56.448 --> 00:26:58.950
Alex, the pediatrician.

286
00:26:59.285 --> 00:27:02.327
Alex, the pediatrician.

287
00:27:07.875 --> 00:27:11.503
If I were a cat, I'd purr.

288
00:27:12.964 --> 00:27:15.133
Behave.

289
00:27:15.884 --> 00:27:17.884
I want you to come back
to my place with me.

290
00:27:18.053 --> 00:27:19.886
I wanna give you your birthday present.

291
00:27:20.556 --> 00:27:23.057
- Does it look like that?
- Do you want it?

292
00:27:23.224 --> 00:27:25.101
Yeah. What is it? Give me a hint.

293
00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:27.311
A hint? Okay.

294
00:27:29.397 --> 00:27:32.567
How would you like
to get your old job back?

295
00:27:34.111 --> 00:27:36.528
Go on. Get in there.

296
00:27:37.489 --> 00:27:40.450
Wrong place, wrong time.
Nothing personal.

297
00:27:40.616 --> 00:27:43.786
That's what you think.
Last night I fucked your wife.

298
00:27:43.953 --> 00:27:46.955
Oh, you did, huh? Well,
how'd you know it was my wife?

299
00:27:47.124 --> 00:27:50.710
She said her husband was a big
pimp-looking motherfucker with a hat.

300
00:27:50.877 --> 00:27:54.087
Oh, you real cool,
for a guy about to take a bullet.

301
00:27:54.256 --> 00:27:56.214
After fucking your wife, I'll take two.

302
00:27:59.345 --> 00:28:00.720
So talk to me.

303
00:28:00.887 --> 00:28:03.138
What's this about you
getting me my old job back?

304
00:28:03.307 --> 00:28:05.974
- Where the hell is he?
- The detective?

305
00:28:06.643 --> 00:28:08.435
Cory, what kind of trouble are you in?

306
00:28:08.604 --> 00:28:12.272
Trouble? I'm not in any trouble.
Just some creep threatening me.

307
00:28:12.607 --> 00:28:14.650
Let's go back inside
and wait for Hallenbeck.

308
00:28:14.817 --> 00:28:17.944
Hey, what am I, chopped liver?
Hallenbeck's a bum.

309
00:28:18.113 --> 00:28:20.615
What's he gonna do,
light a match and breathe on them?

310
00:28:20.865 --> 00:28:23.116
If this creep shows up, I'll bitch-slap him.

311
00:28:24.787 --> 00:28:27.329
Now, come on, I'll follow you home.
Get in your car.

312
00:28:27.498 --> 00:28:30.875
- You'll bitch-slap him? Ha-ha-ha.
- Yeah. Bitch-slap him.

313
00:28:31.794 --> 00:28:33.627
- Okay.
- Ow!

314
00:28:33.796 --> 00:28:35.587
Watch it.

315
00:28:44.972 --> 00:28:48.308
So now where you want it?
In the chest or in the head?

316
00:28:48.644 --> 00:28:52.688
- Yeah, that's what your wife said.
- Hey, would you stop with the wife shit?

317
00:28:52.855 --> 00:28:55.482
- Ask me how fat she is.
- Fuck you, man.

318
00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:00.738
How fat is she?

319
00:29:00.905 --> 00:29:04.826
She's so fat, I had to roll her in flour
and look for the wet spot.

320
00:29:04.992 --> 00:29:07.744
You wanna fuck her, you gotta
slap her thigh and ride the wave in.

321
00:29:07.913 --> 00:29:10.038
- Ha-ha-ha.
- I'm not saying she's fat...

322
00:29:10.207 --> 00:29:12.583
but her high-school picture
was an aerial photograph.

323
00:29:21.509 --> 00:29:24.261
- Oh, you bastard.
- And then some.

324
00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:46.159
Fuck.

325
00:30:02.884 --> 00:30:04.384
Cory, don't get out of your car.

326
00:30:05.386 --> 00:30:07.262
Can't you fucking drive?

327
00:30:09.141 --> 00:30:10.892
Cory!

328
00:30:18.942 --> 00:30:21.443
Cory! Shit.

329
00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:44.467
Let's get the fuck out of here.

330
00:31:06.448 --> 00:31:08.074
Shit.

331
00:31:12.119 --> 00:31:14.955
Hey, back up.

332
00:31:15.832 --> 00:31:16.832
Back up.

333
00:32:01.711 --> 00:32:03.921
Leather pants?

334
00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:07.299
Yeah.

335
00:32:08.634 --> 00:32:10.845
What's something like that run?

336
00:32:11.805 --> 00:32:13.722
Six-fifty.

337
00:32:14.557 --> 00:32:16.767
- Six hundred and fifty dollars?
- Yeah.

338
00:32:17.102 --> 00:32:19.604
- They're pants?
- Yeah.

339
00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:22.022
- You wear them?
- Yes.

340
00:32:22.773 --> 00:32:25.483
They don't have, like, a TV in them
or something?

341
00:32:25.652 --> 00:32:27.278
Nope.

342
00:32:28.614 --> 00:32:30.364
I am very old.

343
00:32:38.624 --> 00:32:40.082
Something stinks in here.

344
00:32:41.626 --> 00:32:43.044
My God, it's his statement.

345
00:32:43.211 --> 00:32:45.462
It's bullshit.
Hallenbeck is hiding something.

346
00:32:45.631 --> 00:32:48.382
- How do you know?
- I know how the fuck his mind works.

347
00:32:48.549 --> 00:32:51.676
Every lie has 80 percent truth to it.
I mean, it's scary.

348
00:32:52.304 --> 00:32:55.347
- We looking at the same guy?
- Yeah, what is it you're looking at?

349
00:32:55.723 --> 00:32:58.392
I see a guy, looks like
he just slept in his clothes.

350
00:32:58.559 --> 00:33:00.935
Ah. That's what everybody sees.

351
00:33:01.395 --> 00:33:04.022
- There's more?
- Oh, yeah. A lot more.

352
00:33:04.191 --> 00:33:08.693
A long time ago, the same son of a bitch
saved the president's life.

353
00:33:12.074 --> 00:33:15.451
That stuff Cory fed you about some
weirdo hassling her was bullshit, huh?

354
00:33:15.618 --> 00:33:17.161
Yeah.

355
00:33:17.996 --> 00:33:22.375
I don't know what she was into, but that
was a professional hit out there tonight.

356
00:33:23.125 --> 00:33:27.421
Gangland style. The way I figure,
Mike was working for her, same as me.

357
00:33:27.588 --> 00:33:30.799
He gets scared. Very scared.

358
00:33:30.967 --> 00:33:34.427
- Bails out, dumps it in my lap.
- I guess he bailed out too late, huh?

359
00:33:35.888 --> 00:33:37.765
They're still scraping him off my stucco.

360
00:33:40.102 --> 00:33:42.478
If Mike knew this was dangerous...

361
00:33:42.645 --> 00:33:45.314
why did he just hand it to you,
not say anything?

362
00:33:45.481 --> 00:33:46.856
He was fucking my wife.

363
00:33:49.111 --> 00:33:51.319
I die, he gets the wife.

364
00:33:57.493 --> 00:34:00.162
Free to go. Pick up your gun
at the property desk.

365
00:34:00.329 --> 00:34:02.288
- About time.
- You took all day.

366
00:34:02.457 --> 00:34:06.042
And, Joe, I got a call
from the Bel Air P.D.

367
00:34:06.211 --> 00:34:10.965
It seems like Senator Baynard
has been getting obscene phone calls.

368
00:34:11.132 --> 00:34:13.967
I better not find out it's you.

369
00:34:14.469 --> 00:34:16.554
- Anything else, lieutenant?
- Yeah.

370
00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:19.472
There's a new invention.
It's called a razor.

371
00:34:19.641 --> 00:34:24.186
Too risky. I might start thinking about you
and slash my wrists.

372
00:34:25.355 --> 00:34:26.813
He got a beef with Baynard?

373
00:34:26.981 --> 00:34:29.233
Yeah, the senator got him fired
from his old job.

374
00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.860
What was he, a cop or something?

375
00:34:35.449 --> 00:34:38.451
Secret Service, huh?

376
00:34:38.952 --> 00:34:42.329
And Baynard had you fired? How come?

377
00:34:42.496 --> 00:34:44.581
None of your business.

378
00:34:57.094 --> 00:34:59.096
What the fuck are you doing here?

379
00:35:05.561 --> 00:35:07.480
I knocked out four of his teeth.

380
00:35:13.737 --> 00:35:16.405
Say, man, you ever played ball?
You got a good build.

381
00:35:16.572 --> 00:35:17.864
What, are you a fag?

382
00:35:18.032 --> 00:35:19.909
No, I'm just trying to break the ice.

383
00:35:20.076 --> 00:35:22.952
I like ice. Leave it the fuck alone.

384
00:35:23.121 --> 00:35:26.164
- You're a lot of fun to be with.
- Fuck you.

385
00:35:26.333 --> 00:35:29.210
So what's the next move, ace?
Where do we go from here?

386
00:35:29.376 --> 00:35:33.338
I'm going home.
It would seem my job is done.

387
00:35:33.507 --> 00:35:35.965
Fuck you, your job is done.
We saw Cory get murdered.

388
00:35:36.134 --> 00:35:39.094
Listen, Flash, you wanna get
your ass shot off, be my guest.

389
00:35:39.262 --> 00:35:41.722
When you're dead,
I'll take your $600 pants.

390
00:35:43.182 --> 00:35:44.724
Six-fifty.

391
00:35:48.605 --> 00:35:51.148
You look real familiar. Do I know you?

392
00:35:51.315 --> 00:35:53.400
You might. People recognize me.

393
00:35:53.735 --> 00:35:57.530
Got it. Cue Ball Morton.
You used to sell hash in Boyle Heights.

394
00:35:57.697 --> 00:36:00.449
No, I played football.
Jimmy Dix, L.A. Stallions.

395
00:36:00.617 --> 00:36:02.617
- What position?
- Forget it.

396
00:36:02.786 --> 00:36:06.246
Football. Free agents ruined
the goddamn game!

397
00:36:06.623 --> 00:36:10.083
You know, we may run into a few more fans.
You wanna borrow my sunglasses?

398
00:36:10.251 --> 00:36:12.545
- Fuck you.
- Snappy comeback.

399
00:36:13.588 --> 00:36:15.422
So where did Cory live?

400
00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:18.175
Harper Apartments on Melrose. Why?

401
00:36:18.342 --> 00:36:20.594
Thinking about going by there,
take a look around.

402
00:36:20.762 --> 00:36:24.014
- Oh, good. I'll come with you.
- The fuck you are.

403
00:36:24.181 --> 00:36:25.974
Have a nice night, junior.

404
00:36:26.141 --> 00:36:29.853
- Hey, I know where she keeps the extra key.
- I'm not gonna need a key.

405
00:36:30.021 --> 00:36:32.690
Guess you're not worried about
the security system either.

406
00:36:32.858 --> 00:36:35.733
It's pretty high-tech. I put it in myself.

407
00:36:36.402 --> 00:36:38.778
But you probably know
how to circumvent, huh?

408
00:36:39.697 --> 00:36:42.907
- Circumvent?
- It's called a vocabulary. You read much?

409
00:36:43.076 --> 00:36:46.119
My subscription to Jugs Magazine
just ran out.

410
00:36:50.791 --> 00:36:52.876
Get in the car.

411
00:36:56.338 --> 00:36:59.757
How did she afford a place like this?
These joints must run a fortune.

412
00:36:59.925 --> 00:37:03.679
- Tell me about it. I pay the rent.
- Oh, isn't that charming?

413
00:37:04.097 --> 00:37:06.472
She sounds like a real special girl.

414
00:37:06.641 --> 00:37:09.226
What else you give her money for?
Clothes, car payments?

415
00:37:09.393 --> 00:37:10.393
Yo, it wasn't like that.

416
00:37:11.771 --> 00:37:13.813
Cory could've had plenty of rich guys.
Me, she loved.

417
00:37:13.981 --> 00:37:16.150
Oh, love. Well, forget about it, then.

418
00:37:16.318 --> 00:37:20.070
- You don't believe in love?
- Yeah, I believe in love. I believe in cancer.

419
00:37:20.237 --> 00:37:23.324
- What, they're both diseases?
- Yeah, something like that.

420
00:37:24.492 --> 00:37:26.952
I wanna meet the bitch
that fucked you up.

421
00:37:31.708 --> 00:37:34.001
Your show, ace.

422
00:37:39.715 --> 00:37:43.010
- Security system?
- Yeah, I circumvented it.

423
00:37:43.177 --> 00:37:47.014
Don't touch anything.
We don't wanna leave a mess for the cops.

424
00:37:49.099 --> 00:37:50.768
Oh, my God.

425
00:37:52.646 --> 00:37:54.896
- You vacuum, I'll dust.
- Stay put.

426
00:37:56.775 --> 00:37:58.108
Go, Tarzan.

427
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:40.400
Jimmy. Who's this guy with Cory?

428
00:38:41.235 --> 00:38:44.697
Shelly Marcone. He owns the L.A. Stallions.

429
00:38:44.864 --> 00:38:49.076
He used to date her for a while.
He treated her like shit and she left.

430
00:38:49.744 --> 00:38:51.411
- Where you going?
- To the bathroom.

431
00:38:51.579 --> 00:38:54.248
You wanna come? Doc said
I shouldn't lift anything heavy.

432
00:38:54.416 --> 00:38:56.375
No, I'll pass.

433
00:39:34.873 --> 00:39:37.583
Ten to one,
this is what they were looking for.

434
00:39:42.463 --> 00:39:44.590
- That's Marcone.
- Yeah, I know who it is.

435
00:39:44.757 --> 00:39:48.135
- I don't know who this is.
- That's Calvin Baynard, the senator.

436
00:39:48.677 --> 00:39:50.219
And these two assholes with them?

437
00:39:50.387 --> 00:39:53.306
His bodyguards.
He don't go anywhere without protection.

438
00:39:53.474 --> 00:39:57.686
- Xeroxed copy of a phone bill.
- What's this number they keep calling?

439
00:39:57.853 --> 00:40:01.815
- Calvin Baynard's home phone number.
- You know the senator's home number?

440
00:40:02.317 --> 00:40:05.152
Yeah, so I called him a couple times.
Shut the fuck up.

441
00:40:07.864 --> 00:40:12.784
- So, what's all this mean, Joe?
- I don't know, junior. If we're lucky...

442
00:40:12.952 --> 00:40:17.664
enough blackmail evidence to put the two
most powerful men in California away.

443
00:40:18.416 --> 00:40:20.666
Why would Cory wanna blackmail
Marcone or Baynard?

444
00:40:20.835 --> 00:40:24.170
- You said she was fucking Marcone.
- I didn't say fucking, I said dating.

445
00:40:24.338 --> 00:40:27.715
Whatever she was doing, she heard
or saw something. The point is...

446
00:40:27.884 --> 00:40:30.010
- She tried to blackmail them.
- She hires Mike...

447
00:40:30.177 --> 00:40:32.596
- To get evidence against them, right?
- That's right.

448
00:40:32.764 --> 00:40:33.931
Now we have the evidence.

449
00:40:34.099 --> 00:40:37.391
What we got, junior, is Marcone
and Baynard by the nuts.

450
00:40:37.684 --> 00:40:41.021
And that is why I love America.

451
00:40:43.273 --> 00:40:46.110
- Hello?
- Hey, Calvin. Shelly Marcone.

452
00:40:46.277 --> 00:40:48.362
- That's Marcone.
- How you doing this evening?

453
00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:52.574
- I'd prefer you didn't use my name.
- Man's a trifle skittish.

454
00:40:52.742 --> 00:40:57.121
Calvin, if I didn't know you better, I'd think
you were contemplating something shady.

455
00:40:57.288 --> 00:41:00.414
- No law against contemplation.
- Get to the good stuff.

456
00:41:00.583 --> 00:41:03.126
- Not unless you...
- I'll fast-forward.

457
00:41:03.293 --> 00:41:06.547
No, don't! It eats the tape!
Fast-forward eats the fucking tape!

458
00:41:06.713 --> 00:41:10.384
I'm supposed to know that? Our only
evidence and your shitty car ate the tape?

459
00:41:10.552 --> 00:41:12.427
- Fucking car sucks.
- Shut the fuck up!

460
00:41:12.637 --> 00:41:15.722
- Shut your car up.
- If this is ruined, I'm gonna crush your nuts.

461
00:41:15.889 --> 00:41:19.643
Look at this.
This is ruined, I swear to God.

462
00:41:22.896 --> 00:41:25.356
Fast-forward eats the tape.

463
00:41:31.739 --> 00:41:34.449
So this is my birthday present.

464
00:41:36.202 --> 00:41:37.702
What?

465
00:41:38.496 --> 00:41:40.371
Cory was blackmailing Marcone...

466
00:41:40.539 --> 00:41:44.418
but she wasn't trying to get cash.
She was trying to get my old job back.

467
00:41:44.878 --> 00:41:46.753
She's dead because of me.

468
00:41:48.088 --> 00:41:51.257
- Where you going?
- Home. I don't feel too hot.

469
00:41:51.717 --> 00:41:53.342
Come on, I'll take you home.

470
00:41:54.262 --> 00:41:56.137
- Come on, I'll give you a ride.
- No.

471
00:41:56.306 --> 00:41:58.514
I'm gonna take Cory's car. I got the key.

472
00:41:59.057 --> 00:42:01.809
I thought that was Cory's car at the bar.

473
00:42:01.978 --> 00:42:03.103
Jimmy?

474
00:42:14.574 --> 00:42:15.990
Cory had two cars.

475
00:42:23.708 --> 00:42:25.666
Get out of the car! Get out of the car!

476
00:42:25.835 --> 00:42:28.545
What's your trip, man? Yo!
What's wrong with you?

477
00:42:38.139 --> 00:42:39.806
- What is it?
C-4.

478
00:42:40.557 --> 00:42:42.266
Plastic explosive.

479
00:42:42.476 --> 00:42:46.480
They wired the ignition to Mike's car with
this. Figures they'd do the same with hers.

480
00:42:46.648 --> 00:42:48.690
Good thing for you
they wired the wrong car.

481
00:42:48.858 --> 00:42:51.777
Leave this for the cops.
Let them analyze it.

482
00:42:51.945 --> 00:42:53.945
You're just gonna put that in the trunk?

483
00:42:54.112 --> 00:42:57.157
No, we should just leave it
for the neighborhood kids to play with.

484
00:42:57.324 --> 00:42:59.117
Good evening, gentlemen.

485
00:43:08.253 --> 00:43:10.586
Let's have the gun, Hallenbeck.

486
00:43:14.842 --> 00:43:18.052
- A bit late for a stroll, you think?
- You girls ought to get home.

487
00:43:18.221 --> 00:43:20.681
- Yeah, street lights are on.
- Shut up, fuckface.

488
00:43:20.889 --> 00:43:23.182
I'm fuckface, he's asshole.

489
00:43:23.351 --> 00:43:24.601
Jake?

490
00:43:26.019 --> 00:43:29.523
Apprise Rodney Dangerfield here
of his situation.

491
00:43:31.067 --> 00:43:33.693
Perhaps we can dispense
with the fun and games now, yes?

492
00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:37.155
- You want the envelope, right?
- The envelope. Very smart.

493
00:43:37.407 --> 00:43:40.659
See, Jake. Here's a man who knows
when a situation is untenable.

494
00:43:41.034 --> 00:43:43.494
- Good word.
- You like that word?

495
00:43:45.081 --> 00:43:47.373
And you do have that envelope,
don't you?

496
00:43:48.126 --> 00:43:51.460
We better give up, Jimmy.
We're dealing with a couple geniuses here.

497
00:43:53.547 --> 00:43:55.673
All right, man,
just leave him the fuck alone.

498
00:43:56.134 --> 00:43:58.844
"Leave him alone"?
Sure, whatever you say.

499
00:43:59.012 --> 00:44:02.014
Jake attacks his job
with a certain exuberance.

500
00:44:02.472 --> 00:44:05.099
Shit, we're being beat up
by the inventor of Scrabble.

501
00:44:05.559 --> 00:44:09.061
- He's still in a good mood. Kick him again.
- No, no, no. All right.

502
00:44:10.606 --> 00:44:12.356
You want the envelope the hooker had?

503
00:44:12.692 --> 00:44:14.900
- She wasn't a hooker, Joe.
- Shut the fuck up.

504
00:44:15.527 --> 00:44:17.237
Where is it?

505
00:44:18.614 --> 00:44:21.574
- It's in the trunk.
- Give me the keys.

506
00:44:22.909 --> 00:44:25.954
- Come on. Come on.
- Slow and easy.

507
00:44:26.121 --> 00:44:27.621
- Give them to Jake.
- Come on.

508
00:44:29.250 --> 00:44:30.541
Oops.

509
00:44:32.128 --> 00:44:34.880
You dumb bastard,
you're gonna pay for that.

510
00:44:35.882 --> 00:44:37.465
Jake, open the trunk.

511
00:44:48.603 --> 00:44:51.605
Son of a bitch! Go, go, go!

512
00:44:57.612 --> 00:45:00.780
- Are you alive?
- I don't know yet.

513
00:45:01.949 --> 00:45:04.201
- Was that C-4?
- Uh-huh.

514
00:45:04.369 --> 00:45:08.663
- Either that or a hell of a factory recall.
- Dead guys don't make bad jokes, do they?

515
00:45:08.831 --> 00:45:10.998
- No.
- Shit, we're alive.

516
00:45:12.793 --> 00:45:15.336
Yeah. Hooray.

517
00:45:19.217 --> 00:45:21.675
Go on, get out of here.
Go, go, come on.

518
00:45:22.804 --> 00:45:24.637
- You sure?
- I'll take the heat on this.

519
00:45:24.806 --> 00:45:26.681
- You positive? Okay.
- Yeah.

520
00:45:28.976 --> 00:45:31.561
- Aah. Fuck.
- This is a police matter...

521
00:45:31.728 --> 00:45:33.146
you dumb son of a bitch.

522
00:45:33.313 --> 00:45:38.150
And I'm sick and tired
of sweeping up your dead bodies!

523
00:45:38.443 --> 00:45:40.237
The next time I see your ugly mug...

524
00:45:40.405 --> 00:45:43.197
I'm gonna put a bullet in it. You got it?

525
00:45:59.882 --> 00:46:02.925
I just wanted to shake your hand.

526
00:46:03.677 --> 00:46:04.719
What?

527
00:46:04.887 --> 00:46:09.056
Ben told me about what you did
for the president. I respect that.

528
00:46:11.226 --> 00:46:12.978
Thanks.

529
00:46:25.407 --> 00:46:26.699
Hey, ugly.

530
00:46:26.951 --> 00:46:29.786
Looks like our evidence got blown up.

531
00:46:29.954 --> 00:46:32.621
I think we might have to get some more.

532
00:46:35.751 --> 00:46:37.543
You just won't let go, huh?

533
00:46:37.711 --> 00:46:39.378
You're like a dog with a Frisbee.

534
00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:44.092
My girl's dead. The guys that did it are
up at Spago's eating chicken marsala.

535
00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:46.719
And reindeer goat-cheese pizza.

536
00:46:47.679 --> 00:46:48.804
It ain't right.

537
00:46:51.057 --> 00:46:53.476
No, it ain't right.

538
00:47:01.735 --> 00:47:04.237
This ain't no game, Flash.

539
00:47:04.822 --> 00:47:06.405
Real guns.

540
00:47:06.574 --> 00:47:08.699
Real bullets.

541
00:47:09.242 --> 00:47:10.784
It's dangerous.

542
00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:13.246
Danger's my middle name.

543
00:47:14.289 --> 00:47:16.541
Mine's Cornelius.

544
00:47:16.791 --> 00:47:18.751
You tell anybody, I'll kill you.

545
00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:21.963
- You ever watch Soul Train?
- Shut the fuck up.

546
00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:24.132
We start tomorrow.

547
00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:28.177
In the meantime, I'd like to
go home and see my family.

548
00:47:38.146 --> 00:47:40.023
Your family, huh?

549
00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:41.942
You got kids?

550
00:47:42.108 --> 00:47:44.110
- A little girl.
- Does she like you?

551
00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:47.112
No, not too much.

552
00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:50.032
She likes Prince. Go figure.

553
00:47:50.242 --> 00:47:51.617
I like Prince.

554
00:48:02.295 --> 00:48:05.130
Wow. An actual house.

555
00:48:05.298 --> 00:48:09.260
I was thinking a cave
with skulls and shit.

556
00:48:12.597 --> 00:48:15.934
I feel like I've been rode hard
and put away wet.

557
00:48:16.101 --> 00:48:17.643
What the hell does that mean?

558
00:48:17.811 --> 00:48:19.896
It's horse talk, man.

559
00:48:20.273 --> 00:48:22.023
They got the brothers riding horses now?

560
00:48:22.190 --> 00:48:24.733
Yeah, cars are getting too hard to steal.

561
00:48:24.902 --> 00:48:26.695
You ever wear, like, a little cowboy hat?

562
00:48:26.862 --> 00:48:29.905
Ha-ha-ha. I'm really good, man.

563
00:48:30.074 --> 00:48:31.949
Maybe I could take your daughter out.

564
00:48:32.117 --> 00:48:33.909
She's 13, and if you look at her funny...

565
00:48:34.077 --> 00:48:36.204
I'll stick an umbrella up your ass
and open it.

566
00:48:43.545 --> 00:48:46.172
- Why aren't you in bed?
- Darian's watching TV.

567
00:48:48.592 --> 00:48:51.802
- Yeah, I can see that.
- She's also pissed at you bigtime.

568
00:48:55.141 --> 00:48:59.101
- What happened to your face?
- My God. It speaks.

569
00:48:59.936 --> 00:49:02.856
Nothing happened to my face.
It always looks like this.

570
00:49:03.023 --> 00:49:04.398
What's wrong with his face?

571
00:49:04.692 --> 00:49:08.737
His nose is too pointy. His eyes are beady.
His ears are too big.

572
00:49:09.155 --> 00:49:11.030
- He needs a shave.
- Oh, oh, oh.

573
00:49:11.574 --> 00:49:14.117
I am peeing my pants,
you're so funny out here.

574
00:49:14.994 --> 00:49:16.577
That's my daughter, Darian.

575
00:49:17.704 --> 00:49:21.081
- My name is Jimmy.
- That number on the back of your head...

576
00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:24.628
is that, like, a license plate
in case somebody tries to steal it?

577
00:49:25.295 --> 00:49:28.465
No, it's a football thing.
It's my high-school number.

578
00:49:29.257 --> 00:49:30.382
So when do you graduate?

579
00:49:32.344 --> 00:49:34.846
You wanna be left alone, don't you?

580
00:49:35.639 --> 00:49:37.389
I'll be in the kitchen.

581
00:49:37.724 --> 00:49:39.391
Over here.

582
00:49:44.815 --> 00:49:47.650
Hey, Joe,
she's got your winning personality.

583
00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:49.860
You get used to it.

584
00:49:50.237 --> 00:49:52.280
Darian, I got some ice cream.
You want some?

585
00:49:52.572 --> 00:49:54.865
Leave me alone! I hate you!

586
00:49:56.786 --> 00:49:59.954
She's pissed because I wouldn't let her
go out on a date with Tommy.

587
00:50:00.121 --> 00:50:02.666
I only missed the best party of the year.

588
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.626
Why didn't you let her go?

589
00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:08.253
Because she's 13 years old, jerk-off.

590
00:50:10.090 --> 00:50:13.217
- You want some of this ice cream or not?
- I'm not talking to you.

591
00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:15.094
Oh, that's a shame.

592
00:50:15.262 --> 00:50:19.099
I'll miss all those pleasant things you
always say to me. "Hey, Dad, I hate you."

593
00:50:20.393 --> 00:50:23.894
- It's chocolate chip, your favorite.
- I don't care.

594
00:50:24.063 --> 00:50:25.271
You're an asshole.

595
00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:35.824
You know how I hate to waste food.

596
00:50:36.784 --> 00:50:39.661
You wanna abuse me some more?
Shock me.

597
00:50:40.121 --> 00:50:42.621
- I hardly ever hear the word "asshole."
- Oh, bullshit!

598
00:50:42.789 --> 00:50:45.291
- Enough. That's enough.
- Bet you get it all the time!

599
00:50:45.458 --> 00:50:48.335
- What'll you do, ground me some more?
- You want it, you got it.

600
00:50:48.713 --> 00:50:50.130
Yes, sir, asshole.

601
00:50:50.297 --> 00:50:52.965
- You're grounded for a week. Hey.
- Just leave me alone!

602
00:50:53.134 --> 00:50:54.884
He thinks he's fucking Ward Cleaver.

603
00:50:55.052 --> 00:50:58.471
You wanna talk like a trash-mouth?
Wanna sound like your mother? Go ahead.

604
00:50:58.639 --> 00:51:02.516
It's bad enough I gotta hear this shit
all day, I gotta get it from you too?

605
00:51:02.851 --> 00:51:04.853
Joe, why don't you go easy
on the girl, man?

606
00:51:05.019 --> 00:51:06.855
Don't tell me how to talk to my kid.

607
00:51:07.021 --> 00:51:10.442
Come on, let me hear it. Let me hear
all the really juicy, dirty words.

608
00:51:10.608 --> 00:51:12.068
God, you're such a fuckup.

609
00:51:14.362 --> 00:51:15.405
Damn it, Darian.

610
00:51:15.572 --> 00:51:19.032
You are my daughter, you're in my house.
You will respect me. You got that?

611
00:51:19.201 --> 00:51:21.327
- Don't ever call me a fuckup.
- Why shouldn't I?

612
00:51:21.494 --> 00:51:23.288
Mom calls you one all the time.

613
00:51:24.581 --> 00:51:27.876
Your mother called me a fuckup? When?

614
00:51:28.168 --> 00:51:31.253
- On the phone with Uncle Jay.
- Uncle Jay?

615
00:51:31.922 --> 00:51:37.092
Oh, Christ. I'm a fuckup, but Uncle Jay,
now, there's a real stand-up guy.

616
00:51:37.344 --> 00:51:40.012
Cheats on his taxes.
Surprised he's not doing time.

617
00:51:40.181 --> 00:51:43.849
Go ask your mother why Mr. Wonderful
is not in jail for tax evasion.

618
00:51:44.018 --> 00:51:47.603
- Because he doesn't fuck up.
- Darian.

619
00:51:48.481 --> 00:51:49.521
Go to bed.

620
00:52:01.702 --> 00:52:05.163
For 50 bucks, you could pay a guy
to pull her fingernails out one by one.

621
00:52:06.039 --> 00:52:08.248
Anything that much fun,
I think I'd rather do it myself.

622
00:52:11.128 --> 00:52:13.797
Hey, I don't know about you,
but I could use a drink.

623
00:52:13.963 --> 00:52:15.590
Yes.

624
00:52:18.385 --> 00:52:20.219
Oh, shit. That's you?

625
00:52:20.429 --> 00:52:22.096
You were fucking Ward Cleaver.

626
00:52:23.516 --> 00:52:25.557
Yeah, I was a regular Boy Scout.

627
00:52:27.561 --> 00:52:29.603
You and the president.

628
00:52:29.771 --> 00:52:32.190
Damn, hanging with the man.

629
00:52:32.358 --> 00:52:36.193
That look like one of those cardboard
cutout things you see in Venice Beach.

630
00:52:36.362 --> 00:52:38.905
I once had my picture taken
with Don Johnson like that.

631
00:52:39.072 --> 00:52:42.157
- You still got the picture?
- Nah, I threw it away.

632
00:52:44.119 --> 00:52:46.621
So are you gonna get a divorce, man?

633
00:52:47.748 --> 00:52:49.916
Shit, I don't know.

634
00:52:50.583 --> 00:52:52.585
You don't like women much,
do you, Joe?

635
00:52:53.838 --> 00:52:55.755
At least I liked the guy she was fucking.

636
00:52:57.257 --> 00:52:59.175
- He was my best friend.
- Nah.

637
00:52:59.342 --> 00:53:01.594
He was
a scumbag private detective, man.

638
00:53:01.804 --> 00:53:05.306
Man, all private detectives
are scumbags.

639
00:53:05.474 --> 00:53:08.184
Yeah, but that scumbag
tried to get you killed.

640
00:53:08.351 --> 00:53:11.980
Well, friends can't be perfect.

641
00:53:14.608 --> 00:53:16.775
I wish the sky wasn't blue...

642
00:53:16.943 --> 00:53:19.528
I wish water wasn't wet...

643
00:53:19.989 --> 00:53:22.155
and I wish I didn't still love my wife.

644
00:53:30.708 --> 00:53:32.166
Ah. Life sucks.

645
00:53:33.501 --> 00:53:37.255
- To Alex, the accountant.
- Your accountant's name is Alex?

646
00:53:38.298 --> 00:53:39.882
No...

647
00:53:42.719 --> 00:53:44.804
but he could have been.

648
00:53:45.597 --> 00:53:47.806
Alex was my son.

649
00:53:51.144 --> 00:53:53.228
I used to be married.

650
00:53:56.608 --> 00:53:59.527
One Sunday, I'm away in Miami.

651
00:54:00.445 --> 00:54:03.655
She couldn't come because
she was eight months' pregnant.

652
00:54:04.532 --> 00:54:07.327
Walking down La Brea Boulevard...

653
00:54:07.494 --> 00:54:09.829
out of nowhere a pickup truck
jumped a curb. Pow.

654
00:54:11.706 --> 00:54:13.791
Never knew what hit her.

655
00:54:15.168 --> 00:54:17.128
She died.

656
00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:27.137
But Alex lived for 17 minutes
in an incubator.

657
00:54:29.016 --> 00:54:30.934
He fell asleep...

658
00:54:31.893 --> 00:54:34.353
had time for one dream...

659
00:54:35.188 --> 00:54:36.773
and then he died.

660
00:54:51.204 --> 00:54:53.748
I think about him all the time, man.

661
00:54:56.376 --> 00:54:59.670
You know, I threw for 300 yards that day.

662
00:55:00.088 --> 00:55:02.882
While my wife and kid were dying...

663
00:55:03.967 --> 00:55:06.302
I had the game of my life.

664
00:55:11.557 --> 00:55:13.059
Life sucks.

665
00:55:14.811 --> 00:55:18.856
- Hey, could I use your shower?
- Yeah.

666
00:55:20.358 --> 00:55:23.235
Bathroom, down the hall,
first door on the right.

667
00:55:31.704 --> 00:55:34.329
Hey, Flash, I brought you a towel.

668
00:55:37.668 --> 00:55:38.918
Hey.

669
00:55:47.135 --> 00:55:49.762
This is what you were looking for
in Cory's apartment?

670
00:55:50.264 --> 00:55:51.597
Huh?

671
00:55:51.764 --> 00:55:53.306
This what you were looking for?

672
00:55:53.474 --> 00:55:55.351
- That's $1,000 worth of shit!
- Shut the fuck up!

673
00:55:56.936 --> 00:55:59.605
Get the fuck out of my house
before I break your goddamn neck.

674
00:56:05.112 --> 00:56:06.445
I use that shit to get by.

675
00:56:07.155 --> 00:56:09.657
I don't use it. I get by.

676
00:56:11.284 --> 00:56:14.704
- Get dressed and get out.
- Oh, right. I forgot.

677
00:56:14.871 --> 00:56:16.956
I'm talking to Dudley-fucking-Do-Right.

678
00:56:18.791 --> 00:56:21.626
Well, the shit happens real easy, man.

679
00:56:21.795 --> 00:56:23.920
It starts out...

680
00:56:25.090 --> 00:56:30.385
painkillers. Using Demerol
because your fucking knees are shot!

681
00:56:31.472 --> 00:56:36.016
Before you know it, you're chewing
codeine with your pancakes.

682
00:56:37.268 --> 00:56:39.311
And then a truck comes out of nowhere...

683
00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:41.606
and you're talking to God, saying:

684
00:56:41.773 --> 00:56:44.525
"Hey, help me out, Big Guy.

685
00:56:44.693 --> 00:56:48.905
I pay taxes. I go to church.
What's with this dead-wife-and-kid shit?"

686
00:56:50.532 --> 00:56:52.574
But he ain't answering.

687
00:56:52.742 --> 00:56:55.119
He ain't taking no calls that day.

688
00:56:55.536 --> 00:56:58.539
Instead, I get a call
from the fucking league.

689
00:56:58.706 --> 00:57:02.918
And they're saying,
"Hey, kid, your career's over."

690
00:57:03.295 --> 00:57:04.836
And I say, "Why?"

691
00:57:05.005 --> 00:57:07.340
Because I gambled.

692
00:57:07.507 --> 00:57:11.052
Why is there a fucking injury report
in pro football, huh?

693
00:57:11.219 --> 00:57:15.181
Nobody else has one.
Pro football does.

694
00:57:15.349 --> 00:57:17.349
You know why?

695
00:57:17.518 --> 00:57:20.186
That's so the gamblers will have
a fucking accurate spread!

696
00:57:20.728 --> 00:57:24.481
It's all business now. They push you
until you blow your fucking brains out!

697
00:57:24.650 --> 00:57:25.858
Just like Billy Cole did!

698
00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:30.070
Can't you see those fucking hypocrites
took away my fucking life?

699
00:57:32.365 --> 00:57:36.202
When you're done feeling sorry
for yourself, the front door's that way.

700
00:57:43.543 --> 00:57:45.836
You bastard.

701
00:57:48.715 --> 00:57:50.800
And then some.

702
00:57:56.889 --> 00:57:58.766
Jimmy Dix.

703
00:58:00.351 --> 00:58:01.393
Will you sign my card?

704
00:58:04.398 --> 00:58:07.900
- I'm sorry I was so bitchy before.
- Sure.

705
00:58:08.068 --> 00:58:11.487
- I guess your dad's pretty pissed, huh?
- Yeah, but he'll get over it.

706
00:58:12.739 --> 00:58:16.242
- You were only, like, his biggest hero.
- Oh, yeah. Since when?

707
00:58:16.409 --> 00:58:17.994
Since I was little.

708
00:58:18.161 --> 00:58:22.248
You should've heard him. "Jimmy this.
Jimmy that. Best quarterback in the game."

709
00:58:22.416 --> 00:58:24.750
When you got busted,
he quit watching football.

710
00:58:28.130 --> 00:58:30.755
Does he punch all his heroes?

711
00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:57.282
- Good morning, Jimmy.
- Who are you? How do you know my name?

712
00:58:57.451 --> 00:59:00.661
- Now, this is the guy? Sure this is the guy?
- This is him.

713
00:59:00.829 --> 00:59:04.289
This is the kid with the million-dollar arm,
huh? He don't look like much.

714
00:59:04.458 --> 00:59:07.083
I can't figure which of you
looks the most like my dick.

715
00:59:07.293 --> 00:59:11.213
So if you got something to say, say it,
otherwise get the fuck out of my way.

716
00:59:15.135 --> 00:59:17.344
Grab him. Grab him.

717
00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:33.193
It's okay. It's okay, folks.

718
00:59:33.362 --> 00:59:34.612
- What happened?
- Hey.

719
00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:36.364
It's okay. It's okay.

720
00:59:36.907 --> 00:59:38.574
Thank you. Thank you.

721
00:59:39.034 --> 00:59:40.576
Danger is my middle name.

722
00:59:41.161 --> 00:59:44.038
Don't try this at home, folks.
I'm a trained professional.

723
00:59:44.331 --> 00:59:45.998
There's me...

724
00:59:46.166 --> 00:59:47.458
and there's Super Dave.

725
00:59:53.257 --> 00:59:56.509
- I got bad news and bad news.
- Give me the bad news first.

726
00:59:56.677 --> 00:59:59.469
Bad news is someone just
bounced Jimmy Dix off a car.

727
00:59:59.846 --> 01:00:01.222
Now give me the bad news.

728
01:00:01.389 --> 01:00:04.099
I just took a statement
from Joe Hallenbeck's neighbor.

729
01:00:04.268 --> 01:00:07.269
On the day he died, Mike Matthews
came to Hallenbeck's house...

730
01:00:07.436 --> 01:00:11.398
early in the morning to discuss a case.
- That's what Hallenbeck says.

731
01:00:11.565 --> 01:00:14.025
Okay. So how come
Hallenbeck's neighbor claims...

732
01:00:14.193 --> 01:00:17.862
Matthews' car was parked there
all night in the same spot?

733
01:00:21.076 --> 01:00:23.034
Why did he lie?

734
01:00:27.373 --> 01:00:30.626
Matthews is fucking his wife.

735
01:00:31.003 --> 01:00:34.672
That's why the car was there.
Matthews was fucking Hallenbeck's wife.

736
01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:36.965
Hallenbeck just got back into town, right?

737
01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:41.177
Christ. Joe wasted the bastard himself.

738
01:00:44.641 --> 01:00:47.476
He waltzed right out of my office.

739
01:00:47.643 --> 01:00:49.478
I let the son of a bitch go.

740
01:00:49.646 --> 01:00:51.688
Give me a chance, Ben. I'll get him back.

741
01:01:26.516 --> 01:01:27.891
Tommy.

742
01:01:30.103 --> 01:01:32.021
Jesus.

743
01:01:36.943 --> 01:01:40.070
You can go to a party when
you're 17 years old, not before.

744
01:01:43.199 --> 01:01:44.240
Good morning, Joseph.

745
01:02:05.679 --> 01:02:07.389
Looks like we got trouble, Milo.

746
01:02:08.224 --> 01:02:11.184
Pick up Hallenbeck's gun by
the trigger guard. Give it to me.

747
01:02:16.733 --> 01:02:18.400
Good morning. Is there a problem?

748
01:02:18.568 --> 01:02:20.693
Yes, officer. As a matter of fact, there is.

749
01:02:20.862 --> 01:02:23.447
Apparently, there are
too many bullets in this gun.

750
01:02:26.867 --> 01:02:28.869
Fingerprints.

751
01:02:31.331 --> 01:02:34.916
Naughty boy, Joseph.
You just shot a policeman.

752
01:02:51.016 --> 01:02:53.018
Down!

753
01:03:03.112 --> 01:03:05.364
It's you, Daddy.

754
01:03:05.532 --> 01:03:08.284
It's you, Daddy.

755
01:03:13.873 --> 01:03:16.375
- I think he's awake.
- Make sure.

756
01:03:24.925 --> 01:03:26.217
Shit!

757
01:03:26.844 --> 01:03:28.052
I'm awake.

758
01:03:29.681 --> 01:03:31.264
You nearly broke my wrist, man.

759
01:03:32.184 --> 01:03:36.061
- Milo warned us to watch out for this guy.
- Fuck that!

760
01:03:36.228 --> 01:03:39.481
Fuck you. Fuck that. Look at him.
He's nothing. Guy's a piece of shit.

761
01:03:40.275 --> 01:03:41.900
You got a cigarette?

762
01:03:42.568 --> 01:03:43.735
A cigarette? Yeah, sure.

763
01:03:44.905 --> 01:03:46.655
I got a cigarette.

764
01:03:49.326 --> 01:03:52.911
- You got a light?
- Yeah. I got a light.

765
01:04:01.588 --> 01:04:04.130
Hey, baby. I thought you were tough.

766
01:04:05.090 --> 01:04:07.384
See, Pablo? He's not so bad.

767
01:04:12.641 --> 01:04:15.099
I seem to have dropped my cigarette.

768
01:04:18.521 --> 01:04:19.730
May I have another?

769
01:04:24.402 --> 01:04:25.985
Sure.

770
01:04:26.487 --> 01:04:28.364
Sure thing, buddy.

771
01:04:34.579 --> 01:04:36.664
I'm gonna need a light.

772
01:04:38.083 --> 01:04:39.791
If you touch me again, I'll kill you.

773
01:04:47.259 --> 01:04:49.092
Boom-ba! Baby!

774
01:04:52.639 --> 01:04:56.559
Oh, baby. Two for two.
We got a two for two.

775
01:05:02.023 --> 01:05:03.565
Told you.

776
01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.485
Jesus Christ.

777
01:05:09.405 --> 01:05:13.659
You killed him. You fucking-A killed him!
He's dead!

778
01:05:15.704 --> 01:05:16.869
Is there a problem?

779
01:05:17.414 --> 01:05:19.539
He just killed Chet, Milo.
He just killed him.

780
01:05:19.708 --> 01:05:21.666
He put his fucking nose
through his brain.

781
01:05:22.085 --> 01:05:23.126
I needed a light.

782
01:05:26.088 --> 01:05:28.715
Joseph, you don't disappoint me.

783
01:05:30.010 --> 01:05:33.344
You took an awful risk.
Pablo here could've shot you dead.

784
01:05:33.512 --> 01:05:36.514
If you wanted me dead,
you'd have killed me already.

785
01:05:36.849 --> 01:05:38.684
That's true.

786
01:05:40.853 --> 01:05:44.398
- Can we do a formal introduction?
- Who gives a fuck?

787
01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:47.775
- You're the bad guy, right?
- I am the bad guy.

788
01:05:47.943 --> 01:05:50.528
And I'm supposed to be
trembling with fear?

789
01:05:50.697 --> 01:05:54.157
- Something like that, yeah.
- Fine.

790
01:05:54.326 --> 01:05:58.536
I'll start trembling in a minute.
In the meantime, think I could have a drink?

791
01:05:58.704 --> 01:06:00.789
I don't see why not. Pablo.

792
01:06:00.956 --> 01:06:04.083
Take Chet's corpse out of here
and fix Mr. Hallenbeck a drink.

793
01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:05.543
Make that two.

794
01:06:09.215 --> 01:06:12.092
Well, if it isn't Shelly Marcone himself.

795
01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:15.554
Careful, son.
Just my friends call me Shelly.

796
01:06:16.306 --> 01:06:18.766
You got friends?
When did this happen?

797
01:06:20.393 --> 01:06:24.730
Boy, I'll give you this. You sure
are feisty for a fella in your position.

798
01:06:25.565 --> 01:06:27.608
Milo, teach him some manners, will you?

799
01:06:33.989 --> 01:06:35.574
You touch me again, I'll kill you.

800
01:06:41.748 --> 01:06:41.789
What fucking conspiracy
are you talking about?

801
01:06:41.789 --> 01:06:44.291
What fucking conspiracy
are you talking about?

802
01:06:44.458 --> 01:06:48.628
Hallenbeck is a fruit loop, okay?
He's been after Senator Baynard for years.

803
01:06:48.797 --> 01:06:52.007
Now, you want me to believe
that the senator's mixed up in this?

804
01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:56.135
Look, I'm gonna say it again
for the cheap seats, lieutenant.

805
01:06:56.637 --> 01:07:00.474
I don't know where Joe Hallenbeck is!
That's my fucking statement.

806
01:07:00.641 --> 01:07:02.976
Write it down and shove it up your ass.

807
01:07:03.519 --> 01:07:05.228
I could nail you for obstruction.

808
01:07:05.396 --> 01:07:09.900
You couldn't nail a $2 whore. Charge me with
something or let me get the fuck out of here!

809
01:07:10.068 --> 01:07:12.110
My husband did not kill a cop.

810
01:07:12.653 --> 01:07:16.447
And aside from that, I can't help you.
May we go now?

811
01:07:16.990 --> 01:07:19.827
Can I have a minute with
your mom in private, please?

812
01:07:19.994 --> 01:07:21.744
- Pleasure.
- Thank you.

813
01:07:24.456 --> 01:07:26.958
Do you deny being involved
in a sexual relationship...

814
01:07:27.126 --> 01:07:29.795
with Michael Matthews
prior to his death?

815
01:07:30.672 --> 01:07:31.838
Why am I calling?

816
01:07:32.005 --> 01:07:34.925
Because I had to hear your sweet voice.
And I need a favor.

817
01:07:35.217 --> 01:07:39.972
No, it ain't like that.
No, it wasn't no liquor talking.

818
01:07:40.139 --> 01:07:42.932
You're not fat.
You're just a whole lot of woman.

819
01:07:43.101 --> 01:07:44.518
Now, do me a favor, big mama.

820
01:07:44.686 --> 01:07:47.896
Senator Calvin Baynard.
He's a season ticket holder, right?

821
01:07:48.313 --> 01:07:51.900
I need you to punch up his address
and tell me where you send the tickets.

822
01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:57.364
Great.

823
01:07:58.199 --> 01:07:59.824
Good girl.

824
01:08:01.827 --> 01:08:03.494
- Yeah, bye.
- Bye.

825
01:08:04.371 --> 01:08:06.164
Great.

826
01:08:07.583 --> 01:08:10.085
- Don't worry. I'm gonna find your dad, okay?
- How?

827
01:08:11.086 --> 01:08:14.130
When in doubt, try the nearest bad guy.

828
01:08:18.427 --> 01:08:20.511
Football is a dying beast, Joe.

829
01:08:22.806 --> 01:08:25.975
No heroes left. Not anymore.

830
01:08:26.478 --> 01:08:31.606
Since old Sonny Werblin paid
$400,000 to Joe Namath in '66...

831
01:08:31.774 --> 01:08:34.025
the son of a bitches
have just gotten greedier.

832
01:08:34.527 --> 01:08:37.237
God Almighty, when's it enough?

833
01:08:37.654 --> 01:08:41.574
Jesus, free agents.
"Give me, give me, give me."

834
01:08:41.743 --> 01:08:45.953
Now you got guys on PCP wigging out
and shooting themselves on the field.

835
01:08:46.331 --> 01:08:50.958
The American public is pisspot tired of it
and they're changing the channel.

836
01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:53.212
The ratings are down.

837
01:08:53.837 --> 01:08:56.798
So you're gonna bribe some senators
to legalize gambling.

838
01:08:57.050 --> 01:09:00.176
Legalize sports gambling.

839
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:02.970
You see, with all the heroes gone...

840
01:09:03.389 --> 01:09:07.059
legalized gambling is about
the only thing that'll save the beast.

841
01:09:07.226 --> 01:09:08.726
You follow me, Joe?

842
01:09:09.061 --> 01:09:13.398
We're talking about some big bucks here.
We're talking about billions.

843
01:09:13.565 --> 01:09:15.650
That's nine zeroes, son.

844
01:09:16.069 --> 01:09:17.319
I'm not your fucking son.

845
01:09:20.698 --> 01:09:24.158
Well, Joe, have you ever heard
of the Senate's Commission...

846
01:09:24.327 --> 01:09:26.869
to Investigate Gambling
in Professional Sports?

847
01:09:27.247 --> 01:09:31.250
- Is that who you're paying off?
- The commission's gonna vote next March.

848
01:09:31.417 --> 01:09:35.587
I got every one in my hip pocket,
except Senator Calvin Baynard.

849
01:09:35.755 --> 01:09:38.172
I tried to bribe that son of a bitch, Joe.

850
01:09:38.925 --> 01:09:40.842
He gave it back because it wasn't enough.

851
01:09:43.429 --> 01:09:45.930
- What's he want?
- Six million.

852
01:09:46.099 --> 01:09:48.766
Or he'll go straight to the police.

853
01:09:49.435 --> 01:09:52.395
I think it's just gonna be cheaper
to kill that son of a bitch.

854
01:09:54.023 --> 01:09:57.484
Taking off a U.S. senator is ballsy,
even for an asshole like you.

855
01:09:57.652 --> 01:09:59.610
You said it, Joe boy.

856
01:09:59.779 --> 01:10:03.448
That's why we're gonna frame you
for the senator's murder.

857
01:10:06.286 --> 01:10:09.621
As chairman of the commission
on sports gambling, I'll simply say this:

858
01:10:09.956 --> 01:10:15.836
I'm currently reviewing both sides of
the issue with utmost care and scrutiny...

859
01:10:16.003 --> 01:10:20.131
and will adopt a position based on
my firm belief in what's best for the sport.

860
01:10:21.259 --> 01:10:23.135
In the meantime...

861
01:10:23.595 --> 01:10:27.471
I can't wait to get to the Coliseum
to watch my favorite L.A. team...

862
01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:31.560
- ... kick hell out of Tampa Bay.
- Cut.

863
01:10:32.311 --> 01:10:36.314
- Thank you, senator.
- My pleasure. Thank you. Always a pleasure.

864
01:10:39.359 --> 01:10:42.988
Okay. Come on, Jimmy, think, think, think.
What would Joe do?

865
01:10:43.155 --> 01:10:47.408
He'd shoot everybody and smoke some
cigarettes. I don't have a gun. I can't do that.

866
01:10:47.577 --> 01:10:48.659
Whoa!

867
01:10:51.163 --> 01:10:53.957
- How'd you get here?
- I hitched.

868
01:10:55.335 --> 01:10:58.377
That's not what I meant.
I meant, how did you find me?

869
01:11:00.381 --> 01:11:02.716
My dad's a detective. What can I say?

870
01:11:04.594 --> 01:11:07.095
You didn't cover your tracks.
You're easy to trace.

871
01:11:07.512 --> 01:11:10.765
- Just what I need. Nancy-fucking-Drew.
- I brought you this.

872
01:11:10.934 --> 01:11:13.435
- I figured you might need it.
- Where did you get that?

873
01:11:13.603 --> 01:11:16.604
Stole it from my dad's closet.
He'd kill me if he found out.

874
01:11:16.773 --> 01:11:21.568
You'll kill yourself first, you jerk. Come on,
take this ugly monkey and get out of here.

875
01:11:21.735 --> 01:11:23.319
- Go, get out.
- Wait.

876
01:11:23.488 --> 01:11:25.780
- I wanna know what's going on.
- Watch CNN. Go.

877
01:11:27.658 --> 01:11:31.036
Oh, shit. Those are the bodyguards
from the picture.

878
01:11:31.537 --> 01:11:33.454
- So?
- They're leaving without the senator.

879
01:11:33.622 --> 01:11:35.332
I have to follow them. Now go.

880
01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:38.585
- I'm coming with you.
- You can't come with me, Darian. Go home.

881
01:11:38.752 --> 01:11:40.045
- Kiss my ass.
- Darian.

882
01:11:40.253 --> 01:11:44.800
- Kiss my ass. Is that clear enough?
- Fine.

883
01:11:44.967 --> 01:11:46.717
You little brat.

884
01:11:46.886 --> 01:11:49.805
We're just gonna follow them.
How dangerous can that be, right?

885
01:11:50.472 --> 01:11:51.890
Right.

886
01:11:57.604 --> 01:11:58.814
We're in position.

887
01:11:58.981 --> 01:12:03.234
The senator's men are en route.
ETA, five minutes.

888
01:12:18.126 --> 01:12:20.585
Damn, now where are they going?

889
01:12:20.752 --> 01:12:22.503
Let's find out. Here.

890
01:12:22.921 --> 01:12:25.966
I told you no guns, right? I hate guns.

891
01:12:26.591 --> 01:12:28.969
Now, you stay here. I'm gonna go
look around. Stay!

892
01:12:29.136 --> 01:12:30.554
Woof.

893
01:12:44.777 --> 01:12:47.112
- Six mil.
- Excuse me.

894
01:12:47.279 --> 01:12:52.492
Did any of you stupid shits
bother to frisk this fuck?

895
01:12:52.659 --> 01:12:55.578
He could be a goddamn cop.
Will you frisk him, please?

896
01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:02.586
Take it easy, huh?

897
01:13:05.422 --> 01:13:08.466
- It's okay.
- Hand him the briefcase, Joseph.

898
01:13:22.189 --> 01:13:24.024
Nice suit.

899
01:13:32.658 --> 01:13:35.534
That briefcase was loaded with explosives,
wasn't it?

900
01:13:35.703 --> 01:13:39.747
Ten pounds of C-4 is on the way
to the Coliseum right now.

901
01:13:39.916 --> 01:13:42.000
It's ironic, don't you think?

902
01:13:42.167 --> 01:13:46.671
That this bomb's gonna be delivered to
Baynard by his own personal bodyguards.

903
01:13:46.838 --> 01:13:48.465
After his death...

904
01:13:48.632 --> 01:13:51.467
the police will receive
a photograph of you, Joseph...

905
01:13:51.636 --> 01:13:55.930
handing over the briefcase,
and blame you for the crime.

906
01:13:56.681 --> 01:14:00.226
And they'll believe it too because
they know what a fan of Baynard's you are.

907
01:14:00.394 --> 01:14:02.104
Go fuck yourself.

908
01:14:02.854 --> 01:14:05.398
Okay, now, that's not polite.

909
01:14:06.234 --> 01:14:09.110
It's very abusive sounding.

910
01:14:10.029 --> 01:14:11.613
What would you do, Joseph...

911
01:14:12.198 --> 01:14:15.117
if somebody told you
to go fuck yourself?

912
01:14:18.121 --> 01:14:20.956
Would you cut one of their eyes out?

913
01:14:21.207 --> 01:14:23.375
- No.
- No.

914
01:14:24.292 --> 01:14:25.585
What would you do?

915
01:14:32.176 --> 01:14:33.217
Oh.

916
01:14:34.261 --> 01:14:36.470
You think you're so fucking cool,
don't you?

917
01:14:37.222 --> 01:14:39.390
You think you're so fucking cool.

918
01:14:40.225 --> 01:14:42.144
Well, just once...

919
01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:44.395
I would like to hear you scream...

920
01:14:44.771 --> 01:14:46.189
in pain.

921
01:14:49.652 --> 01:14:51.278
Play some rap music.

922
01:14:56.324 --> 01:14:58.159
Come on, move.

923
01:15:05.417 --> 01:15:08.002
Hey, Flash. Rescue attempt?

924
01:15:08.503 --> 01:15:11.088
- Blow me.
- You must be James.

925
01:15:11.673 --> 01:15:14.426
- James?
- He does that with everybody.

926
01:15:14.594 --> 01:15:16.970
- Calls me Joseph.
- I trust you're alone.

927
01:15:17.387 --> 01:15:19.930
No, I got the fucking
Vienna Boys Choir with me.

928
01:15:20.099 --> 01:15:22.391
What, is everybody stupid around here?

929
01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:23.810
Oh! Oh!

930
01:15:24.103 --> 01:15:26.520
- Just you, kid.
- Shoot them and bury them.

931
01:15:29.483 --> 01:15:32.402
- Scared?
- Shitless. You?

932
01:15:32.569 --> 01:15:35.113
- More or less.
- Hey, Milo.

933
01:15:41.328 --> 01:15:43.872
Hey, mister. Do you like my puppet?

934
01:15:44.623 --> 01:15:45.664
Get this kid out of here.

935
01:15:45.832 --> 01:15:48.042
My name is Furry Tom.

936
01:15:48.211 --> 01:15:50.795
- I said, get out of here, kid.
- No. The kid stays.

937
01:15:52.215 --> 01:15:55.716
Can you make him talk? Huh?

938
01:15:57.636 --> 01:15:59.930
Go on. Try.

939
01:16:03.475 --> 01:16:04.809
Go ahead. Take it.

940
01:16:09.439 --> 01:16:12.234
Okay. It's riddle time.

941
01:16:12.734 --> 01:16:15.278
Why did Mr. Milo cross the road?

942
01:16:15.445 --> 01:16:17.197
What the fuck?

943
01:16:17.989 --> 01:16:19.532
I don't know. Why?

944
01:16:19.699 --> 01:16:22.534
Because his dick
was stuck in a chicken.

945
01:16:31.002 --> 01:16:32.002
Fur ball?

946
01:16:32.171 --> 01:16:33.337
Yeah.

947
01:16:33.506 --> 01:16:37.676
Furry Tom thinks this is probably the first
pussy a lot of you have seen in a long time.

948
01:16:37.842 --> 01:16:39.927
Especially this fat fuck over here.

949
01:16:40.095 --> 01:16:42.639
Where'd you get the suit, Grandpa?
Gangsters "R" Us?

950
01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:50.814
- Go, get out of here!
- Come on!

951
01:17:08.666 --> 01:17:12.543
- What the hell is she doing here?
- I followed him. It's not his fault.

952
01:17:13.045 --> 01:17:17.047
- Goddamn it, I'm gonna kill you both.
- Well, you're gonna have to stand in line.

953
01:17:23.389 --> 01:17:25.597
- Here, take this.
- What am I gonna do with this?

954
01:17:25.765 --> 01:17:27.850
Point it at the bad guys and shoot!

955
01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:33.605
Get your head down. Get down!

956
01:17:34.899 --> 01:17:36.234
Dad!

957
01:17:39.654 --> 01:17:42.532
- Got any more bright ideas?
- Yeah, we're gonna go really fast.

958
01:17:42.699 --> 01:17:44.242
Good idea.

959
01:17:53.252 --> 01:17:55.962
Push this vile fuck off the road, man!

960
01:17:59.050 --> 01:18:00.341
Hang on.

961
01:18:07.975 --> 01:18:09.600
Put your seat belts on!

962
01:18:09.769 --> 01:18:11.101
Yo, yo, this is bad.

963
01:18:13.271 --> 01:18:16.024
- Hang on.
- This is very, very bad!

964
01:18:30.622 --> 01:18:32.457
Are you all right? Let's go. Come on.

965
01:18:34.710 --> 01:18:36.461
Shit.

966
01:18:58.109 --> 01:18:59.484
Shit.

967
01:19:00.277 --> 01:19:02.987
Is there any chance these guys
are still alive in there?

968
01:19:04.782 --> 01:19:06.198
Not now.

969
01:19:06.699 --> 01:19:07.699
Hey, call the cops.

970
01:19:08.034 --> 01:19:12.663
There's a bomb on the way to the Coliseum.
Senator Baynard's in danger! You got it?

971
01:19:15.708 --> 01:19:19.002
Here. Happy birthday.
Buy yourself a new pair of pants.

972
01:19:19.171 --> 01:19:22.340
We gotta get that bomb before
it gets to Baynard. Got a car here?

973
01:19:22.966 --> 01:19:24.676
- Hey. You got a car?
- Yeah.

974
01:19:24.844 --> 01:19:26.636
- Give me the keys.
- No way.

975
01:19:26.970 --> 01:19:29.514
- Give me the keys or I shoot the kid.
- Daddy.

976
01:19:29.681 --> 01:19:30.974
Shh.

977
01:19:33.685 --> 01:19:34.685
Okay. All right.

978
01:19:35.186 --> 01:19:36.895
Are you all right? Let's go. Come on.

979
01:19:38.731 --> 01:19:41.275
- You must be the dumbest guy in the world.
- Why's that?

980
01:19:41.444 --> 01:19:44.028
You're trying to save the guy
that ruined your career...

981
01:19:44.195 --> 01:19:47.157
and avenge the death of the guy
that fucked your wife.

982
01:19:47.533 --> 01:19:50.159
The little girl said her dad's name
is Joe Hollenbrooker.

983
01:19:50.327 --> 01:19:52.078
- What is it? Hallenbeck.
- Hallenbeck.

984
01:19:52.246 --> 01:19:55.247
He stole my car and said
he's going to the Coliseum.

985
01:19:58.127 --> 01:20:01.962
He stole my car. He set my pool on fire.
The man is a lunatic. Ah!

986
01:20:07.261 --> 01:20:10.805
Give me 10 black-and-whites.
Hallenbeck is on his way to the Coliseum.

987
01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:22.358
Joe, if we go any faster,
we're gonna travel back in time.

988
01:20:26.238 --> 01:20:27.988
There, middle lane.

989
01:20:28.740 --> 01:20:31.618
- Okay. You pull up and I yell at them.
- What?

990
01:20:31.784 --> 01:20:35.454
- Pull up next to them, I'll yell at them.
- That's the lamest plan I ever heard!

991
01:20:35.622 --> 01:20:39.751
- Can we try it?
- Bulletproof glass. They won't hear you.

992
01:20:42.421 --> 01:20:44.463
- What are you doing?
- Drawing them a picture.

993
01:20:44.631 --> 01:20:45.923
- What is that?
- A bomb.

994
01:20:46.091 --> 01:20:50.929
Looks like an apple with lines. They'll say,
"Don't open the briefcase, it's full of fruit."

995
01:20:51.095 --> 01:20:52.596
You wanna draw the damn thing?

996
01:21:03.484 --> 01:21:04.484
Happy?

997
01:21:06.194 --> 01:21:07.612
Are you kidding me?

998
01:21:10.949 --> 01:21:13.451
Always criticizing my shit.
I can't do nothing right.

999
01:21:14.203 --> 01:21:15.828
Oh, shit.

1000
01:21:18.457 --> 01:21:19.707
I forgot to tell you.

1001
01:21:19.875 --> 01:21:23.752
- "Bom" means "Fuck you" in Polish.
- That's not funny, man. I almost bought it.

1002
01:21:23.921 --> 01:21:26.588
Tragic loss to the art world,
let me tell you.

1003
01:21:27.048 --> 01:21:29.841
- You're gonna lose them, man.
- Buckle your fucking seat belt.

1004
01:21:30.010 --> 01:21:31.386
It's not working!

1005
01:21:38.226 --> 01:21:39.644
Oh! Oh, shit.

1006
01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:49.279
I swear to Christ, if I survive
this fucking case, I'm gonna dance a jig.

1007
01:21:49.488 --> 01:21:50.488
What?

1008
01:21:50.655 --> 01:21:53.865
- I'm gonna dance a jig, I swear to Christ.
- There! There!

1009
01:21:54.033 --> 01:21:56.493
The off-ramp we just passed!

1010
01:21:59.872 --> 01:22:01.498
Oh...

1011
01:22:03.752 --> 01:22:07.505
Hey, where you going?
Hey, man, what the hell are you doing?

1012
01:22:45.793 --> 01:22:47.420
Jesus Christ.

1013
01:22:47.837 --> 01:22:48.880
Ain't I a bitch?

1014
01:22:49.797 --> 01:22:52.425
- So now do we go to the cops?
- I'll think about it.

1015
01:23:02.144 --> 01:23:03.226
You expecting a call?

1016
01:23:06.356 --> 01:23:08.649
- Yeah.
- Hey, motherfucker.

1017
01:23:08.817 --> 01:23:11.819
Hey, Milo. Where you calling from,
the bottom of the pool?

1018
01:23:11.987 --> 01:23:13.779
I'm on my way to the ball game.

1019
01:23:14.364 --> 01:23:16.908
Hey, Joe, listen.
Someone here wants to talk to you.

1020
01:23:17.909 --> 01:23:19.327
Hi, Daddy.

1021
01:23:20.078 --> 01:23:24.623
I'm okay. I'm not hurt. Dad?

1022
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.458
You back off, Joseph...

1023
01:23:26.627 --> 01:23:29.337
or I'm gonna show your daughter
what a hot date I am.

1024
01:23:33.425 --> 01:23:36.051
- What happened? What's up?
- He's taken Darian.

1025
01:23:37.470 --> 01:23:38.887
What do we do?

1026
01:23:39.430 --> 01:23:40.765
We take Marcone.

1027
01:23:41.225 --> 01:23:44.018
It's the only way. If we do nothing,
they'll kill her anyway.

1028
01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:47.438
Careful with that case.
It's the one that goes "bang."

1029
01:23:48.774 --> 01:23:49.981
Look at all this.

1030
01:23:50.609 --> 01:23:51.900
Yeah.

1031
01:23:52.610 --> 01:23:54.028
Shredders.

1032
01:23:54.195 --> 01:23:58.448
The police and DEA use these
to blow locks. Explode on impact.

1033
01:23:58.617 --> 01:24:00.993
Kill everything within a 10-foot radius.

1034
01:24:01.161 --> 01:24:02.412
- Shredders, huh?
- Yeah.

1035
01:24:02.578 --> 01:24:05.622
Put this on. Get in. You in or you out?

1036
01:24:05.832 --> 01:24:08.333
- I guess I'm in. What have I got to lose?
- Son...

1037
01:24:08.502 --> 01:24:10.086
we're going to a ball game.

1038
01:24:27.311 --> 01:24:29.396
Hey, that's Marcone's car.

1039
01:24:29.564 --> 01:24:31.064
Come on.

1040
01:24:31.483 --> 01:24:34.234
- I always wanted to do that.
- You should've shit on it.

1041
01:24:46.998 --> 01:24:48.248
- Shit.
- What?

1042
01:24:48.417 --> 01:24:51.042
I forgot to tell you,
you're wanted for murder.

1043
01:24:55.548 --> 01:24:57.550
Hey, Mr. Dix, long time no see.

1044
01:24:57.717 --> 01:24:59.385
Yeah, too long.

1045
01:24:59.552 --> 01:25:02.721
- Listen, we're going to see Mr. Marcone.
- Yeah, sure, go ahead.

1046
01:25:13.692 --> 01:25:15.193
Jimmy Dix, you bastard.

1047
01:25:15.359 --> 01:25:17.694
You broke my nose!
What the fuck you doing here?

1048
01:25:17.863 --> 01:25:20.448
You were banned!
You were kicked off the fucking team!

1049
01:25:20.698 --> 01:25:23.909
How'd you like to get kicked off
the fucking planet?

1050
01:25:24.077 --> 01:25:26.119
Have a nice game.

1051
01:25:45.349 --> 01:25:47.390
Hi, Joe.

1052
01:25:47.935 --> 01:25:49.519
How you doing?

1053
01:25:49.685 --> 01:25:52.979
You are one dumb son of a bitch.

1054
01:25:53.481 --> 01:25:57.025
- Did you know that?
- I guess we ain't gonna be dancing that jig.

1055
01:26:00.029 --> 01:26:03.114
- You okay, Darian?
- Why, of course she's all right.

1056
01:26:03.283 --> 01:26:06.243
- She's been with her Uncle Shelly.
- Yeah, I'm okay, Dad.

1057
01:26:07.078 --> 01:26:10.706
Come on, fellas, lose the guns.
Take off your coats. Relax.

1058
01:26:10.873 --> 01:26:15.086
Give it up. What do you think Baynard will
do when he finds out you tried to kill him?

1059
01:26:15.253 --> 01:26:16.878
Son, he doesn't have a chance.

1060
01:26:17.421 --> 01:26:19.715
Very shortly, my old buddy Milo
will have him...

1061
01:26:19.882 --> 01:26:22.592
between the crosshairs
of a high-powered rifle.

1062
01:26:22.886 --> 01:26:24.679
Where's old Milo shooting from?

1063
01:26:26.097 --> 01:26:29.140
You just don't ever run out
of questions, do you?

1064
01:26:29.309 --> 01:26:34.145
Well, let's just say that
Milo's in a highly enlightened position.

1065
01:26:34.605 --> 01:26:35.898
Why'd you kill Cory?

1066
01:26:37.943 --> 01:26:40.610
She took to blackmail, Jim.
I have no truck with that.

1067
01:26:41.238 --> 01:26:43.948
Why, she's one of the sweetest
little whores I ever tasted.

1068
01:26:44.658 --> 01:26:47.326
There's 5 feet of marble
between me and you.

1069
01:26:47.493 --> 01:26:49.787
Maybe I make it, maybe I don't.

1070
01:26:49.954 --> 01:26:52.832
You call her "whore" again,
I'm gonna find out.

1071
01:26:54.126 --> 01:26:57.545
Jimmy, Jimmy. Do what you gotta do.

1072
01:26:57.712 --> 01:26:59.630
Take it easy, Jimmy.

1073
01:27:00.215 --> 01:27:01.591
He should know.

1074
01:27:01.757 --> 01:27:04.260
With a face like that,
he's gotta be paying for it.

1075
01:27:04.427 --> 01:27:07.430
If you're fond of this little girl...

1076
01:27:07.722 --> 01:27:09.806
you'll keep your goddamn mouth shut.

1077
01:27:09.975 --> 01:27:11.641
Eat shit, you fucking redneck!

1078
01:27:12.351 --> 01:27:14.020
Come here, Darian.

1079
01:27:15.146 --> 01:27:18.189
Goddamn, I'm really glad
to see you, Jimmy.

1080
01:27:18.358 --> 01:27:23.404
You know, I've still got that autographed
ball you gave me for my collection.

1081
01:27:23.572 --> 01:27:26.865
Yep. It's a shame about you.

1082
01:27:27.033 --> 01:27:29.201
You had the million-dollar arm, kiddo.

1083
01:27:29.368 --> 01:27:31.662
Yeah, you got hooked on...

1084
01:27:31.829 --> 01:27:34.332
Was it Demerol?

1085
01:27:35.042 --> 01:27:39.337
Because you couldn't stand the pain.
You hated the pain.

1086
01:27:41.422 --> 01:27:43.841
Couldn't take the pain, Joe.

1087
01:27:44.842 --> 01:27:47.886
- Life is pain, Jim.
- Hey, what the...? Aah!

1088
01:27:48.055 --> 01:27:51.349
- Hey!
- Oh, shit. Oh!

1089
01:27:51.515 --> 01:27:53.225
Walk it off, son.

1090
01:27:53.393 --> 01:27:56.354
- Discipline.
- Oh, God.

1091
01:27:56.939 --> 01:28:01.609
Kids nowadays
just don't have no discipline.

1092
01:28:02.402 --> 01:28:04.153
Now, don't you cry, honey.

1093
01:28:04.738 --> 01:28:06.404
No, no, don't cry.

1094
01:28:06.573 --> 01:28:09.492
Come on, honey.
Come sit in Uncle Shelly's chair.

1095
01:28:09.868 --> 01:28:12.036
- You're gonna be just fine.
- Let the girl go.

1096
01:28:19.002 --> 01:28:20.336
Get them out of my misery.

1097
01:28:21.837 --> 01:28:24.381
There is the matter of the $6 million. Ahem.

1098
01:28:24.966 --> 01:28:27.385
That is, unless you're not interested.

1099
01:28:27.551 --> 01:28:29.052
Let's humor this asshole.

1100
01:28:29.554 --> 01:28:31.346
Tell me about it.

1101
01:28:32.890 --> 01:28:34.891
Just me and Flash here know where it is.

1102
01:28:37.354 --> 01:28:40.021
It's in the back of a white BMW.

1103
01:28:41.149 --> 01:28:42.692
We can take you to it.

1104
01:28:42.859 --> 01:28:45.903
Milo told me the money was destroyed.

1105
01:28:46.697 --> 01:28:48.405
You're bluffing.

1106
01:28:48.739 --> 01:28:50.658
You think I'm bluffing?

1107
01:28:50.826 --> 01:28:53.368
I also have in my possession
a certain tape...

1108
01:28:53.537 --> 01:28:55.829
of you and Senator Baynard.

1109
01:28:55.997 --> 01:28:57.288
Very juicy stuff.

1110
01:28:57.457 --> 01:29:00.208
Well, now, just let me guess.

1111
01:29:00.585 --> 01:29:03.045
If something happens to you...

1112
01:29:03.212 --> 01:29:05.922
that damn thing's gonna be
mailed to the cops, isn't it?

1113
01:29:06.173 --> 01:29:08.717
Close. Actually, it goes to the Mob.

1114
01:29:10.386 --> 01:29:13.847
I'm sure they'd be very interested
in hearing what you're up to.

1115
01:29:14.056 --> 01:29:16.434
Legalized gambling.

1116
01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:18.935
Hell, they stand to lose, what, two...

1117
01:29:19.104 --> 01:29:21.479
two and a half billion dollars?

1118
01:29:21.648 --> 01:29:26.944
I'm sure they won't be upset about that.
It's just their entire bookmaking income.

1119
01:29:27.112 --> 01:29:30.573
So you go ahead and pull the trigger.
Be my guest.

1120
01:29:30.740 --> 01:29:35.618
Just don't be surprised if you wake up
with a stallion head next to you, babe.

1121
01:29:42.252 --> 01:29:46.588
If you had that goddamn tape,
you'd have already told me.

1122
01:29:48.341 --> 01:29:49.632
This ain't working, man.

1123
01:29:49.801 --> 01:29:52.136
Try something else. Take your best shot.

1124
01:29:52.970 --> 01:29:56.097
Fuck you, Joe, I ain't going out like that!
Mr. Marcone, he's lying.

1125
01:29:56.265 --> 01:29:59.393
- We have the money, but it's not in the car.
- Shut the fuck up!

1126
01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:03.773
- It's in a locker! And I got the key.
- Where is the key, Jim?

1127
01:30:04.815 --> 01:30:06.233
I got it stashed in my shorts.

1128
01:30:07.610 --> 01:30:09.444
Easy. Just easy.

1129
01:30:11.655 --> 01:30:15.283
- Give him that key, he'll kill you.
- He's gonna kill us anyway, asshole.

1130
01:30:19.163 --> 01:30:22.625
- You gotta promise to let me go.
- Bullshit.

1131
01:30:22.917 --> 01:30:25.627
Give him the key
or I'll have you kneecapped.

1132
01:30:26.587 --> 01:30:28.213
Whoops.

1133
01:30:29.298 --> 01:30:32.676
Look like nobody gets the money.
That's one of those new plastic keys.

1134
01:30:32.844 --> 01:30:35.470
- Get the goddamned key!
- The kind that shred.

1135
01:30:35.639 --> 01:30:37.180
Darian, get down!

1136
01:30:43.020 --> 01:30:45.523
Get her out! Get her out! Go, go!

1137
01:30:46.190 --> 01:30:47.483
Go!

1138
01:30:58.494 --> 01:30:59.537
Now, now!

1139
01:31:05.836 --> 01:31:09.046
- I can't walk.
- You all right? You gonna pass out?

1140
01:31:09.213 --> 01:31:11.256
I'm gonna make it, man.

1141
01:31:13.217 --> 01:31:16.177
Wrap this around your hand.
Plastic keys, the kind that shred?

1142
01:31:16.345 --> 01:31:18.180
It was short notice. Best I could do.

1143
01:31:18.347 --> 01:31:20.431
You did good, junior. Real good.

1144
01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:22.225
Yeah, I learned it from a pro.

1145
01:31:26.189 --> 01:31:28.106
Shit, Joe. You wasn't bluffing.

1146
01:31:43.914 --> 01:31:47.417
- Where's the senator's box, Jimmy?
- Section C. Come on, I'll show you.

1147
01:31:50.337 --> 01:31:52.797
- Where's the senator's box?
- There.

1148
01:31:55.844 --> 01:31:57.761
Where's Milo?

1149
01:32:01.224 --> 01:32:02.600
Shit.

1150
01:32:04.935 --> 01:32:07.395
A highly enlightened position.

1151
01:32:08.439 --> 01:32:10.815
He's gotta be up on those lights
up there. Listen.

1152
01:32:10.984 --> 01:32:13.610
- Go find a cop and you stay put, all right?
- No.

1153
01:32:13.778 --> 01:32:16.905
You hear me? Listen to me.
Listen to Daddy, all right?

1154
01:32:17.073 --> 01:32:20.909
I'm gonna be all right. Now, you do
what I say. All right, give me a kiss.

1155
01:32:21.077 --> 01:32:23.037
Go, go. Run now. Go find a cop.

1156
01:32:23.246 --> 01:32:24.954
- What about me?
- You find Baynard.

1157
01:32:25.372 --> 01:32:28.000
- Then what do I do?
- Get his attention.

1158
01:32:28.167 --> 01:32:29.167
Yeah.

1159
01:32:29.336 --> 01:32:32.755
Thirty-three! Hut! Hut!

1160
01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:38.426
Come on, push it, you fat bastard.

1161
01:32:38.636 --> 01:32:39.636
Freeze, Hallenbeck.

1162
01:32:39.804 --> 01:32:42.305
- There's a sniper on that light!
- You're under arrest.

1163
01:32:42.474 --> 01:32:44.891
- He's gonna shoot Baynard!
- Come on.

1164
01:33:12.753 --> 01:33:14.837
There he is. That's Jimmy Dix.

1165
01:33:15.006 --> 01:33:18.676
Come on, get this fuck.
He pulled a fucking gun on me. You scum!

1166
01:33:21.304 --> 01:33:25.056
He's got a shotgun!
You bastard! You fuck!

1167
01:33:39.405 --> 01:33:41.073
Sit down, you fuck!

1168
01:33:44.411 --> 01:33:48.329
permitted on the
playing field. Please remain in your seat.

1169
01:33:48.497 --> 01:33:52.083
Again, I repeat.
Please remain in your seat.

1170
01:33:52.252 --> 01:33:53.877
- Give me the ball.
- Jimmy?

1171
01:33:54.087 --> 01:33:57.131
Give me the fucking ball! Thank you.

1172
01:33:57.298 --> 01:33:59.216
I'll find you, you son of a bitch.

1173
01:34:02.804 --> 01:34:06.097
No one is permitted on the playing field.

1174
01:34:10.060 --> 01:34:12.061
I said, sit down!

1175
01:34:21.948 --> 01:34:23.448
- Fuck!
- Aah!

1176
01:34:43.761 --> 01:34:46.680
- You fucking asshole.
- No.

1177
01:34:59.444 --> 01:35:01.612
Put down your weapon.
You're under arrest.

1178
01:35:12.539 --> 01:35:13.832
Fuck!

1179
01:35:16.668 --> 01:35:17.795
Looking for this?

1180
01:35:21.006 --> 01:35:22.757
You fucking asshole.

1181
01:35:26.970 --> 01:35:28.012
Aah!

1182
01:35:36.064 --> 01:35:37.523
I told you...

1183
01:35:37.689 --> 01:35:40.359
if you ever touch me again, I'll kill you.

1184
01:35:44.363 --> 01:35:45.905
Not me! Not me!

1185
01:36:15.686 --> 01:36:17.520
Hey, what the hell is he doing?

1186
01:36:17.689 --> 01:36:20.023
I don't know. Is he dancing?

1187
01:36:22.694 --> 01:36:24.778
It looks like... It looks like he's dancing.

1188
01:36:28.533 --> 01:36:31.993
You know, for a dancer,
he's one hell of a detective.

1189
01:36:42.046 --> 01:36:46.382
So, what's this I hear about Satan Claus?

1190
01:36:46.551 --> 01:36:47.967
Oh.

1191
01:36:48.136 --> 01:36:50.720
- You know about him too?
- There, that's the man.

1192
01:36:50.889 --> 01:36:54.224
There's the bastard who's been making
the phone calls and harassing me!

1193
01:36:54.391 --> 01:36:57.603
I bet he stage-managed
the whole damn thing.

1194
01:36:58.729 --> 01:37:00.564
Arrest him!

1195
01:37:06.570 --> 01:37:07.779
Head or gut?

1196
01:37:08.698 --> 01:37:09.739
Excuse me?

1197
01:37:11.201 --> 01:37:12.408
Move, move.

1198
01:37:17.414 --> 01:37:18.414
Mom's here.

1199
01:37:18.582 --> 01:37:20.417
- Oh.
- Mom.

1200
01:37:20.585 --> 01:37:22.085
Oh, I missed you so much.

1201
01:37:25.965 --> 01:37:28.257
Yeah, you're a real bastard,
you know that, Joe?

1202
01:37:29.886 --> 01:37:31.886
And then some.

1203
01:37:33.555 --> 01:37:35.599
I'm so glad you're here.
I was so worried.

1204
01:37:54.618 --> 01:37:56.787
I'm sorry.

1205
01:38:01.333 --> 01:38:04.127
I'm so sorry.

1206
01:38:07.465 --> 01:38:09.341
Please forgive me.

1207
01:38:18.810 --> 01:38:21.144
I'll buy a dog.

1208
01:38:33.448 --> 01:38:35.658
Fuck you, Sarah.

1209
01:38:52.385 --> 01:38:54.720
Fuck you, Sarah.

1210
01:38:55.179 --> 01:38:59.224
You're a lying bitch and if the cops
weren't here, I'd spit in your face.

1211
01:39:09.610 --> 01:39:13.070
Joe, where's the briefcase
they were telling me about?

1212
01:39:14.114 --> 01:39:16.574
White BMW, back seat.

1213
01:39:23.041 --> 01:39:24.541
Ain't a thing here.

1214
01:39:33.717 --> 01:39:35.051
Bingo.

1215
01:39:41.850 --> 01:39:44.394
Marcone's got the wrong one.

1216
01:40:05.291 --> 01:40:06.582
What?

1217
01:40:13.466 --> 01:40:15.216
So, what's next for us?

1218
01:40:15.426 --> 01:40:16.967
- Okay, go.
- Okay, ready?

1219
01:40:17.136 --> 01:40:19.429
- Tomorrow, I guess.
- Okay, okay. Hut.

1220
01:40:19.596 --> 01:40:21.931
- We'll just take it one step at a time.
- Why?

1221
01:40:23.893 --> 01:40:27.186
Dad, can I go show Jimmy
to my friends?

1222
01:40:27.354 --> 01:40:30.106
- He's not a puppy, honey.
- Come on, he's fucking famous.

1223
01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:32.900
Hey. You wanna watch your mouth?

1224
01:40:33.069 --> 01:40:34.110
Come on, Dad.

1225
01:40:34.278 --> 01:40:38.114
Darian. Your father said,
"Watch your mouth." Now, do it.

1226
01:40:41.868 --> 01:40:43.412
Yes, sir.

1227
01:40:44.747 --> 01:40:46.163
I like that.

1228
01:40:50.293 --> 01:40:53.296
So I'm thinking I could use a partner.

1229
01:40:53.463 --> 01:40:55.172
You up for that?

1230
01:40:55.341 --> 01:40:57.634
I don't know anything
about being a detective.

1231
01:40:57.801 --> 01:40:59.344
There's nothing to it.

1232
01:40:59.511 --> 01:41:03.180
This being the '90s, you can't just walk up
to a guy and smack him in the face.

1233
01:41:03.349 --> 01:41:05.891
- You gotta say something cool first.
- Yeah, like...

1234
01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:07.685
"I'll be back."

1235
01:41:07.854 --> 01:41:11.064
Yeah, only better than that. Like,
you hit him with a surfboard, you say...

1236
01:41:11.231 --> 01:41:12.399
"Surf's up, pal."

1237
01:41:12.567 --> 01:41:14.734
Yeah, something like that.

1238
01:41:14.902 --> 01:41:15.944
So, what else?

1239
01:41:16.112 --> 01:41:18.320
There's not much more to tell than that.

1240
01:41:18.488 --> 01:41:20.573
Water's wet, the sky is blue...

1241
01:41:20.742 --> 01:41:24.828
and old Satan Claus, Jimmy, he's
out there and he's just getting stronger.

1242
01:41:24.996 --> 01:41:28.497
- So, what do we do about that?
- Be prepared, son.

1243
01:41:28.666 --> 01:41:31.376
That's my motto. Be prepared.
