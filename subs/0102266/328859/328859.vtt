00:03:03.228 --> 00:03:04.718
Green 88!

2
00:03:06.098 --> 00:03:07.258
Set!

3
00:03:07.365 --> 00:03:08.457
Hut!

4
00:03:18.977 --> 00:03:21.138
That ends the first half of play...

5
00:03:21.346 --> 00:03:23.610
...with the score: Cleveland, 17...

6
00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:25.382
...Los Angeles, 10.

7
00:03:27.486 --> 00:03:29.181
Let's go! Move!

8
00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:36.354
Billy Cole!

9
00:03:37.262 --> 00:03:38.923
The first half stunk!

10
00:03:38.997 --> 00:03:42.489
Open up the holes! Get in there like pigs!

11
00:03:42.768 --> 00:03:44.133
Billy Cole.

12
00:03:44.202 --> 00:03:46.102
Got a call on Line 3.

13
00:03:46.171 --> 00:03:48.002
Let's kick some butt!

14
00:03:48.173 --> 00:03:50.300
Let's get out of this town as winners!

15
00:03:50.375 --> 00:03:51.467
l hate Cleveland!

16
00:03:57.115 --> 00:03:59.208
Hello, William. This is Milo.

17
00:03:59.684 --> 00:04:01.948
There's a lot of money on this game.

18
00:04:05.123 --> 00:04:07.785
You better start scoring
some touchdowns, William.

19
00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:10.623
Do whatever it takes. Understood?

20
00:04:10.896 --> 00:04:13.296
Or else you're history.

21
00:04:16.234 --> 00:04:19.499
Welcome back to the second half.
We're in Cleveland...

22
00:04:19.571 --> 00:04:23.507
...the site of tonight's game between
the L.A. Stallions and the Cleveland Cats.

23
00:04:23.575 --> 00:04:25.975
l'm Vern Lundquist.
along with Dick Butkus.

24
00:04:26.044 --> 00:04:29.309
And yes. friends. it really is that wet.

25
00:04:30.015 --> 00:04:33.473
Vern. even though
the Stallions trail 1 7 to 10...

26
00:04:33.618 --> 00:04:35.142
...there walks a happy man--

27
00:04:35.253 --> 00:04:37.949
Sheldon Marcone,
owner of the L.A. Stallions.

28
00:04:38.023 --> 00:04:40.890
His team sits atop the Western Division
at 6 and 2.

29
00:04:40.992 --> 00:04:44.086
-Sheldon is standing by with Lynn Swann.
-Let's go to them.

30
00:04:44.496 --> 00:04:46.464
49.256.

31
00:04:46.531 --> 00:04:50.194
Pretty poor attendance even for a night
like this. wouldn't you say?

32
00:04:50.368 --> 00:04:51.699
l wouldn't say.

33
00:04:51.803 --> 00:04:55.398
Can you explain the drop-off
in attendance and TV ratings?

34
00:04:55.473 --> 00:04:57.464
ls this the death of professional football?

35
00:04:57.542 --> 00:05:00.773
No. l think that we're witnessing
the death of good journalism.

36
00:05:20.265 --> 00:05:23.166
Mr. Marcone. are there any heroes
left in this game?

37
00:05:23.235 --> 00:05:26.864
What game are you watching?
Let's talk about heroes.

38
00:05:27.005 --> 00:05:30.702
Billy Cole is having
the game of his life tonight.

39
00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.098
First and ten on the Cleveland 47-yard line.

40
00:06:08.446 --> 00:06:10.539
First and ten,
less than two minutes remaining.

41
00:06:10.615 --> 00:06:13.448
This is probably L.A.'s final possession.

42
00:06:13.518 --> 00:06:16.351
The Stallions need 7.
A field goal will not do.

43
00:06:16.421 --> 00:06:20.517
They need to get the ball to Billy Cole.

44
00:06:43.381 --> 00:06:46.373
The pass is complete to Billy Cole.

45
00:07:20.852 --> 00:07:22.615
Ain't life a bitch?

46
00:07:52.717 --> 00:07:54.116
Dude's trashed.

47
00:07:54.219 --> 00:07:56.710
Shit. We should do something to him.

48
00:08:08.666 --> 00:08:10.065
Do it.

49
00:08:29.287 --> 00:08:31.755
This dude is really trashed.

50
00:08:33.425 --> 00:08:35.620
Go on. Take his watch.

51
00:08:40.365 --> 00:08:42.060
He's got a gun!

52
00:09:13.832 --> 00:09:17.632
This is Hallenbeck Investigations.
Leave your message at the beep.

53
00:09:20.572 --> 00:09:23.200
Mike Matthews. I got a job for you.

54
00:09:23.675 --> 00:09:25.540
Hold on a minute.

55
00:09:27.112 --> 00:09:28.511
l thought you were still in Las Vegas.

56
00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.673
I was going to leave a message.

57
00:09:31.416 --> 00:09:33.316
Terrific. What'd you do last night?

58
00:09:33.485 --> 00:09:36.613
l think l fucked a squirrel to death
and don't remember.

59
00:09:37.789 --> 00:09:39.450
Are you still taking charity?

60
00:09:39.524 --> 00:09:42.960
-What do you got?
-Stripper. Excuse me, exotic dancer.

61
00:09:43.061 --> 00:09:46.030
She's got some weirdo hassling her
and I'm booked solid.

62
00:09:46.097 --> 00:09:47.086
She's hot.

63
00:09:47.165 --> 00:09:49.326
Rates three on my finger scale.

64
00:09:49.667 --> 00:09:53.228
That means I'd cut off three fingers
if God would let me fuck her.

65
00:09:53.705 --> 00:09:56.173
Make her a one on your nose scale.

66
00:09:56.307 --> 00:09:57.296
lmprove your looks.

67
00:09:57.375 --> 00:09:59.206
Yeah. eat me.

68
00:09:59.477 --> 00:10:01.342
l'm booked. You got plans?

69
00:10:01.412 --> 00:10:03.710
l'm thinking about
smoking some cigarettes.

70
00:10:03.781 --> 00:10:05.646
Could you postpone?

71
00:10:06.117 --> 00:10:07.812
These are pretty good cigarettes.

72
00:10:07.886 --> 00:10:09.547
lt's 500 bucks.

73
00:10:10.355 --> 00:10:12.346
l got to run some errands.

74
00:10:12.824 --> 00:10:14.291
Meet you at your office in an hour.

75
00:10:14.359 --> 00:10:17.089
Terrific. Comb your hair.
I'll lend you a nice jacket.

76
00:10:38.716 --> 00:10:40.513
Nobody likes you.

77
00:10:41.052 --> 00:10:42.917
Everybody hates you.

78
00:10:44.022 --> 00:10:45.887
You're going to lose.

79
00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:50.721
Smile. you fuck.

80
00:11:25.763 --> 00:11:27.162
Jimmy?

81
00:11:28.066 --> 00:11:29.499
You still here?

82
00:11:30.201 --> 00:11:31.725
l guess l am.

83
00:11:35.873 --> 00:11:37.534
Help me!

84
00:11:42.714 --> 00:11:43.738
Yo. Ray.

85
00:11:43.848 --> 00:11:47.181
-What's with the girl. man?
-Bitch won't blow me.

86
00:11:47.385 --> 00:11:49.945
lt's too early for that shit. Let her go.

87
00:11:50.021 --> 00:11:52.854
She ain't coming up till she starts blowing.

88
00:11:53.791 --> 00:11:55.759
She's gonna drown.

89
00:11:56.227 --> 00:11:57.319
Fuck you. loser!

90
00:11:57.395 --> 00:11:58.293
Let her go.

91
00:11:58.363 --> 00:12:00.627
What are you doing here anyway?
This is the League Party.

92
00:12:00.698 --> 00:12:03.394
You got kicked out. remember?

93
00:12:07.905 --> 00:12:09.031
Bastard!

94
00:12:10.308 --> 00:12:12.299
-Come on. get out of here.
-Pig!

95
00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:14.275
You fuckhead!

96
00:12:16.814 --> 00:12:20.773
Best arm in the National League.
Remember that. you fat son of a bitch.

97
00:12:35.533 --> 00:12:37.296
l thought you were in Las Vegas.

98
00:12:38.136 --> 00:12:39.364
l was.

99
00:12:41.105 --> 00:12:42.504
Where'd you sleep?

100
00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.301
ln the office.

101
00:12:47.812 --> 00:12:49.803
Hey. Furry Tom.

102
00:12:52.417 --> 00:12:53.816
How much did you lose?

103
00:12:53.918 --> 00:12:55.818
l wasn't there to gamble.

104
00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.144
How much?

105
00:12:57.221 --> 00:12:59.086
l was doing a skip-trace.

106
00:13:04.228 --> 00:13:05.718
Fifty bucks.

107
00:13:09.233 --> 00:13:10.757
What is this?

108
00:13:10.835 --> 00:13:11.859
SATAN CLAUS

109
00:13:11.936 --> 00:13:14.666
Darian's classroom holiday picture.
That was hers.

110
00:13:14.739 --> 00:13:17.401
Obviously. her teacher wants to see us.

111
00:13:18.209 --> 00:13:19.574
Where is she?

112
00:13:19.644 --> 00:13:21.373
Up at a friend's.

113
00:13:23.414 --> 00:13:26.178
Boys still giving her
a hard time with her braces?

114
00:13:26.284 --> 00:13:27.444
Are you kidding?

115
00:13:27.518 --> 00:13:30.783
''Metal mouth.'' that's the latest.
Little bastards.

116
00:13:32.223 --> 00:13:34.851
She'll be screwing them
by the time she's 14.

117
00:13:34.992 --> 00:13:36.584
Watch your goddamn mouth.

118
00:13:36.961 --> 00:13:39.589
You let her wear so much make-up
she looks like...

119
00:13:39.731 --> 00:13:41.631
...a goddamn raccoon.

120
00:13:41.766 --> 00:13:45.293
l come home and think it's a burglar.
l almost shot her twice.

121
00:13:46.904 --> 00:13:49.372
You're not funny.
All the girls wear make-up.

122
00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:53.206
l'm sure they don't put it on
with a paint sprayer.

123
00:13:53.711 --> 00:13:55.576
For your information...

124
00:13:56.247 --> 00:13:59.512
-...a lot of people think l'm very funny.
-Go live with them.

125
00:13:59.817 --> 00:14:01.580
Don't tempt me.

126
00:14:23.908 --> 00:14:25.307
Who's the guy in the closet?

127
00:14:27.278 --> 00:14:28.506
Excuse me?

128
00:14:28.813 --> 00:14:31.247
Sometimes you forget l'm a detective.

129
00:14:33.284 --> 00:14:36.185
All this steam in the shower.
like somebody was just in there.

130
00:14:36.521 --> 00:14:40.514
Your hair is dry. So it must be
somebody else we're talking about.

131
00:14:40.925 --> 00:14:43.359
A male somebody.
'cause the toilet seat's up.

132
00:14:43.828 --> 00:14:46.228
Since he's not under the bed.
you must've stuck him in the closet...

133
00:14:46.297 --> 00:14:49.130
...when you heard my key hit the lock
a day early.

134
00:14:52.336 --> 00:14:54.065
Who's the guy in the closet?

135
00:14:54.172 --> 00:14:56.766
Jesus Christ. nothing changes.

136
00:14:58.643 --> 00:15:00.372
You're still a lunatic.

137
00:15:01.012 --> 00:15:02.639
Gonna tell me who it is?

138
00:15:04.749 --> 00:15:06.307
You want me to open the closet?

139
00:15:06.384 --> 00:15:09.979
l'll do it and then we'll both know
that you're a fucking psycho!

140
00:15:10.054 --> 00:15:12.045
ls that what you want?

141
00:15:13.558 --> 00:15:14.752
Thank you.

142
00:15:15.193 --> 00:15:16.854
That door stays shut.

143
00:15:18.496 --> 00:15:21.795
What l'm going to do is count to three.

144
00:15:22.767 --> 00:15:24.962
Then l'll put a bullet in that door.

145
00:15:26.537 --> 00:15:29.404
You can stop me any time
by telling the truth.

146
00:15:31.242 --> 00:15:34.973
Call your shrink and tell him
you're fucking losing it.

147
00:15:35.046 --> 00:15:37.344
The truth is a beautiful thing.

148
00:15:38.316 --> 00:15:40.750
How dare you come into this house and--

149
00:15:40.818 --> 00:15:41.716
Three.

150
00:15:50.461 --> 00:15:51.951
Keeping her warm for me?

151
00:15:52.063 --> 00:15:54.429
Easy. Don't do nothing dumb.

152
00:15:54.599 --> 00:15:55.998
How was she?

153
00:15:57.268 --> 00:15:59.498
On your finger scale. how was my wife?

154
00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.566
lt just happened.

155
00:16:03.674 --> 00:16:05.232
Sure. l know.

156
00:16:06.544 --> 00:16:08.205
lt just happened.

157
00:16:09.146 --> 00:16:10.841
lt could happen to anybody.

158
00:16:11.682 --> 00:16:13.240
lt was an accident. right?

159
00:16:13.317 --> 00:16:14.750
You tripped...

160
00:16:14.852 --> 00:16:18.288
...slipped on the floor and
accidentally stuck your dick in my wife.

161
00:16:19.891 --> 00:16:23.349
''l'm so sorry. Mrs. H.
This just isn't my week.''

162
00:16:27.365 --> 00:16:29.526
Put the gun down. please.

163
00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.465
Oh. yeah. the gun.

164
00:16:34.038 --> 00:16:35.471
You're right.

165
00:16:39.277 --> 00:16:41.142
l think l am losing it.

166
00:16:51.722 --> 00:16:53.155
Head or gut. Mike?

167
00:16:53.658 --> 00:16:55.819
Joe. how long have we been friends?

168
00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:58.827
Till you started banging my wife.

169
00:16:59.196 --> 00:17:00.686
Head or gut?

170
00:17:03.701 --> 00:17:04.963
Gut.

171
00:17:09.006 --> 00:17:10.906
Got that address for me?

172
00:17:11.342 --> 00:17:12.900
The surveillance job.

173
00:17:13.477 --> 00:17:16.071
You still want the job?

174
00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:19.176
Five hundred bucks is 500 bucks. Mike.

175
00:17:23.487 --> 00:17:25.011
l guess you're right.

176
00:17:25.723 --> 00:17:27.657
CORY EXOTlC DANCER

177
00:17:27.959 --> 00:17:29.392
Throw a shot into her. too?

178
00:17:44.809 --> 00:17:48.438
Get the fuck out of here.
Go shit in your own yard.

179
00:18:11.335 --> 00:18:12.461
Joe!

180

Over here.

181
00:18:27.852 --> 00:18:29.843
Somebody wired the car.

182
00:18:50.875 --> 00:18:52.934
Who the fuck did this?

183
00:18:53.511 --> 00:18:55.445
Mr. Rogers.

184
00:18:55.913 --> 00:18:57.881
How the hell should l know?

185
00:18:58.883 --> 00:19:00.077
You told the cops--

186
00:19:00.151 --> 00:19:03.450
Told them Mike came to farm out
a surveillance job this morning.

187
00:19:04.188 --> 00:19:05.519
That's all?

188
00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:07.289
You didn't mention....

189
00:19:08.859 --> 00:19:10.850
No. l didn't mention it.

190
00:19:14.331 --> 00:19:16.128
You knew. didn't you?

191
00:19:17.835 --> 00:19:18.824
l suspected.

192
00:19:18.903 --> 00:19:21.394
Goddamn it!
Why didn't you say something?

193
00:19:22.406 --> 00:19:24.067
What do you want me to say?

194
00:19:24.308 --> 00:19:26.208
''Fuck you. Sarah''?

195
00:19:27.678 --> 00:19:29.669
Yeah or anything to get a rise out of you.

196
00:19:29.747 --> 00:19:31.408
How about: ''You're a lying bitch.''

197
00:19:31.482 --> 00:19:34.474
How about: ''lf there weren't cops here
l'd spit in your face.''

198
00:19:34.552 --> 00:19:35.712
You want me to spit on you?

199
00:19:35.786 --> 00:19:38.050
lt would show you have some pride left.

200
00:19:38.122 --> 00:19:39.521
Fresh out. honey.

201
00:19:39.824 --> 00:19:43.783
You know what? Fuck you. Joe.
You were never around. l was lonely!

202
00:19:43.861 --> 00:19:45.488
Buy a dog.

203
00:19:46.797 --> 00:19:50.233
l'm not the one who hates you. Joe.
You're the one who hates you.

204
00:19:50.601 --> 00:19:53.627
And l get to live with myself
24 hours a day.

205
00:20:02.413 --> 00:20:03.937
Alex. the astronaut.

206
00:20:04.548 --> 00:20:06.106
Alex. the astronaut.

207
00:20:06.851 --> 00:20:11.049
Last time l saw you drink straight vodka
was when you had cheated on Cory.

208
00:20:11.455 --> 00:20:13.855
Why don't you pour me another?

209
00:20:14.892 --> 00:20:16.359
You didn't.

210
00:20:16.761 --> 00:20:19.525
You gotta be crazy. partner.
cheating on her.

211
00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:21.798
l gotta be something.

212
00:20:21.899 --> 00:20:26.700
Because nowadays l only lose friends.
drink and nail anything with a heartbeat.

213
00:20:26.904 --> 00:20:29.600
Just stay on that side of the bar.

214
00:20:30.775 --> 00:20:32.367
Oh. Harp.

215
00:20:44.388 --> 00:20:45.548
Should l pay you now?

216
00:20:45.623 --> 00:20:48.421
No. you should not. Put the money away.

217
00:20:48.993 --> 00:20:49.982
Sit down.

218
00:20:59.103 --> 00:21:00.798
You don't think the cops can help you?

219
00:21:00.871 --> 00:21:04.238
Sure. After l'm dead.
they'll perform the autopsy.

220
00:21:04.542 --> 00:21:06.635
l guess you don't want to wait that long.

221
00:21:06.944 --> 00:21:08.309
Guess not.

222
00:21:11.515 --> 00:21:13.779
This is the only music they play
in this joint?

223
00:21:14.018 --> 00:21:15.883
l hate this funk shit.

224
00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:18.451
l'll have to charge you extra.

225
00:21:18.689 --> 00:21:20.054
What'd you expect?

226
00:21:20.858 --> 00:21:22.519
The Four Freshmen.

227
00:21:22.827 --> 00:21:23.816
Pat Boone.

228
00:21:23.894 --> 00:21:26.829
-What are you. my father?
-Yeah. l'm your father.

229
00:21:26.964 --> 00:21:29.592
-Put some clothes on.
-You're hilarious.

230
00:21:31.936 --> 00:21:33.335
Stick your head in that speaker.

231
00:21:33.404 --> 00:21:37.033
You'll be screaming:
''Play that funky music. white boy! ''

232
00:21:38.742 --> 00:21:40.539
The screaming part. l believe.

233
00:21:42.646 --> 00:21:44.011
Hello. handsome.

234
00:21:49.119 --> 00:21:50.848
Who's that stiff over there?

235
00:21:51.956 --> 00:21:53.446
That's nobody.

236
00:21:56.794 --> 00:21:58.853
lt's my turn to dance. Shit.

237
00:22:07.104 --> 00:22:10.631
All right. Let's bring out a woman
who's always in the mood.

238
00:22:10.708 --> 00:22:15.645
Put your hands together
for the lovely and talented Miss Cory!

239
00:22:44.408 --> 00:22:45.602
You're nobody.

240
00:22:46.377 --> 00:22:47.674
Don't tell anyone.

241
00:22:47.778 --> 00:22:50.008
Cory says you're nobody.

242
00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:54.173
Easy. Nobody's raining on your parade.
l'm just keeping an eye on her.

243
00:22:54.251 --> 00:22:56.742
What are you? Some kind of bodyguard?

244
00:22:57.221 --> 00:22:58.950
Yeah. something like that.

245
00:22:59.056 --> 00:23:00.683
Got a match?

246
00:23:02.092 --> 00:23:03.821
ls Cory in trouble?

247
00:23:03.961 --> 00:23:05.519
l don't know. You tell me.

248
00:23:05.629 --> 00:23:07.529
She didn't mention anything to me.

249
00:23:07.998 --> 00:23:09.863
Does that piss you off?

250
00:23:10.501 --> 00:23:12.025
Maybe.

251
00:23:12.369 --> 00:23:14.030
Don't sweat it.

252
00:23:14.138 --> 00:23:15.696
Women have secrets.

253
00:23:19.109 --> 00:23:21.942
Water's wet. The sky is blue.
Women have secrets.

254
00:23:22.179 --> 00:23:23.544
Who gives a fuck?

255
00:23:25.549 --> 00:23:26.948
You want a beer?

256
00:23:28.218 --> 00:23:29.947
So she just hired you?

257
00:23:30.287 --> 00:23:32.016
You're in the book?

258
00:23:33.257 --> 00:23:35.725
She hired my buddy. Mike.
l'm just filling in.

259
00:23:35.826 --> 00:23:37.157
Where's this Mike?

260
00:23:37.294 --> 00:23:38.386
He died.

261
00:23:38.595 --> 00:23:40.290
l'm sorry to hear that.

262
00:23:41.665 --> 00:23:43.030
He was an asshole.

263
00:23:43.867 --> 00:23:47.564
l don't know who the fuck you are
or what's going on. but Cory's my girl.

264
00:23:47.671 --> 00:23:49.969
lf she's in trouble. l want to know about it.

265
00:23:51.008 --> 00:23:52.669
Confidential. big boy.

266
00:23:52.743 --> 00:23:55.075
Why don't you just tell me anyway?

267
00:23:56.313 --> 00:23:57.371
Nope.

268
00:23:59.216 --> 00:24:02.674
Man. you couldn't protect
a cup of warm piss.

269
00:24:06.323 --> 00:24:08.188
Why don't you just hit me?

270
00:24:08.792 --> 00:24:09.952
Excuse me?

271
00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:13.027
Come on. chickenshit.
Bust me in the chops.

272
00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:15.425
You don't think an old guy like me
could hurt you. do you?

273
00:24:17.234 --> 00:24:18.724
You know who l am?

274
00:24:18.802 --> 00:24:23.205
James Alexander Dix. quarterback
for the L.A. Stallions. '89. '90.

275
00:24:23.507 --> 00:24:26.032
Banned from the League
on gambling charges.

276
00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:28.944
Allegations of drug abuse.

277
00:24:29.046 --> 00:24:31.947
Another tragic tale of wasted youth.

278
00:24:32.049 --> 00:24:33.380
Now you're starting to piss me off!

279
00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:35.077
lt's about fucking time.

280
00:24:35.152 --> 00:24:36.585
Joe Hallenbeck.

281
00:24:39.189 --> 00:24:40.383
l'm a private detective.

282
00:24:40.457 --> 00:24:42.118
You're fucking low-life to me.

283
00:24:42.226 --> 00:24:44.524
At least l didn't shit
my talent away on coke.

284
00:24:59.076 --> 00:25:01.044
l spilled my warm cup of piss.

285
00:25:01.111 --> 00:25:04.638
-Cory. let's go. Come on.
-What's the matter with you?

286
00:25:04.882 --> 00:25:07.043
Shut up!
Keep your monkey ass in the cage.

287
00:25:07.251 --> 00:25:08.548
lt's cool.

288
00:25:11.555 --> 00:25:14.046

l didn't vote for you. son of a bitch.

292
00:26:25.462 --> 00:26:27.054
So l'm a low-life.

293
00:26:37.541 --> 00:26:39.509
That's him. He was with her.

294
00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.638
Get him out of here and kill him.

295
00:26:44.715 --> 00:26:46.114
There's no contract on him.

296
00:26:46.183 --> 00:26:48.617
Then you'll do it for free.
Just do it elsewhere.

297
00:26:55.592 --> 00:26:57.753
Alex. the pediatrician.

298
00:26:58.462 --> 00:27:00.453
Alex. the pediatrician.

299
00:27:07.004 --> 00:27:10.098
lf l were a cat. l'd purr.

300
00:27:12.142 --> 00:27:13.609

303
00:27:19.616 --> 00:27:21.311
Does it look like that?

304
00:27:21.385 --> 00:27:22.750
Do you want it?

305
00:27:22.819 --> 00:27:24.343
What is it? Give me a hint.

306
00:27:24.421 --> 00:27:25.718
A hint?

307
00:27:28.592 --> 00:27:31.459
How would you like
to get your old job back?

308
00:27:33.197 --> 00:27:34.892
Go on. Get in there.

309
00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:39.601
Wrong place. wrong time.
Nothing personal.

310
00:27:39.703 --> 00:27:42.831
That's what you think.
Last night l fucked your wife.

311
00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:46.075
You did? How did you know
it was my wife?

312
00:27:46.176 --> 00:27:49.873
She said her husband was a big
pimp-looking motherfucker with a hat.

313
00:27:49.947 --> 00:27:53.212
You're real cool.
for a guy about to take a bullet.

314
00:27:53.417 --> 00:27:55.647
After fucking your wife. l'll take two.

315
00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:02.322
What's this about you
getting me my old job back?

316
00:28:02.392 --> 00:28:04.053
Where the hell is he?

317
00:28:04.161 --> 00:28:05.423
The detective?

318
00:28:05.729 --> 00:28:07.663
What kind of trouble are you in?

319
00:28:07.764 --> 00:28:11.666
Trouble? l'm not in any trouble.
Just some creep threatening me.

320
00:28:11.835 --> 00:28:13.826
Let's go back inside
and wait for Hallenbeck.

321
00:28:13.904 --> 00:28:15.838
What am l? Chopped liver?

322
00:28:15.939 --> 00:28:17.304
Hallenbeck's a bum.

323
00:28:17.374 --> 00:28:19.672
What's he gonna do?
Light a match and breathe on them?

324
00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:22.572
lf this creep shows up. l'll bitch-slap him.

325
00:28:24.081 --> 00:28:26.345
l'll follow you home. Get in your car.

326
00:28:26.583 --> 00:28:28.244
You'll ''bitch-slap'' him?

327
00:28:28.518 --> 00:28:30.247
Yeah. Bitch-slap him.

328
00:28:44.201 --> 00:28:47.261
Now. where you want it?
ln the chest? Or the head?

329
00:28:47.804 --> 00:28:49.271
That's what your wife said.

330
00:28:49.406 --> 00:28:51.601
Would you stop with the wife shit?

331
00:28:52.009 --> 00:28:53.476
Ask me how fat she is.

332
00:28:53.543 --> 00:28:54.908
Fuck you.

333
00:28:58.715 --> 00:28:59.909
How fat is she?

334
00:29:00.017 --> 00:29:03.783
She's so fat l had to roll her in flour
and look for the wet spot.

335
00:29:04.054 --> 00:29:07.217
You want to fuck her.
you slap her thigh and ride the wave in.

336
00:29:08.125 --> 00:29:09.490
Now l'm not saying she's fat.

337
00:29:09.559 --> 00:29:12.153
Her high-school picture
was an aerial photograph.

338
00:29:21.305 --> 00:29:22.294
Bastard!

339
00:29:22.372 --> 00:29:23.771
And then some.

340
00:30:01.978 --> 00:30:03.775
Don't get out of your car.

341
00:30:04.181 --> 00:30:06.012
Can't you fucking drive?

342
00:31:12.482 --> 00:31:13.847
Back up.

343
00:31:14.951 --> 00:31:16.248
Back up.

344
00:32:00.831 --> 00:32:02.355
Leather pants?

345
00:32:07.804 --> 00:32:09.738
What's something like that run?

346
00:32:10.874 --> 00:32:12.068
Six-fifty.

347
00:32:13.677 --> 00:32:15.406
Six hundred and fifty dollars?

348
00:32:16.246 --> 00:32:17.406
The pants?

349
00:32:18.949 --> 00:32:20.416
You wear them?

350
00:32:20.584 --> 00:32:21.482
Yes.

351
00:32:21.952 --> 00:32:24.512
They have like a TV in them or something?

352
00:32:24.788 --> 00:32:25.777
Nope.

353
00:32:27.290 --> 00:32:29.190
l am very old.

354
00:32:37.767 --> 00:32:39.496
Something stinks in here.

355
00:32:40.303 --> 00:32:44.535
lt's his statement! lt's bullshit.
Hallenbeck is hiding something.

356
00:32:44.608 --> 00:32:45.597
How do you know?

357
00:32:45.675 --> 00:32:47.643
'Cause l know how the fuck
his mind works!

358
00:32:47.711 --> 00:32:51.112
Every lie has 80 percent truth to it.
lt's scary.

359
00:32:51.448 --> 00:32:53.143
We looking at the same guy?

360
00:32:53.216 --> 00:32:54.808
What is it you're looking at?

361
00:32:54.885 --> 00:32:57.445
A guy who looks like
he just slept in his clothes.

362
00:32:57.521 --> 00:33:00.115
That's what everybody sees.

363
00:33:00.557 --> 00:33:03.219
-There's more?
-A lot more.

364
00:33:03.326 --> 00:33:06.784
A long time ago. the same bastard
saved the president's life.

365
00:33:11.334 --> 00:33:14.861
Cory's story about some weirdo
hassling her was bullshit.

366
00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:21.042
l don't know what she was into.
but that was a professional hit tonight.

367
00:33:22.145 --> 00:33:23.544
Gangland style.

368
00:33:23.713 --> 00:33:26.705
l figure Mike was working for her.
same as me.

369
00:33:26.783 --> 00:33:28.250
He gets scared.

370
00:33:28.418 --> 00:33:29.749
Very scared.

371
00:33:29.986 --> 00:33:32.045
Bails out. dumps it in my lap.

372
00:33:32.222 --> 00:33:33.814
Guess he bailed out too late.

373
00:33:34.991 --> 00:33:37.152
They're still scraping him off my stucco.

374
00:33:39.162 --> 00:33:41.687
lf Mike knew this was dangerous...

375
00:33:41.765 --> 00:33:44.165
...why didn't he say anything to you?

376
00:33:44.601 --> 00:33:46.330
He was fucking my wife.

377
00:33:48.204 --> 00:33:50.536
l die...he gets the wife.

378
00:33:56.613 --> 00:33:57.671
Free to go.

379
00:33:57.747 --> 00:34:00.181
Pick up your gun at the property desk.

380
00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:02.341
You took all day.

381
00:34:02.719 --> 00:34:05.279
l got a call from the Bel Air P.D.

382
00:34:05.355 --> 00:34:09.815
Seems like Senator Baynard
has been getting obscene phone calls.

383
00:34:10.226 --> 00:34:12.091
l better not find out it's you.

384
00:34:13.697 --> 00:34:15.790
Anything else. Lieutenant?

385
00:34:16.333 --> 00:34:18.801
There's a new invention.
lt's called the razor.

386
00:34:18.902 --> 00:34:22.303
Too risky. l might start thinking about you
and slash my wrists.

387
00:34:24.407 --> 00:34:26.034
He got a beef with Baynard?

388
00:34:26.142 --> 00:34:28.474
The senator got him fired from his job.

389
00:34:28.545 --> 00:34:30.308
Was he a cop?

390
00:34:34.618 --> 00:34:36.415
Secret service?

391
00:34:38.088 --> 00:34:40.079
And Baynard had you fired?

392
00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:41.452
How come?

393
00:34:41.691 --> 00:34:43.420
None of your business.

394
00:34:56.106 --> 00:34:57.573
What are you doing here?

395
00:35:04.914 --> 00:35:06.905
l knocked out four of his teeth.

396
00:35:13.056 --> 00:35:15.718
You ever played ball?
You got a good build.

397
00:35:15.859 --> 00:35:17.053
What. are you a fag?

398
00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:19.151
No. l'm just trying to break the ice.

399
00:35:19.229 --> 00:35:22.062
l like ice. Leave it the fuck alone.

400
00:35:22.198 --> 00:35:23.665
You're a lot of fun to be with.

401
00:35:23.767 --> 00:35:25.166
Fuck you.

402
00:35:25.402 --> 00:35:28.371
So what's the next move. ace?
Where do we go from here?

403
00:35:28.471 --> 00:35:30.166
l'm going home.

404
00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:32.567
lt would seem my job is done.

405
00:35:32.676 --> 00:35:35.110
Fuck that. We saw Cory get murdered.

406
00:35:35.211 --> 00:35:38.339
You want to get your ass shot off. Flash.
be my guest.

407
00:35:38.448 --> 00:35:41.110
When you're dead.
l'll take your $600 pants.

408
00:35:42.252 --> 00:35:43.844
Six-fifty.

409
00:35:47.824 --> 00:35:50.190
You look familiar. Do l know you?

410
00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:52.621
You might. People recognize me.

411
00:35:52.796 --> 00:35:55.959
Got it! ''Cue Ball'' Morton.
Used to sell hash in Boyle Heights.

412
00:35:56.766 --> 00:35:59.701
No. l played football.
Jimmy Dix. L.A. Stallions.

413
00:35:59.803 --> 00:36:01.828
-What position?
-Forget it.

414
00:36:01.905 --> 00:36:05.636
Football. Free agents ruined
the goddamn game!

415
00:36:05.775 --> 00:36:09.302
We may run into more fans.
Want to borrow my sunglasses?

416
00:36:09.379 --> 00:36:11.870
-Fuck you.
-Snappy comeback.

417
00:36:12.615 --> 00:36:14.549
Where did Cory live?

418
00:36:14.684 --> 00:36:17.380
Harper Apartments. on Melrose. Why?

419
00:36:17.487 --> 00:36:19.717
Thinking about going by there.
take a look around.

420
00:36:19.789 --> 00:36:21.552
Good. l'll come with you.

421
00:36:21.658 --> 00:36:23.023
Fuck. you will.

422
00:36:23.293 --> 00:36:25.124
Have a nice night. Junior.

423
00:36:25.328 --> 00:36:28.991
-l know where she keeps the extra key.
-l won't need a key.

424
00:36:29.065 --> 00:36:31.625
And you're not worried about the alarm.

425
00:36:31.735 --> 00:36:34.829
lt's pretty high-tech. l put it in myself.

426
00:36:35.538 --> 00:36:38.166
But you probably know
how to circumvent it.

427
00:36:38.842 --> 00:36:39.831
Circumvent?

428
00:36:39.909 --> 00:36:42.139
lt's called a vocabulary. You read much?

429
00:36:42.245 --> 00:36:45.510
My subscription to ''Jugs'' just ran out.

430
00:36:49.986 --> 00:36:51.681
Get in the car.

431
00:36:55.492 --> 00:36:58.859
How did she afford a place like this?
These joints must run a fortune.

432
00:36:58.995 --> 00:37:02.556
-Tell me about it. l pay the rent.
-Ain't that charming.

433
00:37:03.166 --> 00:37:05.828
She sounds like a real special girl.

434
00:37:05.969 --> 00:37:08.301
What else you give her money for?
Clothes? Car payments?

435
00:37:08.371 --> 00:37:10.236
lt wasn't like that.

436
00:37:10.507 --> 00:37:12.873
Cory could've had plenty of rich guys.
Me. she loved.

437
00:37:12.942 --> 00:37:15.274
Love. Forget about it.

438
00:37:15.445 --> 00:37:16.605
You don't believe in love?

439
00:37:16.679 --> 00:37:19.239
Yeah. l believe in love. l believe in cancer.

440
00:37:19.349 --> 00:37:21.613
-They're both diseases?
-Something like that.

441
00:37:23.586 --> 00:37:26.384
l want to meet the bitch
that fucked you up.

442
00:37:30.827 --> 00:37:32.624
Your show. ace.

443
00:37:38.935 --> 00:37:41.495
-Security system?
-l circumvented it.

444
00:37:42.272 --> 00:37:45.400
Don't touch anything.
Don't leave a mess for the cops.

445
00:37:48.144 --> 00:37:50.078
Oh. my God!

446
00:37:51.748 --> 00:37:54.410
-You vacuum. l'll dust.
-Stay put.

447
00:37:55.919 --> 00:37:57.614
Go. Tarzan.

448
00:38:37.126 --> 00:38:39.117
Who's this guy with Cory?

449
00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:43.128
Shelly Marcone. Owns the L.A. Stallions.

450
00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:47.597
He used to date her for a while.
Treated her like shit and she left.

451
00:38:48.838 --> 00:38:50.635
-Where you going?
-To the bathroom.

452
00:38:50.707 --> 00:38:53.335
You want to come? The doc said
l shouldn't lift anything heavy.

453
00:38:53.409 --> 00:38:55.206
No. l'll pass.

454
00:39:33.983 --> 00:39:36.611
Ten to one.
this is what they were looking for.

455
00:39:41.557 --> 00:39:43.684
-That's Marcone.
-Yeah. l know.

456
00:39:43.793 --> 00:39:47.627
-l don't know who this is.
-Calvin Baynard. the senator.

457
00:39:47.764 --> 00:39:49.197
And these two assholes with him?

458
00:39:49.299 --> 00:39:52.393
His bodyguards.
He goes nowhere without protection.

459
00:39:52.535 --> 00:39:54.503
Xerox copy of a phone bill.

460
00:39:54.637 --> 00:39:56.730
What's this number they keep calling?

461
00:39:56.839 --> 00:39:59.069
Baynard's home phone number.

462
00:39:59.175 --> 00:40:01.268
You know the senator's home number?

463
00:40:01.477 --> 00:40:04.935
So l called him a couple of times.
Shut the fuck up.

464
00:40:06.883 --> 00:40:08.544
What's all this mean?

465
00:40:08.718 --> 00:40:11.346
l don't know. Junior. lf we're lucky...

466
00:40:12.288 --> 00:40:17.157
...blackmail evidence will put the two
most powerful men in California away.

467
00:40:17.527 --> 00:40:19.995
Why would Cory want to blackmail them?

468
00:40:20.063 --> 00:40:23.294
-You said she was fucking Marcone.
-l didn't say fucking. l said dating.

469
00:40:23.366 --> 00:40:26.927
Whatever she was doing. she heard
or saw something. The point is--

470
00:40:27.003 --> 00:40:29.130
-She tried to blackmail them.
-She hires Mike--

471
00:40:29.205 --> 00:40:31.639
-To get evidence against them.
-Right.

472
00:40:31.741 --> 00:40:33.038
Now we have the evidence.

473
00:40:33.109 --> 00:40:36.670
What we got is Marcone and Baynard
by the nuts.

474
00:40:36.779 --> 00:40:39.839
And that is why l love America.

475
00:40:42.318 --> 00:40:44.309
-Hello?
-Hey, Calvin?

476
00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:45.409
Shelly Marcone.

477
00:40:45.488 --> 00:40:47.422
-That's Marcone.
-How you doin'?

478
00:40:47.490 --> 00:40:49.788
I'd prefer if you didn't use my name.

479
00:40:49.926 --> 00:40:51.553
Man's skittish.

480
00:40:51.828 --> 00:40:56.265
If I didn't know better, I'd say you were
contemplating something shady.

481
00:40:56.432 --> 00:40:59.401
-There's no law against it.
-Get to the good stuff.

482
00:40:59.602 --> 00:41:02.298
-Not unless you pass one.
-l'll fast-forward.

483
00:41:02.438 --> 00:41:03.837
Don't!

484
00:41:04.007 --> 00:41:05.702
Fast-forward eats the tape!

485
00:41:05.775 --> 00:41:09.802
How should l know? Our only evidence
and your shitty car ate the tape!

486
00:41:09.879 --> 00:41:11.972
-The car sucks.
-Shut the fuck up!

487
00:41:12.448 --> 00:41:15.781
lf this is fucking ruined.
l'm going to crush your nuts.

488
00:41:16.085 --> 00:41:18.383
This is ruined. l swear to God.

489
00:41:22.025 --> 00:41:24.289
Fast-forward eats the tape.

490
00:41:30.733 --> 00:41:32.667
This is my birthday present.

491
00:41:37.573 --> 00:41:39.507
Cory was blackmailing Marcone.

492
00:41:39.575 --> 00:41:43.602
But she wasn't trying to get cash.
She was trying to get my old job back.

493
00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:46.039
She's dead because of me.

494
00:41:47.116 --> 00:41:48.447
Where you going?

495
00:41:48.518 --> 00:41:50.543
Home. l don't feel too hot.

496
00:41:50.753 --> 00:41:52.618
Come on. l'll take you home.

497
00:41:53.156 --> 00:41:54.885
l'll give you a ride.

498
00:41:55.258 --> 00:41:57.818
l'll take Cory's car. l got the key.

499
00:41:58.194 --> 00:42:00.890
l thought that was Cory's car at the bar?

500
00:42:13.643 --> 00:42:15.508
Cory had two cars.

501
00:42:22.752 --> 00:42:24.720
Get out of the car!

502
00:42:24.787 --> 00:42:27.119
What's your trip? What's wrong with you?

503
00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:39.293
-What is it?
-C-4.

504
00:42:39.635 --> 00:42:41.296
Plastic explosive.

505
00:42:41.537 --> 00:42:45.598
They wired the ignition to Mike's car.
They figured they'd do the same with hers.

506
00:42:45.675 --> 00:42:47.836
Lucky for you they wired the wrong car.

507
00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:50.879
Leave this for the cops to analyze.

508
00:42:51.047 --> 00:42:53.140
You're putting that in the trunk?

509
00:42:53.216 --> 00:42:56.208
No. we should just leave it
for the neighborhood kids to play with.

510
00:42:56.452 --> 00:42:58.147
Good evening. gentlemen.

511
00:43:07.296 --> 00:43:09.560
Where's the gun?

512
00:43:13.769 --> 00:43:17.227
-Bit late for a stroll.
-You girls should get home.

513
00:43:17.373 --> 00:43:20.001
-Street lights are on.
-Shut up. fuckface.

514
00:43:20.109 --> 00:43:22.373
l'm fuckface. He's asshole.

515
00:43:25.248 --> 00:43:27.944
Apprise Rodney Dangerfield here
of his situation.

516
00:43:30.119 --> 00:43:33.111
Perhaps we can dispense
with the fun and games now.

517
00:43:33.222 --> 00:43:36.555
-You want the envelope. right?
-Very smart.

518
00:43:36.626 --> 00:43:39.993
Here's a man who knows
when a situation is untenable.

519
00:43:40.229 --> 00:43:41.662
Good word.

520
00:43:41.898 --> 00:43:43.365
You like that word?

521
00:43:44.267 --> 00:43:46.098
You do have that envelope?

522
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:50.569
We better give up.
We're dealing with a couple geniuses here.

523
00:43:52.875 --> 00:43:54.900
Leave him the fuck alone.

524
00:43:55.178 --> 00:43:58.045
''Leave him alone''?
Sure. whatever you say.

525
00:43:58.147 --> 00:44:01.514
Jake attacks his job
with a certain exuberance.

526
00:44:02.485 --> 00:44:04.510
We're being beat up
by the inventor of Scrabble.

527
00:44:04.587 --> 00:44:08.114
-He's still happy. Kick him again.
-All right.

528
00:44:09.959 --> 00:44:11.688
Want the hooker's envelope?

529
00:44:11.761 --> 00:44:14.389
-She wasn't a hooker.
-Shut the fuck up!

530
00:44:14.664 --> 00:44:15.892
Where is it?

531
00:44:17.767 --> 00:44:19.325
ln the trunk.

532
00:44:19.769 --> 00:44:21.031
Give me the keys.

533
00:44:22.672 --> 00:44:24.401
Slow and easy.

534
00:44:25.208 --> 00:44:26.573
Give them to Jake.

535
00:44:31.247 --> 00:44:33.772
Dumb bastard. you'll pay for that.

536
00:44:35.017 --> 00:44:36.917
Open the trunk.

537
00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:49.425
Son of a bitch!

538
00:44:56.772 --> 00:44:57.864
You alive?

539
00:44:57.940 --> 00:44:59.840
l don't know. yet.

540
00:45:00.943 --> 00:45:02.570
Was that C-4?

541
00:45:03.679 --> 00:45:05.772
That. or a hell of a factory recall.

542
00:45:05.848 --> 00:45:07.816
Dead guys don't make bad jokes.

543
00:45:09.385 --> 00:45:11.182
Shit. we're alive.

544
00:45:18.261 --> 00:45:20.024
Come on. get out of here.

545
00:45:21.964 --> 00:45:23.932
-You sure?
-l'll take the heat on this.

546
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.695
You positive?

547
00:45:29.438 --> 00:45:32.236
This is a police matter.
you dumb son of a bitch!

548
00:45:32.375 --> 00:45:36.641
And l'm sick and tired of sweeping up
your dead bodies!

549
00:45:37.613 --> 00:45:39.410
Next time l see your ugly mug...

550
00:45:39.515 --> 00:45:42.143
...l'll put a bullet in it! You got it?

551
00:45:59.135 --> 00:46:01.433
l just wanted to shake your hand.

552
00:46:03.973 --> 00:46:08.103
Ben told me about what you did
for the president. l respect that.

553
00:46:24.527 --> 00:46:25.926
Hey. ugly.

554
00:46:26.128 --> 00:46:28.653
Looks like our evidence got blown up.

555
00:46:29.065 --> 00:46:31.090
l think we might have to get some more.

556
00:46:34.837 --> 00:46:36.634
Just won't let go. huh?

557
00:46:36.772 --> 00:46:38.831
You're like a dog with a Frisbee.

558
00:46:38.974 --> 00:46:43.343
My girl's dead. The guys that did it
are at Spago's eating Chicken Marsala.

559
00:46:43.446 --> 00:46:45.710
And Reindeer Goat-Cheese Pizza.

560
00:46:46.782 --> 00:46:48.272
lt ain't right.

561
00:46:50.152 --> 00:46:51.642
No. it ain't right.

562
00:47:00.830 --> 00:47:02.889
This ain't no game. Flash.

563
00:47:03.899 --> 00:47:05.560
Real guns.

564
00:47:05.701 --> 00:47:07.225
Real bullets.

565
00:47:08.337 --> 00:47:10.305
lt's dangerous.

566
00:47:10.906 --> 00:47:12.703
Danger's my middle name.

567
00:47:13.409 --> 00:47:15.377
Mine's Cornelius.

568
00:47:15.978 --> 00:47:17.673
Tell anybody. l'll kill you.

569
00:47:17.847 --> 00:47:20.714
-You ever watch ''Soul Train''?
-Shut the fuck up.

570
00:47:21.217 --> 00:47:23.151
We start tomorrow.

571
00:47:23.419 --> 00:47:26.616
ln the meantime. l'd like to see my family.

572
00:47:37.199 --> 00:47:38.996
Your family. huh?

573
00:47:39.335 --> 00:47:40.768
You got kids?

574
00:47:40.970 --> 00:47:43.461
-A little girl.
-Does she like you?

575
00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:46.165
No. not too much.

576
00:47:46.409 --> 00:47:48.639
She likes Prince. Go figure.

577
00:47:49.311 --> 00:47:50.778
l like Prince.

578
00:48:02.591 --> 00:48:04.081
An actual house.

579
00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:07.227
l was thinking of a cave
with skulls and shit.

580
00:48:11.667 --> 00:48:14.465
Feel like l've been rode hard
and put away wet.

581
00:48:15.204 --> 00:48:16.865
What the hell does that mean?

582
00:48:16.939 --> 00:48:18.463
lt's horse talk.

583
00:48:19.375 --> 00:48:21.240
Brothers ride horses now?

584
00:48:21.644 --> 00:48:23.908
Cars are getting too hard to steal.

585
00:48:24.013 --> 00:48:26.208
You ever wear a little cowboy hat?

586
00:48:27.450 --> 00:48:29.008
l'm really good.

587
00:48:29.218 --> 00:48:31.049
Maybe l could take your daughter out.

588
00:48:31.153 --> 00:48:35.453
She's 13 and if you look at her funny. l'll
stick an umbrella up your ass and open it.

589
00:48:42.698 --> 00:48:45.667
-Why aren't you in bed?
-Darian's watching TV.

590
00:48:47.970 --> 00:48:51.303
-l can see that.
-She's also pissed at you big time.

591
00:48:54.276 --> 00:48:55.743
What happened to your face?

592
00:48:55.811 --> 00:48:58.143
My God! lt speaks!

593
00:48:59.048 --> 00:49:02.040
Nothing happened to my face.
lt always looks like this.

594
00:49:02.151 --> 00:49:03.675
What's wrong with his face?

595
00:49:03.786 --> 00:49:08.018
His nose is too pointy.
His eyes are beady. His ears are too big.

596
00:49:08.224 --> 00:49:09.987
He needs a shave.

597
00:49:10.693 --> 00:49:13.594
l'm peeing my pants. you're so funny.

598
00:49:14.196 --> 00:49:16.096
My daughter. Darian.

599
00:49:16.799 --> 00:49:18.096
My name is Jimmy.

600
00:49:18.334 --> 00:49:20.302
Why is that number
on the back of your head?

601
00:49:20.369 --> 00:49:22.929
ls it a license plate in case it's stolen?

602
00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:27.409
No. it's a football thing.
lt's my high-school number.

603
00:49:28.444 --> 00:49:30.105
So when do you graduate?

604
00:49:31.447 --> 00:49:33.847
You want to be left alone. don't you?

605
00:49:34.817 --> 00:49:36.614
l'll be in the kitchen.

606
00:49:36.819 --> 00:49:38.218
Over here.

607
00:49:44.727 --> 00:49:46.752
She's got your winning personality.

608
00:49:46.962 --> 00:49:48.793
You get used to it.

609
00:49:49.398 --> 00:49:51.662
l got some ice cream. You want some?

610
00:49:51.767 --> 00:49:54.235
Leave me alone! l hate you!

611
00:49:55.971 --> 00:49:59.202
She's pissed off
'cause l wouldn't let her date Tommy.

612
00:49:59.341 --> 00:50:01.969
l only missed the best party of the year.

613
00:50:02.111 --> 00:50:03.738
Why didn't you let her go?

614
00:50:05.114 --> 00:50:07.742
Because she's 13 years old. jerk-off.

615
00:50:09.218 --> 00:50:12.517
-Want some ice cream or not?
-l'm not talking to you.

616
00:50:12.688 --> 00:50:14.246
That's a shame.

617
00:50:14.323 --> 00:50:16.655
l'll miss all those pleasant things
you always say to me.

618
00:50:16.759 --> 00:50:18.659
''Dad. l hate you.''

619
00:50:19.562 --> 00:50:21.291
lt's chocolate chip. your favorite.

620
00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:22.988
l don't care.

621
00:50:23.232 --> 00:50:24.756
You're an asshole.

622
00:50:32.841 --> 00:50:35.275
You know how l hate to waste food.

623
00:50:35.878 --> 00:50:37.778
You want to abuse me some more?

624
00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:39.174
Shock me.

625
00:50:39.348 --> 00:50:42.010
-l hardly ever hear the word ''asshole.''
-Bullshit!

626
00:50:42.184 --> 00:50:44.345
-Bet you hear it all the time!
-That's enough!

627
00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:47.651
-What'll you do. ground me some more?
-lf you want.

628
00:50:47.723 --> 00:50:49.350
Yes. sir. asshole.

629
00:50:49.458 --> 00:50:51.722
-You're grounded for a week.
-Leave me alone!

630
00:50:52.194 --> 00:50:54.128
He thinks he's Ward Cleaver.

631
00:50:54.196 --> 00:50:57.654
You want to talk like a trash-mouth?
Sound like your mother? Go ahead.

632
00:50:57.766 --> 00:51:02.032
lt's bad enough l gotta hear this shit
all day. but l gotta hear it from you. too.

633
00:51:02.137 --> 00:51:04.071
Why don't you go easy on the girl. man?

634
00:51:04.173 --> 00:51:06.107
Don't tell me how to talk to my kid.

635
00:51:06.208 --> 00:51:09.541
Let me hear it. Let me hear
the really juicy dirty words.

636
00:51:09.678 --> 00:51:11.543
You're such a fuckup.

637
00:51:14.583 --> 00:51:17.882
You're my daughter. you're in my home.
You will respect me. You got that?

638
00:51:17.953 --> 00:51:19.250
Never call me a fuckup.

639
00:51:19.321 --> 00:51:22.722
Why shouldn't l?
Mom calls you one all the time.

640
00:51:23.759 --> 00:51:25.818
Your mother called me a fuckup?

641
00:51:26.295 --> 00:51:27.284
When?

642
00:51:27.363 --> 00:51:30.423
-On the phone with Uncle Jay.
-Uncle Jay?

643
00:51:31.867 --> 00:51:36.566
l'm a fuckup. but Uncle Jay.
there's a real stand-up guy.

644
00:51:36.672 --> 00:51:39.140
The bastard cheats on his taxes.

645
00:51:39.208 --> 00:51:43.144
Go ask your mother why
Mr. Wonderful's not in jail for tax evasion.

646
00:51:43.212 --> 00:51:44.839
Because he doesn't fuck up.

647
00:51:47.683 --> 00:51:48.980
Go to bed.

648
00:52:01.096 --> 00:52:04.657
For 50 bucks you could pay a guy
to pull her fingernails out.

649
00:52:05.434 --> 00:52:08.062
Anything that much fun
l'd rather do myself.

650
00:52:10.205 --> 00:52:13.106
l don't know about you.
but l could use a drink.

651
00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:19.541
Shit. That's you?

652
00:52:19.648 --> 00:52:21.616
You were fucking Ward Cleaver.

653
00:52:22.651 --> 00:52:24.676
l was a regular Boy Scout.

654
00:52:26.755 --> 00:52:28.620
You and the president.

655
00:52:28.891 --> 00:52:31.189
Damn. hanging with the Man.

656
00:52:31.493 --> 00:52:35.224
Looks like one of those
cardboard cutout things.

657
00:52:35.431 --> 00:52:37.991
l once had my picture taken
with Don Johnson like that.

658
00:52:38.067 --> 00:52:41.036
-You still got the picture?
-l threw it away.

659
00:52:43.305 --> 00:52:45.296
Are you getting a divorce?

660
00:52:46.809 --> 00:52:48.037
l don't know.

661
00:52:49.712 --> 00:52:51.942
You don't like women much. do you?

662
00:52:53.015 --> 00:52:55.142
l liked the guy she was fucking.

663
00:52:56.452 --> 00:52:58.420
He was my best friend.

664
00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:00.818
He was a scumbag private detective.

665
00:53:01.724 --> 00:53:04.659
All private detectives are scumbags.

666
00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:06.987
That scumbag tried to get you killed.

667
00:53:08.731 --> 00:53:10.824
Friends can't be perfect.

668
00:53:13.736 --> 00:53:15.795
l wish the sky wasn't blue.

669
00:53:16.038 --> 00:53:17.972
l wish water wasn't wet.

670
00:53:19.274 --> 00:53:21.674
l wish l didn't still love my wife.

671
00:53:29.785 --> 00:53:31.480
Life sucks.

672
00:53:32.621 --> 00:53:34.589
To Alex. the accountant.

673
00:53:35.257 --> 00:53:36.849
Your accountant's name is Alex?

674
00:53:41.864 --> 00:53:43.525
He could have been.

675
00:53:44.767 --> 00:53:46.530
Alex was my son.

676
00:53:50.205 --> 00:53:52.105
l used to be married.

677
00:53:55.644 --> 00:53:58.477
One Sunday. l'm away in Miami....

678
00:53:59.581 --> 00:54:02.482
She couldn't come
'cause she was eight months pregnant.

679
00:54:03.719 --> 00:54:06.119
Walking down La Brea Boulevard...

680
00:54:06.655 --> 00:54:09.283
...out of nowhere a pickup truck
jumped a curb.

681
00:54:10.859 --> 00:54:12.622
Never knew what hit her.

682
00:54:14.363 --> 00:54:15.728
She died.

683
00:54:23.405 --> 00:54:26.568
But Alex lived for 1 7 minutes
in an incubator.

684
00:54:28.110 --> 00:54:29.907
He fell asleep.

685
00:54:31.013 --> 00:54:32.844
Had time for one dream.

686
00:54:34.383 --> 00:54:35.850
Then he died.

687
00:54:50.365 --> 00:54:52.663
l think about him all the time.

688
00:54:55.571 --> 00:54:58.096
l threw for 300 yards that day.

689
00:54:59.308 --> 00:55:01.435
While my wife and kid were dying...

690
00:55:03.178 --> 00:55:04.975
...l had the game of my life.

691
00:55:10.686 --> 00:55:12.119
Life sucks.

692
00:55:13.956 --> 00:55:16.117
Can l use your shower?

693
00:55:19.561 --> 00:55:22.291
Bathroom's down the hall.
first door on the right.

694
00:55:30.539 --> 00:55:32.370
Flash. l brought you a towel.

695
00:55:45.821 --> 00:55:48.483
This what you were looking for
at Cory's apartment?

696
00:55:50.225 --> 00:55:51.988
This what you were looking for?

697
00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:54.722
-That's $1.000 worth of shit!
-Fuck it!

698
00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:58.495
Get the fuck out of my house
before l break your neck.

699
00:56:03.772 --> 00:56:05.569
l use that shit to get by.

700
00:56:05.774 --> 00:56:08.242
l don't use it. l get by.

701
00:56:09.945 --> 00:56:11.537
Get dressed and get out.

702
00:56:11.613 --> 00:56:13.308
All right. l forgot.

703
00:56:13.548 --> 00:56:16.142
Talking to Dudley fucking Do-right.

704
00:56:17.286 --> 00:56:19.914
That shit happens real easy.

705
00:56:20.455 --> 00:56:21.922
lt starts out...

706
00:56:23.659 --> 00:56:25.149
...painkillers.

707
00:56:25.327 --> 00:56:28.160
Using Demerol
because your fucking knees are shot!

708
00:56:30.198 --> 00:56:33.861
Before you know it. you're chewing
codeine with your pancakes.

709
00:56:35.971 --> 00:56:38.064
Then a truck comes out of nowhere...

710
00:56:38.173 --> 00:56:40.971
...and you're talking to God. saying:

711
00:56:41.276 --> 00:56:42.834
''Help me out. Big Guy.

712
00:56:43.278 --> 00:56:47.510
''l pay taxes. l go to church.
What's with this dead wife and kid shit?''

713
00:56:49.217 --> 00:56:51.185
But He ain't answering.

714
00:56:51.453 --> 00:56:53.614
He ain't taking no calls that day.

715
00:56:54.189 --> 00:56:57.056
lnstead. l get a call
from the fucking League.

716
00:56:57.359 --> 00:57:00.658
They're saying. ''Kid. your career's over.''

717
00:57:01.997 --> 00:57:03.555
l say. ''Why?''

718
00:57:03.665 --> 00:57:05.633
Because l gambled.

719
00:57:06.134 --> 00:57:09.797
Why is there an injury report
in pro football?

720
00:57:09.938 --> 00:57:11.599
Nobody else has one.

721
00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:13.799
But pro football does.

722
00:57:14.042 --> 00:57:15.566
You know why?

723
00:57:16.178 --> 00:57:19.147
That's so the gamblers
will have a fucking accurate spread!

724
00:57:19.448 --> 00:57:23.214
lt's all business now.
They push until you blow your brains out.

725
00:57:23.318 --> 00:57:25.081
Just like Billy Cole did!

726
00:57:25.554 --> 00:57:28.489
Can't you see the hypocrites
took away my life!

727
00:57:31.026 --> 00:57:34.325
When you're done feeling sorry
for yourself. the door's that way.

728
00:57:42.270 --> 00:57:43.669
You bastard.

729
00:57:47.442 --> 00:57:49.103
And then some.

730
00:57:58.987 --> 00:58:00.579
Would you sign my card?

731
00:58:03.191 --> 00:58:05.125
Sorry l was so bitchy before.

732
00:58:06.762 --> 00:58:08.662
l guess your dad's pretty pissed.

733
00:58:08.730 --> 00:58:10.425
He'll get over it.

734
00:58:11.333 --> 00:58:13.358
You were his biggest hero.

735
00:58:13.802 --> 00:58:15.030
Since when?

736
00:58:15.170 --> 00:58:16.535
Since l was little.

737
00:58:16.705 --> 00:58:18.696
You should've heard him.
''Jimmy. this. Jimmy that.

738
00:58:18.774 --> 00:58:20.742
''Best quarterback in the game.''

739
00:58:21.009 --> 00:58:23.534
When you got busted. he quit watching.

740
00:58:26.848 --> 00:58:29.146
Does he punch all his heroes?

741
00:58:31.887 --> 00:58:36.324
To the daughter of the last Boy Scout.
Jimmy Dix.

742
00:58:52.874 --> 00:58:54.136
Good morning. Jimmy.

743
00:58:54.443 --> 00:58:56.240
Who are you?
How do you know my name?

744
00:58:56.311 --> 00:58:59.474
-Now is this the guy? You sure?
-lt's him.

745
00:58:59.548 --> 00:59:01.914
This is the kid with the million-dollar arm?

746
00:59:01.983 --> 00:59:03.075
Don't look like much.

747
00:59:03.318 --> 00:59:05.912
l can't tell which of you
looks the most like my dick.

748
00:59:06.021 --> 00:59:09.184
Say what you got to say.
or get out of my way.

749
00:59:13.929 --> 00:59:15.692
Grab him. Grab him.

750
00:59:30.112 --> 00:59:31.943
lt's okay. lt's okay. folks!

751
00:59:33.415 --> 00:59:35.110
lt's okay. lt's okay.

752
00:59:35.517 --> 00:59:37.178
Thank you. Thank you.

753
00:59:37.786 --> 00:59:39.447
Danger is my middle name.

754
00:59:39.888 --> 00:59:42.857
Don't try this at home. folks.
l'm a trained professional.

755
00:59:42.958 --> 00:59:44.448
There's me...

756
00:59:44.860 --> 00:59:46.521
...and there's Super Dave.

757
00:59:51.867 --> 00:59:53.892
l got bad news and bad news.

758
00:59:54.002 --> 00:59:55.264
Give me the bad news first.

759
00:59:55.337 --> 00:59:58.363
Bad news is someone bounced
Jimmy Dix off a car.

760
00:59:58.607 --> 01:00:00.006
Now give me the bad news.

761
01:00:00.075 --> 01:00:02.908
l just took a statement
from Hallenbeck's neighbor.

762
01:00:03.011 --> 01:00:06.071
The day he died. Mike Matthews
came to Hallenbeck's house...

763
01:00:06.181 --> 01:00:08.877
...early in the morning to discuss a case.

764
01:00:08.984 --> 01:00:10.611
So Hallenbeck says.

765
01:00:10.886 --> 01:00:12.820
How come Hallenbeck's neighbor claims...

766
01:00:12.921 --> 01:00:16.049
...Matthews's car was parked there
all night in the same spot?

767
01:00:19.728 --> 01:00:20.990
Why did he lie?

768
01:00:26.001 --> 01:00:28.401
Matthews is fucking his wife.

769
01:00:29.704 --> 01:00:33.401
That's why the car was there.
Matthews was fucking his wife.

770
01:00:33.508 --> 01:00:35.908
Hallenbeck just got back in to town.

771
01:00:36.144 --> 01:00:39.341
Christ. Joe wasted the bastard himself.

772
01:00:43.351 --> 01:00:46.184
He waltzed right out of my office.

773
01:00:46.354 --> 01:00:48.345
l let the son of a bitch go.

774
01:00:48.423 --> 01:00:50.755
Give me a chance. l'll get him back.

775
01:01:25.193 --> 01:01:26.455
Tommy.

776
01:01:35.837 --> 01:01:38.965
You can go to a party when you're 1 7.

777
01:01:41.776 --> 01:01:43.141
Good morning. Joseph.

778
01:02:04.366 --> 01:02:06.357
We got trouble. Milo.

779
01:02:06.868 --> 01:02:08.802
Pick up his gun by the trigger guard.

780
01:02:08.903 --> 01:02:10.268
Give it to me.

781
01:02:15.410 --> 01:02:17.071
ls there a problem?

782
01:02:17.178 --> 01:02:19.408
Yes. Officer. As a matter of fact. there is.

783
01:02:19.481 --> 01:02:22.075
Apparently. there are
too many bullets in this gun.

784
01:02:25.687 --> 01:02:27.382
Fingerprints.

785
01:02:29.658 --> 01:02:31.216
Naughty boy. Joseph.

786
01:02:31.326 --> 01:02:33.385
You just shot a police officer.

787
01:03:01.823 --> 01:03:04.018
It's you, Daddy.

788
01:03:12.667 --> 01:03:13.998
l think he's awake.

789
01:03:14.102 --> 01:03:15.330
Make sure.

790
01:03:25.547 --> 01:03:27.014
l'm awake.

791
01:03:28.416 --> 01:03:30.179
You nearly broke my wrist.

792
01:03:30.852 --> 01:03:33.184
Milo warned us to watch out for him.

793
01:03:33.455 --> 01:03:34.683
Fuck that!

794
01:03:34.923 --> 01:03:38.359
Fuck you! Look at him.
He's nothing. Guy's a piece of shit.

795
01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:40.086
Got a cigarette?

796
01:03:41.296 --> 01:03:42.661
Cigarette? Sure.

797
01:03:43.531 --> 01:03:45.021
l got a cigarette.

798
01:03:48.069 --> 01:03:49.263
Got a light?

799
01:03:49.437 --> 01:03:50.995
Yes. l got a light.

800
01:04:01.716 --> 01:04:03.047
l thought you were tough.

801
01:04:03.785 --> 01:04:05.309
See? He's not so bad.

802
01:04:11.393 --> 01:04:13.384
l seem to have dropped my cigarette.

803
01:04:17.298 --> 01:04:18.629
May l have another?

804
01:04:25.173 --> 01:04:26.800
Sure thing. buddy.

805
01:04:33.581 --> 01:04:35.071
l'll need a light.

806
01:04:36.818 --> 01:04:38.649
lf you touch me again. l'll kill you.

807
01:04:46.961 --> 01:04:47.985
Baby!

808
01:04:51.433 --> 01:04:52.525
Oh. baby!

809
01:04:52.934 --> 01:04:54.060
Two for two.

810
01:05:00.675 --> 01:05:01.733
Told you.

811
01:05:03.111 --> 01:05:04.635
Jesus Christ.

812
01:05:08.049 --> 01:05:09.073
You killed him!

813
01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:11.948
You fucking-A killed him! He's dead!

814
01:05:14.489 --> 01:05:15.786
ls there a problem?

815
01:05:16.157 --> 01:05:20.287
He just killed Chet.
Put his fuckin' nose through his brain!

816
01:05:20.862 --> 01:05:22.056
l needed a light.

817
01:05:24.833 --> 01:05:26.892
You don't disappoint me.

818
01:05:28.670 --> 01:05:30.137
But you took an awful risk.

819
01:05:30.205 --> 01:05:32.298
Pablo could've shot you dead.

820
01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:34.874
lf you wanted me dead.
you'd have killed me before.

821
01:05:35.577 --> 01:05:37.135
That's true.

822
01:05:39.514 --> 01:05:42.847
-Can we do a formal introduction?
-Who gives a fuck?

823
01:05:43.651 --> 01:05:45.084
You're the bad guy.

824
01:05:45.386 --> 01:05:46.717
l am the bad guy.

825
01:05:46.788 --> 01:05:49.382
And l'm supposed to tremble with fear?

826
01:05:49.491 --> 01:05:50.822
Something like that.

827
01:05:51.459 --> 01:05:52.585
Fine.

828
01:05:52.994 --> 01:05:54.586
l'll start in a minute.

829
01:05:54.829 --> 01:05:57.195
Meanwhile. could l have a drink?

830
01:05:57.365 --> 01:05:59.230
l don't see why not.

831
01:05:59.734 --> 01:06:03.101
Take Chet's corpse away
and fix Mr. Hallenbeck a drink.

832
01:06:03.238 --> 01:06:04.705
Make that two.

833
01:06:08.109 --> 01:06:10.737
lf it isn't Shelly Marcone himself!

834
01:06:10.945 --> 01:06:12.412
Careful. son.

835
01:06:12.747 --> 01:06:14.510
Only friends call me Shelly.

836
01:06:14.983 --> 01:06:16.382
You have friends?

837
01:06:16.618 --> 01:06:18.108
When did this happen?

838
01:06:19.087 --> 01:06:22.523
Boy. you sure are feisty
for a fellow in your position.

839
01:06:24.225 --> 01:06:26.523
Milo. teach him some manners.

840
01:06:32.834 --> 01:06:34.802
Touch me again. l'll kill you.

841
01:06:40.375 --> 01:06:43.071
What fucking conspiracy
are you talking about?

842
01:06:43.144 --> 01:06:47.342
Hallenbeck's a fruit loop.
He's been after Senator Baynard for years.

843
01:06:47.448 --> 01:06:50.940
You want me to believe
the senator's mixed up in this?

844
01:06:51.386 --> 01:06:54.787
l'll say it again
for the cheap seats. Lieutenant.

845
01:06:55.390 --> 01:06:59.224
l don't know where Joe is!
That's my fucking statement!

846
01:06:59.294 --> 01:07:01.888
Write it down and shove it up your ass.

847
01:07:02.196 --> 01:07:03.993
l could nail you for obstruction.

848
01:07:04.065 --> 01:07:08.627
You couldn't nail a $2 whore.
Charge me with something or let me out!

849
01:07:08.736 --> 01:07:10.966
My husband did not kill a cop!

850
01:07:11.406 --> 01:07:14.307
Aside from that. l can't help you.
May we go now?

851
01:07:15.743 --> 01:07:18.507
Can l have a minute
with your mom in private?

852
01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:19.977
Pleasure.

853
01:07:23.284 --> 01:07:27.914
Do you deny being sexually involved
with Michael Matthews prior to his death?

854
01:07:29.357 --> 01:07:30.619
Why am l calling?

855
01:07:30.692 --> 01:07:33.855
'Cause l had to hear your sweet voice.
And l need a favor.

856
01:07:33.928 --> 01:07:37.489
No. it ain't like that.
No. it wasn't no liquor talking.

857
01:07:38.833 --> 01:07:41.666
You're not fat.
You're just a whole lot of woman.

858
01:07:41.736 --> 01:07:43.328
Do me a favor. big mama.

859
01:07:43.404 --> 01:07:46.737
Senator Calvin Baynard.
He's a season ticket holder. right?

860
01:07:46.975 --> 01:07:50.172
Punch up his address and tell me
where you send the tickets.

861
01:07:56.551 --> 01:07:58.212
Good girl.

862
01:08:03.124 --> 01:08:04.284
Great.

863
01:08:06.361 --> 01:08:08.056
Don't worry. l'll find your dad.

864
01:08:08.296 --> 01:08:09.456
How?

865
01:08:09.731 --> 01:08:12.632
When in doubt. try the nearest bad guy.

866
01:08:17.138 --> 01:08:19.470
Football is a dying beast. Joe.

867
01:08:21.509 --> 01:08:23.170
No heroes left.

868
01:08:23.378 --> 01:08:24.868
Not anymore.

869
01:08:25.246 --> 01:08:29.580
Since old Sonny Werblin paid
$400.000 to Joe Namath in '66...

870
01:08:30.551 --> 01:08:33.111
...the bastards have just gotten greedier.

871
01:08:33.321 --> 01:08:35.881
God Almighty. when's it enough?

872
01:08:36.424 --> 01:08:40.383
Jesus. free agents.
''Give me. give me. give me. give me.''

873
01:08:40.495 --> 01:08:44.898
Now you got guys on PCP.
shooting themselves on the field.

874
01:08:44.999 --> 01:08:49.493
The American public's piss-pot tired
of it and they're changing the channel.

875
01:08:49.904 --> 01:08:51.428
The ratings are down.

876
01:08:52.507 --> 01:08:55.567
So you'll bribe senators
to legalize gambling.

877
01:08:55.810 --> 01:08:58.005
Legalize sports gambling.

878
01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:01.580
You see. with all the heroes gone...

879
01:09:02.016 --> 01:09:05.281
...only legalized gambling
will save the beast.

880
01:09:05.987 --> 01:09:07.682
You follow me?

881
01:09:07.855 --> 01:09:09.914
We're talking about some big bucks.

882
01:09:10.091 --> 01:09:12.082
We're talking about billions.

883
01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:14.592
That's nine zeroes. son.

884
01:09:14.796 --> 01:09:16.491
l'm not your fucking son.

885
01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:22.797
Have you ever heard
of the Senate's Commission...

886
01:09:23.004 --> 01:09:25.802
...to lnvestigate Gambling
in Professional Sports?

887
01:09:25.907 --> 01:09:27.568
ls that who you're paying off?

888
01:09:27.942 --> 01:09:30.035
The commission's gonna vote next March.

889
01:09:30.144 --> 01:09:33.978
l got them all in my hip pocket.
except Senator Calvin Baynard.

890
01:09:34.449 --> 01:09:37.111
l tried to bribe that son of a bitch.

891
01:09:37.752 --> 01:09:40.277
He gave it back because it wasn't enough.

892
01:09:42.156 --> 01:09:44.249
-What's he want?
-Six million.

893
01:09:44.792 --> 01:09:47.192
Or he'll go straight to the police.

894
01:09:48.229 --> 01:09:51.494
l think it's just gonna be cheaper
to kill that son of a bitch.

895
01:09:52.834 --> 01:09:56.395
Taking off a senator is ballsy.
even for an asshole like you.

896
01:09:56.504 --> 01:09:58.335
You said it. Joe-boy.

897
01:09:58.506 --> 01:10:01.737
That's why we'll frame you
for the senator's murder.

898
01:10:04.979 --> 01:10:08.471
As chairman of the commission.
l'll simply say this:

899
01:10:08.683 --> 01:10:13.086
l'm reviewing both sides of the issue
with utmost care...

900
01:10:13.221 --> 01:10:14.552
...and scrutiny.

901
01:10:14.622 --> 01:10:18.956
l will adopt a position
based on what is best for the sport.

902
01:10:19.961 --> 01:10:21.758
ln the meantime...

903
01:10:22.363 --> 01:10:26.299
...l can't wait to get to the Coliseum
to watch my favorite L.A. team...

904
01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:28.732
...kick the hell out of Tampa Bay.

905
01:10:28.936 --> 01:10:29.960
Cut!

906
01:10:31.038 --> 01:10:34.166
-Thank you. Senator.
-Thank you. Always a pleasure.

907
01:10:38.246 --> 01:10:41.545
Come on. Jimmy. think. think. think.
What would Joe do?

908
01:10:41.783 --> 01:10:45.685
He'd shoot everybody. Smoke
some cigarettes. But l have no gun.

909
01:10:49.924 --> 01:10:52.518
-How'd you get here?
-l hitched.

910
01:10:54.061 --> 01:10:56.689
l meant. how did you find me?

911
01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:01.694
My dad's a detective. What can l say?

912
01:11:03.304 --> 01:11:06.034
You didn't cover your tracks.
You're easy to trace.

913
01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:08.401
Just what l need. Nancy fucking Drew.

914
01:11:08.609 --> 01:11:10.270
l brought you this.

915
01:11:10.344 --> 01:11:11.971
Where did you get that?

916
01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:13.804
Stole it from my dad's closet.

917
01:11:13.881 --> 01:11:15.473
He'd kill me if he found out.

918
01:11:15.550 --> 01:11:17.711
You'll kill yourself first. you jerk.

919
01:11:17.952 --> 01:11:20.819
Take this ugly monkey and get out of here.

920
01:11:21.989 --> 01:11:24.423
-l want to know what's going on.
-Watch CNN.

921
01:11:24.492 --> 01:11:25.584
Go.

922
01:11:27.195 --> 01:11:29.629
Those are the bodyguards in the picture.

923
01:11:30.731 --> 01:11:33.757
They're leaving without the senator.
l have to follow them. Go.

924
01:11:33.835 --> 01:11:37.066
-l'm coming with you.
-You can't come. Go home.

925
01:11:37.371 --> 01:11:38.497
Kiss my ass.

926
01:11:39.006 --> 01:11:40.234
Kiss my ass.

927
01:11:40.441 --> 01:11:41.999
ls that clear enough?

928
01:11:42.243 --> 01:11:43.369
Fine.

929
01:11:43.711 --> 01:11:45.372
You little brat.

930
01:11:45.746 --> 01:11:48.681
We're just gonna follow them.
How dangerous can that be?

931
01:11:56.324 --> 01:11:57.655
We're in position.

932
01:11:57.758 --> 01:12:00.955
The senator's men are en route.
E.T.A.. five minutes.

933
01:12:16.878 --> 01:12:18.869
Damn. where are they going?

934
01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:20.606
Let's find out.

935
01:12:20.681 --> 01:12:21.648
Here.

936
01:12:21.716 --> 01:12:24.514
l told you no guns. right? l hate guns.

937
01:12:25.319 --> 01:12:27.844
You stay here. l'll go look around. Stay!

938
01:12:43.471 --> 01:12:44.460
Six mil.

939
01:12:44.538 --> 01:12:45.903
Excuse me.

940
01:12:46.107 --> 01:12:50.043
Did any of you stupid shits
bother to frisk this fuck?

941
01:12:51.412 --> 01:12:54.404
He could be a goddamn cop.
Will you frisk him?

942
01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:00.812
Take it easy.

943
01:13:04.258 --> 01:13:05.316
lt's okay.

944
01:13:05.426 --> 01:13:07.417
Hand him the briefcase. Joseph.

945
01:13:20.942 --> 01:13:22.102
Nice suit.

946
01:13:31.452 --> 01:13:34.285
The briefcase was loaded with explosives.
wasn't it?

947
01:13:34.422 --> 01:13:38.188
Ten pounds of C-4
is on the way to the Coliseum right now.

948
01:13:38.726 --> 01:13:40.660
lt's ironic. don't you think?

949
01:13:40.828 --> 01:13:44.423
This bomb will be delivered
to Baynard by his own bodyguards.

950
01:13:45.566 --> 01:13:46.999
After his death...

951
01:13:47.301 --> 01:13:50.099
...the police will receive
a photograph of you...

952
01:13:50.338 --> 01:13:52.203
...handing over the briefcase.

953
01:13:52.273 --> 01:13:54.366
And will blame you for the crime.

954
01:13:55.409 --> 01:13:58.970
They'll believe it. 'cause they know
you're a big fan of Baynard's.

955
01:13:59.113 --> 01:14:00.444
Go fuck yourself.

956
01:14:01.615 --> 01:14:03.480
Now. that's not polite.

957
01:14:05.019 --> 01:14:07.214
lt's very abusive sounding.

958
01:14:08.723 --> 01:14:10.588
What would you do...

959
01:14:11.058 --> 01:14:14.084
...if somebody told you
to go fuck yourself?

960
01:14:16.864 --> 01:14:19.662
Would you cut one of their eyes out?

961
01:14:23.070 --> 01:14:24.503
What would you do?

962
01:14:33.014 --> 01:14:35.414
You think you're so fucking cool.

963
01:14:36.017 --> 01:14:38.349
You think you're so fucking cool.

964
01:14:39.020 --> 01:14:40.612
But this once...

965
01:14:41.122 --> 01:14:43.249
...l'd like to hear you scream...

966
01:14:43.457 --> 01:14:44.924
...in pain.

967
01:14:48.429 --> 01:14:50.192
Play some rap music.

968
01:15:04.111 --> 01:15:05.203
Hey. Flash.

969
01:15:05.713 --> 01:15:07.078
Rescue attempt?

970
01:15:07.214 --> 01:15:08.408
Blow me.

971
01:15:08.682 --> 01:15:10.343
You must be James.

972
01:15:11.318 --> 01:15:13.149
He does that with everybody.

973
01:15:13.287 --> 01:15:14.652
Calls me Joseph.

974
01:15:14.755 --> 01:15:16.086
l trust you're alone?

975
01:15:16.157 --> 01:15:18.682
No. l got the fucking
Vienna Boys Choir with me.

976
01:15:18.759 --> 01:15:20.556
ls everybody stupid around here?

977
01:15:22.897 --> 01:15:23.955
Just you.

978
01:15:24.031 --> 01:15:25.828
Shoot them and bury them.

979
01:15:28.235 --> 01:15:29.224
Scared?

980
01:15:29.336 --> 01:15:31.065
Shitless. You?

981
01:15:31.238 --> 01:15:32.432
More or less.

982
01:15:40.147 --> 01:15:41.273
Hey. mister?

983
01:15:41.649 --> 01:15:43.173
Do you like my puppet?

984
01:15:43.517 --> 01:15:44.814
Get this kid out of here.

985
01:15:44.885 --> 01:15:46.978
My name is Furry Tom.

986
01:15:47.188 --> 01:15:48.746
l said. get out of here. kid.

987
01:15:48.923 --> 01:15:50.185
Kid stays.

988
01:15:50.925 --> 01:15:52.552
Can you make him talk?

989
01:15:56.430 --> 01:15:58.193
Go on. Try.

990
01:16:02.269 --> 01:16:03.759
Go ahead. Take it.

991
01:16:09.844 --> 01:16:11.209
lt's riddle time.

992
01:16:11.479 --> 01:16:14.209
Why did Mr. Milo cross the road?

993
01:16:16.717 --> 01:16:18.344
l don't know. Why?

994
01:16:18.419 --> 01:16:21.445
Because his dick was stuck in a chicken.

995
01:16:30.131 --> 01:16:31.359
Fur ball?

996
01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:36.401
This is probably the first pussy
a lot of you have seen in a long time.

997
01:16:36.537 --> 01:16:38.300
Especially this fat fuck.

998
01:16:38.806 --> 01:16:40.171
Where'd you get the suit?

999
01:16:40.374 --> 01:16:41.966
Gangsters 'R' Us?

1000
01:16:47.248 --> 01:16:48.579
Get out of here!

1001
01:17:07.501 --> 01:17:10.766
-What is she doing here?
-l followed him. lt's not his fault!

1002
01:17:11.906 --> 01:17:13.203
l'll kill you both!

1003
01:17:13.274 --> 01:17:15.242
But you'll have to get in line.

1004
01:17:22.049 --> 01:17:24.347
-Here. Take this.
-What do l do with it?

1005
01:17:24.418 --> 01:17:26.579
Point it at the bad guys and shoot!

1006
01:17:30.424 --> 01:17:31.891
Keep your head down!

1007
01:17:38.532 --> 01:17:41.160
-Any more bright ideas?
-We'll go real fast!

1008
01:17:41.235 --> 01:17:42.395
Good idea!

1009
01:17:51.946 --> 01:17:54.710
Push this fuck off the road. man!

1010
01:17:57.718 --> 01:17:59.151
Hang on!

1011
01:18:06.594 --> 01:18:08.391
Put your seat belts on!

1012
01:18:08.929 --> 01:18:10.191
This is bad!

1013
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.160
Very bad!

1014
01:18:29.250 --> 01:18:30.945
You all right? Let's go.

1015
01:18:59.079 --> 01:19:01.047
Any chance they're still alive?

1016
01:19:03.450 --> 01:19:05.111
Not now.

1017
01:19:05.486 --> 01:19:06.783
Call the cops!

1018
01:19:06.887 --> 01:19:10.050
Tell them there's a bomb at the Coliseum!
Senator Baynard's in danger!

1019
01:19:10.157 --> 01:19:11.146
You got it?

1020
01:19:14.928 --> 01:19:17.761
Happy birthday.
Buy yourself a new pair of pants.

1021
01:19:17.931 --> 01:19:20.024
We got to get that bomb
before it gets to Baynard.

1022
01:19:20.134 --> 01:19:21.396
Got a car?

1023
01:19:22.169 --> 01:19:24.501
-Do you have a car?
-Give me the keys.

1024
01:19:24.638 --> 01:19:25.570
No way.

1025
01:19:25.673 --> 01:19:27.800
Give me the keys or l shoot the kid.

1026
01:19:27.875 --> 01:19:29.206
Daddy!

1027
01:19:33.914 --> 01:19:35.745
All right. Come on. let's go.

1028
01:19:37.418 --> 01:19:40.251
-You're the dumbest guy in the world.
-Why?

1029
01:19:40.321 --> 01:19:42.812
'Cause you're trying to save the guy
that ruined your career...

1030
01:19:42.890 --> 01:19:45.552
...and avenge the death of the guy
that fucked your wife.

1031
01:19:46.193 --> 01:19:48.753
The girl said her dad's name
is Joe Hollenbrooker.

1032
01:19:48.929 --> 01:19:50.829
-What is it?
-Hallenbeck.

1033
01:19:50.964 --> 01:19:53.194
He stole my car and said
he's going to the Coliseum.

1034
01:19:56.970 --> 01:20:00.462
He stole my car. He set my pool on fire.
The man is a lunatic!

1035
01:20:05.946 --> 01:20:09.507
Give me ten black-and-whites.
He's going to the Coliseum.

1036
01:20:17.624 --> 01:20:20.320
lf we go any faster.
we'll travel back in time.

1037
01:20:24.865 --> 01:20:26.127
There.

1038
01:20:27.634 --> 01:20:29.864
You pull up and l'll yell at them.

1039
01:20:30.304 --> 01:20:34.172
-Pull up next to them and l'll yell at them.
-That's the lamest plan l've ever heard!

1040
01:20:34.241 --> 01:20:37.733
-Can we try?
-Bulletproof glass. They won't hear you.

1041
01:20:41.181 --> 01:20:43.308
-What are you doing?
-Drawing them a picture.

1042
01:20:43.384 --> 01:20:44.578
-What is that?
-A bomb.

1043
01:20:44.651 --> 01:20:49.611
Looks like an apple with lines saying.
''Don't open the briefcase. it's full of fruit.''

1044
01:20:49.723 --> 01:20:51.520
You want to draw it?

1045
01:21:02.836 --> 01:21:04.736
-Happy?
-Bom.

1046
01:21:04.838 --> 01:21:06.271
Are you kidding me?

1047
01:21:09.843 --> 01:21:12.368
Always criticizing. l can't do nothing right.

1048
01:21:17.217 --> 01:21:18.548
l forgot to tell you.

1049
01:21:18.619 --> 01:21:22.521
-''Bom'' is ''fuck you'' in Polish.
-lt's not funny. l almost bought it.

1050
01:21:22.589 --> 01:21:24.750
Tragic loss to the art world.

1051
01:21:25.726 --> 01:21:27.057
You'll lose them.

1052
01:21:27.127 --> 01:21:28.685
Buckle your seat belt.

1053
01:21:28.762 --> 01:21:30.093
lt's not working!

1054
01:21:44.645 --> 01:21:48.376
l swear to Christ. if l survive this case.
l'll dance a jig.

1055
01:21:49.383 --> 01:21:50.941
l will dance a jig.

1056
01:21:51.051 --> 01:21:52.143
There! There!

1057
01:21:52.219 --> 01:21:54.847
On the off-ramp we just passed!

1058
01:22:02.463 --> 01:22:05.296
Where you going? Where you going?

1059
01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:47.971
Ain't l a bitch?

1060
01:22:48.575 --> 01:22:50.338
Now do we go to the cops?

1061
01:22:50.477 --> 01:22:51.808
l'll think about it.

1062
01:23:00.921 --> 01:23:02.286
Expecting a call?

1063
01:23:06.226 --> 01:23:08.319
Hey. motherfucker.

1064
01:23:08.929 --> 01:23:12.490
-Where are you? Bottom of the pool?
-On my way to the ball game.

1065
01:23:13.166 --> 01:23:15.532
Someone here wants to talk to you.

1066
01:23:16.603 --> 01:23:18.366
Hi. Daddy.

1067
01:23:18.772 --> 01:23:20.899
I'm okay. I'm not hurt.

1068
01:23:23.744 --> 01:23:25.405
You back off...

1069
01:23:25.479 --> 01:23:28.380
...or l'll show your daughter
what a hot date l am.

1070
01:23:32.185 --> 01:23:35.154
-What happened?
-He's taken Darian.

1071
01:23:36.223 --> 01:23:37.520
What do we do?

1072
01:23:38.225 --> 01:23:39.817
We take Marcone.

1073
01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:43.186
lt's the only way. lf we do nothing.
they'll kill her anyway.

1074
01:23:43.263 --> 01:23:46.164
Careful with that case.
lt's the one that goes ''bang.''

1075
01:23:47.534 --> 01:23:49.058
Look at all this.

1076
01:23:51.405 --> 01:23:52.497
Shredders.

1077
01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:55.306
Police and the DEA use it to blow locks.

1078
01:23:55.375 --> 01:23:57.070
They explode on impact.

1079
01:23:57.177 --> 01:23:59.839
Kill everything within a ten-foot radius.

1080
01:24:01.381 --> 01:24:04.214
Put this on. Get in. You in or out?

1081
01:24:04.284 --> 01:24:06.684
l guess l'm in. What have l got to lose?

1082
01:24:07.187 --> 01:24:08.848
We're going to a ball game.

1083
01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:22.694
THlS SPACE RESERVED FOR S. MARCONE

1084
01:24:26.473 --> 01:24:27.997
That's Marcone's car.

1085
01:24:28.075 --> 01:24:29.440
Come on.

1086
01:24:30.077 --> 01:24:32.409
-Always wanted to do that.
-Should've shit on it.

1087
01:24:45.626 --> 01:24:48.891
Shit. l forgot to tell you
you're wanted for murder.

1088
01:24:54.267 --> 01:24:56.360
Mr. Dix. long time no see.

1089
01:24:56.470 --> 01:24:58.233
Yeah. too long.

1090
01:24:58.305 --> 01:24:59.932
We're going to see Mr. Marcone.

1091
01:25:00.007 --> 01:25:01.838
Sure. go ahead.

1092
01:25:12.285 --> 01:25:13.912
Jimmy Dix. you bastard!

1093
01:25:14.021 --> 01:25:16.489
You broke my nose!
What are you doing here?

1094
01:25:16.556 --> 01:25:19.252
You were banned!
You were kicked off the team!

1095
01:25:19.526 --> 01:25:22.427
How'd you like to be kicked off the planet?

1096
01:25:22.829 --> 01:25:24.990
Have a nice game.

1097
01:25:30.337 --> 01:25:32.396
AUTHORlZED PERSONNEL ONLY

1098
01:25:46.653 --> 01:25:48.177
How you doin'?

1099
01:25:48.388 --> 01:25:50.754
You are one dumb son of a bitch.

1100
01:25:52.125 --> 01:25:53.524
You know that?

1101
01:25:53.593 --> 01:25:56.118
l guess we won't dance that jig.

1102
01:25:58.799 --> 01:25:59.788
You okay?

1103
01:25:59.900 --> 01:26:03.529
Of course she is all right.
She's been with her Uncle Shelly.

1104
01:26:03.804 --> 01:26:05.294
Yeah. l'm okay. Dad.

1105
01:26:05.872 --> 01:26:07.464
Loose the guns.

1106
01:26:07.541 --> 01:26:09.372
Take off your coats. Relax.

1107
01:26:09.609 --> 01:26:13.773
Give up. What do you think Baynard'll do
when he finds out you tried to kill him?

1108
01:26:13.847 --> 01:26:15.974
He doesn't have a chance.

1109
01:26:16.183 --> 01:26:21.143
Pretty shortly. Milo will have him between
the crosses of a high-powered rifle.

1110
01:26:21.688 --> 01:26:23.713
Where's old Milo shooting from?

1111
01:26:24.758 --> 01:26:27.522
You just never run out of questions.

1112
01:26:28.028 --> 01:26:29.461
Let's just say...

1113
01:26:29.563 --> 01:26:32.259
...Milo's in a highly enlightened position.

1114
01:26:33.333 --> 01:26:34.800
Why'd you kill Cory?

1115
01:26:36.703 --> 01:26:39.729
She took to blackmail.
l have no truck with that.

1116
01:26:39.940 --> 01:26:43.000
She's one of the sweetest little whores
l ever tasted.

1117
01:26:43.477 --> 01:26:46.173
There's five feet of marble
between me and you.

1118
01:26:46.246 --> 01:26:48.578
Maybe l make it. maybe l don't.

1119
01:26:48.749 --> 01:26:51.343
You call her ''whore'' again.
l'm gonna find out.

1120
01:26:55.021 --> 01:26:56.579
Do what you got to do.

1121
01:26:56.656 --> 01:26:58.021
Take it easy.

1122
01:26:58.925 --> 01:27:00.415
He should know.

1123
01:27:00.494 --> 01:27:03.156
With a face like that.
he's got to be paying for it.

1124
01:27:03.230 --> 01:27:05.698
lf you're fond of this little girl...

1125
01:27:06.399 --> 01:27:08.526
...you'll keep your goddamn mouth shut!

1126
01:27:08.602 --> 01:27:10.763
Eat shit. you fucking redneck!

1127
01:27:11.138 --> 01:27:12.366
Come here.

1128
01:27:13.907 --> 01:27:16.705
Goddamn.
l'm really glad to see you. Jimmy.

1129
01:27:18.111 --> 01:27:21.808
l still have that autographed ball
you gave me for my collection.

1130
01:27:24.184 --> 01:27:25.651
lt's a shame about you.

1131
01:27:25.719 --> 01:27:28.017
You had the million-dollar arm. kiddo.

1132
01:27:28.088 --> 01:27:29.612
You got hooked on...

1133
01:27:30.524 --> 01:27:31.889
...was it...

1134
01:27:32.292 --> 01:27:33.589
...Demerol!

1135
01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:36.888
'Cause you couldn't stand the pain.
You hated the pain.

1136
01:27:40.167 --> 01:27:41.759
Couldn't take the pain.

1137
01:27:43.670 --> 01:27:45.069
Life is pain.

1138
01:27:50.277 --> 01:27:51.676
Walk it off. son.

1139
01:27:52.078 --> 01:27:53.409
Discipline.

1140
01:27:53.713 --> 01:27:54.907
Oh. God!

1141
01:27:55.715 --> 01:27:59.014
Kids nowadays
just don't have no discipline.

1142
01:28:01.154 --> 01:28:02.644
Don't you cry. honey.

1143
01:28:05.325 --> 01:28:06.383
Come on.

1144
01:28:06.459 --> 01:28:08.427
Sit in Uncle Shelly's chair.

1145
01:28:09.196 --> 01:28:10.527
Let the girl go.

1146
01:28:17.571 --> 01:28:19.436
Put them out of my misery.

1147
01:28:20.140 --> 01:28:22.438
There is the matter of the $6 million.

1148
01:28:23.710 --> 01:28:25.610
Unless you're not interested.

1149
01:28:26.313 --> 01:28:28.110
Let's humor this asshole.

1150
01:28:28.348 --> 01:28:29.781
Tell me about it.

1151
01:28:31.585 --> 01:28:33.951
Just me and Flash know where it is.

1152
01:28:36.122 --> 01:28:38.113
lt's in the back of a white BMW.

1153
01:28:39.926 --> 01:28:41.484
We can take you to it.

1154
01:28:41.561 --> 01:28:43.791
Milo told me the money was destroyed.

1155
01:28:45.432 --> 01:28:46.956
You're bluffing.

1156
01:28:47.434 --> 01:28:48.867
Think l'm bluffing?

1157
01:28:49.603 --> 01:28:52.299
l also have in my possession
a certain tape.

1158
01:28:52.372 --> 01:28:54.363
You and Senator Baynard.

1159
01:28:54.741 --> 01:28:56.072
Very juicy stuff.

1160
01:28:56.142 --> 01:28:58.042
Well. now. just let me guess.

1161
01:28:59.246 --> 01:29:01.146
lf something happens to you...

1162
01:29:02.082 --> 01:29:04.812
...that thing will be mailed to the cops.

1163
01:29:04.951 --> 01:29:07.351
Close. Actually. it goes to the mob.

1164
01:29:09.122 --> 01:29:11.886
They'd be very interested to know
what you're up to.

1165
01:29:12.859 --> 01:29:14.326
Legalized gambling.

1166
01:29:15.328 --> 01:29:17.558
Hell. they stand to lose what? Two?

1167
01:29:17.797 --> 01:29:19.822
Two and a half billion dollars?

1168
01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:22.368
They won't be upset about that.

1169
01:29:22.736 --> 01:29:24.897
Just their entire bookmaking income.

1170
01:29:25.805 --> 01:29:27.739
Go ahead and pull the trigger.

1171
01:29:27.908 --> 01:29:29.034
Be my guest.

1172
01:29:29.442 --> 01:29:33.435
Just don't be surprised
if you wake up next to a stallion head....

1173
01:29:41.121 --> 01:29:44.352
lf you had that goddamn tape
you'd have already told me.

1174
01:29:47.060 --> 01:29:48.687
This ain't working.

1175
01:29:48.762 --> 01:29:51.128
Try something else. Take your best shot.

1176
01:29:51.598 --> 01:29:54.999
Fuck you. l ain't going out like that!
Mr. Marcone. he's lying!

1177
01:29:55.068 --> 01:29:58.037
-We have the money. but it ain't in the car.
-Shut up!

1178
01:29:58.271 --> 01:30:00.705
lt's in a locker! l got the key!

1179
01:30:01.174 --> 01:30:02.766
Where is the key?

1180
01:30:03.643 --> 01:30:05.611
l got it stashed in my shorts.

1181
01:30:06.246 --> 01:30:07.770
Easy. Just easy.

1182
01:30:10.350 --> 01:30:14.218
-Don't give it to him. He'll kill you!
-He'll kill us anyway. asshole!

1183
01:30:17.958 --> 01:30:19.585
You have to promise to let me go.

1184
01:30:19.659 --> 01:30:21.388
Bullshit.

1185
01:30:21.594 --> 01:30:24.119
Give him the key
or l'll have you kneecapped.

1186
01:30:28.001 --> 01:30:31.493
Look's like nobody gets the money.
lt's one of those new plastic keys.

1187
01:30:31.571 --> 01:30:33.095
Get the goddamned key!

1188
01:30:33.173 --> 01:30:34.333
The kind that shreds.

1189
01:30:34.407 --> 01:30:35.874
Darian. get down.

1190
01:30:41.781 --> 01:30:43.248
Get her out!

1191
01:31:04.571 --> 01:31:05.765
l can't walk.

1192
01:31:05.839 --> 01:31:07.807
You all right? You gonna pass out?

1193
01:31:07.874 --> 01:31:09.273
l'm gonna make it.

1194
01:31:11.978 --> 01:31:12.967
Here.

1195
01:31:13.079 --> 01:31:14.910
Plastic keys? The kind that shred?

1196
01:31:14.981 --> 01:31:17.142
Short notice. Best l could do.

1197
01:31:17.250 --> 01:31:18.877
You did real good.

1198
01:31:19.285 --> 01:31:20.946
Learned from a pro.

1199
01:31:24.858 --> 01:31:26.849
Shit! You wasn't bluffing.

1200
01:31:42.575 --> 01:31:45.738
-Where's the senator's box?
-Section C. l'll show you.

1201
01:31:49.082 --> 01:31:50.982
Where's the senator's box?

1202
01:31:51.251 --> 01:31:52.183
There.

1203
01:31:54.487 --> 01:31:55.715
Where's Milo?

1204
01:32:03.663 --> 01:32:05.824
A highly enlightened position.

1205
01:32:07.100 --> 01:32:09.159
He's gotta be up on those lights.

1206
01:32:09.636 --> 01:32:12.036
Go find a cop and stay put. all right?

1207
01:32:12.505 --> 01:32:15.372
You hear me? Listen to Daddy. all right?

1208
01:32:15.742 --> 01:32:17.403
l'll be all right.

1209
01:32:17.610 --> 01:32:19.510
Do what l say. Give me a kiss.

1210
01:32:19.712 --> 01:32:21.873
Go. Go. Run. Go find a cop.

1211
01:32:22.048 --> 01:32:24.016
-What about me?
-Find Baynard.

1212
01:32:24.084 --> 01:32:25.381
Then what do l do?

1213
01:32:25.452 --> 01:32:26.817
Get his attention.

1214
01:32:37.497 --> 01:32:38.486
Freeze.

1215
01:32:38.565 --> 01:32:42.262
There's a sniper on that light!
He's gonna shoot Baynard!

1216
01:32:42.502 --> 01:32:43.764
Come on!

1217
01:33:11.498 --> 01:33:13.227
There he is! Jimmy Dix!

1218
01:33:14.467 --> 01:33:16.935
He pulled a gun on me. You scum!

1219
01:33:20.140 --> 01:33:23.132
He's got a shotgun!
You bastard! You fuck!

1220
01:33:38.358 --> 01:33:39.416
Sit down!

1221
01:33:51.070 --> 01:33:52.537
Give me the ball!

1222
01:33:52.639 --> 01:33:54.436
Give me the fucking ball!

1223
01:33:55.275 --> 01:33:56.367
Thank you.

1224
01:34:08.855 --> 01:34:10.379
l said. ''Sit down! ''

1225
01:34:57.637 --> 01:35:00.071
Put down your weapon!
You're under arrest!

1226
01:35:11.284 --> 01:35:12.308
Fuck!

1227
01:35:15.355 --> 01:35:16.845
Looking for this?

1228
01:35:20.426 --> 01:35:21.893
You fucking asshole!

1229
01:35:34.841 --> 01:35:36.035
l told you...

1230
01:35:36.276 --> 01:35:38.870
...if you ever touch me again. l'll kill you!

1231
01:35:43.383 --> 01:35:44.611
Not me!

1232
01:36:14.380 --> 01:36:16.371
What the hell is he doing?

1233
01:36:16.449 --> 01:36:18.883
l don't know. ls he dancing?

1234
01:36:21.421 --> 01:36:23.389
Looks like he's dancing.

1235
01:36:27.260 --> 01:36:29.888
For a dancer. he's one hell of a detective.

1236
01:36:42.642 --> 01:36:45.076
What's this l hear about Satan Claus?

1237
01:36:46.713 --> 01:36:47.907
You know about him too?

1238
01:36:47.980 --> 01:36:49.538
There! That's the man!

1239
01:36:49.649 --> 01:36:52.812
This bastard who's been making
the phone calls and harassing me!

1240
01:36:52.885 --> 01:36:56.082
l bet he stage-managed
the whole damn thing!

1241
01:36:57.423 --> 01:36:58.515
Arrest him!

1242
01:37:05.264 --> 01:37:06.492
Head or gut?

1243
01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:08.558
Excuse me?

1244
01:37:16.175 --> 01:37:17.369
Mom's here.

1245
01:37:19.278 --> 01:37:20.836
l need you so much.

1246
01:37:24.884 --> 01:37:27.182
You're a real bastard. you know that?

1247
01:37:28.688 --> 01:37:29.950
And then some.

1248
01:37:53.279 --> 01:37:54.541
l'm sorry.

1249
01:38:00.086 --> 01:38:01.713
l'm so sorry.

1250
01:38:06.325 --> 01:38:07.917
Please forgive me.

1251
01:38:17.503 --> 01:38:18.936
l'll buy a dog.

1252
01:38:32.018 --> 01:38:33.349
Fuck you. Sarah.

1253
01:38:51.170 --> 01:38:52.501
Fuck you. Sarah.

1254
01:38:53.873 --> 01:38:57.934
You're a lying bitch and if the cops
weren't here. l'd spit in your face.

1255
01:39:08.287 --> 01:39:11.222
Where's the briefcase
they were telling me about?

1256
01:39:12.792 --> 01:39:14.555
White BMW. Back seat.

1257
01:39:21.734 --> 01:39:23.326
Ain't a thing here.

1258
01:39:32.411 --> 01:39:33.537
Bingo.

1259
01:39:40.586 --> 01:39:42.577
Marcone's got the wrong one!

1260
01:40:03.776 --> 01:40:04.834
What?

1261
01:40:12.184 --> 01:40:13.947
So. what's next for us?

1262
01:40:15.855 --> 01:40:17.447
Tomorrow. l guess.

1263
01:40:18.357 --> 01:40:20.552
Just take it one step at a time.

1264
01:40:22.562 --> 01:40:24.962
Daddy. can l go show Jimmy
to my friends?

1265
01:40:26.132 --> 01:40:28.965
-He's not a puppy. honey.
-He's fucking famous.

1266
01:40:30.303 --> 01:40:31.861
You want to watch your mouth?

1267
01:40:31.938 --> 01:40:33.371
Come on. Dad.

1268
01:40:33.472 --> 01:40:36.566
Your father said. ''Watch your mouth.''
Now. do it!

1269
01:40:40.379 --> 01:40:41.368
Yes. sir.

1270
01:40:43.482 --> 01:40:44.813
l like that.

1271
01:40:49.021 --> 01:40:51.251
l'm thinking l could use a partner.

1272
01:40:52.091 --> 01:40:53.649
You up for that?

1273
01:40:53.893 --> 01:40:56.487
l don't know anything
about being a detective.

1274
01:40:56.662 --> 01:40:58.254
There's nothing to it.

1275
01:40:58.397 --> 01:41:01.924
This being the 90s. you can't just walk up
to a guy and smack him in the face.

1276
01:41:02.001 --> 01:41:04.026
You got to say something cool first.

1277
01:41:04.103 --> 01:41:06.003
Yeah. like. ''l'll be back.''

1278
01:41:06.105 --> 01:41:09.506
Only better than that. Like.
you hit him with a surfboard and say:

1279
01:41:09.575 --> 01:41:11.236
''Surf's up. pal! ''

1280
01:41:12.011 --> 01:41:13.501
Something like that.

1281
01:41:13.579 --> 01:41:15.012
So. what else?

1282
01:41:15.081 --> 01:41:16.912
There's not much more.

1283
01:41:17.149 --> 01:41:19.344
Water's wet. the sky is blue....

1284
01:41:19.485 --> 01:41:23.285
The old Satan Claus.
he's out there just getting stronger.

1285
01:41:23.689 --> 01:41:25.486
So. what do we do about that?

1286
01:41:25.558 --> 01:41:27.116
Be prepared. son.

1287
01:41:27.393 --> 01:41:29.623
That's my motto. Be prepared.
