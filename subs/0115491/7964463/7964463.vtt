Hey, that's a-no good.
What the wedding needs is a theme.

504
00:35:21.610 --> 00:35:24.979
- Needs a groom, too,
but let's work with what we have.
- Genie!

505
00:35:25.114 --> 00:35:28.814
[CHUCKLES]
It's a joke. I do that.

506
00:35:28.951 --> 00:35:32.616
Okay, let's see. This'll be
the second wedding for both of you.

507
00:35:32.746 --> 00:35:37.076
I'm thinking we need
something a little more simple,
a little more elegant and less grey.

508
00:35:37.209 --> 00:35:39.332
- [TRUMPETING]
- Did it, done it, own it.

509
00:35:39.461 --> 00:35:42.996
I'm gonna throw some colours at ya.
Mauve, teal and salmon.

510
00:35:43.132 --> 00:35:46.832
What do you like besides the salmon?
Okay, Madonna.

511
00:35:46.969 --> 00:35:50.754
Don't keep it.
Just put that in the mix. Wink. Okay.

512
00:35:50.891 --> 00:35:54.425
I see lasers!
It's a miracle!

513
00:35:54.561 --> 00:35:57.266
He believes! He believes!

514
00:35:57.397 --> 00:36:01.940
- [IMITATING ELVIS]
Thank you very much.
- [GIGGLES] I don't think so.

515
00:36:02.068 --> 00:36:04.108
Tres gauche, right?

516
00:36:05.822 --> 00:36:08.693
Hmm. Maybe you could elope.

517
00:36:08.825 --> 00:36:12.028
No, you "cantaloupe."
But, oh, "honeydew." [LAUGHING]

518
00:36:13.747 --> 00:36:17.198
I don't know whether to put it
under props or produce.

519
00:36:17.335 --> 00:36:20.869
Please, don't squeeze the tyres. They're
not ripe. And how about that gown?

520
00:36:21.005 --> 00:36:23.959
Whether you're dancing with dwarfs
or simply biting the apple,

521
00:36:24.091 --> 00:36:27.045
it says, "I'm a princess for now."

522
00:36:27.178 --> 00:36:30.511
- Uh, Genie.
- Hey, it's synergy.

523
00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:33.213
The marketing guys are very excited.
It tests really well.

524
00:36:33.351 --> 00:36:36.684
Thank you, Genie.
I'm sure it will be wonderful.

525
00:36:36.812 --> 00:36:40.810
- And thanks for cheering me up.
- [LAUGHS]

526
00:36:40.942 --> 00:36:45.022
I'm sure Ali Baba and the boy
are on the road to Agrabah right now.
Isn't that right, Bob?

527
00:36:45.154 --> 00:36:49.651
That's right, Bing. How 'bout
this town? Is it wild or what?

528
00:36:49.785 --> 00:36:52.323
It's like one giant sand trap
and me without my wedgie.

529
00:36:52.454 --> 00:36:55.538
Hey, let's give a big hand
for Brooke Shields.

530
00:36:57.918 --> 00:37:01.002
I find my son and lose my enemy.

531
00:37:01.129 --> 00:37:04.664
- You did your old man proud, Aladdin.
- I was just tryin' to stay alive.

532
00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:10.387
Ha! If you didn't fight,
you would've been killed.
So says the code of the Forty Thieves.

533
00:37:10.514 --> 00:37:14.132
Does this code have any rules
that don't end in death?

534
00:37:14.268 --> 00:37:16.676
It's a strict code.

535
00:37:16.813 --> 00:37:19.268
But there is one thing
that I added.

536
00:37:19.399 --> 00:37:21.438
We never hurt the innocent.

537
00:37:21.568 --> 00:37:26.526
Uh, for future reference, I'm as
innocent as the day I was hatched.

538
00:37:26.656 --> 00:37:28.530
Oh, brother!

539
00:37:29.951 --> 00:37:32.524
My men don't even know
about this place.

540
00:37:37.709 --> 00:37:39.452
Listen, boy.

541
00:37:39.586 --> 00:37:43.251
There is a treasure.
The ultimate treasure.

542
00:37:43.381 --> 00:37:46.751
Compared to this,
a pharaoh's tomb is a pauper's grave.

543
00:37:46.886 --> 00:37:49.803
- A sultan's fortune,
nothing but... lunch money.
- Ahhh.

544
00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:53.097
And I am this close to it.

545
00:37:53.225 --> 00:37:56.559
That's tantalizingly close.

546
00:37:56.687 --> 00:38:00.471
But it's on an island that is
never in the same place twice.

547
00:38:00.608 --> 00:38:02.481
The Vanishing Isle.

548
00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:04.935
That would be a problem.

549
00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:08.486
- What is this "ultimate" treasure?
- The big one, boy.

550
00:38:08.616 --> 00:38:11.652
The Hand of Midas.

551
00:38:11.785 --> 00:38:14.491
- It's just a myth.
- It's not a myth, boy!

552
00:38:15.665 --> 00:38:17.539
It was once right here.

553
00:38:17.667 --> 00:38:19.993
Look. There's your proof!

554
00:38:20.128 --> 00:38:23.829
From stern to stem,
every piece of rigging,

555
00:38:23.965 --> 00:38:28.177
every peg and board,
all of it... solid gold!

556
00:38:28.303 --> 00:38:30.177
Oooh.

557
00:38:30.305 --> 00:38:33.840
Adopt me, daddy-o!

558
00:38:33.975 --> 00:38:38.187
- Touched by the Hand of Midas.
- And sunk by it.

559
00:38:38.313 --> 00:38:42.098
Aah, you don't understand. You don't
know what it's like to have nothing.

560
00:38:42.235 --> 00:38:45.686
To stare up at the palace
and know you deserve more.

561
00:38:47.615 --> 00:38:49.489
To be called "street rat."

562
00:38:50.743 --> 00:38:52.819
Yes... I do.

563
00:38:52.954 --> 00:38:56.572
I knew exactly what I wanted
for my family: the best.

564
00:38:56.707 --> 00:38:59.198
I couldn't give up
and go back empty-handed.

565
00:38:59.335 --> 00:39:03.463
But the weeks turned into months,
and the months turned into years.

566
00:39:06.509 --> 00:39:08.964
I came back to Agrabah one night.

567
00:39:09.095 --> 00:39:13.307
But I couldn't find
my wife, or my son.

568
00:39:13.433 --> 00:39:17.763
I thought my family
was lost forever.

569
00:39:17.896 --> 00:39:23.235
At that moment, I would've traded
anything to get your mother back.

570
00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:25.234
[ALADDIN]
We never wanted gold.

571
00:39:25.362 --> 00:39:27.402
We wanted you.

572
00:39:28.657 --> 00:39:30.899
I wanted a father.
I still do.

573
00:39:31.034 --> 00:39:33.193
Come to my wedding.

574
00:39:33.328 --> 00:39:36.163
This time,
you have an invitation.

575
00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:38.911
Aladdin, I...
I just don't know.

576
00:39:39.042 --> 00:39:43.919
Dad, I'm not going back to Agrabah
until morning. At least think about it?

577
00:39:46.134 --> 00:39:51.010
[SIGHS] Aladdin may never understand,
but it just wouldn't work.

578
00:39:51.139 --> 00:39:53.262
I don't belong in his world.

579
00:39:53.391 --> 00:39:57.223
The Oracle doesn't belong
in his world either.

580
00:39:57.353 --> 00:40:01.268
It belongs in the hands of
two enterprising treasure hunters;

581
00:40:01.399 --> 00:40:03.855
you and me.

582
00:40:03.985 --> 00:40:07.568
The Oracle!
It's probably just another dead end.

583
00:40:07.697 --> 00:40:11.114
It works!
That's how the kid found you!

584
00:40:11.243 --> 00:40:14.861
- It knows everything!
- Everything?

585
00:40:14.997 --> 00:40:17.203
And I know where
they stashed it.

586
00:40:17.333 --> 00:40:20.203
Cassim, we are talking about...

587
00:40:20.336 --> 00:40:23.502
the wedding of your only son.

588
00:40:23.631 --> 00:40:27.675
It's a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

589
00:40:27.801 --> 00:40:31.052
How can I pass it up?

590
00:40:36.602 --> 00:40:40.054
- [SA'LUK WHISPERING]
Captain, over here.
- Show yourself!

591
00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:42.811
You're alone. Good.

592
00:40:42.943 --> 00:40:47.071
Hmm. So you are the one with information
about the Forty Thieves?

593
00:40:47.197 --> 00:40:49.106
What would you say...

594
00:40:49.241 --> 00:40:52.989
if I handed you
the King of Thieves?

595
00:40:53.119 --> 00:40:55.990
I'd say,
"What's in it for you?"

596
00:40:56.122 --> 00:41:00.167
I'll just sleep better knowing
that he's off the streets...

597
00:41:00.293 --> 00:41:02.500
and on the executioner's block.

598
00:41:02.629 --> 00:41:06.877
Everyone knows that
the King of Thieves cannot be caught.

599
00:41:07.009 --> 00:41:09.335
What miracle do you possess?

600
00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:13.598
Two words that will make you
Agrabah's greatest hero:

601
00:41:13.724 --> 00:41:16.262
Open sesame.

602
00:41:20.398 --> 00:41:22.723
- Hop on, Dad.
- Oh, no.

603
00:41:22.859 --> 00:41:27.188
It's a rug. You sweep dirt under it.
You don't fly on it. At least, I don't.

604
00:41:27.321 --> 00:41:30.406
- [ALADDIN] Don't be afraid. It's fun.
- I am not afraid!

605
00:41:30.533 --> 00:41:33.024
Now, get off that thing
before you break your neck!

606
00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:35.237
I trust Carpet with my life.

607
00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:38.367
Give him time.
He'll come around.

608
00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:40.576
We'll take horses.

609
00:41:40.711 --> 00:41:45.538
Horses were good enough for my father,
and his father before him.

610
00:41:45.674 --> 00:41:48.165
And they were always
good enough for me.

611
00:41:48.302 --> 00:41:50.875
- He sounds like a father, all right.
- Uh-huh!

612
00:41:54.349 --> 00:41:57.553
Whoa! This is the spot, men.

613
00:41:58.770 --> 00:42:00.977
But there is nothing here.

614
00:42:01.106 --> 00:42:03.265
Now... but watch.

615
00:42:05.528 --> 00:42:07.687
Open... caraway!

616
00:42:13.453 --> 00:42:15.327
There is still nothing here.

617
00:42:15.455 --> 00:42:18.871
When I get a hold
of that no good...

618
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.579
- But I thought you said
it was "open sesame."

Genie? You have a genie?
Have you used all three wishes yet?

622
00:42:45.236 --> 00:42:49.185
Oh, please! Don't go into it.
It's just too painful.

623
00:42:49.323 --> 00:42:53.487
Oh, Al, you're back!
And your front! You're both here.

- That's great, Genie.
- Security's tight.

625
00:42:55.663 --> 00:42:59.079
- No big crowd. Immediate family only.
- Perfect. Because this is my...

No lowlifes this time, other than
the parrot, of course. Observe!

- Prepare to be vaporized. Thank you.

get within an inch of your wedding.

- I just wanna know one thing:
- Yeah?

00:44:25.005 --> 00:44:27.840
Will you be havin'
the chicken or the sea bass?

00:44:27.966 --> 00:44:31.217
Come on, Dad. I can't wait for you
to meet Jasmine and the Sultan.

Ahem, Al.
Don't you think we oughta lose...

- the Agrabah's Most Wanted look?
- What's wrong with the way I look?

the King of Thieves; you're my dad.
