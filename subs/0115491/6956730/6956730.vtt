00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:39.600
Did it, done it, own it.

522
00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:43.040
I'm gonna throw some colors at you.
Mauve, teal, and salmon.

523
00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:44.720
What do you like besides the salmon?

524
00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.120
Okay, Madonna!

525
00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:50.520
Don't keep it. Just put that in the mix.
Wink. Okay.

526
00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:53.280
I see lasers! It's a miracle!

528
00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:57.760
He believes! He believes!

529
00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:59.080
Thank you very much.

530
00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:01.080
(LAUGHS) I don't think so.

531
00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:03.800
<i>Très gauche,</i> right?

532
00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:07.240
Hmm...

533
00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.720
Maybe you could elope.

534
00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:10.600
No, you cantaloupe.
But, oh, honeydew!

535
00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:11.760
(LAUGHS)

536
00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:16.400
I don't know whether
to put it under props or produce.

537
00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:18.760
Please don't squeeze the tires.
They're not ripe.

538
00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.560
And how about that gown?

539
00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:24.040
Whether you're dancing with dwarfs,
or simply biting the apple,

540
00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:26.800
it says, "I'm a princess for now."

541
00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:30.280
-Genie.
-Hey, it's synergy.

542
00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:33.240
The marketing guys are very excited.
It tests really well.

543
00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:36.720
Thank you, Genie.
I'm sure it will be wonderful.

544
00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:39.600
And thanks for cheering me up.

545
00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:40.800

546
00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:42.400
(IMITATING BING CROSBY)
I'm sure Ali Baba and the boy

547
00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:43.960
are on the road to Agrabah right now.

548
00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:45.280
Isn't that right, Bob?

549
00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:46.760
(IMITATING BOB HOPE)
That's right, Bing.

550
00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:49.760
How about this town? Is it wild or what?

551
00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:52.640
It's like one giant sand trap,
and me without my wedgie.

552
00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:54.800
Hey, let's give a big hand
for Brooke Shields.

553
00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:01.120
CASSIM: I find my son
and lose my enemy.

554
00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:03.320
You did your old man proud, Aladdin.

555
00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:04.920
I was just trying to stay alive.

556
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.920
Huh! If you didn't fight,
you would've been killed.

557
00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:10.320
So says the code of the Forty Thieves.

558
00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:14.320
Does this code have any rules
that don't end in death?

559
00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:16.000
It's a strict code.

560
00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:19.440
But there is one thing that I added.

561
00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:21.320
We never hurt the innocent.

562
00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:23.520
Uh, for future reference,

563
00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:27.200
I'm as innocent
as the day I was hatched.

564
00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:28.800
Oh, brother!

565
00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.800
My men don't even know
about this place.

566
00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:40.800
Listen, boy, there is a treasure,

567
00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:42.880
the ultimate treasure.

568
00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:46.840
Compared to this,
a pharaoh's tomb is a pauper's grave,

569
00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.840
a sultan's fortune
nothing but lunch money.

570
00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:53.200
And I am this close to it.

571
00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:56.480
That's tantalizingly close.

572
00:37:56.520 --> 00:38:00.080
But it's on an island
that is never in the same place twice.

573
00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:02.680
The Vanishing Isle.

574
00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:04.720
That would be a problem.

575
00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:08.520
-What is this ultimate treasure?
-The big one, boy.

576
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.880
The Hand of Midas.

577
00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:14.360
-It's just a myth.
-It's not a myth, boy!

578
00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:19.360
It was once right here.
Look, there's your proof.

579
00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:22.120
From stern to stem,
every piece of rigging,

580
00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.200
(GASPS)

581
00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:28.040
every peg and board, all of it,
solid gold!

583
00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:33.320
Adopt me, daddy-o!

584
00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:38.040
-Touched by the Hand of Midas.
-And sunk by it.

585
00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:40.080
You don't understand.

586
00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:42.240
You don't know
what it's like to have nothing,

587
00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:45.520
to stare up at the palace
and know you deserve more,

588
00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:49.520
to be called "street rat."

589
00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:52.880
Yes, I do.

590
00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:56.400
I knew exactly
what I wanted for my family, the best.

591
00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:59.440
I couldn't give up,
and go back empty-handed.

592
00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:03.680
But the weeks turned into months
and the months turned into years.

593
00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:08.560
I came back to Agrabah one night,

594
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.440
but I couldn't find my wife, or my son.

595
00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:15.920
I thought my family was lost forever.

596
00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:22.600
At that moment, I would've traded
anything to get your mother back.

597
00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:25.080
ALADDIN: We never wanted gold.

598
00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:27.200
We wanted you.

599
00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:30.960
I wanted a father. I still do.

600
00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:33.120
Come to my wedding.

601
00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:35.600
This time, you have an invitation.

602
00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:38.760
Aladdin, I just don't know.

603
00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:41.360
Dad, I'm not going back
to Agrabah until morning.

604
00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:43.720
At least think about it?

605
00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:47.040
(SIGHS)

606
00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:50.320
Aladdin may never understand,
but it just wouldn't work.

607
00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:53.120
I don't belong in his world.

608
00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:57.160
The oracle doesn't belong
in his world, either.

609
00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:01.160
It belongs in the hands
of two enterprising treasure hunters,

610
00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:03.400
you and me.

611
00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:07.280
The oracle.
It's probably just another dead end.

612
00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:11.160
It works! That's how the kid found you.

613
00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:14.840
-It knows everything.
-Everything?

614
00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:17.400
And I know where they stashed it.

615
00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:23.240
Cassim, we are talking about
the wedding of your only son.

616
00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:27.680
It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

617
00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:30.480
How can I pass it up?

618
00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:38.760
SA'LUK: Captain, over here.

619
00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:40.280
Show yourself!

620
00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:42.880
You're alone. Good.

621
00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:47.280
So you are the one with information
about the Forty Thieves?

622
00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:52.880
What would you say if I handed you
the King of Thieves?

623
00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:55.880
I'd say, "What's in it for you?"

624
00:40:56.440 --> 00:41:00.200
I'll just sleep better knowing
that he's off the streets

625
00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:02.560
and on the executioner's block.

626
00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:06.560
Everyone knows that
the King of Thieves cannot be caught.

627
00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:09.160
What miracle do you possess?

628
00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:13.400
Two words that will make you
Agrabah's greatest hero.

629
00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:16.000
"Open sesame."

630
00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:22.680
-Hop on, Dad.
-Oh, no.

631
00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:27.200
It's a rug. You sweep dirt under it.
You don't fly on it. At least I don't.

632
00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:28.920
Don't be afraid. It's fun.

633
00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.520
I am not afraid!

634
00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:33.160
Now get off that thing
before you break your neck.

635
00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:34.720
(CHUCKLES) I trust Carpet with my life.

636
00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.400
Give him time. He'll come around.

637
00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:40.320
We'll take horses.

638
00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:44.760
Horses were good enough for my father
and his father before him,

639
00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:48.040
and they were always good enough
for me.

640
00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:49.920
He sounds like a father, all right.

641
00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:51.080
Uh-huh.

642
00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:55.720
Whoa!

643
00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:57.760
This is the spot, men.

644
00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:01.760
-But there is nothing here.
-Now.

645
00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:03.760
But watch.

646
00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:07.600
Open caraway!

647
00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:15.600
There is still nothing here.

648
00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:18.880
When I get a hold of that no-good...

649
00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:22.800
But I thought you said
it was "open sesame."

You have a genie?
Have you used all three wishes yet?

-Perfect, because this is my...

other than the parrot, of course.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.080
Come on, Dad.

693
00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:31.160
I can't wait for you to meet Jasmine
and the Sultan.

694
00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:35.560
Al, don't you think we ought to lose
the "Agrabah's Most Wanted" look?

695
00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:37.400
What's wrong with the way I look?

696
00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:40.160
When you're here,
you're not the King of Thieves.

697
00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:41.600
You're my dad.

698
00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:45.560
Hmm. I had more practice
being the King of Thieves.

699
00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:48.920
Oh, come on. Enough of this dark past.

700
00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:51.360
Let's roll out something a little new.

(IMITATING ALBERT EINSTEIN)
<i>You can postulate paternal advice</i>

I see you're traveling
at the speed of light.

717
00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:41.960
That's the theory of relatives.

741
00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:55.480
My boy Aladdin must've been born
under a lucky star

742
00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:58.040
to find such a treasure.

743
00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:01.040
You are most definitely
Aladdin's father.

744
00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:03.040
And I have the DNA to prove it.

745
00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:06.560
It must have been dreadful,
trapped by the Forty Thieves.

746
00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:08.040
Uh-oh.

747
00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:10.080
I try to block out the memories.

748
00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:14.080
Say no more.
Not another word on the subject.

749
00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:17.760
Yes, let's turn our attention
to happier thoughts.

750
00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:21.240
-The blessed union of our children.
-(GRUNTS) Indeed.

751
00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:23.280
It worked, Genie. They love him.

752
00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:26.240
It was the hat. Nothing does
the trick like a smart <i>chapeau.</i>

753
00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:27.600
It's more than that.

754
00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:28.880
CASSIM: Ah! To be back
amongst civilized people.

755
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.280
-Back among family.
-All he needed was a second chance.

756
00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:33.440
CASSIM: It's a miracle.

757
00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:35.920
You'll pay for this!

758
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.240
-You sold us out!
-THIEF: My nose!

759
00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:40.600
He's not in there!

760
00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:43.640
You didn't capture the King of Thieves?

761
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.600
Because he was not at the hideout!

762
00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:49.200
He had to be there.
Where else would he be?

763
00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:51.320
Apologies, Captain Razoul.

764
00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:52.480
-What?
-What?

765
00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:56.640
The Sultan said he won't be able to
sentence your prisoners until tomorrow.

766
00:47:57.080 --> 00:48:00.320
What's more important
than sentencing my prisoners?

767
00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:02.080
Why, the wedding.

768
00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:05.400
Princess Jasmine and Aladdin
are finally getting married.

769
00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:08.720
Aladdin? You didn't capture Aladdin
with the others?

770
00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:11.600
Why would he be
with the Forty Thieves?

771
00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:16.400
Because his father
is the King of Thieves!

772
00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:22.240
Where can he be?
I do hope nothing's wrong.

773
00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:24.440
Perhaps we should dispatch
a search party?

774
00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:28.640
Now, Father, I'm sure he's on his way.

775
00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:30.800
Where is he?

776
00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:32.480
Hakuna matata.

777
00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:36.800
Whoa. I was having
an out-of-movie experience.

778
00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:38.760
My guess is he wants
to make an entrance.

779
00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:45.840
Here's the monkey's lock picks.

780
00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:47.840
You know how to use 'em?

781
00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:53.840
I promise you, bird,
after this I go straight.

782
00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:56.320
Straight to the dungeon.

783
00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:57.440
(SCREAMS)

784
00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:03.400
We've been expecting you.

785
00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:18.000
Do you think something is wrong?

786
00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:20.400
Genie, can you find him?

787
00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:21.800
I'll sniff him out.

788
00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:25.120
(SNIFFING)

789
00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:28.960
I need a scrap of his clothes,
or a lock of his hair, or a shoe.

790
00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:31.520
A shoe's good. (GASPS)

00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:35.320
-(BOTH GASP)
-(CHITTERING)

792
00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:37.760
Razoul, what is the meaning of this?

793
00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:41.160
Your Majesty,
meet the King of Thieves.

794
00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:44.000
-Dad!
-We seized him in the treasury.

795
00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:46.960
He was after this again.

796
00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:48.120
No.

797
00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:50.720
And this is his accomplice.

798
00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:52.960
Big misunderstanding!

799
00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:56.400
It's a slap on the wrist
and community service kind of thing.

800
00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:59.040
Now I know why you really came back.

801
00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:05.120
Your father is the leader
of the Forty Thieves?

802
00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:07.680
This is most... (MUMBLES)

803
00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:10.920
Aladdin, did you know?

804
00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:14.640
I thought I could change him.
I had to try.

805
00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:19.000
You can change my clothes, Aladdin.
You can't change who I am.

806
00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:23.080
And the law is crystal clear
on what we must now do.

807
00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:25.720
Father, isn't there another way?

808
00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:31.600
I'm afraid there is not.
Take the prisoners to the dungeon.

809
00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:33.000
Dungeon?

810
00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:34.160
For life.

811
00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:35.520
Life?

812
00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:41.240
There are some wishes
that even I can't make come true.

813
00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:49.360
The oracle was right.

814
00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:52.800
My dad was trapped
in the world of the Forty Thieves.

815
00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:54.560
Trapped by his own greed.

816
00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:56.800
I was so stupid to think
I could change him.

817
00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:59.480
Trying to show him
a better life wasn't stupid, Al.

818
00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:02.240
(MUTTERING) Leaving him alone
with the parrot, that was stupid.

819
00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:05.120
Everything was perfect
before he came into my life.

820
00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:08.080
I just want things the way they were.

821
00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:11.440
Genie, I need my father's clothes.

822
00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:15.320
(LAUGHS) Al, what,
did you wrap the turban too tight?

823
00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:19.000
Come on! Why you wanna dress
in the King of Thieves ensemble?

824
00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:23.160
Might I suggest something
that doesn't actually say, "Arrest me!"

825
00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:24.960
ALADDIN: It fits. Good.

826
00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:30.520
I'm seeing... I'm seeing nothing
for your future if you dress like this!

827
00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:32.840
I'm breaking my father
out of that dungeon.

828
00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:35.160
The guards will never know I was there.

829
00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:40.160
Tonight, the King of Thieves will
make his most miraculous escape ever.

830
00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:42.320
Out of my life!

831
00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:44.680
It's the cape talking, isn't it?

Since he's captured the King of
Thieves, there's no living with Razoul.

835
00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:16.040
Well, it wasn't exactly easy
living with him before.

-Why are you...
-We don't have much time.

you get out.

-Forget it.

He even sounds like me.

When the Sultan gives me my due,

I'll put the good word in for you,

GUARD 2: I heard him over there.

GUARD 1: Over there!
GUARD 3: There!

864
00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:13.600

Your Majesty!

You!

869
00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:30.680
Yes.

870
00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:35.640
Well, I guess I'll have
to settle for the Prince of Thieves.

871
00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:39.200
We shall see if the Sultan
wants you in his family now.

-Hurry, Son. We must move.

00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:12.080
Did we lose him?

877
00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:15.080
I don't know,
but I did lose my lunch back there.

878
00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:17.720
They won't be able to pick up our trail
till daylight.

879
00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:21.160
By then,
we'll be long gone from Agrabah.

880
00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:29.160
I'm sorry for what you lost.

881
00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:31.920
But you can't go back now.

882
00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.120
You know that. What are you doing?

883
00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:36.080
I'm not going with you.

884
00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:37.240
I can't.

885
00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:39.240
Well, you can't go back.

886
00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:42.120
The moment they saw your face,
your life in Agrabah was over.

887
00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:44.880
I have to go back. Jasmine is there.

888
00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:47.920
Kid, it's over. You're a criminal now.

889
00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:51.440
I won't do what he did. I won't run away.

890
00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:53.560
I never ran away
from anything in my life.

891
00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:55.880
You ran away from your family!

892
00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:58.640
I told you what happened.
What else could I do?

893
00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:00.000
What else can you do?

894
00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:03.440
The right thing.
You should take this back.

895
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.560
-CASSIM: You can't!
-I won't walk out on Jasmine.

897
00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:13.000
I'm your son, but I can't live your life.

898
00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:15.280
Al, they'll lock you up.

899
00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:17.640
If there's a punishment, I'll take it.

900
00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:19.120
So be it.

901
00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:21.200
We have the oracle!

902
00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:24.160
The treasure's just waiting for us.

903
00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:25.360
The oracle?

904
00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:28.320
I had nothing left to lose.

905
00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:30.600
Yes, you did.

906
00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:37.160
It was supposed to be
a father-son outing.

907
00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:40.800
-Go with him, Iago.
-What?

908
00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:43.000
You mean it? Really?

909
00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:44.440
Go.

910
00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:46.800
Good luck, kid.

CHUBS: From 40 thieves
down to seven.

What are we to do?

913
00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:05.840
How did they find us?
How did they learn the magic words?

915

Another raid?

916
00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.520
Not again.

917
00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:15.040
It is a good day to die.

918
00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:17.840
Or to come back from the dead.

Impossible!

00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:26.040
I'm a survivor, like all of you.

923
00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:28.480
No thanks to Cassim.

924

-The King?
-You saw him?

925
00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:32.520
What's he want us to do now?

926
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.760
He wants you to rot
in the palace dungeon.

927
00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:39.520
Bah! The King of Thieves
is loyal to the end.

928

-Ouch!
-Ouch!

930
00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:45.360
He betrayed you, sold you out.

931
00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:50.240
You have always hated the King.
Why should we believe you?

932
00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:53.880
How do you think
the guard got the magic words?

933
00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:57.000
He told him the magic words?

934
00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:58.880
-I don't believe it.
-I don't believe it.

935
00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:01.040
Me, neither.

936
00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:05.720
