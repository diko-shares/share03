So, Patrizia, uh, what...

191
00:15:45.236 --> 00:15:47.530
What exactly are your interests?

192
00:15:48.656 --> 00:15:51.575
-I'm a very social person.
-Oh, yeah.

193
00:15:51.659 --> 00:15:53.994
-[Patrizia] A people pleaser.
-Oh.

194
00:15:56.622 --> 00:15:59.542

And his business is?

198
00:16:11.262 --> 00:16:13.055
Ground transportation.

199
00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:19.520
Oh.

200
00:16:27.486 --> 00:16:30.948
Uh, Maurizio said you used to be an actor.

201
00:16:31.907 --> 00:16:34.034
Yes, I was.

202
00:16:34.118 --> 00:16:37.371
You may remember a film, The Ancestor?

203
00:16:40.833 --> 00:16:43.586
No, no, no, no, no. Of course.
You're too young.

204
00:16:43.669 --> 00:16:46.130
But sometimes on the TV,

205
00:16:46.213 --> 00:16:47.798
they play a movie, Tourist Train.

206
00:16:47.882 --> 00:16:49.717
Tourist Train sounds familiar.

207
00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:54.847

Maurizio D'Ancora.

208
00:16:56.765 --> 00:16:58.184

-Can I get an autograph?
-[Rodolfo] Oh, no, no, no.

211
00:17:04.982 --> 00:17:07.193
The only good thing
that came from my career

212
00:17:07.276 --> 00:17:10.487
was meeting Maurizio's mother.

213
00:17:10.571 --> 00:17:12.239
Now, she...

214
00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:14.617

216
00:17:19.663 --> 00:17:25.002
during a moment of silent remembrance,

217
00:17:25.085 --> 00:17:28.631
Maurizio noticed the priest
lighting candles

218
00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:34.053
and he began to sing "Happy Birthday."

219
00:17:35.304 --> 00:17:36.639
He turned

220
00:17:37.556 --> 00:17:40.809

222
00:17:42.937 --> 00:17:44.897

223

Tell me, where did you meet her?

235
00:18:56.677 --> 00:19:00.681
-I met her at a party.
-Party?

236
00:19:00.764 --> 00:19:03.642
Yeah, Luca Sarzana's house,
at the Palazzo Serbelloni.

Yes, I know where the Sarzanas live.

240
00:19:16.864 --> 00:19:21.201
who makes their fortune

241

242

into someone like you.

243
00:19:25.039 --> 00:19:27.666
Well, yes, Father,
but Patrizia is not like that.

244
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:32.296
Well, I had Franco
do a little investigation.

-It is an empire.
-Oh, oh!

-How many what?

Or how many trucks they have?

How about that?

374
00:29:33.396 --> 00:29:37.567
-Ah, Claudia. Buonasera.
-Good morning. Good morning, Mr. Aldo.

375

What's all--
What's all this Japanese bullshit?

I'm learning.

382
00:29:57.879 --> 00:30:00.215
You know, they are our best customers so...

383
00:30:01.341 --> 00:30:03.635
They're loyal. They're quiet.

384
00:30:04.386 --> 00:30:05.762
And they're rich.

385
00:30:05.845 --> 00:30:10.558
-[scoffs] One of your terrible ideas.
-Here it is.

386

-Gotemba.
-Gotemba?

387
00:30:14.521 --> 00:30:16.856
Yeah, near the foot of Mount Fuji.

388
00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:17.941
It's a mall.

389
00:30:18.024 --> 00:30:21.319
Ninety minutes by bus from Tokyo.

390
00:30:21.403 --> 00:30:23.488
It will be built in the spring.

-Come on!

394

No, Aldo. You and your profits.

395
00:30:31.746 --> 00:30:33.623
Come on, things are fine as they are.

396
00:30:33.707 --> 00:30:35.417
Gucci doesn't belong in a mall,

397
00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.877
it belongs in a-- in a museum. [coughing]

398
00:30:37.961 --> 00:30:41.464
A museum where it'll make no profit.

No.

00:30:44.509 --> 00:30:47.846
And Aldo, as long as we are 50-50,

402
00:30:47.929 --> 00:30:50.890

Oh, geez, I can't even say her name.

406
00:31:01.234 --> 00:31:02.902
Well, sooner or later, you will have to.

407

-No, no, no, no.
-Yes.

408
00:31:04.446 --> 00:31:06.239
Maurizio and |, history. History.

409
00:31:06.322 --> 00:31:07.824
-No, come on.
- I told you.

410
00:31:07.907 --> 00:31:09.617
You are old.

411
00:31:09.701 --> 00:31:12.328
Maurizio is your only son.

412
00:31:12.412 --> 00:31:14.330
He is your true legacy.

413

You don't bring him back into the fold...

414
00:31:16.249 --> 00:31:18.793
-Well, maybe--
-...I'm telling you,

415
00:31:18.877 --> 00:31:22.130
you'll only wind up being
a bitter and lonely old man.

416
00:31:22.213 --> 00:31:23.923
That's what happens to all of us.

417
00:31:24.007 --> 00:31:26.134
Time will tell, but...

418
00:31:26.217 --> 00:31:27.886
When did you last touch him?

419
00:31:27.969 --> 00:31:30.013
[laughs] When did you last hug him?

420
00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.557
You don't touch anybody.

421
00:31:33.475 --> 00:31:35.351
You used to touch every once in a while.

422
00:31:35.435 --> 00:31:37.645
Now you, what, touch yourself?

423
00:31:37.729 --> 00:31:39.856
You? You teaching me?

How's it going with your boy?

425
00:31:43.276 --> 00:31:46.905
-Hmm?
-Well, your son is a smart lawyer.

426
00:31:46.988 --> 00:31:48.740
Mine is an idiot.

427
00:31:48.823 --> 00:31:50.533
But he's my idiot.

428
00:31:50.617 --> 00:31:52.160
And I know how to deal with him.

429
00:31:52.869 --> 00:31:55.246
But you need to deal with your son.

-[scoffs]
-Yes.

00:31:57.540 --> 00:31:59.793
It's my birthday on Sunday.

432

-Yeah?
-We'll all be there.

433
00:32:02.962 --> 00:32:04.672
You should come.

434
00:32:08.384 --> 00:32:10.011

-Aldo Gucci.
-Aldo!

439
00:32:25.902 --> 00:32:27.946
I hope I'm not
Interrupting anything important.

440
00:32:28.029 --> 00:32:31.074
What could be more important
than a phone call from my new uncle?

| am truly sorry

442
00:32:34.494 --> 00:32:36.955

to your wedding.

We are celebrating
my birthday this weekend at my villa.

449
00:32:51.803 --> 00:32:54.681
And I think it would be
a perfect opportunity

450
00:32:54.764 --> 00:32:57.308
for you to come and meet the family.

-Your birthday, I would love that.

452

-How many candles is it?
-Seventy.

453
00:33:03.523 --> 00:33:06.317
They say it's the new 69.

454
00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:09.737
Well, I-- I can't speak for Maurizio.

455
00:33:09.821 --> 00:33:11.364
He's right here.

How's my little lawyer?

I'm fine. I'm fine.

Watch him play. Go! See that?

He's never in his life called me Papa.

498
00:35:41.597 --> 00:35:44.600
Patrizia, you should know

499
00:35:45.601 --> 00:35:48.980
that the Guccis were noble saddle makers

500
00:35:49.063 --> 00:35:50.606
to medieval courts.

501
00:35:51.441 --> 00:35:53.026
We have history

green and red webbings.

503

And, yes, they are expensive.

504
00:35:59.449 --> 00:36:02.118
But quality is remembered

505
00:36:02.201 --> 00:36:05.121
long after price is forgotten.

506
00:36:05.204 --> 00:36:06.914
-Huh?

507
00:36:06.998 --> 00:36:09.542
Thoughts on Paolo's outfit, Domenico?

508
00:36:09.625 --> 00:36:11.461
You're the fashionista.

509
00:36:11.544 --> 00:36:14.881
It's eccentric.

| designed this myself.

511
00:36:17.508 --> 00:36:23.014
Well, you should reconsider
your wardrobe choices, Paolo.

512
00:36:23.097 --> 00:36:26.142
You are Gucci. You need to dress the part.

513
00:36:26.225 --> 00:36:28.227
It's chic.

514
00:36:29.228 --> 00:36:33.191
My father's problem is
he's stuck in the past.

515
00:36:33.274 --> 00:36:37.070
He refuses to take Gucci
into the next century.

516
00:36:37.153 --> 00:36:39.364
[Aldo] Yes, yes, Gucci is doing fine
under my watch.

517
00:36:39.447 --> 00:36:41.449
-[Paolo] No.
-[Aldo] No, don't worry about it.

518
00:36:41.532 --> 00:36:43.659
No. No.

519
00:36:43.743 --> 00:36:45.578
It needs new ideas.

520
00:36:45.661 --> 00:36:47.038
-New energy.
-[Aldo] Of course.

521
00:36:47.121 --> 00:36:50.166
And I happen to be bursting
with creativity.

522
00:36:50.249 --> 00:36:53.503
Yes, my bladder may be full,

523
00:36:53.586 --> 00:36:57.173
but my dreams are even fuller.

524
00:36:57.256 --> 00:37:00.468
I'm like a rush of water.

525
00:37:00.551 --> 00:37:02.845
Somebody build a dam.

526
00:37:03.638 --> 00:37:04.764
Please.

527
00:37:04.847 --> 00:37:07.600
[Paolo] You're always brushing me off.

528
00:37:07.683 --> 00:37:09.102
I'm a designer.

529
00:37:09.185 --> 00:37:11.813
| need to express myself.

530
00:37:11.896 --> 00:37:16.818
But, why-- why all this sudden moaning?
What do you want?

531
00:37:16.901 --> 00:37:20.279
[Paolo]
Because I'm so sick of you ignoring me.

532
00:37:20.363 --> 00:37:22.156
| am sick of your talking.

533
00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:24.242
Sick of it.

534
00:37:24.325 --> 00:37:27.286
You deliberately hurt my feelings.

535
00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:29.038
No, no, no. Jenny.

536
00:37:29.122 --> 00:37:30.915
-[Aldo] No. That's what he wants.
-Jenny, honey.

537
00:37:30.998 --> 00:37:33.584
-Sit down, sit down.
-[Aldo] You have succeeded.

538

539
00:37:34.794 --> 00:37:37.463
-What?
-Thanks for having us, Uncle.

540
00:37:37.547 --> 00:37:41.968
Ah. My nephew, he has such great taste.

541
00:37:42.844 --> 00:37:46.180
Oh. A small wedding gift.

542
00:37:47.974 --> 00:37:50.977
-Thank you. Grazie.
-Come to New York.

543

Maurizio and my father
have been spending a lot of time

813
00:53:15.984 --> 00:53:18.820
together in New York and I thought...

814
00:53:20.614 --> 00:53:22.699
maybe you and I could do the same.

815
00:53:23.575 --> 00:53:28.163
-Why would I...
-[Paolo] Well, to discuss.

816

My father, he just won't see it.

823
00:53:48.558 --> 00:53:49.726
But...

824
00:53:50.727 --> 00:53:52.020
These are yours?

825
00:53:52.104 --> 00:53:54.773
How can the family doesn't know
you have a gift?

826
00:53:55.607 --> 00:53:57.526
Domenico, did you know Paolo had a gift?

827
00:53:57.609 --> 00:53:59.444
I'm afraid I did not, sir.

-Yes?

You think they might steal
my ideas, right?

845

Oh, call me a lawyer. Not you.

846
00:55:07.804 --> 00:55:10.640
Over the years, I have found that...

847
00:55:11.975 --> 00:55:14.728
true talent is often

848
00:55:14.811 --> 00:55:18.356
unaware of its own brilliance.

849
00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:22.152

850
00:55:22.235 --> 00:55:24.404
and protected whereas hacks,

858
00:55:45.967 --> 00:55:48.261
My dear nephew, you have achieved...

859
00:55:49.804 --> 00:55:53.391
a triumph of mediocrity.

860
00:55:55.310 --> 00:55:58.980
And you have also achieved
the unimaginable.

861
00:56:00.315 --> 00:56:02.692
You have found one thing

862
00:56:03.777 --> 00:56:08.114

863
00:56:09.699 --> 00:56:14.329

But I...

868
00:56:35.308 --> 00:56:37.894
You designed this scarf, correct?

869
00:56:37.978 --> 00:56:39.104
[Rodolfo] Oh, yes.

870
00:56:39.854 --> 00:56:42.440
That scarf is my signature.

871
00:56:42.524 --> 00:56:45.443

of all the world's beauties.

873
00:56:50.448 --> 00:56:52.325
Study it closely.

874
00:56:53.493 --> 00:56:56.538
No browns, no pastels.

875
00:56:58.081 --> 00:56:59.457
-Come.
-Yeah.

876
00:57:19.227 --> 00:57:21.646

877
00:57:23.106 --> 00:57:24.899
I'm Paolo.

878
00:57:25.692 --> 00:57:27.235

879
00:57:29.362 --> 00:57:31.448

883
00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:56.598
Mr. Gucci.

884
00:57:58.892 --> 00:57:59.934
Are you okay?

885
00:58:00.018 --> 00:58:01.019
Si sl.

886
00:58:05.982 --> 00:58:07.067
Grazie.

Shh.

-Franco.
-Ciao, Franco.

892
00:58:39.641 --> 00:58:42.394
Maurizio. [speaking Italian]

00:58:42.477 --> 00:58:45.980
[coughing]

894
00:58:52.445 --> 00:58:54.322
Excuse me. Excuse me.

895
00:58:59.953 --> 00:59:01.454
What is this?

896
00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:04.541
Ah.

897
00:59:07.419 --> 00:59:08.628
I'm a grandfather?

898
00:59:13.133 --> 00:59:15.301
[Patrizia] Her name is Alessandra.

899
00:59:16.594 --> 00:59:18.471
Like Maurizio's mother.

900
00:59:21.015 --> 00:59:24.310
Oh. Whose idea was that?

901
00:59:28.398 --> 00:59:30.525
-Mine.
-[Rodolfo] Well...

902

Here, come here. Come, come.

904
00:59:36.948 --> 00:59:38.491
Come, come, come, come, come, come.

905
00:59:42.746 --> 00:59:44.289
My boy.

906
01:00:01.306 --> 01:00:03.725
You take care of Gucci now, hmm?

907
01:00:06.728 --> 01:00:08.730
I'm glad it wasn't a boy.

908

Thank you for coming, Uncle.

-Yes.

[Domenico] The house in St. Moritz.

918

Two beach houses, one in Nassau,
the other in Taormina.

Twenty-three horses.

And, of course, 50% of Gucci SpA.

the share certificate.

[Maurizio] Okay, what does that mean?

You'll have to pay inheritance tax.

No, that's fine. How much are we talking?

929
01:02:09.809 --> 01:02:12.312
Could be as high as 14 billion lira.

-[Maurizio] 14 billion?
-[Domenico] Yeah.

932
01:02:17.483 --> 01:02:19.611
Well, you could sell your shares.

Of course.

[Patrizia] Who does he think he is
suggesting you sell your shares?

939
01:02:37.295 --> 01:02:38.963
Madness.

940
01:02:39.047 --> 01:02:40.882
Fourteen billion is totally unreasonable.

941
01:02:40.965 --> 01:02:43.927
And just because your father
forgot to sign it.

Don't let them take it.

And don't trust anybody

945
01:03:13.456 --> 01:03:17.877
because I see an abuse of trust.

946
01:03:17.961 --> 01:03:20.296
An attempt to deceive you

You understand?

948
01:03:22.674 --> 01:03:23.758
Yes, Pina.

949
01:03:24.926 --> 01:03:27.887
Always have something red on you
for protection.

950
01:03:27.971 --> 01:03:31.265
And wear more green.
Green is for cleansing.

951

Green doesn't go with my lipstick.

952
01:03:37.146 --> 01:03:39.148
Change your lipstick.

You're already so beautiful.

Or wear green underwear.

955

Maybe it's time for you to take back.

956
01:03:47.782 --> 01:03:51.577
Don't let these forces around you
dictate who you are.

957
01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:55.915
You are strong. You are magnificent. And...

Hmm. Look at this.

There's a great love in your life.

You just asked me a question.

1086
01:12:28.886 --> 01:12:31.722
And what you really want to know
is whether you can ask me two questions,

1087

-one of which you've already asked.

Okay, here's my second question.

1091
01:12:43.317 --> 01:12:48.447
What do you see as being
your purpose at Gucci?

1092
01:12:50.491 --> 01:12:53.077
-Is this a job interview?
-Maybe.

1095
01:13:00.292 --> 01:13:01.835

1096
01:13:03.629 --> 01:13:05.256

1097
01:13:06.048 --> 01:13:07.758

such a strong connection

01:13:18.143 --> 01:13:19.186

1104
01:13:25.734 --> 01:13:29.822

1105
01:13:29.905 --> 01:13:34.285

1113

1126

Well, I like my cousin too.

1131
01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:12.841
He's quiet like a... like a little mouse.

1132
01:15:12.925 --> 01:15:17.179
A tiny little mouse,
he doesn't scream like the others.

1133
01:15:17.262 --> 01:15:20.891
No, he doesn't.
And you and Maurizio together,

1134
01:15:20.974 --> 01:15:23.686
that would be amazing.
That's a new chapter for Gucci.

1135
01:15:23.769 --> 01:15:27.606
No, no, no. My father,
he would never allow it.

1136
01:15:27.690 --> 01:15:31.652
He's got my little peaches
in a very tight grip.

1137
01:15:31.735 --> 01:15:33.153
Paolo...

1138
01:15:35.447 --> 01:15:36.865

Well, what would I get out of this?

01:16:41.847 --> 01:16:44.183
We could offer you an exclusive deal

1154

1155
01:16:47.853 --> 01:16:49.855

1160
01:17:05.871 --> 01:17:07.456

But Patrizia, that's not the point.

1162
01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:12.961
Don't focus on the process.
Focus on the result.

1163

his clothing line under Gucci

1164
01:17:19.384 --> 01:17:21.094

1165
01:17:26.266 --> 01:17:28.852
Maurizio, those designs
won't see the light of day.

1166

[Maurizio]
Ciao, Paolo. You sounded urgent.

1172
01:18:14.022 --> 01:18:15.941
| came right away. Hello.

of his ex-secretaries.

1174
01:18:33.375 --> 01:18:36.086
He's not exactly a favorite
among the exes.

1175
01:18:36.169 --> 01:18:39.423
In fact, they all hate his guts.

1176

1177
01:18:45.012 --> 01:18:49.808
with a very black hole
of undeclared income.

1178
01:18:49.892 --> 01:18:54.062
Paolo, this is fraud on a global scale.

1179
01:18:54.146 --> 01:18:56.106
In Italy, taxes are okay.

1180
01:18:56.189 --> 01:19:00.277
But in America, it is very different.

1181
01:19:01.028 --> 01:19:03.196
We should keep this to ourselves.

1182
01:19:04.615 --> 01:19:08.452
But we can use it as-- as leverage

1183
01:19:08.535 --> 01:19:10.454
to persuade him a bit.

1184
01:19:10.537 --> 01:19:14.541

And he won't get into
any real trouble, right?

1188
01:19:23.175 --> 01:19:25.928
No, at this point,

And she has bigger mangoes than you.

1326
01:28:21.421 --> 01:28:25.049

-Hey, watch out.
-Who knew?

1330
01:28:35.685 --> 01:28:37.103
Paolo, we both know it's for the best.

1331
01:28:37.187 --> 01:28:38.563
"Both."

1332
01:28:41.733 --> 01:28:47.530
Never confuse shit for cioccolato.

1333
01:28:47.614 --> 01:28:50.492
They may look the same,

1334
01:28:50.575 --> 01:28:52.327
but the taste?

1335
01:28:52.410 --> 01:28:53.953
Very different.

1336
01:28:54.037 --> 01:28:55.872

01:36:21.025 --> 01:36:23.569
-[friends chuckle]
-As soon as we landed,

1435
01:36:23.653 --> 01:36:26.906
we went to the Jules Verne restaurant
in the Eiffel Tower.

1436
01:36:26.989 --> 01:36:28.407
It's at the top.

1437
01:36:28.491 --> 01:36:30.534
No, no, no. It's on the second floor.

1438
01:36:32.828 --> 01:36:34.747
It was magnificent.

1439
01:36:35.790 --> 01:36:37.583
Later, we went to the Louvre.

1440
01:36:37.667 --> 01:36:39.752
I'd always dreamt of seeing the Louvre.

1441
01:36:39.835 --> 01:36:42.755
We arranged for a private tour. Thank God.

1442
01:36:42.838 --> 01:36:45.341
Imagine all those crowds.
| couldn't do it.

1443
01:36:45.424 --> 01:36:48.010
They just want to know where
you got the macaroons, sweetie.

1444
01:36:48.094 --> 01:36:49.136
I'm telling them.

1445
01:36:49.220 --> 01:36:52.014
You're filling the story
full of unnecessary details.

1446
01:36:53.891 --> 01:36:55.351
| don't think our guests mind.

1447
01:36:55.434 --> 01:36:57.728
They wouldn't say if they did.

1448
01:36:59.689 --> 01:37:01.565
You're an unnecessary detail.

1449
01:37:03.234 --> 01:37:04.819
[laughs]

1450
01:37:09.865 --> 01:37:12.785
What I'm trying to tell you is,
De Sole is the only person

1451
01:37:12.868 --> 01:37:15.663
who saw the unsigned certificates.

1452
01:37:15.746 --> 01:37:17.999
He worked for my father for ten years

1453
01:37:18.082 --> 01:37:19.750
and he never questioned him.

1454
01:37:20.501 --> 01:37:21.877
| trust him.

1455
01:37:22.878 --> 01:37:24.630
He's not the problem.

1456
01:37:26.257 --> 01:37:29.552
| heard the way you spoke to me at lunch.
He's not the problem?

1457
01:37:29.635 --> 01:37:31.220
| was tired.

1458
01:37:33.431 --> 01:37:37.226
Next time, don't embarrass me
in front of those people.

1459
01:37:37.309 --> 01:37:39.020
Those people are friends of mine.

1460
01:37:39.770 --> 01:37:42.231
I've known most of them longer than you.

1461
01:37:43.232 --> 01:37:45.526
He is the problem.

1462
01:37:45.609 --> 01:37:47.945
-Say it.
-Patrizia, I was tired.

1463
01:37:48.029 --> 01:37:49.030
I'm tired.

1464
01:37:49.739 --> 01:37:52.158
Then wake yourself up and say it.

1465
01:37:52.241 --> 01:37:53.242
Okay.

1466
01:37:53.325 --> 01:37:56.829
When you make me sneak around
my own family,

1467
01:37:56.912 --> 01:37:59.165
when you set father and son
against each other

1468
01:37:59.248 --> 01:38:01.042
and me against Paolo.

1469
01:38:01.125 --> 01:38:04.670
When you second guess a person
like Domenico De Sole,

1470
01:38:04.754 --> 01:38:07.465
the only person my father trusted.

1471
01:38:07.548 --> 01:38:10.176
These things have an effect on
the environment I operate in.

1472
01:38:10.259 --> 01:38:11.260
On me.

1473
01:38:12.553 --> 01:38:14.055
Actions have consequences.

1474
01:38:14.138 --> 01:38:16.974
| did that for you.
| was being constructive.

1475
01:38:17.058 --> 01:38:18.851
I'm not gonna apologize for that.

1476
01:38:18.934 --> 01:38:20.144
No thanks.

1477
01:38:21.896 --> 01:38:25.649
My uncle is in prison
and my cousin thinks I'm scum.

1478
01:38:25.733 --> 01:38:27.610
And you think that's constructive?

1479
01:38:27.693 --> 01:38:29.987
Don't pin Gucci's problems on me. Okay?

1480
01:38:30.071 --> 01:38:31.864
I'm just here mopping up
your fucking mess.

1481
01:38:31.947 --> 01:38:33.949
| never asked for your help.

1482
01:38:45.753 --> 01:38:49.381
Maurizio, we're only stronger together.

1483
01:38:54.095 --> 01:38:56.514
The only thing I need from you

1484
01:38:56.597 --> 01:39:00.059
is to stay away from Gucci
before you cause any more damage.

1485
01:39:01.769 --> 01:39:03.813
| can handle it by myself.

1486
01:39:04.522 --> 01:39:05.898
Is that clear?

1487
01:39:09.902 --> 01:39:12.530
Truthfully, I'm only getting involved

1488
01:39:12.613 --> 01:39:16.784
because you are
an incompetent, little baby idiot.

1489
01:39:16.867 --> 01:39:19.495
You're a fucking weak little brat.

1490
01:39:19.578 --> 01:39:22.498
You really are only one half of Gucci.

1491
01:39:22.581 --> 01:39:23.874
The shit half.

1492
01:39:28.462 --> 01:39:30.131
And you want a real man?

1493
01:39:30.214 --> 01:39:31.340
Here.

1494
01:39:31.423 --> 01:39:32.716
Maybe you'll grow a little.

1495
01:39:48.649 --> 01:39:50.651
-[toy beeping]
-[Maurizio] Red, green, red, green.

1496
01:39:50.734 --> 01:39:53.696
-Red. Red.
-Red. Red.

1497
01:39:53.779 --> 01:39:55.197
Very good, Alessandra.

1498
01:39:55.281 --> 01:39:58.450
-Green, red. Green, red.
-Green, red. Green, red.

1499
01:39:58.534 --> 01:40:01.871
[Maurizio] I think that's it.
Red, green, red, green, red, blue.

Red, green, red, green,

01:40:10.671 --> 01:40:12.047
-Red, green.
-Red, green.

1505
01:40:12.131 --> 01:40:14.091
-Red, green.
-Red, green.

1506
01:40:14.175 --> 01:40:16.677
Red, blue, yellow.

1507
01:40:18.137 --> 01:40:20.890
-You're very...
-The winner! [laughs]

1508
01:40:20.973 --> 01:40:22.892
-[toy buzzes]
-The winner gets a present.

1509
01:40:22.975 --> 01:40:23.893
[Alessandra chuckles]

1510
01:40:24.852 --> 01:40:26.353
For Alessandra.

1511
01:40:27.146 --> 01:40:29.148
Thank you, Mommy.

1512
01:40:29.231 --> 01:40:31.108
All right, we'll play later.

1513
01:40:37.531 --> 01:40:38.949
Who is that?

1514
01:40:39.992 --> 01:40:41.285
Turn it around.

1515
01:40:42.036 --> 01:40:43.954
Who is that?

1516
01:40:44.038 --> 01:40:45.456
Who is hiding in there?

1517
01:40:48.209 --> 01:40:49.793
-I love you.
-Aw.

1518
01:40:49.877 --> 01:40:52.963
| love you. 7/ amo. Amore mio.

1519
01:40:53.047 --> 01:40:54.882
Merry Christmas.

1520
01:40:56.008 --> 01:40:57.343
Do you like him?

1521
01:40:59.094 --> 01:41:01.555
For Daddy, from me.

1522
01:41:07.519 --> 01:41:10.439
You can change the strap
if you don't like that color.

1523
01:41:10.522 --> 01:41:11.774
No, no, it's fine.

1524
01:41:15.027 --> 01:41:16.153
Okay.

1525
01:41:17.529 --> 01:41:18.656
Thank you.

1526
01:41:23.827 --> 01:41:26.664
For Mommy, from Daddy.

1527
01:41:27.790 --> 01:41:30.459
-Oh.
-I never know what to get you.

1528
01:41:32.670 --> 01:41:34.338
I'm sure it's perfect.

1529
01:41:45.891 --> 01:41:47.643
A Bloomingdale's gift card.

1530
01:41:49.270 --> 01:41:51.272
Now you can get what you want.

1531
01:41:53.524 --> 01:41:55.067
You know, I never shop there.

1532
01:41:56.986 --> 01:41:59.113
Well, there's a first time for everything.

1533
01:42:21.218 --> 01:42:23.345
-Paola, darling.
-Oh.

1534
01:42:23.429 --> 01:42:25.681
Love the all-white outfit.

1535
01:42:25.764 --> 01:42:26.974
So chic.

1536
01:42:27.057 --> 01:42:29.393
| made some strudel for you and M.

1537
01:42:29.476 --> 01:42:31.395
It's the only thing I know how to make.

1538
01:42:31.478 --> 01:42:35.065
I'm on a diet, but I'm sure
Maurizio will love your strudel.

1539
01:42:35.149 --> 01:42:36.400
[grunts]

1540
01:42:38.110 --> 01:42:39.611
Would you like a cigarette?

1541
01:42:39.695 --> 01:42:40.821
No.

1542
01:42:41.488 --> 01:42:43.407
-Grazie, signore.
-Prego.

1543
01:42:48.787 --> 01:42:51.415
You ever steal anything, Paola?

1544
01:42:51.498 --> 01:42:53.000
What?

1545
01:42:53.083 --> 01:42:56.503
Forgive me. I'm trying to teach Alessandra

1546
01:42:56.587 --> 01:42:59.256
the importance of not touching
other people's belongings.

1547
01:43:07.806 --> 01:43:09.641
| don't consider myself

1548
01:43:09.725 --> 01:43:12.686
a particularly ethical person
but I am fair.

1549
01:43:16.482 --> 01:43:18.650
What I cannot wrap my head around...

1550
01:43:20.402 --> 01:43:23.614
is people who steal just for ego.

1551
01:43:24.406 --> 01:43:26.200
Or the pleasure of it.

1552
01:43:27.618 --> 01:43:29.912
For personal satisfaction.

1553
01:43:44.885 --> 01:43:46.970
I'll have my maid drop off the strudel.

1554
01:43:51.100 --> 01:43:52.518
Good to see you.

1555
01:43:58.023 --> 01:43:59.233
[scoffs]

1556
01:44:02.986 --> 01:44:05.406
[church bell tolling]

1557
01:44:11.245 --> 01:44:12.454
[clears throat]

1558
01:44:15.207 --> 01:44:16.417
Do you like my hair?

[fire crackling]

1560
01:44:27.511 --> 01:44:29.721
Maurizio, you like my hair?

1561
01:44:32.099 --> 01:44:33.934
Oh, yes, very nice.

1562
01:44:34.017 --> 01:44:35.352
Very chic.

1563
01:44:36.687 --> 01:44:38.105
| was thinking tomorrow...

1564
01:45:04.423 --> 01:45:06.467
Franco's coming tomorrow at noon.

1565
01:45:08.886 --> 01:45:10.304
Why?

1566
01:45:12.973 --> 01:45:15.434
To take you both back to Milan.

1567
01:45:19.730 --> 01:45:21.565
Can we at least talk about it?

1568
01:45:28.030 --> 01:45:29.198
[gasps]

1569
01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:32.201
[sobbing]

1570
01:45:37.873 --> 01:45:41.460
| will find the right words to say
what I want to say when I'm ready.

1571
01:45:44.254 --> 01:45:46.965
You really, really hurt me.

1572
01:45:58.602 --> 01:45:59.436
[door slams]

1573
01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:03.315
Paolo won't do it.
He's too scared of his father.

1574
01:46:03.398 --> 01:46:04.983
[Domenico] He's drowning in debt.

1575
01:46:05.067 --> 01:46:06.944
But we can't buy him out.

1576
01:46:07.027 --> 01:46:08.946
We need a cash partner, Maurizio.

1577
01:46:09.780 --> 01:46:11.573
Who do you suggest?

1578
01:46:11.657 --> 01:46:13.450
Investcorp.

1579
01:46:13.534 --> 01:46:15.369
It's owned by Nemir Kirdar.

1580
01:46:15.452 --> 01:46:17.704
He's an Iraqi powerhouse.

1581
01:46:17.788 --> 01:46:20.290
They like high-end retail investments.

1582
01:46:20.374 --> 01:46:23.502
They bought Tiffany's in 84
and turned it around quick.

1583
01:46:33.262 --> 01:46:34.805
Maurizio?

1584
01:46:35.597 --> 01:46:37.057
[Maurizio] Plant the seed with him.

1585
01:46:37.140 --> 01:46:38.725
I'll be back soon.

1586
01:46:42.854 --> 01:46:44.481
[Patrizia] Something's different.

1587
01:46:45.190 --> 01:46:49.486
Maurizio's changed. He's excessive and...

1588
01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:51.488
crazy.

1589
01:46:52.948 --> 01:46:54.283
And that woman...

1590
01:46:56.159 --> 01:46:58.036
[Pina] Don't be scared.

1591
01:46:58.120 --> 01:46:59.997
He's nothing without you.

1592
01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:01.623
Hmm?

1593
01:47:01.707 --> 01:47:04.251
Men have an awful problem with thinking

1594
01:47:04.334 --> 01:47:06.712
they are smarter than they actually are.

1595
01:47:06.795 --> 01:47:12.217
You mustn't let
this negative energy eat you up, huh?

1596
01:47:12.301 --> 01:47:13.844
[crying]

1597
01:47:13.927 --> 01:47:18.265
Remember. You are unstoppable, Patrizia.

1598
01:47:19.016 --> 01:47:20.100
Say it.

1599
01:47:21.059 --> 01:47:22.644
I'm unstoppable.

1600
01:47:26.982 --> 01:47:28.400
I'm unstoppable.

1601
01:47:30.527 --> 01:47:32.446
I'm only 50% of Gucci.

1602
01:47:32.529 --> 01:47:36.033
I'm here representing my own interests.

1603

to the forefront of today's fashion.

1604

who can buy up the other half

1605
01:47:43.957 --> 01:47:46.126
of Gucci that's giving me a headache.

1606
01:47:47.252 --> 01:47:51.715
The half that's preventing Gucci
from being great.

1607
01:47:51.798 --> 01:47:55.135
The half that belongs
to your uncle and your cousin?

1608
01:47:55.218 --> 01:47:57.512

01:59:08.349 --> 01:59:11.102
To be able to finally sit down
with a member of the dynasty,

1784
01:59:11.185 --> 01:59:14.981
it's something we will cherish forever.

1785
01:59:15.064 --> 01:59:16.441
[Aldo] Yeah.

1786
01:59:16.524 --> 01:59:20.570
And truly, I understand
how difficult this is.

1787
01:59:20.653 --> 01:59:23.614
Please, don't patronize me. Please.

1788
01:59:24.282 --> 01:59:28.036
Those words are not comforting to me.

1789
01:59:28.119 --> 01:59:32.957
They make me feel offended,
you know, I must say.

1790
01:59:33.750 --> 01:59:37.712
Mr. Gucci, I have a plane
that leaves in one hour.

1791
01:59:37.795 --> 01:59:41.382
If there is a problem with the offer,
Said and Omar, they're at your disposal--

1792
01:59:41.466 --> 01:59:46.721
No, no, no, we are very grateful
for your offer,

Nemir, the shoe you showed me before,

1796
01:59:54.979 --> 01:59:58.274
take a look inside your shoe
and see, at the heel,

1797
01:59:58.358 --> 02:00:00.193
there's something you should see.

1798

This is the rarest of shoes.

You see that? You see that?

1804
02:00:21.130 --> 02:00:22.799
There's a gold leaf.

1805

You know...

1806
02:00:25.510 --> 02:00:27.595
| had to stop doing that.

1807
02:00:27.678 --> 02:00:29.597
It got too expensive.

1808
02:00:33.976 --> 02:00:34.977
So...

1809
02:00:37.105 --> 02:00:38.731
Where did you get that shoe?

1810
02:00:40.149 --> 02:00:41.442
Wait.

1811
02:00:41.526 --> 02:00:44.779
There's no way you bought
that shoe in London.

1812
02:00:45.655 --> 02:00:47.115
Who gave it to you?

1813
02:00:49.367 --> 02:00:50.368
Would you know?

1814
02:00:52.662 --> 02:00:54.414
My, he doesn't want to answer?

1815
02:00:54.497 --> 02:00:57.375
-[Paolo] Well, that's the least--
-[Aldo] This meeting is over.

Where is he going?

1818
02:01:03.589 --> 02:01:06.342
I'm very sorry. I had no choice.

No.

No.

Congratulations.

[Maurizio] Ms. Wintour, walk into any one
of Gucci's 144 international boutiques

1838
02:03:35.116 --> 02:03:39.245
and you will find you're walking
into a new world, a new vision.

1839
02:03:39.328 --> 02:03:42.540
But wasn't the lure of Gucci

1840
02:03:42.623 --> 02:03:45.376
precisely its historical appeal?

1841
02:03:45.459 --> 02:03:48.796
The legacy is remarkable.

1842
02:03:48.879 --> 02:03:50.214
[Maurizio] Well, this is true.

1843
02:03:50.298 --> 02:03:53.968
We are products of our past
but we don't have to be prisoners of it.

02:10:13.681 --> 02:10:17.101
Maybe you should wait
until we come back from the Caymans.

1958
02:10:17.726 --> 02:10:19.520
And then we can...

1959
02:10:19.603 --> 02:10:23.399
we can do a nice evil eye on him, hmm?

1960
02:10:25.401 --> 02:10:26.652
Another spell?

1961
02:10:31.240 --> 02:10:32.866
We've run out of spells.

1962
02:10:35.577 --> 02:10:37.413
We need something stronger.

1963
02:10:44.837 --> 02:10:48.590
Maybe I can still do something
that will work.

1964
02:10:48.674 --> 02:10:52.720
But for that, you have to be positive.

1965
02:11:03.230 --> 02:11:06.066
I'm being very fucking positive.

1966
02:11:07.026 --> 02:11:08.027

02:11:15.826 --> 02:11:18.495
I want the world to know
what you're really like.

1971
02:11:19.163 --> 02:11:23.125
I will not give you a minute of peace.

[beeps]

1975
02:11:30.758 --> 02:11:35.262
You are a painful appendage
that needs to be removed.

1976
02:11:36.013 --> 02:11:38.640
The inferno for you ls yet to come.

1977

[turns off]

1978
02:11:42.352 --> 02:11:43.437
Ciao, Pina.

1979
02:11:45.439 --> 02:11:47.691
-Two, Rita.
-[Patrizia] Where the fuck are they?

1980
02:11:48.901 --> 02:11:51.904
If I knew how to use a pistol,
I'd fucking do this shit myself.

1981
02:11:51.987 --> 02:11:53.238
Calm down, calm down.

1982
02:12:00.788 --> 02:12:03.248
They'll show up. Come sit.

1984
02:12:18.555 --> 02:12:20.099
-Thank you.
-[Rita] Enjoy.

1985

Pina.

1986
02:12:41.161 --> 02:12:44.998
Yeah, Ivano, I told Patrizia
that I know you

1987
02:12:45.082 --> 02:12:47.209
since you were a child, huh?

1988
02:12:48.085 --> 02:12:49.711
That we trust you.

1989
02:12:51.463 --> 02:12:52.798
I'm Ivano Savioni,

1990
02:12:52.881 --> 02:12:55.384
this is my associate, Benedetto Ceraulo.

1991
02:13:03.600 --> 02:13:05.060
Who does what?

1992
02:13:05.144 --> 02:13:07.896
Oh. Sicilian.

1993
02:13:09.731 --> 02:13:11.191
How soon can he do it?

1994
02:13:11.942 --> 02:13:16.738
As soon as we know his routine
and his security.

1995
02:13:16.822 --> 02:13:18.866
And we are set on a rate.

1996
02:13:21.118 --> 02:13:23.287
A rate? What rate?

1997
02:13:26.123 --> 02:13:28.125
-What is that?
-You told me six.

1998
02:13:28.917 --> 02:13:32.421
-Yeah, yeah. Are you crazy?
-Why's he saying eight?

1999
02:13:33.172 --> 02:13:34.882
-I don't know.
-Why the fuck is he saying eight?

2000
02:13:34.965 --> 02:13:36.300
-We said eight.
-No, it's six.

2001
02:13:36.383 --> 02:13:38.302
-We said eight.
-600 million lira.

2002
02:13:38.385 --> 02:13:39.928
That's it. What are you doing?

2003
02:13:40.012 --> 02:13:41.763
Keep your fucking voice down.

2004
02:13:41.847 --> 02:13:44.349
-We said eight. Yeah.
-I'd consider it only if it was eight.

2005
02:13:45.851 --> 02:13:48.270
Somebody else quoted me for far less.

2006
02:13:49.605 --> 02:13:51.106
Six is all I'm willing to do.

2007
02:13:51.190 --> 02:13:54.568
-It will have to be a rush job then.
-Yeah.

2008
02:13:55.694 --> 02:13:58.155
And you have to provide us
now with photographs.

2009
02:13:58.238 --> 02:14:02.117
Ah-ah-ah! Six is all I would pay.

2010
02:14:02.201 --> 02:14:03.785
We'll give you half now.

2011
02:14:05.245 --> 02:14:07.206
Half later, when it's done.

2012
02:14:08.707 --> 02:14:11.877
-Okay.
-Okay.

Don't miss.

Deal with her.

02:14:26.141 --> 02:14:30.103
Really. You don't want
to make any mistakes.

2016

Catch.

2017
02:14:34.358 --> 02:14:37.236

What concerns you?

2071
02:18:33.096 --> 02:18:34.306
Numbers.

2072
02:18:35.056 --> 02:18:36.683
Specifically Gucci's.

2073
02:18:38.810 --> 02:18:40.979
Well, you said you didn't
care about numbers,

2074
02:18:41.062 --> 02:18:43.440
that you trusted your instinct.

2075
02:18:43.523 --> 02:18:46.526
Yeah, I care about numbers
when they're terrible numbers.

2076
02:18:49.112 --> 02:18:52.657
Our projections for 1996 are abysmal.

By slashing hundreds of profitable items--

2078

You mean my uncle's knickknacks?

2079
02:19:01.249 --> 02:19:07.422
Losses are likely to total 30 million
this year on sales of 180 million,

2080
02:19:07.506 --> 02:19:11.009
down from 210 million in 1991.

2081
02:19:12.052 --> 02:19:14.137
And 270 million.

There is 85 million in bank debts.

We may even have trouble paying salaries
for the next couple of months.

Profits remain elusive.

2085
02:19:27.025 --> 02:19:30.487
I've always said that our strategic plan
would take five years.

2086
02:19:30.570 --> 02:19:34.241
It's not about immediate profit,
you go down to come back up again.

2087
02:19:34.324 --> 02:19:36.159
That is how you get out of a stall.

2088
02:19:36.243 --> 02:19:39.120
But the personal items
are a concern as well.

2089
02:19:40.080 --> 02:19:42.374
All paid for through Gucci's accounts

2090
02:19:42.457 --> 02:19:44.084

2091

The multimillion-dollar antiques
in the stores.

2092
02:19:46.795 --> 02:19:48.296

and a Lamborghini Countach,</i>

2094
02:19:51.424 --> 02:19:54.803

| have justifications
for all of these things,

2099
02:20:05.522 --> 02:20:08.149

in the spirit of our friendship.

2101

2102

You have many qualities.

2103
02:20:19.077 --> 02:20:20.579
But we must be realistic.

2104
02:20:20.662 --> 02:20:22.664
You're not a natural manager.

2105
02:20:22.747 --> 02:20:27.377
You can't run a business
purely on charm and eccentricities.

2106
02:20:27.460 --> 02:20:29.796
No, but you need time as well.

you or your vision.

2111

But I have vision for my people too.

2112
02:20:52.193 --> 02:20:53.987
And I have a business to run.

2113
02:21:00.910 --> 02:21:03.747
We want to offer you $150 million

2114
02:21:03.830 --> 02:21:05.915
for your 50% stake in Gucci.

2115
02:21:06.583 --> 02:21:08.209
You want to buy me out.

2116
02:21:08.293 --> 02:21:10.337
[Domenico] We want to save the business.

2117
02:21:10.420 --> 02:21:13.256
And who would be appointed CEO?

2118
02:21:24.768 --> 02:21:26.519
She was right about you.

2119
02:21:30.899 --> 02:21:33.401
$150 million.

2120
02:21:33.485 --> 02:21:34.611
You'll be a rich man.

2121
02:21:34.694 --> 02:21:36.237
If you really think it's about money

2122
02:21:36.321 --> 02:21:38.990
then you know less
about Gucci than I thought.

2123
