1
00:02:23.288 --> 00:02:24.624
Watch out!

2
00:02:24.812 --> 00:02:26.343
Oh!

3
00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.650
<i>Congratulations!</i>

4
00:03:02.697 --> 00:03:05.955
<i>Hudson High class of 2004.</i>

5
00:03:23.708 --> 00:03:25.544
There she is. Fiona!

6
00:03:26.974 --> 00:03:28.435
All right. Bye.

7
00:03:28.544 --> 00:03:30.343
- Hey.
- Hey.

8
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.117
Mm.

9
00:03:35.226 --> 00:03:38.327
- Congratulations, graduate.
- Thanks, baby.

10
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.366
And congratulations to you, Cooper.

11
00:03:40.406 --> 00:03:42.640
Aw! Thanks, baby.

12
00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:44.341
- Nice try.
- All right.

13
00:03:44.366 --> 00:03:46.109
I'll see you at Wade's party tonight?

14
00:03:46.164 --> 00:03:47.937
- See you then.
- All right.

15
00:03:49.042 --> 00:03:50.256
So...

16
00:03:50.326 --> 00:03:52.334
it's just you and me
for the entire summer.

17
00:03:52.365 --> 00:03:54.521
Next year you graduate,
join me at college.

18
00:03:54.576 --> 00:03:56.131
See? Just like we planned.

19
00:03:56.237 --> 00:03:57.709
Scott, we need to talk.

20
00:03:57.795 --> 00:03:59.693
Yeah? About what?

21
00:03:59.987 --> 00:04:01.880
About me dumping you.

22
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.312
Huh?

23
00:04:03.344 --> 00:04:04.475
There he is.

24
00:04:04.516 --> 00:04:07.055
The graduate and his beautiful girlfriend.

25
00:04:07.101 --> 00:04:08.696
Huh? Okay?

26
00:04:08.726 --> 00:04:11.000
Smile, you two.

27
00:04:11.062 --> 00:04:14.508
- Action.
- Dad, Mom, Grandma...

28
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.273
Uncle Moke, uh...

29
00:04:16.306 --> 00:04:18.641
I'm gonna need a minute here, okay?

30
00:04:18.923 --> 00:04:20.555
What do you mean,
you're dumping me?

31
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.484
Scotty, I just can't take all the lying
and cheating on each other anymore.

32
00:04:24.594 --> 00:04:27.555
What are you talking about?
Sweetie, I never cheated on you.

33
00:04:27.609 --> 00:04:29.742
I know. That's what
makes this so hard.

34
00:04:29.812 --> 00:04:32.016
You're looking good, you guys.

35
00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.234
Scotty, it's not you.

36
00:04:34.329 --> 00:04:35.906
It's me.

37
00:04:37.163 --> 00:04:40.367
There I go, lying again.
No, it was you.

38
00:04:40.489 --> 00:04:42.680
You're just so...

39
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.156
predictable.

40
00:04:44.227 --> 00:04:45.813
Smile.

41
00:04:46.579 --> 00:04:47.844
So that's it.

42
00:04:47.911 --> 00:04:49.601
Here's your letter jacket back.

43
00:04:49.649 --> 00:04:51.281
Goodbye.

44
00:04:52.456 --> 00:04:54.482
This isn't mine.

45
00:04:57.587 --> 00:04:59.372
Now, she's a keeper, huh?

46
00:04:59.404 --> 00:05:01.435
Oh, wow.

47
00:05:01.518 --> 00:05:03.388
Oh, my God.

48
00:05:05.094 --> 00:05:06.968
Fiona!

49
00:05:13.668 --> 00:05:15.472
Let's see that again.

50
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.115
<i>Fiona!</i>

51
00:05:20.261 --> 00:05:22.871
This is just so brutal.

52
00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:24.816
And yet, I can't look away.

53
00:05:24.918 --> 00:05:26.941
Bert, play it again.
Come on.

54
00:05:27.753 --> 00:05:29.019
Fiona!

55
00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:30.746
Bert, get out of here.

56
00:05:31.152 --> 00:05:33.582
- Okay. See you, Coop.
- All right.

57
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.324
Stay black, Bert.

58
00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:38.480
Fiona!

59
00:05:38.988 --> 00:05:40.496
<i>Mail, motherfucker!</i>

60
00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:42.753
Hey, I got one from Mieke.

61
00:05:45.957 --> 00:05:47.793
Happy herzlichen.

62
00:05:47.863 --> 00:05:49.285
Are you still writing that guy?

63
00:05:49.324 --> 00:05:51.089
I thought that was just for German class.

64
00:05:51.121 --> 00:05:52.511
Uh, yeah, it was at first.

65
00:05:52.543 --> 00:05:54.722
But you know, we're actually
becoming good friends.

66
00:05:54.761 --> 00:05:56.339
He's a really cool guy.

67
00:05:56.394 --> 00:05:58.019
Dear Mieke,

68
00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:01.675
greetings from your American pen pal.

69
00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:04.316
Scotty, Girl Scouts have pen pals.

70
00:06:04.511 --> 00:06:06.003
Listen to yourself, all right?

71
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.091
Now, you met a "cool guy"
on the Internet.

72
00:06:10.152 --> 00:06:12.253
Okay, this is how
these sexual predators work.

73
00:06:12.278 --> 00:06:15.019
Next thing you know, he's gonna
want to "arrange a meeting"...

74
00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:16.761
uh, where he will gas you,

75
00:06:16.786 --> 00:06:18.285
and stuff you in the back of his van,

76
00:06:18.316 --> 00:06:20.308
and make a wind chime
out of your genitals.

77
00:06:21.378 --> 00:06:22.707
Come on, let's go to Wade's.

78
00:06:22.761 --> 00:06:24.714
All right. Screw it.

79
00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:28.011
Let's go. I'm not gonna let Fiona
ruin my graduation night.

80
00:06:28.078 --> 00:06:31.128
Auf wiedersehen, Mieke.
(Goodbye, Mieke.)

81
00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:45.854
What's up, losers?

82
00:06:45.886 --> 00:06:47.901
- Nothing. What's up, Jenny?
- What's up, dude?

83
00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:50.073
Sorry to hear about Fiona.
She's a whore.

84
00:06:50.105 --> 00:06:51.971
Well, that's very sweet of you.
Thanks.

85
00:06:52.011 --> 00:06:53.386
All right. Enough Fiona talk.

86
00:06:53.411 --> 00:06:55.417
Look around. There's gotta be
100 drunk girls here.

87
00:06:55.456 --> 00:06:57.581
We should try to have sex
with every one of them.

88
00:06:57.659 --> 00:06:59.792
Hello?
Mixed company?

89
00:06:59.959 --> 00:07:01.245
What?

90
00:07:01.386 --> 00:07:03.393
- I'm a girl.
- No, you're not.

91
00:07:03.425 --> 00:07:05.221
Yeah, you're just a cool guy
with long hair.

92
00:07:05.261 --> 00:07:07.393
So, where's your evil twin brother at?

93
00:07:07.432 --> 00:07:08.612
Jenny!

94
00:07:08.651 --> 00:07:10.503
Oh. There he is.

95
00:07:11.327 --> 00:07:12.636
Hey, Jamie.

96
00:07:12.722 --> 00:07:14.292
In fine form, I see.

97
00:07:14.378 --> 00:07:15.745
Mm.

98
00:07:15.854 --> 00:07:17.448
Why'd you get me gin and tonic?

99
00:07:17.477 --> 00:07:18.893
I hate gin.

100
00:07:19.136 --> 00:07:20.151
You do?

101
00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.807
You guys are the worst twins ever.

102
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.627
So, when are you guys taking off?

103
00:07:31.744 --> 00:07:32.853
Tomorrow morning.

104
00:07:32.901 --> 00:07:34.291
Hey, Wade.

105
00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:36.246
Great party, buddy.

106
00:07:37.433 --> 00:07:39.301
And I am so excited.

107
00:07:39.347 --> 00:07:41.910
A whole summer,
backpacking around Europe.

108
00:07:42.046 --> 00:07:45.816
You should have come with us
instead of working for Dr. Dad, Scotty!

109
00:07:45.863 --> 00:07:48.379
Oh, it's gonna be so awesome!

110
00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:49.715
- Yeah.
- Oh, thanks.

111
00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:52.012
I planned every detail of the trip...

112
00:07:52.067 --> 00:07:53.614
to maximize the fun.

113
00:07:53.691 --> 00:07:55.535
You brought a guidebook to a party?

114
00:07:55.574 --> 00:07:57.254
You guys wanna see my itinerary?

115
00:07:57.301 --> 00:07:59.488
You wanna see my balls?

116
00:08:00.283 --> 00:08:02.471
So, you guys decide where
you're gonna go first?

117
00:08:02.549 --> 00:08:04.321
Paris. I can't wait.

118
00:08:04.377 --> 00:08:06.196
I heard two years ago,
Nicky Jager's sister,

119
00:08:06.221 --> 00:08:08.063
Debbie, met this very
wealthy French guy...

120
00:08:08.088 --> 00:08:10.955
and spent a month sailing
the Mediterranean on his yacht.

121
00:08:11.026 --> 00:08:14.166
Isn't that the most romantic thing
you've ever heard?

122
00:08:14.208 --> 00:08:17.625
You stuck on a boat
with a weird French guy?

123
00:08:17.912 --> 00:08:19.945
That sounds a little gay.

124
00:08:20.063 --> 00:08:21.586
It, it's not gay.

125
00:08:21.649 --> 00:08:23.040
I'm a girl.

126
00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:25.289
- Kind of gay.
- A little gay.

127
00:08:25.977 --> 00:08:26.984
All right.

128
00:08:27.024 --> 00:08:29.234
I gotta piss like a pregnant woman.

129
00:08:31.048 --> 00:08:33.338
Hey, listen up, everybody.

130
00:08:33.783 --> 00:08:36.377
Got a little special thing
I'd like to do tonight.

131
00:08:36.447 --> 00:08:38.768
Gonna play a little song for you...

132
00:08:38.846 --> 00:08:40.831
about the nastiest,

133
00:08:40.893 --> 00:08:43.236
freakiest little sex puppet I know...

134
00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:44.543
- Whoa!
- Yeah.

135
00:08:44.673 --> 00:08:45.924
Fiona.

136
00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:53.886
This one's for you, baby.

137
00:08:53.957 --> 00:08:55.316

184
00:11:02.577 --> 00:11:03.975
Mm-hm.

185
00:11:04.428 --> 00:11:06.701
No, it's just not coming off.

186
00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:09.045
What is it?

187
00:11:09.108 --> 00:11:10.560
Fine, I'll do it.

188
00:11:10.623 --> 00:11:12.061
Come here.

189
00:11:12.388 --> 00:11:14.826
Oh, my God! Candy!

190
00:11:15.396 --> 00:11:17.365
Cooper!

191
00:11:18.035 --> 00:11:19.411
Hey.

192
00:11:19.984 --> 00:11:22.885
Well, this isn't where I parked my car.

193
00:11:25.385 --> 00:11:26.830

Scotty doesn't know.

200
00:11:41.962 --> 00:11:43.665
This band rocks.

201
00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.212
- Scotty doesn't know.
- Yeah.

202
00:11:45.244 --> 00:11:47.064
Scotty doesn't know.

203
00:12:10.082 --> 00:12:11.787
<i>Mail, motherfucker!</i>

204
00:12:19.069 --> 00:12:20.320
Hey, Mieke.

205
00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.896
Dear Scott,

206
00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:24.865
I was very sad to hear
about your lady woman,

207
00:12:24.897 --> 00:12:26.444
Fiona, dumping you.

208
00:12:26.552 --> 00:12:28.724
Since you no longer have a girlfriend,

209
00:12:28.763 --> 00:12:32.075
maybe I could come to America and
we could get to know each other better.

210
00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:34.092
Perhaps, we could...

211
00:12:35.441 --> 00:12:36.769
<i>"zussamen."</i>

212
00:12:37.317 --> 00:12:39.982
What the fuck is "zussamen"?

213
00:12:46.892 --> 00:12:48.296
"Arrange a meeting."

214
00:12:48.839 --> 00:12:51.644
No, no, no. Come on.
Cooper was right.

215
00:12:51.683 --> 00:12:53.519
This guy wants to have sex with me.

216
00:12:53.605 --> 00:12:54.847
Um,

217
00:12:54.957 --> 00:12:56.480
listen, Mieke.

218
00:12:57.319 --> 00:13:00.417
I don't want to arrange
any meetings with you.

219
00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:02.769
You sick, German freak.

220
00:13:02.863 --> 00:13:06.167
So, so, please,
keep your hands off my genitals...

221
00:13:06.222 --> 00:13:10.683
and never write to me again,
and don't come to America.

222
00:13:10.814 --> 00:13:12.113
Good bye.

223
00:13:18.308 --> 00:13:19.616
Ow.

224
00:13:31.896 --> 00:13:34.231
I'm never drinking again.

225
00:13:34.872 --> 00:13:36.300
Oh, that's nice.

226
00:13:40.367 --> 00:13:41.622
Bert, what are you doing?

227
00:13:41.716 --> 00:13:43.465
Reading your e-mail.

228
00:13:43.518 --> 00:13:44.950
Don't do that.

229
00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:49.450
Why are you wearing my bathrobe?

230
00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:51.262
Oh, I'm sorry.

231
00:13:51.302 --> 00:13:54.497
But, somebody pissed
all over mine last night.

232
00:13:56.333 --> 00:14:00.716
Wow. I can't believe this German chick
wants to come here and hook up with you.

233
00:14:00.786 --> 00:14:02.848
No, I don't think so, buddy.
Mieke's a guy.

234
00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.044
Um, no.

235
00:14:04.091 --> 00:14:06.434
It says right here,
"trauriges madchen".

236
00:14:06.473 --> 00:14:09.208
"I was a sad girl to hear about Fiona."

237
00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:13.083
I'm taking Intro to German,
and even I know that.

238
00:14:13.149 --> 00:14:14.419
Come here.

239
00:14:14.622 --> 00:14:16.497
He sent me a picture, retardo.

240
00:14:16.559 --> 00:14:17.614
See?

241
00:14:17.654 --> 00:14:20.435
That's a picture of Mieke
and that's his cute cousin, Jan.

242
00:14:20.473 --> 00:14:22.372
No, retardo.

243
00:14:22.427 --> 00:14:24.927
That's Jan, a man's name.

244
00:14:24.973 --> 00:14:27.317
And that's not "Mike".
It's "Mieke".

245
00:14:27.379 --> 00:14:29.255
A common German girl's name...

246
00:14:29.299 --> 00:14:31.223
similar to our Michelle.

247
00:14:31.411 --> 00:14:34.598
I hope you wrote her back
and told her to come and visit.

248
00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.512
You didn't?

249
00:14:38.669 --> 00:14:40.848
You thought she was a guy.

250
00:14:40.951 --> 00:14:43.403
I'm getting the video camera.

251
00:14:44.992 --> 00:14:46.885
- What an asshole!
- No.

252
00:14:47.081 --> 00:14:48.182
No.

253
00:14:48.541 --> 00:14:49.627
No.

254
00:14:50.207 --> 00:14:57.113
No!

255
00:15:23.465 --> 00:15:24.615
Address blocked?

256
00:15:24.678 --> 00:15:26.709
E-mail not delivered. No.

257
00:15:26.748 --> 00:15:28.568
No, come on.

258
00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:31.560
Hey, your mom made waffles.

259
00:15:31.654 --> 00:15:34.771
- What's going on?
- I'm in love with my pen pal.

260
00:15:35.232 --> 00:15:37.154
I'm in love with Mieke.

261
00:15:39.648 --> 00:15:40.959
Okay.

262
00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:42.866
Okay.

263
00:15:43.616 --> 00:15:44.623
You know what?

264
00:15:44.648 --> 00:15:46.366
I was actually expecting this.

265
00:15:46.428 --> 00:15:47.795
And frankly, no, listen,

266
00:15:47.843 --> 00:15:50.444
I'm flattered you picked me
to come out to first.

267
00:15:50.529 --> 00:15:53.428
And don't worry about
telling your folks because uh,

268
00:15:53.514 --> 00:15:54.733
I think they already know.

269
00:15:54.764 --> 00:15:56.623
No, you idiot.
Mieke is a girl.

270
00:15:56.678 --> 00:15:58.233
No, no, I get it. Yeah.

271
00:15:58.272 --> 00:16:00.249
He's the girl, and you're the girl...

272
00:16:00.295 --> 00:16:03.077
and sometimes, uh,
you're both the girl.

273
00:16:03.589 --> 00:16:04.780
Right?

274
00:16:05.116 --> 00:16:06.140
Right?

275
00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:07.350
That's hot.

276
00:16:07.388 --> 00:16:10.334
But you know, whatever works for you.
I'm, I'm not gonna judge it.

277
00:16:10.372 --> 00:16:11.991
Will you stop?
Look, come here.

278
00:16:12.046 --> 00:16:13.803
Look at this picture.

279
00:16:15.202 --> 00:16:16.787
Wow. Who's the hot chick?

280
00:16:16.834 --> 00:16:18.397
That's Mieke.

281
00:16:18.632 --> 00:16:19.709
I mean, Mieke.

282
00:16:19.734 --> 00:16:20.850
What? That's Mieke?

283
00:16:20.882 --> 00:16:22.787
That's who you've been
writing to all this time?

284
00:16:22.823 --> 00:16:24.194
Yeah, you know, until last night,

285
00:16:24.225 --> 00:16:28.107
when I took your advice and told her
to keep her hands off my genitals.

286
00:16:28.162 --> 00:16:29.569
Well, given what we know now,

287
00:16:29.608 --> 00:16:32.444
that seems like the exact
opposite of what you want.

288
00:16:34.754 --> 00:16:36.473
This is a total disaster.

289
00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.230
Oh, come on.
It's not that bad.

290
00:16:39.598 --> 00:16:41.129
Though she is really hot.

291
00:16:41.168 --> 00:16:44.296
You're not listening. I don't
even care what she looks like.

292
00:16:44.463 --> 00:16:45.988
Mieke and I, we had this...

293
00:16:46.043 --> 00:16:47.816
incredible bond.

294
00:16:47.893 --> 00:16:50.637
I told her things I couldn't even tell you.

295
00:16:51.561 --> 00:16:52.918
Like what?

296
00:16:53.098 --> 00:16:55.059
Nothing. It's, it's a figure
of speech, Coop.

297
00:16:55.121 --> 00:16:57.043
- No, seriously. What?
- Nothing. The point is--

298
00:16:57.073 --> 00:16:58.730
- You like me better, right?
- Would you stop and listen?

299
00:16:58.771 --> 00:17:03.266
This girl is not only smart and funny,
and stunningly beautiful,

300
00:17:03.297 --> 00:17:04.437
but until I screwed up,

301
00:17:04.469 --> 00:17:07.680
she actually wanted to come all the way
to America just to be with me.

302
00:17:07.734 --> 00:17:09.226
So, do something about it.

303
00:17:09.282 --> 00:17:10.883
What can I do?

304
00:17:10.968 --> 00:17:14.250
She blocked her e-mail account,
her phone number's not listed.

305
00:17:14.321 --> 00:17:16.484
The only thing I know
is she lives in Berlin.

306
00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:18.453
So, go to Berlin.

307
00:17:19.516 --> 00:17:21.905
I can't just go to Berlin, Coop.

308
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.100
- Why not?
- Because.

309
00:17:24.169 --> 00:17:26.061
I just can't, okay?

310
00:17:26.108 --> 00:17:27.865
I'm supposed to work
for my dad this summer.

311
00:17:27.897 --> 00:17:30.209
Stuff that looks really good
on my med-school application.

312
00:17:30.256 --> 00:17:32.115
Oh, Jesus, Scotty.

313
00:17:32.177 --> 00:17:35.608
Man, Fiona was right.
You're so predictable.

314
00:17:45.067 --> 00:17:46.535
I'm going to Germany.

315
00:17:46.575 --> 00:17:49.066
No. We're going to Germany.

316
00:17:57.703 --> 00:17:59.302
How are we going to get to Germany?

317
00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.430
Don't worry.
I've got it covered.

318
00:18:04.039 --> 00:18:05.703
We're going to be couriers?

319
00:18:05.899 --> 00:18:07.531
It's the best way to get a cheap flight.

320
00:18:07.594 --> 00:18:11.258
All we have to do is carry their packages,
and then drop them off when we get there.

321
00:18:11.391 --> 00:18:12.985
My cousin did it when he went to India.

322
00:18:13.024 --> 00:18:14.110
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

323
00:18:14.164 --> 00:18:17.867
Of course, he, uh, ended up using
a public restroom in New Delhi,

324
00:18:17.899 --> 00:18:20.563
and, uh, they had to cut off his leg.

325
00:18:20.719 --> 00:18:24.062
You know, but he got there cheap,
is what I'm saying.

326
00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:27.682
Okay, I don't have anything
to Germany for a week.

327
00:18:27.733 --> 00:18:31.782
Uh, but I can get you both
to London today for $118.

328
00:18:31.813 --> 00:18:32.566
Anything else?

329
00:18:32.605 --> 00:18:34.572
Europe is like the size
of the Eastwood Mall.

330
00:18:34.619 --> 00:18:36.775
We can walk to Berlin from there.

331
00:18:37.326 --> 00:18:39.019
Cooper, England's an island.

332
00:18:39.148 --> 00:18:41.820
Okay, swim. Whatever.

333
00:18:42.206 --> 00:18:43.367
We'll take it.

334
00:18:58.256 --> 00:18:59.640
- Hey.
- Hm?

335
00:18:59.748 --> 00:19:01.405
Thanks for coming with me.

336
00:19:01.514 --> 00:19:03.894
I know you had that internship
at the law firm this summer.

337
00:19:03.943 --> 00:19:05.989
Well, forget about the law firm.

338
00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:09.567
And don't thank me.
I should be thanking you.

339
00:19:10.043 --> 00:19:13.098
This trip is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity for me...

340
00:19:13.153 --> 00:19:15.442
to broaden my sexual horizons.

341
00:19:16.106 --> 00:19:17.778
What are you talking about?

342
00:19:17.848 --> 00:19:19.871
I'm talking about
crazy European sex.

343
00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:21.036
Ah.

344
00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:24.526
You know America was founded by prudes.

345
00:19:24.551 --> 00:19:25.575
Mm.

346
00:19:25.621 --> 00:19:27.137
Prudes who left Europe...

347
00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:32.124
because they hated all the kinky,
steamy European sex that was going on.

348
00:19:32.421 --> 00:19:33.882
And now I,

349
00:19:34.281 --> 00:19:35.843
uh, Cooper Harris...

350
00:19:36.109 --> 00:19:37.491
will return to the...

351
00:19:37.569 --> 00:19:41.007
land of my perverted forefathers
and claim my birthright...

352
00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:42.697
which is a...

353
00:19:42.783 --> 00:19:47.158
series of erotic and
sexually challenging adventures.

354
00:19:48.242 --> 00:19:50.832
You've really thought a lot
about this, haven't you?

355
00:19:51.579 --> 00:19:52.941
It's my passion.

356
00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:10.280
Come on, come on.

357
00:20:12.093 --> 00:20:13.898
The adventure begins.

358
00:20:14.015 --> 00:20:16.249
Welcome to jolly old England.

359
00:20:16.289 --> 00:20:20.538
Yeah, breathe that sweet,
sexy, European air.

360
00:20:21.753 --> 00:20:23.226
- Oh.
- What is that?

361
00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:26.166
Uh, it's the phone
they gave me at the law firm.

362
00:20:26.197 --> 00:20:27.666
Yeah, it's pretty neat, huh?

363
00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.025
- Works anywhere.
- Yeah?

364
00:20:29.064 --> 00:20:30.080
Yeah.

365
00:20:30.111 --> 00:20:31.533
Excuse me.

366
00:20:32.149 --> 00:20:33.705
Cooper here.

367
00:20:33.986 --> 00:20:35.819
Hello, Mr. Walters.

368
00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:38.814
Uh, yes, sir,
I'm down in file storage.

369
00:20:39.134 --> 00:20:41.142
Uh, hang on one second.

370
00:20:46.589 --> 00:20:49.246
No, sir, I can't find
the Gutterman file anywhere.

371
00:20:49.316 --> 00:20:51.183
Yes, sir, I'll keep looking.

372
00:20:51.246 --> 00:20:53.628
No, I don't rest until I find it.

373
00:20:54.582 --> 00:20:56.636
Didn't tell your boss
you were leaving the country?

374
00:20:56.661 --> 00:20:58.261
- They would've stopped paying me.
- Right.

375
00:20:58.311 --> 00:20:59.988
It seemed easier.

376
00:21:00.456 --> 00:21:02.564
- So where to?
- Uh, I don't know.

377
00:21:02.589 --> 00:21:04.463
First bus to Berlin doesn't
leave till tomorrow.

378
00:21:04.488 --> 00:21:05.707
What do you wanna do?

379
00:21:05.753 --> 00:21:09.035
Got the Tower of London,
there's Buckingham Palace.

380
00:21:09.949 --> 00:21:11.798
- Uh...
- There's no drinking age.

381
00:21:11.823 --> 00:21:13.691
- There you go.
- Come on.

382
00:21:15.003 --> 00:21:17.402
Hey. "The Feisty Goat."

383
00:21:21.742 --> 00:21:23.292
All right.

384
00:21:23.879 --> 00:21:25.854
What do you wanna--?

385
00:21:36.116 --> 00:21:38.071
Soccer hooligans.

386
00:21:42.481 --> 00:21:45.610
Hey, this isn't where I parked my car.

387
00:21:45.971 --> 00:21:47.376
Oi!

388
00:21:48.185 --> 00:21:50.352
Who the bloody hell are you?

389
00:21:51.561 --> 00:21:53.931
This is a private members bar,

390
00:21:54.056 --> 00:21:58.735
exclusively for the supporters
of the greatest football team in the world:

391
00:21:59.009 --> 00:22:01.306
Manchester United.

392
00:22:01.602 --> 00:22:04.376
Now, please, enlighten me.

393
00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.391
Who the fuck are you?

394
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:10.102
That is a good question, and, Scotty?

395
00:22:10.322 --> 00:22:11.740
Huh?

396
00:22:14.646 --> 00:22:18.032
We're the Manchester United Fan Club...

397
00:22:18.494 --> 00:22:20.540
from Ohio.

398
00:22:20.939 --> 00:22:23.337
If you're Manchester United supporters...

399
00:22:23.427 --> 00:22:25.899
sing the Manchester United song.

400
00:22:25.962 --> 00:22:27.618
Ahem.
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

401
00:22:27.657 --> 00:22:28.790
I'm not much of a singer.

402
00:22:28.821 --> 00:22:30.431

Woo-hoo!

417
00:23:42.842 --> 00:23:44.835
is not responding.

418
00:23:45.965 --> 00:23:47.850
He was the one.

419
00:23:50.277 --> 00:23:52.850
I was going to give myself to him.

420
00:23:53.663 --> 00:23:56.874
Perhaps, you should give yourself
to someone else.

421
00:23:59.999 --> 00:24:01.751
For life.

422
00:24:22.452 --> 00:24:24.663
I'm never drinking again.

423
00:24:24.946 --> 00:24:26.624
Coop, wake up.

424
00:24:26.717 --> 00:24:30.053
Oh, man, that was a wild night.

425
00:24:32.128 --> 00:24:33.435
You think?

426
00:24:41.116 --> 00:24:43.389
Scotty, where the hell are we going?

427
00:24:43.421 --> 00:24:44.444
Don't worry.

428
00:24:44.483 --> 00:24:47.717
If anything bad happens,
my parents will find us.

429
00:24:47.772 --> 00:24:48.889
Honey?

430
00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.546
Where's Scotty?

431
00:24:50.608 --> 00:24:52.342
Cooper said they were going camping.

432
00:24:52.389 --> 00:24:53.467
Oh.

433
00:24:53.523 --> 00:24:55.273
That's nice.

434
00:24:55.822 --> 00:24:57.272
And where's Bert?

435
00:24:57.359 --> 00:24:59.061
Fuck if I know.

436
00:25:09.389 --> 00:25:11.038
Hey!

437
00:25:11.077 --> 00:25:13.320
How are you, you scalawag.

438
00:25:13.475 --> 00:25:16.030
Look, given the current
geopolitical climate...

439
00:25:16.093 --> 00:25:18.921
all European countries
should have a seat at the table.

440
00:25:18.999 --> 00:25:21.730
- Right.
- Except those fucking Ities.

441
00:25:21.787 --> 00:25:23.999
I hate them Italian bastards.

442
00:25:24.093 --> 00:25:26.014
- You know what I mean?
- Excuse me.

443
00:25:26.077 --> 00:25:27.250
Hello, boy-o.

444
00:25:27.288 --> 00:25:29.241
So, what the hell happened last night?

445
00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.952
You got steamed up,
pissed as a fart.

446
00:25:31.998 --> 00:25:33.741
Too much sauce, son.

447
00:25:34.116 --> 00:25:36.374
Don't worry.
We come and got you,

448
00:25:36.413 --> 00:25:38.007
so you wouldn't miss the trip.

449
00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:39.632
What, what trip?

450
00:25:39.679 --> 00:25:40.718
What trip?

451
00:25:40.764 --> 00:25:41.866
Where are we going?

452
00:25:41.909 --> 00:25:43.218
What you mean,
where are we going?

453
00:25:43.249 --> 00:25:46.335
We're going to see the Mighty Reds
do the frogs in Paris.

454
00:25:46.366 --> 00:25:47.436
Aren't we, boys?

455
00:25:47.483 --> 00:25:49.905
Yeah.

456
00:25:49.968 --> 00:25:51.772
Why are you yelling at me?

457
00:25:51.827 --> 00:25:54.452
So, I tell the swamp donkey to sack it...

458
00:25:54.499 --> 00:25:57.173
before I give her a tonk in
the tradesman's entrance...

459
00:25:57.204 --> 00:25:59.733
and have her lick me yarbles.

460
00:26:01.618 --> 00:26:03.063
Wow.

461
00:26:03.316 --> 00:26:06.633
You guys are on like a completely
different level of swearing over here.

462
00:26:06.711 --> 00:26:07.739
Coop?

463
00:26:07.778 --> 00:26:09.646
Cooper, we're going to Paris.

464
00:26:09.708 --> 00:26:11.318
I know. Cecil told me.

465
00:26:11.364 --> 00:26:12.607
Mieke's in Berlin.

466
00:26:12.653 --> 00:26:14.318
We're not going to Berlin.

467
00:26:14.349 --> 00:26:15.974
What are we gonna do?
We need a plan.

468
00:26:16.028 --> 00:26:19.544
Right. See what I'm talking about?
This is predictable Scotty talking.

469
00:26:19.732 --> 00:26:20.794
Relax.

470
00:26:20.825 --> 00:26:24.599
Paris is practically a suburb of Berlin.
It's a nothing commute.

471
00:26:24.763 --> 00:26:27.091
This is why France and Germany
have always been allies.

472
00:26:27.149 --> 00:26:28.364
Allies.

473
00:26:28.412 --> 00:26:29.888
What?

474
00:26:30.862 --> 00:26:31.948
The twins.

475
00:26:31.996 --> 00:26:33.792
The twins were in Paris, right?

476
00:26:33.862 --> 00:26:35.305
We could give them a call.
They could help us out.

477
00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:36.800
Let me see your phone.
I'll give them a call.

478
00:26:36.839 --> 00:26:40.284
All right, but I'm really only supposed
to use this for business calls.

479
00:26:40.521 --> 00:26:42.075
Hey, don't--

480
00:26:58.782 --> 00:26:59.876
Come on!

481
00:26:59.908 --> 00:27:02.806
You're on the wrong side of the road,
you snail-eating poofs.

482
00:27:02.837 --> 00:27:03.868
Fuck off!

483
00:27:03.915 --> 00:27:07.298
Go on, you Gaelic
fucking garlic-breath tossers.

484
00:27:07.402 --> 00:27:12.324
Piss off! Get in here and say that,
you froggy, Itie shities.

485
00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.238
Fucking beep.

486
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:20.153
We'll beep, you bastard,
all over your fucking nose.

487
00:27:20.223 --> 00:27:22.934
Get out of the way!
Piss off!

488
00:27:30.419 --> 00:27:31.615
Hey, lads.

489
00:27:31.678 --> 00:27:34.193
That wanker's got a frog football shirt on.

490
00:27:34.279 --> 00:27:36.948
Let's give this Nancy
a fucking good kicking.

491
00:27:37.068 --> 00:27:38.185
Come on, lads.

492
00:27:38.248 --> 00:27:39.646
He's going off.

493
00:27:54.075 --> 00:27:55.091
All right.

494
00:27:55.122 --> 00:27:57.051
Twins said they'd meet us here.

495
00:27:57.153 --> 00:27:58.293
- Hey.
- Oh, look at that.

496
00:27:58.318 --> 00:27:59.336
There they are. Come on.

497
00:27:59.367 --> 00:28:00.453
Jenny!

498
00:28:00.484 --> 00:28:02.176
- Jamie.
- Hey.

499
00:28:02.215 --> 00:28:03.504
Come here.

500
00:28:03.554 --> 00:28:06.703
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- Scott, bienvenue a Paris.

501
00:28:06.746 --> 00:28:08.953
Thank you, thank you.
What is that a new camera?

502
00:28:09.015 --> 00:28:12.140
This isn't just a camera.
This is a Leica M7.

503
00:28:12.211 --> 00:28:16.000
Über-sensitive exposure settings,
legendary cloth-shutter system.

504
00:28:16.039 --> 00:28:17.468
Let me see that thing.

505
00:28:17.555 --> 00:28:18.703
No can do.

506
00:28:18.758 --> 00:28:22.086
I spent the last four years tutoring
lacrosse players just to pay for it,

507
00:28:22.265 --> 00:28:24.859
so nobody touches my camera, but me.

508
00:28:24.913 --> 00:28:26.164
So, it's like your Wiener.

509
00:28:26.211 --> 00:28:27.328
No, it's not like my--

510
00:28:27.367 --> 00:28:29.455
- Jenny.
- Cooper, leave him alone.

511
00:28:29.502 --> 00:28:32.971
Wow, Scotty, I still can't believe
you came all the way to Europe for a girl.

512
00:28:33.009 --> 00:28:36.611
Oh, wait, no, not just any girl.
Show, show her the picture, Scotty.

513
00:28:36.664 --> 00:28:39.650
She makes every girl in
our high school look like a walrus.

514
00:28:39.752 --> 00:28:41.541
I'm a girl from your high school.

515
00:28:41.604 --> 00:28:43.353
No, I mean "girl" girls.

516
00:28:43.506 --> 00:28:45.924
Guys, we're wasting the whole day here.
We're in Paris.

517
00:28:45.977 --> 00:28:47.385
Let's go to the Louvre.

518
00:28:47.436 --> 00:28:49.627
To the Louvre.

519
00:29:23.859 --> 00:29:25.553
So, you guys wanna stay here...

520
00:29:25.585 --> 00:29:28.592
or should we check out
the huge line at the Eiffel Tower?

521
00:29:28.694 --> 00:29:29.788
Here's a fun fact.

522
00:29:29.827 --> 00:29:32.585
Voltaire contracted syphilis
just two blocks from here.

523
00:29:32.655 --> 00:29:33.678
Should we go?

524
00:29:33.717 --> 00:29:36.944
Can we please just get out of here?
This guy's really creeping me out.

525
00:29:37.053 --> 00:29:38.538
Who, robot man?

526
00:29:38.671 --> 00:29:40.717
He's just trying to feed his robot family.

527
00:29:40.764 --> 00:29:42.491
I, I really think I don't like him.

528
00:29:42.546 --> 00:29:43.577
Why?

529
00:29:43.602 --> 00:29:44.858
Because he's doing this?

530
00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:47.303
All right.

531
00:29:47.335 --> 00:29:48.717
Okay, seriously, don't do that.

532
00:29:48.764 --> 00:29:51.046
Cooper, do not hate me.

533
00:29:53.887 --> 00:29:58.635
I am familiar with over 600 dance
moves and I am programmed to get:

534
00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:03.630
Freaky.

535
00:30:16.122 --> 00:30:18.606
You're just upset because
people like me better.

536
00:30:18.653 --> 00:30:19.755
It's okay.

537
00:30:45.401 --> 00:30:46.597
Oh.

538
00:30:59.838 --> 00:31:01.489
Fight! Fight!

539
00:31:05.685 --> 00:31:07.617
Break the leg, Scott.

540
00:31:24.141 --> 00:31:27.274
Don't look in his eyes, Scotty.
Don't look in his eyes!

541
00:31:31.868 --> 00:31:34.697
- Oh, no!
- Oh, that was not cool.

542
00:31:59.396 --> 00:32:01.631
- Ooh!
- Oooh!

543
00:32:05.664 --> 00:32:08.015
Guys, let's go. Come on.

544
00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:14.124
Error. Error. Error.

545
00:32:15.991 --> 00:32:17.741
How cool is this?

546
00:32:17.913 --> 00:32:20.234
It's a shame that we only get
to spend one day together.

547
00:32:20.288 --> 00:32:21.960
Why don't you come to Berlin with us?

548
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.031
- Mm, no.
- Jamie, come on.

549
00:32:24.077 --> 00:32:26.273
In a few months,
we're all going to different colleges.

550
00:32:26.298 --> 00:32:29.382
This could be the last chance that
the four of us are together like this.

551
00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:31.093
Plus, we're in Europe.

552
00:32:31.156 --> 00:32:32.328
Huh?

553
00:32:32.366 --> 00:32:34.366
This should be the trip of a lifetime.

554
00:32:34.443 --> 00:32:36.921
There's no way we should split up.

555
00:32:37.219 --> 00:32:38.960
All right, this table is now Europe.

556
00:32:39.023 --> 00:32:40.280
Okay?

557
00:32:40.523 --> 00:32:42.616
- Ahem. Excuse me.
- Great.

558
00:32:42.812 --> 00:32:44.679
We are right here,

559
00:32:44.726 --> 00:32:48.126
in Paris, and I have got
to get to Mieke,

560
00:32:48.205 --> 00:32:50.455
who is over here, in Berlin.

561
00:32:50.552 --> 00:32:53.322
And Jamie, if you come with us,
I'm sure there's a ton of great stuff

562
00:32:53.354 --> 00:32:55.564
that you can see right along the way.

563
00:32:55.759 --> 00:32:58.650
- We can go to Denmark.
- I love Denmark.

564
00:32:59.072 --> 00:33:00.251
We gotta hit Amsterdam.

565
00:33:00.307 --> 00:33:01.759
- Definitely.
- Ah.

566
00:33:02.025 --> 00:33:04.384
And the cathedral at Cameret.

567
00:33:05.947 --> 00:33:06.980
- Yeah.
- Maybe.

568
00:33:07.011 --> 00:33:07.832
- Maybe.
- We'll see.

569
00:33:07.874 --> 00:33:10.339
- Whatever.
- If there's time.

570
00:33:11.681 --> 00:33:14.785
Come on. I really want you
to be there when I meet Mieke.

571
00:33:15.254 --> 00:33:16.129
Fine.

572
00:33:16.176 --> 00:33:17.043
- Excellent.
- Nice.

573
00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:18.090
All right.

574
00:33:18.115 --> 00:33:18.902
A toast.
- Yes.

575
00:33:18.927 --> 00:33:19.957
- A toast.
- Yes.

576
00:33:19.989 --> 00:33:21.121
Ahem.

577
00:33:21.168 --> 00:33:22.348
To Mieke.

578
00:33:22.395 --> 00:33:23.527
To Europe.

579
00:33:23.571 --> 00:33:24.906
To Europe!

580
00:33:25.379 --> 00:33:26.895
Merci.
( Thank you.)

581
00:33:27.723 --> 00:33:29.894
Berlin, here we come.

582
00:33:29.996 --> 00:33:32.879
- All right.
- You better let me hold on to those.

583
00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:38.853
What the hell is that?

584
00:33:38.897 --> 00:33:40.318
It's a traveler's money belt.

585
00:33:40.357 --> 00:33:42.217
Frommer's says as long as
you have one of these...

586
00:33:42.256 --> 00:33:44.342
no one can rob you of anything.

587
00:33:44.428 --> 00:33:45.936
Except your dignity.

588
00:33:46.012 --> 00:33:48.068
No, you just put that in your--

589
00:33:48.529 --> 00:33:49.990
Wait, what?

590
00:33:50.328 --> 00:33:51.811
Come on, Guidebook.

591
00:33:51.857 --> 00:33:53.178
Let's go.

592
00:33:55.184 --> 00:33:56.833
Check it out.

593
00:33:57.104 --> 00:33:59.458
European ass.

594
00:34:01.464 --> 00:34:03.076
What's up?

595
00:34:05.628 --> 00:34:08.967
Oh, Jesus, Jenny.
I thought you were some...

596
00:34:09.457 --> 00:34:11.959
girl. Come on. Platform 4.

597
00:34:12.202 --> 00:34:13.818
Thanks.

598
00:34:15.549 --> 00:34:16.990
Damn.

599
00:34:20.131 --> 00:34:22.142
I believe this is yours.

600
00:34:26.071 --> 00:34:27.556
Pleased to meet you.

601
00:34:27.608 --> 00:34:29.282
My name is Christoph.

602
00:34:29.345 --> 00:34:32.204
- Jenny, let's go!
- Come on, move it!

603
00:34:32.657 --> 00:34:34.909
Those are my friends.
We're supposed to get on a train...

604
00:34:34.949 --> 00:34:36.503
- to Berlin, and--
- Jenny!

605
00:34:36.534 --> 00:34:38.315
I'm coming!

606
00:34:38.737 --> 00:34:41.214
So, it was really nice to meet you.

607
00:34:41.511 --> 00:34:43.596
The pleasure was all mine.

608
00:34:45.144 --> 00:34:46.585

- Buongiorno. (Good morning.)

00:35:59.313 --> 00:36:00.753
Buongiorno.
(Good morning.)

622
00:36:08.646 --> 00:36:12.073
You know, there are a lot of other
empty compartments.

623
00:36:12.225 --> 00:36:13.351
Huh?

624
00:36:13.659 --> 00:36:14.792
Ah.

625
00:36:14.863 --> 00:36:16.996
Si. Si.
( Yes. Yes.)

626
00:36:50.307 --> 00:36:51.556
Pardon me.

627
00:36:51.822 --> 00:36:53.001
Eh?

628
00:36:54.231 --> 00:36:55.407
Oh.

629
00:36:56.054 --> 00:36:57.625
Mi scusi.
(Excuse me.)

630
00:36:58.508 --> 00:37:00.140
Mi scusi!.
(Excuse me!)

631
00:37:06.094 --> 00:37:07.367
Oh, ow!

632
00:37:25.068 --> 00:37:26.195
Hi.

633
00:37:26.468 --> 00:37:27.999
Buongiorno.
(Good morning.)

634
00:37:39.926 --> 00:37:41.395
What, what the hell are you doing?

635
00:37:41.442 --> 00:37:43.638
Oh, mi scusi, mi scusi.

636
00:37:43.851 --> 00:37:45.356
Ah, no! No, no, no, no, no.

637
00:37:45.388 --> 00:37:47.317
Mi scusi, mi scusi, mi scusi.

638
00:37:47.387 --> 00:37:48.395
Uh-oh.

639
00:37:48.450 --> 00:37:50.317
- What?
- Big tunnel.

640
00:37:53.897 --> 00:37:54.921
Who's touching me?

641
00:37:54.991 --> 00:37:56.217
Scotty, is that you?

642
00:37:56.242 --> 00:37:57.327
- Who's in there?
- Where?

643
00:37:57.374 --> 00:37:58.546
- Who's touching me?
- Scotty?

644
00:37:58.600 --> 00:37:59.631
Scotty!

645
00:38:04.785 --> 00:38:06.605
Oh! Oh!

646
00:38:08.504 --> 00:38:09.926
Mi scusi.

647
00:38:25.669 --> 00:38:28.182
Crane Sur Mer.
We change trains here.

648
00:38:30.054 --> 00:38:31.093
Well,

649
00:38:31.148 --> 00:38:32.898
we got a couple of hours to kill.

650
00:38:32.937 --> 00:38:34.733
What's there to see in this town?

651
00:38:34.772 --> 00:38:35.812
Hello?

652
00:38:35.875 --> 00:38:37.757
The Monument des Poissonières.

653
00:38:37.814 --> 00:38:41.136
It's a monument to all the local
fishermen that were lost at sea.

654
00:38:41.238 --> 00:38:44.167
Frommer's says it's supposed
to be quite moving.

655
00:38:44.214 --> 00:38:47.373
What the hell is wrong
with you, C-3PO?

656
00:38:47.441 --> 00:38:50.599
We're here to see Europe,
not some crappy statue.

657
00:38:50.853 --> 00:38:52.263
I'm taking a nap.

658
00:38:52.436 --> 00:38:54.514
Wake me up when the train gets here.

659
00:38:54.583 --> 00:38:55.592
Hm.

660
00:38:55.655 --> 00:38:57.561
Says here, this town has
a famous nude beach.

661
00:38:57.592 --> 00:39:00.342
All right, look, we can't
all just lie around all day.

662
00:39:00.367 --> 00:39:03.092
We gotta get out there and
experience the culture firsthand.

663
00:39:03.123 --> 00:39:05.185
Let's go exploring.

664
00:39:08.029 --> 00:39:10.497
So, what's the etiquette on boners?

665
00:39:10.703 --> 00:39:15.614
Do I roll over and dig out a hole for it
or is it cool to just let my flag fly?

666
00:39:16.014 --> 00:39:18.138
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

667
00:39:18.232 --> 00:39:20.818
Does "nude beach" mean
we have to get naked too?

668
00:39:20.938 --> 00:39:22.435
Of course.

669
00:39:22.531 --> 00:39:26.169
Do you think you can go an hour
without your currency colostomy bag?

670
00:39:26.228 --> 00:39:29.716
Hey, hey, as long as this thing has
our money and passports in it,

671
00:39:29.785 --> 00:39:31.013
it's not coming off.

672
00:39:31.052 --> 00:39:33.154
And I don't think my trunks
are coming off, either.

673
00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:34.810
No, come on, Jamie.

674
00:39:34.865 --> 00:39:36.669
You came all the way to Europe.

675
00:39:36.732 --> 00:39:38.724
Can't wimp out now.

676
00:39:40.644 --> 00:39:41.835
Okay.

677
00:39:41.925 --> 00:39:43.699
All right, on the count of three.

678
00:39:43.738 --> 00:39:45.011
- Here we go.
- Ahem.

679
00:39:45.051 --> 00:39:47.019
Three, two, one...

680
00:39:47.183 --> 00:39:49.394
Look at Jamie's penis.

681
00:39:49.433 --> 00:39:50.644
Very funny.

682
00:39:50.691 --> 00:39:52.543
- Very funny.
- All right, all right.

683
00:39:52.613 --> 00:39:54.101
Ahem.

684
00:39:54.268 --> 00:39:57.191
Let the crazy, European sex odyssey begin.

685
00:39:57.238 --> 00:39:58.417
- Here we go.
- Really?

686
00:39:58.455 --> 00:39:59.769
- Yes.
- Mm-hm.

687
00:40:02.987 --> 00:40:04.229
Woo-hoo!

688
00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:07.314
Hello, ladies.

689
00:40:11.783 --> 00:40:13.408
Ladies?

690
00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:14.932
Bitches?

691
00:40:15.135 --> 00:40:16.729
Ew. What a rip!

692
00:40:16.792 --> 00:40:20.127
There's no nude girls here,
just guys like us looking for nude girls.

693
00:40:20.169 --> 00:40:21.814
I don't understand.

694
00:40:22.275 --> 00:40:25.580
"Evans Sur Met has one of the best
nude beaches on the continent.

695
00:40:25.695 --> 00:40:27.439
"However...

696
00:40:30.408 --> 00:40:31.579
during the summer months,

697
00:40:31.610 --> 00:40:34.842
"all the European women are
chased away by gawking male tourists,

698
00:40:34.892 --> 00:40:37.275
"so Europe's most nubile exhibitionists...

699
00:40:37.314 --> 00:40:41.181
"head to the deserted beach right next
to the Monument des Poissonières."

700
00:40:57.353 --> 00:41:00.552
There's so many penises.

701
00:41:00.693 --> 00:41:02.341
Frommer's tried to tell you,

702
00:41:02.419 --> 00:41:03.841
but you just didn't listen.

703
00:41:03.911 --> 00:41:06.099
This is the biggest sausage fest on earth.

704
00:41:06.153 --> 00:41:08.661
It's the International House of Sausage.

705
00:41:08.785 --> 00:41:10.042
Hey.

706
00:41:11.761 --> 00:41:13.331
Thanks for waiting.

707
00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:15.160
Well, it's not like
you're missing anything.

708
00:41:15.191 --> 00:41:16.793
It's all guys.

709
00:41:16.946 --> 00:41:17.988
Hm.

710
00:41:18.035 --> 00:41:19.910
At least, the sun's out.

711
00:41:47.173 --> 00:41:48.666
Holy crap!

712
00:41:48.755 --> 00:41:51.416
What? I thought
this was a nude beach.

713
00:41:51.845 --> 00:41:57.638
No!

714
00:41:58.364 --> 00:41:59.185
- Huh?
- No, no.

715
00:41:59.216 --> 00:42:00.115
- No. No.
- What? What?

716
00:42:00.144 --> 00:42:01.903
- No, Jenny. Jenny, you gotta cover up.
- What are you doing?

717
00:42:01.935 --> 00:42:03.427
- Cover up, cover up, cover up.
- Why?

718
00:42:03.458 --> 00:42:05.060
- Girl.
- Girl?

719
00:42:05.161 --> 00:42:06.614
Girl.

720
00:42:06.918 --> 00:42:08.099
Ooh, girl.

721
00:42:08.154 --> 00:42:09.302
Girl.

722
00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:11.185
Ooh, girl.

723
00:42:11.316 --> 00:42:12.646
Girl.

724
00:42:12.685 --> 00:42:14.068
Girl.

725
00:42:14.124 --> 00:42:15.388
Run.

726
00:42:16.101 --> 00:42:17.194
Girl.

727
00:42:17.585 --> 00:42:18.718
Girl.

728
00:42:18.788 --> 00:42:20.101
Girl.

729
00:42:20.147 --> 00:42:21.410
Girl.

730
00:42:21.435 --> 00:42:22.440
Girl.

731
00:42:22.465 --> 00:42:23.738
- I'm not gonna make it.
- Girl.

732
00:42:23.779 --> 00:42:26.324
- Go on without me.
- All right. See you.

733
00:42:29.737 --> 00:42:31.831
Chica. Chica.
( Girl. Girl.)

734
00:42:38.972 --> 00:42:40.332
Chica.
( Girl.)

735
00:42:40.426 --> 00:42:41.934
Chica.
( Girl.)

736
00:42:50.806 --> 00:42:53.517
Are you reading, uh,
Mieke's old e-mails again?

737
00:42:53.598 --> 00:42:55.392
Mm-hm. Yeah.

738
00:42:56.898 --> 00:43:01.071
I have no idea what I'm going
to say to that girl when I see her.

739
00:43:02.066 --> 00:43:04.689
You know, she said
I might be the one?

740
00:43:05.276 --> 00:43:06.844
That's huge.

741
00:43:07.257 --> 00:43:09.618
I've never been "the one" before.

742
00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:13.704
Thought maybe I was "the one" with Fiona,
but turns out I was, like what?

743
00:43:13.751 --> 00:43:14.548
101?

744
00:43:14.575 --> 00:43:16.509
- Two hundred.
- Two hundred.

745
00:43:17.025 --> 00:43:19.525
Look, you got nothing to worry about.

746
00:43:19.593 --> 00:43:23.048
You'll show up and sweep
her off her German feet.

747
00:43:24.563 --> 00:43:25.892
Thanks.

748
00:43:33.659 --> 00:43:34.940
Yeah.

749
00:43:36.148 --> 00:43:38.025
I will, won't I?

750
00:43:40.829 --> 00:43:43.102
I'm so sad and lonely.

751
00:43:43.451 --> 00:43:47.955
I just wish someone would show up
and sweep me off my German feet.

752
00:43:48.559 --> 00:43:49.905
Mieke.

753
00:43:49.968 --> 00:43:51.077
I'm here.

754
00:43:51.116 --> 00:43:52.132
Scotty.

755
00:43:52.163 --> 00:43:53.811
Mieke, listen, about that last e-mail,

756
00:43:53.850 --> 00:43:56.405
- I'm so sorry that I--
- The past is the past.

757
00:43:56.546 --> 00:43:58.116
You're here now.

758
00:43:58.183 --> 00:44:00.999
I've been saving myself for you.

759
00:44:01.724 --> 00:44:03.436
Let us make love...

760
00:44:03.522 --> 00:44:05.304
for one whole month.

761
00:44:09.004 --> 00:44:11.061
Touch me, Scotty.

762
00:44:14.108 --> 00:44:15.420
Okay.

763
00:44:34.054 --> 00:44:35.931
Oh, Scotty.

764
00:44:36.628 --> 00:44:38.488
Mi bello.
( My handsome.)

765
00:44:39.488 --> 00:44:41.440
Mi bello.
(My handsome.)

766
00:44:41.656 --> 00:44:44.013
Mi bello.
(My handsome.)

767
00:44:45.514 --> 00:44:47.842
Mi bello.
(My handsome.)

768
00:44:48.772 --> 00:44:50.467
Mi bello.
(My handsome.)

769
00:44:56.439 --> 00:44:57.978
Oh, mi scusi.
(Oh, pardon me.)

770
00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:33.766
Hey, guys, our train doesn't leave
until tomorrow morning.

771
00:45:33.805 --> 00:45:35.360
Where are we gonna sleep tonight?

772
00:45:35.413 --> 00:45:37.110
What do you mean, sleep?

773
00:45:37.167 --> 00:45:39.110
We can sleep on the train tomorrow.

774
00:45:39.157 --> 00:45:40.774
This is the best thing
that could've happened to us.

775
00:45:40.813 --> 00:45:42.250
We're in Amsterdam.

776
00:45:42.305 --> 00:45:45.369
This is the drug and sex capital of Europe.

777
00:45:45.758 --> 00:45:47.454
Take a look at this.

778
00:45:49.927 --> 00:45:52.578
"Club Vandersexxx."

779
00:45:52.641 --> 00:45:55.641
It's "The Red Light District's
hottest sex club."

780
00:45:55.734 --> 00:45:58.367
We have to check it out.
Who's with me?

781
00:45:58.570 --> 00:45:59.883
<i>I'll go.</i>

782
00:46:00.336 --> 00:46:02.828
Fine. Since no one else
is willing to go,

783
00:46:02.867 --> 00:46:04.648
I'll just go myself.

784
00:46:25.694 --> 00:46:28.993
This is definitely
where I parked my car.

785
00:46:31.685 --> 00:46:33.298
Hello there.

786
00:46:35.523 --> 00:46:37.883
Welcome to Club Vandersexxx,

787
00:46:37.968 --> 00:46:40.773
Amsterdam's most erotic club...

788
00:46:40.882 --> 00:46:44.351
where your every fantasy will be fulfilled.

789
00:46:44.516 --> 00:46:47.502
Also says I get a free T-shirt with flyer.

790
00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:51.948
He's American.

791
00:46:52.182 --> 00:46:57.238
How sad for you to grow up
in a country founded by prudes.

792
00:46:57.308 --> 00:47:00.762
A country overrun
with crime and illiteracy.

793
00:47:01.223 --> 00:47:02.527
A country where...

794
00:47:02.574 --> 00:47:05.910
a man is forced to make sex
to only one woman at a time...

795
00:47:05.939 --> 00:47:09.301
and one must learn
the woman's name beforehand.

796
00:47:09.386 --> 00:47:12.317
- It was horrible.
- I know.

797
00:47:12.515 --> 00:47:15.004
But you can come with me...

798
00:47:15.174 --> 00:47:18.433
and let the Vandersexxx begin.

799
00:47:27.897 --> 00:47:29.765
I can't believe we're doing this.

800
00:47:29.819 --> 00:47:30.850
Don't worry.

801
00:47:30.889 --> 00:47:33.756
Hash brownies are totally legal here.

802
00:47:34.507 --> 00:47:37.726
You're gonna enjoy these, man.
These are magical.

803
00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:44.061
- You wanna do this?
- Yeah.

804
00:47:44.085 --> 00:47:45.944
- Uh-huh.
- Hm.

805
00:47:50.077 --> 00:47:51.454
- Hi.
- Hi.

806
00:47:51.563 --> 00:47:53.767
I need a new battery for my camera,

807
00:47:53.829 --> 00:47:56.876
and while you're at it,
it could also use a thorough cleaning.

808
00:47:57.012 --> 00:47:58.597
Wow.

809
00:47:58.967 --> 00:48:00.944
Is that a Leica M6?

810
00:48:01.006 --> 00:48:02.350
Actually, it's an M7.

811
00:48:02.406 --> 00:48:04.575
It's got the built-in light meter.

812
00:48:05.391 --> 00:48:07.248
It's so beautiful.

813
00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:10.451
So sleek, so powerful.

814
00:48:11.022 --> 00:48:12.670
How's the new lens system?

815
00:48:14.186 --> 00:48:16.912
Makes the Nikon look like a disposable.

816
00:48:17.357 --> 00:48:19.709
You really know your cameras.

817
00:48:20.662 --> 00:48:22.162
And you're very cute.

818
00:48:22.207 --> 00:48:23.522
Me?

819
00:48:23.671 --> 00:48:25.108
Really?

820
00:48:25.561 --> 00:48:27.209
I'm going on break.

821
00:48:27.304 --> 00:48:29.826
I was going to step out
back and have a cigarette.

822
00:48:30.041 --> 00:48:32.053
Would you like to join me?

823
00:48:32.782 --> 00:48:34.623
I don't smoke.

824
00:48:35.324 --> 00:48:36.576
Neither do I.

825
00:48:43.785 --> 00:48:45.535
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

826
00:48:45.619 --> 00:48:47.059
What is it?

827
00:48:47.402 --> 00:48:49.090
This is great.

828
00:48:49.436 --> 00:48:51.301
You're so innocent.

829
00:48:52.368 --> 00:48:54.980
Let's change that, shall we?

830
00:48:57.154 --> 00:48:59.084
What would you like me to do?

831
00:48:59.279 --> 00:49:01.670
Well, woo, well, I don't really know.

832
00:49:01.709 --> 00:49:03.740
I guess, I guess,
I haven't really done that much.

833
00:49:03.818 --> 00:49:08.140
Um, I haven't really found the time,
with all my formal extracurriculars and...

834
00:49:08.211 --> 00:49:09.578
model U.N.,

835
00:49:09.625 --> 00:49:12.679
advanced placement classes,
after-school tutoring...

836
00:49:12.721 --> 00:49:14.000
Oh.

837
00:49:15.469 --> 00:49:18.013
Gosh, you really like cameras.

838
00:49:18.122 --> 00:49:22.739
Sometimes, we find that our clients are
so overwhelmed with the pleasure that...

839
00:49:22.794 --> 00:49:24.981
they sometimes scream out, "no"...

840
00:49:25.035 --> 00:49:27.833
- when really they mean "yes."
- Huh.

841
00:49:28.594 --> 00:49:31.044
And this is why we have the safe word.

842
00:49:32.304 --> 00:49:34.075
The safe word?

843
00:49:34.702 --> 00:49:37.449
If at any time,
the ecstasy gets too great,

844
00:49:37.474 --> 00:49:39.693
you just use the safe word.

845
00:49:39.802 --> 00:49:40.833
Mm-hm.

846
00:49:40.872 --> 00:49:42.591
Until we hear the safe word,

847
00:49:42.677 --> 00:49:44.404
we will not stop.

848
00:49:44.746 --> 00:49:47.497
Yeah, right.
Stop. All right.

849
00:49:47.771 --> 00:49:49.872
We're going to start slowly,

850
00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:51.715
teasing you...

851
00:49:51.787 --> 00:49:54.521
with a little light erotic foreplay.

852
00:49:54.576 --> 00:49:56.200
Whee.

853
00:49:56.286 --> 00:49:59.880
Oh, oh, yes, ladies.

854
00:49:59.935 --> 00:50:02.513
On, on, Vandersexxx!

855
00:50:09.513 --> 00:50:10.654
Hans.

856
00:50:10.709 --> 00:50:12.131
Gruber.

857
00:50:15.632 --> 00:50:17.041
Hi.

858
00:50:27.651 --> 00:50:30.685
So, are the girls coming back?

859
00:50:30.786 --> 00:50:33.599
Administer the testicle clamps!

860
00:50:33.664 --> 00:50:34.974
Huh? What?

861
00:50:35.037 --> 00:50:36.177
Hey!

862
00:50:42.646 --> 00:50:44.146
Safe word.

863
00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:52.781
What is that?

864
00:50:52.844 --> 00:50:54.531
That's not a word.
That's a...

865
00:50:54.656 --> 00:50:56.906
Fluggen-kliggin-kien?

866
00:50:56.985 --> 00:50:59.789
Fluggen.
Ow! Ow ow ow!

867
00:50:59.823 --> 00:51:02.026
Scotty!

868
00:51:02.076 --> 00:51:03.708
Oh, aah.

869
00:51:04.208 --> 00:51:06.482
Aah, oh, oh.

870
00:51:07.442 --> 00:51:08.809
Okay, mister, don't move.

871
00:51:08.856 --> 00:51:10.966
- Excuse me?
- Shut the hell up.

872
00:51:11.122 --> 00:51:12.927
Oh, brother!
Please, don't hurt me.

873
00:51:13.025 --> 00:51:14.934
Oh, no.
No, you, you're fine.

874
00:51:14.974 --> 00:51:16.380
That's good. You're fine.

875
00:51:16.419 --> 00:51:18.278
Give me cash? You got cash?
Give me cash?

876
00:51:18.334 --> 00:51:20.989
Oh, take it all, you dirty girl.

877
00:51:21.204 --> 00:51:22.231
What?

878
00:51:22.279 --> 00:51:24.302
Your wallet. Focus.

879
00:51:25.653 --> 00:51:27.836
- Give it to me.
- Oh.

880
00:51:28.003 --> 00:51:29.934
Oh, I love you.

881
00:51:30.137 --> 00:51:31.465
I love you.

882
00:51:31.552 --> 00:51:34.630
I love, I love you.

883
00:51:34.666 --> 00:51:38.005
I love you.

884
00:51:49.147 --> 00:51:51.076
What's so funny?

885
00:51:58.586 --> 00:52:00.773
Mm. I'm really hungry.

886
00:52:00.828 --> 00:52:02.781
I think I've got the munchies.

887
00:52:02.954 --> 00:52:04.468
- Excuse me.
- Huh?

888
00:52:06.554 --> 00:52:08.765
It's hot in here. You hot?
Because I'm really hot.

889
00:52:08.804 --> 00:52:09.867
Mm, so good.

890
00:52:09.922 --> 00:52:11.719
Okay, I can't breathe. God!

891
00:52:11.757 --> 00:52:12.984
God! I'm freaking out.

892
00:52:13.023 --> 00:52:15.265
And I think we got a bad batch
because I'm freaking out.

893
00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:17.562
I can't, I can't do this.

894
00:52:17.784 --> 00:52:19.890
- I saw a gay porno once.
- Mm.

895
00:52:19.929 --> 00:52:21.921
- I didn't know until halfway in.
- Huh?

896
00:52:22.029 --> 00:52:23.694
The girls never came.

897
00:52:23.781 --> 00:52:25.547
The girls never came.

898
00:52:25.625 --> 00:52:27.992
I am freaking out!

899
00:52:28.054 --> 00:52:29.068
Oh oh.

900
00:52:29.093 --> 00:52:30.640
Is everything all right with you, man?

901
00:52:30.688 --> 00:52:32.281
No, nothing's all right.

902
00:52:32.328 --> 00:52:34.257
You sold us a bad batch of hash brownies.

903
00:52:34.313 --> 00:52:36.438
You're a bad, bad Rastafarian.

904
00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:39.304
These are not hash brownies.

905
00:52:39.628 --> 00:52:41.054
Hm?

906
00:52:42.250 --> 00:52:43.289
What was that?

907
00:52:43.328 --> 00:52:45.609
We do not sell hash brownies here.

908
00:52:45.635 --> 00:52:48.039
We're a simple Dutch bakery.

909
00:52:51.597 --> 00:52:54.050
Now, put your clothes back on, white boy.

910
00:52:55.159 --> 00:52:57.909
Ow ow ow ow ah!

911
00:52:57.965 --> 00:53:00.613
"Fluggengegeholen."
(Flight fetched.)

912
00:53:01.902 --> 00:53:04.211
Did you say fluggegecheimen?
(flight germs.)

913
00:53:04.259 --> 00:53:05.643
Yes, yes.

914
00:53:05.667 --> 00:53:08.480
For the love of God, fluggengecheimen.

915
00:53:08.713 --> 00:53:09.987
Are you sure?

916
00:53:10.058 --> 00:53:11.761
Yes, please.

917
00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:13.643
As you wish.

918
00:53:14.661 --> 00:53:16.948
Bring on the fluggegecheimen!

919
00:53:19.697 --> 00:53:21.901
Wait, what? What?

920
00:53:22.113 --> 00:53:23.604
Uh-oh.

921
00:53:24.612 --> 00:53:25.940
No, no, no, no, no, no.

922
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:27.368
I didn't say fluggegecheimen.

923
00:53:27.393 --> 00:53:28.582
I said, uh:

924
00:53:48.786 --> 00:53:50.877
What'd you do last night?

925
00:53:52.629 --> 00:53:54.705
I don't want to talk about it.

926
00:53:55.002 --> 00:53:56.291
What did you guys do?

927
00:53:56.335 --> 00:53:58.815
- Don't want to talk about it.
- Don't want to talk about it.

928
00:54:00.736 --> 00:54:02.315
What is that?

929
00:54:02.964 --> 00:54:04.370
Free T-shirt.

930
00:54:09.299 --> 00:54:10.635
Hey, guys.

931
00:54:12.224 --> 00:54:13.653
What happened to you?

932
00:54:13.755 --> 00:54:15.255
I got robbed.

933
00:54:15.656 --> 00:54:17.763
It was awesome.

934
00:54:18.958 --> 00:54:23.575
All our money, our passports,
our tickets, everything, gone.

935
00:54:25.005 --> 00:54:26.810
How the hell could this happen?

936
00:54:26.876 --> 00:54:30.403
We all go to Amsterdam and
Jamie's the one who hooks up.

937
00:54:31.384 --> 00:54:33.153
For shame.

938
00:54:42.042 --> 00:54:43.516
Oh, that's me.

939
00:54:47.445 --> 00:54:48.961
Coop here. Sorry.

940
00:54:49.371 --> 00:54:51.688
Hello, Mr. Walters.

941
00:54:53.766 --> 00:54:55.791
What do you mean, you never
got the Gutterman file?

942
00:54:55.819 --> 00:54:57.760
I told, uh, Humphrey
to give it to you.

943
00:54:57.885 --> 00:55:01.440
That's hogwash. I, I handed it
to him myself yesterday.

944
00:55:02.065 --> 00:55:05.299
Yes, sir, I will tell Humphrey to
report to your office immediately.

945
00:55:05.362 --> 00:55:06.588
Bye.

946
00:55:08.682 --> 00:55:10.205
This job's killing me.

947
00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:23.468
Uh.

948
00:55:23.523 --> 00:55:25.125
Uh, let me handle this.

949
00:55:25.165 --> 00:55:26.984
I speak bad German.

950
00:55:30.156 --> 00:55:31.781
- Mm?
- Mm.

951
00:55:32.882 --> 00:55:34.171
Um...

952
00:55:51.141 --> 00:55:53.409
- What did he say?
- He said he's driving.

953
00:55:53.434 --> 00:55:54.682
- Oh.
- Something.

954
00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:56.096
Yeah.

955
00:55:56.776 --> 00:55:57.800
Uh...

956
00:56:00.089 --> 00:56:01.354
Berlin?

957
00:56:10.075 --> 00:56:11.715
- Berlin.
- Berlin?

958
00:56:11.770 --> 00:56:12.856
Berlin.

959
00:56:18.589 --> 00:56:20.606
- He's going to Berlin.
- Awesome.

960
00:56:22.614 --> 00:56:24.270
- You guys, to Berlin.
- Oh, thank you.

961
00:56:24.309 --> 00:56:26.262
- Berlin.
- Come on, let's go.

962
00:56:34.397 --> 00:56:36.373
Next stop, Berlin.

963
00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:00.193
Beautiful.

964
00:57:00.478 --> 00:57:01.978
We made it to Berlin.

965
00:57:02.052 --> 00:57:03.170
Yeah.

966
00:57:03.365 --> 00:57:04.928
Berlin.

967
00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:10.989
- Bratislava?
- Yeah.

968
00:57:11.262 --> 00:57:12.787
Bratislava.

969
00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:21.333
Dear sweet mother of God.

970
00:57:21.632 --> 00:57:24.028
We're in Eastern Europe.

971
00:57:26.529 --> 00:57:27.993
Ew.

972
00:57:44.212 --> 00:57:45.646
Excuse me.

973
00:57:46.107 --> 00:57:48.232
Do you speak any English?

974
00:57:49.053 --> 00:57:50.943
You are Americans?

975
00:57:51.076 --> 00:57:52.318
Yeah.

976
00:57:52.887 --> 00:57:54.646
I love America.

977
00:57:55.412 --> 00:57:58.943
We just get Miami Vice on television.

978
00:57:59.006 --> 00:58:02.506
Hey, man, Miami Vice is
 number one new show.

979
00:58:02.779 --> 00:58:03.803
Yeah.

980
00:58:03.842 --> 00:58:06.748
Um, listen, we're uh,
we're trying to get to Berlin...

981
00:58:06.771 --> 00:58:09.584
Germany. Do you know if there's
a train coming anytime soon?

982
00:58:09.654 --> 00:58:11.334
Oh, yes, very soon.

983
00:58:11.389 --> 00:58:13.209
They are building it now.

984
00:58:16.941 --> 00:58:18.915
Stop. Hammer time.

985
00:58:20.138 --> 00:58:21.844
Enjoy Bratislava.

986
00:58:21.954 --> 00:58:24.243
It's good, uh,
you came in summer.

987
00:58:24.332 --> 00:58:27.626
In winter, it can get very depressing.

988
00:58:28.790 --> 00:58:30.782
Okay, we gotta figure something out.

989
00:58:30.837 --> 00:58:32.719
How much money do we have?

990
00:58:37.397 --> 00:58:39.155
<i>Frommer's travel tip.</i>

991
00:58:40.478 --> 00:58:42.061
I don't have anything.

992
00:58:42.312 --> 00:58:44.233
What? I got noth--
Fine.

993
00:58:51.196 --> 00:58:53.664
A dollar and 83 cents American.

994
00:58:54.094 --> 00:58:55.453
What are we gonna get with that?

995
00:59:01.481 --> 00:59:04.680
Gotta love that exchange rate.

996
00:59:06.157 --> 00:59:07.352
Fine.

997
00:59:10.863 --> 00:59:12.436
Dinner is served.

998
00:59:12.578 --> 00:59:15.022
Would the masters care for anything else?

999
00:59:15.140 --> 00:59:16.249
Think we're good.

1000
00:59:16.319 --> 00:59:17.538
Thanks.

1001
00:59:18.350 --> 00:59:19.366
Oh.

1002
00:59:19.452 --> 00:59:21.030
A nickel.

1003
00:59:23.017 --> 00:59:24.562
You see this?

1004
00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:26.978
I quit.

1005
00:59:28.245 --> 00:59:31.431
I open my own hotel.

1006
00:59:39.199 --> 00:59:41.656
So, we got 27 cents left.

1007
00:59:41.812 --> 00:59:43.687
What is there to do in this town?

1008
00:59:45.952 --> 00:59:47.827
Woo hoo!

1009
01:00:02.634 --> 01:00:03.704
Hey.

1010
01:00:03.775 --> 01:00:05.501
This song sounds familiar.

1011
01:00:08.089 --> 01:00:10.142
Jenny, let me check your coat.

1012
01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:17.311
Hey.

1013
01:00:17.374 --> 01:00:19.866
Jenny.
That outfit is horrible.

1014
01:00:19.897 --> 01:00:21.780
Just take it off. Now!

1015
01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:26.642
No, but I will let you buy me a drink.

1016
01:00:26.892 --> 01:00:28.376
Excuse me.

1017
01:00:30.009 --> 01:00:32.384
You are the woman from the Paris
train station, aren't you?

1018
01:00:32.681 --> 01:00:34.306
- My name is--
- Christoph.

1019
01:00:34.774 --> 01:00:35.876
Yes.

1020
01:00:35.923 --> 01:00:37.274
What are you doing here?

1021
01:00:37.319 --> 01:00:38.845
Well, this is my place.

1022
01:00:38.955 --> 01:00:41.275
My family owns many
night clubs throughout Europe.

1023
01:00:41.334 --> 01:00:44.517
I'd be honored if you'd join me
in my VIP room for a drink.

1024
01:00:44.715 --> 01:00:46.133
Okay.

1025
01:00:48.416 --> 01:00:50.051
Bye, Cooper.

1026
01:00:56.863 --> 01:00:58.107
What's that?

1027
01:00:58.178 --> 01:00:59.569
It's Absinthe.

1028
01:00:59.607 --> 01:01:01.381
Frommer's says
it's illegal in the States...

1029
01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:03.828
because it makes you
hallucinate and go crazy.

1030
01:01:03.971 --> 01:01:06.482
They call it "The Green Fairy."

1031
01:01:13.204 --> 01:01:15.532
My family has a yacht in the Aegean.

1032
01:01:15.915 --> 01:01:17.517
Come with me, Jennifer.

1033
01:01:17.564 --> 01:01:19.611
We will sail away together.

1034
01:01:19.923 --> 01:01:21.157
Oh, my God.

1035
01:01:21.196 --> 01:01:24.861
We will swim with dolphins
and sip champagne by moonlight.

1036
01:01:25.187 --> 01:01:26.736
Oh, my God.

1037
01:01:26.798 --> 01:01:30.400
We'll spend the day sunbathing,
drinking wine.

1038
01:01:30.861 --> 01:01:33.103
My wife makes the best sangria.

1039
01:01:33.253 --> 01:01:34.689
Wait. What?

1040
01:01:34.791 --> 01:01:36.188
Sangria.

1041
01:01:36.446 --> 01:01:40.454
Well, you take a good Spanish rioja,
you put in slices of orange, and--

1042
01:01:40.483 --> 01:01:41.633
No, no, no. Wait.

1043
01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:43.805
You said you were married?

1044
01:01:44.383 --> 01:01:48.102
So, you just go around Europe,
sleeping with every woman you meet?

1045
01:01:48.161 --> 01:01:50.625
No, please, Jennifer.
It is not like that.

1046
01:01:50.766 --> 01:01:52.930
I also sleep with men.

1047
01:01:56.701 --> 01:01:59.148
I gotta say, I'm not feeling anything.

1048
01:01:59.429 --> 01:02:00.843
Me neither.

1049
01:02:01.010 --> 01:02:02.937
Sober as a judge.

1050
01:02:04.315 --> 01:02:05.483
How about you?

1051
01:02:05.531 --> 01:02:07.703
I'm not feeling a goddamn thing.

1052
01:02:07.767 --> 01:02:09.836
This Absinthe is bullshit.

1053
01:02:09.882 --> 01:02:11.685
I hear you, my brother.

1054
01:02:11.915 --> 01:02:13.375
I'm out of here.

1055
01:02:14.053 --> 01:02:15.437
Excuse me.

1056
01:02:15.608 --> 01:02:18.993
- Hey, so where's Christoph?
- Shut up.

1057
01:02:38.865 --> 01:02:40.362
Woo! Woo woo!

1058
01:02:40.387 --> 01:02:41.908
- Europe.
- Europe.

1059
01:02:41.933 --> 01:02:44.458
- Woo.
- Europe.

1060
01:02:46.148 --> 01:02:47.828
So tomorrow, Berlin.

1061
01:02:47.989 --> 01:02:49.788
Tomorrow, Mieke.

1062
01:02:56.621 --> 01:02:58.144
Check it out.

1063
01:02:58.535 --> 01:02:59.996
No way.

1064
01:03:00.065 --> 01:03:03.722
Jamie's hooking up with another girl?
Goddamn it.

1065
01:03:04.292 --> 01:03:05.535
It's just so unfair.

1066
01:03:05.566 --> 01:03:07.895
I've been all over the place,
looking for crazy European sex,

1067
01:03:07.933 --> 01:03:10.011
and he's the one who ends up get--

1068
01:03:10.292 --> 01:03:12.503
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

1069
01:03:16.346 --> 01:03:19.159
That is some pretty fucked-up shit.

1070
01:03:31.776 --> 01:03:35.229
They really are the worst twins ever.

1071
01:04:02.433 --> 01:04:05.301
That was a pretty wild night, eh?

1072
01:04:05.936 --> 01:04:08.856
Yep. Pretty wild, pretty wild.

1073
01:04:11.144 --> 01:04:13.136
I know I was out of control.

1074
01:04:13.254 --> 01:04:14.793
How about you guys?
Did you, uh--?

1075
01:04:14.823 --> 01:04:16.058
All right, look.

1076
01:04:16.144 --> 01:04:17.731
We were really drunk,

1077
01:04:17.816 --> 01:04:20.761
things got a little crazy,
and Jamie...

1078
01:04:20.993 --> 01:04:22.496
kissed me.

1079
01:04:23.191 --> 01:04:24.968
Let's just forget about it, okay?

1080
01:04:25.025 --> 01:04:27.824
Okay, fine.
Um, I'll give it a rest.

1081
01:04:28.270 --> 01:04:29.551
Huh!

1082
01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:31.980
Jamie, can I borrow your Frommer's?

1083
01:04:37.245 --> 01:04:39.089
Oh, here it is, Bratislava.

1084
01:04:39.167 --> 01:04:41.651
Hm. Capital of Slovakia.

1085
01:04:41.765 --> 01:04:44.143
Oh, here's a fun fact.

1086
01:04:44.604 --> 01:04:47.112
You made out with your sister, man.

1087
01:04:47.151 --> 01:04:50.411
- Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.
- Like two dogs in heat. Everyone--

1088
01:04:53.870 --> 01:04:56.572
My friends, where is the beef?

1089
01:04:58.177 --> 01:04:59.877
You go to Berlin?

1090
01:05:00.224 --> 01:05:01.604
I'm your ride.

1091
01:05:01.676 --> 01:05:03.174
Hop in.

1092
01:05:29.454 --> 01:05:30.615
Hey.

1093
01:05:30.661 --> 01:05:32.708
This is Mieke's apartment building.

1094
01:05:32.914 --> 01:05:35.068
Wish me all sorts of luck, guys.

1095
01:05:36.146 --> 01:05:38.193
You'll do great, Scotty.

1096
01:05:40.309 --> 01:05:41.861
Thanks.

1097
01:06:01.605 --> 01:06:04.417
I came all this way.
I'm not gonna miss this.

1098
01:06:11.234 --> 01:06:14.220
- Dude, Mieke's hideous. Run.
- Stop.

1099
01:06:26.078 --> 01:06:27.969
Hi, uh, my name is Scott Thomas.

1100
01:06:28.008 --> 01:06:30.430
I'm from America and
I'm here to see Mieke.

1101
01:06:30.516 --> 01:06:32.789
I'm sorry, but Mieke's not here.

1102
01:06:32.925 --> 01:06:34.289
Do you know where she is?

1103
01:06:34.345 --> 01:06:36.461
She's gone for the summer.

1104
01:06:50.966 --> 01:06:54.028
My daughter had intended
to spend the summer in America,

1105
01:06:54.068 --> 01:06:56.427
looking at colleges
and visiting some friends.

1106
01:06:56.472 --> 01:06:59.552
But, uh, several days ago,
she suddenly changed her mind.

1107
01:06:59.591 --> 01:07:01.602
She would not tell me why.

1108
01:07:01.839 --> 01:07:03.966
I think I know why.

1109
01:07:09.461 --> 01:07:12.714
Uh, this is Heinrich.
He's Mieke's stepbrother.

1110
01:07:12.855 --> 01:07:16.003
As I was saying,
she packed up her bag and left.

1111
01:07:16.034 --> 01:07:17.394
It was all very sudden.

1112
01:07:17.435 --> 01:07:19.582
But, do you know where
Mieke is right now?

1113
01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:22.292
As you know, she's always been
very interested in the classics...

1114
01:07:22.331 --> 01:07:24.808
Greek and Roman literature and history.

1115
01:07:24.855 --> 01:07:26.387
And she's always enjoyed the ocean.

1116
01:07:26.417 --> 01:07:29.588
So, she found a program
that combines all her interests.

1117
01:07:29.644 --> 01:07:31.005
Well, do you know where she is?

1118
01:07:31.044 --> 01:07:32.224
Mm.

1119
01:07:32.278 --> 01:07:36.294
Uh, she enrolled in a summer-at-sea
program, based in Rome.

1120
01:07:37.304 --> 01:07:38.692
Rome.

1121
01:07:39.225 --> 01:07:41.489
Okay, then I guess
we'll go to Rome, then.

1122
01:07:41.528 --> 01:07:44.653
Well, unfortunately,
Mieke's only in Rome for orientation.

1123
01:07:44.692 --> 01:07:47.440
Tomorrow her group boards a boat
and she'll be gone for the summer.

1124
01:07:47.482 --> 01:07:49.005
And, she'll be, uh,

1125
01:07:49.084 --> 01:07:51.153
quite unreachable.

1126
01:07:51.754 --> 01:07:53.497
Unreachable.

1127
01:08:00.719 --> 01:08:03.094
Mieke's tour group goes
to the Vatican tomorrow,

1128
01:08:03.125 --> 01:08:05.422
then she gets on that boat and she's gone.

1129
01:08:05.488 --> 01:08:07.125
So, it's over?

1130
01:08:09.096 --> 01:08:10.682
Uh, hey.

1131
01:08:10.745 --> 01:08:13.549
Thanks for sticking with me
through all this, guys, but...

1132
01:08:13.710 --> 01:08:15.588
you should probably call your parents,

1133
01:08:15.659 --> 01:08:18.182
have them wire you
some money and go home.

1134
01:08:18.811 --> 01:08:21.002
And what are you gonna do?

1135
01:08:21.557 --> 01:08:23.432
I'm going to Rome.

1136
01:08:24.393 --> 01:08:26.346
I'll Walk, I'll hitchhike,

1137
01:08:26.479 --> 01:08:29.471
I'll swim if I have to, but
I'm gonna get to Mieke somehow.

1138
01:08:34.378 --> 01:08:35.779
Maybe, that'll help.

1139
01:08:35.890 --> 01:08:37.607
Where'd you get all that?

1140
01:08:37.681 --> 01:08:38.739
Wait.

1141
01:08:38.794 --> 01:08:40.552
Where's your Leica?

1142
01:08:41.063 --> 01:08:42.177
Sold it.

1143
01:08:42.248 --> 01:08:43.779
What?

1144
01:08:45.161 --> 01:08:46.638
You sold your Leica?

1145
01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:47.786
But, you loved that thing.

1146
01:08:47.825 --> 01:08:49.505
What about your photo tour of Europe?

1147
01:08:49.537 --> 01:08:50.910
What about the chateaus?

1148
01:08:50.958 --> 01:08:53.357
Chateaus have been there for 300 years.

1149
01:08:53.466 --> 01:08:55.849
Mieke's gone in 12 hours.

1150
01:08:58.678 --> 01:08:59.943
Come on, let's go.
Frommer's says...

1151
01:08:59.968 --> 01:09:02.906
you're supposed to check in 3 hours
before any international flight.

1152
01:09:02.968 --> 01:09:04.288
Come here, Guidebook.

1153
01:09:04.335 --> 01:09:05.639
Oh! Woo!

1154
01:09:05.686 --> 01:09:08.428
We're going to Rome.
We're going to Rome!

1155
01:09:40.174 --> 01:09:42.036
All right, Summer at Sea group.

1156
01:09:42.091 --> 01:09:44.513
Our tour begins in the Vatican Museum.

1157
01:09:44.599 --> 01:09:46.223
This way, please.

1158
01:09:53.909 --> 01:09:55.639
There it is.

1159
01:10:01.663 --> 01:10:05.530
This entrance is for
private tour groups only.

1160
01:10:07.006 --> 01:10:09.811
Oh. But, we are a private tour group.

1161
01:10:09.888 --> 01:10:12.391
We've come all the way from America.

1162
01:10:14.695 --> 01:10:17.864
That guy in the orange jacket
is mentally retarded.

1163
01:10:22.326 --> 01:10:24.289
Si, I can tell.

1164
01:10:24.524 --> 01:10:26.954
How very, very sad!

1165
01:10:27.469 --> 01:10:29.047
Yes, it is.

1166
01:10:29.344 --> 01:10:31.633
But if you are a tour,
where is your guide?

1167
01:10:31.703 --> 01:10:33.836
We've got a fantastic tour guide.

1168
01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:35.071
Right here.

1169
01:10:35.134 --> 01:10:36.961
What? No.

1170
01:10:39.999 --> 01:10:43.307
The Vatican has been used
as a papal residence ever since...

1171
01:10:43.338 --> 01:10:47.174
the time of Emperor Constantine,
the Great of the 5th century A.D.

1172
01:10:49.659 --> 01:10:50.721
Oh.

1173
01:10:50.761 --> 01:10:52.292
Okay. Um...

1174
01:10:52.331 --> 01:10:53.901
if you'll all follow me, please.

1175
01:10:53.947 --> 01:10:55.237
Ahem.

1176
01:10:58.317 --> 01:11:01.270
Have a very special day...

1177
01:11:01.332 --> 01:11:04.970
for a very special little man.

1178
01:11:05.465 --> 01:11:07.027
Okay.

1179
01:11:09.232 --> 01:11:11.691
I can't believe that guy let us in.

1180
01:11:11.781 --> 01:11:12.957
What a retard!

1181
01:11:12.992 --> 01:11:16.008
- Okay, let's go find Mieke.
- Scusate. (Sorry.)

1182
01:11:16.313 --> 01:11:19.469
One of our English-speaking
tour guides has called in sick.

1183
01:11:19.727 --> 01:11:22.242
Could you please take
these peoples also?

1184
01:11:25.032 --> 01:11:26.887
How big is Vatican City?

1185
01:11:26.926 --> 01:11:28.762
Point-five square kilometers.

1186
01:11:28.816 --> 01:11:30.309
Who built the colonnade?

1187
01:11:30.364 --> 01:11:32.997
Gianlorenzo Bernini, 1656.

1188
01:11:33.027 --> 01:11:34.426
Uh, where are the bathrooms?

1189
01:11:34.457 --> 01:11:35.894
Floors 2, 6 and 7.

1190
01:11:35.965 --> 01:11:39.269
Next I'll take you to where the College
of Cardinals elects a new pope.

1191
01:11:39.295 --> 01:11:42.170
When this happens, white smoke
is sent up from the Vatican.

1192
01:11:42.195 --> 01:11:43.022
And here's a fun fact--

1193
01:11:43.053 --> 01:11:45.344
Mieke's gotta be around here somewhere.

1194
01:11:45.936 --> 01:11:47.118
Let's go.

1195
01:11:55.766 --> 01:11:58.641
Behind me is the appartamento papale...

1196
01:11:58.665 --> 01:12:00.243
or "papal apartment."

1197
01:12:00.274 --> 01:12:02.298
We're obviously not permitted in there.

1198
01:12:02.923 --> 01:12:05.063
Excuse me, miss.
What is this?

1199
01:12:05.131 --> 01:12:07.610
Oh. That is the Bell of San Marco.

1200
01:12:07.688 --> 01:12:08.907
When the pope dies,

1201
01:12:08.932 --> 01:12:12.788
the cardinal vicar of Rome rings this Bell
to notify the people of Rome.

1202
01:12:12.837 --> 01:12:14.798
Next, we will view the Sistine Chapel.

1203
01:12:14.853 --> 01:12:16.438
Follow me, please.

1204
01:12:19.891 --> 01:12:21.016
Come on.

1205
01:12:21.072 --> 01:12:22.290
I think I heard them.

1206
01:12:22.329 --> 01:12:23.495
Which way did they go?

1207
01:12:23.526 --> 01:12:25.829
That way.
I'd stake my reputation on it.

1208
01:12:25.876 --> 01:12:27.386
Good enough for me.

1209
01:12:27.521 --> 01:12:29.135
Hey, check it out.

1210
01:12:30.084 --> 01:12:31.838
I wonder what this does.

1211
01:12:31.904 --> 01:12:33.604
It doesn't do anything.
It's a rope.

1212
01:12:33.643 --> 01:12:35.096
Come on, let's go.

1213
01:12:35.230 --> 01:12:37.331
They got a lot of old stuff here.

1214
01:12:44.899 --> 01:12:46.321
Dio mio!
(My God!)

1215
01:12:46.905 --> 01:12:49.094
The Bell of San Marco.

1216
01:12:50.869 --> 01:12:52.895
The pope is dead.

1217
01:12:56.823 --> 01:12:58.239
Whoa.

1218
01:13:00.629 --> 01:13:02.506
She's not in here.

1219
01:13:02.919 --> 01:13:05.049
Let's go. We're definitely
not supposed to be in here.

1220
01:13:05.074 --> 01:13:07.255
Hey, check this out.

1221
01:13:07.860 --> 01:13:09.096
I'm the pope.

1222
01:13:09.151 --> 01:13:10.362
Cooper.

1223
01:13:10.510 --> 01:13:12.674
Take off the pope hat.

1224
01:13:12.736 --> 01:13:14.557
Oh, no. It's okay.
I'm Catholic.

1225
01:13:14.596 --> 01:13:16.830
Cooper, take it off!
Goddamn it.

1226
01:13:17.682 --> 01:13:20.025
Oh, you took the Lord's name in vain.

1227
01:13:20.057 --> 01:13:22.479
Only I can forgive you now, my son.

1228
01:13:22.510 --> 01:13:24.224
Take that fudging thing off.
Cooper!

1229
01:13:24.249 --> 01:13:26.347
- The pope breaks an open-field tackle.
- Cooper.

1230
01:13:26.372 --> 01:13:27.606
- Coop, come here.
- It's a Hail Mary.

1231
01:13:27.646 --> 01:13:29.115
- He catches at the 40...
- Please.

1232
01:13:29.140 --> 01:13:31.508
the 30, the 20, the 10,

1233
01:13:31.556 --> 01:13:34.153
Touchdown, pope!

1234
01:13:34.645 --> 01:13:36.599
The pope makes a two-point conversion.

1235
01:13:36.638 --> 01:13:38.872
And oh, my lord!

1236
01:13:38.919 --> 01:13:43.583
It's the pope, eight,
and the heathens, nothing!

1237
01:13:44.411 --> 01:13:46.880
How's you, sucker?

1238
01:13:49.176 --> 01:13:50.537
Cooper, the hat.

1239
01:13:50.608 --> 01:13:53.920
- The hat, the hat is on fire.
- ♪ No, we don't need no water ♪

1240
01:13:53.959 --> 01:13:56.412
- ♪ Let the mother-- ♪
- I'm not kidding. Look.

1241
01:13:57.228 --> 01:13:58.811
Oh, holy shit.

1242
01:13:59.092 --> 01:14:01.319
- Ooh!
- I don't want this.

1243
01:14:01.561 --> 01:14:03.475
The fireplace.
Fireplace. Go, go.

1244
01:14:05.222 --> 01:14:06.613
Whoa!

1245
01:14:14.590 --> 01:14:16.036
White smoke.

1246
01:14:16.332 --> 01:14:19.623
They've elected the new pope!

1247
01:14:22.090 --> 01:14:24.269
I'm coming to you live
from Vatican Square...

1248
01:14:24.308 --> 01:14:26.980
where the College of Cardinals,
in a surprise move...

1249
01:14:27.051 --> 01:14:29.207
<i>has just elected a new pope.</i>

1250
01:14:29.301 --> 01:14:31.847
<i>The crowd is very, very excited.</i>

1251
01:14:31.886 --> 01:14:33.738
This is so strange.

1252
01:14:33.808 --> 01:14:37.182
Usually, they wait 15 days
to elect a new pope.

1253
01:14:37.363 --> 01:14:39.488
We could be seeing history in the making.

1254
01:14:39.624 --> 01:14:42.137
We could be seeing an arrest in the making.

1255
01:14:50.058 --> 01:14:51.276
There she is.

1256
01:14:51.573 --> 01:14:52.963
Mieke.

1257
01:14:55.056 --> 01:14:56.479
Hey. Stupid curtain.

1258
01:14:56.518 --> 01:14:57.550
Ah, ah.

1259
01:14:57.939 --> 01:14:59.299
Let me out.

1260
01:15:02.953 --> 01:15:04.438
Mieke!

1261
01:15:05.014 --> 01:15:07.188
It's the new pope!

1262
01:15:07.516 --> 01:15:10.665
Oh oh oh!

1263
01:15:33.806 --> 01:15:35.433
What the hell?

1264
01:15:41.102 --> 01:15:42.567
Mieke!

1265
01:15:45.067 --> 01:15:46.630
Hold on!

1266
01:15:52.669 --> 01:15:54.843
This is one crazy pope.

1267
01:16:04.229 --> 01:16:05.393
You!

1268
01:16:05.464 --> 01:16:06.949
Ferma. Stop.

1269
01:16:07.003 --> 01:16:08.151
You!

1270
01:16:10.065 --> 01:16:11.104
You...

1271
01:16:11.136 --> 01:16:13.792
and your retarded friend...

1272
01:16:14.097 --> 01:16:16.300
you're in big, big trouble.

1273
01:16:16.365 --> 01:16:17.565
Oi.

1274
01:16:20.621 --> 01:16:23.075
Take your mitts off them boys.

1275
01:16:23.245 --> 01:16:25.239
They're with me.

1276
01:16:27.137 --> 01:16:31.075
I've just about had enough
of you fucking Ities.

1277
01:16:31.536 --> 01:16:33.340
But, I am Swiss.

1278
01:16:33.950 --> 01:16:35.520
Them too.

1279
01:16:41.693 --> 01:16:42.748
Now, bud,

1280
01:16:42.787 --> 01:16:44.264
you get in there,

1281
01:16:44.326 --> 01:16:46.647
and you say what you got to say.

1282
01:16:47.828 --> 01:16:49.513
Mieke. I'm here.

1283
01:16:49.576 --> 01:16:50.920
I made it.

1284
01:16:54.052 --> 01:16:55.990
Who are you?

1285
01:16:56.129 --> 01:16:59.003
<i>Oh!</i>

1286
01:16:59.514 --> 01:17:01.378
What a fucking loser!

1287
01:17:01.425 --> 01:17:03.862
I'm gonna videotape this.

1288
01:17:04.512 --> 01:17:06.331
I'm, I'm Scott.

1289
01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:08.464
From Ohio?

1290
01:17:08.550 --> 01:17:10.105
Scott?

1291
01:17:10.573 --> 01:17:12.253
Scott Thomas?

1292
01:17:12.342 --> 01:17:13.698
Yes.

1293
01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:15.534
From Ohio?

1294
01:17:15.589 --> 01:17:17.386
Uh, what are you doing in Rome?

1295
01:17:17.425 --> 01:17:19.152
I came here to be with you.

1296
01:17:19.276 --> 01:17:21.697
Listen, I just traveled
all the way across Europe.

1297
01:17:21.729 --> 01:17:24.510
I, I got, I got chased by naked men.

1298
01:17:24.589 --> 01:17:28.222
I ate brownies with
absolutely no drugs in them.

1299
01:17:28.395 --> 01:17:31.511
I watched a brother and sister make out.

1300
01:17:32.071 --> 01:17:35.956
I, I kicked a robot in the balls,
but I did it all so that...

1301
01:17:36.267 --> 01:17:38.753
So, I could tell you one thing.

1302
01:17:41.098 --> 01:17:42.449
I love you, Mieke.

1303
01:17:42.504 --> 01:17:44.699
Aw!

1304
01:17:45.293 --> 01:17:48.574
We're perfect for each other.
What do you think?

1305
01:17:49.926 --> 01:17:51.668
I think...

1306
01:18:03.410 --> 01:18:04.527
Oh!

1307
01:18:04.565 --> 01:18:05.605
- Ah.
- Ah!

1308
01:18:05.630 --> 01:18:06.644
- Ah.
- Ah.

1309
01:18:06.683 --> 01:18:08.128
- Oh.
- Oh, Mike.

1310
01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:10.051
Mi-- Mieke.

1311
01:18:22.890 --> 01:18:25.336
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

1312
01:18:25.406 --> 01:18:27.375
I have cheated on my husband.

1313
01:18:27.414 --> 01:18:29.859
Do you think God will ever forgive me?

1314
01:18:29.905 --> 01:18:31.676
Oh, yes.

1315
01:18:32.742 --> 01:18:34.289
- Oh.
- Father?

1316
01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:35.703
Oh.

1317
01:18:36.570 --> 01:18:37.765
Father!

1318
01:18:37.805 --> 01:18:39.367
Oh! Ah!

1319
01:18:45.033 --> 01:18:46.728
This sucks.

1320
01:18:46.853 --> 01:18:50.150
I can't believe I'm the only one
who didn't hook up while we were here.

1321
01:18:50.236 --> 01:18:53.088
Europe is officially the
worst country on earth.

1322
01:18:53.494 --> 01:18:54.611
I know.

1323
01:18:54.666 --> 01:18:58.768
I thought I'd at least get to have
one crazy European sex.

1324
01:19:01.969 --> 01:19:03.470
What?

1325
01:19:11.954 --> 01:19:14.751
- Scott, I have to go.
- Okay.

1326
01:19:15.063 --> 01:19:17.295
My boat is leaving.

1327
01:19:17.975 --> 01:19:21.811
I still can't believe you came
all the way here, just for me.

1328
01:19:21.904 --> 01:19:23.311
What can I say?

1329
01:19:23.421 --> 01:19:25.397
I'm very unpredictable.

1330
01:19:26.063 --> 01:19:28.110
Keep writing to me, Scott, okay?

1331
01:19:28.165 --> 01:19:29.805
Yeah, I will.

1332
01:19:38.829 --> 01:19:40.610
- Go.
- Bye.

1333
01:19:48.604 --> 01:19:49.799
Yes.

1334
01:19:49.869 --> 01:19:52.174
Yes, yes. Woo-hoo!

1335
01:19:53.955 --> 01:19:55.041
Hey, guys.

1336
01:19:55.073 --> 01:19:57.471
I'm so glad we got
to take this trip together.

1337
01:19:57.631 --> 01:20:00.112
This is the best time of my life.

1338
01:20:03.546 --> 01:20:05.399
Excuse me.

1339
01:20:05.602 --> 01:20:09.360
You're the young man who gave me
that tour of the Vatican, aren't you?

1340
01:20:11.274 --> 01:20:14.269
- Listen, I'm very sorry.
- I just wanted to thank you.

1341
01:20:14.420 --> 01:20:16.688
You were the most knowledgeable, albeit...

1342
01:20:16.750 --> 01:20:20.063
idiosyncratic tour guide I've ever had.

1343
01:20:20.688 --> 01:20:21.899
Thanks.

1344
01:20:21.954 --> 01:20:23.907
But, I'm not actually a tour guide.

1345
01:20:23.992 --> 01:20:26.711
Um, I've just read Frommer's
enough to have it memorized.

1346
01:20:26.766 --> 01:20:29.750
Although, I threw in a few things
Frommer's didn't know about.

1347
01:20:29.860 --> 01:20:31.836
How would you like to add them?

1348
01:20:32.026 --> 01:20:33.438
Excuse me?

1349
01:20:33.516 --> 01:20:36.024
That's my guidebook.

1350
01:20:41.288 --> 01:20:43.335
I'm Arthur Frommer.

1351
01:20:45.202 --> 01:20:46.866
It's amazing.

1352
01:20:46.913 --> 01:20:51.603
Frommer's is gonna pay me to see
every museum and cathedral in Europe.

1353
01:20:52.657 --> 01:20:54.782
That sounds so exciting...

1354
01:20:54.882 --> 01:20:56.946
- for you.
- Hey.

1355
01:20:57.682 --> 01:20:59.523
I figured, since you're
gonna be staying...

1356
01:20:59.558 --> 01:21:01.493
you might need this.

1357
01:21:02.799 --> 01:21:04.848
- A disposable camera.
- That's right.

1358
01:21:04.945 --> 01:21:06.051
Thanks, Scotty.

1359
01:21:06.098 --> 01:21:07.950
That's from both of us.

1366
01:21:18.363 --> 01:21:19.777
I see.

1367
01:21:19.891 --> 01:21:22.207
Fired? Well, I...

1368

1369
01:21:24.637 --> 01:21:26.371
I understand. I just...

1370
01:21:26.746 --> 01:21:28.441
Goodbye, sir.

1371
01:21:29.098 --> 01:21:30.769
They had to catch you eventually, right?

1372
01:21:30.816 --> 01:21:32.746
- No, they fired Humphrey.
- Shut up.

1373
01:21:32.793 --> 01:21:34.473
Yeah, I got his office and a raise.

1374
01:21:34.511 --> 01:21:35.798
No.

01:21:40.988 --> 01:21:43.105
- Have a good flight, everybody.
- Come here.

1378
01:21:46.258 --> 01:21:47.780

- Be good.

Thanks.

1382
01:22:28.461 --> 01:22:30.508
I'm on it.

01:22:36.591 --> 01:22:38.060
Whoa!

1384
01:22:39.825 --> 01:22:42.302

<i>My roommate hasn't

Do they room all you
pre-med geeks together?

1394
01:23:17.891 --> 01:23:19.724
I'm not sure I'm going pre-med.

majoring in German.

<i>German?
I've got a better idea.</i>

1399

Jenny, Jenny who?

1400
01:23:30.107 --> 01:23:32.529

Come here, robot.

1408
01:23:50.348 --> 01:23:52.832
Cooper, not again.

1409
01:23:52.949 --> 01:23:55.902

<i>What's the freak look like?</i>

01:24:05.692 --> 01:24:07.450
Better not be cooler than me.

<i>Is he bigger than me?</i>

What are you doing here?

1415
01:24:12.955 --> 01:24:14.715
Going to college.

1416
01:24:15.403 --> 01:24:17.778
You're going to college here?

1417
01:24:18.828 --> 01:24:20.661
- What dorm?
- This one.

How is this possible?

1420
01:24:28.785 --> 01:24:31.386
I guess they thought I was a guy.

1421
01:24:31.738 --> 01:24:35.316
Now, who would be dumb enough
to make a mistake like that?

Hello.

1437
01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:40.055
And welcome to Amsterdam's finest
and most luxurious youth hostel.

1438
01:25:40.110 --> 01:25:42.297
- Sounds great.
- Hey, there is no bathroom,

1439
01:25:42.329 --> 01:25:44.010
nor is there one nearby.

1440
01:25:54.785 --> 01:25:56.535
- Get it?
- She got it.

1441
01:25:56.590 --> 01:26:00.012
If you do not wish to have
your valuables stolen,

1442
01:26:00.073 --> 01:26:03.785
I suggest destroying them
or discarding them right now.

1443
01:26:03.863 --> 01:26:07.535
You can also try
hiding your valuables...

1444
01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:09.082
in your anus.

1445
01:26:15.910 --> 01:26:18.810
I'm gonna rip away his pants
and look at his dick, okay? Okay.

1446
01:26:18.896 --> 01:26:20.943
Ready?
Quit. Shut up.

1447
01:26:20.998 --> 01:26:23.533
Sorry. I know I fucked it up.
I fucked it up.

1448
01:26:23.646 --> 01:26:25.552
Yes, you take her hair,

1449
01:26:25.599 --> 01:26:27.841
and one strand at a time,

1450
01:26:27.935 --> 01:26:29.419
pull it out.

1451
01:26:29.552 --> 01:26:32.325
Use her like a humping post.

01:26:32.689 --> 01:26:34.224

1453
01:26:34.262 --> 01:26:37.442

1455
01:26:41.528 --> 01:26:44.197

they haven't seen before.
