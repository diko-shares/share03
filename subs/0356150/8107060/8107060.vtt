<i>Congratulations, Hudson
High class of 2004.</i>

3
00:03:05.746 --> 00:03:06.873
There she is. Fiona!

4
00:03:09.166 --> 00:03:10.251
Bye.

5
00:03:10.418 --> 00:03:12.128
- Hey.
- Hey.

6
00:03:12.295 --> 00:03:13.796
- Ha, ha.
- Hey, you.

7
00:03:15.923 --> 00:03:16.966
Mm.

8
00:03:17.133 --> 00:03:20.219
- Congratulations, graduate.
- Thanks, baby.

9
00:03:20.386 --> 00:03:22.138
And congratulations
to you, Cooper.

10
00:03:22.305 --> 00:03:24.015
Aw. Thanks, baby.

11
00:03:25.016 --> 00:03:26.058
Nice try.

12
00:03:26.225 --> 00:03:28.060
All right. See you at
Wade's party tonight?

13
00:03:28.227 --> 00:03:30.062
- See you then.
- All right.

14
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.025
So it's just you and me
for the entire summer.

15
00:03:34.358 --> 00:03:36.485
Next year you graduate,
join me at college.

16
00:03:36.652 --> 00:03:37.695
See? Just like we planned.

17
00:03:38.237 --> 00:03:41.240
- Scott, we need to talk.
- Yeah? About what?

18
00:03:42.074 --> 00:03:43.576
About me dumping you.

19
00:03:44.076 --> 00:03:45.119
Huh?

20
00:03:45.286 --> 00:03:50.041
There he is. The graduate and his
beautiful girlfriend. Huh? Okay?

21
00:03:50.583 --> 00:03:52.793
Smile, you two.

22
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.631
- Action.
- Dad, Morn, Grandma...

23
00:03:56.797 --> 00:03:58.007
...Uncle Moke, uh...

24
00:03:58.174 --> 00:04:00.509
...I'm gonna need a
minute here, okay?

25
00:04:00.885 --> 00:04:02.325
What do you mean,
you're dumping me?

26
00:04:02.762 --> 00:04:06.474
Scott, I just can't take all the lying
and cheating on each other anymore.

27
00:04:06.641 --> 00:04:09.393
What are you talking about?
Sweetie, I never cheated on you.

28
00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.479
I know. That's what
makes this so hard.

29
00:04:11.812 --> 00:04:13.356
You're looking good, you guys.

30
00:04:14.106 --> 00:04:16.233
Scotty, it's not you.

31
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.818
It's me.

32
00:04:19.195 --> 00:04:22.198
There I go, lying again.
No, it was you.

33
00:04:22.365 --> 00:04:24.325
You're just so...

34
00:04:25.117 --> 00:04:26.661
...predictable. - Smile!

35
00:04:28.579 --> 00:04:29.622
So that's it.

36
00:04:29.997 --> 00:04:33.125
Here's your letter jacket back.
Goodbye.

37
00:04:34.418 --> 00:04:35.878
This isn't mine.

38
00:04:39.548 --> 00:04:43.344
She's a keeper, huh? Oh, wow.

39
00:04:43.511 --> 00:04:45.638
Oh, my God.

40
00:04:47.181 --> 00:04:48.975
Fiona!

41
00:04:55.731 --> 00:04:57.525
Let's see that again.

42
00:05:00.486 --> 00:05:02.029
<i>Fiona!</i>

43
00:05:02.196 --> 00:05:04.782
- This is just so brutal.
- Ha, ha.

44
00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:07.952
And yet I can't look away.
Bert, play it again. Come on.

45
00:05:09.704 --> 00:05:12.206
- Fiona!
- Bert, get out of here.

46
00:05:12.373 --> 00:05:14.500
Ha, ha. Okay. See you, Coop.

47
00:05:14.667 --> 00:05:17.294
All right. Stay black, Bert.

48
00:05:17.461 --> 00:05:20.339
Ha, ha. "Fiona!"

49
00:05:20.506 --> 00:05:22.758
<i>Mail,</i> motherfucker!

50
00:05:22.925 --> 00:05:24.176
Hey, I got one from Mieke.

51
00:05:27.722 --> 00:05:29.515
<i>"Happy herzlichen."</i>

52
00:05:29.682 --> 00:05:32.852
You still writing that guy? I thought
that was just for German class.

53
00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:36.522
Uh, yeah, it was at first, but we're
actually becoming good friends.

54
00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:38.149
He's a really cool guy.

55
00:05:38.315 --> 00:05:43.654
"Dear Mieke, greetings from
your American pen pal."

56
00:05:43.821 --> 00:05:45.573
Scotty, Girl Scouts
have pen pals.

57
00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:48.617
Listen to yourself, all right?

58
00:05:48.784 --> 00:05:52.079
You met a "cool guy"
on the "Internet."

59
00:05:52.246 --> 00:05:54.999
This is how these sexual predators work.
Next thing you know...

60
00:05:55.166 --> 00:05:57.043
...he's gonna want to
"arrange a meeting"...

61
00:05:57.209 --> 00:06:00.004
...uh, where he will gas you, stuff
you in the back of his van...

62
00:06:00.171 --> 00:06:01.972
...and make a wind chime
out of your genitals.

63
00:06:02.131 --> 00:06:04.300
- Ha, ha.
- Come on, let's go to Wade's.

64
00:06:04.467 --> 00:06:07.136
All right. Screw it. Let's go.

65
00:06:07.303 --> 00:06:09.889
I'm not gonna let Fiona
ruin my graduation night.

66
00:06:10.056 --> 00:06:11.766
<i>Auf wiedersehen, Mieke.</i>

67
00:06:26.072 --> 00:06:28.407
- Heh. What's up, losers?
- What's up, Jenny?

68
00:06:28.574 --> 00:06:29.784
What's up, dude?

69
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:33.788
- Sorry to hear about Fiona. She's a whore.
- That's very sweet of you. Thanks.

70
00:06:33.954 --> 00:06:37.374
Enough Fiona talk. Look around.
There's gotta be 100 drunk girls.

71
00:06:37.541 --> 00:06:39.501
We should try to have sex
with every one of them.

72
00:06:39.627 --> 00:06:41.754
Hello? Mixed company?

73
00:06:41.921 --> 00:06:43.130
What?

74
00:06:43.297 --> 00:06:45.216
- I'm a girl.
- No, you're not.

75
00:06:45.382 --> 00:06:48.928
- You're just a cool guy with long hair.
- So where's your evil twin brother at?

76
00:06:49.178 --> 00:06:50.888
Jenny!

77
00:06:51.055 --> 00:06:52.431
Oh. There he is.

78
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:55.935
Hey, Jamie. In fine form, I see.

79
00:06:56.102 --> 00:06:59.271
Mm. Why'd you get
me gin and tonic?

80
00:06:59.438 --> 00:07:01.899
- I hate gin.
- You do?

81
00:07:02.066 --> 00:07:04.777
You guys are the
worst twins ever.

82
00:07:07.071 --> 00:07:08.614
<i>"ALL". Chug! Chug! Chug!</i>

83
00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:14.620
- When are you guys taking off?
- Tomorrow morning.

84
00:07:14.787 --> 00:07:17.957
Hey, Wade. Great party, bud.

85
00:07:19.375 --> 00:07:21.168
Man, I am so excited.

86
00:07:21.335 --> 00:07:23.879
A whole summer, backpacking
around Europe.

87
00:07:24.046 --> 00:07:27.675
You should've come with us instead
of working for Dr. Dad, Scotty!

88
00:07:27.842 --> 00:07:30.302
Oh! It's gonna be so awesome.

89
00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:35.307
Yeah. I planned every detail of
the trip to maximize the fun.

90
00:07:35.474 --> 00:07:37.434
You brought a
guidebook to a party?

91
00:07:37.601 --> 00:07:40.563
- Do you wanna see my itinerary?
- Do you wanna see my balls?

92
00:07:42.773 --> 00:07:44.471
You guys decide where
you're gonna go first?

93
00:07:44.484 --> 00:07:46.193
Paris! I can't wait.

94
00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.100
I heard two years ago,
Nicky Jager's sister,

95
00:07:48.113 --> 00:07:49.864
Debbie, met a wealthy
French guy...

96
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:52.741
...and spent a month sailing the
Mediterranean on his yacht.

97
00:07:52.908 --> 00:07:55.786
Isn't that the most romantic
thing you've ever heard?

98
00:07:56.287 --> 00:07:58.581
Stuck on a boat with
a weird French guy?

99
00:08:00.249 --> 00:08:04.795
- That sounds a little gay.
- It's not gay. I'm a girl.

100
00:08:04.962 --> 00:08:06.589
- Kind of gay.
- A little gay.

101
00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:10.718
All right, I gotta piss
like a pregnant woman.

102
00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:14.555
Hey, listen up, everybody.

103
00:08:15.848 --> 00:08:18.058
Got a little special thing
I'd like to do tonight.

104
00:08:18.601 --> 00:08:23.439
Gonna play a little song for you
about the nastiest, freakiest...

105
00:08:23.606 --> 00:08:25.941
...little sex puppet I know...

106
00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:27.860
...Fiona.

107
00:08:34.241 --> 00:08:36.827
This one's for you, baby.
Happy anniversary.

108
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:45.920
<i>Scotty doesn't know
That Fiona and me.</i>

109
00:08:46.086 --> 00:08:48.505
<i>Do it in my van every Sunday.</i>

110
00:08:48.672 --> 00:08:51.425
<i>She tells him she's in
church But she doesn't go.</i>

111
00:08:51.592 --> 00:08:54.386
<i>Still, she's on her knees
And Scotty doesn't know.</i>

112
00:08:55.429 --> 00:08:58.599
<i>Oh, Scotty doesn't know.</i>

113
00:08:58.766 --> 00:09:01.518
<i>So don't tell Scotty
Scotty doesn't know.</i>

114
00:09:01.685 --> 00:09:02.853
<i>Scotty doesn't know</i>

115
00:09:03.646 --> 00:09:05.731
I hope we're just as
popular in college...

116
00:09:05.898 --> 00:09:07.191
...as we were in high school.

117
00:09:07.358 --> 00:09:08.901
- We Will be.
- I know.

118
00:09:10.361 --> 00:09:12.196
Who needs more Chablis?

119
00:09:13.447 --> 00:09:16.075
- Candy, wanna come with?
- No, I'll stay here.

120
00:09:16.242 --> 00:09:17.952
Hello, Candy.

121
00:09:22.164 --> 00:09:23.374
- "Whoops!
- Aah!"

122
00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:26.043
Ha, ha. Holy cow!

123
00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:28.545
Oh, this isn't where
I parked my car.

124
00:09:29.463 --> 00:09:32.758
<i>I can't believe
he's so trusting.</i>

125
00:09:35.219 --> 00:09:38.639
<i>While I'm right
behind you thrusting</i>

126
00:09:38.806 --> 00:09:41.308
<i>'Cause Scotty doesn't
know Scotty doesn't know</i>

127
00:09:41.475 --> 00:09:43.227
Cooper Harris, you're a pig.

128
00:09:43.394 --> 00:09:47.231
Uh, Candy, before you go, uh,
you might wanna clean that off.

129
00:09:48.983 --> 00:09:50.025
Clean what off?

130
00:09:50.192 --> 00:09:53.237
It's like, uh, dirt, or something.
Go like this.

131
00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:59.910
Well, no, it's kind of
under, and to the side...

132
00:10:00.077 --> 00:10:02.288
...and under.

133
00:10:02.454 --> 00:10:04.206
- Is it off?
- No.

134
00:10:05.082 --> 00:10:07.293
I think your top is
getting in the way.

135
00:10:08.752 --> 00:10:11.255
- Really?
- Trust me.

136
00:10:20.306 --> 00:10:22.850
That's better. Uh,
but keep rubbing it.

137
00:10:28.647 --> 00:10:31.400
<i>I did it with her
on his birthday.</i>

138
00:10:32.901 --> 00:10:35.237
<i>Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know.</i>

139
00:10:35.404 --> 00:10:38.449
<i>Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know.</i>

140
00:10:38.615 --> 00:10:41.952
<i>Don't tell Scotty
Scotty doesn't know.</i>

141
00:10:43.037 --> 00:10:45.622
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

142
00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:48.042
No, it's just not coming off.

143
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:53.589
- What is it?
- Fine, I'll do it. Come here.

144
00:10:54.423 --> 00:10:56.050
Oh, my God. Candy.

145
00:10:57.509 --> 00:10:59.094
Cooper.

146
00:11:00.137 --> 00:11:01.513
Hey.

147
00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:05.100
This isn't where
I parked my car.

148
00:11:07.519 --> 00:11:08.729
<i>Scotty doesn't know.</i>

149
00:11:11.023 --> 00:11:14.276
<i>Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know.</i>

150
00:11:14.443 --> 00:11:17.237
<i>Scotty doesn't know Scotty
doesn't, Scotty doesn't...</i>

151
00:11:17.404 --> 00:11:18.447
Hey.

152
00:11:18.781 --> 00:11:21.658
<i>Scotty doesn't know.
Scotty doesn't know.</i>

153
00:11:23.869 --> 00:11:25.829
This band rocks.

154
00:11:25.996 --> 00:11:27.498
Yeah.

155
00:11:52.106 --> 00:11:53.607
<i>Mail,</i> motherfucker.

156
00:12:01.031 --> 00:12:02.282
Hey, Mieke.

157
00:12:02.449 --> 00:12:08.205
"Dear Scott, I was very sad to hear about
your lady woman, Fiona, dumping you."

158
00:12:08.372 --> 00:12:12.126
Since you no longer have a girlfriend,
maybe I could come to America...

159
00:12:12.292 --> 00:12:14.157
...and we could get to
know each other better.

160
00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:16.046
Perhaps we could...

161
00:12:17.673 --> 00:12:18.715
<i>"...zussamen."</i>

162
00:12:18.882 --> 00:12:21.802
What the fuck is "zussamen"?

163
00:12:28.892 --> 00:12:30.269
"Arrange a meeting."

164
00:12:30.436 --> 00:12:33.439
No, no, no. Come on.
Cooper was right.

165
00:12:33.605 --> 00:12:35.315
This guy wants to
have sex with me.

166
00:12:35.482 --> 00:12:39.153
Um, "listen, Mieke..."

167
00:12:39.319 --> 00:12:41.822
...I don't want to arrange
any meetings with you.

168
00:12:42.739 --> 00:12:44.616
You sick, German freak.

169
00:12:44.783 --> 00:12:47.911
So please keep your hands
off my genitals...

170
00:12:48.078 --> 00:12:53.000
...and never write to me again,
and don't come to America.

171
00:12:53.167 --> 00:12:54.460
"Good bye."

172
00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:00.883
Ow.

173
00:13:13.896 --> 00:13:16.231
I'm never drinking again.

174
00:13:16.857 --> 00:13:18.025
Oh, that's nice.

175
00:13:22.321 --> 00:13:25.157
- Bert, what are you doing?
- Reading your e-mail.

176
00:13:25.324 --> 00:13:26.950
Don't do that.

177
00:13:29.286 --> 00:13:30.787
Why are you wearing my bathrobe?

178
00:13:31.705 --> 00:13:33.123
Oh, I'm sorry...

179
00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:36.293
...but somebody pissed all
over mine last night.

180
00:13:38.462 --> 00:13:42.549
Wow. I can't believe this German chick
wants to come here and hook up with you.

181
00:13:42.716 --> 00:13:45.093
I don't think so, buddy.
Mieke's a guy.

182
00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.222
<i>Um, no, it says</i> right <i>here,
"trauriges madchen. ".</i>

183
00:13:48.388 --> 00:13:50.891
"I was a sad girl to
hear about Fiona."

184
00:13:51.058 --> 00:13:54.937
I'm taking Intro to German,
and even I know that.

185
00:13:55.103 --> 00:13:56.355
Come here.

186
00:13:56.522 --> 00:13:58.440
He sent me a picture, retardo.

187
00:13:58.607 --> 00:14:02.277
See? That's a picture of Mieke
and that's his cute cousin, Jan.

188
00:14:02.444 --> 00:14:04.238
No, retardo.

189
00:14:04.404 --> 00:14:07.991
That's Jan, a man's name,
and that's not "Mike."

190
00:14:08.158 --> 00:14:11.078
It's "Mieke". A common
German girl's name...

191
00:14:11.245 --> 00:14:12.829
...similar to our Michelle.

192
00:14:13.455 --> 00:14:16.458
I hope you wrote her back and
told her to come and visit.

193
00:14:18.919 --> 00:14:20.629
You didn't?

194
00:14:20.796 --> 00:14:22.714
You thought she was a guy.

195
00:14:22.881 --> 00:14:25.717
I'm getting the video camera.
Ha.

196
00:14:27.219 --> 00:14:30.138
- What an asshole.
- No. No.

197
00:14:30.472 --> 00:14:31.932
No.

198
00:14:32.099 --> 00:14:35.519
No!

199
00:15:05.841 --> 00:15:07.884
"Address blocked"?
"E-mail not delivered."

200
00:15:08.051 --> 00:15:10.512
No. No, come on.

201
00:15:11.305 --> 00:15:13.390
Hey, Mom made waffles.

202
00:15:13.557 --> 00:15:16.685
- What's going on?
- I'm in love with my pen pal.

203
00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:19.146
I'm in love with Mieke.

204
00:15:21.648 --> 00:15:24.860
Okay. Okay.

205
00:15:25.027 --> 00:15:28.155
You know what? I was
actually expecting this.

206
00:15:28.322 --> 00:15:32.242
And frankly, I'm flattered you
picked me to come out to first.

207
00:15:32.409 --> 00:15:35.287
And don't worry about
telling your folks...

208
00:15:35.454 --> 00:15:36.982
...because, uh, I think
they already know.

209
00:15:36.995 --> 00:15:38.534
No, you idiot.
Mieke is a girl.

210
00:15:38.624 --> 00:15:42.044
No, no, I get it. Yeah. He's the
girl, and you're the girl...

211
00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:44.671
...and sometimes, uh,
you're both the girl.

212
00:15:45.589 --> 00:15:48.884
Right? Right? That's hot.

213
00:15:49.426 --> 00:15:52.471
But whatever works for you.
I'm not gonna judge it.

214
00:15:52.638 --> 00:15:55.557
Will you stop? Look, come here.
Look at this picture.

215
00:15:57.267 --> 00:15:58.560
Wow. Who's the hot chick?

216
00:15:58.727 --> 00:16:01.730
That's Mieke. I mean, Mieke.

217
00:16:01.897 --> 00:16:04.775
That's Mieke? That's who you've
been writing to all this time?

218
00:16:04.941 --> 00:16:07.369
Until last night, when
I took your advice and

219
00:16:07.382 --> 00:16:09.821
told her to keep her
hands off my genitals.

220
00:16:09.988 --> 00:16:13.659
Given what we know now, that seems like
the exact opposite of what you want.

221
00:16:16.411 --> 00:16:18.163
This is a total disaster.

222
00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:21.166
Oh, come on. It's not that bad.

223
00:16:21.583 --> 00:16:23.001
Though she is really hot.

224
00:16:23.168 --> 00:16:26.296
You're not listening. I don't
even care what she looks like.

225
00:16:26.463 --> 00:16:29.633
Mieke and I, we had
this incredible bond.

226
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.718
I told her things I
couldn't even tell you.

227
00:16:33.428 --> 00:16:34.763
Like what?

228
00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:36.848
Nothing. It's a figure
of speech, Coop.

229
00:16:37.015 --> 00:16:38.935
- No, seriously. What?
- Nothing. The point is...

230
00:16:39.101 --> 00:16:40.662
- You like me better, right?
- Listen...

231
00:16:40.811 --> 00:16:45.065
...this girl is not only smart and
funny, and stunningly beautiful...

232
00:16:45.232 --> 00:16:48.276
...but until I screwed up, she wanted
to come all the way to America...

233
00:16:48.443 --> 00:16:49.486
...just to be with me.

234
00:16:49.653 --> 00:16:52.864
- So do something about it.
- What can I do?

235
00:16:53.031 --> 00:16:56.201
She blocked her e-mail account,
her phone number's not listed.

236
00:16:56.368 --> 00:16:58.245
The only thing I know
is she lives in Berlin.

237
00:16:58.620 --> 00:16:59.830
So go to Berlin.

238
00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:03.667
I can't just go to Berlin, Coop.

239
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.752
- Why not?
- Because.

240
00:17:06.169 --> 00:17:09.840
I just can't, okay? I'm supposed
to work for my Dad this summer.

241
00:17:10.006 --> 00:17:12.050
It looks good on my
med-school application.

242
00:17:12.217 --> 00:17:13.844
Oh, Jesus, Scotty.

243
00:17:14.177 --> 00:17:16.972
Man, Fiona was right.
You're so predictable.

244
00:17:27.107 --> 00:17:28.984
- I'm going to Germany.
- No.

245
00:17:29.443 --> 00:17:31.361
We're going to Germany.

246
00:17:39.703 --> 00:17:41.163
How are we going
to get to Germany?

247
00:17:41.329 --> 00:17:43.790
Don't worry. I've
got it covered.

248
00:17:45.876 --> 00:17:47.627
We're going to be couriers?

249
00:17:47.794 --> 00:17:49.395
It's the best way to
get a cheap flight.

250
00:17:49.546 --> 00:17:53.216
All we have to do is carry their packages,
and then drop them off when we get there.

251
00:17:53.383 --> 00:17:55.303
- My cousin did it when he went to India.
- Yeah?

252
00:17:55.469 --> 00:17:59.639
Yeah. Of course, he, uh, ended up using
a public restroom in New Delhi...

253
00:17:59.806 --> 00:18:03.101
...and, uh, they had to cut off his leg.
You know...

254
00:18:03.268 --> 00:18:06.062
...but he got there cheap,
is what I'm saying.

255
00:18:06.229 --> 00:18:09.566
Okay, I don't have anything
to Germany for a week.

256
00:18:09.733 --> 00:18:13.570
Uh, but I can get you both
to London today for $118.

257
00:18:13.737 --> 00:18:15.060
Anything else?

258
00:18:15.073 --> 00:18:16.406
Europe is like the size
of the Eastwood Mall.

259
00:18:16.573 --> 00:18:18.241
We can walk to
Berlin from there.

260
00:18:19.326 --> 00:18:20.911
Cooper, England's an island.

261
00:18:21.077 --> 00:18:24.039
Okay, swim. Whatever.

262
00:18:24.206 --> 00:18:25.248
We'll take it.

263
00:18:40.388 --> 00:18:41.640
- Hey.
- "Hmm?"

264
00:18:41.807 --> 00:18:43.016
Thanks for coming with me.

265
00:18:43.183 --> 00:18:45.894
I know you had that internship
at the law firm this summer.

266
00:18:46.061 --> 00:18:48.063
Well, forget about the law firm.

267
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:51.691
And don't thank me. I
should be thanking you.

268
00:18:52.067 --> 00:18:54.453
This trip is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

269
00:18:54.466 --> 00:18:56.863
for me to broaden
my sexual horizons.

270
00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:59.366
Ha, ha. What are
you talking about?

271
00:18:59.825 --> 00:19:01.618
I'm talking about
crazy European sex.

272
00:19:01.785 --> 00:19:03.245
Ah.

273
00:19:04.538 --> 00:19:07.415
- You know America was founded by prudes.
- Mm.

274
00:19:07.582 --> 00:19:09.042
Prudes who left Europe...

275
00:19:09.209 --> 00:19:14.214
...because they hated all the kinky,
steamy European sex that was going on.

276
00:19:14.381 --> 00:19:17.801
And now I, uh, Cooper Harris...

277
00:19:17.968 --> 00:19:20.929
...will return to the land of
my perverted forefathers...

278
00:19:21.096 --> 00:19:23.056
...and claim my birthright...

279
00:19:23.223 --> 00:19:28.937
...which is a series of erotic and
sexually challenging adventures.

280
00:19:30.188 --> 00:19:32.691
You've really thought a lot
about this, haven't you?

281
00:19:33.775 --> 00:19:35.318
It's my passion.

282
00:19:49.958 --> 00:19:52.043
Come on, come on.

283
00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.755
The adventure begins.

284
00:19:55.922 --> 00:19:58.341
Welcome to jolly old England.

285
00:19:58.508 --> 00:20:01.970
Yeah, breathe that sweet,
sexy, European air.

286
00:20:03.722 --> 00:20:05.098
- Oh.
- What is that?

287
00:20:05.265 --> 00:20:07.726
Uh, it's the phone they
gave me at the law firm.

288
00:20:07.893 --> 00:20:09.436
Yeah, it's pretty neat, huh?

289
00:20:09.603 --> 00:20:11.897
- Works anywhere.
- Yeah?

290
00:20:12.063 --> 00:20:13.398
Excuse me.

291
00:20:14.149 --> 00:20:15.692
Cooper here.

292
00:20:16.109 --> 00:20:17.819
Hello, Mr. Walters.

293
00:20:17.986 --> 00:20:20.572
Uh, yes, sir, I'm
down in file storage.

294
00:20:21.239 --> 00:20:23.283
Uh, hang on one second.

295
00:20:28.622 --> 00:20:31.207
No, sir, I can't find the
Gutterman file anywhere.

296
00:20:31.374 --> 00:20:33.084
Yes, sir, I'll keep looking.

297
00:20:33.251 --> 00:20:35.754
No, I don't rest
until I find it.

298
00:20:36.421 --> 00:20:38.465
Didn't tell your boss you
were leaving the country?

299
00:20:38.632 --> 00:20:40.312
- They would've stopped paying me.
- Right.

300
00:20:40.383 --> 00:20:41.885
It seemed easier.

301
00:20:42.052 --> 00:20:44.304
- So where to?
- Uh, I don't know.

302
00:20:44.471 --> 00:20:46.391
First bus to Berlin doesn't
leave till tomorrow.

303
00:20:46.473 --> 00:20:48.683
What do you wanna do? Got
the Tower of London...

304
00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:50.936
...there's Buckingham Palace.

305
00:20:51.978 --> 00:20:53.688
- Uh...
- There's no drinking age.

306
00:20:53.855 --> 00:20:55.273
- There you go.
- Come on.

307
00:20:57.067 --> 00:20:58.443
Hey. "The Feisty Goat."

308
00:21:03.657 --> 00:21:05.033
All right.

309
00:21:05.951 --> 00:21:07.702
What do you wanna...?

310
00:21:18.171 --> 00:21:19.881
Soccer hooligans.

311
00:21:24.552 --> 00:21:27.681
Hey, this isn't where
I parked my car.

312
00:21:27.847 --> 00:21:29.182
(Dy-.

313
00:21:30.225 --> 00:21:32.185
Who the bloody hell are you?

314
00:21:33.561 --> 00:21:37.732
This is a private members bar,
exclusively for the supporters...

315
00:21:37.899 --> 00:21:40.652
...of the greatest football
team in the world:

316
00:21:40.986 --> 00:21:43.321
Manchester United.

317
00:21:43.697 --> 00:21:46.449
Now, please, enlighten me.

318
00:21:46.866 --> 00:21:48.118
Who the fuck are you?

319
00:21:48.451 --> 00:21:52.163
That is a good
question, and, Scotty?

320
00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:53.748
Huh?

321
00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:59.963
We're the Manchester
United Fan Club...

322
00:22:00.463 --> 00:22:02.173
...from Ohio.

323
00:22:03.049 --> 00:22:05.260
If you're Manchester
United supporters...

324
00:22:05.427 --> 00:22:07.679
...sing the Manchester
United song.

325
00:22:07.846 --> 00:22:10.640
Ahem. Excuse me, I'm sorry.
I'm not much of a singer.

326
00:22:10.807 --> 00:22:12.559
Aah! Sing!

327
00:22:12.726 --> 00:22:16.271
<i>My baby takes the
morning train.</i>

328
00:22:16.855 --> 00:22:21.651
<i>He works from 9 to 5 and then.</i>

329
00:22:21.818 --> 00:22:25.488
<i>He takes another home again.</i>

330
00:22:25.905 --> 00:22:27.866
To <i>find</i> me...

331
00:22:29.367 --> 00:22:33.747
Watching the Manchester
United football team.

332
00:22:33.913 --> 00:22:35.081
Huh?

333
00:22:35.248 --> 00:22:39.044
The best freaking team in all the land.
Woo-hoo!

334
00:22:46.259 --> 00:22:47.343
Pretty good.

335
00:22:47.886 --> 00:22:50.180
- Pretty dang good, lads.
- Yeah.

336
00:23:09.699 --> 00:23:13.369
<i>To find me waiting for him</i>

337
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:22.754
I've unblocked your
e-mail address...

338
00:23:22.962 --> 00:23:25.799
...but this Scott
is not responding.

339
00:23:28.176 --> 00:23:29.803
He was the one.

340
00:23:32.013 --> 00:23:34.224
I was going to give
myself to him.

341
00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:38.311
Perhaps you should give
yourself to someone else.

342
00:24:04.379 --> 00:24:06.756
I'm never drinking again.

343
00:24:06.923 --> 00:24:08.508
Coop, wake up.

344
00:24:08.675 --> 00:24:12.095
Oh, man, that was a wild night.

345
00:24:14.097 --> 00:24:15.431
You think?

346
00:24:23.106 --> 00:24:25.108
Scotty, where the
hell are we going?

347
00:24:25.275 --> 00:24:29.154
Don't worry. If anything bad
happens, my parents will find us.

348
00:24:29.654 --> 00:24:32.323
Honey, where's Scotty?

349
00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:34.200
Cooper said they
were going camping.

350
00:24:34.367 --> 00:24:37.203
Oh. That's nice.

351
00:24:37.745 --> 00:24:39.122
And where's Bert?

352
00:24:39.289 --> 00:24:41.457
Fuck if I know.

353
00:24:51.134 --> 00:24:55.138
Hey! How are you, you scalawag.

354
00:24:55.305 --> 00:24:57.849
Look, given the current
geopolitical climate...

355
00:24:58.016 --> 00:25:00.810
...all European countries should
have a seat at the table.

356
00:25:00.977 --> 00:25:03.730
- Right.
- Except those fucking Ities.

357
00:25:03.897 --> 00:25:05.982
I hate them Italian bastards.

358
00:25:06.149 --> 00:25:07.775
- You know what I mean?
- Excuse me.

359
00:25:07.942 --> 00:25:09.235
Hello, boy-o.

360
00:25:09.402 --> 00:25:11.070
What the hell
happened last night?

361
00:25:11.237 --> 00:25:13.781
You got steamed up,
pissed as a fart.

362
00:25:13.948 --> 00:25:15.658
Too much sauce, son.

363
00:25:15.825 --> 00:25:19.704
Don't worry. We come and got you
so you wouldn't miss the trip.

364
00:25:19.871 --> 00:25:22.540
What trip?

365
00:25:22.707 --> 00:25:24.000
Where are we going?

366
00:25:24.167 --> 00:25:26.628
Where are we going? We're going
to see the Mighty Reds...

367
00:25:26.794 --> 00:25:29.047
...do the frogs in Paris.
Aren't we, boys?

368
00:25:29.214 --> 00:25:31.341
Yeah.

369
00:25:31.883 --> 00:25:33.551
Why are you yelling at me?

370
00:25:33.718 --> 00:25:36.262
So I tell the swamp
donkey to sack it...

371
00:25:36.429 --> 00:25:38.973
...before I give her a tonk in
the tradesman's entrance...

372
00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:41.517
...and have her lick me yarbles.

373
00:25:43.436 --> 00:25:45.063
Wow.

374
00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:48.274
You guys are on like a completely
different level of swearing over here.

375
00:25:48.733 --> 00:25:51.361
Coop? Cooper, we're
going to Paris.

376
00:25:51.527 --> 00:25:53.488
I know. Cecil told me.

377
00:25:53.655 --> 00:25:55.990
Mieke's in Berlin. We're
not going to Berlin.

378
00:25:56.157 --> 00:25:57.742
What are we gonna do?
We need a plan.

379
00:25:57.909 --> 00:26:01.496
See what I'm talking about? This
is predictable Scotty talking.

380
00:26:01.663 --> 00:26:04.008
Relax. Paris is practically
a suburb of Berlin.

381
00:26:04.021 --> 00:26:06.376
It's a nothing commute.

382
00:26:06.542 --> 00:26:08.795
This is why France and Germany
have always been allies.

383
00:26:08.962 --> 00:26:10.046
Allies.

384
00:26:12.715 --> 00:26:15.218
The twins. The twins
were in Paris, right?

385
00:26:15.468 --> 00:26:16.896
We could give them a call.
They could help us out.

386
00:26:16.909 --> 00:26:18.348
Let me see your phone.

387
00:26:18.721 --> 00:26:21.557
All right, but I'm really only supposed
to use this for business calls.

388
00:26:22.684 --> 00:26:23.977
Hey, don't...

389
00:26:40.827 --> 00:26:44.664
You're on the wrong side of the
road, you snail-eating poofs.

390
00:26:44.831 --> 00:26:49.252
Fuck off. Go on, you Gaelic
fucking garlic-breath tossers.

391
00:26:49.419 --> 00:26:53.381
Piss off. Get in here and say
that, you froggy, Itie shities.

392
00:26:58.261 --> 00:27:02.056
Fucking beep. We'll beep, you
bastard, all over your fucking nose.

393
00:27:02.223 --> 00:27:04.934
Get out of the way. Piss off.

394
00:27:12.358 --> 00:27:16.029
Hey, lads. That wanker's got
a frog football shirt on.

395
00:27:16.195 --> 00:27:18.948
Let's give this Nancy a
fucking good kicking.

396
00:27:19.115 --> 00:27:21.159
Come on, lads, he's going off.

397
00:27:36.341 --> 00:27:39.010
All right. Twins said
they'd meet us here.

398
00:27:39.177 --> 00:27:42.055
- Look at that.
- There they are. Come on. Jenny.

399
00:27:42.221 --> 00:27:44.223
- Jamie.
- Hey.

400
00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:45.683
Come here.

401
00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:46.893
No, no. No, no, no.

402
00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:49.479
- Scott, bienvenue a Paris.
- Thank you. Thank you.

403
00:27:49.645 --> 00:27:52.065
- What is that a new camera?
- This isn't just a camera...

404
00:27:52.231 --> 00:27:53.775
...this is a Leica M7.

405
00:27:53.941 --> 00:27:57.945
Über-sensitive exposure settings,
legendary cloth-shutter system.

406
00:27:58.112 --> 00:28:00.531
- Let me see that thing.
- No can do.

407
00:28:00.698 --> 00:28:03.618
I spent the last four years tutoring
lacrosse players to pay for it...

408
00:28:03.785 --> 00:28:06.746
...so nobody touches
my camera but me.

409
00:28:06.913 --> 00:28:09.082
- So it's like your Wiener.
- No, it's not like my...

410
00:28:09.248 --> 00:28:11.292
- Jenny.
- Cooper, leave him alone.

411
00:28:11.459 --> 00:28:14.754
Wow, I can't believe you came all
the way to Europe for a girl.

412
00:28:14.921 --> 00:28:18.466
Oh, wait, no, not just any girl.
Show her the picture, Scotty.

413
00:28:18.633 --> 00:28:21.094
She makes every girl in our
high school look like a walrus.

414
00:28:21.803 --> 00:28:24.806
- I'm a girl from your high school.
- No, I mean "girl" girls.

415
00:28:25.515 --> 00:28:27.725
Guys, we're wasting the whole day here.
We're in Paris.

416
00:28:27.892 --> 00:28:29.185
Let's go to the Louvre.

417
00:28:29.352 --> 00:28:31.104
To the Louvre.

418
00:29:05.805 --> 00:29:07.306
So you guys wanna stay here...

419
00:29:07.473 --> 00:29:10.351
...or should we check out the
huge line at the Eiffel Tower?

420
00:29:10.518 --> 00:29:11.644
Here's a fun fact.

421
00:29:11.811 --> 00:29:14.397
Voltaire contracted syphilis
just two blocks from here.

422
00:29:14.564 --> 00:29:16.691
- Should we go?
- Can we please get out of here?

423
00:29:16.858 --> 00:29:19.861
- This guy's really creeping me out.
- Who, robot man?

424
00:29:20.027 --> 00:29:22.530
He's just trying to
feed his robot family.

425
00:29:22.697 --> 00:29:25.324
- I really don't like him.
- Why?

426
00:29:25.491 --> 00:29:27.034
Because he's doing this?

427
00:29:28.619 --> 00:29:30.299
All right. Okay,
seriously, don't do that.

428
00:29:30.455 --> 00:29:32.707
Cooper. Do not hate me.

429
00:29:35.793 --> 00:29:39.797
I am familiar with over 600 dance
moves and I am programmed to get:

430
00:29:44.469 --> 00:29:45.970
Freaky.

431
00:29:58.149 --> 00:30:01.360
Ha, ha. You're just upset because
people like me better. It's okay.

432
00:30:27.011 --> 00:30:28.137
Oh.

433
00:30:41.776 --> 00:30:43.361
Fight. Fight.

434
00:30:47.949 --> 00:30:49.617
Break the leg, Scott.

435
00:31:06.175 --> 00:31:08.177
Don't look in his eyes, Scotty.

436
00:31:14.433 --> 00:31:16.143
- Oh.
- That was not cool.

437
00:31:47.633 --> 00:31:49.051
Guys, let's go. Come on.

438
00:31:52.847 --> 00:31:56.475
Error. Error. Error.

439
00:31:58.102 --> 00:31:59.312
How cool is this?

440
00:31:59.812 --> 00:32:02.023
It's a shame we only get
to spend one day together.

441
00:32:02.189 --> 00:32:04.775
- Why don't you come to Berlin?
- Mm, no.

442
00:32:04.942 --> 00:32:07.862
Jamie, come on. In a few months,
we all go to different colleges.

443
00:32:08.029 --> 00:32:11.407
This could be the last chance the
four of us are together like this.

444
00:32:11.574 --> 00:32:14.368
Plus, we're in Europe. Huh?

445
00:32:14.535 --> 00:32:16.245
This should be the
trip of a lifetime.

446
00:32:16.412 --> 00:32:18.247
There's no way we
should split up.

447
00:32:19.165 --> 00:32:22.418
All right, this table
is now Europe, okay?

448
00:32:22.585 --> 00:32:27.632
Ahem. Excuse me. We are
right here, in Paris...

449
00:32:27.798 --> 00:32:32.261
...and I have got to get to Mieke,
who is over here, in Berlin.

450
00:32:32.428 --> 00:32:36.599
If you come with us, I'm sure there's a
ton of great stuff to see along the way.

451
00:32:38.142 --> 00:32:40.519
- We can go to Denmark.
- I love Denmark.

452
00:32:40.686 --> 00:32:43.230
- We gotta hit Amsterdam.
- Definitely.

453
00:32:43.397 --> 00:32:46.067
And the cathedral at Cameret.

454
00:32:48.027 --> 00:32:49.654
- Yeah. Maybe.
- Maybe. We'll see.

455
00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:52.490
- Whatever.
- If there's time.

456
00:32:53.658 --> 00:32:57.036
Come on. I really want you to
be there when I meet Mieke.

457
00:32:57.203 --> 00:32:58.913
- Fine.
- Excellent.

458
00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:01.582
- All right. A toast.
- Yes.

459
00:33:01.749 --> 00:33:04.960
- Ahem. To Mieke.
- To Europe.

460
00:33:05.127 --> 00:33:06.462
To Europe.

461
00:33:09.423 --> 00:33:12.301
- Berlin, here we come.
- All right.

462
00:33:12.468 --> 00:33:14.512
Better let me hold on to those.

463
00:33:18.891 --> 00:33:21.894
- What the hell is that?
- It's a traveler's money belt.

464
00:33:22.144 --> 00:33:24.230
Frommer's says as long as
you have one of these...

465
00:33:24.397 --> 00:33:26.065
...no one can rob
you of anything.

466
00:33:26.607 --> 00:33:27.650
Except your dignity.

467
00:33:27.942 --> 00:33:29.860
No, you just put that in your...

468
00:33:30.444 --> 00:33:31.696
Wait, what?

469
00:33:32.697 --> 00:33:34.990
Come on, Guidebook. Let's go.

470
00:33:37.201 --> 00:33:38.244
Check it out.

471
00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:40.788
European ass.

472
00:33:43.332 --> 00:33:44.458
What's up?

473
00:33:47.628 --> 00:33:51.132
Jesus, Jenny. I thought
you were some...

474
00:33:51.632 --> 00:33:53.426
...girl. Come on. Platform 4.

475
00:33:54.218 --> 00:33:55.594
Thanks.

476
00:33:57.471 --> 00:33:58.806
Damn.

477
00:34:02.101 --> 00:34:04.019
I believe this is yours.

478
00:34:07.982 --> 00:34:09.442
Pleased to meet you.

479
00:34:09.608 --> 00:34:11.152
My name is Christoph.

480
00:34:11.318 --> 00:34:13.904
- Jenny, let's go.
- Come on, move it.

481
00:34:14.071 --> 00:34:16.949
Those are my friends. We're supposed
to get on a train to Berlin...

482
00:34:17.116 --> 00:34:19.577
- Jenny!
- I'm coming!

483
00:34:20.828 --> 00:34:23.080
So it was really
nice to meet you.

484
00:34:23.664 --> 00:34:25.040
The pleasure was all mine.

485
00:34:27.168 --> 00:34:28.544
Jennifer.

486
00:35:12.838 --> 00:35:15.633
<i>Scotty doesn't know
That Fiona and me.</i>

487
00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:18.219
<i>Do it in my van on Sundays.</i>

488
00:35:18.385 --> 00:35:19.970
<i>Tells him she's...</i>

489
00:35:20.137 --> 00:35:21.514
What?

490
00:35:21.972 --> 00:35:24.099
You gotta admit, it's
a really catchy tune.

491
00:35:26.477 --> 00:35:29.522
<i>Tells him she's in church
But she doesn't go.</i>

492
00:35:29.688 --> 00:35:32.983
<i>Still she's on her knees
And Scotty doesn't know.</i>

493
00:35:33.526 --> 00:35:34.735
<i>Scotty doesn't know.</i>

494
00:35:35.069 --> 00:35:36.195
<i>Scotty doesn't...</i>

495
00:35:50.584 --> 00:35:53.754
You know, there are a lot of
other empty compartments.

496
00:35:54.296 --> 00:35:55.422
Huh?

497
00:35:55.589 --> 00:35:56.632
Ah.

498
00:36:32.418 --> 00:36:33.586
Pardon me.

499
00:36:33.752 --> 00:36:35.337
Eh?

500
00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:37.756
Oh.

501
00:36:48.142 --> 00:36:49.768
Oh, ow!

502
00:37:07.202 --> 00:37:08.495
Hi.

503
00:37:21.926 --> 00:37:23.636
What the hell are you doing?

504
00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:27.765
No. No, no, no.

505
00:37:29.308 --> 00:37:30.809
- Uh-oh.
- What?

506
00:37:31.143 --> 00:37:32.561
Big tunnel.

507
00:37:35.731 --> 00:37:38.317
Who's touching me?
Scotty, is that you?

508
00:37:39.276 --> 00:37:40.569
Who's touching me? Scotty.

509
00:38:07.388 --> 00:38:10.015
Crane Sur Mer. We
change trains here.

510
00:38:12.101 --> 00:38:14.728
Well, we got a couple
of hours to kill.

511
00:38:14.895 --> 00:38:16.605
What's there to
see in this town?

512
00:38:16.772 --> 00:38:19.608
<i>Hello? The Monument
des Poissonieres.</i>

513
00:38:19.775 --> 00:38:23.028
It's a monument to all the local
fishermen that were lost at sea.

514
00:38:23.195 --> 00:38:25.948
Frommer's says it's supposed
to be quite moving.

515
00:38:26.115 --> 00:38:29.243
What the hell is wrong
with you, C-3PO?

516
00:38:29.410 --> 00:38:31.829
We're here to see Europe,
not some crappy statue.

517
00:38:32.955 --> 00:38:36.417
I'm taking a nap. Wake me up
when the train gets here.

518
00:38:36.583 --> 00:38:39.253
Hmm. Says here this town
has a famous nude beach.

519
00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:42.047
All right, we can't all
just lie around all Clay.

520
00:38:42.214 --> 00:38:44.800
We gotta get out there and
experience the culture firsthand.

521
00:38:44.967 --> 00:38:47.094
Let's go exploring.

522
00:38:50.014 --> 00:38:52.474
So, what's the
etiquette on boners?

523
00:38:52.641 --> 00:38:57.438
Do I roll over and dig out a hole for it
or is it cool to just let my flag fly?

524
00:38:58.022 --> 00:39:00.065
Wait, wait, wait.

525
00:39:00.232 --> 00:39:02.693
Does "nude beach" mean we
have to get naked too?

526
00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:04.403
Of course.

527
00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:08.032
Do you think you can go an hour
without your currency colostomy bag?

528
00:39:08.198 --> 00:39:11.618
Hey. Hey, as long as this thing has
our money and passports in it...

529
00:39:11.785 --> 00:39:15.039
...it's not coming off, and my
trunks aren't coming off, either.

530
00:39:15.205 --> 00:39:18.542
Come on, Jamie. You came
all the way to Europe.

531
00:39:18.709 --> 00:39:20.586
Can't wimp out now.

532
00:39:22.546 --> 00:39:23.797
Okay.

533
00:39:23.964 --> 00:39:26.091
- All right, on the count of three.
- Here we go.

534
00:39:26.258 --> 00:39:28.761
- Ahem.
- Three, two, one...

535
00:39:28.927 --> 00:39:30.637
Ha, ha. Look at Jamie's penis.

536
00:39:30.804 --> 00:39:33.057
- Ha, ha.
- Very funny. Very funny.

537
00:39:33.223 --> 00:39:36.101
All right. All right. Ahem.

538
00:39:36.268 --> 00:39:39.104
Let the crazy, European
sex odyssey begin.

539
00:39:39.271 --> 00:39:40.397
- Here we go.
- Really?

540
00:39:40.564 --> 00:39:42.316
- Yes.
- Mm-hm.

541
00:39:46.653 --> 00:39:48.197
Hello, ladies.

542
00:39:53.577 --> 00:39:56.580
- Ladies?
- Bitches?

543
00:39:57.456 --> 00:40:01.794
Ew. What a rip. There's no nude girls here,
just guys like us looking for nude girls.

544
00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.545
I don't understand.

545
00:40:03.921 --> 00:40:07.466
<i>Evans Sur Met has one of the best
nude beaches on the continent.</i>

546
00:40:07.633 --> 00:40:09.384
However...

547
00:40:12.346 --> 00:40:14.586
...during the summer,
the European women are

548
00:40:14.599 --> 00:40:16.850
chased away by gawking
male tourists...

549
00:40:17.017 --> 00:40:20.104
...so Europe's most nubile exhibitionists
head to the deserted beach...

550
00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:23.023
<i>"...right next to the
Monument des Poissonieres. ".</i>

551
00:40:39.331 --> 00:40:42.126
There's so many penises.

552
00:40:42.709 --> 00:40:45.671
Frommer's tried to tell you,
but you just didn't listen.

553
00:40:45.838 --> 00:40:47.798
This is the biggest
sausage fest on earth.

554
00:40:47.965 --> 00:40:50.551
It's the International
House of Sausage.

555
00:40:50.801 --> 00:40:52.219
Hey.

556
00:40:53.637 --> 00:40:56.932
- Thanks for waiting.
- You're not missing anything.

557
00:40:57.099 --> 00:40:58.350
It's all guys.

558
00:40:59.017 --> 00:41:01.687
Well, at least the sun's out.

559
00:41:29.173 --> 00:41:30.549
Holy crap.

560
00:41:30.716 --> 00:41:33.552
What? I thought this
was a nude beach.

561
00:41:33.886 --> 00:41:35.929
No!

562
00:41:40.601 --> 00:41:41.977
- Huh?
- No, no.

563
00:41:42.144 --> 00:41:43.632
What? What are you doing?

564
00:41:43.645 --> 00:41:45.144
Jenny, you gotta cover up.
Cover up, cover up.

565
00:41:45.397 --> 00:41:46.940
Girl?

566
00:41:47.107 --> 00:41:48.150
Girl.

567
00:41:48.317 --> 00:41:49.860
<i>Ooh, girl. Girl. Ooh, girl.</i>

568
00:41:53.363 --> 00:41:55.949
<i>Girl. Girl.</i>

569
00:41:56.116 --> 00:41:57.284
Run.

570
00:42:03.916 --> 00:42:05.542
I'm not gonna make it.

571
00:42:05.709 --> 00:42:08.337
- Go on without me.
- All right. See you.

572
00:42:32.736 --> 00:42:35.447
Are you reading, uh,
Mieke's old e-mails again?

573
00:42:35.614 --> 00:42:37.574
Mm-hm. Yeah.

574
00:42:38.742 --> 00:42:43.038
I have no idea what I'm going to
say to that girl when I see her.

575
00:42:43.872 --> 00:42:46.458
You know, she said I
might be the one?

576
00:42:47.292 --> 00:42:49.044
That's huge.

577
00:42:49.211 --> 00:42:51.588
I've never been
"the one" before.

578
00:42:52.714 --> 00:42:56.510
Thought I was "the one" with Fiona,
but turns out I was, what, 101?

579
00:42:56.677 --> 00:42:58.804
- Two hundred.
- Two hundred.

580
00:42:58.971 --> 00:43:01.056
Look, you got nothing
to worry about.

581
00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:04.601
You'll show up and sweep
her off her German feet.

582
00:43:06.603 --> 00:43:07.896
Thanks.

583
00:43:15.737 --> 00:43:16.947
Yeah.

584
00:43:18.156 --> 00:43:20.033
I Will, Won't I?

585
00:43:22.661 --> 00:43:25.372
I'm so sad and lonely.

586
00:43:25.539 --> 00:43:30.043
I just wish someone would show up
and sweep me off my German feet.

587
00:43:30.544 --> 00:43:32.838
Mieke. I'm here.

588
00:43:33.213 --> 00:43:34.506
Scotty.

589
00:43:34.673 --> 00:43:36.591
About that last e-mail.
I'm so sorry...

590
00:43:36.758 --> 00:43:39.970
The past is the past.
You're here now.

591
00:43:40.137 --> 00:43:42.973
I've been saving myself for you.

592
00:43:43.724 --> 00:43:47.102
Let us make love for
one whole month.

593
00:43:50.981 --> 00:43:53.150
Touch me, Scotty.

594
00:43:56.194 --> 00:43:57.612
0K8

595
00:44:16.173 --> 00:44:17.716
Oh, Scott.

596
00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:15.565
Guys, our train doesn't
leave till morning.

597
00:45:15.732 --> 00:45:17.192
Where will we sleep tonight?

598
00:45:17.359 --> 00:45:18.610
What do you mean, sleep?

599
00:45:19.152 --> 00:45:20.946
We can sleep on the
train tomorrow.

600
00:45:21.113 --> 00:45:22.623
This is the best thing
that could've happened.

601
00:45:22.636 --> 00:45:24.157
We're in Amsterdam.

602
00:45:24.324 --> 00:45:27.369
This is the drug and
sex capital of Europe.

603
00:45:27.869 --> 00:45:29.454
Take a look at this.

604
00:45:31.998 --> 00:45:34.501
"Club Vandersexxx."

605
00:45:34.668 --> 00:45:37.504
"The Red Light District's
hottest sex club."

606
00:45:37.671 --> 00:45:39.965
We have to check it out.
Who's with me?

607
00:45:40.674 --> 00:45:41.883
<i>I'll go.</i>

608
00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:46.096
Fine. Since no one else is willing
to go, I'll just go myself.

609
00:46:00.277 --> 00:46:02.446
<font color="#7F7F7F">d JAXX: <i>"TONIGHT"</i></font>

610
00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:06.450
<i>Sitting, waiting for me.</i>

611
00:46:07.742 --> 00:46:11.288
This is definitely
where I parked my car.

612
00:46:11.455 --> 00:46:13.540
<i>Where we met for
the first time.</i>

613
00:46:13.748 --> 00:46:15.292
Hello there.

614
00:46:17.586 --> 00:46:19.754
Welcome to Club Vandersexxx...

615
00:46:19.921 --> 00:46:22.757
...Amsterdam's most
erotic club...

616
00:46:22.924 --> 00:46:26.303
...where your every fantasy
will be fulfilled.

617
00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:29.514
Also says I get a free
T-shirt with flyer.

618
00:46:32.267 --> 00:46:33.977
He's American.

619
00:46:34.144 --> 00:46:39.274
How sad for you to grow up in
a country founded by prudes.

620
00:46:39.441 --> 00:46:43.028
A country overrun with
crime and illiteracy.

621
00:46:43.195 --> 00:46:46.072
A country where a man is
forced to make sex...

622
00:46:46.239 --> 00:46:47.741
...to only one
woman at a time...

623
00:46:47.908 --> 00:46:51.244
...and one must learn the
woman's name beforehand.

624
00:46:51.411 --> 00:46:54.372
- It was horrible.
- I know.

625
00:46:54.539 --> 00:46:57.125
But you can come with me...

626
00:46:57.292 --> 00:47:00.378
...and let the
Vandersexxx begin.

627
00:47:02.464 --> 00:47:03.757
Ah.

628
00:47:03.924 --> 00:47:06.343
<font color="#7F7F7F">d LINVAL THOMPSON:

00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:07.844
<i>Marijuana in my soul.</i>

630
00:47:08.011 --> 00:47:10.055
<i>Your iguana in my hall</i>

631
00:47:10.222 --> 00:47:11.765
I can't believe
we're doing this.

632
00:47:11.932 --> 00:47:15.685
Don't worry. Hash brownies
are totally legal here.

633
00:47:16.561 --> 00:47:19.272
You're gonna enjoy these, man.
These are magical.

634

- You wanna do this? Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

00:47:32.077 --> 00:47:33.411
- Hi.
- Hi.

637
00:47:33.578 --> 00:47:35.622
I need a new battery
for my camera...

638
00:47:35.789 --> 00:47:38.792
...and while you're at it, it
could use a thorough cleaning.

639
00:47:38.959 --> 00:47:40.544
Wow.

640
00:47:41.336 --> 00:47:42.754
Is that a Leica M6?

641
00:47:42.921 --> 00:47:44.256
Actually, it's an M7.

642
00:47:44.422 --> 00:47:46.591
It's got the built-in
light meter.

643
00:47:47.509 --> 00:47:49.302
It's so beautiful.

644
00:47:50.095 --> 00:47:52.222
So sleek, so powerful.

645
00:47:52.722 --> 00:47:54.349
How's the new lens system?

646
00:47:54.516 --> 00:47:58.395
Ha, ha. Makes the Nikon
look like a disposable.

647
00:47:59.437 --> 00:48:00.897
You really know your cameras.

648
00:48:02.691 --> 00:48:03.942
And you're very cute.

649
00:48:04.192 --> 00:48:06.403
Me? Really?

650
00:48:07.654 --> 00:48:09.114
I'm going on break.

651
00:48:09.281 --> 00:48:11.741
I was going to step out
back and have a cigarette.

652
00:48:11.908 --> 00:48:13.368
Would you like to join me?

653
00:48:14.744 --> 00:48:16.121
I don't smoke.

654
00:48:17.247 --> 00:48:18.373
Neither do I.

655
00:48:26.047 --> 00:48:27.173
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

656
00:48:27.549 --> 00:48:28.925
What is it?

657
00:48:29.426 --> 00:48:30.468
This is great.

658
00:48:31.428 --> 00:48:32.762
You're so innocent.

659
00:48:34.306 --> 00:48:36.600
Let's change that, shall we?

660
00:48:39.227 --> 00:48:40.979
What would you like me to do?

661
00:48:41.146 --> 00:48:43.481
Well, I don't really know.

662
00:48:43.648 --> 00:48:45.609
I guess I haven't
really done that much.

663
00:48:45.775 --> 00:48:49.696
Um, I haven't really found the time,
with all my extracurriculars...

664
00:48:49.863 --> 00:48:53.450
...and model U.N., advanced placement
classes, after-school tutor...

665
00:48:54.909 --> 00:48:56.036
Ah.

666
00:48:57.454 --> 00:48:59.789
Gosh, you really like cameras.

667
00:48:59.956 --> 00:49:03.835
Sometimes, we find our clients are
so overwhelmed with the pleasure...

668
00:49:04.002 --> 00:49:06.963
...that they sometimes
scream out, "no"...

669
00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:09.466
...when really they mean "yes."

670
00:49:10.634 --> 00:49:12.927
And this is why we
have the safe word.

671
00:49:14.304 --> 00:49:15.680
The safe word?

672
00:49:16.765 --> 00:49:19.184
If at any time the ecstasy
gets too great...

673
00:49:19.351 --> 00:49:21.227
...you just use the safe word.

674
00:49:22.854 --> 00:49:25.899
Until we hear the safe
word, we will not stop.

675
00:49:26.816 --> 00:49:28.485
Yeah, right. Stop. All right.

676
00:49:29.986 --> 00:49:31.613
We're going to start slowly...

677
00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:36.409
...teasing you with a little,
light erotic foreplay.

678
00:49:36.576 --> 00:49:38.203
Whee. Ha, ha.

679
00:49:38.370 --> 00:49:41.498
Oh, yes, ladies.

680
00:49:41.665 --> 00:49:44.125
On, on, Vandersexxx!

681
00:49:51.508 --> 00:49:53.385
Hans. Gruber.

682
00:49:57.555 --> 00:49:59.099
Hi.

683
00:50:09.651 --> 00:50:12.654
So are the girls coming back?

Huh? What? Hey.

686
00:50:24.666 --> 00:50:25.750
Safe word.

687
00:50:33.508 --> 00:50:35.969
What is that? That's
not a word, it's a...

688
00:50:49.023 --> 00:50:51.526
- Okay, mister, don't move.
- Excuse me?

689
00:50:51.693 --> 00:50:52.861
Shut the hell up.

690
00:50:53.027 --> 00:50:54.654
Oh, brother. Please
don't hurt me.

691
00:50:54.821 --> 00:50:57.991
Oh, no. You're fine. That's good.
You're fine.

692
00:50:58.450 --> 00:51:00.285
Give me cash? You got cash'?

693
00:51:00.452 --> 00:51:02.454
Take it all, you dirty girl.

694
00:51:03.204 --> 00:51:06.249
What? Your wallet. Focus.

695
00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:09.836
- Give it to me.
- Oh.

696
00:51:10.003 --> 00:51:11.629
Oh, I love you.

697
00:51:12.255 --> 00:51:13.757
I love you.

698
00:51:13.923 --> 00:51:16.593
I love you. I love you.

699
00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:18.928
I love you.

700
00:51:31.149 --> 00:51:32.901
What's so funny?

701
00:51:40.909 --> 00:51:44.412
Mm. I'm really hungry. I
think I've got the munchies.

702
00:51:44.954 --> 00:51:47.207
- Excuse me.
- Huh?

703
00:51:48.666 --> 00:51:50.668
It's hot in here. You hot?
Because I'm really hot.

704
00:51:50.835 --> 00:51:54.005
- Mm, so good.
- Okay, I can't breathe. God.

705
00:51:54.172 --> 00:51:57.133
I'm freaking out. I think we got a
bad batch because I'm freaking out.

706
00:51:57.300 --> 00:51:59.302
I can't... I can't do this.

707
00:51:59.761 --> 00:52:03.848

didn't know until halfway in.

708

The girls never came.

709

- Everything all right with you?
- No, nothing's all right.

711
00:52:14.192 --> 00:52:18.112
You sold us a bad batch of hash brownies.
You're a bad Rastafarian.

712
00:52:18.279 --> 00:52:20.782
These are not hash brownies.

713
00:52:21.574 --> 00:52:22.951
Hmm?

714
00:52:24.327 --> 00:52:27.413
- What was that?
- We do not sell hash brownies here.

715
00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:29.374
We're a simple Dutch bakery.

721

724

What'd you do last night?

728
00:53:34.606 --> 00:53:36.858
I don't want to talk about it.

729
00:53:37.025 --> 00:53:38.067
What did you guys do?

730
00:53:38.234 --> 00:53:40.737
Don't want to talk about it.

731
00:53:42.697 --> 00:53:46.284
- What is that?
- Free T-shirt.

732

Hey, guys.

733
00:53:54.417 --> 00:53:57.420
- What happened to you?
- I got robbed.

734
00:53:57.587 --> 00:53:59.339
It was awesome.

735
00:54:01.174 --> 00:54:03.301
All our money, our
passports, our tickets...

736
00:54:03.468 --> 00:54:05.887
...everything, gone.

737
00:54:07.013 --> 00:54:08.640
How the hell could this happen?

738
00:54:08.806 --> 00:54:11.768
We all go to Amsterdam and
Jamie's the one who hooks up.

739
00:54:13.353 --> 00:54:14.979
For shame.

740

Hello, Mr. Walters.

743
00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:37.543
What do you mean, you never
got the Gutterman file?

744
00:54:37.710 --> 00:54:39.504
I told, uh, Humphrey
to give it to you.

745
00:54:39.671 --> 00:54:43.716
That's hogwash. I handed it
to him myself yesterday.

746
00:54:43.883 --> 00:54:46.970
Yes, sir, I will tell Humphrey to
report to your office immediately.

747
00:54:47.136 --> 00:54:48.763
Bye.

748
00:54:50.473 --> 00:54:51.849

- He said he's driving.

- All right. Berlin.
- Come on, let's go.

758

759

Beautiful. We made it to Berlin.

Bratislava.

763

Dear sweet mother of God.

764
00:57:03.773 --> 00:57:05.983
We're in Eastern Europe.

765
00:57:08.444 --> 00:57:10.071
Ew.

766
00:57:26.212 --> 00:57:27.672
Excuse me.

767

You are Americans?

769
00:57:33.094 --> 00:57:34.137
Yeah.

770
00:57:34.887 --> 00:57:36.097

775
00:57:49.277 --> 00:57:51.404
Do you know if there's a
train coming anytime soon?

776
00:57:51.654 --> 00:57:54.824
Oh, yes, very soon. They
are building it now.

777
00:57:59.036 --> 00:58:01.247
Stop. Hammer time.

778

came in summer.

780

In winter, it can get
very depressing.

781
00:58:10.923 --> 00:58:13.718
We gotta figure something out.
How much money do we have?

What? I got noth... Fine.

785
00:58:33.196 --> 00:58:35.823
A dollar and 83 cents American.

786
00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:37.408
What are we gonna get with that?

787
00:58:43.247 --> 00:58:46.751
Gotta love that exchange rate.

788
00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:54.133

789
00:58:54.508 --> 00:58:56.719

for anything else?

790
00:58:57.386 --> 00:58:59.555

791
00:59:00.431 --> 00:59:02.600
Ah. A nickel.

792
00:59:05.061 --> 00:59:06.562
You see this?

793
00:59:07.688 --> 00:59:09.440
I quit.

794
00:59:10.566 --> 00:59:13.152
I open my own hotel.

795
00:59:21.285 --> 00:59:23.371

- It's Absinthe.

Frommer's says it's
illegal in the States...

818

...because it makes you
hallucinate and go crazy.

819
01:00:45.995 --> 01:00:48.539
They call it "The Green Fairy."

820

in the Aegean.

No, no, no. Wait. You
said you were married?

sleeping with every woman you meet?

832

No, please, Jennifer. It is not like that.
I also sleep with men.

01:02:49.952 --> 01:02:52.413
...and he's the one
who ends up...

859
01:02:52.580 --> 01:02:53.789
Oh, my God.

860
01:02:58.419 --> 01:03:00.921
That is some pretty
fucked-up shit.

861
01:03:13.809 --> 01:03:17.229
They really are the
worst twins ever.

862
01:03:44.548 --> 01:03:47.218
That was a pretty
wild night, eh?

863
01:03:47.968 --> 01:03:50.888
Yep. Pretty wild, pretty wild.

864
01:03:53.224 --> 01:03:55.059
I know I was out of control.

865
01:03:55.226 --> 01:03:56.626
How about you guys?
Did you, uh...?

866
01:03:56.769 --> 01:03:59.688
All right, look. We
were really drunk...

867
01:03:59.855 --> 01:04:02.608
...things got a little
crazy, and Jamie...

868
01:04:02.775 --> 01:04:03.984
...kissed me.

869
01:04:04.985 --> 01:04:06.820
Let's just forget
about it, okay?

870
01:04:06.987 --> 01:04:09.823
Okay, fine. I'll give it a rest.

871
01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:13.180
Jamie, could I borrow
your Frommer's?

872
01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:20.918
Oh, here it is. Bratislava.

873
01:04:21.293 --> 01:04:23.212
Hmm. Capital of Slovakia.

874
01:04:23.671 --> 01:04:25.422
Oh, here's a fun fact.

875
01:04:26.882 --> 01:04:28.801
You made out with
your sister, man.

876
01:04:28.968 --> 01:04:31.262
- Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.
- Like two dogs in heat.

877
01:04:35.683 --> 01:04:38.602
My friends, where is the beef?

878
01:04:40.479 --> 01:04:43.315
You go to Berlin? I'm your ride.

879
01:04:43.482 --> 01:04:45.025
Hop in.

880
01:05:11.510 --> 01:05:14.138
Hey. This is Mieke's
apartment building.

881
01:05:14.930 --> 01:05:17.099
Wish me all sorts of luck, guys.

882
01:05:18.267 --> 01:05:19.560
You'll do great, Scotty.

883
01:05:22.521 --> 01:05:23.772
Thanks.

884
01:05:43.751 --> 01:05:46.211
I came all this way. I'm
not gonna miss this.

885
01:05:53.218 --> 01:05:55.846
- Dude, Mieke's hideous. Run.
- Stop.

886
01:06:08.233 --> 01:06:09.735
Hi, uh, my name is Scott Thomas.

887
01:06:09.902 --> 01:06:12.154
I'm from America and
I'm here to see Mieke.

888
01:06:12.321 --> 01:06:14.531
I'm sorry, but Mieke's not here.

889
01:06:15.074 --> 01:06:18.118
- Do you know where she is?
- She's gone for the summer.

890
01:06:32.966 --> 01:06:35.803
My daughter had intended to
spend the summer in America...

891
01:06:35.969 --> 01:06:38.305
...looking at colleges and
visiting some friends.

892
01:06:38.472 --> 01:06:41.100
But, uh, several days ago, she
suddenly changed her mind.

893
01:06:41.266 --> 01:06:43.602
She would not tell me why.

894
01:06:43.769 --> 01:06:46.188
I think I know why.

895
01:06:51.485 --> 01:06:54.905
Uh, this is Heinrich.
He's Mieke's stepbrother.

896
01:06:55.072 --> 01:06:58.033
As I was saying, she packed
up her bag and left.

897
01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:01.412
- It was all very sudden.
- Do you know where she is now?

898
01:07:01.578 --> 01:07:04.331
As you know, she's always been
very interested in the classics...

899
01:07:04.498 --> 01:07:08.210
...Greek and Roman literature and history,
and she's always enjoyed the ocean...

900
01:07:08.377 --> 01:07:11.588
...so she found a program that
combines all her interests.

901
01:07:11.755 --> 01:07:12.840
Do you know where she is?

902
01:07:13.006 --> 01:07:17.886
Mm. Uh, she enrolled in a
summer-at-sea program, based in Rome.

903
01:07:19.304 --> 01:07:20.973
Rome.

904
01:07:21.140 --> 01:07:23.350
Okay, then I guess we'll
go to Rome, then.

905
01:07:23.517 --> 01:07:26.562
Unfortunately, Mieke's only
in Rome for orientation.

906
01:07:26.729 --> 01:07:29.440
Tomorrow her group boards a boat
and she'll be gone for the summer.

907
01:07:29.606 --> 01:07:33.277
She'll be, uh,
quite unreachable.

908
01:07:34.027 --> 01:07:35.529
Unreachable.

909
01:07:43.203 --> 01:07:45.203
Mieke's tour group goes to
the Vatican tomorrow...

910
01:07:45.330 --> 01:07:47.195
...then she gets on that
boat and she's gone.

911
01:07:47.208 --> 01:07:49.084
So it's over?

912
01:07:50.961 --> 01:07:55.591
Uh, hey. Thanks for sticking with
me through this, guys, but...

913
01:07:55.758 --> 01:08:00.429
...you should probably call your parents,
have them wire you some money and go home.

914
01:08:00.804 --> 01:08:02.681
What are you gonna do?

915
01:08:03.348 --> 01:08:04.808
I'm going to Rome.

916
01:08:06.685 --> 01:08:08.312
I'll Walk, I'll hitchhike...

917
01:08:08.479 --> 01:08:11.190
...I'll swim if I have to, but
I'm gonna get to Mieke somehow.

918
01:08:16.236 --> 01:08:17.529
Maybe that'll help.

919
01:08:17.696 --> 01:08:19.072
Where'd you get all that?

920
01:08:19.698 --> 01:08:21.992
Wait. Where's your Leica?

921
01:08:23.118 --> 01:08:25.621
- Sold it.
- What?

922
01:08:27.039 --> 01:08:29.917
You sold your Leica? But
you loved that thing.

923
01:08:30.083 --> 01:08:32.586
What about your photo tour of Europe?
What about the chateaus?

924
01:08:32.753 --> 01:08:35.380
Chateaus have been
there for 300 years.

925
01:08:35.547 --> 01:08:37.132
Mieke's gone in 12 hours.

926
01:08:40.761 --> 01:08:44.598
Let's go. Frommer's says to check in three
hours before any international flight.

927
01:08:44.765 --> 01:08:46.767
Come here, Guidebook.

928
01:08:46.934 --> 01:08:50.354
Whoo! We're going to Rome.
We're going to Rome!

929
01:09:22.135 --> 01:09:23.804
All right, Summer at Sea group.

930
01:09:23.971 --> 01:09:27.891
Our tour begins in the Vatican Museum.
This way, please.

931
01:09:35.816 --> 01:09:37.192
There it is.

932
01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:46.994
This entrance is for
private tour groups only.

933
01:09:49.371 --> 01:09:51.582
Oh. But we are a
private tour group.

934
01:09:51.748 --> 01:09:54.251
We've come all the
way from America.

935
01:09:56.587 --> 01:09:59.381
That guy in the orange
jacket is mentally retarded.

936
01:10:04.303 --> 01:10:08.932
Si, I can tell. How
very, very sad.

937
01:10:09.141 --> 01:10:10.976
Yes, it is.

938
01:10:11.143 --> 01:10:13.395
But if you are a tour,
where is your guide?

939
01:10:13.562 --> 01:10:15.522
We've got a fantastic
tour guide.

940
01:10:15.689 --> 01:10:18.358
- Right here. Ha, ha.
- What? No.

941
01:10:22.070 --> 01:10:24.489
The Vatican has been used
as a papal residence...

942
01:10:24.656 --> 01:10:26.834
...ever since the time
of Emperor Constantine

943
01:10:26.847 --> 01:10:29.036
the Great of the
5th century A.D.

944
01:10:31.788 --> 01:10:36.293
Oh. Okay, um, if you'll all
follow me, please. Ahem.

945
01:10:39.963 --> 01:10:42.674
Have a very special day...

946
01:10:42.841 --> 01:10:46.970
...for a very
special little man.

947
01:10:47.554 --> 01:10:49.014
Okay.

948
01:10:51.475 --> 01:10:55.228
I can't believe that guy let us in.
What a retard.

949
01:10:55.395 --> 01:10:56.438
Okay, let's find Mieke.

950
01:10:58.649 --> 01:11:01.652
One of our English-speaking
tour guides has called in sick.

951
01:11:01.818 --> 01:11:03.487
Could you please take
these peoples also?

952
01:11:07.032 --> 01:11:10.702
- How big is Vatican City?
- Point-five square kilometers.

953
01:11:10.869 --> 01:11:15.123
- Who built the colonnade?
- Gianlorenzo Bernini, 1656.

954
01:11:15.290 --> 01:11:17.709
- Uh, where are the bathrooms?
- Floors 2, 6 and 7.

955
01:11:17.876 --> 01:11:21.129
Next I'll take you to where the College
of Cardinals elects a new pope.

956
01:11:21.296 --> 01:11:24.716
When this happens, white smoke is sent up
from the Vatican. Here's a fun fact...

957
01:11:24.883 --> 01:11:27.260
Mieke's gotta be
around here somewhere.

958
01:11:27.427 --> 01:11:29.012
Let's go.

959
01:11:37.854 --> 01:11:40.440
<i>Behind me is the
appartamento papale...</i>

960
01:11:40.607 --> 01:11:44.528
...or "papal apartment." We're
obviously not permitted in there.

961
01:11:45.153 --> 01:11:46.989
Excuse me, miss. What is this?

962
01:11:47.155 --> 01:11:49.491
Oh. That is the
Bell of San Marco.

963
01:11:49.658 --> 01:11:51.994
When the pope dies, the
cardinal vicar of Rome...

964
01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:54.788
...rings this Bell to
notify the people of Rome.

965
01:11:54.955 --> 01:11:58.458
Next we will view the Sistine Chapel.
Follow me, please.

966
01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:05.132
Come on. I think I heard them.
Which way did they go?

967
01:12:05.298 --> 01:12:07.676
That way. I'd stake
my reputation on it.

968
01:12:07.843 --> 01:12:09.386
Good enough for me.

969
01:12:09.553 --> 01:12:11.138
Hey, check it out.

970
01:12:12.139 --> 01:12:13.724
I wonder what this does.

971
01:12:13.890 --> 01:12:16.977
It doesn't do anything, it's a rope.
Come on, let's go.

972
01:12:17.144 --> 01:12:19.187
They got a lot of
old stuff here.

973
01:12:28.905 --> 01:12:30.866
The Bell of San Marco.

974
01:12:32.659 --> 01:12:34.619
The pope is dead.

975
01:12:38.832 --> 01:12:40.292
Whoa.

976
01:12:42.794 --> 01:12:44.671
She's not in here.

977
01:12:44.838 --> 01:12:47.049
Let's go. We're definitely
not supposed to be in here.

978
01:12:47.215 --> 01:12:49.468
Hey, check this out.

979
01:12:49.634 --> 01:12:51.845
- I'm the pope.
- Cooper.

980
01:12:52.596 --> 01:12:54.473
Take off the pope hat.

981
01:12:54.639 --> 01:12:58.852
- Oh, no. It's okay. I'm Catholic.
- Cooper, take it off, goddamn it.

982
01:12:59.811 --> 01:13:04.232
Oh, you took the Lord's name in vain.
Only I can forgive you now, my son.

983
01:13:04.399 --> 01:13:08.111
- Take that fudging thing off.
- The pope breaks an open-field tackle.

984
01:13:08.278 --> 01:13:13.366
It's a Hail Mary, he catches at
the 40, the 30, the 20, the 10.

985
01:13:13.533 --> 01:13:15.410
Touchdown, pope!

986
01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:19.414
The pope makes a
two-point conversion.

987
01:13:19.581 --> 01:13:24.795
And oh, my lord. It's the pope,
eight, and the heathens, nothing!

988
01:13:26.421 --> 01:13:28.715
How's you, sucker?

989
01:13:31.301 --> 01:13:32.969
Cooper, the hat. The hat.

990
01:13:33.136 --> 01:13:34.471
The hat is on fire.

991
01:13:34.638 --> 01:13:36.598
<i>We don't need no
water, let the IN...</i>

992
01:13:36.765 --> 01:13:38.975
I'm not kidding. Look.

993
01:13:39.142 --> 01:13:40.477
Oh, holy shit.

994
01:13:41.186 --> 01:13:42.938
- Ooh!
- I don't want this.

995
01:13:43.105 --> 01:13:45.148
Fireplace. Fireplace. Go, go.

996
01:13:47.192 --> 01:13:48.693
Whoa.

997
01:13:56.493 --> 01:13:58.036
White smoke.

998
01:13:58.203 --> 01:14:01.623
They've elected the new pope!

999
01:14:04.042 --> 01:14:06.169
I'm coming to you live
from Vatican Square...

1000
01:14:06.336 --> 01:14:08.797
...where the College of
Cardinals, in a surprise move...

1001
01:14:08.964 --> 01:14:13.426
<i>...has just elected a new pope.
The crowd is very, very excited.</i>

1002
01:14:13.593 --> 01:14:15.679
This is so strange.

1003
01:14:15.846 --> 01:14:19.182
Usually they wait 15 days
to elect a new pope.

1004
01:14:19.349 --> 01:14:21.434
We could be seeing
history in the making.

1005
01:14:21.601 --> 01:14:23.937
We could be seeing an
arrest in the making.

1006
01:14:31.653 --> 01:14:34.239
There she is. Mieke.

1007
01:14:37.033 --> 01:14:39.327
Hey. Stupid curtain. Unh.

1008
01:14:39.619 --> 01:14:41.496
Let me out.

1009
01:14:44.791 --> 01:14:46.793
Mieke!

1010
01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:49.296
It's the new pope!

1011
01:15:15.822 --> 01:15:17.449
What the hell?

1012
01:15:23.079 --> 01:15:24.372
Mieke.

1013
01:15:27.292 --> 01:15:28.627
Hold on.

1014
01:15:34.591 --> 01:15:36.843
This is one crazy pope.

1015
01:15:46.519 --> 01:15:50.482
You. Ferma. Stop. You.

1016
01:15:52.025 --> 01:15:56.404
You and your retarded friend...

1017
01:15:56.571 --> 01:15:58.198
...you're in big, big trouble.

1018
01:15:58.365 --> 01:15:59.407
Oy.

1019
01:16:02.494 --> 01:16:04.829
Take your mitts off them boys.

1020
01:16:04.996 --> 01:16:07.040
They're with me.

1021
01:16:09.167 --> 01:16:12.128
I've just about had enough
of you fucking Ities.

1022
01:16:13.588 --> 01:16:15.340
But I am Swiss.

1023
01:16:15.757 --> 01:16:17.550
Them too.

1024
01:16:23.515 --> 01:16:28.645
Now, bud, you get in there, and
you say what you got to say.

1025
01:16:29.813 --> 01:16:32.607
Mieke. I'm here. I made it.

1026
01:16:36.152 --> 01:16:37.696
Who are you?

1027
01:16:41.866 --> 01:16:45.203
What a fucking loser. I'm
gonna videotape this.

1028
01:16:46.997 --> 01:16:48.873
I'm Scott.

1029
01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:50.417
From Ohio?

1030
01:16:50.583 --> 01:16:54.129
Scott? Scott Thomas?

1031
01:16:54.296 --> 01:16:57.799
- Yes.
- From Ohio?

1032
01:16:57.966 --> 01:17:00.927
- What are you doing in Rome?
- I came here to be with you.

1033
01:17:01.303 --> 01:17:03.513
Listen, I just traveled all
the way across Europe.

1034
01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:06.182
I got chased by naked men.

1035
01:17:06.349 --> 01:17:09.811
I ate brownies with
absolutely no drugs in them.

1036
01:17:10.395 --> 01:17:12.731
I watched a brother
and sister make out.

1037
01:17:14.024 --> 01:17:18.069
I kicked a robot in the balls,
but I did it all so that...

1038
01:17:18.236 --> 01:17:20.238
So I could tell you one thing.

1039
01:17:23.283 --> 01:17:24.993
I love you, Mieke.

1040
01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:26.244
Aw.

1041
01:17:27.704 --> 01:17:30.332
We're perfect for each other.
What do you think?

1042
01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.293
I think...

1043
01:17:48.641 --> 01:17:51.061
Oh, Mieke... Mieke.

1044
01:18:04.866 --> 01:18:07.369
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

1045
01:18:07.535 --> 01:18:09.371
I have cheated on my husband.

1046
01:18:09.537 --> 01:18:11.748
Do you think God will
ever forgive me?

1047
01:18:11.915 --> 01:18:13.708
Oh, yes.

1048
01:18:13.875 --> 01:18:16.669
Father?

1049
01:18:17.462 --> 01:18:20.924
Father! Aah!

1050
01:18:27.222 --> 01:18:28.723
This sucks.

1051
01:18:28.890 --> 01:18:31.976
I can't believe I'm the only one who
didn't hook up while we were here.

1052
01:18:32.143 --> 01:18:34.938
Europe is officially the
worst country on earth.

1053
01:18:35.522 --> 01:18:36.564
I know.

1054
01:18:36.731 --> 01:18:40.110
I thought I'd at least get to
have some crazy European sex.

1055
01:18:43.947 --> 01:18:45.448
What?

1056
01:18:54.082 --> 01:18:56.835
- Scott, I have to go.
- Okay.

1057
01:18:57.001 --> 01:18:59.129
My boat is leaving.

1058
01:19:00.171 --> 01:19:03.842
I still can't believe you came
all the way here, just for me.

1059
01:19:04.008 --> 01:19:07.137
What can I say? I'm
very unpredictable.

1060
01:19:08.263 --> 01:19:09.889
Keep writing to me, Scott, okay?

1061
01:19:10.056 --> 01:19:11.766
Yeah, I will.

1062
01:19:20.775 --> 01:19:22.444
- Go.
- Bye.

1063
01:19:30.618 --> 01:19:32.579
Yes. Yes. Yes.

1064
01:19:32.745 --> 01:19:34.122
<i>Woo-had.!</i>

1065
01:19:35.748 --> 01:19:39.169
Hey, guys, I'm so glad we got
to take this trip together.

1066
01:19:39.335 --> 01:19:41.588
This was the best
time of my life.

1067
01:19:45.633 --> 01:19:47.177
Excuse me.

1068
01:19:47.343 --> 01:19:50.680
You're the young man who gave me that
tour of the Vatican, aren't you?

1069
01:19:53.308 --> 01:19:56.269
- Listen, I'm very sorry...
- I just wanted to thank you.

1070
01:19:56.436 --> 01:19:59.814
You were the most knowledgeable,
albeit idiosyncratic...

1071
01:19:59.981 --> 01:20:01.566
...tour guide I've ever had.

1072
01:20:01.733 --> 01:20:05.862
Ha, ha. Thanks. But I'm not
actually a tour guide.

1073
01:20:06.029 --> 01:20:08.573
Um, I've just read Frommer's
enough to have it memorized.

1074
01:20:08.740 --> 01:20:11.451
Although, I threw in a few things
Frommer's didn't know about.

1075
01:20:11.618 --> 01:20:13.369
How would you like to add them?

1076
01:20:13.995 --> 01:20:15.497
Excuse me?

1077
01:20:15.663 --> 01:20:17.874
That's my guidebook.

1078
01:20:23.421 --> 01:20:24.839
I'm Arthur Frommer.

1079
01:20:27.258 --> 01:20:30.416
It's amazing. Frommer's
is going to pay me

1080
01:20:30.429 --> 01:20:33.598
to see every museum and
cathedral in Europe.

1081
01:20:33.765 --> 01:20:36.684
- Ha, ha.
- That sounds so exciting...

1082
01:20:36.851 --> 01:20:39.437
...for you.

1083
01:20:39.604 --> 01:20:41.445
I figured, since you're
going to be staying...

1084
01:20:41.606 --> 01:20:43.316
...you might need this.

1085
01:20:44.776 --> 01:20:46.778
- A disposable camera.
- That's right.

1086
01:20:46.945 --> 01:20:49.614
- Thanks, Scotty.
- That's from both of us.

1087
01:20:52.408 --> 01:20:54.702
<i>Scotty doesn't know

1088
01:20:54.869 --> 01:20:57.914
<i>Scotty doesn't know
Don't tell Scotty.</i>

1089
01:20:58.081 --> 01:21:01.251
Hello, Mr. Walters. I see.

1090
01:21:01.876 --> 01:21:03.920
Fired? Well, I...

1091
01:21:04.379 --> 01:21:07.924
Well, if that's what you want,
I understand. I just...

1092
01:21:08.716 --> 01:21:10.760
Goodbye, sir.

1093
01:21:10.927 --> 01:21:12.528
They had to catch you
eventually, right?

1094
01:21:12.679 --> 01:21:14.764
- No, they fired Humphrey.
- Shut up.

1095
01:21:14.931 --> 01:21:16.182
I got his office and a raise.

1096
01:21:16.349 --> 01:21:17.767
- No.
- Ha, ha.

1097
01:21:17.934 --> 01:21:21.354
Flight 341 from Rome
to Cleveland...

1098
01:21:21.521 --> 01:21:22.814
- That's you guys.
- Yeah.

1099
01:21:22.981 --> 01:21:24.816
- Have a good flight, everybody.
- Come here.

1100
01:21:28.361 --> 01:21:29.737
Be good.

1101
01:21:31.072 --> 01:21:32.323
Oh. Okay.

1102
01:21:34.409 --> 01:21:35.952
- Have a good flight.
- Be good.

1103
01:21:36.119 --> 01:21:37.370
Thanks.

1104
01:22:10.612 --> 01:22:11.946
I'm on it.

1105
01:22:18.953 --> 01:22:20.246
Whoa!

1106
01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:24.584
This still counts
as Europe, right?

1107
01:22:33.134 --> 01:22:34.552
<i>Scott ". " Dear Mieke.</i>

1108
01:22:34.719 --> 01:22:37.221
<i>Greece sounds incredible.</i>

1109
01:22:37.388 --> 01:22:39.515
<i>I just moved into my
dorm room today...</i>

1110
01:22:39.682 --> 01:22:42.477
<i>...but I can't wait to see
you over Christmas break.</i>

1111
01:22:42.644 --> 01:22:45.188
<i>"This time I think I'll
fly to Berlin direct."</i>

1112
01:22:51.819 --> 01:22:54.155
- Hello?
- Hey, buddy, how's college?

1113
01:22:54.322 --> 01:22:57.241
<i>Hey, I just got here. My roommate
hasn't even showed up yet.</i>

1114
01:22:57.408 --> 01:22:59.619
Do they room all you
pre-med geeks together?

1115
01:22:59.869 --> 01:23:01.537
I'm not sure I'm going pre-med.

1116
01:23:01.704 --> 01:23:03.748
I'm thinking about
majoring in German.

1117
01:23:03.915 --> 01:23:05.476
<i>Cooper'. German? I've
got a better idea.</i>

1118
01:23:05.625 --> 01:23:07.877
Why don't you major in
"Not Being Such a Woman"?

1119
01:23:08.294 --> 01:23:09.545
So how's Jenny?

1120
01:23:09.712 --> 01:23:12.090
Jenny...? Jenny who?

1121
01:23:12.256 --> 01:23:14.342
I know a lot of ladies named
Jenny, they're all...

1122
01:23:14.509 --> 01:23:16.302
Ow.

1123
01:23:17.553 --> 01:23:18.971
Hey, Scotty, what's up?

1124
01:23:19.138 --> 01:23:20.264
Hi, Jenny.

1125
01:23:20.431 --> 01:23:22.767
<i>Have you heard from Jamie?
How's he doing with Frommer?</i>

1126
01:23:22.934 --> 01:23:24.310
Oh, no.

1127
01:23:28.398 --> 01:23:29.816
Hold on.

1128
01:23:30.650 --> 01:23:33.986
- Come here, robot.
- Cooper, not again.

1129
01:23:35.446 --> 01:23:37.699
Hold on, this should
be my new roommate.

1130
01:23:43.871 --> 01:23:45.623
<i>"Cooper". What's the
freak look like?</i>

1131
01:23:45.790 --> 01:23:49.127
Is he a dork or is he cool?
Better not be cooler than me.

1132
01:23:49.585 --> 01:23:51.295
<i>Is he bigger than me?</i>

1133
01:23:51.462 --> 01:23:54.215
I just got your last e-mail.
What are you doing here?

1134
01:23:54.924 --> 01:23:56.384
Going to college.

1135
01:23:57.468 --> 01:23:58.803
You're going to college here?

1136
01:24:00.555 --> 01:24:02.223
- What dorm?
- This one.

1137
01:24:02.557 --> 01:24:04.559
Room 214.

1138
01:24:08.146 --> 01:24:09.731
How is this possible?

1139
01:24:10.857 --> 01:24:13.109
I guess they thought
I was a guy.

1140
01:24:13.818 --> 01:24:17.029
Now who would be dumb enough
to make a mistake like that?

1141
01:24:25.955 --> 01:24:27.957
<i>"Cooper". Do I hear kissing?</i>

1142
01:24:28.124 --> 01:24:30.543
<i>Are you making out with
your new roommate, Scotty?</i>

1143
01:24:34.172 --> 01:24:35.548
<i>Scotty?</i>

1144
01:24:35.715 --> 01:24:38.384
<i>Scotty? Scotty.</i>

1145
01:24:41.304 --> 01:24:43.473
This happy ending is bullshit.

1146
01:24:43.639 --> 01:24:47.268
When does the fairy get laid?
I'm out of here.

1147
01:24:54.484 --> 01:24:57.111
- Catchy tune.
- Fucking-A, man.

1148
01:24:57.278 --> 01:25:00.323
<i>Scotty doesn't know
So don't tell Scotty.</i>

1149

<i>Fiona says she's out shoppin'.</i>

1150
01:25:05.620 --> 01:25:10.124
<i>But she's under me And

1153
01:25:16.088 --> 01:25:21.594
Hello, and welcome to Amsterdam's
finest and most luxurious youth hostel.

1154
01:25:22.386 --> 01:25:23.554
Sounds great.

1155
01:25:23.721 --> 01:25:25.932
There is no bathroom, nor
is there one nearby.

1156
01:25:31.395 --> 01:25:33.147
Ha, ha. Sorry.

1157
01:25:36.526 --> 01:25:38.402
- Get it?
- She got it.

1158
01:25:38.569 --> 01:25:41.906
If you do not wish to have
your valuables stolen...

1159
01:25:42.073 --> 01:25:45.785
...I suggest destroying them
or discarding them right now.

1160
01:25:45.952 --> 01:25:49.539
You can also try hiding
your valuables...

1161
01:25:49.705 --> 01:25:51.541
...in your anus.

1162
01:25:51.707 --> 01:25:53.000
Drink?

1163
01:25:58.005 --> 01:26:00.716
I'm gonna rip away his pants
and look at his dick, okay?

1164
01:26:00.883 --> 01:26:02.802
- Ha, ha.
- Ready? Quit. Shut up.

1165
01:26:02.969 --> 01:26:05.471
Sorry. I know I fucked it up.
I fucked it up.

1166
01:26:05.638 --> 01:26:11.185
Yes. You take her hair, and one
strand at a time, pull it out.

1167
01:26:11.519 --> 01:26:13.980
Use her like a humping post.

1168
01:26:14.689 --> 01:26:15.982
Jenny, this is Europe.

1169
01:26:16.148 --> 01:26:19.318
They have orange juice ads
with lesbians and dildos.

1170
01:26:20.194 --> 01:26:22.446
<i>Happy Juice. Hee-hee.</i>

1171
01:26:23.489 --> 01:26:26.158
You gotta show them something
they haven't seen before.

1172
01:26:31.914 --> 01:26:34.750
Oh, no! Ha, ha.

Should a fire occur, due
to our faulty wiring...

1175
01:26:45.261 --> 01:26:50.057
...or the fireworks factory upstairs,
you will be incinerated...

1176
01:26:50.224 --> 01:26:53.185
...along with the valuables
you have hidden in your anus.

01:27:29.639 --> 01:27:31.140
You fucking beep?

1183
01:27:31.307 --> 01:27:34.143
We'll beep, you bastard, all
over your fucking nose!

1184
01:27:34.310 --> 01:27:37.647
Fuck off! Go on, you
French bastards!

1185
01:27:37.813 --> 01:27:40.399
Get on the other side of
the road, you pricks!

1186
01:27:40.566 --> 01:27:42.151

01:27:43.736 --> 01:27:45.237
