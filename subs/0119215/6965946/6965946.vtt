00:08:44.025 --> 00:08:45.527
Like summer vacation.

181
00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:49.197
The key word there is "vacation."

182
00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.949
See what I'm saying?

183
00:08:51.032 --> 00:08:52.450
[tires squealing]

184
00:08:55.286 --> 00:08:57.163

<i>♪ She 's a dude, 'cause we 're all dudes ♪</i>

186
00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.752
<i>♪ Hey, I'm a dude, he 's a dude... ♪</i>

187
00:09:06.089 --> 00:09:08.299

'Cause we're all dudes ♪</i>

189
00:09:11.094 --> 00:09:12.387
- Look out!
- Whoa!

[tires squealing]

191
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:18.017
Dude, get off the...

192
00:09:22.188 --> 00:09:23.898
[muffled shouting]

193
00:09:28.862 --> 00:09:30.196
My Afro.

194
00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.489
My Afro!

195
00:09:34.784 --> 00:09:35.827
Why?

196
00:09:36.411 --> 00:09:38.997
Oh, brother Reed.

197
00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.623
You have messed up my Afro.

198
00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:44.210
All right, don't worry, bro.

199
00:09:44.294 --> 00:09:46.463
Just be cool, and let me handle this.

200
00:09:46.546 --> 00:09:47.672
All right, Jake?

201
00:09:48.757 --> 00:09:49.799
Jake?

202
00:09:49.883 --> 00:09:52.218
- Jake!
- [teacher] No!

203
00:09:52.302 --> 00:09:53.720
Oh, no.

204
00:09:54.345 --> 00:09:56.139
Oh, baby. Oh!

205
00:09:56.723 --> 00:09:58.099
Oh, no.

206
00:09:58.183 --> 00:10:00.351
Oh! Oh, my grill.

207
00:10:00.435 --> 00:10:03.146
Oh, Black Beauty, oh. Oh!

208
00:10:03.229 --> 00:10:04.230
Oh!

209
00:10:04.314 --> 00:10:07.334
When I left school today, I didn't think
I was going to run into you this summer.

210
00:10:07.358 --> 00:10:09.360
Or I didn't think
you was going to run into me!

211
00:10:09.444 --> 00:10:12.489
I mean, just run into me like this.
You're in trouble with me, young man.

212
00:10:12.572 --> 00:10:14.967
- You're in trouble with me!
- No, listen, Mr. Wheat, listen.

213
00:10:14.991 --> 00:10:15.992
It wasn't my fault.

214
00:10:16.075 --> 00:10:19.329
See, this nut on some roller blades,
he skated into my vision sight.

215
00:10:19.412 --> 00:10:21.693
- I couldn't see nothing, so I swerved...
- Roller blades?

216
00:10:21.748 --> 00:10:24.143
- We was spinning around like that...
- I don't want to hear it!

217
00:10:24.167 --> 00:10:26.961
- And then I couldn't control it...
- I don't want to hear it!

218
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:29.631
- Know how much that car cost me?
- No.

219
00:10:29.714 --> 00:10:30.715
- Do you know?
- No.

220
00:10:30.799 --> 00:10:32.342
That's a $22,000 car.

221
00:10:32.425 --> 00:10:33.760
$22,000!

222
00:10:33.843 --> 00:10:35.220
And that's just the base price!

223
00:10:35.303 --> 00:10:37.931
Check out the chrome, see?
I waited four weeks for the chrome!

224
00:10:38.014 --> 00:10:40.058
You can't get chrome wheels at base price!

225
00:10:40.141 --> 00:10:41.351
See that leather?

226
00:10:41.434 --> 00:10:43.394
That's Detroit leather.
That's Detroit leather.

227
00:10:43.478 --> 00:10:46.105
You got to order Detroit leather
from Detroit!

228
00:10:46.189 --> 00:10:48.066
Huh? What's that tell you?

229
00:10:48.817 --> 00:10:51.152
They always get you
with them extras. [laughs]

230
00:10:53.363 --> 00:10:55.031
Give me your driver's license.

231
00:10:55.782 --> 00:10:59.661
- Um... Regarding my driver's license...
- Give me your driver's license.

232
00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:02.956
I'd give it to you,
but you're going to have to wait.

233
00:11:03.039 --> 00:11:04.415
For what?

234
00:11:04.499 --> 00:11:06.292
- Oh, about a year.
- Oh, no.

235
00:11:06.376 --> 00:11:08.002
- That... that's when I get one.
- No.

236
00:11:08.086 --> 00:11:09.646
- When they put it in my hand.
- No, no.

237
00:11:09.671 --> 00:11:11.273
- You don't have a driver's license?
- No.

238
00:11:11.297 --> 00:11:13.216
I know you don't have no insurance,
do you?

239
00:11:13.299 --> 00:11:15.051
I guess... I hate to do this, young man.

240
00:11:15.134 --> 00:11:17.762
I hate to put a Black man in jail,
but I'm gonna call the police.

241
00:11:17.846 --> 00:11:20.306
Black man in jail?
You ain't got the... I'm just a kid.

242
00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:23.017
No, no, no, not the police.
Don't call the police.

243
00:11:23.101 --> 00:11:25.854
No, please, don't call them.
Please, don't call the police!

244
00:11:25.937 --> 00:11:28.497
They can't find out I was driving
without a license, sir, please.

245
00:11:28.565 --> 00:11:31.609
No, please, let me fix it.
Just let me, let me fix it, please.

246
00:11:31.693 --> 00:11:34.454
- You shouldn't have been driving.
- No, let me fix it. Let me fix it!

247
00:11:35.947 --> 00:11:37.824
- All right.
- All right?

248
00:11:37.907 --> 00:11:39.367
Yeah, all right. Yeah.

249
00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:41.286
Yeah, I'll let you fix the car.

250
00:11:41.369 --> 00:11:44.455
So, uh, how much you think
it's going to cost to fix?

251
00:11:45.123 --> 00:11:47.417
[workers chattering]

252
00:11:48.543 --> 00:11:50.587
$1,900?

253
00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:52.297
I don't have $1,900.

254
00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:55.317
That's all right. Maybe your parents will
help you out. I'll give them a call.

255
00:11:55.341 --> 00:11:57.260
Ooh, oh, um, wait.

256
00:11:57.343 --> 00:11:59.223
- I'll get the money.
- You can't get the money.

257
00:11:59.304 --> 00:12:01.740
I know you got a summer,
you want to be free. We'll just call...

258
00:12:01.764 --> 00:12:03.683
No, wait, wait, wait, wait.

259
00:12:03.766 --> 00:12:06.102
I will... I'll...

260
00:12:06.686 --> 00:12:09.647
- I'll...
- I'll... I'll...

261
00:12:10.899 --> 00:12:12.400
I'll...

262
00:12:12.483 --> 00:12:15.194
I'll get a summerjob.

263
00:12:19.407 --> 00:12:24.037
[man] Bun, patty,
topping, sauce, assemble.

264
00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:29.167
Bun, patty, topping, sauce, assemble.

265
00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:34.172
Bun, patty, topping, sauce, assemble...

266
00:12:36.674 --> 00:12:39.510
Come... Come here, little bun.
Oh, beef patty.

267
00:12:41.346 --> 00:12:43.306
All right, yeah, yeah. Okay.

268
00:12:43.389 --> 00:12:46.017
[grunting]

269
00:12:47.018 --> 00:12:49.354
Okay, yeah. Ooh, that's nasty. All right.

270
00:12:49.437 --> 00:12:51.064
Yo, my man, can I borrow some lettuce?

271
00:12:51.898 --> 00:12:53.858
- Huh? Can I borrow some...
- [whistle blows]

272
00:12:53.942 --> 00:12:54.943
- You.
- Who?

273
00:12:55.026 --> 00:12:56.611
You! Look at this mess.

274
00:12:57.236 --> 00:12:58.571
I... I can explain.

275
00:12:58.655 --> 00:13:01.282
See, I was trying to put
the big old beef patty... Oh!

276
00:13:01.366 --> 00:13:03.159
On the bottom half
of the bun, you know,

277
00:13:03.242 --> 00:13:06.079
before the tomato
gets all slippery with the...

278
00:13:06.162 --> 00:13:07.413
Ooh, that's slippery.

279
00:13:07.497 --> 00:13:09.207
Oh, I'm sorry. And then, you know,

280
00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:11.209
the pickle bits was making me
do them wrong,

281
00:13:11.292 --> 00:13:14.170
because they're, they're flexible,
they're not crunchy.

282
00:13:14.253 --> 00:13:15.380
And...

283
00:13:15.463 --> 00:13:17.006
Yo, man, back me up on this.

284
00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:19.801
- [whistle blows]
- Oh, again with the whistle.

285
00:13:19.884 --> 00:13:21.719
Shut up. Just be quiet.

286
00:13:21.803 --> 00:13:25.014
It'd be a lot more quiet
if you stopped blowing the whistle.

287
00:13:25.098 --> 00:13:27.308
Watch your mouth,
you pestiferous little maggot.

288
00:13:27.392 --> 00:13:30.353
Now, I'm familiar with the term "maggot,"

289
00:13:30.436 --> 00:13:32.355
but... "pestiferous"?

290
00:13:32.438 --> 00:13:35.608
Burn this into the front row
of your brain, chuckles.

291
00:13:35.692 --> 00:13:38.111
If there's one thing Kurt cannot stand,

292
00:13:38.194 --> 00:13:40.780
it is an incompetent, bumbling, sloppy,

293
00:13:40.863 --> 00:13:42.991
fast-food employee.

294
00:13:47.537 --> 00:13:49.372
Yum. Huh.

295
00:13:50.373 --> 00:13:51.666
Ed!

296
00:13:51.749 --> 00:13:53.668
What are you doing inside
the milkshake machine?

297
00:13:53.751 --> 00:13:56.129
Oh, trying to fix it.

298
00:13:56.212 --> 00:13:58.172
Did you turn on the switch?

299
00:13:58.798 --> 00:13:59.966
Oh.

300
00:14:00.049 --> 00:14:02.218
- [clicks]
- [whirring]

301
00:14:03.469 --> 00:14:04.721
Ah.

302
00:14:04.804 --> 00:14:07.306
Whoo! Whoa!

303
00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:09.642
Yeah!

304
00:14:09.726 --> 00:14:11.269
Strawberry Jacuzzi.

305
00:14:11.352 --> 00:14:13.813
[babbling]

306
00:14:16.649 --> 00:14:19.444
People, I'm fully stoked

307
00:14:19.527 --> 00:14:22.321
about being in charge
of every single one of you.

308
00:14:23.197 --> 00:14:25.158
Within two years,

309
00:14:25.241 --> 00:14:30.038
Mondo Burger's going to be
the biggest burger chain on this planet.

310
00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:32.081
Oh, yeah.

311
00:14:32.165 --> 00:14:35.668
First, we gotta beat out
our big competition across the street,

312
00:14:35.752 --> 00:14:38.880
- Good Burger.
- [both laughing]

313
00:14:41.257 --> 00:14:42.341
From now on,

314
00:14:42.967 --> 00:14:46.012
your life is Mondo Burger.

315
00:14:46.721 --> 00:14:48.598
You can forget about your friends.

316
00:14:48.681 --> 00:14:50.975
You can forget about your family.

317
00:14:52.226 --> 00:14:56.856
Because Kurt is now
both your mother and your father.

318
00:14:58.483 --> 00:15:01.652
Kurt must look awfully strange naked.
[snickering]

319
00:15:02.737 --> 00:15:05.281
Who said that?
Who talked while Kurt was talking?

320
00:15:05.364 --> 00:15:07.825
It was him. He uttered something.

321
00:15:10.453 --> 00:15:11.621
Why, I should've known.

322
00:15:11.704 --> 00:15:13.539
Oh, I'm sorry I uttered.

323
00:15:14.373 --> 00:15:16.250
You think you're funny, don't you, bro?

324
00:15:17.085 --> 00:15:20.713
You know what?
At Mondo Burger, there are no comedians.

325
00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:24.634
You mess with Kurt,
and you go into the grinder.

326
00:15:24.717 --> 00:15:26.511
Okay, now this grinder of yours,

327
00:15:26.594 --> 00:15:29.430
is it a real grinder,
or is it some kind of a metaphor?

328
00:15:29.514 --> 00:15:30.890
That's it. You're gone!

329
00:15:30.973 --> 00:15:33.351
Adios, TKO, historical.

330
00:15:33.434 --> 00:15:35.728
Wait, wait, wait.
I... I won't be funny no more. See?

331
00:15:35.812 --> 00:15:38.564
- Security!
- You ain't got to bring the man down here.

332
00:15:38.648 --> 00:15:41.067
Wait a second.
Kurt, come on, please. I need this job.

333
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:42.276
Take out the trash.

334
00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:44.654
Trash? Oh, now, look here, p...

335
00:15:44.737 --> 00:15:46.405
Get this loser out of my face!

336
00:15:46.489 --> 00:15:48.741
Loser? Now you about to push me
a little too far.

337
00:15:48.825 --> 00:15:51.577
- You want a piece of me?
- Yeah, extra crispy, please.

338
00:15:51.661 --> 00:15:54.413
Oh, see, you lucky you brought
your friends down here.

339
00:15:54.497 --> 00:15:57.792
Hey, man, is this really necessary?
Kurt, please! I need this job!

340
00:15:57.875 --> 00:16:01.170
[whimpering]
Please, I need this job. Please.

341
00:16:01.254 --> 00:16:02.630
Excuse me.

342
00:16:02.713 --> 00:16:05.466
Look, I ordered one Good Burger
with nothing on it.

343
00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:06.926
That's what I gave you.

344
00:16:07.009 --> 00:16:08.845
No, you gave me a bun.

345
00:16:08.928 --> 00:16:10.471
Just a bun.

346
00:16:10.555 --> 00:16:12.306
Look, there's no meat in here.

347
00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:14.267
But you said you wanted nothing on it.

348
00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:16.602
Yes, well, I expected a meat patty!

349
00:16:16.686 --> 00:16:20.314
Dude, a meat patty is something.

I've never seen so many customers.

- Oh, back in business.

717
00:33:35.932 --> 00:33:38.852
- Move over, Mondo Burger.
- Move over. [laughs]

718
00:33:38.935 --> 00:33:39.936
- And, Ed?
- What?

719
00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:41.479
For every Good Burger we sell,

720
00:33:41.563 --> 00:33:44.107
I'm going to give you ten cents
for every one!

721
00:33:44.191 --> 00:33:46.026

- Oh, okay, be right there.

723
00:33:48.612 --> 00:33:52.115
No, no, no. I'll help Deedee. You get
in that kitchen and keep making sauce.

Well, Ed, how's that sauce-making
coming along?

727
00:34:04.211 --> 00:34:06.922
Oh, pretty good. Mr. Baily says
it's going to save Good Burger.

728
00:34:07.005 --> 00:34:08.089
That's great.

729
00:34:08.173 --> 00:34:10.926
Now, you do remember that it was my idea

730
00:34:11.009 --> 00:34:13.595
to put the sauce on Good Burgers
in the first place, right?

731
00:34:13.678 --> 00:34:15.805
Yeah, you should get
some of the money I receive.

732
00:34:17.015 --> 00:34:18.391
I'm glad to hear you say that.

733
00:34:18.475 --> 00:34:20.810
In fact, since we're going to be
in business together,

734
00:34:20.894 --> 00:34:23.146
I thought that maybe
we should sign a little contract,

735
00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:25.774
just to make our partnership "official."

736
00:34:26.441 --> 00:34:27.734
Yeah, okay.

737
00:34:29.653 --> 00:34:30.654
Mm.

738
00:34:31.321 --> 00:34:32.447
Mm-hmm.

739
00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:33.573
Mm... hmm.

740
00:34:33.657 --> 00:34:35.033
Oh, oh, yeah.

741
00:34:35.116 --> 00:34:36.451
Mm, mm.

742
00:34:37.077 --> 00:34:38.078
Mm.

743
00:34:38.161 --> 00:34:39.788
I know some of these words.

744
00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:43.458
Ah. So, what does it all mean, Dexter?

745
00:34:43.541 --> 00:34:45.710
Well, it's... it's quite simple, really.

746
00:34:45.794 --> 00:34:48.505
Of all the money that Good Burger makes
off your sauce,

747
00:34:48.588 --> 00:34:50.799
you get to keep 20%.

748
00:34:50.882 --> 00:34:51.925
Cool? Okay.

749
00:34:52.008 --> 00:34:53.927
And then I'll keep the other 80%,

750
00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:56.137
so it works out cool for both of us.

751
00:34:56.721 --> 00:34:57.889
Okay.

752
00:35:00.183 --> 00:35:02.560
- There you go.
- Cool. All right.

753
00:35:02.644 --> 00:35:04.020
[Deedee] Ed!

754
00:35:04.104 --> 00:35:05.981
There must be 50 customers out there.

755
00:35:06.064 --> 00:35:07.399
It's unbelievable.

756
00:35:07.482 --> 00:35:08.942
What do you put in that sauce?

757
00:35:09.025 --> 00:35:11.903
Well, you start off with a little
lemon juice and some ketchup...

758
00:35:11.987 --> 00:35:13.905
[groaning]

759
00:35:13.989 --> 00:35:15.782
[coughing]

760
00:35:15.865 --> 00:35:18.743
Um, look, Dexter, I like you
as a friend and all, but it might...

761
00:35:18.827 --> 00:35:20.537
- No. Listen to me carefully.
- Okay.

762
00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:22.998
Do not tell anyone
the recipe to your sauce.

763
00:35:23.081 --> 00:35:25.125
First, you start off
with a little lemon juice...

764
00:35:25.208 --> 00:35:28.128
- Stop it! Stop talking!
- Oh.

765
00:35:28.211 --> 00:35:32.257
Never tell anyone
the ingredients of your sauce.

766
00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:33.633
Why?

767
00:35:33.717 --> 00:35:35.510
You want to save Good Burger, don't you?

768
00:35:35.593 --> 00:35:37.345
Oh, yeah. Good Burger's my life.

769
00:35:37.429 --> 00:35:40.724
Well, then, you gotta keep
your sauce recipe a secret.

770
00:35:40.807 --> 00:35:41.975
- All right?
- Okay.

771
00:35:42.058 --> 00:35:43.643
- All right.
- Um, Dexter?

772
00:35:43.727 --> 00:35:45.729
- Hmm?
- You're squishing my pancreas.

773
00:35:47.939 --> 00:35:49.816
- Sorry.
- Thanks.

774
00:35:58.658 --> 00:35:59.993
Unbelievable.

775
00:36:00.076 --> 00:36:02.662
Two days ago, we had Good Burger crushed.

776
00:36:02.746 --> 00:36:04.164
Now look at 'em.

777
00:36:04.247 --> 00:36:05.623
I think it's the sauce, boss.

778
00:36:06.624 --> 00:36:07.834
Oh.

779
00:36:09.586 --> 00:36:11.921
- [grunts]
- Duh. I know that.

780
00:36:13.381 --> 00:36:15.050
You think Kurt's stupid?

781
00:36:15.133 --> 00:36:16.843
Mm... Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.

782
00:36:18.803 --> 00:36:19.804
[sighs]

783
00:36:20.722 --> 00:36:22.682
I want Good Burger out of business.

784
00:36:22.766 --> 00:36:24.184
Go find out what's in that sauce.

785
00:36:24.267 --> 00:36:26.227
I'll go get some and have it checked out.

786
00:36:26.311 --> 00:36:27.312
[grunts]

787
00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:32.901

788
00:36:33.818 --> 00:36:36.112
Ed, here's your take for the day.

789
00:36:36.196 --> 00:36:39.240
- Sixty-seven dollars.
- Yay!

790
00:36:39.324 --> 00:36:41.034
- Yay!
- [both laugh]

791
00:36:41.117 --> 00:36:42.702
Thanks for the sauce, kid.

792
00:36:42.786 --> 00:36:44.037
[gasping] Mm!

793
00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:45.163
Love ya!

794
00:36:45.246 --> 00:36:46.456
[laughing]

795
00:36:46.539 --> 00:36:47.957
[laughs] Whoa!

796
00:36:48.958 --> 00:36:50.460
Well, here you go, Ed.

797
00:36:50.543 --> 00:36:52.712
You get to keep $13.

798
00:36:52.796 --> 00:36:55.340
Whoa. That's almost $14.

799
00:36:55.423 --> 00:36:57.217
Yeah, well, see you tomorrow.

800
00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:01.012
Uh, hey, hey, Dex, uh, what you doing?
You want to hang out or something?

801
00:37:01.096 --> 00:37:04.599
Uh, gee, I don't know.
I gotta go clean my room.

802
00:37:04.682 --> 00:37:07.227
- I... I gotta...
- Please?

803
00:37:09.729 --> 00:37:11.773
- Sure. Let... Let's hang out.
- Cool!

804
00:37:12.774 --> 00:37:14.234
Want to see my secret place?

805
00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:16.820
That's not what I had in mind.

806
00:37:17.529 --> 00:37:19.739
- Come on!
- All... All right. I get you.

807
00:37:22.784 --> 00:37:24.244
This is my place.

808
00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:27.539
This is where I come to think.

809
00:37:28.039 --> 00:37:29.666
Well, I think.

810
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.962
That's funny, 'cause I never took you
for much of a thinker.

811
00:37:34.671 --> 00:37:37.173
Oh, yeah, sure.
I think about all kind of things:

812
00:37:37.799 --> 00:37:39.008
Good Burger...

813
00:37:39.884 --> 00:37:41.094
squirrels...

814
00:37:41.636 --> 00:37:42.887
cardboard boxes...

815
00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:44.973
things that are sticky...

816
00:37:45.056 --> 00:37:47.267
I'll bet you don't have one real problem.

817
00:37:47.350 --> 00:37:49.853
Um, I got six toes on my left foot.

818
00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:52.897
What kind of problems do you have?

819
00:37:52.981 --> 00:37:55.024
Other than the ones you cause? Lots.

820
00:37:56.401 --> 00:37:58.653
Most of them started
when I was a little kid.

821
00:37:59.237 --> 00:38:01.698
That's when my dad
left me and my mom. [scoffs]

822
00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:04.742
I must have lived in 15 places since then.

823
00:38:05.952 --> 00:38:08.204
I remember the last time I saw my dad.

824
00:38:08.872 --> 00:38:10.290
I was seven years old,

825
00:38:10.957 --> 00:38:13.460
and for no reason at all,
he bought me this yo-yo.

826
00:38:14.335 --> 00:38:15.670
It was so cool.

827
00:38:15.753 --> 00:38:18.173
I mean, it wasn't just an ordinary yo-yo.

828
00:38:18.256 --> 00:38:20.967
It had lights that lit up
when you yo-yoed it.

829
00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:24.512
Red lights on one side,
and blue lights on the other.

830
00:38:25.221 --> 00:38:27.682
And it made
this funky whistling noise too.

831
00:38:27.765 --> 00:38:30.643
Wow. That sounds like quite a yo-yo.

832
00:38:30.727 --> 00:38:31.853
You... you still got it?

833
00:38:32.687 --> 00:38:33.688
No.

834
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:36.274
After a while, it stopped lighting up.

835
00:38:37.275 --> 00:38:39.444
Then it quit making
that funky whistling noise.

836
00:38:40.695 --> 00:38:42.864
Then I guess my mom just threw it away.

837
00:38:44.824 --> 00:38:46.784
[scoffs] You know...

838
00:38:48.369 --> 00:38:50.580
I don't even remember
what my dad looks like.

839
00:38:52.957 --> 00:38:55.418
I don't remember
what my dad looks like either.

840
00:38:56.503 --> 00:38:58.880
But at least I get to see him every day.

841
00:39:01.299 --> 00:39:04.135
[chuckles] I give up. I'm going home.

842
00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:12.602
Oh, h... hey, Dex.

843
00:39:12.685 --> 00:39:15.146
Uh, thanks for hanging out with me.

844
00:39:16.648 --> 00:39:19.400
It's no problem. See you tomorrow, buddy.

845
00:39:22.529 --> 00:39:24.155
You... You mean it?

846
00:39:25.865 --> 00:39:26.866
Mean what?

847
00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:28.618
Well, I'm your buddy.

848
00:39:28.701 --> 00:39:30.578
You... You called me your buddy.

849
00:39:31.955 --> 00:39:33.831
Yeah, sure. I guess so.

850
00:39:34.457 --> 00:39:35.667
See you tomorrow.

851
00:39:40.964 --> 00:39:42.715
Dexter, you got a delivery.

852
00:39:42.799 --> 00:39:44.342
You are going to freak.

853
00:39:45.969 --> 00:39:47.136
[gasps] Ooh!

854
00:39:48.096 --> 00:39:50.014
Hey, Monique, um, check it.

855
00:39:50.098 --> 00:39:52.433
I got a delivery to make.
You want to ride with me?

856
00:39:52.517 --> 00:39:54.227
Oh, I want to go, I want to go.

857
00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:55.937
Oh, yeah.

858
00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:57.146
You can go, Ed.

859
00:39:57.855 --> 00:39:58.982
Yay!

860
00:39:59.649 --> 00:40:00.984
Oh, man.

861
00:40:02.193 --> 00:40:03.820
[tires squealing]

862
00:40:06.406 --> 00:40:07.407
[Dexter] Ed.

863
00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:10.118
Ed, man, you gotta park the burger.
Slow down.

864
00:40:10.201 --> 00:40:11.452
[Ed] Huh.

[tires screech]

Whoa!

870
00:40:27.844 --> 00:40:29.971
Come on, man. The locker room's this way.

871
00:40:30.555 --> 00:40:33.725
[reporter] So, after scoring that amazing,
last-minute, game-winning shot,

872
00:40:33.808 --> 00:40:37.270
and bringing your team all the way

00:56:12.746 --> 00:56:15.457
Who are you,
and what have done with the real Monique?

1221
00:56:16.041 --> 00:56:17.417
Oh, she's right here.

1222
00:56:17.501 --> 00:56:20.003
It's just that now she knows
the real Dexter.

1223
00:56:20.087 --> 00:56:21.296
Come again?

1224
00:56:23.632 --> 00:56:25.926
- You forgot your jacket last night.
- Oh. Thank you.

1225
00:56:26.426 --> 00:56:27.886
And this fell out of the pocket.

1226
00:56:33.183 --> 00:56:34.977
Oh, um... this?

1227
00:56:35.060 --> 00:56:37.271
This is just, all it is...

1228
00:56:37.354 --> 00:56:38.397
All... All it is...

1229
00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:40.566
Right, it's just the contract
you had Ed sign.

1230
00:56:40.649 --> 00:56:43.026
You know, the one where
you take most of his money,

1231
00:56:43.110 --> 00:56:45.112
the money he's supposed
to get for his sauce?

1232
00:56:45.195 --> 00:56:46.738
No... yeah.

1233
00:56:46.822 --> 00:56:48.365
But, look, I was just trying...

1234
00:56:48.448 --> 00:56:51.201
You know, I can't believe
that you would do something like that

1235
00:56:51.285 --> 00:56:52.661
to someone who trusts you.

1236
00:56:52.744 --> 00:56:54.997
How can you take advantage
of a sweet person like Ed?

1237
00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:56.873
And after he got you a job?

1238
00:56:56.957 --> 00:56:58.709
It ain't even like that. I only wanted...

1239
00:56:58.792 --> 00:57:00.794
Oh, I know what you wanted.

1240
00:57:00.877 --> 00:57:02.546
You're not Ed's friend.

1241
00:57:02.629 --> 00:57:05.549
You're just using him
to scam a little cash on the side.

1242
00:57:06.258 --> 00:57:07.593
It must feel really good.

1243
00:57:10.304 --> 00:57:12.931
- Babe...
- Oh, but don't worry.

1244
00:57:13.015 --> 00:57:15.017
I'm not going to tell Ed
that you're cheating him.

1245
00:57:15.726 --> 00:57:16.727
Why not?

1246
00:57:18.729 --> 00:57:20.689
Because it would hurt him too much.

1247
00:57:31.700 --> 00:57:32.868
Punk.

1248
00:57:35.412 --> 00:57:36.455
Mm!

1249
00:57:45.547 --> 00:57:46.757
There you are, Ed.

1250
00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:48.216
Um, can I sit here?

1251
00:57:49.217 --> 00:57:50.719
On my lap?

1252
00:57:50.802 --> 00:57:53.680
No, man.
I... I'll just sit down right next to you.

1253
00:57:55.307 --> 00:57:58.727
All right, look, Ed,
I don't know how to say this.

1254
00:57:58.810 --> 00:58:00.020
Oh, you just go...

1255
00:58:00.729 --> 00:58:03.774
"This."

1256
00:58:04.441 --> 00:58:07.027
No, um, I...
I'm talking about this contract.

1257
00:58:09.112 --> 00:58:10.697
- [barking]
- What is it, boy?

1258
00:58:11.448 --> 00:58:12.908
Oh, wha... What?

1259
00:58:13.950 --> 00:58:15.202
Four clowns?

1260
00:58:16.036 --> 00:58:18.121
What? Their car's broken down?

1261
00:58:18.205 --> 00:58:19.623
They're in trouble?

1262
00:58:19.706 --> 00:58:21.750
Man, that dog is not talking to you.

1263
00:58:21.833 --> 00:58:23.210
W... wait, hang on.

1264
00:58:23.293 --> 00:58:27.005
He's trying to tell us there's four clowns
stuck somewhere and their car broke down.

1265
00:58:28.006 --> 00:58:29.383
Where, boy? Where?

1266
00:58:29.466 --> 00:58:31.593
Ed, there are no clowns.

1267
00:58:31.677 --> 00:58:33.345
Man, that dog is just hungry.

1268
00:58:33.428 --> 00:58:35.514
Oh, well, maybe we should feed him.

1269
00:58:40.435 --> 00:58:42.479
Here, have a Mondo Burger.

1270
00:58:43.188 --> 00:58:44.731
[whimpering]

1271
00:58:46.316 --> 00:58:48.360
Oh. He's not eating it.

1272
00:58:48.443 --> 00:58:50.612
- [sniffing]
- Well, what's wrong?

1273
00:58:51.405 --> 00:58:52.572
I don't know.

1274
00:58:52.656 --> 00:58:55.367
- He definitely looks hungry though.
- Yeah.

1275
00:58:55.450 --> 00:58:57.077
Well, here.

1276
00:58:59.121 --> 00:59:00.330
Try a Good Burger.

1277
00:59:03.959 --> 00:59:05.293
Would you look at that?

1278
00:59:05.377 --> 00:59:07.087
[grunts] See?

1279
00:59:07.629 --> 00:59:10.382
I told you there was something wrong
with Mondo Burger.

1280
00:59:10.465 --> 00:59:12.634
He knows it, don't you, boy?

1281
00:59:13.301 --> 00:59:15.470
He definitely senses
something he doesn't like.

1282
00:59:16.054 --> 00:59:17.556
What do you think it could be?

1283
00:59:18.557 --> 00:59:19.725
I don't know.

1284
00:59:20.976 --> 00:59:22.185
Let's find out.

1285
00:59:24.730 --> 00:59:26.815
Where is that dang dog?

1286
00:59:26.898 --> 00:59:28.400
[coughing]

1287
00:59:34.781 --> 00:59:36.575
Excuse me, ladies, may I help you?

1288
00:59:36.658 --> 00:59:40.912
Could you kindly point us in the direction
of the little girls' room?

1289
00:59:40.996 --> 00:59:43.999
Yes, ma'am. The ladies room is just
on the other side of the restaurant.

1290
00:59:44.082 --> 00:59:45.125
I'll show you.

1291
00:59:45.208 --> 00:59:47.961
- Oh, get your hands off of me!
- Ma'am!

1292
00:59:48.044 --> 00:59:49.463
[shouting, indistinct]

1293
00:59:49.546 --> 00:59:52.257
- Ma'am, I'm just trying to help.
- I don't need your... Oh!

1294
00:59:53.341 --> 00:59:54.341
Oh! Oh!

1295
00:59:54.968 --> 00:59:56.011
[coughs]

1296
00:59:56.094 --> 00:59:58.805
Water! Water! I need water!

1297
00:59:59.514 --> 01:00:01.892
Whoo! Water! Oh!

1298
01:00:01.975 --> 01:00:03.143
Water! Ooh!

1299
01:00:03.226 --> 01:00:05.395
Water! Oh! Water! Oh!

1300
01:00:05.479 --> 01:00:07.189
Okay, I'll be right back.

1301
01:00:07.272 --> 01:00:09.816
Water! Water, water, water!

1302
01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:11.359
Whoo! Oh, oh.

1303
01:00:12.027 --> 01:00:14.946
- All right, let's go.
- Hey, what about your water?

1304
01:00:15.030 --> 01:00:16.490
Would you just come on?

1305
01:00:30.879 --> 01:00:33.298
[sizzling]

1306
01:00:43.683 --> 01:00:46.478
H... Hey, what's that stuff
they're dropping in the burgers?

1307
01:00:46.561 --> 01:00:47.729
[Dexter] I don't know.

1308
01:00:47.813 --> 01:00:50.690
But I bet that's what's making
those burgers grow so big.

1309
01:00:51.608 --> 01:00:53.652
We should get some
of that stuff for Good Burger.

1310
01:00:53.735 --> 01:00:56.363
No, man,
stuff like that's gotta be illegal.

1311
01:00:56.446 --> 01:00:57.906
[Kurt] It is illegal.

1312
01:00:57.989 --> 01:01:00.075
- [Dexter] Whoo!
- [Ed] Oh!

1313
01:01:04.704 --> 01:01:07.415
Triampathol is way illegal.

1314
01:01:09.209 --> 01:01:10.377
But I tell you what.

1315
01:01:10.961 --> 01:01:13.964
It sure makes burgers nice and "enormo."

1316
01:01:14.047 --> 01:01:15.382
Yeah, that's all well and good,

1317
01:01:15.465 --> 01:01:18.301
but what happens
to all those nice, innocent people

1318
01:01:18.385 --> 01:01:20.470
when they eat your "enormo" burgers?

1319
01:01:20.554 --> 01:01:22.013
Uh-oh.

1320
01:01:22.097 --> 01:01:23.682
Don't care, ladies.

1321
01:01:26.226 --> 01:01:27.853
Ooh! Uh...

1322
01:01:28.645 --> 01:01:30.772
[laughing]

1323
01:01:33.859 --> 01:01:36.152
Yeah, yeah, laugh it up. Uh-huh.

1324
01:01:36.987 --> 01:01:39.907
But when those people find out you're
putting illegal stuff in their meat,

1325
01:01:39.948 --> 01:01:41.867
you're going to find yourself in jail.

1326
01:01:42.701 --> 01:01:46.997
That is why nobody outside this kitchen
is going to find out.

1327
01:01:47.622 --> 01:01:49.916
What do you expect us to do,
keep our mouths shut?

1328
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.586
No. I'll keep your mouths shut.

1329
01:01:53.712 --> 01:01:55.046
Ed, run!

1330
01:01:55.797 --> 01:01:56.798
[groans]

1331
01:01:58.008 --> 01:01:59.009
[sighs]

1332
01:02:03.013 --> 01:02:06.641
Okay, hot pants.
Now, I'm tired of playing games.

1333
01:02:06.725 --> 01:02:09.269
I want to know what's in your sauce.

1334
01:02:09.352 --> 01:02:10.645
Well, you can forget it.

1335
01:02:10.729 --> 01:02:12.814
You're not going to get Ed's sauce.

1336
01:02:14.441 --> 01:02:17.485
I want to know what's in your sauce.

1337
01:02:18.361 --> 01:02:20.530
Dude, you need a Tic Tac.

1338
01:02:20.614 --> 01:02:22.032
Ha-ha!

1339
01:02:22.115 --> 01:02:24.743
That coils it. You guys are grass.

1340
01:02:24.826 --> 01:02:26.536
What are we going to do with them?

1341
01:02:28.413 --> 01:02:30.373
Get our pal Wade on the phone.

1342
01:02:30.999 --> 01:02:32.459
Demented Hills?

1343
01:02:33.501 --> 01:02:34.502
[chuckles]

1344
01:02:46.222 --> 01:02:48.725
[tires screeching]

1345
01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:55.982
Hey, all right, yeah.
Hey, easy, man, easy.

1346
01:02:56.066 --> 01:02:58.401
Yeah, all right. Uh-huh.
See, you think you're strong.

1347
01:02:58.485 --> 01:03:00.278
You'll never be
half the man your mama was.

1348
01:03:00.362 --> 01:03:01.780
[grunting]

1349
01:03:01.863 --> 01:03:03.448
Hey, man, you better let me go!

1350
01:03:03.531 --> 01:03:05.450
- [man] You too!
- [grunting]

1351
01:03:05.533 --> 01:03:07.160
Hey, man, open this door!

1352
01:03:07.243 --> 01:03:09.412
I ain't... I'm not going to tell you again!

1353
01:03:10.205 --> 01:03:12.499
All right,
maybe I'll tell you one more time.

1354
01:03:12.582 --> 01:03:15.210
Open this door, please? Oh.

1355
01:03:15.293 --> 01:03:18.254
Look, Dex, the walls are padded!
Look what I can do!

1356
01:03:18.338 --> 01:03:20.423

I don't get it. I... I just don't get it.

1360
01:03:33.687 --> 01:03:34.980
Where could they be?

1361
01:03:35.563 --> 01:03:37.273
I'm really worried, you guys.

Uh, huh... Hi.

1368
01:03:51.287 --> 01:03:52.372
I'm a psychopath.

1369

I'm Ed.

1370
01:03:55.250 --> 01:03:57.377
Have small space aliens
ever landed in your brain

1371
01:03:57.460 --> 01:03:59.921
and told you to break into the zoo
and free the kangaroos?

1372
01:04:01.381 --> 01:04:02.882
Not that I recall.

1373

Do you think I'm cute?

Sure. [chuckles]

What's cute about me?

1376
01:04:08.555 --> 01:04:10.724
Um... your head.

1377
01:04:12.726 --> 01:04:14.310
You have a cute head too.

1378
01:04:15.270 --> 01:04:18.523
[laughing] Well, I try to keep it nice.

1379
01:04:18.606 --> 01:04:20.150
So, what you in for?

1380
01:04:20.233 --> 01:04:24.446
I got in trouble for breaking into the zoo
and freeing all the kangaroos.

1381
01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:28.241
Oh. [chuckles]

1382
01:04:29.492 --> 01:04:30.827
My name is Heather.

1383
01:04:30.910 --> 01:04:33.038
Really? My mom's name is Heather.

1384
01:04:33.121 --> 01:04:34.330
Really?

1385
01:04:35.749 --> 01:04:36.750
No.

Oh.

01:04:43.590 --> 01:04:46.301
Uh... go fish.

1390
01:04:49.387 --> 01:04:51.222
Would you stop eating the cards?

1391
01:04:51.306 --> 01:04:53.600
And quit poking me. Are you crazy?

1392
01:04:57.479 --> 01:04:58.521

And a vanilla pop for you.

1576
01:14:27.506 --> 01:14:30.718

We gotta get there and make sure
nobody eats that poison sauce.

Yeah, but...

01:18:24.285 --> 01:18:26.829
Ed, get off! Ed, off the elderly.

- I just tackled some old lady.

- All right, Ed! Way to go.
- Cool.

1655
01:18:35.921 --> 01:18:39.925
Excuse me, would one of you two
mind telling me why this is a good thing?

1656
01:18:41.302 --> 01:18:43.846
This is why.
Mondo Burger poisoned our sauce.

1657
01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:46.473
How could Mondo Burger poison our sauce?

1658
01:18:46.557 --> 01:18:48.642
We'll explain it to you later.

1659
01:18:48.726 --> 01:18:51.645
Right now, just keep everyone
from eating that sauce, and call the cops.

1660
01:18:51.729 --> 01:18:52.730
Come on, Ed.

1661
01:18:52.813 --> 01:18:55.733
- Where are we going?
- To get a can of Triampathol.

- What for?
- Proof.

I need a hot Jacuzzi.

- Shall I ring?
- No!

1667
01:19:20.549 --> 01:19:24.219
You can't just walk up there and ring
the bell and say, "Howdy-do, neighbor."

1668
01:19:24.303 --> 01:19:26.764
We gotta find a way
to sneak into the kitchen somehow.

1669
01:19:27.473 --> 01:19:29.308
I got an idea. Huh.

1670

Whoo!

1675
01:19:40.194 --> 01:19:43.280
Shouldn't you have a harness or some rope?

Come on! It's easy!

I don't even know the person
that owns this truck.

01:20:12.977 --> 01:20:14.561
All right. You got it.

1691
01:20:14.645 --> 01:20:18.190
Got what? I'm swinging from a dang pipe.

1692
01:20:18.857 --> 01:20:20.734

- Over here!

Over here! Come on!

1700
01:20:44.425 --> 01:20:45.926
What are you doing in the straw?

1701
01:20:46.010 --> 01:20:48.637
Well, it's right over the kitchen.
I can see it.

1702
01:20:48.721 --> 01:20:50.222
Come on!

1703
01:20:50.305 --> 01:20:52.641
- How do expect me to get up there?
- Oh, it's easy.

1704
01:20:52.725 --> 01:20:55.227
You just jump on the burger,
jump on the fry,

1705
01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:57.813
and then you hop on the cup,
and then shimmy up the straw.

1706
01:20:58.689 --> 01:21:00.607
What is this, <i>American Gladiators</i>?

1707
01:21:00.691 --> 01:21:01.692
Come on!

1708
01:21:02.359 --> 01:21:03.360
All right.

Can't believe
this man got me climbing on a straw.

1711
01:21:12.411 --> 01:21:13.412
Ooh!

1712
01:21:14.329 --> 01:21:17.291
Wow. Good Burger looks so small
from up here.

1714

01:21:24.214 --> 01:21:26.133
Here, take my hand.

Whee!

- Again! Again! That was cool!
- Shh! Listen, listen.

1720
01:21:43.567 --> 01:21:44.818
I'm gonna go into that kitchen.

1721
01:21:44.902 --> 01:21:47.780
I want you to count to ten and come in
and get a can of that chemical

1722
01:21:47.863 --> 01:21:49.865
and hightail it back to Good Burger,
all right?

1723
01:21:49.948 --> 01:21:51.492
- All right. Okay.
- All right.

1724
01:21:54.078 --> 01:21:55.287

Hey, everybody!

- What's happening?
- How'd you get here?

1729
01:22:07.674 --> 01:22:10.969
Ooh! Look at this fancy kitchen.

1730
01:22:11.053 --> 01:22:13.931
You know, Mama never had one of these
with the electronic numbers.

1731
01:22:14.014 --> 01:22:15.849
- We had to turn the knobs...
- Let's get him!

1732
01:22:15.933 --> 01:22:17.226
Wait for the little ding...

1733
01:22:19.269 --> 01:22:20.270
If I were you...

1734
01:22:21.563 --> 01:22:23.398
I wouldn't come any closer.

1735
01:22:24.525 --> 01:22:25.776
Get him.

Why don't you go on ahead

that you made your big Beefy Burgers

- Whoo! Come on, Ed.
- Huh.

1843
01:28:24.634 --> 01:28:27.262
So, you poured that stuff in that meat,
didn't you?

1844
01:28:27.345 --> 01:28:28.763
Huh, I had to.

1845
01:28:28.847 --> 01:28:30.474
- You had to?
- Sure.

1846
01:28:30.557 --> 01:28:32.184
See, I knew if I took the can,

1847
01:28:32.267 --> 01:28:34.561
there was a good chance
I'd get caught. Huh.

1848
01:28:34.644 --> 01:28:38.482
Then I thought, even if I did take
the Triampathol to the proper authorities,

1849
01:28:38.565 --> 01:28:41.693
huh, Kurt would hire some
high-powered attorneys

1850
01:28:41.776 --> 01:28:45.071
who would dispute any charges
brought against him or Mondo Burger

1851
01:28:45.155 --> 01:28:46.948
by manipulating the legal system.

1852
01:28:47.032 --> 01:28:50.368
And the way that America's court system
is congested these days,

1853
01:28:50.452 --> 01:28:53.413
it would have taken months
to convict him of anything.

1854
01:28:53.497 --> 01:28:56.833
So then I thought,
I'll take the matters into my own hands

1855
01:28:56.917 --> 01:29:00.170
and just pour the Triampathol
into the meat supply

1856
01:29:00.253 --> 01:29:03.423
and let Mondo Burger be a victim
of its own foul play.
