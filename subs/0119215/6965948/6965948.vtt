00:08:16.287 --> 00:08:17.664
So what's your plan for the summer?

183
00:08:17.747 --> 00:08:19.374
Ha! Let me tell you, boy,

184
00:08:19.457 --> 00:08:22.669
I plan to wake up every day
at around noon,

185
00:08:23.003 --> 00:08:24.754
then I'm going to lay out by the pool,

186
00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:26.589
order some Chinese food,

187
00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:30.468
maybe invite some fine females
over to share an egg roll or two.

188
00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:33.972
Then I'm going to wake up the next day,
do it all over again.

189
00:08:34.055 --> 00:08:35.932
Ha, ha! Know what I'm saying?

190
00:08:36.391 --> 00:08:37.684
Say, man, you're lucky.

191
00:08:37.892 --> 00:08:39.811
My folks is making me get a summer job.

192
00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:41.688
See, that's it right there.

193
00:08:41.813 --> 00:08:43.982
You got to explain things to parents.

194
00:08:44.107 --> 00:08:45.567
Like summer vacation.

195
00:08:45.775 --> 00:08:49.195
The key word there is "va-ca-tion."

196
00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:50.947

Why?

Oh, brother Reed,
you have messed up my Afro.

Oh! See, when I left school today

223
00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.899
I didn't think I was gonna run into you
this summer.

224
00:10:07.982 --> 00:10:09.692
Or I didn't think you
was gonna run into me.

225
00:10:09.776 --> 00:10:11.319
I mean, just run into me like this.

226
00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:13.905
You're in trouble with me, young man.
You're in trouble with me!

227
00:10:13.988 --> 00:10:16.116
No, listen, Mr. Wheat, listen.
It wasn't my fault.

228
00:10:16.241 --> 00:10:17.700
See, this nut on some roller blades,

229
00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:21.412
he skated into my vision sight.
I couldn't see nothing, so I swerved...

-Roller blades?
-We was spinning around like that...

231
00:10:23.665 --> 00:10:26.042
-I don't want to hear it!
-...and then I couldn't control it...

232
00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:27.377
I don't want to hear it.

233
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:29.712
-Know how much that car cost me?
-No.

234
00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:31.005
-Do you know?
-No.

235
00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:32.340
That's a $22,000 car.

236
00:10:32.882 --> 00:10:35.260
$22,000! And that's just the base price!

237
00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:37.929
Check out the chrome, see?
I waited four weeks for the chrome!

238
00:10:38.096 --> 00:10:40.056
You can't get chrome wheels at base price!

They always get you with them extras.

Give me your driver's license.

Um, regarding my driver's license,

247
00:11:00.285 --> 00:11:02.912
I'd give it to you,
but you're going to have to wait.

248
00:11:03.037 --> 00:11:04.080
For what?

249
00:11:04.622 --> 00:11:06.332
-Oh, about a year.
-Oh, no.

250
00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:08.001
That's when I get one.

-No.

I know you don't have
no insurance, do you?

254
00:11:13.548 --> 00:11:16.509
I hate to do this, young man,
I hate to put a black man in jail,

255
00:11:16.593 --> 00:11:18.845
-but I'm gonna have to call the police.
-Black man in jail?

No, no, no, not the police.
Don't call the police.

No, please, don't call them.

Please, don't call the police!

260
00:11:26.144 --> 00:11:28.479
They can't find out I was driving
without a license, sir, please.

261
00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:30.857
No, please, let me fix it.

262
00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.150
Just let me fix it, please.

263
00:11:32.233 --> 00:11:34.402
-You shouldn't have been driving.
-No, let me fix it!

264
00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:37.864
-All right.
-All right?

265
00:11:38.072 --> 00:11:39.365
Yeah, all right. Yeah.

266
00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:41.284
Yeah, I'll let you fix the car.

267
00:11:41.826 --> 00:11:44.913
So, uh, how much you think
it's going to cost to fix?

268
00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:50.210
$1,900?

269
00:11:50.585 --> 00:11:52.420
I don't have $1,900.

270
00:11:52.795 --> 00:11:54.881
That's all right.
Maybe your parents will help you out.

271
00:11:54.964 --> 00:11:57.926
-I'll just give them a call...
-Ooh, um, wait. I'll get the money.

272
00:11:58.051 --> 00:11:59.260
You can't get the money.

273

I know you got a summer,
you just want to be free.

274

-No, wait, wait, wait, wait.

do the wrong...

It was him.

Why, I should've known.

there are no comedians.

and you go into the grinder.

Okay, now this grinder of yours,

00:15:26.676 --> 00:15:29.512
is it a real grinder
or is it some kind of a metaphor?

Yeah. It's my very own recipe.

Hey, what did you...?

Mmm.

This is really good.
What did you guys put on this?

[Mr. Baily] Hey, hey...

722
00:32:04.172 --> 00:32:06.216
Hey! What in the name of ground beef
is going on?

723
00:32:06.341 --> 00:32:07.634
Mr. Baily, try this.

-This is marvelous. What is it?

A French fry.

728
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:17.602
I know that, Ed.
I'm talking about the sauce.

729
00:32:18.061 --> 00:32:20.772
-What's in the sauce?
-Ed's ingredients. He made it himself.

-Ed?
-Excellent.

-[Deedee] It's awesome.
-It makes me glad I'm not dead.

732
00:32:25.277 --> 00:32:28.238
Ed! If we put that sauce
on all the Good Burgers,

733
00:32:28.321 --> 00:32:29.698
then everyone will want to eat here.

734
00:32:30.157 --> 00:32:32.534
We'll knock Mondo Burger

-[Deedee] Yeah!

Ed, get in that kitchen
and start making sauce.

Now, you do remember that it was my idea

778
00:34:10.882 --> 00:34:13.593
to put the sauce on Good Burgers
in the first place, right?

779
00:34:13.802 --> 00:34:15.804
Yeah, you should get some
of the money I receive.

I'm glad to hear you say that.

781

In fact, since we're going to be
in business together,

782
00:34:21.184 --> 00:34:23.144
I thought that maybe
we should sign a little contract.

00:34:40.996 --> 00:34:43.456
Ah. So, what does it all mean, Dexter?

793
00:34:43.957 --> 00:34:45.792
Well, it's quite simple, really.

794
00:34:45.917 --> 00:34:48.670
Of all the money that Good Burger
makes off your sauce,

795
00:34:48.795 --> 00:34:50.714
you get to keep 20%.

796
00:34:50.922 --> 00:34:52.007
Cool? Okay.

797
00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:56.136
And then I'll keep the other 80%,
so it works out cool for both of us.

What do you put in that sauce?

Well, you start off
with a little lemon juice

805
00:35:11.651 --> 00:35:12.652
and some ketchup--

-No. Listen to me carefully.
-Okay.

809
00:35:20.785 --> 00:35:22.996
Do not tell anyone
the recipe to your sauce.

810
00:35:23.371 --> 00:35:25.707
Oh. Well, first you start off
with a little lemon juice--

811
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:27.751
Stop it! Stop talking.

812
00:35:28.752 --> 00:35:32.255
Never tell anyone
the ingredients of your sauce.

813
00:35:32.631 --> 00:35:33.632
Why?

814
00:35:33.882 --> 00:35:35.508
You want to save Good Burger, don't you?

815
00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.344
Oh, yeah. Good Burger's my life.

816
00:35:37.636 --> 00:35:40.722
Well, then, you got to keep
your sauce recipe a secret.

817
00:35:40.847 --> 00:35:42.098
-All right?
-Okay.

818
00:35:42.182 --> 00:35:43.767
-All right.
-Um, Dexter?

This is where I come to think.

856
00:37:28.204 --> 00:37:29.706
Well, I think.

857
00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:32.208
That's funny,

858
00:37:32.375 --> 00:37:34.586
'cause I never took you
for much of a thinker.

859
00:37:34.836 --> 00:37:37.422

things that are sticky...

864
00:37:45.221 --> 00:37:47.265
I'll bet you don't have one real problem.

865
00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:50.185
Um, I got six toes on my left foot.

866
00:37:50.894 --> 00:37:52.645
What kind of problems do you have?

867
00:37:53.062 --> 00:37:55.023
Other than the ones you cause? Lots.

868
00:37:56.566 --> 00:37:58.818
Most of them started
when I was a little kid.

869
00:37:59.319 --> 00:38:01.571
That's when my dad left me and my mom.

870
00:38:02.322 --> 00:38:04.741
I must have lived in 15 places since then.

871
00:38:06.075 --> 00:38:08.203
I remember the last time I saw my Dad.

872
00:38:08.912 --> 00:38:10.330
I was seven years old,

873
00:38:11.039 --> 00:38:13.541
and for no reason at all,
he bought me this yo-yo.

874
00:38:14.501 --> 00:38:15.710
It was so cool.

875
00:38:15.877 --> 00:38:17.962
I mean, it wasn't just an ordinary yo-yo.

876
00:38:18.379 --> 00:38:20.965
It had lights that lit up
when you yo-yoed it.

877
00:38:21.257 --> 00:38:24.594
Red lights on one side,
and blue lights on the other.

878
00:38:25.386 --> 00:38:27.806
And it made this funky,
whistling noise, too.

879
00:38:27.931 --> 00:38:30.642
Wow. That sounds like quite a yo-yo.

880
00:38:30.934 --> 00:38:32.310
