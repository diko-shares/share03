00:02:30.992 --> 00:02:34.204
This is a tale about
an unprejudiced heart...

2
00:02:34.287 --> 00:02:37.582
and how it changed our valley
forever.

3
00:02:37.624 --> 00:02:39.918
There was a time
not so long ago...

4
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.422
when pigs were afforded no respect
except by other pigs.

5
00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:49.511
They lived their whole lives
in a cruel and sunless world.

6
00:03:03.733 --> 00:03:08.613
In those days, pigs believed that
the sooner they grew large and fat,

7
00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:11.658
the sooner they'd be taken
into pig paradise.

8
00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:15.453
- Haa! Haa! Get up!
- A place so wonderful...

9
00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:19.624
- that no pig had ever thought to come back.
- Yo! Yeah!

10
00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.677
Good-bye, Mom.

11
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.308
So when the day came for their parents to
go to that other world of endless pleasures,

12
00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:39.019
it was not a time
for young pigs to be sad.

13
00:03:39.102 --> 00:03:44.357
Just another step towards the day when
they, too, would make the journey.

14
00:03:56.912 --> 00:04:01.208
Perhaps it was because he was alone.

15
00:04:01.333 --> 00:04:04.753
Perhaps his sadness
made him easier to catch.

16
00:04:04.836 --> 00:04:08.298
Whatever the reason, of the thousands
of animals in the piggery that day...

17
00:04:08.423 --> 00:04:11.092
only one was chosen.

18
00:04:11.176 --> 00:04:13.345
- How's this one, Harry?
- Just right for the purpose.

19
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.641
- How much do I owe you?
- It's a runt, Harry. A worthless, little runt.

20
00:04:32.989 --> 00:04:36.243
You're too modest, Esme Hoggett.

21
00:04:36.326 --> 00:04:38.745
Nine out of ten first prizes
for jams and jellies...

22
00:04:38.829 --> 00:04:40.747
is more than
a matter of luck.

23
00:04:40.831 --> 00:04:44.417
Luck still plays its part. Our berries
were wickedly good this year.

24
00:04:44.501 --> 00:04:47.087
And our water
is very tasty too.

25
00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.881
Of course, we don't use
the town water.

26
00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:56.638
Arthur Hoggett!
How's it going, Arthur?

27
00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.099
How are those sheep of yours?
Come on, try your luck.

28
00:04:59.182 --> 00:05:02.894
How about taking a guess, Arthur?
All for a good cause.

29
00:05:05.355 --> 00:05:10.068
- Don't keep pigs.
- Christmas day. Think of it. What a feast!

30
00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:13.864
That'll do, Pig.

31
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.329
The pig and the farmer
regarded each other.

32
00:05:21.454 --> 00:05:25.041
And for a fleeting moment,
something passed between them.

33
00:05:25.125 --> 00:05:30.046
- A faint sense of some common destiny.
- Hah. Strange.

34
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.674
First time the little thing
hasn't screamed its head off.

35
00:05:32.716 --> 00:05:36.094
Now you'll have
to have a guess.

36
00:05:37.471 --> 00:05:40.182
Sixteen pounds, five...

37
00:05:42.142 --> 00:05:44.269
Eew.

38
00:05:48.648 --> 00:05:50.567
Two ounces.

39
00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:01.036
Hooey! Hoggett!

40
00:06:01.077 --> 00:06:04.581
Thanks, Arthur. We'll be weighing
the little pig tomorrow.

41
00:06:04.664 --> 00:06:06.958
We'll phone you
if you win.

42
00:06:07.042 --> 00:06:11.087
When you win, Arthur.
When you win!

43
00:06:11.171 --> 00:06:13.215
Care to guess
the pig's weight, sir?

44
00:06:13.256 --> 00:06:15.467
Support the Lion's Club.

45
00:06:38.573 --> 00:06:40.617
Ooh!

46
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.619
What could we do
with a pig, eh, Duchess?

47
00:06:42.702 --> 00:06:45.914
Just think. Two nice hams.
Two sides of bacon.

48
00:06:45.997 --> 00:06:50.627
Oh, and pork chops, kidney, liver,
chitlins, pickle his feet.

49
00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.588
Save his blood for black puddin'. There's the telephone.

50
00:06:53.672 --> 00:06:55.340
Hoggett!

51
00:06:55.382 --> 00:06:58.969
Good news, Arthur.
You've won the pig.

52
00:06:59.052 --> 00:07:01.263
Oh.

53
00:07:03.723 --> 00:07:07.894
Pigs are definitely stupid.

54
00:07:20.282 --> 00:07:22.242
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

55
00:07:25.245 --> 00:07:27.622
- What is it, Mom?
- That's a pig.

56
00:07:27.747 --> 00:07:30.208
- They'll eat him when he's big.
- Will they eat us?

57
00:07:30.333 --> 00:07:34.254
Good heavens, no! The bosses
only eat stupid animals...

58
00:07:34.379 --> 00:07:36.882
like sheep and ducks
and chickens.

59
00:07:36.965 --> 00:07:40.886
Yea!

60
00:07:45.682 --> 00:07:48.310
It does look stupid,
Mom.

61
00:07:48.393 --> 00:07:52.230
Not as stupid as sheep, mind you.
But pigs are definitely stupid.

62
00:07:52.314 --> 00:07:55.775
Excuse me.
No, we're not.

63
00:07:55.859 --> 00:07:58.904
- Good heavens! Who are you?
- I'm a Large White.

64
00:07:58.945 --> 00:08:02.282
- Yes, that's your breed, dear. What's your name?
- I don't know.

65
00:08:02.365 --> 00:08:06.620
What did your mother call you to tell
you apart from your brothers and sisters?

66
00:08:06.703 --> 00:08:08.830
Our mom called us
all the same.

67
00:08:08.914 --> 00:08:10.665
And what was that,
dear?

68
00:08:10.749 --> 00:08:13.126
She called us all Babe.

69
00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:16.463
Perhaps we shouldn't talk
too much about, uh, family.

70
00:08:16.546 --> 00:08:21.843
I want my mom.

71
00:08:25.472 --> 00:08:29.267
There, there. You've got
to be a brave boy now.

72
00:08:29.309 --> 00:08:33.605
I left my mother when I was your age,
and my pups will have to leave me soon.

73
00:08:33.647 --> 00:08:36.608
But I'll keep an eye on you, if you
like, just 'til you find your feet.

74
00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.617
The little pig's a bit low.
He's going to sleep with us...

75
00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:48.745
just 'til he finds his feet.

76
00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:56.419
Until he finds his feet.

77
00:08:58.505 --> 00:09:00.924
But, Mom,
he'll wet the bed!

78
00:09:01.007 --> 00:09:02.801
Nonsense!

79
00:09:02.884 --> 00:09:06.012
If you do want to do anything,
you'll go outside, won't you?

80
00:09:06.096 --> 00:09:10.767
Good boy.

81
00:09:10.809 --> 00:09:12.936
Yea!

82
00:09:12.978 --> 00:09:16.606
Yeah! Yeah!
Stomp on him!

83
00:09:16.648 --> 00:09:19.317
What's your name, Pig?

84
00:09:19.401 --> 00:09:22.946
- What does he taste like?
- Where did he come from?

85
00:09:43.925 --> 00:09:46.595
Comin' through!
Hey, get lost!

86
00:09:55.896 --> 00:09:58.315
We've got to do something
about that duck.

87
00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.443
Ooh! Ooh!

88
00:10:01.485 --> 00:10:03.445
Doodle-loo-dee-doo.

89
00:10:03.528 --> 00:10:05.530
- What's that noise?
- It's only Ferdinand.

90
00:10:05.614 --> 00:10:07.532
- What's Ferdinand?
- He's a duck.

91
00:10:07.616 --> 00:10:10.619
- He wants to be a rooster.
- He hates being a duck.

92
00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:14.748
- We'll catch him one day and eat him. Won't we, Mom?
- Yes, dear.

93
00:10:14.789 --> 00:10:20.128
Yech!
Who'd want to eat a duck?

94
00:10:45.028 --> 00:10:48.198
Babe, you wait here.

95
00:10:48.281 --> 00:10:50.659
- Aren't pigs allowed?
- Not live ones.

96
00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.995
- Sorry, dear. Only dogs and cats inside the house.
- Why?

97
00:10:54.079 --> 00:10:56.206
That's just the way
things are.

98
00:11:11.304 --> 00:11:13.140
Whoa!

99
00:11:15.475 --> 00:11:18.562
- Ow!
- Pig-pig- piggy!

100
00:11:18.645 --> 00:11:21.982
Ooh, what a spectacular feast
I've got for you.

101
00:11:22.065 --> 00:11:25.152
Oh, yes! What a lucky
little pork chop you are.

102
00:11:25.193 --> 00:11:27.821
Delicious! Oh, yes!
Yum, yum, yum.

103
00:11:27.863 --> 00:11:30.240
Who's gonna grow up
to be a big, fat pig?

104
00:11:30.323 --> 00:11:34.411
You are! You are!
Yum, yum, yum.

105
00:11:44.428 --> 00:11:47.181
- Where are we going?
- To work with the sheep.

106
00:11:47.265 --> 00:11:50.351
- What's sheep?
- Sheep is animals with thick, woolly coats.

107
00:11:50.434 --> 00:11:52.979
And thick woolly heads. And men
can't look after them without us.

108
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:58.484
- Why do they need us?
- 'Cause we're sheepdogs! Yea!

109
00:12:10.663 --> 00:12:13.499
- Not you, dear.
- Why not?

110
00:12:13.541 --> 00:12:17.712
We have to do dogs' work. You're a pig.
Your job is to stay here and eat your food.

111
00:12:17.837 --> 00:12:20.965
We'll be back
at the end of the day.

112
00:12:28.889 --> 00:12:32.768
They don't think
I'll remember. Well, I don't forget.

113
00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:35.813
Seems like a sheep's
just born to suffer.

114
00:12:35.896 --> 00:12:38.316
Hello?
Excuse me.

115
00:12:38.357 --> 00:12:40.359
Darn wolf!

116
00:12:40.443 --> 00:12:44.905
- I'm not a wolf. I'm a pig. What are you?
- Ewe.

117
00:12:44.989 --> 00:12:46.991
Pig. What are you?

118
00:12:47.074 --> 00:12:49.910
I'm a ewe.
A ewe!

119
00:12:49.994 --> 00:12:54.081
- You're a sheep!
- I'll not be called a common sheep, thank you kindly.

120
00:12:54.165 --> 00:12:56.834
I'm a Border Leicester ewe.
The name's Maa.

121
00:12:56.876 --> 00:12:59.545
Oh.

122
00:12:59.629 --> 00:13:03.633
- What's wrong with you, Maa?
- Foot rot. And I got me a nasty cough.

123
00:13:03.674 --> 00:13:07.887
And I'm not as young
as I used to be.

124
00:13:12.016 --> 00:13:13.976
Hmph.

125
00:13:17.396 --> 00:13:20.900
- Seem like a nice young pig. What be your name?
- Babe.

126
00:13:20.983 --> 00:13:23.819
Not like them wolves.
Treat you like dirt, they do!

127
00:13:23.903 --> 00:13:26.948
- Bite you as soon as look at you, those savages!
- Bite you?

128
00:13:27.031 --> 00:13:29.492
And worse.
Some wolves be so bad,

129
00:13:29.575 --> 00:13:31.827
they run a sheep down
and tear it to pieces.

130
00:13:31.911 --> 00:13:34.330
Fly would never do that!

131
00:13:34.413 --> 00:13:38.250
Fly, is it? A right vicious creature
she be, I'll tell you.

132
00:13:38.334 --> 00:13:42.254
- Not Fly.
- All them wolves is cruel to sheep. Always have been.

133
00:13:42.338 --> 00:13:45.174
Brutal savages!
That's what they be.

134
00:13:45.216 --> 00:13:49.512
I wouldn't want to see a gentle soul
like you mixin' with the likes of them.

135
00:14:01.357 --> 00:14:03.859
That afternoon when he saw Fly,

136
00:14:03.901 --> 00:14:07.113
the pig's mind
was a tangle of questions.

137
00:14:07.196 --> 00:14:10.366
Cruel, vicious, brutal?

138
00:14:10.408 --> 00:14:14.370
What was it that dogs did
in the fields all day?

139
00:14:14.412 --> 00:14:18.708
- Hello, Babe? Had a good day?
- Yes, thank you.

140
00:14:28.767 --> 00:14:32.090
The old sheep
had to be wrong about Fly.

141
00:14:32.135 --> 00:14:38.443
And the pig promised himself that he would
never think badly of any creature ever again.

142
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:44.367
Crime and Punishment!

143
00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:47.995
The morning of
the terrible crime...

144
00:14:48.037 --> 00:14:50.831
started like any other
on Hoggett Farm.

145
00:14:51.073 --> 00:14:54.034
Comin' through!
Comin' through!

146
00:14:54.118 --> 00:14:57.037
Take off!

147
00:14:59.123 --> 00:15:01.959
- Now!
- Up, up, up.

148
00:15:02.042 --> 00:15:04.545
Nee-nee-nee- nee.

149
00:15:04.628 --> 00:15:06.296
Alarm Ringing ] - Hmm?

150
00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:10.384
I was worried it might have a harsh tone,
but that's quite a nice musical ring.

151
00:15:10.467 --> 00:15:14.721
I walked into O'Halloran's Hardware,
and there it was waiting for me.

152
00:15:14.805 --> 00:15:16.200
What a splendid way
to wake up each morning!

153
00:15:16.417 --> 00:15:18.955
Hoggett, dear.
Church.

154
00:15:26.525 --> 00:15:29.486
When embarking
on an audacious crime,

155
00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:32.281
a duck needs
a willing accomplice.

156
00:15:32.364 --> 00:15:35.325
A creature who is reliable,
beyond suspicion,

157
00:15:35.409 --> 00:15:37.703
and above all,
extremely gullible.

158
00:15:37.828 --> 00:15:39.621
Hey! Psst!

159
00:15:39.746 --> 00:15:41.748
Wha... What?

160
00:15:41.874 --> 00:15:45.085
You look like an intelligent,
sophisticated, discerning young fella.

161
00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:50.090
- Who, me?
- Yeah. Follow me. Oh, boy! Are you in for some fun!

162
00:15:50.174 --> 00:15:53.385
What are we doin'?
Where are we goin'?

163
00:15:54.779 --> 00:15:57.823
Now the duck knew
exactly what he had to do.

164
00:15:57.907 --> 00:16:03.079
- The alarm clock had to go. His very life depended on it.
- Do you see it?

165
00:16:03.162 --> 00:16:06.791
- Yes.
- Good.

166
00:16:06.874 --> 00:16:10.044
So I go through the kitchen,
across the living room...

167
00:16:10.086 --> 00:16:12.296
- Good, good.
- into the bedroom.

168
00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:14.799
Get the mechanical rooster
and bring it out to you.

169
00:16:14.882 --> 00:16:17.843
- What about that cat?
- But quietly bring it out to you.

170
00:16:17.927 --> 00:16:20.179
- Excellent.
- I don't think I can do it.

171
00:16:20.262 --> 00:16:23.474
It's against the rules. Only dogs
and cats allowed in the house.

172
00:16:23.557 --> 00:16:27.978
It's a good rule, but this is bigger
than rules. This is life and death.

173
00:16:28.062 --> 00:16:30.606
- It is?
- Mm-hmm. Follow me.

174
00:16:32.108 --> 00:16:35.528
Hello! Look,
there's something you should know.

175
00:16:35.611 --> 00:16:39.281
- Humans eat ducks!
- I beg your pardon?

176
00:16:39.407 --> 00:16:43.536
Most ducks prefer to forget it, but the
fact is that humans like to eat plump ducks.

177
00:16:43.619 --> 00:16:46.789
I don't think so.
Not the boss. Not the boss's wife.

178
00:16:46.872 --> 00:16:49.542
Come on.
Humans don't eat cats. Why?

179
00:16:49.625 --> 00:16:51.836
Well, they're...
- They're indispensable. They catch mice.

180
00:16:51.961 --> 00:16:56.257
Humans don't eat roosters. Why? They make eggs
with the hens and wake up everyone in the morning.

181
00:16:56.382 --> 00:16:58.259
I tried it with the hens.
It didn't work.

182
00:16:58.342 --> 00:17:01.178
So I turned to crowing, and lo!
I discover my gift.

183
00:17:01.262 --> 00:17:05.433
But no sooner do I become indispensable
than they bring in a machine to do the job!

184
00:17:05.474 --> 00:17:07.935
Ah, the treachery of it!

185
00:17:07.977 --> 00:17:10.771
- A mechanical rooster!
- Oh, dear me.

186
00:17:10.813 --> 00:17:14.250
Oh, dear you?

187
00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:17.036
I suppose the life
of an anorexic duck...

188
00:17:17.078 --> 00:17:19.997
doesn't amount to much
in the broad scheme of things.

189
00:17:20.081 --> 00:17:22.083
But, Pig,

190
00:17:22.166 --> 00:17:24.961
I'm all I've got.

191
00:17:25.044 --> 00:17:26.963
Why do you need me
to do it?

192
00:17:27.046 --> 00:17:30.049
- I'm allergic to cats.
- Oh.

193
00:17:30.091 --> 00:17:32.468
They make me sneeze.

194
00:17:32.552 --> 00:17:34.512
Ahh.

195
00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:40.434
Don't worry.
I won't wake the cat.

196
00:17:41.894 --> 00:17:44.021
My life is in your hands.

197
00:17:44.105 --> 00:17:48.025
Oh, dear.

198
00:17:48.943 --> 00:17:50.903
Oh, no!

199
00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.860
Ah, boy.

200
00:18:53.174 --> 00:18:56.677
No, no, no!

201
00:19:05.019 --> 00:19:08.773
Your foot, your foot!
Take the string off your foot.

202
00:19:08.856 --> 00:19:12.777
Wait, wait. Let me put it this way.
Stop. Turn around...

203
00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.946
Shh.

204
00:19:16.489 --> 00:19:19.492
No, no!
The other way! Turn...

205
00:19:21.118 --> 00:19:23.287
No, stop! Oh!

206
00:19:24.747 --> 00:19:28.125
Stop!
Stop, stop, stop!

207
00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:38.803
Don't, don't, stupid.
Go outside... now.

208
00:19:38.928 --> 00:19:42.473
- But you said you can't do without me.
- I can. Trust me, I can.

209
00:19:42.557 --> 00:19:45.643
- Are you sure? You're positive?
- Yes!

210
00:19:45.726 --> 00:19:50.022
- Go outside and stand guard.
- Okay. Good idea.

211
00:19:58.114 --> 00:20:01.742
Oh, boy. Want something done,
you gotta do it yourself.

212
00:20:12.253 --> 00:20:15.089
- Hmm.
- Guard against what?

213
00:20:15.214 --> 00:20:17.967
Ahh! Ahh!
Don't worry.

214
00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:23.222
Stick with me and please,
I beg you, not one more word.

215
00:20:23.306 --> 00:20:25.016
All right.

216
00:21:18.236 --> 00:21:20.613
Aah...

217
00:21:20.738 --> 00:21:23.115
Don't sneeze, Ferdie.

218
00:21:23.199 --> 00:21:26.035
- Just hold your breath.
- Ahhh...

219
00:21:36.838 --> 00:21:41.843
Ah- choo!

220
00:22:24.719 --> 00:22:28.556
It was my mistake. I was
trying to loosen things up a little.

221
00:22:28.639 --> 00:22:31.184
But, no. Today proves
that it doesn't work.

222
00:22:31.309 --> 00:22:33.519
From now on,
we'll all respect the rules.

223
00:22:33.644 --> 00:22:35.521
To each creature
its own destiny.

224
00:22:35.646 --> 00:22:38.149
Every animal
in its proper place.

225
00:22:38.232 --> 00:22:42.653
And a pig's proper place is under
the old cart, not in the barn.

226
00:22:42.737 --> 00:22:45.573
And absolutely never
in the house.

227
00:22:45.656 --> 00:22:48.451
- Is that understood?
- Yes, sir.

228
00:22:48.493 --> 00:22:52.747
Now, Pig, regarding the company
you keep. Being young,

229
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:55.583
it's hard to discriminate,
so I'll make it easy for you.

230
00:22:55.666 --> 00:22:59.212
I forbid you to talk to
or consort with...

231
00:22:59.295 --> 00:23:02.006
that duck... ever.

232
00:23:02.089 --> 00:23:07.053
- Have I made myself clear?
- Uh... what's "consort"?

233
00:23:07.136 --> 00:23:09.222
It means, young man,

234
00:23:09.305 --> 00:23:12.767
that you must not go
anywhere near that duck.

235
00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:15.853
As for the fugitive duck, when
he shows himself, let him know this:

236
00:23:15.937 --> 00:23:20.233
Being a duck he must behave like a duck.
No more of this crowing and nonsense.

237
00:23:20.316 --> 00:23:23.694
He should accept what he is
and be thankful for it.

238
00:23:23.736 --> 00:23:26.572
- That goes for all of us.
- Here, here!

239
00:23:26.656 --> 00:23:31.202
Rex continued long into the night.

240
00:23:31.244 --> 00:23:33.454
Elsewhere,
there was more talk.

241
00:23:33.538 --> 00:23:36.332
The subject
was Christmas dinner...

242
00:23:36.374 --> 00:23:39.710
and whether that year the main course
would be roast pork...

243
00:23:39.794 --> 00:23:43.047
or Duck a I'Orange.

244
00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:45.174
And pork is
a nice, sweet meat.

245
00:23:45.299 --> 00:23:49.011
Then there's the crackling.
That always adds interest and texture.

246
00:23:51.806 --> 00:23:55.351
Get him!

247
00:23:55.434 --> 00:23:58.312
Get the pig! Get the pig!
Get the pig!

248
00:23:58.354 --> 00:24:00.314
Get him! Get him!

249
00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:29.677
- Psst!
- Ferdinand!

250
00:24:29.719 --> 00:24:32.054
- Everyone's been looking for you.
- Shh. Shh.

251
00:24:32.096 --> 00:24:35.099
- What is this place?
- What's happenin' out there?

252
00:24:35.183 --> 00:24:39.604
Rex isn't very happy.
Boy, all these new rules!

253
00:24:39.687 --> 00:24:41.606
I'm not allowed to...
Oops.

254
00:24:41.689 --> 00:24:43.691
Not allowed to what?

255
00:24:43.733 --> 00:24:46.611
Huh?

256
00:24:46.694 --> 00:24:51.073
- Piggy!
- What? You didn't see me, all right?

257
00:24:51.199 --> 00:24:55.328
And I didn't see you.
All right? Oops.

258
00:25:30.029 --> 00:25:33.199
The time comes for all creatures...

259
00:25:33.241 --> 00:25:35.201
when childhood ends...

260
00:25:35.243 --> 00:25:39.914
and the doorway opens
to life as an adult.

261
00:25:39.956 --> 00:25:42.917
And so it was
with Fly's pups.

262
00:25:45.753 --> 00:25:51.259
Though that time
was all too soon for Fly.

263
00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:54.887
Puppy, puppy, puppy.
Come on.

264
00:26:11.696 --> 00:26:14.031
In my pocket.

265
00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:05.124
Fly?

266
00:27:05.166 --> 00:27:08.044
May I call you Mom?

267
00:27:14.425 --> 00:27:16.594
And so it was that the pig...

268
00:27:16.719 --> 00:27:20.389
found his place
in the world of the farm.

269
00:27:20.515 --> 00:27:24.977
And he was happy,
even in his dreams.

270
00:27:49.293 --> 00:27:52.839
- Hello!
- Folks, how are you? Merry Christmas!

271
00:27:54.966 --> 00:27:57.510
How's my favorite girl?

272
00:27:57.593 --> 00:28:00.638
Nanny's got
a jellybean.

273
00:28:00.721 --> 00:28:02.723
Give us a kiss.

274
00:28:02.807 --> 00:28:05.434
Guess what we're having
for Christmas dinner.

275
00:28:05.476 --> 00:28:08.688
- Roast pork.
- I hate pork.

276
00:28:08.771 --> 00:28:11.816
Darn silly carry-on,
if you ask me.

277
00:28:11.858 --> 00:28:15.444
The cats says
they call it Christmas.

278
00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:19.782
Christmas!
Christmas dinner, yeah.

279
00:28:19.907 --> 00:28:22.243
Dinner means death.

280
00:28:22.368 --> 00:28:26.831
Death means carnage!
Christmas means carnage!

281
00:28:26.914 --> 00:28:28.916
Christmas means carnage!

282
00:28:41.554 --> 00:28:43.514
Oooh.

283
00:28:48.978 --> 00:28:51.647
Yes!

284
00:28:56.235 --> 00:28:58.029
Wait.

285
00:28:58.112 --> 00:29:02.325
Eatin' pigs!
Blaah! Barbarians!

286
00:29:02.408 --> 00:29:04.869
You're goin' back
to the fields, Maa.

287
00:29:04.952 --> 00:29:07.955
Oh, young'un, tragic there
ain't more of your kind.

288
00:29:07.997 --> 00:29:11.501
- I'll be thinkin' of ya always.
- I could come visit you.

289
00:29:11.584 --> 00:29:14.378
I'd like that, but...

290
00:29:14.462 --> 00:29:17.256
Well, we shouldn't hope
for too much. Ooh!

291
00:29:37.151 --> 00:29:40.029
And so, it was Christmas Eve.

292
00:29:40.112 --> 00:29:42.990
And time had run out
for the pig.

293
00:29:43.674 --> 00:29:47.428
- Are you doing him tonight then?
- Mmm.

294
00:29:47.511 --> 00:29:50.722
Good.
The blood'll drain by morning.

295
00:29:51.598 --> 00:29:54.393
- Pity.
- What's that?

296
00:29:54.476 --> 00:29:56.186
Nothin'.

297
00:29:56.228 --> 00:29:58.647
What on earth
are you babbling on about?

298
00:30:02.443 --> 00:30:05.946
Shame to miss out on the best ham prize
at next year's fair, is all.

299
00:30:07.429 --> 00:30:11.392
Nice plump haunches
he's gettin'.

300
00:30:11.475 --> 00:30:14.770
Beautiful.
Still...

301
00:30:14.812 --> 00:30:17.398
silly to wait,
I suppose.

302
00:31:30.471 --> 00:31:32.473
Here it is!

303
00:31:32.515 --> 00:31:34.646
- The bird.
- Yuck. Chicken?

304
00:31:34.846 --> 00:31:36.978
No,
it's Duck a I'Orange.

305
00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:39.397
And, Mother, it looks
absolutely superb.

306
00:31:39.481 --> 00:31:42.442
- I'm not going to eat any of it!
- This is fabulous.

307
00:31:42.526 --> 00:31:44.569
Ferdinand!

308
00:31:44.694 --> 00:31:48.615
If you're out here,
who's that in there?

309
00:31:48.698 --> 00:31:52.035
Her name's Rosanna.

310
00:31:58.041 --> 00:32:00.544
Why Rosanna?

311
00:32:00.627 --> 00:32:05.423
- She had such a beautiful nature.
- Oh, Ferdinand.

312
00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:07.051
- I can't take it anymore.
- Really!

313
00:32:07.134 --> 00:32:12.348
The fear's too much for a duck.
It eats away at the soul.

314
00:32:12.389 --> 00:32:16.643
There must be kinder dispositions
in far- off gentler lands.

315
00:32:16.685 --> 00:32:19.021
The only way you'll find
happiness is to accept...

316
00:32:19.063 --> 00:32:22.524
that the way things are
is the way things are.

317
00:32:22.566 --> 00:32:25.694
The way things are stinks!
I'm not gonna be a goner. I'm gone.

318
00:32:25.736 --> 00:32:27.863
I wish all of you
the best of luck.

319
00:32:28.946 --> 00:32:30.800
- Where will you go?
- No idea.

320
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.169
But I'm a clever duck.
I could do with an adventure.

321
00:32:33.211 --> 00:32:37.548
- I'll miss you, Ferdie.
- Ferdie? No one's ever called me that before.

322
00:32:37.632 --> 00:32:39.926
Hey, good luck, Pig.
Huh?

323
00:32:40.009 --> 00:32:42.345
- I am outta here.
- Bye, bye.

324
00:32:43.628 --> 00:32:47.924
Ow!
Would you do me a favor, old thing?

325
00:32:48.008 --> 00:32:50.844
- Anything.
- Open the gate, huh?

326
00:32:54.598 --> 00:32:58.351
Ah! Ah! Ahh!
Ha-ha-ha! Whoa!

327
00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:13.241
The pig knew it was
against the rules to leave the farm.

328
00:33:13.325 --> 00:33:17.370
But something
was definitely wrong.

329
00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:25.670
How lovely, darling.
What is it?

330
00:33:25.712 --> 00:33:29.424
It's a fax machine.
You can send us letters by phone.

331
00:33:29.508 --> 00:33:32.302
- Hmm.
- Oh.

332
00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:41.102
At any other time,
the pig would've been tickled pink...

333
00:33:41.186 --> 00:33:43.480
by his first visit
to the sheep fields.

334
00:33:43.563 --> 00:33:45.815
But now
there was fear in the air.

335
00:33:45.899 --> 00:33:50.570
Maa and her kind
were under threat.

336
00:34:04.202 --> 00:34:06.595
Hey, Frank, feel like pork
for dinner tonight?

337
00:34:06.796 --> 00:34:08.673
- Young'un, you're alive!
- Maa!

338
00:34:10.091 --> 00:34:12.093
What's happening?
Who are these men?

339
00:34:12.218 --> 00:34:14.762
I'll get him out. Come around, Sniff!

340
00:34:17.723 --> 00:34:19.809
Where's our boss?
It doesn't seem right.

341
00:34:32.237 --> 00:34:36.367
- What's wrong, dear?
- It's the wrong one!

342
00:34:36.408 --> 00:34:39.536
I want the house I saw
on the television!

343
00:34:39.578 --> 00:34:41.538
Oh, there, there.

344
00:35:09.817 --> 00:35:12.903
Get! Quick! Get the dog in.

345
00:35:14.697 --> 00:35:16.907
Out of the sheep!
Come on!

346
00:35:18.649 --> 00:35:20.609
Let's go!

347
00:35:54.945 --> 00:35:57.697
Good dog.

348
00:36:01.993 --> 00:36:03.954
Good pig.

349
00:36:27.477 --> 00:36:30.063
Oooh.

350
00:36:36.444 --> 00:36:40.949
Oooh!

351
00:36:40.991 --> 00:36:45.620
- Hey, hey. Dad says his little porker's a watch pig.
- Dearie me!

352
00:36:45.662 --> 00:36:48.832
If it's not a duck
that thinks it's a rooster,

353
00:36:48.915 --> 00:36:53.461
it's a pig that thinks it's a dog!

354
00:36:53.545 --> 00:36:56.423
A pig that thinks
it's a dog!

355
00:37:14.482 --> 00:37:18.862
A pig that thinks it's a dog!

356
00:37:23.408 --> 00:37:27.662
A washing machine,
a radio, a new alarm clock.

357
00:37:27.746 --> 00:37:31.958
I think it's a lovely fax machine,
darling, but can't you use it?

358
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.129
We already have one, Mom.
That's the whole idea.

359
00:37:36.254 --> 00:37:38.840
We can send faxes
to each other.

360
00:37:38.965 --> 00:37:41.885
Don't be afraid of it
just because it's new.

361
00:37:41.968 --> 00:37:44.221
These accounts are
a real worry, Arthur.

362
00:37:44.346 --> 00:37:47.098
Every month your expenditure
is greater than your income.

363
00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:49.559
It's eating up your reserves.

364
00:37:49.643 --> 00:37:52.646
You need to modernize, get
some sort of cash flow going.

365
00:37:52.687 --> 00:37:55.857
You're still using
a horse and cart, for God's sakes.

366
00:37:57.567 --> 00:37:59.820
- Dad?
- Funny, that.

367
00:37:59.861 --> 00:38:04.491
- What?
- Those chickens, that pig.

368
00:38:04.533 --> 00:38:08.662
What's the pig
got to do with anything?

369
00:38:08.703 --> 00:38:11.164
Nothing.

370
00:38:11.206 --> 00:38:15.001
Just look at them.
The browns and the whites.

371
00:38:39.568 --> 00:38:41.945
Come, Rex.
Come, Fly.

372
00:38:44.197 --> 00:38:46.158
Come, Pig.

373
00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:50.952
Come, Pig!

374
00:38:55.666 --> 00:38:58.447
Perhaps he's pleased
with you for what you did yesterday.

375
00:38:58.791 --> 00:39:01.375
- I didn't do much.
- If it wasn't for you, dear,

376
00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:02.684
they could've stolen
the whole flock.

377
00:39:03.553 --> 00:39:06.837
- Is Rex unhappy with me?
- Oh, he'll be all right.

378
00:39:07.299 --> 00:39:09.752
Just stay out
of his way today.

379
00:39:15.028 --> 00:39:17.906
Way to be, Fly.
Rex, come by.

380
00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:56.444
That'll do.

381
00:40:00.123 --> 00:40:04.252
You're so quick.
I'd never be able to fly like you can.

382
00:40:04.335 --> 00:40:06.796
Pigs aren't built
to fly, dear.

383
00:40:06.879 --> 00:40:09.590
But speed isn't the thing.
It's attitude.

384
00:40:09.632 --> 00:40:11.884
They just have to know
who's boss.

385
00:40:24.397 --> 00:40:26.357
Out you go.

386
00:40:39.537 --> 00:40:42.165
Mmm!

387
00:41:10.025 --> 00:41:11.105
Get 'em up, Pig.

388
00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:15.805
- He wants you to drive them out of the yard.
- Away to me, Pig.

389
00:41:16.188 --> 00:41:17.744
Remember, you have
to dominate them.

390
00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:20.155
Do that and they'll do
anything you want. Go.

391
00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:25.040
Woof!

392
00:41:25.124 --> 00:41:27.293
Woof, woof, woof!

393
00:41:27.334 --> 00:41:29.837
Woof! Woof!
Woof, woof, woof, woof!

394
00:41:34.883 --> 00:41:36.885
Woof, woof, woof!

395
00:41:44.518 --> 00:41:46.770
This is ridiculous,
Mom.

396
00:41:46.854 --> 00:41:49.106
Nonsense.
It's only your first try.

397
00:41:49.189 --> 00:41:51.900
But you're treating them like equals.
They're sheep. They're inferior.

398
00:41:51.984 --> 00:41:55.154
- Ah, no they're not.
- Of course they are!

399
00:41:55.195 --> 00:41:57.822
We are their masters. Let them doubt it
for a second and they'll walk all over you.

400
00:41:58.116 --> 00:42:02.465
- Fly, get that pig out of there.
- Make them feel inferior. Abuse them. Insult them.

401
00:42:03.103 --> 00:42:04.626
- But they'll laugh at me.
- Then bite them.

402
00:42:05.348 --> 00:42:07.995
Be ruthless. Whatever it takes.
Bend them to your will.

403
00:42:08.135 --> 00:42:09.931
- Enough!
- Go on! Go!

404
00:42:17.018 --> 00:42:19.980
Move along there, you...

405
00:42:20.063 --> 00:42:22.065
You, uh,
big butt heads!

406
00:42:27.821 --> 00:42:31.575
- Ow!
- Young'un, stop this nonsense.

407
00:42:31.658 --> 00:42:35.954
What's got into you? I just finished
tellin' what a nice young pig you be.

408
00:42:35.996 --> 00:42:38.749
Maa, I was just trying
to be a sheepdog.

409
00:42:38.832 --> 00:42:41.334
Hah! Enough wolves
in the world already...

410
00:42:41.376 --> 00:42:43.962
without a nice lad like you
turnin' nasty.

411
00:42:44.004 --> 00:42:46.006
You haven't got it in ya,
young'un.

412
00:42:53.036 --> 00:42:55.936
You and I are descended
from the great sheepdogs.

413
00:42:56.583 --> 00:42:58.667
We carry the bloodline
of the Ancient Bahou.

414
00:42:59.574 --> 00:43:00.910
We stand for something.

415
00:43:01.259 --> 00:43:03.884
And today I watched in shame
as all that was betrayed.

416
00:43:04.069 --> 00:43:08.040
- Rex, he's just a little pig.
- All the greater the insult.

417
00:43:10.763 --> 00:43:14.392
I'm sorry I bit you.
Are you all right?

418
00:43:14.434 --> 00:43:18.813
I wouldn't call that a bite, myself. You
got teeth in that floppy mouth or just gums?

419
00:43:22.317 --> 00:43:25.695
You see, ladies,
a heart of gold.

420
00:43:25.778 --> 00:43:28.865
Ahh. Heart of gold.

421
00:43:28.948 --> 00:43:31.534
No need for all this
wolf nonsense, young'un.

422
00:43:31.576 --> 00:43:35.497
All a nice little pig like you
need do is ask.

423
00:44:07.529 --> 00:44:10.156
Thanks very much.
It was very kind of you.

424
00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:12.492
- A pleasure.
- What a nice little pig!

425
00:44:19.999 --> 00:44:22.043
All right,
how did you do it?

426
00:44:22.127 --> 00:44:24.879
I asked them, and they did it.
I asked them nicely.

427
00:44:24.963 --> 00:44:27.507
We don't ask sheep, dear.
We tell them what to do.

428
00:44:27.590 --> 00:44:30.510
I did, Mom.
They were really friendly.

429
00:44:30.635 --> 00:44:35.014
Maybe Rex might be a little more
friendly if I had a talk with him.

430
00:44:35.098 --> 00:44:39.144
No, no, no.
You better leave that to me.

431
00:45:03.293 --> 00:45:04.752
Rex?

432
00:45:07.672 --> 00:45:10.633
I know it was hard
for you today...

433
00:45:10.758 --> 00:45:12.802
watching all that happening.

434
00:45:12.927 --> 00:45:16.097
But surely it's not worth
all this misery.

435
00:45:16.222 --> 00:45:20.018
Please, dear,
not on such a beautiful night.

436
00:45:20.143 --> 00:45:22.812
You put these ideas
into his head!

437
00:45:22.896 --> 00:45:25.565
Two-faced traitorous wret...

438
00:45:32.739 --> 00:45:35.241
Get down!

439
00:45:35.366 --> 00:45:38.203
Down, Rex.
Fly!

440
00:46:01.684 --> 00:46:05.146
A dark cloud
had descended on the valley.

441
00:46:05.271 --> 00:46:08.274
And the pig felt that
the troubles were all his fault.

442
00:46:08.399 --> 00:46:12.612
But he was certain that he knew
how to put things right again.

443
00:46:12.737 --> 00:46:16.199
Oh, uh,
e-excuse me, sir.

444
00:46:18.368 --> 00:46:20.620
But I-I-I think
all this trouble...

445
00:46:27.836 --> 00:46:31.297
Well, it's not distemper.
Can't be rabies.

446
00:46:31.422 --> 00:46:33.967
Must be the hormones.

447
00:46:34.092 --> 00:46:38.930
- What about Hoggett's notion, the dog jealous of the wee pig?
- I don't see that myself.

448
00:46:39.055 --> 00:46:42.100
No. So what should we do?

449
00:46:42.225 --> 00:46:46.646
You can keep him locked up
or... snip, snip. I can do it Tuesday.

450
00:46:46.729 --> 00:46:48.982
No.

451
00:46:49.065 --> 00:46:50.525
Or Wednesday.

452
00:46:50.650 --> 00:46:54.404
Hoggett doesn't want the dog
operated on. He's a breeding dog.

453
00:46:54.529 --> 00:46:56.865
I can sedate him,
of course,

454
00:46:56.990 --> 00:47:00.285
but he'll be useless
as a working dog.

455
00:47:07.167 --> 00:47:11.713
I'll give you pills to put in his food.

456
00:47:11.838 --> 00:47:14.632
Good dog.

457
00:47:17.385 --> 00:47:21.306
The Sheep Pig.

458
00:47:42.702 --> 00:47:46.247
A pig doing the work of a sheepdog?

459
00:47:46.372 --> 00:47:51.002
With Rex out of action and Fly injured from
the fight, Farmer Hoggett had no choice.

460
00:47:51.085 --> 00:47:55.256
Maa! Maa! The boss has
to give you some medicine.

461
00:47:55.381 --> 00:47:58.926
Oh, dear, I thought so!
It's horrible stuff, that.

462
00:47:59.051 --> 00:48:04.390
- I know, but it's for the best.
- Young'un, if you say so.

463
00:48:19.802 --> 00:48:20.801
Shoo! Shoo!

464
00:48:20.836 --> 00:48:22.592
When the thought first came to him,

465
00:48:22.817 --> 00:48:25.801
Farmer Hoggett dismissed it
as mere whimsy.

466
00:48:26.345 --> 00:48:30.255
But, like most of his harebrained
ideas, it wouldn't go away.

467
00:48:36.898 --> 00:48:39.788
- What are they doing?
- It's a sheepdog trial.

468
00:48:40.241 --> 00:48:42.601
So it's like
a competition for sheepdogs?

469
00:48:43.015 --> 00:48:45.607
And their bosses.
It's like an obstacle course.

470
00:48:45.707 --> 00:48:47.464
How do they decide
who wins?

471
00:48:47.833 --> 00:48:51.430
It's time and mistakes.
You get points for how quick you are.

472
00:48:51.735 --> 00:48:53.477
And they take points off
for every mistake.

473
00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:57.626
Every time a sheep goes the wrong way,
that's a mistake and you lose points.

474
00:48:58.387 --> 00:49:02.495
- Looks like fun!
- For a sheepdog, there's no prouder moment.

475
00:49:03.338 --> 00:49:06.353
- Rex and I used to...
- Hmm?

476
00:49:08.078 --> 00:49:09.651
Never mind.

477
00:49:09.847 --> 00:49:12.684
Oh.

478
00:49:14.067 --> 00:49:15.568
Was Rex a champion?

479
00:49:15.741 --> 00:49:20.929
He had the makings of the greatest
champion there ever was, but it wasn't to be.

480
00:49:21.029 --> 00:49:25.322
- What happened?
- A while back when Rex was in his prime,

481
00:49:25.542 --> 00:49:28.479
the winter rains brought
a great flood to the valley.

482
00:49:29.578 --> 00:49:32.388
Rex and the boss got most of
the flock onto the high ground.

483
00:49:32.995 --> 00:49:35.091
Then Rex went back
to look for the strays.

484
00:49:35.716 --> 00:49:39.344
He found them. They'd been
stranded by the rising water.

485
00:49:40.929 --> 00:49:45.350
He tried to herd them across
to safety, but they wouldn't budge.

486
00:49:45.434 --> 00:49:49.396
Too afraid and too stupid
to save their own skins.

487
00:49:49.521 --> 00:49:53.066
It was freezing cold
and the water kept rising.

488
00:49:53.192 --> 00:49:57.404
Rex stayed with them
right through the night.

489
00:49:57.529 --> 00:50:00.782
By morning,
the sheep were drowned.

490
00:50:00.908 --> 00:50:05.871
- And when they found Rex, he was barely alive.
- Oh, Mom!

491
00:50:05.996 --> 00:50:09.333
Two weeks rest in front of
the fire saw him back on his feet.

492
00:50:09.416 --> 00:50:12.336
But his hearing
was never the same again.

493
00:50:12.419 --> 00:50:17.466
He'd never want anyone to know,
but he's almost totally deaf.

494
00:50:17.591 --> 00:50:22.221
- Is that why he's so, you know, angry?
- That's not the half of it.

495
00:50:22.304 --> 00:50:26.099
All this was barely a month
before the Grand National Challenge.

496
00:50:26.225 --> 00:50:30.521
He tried his best, but he couldn't hear
the boss's calls, and it slowed him up.

497
00:50:30.604 --> 00:50:34.233
The cold truth is that,
but for the stupidity of sheep,

498
00:50:34.358 --> 00:50:38.111
Rex would've been
the champion of champions.

499
00:50:42.241 --> 00:50:44.117
Good dog.

500
00:51:10.352 --> 00:51:13.063
That's it, all right.
Good.

501
00:51:13.146 --> 00:51:16.483
Here we go. All right.

502
00:51:16.608 --> 00:51:19.570
Now, through here like this.

503
00:51:19.653 --> 00:51:22.114
And then, big hook to the left.
Big hook.

504
00:51:22.197 --> 00:51:26.285
Big hook.
Through this gate here.

505
00:51:26.368 --> 00:51:31.248
It was at that time that Mrs.
Hoggett began to worry about her husband.

506
00:51:31.331 --> 00:51:36.211
But Farmer Hoggett knew
that little ideas...

507
00:51:36.336 --> 00:51:39.464
that tickled and nagged
and refused to go away...

508
00:51:39.548 --> 00:51:42.092
should never be ignored...

509
00:51:42.175 --> 00:51:45.804
for in them lie
the seeds of destiny.

510
00:51:45.888 --> 00:51:49.183
Close the gate like that,
and you're done.

511
00:51:52.186 --> 00:51:54.980
A Tragic Day.

512
00:52:09.369 --> 00:52:14.124
Mom. Mom!
Can we start work early today?

513
00:52:14.249 --> 00:52:17.169
Oh, dear,
it's not even dawn yet.

514
00:52:17.294 --> 00:52:23.133
You can go to work when the rooster
crows. Oh, go back to sleep.

515
00:52:32.082 --> 00:52:34.042
Ahem.

516
00:52:34.126 --> 00:52:35.322
Um, excuse me.

517
00:52:35.987 --> 00:52:39.991
Hello, sir. Excuse me,
but it's nearly dawn, and...

518
00:52:40.116 --> 00:52:43.453
- What?
- Sorry to disturb you.

519
00:52:43.537 --> 00:52:47.707
It's nearly dawn, and I wondered if you'd mind
crowing just a few minutes early this morning.

520
00:52:47.833 --> 00:52:49.709
- Get out of here!
- But, well, see I...

521
00:52:49.835 --> 00:52:52.629
- Get lost!
- Oh, okay.

522
00:52:54.965 --> 00:52:57.884
Whoa!

523
00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:47.642
Now the pig understood
why the sheep called all dogs wolves.

524
00:53:47.726 --> 00:53:51.605
And he was filled with
a deep and terrible rage.

525
00:54:20.258 --> 00:54:22.260
Maa! Maa!

526
00:54:22.385 --> 00:54:25.555
- Are you all right?
- Hello, young'un.

527
00:54:25.639 --> 00:54:28.016
Oh, Maa,
can you get up?

528
00:54:28.099 --> 00:54:30.769
I don't reckon.

529
00:54:30.811 --> 00:54:35.232
It's over, Maa.
The wolves have gone far away.

530
00:54:35.315 --> 00:54:38.527
I'll get the boss up here
to look after you.

531
00:54:38.610 --> 00:54:42.531
You'll be all right. You'll be all right!

532
00:54:43.740 --> 00:54:47.911
Oh, Maa! Maa!

533
00:54:48.036 --> 00:54:53.083
Maa! Maa!

534
00:54:53.166 --> 00:54:55.126
Maa!

535
00:54:55.252 --> 00:54:59.339
Maa!

536
00:55:17.899 --> 00:55:19.901
Home, Pig.

537
00:55:23.330 --> 00:55:26.416
Fly knew that there
was only one fate for any creature...

538
00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:30.170
that took the life of a sheep
on Hoggett Farm.

539
00:55:47.828 --> 00:55:52.374
But Fly could never believe
that Babe was a sheep killer,

540
00:55:52.457 --> 00:55:58.130
so she remained in the field to do something
she'd never done before: talk to the sheep.

541
00:55:58.255 --> 00:56:01.008
Tell me.
Who killed the old one?

542
00:56:01.133 --> 00:56:04.845
Wolf!
- Wolf. Is that the only words you half- wits know?

543
00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:07.848
- Wolf!
- Are you saying it was a dog?

544
00:56:07.973 --> 00:56:11.476
- Where's Babe?
- Was it wolf or Babe?

545
00:56:11.602 --> 00:56:16.773
Wolf! Babe!

546
00:56:17.609 --> 00:56:21.279
Farmer Hoggett was carrying
something in the crook of one arm.

547
00:56:21.363 --> 00:56:23.824
A kind of black, shiny tube.

548
00:56:26.088 --> 00:56:27.285
Come, Pig.

549
00:56:27.869 --> 00:56:31.956
The pig had a vague
memory that shiny tubes produced food,

550
00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:35.293
and guessed that some
quite unexpected surprise...

551
00:56:35.418 --> 00:56:37.526
would come out
of two small round mouths.

552
00:56:38.271 --> 00:56:41.191
Babe! Wolf!

553
00:56:41.274 --> 00:56:45.028
Babe! Wolf!

554
00:56:45.111 --> 00:56:48.323
Quiet!

555
00:56:48.448 --> 00:56:50.784
Fly decided to speak very slowly,

556
00:56:50.909 --> 00:56:54.871
for it was a cold fact of nature
that sheep were stupid...

557
00:56:54.955 --> 00:56:56.915
and no one would ever
persuade her otherwise.

558
00:56:57.040 --> 00:57:01.169
Please, please
would you be...

559
00:57:01.253 --> 00:57:04.631
so kind as to tell me
what happened?

560
00:57:04.714 --> 00:57:06.007
Quiet!

561
00:57:06.091 --> 00:57:09.845
Please, tell me
what happened this morning.

562
00:57:09.928 --> 00:57:14.015
The sheep spoke very slowly...

563
00:57:14.140 --> 00:57:16.810
for it was a cold fact of nature
that wolves were ignorant...

564
00:57:16.893 --> 00:57:19.354
and nothing would
convince them otherwise.

565
00:57:19.479 --> 00:57:22.899
Babe came!
He saved us!

566
00:57:23.024 --> 00:57:28.029
- The wolves killed Maa.
- But Babe drove the wolves away!

567
00:57:28.113 --> 00:57:31.825
Thank you! Thank you!
Thank you all very much!

568
00:57:31.908 --> 00:57:35.871
Pleasure talkin' to ya.

569
00:58:03.297 --> 00:58:08.010
Hooey! Hoggett!
Hooey! Arthur!

570
00:58:10.721 --> 00:58:13.001
Oh, there you are!
Well, what do you think?

571
00:58:13.433 --> 00:58:16.477
That was the police on the telephone.
Said there are wild dogs about.

572
00:58:16.603 --> 00:58:19.522
Apparently the Mitchells
lost six lambs this morning.

573
00:58:19.647 --> 00:58:21.983
What are you doing
with that gun?

574
00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:27.655
Oh, I...Nothing.

575
00:58:48.443 --> 00:58:52.697
Pig of Destiny!

576
00:59:00.103 --> 00:59:03.523
It's all very simple.
Half an hour at 350 degrees.

577
00:59:03.649 --> 00:59:05.390
I've given you
rabbit casserole for Friday.

578
00:59:05.644 --> 00:59:08.605
Now, for Duchess, it's liver
in the morning, heart for the evening.

579
00:59:08.730 --> 00:59:11.900
Except Fridays, when it's steak in
the morning, and cooked liver at night.

580
00:59:12.025 --> 00:59:18.073
Warm it up a bit but test it, because she
bites into it before she knows what's what.

581
00:59:18.198 --> 00:59:20.200
That'll be the bus.

582
00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:28.041
- Oh, bye, bye.
- Have a good time. Bye.

583
00:59:28.166 --> 00:59:30.710
Hello, everyone!

584
00:59:36.383 --> 00:59:38.510
Oh, dearie me, Valda.

585
00:59:38.593 --> 00:59:40.762
I know I have to be
at the National Conference.

586
00:59:40.887 --> 00:59:44.057
I am the Assistant General Secretary
of the Northeast Region after all,

587
00:59:44.182 --> 00:59:47.811
but I do worry about
leaving that man alone.

588
00:59:47.936 --> 00:59:51.690
- Still acting a bit strange?
- Just silly things.

589
00:59:51.773 --> 00:59:54.859
Odd little things
only a wife would notice.

590
00:59:54.943 --> 01:00:00.282
- Still, he can't get up to too much mischief in three days.
- Of course not.

591
01:00:13.527 --> 01:00:16.822
Go on.

592
01:00:18.115 --> 01:00:19.658
Go on!

593
01:00:33.439 --> 01:00:37.401
Oh! Good evening. Shame about the weather.

594
01:00:37.485 --> 01:00:38.698
Nasty cough!

595
01:00:42.357 --> 01:00:44.567
It had been
a long time since Arthur Hoggett...

596
01:00:44.692 --> 01:00:48.988
had had an animal in whose abilities
he had so much faith.

597
01:00:50.907 --> 01:00:54.869
And with the National Grand Challenge
Sheepdog Trials only two days away,

598
01:00:54.994 --> 01:00:58.623
he wasn't going to let the fact
that his animal was a pig deter him.

599
01:01:00.834 --> 01:01:03.920
He had been worried,
for he was a truthful man,

600
01:01:04.045 --> 01:01:07.048
that the heading might say
"Name of dog."

601
01:01:07.173 --> 01:01:09.509
And then whatever he put
would be a lie.

602
01:01:09.592 --> 01:01:14.848
But as it happened, luck,
for the moment, was running with him.

603
01:01:23.031 --> 01:01:24.991
It's all right, really!

604
01:01:25.116 --> 01:01:28.703
I'm just, well... Bless you.

605
01:02:16.835 --> 01:02:21.464
Whoa, whoa!
Uh, easy, whoa! Ah.

606
01:02:21.548 --> 01:02:23.466
Oh, no.

607
01:02:23.550 --> 01:02:27.679
- So, ah... what's happening?
- Oh, no.

608
01:02:31.224 --> 01:02:33.018
Shh. Easy, easy.

609
01:02:33.101 --> 01:02:35.895
- Good pig. Good pig.
- Huh? Huh?

610
01:02:37.188 --> 01:02:40.483
Hold still.
Hold still.

611
01:02:40.567 --> 01:02:44.529
Huh?

612
01:02:47.866 --> 01:02:50.410
There are many
perfectly nice cats in the world.

613
01:02:50.493 --> 01:02:53.079
But every barrel
has its bad apples.

614
01:02:53.163 --> 01:02:55.540
And it is well to heed
the old adage,

615
01:02:55.665 --> 01:03:00.128
"Beware the bad cat
bearing a grudge."

616
01:04:22.919 --> 01:04:25.839
- How are you feeling?
- A bit tired.

617
01:04:25.922 --> 01:04:28.883
You'll need a good sleep to put you
in top condition tomorrow.

618
01:04:29.009 --> 01:04:31.386
Don't stay up too late.
Good night.

619
01:04:31.469 --> 01:04:34.556
Good night, Mom.

620
01:04:42.981 --> 01:04:46.693
Oh, do forgive me
for scratching you, dear.

621
01:04:46.776 --> 01:04:51.531
I got a bit carried away.
It's a cat thing.

622
01:04:51.615 --> 01:04:55.118
Oh. Well...
But oh...

623
01:04:55.243 --> 01:04:58.496
Feeling good about tomorrow,
are you?

624
01:04:58.622 --> 01:05:01.124
Mm-hmm. It should be all right,
I think.

625
01:05:01.249 --> 01:05:06.755
I probably shouldn't say this,
but I'm not sure if you realize...

626
01:05:06.838 --> 01:05:11.426
how much the other animals are laughing
at you for this sheepdog business.

627
01:05:11.551 --> 01:05:13.595
Why would they do that?

628
01:05:13.678 --> 01:05:18.558
Well, they say that you've forgotten
that you're a pig. Isn't that silly?

629
01:05:18.642 --> 01:05:22.228
They even say that you
don't know what pigs are for.

630
01:05:22.312 --> 01:05:24.272
What do you mean?

631
01:05:24.356 --> 01:05:29.110
- You know... why pigs are here.
- Why are any of us here?

632
01:05:29.235 --> 01:05:31.905
Well, the cow's here
to be milked.

633
01:05:32.030 --> 01:05:34.908
The dogs are here to help
the boss's husband with the sheep.

634
01:05:35.033 --> 01:05:38.203
And I'm here to be beautiful
and affectionate to the boss.

635
01:05:38.286 --> 01:05:40.538
Yes?

636
01:05:40.622 --> 01:05:45.043
The fact is that pigs
don't have a purpose.

637
01:05:45.126 --> 01:05:48.046
Just like ducks
don't have a purpose.

638
01:05:48.129 --> 01:05:52.759
I don't...
- All right, for you own sake, I'll be blunt.

639
01:05:52.842 --> 01:05:57.264
Why do the bosses keep ducks?
To eat them.

640
01:05:57.347 --> 01:06:00.725
So why do the bosses
keep a pig?

641
01:06:00.809 --> 01:06:06.398
The fact is that animals that don't seem
to have a purpose really do have a purpose.

642
01:06:06.481 --> 01:06:10.986
The bosses have to eat. It's probably
the most noble purpose of all...

643
01:06:11.111 --> 01:06:13.280
when you come
to think about it.

644
01:06:13.363 --> 01:06:15.282
They eat pigs?

645
01:06:15.407 --> 01:06:19.035
Pork, they call it.
Or bacon.

646
01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:21.830
They only call them pigs
when they're alive.

647
01:06:21.913 --> 01:06:24.249
But, uh, I'm a sheep pig!

648
01:06:26.167 --> 01:06:29.045
The boss's husband's just
playing a little game with you.

649
01:06:29.170 --> 01:06:32.924
Believe me, sooner or later,
every pig gets eaten.

650
01:06:33.008 --> 01:06:36.636
That's the way
the world works.

651
01:06:36.761 --> 01:06:41.641
Oh! I haven't upset you,
have I?

652
01:07:11.087 --> 01:07:13.340
- Mom?
- Mm-hmm.

653
01:07:13.465 --> 01:07:15.675
- Mom!
- Good heavens!

654
01:07:15.759 --> 01:07:19.346
What on earth are you doing
out in the rain?

655
01:07:19.429 --> 01:07:22.849
You should be looking after yourself
with such a big day ahead of you.

656
01:07:22.974 --> 01:07:26.144
- Are pigs for eatin'?
- Who told you that?

657
01:07:26.227 --> 01:07:29.856
The cat told me. Pigs don't have
a purpose except to be eaten.

658
01:07:29.940 --> 01:07:33.735
Is it true?

659
01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:37.030
It's true.
For many pigs, it's true.

660
01:07:37.113 --> 01:07:39.866
So my mother, my father,
my brothers and my sisters,

661
01:07:39.991 --> 01:07:43.161
- all...
- Probably, dear.

662
01:07:45.789 --> 01:07:49.668
- Do you want to talk about it?
- No, it's all right.

663
01:07:50.752 --> 01:07:54.881
I understand.
I'll be all right.

664
01:07:58.009 --> 01:08:01.721
Even... the boss?

665
01:08:01.805 --> 01:08:04.391
Yes, dear.

666
01:08:27.539 --> 01:08:30.500
Ooh! Ooo!

667
01:08:30.625 --> 01:08:32.961
Babe?

668
01:08:33.044 --> 01:08:34.588
Babe!

669
01:08:34.671 --> 01:08:36.464
Babe!

670
01:08:40.510 --> 01:08:42.679
Babe!

671
01:08:45.098 --> 01:08:46.433
Babe!

672
01:08:49.644 --> 01:08:51.980
Babe's run away.

673
01:08:52.105 --> 01:08:54.316
Rex?

674
01:08:54.482 --> 01:08:56.109
Please?

675
01:08:56.234 --> 01:08:58.778
Call the boss.

676
01:09:22.010 --> 01:09:24.304
He's over here.

677
01:09:24.387 --> 01:09:27.891
Hold on, Pig.
You'll be home soon.

678
01:09:34.856 --> 01:09:38.735
He's got a cold, but that doesn't
explain a pig not eating.

679
01:09:38.860 --> 01:09:42.155
He's got me stonkered, Arthur.
But I can tell you this.

680
01:09:42.239 --> 01:09:46.826
If you don't get fluids into him soon,
you're gonna lose him.

681
01:09:48.510 --> 01:09:50.700
C'mon, son.
Pull yourself together.

682
01:09:51.566 --> 01:09:53.142
The boss needs you.

683
01:10:09.907 --> 01:10:11.993
Here we go.

684
01:10:13.327 --> 01:10:16.247
Come on, Pig.
Ah, come on.

685
01:10:16.330 --> 01:10:18.457
There's my boy.

686
01:10:18.541 --> 01:10:22.503
Come on, then.
Come on.

687
01:12:45.563 --> 01:12:47.732
Listen, Arthur,
I'll tell you what we can do.

688
01:12:47.815 --> 01:12:50.985
You're listed third, but we can
put you last in the program.

689
01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:54.655
However, you must be here by 3:30;
otherwise you'll be disqualified.

690
01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:56.741
All right.

691
01:13:13.132 --> 01:13:17.094
And welcome back to the National Grand
Challenge Sheepdog Trials...

692
01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:20.598
coming today from the Kingsmith Show
Ground in the heart of sheep country.

693
01:13:20.723 --> 01:13:23.184
The weather's been patchy,

694
01:13:23.309 --> 01:13:27.855
but we've already seen some wonderful
work by these talented dogs.

695
01:13:39.033 --> 01:13:40.993
Stay there.

696
01:13:41.077 --> 01:13:43.204
Excuse me, sheep.

697
01:13:44.229 --> 01:13:47.899
Hello! Hello!
Good morning to you all!

698
01:13:50.244 --> 01:13:52.900
I've never met a sheep
with such a strong, dark face.

699
01:13:52.956 --> 01:13:56.098
Are they feeding you well?

700
01:13:56.987 --> 01:13:58.610
Babe, I'll try.

701
01:13:59.127 --> 01:14:03.423
All right, blockheads!
Pay attention over here!

702
01:14:03.549 --> 01:14:07.970
Now, you pay attention
to what this pig has to say...

703
01:14:08.095 --> 01:14:10.552
or I'll come in there
and rip you to shreds!

704
01:14:12.049 --> 01:14:16.471
Hadn't thought of this. Keep talking
to them. I'll see what I can do.

705
01:14:20.725 --> 01:14:25.063
- Doesn't it look a picture? Our show ground on the telly!
- Apart from the weather.

706
01:14:25.146 --> 01:14:29.484
- Look! There's your Bert!
- Bert Ford and Sweep doing very well.

707
01:14:29.609 --> 01:14:34.614
- Sweep's having a little trouble with this gate, Clive.
- A lot of trouble actually.

708
01:14:34.739 --> 01:14:39.202
- That's going to set Bert back.
- Don't worry, Valda. Just a little slipup.

709
01:14:39.327 --> 01:14:41.997
Look, he's doing
much better now.

710
01:14:42.122 --> 01:14:46.126
Too many loose sheep.
And Sweep's usually such a reliable dog.

711
01:14:51.047 --> 01:14:53.300
Hey, whoa.
Stop!

712
01:15:04.561 --> 01:15:08.231
If those sheep won't talk to Babe,
the boss is going to look like an idiot.

713
01:15:08.356 --> 01:15:11.359
- I don't know what to do.
- There is one thing.

714
01:15:11.484 --> 01:15:15.488
I gotta go!
I'll try to be back in time.

715
01:15:21.870 --> 01:15:26.374
Ahem. It must've been
terrible weather for you,

716
01:15:26.499 --> 01:15:31.546
out in the field with all this rain we've been having.

717
01:15:36.016 --> 01:15:38.102
Hey, that dog's
in a hurry.

718
01:15:38.144 --> 01:15:41.564
Come on, Nick,
I got a beer and a TV waiting.

719
01:15:53.824 --> 01:15:58.371
The last entry
is Pig. Owner, A. Hoggett.

720
01:15:58.496 --> 01:16:00.665
- Was that "Hoggett"?
- I think it was!

721
01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:05.711
- Huh?
- He said Hoggett. It was clear as a bell.

722
01:16:05.836 --> 01:16:09.715
Must be another Hoggett. We only have
the two dogs, and they certainly...

723
01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:11.717
aren't...

724
01:16:23.312 --> 01:16:26.107
Wolf! Wolf!

725
01:16:26.190 --> 01:16:27.269
Wolf! Wolf!

726
01:16:27.317 --> 01:16:28.821
Shut up, you morons!

727
01:16:30.029 --> 01:16:31.990
The little pig's in trouble.

728
01:16:32.115 --> 01:16:35.493
What trouble has come
to our Babe, wolf?

729
01:16:35.618 --> 01:16:38.413
The sheep at the trials
won't talk to the little fellow.

730
01:16:38.538 --> 01:16:40.665
They won't listen.
He doesn't know what to do.

731
01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:43.918
Don't know what
we could do to help.

732
01:16:44.043 --> 01:16:48.768
- It's not right to give help to a wolf.
- You wait here, wolf.

733
01:16:49.403 --> 01:16:53.319
You'll have to speak up.
I'm a... little hard of hearing.

734
01:16:53.444 --> 01:16:57.323
I asked you
to wait here, wolf.

735
01:16:57.448 --> 01:17:00.159
Do what you're told
by an old sheep for a change.

736
01:17:00.284 --> 01:17:02.995
We'll see
what we can do for you.

737
01:17:04.288 --> 01:17:07.875
Work completed.
Restore power.

738
01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.540
Very frustrating
to be sitting up here...

739
01:17:12.001 --> 01:17:13.201
wondering
what's causing the delay.

740
01:17:13.297 --> 01:17:16.509
We have someone on their way
to the judges' rooms now.

741
01:17:16.634 --> 01:17:19.304
We'll tell you what's causing
the problem as soon as we find out.

742
01:17:19.429 --> 01:17:21.973
- Perhaps it's a drug test?
- Yeah, it could be.

743
01:17:22.098 --> 01:17:24.892
I've never heard of a drug test at a sheepdog contest before.

744
01:17:26.318 --> 01:17:29.581
We've got somethin' here
that might be of use to our pig.

745
01:17:29.993 --> 01:17:33.662
Password! Password!

746
01:17:33.867 --> 01:17:36.328
Before we gives you anythin',

747
01:17:36.453 --> 01:17:39.220
- you'll be makin' us a solemn promise.
- Yes?

748
01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:42.886
- Treat us civil!
- Yes! You gotta treat us nice- like.

749
01:17:43.351 --> 01:17:45.134
I'll try.

750
01:17:45.298 --> 01:17:49.175
- No bitin'!
- That's right. Wolf must avoid bitin' us sheep...

751
01:17:49.275 --> 01:17:51.990
- at all costs!
- All right! I'll try that too.

752
01:17:53.137 --> 01:17:57.183
It's preposterous! We'd be the laughingstock
of every sheepdog organization...

753
01:17:57.308 --> 01:18:00.102
in every civilized country in the world!
- There's no rule...

754
01:18:00.186 --> 01:18:03.940
We'll see about that when the adjudication
committee have finished their meeting.

755
01:18:04.023 --> 01:18:09.445
What will we have next year,
a laughing hyena doing show jumping?

756
01:18:09.528 --> 01:18:12.865
But the most important of all,
you must promise...

757
01:18:12.990 --> 01:18:16.661
never ever to let this password
we be about to give...

758
01:18:16.744 --> 01:18:18.996
to be used against
any sheep anywhere.

759
01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:21.582
I promise you that.
I'll make sure the pig knows it too.

760
01:18:21.707 --> 01:18:25.252
- We have the promise!
- 'Tis for Babe.

761
01:18:25.378 --> 01:18:27.922
Maa would have wanted it.

762
01:18:31.133 --> 01:18:34.011
Baa, ram, ewe.

763
01:18:34.095 --> 01:18:36.847
Baa, ram, ewe.

764
01:18:36.973 --> 01:18:41.060
To your breed, your fleece,
your clan be true.

765
01:18:41.185 --> 01:18:46.148
Sheep be true.
Baa, ram, ewe.

766
01:18:46.232 --> 01:18:48.526
Is that it?
Is that the password?

767
01:19:05.043 --> 01:19:08.087
Mr. Hoggett, the judges
would like me to convey to you...

768
01:19:08.213 --> 01:19:11.674
their disappointment
that a man such as yourself,

769
01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:16.179
with a long and honorable association with
the work of National Sheepdog Association,

770
01:19:16.304 --> 01:19:19.182
should see fit to flout...

771
01:19:19.265 --> 01:19:23.478
the historic conventions
which have long ruled our sport.

772
01:19:23.561 --> 01:19:26.773
However we find there
is no rule, as such,

773
01:19:26.898 --> 01:19:31.736
which would prevent your...
animal... being entered.

774
01:19:45.959 --> 01:19:48.920
The committee has ruled
that if you wish to proceed,

775
01:19:49.045 --> 01:19:51.923
there is nothing we can do
to stop you.

776
01:19:54.048 --> 01:19:57.301
What do you wish
to do?

777
01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:06.020
There appears
to be some movement down there now.

778
01:20:06.104 --> 01:20:08.565
I expect if there are
no further problems,

779
01:20:08.690 --> 01:20:12.402
we shall see Hoggett
and his dog Pig.

780
01:20:12.527 --> 01:20:15.363
- Unusual name. Strange name, isn't it?
- Pig.

781
01:20:15.447 --> 01:20:17.574
Anyone for a game
of cards?

782
01:20:17.699 --> 01:20:20.410
Oh, good grief! Look!

783
01:20:37.469 --> 01:20:40.597
He's a fool!

784
01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:45.393
Entry number 23,
Mr. A. Hoggett with Pig.

785
01:21:12.170 --> 01:21:15.673
This is just too crazy to believe.

786
01:21:15.799 --> 01:21:18.635
And if that isn't enough.
We have a stray dog on the field.

787
01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:21.012
They trying to round him up?

788
01:21:21.137 --> 01:21:25.558
The dog's gonna give a few tips
on how to be a sheep pig.

789
01:21:38.696 --> 01:21:42.492
Well,
it's up to him now.

790
01:21:57.757 --> 01:22:00.426
Away to me, Pig.

791
01:22:07.642 --> 01:22:11.771
Get off!

792
01:22:15.775 --> 01:22:18.653
Baa, ram, ewe.
Baa, ram, ewe!

793
01:22:18.736 --> 01:22:22.866
To your breed, your fleece,
your clan be true.

794
01:22:22.991 --> 01:22:26.035
Sheep be true.
Baa, ram, ewe.

795
01:22:26.161 --> 01:22:29.914
What...
what did you say?

796
01:22:30.039 --> 01:22:33.751
Get yourself a dog, Hoggett.

797
01:22:40.799 --> 01:22:44.128
There, there, Esme.
It's not the end of the world.

798
01:22:44.137 --> 01:22:48.266
Is he just going to
stand there until his time runs out?

799
01:22:48.391 --> 01:22:50.310
Or could this be
some sort of protest?

800
01:22:50.393 --> 01:22:53.521
Maybe we should line up an
interview with the sheep pig?

801
01:22:53.646 --> 01:22:56.107
Or the sheep pig's trainer.

802
01:22:56.232 --> 01:22:58.526
He's a lively sort of fellow
by the looks of things.

803
01:22:58.610 --> 01:23:01.404
Good heavens!

804
01:23:25.843 --> 01:23:28.721
- Hey!
- Shh.

805
01:23:28.846 --> 01:23:31.557
It's Babe!

806
01:23:42.193 --> 01:23:43.903
I... I...

807
01:23:44.028 --> 01:23:46.739
- It, uh...
- Hmm.

808
01:23:50.578 --> 01:23:54.165
Oh, beautifully done! I can't
tell you how grateful I am to y'all.

809
01:23:54.290 --> 01:23:56.417
Now, for one last favor.

810
01:23:56.543 --> 01:23:59.754
If the three ladies with collars
would kindly walk out of the ring,

811
01:23:59.879 --> 01:24:01.923
I'd be very much obliged.

812
01:25:49.781 --> 01:25:52.534
And so it was that
in all the celebration,

813
01:25:52.659 --> 01:25:55.495
in all the hubbub
of noise and excitement,

814
01:25:55.578 --> 01:25:59.040
there were two figures
who stood silent and still...

815
01:25:59.165 --> 01:26:02.127
side by side.

816
01:26:03.878 --> 01:26:07.006
The pig did it! The perfect score!

817
01:26:09.259 --> 01:26:11.177
Yippee! Yippee!

818
01:26:12.261 --> 01:26:17.141
And though every single human
in the stands or in the commentary boxes...

819
01:26:17.224 --> 01:26:20.811
was at a complete loss
for words,

820
01:26:20.894 --> 01:26:24.690
the man, who in his life had uttered
fewer words than any of them...

821
01:26:24.815 --> 01:26:28.610
knew exactly what to say.

822
01:26:28.735 --> 01:26:30.904
That'll do, Pig.

823
01:26:34.229 --> 01:26:35.464
That'll do.

824
01:26:49.132 --> 01:26:52.886
And a-one and a-two
and a-three. Hit it.
