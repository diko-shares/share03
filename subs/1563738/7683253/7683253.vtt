WEBVTT

1
00:03:02.577 --> 00:03:03.869
Bye, guys.

2
00:03:03.911 --> 00:03:05.329
It's three years.

3
00:03:05.371 --> 00:03:06.581
Three years together.

4
00:03:06.622 --> 00:03:07.915
The lads.

5
00:03:07.956 --> 00:03:09.708
Me and you?

6
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.002
We'll see each
other again. Really?

7
00:03:12.044 --> 00:03:12.545
They're not going, are they?

8
00:03:13.921 --> 00:03:16.591
Group hug!

9
00:03:16.632 --> 00:03:18.842
See you, ladies! See you later.

10
00:03:21.345 --> 00:03:23.097
Group hug.

11
00:03:23.138 --> 00:03:24.723
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!

12
00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:27.351
Tilly?

13
00:03:27.393 --> 00:03:28.769
Callum!

14
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.438
Tilly, come on.
It's time to go home.

15
00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:32.147
Come on. Callum!

16
00:03:33.232 --> 00:03:34.483
Ow!

17
00:03:41.031 --> 00:03:43.117
You know,
we've never actually met.

18
00:03:43.158 --> 00:03:43.992
Actually, we have.
Several times.

19
00:03:44.034 --> 00:03:46.036
Have we?

20
00:03:46.078 --> 00:03:48.414
You gatecrashed my
birthday party, called me Julie,

21
00:03:48.456 --> 00:03:49.540
and spilled red wine
down my top.

22
00:03:49.582 --> 00:03:50.374
Ouch.

23
00:03:51.584 --> 00:03:52.793
Well, I'm sorry about that.

24
00:03:52.834 --> 00:03:54.002
No, not at all.

25
00:03:54.044 --> 00:03:54.920
You were delightful.

26
00:03:54.962 --> 00:03:56.130
Was I?

27
00:03:56.171 --> 00:03:58.006
No. No, you weren't.

28
00:03:58.048 --> 00:04:00.175
Look, if you're
not Julie, then...

29
00:04:00.217 --> 00:04:01.636
I'm Emma. Emma.

30
00:04:01.677 --> 00:04:03.178
Emma Morley. Emma Morley.

31
00:04:04.179 --> 00:04:05.681
Listen, I'll walk you home.

32
00:04:09.184 --> 00:04:10.478
So this is me.

33
00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:12.146
Shh! Welcome home.

34
00:04:12.187 --> 00:04:14.189
So debate is fine,
but anyone can talk...

35
00:04:19.194 --> 00:04:21.863
Just sometimes,
action's what's needed.

36
00:04:21.905 --> 00:04:24.408
To change the world.
I completely agree.

37
00:04:26.243 --> 00:04:29.204
So what are you gonna be
when you're, I don't know, 40?

38
00:04:29.246 --> 00:04:30.706
Forty?

39
00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:33.709
Can I say famous? Horribly rich?

40
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.836
Terrible.
You're so terribly posh.

41
00:04:37.004 --> 00:04:38.297
Where are you going?

42
00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:39.256
I'm just gonna
go brush my teeth.

43
00:04:39.298 --> 00:04:40.508
You know, booze and fags and...

44
00:04:40.549 --> 00:04:41.467
I don't mind.

45
00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:43.511
I do.

46
00:04:43.552 --> 00:04:45.095
Listen, won't be a minute.

47
00:04:47.014 --> 00:04:48.474
No playing with yourself
while I'm gone.

48
00:04:50.934 --> 00:04:51.893
What?

49
00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.242
All right, concentrate.

50
00:05:07.284 --> 00:05:10.245
Concentrate.
Do not cock this up!

51
00:05:24.885 --> 00:05:26.762
Oh, you're going?

52
00:05:26.803 --> 00:05:29.431
Well, it's getting light out,
so I thought I could just...

53
00:05:29.473 --> 00:05:31.517
You should go if you want to go.

54
00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:32.851
It's very poignant.
Very bittersweet.

55
00:05:32.893 --> 00:05:34.520
Really I just thought you
might wanna get some sleep.

56
00:05:34.562 --> 00:05:35.854
I don't have to go.

57
00:05:35.896 --> 00:05:36.855
No, no, go. I'm not bothered.

58
00:05:36.897 --> 00:05:38.440
Sneak off.

59
00:05:38.482 --> 00:05:40.025
I wasn't sneaking off.

60
00:05:40.067 --> 00:05:41.109
Jump out the window
for all I care.

61
00:05:41.151 --> 00:05:42.861
It's five floors up, mind.

62
00:05:42.903 --> 00:05:44.279
Look, I'll stay. All right?

63
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.241
I'll stay.

64
00:05:47.282 --> 00:05:48.492
Come on.

65
00:05:52.496 --> 00:05:54.331
Sorry, I'm no good at this.

66
00:05:56.124 --> 00:05:58.335
It's just whenever
I go to bed with someone,

67
00:05:58.377 --> 00:06:01.880
I always end up
either laughing or weeping,

68
00:06:01.922 --> 00:06:03.340
and it could be nice to go
for something in between.

69
00:06:03.382 --> 00:06:06.260
Look, that's fine.

70
00:06:06.301 --> 00:06:08.721
That's fine. Maybe we
could just be friends.

71
00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.516
Okay. Friends.

72
00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:27.489
Of course, you know it's Saint
Swithin's Day today, don't you?

73
00:06:27.531 --> 00:06:29.991
What is?

74
00:06:30.033 --> 00:06:33.495
Well, today. Saint Swithin's
Day, the 15th of July.

75
00:06:33.537 --> 00:06:35.539
How do you know that?

76
00:06:35.581 --> 00:06:38.333
Well, he was buried in
Winchester Cathedral,

77
00:06:38.375 --> 00:06:40.294
which is where I went to school.

78
00:06:40.335 --> 00:06:41.837
Well, la-dee-da.

79
00:06:41.878 --> 00:06:43.004
La-dee-da.

80
00:06:44.881 --> 00:06:47.926
You know, there's a poem.

81
00:06:47.968 --> 00:06:51.806
"If on Saint Swithin's Day,
it doth rain

82
00:06:51.847 --> 00:06:55.976
"something, something,
something remain."

83
00:06:56.017 --> 00:06:57.728
Dexter, that's beautiful.

84
00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:59.647
Shut up.

85
00:06:59.688 --> 00:07:01.774
Let's get some sleep.

86
00:07:09.239 --> 00:07:10.741
But, Dex.

87
00:07:10.783 --> 00:07:12.242
Em?

88
00:07:12.284 --> 00:07:13.952
If it doesn't rain...

89
00:07:13.994 --> 00:07:15.203
Mmm-hmm?

90
00:07:17.998 --> 00:07:20.083
do you want to do
something? Me and you?

91
00:07:21.418 --> 00:07:22.377
Mmm-hmm.

92
00:07:26.465 --> 00:07:27.382
- Are you all right?
- Lift, lift.

93
00:07:27.424 --> 00:07:29.050
Okay, well, I'm coming up.

94
00:07:32.387 --> 00:07:34.014
Couldn't you have just hired
someone to move this stuff?

95
00:07:34.055 --> 00:07:34.973
No.

96
00:07:36.266 --> 00:07:37.768
Look, I would have paid.

97
00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:40.187
All right, lift from your end.

98
00:07:40.228 --> 00:07:41.856
You've obviously never
done a day's work in your life.

99
00:07:41.897 --> 00:07:45.818
Look, seriously, Em,
my plane leaves in four hours.

100
00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:47.653
All right, well, all the more
reason why you should lift.

101
00:07:47.695 --> 00:07:48.904
God's sake.

102
00:07:50.614 --> 00:07:51.866
Look, I'm doing you a favor.

103
00:07:51.907 --> 00:07:53.575
And I am so, so grateful.

104
00:07:53.617 --> 00:07:54.993
Stop whinging.

105
00:07:57.621 --> 00:07:59.623
I bet this bed
could tell some stories.

106
00:07:59.665 --> 00:08:02.710
Yeah, short stories.
Horror stories.

107
00:08:02.751 --> 00:08:05.379
Welcome to London.
Well, lift it.

108
00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:11.927
I think I'm gonna
be very happy here.

109
00:08:11.968 --> 00:08:13.303
What is that smell?

110
00:08:13.345 --> 00:08:14.930
Onions.

111
00:08:14.971 --> 00:08:16.097
Onions and disappointment.

112
00:08:16.765 --> 00:08:18.183
Right.

113
00:08:18.225 --> 00:08:19.810
No, it's not that bad.

114
00:08:19.852 --> 00:08:22.187
It's nothing
that a lick of paint

115
00:08:22.229 --> 00:08:24.606
and a nuclear warhead can't fix.

116
00:08:24.648 --> 00:08:27.943
I've got my typewriter. I've
got my books. I'm in London.

117
00:08:27.984 --> 00:08:29.444
I think it's
going to be all right.

118
00:08:29.486 --> 00:08:30.696
I might actually
get things done.

119
00:08:30.738 --> 00:08:32.406
You know, you might
actually meet someone.

120
00:08:32.447 --> 00:08:33.407
Dexter, please.

121
00:08:33.448 --> 00:08:34.658
A nice guy.

122
00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.660
Sensitive, wears a cardigan.

123
00:08:36.702 --> 00:08:38.119
I told you I'm not interested
in any of that.

124
00:08:38.161 --> 00:08:40.205
Matching glasses,
matching opinions.

125
00:08:40.247 --> 00:08:41.874
I'm actually glad
you're going to India.

126
00:08:41.916 --> 00:08:44.835
Good, 'cause I'm leaving.
I've got to catch my flight.

127
00:08:44.877 --> 00:08:46.628
Already?

128
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:47.922
Yeah, I'm sorry.

129
00:08:50.591 --> 00:08:53.343
Well, go on then. Find yourself.

130
00:08:53.385 --> 00:08:55.637
Keep sending me those letters.

131
00:08:55.679 --> 00:08:57.848
Long ones. I will.

132
00:08:57.890 --> 00:08:59.057
And have fun, Em.

133
00:08:59.099 --> 00:09:00.517
Of course.

134
00:09:00.559 --> 00:09:03.144
You know, it is allowed.

135
00:09:03.186 --> 00:09:04.897
You know, I've got a feeling
that this time next year

136
00:09:04.939 --> 00:09:05.981
you're going to
take London by storm.

137
00:09:14.406 --> 00:09:15.741
What is
the difference between...

138
00:09:15.783 --> 00:09:17.242
A tortilla is
either corn or wheat.

139
00:09:17.284 --> 00:09:19.327
But a corn tortilla
folded and filled is a taco,

140
00:09:19.369 --> 00:09:21.288
whereas a filled
wheat tortilla is a burrito.

141
00:09:21.329 --> 00:09:23.331
Deep fry a burrito,
it's a chimichanga.

142
00:09:23.373 --> 00:09:26.084
Toast a tortilla, it's a tostada.
Roll it, it's an enchilada.

143
00:09:28.796 --> 00:09:30.130
Is there any chance
you could repeat that?

144
00:09:33.174 --> 00:09:35.469
Hello. I'm Ian. Ian Whitehead.

145
00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:37.721
The new boy.

146
00:09:37.763 --> 00:09:38.973
Welcome to
the graveyard of ambition.

147
00:09:41.516 --> 00:09:43.518
The kitchen. All right, mate.

148
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.312
What these guys
can't do with a microwave

149
00:09:45.353 --> 00:09:46.480
and a deep-fat fryer.

150
00:09:46.521 --> 00:09:48.523
Hey, you!

151
00:09:48.565 --> 00:09:50.776
Your basic Tex-Mex food groups.

152
00:09:50.818 --> 00:09:52.611
Cheese on top of
chicken under guacamole

153
00:09:52.653 --> 00:09:55.363
on top of beans
under rice on top of beef.

154
00:09:55.405 --> 00:09:58.826
Word of warning,
avoid the jumbo prawns.

155
00:09:58.867 --> 00:10:01.411
It's like Russian Roulette.
One in six will kill you.

156
00:10:01.453 --> 00:10:02.203
So what's your stroke?

157
00:10:02.871 --> 00:10:04.623
Sorry, my what?

158
00:10:04.665 --> 00:10:07.793
Waiter/actor,
waiter/model, waiter/writer?

159
00:10:07.835 --> 00:10:10.504
Well, I'm a comedian.

160
00:10:10.545 --> 00:10:13.841
We could use a comedian. We
all like to laugh. I know I used to.

161
00:10:13.882 --> 00:10:15.509
Well, I'm just
starting out really.

162
00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:18.178
Working on my
"unique comedy stylings."

163
00:10:18.219 --> 00:10:21.222
Not jokes so much, more
sort of wry, little observations.

164
00:10:21.974 --> 00:10:23.934
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">Ay caramba!</i>

165
00:10:23.976 --> 00:10:25.435
I've got this whole bit
at the moment

166
00:10:25.477 --> 00:10:27.980
about the difference
between men and women.

167
00:10:28.022 --> 00:10:30.774
How blokes, when they see
a girl they fancy, they get all...

168
00:10:30.816 --> 00:10:33.151
Toilets. Staff toilets. Oh.

169
00:10:33.193 --> 00:10:35.029
Sorry. You were saying?

170
00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:37.948
No, no. I'm doing an open mic
tonight if you were interested.

171
00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:41.576
At The House of Laffs,
spelled L-A-F-F-S.

172
00:10:41.618 --> 00:10:43.161
It's not a date or anything.

173
00:10:43.203 --> 00:10:44.412
You've probably got a
boyfriend anyway, have you?

174
00:10:46.707 --> 00:10:49.835
Ian, I'd love to come,
but after work,

175
00:10:49.877 --> 00:10:51.920
I like to head home,
comfort eat, weep.

176
00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:56.884
So what about you, Emma?
What's your stroke?

177
00:10:56.925 --> 00:10:58.969
What do you really do?

178
00:10:59.011 --> 00:11:01.596
Uh, this. This is what I do.

179
00:11:02.806 --> 00:11:04.808
Still, it's not forever, is it?

180
00:11:10.064 --> 00:11:13.859
My room still smells. Tilly's
sending me mad. The flat's a dump.

181
00:11:13.901 --> 00:11:16.028
I keep finding
teeth marks in the cheese

182
00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:18.238
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">and her big gray bras
<font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">soaking in the sink.</i>

183
00:11:18.279 --> 00:11:19.280
Look, I'm sure it's
not a complete disaster.

184
00:11:20.615 --> 00:11:22.826
London's swallowed me up.

185
00:11:25.871 --> 00:11:28.040
I thought I'd make a difference,
but no one knows I'm here.

186
00:11:28.082 --> 00:11:30.125
Listen, listen. Nothing
truly good was ever easy.

187
00:11:30.166 --> 00:11:30.876
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">Who said that?</i>

188
00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:32.920
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">You did.</i>

189
00:11:32.961 --> 00:11:36.006
Did I? That's annoying.

190
00:11:36.048 --> 00:11:39.384
I'm sorry for moaning. I
just... I really wanted to hear...

191
00:11:39.426 --> 00:11:40.719
How's teaching? How's Paris?

192
00:11:41.553 --> 00:11:43.221
It's good, Em.

193
00:11:43.263 --> 00:11:45.807
You know,
truly, really fulfilling.

194
00:11:45.849 --> 00:11:47.935
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">Well, don't sleep with
<font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">any of your students.</i>

195
00:11:47.976 --> 00:11:50.020
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">It's unethical <font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">and predictable.</i>

196
00:11:50.062 --> 00:11:51.271
It's good advice, Em. Thank you.

197
00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.108
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">But I've got to go
<font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">and have lunch with Mum.</i>

198

<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">Well, <font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">apologize again, will you?</i>

199
00:11:57.569 --> 00:11:59.738
I didn't mean to
call your dad a fascist.

200
00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:01.656
A bourgeois fascist.

201
00:12:01.698 --> 00:12:04.409
Say sorry and, Dexter...

202
00:12:04.451 --> 00:12:05.827
My money's running out. Em?

203
00:12:05.869 --> 00:12:07.829
Can you hear me? Dex? Dex?

204
00:12:14.795 --> 00:12:16.171
I miss you.

205
00:12:40.946 --> 00:12:42.114
Forty-five minutes late.

206
00:12:42.156 --> 00:12:43.573
Yeah, well, I got waylaid.

207
00:12:43.615 --> 00:12:45.117
And where were you last night?

208
00:12:45.159 --> 00:12:46.868
Language school disco.

209
00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:48.703
Was it fun? No, it was hell.

210
00:12:50.413 --> 00:12:53.083
Tell me, who's been writing
you all those long letters?

211
00:12:53.125 --> 00:12:55.210
That is none of your business.

212
00:12:55.251 --> 00:12:58.172
Was it that girl
who came to stay?

213
00:12:58.213 --> 00:12:58.922
Yeah. Well, Emma and I
are just good friends.

214
00:13:02.801 --> 00:13:05.720
How much holiday do you need?

215
00:13:05.762 --> 00:13:08.140
I'm not on holiday.
I'm teaching English.

216
00:13:08.182 --> 00:13:08.932
Dexter.

217
00:13:12.019 --> 00:13:14.021
Isn't that Alain Delon?

218
00:13:14.062 --> 00:13:16.106
What? Oh, no. It's your father.

219
00:13:18.859 --> 00:13:21.028
Picking his corns. Stop it.

220
00:13:23.864 --> 00:13:26.200
Take me for lunch tomorrow,
will you?

221
00:13:26.241 --> 00:13:29.369
Just you and me. Somewhere
quiet with white tablecloths.

222
00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:31.579
I want to talk to you.

223
00:13:31.621 --> 00:13:32.622
Why? Is something wrong?

224
00:13:32.664 --> 00:13:35.209
No. Nothing's wrong.

225
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:36.417
Then why do we need to talk?

226
00:13:36.459 --> 00:13:37.794
Do I need a reason?

227
00:13:38.837 --> 00:13:40.672
There you are. Degenerate.

228
00:13:46.469 --> 00:13:48.972
Now, I thought
you might want these.

229
00:13:50.265 --> 00:13:54.019
Oh, thank you, my love.

230
00:13:54.061 --> 00:13:57.772
So what's for supper?
Please, God, not French food.

231
00:14:13.247 --> 00:14:15.415
Golden Boy wants
to see you. Hmm?

232
00:14:15.456 --> 00:14:17.125
He's got a new one.

233
00:14:23.506 --> 00:14:25.383
Good night. Good night.

234
00:14:25.425 --> 00:14:26.134
Night. Good night.

235
00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:28.595
Have a good one.

236
00:14:28.636 --> 00:14:30.305
We were just kissing.

237
00:14:30.346 --> 00:14:33.850
You were trying to fit her
entire head in your mouth.

238
00:14:33.892 --> 00:14:36.770
People have enough trouble
keeping the food down as it is.

239
00:14:36.811 --> 00:14:38.563
And what does she
see in you, anyway?

240
00:14:38.605 --> 00:14:40.481
Well, she says I'm complicated.

241
00:14:42.109 --> 00:14:43.110
You're just spoiled.

242
00:14:47.239 --> 00:14:50.242
I got offered
the job of manager today.

243
00:14:50.284 --> 00:14:53.203
They told me they wanted
someone who wasn't going anywhere.

244
00:14:53.245 --> 00:14:55.663
All right, Em, listen. I think you
should take a bottle of tequila,

245
00:14:55.705 --> 00:14:57.332
I think you should
walk out the door,

246
00:14:57.373 --> 00:14:58.583
and I don't think you
need to ever come back.

247
00:14:58.625 --> 00:15:00.710
But my job is my life.

248
00:15:00.752 --> 00:15:03.504
You can't throw away years
of your life just because,

249
00:15:03.546 --> 00:15:05.799
well, you think it's funny.

250
00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.343
My hair smells of cheese.
Monterey Jack.

251
00:15:09.844 --> 00:15:12.264
Look, I thought you
were writing poetry.

252
00:15:12.306 --> 00:15:15.433
What, go where the money is?
Tried that. Failed.

253
00:15:15.475 --> 00:15:17.602
You just can't see it, can you?

254
00:15:17.644 --> 00:15:20.105
Look, you're funny. You're
attractive. You're smart.

255
00:15:20.147 --> 00:15:21.940
I mean, you're
the smartest person I know.

256
00:15:21.982 --> 00:15:24.318
Sure.
You are. You're attractive.

257
00:15:24.359 --> 00:15:26.444
You're sexy. What?

258
00:15:26.486 --> 00:15:28.446
What? Is that supposed to be
sexist or something?

259
00:15:28.488 --> 00:15:31.825
No, it's not sexist.
It's just ridiculous.

260
00:15:31.866 --> 00:15:32.784
Em, listen.

261
00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:38.290
If I could just give
you one gift, all right,

262
00:15:38.332 --> 00:15:40.334
one gift for
the rest of your life,

263
00:15:40.375 --> 00:15:42.961
do you know what I'd give you?

264
00:15:43.003 --> 00:15:43.795
Confidence.

265
00:15:45.505 --> 00:15:47.215
It's either that
or a scented candle.

266
00:15:48.549 --> 00:15:49.467
Come here.

267
00:15:52.512 --> 00:15:56.266
Emma? So I've disinfected
the meat fridge.

268
00:15:56.308 --> 00:15:58.393
My hero.

269
00:15:58.434 --> 00:16:00.728
Thank you, Ian.
See you tomorrow.

270
00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:01.980
Bye, mate.

271
00:16:03.982 --> 00:16:06.651
Bye, Emma.

272
00:16:06.693 --> 00:16:08.903
I should go, too. All right.

273
00:16:08.945 --> 00:16:12.115
I'll be fine. I just
feel a bit lost, that's all.

274
00:16:12.157 --> 00:16:14.284
Come on, everyone's lost at 25.

275
00:16:14.326 --> 00:16:16.286
You're not.

276
00:16:16.328 --> 00:16:20.290
Trainee TV producer.
Nice new flat. CD player.

277
00:16:20.332 --> 00:16:22.292
Group sex Tuesdays and Fridays.

278
00:16:22.334 --> 00:16:24.836
Yeah, but you know,
I am crying on the inside.

279
00:16:31.467 --> 00:16:32.552
You know what you need,
don't you?

280
00:16:32.593 --> 00:16:34.179
Mmm-mmm.

281
00:16:34.221 --> 00:16:35.930
You need a holiday.

282
00:16:37.932 --> 00:16:40.143
Look, Dexter, all I'm saying
is I think we need some rules.

283
00:16:40.185 --> 00:16:42.437
Rules!

284
00:16:42.478 --> 00:16:44.564
I'm not taking any chances
with our friendship, all right.

285
00:16:44.605 --> 00:16:46.233
All right, all right. Such as?

286
00:16:46.274 --> 00:16:47.901
Separate bedrooms.

287
00:16:47.942 --> 00:16:50.528
Wherever we stay, no shared
beds, no drunken cuddles.

288
00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:52.364
I don't see the point
of cuddling, anyway.

289
00:16:52.406 --> 00:16:53.407
Cuddling gives you cramp.

290
00:16:53.448 --> 00:16:54.241
Agreed, then.

291
00:16:55.992 --> 00:16:58.786
Rule number two. No flirting.

292
00:16:58.828 --> 00:17:00.705
No having a few drinks
and getting frisky with me.

293
00:17:00.747 --> 00:17:01.915
Or anyone else.

294
00:17:01.956 --> 00:17:02.916
Well, I never flirt.

295
00:17:02.957 --> 00:17:04.584
I'm serious.

296
00:17:04.625 --> 00:17:06.378
Hello, what's this?

297
00:17:16.763 --> 00:17:18.723
Which leads me to rule three.

298
00:17:18.765 --> 00:17:21.226
The nudity clause. What?

299
00:17:21.268 --> 00:17:23.144
I don't want to see you in
the shower, or have a wee.

300
00:17:23.186 --> 00:17:24.645
Or have a wee in the shower.

301
00:17:24.687 --> 00:17:26.189
Well, I can't promise that.

302
00:17:26.231 --> 00:17:27.857
You have to, Dex.
It's the rules,

303
00:17:27.899 --> 00:17:30.860
and absolutely
no skinny-dipping.

304
00:17:33.488 --> 00:17:35.573
All right, then. Rule
number four. What?

305
00:17:35.615 --> 00:17:37.367
No Scrabble. I love Scrabble.

306
00:17:37.409 --> 00:17:40.161
That is exactly
why it's my rule.

307
00:17:40.203 --> 00:17:41.037
Look, we're not dead yet.

308
00:17:46.209 --> 00:17:47.252
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">Voilà.</i>

309
00:17:59.931 --> 00:18:01.766
What is that?

310
00:18:01.808 --> 00:18:04.769
Hmm? My swimming costume.
It's called the Edwardian.

311
00:18:04.811 --> 00:18:07.397
No, the masonry paint.

312
00:18:07.439 --> 00:18:09.649
It's factor 30. I burn.

313
00:18:16.948 --> 00:18:18.699
Here, let me.

314
00:18:28.084 --> 00:18:29.919
I've not seen this before.

315
00:18:29.961 --> 00:18:32.255
What, that?
I got that in Thailand.

316
00:18:32.297 --> 00:18:34.215
It's a yin-yang.

317
00:18:34.257 --> 00:18:36.050
Looks like a road sign.

318
00:18:37.885 --> 00:18:40.221
Yeah, well, it means "the
perfect union of opposites."

319
00:18:40.263 --> 00:18:42.140
It means "wear some socks."

320
00:18:47.854 --> 00:18:51.107
This is scooped
a bit low, isn't it?

321
00:18:51.149 --> 00:18:53.276
Good job I didn't
put it on backwards.

322
00:19:05.788 --> 00:19:07.665
I think I'll go for a dip.

323
00:19:31.898 --> 00:19:33.858
This is a nudist beach.

324
00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:35.193
No, it's not.

325
00:19:35.235 --> 00:19:38.112
It is. Look. They're barbecuing!

326
00:19:40.031 --> 00:19:42.742
You see, I couldn't do that.
Barbecue naked.

327
00:19:42.783 --> 00:19:45.495
What is that? Is that yoga?

328
00:19:45.537 --> 00:19:47.330
Oh, God.

329
00:19:47.372 --> 00:19:50.124
Grow up, all right.
Back to your magazine.

330
00:19:56.631 --> 00:19:58.758
I can hear you thinking.
It's like this crunching noise.

331
00:19:58.799 --> 00:20:01.302
The answer is no.

332
00:20:01.344 --> 00:20:03.721
Don't you think we'd feel more
comfortable with our clothes off?

333
00:20:03.763 --> 00:20:05.181
Unbelievable. Just unbelievable.

334
00:20:05.223 --> 00:20:06.766
Well, why not?

335
00:20:06.807 --> 00:20:10.103
The rules. Not to
mention your girlfriend.

336
00:20:10.144 --> 00:20:11.354
What, Ingrid? Yeah, Ingrid.

337
00:20:11.396 --> 00:20:13.773
She's very uninhibited.

338
00:20:13.814 --> 00:20:15.816
She'd have had her top off
at the check-in desk.

339
00:20:15.858 --> 00:20:17.652
Well, as you keep pointing
out, Ingrid used to be a model.

340
00:20:17.693 --> 00:20:20.154
You could be a model.

341
00:20:20.196 --> 00:20:23.324
For a catalog or something.

342
00:20:23.366 --> 00:20:25.577
I'm just saying that we're not
entirely unknown to each other

343
00:20:25.619 --> 00:20:26.786
from a physical point of view.

344
00:20:26.827 --> 00:20:28.538
Drop it, Dex.

345
00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:30.957
Well, you know,
that night after graduation.

346
00:20:30.998 --> 00:20:32.667
Come on, you must remember.

347
00:20:32.708 --> 00:20:34.210
No. Blanked it out
like a car crash.

348
00:20:34.252 --> 00:20:36.796
Well, I haven't.

349
00:20:36.837 --> 00:20:39.633
In fact, if I close my eyes,

350
00:20:39.674 --> 00:20:41.551
I can still see you there just
standing in the dawn light.

351
00:20:41.593 --> 00:20:43.177
Please don't.

352
00:20:43.219 --> 00:20:45.680
Provocatively
unclasping your dungarees

353
00:20:45.721 --> 00:20:47.056
as you walk over to me.

354
00:20:47.098 --> 00:20:48.933
I was not wearing dungarees.

355
00:20:48.975 --> 00:20:51.185
So you do remember, huh?

356
00:20:57.108 --> 00:20:58.610
Have I caught the sun?

357
00:20:59.486 --> 00:21:02.405
No, you look...

358
00:21:02.447 --> 00:21:03.781
You look fine.

359
00:21:17.253 --> 00:21:18.713
Do you know I've
never been abroad?

360
00:21:18.754 --> 00:21:19.880
What? Don't be ridiculous.

361
00:21:19.922 --> 00:21:22.091
It's true.

362
00:21:22.133 --> 00:21:24.636
Fortnight in a caravan in Whitby
drinking Cup-a-Soup with Dad

363
00:21:24.678 --> 00:21:26.638
and trying not to kill Mum.

364
00:21:33.936 --> 00:21:36.356
I can't believe I'm
actually here with you.

365
00:21:38.065 --> 00:21:39.817
Why? Hmm?

366
00:21:39.859 --> 00:21:41.027
Why?

367
00:21:48.451 --> 00:21:51.829
When we were at university,
before we spoke even,

368
00:21:57.585 --> 00:21:58.252
I had a crush on you.

369
00:21:59.295 --> 00:22:02.340
Ridiculous, I know.

370
00:22:02.382 --> 00:22:07.220
But when we almost

371
00:22:07.261 --> 00:22:08.763
did it that night,

372
00:22:11.265 --> 00:22:12.726
I couldn't believe it.

373
00:22:14.185 --> 00:22:16.062
I wrote poems and everything.

374
00:22:19.399 --> 00:22:20.941
What have you
got to say to that?

375
00:22:20.983 --> 00:22:22.860
Well, I already knew.

376
00:22:26.155 --> 00:22:28.366
What do you mean, you knew?

377
00:22:28.408 --> 00:22:30.744
Well, I sort of guessed.

378
00:22:30.785 --> 00:22:34.706
All those epic letters
and compilation tapes.

379
00:22:36.082 --> 00:22:37.667
So, go on then. What happened?

380
00:22:37.709 --> 00:22:39.252
Mmm.

381
00:22:39.293 --> 00:22:41.504
I got to know you.
You cured me of you.

382
00:22:45.216 --> 00:22:48.302
I'd still like to read those
poems. What rhymes with Dexter?

383
00:22:48.344 --> 00:22:50.513
Prick. It's a half-rhyme.

384
00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:56.811
Too much wine. We should go.

385
00:22:56.852 --> 00:22:59.897
No, no, no. Not yet. Not yet.

386
00:22:59.939 --> 00:23:01.566
Listen, let's go for a walk.

387
00:23:05.528 --> 00:23:08.114
So this is it.

388
00:23:08.155 --> 00:23:09.449
It's lovely.

389
00:23:13.202 --> 00:23:15.413
Hello? What's going on here?

390
00:23:15.455 --> 00:23:17.206
Well, I thought we'd go for
a quick swim. Sober us up.

391
00:23:17.248 --> 00:23:20.293
Ah, I get it. I get it.

392
00:23:20.334 --> 00:23:22.754
I've walked right
into it, haven't I?

393
00:23:22.796 --> 00:23:26.924
You get a girl drunk and lead
her to a large body of water.

394
00:23:26.966 --> 00:23:29.302
Oh, come on, Em. Be spontaneous.

395
00:23:29.343 --> 00:23:31.512
Be reckless.
Live for the moment!

396
00:23:38.853 --> 00:23:40.563
Come on, Em. Get in!

397
00:23:40.605 --> 00:23:42.398
No!

398
00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:45.943
You're such a prude.
Why are you such a prude?

399
00:23:45.985 --> 00:23:47.361
Look, come on!

400
00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:52.992
You could at least
leave your underpants on.

401
00:23:53.033 --> 00:23:54.368
Rule number three, remember?

402
00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:55.620
Come on.

403
00:24:20.019 --> 00:24:22.480
So this is skinny-dipping?

404
00:24:22.522 --> 00:24:26.066
What am I meant to do? Sort of
lark about? Splash you or something?

405
00:24:36.202 --> 00:24:39.664
That's a very serious face.

406
00:24:39.706 --> 00:24:40.665
You're not
having a wee, are you?

407
00:24:40.707 --> 00:24:41.666
No.

408
00:24:47.421 --> 00:24:50.007
No, I just wanted to say that

409
00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:52.301
I felt the same.

410
00:24:54.846 --> 00:24:58.850
After our near-miss.

411
00:24:58.892 --> 00:25:01.644
I mean, I didn't write poems
or anything. I'm not insane.

412
00:25:04.063 --> 00:25:05.565
But, you know,
I thought about you.

413
00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:07.942
I think about you.

414
00:25:10.069 --> 00:25:11.404
You and me.

415
00:25:11.445 --> 00:25:12.780
Really?

416
00:25:14.866 --> 00:25:17.785
Really? Okay, well...

417
00:25:19.871 --> 00:25:21.163
Dex...

418
00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:24.959
The problem is I fancy
pretty much everyone.

419
00:25:27.921 --> 00:25:31.131
Oh. I see. I mean anyone.

420
00:25:31.173 --> 00:25:33.300
Really, I mean, it's like I've
just got out of prison, all the time.

421
00:25:33.342 --> 00:25:35.678
It's a real problem.
I can imagine.

422
00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:37.638
Yeah, and this thing
with Ingrid, it's a sex thing.

423
00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.891
It's just sex,
sex, sex, sex, sex.

424
00:25:39.933 --> 00:25:42.435
The point's been made, Dex.

425
00:25:42.476 --> 00:25:45.479
But me and you,
it would be different.

426
00:25:51.569 --> 00:25:55.072
I think we'd want
different things,

427
00:25:55.114 --> 00:25:57.658
and I don't think
I'm ready, you know.

428
00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:00.494
If you wanted to,
you know, have a bit of fun,

429
00:26:01.955 --> 00:26:04.081
holiday fling, no obligations.

430
00:26:13.967 --> 00:26:17.094
Oh, God. I'll take that
as a no then, shall I?

431
00:26:17.136 --> 00:26:18.095
I think so. I think
our moment's passed.

432
00:26:18.137 --> 00:26:21.098
Come on, I'm not
expressing myself clearly.

433
00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:22.767
No, no, you are, Dex.
That's the problem.

434
00:26:22.809 --> 00:26:24.560
You're worried I might care.

435
00:26:24.602 --> 00:26:27.396
Hey! Hey, Come back here!

436
00:26:27.438 --> 00:26:29.899
Come back, you little... Hey!

437
00:26:29.941 --> 00:26:32.986
Thieves!
Come back. Come back here.

438
00:26:33.027 --> 00:26:34.988
Wait!

439
00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:37.197
They've stolen my clothes!
You little...

440
00:26:42.369 --> 00:26:44.622
Will someone call the police?
Wait! Come back!

441
00:26:46.833 --> 00:26:49.585
Could you please stop laughing
and do something to help?

442
00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:55.800
Armani, that suit was.

443
00:26:55.842 --> 00:26:57.593
The little frogs
even took my underpants.

444
00:26:57.635 --> 00:26:58.803
Armani?

445
00:26:58.845 --> 00:27:00.054
No, Calvin Klein.

446
00:27:00.095 --> 00:27:01.722
Oh, Dex, I'm so sorry.

447
00:27:01.764 --> 00:27:03.432
Little French bastards!

448
00:27:03.474 --> 00:27:05.768
They took your plimsolls, too.

449
00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:08.562
They're not plimsolls. I've
never worn plimsolls in my life.

450
00:27:08.604 --> 00:27:09.981
They were penny loafers,
and I bloody loved them!

451
00:27:11.983 --> 00:27:14.401
What? It's not funny.
I'm a victim of crime here.

452
00:27:17.446 --> 00:27:18.739
Dex?

453
00:27:18.781 --> 00:27:19.782
What?

454
00:27:21.993 --> 00:27:24.745
Your Calvin Klein underpants.

455
00:27:24.787 --> 00:27:26.831
I'll find them.

456
00:27:26.873 --> 00:27:29.166
I swear to you,
I shall track them down.

457
00:27:29.208 --> 00:27:31.168
Go to sleep.

458
00:27:37.424 --> 00:27:39.552
I wonder how many
rules we broke.

459
00:27:39.593 --> 00:27:41.095
All of them.

460
00:27:42.429 --> 00:27:43.973
Except Scrabble.

461
00:27:44.015 --> 00:27:45.182
Tomorrow, maybe.

462
00:28:11.333 --> 00:28:13.794
Who says quality TV is dead?

463
00:28:13.836 --> 00:28:15.004
Plenty more of this when
we come back after the break,

464
00:28:15.046 --> 00:28:16.255
so do not go away.

465
00:28:16.296 --> 00:28:18.716
I'm warning you.
We know where you live.

466
00:28:18.758 --> 00:28:19.967
Go on, get out of here.

467
00:28:38.069 --> 00:28:41.030
Look, I just called,
all right, to let you know

468
00:28:41.072 --> 00:28:43.866
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">that you are the best friend
<font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">I've ever had.</i>

469
00:28:43.908 --> 00:28:46.452
I'm touched, Dex, but
you're off your face. <i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">And?</i>

470
00:28:46.493 --> 00:28:48.412
Look, it's 5:00 in
the morning. Go home.

471
00:28:48.454 --> 00:28:51.165
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">And you have <font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">an incredible body.</i>

472
00:28:51.248 --> 00:28:52.750
Dex!

473
00:28:52.792 --> 00:28:54.835
Is that Dexter?

474
00:28:54.877 --> 00:28:56.336
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white"> Just promise me
<font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">you'll go home, please?</i>

475
00:28:56.378 --> 00:28:58.131
I will, I will, I will,
I will, I will, I will.

476
00:28:58.172 --> 00:28:59.506
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">Dex, you have work
<font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">in the morning. Dex...</i>

477
00:28:59.548 --> 00:29:01.300
Look, good night, all right?

478
00:29:01.341 --> 00:29:05.262
Remember, you are absolutely,
truly amazing.

479
00:29:07.181 --> 00:29:09.934
Dexter? Dex?

480
00:29:12.895 --> 00:29:14.105
You're amazing

481
00:29:15.564 --> 00:29:17.483
and famous.

482
00:29:17.524 --> 00:29:18.818
I'm not that famous.

483
00:30:32.391 --> 00:30:35.186
Aye, aye. How are you, old man?

484
00:30:37.688 --> 00:30:41.441
Your mother's upstairs. She's
been waiting all morning for you.

485
00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:47.364
Good God, why are
you sweating like that?

486
00:30:48.991 --> 00:30:50.868
Well, it's a hot day.

487
00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:53.162
No, it's not.

488
00:30:53.204 --> 00:30:55.455
Look, how is she?

489
00:30:55.497 --> 00:30:57.583
Well, why don't you go and see?

490
00:31:03.505 --> 00:31:04.590
Mum?

491
00:31:22.733 --> 00:31:24.235
Hello, hello.

492
00:31:25.444 --> 00:31:26.737
Hello, stranger.

493
00:31:30.241 --> 00:31:33.410
Look, I've got
a present for you here.

494
00:31:33.452 --> 00:31:35.412
It's not from me.
It's from Emma.

495
00:31:36.247 --> 00:31:37.456
Here, let me.

496
00:31:37.497 --> 00:31:38.457
Thank you.

497
00:31:47.925 --> 00:31:50.803
Oh, how lovely.

498
00:31:50.844 --> 00:31:54.014
A little ambitious maybe.

499
00:31:54.056 --> 00:31:56.809
You might want to push her
towards short stories in the future.

500
00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:58.477
Mum, don't.

501
00:32:05.525 --> 00:32:08.654
So what have you been up to?

502
00:32:19.873 --> 00:32:22.042
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">I'm Dexter Mayhew. <font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">What a
show we've <font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">got for you tonight.</i>

503
00:32:22.084 --> 00:32:24.044
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">We've got a man who claims...</i>

504
00:32:24.086 --> 00:32:25.545
I'll skip this next bit.

505
00:32:27.506 --> 00:32:30.092
There's an interview
that's pretty good.

506
00:32:34.221 --> 00:32:36.098
Perhaps I'll watch it later.

507
00:32:39.352 --> 00:32:42.396
The live show is
always a bit patchy.

508
00:32:44.106 --> 00:32:46.650
I don't understand why
you have to use that voice,

509
00:32:46.692 --> 00:32:49.569
but then I suppose I just
don't care for this sort of thing.

510
00:32:49.611 --> 00:32:51.738
It's just a bit of fun for kids.

511
00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:53.866
They just watch it
after the pub.

512
00:32:53.907 --> 00:32:55.492
You mean I'm not drunk enough?

513
00:32:55.534 --> 00:32:57.328
No, it's not that.

514
00:32:57.370 --> 00:32:59.872
You know, honestly, Dexter.
Dancing girls in cages.

515
00:32:59.913 --> 00:33:01.874
Is this what it's come to?

516
00:33:01.915 --> 00:33:03.500
I just host it.

517
00:33:03.542 --> 00:33:05.002
It's a means to an end,
that's all.

518
00:33:05.044 --> 00:33:06.795
But to what end?

519
00:33:06.837 --> 00:33:09.089
We always said you could
do anything you wanted.

520
00:33:09.131 --> 00:33:11.550
Fine. What do you want me to do?

521
00:33:11.591 --> 00:33:13.886
Something good. It is good.

522
00:33:13.927 --> 00:33:17.264
I just do what I'm told.
Look, this is what I can do.

523
00:33:25.814 --> 00:33:27.941
I'm sorry.

524
00:33:27.983 --> 00:33:30.986
The medication makes me ratty.

525
00:33:31.028 --> 00:33:35.032
I just need a little lie-down.
I'll be better tonight.

526
00:33:35.074 --> 00:33:37.993
Yeah, you know, um...

527
00:33:38.035 --> 00:33:42.164
Actually, I've got
this premiere thingy tonight.

528
00:33:42.206 --> 00:33:45.376
Look, I'm sorry. I can't
miss it. It's <i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white"> Jurassic Park.</i>

529
00:33:53.467 --> 00:33:55.802
I'm afraid I'm going
to need some help.

530
00:34:00.849 --> 00:34:03.436
Are you all right?
Here, put your arm around me.

531
00:34:03.477 --> 00:34:04.770
All right. All right?

532
00:34:10.443 --> 00:34:11.360
Are you all right? Yes.

533
00:34:42.141 --> 00:34:45.811
Can I get you anything?
Water? Dry martini?

534
00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:17.801
What time is it?

535
00:35:17.843 --> 00:35:19.052
Quarter past 6:00.

536
00:35:20.846 --> 00:35:22.806
Yeah, I must have dozed off.

537
00:35:22.848 --> 00:35:24.933
I'm afraid
you've missed our day.

538
00:35:24.975 --> 00:35:27.644
Your father's
a little angry with you.

539
00:35:27.686 --> 00:35:30.105
Look, I'll stay tonight.

540
00:35:30.147 --> 00:35:33.692
No. You go.

541
00:35:33.733 --> 00:35:37.070
No pleasure for me watching you
and your father snarling at each other.

542
00:35:39.490 --> 00:35:41.492
Can I speak frankly?

543
00:35:41.534 --> 00:35:43.076
Do you have to?

544
00:35:43.118 --> 00:35:44.328
I think it's my prerogative.

545
00:35:47.289 --> 00:35:53.045
I know that you're going to be a fine
man. Decent, loving, accomplished.

546
00:35:53.086 --> 00:35:55.255
But I don't think
you're there yet.

547
00:35:55.297 --> 00:35:58.717
And right now, well, I worry

548
00:36:02.971 --> 00:36:04.931
that you're not
very nice anymore.

549
00:36:11.104 --> 00:36:12.481
Well, there's
nothing I can say to that.

550
00:36:12.523 --> 00:36:14.316
There is nothing you have to.

551
00:36:25.911 --> 00:36:27.580
I'm not going to argue with you.

552
00:36:27.621 --> 00:36:30.874
You can come and collect
your car when you're sober.

553
00:36:30.916 --> 00:36:34.169
You're being ridiculous. I mean,
you cannot confiscate my car key.

554
00:36:34.211 --> 00:36:36.338
Do not dare to
insult my intelligence!

555
00:36:38.131 --> 00:36:40.717
Now your mother loves you
very much. You know that.

556
00:36:40.759 --> 00:36:42.844
But for whatever time
she has left to her...

557
00:36:48.267 --> 00:36:53.730
If you ever, ever come to see
your mother in this state again,

558
00:36:53.772 --> 00:36:56.108
I will not let you in the house.

559
00:36:56.149 --> 00:36:57.817
I will close the door
in your face. Now...

560
00:37:01.238 --> 00:37:02.030
Go.

561
00:37:03.823 --> 00:37:04.950
Fine.

562
00:37:20.633 --> 00:37:24.052
You're not there. I just remembered
you're on a hot date tonight.

563
00:37:25.387 --> 00:37:27.055
I'm too late.

564
00:37:30.267 --> 00:37:31.768
Okay, can you call me
when you get this?

565
00:37:31.810 --> 00:37:33.979
It's just I need
to speak to someone.

566
00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:36.398
Not someone. You.

567
00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:42.821
A chainsaw for an arm.
It was mad.

568
00:37:42.862 --> 00:37:44.197
It's a work of timeless beauty.

569
00:37:44.239 --> 00:37:46.950
It's the finest of
the trilogy, methinks.

570
00:37:46.992 --> 00:37:49.828
And I still understood it without
seeing <i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white"> Evil Dead I</i> or <i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white"> Evil Dead II.</i>

571
00:37:49.869 --> 00:37:53.373
My only complaint would be
that there wasn't enough violence.

572
00:37:53.415 --> 00:37:56.960
You didn't mind, did you? Or did
you want to see <i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white"> Three Colors: Blue?</i>

573
00:37:57.002 --> 00:38:00.797
I'm gonna skip a starter
because I had those nachos,

574
00:38:00.839 --> 00:38:04.009
but you go ahead. You
can have anything you like.

575
00:38:06.011 --> 00:38:08.013
Anything up to
the value of, say, £14.00?

576
00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:12.184
No, no, seriously,
no, have anything.

577
00:38:12.225 --> 00:38:13.686
Well, you know, within reason.

578
00:38:16.689 --> 00:38:18.815
It's just so good
to see you again.

579
00:38:20.442 --> 00:38:22.653
And you're going to be
an amazing teacher.

580
00:38:22.695 --> 00:38:24.404
Congratulations. Thanks.

581
00:38:24.446 --> 00:38:26.865
I wish I'd had more
teachers like you.

582
00:38:26.906 --> 00:38:29.826
Not that I'd have got any
work done. Miss Morley.

583
00:38:37.376 --> 00:38:39.836
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">You have no new messages.</i>

584
00:38:46.885 --> 00:38:48.762
Comedy's a cruel mistress.

585
00:38:50.723 --> 00:38:52.641
Sometimes, Emma,
I think the only way

586
00:38:52.683 --> 00:38:53.684
I'm going to see
my name up in lights

587
00:38:53.726 --> 00:38:56.687
is if I change it
to Emergency Exit.

588
00:38:56.729 --> 00:39:01.441
Anyway, I'm doing an
improvisation night at the moment.

589
00:39:01.483 --> 00:39:03.443
Mr. Giggles. Not his real name.

590
00:39:03.485 --> 00:39:05.862
But I think I'm gonna stick to
the more observational material.

591
00:39:05.904 --> 00:39:07.280
I've got this whole
thing at the moment

592
00:39:07.322 --> 00:39:08.365
about the difference
between cats and dogs.

593
00:39:08.407 --> 00:39:10.367
Hey, please stop.

594
00:39:10.409 --> 00:39:11.660
Okay. Do you know
what the hardest thing

595
00:39:11.702 --> 00:39:12.869
about being
a stand-up comedian is?

596
00:39:12.911 --> 00:39:14.371
Is it the clothes?

597
00:39:14.413 --> 00:39:15.497
Very good. No.

598
00:39:16.915 --> 00:39:19.376
It's that people expect you
to be on all the time.

599
00:39:19.418 --> 00:39:21.169
Because if you're not being
funny, then what are you being?

600
00:39:21.211 --> 00:39:22.879
Ian, it's not a performance.

601
00:39:22.921 --> 00:39:25.090
Except it sort of is,
though, isn't it?

602
00:39:28.719 --> 00:39:31.221
I've been so excited about
seeing you. Like nervous.

603
00:39:40.146 --> 00:39:41.481
I'm sorry, I...

604
00:39:41.523 --> 00:39:42.691
I'm no good at
this stuff, either.

605
00:39:42.733 --> 00:39:45.944
It's just I graduated today.

606
00:39:45.985 --> 00:39:50.073
I'm finally, actually qualified
to do something useful,

607
00:39:50.115 --> 00:39:52.618
and I wanted to
celebrate with someone.

608
00:39:52.659 --> 00:39:53.577
Was Dexter busy?

609
00:40:01.752 --> 00:40:08.091
Em, when you hear this, can
you just get in a cab? And I'll pay.

610
00:40:08.133 --> 00:40:12.721
Maybe you could even stay over,
you know, on the sofa or something?

611
00:40:12.763 --> 00:40:15.307
I need to just see you.

612
00:40:15.348 --> 00:40:17.768
Please, can you just come over?

613
00:40:20.813 --> 00:40:22.731
Emma Morley? Hmm?

614
00:40:22.773 --> 00:40:23.690
Can I say something?

615
00:40:24.399 --> 00:40:25.567
Go on.

616
00:40:27.569 --> 00:40:31.740
I think you are
the absolute bollocks.

617
00:40:31.782 --> 00:40:33.492
You, with your honeyed words.

618
00:40:40.791 --> 00:40:42.751
I should probably head home.

619
00:40:42.793 --> 00:40:43.836
Don't go.
Let's go somewhere else.

620
00:40:46.379 --> 00:40:50.884
I live near, actually. I mean,
it's a dump, like, horrible.

621
00:40:50.925 --> 00:40:55.347
But I've got music and booze.

622
00:40:55.388 --> 00:40:56.181
Or a hot, milky drink
if you prefer.

623
00:40:57.516 --> 00:40:59.852
We could go on
an Ovaltine bender.

624
00:41:07.192 --> 00:41:10.779
All right. Okay.
One, two, three, go!

625
00:41:12.113 --> 00:41:13.406
Which way?

626
00:41:13.448 --> 00:41:14.449
This way, this way, this way!

627
00:41:27.253 --> 00:41:30.089
That's not needy.
That's just affection.

628
00:41:30.131 --> 00:41:32.551
I've just got
a lot of love to give.

629
00:41:37.347 --> 00:41:40.433
Well, if I can't call you,
can I come and see you?

630
00:41:44.437 --> 00:41:45.522
Do you know where
the matches are?

631
00:41:45.564 --> 00:41:47.482
No.

632
00:41:47.524 --> 00:41:49.735
You might wanna leave it
for a couple of minutes. Go.

633
00:41:57.659 --> 00:41:59.244
Hi, Miss Morley. Hi.

634
00:41:59.285 --> 00:42:01.538
There gonna be
a showbiz party afterwards

635
00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:04.499
with champagne, and canapés,
and the tinkle of laughter?

636
00:42:04.541 --> 00:42:07.544
It's a school play, Ian. I suspect
we'll be home by half 9:00.

637
00:42:07.586 --> 00:42:10.505
Why don't you stay at mine for a
change? I'll wash my duvet cover.

638
00:42:10.547 --> 00:42:11.631
Is that your boyfriend,
Miss Morley?

639
00:42:11.673 --> 00:42:13.132
Oy! Cheeky.

640
00:42:15.134 --> 00:42:17.637
Greetings, boys and girls.
Welcome to the <i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white"> Late Night Lock In.</i>

641
00:42:17.679 --> 00:42:19.848
Camera one, Dexter.

642
00:42:19.890 --> 00:42:21.850
The show that is late,
live and loud.

643
00:42:21.892 --> 00:42:23.643
Dexter, gentleman to see you.

644
00:42:23.685 --> 00:42:24.895
Mind the cables, sir.

645
00:42:24.937 --> 00:42:26.271
Hey. Okay, ladies.

646
00:42:31.109 --> 00:42:33.946
I helped myself to tea and buns.

647
00:42:33.987 --> 00:42:35.071
I hope I'm not going
to get you into trouble.

648
00:42:36.489 --> 00:42:37.783
I'm sure it'll be fine.

649
00:42:37.824 --> 00:42:39.451
There he is! Hey!

650
00:42:39.492 --> 00:42:42.537
Doesn't he look gorgeous?
Come to Suki.

651
00:42:42.579 --> 00:42:44.748
Suki Sue. Come here.

652
00:42:46.625 --> 00:42:50.086
I just want to eat you up.

653
00:42:52.756 --> 00:42:56.468
Suki, actually,
look, this is my father.

654
00:42:56.509 --> 00:42:58.470
Wotcha, Mr. M.

655
00:42:58.511 --> 00:43:00.680
Isn't your son gorgeous?

656
00:43:00.722 --> 00:43:02.098
Um, he's very nice.

657
00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:03.725
And where's Mrs. M?

658
00:43:05.852 --> 00:43:07.854
Sadly, she passed away.

659
00:43:11.524 --> 00:43:14.402
Barry, I need some water.

660
00:43:14.444 --> 00:43:16.362
What an appalling woman.

661
00:43:16.404 --> 00:43:18.573
Actually,
she's sort of my girlfriend.

662
00:43:18.615 --> 00:43:20.533
Oh, well, congratulations.

663
00:43:23.662 --> 00:43:26.539
Your mother would have been
most impressed.

664
00:43:29.459 --> 00:43:31.003
Thanks, Dad.

665
00:43:31.044 --> 00:43:32.545
I'll be watching at home
if I can stay awake.

666
00:43:33.338 --> 00:43:37.175
Have fun

667
00:43:37.216 --> 00:43:39.385
and don't take any notice of
what they say in the papers.

668
00:43:39.427 --> 00:43:41.179
Okay, sir. If you'd
like to come this way.

669
00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:42.180
Please.

670
00:43:44.223 --> 00:43:46.559
I'm the king of
car crash television.

671
00:43:46.601 --> 00:43:47.727
But you're the king of it.
That's good.

672
00:43:47.769 --> 00:43:49.437
Caption under photo. "Odious."

673
00:43:50.856 --> 00:43:52.315
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">Why can't you come again?</i>

674
00:43:52.357 --> 00:43:53.984
Because I'm working.

675
00:43:54.026 --> 00:43:55.568
I'll send a car to
come and pick you up.

676
00:43:55.610 --> 00:43:58.655
Dex, I can't.

677
00:43:58.697 --> 00:44:01.783
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">I know, and I'm sorry. <font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">I'm just so
much better <font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">when you're around.</i>

678
00:44:01.825 --> 00:44:03.576
Look, I'm just worried
I'm gonna be

679
00:44:03.618 --> 00:44:04.828
stood in front of
the camera thinking,

680
00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:06.746
"What's the bloody point?"

681
00:44:06.788 --> 00:44:08.874
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">The show's ridiculous.
<font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">I'm such a fraud, Em.</i>

682
00:44:08.915 --> 00:44:11.417
Hey, come on. That's enough.

683
00:44:11.459 --> 00:44:13.419
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">You know what you're doing.
<font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">You'll be fine.</i>

684
00:44:13.461 --> 00:44:15.005
Right.

685
00:44:15.047 --> 00:44:17.757
Just don't speak
in that weird voice, okay?

686
00:44:17.799 --> 00:44:19.551
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">Okay.</i> All right. Bye.

687
00:44:22.387 --> 00:44:23.805
Get ready. Here we go.

688
00:44:23.847 --> 00:44:25.473
Great stuff.
Let's move. Let's move!

689
00:44:25.515 --> 00:44:26.474
Okay, come on, guys. Let's go.

690
00:44:27.433 --> 00:44:29.811
We're on, superstar.

691
00:44:44.034 --> 00:44:47.245
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to <i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white"> Late Night Lock In.</i>

692
00:44:47.286 --> 00:44:49.081
The show that is late, live...

693
00:44:49.122 --> 00:44:51.583
And loud!

694
00:44:51.624 --> 00:44:53.085
And what a show
we've got for you tonight.

695
00:44:55.879 --> 00:44:57.089
Yay!

696
00:44:59.925 --> 00:45:01.342
Well done, darling.

697
00:45:02.677 --> 00:45:03.845
Thank you.

698
00:45:03.887 --> 00:45:05.805
Come on, Miss Morley.

699
00:45:05.847 --> 00:45:07.057
Bravo!

700
00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:21.320
The Maxi Crew, ladies and
gentlemen. The Maxi Crew.

701
00:45:21.362 --> 00:45:26.076
All right, take a seat, fellas. Take
a seat. You can sit down there.

702
00:45:26.118 --> 00:45:30.872
Right, guys, I just wanna start
by saying that that jam was fresh.

703
00:45:30.914 --> 00:45:34.542
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">Right, okay, <font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">so let's kick it off
with... <font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">Let's ask some questions.</i>

704
00:45:34.584 --> 00:45:37.754
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">What is hip hop? <font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">Is this
the voice <font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">from the street?</i>

705
00:45:37.796 --> 00:45:40.465
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">Is this why you guys
<font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">are just so angry?</i>

706
00:45:40.506 --> 00:45:42.050
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">No, dawg.</i>

707
00:45:42.092 --> 00:45:43.635
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">It's chill,
<font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">it's chill, it's chill.</i>

708
00:45:46.805 --> 00:45:50.558
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">Right, okay. Listen,
<font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">can you rap about anything?</i>

709
00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:53.061
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">For example, could you rap
<font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">about a cheese sandwich?</i>

710
00:45:53.103 --> 00:45:55.313
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white"> Are you new here?
<font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">Have you done this before?</i>

711
00:45:57.523 --> 00:46:00.359
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white"> Oh, dear.
<font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">Do not try this at home.</i>

712
00:46:05.949 --> 00:46:07.659
Ian?

713
00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:09.119
Do you think you'll
finish painting today?

714
00:46:09.161 --> 00:46:11.997
I'd like to at least
get the TV back inside.

715
00:46:12.038 --> 00:46:14.457
All right, all right. I can
have breakfast first, can't I?

716
00:46:14.499 --> 00:46:15.750
We've had breakfast.

717
00:46:15.792 --> 00:46:18.544
All right, brunch, then.

718
00:46:18.586 --> 00:46:20.922
Brunch. Is it lunch?
Is it breakfast?

719
00:46:20.964 --> 00:46:22.674
No, it's brunch.
What about brinner, say?

720
00:46:22.715 --> 00:46:24.467
Or brupper?

721
00:46:24.509 --> 00:46:26.094
Well, I should get on.

722
00:46:26.136 --> 00:46:27.887
Bearhug, snootch?

723
00:46:27.929 --> 00:46:30.140
I thought we agreed
about snootch?

724
00:46:30.182 --> 00:46:32.934
I can't seem to say anything
right these days, can I?

725
00:46:34.727 --> 00:46:36.021
Look, if you don't
want me to go tonight...

726
00:46:36.062 --> 00:46:38.106
No, you should go.

727
00:46:38.148 --> 00:46:40.316
Or if you wanted
to come with us...

728
00:46:40.358 --> 00:46:42.235
What? Dexter ignoring me, and
you talking over me? No, thank you.

729
00:46:42.276 --> 00:46:43.528
It won't be like that.

730
00:46:43.569 --> 00:46:44.904
Anyway, I've got a gig tonight

731
00:46:44.946 --> 00:46:46.489
at The Rose & Crown,
Sir Laffalots.

732
00:46:46.531 --> 00:46:48.574
Paid gig?

733
00:46:48.616 --> 00:46:50.160
No.

734
00:46:50.202 --> 00:46:51.911
Better get back to it then.

735
00:46:51.953 --> 00:46:54.330
Thirty-four identical essays
on <i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white"> Lord of the Flies.</i>

736
00:46:54.372 --> 00:46:59.085
Em? About 1700 hours, do
you fancy a little bit of the old...

737
00:47:00.628 --> 00:47:02.421
You know, afternoon delight?

738
00:47:20.606 --> 00:47:21.566
Wow!

739
00:47:22.608 --> 00:47:23.985
You look incredible.

740
00:47:24.027 --> 00:47:25.945
Oh... Ooh!

741
00:47:25.987 --> 00:47:27.488
Let's see the dress.

742
00:47:29.407 --> 00:47:30.575
Is it vintage?

743
00:47:30.616 --> 00:47:31.826
No, it's brand new.

744
00:47:31.868 --> 00:47:33.578
Really? Mmm.

745
00:47:33.619 --> 00:47:36.164
Well, you look great,
and I love the shoes.

746
00:47:36.206 --> 00:47:39.209
Thank you. It's the world's
first orthopedic high heel.

747
00:47:39.251 --> 00:47:42.587
Look, it's been too long, Em.

748
00:47:42.628 --> 00:47:45.590
I need to have some fun
tonight. Can we have fun, please?

749
00:47:45.631 --> 00:47:46.132
God, sorry.

750
00:47:48.593 --> 00:47:49.427
Look, I'll be two seconds.
It's work.

751
00:47:49.468 --> 00:47:50.762
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white"> I'm naked!</i>

752
00:47:50.803 --> 00:47:52.097
Suki, you nutter.

753
00:47:52.138 --> 00:47:53.890
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">Where are you, baby?</i>

754
00:47:53.932 --> 00:47:54.724
I thought you were
supposed to be at the party.

755
00:47:56.226 --> 00:47:58.311
You do know they
damage your brain?

756
00:47:58.352 --> 00:48:00.063
They do not damage your brain.

757
00:48:00.105 --> 00:48:02.023
How can you tell?

758
00:48:02.065 --> 00:48:04.109
Ha ha, very funny, Em.

759
00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:06.569
I guarantee you, one year, one
year, and you'll have one of these.

760
00:48:06.611 --> 00:48:09.989
You're on. If I ever get a mobile
phone, you can buy me dinner.

761
00:48:10.031 --> 00:48:11.657
What, again?

762
00:48:13.618 --> 00:48:17.038
So, come on.
How's the king of comedy?

763
00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:19.415
Oh, Ian's fine. We both are.

764
00:48:19.457 --> 00:48:21.500
Are you still very much in love?

765
00:48:21.542 --> 00:48:25.130
He can belch the theme to <i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white"> The
A-Team.</i> I'm only flesh and blood.

766
00:48:25.171 --> 00:48:28.591
I don't know. These days,
we don't seem to...

767
00:48:28.633 --> 00:48:31.594
And how's the new place?
How's that?

768
00:48:31.636 --> 00:48:35.140
Flat's fine. Well, it's a room
and a half in murder mile.

769
00:48:35.181 --> 00:48:36.808
And Ian's been
talking about painting

770
00:48:36.849 --> 00:48:39.018
the same wall
for the past six months.

771
00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:41.854
But it's got potential.
There's a view. The Gasworks.

772
00:48:44.065 --> 00:48:45.650
You should come round.

773
00:48:45.691 --> 00:48:47.068
Mmm! Mmm.

774
00:48:51.489 --> 00:48:53.616
How's Suki?

775
00:48:53.658 --> 00:48:56.286
Oh, she's fantastic.
Yeah, gorgeous.

776
00:48:56.328 --> 00:48:58.246
What's great for me is that she
really understands the industry.

777
00:48:58.288 --> 00:48:59.998
You know, she knows exactly
what it's like to be...

778
00:49:02.541 --> 00:49:04.961
I was gonna say "famous."
God, we hate the word.

779
00:49:05.003 --> 00:49:06.671
Every time I turn on the telly,

780
00:49:06.712 --> 00:49:08.089
she's there in
a pink rubber catsuit.

781
00:49:08.131 --> 00:49:09.841
She's doing incredibly well.

782
00:49:09.882 --> 00:49:11.634
Yeah, yeah.

783
00:49:11.676 --> 00:49:14.929
Well, we both are.

784
00:49:14.971 --> 00:49:18.099
I've got some really, really
exciting stuff coming up.

785
00:49:18.141 --> 00:49:19.725
It's all sort of in development.

786
00:49:19.767 --> 00:49:21.644
If I told you,
I'd have to shoot you.

787
00:49:21.686 --> 00:49:22.770
Please do.

788
00:49:25.523 --> 00:49:28.234
Never mind.
Start without me, all right?

789
00:49:44.917 --> 00:49:46.127
Hello.

790
00:49:46.169 --> 00:49:48.338
There you are. Enjoy.

791
00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:50.673
What are you doing,
you silly thing?

792
00:49:50.715 --> 00:49:52.133
Well, listen, we'll talk later.

793
00:49:55.761 --> 00:49:58.097
Look at this.
This looks gorgeous.

794
00:49:58.139 --> 00:50:00.141
Are you all right?
Maybe she could join us?

795
00:50:00.183 --> 00:50:04.229
Hey, hey, hey, what's this?
I'm here to see you, remember?

796
00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:07.315
Right, well, how's the teaching?

797
00:50:07.357 --> 00:50:09.401
What? If you're not
interested, don't ask.

798
00:50:09.442 --> 00:50:11.777
I am interested.

799
00:50:11.819 --> 00:50:13.738
I just thought you were going
to be writing this novel, that's all.

800
00:50:13.779 --> 00:50:16.324
And I will.
But I have to earn a living.

801
00:50:16.366 --> 00:50:18.201
More to the point, I enjoy it. I'm
a bloody good teacher, Dexter.

802
00:50:18.243 --> 00:50:20.912
I'm sure you are.

803
00:50:20.953 --> 00:50:21.996
Still, you know what they say?

804
00:50:22.038 --> 00:50:23.998
No, what do they say?

805
00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:26.542
You know, "Those who can..."

806
00:50:26.584 --> 00:50:29.795
No, I'm sorry. I'm not
familiar. Finish the sentence.

807
00:50:31.964 --> 00:50:34.926
All right.
Well, "Those who can, do,

808
00:50:34.967 --> 00:50:37.303
"and those who can't, teach."

809
00:50:40.681 --> 00:50:43.101
And those who can teach say,
"Go fuck yourself!"

810
00:50:45.644 --> 00:50:48.564
Em! Em, come on. Look,
whatever I've done, I'm sorry.

811
00:50:48.606 --> 00:50:49.982
You've obviously
had a bit too much to drink.

812
00:50:50.024 --> 00:50:52.735
No, you're drunk! You're drunk!

813
00:50:52.777 --> 00:50:56.155
Do you realize that I have literally
not seen you sober for three years?

814
00:50:56.197 --> 00:50:58.074
Nipping off to
the toilet every 10 minutes.

815
00:50:58.116 --> 00:51:00.368
Either you're on coke,
or you've got dysentery.

816
00:51:00.410 --> 00:51:02.954
Either way, it's boring! Banging
on about yourself all the time.

817
00:51:02.995 --> 00:51:06.749
Well, I wouldn't mind, Dex, but
you're a TV presenter, all right?

818
00:51:06.791 --> 00:51:08.376
You've not invented penicillin.

819
00:51:08.418 --> 00:51:10.044
All you do is stand around
shouting, "Make some noise!"

820
00:51:10.086 --> 00:51:12.380
Look, I am having fun,
that's all.

821
00:51:12.422 --> 00:51:14.590
I've been through
a lot recently.

822
00:51:14.632 --> 00:51:15.967
I might get a bit carried away,

823
00:51:16.008 --> 00:51:17.093
but if you wouldn't
stop getting at me...

824
00:51:17.135 --> 00:51:19.762
Am I? I don't mean to, and I...

825
00:51:19.804 --> 00:51:23.224
I know that you've been through
a lot with your mum and all, I know.

826
00:51:23.266 --> 00:51:27.186
But, there are things that I
needed to talk to you about.

827
00:51:27.228 --> 00:51:31.524
About how I am
stuck in this flat

828
00:51:31.565 --> 00:51:33.526
with a man that I am
not in love with.

829
00:51:33.567 --> 00:51:37.780
And if I can't talk to you, then
what is the point of you? Of us?

830
00:51:37.822 --> 00:51:39.282
What do you mean,
"What's the point?"

831
00:51:39.324 --> 00:51:41.242
I think we've
outgrown each other.

832
00:51:41.284 --> 00:51:44.412
No, you have outgrown me.
You think I'm uncool and dreary.

833
00:51:44.454 --> 00:51:46.622
I don't think
you're dreary. Em...

834
00:51:46.664 --> 00:51:50.876
I think if it's over, then we should
just face facts. Say goodbye.

835
00:51:50.918 --> 00:51:52.211
It sounds like
you're dumping me.

836
00:51:52.253 --> 00:51:53.921
Yeah, maybe I am.

837
00:51:53.963 --> 00:51:55.714
You're not who you used to be.

838
00:51:55.756 --> 00:51:58.384
Come on, Em. Look, I apologize!

839
00:51:59.885 --> 00:52:01.053
Please.

840
00:52:07.685 --> 00:52:09.270
Come on. That's it.

841
00:52:11.356 --> 00:52:12.648
There.

842
00:52:14.859 --> 00:52:18.404
I love you, Dexter. So much.

843
00:52:21.699 --> 00:52:23.909
I just don't like you anymore.

844
00:52:24.618 --> 00:52:26.538
I'm sorry.

845
00:53:02.574 --> 00:53:04.950
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white"> Johnny Cage wins.</i>

846
00:53:04.992 --> 00:53:07.870
That's an almighty win
from the Blade Cruisers there.

847
00:53:07.912 --> 00:53:10.748
I think you'll all agree.
Well done, guys.

848
00:53:10.789 --> 00:53:14.001
That's all from tonight's <i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white"> Joy
Stick Jockeys.</i> Join us next week

849
00:53:14.043 --> 00:53:17.589
when we review the smoking hot
new console games coming at you.

850
00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:20.341
Until then, night owls,
keep gaming.

851
00:53:25.763 --> 00:53:28.140
Do I really have to
say "smoking hot"?

852
00:53:30.393 --> 00:53:32.728
It's just I'm 32,
for God's sake.

853
00:53:35.022 --> 00:53:36.982
What, they're sacking me?

854
00:53:37.024 --> 00:53:39.402
You see, sack has
negative connotations.

855
00:53:39.444 --> 00:53:41.737
It's just they wanna
try a new presenter.

856
00:53:43.155 --> 00:53:45.324
So they are sacking me?

857
00:53:45.366 --> 00:53:47.118
Well, no, they're taking the
show in a different direction,

858
00:53:47.159 --> 00:53:50.162
but it's a direction
away from you.

859
00:53:50.204 --> 00:53:51.456
Okay, so less you now.

860
00:53:51.497 --> 00:53:52.624
Okay.

861
00:53:52.665 --> 00:53:54.166
More you in your 20s.

862
00:53:57.044 --> 00:53:59.547
Right. Right.

863
00:53:59.589 --> 00:54:01.340
So, what's the good news?

864
00:54:01.382 --> 00:54:04.343
Sorry?

865
00:54:04.385 --> 00:54:07.680
Well, you said you had some
bad news. What's the good news?

866
00:54:14.895 --> 00:54:17.398
Every career has
its ups and downs.

867
00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:20.067
This is just
a bloody great down.

868
00:54:20.109 --> 00:54:21.694
And I sense a bit of
disenchantment, Dexy.

869
00:54:21.735 --> 00:54:24.155
Just a little concerned
about my future.

870
00:54:24.196 --> 00:54:27.241
It's not quite
what I was expecting.

871
00:54:27.283 --> 00:54:30.536
The future never is. That's
what makes it so bloody exciting!

872
00:54:32.538 --> 00:54:35.249
Everyone loves you, yeah?

873
00:54:35.291 --> 00:54:39.170
But they love you in that
ironic, love-to-hate kind of way.

874
00:54:39.211 --> 00:54:40.963
Right?
And all that we need to do

875
00:54:41.005 --> 00:54:42.715
is just find someone
that loves you for real.

876
00:54:45.635 --> 00:54:46.844
Okay? Yeah.

877
00:54:52.016 --> 00:54:53.225
I love you, Sylvie.

878
00:54:54.935 --> 00:54:58.189
No, no, wait.
No, I'm in love with you.

879
00:54:58.230 --> 00:55:01.233
Look, I've never said
this to anyone before.

880
00:55:01.275 --> 00:55:02.652
Well, that's a lie. Um...

881
00:55:04.696 --> 00:55:06.447
I love you, Sylvie. I...

882
00:55:10.242 --> 00:55:13.621
Sylvie tells me you used
to be quite well known.

883
00:55:13.663 --> 00:55:15.707
TV presenter or something.

884
00:55:15.748 --> 00:55:18.751
I did. Yeah. Once upon a time.

885
00:55:18.792 --> 00:55:22.213
Yes, on <i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white"> Larginit.</i> That program.
Do you remember, Mummy?

886
00:55:22.254 --> 00:55:23.297
You used to really hate it.

887
00:55:23.339 --> 00:55:24.549
Yes.

888
00:55:24.590 --> 00:55:26.509
"Turn it off," she used to say.

889
00:55:26.551 --> 00:55:28.636
"Turn it off. It's
killing your brain cells."

890
00:55:28.678 --> 00:55:30.638
That was you, was it?

891
00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:32.557
You still work
in television, Dexter?

892
00:55:32.598 --> 00:55:35.893
Not so much, no. That
sort of drifted away, really.

893
00:55:35.934 --> 00:55:37.645
Uh-huh.

894
00:55:37.687 --> 00:55:40.898
Dexter's just being modest.
He gets lots of offers.

895
00:55:40.939 --> 00:55:42.316
Anyway, what he really
wants to do is produce.

896
00:55:45.944 --> 00:55:46.945
Party games.

897
00:55:50.824 --> 00:55:52.034
Are you there, Moriarty?

898
00:55:52.076 --> 00:55:53.285
Here.

899
00:55:55.079 --> 00:55:56.372
Two for two, nice work, bro.

900
00:55:56.414 --> 00:55:57.373
Going for a hat trick.

901
00:55:57.415 --> 00:55:59.458
Are you there, Moriarty?

902
00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:00.418
Here.

903
00:56:04.797 --> 00:56:05.798
The crowd goes wild!

904
00:56:07.216 --> 00:56:09.260
There's my boy!

905
00:56:09.301 --> 00:56:10.595
Better luck next
time, son. Thank you.

906
00:56:10.636 --> 00:56:12.638
Well, I'm still
very proud of you.

907
00:56:14.599 --> 00:56:16.392
Oh, isn't this fun?

908
00:56:16.434 --> 00:56:18.477
Dexter, care to
take me on? Oh, no.

909
00:56:18.519 --> 00:56:19.520
That's a terrific idea.

910
00:56:19.562 --> 00:56:20.688
Darling, are you sure?

911
00:56:20.730 --> 00:56:23.148
Yes, I'm sure.

912
00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:24.734
Come on, chap.
Pick up your weapon.

913
00:56:24.776 --> 00:56:26.402
Nice and tight, Mum.

914
00:56:29.029 --> 00:56:31.073
- All right?
- All right.

915
00:56:31.115 --> 00:56:33.075
Very good. We don't
want you cheating.

916
00:56:33.117 --> 00:56:34.952
Good luck. All right.

917
00:56:34.993 --> 00:56:36.537
Come on, sis.

918
00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:45.797
All right, ready?

919
00:56:45.838 --> 00:56:48.006
As ready as I'll...

920
00:56:48.048 --> 00:56:51.761
Good God, man! What the
hell do you think you're doing?

921
00:56:51.803 --> 00:56:53.512
That table was from
Italy. I'm so sorry.

922
00:56:53.554 --> 00:56:55.973
I must have just caught her
at a funny angle there.

923
00:56:56.014 --> 00:56:59.184
You didn't even ask
if she was there, Moriarty.

924
00:56:59.226 --> 00:57:02.229
I know. I know. I'm so sorry. Look,
I don't know what I was thinking.

925
00:57:02.271 --> 00:57:03.564
Wanker!

926
00:57:16.577 --> 00:57:18.746
Serves me right
for not changing the locks.

927
00:57:18.788 --> 00:57:20.122
Looking good, Ian.

928
00:57:20.164 --> 00:57:21.373
You can get stuffed, Emma.

929
00:57:21.415 --> 00:57:23.375
Is that from your act?

930
00:57:23.417 --> 00:57:25.544
No, though I have got this
new thing I've been working on.

931
00:57:25.586 --> 00:57:27.588
God.

932
00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:30.048
I come on, and I say, "Here's
a funny story. You'll like this."

933
00:57:30.090 --> 00:57:33.135
Ian. "There's this guy,

934
00:57:33.177 --> 00:57:35.971
"and he's going out with
this girl, and he worships her,

935
00:57:36.013 --> 00:57:38.850
"and they buy
this flat together.

936
00:57:38.891 --> 00:57:42.019
"And then he gets her
an engagement ring, the lot.

937
00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:47.065
"It turns out that she is still
in love with her best friend."

938
00:57:47.107 --> 00:57:49.652
Interesting theory, Ian, except
I've not seen Dexter for ages.

939
00:57:49.694 --> 00:57:52.154
No? That is not the reason.

940
00:57:52.196 --> 00:57:56.367
Do you know how he found out
about it? He read it in her poetry.

941
00:57:56.408 --> 00:57:58.035
You bastard!

942
00:57:58.076 --> 00:57:59.995
Give it back to me!
"Our graduation night!

943
00:58:00.037 --> 00:58:02.289
"The erotic intensity
of the shared bed."

944
00:58:02.331 --> 00:58:05.710
"That magic week in France."
It's all here in blank verse.

945
00:58:05.751 --> 00:58:07.837
If you ever, ever, come in
here again I will call the police!

946
00:58:07.879 --> 00:58:09.296
Call the bloody police!
It's my flat, too!

947
00:58:09.338 --> 00:58:12.049
Is it? I paid the mortgage!

948
00:58:12.090 --> 00:58:15.177
You just sat around farting and
watching the bloody <i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white"> Wrath of Khan!</i>

949
00:58:15.219 --> 00:58:16.428
You love <i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white"> The Wrath of Khan.</i>

950
00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:18.764
I hate <i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white"> The Wrath of Khan.</i>

951
00:58:23.310 --> 00:58:25.437
It's a good job
we didn't get married.

952
00:58:29.149 --> 00:58:31.736
I'm sorry about going
through all your stuff.

953
00:58:31.777 --> 00:58:34.029
I've just been a bit mad
recently, that's all.

954
00:58:34.071 --> 00:58:35.531
It's all right.

955
00:58:38.659 --> 00:58:40.745
I miss you.

956
00:58:40.786 --> 00:58:42.079
I know you do.

957
00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:43.873
Like, right here.

958
00:58:48.669 --> 00:58:51.255
Either that, or it's
trapped wind. I'm not sure.

959
00:58:51.296 --> 00:58:53.424
Either way, it'll pass.

960
00:58:53.465 --> 00:58:55.634
It's good, by the way.

961
00:58:55.676 --> 00:58:58.512
Not the poems.
The poems are awful,

962
00:58:58.554 --> 00:59:02.057
but the rest of the stuff,
the stories. You're funny.

963
00:59:02.099 --> 00:59:04.101
Proper funny.

964
00:59:04.142 --> 00:59:05.937
Not like me. Ian.

965
00:59:05.978 --> 00:59:07.354
No, I'm just saying that you
should show them to someone,

966
00:59:07.396 --> 00:59:09.690
because you're
better than you know.

967
00:59:24.288 --> 00:59:25.372
Oh!

968
01:00:34.566 --> 01:00:37.528
So that's Emma Morley. We
went to university together.

969
01:00:37.569 --> 01:00:38.654
Did you sleep with her as well?

970
01:00:38.696 --> 01:00:40.155
No.

971
01:00:40.197 --> 01:00:41.532
What about the bride?

972
01:00:41.573 --> 01:00:42.658
No. God, what is this?

973
01:00:44.910 --> 01:00:48.246
It's just that every weekend
we go to a wedding

974
01:00:48.288 --> 01:00:50.541
with a coachload of people
that you've slept with.

975
01:00:50.582 --> 01:00:51.959
It's like a conference.

976
01:00:52.001 --> 01:00:53.961
Okay. Come on.

977
01:00:54.003 --> 01:00:55.546
You know you're
the only one for me now.

978
01:00:55.587 --> 01:00:57.464
You are. Come on,
come here. Come here.

979
01:01:03.261 --> 01:01:05.556
Hummus wraps. Organic smoothies.

980
01:01:05.597 --> 01:01:07.016
Fair Trade coffees.

981
01:01:09.476 --> 01:01:12.479
Crayfish. Dex, people go crazy
for the little buggers.

982
01:01:15.232 --> 01:01:18.777
I've got 12 branches already.
Twelve more by the end of the year.

983
01:01:18.819 --> 01:01:20.278
Well, you know,
there's a rumor going around

984
01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:21.446
that you're actually
a multi millionaire.

985
01:01:21.488 --> 01:01:23.032
Come on.

986
01:01:24.075 --> 01:01:25.492
Well, define multi.

987
01:01:30.288 --> 01:01:32.624
You should come and
have lunch. We should talk.

988
01:01:32.666 --> 01:01:34.043
What, are you offering me a job?

989
01:01:34.085 --> 01:01:36.003
No, I'm just saying...

990
01:01:36.045 --> 01:01:38.422
You are, aren't you?
You're offering me a job.

991
01:01:38.463 --> 01:01:40.883
Look, I haven't seen you
on telly for a while.

992
01:01:40.925 --> 01:01:43.010
I thought if you
wanted a fresh start...

993
01:01:43.052 --> 01:01:45.470
Callum, mate. Mate, mate, mate.

994
01:01:45.512 --> 01:01:48.015
At university, you wore
the same pair of jeans for...

995
01:01:48.057 --> 01:01:49.516
What was it, four years?

996
01:01:50.976 --> 01:01:52.477
Long time ago now, pal.

997
01:01:54.521 --> 01:01:56.314
We're not students anymore.

998
01:01:56.356 --> 01:01:57.441
Someone seems to be enjoying it.

999
01:01:57.482 --> 01:01:58.901
Look, look over here.

1000
01:01:58.943 --> 01:02:00.611
Have you seen Emma Morley?

1001
01:02:00.652 --> 01:02:02.571
Right under our noses
all this time. Eh?

1002
01:02:03.655 --> 01:02:04.782
Who knew?

1003
01:02:06.658 --> 01:02:09.620

01:02:22.674 --> 01:02:24.885
I tell you, the one
discovery changed my life.

1008
01:02:26.095 --> 01:02:28.889
Crayfish.

1009
01:02:28.931 --> 01:02:32.267
I've got 12 branches already.
Another 12 by the end of the year.

1010
01:02:32.309 --> 01:02:33.727
I was telling Dexter there's
plenty of opportunities.

1011
01:02:33.769 --> 01:02:35.562
Darling, I'll be back in a bit.

1012
01:02:38.983 --> 01:02:40.692
Do you want some champagne?

1013
01:02:40.734 --> 01:02:42.569
It's not champagne.
It's Spanish.

1018
01:02:59.711 --> 01:03:00.587
Do you want to get out of here?

1019
01:03:00.629 --> 01:03:02.297
Yes, please.

1022
01:03:10.639 --> 01:03:13.391
Today must be quite tough for
you, having slept with the bride.

1023
01:03:15.435 --> 01:03:17.896
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1024
01:03:17.938 --> 01:03:21.399
What? How do you
know all these things?

1025
01:03:21.441 --> 01:03:23.485
Tilly told me all about it.
Oh, did she?

1026
01:03:23.527 --> 01:03:26.321
The foot massage
spun out of control.

1027
01:03:26.363 --> 01:03:29.158
I think you even
used my olive oil.

1028
01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:31.160
Footprints halfway
up the kitchen wall.

1029
01:03:32.410 --> 01:03:34.997
Well, that stuff's
behind me now, so...

1030
01:03:35.039 --> 01:03:36.707
Really, what happened?

1031
01:03:36.748 --> 01:03:39.543
Sex in toilet cubicles
lose its bittersweet charm?

1032
01:03:39.584 --> 01:03:42.337
Well, an orgy won't keep you
warm at night, Emma.

1033
01:03:42.379 --> 01:03:43.588
An orgy won't look after you
when you're old.

1034
01:03:43.630 --> 01:03:44.798
Well said.

1035
01:03:48.677 --> 01:03:51.805
Anyway, I screwed up my career.

1036
01:03:51.847 --> 01:03:53.431
And screwed up things with Mum.

1037
01:03:55.184 --> 01:03:56.977
That's not true.

1038
01:03:58.478 --> 01:04:00.272
And I screwed up my friendships.

1039
01:04:03.692 --> 01:04:06.778
And then Sylvie just came along.

1040
01:04:09.573 --> 01:04:11.825
And she sort of,
well, saved me, really.

1041
01:04:13.493 --> 01:04:15.829
She's very beautiful.

1042
01:04:15.871 --> 01:04:19.166
Of course, she has absolutely
no sense of humor.

1043
01:04:19.208 --> 01:04:21.543
Just as well. A sense
of humor's overrated.

1044
01:04:21.585 --> 01:04:24.004
Goofing around all the time.

1045
01:04:24.046 --> 01:04:26.173
The only time Ian
ever really made me laugh

1046
01:04:26.215 --> 01:04:28.050
was when he fell
down the stairs.

1047
01:04:28.092 --> 01:04:30.886
Well, you know, Sylvie
says she doesn't like to laugh.

1048
01:04:30.928 --> 01:04:33.471
Doesn't really like
what it does to her face.

1049
01:04:39.228 --> 01:04:40.729
But you love her, right?

1050
01:04:45.150 --> 01:04:46.610
Yeah, I worship her.

1051
01:04:47.652 --> 01:04:53.408
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">I'm loving Colin instead</i>

1052
01:04:58.289 --> 01:05:00.582
Oh, no, no. This way.

1053
01:05:00.624 --> 01:05:01.666
Where are we going?

1054
01:05:02.834 --> 01:05:03.668
Dex?

1055
01:05:07.714 --> 01:05:08.757
Oh!

1056
01:05:12.510 --> 01:05:14.805
So, come on, then. You, huh?

1057
01:05:14.846 --> 01:05:16.598
Any romance?

1058
01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:18.058
Don't start, Dex.

1059
01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:19.601
What?

1060
01:05:19.643 --> 01:05:23.314
Your sympathy.
I'm not lonely. I'm alone.

1061
01:05:23.355 --> 01:05:25.232
There, how'd that sound?

1062
01:05:25.274 --> 01:05:27.109
Yeah, yeah. I bought that.

1063
01:05:27.151 --> 01:05:28.110
It's true.

1064
01:05:31.322 --> 01:05:33.531
I've got a tiny advance
to write this book.

1065
01:05:34.283 --> 01:05:35.742
Em!

1066
01:05:35.784 --> 01:05:36.743
Mmm-hmm.

1067
01:05:41.206 --> 01:05:44.001
Well, you know, I have
something to tell you, too.

1068
01:05:50.590 --> 01:05:52.176
You're getting married.

1069
01:05:52.217 --> 01:05:53.593
Yeah.

1070
01:05:59.224 --> 01:06:00.767
So, you're pleased?

1071
01:06:00.809 --> 01:06:03.312
Of course I'm pleased, Dex.
Fantastic news, really.

1072
01:06:06.315 --> 01:06:09.151
Scented? Your wedding
invitations are scented.

1073
01:06:09.193 --> 01:06:11.653
Yeah, lavender.

1074
01:06:11.695 --> 01:06:13.989
No, Dex, it's money.
They smell of money.

1075
01:06:19.703 --> 01:06:21.788
August 14th?

1076
01:06:21.830 --> 01:06:24.499
Yeah, I think that's what
they call a shotgun wedding.

1077
01:06:25.959 --> 01:06:27.752
For 350.

1078
01:06:29.713 --> 01:06:30.922
With buffet.

1079
01:06:43.435 --> 01:06:44.602
Do you know who the father is?

1080
01:06:44.644 --> 01:06:46.146
Stop it.

1081
01:06:46.188 --> 01:06:48.106
I'm kidding.

1082
01:06:48.148 --> 01:06:49.191
Congratulations.

1083
01:06:49.233 --> 01:06:50.401
Thank you.

1084
01:06:50.442 --> 01:06:51.609
A dad. I know.

1085
01:06:53.028 --> 01:06:55.113
Is that allowed?
Will they let you?

1086
01:06:55.155 --> 01:06:57.408
It's incredible, isn't it?

1087
01:06:57.449 --> 01:07:00.411
You're going to be
a wonderful father.

1088
01:07:00.452 --> 01:07:02.120
Do you really think so?

1089
01:07:02.162 --> 01:07:03.372
I don't doubt it for a minute.

1090
01:07:14.507 --> 01:07:16.009
I missed you, Dex.

1091
01:07:18.511 --> 01:07:20.013
Well, I missed you, too.

1092
01:07:29.981 --> 01:07:31.483
No more disappearing.

1093
01:07:33.693 --> 01:07:35.404
No, well, I won't if you won't.

1094
01:07:37.114 --> 01:07:38.115
Mmm? Mmm.

1095
01:07:51.002 --> 01:07:52.003
Dex?

1096
01:07:53.922 --> 01:07:55.215
We should go.

1097
01:07:58.009 --> 01:07:59.470
Absolutely, let's go.

1098
01:08:06.643 --> 01:08:08.228
Come on, Jasmine. Come on.

1099
01:08:11.231 --> 01:08:13.233
Come on. You gonna stop crying?

1100
01:08:34.587 --> 01:08:36.006
How you getting on?

1101
01:08:36.047 --> 01:08:38.049
Good, mate.
Good. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1102
01:08:38.091 --> 01:08:39.217
Not quite what
I was expecting, but...

1103
01:08:39.259 --> 01:08:40.635
How do you mean?

1104
01:08:40.677 --> 01:08:43.805
Well, you see the words
organic and homemade...

1105
01:08:43.847 --> 01:08:45.849
Yeah, I know. You
imagined a couple of hippies

1106
01:08:45.890 --> 01:08:48.643
on a little farm somewhere,
knitting their own muesli.

1107
01:08:48.685 --> 01:08:50.812
Nice idea,
but this is business, Dex.

1108
01:08:50.854 --> 01:08:54.065
Yeah, well, I realize that.
Here's your last two.

1109
01:08:54.107 --> 01:08:57.902
Listen, mate. You're only
here to learn the ropes, okay?

1110
01:08:57.944 --> 01:08:59.237
Company policy. Everyone has to.

1111
01:08:59.279 --> 01:09:01.490
Callum, I'm enjoying it.

1112
01:09:01.532 --> 01:09:02.657
Honestly, I'm good.

1113
01:09:04.993 --> 01:09:07.037
There's plenty of formula left.

1114
01:09:07.078 --> 01:09:10.457
I've pureed the veggies,
or you could mash a banana.

1115
01:09:10.499 --> 01:09:13.710
And what about Indian food?
I can give her a curry, can't I?

1116
01:09:13.751 --> 01:09:16.046
No, no, no, Dexter. No.

1117
01:09:16.087 --> 01:09:17.381
Sylvie, I'm joking.

1118
01:09:17.422 --> 01:09:18.965
Oh, I see.

1119
01:09:19.007 --> 01:09:20.925
I keep missing those, don't I?

1120
01:09:20.967 --> 01:09:22.886
I'm sorry.
It's just that I'm late.

1121
01:09:22.927 --> 01:09:24.721
I don't even know why I'm going.

1122
01:09:24.762 --> 01:09:26.264
I'm too old for hen nights.
No, you're not.

1123
01:09:26.306 --> 01:09:27.558
That's my cab.

1124
01:09:27.599 --> 01:09:28.850
Right, come on, then.

1125
01:09:28.892 --> 01:09:29.934
I'll be back tomorrow morning.

1126
01:09:29.976 --> 01:09:31.895
Okay.

1127
01:09:31.936 --> 01:09:33.522
Be good. Try not to
burn the house down.

1128
01:09:33.564 --> 01:09:34.189
I'll be fine. I'll be fine.

1129
01:09:38.193 --> 01:09:40.487
Goodbye, my sweetheart.
Say goodbye to Mummy.

1130
01:09:40.529 --> 01:09:42.113
Say goodbye to Mummy.

1131
01:09:42.155 --> 01:09:44.449
Oh, I know, honey.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1132
01:09:47.411 --> 01:09:48.786
Have a good time.

1133

<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">But, you know, <font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">I'm working on it,
all right? <font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">So bear with me. That's all.</i>

1176
01:12:08.677 --> 01:12:09.927
I've got to go.

1177
01:12:11.888 --> 01:12:13.765
I'll see you tomorrow.
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">All right.</i>

1178
01:12:13.806 --> 01:12:15.266
Night. <i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">Good night.</i>

1179
01:13:18.329 --> 01:13:19.414
Funny?

1180
01:13:19.456 --> 01:13:20.164
Very funny.

1181
01:13:22.667 --> 01:13:25.754
Well, look at you.
You even look like a writer.

1182
01:13:26.797 --> 01:13:28.339
A writer in Paris.

1183
01:13:30.133 --> 01:13:31.718
There's a word for this,
isn't there?

1184
01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:33.762
Uh, butch.

1185
01:13:33.804 --> 01:13:35.054
I was gonna say <i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white"> gamine.</i>

1186
01:13:36.139 --> 01:13:37.515
What do you look like?

1187
01:13:37.557 --> 01:13:39.142
Me? A screwed-up divorcé.

1188
01:13:42.270 --> 01:13:45.982
So my apartment's not far.
Shall we?

1189
01:13:46.023 --> 01:13:48.401
How long are you staying for?

1190
01:13:48.443 --> 01:13:50.862
I suppose it's up to you,
really. It's just...

1191
01:13:52.363 --> 01:13:54.240
Look, I just
wanted to say something

1192
01:13:54.282 --> 01:13:56.326
which I couldn't
really do over the phone.

1193
01:13:56.367 --> 01:13:58.369
Well, ever since we were
last together in London...

1194
01:13:58.411 --> 01:14:00.997
Dexter, before you say
anything else, I have to...

1195
01:14:03.374 --> 01:14:05.710
There's something
I have to tell you.

1196
01:14:07.879 --> 01:14:09.422
You've met someone!

1197
01:14:09.464 --> 01:14:11.341
Is that really
so hard to believe?

1198
01:14:11.382 --> 01:14:13.343
A man? Yes, a man. A guy.

1199
01:14:13.384 --> 01:14:16.346
A guy! He's a guy now,
is he? I see.

1200
01:14:16.387 --> 01:14:18.765
He's called Jean-Pierre,
Jean-Pierre Dusollier.

1201
01:14:18.807 --> 01:14:20.057
What, he's French?

1202
01:14:20.099 --> 01:14:21.976
No, Dex, he's Welsh.

1203
01:14:22.018 --> 01:14:26.815
He's handsome. He's charming.
He's just very, very French.

1204
01:14:26.857 --> 01:14:28.775
What, you mean rude?

1205
01:14:28.817 --> 01:14:30.652
No. Arrogant?

1206
01:14:30.694 --> 01:14:32.403
Smokes too much,
wears a string of onions.

1207
01:14:32.445 --> 01:14:35.281
Why are you being like this?

1208
01:14:35.323 --> 01:14:37.784
Oh, God, you mean sexy. Is that what
you mean? You're having lots of sex?

1209
01:14:37.826 --> 01:14:39.494
Since when do I need
to ask your permission?

1210
01:14:39.536 --> 01:14:40.411
God knows you never asked mine.

1211
01:14:41.245 --> 01:14:43.080
But we just slept together.

1212
01:14:47.084 --> 01:14:48.252
I haven't forgotten.

1213
01:14:54.217 --> 01:14:56.386
Dexter, we got a bit drunk.

1214
01:14:56.427 --> 01:14:58.388
Yeah, not that drunk.

1215
01:14:58.429 --> 01:15:00.014
You took your trousers off
over your shoes.

1216
01:15:00.056 --> 01:15:01.265
No, I didn't.

1217
01:15:02.934 --> 01:15:04.644
Did I?

1218
01:15:04.686 --> 01:15:08.231
I think that you were upset
about Sylvie and the divorce,

1219
01:15:08.272 --> 01:15:10.400
and you needed
a shoulder to cry on.

1220
01:15:10.441 --> 01:15:12.443
Or sleep with.

1221
01:15:12.485 --> 01:15:16.406
And that's what I was,
a shoulder to sleep with.

1222
01:15:16.447 --> 01:15:18.533
And that's why you did
it, was it? To cheer me up.

1223
01:15:18.575 --> 01:15:19.325
Well, it worked, didn't it?

1224
01:15:28.084 --> 01:15:31.087
If you must know, it was one
of the better nights of my life.

1225
01:15:31.128 --> 01:15:32.171
See?

1226
01:15:34.465 --> 01:15:35.759
Don't fish.

1227
01:15:37.594 --> 01:15:39.262
Dex, it was one time.

1228
01:15:41.305 --> 01:15:42.974
Well, it was three times.

1229
01:15:46.561 --> 01:15:49.522
Come on. Look, you
don't think it's a good idea?

1230
01:15:49.564 --> 01:15:50.982
You and me.

1231
01:15:53.526 --> 01:15:55.653
I do. I did.

1232
01:15:55.695 --> 01:15:56.571
In the late '80s. Right.

1233
01:16:02.285 --> 01:16:03.787
Better get going.

1234
01:16:03.828 --> 01:16:05.246
Why? What are we doing?

1235
01:16:05.288 --> 01:16:06.581
Jean-Pierre wants to meet you.

1236
01:16:06.623 --> 01:16:08.124
Oh, you're kidding.

1237
01:16:08.165 --> 01:16:09.793
We're going to hear him play.

1238
01:16:09.834 --> 01:16:11.168
Play?

1239
01:16:11.210 --> 01:16:11.836
He's a jazz musician.

1240
01:16:13.922 --> 01:16:16.382
Bastard.

1241
01:16:16.424 --> 01:16:18.551
We're going to listen to him play free
jazz on the piano for about nine hours,

1242
01:16:18.593 --> 01:16:20.511
and it's going to be lots of
fun and in no way awkward.

1243
01:16:47.664 --> 01:16:49.749
You're not going out
like that, are you?

1244
01:16:51.375 --> 01:16:52.543
Just do me up.

1245
01:16:57.340 --> 01:16:58.716
That's Jean-Pierre.

1246
01:16:58.758 --> 01:16:59.759
Where?

1247
01:17:01.970 --> 01:17:04.806
Oh, God. You could have at least
found someone a bit good-looking.

1248
01:17:08.852 --> 01:17:12.939
You know, Em, I'm sure
he's a fine jazz pianist.

1249
01:17:12.981 --> 01:17:14.482
I just don't think
I can do this.

1250
01:17:15.692 --> 01:17:17.652
Oh. Really?

1251
01:17:17.694 --> 01:17:22.239
Yeah, I'll just go and see a movie
and go back to the apartment.

1252
01:17:22.281 --> 01:17:25.409
And then I think I'm going to
get the first train back tomorrow.

1253
01:17:25.451 --> 01:17:26.619
You don't have to leave.

1254
01:17:26.661 --> 01:17:27.704
I think I do.

1255
01:17:34.168 --> 01:17:36.170
I'm sorry, Dex.

1256
01:17:36.212 --> 01:17:38.214
Hey, don't be.

1257
01:17:44.721 --> 01:17:45.805
Go on.

1258
01:17:58.902 --> 01:18:00.444
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">Salut.</i> Hey.

1259
01:19:03.133 --> 01:19:05.093
Wait! Dexter!

1260
01:19:12.475 --> 01:19:14.144
I thought I got rid of you.

1261
01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:29.867
If you muck me about, Dexter...

1262
01:19:29.909 --> 01:19:31.953
Em, I swear. I swear I won't.

1263
01:19:31.995 --> 01:19:33.871
Lead me on, or let me down,
or go behind my back,

1264
01:19:33.913 --> 01:19:35.123
I will murder you.

1265
01:19:35.165 --> 01:19:35.832
I won't do that.

1266
01:19:37.208 --> 01:19:38.334
You swear?

1267
01:19:41.004 --> 01:19:44.132
Yeah, I swear. I swear.

1268
01:20:06.445 --> 01:20:08.906
I would like to thank everyone
for coming to our wedding.

1269
01:20:08.948 --> 01:20:12.785
For what can only be described
as a whirlwind romance.

1270
01:20:12.827 --> 01:20:13.911
Pause for laughter.

1271
01:20:17.289 --> 01:20:22.628
Seriously, when people ask
how Emma and I first met,

1272
01:20:22.670 --> 01:20:25.965
I tell them that
we grew up together.

1273
01:20:26.007 --> 01:20:28.342
Blah, blah, blah.
Blah, blah, blah.

1274
01:20:28.384 --> 01:20:29.844
You're not going to say, "Blah,
blah, blah," on the day, are you?

1275
01:20:29.886 --> 01:20:30.928
You are not supposed
to be hearing this.

1276
01:20:30.970 --> 01:20:32.138
What if I have notes?

1277
01:20:32.180 --> 01:20:33.389
Come on, let me see.

1278
01:20:33.430 --> 01:20:35.349
No, no.

1279
01:20:35.391 --> 01:20:37.518
When we're married, you're
going to have to obey me.

1280
01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:39.436
Yeah, I'm sure
that's going to happen.

1281
01:20:40.897 --> 01:20:44.525
What? Not again?

1282
01:20:44.567 --> 01:20:46.027
You don't mind, do you?

1283
01:20:46.069 --> 01:20:46.986
No, I don't mind.

1284
01:20:49.613 --> 01:20:51.991
Although, there are
health and safety issues.

1285
01:20:53.201 --> 01:20:54.911
I could lose my license.

1286
01:21:10.634 --> 01:21:12.636
They'll wonder
where we've got to.

1287
01:21:19.936 --> 01:21:21.395
Mmm! Mmm.

1288
01:21:21.437 --> 01:21:24.190
I can definitely smell burning.

1289
01:21:28.027 --> 01:21:29.237
Hello, hello.

1290
01:21:29.279 --> 01:21:30.613
Hi, there.

1291
01:21:30.654 --> 01:21:33.574
Come here, you. Here we go.

1292
01:21:33.616 --> 01:21:36.077
Do you want to give me a
big kiss? Give me a big kiss.

1293
01:21:36.119 --> 01:21:38.329
Go on.

1294
01:21:38.370 --> 01:21:41.207
TV between 5:30 and 6:00,
but no more.

1295
01:21:41.249 --> 01:21:43.209
And she has to
be in bed by 7:30.

1296
01:21:43.251 --> 01:21:44.877
All right,
do you want to run inside?

1297
01:21:44.919 --> 01:21:46.587
Go see Emma. Good girl.

1298
01:21:46.629 --> 01:21:48.214
I'm out here, Jasmine.

1299
01:21:48.256 --> 01:21:50.424
She's loving coming
here at the moment.

1300
01:21:50.466 --> 01:21:51.675
Well, good. That's great.

1301
01:21:51.717 --> 01:21:54.720
I'm really pleased for you.

1302
01:21:54.762 --> 01:21:56.430
Look, I'd invite you in.
It's just...

1303
01:21:56.472 --> 01:21:59.433
No, it's fine. We've got
to go and see my family.

1304
01:21:59.475 --> 01:22:00.684
Have fun. Thanks.

1305
01:22:04.563 --> 01:22:06.065
In you get, Moriarty.

1306
01:22:15.325 --> 01:22:17.034
Dexter? Yeah.

1307
01:22:17.076 --> 01:22:18.577
I've been thinking.

1308
01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:22.290
So have I.

1309
01:22:31.674 --> 01:22:34.385
I want a child
with the man I love.

1310
01:22:37.596 --> 01:22:39.974
And if he won't do it,
then I want one with you.

1311
01:22:46.522 --> 01:22:48.691
Well, then,
we'd better get started.

1312
01:23:33.152 --> 01:23:35.321
I look so tired.

1313
01:23:35.363 --> 01:23:37.740
So take some exercise.
Come swimming with me later.

1314
01:23:37.781 --> 01:23:40.701
No, no, I can't. I've got
to do too much at the cafe.

1315
01:23:40.743 --> 01:23:42.286
Fine. Don't.

1316
01:23:44.580 --> 01:23:46.957
By the way, in case you're
interested, I'm not pregnant.

1317
01:23:50.627 --> 01:23:52.338
Em, how do you know?

1318
01:23:52.380 --> 01:23:53.714
How do you think?

1319
01:23:53.756 --> 01:23:55.007
We could try again, though.

1320
01:23:56.967 --> 01:23:59.553
Come on, look...
No, no, no, no. Come on.

1321
01:24:02.056 --> 01:24:04.308
Look, I'm sorry. All right?

1322
01:24:07.103 --> 01:24:08.979
No, I am
for taking it out on you.

1323
01:24:12.316 --> 01:24:14.110
We're not at our best today,
are we?

1324
01:24:16.279 --> 01:24:21.367
Listen, why don't we
meet each other after work?

1325
01:24:21.409 --> 01:24:24.495
We'll go to the movies.
Your choice.

1326
01:24:24.536 --> 01:24:26.289
Something with subtitles.

1327
01:24:26.330 --> 01:24:27.498
Ooh.

1328
01:24:29.333 --> 01:24:31.752
And we can go and have
some dinner. Just you and me,

1329
01:24:31.794 --> 01:24:35.756
and we can work this out.
All right?

1330
01:24:35.798 --> 01:24:36.882
I promise. Mmm-hmm.

1331
01:24:36.924 --> 01:24:38.259
Yeah.

1332
01:24:38.301 --> 01:24:39.343
Okay.

1333
01:25:23.513 --> 01:25:25.055
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

1334
01:25:30.186 --> 01:25:34.648
Hey, there. Just to say I'm
running late, but I'm on my way.

1335
01:25:34.690 --> 01:25:36.942
I'm sorry for being
so snappy this morning.

<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">I love you very much.</i>

1340
01:26:44.134 --> 01:26:46.262
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">Okay, there you go. Lucky you!</i>

1341
01:28:30.449 --> 01:28:31.367
Dad.

1342
01:28:37.289 --> 01:28:38.332
Dexter? Hello, darling.

1343
01:28:40.292 --> 01:28:41.544
Jasmine!

1344
01:28:45.381 --> 01:28:47.924
Are you all right?
Go and get dressed.

1345
01:28:49.468 --> 01:28:51.220
Sylvie, Sylvie. Dexter?

1346
01:28:51.261 --> 01:28:54.223
Sylvie, Sylvie, I screwed up.

1347
01:28:54.264 --> 01:28:55.516
Jasmine, now!

1348
01:28:55.558 --> 01:28:57.476
I screwed up.

1349
01:28:57.518 --> 01:28:58.935
It's all right.
You're all right.

1350
01:28:58.977 --> 01:29:01.021
No, I screwed up.

1351
01:29:01.063 --> 01:29:02.272
Come on, let's get you up.
Come on.

1352
01:29:07.903 --> 01:29:09.697
I'm so sorry.

1353
01:29:09.739 --> 01:29:10.947
It's all right.

1354
01:29:10.989 --> 01:29:12.157
Aw, Dex, come on.

1355
01:29:14.702 --> 01:29:16.746
You poor thing.

1356
01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:23.627
Oh, God. Dexter.

1357
01:30:06.378 --> 01:30:10.299
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">As the rain c<font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">ame down,
the water l<font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">evels began to rise.</i>

1358
01:30:10.340 --> 01:30:15.929
So is this going to be an
annual festival, do you think?

1359
01:30:15.971 --> 01:30:18.014
Every year, 15th of July?

1360
01:30:19.850 --> 01:30:22.728
Well, I hope not.

1361
01:30:22.770 --> 01:30:24.605
I don't want a heart-to-heart.

1362
01:30:27.357 --> 01:30:28.525
Do you?

1363
01:30:28.567 --> 01:30:31.779
No, no. I'd rather not.

1364
01:30:31.821 --> 01:30:34.782
Except to say, that I think
the best thing that you could do

1365
01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:40.996
would be to try to live your
life as if Emma was still here.

1366
01:30:43.915 --> 01:30:45.041
Don't you?

1367
01:30:51.590 --> 01:30:52.633
I don't know if I can.

1368
01:30:52.675 --> 01:30:53.801
Of course you can.

1369
01:30:58.305 --> 01:31:01.266
What do you think I've been
doing for the past 10 years?

1370
01:31:10.066 --> 01:31:14.822
Now <i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white"> Silent Witness</i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white"> is on. 9:00.

1371
01:31:20.202 --> 01:31:21.411
Right.

1372
01:31:34.090 --> 01:31:35.384
Ian. God!

1373
01:31:35.425 --> 01:31:36.677
Dexter.

1374
01:31:36.719 --> 01:31:38.637
Hi. Hello, mate.

1375
01:31:38.679 --> 01:31:40.514
Are you well?
Yeah, look at this.

1376
01:31:42.307 --> 01:31:44.643
So, how are you?
How's the stand-up comedy?

1377
01:31:44.685 --> 01:31:46.395
Oh, well,
I gave that up, actually.

1378
01:31:46.436 --> 01:31:47.813
That's a shame.

1379
01:31:47.855 --> 01:31:51.316
No, not really,
because I was never any good.

1380
01:31:51.358 --> 01:31:53.527
The only time
I ever made Emma laugh

1381
01:31:53.569 --> 01:31:55.278
was when I fell down
the stairs. Really.

1382
01:31:57.072 --> 01:31:59.115
No, I'm in insurance now.

1383
01:31:59.157 --> 01:32:00.784
Great, great.

1384
01:32:05.748 --> 01:32:08.542
I hate today. Fifteenth of July.

1385
01:32:11.127 --> 01:32:12.796
Saint Swithin's Day.

1386
01:32:14.256 --> 01:32:16.508
It's a tough one.

1387
01:32:16.550 --> 01:32:21.513
I never noticed it before, but it
was always there just waiting, lurking.

1388
01:32:23.599 --> 01:32:26.059
I used to hate you, too.

1389
01:32:26.101 --> 01:32:29.104
Quite violently, actually,
Dexter. No, I'm sorry, but...

1390
01:32:29.145 --> 01:32:33.776
Because, she lit up with you.

1391
01:32:36.612 --> 01:32:39.865
Just in a way that
she never would with me,

1392
01:32:39.907 --> 01:32:43.953
and it used to make me
so angry because...

1393
01:32:43.994 --> 01:32:47.664
I didn't think that you
deserved her. Can I say this?

1394
01:32:47.706 --> 01:32:49.583
Yeah, go on.

1395
01:32:49.625 --> 01:32:51.084
She made you decent.

1396
01:32:53.921 --> 01:32:59.009
And then in return,
you made her so happy.

1397
01:32:59.050 --> 01:33:00.302
So happy.

1398
01:33:03.221 --> 01:33:06.725
And I will always be
grateful to you for that.

1399
01:33:11.229 --> 01:33:16.192
And on that bombshell,
back to the sticks.

1400
01:33:16.234 --> 01:33:17.611
There's my lot out there.
Oh! Look at them.

1401
01:33:17.653 --> 01:33:19.154
Yeah, I know.

1402
01:33:21.865 --> 01:33:25.285
So, listen, we'll stay in
touch. I'll give you a call.

1403
01:33:25.327 --> 01:33:27.871
No, I don't think that's
necessary. I think we're done here.

1404
01:33:29.539 --> 01:33:30.540
Come here.

1405
01:33:32.167 --> 01:33:33.376
Good luck, mate. All right?

1406
01:33:33.418 --> 01:33:34.711
You, too.

1407
01:33:34.753 --> 01:33:35.796
Thank you.

1408
01:33:43.762 --> 01:33:44.554
You've got cake everywhere.

1409
01:33:49.018 --> 01:33:49.852
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white"> Wake up.</i>

1410
01:33:52.354 --> 01:33:53.480
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white">Wake up.</i>

1411
01:33:59.277 --> 01:34:01.655
It's all right.
Don't panic. It's only me.

1412
01:34:03.198 --> 01:34:04.825
Emma. Emma Morley.

1413
01:34:04.867 --> 01:34:06.076
Yes. Hello.

1414
01:34:07.285 --> 01:34:09.454
So what do you suggest we do?

1415
01:34:11.498 --> 01:34:14.376
We could stay in touch.

1416
01:34:14.417 --> 01:34:16.628
Today. We're meant
to be doing something today.

1417
01:34:18.588 --> 01:34:20.757
Right. Right, right.

1418
01:34:20.799 --> 01:34:24.636
Look, today's a bit
tricky for me, really.

1419
01:34:24.678 --> 01:34:27.639
No, no, it's not that.
It's just...

1420
01:34:27.681 --> 01:34:29.766
Well, I'm meeting my parents,
and then I've got to get back...

1421
01:34:29.808 --> 01:34:31.685
Oh, yeah, yeah,
you should probably go then.

1422
01:34:35.271 --> 01:34:37.190
It was lovely to meet you.
Bye, now.

1423
01:34:45.032 --> 01:34:49.411
Look, that's not until later,
so if you wanted to,

1424
01:34:51.621 --> 01:34:53.540
we could go for
a walk or something?

1425
01:34:57.502 --> 01:34:58.461
Okay.

1426
01:35:12.308 --> 01:35:14.937
Come on, keep up.

1427
01:35:14.978 --> 01:35:19.149
It's these shoes. I can't
mountain climb in brogues.

1428
01:35:19.190 --> 01:35:22.485
It's not K2. It's just a big hill,
all right? A child could do it.

1429
01:35:28.450 --> 01:35:32.412
I don't want you thinking I'm
bothered or anything about last night.

1430
01:35:32.454 --> 01:35:35.958
I don't want your phone
number, or letters, or postcards.

1431
01:35:35.999 --> 01:35:38.043
I don't want to
get married to you.

1432
01:35:38.085 --> 01:35:40.420
Definitely don't want
to have your babies.

1433
01:35:40.462 --> 01:35:42.672
Whatever happens tomorrow,
we've had today.

1434
01:35:49.471 --> 01:35:51.848
And if we should bump into
each other sometime in the future,

1435
01:35:51.890 --> 01:35:53.475
well, that's fine, too.

1436
01:35:55.018 --> 01:35:56.979
We'll be friends.

1437
01:35:57.020 --> 01:35:58.563
Yeah, right.

1438
01:36:05.570 --> 01:36:07.990
Or, you know,
on the other hand...

1439
01:36:10.617 --> 01:36:11.701
Go on.

1440
01:36:14.245 --> 01:36:16.372
Well, my parents
don't arrive until later.

1441
01:36:18.333 --> 01:36:20.085
So?

1442
01:36:20.127 --> 01:36:22.754
So, well, the flat's empty.

1443
01:36:25.048 --> 01:36:27.717
You know, if you wanted
to finish what we started.

1444
01:36:29.594 --> 01:36:30.971
What? Sober?

1445
01:36:31.596 --> 01:36:32.555
Mmm-hmm.

1446
01:36:34.141 --> 01:36:35.391
And in daylight.

1447
01:36:39.980 --> 01:36:40.814
Race you!

1448
01:36:56.746 --> 01:37:00.250
Do you want a piggy-back,
you old man?

1449
01:37:00.291 --> 01:37:03.712
It's these shoes. There's no
blooming grip on these things.

1450
01:37:03.753 --> 01:37:05.421
Here, come here, you.

1451
01:37:10.260 --> 01:37:11.178
Did you come up here with Emma?

1452
01:37:11.220 --> 01:37:12.929
Yeah, once.

1453
01:37:12.971 --> 01:37:14.472
That was a long time ago now.

1454
01:37:15.891 --> 01:37:17.433
Do you miss her?

1455
01:37:17.475 --> 01:37:18.560
Well, of course, I do.

1456
01:37:20.187 --> 01:37:23.857
She was...
She was my best friend.

1457
01:37:23.899 --> 01:37:26.151
Who's your best friend now then?

1458
01:37:26.193 --> 01:37:28.486
Well, you are, of course.
Come here.

1459
01:37:30.030 --> 01:37:31.364
Why, who's yours?

1460
01:37:32.991 --> 01:37:34.993
I think it's probably Mum.

1461
01:37:38.997 --> 01:37:39.873
Yeah.

1462
01:37:42.625 --> 01:37:44.377
I'm not so
terrible though, am I?

1463
01:37:44.419 --> 01:37:45.879
I'm not answering that.

1464
01:37:50.633 --> 01:37:52.219
You know what you are.

1465
01:38:19.121 --> 01:38:21.164
It's just round the corner.
This way.

1466
01:38:22.624 --> 01:38:23.792
Oh, Dexter!

1467
01:38:23.833 --> 01:38:25.294
Damn it, they're early.

1468
01:38:27.837 --> 01:38:29.214
You're early.

1469
01:38:29.256 --> 01:38:31.466
We thought we'd surprise you.

1470
01:38:31.507 --> 01:38:32.842
Clearly, we have.

1471
01:38:35.511 --> 01:38:38.014
Mum, Dad, this is Emma Morley.
Morley.

1472
01:38:38.056 --> 01:38:39.515
Hello. Pleased to meet you.

1473
01:38:39.557 --> 01:38:41.643
Emma, you'll join us
for tea, yes?

1474
01:38:41.684 --> 01:38:44.813
No, no, thanks.
I should leave you to it.

1475
01:38:44.854 --> 01:38:47.440
Are you going to go? Yeah. Well,

1476
01:38:47.482 --> 01:38:49.901
pleasure to meet you and...

1477
01:38:49.943 --> 01:38:52.279
Well, have a nice life.

1478
01:38:52.321 --> 01:38:53.280
Okay.

1479
01:39:00.078 --> 01:39:02.705
I'm sorry. Did we
just interrupt something?

1480
01:39:02.747 --> 01:39:06.084
No, no.
Emma's just a good friend.

1481
01:39:07.877 --> 01:39:08.878
Weren't you
wearing this yesterday?

1482
01:39:09.879 --> 01:39:10.880
The rascal.

1483
01:39:16.886 --> 01:39:18.638
Emma! Em!

1484
01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:21.099
Em, wait! Wait, wait.

1485
01:39:23.185 --> 01:39:26.313
Look, I need your phone number.

1486
01:39:26.355 --> 01:39:29.899
My number? Right. Of course.

1487
01:39:29.941 --> 01:39:31.734
Look, I'm so sorry
about all of that.

1488
01:39:31.776 --> 01:39:34.404
I wasn't expecting them until
after we... Well, you know.

1489
01:39:35.905 --> 01:39:36.906
Right.

1490
01:39:38.241 --> 01:39:39.326
This is me in Edinburgh.

1491
01:39:39.368 --> 01:39:40.493
Right.

1492
01:39:41.703 --> 01:39:43.163
My parents' number

1493
01:39:44.789 --> 01:39:46.666
and their address just in case.

1494
01:39:46.708 --> 01:39:48.960
Right.

1495
01:39:49.002 --> 01:39:50.753
Oh. Dad's got
a fax machine at work.

1496
01:39:50.795 --> 01:39:53.298
Just the phone number's fine.

1497
01:39:53.340 --> 01:39:54.383
Thank you.

1498
01:40:25.830 --> 01:40:26.831
Look, I've got to go.

1499
01:40:26.873 --> 01:40:27.749
I know.

1500
01:40:31.086 --> 01:40:32.379
But we will see
each other again.

1501
01:40:32.421 --> 01:40:33.629
I know we will.

1502
01:40:36.425 --> 01:40:37.426
Goodbye, Dex.

1503
01:40:38.009 --> 01:40:39.052
Goodbye.

1504
01:40:40.511 --> 01:40:41.554
Goodbye.
