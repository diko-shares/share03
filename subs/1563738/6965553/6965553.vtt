WEBVTT

1
00:03:13.152 --> 00:03:14.361
Bye, guys.

2
00:03:14.445 --> 00:03:15.738
It's three years.

3
00:03:15.863 --> 00:03:17.198
Three years
together.

4
00:03:17.281 --> 00:03:18.449
The lads.

5
00:03:18.574 --> 00:03:19.742
Me and you?

6
00:03:19.825 --> 00:03:22.161
We'll see
each other again.
Really?

7
00:03:22.244 --> 00:03:23.412
They're not going,
are they?

8
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.916
Group hug!

9
00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:29.710
See you, ladies!
See you later.

10
00:03:31.921 --> 00:03:33.505
Group hug.

11
00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:35.549
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!

12
00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:37.635
Tilly?

13
00:03:37.968 --> 00:03:39.011
Callum!

14
00:03:39.094 --> 00:03:40.930
Tilly, come on.
It's time to go home.

15
00:03:41.013 --> 00:03:42.973
Come on.
Callum!

16
00:03:43.766 --> 00:03:45.351
Ow!

17
00:03:51.148 --> 00:03:53.317
You know,
we've never actually met.

18
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.669
Actually, we have.
Several times.

19
00:03:54.693 --> 00:03:55.694
Have we?

20
00:03:55.778 --> 00:03:58.614
You gatecrashed
my birthday party,
called me Julie,

21
00:03:58.697 --> 00:04:00.074
and spilled red wine
down my top.

22
00:04:00.157 --> 00:04:01.242
Ouch.

23
00:04:02.034 --> 00:04:03.369
Well, I'm sorry
about that.

24
00:04:03.452 --> 00:04:04.495
No, not at all.

25
00:04:04.578 --> 00:04:05.579
You were delightful.

26
00:04:05.663 --> 00:04:06.663
Was I?

27
00:04:06.705 --> 00:04:08.374
No. No, you weren't.

28
00:04:08.457 --> 00:04:10.584
Look, if you're
not Julie, then...

29
00:04:10.668 --> 00:04:11.835
I'm Emma.
Emma.

30
00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:14.046
Emma Morley.
Emma Morley.

31
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.548
Listen, I'll walk you home.

32
00:04:19.802 --> 00:04:20.886
So this is me.

33
00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.304
Shh!
Welcome home.

34
00:04:22.388 --> 00:04:25.057
So debate is fine,
but anyone can talk...

35
00:04:29.395 --> 00:04:31.897
Just sometimes,
action's what's needed.

36
00:04:31.981 --> 00:04:35.276
To change the world.
I completely agree.

37
00:04:36.235 --> 00:04:39.822
So what are you gonna be
when you're,
I don't know, 40?

38
00:04:39.905 --> 00:04:40.906
Forty?

39
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.993
Can I say famous?
Horribly rich?

40
00:04:44.076 --> 00:04:46.704
Terrible.
You're so terribly posh.

41
00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:48.497
Where are you going?

42
00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.599
I'm just gonna
go brush my teeth.

43
00:04:49.623 --> 00:04:51.041
You know,
booze and fags and...

44
00:04:51.125 --> 00:04:52.126
I don't mind.

45
00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:53.252
I do.

46
00:04:53.794 --> 00:04:55.963
Listen, won't be a minute.

47
00:04:57.298 --> 00:04:58.882
No playing with yourself
while I'm gone.

48
00:05:01.552 --> 00:05:02.761
What?

49
00:05:15.024 --> 00:05:17.359
All right, concentrate.

50
00:05:17.443 --> 00:05:21.113
Concentrate.
Do not cock this up!

51
00:05:35.461 --> 00:05:36.712
Oh, you're going?

52
00:05:36.795 --> 00:05:39.715
Well, it's getting light out,
so I thought I could just...

53
00:05:39.798 --> 00:05:41.759
You should go
if you want to go.

54
00:05:41.842 --> 00:05:42.986
It's very poignant.
Very bittersweet.

55
00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.054
Really I just thought
you might wanna
get some sleep.

56
00:05:45.137 --> 00:05:46.180
I don't have to go.

57
00:05:46.263 --> 00:05:47.389
No, no, go.
I'm not bothered.

58
00:05:47.473 --> 00:05:48.891
Sneak off.

59
00:05:48.974 --> 00:05:50.142
I wasn't sneaking off.

60
00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:51.536
Jump out the window
for all I care.

61
00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.020
It's five floors up,
mind.

62
00:05:53.103 --> 00:05:55.147
Look, I'll stay.
All right?

63
00:05:55.856 --> 00:05:57.858
I'll stay.

64
00:05:57.941 --> 00:05:59.318
Come on.

65
00:06:02.863 --> 00:06:05.157
Sorry, I'm no good at this.

66
00:06:06.325 --> 00:06:08.494
It's just whenever
I go to bed with someone,

67
00:06:08.577 --> 00:06:11.872
I always end up
either laughing or weeping,

68
00:06:11.955 --> 00:06:13.933
and it could be nice
to go for something
in between.

69
00:06:13.957 --> 00:06:16.418
Look, that's fine.

70
00:06:16.502 --> 00:06:19.588
That's fine. Maybe we
could just be friends.

71
00:06:20.547 --> 00:06:23.384
Okay. Friends.

72
00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:38.107
Of course, you know it's
Saint Swithin's Day
today, don't you?

73
00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.775
What is?

74
00:06:39.858 --> 00:06:43.821
Well, today.
Saint Swithin's Day,
the 15th of July.

75
00:06:43.904 --> 00:06:45.697
How do you know that?

76
00:06:45.781 --> 00:06:48.534
Well, he was buried in
Winchester Cathedral,

77
00:06:48.617 --> 00:06:50.828
which is where
I went to school.

78
00:06:50.911 --> 00:06:52.329
Well, la-dee-da.

79
00:06:52.454 --> 00:06:53.872
La-dee-da.

80
00:06:55.374 --> 00:06:58.210
You know,
there's a poem.

81
00:06:58.293 --> 00:07:02.005
"If on Saint Swithin's Day,
it doth rain

82
00:07:02.089 --> 00:07:06.427
"something, something,
something remain."

83
00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:08.303
Dexter, that's beautiful.

84
00:07:08.387 --> 00:07:10.139
Shut up.

85
00:07:10.222 --> 00:07:12.599
Let's get some sleep.

86
00:07:19.857 --> 00:07:21.233
But, Dex.

87
00:07:21.358 --> 00:07:22.734
Em?

88
00:07:22.818 --> 00:07:24.570
If it doesn't rain...

89
00:07:24.653 --> 00:07:26.029
Mmm-hmm?

90
00:07:28.073 --> 00:07:30.951
...do you want to
do something?
Me and you?

91
00:07:31.994 --> 00:07:33.203
Mmm-hmm.

92
00:07:36.623 --> 00:07:37.809
- Are you all right?
- Lift, lift.

93
00:07:37.833 --> 00:07:39.918
Okay, well,
I'm coming up.

94
00:07:42.337 --> 00:07:44.673
Couldn't you have
just hired someone
to move this stuff?

95
00:07:44.756 --> 00:07:45.799
No.

96
00:07:46.675 --> 00:07:48.010
Look, I would
have paid.

97
00:07:48.093 --> 00:07:50.304
All right,
lift from your end.

98
00:07:50.387 --> 00:07:52.031
You've obviously
never done a day's work
in your life.

99
00:07:52.055 --> 00:07:55.642
Look, seriously, Em,
my plane leaves in four hours.

100
00:07:55.726 --> 00:07:58.187
All right,
well, all the more reason
why you should lift.

101
00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:59.771
God's sake.

102
00:08:01.064 --> 00:08:02.125
Look, I'm doing you a favor.

103
00:08:02.149 --> 00:08:04.109
And I am so,
so grateful.

104
00:08:04.193 --> 00:08:05.861
Stop whinging.

105
00:08:07.863 --> 00:08:09.698
I bet this bed
could tell some stories.

106
00:08:09.781 --> 00:08:12.993
Yeah, short stories.
Horror stories.

107
00:08:13.076 --> 00:08:15.913
Welcome to London.
Well, lift it.

108
00:08:20.292 --> 00:08:22.377
I think I'm gonna
be very happy here.

109
00:08:22.461 --> 00:08:23.795
What is that smell?

110
00:08:23.962 --> 00:08:25.297
Onions.

111
00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:26.965
Onions and disappointment.

112
00:08:27.466 --> 00:08:28.675
Right.

113
00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.052
No, it's not that bad.

114
00:08:30.135 --> 00:08:32.346
It's nothing
that a lick of paint

115
00:08:32.471 --> 00:08:34.681
and a nuclear warhead
can't fix.

116
00:08:34.765 --> 00:08:38.227
I've got my typewriter.
I've got my books.
I'm in London.

117
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:39.621
I think it's
going to be all right.

118
00:08:39.645 --> 00:08:40.925
I might actually
get things done.

119
00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:42.856
You know, you might
actually meet someone.

120
00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:43.941
Dexter, please.

121
00:08:44.066 --> 00:08:45.067
A nice guy.

122
00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.652
Sensitive, wears a cardigan.

123
00:08:46.777 --> 00:08:48.296
I told you I'm not interested
in any of that.

124
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.405
Matching glasses,
matching opinions.

125
00:08:50.489 --> 00:08:52.008
I'm actually glad
you're going to India.

126
00:08:52.032 --> 00:08:55.369
Good, 'cause I'm leaving.
I've got to catch my flight.

127
00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:57.037
Already?

128
00:08:57.162 --> 00:08:58.789
Yeah, I'm sorry.

129
00:09:00.916 --> 00:09:03.752
Well, go on then.
Find yourself.

130
00:09:03.835 --> 00:09:06.004
Keep sending me
those letters.

131
00:09:06.088 --> 00:09:07.923
Long ones.
I will.

132
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:09.550
And have fun, Em.

133
00:09:09.675 --> 00:09:10.884
Of course.

134
00:09:10.968 --> 00:09:12.511
You know, it is allowed.

135
00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:15.281
You know, I've got a feeling
that this time next year

136
00:09:15.305 --> 00:09:16.848
you're going to
take London by storm.

137
00:09:24.648 --> 00:09:25.983
What is
the difference between...

138
00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:27.418
A tortilla is
either corn or wheat.

139
00:09:27.442 --> 00:09:29.361
But a corn tortilla
folded and filled is a taco,

140
00:09:29.528 --> 00:09:31.446
whereas a filled
wheat tortilla is a burrito.

141
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:33.115
Deep fry a burrito,
it's a chimichanga.

142
00:09:33.198 --> 00:09:36.952
Toast a tortilla,
it's a tostada.
Roll it, it's an enchilada.

143
00:09:39.037 --> 00:09:40.998
Is there any chance
you could repeat that?

144
00:09:43.458 --> 00:09:45.961
Hello. I'm Ian.
Ian Whitehead.

145
00:09:46.044 --> 00:09:47.963
The new boy.

146
00:09:48.046 --> 00:09:49.840
Welcome to
the graveyard of ambition.

147
00:09:51.842 --> 00:09:53.635
The kitchen.
All right, mate.

148
00:09:53.719 --> 00:09:55.846
What these guys
can't do with a microwave

149
00:09:55.929 --> 00:09:57.055
and a deep-fat fryer.

150
00:09:57.139 --> 00:09:58.223
Hey, you!

151
00:09:58.765 --> 00:10:01.059
Your basic
Tex-Mex food groups.

152
00:10:01.143 --> 00:10:02.811
Cheese on top of
chicken under guacamole

153
00:10:02.894 --> 00:10:05.314
on top of beans
under rice on top of beef.

154
00:10:05.439 --> 00:10:08.984
Word of warning,
avoid the jumbo prawns.

155
00:10:09.067 --> 00:10:11.862
It's like Russian Roulette.
One in six will kill you.

156
00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:13.030
So what's your stroke?

157
00:10:13.447 --> 00:10:14.823
Sorry, my what?

158
00:10:14.906 --> 00:10:18.243
Waiter/actor,
waiter/model, waiter/writer?

159
00:10:18.327 --> 00:10:19.911
Well, I'm a comedian.

160
00:10:20.454 --> 00:10:24.124
We could use a comedian.
We all like to laugh.
I know I used to.

161
00:10:24.207 --> 00:10:25.667
Well, I'm just
starting out really.

162
00:10:25.751 --> 00:10:28.128
Working on my
"unique comedy stylings."

163
00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:32.090
Not jokes so much,
more sort of wry,
little observations.

164
00:10:32.591 --> 00:10:34.051
<i>Ay caramba!</i>

165
00:10:34.301 --> 00:10:35.695
I've got this whole bit
at the moment

166
00:10:35.719 --> 00:10:37.888
about the difference
between men and women.

167
00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:41.058
How blokes, when they
see a girl they fancy,
they get all...

168
00:10:41.141 --> 00:10:43.560
Toilets. Staff toilets.
Oh.

169
00:10:43.644 --> 00:10:44.936
Sorry. You were saying?

170
00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:48.190
No, no.
I'm doing an open mic tonight
if you were interested.

171
00:10:48.273 --> 00:10:51.943
At The House of Laffs,
spelled L-A-F-F-S.

172
00:10:52.027 --> 00:10:53.153
It's not a date or anything.

173
00:10:53.236 --> 00:10:55.238
You've probably
got a boyfriend anyway,
have you?

174
00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:00.077
Ian, I'd love to come,
but after work,

175
00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.788
I like to head home,
comfort eat, weep.

176
00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:07.376
So what about you, Emma?
What's your stroke?

177
00:11:07.459 --> 00:11:09.378
What do you really do?

178
00:11:09.461 --> 00:11:12.464
Uh, this. This is what I do.

179
00:11:13.131 --> 00:11:15.634
Still, it's not forever,
is it?

180
00:11:20.097 --> 00:11:23.892
My room still smells.
Tilly's sending me mad.
The flat's a dump.

181
00:11:23.975 --> 00:11:25.936
I keep finding
teeth marks in the cheese

182
00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:28.230
<i>and her big gray bras
soaking in the sink.</i>

183
00:11:28.313 --> 00:11:30.148
Look, I'm sure it's
not a complete disaster.

184
00:11:31.024 --> 00:11:33.652
London's swallowed me up.

185
00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:38.198
I thought I'd
make a difference,
but no one knows I'm here.

186
00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:40.659
Listen, listen.
Nothing truly good
was ever easy.

187
00:11:40.742 --> 00:11:41.743
<i>Who said that?</i>

188
00:11:42.411 --> 00:11:43.412
<i>You did.</i>

189
00:11:43.495 --> 00:11:44.955
Did I? That's annoying.

190
00:11:45.789 --> 00:11:49.751
I'm sorry for moaning.
I just...
I really wanted to hear...

191
00:11:49.835 --> 00:11:51.586
How's teaching? How's Paris?

192
00:11:52.212 --> 00:11:53.505
It's good, Em.

193
00:11:53.588 --> 00:11:55.966
You know,
truly, really fulfilling.

194
00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:58.093
<i>Well, don't sleep with
any of your students.</i>

195
00:11:58.218 --> 00:12:00.262
<i>It's unethical
and predictable.</i>

196
00:12:00.345 --> 00:12:01.972
It's good advice, Em.
Thank you.

197
00:12:02.764 --> 00:12:04.444
<i>But I've got to go
and have lunch with Mum.</i>

198
00:12:04.516 --> 00:12:07.811
<i>Well,
apologize again, will you?</i>

199
00:12:07.894 --> 00:12:10.188
I didn't mean to
call your dad a fascist.

200
00:12:10.272 --> 00:12:11.773
A bourgeois fascist.

201
00:12:11.857 --> 00:12:14.776
Say sorry and, Dexter...

202
00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:16.069
My money's running out.
Em?

203
00:12:16.153 --> 00:12:18.280
Can you hear me?
Dex? Dex?

204
00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:27.038
I miss you.

205
00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:52.522
Forty-five
minutes late.

206
00:12:52.647 --> 00:12:53.899
Yeah, well, I got waylaid.

207
00:12:53.982 --> 00:12:55.567
And where were you
last night?

208
00:12:55.692 --> 00:12:56.985
Language school disco.

209
00:12:57.068 --> 00:12:59.488
Was it fun?
No, it was hell.

210
00:13:00.572 --> 00:13:03.492
Tell me,
who's been writing you
all those long letters?

211
00:13:03.575 --> 00:13:05.327
That is none of your business.

212
00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:08.163
Was it that girl
who came to stay?

213
00:13:08.246 --> 00:13:10.006
Yeah. Well, Emma and I
are just good friends.

214
00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:15.837
How much holiday
do you need?

215
00:13:15.921 --> 00:13:18.673
I'm not on holiday.
I'm teaching English.

216
00:13:18.757 --> 00:13:19.758
Dexter.

217
00:13:22.511 --> 00:13:24.346
Isn't that Alain Delon?

218
00:13:24.429 --> 00:13:26.723
What?
Oh, no. It's your father.

219
00:13:29.267 --> 00:13:31.645
Picking his corns.
Stop it.

220
00:13:34.147 --> 00:13:36.149
Take me for lunch tomorrow,
will you?

221
00:13:36.233 --> 00:13:39.820
Just you and me.
Somewhere quiet
with white tablecloths.

222
00:13:39.903 --> 00:13:41.947
I want to talk to you.

223
00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:43.114
Why? Is something wrong?

224
00:13:43.198 --> 00:13:45.534
No. Nothing's wrong.

225
00:13:45.617 --> 00:13:46.868
Then why do we
need to talk?

226
00:13:46.952 --> 00:13:48.662
Do I need a reason?

227
00:13:49.246 --> 00:13:51.540
There you are.
Degenerate.

228
00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:59.798
Now, I thought
you might want these.

229
00:14:00.632 --> 00:14:03.176
Oh, thank you,
my love.

230
00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:08.640
So what's for supper?
Please, God,
not French food.

231
00:14:23.488 --> 00:14:25.907
Golden Boy wants
to see you.
Hmm?

232
00:14:25.991 --> 00:14:27.993
He's got a new one.

233
00:14:33.915 --> 00:14:35.709
Good night.
Good night.

234
00:14:35.792 --> 00:14:37.002
Night.
Good night.

235
00:14:38.044 --> 00:14:39.087
Have a good one.

236
00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:40.171
We were just kissing.

237
00:14:40.255 --> 00:14:43.800
You were trying to
fit her entire head
in your mouth.

238
00:14:43.884 --> 00:14:46.928
People have enough trouble
keeping the food down
as it is.

239
00:14:47.012 --> 00:14:48.889
And what does she
see in you, anyway?

240
00:14:48.972 --> 00:14:51.099
Well, she says
I'm complicated.

241
00:14:52.559 --> 00:14:53.977
You're just spoiled.

242
00:14:57.564 --> 00:15:00.191
I got offered
the job of manager today.

243
00:15:00.275 --> 00:15:02.777
They told me
they wanted someone
who wasn't going anywhere.

244
00:15:02.861 --> 00:15:05.906
All right, Em, listen.
I think you should
take a bottle of tequila,

245
00:15:05.989 --> 00:15:07.449
I think you should
walk out the door,

246
00:15:07.574 --> 00:15:09.135
and I don't think you
need to ever come back.

247
00:15:09.159 --> 00:15:10.702
But my job is my life.

248
00:15:10.785 --> 00:15:13.830
You can't throw away
years of your life
just because,

249
00:15:13.914 --> 00:15:15.874
well, you think
it's funny.

250
00:15:15.957 --> 00:15:19.210
My hair smells of cheese.
Monterey Jack.

251
00:15:20.086 --> 00:15:22.213
Look, I thought you
were writing poetry.

252
00:15:22.297 --> 00:15:25.383
What, go where the money is?
Tried that. Failed.

253
00:15:25.717 --> 00:15:27.302
You just can't
see it, can you?

254
00:15:27.385 --> 00:15:30.221
Look, you're funny.
You're attractive.
You're smart.

255
00:15:30.305 --> 00:15:32.307
I mean, you're
the smartest person I know.

256
00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:34.684
Sure.
You are. You're attractive.

257
00:15:34.768 --> 00:15:36.353
You're sexy.
What?

258
00:15:36.436 --> 00:15:38.480
What? Is that supposed to be
sexist or something?

259
00:15:38.563 --> 00:15:42.275
No, it's not sexist.
It's just ridiculous.

260
00:15:42.359 --> 00:15:43.902
Em, listen.

261
00:15:46.488 --> 00:15:48.531
If I could just give
you one gift, all right,

262
00:15:48.657 --> 00:15:50.659
one gift for
the rest of your life,

263
00:15:50.742 --> 00:15:53.536
do you know
what I'd give you?

264
00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:54.913
Confidence.

265
00:15:55.747 --> 00:15:58.083
It's either that
or a scented candle.

266
00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:00.585
Come here.

267
00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:06.883
Emma? So I've disinfected
the meat fridge.

268
00:16:06.967 --> 00:16:08.677
My hero.

269
00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:11.346
Thank you, Ian.
See you tomorrow.

270
00:16:11.429 --> 00:16:12.847
Bye, mate.

271
00:16:14.641 --> 00:16:16.977
Bye, Emma.

272
00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.853
I should go, too.
All right.

273
00:16:18.937 --> 00:16:22.440
I'll be fine. I just
feel a bit lost, that's all.

274
00:16:22.524 --> 00:16:24.818
Come on,
everyone's lost at 25.

275
00:16:24.901 --> 00:16:26.403
You're not.

276
00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:30.532
Trainee TV producer.
Nice new flat. CD player.

277
00:16:30.615 --> 00:16:32.450
Group sex
Tuesdays and Fridays.

278
00:16:32.534 --> 00:16:35.704
Yeah, but you know,
I am crying on the inside.

279
00:16:41.876 --> 00:16:43.196
You know what you need,
don't you?

280
00:16:43.253 --> 00:16:44.587
Mmm-mmm.

281
00:16:44.796 --> 00:16:46.798
You need a holiday.

282
00:16:47.966 --> 00:16:50.719
Look, Dexter,
all I'm saying is
I think we need some rules.

283
00:16:50.802 --> 00:16:52.387
Rules!

284
00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:54.848
I'm not taking any chances
with our friendship,
all right.

285
00:16:54.973 --> 00:16:56.725
All right, all right.
Such as?

286
00:16:56.808 --> 00:16:57.976
Separate bedrooms.

287
00:16:58.059 --> 00:17:00.645
Wherever we stay,
no shared beds,
no drunken cuddles.

288
00:17:00.729 --> 00:17:02.772
I don't see the point
of cuddling, anyway.

289
00:17:02.856 --> 00:17:03.982
Cuddling gives you cramp.

290
00:17:04.065 --> 00:17:05.108
Agreed, then.

291
00:17:06.192 --> 00:17:08.945
Rule number two.
No flirting.

292
00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:11.281
No having a few drinks
and getting frisky with me.

293
00:17:11.364 --> 00:17:12.365
Or anyone else.

294
00:17:12.449 --> 00:17:13.449
Well, I never flirt.

295
00:17:13.491 --> 00:17:14.993
I'm serious.

296
00:17:15.118 --> 00:17:16.578
Hello, what's this?

297
00:17:27.088 --> 00:17:29.049
Which leads me
to rule three.

298
00:17:29.132 --> 00:17:31.217
The nudity clause.
What?

299
00:17:31.301 --> 00:17:33.470
I don't want to see you
in the shower,
or have a wee.

300
00:17:33.553 --> 00:17:35.055
Or have a wee in the shower.

301
00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:36.389
Well, I can't promise that.

302
00:17:36.473 --> 00:17:37.974
You have to, Dex.
It's the rules,

303
00:17:38.058 --> 00:17:41.728
and absolutely
no skinny-dipping.

304
00:17:43.521 --> 00:17:45.774
All right, then.
Rule number four.
What?

305
00:17:45.857 --> 00:17:47.609
No Scrabble.
I love Scrabble.

306
00:17:47.692 --> 00:17:50.528
That is exactly
why it's my rule.

307
00:17:50.612 --> 00:17:51.863
Look, we're not dead yet.

308
00:17:56.826 --> 00:17:58.119
<i>Voilà.</i>

309
00:18:10.548 --> 00:18:11.800
What is that?

310
00:18:11.883 --> 00:18:15.261
Hmm? My swimming costume.
It's called the Edwardian.

311
00:18:15.345 --> 00:18:17.847
No, the masonry paint.

312
00:18:17.931 --> 00:18:20.517
It's factor 30. I burn.

313
00:18:27.524 --> 00:18:29.567
Here, let me.

314
00:18:38.576 --> 00:18:40.161
I've not seen this before.

315
00:18:40.245 --> 00:18:42.789
What, that?
I got that in Thailand.

316
00:18:42.872 --> 00:18:44.707
It's a yin-yang.

317
00:18:44.791 --> 00:18:46.918
Looks like a road sign.

318
00:18:47.919 --> 00:18:50.672
Yeah, well, it means
"the perfect union
of opposites."

319
00:18:50.755 --> 00:18:53.007
It means "wear some socks."

320
00:18:58.138 --> 00:19:01.182
This is scooped
a bit low, isn't it?

321
00:19:01.266 --> 00:19:04.102
Good job I didn't
put it on backwards.

322
00:19:16.281 --> 00:19:18.491
I think I'll go for a dip.

323
00:19:42.432 --> 00:19:44.434
This is a nudist beach.

324
00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:45.560
No, it's not.

325
00:19:45.643 --> 00:19:48.980
It is. Look.
They're barbecuing!

326
00:19:50.064 --> 00:19:52.901
You see, I couldn't do that.
Barbecue naked.

327
00:19:52.984 --> 00:19:55.695
What is that?
Is that yoga?

328
00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.447
Oh, God.

329
00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:00.992
Grow up, all right.
Back to your magazine.

330
00:20:06.664 --> 00:20:09.292
I can hear you thinking.
It's like this
crunching noise.

331
00:20:09.375 --> 00:20:10.835
The answer is no.

332
00:20:11.252 --> 00:20:13.963
Don't you think we'd
feel more comfortable
with our clothes off?

333
00:20:14.047 --> 00:20:15.757
Unbelievable.
Just unbelievable.

334
00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.008
Well, why not?

335
00:20:17.091 --> 00:20:20.345
The rules.
Not to mention
your girlfriend.

336
00:20:20.428 --> 00:20:21.804
What, Ingrid?
Yeah, Ingrid.

337
00:20:21.888 --> 00:20:23.890
She's very uninhibited.

338
00:20:23.973 --> 00:20:25.826
She'd have had her top off
at the check-in desk.

339
00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:28.144
Well,
as you keep pointing out,
Ingrid used to be a model.

340
00:20:28.228 --> 00:20:30.563
You could be a model.

341
00:20:30.647 --> 00:20:32.899
For a catalog or something.

342
00:20:33.441 --> 00:20:35.944
I'm just saying
that we're not entirely
unknown to each other

343
00:20:36.027 --> 00:20:37.278
from a physical
point of view.

344
00:20:37.362 --> 00:20:38.488
Drop it, Dex.

345
00:20:38.571 --> 00:20:41.407
Well, you know,
that night after graduation.

346
00:20:41.491 --> 00:20:42.909
Come on, you must remember.

347
00:20:42.992 --> 00:20:44.744
No. Blanked it out
like a car crash.

348
00:20:44.827 --> 00:20:47.121
Well, I haven't.

349
00:20:47.205 --> 00:20:49.457
In fact, if I close my eyes,

350
00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:52.168
I can still see you there
just standing in
the dawn light.

351
00:20:52.252 --> 00:20:53.294
Please don't.

352
00:20:53.378 --> 00:20:56.172
Provocatively
unclasping your dungarees

353
00:20:56.256 --> 00:20:57.382
as you walk over to me.

354
00:20:57.465 --> 00:20:59.050
I was not wearing
dungarees.

355
00:20:59.133 --> 00:21:02.053
So you do remember, huh?

356
00:21:07.642 --> 00:21:09.435
Have I caught the sun?

357
00:21:10.103 --> 00:21:12.897
No, you look...

358
00:21:12.981 --> 00:21:14.649
You look fine.

359
00:21:27.412 --> 00:21:28.913
Do you know I've
never been abroad?

360
00:21:28.997 --> 00:21:30.498
What?
Don't be ridiculous.

361
00:21:30.581 --> 00:21:32.000
It's true.

362
00:21:32.083 --> 00:21:35.044
Fortnight in
a caravan in Whitby
drinking Cup-a-Soup with Dad

363
00:21:35.128 --> 00:21:37.505
and trying not to kill Mum.

364
00:21:44.137 --> 00:21:47.223
I can't believe I'm
actually here with you.

365
00:21:48.599 --> 00:21:50.476
Why?
Hmm?

366
00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:51.894
Why?

367
00:21:58.568 --> 00:22:02.613
When we were at university,
before we spoke even,

368
00:22:08.119 --> 00:22:09.120
I had a crush on you.

369
00:22:09.829 --> 00:22:12.874
Ridiculous, I know.

370
00:22:12.957 --> 00:22:17.754
But when we almost

371
00:22:17.837 --> 00:22:19.630
did it that night,

372
00:22:21.799 --> 00:22:23.593
I couldn't believe it.

373
00:22:24.635 --> 00:22:26.929
I wrote poems and everything.

374
00:22:29.557 --> 00:22:31.392
What have you
got to say to that?

375
00:22:31.476 --> 00:22:33.686
Well, I already knew.

376
00:22:36.606 --> 00:22:38.733
What do you mean, you knew?

377
00:22:38.816 --> 00:22:40.860
Well, I sort of guessed.

378
00:22:40.943 --> 00:22:45.490
All those epic letters
and compilation tapes.

379
00:22:46.491 --> 00:22:48.242
So, go on then.
What happened?

380
00:22:48.326 --> 00:22:49.577
Mmm.

381
00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:52.372
I got to know you.
You cured me of you.

382
00:22:54.916 --> 00:22:58.753
I'd still like to
read those poems.
What rhymes with Dexter?

383
00:22:58.836 --> 00:23:01.339
Prick. It's a half-rhyme.

384
00:23:04.509 --> 00:23:07.053
Too much wine. We should go.

385
00:23:07.136 --> 00:23:10.056
No, no, no.
Not yet. Not yet.

386
00:23:10.139 --> 00:23:12.433
Listen,
let's go for a walk.

387
00:23:16.145 --> 00:23:18.648
So this is it.

388
00:23:18.731 --> 00:23:20.316
It's lovely.

389
00:23:23.569 --> 00:23:25.154
Hello? What's going on here?

390
00:23:25.238 --> 00:23:27.573
Well, I thought we'd
go for a quick swim.
Sober us up.

391
00:23:27.657 --> 00:23:30.493
Ah, I get it. I get it.

392
00:23:30.576 --> 00:23:32.453
I've walked right
into it, haven't I?

393
00:23:32.537 --> 00:23:37.041
You get a girl drunk
and lead her to
a large body of water.

394
00:23:37.125 --> 00:23:39.419
Oh, come on, Em.
Be spontaneous.

395
00:23:39.502 --> 00:23:42.130
Be reckless.
Live for the moment!

396
00:23:49.387 --> 00:23:51.139
Come on, Em. Get in!

397
00:23:51.222 --> 00:23:52.473
No!

398
00:23:52.557 --> 00:23:56.477
You're such a prude.
Why are you such a prude?

399
00:23:56.561 --> 00:23:58.229
Look, come on!

400
00:24:01.065 --> 00:24:03.317
You could at least
leave your underpants on.

401
00:24:03.401 --> 00:24:04.902
Rule number three,
remember?

402
00:24:04.986 --> 00:24:06.446
Come on.

403
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:32.346
So this is skinny-dipping?

404
00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:36.934
What am I meant to do?
Sort of lark about?
Splash you or something?

405
00:24:46.611 --> 00:24:49.947
That's a very serious face.

406
00:24:50.031 --> 00:24:51.133
You're not
having a wee, are you?

407
00:24:51.157 --> 00:24:52.533
No.

408
00:24:57.705 --> 00:25:00.875
No, I just wanted
to say that

409
00:25:01.876 --> 00:25:03.169
I felt the same.

410
00:25:05.296 --> 00:25:08.549
After our near-miss.

411
00:25:08.633 --> 00:25:12.512
I mean, I didn't
write poems or anything.
I'm not insane.

412
00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:16.432
But, you know,
I thought about you.

413
00:25:16.974 --> 00:25:18.809
I think about you.

414
00:25:20.603 --> 00:25:22.063
You and me.

415
00:25:22.146 --> 00:25:23.648
Really?

416
00:25:25.358 --> 00:25:28.653
Really? Okay, well...

417
00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:31.989
Dex...

418
00:25:33.491 --> 00:25:35.826
The problem is I fancy
pretty much everyone.

419
00:25:38.287 --> 00:25:40.706
Oh. I see.
I mean anyone.

420
00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:43.501
Really, I mean, it's like
I've just got out of prison,
all the time.

421
00:25:43.584 --> 00:25:45.461
It's a real problem.
I can imagine.

422
00:25:45.545 --> 00:25:48.005
Yeah, and this thing
with Ingrid,
it's a sex thing.

423
00:25:48.089 --> 00:25:50.299
It's just sex,
sex, sex, sex, sex.

424
00:25:50.383 --> 00:25:52.677
The point's been made, Dex.

425
00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:56.347
But me and you,
it would be different.

426
00:26:01.852 --> 00:26:05.106
I think we'd want
different things,

427
00:26:05.189 --> 00:26:07.650
and I don't think
I'm ready, you know.

428
00:26:07.733 --> 00:26:11.362
If you wanted to,
you know, have a bit of fun,

429
00:26:12.405 --> 00:26:14.907
holiday fling,
no obligations.

430
00:26:24.166 --> 00:26:27.086
Oh, God. I'll take that
as a no then, shall I?

431
00:26:27.169 --> 00:26:28.522
I think so. I think
our moment's passed.

432
00:26:28.546 --> 00:26:31.173
Come on, I'm not
expressing myself clearly.

433
00:26:31.257 --> 00:26:33.092
No, no, you are, Dex.
That's the problem.

434
00:26:33.175 --> 00:26:34.552
You're worried I might care.

435
00:26:35.052 --> 00:26:37.722
Hey! Hey, Come back here!

436
00:26:37.805 --> 00:26:40.182
Come back,
you little... Hey!

437
00:26:40.266 --> 00:26:43.603
Thieves!
Come back. Come back here.

438
00:26:43.686 --> 00:26:45.187
Wait!

439
00:26:45.271 --> 00:26:48.065
They've stolen my clothes!
You little...

440
00:26:52.445 --> 00:26:55.448
Will someone call the police?
Wait! Come back!

441
00:26:56.907 --> 00:27:00.453
Could you please stop laughing
and do something to help?

442
00:27:03.414 --> 00:27:05.458
Armani, that suit was.

443
00:27:05.916 --> 00:27:08.210
The little frogs
even took my underpants.

444
00:27:08.294 --> 00:27:09.295
Armani?

445
00:27:09.378 --> 00:27:10.546
No, Calvin Klein.

446
00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:12.131
Oh, Dex, I'm so sorry.

447
00:27:12.256 --> 00:27:13.758
Little French bastards!

448
00:27:13.841 --> 00:27:15.676
They took your
plimsolls, too.

449
00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:18.512
They're not plimsolls.
I've never worn
plimsolls in my life.

450
00:27:18.596 --> 00:27:20.516
They were penny loafers,
and I bloody loved them!

451
00:27:22.016 --> 00:27:25.269
What? It's not funny.
I'm a victim of crime here.

452
00:27:28.105 --> 00:27:29.273
Dex?

453
00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:30.608
What?

454
00:27:32.318 --> 00:27:35.196
Your Calvin Klein
underpants.

455
00:27:35.279 --> 00:27:37.031
I'll find them.

456
00:27:37.114 --> 00:27:39.742
I swear to you,
I shall track them down.

457
00:27:39.825 --> 00:27:42.036
Go to sleep.

458
00:27:47.667 --> 00:27:50.044
I wonder how many
rules we broke.

459
00:27:50.127 --> 00:27:51.962
All of them.

460
00:27:53.005 --> 00:27:54.382
Except Scrabble.

461
00:27:54.465 --> 00:27:56.050
Tomorrow, maybe.

462
00:28:21.742 --> 00:28:23.619
Who says quality TV is dead?

463
00:28:23.703 --> 00:28:25.472
Plenty more of this
when we come back
after the break,

464
00:28:25.496 --> 00:28:26.539
so do not go away.

465
00:28:26.622 --> 00:28:29.208
I'm warning you.
We know where you live.

466
00:28:29.291 --> 00:28:30.835
Go on, get out of here.

467
00:28:48.227 --> 00:28:51.021
Look, I just called,
all right, to let you know

468
00:28:51.147 --> 00:28:53.899
<i>that you are the best friend
I've ever had.</i>

469
00:28:54.024 --> 00:28:56.527
I'm touched, Dex,
but you're off your face.
<i>And?</i>

470
00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:58.487
Look, it's 5:00 in
the morning. Go home.

471
00:28:58.571 --> 00:29:01.782
<i>And you have
an incredible body.</i>

472
00:29:01.866 --> 00:29:03.325
Dex!

473
00:29:03.409 --> 00:29:04.577
Is that Dexter?

474
00:29:05.035 --> 00:29:06.513
<i>Just promise me
you'll go home, please?</i>

475
00:29:06.537 --> 00:29:08.348
I will, I will, I will,
I will, I will, I will.

476
00:29:08.372 --> 00:29:09.972
<i>Dex, you have work
in the morning. Dex...</i>

477
00:29:09.999 --> 00:29:11.459
Look, good night, all right?

478
00:29:11.542 --> 00:29:16.130
Remember, you are absolutely,
truly amazing.

479
00:29:17.798 --> 00:29:20.468
Dexter? Dex?

480
00:29:23.387 --> 00:29:24.972
You're amazing

481
00:29:26.223 --> 00:29:27.975
and famous.

482
00:29:28.058 --> 00:29:29.685
I'm not that famous.

483
00:30:42.633 --> 00:30:46.011
Aye, aye.
How are you, old man?

484
00:30:47.513 --> 00:30:52.309
Your mother's upstairs.
She's been waiting
all morning for you.

485
00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:58.232
Good God, why are
you sweating like that?

486
00:30:59.483 --> 00:31:01.402
Well, it's a hot day.

487
00:31:01.485 --> 00:31:03.696
No, it's not.

488
00:31:03.779 --> 00:31:05.739
Look, how is she?

489
00:31:05.823 --> 00:31:08.409
Well, why don't you
go and see?

490
00:31:14.164 --> 00:31:15.416
Mum?

491
00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:35.102
Hello, hello.

492
00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:37.605
Hello, stranger.

493
00:31:40.608 --> 00:31:43.694
Look, I've got
a present for you here.

494
00:31:43.777 --> 00:31:46.238
It's not from me.
It's from Emma.

495
00:31:46.822 --> 00:31:47.990
Here, let me.

496
00:31:48.115 --> 00:31:49.325
Thank you.

497
00:31:58.542 --> 00:32:01.253
Oh, how lovely.

498
00:32:01.337 --> 00:32:03.923
A little ambitious maybe.

499
00:32:04.006 --> 00:32:07.384
You might want to push her
towards short stories
in the future.

500
00:32:07.468 --> 00:32:09.345
Mum, don't.

501
00:32:15.809 --> 00:32:19.521
So what have you
been up to?

502
00:32:29.657 --> 00:32:32.409
<i>I'm Dexter Mayhew.
What a show we've
got for you tonight.</i>

503
00:32:32.493 --> 00:32:34.495
<i>We've got a man who claims...</i>

504
00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:36.038
I'll skip this next bit.

505
00:32:37.581 --> 00:32:40.501
There's an interview
that's pretty good.

506
00:32:44.672 --> 00:32:46.924
Perhaps I'll watch it later.

507
00:32:49.718 --> 00:32:53.263
The live show is
always a bit patchy.

508
00:32:54.181 --> 00:32:56.517
I don't understand
why you have to
use that voice,

509
00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:59.770
but then I suppose
I just don't care
for this sort of thing.

510
00:32:59.853 --> 00:33:01.981
It's just a bit
of fun for kids.

511
00:33:02.106 --> 00:33:04.274
They just watch it
after the pub.

512
00:33:04.358 --> 00:33:05.776
You mean I'm not drunk enough?

513
00:33:05.943 --> 00:33:07.361
No, it's not that.

514
00:33:07.444 --> 00:33:10.280
You know, honestly, Dexter.
Dancing girls in cages.

515
00:33:10.364 --> 00:33:12.324
Is this what it's come to?

516
00:33:12.408 --> 00:33:13.784
I just host it.

517
00:33:13.867 --> 00:33:15.536
It's a means to an end,
that's all.

518
00:33:15.619 --> 00:33:16.870
But to what end?

519
00:33:16.954 --> 00:33:19.164
We always said
you could do
anything you wanted.

520
00:33:19.248 --> 00:33:21.875
Fine. What do you
want me to do?

521
00:33:21.959 --> 00:33:23.794
Something good.
It is good.

522
00:33:23.877 --> 00:33:28.132
I just do what I'm told.
Look, this is what I can do.

523
00:33:36.473 --> 00:33:38.350
I'm sorry.

524
00:33:38.434 --> 00:33:41.061
The medication makes me ratty.

525
00:33:41.145 --> 00:33:45.482
I just need a little lie-down.
I'll be better tonight.

526
00:33:45.566 --> 00:33:47.985
Yeah, you know, um...

527
00:33:48.068 --> 00:33:51.905
Actually, I've got
this premiere thingy tonight.

528
00:33:51.989 --> 00:33:56.201
Look, I'm sorry.
I can't miss it.
It's <i>Jurassic Park.</i>

529
00:34:03.751 --> 00:34:06.670
I'm afraid I'm going
to need some help.

530
00:34:10.924 --> 00:34:13.677
Are you all right?
Here, put your arm around me.

531
00:34:13.761 --> 00:34:15.637
All right.
All right?

532
00:34:20.976 --> 00:34:21.976
Are you all right?

533
00:34:22.019 --> 00:34:23.020
Yes.

534
00:34:52.341 --> 00:34:56.345
Can I get you anything?
Water? Dry martini?

535
00:35:26.875 --> 00:35:28.293
What time is it?

536
00:35:28.418 --> 00:35:29.920
Quarter past 6:00.

537
00:35:31.296 --> 00:35:33.090
Yeah, I must have dozed off.

538
00:35:33.173 --> 00:35:35.008
I'm afraid
you've missed our day.

539
00:35:35.092 --> 00:35:38.053
Your father's
a little angry with you.

540
00:35:38.137 --> 00:35:40.639
Look, I'll stay tonight.

541
00:35:40.764 --> 00:35:43.267
No. You go.

542
00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:47.938
No pleasure for me
watching you and your father
snarling at each other.

543
00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:52.067
Can I speak frankly?

544
00:35:52.151 --> 00:35:53.360
Do you have to?

545
00:35:53.443 --> 00:35:55.154
I think it's my prerogative.

546
00:35:56.989 --> 00:36:03.203
I know that you're
going to be a fine man.
Decent, loving, accomplished.

547
00:36:03.287 --> 00:36:05.581
But I don't think
you're there yet.

548
00:36:05.664 --> 00:36:09.585
And right now, well, I worry

549
00:36:13.213 --> 00:36:15.799
that you're not
very nice anymore.

550
00:36:21.346 --> 00:36:22.906
Well, there's
nothing I can say to that.

551
00:36:22.973 --> 00:36:25.142
There is nothing you have to.

552
00:36:36.111 --> 00:36:37.671
I'm not going to
argue with you.

553
00:36:37.696 --> 00:36:40.449
You can come and
collect your car
when you're sober.

554
00:36:40.532 --> 00:36:44.411
You're being ridiculous.
I mean, you cannot
confiscate my car key.

555
00:36:44.494 --> 00:36:47.206
Do not dare to
insult my intelligence!

556
00:36:48.165 --> 00:36:50.709
Now your mother
loves you very much.
You know that.

557
00:36:50.792 --> 00:36:53.712
But for whatever time
she has left to her...

558
00:36:58.217 --> 00:37:03.972
If you ever, ever
come to see your mother
in this state again,

559
00:37:04.056 --> 00:37:06.266
I will not let you
in the house.

560
00:37:06.350 --> 00:37:08.685
I will close the door
in your face. Now...

561
00:37:11.897 --> 00:37:12.898
Go.

562
00:37:14.524 --> 00:37:15.817
Fine.

563
00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:34.920
You're not there.
I just remembered
you're on a hot date tonight.

564
00:37:36.046 --> 00:37:37.923
I'm too late.

565
00:37:40.342 --> 00:37:41.969
Okay, can you call me
when you get this?

566
00:37:42.052 --> 00:37:44.471
It's just I need
to speak to someone.

567
00:37:44.554 --> 00:37:47.224
Not someone. You.

568
00:37:50.435 --> 00:37:52.980
A chainsaw for an arm.
It was mad.

569
00:37:53.063 --> 00:37:54.398
It's a work of
timeless beauty.

570
00:37:54.481 --> 00:37:56.817
It's the finest of
the trilogy, methinks.

571
00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:59.736
And I still understood it
without seeing <i>Evil Dead I</i>
or <i>Evil Dead II.</i>

572
00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:03.156
My only complaint would be
that there wasn't
enough violence.

573
00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:07.119
You didn't mind, did you?
Or did you want to
see <i>Three Colors: Blue?</i>

574
00:38:07.202 --> 00:38:10.789
I'm gonna skip a starter
because I had those nachos,

575
00:38:10.872 --> 00:38:14.835
but you go ahead.
You can have
anything you like.

576
00:38:16.211 --> 00:38:18.880
Anything up to
the value of, say, £14.00?

577
00:38:19.756 --> 00:38:22.384
No, no, seriously,
no, have anything.

578
00:38:22.467 --> 00:38:24.553
Well, you know,
within reason.

579
00:38:27.055 --> 00:38:29.641
It's just so good
to see you again.

580
00:38:30.684 --> 00:38:32.936
And you're going to be
an amazing teacher.

581
00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:34.688
Congratulations.
Thanks.

582
00:38:34.771 --> 00:38:36.898
I wish I'd had more
teachers like you.

583
00:38:36.982 --> 00:38:40.694
Not that I'd have
got any work done.
Miss Morley.

584
00:38:47.409 --> 00:38:50.662
<i>You have no new messages.</i>

585
00:38:57.336 --> 00:38:59.629
Comedy's a cruel mistress.

586
00:39:00.839 --> 00:39:02.716
Sometimes, Emma,
I think the only way

587
00:39:02.799 --> 00:39:03.943
I'm going to see
my name up in lights

588
00:39:03.967 --> 00:39:06.678
is if I change it
to Emergency Exit.

589
00:39:06.762 --> 00:39:11.725
Anyway, I'm doing
an improvisation night
at the moment.

590
00:39:11.808 --> 00:39:13.435
Mr. Giggles.
Not his real name.

591
00:39:13.518 --> 00:39:16.104
But I think I'm gonna stick
to the more
observational material.

592
00:39:16.188 --> 00:39:17.540
I've got this whole
thing at the moment

593
00:39:17.564 --> 00:39:18.958
about the difference
between cats and dogs.

594
00:39:18.982 --> 00:39:20.567
Hey, please stop.

595
00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:22.003
Okay. Do you know
what the hardest thing

596
00:39:22.027 --> 00:39:23.379
about being
a stand-up comedian is?

597
00:39:23.403 --> 00:39:24.821
Is it the clothes?

598
00:39:24.946 --> 00:39:26.323
Very good. No.

599
00:39:27.157 --> 00:39:29.117
It's that people expect you
to be on all the time.

600
00:39:29.159 --> 00:39:31.578
Because if you're
not being funny,
then what are you being?

601
00:39:31.661 --> 00:39:32.996
Ian, it's not a performance.

602
00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:35.957
Except it sort of is,
though, isn't it?

603
00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:42.089
I've been so excited
about seeing you.
Like nervous.

604
00:39:50.639 --> 00:39:51.765
I'm sorry, I...

605
00:39:51.848 --> 00:39:53.159
I'm no good at
this stuff, either.

606
00:39:53.183 --> 00:39:55.936
It's just I graduated today.

607
00:39:56.019 --> 00:40:00.148
I'm finally,
actually qualified
to do something useful,

608
00:40:00.232 --> 00:40:03.026
and I wanted to
celebrate with someone.

609
00:40:03.110 --> 00:40:04.403
Was Dexter busy?

610
00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:16.748
Em, when you hear this,
can you just get in a cab?
And I'll pay.

611
00:40:17.916 --> 00:40:23.171
Maybe you could even
stay over, you know,
on the sofa or something?

612
00:40:23.255 --> 00:40:25.632
I need to just see you.

613
00:40:25.715 --> 00:40:28.593
Please,
can you just come over?

614
00:40:31.221 --> 00:40:33.181
Emma Morley?
Hmm?

615
00:40:33.265 --> 00:40:34.558
Can I say something?

616
00:40:35.058 --> 00:40:36.393
Go on.

617
00:40:37.811 --> 00:40:42.065
I think you are
the absolute bollocks.

618
00:40:42.149 --> 00:40:44.359
You, with your honeyed words.

619
00:40:51.032 --> 00:40:52.409
I should probably
head home.

620
00:40:52.909 --> 00:40:54.703
Don't go.
Let's go somewhere else.

621
00:40:56.371 --> 00:41:01.293
I live near, actually.
I mean, it's a dump,
like, horrible.

622
00:41:01.376 --> 00:41:05.505
But I've got music and booze.

623
00:41:05.589 --> 00:41:07.007
Or a hot, milky drink
if you prefer.

624
00:41:07.924 --> 00:41:10.719
We could go on
an Ovaltine bender.

625
00:41:17.476 --> 00:41:21.313
All right. Okay.
One, two, three, go!

626
00:41:22.772 --> 00:41:23.772
Which way?

627
00:41:23.815 --> 00:41:25.317
This way, this way,
this way!

628
00:41:37.496 --> 00:41:40.332
That's not needy.
That's just affection.

629
00:41:40.415 --> 00:41:43.418
I've just got
a lot of love to give.

630
00:41:47.506 --> 00:41:51.301
Well, if I can't call you,
can I come and see you?

631
00:41:54.638 --> 00:41:56.223
Do you know where
the matches are?

632
00:41:56.306 --> 00:41:57.390
No.

633
00:41:57.474 --> 00:42:00.602
You might wanna leave it
for a couple of minutes. Go.

634
00:42:07.984 --> 00:42:09.402
Hi, Miss Morley.
Hi.

635
00:42:09.486 --> 00:42:11.404
There gonna be
a showbiz party afterwards

636
00:42:11.488 --> 00:42:14.407
with champagne, and canapés,
and the tinkle of laughter?

637
00:42:14.491 --> 00:42:17.285
It's a school play, Ian.
I suspect we'll be
home by half 9:00.

638
00:42:17.369 --> 00:42:20.330
Why don't you stay
at mine for a change?
I'll wash my duvet cover.

639
00:42:20.830 --> 00:42:22.230
Is that your boyfriend,
Miss Morley?

640
00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:24.000
Oy! Cheeky.

641
00:42:25.085 --> 00:42:27.963
Greetings, boys and girls.
Welcome to
the <i>Late Night Lock In.</i>

642
00:42:28.046 --> 00:42:30.048
Camera one, Dexter.

643
00:42:30.131 --> 00:42:32.008
The show that is late,
live and loud.

644
00:42:32.175 --> 00:42:34.094
Dexter,
gentleman to see you.

645
00:42:34.177 --> 00:42:35.177
Mind the cables, sir.

646
00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:37.097
Hey.
Okay, ladies.

647
00:42:41.268 --> 00:42:44.020
I helped myself
to tea and buns.

648
00:42:44.187 --> 00:42:45.947
I hope I'm not going
to get you into trouble.

649
00:42:47.023 --> 00:42:48.191
I'm sure it'll be fine.

650
00:42:48.316 --> 00:42:49.442
There he is! Hey!

651
00:42:49.526 --> 00:42:52.946
Doesn't he look gorgeous?
Come to Suki.

652
00:42:53.029 --> 00:42:55.615
Suki Sue. Come here.

653
00:42:56.950 --> 00:43:00.912
I just want to
eat you up.

654
00:43:02.831 --> 00:43:07.043
Suki, actually,
look, this is my father.

655
00:43:07.127 --> 00:43:08.837
Wotcha, Mr. M.

656
00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:11.131
Isn't your son gorgeous?

657
00:43:11.214 --> 00:43:12.591
Um, he's very nice.

658
00:43:12.674 --> 00:43:14.551
And where's Mrs. M?

659
00:43:16.344 --> 00:43:18.722
Sadly, she passed away.

660
00:43:21.808 --> 00:43:24.853
Barry, I need some water.

661
00:43:24.936 --> 00:43:26.438
What an appalling woman.

662
00:43:26.521 --> 00:43:29.024
Actually,
she's sort of my girlfriend.

663
00:43:29.107 --> 00:43:31.401
Oh, well, congratulations.

664
00:43:33.862 --> 00:43:37.407
Your mother would have been
most impressed.

665
00:43:39.993 --> 00:43:41.161
Thanks, Dad.

666
00:43:41.244 --> 00:43:43.413
I'll be watching at home
if I can stay awake.

667
00:43:44.039 --> 00:43:47.000
Have fun

668
00:43:47.083 --> 00:43:49.544
and don't take any notice
of what they say
in the papers.

669
00:43:49.628 --> 00:43:51.838
Okay, sir. If you'd
like to come this way.

670
00:43:51.921 --> 00:43:53.048
Please.

671
00:43:54.507 --> 00:43:56.635
I'm the king of
car crash television.

672
00:43:56.718 --> 00:43:58.154
But you're the king of it.
That's good.

673
00:43:58.178 --> 00:44:00.305
Caption under photo. "Odious."

674
00:44:01.306 --> 00:44:02.641
<i>Why can't you come again?</i>

675
00:44:02.766 --> 00:44:04.100
Because I'm working.

676
00:44:04.184 --> 00:44:06.102
I'll send a car to
come and pick you up.

677
00:44:06.269 --> 00:44:08.188
Dex, I can't.

678
00:44:08.271 --> 00:44:12.067
<i>I know, and I'm sorry.
I'm just so much better
when you're around.</i>

679
00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:13.652
Look, I'm just worried
I'm gonna be

680
00:44:13.777 --> 00:44:15.278
stood in front of
the camera thinking,

681
00:44:15.362 --> 00:44:16.863
"What's the bloody point?"

682
00:44:16.946 --> 00:44:19.240
<i>The show's ridiculous.
I'm such a fraud, Em.</i>

683
00:44:19.324 --> 00:44:21.451
Hey, come on. That's enough.

684
00:44:21.534 --> 00:44:24.120
<i>You know what you're doing.
You'll be fine.</i>

685
00:44:24.204 --> 00:44:25.205
Right.

686
00:44:25.288 --> 00:44:28.041
Just don't speak
in that weird voice, okay?

687
00:44:28.124 --> 00:44:30.168
<i>Okay.</i>
All right. Bye.

688
00:44:32.796 --> 00:44:34.047
Get ready. Here we go.

689
00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:35.882
Great stuff.
Let's move. Let's move!

690
00:44:35.965 --> 00:44:37.342
Okay, come on, guys. Let's go.

691
00:44:37.967 --> 00:44:40.053
We're on, superstar.

692
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:57.654
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to <i>Late Night Lock In.</i>

693
00:44:57.737 --> 00:44:59.656
The show that is late, live...

694
00:44:59.823 --> 00:45:01.741
And loud!

695
00:45:01.825 --> 00:45:03.952
And what a show
we've got for you tonight.

696
00:45:06.496 --> 00:45:07.956
Yay!

697
00:45:10.333 --> 00:45:12.210
Well done,
darling.

698
00:45:13.336 --> 00:45:14.337
Thank you.

699
00:45:14.421 --> 00:45:16.464
Come on, Miss Morley.

700
00:45:16.548 --> 00:45:17.882
Bravo!

701
00:45:28.184 --> 00:45:31.271
The Maxi Crew,
ladies and gentlemen.
The Maxi Crew.

702
00:45:31.354 --> 00:45:35.650
All right, take a seat,
fellas. Take a seat.
You can sit down there.

703
00:45:35.734 --> 00:45:40.530
Right, guys,
I just wanna start by saying
that that jam was fresh.

704
00:45:40.613 --> 00:45:44.242
<i>Right, okay,
so let's kick it off with...
Let's ask some questions.</i>

705
00:45:44.325 --> 00:45:47.871
<i>What is hip hop?
Is this the voice
from the street?</i>

706
00:45:47.954 --> 00:45:51.040
<i>Is this why you guys
are just so angry?</i>

707
00:45:51.124 --> 00:45:52.333
<i>No, dawg.</i>

708
00:45:52.417 --> 00:45:54.043
<i>It's chill,
it's chill, it's chill.</i>

709
00:45:56.838 --> 00:46:00.550
<i>Right, okay. Listen,
can you rap about anything?</i>

710
00:46:00.633 --> 00:46:03.136
<i>For example, could you rap
about a cheese sandwich?</i>

711
00:46:03.219 --> 00:46:06.181
<i>Are you new here?
Have you done this before?</i>

712
00:46:07.807 --> 00:46:11.227
<i>Oh, dear.
Do not try this at home.</i>

713
00:46:16.566 --> 00:46:17.567
Ian?

714
00:46:17.901 --> 00:46:19.378
Do you think you'll
finish painting today?

715
00:46:19.402 --> 00:46:21.946
I'd like to at least
get the TV back inside.

716
00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:24.908
All right, all right.
I can have breakfast first,
can't I?

717
00:46:24.991 --> 00:46:26.117
We've had breakfast.

718
00:46:26.201 --> 00:46:28.620
All right, brunch, then.

719
00:46:28.703 --> 00:46:30.914
Brunch. Is it lunch?
Is it breakfast?

720
00:46:31.039 --> 00:46:33.249
No, it's brunch.
What about brinner, say?

721
00:46:33.333 --> 00:46:34.918
Or brupper?

722
00:46:35.001 --> 00:46:36.544
Well, I should get on.

723
00:46:36.669 --> 00:46:38.213
Bearhug, snootch?

724
00:46:38.296 --> 00:46:40.131
I thought we agreed
about snootch?

725
00:46:40.215 --> 00:46:43.760
I can't seem to say
anything right
these days, can I?

726
00:46:44.761 --> 00:46:46.513
Look, if you don't
want me to go tonight...

727
00:46:46.638 --> 00:46:48.389
No, you should go.

728
00:46:48.473 --> 00:46:50.016
Or if you wanted
to come with us...

729
00:46:50.099 --> 00:46:52.685
What? Dexter ignoring me,
and you talking over me?
No, thank you.

730
00:46:52.769 --> 00:46:53.812
It won't be like that.

731
00:46:53.937 --> 00:46:55.080
Anyway,
I've got a gig tonight

732
00:46:55.104 --> 00:46:57.065
at The Rose & Crown,
Sir Laffalots.

733
00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:59.192
Paid gig?

734
00:46:59.275 --> 00:47:00.443
No.

735
00:47:00.610 --> 00:47:01.778
Better get back
to it then.

736
00:47:01.861 --> 00:47:04.197
Thirty-four identical essays
on <i>Lord of the Flies.</i>

737
00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:09.953
Em? About 1700 hours,
do you fancy
a little bit of the old...

738
00:47:10.912 --> 00:47:13.289
You know,
afternoon delight?

739
00:47:31.266 --> 00:47:32.392
Wow!

740
00:47:33.101 --> 00:47:34.644
You look incredible.

741
00:47:34.727 --> 00:47:36.396
Oh... Ooh!

742
00:47:36.479 --> 00:47:38.356
Let's see the dress.

743
00:47:39.983 --> 00:47:41.109
Is it vintage?

744
00:47:41.192 --> 00:47:42.235
No, it's brand new.

745
00:47:42.318 --> 00:47:43.736
Really?
Mmm.

746
00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:46.114
Well, you look great,
and I love the shoes.

747
00:47:46.197 --> 00:47:49.617
Thank you.
It's the world's first
orthopedic high heel.

748
00:47:49.701 --> 00:47:52.287
Look, it's been too long, Em.

749
00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:55.707
I need to have
some fun tonight.
Can we have fun, please?

750
00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:57.030
God, sorry.

751
00:47:58.835 --> 00:48:00.062
Look, I'll be two seconds.
It's work.

752
00:48:00.086 --> 00:48:01.212
<i>I'm naked!</i>

753
00:48:01.296 --> 00:48:02.505
Suki, you nutter.

754
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:03.798
<i>Where are you, baby?</i>

755
00:48:03.882 --> 00:48:05.682
I thought you
were supposed to be
at the party.

756
00:48:06.509 --> 00:48:08.511
You do know they
damage your brain?

757
00:48:08.636 --> 00:48:10.597
They do not damage
your brain.

758
00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:12.181
How can you tell?

759
00:48:12.348 --> 00:48:13.850
Ha ha,
very funny, Em.

760
00:48:13.933 --> 00:48:16.493
I guarantee you,
one year, one year,
and you'll have one of these.

761
00:48:16.561 --> 00:48:20.440
You're on.
If I ever get a mobile phone,
you can buy me dinner.

762
00:48:20.523 --> 00:48:22.525
What, again?

763
00:48:23.735 --> 00:48:27.363
So, come on.
How's the king of comedy?

764
00:48:27.447 --> 00:48:29.657
Oh, Ian's fine.
We both are.

765
00:48:29.741 --> 00:48:31.367
Are you still
very much in love?

766
00:48:31.451 --> 00:48:35.288
He can belch
the theme to <i>The A-Team.</i>
I'm only flesh and blood.

767
00:48:35.371 --> 00:48:38.625
I don't know. These days,
we don't seem to...

768
00:48:38.708 --> 00:48:41.502
And how's the new place?
How's that?

769
00:48:41.586 --> 00:48:45.381
Flat's fine.
Well, it's a room and a half
in murder mile.

770
00:48:45.465 --> 00:48:47.008
And Ian's been
talking about painting

771
00:48:47.091 --> 00:48:48.968
the same wall
for the past six months.

772
00:48:49.052 --> 00:48:52.722
But it's got potential.
There's a view.
The Gasworks.

773
00:48:54.557 --> 00:48:56.309
You should come round.

774
00:48:56.392 --> 00:48:57.894
Mmm! Mmm.

775
00:49:02.065 --> 00:49:03.691
How's Suki?

776
00:49:03.775 --> 00:49:05.985
Oh, she's fantastic.
Yeah, gorgeous.

777
00:49:06.069 --> 00:49:08.422
What's great for me is
that she really
understands the industry.

778
00:49:08.446 --> 00:49:10.865
You know, she knows exactly
what it's like to be...

779
00:49:12.575 --> 00:49:15.286
I was gonna say "famous."
God, we hate the word.

780
00:49:15.370 --> 00:49:16.913
Every time
I turn on the telly,

781
00:49:16.996 --> 00:49:18.498
she's there in
a pink rubber catsuit.

782
00:49:18.581 --> 00:49:20.291
She's doing incredibly well.

783
00:49:20.416 --> 00:49:22.168
Yeah, yeah.

784
00:49:22.251 --> 00:49:24.087
Well, we both are.

785
00:49:24.921 --> 00:49:28.216
I've got some really, really
exciting stuff coming up.

786
00:49:28.299 --> 00:49:29.968
It's all sort of
in development.

787
00:49:30.051 --> 00:49:32.178
If I told you,
I'd have to shoot you.

788
00:49:32.261 --> 00:49:33.638
Please do.

789
00:49:35.598 --> 00:49:39.102
Never mind.
Start without me, all right?

790
00:49:55.618 --> 00:49:56.619
Hello.

791
00:49:56.703 --> 00:49:58.663
There you are. Enjoy.

792
00:49:58.746 --> 00:50:00.790
What are you doing,
you silly thing?

793
00:50:00.957 --> 00:50:03.001
Well, listen,
we'll talk later.

794
00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:08.256
Look at this.
This looks gorgeous.

795
00:50:08.339 --> 00:50:10.174
Are you all right?
Maybe she could join us?

796
00:50:10.258 --> 00:50:14.345
Hey, hey, hey, what's this?
I'm here to see you, remember?

797
00:50:14.429 --> 00:50:17.306
Right, well,
how's the teaching?

798
00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:19.851
What?
If you're not interested,
don't ask.

799
00:50:19.934 --> 00:50:21.477
I am interested.

800
00:50:21.561 --> 00:50:23.998
I just thought you were going
to be writing this novel,
that's all.

801
00:50:24.022 --> 00:50:26.149
And I will.
But I have to earn a living.

802
00:50:26.232 --> 00:50:28.711
More to the point, I enjoy it.
I'm a bloody good teacher,
Dexter.

803
00:50:28.735 --> 00:50:31.070
I'm sure you are.

804
00:50:31.154 --> 00:50:32.488
Still, you know
what they say?

805
00:50:32.572 --> 00:50:34.073
No, what do they say?

806
00:50:34.157 --> 00:50:36.409
You know, "Those who can..."

807
00:50:36.492 --> 00:50:40.663
No, I'm sorry.
I'm not familiar.
Finish the sentence.

808
00:50:42.123 --> 00:50:45.293
All right.
Well, "Those who can, do,

809
00:50:45.376 --> 00:50:48.171
"and those who can't, teach."

810
00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:53.968
And those who can teach say,
"Go fuck yourself!"

811
00:50:55.678 --> 00:50:58.723
Em! Em, come on.
Look, whatever
I've done, I'm sorry.

812
00:50:58.806 --> 00:51:00.409
You've obviously
had a bit too much to drink.

813
00:51:00.433 --> 00:51:02.268
No, you're drunk!
You're drunk!

814
00:51:02.351 --> 00:51:06.147
Do you realize that I have
literally not seen you sober
for three years?

815
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:08.066
Nipping off to
the toilet every 10 minutes.

816
00:51:08.149 --> 00:51:09.989
Either you're on coke,
or you've got dysentery.

817
00:51:10.026 --> 00:51:12.904
Either way, it's boring!
Banging on about
yourself all the time.

818
00:51:12.987 --> 00:51:16.908
Well, I wouldn't mind, Dex,
but you're a TV presenter,
all right?

819
00:51:16.991 --> 00:51:18.326
You've not
invented penicillin.

820
00:51:18.409 --> 00:51:20.387
All you do is
stand around shouting,
"Make some noise!"

821
00:51:20.411 --> 00:51:22.538
Look, I am having fun,
that's all.

822
00:51:22.705 --> 00:51:24.791
I've been through
a lot recently.

823
00:51:24.874 --> 00:51:26.074
I might get
a bit carried away,

824
00:51:26.209 --> 00:51:27.436
but if you wouldn't
stop getting at me...

825
00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:29.629
Am I?
I don't mean to, and I...

826
00:51:29.712 --> 00:51:33.174
I know that you've
been through a lot
with your mum and all, I know.

827
00:51:33.257 --> 00:51:37.470
But, there are things
that I needed to
talk to you about.

828
00:51:37.553 --> 00:51:41.766
About how I am
stuck in this flat

829
00:51:41.849 --> 00:51:43.392
with a man that I am
not in love with.

830
00:51:43.476 --> 00:51:47.814
And if I can't talk to you,
then what is the point
of you? Of us?

831
00:51:47.897 --> 00:51:49.440
What do you mean,
"What's the point?"

832
00:51:49.565 --> 00:51:51.150
I think we've
outgrown each other.

833
00:51:51.234 --> 00:51:54.529
No, you have outgrown me.
You think I'm
uncool and dreary.

834
00:51:54.612 --> 00:51:56.447
I don't think
you're dreary. Em...

835
00:51:56.531 --> 00:52:01.160
I think if it's over,
then we should just
face facts. Say goodbye.

836
00:52:01.244 --> 00:52:02.745
It sounds like
you're dumping me.

837
00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:04.330
Yeah, maybe I am.

838
00:52:04.413 --> 00:52:06.124
You're not who you used to be.

839
00:52:06.207 --> 00:52:09.252
Come on, Em.
Look, I apologize!

840
00:52:10.545 --> 00:52:11.921
Please.

841
00:52:18.094 --> 00:52:20.138
Come on. That's it.

842
00:52:22.098 --> 00:52:23.516
There.

843
00:52:25.268 --> 00:52:29.272
I love you, Dexter. So much.

844
00:52:32.108 --> 00:52:34.777
I just don't
like you anymore.

845
00:52:35.194 --> 00:52:37.363
I'm sorry.

846
00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:14.984
<i>Johnny Cage wins.</i>

847
00:53:15.067 --> 00:53:17.904
That's an almighty win
from the Blade Cruisers there.

848
00:53:17.987 --> 00:53:20.489
I think you'll all agree.
Well done, guys.

849
00:53:20.573 --> 00:53:23.910
That's all from
tonight's <i>Joy Stick Jockeys.</i>
Join us next week

850
00:53:23.993 --> 00:53:27.830
when we review the smoking hot
new console games
coming at you.

851
00:53:27.914 --> 00:53:31.167
Until then, night owls,
keep gaming.

852
00:53:35.922 --> 00:53:39.008
Do I really have to
say "smoking hot"?

853
00:53:40.718 --> 00:53:43.554
It's just I'm 32,
for God's sake.

854
00:53:45.431 --> 00:53:47.183
What, they're sacking me?

855
00:53:47.266 --> 00:53:49.518
You see, sack has
negative connotations.

856
00:53:49.602 --> 00:53:52.563
It's just they wanna
try a new presenter.

857
00:53:53.689 --> 00:53:55.191
So they are sacking me?

858
00:53:55.274 --> 00:53:57.377
Well, no,
they're taking the show
in a different direction,

859
00:53:57.401 --> 00:54:00.655
but it's a direction
away from you.

860
00:54:00.738 --> 00:54:02.073
Okay, so less you now.

861
00:54:02.156 --> 00:54:03.156
Okay.

862
00:54:03.199 --> 00:54:04.992
More you in your 20s.

863
00:54:07.703 --> 00:54:09.956
Right. Right.

864
00:54:10.039 --> 00:54:11.999
So, what's the good news?

865
00:54:12.083 --> 00:54:14.168
Sorry?

866
00:54:14.252 --> 00:54:18.547
Well, you said you
had some bad news.
What's the good news?

867
00:54:25.221 --> 00:54:27.640
Every career has
its ups and downs.

868
00:54:27.765 --> 00:54:30.184
This is just
a bloody great down.

869
00:54:30.268 --> 00:54:31.978
And I sense a bit of
disenchantment, Dexy.

870
00:54:32.061 --> 00:54:34.272
Just a little concerned
about my future.

871
00:54:34.355 --> 00:54:37.149
It's not quite
what I was expecting.

872
00:54:37.233 --> 00:54:41.404
The future never is.
That's what makes it
so bloody exciting!

873
00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:45.157
Everyone loves you, yeah?

874
00:54:45.241 --> 00:54:49.453
But they love you
in that ironic,
love-to-hate kind of way.

875
00:54:49.537 --> 00:54:51.122
Right?
And all that we need to do

876
00:54:51.205 --> 00:54:53.582
is just find someone
that loves you for real.

877
00:54:56.085 --> 00:54:57.712
Okay?
Yeah.

878
00:55:02.508 --> 00:55:04.093
I love you, Sylvie.

879
00:55:05.094 --> 00:55:08.389
No, no, wait.
No, I'm in love with you.

880
00:55:08.472 --> 00:55:11.642
Look, I've never said
this to anyone before.

881
00:55:11.726 --> 00:55:13.477
Well, that's a lie. Um...

882
00:55:15.229 --> 00:55:17.273
I love you, Sylvie. I...

883
00:55:20.276 --> 00:55:24.071
Sylvie tells me
you used to be
quite well known.

884
00:55:24.155 --> 00:55:25.865
TV presenter or something.

885
00:55:25.948 --> 00:55:28.826
I did. Yeah.
Once upon a time.

886
00:55:28.909 --> 00:55:32.580
Yes, on <i>Larginit.</i>
That program.
Do you remember, Mummy?

887
00:55:32.663 --> 00:55:33.873
You used to really hate it.

888
00:55:33.956 --> 00:55:34.957
Yes.

889
00:55:35.041 --> 00:55:36.667
"Turn it off,"
she used to say.

890
00:55:36.751 --> 00:55:39.086
"Turn it off. It's
killing your brain cells."

891
00:55:39.170 --> 00:55:40.838
That was you, was it?

892
00:55:40.921 --> 00:55:42.590
You still work
in television, Dexter?

893
00:55:42.673 --> 00:55:46.552
Not so much, no.
That sort of
drifted away, really.

894
00:55:46.635 --> 00:55:47.678
Uh-huh.

895
00:55:47.762 --> 00:55:50.973
Dexter's just being modest.
He gets lots of offers.

896
00:55:51.057 --> 00:55:52.892
Anyway,
what he really wants to do
is produce.

897
00:55:56.479 --> 00:55:57.813
Party games.

898
00:56:01.233 --> 00:56:02.610
Are you there,
Moriarty?

899
00:56:02.735 --> 00:56:04.111
Here.

900
00:56:05.488 --> 00:56:06.655
Two for two,
nice work, bro.

901
00:56:06.739 --> 00:56:07.799
Going for a hat trick.

902
00:56:07.823 --> 00:56:10.034
Are you there, Moriarty?

903
00:56:10.117 --> 00:56:11.285
Here.

904
00:56:15.331 --> 00:56:16.665
The crowd goes wild!

905
00:56:17.833 --> 00:56:19.502
There's my boy!

906
00:56:19.585 --> 00:56:20.937
Better luck
next time, son.
Thank you.

907
00:56:20.961 --> 00:56:23.506
Well, I'm still
very proud of you.

908
00:56:25.174 --> 00:56:26.675
Oh, isn't this fun?

909
00:56:26.759 --> 00:56:28.928
Dexter, care to
take me on?
Oh, no.

910
00:56:29.011 --> 00:56:30.054
That's a terrific idea.

911
00:56:30.137 --> 00:56:31.138
Darling, are you sure?

912
00:56:31.222 --> 00:56:32.848
Yes, I'm sure.

913
00:56:33.307 --> 00:56:35.101
Come on, chap.
Pick up your weapon.

914
00:56:35.184 --> 00:56:37.269
Nice and tight, Mum.

915
00:56:39.438 --> 00:56:40.815
- All right?
- All right.

916
00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:43.442
Very good.
We don't
want you cheating.

917
00:56:43.526 --> 00:56:45.444
Good luck.
All right.

918
00:56:45.528 --> 00:56:47.405
Come on, sis.

919
00:56:53.494 --> 00:56:56.288
All right, ready?

920
00:56:56.372 --> 00:56:57.873
As ready as I'll...

921
00:56:57.957 --> 00:57:01.752
Good God, man!
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

922
00:57:01.877 --> 00:57:03.717
That table
was from Italy.
I'm so sorry.

923
00:57:03.754 --> 00:57:06.006
I must have just caught her
at a funny angle there.

924
00:57:06.090 --> 00:57:08.884
You didn't even ask
if she was there, Moriarty.

925
00:57:08.968 --> 00:57:12.888
I know. I know. I'm so sorry.
Look, I don't know
what I was thinking.

926
00:57:12.972 --> 00:57:14.390
Wanker!

927
00:57:26.861 --> 00:57:29.238
Serves me right
for not changing the locks.

928
00:57:29.321 --> 00:57:30.489
Looking good, Ian.

929
00:57:30.614 --> 00:57:31.824
You can get stuffed, Emma.

930
00:57:31.907 --> 00:57:32.907
Is that from your act?

931
00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:35.995
No, though I have
got this new thing
I've been working on.

932
00:57:36.078 --> 00:57:37.371
God.

933
00:57:37.455 --> 00:57:40.499
I come on, and I say,
"Here's a funny story.
You'll like this."

934
00:57:40.583 --> 00:57:42.835
Ian.
"There's this guy,

935
00:57:42.918 --> 00:57:46.338
"and he's going out
with this girl,
and he worships her,

936
00:57:46.422 --> 00:57:48.883
"and they buy
this flat together.

937
00:57:48.966 --> 00:57:51.802
"And then he gets her
an engagement ring, the lot.

938
00:57:51.886 --> 00:57:56.724
"It turns out
that she is still in love
with her best friend."

939
00:57:56.807 --> 00:57:59.977
Interesting theory, Ian,
except I've not
seen Dexter for ages.

940
00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:01.770
No?
That is not the reason.

941
00:58:01.854 --> 00:58:06.817
Do you know how he
found out about it?
He read it in her poetry.

942
00:58:06.901 --> 00:58:08.194
You bastard!

943
00:58:08.277 --> 00:58:10.196
Give it back to me!
"Our graduation night!

944
00:58:10.279 --> 00:58:12.323
"The erotic intensity
of the shared bed."

945
00:58:12.406 --> 00:58:15.367
"That magic week in France."
It's all here in blank verse.

946
00:58:15.451 --> 00:58:18.037
If you ever,
ever, come in here again
I will call the police!

947
00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:19.760
Call the bloody police!
It's my flat, too!

948
00:58:19.830 --> 00:58:21.999
Is it? I paid the mortgage!

949
00:58:22.082 --> 00:58:25.586
You just sat around farting
and watching
the bloody <i>Wrath of Khan!</i>

950
00:58:25.669 --> 00:58:26.837
You love <i>The Wrath of Khan.</i>

951
00:58:26.921 --> 00:58:29.632
I hate <i>The Wrath of Khan.</i>

952
00:58:33.594 --> 00:58:36.305
It's a good job
we didn't get married.

953
00:58:39.350 --> 00:58:41.894
I'm sorry about going
through all your stuff.

954
00:58:41.977 --> 00:58:44.563
I've just been a bit mad
recently, that's all.

955
00:58:44.647 --> 00:58:46.398
It's all right.

956
00:58:49.235 --> 00:58:51.237
I miss you.

957
00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:52.613
I know you do.

958
00:58:52.696 --> 00:58:54.698
Like, right here.

959
00:58:58.827 --> 00:59:01.747
Either that, or it's
trapped wind. I'm not sure.

960
00:59:01.830 --> 00:59:03.916
Either way, it'll pass.

961
00:59:03.999 --> 00:59:05.960
It's good, by the way.

962
00:59:06.043 --> 00:59:08.587
Not the poems.
The poems are awful,

963
00:59:08.671 --> 00:59:12.591
but the rest of the stuff,
the stories. You're funny.

964
00:59:12.675 --> 00:59:14.552
Proper funny.

965
00:59:14.635 --> 00:59:15.886
Not like me.
Ian.

966
00:59:15.970 --> 00:59:17.656
No, I'm just saying
that you should
show them to someone,

967
00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:20.558
because you're
better than you know.

968
00:59:35.030 --> 00:59:36.240
Oh!

969
01:00:44.350 --> 01:00:47.895
So that's Emma Morley.
We went to
university together.

970
01:00:47.978 --> 01:00:49.229
Did you sleep
with her as well?

971
01:00:49.355 --> 01:00:50.564
No.

972
01:00:50.648 --> 01:00:51.815
What about the bride?

973
01:00:51.899 --> 01:00:53.776
No.
God, what is this?

974
01:00:54.943 --> 01:00:58.364
It's just that every weekend
we go to a wedding

975
01:00:58.447 --> 01:01:01.033
with a coachload of people
that you've slept with.

976
01:01:01.116 --> 01:01:02.451
It's like a conference.

977
01:01:02.576 --> 01:01:03.827
Okay. Come on.

978
01:01:03.952 --> 01:01:05.597
You know you're
the only one for me now.

979
01:01:05.621 --> 01:01:08.332
You are. Come on,
come here. Come here.

980
01:01:13.587 --> 01:01:16.048
Hummus wraps.
Organic smoothies.

981
01:01:16.131 --> 01:01:17.883
Fair Trade coffees.

982
01:01:19.593 --> 01:01:23.347
Crayfish. Dex, people go crazy
for the little buggers.

983
01:01:25.099 --> 01:01:28.727
I've got 12 branches
already. Twelve more
by the end of the year.

984
01:01:28.811 --> 01:01:30.372
Well, you know,
there's a rumor going around

985
01:01:30.396 --> 01:01:32.064
that you're actually
a multi millionaire.

986
01:01:32.189 --> 01:01:33.857
Come on.

987
01:01:34.608 --> 01:01:36.360
Well, define multi.

988
01:01:40.364 --> 01:01:42.991
You should come
and have lunch.
We should talk.

989
01:01:43.075 --> 01:01:44.493
What, are you
offering me a job?

990
01:01:44.618 --> 01:01:46.036
No, I'm just saying...

991
01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:48.580
You are, aren't you?
You're offering me a job.

992
01:01:48.664 --> 01:01:51.083
Look, I haven't seen you
on telly for a while.

993
01:01:51.166 --> 01:01:53.127
I thought if you
wanted a fresh start...

994
01:01:53.252 --> 01:01:55.212
Callum, mate.
Mate, mate, mate.

995
01:01:55.295 --> 01:01:58.340
At university,
you wore the same
pair of jeans for...

996
01:01:58.424 --> 01:02:00.384
What was it, four years?

997
01:02:01.468 --> 01:02:03.345
Long time ago now, pal.

998
01:02:04.930 --> 01:02:06.598
We're not students
anymore.

999
01:02:06.682 --> 01:02:07.933
Someone seems
to be enjoying it.

1000
01:02:08.016 --> 01:02:09.184
Look, look over here.

1001
01:02:09.268 --> 01:02:10.811
Have you
seen Emma Morley?

1002
01:02:10.894 --> 01:02:13.439
Right under our noses
all this time. Eh?

1003
01:02:14.273 --> 01:02:15.649
Who knew?

1004
01:02:17.067 --> 01:02:20.154
<i>I sit and wait</i>

1005
01:02:20.237 --> 01:02:23.365
<i>Does an angel</i>

1006
01:02:23.449 --> 01:02:26.827
<i>Contemplate my fate</i>

1007
01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:32.583
<i>Do they know</i>

1008
01:02:32.666 --> 01:02:35.753
I tell you,
the one discovery
changed my life.

1009
01:02:36.712 --> 01:02:38.881
Crayfish.

1010
01:02:38.964 --> 01:02:42.009
I've got 12 branches
already. Another 12
by the end of the year.

1011
01:02:42.092 --> 01:02:44.112
I was telling Dexter
there's plenty
of opportunities.

1012
01:02:44.136 --> 01:02:46.430
Darling,
I'll be back in a bit.

1013
01:02:49.475 --> 01:02:50.976
Do you want some champagne?

1014
01:02:51.059 --> 01:02:53.437
It's not champagne.
It's Spanish.

1015
01:02:56.148 --> 01:02:59.526
<i>When I'm lying in my bed</i>

1016
01:02:59.610 --> 01:03:02.529
<i>Thoughts running
through my head</i>

1017
01:03:02.613 --> 01:03:05.407
<i>And I feel that love is dead</i>

1018
01:03:06.575 --> 01:03:09.995
<i>I'm loving angels instead</i>

1019
01:03:10.078 --> 01:03:11.264
Do you want to
get out of here?

1020
01:03:11.288 --> 01:03:12.456
Yes, please.

1021
01:03:12.539 --> 01:03:17.211
<i>And through it all
She offers me protection</i>

1022
01:03:17.294 --> 01:03:19.797
<i>A lot of love and affection</i>

1023
01:03:20.339 --> 01:03:24.259
Today must be
quite tough for you,
having slept with the bride.

1024
01:03:25.677 --> 01:03:28.222
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1025
01:03:28.305 --> 01:03:31.600
What? How do you
know all these things?

1026
01:03:31.683 --> 01:03:33.519
Tilly told me all about it.
Oh, did she?

1027
01:03:33.602 --> 01:03:36.563
The foot massage
spun out of control.

1028
01:03:36.647 --> 01:03:39.233
I think you even
used my olive oil.

1029
01:03:39.316 --> 01:03:42.027
Footprints halfway
up the kitchen wall.

1030
01:03:42.778 --> 01:03:45.489
Well, that stuff's
behind me now, so...

1031
01:03:45.572 --> 01:03:46.907
Really, what happened?

1032
01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:49.660
Sex in toilet cubicles
lose its bittersweet charm?

1033
01:03:49.743 --> 01:03:52.329
Well, an orgy won't keep you
warm at night, Emma.

1034
01:03:52.412 --> 01:03:54.248
An orgy won't look after you
when you're old.

1035
01:03:54.331 --> 01:03:55.666
Well said.

1036
01:03:59.002 --> 01:04:02.130
Anyway,
I screwed up my career.

1037
01:04:02.214 --> 01:04:04.299
And screwed up
things with Mum.

1038
01:04:05.634 --> 01:04:07.845
That's not true.

1039
01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:11.139
And I screwed up
my friendships.

1040
01:04:14.017 --> 01:04:17.646
And then Sylvie
just came along.

1041
01:04:19.815 --> 01:04:22.693
And she sort of,
well, saved me, really.

1042
01:04:23.986 --> 01:04:25.946
She's very beautiful.

1043
01:04:26.029 --> 01:04:28.657
Of course, she has absolutely
no sense of humor.

1044
01:04:29.324 --> 01:04:31.869
Just as well.
A sense of humor's
overrated.

1045
01:04:31.952 --> 01:04:34.079
Goofing around all the time.

1046
01:04:34.162 --> 01:04:36.331
The only time Ian
ever really made me laugh

1047
01:04:36.415 --> 01:04:37.916
was when he fell
down the stairs.

1048
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.961
Well, you know,
Sylvie says she
doesn't like to laugh.

1049
01:04:41.044 --> 01:04:44.339
Doesn't really like
what it does to her face.

1050
01:04:49.636 --> 01:04:51.597
But you love her, right?

1051
01:04:55.684 --> 01:04:57.477
Yeah, I worship her.

1052
01:04:58.186 --> 01:05:04.234
<i>I'm loving Colin instead</i>

1053
01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:11.074
Oh, no, no. This way.

1054
01:05:11.158 --> 01:05:12.534
Where are we going?

1055
01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:14.536
Dex?

1056
01:05:18.415 --> 01:05:19.625
Oh!

1057
01:05:22.711 --> 01:05:25.255
So, come on, then.
You, huh?

1058
01:05:25.339 --> 01:05:27.132
Any romance?

1059
01:05:27.215 --> 01:05:28.675
Don't start, Dex.

1060
01:05:28.759 --> 01:05:29.760
What?

1061
01:05:29.843 --> 01:05:33.764
Your sympathy.
I'm not lonely. I'm alone.

1062
01:05:33.847 --> 01:05:35.599
There, how'd that sound?

1063
01:05:35.682 --> 01:05:37.643
Yeah, yeah.
I bought that.

1064
01:05:37.726 --> 01:05:38.977
It's true.

1065
01:05:41.521 --> 01:05:44.399
I've got a tiny advance
to write this book.

1066
01:05:44.983 --> 01:05:46.234
Em!

1067
01:05:46.443 --> 01:05:47.569
Mmm-hmm.

1068
01:05:51.156 --> 01:05:54.868
Well, you know,
I have something
to tell you, too.

1069
01:06:01.083 --> 01:06:02.834
You're getting married.

1070
01:06:02.918 --> 01:06:04.461
Yeah.

1071
01:06:09.716 --> 01:06:10.842
So, you're pleased?

1072
01:06:10.926 --> 01:06:14.179
Of course I'm pleased, Dex.
Fantastic news, really.

1073
01:06:16.431 --> 01:06:19.685
Scented?
Your wedding invitations
are scented.

1074
01:06:19.768 --> 01:06:21.687
Yeah, lavender.

1075
01:06:21.770 --> 01:06:24.856
No, Dex, it's money.
They smell of money.

1076
01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:31.655
August 14th?

1077
01:06:31.738 --> 01:06:35.367
Yeah, I think that's
what they call
a shotgun wedding.

1078
01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:38.620
For 350.

1079
01:06:40.288 --> 01:06:41.790
With buffet.

1080
01:06:53.802 --> 01:06:55.262
Do you know
who the father is?

1081
01:06:55.345 --> 01:06:56.722
Stop it.

1082
01:06:56.805 --> 01:06:58.640
I'm kidding.

1083
01:06:58.724 --> 01:06:59.766
Congratulations.

1084
01:06:59.850 --> 01:07:00.851
Thank you.

1085
01:07:00.934 --> 01:07:02.477
A dad.
I know.

1086
01:07:03.437 --> 01:07:05.480
Is that allowed?
Will they let you?

1087
01:07:05.605 --> 01:07:07.649
It's incredible, isn't it?

1088
01:07:07.733 --> 01:07:10.902
You're going to be
a wonderful father.

1089
01:07:10.986 --> 01:07:12.404
Do you really think so?

1090
01:07:12.487 --> 01:07:14.197
I don't doubt it
for a minute.

1091
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.877
I missed you, Dex.

1092
01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:30.881
Well, I missed you, too.

1093
01:07:40.515 --> 01:07:42.350
No more disappearing.

1094
01:07:43.935 --> 01:07:46.229
No, well, I won't
if you won't.

1095
01:07:47.606 --> 01:07:48.982
Mmm?
Mmm.

1096
01:08:01.745 --> 01:08:02.871
Dex?

1097
01:08:04.498 --> 01:08:06.041
We should go.

1098
01:08:08.418 --> 01:08:10.337
Absolutely, let's go.

1099
01:08:16.968 --> 01:08:19.096
Come on, Jasmine.
Come on.

1100
01:08:21.598 --> 01:08:24.059
Come on.
You gonna stop crying?

1101
01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:46.331
How you getting on?

1102
01:08:46.414 --> 01:08:48.375
Good, mate.
Good. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1103
01:08:48.458 --> 01:08:49.769
Not quite what
I was expecting, but...

1104
01:08:49.793 --> 01:08:50.794
How do you mean?

1105
01:08:50.877 --> 01:08:53.839
Well, you see the words
organic and homemade...

1106
01:08:53.922 --> 01:08:55.924
Yeah, I know.
You imagined
a couple of hippies

1107
01:08:56.007 --> 01:08:58.844
on a little farm somewhere,
knitting their own muesli.

1108
01:08:58.927 --> 01:09:00.929
Nice idea,
but this is business, Dex.

1109
01:09:01.012 --> 01:09:03.265
Yeah, well, I realize that.
Here's your last two.

1110
01:09:04.099 --> 01:09:08.019
Listen, mate.
You're only here to
learn the ropes, okay?

1111
01:09:08.103 --> 01:09:09.604
Company policy.
Everyone has to.

1112
01:09:09.688 --> 01:09:12.023
Callum, I'm enjoying it.

1113
01:09:12.107 --> 01:09:13.525
Honestly, I'm good.

1114
01:09:15.193 --> 01:09:16.987
There's plenty
of formula left.

1115
01:09:17.070 --> 01:09:20.448
I've pureed the veggies,
or you could mash a banana.

1116
01:09:20.532 --> 01:09:24.202
And what about Indian food?
I can give her a curry,
can't I?

1117
01:09:24.286 --> 01:09:26.454
No, no, no, Dexter. No.

1118
01:09:26.538 --> 01:09:27.914
Sylvie, I'm joking.

1119
01:09:28.039 --> 01:09:29.374
Oh, I see.

1120
01:09:29.457 --> 01:09:31.293
I keep missing those, don't I?

1121
01:09:31.376 --> 01:09:33.044
I'm sorry.
It's just that I'm late.

1122
01:09:33.170 --> 01:09:34.838
I don't even
know why I'm going.

1123
01:09:34.921 --> 01:09:36.798
I'm too old for hen nights.
No, you're not.

1124
01:09:36.882 --> 01:09:37.966
That's my cab.

1125
01:09:38.133 --> 01:09:39.217
Right, come on, then.

1126
01:09:39.301 --> 01:09:40.594
I'll be back
tomorrow morning.

1127
01:09:40.719 --> 01:09:42.012
Okay.

1128
01:09:42.095 --> 01:09:43.930
Be good. Try not to
burn the house down.

1129
01:09:44.014 --> 01:09:45.094
I'll be fine. I'll be fine.

1130
01:09:48.435 --> 01:09:50.687
Goodbye, my sweetheart.
Say goodbye to Mummy.

1131
01:09:50.770 --> 01:09:52.230
Say goodbye to Mummy.

1132
01:09:52.314 --> 01:09:55.317
Oh, I know, honey.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1133
01:09:57.986 --> 01:09:59.654
Have a good time.

1134
01:10:05.327 --> 01:10:09.080
Oh! Come on.
We'll be all right,
won't we?

1135
01:10:09.164 --> 01:10:11.791
<i>Party started
there's no end in sight</i>

1136
01:10:11.875 --> 01:10:14.502
<i>Everybody's moving
to the rhythm that's inside</i>

1137
01:10:15.921 --> 01:10:21.718
<i>It's a crazy world
but tonight's
the right situation</i>

1138
01:10:22.177 --> 01:10:24.387
I am Spartacus.

1139
01:10:27.557 --> 01:10:29.643
No, I'm Spartacus.

1140
01:10:30.393 --> 01:10:33.104
No, I'm Spartacus.
I'm Spartacus.

1141
01:10:33.188 --> 01:10:35.499
<i>Wahey! Let's have a big hand
and give a round
of applause...</i>

1142
01:10:35.523 --> 01:10:37.442
Look, Jas.
Look, that's Daddy's ex.

1143
01:10:37.525 --> 01:10:39.611
<i>...for basketball
stars TJ and Mickey D!</i>

1144
01:10:39.694 --> 01:10:41.112
Isn't she loud?

1145
01:10:41.196 --> 01:10:43.949
<i>Can you even fit
them in a two-shot?</i>

1146
01:10:44.032 --> 01:10:47.661
<i>They are so tall.
I'm practically
melting over here.</i>

1147
01:10:48.495 --> 01:10:50.455
Isn't she a loud, loud girl?

1148
01:10:52.999 --> 01:10:55.877
"Julie Criscoll,
aged 15, wanted

1149
01:10:56.044 --> 01:10:58.922
"nothing more than
to change the world.

1150
01:10:59.923 --> 01:11:03.134
"If only all the politicians
would actually listen."

1151
01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:07.097
Yeah, well that's Em.

1152
01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:10.225
Is that Em? Yeah, that's Em.
She wrote the book.

1153
01:11:15.021 --> 01:11:16.189
Emma?

1154
01:11:16.314 --> 01:11:17.482
It's me.

1155
01:11:17.565 --> 01:11:18.942
<i>I'm so sorry, darling.</i>

1156
01:11:19.025 --> 01:11:22.362
Look, how's the party going?
How's it all going?

1157
01:11:22.696 --> 01:11:23.780
Um...

1158
01:11:23.905 --> 01:11:25.991
We're all going on
to some club. How is she?

1159
01:11:26.074 --> 01:11:27.867
Asleep. You know, finally.

1160
01:11:27.951 --> 01:11:30.245
<i>She's been awake
all this time?</i>

1161
01:11:30.328 --> 01:11:33.248
Yeah, my fault.
I should have
given her the decaf.

1162
01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.544
<i>See? There you go.
I made you laugh.</i>

1163
01:11:40.213 --> 01:11:41.589
Are you all right?

1164
01:11:41.673 --> 01:11:43.925
<i>Yeah.
No, no, I'm good. I'm good.</i>

1165
01:11:44.009 --> 01:11:45.176
<i>Why? Were you worried?</i>

1166
01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:46.428
Oh, no. Um...

1167
01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:49.431
No reason. I just...

1168
01:11:51.224 --> 01:11:53.351
Well, I was just
checking up on you and...

1169
01:11:53.435 --> 01:11:54.811
<i>Well, everything's fine.</i>

1170
01:11:55.729 --> 01:11:57.105
All right.

1171
01:11:58.064 --> 01:11:59.774
Look, Sylvie,

1172
01:12:00.608 --> 01:12:04.863
I know I'm not
good at all this,
you know, dad/husband thing.

1173
01:12:05.989 --> 01:12:08.366
You're doing fine, Dexter.

1174
01:12:08.450 --> 01:12:10.452
No, and I know
if you had a receipt,

1175
01:12:10.535 --> 01:12:12.829
you would have taken me back
a long time ago.

1176
01:12:12.912 --> 01:12:17.917
<i>But, you know,
I'm working on it, all right?
So bear with me. That's all.</i>

1177
01:12:19.169 --> 01:12:20.795
I've got to go.

1178
01:12:22.255 --> 01:12:24.090
I'll see you tomorrow.
<i>All right.</i>

1179
01:12:24.174 --> 01:12:26.134
Night.
<i>Good night.</i>

1180
01:13:28.988 --> 01:13:29.988
Funny?

1181
01:13:30.031 --> 01:13:31.032
Very funny.

1182
01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:36.579
Well, look at you.
You even look like a writer.

1183
01:13:37.372 --> 01:13:39.207
A writer in Paris.

1184
01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:42.252
There's a word for this,
isn't there?

1185
01:13:42.335 --> 01:13:44.129
Uh, butch.

1186
01:13:44.212 --> 01:13:45.922
I was gonna say <i>gamine.</i>

1187
01:13:46.673 --> 01:13:47.924
What do you look like?

1188
01:13:48.007 --> 01:13:49.968
Me? A screwed-up divorcé.

1189
01:13:52.554 --> 01:13:56.349
So my apartment's not far.
Shall we?

1190
01:13:56.433 --> 01:13:58.560
How long are you staying for?

1191
01:13:58.643 --> 01:14:01.729
I suppose it's up to you,
really. It's just...

1192
01:14:02.605 --> 01:14:04.399
Look, I just
wanted to say something

1193
01:14:04.524 --> 01:14:06.276
which I couldn't
really do over the phone.

1194
01:14:06.359 --> 01:14:08.570
Well, ever since we
were last together
in London...

1195
01:14:08.653 --> 01:14:11.865
Dexter, before you say
anything else, I have to...

1196
01:14:13.741 --> 01:14:16.578
There's something
I have to tell you.

1197
01:14:18.455 --> 01:14:19.706
You've met someone!

1198
01:14:19.789 --> 01:14:21.624
Is that really
so hard to believe?

1199
01:14:21.708 --> 01:14:23.543
A man?
Yes, a man. A guy.

1200
01:14:23.626 --> 01:14:26.504
A guy! He's a guy now,
is he? I see.

1201
01:14:26.588 --> 01:14:29.299
He's called Jean-Pierre,
Jean-Pierre Dusollier.

1202
01:14:29.382 --> 01:14:30.550
What, he's French?

1203
01:14:30.633 --> 01:14:31.759
No, Dex, he's Welsh.

1204
01:14:32.093 --> 01:14:37.223
He's handsome. He's charming.
He's just very, very French.

1205
01:14:37.307 --> 01:14:39.142
What, you mean rude?

1206
01:14:39.225 --> 01:14:40.768
No.
Arrogant?

1207
01:14:40.852 --> 01:14:42.812
Smokes too much,
wears a string of onions.

1208
01:14:42.896 --> 01:14:45.064
Why are you being like this?

1209
01:14:45.148 --> 01:14:47.988
Oh, God, you mean sexy.
Is that what you mean?
You're having lots of sex?

1210
01:14:48.067 --> 01:14:49.753
Since when do I need
to ask your permission?

1211
01:14:49.777 --> 01:14:51.237
God knows
you never asked mine.

1212
01:14:51.738 --> 01:14:53.948
But we just slept together.

1213
01:14:57.535 --> 01:14:59.120
I haven't forgotten.

1214
01:15:04.626 --> 01:15:06.878
Dexter, we got
a bit drunk.

1215
01:15:06.961 --> 01:15:08.588
Yeah, not that drunk.

1216
01:15:08.671 --> 01:15:10.548
You took your trousers off
over your shoes.

1217
01:15:10.632 --> 01:15:12.133
No, I didn't.

1218
01:15:13.593 --> 01:15:14.594
Did I?

1219
01:15:14.677 --> 01:15:18.389
I think that you were upset
about Sylvie and the divorce,

1220
01:15:18.473 --> 01:15:20.850
and you needed
a shoulder to cry on.

1221
01:15:20.934 --> 01:15:22.477
Or sleep with.

1222
01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:26.147
And that's what I was,
a shoulder to sleep with.

1223
01:15:26.231 --> 01:15:28.983
And that's why
you did it, was it?
To cheer me up.

1224
01:15:29.067 --> 01:15:30.193
Well, it worked, didn't it?

1225
01:15:37.992 --> 01:15:41.746
If you must know,
it was one of
the better nights of my life.

1226
01:15:41.829 --> 01:15:43.039
See?

1227
01:15:45.041 --> 01:15:46.626
Don't fish.

1228
01:15:48.127 --> 01:15:50.088
Dex, it was one time.

1229
01:15:51.756 --> 01:15:53.841
Well, it was three times.

1230
01:15:56.678 --> 01:16:00.056
Come on.
Look, you don't
think it's a good idea?

1231
01:16:00.139 --> 01:16:01.849
You and me.

1232
01:16:04.185 --> 01:16:06.104
I do. I did.

1233
01:16:06.187 --> 01:16:07.272
In the late '80s.

1234
01:16:07.355 --> 01:16:08.398
Right.

1235
01:16:12.777 --> 01:16:14.112
Better get going.

1236
01:16:14.237 --> 01:16:15.613
Why? What are we doing?

1237
01:16:15.697 --> 01:16:17.031
Jean-Pierre wants
to meet you.

1238
01:16:17.156 --> 01:16:18.449
Oh, you're kidding.

1239
01:16:18.533 --> 01:16:20.493
We're going to
hear him play.

1240
01:16:20.577 --> 01:16:21.619
Play?

1241
01:16:21.703 --> 01:16:22.704
He's a jazz musician.

1242
01:16:24.497 --> 01:16:25.498
Bastard.

1243
01:16:25.582 --> 01:16:28.602
We're going to listen to him
play free jazz on the piano
for about nine hours,

1244
01:16:28.626 --> 01:16:31.379
and it's going
to be lots of fun
and in no way awkward.

1245
01:16:57.905 --> 01:17:00.617
You're not going out
like that, are you?

1246
01:17:01.993 --> 01:17:03.369
Just do me up.

1247
01:17:07.915 --> 01:17:09.334
That's Jean-Pierre.

1248
01:17:09.417 --> 01:17:10.585
Where?

1249
01:17:11.836 --> 01:17:15.923
Oh, God.
You could have at least found
someone a bit good-looking.

1250
01:17:18.926 --> 01:17:23.181
You know, Em,
I'm sure he's
a fine jazz pianist.

1251
01:17:23.264 --> 01:17:25.350
I just don't think
I can do this.

1252
01:17:26.267 --> 01:17:27.518
Oh. Really?

1253
01:17:27.602 --> 01:17:32.148
Yeah,
I'll just go and see a movie
and go back to the apartment.

1254
01:17:32.231 --> 01:17:35.777
And then I think I'm going
to get the first train
back tomorrow.

1255
01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:37.111
You don't have to leave.

1256
01:17:37.278 --> 01:17:38.571
I think I do.

1257
01:17:44.744 --> 01:17:46.663
I'm sorry, Dex.

1258
01:17:46.746 --> 01:17:49.082
Hey, don't be.

1259
01:17:55.421 --> 01:17:56.631
Go on.

1260
01:18:09.310 --> 01:18:11.312
<i>Salut.</i>
Hey.

1261
01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:15.918
Wait! Dexter!

1262
01:19:22.884 --> 01:19:25.011
I thought I got rid of you.

1263
01:19:38.065 --> 01:19:39.984
If you muck me about,
Dexter...

1264
01:19:40.109 --> 01:19:42.069
Em, I swear.
I swear I won't.

1265
01:19:42.153 --> 01:19:44.322
Lead me on, or let me down,
or go behind my back,

1266
01:19:44.405 --> 01:19:45.573
I will murder you.

1267
01:19:45.656 --> 01:19:46.699
I won't do that.

1268
01:19:47.909 --> 01:19:49.202
You swear?

1269
01:19:51.537 --> 01:19:54.957
Yeah, I swear. I swear.

1270
01:20:16.103 --> 01:20:18.981
I would like
to thank everyone
for coming to our wedding.

1271
01:20:19.065 --> 01:20:23.236
For what can only be described
as a whirlwind romance.

1272
01:20:23.319 --> 01:20:24.487
Pause for laughter.

1273
01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:32.787
Seriously, when people ask
how Emma and I first met,

1274
01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:35.790
I tell them that
we grew up together.

1275
01:20:36.123 --> 01:20:37.959
Blah, blah, blah.
Blah, blah, blah.

1276
01:20:38.042 --> 01:20:40.103
You're not going to say,
"Blah, blah, blah,"
on the day, are you?

1277
01:20:40.127 --> 01:20:41.396
You are not supposed
to be hearing this.

1278
01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:42.547
What if I have notes?

1279
01:20:42.630 --> 01:20:43.756
Come on, let me see.

1280
01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:45.341
No, no.

1281
01:20:45.424 --> 01:20:47.593
When we're married,
you're going to
have to obey me.

1282
01:20:47.677 --> 01:20:50.304
Yeah, I'm sure
that's going to happen.

1283
01:20:51.472 --> 01:20:54.976
What? Not again?

1284
01:20:55.059 --> 01:20:56.477
You don't mind, do you?

1285
01:20:56.644 --> 01:20:58.104
No, I don't mind.

1286
01:20:59.814 --> 01:21:02.817
Although, there are
health and safety issues.

1287
01:21:03.693 --> 01:21:05.778
I could lose my license.

1288
01:21:21.043 --> 01:21:23.504
They'll wonder
where we've got to.

1289
01:21:30.511 --> 01:21:31.512
Mmm! Mmm.

1290
01:21:31.596 --> 01:21:34.724
I can definitely
smell burning.

1291
01:21:38.603 --> 01:21:39.729
Hello, hello.

1292
01:21:39.854 --> 01:21:41.022
Hi, there.

1293
01:21:41.105 --> 01:21:43.691
Come here, you.
Here we go.

1294
01:21:43.774 --> 01:21:46.736
Do you want to
give me a big kiss?
Give me a big kiss.

1295
01:21:46.819 --> 01:21:48.571
Go on.

1296
01:21:48.654 --> 01:21:51.449
TV between 5:30 and 6:00,
but no more.

1297
01:21:51.532 --> 01:21:53.367
And she has to
be in bed by 7:30.

1298
01:21:53.534 --> 01:21:55.369
All right,
do you want to run inside?

1299
01:21:55.453 --> 01:21:56.913
Go see Emma. Good girl.

1300
01:21:56.996 --> 01:21:58.289
I'm out here, Jasmine.

1301
01:21:58.372 --> 01:22:00.750
She's loving coming
here at the moment.

1302
01:22:00.875 --> 01:22:02.084
Well, good. That's great.

1303
01:22:02.168 --> 01:22:04.795
I'm really pleased for you.

1304
01:22:04.879 --> 01:22:06.422
Look, I'd invite you in.
It's just...

1305
01:22:06.505 --> 01:22:09.800
No, it's fine.
We've got to go
and see my family.

1306
01:22:09.884 --> 01:22:11.552
Have fun.
Thanks.

1307
01:22:14.931 --> 01:22:16.891
In you get,
Moriarty.

1308
01:22:25.733 --> 01:22:27.526
Dexter?
Yeah.

1309
01:22:27.610 --> 01:22:29.445
I've been thinking.

1310
01:22:31.697 --> 01:22:33.115
So have I.

1311
01:22:41.916 --> 01:22:45.252
I want a child
with the man I love.

1312
01:22:47.755 --> 01:22:50.841
And if he won't do it,
then I want one with you.

1313
01:22:56.597 --> 01:22:59.517
Well, then,
we'd better get started.

1314
01:23:43.686 --> 01:23:45.271
I look so tired.

1315
01:23:45.354 --> 01:23:47.732
So take some exercise.
Come swimming with me later.

1316
01:23:47.815 --> 01:23:51.193
No, no, I can't.
I've got to do too much
at the cafe.

1317
01:23:51.277 --> 01:23:52.903
Fine. Don't.

1318
01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:57.825
By the way,
in case you're interested,
I'm not pregnant.

1319
01:24:01.162 --> 01:24:02.496
Em, how do you know?

1320
01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:04.165
How do you think?

1321
01:24:04.248 --> 01:24:05.875
We could try again, though.

1322
01:24:07.168 --> 01:24:10.379
Come on, look...
No, no, no, no. Come on.

1323
01:24:12.465 --> 01:24:15.176
Look, I'm sorry.
All right?

1324
01:24:17.344 --> 01:24:19.805
No, I am
for taking it out on you.

1325
01:24:22.433 --> 01:24:24.977
We're not at our best today,
are we?

1326
01:24:26.353 --> 01:24:31.609
Listen,
why don't we meet each other
after work?

1327
01:24:31.692 --> 01:24:34.945
We'll go to the movies.
Your choice.

1328
01:24:35.029 --> 01:24:36.947
Something with subtitles.

1329
01:24:37.031 --> 01:24:38.365
Ooh.

1330
01:24:39.366 --> 01:24:41.952
And we can go
and have some dinner.
Just you and me,

1331
01:24:42.036 --> 01:24:46.040
and we can work this out.
All right?

1332
01:24:46.123 --> 01:24:47.500
I promise.
Mmm-hmm.

1333
01:24:47.625 --> 01:24:48.959
Yeah.

1334
01:24:49.043 --> 01:24:50.211
Okay.

1335
01:25:33.921 --> 01:25:35.923
Thank you.
Thanks a lot.

1336
01:25:40.136 --> 01:25:44.807
Hey, there.
Just to say I'm running late,
but I'm on my way.

1337
01:25:44.890 --> 01:25:47.810
I'm sorry for being
so snappy this morning.

1338
01:26:40.738 --> 01:26:44.575
<i>Hey, there.
Just to say I'm running late,
but I'm on my way.</i>

1339
01:26:45.701 --> 01:26:49.121
<i>And I'm sorry
for being so snappy
this morning.</i>

1340
01:26:49.205 --> 01:26:52.416
<i>I just wanted to say
you're a fine thing,
Dexter Mayhew.</i>

1341
01:26:52.499 --> 01:26:54.460
<i>I love you very much.</i>

1342
01:26:54.543 --> 01:26:57.129
<i>Okay, there you go. Lucky you!</i>

1343
01:28:41.150 --> 01:28:42.234
Dad.

1344
01:28:47.614 --> 01:28:49.199
Dexter?
Hello, darling.

1345
01:28:50.784 --> 01:28:52.411
Jasmine!

1346
01:28:55.748 --> 01:28:58.792
Are you all right?
Go and get dressed.

1347
01:28:59.835 --> 01:29:01.337
Sylvie, Sylvie.
Dexter?

1348
01:29:01.420 --> 01:29:04.715
Sylvie, Sylvie,
I screwed up.

1349
01:29:04.798 --> 01:29:05.883
Jasmine, now!

1350
01:29:05.966 --> 01:29:07.634
I screwed up.

1351
01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:09.386
It's all right.
You're all right.

1352
01:29:09.470 --> 01:29:11.221
No, I screwed up.

1353
01:29:11.347 --> 01:29:13.140
Come on, let's get you up.
Come on.

1354
01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:20.272
I'm so sorry.

1355
01:29:20.356 --> 01:29:21.440
It's all right.

1356
01:29:21.523 --> 01:29:23.025
Aw, Dex, come on.

1357
01:29:25.319 --> 01:29:27.613
You poor thing.

1358
01:29:31.992 --> 01:29:34.495
Oh, God. Dexter.

1359
01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:20.207
<i>As the rain
came down, the water
levels began to rise.</i>

1360
01:30:20.290 --> 01:30:25.879
So is this going to
be an annual festival,
do you think?

1361
01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:28.882
Every year, 15th of July?

1362
01:30:30.467 --> 01:30:32.970
Well, I hope not.

1363
01:30:33.053 --> 01:30:35.472
I don't want
a heart-to-heart.

1364
01:30:37.933 --> 01:30:39.017
Do you?

1365
01:30:39.101 --> 01:30:41.812
No, no. I'd rather not.

1366
01:30:41.895 --> 01:30:45.649
Except to say, that I think
the best thing
that you could do

1367
01:30:47.151 --> 01:30:51.864
would be to try
to live your life
as if Emma was still here.

1368
01:30:54.491 --> 01:30:55.909
Don't you?

1369
01:31:02.082 --> 01:31:03.167
I don't know if I can.

1370
01:31:03.250 --> 01:31:04.626
Of course you can.

1371
01:31:08.297 --> 01:31:12.134
What do you think
I've been doing
for the past 10 years?

1372
01:31:20.392 --> 01:31:25.689
Now <i>Silent Witness</i> is on.
9:00.

1373
01:31:30.944 --> 01:31:32.279
Right.

1374
01:31:44.666 --> 01:31:46.043
Ian. God!

1375
01:31:46.126 --> 01:31:47.127
Dexter.

1376
01:31:47.211 --> 01:31:48.879
Hi.
Hello, mate.

1377
01:31:48.962 --> 01:31:51.381
Are you well?
Yeah, look at this.

1378
01:31:52.549 --> 01:31:54.885
So, how are you?
How's the stand-up comedy?

1379
01:31:54.968 --> 01:31:56.803
Oh, well,
I gave that up, actually.

1380
01:31:56.929 --> 01:31:57.971
That's a shame.

1381
01:31:58.055 --> 01:32:01.558
No, not really,
because I was never any good.

1382
01:32:01.642 --> 01:32:03.560
The only time
I ever made Emma laugh

1383
01:32:03.644 --> 01:32:06.146
was when I fell down
the stairs. Really.

1384
01:32:07.564 --> 01:32:09.441
No, I'm in insurance now.

1385
01:32:09.733 --> 01:32:11.652
Great, great.

1386
01:32:16.156 --> 01:32:19.409
I hate today.
Fifteenth of July.

1387
01:32:21.703 --> 01:32:23.664
Saint Swithin's Day.

1388
01:32:24.831 --> 01:32:26.291
It's a tough one.

1389
01:32:26.375 --> 01:32:32.381
I never noticed it before,
but it was always there
just waiting, lurking.

1390
01:32:34.091 --> 01:32:36.093
I used to hate you, too.

1391
01:32:36.176 --> 01:32:39.513
Quite violently,
actually, Dexter.
No, I'm sorry, but...

1392
01:32:39.596 --> 01:32:44.643
Because, she lit up with you.

1393
01:32:46.853 --> 01:32:50.023
Just in a way that
she never would with me,

1394
01:32:50.107 --> 01:32:53.151
and it used to make me
so angry because...

1395
01:32:54.027 --> 01:32:58.282
I didn't think
that you deserved her.
Can I say this?

1396
01:32:58.365 --> 01:33:00.075
Yeah, go on.

1397
01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:01.910
She made you decent.

1398
01:33:04.121 --> 01:33:09.626
And then in return,
you made her so happy.

1399
01:33:09.710 --> 01:33:11.128
So happy.

1400
01:33:13.255 --> 01:33:17.593
And I will always be
grateful to you for that.

1401
01:33:21.388 --> 01:33:26.310
And on that bombshell,
back to the sticks.

1402
01:33:26.393 --> 01:33:28.186
There's my lot out there.
Oh! Look at them.

1403
01:33:28.270 --> 01:33:30.022
Yeah, I know.

1404
01:33:31.898 --> 01:33:34.901
So, listen,
we'll stay in touch.
I'll give you a call.

1405
01:33:34.985 --> 01:33:38.739
No, I don't think
that's necessary.
I think we're done here.

1406
01:33:40.115 --> 01:33:41.408
Come here.

1407
01:33:42.618 --> 01:33:43.869
Good luck, mate. All right?

1408
01:33:43.994 --> 01:33:45.245
You, too.

1409
01:33:45.329 --> 01:33:46.663
Thank you.

1410
01:33:53.962 --> 01:33:55.422
You've got cake
everywhere.

1411
01:33:59.426 --> 01:34:00.719
<i>Wake up.</i>

1412
01:34:02.929 --> 01:34:04.348
<i>Wake up.</i>

1413
01:34:09.519 --> 01:34:12.522
It's all right.
Don't panic. It's only me.

1414
01:34:13.774 --> 01:34:15.275
Emma. Emma Morley.

1415
01:34:15.442 --> 01:34:16.943
Yes. Hello.

1416
01:34:17.694 --> 01:34:20.322
So what do you suggest we do?

1417
01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:24.368
We could stay in touch.

1418
01:34:24.451 --> 01:34:27.496
Today. We're meant
to be doing something today.

1419
01:34:29.164 --> 01:34:30.749
Right. Right, right.

1420
01:34:30.832 --> 01:34:34.920
Look, today's a bit
tricky for me, really.

1421
01:34:35.003 --> 01:34:37.547
No, no, it's not that.
It's just...

1422
01:34:37.631 --> 01:34:39.776
Well, I'm meeting my parents,
and then I've
got to get back...

1423
01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:42.552
Oh, yeah, yeah,
you should probably go then.

1424
01:34:45.555 --> 01:34:48.016
It was lovely to meet you.
Bye, now.

1425
01:34:55.148 --> 01:35:00.237
Look, that's not until later,
so if you wanted to,

1426
01:35:01.863 --> 01:35:04.408
we could go for
a walk or something?

1427
01:35:08.203 --> 01:35:09.329
Okay.

1428
01:35:22.843 --> 01:35:24.928
Come on, keep up.

1429
01:35:25.011 --> 01:35:29.015
It's these shoes.
I can't mountain climb
in brogues.

1430
01:35:29.099 --> 01:35:33.353
It's not K2. It's just
a big hill, all right?
A child could do it.

1431
01:35:38.150 --> 01:35:42.195
I don't want you thinking
I'm bothered or anything
about last night.

1432
01:35:42.279 --> 01:35:46.283
I don't want
your phone number,
or letters, or postcards.

1433
01:35:46.366 --> 01:35:48.118
I don't want to
get married to you.

1434
01:35:48.201 --> 01:35:50.620
Definitely don't want
to have your babies.

1435
01:35:50.704 --> 01:35:53.540
Whatever happens tomorrow,
we've had today.

1436
01:35:59.546 --> 01:36:02.340
And if we should
bump into each other
sometime in the future,

1437
01:36:02.424 --> 01:36:04.342
well, that's fine, too.

1438
01:36:05.552 --> 01:36:07.387
We'll be friends.

1439
01:36:07.554 --> 01:36:09.431
Yeah, right.

1440
01:36:15.729 --> 01:36:18.857
Or, you know,
on the other hand...

1441
01:36:21.318 --> 01:36:22.569
Go on.

1442
01:36:24.404 --> 01:36:27.240
Well, my parents
don't arrive until later.

1443
01:36:28.950 --> 01:36:30.285
So?

1444
01:36:30.368 --> 01:36:33.622
So, well,
the flat's empty.

1445
01:36:35.207 --> 01:36:38.585
You know, if you wanted
to finish what we started.

1446
01:36:40.128 --> 01:36:41.838
What? Sober?

1447
01:36:42.214 --> 01:36:43.423
Mmm-hmm.

1448
01:36:44.591 --> 01:36:46.259
And in daylight.

1449
01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:51.681
Race you!

1450
01:37:06.988 --> 01:37:10.033
Do you want a piggy-back,
you old man?

1451
01:37:10.116 --> 01:37:14.120
It's these shoes.
There's no blooming
grip on these things.

1452
01:37:14.204 --> 01:37:15.997
Here, come here, you.

1453
01:37:20.585 --> 01:37:21.785
Did you come up
here with Emma?

1454
01:37:21.878 --> 01:37:23.046
Yeah, once.

1455
01:37:23.129 --> 01:37:25.340
That was
a long time ago now.

1456
01:37:26.466 --> 01:37:27.884
Do you miss her?

1457
01:37:28.009 --> 01:37:29.427
Well, of course, I do.

1458
01:37:30.595 --> 01:37:34.140
She was...
She was my best friend.

1459
01:37:34.224 --> 01:37:36.268
Who's your best
friend now then?

1460
01:37:36.351 --> 01:37:39.354
Well, you are, of course.
Come here.

1461
01:37:40.564 --> 01:37:42.190
Why, who's yours?

1462
01:37:43.441 --> 01:37:45.777
I think it's probably Mum.

1463
01:37:49.656 --> 01:37:50.740
Yeah.

1464
01:37:52.951 --> 01:37:54.786
I'm not so
terrible though, am I?

1465
01:37:54.911 --> 01:37:56.746
I'm not answering that.

1466
01:38:01.167 --> 01:38:03.044
You know what you are.

1467
01:38:29.487 --> 01:38:32.032
It's just round the corner.
This way.

1468
01:38:33.199 --> 01:38:34.284
Oh, Dexter!

1469
01:38:34.367 --> 01:38:36.161
Damn it, they're early.

1470
01:38:38.371 --> 01:38:39.623
You're early.

1471
01:38:39.706 --> 01:38:41.958
We thought we'd surprise you.

1472
01:38:42.042 --> 01:38:43.710
Clearly, we have.

1473
01:38:45.837 --> 01:38:48.256
Mum, Dad, this is Emma Morley.
Morley.

1474
01:38:48.340 --> 01:38:49.633
Hello.
Pleased to meet you.

1475
01:38:49.716 --> 01:38:51.843
Emma, you'll join us
for tea, yes?

1476
01:38:51.927 --> 01:38:55.138
No, no, thanks.
I should leave you to it.

1477
01:38:55.221 --> 01:38:57.724
Are you going to go?
Yeah. Well,

1478
01:38:57.849 --> 01:39:00.352
pleasure to meet you and...

1479
01:39:00.435 --> 01:39:02.854
Well, have a nice life.

1480
01:39:02.938 --> 01:39:04.105
Okay.

1481
01:39:10.111 --> 01:39:12.989
I'm sorry. Did we
just interrupt something?

1482
01:39:13.073 --> 01:39:16.910
No, no.
Emma's just a good friend.

1483
01:39:18.119 --> 01:39:19.704
Weren't you
wearing this yesterday?

1484
01:39:20.413 --> 01:39:21.748
The rascal.

1485
01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:29.089
Emma! Em!

1486
01:39:29.172 --> 01:39:31.925
Em, wait! Wait, wait.

1487
01:39:33.510 --> 01:39:36.554
Look,
I need your phone number.

1488
01:39:36.638 --> 01:39:39.975
My number?
Right. Of course.

1489
01:39:40.058 --> 01:39:41.559
Look, I'm so sorry
about all of that.

1490
01:39:41.643 --> 01:39:45.271
I wasn't expecting
them until after we...
Well, you know.

1491
01:39:46.564 --> 01:39:47.774
Right.

1492
01:39:48.650 --> 01:39:49.943
This is me in Edinburgh.

1493
01:39:50.068 --> 01:39:51.319
Right.

1494
01:39:52.278 --> 01:39:54.030
My parents' number

1495
01:39:55.198 --> 01:39:57.325
and their address
just in case.

1496
01:39:57.409 --> 01:39:58.702
Right.

1497
01:39:59.285 --> 01:40:01.162
Oh. Dad's got
a fax machine at work.

1498
01:40:01.246 --> 01:40:03.915
Just the phone number's fine.

1499
01:40:03.999 --> 01:40:05.250
Thank you.

1500
01:40:36.364 --> 01:40:37.449
Look, I've got to go.

1501
01:40:37.532 --> 01:40:38.616
I know.

1502
01:40:41.327 --> 01:40:42.829
But we will see
each other again.

1503
01:40:42.996 --> 01:40:44.497
I know we will.

1504
01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:48.293
Goodbye, Dex.

1505
01:40:48.626 --> 01:40:49.919
Goodbye.

1506
01:40:51.212 --> 01:40:52.464
Goodbye.
