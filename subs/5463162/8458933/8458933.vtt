make it to two.

01:14:26.399 --> 01:14:27.775
WEASEL.: It's like, um...
Here we go.

1405
01:14:27.858 --> 01:14:29.067
It's like he was
giving birth anally,

1406
01:14:29.151 --> 01:14:30.777
but they quit
halfway through.

1407
01:14:30.861 --> 01:14:32.028
They got the legs out,
and they said,

1408
01:14:32.113 --> 01:14:33.239
"You know what, I'm done."

1409
01:14:33.322 --> 01:14:34.323
Happy?

1410
01:14:34.407 --> 01:14:35.449
It's like he's a Muppet
from the waist down.

1411
01:14:35.533 --> 01:14:36.909
But this time, you can see

1412
01:14:36.993 --> 01:14:38.411
the Muppet's dick.
(DOOR OPENS)

1413
01:14:38.494 --> 01:14:39.536
Grover's got a cock
the size of a twig.

1414
01:14:39.620 --> 01:14:40.996
DOPINDER: Mr. Weasel, I can
no longer be double-parked.

1415
01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:42.706
I've had three tickets
already. (SCREAMS)

1416
01:14:44.375 --> 01:14:46.835
No, no, no, DP,
not again!

1417
01:14:46.919 --> 01:14:48.837
This has happened before?
(DOPINDER RETCHING)

1418
01:14:49.839 --> 01:14:51.257
(DOOR OPENS) Jesus!
Either vomit or don't.

1419
01:14:51.340 --> 01:14:52.549
The indecision
is killing me.

1420
01:14:52.717 --> 01:14:54.593
Why couldn't God
take my hearing?

1421
01:14:56.178 --> 01:14:58.263
Oh. Wow!

1422
01:14:58.347 --> 01:14:59.890
Cool your pits.
They're growing back.

1423
01:15:00.141 --> 01:15:01.684
I'm talking about your face.

1424
01:15:02.143 --> 01:15:03.936
I've never seen you
without your mask before.

1425
01:15:04.061 --> 01:15:06.146
Jesus Christ!
Looks like an avocado.

1426
01:15:06.230 --> 01:15:07.940
DOMINO: Your legs, though,
they're cute.

1427
01:15:08.274 --> 01:15:10.067
You wanna borrow
a pair of pants?

1428
01:15:11.652 --> 01:15:13.111
I'm glad
everybody dropped by.

1429
01:15:13.279 --> 01:15:15.572
You must be wondering
why I didn't call you here.

1430
01:15:16.032 --> 01:15:17.658
I'll tell you
why I'm here.

1431
01:15:17.825 --> 01:15:19.952
"The Time Traveler's Wife's"
husband...

1432
01:15:20.036 --> 01:15:21.287
beat me within
an inch of my life.

1433
01:15:21.370 --> 01:15:22.579
He was torturing me!

1434
01:15:22.663 --> 01:15:25.499
But all I told him was
everything he wanted to know.

1435
01:15:25.791 --> 01:15:27.834
So, I'm here
to help us gear up.

1436
01:15:28.294 --> 01:15:29.461
So we can go after him
without me.

1437
01:15:29.545 --> 01:15:30.546
WADE: No!

1438
01:15:31.088 --> 01:15:32.297
I'm doing this alone.

1439
01:15:32.381 --> 01:15:33.382
The Juggernaut

1440
01:15:33.466 --> 01:15:34.842
will kill you all.
Fair enough.

1441
01:15:34.925 --> 01:15:36.384
WADE: I just need a couple of
hours to get some legs

1442
01:15:36.469 --> 01:15:37.970
under me.
What will you do?

1443
01:15:38.054 --> 01:15:39.388
WADE: I don't care
what the kid did to me.

1444
01:15:39.472 --> 01:15:40.764
I ain't letting Cable
get to him,

1445
01:15:40.848 --> 01:15:42.140
even if I have to
teabag him to death.

1446
01:15:42.224 --> 01:15:44.226
It's really just a sip
of tea at this point.

1447
01:15:44.310 --> 01:15:46.061
Zip it, black Black Widow!
I'm flowing.

1448
01:15:46.145 --> 01:15:47.146
The first order
of business is

1449
01:15:47.229 --> 01:15:48.230
to get me
in front of Cable...

1450
01:15:48.314 --> 01:15:50.107
so I can pull all the fucking
blood out of his body...

1451
01:15:50.191 --> 01:15:52.359
and fashion his bones
into holiday jewelry.

1452
01:15:52.610 --> 01:15:54.278
Then,
I'm gonna take his skin...

1453
01:15:54.361 --> 01:15:57.447
and stretch it out
over a homemade mating drum.

1454
01:15:59.116 --> 01:16:00.617
He's standing
right behind you, isn't he?

1455
01:16:04.205 --> 01:16:05.206
(COCKS GUN)

1456
01:16:09.376 --> 01:16:11.044
What in the ass?

1457
01:16:11.253 --> 01:16:14.339
Is this apartment listed
on Tinder? Grindr?

1458
01:16:14.715 --> 01:16:16.967
You picked the wrong shithole
to fuck, future boy.

1459
01:16:17.468 --> 01:16:20.304
Ugh. Is that really necessary?

1460
01:16:22.598 --> 01:16:25.350
No. It's his "Basic Instinct."

1461
01:16:25.434 --> 01:16:26.476
What can we help you with?

1462
01:16:27.269 --> 01:16:28.895
I'm here to proposition you.

1463
01:16:29.772 --> 01:16:31.398
(LAUGHS) Oh, boy!

1464
01:16:31.482 --> 01:16:32.524
He's really teeing it up,
isn't he?

1465
01:16:32.608 --> 01:16:34.693
Who gets to make
the first joke?

1466
01:16:34.819 --> 01:16:36.028
I think we should all
do it at the same time.

1467
01:16:36.112 --> 01:16:37.113
Good call.

1468
01:16:37.196 --> 01:16:38.780
For $45,
you get sucky-suck.

1469
01:16:38.864 --> 01:16:40.156
BOTH: I only do over
the pants, mouth stuff.

1470
01:16:40.241 --> 01:16:41.242
Fuck!

1471
01:16:41.325 --> 01:16:42.367
The Proposition
has a wonderful

1472
01:16:42.451 --> 01:16:43.452
Guy Pearce performance.

1473
01:16:43.536 --> 01:16:45.246
WADE: Wait, wait, wait!
I wanna do mine over.

1474
01:16:45.621 --> 01:16:47.664
Give us the line again.
I need your help!

1475
01:16:48.249 --> 01:16:50.459
Trust me, I'm even less happy
about this than you are...

1476
01:16:50.543 --> 01:16:53.170
but you unleashed the
Juggernaut, you dumb cunt!

1477
01:16:53.796 --> 01:16:56.006
I can't
bring him down alone.

1478
01:16:56.090 --> 01:16:57.674
So here we are.

1479
01:16:59.093 --> 01:17:00.844
We're no longer
accepting applications

1480
01:17:00.928 --> 01:17:02.220
for X-Force, unfortunately.

1481
01:17:02.388 --> 01:17:03.722
Even if we were...

1482
01:17:03.889 --> 01:17:05.515
there's a wind advisory
in effect until at least...

1483
01:17:05.599 --> 01:17:06.766
We don't have
a lot of time.

1484
01:17:06.851 --> 01:17:08.561
Your friend's about
to make his first kill.

1485
01:17:08.644 --> 01:17:10.187
No offense,
but if you know so much...

1486
01:17:10.271 --> 01:17:12.606
why not travel back to when
he was a baby, kill him then?

1487
01:17:13.190 --> 01:17:14.191
Or better yet, head back
a little further,

1488
01:17:14.275 --> 01:17:15.276
kill baby Hitler.

1489
01:17:15.359 --> 01:17:17.235
I use a device
to slide through time.

1490
01:17:17.403 --> 01:17:19.947
The longer I travel,
the harder it is to control.

1491
01:17:20.114 --> 01:17:22.574
I got two charges:
one to get me here,

1492
01:17:22.658 --> 01:17:23.784
one to get me home.

1493
01:17:23.868 --> 01:17:25.119
Well.

1494
01:17:25.202 --> 01:17:26.995
That's just lazy writing.

1495
01:17:27.079 --> 01:17:28.371
Your boy's
gonna kill the headmaster

1496
01:17:28.455 --> 01:17:29.914
of the orphanage tonight.

1497
01:17:29.999 --> 01:17:32.042
After that,
he gets a real taste for it.

1498
01:17:32.251 --> 01:17:34.878
Like 10-year-old
Kirsten Dunst, motherfucker!

1499
01:17:35.045 --> 01:17:36.838
So he keeps killing...

1500
01:17:37.006 --> 01:17:38.340
and killing, and killing,

1501
01:17:38.424 --> 01:17:39.758
and killing.
(GUNS COCKING)

1502
01:17:40.092 --> 01:17:43.303
Until one day, he kills
the wrong fucking people.

1503
01:17:45.890 --> 01:17:47.266
My people.

1504
01:17:51.187 --> 01:17:52.271
Relax.

1505
01:17:52.354 --> 01:17:54.731
I'm retrieving something
from my utility bag.

1506
01:17:54.940 --> 01:17:57.442
It's a goddamn fanny pack...

1507
01:17:57.526 --> 01:17:59.986
and you know it,
you sick son of a bitch!

1508
01:18:00.196 --> 01:18:01.864
The difference
is night and day.

1509
01:18:03.657 --> 01:18:05.784
You remind me of my wife.

1510
01:18:06.118 --> 01:18:07.119
I'm sorry.

1511
01:18:07.494 --> 01:18:08.995
I said, "You remind me
of my wife."

1512
01:18:09.079 --> 01:18:10.080
No, I'm sorry
that you said that...

1513
01:18:10.164 --> 01:18:12.791
while making heavy eye contact
and applying lip balm.

1514
01:18:12.875 --> 01:18:14.042
CABLE: She always struggled.

1515
01:18:15.252 --> 01:18:16.586
But she was funny...

1516
01:18:16.837 --> 01:18:19.172
and filtered her pain
through the prism of humor.

1517
01:18:20.132 --> 01:18:22.259
Something I could
never master.

1518
01:18:23.093 --> 01:18:25.303
It was my fault she died.

1519
01:18:27.097 --> 01:18:29.766
It was my job
to stop people like him.

1520
01:18:30.809 --> 01:18:32.727
I came close a few times.
(TOMORROW PLAYING)

1521
01:18:36.941 --> 01:18:38.609
He wasn't too happy
about that.

1522
01:18:40.319 --> 01:18:41.403
He was trying to hurt me...

1523
01:18:41.528 --> 01:18:43.863
and he knew exactly
how to do it.

1524
01:18:47.618 --> 01:18:49.286
OLDER RUSSELL:
Blessed are the wicked

1525
01:18:49.370 --> 01:18:50.829
who are healed by my hand.

1526
01:18:54.041 --> 01:18:55.375
CABLE: He came into my home...

1527
01:18:56.418 --> 01:18:59.295
and took the only thing
that made it a home.

1528
01:19:03.384 --> 01:19:04.760
Sound familiar?

1529
01:19:05.928 --> 01:19:07.512
I'm sorry.
Uh-huh.

1530
01:19:07.596 --> 01:19:09.264
No, I'm really sorry.

1531
01:19:11.475 --> 01:19:13.518
But that isn't Russell.

1532
01:19:13.602 --> 01:19:15.562
It doesn't have to be him.
If you knew what I knew...

1533
01:19:15.646 --> 01:19:17.481
Yeah, he's got anger issues...

1534
01:19:17.564 --> 01:19:19.148
maybe a small
learning disability...

1535
01:19:19.233 --> 01:19:20.525
splash of diabetes...

1536
01:19:20.693 --> 01:19:21.985
but nothing
that can't be fixed.

1537
01:19:22.069 --> 01:19:23.612
If you could go back...

1538
01:19:23.779 --> 01:19:26.448
and stop the people that took
your girl, would you?

1539
01:19:26.615 --> 01:19:28.366
Of course I fucking would!

1540
01:19:29.118 --> 01:19:30.786
But I wouldn't kill a kid.

1541
01:19:30.911 --> 01:19:32.287
I'm not asking you
to Kill a kid!

1542
01:19:32.371 --> 01:19:33.663
I'll kill the kid.

1543
01:19:33.831 --> 01:19:37.209
I'm asking you to save
hundreds of other kids.

1544
01:19:37.376 --> 01:19:39.586
Russell's gonna burn down
that orphanage.

1545
01:19:39.753 --> 01:19:41.671
And I can imagine
your dead girlfriend...

1546
01:19:41.839 --> 01:19:44.258
would want you to do the
right thing, wouldn't she?

1547
01:19:45.092 --> 01:19:47.677
So, what's it gonna be,
handsome?

1548
01:19:48.345 --> 01:19:49.929
Give me a chance
to save him.

1549
01:19:50.097 --> 01:19:51.431
What?
You said...

1550
01:19:51.598 --> 01:19:53.266
once he kills someone,
he gets a taste for it.

1551
01:19:53.350 --> 01:19:55.602
If we can get to him
before that happens...

1552
01:19:55.686 --> 01:19:57.270
promise you'll give me
a chance

1553
01:19:57.354 --> 01:19:59.064
to put him
on a different path.

1554
01:19:59.231 --> 01:20:00.398
Define "chance."

1555
01:20:00.566 --> 01:20:01.650
I don't know.
How long does it take

1556
01:20:01.734 --> 01:20:03.026
to save someone's soul?
That's not...

1557
01:20:03.110 --> 01:20:04.361
I'll give you 30 seconds.

1558
01:20:04.528 --> 01:20:06.446
What? No!
Best I can do.

1559
01:20:06.530 --> 01:20:07.822
Take it or leave it.

01:48:50.419 --> 01:48:52.963
No, you're X-People.

2097
01:48:53.130 --> 01:48:54.297
You're exhausting.

2098
01:48:54.590 --> 01:48:56.425
I see what you did there.
Puns.

2099
01:48:56.967 --> 01:48:59.177
Bye, Wade!
Bye, Yukio!

2100
01:48:59.344 --> 01:49:00.345
(WE BELONG PLAYING)

2101
01:49:01.722 --> 01:49:02.764
DEADPOOL: What do you get

2102
01:49:02.848 --> 01:49:03.932
when you take
eight feet of chrome...

2103
01:49:04.016 --> 01:49:05.058
one pinch of courage...

2104
01:49:05.225 --> 01:49:06.351
a cup of good luck...

2105
01:49:06.518 --> 01:49:07.936
a dab of racism...

2106
01:49:08.103 --> 01:49:09.187
a splash of diabetes...

2107
01:49:09.354 --> 01:49:11.689
and a wheelbarrow
full of stage four cancer?

2108
01:49:12.107 --> 01:49:14.275
Answer: a family.

2109
01:49:14.860 --> 01:49:17.863
See? I didn't lie
what kind of film this was.

2110
01:49:18.030 --> 01:49:19.322
If there's anything
you take away today...

2111
01:49:19.406 --> 01:49:22.450
other than the need to Google,
"What the fuck is dubstep?”...

2112
01:49:22.534 --> 01:49:25.328
it's that we all need
to belong to someone.

2113
01:51:22.529 --> 01:51:24.280
How something
so small generates

2114
01:51:24.364 --> 01:51:26.199
enough energy
to reverse time is--

2115
01:51:26.283 --> 01:51:28.243
Oh, just fix it, Eleven,

2116
01:51:28.327 --> 01:51:30.370
or I'll take it
to the Genius Bar.

2117
01:51:30.621 --> 01:51:31.788
Cable's gonna kill you
when he finds out.

2118
01:51:31.872 --> 01:51:32.873
Never heard of him.

2119
01:51:32.956 --> 01:51:34.415
Why do you think
I'm helping him?

2120
01:51:35.709 --> 01:51:37.919
The Lord works
in mysterious ways,

2121
01:51:38.003 --> 01:51:40.005
don't I? A good day.

2122
01:51:40.964 --> 01:51:41.965
Bye, Wade!

2123
01:51:42.466 --> 01:51:43.467
Bye, Yukio!

2124
01:51:44.801 --> 01:51:47.011
That was probably a bad idea.

2125
01:51:47.346 --> 01:51:48.472
What have we done?

2126
01:51:49.264 --> 01:51:51.266
(IF I COULD TURN BACK TIME
PLAYING)

2127
01:52:06.865 --> 01:52:08.741
I hope we sharpened
the cream cheese spreader.

(BOTH PANTING)
(GASPS)

2129
01:52:19.086 --> 01:52:20.545
I'll be right back!

2130
01:52:22.506 --> 01:52:25.050
We're definitely naming
our kid Cher!

2131
01:52:25.425 --> 01:52:26.426
Whoo!

2132
01:52:28.262 --> 01:52:29.513
DEADPOOL: Peter!

2133
01:52:29.680 --> 01:52:31.056
Whoo! X-Force!

2134
01:52:31.265 --> 01:52:33.475
Walk away! Just walk away!

2135
01:52:34.309 --> 01:52:35.518
But we're X-Force!

2136
01:52:35.602 --> 01:52:37.061
Nope! We're not,
there's no X-Force!

2137
01:52:37.312 --> 01:52:40.148
All right, well,
this has been pretty scary!

2138
01:52:40.732 --> 01:52:42.984
Go home, Sugarbear.
Go home.

2139
01:52:43.610 --> 01:52:46.195
Okay. Will you give
Domino my email?

2140
01:52:55.414 --> 01:52:57.207
Wade, is that you?

2141
01:52:59.543 --> 01:53:00.877
I guess Stryker finally

2142
01:53:00.961 --> 01:53:02.253
figured out
how to shut you up.

2144

Hey! It's me!
Don't scratch!

2145
01:53:12.180 --> 01:53:14.098

the timelines!
