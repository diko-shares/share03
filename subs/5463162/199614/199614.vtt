1
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:14,005
Since time began...

2
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:16,075
a war has been waged
in the shadows...

3
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:19,304
between the armies
of Good and Evil.

4
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,781
It may be fought
on a grand scale...

5
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:26,875
or within the heart
of a single individual...

6
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:29,113
or even a child.

7
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:33,548
The Evil has taken many forms...

8
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:37,528
and used the darkest of arts.

9
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,122
In our time,
they call themselves simply...

10
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:43,134
the Hand.

11
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:46,865
The Good follow
the way of kimagure.

12
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:49,203
Its masters can see the future...

13
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:53,438
and perhaps even
bring back the dead.

14
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,344
Legend tells of
a unique warrior...

15
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,679
a lost soul.

16
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,117
This warrior is a woman...

17
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:03,121
a motherless daughter.

18
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:08,627
And it is her destiny to tip the balance
between Good and Evil.

19
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:12,721
She is a treasure,
and both sides seek her out...

20
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:16,324
as a final weapon
in an ancient war.

21
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:30,580
- Perimeter, what's your status?
- Delta team, clear.

22
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:33,481
- Alpha, clear.
- Bravo, secure.

23
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:35,884
It doesn't matter.

24
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,390
You can't stop her.

25
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,485
- Nobody can stop her.
- Her?

26
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:48,961
I was afraid if I told you,
you wouldn't take the job.

27
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:50,968
I never should've hired you.

28
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:59,411
Who do you think's coming for you?

29
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:02,140
You may have heard of her.
Her name...

30
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,583
is Elektra.

31
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:11,118
- You find that funny?
- She's an urban legend, sir.

32
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:13,158
That woman died years ago.

33
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:18,060
Really? Well, then somebody
must have brought her back from the dead.

34
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:21,361
You know, Bauer, when you've
done the things I've done...

35
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,833
you make a lot of enemies.

36
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:28,965
My private security detail...
the best money could buy.

37
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:33,511
This nonexistent woman
killed 14 of them in half an hour.

38
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:35,513
I barely got away.

39
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:40,643
Spent the next two days in Monte Carlo
wondering why she let me go.

40
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:42,948
Then she came for me.

41
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:47,220
I was under the protection
of the Hand itself, who sent their best.

42
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:50,888
Although they seemed more interested
in killing Elektra than in protecting me.

43
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:55,399
She cut 'em down like wheat.

44
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:58,231
Took maybe 10, 15 minutes max.

45
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:03,173
Didn't really think
why I kept gettin' away.

46
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:05,675
So here I am.

47
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:07,678
And now I understand her.

48
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,549
She wanted me to feel this...

49
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:14,848
what it's like
to have nowhere to go...

50
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:17,013
nowhere to turn.

51
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,792
How's your perimeter doing now?

52
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:31,199
Delta, what's your status?

53
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:33,499
There's no signal.
Son of a bitch.

54
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,871
- You know, the better the assassin...
- Alpha, Bravo, report.!

55
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,978
The closer they can get to you
before you know they're there.

56
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,706
Alpha! Bravo! Report!

57
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,009
- Ah, Christ.

58
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:49,916
They say Elektra whispers in your ear
before she kills you.

59
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:53,356
- Alpha.! Bravo.! Report.!
- It's too late for your boss, Bauer.

60
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,359
- But you still have a chance.
- Jesus Christ!

61
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:31,128
You can't fight a ghost, Bauer.

62
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:08,297
- Here we are at last.

63
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,471
Guess it's all true.

64
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:15,973
The red outfit
and the knives and...

65
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,410
So, what happens now?

66
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:22,140
You just kill me,
straight out? Just cold?

67
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:25,341
Don't worry.
Death's not that bad.

68
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:27,646
Yeah? How do you know?

69
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,925
I died once.

70
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:08,594
So am I to understand that
with all the power of the Hand...

71
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:10,423
that the Treasure
continues to elude us?

72
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,966
Yes. Perhaps if we
had pursued it sooner...

73
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:15,966
and more aggressively...

74
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:18,696
You dare to blame
Master Roshi?

75
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:21,433
Seems our methods
are too mild for Kirigi.

76
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,441
Not at all, sensei.

77
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:25,703
But if we cannot have
the weapon ourselves...

78
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:30,305
allow me to make sure it does not fall into
the hands of those who may use it against us.

79
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,509
Master, allow me.

80
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:36,179
Things like this must be handled
smoothly, quietly.

81
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,486
Then work smoothly, Meizumi,
but quickly.

82
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:53,597
Kirigi?

83
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:56,266
Yes, Father.

84
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:58,377
Patience.

85
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,948
You think that's safe,
leaving the door unlocked like that?

86
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,281
Geez, Elektra, you're gonna end up
with a bullet in your head.

87
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,788
I brought you a little something.

88
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,451
No, stop, McCabe. Don't put it down.
I already cleaned there.

89
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,928
- Why do you always do this?
- Get rid of my D.N.A.

90
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:30,400
Ah, D.N.A., of course. Right.

91
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:33,961
Silly of me. Listen, I just picked this up.
I know you like to look.

92
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,836
- It's all there?
- Less my 10%.

93
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:49,112
- Half to Barbados?
- And half to the bank on the Isle of Man.

94
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:51,712
You can do better in mutual funds.
I know a guy. I could put you in touch...

95
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:54,657
- No, thanks.
- Or not. But...

96
00:09:57,063 --> 00:10:00,191
Look, I don't want
to tell you how to do your thing...

97
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:03,462
but quite a body count
on this one, E.

98
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,599
We were only getting paid
for DeMarco.

99
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:13,211
Was it necessary?

100
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:18,781
Had to be done.

101
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:21,114
Did it?

102
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,915
Elektra.

103
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,150
Did it?

104
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,998
Okay.

105
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,793
Anyway, it spreads the legend.

106
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:38,733
Besides, they were gonna kill me.

107
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:41,238
Of course they were.
Absolutely.

108
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,604
And, speaking of which,
as your agent...

109
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:47,042
I am obligated to tell you we just got
an absolutely fantastic new offer...

110
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:50,309
- but that last job...
- Let's skip this one. I need a breather.

111
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,817
- Great idea. I'm just sayin' it's a lot of coin.
- I'm tired.

112
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,353
You're tired?
Well, then you better get yourself some sleep...

113
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:58,548
'cause you are gonna crash,
baby, you know that.

114
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,626
I mean, you even get laid?

115
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,896
It's a lot of money,
this new offer.

116
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,129
- McCabe.
- All right, fine. You know what?

117
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:16,174
Look, you want to take time off, take time off.
Call me when you wanna work.

118
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:19,234
How much?
And just tell me.

119
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:22,472
Two.

120
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,981
Ah, they'll give it to somebody else.

121
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,712
They wouldn't pay that
to somebody else.

122
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,720
You got that right.

123
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,858
They asked specifically for you.

124
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,761
Location's in there.
I'll call you when I get the target.

125
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,767
Get some sleep.

126
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,133
You might wanna reflect a bit.

127
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,882
- Again!

128
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:04,783
Do you know the way, Elektra?

129
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:12,994
Kimagure, the ability to control time...

130
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:15,329
the future...

131
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:17,664
even life and death.

132
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,863
I know I'm the best student here.

133
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:24,875
Not the best.
The most powerful.

134
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:32,909
You understand violence and pain.

135
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,089
But you do not know the way.

136
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,692
- Teach me then.
- That's my point.

137
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:42,693
I can't teach you.

138
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:47,227
I want you to go.

139
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,233
Is this a test, sensei?

140
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:52,304
No, not a test.

141
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:56,197
Just go.

142
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,642
I don't have anywhere to go.

143
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:40,614
The client says
he needs you there a couple days early...

144
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:42,619
says that's part of the deal.

145
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:44,780
- Why?
- No idea.

146
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,358
- He just wants you to wait.
- I just want to get this over with.

147
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,757
Hey, me too. Listen, why don't you
tell me about the view?

148
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:52,023
I hear it's gorgeous out there.
You know, you got the...

149
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:59,169
One, two, three, four, five.

150
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,832
- Come on, Elektra. Keep pedaling.

151
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,907
Five more minutes.

152
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:45,568
Don't use your hands.
Don't be lazy. Only use your feet.

153
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,611
Let's go!
Let's push, push, push, push!

154
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:51,706
Nikolas. Honey, please.
She's just a kid.

155
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,715
Keep going, Elektra.

156
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,380
Keep going.

157
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:08,588
Jesus! What's the matter with you?
You could have killed me!

158
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,594
What are you doing here?

159
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,563
Nothing. I'm friends
with the Wheelwrights.

160
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:16,964
Damn it. You cut my friggin' jacket.

161
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:22,362
- How did you get in?
- The front door was unlocked.

162
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:26,376
- No, it wasn't.
- Yeah, it was.

163
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:30,209
Look, the people who live here
let me come in all the time. Ask anybody.

164
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:35,782
Hmm. It's broken.

165
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,081
- So, who are you anyways? My name's Abby.
- What'd you steal?

166
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,922
Nothing.
What do you think I am?

167
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:44,928
Ow!

168
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,330
Please don't call the cops.

169
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,340
My dad will kill me.

170
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:59,103
In some parts of the world,
they just cut your hands off.

171
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,281
Whoa.

172
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:08,518
How did you do that?

173
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,918
Get out of here.

174
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:34,578
Mom?

175
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:20,516
Oh, shit.

176
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:25,318
You know I can't sit still, McCabe.
Call me with the name.

177
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:28,222
Client says he needs you there
a couple days early. Wants you to wait.

178
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:30,591
- To have nowhere to go...
- Death's not that bad.

179
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:33,665
- nowhere to turn.
- He wants you to wait.

180
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:36,325
- You just kill me, straight out?
- He wants you to wait.

181
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:01,722
Are you looking for me?

182
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:05,128
Hi.

183
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,069
Are you the new, uh, tenant?

184
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:14,366
Eddie Ferris, the Realtor... he said, uh,
a young woman had taken it for the month.

185
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,771
What do you want?

186
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:18,967
Sorry. This is
kind of awkward, but, uh...

187
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:23,070
have you seen a girl...
13-year-old, uh, blondish hair to about here?

188
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:25,945
My daughter, Abby.

189
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:28,246
- We had a fight yesterday...
- I saw her late afternoon.

190
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:31,379
- Oh, you did?
- She broke into my house.

191
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:36,217
Shit. Really?

192
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:38,421
Uh, she knows
the Wheelwrights, who, uh...

193
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,863
She, uh, didn't
take anything, did she?

194
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,935
- No.
- Good.

195
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:49,900
Look, if she broke something,
I'm... I'm happy to pay for it. I'm Mark Miller.

196
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:52,704
We're in the little cabin
two houses down.

197
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:58,308
Okay, thanks.

198
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:07,848
Hi, you've reached McCabe.
But please leave just your name.

199
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:11,759
- Do not leave a message.
- McCabe...

200
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:14,923
I'm sick of sitting here.

201
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:17,058
We don't get a name soon,
I'm walking.

202
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,643
Hey.

203
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:34,651
How long have you
been standing there?

204
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:38,018
Like, a minute.

205
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:40,990
What did you tell my dad?

206
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:43,254
Did you tell him
I broke into your house?

207
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:46,695
- Yeah, because you did break in.
- Well, you didn't have to tell him.

208
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:48,698
I thought you were cool.

209
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,961
- I'm not.
- Yeah, no kidding.

210
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:54,368
Now he's on my case. He made me come
ask you to have Christmas dinner with us.

211
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:58,341
- Have what?
- Christmas?

212
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:00,377
Dinner? December 25?

213
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:04,915
Did you know today's Christmas?

214
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:07,450
Thank you. I can't.
I have something to do.

215
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:10,419
What? Everything's closed.

216
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:13,082
You're on an island.

217
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:15,819
Come on. Please?

218
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:17,861
It's just
the two of us every night...

219
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:20,329
and I'm bored out of my skull.

220
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,665
What are you doing?

221
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:31,140
Nothing. Why?

222
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:35,476
- Were you counting?
- No.

223
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,077
So, will you come? Please?

224
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:45,179
Because if you don't, I'll just keep
breaking into your house. Hmm?

225
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:49,358
Hmm. I have to
change my clothes.

226
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:51,986
Great!

227
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,429
I'm Abby.

228
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:58,561
Elektra.

229
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:01,002
Elektra. Cool.

230
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:10,213
I told you not to leave the house.

231
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:13,216
- You didn't even know I was gone.
- Abby.

232
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:16,219
Chill, Dad.
We have a guest.

233
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:26,892
I'm sorry.
She told me that you'd invited me.

234
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:29,831
I don't want to...

235
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:32,165
- I'll just...
- Hmm. Uh-uh.

236
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:35,000
- No. Please, stay.

237
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:37,006
I'm... I'm glad you're here.

238
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:46,406
Uh, can I get you a beer?
Wine?

239
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:49,384
Water.

240
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,683
Her name's Elektra, Dad.

241
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:56,493
- Elektra.

242
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:59,792
Like the tragedy.
Your parents must have had a sense of humor.

243
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:02,992
Not really.

244
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:11,731
So when she sees all the cute guys
who like me... just as friends, Dad...

245
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:15,870
she accidentally spills poster paint
all over my model of the Taj Mahal.

246
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,278
So I put glue on her shoes.

247
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:21,147
I got suspended for that,
and then I got expelled for fighting.

248
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:24,279
But that was way back
in the day in... in, um...

249
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:29,085
Baltimore.

250
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,958
So, I was a little surprised
to see you take the Wheelwright place.

251
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:34,293
Not many renters
this time of year.

252
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:36,299
It's just for the month, for work.

253
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:39,097
What do you do anyway?

254
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:42,662
Oh, layoffs, payroll reduction.

255
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:44,605
- That sort of thing.
- Hmm.

256
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:46,938
- Sounds boring.
- Abby.

257
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:50,514
No, it is boring.
I like your bracelet, by the way.

258
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:53,709
Do you know
what those are? Here.

259
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:56,378
They're warrior beads.
They're from Indonesia.

260
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:59,889
Centuries ago, you had to be the best fighter
in your village to earn them.

261
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:01,822
Wow.

262
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:06,156
I bought 'em off eBay.

263
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:10,066
Is there a school here
on the island?

264
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:13,262
Uh, we're trying home schooling
for a while.

265
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:16,135
I read at college level.
And I'm doing algebra one on my own.

266
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,799
She's a good student.

267
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:22,778
It's the, uh, behavioural stuff
that's been a problem.

268
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:25,213
I have authority issues,
and I don't take bullshit well.

269
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:28,013
- Don't speak in that...
- Hey, Abby!

270
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:33,257
It's okay.

271
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:36,085
Suddenly I got
a teenager on my hands.

272
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,456
- She's hard on herself.
- You can tell, huh?

273
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:47,289
- Most people think she's a slacker.
- No, I shouldn't.

274
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:50,300
Merry Christmas?

275
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,534
Where's her mother?

276
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,307
She died... a couple of years ago.

277
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:06,383
Back in Baltimore?

278
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:09,112
Yeah. Drunk driver.

279
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:17,893
My mother died when I was young.

280
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:20,430
I should go.

281
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,363
- I have work.
- Come on, it's early.

282
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:24,458
Thanks for dinner.

283
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:30,373
Hmm.

284
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,877
- What?

285
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:12,848
Good morning. You just got a delivery.

286
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:34,665
- It's a double.
- Which makes double the money.

287
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,139
Yeah, that's why the big bucks.

288
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:41,343
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

289
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,346
Good. Then there'll
be no problems.

290
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,386
I'll call you when it's done.

291
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:52,008
How's math going?

292
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:54,778
How do you think it's going?

293
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,332
What do you mean, you're not doing it?
Not now or not ever?

294
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:15,167
- Too many variables. Not enough background.
- Background?

295
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:17,764
E, they'll just send somebody else.

296
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:41,785
The storm we've been waiting...
all... finally here.

297
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:44,794
- It's moved into the Seattle-Tacoma area.
- I'll get sandbags from the shed.

298
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:49,697
You know, this is such a joke. They make it sound
all exciting, but you know it's just rain.

299
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:54,135
If you're not too busy, young lady,
feel free to tape the windows.

300
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:57,139
Now!

301
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:22,524
Mark.!

302
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:24,692
Can I talk to you?

303
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,140
Can we talk inside?

304
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:34,301
Yeah, sure.

305
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,805
Hey, what's up?

306
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:08,844
Can you go to your bedroom for a minute, Abby?
I need to talk to your dad.

307
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:10,937
Now!

308
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:12,982
Go, Abby.

309
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,922
- Who are you? Don't lie to me.
- What?

310
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:24,085
They wont just kill you.

311
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:26,755
They'll kill Abby.

312
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:30,265
- Damn it.!
- Dad!

313
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:32,199
Go!

314
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:34,794
Run, Abby!
Bathroom! Go! Go! Go!

315
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,873
- Stay with Abby!
- Okay.

316
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:50,019
[Gasps]

317
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:06,666
- Elektra!
- Abby!

318
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:53,911
- No!

319
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:55,918
Ohh!

320
00:35:57,855 --> 00:35:59,652
Damn it.

321
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:03,353
Get back!

322
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:05,088
Get back! Go!

323
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:06,993
Go.

324
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:13,769
There'll be more coming.

325
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:15,771
What's coming next
will be worse.

326
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:34,651
I believe Kirigi wishes to
address the Council of the Hand.

327
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:37,346
Venerable master...

328
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:40,618
despite your delicacy
and subtlety...

329
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:44,024
you have failed to solve
the problem of the Treasure.

330
00:37:44,128 --> 00:37:46,221
Huh!

331
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:49,299
Master Roshi gave that task to me.

332
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,233
- Yes, exactly.
- And my men are taking care of it.

333
00:37:52,336 --> 00:37:54,167
Your men are dead!

334
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,934
Killed by the female,
Elektra, the gaijin.

335
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:02,369
Bu...

336
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:16,450
Your forces are an abomination!

337
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,204
Master Roshi...

338
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:31,707
the Hand cannot afford to lose
the Treasure for another generation.

339
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:34,675
So I humbly request
you allow me this task.

340
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:36,838
Perhaps with
a little less delicacy...

341
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,882
my forces will not be
defeated by a mere woman.

342
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,043
The task is yours.

343
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:46,522
Complete it, and you will have proven
yourself worthy of leading this council.

344
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:51,085
I will step aside.

345
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:18,215
Oh, that's just great. The Hand.

346
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:21,086
Of all people.
So who's gonna help you out on this one, E?

347
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,092
- Stick?
- Just give me his location.

348
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,719
Sure, no problem.
I got it handled.

349
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,730
Goddamn it.

350
00:39:45,483 --> 00:39:47,417
You're up, blind man.

351
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:51,420
Double combo: Triple carom
on the four-three-two-one-six with a bank massé.

352
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:54,252
Uh, you don't need to call
all your shots, pops. Just the first one.

353
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:56,258
That is the first one.

354
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,025
Whoa, whoa.
Aw, you gotta be kidding me.

355
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,777
Eight ball in the corner.

356
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:28,083
- Blind, my ass.
- Leave your money on the table.

357
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:39,669
Here's a dollar, Abs.
Go play some pinball.

358
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:43,433
- Why do I always have to miss the good stuff?
- Just go.

359
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:52,082
Elektra. Same walk.

360
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:54,377
Same perfume.

361
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:56,316
They need your help.

362
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,320
Over here.

363
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:09,998
This is Mark Miller.

364
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,534
Mark and his daughter, Abby,
are being chased by the Hand...

365
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,365
and they need your protection.

366
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:17,202
I'm leaving them with you.
The Hand is your business, not mine.

367
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:21,141
And yet you saved their lives. Why?
What did you imagine would happen next?

368
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:23,645
I didn't really have time
to think about it.

369
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:25,715
Blind instinct.

370
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:28,910
Then you and I are back
where we started, Elektra.

371
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:32,716
Did you ever ask
why the Hand was after them?

372
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:37,851
- They don't know.
- Really? Mr. Miller doesn't know?

373
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:42,164
I do know.

374
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:47,061
The Hand wanted something
he couldn't give.

375
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,934
He tried to run.

376
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:52,202
And what?

377
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,675
They killed my wife, Abby's mom.

378
00:41:54,778 --> 00:41:57,338
There was no drunk driver.
I lied.

379
00:41:57,481 --> 00:41:59,381
You're on your own.

380
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:02,951
Why did you
really save them, Elektra?

381
00:42:03,053 --> 00:42:07,149
Some kind of penance?
A down payment on your sins?

382
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:10,750
Has she told you what she actually does
for a living, Mr. Miller?

383
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:14,262
She saved my life and my daughter's.
That's enough for me.

384
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,833
Then you landed on
the lucky side of the street.

385
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:20,267
- Damn, you son of a bitch!
- Because with most people...

386
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:35,275
Well, Elektra...

387
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,286
you haven't changed.

388
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:49,624
What are we gonna do?

389
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,928
Elektra?
What are we gonna do?

390
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:54,504
You gotta run.
As far as you can, as fast as you can.

391
00:42:54,605 --> 00:42:57,904
South America. Africa.
Change your name. Change your appearance.

392
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:01,307
- You're not coming with us?
- No.

393
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:08,946
- I can't.
- Why not? Isn't that part of your code or something?

394
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:11,021
I don't have a code, Abby.

395
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:13,351
- How are we supposed to defend ourselves?
- We'll be okay, Abby.

396
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:16,458
No, we won't.

397
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,687
Wake up, Dad. We won't.!

398
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:21,856
They're gonna hunt us down.
Just like Mom.

399
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:30,072
Get in the car.

400
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:33,537
Get in the car!

401
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:35,372
What's wrong?

402
00:44:01,238 --> 00:44:04,230
She's down the street.
Three blocks over in the parking lot.

403
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:09,743
We need to kill
the gaijin assassin first.

404
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:11,872
Should we go now?

405
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:15,281
Not here.
Keep track of them.

406
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:36,038
I'm a soccer mom.

407
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:41,711
So, you, um...
you really kill people for a living?

408
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:46,072
Yeah.

409
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:48,946
Why?

410
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,590
It's what I'm good at.

411
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,626
That's messed up.

412
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:01,430
Yeah.

413
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:23,144
Well, well,
the reluctant assassin.

414
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:27,886
Sorry to drag you
into this, McCabe.

415
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:30,118
Me too.

416
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:32,923
Hi. I'm Abby.

417
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:37,160
Hello, Abby. I'm wondering
what you're doing here.

418
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:40,293
There's plenty of room in the house. Go ahead
and help yourselves to whatever you need.

419
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:43,669
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

420
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:52,681
You want to pull the trigger,
or should I do it?

421
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:57,018
Oh, E.
You're crashin' on me, baby.

422
00:45:57,121 --> 00:46:00,090
I said you'd crash,
and you are crashing.

423
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:03,353
I just want to get 'em someplace safe,
give 'em a chance.

424
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:06,361
They're already dead, E.
They got no chance.

425
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:09,432
Don't go down with them.

426
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:14,936
I'll need passports.

427
00:46:15,038 --> 00:46:18,530
- I'll need plane tickets.

428
00:46:18,675 --> 00:46:21,542
Sure. Throw in
some season tickets to the Lakers.

429
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:28,051
Go.

430
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,704
I don't want you to tell her anything.

431
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:51,104
I hate lying.
Why can't we tell her?

432
00:46:51,241 --> 00:46:54,699
- We don't know anything about her.
- She saved us.

433
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:57,439
Because she doesn't
really know who you are. If she knew...

434
00:46:57,581 --> 00:46:59,811
- She's my friend.
- Your friend?

435
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:02,545
She's the only one I have.

436
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:05,383
- And I do not want to die with...
- You're not gonna die!

437
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,652
Don't you ever
say that again... ever.

438
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:15,527
- Okay?
- Yes.

439
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:28,575
Elektra?

440
00:47:39,556 --> 00:47:44,391
What's the matter? Is something wrong?
They told me to change my appearance, so...

441
00:47:46,897 --> 00:47:49,559
No, it's...
You look great.

442
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:52,226
Thanks.

443
00:47:57,174 --> 00:48:00,371
Can you show me how to use those things,
the, uh, salad tongs?

444
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:02,444
- Sais.
- Sais.

445
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:06,710
They're not for you.

446
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:08,717
I want to learn
how to defend myself.

447
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:11,481
They're offensive weapons.
They're for killing.

448
00:48:11,588 --> 00:48:13,920
You use them.

449
00:48:14,024 --> 00:48:16,652
I don't want you to be like me.

450
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,455
I do.

451
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,800
Do you wanna learn
something really, really difficult?

452
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,474
Yeah. What?

453
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:34,941
Come on.

454
00:48:41,218 --> 00:48:43,209
Now sit down.

455
00:48:51,228 --> 00:48:54,459
- Close your eyes.
- What is this, yoga?

456
00:48:54,564 --> 00:48:57,499
- No, it's called kimagure.
- Kimagure.

457
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:00,866
It's more valuable
than learning to use a weapon...

458
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:03,940
because it allows you to see
what's gonna happen before it happens.

459
00:49:04,074 --> 00:49:06,565
- That's intense. How do you do it?
- Concentrate.

460
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:08,610
Meditate.

461
00:49:08,712 --> 00:49:11,374
Let go of yourself and see everything
around you. It's not easy.

462
00:49:11,481 --> 00:49:13,381
How long did it
take you to master?

463
00:49:13,483 --> 00:49:15,383
I never actually
finished my training.

464
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:17,976
I only know enough
to keep myself alive.

465
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:23,390
But there are true masters like Stick
who can use kimagure to bring back the dead.

466
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:27,486
- Wow.
- Close your eyes and breathe.

467
00:49:36,573 --> 00:49:38,632
Just sit quietly.

468
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:48,580
Shh!

469
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,767
How are you doing?

470
00:50:41,805 --> 00:50:45,263
We're still alive.
Thank you.

471
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,876
Oh, don't thank me, Mark.

472
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:53,381
Please, you don't really
know what I was doing.

473
00:50:53,483 --> 00:50:55,542
What you were doing there?

474
00:50:55,652 --> 00:50:57,745
Sure I do.

475
00:50:57,854 --> 00:50:59,754
You were there to kill us.

476
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:03,691
I knew it as soon
as you took the Wheelwright place.

477
00:51:18,942 --> 00:51:21,410
I'm not a good person
to get involved with.

478
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,980
I'm not asking for anything.

479
00:51:53,009 --> 00:51:55,477
I'm sorry.

480
00:51:55,579 --> 00:51:59,811
Yeah, I hated that.

481
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:22,505
E, get back.
Get back now.!

482
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:28,106
- What happened?

483
00:52:28,245 --> 00:52:31,373
That bird's been hanging around here
since late yesterday.

484
00:52:38,722 --> 00:52:40,622
They're here.

485
00:52:42,092 --> 00:52:44,356
- They're here.
- Let's use the truck.

486
00:52:44,461 --> 00:52:47,328
- We won't make it.
- But that's the best way.

487
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:49,330
Trust me.
There isn't time.

488
00:52:50,534 --> 00:52:52,434
Use the cellar.
There's a tunnel.

489
00:52:52,536 --> 00:52:55,903
Take you out past the orchard
to the trees. Head north.

490
00:52:57,607 --> 00:53:00,872
What about you?

491
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:04,037
- Shit.

492
00:53:06,082 --> 00:53:08,812
Let's go.

493
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:13,378
- Be careful.
- Keep 'em safe.

494
00:53:44,921 --> 00:53:47,014
- Holy...

495
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:05,966
Don't tell me, the circus is in town, huh?
I'll tell you what.

496
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:08,543
You might as well kill me now,
'cause I ain't talking.

497
00:54:08,645 --> 00:54:10,772
Talking is not necessary.

498
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:14,611
- But I accept the first half of your proposal.

499
00:54:28,498 --> 00:54:33,026
They're in the woods.
Typhoid, Stone, Tattoo.

500
00:54:33,136 --> 00:54:36,902
Get Kinkou,
head there now. Hurry.
