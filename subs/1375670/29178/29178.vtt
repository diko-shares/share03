1
00:00:00,253 --> 00:00:01,718
Previously on "Cardinal".

2
00:00:01,754 --> 00:00:03,654
You embarrassed me in
front of my students.

3
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:04,654
You wouldn't answer your phone.

4
00:00:04,689 --> 00:00:05,655
I'm fine.

5
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:06,656
Lise Delorme.

6
00:00:06,691 --> 00:00:08,658
Yeah she was investigating him,

7
00:00:08,693 --> 00:00:09,693
thought he was dirty

8
00:00:09,727 --> 00:00:12,028
when he was covering up
for your phone call.

9
00:00:12,063 --> 00:00:15,031
All he ever wanted was to protect you.

10
00:00:15,066 --> 00:00:17,000
You better not be using again, Kev.

11
00:00:17,035 --> 00:00:18,035
I'm not.

12
00:00:19,271 --> 00:00:20,369
Anybody in the truck?

13
00:00:20,405 --> 00:00:22,171
No, car's registered to Raymond Bedford.

14
00:00:22,206 --> 00:00:23,238
Here he is.

15
00:00:23,274 --> 00:00:24,706
Raymond Bedford.

16
00:00:24,741 --> 00:00:25,874
Ray Northwind.

17
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,242
You know what? You keep it.

18
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:28,343
I'm out.

19
00:00:28,378 --> 00:00:29,378
There is no out.

20
00:00:29,413 --> 00:00:31,013
You work for my now,

21
00:00:31,048 --> 00:00:32,848
alive or dead.

22
00:00:32,883 --> 00:00:34,016
I want the redhead,

23
00:00:34,051 --> 00:00:35,017
where is she?

24
00:00:35,052 --> 00:00:36,185
In protective custody.

25
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,853
This was inspired by Palo Mayombe,

26
00:00:38,888 --> 00:00:40,021
but that's not what this is.

27
00:00:40,056 --> 00:00:41,889
What do you make of the
missing body parts?

28
00:00:41,925 --> 00:00:43,357
You put them in your iron pot,

29
00:00:43,392 --> 00:00:45,526
you would need fresh
blood to keep it working.

30
00:00:45,561 --> 00:00:46,861
More sacrifices.

31
00:00:46,896 --> 00:00:48,595
The most potent
time would be at new moon.

32
00:00:52,101 --> 00:00:53,201
Everyone out, now!

33
00:00:53,236 --> 00:00:56,069
I didn't recognize her power before.

34
00:00:56,104 --> 00:00:57,437
Bring her back to me.

35
00:00:57,472 --> 00:00:58,972
I need her alive.

36
00:01:06,915 --> 00:01:08,081
Piper.

37
00:01:09,251 --> 00:01:10,717
I need to see the security footage.

38
00:01:10,752 --> 00:01:11,917
It's inside.

39
00:01:11,953 --> 00:01:13,897
The Chief said the fire
was contained to the shed.

40
00:01:13,921 --> 00:01:15,420
We're good to go back in.

41
00:01:18,425 --> 00:01:19,725
Lise, inside.

42
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,093
I'll be right there.

43
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:24,930
They think the fire started
in the crawl space.

44
00:01:27,434 --> 00:01:28,600
That's him.

45
00:01:29,102 --> 00:01:30,102
Leon Rutkowski.

46
00:01:30,136 --> 00:01:31,802
Let's see that again. And slow it down.

47
00:01:34,174 --> 00:01:36,174
We think he's the one who shot her.

48
00:01:43,449 --> 00:01:44,615
Find anything?

49
00:01:45,185 --> 00:01:46,850
Nothing to tell us where he took her.

50
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,456
Must have been watching the place,

51
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,193
and picked his moment.

52
00:01:58,297 --> 00:02:00,297
Somebody told him she was here.

53
00:02:00,332 --> 00:02:01,498
Yeah, who?

54
00:02:02,134 --> 00:02:03,443
The only people who knew she was here

55
00:02:03,467 --> 00:02:04,800
are the other women.

56
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,403
And our team.

57
00:02:14,812 --> 00:02:16,612
We've got BOLOS out on

58
00:02:16,647 --> 00:02:18,347
Terri and Kevin Tait,

59
00:02:18,383 --> 00:02:20,282
Raymond Bedford,

60
00:02:20,317 --> 00:02:21,983
and Leon Rutkowski.

61
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:23,785
He might be driving

62
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,453
an older model blue car.

63
00:02:25,488 --> 00:02:27,488
How did Leon know what shelter to hit?

64
00:02:28,658 --> 00:02:31,492
Look, if anyone in this room
said anything to anybody,

65
00:02:31,528 --> 00:02:33,194
now is the moment to speak up.

66
00:02:36,066 --> 00:02:38,058
We're not going home until we find them.

67
00:02:39,335 --> 00:02:40,801
Tomorrow is the new moon.

68
00:02:40,836 --> 00:02:42,869
That's Bedford's favourite day

69
00:02:42,905 --> 00:02:44,856
for ritual sacrifice.

70
00:03:56,941 --> 00:04:04,941
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com.

71
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:15,790
Ray, I'm sorry.

72
00:04:17,428 --> 00:04:18,760
I had only three rules.

73
00:04:20,596 --> 00:04:21,762
I know.

74
00:04:25,921 --> 00:04:27,921
When my mother tried to get clean.

75
00:04:31,141 --> 00:04:33,141
She said it was like being ripped open.

76
00:04:38,447 --> 00:04:40,113
Death would be a relief, wouldn't it?

77
00:04:41,316 --> 00:04:42,482
Please.

78
00:04:46,455 --> 00:04:47,854
It's only going to get worse.

79
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:08,307
Given you enough, Kevin.

80
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,810
Now you're going to give me

81
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,181
all your pain.

82
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:27,657
Yeah.

83
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:29,526
Yeah, okay, thanks.

84
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:30,727
Yeah.

85
00:05:31,363 --> 00:05:32,463
John.

86
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,131
Went back over the Toronto unsolveds.

87
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,133
Ran them against the
name 'Raymond Bedford'.

88
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:37,834
I might have something. Take a look.

89
00:05:39,004 --> 00:05:40,004
Aaron Osborne.

90
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:41,972
His torso was found in
the Don River, 2016.

91
00:05:42,007 --> 00:05:43,974
Missing head, hands, and feet.

92
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:45,141
Same as Dave Elhurst.

93
00:05:45,176 --> 00:05:46,809
What's the connection to Bedford?

94
00:05:46,844 --> 00:05:48,644
Both from Sudbury. So I checked.

95
00:05:48,679 --> 00:05:49,823
They went to the same elementary school

96
00:05:49,847 --> 00:05:50,879
in grades two to five.

97
00:05:50,915 --> 00:05:52,648
Nice work.

98
00:05:52,683 --> 00:05:54,717
Get me everything you can on Osborne

99
00:05:54,752 --> 00:05:56,152
and anyone else who knew them both.

100
00:05:56,187 --> 00:05:57,153
Already on it.

101
00:05:57,188 --> 00:05:58,566
Bedford has a sealed juvenile record.

102
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:59,555
He attacked his foster parent-

103
00:05:59,591 --> 00:06:01,323
She died of cancer two years ago.

104
00:06:01,358 --> 00:06:03,636
II managed to track
down his social worker.

105
00:06:03,672 --> 00:06:05,193
Sandra Mason. She's on her way in.

106
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:07,350
You're on fire, McLeod.

107
00:06:08,064 --> 00:06:09,231
Good.

108
00:06:28,717 --> 00:06:30,050
They found your truck.

109
00:06:34,723 --> 00:06:36,556
They know your real name.

110
00:06:37,392 --> 00:06:38,536
They know that you threatened the chief

111
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,360
in Moose Bay.

112
00:06:40,395 --> 00:06:42,469
You gotta let the Tait girl go.

113
00:06:43,064 --> 00:06:44,730
Alan, relax.

114
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:47,305
My work's not finished here.

115
00:06:49,404 --> 00:06:50,615
Jesus, you gotta get out of here

116
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,871
while you still can.

117
00:06:51,906 --> 00:06:53,438
You're asking me to give up everything

118
00:06:53,474 --> 00:06:54,706
I've worked so hard for.

119
00:06:54,741 --> 00:06:56,020
I'm trying to protect you.

120
00:06:56,056 --> 00:06:57,561
You're trying to run me out of town.

121
00:06:57,596 --> 00:06:59,545
If you go down, I go down too.

122
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,712
What did you expect?

123
00:07:00,747 --> 00:07:02,161
I get rid of Lasalle,

124
00:07:02,196 --> 00:07:03,248
you get rid of me?

125
00:07:09,622 --> 00:07:10,788
You know, I...

126
00:07:11,957 --> 00:07:15,726
think you should get Evie a new bike.

127
00:07:15,761 --> 00:07:18,762
'Cause that old red one is just too...

128
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:21,432
it's too small for her.

129
00:07:33,111 --> 00:07:34,277
Now.

130
00:07:39,618 --> 00:07:42,419
Who am I supposed to be running from?

131
00:07:51,128 --> 00:07:52,789
It's John Cardinal.

132
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,846
Is Raymond Ojibwe?

133
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,718
His parents were Hungarian, I think.

134
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:08,585
And you said he attacked you?

135
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:10,198
Fireplace poker.

136
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:13,891
When I told him he couldn't
live with his mother anymore.

137
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:16,104
But you never reported it.

138
00:08:17,095 --> 00:08:18,606
He was nine.

139
00:08:19,097 --> 00:08:22,065
I wanted to believe it was an accident.

140
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,967
Can you give us any more specifics

141
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,735
about Raymond?

142
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,907
You don't forget a kid like that.

143
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:30,406
Extremely bright.

144
00:08:30,441 --> 00:08:33,075
Obsessed with death and religion,

145
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,144
anything to do with the afterlife.

146
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:38,915
At first, I encouraged his curiosity,

147
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,583
it was good to see a kid reading a book.

148
00:08:41,618 --> 00:08:42,918
But then

149
00:08:42,953 --> 00:08:47,052
he asked me if I'd ever
seen the inside of a cat.

150
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:49,925
And he went into graphic detail,

151
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,994
how Leonardo da Vinci found god

152
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,462
inside corpses.

153
00:08:56,967 --> 00:08:58,933
And the look in his eye.

154
00:08:58,968 --> 00:09:01,936
Did you ever see him hurt an animal?

155
00:09:01,971 --> 00:09:03,938
Catch him in the act? No. But,

156
00:09:03,973 --> 00:09:04,939
around that time,

157
00:09:04,974 --> 00:09:06,974
animals were going missing.

158
00:09:07,009 --> 00:09:08,475
And after Raymond left-

159
00:09:09,011 --> 00:09:10,611
it stopped.

160
00:09:10,646 --> 00:09:11,946
Where did he go?

161
00:09:11,981 --> 00:09:14,448
Florida, I heard.

162
00:09:14,483 --> 00:09:16,115
But he'd aged out of the system,

163
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,650
so we didn't keep tabs.

164
00:09:17,686 --> 00:09:20,820
Do you remember an Aaron Osborne?

165
00:09:20,855 --> 00:09:22,622
He went to school with Raymond.

166
00:09:22,657 --> 00:09:24,657
The kid he bashed with the shovel.

167
00:09:24,693 --> 00:09:26,459
Yeah. What happened?

168
00:09:26,494 --> 00:09:29,219
Aaron called his mother a biker slut.

169
00:09:30,732 --> 00:09:32,998
She was associated with bikers?

170
00:09:33,033 --> 00:09:33,999
Mhm.

171
00:09:34,034 --> 00:09:35,467
For years.

172
00:09:35,502 --> 00:09:37,502
They passed her around 'til
there was nothing left.

173
00:09:40,674 --> 00:09:42,641
Ray was 11 when he hit Aaron Osborne

174
00:09:42,676 --> 00:09:43,809
with a shovel.

175
00:09:43,844 --> 00:09:45,644
Then he found him again in Toronto,

176
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:46,878
20 years later.

177
00:09:46,914 --> 00:09:48,313
Hell of a grudge.

178
00:09:48,348 --> 00:09:50,444
Sensitive about his mom.

179
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:54,151
Maybe that's why he
targeted the Northern Raiders.

180
00:09:54,186 --> 00:09:55,352
Payback.

181
00:09:57,356 --> 00:10:00,992
So, he's fascinated with
death and immortality

182
00:10:01,027 --> 00:10:01,993
and then he-

183
00:10:02,028 --> 00:10:04,161
he finds Palo Mayombe.

184
00:10:04,196 --> 00:10:06,663
It would give a kid like
him a sense of control

185
00:10:06,698 --> 00:10:08,665
over the chaos in his life.

186
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,199
He learns the basics in Sudbury,

187
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,502
and then he goes to
Florida to learn more.

188
00:10:12,537 --> 00:10:13,503
That makes sense.

189
00:10:13,538 --> 00:10:16,006
There's a Palo Mayombe community there.

190
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:18,309
I'll start to make some calls.

191
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:22,355
A woman came to see me yesterday.

192
00:10:24,115 --> 00:10:26,355
She assumed I knew John had
been paying her to keep quiet

193
00:10:26,383 --> 00:10:27,716
about what I'd done.

194
00:10:30,054 --> 00:10:31,781
What is it you did?

195
00:10:36,226 --> 00:10:38,360
I made a call

196
00:10:38,395 --> 00:10:39,361
when I was manic

197
00:10:39,396 --> 00:10:41,458
and I blew an officer's cover.

198
00:10:43,733 --> 00:10:45,099
John never told you.

199
00:10:46,435 --> 00:10:48,506
He risked his job for me.

200
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,136
And how did you
feel when you learned this?

201
00:10:55,244 --> 00:10:57,778
A man is dead because of me.

202
00:10:57,813 --> 00:10:59,893
How do you think I feel?

203
00:11:06,121 --> 00:11:08,254
Devastated.

204
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,255
Shocked.

205
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:11,058
Furious.

206
00:11:11,093 --> 00:11:12,258
With yourself.

207
00:11:13,162 --> 00:11:14,741
With my illness.

208
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:18,397
With John for risking
everything to protect me.

209
00:11:18,432 --> 00:11:19,398
If he'd been caught,

210
00:11:19,433 --> 00:11:21,433
who would've been there for Kelly?

211
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:26,471
What did John say?

212
00:11:28,342 --> 00:11:29,675
I haven't told him.

213
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:32,643
Why not?

214
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:35,080
He's heading a difficult
investigation right now

215
00:11:35,115 --> 00:11:37,115
and he's already had to step away once.

216
00:11:38,284 --> 00:11:39,617
You feel like a burden.

217
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,741
Hey man, you got a second?

218
00:11:57,469 --> 00:11:58,479
Yeah. That's about all I got.

219
00:11:58,503 --> 00:11:59,703
What's up?

220
00:12:00,813 --> 00:12:02,947
I called your contact
at the DEA in Michigan.

221
00:12:03,976 --> 00:12:05,109
Why?

222
00:12:05,144 --> 00:12:06,809
I couldn't get a hold of you.

223
00:12:10,815 --> 00:12:11,981
You okay?

224
00:12:12,483 --> 00:12:15,118
Yeah. The ex got a job in Thunder Bay.

225
00:12:15,153 --> 00:12:16,853
Thinks she can just take the kids.

226
00:12:16,888 --> 00:12:18,454
Aw man, that sucks.

227
00:12:18,489 --> 00:12:20,431
It is what it is.

228
00:12:21,826 --> 00:12:23,625
Michigan didn't know anything about.

229
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,660
Bedford posing as Ray Northwind.

230
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:28,541
Well I haven't had a
chance to update them

231
00:12:28,565 --> 00:12:30,498
since we last talked.

232
00:12:30,533 --> 00:12:31,978
Lasalle's getting ready to make a move.

233
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:34,136
They didn't know
we had a new player in town.

234
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:36,304
Now they're up to date now.

235
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:37,851
Said they'd call if they got any leads

236
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:38,974
on Bedford stateside.

237
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:40,841
Well, I appreciate that, Jerry.

238
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,010
But I gotta run.

239
00:12:44,914 --> 00:12:46,080
Sure.

240
00:13:00,528 --> 00:13:01,694
Leon.

241
00:13:04,232 --> 00:13:06,332
You gotta get me outta here, man.

242
00:13:09,358 --> 00:13:10,690
Leon, we're friends.

243
00:13:11,273 --> 00:13:12,438
Mhm.

244
00:13:14,775 --> 00:13:16,613
You're not like him.

245
00:13:19,746 --> 00:13:22,848
Ray gave you a shot, Kevin.

246
00:13:22,883 --> 00:13:25,717
You could've had anything you wanted.

247
00:13:29,123 --> 00:13:30,455
You betrayed him.

248
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:32,856
Leon. No.

249
00:13:33,226 --> 00:13:34,391
Wait.

250
00:13:34,928 --> 00:13:35,893
Leon.

251
00:13:35,929 --> 00:13:37,094
Leon!

252
00:13:38,898 --> 00:13:40,231
Please Leon, wait!

253
00:13:50,275 --> 00:13:51,541
Terri?

254
00:14:18,051 --> 00:14:21,120
Detective Gonzalez
from Miami is on line two.

255
00:14:21,145 --> 00:14:22,787
Thanks for getting back to us.

256
00:14:22,823 --> 00:14:24,353
I appreciate the call.

257
00:14:24,354 --> 00:14:25,620
We've got a string of unsolveds

258
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,088
dating back to 2008.

259
00:14:27,123 --> 00:14:28,924
Missing heads, hands, feet.

260
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,926
All removed while the victim was alive.

261
00:14:30,961 --> 00:14:32,326
Our guy likes coloured shells,

262
00:14:32,362 --> 00:14:33,327
sharpened sticks

263
00:14:33,363 --> 00:14:36,431
and chalk drawings of arrows and moons.

264
00:14:36,466 --> 00:14:39,433
Yeah, some twisted
version of Palo Mayombe.

265
00:14:39,468 --> 00:14:41,013
Freaked the hell out of
the Cuban community here.

266
00:14:41,037 --> 00:14:42,335
They call them 'El Brujo'.

267
00:14:42,371 --> 00:14:43,771
The witch.

268
00:14:43,806 --> 00:14:45,205
When was the last case?

269
00:14:46,141 --> 00:14:48,275
It's been quiet since 2016.

270
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:49,977
That's when they found
Osborne in Toronto.

271
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,947
Have you ever questioned

272
00:14:52,982 --> 00:14:54,948
a guy named Raymond Bedford?

273
00:14:54,983 --> 00:14:55,949
I don't recognize the name.

274
00:14:55,984 --> 00:14:58,284
But we got unknown DNA
at one of the scenes.

275
00:14:58,319 --> 00:14:59,852
If you catch this guy,

276
00:14:59,888 --> 00:15:01,054
let me know.

277
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,355
We're working on that.

278
00:15:03,391 --> 00:15:05,491
We spent eight years trying to nail him.

279
00:15:05,526 --> 00:15:06,492
Say what you want,

280
00:15:06,527 --> 00:15:08,628
he's got some kinda power on his side.

281
00:15:08,663 --> 00:15:09,963
Thanks for all your help.

282
00:15:09,998 --> 00:15:11,330
Buena suerte.

283
00:15:17,504 --> 00:15:18,837
I've seen that before.

284
00:15:35,221 --> 00:15:36,320
Hi.

285
00:15:36,355 --> 00:15:37,989
Hey. I need your help with something.

286
00:15:38,024 --> 00:15:40,691
You took a photo of a wooden eagle.

287
00:15:40,727 --> 00:15:41,692
Rotting. Low angle.

288
00:15:41,728 --> 00:15:43,060
You remember that?

289
00:15:44,196 --> 00:15:45,362
Yes.

290
00:15:47,424 --> 00:15:48,590
You okay?

291
00:15:52,104 --> 00:15:54,395
Fine. I know the shot you mean.

292
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,574
Where'd you take it?

293
00:15:59,077 --> 00:16:00,510
Um, I'm not sure exactly.

294
00:16:00,545 --> 00:16:01,845
Somewhere off 64.

295
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,379
I got lost looking for the
Lynx Creek headwaters.

296
00:16:04,414 --> 00:16:06,574
Which side of 64?

297
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:08,717
Is it a side road?

298
00:16:08,753 --> 00:16:09,718
Dirt? Paved?

299
00:16:09,754 --> 00:16:12,521
Anything you can recall will be helpful.

300
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:13,522
East I think.

301
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:14,690
South of 17.

302
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:17,726
Um, dirt road.

303
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:20,061
Private property.

304
00:16:20,096 --> 00:16:22,196
There were 'No Trespassing' signs.

305
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,532
The eagle was on a gatepost.

306
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:25,700
Was there anything else?

307
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,535
You see any cottages? Any vehicles?

308
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,736
Anything.

309
00:16:29,472 --> 00:16:30,738
Nothing but trees.

310
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:34,375
Um, there was a dead birch,

311
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,544
black and silver at the side of the road.

312
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,879
Looks like it was hit by lightning.

313
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,747
I shot it. Do you remember?

314
00:16:41,784 --> 00:16:44,217
Yeah. Yeah, I think I do.

315
00:16:44,252 --> 00:16:45,919
That's just before the turn off.

316
00:16:47,422 --> 00:16:49,222
Is this about the missing woman?

317
00:16:49,257 --> 00:16:51,091
I have to go. Talk later?

318
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,705
Focus on what you need to do.

319
00:16:57,965 --> 00:16:59,131
Thanks. Bye.

320
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:00,966
Bye.

321
00:17:09,844 --> 00:17:10,909
We're running out of time.

322
00:17:10,944 --> 00:17:12,443
We need to split up.

323
00:17:12,478 --> 00:17:13,644
That's OPD jurisdiction.

324
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,246
Yeah. You get Commanda,

325
00:17:15,281 --> 00:17:16,447
and cover this area.

326
00:17:16,482 --> 00:17:17,615
I'll talk to Clegg,

327
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,317
see if he's available to go through here.

328
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,425
Terri.

329
00:17:29,294 --> 00:17:30,427
Please Terri.

330
00:17:44,876 --> 00:17:46,042
No.

331
00:17:46,377 --> 00:17:47,543
No.

332
00:17:50,982 --> 00:17:52,314
What did you do to her?

333
00:17:53,317 --> 00:17:54,784
Leon gave her a little something

334
00:17:54,819 --> 00:17:56,485
keep her calm on the drive over.

335
00:17:59,724 --> 00:18:00,890
Ray.

336
00:18:02,392 --> 00:18:03,558
Ray, please.

337
00:18:05,328 --> 00:18:06,494
Don't do this.

338
00:18:07,664 --> 00:18:09,330
She's got nothing to do with this.

339
00:18:10,868 --> 00:18:13,869
She has everything to do with this.

340
00:18:21,343 --> 00:18:22,676
Brother and sister.

341
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,712
Under a new moon.

342
00:18:26,548 --> 00:18:28,341
What an incredible gift.

343
00:18:37,525 --> 00:18:38,691
Ray.

344
00:18:43,531 --> 00:18:45,863
If a bullet to her head
didn't stop her on this side,

345
00:18:47,368 --> 00:18:48,668
imagine what she could do for me

346
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,369
on the other.

347
00:19:36,391 --> 00:19:37,724
Can I get you another?

348
00:19:48,803 --> 00:19:49,968
No, I'm done.

349
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:22,523
Terri.

350
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:23,558
Terri.

351
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:27,094
Get it back.

352
00:21:27,129 --> 00:21:29,140
- This exact conversation-
- KEVIN: This is not. No!

353
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:30,464
So many times Kevin!

354
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:32,498
- I just want you to-
- TERRI: Kevin!

355
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:38,322
You left me with them.

356
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:46,011
When have I ever left you?

357
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,354
Just let me die.

358
00:21:57,023 --> 00:21:58,842
I wish that I could.

359
00:22:29,721 --> 00:22:31,198
All you've got is a drawing of an eagle

360
00:22:31,222 --> 00:22:33,189
from the girl's art therapy.

361
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:36,393
It's the best lead we have.

362
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,290
But you don't know that's where Leon's-

363
00:22:41,399 --> 00:22:42,531
Shit!

364
00:22:42,566 --> 00:22:43,865
What? Did you get stung?

365
00:22:43,901 --> 00:22:46,702
Yeah. It's a wasp.

366
00:22:46,737 --> 00:22:48,100
I'm allergic.

367
00:22:48,906 --> 00:22:50,539
You need an epipen or something?

368
00:22:50,574 --> 00:22:53,275
No, no, no, no. It's not that serious.

369
00:22:53,311 --> 00:22:55,311
I swell up and I get a little dizzy.

370
00:22:56,913 --> 00:22:57,878
You know what,

371
00:22:57,914 --> 00:22:59,057
if you check in the glove box,

372
00:22:59,081 --> 00:23:01,201
there should some antihistamines
in the first aid kit.

373
00:23:04,287 --> 00:23:05,753
No, no kit.

374
00:23:07,156 --> 00:23:08,756
Must be in the back.

375
00:23:08,792 --> 00:23:10,792
You know what, I'm gonna
have to pull over.

376
00:23:23,171 --> 00:23:24,738
Hey, you mind checking the trunk?

377
00:23:24,773 --> 00:23:25,939
Sure.

378
00:23:34,615 --> 00:23:35,581
Here.

379
00:23:35,616 --> 00:23:36,782
Yeah.

380
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,653
That's great. Thank you.

381
00:23:41,155 --> 00:23:43,656
You know it's probably a
good idea if you drive.

382
00:23:43,691 --> 00:23:44,857
Sure.

383
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:19,623
Okay. Okay.

384
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:21,659
Almost!

385
00:24:45,348 --> 00:24:46,515
Go.

386
00:24:47,384 --> 00:24:48,550
Just go.

387
00:24:50,921 --> 00:24:52,086
No.

388
00:24:52,188 --> 00:24:53,725
Kevin.

389
00:24:54,725 --> 00:24:56,323
Push up. Push up!

390
00:24:56,358 --> 00:24:57,324
I can't.

391
00:24:57,359 --> 00:24:58,325
Kevin. Push up.

392
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,827
I will do the rest.

393
00:24:59,862 --> 00:25:01,662
Kevin. Help me once!

394
00:25:01,697 --> 00:25:02,697
Please!

395
00:25:08,704 --> 00:25:09,870
I'm sorry, Terri.

396
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,656
- We have to go.
- Okay.

397
00:25:12,692 --> 00:25:13,692
Now.

398
00:25:24,167 --> 00:25:25,314
Here.

399
00:25:59,251 --> 00:26:00,417
Leon.

400
00:26:09,427 --> 00:26:10,627
Hang her up.

401
00:26:13,264 --> 00:26:14,430
I know,

402
00:26:15,467 --> 00:26:17,400
you want to see that moment

403
00:26:17,435 --> 00:26:18,480
when I take control of them

404
00:26:18,504 --> 00:26:19,936
in the afterlife.

405
00:26:22,803 --> 00:26:25,908
There's only one way
to make sure that they obey me.

406
00:26:25,943 --> 00:26:28,944
I have to take them to the
outer limit of their suffering.

407
00:26:29,947 --> 00:26:31,313
And it's there

408
00:26:31,348 --> 00:26:33,916
that I sever their ties

409
00:26:34,484 --> 00:26:35,650
to this world.

410
00:26:39,122 --> 00:26:41,083
The orishas,

411
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:44,044
they delivered them to me, Leon.

412
00:26:47,296 --> 00:26:48,763
Gas up the boat.

413
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:50,264
We'll leave when I'm done.

414
00:26:50,698 --> 00:26:51,864
Take the stash.

415
00:27:05,681 --> 00:27:06,847
Please.

416
00:27:07,983 --> 00:27:09,650
Please. Please, let...

417
00:27:10,352 --> 00:27:12,823
Just let us go.

418
00:27:14,522 --> 00:27:17,077
You try and try and try, Terri...

419
00:27:19,694 --> 00:27:21,027
but some people...

420
00:27:23,497 --> 00:27:24,830
they can't be saved.

421
00:27:39,846 --> 00:27:41,012
Alan Clegg

422
00:27:42,849 --> 00:27:44,393
approached me at the bar
a couple nights ago,

423
00:27:44,417 --> 00:27:45,827
said he'd turned some biker's girlfriend.

424
00:27:45,851 --> 00:27:47,317
Needed a safe place to put her.

425
00:27:47,352 --> 00:27:48,986
Said he called the shelter on Maclntyre

426
00:27:49,021 --> 00:27:50,353
but they were full.

427
00:27:52,123 --> 00:27:53,622
Then he asked about Pine Street.

428
00:27:55,194 --> 00:27:56,226
You didn't tell him

429
00:27:56,261 --> 00:27:57,995
that we just put Terri in there.

430
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:59,362
I didn't use any names.

431
00:28:06,763 --> 00:28:08,063
Is that it?

432
00:28:08,088 --> 00:28:09,054
There it is.

433
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:10,245
Dead tree.

434
00:28:18,382 --> 00:28:19,548
Keep driving.

435
00:28:29,231 --> 00:28:31,064
I know what it's like Alan.

436
00:28:32,429 --> 00:28:34,195
You try to do what's right.

437
00:28:34,231 --> 00:28:35,263
You risk your family.

438
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:36,364
And for what?

439
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:37,765
Nothing ever changes.

440
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:40,635
What's done is done.

441
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:44,472
Turn there.

442
00:29:03,656 --> 00:29:05,322
No response
from either Cardinal or Clegg.

443
00:29:08,494 --> 00:29:10,794
Onboard tracking puts Clegg's cruiser

444
00:29:10,829 --> 00:29:11,795
east of 64.

445
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,297
Close to the lake.

446
00:29:13,332 --> 00:29:14,664
Looks like they parked.

447
00:29:15,166 --> 00:29:17,032
You should have the coordinates.

448
00:29:17,068 --> 00:29:18,234
Do you have them?

449
00:29:20,171 --> 00:29:21,637
Yeah there's not much out there.

450
00:29:21,673 --> 00:29:23,138
Lots of places to hide.

451
00:29:23,174 --> 00:29:24,139
Okay, got it.

452
00:29:24,175 --> 00:29:26,475
There used to be a private
summer camp there.

453
00:29:26,511 --> 00:29:27,476
Back up is on the way.

454
00:29:27,512 --> 00:29:28,877
Yeah, we can't wait.

455
00:29:30,348 --> 00:29:31,646
So Clegg was a mole.

456
00:29:31,682 --> 00:29:32,980
It explains how Bedford knew

457
00:29:33,016 --> 00:29:34,649
where Lasalle stashed his money.

458
00:29:34,685 --> 00:29:36,150
And when to hit Wombat.

459
00:29:36,186 --> 00:29:38,687
I knew something was up
with Lasalle yesterday.

460
00:29:38,722 --> 00:29:41,489
He's seen what Bedford
does to his victims.

461
00:29:41,525 --> 00:29:42,824
Try Cardinal again.

462
00:29:42,859 --> 00:29:44,226
All right.

463
00:29:47,897 --> 00:29:49,496
You've reached Detective John Cardinal,

464
00:29:49,532 --> 00:29:50,676
Algonquin Bay Police Department-

465
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,832
Shit.

466
00:30:20,061 --> 00:30:21,227
Raymond!

467
00:30:25,733 --> 00:30:26,698
Okay, we're close.

468
00:30:26,734 --> 00:30:27,899
We're really close.

469
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:31,703
There.

470
00:30:39,438 --> 00:30:41,271
You don't have to do this, Alan.

471
00:30:42,081 --> 00:30:43,414
I can't lose my kids.

472
00:30:56,001 --> 00:30:57,199
John Cardinal.

473
00:30:58,883 --> 00:31:00,282
Cree name, ain't it?

474
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:02,599
It's over.

475
00:31:04,436 --> 00:31:06,269
There are more cops on the way.

476
00:31:08,674 --> 00:31:10,106
You can't stop me, John.

477
00:31:10,642 --> 00:31:12,074
Nobody can.

478
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,509
You're nothing special.

479
00:31:14,885 --> 00:31:16,775
You're just another killer.

480
00:31:26,123 --> 00:31:27,289
Your daughter-

481
00:31:28,051 --> 00:31:29,250
Kelly.

482
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:33,328
What happens to her after you die?

483
00:31:35,531 --> 00:31:37,364
Is she going to look after Catherine?

484
00:31:39,902 --> 00:31:41,135
Just a matter of time

485
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:43,003
before the demons take over.

486
00:31:45,007 --> 00:31:47,347
So you paid for some information.

487
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:51,017
Nothing spiritual in that.

488
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,357
Kill him.

489
00:32:07,362 --> 00:32:08,527
Do it.

490
00:32:31,551 --> 00:32:32,950
Geez. Alan.

491
00:32:35,722 --> 00:32:36,855
You're gonna be okay.

492
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:37,856
You're gonna be okay.

493
00:32:37,891 --> 00:32:39,022
Here, put this on it.

494
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:40,057
Put this on it.

495
00:33:01,078 --> 00:33:02,745
The bikers are coming.

496
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:04,580
What?

497
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:06,816
The bikers are coming.

498
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,790
Jesus.

499
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:16,425
Keep pressure.

500
00:33:19,262 --> 00:33:20,829
I'll stay here with him.

501
00:33:22,766 --> 00:33:23,732
Alright buddy,

502
00:33:23,767 --> 00:33:25,862
you're gonna be fine, okay.

503
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:28,603
Terri!

504
00:33:38,448 --> 00:33:39,814
Help me!

505
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:41,615
Help!

506
00:33:46,021 --> 00:33:47,654
Is anybody there?

507
00:33:51,025 --> 00:33:52,291
Please.

508
00:33:52,494 --> 00:33:53,693
Please help!

509
00:34:02,471 --> 00:34:03,436
Kevin.

510
00:34:03,471 --> 00:34:04,636
Kevin?

511
00:34:06,707 --> 00:34:07,673
It's gonna be okay.

512
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:09,274
We're going to get you out of here.

513
00:34:09,309 --> 00:34:10,509
Where's Terri?

514
00:34:10,611 --> 00:34:12,450
Hehe took her.

515
00:34:23,886 --> 00:34:24,851
Get him on the road.

516
00:34:24,887 --> 00:34:26,086
Get an ambulance to meet ya.

517
00:34:26,121 --> 00:34:27,387
Yeah.

518
00:34:37,331 --> 00:34:38,475
I never should've brought her.

519
00:34:38,499 --> 00:34:40,499
We just need to get you out of here.

520
00:34:41,101 --> 00:34:42,668
- Kevin.
- Kevin!

521
00:34:52,144 --> 00:34:54,409
Wanna go on a little boat ride?

522
00:34:55,948 --> 00:34:57,815
Hands on the table!

523
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:59,249
Don't move or I'll kill you!

524
00:35:04,524 --> 00:35:05,790
Let her go!

525
00:35:09,795 --> 00:35:11,628
That's one of your friends.

526
00:35:13,965 --> 00:35:15,932
Cuff yourself to the motor.

527
00:35:17,669 --> 00:35:18,635
Okay.

528
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:19,869
Okay.

529
00:35:24,976 --> 00:35:26,141
Are you alright?

530
00:35:27,345 --> 00:35:28,844
I need to get Kevin.

531
00:35:28,879 --> 00:35:30,346
My partner's with him.

532
00:35:30,381 --> 00:35:31,814
You stay here.

533
00:35:35,152 --> 00:35:36,552
There, okay?!

534
00:35:37,355 --> 00:35:38,554
Yeah.

535
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:54,725
Don't move!

536
00:37:23,087 --> 00:37:24,386
Evening, Mr. Lasalle.

537
00:37:24,422 --> 00:37:26,254
What brings you way out here?

538
00:37:26,623 --> 00:37:27,589
We saw the lights.

539
00:37:27,624 --> 00:37:29,090
We were curious.

540
00:37:29,593 --> 00:37:30,992
You're trespassing.

541
00:37:31,595 --> 00:37:33,238
Private property.

542
00:37:35,098 --> 00:37:36,264
Are we?

543
00:37:39,603 --> 00:37:41,002
Get off your bikes!

544
00:37:42,304 --> 00:37:45,079
Hand over your cell phones!

545
00:38:28,148 --> 00:38:29,715
I need to go home.

546
00:38:38,157 --> 00:38:40,157
I'll get a ride back to the office.

547
00:38:44,163 --> 00:38:45,730
Can I use your phone?

548
00:39:49,592 --> 00:39:51,036
Catherine Hi, you've reached Catherine.

549
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,025
Leave a message,

550
00:39:52,061 --> 00:39:53,359
I'll get back to you when I can.

551
00:39:54,396 --> 00:39:55,596
It's done.

552
00:39:56,231 --> 00:39:57,630
I'm coming home.

553
00:40:01,736 --> 00:40:02,935
I'm done, Cath.

554
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,439
I'm done.

555
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,307
We've got a jumper.

556
00:41:59,513 --> 00:42:01,346
No you can't.

557
00:42:01,381 --> 00:42:02,581
Don't.

558
00:42:43,388 --> 00:42:45,222
Do you doubt that Catherine took
her own life?

559
00:42:45,323 --> 00:42:46,689
I believe I knew my wife.

560
00:42:48,126 --> 00:42:49,258
We have an incident

561
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,559
I want you to take the lead.

562
00:42:50,661 --> 00:42:51,560
He's not ready.

563
00:42:51,662 --> 00:42:52,928
Two victims, one killer.

564
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:54,030
And one survivor.

565
00:42:54,899 --> 00:42:55,976
We need to go to the police.

566
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,066
I'll figure something out.

567
00:42:57,168 --> 00:42:58,333
You don't believe she did it.

568
00:42:58,435 --> 00:42:59,435
That should be enough.

569
00:42:59,536 --> 00:43:00,269
No, it's not!

570
00:43:00,371 --> 00:43:01,670
This is what you are now.

571
00:43:01,773 --> 00:43:03,773
A broken man with power.

572
00:43:03,875 --> 00:43:04,939
Yeah.
