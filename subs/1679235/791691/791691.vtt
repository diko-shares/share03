[engines racing]

3
00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:31.880
[girl] There are times in your life
when you find yourself...

4
00:00:31.982 --> 00:00:35.316
in very awkward situations.

5
00:00:35.417 --> 00:00:37.919
I mean, just look
at that face, Jo.

6
00:00:38.021 --> 00:00:39.821
Abby needs you.

7
00:00:39.922 --> 00:00:41.423
We need you.

8
00:00:41.524 --> 00:00:43.825
And we're willing to pay.

9
00:00:43.926 --> 00:00:46.628
[girl] And this would
be one of those moments.

10
00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:50.849
But I swear, it's not like I'm
selling my kidney or anything.

11
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:53.836
Although, that would
have been less painful.

12
00:00:53.937 --> 00:00:55.937
But I'm getting
ahead of myself.

13
00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.107
Let me start at the beginning.

14
00:00:58.208 --> 00:01:01.244
And it's the big day, the
qualifying race of the Indy 500.

15
00:01:01.345 --> 00:01:03.279
- She takes her position...
- [Jo] This is my dad.

16
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.581
...revs the motor
of her stock car, hoping...

17
00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:09.035
To not crash and burn on
the last lap of adolescence.

18
00:01:09.136 --> 00:01:13.573
- Oh, that's my girl.
- [Jo] Dad built engines for race cars.

19
00:01:13.623 --> 00:01:15.825
And so did I.

20
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.412
Ignore the pigtails.
I was more naive back then.

21
00:01:19.513 --> 00:01:22.315
Because of his work,
I changed schools...

22
00:01:22.416 --> 00:01:26.821
two times a year
for the past eight years.

23
00:01:26.922 --> 00:01:32.141
This doesn't make me a loner with a highly
evolved defense mechanism or anything.

24
00:01:32.242 --> 00:01:34.644
OK, fine, it does.

25
00:01:34.745 --> 00:01:38.432
Today, everything
was about to change.

26
00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:41.001
It was my first day
at North Shore High,

27
00:01:41.102 --> 00:01:44.438
the last stop before
Carnegie Mellon University,

28
00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.206
my dream school.

29
00:01:46.307 --> 00:01:48.876
My rules of survival
were simple:

30
00:01:48.978 --> 00:01:52.680
Don't stand out,
never raise your hand in class...

31
00:01:52.781 --> 00:01:55.649
and watch your back
at all times.

32
00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:56.817
[car engine revving]

33
00:01:57.052 --> 00:02:00.605
New town, same school,
same parking lot.

34
00:02:00.706 --> 00:02:03.874
Everyone obsessed with the
freedom of their first car.

35
00:02:03.975 --> 00:02:08.379
It's an identity, like the muscle cars
who think they own the road,

36
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.015
and check out
every passing vehicle.

37
00:02:13.603 --> 00:02:15.871
- Smart cars who don't fit in.
- [computer dings]

38
00:02:15.972 --> 00:02:19.174
- Whoa!
- The "I'm so perky...

39
00:02:19.175 --> 00:02:21.761
I might shake off my tube top"
cutesy cars.

40
00:02:21.861 --> 00:02:22.861
[horn honks]

41
00:02:22.862 --> 00:02:25.964
And then there's the most
dangerous vehicle on the road,

42
00:02:26.065 --> 00:02:29.635
the high-performance,
high-maintenance sports cars.

43
00:02:29.736 --> 00:02:31.237
[¶ Katy Perry: Hot N Cold]

44
00:02:31.338 --> 00:02:34.140
¶ Like a girl changes clothes ¶

45
00:02:34.241 --> 00:02:37.626
[Jo] If they liked you,
your life was all green lights.

46
00:02:37.727 --> 00:02:39.294
- Hi.
- Hi.

47
00:02:39.396 --> 00:02:40.763
[Jo] If they didn't,

48
00:02:40.864 --> 00:02:43.699
you were nothing more than a
wreck on the side of the road.

49
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.137
¶ That you're not
gonna change ¶

50
00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.190

Then you're cold ¶

51
00:02:51.291 --> 00:02:53.092
¶ You're yes
Then you're no ¶

52
00:02:53.193 --> 00:02:55.795
[Jo] At North Shore,
they were called the Plastics,

53
00:02:55.896 --> 00:02:59.699
and Mandi Weatherly
was the number one Plastic.

54
00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.437
She dotted her name with a
signature heart above the "i".

55
00:03:03.538 --> 00:03:07.407
Probably because she didn't
actually possess that organ.

56
00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:09.810
Her two sidekicks
were Chastity Meyer,

57
00:03:09.911 --> 00:03:14.548
who was stupid enough to hit a home run
with any boy willing to play,

58
00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:17.417
and Hope Plotkin,
uber-hypochondriac,

59
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.621
who believed that germs
led to ugliness,

60
00:03:19.721 --> 00:03:21.656
and ugliness led to death.

61
00:03:21.757 --> 00:03:25.993
And thus, my number one rule
for survival: no girl drama.

62
00:03:26.094 --> 00:03:30.231
- [grunts]
- [Jo] Actually, no drama, period.

63
00:03:30.332 --> 00:03:32.817
Please, please, don't be ruined!

64
00:03:32.918 --> 00:03:36.154
[Jo] And in high school, an already
embarrassing moment can go from bad...

65
00:03:36.255 --> 00:03:37.404
- [boy] Whoa!
- Oh!

66
00:03:37.505 --> 00:03:39.457
[Jo] to worse.

67
00:03:39.558 --> 00:03:42.294
- Are you OK?
- How bad do I look?

68
00:03:42.495 --> 00:03:43.829
[Jo] She couldn't
have looked worse.

69
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.248
- You look great.
- Really? Thanks.

70
00:03:47.583 --> 00:03:49.517
I'm Abby Hanover.
Yeah, you must be new.

71
00:03:49.618 --> 00:03:52.388
I'm part of the welcoming committee.
Well, there's only two of us, really, and...

72
00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.975
and I'd... I'd love
to show you around.

73
00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:59.978
- Are they gone?
- Yeah.

74
00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:05.517
Listen, I think I can find my way
to the front office, thanks. [chuckles]

75
00:04:05.618 --> 00:04:09.271
So, Jo, I see your
dad's big in NASCAR.

76
00:04:09.372 --> 00:04:11.139
Well, let me set
your mind at ease.

77
00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.244
We know how to deal with
celebrities here at North Shore.

78
00:04:15.345 --> 00:04:18.931
One of our lunch ladies was on
the first season of American Idol.

79
00:04:19.132 --> 00:04:21.767
- Good to know.
- Yeah, it was pretty hot.

80
00:04:22.052 --> 00:04:24.905
And, uh... we're also aware
f your many moves.

81
00:04:24.906 --> 00:04:25.805
Okay.

82
00:04:25.806 --> 00:04:28.107
'Cause we're aware that students
who move around a lot...

83
00:04:28.208 --> 00:04:32.178
often wind up as
serial killers or actors.

84
00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:35.265
[chuckles] Hey, did I mention
we have an excellent drama department?

85
00:04:35.366 --> 00:04:36.766
I'm not really into drama,

86
00:04:36.867 --> 00:04:39.537
but I do know you have
an advanced shop class.

87
00:04:39.638 --> 00:04:43.923
Ah, menial laborer
rather than intellectual.

88
00:04:44.024 --> 00:04:45.825
[whispers] I can respect that.

89
00:04:45.926 --> 00:04:48.462
Um, the cheerleading squad

90
00:04:48.647 --> 00:04:52.349
will be going to the public
library for a field trip.

91
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.385
Now, last year, we had
some problems with that,

92
00:04:55.487 --> 00:04:58.188
where we had 12 girls go,

93
00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:00.591
and we had 15 girls come back.

94
00:05:02.361 --> 00:05:03.894
[principal continues] I know
how much you all love vampires,

95
00:05:03.996 --> 00:05:06.497
but remember,
the school nurse will be...

96
00:05:06.598 --> 00:05:10.835
heading up the blood drive,
so sign up for that now.

97
00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:15.756
[grunts]
Home Ec's down the hall, miss.

98
00:05:15.857 --> 00:05:19.027
Actually, as refreshingly
sexist as that is,

99
00:05:19.128 --> 00:05:21.029
I'm here for Advanced Shop.

100
00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.299
- Drafting class.
- [groans] Right.

101
00:05:24.567 --> 00:05:26.868
Well, we lost Mike to that
circular saw incident,

102
00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:29.571
so you can be
Tyler's partner.

103
00:05:29.772 --> 00:05:32.657
OK, everybody, get started
on your birdhouses.

104
00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:35.294
Trusses or triangles,
I don't care.

105
00:05:35.496 --> 00:05:38.880
That's about all
I can deal with right now.

106
00:05:40.033 --> 00:05:42.217
- Hey, Tyler, I'm Jo.
- Hey.

107
00:05:42.318 --> 00:05:45.655
- What's his deal?
- Well, uh, Mr. Giamatti...

108
00:05:45.756 --> 00:05:48.758
bleeds Texas A&M maroon and
white, and they lost Saturday.

109
00:05:48.858 --> 00:05:51.894
Well, if they want to be taken seriously,
they better beat the Longhorns.

110
00:05:51.995 --> 00:05:53.195
Don't let Giamatti hear
you say that...

111
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.949
[Jo] And just
when a guy seems all dreamy...

112
00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.769
and has eyes
you can fall into...

113
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.438
So we have to build
a lame birdhouse. Um...

114
00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:04.274
I guess you could decorate it.

115
00:06:06.093 --> 00:06:08.812
[Jo] He opens his mouth
and sounds like an ass.

116
00:06:08.913 --> 00:06:12.014
Wow, thanks.

117
00:06:13.283 --> 00:06:14.367
But I was thinking I could...

118
00:06:14.468 --> 00:06:16.403
carve the dovetail joint.

119
00:06:16.504 --> 00:06:19.105
- I'm impressed.
- That makes one of us.

120
00:06:19.206 --> 00:06:21.709
[indistinct chatter]

121
00:06:23.445 --> 00:06:26.346
[Jo] In every school,
students have their lunch gang.

122
00:06:26.447 --> 00:06:31.452
As my dad says, your racer is
only as good as your pit crew.

123
00:06:32.521 --> 00:06:34.454
Cutest dog ever, Mandi!

124
00:06:34.556 --> 00:06:37.925
Thanks! Coco Chanel really
sets off my new purse.

125
00:06:38.026 --> 00:06:40.028
You had her checked
for rabies, right?

126
00:06:40.128 --> 00:06:42.630
Too bad you couldn't get the new Prada bag
with the fringe.

127
00:06:42.731 --> 00:06:44.232
Would've totally
matched her brown fur.

128
00:06:44.333 --> 00:06:46.183
Hello! Fringe is so out.

129
00:06:46.284 --> 00:06:50.054
And I'm at the top of the wait list
for the new, patent leather Prada satchel.

130
00:06:50.156 --> 00:06:52.957
But you've already waited, like,
six months for the fringe...

131
00:06:53.058 --> 00:06:55.828
Of course, Mandi,
fringe is so past tense.

132
00:06:55.929 --> 00:06:58.312
Vogue says crimson
is the new accessory,

133
00:06:58.413 --> 00:06:59.914
and you're totally
gonna rock that look.

134
00:07:00.015 --> 00:07:01.899
Oh, I know. [chuckles]

135
00:07:04.303 --> 00:07:05.637
Lost much, little freshies?
Scram.

136
00:07:05.738 --> 00:07:07.872
[boy] Ten dogs in a minute.
Let's do this!

137
00:07:07.973 --> 00:07:09.573
[Tyler] You guys are goin' down.
We're gonna win, come on.

138
00:07:09.674 --> 00:07:12.694
- [boy 2] Yeah. Yeah, let's go, let's go.
- Come on.

139
00:07:12.995 --> 00:07:14.579
- [Tyler] Nick, focus!
- [boy] Come on, man.

140
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.581
Chastity, stop drooling.

141
00:07:16.682 --> 00:07:18.717
You know what Mandi
thinks about you and Tyler.

142
00:07:18.818 --> 00:07:22.054
What are you talking about?

143
00:07:22.155 --> 00:07:24.457
Do not play dumb with me.

144
00:07:24.558 --> 00:07:27.410
I don't have to play dumb.

145
00:07:27.511 --> 00:07:30.496
Besides, the cashier
totally sneezed on your salad.

146
00:07:30.597 --> 00:07:33.165
[gasps] Ew!

147
00:07:33.266 --> 00:07:37.304
[boys continue chattering]

148
00:07:37.438 --> 00:07:39.539
- Ugh!
- Pay up, you two losers.

149
00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.541
- [laughing]
- [grunts, burps]

150
00:07:42.642 --> 00:07:45.011
Ugh, God,
Nick is just so nasty.

151
00:07:45.112 --> 00:07:48.165
I'm only dating him 'cause he's probably
getting a full ride to UCLA.

152
00:07:48.266 --> 00:07:49.699
You know, one week
in LA and I'll be...

153
00:07:49.801 --> 00:07:53.003
a bikini model-hyphen-reality
star-hyphen-awesome!

154
00:07:53.104 --> 00:07:55.705
- I heard Amy Hall is totally into him.
- Oh, she wouldn't dare.

155
00:07:55.806 --> 00:08:00.144
Nickie, over here.
I missed you.

156
00:08:02.046 --> 00:08:05.948
- Hey, babe.
- Hey, have you been lifting weights?

157
00:08:06.049 --> 00:08:08.786
- Oh, dude, your rat-dog just tongued me.
- [dog growls]

158
00:08:08.887 --> 00:08:11.855
Shut up, Nick. You'll hurt
Coco Chanel's feelings.

159
00:08:11.856 --> 00:08:14.942
- Aah!
- No groping south of the equator.

160
00:08:14.943 --> 00:08:18.779
- Or north, creep.
- [boys laughing]

161
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.766
Wow, the hot chick can
really handle herself.

162
00:08:21.867 --> 00:08:25.971
- Wonder what else she can handle.

164
00:08:29.824 --> 00:08:32.827
- Who the hell is she?
- Her name is Jo, Jo Mitchell.

165
00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:34.463
She's in my bio class.

166
00:08:34.564 --> 00:08:37.865
Somebody said she came somewhere,
from, like, Florida or Texas.

167
00:08:37.966 --> 00:08:41.603
Then I also heard that she's
an exchange student from Russia.

168
00:08:41.704 --> 00:08:44.406
Oh, what did they
exchange her for?

169
00:08:46.826 --> 00:08:48.595
She's kinda pretty,
don't you think?

170
00:08:48.696 --> 00:08:52.330
Well, [laughs]
if you're into pleather.

171
00:08:52.431 --> 00:08:55.117
[Abby] Hello, there.
Hi, Coco Chanel.

172
00:08:55.218 --> 00:09:00.572
Go back to Mandi, go on.
Go, go, go.

173
00:09:00.707 --> 00:09:03.208
- All right, just a little bit.
- [dog yipping]

174
00:09:05.563 --> 00:09:08.014
- [growls]
- [Mandi] Where's Coco Chanel?

175
00:09:08.031 --> 00:09:09.948
[barking]

176
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.168
Bad little girl.

177
00:09:15.355 --> 00:09:18.241
- [sighs]
- [cell phone rings]

178
00:09:18.342 --> 00:09:20.610
- [dog vomits, barks]
- [gasps]

179
00:09:20.711 --> 00:09:24.564
[gasping]
Oh, my God! Who did that?

180
00:09:24.665 --> 00:09:27.016
- Who fed Coco Chanel?
- [girl] It was Abby.

181
00:09:27.117 --> 00:09:30.404
- [boy] Abby did it.
- You? Again?

182
00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:35.959
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
I'm really sorry, Mandi!

183
00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:37.961
I'll buy you another purse.

184
00:09:38.062 --> 00:09:39.730
Or you can just have mine.

185
00:09:39.831 --> 00:09:41.498
Is that what I think it is?

186
00:09:41.599 --> 00:09:44.418
- Uh-oh, duck.
- I love ducks.

187
00:09:44.519 --> 00:09:47.354
It's, um,
the Prada fringe purse.

188
00:09:47.455 --> 00:09:50.040
My dad got it for me
last month, but...

189
00:09:50.141 --> 00:09:54.362
Last month? Ugh, just go!

190
00:09:55.931 --> 00:09:59.466
- [grunts] Aah!
- [all] Oh!

191
00:09:59.567 --> 00:10:02.687
Stay down there,
and don't ever look at me again.

192
00:10:02.788 --> 00:10:06.541
Better yet, don't even
breathe the same air.

193
00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:14.615
[dog whimpering, barking]

194
00:10:24.527 --> 00:10:28.064
Hey. Well, how was it?

195
00:10:28.165 --> 00:10:31.315
I saw a girl become
roadkill in the cafeteria.

196
00:10:31.417 --> 00:10:33.118
Gotta love high school.

197
00:10:33.219 --> 00:10:36.556
Speaking of my escape, has my
Carnegie Mellon application arrived?

198
00:10:36.657 --> 00:10:38.240
Hey, you know,
I was lookin' today,

199
00:10:38.341 --> 00:10:42.077
and I saw that the University of Ohio
has a great architectural program.

200
00:10:42.178 --> 00:10:44.046
You could stay close to home,

201
00:10:44.147 --> 00:10:48.685
transform Toledo into an
architectural wonderland.

202
00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.087
Dad, what's going on?

203
00:10:51.188 --> 00:10:53.756
I'm applying early decision
to Carnegie Mellon.

204
00:10:53.857 --> 00:10:55.624
Eh, what do you wanna
go there for, huh?

205
00:10:55.725 --> 00:10:59.128
They don't even have a good mascot.
I mean, a Scottish terrier.

206
00:10:59.229 --> 00:11:00.697
Who's gonna be
intimidated by that?

207
00:11:00.798 --> 00:11:03.083
Plus, you, uh...

208
00:11:03.184 --> 00:11:06.119
You qualify
for in-state tuition here.

209
00:11:07.004 --> 00:11:08.688
Oh, my God.

210
00:11:08.789 --> 00:11:10.841
What happened to my tuition?!

211
00:11:12.961 --> 00:11:17.648
Aw, Jo...
Look, I'm sorry.

212
00:11:17.749 --> 00:11:19.983
I kept hoping that
the market would rebound,

213
00:11:20.084 --> 00:11:23.471
but my investments are in the tank,
and now NASCAR sponsors have cut spending...

214
00:11:23.572 --> 00:11:26.407
Then make them
un-cut spending!

215
00:11:26.508 --> 00:11:29.043
Mom went to Carnegie Mellon,
I... I have to go there.

216
00:11:29.144 --> 00:11:32.480
- She loved it!
- I know, I know.

217
00:11:32.581 --> 00:11:34.565
I'm sorry I let you down.

218
00:11:36.451 --> 00:11:41.055
I know you're disappointed,
Jo, and that's OK.

219
00:11:42.791 --> 00:11:45.294
Honey, you don't always
have to be so strong.

220
00:11:46.896 --> 00:11:50.331
[Jo] Strong?
I was trying not to panic.

221
00:11:50.432 --> 00:11:52.600
But when you've moved
as much as I have,

222
00:11:52.701 --> 00:11:57.673
you kinda get attached to the idea
of settling down in one place for 4 years.

223
00:11:57.774 --> 00:12:01.310
In this case,
my mother's alma mater.

224
00:12:01.411 --> 00:12:05.648
My dad and I have been
on our own for a long time.

225
00:12:05.749 --> 00:12:07.616
My mom died before I was one.

226
00:12:07.717 --> 00:12:12.921
So life wasn't exactly your typical warm
and fuzzy greeting card.

227
00:12:13.022 --> 00:12:17.360
But I wasn't the only one
in my own personal hell.

228
00:12:17.527 --> 00:12:21.014
Abby was hoping that her
swollen, black ankle...

229
00:12:21.115 --> 00:12:25.935
might be enough for Mandi to forget
about her dog's infamous upchuck.

230
00:12:29.273 --> 00:12:30.540
And it might have been,

231
00:12:30.641 --> 00:12:34.177
if not for the
two's long history.

232
00:12:35.746 --> 00:12:37.713
Jealousy is a funny thing.

233
00:12:37.814 --> 00:12:40.516
They had lived across
from each other for years.

234
00:12:40.751 --> 00:12:44.521
And while Mandi, seemingly,
had everything,

235
00:12:44.622 --> 00:12:46.605
Abby had more.
She had two parents...

236
00:12:46.706 --> 00:12:49.860
who went a little overboard
for their darling Abby.

237
00:12:49.961 --> 00:12:54.265
First, there was the infamous
moon bounce war at age five.

238
00:12:54.366 --> 00:12:56.617
Mandi's was cool,

239
00:12:56.718 --> 00:12:59.470
but Abby's
was three stories high.

240
00:12:59.571 --> 00:13:02.005
Yay!

241
00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:06.027
[Jo] Then, the French Revolution
Halloween meltdown...

242
00:13:06.179 --> 00:13:07.479
at age 11.

243
00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:10.847
Mandi flaunted her
store-bought peasant costume,

244
00:13:10.948 --> 00:13:13.885
until she spotted Abby's
utterly perfect,

245
00:13:13.986 --> 00:13:17.772
hand-stitched,
Marie Antoinette royal gown.

246
00:13:20.592 --> 00:13:25.130
And finally, the great bra
incident of junior high.

247
00:13:25.231 --> 00:13:27.032
- Hi, Mandi.
- Hi.

248
00:13:27.133 --> 00:13:30.836
[Jo] Well, that had more
to do with nature.

249
00:13:31.037 --> 00:13:34.222
Still, Mandi might have
found someone else to hate,

250
00:13:34.323 --> 00:13:38.127
if Abby hadn't
done the unthinkable.

251
00:13:41.231 --> 00:13:44.432
Mandi, oh, my God! Someone has
a better parking space than us.

252
00:13:44.533 --> 00:13:47.987
Hey, babe, who snagged
the plush disabled spot?

253
00:13:48.088 --> 00:13:49.889
I guess you're number two now.

254
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:52.625
Two? Two?

255
00:13:52.726 --> 00:13:55.744
[Jo] Mandi hated
being number two.

256
00:13:58.065 --> 00:14:02.402
- This is war.
- Oh, God.

257
00:14:05.639 --> 00:14:08.190
- Elliot, we need a little favor.
- Sure.

258
00:14:08.291 --> 00:14:11.361
- Chastity.
- [groans softly]

259
00:14:11.663 --> 00:14:15.115
- Hey.
- Anything.

260
00:14:15.316 --> 00:14:17.282
- You're on the Web team, right?
- Of course.

261
00:14:17.383 --> 00:14:19.435
Trained in Java and C++.

262
00:14:19.537 --> 00:14:22.038
I also have my Math Club Card,
Hacker Membership, Journalist Pass,

263
00:14:22.139 --> 00:14:27.343
- and I do a little salsa for the ladies.
- Oh!

264
00:14:27.444 --> 00:14:28.912
How can I be of service?

265
00:14:29.914 --> 00:14:34.202
- Oops.
- [laughter]

266
00:14:34.303 --> 00:14:37.972
- Sorry.
- Oh, gross!

267
00:14:38.073 --> 00:14:42.510
Abby Scabby's face looks as red
and pussy as it did in seventh grade.

268
00:14:42.611 --> 00:14:44.278
Zit cream much?

269
00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:48.716
[Jo] Mandi was creative,
ruthless, unrelenting.

270
00:14:48.818 --> 00:14:53.137
- I'd seen her kind before.
- Need a napkin?

271
00:14:59.312 --> 00:15:02.981
[Jo] And this was
just the beginning.

272
00:15:03.082 --> 00:15:05.616
[cell phone rings]

273
00:15:05.717 --> 00:15:07.519
Brutal.

274
00:15:12.192 --> 00:15:16.328
You know, most girls would have laughed,
texted back or posted a status update.

275
00:15:16.429 --> 00:15:18.530
Do I look like most girls?

276
00:15:18.631 --> 00:15:22.335
[school bell rings]

277
00:15:22.436 --> 00:15:25.270
- [thudding]
- [laughing]

278
00:15:29.325 --> 00:15:30.960
Oh, God.

279
00:15:31.462 --> 00:15:33.229
[boy] What a paint job!

280
00:15:36.616 --> 00:15:39.085
[laughter continues]

281
00:15:40.004 --> 00:15:42.071
Need another one?

282
00:15:49.146 --> 00:15:51.447
Hey, Abby, let me
give you a ride home.

283
00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:53.717
I don't bite.

284
00:16:06.114 --> 00:16:09.249
- Nice house.
- Thanks.

285
00:16:16.641 --> 00:16:20.694
Abby? Honey, what's wrong?

286
00:16:35.744 --> 00:16:39.113
- May I help you?
- Oh, hi.

287
00:16:39.215 --> 00:16:42.884
I gave Abby a ride home from
school, and she dropped this.

288
00:16:42.985 --> 00:16:45.287
What happened to Abby's car?
Did she have an accident?

289
00:16:45.388 --> 00:16:47.355
She had an accident,
didn't she? Was she hurt?

290
00:16:47.456 --> 00:16:51.360
No, it wasn't an accident.
It was just some girls at school.

291
00:16:51.461 --> 00:16:54.862
Again? I knew we should have
sent her to St. Mary's.

292
00:16:54.963 --> 00:16:59.402
Right. Well, tell Abby,
Jo said goodbye.

293
00:17:04.174 --> 00:17:05.406
She's a wreck.

294
00:17:05.507 --> 00:17:08.443
Our poor baby, she keeps saying
that everybody hates her.

295
00:17:08.712 --> 00:17:11.214
I'll buy her some new clothes,
a week at a spa.

296
00:17:11.315 --> 00:17:13.800
Money's not gonna
fix this, Sidney.

297
00:17:13.901 --> 00:17:17.737
She's sobbing her eyes out,
and I don't know what to do.

298
00:17:17.838 --> 00:17:20.640
If only she had some friends.

299
00:17:33.071 --> 00:17:34.872
Listen, Jo, she's devastated.

300
00:17:34.973 --> 00:17:38.641
But it's her senior year,
and I want it to be perfect.

301
00:17:38.743 --> 00:17:40.911
I mean,
just look at that face.

302
00:17:41.012 --> 00:17:43.046
She needs you. We need you.

303
00:17:43.147 --> 00:17:44.714
And we're willing to pay.

304
00:17:44.815 --> 00:17:48.736
- What?
- For you to be her friend.

305
00:17:48.838 --> 00:17:52.006
Two, three, 4,000
to get you started.

306
00:17:52.107 --> 00:17:54.291
- You're crazy.
- Wait, please.

307
00:17:54.392 --> 00:17:56.827
I have more money
than I know what to do with.

308
00:17:56.928 --> 00:17:59.597
And if I can't buy my daughter's happiness,
then what is it worth?

309
00:17:59.698 --> 00:18:03.818
- You can't buy friends.
- OK. Don't call it a friend.

310
00:18:03.919 --> 00:18:09.057
Call it her bodyguard,
guardian angel, fairy god-sister.

311
00:18:10.008 --> 00:18:11.977
There must be
something you want.

312
00:18:12.078 --> 00:18:14.312
Some dream I can
help come true.

313
00:18:14.413 --> 00:18:18.583
A new car?
A trip to Europe? College?

314
00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:22.772
College.

315
00:18:22.873 --> 00:18:25.756
Today's economy,
it's rough out there.

316
00:18:25.857 --> 00:18:30.546
You need money for college,
and it isn't cheap.

317
00:18:30.647 --> 00:18:32.298
- Let me pay for yours.
- Forget it.

318
00:18:32.399 --> 00:18:34.933
Look, just try it out
for 30 days, risk-free.

319
00:18:35.034 --> 00:18:37.202
I guarantee you'll
be happy you did.

320
00:18:37.303 --> 00:18:40.639
And just for trying, I'll buy your
college books for freshman year,

321
00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:45.361
which are yours to keep, no questions asked,
as my little gift to you.

322
00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:49.497
[Jo] Sidney
was pretty convincing,

323
00:18:49.599 --> 00:18:51.667
and I should have
realized why.

324
00:18:51.769 --> 00:18:54.470
He was the king
of infomercials.

325
00:18:54.571 --> 00:18:58.006
He could sell anything from
meat juicers to cat toilets...

326
00:18:58.108 --> 00:19:00.009
to my college tuition.

327
00:19:00.111 --> 00:19:01.611
I knew it was crazy.

328
00:19:01.712 --> 00:19:03.880
But Abby'd have
a good senior year,

329
00:19:03.981 --> 00:19:08.252
and I'd get my dream of
Carnegie Mellon University.

330
00:19:09.553 --> 00:19:12.756
I figured, who would it hurt?

331
00:19:12.857 --> 00:19:14.140
[pop music plays]

332
00:19:14.241 --> 00:19:15.676
Four hundred people
already viewed it.

333
00:19:15.777 --> 00:19:18.061
That computer geek
lived up to his promise.

334
00:19:18.162 --> 00:19:21.514
Which is like a rarity in life,
that anyone ever comes through.

335
00:19:21.615 --> 00:19:23.449
Especially fathers and doctors.

336
00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:25.853
Not my legs,
Chastity, my face.

337
00:19:25.954 --> 00:19:30.090
I'm getting all
red and splotchy. Ugh.

338
00:19:30.191 --> 00:19:31.592
- Uh-oh.
- What?

339
00:19:31.693 --> 00:19:34.244
You're never
gonna believe this.

340
00:19:34.345 --> 00:19:35.546
What do you mean?

341
00:19:35.647 --> 00:19:38.582
Someone posted a link on
your page to another video.

342
00:19:38.683 --> 00:19:42.787
Look, it's that new girl, Jo.
She totally bailed Abby out.

343
00:19:42.888 --> 00:19:47.057
Ugh, who is this girl?
Some bad-ass biker chick?

344
00:19:47.159 --> 00:19:50.412
- There's tons of comments.
- [Mandi] Ugh.

345
00:19:50.513 --> 00:19:55.149
- All the guys think she's hot.
- OK.

346
00:19:56.352 --> 00:19:58.119
So she's hot.

347
00:19:58.221 --> 00:20:00.088
She's well-connected.

348
00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:02.658
I mean, she's
pretty much one of us.

349
00:20:02.758 --> 00:20:04.927
So we'll just need
to make it very clear that,

350
00:20:05.028 --> 00:20:08.463
from here on out, she's only
nice to the people we like.

351
00:20:08.565 --> 00:20:11.917
- Agreed?
- [machine revving]

352
00:20:17.556 --> 00:20:20.193
Mandi, can I get a quote
from you on the school play,

353
00:20:20.294 --> 00:20:22.395
or the lacrosse team, or just,
like, anything, really?

354
00:20:22.496 --> 00:20:25.898
God, I am not up for the
paparazzi this morning.

355
00:20:29.036 --> 00:20:31.721
It's so embarrassing
how much they love me.

356
00:20:31.822 --> 00:20:35.124
I'm Mandi, with an "i".
And you're Jo, right?

357
00:20:35.225 --> 00:20:37.694
- That's me.
- So, Jo, since you're new here,

358
00:20:37.795 --> 00:20:40.947
I thought we'd help you out,
let you know who to hang out with.

359
00:20:41.147 --> 00:20:43.468
- Us.
- [Jo] The real welcoming committee...

360
00:20:43.469 --> 00:20:44.369
had arrived.

361
00:20:44.669 --> 00:20:47.805
- And who not to.
- [Jo] Did I say "welcoming?"

362
00:20:47.906 --> 00:20:51.874
Uh, oh, wow.

363
00:20:51.976 --> 00:20:53.510
Thanks.

364
00:20:53.612 --> 00:20:56.313
But I think I can
figure that out on my own.

365
00:20:56.414 --> 00:21:00.685
Really? Well, I... I haven't
been impressed so far.

366
00:21:00.786 --> 00:21:03.520
- [Jo] Excuse me?
- But I'm a benevolent dictator,

367
00:21:03.621 --> 00:21:08.310
so why don't we discuss over a non-fat,
no-sugar raspberry Frappuccino...

368
00:21:08.411 --> 00:21:10.945
- at the coffee joint?
- We only use Skinny-and-Sweet.

369
00:21:11.047 --> 00:21:13.313
It's like cellulite in a straw,
but without the cellulite.

370
00:21:13.415 --> 00:21:16.082
As scientifically interesting
as that sounds,

371
00:21:16.183 --> 00:21:17.502
I'll have to pass.

372
00:21:17.603 --> 00:21:21.055
Oh, it wasn't a question.
[chuckles]

373
00:21:21.156 --> 00:21:24.559
Oops. Guess I answered anyway.

374
00:21:27.063 --> 00:21:28.079
Oh, my God. Hi.

375
00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:30.815
I'm Quinn Shinn,
editor of the school paper.

376
00:21:30.916 --> 00:21:34.853
That was unbelievable.
Nobody turns Mandi down.

377
00:21:34.955 --> 00:21:38.323
- I just didn't feel like going.
- You're kidding, right?

378
00:21:38.424 --> 00:21:42.428
No, the Plastics are goddesses.
And Mandi can, like, ruin you.

379
00:21:42.528 --> 00:21:44.763
I wrote one article
on school uniforms,

380
00:21:44.864 --> 00:21:47.531
and she put strawberries
in my yogurt.

381
00:21:47.632 --> 00:21:49.468
How horrible for you?

382
00:21:49.569 --> 00:21:52.204
Oh, I had an allergic reaction
to the strawberries,

383
00:21:52.305 --> 00:21:56.508
swelled up like a big Arothron
hispidus. That's a blowfish.

384
00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:59.011
Be careful, Jo.

385
00:21:59.112 --> 00:22:02.514
Thanks, but I'm
not that worried.

386
00:22:10.306 --> 00:22:11.990
[Jo] Hey, what's up?

387
00:22:12.091 --> 00:22:15.094
So you dropped your notebook,
but I gave it back to your dad.

388
00:22:15.195 --> 00:22:17.898
Pretty cool sketches.
Are you an artist?

389
00:22:17.999 --> 00:22:22.035
[stammering] Look, it's cool, I get it.
You don't have to...

390
00:22:22.236 --> 00:22:25.289
- Get what?
- Principal Duvall sent you.

391
00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:28.708
But look, the welcoming committee
was just a stupid idea.

392
00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:31.129
I mean, really, you're the first
new student here in ages,

393
00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:33.529
so you're off the hook.

394
00:22:33.631 --> 00:22:36.549
- Thanks for the ride, though.
- Sure.

395
00:22:40.422 --> 00:22:44.591
Registration
for AP test has closed.

396
00:22:44.692 --> 00:22:46.660
Now...

397
00:22:46.762 --> 00:22:49.630
Uh, now, we all know the
tradition here at North Shore...

398
00:22:49.731 --> 00:22:54.169
is to, uh, use
the Homecoming Dance...

399
00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:58.639
to fund-raise
for charity, okay?

400
00:23:01.544 --> 00:23:03.112
'Cause otherwise you all
would just think...

401
00:23:03.213 --> 00:23:05.813
the world revolves around
you and football.

402
00:23:05.914 --> 00:23:09.368
And it doesn't, OK?

403
00:23:09.469 --> 00:23:10.985
I told you not to walk
in front of...

404
00:23:11.087 --> 00:23:13.488
Babe, I already chose your
tuxedo, rented the limo and...

405
00:23:13.589 --> 00:23:16.525
Oh, red rose corsage,
not a frigging carnation.

406
00:23:16.825 --> 00:23:18.995
Mandi, you are so winning
Homecoming Queen.

407
00:23:18.996 --> 00:23:19.996
Totally winning.

408
00:23:20.796 --> 00:23:23.698
[Duvall] The school nurse
will be heading up the blood drive,

409
00:23:23.799 --> 00:23:25.901
- so sign up for that now.
- [laughs] Please.

410
00:23:26.002 --> 00:23:30.338
Like I'm letting that petri dish
of a clinic stick a needle in me.

411
00:23:30.606 --> 00:23:33.174
[girl] I know!
And no matter what I said...

412
00:23:33.277 --> 00:23:36.113
Hey, uh... do you know
where I could catch the bus?

413
00:23:36.114 --> 00:23:37.814
I think it just left.

414
00:23:37.914 --> 00:23:41.417
Classic. This is why I really
need to fix my bike today.

415
00:23:41.518 --> 00:23:45.688
Do you know any good auto parts shops?
I've gotta get a new spark plug.

416
00:23:45.789 --> 00:23:50.093
Well, I... I think there's Pete's Auto
right next to the coffee joint.

417
00:23:50.194 --> 00:23:52.128
I could give you
a ride if you want.

418
00:23:52.229 --> 00:23:54.731
I mean, I really
owe you one anyway.

419
00:23:54.831 --> 00:23:56.966
Sweet, thanks.

420
00:24:04.625 --> 00:24:06.343
Oh, look, it's Jo!
Hey, Jo!

421
00:24:06.511 --> 00:24:11.615
- Hey.
- She's with Abby Hanover!

422
00:24:11.716 --> 00:24:13.467
Hi.

423
00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:32.787
[Jo] Thanks for the lift.

424
00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:36.256
Do you wanna come inside?

425
00:24:36.357 --> 00:24:40.462
I'll probably break something,
but... but sure.

426
00:24:47.786 --> 00:24:51.956
- Who's that?
- Um, my mom.

427
00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:55.694
She's really pretty.

428
00:24:58.664 --> 00:25:01.599
Yeah. She was.

429
00:25:05.021 --> 00:25:08.640
- What are these?
- Um...

430
00:25:08.742 --> 00:25:12.728
That's the Sydney Harbor Bridge
and a skyscraper I've been designing.

431
00:25:12.829 --> 00:25:15.781
Kind of hard to tell,
I'm a crappy artist.

432
00:25:15.882 --> 00:25:18.502
- I could help, if you want.
- Really?

433
00:25:18.786 --> 00:25:22.471
Uh, you're pretty talented,
based on those sketches I saw.

434
00:25:22.572 --> 00:25:24.690
You should see
my paintings sometime.

435
00:25:24.791 --> 00:25:27.561
Uh, actually, you don't have to.
It's a bad idea...

436
00:25:27.662 --> 00:25:30.947
No, that'd be really cool.

437
00:25:31.215 --> 00:25:34.584
OK. You ready to
go change a spark plug?

438
00:25:34.736 --> 00:25:39.305
[rhythm and blues
plays on radio]

439
00:25:42.277 --> 00:25:45.745
My gosh,
is that a friend?

440
00:25:45.846 --> 00:25:47.447
Maybe you were right.

441
00:25:47.548 --> 00:25:50.184
Girls aren't
so bad after all.

442
00:25:51.787 --> 00:25:54.422
Hello, Mr. Winkle!

443
00:25:54.523 --> 00:25:58.843
Are those illegal parts? I'll bet
you're running a chop shop over there.

444
00:25:58.944 --> 00:26:02.813
Well, I've installed security cameras,
and I'll be watching you.

445
00:26:02.914 --> 00:26:07.201
- You hear?
- Goodbye, Mr. Winkle.

446
00:26:21.133 --> 00:26:25.270
Jo Mitchell, you have
no idea how scary I can be.

447
00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:39.635
Hey, Abby! How are you?

448
00:26:39.736 --> 00:26:42.555
- Ah!
- [laughter]

449
00:26:42.656 --> 00:26:45.457
- I can't get up!
- Are you all right?

450
00:26:45.559 --> 00:26:48.228
I don't know.
Pull me as hard as you can.

451
00:26:48.329 --> 00:26:49.429
OK.

452
00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:51.930
[grunting]

453
00:26:54.735 --> 00:26:57.820
- Now what?
- Uh, help me up.

454
00:26:57.921 --> 00:26:59.755
OK.

455
00:27:01.425 --> 00:27:04.827
[Jo] Seriously? Who would ever
think of something so childish,

456
00:27:04.928 --> 00:27:08.832
yet brilliant,
except a bunch of mean girls?

457
00:27:09.967 --> 00:27:12.419
- [boy] Hey, Mandi.
- [Mandi] Hi.

458
00:27:15.572 --> 00:27:16.793
Now, what do we do?

459
00:27:16.994 --> 00:27:19.594
[Jo] I would've strangled her
right there...

460
00:27:19.694 --> 00:27:20.978
Meet me in the bathroom.

461
00:27:21.079 --> 00:27:23.280
Bring any spare clothes
that you have.

462
00:27:23.381 --> 00:27:26.049
[Jo] if I could get off the Vespa.

463
00:27:27.852 --> 00:27:31.188
Wow. Bad-ass!

464
00:27:31.289 --> 00:27:34.125
- So cool.
- [rock music plays]

465
00:27:34.226 --> 00:27:35.894
Coming through!

466
00:27:38.463 --> 00:27:40.130
Sorry!

467
00:27:41.366 --> 00:27:42.666
[girl] Are you okay?

468
00:27:44.203 --> 00:27:45.353
This is all my fault.

469
00:27:45.454 --> 00:27:46.955
You should've never
hung out with me.

470
00:27:47.056 --> 00:27:48.723
Mandi's gonna make
your life a living hell.

471
00:27:48.824 --> 00:27:50.457
Abby, you can't live in fear.

472
00:27:50.558 --> 00:27:54.129
- Did you find me something to wear?
- Just my art smock.

473
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:56.732
[Jo] That'll have to do.
Thanks.

474
00:27:58.801 --> 00:28:02.437
- Do you need my help?
- I think I got it.

475
00:28:04.107 --> 00:28:06.141
- How do I look?
- Great.

476
00:28:06.242 --> 00:28:09.728
- [yells on screen]
- [laughter]

477
00:28:09.829 --> 00:28:11.863
- Hey, nice look.
- It's not funny.

478
00:28:11.964 --> 00:28:16.001
- I'm not joking, it's hot.
- Thanks.

479
00:28:21.108 --> 00:28:24.210
[Duvall on PA] No unauthorized videos
of my students on the monitor.

480
00:28:24.711 --> 00:28:25.814
[Jo] By the next day,

481
00:28:25.815 --> 00:28:29.014
I hoped everyone would've forgotten
about my wardrobe malfunction,

482
00:28:29.015 --> 00:28:31.101
but it wasn't
what I was expecting.

483
00:28:31.202 --> 00:28:36.255
Apparently, holding your head high
after a Mandi vendetta earned you points.

484
00:28:45.482 --> 00:28:49.836
- Oh, my gosh, this is so cool!
- You started it.

485
00:28:49.938 --> 00:28:51.955
It was your smock.

486
00:28:55.727 --> 00:28:58.545
- It's cute.
- It's pathetic.

487
00:28:58.646 --> 00:29:03.350
I could smear paint all over my Versace,
but I have taste, style.

488
00:29:03.452 --> 00:29:05.236
They're just sheep.

489
00:29:05.337 --> 00:29:09.356
Chastity, make out with the student intern
in the front office, get Jo's file.

490
00:29:09.457 --> 00:29:11.359
Hope, stalk her.

491
00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:13.628
I want to know everything.

492
00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:15.730
[scoffs]

493
00:29:25.841 --> 00:29:27.742
Wow, this is amazing.

494
00:29:27.811 --> 00:29:30.711
You shouldn't waste your
talent on sketches for me.

495
00:29:30.813 --> 00:29:33.314
Oh, I don't mind.

496
00:29:33.415 --> 00:29:34.566
All right, what
should we work on first?

497
00:29:34.667 --> 00:29:37.319
Um, well, I love
building cars with my dad,

498
00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:41.756
but I wanna... I wanna design something
more lasting and permanent.

499
00:29:41.857 --> 00:29:45.694
I.M. Pei, for instance,

666
00:38:22.262 --> 00:38:24.163
Hope, what else do we
have on the Virgin Queen?

667
00:38:24.264 --> 00:38:28.469
Well, a 4.5 GPA, high SATs,
three AP classes and...

668
00:38:28.503 --> 00:38:31.087
Oh, she's applying for
architecture scholarships.

669
00:38:31.188 --> 00:38:34.807
Her dream,
Carnegie Mellon University.

670
00:38:34.909 --> 00:38:38.462
- Hm.
- OK, so one more time.

671
00:38:38.563 --> 00:38:43.166
She's never made out
with anyone... ever?

672
00:38:43.267 --> 00:38:45.268
Or this week?

673
00:38:47.422 --> 00:38:49.723
Hey, not so fast.

674
00:38:49.824 --> 00:38:52.160
Uh, today's your lucky day.
We got a sale going on.

675
00:38:52.261 --> 00:38:55.896
- 20 percent off all grade changes.
- Look, just leave me alone.

676
00:38:55.997 --> 00:38:58.698
Look, I'm just trying
to say I'm sorry, OK?

677
00:38:58.799 --> 00:39:00.701
I was clouded by lust.

678
00:39:00.802 --> 00:39:05.705
And if it helps, I got kicked off
the Web team for abuse of power.

679
00:39:05.806 --> 00:39:07.609
You're still a jerk.

680
00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:10.612
At least your shirt's funny.

681
00:39:18.621 --> 00:39:22.991
Nice fight in the cafeteria.
I could smell the testosterone.

682
00:39:23.092 --> 00:39:24.543
Does this mean I'm forgiven?

683
00:39:24.644 --> 00:39:28.179
Well, it's not your fault that
your dad married Mandi's mom.

684
00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:32.167
But next time, warn me
that you live with Mandi...

685
00:39:32.268 --> 00:39:34.670
in a totally platonic way.

686
00:39:34.771 --> 00:39:37.673
Wait, you thought...?

687
00:39:37.774 --> 00:39:39.508
Dude, gross!

688
00:39:39.609 --> 00:39:42.278
[Jo] But despite Quinn
and Abby's urging,

689
00:39:42.379 --> 00:39:44.781
I refused to stoop
to Mandi's level.

690
00:39:44.882 --> 00:39:50.286
Besides, I was having so much fun
with my new friends, I almost didn't care.

691
00:39:50.387 --> 00:39:52.155
You coming?

692
00:39:53.991 --> 00:39:57.261
Who are those girls?
Do they even go to our school?

693
00:39:57.361 --> 00:39:59.163
I was just looking
at the Homecoming Web site,

694
00:39:59.264 --> 00:40:01.164
and everybody's talking
about the hot, new couple.

695
00:40:01.265 --> 00:40:04.768
Nick and I are the
hottest couple in school.

696
00:40:04.869 --> 00:40:07.004
Not anymore.

697
00:40:18.315 --> 00:40:21.318
[Jo] So this was it,
the first challenge.

698
00:40:21.419 --> 00:40:23.370
Success was worth 100 points,

699
00:40:23.471 --> 00:40:28.142
and I needed every point I could get
to qualify for the scholarship.

700
00:40:30.161 --> 00:40:34.263
Boiled egg in the structure.
No breaks, no bruises.

701
00:40:35.333 --> 00:40:37.652
- Ready?
- Ready.

702
00:40:37.753 --> 00:40:40.538
And... drop!

703
00:40:44.528 --> 00:40:47.228
[Giamatti] OK, who
switched the eggs?

704
00:40:47.329 --> 00:40:50.265
Who? No one?

705
00:40:54.504 --> 00:40:58.055
Oh, well. Who's next?

706
00:40:58.156 --> 00:41:02.260
[Jo] Mandi had found a new part
of my life to destroy:

707
00:41:02.362 --> 00:41:05.597
my chance at the
Thomson-Bird scholarship.

708
00:41:05.898 --> 00:41:08.534
Our next experiment
didn't go much better.

709
00:41:08.835 --> 00:41:11.287
- You ready?
- Yeah.

710
00:41:13.723 --> 00:41:15.641
Hope called her doctor
on speed dial

711
00:41:15.742 --> 00:41:19.645
and switched our CO2
for laughing gas.

712
00:41:26.887 --> 00:41:28.955
[all] Whoa!

713
00:41:38.348 --> 00:41:40.751
Hey, guys, I'm here.

714
00:41:40.852 --> 00:41:43.019
Seriously, Chastity?

715
00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:45.655
I said "incognito",
not "like a flamingo"!

716
00:41:45.756 --> 00:41:48.492
- Oh.
- Go.

717
00:41:53.463 --> 00:41:56.750
Ew! Ew! Ew! There's poo
on my Jimmy Choo!

718
00:41:56.851 --> 00:41:58.452
Shake it off, shake it off.

719
00:41:58.870 --> 00:42:00.888
Go, slow.

720
00:42:02.090 --> 00:42:03.323
Faster!

721
00:42:07.796 --> 00:42:09.697
Uh, I can't go any further.

722
00:42:09.798 --> 00:42:12.232
What is the matter with you?

723
00:42:21.894 --> 00:42:23.328
Funnel.

724
00:42:24.196 --> 00:42:25.831
The funnel!

725
00:42:25.931 --> 00:42:28.366
- Oh, there you go.
- Right. Secret weapon?

726
00:42:28.468 --> 00:42:32.103
- Oh!
- Hope, a fanny pack, never OK.

727
00:42:48.055 --> 00:42:49.388
Coffee?

728
00:43:03.354 --> 00:43:04.720
Perfect.

729
00:43:21.956 --> 00:43:27.711
- Dad, what's going on?
- It's ruined.

730
00:43:27.812 --> 00:43:30.647
- The whole motor is gummed up.
- What? What happened?

731
00:43:30.748 --> 00:43:34.418
- It was running perfectly yesterday.
- I don't know.

732
00:43:34.519 --> 00:43:38.238
I don't know, maybe
it's the fuel, a faulty part.

733
00:43:38.339 --> 00:43:42.226
It doesn't matter because Jimmy and the
boys are expecting a trial run tomorrow.

734
00:43:43.228 --> 00:43:44.712
Dad...

735
00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:47.547
We can figure something out.

736
00:43:47.648 --> 00:43:50.901
There's not enough time,
and there's not enough money.

737
00:43:52.404 --> 00:43:57.142
Maybe I can call in a favor,
uh, beg for an extension,

738
00:43:57.243 --> 00:43:59.844
tell 'em it was some kind of
fluke accident, I don't know.

739
00:44:20.682 --> 00:44:24.136
[Jo] But this was
definitely no accident.

740
00:44:24.237 --> 00:44:26.838
Mandi had gone too far.

741
00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:28.607
Mess with me, fine.

742
00:44:28.708 --> 00:44:31.410
Mess with my family...

743
00:44:31.511 --> 00:44:33.662
...you're dead.

744
00:44:33.763 --> 00:44:38.068
It was as if all my girl hormones
had kicked into overdrive,

745
00:44:38.169 --> 00:44:41.071
and I was out for blood.

746
00:44:41.172 --> 00:44:42.387
The Plastics were going down,

747
00:44:42.488 --> 00:44:46.426
and I didn't care
what rules I had to break...

748
00:44:46.527 --> 00:44:48.462
to make her pay.

749
00:44:52.149 --> 00:44:55.151
- What happened?
- Mandi happened.

750
00:44:58.055 --> 00:44:59.272
Is that all you got?

751
00:44:59.373 --> 00:45:03.711
Going after my dad,
you spoiled, narcissistic bitch!

752
00:45:03.812 --> 00:45:07.614
That's his job,
not some play-toy for you!

753
00:45:07.715 --> 00:45:10.017
- But it was so much fun.
- [chuckles]

754
00:45:10.118 --> 00:45:14.222
The way I figure it, no job,
no income, no house, no JoJo.

755
00:45:14.323 --> 00:45:18.142
- Right?
- I don't run away that easy.

756
00:45:18.243 --> 00:45:20.678
Get over yourself, man-hands.

757
00:45:20.779 --> 00:45:22.780
You're just a passing phase.

758
00:45:22.881 --> 00:45:24.582
I'm here for the long run.

759
00:45:29.654 --> 00:45:33.324
Oh, yeah?
Are you sure about that?

760
00:45:37.247 --> 00:45:38.846
[chuckles]

761
00:45:41.483 --> 00:45:45.070
Ooh! Coffee?

762
00:45:52.962 --> 00:45:57.099
Abby, you don't need
to do this with me.

763
00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:01.536
Of course I do.
It's what best friends are for.

764
00:46:06.793 --> 00:46:09.529
There's something
I need to tell you.

765
00:46:11.882 --> 00:46:14.768
[Jo] This was it,
the moment to tell Abby

766
00:46:14.869 --> 00:46:18.705
I'd made a deal with her father
that I totally regretted,

767
00:46:18.806 --> 00:46:21.557
and beg for forgiveness.

768
00:46:21.658 --> 00:46:23.126
But looking at her,

769
00:46:23.228 --> 00:46:26.329
the idea of losing my first
best friend in a long time,

770
00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:27.814
I couldn't do it.

771
00:46:27.915 --> 00:46:31.351
So, what do you
need to tell me?

772
00:46:33.521 --> 00:46:37.656
I, um...

773
00:46:37.757 --> 00:46:42.396
You should know, my
last BFF relationship...

774
00:46:42.497 --> 00:46:44.147
crashed and burned.

775
00:46:44.248 --> 00:46:47.401
She became snobby
and judgmental

776
00:46:47.502 --> 00:46:50.821
and used guys
as pawns of warfare,

777
00:46:50.922 --> 00:46:52.973
which is saying a lot,
considering it was fourth grade.

778
00:46:53.074 --> 00:46:57.945
[laughs] Geez!
Sounds like a mini-Mandi.

779
00:46:58.046 --> 00:47:00.481
But don't worry,
we're nothing like that.

780
00:47:00.582 --> 00:47:03.168
Success! OK.

781
00:47:03.269 --> 00:47:06.888
I grabbed all the archived
papers with the Plastics,

782
00:47:06.989 --> 00:47:10.023
which was pretty much
every issue.

783
00:47:10.124 --> 00:47:13.962
- If there's dirt, we'll find it.
- What's this?

784
00:47:14.063 --> 00:47:18.801
Mandi's Annual Birthday Bash.
Everybody wants to be invited.

785
00:47:18.902 --> 00:47:20.587
But, of course, they aren't.

786
00:47:20.588 --> 00:47:23.288
Mandi never allows anybody
to throw a party when she does.

787
00:47:23.388 --> 00:47:26.275
Is that so?

788
00:47:33.182 --> 00:47:35.017
[Mandi] I am so excited.

789
00:47:35.118 --> 00:47:37.853
Tonight is gonna
be the perfect night.

790
00:47:37.954 --> 00:47:41.791
It should be.
It's costing my dad enough.

791
00:47:41.891 --> 00:47:44.059
Our dad, Tyler.

792
00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:46.629
You know, most people
would die to be my brother.

793
00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:50.366
That's only because they don't
know what you're really like.

794
00:47:50.468 --> 00:47:53.520
You mean perfect,
awesome and popular?

795
00:47:53.621 --> 00:47:58.224
More like conceited,
vain and vindictive.

796
00:47:58.325 --> 00:48:00.927
You're only happy when
making others miserable.

797
00:48:01.028 --> 00:48:02.829
But high school
will end, Mandi.

798
00:48:02.930 --> 00:48:05.231
And then what
will you have left?

799
00:48:13.958 --> 00:48:17.060
This is a bad idea.
Nobody's gonna show up.

800
00:48:17.161 --> 00:48:20.080
Of course they will. Who wants
to go to some expensive party...

801
00:48:20.181 --> 00:48:22.182
with cocktail dresses
and raw fish,

802
00:48:22.283 --> 00:48:25.319
where Mandi talks
about how awesome she is?

803
00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:27.604
People who think
Mandi's awesome.

804
00:48:27.938 --> 00:48:29.689
[sighs] No one
actually thinks that.

805
00:48:29.790 --> 00:48:32.860
Trust me, it's just years
of social brainwashing.

806
00:48:32.962 --> 00:48:35.263
- [knocks]
- Ooh!

807
00:48:35.364 --> 00:48:38.599
Wait, why aren't
you guys ready? Huh?

808
00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:43.304
- People will arrive any minute!
- We are ready.

809
00:48:43.405 --> 00:48:45.039
No! No!

810
00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:47.009
- Abby, no! Honey!
- [moans] Mom...

811
00:48:47.110 --> 00:48:49.561
I bought you all those
party clothes for a reason.

812
00:48:49.662 --> 00:48:53.314
Now you don't have an excuse,
because you're actually the host.

813
00:48:53.415 --> 00:48:55.200
Huh? Come on. Come on, come on!
Come on, let's go.

814
00:48:55.301 --> 00:48:57.552
- Come on, sugar, let's go!
- [sighs]

815
00:48:57.737 --> 00:49:02.406
Come on! My little girl
is throwing a party! [giggles]

816
00:49:05.779 --> 00:49:07.646
- Seriously?
- Mom, stop.

817
00:49:07.747 --> 00:49:11.250
Now, Jo, you know you're not gonna have
this little body forever.

818
00:49:11.351 --> 00:49:14.086
- Mom!
- I'm just saying she oughta show it off.

819
00:49:14.187 --> 00:49:17.122
- Mom, just stop!
- In something like this.

820
00:49:17.223 --> 00:49:19.893
- Ugh! Ilene Hanover!
- Definitely.

821
00:49:19.994 --> 00:49:22.862
[giggles] I knew it!

822
00:49:30.637 --> 00:49:32.972
- Invitation, miss?
- I don't have one.

823
00:49:33.073 --> 00:49:35.241
Oh, no, I'm sorry,
it's invite only.

824
00:49:39.013 --> 00:49:40.513
Okay.

825
00:49:45.703 --> 00:49:50.039
Thank you, thank you all so much
for coming to my birth...

826
00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:53.494
[crickets chirping]

827
00:49:53.595 --> 00:49:56.730
Where... Where is everyone?

828
00:49:58.916 --> 00:50:02.569
[music rumbling outside]

829
00:50:02.838 --> 00:50:05.172
[¶ IYAZ: So Big]
¶ Spend it up so big ¶

830
00:50:05.273 --> 00:50:08.076
¶ So the whole world

01:00:05.545 --> 01:00:08.078
Just needed to dig
a little deeper.

1006
01:00:10.549 --> 01:00:12.201
[Jo] Hi!

1007
01:00:12.302 --> 01:00:14.236
Hey.

1008
01:00:14.337 --> 01:00:17.572
- Hey!
- Hey!

1009
01:00:17.673 --> 01:00:19.441
- Hi.
- [all] Hey!

1010
01:00:19.542 --> 01:00:22.494
- Hello, girls.
- [all] Hey!

1011
01:00:22.595 --> 01:00:24.796
- [girl] I already got my dress.
- Hey.

1012
01:00:24.897 --> 01:00:25.983
Oh, hey, Abby.

1013
01:00:25.984 --> 01:00:28.383
Okay, Jo, this year the music
better not suck at the dance.

1014
01:00:28.384 --> 01:00:30.185
- You've sway with the DJ, right?
- Of course.

1015
01:00:30.186 --> 01:00:32.354
- What are your requests?
- Okay...

1016
01:00:32.455 --> 01:00:35.257
- We could get that guy who...
- You know, if she keeps...

1017
01:00:35.359 --> 01:00:38.394
inviting everybody
to join our group,

1018
01:00:38.495 --> 01:00:40.295
there won't be any room left.

1019
01:00:40.396 --> 01:00:43.999
At least Mandi understood
the importance of exclusivity.

1020
01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:47.037
Someone has to be
the proletariat.

1021
01:00:47.138 --> 01:00:49.472
That's lower class.

1022
01:00:50.073 --> 01:00:51.674
[grunts]

1023
01:00:56.396 --> 01:00:58.564
Hey, kid.
Lend me a hand, huh?

1024
01:00:58.665 --> 01:01:01.218
Jimmy gave me an extension
on delivering the engine.

1025
01:01:01.319 --> 01:01:02.869
Um, sorry, Dad.

1026
01:01:02.970 --> 01:01:05.404
I've got shopping with Quinn
and a movie with Tyler,

1027
01:01:05.505 --> 01:01:08.475
and I still have
to make my campaign buttons.

1028
01:01:08.576 --> 01:01:10.677
Busy, busy!

1029
01:01:14.465 --> 01:01:16.533
Busy, busy.

1030
01:01:18.253 --> 01:01:19.653
- [boy] Hey, Jo.
- Hi.

1031
01:01:19.754 --> 01:01:21.238
- Hey!
- Hi.

1032
01:01:21.339 --> 01:01:22.923
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.

1033
01:01:23.274 --> 01:01:25.992
- What's up?
- Hi.

1034
01:01:28.195 --> 01:01:29.763
I wonder how much
sugar is in this.

1035
01:01:29.864 --> 01:01:32.934
- You did not just ask that.
- What?

1036
01:01:33.035 --> 01:01:36.071
Jo, you ate, like,
two funnel cakes, a hot dog...

1037
01:01:36.172 --> 01:01:38.522
and a bag of kettle corn
on our first date.

1038
01:01:38.623 --> 01:01:42.610
And you didn't wear
these crazy studded boots.

1039
01:01:49.135 --> 01:01:51.269
Come on.
You're kidding me, right?

1040
01:01:51.370 --> 01:01:54.105
- Using me to make Chastity jealous?
- Look, I was just...

1041
01:01:54.206 --> 01:01:56.825
Starting to act a hell
of a lot like Mandi,

1042
01:01:56.926 --> 01:01:59.277
which is not the kind of
girl I want to be dating.

1043
01:01:59.378 --> 01:02:02.480
Hey, I am nothing like Mandi.

1044
01:02:02.581 --> 01:02:07.052
Oh, really? Running
for queen, humiliating people,

1045
01:02:07.153 --> 01:02:10.455
using their secrets against them, dressing
like you're on the cover of Rolling Stone,

1046
01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:13.659
which, OK, it's kinda hot sometimes,
but not the part...

1047
01:02:13.761 --> 01:02:17.145
where you suddenly care about
what everyone else thinks.

1048
01:02:18.682 --> 01:02:20.934
Jo...

1049
01:02:21.035 --> 01:02:24.270
What happened to that girl
I met in shop class?

1050
01:02:27.757 --> 01:02:29.209
[scoffs]

1051
01:02:43.992 --> 01:02:46.526
[Jo] And when I got home,
there it was,

1052
01:02:46.628 --> 01:02:49.496
waiting for me:
my future.

1053
01:02:49.597 --> 01:02:52.133
How had I almost forgotten?

1054
01:02:59.073 --> 01:03:01.309
The fat letter!

1055
01:03:01.410 --> 01:03:04.862
- It's good news, right?
- The best.

1056
01:03:06.298 --> 01:03:08.682
Ah, Jo. Look, honey,

1057
01:03:08.783 --> 01:03:12.403
I feel lousy
about your tuition fund.

1058
01:03:12.504 --> 01:03:14.672
But, honey, that doesn't mean
that you shouldn't be excited.

1059
01:03:14.773 --> 01:03:17.826
I mean, CMU, that's...
that's big stuff!

1060
01:03:17.926 --> 01:03:19.860
And if I can just get
this engine finished,

1061
01:03:19.961 --> 01:03:23.114
or... what about that
architectural scholarship?

1062
01:03:23.215 --> 01:03:24.667
The scholarship.

1063
01:03:24.768 --> 01:03:26.535
[Jo] But somehow,
all this campaigning...

1064
01:03:26.636 --> 01:03:30.137
and preening and plotting
had gotten in the way.

1065
01:03:30.238 --> 01:03:33.909
I didn't even know what my grade was
in shop class anymore.

1066
01:03:35.611 --> 01:03:38.330
Oh, hey, I almost forgot. Um...

1067
01:03:38.431 --> 01:03:41.784
Abby's dad dropped
this off for ya.

1068
01:03:41.885 --> 01:03:43.635
So does she know where
she's goin' to college yet?

1069
01:03:43.736 --> 01:03:47.956
Um, Abby wants art school, but
her dad's more of a pre-med guy.

1070
01:03:48.057 --> 01:03:52.194
Well, just make sure that she knows
that to, um, to win the race...

1071
01:03:52.295 --> 01:03:54.613
You gotta be in the race.

1072
01:04:06.377 --> 01:04:08.778
[Jo] But what if I wanted out?

1073
01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:10.413
What if I wanted
to forfeit the race...

1074
01:04:10.514 --> 01:04:14.118
because I didn't
deserve to win?

1075
01:04:14.219 --> 01:04:16.969
Got something
that's real revolutionary.

1076
01:04:17.070 --> 01:04:20.941
It's gonna revolutionize
your gardening experience.

1077
01:04:21.709 --> 01:04:24.211
[Jo] Hey, Mr. Hanover.

1078
01:04:24.312 --> 01:04:25.845
Abby's not home
from the movie yet, is she?

1079
01:04:26.113 --> 01:04:28.816
[Mr. Hanover] No,
thought you'd be with 'em.

1080
01:04:28.917 --> 01:04:34.622
- But glad you're here.
- Listen, Mr. Hanover, I...

1081
01:04:34.723 --> 01:04:39.126
- I brought back the money.
- Jo, what, are you crazy?

1082
01:04:39.227 --> 01:04:42.279
The money's for you,
every damn penny. You've earned it.

1083
01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:46.468
Hiring you to be her friend was
the best money we've ever spent.

1084
01:04:46.569 --> 01:04:50.354
Please, Mr. Hanover,
I can't.

1085
01:04:51.857 --> 01:04:53.758
Jo, I'm sending it
right back to you.

1086
01:04:53.859 --> 01:04:56.011
I'd give a bonus,
if I gave them.

1087
01:04:56.112 --> 01:04:57.629
Which I don't.

1088
01:05:10.759 --> 01:05:14.696
Is it true? Did my dad pay
you to be friends with me?

1089
01:05:15.882 --> 01:05:18.134
Quinn finally
got her big story.

1090
01:05:18.235 --> 01:05:20.602
She quoted Mandi
as a witness.

1091
01:05:20.703 --> 01:05:22.287
Why would Quinn do this?

1092
01:05:22.388 --> 01:05:25.391
How could you?

1093
01:05:25.492 --> 01:05:28.828
- I was gonna tell Abby everything.
- Face it, Jo.

1094
01:05:28.929 --> 01:05:30.712
The Plastics
are the originals,

1095
01:05:30.813 --> 01:05:33.265
and they don't have to pay
anyone to be their friend.

1096
01:05:33.366 --> 01:05:35.935
No! You just sold out
your friends for free!

1097
01:05:36.036 --> 01:05:37.937
Oh, what,
like you sold me out?

1098
01:05:38.038 --> 01:05:40.339
[sobbing] God, I trusted you.

1099
01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:43.376
You know what?
You go to hell, Jo Mitchell.

1100
01:05:43.478 --> 01:05:45.044
I wish I never even met you.

1101
01:06:28.373 --> 01:06:30.324
[Chastity] Just
to see their faces.

1102
01:06:30.425 --> 01:06:33.761
You were so good, Mandi.
I totally voted for you.

1103
01:06:33.862 --> 01:06:36.381
- It's too bad this didn't come out earlier.
- Why?

1104
01:06:36.481 --> 01:06:39.919
Well, from what I hear, Jo is
a shoo-in for Homecoming Queen.

1105
01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:42.220
It's too late for people
to change their votes.

1106
01:06:42.321 --> 01:06:47.726
- That is, if she's eligible.
- Eligibility is based on matriculation.

1107
01:06:47.827 --> 01:06:53.048
- So she'd have to be expelled or something.
- Oh.

1108
01:06:54.718 --> 01:06:56.886
Wouldn't that be a tragedy?

1109
01:07:13.170 --> 01:07:16.204
[Nick] This is gonna be
the best senior prank ever.

1110
01:07:16.305 --> 01:07:17.756
The best.

1111
01:07:19.927 --> 01:07:23.263
OK, so tell me again
why we don't keep the money?

1112
01:07:23.363 --> 01:07:26.165
- That's a lot of money.
- Then there's no dance,

1113
01:07:26.266 --> 01:07:29.136
and if there's no dance,
I'm not the queen.

1114
01:07:29.921 --> 01:07:32.655
I don't know.

1115
01:07:32.756 --> 01:07:35.309
[sighs] Money can't do this.

1116
01:07:42.634 --> 01:07:45.903
[engine revving]

1117
01:07:46.271 --> 01:07:48.855
As many of you know,
we had a robbery last night.

1118
01:07:48.956 --> 01:07:53.343
Now, the evidence strongly
suggests that the thief

1119
01:07:53.445 --> 01:07:57.665
was a student, because of his
wanton disregard for school property.

1120
01:07:57.766 --> 01:08:01.568
This student, or students,
clearly degenerates,

1121
01:08:01.669 --> 01:08:05.840
stole the money that was
intended for helpless animals.

1122
01:08:05.941 --> 01:08:07.625
Now, unless
the money is returned,

1123
01:08:07.726 --> 01:08:12.529
I have no choice but
to cancel the Homecoming Dance.

1124
01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:16.585
- [all muttering]
- This is your principal,

1125
01:08:16.686 --> 01:08:18.003
signing off for today,

1126
01:08:18.104 --> 01:08:22.340
reminding you to stay left
or right, not center.

1127
01:08:27.180 --> 01:08:32.484
Miss Mitchell, I received an anonymous
tip today that you stole the money.

1128
01:08:32.585 --> 01:08:36.021
That's a lie.
I would never do that.

1129
01:08:36.322 --> 01:08:37.605
Well, apparently you did.

1130
01:08:37.706 --> 01:08:40.843
We had a policeman go
to your shed this afternoon.

1131
01:08:42.513 --> 01:08:44.913
And I'm afraid we
found the stolen money.

1132
01:08:45.215 --> 01:08:47.951
- How did that get there?
- I didn't steal it, I swear!

1133
01:08:48.052 --> 01:08:50.303
Somebody must've
put it there, and...

1134
01:08:50.404 --> 01:08:52.321
I would bet anything
it was Mandi.

1135
01:08:52.623 --> 01:08:55.759
Well, now, Miss Weatherly
may be the spawn of Satan,

1136
01:08:55.860 --> 01:08:57.327
but unless you have proof,

1137
01:08:57.428 --> 01:08:59.462
there's nothing I can do
except expel you.

1138
01:08:59.563 --> 01:09:02.816
[Jo] It officially
couldn't get much worse.

1139
01:09:02.917 --> 01:09:06.653
I'm also sorry to say that I'm gonna
have to report this to Carnegie Mellon,

1140
01:09:06.754 --> 01:09:10.574
and they very well may
rescind your admission.

1141
01:09:11.576 --> 01:09:14.327
Miss Mitchell, where are
you going? Come back here!

1142
01:09:14.428 --> 01:09:16.130
- Did you hear about Jo?
- I can't believe it.

1143
01:09:16.231 --> 01:09:17.898
- What a fake.
- I knew it.

1144
01:09:17.999 --> 01:09:21.418
I knew it all along,
and I tried to warn people.

1145
01:09:21.485 --> 01:09:24.154
I tried to protect
you all from her.

1146
01:09:24.255 --> 01:09:27.124
- Mandi, you are like a saint.
- Yeah, a total saint.

1147
01:09:27.225 --> 01:09:30.794
- Oh, yeah, a real martyr.
- You mean a real bitch!

1148
01:09:30.895 --> 01:09:34.865
Wait. As much as we all might like that,
I can't let it happen.

1149
01:09:34.966 --> 01:09:38.169
This is crazy! Shouldn't she be
locked up in juvie or something?

1150
01:09:38.471 --> 01:09:40.288
Girls, why don't we
settle this like ladies...

1151
01:09:40.389 --> 01:09:42.056
Screw being ladies,
and screw being girls!

1152
01:09:42.157 --> 01:09:45.843
I'm sick of the mind games
and the backstabbing and the set-ups.

1153
01:09:45.944 --> 01:09:50.247
I know you framed me, Mandi.

1154
01:09:50.349 --> 01:09:53.701
So we're gonna settle this
like men, on the battlefield.

1155
01:09:53.802 --> 01:09:56.004
- Oh, please.
- That's right.

1156
01:09:56.105 --> 01:09:57.488
I challenge you...

1157
01:10:02.579 --> 01:10:04.679
...to a football game,

1158
01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:07.683
- Powder Puff style.
- No way.

1159
01:10:07.784 --> 01:10:10.185
I... I don't do sports.

1160
01:10:10.286 --> 01:10:12.705
Aw, you scared?

1161
01:10:12.806 --> 01:10:16.008
Can't take the heat, Mandi?

1162
01:10:16.109 --> 01:10:18.544
I thought you were
the best at everything.

1163
01:10:18.645 --> 01:10:23.417
I thought people trembled in
the presence of the Plastics.

1164
01:10:23.518 --> 01:10:25.201
You wanna win?

1165
01:10:25.386 --> 01:10:30.740
The only way you're gonna
become queen is by default.

1166
01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:38.047
Fine, you're on.

1167
01:10:38.147 --> 01:10:40.416
But be prepared to lose.

1168
01:10:40.517 --> 01:10:43.620
You know, you
and your team of one.

1169
01:10:51.379 --> 01:10:55.850
[Jo] I realized a little too late
that I no longer had any friends.

1170
01:10:55.951 --> 01:11:01.137
But if I had to take on
all the Plastics by myself, I would.

1171
01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:12.016
All right, let's get to class, everybody.
Hang out in the hallway.

1172
01:11:12.117 --> 01:11:15.419
- Do you really think she did it?
- I don't know anymore.

1173
01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:17.455
Certainly not about Jo.

1174
01:11:28.952 --> 01:11:33.822
Hey, Mr. Hanover, this was in our mailbox.
It's for you.

1175
01:11:33.922 --> 01:11:37.359
- Listen, you're Jo's boyfriend, right?
- Ex-boyfriend.

1176
01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:40.845
Huh, awkward.

1177
01:11:40.946 --> 01:11:43.265
Thing is, I've got something for Jo.
It's the money, actually.

1178
01:11:43.366 --> 01:11:47.102
Would you give it to her? A deal's a deal.
It's not her fault Abby found out.

1179
01:11:49.205 --> 01:11:52.775
- She gave the money back to you?
- Of course.

1180
01:11:52.876 --> 01:11:54.644
I was expecting it, really.

1181
01:11:54.745 --> 01:11:56.912
I knew she'd love Abby
once she got to know her.

1182
01:11:57.012 --> 01:11:58.346
I just needed
to make that happen.

1183
01:11:58.514 --> 01:12:00.617
So remember, you can't wear
red or pink to the dance.

1184
01:12:00.718 --> 01:12:02.418
Those are my colors.
And I'm wearing my hair up,

1185
01:12:02.519 --> 01:12:05.255
'cause it's best for the crown,
so wear yours down.

1186
01:12:05.356 --> 01:12:09.659
- Quinn, are you listening?
- Yes, absolutely. Hair down.

1187
01:12:13.881 --> 01:12:16.567
Hey, Abby.

1188
01:12:18.870 --> 01:12:21.303
- Look, just don't.
- But...

1189
01:12:21.404 --> 01:12:23.891
You know, Jo may
have lied to me,

1190
01:12:23.992 --> 01:12:25.693
but at least she
taught me one thing.

1191
01:12:25.794 --> 01:12:30.164
Stand up for myself.
So... get lost, Quinn.

1192
01:12:30.263 --> 01:12:33.150
Fine, hate me.

1193
01:12:33.251 --> 01:12:37.187
But you should know I don't
think Jo stole the money.

1194
01:12:37.288 --> 01:12:39.657
I think Mandi did.

1195
01:12:39.758 --> 01:12:43.260
- How do you know?
- Because I sort of gave her...

1196
01:12:43.361 --> 01:12:46.163
the idea to get Jo expelled.

1197
01:12:47.983 --> 01:12:52.370
Also, Jo spent an awful lot
of time putting together...

1198
01:12:52.471 --> 01:12:56.307
and sending out college
applications for you.

1199
01:12:56.408 --> 01:12:59.577
She even put together
your portfolio.

1200
01:13:02.498 --> 01:13:07.068
I helped her make about a dozen of those
with journalism equipment.

1201
01:13:08.671 --> 01:13:12.124
I hope you get
into art school, Abby.

1202
01:13:12.225 --> 01:13:13.993
I really do.

1203
01:13:29.075 --> 01:13:31.010
[grunts]

1204
01:13:32.479 --> 01:13:35.247
So Mr. Hanover just called.

1205
01:13:35.348 --> 01:13:38.935
Apparently, one of his distributors
is sending new parts for the engine.

1206
01:13:40.470 --> 01:13:42.438
That's great, right?

1207
01:13:42.539 --> 01:13:46.677
We can finish the car in time
for Jimmy and the new racer.

1208
01:13:46.778 --> 01:13:49.878
So, you, uh...
You heard from Abby?

1209
01:13:51.614 --> 01:13:53.917
I've texted, called.

1210
01:13:54.018 --> 01:13:57.354
I tried her
NorthShoreCentric page.

1211
01:13:57.455 --> 01:14:02.960
No luck. That girl
really hates my guts.

1212
01:14:03.061 --> 01:14:07.097
But I can't blame her.
I'm not sure why you don't hate me.

1213
01:14:07.198 --> 01:14:12.536
Listen, kid, I'm not proud
of what you did to Abby,

1214
01:14:12.637 --> 01:14:15.505
but I know
that you care about her.

1215
01:14:15.606 --> 01:14:20.260
- And you're certainly not a thief.
- At least someone believes me.

1216
01:14:20.361 --> 01:14:23.630
[doors closing]

1217
01:14:23.731 --> 01:14:26.300
Oh, I don't
think it's just me.

1218
01:14:33.643 --> 01:14:36.860
- Am I seeing things?
- We haven't forgiven you yet.

1219
01:14:36.961 --> 01:14:38.563
Not even close.

1220
01:14:41.801 --> 01:14:44.285
But we can't let you
take the fall for Mandi.

1221
01:14:44.386 --> 01:14:47.622
- That's right, we've got your back.
- Mandi's goin' down.

1222
01:14:47.723 --> 01:14:49.742
- [all chuckling]
- I knew it.

1223
01:14:49.843 --> 01:14:52.393
I knew Mandi set me up, and...

1224
01:14:53.262 --> 01:14:55.548
you guys came to rescue me.

1225
01:14:57.233 --> 01:14:59.218
I don't deserve you.

1226
01:15:00.253 --> 01:15:02.087
Oh, my God, are you crying?

1227
01:15:02.188 --> 01:15:06.259
- No, I never cry.
- [laughs]

1228
01:15:08.678 --> 01:15:11.013
All right, now come on,
we have a game to prepare for.

1229
01:15:11.114 --> 01:15:13.983
And you're right,
Mandi needs her ass kicked.

1230
01:15:14.084 --> 01:15:16.286
And we have an idea
to prove your innocence.

1231
01:15:38.727 --> 01:15:42.061
- Do you think you can do it?
- Hack into their security system?

1232
01:15:42.162 --> 01:15:45.766
Not easy, but not impossible.
I just have to detect their wireless signal,

1233
01:15:45.867 --> 01:15:48.536
then hack into their computer
and find their security account.

1234
01:15:48.637 --> 01:15:50.771
- Uh, wait, got it.
- [beeping]

1235
01:15:51.005 --> 01:15:53.557
They named their Wi-Fi
"AlwaysWatching?"

1236
01:15:53.658 --> 01:15:55.759
What's their
pass code, "666?"

1237
01:15:55.860 --> 01:15:59.397
It'll take a few days, but if
Mandi planted the evidence,

1238
01:15:59.498 --> 01:16:01.133
I'll find the footage.

1239
01:16:01.234 --> 01:16:05.403
But... I want
something in return.

1240
01:16:05.504 --> 01:16:07.371
I knew it. I knew
he wouldn't do it for free.

1241
01:16:07.539 --> 01:16:09.741
What do you
want, Elliot?

1242
01:16:09.842 --> 01:16:13.745
A date to the dance,
with Abby.

1243
01:16:17.834 --> 01:16:21.353
Oh, um, hey, good luck at the game.
I'll be rooting for you.

1244
01:16:21.453 --> 01:16:23.788
Uh, even got my
own side biz going on.

1245
01:16:23.890 --> 01:16:26.525
Odds are 30 to one
in Mandi's favor.

1246
01:16:26.626 --> 01:16:29.961
- What? Why?
- You haven't heard?

1247
01:16:30.062 --> 01:16:34.667
[Jo] Mandi had managed to recruit
the captain of the rugby team...

1248
01:16:36.069 --> 01:16:38.837
a fifth-year senior
who felt no pain...

1249
01:16:40.373 --> 01:16:45.043
and the three-time Junior Division
Karate Champion onto her team.

1250
01:16:46.145 --> 01:16:48.747
But we weren't backing down.

1251
01:16:49.766 --> 01:16:51.083
And neither was Mandi.

1252
01:16:51.184 --> 01:16:53.786
She wasn't going
to pull any punches.

1253
01:16:53.971 --> 01:16:57.140
It was time to end this
once and for all.

1254
01:17:04.398 --> 01:17:06.266
- Got it?
- Yes, sir!

1255
01:17:06.367 --> 01:17:08.268
Good!

1256
01:17:08.369 --> 01:17:11.404
Hi, baby!
Oh, you look so cute.

1257
01:17:11.505 --> 01:17:12.774
Our little athlete.

1258
01:17:12.775 --> 01:17:15.574
Mom, Dad, come on.
You know you can't be in here. Just go.

1259
01:17:15.575 --> 01:17:17.994
You're right, you're right.
We need to find a seat.

1260
01:17:18.095 --> 01:17:21.632
- The bleachers are already filling up.
- Yay! Yay!

1261
01:17:24.969 --> 01:17:28.789
- I'm gonna vomit.
- It's gonna be OK, I promise.

1262
01:17:28.890 --> 01:17:31.792
- What's the worst that could happen?
- [all] We lose?

1263
01:17:31.893 --> 01:17:35.178
- [knocking on door]
- Is everybody decent in here?

1264
01:17:35.279 --> 01:17:38.165
I don't want a sexual
harassment lawsuit... again.

1265
01:17:38.417 --> 01:17:39.684
- [all] Yeah.
- Yeah, we're good.

1266
01:17:39.785 --> 01:17:41.986
Principal Duvall, what are you
doing here on a weekend?

1267
01:17:42.087 --> 01:17:45.189
Well, I've tried to turn
a blind eye to this game,

1268
01:17:45.290 --> 01:17:48.042
but the fact that you made
the challenge in my presence,

1269
01:17:48.143 --> 01:17:52.680
and you've plastered the school
with posters made that kinda hard.

1270
01:17:52.781 --> 01:17:54.733
Thought you guys would wimp out.

1271
01:17:54.834 --> 01:17:57.886
But I guess now
I will have to intervene.

1272
01:17:57.987 --> 01:18:01.455
Mainly because Mandi's team
wants to file a lawsuit.

1273
01:18:01.556 --> 01:18:04.676
- What are you talking about?
- Jo, due to your expulsion,

1274
01:18:04.777 --> 01:18:07.029
you are not allowed
on school grounds.

1275
01:18:07.130 --> 01:18:08.930
Thus, you cannot play the game.

1276
01:18:09.031 --> 01:18:13.452
- Damn it! Mandi was counting on this.
- I know.

1277
01:18:13.653 --> 01:18:14.555
You know?

1278
01:18:14.556 --> 01:18:17.355
Yep, which is why I looked
into this issue days ago.

1279
01:18:17.356 --> 01:18:18.925
You know, technically,

1280
01:18:19.026 --> 01:18:21.826
the football field is public property
since it's on park land.

1281
01:18:21.928 --> 01:18:24.530
You know, the school
only rents it for games.

1282
01:18:24.630 --> 01:18:28.734
So all we needed was a permit,
which I have right here.

1283
01:18:28.835 --> 01:18:31.620
Oh! Well, great then.

1284
01:18:31.721 --> 01:18:35.591
I guess you are just not
allowed in the locker room.

1285
01:18:35.692 --> 01:18:39.846
Oh. See ya!

1286
01:18:39.947 --> 01:18:42.399
Well, I guess my
job here is done.

1287
01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:44.651
Ha-ha! Let's go, team!

1288
01:18:44.752 --> 01:18:47.453
Kill! Maim! Dismember.

1289
01:18:47.688 --> 01:18:52.259
- [cheering]
- [booing]

1290
01:18:55.312 --> 01:18:57.214
Whoo! Yeah!

1291
01:18:59.468 --> 01:19:02.503
- [booing]
- Yeah! Whoo!

1292
01:19:02.604 --> 01:19:04.988
- [cheering]
- Go, Abby!

1293
01:19:05.089 --> 01:19:06.773
[booing]

1294
01:19:06.874 --> 01:19:08.392
[Jo] The big day was upon us,

1295
01:19:08.493 --> 01:19:11.628
and we were going
to take the Plastics down.

1296
01:19:14.249 --> 01:19:15.651
Come on, girls!

1297
01:19:15.752 --> 01:19:19.403
[Jo] We were ready
for anything.

1298
01:19:25.594 --> 01:19:27.628
Didn't expect to see me here?

1299
01:19:27.729 --> 01:19:30.281
I'm still gonna
kick your team's ass.

1300
01:19:30.382 --> 01:19:31.683
OK, girls, listen up.

1301
01:19:31.918 --> 01:19:35.670
Football is a religion,
and you are now in church.

1302
01:19:35.771 --> 01:19:38.957
Do not disgrace this field.
We'll play by playground rules.

1303
01:19:39.058 --> 01:19:43.327
Fumbles that hit the ground
are live balls. Four downs and out.

1304
01:19:43.429 --> 01:19:47.433
No punts, no extra points
and a touchdown is seven points.

1305
01:19:47.534 --> 01:19:52.237
Get it? Got it? Good!

1306
01:19:52.338 --> 01:19:54.840
We will flip a coin to see
who receives the ball.

1307
01:19:54.942 --> 01:19:57.143
- Pink Team, you call it.
- Heads.

1308
01:19:58.696 --> 01:20:01.546
- Heads it is.
- We'll receive.

1309
01:20:01.648 --> 01:20:04.284
All right, shake hands.

1310
01:20:06.253 --> 01:20:08.388
- [cheering]
- OK, then.

1311
01:20:09.039 --> 01:20:10.891
Ow!

1312
01:20:14.261 --> 01:20:16.496
[whistle blows]

1313
01:20:19.533 --> 01:20:20.900
[cheering]

1314
01:20:22.570 --> 01:20:24.820
Run, moron, run!

1315
01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:33.430
- Take it, take it.
- [whistle blows]

1316
01:20:34.733 --> 01:20:37.518
[cheering]

1317
01:20:39.570 --> 01:20:41.938
[grunting]

1318
01:20:44.076 --> 01:20:45.977
[screaming]

1319
01:20:49.447 --> 01:20:50.464
[blowing whistle]

1320
01:20:50.648 --> 01:20:53.952
- There's no nunchakus in football!
- Man.

1321
01:20:59.125 --> 01:21:00.675
Ball, now!

1322
01:21:02.828 --> 01:21:04.446
[crowd cheering]

1323
01:21:04.547 --> 01:21:06.497
[screaming]

1324
01:21:10.670 --> 01:21:12.570
[whistle blowing]

1325
01:21:15.825 --> 01:21:17.275
Touchdown!

1326
01:21:17.376 --> 01:21:19.494
Yay!

1327
01:21:20.029 --> 01:21:21.345
[barks]

1328
01:21:24.818 --> 01:21:26.836
[cheering]

1329
01:21:35.878 --> 01:21:39.282
- [cheering]
- [blowing whistle]

1330
01:21:39.634 --> 01:21:41.050
[grunting]

1331
01:21:55.566 --> 01:21:58.251

01:31:21.351 --> 01:31:23.385
- So how does it look?
- Nice crown.

1496
01:31:23.486 --> 01:31:25.388
Thanks. I thought it
went with the t-shirt.

1497
01:31:25.489 --> 01:31:27.691
[both chuckle]

1498
01:31:27.792 --> 01:31:30.659
[Jo] So I guess my dad
was right after all.

1499
01:31:30.760 --> 01:31:33.495
To win the race,
you have to be in the race.

1500
01:31:33.596 --> 01:31:38.335
Sometimes it just takes a little girl drama
to find out who your friends are.

1501
01:31:38.436 --> 01:31:42.972
And, once you have that, you
can survive almost anything...

1502
01:31:43.073 --> 01:31:46.409
- even high school.

1503
01:31:46.510 --> 01:31:49.913
¶ I know, I know ¶

1504
01:31:50.014 --> 01:31:52.515
¶ Every day you're
getting closer ¶

1505
01:31:52.616 --> 01:31:54.284
¶ The time is ticking slow ¶

1506
01:31:54.385 --> 01:31:56.753
¶ And I know, I know ¶

1507
01:31:56.855 --> 01:31:59.089
¶ I know ¶

1508
01:31:59.191 --> 01:32:01.759
¶ There's no room
to be impatient ¶

1509
01:32:01.861 --> 01:32:05.896
¶ I don't mind waiting ¶

1510
01:32:05.997 --> 01:32:10.668
¶ What's your name?
One day you're gonna know mine ¶

1511
01:32:10.769 --> 01:32:16.174
¶ Going on this way... ¶

1512
01:32:16.275 --> 01:32:18.476
¶ My mama would say ¶

1513
01:32:18.577 --> 01:32:21.913
¶ You're gonna find
the right one ¶

1514
01:32:22.014 --> 01:32:25.449
¶ At the right time ¶

1515
01:32:25.550 --> 01:32:27.952
¶ It ain't right for me
to know ¶

1516
01:32:28.053 --> 01:32:31.289
¶ Who you are
I should have met you first ¶

1517
01:32:31.390 --> 01:32:34.526
¶ But that's not
how it works ¶

1518
01:32:34.627 --> 01:32:37.095
¶ So I'm giving all control ¶

1519
01:32:37.196 --> 01:32:40.299
¶ Hoping, praying
Wishing, waiting ¶

1520
01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:42.234
¶ For you ¶

1521
01:32:42.335 --> 01:32:44.703
¶ Yes, I know, I know ¶

1522
01:32:44.804 --> 01:32:47.039
¶ I know ¶

1523
01:32:47.140 --> 01:32:49.641

¶ There's no room
to be impatient ¶

¶ I don't mind waiting ¶

1537
01:33:20.208 --> 01:33:22.875
¶ Wait forever on the line ¶

1538
01:33:22.977 --> 01:33:25.145
¶ I'm looking for a sign ¶

1539
01:33:25.246 --> 01:33:27.982
¶ A little bit of winds
below these clouds ¶

1540
01:33:28.083 --> 01:33:31.118
¶ There is a light ¶

1541
01:33:31.219 --> 01:33:36.958
¶ To let me know
that it was all worthwhile ¶

1542
01:33:37.059 --> 01:33:39.460
¶ 'Cause I know, I know ¶

1543
01:33:39.561 --> 01:33:41.829
