00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:32.081
There are times in your life
when you find yourself...

2
00:00:32.183 --> 00:00:35.517
in very awkward situations.

3
00:00:35.618 --> 00:00:38.119
I mean, just look
at that face, Jo.

4
00:00:38.221 --> 00:00:40.021
Abby needs you.

5
00:00:40.122 --> 00:00:41.623
We need you.

6
00:00:41.724 --> 00:00:44.026
And we're willing to pay.

7
00:00:44.127 --> 00:00:46.829
And this would
be one of those moments.

8
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.049
But I swear, it's not like I'm
selling my kidney or anything.

9
00:00:51.201 --> 00:00:54.037
Although, that would
have been less painful.

10
00:00:54.138 --> 00:00:56.138
But I'm getting
ahead of myself.

11
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.307
Let me start at the beginning.

12
00:00:58.408 --> 00:01:01.445
And it's the big day, the
qualifying race of the Indy 500.

13
00:01:01.546 --> 00:01:03.478
- She takes her position...
- This is my dad.

14
00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:05.781
...revs the motor
of her stock car, hoping...

15
00:01:05.949 --> 00:01:09.235
To not crash and burn on
the last lap of adolescence.

16
00:01:09.336 --> 00:01:13.774
- Oh, that's my girl.
- Dad built engines for race cars.

17
00:01:13.824 --> 00:01:16.027
And so did I.

18
00:01:16.262 --> 00:01:19.612
Ignore the pigtails.
I was more naive back then.

19
00:01:19.713 --> 00:01:22.516
Because of his work,
I changed schools...

20
00:01:22.617 --> 00:01:27.023
two times a year
for the past eight years.

21
00:01:27.524 --> 00:01:29.050
This doesn't make me
a loner

22
00:01:29.063 --> 00:01:32.143
with a highly evolved
defense mechanism or anything.

23
00:01:32.443 --> 00:01:34.845
OK, fine, it does.

24
00:01:34.946 --> 00:01:38.634
Today, everything
was about to change.

25
00:01:38.735 --> 00:01:41.203
It was my first day
at North Shore High,

26
00:01:41.304 --> 00:01:44.639
the last stop before
Carnegie Mellon University,

27
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.407
my dream school.

28
00:01:46.508 --> 00:01:49.078
My rules of survival
were simple:

29
00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.881
Don't stand out,
never raise your hand in class...

30
00:01:52.982 --> 00:01:55.851
and watch your back
at all times.

31
00:01:57.254 --> 00:02:00.806
New town, same school,
same parking lot.

32
00:02:00.907 --> 00:02:04.075
Everyone obsessed with the
freedom of their first car.

33
00:02:04.176 --> 00:02:08.581
It's an identity, like the muscle
cars who think they own the road,

34
00:02:08.682 --> 00:02:11.218
and check out
every passing vehicle.

35
00:02:13.804 --> 00:02:16.073
Smart cars who don't fit in.

36
00:02:16.174 --> 00:02:19.376
- Whoa!
- The "I'm so perky...

37
00:02:19.377 --> 00:02:21.964
I might shake off my tube top"
cutesy cars.

38
00:02:23.065 --> 00:02:26.165
And then there's the most
dangerous vehicle on the road,

39
00:02:26.266 --> 00:02:29.837
the high-performance,
high-maintenance sports cars.

40
00:02:34.444 --> 00:02:37.830
If they liked you,
your life was all green lights.

41
00:02:37.931 --> 00:02:39.496
- Hi.
- Hi.

42
00:02:39.598 --> 00:02:40.965
If they didn't,

43
00:02:41.066 --> 00:02:43.902
you were nothing more than a
wreck on the side of the road.

44
00:02:53.394 --> 00:02:55.997
At North Shore,
they were called the Plastics,

45
00:02:56.098 --> 00:02:59.902
and Mandi Weatherly
was the number one Plastic.

46
00:03:00.002 --> 00:03:03.640
She dotted her name with a
signature heart above the "i".

47
00:03:03.741 --> 00:03:07.609
Probably because she didn't
actually possess that organ.

48
00:03:07.711 --> 00:03:10.012
Her two sidekicks
were Chastity Meyer,

49
00:03:10.113 --> 00:03:14.751
who was stupid enough to hit a home
run with any boy willing to play,

50
00:03:14.852 --> 00:03:17.621
and Hope Plotkin,
uber-hypochondriac,

51
00:03:17.724 --> 00:03:19.825
who believed that germs
led to ugliness,

52
00:03:19.925 --> 00:03:21.859
and ugliness led to death.

53
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.196
And thus, my number one rule
for survival: no girl drama.

54
00:03:26.297 --> 00:03:30.435
Actually, no drama, period.

55
00:03:30.536 --> 00:03:32.822
Please, please,
don't be ruined!

56
00:03:32.923 --> 00:03:35.501
And in high school, an already
embarrassing moment

57
00:03:35.511 --> 00:03:36.358
can go from bad...

58
00:03:36.458 --> 00:03:37.607
- Whoa!
- Oh!

59
00:03:37.708 --> 00:03:39.661
to worse.

60
00:03:39.762 --> 00:03:42.497
- Are you OK?
- How bad do I look?

61
00:03:42.698 --> 00:03:44.033
She couldn't
have looked worse.

62
00:03:44.134 --> 00:03:47.452
- You look great.
- Really? Thanks.

63
00:03:47.785 --> 00:03:49.720
I'm Abby Hanover.
Yeah, you must be new.

64
00:03:49.821 --> 00:03:51.400
I'm part of the welcoming
committee.

65
00:03:51.415 --> 00:03:52.592
Well, there's only
two of us, really, and...

66
00:03:52.692 --> 00:03:56.179
and I'd... I'd love
to show you around.

67
00:03:57.313 --> 00:04:00.183
- Are they gone?
- Yeah.

68
00:04:00.284 --> 00:04:05.721
Listen, I think I can find my way
to the front office, thanks.

69
00:04:05.822 --> 00:04:09.475
So, Jo, I see your
dad's big in NASCAR.

70
00:04:09.576 --> 00:04:11.344
Well, let me set
your mind at ease.

71
00:04:11.445 --> 00:04:15.447
We know how to deal with
celebrities here at North Shore.

72
00:04:15.548 --> 00:04:19.135
One of our lunch ladies was on
the first season of American Idol.

73
00:04:19.336 --> 00:04:21.972
- Good to know.
- Yeah, it was pretty hot.

74
00:04:22.257 --> 00:04:25.110
And, uh... we're also aware
of your many moves.

75
00:04:25.111 --> 00:04:26.010
Okay.

76
00:04:26.011 --> 00:04:28.313
'Cause we're aware that students
who move around a lot...

77
00:04:28.414 --> 00:04:32.382
often wind up as
serial killers or actors.

78
00:04:32.483 --> 00:04:35.470
Hey, did I mention we have
an excellent drama department?

79
00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:36.970
I'm not really
into drama,

80
00:04:37.071 --> 00:04:39.742
but I do know you have
an advanced shop class.

81
00:04:39.843 --> 00:04:44.127
Ah, menial laborer
rather than intellectual.

82
00:04:44.228 --> 00:04:46.029
I can respect that.

83
00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.666
Um, the cheerleading squad

84
00:04:48.851 --> 00:04:52.554
will be going to the public
library for a field trip.

85
00:04:52.655 --> 00:04:55.591
Now, last year, we had
some problems with that,

86
00:04:55.693 --> 00:04:58.392
where we had 12 girls go,

87
00:04:58.493 --> 00:05:00.796
and we had 15 girls come back.

88
00:05:02.566 --> 00:05:04.099
I know
how much you all love vampires,

89
00:05:04.201 --> 00:05:06.703
but remember,
the school nurse will be...

90
00:05:06.804 --> 00:05:11.039
heading up the blood drive,
so sign up for that now.

91
00:05:13.044 --> 00:05:15.961
Home Ec's down the hall, miss.

92
00:05:16.062 --> 00:05:19.233
Actually, as refreshingly
sexist as that is,

93
00:05:19.334 --> 00:05:21.235
I'm here for Advanced Shop.

94
00:05:21.336 --> 00:05:24.504
- Drafting class.
- Right.

95
00:05:24.772 --> 00:05:27.073
Well, we lost Mike to that
circular saw incident,

96
00:05:27.174 --> 00:05:29.777
so you can be
Tyler's partner.

97
00:05:29.978 --> 00:05:32.862
OK, everybody, get started
on your birdhouses.

98
00:05:33.165 --> 00:05:35.500
Trusses or triangles,
I don't care.

99
00:05:35.702 --> 00:05:39.085
That's about all
I can deal with right now.

100
00:05:40.238 --> 00:05:42.422
- Hey, Tyler, I'm Jo.
- Hey.

101
00:05:42.523 --> 00:05:45.861
- What's his deal?
- Well, uh, Mr. Giamatti...

102
00:05:45.962 --> 00:05:48.964
bleeds Texas A&M maroon and
white, and they lost Saturday.

103
00:05:49.064 --> 00:05:50.840
Well, if they want
to be taken seriously,

104
00:05:50.845 --> 00:05:52.100
they better beat
the Longhorns.

105
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.400
Don't let Giamatti hear
you say that...

106
00:05:53.535 --> 00:05:57.155
And just
when a guy seems all dreamy...

107
00:05:57.256 --> 00:05:59.975
and has eyes
you can fall into...

108
00:06:00.076 --> 00:06:02.645
So we have to build
a lame birdhouse. Um...

109
00:06:02.746 --> 00:06:04.479
I guess you could decorate it.

110
00:06:06.299 --> 00:06:09.018
He opens his mouth
and sounds like an ass.

111
00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:12.221
Wow, thanks.

112
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:14.574
But I was thinking I could...

113
00:06:14.675 --> 00:06:16.610
carve the dovetail joint.

114
00:06:16.711 --> 00:06:19.311
- I'm impressed.
- That makes one of us.

115
00:06:23.652 --> 00:06:26.552
In every school,
students have their lunch gang.

116
00:06:26.653 --> 00:06:31.659
As my dad says, your racer is
only as good as your pit crew.

117
00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:34.660
Cutest dog ever, Mandi!

118
00:06:34.762 --> 00:06:38.131
Thanks! Coco Chanel really
sets off my new purse.

119
00:06:38.232 --> 00:06:40.235
You had her checked
for rabies, right?

120
00:06:40.335 --> 00:06:42.837
Too bad you couldn't get the new
Prada bag with the fringe.

121
00:06:42.938 --> 00:06:44.440
Would've totally
matched her brown fur.

122
00:06:44.541 --> 00:06:46.389
Hello! Fringe is so out.

123
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:47.975
And I'm at the top
of the wait list

124
00:06:47.988 --> 00:06:50.262
for the new, patent leather
Prada satchel.

125
00:06:50.363 --> 00:06:53.164
But you've already waited, like,
six months for the fringe...

126
00:06:53.265 --> 00:06:56.036
Of course, Mandi,
fringe is so past tense.

127
00:06:56.137 --> 00:06:58.520
Vogue says crimson
is the new accessory,

128
00:06:58.621 --> 00:07:00.120
and you're totally
gonna rock that look.

129
00:07:00.221 --> 00:07:02.106
Oh, I know.

130
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:05.844
Lost much, little freshies?
Scram.

131
00:07:05.945 --> 00:07:08.080
Ten dogs in a minute.
Let's do this!

132
00:07:08.181 --> 00:07:09.781
You guys are goin' down.
We're gonna win, come on.

133
00:07:09.882 --> 00:07:12.901
- Yeah. Yeah, let's go, let's go.
- Come on.

134
00:07:13.202 --> 00:07:14.786
- Nick, focus!
- Come on, man.

135
00:07:14.887 --> 00:07:16.788
Chastity, stop drooling.

136
00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:18.925
You know what Mandi
thinks about you and Tyler.

137
00:07:19.026 --> 00:07:22.261
What are you talking about?

138
00:07:22.362 --> 00:07:24.665
Do not play dumb with me.

139
00:07:24.766 --> 00:07:27.616
I don't have to play dumb.

140
00:07:27.717 --> 00:07:30.703
Besides, the cashier
totally sneezed on your salad.

141
00:07:30.804 --> 00:07:33.372
Ew!

142
00:07:37.646 --> 00:07:39.748
- Ugh!
- Pay up, you two losers.

143
00:07:42.849 --> 00:07:45.219
Ugh, God,
Nick is just so nasty.

144
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.412
I'm only dating him
'cause he's probably

145
00:07:46.445 --> 00:07:48.174
getting a full ride
to UCLA.

146
00:07:48.474 --> 00:07:49.908
You know, one week
in LA and I'll be...

147
00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:53.212
a bikini model-hyphen-reality
star-hyphen-awesome!

148
00:07:53.313 --> 00:07:55.913
- I heard Amy Hall is totally into
him. - Oh, she wouldn't dare.

149
00:07:56.014 --> 00:08:00.352
Nickie, over here.
I missed you.

150
00:08:02.255 --> 00:08:06.157
- Hey, babe. - Hey, have you
been lifting weights?

151
00:08:06.258 --> 00:08:08.994
Oh, dude, your rat-dog
just tongued me.

152
00:08:09.095 --> 00:08:12.064
Shut up, Nick. You'll hurt
Coco Chanel's feelings.

153
00:08:12.065 --> 00:08:15.150
- Aah!
- No groping south of the equator.

154
00:08:15.151 --> 00:08:18.988
Or north, creep.

155
00:08:19.089 --> 00:08:21.973
Wow, the hot chick can
really handle herself.

156
00:08:22.074 --> 00:08:26.179
Wonder what else she can handle.

157
00:08:30.033 --> 00:08:33.036
- Who the hell is she?
- Her name is Jo, Jo Mitchell.

158
00:08:33.138 --> 00:08:34.673
She's in my bio class.

159
00:08:34.774 --> 00:08:38.073
Somebody said she came somewhere,
from, like, Florida or Texas.

160
00:08:38.174 --> 00:08:41.812
Then I also heard that she's
an exchange student from Russia.

161
00:08:41.913 --> 00:08:44.616
Oh, what did they
exchange her for?

162
00:08:47.036 --> 00:08:48.803
She's kinda pretty,
don't you think?

163
00:08:48.904 --> 00:08:52.539
Well,
if you're into pleather.

164
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.326
Hello, there.
Hi, Coco Chanel.

165
00:08:55.427 --> 00:09:00.782
Go back to Mandi, go on.
Go, go, go.

166
00:09:00.917 --> 00:09:03.417
All right, just a little bit.

167
00:09:05.772 --> 00:09:08.224
Where's Coco Chanel?

168
00:09:10.259 --> 00:09:12.378
Bad little girl.

169
00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:24.774
Oh, my God! Who did that?

170
00:09:24.875 --> 00:09:27.226
- Who fed Coco Chanel?
- It was Abby.

171
00:09:27.327 --> 00:09:30.613
- Abby did it.
- You? Again?

172
00:09:32.749 --> 00:09:36.169
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
I'm really sorry, Mandi!

173
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:38.171
I'll buy you another purse.

174
00:09:38.272 --> 00:09:39.941
Or you can just have mine.

175
00:09:40.042 --> 00:09:41.709
Is that what I think it is?

176
00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:44.627
- Uh-oh, duck.
- I love ducks.

177
00:09:44.728 --> 00:09:47.564
It's, um,
the Prada fringe purse.

178
00:09:47.665 --> 00:09:50.250
My dad got it for me
last month, but...

179
00:09:50.352 --> 00:09:54.573
Last month? Ugh, just go!

180
00:09:56.143 --> 00:09:59.676
- Aah!
- Oh!

181
00:09:59.777 --> 00:10:02.898
Stay down there,
and don't ever look at me again.

182
00:10:02.999 --> 00:10:06.752
Better yet, don't even
breathe the same air.

183
00:10:24.737 --> 00:10:28.274
Hey. Well, how was it?

184
00:10:28.375 --> 00:10:31.526
I saw a girl become
roadkill in the cafeteria.

185
00:10:31.628 --> 00:10:33.329
Gotta love high school.

186
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:36.768
Speaking of my escape, has my
Carnegie Mellon application arrived?

187
00:10:36.869 --> 00:10:38.450
Hey, you know,
I was lookin' today,

188
00:10:38.551 --> 00:10:39.988
and I saw that
the University of Ohio

189
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:42.289
has a great architectural
program.

190
00:10:42.389 --> 00:10:44.257
You could stay close
to home,

191
00:10:44.358 --> 00:10:48.897
transform Toledo into an
architectural wonderland.

192
00:10:49.732 --> 00:10:51.300
Dad, what's going on?

193
00:10:51.401 --> 00:10:53.967
I'm applying early decision
to Carnegie Mellon.

194
00:10:54.068 --> 00:10:55.835
Eh, what do you wanna
go there for, huh?

195
00:10:55.936 --> 00:10:59.339
They don't even have a good mascot.
I mean, a Scottish terrier.

196
00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:00.908
Who's gonna be
intimidated by that?

197
00:11:01.009 --> 00:11:03.295
Plus, you, uh...

198
00:11:03.396 --> 00:11:06.329
You qualify
for in-state tuition here.

199
00:11:07.215 --> 00:11:08.899
Oh, my God.

200
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.052
What happened to my tuition?!

201
00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:17.860
Aw, Jo...
Look, I'm sorry.

202
00:11:17.962 --> 00:11:20.194
I kept hoping that
the market would rebound,

203
00:11:20.295 --> 00:11:21.905
but my investments
are in the tank,

204
00:11:21.912 --> 00:11:23.684
and now NASCAR sponsors
have cut spending...

205
00:11:23.784 --> 00:11:26.619
Then make them
un-cut spending!

206
00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.256
Mom went to Carnegie Mellon,
I... I have to go there.

207
00:11:29.357 --> 00:11:32.693
- She loved it!
- I know, I know.

208
00:11:32.794 --> 00:11:34.777
I'm sorry I let you down.

209
00:11:36.663 --> 00:11:41.268
I know you're disappointed,
Jo, and that's OK.

210
00:11:43.004 --> 00:11:45.508
Honey, you don't always
have to be so strong.

211
00:11:47.108 --> 00:11:50.543
Strong?
I was trying not to panic.

212
00:11:50.644 --> 00:11:52.813
But when you've moved
as much as I have,

213
00:11:52.914 --> 00:11:54.540
you kinda get attached
to the idea

214
00:11:54.545 --> 00:11:57.787
of settling down
in one place for 4 years.

215
00:11:57.987 --> 00:12:01.521
In this case,
my mother's alma mater.

216
00:12:01.622 --> 00:12:05.860
My dad and I have been
on our own for a long time.

217
00:12:05.961 --> 00:12:07.829
My mom died before I was one.

218
00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:13.135
So life wasn't exactly your typical
warm and fuzzy greeting card.

219
00:12:13.236 --> 00:12:17.572
But I wasn't the only one
in my own personal hell.

220
00:12:17.739 --> 00:12:21.227
Abby was hoping that her
swollen, black ankle...

221
00:12:21.328 --> 00:12:26.149
might be enough for Mandi to forget
about her dog's infamous upchuck.

222
00:12:29.486 --> 00:12:30.753
And it might have been,

223
00:12:30.854 --> 00:12:34.390
if not for the
two's long history.

224
00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.927
Jealousy is a funny thing.

225
00:12:38.028 --> 00:12:40.731
They had lived across
from each other for years.

226
00:12:40.966 --> 00:12:44.734
And while Mandi, seemingly,
had everything,

227
00:12:44.835 --> 00:12:46.819
Abby had more.
She had two parents...

228
00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:50.073
who went a little overboard
for their darling Abby.

229
00:12:50.174 --> 00:12:54.479
First, there was the infamous
moon bounce war at age five.

230
00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:56.830
Mandi's was cool,

231
00:12:56.931 --> 00:12:59.683
but Abby's
was three stories high.

232
00:12:59.784 --> 00:13:02.219
Yay!

233
00:13:03.538 --> 00:13:06.241
Then, the French Revolution
Halloween meltdown...

234
00:13:06.393 --> 00:13:07.694
at age 11.

235
00:13:07.795 --> 00:13:11.060
Mandi flaunted her
store-bought peasant costume,

236
00:13:11.161 --> 00:13:14.099
until she spotted Abby's
utterly perfect,

237
00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:17.986
hand-stitched,
Marie Antoinette royal gown.

238
00:13:20.807 --> 00:13:25.344
And finally, the great bra
incident of junior high.

239
00:13:25.445 --> 00:13:27.246
- Hi, Mandi.
- Hi.

240
00:13:27.347 --> 00:13:31.051
Well, that had more
to do with nature.

241
00:13:31.252 --> 00:13:34.437
Still, Mandi might have
found someone else to hate,

242
00:13:34.538 --> 00:13:38.341
if Abby hadn't
done the unthinkable.

243
00:13:41.446 --> 00:13:44.646
Mandi, oh, my God! Someone has
a better parking space than us.

244
00:13:44.747 --> 00:13:48.202
Hey, babe, who snagged
the plush disabled spot?

245
00:13:48.303 --> 00:13:50.102
I guess you're number two now.

246
00:13:50.203 --> 00:13:52.839
Two? Two?

247
00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:55.958
Mandi hated
being number two.

248
00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:02.618
- This is war.
- Oh, God.

249
00:14:05.853 --> 00:14:08.405
- Elliot, we need a little favor.
- Sure.

250
00:14:08.506 --> 00:14:11.576
Chastity.

251
00:14:11.878 --> 00:14:15.331
- Hey.
- Anything.

252
00:14:15.532 --> 00:14:17.496
- You're on the Web team, right?
- Of course.

253
00:14:17.597 --> 00:14:19.650
Trained in Java and C++.

254
00:14:19.752 --> 00:14:22.253
I also have my Math Club Card,
Hacker Membership, Journalist Pass,

255
00:14:22.354 --> 00:14:27.559
- and I do a little salsa
for the ladies. - Oh!

256
00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.128
How can I be of service?

257
00:14:30.131 --> 00:14:34.417
Oops.

258
00:14:34.518 --> 00:14:38.187
- Sorry.
- Oh, gross!

259
00:14:38.288 --> 00:14:40.347
Abby Scabby's face
looks as red and pussy

260
00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:42.527
as it did
in seventh grade.

261
00:14:42.827 --> 00:14:44.494
Zit cream much?

262
00:14:44.694 --> 00:14:48.931
Mandi was creative,
ruthless, unrelenting.

263
00:14:49.033 --> 00:14:53.353
- I'd seen her kind before.
- Need a napkin?

264
00:14:59.527 --> 00:15:03.197
And this was
just the beginning.

265
00:15:05.933 --> 00:15:07.735
Brutal.

266
00:15:12.407 --> 00:15:13.830
You know, most girls
would have laughed,

267
00:15:13.933 --> 00:15:16.545
texted back
or posted a status update.

268
00:15:16.645 --> 00:15:18.747
Do I look like
most girls?

269
00:15:29.541 --> 00:15:31.177
Oh, God.

270
00:15:31.679 --> 00:15:33.445
What a paint job!

271
00:15:40.219 --> 00:15:42.287
Need another one?

272
00:15:49.363 --> 00:15:51.665
Hey, Abby, let me
give you a ride home.

273
00:15:52.868 --> 00:15:53.933
I don't bite.

274
00:16:06.332 --> 00:16:09.466
- Nice house.
- Thanks.

275
00:16:16.859 --> 00:16:20.911
Abby? Honey, what's wrong?

276
00:16:35.961 --> 00:16:39.330
- May I help you?
- Oh, hi.

277
00:16:39.432 --> 00:16:43.102
I gave Abby a ride home from
school, and she dropped this.

278
00:16:43.203 --> 00:16:45.505
What happened to Abby's car?
Did she have an accident?

279
00:16:45.606 --> 00:16:47.574
She had an accident,
didn't she? Was she hurt?

280
00:16:47.675 --> 00:16:51.577
No, it wasn't an accident.
It was just some girls at school.

281
00:16:51.678 --> 00:16:55.080
Again? I knew we should have
sent her to St. Mary's.

282
00:16:55.181 --> 00:16:59.621
Right. Well, tell Abby,
Jo said goodbye.

283
00:17:04.392 --> 00:17:05.624
She's a wreck.

284
00:17:05.725 --> 00:17:08.662
Our poor baby, she keeps saying
that everybody hates her.

285
00:17:08.931 --> 00:17:11.433
I'll buy her some new clothes,
a week at a spa.

286
00:17:11.534 --> 00:17:14.020
Money's not gonna
fix this, Sidney.

287
00:17:14.121 --> 00:17:17.955
She's sobbing her eyes out,
and I don't know what to do.

288
00:17:18.056 --> 00:17:20.859
If only she had some friends.

289
00:17:33.289 --> 00:17:35.090
Listen, Jo, she's devastated.

290
00:17:35.191 --> 00:17:38.860
But it's her senior year,
and I want it to be perfect.

291
00:17:38.962 --> 00:17:41.131
I mean,
just look at that face.

292
00:17:41.232 --> 00:17:43.264
She needs you. We need you.

293
00:17:43.365 --> 00:17:44.932
And we're willing to pay.

294
00:17:45.033 --> 00:17:48.955
- What?
- For you to be her friend.

295
00:17:49.057 --> 00:17:52.226
Two, three, 4,000
to get you started.

296
00:17:52.327 --> 00:17:54.511
- You're crazy.
- Wait, please.

297
00:17:54.612 --> 00:17:57.045
I have more money
than I know what to do with.

298
00:17:57.146 --> 00:17:59.816
And if I can't buy my daughter's
happiness, then what is it worth?

299
00:17:59.917 --> 00:18:04.038
- You can't buy friends.
- OK. Don't call it a friend.

300
00:18:04.139 --> 00:18:09.278
Call it her bodyguard,
guardian angel, fairy god-sister.

301
00:18:10.227 --> 00:18:12.196
There must be
something you want.

302
00:18:12.297 --> 00:18:14.532
Some dream I can
help come true.

303
00:18:14.633 --> 00:18:18.802
A new car?
A trip to Europe? College?

304
00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:22.992
College.

305
00:18:23.093 --> 00:18:25.975
Today's economy,
it's rough out there.

306
00:18:26.076 --> 00:18:30.766
You need money for college,
and it isn't cheap.

307
00:18:30.867 --> 00:18:32.518
- Let me pay for yours.
- Forget it.

308
00:18:32.619 --> 00:18:35.153
Look, just try it out
for 30 days, risk-free.

309
00:18:35.254 --> 00:18:37.421
I guarantee you'll
be happy you did.

310
00:18:37.522 --> 00:18:40.858
And just for trying, I'll buy your
college books for freshman year,

311
00:18:40.959 --> 00:18:42.881
which are yours to keep,
no questions asked,

312
00:18:43.082 --> 00:18:45.382
as my little gift
to you.

313
00:18:47.751 --> 00:18:49.718
Sidney
was pretty convincing,

314
00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:51.886
and I should have
realized why.

315
00:18:51.988 --> 00:18:54.690
He was the king
of infomercials.

316
00:18:54.791 --> 00:18:58.227
He could sell anything from
meat juicers to cat toilets...

317
00:18:58.329 --> 00:19:00.230
to my college tuition.

318
00:19:00.332 --> 00:19:01.832
I knew it was crazy.

319
00:19:01.933 --> 00:19:04.102
But Abby'd have
a good senior year,

320
00:19:04.203 --> 00:19:08.472
and I'd get my dream of
Carnegie Mellon University.

321
00:19:09.774 --> 00:19:12.976
I figured, who would it hurt?

322
00:19:14.462 --> 00:19:15.897
Four hundred people
already viewed it.

323
00:19:15.998 --> 00:19:18.280
That computer geek
lived up to his promise.

324
00:19:18.381 --> 00:19:21.734
Which is like a rarity in life,
that anyone ever comes through.

325
00:19:21.835 --> 00:19:23.669
Especially fathers and doctors.

326
00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:26.074
Not my legs,
Chastity, my face.

327
00:19:26.175 --> 00:19:30.311
I'm getting all
red and splotchy. Ugh.

328
00:19:30.412 --> 00:19:31.814
- Uh-oh.
- What?

329
00:19:31.915 --> 00:19:34.464
You're never
gonna believe this.

330
00:19:34.565 --> 00:19:35.766
What do you mean?

331
00:19:35.867 --> 00:19:38.803
Someone posted a link on
your page to another video.

332
00:19:38.904 --> 00:19:43.009
Look, it's that new girl, Jo.
She totally bailed Abby out.

333
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:47.278
Ugh, who is this girl?
Some bad-ass biker chick?

334
00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:50.633
- There's tons of comments.
- Ugh.

335
00:19:50.734 --> 00:19:55.371
- All the guys think she's hot.
- OK.

336
00:19:56.574 --> 00:19:58.342
So she's hot.

337
00:19:58.444 --> 00:20:00.309
She's well-connected.

338
00:20:00.411 --> 00:20:02.879
I mean, she's
pretty much one of us.

339
00:20:02.979 --> 00:20:05.149
So we'll just need
to make it very clear that,

340
00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:08.684
from here on out, she's only
nice to the people we like.

341
00:20:08.786 --> 00:20:12.139
Agreed?

342
00:20:17.777 --> 00:20:20.415
Mandi, can I get a quote
from you on the school play,

343
00:20:20.516 --> 00:20:22.617
or the lacrosse team, or just,
like, anything, really?

344
00:20:22.718 --> 00:20:26.121
God, I am not up for the
paparazzi this morning.

345
00:20:29.257 --> 00:20:31.943
It's so embarrassing
how much they love me.

346
00:20:32.044 --> 00:20:35.346
I'm Mandi, with an "i".
And you're Jo, right?

347
00:20:35.447 --> 00:20:37.917
- That's me.
- So, Jo, since you're new here,

348
00:20:38.018 --> 00:20:41.168
I thought we'd help you out,
let you know who to hang out with.

349
00:20:41.368 --> 00:20:43.690
- Us.
- The real welcoming committee...

350
00:20:43.691 --> 00:20:44.591
had arrived.

351
00:20:44.891 --> 00:20:48.028
- And who not to.
- Did I say "welcoming"?

352
00:20:48.129 --> 00:20:52.097
Uh, oh, wow.

353
00:20:52.199 --> 00:20:53.734
Thanks.

354
00:20:53.836 --> 00:20:56.535
But I think I can
figure that out on my own.

355
00:20:56.636 --> 00:21:00.907
Really? Well, I... I haven't
been impressed so far.

356
00:21:01.008 --> 00:21:03.743
- Excuse me?
- But I'm a benevolent dictator,

357
00:21:03.844 --> 00:21:06.425
so why don't we discuss
over a non-fat,

358
00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:08.532
no-sugar
raspberry Frappuccino...

359
00:21:08.632 --> 00:21:11.167
- at the coffee joint?
- We only use Skinny-and-Sweet.

360
00:21:11.269 --> 00:21:13.535
It's like cellulite in a straw,
but without the cellulite.

361
00:21:13.637 --> 00:21:16.305
As scientifically interesting
as that sounds,

362
00:21:16.406 --> 00:21:17.725
I'll have to pass.

363
00:21:17.826 --> 00:21:21.279
Oh, it wasn't a question.

364
00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:24.781
Oops. Guess I answered anyway.

365
00:21:27.286 --> 00:21:28.302
Oh, my God. Hi.

366
00:21:28.403 --> 00:21:31.039
I'm Quinn Shinn,
editor of the school paper.

367
00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:35.077
That was unbelievable.
Nobody turns Mandi down.

368
00:21:35.177 --> 00:21:38.546
- I just didn't feel like going.
- You're kidding, right?

369
00:21:38.647 --> 00:21:42.652
No, the Plastics are goddesses.
And Mandi can, like, ruin you.

370
00:21:42.752 --> 00:21:44.987
I wrote one article
on school uniforms,

371
00:21:45.088 --> 00:21:47.756
and she put strawberries
in my yogurt.

372
00:21:47.857 --> 00:21:49.691
How horrible for you?

373
00:21:49.792 --> 00:21:52.427
Oh, I had an allergic reaction
to the strawberries,

374
00:21:52.528 --> 00:21:56.731
swelled up like a big Arothron
hispidus. That's a blowfish.

375
00:21:56.833 --> 00:21:59.235
Be careful, Jo.

376
00:21:59.336 --> 00:22:02.736
Thanks, but I'm
not that worried.

377
00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:12.214
Hey, what's up?

378
00:22:12.315 --> 00:22:15.319
So you dropped your notebook,
but I gave it back to your dad.

379
00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:18.121
Pretty cool sketches.
Are you an artist?

380
00:22:18.222 --> 00:22:22.259
Look, it's cool, I get it.
You don't have to...

381
00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:25.513
- Get what?
- Principal Duvall sent you.

382
00:22:25.614 --> 00:22:28.933
But look, the welcoming committee
was just a stupid idea.

383
00:22:29.035 --> 00:22:31.353
I mean, really, you're the first
new student here in ages,

384
00:22:31.454 --> 00:22:33.753
so you're off the hook.

385
00:22:33.855 --> 00:22:36.774
- Thanks for the ride, though.
- Sure.

386
00:22:40.647 --> 00:22:44.815
Registration
for AP test has closed.

387
00:22:44.916 --> 00:22:46.884
Now...

388
00:22:46.986 --> 00:22:49.855
Uh, now, we all know the
tradition here at North Shore...

389
00:22:49.956 --> 00:22:54.394
is to, uh, use
the Homecoming Dance...

390
00:22:54.495 --> 00:22:58.863
to fund-raise
for charity, okay?

391
00:23:01.768 --> 00:23:03.336
'Cause otherwise you all
would just think...

392
00:23:03.437 --> 00:23:06.038
the world revolves around
you and football.

393
00:23:06.139 --> 00:23:09.594
And it doesn't, OK?

394
00:23:09.695 --> 00:23:11.209
I told you not to walk
in front of...

395
00:23:11.311 --> 00:23:13.712
Babe, I already chose your
tuxedo, rented the limo and...

396
00:23:13.813 --> 00:23:16.750
Oh, red rose corsage,
not a frigging carnation.

397
00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:19.220
Mandi, you are so winning
Homecoming Queen.

398
00:23:19.221 --> 00:23:20.221
Totally winning.

399
00:23:21.022 --> 00:23:23.924
The school nurse
will be heading up the blood drive,

400
00:23:24.025 --> 00:23:26.126
- so sign up for that now.
- Please.

401
00:23:26.227 --> 00:23:30.563
Like I'm letting that petri dish
of a clinic stick a needle in me.

402
00:23:30.831 --> 00:23:33.400
I know!
And no matter what I said...

403
00:23:33.503 --> 00:23:36.339
Hey, uh... do you know
where I could catch the bus?

404
00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:38.041
I think it just left.

405
00:23:38.141 --> 00:23:41.642
Classic. This is why I really
need to fix my bike today.

406
00:23:41.743 --> 00:23:43.100
Do you know any good
auto parts shops?

407
00:23:43.125 --> 00:23:45.414
I've gotta get
a new spark plug.

408
00:23:46.414 --> 00:23:48.410
Well, I... I think
there's Pete's Auto

409
00:23:48.415 --> 00:23:50.020
right next
to the coffee joint.

410
00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:52.352
I could give you
a ride if you want.

411
00:23:52.453 --> 00:23:54.956
I mean, I really
owe you one anyway.

412
00:23:55.056 --> 00:23:57.191
Sweet, thanks.

413
00:24:04.852 --> 00:24:06.568
Oh, look, it's Jo!
Hey, Jo!

414
00:24:06.736 --> 00:24:11.841
- Hey.
- She's with Abby Hanover!

415
00:24:11.942 --> 00:24:13.693
Hi.

416
00:24:31.447 --> 00:24:33.013
Thanks for the lift.

417
00:24:35.116 --> 00:24:36.482
Do you wanna come inside?

418
00:24:36.583 --> 00:24:40.688
I'll probably break something,
but... but sure.

419
00:24:48.011 --> 00:24:52.182
- Who's that?
- Um, my mom.

420
00:24:54.287 --> 00:24:55.921
She's really pretty.

421
00:24:58.891 --> 00:25:01.825
Yeah. She was.

422
00:25:05.248 --> 00:25:08.867
- What are these?
- Um...

423
00:25:08.969 --> 00:25:11.790
That's the Sydney Harbor
Bridge and a skyscraper

424
00:25:11.807 --> 00:25:12.957
I've been designing.

425
00:25:13.157 --> 00:25:16.008
Kind of hard to tell,
I'm a crappy artist.

426
00:25:16.209 --> 00:25:18.729
- I could help, if you want.
- Really?

427
00:25:19.113 --> 00:25:22.699
Uh, you're pretty talented,
based on those sketches I saw.

428
00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:24.918
You should see
my paintings sometime.

429
00:25:25.019 --> 00:25:27.788
Uh, actually, you don't have to.
It's a bad idea...

430
00:25:27.889 --> 00:25:31.174
No, that'd be really cool.

431
00:25:31.442 --> 00:25:34.811
OK. You ready to
go change a spark plug?

432
00:25:42.503 --> 00:25:45.972
My gosh,
is that a friend?

433
00:25:46.073 --> 00:25:47.674
Maybe you were right.

434
00:25:47.775 --> 00:25:50.412
Girls aren't
so bad after all.

435
00:25:52.015 --> 00:25:54.651
Hello, Mr. Winkle!

436
00:25:54.752 --> 00:25:56.340
Are those illegal parts?

437
00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:59.071
I'll bet you're running
a chop shop over there.

438
00:25:59.171 --> 00:26:03.041
Well, I've installed security
cameras, and I'll be watching you.

439
00:26:03.142 --> 00:26:07.430
- You hear?
- Goodbye, Mr. Winkle.

440
00:26:21.363 --> 00:26:25.498
Jo Mitchell, you have
no idea how scary I can be.

441
00:26:36.877 --> 00:26:39.863
Hey, Abby! How are you?

442
00:26:39.964 --> 00:26:42.783
Ah!

443
00:26:42.884 --> 00:26:45.686
- I can't get up!
- Are you all right?

444
00:26:45.788 --> 00:26:48.457
I don't know.
Pull me as hard as you can.

445
00:26:48.559 --> 00:26:49.659
OK.

446
00:26:54.964 --> 00:26:58.049
- Now what?
- Uh, help me up.

447
00:26:58.150 --> 00:26:59.985
OK.

448
00:27:01.655 --> 00:27:05.056
Seriously? Who would ever
think of something so childish,

449
00:27:05.157 --> 00:27:09.061
yet brilliant,
except a bunch of mean girls?

450
00:27:10.196 --> 00:27:12.649
- Hey, Mandi.
- Hi.

451
00:27:15.802 --> 00:27:17.024
Now, what do we do?

452
00:27:17.224 --> 00:27:19.823
I would've strangled her
right there...

453
00:27:19.923 --> 00:27:21.207
Meet me in the bathroom.

454
00:27:21.308 --> 00:27:23.510
Bring any spare clothes
that you have.

455
00:27:23.611 --> 00:27:26.278
if I could get off the Vespa.

456
00:27:28.082 --> 00:27:31.416
Wow. Bad-ass!

457
00:27:31.517 --> 00:27:34.354
So cool.

458
00:27:34.455 --> 00:27:36.123
Coming through!

459
00:27:38.693 --> 00:27:40.360
Sorry!

460
00:27:41.596 --> 00:27:42.896
Are you okay?

461
00:27:44.434 --> 00:27:45.582
This is all my fault.

462
00:27:45.683 --> 00:27:47.184
You should've never
hung out with me.

463
00:27:47.285 --> 00:27:48.953
Mandi's gonna make
your life a living hell.

464
00:27:49.054 --> 00:27:50.687
Abby, you can't live in fear.

465
00:27:50.788 --> 00:27:54.360
- Did you find me something to wear?
- Just my art smock.

466
00:27:54.461 --> 00:27:56.963
That'll have to do.
Thanks.

467
00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:02.667
- Do you need my help?
- I think I got it.

468
00:28:04.337 --> 00:28:06.372
- How do I look?
- Great.

469
00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:12.093
- Hey, nice look.
- It's not funny.

470
00:28:12.194 --> 00:28:16.232
- I'm not joking, it's hot.
- Thanks.

471
00:28:21.338 --> 00:28:24.441
No unauthorized videos
of my students on the monitor.

472
00:28:24.942 --> 00:28:26.043
By the next day,

473
00:28:26.044 --> 00:28:29.244
I hoped everyone would've forgotten
about my wardrobe malfunction,

474
00:28:29.245 --> 00:28:31.331
but it wasn't
what I was expecting.

475
00:28:31.432 --> 00:28:33.020
Apparently,
holding your head high

476
00:28:33.025 --> 00:28:36.487
after a Mandi vendetta
earned you points.

477
00:28:45.713 --> 00:28:50.068
- Oh, my gosh, this is so cool!
- You started it.

478
00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:52.187
It was your smock.

479
00:28:55.958 --> 00:28:58.776
- It's cute.
- It's pathetic.

480
00:28:58.877 --> 00:29:03.582
I could smear paint all over my
Versace, but I have taste, style.

481
00:29:03.684 --> 00:29:05.469
They're just sheep.

482
00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:06.918
Chastity, make out
with the student intern

483
00:29:06.925 --> 00:29:09.388
in the front office,
get Jo's file.

484
00:29:09.688 --> 00:29:11.591
Hope, stalk her.

485
00:29:11.692 --> 00:29:13.459
I want to know everything.

486
00:29:26.072 --> 00:29:27.974
Wow, this is amazing.

487
00:29:28.043 --> 00:29:30.943
You shouldn't waste your
talent on sketches for me.

488
00:29:31.045 --> 00:29:33.547
Oh, I don't mind.

489
00:29:33.648 --> 00:29:34.797
All right, what
should we work on first?

490
00:29:34.898 --> 00:29:37.550
Um, well, I love
building cars with my dad,

491
00:29:37.651 --> 00:29:39.767
but I wanna...
I wanna design something

492
00:29:39.769 --> 00:29:41.989
more lasting and permanent.

493
00:29:42.089 --> 00:29:45.927
I.M. Pei, for instance,
designs the most amazing buildings,

494
00:29:46.028 --> 00:29:48.762
- and Joseph Strauss...
- Built the Golden Gate Bridge.

495
00:29:48.863 --> 00:29:52.466
Yeah, my family went there last
summer. It's pretty awesome.

496
00:29:53.167 --> 00:29:55.655
Well, then, why don't we start
with San Francisco?

497
00:29:55.656 --> 00:29:56.956
All right, cool.

498
00:29:57.356 --> 00:30:01.709
Oh, um... yeah, and if my dad
asks, this is a school project.

499
00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:04.495
He thinks artists are,
like, homeless hippies, so...

500
00:30:04.596 --> 00:30:07.299
- I don't wanna get you
in trouble. - Oh, no, no, no!

501
00:30:07.483 --> 00:30:09.984
I need some more samples
for my portfolio anyway.

502
00:30:10.085 --> 00:30:12.087
I'm applying
to NYU Design School.

503
00:30:12.188 --> 00:30:16.758
Or, as I tell my dad,
Columbia Pre-Med.

504
00:30:19.712 --> 00:30:23.983
These are...
They're incredible.

505
00:30:24.085 --> 00:30:26.385
Thanks.

506
00:30:31.557 --> 00:30:33.660
Tyler, late. Sit.

507
00:30:33.761 --> 00:30:35.712
While I was breaking
all my rules with Abby,

508
00:30:35.813 --> 00:30:38.398
I figured I could enjoy
a few other things

509
00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.168
North Shore had to offer.

510
00:30:40.269 --> 00:30:44.388
He could walk in late
any day he wanted.

511
00:31:10.065 --> 00:31:11.532
Hey.

512
00:31:11.632 --> 00:31:13.634
Oh. Hi.

513
00:31:13.735 --> 00:31:16.220
OK, everybody, big day today.

514
00:31:16.405 --> 00:31:21.077
A&M beat Arkansas
in overtime on Saturday. Yes!

515
00:31:21.178 --> 00:31:25.680
Oh, and today, we commence
the great egg-drop project.

516
00:31:25.781 --> 00:31:27.350
Young lady, that is where we drop...

517
00:31:27.351 --> 00:31:29.252
a boiled egg in a parachute
without it breaking.

518
00:31:29.253 --> 00:31:32.389
You'll be judged
on style and structure.

519
00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:33.956
And if you'd just
like to opt out

520
00:31:33.958 --> 00:31:35.426
and bring in deviled eggs
for the class...

521
00:31:35.526 --> 00:31:37.843
Tempting, but doesn't the
top student have the option

522
00:31:37.944 --> 00:31:41.047
to submit for the Thompson-Bird
Architecture scholarship?

523
00:31:41.148 --> 00:31:45.369
Yes, not that any
of you slackers care.

524
00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:50.042
Eligibility for the scholarship
requires a 4.5 GPA,

525
00:31:50.143 --> 00:31:53.878
at least a 2300 on your SATs,
math and verbal,

526
00:31:53.979 --> 00:31:55.947
top scores
on all class projects

527
00:31:56.048 --> 00:32:01.036
and a glowing letter of
recommendation from me.

528
00:32:01.137 --> 00:32:05.021
And as you know, I don't glow often.

529
00:32:08.192 --> 00:32:10.695
Let me guess,
we're gonna have to win.

530
00:32:10.796 --> 00:32:12.397
Pretty much.

531
00:32:12.498 --> 00:32:16.201
Well, then maybe we should
get in some extra study time.

532
00:32:16.302 --> 00:32:18.402
Go to a movie or something?

533
00:32:18.503 --> 00:32:21.572
- Tomorrow night?
- Sounds good.

534
00:32:29.866 --> 00:32:31.734
- Hey!
- Guess what?

535
00:32:31.835 --> 00:32:33.736
Tyler just asked me out.

536
00:32:33.837 --> 00:32:36.472
It was amazing,
having a friend to confide in.

537
00:32:36.574 --> 00:32:38.675
Jo, you can't.
It'd be a big mistake.

538
00:32:38.775 --> 00:32:40.744
- Or not.
- You don't know who he...

539
00:32:40.845 --> 00:32:44.114
He's my shop partner,
and I've seen him without a shirt.

540
00:32:44.216 --> 00:32:46.282
Good enough for me.

541
00:32:56.461 --> 00:32:58.363
Oh, my God!
Tyler is a total traitor.

542
00:32:58.597 --> 00:33:01.332
- She's so crossed the line.
- Who has?

543
00:33:01.433 --> 00:33:05.219
That bitch, Jo.
God, Nick, keep up.

544
00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:07.355
And give me your car keys.

545
00:33:10.659 --> 00:33:11.994
Don't.

546
00:33:13.396 --> 00:33:16.546
- Where you goin'?
- Nowhere. Out with a friend.

547
00:33:16.648 --> 00:33:20.184
Your friend's got a nice car.
And your friend is also a guy.

548
00:33:20.286 --> 00:33:21.953
Goodbye, Dad.
I'll be home by ten.

549
00:33:22.054 --> 00:33:25.325
Nice wheels.

550
00:33:25.426 --> 00:33:26.823
Nick insisted
I borrow his car.

551
00:33:26.924 --> 00:33:29.194
I figured you take cars pretty
seriously, so I took him up on it.

552
00:33:29.296 --> 00:33:31.897
Does that mean
I get to drive?

553
00:33:31.998 --> 00:33:33.499
Yes.

554
00:33:34.735 --> 00:33:37.036
- Oh, thank you.
- After you.

555
00:33:37.137 --> 00:33:39.440
Thank you very much.

556
00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:04.631
I gotta admit, Jo,
you did pretty good.

557
00:34:04.732 --> 00:34:06.801
No screaming
on the roller coaster,

558
00:34:06.902 --> 00:34:08.768
a solid stomach
on the Gravitron.

559
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:11.171
And kicking your ass
at bumper cars.

560
00:34:11.272 --> 00:34:13.707
I like a guy who
can take the heat.

561
00:34:13.808 --> 00:34:15.542
Oh, really?

562
00:34:15.643 --> 00:34:18.331
How many guys
are you looking at?

563
00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:21.367
Come on, Jo.

564
00:34:21.468 --> 00:34:23.367
Four schools in three years?

565
00:34:23.468 --> 00:34:27.072
How many? Six boyfriends?
A dozen?

566
00:34:27.173 --> 00:34:29.142
None.

567
00:34:29.243 --> 00:34:32.411
But I'm sort of breaking
all my rules this year.

568
00:34:32.512 --> 00:34:34.715
You've never
had a boyfriend?

569
00:34:34.816 --> 00:34:37.932
Shut up! So I never
played Spin the Bottle,

570
00:34:38.033 --> 00:34:41.171
I never suffered through
Seven Minutes in Heaven.

571
00:34:41.656 --> 00:34:43.806
Never...

572
00:34:43.907 --> 00:34:45.508
...kissed anyone?

573
00:35:07.050 --> 00:35:09.533
Beginning of the blood drive
this month, so sign up now.

574
00:35:09.634 --> 00:35:12.470
That's it from me,
I'm your principal.

575
00:35:12.571 --> 00:35:14.406
You know me.
I'll see you in the hallways.

576
00:35:14.507 --> 00:35:17.191
Remember, stay left,
or right...

577
00:35:17.292 --> 00:35:19.810
- How'd it go? - Perfect,
you had nothing to worry about.

578
00:35:19.911 --> 00:35:21.678
Hello, North Shore,

579
00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:24.200
last night,
our new girl Jo Mitchell...

580
00:35:24.301 --> 00:35:26.619
had a first date, and more.

581
00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:30.439
Come on, Jo. How many?
Six boyfriends? A dozen?

582
00:35:30.572 --> 00:35:34.310
None. But I'm sort of breaking
all my rules this year.

583
00:35:34.411 --> 00:35:37.628
Oh, God. This isn't happening.

584
00:35:37.729 --> 00:35:39.950
- You've never had a boyfriend?
- Shut up!

585
00:35:40.051 --> 00:35:42.452
So I never played
Spin the Bottle,

586
00:35:42.635 --> 00:35:46.856
I never suffered through
Seven Minutes in Heaven, I...

587
00:35:46.957 --> 00:35:48.874
Never... kissed anyone?

588
00:35:49.026 --> 00:35:52.195
That's right,
Jo Mitchell is a virgin!

589
00:35:52.296 --> 00:35:55.332
She's a virgin?

590
00:35:57.734 --> 00:36:01.204
Ah, young love.
Isn't it pathetic?

591
00:36:16.704 --> 00:36:20.943
Jo, I'm so sorry.
It's gonna be OK, I promise.

592
00:36:29.919 --> 00:36:32.186
Emergency slumber party?

593
00:36:32.287 --> 00:36:35.008
Thanks, Abby.

594
00:36:36.243 --> 00:36:37.843
You're the best. I'm...

595
00:36:37.944 --> 00:36:39.877
I'm sorry I didn't listen.

596
00:36:39.978 --> 00:36:42.597
And Abby was the best.

597
00:36:42.665 --> 00:36:44.933
Which only made me feel worse.

598
00:36:45.035 --> 00:36:46.536
I was totally lying to her,

599
00:36:46.637 --> 00:36:49.571
the one person who
kept having my back.

600
00:36:49.673 --> 00:36:51.676
Maybe I deserved
Mandi's torture.

601
00:36:51.777 --> 00:36:54.259
Jo, I'm sorry, I didn't...

602
00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:56.163
How could you
set me up like that?

603
00:36:56.264 --> 00:36:59.266
I hope you and Mandi
are very happy together.

604
00:37:00.735 --> 00:37:02.804
I can't believe him!

605
00:37:05.838 --> 00:37:08.342
Jo, how are you holding up?

606
00:37:08.443 --> 00:37:11.978
Elliot wanted to do a story
on virgins in high school,

607
00:37:12.079 --> 00:37:13.764
but I totally nixed it.

608
00:37:14.116 --> 00:37:16.467
- Uh, hi. You're Jo, right?
- Yeah.

609
00:37:16.519 --> 00:37:21.055
Guys. Last year, all 3 of us fell
for this jerk of a senior.

610
00:37:21.156 --> 00:37:23.490
We put out, and he dumped us
the next day.

611
00:37:23.592 --> 00:37:26.211
We should have waited,
like you, for the right guy.

612
00:37:26.311 --> 00:37:28.462
- Yeah, no kidding.
- Yeah.

613
00:37:28.563 --> 00:37:30.648
Tyler wasn't exactly
the right guy.

614
00:37:30.751 --> 00:37:32.752
He was just another one
of Mandi's puppets.

615
00:37:32.853 --> 00:37:35.202
Yeah, well, we just wanted to
tell you we think you're awesome.

616
00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:37.271
- Yeah, definitely.
- See you around.

617
00:37:37.372 --> 00:37:39.341
Thanks!

618
00:37:39.442 --> 00:37:41.010
Why does he even
put up with her?

619
00:37:41.112 --> 00:37:43.162
Why wouldn't he? You can't
choose your siblings.

620
00:37:45.466 --> 00:37:48.650
- What? Siblings?
- I thought he told you.

621
00:37:48.751 --> 00:37:51.220
- Tyler is Mandi's stepbrother.
- I'm such an idiot!

622
00:37:51.321 --> 00:37:56.127
- I thought they were just
hooking up. - Oh, gross!

623
00:37:56.228 --> 00:37:59.797
But now you see why it was so easy
for Mandi to bug your date.

624
00:37:59.898 --> 00:38:02.967
No way, not Tyler. It had
to have been someone else.

625
00:38:03.068 --> 00:38:05.035
Oh, my God.
We were in Nick's car.

626
00:38:05.136 --> 00:38:08.121
- You dick! You bugged the car?
- Come on, man.

627
00:38:08.222 --> 00:38:10.440
- I thought it was fun... - Don't
you turn your back on me, Nick!

628
00:38:10.542 --> 00:38:12.410
What are you gonna do, Tyler?
You're gonna hit your best friend?

629
00:38:12.511 --> 00:38:14.861
- Break it up! That's enough!
- Can't you take a joke?

630
00:38:14.963 --> 00:38:16.730
- I'm gonna mess you up!
- You don't scare me!

631
00:38:16.831 --> 00:38:18.733
You don't scare me.

632
00:38:18.834 --> 00:38:21.134
- Punch me! Bring it on!
- Come on. Are you afraid?

633
00:38:21.235 --> 00:38:22.402
Well, that was fun.

634
00:38:22.503 --> 00:38:24.405
Hope, what else do we
have on the Virgin Queen?

635
00:38:24.506 --> 00:38:28.709
Well, a 4.5 GPA, high SATs,
three AP classes and...

636
00:38:28.743 --> 00:38:31.328
Oh, she's applying for
architecture scholarships.

637
00:38:31.429 --> 00:38:35.049
Her dream,
Carnegie Mellon University.

638
00:38:35.151 --> 00:38:38.704
- Hm.
- OK, so one more time.

639
00:38:38.805 --> 00:38:43.407
She's never made out
with anyone... ever?

640
00:38:43.508 --> 00:38:45.509
Or this week?

641
00:38:47.664 --> 00:38:49.965
Hey, not so fast.

642
00:38:50.066 --> 00:38:52.403
Uh, today's your lucky day.
We got a sale going on.

643
00:38:52.504 --> 00:38:56.137
- 20 percent off all grade changes.
- Look, just leave me alone.

644
00:38:56.238 --> 00:38:58.940
Look, I'm just trying
to say I'm sorry, OK?

645
00:38:59.041 --> 00:39:00.943
I was clouded by lust.

646
00:39:01.044 --> 00:39:05.948
And if it helps, I got kicked off
the Web team for abuse of power.

647
00:39:06.049 --> 00:39:07.853
You're still a jerk.

648
00:39:07.954 --> 00:39:10.854
At least your shirt's funny.

649
00:39:18.864 --> 00:39:23.232
Nice fight in the cafeteria.
I could smell the testosterone.

650
00:39:23.333 --> 00:39:24.785
Does this mean I'm forgiven?

651
00:39:24.886 --> 00:39:28.421
Well, it's not your fault that
your dad married Mandi's mom.

652
00:39:28.522 --> 00:39:32.410
But next time, warn me
that you live with Mandi...

653
00:39:32.511 --> 00:39:34.914
in a totally platonic way.

654
00:39:35.015 --> 00:39:37.915
Wait, you thought...?

655
00:39:38.016 --> 00:39:39.750
Dude, gross!

656
00:39:39.851 --> 00:39:42.521
But despite Quinn
and Abby's urging,

657
00:39:42.622 --> 00:39:45.024
I refused to stoop
to Mandi's level.

658
00:39:45.125 --> 00:39:48.700
Besides, I was having so much
fun with my new friends...

659
00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:50.329
I almost didn't care.

660
00:39:50.429 --> 00:39:51.698
You coming?

661
00:39:54.234 --> 00:39:57.505
Who are those girls?
Do they even go to our school?

662
00:39:57.605 --> 00:39:59.407
I was just looking
at the Homecoming Web site,

663
00:39:59.508 --> 00:40:01.408
and everybody's talking
about the hot, new couple.

664
00:40:01.509 --> 00:40:05.011
Nick and I are the
hottest couple in school.

665
00:40:05.112 --> 00:40:07.247
Not anymore.

666
00:40:18.557 --> 00:40:21.561
So this was it,
the first challenge.

667
00:40:21.662 --> 00:40:23.613
Success was worth 100 points,

668
00:40:23.714 --> 00:40:28.386
and I needed every point I could get
to qualify for the scholarship.

669
00:40:30.406 --> 00:40:34.506
Boiled egg in the structure.
No breaks, no bruises.

670
00:40:35.577 --> 00:40:37.896
- Ready?
- Ready.

671
00:40:37.997 --> 00:40:40.783
And... drop!

672
00:40:44.771 --> 00:40:47.472
OK, who
switched the eggs?

673
00:40:47.573 --> 00:40:50.509
Who? No one?

674
00:40:54.749 --> 00:40:58.301
Oh, well. Who's next?

675
00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:02.505
Mandi had found a new part
of my life to destroy:

676
00:41:02.607 --> 00:41:05.841
my chance at the
Thomson-Bird scholarship.

677
00:41:06.142 --> 00:41:08.779
Our next experiment
didn't go much better.

678
00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:11.532
- You ready?
- Yeah.

679
00:41:13.967 --> 00:41:15.885
Hope called her doctor
on speed dial

680
00:41:15.986 --> 00:41:19.890
and switched our CO2
for laughing gas.

681
00:41:27.131 --> 00:41:29.199
Whoa!

682
00:41:38.594 --> 00:41:40.996
Hey, guys, I'm here.

683
00:41:41.097 --> 00:41:43.264
Seriously, Chastity?

684
00:41:43.365 --> 00:41:45.900
I said "incognito",
not "like a flamingo"!

685
00:41:46.001 --> 00:41:48.738
- Oh.
- Go.

686
00:41:53.708 --> 00:41:56.995
Ew! Ew! Ew! There's poo
on my Jimmy Choo!

687
00:41:57.096 --> 00:41:58.698
Shake it off, shake it off.

688
00:41:59.116 --> 00:42:01.133
Go, slow.

689
00:42:02.335 --> 00:42:03.569
Faster!

690
00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:09.942
Uh, I can't go any further.

691
00:42:10.043 --> 00:42:12.477
What is the matter with you?

692
00:42:22.139 --> 00:42:23.573
Funnel.

693
00:42:24.441 --> 00:42:26.077
The funnel!

694
00:42:26.177 --> 00:42:28.612
- Oh, there you go.
- Right. Secret weapon?

695
00:42:28.714 --> 00:42:32.350
- Oh!
- Hope, a fanny pack, never OK.

696
00:42:48.301 --> 00:42:49.634
Coffee?

697
00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:04.966
Perfect.

698
00:43:22.203 --> 00:43:27.959
- Dad, what's going on?
- It's ruined.

699
00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:30.894
- The whole motor is gummed up.
- What? What happened?

700
00:43:30.995 --> 00:43:34.665
- It was running perfectly
yesterday. - I don't know.

701
00:43:34.766 --> 00:43:38.486
I don't know, maybe
it's the fuel, a faulty part.

702
00:43:38.587 --> 00:43:39.999
It doesn't matter
because Jimmy and the boys

703
00:43:40.005 --> 00:43:42.276
are expecting a trial run
tomorrow.

704
00:43:43.475 --> 00:43:44.959
Dad...

705
00:43:46.227 --> 00:43:47.795
We can figure something out.

706
00:43:47.896 --> 00:43:51.148
There's not enough time,
and there's not enough money.

707
00:43:52.652 --> 00:43:57.388
Maybe I can call in a favor,
uh, beg for an extension,

708
00:43:57.489 --> 00:44:00.091
tell 'em it was some kind of
fluke accident, I don't know.

709
00:44:20.931 --> 00:44:24.383
But this was
definitely no accident.

710
00:44:24.484 --> 00:44:27.086
Mandi had gone too far.

711
00:44:27.188 --> 00:44:28.855
Mess with me, fine.

712
00:44:28.956 --> 00:44:31.659
Mess with my family...

713
00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:33.911
...you're dead.

714
00:44:34.012 --> 00:44:38.316
It was as if all my girl hormones
had kicked into overdrive,

715
00:44:38.417 --> 00:44:41.319
and I was out for blood.

716
00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:42.636
The Plastics were going down,

717
00:44:42.737 --> 00:44:46.674
and I didn't care
what rules I had to break...

718
00:44:46.775 --> 00:44:48.711
to make her pay.

719
00:44:52.397 --> 00:44:55.399
- What happened?
- Mandi happened.

720
00:44:58.304 --> 00:44:59.521
Is that all you got?

721
00:44:59.622 --> 00:45:03.961
Going after my dad,
you spoiled, narcissistic bitch!

722
00:45:04.062 --> 00:45:07.862
That's his job,
not some play-toy for you!

723
00:45:07.963 --> 00:45:10.266
But it was so much fun.

724
00:45:10.367 --> 00:45:14.472
The way I figure it, no job,
no income, no house, no JoJo.

725
00:45:14.573 --> 00:45:18.390
- Right?
- I don't run away that easy.

726
00:45:18.491 --> 00:45:20.927
Get over yourself, man-hands.

727
00:45:21.028 --> 00:45:23.029
You're just a passing phase.

728
00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:24.831
I'm here for the long run.

729
00:45:29.904 --> 00:45:33.573
Oh, yeah?
Are you sure about that?

730
00:45:41.733 --> 00:45:45.320
Ooh! Coffee?

731
00:45:53.212 --> 00:45:57.349
Abby, you don't need
to do this with me.

732
00:45:57.450 --> 00:46:01.785
Of course I do.
It's what best friends are for.

733
00:46:07.043 --> 00:46:09.780
There's something
I need to tell you.

734
00:46:12.133 --> 00:46:15.018
This was it,
the moment to tell Abby

735
00:46:15.119 --> 00:46:18.955
I'd made a deal with her father
that I totally regretted,

736
00:46:19.056 --> 00:46:21.808
and beg for forgiveness.

737
00:46:21.909 --> 00:46:23.377
But looking at her,

738
00:46:23.479 --> 00:46:26.581
the idea of losing my first
best friend in a long time,

739
00:46:26.682 --> 00:46:28.064
I couldn't do it.

740
00:46:28.165 --> 00:46:31.602
So, what do you
need to tell me?

741
00:46:33.771 --> 00:46:37.907
I, um...

742
00:46:38.008 --> 00:46:42.646
You should know, my
last BFF relationship...

743
00:46:42.747 --> 00:46:44.397
crashed and burned.

744
00:46:44.498 --> 00:46:47.652
She became snobby
and judgmental

745
00:46:47.753 --> 00:46:51.072
and used guys
as pawns of warfare,

746
00:46:51.173 --> 00:46:53.225
which is saying a lot,
considering it was fourth grade.

747
00:46:53.326 --> 00:46:58.195
Geez!
Sounds like a mini-Mandi.

748
00:46:58.297 --> 00:47:00.732
But don't worry,
we're nothing like that.

749
00:47:00.833 --> 00:47:03.419
Success! OK.

750
00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:07.140
I grabbed all the archived
papers with the Plastics,

751
00:47:07.241 --> 00:47:10.274
which was pretty much
every issue.

752
00:47:10.375 --> 00:47:14.213
- If there's dirt, we'll find it.
- What's this?

753
00:47:14.314 --> 00:47:19.053
Mandi's Annual Birthday Bash.
Everybody wants to be invited.

754
00:47:19.154 --> 00:47:20.840
But, of course, they aren't.

755
00:47:20.841 --> 00:47:23.539
Mandi never allows anybody
to throw a party when she does.

756
00:47:23.639 --> 00:47:26.527
Is that so?

757
00:47:33.434 --> 00:47:35.267
I am so excited.

758
00:47:35.368 --> 00:47:38.104
Tonight is gonna
be the perfect night.

759
00:47:38.205 --> 00:47:42.042
It should be.
It's costing my dad enough.

760
00:47:42.143 --> 00:47:44.311
Our dad, Tyler.

761
00:47:44.412 --> 00:47:46.881
You know, most people
would die to be my brother.

762
00:47:46.982 --> 00:47:50.617
That's only because they don't
know what you're really like.

763
00:47:50.719 --> 00:47:53.772
You mean perfect,
awesome and popular?

764
00:47:53.873 --> 00:47:58.476
More like conceited,
vain and vindictive.

765
00:47:58.578 --> 00:48:01.180
You're only happy when
making others miserable.

766
00:48:01.281 --> 00:48:03.080
But high school
will end, Mandi.

767
00:48:03.181 --> 00:48:05.483
And then what
will you have left?

768
00:48:14.211 --> 00:48:17.312
This is a bad idea.
Nobody's gonna show up.

769
00:48:17.413 --> 00:48:20.332
Of course they will. Who wants
to go to some expensive party...

770
00:48:20.434 --> 00:48:22.435
with cocktail dresses
and raw fish,

771
00:48:22.536 --> 00:48:25.571
where Mandi talks
about how awesome she is?

772
00:48:25.672 --> 00:48:27.857
People who think
Mandi's awesome.

773
00:48:28.191 --> 00:48:29.942
No one
actually thinks that.

774
00:48:30.041 --> 00:48:33.112
Trust me, it's just years
of social brainwashing.

775
00:48:33.214 --> 00:48:35.515
Ooh!

776
00:48:35.616 --> 00:48:38.852
Wait, why aren't
you guys ready? Huh?

777
00:48:38.953 --> 00:48:43.558
- People will arrive any minute!
- We are ready.

778
00:48:43.659 --> 00:48:45.291
No! No!

779
00:48:45.392 --> 00:48:47.261
- Abby, no! Honey!
- Mom...

780
00:48:47.362 --> 00:48:49.814
I bought you all those
party clothes for a reason.

781
00:48:49.915 --> 00:48:53.568
Now you don't have an excuse,
because you're actually the host.

782
00:48:53.669 --> 00:48:55.454
Huh? Come on. Come on, come on!
Come on, let's go.

783
00:48:55.555 --> 00:48:57.804
Come on, sugar, let's go!

784
00:48:57.989 --> 00:49:02.659
Come on! My little girl
is throwing a party!

785
00:49:06.033 --> 00:49:07.900
- Seriously?
- Mom, stop.

786
00:49:08.001 --> 00:49:11.503
Now, Jo, you know you're not
gonna have this little body forever.

787
00:49:11.604 --> 00:49:14.339
- Mom! - I'm just saying
she oughta show it off.

788
00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:17.376
- Mom, just stop!
- In something like this.

789
00:49:17.477 --> 00:49:20.146
- Ugh! Ilene Hanover!
- Definitely.

790
00:49:20.247 --> 00:49:23.116
I knew it!

791
00:49:30.890 --> 00:49:33.226
- Invitation, miss?
- I don't have one.

792
00:49:33.327 --> 00:49:35.495
Oh, no, I'm sorry,
it's invite only.

793
00:49:39.266 --> 00:49:40.766
Okay.

794
00:49:45.957 --> 00:49:50.294
Thank you, thank you all so much
for coming to my birth...

795
00:49:53.849 --> 00:49:56.984
Where... Where is everyone?

796
00:50:16.507 --> 00:50:19.473
Wow! I can't believe this!

797
00:50:19.574 --> 00:50:23.294
I can't believe this
is my house, my party!

798
00:50:23.395 --> 00:50:26.031
Believe it.

799
00:50:26.132 --> 00:50:30.886
- You both look amazing. - Thanks,
you're not so bad yourself.

800
00:50:30.988 --> 00:50:35.708
This party rocks!
Only where's the food?

801
00:50:35.809 --> 00:50:39.847
Oh, I heard Mandi's
serving nigiri sushi.

802
00:50:39.948 --> 00:50:43.617
- That's sushi.
- Pizza's coming.

803
00:50:43.719 --> 00:50:46.852
Pizza.

804
00:50:46.953 --> 00:50:49.623
This is a disaster
of epic proportions!

805
00:50:49.724 --> 00:50:52.292
I mean,
don't panic, Mandi.

806
00:50:52.394 --> 00:50:55.795
Maybe they just got
the wrong address.

807
00:50:55.898 --> 00:51:00.369
Or... what if Jo and Abby

808
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:03.870
are throwing a party tonight?

809
00:51:06.175 --> 00:51:09.243
Stating the
obvious much, moron?

810
00:51:09.344 --> 00:51:13.815
- What are we gonna do?
- Not go over there?

811
00:51:17.469 --> 00:51:19.903
He's inside!

812
00:51:39.443 --> 00:51:43.229
Hope, do you still have that
vile medicine from your doctor?

813
00:51:43.330 --> 00:51:47.000
You mean the ipecac?
Of course.

814
00:51:47.335 --> 00:51:50.021
Oh!

815
00:52:00.483 --> 00:52:04.251
Elliot hasn't stopped
staring at you all night.

816
00:52:04.352 --> 00:52:07.004
Really? But he's Elliot.

817
00:52:13.644 --> 00:52:15.328
Thanks.

818
00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:18.267
Oh, thank God,
I'm starving.

819
00:52:18.368 --> 00:52:20.702
Do these smell funny?

820
00:52:20.803 --> 00:52:24.972
Maybe the delivery guy
mixed up our order.

821
00:52:25.073 --> 00:52:28.844
- Here you go. Thanks.
- No problem. Glad to help.

822
00:52:29.946 --> 00:52:32.197
- Wait! Don't eat that.
- What? Why?

823
00:52:32.299 --> 00:52:35.503
Because I'm not the only one
who paid the pizza guy.

824
00:52:39.039 --> 00:52:41.007
OK, it's done.

825
00:52:41.108 --> 00:52:44.511
Their party's about to
get extremely unsanitary.

826
00:52:49.185 --> 00:52:52.018
- What'd I miss?
- Oh, nothing, honey bear.

827
00:52:52.119 --> 00:52:53.919
We just have
a party to attend.

828
00:52:54.021 --> 00:52:56.758
Oh, and I wouldn't wear
nice shoes if I were you.

829
00:52:56.858 --> 00:52:58.591
Perhaps galoshes.

830
00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:13.325
- Happy not your birthday!
- Really, Chastity?

831
00:53:13.426 --> 00:53:14.993
Joke.

832
00:53:19.331 --> 00:53:22.601
Wait, nobody's puking.

833
00:53:22.702 --> 00:53:24.736
Oh, thank God!

834
00:53:24.837 --> 00:53:26.771
I mean, damn it!

835
00:53:26.872 --> 00:53:29.793
Where's the pizza?

836
00:53:29.894 --> 00:53:32.325
What the hell happened?

837
00:53:32.428 --> 00:53:35.263
God, Nick, go do something!

838
00:53:37.634 --> 00:53:42.272
- Look at those two. - God,
what does Tyler even see in her?

839
00:53:42.373 --> 00:53:45.741
Get over it already, Chastity.
My brother is off-limits.

840
00:53:45.842 --> 00:53:47.743
Like what you
say matters, Mandi.

841
00:53:47.844 --> 00:53:49.713
You can't even
throw a birthday party.

842
00:53:49.814 --> 00:53:51.415
Shut up!

843
00:53:54.735 --> 00:53:57.454
I'll be right back.

844
00:53:57.555 --> 00:53:59.020
Man, the food's all gone.

845
00:53:59.121 --> 00:54:03.460
Oh, Nick, I saved you
a piece of pizza. One second.

846
00:54:05.196 --> 00:54:06.830
Why is Mandi here?

847
00:54:06.931 --> 00:54:09.834
Well, I think she was hoping
to gloat over a party disaster,

848
00:54:09.935 --> 00:54:13.703
which, if I can count
on Nick, won't take long.

849
00:54:15.473 --> 00:54:18.076
- Bon appetit.
- Thank you.

850
00:54:21.264 --> 00:54:23.215
Mandi, can I see
your invitation?

851
00:54:23.316 --> 00:54:28.620
Because I'm pretty sure I left
"Vapid Bitch" off the list.

852
00:54:28.721 --> 00:54:31.706
You think you're so clever,
but you're not.

853
00:54:31.807 --> 00:54:33.544
You're just using my brother
to get back at me,

854
00:54:33.545 --> 00:54:34.844
and I'm gonna make sure
that he knows that.

855
00:54:34.845 --> 00:54:39.798
Not everything is about you, Mandi.
Especially not my love life.

856
00:54:41.016 --> 00:54:43.152
At least I have one.

857
00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:45.238
Where's your boyfriend
on your birthday?

858
00:54:45.339 --> 00:54:49.427
You wanna see
a love life, little virgin?

859
00:54:49.528 --> 00:54:51.194
I'll show you.

860
00:55:12.617 --> 00:55:14.518
Oh, my God,
did he just...?

861
00:55:14.620 --> 00:55:17.756
Oh! Oh God,
move! Move!

862
00:55:17.857 --> 00:55:20.292
Yep. Sorry
about your patio.

863
00:55:20.393 --> 00:55:22.461
Oh, totally worth it!

864
00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:26.948
And we didn't
just stop there.

865
00:55:27.049 --> 00:55:29.752
Abby, Quinn and I set out
to disband the Plastics...

866
00:55:29.854 --> 00:55:31.087
once and for all.

867
00:55:31.188 --> 00:55:33.974
We called ourselves
the Anti-Plastics.

868
00:55:34.075 --> 00:55:38.845
Not very original,
but it got the point across.

869
00:55:39.146 --> 00:55:40.664
Wow.

870
00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:42.698
Wow.

871
00:55:44.601 --> 00:55:46.170
Wow.

872
00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:51.701
We gathered our forces.

873
00:55:52.442 --> 00:55:53.943
But as the Anti-Plastics grew,

874
00:55:54.045 --> 00:55:57.364
Mandi started recruiting
for her side.

875
00:56:08.426 --> 00:56:12.163
It was time to break
apart the founding members,

876
00:56:12.264 --> 00:56:13.464
starting with Chastity.

877
00:56:14.851 --> 00:56:16.582
So we simply
tipped Principal Duvall.

878
00:56:16.685 --> 00:56:19.721
Oh! Oh, Principal Duvall!
A note.

879
00:56:19.822 --> 00:56:22.157
Her weakness:
a raging libido.

880
00:56:22.358 --> 00:56:24.286
OK, where's
the back stairwell

881
00:56:24.288 --> 00:56:26.563
that's a herpes infection
waiting to happen?

882
00:56:26.664 --> 00:56:28.732
- C-wing.
- Thank you.

883
00:56:38.407 --> 00:56:40.309
Elliot, let me borrow that.

884
00:56:42.962 --> 00:56:45.330
The camera! Get to class.

885
00:56:45.431 --> 00:56:49.066
For the love of all that's sanitary,
get outta there, people!

886
00:56:55.342 --> 00:56:57.275
You wait right here,
young lady.

887
00:56:57.376 --> 00:57:01.448
You officially earned detention
for a week. Unbelievable.

888
00:57:01.549 --> 00:57:05.052
No, no, no! In solitary confinement.
Let's go, move it.

889
00:57:05.153 --> 00:57:06.354
- Principal Duvall.
- What?

890
00:57:06.455 --> 00:57:09.290
- The announcements!
- Oh, yeah, let's go!

891
00:57:14.062 --> 00:57:16.531
- And action!
- Good afternoon, everybody.

892
00:57:16.632 --> 00:57:20.301
We have a winner for the
Homecoming Dance Charity.

893
00:57:20.402 --> 00:57:23.971
The winner
is the Humane Society.

894
00:57:24.072 --> 00:57:27.525
So... Where did
you come from?

895
00:57:27.576 --> 00:57:28.710
Get outta here!

896
00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:31.230
I'm talking about the importance
of neutering here, people!

897
00:57:31.330 --> 00:57:32.463
Cut it off.

898
00:57:35.018 --> 00:57:37.186
- How could you do that?
- Do what?

899
00:57:37.287 --> 00:57:42.073
Rat out all of my make-out spots!
You're the only one I told, Mandi.

900
00:57:42.174 --> 00:57:45.544
Now, who's gonna do my homework
and tell me I'm special?

901
00:57:49.785 --> 00:57:51.315
- Sorry.
- Hey!

902
00:57:51.416 --> 00:57:53.551
For Hope,
who'd been a hypochondriac

903
00:57:53.652 --> 00:57:55.989
since contracting mono
from a water fountain,

904
00:57:56.090 --> 00:57:59.392
we said goodbye to Mandi's
"no bodily fluids" rule.

905
00:57:59.494 --> 00:58:03.163
Ew! Oh, my God, oh, my God!

906
00:58:03.264 --> 00:58:07.300
- I'm gonna contract E. coli.
- Even worse, you have a zit.

907
00:58:08.169 --> 00:58:10.605
I knew ugliness was contagious!

908
00:58:10.706 --> 00:58:14.041
Hope booked an emergency
healing massage and seaweed facial.

909
00:58:23.569 --> 00:58:27.037
Unfortunately, there
was a mix-up at the spa,

910
00:58:27.138 --> 00:58:29.975
and Hope ended up resembling
the Wicked Witch of the West.

911
00:58:30.076 --> 00:58:33.978
It still hadn't faded
after an entire weekend.

912
00:58:36.481 --> 00:58:39.952
Mandi! What is wrong with you?

913
00:58:40.053 --> 00:58:43.122
You didn't pick me up.
I had to ride my Schwinn.

914
00:58:43.223 --> 00:58:45.159
I don't pick up ogres.

915
00:58:45.260 --> 00:58:48.192
And green, definitely
not your color.

916
00:58:48.293 --> 00:58:49.760
Wha...?

917
00:58:52.048 --> 00:58:53.750
Why hasn't it washed away?

918
00:58:53.851 --> 00:58:56.286
I added some
long-lasting henna ink.

919
00:58:56.388 --> 00:58:58.422
Don't you think
that's a bit much?

920
00:58:58.523 --> 00:59:01.657
Come on,
she deserved it.

921
00:59:21.579 --> 00:59:23.881
Peace out!

922
00:59:27.251 --> 00:59:28.985
Nobody'll ever see that.

923
00:59:29.221 --> 00:59:31.405
With Chastity
and Hope down,

924
00:59:31.507 --> 00:59:33.641
there was only
one Plastic left.

925
00:59:33.742 --> 00:59:37.378
Cupcakes! Cupcakes!

926
00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:39.148
Red velvet,
or perhaps devil's food cake?

927
00:59:39.249 --> 00:59:40.865
- Thank you!
- Traitor!

928
00:59:41.050 --> 00:59:44.218
- You don't own me, Mandi.
- Oh, yeah?

929
00:59:44.319 --> 00:59:46.504
Oh!

930
00:59:46.605 --> 00:59:49.308
I don't like you right now!

931
00:59:49.409 --> 00:59:51.978
You totally lost my vote.

932
00:59:54.413 --> 00:59:56.415
Yummy frosting, though.

933
00:59:58.384 --> 00:59:59.334
Nice job, Quinn.

934
00:59:59.435 --> 01:00:01.872
You truly are an amazing
investigative reporter.

935
01:00:01.973 --> 01:00:05.610
I've been obsess... I mean,
watching them for years.

936
01:00:05.711 --> 01:00:08.243
Just needed to dig
a little deeper.

937
01:00:10.714 --> 01:00:12.367
Hi!

938
01:00:12.468 --> 01:00:14.402
Hey.

939
01:00:14.503 --> 01:00:17.738
- Hey!
- Hey!

940
01:00:17.839 --> 01:00:19.607
- Hi.
- Hey!

941
01:00:19.708 --> 01:00:22.658
- Hello, girls.
- Hey!

942
01:00:22.759 --> 01:00:24.961
- I already got my dress.
- Hey.

943
01:00:25.062 --> 01:00:26.148
Oh, hey, Abby.

944
01:00:26.149 --> 01:00:28.549
Okay, Jo, this year the music
better not suck at the dance.

945
01:00:28.550 --> 01:00:30.351
- You've sway with the DJ, right?
- Of course.

946
01:00:30.352 --> 01:00:32.520
- What are your requests?
- Okay...

947
01:00:32.621 --> 01:00:35.422
- We could get that guy who...
- You know, if she keeps...

948
01:00:35.524 --> 01:00:38.559
inviting everybody
to join our group,

949
01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:40.461
there won't be any room left.

950
01:00:40.562 --> 01:00:44.165
At least Mandi understood
the importance of exclusivity.

951
01:00:44.266 --> 01:00:47.204
Someone has to be
the proletariat.

952
01:00:47.305 --> 01:00:49.637
That's lower class.

953
01:00:56.563 --> 01:00:58.731
Hey, kid.
Lend me a hand, huh?

954
01:00:58.832 --> 01:01:01.386
Jimmy gave me an extension
on delivering the engine.

955
01:01:01.487 --> 01:01:03.035
Um, sorry, Dad.

956
01:01:03.136 --> 01:01:05.570
I've got shopping with Quinn
and a movie with Tyler,

957
01:01:05.671 --> 01:01:08.642
and I still have
to make my campaign buttons.

958
01:01:08.743 --> 01:01:10.843
Busy, busy!

959
01:01:14.632 --> 01:01:16.698
Busy, busy.

960
01:01:18.419 --> 01:01:19.819
- Hey, Jo.
- Hi.

961
01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:21.404
- Hey!
- Hi.

962
01:01:21.505 --> 01:01:23.089
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.

963
01:01:23.441 --> 01:01:26.159
- What's up?
- Hi.

964
01:01:28.362 --> 01:01:29.931
I wonder how much
sugar is in this.

965
01:01:30.030 --> 01:01:33.100
- You did not just ask that.
- What?

966
01:01:33.201 --> 01:01:36.238
Jo, you ate, like,
two funnel cakes, a hot dog...

967
01:01:36.339 --> 01:01:38.689
and a bag of kettle corn
on our first date.

968
01:01:38.790 --> 01:01:42.778
And you didn't wear
these crazy studded boots.

969
01:01:49.302 --> 01:01:51.437
Come on.
You're kidding me, right?

970
01:01:51.538 --> 01:01:54.273
- Using me to make Chastity jealous?
- Look, I was just...

971
01:01:54.374 --> 01:01:56.994
Starting to act a hell
of a lot like Mandi,

972
01:01:57.095 --> 01:01:59.444
which is not the kind of
girl I want to be dating.

973
01:01:59.545 --> 01:02:02.648
Hey, I am nothing like Mandi.

974
01:02:02.749 --> 01:02:07.220
Oh, really? Running
for queen, humiliating people,

975
01:02:07.321 --> 01:02:08.905
using their secrets
against them,

976
01:02:09.015 --> 01:02:10.624
dressing like you're on
the cover of Rolling Stone,

977
01:02:10.957 --> 01:02:13.826
which, OK, it's kinda hot
sometimes, but not the part...

978
01:02:13.928 --> 01:02:17.312
where you suddenly care about
what everyone else thinks.

979
01:02:18.850 --> 01:02:21.102
Jo...

980
01:02:21.203 --> 01:02:24.439
What happened to that girl
I met in shop class?

981
01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:46.695
And when I got home,
there it was,

982
01:02:46.797 --> 01:02:49.665
waiting for me:
my future.

983
01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:52.301
How had I almost forgotten?

984
01:02:59.241 --> 01:03:01.477
The fat letter!

985
01:03:01.578 --> 01:03:05.031
- It's good news, right?
- The best.

986
01:03:06.465 --> 01:03:08.850
Ah, Jo. Look, honey,

987
01:03:08.951 --> 01:03:12.571
I feel lousy
about your tuition fund.

988
01:03:12.673 --> 01:03:14.841
But, honey, that doesn't mean
that you shouldn't be excited.

989
01:03:14.942 --> 01:03:17.995
I mean, CMU, that's...
that's big stuff!

990
01:03:18.096 --> 01:03:20.028
And if I can just get
this engine finished,

991
01:03:20.129 --> 01:03:23.282
or... what about that
architectural scholarship?

992
01:03:23.383 --> 01:03:24.836
The scholarship.

993
01:03:24.937 --> 01:03:26.704
But somehow,
all this campaigning...

994
01:03:26.805 --> 01:03:30.307
and preening and plotting
had gotten in the way.

995
01:03:30.408 --> 01:03:34.077
I didn't even know what my grade was
in shop class anymore.

996
01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:38.499
Oh, hey, I almost forgot. Um...

997
01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:41.954
Abby's dad dropped
this off for ya.

998
01:03:42.055 --> 01:03:43.805
So does she know where
she's goin' to college yet?

999
01:03:43.906 --> 01:03:48.125
Um, Abby wants art school, but
her dad's more of a pre-med guy.

1000
01:03:48.226 --> 01:03:52.364
Well, just make sure that she knows
that to, um, to win the race...

1001
01:03:52.465 --> 01:03:54.782
You gotta be in the race.

1002
01:04:06.546 --> 01:04:08.948
But what if I wanted out?

1003
01:04:09.050 --> 01:04:10.583
What if I wanted
to forfeit the race...

1004
01:04:10.684 --> 01:04:14.287
because I didn't
deserve to win?

1005
01:04:14.388 --> 01:04:17.138
Got something
that's real revolutionary.

1006
01:04:17.239 --> 01:04:21.111
It's gonna revolutionize
your gardening experience.

1007
01:04:21.879 --> 01:04:24.382
Hey, Mr. Hanover.

1008
01:04:24.483 --> 01:04:26.016
Abby's not home
from the movie yet, is she?

1009
01:04:26.284 --> 01:04:28.985
No,
thought you'd be with 'em.

1010
01:04:29.086 --> 01:04:34.793
- But glad you're here.
- Listen, Mr. Hanover, I...

1011
01:04:34.894 --> 01:04:39.297
- I brought back the money.
- Jo, what, are you crazy?

1012
01:04:39.398 --> 01:04:42.449
The money's for you,
every damn penny. You've earned it.

1013
01:04:42.550 --> 01:04:46.639
Hiring you to be her friend was
the best money we've ever spent.

1014
01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:50.524
Please, Mr. Hanover,
I can't.

1015
01:04:52.028 --> 01:04:53.929
Jo, I'm sending it
right back to you.

1016
01:04:54.030 --> 01:04:56.180
I'd give a bonus,
if I gave them.

1017
01:04:56.281 --> 01:04:57.799
Which I don't.

1018
01:05:10.929 --> 01:05:14.867
Is it true? Did my dad pay
you to be friends with me?

1019
01:05:16.053 --> 01:05:18.305
Quinn finally
got her big story.

1020
01:05:18.406 --> 01:05:20.774
She quoted Mandi
as a witness.

1021
01:05:20.875 --> 01:05:22.459
Why would Quinn do this?

1022
01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:25.562
How could you?

1023
01:05:25.663 --> 01:05:28.999
- I was gonna tell Abby everything.
- Face it, Jo.

1024
01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:30.884
The Plastics
are the originals,

1025
01:05:30.985 --> 01:05:33.437
and they don't have to pay
anyone to be their friend.

1026
01:05:33.538 --> 01:05:36.108
No! You just sold out
your friends for free!

1027
01:05:36.209 --> 01:05:38.108
Oh, what,
like you sold me out?

1028
01:05:38.209 --> 01:05:40.511
God, I trusted you.

1029
01:05:40.612 --> 01:05:43.047
You know what?
You go to hell, Jo Mitchell.

1030
01:05:43.149 --> 01:05:45.215
I wish I never
even met you.

1031
01:06:28.446 --> 01:06:30.198
Just
to see their faces.

1032
01:06:30.299 --> 01:06:33.333
You were so good, Mandi.
I totally voted for you.

1033
01:06:33.434 --> 01:06:36.254
- It's too bad this didn't
come out earlier. - Why?

1034
01:06:36.554 --> 01:06:39.891
Well, from what I hear, Jo is
a shoo-in for Homecoming Queen.

1035
01:06:39.992 --> 01:06:42.093
It's too late for people
to change their votes.

1036
01:06:42.294 --> 01:06:43.790
That is,
if she's eligible.

1037
01:06:43.895 --> 01:06:47.899
Eligibility is based
on matriculation.

1038
01:06:47.999 --> 01:06:53.221
- So she'd have to be expelled
or something. - Oh.

1039
01:06:54.891 --> 01:06:57.060
Wouldn't that be a tragedy?

1040
01:07:13.342 --> 01:07:16.377
This is gonna be
the best senior prank ever.

1041
01:07:16.478 --> 01:07:17.929
The best.

1042
01:07:20.101 --> 01:07:23.437
OK, so tell me again
why we don't keep the money?

1043
01:07:23.537 --> 01:07:26.338
- That's a lot of money.
- Then there's no dance,

1044
01:07:26.439 --> 01:07:29.309
and if there's no dance,
I'm not the queen.

1045
01:07:30.095 --> 01:07:32.828
I don't know.

1046
01:07:32.929 --> 01:07:35.483
Money can't do this.

1047
01:07:46.445 --> 01:07:49.029
As many of you know,
we had a robbery last night.

1048
01:07:49.130 --> 01:07:53.516
Now, the evidence strongly
suggests that the thief

1049
01:07:53.618 --> 01:07:56.600
was a student, because
of his wanton disregard

1050
01:07:56.618 --> 01:07:57.840
for school property.

1051
01:07:57.940 --> 01:08:01.742
This student, or students,
clearly degenerates,

1052
01:08:01.843 --> 01:08:06.015
stole the money that was
intended for helpless animals.

1053
01:08:06.116 --> 01:08:07.798
Now, unless
the money is returned,

1054
01:08:07.899 --> 01:08:12.703
I have no choice but
to cancel the Homecoming Dance.

1055
01:08:12.804 --> 01:08:16.760
This is your principal,

1056
01:08:16.861 --> 01:08:18.178
signing off for today,

1057
01:08:18.279 --> 01:08:22.514
reminding you to stay left
or right, not center.

1058
01:08:27.354 --> 01:08:30.225
Miss Mitchell, I received
an anonymous tip today

1059
01:08:30.230 --> 01:08:32.660
that you stole
the money.

1060
01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:36.195
That's a lie.
I would never do that.

1061
01:08:36.296 --> 01:08:37.779
Well, apparently you did.

1062
01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:40.817
We had a policeman go
to your shed this afternoon.

1063
01:08:42.388 --> 01:08:45.088
And I'm afraid we
found the stolen money.

1064
01:08:45.190 --> 01:08:48.125
- How did that get there?
- I didn't steal it, I swear!

1065
01:08:48.226 --> 01:08:50.477
Somebody must've
put it there, and...

1066
01:08:50.578 --> 01:08:52.496
I would bet anything
it was Mandi.

1067
01:08:52.798 --> 01:08:55.934
Well, now, Miss Weatherly
may be the spawn of Satan,

1068
01:08:56.035 --> 01:08:57.503
but unless you have proof,

1069
01:08:57.604 --> 01:08:59.638
there's nothing I can do
except expel you.

1070
01:08:59.739 --> 01:09:02.991
It officially
couldn't get much worse.

1071
01:09:03.092 --> 01:09:04.135
I'm also sorry to say

1072
01:09:04.145 --> 01:09:06.629
that I'm gonna have to
report this to Carnegie Mellon,

1073
01:09:06.829 --> 01:09:10.750
and they very well may
rescind your admission.

1074
01:09:11.752 --> 01:09:14.504
Miss Mitchell, where are
you going? Come back here!

1075
01:09:14.605 --> 01:09:16.305
- Did you hear about Jo?
- I can't believe it.

1076
01:09:16.406 --> 01:09:18.073
- What a fake.
- I knew it.

1077
01:09:18.174 --> 01:09:21.594
I knew it all along,
and I tried to warn people.

1078
01:09:21.661 --> 01:09:24.329
I tried to protect
you all from her.

1079
01:09:24.430 --> 01:09:27.300
- Mandi, you are like a saint.
- Yeah, a total saint.

1080
01:09:27.401 --> 01:09:30.969
- Oh, yeah, a real martyr.
- You mean a real bitch!

1081
01:09:31.070 --> 01:09:35.040
Wait. As much as we all might
like that, I can't let it happen.

1082
01:09:35.141 --> 01:09:38.345
This is crazy! Shouldn't she be
locked up in juvie or something?

1083
01:09:38.647 --> 01:09:40.464
Girls, why don't we
settle this like ladies...

1084
01:09:40.565 --> 01:09:42.233
Screw being ladies,
and screw being girls!

1085
01:09:42.334 --> 01:09:46.018
I'm sick of the mind games and
the backstabbing and the set-ups.

1086
01:09:46.119 --> 01:09:50.423
I know you framed me, Mandi.

1087
01:09:50.525 --> 01:09:53.878
So we're gonna settle this
like men, on the battlefield.

1088
01:09:53.979 --> 01:09:56.181
- Oh, please.
- That's right.

1089
01:09:56.282 --> 01:09:57.663
I challenge you...

1090
01:10:02.755 --> 01:10:04.856
...to a football game,

1091
01:10:04.957 --> 01:10:07.860
- Powder Puff style.
- No way.

1092
01:10:07.961 --> 01:10:10.361
I... I don't do sports.

1093
01:10:10.462 --> 01:10:12.881
Aw, you scared?

1094
01:10:12.982 --> 01:10:16.185
Can't take the heat, Mandi?

1095
01:10:16.286 --> 01:10:18.720
I thought you were
the best at everything.

1096
01:10:18.821 --> 01:10:23.594
I thought people trembled in
the presence of the Plastics.

1097
01:10:23.693 --> 01:10:25.377
You wanna win?

1098
01:10:25.562 --> 01:10:30.917
The only way you're gonna
become queen is by default.

1099
01:10:35.757 --> 01:10:38.223
Fine, you're on.

1100
01:10:38.323 --> 01:10:40.592
But be prepared to lose.

1101
01:10:40.693 --> 01:10:43.797
You know, you
and your team of one.

1102
01:10:51.555 --> 01:10:56.027
I realized a little too late
that I no longer had any friends.

1103
01:10:56.128 --> 01:11:01.315
But if I had to take on
all the Plastics by myself, I would.

1104
01:11:08.657 --> 01:11:10.620
All right, let's get
to class, everybody.

1105
01:11:10.838 --> 01:11:12.194
Hang out
in the hallway.

1106
01:11:12.294 --> 01:11:15.597
- Do you really think she did it?
- I don't know anymore.

1107
01:11:15.698 --> 01:11:17.633
Certainly not about Jo.

1108
01:11:29.130 --> 01:11:33.999
Hey, Mr. Hanover, this was
in our mailbox. It's for you.

1109
01:11:34.099 --> 01:11:37.537
- Listen, you're Jo's boyfriend,
right? - Ex-boyfriend.

1110
01:11:37.638 --> 01:11:41.023
Huh, awkward.

1111
01:11:41.124 --> 01:11:43.444
Thing is, I've got something for Jo.
It's the money, actually.

1112
01:11:43.545 --> 01:11:45.250
Would you give it to her?
A deal's a deal.

1113
01:11:45.365 --> 01:11:47.281
It's not her fault
Abby found out.

1114
01:11:49.383 --> 01:11:52.954
- She gave the money back
to you? - Of course.

1115
01:11:53.055 --> 01:11:54.823
I was expecting it, really.

1116
01:11:54.924 --> 01:11:57.091
I knew she'd love Abby
once she got to know her.

1117
01:11:57.191 --> 01:11:58.526
I just needed
to make that happen.

1118
01:11:58.694 --> 01:12:00.795
So remember, you can't wear
red or pink to the dance.

1119
01:12:00.896 --> 01:12:02.596
Those are my colors.
And I'm wearing my hair up,

1120
01:12:02.697 --> 01:12:05.434
'cause it's best for the crown,
so wear yours down.

1121
01:12:05.535 --> 01:12:09.838
- Quinn, are you listening?
- Yes, absolutely. Hair down.

1122
01:12:14.058 --> 01:12:16.745
Hey, Abby.

1123
01:12:19.048 --> 01:12:21.482
- Look, just don't.
- But...

1124
01:12:21.583 --> 01:12:24.070
You know, Jo may
have lied to me,

1125
01:12:24.171 --> 01:12:25.873
but at least she
taught me one thing.

1126
01:12:25.974 --> 01:12:30.342
Stand up for myself.
So... get lost, Quinn.

1127
01:12:30.441 --> 01:12:33.329
Fine, hate me.

1128
01:12:33.430 --> 01:12:37.367
But you should know I don't
think Jo stole the money.

1129
01:12:37.468 --> 01:12:39.837
I think Mandi did.

1130
01:12:39.938 --> 01:12:43.439
- How do you know?
- Because I sort of gave her...

1131
01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:46.342
the idea to get Jo expelled.

1132
01:12:48.163 --> 01:12:52.550
Also, Jo spent an awful lot
of time putting together...

1133
01:12:52.651 --> 01:12:56.486
and sending out college
applications for you.

1134
01:12:56.587 --> 01:12:59.757
She even put together
your portfolio.

1135
01:13:02.677 --> 01:13:07.248
I helped her make about a dozen
of those with journalism equipment.

1136
01:13:08.849 --> 01:13:12.303
I hope you get
into art school, Abby.

1137
01:13:12.404 --> 01:13:14.172
I really do.

1138
01:13:32.660 --> 01:13:35.426
So Mr. Hanover just called.

1139
01:13:35.527 --> 01:13:39.115
Apparently, one of his distributors
is sending new parts for the engine.

1140
01:13:40.650 --> 01:13:42.619
That's great, right?

1141
01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:46.858
We can finish the car in time
for Jimmy and the new racer.

1142
01:13:46.959 --> 01:13:50.058
So, you, uh...
You heard from Abby?

1143
01:13:51.794 --> 01:13:54.098
I've texted, called.

1144
01:13:54.199 --> 01:13:57.534
I tried her
NorthShoreCentric page.

1145
01:13:57.635 --> 01:14:03.139
No luck. That girl
really hates my guts.

1146
01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:07.277
But I can't blame her.
I'm not sure why you don't hate me.

1147
01:14:07.378 --> 01:14:12.717
Listen, kid, I'm not proud
of what you did to Abby,

1148
01:14:12.818 --> 01:14:15.687
but I know
that you care about her.

1149
01:14:15.788 --> 01:14:20.441
- And you're certainly not a thief.
- At least someone believes me.

1150
01:14:23.912 --> 01:14:26.482
Oh, I don't
think it's just me.

1151
01:14:33.824 --> 01:14:37.042
- Am I seeing things?
- We haven't forgiven you yet.

1152
01:14:37.143 --> 01:14:38.745
Not even close.

1153
01:14:41.983 --> 01:14:44.466
But we can't let you
take the fall for Mandi.

1154
01:14:44.567 --> 01:14:47.803
- That's right, we've got your back.
- Mandi's goin' down.

1155
01:14:47.905 --> 01:14:49.924
I knew it.

1156
01:14:50.025 --> 01:14:52.574
I knew Mandi set me up, and...

1157
01:14:53.444 --> 01:14:55.730
you guys came to rescue me.

1158
01:14:57.413 --> 01:14:59.399
I don't deserve you.

1159
01:15:00.434 --> 01:15:02.268
Oh, my God, are you crying?

1160
01:15:02.369 --> 01:15:06.441
No, I never cry.

1161
01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:11.194
All right, now come on,
we have a game to prepare for.

1162
01:15:11.295 --> 01:15:14.164
And you're right,
Mandi needs her ass kicked.

1163
01:15:14.265 --> 01:15:16.468
And we have an idea
to prove your innocence.

1164
01:15:38.909 --> 01:15:42.243
- Do you think you can do it?
- Hack into their security system?

1165
01:15:42.244 --> 01:15:43.730
Not easy,
but not impossible.

1166
01:15:43.835 --> 01:15:45.949
I just have to detect
their wireless signal,

1167
01:15:46.049 --> 01:15:48.719
then hack into their computer
and find their security account.

1168
01:15:48.820 --> 01:15:50.954
Uh, wait, got it.

1169
01:15:51.188 --> 01:15:53.739
They named their Wi-Fi
"AlwaysWatching"?

1170
01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:55.941
What's their
pass code, "666"?

1171
01:15:56.042 --> 01:15:59.580
It'll take a few days, but if
Mandi planted the evidence,

1172
01:15:59.681 --> 01:16:01.316
I'll find the footage.

1173
01:16:01.417 --> 01:16:05.587
But... I want
something in return.

1174
01:16:05.688 --> 01:16:07.553
I knew it. I knew
he wouldn't do it for free.

1175
01:16:07.721 --> 01:16:09.924
What do you
want, Elliot?

1176
01:16:10.025 --> 01:16:13.928
A date to the dance,
with Abby.

1177
01:16:18.018 --> 01:16:21.536
Oh, um, hey, good luck at the game.
I'll be rooting for you.

1178
01:16:21.636 --> 01:16:23.971
Uh, even got my
own side biz going on.

1179
01:16:24.073 --> 01:16:26.709
Odds are 30 to one
in Mandi's favor.

1180
01:16:26.810 --> 01:16:30.145
- What? Why?
- You haven't heard?

1181
01:16:30.246 --> 01:16:34.850
Mandi had managed to recruit
the captain of the rugby team...

1182
01:16:36.252 --> 01:16:39.021
a fifth-year senior
who felt no pain...

1183
01:16:40.556 --> 01:16:45.227
and the three-time Junior Division
Karate Champion onto her team.

1184
01:16:46.329 --> 01:16:48.930
But we weren't backing down.

1185
01:16:49.949 --> 01:16:51.266
And neither was Mandi.

1186
01:16:51.367 --> 01:16:53.970
She wasn't going
to pull any punches.

1187
01:16:54.155 --> 01:16:57.324
It was time to end this
once and for all.

1188
01:17:04.581 --> 01:17:06.450
- Got it?
- Yes, sir!

1189
01:17:06.551 --> 01:17:08.452
Good!

1190
01:17:08.553 --> 01:17:11.589
Hi, baby!
Oh, you look so cute.

1191
01:17:11.690 --> 01:17:12.959
Our little athlete.

1192
01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:15.758
Mom, Dad, come on. You know
you can't be in here. Just go.

1193
01:17:15.759 --> 01:17:18.178
You're right, you're right.
We need to find a seat.

1194
01:17:18.279 --> 01:17:21.817
- The bleachers are already
filling up. - Yay! Yay!

1195
01:17:25.154 --> 01:17:28.973
- I'm gonna vomit.
- It's gonna be OK, I promise.

1196
01:17:29.074 --> 01:17:31.976
- What's the worst that
could happen? - We lose?

1197
01:17:32.078 --> 01:17:35.362
Is everybody decent in here?

1198
01:17:35.463 --> 01:17:38.350
I don't want a sexual
harassment lawsuit... again.

1199
01:17:38.602 --> 01:17:39.869
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we're good.

1200
01:17:39.970 --> 01:17:42.169
Principal Duvall, what are you
doing here on a weekend?

1201
01:17:42.270 --> 01:17:45.373
Well, I've tried to turn
a blind eye to this game,

1202
01:17:45.474 --> 01:17:48.226
but the fact that you made
the challenge in my presence,

1203
01:17:48.327 --> 01:17:52.865
and you've plastered the school
with posters made that kinda hard.

1204
01:17:52.966 --> 01:17:54.919
Thought you guys would wimp out.

1205
01:17:55.020 --> 01:17:58.070
But I guess now
I will have to intervene.

1206
01:17:58.171 --> 01:18:01.640
Mainly because Mandi's team
wants to file a lawsuit.

1207
01:18:01.741 --> 01:18:04.861
- What are you talking about?
- Jo, due to your expulsion,

1208
01:18:04.963 --> 01:18:07.215
you are not allowed
on school grounds.

1209
01:18:07.316 --> 01:18:09.114
Thus, you cannot play the game.

1210
01:18:09.215 --> 01:18:13.637
- Damn it! Mandi was counting
on this. - I know.

1211
01:18:13.838 --> 01:18:14.740
You know?

1212
01:18:14.741 --> 01:18:17.541
Yep, which is why I looked
into this issue days ago.

1213
01:18:17.542 --> 01:18:19.111
You know, technically,

1214
01:18:19.212 --> 01:18:22.013
the football field is public
property since it's on park land.

1215
01:18:22.115 --> 01:18:24.715
You know, the school
only rents it for games.

1216
01:18:24.815 --> 01:18:28.920
So all we needed was a permit,
which I have right here.

1217
01:18:29.021 --> 01:18:31.805
Oh! Well, great then.

1218
01:18:31.906 --> 01:18:35.777
I guess you are just not
allowed in the locker room.

1219
01:18:35.878 --> 01:18:40.031
Oh. See ya!

1220
01:18:40.132 --> 01:18:42.584
Well, I guess my
job here is done.

1221
01:18:42.685 --> 01:18:44.837
Ha-ha! Let's go, team!

1222
01:18:44.938 --> 01:18:47.639
Kill! Maim! Dismember.

1223
01:18:55.498 --> 01:18:57.400
Whoo! Yeah!

1224
01:18:59.655 --> 01:19:02.690
Yeah! Whoo!

1225
01:19:02.791 --> 01:19:05.174
Go, Abby!

1226
01:19:07.060 --> 01:19:08.578
The big day was upon us,

1227
01:19:08.679 --> 01:19:11.815
and we were going
to take the Plastics down.

1228
01:19:14.436 --> 01:19:15.838
Come on, girls!

1229
01:19:15.939 --> 01:19:19.589
We were ready
for anything.

1230
01:19:25.780 --> 01:19:27.815
Didn't expect to see me here?

1231
01:19:27.916 --> 01:19:30.468
I'm still gonna
kick your team's ass.

1232
01:19:30.569 --> 01:19:31.868
OK, girls, listen up.

1233
01:19:32.103 --> 01:19:35.856
Football is a religion,
and you are now in church.

1234
01:19:35.957 --> 01:19:39.144
Do not disgrace this field.
We'll play by playground rules.

1235
01:19:39.245 --> 01:19:43.515
Fumbles that hit the ground
are live balls. Four downs and out.

1236
01:19:43.617 --> 01:19:47.619
No punts, no extra points
and a touchdown is seven points.

1237
01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:52.424
Get it? Got it? Good!

1238
01:19:52.525 --> 01:19:55.028
We will flip a coin to see
who receives the ball.

1239
01:19:55.130 --> 01:19:57.331
- Pink Team, you call it.
- Heads.

1240
01:19:58.882 --> 01:20:01.733
- Heads it is.
- We'll receive.

1241
01:20:01.835 --> 01:20:04.471
All right, shake hands.

1242
01:20:06.441 --> 01:20:08.576
OK, then.

1243
01:20:09.227 --> 01:20:11.080
Ow!

1244
01:20:22.758 --> 01:20:25.008
Run, moron, run!

1245
01:20:28.747 --> 01:20:33.618
Take it, take it.

1246
01:20:50.837 --> 01:20:54.139
- There's no nunchakus in football!
- Man.

1247
01:20:59.313 --> 01:21:00.864
Ball, now!

1248
01:21:16.013 --> 01:21:17.464
Touchdown!

1249
01:21:17.565 --> 01:21:19.683
Yay!

1250
01:22:02.862 --> 01:22:05.932
So listen. My dad always
says to win the race,

1251
01:22:06.033 --> 01:22:07.366
you've got to be in the race.

1252
01:22:07.468 --> 01:22:09.902
So think of the worst thing
the Plastics have done to you,

1253
01:22:10.002 --> 01:22:12.105
and knock them down.

1254
01:22:12.206 --> 01:22:14.809
If they're gonna play
full contact, so are we.

1255
01:22:14.910 --> 01:22:17.443
Fumble-rooski on two.

1256
01:22:17.544 --> 01:22:20.112
- Break!
- Break.

1257
01:22:20.213 --> 01:22:21.731
Yeah!

1258
01:22:25.837 --> 01:22:28.557
- Yay!
- Yeah, Jo!

1259
01:22:29.639 --> 01:22:31.341
Good job, honey!

1260
01:22:32.810 --> 01:22:36.815
What... What's goin' on?
What... What are you doing?

1261
01:22:36.916 --> 01:22:38.617
Yes!

1262
01:22:38.719 --> 01:22:40.869
Touchdown!

1263
01:22:43.404 --> 01:22:46.024
That's not fair!
She can't do that. Can she do that?

1264
01:22:48.911 --> 01:22:52.114
- You girls can really play.
Who knew? - Thank you.

1265
01:22:54.117 --> 01:22:56.618
Damn it, we're tied.

1266
01:22:56.719 --> 01:22:58.735
I swear, if you let
that psycho Jo near me,

1267
01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:00.459
I will end
your social lives.

1268
01:23:01.059 --> 01:23:04.760
- Time for D and D.
- Ooh, dirty dancing?

1269
01:23:04.861 --> 01:23:07.396
Yeah, Chastity, dirty dancing.

1270
01:23:07.497 --> 01:23:11.266
No! Down and dirty, OK?
Down and dirty.

1271
01:23:11.367 --> 01:23:13.101
Let's get 'em. Go!

1272
01:23:13.202 --> 01:23:16.004
OK, they were big,
they were bad.

1273
01:23:17.275 --> 01:23:19.893
We were dead.

1274
01:23:22.864 --> 01:23:25.848
I can't see. I can't see!

1275
01:23:25.949 --> 01:23:29.153
- Nothing? How bad's your vision?
- I'm legally blind!

1276
01:23:29.254 --> 01:23:31.221
Number one!

1277
01:23:34.093 --> 01:23:36.727
Just freshening up.

1278
01:23:36.828 --> 01:23:39.914
Smells like lavender
and ocean breeze, doesn't it?

1279
01:23:41.133 --> 01:23:43.652
- Oh, come on!
- Come on, girls.

1280
01:23:43.753 --> 01:23:46.004
Enough of this,
let's play football!

1281
01:23:46.105 --> 01:23:48.490
All right.
My muscles are mush,

1282
01:23:48.592 --> 01:23:50.794
my lungs are about to burst
and just look at us.

1283
01:23:50.895 --> 01:23:53.527
I agree, we're totally
not gonna lose.

1284
01:23:53.629 --> 01:23:55.430
- Gesundheit.
- Cover your mouth.

1285
01:23:55.531 --> 01:23:58.633
- Really? 'Cause they have the ball.
- We have to take a stand.

1286
01:23:58.734 --> 01:24:00.736
We can't let them score.

1287
01:24:00.837 --> 01:24:03.371
- Gesundheit.
- Dude, cover your mouth!

1288
01:24:03.473 --> 01:24:06.441
- OK, I got it.
- Jo! I did it!

1289
01:24:06.542 --> 01:24:08.644
- Look, he did it!
- He did what?

1290
01:24:08.745 --> 01:24:11.295
Yeah. Yeah.

1291
01:24:11.396 --> 01:24:12.599
Is that yours?

1292
01:24:12.700 --> 01:24:16.470
Cool, Mandi is goin' down!

1293
01:24:27.965 --> 01:24:29.284
I told you.

1294
01:24:29.385 --> 01:24:30.853
Let me see that,
let me see that.

1295
01:24:39.495 --> 01:24:41.663
- Ling... Come on!
- What?

1296
01:24:41.764 --> 01:24:46.333
What are you waitin' for?
This is football! Come on!

1297
01:24:48.236 --> 01:24:51.573
Makin' everyone else do
your dirty work, Mandi?

1298
01:24:51.674 --> 01:24:53.058
You're still gonna lose.

1299
01:24:55.410 --> 01:24:56.945
Give me the ball.

1300
01:24:57.046 --> 01:24:58.413
Now!

1301
01:25:00.064 --> 01:25:02.033
Is that Nick Zimmer?

1302
01:25:05.221 --> 01:25:07.589
One, two,
three... hut.

1303
01:25:10.761 --> 01:25:14.346
No, no, no! No, no!
Come on, man, it was her idea.

1304
01:25:14.447 --> 01:25:18.601
Right there, Mandi! Number one!
You're not number one anymore.

1305
01:25:18.702 --> 01:25:23.190
But I love you, baby. It wasn't my
idea. Why are you handcuffing me?

1306
01:25:54.239 --> 01:25:56.991
- Get off me!
- I'd love to.

1307
01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:00.378
Let me go!
Get off me!

1308
01:26:01.079 --> 01:26:02.131
That's not me!

1309
01:26:02.132 --> 01:26:03.932
It sure looks like it's you,
Miss Weatherly.

1310
01:26:07.838 --> 01:26:10.789
Are you crazy?
Do you know who I am?

1311
01:26:10.973 --> 01:26:14.443
I am Mandi Weatherly!
My mother will sue you!

1312
01:26:14.544 --> 01:26:17.580
How dare you touch me!
She'll sue all of you!

1313
01:26:17.916 --> 01:26:20.667
Let me out of here!
I'll have you fired!

1314
01:26:20.768 --> 01:26:22.635
I'm so sorry for the
misunderstanding, Jo.

1315
01:26:22.736 --> 01:26:25.688
Consider yourself
officially un-expelled.

1316
01:26:25.789 --> 01:26:28.090
And I'll make some calls and
sort things out college-wise.

1317
01:26:28.191 --> 01:26:31.646
Yeah!

1318
01:26:51.332 --> 01:26:52.849
I figured at this point,

1319
01:26:52.950 --> 01:26:55.971
I might as well go for the
whole high school experience.

1320
01:27:11.454 --> 01:27:14.140
All right, quiet down,
everybody. Quiet.

1321
01:27:14.141 --> 01:27:17.592
Stop your dancing, stop your fun.
Stop it right now.

1322
01:27:17.644 --> 01:27:20.229
Quiet down.

1323
01:27:20.330 --> 01:27:23.449
Quieter. Good.

1324
01:27:23.550 --> 01:27:25.451
Well, you should all
be very happy to know...

1325
01:27:25.552 --> 01:27:30.924
that we raised $6,800 for
the Humane Society, huh?

1326
01:27:33.978 --> 01:27:36.430
All right, forget it.
Um, I know the announcement

1327
01:27:36.532 --> 01:27:39.599
you guys really care about,
so let's get to it.

1328
01:27:39.701 --> 01:27:44.002
The Homecoming King is...

1329
01:27:47.257 --> 01:27:50.127
- Elliot Gold?
- My God, it's you!

1330
01:27:50.228 --> 01:27:52.631
- Elliot Gold.
- Go!

1331
01:27:52.732 --> 01:27:57.068
Whoo!

1332
01:27:57.169 --> 01:27:59.403
Wow. Elliot really
is going to rig...

1333
01:27:59.504 --> 01:28:01.640
the presidential election
someday, isn't he?

1334
01:28:01.741 --> 01:28:03.975
Yep. Just as soon as
the voting goes hi-tech.

1335
01:28:04.076 --> 01:28:08.180
Congratulations.

1336
01:28:08.281 --> 01:28:09.982
- Thank you.
- Sure.

1337
01:28:10.083 --> 01:28:13.385
And your Homecoming Queen...

1338
01:28:14.338 --> 01:28:16.422
Abby Hanover.

1339
01:28:16.606 --> 01:28:18.307
Oh, my God!
I've never won anything!

1340
01:28:18.409 --> 01:28:21.928
Go! You won, go!

1341
01:28:22.030 --> 01:28:24.282
Yeah, Abby!

1342
01:28:26.083 --> 01:28:28.234
You won!
That's so awesome!

1343
01:28:28.335 --> 01:28:31.371
- That crown is mine! It's mine!
- Get out of here!

1344
01:28:31.472 --> 01:28:34.373
No, don't reach for me!

1345
01:28:34.475 --> 01:28:37.678
Get out of here! You're not
allowed on school grounds!

1346
01:28:37.779 --> 01:28:41.097
- Get off me!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1347
01:28:42.533 --> 01:28:44.234
Uh,
a little to the right.

1348
01:28:44.335 --> 01:28:47.905
- Give me that.
- I'm legally blind.

1349
01:28:48.541 --> 01:28:50.642
There.

1350
01:28:50.743 --> 01:28:53.543
Here's your Homecoming King
and Queen, let's give it up.

1351
01:28:53.644 --> 01:28:56.698
Make some room, let them
have their first dance.

1352
01:28:56.799 --> 01:29:00.118
You guys have a good time.
No dirty dancing, I'm watching.

1353
01:29:19.441 --> 01:29:23.525
I have a feeling Elliot wasn't
the one who rigged this vote.

1354
01:29:23.626 --> 01:29:26.628
Well, we both know
crowns aren't my thing.

1355
01:29:26.729 --> 01:29:28.797
So you dropped
out of the race?

1356
01:29:28.899 --> 01:29:30.934
Sometimes, it's not
about winning the race,

1357
01:29:31.035 --> 01:29:33.768
it's just about
being a part of it.

1358
01:29:33.869 --> 01:29:36.939
Besides...

1359
01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:40.042
I have enough already.

1360
01:29:55.811 --> 01:29:59.548
OK, well, it's not like we all lived
happily ever after.

1361
01:29:59.649 --> 01:30:02.917
Mandi and Nick did get community
service instead of jail.

1362
01:30:03.018 --> 01:30:06.253
And her mom donated a new
library to North Shore,

1363
01:30:06.354 --> 01:30:08.758
so Principal Duvall
let her graduate.

1364
01:30:08.859 --> 01:30:11.292
But she never
regained her status.

1365
01:30:13.564 --> 01:30:15.998
Quinn took over Mandi's role
as lead Plastic.

1366
01:30:16.098 --> 01:30:17.477
But we had a deal...

1367
01:30:17.482 --> 01:30:20.337
She let the senior class
end their year in peace.

1368
01:30:20.437 --> 01:30:22.027
She also wrote
an award-winning article

1369
01:30:22.030 --> 01:30:24.842
on the "Social Dynamics
of Mean Girls".

1370
01:30:24.942 --> 01:30:30.345
Chastity finally looked up her name,
and joined the Abstinence Club.

1371
01:30:31.046 --> 01:30:32.943
And Hope finally braved
her fear

1372
01:30:32.946 --> 01:30:35.635
of water fountains
and public germs...

1373
01:30:39.908 --> 01:30:41.743
only to catch...

1374
01:30:41.744 --> 01:30:43.443
a nasty case of swine flu.

1375
01:30:43.444 --> 01:30:47.147
From then on, she swore to overcome
her fears, and, instead,

1376
01:30:47.248 --> 01:30:52.053
put her trust in antibiotics
and hot doctors.

1377
01:30:52.154 --> 01:30:54.522
Tyler decided to go
to Penn State,

1378
01:30:54.623 --> 01:30:56.037
which,
by total coincidence,

1379
01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:58.827
was only a few hours
away from my school.

1380
01:30:59.827 --> 01:31:01.495
As for me, I managed to earn...

1381
01:31:01.596 --> 01:31:04.833
my Carnegie Mellon tuition
with Sidney's help after all.

1382
01:31:04.934 --> 01:31:07.602
The man could truly
sell anything,

1383
01:31:07.704 --> 01:31:09.370
even my shop class project.

1384
01:31:09.471 --> 01:31:12.474
A birdhouse and
security camera, all in one.

1385
01:31:12.574 --> 01:31:14.743
Only $19.99.

1386
01:31:14.844 --> 01:31:17.544
Mr. Hanover even compromised
on Abby majoring in art,

1387
01:31:17.645 --> 01:31:19.280
so long as she went
to a top college,

1388
01:31:19.620 --> 01:31:21.451
which worked out
perfectly for me.

1389
01:31:21.551 --> 01:31:23.583
- So how does it look?
- Nice crown.

1390
01:31:23.684 --> 01:31:25.587
Thanks. I thought it
went with the t-shirt.

1391
01:31:27.991 --> 01:31:30.859
So I guess my dad
was right after all.

1392
01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:33.695
To win the race,
you have to be in the race.

1393
01:31:33.796 --> 01:31:35.688
Sometimes it just takes
a little girl drama

1394
01:31:35.690 --> 01:31:38.235
to find out
who your friends are.

1395
01:31:38.635 --> 01:31:42.972
And, once you have that, you
can survive almost anything...

1396
01:31:43.973 --> 01:31:46.710
even high school.
