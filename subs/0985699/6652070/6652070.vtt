1
00:01:48.975 --> 00:01:54.800
The Führer's promises of peace and
prosperity have fallen by the wayside...

2
00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.820
leaving in their wake a
path of destruction.

3
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.300
The outrages commited
by Hitler's SS...

4
00:02:05.301 --> 00:02:09.000
are a stain on teh honor
of the German Army.

5
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:17.400
There is widespread disgust
in the officer corps...

6
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.700
toward the crimes committed
by the Nazis.

7
00:02:21.465 --> 00:02:24.385
The murder of civilians...

8
00:02:24.427 --> 00:02:29.682
the torture and starvation
of prisoners...

9
00:02:30.417 --> 00:02:32.710
... the mass execution of Jews.

10
00:02:34.212 --> 00:02:38.090
My duty as an officer is no
longer to save my country,

11
00:02:38.925 --> 00:02:40.926
but to save human lives.

12
00:02:42.804 --> 00:02:45.848
I cannot find one general in
a position to confront Hitler

13
00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:48.017
with the courage to do it.

14
00:02:48.393 --> 00:02:50.102
Colonel Stauffenberg, sir.

15
00:02:50.187 --> 00:02:52.271
The General will be
here in 4 hours.

16
00:02:52.355 --> 00:02:55.482
Thank you. I'll need to see him
when he arrives.

17
00:02:59.446 --> 00:03:00.988
I find myself surrounded by men

18
00:03:01.072 --> 00:03:03.574
unwilling or unable
to face the truth.

19
00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:07.995
Hitler is not only the archenemy
of the entire world

20
00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:10.289
but the archenemy of Germany.

21
00:03:12.334 --> 00:03:14.793
A change must be made.

22
00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:21.300
Colonel, my orders are to advance
to Sidi Mansour and hold it.

23
00:03:21.384 --> 00:03:22.384
That's what we'll do.

24
00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:24.011
The British are moving up
from the south,

25
00:03:24.095 --> 00:03:25.387
Patton is closing
in on the coast.

26
00:03:25.472 --> 00:03:26.805
You know, we should have left
two days ago.

27
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.557
No, Colonel.

28
00:03:28.642 --> 00:03:31.727
We keep fighting
until the final victory.

29
00:03:31.811 --> 00:03:32.853
North Africa's lost,

30
00:03:32.938 --> 00:03:34.396
and you're going to need
these men a year from now

31
00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:36.148
to defend Berlin.

32
00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.860
We can serve Germany
or the Führer, not both.

33
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.741
It's just that sort of talk that
had you sent here, Colonel.

34
00:03:45.825 --> 00:03:47.952
What I said was much worse.

35
00:03:49.996 --> 00:03:51.288
General.

36
00:03:53.708 --> 00:03:57.002
I'm just trying to get these
men out of here alive.

37
00:04:05.011 --> 00:04:06.595
What would you have me do?

38
00:04:06.721 --> 00:04:08.305
Tell Command we're low on water.

39
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.600
We'd have to reroute to Mezzouna,
join the 21st Panzer.

40
00:04:11.685 --> 00:04:14.144
At least then we'd have a chance.

41
00:04:15.021 --> 00:04:19.358
And the records will show that we didn't have enough
water to reach Sidi Mansour?

42
00:04:19.442 --> 00:04:21.193
I can guarantee it.

43
00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:33.080
See that it's done.

44
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.040
General.

45
00:08:15.803 --> 00:08:16.887
Up!

46
00:08:26.856 --> 00:08:27.981
Down!

47
00:08:46.793 --> 00:08:48.585
- Hitler's leaving.
- Now?

48
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:49.962
Ja. Fuse.

49
00:09:23.496 --> 00:09:26.206
Colonel Brandt!
Colonel Brandt!

50
00:09:28.626 --> 00:09:30.836
My regards to Colonel Stieff.

51
00:09:32.213 --> 00:09:34.339
Cointreau?

52
00:09:34.465 --> 00:09:36.592
Let's hope I don't get thirsty
on the flight.

53
00:10:01.576 --> 00:10:03.243
This is Tresckow.

54
00:10:15.465 --> 00:10:16.882
He's landed.

55
00:10:25.099 --> 00:10:26.516
This is General Tresckow.

56
00:10:26.601 --> 00:10:29.478
Connect me with Operations,
Colonel Brandt.

57
00:10:31.731 --> 00:10:33.398
Colonel! Tresckow.

58
00:10:34.067 --> 00:10:36.902
I'm glad you arrived safely.
I hate to trouble you,

59
00:10:36.986 --> 00:10:40.739
but it seems you have the wrong
bottles for Colonel Stieff.

60
00:10:41.366 --> 00:10:43.617
You do still have the package?

61
00:10:46.871 --> 00:10:47.913
Oh, no, no, no.

62
00:10:47.997 --> 00:10:50.832
As it happens, I've been called
to Berlin unexpectedly.

63
00:10:50.917 --> 00:10:54.211
I can be at your office first thing tomorrow
morning to pick it up.

64
00:10:54.295 --> 00:10:55.921
Sorry for the inconvenience,
Colonel.

65
00:10:56.089 --> 00:10:57.714
Yes, thank you.

66
00:11:00.426 --> 00:11:02.260
Do you think he knows?

67
00:11:03.262 --> 00:11:05.138
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

68
00:11:18.277 --> 00:11:20.362
We've been discovered.
What makes you think that?

69
00:11:20.446 --> 00:11:21.613
Oster's been arrested.

70
00:11:21.698 --> 00:11:23.115
The Gestapo came
for him last night.

71
00:11:23.199 --> 00:11:25.325
The Gestapo could have arrested
him for anything.

72
00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:26.868
What do you think went wrong?

73
00:11:26.953 --> 00:11:28.704
We don't know.

74
00:11:28.788 --> 00:11:30.622
Fuse. Temperature. Altitude.

75
00:11:30.707 --> 00:11:33.208
All I know is the damn thing
didn't go off.

76
00:11:44.011 --> 00:11:46.179
General Tresckow to
see Colonel Brandt.

77
00:11:46.264 --> 00:11:48.807
The Colonel's expecting you, sir.

78
00:11:58.943 --> 00:12:00.193
At ease.

79
00:12:10.037 --> 00:12:11.163
You'll forgive me, General.

80
00:12:11.247 --> 00:12:14.708
This little roundup has had me
writing reports all day.

81
00:12:15.626 --> 00:12:18.044
- Roundup?
- Dissenters.

82
00:12:19.213 --> 00:12:21.089
Another plot against the Führer.

83
00:12:21.174 --> 00:12:23.300
Who are these people?

84
00:12:26.888 --> 00:12:28.680
You'd be surprised.

85
00:12:31.768 --> 00:12:36.980
Now, is this
what you've come for?

86
00:12:45.114 --> 00:12:47.199
Perhaps we should open it.

87
00:12:48.451 --> 00:12:50.160
I beg your pardon?

88
00:12:50.703 --> 00:12:52.120
Well, you've come a long way.

89
00:12:52.205 --> 00:12:54.456
You must be thirsty.

90
00:13:00.379 --> 00:13:03.381
You know, I wonder how the
Führer, who does not partake,

91
00:13:03.466 --> 00:13:06.843
would feel about a soldier
who did so on duty.

92
00:13:13.559 --> 00:13:15.101
Colonel Brandt.

93
00:13:17.897 --> 00:13:20.565
I took you for
another sort, General.

94
00:13:22.401 --> 00:13:23.735
And I you.

95
00:13:32.954 --> 00:13:35.831
We're still in business.

96
00:13:35.915 --> 00:13:37.374
Find a replacement for Oster.

97
00:13:37.458 --> 00:13:40.001
There's no one we can trust,
not in Berlin.

98
00:13:40.086 --> 00:13:42.587
Well, then stop looking in Berlin.

99
00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:11.992
Countess von Stauffenberg?

100
00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:15.579
Perhaps before you go in,
we could have a word together in my office.

101
00:14:15.663 --> 00:14:17.747
I will see my husband now.

102
00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.758
The right hand has been
amputated above the wrist.

103
00:14:28.843 --> 00:14:32.554
He's missing the fourth and fifth
fingers on the left hand.

104
00:14:32.638 --> 00:14:34.890
We couldn't save the left eye.

105
00:15:33.699 --> 00:15:34.991
Colonel.

106
00:15:37.328 --> 00:15:39.245
When you're ready, sir.

107
00:16:21.038 --> 00:16:23.748
I'm a soldier.
I serve my country.

108
00:16:25.626 --> 00:16:27.877
But this is not my country.

109
00:16:27.962 --> 00:16:32.841
I was lying out there bleeding to death,
thinking, "If I die now,

110
00:16:32.925 --> 00:16:35.802
"I leave nothing to
my children but shame."

111
00:16:38.681 --> 00:16:42.100
I know now there's only one way
to serve Germany.

112
00:16:43.602 --> 00:16:47.397
In doing so, I'll be a traitor.
I accept that.

113
00:16:49.025 --> 00:16:52.068
Just tell me,
can these men see it through?

114
00:16:55.072 --> 00:16:59.784
We need to reorganize.
Reconsider our strategy, recruit new men.

115
00:17:01.162 --> 00:17:03.121
That's why we want you.

116
00:17:05.833 --> 00:17:08.960
You understand what will happen
to my wife and children

117
00:17:09.045 --> 00:17:11.504
if these men
can't see it through?

118
00:17:15.051 --> 00:17:17.635
Come and hear what
they have to say.

119
00:17:30.524 --> 00:17:32.609
You know where to find us.

120
00:18:00.054 --> 00:18:03.056
Enough! Enough.
I'm not going to listen to another word of this.

121
00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:05.350
You had your chance,
you failed.

122
00:18:05.434 --> 00:18:08.978
Your so-called
"central solution" didn't work.

123
00:18:09.063 --> 00:18:11.981
Our only option now is to confront
Hitler openly.

124
00:18:12.066 --> 00:18:13.191
This is a military operation ...

125
00:18:13.275 --> 00:18:14.442
It's not
a military operation,

126
00:18:14.527 --> 00:18:15.777
it's a political
organization,

127
00:18:15.861 --> 00:18:18.279
and one that's given its military arm
too much control.

128
00:18:18.364 --> 00:18:19.447
In any military exercise,

129
00:18:19.532 --> 00:18:21.366
you have to expect a certain measure
of deviation.

130
00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:25.161
A measure? A measure?
What about total, complete, utter failure?

131
00:18:25.246 --> 00:18:27.455
Gentlemen,
I think it's time we face the fact

132
00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:31.042
that the Allies are coming,
sooner or later.

133
00:18:31.127 --> 00:18:33.628
I say we sit back and let them
wipe out the Nazis.

134
00:18:33.712 --> 00:18:35.463
And ask every
living soul in Europe

135
00:18:35.548 --> 00:18:36.923
to pay the price?
Use your head.

136
00:18:37.007 --> 00:18:38.967
Karl, please.
I'm sorry, Ludwig.

137
00:18:39.051 --> 00:18:40.635
I've held
my tongue too long.

138
00:18:40.719 --> 00:18:44.347
We must confront Hitler now.
Force him out!

139
00:18:44.431 --> 00:18:45.974
And then what?

140
00:18:47.601 --> 00:18:49.269
I beg your pardon?

141
00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:52.147
When Hitler is gone,
then what?

142
00:18:55.276 --> 00:18:56.818
I'm sorry,
who is this man?

143
00:18:56.902 --> 00:18:59.863
Colonel Stauffenberg
is Oster's replacement.

144
00:18:59.947 --> 00:19:03.449
He's been transferred to my office
at the War Ministry.

145
00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.910
How's your uncle?

146
00:19:06.245 --> 00:19:07.829
He's well, sir.
He sends his regards.

147
00:19:07.913 --> 00:19:09.539
He speaks very
highly of you.

148
00:19:09.623 --> 00:19:11.332
And of you, General.

149
00:19:11.417 --> 00:19:13.793
Of course, one of the things that made Oster
such a great organizer

150
00:19:13.878 --> 00:19:16.171
was that he kept
his opinions to himself.

151
00:19:18.174 --> 00:19:21.885
I'm simply asking what you intend to do
when Hitler is gone.

152
00:19:21.969 --> 00:19:25.013
You don't really believe you could just walk into
the Reich Chancellery

153
00:19:25.097 --> 00:19:27.348
and command the army
to end the war?

154
00:19:27.433 --> 00:19:28.933
Yes. We do.

155
00:19:35.357 --> 00:19:38.860
You are in the presence of men who would have been
Hitler's inner circle.

156
00:19:38.944 --> 00:19:41.446
Instead,
we refused, Colonel.

157
00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:44.991
The people know we put our principles
above personal gain.

158
00:19:45.075 --> 00:19:48.494
We have the respect of the people.
And the army.

159
00:19:51.457 --> 00:19:55.710
Then you don't need me.
Gentlemen.

160
00:19:59.381 --> 00:20:02.175
Those men are confusing
respect with popularity.

161
00:20:02.635 --> 00:20:07.347
The army swore an oath, an oath that won't
just die with Hitler.

162
00:20:07.431 --> 00:20:08.556
What are you going to do?

163
00:20:08.641 --> 00:20:11.059
How are you going to deal with Göbbels?
Himmler? The SS?

164
00:20:11.143 --> 00:20:14.062
They will wipe you out!
It doesn't matter!

165
00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:20.026
It only matters that we act, now,
before we lose the war.

166
00:20:21.153 --> 00:20:24.322
Otherwise, this will always be
Hitler's Germany.

167
00:20:27.243 --> 00:20:31.162
And we have to show the world that not all
of us were like him.

168
00:20:31.789 --> 00:20:33.831
That is not enough for me.

169
00:20:35.167 --> 00:20:37.710
There has to be
a chance of success.

170
00:20:39.255 --> 00:20:40.880
Then find a way.

171
00:20:42.341 --> 00:20:43.633
- Poppy!
- Poppy!

172
00:20:44.093 --> 00:20:46.594
Poppy's home! Poppy's home!
Poppy's here! Poppy's here!

173
00:20:46.679 --> 00:20:47.845
Mommy, he's here!

174
00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:50.640
Mom, come down!
Poppy's here!

175
00:21:01.026 --> 00:21:04.320
I thought we agreed I'd come see you
in Bamberg.

176
00:21:04.446 --> 00:21:07.532
The children couldn't wait.
The children?

177
00:21:49.575 --> 00:21:50.908
Super!

178
00:23:37.683 --> 00:23:38.975
Valkyrie.

179
00:23:39.643 --> 00:23:41.436
We've already considered Valkyrie.
It isn't suitable.

180
00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.646
Not as it's currently written,
but the Colonel has an idea

181
00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:44.939
I think we should consider.

182
00:23:45.065 --> 00:23:46.274
Excuse me.
What is Valkyrie?

183
00:23:46.358 --> 00:23:47.942
Operation Valkyrie.

184
00:23:48.026 --> 00:23:51.320
The Reserve Army has thousands of men
all over Berlin.

185
00:23:51.405 --> 00:23:53.948
Valkyrie is Hitler's
contingency plan

186
00:23:54.032 --> 00:23:56.576
to mobilize those men
during a national emergency.

187
00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:59.078
The sole purpose of the order is to protect
Hitler's government

188
00:23:59.163 --> 00:24:00.538
if he's cut off
or killed.

189
00:24:00.622 --> 00:24:02.290
And what use
is this to us?

190
00:24:02.374 --> 00:24:06.043
Valkyrie is designed
to contain civil unrest.

191
00:24:06.128 --> 00:24:08.880
But what if the SS
were staging a coup?

192
00:24:12.759 --> 00:24:15.928
State Security is trying
to overthrow Hitler.

193
00:24:16.054 --> 00:24:18.181
How would High Command respond?
We would have no choice.

194
00:24:18.265 --> 00:24:19.974
We would declare a military state
of emergency.

195
00:24:20.058 --> 00:24:21.767
Exactly,
and initiate Valkyrie.

196
00:24:21.852 --> 00:24:24.729
Hitler's own Reserve Army,
using Hitler's own plan,

197
00:24:24.813 --> 00:24:29.442
will have no choice but to seize power in Berlin
to prevent the SS takeover.

198
00:24:31.153 --> 00:24:34.197
They'll think they're fighting for Hitler's
government, not against it.

199
00:24:34.281 --> 00:24:37.575
While we quietly put a
new government in place.

200
00:24:38.994 --> 00:24:40.912
But only if he's dead.

201
00:24:42.247 --> 00:24:43.831
That's what you're
saying, isn't it?

202
00:24:43.916 --> 00:24:47.418
How else are you going to convince people the SS
are trying to seize power?

203
00:24:47.503 --> 00:24:49.378
We have to kill Hitler.

204
00:24:49.463 --> 00:24:51.297
I'm disappointed
in you, Colonel.

205
00:24:51.381 --> 00:24:52.798
I thought a man
of your background

206
00:24:52.883 --> 00:24:55.843
would suggest a more
honorable approach.

207
00:24:55.928 --> 00:24:59.555
Your plan has a few
minor obstacles, Colonel.

208
00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:03.017
Firstly, Valkyrie would have to be rewritten
to exclude the SS.

209
00:25:03.101 --> 00:25:05.853
Then I'll need
your help to get a copy.

210
00:25:06.772 --> 00:25:09.106
Rewriting an order
is one thing.

211
00:25:10.609 --> 00:25:12.860
Distributing it is another.

212
00:25:12.945 --> 00:25:14.237
In this case,

213
00:25:14.321 --> 00:25:17.865
we'd be wilfully circulating written
evidence of high treason.

214
00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:20.618
Evidence requiring
Hitler's signature.

215
00:25:26.333 --> 00:25:29.210
Well, we can all draw
straws for that job.

216
00:25:29.962 --> 00:25:31.128
And what about Fromm?

217
00:25:31.255 --> 00:25:32.380
Fromm? Who is Fromm?

218
00:25:32.464 --> 00:25:34.090
He's the commander
of the Reserve Army.

219
00:25:34.174 --> 00:25:35.883
I can put the reserve troops
on alert,

220
00:25:35.968 --> 00:25:38.469
but only Fromm
can initiate Valkyrie.

221
00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:43.891
Can you get to him?

222
00:25:46.853 --> 00:25:50.314
We're running out of time.
Can you get to Fromm?

223
00:25:50.399 --> 00:25:51.607
He's a careerist pig.

224
00:25:51.692 --> 00:25:54.277
But one who's gone as far as he can go
in Hitler's army.

225
00:25:54.361 --> 00:25:56.404
It's no secret he's not happy
about it.

226
00:25:56.488 --> 00:25:59.407
Offer him a key position
in the new regime.

227
00:26:00.158 --> 00:26:02.076
Make him see the light.

228
00:26:10.335 --> 00:26:12.545
Your office is through there.

229
00:26:16.216 --> 00:26:18.551
I have Colonel Stauffenberg
for General Fromm.

230
00:26:18.635 --> 00:26:19.719
Colonel Stauffenberg, sir.

231
00:26:19.803 --> 00:26:21.470
Welcome back to
the War Ministry.

232
00:26:21.555 --> 00:26:22.680
It's an honor, sir.

233
00:26:22.764 --> 00:26:24.765
You're an old woman, Fromm!

234
00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:26.100
I'd send you to the front

235
00:26:26.184 --> 00:26:27.602
if I didn't think
you'd surrender

236
00:26:27.686 --> 00:26:30.062
just to be
Montgomery's whore!

237
00:26:35.736 --> 00:26:36.861
The General
will see you now.

238
00:26:52.377 --> 00:26:54.211
What is it you want?

239
00:26:54.796 --> 00:26:58.382
I wanted to introduce our new man,
Colonel Stauffenberg.

240
00:27:00.552 --> 00:27:02.386
Ah! From Africa.

241
00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:06.849
I ...  I'd offer you my hand,
but I might not get it back.

242
00:27:08.477 --> 00:27:12.480
I'd say the General has lost more important
things this morning.

243
00:27:19.154 --> 00:27:21.906
It's about time they put somebody with
balls into this office.

244
00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:23.741
Please, sit down, Colonel.

245
00:27:23.909 --> 00:27:25.660
And you, Olbricht,
if you must.

246
00:27:38.757 --> 00:27:41.008
They tell me you're critical
of the war, Colonel,

247
00:27:41.093 --> 00:27:43.636
not that you don't seem
to have good reason.

248
00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.680
I am critical of indecision,
General.

249
00:27:45.764 --> 00:27:47.765
In the field?
In Berlin.

250
00:27:50.435 --> 00:27:53.187
So that's why you're here,
I take it, to ...

251
00:27:53.271 --> 00:27:54.438
To make decisions.

252
00:27:54.523 --> 00:27:56.273
I've already made my decision.

253
00:27:56.358 --> 00:27:58.943
I'm here to help
others make theirs.

254
00:28:03.448 --> 00:28:06.242
They say when there's
no clear option,

255
00:28:07.411 --> 00:28:08.828
the best thing
is to do nothing.

256
00:28:08.912 --> 00:28:12.123
We're at war.
We must act.

257
00:28:12.207 --> 00:28:14.125
Sometimes rashly.

258
00:28:16.336 --> 00:28:19.630
And what rash action did you have in mind,
Colonel?

259
00:28:21.007 --> 00:28:25.970
That would be a decision for the supreme military
commander, sir.

260
00:28:26.763 --> 00:28:28.556
A supreme commander.

261
00:28:31.643 --> 00:28:33.894
Second only to
the Chancellor.

262
00:28:39.484 --> 00:28:41.277
If I were that man,

263
00:28:43.655 --> 00:28:46.532
this war would be
going quite differently.

264
00:28:46.992 --> 00:28:49.618
Well, we were thinking
the same thing.

265
00:28:58.336 --> 00:29:01.255
I don't need to remind you

266
00:29:02.924 --> 00:29:05.676
that we've all sworn an oath

267
00:29:08.221 --> 00:29:09.764
to the Führer.

268
00:29:17.189 --> 00:29:20.608
Having said that, I'm going to forget this
conversation ever took place,

269
00:29:20.692 --> 00:29:22.109
in the strict understanding

270
00:29:22.194 --> 00:29:25.029
that such talk never occurs again
under this roof.

271
00:29:25.113 --> 00:29:26.739
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

272
00:29:26.823 --> 00:29:28.616
Now, you can tell
your friends, Colonel,

273
00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:31.285
that I always come down
on the right side.

274
00:29:31.369 --> 00:29:36.165
And as long as the Führer is alive,
you know what side that is.

275
00:29:44.466 --> 00:29:45.758
Heil Hitler.

276
00:29:45.842 --> 00:29:47.885
Heil Hitler.
Heil Hitler.

277
00:30:19.459 --> 00:30:22.753
Of course! Yes!
Very good guess!

278
00:30:46.528 --> 00:30:49.488
You realize how close
I am to Hitler.

279
00:30:49.573 --> 00:30:52.283
With one word I can make
you disappear.

280
00:30:53.368 --> 00:30:55.035
My associates don't know
we've been talking,

281
00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:56.161
if that's what
you're afraid of.

282
00:30:56.246 --> 00:30:57.204
When the SS catch you,

283
00:30:57.289 --> 00:31:00.624
they will pull you apart
like warm bread.

284
00:31:00.709 --> 00:31:03.669
It will be a crime just to have
known you then.

285
00:31:03.753 --> 00:31:07.214
I warn you, don't try
to contact me again.

286
00:31:07.299 --> 00:31:08.799
You won't report me.

287
00:31:08.884 --> 00:31:11.385
Maybe if you had when I first
approached you,

288
00:31:11.469 --> 00:31:14.847
you might have been
keeping your oath.

289
00:31:14.931 --> 00:31:16.390
Now you're just as
guilty as the rest of us.

290
00:31:16.474 --> 00:31:18.809
And you think that makes me
a sympathizer, hey?

291
00:31:18.894 --> 00:31:21.520
Give a man a choice of betraying his fellow
officer or his Führer

292
00:31:21.605 --> 00:31:24.106
and you think his actions
will show you his heart.

293
00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:27.109
It is not that simple.
Yes. Yes, it is.

294
00:31:27.193 --> 00:31:30.905
For the last time, don't push me to
make a decision.

295
00:31:30.989 --> 00:31:33.657
I don't have a choice.
It's clear now.

296
00:31:35.619 --> 00:31:38.454
Without you, there is no hope
of success.

297
00:31:39.039 --> 00:31:41.540
You're nothing but rats
jumping from a sinking ship!

298
00:31:41.625 --> 00:31:43.959
What makes you think
you'll be any different?

299
00:31:44.044 --> 00:31:46.587
What makes you think you're stronger than
the people, the Reich?

300
00:31:46.671 --> 00:31:48.255
The very momentum
of history!

301
00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:49.590
This is going to happen.

302
00:31:49.674 --> 00:31:53.135
Action is inevitable,
as are the consequences.

303
00:31:53.219 --> 00:31:54.720
When they come for me,
I'll do everything I can

304
00:31:54.804 --> 00:31:56.388
to hide what you knew
and when you knew it,

305
00:31:56.473 --> 00:31:58.182
but don't delude yourself.

306
00:31:58.266 --> 00:32:00.309
You were involved in a crime
against your country

307
00:32:00.393 --> 00:32:02.311
long before you met me.

308
00:32:04.522 --> 00:32:07.399
There may still be time
to redeem yourself.

309
00:32:10.946 --> 00:32:13.030
Only God can
judge us now.

310
00:32:20.038 --> 00:32:21.956
Hitler had Operation
Valkyrie designed

311
00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:24.792
to completely secure his government
in six hours.

312
00:32:24.876 --> 00:32:29.505
I'm rewriting the order so we can seize control
of the government in three.

313
00:32:29.589 --> 00:32:31.256
As written, the order spreads
reserve troops

314
00:32:31.341 --> 00:32:33.759
across all of Germany's
19 military districts,

315
00:32:33.843 --> 00:32:37.888
including occupied cities like Paris, Vienna
and Prague.

316
00:32:38.306 --> 00:32:39.682
This is a waste
of resources.

317
00:32:39.766 --> 00:32:43.644
Since all of these districts follow orders from Berlin
without question,

318
00:32:43.728 --> 00:32:46.146
you take Berlin,
you take Germany.

319
00:32:47.524 --> 00:32:49.149
I'm rewriting Valkyrie

320
00:32:49.234 --> 00:32:50.859
to direct the majority
of our strongest units

321
00:32:50.944 --> 00:32:53.112
to focus
entirely on Berlin.

322
00:32:54.406 --> 00:32:55.739
We'll surround
the government quarter,

323
00:32:55.824 --> 00:32:57.908
occupy all SS
and police barracks.

324
00:32:57.993 --> 00:32:59.618
Once we have control
of the government,

325
00:32:59.703 --> 00:33:02.413
we'll shut down
all concentration camps.

326
00:33:02.497 --> 00:33:05.165
Any officers who resist
will be arrested or shot.

327
00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:07.751
I've been transferred
to the front.

328
00:33:11.172 --> 00:33:12.589
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

329
00:33:12.674 --> 00:33:15.509
You know these orders
better than anyone.

330
00:33:15.593 --> 00:33:19.179
That's why I'm putting you in charge of the military
wing of the operation.

331
00:33:19.264 --> 00:33:20.389
Beck agrees.

332
00:33:20.473 --> 00:33:21.557
Why not Olbricht?

333
00:33:21.641 --> 00:33:24.727
No. It's your plan. It's you.

334
00:33:25.812 --> 00:33:27.938
One more thing. You need to be
absolutely certain

335
00:33:28.023 --> 00:33:30.024
no conflicting orders
get out after the flash.

336
00:33:30.108 --> 00:33:32.609
It is not enough
to kill Hitler.

337
00:33:32.694 --> 00:33:34.445
We need to isolate
his chain of command

338
00:33:34.529 --> 00:33:37.072
and cut them off from the outside
world immediately.

339
00:33:37.157 --> 00:33:40.034
Yes, I've already
considered that.

340
00:33:40.118 --> 00:33:41.910
I think I have just
the man who can help.

341
00:33:41.995 --> 00:33:43.829
Who is he?

342
00:33:44.497 --> 00:33:46.331
Perhaps it's better
I don't say.

343
00:33:50.462 --> 00:33:53.255
You know, God promised Abraham
he would not destroy Sodom

344
00:33:53.339 --> 00:33:56.717
if he could find
just 10 righteous men.

345
00:33:56.801 --> 00:34:00.554
I have a feeling that, for Germany,
it may come down to one.

346
00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:08.479
Let's begin.

347
00:34:09.481 --> 00:34:12.274
"The Führer, Adolf Hitler,

348
00:34:15.236 --> 00:34:16.612
"is dead."

349
00:34:23.661 --> 00:34:25.496
Heil Hitler, General.

350
00:34:28.458 --> 00:34:31.960
Would you excuse us,
please? Thank you.

351
00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:42.262
You play the part
of bureaucrat beautifully.

352
00:34:42.347 --> 00:34:43.931
It's the only time
I get to relax.

353
00:34:44.015 --> 00:34:47.559
You've been promoted Chief of Staff
for the Reserve Army.

354
00:34:48.645 --> 00:34:50.771
Excuse me?
Congratulations.

355
00:34:53.274 --> 00:34:55.984
I am busy with other things.
Unfortunately,

356
00:34:56.069 --> 00:34:59.613
your nocturnal activities don't count as service
to the Reich.

357
00:34:59.697 --> 00:35:00.823
I'll refuse the promotion.

358
00:35:00.907 --> 00:35:03.033
You'll do no such thing.

359
00:35:03.118 --> 00:35:05.702
Tresckow may have left you
in charge of the operation,

360
00:35:05.787 --> 00:35:07.621
but in this world
I still outrank you.

361
00:35:07.705 --> 00:35:10.124
You will accept
the promotion.

362
00:35:10.208 --> 00:35:12.167
You'll have real
access to Hitler,

363
00:35:12.252 --> 00:35:15.379
his advisers, his schedule.
We need this.

364
00:35:18.133 --> 00:35:21.051
I've looked through
your changes to Valkyrie.

365
00:35:21.719 --> 00:35:23.178
I approve.

366
00:35:23.263 --> 00:35:24.847
I'll need you to get
Hitler to sign it.

367
00:35:29.561 --> 00:35:32.729
Now. There's a man here
to interview as your adjutant.

368
00:35:32.814 --> 00:35:34.982
He comes highly recommended.

369
00:35:41.739 --> 00:35:43.323
Close the door.

370
00:35:47.662 --> 00:35:49.037
Be seated.

371
00:35:52.834 --> 00:35:55.836
Do you know how this war
will end, Lieutenant?

372
00:35:56.629 --> 00:35:58.797
The portrait will be un-hung,

373
00:36:00.091 --> 00:36:02.092
and the man will be hung.

374
00:36:09.726 --> 00:36:12.811
I'm engaged in high treason
with all means available to me.

375
00:36:12.896 --> 00:36:14.646
Can I count you in?

376
00:36:22.405 --> 00:36:25.115
For anything, sir.
Anything at all.

377
00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:27.678
Come. Come, come.

378
00:37:35.228 --> 00:37:37.229
Colonel Brandt, Operations.

379
00:37:37.313 --> 00:37:42.276
Colonel Stauffenberg, I'd like to review your
presentation to the Führer.

380
00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:43.402
Strictly routine.

381
00:37:43.486 --> 00:37:44.778
Sir, the contents
of the Colonel's bag

382
00:37:44.862 --> 00:37:45.946
are for the Führer's
eyes only.

383
00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:48.073
I am the Führer's eyes,
Lieutenant.

384
00:37:48.157 --> 00:37:50.242
The Colonel is a member of my staff
at the War Ministry.

385
00:37:50.326 --> 00:37:52.369
He doesn't answer to you.

386
00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:57.833
They're waiting.
This way.

387
00:38:34.287 --> 00:38:37.164
My Führer. May I present
Colonel Stauffenberg,

388
00:38:37.248 --> 00:38:40.167
our new chief of staff
for the Reserve Army.

389
00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:42.586
Heil, my Führer.

390
00:38:47.759 --> 00:38:50.469
May I say what an honor it is
to meet an officer

391
00:38:50.553 --> 00:38:55.265
who has sacrificed
so much for Germany.

392
00:39:01.606 --> 00:39:04.232
If only more of my men
were like you.

393
00:39:05.943 --> 00:39:08.236
Let this man stand as an example
to all of you.

394
00:39:08.321 --> 00:39:11.114
He is the ideal
German officer.

395
00:39:13.493 --> 00:39:17.371
My Führer. Colonel Stauffenberg was
asked to come here today

396
00:39:17.455 --> 00:39:21.500
to brief us on mobilizing troops of
the Reserve Army to ...

397
00:39:21.584 --> 00:39:23.460
To repel the invasion.

398
00:39:25.088 --> 00:39:26.380
Invasion?

399
00:39:27.924 --> 00:39:30.467
At Normandy, my Führer.

400
00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:33.762
Oh, yes.

401
00:39:35.473 --> 00:39:36.765
Normandy.

402
00:39:38.142 --> 00:39:40.060
That will not
be necessary.

403
00:39:41.396 --> 00:39:46.191
Reichsmarschall Göring assures me that everything
is completely under control.

404
00:39:48.986 --> 00:39:50.737
Thank you, Colonel.

405
00:39:54.659 --> 00:39:56.910
My Führer, if I may.

406
00:39:56.994 --> 00:40:00.956
I have an amended copy of Operation Valkyrie
for your approval.

407
00:40:52.258 --> 00:40:54.551
You know your Wagner,
Colonel?

408
00:41:00.933 --> 00:41:05.395
The Valkyrie.
Handmaidens of the Gods,

409
00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:10.567
choosing who will live and who will die,
sparing the most heroic

410
00:41:12.236 --> 00:41:14.404
from an agonizing death.

411
00:41:19.994 --> 00:41:22.746
One cannot understand
National Socialism

412
00:41:24.665 --> 00:41:27.125
if one does not
understand Wagner.

413
00:41:43.643 --> 00:41:47.145
I'm sure whatever changes you've made
are for the best.

414
00:41:52.193 --> 00:41:55.403
You're dismissed. Send your man home.
And, Fromm?

415
00:41:56.322 --> 00:41:59.115
Have some fresh tea
brought in, will you?

416
00:42:10.753 --> 00:42:14.381
I don't know what you're brewing
up, and I don't want to know.

417
00:42:14.465 --> 00:42:16.258
But when
the music stops,

418
00:42:16.342 --> 00:42:19.844
I'd be obliged if Keitel found himself
without a chair.

419
00:42:33.067 --> 00:42:35.360
Any problem on Earth
can be solved

420
00:42:35.444 --> 00:42:38.738
with the careful application
of high explosives.

421
00:42:38.823 --> 00:42:42.200
The trick is not to be around
when they go off.

422
00:42:42.285 --> 00:42:45.245
Two 975-gram
packs of Plastit W.

423
00:42:45.329 --> 00:42:47.747
Enough explosive
to cripple a panzer.

424
00:42:47.832 --> 00:42:51.501
Your detonators, your fuses.
British time pencils.

425
00:42:52.295 --> 00:42:55.630
This acid capsule is your trigger.
When you're ready to arm,

426
00:42:55.715 --> 00:43:00.594
attach the detonator to the bottom of
the time pencil, like so,

427
00:43:00.678 --> 00:43:04.514
insert the entire device into
either end of the Plastit W,

428
00:43:04.599 --> 00:43:08.685
crush the acid capsule,
and you're live.

429
00:43:10.396 --> 00:43:14.941
When the acid eats through the wire
holding back the firing pin,

430
00:43:15.026 --> 00:43:17.694
well, you'll want
to be very far away.

431
00:43:20.948 --> 00:43:22.198
For you.

432
00:43:22.908 --> 00:43:23.992
How much time
will we have?

433
00:43:24.076 --> 00:43:25.785
Theoretically
there's a 30-minute delay,

434
00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:28.288
but with the kind of heat you can expect
at the Wolf's Lair,

435
00:43:28.372 --> 00:43:30.540
I'd give you
10, 15 minutes, tops.

436
00:43:30.625 --> 00:43:32.500
That's hardly precise.

437
00:43:32.585 --> 00:43:36.046
This is state-of-the-art. You can have small
or precise, not both.

438
00:43:36.130 --> 00:43:38.298
Might this just be
a little too small?

439
00:43:38.382 --> 00:43:41.760
No. Hitler's bunker
will magnify the blast.

440
00:43:41.844 --> 00:43:45.805
It is constructed of reinforced concrete.
Steel door, no windows.

441
00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:49.225
The air pressure generated by just one of these explosives
in a space like that

442
00:43:49.310 --> 00:43:51.061
will kill everyone
instantly.

443
00:43:51.145 --> 00:43:53.396
The second charge
will be entirely redundant.

444
00:43:53.481 --> 00:43:57.317
Lf, by some miracle, Hitler does survive,
what then?

445
00:43:57.401 --> 00:43:59.736
We still initiate Valkyrie.

446
00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:02.155
At that point, there will be
no turning back.

447
00:44:02.239 --> 00:44:04.407
But we'll have
an advantage.

448
00:44:05.743 --> 00:44:08.161
We have an inside man
at the Wolf's Lair.

449
00:44:08.245 --> 00:44:11.122
After the flash, he'll cut off communication
with the outside world.

450
00:44:11.207 --> 00:44:13.500
While Hitler's inner circle
is struggling to regroup,

451
00:44:13.584 --> 00:44:17.295
we'll have the momentum we need to
seize control in Berlin.

452
00:44:18.339 --> 00:44:20.590
Himmler is expected to be
at the meeting as well.

453
00:44:20.675 --> 00:44:23.510
Don't proceed unless
you can get them both.

454
00:44:23.594 --> 00:44:25.095
What?

455
00:44:25.179 --> 00:44:29.724
Don't proceed unless you're confident you can get
both Himmler and Hitler.

456
00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:38.108
This is Gördeler, isn't it?

457
00:44:42.113 --> 00:44:44.864
I'll hold off, if the decision
is unanimous,

458
00:44:44.949 --> 00:44:48.910
but I want another man on the committee.
Not a politician.

459
00:44:48.994 --> 00:44:51.287
- Who?
- Him.

460
00:44:52.373 --> 00:44:54.249
- Him?
- Him.

461
00:44:55.167 --> 00:44:56.292
Fine.

462
00:44:57.586 --> 00:45:00.839
But remember,
this is a military operation.

463
00:45:01.632 --> 00:45:04.467
Nothing ever goes
according to plan.

464
00:45:33.998 --> 00:45:36.458
I'll take the children
to Bamberg.

465
00:45:43.507 --> 00:45:44.841
If I fail,

466
00:45:48.512 --> 00:45:50.346
they'll come for you.

467
00:45:52.057 --> 00:45:53.475
All of you.

468
00:45:57.354 --> 00:45:58.563
I know.

469
00:46:25.591 --> 00:46:27.300
Gentlemen.
Good morning.

470
00:46:27.384 --> 00:46:31.304
Hitler has scheduled a military
briefing for today at 1:00.

471
00:46:31.388 --> 00:46:33.890
Stauffenberg will start
once everyone is present.

472
00:46:34.350 --> 00:46:36.726
- They're here.
- Before arming the explosives,

473
00:46:36.811 --> 00:46:39.687
Stauffenberg will call
for authorization to proceed.

474
00:46:39.772 --> 00:46:41.981
After the flash,
his inside man

475
00:46:42.066 --> 00:46:44.651
will sever all communications.

476
00:46:44.735 --> 00:46:47.237
Assuming Fromm
refuses to join us,

477
00:46:47.321 --> 00:46:49.489
Olbricht would take command
of the Reserve Army

478
00:46:49.573 --> 00:46:51.491
and initiate Valkyrie.
Initiate Valkyrie.

479
00:46:51.575 --> 00:46:53.243
Then he'll notify
all district commanders

480
00:46:53.327 --> 00:46:55.912
that the SS is attempting
to seize power.

481
00:46:55.996 --> 00:47:00.416
The Reserve Army will arrest all SS, Gestapo
and Nazi officials.

482
00:47:00.501 --> 00:47:02.669
By then, Stauffenberg
will have returned to Berlin

483
00:47:02.753 --> 00:47:05.171
and taken command
of the Reserve Army.

484
00:47:05.256 --> 00:47:08.925
Witzleben and I will assume the roles of commander of
the armed forces

485
00:47:09.009 --> 00:47:10.510
and head of state.

486
00:47:10.594 --> 00:47:11.761
With Berlin secured,

487
00:47:11.846 --> 00:47:14.889
Dr. Gördeler will address the nation
as our new chancellor.

488
00:47:15.474 --> 00:47:17.809
Then, God willing,

489
00:47:17.893 --> 00:47:20.061
we can negotiate a truce
with the Allies

490
00:47:20.145 --> 00:47:22.772
and save Europe from
total destruction.

491
00:47:25.067 --> 00:47:28.027
This will identify you
as a member of the operation.

492
00:47:28.112 --> 00:47:31.406
Nobody gets in or out of
the perimeter without one.

493
00:47:33.075 --> 00:47:36.995
Gentlemen, this is the most important day
of your lives.

494
00:47:40.124 --> 00:47:42.166
Long live sacred Germany.

495
00:48:19.538 --> 00:48:21.247
Captain.
What is it?

496
00:48:21.332 --> 00:48:22.999
An order from General Olbricht's office.

497
00:48:23.083 --> 00:48:25.627
It's calling the Reserve Army for
some sort of standby action

498
00:48:25.711 --> 00:48:29.339
in all the military districts,
including Berlin.

499
00:48:29.423 --> 00:48:32.175
Looks like a drill of some kind.
Send it through, Sergeant.

500
00:48:52.404 --> 00:48:53.529
Sir?

501
00:48:59.370 --> 00:49:02.914
"Standby action"?
What the hell for?

502
00:49:02.998 --> 00:49:04.374
The order doesn't say.

503
00:49:05.876 --> 00:49:09.128
Assemble the men.
This better not be a drill.

504
00:50:51.148 --> 00:50:54.358
The men are assembled
and awaiting further orders.

505
00:50:54.443 --> 00:50:57.403
What do you suppose
this is really all about?

506
00:53:19.463 --> 00:53:20.755
Your man?

507
00:53:32.059 --> 00:53:33.434
He is now.

508
00:54:52.931 --> 00:54:54.223
Colonel.

509
00:55:06.403 --> 00:55:07.778
Attention!

510
00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:23.336
Gentlemen. For our first order
of business,

511
00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:25.963
General Fromm
will present his plans

512
00:55:26.048 --> 00:55:29.842
for the reallocation of troops from the Reserve Army
on the eastern front.

513
00:55:29.926 --> 00:55:32.887
Now, as you know,
last night the Russians launched a new offensive

514
00:55:32.971 --> 00:55:37.016
against Army Group North Ukraine in
the South Poland section.

515
00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:40.227
General Harpe was brought in
to replace Model

516
00:55:40.312 --> 00:55:43.022
and bring a swift end
to this confrontation.

517
00:55:43.106 --> 00:55:44.440
Himmler is not here.

518
00:55:44.524 --> 00:55:45.816
Hence the transfer
of three divisions

519
00:55:45.901 --> 00:55:50.488
to fortify
General Harpe's troops.

520
00:55:51.156 --> 00:55:55.701
Now, these divisions will stick to
a mobile defense plan

521
00:55:55.786 --> 00:55:58.079
rather than holding
any one particular ...

522
00:56:03.210 --> 00:56:06.337
Yes, sir. I'll put that right through.
Connecting now.

523
00:56:06.463 --> 00:56:08.464
Operator.
Direct me to the War Ministry.

524
00:56:08.548 --> 00:56:10.216
General Olbricht's office.
One moment, please.

525
00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:12.343
Yes, sir.
Connecting now.

526
00:56:16.223 --> 00:56:17.306
General Olbricht's office.

527
00:56:17.432 --> 00:56:18.474
Himmler's not
in the briefing.

528
00:56:18.558 --> 00:56:20.184
I'm ready to arm.
Permission to proceed.

529
00:56:20.477 --> 00:56:22.228
Hold the line.

530
00:56:22.312 --> 00:56:26.190
Stauffenberg says Himmler's
not at the briefing. He wants to proceed.

531
00:56:26.274 --> 00:56:27.608
Call Beck.

532
00:56:30.404 --> 00:56:31.404
Beck.

533
00:56:31.488 --> 00:56:33.072
Himmler is not at the briefing.

534
00:56:34.533 --> 00:56:36.826
Himmler's not
at the briefing.

535
00:56:46.753 --> 00:56:49.088
Already diminished reserves.

536
00:56:52.008 --> 00:56:53.092
No.

537
00:56:57.264 --> 00:56:58.431
They say no.

538
00:57:01.852 --> 00:57:03.519
What do you say?

539
00:57:08.358 --> 00:57:09.775
I say do it.

540
00:57:10.652 --> 00:57:12.027
Attention!

541
00:57:47.063 --> 00:57:50.608
Whatever it was, Colonel,
I hope it was important.

542
00:57:52.944 --> 00:57:55.529
Colonel? Your bag.

543
00:58:20.055 --> 00:58:23.599
This has been a drill!
You're dismissed!

544
00:58:27.604 --> 00:58:30.981
How dare you put the Reserve Army on standby
without my knowledge?

545
00:58:31.066 --> 00:58:32.691
Damn near cost me
my commission.

546
00:58:32.776 --> 00:58:35.402
And what in God's name made you think you even
had the authority?

547
00:58:35.487 --> 00:58:36.904
It was only a drill,
an exercise.

548
00:58:36.988 --> 00:58:39.782
Oh, don't lie, Olbricht!
Not to me.

549
00:58:40.450 --> 00:58:41.909
We both know it
wasn't a drill.

550
00:58:41.993 --> 00:58:43.035
General, if I may ...

551
00:58:43.119 --> 00:58:44.495
No, you may not, Colonel.

552
00:58:44.579 --> 00:58:46.205
You may not do anything.

553
00:58:46.289 --> 00:58:48.374
Because not only have you proved to me
you can't deliver,

554
00:58:48.458 --> 00:58:51.126
you've painted
a target on my back.

555
00:58:51.211 --> 00:58:55.172
If I so much as sense you trying to move
the Reserve Army again,

556
00:58:55.257 --> 00:58:58.092
I will personally
have you both arrested.

557
00:59:00.303 --> 00:59:03.180
Do I make myself
abundantly clear?

558
00:59:03.265 --> 00:59:05.057
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

559
00:59:09.479 --> 00:59:11.522
Heil Hitler.
Heil Hitler.

560
00:59:13.650 --> 00:59:15.943
I'll hear you
say it, Colonel.

561
00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:26.537
Heil Hitler!

562
00:59:37.299 --> 00:59:40.593
The point of replacing Hitler is to negotiate a truce
with the Allies.

563
00:59:40.677 --> 00:59:43.095
The Allies, I suspect,
would be more amenable to a truce

564
00:59:43.179 --> 00:59:46.223
if we offer it to them before they get
to fucking Berlin!

565
00:59:46.308 --> 00:59:49.685
There's no point in killing Hitler unless
you kill Himmler, too.

566
00:59:49.769 --> 00:59:52.271
Why remove a madman just to have a lunatic
take his place?

567
00:59:52.355 --> 00:59:55.107
Today's failure had nothing to do with Himmler,
and you know it.

568
00:59:55.191 --> 00:59:58.819
This is a military operation
in the hands of a politician, nothing more.

569
00:59:58.945 --> 01:00:01.238
What are you suggesting?
I'm not suggesting anything.

570
01:00:01.323 --> 01:00:03.324
I'm stating the facts
as I see them.

571
01:00:03.408 --> 01:00:04.867
You don't have the courage
to kill Hitler,

572
01:00:04.951 --> 01:00:06.368
so you are making
the task impossible.

573
01:00:06.453 --> 01:00:09.580
Nothing seemed to stop you and your henchman
from trying it on your own.

574
01:00:09.664 --> 01:00:11.832
My only regret is that I waited for you
to find your backbone.

575
01:00:11.916 --> 01:00:15.002
I don't think I'm alone when I say
your judgment is in question.

576
01:00:15.086 --> 01:00:17.004
I'd like to call a vote.
Karl.

577
01:00:17.088 --> 01:00:20.424
I propose that we relieve
Colonel Stauffenberg.

578
01:00:21.968 --> 01:00:24.637
Karl, can I have a word
with you in private?

579
01:00:24.721 --> 01:00:27.640
No, Ludwig. If you've got something
to say, say it.

580
01:00:27.724 --> 01:00:31.143
Very well. I heard from the Chief of Police
this evening

581
01:00:31.227 --> 01:00:34.480
that Himmler has issued a warrant
for your arrest.

582
01:00:37.275 --> 01:00:39.818
You have to leave
Germany tonight.

583
01:00:39.903 --> 01:00:42.946
When we succeed with
the central solution,

584
01:00:43.031 --> 01:00:45.491
you'll return
as chancellor.

585
01:00:45.575 --> 01:00:49.328
Disappear, Karl.
Avoid contact with anyone.

586
01:01:04.552 --> 01:01:06.303
Good luck, Colonel.

587
01:01:13.103 --> 01:01:14.978
No more indecision.

588
01:01:15.063 --> 01:01:17.648
From now on, Stauffenberg has
full discretion.

589
01:01:17.732 --> 01:01:20.859
I can't issue the alert again
unless we follow through.

590
01:01:20.944 --> 01:01:24.196
I'll do my job.
You just take Berlin.

591
01:01:31.871 --> 01:01:32.913
Hold on, sir.

592
01:01:32.997 --> 01:01:34.331
I'll try to connect
you right now.

593
01:01:34.416 --> 01:01:35.791
Thank you.

594
01:01:35.875 --> 01:01:37.459
- Hello?
- Hello?

595
01:01:38.878 --> 01:01:40.087
Hello?

596
01:01:43.133 --> 01:01:44.299
Hello?

597
01:01:45.969 --> 01:01:50.222
I'm sorry, sir. There is bombing in Ebingen.
We've been disconnected.

598
01:01:51.474 --> 01:01:53.267
Ebingen is a long
way from Bamberg.

599
01:01:53.393 --> 01:01:55.227
I'm sure your family is safe.

600
01:01:55.311 --> 01:01:56.645
Thank you.

601
01:03:35.578 --> 01:03:37.162
Welcome, Colonel.

602
01:03:37.247 --> 01:03:40.415
Do you have a place
where I could change, Major?

603
01:03:41.125 --> 01:03:42.751
Please follow me.

604
01:03:49.884 --> 01:03:52.094
At least put the Reserve Army
on standby alert.

605
01:03:52.178 --> 01:03:54.179
Not until I've heard from Stauffenberg.
Not until I'm sure.

606
01:03:54.264 --> 01:03:57.724
But that's not what he ...
Noted, Colonel. Thank you.

607
01:04:09.612 --> 01:04:12.197
The meeting has been
moved up to 12:30.

608
01:04:12.282 --> 01:04:15.158
Mussolini is arriving
on the afternoon train.

609
01:04:15.243 --> 01:04:17.536
- The Führer wants to have lunch with him.
- Yes, sir.

610
01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:21.039
Will Mussolini be joining us
in the briefing, sir?

611
01:04:21.124 --> 01:04:22.457
I only wish he were.

612
01:04:22.542 --> 01:04:25.168
Then some ambitious officer
might take the opportunity

613
01:04:25.253 --> 01:04:27.379
to shoot that dago bastard.

614
01:04:29.299 --> 01:04:31.967
Excuse me, General.
I'm expecting an important call.

615
01:04:32.051 --> 01:04:34.261
Could you please have
someone come and get me?

616
01:04:34.345 --> 01:04:37.055
Even if I'm with
the Führer.

617
01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:39.725
Of course, Colonel.
Thank you, sir.

618
01:04:40.977 --> 01:04:42.269
Colonel.

619
01:05:15.887 --> 01:05:17.846
Major Freyend speaking.

620
01:05:27.482 --> 01:05:30.609
Colonel?
They insist you hurry.

621
01:05:31.778 --> 01:05:33.654
The briefing's
about to begin.

622
01:05:33.863 --> 01:05:35.906
One moment,
please, Major.

623
01:05:42.205 --> 01:05:44.456
Ten minutes. Two for the walk,
one for the checkpoint,

624
01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:47.042
one for the bunker,
six to get out.

625
01:05:47.669 --> 01:05:49.211
Plenty of time.

626
01:05:53.216 --> 01:05:55.008
Excuse me, Colonel.

627
01:05:57.553 --> 01:06:00.013
Sir! The Führer's
at the briefing!

628
01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:08.313
The Colonel
is changing, Major.

629
01:06:11.567 --> 01:06:15.112
You understand this can be difficult.
Of course.

630
01:06:30.086 --> 01:06:31.670
Plenty of time.

631
01:06:56.654 --> 01:06:59.364
- Get the car.
- But, sir ...

632
01:06:59.449 --> 01:07:02.117
I have everything
I need. Get the car.

633
01:07:31.105 --> 01:07:32.814
I can manage this.

634
01:07:45.828 --> 01:07:47.662
Where are they going?
It's too hot.

635
01:07:47.747 --> 01:07:50.999
The briefing has been moved
to the conference hut.

636
01:08:15.858 --> 01:08:17.943
Major, my injuries have
left me hard of hearing.

637
01:08:18.027 --> 01:08:20.403
Would you place me as close to the Führer
as possible?

638
01:08:20.488 --> 01:08:21.446
I'll see what I can do.

639
01:08:21.531 --> 01:08:22.572
... against the Red Army.

640
01:08:24.158 --> 01:08:25.867
Not only have they been
advancing from the east,

641
01:08:25.952 --> 01:08:30.372
but they're coming down on the northern and
the southern fronts as well.

642
01:08:32.250 --> 01:08:35.377
As you can see, my Führer,
if the enemy continues at this rate,

643
01:08:35.461 --> 01:08:38.880
the situation in the East Prussian
sector is critical.

644
01:08:39.632 --> 01:08:43.218
Lack of supplies is continuing to weaken
our main units,

645
01:08:43.302 --> 01:08:45.303
and reserves are
severely depleted.

646
01:08:45.388 --> 01:08:48.390
My Führer, you remember
Colonel Stauffenberg?

647
01:08:56.357 --> 01:08:57.941
As you are all aware,

648
01:08:58.025 --> 01:09:01.903
in the past two days alone,
the 10th Army has given up Ancona,

649
01:09:01.988 --> 01:09:04.990
the 14th Division has been pushed out
of Livorno.

650
01:09:05.074 --> 01:09:08.827
Army Group Center has already lost 28
of their 40 divisions.

651
01:09:09.579 --> 01:09:12.747
That is a total of
almost 350,000 men.

652
01:09:18.129 --> 01:09:21.882
Since the Red Army first attacked
nearly a month ago,

653
01:09:21.966 --> 01:09:25.260
our troops have already been pushed back
to the Polish border.

654
01:09:26.679 --> 01:09:28.221
Conference hut.

655
01:09:28.306 --> 01:09:31.850
This, compounded with the loss
of the 4th Army in Minsk,

656
01:09:31.976 --> 01:09:34.895
threatens the entire eastern perimeter.
Yes, sir.

657
01:09:34.979 --> 01:09:38.356
We must consider pulling men from
Army Group North Ukraine,

658
01:09:38.441 --> 01:09:39.941
as well as the Romanian ...

659
01:09:45.698 --> 01:09:47.741
... and prevent
further losses.

660
01:09:47.825 --> 01:09:50.827
Unless we can quickly dispatch
new blocking divisions

661
01:09:50.912 --> 01:09:53.955
at vital points
along the German right,

662
01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:55.373
Army Group
will be swallowed ...

663
01:09:55.458 --> 01:09:57.083
Colonel.
There's a telephone call for you.

664
01:09:57.168 --> 01:09:58.543
... by the enemy in
less than a fortnight.

665
01:09:58.628 --> 01:10:02.422
And we run the risk of losing all the ground
we have managed to gain

666
01:10:02.506 --> 01:10:06.343
in the last three years.
Our spearhead ...

667
01:10:06.427 --> 01:10:09.471
General Fellgiebel, sir.
He says it's urgent.

668
01:10:12.850 --> 01:10:15.393
Yes, General,
this is Stauffenberg.

669
01:10:18.564 --> 01:10:23.109
... Russian air activity has proven just as impregnable
as their ground force.

670
01:10:23.194 --> 01:10:25.320
- Why?
- My Führer ...

671
01:10:32.453 --> 01:10:35.455
In some areas they outnumber us
seven to one.

672
01:10:35.998 --> 01:10:38.291
If we can afford
to give ground

673
01:10:38.376 --> 01:10:40.794
along the Italian
front, I further ...

674
01:10:44.006 --> 01:10:46.049
One thing is certain,

675
01:10:46.133 --> 01:10:49.886
the Red Army will continue
an aggressive push west,

676
01:10:49.971 --> 01:10:51.012
even at the expense ...

677
01:10:55.601 --> 01:10:57.519
In order to rebuild at this ...

678
01:11:03.901 --> 01:11:06.278
... already southwest of Düneburg

679
01:11:06.362 --> 01:11:09.197
and closing on
Army Group at Lake Peipus.

680
01:11:09.282 --> 01:11:13.743
If they are not immediately withdrawn,
it will be a catastrophe.

681
01:11:35.725 --> 01:11:39.227
Get in. Drive.

682
01:11:41.063 --> 01:11:43.690
I have orders
from the Führer. Drive.

683
01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:46.651
Drive! Drive!

684
01:11:50.197 --> 01:11:51.614
As you were.

685
01:12:23.230 --> 01:12:26.524
Get me the War Ministry.
General Olbricht. Olbricht!

686
01:12:26.609 --> 01:12:28.360
The call is urgent!

687
01:12:32.865 --> 01:12:34.032
General Olbricht's office.

688
01:12:34.116 --> 01:12:35.658
I'm calling from the Wolf's Lair

689
01:12:35.743 --> 01:12:38.453
with an urgent message
for General Olbricht.

690
01:12:38.537 --> 01:12:42.540
Something terrible has happened.
The Führer is ...

691
01:12:44.794 --> 01:12:46.169
Fellgiebel?

692
01:12:47.797 --> 01:12:49.381
Sever all communications.

693
01:12:49.465 --> 01:12:51.132
Sir?
Just do it!

694
01:12:54.387 --> 01:12:58.306
- Well, what did he say?
- I couldn't be sure.

695
01:12:59.433 --> 01:13:01.768
Well, get him
back on the line.

696
01:13:03.479 --> 01:13:06.356
Sir, the bomb did go off.
That much was clear.

697
01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:09.484
Fellgiebel's next step will be
to sever all communications.

698
01:13:20.329 --> 01:13:21.996
Sorry, Colonel.
No one gets in or out.

699
01:13:22.081 --> 01:13:23.331
We have an order
from the Führer.

700
01:13:23.416 --> 01:13:25.583
We have to get to the airfield immediately.
Open the gate.

701
01:13:25.668 --> 01:13:27.419
I'm very sorry,
but my orders are to keep the gate ...

702
01:13:27.503 --> 01:13:29.337
I just gave you
an order, Sergeant.

703
01:13:30.005 --> 01:13:31.339
Sir!

704
01:13:31.424 --> 01:13:33.591
Sir. Excuse me.

705
01:13:41.225 --> 01:13:44.269
Colonel Stauffenberg
for Field Marshal Keitel.

706
01:13:50.568 --> 01:13:52.068
Colonel Stauffenberg
was explicit.

707
01:13:52.153 --> 01:13:53.736
We initiate
Valkyrie regardless.

708
01:13:53.821 --> 01:13:55.447
Only Fromm can initiate.
You know that.

709
01:13:55.531 --> 01:13:56.614
Then tell him
Hitler's dead.

710
01:13:56.699 --> 01:13:58.408
Or arrest him.
But do it now.

711
01:13:58.492 --> 01:14:02.328
Sir, you have to give the order to initiate Valkyrie.
This is our only ...

712
01:14:02.413 --> 01:14:04.497
I'm not doing anything
until I hear from Fellgiebel.

713
01:14:04.582 --> 01:14:05.832
Get him back
on the phone now.

714
01:14:05.916 --> 01:14:08.293
Every second we stand here arguing
is a second lost.

715
01:14:08.377 --> 01:14:09.794
The risk is too great.

716
01:14:09.879 --> 01:14:12.797
What about Stauffenberg?
What about his risk?

717
01:14:12.882 --> 01:14:15.216
He did his part,
and now you're abandoning him.

718
01:14:16.510 --> 01:14:18.136
Field Marshal, sir.
Stauffenberg here.

719
01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:19.804
A Sergeant ...

720
01:14:19.889 --> 01:14:21.139
Kolbe, sir.

721
01:14:21.223 --> 01:14:22.849
What?
Kolbe.

722
01:14:22.933 --> 01:14:25.477
... Kolbe won't let me
pass the main gate.

723
01:14:25.561 --> 01:14:27.604
Yes, sir, I explained that.

724
01:14:27.688 --> 01:14:30.440
Perhaps you can make
him understand, sir.

725
01:14:35.779 --> 01:14:38.406
Everything's fine now, sir.
Thank you.

726
01:14:41.744 --> 01:14:43.244
Open the gate!

727
01:14:52.087 --> 01:14:53.671
At least put the Reserve Army
on alert.

728
01:14:53.756 --> 01:14:55.340
When Stauffenberg returns,

729
01:14:55.424 --> 01:14:59.677
when he gives me confirmation that Hitler is dead,
then we'll proceed.

730
01:15:05.809 --> 01:15:07.435
And where are you going?

731
01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:10.021
The same place
as you are. Lunch.

732
01:16:52.291 --> 01:16:54.208
Another standby alert.

733
01:16:57.004 --> 01:16:59.672
Send it through.
But keep me informed.

734
01:17:23.197 --> 01:17:26.574
Sir. Another standby order.

735
01:17:29.745 --> 01:17:33.247
In ancient Greece,
you would have been killed for this.

736
01:17:34.375 --> 01:17:36.542
Lucky for you we've evolved.

737
01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:41.547
Assemble the men.

738
01:18:30.639 --> 01:18:32.265
Quiet, isn't it?

739
01:18:34.601 --> 01:18:36.811
I'll see where
our driver is.

740
01:18:39.982 --> 01:18:41.691
This is von Häften.
The Colonel and I are at the airfield.

741
01:18:41.775 --> 01:18:43.317
There's no car.
There's no one here.

742
01:18:45.529 --> 01:18:48.823
You mean to tell me the alert's only
just gone out?

743
01:18:49.742 --> 01:18:51.325
This is Stauffenberg.
Get me General Olbricht.

744
01:18:59.918 --> 01:19:01.335
What's this?

745
01:19:08.302 --> 01:19:09.886
Explain this!
Someone had to do something

746
01:19:09.970 --> 01:19:10.970
while you were
playing dead!

747
01:19:11.054 --> 01:19:12.096
We don't know that
Hitler is not alive.

748
01:19:12.181 --> 01:19:15.266
This is about Germany,
for God's sake, not you!

749
01:19:25.277 --> 01:19:27.695
General Olbricht's office.

750
01:19:28.030 --> 01:19:30.448
Colonel Stauffenberg.
For you, sir.

751
01:19:37.748 --> 01:19:39.582
This is Olbricht.
It's been three hours, Olbricht.

752
01:19:39.666 --> 01:19:40.917
What the hell
have you been doing?

753
01:19:41.251 --> 01:19:43.336
We've had no confirmation
that Hitler was dead.

754
01:19:44.546 --> 01:19:49.884
Damn it! I saw the explosion myself!
We are committed.

755
01:19:50.511 --> 01:19:53.387
Dear God. Now, where is Fromm?
Is he with us?

756
01:19:54.139 --> 01:19:57.183
Is he with us?
No one has spoken to him yet.

757
01:20:09.404 --> 01:20:13.324
You listen to me.
Never mind Germany. Never mind Europe.

758
01:20:13.408 --> 01:20:15.660
Your life is at stake now.

759
01:20:15.744 --> 01:20:18.162
And if you want to live through the night,
you'll do exactly as I say.

760
01:20:18.413 --> 01:20:19.539
The second you
hang up the phone,

761
01:20:19.623 --> 01:20:21.290
initiate Valkyrie
in Fromm's name.

762
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:24.418
Give him the choice to join us, or place him
under immediate arrest.

763
01:20:24.503 --> 01:20:26.379
Do you understand?
Yes.

764
01:20:26.463 --> 01:20:27.964
I'll be in Fromm's
office in 15 minutes.

765
01:20:28.048 --> 01:20:29.423
Be there when I arrive.

766
01:21:01.456 --> 01:21:04.500
Call Beck and the others.
Tell them it's time.

767
01:21:10.132 --> 01:21:12.550
Put me through
to Communications.

768
01:21:13.844 --> 01:21:15.052
This is General Olbricht,

769
01:21:15.345 --> 01:21:17.221
calling on behalf
of General Fromm,

770
01:21:17.306 --> 01:21:19.390
commander of
the Reserve Army.

771
01:21:19.474 --> 01:21:21.767
The Führer,
Adolf Hitler, is dead.

772
01:21:21.852 --> 01:21:23.394
A group of radicals
in the SS

773
01:21:23.478 --> 01:21:25.897
are attempting to seize control
of the government.

774
01:21:25.981 --> 01:21:28.149
Initiate Operation Valkyrie.

775
01:22:04.519 --> 01:22:07.647
You have your orders.
Pass them along.

776
01:22:45.352 --> 01:22:48.020
Battalion. Attention!

777
01:22:53.652 --> 01:22:55.152
The Führer ...

778
01:22:57.990 --> 01:23:00.241
Our Führer, Adolf Hitler,

779
01:23:03.912 --> 01:23:05.162
is dead.

780
01:23:05.872 --> 01:23:07.832
Who told you
the Führer was dead?

781
01:23:07.916 --> 01:23:10.126
General Fellgiebel.
At the Wolf's Lair.

782
01:23:13.755 --> 01:23:15.631
There's no use calling.
All communication lines are down.

783
01:23:15.716 --> 01:23:17.216
Yes. Get me
the Wolf's Lair.

784
01:23:17.300 --> 01:23:18.801
One moment, sir.

785
01:23:22.764 --> 01:23:24.348
Wolf's Lair.
May I connect you?

786
01:23:24.433 --> 01:23:27.727
Yes. General Fromm for
Field Marshal Keitel. Urgent.

787
01:23:31.982 --> 01:23:35.067
Keitel. Yes, I'm sorry to
disturb you, sir,

788
01:23:35.152 --> 01:23:36.861
but I wonder if you could tell me
what's happening.

789
01:23:36.945 --> 01:23:39.697
The most incredible rumors
are circulating in Berlin.

790
01:23:39.781 --> 01:23:41.365
I don't know what you mean.

791
01:23:41.450 --> 01:23:44.744
There's talk that the Führer
has been assassinated.

792
01:23:46.038 --> 01:23:47.955
Another failed attempt.

793
01:23:48.623 --> 01:23:51.125
The Führer was
never in danger.

794
01:23:51.209 --> 01:23:54.587
By the way, where's your man
Stauffenberg?

795
01:23:55.380 --> 01:23:59.216
Stauffenberg? He ...
On his way back to Berlin, I would think.

796
01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:03.220
Let me know when he arrives.
I'd like a word with him.

797
01:24:10.479 --> 01:24:13.981
The Führer's fine.
That is a lie. Adolf Hitler's dead.

798
01:24:14.066 --> 01:24:15.566
Operation Valkyrie
is in effect.

799
01:24:15.650 --> 01:24:17.735
Only I can
initiate Valkyrie.

800
01:24:17.819 --> 01:24:19.070
You did.

801
01:24:28.288 --> 01:24:29.288
This is treason.

802
01:24:29.372 --> 01:24:32.208
Right now, the Reserve Army's
assuming control of Berlin.

803
01:24:32.292 --> 01:24:34.043
Are you with us or not?

804
01:24:34.127 --> 01:24:36.712
Do you realize
what you've done?

805
01:24:36.797 --> 01:24:38.839
The Führer is alive.
I delivered the bomb myself.

806
01:24:38.924 --> 01:24:41.092
I saw the blast.
He is dead.

807
01:24:43.845 --> 01:24:44.929
Are you with us?

808
01:24:45.013 --> 01:24:46.430
I don't believe this is happening.

809
01:24:46.515 --> 01:24:49.809
This is some kind of a joke.
Are you with us or not?

810
01:24:49.893 --> 01:24:52.478
Colonel, if what
you say is true,

811
01:24:53.188 --> 01:24:55.189
you should shoot
yourself immediately.

812
01:24:55.273 --> 01:24:56.607
The rest of you
are under arrest.

813
01:24:56.691 --> 01:24:58.400
No, General. You are.

814
01:25:04.366 --> 01:25:07.284
I don't know where
you think this is going.

815
01:25:10.247 --> 01:25:11.956
Get me Operations.

816
01:25:13.250 --> 01:25:14.583
This is Colonel Stauffenberg.

817
01:25:14.668 --> 01:25:17.128
Seal off the War Ministry
per Operation Valkyrie.

818
01:25:17.212 --> 01:25:18.254
No one gets in or out

819
01:25:18.338 --> 01:25:20.798
without authorization
from General Olbricht's office.

820
01:25:38.191 --> 01:25:40.526
General Beck.

821
01:25:41.361 --> 01:25:42.987
You're not wearing
your uniform, sir.

822
01:25:43.071 --> 01:25:46.157
This should be seen
as a movement of the people.

823
01:25:52.122 --> 01:25:55.166
- Colonel Stauffenberg?
- Yes.

824
01:25:59.838 --> 01:26:03.757
The chief has guaranteed the full support of
the Berlin Police.

825
01:26:05.719 --> 01:26:09.471
You will have no interference from my men.
You have my word.

826
01:26:12.851 --> 01:26:14.226
Thank you.

827
01:26:50.013 --> 01:26:53.432
Colonel Stauffenberg, sir.
We are reporting for duty.

828
01:26:59.064 --> 01:27:00.898
Thank you for coming.

829
01:27:05.737 --> 01:27:09.281
Gentlemen, in three hours
I want confirmation

830
01:27:09.366 --> 01:27:11.200
that the government
quarter is ours

831
01:27:11.284 --> 01:27:14.662
and SS Command has been cleared
of every living soul.

832
01:27:15.247 --> 01:27:17.581
You all know
what must be done.

833
01:27:18.458 --> 01:27:20.960
By nightfall, I want to know
that Hitler's Germany

834
01:27:21.044 --> 01:27:22.795
has seen its last sunrise.

835
01:27:54.744 --> 01:27:56.495
Yes, sir. All replacements
have been authorized.

836
01:27:56.579 --> 01:27:57.997
In fact,
Field Marshal Witzleben

837
01:27:58.081 --> 01:28:00.040
has been appointed Commander-in-Chief
of the Armed Forces.

838
01:28:01.001 --> 01:28:02.501
That's exactly why
he's been appointed.

839
01:28:02.585 --> 01:28:03.711
If he was a member
of the Party,

840
01:28:03.795 --> 01:28:05.129
he'd be locked up
as a suspect.

841
01:28:05.213 --> 01:28:07.381
Yes, sir, I understand your concern,
but this is an emergency.

842
01:28:07.465 --> 01:28:09.174
The commanding officer
at the 11th District, please.

843
01:28:09.259 --> 01:28:10.301
I need a decision, Major.

844
01:28:10.385 --> 01:28:12.177
Tell your men that acts of vengeance
will not be tolerated.

845
01:28:12.262 --> 01:28:14.388
Why hasn't anyone occupied
the Tegel broadcasting station?

846
01:28:14.472 --> 01:28:16.056
Can I speak to the commanding officer
in Hannover, please?

847
01:28:16.141 --> 01:28:17.308
We represent a different
form of government.

848
01:28:17.392 --> 01:28:18.809
I'd be careful
who you said that to.

849
01:28:18.893 --> 01:28:20.477
Loyalty to the Party
isn't what it used to be.

850
01:28:20.562 --> 01:28:21.895
Yes, Paris. France.

851
01:28:22.022 --> 01:28:23.355
Not since they
murdered the Führer.

852
01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:24.982
And, Josef. Thank you.

853
01:28:25.066 --> 01:28:26.400
You've made
the right decision.

854
01:28:28.528 --> 01:28:29.570
District 13 is ours.

855
01:28:41.958 --> 01:28:43.625
By order of Field Marshal
von Witzleben,

856
01:28:43.710 --> 01:28:46.920
you are under arrest
for crimes against the state.

857
01:28:55.638 --> 01:28:58.015
This is Stauffenberg. I'm trying to connect
with Major-General Thadden.

858
01:28:58.099 --> 01:28:59.516
No, I've already spoken
to 413 Battalion.

859
01:28:59.601 --> 01:29:01.226
You'll have no trouble
getting reinforcements.

860
01:29:01.311 --> 01:29:03.187
The order explaining everything
will be in your hand shortly.

861
01:29:03.313 --> 01:29:05.939
No, these are your orders.
Excellent.

862
01:29:07.984 --> 01:29:10.527
My wife is in Bamberg
with my children.

863
01:29:10.612 --> 01:29:12.029
Would you please try to raise them
on the phone?

864
01:29:12.113 --> 01:29:14.156
Yes, sir.
Thank you.

865
01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:16.116
General Schwedler has issued
the Valkyrie orders

866
01:29:16.201 --> 01:29:17.242
and has sealed off
headquarters.

867
01:29:17.327 --> 01:29:19.203
Good. Check on the radio stations
every 20 minutes

868
01:29:19.287 --> 01:29:21.497
till we have confirmation
they're ours.

869
01:29:34.010 --> 01:29:35.219
Well, with all due respect, sir,

870
01:29:35.303 --> 01:29:36.595
you can't believe
everything you hear.

871
01:29:36.679 --> 01:29:38.514
That is SS propaganda.
He's dead.

872
01:29:38.598 --> 01:29:42.643
Only the commander of the Home Army is
authorized to give orders.

873
01:29:42.727 --> 01:29:44.895
General? Sir.

874
01:29:46.106 --> 01:29:47.731
Hello, Christian?
Our men in the transport offices

875
01:29:47.816 --> 01:29:49.358
have secured the railway
communications network,

876
01:29:49.442 --> 01:29:50.442
but there are
repeater stations ...

877
01:29:50.527 --> 01:29:52.403
Yes. I give you my word. ... telephone and
telegraph offices,

878
01:29:52.487 --> 01:29:54.571
emergency broadcast outposts.
We need more men.

879
01:29:54.656 --> 01:29:57.199
Thank you. Give my best
to your family.

880
01:29:57.283 --> 01:29:58.742
He's with us.

881
01:29:59.661 --> 01:30:00.869
Mertz? Call Potsdam.

882
01:30:00.954 --> 01:30:03.372
Tell them to place all available units
under our control.

883
01:30:03.456 --> 01:30:05.249
You have your men.
Now get control of the radio.

884
01:30:05.333 --> 01:30:07.251
We have control
of the government quarter.

885
01:30:07.335 --> 01:30:09.336
We don't have Berlin yet.

886
01:30:32.569 --> 01:30:35.446
- What is it now, Sergeant?
- Arrest orders, sir.

887
01:30:35.530 --> 01:30:37.406
One from Colonel Stauffenberg
in the War Ministry

888
01:30:37.490 --> 01:30:40.117
to arrest Reich
Minister Göbbels.

889
01:30:40.201 --> 01:30:42.119
The other is from
the Wolf's Lair,

890
01:30:42.203 --> 01:30:44.204
to arrest
Colonel Stauffenberg.

891
01:30:50.003 --> 01:30:51.920
Send them both through.

892
01:30:52.547 --> 01:30:55.215
Our job is not to
interpret orders,

893
01:30:55.341 --> 01:30:57.968
our job is to pass
them along, regardless.

894
01:30:58.052 --> 01:31:00.762
- Yes, but ...
- That will be all, Sergeant.

895
01:31:20.575 --> 01:31:22.993
This is treason!
You're all going to pay for this!

896
01:31:23.077 --> 01:31:25.078
Do you hear me?

897
01:31:38.301 --> 01:31:39.843
New arrest orders, sir.

898
01:31:39.928 --> 01:31:41.595
For Stauffenberg
and Göbbels.

899
01:31:43.264 --> 01:31:45.182
Do we arrest them both?

900
01:31:46.184 --> 01:31:48.727
I would hate to find out I'm being
taken advantage of.

901
01:31:48.811 --> 01:31:50.562
You really think
it's a coup?

902
01:31:51.397 --> 01:31:53.106
Of that I am certain.

903
01:31:53.233 --> 01:31:55.984
What I can't say is
which side we're on.

904
01:31:56.653 --> 01:31:58.362
Come with me.

905
01:31:58.446 --> 01:31:59.988
District 4, Dresden and Leipzig.

906
01:32:00.073 --> 01:32:01.448
District 12, Wiesbaden.
District 9 ...

907
01:32:01.533 --> 01:32:03.158
They've had no trouble
getting reinforcements,

908
01:32:03.243 --> 01:32:06.203
and I rely on you seeing that this
gets done.

909
01:32:09.082 --> 01:32:10.916
I've just spoken
to Colonel Linstow.

910
01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:15.003
They've arrested 1,200 SS and Gestapo
officials in Paris.

911
01:32:15.088 --> 01:32:16.672
Not a single shot fired.

912
01:32:16.756 --> 01:32:18.423
Early reports
from Vienna are good.

913
01:32:18.508 --> 01:32:20.842
I'm waiting on word
from Prague.

914
01:32:20.927 --> 01:32:22.302
Incredible.

915
01:32:55.837 --> 01:32:57.337
I'm ready to be connected.

916
01:33:11.853 --> 01:33:13.812
Minister Göbbels?

917
01:33:14.063 --> 01:33:15.897
What can I do
for you, Major?

918
01:33:15.982 --> 01:33:19.109
My battalion has an order to blockade
the government quarter

919
01:33:19.193 --> 01:33:21.320
and place you
under arrest.

920
01:33:24.657 --> 01:33:27.701
Are you a dedicated
National Socialist, Major?

921
01:33:28.953 --> 01:33:30.245
Yes, sir.

922
01:33:44.552 --> 01:33:48.347
Major Remer here.
Hello?

923
01:33:51.392 --> 01:33:53.435
Do you recognize my voice?

924
01:33:55.897 --> 01:33:57.147
Yes, my Führer.

925
01:33:57.231 --> 01:33:59.358
Then listen to me
very carefully.

926
01:34:01.903 --> 01:34:04.488
I want these traitors
taken alive.

927
01:34:06.824 --> 01:34:08.367
Yes, my Führer.

928
01:34:13.039 --> 01:34:14.873
You heard what he said.

929
01:34:14.957 --> 01:34:17.334
The Führer wants
the traitors taken alive.

930
01:34:19.462 --> 01:34:20.754
Yes, sir.

931
01:34:45.988 --> 01:34:50.701
It's a coup, all right.
We can't afford to remain neutral any longer.

932
01:34:54.956 --> 01:34:57.124
You have to make
a decision.

933
01:34:58.876 --> 01:35:02.212
When it's over,
we better wind up on the right side.

934
01:35:08.761 --> 01:35:10.137
Very well.

935
01:35:12.890 --> 01:35:14.891
Send through all communications
from the Wolf's Lair.

936
01:35:14.976 --> 01:35:17.769
Stop all communications
from Stauffenberg.

937
01:35:23.818 --> 01:35:25.485
Release these men!

938
01:35:27.363 --> 01:35:29.197
But they're part
of the coup.

939
01:35:29.282 --> 01:35:31.742
I've just been on the phone
with Hitler himself.

940
01:35:31.826 --> 01:35:33.243
We are the coup,
you idiot.

941
01:35:33.578 --> 01:35:34.995
We've been duped.

942
01:35:37.915 --> 01:35:40.500
We've lost contact
with District 11.

943
01:35:43.838 --> 01:35:45.756
The switchboard
is overloaded.

944
01:35:45.882 --> 01:35:47.841
Give it 10 minutes
and try again.

945
01:35:52.764 --> 01:35:55.056
Give me General Bieler,
District 11.

946
01:35:55.141 --> 01:35:56.516
We still need ...

947
01:35:56.559 --> 01:35:58.310
I don't want to leave any section ...
Keep trying.

948
01:35:58.394 --> 01:36:02.147
Out of my way.
Where is General Fromm?

949
01:36:05.443 --> 01:36:08.695
General Fromm is no longer
in command. I am.

950
01:36:08.780 --> 01:36:11.406
Beck? What are you doing here?
What is going on?

951
01:36:11.491 --> 01:36:12.991
The Führer is dead.

952
01:36:13.367 --> 01:36:14.618
The SS are staging a coup.

953
01:36:14.702 --> 01:36:17.329
We've initiated Operation Valkyrie
to crush the uprising

954
01:36:17.413 --> 01:36:18.955
and save Hitler's Germany.

955
01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:22.334
You will present the order
to your troops.

956
01:36:22.418 --> 01:36:25.587
I will do no such thing until
I speak to General Fromm.

957
01:36:25.671 --> 01:36:29.049
You will follow your orders,
or you are under arrest.

958
01:36:30.510 --> 01:36:36.097
This is treason. I will take no part.
The Führer is not dead.

959
01:36:37.058 --> 01:36:38.975
The Führer is not dead!
Stop him!

960
01:36:39.060 --> 01:36:42.562
The Führer is not dead!
The Führer is not dead!

961
01:36:42.647 --> 01:36:46.066
I have sworn an oath!
This is treason!

962
01:36:46.150 --> 01:36:49.319
You all swore an oath!
Listen to what I have to say.

963
01:36:49.403 --> 01:36:52.948
You are all making
a terrible mistake!

964
01:36:53.783 --> 01:37:00.247
The Führer is not dead!

965
01:37:02.250 --> 01:37:04.251
Please try
my wife again.

966
01:37:13.177 --> 01:37:14.803
Bamberg, please.

967
01:37:21.269 --> 01:37:23.186
Take your hands off me!

968
01:37:29.110 --> 01:37:30.235
Sir.

969
01:37:41.497 --> 01:37:44.165
Over 215 enemy tanks
have been annihilated

970
01:37:44.250 --> 01:37:46.167
in the past week alone.

971
01:37:46.252 --> 01:37:48.795
The air force, engaged in
low-flying offensives

972
01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:51.381
- on enemy concentrations ...
- Lieutenant.

973
01:37:51.465 --> 01:37:52.507
I can't get through
to General Gerlach.

974
01:37:52.592 --> 01:37:55.802
Send a runner down to his office.
Bring him here.

975
01:37:58.806 --> 01:38:00.348
Yes, thank you.

976
01:38:01.642 --> 01:38:02.809
Yes, this is Stauffenberg.

977
01:38:02.894 --> 01:38:05.312
I was speaking to the General
about five minutes ago.

978
01:38:05.396 --> 01:38:06.688
He told me
he'd return my call.

979
01:38:06.772 --> 01:38:08.189
I've yet to
hear from him.

980
01:38:08.274 --> 01:38:10.775
I trust everything in your district
is under control?

981
01:38:10.860 --> 01:38:13.320
Hans, I need your answer.

982
01:38:13.404 --> 01:38:15.071
There's no more time
for indecision.

983
01:38:15.156 --> 01:38:17.782
And the General knows
I'm waiting?

984
01:38:17.867 --> 01:38:19.326
I'm ordering you to put him on
the phone immediately.

985
01:38:19.410 --> 01:38:21.244
The army gave their oath
to a liar, Hans.

986
01:38:21.329 --> 01:38:22.579
Hello?

987
01:38:22.663 --> 01:38:23.914
One who's broken his own oath ...

988
01:38:23.998 --> 01:38:26.374
Hello?
... to the people a hundred times over.

989
01:38:26.459 --> 01:38:28.293
Hans, listen to me ...

990
01:38:54.779 --> 01:38:57.864
This operation has been terminated!
Stand down!

991
01:39:03.371 --> 01:39:06.831
Today, an attempt was made
on the Führer's life.

992
01:39:06.916 --> 01:39:09.376
The Führer himself
suffered no major injuries

993
01:39:09.460 --> 01:39:11.336
beyond light burns
and bruises.

994
01:39:11.420 --> 01:39:13.797
He resumed his work
immediately.

995
01:39:13.881 --> 01:39:16.466
Those seriously wounded
include General Schmundt,

996
01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:19.386
Colonel Brandt
and staff assistant Berger.

997
01:39:19.470 --> 01:39:21.888
Lighter injuries were sustained by
General Jodl

998
01:39:21.973 --> 01:39:25.100
and Generals Korten, Buhle,
Bodenschatz, Heusinger ...

999
01:39:25.184 --> 01:39:28.561
Send the following orders to
all Reserve Army commanders.

1000
01:39:28.646 --> 01:39:31.564
"Broadcast incorrect.
Führer is dead.

1001
01:39:34.235 --> 01:39:36.903
"Operation Valkyrie
still in effect."

1002
01:39:37.738 --> 01:39:41.992
... and, as scheduled,
received Mussolini for an afternoon briefing.

1003
01:39:42.076 --> 01:39:44.786
Long live our Führer,
Adolf Hitler,

1004
01:39:44.870 --> 01:39:48.123
whom the almighty God
has so visibly blessed today.

1005
01:39:51.961 --> 01:40:00.093
I saw the blast.

1006
01:40:09.270 --> 01:40:12.522
Today an attempt was made
on the Führer's life.

1007
01:40:12.606 --> 01:40:15.025
The Führer himself
suffered no major injuries

1008
01:40:15.109 --> 01:40:17.110
beyond light burns
and bruises.

1009
01:40:17.194 --> 01:40:18.278
I'm sorry.

1010
01:40:18.362 --> 01:40:20.196
He resumed
his work immediately.

1011
01:40:20.281 --> 01:40:23.033
Those seriously wounded
include General Schmundt,

1012
01:40:23.117 --> 01:40:26.661
Colonel Brandt
and staff assistant Berger.

1013
01:40:26.746 --> 01:40:29.789
Lighter injuries were sustained by
General Jodl

1014
01:40:29.874 --> 01:40:33.460
and Generals Korten, Buhle,
Bodenschatz, Heusinger ...

1015
01:40:39.967 --> 01:40:41.593
Shortly after the attempt
on his life,

1016
01:40:41.677 --> 01:40:44.220
the Führer was joined
by Reichsmarschall Göring

1017
01:40:44.305 --> 01:40:47.932
and, as scheduled,
received Mussolini for an afternoon briefing.

1018
01:40:48.017 --> 01:40:51.561
Stay tuned for the Führer's address
to the German people.

1019
01:40:51.645 --> 01:40:52.979
My family?

1020
01:40:54.482 --> 01:40:56.483
Our lines have been cut.

1021
01:41:00.112 --> 01:41:01.780
I'm sorry.

1022
01:41:03.199 --> 01:41:04.908
Go.

1023
01:41:05.451 --> 01:41:07.243
It's all right. Go.

1024
01:41:24.011 --> 01:41:26.971
General. Sir.
We have to get you out of here.

1025
01:42:53.684 --> 01:42:55.768
Get him out of here.

1026
01:42:55.853 --> 01:42:57.520
- Stop!
- Stand down!

1027
01:42:57.605 --> 01:42:59.939
I said stop!
I said stand down!

1028
01:43:27.468 --> 01:43:29.010
Hold your fire!

1029
01:43:38.187 --> 01:43:40.021
Colonel Stauffenberg?

1030
01:43:43.442 --> 01:43:46.402
By orders of the Führer,
you're under arrest.

1031
01:44:09.218 --> 01:44:12.595
If you have any last messages
to your wives and children,

1032
01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:14.514
I will hear them now.

1033
01:44:16.684 --> 01:44:17.892
Very well.

1034
01:44:17.977 --> 01:44:20.103
A court-martial convened by me
in the Führer's absence

1035
01:44:20.187 --> 01:44:21.312
will pronounce sentence.

1036
01:44:21.397 --> 01:44:23.273
Beck, you're under arrest.

1037
01:44:23.357 --> 01:44:28.653
Colonel Mertz von Quirnheim,
General Olbricht, Lieutenant Häften,

1038
01:44:28.737 --> 01:44:30.947
and the Colonel whose name
I will not mention,

1039
01:44:31.031 --> 01:44:32.407
are condemned to death.

1040
01:44:32.491 --> 01:44:34.951
General. My orders are
to take these men alive.

1041
01:44:35.035 --> 01:44:36.536
Noted, Major.

1042
01:44:38.163 --> 01:44:40.206
I'd like a pistol,
please.

1043
01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:44.794
For personal reasons.

1044
01:45:03.105 --> 01:45:04.605
Get on with it.

1045
01:45:04.690 --> 01:45:06.899
With all respect ...
That will be all, Major.

1046
01:45:07.026 --> 01:45:09.277
Killing us won't hide
your involvement.

1047
01:45:09.361 --> 01:45:12.613
My involvement?
I don't know what you're talking about.

1048
01:45:12.698 --> 01:45:13.990
You knew and did nothing.

1049
01:45:14.074 --> 01:45:15.533
You're as guilty
as any of us.

1050
01:45:15.617 --> 01:45:17.452
Spare me, Lieutenant.

1051
01:45:17.953 --> 01:45:19.787
No one will be spared.

1052
01:45:35.137 --> 01:45:37.430
I'm thinking of
earlier times.

1053
01:45:43.437 --> 01:45:47.023
This is an outrage that has never before
been perpetrated here!

1054
01:45:47.107 --> 01:45:49.859
A field marshal
and a general

1055
01:45:49.943 --> 01:45:52.153
declare that they could
do things better

1056
01:45:52.237 --> 01:45:54.947
than he who is
the Führer of us all!

1057
01:45:55.032 --> 01:45:58.659
You confess to having said this?
Yes.

1058
01:46:03.749 --> 01:46:05.375
My fellow Germans.

1059
01:46:05.459 --> 01:46:08.127
I speak to you tonight
for two reasons.

1060
01:46:09.338 --> 01:46:13.633
First, so that you can hear my voice
and know that I am unhurt.

1061
01:46:14.551 --> 01:46:18.638
Second, so that you may know
the details of a crime

1062
01:46:18.722 --> 01:46:21.808
without parallel
in German history.

1063
01:46:21.892 --> 01:46:26.062
A small clique of ambitious,
dishonorable officers

1064
01:46:26.146 --> 01:46:28.481
have conspired
to eliminate me.

1065
01:46:29.983 --> 01:46:35.488
Except for a few bruises and burns,
I was completely untouched.

1066
01:46:37.157 --> 01:46:39.826
I see in this
the hand of Providence,

1067
01:46:41.161 --> 01:46:43.621
directing me
to complete my work.

1068
01:46:53.257 --> 01:46:55.091
Look them in the eye.

1069
01:46:57.219 --> 01:46:59.429
They'll remember you.

1070
01:46:59.513 --> 01:47:00.888
Olbricht!

1071
01:47:11.275 --> 01:47:12.775
Make ready.

1072
01:47:28.208 --> 01:47:30.543
Well, we have to show the world

1073
01:47:30.627 --> 01:47:32.587
that not all of us
were like him.

1074
01:47:37.551 --> 01:47:39.635
Safe! Stand!

1075
01:47:43.724 --> 01:47:44.891
Fire!

1076
01:47:46.393 --> 01:47:47.560
Stand!

1077
01:48:08.874 --> 01:48:10.374
Stauffenberg!

1078
01:48:14.379 --> 01:48:17.798
The people know we put our principles
above personal gain.

1079
01:48:17.883 --> 01:48:19.258
Make ready!

1080
01:48:23.013 --> 01:48:24.096
Aim!

1081
01:48:40.531 --> 01:48:42.490
Safe! Stand!

1082
01:48:49.081 --> 01:48:52.375
You may hand us over
to the executioner,

1083
01:48:52.459 --> 01:48:54.085
but in three months' time,

1084
01:48:54.169 --> 01:48:58.047
the disgusted and harried people
will bring you to book

1085
01:48:58.131 --> 01:49:02.301
and drag you alive through the dirt
in the streets.

1086
01:49:03.095 --> 01:49:05.221
Take him away.

1087
01:49:09.685 --> 01:49:11.978
Make ready.

1088
01:49:14.147 --> 01:49:15.439
Aim.

1089
01:49:16.692 --> 01:49:18.568
Long live sacred Germany!
Fire!

1090
01:49:20.737 --> 01:49:22.737
Stand.
